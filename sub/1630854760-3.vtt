00:01.410 --> 00:04.336
(suspenseful music)
(man sighs)

00:06.232 --> 00:08.156
(buzzer sounding)

00:08.234 --> 00:10.426
(metal door opening)

00:11.828 --> 00:15.222
- Mr. Wheeler,
your attorney's here.

00:15.924 --> 00:18.425
Come on.
Let's go.

00:18.577 --> 00:20.436
- Don't touch me!

00:35.594 --> 00:37.519
(keys jingling loudly)

00:37.538 --> 00:40.456
(buzzer, door opening)

00:45.529 --> 00:47.529
Double word.

00:47.548 --> 00:50.031
(chuckles)
45 points.

00:50.109 --> 00:52.776
- No. That is not a word.

00:52.795 --> 00:54.720
That is a proper noun.

00:54.871 --> 00:56.630
- Kleenex. It's a word.

00:56.782 --> 00:58.615
It's a brand.

00:58.634 --> 01:00.542
- It can be both.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.544
- You are so full of it.

01:02.563 --> 01:05.046
- Yeah, well, I am not givin' up
my points.

01:05.124 --> 01:07.291
- Hm... Let's just see.
Gimme that board.

01:07.293 --> 01:09.193
- Here you go.
- Gimme.

01:17.970 --> 01:19.803
- You're almost done.

01:19.805 --> 01:20.987
- Yeah, almost.

01:21.064 --> 01:23.248
I was thinking maybe
it's the four of us.

01:23.325 --> 01:25.826
You see that's Dad, and me,

01:25.978 --> 01:28.812
and you, and Matthew.

01:28.831 --> 01:31.665
- He's the little branch.
- Hmm...

01:32.334 --> 01:35.427
I really wanted to finish it
this morning, but...

01:36.246 --> 01:38.472
- It's great, Mom.

01:39.767 --> 01:40.933
You'll get it done.

01:41.009 --> 01:42.434
- Hmm...
(knocking on door)

01:42.544 --> 01:44.845
Intruder alert.
(dog yelping)

01:44.921 --> 01:47.013
- Shh.
- Oh, hey, little guy.

01:47.166 --> 01:48.423
(barking)
Well, don't mind me.

01:48.500 --> 01:50.442
Danny, I thought maybe
you could use a snack too.

01:50.594 --> 01:52.669
I made cookies,
chocolate chip walnut.

01:52.688 --> 01:55.263
- Chester, shh.

01:55.282 --> 01:56.115
- Oh, you know what?

01:56.358 --> 01:58.266
I am fostering a rescue
this month.

01:58.344 --> 01:59.785
He must smell her on me.

01:59.862 --> 02:01.286
- I'm so sorry.

02:02.030 --> 02:04.030
- Hey, you're still playing?

02:04.625 --> 02:07.793
Uh, your brother's downstairs.
He said you were
taking him bowling?

02:07.870 --> 02:09.202
- Oh. I ...

02:09.204 --> 02:12.798
that wasn't like a real plan.
I can... I can stay.

02:12.875 --> 02:14.191
- No, no, no. You should go.

02:14.209 --> 02:17.719
The truth is,
I kinda need to rest my eyes.

02:18.714 --> 02:19.713
- Okay.

02:19.807 --> 02:20.973
- Okay.

02:21.124 --> 02:24.268
- I love you.
- I love you.

02:29.224 --> 02:31.966
- Is it too bright in here?
- Oh, you know what?
Let me close those.

02:32.044 --> 02:35.571
- Oh no, actually
just leave it, please.

02:37.158 --> 02:39.641
I really love that view.

02:39.718 --> 02:41.660
- Sure. Of course.

02:41.737 --> 02:43.236
Whatever you want.

02:43.572 --> 02:48.125
- I mean, you can hate her
all you want,
but these cookies are legit.

02:49.912 --> 02:52.337
- I'm telling you, it's fake.

02:52.414 --> 02:53.154
- What is?

02:53.232 --> 02:54.822
- Her whole thing.

02:54.842 --> 02:57.843
I mean she's always finding ways
to remind us what
a saint she is.

02:57.994 --> 03:00.971
Now she's rescuing animals?

03:02.074 --> 03:06.059
- Maybe she's just...
a good person?

03:19.441 --> 03:21.158
Let's go, man.

03:26.098 --> 03:29.374
(exhales frustratingly)
(indistinct chatter)

03:35.791 --> 03:37.441
- Hey ...

03:37.443 --> 03:39.092
Danny.

03:40.462 --> 03:41.220
- Hey, Brittany.

03:41.255 --> 03:42.946
- How are you doing?

03:42.948 --> 03:45.224
I heard about your mom.

03:45.375 --> 03:48.301
Is she... still in the hospital?

03:48.454 --> 03:50.470
- They just brought her home.

03:50.622 --> 03:52.314
- Oh that's great.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.383
So was it Stage 4?

03:55.461 --> 03:58.028
Like when she was diagnosed?

03:58.888 --> 04:00.814
You must be so devastated.

04:00.890 --> 04:02.574
I can't imagine.

04:02.726 --> 04:04.409
If you ever wanna talk
or anything...

04:04.561 --> 04:05.819
- She's not dead.

04:05.895 --> 04:07.746
- Oh.
- And you and I,

04:07.897 --> 04:09.806
are not friends, okay?

04:09.825 --> 04:11.399
- I was just trying to be nice.

04:11.477 --> 04:12.509
- Were you?

04:12.511 --> 04:15.337
- Hey, uh, can we get
some food maybe?

04:28.010 --> 04:29.768
(chatting indistinctly)

04:29.919 --> 04:32.562
Forget it, man?
Just let it go, alright?

04:34.090 --> 04:36.182
- You guys know what you want?
- I gotta pee.

04:36.335 --> 04:39.278
A cheeseburger no onions.
- Okay. Yep.

04:41.598 --> 04:44.449
Cheeseburger no onions.
And for you?

04:46.361 --> 04:48.120
- Sorry. Um...

04:48.271 --> 04:51.014
Yeah, I... whatever,
I'll get the same thing

04:51.033 --> 04:53.375
with uh everything on it.

04:57.298 --> 05:01.875
- You'd think cool girls
would have cooler places to be.

05:01.951 --> 05:05.178
- Trust me, they're not.

05:10.035 --> 05:12.811
You just transferred
to Spalding, yeah?

05:12.888 --> 05:14.980
- Last month.

05:16.466 --> 05:19.133
What was she bothering you
about?

05:19.987 --> 05:22.637
Sorry, you don't have
to answer that.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.197
- No, it's okay.

05:25.734 --> 05:27.551
My mom's sick.

05:27.569 --> 05:28.735
Really sick.

05:28.829 --> 05:31.388
And Brittany was asking me
all these questions.

05:31.390 --> 05:34.666
And I swear she hasn't spoken
to me since the seventh grade.

05:34.743 --> 05:37.911
- Death tourist.
- Death tourist?

05:37.987 --> 05:42.323
- Yeah, someone whose life is
so easy that they like glom onto
other peoples' tragedies

05:42.343 --> 05:44.401
for a hit of actual emotion.

05:44.419 --> 05:46.011
It happened to me a lot um...

05:46.162 --> 05:50.206
when my parents died
before I moved here
to live with my aunt.

05:51.334 --> 05:54.911
It was a drunk driver.
Jumped a highway divide.

05:54.913 --> 05:57.022
- That's...

05:57.766 --> 05:59.583
that's messed up.

05:59.601 --> 06:01.360
- Yeah.

06:02.604 --> 06:05.922
- I'm Danny by the way.

06:05.924 --> 06:07.574
- I'm Leanna.

06:08.369 --> 06:09.851
Do you want fries with that?

06:09.928 --> 06:12.612
Because they don't
actually come with.

06:12.764 --> 06:14.373
(chuckles)
- Yeah.

06:14.524 --> 06:17.459
Fries would be great.
- Okay.

06:20.997 --> 06:24.049
(insects chirring)

06:26.461 --> 06:29.262
(soft music)

06:42.961 --> 06:46.888
(door creaking)
(mother moaning)

06:46.965 --> 06:49.491
- Isabel, can you hear me?

06:50.744 --> 06:52.744
Isabel, can you hear me?

06:52.821 --> 06:55.396
This is what we talked about?
(Isabel groaning)

06:55.474 --> 06:57.582
- Shh...
(Danny): What's going on?

06:57.734 --> 06:59.400
- Danny, wait outside please.
- What are you doing?

06:59.494 --> 07:01.068
- I'm adjusting her morphine.

07:01.146 --> 07:03.813
- Well, clearly,
it's not working!
You need to give her more!

07:03.815 --> 07:05.740
- Danny. Please.
Wait outside.

07:05.817 --> 07:07.909
(Isabel moaning)
Shh. Shh.

07:07.928 --> 07:10.745
It's okay.
It's okay...

07:10.764 --> 07:13.140
Shh, shh, shh.

07:15.827 --> 07:17.978
Shh, shh...

07:22.759 --> 07:24.668
Shh, shh...

07:24.670 --> 07:26.611
It's okay. It's okay.

07:27.355 --> 07:29.531
- Your father wants you
to come in.

07:30.342 --> 07:32.342
- Is it happening now?

07:32.344 --> 07:33.785
Is she dying?

07:33.862 --> 07:38.540
- Whatever you'd like to say
to her, I think now is the time.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.460
- Okay.

07:42.629 --> 07:44.779
(father): It's okay, sweetheart.

07:44.856 --> 07:46.506
It's alright.

07:52.030 --> 07:54.556
- You get off on it, don't you?

07:55.309 --> 07:58.059
Going from house to house.

07:58.720 --> 08:01.104
Watching people die.

08:02.816 --> 08:06.401
You're like some sorta...
death tourist.

08:19.666 --> 08:22.751
(crying)

08:40.579 --> 08:42.729
(gasps)

08:54.609 --> 08:57.160
(sobbing)

08:58.688 --> 09:00.038
God...

09:00.690 --> 09:02.749
please...

09:04.828 --> 09:08.997
I finished it, see?

09:09.791 --> 09:13.260
I looked up online how to do it.

09:18.207 --> 09:21.560
<i> - May the Lord Bless thee</i>
<i> and keep thee.</i>

09:22.621 --> 09:26.231
May the angels lead you
to your savior.

09:26.308 --> 09:30.217
You are a sign
of his presence to us.

09:30.237 --> 09:33.146
We are here today to seek

09:33.298 --> 09:35.073
and to receive comfort.

09:35.909 --> 09:40.895
We come together
as our hearts ache
for the loss of his daughter.

09:40.972 --> 09:42.989
May she rest in peace.

09:43.141 --> 09:46.084
May the Lord show his face...

09:49.756 --> 09:52.757
(chilling music)

09:53.743 --> 09:56.077
<i> (in dream):</i>
<i> You get off on it, don't you?</i>

09:56.096 --> 09:59.322
<i> You're like some sort of...</i>
<i> death tourist.</i>

09:59.324 --> 10:01.825
<i> (Isabel, in dream):</i>
<i> That's Dad, and me,</i>

10:01.827 --> 10:03.751
<i> and you, and Matthew.</i>

10:03.770 --> 10:06.146
<i> I love you.</i>
(gasping)

10:07.332 --> 10:09.357
(grunts)

10:19.678 --> 10:22.078
(suspenseful music)

10:35.451 --> 10:37.427
(dog barking)

11:04.831 --> 11:08.241
(swelling, dramatic music)

11:08.393 --> 11:10.418
(buzzer)

11:11.413 --> 11:14.089
- Hey, Danny,

11:15.083 --> 11:17.801
nice to see you.
Here, take a seat.

11:18.327 --> 11:19.752
- Who is he?

11:19.829 --> 11:23.664
- This is Dr. Gary Weiss.
He's a forensic psychiatrist.

11:23.742 --> 11:27.686
-I already told you,
I'm not doing this.

11:27.837 --> 11:29.095
- It's just a conversation.

11:29.172 --> 11:30.855
He'll ask you some questions...

11:31.082 --> 11:32.932
- He'll use those answers
against me.

11:33.084 --> 11:36.385
So you can put me in a...
in a mental hospital.
I'm not crazy.

11:36.387 --> 11:39.513
How many times do I have
to have this conversation?
I'm not...

11:39.591 --> 11:42.108
- Listen to me.
As your attorney,
I strongly recommend...

11:42.260 --> 11:43.943
- No. I'm done. C'mon!

11:44.095 --> 11:45.278
Hey, c'mon. Open the door.

11:45.430 --> 11:46.854
- Danny, I promise you
I have no agenda.

11:46.932 --> 11:47.931
-I'm done.
- Let's just talk.

11:47.949 --> 11:50.024
- Don't touch me.

11:50.026 --> 11:53.453
Stop!
- Mike, a little help here.

11:53.547 --> 11:56.256
(theme music)

12:09.545 --> 12:12.564
- At the moment, he's looking
at three failing grades,

12:12.715 --> 12:14.399
which would be enough
to hold him back.

12:14.626 --> 12:16.292
- Well, he has missed
a month of school.

12:16.403 --> 12:19.645
What if he takes incompletes
and finishes his assignments
over the summer?

12:19.798 --> 12:22.407
I mean there's gotta be
some kinda leeway
given what he's been through.

12:22.484 --> 12:25.910
- Well, of course, but it's not
just his academics.

12:26.062 --> 12:28.246
There may be underlying issues
here,

12:28.397 --> 12:31.824
issues that predate
his mother's illness.

12:31.977 --> 12:34.210
- What do you mean?

12:36.072 --> 12:38.314
- Ah, Danny, come sit.

12:38.333 --> 12:40.925
- Sorry, Mr. Bryer kept me
after class.

12:41.077 --> 12:42.819
- I was just explaining
to your dad ...

12:42.821 --> 12:44.929
- What issues?

12:45.039 --> 12:47.991
- Over the past year,
several of his teachers

12:48.009 --> 12:50.602
have noted persistent trouble
concentrating,

12:50.753 --> 12:54.272
frequent irritability,
and occasional outbursts.

12:54.349 --> 12:56.833
- And this is the first
I'm hearing of it?

12:56.926 --> 12:59.110
- I spoke with your wife
several times.

12:59.262 --> 13:01.187
I explained to her
our recommendation

13:01.339 --> 13:04.616
that Danny be assessed
by a mental health professional.

13:04.692 --> 13:07.026
Someone with uh, expertise.

13:07.178 --> 13:09.120
She insisted there was no need.

13:09.272 --> 13:12.849
Oh I'm sorry, I assumed
the two of you...

13:12.851 --> 13:15.018
- No, no, of course. Um...

13:15.036 --> 13:16.961
Look uh, the truth is um,

13:17.188 --> 13:20.948
his mom was a little
over-protective when it...
went it came to Danny.

13:21.026 --> 13:23.450
She wasn't always forthcoming.

13:23.470 --> 13:24.877
- Yes, I understand.

13:24.954 --> 13:27.806
Unfortunately, a traumatic loss
like this

13:27.882 --> 13:29.382
can sometimes lead

13:29.701 --> 13:32.535
(voice echoes):
...to an acceleration
of psychological symptoms.

13:32.554 --> 13:34.479
If there is an underlying
condition,

13:34.630 --> 13:38.708
whether that's disordered
thinking or excess anxiety...

13:38.726 --> 13:40.485
(loud hum)

13:40.636 --> 13:41.878
- Danny.

13:41.880 --> 13:44.239
Excuse me for a second.

13:45.567 --> 13:47.200
Danny!

13:49.404 --> 13:52.288
(panting)

13:54.000 --> 13:56.817
(indistinct muffled voices)

13:56.895 --> 13:58.461
- Hey!

14:00.415 --> 14:02.340
You okay?

14:02.917 --> 14:04.825
- Yeah.
I'm fine.

14:04.845 --> 14:06.085
- Are you sure?

14:06.237 --> 14:09.430
- Yeah, I uh, sometimes
I just get these...

14:11.092 --> 14:13.759
I dunno, like,
it's hard to explain.

14:13.912 --> 14:16.855
- I'm sorry about your mom.

14:18.507 --> 14:21.675
I sent you a text.
- Yeah. I, I got it.
It was really nice.

14:21.695 --> 14:24.270
I, I, I, I meant to... to...
to... write you back,

14:24.347 --> 14:27.031
I just, you know, we had family
in town and...

14:27.775 --> 14:29.534
(school bell ringing)

14:29.761 --> 14:31.018
I'm failing everything.

14:31.096 --> 14:33.997
- Yeah. Believe me.
I get it.

14:36.025 --> 14:37.876
Well, I'm... I'm gonna be
late for Trig.

14:38.027 --> 14:42.130
But don't be a stranger, yeah?

14:44.718 --> 14:47.176
Okay, let's go.

14:55.729 --> 14:58.313
(dog barking in the distance)

15:03.645 --> 15:05.811
- Hey, Danny. Uh...

15:06.389 --> 15:08.531
You uh, come sit, please.

15:11.653 --> 15:13.244
Okay, uh...

15:13.396 --> 15:17.140
alright so I just got off
the phone with Mrs. Epps, um,

15:17.158 --> 15:19.325
we want you to have
a chance to reset.

15:19.477 --> 15:22.569
So she's suggesting you take
a leave this semester.

15:22.647 --> 15:24.405
- And do what?

15:24.482 --> 15:25.815
- Well, um...

15:26.259 --> 15:29.594
I'd like you
to start seeing a psychiatrist.

15:29.671 --> 15:31.596
- Somebody that you like.

15:31.747 --> 15:33.339
- I don't... I don't need that.

15:33.491 --> 15:38.161
- Look, I know I haven't
always been the most attentive,

15:38.179 --> 15:42.273
but... but we've gotta be honest
with each other.

15:42.776 --> 15:43.849
Look, whatever
you're struggling with,

15:44.002 --> 15:45.610
Mom was not helping you
by keeping it--

15:45.853 --> 15:48.446
- Okay, you don't get
to criticize Mom right now.
- I'm not criticizing...

15:48.597 --> 15:50.281
- Not when you're banging
her nurse.

15:51.100 --> 15:53.284
- What?
- Mom just died.

15:53.403 --> 15:56.120
And you think, you think...
I'm the one that's messed up?

15:56.272 --> 15:58.531
- Alright, alright,
that is not a...
- So what?

15:58.607 --> 16:00.291
Explain it to me then.

16:01.703 --> 16:03.944
We're being honest right now
with each other, right?

16:04.022 --> 16:05.705
What's going on?

16:05.857 --> 16:07.340
(Danny scoffs)

16:08.693 --> 16:10.301
You wanna tell him or should I?

16:11.546 --> 16:13.304
- Tell me what?

16:16.125 --> 16:17.308
- Okay.

16:17.535 --> 16:22.146
Uh, Matthew, um, both of you
sit... sit down, please.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.565
Please.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.234
Okay, uh...

16:35.903 --> 16:40.723
alright, look, uh...
this has been an enormously
challenging time.

16:40.742 --> 16:42.483
For all of us.

16:42.502 --> 16:48.339
And the last thing I want is
to make things any harder
on you boys.

16:51.827 --> 16:54.971
Alison and I are involved.

16:55.907 --> 16:57.831
- "Involved?"

16:58.259 --> 17:01.835
Look, you know how much
I loved your mother.

17:01.913 --> 17:03.579
And how much I will
always love her.

17:03.581 --> 17:04.838
But honestly,

17:05.007 --> 17:08.918
things had been difficult
long before she got sick.

17:09.345 --> 17:11.754
We were talking about
a trial separation.

17:11.773 --> 17:13.031
- Why are you telling us this?

17:13.182 --> 17:16.034
- Because I want you
to understand, Danny.

17:16.110 --> 17:18.944
Okay?
I didn't plan this.

17:19.097 --> 17:21.205
It... it just...
it happened.

17:21.357 --> 17:23.190
Okay?

17:23.710 --> 17:26.360
I don't know what else to say.

17:26.379 --> 17:29.130
- Is it serious?

17:35.764 --> 17:38.306
(dog barking)

17:42.062 --> 17:44.545
- What do we even know
about her?

17:44.564 --> 17:46.213
Honestly.

17:46.900 --> 17:49.216
- We know she rides horses.
- What?

17:49.235 --> 17:52.795
- Yeah. Or she used to
when she was a kid.

17:52.797 --> 17:53.963
- She tell you that?

17:53.965 --> 17:57.325
- I mean, at some point.

18:08.479 --> 18:11.163
- The shrimp's better than last
time, don't you think?

18:11.240 --> 18:14.425
(Matthew): Yeah.
Yeah, it's good.

18:27.348 --> 18:29.107
- Look...

18:29.943 --> 18:31.851
I know this is weird.

18:32.003 --> 18:33.502
I mean, I do.

18:34.522 --> 18:38.674
But for what it's worth,
I'm keeping my apartment
for now.

18:38.693 --> 18:40.493
In case it doesn't work out.

18:41.696 --> 18:43.996
I'm hoping that it does.

18:46.108 --> 18:48.701
Also, I've been talking
to your dad, um...

18:48.853 --> 18:52.505
about maybe helping out
with dinners, if that's okay.

18:53.949 --> 18:56.783
I know this sounds corny
but...

18:56.861 --> 19:01.030
in my line of work, I spend
a lot of time with families.

19:02.033 --> 19:05.459
But I've never really been
a part of one.

19:05.478 --> 19:06.477
So it just...

19:07.372 --> 19:11.374
it means a lot sitting here
with you guys.

19:11.893 --> 19:15.711
So if you have
any favorite dishes

19:15.730 --> 19:19.031
or anything that you hate.

19:19.884 --> 19:23.077
- Doesn't she work nights?

19:27.058 --> 19:31.252
- Actually, I've asked Alison
to take a break for now.

19:33.414 --> 19:34.730
- Hmm.

19:34.732 --> 19:37.550
- She can always go back.

20:04.853 --> 20:08.247
(chilling music)

20:18.276 --> 20:20.701
- Wait, she's living
with you guys?
- Yep.

20:20.720 --> 20:24.129
- And somehow I'm the one
seeing a shrink twice a week.
- Jeez.

20:24.282 --> 20:27.116
- And my brother says I'm
being a dick 'cause I won't bend
over backwards

20:27.134 --> 20:30.469
to be nice to her. But like
what am I supposed to say?

20:30.546 --> 20:31.637
It's sick.
- Yeah.

20:31.714 --> 20:32.972
- And I know she's not like
forcing him.

20:33.066 --> 20:35.566
Like, I get it, she's hot,
whatever, but it's like...

20:36.461 --> 20:39.144
her job is to help people die.

20:39.221 --> 20:42.448
And now she's boning
the grieving husband?
It just doesn't ...

20:45.561 --> 20:46.893
Sorry.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.988
Sorry, we can...

20:49.865 --> 20:52.124
we can talk
about something else.

20:53.327 --> 20:56.645
- Hey, do you think
we can climb this tree?

20:56.664 --> 21:00.258
Like, maybe if you helped me up?

21:02.487 --> 21:03.744
What?

21:03.763 --> 21:06.672
- There's no way it didn't start
before my mom died.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.083
I was there.
I saw it right in front of me.

21:10.161 --> 21:12.085
I saw what she was doing.

21:12.163 --> 21:14.663
And I'm supposed to just, what?

21:14.665 --> 21:15.940
Like forget it happened?

21:16.017 --> 21:18.484
Pretend we're the freaking
Brady Bunch or something?

21:21.781 --> 21:25.324
- This may not help but...

21:28.103 --> 21:30.103
...grief messes with people.

21:30.181 --> 21:35.534
Maybe your dad is struggling
more than you realize?

21:35.686 --> 21:40.631
And you trying to punish
this woman is... is gonna
make you crazy.

21:41.634 --> 21:44.593
I dunno, cut her some slack?

21:45.863 --> 21:48.306
For your own sake?

21:52.887 --> 21:56.147
- Did you dad say how long
he was going to be on his call?

21:56.298 --> 21:59.191
- No. He said just to start
without him.

22:06.567 --> 22:09.385
- This is, um,

22:09.403 --> 22:11.120
it's good.

22:11.814 --> 22:14.123
- I'm glad.

22:15.001 --> 22:17.543
- Do you still ride horses?

22:19.063 --> 22:23.341
Matthew told me
that you used to.

22:27.088 --> 22:29.254
- My dad was a rancher.

22:29.407 --> 22:33.184
We had an old farm
in Otter Creek, Nebraska.

22:33.260 --> 22:35.394
Until I was eight.

22:37.598 --> 22:38.689
- Then what?

22:39.100 --> 22:42.509
- And then he had an accident.

22:42.587 --> 22:45.846
Um, which meant
he couldn't work.

22:45.865 --> 22:47.681
- What happened?

22:47.700 --> 22:50.117
- A tractor overturned.

22:51.262 --> 22:54.096
He got pinned underneath and...

22:54.523 --> 22:58.283
long story short,
he started drinking, and
the farm got repossessed.

22:59.027 --> 23:02.088
- And what about your mom?

23:04.199 --> 23:07.218
- She wasn't in the picture.

23:09.872 --> 23:11.889
What doesn't kill ya, right?

23:11.966 --> 23:15.451
(dog barking)

23:15.453 --> 23:16.877
Is he okay?

23:16.879 --> 23:19.397
- Yeah.
He wants to go on his walk.

23:19.548 --> 23:20.881
I'll do it.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.716
- Actually, no.
No, you sit.

23:22.793 --> 23:24.460
I can take him out.

23:24.979 --> 23:30.116
If your... if your Dad comes
down, tell him he might wanna
heat up his food, okay?

23:39.401 --> 23:42.086
- No, it's done.
We're closing at 3:50.

23:42.163 --> 23:44.422
I'll call you first thing.
Okay, bye.

23:44.498 --> 23:47.316
- Guys, I am so sorry.
Uh, really.

23:47.334 --> 23:49.760
- It's okay.
- It's alright.
- Where's Alison?

23:49.837 --> 23:51.320
- She's walking Chester.

23:51.413 --> 23:54.265
- How was uh... dinner?
- It's great.

23:54.416 --> 23:55.340
- Yeah.

23:55.660 --> 23:58.227
- Yeah, it was good.
Should heat yours up.

23:59.588 --> 24:00.587
- Great.

24:00.606 --> 24:02.498
Oh! Oomph...

24:02.500 --> 24:03.757
- What's wrong?

24:03.834 --> 24:05.425
- Ah!

24:06.504 --> 24:08.779
- I just had like a stomach
cramp or something.

24:08.931 --> 24:11.323
- Guys?!
I need help!

24:12.693 --> 24:15.511
Oh!
(father): Oh, my God.

24:15.529 --> 24:17.621
Matthew, stay there.

24:17.698 --> 24:19.331
Stay there.
- Oh, my God!

24:20.626 --> 24:22.184
- We were crossing the street.

24:22.186 --> 24:24.369
Then this car swung around
and it ran the stop sign.

24:24.522 --> 24:25.871
He came out of nowhere.

24:25.965 --> 24:28.691
And I swear he was on his leash.
He was...
- Shh. It's okay.

24:28.709 --> 24:32.452
- We were halfway
down the block. And the guy
had to be going 60.

24:32.472 --> 24:35.698
- It's okay.
- Can you check his pulse
or do something?

24:35.716 --> 24:36.957
- I'm so sorry.

24:37.034 --> 24:39.602
I'm so sorry...
- You're lying.

24:41.038 --> 24:42.871
You hated Chester.

24:42.890 --> 24:43.889
-Danny.

24:43.966 --> 24:45.816
You did this.

24:45.968 --> 24:47.376
You killed him.

24:47.378 --> 24:49.135
- Alright, that's enough.
- Like you killed my mom.

24:49.155 --> 24:51.489
- Danny, no.
- Shut up!

24:51.598 --> 24:52.490
- Danny.
- Shut up!

24:52.641 --> 24:55.493
- Danny, Danny.
(grunts painfully)

24:55.611 --> 24:57.203
Ahhhh!

24:59.907 --> 25:02.041
Aargh!

25:04.729 --> 25:07.463
(sirens wailing)

25:09.157 --> 25:12.067
(indistinct PA announcement)

25:12.494 --> 25:16.388
<i> Dr. Roberts, please come</i>
<i> to oncology.</i>

25:22.079 --> 25:24.838
Okay. Uh...

25:24.857 --> 25:28.859
all your bloodwork
came back normal.

25:28.936 --> 25:32.087
- Okay, then...
what's wrong with me?

25:32.106 --> 25:36.775
- They're not exactly sure.
Uh, maybe uh...
some kind of bug.

25:36.869 --> 25:39.762
We can go home, Danny.

25:39.855 --> 25:41.187
You're okay.

25:41.265 --> 25:44.250
Physically there...
there is nothing wrong.

25:49.031 --> 25:50.956
- Do you think I made it
this up?

25:51.033 --> 25:52.383
- Uh, no.
That's not what I'm saying.

25:52.534 --> 25:55.944
- 'Cause this was like a knife
in my insides.

25:55.946 --> 25:57.537
It was real.

25:57.557 --> 25:59.372
- Okay, look, I know it...
I know it felt real.

25:59.450 --> 26:01.133
What the hell is that supposed
to mean? It felt real?

26:01.285 --> 26:03.561
- Danny!
- It was real.

26:03.712 --> 26:05.304
Danny...

26:06.290 --> 26:08.566
Look, what you said
about Alison.

26:09.794 --> 26:14.313
I mean, accusing her
of hurting Chester and Mom?

26:15.299 --> 26:18.450
I mean, do you actually
believe that?

26:22.064 --> 26:23.914
- Are you worried about Alison?

26:23.991 --> 26:26.232
- No, I'm worried about you.

26:26.252 --> 26:28.752
You... you went somewhere.
I saw it.

26:28.829 --> 26:33.340
- Well yeah, I was upset, okay?
- I'm not asking you
to apologize.

26:34.260 --> 26:37.169
I am asking you to let me in.

26:37.263 --> 26:39.746
Alright, look,
your teachers are concerned,

26:39.824 --> 26:42.916
you... you... you got symptoms
the doctors don't understand.

26:42.993 --> 26:45.644
And... and now
this wild allegation.

26:47.331 --> 26:50.733
I can't help wondering
if it's all related.

26:54.004 --> 26:55.613
- Related how?

26:56.523 --> 26:58.115
What?
- Okay, alright, just...

26:58.342 --> 27:01.309
- What are you not saying?
Just say it.
- Alright. Alright, Danny.

27:02.346 --> 27:06.332
Do you remember
Mom's brother, Julian.

27:08.794 --> 27:09.960
- The one who drowned?

27:10.037 --> 27:12.521
- Well, he didn't just drown.
He...

27:13.281 --> 27:16.024
it wasn't exactly an accident.
Um...

27:17.544 --> 27:23.365
He believed that there were
uh... spirits trapped
inside his body

27:23.384 --> 27:28.095
and that he could exorcise them
with some kind of...

27:28.964 --> 27:33.359
...self-baptism.
I don't know.

27:36.714 --> 27:39.231
He was schizophrenic, Danny.

27:40.067 --> 27:44.620
I mean,
have you ever heard voices?

27:48.150 --> 27:50.167
Okay, look, look, look, look.

27:50.318 --> 27:53.170
We will figure this out, okay?

27:53.989 --> 27:56.915
We'll talk to Dr. Shapiro.

27:56.992 --> 28:00.427
We'll get you the help you need.
I promise.

28:01.088 --> 28:03.739
It's gonna be okay.

28:03.757 --> 28:06.141
It's gonna be
okay.

28:21.091 --> 28:23.200
(muffled conversation)

28:24.370 --> 28:27.246
(Alison): Listen, there's a lot
we don't know.

28:28.615 --> 28:32.284
Don't pathologize him.
He has a really good heart.

28:32.436 --> 28:33.785
Think about
what he's been through.

28:33.862 --> 28:35.954
- You don't understand.
I know my son.
This isn't Danny.

28:36.048 --> 28:40.108
- Okay, listen to me. Even if
you're right, there are plenty
of treatments and medications.

28:40.127 --> 28:43.111
- To manage it,
but there's no cure.

28:43.964 --> 28:46.631
I can't just watch him
slip away. I can't.

28:47.284 --> 28:49.059
What if it gets worse?

28:49.286 --> 28:52.396
What if this is
the rest of his life?

28:53.640 --> 28:55.607
(somber music)

29:04.577 --> 29:06.301
(knocking on door)

29:06.320 --> 29:09.246
(Alison): Hey.
Can I come in?

29:10.899 --> 29:12.641
- Uh...

29:12.659 --> 29:14.626
Yeah. Okay.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.426
Did you get some sleep?

29:26.840 --> 29:29.082
I made you some oatmeal.

29:29.159 --> 29:32.511
Um... it's got ginger, nutmeg.

29:32.663 --> 29:36.089
A little turmeric powder
which is really good
for digestion

29:36.166 --> 29:38.016
and flushing things out.

29:38.168 --> 29:40.360
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

29:41.522 --> 29:42.696
Here.

29:43.616 --> 29:45.365
- I, um...

29:46.176 --> 29:48.160
I'm sorry...

29:49.196 --> 29:51.789
about last night.
- Yeah.

29:51.940 --> 29:53.665
Um...

29:54.535 --> 29:56.293
I'm sorry too.

29:57.204 --> 30:00.856
I know that you're dealing
with so much right now.

30:00.858 --> 30:03.449
And I also know

30:03.527 --> 30:07.120
that I'm probably
the last person you wanna
talk to,

30:07.197 --> 30:08.713
but I'm here.

30:08.790 --> 30:10.048
I mean, if you could use

30:10.200 --> 30:14.228
someone other than your dad
to talk things through?

30:15.873 --> 30:17.648
(exhales)

30:20.727 --> 30:22.653
I hope you like it.

31:12.946 --> 31:15.372
- Hey, Leanna?

31:21.271 --> 31:22.938
It was great.
Thanks.

31:22.940 --> 31:25.632
- Yeah?
Where you going?

31:29.054 --> 31:32.114
- Uh, I'm just meeting a friend.

31:32.132 --> 31:34.391
- Oh. Who? Leanna?

31:34.542 --> 31:37.377
Matthew said something
about a girlfriend.

31:37.396 --> 31:39.897
- It's probably not like that.
We're just hangin' out.

31:40.048 --> 31:41.306
- That's cool.

31:41.308 --> 31:42.974
- Okay.
Well, I should really...

31:43.127 --> 31:44.960
- Well, hey. Your bag.

31:44.978 --> 31:46.236
It's leaking.

31:46.388 --> 31:48.405
- Oh. It's just my water bottle.
It's really nothing.

31:48.482 --> 31:50.556
- Well, it's dripping
on the floor.
Let me get a towel.

31:50.576 --> 31:53.135
- No, it's okay.
Seriously, it's fine.
- Let me dry it for you.

31:53.137 --> 31:54.819
- It's fine. Stop.

31:54.896 --> 31:56.914
I gotta go or I'm gonna be late.

31:56.990 --> 31:59.416
I'll see you later, okay?

32:06.408 --> 32:09.075
(Leanna): You think
she's drugging you?

32:09.127 --> 32:10.761
I thought the doctors
didn't find anything.

32:10.912 --> 32:12.429
- It was routine blood work.

32:12.580 --> 32:15.081
She'd know
what they would screen for
and what they wouldn't.

32:15.159 --> 32:18.584
There was a woman in Texas
who killed her husband
using antifreeze.

32:18.604 --> 32:21.179
She used the smallest dosage
so that it couldn't be detected.

32:21.331 --> 32:22.606
- Okay, but--
- Think about it.

32:22.833 --> 32:26.276
No one thought my mom was gonna
deteriorate that quickly.

32:26.428 --> 32:28.278
Alison was in charge
of her meds.

32:28.505 --> 32:31.690
I dunno, maybe she got impatient
waiting for her to die

32:31.766 --> 32:34.934
and now she knows I'm onto her
and now she's coming after me.

32:34.954 --> 32:36.769
- I don't know.
- Listen. Listen to me.

32:36.789 --> 32:39.181
I found a lab in Westbury, okay?

32:39.199 --> 32:41.941
They can do a full analysis
for $300

32:42.019 --> 32:43.627
but I need you
to put it on your card.

32:43.704 --> 32:47.022
I can give you the money.
- I don't...
I don't have a card.

32:47.115 --> 32:48.707
- That's okay I can give you
the cash,

32:48.859 --> 32:50.283
but it has to be under your name

32:50.302 --> 32:51.693
so that it doesn't get
traced back...

32:51.786 --> 32:55.430
- Danny, have you brought
this up with your therapist?

32:57.718 --> 32:59.718
- I know...

32:59.870 --> 33:01.520
this sounds crazy,

33:03.131 --> 33:05.373
but that's why I need proof.

33:06.134 --> 33:07.892
I'll pay you back
and get you the money.

33:07.969 --> 33:09.227
- It's not that.
- What, what is it?

33:09.379 --> 33:11.880
- You don't believe me?
- I don't know.

33:11.898 --> 33:13.323
It... it doesn't really
make sense.

33:13.475 --> 33:15.217
Why would this woman
want to hurt you?

33:15.219 --> 33:16.827
- Because she's crazy!

33:16.903 --> 33:19.312
She's messed up!
She's evil! That's why.

33:19.331 --> 33:20.998
- Danny.
- I... Look, the proof is
right here.

33:21.074 --> 33:22.073
I need you to take it.

33:22.167 --> 33:24.668
Take it!
- No, I'm not, I'm not. Stop!

33:24.745 --> 33:26.061
(clattering)

33:26.063 --> 33:27.746
- What is the matter with you?

33:28.582 --> 33:30.990
What are you doing?
I can't risk contamination.

33:31.084 --> 33:32.734
I have to get
as much as possible.

33:32.753 --> 33:34.586
Because if there's not enough
saturation

33:34.738 --> 33:37.514
and I don't have enough oatmeal,
they won't have enough
to detect anything.

33:37.591 --> 33:40.666
- Um, you're starting to scare
me and I think you need help.

33:40.686 --> 33:42.394
- I'm asking for help!

33:43.188 --> 33:46.273
That's what I'm asking for!

33:50.011 --> 33:52.154
Are you gonna help me?

33:52.939 --> 33:54.589
- Danny, I'm--
- What!

33:54.591 --> 33:57.659
- Sorry, I, I can't.

34:12.051 --> 34:13.717
- Oh my God.

34:14.294 --> 34:16.553
Alison, this is fantastic.

34:16.704 --> 34:18.780
Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

34:18.782 --> 34:20.115
- Hey, you're not hungry?

34:20.133 --> 34:22.517
Oh, come on.
You gotta eat.

34:27.124 --> 34:29.649
- Can we switch?

34:32.629 --> 34:35.888
There's uh... too much fat
on the end.

34:35.966 --> 34:37.390
You know I don't like fat.

34:37.467 --> 34:39.392
- Okay, yeah.
Yeah, I don't mind.

34:39.469 --> 34:40.985
- But I made yours medium well.

34:41.062 --> 34:43.080
Just how you like it.
- I like it both ways.

34:43.231 --> 34:44.823
- Well, he likes his rare.

34:44.899 --> 34:46.232
- He just said
it doesn't matter.

34:46.310 --> 34:47.417
Forget it. It... it's fine.

34:47.494 --> 34:49.494
- No. It's not fine.
- What's the big deal?

34:49.571 --> 34:52.923
- I'm sorry, okay,
but I am really trying.

34:52.999 --> 34:55.483
But honestly I can't keep
doing this. I can't.

34:55.502 --> 34:57.485
- Can keep doing what?
- Guys, I don't want
an argument.

34:57.504 --> 35:00.338
- Fine. I will just go eat
in my room.

35:00.415 --> 35:03.916
- No, you'll eat here.
You're a member of this family.

35:03.994 --> 35:06.085
Hey, what are you doing?
Danny.

35:06.163 --> 35:07.829
What are you doing?
- Collecting evidence.

35:07.831 --> 35:11.757
- Of what?
- Of whatever she's using
to poison me!

35:11.777 --> 35:13.001
- She's not! I promise.

35:13.003 --> 35:14.427
Danny.
Danny.

35:14.446 --> 35:16.929
Stop. Look at me! Stop!
- Let me go!

35:16.949 --> 35:19.007
(clattering)

35:19.025 --> 35:21.701
- Look, I am trying
to help you.

35:22.896 --> 35:24.195
Alright.
- Stay back!

35:24.348 --> 35:26.123
- Danny, put the knife down.
Look at me.

35:26.199 --> 35:27.940
<i> - 9-1-1?</i>
(Alison): Hi, uh?

35:27.960 --> 35:30.685
A young man.
My boyfriend's son.
- No one is trying to hurt you.

35:30.687 --> 35:32.612
He's having some kind
of episode.
- Danny, put the knife down.

35:32.631 --> 35:36.040
- Please, he has a knife.
- Come with me, tonight.

35:36.193 --> 35:39.043
- Danny, she's not trying
to poison you.

35:39.120 --> 35:41.196
- Yes, she is.
How do you not see it?

35:41.198 --> 35:42.973
She's a killer.

35:43.124 --> 35:44.975
First Mom, then Chester,

35:45.126 --> 35:48.127
then me, then you, then you.

35:48.147 --> 35:50.705
And I'm gonna prove it.
- Danny!

35:50.724 --> 35:52.607
Wait here.

36:09.726 --> 36:11.317
Danny!
Open the door.

36:11.395 --> 36:14.746
Danny, please.
Danny, what are you doing?

36:14.898 --> 36:16.398
Open the door, you hear me?

36:16.400 --> 36:18.842
- The police are on their way.
He could hurt himself.

36:18.993 --> 36:20.677
- Did you tell them he's a kid?

36:20.754 --> 36:22.012
- Yeah.
- Danny!

36:22.163 --> 36:24.072
Answer me!

36:24.090 --> 36:26.408
Please.
Open the door.

36:26.410 --> 36:29.669
- Just wait for them
to get here. What are you doing?

36:29.688 --> 36:31.095
(grunts forcefully)

36:31.172 --> 36:33.857
- Stay back. It's here.
I know it is.

36:33.934 --> 36:35.192
- It's okay, Danny.

36:35.268 --> 36:37.602
- No, it's not!
Stop saying that.

36:37.754 --> 36:39.921
- Okay, look.
The police are coming, alright?

36:39.940 --> 36:42.273
We'll let them investigate, huh?

36:42.426 --> 36:46.261
Look, if there's poison,
they will find it.

36:46.279 --> 36:49.206
Okay? Please, you gotta put
the knife down.

36:49.357 --> 36:50.707
Just look at me, Danny.

36:51.435 --> 36:53.768
(Danny sobbing)
You have to put the knife down.

36:53.787 --> 36:55.787
Please Danny, look at me.

36:55.863 --> 36:58.215
I can feel Mom here.
Can't you?

36:58.366 --> 37:01.593
- No!
- She doesn't want this
for you, Danny.

37:02.796 --> 37:04.704
She wants you happy.

37:04.723 --> 37:06.556
(sobbing)

37:07.784 --> 37:09.041
Put it down.

37:09.061 --> 37:11.561
(Danny shouting,
Alison screaming in fear)

37:11.638 --> 37:12.954
- Alison!

37:12.956 --> 37:14.472
No, no, no, no.

37:15.308 --> 37:17.976
- Drop the knife!
Drop it. Drop it now!

37:18.128 --> 37:20.070
275, arrived, dispatch code...

37:20.297 --> 37:21.738
Advise stabbing victim.

37:23.967 --> 37:26.910
- Alison... stay with me, huh?

37:26.987 --> 37:29.729
Alison...

37:29.748 --> 37:31.539
No, no, no, no.

37:34.661 --> 37:36.144
- Danny, listen to me.

37:36.146 --> 37:37.754
I'm on your side here.

37:37.905 --> 37:41.499
But there is no way
I'm going to let you stand
in front of a jury

37:41.593 --> 37:45.244
and try to claim that this
woman was trying to poison you.

37:45.264 --> 37:48.265
No one is going to believe that.
You will lose.

37:48.341 --> 37:51.584
You will go to prison.
For a long time.

37:51.603 --> 37:54.178
The only way I can keep that
from happening

37:54.255 --> 37:57.181
is to convince the judge
you're unfit to stand trial.

37:57.258 --> 38:01.185
So either you submit to
a psych evaluation, voluntarily,

38:01.338 --> 38:03.929
or there will be
a competency hearing.

38:04.357 --> 38:08.267
And I will be forced
to call every possible witness

38:08.287 --> 38:12.530
who can describe
just how sick you are.

38:12.682 --> 38:13.848
Your father.

38:13.867 --> 38:15.941
Your teachers.
Your friends.

38:16.019 --> 38:17.276
It will be ugly.

38:17.354 --> 38:20.188
It will be invasive
for your whole family.

38:20.799 --> 38:24.634
And you don't just have
to take my word for it.
(buzzer sound)

38:24.861 --> 38:26.344
(door opening)

38:30.958 --> 38:32.550
- Hey.

38:32.702 --> 38:34.269
- Hey.

38:35.038 --> 38:37.063
- Danny...

38:40.560 --> 38:43.403
No one wants to see you
get hurt.

38:44.823 --> 38:46.656
They don't.

38:49.477 --> 38:51.477
But if you don't change your
mind,

38:51.555 --> 38:56.458
I have to go up there
and I have to tell everyone
that you're crazy.

38:57.911 --> 39:00.545
I don't wanna do that to you.

39:02.732 --> 39:04.566
I don't.

39:04.584 --> 39:06.718
I can't.

39:59.380 --> 40:02.290
- I understand the defendant
has agreed to submit

40:02.383 --> 40:04.142
to a voluntary
psychiatric evaluation.

40:04.294 --> 40:05.885
- Yes, Your Honor.

40:06.053 --> 40:10.314
- In that case, we'll delay
trial proceedings
pending those results.

40:10.467 --> 40:12.650
Any objection from the State?

40:12.802 --> 40:14.077
- No, Your Honor.

40:14.228 --> 40:16.746
- Good.
We're adjourned.

40:48.763 --> 40:50.655
- Hey, kid.

40:52.342 --> 40:54.492
You've got a visitor.

41:00.033 --> 41:02.000
- Hi, Danny.

41:13.638 --> 41:15.472
Long time.

41:17.124 --> 41:18.975
You look good.

41:19.719 --> 41:21.394
Healthy.

41:25.208 --> 41:28.651
I hope you know I'm not angry.

41:29.637 --> 41:32.655
I know that it wasn't you.

41:32.807 --> 41:34.991
It was your illness.

41:36.143 --> 41:38.620
And I've made a full recovery.

41:39.146 --> 41:41.389
(She sighs)

41:42.726 --> 41:47.337
Danny, I'm so sorry to be
the one to share this with you.

41:48.231 --> 41:52.008
Your father, he passed away.

41:53.327 --> 41:55.970
Right after our honeymoon.

41:58.165 --> 42:01.392
A heart attack, most likely.

42:02.746 --> 42:05.747
It was sudden but peaceful.

42:05.765 --> 42:07.649
In his sleep.

42:09.361 --> 42:10.935
Oh, Danny.

42:11.029 --> 42:13.604
We're gonna get through this.

42:13.757 --> 42:15.014
Hmm?

42:15.033 --> 42:17.182
You and me.

42:17.202 --> 42:18.868
It'll bring us closer.

42:19.020 --> 42:20.352
Promise.

42:20.430 --> 42:22.497
- Where's...

42:24.392 --> 42:26.000
Matthew?

42:27.028 --> 42:29.403
I... I need to see him.

42:30.215 --> 42:33.107
- I'm afraid
that's not possible.

42:33.109 --> 42:35.777
He hasn't been feeling well.

42:35.779 --> 42:37.779
Stomach pains.

42:38.448 --> 42:43.951
- Bring me my brother,
you bitch.

42:43.953 --> 42:45.787
Hey! Stop!

42:45.789 --> 42:48.623
- Aargh!
I need to talk to my brother.
- Calm down.

42:48.625 --> 42:51.292
- I, I, I don't know
what happened.
He just went off for no reason.

42:51.294 --> 42:52.627
- Stop!
Don't listen to her.

42:52.645 --> 42:55.572
She's lying. I need
to see my brother. I need to.

42:55.648 --> 42:59.075
- Please, whatever help
he needs, make sure he gets it.

42:59.226 --> 43:02.412
- Please don't listen to her.
(groaning)

43:03.990 --> 43:05.973
- Don't worry, Danny.

43:05.992 --> 43:07.475
You're safe here.

43:07.493 --> 43:09.268
I'm not giving up.

43:09.345 --> 43:11.979
I'll never give up.
(Danny moaning)

43:11.998 --> 43:15.049
No matter how long it takes.

43:16.761 --> 43:19.304
(chilling music)
