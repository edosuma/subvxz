00:05.922 --> 00:07.007
<i>Police are on the lookout</i>

00:07.090 --> 00:08.842
<i>for a couple masquerading</i>
<i>as party goers</i>

00:08.925 --> 00:12.554
<i>who robbed the attendees at an event</i>
<i>in an upscale enclave of Oaks Bluff.</i>

00:12.637 --> 00:15.015
<i>No one was harmed, but the couple</i>
<i>appears to have absconded</i>

00:15.098 --> 00:17.434
<i>with several hundred thousand</i>
<i>dollars in jewels and cash.</i>

00:17.517 --> 00:18.518
We're getting famous.

00:18.601 --> 00:21.646
You know the one they stole
from Kim K looked just like this.

00:22.605 --> 00:25.442
But these bracelets are way nicer
than her Cartiers.

00:25.525 --> 00:26.526
Hey, Bling Ring.

00:26.901 --> 00:28.028
How about you stop admiring the loot

00:28.111 --> 00:29.696
and start paying attention to me, huh?

00:29.779 --> 00:32.073
I'm the one who got the shiner
making our getaway.

00:32.157 --> 00:34.701
That's because
you're too slow, Chuckster.

00:34.784 --> 00:36.202
Always underestimating how much

00:36.286 --> 00:38.038
rich people like holding
on to their stuff.

00:39.748 --> 00:40.957
What's this?

00:42.375 --> 00:44.419
Rich people's ball tomorrow night.

00:44.502 --> 00:46.087
Could be another big score.

00:58.641 --> 01:00.143
You're a real idiot.

01:06.524 --> 01:07.525
Hey.

01:07.984 --> 01:10.570
Come around and help me out,
Pamela. Door's jammed.

01:10.653 --> 01:12.947
What the hell did you
almost crash us into?

01:35.512 --> 01:37.806
Marshmallow roses. So good!

01:37.889 --> 01:40.058
You should save one of these
for J'onn, you know.

01:40.141 --> 01:42.852
What? This one's for me.
You want one? They're delicious.

01:43.978 --> 01:44.979
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:45.063 --> 01:47.440
-Happy Valentine's Day.
-Thank you so much.

01:47.524 --> 01:50.193
Oh, my gosh, this place is awesome!

01:50.443 --> 01:53.655
I can't believe it's taken you weeks
to finally have me over.

01:54.739 --> 01:57.659
Well, I just wanted to get the place
fully set up before you saw it.

01:57.742 --> 01:59.953
I am so proud of you.

02:00.036 --> 02:03.123
And I see we're not the only ones
who gave you a Valentine's gift.

02:03.206 --> 02:05.750
No, most of these are from
the aliens in my support group,

02:05.834 --> 02:08.169
but this box is from members of
a crime watch I helped set up

02:08.253 --> 02:09.963
to catch taggers
who were spray painting,

02:10.046 --> 02:12.173
"Free Ben Lockwood"
up and down the block.

02:12.257 --> 02:15.844
These flowers are from a Toomian
whose lost family I found.

02:16.344 --> 02:20.765
Well, it is amazing how many clients
you've already helped.

02:21.766 --> 02:26.479
I mean, you left the DEO with a goal
to change your life and you have.

02:26.771 --> 02:30.567
I sense discontent in your voice.
How are things with Haley? Better?

02:30.650 --> 02:33.903
Um, she's been in Washington.
So that's good, I guess.

02:33.987 --> 02:37.198
It's just seeing how much
you've accomplished.

02:37.282 --> 02:40.952
It reminds me of how little I've done
since I took over the DEO.

02:41.035 --> 02:43.413
You have not done little.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.790
Mercy and Otis Graves. Agent Liberty.

02:45.874 --> 02:47.625
I mean in my personal life.

02:47.709 --> 02:50.003
Yeah, I took over the DEO
to use that stability

02:50.086 --> 02:52.839
to finally be able to pursue
the things that I want

02:52.922 --> 02:56.718
and I did, you know, at first,
and I dated a lot.

02:56.801 --> 02:58.678
-Oh, we know.
-Yeah.

02:58.761 --> 03:00.722
Well, you know,
and I was also working

03:00.805 --> 03:02.974
on my adoption portfolio,

03:03.057 --> 03:06.561
but, you know, when
President Marsdin got exposed,

03:06.644 --> 03:09.355
it kinda all just fell
to the wayside.

03:09.439 --> 03:10.690
It's weird

03:10.773 --> 03:15.945
because I feel like I have this
capacity for so much more lately,

03:16.946 --> 03:18.698
and I'm doing nothing.

03:23.703 --> 03:24.704
Thank you.

03:24.787 --> 03:27.081
Well, if you feel like
getting back out there,

03:27.165 --> 03:28.791
I know Nia and her roommate
are throwing

03:28.875 --> 03:32.295
a very happening
Valentine's party tonight.

03:32.378 --> 03:35.131
We could go together.
I could be your wing-woman.

03:35.715 --> 03:37.175
Why does that scare me?

03:37.508 --> 03:38.593
-Hold on.

03:39.594 --> 03:41.221
Well, police found a car

03:41.304 --> 03:43.890
that apparently crashed
trying to avoid an asteroid.

03:44.182 --> 03:46.392
-So, I'm gonna go.
-Yeah.

03:46.726 --> 03:49.062
-Good to see you.
-Yeah, you too.

03:49.646 --> 03:51.773
-I love you both.
-Love you.

03:58.363 --> 04:00.156
Now, you're looking discontent.

04:01.449 --> 04:03.034
I just miss her,

04:03.576 --> 04:05.328
being her partner in crime.

04:10.416 --> 04:11.584
Thank you.

04:12.710 --> 04:15.880
And now, I need to get out of here
before I eat all your Valentines.

04:19.384 --> 04:20.718
Excuse me, go ahead.

04:21.678 --> 04:24.305
Mrs. Stuart,
glad you found the place.

04:24.597 --> 04:26.266
-Please, have a seat.
-Thank you.

04:27.850 --> 04:30.061
So, uh, how can I help you today?

04:30.144 --> 04:31.938
I didn't know who else to call.

04:32.563 --> 04:34.315
I think my husband's been kidnapped.

04:37.902 --> 04:39.445
-Brainy?
-It is I

04:39.529 --> 04:42.699
and I'd like to make myself clear
since I did not last time.

04:42.865 --> 04:45.743
I am not here for a date.

04:45.827 --> 04:47.704
Happy Valentine's Day to you, too.

04:48.037 --> 04:50.665
I sense sarcasm, which I find
confusing in this context.

04:50.748 --> 04:53.584
You see, I'm here because Kara
told me about your mother's passing,

04:53.668 --> 04:56.921
which I was very sorry to hear.

04:58.631 --> 05:00.800
But having run simulations,

05:00.883 --> 05:04.178
I've deduced that there is an 87.4%
chance that you would now

05:04.262 --> 05:06.389
wish to train as a superhero.

05:06.472 --> 05:08.933
And I have brought my most complex
mind mazes to help you

05:09.017 --> 05:11.394
hone your skills
and interpret your dreams.

05:12.061 --> 05:13.062
Brainy,

05:13.479 --> 05:16.107
I know it's my destiny
to have these powers,

05:16.399 --> 05:18.318
but I'm still grieving, Brainy.

05:18.776 --> 05:20.570
My mother passed away so suddenly.

05:22.613 --> 05:26.326
Have you ever considered putting
your grief into tiny boxes?

05:27.076 --> 05:29.078
That doesn't sound very healthy.

05:29.579 --> 05:30.580
It could be.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.333
Besides they would
free you up to train

05:33.416 --> 05:36.002
and join mine and Supergirl's
crime-fighting family.

05:36.711 --> 05:40.131
I would love to join
your family someday.

05:41.299 --> 05:43.593
But I'm just not ready
to train right now.

05:46.554 --> 05:49.182
Very well. I shall take
my mind mazes and go.

05:50.975 --> 05:53.269
Brainy! Brainy.

05:53.770 --> 05:56.773
My roommate Yvette's
having a Valentine's party

05:56.856 --> 05:58.733
tonight to try to cheer me up.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.359
If you wanna come?

06:01.611 --> 06:03.071
Actually, I would...

06:03.154 --> 06:04.572
I would love to attend.

06:04.822 --> 06:06.157
Great.

06:06.991 --> 06:08.534
Then it's a date.

06:17.418 --> 06:19.504
Don't look so troubled, son.

06:19.587 --> 06:20.797
Why not?

06:21.089 --> 06:22.965
You're locked up
and you're the only one

06:23.049 --> 06:25.384
who's brave enough
to stand up for humanity.

06:26.511 --> 06:27.512
It isn't right.

06:27.595 --> 06:29.514
Listen, the movement
that was created,

06:29.597 --> 06:31.808
I have to believe

06:32.558 --> 06:35.311
will create the circumstances
of my release.

06:35.394 --> 06:38.940
But I wanna do something for you now.

06:39.023 --> 06:40.441
Then be a man.

06:42.902 --> 06:44.403
A man of action.

06:44.487 --> 06:47.281
Be the man that your grandfather

06:47.490 --> 06:50.535
-wanted me to be, but at your age.

06:51.202 --> 06:53.204
<i>Visiting hours are now over.</i>

06:54.163 --> 06:55.164
We should go.

06:56.958 --> 06:58.251
See you next week.

07:02.130 --> 07:04.757
Hey, George, come here.

07:05.591 --> 07:06.592
Um...

07:15.435 --> 07:18.146
Colonel Haley, I didn't expect
to see you so soon.

07:18.229 --> 07:20.148
Yeah, well, I came back early
to help my daughter.

07:20.231 --> 07:22.400
-You have a daughter?
-Don't look so surprised, Director.

07:22.483 --> 07:24.694
I do have a life outside the service.

07:24.902 --> 07:26.529
She was having trouble
on a school project,

07:26.612 --> 07:28.030
so I came back to help her.

07:28.823 --> 07:30.908
You'd be impressed by what
I can do with a glue gun.

07:31.784 --> 07:34.454
It must have been nice for her
to have some time with her mom.

07:35.288 --> 07:38.374
Yeah, working with her was much more
pleasant than my time at the Oval.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.460
I take it that part
didn't go over so well.

07:40.543 --> 07:42.462
The President wanted answers
I couldn't give him

07:42.545 --> 07:44.505
about the rage drug
you dealt with the other week.

07:45.089 --> 07:48.217
He's also dismayed that Ben Lockwood
is polling better than he is.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.844
We are all dismayed by that.

07:49.927 --> 07:51.429
Ma'am, you need to see this.

07:54.056 --> 07:56.392
NORAD misidentified
this as an asteroid,

07:56.517 --> 07:58.269
but it's some type of ship.

07:58.352 --> 08:01.272
And whatever came out of it
seems to have eaten this man's heart.

08:01.731 --> 08:03.191
And nothing else.

08:06.068 --> 08:08.029
Happy Valentine's Day.

08:12.492 --> 08:16.204
It's like the creature
extracted his heart perfectly.

08:16.662 --> 08:18.789
There's minimal tissue damage,
there's no blood loss.

08:18.873 --> 08:20.625
It's like it cauterized itself.

08:20.708 --> 08:22.251
A sophisticated killing

08:22.627 --> 08:25.254
much like its ship
which presented as solid rock.

08:25.338 --> 08:28.341
Also, what's interesting is this
creature's shed skin suggests

08:28.424 --> 08:30.843
that it underwent some sort of
metamorphosis quickly after arrival,

08:30.927 --> 08:33.054
which I do find comforting.

08:33.179 --> 08:36.307
I would much rather face that
than anything snake-like,

08:36.599 --> 08:39.769
which I do have a deep phobia about.

08:40.186 --> 08:41.437
As any rational being would.

08:41.521 --> 08:42.980
-You hate snakes?
-Yes.

08:43.064 --> 08:46.609
Much like the hero of the Spielberg
epic <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark.</i>

08:46.776 --> 08:48.569
A terrific picture.

08:48.819 --> 08:51.656
In any event, I analyzed the DNA
from the creature's skin

08:51.739 --> 08:54.242
and made a composite of what
the beast might look like now.

08:55.034 --> 08:56.994
Two more victims
were just discovered.

08:57.078 --> 08:59.747
They lived in a mansion, a mile
from where that pod landed.

08:59.872 --> 09:01.749
Same exact cause of death.

09:02.166 --> 09:03.584
We need to find
whatever killed these people

09:03.668 --> 09:05.253
before we have a panic on our hands.

09:05.336 --> 09:07.880
If my interpretation
of the data is correct,

09:08.422 --> 09:11.133
this is what we're looking for.

09:11.676 --> 09:13.052
What is it?

09:13.761 --> 09:14.971
Unknown.

09:15.513 --> 09:18.307
I've updated the President.
He wants this kept out of the press.

09:18.599 --> 09:20.268
Humans are already
feeling so vulnerable.

09:20.351 --> 09:21.352
We'll do whatever we can.

09:21.435 --> 09:23.729
I'll be back in a few hours.
Update me with any progress.

09:23.813 --> 09:24.814
Yes, ma'am.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.150
I love what you've done to the place.

09:28.234 --> 09:29.569
Looks like an actual newsroom now.

09:29.652 --> 09:32.280
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Like <i>The Washington Post.</i>

09:32.613 --> 09:34.574
So, what do I owe the surprise?

09:35.283 --> 09:37.994
Well, the lady who came
into my office as you were leaving,

09:38.202 --> 09:40.371
her husband is the Director
of Alien Affairs.

09:40.454 --> 09:41.706
You mean, Anthony Stuart?

09:41.789 --> 09:42.915
That's right, that's right.

09:42.999 --> 09:44.458
He helped draft
the Alien Amnesty Act.

09:44.542 --> 09:46.294
-Right.
-He and his wife have been getting

09:46.377 --> 09:48.379
a lot of threats ever since
Lockwood was imprisoned,

09:48.462 --> 09:50.965
and last night,
he never made it home.

09:51.048 --> 09:52.174
She thinks he was kidnapped.

09:52.258 --> 09:54.927
I imagine CatCo has a lot
of research on Stuart.

09:55.136 --> 09:57.054
I was hoping that I could
give you the scoop
and in return, you could help me
with my investigation.

09:59.140 --> 10:01.767
Whatever you need.
Sounds like it's an important story.

10:01.851 --> 10:04.061
This is something I think the DEO
might be interested in, too,

10:04.145 --> 10:07.148
and if that's the case,
per our conversation this morning,

10:07.982 --> 10:10.192
you can't work
with Alex as Supergirl,

10:10.276 --> 10:12.236
but maybe you could
team up with her on this.

10:13.779 --> 10:16.699
It's Valentine's Day,
and you're being a matchmaker.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.334
Everything okay?

10:29.045 --> 10:31.255
Now that you're here
with a very large present.

10:31.339 --> 10:34.884
I took this in our last morning
at the lake house together.

10:35.718 --> 10:37.345
Open it, please.
This is how I see you,

10:44.143 --> 10:46.479
when we're away from everything else
and it's just you and I.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.190
And it's perfect.
Let's go to Paris.

10:51.776 --> 10:53.277
-Tonight.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.613
For Valentine's weekend,
away from everything else.

10:57.114 --> 10:58.199
Are you serious?

10:58.282 --> 10:59.575
Have you ever known me to joke?
No.

11:01.160 --> 11:04.580
Uh, no, but I've never known you
to offer spontaneous trips, either.

11:05.164 --> 11:06.707
Are you sure everything's okay?

11:06.791 --> 11:08.209
James, we never just live
in the moment.

11:08.292 --> 11:09.335
You know, we should do that more.

11:09.418 --> 11:11.212
Because we never know
what tomorrow's gonna bring.

11:12.254 --> 11:13.381
Come on, all right, listen.

11:13.464 --> 11:15.007
If your billionaire girlfriend cannot

11:15.091 --> 11:16.759
whisk you away
for a romantic holiday,

11:16.842 --> 11:18.636
then there really is something
wrong with the world.

11:19.678 --> 11:21.097
The lady has a point.

11:21.180 --> 11:23.099
-The lady usually does.
-Mmm.

11:25.184 --> 11:27.144
Here's something. Fred Roberts,

11:27.228 --> 11:29.313
known member
of the Children of Liberty.

11:29.563 --> 11:33.275
He sent hate mail to Stuart after
the Alien Amnesty Act was signed.

11:33.692 --> 11:36.112
And then he was arrested
and convicted for stalking him.

11:36.195 --> 11:38.197
He was released
from prison last week.

11:38.823 --> 11:41.575
No release address listed
in the records I have access to.

11:42.159 --> 11:43.828
But I think the DEO might have it.

11:44.453 --> 11:46.455
Any luck narrowing things down?

11:46.747 --> 11:48.582
I'm working on it.

11:49.792 --> 11:52.378
Then why are you looking up
Valentine's Day gifts?

11:53.170 --> 11:56.132
I am 85% focused,

11:56.215 --> 11:59.427
which is the equivalent
to a very capable CSI team.

11:59.510 --> 12:02.680
Now, I just have one other matter
of importance to take care of

12:02.763 --> 12:04.849
and once I do, I guarantee you
100% of my mind.

12:04.932 --> 12:07.309
Unless, of course,
you'd like to help out,

12:07.393 --> 12:11.522
in which case, I could stop
multi-tasking sooner. I'm sure of it.

12:11.605 --> 12:13.441
I hate Valentine's Day.

12:16.402 --> 12:17.403
Two minutes.

12:17.653 --> 12:22.825
Today, Nia Nal invited me to attend
a Valentine's Day party.

12:22.908 --> 12:24.660
She said, "It's a date."

12:25.161 --> 12:27.246
Yet her intentions were unclear.

12:27.329 --> 12:29.707
"It's a date,"
does not sound unclear.

12:29.790 --> 12:33.711
It never occurred to me that
someone as amazing as Nia Nal

12:33.794 --> 12:36.464
would be interested in me.

12:36.839 --> 12:40.259
Then, I guess, the bigger question
here is, what do you want?

12:41.510 --> 12:44.013
I want her to be my Valentine.

12:44.263 --> 12:46.474
Well then, bring her a gift
that expresses that.

12:46.557 --> 12:47.975
What a bold idea,

12:48.058 --> 12:51.270
from a very bold person,
Alex Danvers!

12:51.353 --> 12:53.355
Ugh. If only...

12:53.564 --> 12:55.149
Here you are
in the middle of a crisis,

12:55.232 --> 12:57.067
carving out time
to figure out your life.

12:57.193 --> 12:58.194
Multi-tasking.

12:58.277 --> 12:59.820
Yes, can we get back
to the search now, please?

12:59.904 --> 13:00.905
Absolutely.

13:00.988 --> 13:03.240
In fact, I've just finished
analyzing the police reports

13:03.324 --> 13:05.117
for the two additional victims.

13:05.201 --> 13:07.661
It appears that
beyond the deaths themselves,

13:07.745 --> 13:10.206
every piece of jewelry
at their house was taken.

13:10.664 --> 13:12.958
I understand the car
where we found the first victim

13:13.042 --> 13:14.043
was involved in a jewel heist.

13:14.126 --> 13:15.961
Those jewels were also taken.

13:16.045 --> 13:17.046
Jewelry.

13:17.713 --> 13:19.173
Gems and precious metals could be

13:19.256 --> 13:21.217
an additional source
of nutrition for this alien.

13:21.300 --> 13:22.801
Or potentially, the alien requires

13:22.885 --> 13:24.303
the jewels as a resource
for its planet.

13:24.386 --> 13:27.640
In any event, it would suggest how
this alien is choosing its victims.

13:27.765 --> 13:29.642
If it's traveling on foot,
that would give us a radius

13:29.725 --> 13:30.809
and a profile of victims

13:30.893 --> 13:31.936
-for which to search by.

13:32.144 --> 13:34.104
Triangulate and send me
the addresses.

13:34.897 --> 13:36.273
Hey, J'onn, is everything okay?

13:36.357 --> 13:39.318
I have a client whose husband,
the Director of Alien Affairs,

13:39.401 --> 13:41.445
might have been the victim
of a hate crime.

13:41.820 --> 13:43.656
I could use your help tracking down

13:43.739 --> 13:45.533
a potential lead
Kara helped me come up with.

13:45.616 --> 13:47.952
I'm sorry, I've got
an unidentified alien threat

13:48.035 --> 13:49.286
that I'm trying to track.

13:49.370 --> 13:51.247
But you should call Brainy.
I'm sure he could help.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.082
He's great at multi-tasking.

13:57.628 --> 13:59.755
She re-directed me to Brainy.

13:59.838 --> 14:01.632
So much for my match-making skills.

14:01.924 --> 14:03.926
Well, the lead was bad, anyway.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.345
There was no release address
for Roberts

14:06.428 --> 14:08.138
because he's already back in prison.

14:08.305 --> 14:10.140
Stuart's phone records.

14:10.432 --> 14:12.476
It appears he made
consistent calls to a number

14:12.560 --> 14:15.104
belonging to Madison Sinclair.

14:15.771 --> 14:17.690
Nia wrote an article about her.

14:17.773 --> 14:18.899
She's a diamond broker.

14:18.983 --> 14:21.443
One of the people who invested
in the East City project.

14:21.527 --> 14:24.572
It appears he frequented a restaurant
right by her house

14:24.780 --> 14:26.699
several times
over the past couple of months

14:26.907 --> 14:28.701
and again this morning.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.495
I don't think this was a hate crime.

14:31.579 --> 14:34.874
I think he's having an affair,
and on Valentine's Day.

14:34.957 --> 14:36.458
We still need to make sure he's safe.

14:36.750 --> 14:38.502
<i>A series of alien attacks</i>

14:38.586 --> 14:42.298
<i>has the citizens of National City</i>
<i>in a place of deep unrest...</i>

14:42.798 --> 14:44.258
I'm Colonel Lauren Haley.

14:44.341 --> 14:46.385
Yes, I'm aware.

14:48.220 --> 14:50.306
You're not surprised
to see me in your office.

14:50.389 --> 14:51.390
I'm a Luthor.

14:51.473 --> 14:53.392
I've learned to expect
the unexpected.

14:54.226 --> 14:56.353
Now, what can I help you with?

14:56.437 --> 14:58.814
I'm here on behalf of
the President of the United States

14:58.898 --> 15:00.524
to offer you a government contract.

15:01.317 --> 15:02.735
For what purpose?

15:02.818 --> 15:04.528
People are terrified

15:04.862 --> 15:06.739
after the turmoil
created by that drug

15:06.822 --> 15:08.574
that gave humans super strength.

15:10.159 --> 15:12.995
The President understands your
research is exploring this arena.

15:14.496 --> 15:15.789
Ms. Luthor,

15:16.123 --> 15:19.418
we need to make
the US military as powerful

15:19.752 --> 15:21.503
as our alien adversaries.

15:23.422 --> 15:25.716
This is not what I had in mind
when I started my research.

15:25.799 --> 15:27.509
<i>...National City on high alert</i>

15:27.593 --> 15:31.722

<i>alien feeding on human hearts.</i>

15:31.805 --> 15:35.142
<i>Sources put the death toll</i>
<i>at three already.</i>

15:35.476 --> 15:37.478
This is precisely why we need you.

15:38.395 --> 15:39.939
I need to go.

15:40.356 --> 15:42.691
I'll email you a proposal.

15:44.151 --> 15:45.611
Please think about it.

15:45.694 --> 15:46.946
<i>Children of Liberty are calling</i>

15:47.029 --> 15:48.989
<i>for the immediate release</i>
<i>of Ben Lockwood,</i>

15:49.073 --> 15:51.283
<i>stating that he is an American hero</i>

15:51.367 --> 15:52.910
<i>and not a terrorist.</i>

15:53.243 --> 15:56.956
<i>Meanwhile, the Children of Liberty</i>
<i>continue to grow their membership</i>

15:57.039 --> 15:59.708
<i>with new chapters</i>
<i>arising throughout the city.</i>

16:10.761 --> 16:13.806
Agent Liberty needs us
to find this alien killer.

16:13.889 --> 16:16.433
Let us be the ones
who kill it in his name.

16:16.517 --> 16:18.644
Then we can demand
that he be set free.

16:29.571 --> 16:31.115
He's here. That's his car.

16:31.198 --> 16:32.449
Should we knock?

16:33.033 --> 16:34.034
Well...

16:34.118 --> 16:35.995
What if they're... You know...

16:36.078 --> 16:38.205
Well, I can't use my x-ray vision.

16:47.965 --> 16:49.717
Ms. Sinclair?

16:50.843 --> 16:52.177
Mr. Stuart?

16:56.432 --> 16:57.933
He's right here.

17:01.937 --> 17:03.689
I found Ms. Sinclair.

17:06.316 --> 17:07.776
His heart's missing.

17:11.947 --> 17:13.866
-Don't move! Hands in the air.
-Freeze right there!

17:13.949 --> 17:15.743
-Everybody down...
-Wait, wait. Hold your fire.

17:17.411 --> 17:19.163
What are you two doing here?

17:25.627 --> 17:28.005
Kara, you don't need to be
seeing all this. You should go.

17:28.088 --> 17:31.008
I'm fine. I've been
to plenty of crime scenes,

17:31.091 --> 17:33.469
covering it for CatCo.
In fact, since I'm here,

17:33.802 --> 17:36.346
maybe I could help the investigation.

17:36.430 --> 17:38.849
She is the one that helped find
the lead that got us here.

17:47.941 --> 17:51.153
You said you thought Ms. Sinclair
was being targeted by this alien

17:51.236 --> 17:53.405
because she was a diamond broker?

17:53.489 --> 17:55.407
-Mmm-hmm.
-Hmm.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.954
Whoa. It's a hidden door.

18:01.038 --> 18:02.998
That's a good find!
Don't you think, Alex?

18:03.082 --> 18:04.458
Nice work, Kara.

18:05.501 --> 18:08.045
This looks like this could be,
I don't know, like an acid

18:08.128 --> 18:11.507
or maybe even a venom
given the alien we're looking for.

18:11.590 --> 18:14.134
Could you run it for
trace radioactivity?

18:14.218 --> 18:15.219
Perhaps to track it?

18:15.302 --> 18:16.678
How did you know we could do that?

18:17.221 --> 18:19.765
Winn, always bragging about

18:19.848 --> 18:22.142
how he did things.
Off the record, of course.

18:23.894 --> 18:25.312
Couldn't you get Brainy to scan it?

18:25.979 --> 18:26.980
Uh...

18:27.272 --> 18:28.732
Yeah, Agent Dox?

18:28.816 --> 18:30.442
<i>-Yes, Director Danvers.</i>

18:30.526 --> 18:32.444
Is that music? Where are you?

18:32.986 --> 18:34.446
I am at the party we discussed.

18:34.988 --> 18:36.949
<i>It was called for happy hour </i>

18:37.241 --> 18:40.744
and I haven't yet conversed with
the person I spoke about earlier.

18:41.453 --> 18:43.163
Hey, this is my jam.

18:43.247 --> 18:45.624
Stop talking to yourself and dance.

18:46.583 --> 18:49.211
Also, it might be difficult for me
to extricate myself at the moment.

18:49.294 --> 18:51.463
Okay, well, stay put.
We're coming to you.

18:51.630 --> 18:52.631
Hurry.

18:54.216 --> 18:55.467
Why are you smiling like that?

18:55.926 --> 18:56.927
You said, "we."

18:58.303 --> 19:00.597
Of course you did,
'cause Brainy's at Nia's

19:00.681 --> 19:02.391
and J'onn will fly us there.

19:05.227 --> 19:07.271
<i>Anthony Stuart,</i>
<i>the Director of Alien Affairs,</i>

19:07.354 --> 19:09.189
<i>was murdered today in his home...</i>

19:09.273 --> 19:11.608
Do you have an update from Haley
about this alien menace

19:11.692 --> 19:13.986
-that killed him?
-The DEO is following all leads.

19:14.194 --> 19:17.823
Please remind the Colonel this is why
our new initiative is so important.

19:18.323 --> 19:20.075
These Lockwood protests,

19:22.119 --> 19:23.829
starting to becoming a nuisance.

19:25.247 --> 19:27.374
I think it's time we did
something about him.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.585
I'll bring you options tonight, sir.

19:36.717 --> 19:38.051
Brainy?

19:39.386 --> 19:40.721
You guys see him?

19:41.096 --> 19:42.097
Mmm-mmm.

19:42.598 --> 19:43.849
That's a negative.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.017
Alex?

19:45.309 --> 19:46.727
How have you been, stranger?

19:48.478 --> 19:50.230
It's Becca. We had drinks.

19:51.690 --> 19:53.400
-Twice.
-Becca!

19:53.734 --> 19:55.694
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry,
I never called you.

19:56.278 --> 19:58.572
My life, it's just been so crazy.

19:58.655 --> 20:00.407
It happens. Wanna grab a drink?

20:00.616 --> 20:02.201
You know what? Actually, I have to...

20:02.284 --> 20:04.828
Come on, don't tell me you don't
have time to at least catch up.

20:04.995 --> 20:08.290
-Um... Uh, yeah.
-Go, go, catch up. We'll find him.

20:08.498 --> 20:09.499
Okay.

20:09.833 --> 20:12.211
Seems like she didn't need
a wing-woman.

20:16.590 --> 20:18.175
Paris, here we come!

20:18.258 --> 20:19.718
And not a moment too soon.

20:24.306 --> 20:25.474
Hey.

20:30.437 --> 20:33.273
I heard your call to arms and, uh,

20:34.191 --> 20:35.859
I'm really proud of you, George.

20:35.943 --> 20:39.488
The Children of Liberty are out there
searching for that alien killer.

20:39.571 --> 20:41.448
And I'm just not sure what to do next.

20:42.157 --> 20:44.243
You've got to
take care of it publicly.

20:44.326 --> 20:46.453
People have to know
that it's us.

20:47.162 --> 20:48.872
I don't know if I can.

20:48.956 --> 20:50.832
George, I know what it's like
to be scared.

20:50.916 --> 20:51.917
All of us do.
But then,

20:53.877 --> 20:56.546
an opportunity can present itself.

20:57.047 --> 20:58.257
And like a switch,

21:00.509 --> 21:01.802
your whole world changes

21:02.052 --> 21:06.515
and you find clarity
and focus and strength

21:07.724 --> 21:09.017
like you have never known.

21:10.894 --> 21:11.895
So, what I need you to do

21:11.979 --> 21:13.772
is just look out
for that opportunity.

21:14.439 --> 21:15.440
And trust it.
And you will take it.

21:26.618 --> 21:27.619
I don't think he's here.

21:27.995 --> 21:29.705
I'm right here.

21:35.419 --> 21:37.296
Brainy, what are you
doing in the closet?

21:37.379 --> 21:40.132
I just escaped Yvette,
Nia's roommate.

21:40.382 --> 21:43.093
Apparently every song is her jam.

21:44.553 --> 21:45.554
Do you have the samples?

21:47.806 --> 21:48.974
Just take a few minutes.

21:57.482 --> 21:58.859
Well, you go. I'll stay here.

22:03.196 --> 22:04.197
You okay?

22:05.157 --> 22:06.283
Yeah, come sit.

22:08.118 --> 22:09.703
You're gonna get through this,
you know.

22:10.120 --> 22:11.580
Just go easy on yourself.

22:12.456 --> 22:13.457
And you have me.

22:14.041 --> 22:15.709
You don't know how much
I appreciate that.

22:16.460 --> 22:17.461
Just...

22:19.087 --> 22:21.006
Think about how much
your mother loved you

22:22.382 --> 22:23.925
and what she would've wanted for you

22:24.926 --> 22:25.927
and try to honor that.

22:27.512 --> 22:28.638
She would want me to dream.

22:31.933 --> 22:32.934
But my sister...

22:33.018 --> 22:35.729
You can't let her stop you
from embracing your destiny.

22:36.980 --> 22:39.858
I hid who I was for far too long
because of my family.

22:39.941 --> 22:42.861
Even Alex didn't think
it was a good idea at first.

22:42.944 --> 22:45.280
At least now she knows everything
and supports you.

22:46.823 --> 22:47.824
Actually, um...

22:49.826 --> 22:52.037
Alex doesn't know
I'm Supergirl anymore.

22:54.748 --> 22:56.041
She had her mind wiped.

22:56.124 --> 22:57.209
To protect her.

23:00.754 --> 23:02.756
But I can't let that stop me

23:02.839 --> 23:04.549
from helping the people
that need my help

23:04.633 --> 23:07.469
and doing the good that I can do.

23:08.678 --> 23:11.389
And you could do a lot of good, too.

23:13.266 --> 23:14.601
You're a part of my family now.

23:16.061 --> 23:17.938
And all heroes are welcome.

23:20.398 --> 23:21.399
<i>So, catch me up.</i>

23:21.942 --> 23:24.528
The FBI must be crazy,
with all the stuff that's happening.

23:24.694 --> 23:26.154
-Yeah.
-And your adoption.

23:26.238 --> 23:27.447
Tell me you have a kid

23:27.531 --> 23:28.615
and that's
your excuse for not calling.

23:28.698 --> 23:30.659
A kid... Um... Not yet.

23:31.368 --> 23:33.954
Sorry, I know how excited
you were about it.

23:34.037 --> 23:35.747
Yeah, I was. I, uh...

23:35.956 --> 23:37.290
Guess I kind of dropped the ball.

23:37.707 --> 23:38.917
Then pick it back up.

23:41.044 --> 23:44.631
Will you excuse me?
My friends, they need me.

23:45.382 --> 23:47.259
I really am sorry that I didn't call.

23:49.177 --> 23:50.178
What did you find?

23:50.554 --> 23:51.805
No radiation signature,

23:51.888 --> 23:54.182
but I did find human DNA
in the sample.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.350
It's another victim?

23:55.433 --> 23:56.560
I would assume.

23:56.852 --> 23:58.562
I found a match for the DNA in CODIS,

23:58.645 --> 23:59.688
Pamela Ferrer.

23:59.771 --> 24:03.233
But according to NCPD,
she's yet to be reported as missing.

24:03.859 --> 24:04.985
Do you have an address?

24:05.443 --> 24:07.195
Is a Klaramarian yellow?
I think that means yes.

24:10.198 --> 24:11.491
Yes, obviously.

24:12.325 --> 24:14.327
Her home is actually
just a few blocks away.

24:15.078 --> 24:16.246
We should move out.

24:16.329 --> 24:18.373
No, no, no.
Brainy and I will move out.

24:18.456 --> 24:19.833
But that was so fun.

24:19.916 --> 24:21.793
Seeing you in action
at the crime scene.

24:21.877 --> 24:23.003
Kara, it could be dangerous.

24:23.086 --> 24:24.421
Just think of it as a ride along.

24:25.046 --> 24:28.758
The press, tagging along to see
how the government protects the city.

24:28.842 --> 24:30.010
Yeah, I'll come along, too.

24:30.510 --> 24:31.928
All right, well, just stick together.

24:32.012 --> 24:33.013
Sure.

24:39.519 --> 24:40.770
Pamela Ferrer?

24:41.938 --> 24:42.939
Are you here?

24:43.023 --> 24:44.107
This is the FBI.

24:45.942 --> 24:46.943
Pamela?

24:47.027 --> 24:48.320
I'm Pamela Ferrer.
Is there a problem?

24:49.946 --> 24:52.449
Yes, there is very much a problem.

24:53.408 --> 24:54.409
Brainy!

24:54.492 --> 24:57.412
Pamela Ferrer's DNA was co-mingled
with the alien venom we found.

24:57.495 --> 24:58.496
They were linked.

24:58.955 --> 25:00.207
Mandating contact.

25:00.290 --> 25:02.500
She should not be alive,
let alone unharmed.

25:02.918 --> 25:03.919
With Valentine's Day,

25:04.002 --> 25:05.462
I must be more preoccupied
than I thought

25:05.545 --> 25:06.713
because the only logical conclusion

25:06.796 --> 25:09.591
is that snake didn't morph
into that creature I showed you.

25:10.217 --> 25:12.344
But rather it merged with that woman.

25:12.427 --> 25:13.678
The alien is a symbiote?

25:13.762 --> 25:14.763
Yes.

25:14.846 --> 25:17.599
I am 98.9% certain

25:17.682 --> 25:19.851
that she is the beast
we're looking for.

25:22.938 --> 25:24.022
Whoa.

25:25.315 --> 25:26.983
Make that 100%.

25:27.651 --> 25:29.527
Pamela, we just wanna help.

25:29.611 --> 25:31.571
There is something
inside you making you do this.

25:31.696 --> 25:32.697
If you try to fight it--
Fight it?

25:33.865 --> 25:34.866
Why would I fight it?

25:34.950 --> 25:36.910
This is the most powerful
I have ever felt.

25:38.870 --> 25:40.038
And I am not Pamela.

25:40.413 --> 25:42.499
We are Menagerie.

25:50.840 --> 25:51.841
I hate snakes.
Kara, run!

25:55.387 --> 25:56.388
- Kara, no!

26:05.939 --> 26:06.940
Are you okay?

26:07.023 --> 26:08.525
It's totally fine. She missed me.

26:12.737 --> 26:13.738
I'm fine.

26:13.822 --> 26:16.116
I told you, it just ripped my jacket.

26:16.199 --> 26:18.410
I found these,
full of jewels and money.

26:18.493 --> 26:21.121
It would appear Pamela Ferrer
is a jewel thief,

26:21.705 --> 26:23.790
likely accomplice
to our first victim.

26:24.291 --> 26:26.251
Okay, so the hearts were
for the symbiote

26:26.334 --> 26:27.502
and the jewels were for her.

26:27.585 --> 26:29.879
Now that we know the symbiote's
human counterpart,

26:29.963 --> 26:30.964
we can track her.

26:31.464 --> 26:33.091
Okay, Brainy,
you get back to the DEO,

26:33.174 --> 26:35.885
use your facial algorithm to find her
and then, uh...

26:35.969 --> 26:37.887
I'll meet you back there
after I take Kara home.

26:37.971 --> 26:39.389
I told you, I'm fine.

26:39.472 --> 26:41.308
I am tougher than you think I am.

26:41.391 --> 26:44.978
Look, I would never forgive myself
if something happened to you.

26:45.145 --> 26:48.106
Kara, you're the most
important person in the world to me

26:48.481 --> 26:50.734
and your safety is
my number one priority.

26:50.817 --> 26:52.402
Nothing comes before that.

26:54.237 --> 26:57.032
You know what? You're right.
I do feel a little shaky.

26:57.490 --> 26:58.992
I'll take her home.

26:59.075 --> 27:00.076
Okay.

27:04.247 --> 27:06.082
All right, sweep this place,
leave a patrol.

27:06.166 --> 27:07.792
If she comes back,
I wanna know about it.

27:21.014 --> 27:23.183
The government wants to partner
with me in my research

27:23.266 --> 27:24.601
into making humans super.

27:30.190 --> 27:33.651
Lena, I know how much
your research means to you,

27:33.735 --> 27:34.944
which is why I can't fathom

27:35.028 --> 27:37.030
why you would want
to share it with the government.

27:38.823 --> 27:40.283
I thought you supported my work.

27:40.367 --> 27:42.786
Look, I know that I said
that I understand this...

27:43.912 --> 27:45.997
Moral gray area
that you're treading on.

27:46.998 --> 27:49.042
But if you share your research
with the government,

27:49.667 --> 27:50.794
they're gonna militarize it.

27:52.420 --> 27:54.464
And who knows what kind
of chaos that can create.

27:56.049 --> 27:59.010
I know I said that I'd try
to understand your point of view

27:59.094 --> 28:00.678
but I don't know if I can
on this one.

28:06.601 --> 28:07.602
Are you saying...

28:09.187 --> 28:12.607
That forgiving me
and us trying again was a mistake?

28:12.690 --> 28:15.485
No, no, no. I'm... No.
There's no mistakes, no.

28:15.819 --> 28:16.820
I love you.
And you love me.

28:19.906 --> 28:22.742
But I also know you, and I know
that you're better than this.

28:24.160 --> 28:25.662
I will not allow you to judge me

28:25.745 --> 28:27.997
for my using my science
for the betterment of humanity.

28:29.124 --> 28:30.667
That's fair. Okay.

28:31.418 --> 28:33.169
You're right,
and I don't wanna judge.

28:33.670 --> 28:35.672
But to be straightforward,
I am never

28:36.673 --> 28:39.300
going to agree with you sharing
your research with the government.

28:41.761 --> 28:43.513
And I think that
that could destroy us.

28:48.059 --> 28:49.060
You're probably right.
I think you should leave.

29:01.573 --> 29:02.574
So, that's it, then?

29:06.786 --> 29:08.663
It was always inevitable, wasn't it?

29:14.210 --> 29:15.211
Frank, stop the car.

29:51.748 --> 29:52.874
Girl, are you okay?

29:53.708 --> 29:54.709
Yeah.

29:55.668 --> 29:56.753
Just a bad dream.

29:56.836 --> 29:58.463
I liked it better when
you stayed up all night.

29:58.546 --> 30:01.007
Now, help me clean this up.
I'm not doing this work by myself.

30:02.509 --> 30:05.261
We tried, but I can't work with Alex.

30:05.678 --> 30:07.472
Not as Supergirl or as Kara.

30:07.555 --> 30:08.556
She got spooked.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.892
That doesn't mean she didn't
enjoy working with you before that.

30:10.975 --> 30:12.852
When she thought
I was bit by that snake,

30:14.395 --> 30:16.314
I've seen that look in her eyes
a million times.

30:18.066 --> 30:20.527
It's love, but it's also deep fear.

30:20.610 --> 30:23.363
That's the depth of love we have
for the people we care about most.

30:23.446 --> 30:24.781
But it's a problem when that love

30:24.864 --> 30:27.325
stops someone from going after
what they want for themselves.

30:28.201 --> 30:30.078
And you think that's what
Alex does for you?

30:33.498 --> 30:34.582
Remember when she said

30:34.666 --> 30:37.168
she felt like her life was on pause
and she didn't know why?

30:37.252 --> 30:39.254
She couldn't figure out
what was holding her back.

30:39.337 --> 30:40.338
It's me.

30:40.588 --> 30:41.923
I'm what's holding her back.

30:44.676 --> 30:46.261
She was doing so well this summer.

30:46.344 --> 30:48.012
She was dating again.

30:48.096 --> 30:51.057
She was moving forward
with the adoption and then

30:51.307 --> 30:52.767
that Kryptonite bomb hit,

30:52.851 --> 30:54.686
and she dropped everything
to take care of me.

30:56.312 --> 30:58.022
Well, please don't
blame yourself for that.

30:58.106 --> 30:59.107
That wasn't your fault.

30:59.607 --> 31:01.359
Alex isn't pursuing her dreams

31:01.860 --> 31:04.237
because she's so focused
on protecting me.

31:04.737 --> 31:06.406
And now that her mind is wiped,

31:07.240 --> 31:10.326
now that she doesn't remember
her sister is Supergirl,

31:11.995 --> 31:13.496
she's finally free of that.

31:15.748 --> 31:17.500
But not if I work with her as Kara.

31:18.126 --> 31:20.670
Oh, man. I feel like this mind wipe

31:20.837 --> 31:24.507
has hurt our family in so many
more ways than we could ever foresee.

31:24.966 --> 31:26.342
Maybe this is what's best for her.

31:27.427 --> 31:28.595
Alex wants a baby.

31:28.678 --> 31:30.847
She wants a partner.

31:31.389 --> 31:33.433
And now she's finally free
to pursue that.

31:34.100 --> 31:37.020
And, no, I won't
get to work with her, but...

31:37.896 --> 31:39.480
I'll still have my sister.

31:41.274 --> 31:42.275
And I'll still have you.
Got it.

31:46.905 --> 31:49.240
Oh, my God.
All these agents are dead.

31:49.449 --> 31:50.450
That tip was right.

31:50.533 --> 31:52.785
Spread out.
See if that alien is still here.

31:53.995 --> 31:55.580
I hope it's not still here.

32:02.962 --> 32:03.963
All the loot is gone.

32:04.756 --> 32:05.924
They took everything.

32:06.007 --> 32:09.552
That's what humans on this planet
always do.

32:12.263 --> 32:14.057
Heart Association's masquerade ball.

32:16.059 --> 32:18.102
It's time for me to start
rebuilding my net worth.

32:21.981 --> 32:24.359
<i>She's heading to the Heart</i>
<i>Association masquerade ball downtown.</i>

32:24.442 --> 32:25.443
<i>I'll send the video.</i>

32:25.526 --> 32:26.736
I'll send this out
to my father's network

32:26.819 --> 32:28.488
so they can get there
and kill that thing.

32:28.571 --> 32:29.572
<i>Okay.</i>

32:54.013 --> 32:56.182
I've always had a thing
for a man with a diamond watch.

33:12.657 --> 33:14.283
Love your necklace.

33:14.367 --> 33:17.662
Hey! Every human, get out now!

33:18.830 --> 33:20.206
We're gonna kill that alien.

33:20.748 --> 33:22.250
You know it's rude to yell at people.

33:32.510 --> 33:33.511
You found her?
Not me.

33:34.679 --> 33:35.763
The Children of Liberty.

33:36.180 --> 33:37.724
They just uploaded footage
of Menagerie

33:37.807 --> 33:40.852
at the National City
Heart Association masquerade ball.

33:41.352 --> 33:43.730
Which I must say, is ironic.

33:44.814 --> 33:46.149
Have a team meet me at the van.

33:46.232 --> 33:48.401
Last thing this city needs
is a live slaughter.

33:49.110 --> 33:52.363
Girl, that ball is
right around the corner.

33:53.781 --> 33:55.867
This neighborhood
is really going to the pits.

33:58.661 --> 33:59.704
Where are you going?

34:03.624 --> 34:04.792
Move. Move.

34:07.545 --> 34:09.255
Children of Liberty, stand down.

34:10.506 --> 34:11.507
Stand down!

34:26.606 --> 34:27.607
Menagerie.

34:39.702 --> 34:42.288
You should have better taste
than to protect those people.

34:42.580 --> 34:45.041
I protect everyone.

34:45.291 --> 34:46.292
Your loss.
Literally.

35:04.602 --> 35:05.603
That was amazing.

35:05.978 --> 35:07.313
Saw it in a dream.

35:12.026 --> 35:13.402
Probably should've seen that, too.

35:13.903 --> 35:16.155
Alex could use your help inside,
I'll deal with her.

35:24.622 --> 35:27.750
However many Symbeasts you unleash,
I have the power to stop them.

35:27.959 --> 35:30.545
You Kryptonians think
you're so powerful on your own.

35:30.920 --> 35:32.171
You know nothing of the symbiosis

35:32.255 --> 35:33.798
that comes from being a part of a team.

35:35.967 --> 35:36.968
Argh!

35:42.306 --> 35:43.516
There!

35:43.599 --> 35:45.393
Don't kill her, she's disabled.
-I can bring her in. No!

36:00.074 --> 36:04.036
We protected the humans of this city
by killing a monster.

36:04.120 --> 36:05.163
Yeah.

36:06.122 --> 36:07.790
Not even Supergirl could do that.

36:08.332 --> 36:11.210
Liberty! Liberty!

36:11.460 --> 36:13.462
-Liberty!
-Director?

36:13.546 --> 36:15.715
These officers will
take it from here.

36:16.174 --> 36:17.175
Colonel.

36:17.258 --> 36:18.926
The alien inside her was killed.

36:19.010 --> 36:20.344
So, she no longer poses a threat.

36:20.428 --> 36:22.388
The President wants her
made an example of.

36:22.847 --> 36:24.724
Sent to prison instead
of some black ops site

36:24.807 --> 36:25.808
where no one can see her.

36:25.892 --> 36:27.977
Shouldn't the FBI be making
a statement to the press?

36:28.102 --> 36:29.520
Let them know that
the Children of Liberty
actually made this
whole thing harder?

36:31.105 --> 36:33.983
We spent more time protecting them
than stopping her.

36:34.150 --> 36:36.360
Well, then we'd have to
give credit to Supergirl.

36:36.444 --> 36:38.863
You think that'd make things better
with that crowd?

36:39.697 --> 36:41.532
It should've been us, Director.

36:41.616 --> 36:42.867
Without any assistance.

36:42.950 --> 36:44.410
Supergirl is not the enemy, Colonel.

36:44.493 --> 36:46.871
Yeah, but we have to start handling
these aliens on our own.

36:46.954 --> 36:49.790
I'll update you tomorrow on
the President's plan to get us there.

36:50.583 --> 36:51.584
Yes, ma'am.

36:54.045 --> 36:56.297
I thought we were done
with the Children of Liberty.

36:56.380 --> 36:59.133
They took credit for
this win, but the truth will prevail.

36:59.217 --> 37:01.219
I'm sorry you can't be
down there with your sister.

37:01.552 --> 37:05.306
We're still on the same team,
just from a distance.

37:07.725 --> 37:08.726
Nice suit.

37:10.311 --> 37:11.395
It was my mother's.

37:12.063 --> 37:13.397
And you were right, you know.

37:13.856 --> 37:15.274
I honored her by fighting tonight.

37:17.485 --> 37:19.946
You do realize you could've
gotten yourself killed?

37:20.029 --> 37:21.030
-Absolutely.
-Okay.

37:22.573 --> 37:23.741
Yeah, there was, um...

37:24.533 --> 37:26.327
There was a lot that
I should've seen coming.

37:27.536 --> 37:30.331
Your powers give you the potential
to be a great hero.

37:31.457 --> 37:33.376
But you still have to learn
how to control them.

37:35.002 --> 37:36.003
So, get to work.
Brainy?

37:44.804 --> 37:46.013
Yes, it is.

37:46.389 --> 37:47.974
Look what he brought me.

37:48.516 --> 37:49.517
Uh...

37:49.600 --> 37:54.730
Yes, well, technically I did give
Yvette that heart-shaped box.

37:54.814 --> 37:56.274
It wasn't actually meant for her.

37:56.357 --> 37:59.193
It's fine, Brainy.
I don't need chocolates from you.

38:01.195 --> 38:02.822
What I need is for you
to help me train.

38:06.117 --> 38:08.286
Try the coconut. It's the best one.

38:10.037 --> 38:11.414
So, it seems

38:11.497 --> 38:15.960
all Valentines candy
goes to 80% off after midnight.

38:16.043 --> 38:17.545
Whoa.

38:17.628 --> 38:18.796
You shouldn't have.

38:19.880 --> 38:21.215
But I'm glad you did.

38:22.300 --> 38:23.301
Hey, I, uh...

38:25.177 --> 38:27.471
I wanted to apologize about before.

38:28.306 --> 38:31.309
I just felt like this trigger
went off

38:31.392 --> 38:33.352
when I thought I saw you get hurt.

38:33.436 --> 38:34.729
I'm sure it was scary.

38:34.812 --> 38:36.522
But all it did was
just tear your jacket.

38:37.481 --> 38:39.775
And look, I know,
this is the first time that you and I

38:39.859 --> 38:42.445
have been in a situation
like this before.

38:42.820 --> 38:44.905
But I think my go-to response is just

38:45.281 --> 38:47.450
protect anybody that I see
that's in trouble,

38:47.783 --> 38:49.285
whether they want me to or not.

38:49.869 --> 38:50.870
But...

38:51.454 --> 38:56.167
I realize that the person that
I most often forget to protect...

38:57.877 --> 38:58.878
Is me.

38:59.587 --> 39:02.214
Well, trust me.
I won't be tagging along

39:02.298 --> 39:05.551
for any crime scene
investigations anymore.

39:05.676 --> 39:06.886
No, no, no. It's not you.

39:07.386 --> 39:11.599
I need to start trusting that people
can also protect themselves.

39:11.974 --> 39:13.392
You know, that way I can just start

39:13.476 --> 39:17.355
focusing my energy into
the things that I want.

39:17.938 --> 39:21.400
And... I'm finally ready.

39:21.984 --> 39:22.985
Well, good.

39:23.277 --> 39:27.698
'Cause I got that girl from
Nia's party's number for you.

39:27.823 --> 39:29.158
Oh.

39:29.450 --> 39:31.660
Becca, that's her name.

39:36.415 --> 39:37.416
I'm gonna call her.

39:37.875 --> 39:39.543
And then I'm just gonna
start pushing play

39:39.627 --> 39:41.045
on all the things that I wanna do.

39:41.796 --> 39:45.299
And I'm gonna finish
that adoption portfolio

39:45.383 --> 39:47.426
and submit the forms.

39:48.469 --> 39:49.929
I can cheers to that.

39:51.889 --> 39:52.890
Yes.
I'm in.

40:15.162 --> 40:16.163
Did you find something?
Yes, sir.

40:17.748 --> 40:21.585
The Patriot Act only protects
human life from acts of terrorism.

40:21.669 --> 40:23.462
Lockwood can't be charged under it.

40:27.550 --> 40:29.927
Get the White House counsel
to sign off, now.

40:39.812 --> 40:40.813
I wasn't afraid.

40:42.731 --> 40:43.858
<i>Today is a good day.</i>

40:43.941 --> 40:47.153
The Children of Liberty protected
the citizens of National City

40:47.236 --> 40:49.905
against a murderous alien and

40:49.989 --> 40:53.325
the President of the United States
finally understands

40:53.659 --> 40:54.994
that our one mission

40:55.703 --> 40:57.621
is to safeguard human life.

40:57.830 --> 41:00.708
So, I stand before you now,
a free man,

41:01.041 --> 41:04.879
ready to continue to serve
this great nation.

41:05.045 --> 41:07.173
-Thank you for your support.

41:11.135 --> 41:12.136
Letter for you.
From who?

41:17.641 --> 41:18.642
Manchester Black.
