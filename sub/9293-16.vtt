00:14.568 --> 00:15.600
Yeah.

00:15.667 --> 00:16.633
Mark Hauser?

00:16.700 --> 00:17.667
Who's this?

00:17.733 --> 00:19.167
You know who it is.

00:19.234 --> 00:21.534
MARK:
 <i>I already gave you</i>
 <i>what you asked for.</i>

00:21.600 --> 00:22.667
But your employer

00:22.733 --> 00:24.700
has tightened security,

00:24.767 --> 00:26.767
so the access I paid for
is no good.

00:26.834 --> 00:29.867
It'll take some time to download
the new security protocols.

00:29.934 --> 00:32.034
I'll give them 40 minutes.

00:32.101 --> 00:33.967
Federal agent!

00:34.034 --> 00:35.334
Down on the floor!

00:35.401 --> 00:38.267
 <i>Bill, Hauser admitted</i>
 <i>to selling Gredenko</i>

00:38.334 --> 00:40.800
the security specs for Edgemont
nuclear power facility.

00:40.867 --> 00:42.301
Does Gredenko have the specs?

00:42.367 --> 00:44.267
Not yet. He's going to pick
them up in about 20 minutes.

00:44.334 --> 00:46.101
Hauser was wounded, but he's got
a brother that Gredenko knows.

00:46.167 --> 00:47.334
We're going to use him

00:47.401 --> 00:49.134
 <i>to go through</i>
 <i>with the transaction.</i>

00:49.201 --> 00:51.301
You look nervous, Brady.

00:53.201 --> 00:54.501
All teams,
take out your targets.

00:56.034 --> 00:58.134
There's a third hostile
inside the vehicle!

01:00.900 --> 01:02.534
You know who I am

01:02.534 --> 01:04.834
and you know
what I'm going to do to you

01:04.900 --> 01:07.034
unless you tell me
where the bombs are.

01:07.101 --> 01:08.367
First my terms:

01:08.434 --> 01:09.900
amnesty from

01:09.967 --> 01:14.167
your government and a guarantee
I won't be returned to Russia.

01:14.234 --> 01:16.633
Nadia's being processed
as an enemy combatant.

01:16.700 --> 01:20.201
I don't know if I can accept
that she betrayed us.

01:20.267 --> 01:21.501
She spied for Fayed?

01:21.568 --> 01:23.767
 <i>I think we're wrong.</i>

01:23.834 --> 01:25.501
I hear you and Nadia Yassir
are friends.

01:25.568 --> 01:26.800
Yeah. Why do you ask?

01:26.867 --> 01:28.167
'Cause I came across

01:28.234 --> 01:30.234
evidence
at the switching station

01:30.301 --> 01:31.234
that proves Nadia's innocent.

01:31.301 --> 01:33.700
You're clear, Nadia.

01:35.267 --> 01:38.534
Admiral Smith,
is the <i>Vickery</i> ready to launch?

01:38.600 --> 01:40.700
It's seconds from
optimal launch position,

01:40.767 --> 01:41.934
Mr. Vice President.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.667
Good, proceed
with the strike.

01:43.733 --> 01:45.667
HAYES:
Vice President Daniels

01:45.733 --> 01:49.600
is about to launch a nuclear
strike against the Middle East.

01:49.667 --> 01:52.101
This strike is a complete
reversal of everything

01:52.167 --> 01:54.568
your brother was working for.

01:54.633 --> 01:58.167
You want Dr. Welton
to bring him out of the coma.

01:58.234 --> 01:59.934
Yes.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.201
(phone rings)

02:01.267 --> 02:03.067
It's for you, sir.

02:03.134 --> 02:05.201
Yes.

02:05.267 --> 02:06.633
I've called off the strike,
Noah.

02:06.700 --> 02:09.067
I'm resuming my duties
as Commander in Chief.

02:09.133 --> 02:10.733
Inform Admiral Smith
and the others

02:10.800 --> 02:13.267
there's to be no hostile action
without my direct

02:13.334 --> 02:15.067
authorization.

02:15.134 --> 02:18.101
It's apparent to me that
the president is still suffering

02:18.167 --> 02:21.967
the effects
from the attack on his life.

02:22.034 --> 02:23.600
I can't let him remain in power.

02:25.468 --> 02:27.667
Get me the Attorney General.

02:29.000 --> 02:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:38.434 --> 02:41.568
LENNOX: Secretary Dawes,
can you see and hear me clearly?

02:41.633 --> 02:43.000
Yes, I can.

02:43.067 --> 02:45.101
What about Secretary Durant
and Attorney General Graves?

02:45.167 --> 02:47.401
Their connections
are being set up now.

02:47.468 --> 02:48.401
How about the president?

02:48.468 --> 02:50.167
He should be arriving
any moment.

02:56.034 --> 02:57.034
What are you doing?

02:57.101 --> 02:58.834
I need to get up
from this wheelchair.

02:58.900 --> 03:00.834
No, you need
to take care
of yourself.

03:00.900 --> 03:02.900
Sandra, I can't afford
to look weak.

03:02.967 --> 03:05.767
Roosevelt did just fine
from a wheelchair.

03:05.834 --> 03:08.667
Listen, when I face Daniels,
I want to be on my feet.

03:11.101 --> 03:12.800
Dr. Welton?

03:12.867 --> 03:14.367
Yes, sir?

03:16.267 --> 03:18.101
Can you give me a shot
of adrenaline?

03:18.167 --> 03:19.834
Wayne.

03:21.367 --> 03:23.367
I can.

03:23.434 --> 03:25.267
It'll raise your
blood pressure,

03:25.334 --> 03:26.934
which is not what
you need right now.

03:27.000 --> 03:27.967
Could elevate
the risk...
(knocking)

03:28.034 --> 03:30.867
Mr. President,
it is time.

03:30.934 --> 03:32.334
Give us a few minutes, please.

03:32.401 --> 03:33.633
Yes, sir.

03:33.700 --> 03:35.000
Excuse me,
Mr. President.

03:36.067 --> 03:37.267
Mr. President...

03:37.334 --> 03:38.667
Just do it.

03:42.767 --> 03:45.401
Now.

03:45.468 --> 03:47.334
(phone beeps)
What do you have, Jack?

03:47.401 --> 03:50.367
Gredenko offered us Fayed
in exchange for immunity

03:50.434 --> 03:52.667
and a guarantee that we won't
extradite him back to Russia.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.534
Bill, I don't trust him.

03:54.600 --> 03:55.834
He rolled over
too easy.

03:55.900 --> 03:57.367
What do you think
his play is?

03:57.434 --> 03:58.733
I don't know yet.

03:58.800 --> 04:00.568
Well, it's your call, Jack.

04:00.633 --> 04:02.867
But you should know
what's happening in Washington.

04:02.934 --> 04:06.000
President Palmer's
regained consciousness.

04:06.067 --> 04:07.234
How is he?

04:07.301 --> 04:09.234
Well enough to reassert
his claim on the presidency.

04:09.301 --> 04:12.167
but Daniels is challenging
him under the 25th amendment

04:12.234 --> 04:13.700
in large part
so he can go ahead

04:13.767 --> 04:16.000
with the nuclear strike
against Fayed's country.

04:16.067 --> 04:17.733
Does he have a chance
of winning?

04:17.800 --> 04:20.666
It's unclear, but if Fayed
detonates another bomb,

04:20.733 --> 04:23.167
no one will be able
to stand in Daniels' way.

04:23.234 --> 04:26.201
If there's a challenge
for the presidency,

04:26.267 --> 04:28.633
the immunity agreement
will have no authority.

04:28.700 --> 04:29.934
It won't be binding.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.034
Bill, you need to understand
that I have no intention

04:33.101 --> 04:34.301
of honoring
this agreement.

04:34.367 --> 04:37.267
Tell the Attorney General,
fill out the papers.

04:37.334 --> 04:39.101
I'm calling him right now.

04:42.900 --> 04:46.501
The president should be here
momentarily.

05:04.167 --> 05:06.800
Mr. President.
Mr. President.

05:12.067 --> 05:13.900
Mr. President,

05:13.967 --> 05:16.800
I know I speak
for everyone here in saying

05:16.867 --> 05:19.633
how very happy I am to have you
with us again.

05:22.867 --> 05:24.534
Let's proceed.

05:29.934 --> 05:33.034
(Lennox clears throat)

05:33.101 --> 05:37.034
LENNOX:
As you know, an attempt was made
to assassinate the president.

05:37.101 --> 05:40.067
He sustained injuries so serious
that the doctors had

05:40.134 --> 05:43.267
to induce a temporary coma

05:43.334 --> 05:45.367
in order to relieve
the pressure on his brain.

05:45.434 --> 05:47.468
In so doing,
they saved his life.

05:47.534 --> 05:49.800
The question now is whether,

05:49.867 --> 05:51.834
in the words
of the 25th amendment,

05:51.900 --> 05:57.534
he is unable to discharge the
duties and powers of his office.

05:57.600 --> 05:59.000
Mr. Lennox,

05:59.067 --> 06:00.134
isn't this really
a medical question?

06:00.201 --> 06:01.334
Well, to a degree it is,

06:01.401 --> 06:03.667
but the 25th amendment

06:03.733 --> 06:07.434
puts the final decision squarely
in the hands of the Cabinet.

06:07.501 --> 06:08.900
May we hear medical testimony?

06:08.967 --> 06:10.234
Yes, we may.

06:10.301 --> 06:12.067
And to that end, let me bring in
the surgeon in charge

06:12.134 --> 06:13.134
of the president's case.

06:13.201 --> 06:15.167
Dr. Welton,
if you would, please.

06:19.633 --> 06:23.800
The president has undergone
an ordeal,

06:23.867 --> 06:25.633
but from a medical
point of view,

06:25.700 --> 06:27.267
I believe the greatest danger
is passed.

06:27.334 --> 06:29.600
His cognitive functions
are presenting normally.

06:29.667 --> 06:31.767
I have every expectation
that President Palmer

06:31.834 --> 06:33.167
will make a full recovery.

06:33.234 --> 06:34.834
GILES:
Might the pressures
of the office

06:34.900 --> 06:36.367
increase the possibility
of a relapse?

06:36.434 --> 06:37.600
It's difficult to say.

06:37.667 --> 06:38.867
It's certainly a possibility.

06:38.934 --> 06:40.501
Can you estimate those chances?

06:40.568 --> 06:42.900
I'm afraid I can't.

06:42.967 --> 06:45.934
If you had a vote, Doctor,
how would you cast it?

06:46.000 --> 06:49.934
This is precisely the question
which the Constitution

06:50.000 --> 06:52.034
demands that
this Cabinet answer.

06:52.101 --> 06:53.501
Thank you very much, Doctor.

06:53.568 --> 06:56.934
Uh, Mr. President, I think now
would be an appropriate time

06:57.000 --> 07:00.900
to address the Cabinet,
if you would, please.

07:00.967 --> 07:03.700
The vice president initiated
this process

07:03.767 --> 07:05.867
because I stopped him
from launching a nuclear strike

07:05.934 --> 07:07.534
against the Middle East.

07:07.600 --> 07:10.067
But this vote shouldn't be
about policy.

07:10.134 --> 07:13.167
According to the Constitution,
you're judging me

07:13.234 --> 07:15.367
to see if I am unable

07:15.434 --> 07:17.733
to discharge the duties
of my office.

07:17.800 --> 07:21.501
Well, as you can see,
and as you were just told

07:21.568 --> 07:24.301
by my physician, I'm in complete
possession of my faculties,

07:24.367 --> 07:26.234
and so to remove me
from this office

07:26.301 --> 07:28.434
would be to betray
both your oath

07:28.501 --> 07:32.700
and the American people
who voted me as their president.

07:37.201 --> 07:40.434
All right, Mr. Vice President.

07:43.934 --> 07:46.234
Ladies and gentlemen
of the Cabinet,

07:46.301 --> 07:48.000
the 25th amendment
is purposely vague

07:48.067 --> 07:49.934
on how you're supposed
to judge if a president

07:50.000 --> 07:51.733
is unable to discharge
his duties.

07:51.800 --> 07:53.501
It's open
to interpretation,

07:53.568 --> 07:55.401
which is why
this is very much about

07:55.468 --> 07:58.301
the president's policies
and his actions.

07:58.367 --> 08:01.167
Here are the facts:

08:01.234 --> 08:04.000
When a second nuclear attack
today spread radiation

08:04.067 --> 08:06.534
over one of our major cities,
I decided

08:06.600 --> 08:09.667
it was necessary to launch
a retaliatory strike

08:09.733 --> 08:12.767
to show our enemies
that if attacked,

08:12.834 --> 08:15.700
we would make them share
our pain.

08:15.767 --> 08:18.267
Wayne Palmer's

08:18.334 --> 08:21.334
first act upon regaining
consciousness

08:21.401 --> 08:23.401
was to stop that strike;

08:23.468 --> 08:29.367
to respond to the attack
by doing nothing.

08:29.434 --> 08:31.834
In a time of war,

08:31.900 --> 08:34.633
the president must be strong
enough in body and mind

08:34.700 --> 08:36.067
to defend this country.

08:36.134 --> 08:39.600
And I'm afraid
Wayne Palmer's actions

08:39.667 --> 08:45.101
are the proof in this matter
that indeed,

08:45.167 --> 08:47.667
he is unable
to discharge his duties.

08:53.667 --> 08:56.568
All right,
time is of the essence,

08:56.633 --> 08:59.501
so unless there's an objection,
I would like to recess

08:59.568 --> 09:02.667
and then reconvene
for your vote in ten minutes.

09:23.634 --> 09:25.667
--Any word on the
Cabinet vote?

09:25.734 --> 09:27.934
No, they haven't
come back yet.

09:29.400 --> 09:32.801
Look, Milo,
about what happened today,

09:32.867 --> 09:34.567
let's just put it
behind us, okay?

09:34.634 --> 09:40.801
Oh, which part,
the suspicion of terrorism

09:40.867 --> 09:44.001
or the... the other thing?

09:44.068 --> 09:45.734
The suspicion.

09:45.801 --> 09:46.901
And the other thing?

09:46.968 --> 09:48.934
Let's not worry about it
right now.

09:49.001 --> 09:51.267
Let's try and get
through the day.

09:51.334 --> 09:53.434
Okay.

09:53.500 --> 09:57.567
I'm not going to
forget about the kiss,

09:57.634 --> 10:00.100
and I don't think
you are, either.

10:00.167 --> 10:02.734
(phone rings)

10:02.801 --> 10:04.068
Nadia.

10:04.133 --> 10:05.834
Nadia, it's Doyle.
Don't say my name,

10:05.901 --> 10:07.133
just listen.

10:07.200 --> 10:08.467
All right.

10:08.534 --> 10:10.001
Okay. I need you to come up
to my office right now

10:10.068 --> 10:12.334
and don't say anything
to anybody, just come.

10:12.400 --> 10:13.867
On my way.

10:16.701 --> 10:19.701
(sighs)

10:27.534 --> 10:28.667
Have a seat.

10:35.701 --> 10:38.734
Look, I know you and I
got off to kind of a bad start.

10:38.801 --> 10:40.767
A bad start?

10:40.834 --> 10:42.434
You assaulted me.

10:42.500 --> 10:45.334
This country is under attack
by Islamic terrorists.

10:45.400 --> 10:48.167
We had reason to believe there
was a mole in this building.

10:48.233 --> 10:49.734
Starting with you wasn't racist.

10:49.801 --> 10:51.167
It was common sense.

10:51.233 --> 10:53.601
Oh, okay, so you're not
a racist, you're just a sadist.

10:53.667 --> 10:55.334
You don't know me.

10:55.400 --> 10:57.068
I think I do.

10:58.500 --> 10:59.601
Why'd you call me here?

10:59.667 --> 11:01.267
It turns out
there was no mole.

11:01.334 --> 11:03.801
The terrorists were able
to hack into our system

11:03.867 --> 11:06.934
'cause someone screwed up
and logged the wrong

11:07.001 --> 11:08.001
security parameters.

11:08.068 --> 11:09.867
I'm pretty sure
that someone was Milo,

11:09.934 --> 11:11.734
and the proof
is on his computer.

11:11.801 --> 11:14.034
I need someone to get it
without him noticing.

11:14.100 --> 11:15.901
I can't do that.

11:15.968 --> 11:18.667
Why? Is it 'cause
you're too busy

11:18.734 --> 11:21.068
deciding if you want
to sleep with him?

11:22.634 --> 11:24.968
Listen, if you don't get
the evidence for me,

11:25.034 --> 11:27.634
I'm going to call a forensics
team, and they're going to come

11:27.701 --> 11:30.267
and tear his system apart
as the entire floor watches.

11:30.334 --> 11:33.233
And if they find what I think
they're going to find,
everyone gets to watch

11:33.300 --> 11:35.467
Milo hauled out of this building
in handcuffs.

11:35.534 --> 11:38.233
I'm sure it wasn't pleasant
when it happened to you.

11:38.300 --> 11:40.367
But you're going to stand by

11:40.434 --> 11:41.867
and watch it happen to him?

11:41.934 --> 11:43.901
That's your idea
of being a friend.

11:45.300 --> 11:48.500
So you want me to betray him
for his own good.

11:48.567 --> 11:50.601
I promise you,
Milo will be better off

11:50.667 --> 11:52.734
if you help me
than if you don't.

11:52.801 --> 11:55.068
Your call.

11:58.367 --> 11:59.634
If the Cabinet sides with you,

11:59.701 --> 12:01.167
what are you going to do
about Daniels?

12:01.233 --> 12:02.434
Unfortunately, Karen,

12:02.500 --> 12:03.767
the Constitution doesn't
allow the president

12:03.834 --> 12:05.934
to fire his
vice president.
No, but you can

12:06.001 --> 12:07.467
marginalize him.
Karen's right.

12:07.534 --> 12:10.267
Get him out of the bunker.
I would love to,
but Daniels has

12:10.334 --> 12:12.100
way too many supporters,
and I can't afford

12:12.167 --> 12:13.968
to alienate any one of them
right now.

12:14.034 --> 12:16.467
Besides, I'd rather
have him somewhere

12:16.534 --> 12:18.133
where I can keep an eye on him.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.434
Mr. President,

12:21.500 --> 12:23.334
the Cabinet's
reconvening.
Thank you.

12:23.400 --> 12:25.834
HAYES:
All right, let's go.

12:41.167 --> 12:43.534
Please, sit.

12:46.133 --> 12:48.167
All right,
ladies and gentlemen

12:48.233 --> 12:50.567
of the Cabinet,
let us now begin the vote.

12:50.634 --> 12:55.400
Will those of you who believe
that President Palmer <i>is</i> able

12:55.467 --> 12:57.300
to discharge his duties

12:57.367 --> 13:00.467
please, at this time,
raise your hand.

13:08.968 --> 13:10.968
Do we have any abstentions?

13:13.934 --> 13:17.167
Uh, the vote is seven to seven.

13:18.901 --> 13:20.867
LENNOX:
Mr. Attorney General,

13:20.934 --> 13:22.834
what would be the next step?

13:22.901 --> 13:26.068
Well, there's no need
for a next step.

13:26.133 --> 13:28.034
The amendment requires
that the vice president

13:28.100 --> 13:30.300
and a majority
of the Cabinet agree.

13:30.367 --> 13:32.534
There is no majority
in the Cabinet.

13:32.601 --> 13:33.934
It's split evenly.

13:34.001 --> 13:36.601
President Palmer
remains in office.

13:41.267 --> 13:43.400
NOAH:
It's not that simple--

13:43.467 --> 13:45.767
one of the Cabinet votes
is invalid.

13:45.834 --> 13:49.233
LENNOX:
Uh... sir,
wh-which vote is not valid?

13:49.300 --> 13:50.834
National Security Advisor.

13:50.901 --> 13:52.901
What are you
talking about?
She resigned.

13:52.968 --> 13:54.167
I resumed my duties.

13:54.233 --> 13:55.400
I don't agree.

13:55.467 --> 13:56.934
And I haven't seen
any evidence

13:57.001 --> 13:58.300
that you've been reinstated.

13:58.367 --> 14:00.867
That is ridiculous!
I sat here <i>with you</i>

14:00.934 --> 14:02.701
in a Cabinet meeting

14:02.767 --> 14:04.901
less than one hour ago!
Ms. Hayes,

14:04.968 --> 14:07.601
allowing you to sit in on
the meeting isn't the equivalent

14:07.667 --> 14:10.267
of formally recognizing you
as National Security Advisor.

14:10.334 --> 14:11.968
In fact, I did not

14:12.034 --> 14:13.434
and do not so recognize you.

14:13.500 --> 14:14.601
Oh, my God!

14:14.667 --> 14:18.133
And if Ms. Hayes'
vote is invalid,

14:18.200 --> 14:19.968
then the tally's seven to six

14:20.034 --> 14:23.400
in favor of invoking the
25th amendment and removing...

14:23.467 --> 14:25.601
President Palmer
from power.

14:27.233 --> 14:28.934
I'm sorry, Wayne.

14:30.601 --> 14:33.534
Noah, don't waste
your apologies on me,

14:33.601 --> 14:36.634
because I won't let you
steal the presidency.

14:36.701 --> 14:38.467
That's just not going to happen.

14:38.534 --> 14:41.068
And what do you suggest?
The country has to be governed.

14:41.133 --> 14:42.968
LENNOX:
Well, I would suggest,
sir, that this is

14:43.034 --> 14:44.400
properly a matter
for the courts.

14:44.467 --> 14:45.601
I concur.

14:45.667 --> 14:46.801
We don't have time to go to...

14:46.867 --> 14:48.167
GRAVES:
Mr. Vice President, if I may.

14:48.233 --> 14:52.667
I agree with Mr. Lennox--
this is a legal question.

14:52.734 --> 14:55.734
The Supreme Court
was in session this afternoon.

14:55.801 --> 14:59.500
We can recall it and have them
render a decision regarding

14:59.567 --> 15:00.901
the validity of the vote.

15:00.968 --> 15:03.500
The whole matter could be
resolved in well under an hour.

15:03.567 --> 15:04.801
Well, thank you,
Attorney General Graves.

15:04.867 --> 15:06.534
Why don't you simply
get the process started,

15:06.601 --> 15:08.467
and keep us advised
of your progress.

15:08.534 --> 15:09.634
Certainly.

15:09.701 --> 15:10.968
I think this meeting
is concluded.

15:20.500 --> 15:23.567
(quietly):
Get my affidavit started.

15:23.634 --> 15:25.367
Tom.

15:30.567 --> 15:32.267
You know something?

15:32.334 --> 15:35.233
I'm beginning to think
you're not on my side.

15:35.300 --> 15:38.701
Well, sir, I'm on the side
of the United States of America,

15:38.767 --> 15:40.567
and if you ever
thought otherwise,

15:40.634 --> 15:42.133
you were very much mistaken.

15:54.268 --> 15:57.201
--Gredenko's attorney approved
the immunity agreements.

15:57.268 --> 16:00.334
Yeah, we're just waiting
for digital signatures.

16:00.400 --> 16:02.167
All right.

16:02.234 --> 16:03.700
I'll inform the attorney
general's office

16:03.767 --> 16:04.834
it's on its way.

16:04.901 --> 16:06.400
Thank you.

16:07.467 --> 16:08.634
Milo.

16:08.700 --> 16:10.400
What's up?
I'm having a problem

16:10.467 --> 16:12.201
with my station--
it keeps telling me

16:12.268 --> 16:13.700
to refresh
the system credentials.

16:13.767 --> 16:14.967
Uh, it's the
hardware codes.

16:15.034 --> 16:17.268
You have to reset them
in the machine room.

16:17.334 --> 16:20.134
I can take care of it.
Thanks.

16:21.433 --> 16:22.700
You okay?

16:22.767 --> 16:24.334
Yeah.
(laughs softly)

16:55.934 --> 16:57.500
Well, you were right.

16:57.567 --> 16:59.967
Milo forgot to refresh
the security parameters.

17:00.034 --> 17:01.334
The breach <i>was</i> his fault.

17:01.400 --> 17:02.934
So when you tell District,

17:03.001 --> 17:05.067
they can fire and maybe
even arrest him.

17:05.134 --> 17:06.367
Which is why
I'm going

17:06.433 --> 17:08.166
to alter the logs so
they'll never know.

17:09.433 --> 17:11.201
(sighs):
This should work,

17:11.268 --> 17:13.733
as long as they haven't
changed the password.

17:18.532 --> 17:19.934
(beep)

17:20.001 --> 17:22.567
There. It's done.

17:22.634 --> 17:24.034
Why'd you do that?

17:24.101 --> 17:27.034
'Cause all I care about
is finding those nukes,

17:27.101 --> 17:29.901
and we have a better chance of
doing that with Milo on board,

17:29.967 --> 17:31.400
whether he likes me or not.

17:33.201 --> 17:37.368
"And mankind was naught
by a single nation."

17:37.433 --> 17:40.533
You've read the Koran.

17:40.600 --> 17:42.400
Yeah, and the Bible
and the Upanishads.

17:42.467 --> 17:44.500
Anything I can get my hands on.

17:44.567 --> 17:46.600
You're lucky--

17:46.667 --> 17:47.734
you found your answers.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.433
I'm looking for mine.

17:50.500 --> 17:52.901
I'm going to get ready
to deploy.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.334
What did Doyle want?

18:22.400 --> 18:25.368
Nothing. We were just
reviewing some data sets.

18:28.767 --> 18:32.901
Oh, your... system's back up.

18:32.967 --> 18:34.667
Thanks.

18:53.734 --> 18:55.934
(phone rings)

18:56.001 --> 18:57.167
Buchanan.

18:57.234 --> 18:58.901
HAYES:
Hi. It's me.

18:58.967 --> 19:01.134
Hey, how did
the Cabinet vote go?

19:01.201 --> 19:03.101
It was a tie, which, in effect,

19:03.167 --> 19:05.067
means that Palmer's
still in office.

19:05.134 --> 19:06.901
Good, that's good.
That's what we wanted.

19:06.967 --> 19:09.067
Yes, well, Daniels is
contesting the vote.

19:09.134 --> 19:10.867
He's saying that
mine is invalid.

19:10.934 --> 19:12.167
Based on what?

19:12.234 --> 19:14.001
Based on the fact
that I resigned,

19:14.067 --> 19:15.767
and I was never
officially reinstated.

19:15.834 --> 19:17.167
That's ridiculous.

19:17.234 --> 19:20.067
You attended Cabinet meetings;
you had no replacement assigned.

19:20.134 --> 19:23.467
How does he explain that?
I know, but maybe
he's right, Bill.

19:23.533 --> 19:25.767
I did hand in my resignation.

19:25.834 --> 19:28.201
Which was rescinded before
it was officially accepted.

19:28.268 --> 19:29.667
Daniels knows that.

19:29.734 --> 19:31.667
He's grasping at straws, Karen.

19:31.734 --> 19:33.101
I'm so scared, Bill.

19:33.167 --> 19:36.667
If he wins...
this will all be my fault.

19:36.734 --> 19:39.500
Stop, stop.

19:39.567 --> 19:42.134
It's desperate maneuvering
on his part,

19:42.201 --> 19:43.634
Karen, nothing more.

19:43.700 --> 19:45.600
He hasn't got a case.

19:45.667 --> 19:47.934
And the Supreme Court
will agree.

19:49.500 --> 19:51.767
Well, we're giving our arguments
in 15 minutes.

19:51.834 --> 19:54.734
Call me as soon
as the decision is in.

19:54.800 --> 19:57.567
Thank you for being there.

19:57.634 --> 19:59.700
You don't have to thank me.

19:59.767 --> 20:01.533
It's my job.

20:01.600 --> 20:04.400
(laughs)

20:04.467 --> 20:06.567
I miss you so much.

20:06.634 --> 20:09.201
I miss you, too.

20:09.268 --> 20:10.734
I'll talk to you soon.

20:10.800 --> 20:12.734
Bye.

20:13.800 --> 20:16.101
(long sigh)

20:19.500 --> 20:22.234
(Gredenko speaking Russian)

20:22.301 --> 20:23.901
(man speaks Russian over phone)

20:23.967 --> 20:26.268
 <i>Dasvidanya.</i>

20:26.334 --> 20:27.600
(snaps cell phone shut)

20:27.667 --> 20:31.201
Good. My attorney
has verified the agreements.

20:31.268 --> 20:32.467
Bill, we're set.

20:32.533 --> 20:34.134
Gredenko's ready
to make the call.

20:34.201 --> 20:36.134
All right, Jack,
we're standing by.

20:36.201 --> 20:38.567
Doyle's got a team ready to go
as soon as Fayed tells Gredenko

20:38.634 --> 20:39.834
where to meet him.
Copy that.

20:39.901 --> 20:41.201
You try and warn Fayed

20:41.268 --> 20:43.901
with anything you say
or how you say it,

20:43.967 --> 20:46.101
and I will kill you
right here right now.

20:46.167 --> 20:48.101
I believe you, Agent Bauer.

20:49.700 --> 20:51.634
Make the call.

20:57.901 --> 21:00.101
(phone rings)

21:01.134 --> 21:02.268
Yes?

21:02.334 --> 21:03.600
It's me.

21:03.667 --> 21:06.201
Do you have the security
protocols for the power plant?

21:06.268 --> 21:07.201
Yes.

21:07.268 --> 21:08.934
Where do you want to meet?

21:09.001 --> 21:10.634
Are you certain
you're not under surveillance?

21:10.700 --> 21:12.034
Of course.

21:12.101 --> 21:14.368
Do you think I'd be
calling you otherwise?

21:14.433 --> 21:16.368
I can't allow another
one of your mistakes

21:16.433 --> 21:18.634
to disrupt my plans
for the remaining two devices.

21:18.700 --> 21:20.867
Do you want
the protocols or not?

21:20.934 --> 21:22.500
Where are you right now?

21:22.567 --> 21:24.368
Culver City.

21:24.433 --> 21:27.268
Meet me at the Santa Monica Pier
in ten minutes.

21:27.334 --> 21:30.533
GREDENKO:
Um, it may take me more time.

21:30.600 --> 21:31.834
I won't wait.

21:31.901 --> 21:33.334
Where do I find you?

21:33.400 --> 21:35.001
Just be there.

21:35.067 --> 21:37.634
I'll find you.

21:39.901 --> 21:41.500
Give him the phone.

21:41.567 --> 21:43.800
Bill, how long will
it take Doyle's team

21:43.867 --> 21:45.067
to make it to the pier?

21:45.134 --> 21:46.567
He's about 30 minutes out, Jack.

21:46.634 --> 21:48.067
We'll make due with Ryan's team.

21:48.134 --> 21:49.734
Put him in the vehicle.

21:56.600 --> 21:59.400
Instructions from
the Supreme Court.

21:59.467 --> 22:01.301
Our arguments have
to be submitted in writing,

22:01.368 --> 22:03.101
in the next ten minutes.

22:03.167 --> 22:04.500
Sandra's working
on our brief.

22:04.567 --> 22:06.800
How's it coming?

22:06.867 --> 22:09.234
I'm just about finished.

22:09.301 --> 22:11.134
We have a strong case.

22:11.201 --> 22:13.101
You resigned, and Daniels

22:13.167 --> 22:15.201
was in charge
when you returned,

22:15.268 --> 22:16.334
so the legal question is,

22:16.400 --> 22:18.301
did he consent
to your reinstatement?

22:18.368 --> 22:19.767
Of course he did.

22:19.834 --> 22:22.334
And he made no objections when
you returned to the bunker,

22:22.400 --> 22:23.901
you sat in his
first Cabinet meeting,

22:23.967 --> 22:26.201
and he never questioned
your right to be there?

22:26.268 --> 22:27.400
No, he didn't.

22:27.467 --> 22:31.368
His own actions
prove our case.

22:31.433 --> 22:35.234
Thank you...
for everything, Sandra.

22:39.334 --> 22:41.767
My affidavit explains
everything--

22:41.834 --> 22:44.667
that I never really intended
to reinstate Karen,

22:44.734 --> 22:46.700
I was only allowing her
to perform her duties

22:46.767 --> 22:49.067
temporarily, therefore,
she had no authority

22:49.134 --> 22:52.001
to cast a vote
under the 25th amendment.

22:52.067 --> 22:53.967
The problem is,
after Karen returned,

22:54.034 --> 22:57.234
you treated her
as if she were still
National Security Advisor.

22:57.301 --> 23:00.400
It's really a question of my
state of mind, though, isn't it?

23:00.467 --> 23:02.334
Yes. And your state of mind

23:02.400 --> 23:03.934
will be inferred
from your actions.

23:04.001 --> 23:11.034
Doesn't sounds like you think
our chances are very good.

23:11.101 --> 23:13.700
I don't.

23:13.767 --> 23:19.334
Then I am... deeply afraid
for our country.

23:22.301 --> 23:23.934
When the world sees
that Wayne Palmer

23:24.001 --> 23:28.201
isn't willing to fight back,
our enemies will be encouraged.

23:28.268 --> 23:29.400
These recent attacks will be

23:29.467 --> 23:31.600
just the beginning.

23:31.667 --> 23:35.334
America will be vulnerable
in a way it never has been.

23:38.734 --> 23:41.634
There may be a way

23:41.700 --> 23:46.667
to illuminate your state
of mind more explicitly.

23:54.600 --> 23:57.134
I can swear an affidavit
that, earlier today,

23:57.201 --> 23:59.301
you told me to
inform Karen Hayes

23:59.368 --> 24:01.034
you had no intention
of reinstating her.

24:01.101 --> 24:03.101
But that you were
going to allow her
to perform her duties

24:03.167 --> 24:05.533
on a temporary basis only.

24:05.600 --> 24:06.867
Then Wayne regained
consciousness

24:06.934 --> 24:08.433
before I could have
that conversation with her.

24:08.500 --> 24:12.967
Lisa, you're talking
about perjuring yourself

24:13.034 --> 24:14.368
in front of the Supreme Court.

24:14.433 --> 24:18.368
I'm aware that
it's perjury,

24:18.433 --> 24:23.268
but the end
justifies the means.

24:23.334 --> 24:25.234
My affidavit will
push the court to
rule in your favor

24:25.301 --> 24:28.800
so that you can
do what's right
for this country.

24:33.800 --> 24:35.500
You're right.

24:38.767 --> 24:41.500
Do it.

24:41.567 --> 24:44.901
Prepare your affidavit.

24:50.167 --> 24:52.101
And, Lisa...

24:54.034 --> 24:55.734
...thank you.

24:58.967 --> 25:00.433
Yes, sir.

25:18.334 --> 25:22.334
Kasim, Hassan, with me.

25:22.400 --> 25:24.433
I'm meeting Gredenko.
I'll be back within the hour.

25:24.500 --> 25:26.867
And if you're not?

25:30.400 --> 25:32.101
Are you worried for me, Halil,

25:32.167 --> 25:34.400
or just anxious
to take my place?

25:34.467 --> 25:37.067
I think we're wasting time.

25:37.134 --> 25:39.700
We have the bombs.
We should use them right now.

25:39.767 --> 25:41.667
Gredenko's information 
will enable us

25:41.734 --> 25:43.867
to inflict damage
across half of California.

25:43.934 --> 25:45.400
There's other target out there

25:45.467 --> 25:47.533
that will result
in large amount of casualties

25:47.600 --> 25:49.600
without the additional risk.

25:49.667 --> 25:52.533
I've made my decision.

25:55.700 --> 25:58.600
Let's go.

26:11.234 --> 26:12.700
Come in.

26:16.700 --> 26:18.134
Mr. Vice President,

26:18.201 --> 26:20.334
I need to speak with you alone.

26:32.700 --> 26:37.467
There is something in this room
you need to know about, sir.

26:37.533 --> 26:39.433
Something in this room?

26:39.500 --> 26:41.467
What are you
talking about?

26:44.001 --> 26:46.667
This small object here

26:46.734 --> 26:48.368
is a microtransmitter.

26:50.400 --> 26:52.800
After you directed me
to lie to the ambassador

26:52.867 --> 26:54.800
about the attempted
assassination,

26:54.867 --> 26:58.734
I decided it was time
to protect myself.

26:58.800 --> 27:01.800
Now it turns out I was
protecting the country as well.

27:01.867 --> 27:05.234
Be careful, Tom.

27:05.301 --> 27:08.134
Be very careful
what you try to do here.

27:08.201 --> 27:13.034
Actually, sir, you are the one
who needs to be careful here.

27:13.101 --> 27:19.700
LISA:
I'm aware that it's perjury,
but the end justifies the means.

27:19.767 --> 27:22.067
My affidavit will push the court
to rule in your favor

27:22.134 --> 27:25.201
so that you can do what's right
for this country.

27:25.268 --> 27:27.901
NOAH:
You're right.

27:27.967 --> 27:29.567
Do it.

27:29.634 --> 27:31.101
Prepare your affidavit.

27:31.167 --> 27:33.800
Turn it off.

27:33.867 --> 27:38.368
As I'm sure you're aware, sir,
conspiracy to commit perjury

27:38.433 --> 27:40.867
is a felony offense.

27:40.934 --> 27:42.667
Now, I strongly urge you

27:42.734 --> 27:46.234
to pick up that phone
and call the Supreme Court

27:46.301 --> 27:49.001
and tell them that you have
withdrawn your affidavit,

27:49.067 --> 27:51.433
and that of
Ms. Miller as well.

27:51.500 --> 27:54.067
Tell them that you support
the vote of the Cabinet.

27:54.134 --> 27:55.334
That you have
no further objections

27:55.400 --> 27:57.834
to President Palmer
continuing his presidency.

27:57.901 --> 28:01.767
You do understand
that I'm just trying

28:01.834 --> 28:03.368
to do what's right
for this country.

28:03.433 --> 28:06.433
Well, so am I, sir.

28:25.700 --> 28:26.900
--Karen, I need
the launch protocols

28:26.967 --> 28:28.767
the Joint Chiefs set up
with Vice President Daniels

28:28.834 --> 28:31.134
along with chain
of command signing.

28:31.201 --> 28:32.568
They just came over
from the Pentagon.

28:32.633 --> 28:34.733
Everything is in place.

28:34.800 --> 28:37.134
If the court sides with you,
you can cancel the strike

28:37.201 --> 28:38.700
permanently.

28:38.767 --> 28:40.700
I also need want an update
on the situation with Fayed.

28:40.767 --> 28:42.201
(hoarsely):
Has CTU made any progress?

28:42.267 --> 28:43.434
Yes, they have
Gredenko in custody.

28:43.501 --> 28:45.000
The last time I talked to Bill,

28:45.067 --> 28:47.267
they said they were going
to use him to lure Fayed

28:47.334 --> 28:48.267
out in the open.

28:48.334 --> 28:49.267
Who's running it?

28:49.334 --> 28:50.733
Jack Bauer.

28:50.800 --> 28:52.401
Good.
SANDRA:
Wayne.

28:52.468 --> 28:54.067
The Supreme Court
was just notified

28:54.134 --> 28:56.434
Daniels withdrew his suit.

28:56.501 --> 28:58.134
What?
It's over.

28:58.201 --> 28:59.633
He gave up before the
court had a chance

28:59.700 --> 29:01.101
to make its decision.

29:01.167 --> 29:03.000
Why?

29:03.067 --> 29:04.000
I don't know.

29:04.067 --> 29:05.234
I just know
that you're still

29:05.301 --> 29:07.633
the President of
the United States.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.067
(breathing heavily)

29:15.134 --> 29:18.000
Let the Cabinet know
I won't take any action 

29:18.067 --> 29:20.201
against those who sided
with the vice president.

29:20.267 --> 29:22.234
Yes, sir.

29:22.301 --> 29:23.800
Oh, and, Karen,

29:23.867 --> 29:26.633
tell Bill I want him to keep me
up to date on CTU's progress.

29:36.401 --> 29:40.633
(breathing heavily)

29:40.700 --> 29:42.733
Melinda.

29:42.800 --> 29:45.501
Tell Dr. Welton I need
to see him, please.

29:45.568 --> 29:48.267
I don't have a visual yet,

29:48.334 --> 29:50.468
but Fayed won't show himself
until he sees Gredenko.

29:50.534 --> 29:51.501
BUCHANAN:
Understood. Ryan,

29:51.568 --> 29:52.867
what's your status
with Gredenko?

29:52.934 --> 29:54.501
RYAN:
I've got
the audio transmitter set up.

29:54.568 --> 29:57.468
I'm preparing
the tracker now.

29:57.534 --> 29:59.468
Roll up your left sleeve.

29:59.534 --> 30:00.934
JACK:
What's its range?

30:01.000 --> 30:03.301
We can track the isotope's
signature up to 15 miles.

30:03.367 --> 30:05.568
Copy that.

30:05.667 --> 30:06.867
(winces)

30:06.934 --> 30:08.733
Is it radioactive?

30:08.800 --> 30:09.800
Yes.

30:11.034 --> 30:13.034
It penetrates
into the bone.

30:13.101 --> 30:15.134
It's got a half-life
of about 11 hours,

30:15.201 --> 30:17.633
so you can forget about
trying to dig it out
or making a run for it.

30:17.700 --> 30:19.568
He's good to go.
JACK: Bill.

30:19.633 --> 30:21.167
How far out is Doyle's team?

30:21.234 --> 30:22.468
About 20 minutes.

30:22.534 --> 30:23.568
We can't wait.

30:23.633 --> 30:26.301
Fayed was clear
about his timeline.

30:26.367 --> 30:27.301
Ryan,

30:27.367 --> 30:28.600
send in Gredenko.

30:28.667 --> 30:31.201
Gredenko's moving now.

30:40.267 --> 30:41.568
CHLOE: I'm getting
a clean audio signal

30:41.633 --> 30:44.900
from the transmitter
on Gredenko.

30:44.967 --> 30:46.767
And we are locked
on the isotope signature

30:46.834 --> 30:50.034
that's being emitted
from Gredenko's arm.

31:12.234 --> 31:13.867
(phone ringing)

31:26.501 --> 31:28.867
Hello.

31:28.934 --> 31:30.700
Hello?

31:30.767 --> 31:32.800
I have the gain on Gredenko's
transmitter up all the way.

31:32.867 --> 31:34.633
There's no one
on the other end of the call.

31:39.101 --> 31:40.733
He's reading something
off his phone.

31:40.800 --> 31:42.234
It's a text message.

31:42.301 --> 31:43.301
Fayed's made contact.

31:43.367 --> 31:44.367
Everyone get ready.

31:46.367 --> 31:48.967
Gredenko is heading south.

31:50.667 --> 31:53.334
Milo, have you got him
on the tracker?

31:53.401 --> 31:55.167
Yeah, he's still moving.

31:56.967 --> 31:58.134
I'm heading in.

31:58.201 --> 32:00.301
I'm going to follow him.

32:26.867 --> 32:29.867
* *

33:01.568 --> 33:02.568
I've lost audio signal.

33:02.633 --> 33:04.134
I'm going to secondary channel.

33:04.201 --> 33:06.700
There's no audio
on the secondary channel.

33:07.733 --> 33:09.900
But he hasn't moved.

33:11.767 --> 33:13.934
I don't like it.
Something's wrong.

33:15.434 --> 33:17.167
You led them to me.

33:17.234 --> 33:19.067
I had no choice.

33:20.468 --> 33:22.700
But if you listen to me,

33:22.767 --> 33:25.367
we'll both get
away from here alive.

33:25.434 --> 33:27.101
Kasim.

33:43.201 --> 33:44.434
Which direction, Milo?

33:44.501 --> 33:46.434
I'm nearing the south end
of the pier.

33:46.501 --> 33:47.468
That's where he stopped

33:47.534 --> 33:49.468
and entered the building
on the left.

34:04.568 --> 34:05.967
Is he still inside the room?

34:07.568 --> 34:09.667
Yes, he's right on the other
side of the door.

34:10.600 --> 34:11.699
I'm going in.

34:15.534 --> 34:17.400
Milo, no one's in here.

34:18.733 --> 34:20.333
Jack! The tracker's
showing the signal

34:20.400 --> 34:22.067
right there
in the same room with you.

34:33.833 --> 34:35.568
My God.

34:35.632 --> 34:36.632
He cut off Gredenko's arm.

34:36.699 --> 34:38.667
Ryan, move your men in now!

34:38.733 --> 34:40.067
RYAN:
Roger that. Let's go.

34:43.534 --> 34:44.501
Hold on.

34:44.568 --> 34:47.534
I've picked up his blood trail.

34:48.733 --> 34:50.000
Fayed,

34:50.067 --> 34:53.167
their men will be coming
from the west side parking lot.

34:55.234 --> 34:57.201
We should go this way.

34:59.067 --> 35:01.401
Ryan, have your men circle back
to the east side of the pier.

35:01.468 --> 35:02.401
Try and cut them off.

35:15.868 --> 35:17.334
--Ryan, have you got anything?
Negative.

35:17.401 --> 35:18.434
How far out
is Doyle's team?

35:18.501 --> 35:19.434
20 minutes.

35:19.501 --> 35:20.701
Have him set up a perimeter

35:20.768 --> 35:22.167
as soon as he gets here.

35:36.701 --> 35:37.967
Ryan, where are you?!

35:38.033 --> 35:39.134
I'm pinned down!

35:39.200 --> 35:40.734
Moving towards
you now.

35:46.801 --> 35:48.033
Show me your head.

35:59.734 --> 36:01.167
TV REPORTER:
But sources indicate that

36:01.234 --> 36:03.067
the same terrorist
cell is most likely

36:03.134 --> 36:05.734
responsible for the nuclear
explosion in Valencia...

36:05.801 --> 36:06.734
We're trapped.

36:06.801 --> 36:09.067
This way.

36:10.601 --> 36:11.567
That's him.

36:13.567 --> 36:14.768
I recognize him
from the news.

36:14.834 --> 36:18.033
He's the terrorist
they're looking for.

36:20.401 --> 36:21.933
MAN:
That <i>is</i> him.

36:22.000 --> 36:22.967
You bastard.

36:38.434 --> 36:39.701
Federal agent!
(two gunshots)

36:39.768 --> 36:41.100
I am a federal agent!

36:41.167 --> 36:42.701
I'm taking
this man into custody.

36:42.768 --> 36:43.768
Now, back off!

36:43.834 --> 36:45.200
Back off!

36:45.267 --> 36:46.401
He shot my friend.

36:46.467 --> 36:47.667
I'm sorry about your friend.

36:47.734 --> 36:49.267
We'll get him medical attention.
Just stay back.

36:49.334 --> 36:51.667
I hope your friend is dead.
Shut up!

36:52.933 --> 36:53.967
Everybody out
of the bar now!

36:54.033 --> 36:55.200
Move!

36:57.300 --> 36:58.667
Gredenko is not here.

36:58.734 --> 37:00.601
I need you to lock down the
area and initiate a search.

37:00.667 --> 37:02.033
We have two men down.

37:02.100 --> 37:04.234
One is a civilian, the other
is Fayed. He's in custody.

37:04.300 --> 37:06.334
I need Medical
up here <i>now.</i>

37:06.401 --> 37:07.801
All right, Jack. Good work.

37:07.868 --> 37:09.900
Nadia, get me the president,
please.

37:17.334 --> 37:18.601
I understand you're weak.

37:18.667 --> 37:20.501
Another dose of
adrenaline will raise

37:20.567 --> 37:22.267
your blood pressure
levels even higher,

37:22.334 --> 37:24.334
to the point where we know
there'll be vascular damage.

37:24.401 --> 37:26.467
And that's a risk
I'm willing to take.

37:26.534 --> 37:27.801
Your well-being
is my responsibility.

37:27.868 --> 37:29.900
And my responsibility, Doctor,

37:29.967 --> 37:31.300
is to the well-being
of this country.

37:31.367 --> 37:33.267
So give me another dose
so I can go back

37:33.334 --> 37:36.134
to doing my job or I will find
someone else who will.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.634
MELINDA:
Mr. President,

37:49.701 --> 37:51.534
Bill Buchanan is on line one.

37:53.200 --> 37:54.634
I'll take it.

38:00.534 --> 38:02.167
Thank you, Arthur.

38:03.234 --> 38:05.434
Yes, sir.

38:15.100 --> 38:16.033
Bill.

38:16.100 --> 38:17.267
Mr. President, I'm calling

38:17.334 --> 38:19.467
to tell you that Jack
has Fayed in custody.

38:19.534 --> 38:20.801
What about the bombs?

38:20.868 --> 38:22.801
We haven't finished
the radiological scan yet,

38:22.868 --> 38:25.067
so we can't confirm the bombs
are in the immediate vicinity.

38:25.134 --> 38:27.634
Jack is going to interrogate
Fayed as soon as possible.

38:27.701 --> 38:29.933
But there's no way of knowing
how long that will take

38:30.000 --> 38:31.567
or how successful
that will be, right?

38:31.634 --> 38:32.567
No, sir.

38:32.634 --> 38:33.634
All right, Bill.

38:33.701 --> 38:35.601
That's what I wanted to know.

38:35.667 --> 38:36.634
Thank you, sir.

39:33.534 --> 39:35.334
But since the case
was withdrawn,

39:35.401 --> 39:37.601
the court has no reason
to retain the documents.

39:37.667 --> 39:40.200
They should be sealed
and returned to me immediately.

39:40.267 --> 39:41.567
Okay. Good. Thank you.

39:46.267 --> 39:48.667
I was thinking
that maybe

39:48.734 --> 39:51.367
it's time to
declare a truce.

39:53.100 --> 39:55.434
Okay. Well... maybe it is.

39:55.501 --> 39:57.900
You know, we both want the
same thing for this country--

39:57.967 --> 40:00.033
what's good for the country.

40:00.100 --> 40:02.734
We just don't always
agree on the means.

40:02.801 --> 40:06.801
I would love to go forward
without the threats

40:06.868 --> 40:08.267
and the intimidation.

40:10.967 --> 40:12.300
Done.

40:12.367 --> 40:14.167
Good.

40:14.234 --> 40:15.401
One more thing.

40:15.467 --> 40:17.334
Do you know why
the vice president

40:17.401 --> 40:19.267
withdrew his suit
from the Supreme Court?

40:20.701 --> 40:22.834
No. I have no idea. Why?

40:22.900 --> 40:24.834
Well, one of
my aides saw you

40:24.900 --> 40:27.000
with him before
it was announced.

40:27.067 --> 40:30.601
I... I guess just put this down
to happy coincidence.

40:30.667 --> 40:32.734
For now.

40:32.801 --> 40:34.868
But someday I'd love to know
the realstory.

40:34.933 --> 40:37.000
Okay. Some day.
(phone rings)

40:37.067 --> 40:39.033
Lennox.

40:42.834 --> 40:44.401
He...

40:44.467 --> 40:47.534
This cannot be,
this has got to be some mistake.

40:47.601 --> 40:49.634
I'm on my way.

40:49.701 --> 40:51.634
President Palmer.
What?

40:51.701 --> 40:54.701
He's about to go ahead
with the nuclear strike.

40:59.401 --> 41:00.967
Mr. President.

41:02.434 --> 41:04.401
If I may, sir.

41:04.467 --> 41:08.300
I understand you're about
to launch the very strike

41:08.367 --> 41:10.801
we just prevented Vice President
Daniels from launching.

41:10.868 --> 41:11.967
That's right.

41:12.033 --> 41:14.334
This makes no sense, sir.

41:14.401 --> 41:16.634
I mean it's what
you risked your life to stop.

41:16.701 --> 41:19.467
Tom, I risked my life
to reassert my authority.

41:20.967 --> 41:22.933
I've got Vice President Daniels
calling me weak.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.033
Even you thought the same thing.

41:25.100 --> 41:26.200
I implore you, sir,

41:26.267 --> 41:28.467
do not mistake being reckless
with being strong.

41:28.534 --> 41:30.100
Tom, I am done talking.

41:30.167 --> 41:31.401
Mr. President.

41:32.734 --> 41:34.000
We have a successful launch.

41:34.067 --> 41:35.434
Good.

41:35.434 --> 41:40.434
