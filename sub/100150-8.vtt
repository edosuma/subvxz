WEBVTT

00:24.775 --> 00:26.986
(quiet chatter)

00:31.782 --> 00:35.411
We expect that our treaty
with the Reich

00:35.453 --> 00:36.996
will be honored

00:37.037 --> 00:40.040
as we withdraw
from this territory.

00:41.292 --> 00:44.044
We have no plans to interfere.

00:45.880 --> 00:48.257
Tell me, Admiral, this...

00:48.299 --> 00:52.803
new Negro government--

00:52.845 --> 00:55.222
will they be taking control
of any part

00:55.264 --> 00:59.018
of the JPS's nuclear arsenal?

00:59.059 --> 01:03.272
The Empire does not recognize
the Black Communist Rebellion.

01:03.314 --> 01:07.610
Our weapons will return
to Japan.

01:07.651 --> 01:11.071
So the BCR has no alliance,
no protectorate.

01:11.113 --> 01:15.701
The Empire is concerned
only with the flow of oil.

01:15.743 --> 01:19.789
If the Reich can guarantee it
at favorable prices,

01:19.830 --> 01:23.334
then what happens here
after we are gone

01:23.375 --> 01:25.961
is of no concern to us.

01:26.003 --> 01:29.340
I'm sure a price
can be arranged.

01:40.351 --> 01:44.688
KIDO:
These two empires
that we fight for,

01:44.730 --> 01:47.691
they are little more
than sandcastles.

01:48.901 --> 01:51.487
Only the tides are forever.

01:52.530 --> 01:55.324
Well, even so.

01:55.366 --> 01:57.326
Mind if I ask you a question?

01:57.368 --> 01:58.869
Hmm.

01:59.995 --> 02:02.081
This, uh, BCR,

02:02.122 --> 02:06.293
I'm sure you have extensive
intelligence files on them.

02:06.335 --> 02:07.962
Whereabouts.

02:08.003 --> 02:11.382
-Personnel.
-All destroyed now.

02:13.425 --> 02:16.303
Shame.

02:16.345 --> 02:18.514
Well...

02:18.556 --> 02:20.641
goodbye, Colonel.

02:20.683 --> 02:23.561
-Goodbye, Reichsmarschall.
-Good luck.

Attention. Attention.

(speaking Japanese
over loudspeaker)

03:55.945 --> 03:57.655
All Japanese citizens

03:57.696 --> 04:00.574
-must register for evacuation.
-(horns honking)

04:00.616 --> 04:02.618
(speaking Japanese
over loudspeaker)

04:07.581 --> 04:10.250
Please make your way
to the docks.

04:10.292 --> 04:13.796
The final ships will depart
in 72 hours.

04:13.837 --> 04:15.839
(speaking Japanese
over loudspeaker)

04:21.845 --> 04:25.265
We repeat, all Japanese
citizens must make...

04:30.270 --> 04:32.606
Attention. Attention.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.572
Any news?

04:40.614 --> 04:42.491
Colonel Kido. No, sir.

04:42.533 --> 04:44.743
Your son has not registered
for evacuation, yet.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.704
Keep searching.

05:12.938 --> 05:15.441
You're off the drugs, I'm told.

05:16.483 --> 05:18.110
How long?

05:18.152 --> 05:20.863
Two days.

05:20.904 --> 05:23.115
Not long.

05:24.158 --> 05:26.577
I've come to settle my debts.

05:26.618 --> 05:28.746
Sit.

05:28.787 --> 05:30.789
Here.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.300
Drugs cost money.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.678
You ran up a great debt
these past weeks.

05:44.720 --> 05:47.514
If there is a debt to be paid,

05:47.556 --> 05:49.516
I will pay it myself.

05:49.558 --> 05:52.227
And how do you plan to do that?

05:52.269 --> 05:56.023
If you need me to do something,
I will do it.

05:56.065 --> 05:58.025
If you need me...

05:58.067 --> 06:01.779
if you need me to kill someone,
I will do it.

06:01.820 --> 06:03.614
I know you can kill.

06:03.655 --> 06:07.910
But I already have men
who can kill.

06:07.951 --> 06:10.370
Your services
have no value to me.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.749
But your father does.

06:13.791 --> 06:15.501
He can help you.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.252
If you brought him to me...

06:17.294 --> 06:19.421
No!

06:20.464 --> 06:22.424
(sighs)

06:22.466 --> 06:25.260
I can afford to be patient.

06:25.302 --> 06:29.139
You see, you are my collateral.

06:30.182 --> 06:32.434
Two days.

06:32.476 --> 06:34.353
Not too long at all.

06:34.394 --> 06:38.982
You know, you always have
good credit with us. Hmm?

06:53.330 --> 06:55.582
(man speaking Japanese
over loudspeaker)

07:04.133 --> 07:06.093
Teitoku.

07:09.138 --> 07:11.140
Taisa.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.478
We have set up a marine cordon
around the docks...

07:16.520 --> 07:18.522
to oversee the evacuation.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.734
The last ships are leaving
for the homeland.

07:26.488 --> 07:30.284
Your men must be aboard them.

07:30.325 --> 07:32.786
Bands of gaijin vigilantes
are out in the streets...

07:32.828 --> 07:34.413
looking for revenge
on innocent Japanese.

07:35.497 --> 07:37.624
(sighs)

07:37.666 --> 07:38.834
I've heard.

07:38.876 --> 07:40.794
My men are keeping the peace.

07:40.836 --> 07:42.963
It is our city...

07:43.005 --> 07:44.840
and our duty.

07:46.175 --> 07:47.801
In a few days...

07:47.843 --> 07:49.469
it will be our city no longer.

07:51.972 --> 07:55.225
There will be more vigilantes
here than Kempeitai.

08:00.939 --> 08:03.442
I will be on one of those ships.

08:06.862 --> 08:09.406
I expect you on one, too.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.796
CAROLINE:
Tell me a story, Hawthorne.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.424
ABENDSEN:
What kind of story
would you like to hear?

08:27.466 --> 08:30.844
CAROLINE:
Tell me a story
about another world.

08:30.886 --> 08:34.973
I only know what I've seen
through my little Moviola.

08:35.974 --> 08:38.393
Tell me what you've seen, then.

08:40.103 --> 08:43.732
In all those films
you've watched over the years.

08:43.774 --> 08:45.943
Were we in any of them?

08:45.984 --> 08:47.986
Only this one.

08:53.742 --> 08:55.577
Well, then...

08:55.619 --> 08:58.872
that just makes our love here...

08:58.914 --> 09:00.874
very rare.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.877
I always thought so.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.714
Maybe we've yet to meet
each other

09:07.756 --> 09:10.259
in those other worlds.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.886
Where would I find you?

09:12.928 --> 09:15.931
At the Odeon, of course.

09:19.601 --> 09:21.645
You bought me that popcorn.

09:21.687 --> 09:24.606
How was I to know
you hated popcorn?

09:24.648 --> 09:28.402
I didn't have the heart
to tell you for-for years.

09:28.443 --> 09:30.445
-(chuckles)
-Mm-hmm.

09:50.966 --> 09:53.385
I'll see you at the movies.

10:00.642 --> 10:03.520
(elevator whirs, clunks)

10:03.562 --> 10:06.440
MAN:
You saw what just happened
in the JPS.

10:06.481 --> 10:08.275
WOMAN:
Baby, I think you've just had
enough to drink.

10:08.317 --> 10:10.193
MAN:
Oh, one day, an empire.
The next...

10:10.235 --> 10:12.237
WOMAN:
Ugh, I get nervous
when you talk like this.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.281
MAN:
Oh, these Negroes blow up
a couple of tankers

10:14.323 --> 10:15.949
-and pipelines.
-Oh, shh, shh, shh.

10:15.991 --> 10:17.868
It all collapses
just like a house of cards.

10:17.909 --> 10:20.037
-(woman sighs)
-You think it
can't happen here?

10:20.078 --> 10:22.372
-Thousand-Year Reich, my ass.
-All right, turn it off.

10:22.414 --> 10:24.458
-I get the idea.
-Nothing lasts forever.
Nothing.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.089
He drinks.

10:31.131 --> 10:34.092
For a commanding officer,
it's no excuse.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.053
We'll take care of him.

10:36.094 --> 10:38.889
But there are dozens more tapes
just like this.

10:38.930 --> 10:40.891
From banking.
The picture business.

10:40.932 --> 10:42.142
-Newspapers.
-No, I don't need

10:42.184 --> 10:45.145
to hear 'em.
I believe you.

10:45.187 --> 10:47.647
This, uh, upheaval
on the West Coast,

10:47.689 --> 10:50.817
it presents an opportunity
to us, but it...

10:50.859 --> 10:52.861
gives people ideas.

10:52.903 --> 10:55.322
HOOVER:
You're right, Reichsmarschall.

10:55.364 --> 10:56.573
There's a feeling in the air.

10:56.615 --> 10:58.158
A kind of nostalgia.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.619
-For a past that never was.
-WHITCROFT: Hey,

11:00.660 --> 11:02.746
you got to understand that, uh,
some of these generals,

11:02.788 --> 11:03.997
they remember what it was like

11:04.039 --> 11:06.041
to fight
under the Stars and Stripes.

11:06.083 --> 11:07.584
They're soldiers.

11:07.626 --> 11:08.919
HOOVER:
A generation has grown up

11:08.960 --> 11:10.170
without the memory
of the Depression

11:10.212 --> 11:11.755
or the war.

11:11.797 --> 11:13.757
What the Reich
has provided them,

11:13.799 --> 11:16.051
they take for granted.

11:16.093 --> 11:18.053
This Americanism is a weed.

11:18.095 --> 11:21.348
-If we let it take root...
-What do you need, Edgar?

11:21.390 --> 11:23.308
Surveillance.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.185
Universal surveillance.

11:25.227 --> 11:27.145
-Don't you have that?
-HOOVER: We're only able

11:27.187 --> 11:29.648
to track suspected subversives,
informants.

11:29.689 --> 11:32.609
We need to be able to monitor
every Reich citizen

11:32.651 --> 11:34.277
24 hours a day.

11:34.319 --> 11:36.071
I admire your ambition.

11:36.113 --> 11:38.365
A new agency with the power

11:38.407 --> 11:41.785
to blanket the nation's
phone lines with wiretaps.

11:41.827 --> 11:43.662
Special cameras and microphones

11:43.703 --> 11:46.164
mounted in public
and private places.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.125
Nothing goes unseen.

11:48.166 --> 11:50.502
Even Berlin doesn't have that.

11:50.544 --> 11:52.087
We'll lead the way.

11:52.129 --> 11:53.964
It's gonna cost.

11:58.468 --> 12:00.429
Show me a plan.

12:00.470 --> 12:02.472
Heil Himmler.

12:13.483 --> 12:14.860
(door shuts)

12:14.901 --> 12:17.279
Damn fool.

12:17.320 --> 12:20.407
Wife and twins.

12:20.449 --> 12:23.076
Just glad we found him
before Berlin did.

12:23.118 --> 12:24.953
Yeah.

12:24.995 --> 12:26.455
Bill.

12:27.664 --> 12:30.876
If, uh, any more
like that turn up,

12:30.917 --> 12:34.671
I want to know about them
before Hoover, all right?

12:34.713 --> 12:36.381
Understood.

12:36.423 --> 12:39.217
Eyes only.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.972
("O Tannenbaum" playing)

12:44.014 --> 12:46.016
(quiet chatter)

13:04.284 --> 13:06.453
WOMAN:
Mrs. Smith's suit has arrived,

13:06.495 --> 13:08.038
but it needs
a bit of tailoring.

13:08.079 --> 13:10.373
-Martha, please.
-One moment, Amy.

13:10.415 --> 13:14.252
-When will it be ready?
-10:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.

13:14.294 --> 13:17.297
She'll be here to try it on,
so no later than that.

13:17.339 --> 13:18.673
Please, Martha?

13:18.715 --> 13:20.967
May I try it on?

13:21.009 --> 13:24.721
That dirndl would look
absolutely adorable on you.

13:24.763 --> 13:27.098
Maybe we should talk
to your mother about it.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.684
Perhaps the salesgirl
will hold onto it for us?

13:29.726 --> 13:30.685
Be happy to.

13:30.727 --> 13:33.313
Can I at least try it on first?

13:35.732 --> 13:38.443
Of course.

13:44.449 --> 13:46.826
See if they have it
in your size.

13:52.707 --> 13:54.626
Stay with the girl.

13:54.668 --> 13:56.670
I'll be right back.

14:13.603 --> 14:15.981
(faucet running)

14:21.653 --> 14:24.698
Are you a little girl?

14:24.739 --> 14:26.700
What?

14:26.741 --> 14:28.994
Are you... a little girl?

14:29.035 --> 14:31.037
I don't underst...
(grunts)

14:31.079 --> 14:34.124
-Because if you're not,
there's only one reason...
-(pained cry)

14:34.165 --> 14:36.209
...that I can think of

14:36.251 --> 14:37.961
for you to be in
the girls' department.

14:38.003 --> 14:40.380
Lady, you got me all wrong.

14:40.422 --> 14:42.173
You've been following us
around all morning.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.551
-I'm shopping for my niece.
-Can your niece vouch for you?

14:44.593 --> 14:45.594
Well, she's in the hospital,
so...

14:45.635 --> 14:48.638
Stop lying, pervert.

14:48.680 --> 14:51.182
I wasn't gonna hurt anybody.
God, please don't hurt me.

14:51.224 --> 14:54.352
If I ever catch you peeping
at little girls again...

14:56.146 --> 14:59.274
...I will take that eye.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.835
Well?

15:18.877 --> 15:20.879
Fix me a drink, will you?

15:22.714 --> 15:24.674
WYATT:
What happened with Helen Smith?

15:24.716 --> 15:26.760
She wasn't there,
but she's got a dress fitting.

15:26.801 --> 15:29.888
10:00 a.m. tomorrow.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.307
-Well done.
-Mm. She's got extra security.

15:32.349 --> 15:34.851
Some dame switchblade artist.

15:34.893 --> 15:36.603
I took her for a nanny.
It was sloppy of me.

15:36.645 --> 15:38.271
All right, can you
flag her for us?

15:38.313 --> 15:40.482
Mm-mm. I don't ever want
to set foot

15:40.523 --> 15:42.025
in that store again.

15:42.067 --> 15:43.401
Can you flag her?

15:43.443 --> 15:46.780
(exhales)
Yeah, I can flag her.

15:46.821 --> 15:48.490
All right, well,
I'll be waiting for you

15:48.531 --> 15:49.699
out here in the alleyway.

15:49.741 --> 15:51.201
I'll keep the car running.

15:51.242 --> 15:53.328
Bellows, Richie
and Irwin will regroup

15:53.370 --> 15:54.913
and meet back here.

15:56.915 --> 15:59.042
It's a plan, then.

15:59.084 --> 16:01.753
JULIANA:
10:00 a.m.

16:01.795 --> 16:04.047
Just one more detail left.

16:11.221 --> 16:14.099
Bite down hard on the capsule.

16:14.140 --> 16:17.811
That way, they can't
make you puke it up.

16:17.852 --> 16:20.772
It's quick. No pain.

16:22.357 --> 16:23.733
(sighs)

16:26.152 --> 16:28.947
Another round, bartender.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.741
For tomorrow, we may die.

MAN (in distance):
Get a gurney in here.

17:52.781 --> 17:54.616
Get Dr. Holtz in here
as soon as possible.

17:54.657 --> 17:56.659
Get over here.

17:56.701 --> 17:58.787
(gurney rolling)

17:58.828 --> 18:00.789
-(buzzer blares)
-Quick, quick.
We got to get him back.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.458
I need help with this.

18:03.500 --> 18:04.626
Let's go. Hurry up.

18:07.462 --> 18:09.047
Quick.
(continues indistinctly)

18:09.088 --> 18:11.508
(Abendsen whimpering)

18:11.549 --> 18:14.552
(quiet, indistinct chatter)

18:18.306 --> 18:21.518
(sobbing):
Caroline! Carol...!

18:21.559 --> 18:23.853
No!

18:23.895 --> 18:26.648
No! No!

18:35.657 --> 18:37.534
(speaking Japanese)

18:41.037 --> 18:42.330
Kanpai.

18:42.372 --> 18:44.165
OTHERS:
Kanpai.

18:49.546 --> 18:53.550
I look around
at all your young faces.

18:53.591 --> 18:56.511
Well, some not so young anymore.

18:56.553 --> 19:01.182
So many young men have come
through this department.

19:01.224 --> 19:04.811
Not all of them will be
going home to Japan today.

19:12.527 --> 19:15.321
(sighs)
I was a hard boss.

19:17.198 --> 19:18.867
I know.

19:18.908 --> 19:23.288
I demanded everything of my men.

19:23.329 --> 19:26.457
I rarely gave praise.

19:26.499 --> 19:30.295
There were young men
who died at my command

19:30.336 --> 19:32.755
trying to please me.

19:32.797 --> 19:35.550
And even as they died
in my arms,

19:35.592 --> 19:38.845
I offered no kind word.

19:40.805 --> 19:43.725
So, I will say it now.

19:46.102 --> 19:48.438
You make me proud.

19:50.607 --> 19:52.442
Each one of you.

19:54.444 --> 19:55.737
(speaking Japanese)

20:05.121 --> 20:07.040
Now...

20:10.627 --> 20:14.005
...go to the docks
and sail back home.

20:14.047 --> 20:16.841
Your families miss you terribly.

20:16.883 --> 20:19.928
Do not keep them waiting.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.187
(bell jingles, door closes)

20:34.192 --> 20:36.152
YUKIKO:
Who was at the door?

20:36.194 --> 20:38.321
What?

20:38.363 --> 20:42.075
Every time someone knocks,
I fear it is vigilantes.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.878
Crown Princess.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.047
That's a letter of transit.

20:56.089 --> 20:57.924
For me. To Japan.

20:57.966 --> 21:00.218
As a thank-you.

21:03.346 --> 21:05.098
Would you really leave?

21:05.139 --> 21:08.559
Everything you've built,
your business...

21:08.601 --> 21:10.603
It's all ruined anyway.

21:10.645 --> 21:12.647
Everything's falling apart here.

21:12.689 --> 21:15.024
You know, it-it's gonna be gone.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.112
We could go.

21:19.153 --> 21:21.489
Together.

21:24.242 --> 21:27.203
-Together?
-Yes.

21:28.955 --> 21:31.624
Now, listen.

21:31.666 --> 21:33.292
I'll be inferior there.

21:34.377 --> 21:36.796
I mean, even more than here.

21:36.838 --> 21:40.466
I'll be untouchable.

21:40.508 --> 21:43.469
Are you sure you want
to be seen with me?

21:43.511 --> 21:46.055
I'm a peasant, Childan.

21:46.097 --> 21:48.516
My people work the fields.

21:51.519 --> 21:54.022
No, Yukiko.

21:54.063 --> 21:56.190
You are a queen.

21:56.232 --> 21:59.152
(chuckling):
Childan.

21:59.193 --> 22:01.946
You make me laugh.

22:01.988 --> 22:03.448
Wait a minute.
Hold on.

22:03.489 --> 22:04.449
-What?
-Hold on.

22:04.490 --> 22:07.076
I'm not going anywhere.

22:07.118 --> 22:09.787
This will just take a second.

22:09.829 --> 22:11.664
Come on, where is it?

22:11.706 --> 22:14.751
Aha-ha-ha-ha.

22:22.008 --> 22:26.220
This is a 1908 two-karat,
square-cut,

22:26.262 --> 22:28.765
filigreed art nouveau ring.

22:30.767 --> 22:33.394
Put it back in the safe,
Childan.

22:33.436 --> 22:35.313
Someone will steal it.

22:36.981 --> 22:38.858
I'm asking you to marry me.

22:40.109 --> 22:41.319
Oh.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.571
This isn't our custom.

22:43.613 --> 22:46.032
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

22:48.493 --> 22:50.244
All right, I...
I got carried away.

22:50.286 --> 22:51.454
I know it's wrong...

23:01.964 --> 23:04.133
I would be honored
to be your bride,

23:04.175 --> 23:06.844
Robert Childan.

23:11.390 --> 23:14.102
(chuckling)

23:14.143 --> 23:15.686
Can I, uh...

23:15.728 --> 23:17.647
You may kiss me.

23:21.567 --> 23:23.319
(Yukiko sighs, sniffs)

23:23.361 --> 23:25.196
Here. Here, here.

23:25.238 --> 23:26.697
Here.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.377
When?

23:39.418 --> 23:40.670
Tonight.

23:40.711 --> 23:42.588
Think you can find a priest?

23:42.630 --> 23:44.924
(chuckles)

23:44.966 --> 23:48.344
OKAMI (over phone):
I knew I'd get your call
eventually, Kido Taisa.

23:48.386 --> 23:50.346
Tell me.

23:50.388 --> 23:53.266
I take no pleasure
in reporting this.

23:53.307 --> 23:57.270
Toru was seen in the opium dens
of the floating world.

23:57.311 --> 23:59.522
I know what you're saying.

23:59.564 --> 24:01.482
This cannot be my son.

24:01.524 --> 24:03.693
I do not deny it.

24:03.734 --> 24:08.239
Well, then I think I can be
of service to both of you.

24:08.281 --> 24:12.702
After all, we have a history,
you and I.

24:12.743 --> 24:16.080
What is your price?
You always have one.

24:16.122 --> 24:20.459
Meet me at the Bamboo Palace,
and we'll talk.

24:44.192 --> 24:46.194
(distant door closes)

24:50.448 --> 24:52.658
(footsteps approaching)

24:58.414 --> 25:00.416
(high-pitched ringing)

25:03.127 --> 25:05.421
(exhales softly)

25:05.463 --> 25:07.089
(groans)

25:09.759 --> 25:11.969
Well, he's coming around now.

25:12.011 --> 25:14.555
Let's get him up on his feet.

25:15.806 --> 25:18.517
(speaking Japanese)

25:26.609 --> 25:28.402
Who are you?

25:29.987 --> 25:31.989
Grab the rope.

25:41.082 --> 25:45.836
You know, you never gave anyone
their last words.

25:45.878 --> 25:48.005
Their last meal.

25:49.257 --> 25:52.009
-No.
-Well,

25:52.051 --> 25:54.011
this is how it ends for you.

25:55.805 --> 25:58.099
Haul him up.

26:04.981 --> 26:07.358
(gunfire)

26:09.568 --> 26:12.071
Everybody, down on the ground.
Hands behind your heads.

26:12.113 --> 26:13.739
You, with the pistol.

26:13.781 --> 26:16.367
Push it off real slow.
You're outgunned.

26:16.409 --> 26:18.411
(gun clatters)

26:18.452 --> 26:20.413
What's going on here?

26:20.454 --> 26:22.039
This a lynching?

26:22.081 --> 26:23.541
DARIUS:
We claim these premises
in the name

26:23.582 --> 26:25.126
of the Black Communist
Rebellion.

26:25.167 --> 26:27.545
Ain't gonna be
no lynchings on our watch.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.297
You might want to find out
who that is first.

26:29.338 --> 26:31.340
It might change your mind.

26:34.427 --> 26:36.429
DARIUS:
Who are you?

26:38.472 --> 26:41.767
I am Chief Inspector
Takeshi Kido.

26:41.809 --> 26:43.436
LEON:
Damn.

26:43.477 --> 26:46.272
He's so busted up
I didn't even recognize him.

26:50.651 --> 26:53.612
Not on our watch.

26:53.654 --> 26:56.073
Cut the son of a bitch loose.

26:56.115 --> 26:58.617
Let's find someplace to put him.

27:08.461 --> 27:09.962
(rings)

27:10.004 --> 27:12.089
(chanting in Japanese)

27:13.591 --> 27:15.092
(singing bowl rings)

27:15.134 --> 27:17.303
(chanting continues)

27:22.641 --> 27:25.353
(minister speaking Japanese)

27:30.232 --> 27:33.569
(both repeat Japanese phrase)

27:43.287 --> 27:45.164
(speaks Japanese)

27:46.207 --> 27:48.501
We are married.
(laughs)

27:48.542 --> 27:49.752
(sniffles)

28:02.556 --> 28:05.726
It's just down here.
Right this way.

28:05.768 --> 28:08.145
ELIJAH:
I got a question for you.

28:08.187 --> 28:10.856
Morning of October 2, 1952,

28:10.898 --> 28:13.275
a man named Lonnie Robinson
was arrested

28:13.317 --> 28:16.362
on some trumped-up
nonsense charges.

28:16.404 --> 28:17.780
KIDO:
Nonsense?

28:17.822 --> 28:20.449
Loitering.
Creating a disturbance.

28:20.491 --> 28:22.451
Disappeared into
this here building

28:22.493 --> 28:24.286
and ain't been heard from since.

28:24.328 --> 28:26.414
What did he look like?

28:26.455 --> 28:28.457
Looked like me.

28:31.001 --> 28:32.628
He was my father.

28:33.671 --> 28:36.257
I do not know.

28:36.298 --> 28:38.634
-There have been so many.
-Must be a record.

28:38.676 --> 28:42.012
-File or something.
-Destroyed them.

28:42.054 --> 28:45.474
Where would he be at, then? Huh?

28:48.310 --> 28:50.312
The truth?

28:52.731 --> 28:54.733
(grunts)

28:59.905 --> 29:02.032
(panting)

29:04.785 --> 29:06.454
-You...
-LEON: Here it is, Elijah.

29:06.495 --> 29:09.290
Solid-core door, locks itself.

29:09.331 --> 29:11.542
It's perfect.

29:14.795 --> 29:16.797
(panting)

29:24.805 --> 29:26.640
What's this room for?

29:37.651 --> 29:39.653
(lock clicks)

30:03.052 --> 30:04.220
(indistinct chatter, laughter)

30:04.261 --> 30:06.514
The dressing room is clear.

30:09.099 --> 30:11.101
Take the far door.

30:23.155 --> 30:26.158
Stay with her. I'll take him.

30:52.184 --> 30:54.728
-Julia Mills.
-Helen.

30:54.770 --> 30:57.398
Thomas is alive.

30:57.439 --> 30:58.816
What?

30:58.857 --> 31:01.110
And your husband knows
where he is.

31:01.151 --> 31:04.238
-HELEN: How dare you.
-Everything I'm telling you
is true.

31:05.823 --> 31:07.950
And we believe
he's visited your son.

31:07.992 --> 31:09.785
That is not possible.

31:09.827 --> 31:11.078
Helen, he's deceiving you.

31:16.667 --> 31:19.503
Hey, lady, what's the big idea?

31:26.343 --> 31:27.928
JULIANA:
And there may even be evidence.

31:29.179 --> 31:32.766
Films, inside your home.

31:32.808 --> 31:34.351
At his office.

31:36.812 --> 31:38.647
MARTHA:
Stop!

31:38.689 --> 31:41.275
(panting)

31:44.361 --> 31:45.487
(grunts)

31:47.072 --> 31:51.160
Talk to me. Talk to me.

31:51.201 --> 31:52.995
What unit do you belong to?

31:53.037 --> 31:54.955
Spit it out!

31:54.997 --> 31:57.833
-Where are the others?
-(choking)

31:57.875 --> 31:59.960
Talk to me, or you'll die blind.

32:01.420 --> 32:03.088
HELEN:
Why are you telling me this?

32:05.924 --> 32:08.135
If you want to know more...

32:15.976 --> 32:17.645
What makes you think
that I wouldn't

32:17.686 --> 32:19.313
turn you over to my husband?

32:22.399 --> 32:25.569
I think you're ready
for the truth.

32:25.611 --> 32:27.488
Resistance is in the building.

32:27.529 --> 32:28.947
Go.

32:29.948 --> 32:31.742
Let's get her to safety.

32:31.784 --> 32:33.369
Seal and sweep now.

32:33.410 --> 32:35.079
Did anybody approach you?

32:35.120 --> 32:38.082
What are you...
what are you talking... about?

32:38.123 --> 32:40.542
-Why are you manhandling me?
-There's a dead body
on the stairs.

32:40.584 --> 32:44.004
Get SS in here to check the
prints against their records.

32:58.185 --> 33:00.187
Where's Erwin?

33:02.272 --> 33:04.566
What? Was he taken?

33:04.608 --> 33:06.568
Erwin was a good soldier.

33:06.610 --> 33:08.737
-He knew what to do.
-RICHIE: They called in

33:08.779 --> 33:12.241
a morgue truck
on the police band.

33:12.282 --> 33:13.659
He's gone.

33:13.701 --> 33:14.910
JULIANA:
Fuck.

33:18.330 --> 33:20.541
(groans)

33:20.582 --> 33:22.501
Everything just got harder.
You know that.

33:22.543 --> 33:24.545
Yeah, I know that.

33:24.586 --> 33:27.464
Is this where you tell me
to cut my losses?

33:27.506 --> 33:30.300
There's nothing to cut,
'cause we haven't lost yet.

33:30.342 --> 33:32.177
She just made contact.

33:32.219 --> 33:33.887
Whatever that's worth.

33:33.929 --> 33:36.515
Helen could've screamed
for help in the store.

33:36.557 --> 33:37.933
She didn't.

33:37.975 --> 33:40.352
BELLOWS (sighs):
Hey.

33:41.603 --> 33:43.564
Was it worth it?

33:43.605 --> 33:46.024
'Cause that's all
I want to know.

33:46.066 --> 33:47.901
We may never fucking know.

33:47.943 --> 33:51.321
No, we'll know.

33:51.363 --> 33:53.490
When it's over.

33:57.202 --> 33:58.996
HELEN (sighs):
I'm sorry, John.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.497
I wish I could've been
more helpful.

34:00.539 --> 34:02.249
If I'd seen anything, I...

34:02.291 --> 34:04.042
No, you told them
everything you could.

34:04.084 --> 34:05.586
That's-that's good for now.

34:05.627 --> 34:08.005
The Staatspolizei
can return any time,

34:08.046 --> 34:10.424
if you remember anything.

34:10.466 --> 34:13.177
I should head downstairs
and finish up with them.

34:14.762 --> 34:16.472
(elevator bell chimes)

34:18.474 --> 34:21.143
Our family thanks you,
Agent Stroud.

34:21.185 --> 34:23.145
That's what we train for, sir.

34:23.187 --> 34:24.646
All in the service
of the Reich.

34:24.688 --> 34:26.857
Well, I'm just...
just glad you were there.

34:26.899 --> 34:27.900
That's all.

34:32.696 --> 34:34.072
HELEN:
The additional security,

34:34.114 --> 34:36.450
it was worth it.

34:36.492 --> 34:38.494
Thank you, John.

34:39.536 --> 34:41.246
You must be exhausted.

34:41.288 --> 34:44.416
I am. Yes.

34:47.127 --> 34:49.838
They're pretty thorough.

34:49.880 --> 34:53.550
Once they've identified
the body, we should know more.

34:55.594 --> 34:58.806
I think I'm gonna
go and lie down.

35:05.354 --> 35:07.397
(door closes)

35:19.785 --> 35:21.787
(train rumbling)

35:44.142 --> 35:47.062
SMITH:
Agent Campbell,
what have you got?

35:48.522 --> 35:50.899
Your son's training
is nearly complete.

35:50.941 --> 35:52.526
The 3rd Marine Division

35:52.568 --> 35:55.070
is expected to leave
for Da Nang soon.

35:55.112 --> 35:57.781
When I was in the Signal Corps,

35:57.823 --> 36:01.785
combat units were given three
days R & R before shipping out.

36:01.827 --> 36:03.412
He'll get the same, sir.

36:05.956 --> 36:08.500
SMITH:
I need to know the moment
he gets that leave.

36:08.542 --> 36:11.128
CAMPBELL:
Yes, sir. I will return
to the alt-world this evening

36:11.169 --> 36:13.922
and maintain close observation.

36:13.964 --> 36:16.174
-(approaching footsteps)
-MAN: Reichsmarschall.

36:18.135 --> 36:20.721
-What is it?
-Hawthorne Abendsen, sir.

36:23.974 --> 36:25.976
(quiet, steady beeping)

36:33.025 --> 36:35.193
How was this allowed to happen?

36:35.235 --> 36:37.738
He broke the glass plate
on his Moviola,

36:37.779 --> 36:39.656
-smuggled it back to his cell.
-And his wife?

36:39.698 --> 36:41.366
ABENDSEN:
She sharpened a spoon
into a blade.

36:41.408 --> 36:44.870
-He's been sedated.
-Used it to cut her throat.

36:49.458 --> 36:51.251
You're dismissed.

36:55.339 --> 36:57.716
(takes a deep breath)

37:00.886 --> 37:03.096
I'm sorry this happened,
Abendsen.

37:03.138 --> 37:05.432
You're the reason
it happened, John.

37:05.474 --> 37:08.143
She knew there was no other way
to escape a life sentence.

37:08.185 --> 37:10.187
It didn't have to be
a life sentence.

37:12.981 --> 37:15.317
If you just cooperated,
you could've had your freedom.

37:15.359 --> 37:18.987
ABENDSEN (scoffs): What the hell
do you know about freedom?

37:19.029 --> 37:21.657
Come on. What's it gonna take
to kill me, John?

37:21.698 --> 37:23.325
What do I have to do?

37:24.409 --> 37:26.870
Oh, I'm not gonna let you die.

37:28.121 --> 37:29.790
(exhales)

37:29.831 --> 37:32.960
Yeah. We'll see about that.

37:33.001 --> 37:34.962
You keep coming to me
for answers,

37:35.003 --> 37:38.131
well, here's the last answer
you're ever getting from me:

37:38.173 --> 37:40.175
you're cursed.

37:40.217 --> 37:43.470
John Smith, you're damned.

37:43.512 --> 37:47.641
You fucked with the Fates,
and they don't like that.

37:50.811 --> 37:53.981
You'll never know peace, John.

37:54.022 --> 37:56.149
You'll wander forever

37:56.191 --> 37:59.361
between the worlds... lost!

38:00.946 --> 38:02.656
Lost!

38:08.829 --> 38:10.747
(snaps heels)

38:27.848 --> 38:29.808
(breathing shakily)

38:34.479 --> 38:36.481
You don't understand.

38:36.523 --> 38:38.984
They're like my family.

38:39.026 --> 38:40.235
No, Bridget.

38:40.277 --> 38:41.987
They're not.

38:42.029 --> 38:44.656
You have your own family,
don't you?

38:51.997 --> 38:53.457
(elevator bell dings)

39:02.841 --> 39:06.303
Devious little fucker's
flown in from Berlin.

39:22.277 --> 39:23.945
Reichsmarschall.

39:27.199 --> 39:29.117
General.

39:30.452 --> 39:32.454
Well, this is unexpected.

39:33.663 --> 39:35.540
What brings you here?

39:35.582 --> 39:39.252
Fuhrer has called an
emergency conference in Berlin.

39:39.294 --> 39:41.171
To discuss the future
of the West Coast.

39:41.213 --> 39:43.048
Surely, the...

39:43.090 --> 39:45.884
Fuhrer didn't send an SS general
all the way here

39:45.926 --> 39:47.594
just to invite me to Berlin.

39:47.636 --> 39:50.305
You haven't been invited,
Reichsmarschall.

39:50.347 --> 39:51.807
You've been summoned.

39:54.893 --> 39:56.561
I see.

39:56.603 --> 39:59.356
And I'm here to make sure you...

39:59.397 --> 40:01.399
don't get lost along the way.

40:03.401 --> 40:05.320
Our plane departs at dawn.

40:05.362 --> 40:07.155
A car will be
sent round for you.

40:13.495 --> 40:16.581
Oh, tell me, Reichsmarschall,

40:16.623 --> 40:20.001
do you consider yourself
a lucky man?

40:21.253 --> 40:23.547
I don't believe in luck.

40:23.588 --> 40:25.715
Neither do I.

40:25.757 --> 40:27.592
Everything I have, I've...

40:27.634 --> 40:29.511
taken by strategy.

40:36.393 --> 40:38.019
You know what?

40:39.062 --> 40:41.940
We never did have that drink.

40:41.982 --> 40:43.942
I'm a man of my word.

40:43.984 --> 40:46.153
Straight up or on the rocks?

40:46.194 --> 40:47.988
Straight up.

40:58.707 --> 41:02.711
And, um...
what shall we drink to?

41:02.752 --> 41:05.046
To the Fuhrer, of course.

41:08.175 --> 41:10.594
("Anything Goes"

41:13.930 --> 41:15.849

41:15.891 --> 41:17.434

41:58.683 --> 42:01.436
BCR has claimed this place
in the name

42:01.478 --> 42:03.521
of the people of San Francisco.

42:03.563 --> 42:06.316
You'd do well to be
on the next ship out of here.

42:06.358 --> 42:08.568
We're not going anywhere.

42:08.610 --> 42:10.070
"We"?

42:12.030 --> 42:14.491
The services we provide...

42:14.532 --> 42:16.534
are always in demand.

42:16.576 --> 42:19.746
No matter who occupies
the throne.

42:19.788 --> 42:21.581
Gokudo.

42:21.623 --> 42:23.291
Yakuza.

42:23.333 --> 42:28.296
You have no place
in San Francisco anymore.

42:28.338 --> 42:30.715
You're going to need us.

42:30.757 --> 42:32.550
To restore electricity.

42:32.592 --> 42:34.344
Water.

42:34.386 --> 42:36.680
The oil pipeline.

42:41.142 --> 42:43.103
(exhales softly)

42:47.691 --> 42:51.486
It's one thing
to overthrow a government.

42:51.528 --> 42:53.989
It's another thing...

42:54.030 --> 42:55.949
to be the government.

42:55.991 --> 42:57.867
We've come this far.

42:57.909 --> 42:59.577
We don't need you.

43:28.106 --> 43:30.150
You know how to find us.

43:56.551 --> 43:58.553
(door opens, footsteps approach)

44:01.264 --> 44:03.141
(door closes)

44:03.183 --> 44:05.268
John.

44:05.310 --> 44:06.978
Bill.

44:07.020 --> 44:08.605
I need a word.

44:10.899 --> 44:13.526
Uh, in private.

44:20.742 --> 44:22.327
(drawer slides shut)

44:22.369 --> 44:24.371
Is that the only
listening device in this room?

44:24.412 --> 44:26.373
Has it been swept recently?

44:27.665 --> 44:29.417
What is it?

44:31.211 --> 44:32.879
It's Hoover.

44:32.921 --> 44:35.173
HENRY (on tape):
Jennifer said

44:35.215 --> 44:36.841
crazy things sometimes.

44:36.883 --> 44:39.803
ARBI AGENT:
Like what, Henry? Crazy how?

44:39.844 --> 44:42.138
HENRY:
Uh, she said
she used to stay up

44:42.180 --> 44:43.765
all night long
in the Neutral Zone

44:43.807 --> 44:47.268
listening to something
called Resistance Radio.

44:47.310 --> 44:50.480
Jennifer said the DJs
talked about Negroes and Jews.

44:50.522 --> 44:52.816
Crazy conspiracy stories,
really.

44:52.857 --> 44:54.567
ARBI AGENT:
What stories, Henry?

44:54.609 --> 44:57.320
HENRY:
Stories about...
what happened to them.

44:57.362 --> 44:58.988
ARBI AGENT:
What happened to them, Henry?

44:59.030 --> 45:00.740
All right, shut it off.

45:00.782 --> 45:02.784
-HENRY: She said they were...
-(tape player clicks)

45:06.246 --> 45:08.998
There's more, John.

45:10.583 --> 45:12.460
Your housekeeper...

45:12.502 --> 45:15.255
your wife's friends,
your old neighbors.

45:15.296 --> 45:18.633
If you had a dog,
he would be informing on you.

45:22.303 --> 45:24.889
I don't have to tell you
they mean to use all this

45:24.931 --> 45:26.766
against you in Berlin.

45:32.355 --> 45:34.357
There's, um...

45:36.359 --> 45:38.820
...another way.

45:40.530 --> 45:42.866
What's that?

45:48.580 --> 45:51.124
You know I'm loyal
to you above all.

45:51.166 --> 45:52.750
All right, it's been 25 years...

45:52.792 --> 45:54.752
Just say it, Bill.

45:56.754 --> 45:59.883
We have 103 nukes in silos
across the country.

45:59.924 --> 46:01.593
On our own...

46:01.634 --> 46:04.262
we are a superpower.

46:07.098 --> 46:09.309
We could go our own way, John.

46:11.352 --> 46:13.730
Our military
will fall in behind you.

46:13.771 --> 46:17.025
We tear up that flag, there's
nothing Berlin can do about it.

46:18.276 --> 46:20.361
Unless they wanted
World War III.

46:22.405 --> 46:24.699
You realize you could be shot
for saying that?

46:24.741 --> 46:27.368
I'm willing to take that chance.

46:27.410 --> 46:30.497
Look, I'll follow you
wherever you go.

46:39.297 --> 46:41.966
I have to go to Berlin, Bill.

46:44.385 --> 46:46.304
If anything should happen to me,

46:46.346 --> 46:48.806
then, uh...

46:48.848 --> 46:52.352
Helen and the girls need to be
taken to safety without delay.

46:52.393 --> 46:54.103
Of course.

46:54.145 --> 46:57.815
I've made detailed plans
for their well-being.

46:59.817 --> 47:02.529
They're in my safe.
This is the key.

47:08.243 --> 47:10.411
You don't have to do this, John.

47:10.453 --> 47:13.373
I think we both know
that's not true.

47:22.674 --> 47:24.092
(door opens)

47:26.928 --> 47:28.638
(door closes)
