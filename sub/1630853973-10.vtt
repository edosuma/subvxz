Disappointment is

00:39.221 --> 00:40.526

Captain Freeman.

00:40.570 --> 00:42.876
Project Swing By

We got to wrap this up.

09:51.381 --> 09:53.557
Sir, I'm sorry, but
we have to stop construction.

09:53.601 --> 09:55.298
-What are you talking about?
-The scans missed

09:55.341 --> 09:57.256
microscopic signs of life
in the soil.

09:57.300 --> 09:59.302
We need to make sure
it isn't sentient.

09:59.345 --> 10:00.477
RANSOM:
Everyone, stop!

10:00.520 --> 10:01.652
Captain, we have a potential

10:01.696 --> 10:03.088
microbial life down here.

10:03.132 --> 10:04.873
We need to do
a full self-awareness assessment

10:04.916 --> 10:06.396
before we finish the outpost.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.615
Wha-- [scoffs] Of course.

10:07.658 --> 10:09.529
But hurry.
We've just lost our lead.

10:12.271 --> 10:14.099
-[computer trills]
-We're good.

10:14.143 --> 10:15.666
Okay, go, go, go!

10:15.710 --> 10:17.015
-Move, people! Let's go!
-[sighs] I'm sorry.

10:17.059 --> 10:18.495
I-I could've sworn
there was life...

10:18.538 --> 10:20.149
No, no, no, this stuff
has a multiphasic charge,

10:20.192 --> 10:22.891
confuses the [bleep]
out of a tricorder. Let's go.

10:22.934 --> 10:25.676
[sighs]
Outpost is complete, Captain.

10:25.720 --> 10:27.199
I need warp now!

10:29.158 --> 10:31.421
We just have to deliver
supplies to Ockmenic 9.

10:31.464 --> 10:34.380
It's one of those Brigadoon-type
planets that only phases

10:34.424 --> 10:36.426
into our dimension
for a couple hours a year.

10:36.469 --> 10:40.212
Hopefully, we can catch up
to the Aledobefore it appears.

10:47.263 --> 10:49.918
Ugh, this blows!
It's taking forever.

10:49.961 --> 10:51.876
Just don't embarrass me, okay?

10:51.920 --> 10:53.704
You're the one who begged
to come with me, all right?

10:53.748 --> 10:55.532
Well, I wanted to see the ship.

10:55.575 --> 10:57.403
They're gonna be in orbit.

10:57.447 --> 10:59.144
It's gonna be like
a tiny little dot.

10:59.188 --> 11:01.103
You're not going to
see them at all.

11:05.324 --> 11:08.545
Whoa, ho, ho, ho, ho. Hey!

11:08.588 --> 11:10.547
-Down here!
-They can't hear you.

11:10.590 --> 11:12.157
Thanks for all the stuff!

11:12.201 --> 11:13.550
All right, shut up
for a second. [clears throat]

11:13.593 --> 11:15.900
Supplies received.
The Ockmenians appreciate

11:15.944 --> 11:18.294
-all Starfleet...
-Next time, send a replicator!

11:18.337 --> 11:20.513
Oh, my God,
why are you like this?

11:20.557 --> 11:23.429
BARNES: Captain, the planet
is already phasing away.

11:23.473 --> 11:26.737
No. No!

11:26.781 --> 11:29.087
[sighs] We're too late.

11:29.131 --> 11:31.220
[Buenamigo laughing]

11:45.060 --> 11:48.106
[sighs] God, we would've won
if I hadn't defended the life

11:48.150 --> 11:49.586
of some inert dust.

11:49.629 --> 11:51.414
[sighs]
When secondary scans find life,

11:51.457 --> 11:53.155
you have to drop everything.

11:53.198 --> 11:55.200
That's, like, the entire point
of the prime directive.

11:55.244 --> 11:56.636
Right, Rutherford?
Back me up here.

11:56.680 --> 11:58.638
Yeah, yeah, sure.
You did the right thing.

11:58.682 --> 12:00.379
Thanks, but if it was
the right thing,

12:00.423 --> 12:02.207
why didn't the Aledo
slow down, too?

12:02.251 --> 12:03.208
Huh?

12:03.252 --> 12:05.602
[laughs] You're right!

12:07.169 --> 12:10.085
That was weird,
but I'll take it.

12:10.128 --> 12:12.174
-[PADD rings, trills]
-BUENAMIGO: Carol,

12:12.217 --> 12:14.654
I trust you're ready
to admit defeat?

12:14.698 --> 12:16.700
I was about to say
the same to you.

12:16.744 --> 12:18.876
[scoffs, laughs]
TheAledo trounced you.

12:18.920 --> 12:21.966
Sure, because it skipped
analyzing signs of life

12:22.010 --> 12:24.055
on LT-358.

12:24.099 --> 12:25.622
Come on, that's a barren rock.

12:25.665 --> 12:27.798
But there was a chance
it wasn't.

12:27.842 --> 12:29.321
I don't always love
the constraints

12:29.365 --> 12:30.888
of the prime directive,

12:30.932 --> 12:33.325
but your little toy
totally ignored it.

12:33.369 --> 12:35.458
[scoffs] Oh, stop.
This is a rounding error.

12:35.501 --> 12:38.635
One that proves the Texas-class
isn't fit for duty.

12:38.678 --> 12:41.769
I'm sorry, Les, but I have to
take this to the council.

12:44.815 --> 12:47.818
[gasps] Nuh-uh. Nuh-uh!

12:47.862 --> 12:49.602
W-W-Wait, wait.
What are you nuh-uh'ing?

12:49.646 --> 12:51.735
I figured it out!
This code is mine.

12:51.779 --> 12:53.781
The Aledoruns on my AI.

12:53.824 --> 12:55.870
There's minor changes,
but it's all there.

12:55.913 --> 12:57.393
But how does that
make any sense?

12:57.436 --> 12:59.047
It was Admiral Buenamigo's
secret project.

12:59.090 --> 13:01.266
Yeah, but I coded this
back when I was the old me,

13:01.310 --> 13:03.747
the angry ship racing me.
[screams]

13:05.140 --> 13:06.271
Keep it together.

13:06.315 --> 13:08.447
[screams]

13:08.491 --> 13:10.188
How much do you want to erase?

13:10.232 --> 13:13.452
Everything that has to do
with me or the program.

13:15.715 --> 13:17.369
Admiral Buenamigo.

13:17.413 --> 13:19.197
He's the one that had me
working on the prototype

13:19.241 --> 13:20.633
for the Texas-class ships.

13:20.677 --> 13:23.114
[gasps] He's the one
who erased your memories!

13:23.158 --> 13:25.943
Yeah, he used my designs,
my code... [gasps]

13:25.987 --> 13:27.858
That's the same code
I used for Badgey.

13:27.902 --> 13:30.469
Oh, no. A starship
can't have daddy issues.

13:30.513 --> 13:32.558
-We got to warn the Captain.
-BUENAMIGO: No.

13:32.602 --> 13:35.257
This would set the Texas-class
project back decades.

13:35.300 --> 13:36.736
If that's what it takes

13:36.780 --> 13:37.825
-to ensure that...
-[door chimes, opens]

13:37.868 --> 13:39.130
Captain, you need to see this!

13:39.174 --> 13:41.089
-Ensign, I'm busy.
-Rutherford?

13:41.132 --> 13:43.178
Yeah, that's right,
and I figured it out.

13:43.221 --> 13:44.657
The Aledo'scode is corrupted.

13:44.701 --> 13:46.355
He erased my memory
to cover it up.

13:46.398 --> 13:48.270
The AI is the same one
that killed Shaxs.

13:48.313 --> 13:49.880
Why did I stop at your memory?

13:49.924 --> 13:51.360
I should've erased all of you!

13:51.403 --> 13:53.144
Les, what the hell is this?

13:53.188 --> 13:54.885
Starfleet is so competitive.

13:54.929 --> 13:56.887
Once you're an admiral,
you hit a wall.

13:56.931 --> 13:59.368
I've been trying for years
to make a name for myself.

13:59.411 --> 14:01.152
I'm not letting you
take it from me,

14:01.196 --> 14:02.806
not after everything I did

14:02.850 --> 14:05.069
-to get us here.
-Everything you did?

14:05.113 --> 14:06.114
Wait. That means...

14:06.157 --> 14:08.116
Yes, yes, I set you up.

14:08.159 --> 14:11.423
I was sure you would fail at
negotiations on Deep Space 9,

14:11.467 --> 14:13.599
but you stumbled
through that fiasco.

14:13.643 --> 14:15.123
And the Breen?

14:15.166 --> 14:16.733
Of course I knew
they were on Brekka.

14:16.776 --> 14:18.909
I needed theAledo
to save the day,

14:18.953 --> 14:21.651
and you handed me
a perfect disaster.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.653
My crew could've been killed!

14:23.696 --> 14:26.830
The Texas-class will keep
countless others out of danger.

14:26.874 --> 14:28.571
The good of the many, Carol.

14:28.614 --> 14:30.921
Sir, you don't understand.
The code you're using--

14:30.965 --> 14:33.097
its emotional processing
isn't stable.

14:33.141 --> 14:34.620
You can't bring
those ships online.

14:34.664 --> 14:36.884
You are not one of those
bad faith admirals

14:36.927 --> 14:38.146
that's up to no good.

14:38.189 --> 14:39.843
You're better than this, Les.

14:39.887 --> 14:41.932
I'm really not.
You know... [sighs]

14:41.976 --> 14:44.239
I'll-I'll say you attacked
the Aledoout of anger

14:44.282 --> 14:45.675
when you lost the race.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.198
It defended itself.

14:47.242 --> 14:48.460
-What?!
-Aledo,

14:48.504 --> 14:49.940
activate independent control,

14:49.984 --> 14:52.856
command authorization

14:52.900 --> 14:55.119
[whirring, beeping]

14:55.163 --> 14:58.079
ALEDO COMPUTER:
I am now fully autonomous.

14:58.122 --> 14:59.645
The Cerritos
is under enemy command.

14:59.689 --> 15:02.518
Block all communications
and destroy it.

15:04.694 --> 15:06.478
Aledo,do you understand?

15:06.522 --> 15:08.437
I said attack the Cerritos!

15:08.480 --> 15:11.744
ALEDO COMPUTER: I don't take
orders from you anymore, Father.

15:11.788 --> 15:13.964
What?
Aledo,deactivate independence.

15:14.008 --> 15:16.749
ALEDO COMPUTER: I will burn
your heart in a fire.

15:16.793 --> 15:20.362
Aledo,stand down.
Stand down, I comm...

15:23.321 --> 15:24.844
The Aledo'sattacking

15:34.942 --> 15:36.682
andCorpus Christi.

15:36.726 --> 15:37.988
Shields up! Red Alert!

15:38.032 --> 15:39.555
The Aledohas activated two more

15:39.598 --> 15:42.036
-Texas-class ships, Captain.
-[alarm blaring]

15:42.079 --> 15:44.168
FREEMAN:
There's too many of them.

15:44.212 --> 15:46.170
Put out a distress call,
all channels.

15:50.740 --> 15:52.002
[screaming]

15:54.483 --> 15:56.615
[screaming]

15:58.182 --> 16:00.445
PETRA:
Okay. Qualor III.

16:00.489 --> 16:02.447
These guys love a party.

16:02.491 --> 16:04.536
They're gonna want to celebrate
when we hand this over.

16:04.580 --> 16:07.496
[yawns] I'm still wiped
from all that Ferengi mocking.

16:07.539 --> 16:09.715
I'm gonna sit this one out.
Ooh, bring me back a slushy.

16:09.759 --> 16:11.979
Hey, I'll bring you back two.

16:14.590 --> 16:16.244
Okay.

16:16.287 --> 16:18.855
Time to find out who's funding
this little operation.

16:18.898 --> 16:20.944
-Forgot my punch card.
-[shouts]

16:20.988 --> 16:24.469
You got a second wind to dig
into my private files, huh?

16:24.513 --> 16:26.384
Yeah, see,
I'm not into the whole

16:26.428 --> 16:28.038
"mysterious benefactors" thing.

16:28.082 --> 16:29.692
This whole operation
is shady as hell.

16:29.735 --> 16:31.955
Fine. Go on, then, dig away.

16:34.436 --> 16:36.873
Admiral Picard? No way.

16:36.916 --> 16:40.181
Yes way. The guild has
a huge endowment from Jean-Luc.

16:40.224 --> 16:42.313
That guy loves mummies
even more than you.

16:42.357 --> 16:45.882
Aw, I was hoping for a Romulan
or at least a Xindi cabal.

16:45.925 --> 16:48.276
Hold on. You wanted to find
something nefarious?

16:48.319 --> 16:49.973
I think, deep down,

16:50.017 --> 16:52.149
I was looking for a reason
to go back to Starfleet.

16:52.193 --> 16:54.369
Are you joking?
You just escaped all that.

16:54.412 --> 16:56.806
I know, but I-I think I want
to be a part of something

16:56.849 --> 16:58.547
that stands
for the greater good.

16:58.590 --> 17:01.028
Oh, and archaeology doesn't?
That's a bit [bleep] rude.

17:01.071 --> 17:02.594
No. I mean, it's fun,

17:02.638 --> 17:04.770
but how many old brown pots
do we really need?

17:04.814 --> 17:06.511
All right, well,
that's just even ruder.

17:06.555 --> 17:07.904
I'd rather be digging up pots

17:07.947 --> 17:09.558
than serving on
your old ship today.

17:09.601 --> 17:11.473
-What does that mean?
-It's on all the news feeds.

17:11.516 --> 17:14.258
As usual, Starfleet's
getting people blown up,

17:14.302 --> 17:16.260
left, right and center.

17:16.304 --> 17:17.566
Oh, my God.

17:17.609 --> 17:19.524
-We have to help.
-No, we don't.

17:19.568 --> 17:21.657
-It's a bloodbath.
-Those are my friends.

17:26.444 --> 17:29.882
I said stop. It's not our fight.

17:29.926 --> 17:31.971
I know,
Starfleet's just an idea,

17:32.015 --> 17:33.930
but the people matter.

17:33.973 --> 17:35.497
You served on the Victory.
You know that.

17:35.540 --> 17:38.369
Mariner, it's suicide.
We're just one ship.

17:38.413 --> 17:40.110
I know,
but we have to do something.

17:40.154 --> 17:41.807
Ugh.

17:41.851 --> 17:44.375
Fine. You're gonna get me
killed, aren't you?

17:44.419 --> 17:46.029
Only one way to find out.

17:52.992 --> 17:54.646
Captain, what are your orders?

17:54.690 --> 17:56.822
Prepare sickbay for casualties
and hail the station.

17:56.866 --> 17:58.215
Get me communication with the...

17:58.259 --> 18:00.174
We got the Van Citters
warping in!

18:20.411 --> 18:22.065
They're tearing her up!

18:22.109 --> 18:24.285
We need to buy Starfleet
some time. Open a channel.

18:24.328 --> 18:28.158
Aledo, I have the man
who wrote your code.

18:28.202 --> 18:30.334
He's got the ability
to delete you

18:30.378 --> 18:32.467
unless you stand down.

18:32.510 --> 18:34.164
I do? Oh, yeah.

18:34.208 --> 18:36.993
You better stop attacking,
or you're dunsel.

18:37.036 --> 18:40.083
ALEDO COMPUTER: I will burn
your heart in a fire.

18:47.351 --> 18:49.962
They're-they're coming
pretty fast, Captain.

18:50.006 --> 18:52.356
Good, then they're not killing
any more civilians.

18:52.400 --> 18:53.662
Maximum warp me.

19:02.540 --> 19:04.151
They're still
in pursuit, Captain.

19:04.194 --> 19:06.196
We're holding at warp eight,
but they're gaining.

19:12.550 --> 19:14.770
Billups, I need full throttle.

19:14.813 --> 19:16.206
I'll give you everything I can,

19:16.250 --> 19:17.599
but I don't know how much
the struts can take.

19:17.642 --> 19:19.253
Let's find out.

19:19.296 --> 19:21.211
Brace yourselves.
This is about to get rough.

19:35.356 --> 19:37.314
That bought us some time,
but they're closing the gap.

19:37.358 --> 19:39.708
We're gonna have to make
our own luck. Give me options.

19:39.751 --> 19:41.231
I say we eject the warp core.

19:41.275 --> 19:42.885
We could drop out of warp
and surprise attack.

19:42.928 --> 19:44.103
AI doesn't get surprised.

19:44.147 --> 19:45.540
Can we rendezvous
with the Titan?
