Now nobody's saying the Chatsworth Estate
is the Garden of Eden,

00:06.240 --> 00:08.520
but it's been a good home to us, to me,

00:08.559 --> 00:13.360
Frank Gallagher, and me kids who
l'm proud of, cos every single one of 'em

00:13.399 --> 00:16.360
reminds me a little of me.

00:16.399 --> 00:22.080
They can all think for themselves,
which they've got me to thank for.

00:22.119 --> 00:25.760
Lip, who's a bit of a gobshite, which is why
nobody calls him Phillip any more.

00:25.800 --> 00:30.120
lan, a lot like his mam, which is handy for
the others cos she's disappeared into thin air.

00:30.159 --> 00:34.400
And Carl. We daren't let him
grow his hair for two reasons -

00:34.440 --> 00:37.960
it makes it stand on end and makes him
Iook like Toyah, and nits love him.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.080
Debbie - sent by God, total angel.

00:41.119 --> 00:44.120
You've to check your change

00:45.879 --> 00:48.600
plus lickle Liam,
who's gonna be a star some day.

00:48.639 --> 00:54.280
Sheila, me bird, couldn't be happier.
One plate short of a full set, like.

00:54.319 --> 00:57.480
And fantastic neighbours Kev
and Veronica - lend ya anything,

00:57.520 --> 00:58.880
well, almost anything.

00:58.919 --> 01:03.560
Carol and Marty - the lodgers from hell.
Last of the lonely hearts

01:03.599 --> 01:06.680
and a psychologist's wet dream.
Still, nobody's pe_ect.

01:06.720 --> 01:11.080
But all of 'em to a man
know first and foremost

01:11.119 --> 01:16.680
one of the most vital necessities in life
is they know how to throw a party!

01:16.720 --> 01:17.960
Heh, heh, heh, scatter!

01:24.040 --> 01:27.280
(Sheila) 'l was always a terrible
sleeper before l met Frank.

01:27.319 --> 01:30.600
'l used to have a recurring nightmare
where l was trapped in a roll of

01:30.639 --> 01:34.520
'carpet when l was due to turn on
the Christmas lights in Copenhagen,

01:34.559 --> 01:36.280
'home of the Little Mermaid.

01:38.399 --> 01:41.240
'lt's such a lovely story,
the Little Mermaid.

01:41.280 --> 01:44.240
'She loved the prince so much

01:44.280 --> 01:47.240
'she agreed to lose her voice
so she could marry him.

01:47.280 --> 01:49.720
'Since Frank and l have been an item

01:49.760 --> 01:53.360
'l haven't had the nightmare once.

01:53.399 --> 01:57.000
'l like to think it stopped
because once l'd met Frank,

01:57.040 --> 01:59.960
'all my dreams have come true.
Well, almost all.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.680
'The only thing l've got left to
dream about is the day l say ''l do''#

02:07.040 --> 02:10.080

Don't be long, babe.

03:24.119 --> 03:26.320
What the fuck you doing there?

03:26.359 --> 03:28.040
Out of supplies.

03:29.720 --> 03:32.200
- Bingo.
- Those are mine, actually!

03:32.240 --> 03:35.800
Fuck om. Expiry date June '06?

03:35.839 --> 03:38.160
l don't think so.

03:44.240 --> 03:47.960
lt's a two-slice limit on toast per person.
GROANING AND GRUNTING

03:48.000 --> 03:52.680
OtheM/ise the bread budget's
just a big joke. Hello?

03:53.399 --> 03:55.360
Yeah, more toast, ta.

03:55.679 --> 03:58.640
- What you doing sleeping outside?
- Ask Carl.

03:58.679 --> 04:01.000
- Have you had a fight?
(lan) Only with himself.

04:01.040 --> 04:02.440
- Oi!
- Good night, Carl?

04:02.480 --> 04:04.480
Surprised you got a wink of sleep.

04:07.359 --> 04:08.400
< Burn!

04:08.440 --> 04:10.520
Shit! Fire!

04:10.559 --> 04:12.440
Bloody hell, fire!

04:14.599 --> 04:16.560
Oi!

04:16.599 --> 04:18.240
What was that in aid of?

04:18.279 --> 04:20.560
l'm sorry, Carol. l just reacted.

04:20.599 --> 04:23.640
l thought it were Marty.
What the fuck are you burning?

04:23.679 --> 04:29.120
Memories. Suit of my dead husband.
Betrayed from beyond the grave.

04:29.159 --> 04:32.800
Man-made fibre. Drip dry.

04:36.240 --> 04:39.480
Shall l make comee or will
l be disturbing the crime scene?

04:39.520 --> 04:41.560
l know what it's like in CSl.

04:41.599 --> 04:46.440
lt's OK, Sheila. Have you had chance to
sort out what's missing?

04:46.480 --> 04:49.800
That's the funny thing. l don't
know if they were disturbed or...

04:49.839 --> 04:53.480
Oh! Oh, my God!
They've taken my Countdown mug!

04:53.520 --> 04:54.640
Frank!

04:54.679 --> 04:57.640
Bloody...Oh, bloody hell!

05:00.720 --> 05:03.160
Well, he definitely
came in the bedroom.

05:03.200 --> 05:04.840
Looks like he tried to
disguise himself an' all.

05:04.879 --> 05:08.160
Oh, no... That's mine.

05:15.240 --> 05:16.760
Fuckin' idiot!

05:16.800 --> 05:21.360
lf you'd left that out, l'd probably have thought it
was a truncheon.

05:21.399 --> 05:22.600
That's funny,

05:22.639 --> 05:24.360
you've just broken my dream.

05:24.399 --> 05:26.120
Oh, Tony, love.

05:26.159 --> 05:29.440
lt's an easy mistake to make.

05:29.480 --> 05:32.800
For me, you mean. It's no wonder girls, women,
don't fancy us.

05:32.839 --> 05:36.520
lt's like they smell it on me,
Sheila. It's no joke at my age.

05:36.559 --> 05:38.960
Oh...

05:45.919 --> 05:47.400
Thieves!

05:48.440 --> 05:49.920
Hi.

05:52.119 --> 05:54.320
All right, Carol, love?

05:54.359 --> 05:56.720
Looks like your Marty's getting on OK.

05:56.760 --> 05:58.480
Suits uniform, don't he?

06:02.599 --> 06:04.240
Carol, what's wrong?

06:04.280 --> 06:08.040
You of all people... Stay away from me!

06:08.079 --> 06:11.080
(Over radio) 'Shoplifter.
Aisle two. Beige coat. Female#

06:11.119 --> 06:14.240
Roger. Received.
Proceeding to aisle two.

06:14.280 --> 06:17.000
Carol, what's wrong? What is it?

06:17.040 --> 06:18.800
Her.

06:18.839 --> 06:21.000
- Carol?
(Marty) Are you sure? Fuck.

06:21.040 --> 06:23.120
- She doesn't look someone who'd...
- Stop her!

06:23.159 --> 06:24.320
(Lillian) Carol?

06:27.000 --> 06:28.160
Carol?

06:29.119 --> 06:32.280
What are you doing, Marty?
Let go of me!

06:32.319 --> 06:33.720
(Security guard) Keep hold of her!

06:33.760 --> 06:37.280
For the love of God,
l haven't done anything!

06:37.319 --> 06:39.360
Mum! Shoplifter!

06:41.760 --> 06:43.520
You!!

06:57.720 --> 06:59.720
Well, they're not pressing charges.

06:59.760 --> 07:02.880
Five pots of Chicken Tonight
and a lemon zester.

07:02.919 --> 07:04.960
What were you playing at, Mum?

07:05.000 --> 07:08.280
lt's too much to expect a bit of moral support
from me own flesh and blood.

07:08.319 --> 07:10.360
lt was Marty's first day!

07:10.399 --> 07:13.840
When did he ever keep a job
for more than five minutes?

07:13.879 --> 07:16.600
Anyway, if you're looking for
somebody to blame, blame her.

07:16.639 --> 07:18.800
Penny to a pound it was her
that tipped om the manager.

07:18.839 --> 07:21.360
Lillian? She's your best mate.

07:21.399 --> 07:23.000
Why would she do a thing like that?

07:28.720 --> 07:31.840
l found it in the pocket
of that suit of your dad's.

07:36.399 --> 07:38.200
Christ!

07:38.240 --> 07:41.640
You always said you thought he
were dipping his wick Jubilee year.

07:41.679 --> 07:43.880
Yeah, but with what's her name.

07:43.919 --> 07:45.600
Terrible teeth.

07:45.639 --> 07:47.360
You were too young to remember.

07:50.359 --> 07:55.120
We were as thick as thieves, Veronica -
Lillian and Brendan and me and your dad.

07:55.159 --> 07:56.360
Oh, Mum.

07:56.399 --> 07:59.960
Oh, don't worry about me.
l'm not one to sit idly by.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.080
'As ye sow, so shall ye reap#

08:02.119 --> 08:04.320
You mark my words.

08:04.359 --> 08:09.320
Yes, hello. l'd like to report
someone for benefit fraud.

08:09.359 --> 08:13.120
Chatsworth Estate, Meadowbank Road.

08:13.159 --> 08:18.800
Yes, that's right. Number...28.

08:25.079 --> 08:27.840
Fuckin' scum.

08:27.879 --> 08:31.080
Benefit fraud?
Who'd they think they're having on?

08:31.119 --> 08:32.760
That's Big Brother, innit?

08:32.799 --> 08:35.559
OM/ell, 1984.

08:35.599 --> 08:39.280
Sex crime! Sex crime! Course,
poor bugger'd know all about that.

08:39.318 --> 08:43.559
George OM/ell, real name Eric Blair.

08:43.599 --> 08:46.560
Lifelong socialist,
so, no relation to Tony.

08:46.599 --> 08:48.360
f3.95, Frank.

08:48.399 --> 08:51.320
lt's the thin end of the wedge.
Kev, what is it?

08:51.359 --> 08:53.720
lt's roots to whaddyamacallit.

08:53.760 --> 08:57.920
lf you drive a wedge into the
community you can do what you like.

08:57.960 --> 09:00.520
lt's how Hitler started.

09:00.559 --> 09:02.280
(Frank) They're after Lillian now.

09:02.319 --> 09:05.480
Fucking twat.
Some cunt called in, didn't they?

09:05.520 --> 09:10.000
Looked at that poster and thought,
''l know, l'll fuck her up.'' Why?

09:10.760 --> 09:12.080
(COUGHS)

09:12.119 --> 09:13.560
All right, Mum?

09:13.599 --> 09:15.360
Peanuts.

09:15.399 --> 09:18.320
Keep repeating on me.
Should've known better.

09:18.359 --> 09:20.000
They're not even paying!

09:20.040 --> 09:21.840
ls that what it's come to?

09:21.879 --> 09:25.760
Cos if it is,
fuckin' Bin Laden's won, hasn't he?

09:25.800 --> 09:29.520
Agincourt, Dunkirk, Live Aid...
Bomb the lot, may as well start again.

09:29.559 --> 09:33.360
l hear there's a push on.
It's not just them posters, Frank,

09:33.399 --> 09:35.200
they're not relying
on anybody calling in.

09:35.240 --> 09:36.800
As if anybody would.

09:36.839 --> 09:38.360
They are.

09:38.399 --> 09:41.360
No, apparently they're looking into
everyone round here who's claiming.

09:41.399 --> 09:42.440
Well, l'm fucked then!

09:42.480 --> 09:44.840
You and half the fuckin' estate.

09:44.879 --> 09:45.960
We're om!

09:49.359 --> 09:52.280
Where did you hear that then, Mum?

09:52.319 --> 09:54.160
Down the community centre.

09:59.319 --> 10:01.440
As soon as you can, yeah.

10:05.399 --> 10:07.760
Are you not a bit worried, Frank?

10:07.800 --> 10:11.960
Plight of the common man, mate. It's never
over till the fat lady fucks you over.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.760
Anyway, fuckers can't get me,
can they? l'm dead.

10:15.800 --> 10:18.760
Yeah, but haven't you and Lillian
been claiming for her Brendan?

10:25.399 --> 10:29.160
Waste of money that was.
Went down like a fuckin' lead balloon.

10:37.599 --> 10:39.280
Woo-hoo!

10:39.319 --> 10:41.440
Right, guys.

10:41.480 --> 10:43.480
Half the estate are scamming it.
They're ours for the taking.

10:43.520 --> 10:44.520
Fucking parasites!

10:44.559 --> 10:47.080
< You fit then? Let's go!

10:48.599 --> 10:50.160
Let's knock on every door.

11:10.760 --> 11:13.720
Carl! It's Mrs Pierce for yer! >

11:13.760 --> 11:16.680
What's she want?

11:16.720 --> 11:18.720
Can you ask her what she wants?

11:18.760 --> 11:20.920
What did your last slave die of?

11:29.919 --> 11:32.440
What've they been
feeding yer, Baby Bio?

11:32.479 --> 11:34.280
We've had a call from the Social.

11:34.319 --> 11:35.360
Another one?

11:35.399 --> 11:37.560
Thought we'd sorted it
Iast time. Can you come?

11:37.600 --> 11:39.200
Yeah, whatever.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.240
Still a tenner?

11:54.919 --> 11:56.600
Now then.

11:56.640 --> 11:58.720
Can you confirm that there is a child

11:58.760 --> 12:04.160
under 18, permanently resident at
your address, 26 Meadowbank Road?

12:04.200 --> 12:05.240
Yes, we can.

12:05.280 --> 12:08.840
And that you are the parent or
approved guardian of that child?

12:08.879 --> 12:10.560
Last time we looked. Eh, Dad?

12:12.479 --> 12:14.160
That's a yes, then...

12:14.200 --> 12:18.960
And you are currently claiming child
benefit for Nathan Andrew Pierce.

12:18.999 --> 12:20.680
That's correct.

12:20.720 --> 12:22.280
He's a big lad for ten, isn't he?

12:22.319 --> 12:24.280
Don't know where he came from.

12:24.319 --> 12:26.440
New pair of trainers
every five minutes.

12:31.839 --> 12:33.520
Yep, that's secure.

12:33.560 --> 12:36.800
You've done a good job.
They won't be bothering you again.

12:36.839 --> 12:40.520
Taught myself to be handy with a
power tool. Never looked back.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.600
Never really got into DIY myself.

12:55.519 --> 12:58.000
l'm too quick, right?

12:58.039 --> 13:00.720
l'm in there and
l'm trying to stop meself...

13:00.760 --> 13:03.880
think of all the teams
ever managed by Graeme Souness,

13:03.919 --> 13:07.200
or think of fucking Graeme Souness,
but it's like a road accident,

13:07.240 --> 13:09.720
and l'm flooring the brakes but
nothing stops me

13:09.760 --> 13:12.640
and yeah. Through the windscreen.
Gone in 60 seconds.

13:12.680 --> 13:15.400
Five, if l'm lucky.

13:15.439 --> 13:17.840
No-one's exactly
coming back for more.

13:17.879 --> 13:19.480
Oh, Tony love.

13:21.160 --> 13:23.320
Squeeze technique,
works like a charm!

13:23.359 --> 13:25.800
Eddie, Karen's dad, he was a
ten-second wonder

13:25.839 --> 13:27.440
when we first got together.

13:29.439 --> 13:31.840
And you're practically
family, aren't yer?

13:36.879 --> 13:39.000
Better now,

13:39.039 --> 13:41.880
that's better, that's right..

13:41.919 --> 13:44.160
Ahh.. arrgh... Fucking hell, Sheila!

13:44.200 --> 13:48.000
Oh, sorry, sorry,
don't know me own strength.

13:48.039 --> 13:49.720
OK?

13:49.760 --> 13:52.240
Yeah.. OK...

13:58.240 --> 14:01.080
l got Eddie up to a good five
minutes before he had to move

14:01.120 --> 14:04.560
into the spare room. That was a
wedding that should never have been.

14:04.600 --> 14:06.200
l knew the moment l woke up -

14:06.240 --> 14:09.720
locum had to give me an injection to
see me through the vows.

14:09.760 --> 14:13.200
You could see on the video,
l thought l'd married the vicar.

14:13.240 --> 14:15.920
Oops, sorry, sorry...
Iapse of concentration.

14:15.959 --> 14:21.840
Never mind, it's a polyester blend,
chuck it in the wash.

14:24.120 --> 14:26.240
There you go.

14:33.600 --> 14:34.800
Say you're the landlord,

14:34.839 --> 14:37.320
mock up the rent book and they can't
do you for housing benefit.

14:37.359 --> 14:38.360
Nice one.

14:38.399 --> 14:40.520
He'll be a minute -
it's cash in advance.

14:40.560 --> 14:43.360
l told Emily you'd be her brother -
they've got a visit.

14:43.399 --> 14:44.120
They paying?

14:44.160 --> 14:45.960
Fuck om, she's my girlfriend.

14:45.999 --> 14:49.240
- It's a favour.
- l don't mind.

14:49.280 --> 14:51.280
Ne_. >

14:54.399 --> 14:56.600
Now we've been
claiming for our dad...

14:56.640 --> 14:59.760
Cheers.
We'll soon set the buggers right, eh?

14:59.800 --> 15:02.400
You don't mind me borrowing
your husband?

15:02.439 --> 15:06.120
Course you can. He's not, anyway...
my husband that is...

15:06.160 --> 15:08.800
Twisted fuckers are trying to catch
you out - if we eat together...

15:08.839 --> 15:10.880
l'll get a bit of ham in.

15:10.919 --> 15:12.720
Eh, l knew l was right to marry you.

15:12.760 --> 15:15.880
Ta-ra. No Spam!

15:19.039 --> 15:22.480
l don't think l like it, Frank.
Dead man's shoes.

15:22.519 --> 15:25.160
Terms and conditions.
l've been getting half

15:25.200 --> 15:28.200
of Brendan's disability,
it's the least l can do, innit?

15:28.240 --> 15:31.320
Doesn't feel right, cracking on
you're married.

15:31.359 --> 15:33.600
lt's like tempting fate.

15:38.839 --> 15:43.720
So, Miss, erm Jackson, you've been
reported as working behind the bar

15:43.760 --> 15:46.840
here while claiming unemployment
and housing benefit.

15:46.879 --> 15:48.120
Yeah.

15:48.160 --> 15:51.480
Well, she helps me out from
time to time, don't you, honey? >

15:51.519 --> 15:55.280
That's all. Wouldn't your girlfriend
do the same for you?

15:55.319 --> 15:58.600
lf she did, and we were living together,
she'd be unable to claim benefit.

15:58.640 --> 16:02.960
Under current regulations
l'd be assumed to be supporting her.

16:02.999 --> 16:05.960
Well
it's not our problem' that society

16:05.999 --> 16:09.760
won't recognise our relationship.
We know how we feel.

16:09.800 --> 16:12.920
Don't we, Karen, love?

16:24.839 --> 16:28.440
Oh, hi... Mum! He's here!

16:34.800 --> 16:37.920
You've got to be Dom, my brother,
yeah? The one with the ASBO.

16:37.959 --> 16:41.520
He lives in Stockport with me Dad,
but they think he lives with us.

16:41.560 --> 16:44.640
This is Mum, me step-dad Troy...
Lip's little brother.

16:44.680 --> 16:45.400
Hiya, love.

16:45.439 --> 16:48.120
MOBILE BEEPS
You hear that? That is so shit.

16:48.160 --> 16:49.480
Sounds all right to me.

16:49.519 --> 16:51.640
Yeah?
No, can't for a bit.

16:51.680 --> 16:54.920

It's a piece of shit.

16:54.959 --> 16:56.600
l totally fucking hate it.

16:56.640 --> 16:59.400
Saw this 3G mobile when l was in
town...

16:59.439 --> 17:02.320
lt's that lush, dead light but
really good picture quality.

17:02.359 --> 17:05.040
Makes yours look
like a fucking piece of shit.

17:05.079 --> 17:07.319
Better start saving
up then, hadn't yer?

17:07.358 --> 17:10.079
- Will you tell 'im?
- Don't wind her up, Troy.

17:11.640 --> 17:14.079
Have you asked him if
he wants a cappuccino?

17:17.119 --> 17:19.440
No, l'm all right, thanks.

17:19.479 --> 17:21.520
Fuck you looking at?

17:25.680 --> 17:27.440
Thanks very much, Linda.

17:33.080 --> 17:35.120
Here you go.

17:35.160 --> 17:39.360
Cheers, Shirley. Ta very much.

17:39.399 --> 17:41.120

17:41.160 --> 17:42.680
DOOR SLAMS

17:55.359 --> 17:56.840
lt's 3G yeah?

17:56.879 --> 17:58.360
Where's the video bit?

17:58.399 --> 17:59.600
l'll only charge a tenner.

18:02.999 --> 18:05.560
What you roping our
Carl in for, Smeggy?

18:05.600 --> 18:08.360
Nothing.
l was helping him with his homework.

18:08.399 --> 18:12.120
Tell Debbie l won't be in later?
l said l'd do a rent book...

18:12.160 --> 18:15.000
l'm going round Emily's.

18:25.240 --> 18:27.280
Ta-da! Brendan Tyler lives!

18:27.319 --> 18:28.880
Mind out on me floor!

18:33.200 --> 18:35.960
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

18:35.999 --> 18:37.680
Wish me luck, babes.

18:40.280 --> 18:41.480
What's he wearing all that for?

18:41.519 --> 18:44.000
Outside, outside, shoes on me floor!

18:44.039 --> 18:45.120
Oh, right!

18:51.959 --> 18:54.880
Lillian was round this morning.

18:54.919 --> 18:57.000
Frank's asked for some photos
of her...

18:57.039 --> 18:58.520
Can you relax your grip a bit?

18:58.560 --> 19:00.160
Do you want to see why?

19:00.200 --> 19:02.720
Yeah.

19:02.760 --> 19:05.760
Sheila, it's a bit tight.

19:05.800 --> 19:08.120
They reckon it's for the Social.

19:08.160 --> 19:10.080
To add authenticity, Frank says.

19:10.120 --> 19:12.120
Makes you think though, doesn't it?

19:12.160 --> 19:14.400
Made me think anyway, seeing it.

19:14.439 --> 19:16.280
He's never asked me you know, Tony.

19:16.319 --> 19:19.040
That should be me there.
It should be me!

19:19.080 --> 19:20.160
Aggghh, Sheila!

19:20.479 --> 19:22.480
l'm sorry...

19:22.519 --> 19:25.800
lt's just it would be the
happiest day of my life.

19:25.839 --> 19:28.640
Well, maybe you
should talk to Frank about it,

19:28.680 --> 19:30.600
you know, tell him how you feel.

19:30.640 --> 19:33.400
l don't know...
Pop the question yourself.

19:33.439 --> 19:34.520
Oh no.

19:34.560 --> 19:38.080
lt's a man's job to
propose, isn't it?

19:40.479 --> 19:43.440
Eh, minute and a half!
That's a lot better.

19:43.479 --> 19:46.600
OK, you ready?

19:46.640 --> 19:48.880
Ready? Now.

19:48.919 --> 19:52.080
GASPS OF PLEASURE

19:56.720 --> 19:59.040
See? Much better.

20:00.720 --> 20:02.920
Emily, l really wanted to erm..

20:02.959 --> 20:05.080
l found this... l wanted to give it
yer...

20:05.120 --> 20:08.280
For Christ's sake, Carl,
give it a rest will yer!

20:08.319 --> 20:10.120
l weren't doing om!

20:10.160 --> 20:11.760
Sooner you get yourself laid,

20:11.800 --> 20:14.000
sooner l can get a
proper night's sleep!

20:14.039 --> 20:18.240
Whatsername, Jason Digby's
sister, she'll suck anybody om.

20:18.280 --> 20:21.960
Yeah right! Even Jason Digby's
sister's not that fucking desperate.

20:21.999 --> 20:23.440
l weren't doing om!

20:37.959 --> 20:42.040
l erm...wanted to give it yer.
There isn't a video bit.

20:42.080 --> 20:43.240
Just got an upgrade.

20:45.240 --> 20:48.120
Jada might give you a fiver for it.

20:48.160 --> 20:50.760
- It's mine, gimme.
- l want a turn, come on.

20:50.800 --> 20:53.040
You can't just
fucking barge in here..

20:53.080 --> 20:54.960
We're looking for Tom Lawson.

20:54.999 --> 20:57.960
Don't you lot ever talk to each
other? We've sorted it out.

20:57.999 --> 20:59.960
Your son is here, Mrs Lawson?

20:59.999 --> 21:03.880
You're looking at him,
now what's your fucking problem?

21:03.919 --> 21:06.360
- Fuck's that?
- Condition of your bail, Dominic.

21:06.399 --> 21:07.880
Bail...what you on about?

21:07.919 --> 21:10.480
Maybe if you'd turned up
for the hearing.

21:10.519 --> 21:13.680
Don't start on me, you
sanctimonious old twat.

21:13.720 --> 21:16.920
Since the ASBO's failed to
control your son, and he's now been

21:16.959 --> 21:21.640
charged with a crime, the court's
taken the decision to tag him.

21:29.439 --> 21:33.880
You're mental, you are. They keep
them things on for like, months.

21:33.919 --> 21:35.800
Dom'll be back ne_ week.

21:35.839 --> 21:39.320
He's gone to one of them Slawy
countries with his dad,

21:39.359 --> 21:42.520
picking up knock-om DVDs.
Hang on, Ellerby Road.

21:42.560 --> 21:43.600
And?

21:43.640 --> 21:45.560
l'm not allowed - tag'll go om.

21:50.760 --> 21:52.160
What if the tag goes om?

21:52.200 --> 21:58.200
Cops'll get me. l'm supposed to stay
at Emily's so they can check up.

21:58.240 --> 22:00.440
- Dream come true.
- What's that supposed to mean?

22:00.479 --> 22:01.720
You fancy Emily.

22:01.760 --> 22:03.840
Fuck om! Do l fuck!

22:03.879 --> 22:07.560
Lip'll break up with her.
He always does. Or they chuck him.

22:07.600 --> 22:11.240
Bet yer anything. Thing is,
though, a girl like Emily...

22:11.280 --> 22:14.080
Learn to drive before you
set your heart on the Ferrari.

22:14.120 --> 22:16.200
Do you think l need a car?

22:19.879 --> 22:22.920
ln the end right, there's
either chemistry or there isn't.

22:22.959 --> 22:27.800
lt's all to do with the way you
smell - they've tested it on chimps.

22:27.839 --> 22:29.600
Where the fuck are we?

22:29.640 --> 22:31.200
ELECTRONIC TAG BEEPS

22:31.240 --> 22:33.200
Shit!

22:35.160 --> 22:39.160
Frank!
Frank! Sheila! Come over here!

22:39.200 --> 22:41.160
l think you're wanted.

22:41.200 --> 22:44.880
Come over here. Come on, come on.

22:44.919 --> 22:48.640
You all right love?
l've got your money.

22:50.479 --> 22:53.120
Married for 40 years,
never a cross fucking word!

22:56.439 --> 22:57.720
< Sheila...

22:59.640 --> 23:01.160
Sheila.

23:01.680 --> 23:04.160
l don't have my face rubbed in it.

23:04.200 --> 23:06.600
She's not paying me!

23:06.640 --> 23:09.080
lt's got nom to do with you!

23:09.120 --> 23:11.240
No!
Cos l'm nothing, l suppose...

23:11.280 --> 23:13.160
Just your bit on the side!

23:13.200 --> 23:15.680
Course you are!

23:15.720 --> 23:18.800
What? You don't think l'm...

23:20.319 --> 23:22.720
What? Lillian and me...

23:22.760 --> 23:26.280
Fuck om!

23:26.319 --> 23:29.480
Jesus! 20#20 vision, Sheila.

23:29.519 --> 23:33.520
Eh? And l'm in sound mind.

23:33.560 --> 23:36.480
For fuck's sake,
sort yourself out, will yer?

23:36.519 --> 23:39.120
l'm sorry.

23:39.160 --> 23:44.280
Hey. Come on, you know you
shouldn't mix your drinks.

23:44.319 --> 23:46.200
l'm sorry.

23:46.240 --> 23:48.240
l know you'd never be unfaithful.

23:48.280 --> 23:50.840
l trust you with my life.

23:50.879 --> 23:53.920
lt's just all
that being married stum,

23:53.959 --> 23:56.120
having it thrown back in my face.

23:57.680 --> 24:00.200
l know l shouldn't say it, but if l

24:00.240 --> 24:03.240
just had a ring on my finger...

24:04.879 --> 24:06.680
Sheila, love.

24:06.720 --> 24:13.120
You know, fucking hell, you know
there is nothing l would like more

24:13.160 --> 24:15.720
than to call you

24:15.760 --> 24:19.440
Mrs Frank Gallagher.

24:19.479 --> 24:22.000
l don't know, no.

24:22.039 --> 24:26.080
But the... Yeah, yeah,

24:26.120 --> 24:31.280
but no, no, because you're still
married to, you know, Eddie the Owl,

24:31.319 --> 24:35.280
l'm still married to Monica,
plus there's the being dead thing.

24:38.319 --> 24:41.480
We're star-crossed!

24:41.519 --> 24:45.360
The love that dare not speak
its name.

24:46.919 --> 24:49.600
No, l mean l don't blame yer...

24:49.640 --> 24:51.440
AARGHHH!

24:51.479 --> 24:55.440
Does me head in.
There's not a day goes by...

24:55.479 --> 24:57.920
Yeah?

24:57.959 --> 25:00.920
But, you know l love you
to bits, you know that.

25:00.959 --> 25:02.920
Oh, l'm sorry, Frank.

25:02.959 --> 25:04.800
l just thought, you know,

25:04.839 --> 25:06.520
cos you've never asked...

25:14.519 --> 25:16.360
Sheila Jackson,

25:16.399 --> 25:21.080
will you do me the honour
of being my wife?

25:21.120 --> 25:25.960
To have and to hold, for richer
and poorer and all that other shite,

25:25.999 --> 25:28.920
till death do us part...

25:28.959 --> 25:30.080
Yes!

25:30.120 --> 25:35.760
Oh, Frank,
Frank, l love you so much!

25:35.800 --> 25:37.280
l love you so much.

25:37.319 --> 25:39.320
Yeah, yeah, but...

25:39.359 --> 25:43.920
Monica's a mad Catholic bitch,
you know, she'll never let us go...

25:43.959 --> 25:48.280
Let's go and tell everyone!
l'm getting...

25:51.080 --> 25:54.880
The Lord
will sit in judgment, Lillian Tyler!

25:54.919 --> 25:57.320
Early menopause my arse...

25:58.280 --> 26:00.600
What did you omer him, eh?
something he couldn't get at home?

26:00.640 --> 26:01.760
Carol!

26:01.800 --> 26:04.360
The way l'd sumered with
my piles over Veronica!

26:04.399 --> 26:06.880
That was told in confidence!

26:06.919 --> 26:07.880
lt were the 'TOs!

26:07.919 --> 26:09.440
Calm down!

26:09.479 --> 26:13.400
May as well leave it for now, eh?

26:18.359 --> 26:22.360
l can't say l'm overly
impressed with the espresso.

26:22.399 --> 26:25.840
All right, Carl? l've put you
a duvet down in Harley's room.

26:25.879 --> 26:27.840
When do you have to ring in again?

26:27.879 --> 26:29.120
Midnight, then seven.

26:29.160 --> 26:32.560
What's going on? Te_ed Lip
three times this afternoon.

26:32.600 --> 26:35.240
Where the fuck is he?
l haven't seen him for two days.

26:35.280 --> 26:38.160
Dunno. He said he were
coming round here last night.

26:38.200 --> 26:40.920
- Probably got another lass on the go!
- It's not fucking funny!

26:40.959 --> 26:43.200
All right!
l was only having a laugh.

26:43.240 --> 26:46.400
That sensitive.
Always been like that, haven't you?

26:46.439 --> 26:48.960
Must've got it wrong about Lip coming
round. Wasn't really listening.

26:48.999 --> 26:52.640
We really do appreciate this.
Don't we, Emily?

26:54.039 --> 26:55.640
DOOR SLAMS

26:57.160 --> 26:58.880
l can see you looking, Lip.

26:58.919 --> 27:01.080
Don't know why
blokes think you can't!

27:01.120 --> 27:03.400
Sorry. Only...

27:03.439 --> 27:05.960
l thought you were supposed to get
big tits when you've had a baby?

27:05.999 --> 27:07.240
Fuck om! She's on bottles.

27:07.280 --> 27:09.280
Breast-feeding's better.

27:09.319 --> 27:11.200
You do it then. Hurts like fuck.

27:11.240 --> 27:12.840
Not natural, is it?

27:14.519 --> 27:18.240
You can come back and see her.
Just didn't want to wake her up.

27:18.280 --> 27:20.480
Has an eppie every time
l put her in her buggy.

27:20.519 --> 27:22.680
You're all right. l've got to...

27:22.720 --> 27:24.760
l said l'd go see someone.

27:24.800 --> 27:27.680
Oh, yeah?
Still on with Emily Lawson?

27:27.720 --> 27:30.680
lt just, well, suits us both.

27:30.720 --> 27:32.040
We don't talk or om.

27:32.080 --> 27:34.480
To be honest, l think
she finds me a bit boring.

27:34.519 --> 27:36.160
Don't knock her up and all.

27:36.200 --> 27:38.560
Might have learned
me lesson on that one.

27:51.680 --> 27:55.400
The UB6T3. You needed to take
a whole afternoon for that one.

27:55.439 --> 27:59.280
You can see where the biro ran out.
Replaced by the UB96.

27:59.319 --> 28:02.480
Mrs Jackson, l can see
you've kept excellent records.

28:02.519 --> 28:05.080
l'm satisfied everything's
in order at your end.

28:05.120 --> 28:07.720
ls there anything you'd like to ask?

28:07.760 --> 28:11.120
How would notifying you of
a change in my circumstances

28:11.160 --> 28:13.640
amect my eligibility to claim?

28:13.680 --> 28:15.600
lf l were to get married...

28:19.080 --> 28:20.960
(Radio) 'Tony, come in please.

28:20.999 --> 28:23.680
'Domestic at 12 Minton Way.

28:23.720 --> 28:27.240
'Tony, come in please..#

28:27.280 --> 28:28.760
l'll be there in ten, over.

28:46.760 --> 28:48.160
Neighbourhood watch.

28:48.200 --> 28:49.920
ENGINE STARTS

28:49.959 --> 28:52.240
SIREN

28:53.280 --> 28:54.480
CAR SPEEDS AWAY

28:55.999 --> 28:57.240
Don't let Debbie see ya.

28:57.280 --> 28:59.400
She's talking about one bowl
per family member per day.

28:59.439 --> 29:00.560
You bastard!

29:00.600 --> 29:03.440
- This an ambush?
- l saw you with Mandy Maguire...

29:03.479 --> 29:05.600
- So what?
- It's who you've been seeing, innit?

29:05.640 --> 29:07.840
- Seeing, yeah.
- You're a fucking disgrace.

29:07.879 --> 29:09.520
What's it got to do with you?

29:09.560 --> 29:11.600
You're supposed to be
going out with Emily!

29:11.640 --> 29:13.560
The only reason l'm seeing Mandy

29:13.600 --> 29:16.160
is to see my kid.
It's got nothing to do with Emily.

29:16.200 --> 29:17.720
Didn't see ya with a baby today.

29:17.760 --> 29:20.520
Why did you lie
if you're not shagging Mandy?

29:20.560 --> 29:23.480
Why are you keeping it secret
if it's just what you said?

29:23.519 --> 29:25.440
Fuck om!

29:30.200 --> 29:32.480
Hiya.
l've been waiting ages for you.

29:32.519 --> 29:35.400
Thought you could
help me with me maths.

29:35.439 --> 29:36.920
l mean it!

29:40.959 --> 29:43.920
MOANING FROM UPSTAIRS

29:49.479 --> 29:51.160
TURNS UP TV

30:01.479 --> 30:04.960
Dear... Fuck! Erm...

30:04.999 --> 30:08.320
l really wanted to... No, no, no, no.

30:08.359 --> 30:09.960
l erm...

30:10.959 --> 30:13.960
Dear Em...

30:13.999 --> 30:14.920
ALARM

30:14.959 --> 30:16.600
Oh, God! Shit!

30:28.240 --> 30:31.760
Gotta do the tag!
Fuck's sake, let go will yer?

30:31.800 --> 30:34.480
She's ringing the fucking ambulance!
Fuck you do that for?

30:34.519 --> 30:38.400
He knew! l told him, Emily!
No fucking strikes in this house!

30:38.439 --> 30:41.320
You touch another woman,
that's it, you're out!

30:41.359 --> 30:42.600
Didn't have to fucking kill him!

30:42.640 --> 30:44.280
Oh, shit!

30:44.319 --> 30:45.800
He'd never look at another woman.

30:45.839 --> 30:48.240
Then why have we got
crabs in the house?

30:48.280 --> 30:51.400
Someone's been shagging around,
and it's not me.

30:51.439 --> 30:51.960
Yeah, but...

30:51.999 --> 30:53.080
lt's Lip.

30:55.839 --> 30:58.000
Lip's been shagging around.

31:02.039 --> 31:05.760
Fuck's sake... Sheila?

31:05.800 --> 31:07.120
What the fuck's this?

31:07.160 --> 31:10.280
- They've updated all their records.
- You what?

31:10.319 --> 31:14.080
Mr Anastasiou was so helpful. He
said he'd rectify wherever possible.

31:14.120 --> 31:16.360
- Rectify?
- Everything! All your benefits.

31:16.399 --> 31:21.200
And...they're all backdated. Look!

31:25.959 --> 31:27.680
Fucking...

31:30.120 --> 31:31.520
Fucking massive!

31:32.600 --> 31:38.160
Top girl. Fuck me,
pennies from fucking heaven!

31:40.160 --> 31:42.360
l've been on to the registry omice.

31:42.399 --> 31:46.080
They say we have to give them six
weeks notice to post the banns,

31:46.120 --> 31:47.680
but we don't have to have the do there.

31:47.720 --> 31:51.440
That's all right.
l was thinking the Gormley hotel.

31:51.479 --> 31:53.680
They always do such a lovely bumet.

31:54.879 --> 31:56.720
Hang on, rewind.

31:56.760 --> 32:01.880
l'm getting ahead of myself.
Frank, Eddie's agreed to a divorce.

32:03.640 --> 32:07.760
Yeah, but... Last l heard, you
didn't even have an address for him.

32:07.800 --> 32:11.920
Tony gave me a hand.
The DVLC computer.

32:11.959 --> 32:14.160
Eddie's happy to sign
any papers we want.

32:14.200 --> 32:18.840
So that's him, you're alive
and then there's just Monica.

32:18.879 --> 32:22.160
Surely even Monica wouldn't get in
the way of our happiness?

32:22.200 --> 32:24.600
She's a complex character, Monica.

32:24.640 --> 32:27.000
She can't stand in our way, Frank!

32:27.039 --> 32:28.520
SHE CAN'T!

32:28.560 --> 32:30.240
Fucking hell, Sheila! Where's the...

32:30.280 --> 32:32.680
Oh, Frank...

32:32.720 --> 32:34.240
Hang on, Jesus!

32:35.439 --> 32:39.280
Look... Look, l'll get on the
bus and go over there now.

32:40.919 --> 32:45.320
Do it in person.
You know, seize the nettle.

32:47.200 --> 32:50.400
Sheila, love, l'm onto it!

32:54.560 --> 32:55.960
Frank... Frank.

32:55.999 --> 32:57.560
Frank...

32:59.560 --> 33:01.920
All them years!

33:01.959 --> 33:05.760
What's a fucking piece of paper?
You can't just...

33:08.600 --> 33:12.280
Marriage is a solemn state
entered into by a man and a woman.

33:12.319 --> 33:15.880
State, yeah,
yeah, for the fucking state.

33:15.919 --> 33:18.760
Cogs in the fucking wheel.

33:20.319 --> 33:22.520
Plus, the whole thing costs
a fucking mint.

33:22.560 --> 33:25.880
Keeps it all going.
It's an industry.

33:25.919 --> 33:28.920
Classic. ''l do.'' And ''You're fucked.''

33:28.959 --> 33:31.680
And all the talking...

33:45.479 --> 33:47.960
What've you been
saying to our Emily?

33:47.999 --> 33:50.840
Fuck all. l just said
her boyfriend's a scally.

33:50.879 --> 33:52.880
He fucking is, isn't he?

33:52.919 --> 33:55.280
You haven't been using them towels
on the landing?

33:55.319 --> 33:56.840
l had a shower.

33:56.879 --> 33:58.920
l put 'em out for a boil wash.
They're crawling.

33:58.959 --> 34:01.280
You can tell your
brother he's fucking dead.

34:01.319 --> 34:04.920
He can pay for the stum from
the fucking chemist and all.

34:18.839 --> 34:20.800
l'm really sorry, Emily. It's just,

34:20.839 --> 34:24.120
Lip deserves a twatting.
l tried telling him.

34:24.159 --> 34:27.480
You should be with someone who
does stum for yer, gives you

34:27.518 --> 34:29.400
loads of presents and stum.

34:29.438 --> 34:32.719
You're gorgeous.
And l know you understand stum,

34:32.760 --> 34:36.159
about people, cos you feel things,
like what l do.

34:36.199 --> 34:39.520
There's all this stum l could talk
to you about, stum in me head...

34:39.560 --> 34:41.040
Yeah, Carl, can you just fuck om?

34:41.080 --> 34:42.199
Who's he? >

34:42.239 --> 34:46.280
Push om, will yer? And tell Lip
not to bother calling me again.

34:48.719 --> 34:49.880
Hiya.

35:23.240 --> 35:24.640
ALARM

35:32.319 --> 35:34.520
Your brother at home then, Carl?

35:36.800 --> 35:40.240
Troy! Troy!
It weren't Lip, it were Emily!

35:40.280 --> 35:42.280
Troy!

35:42.319 --> 35:45.720
Fuck it! You can't!

35:47.479 --> 35:49.400
Stop! Troy, stop, it weren't him.

35:49.439 --> 35:51.560
lt was Emily with the crabs!
She's a slag.

35:51.600 --> 35:54.080
She's been shagging another lad,
with a car.

35:54.120 --> 35:55.800
You calling my missus's
Iass a slag?

35:55.839 --> 35:57.040
She's a fucking slag!

35:57.080 --> 35:58.280
No, stop it!

35:58.319 --> 36:00.480
What are you doing?
Leave 'em alone!!

36:00.519 --> 36:02.120
Fuck om out of it, love.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.000
l said, ''Leave 'em alone.''

36:04.039 --> 36:06.640
Fuck om, before you get hurt.
It's none of your business!

36:06.680 --> 36:09.640
l'm warning you. If you don't
fuck om, l'm calling me dad.

36:09.680 --> 36:11.880
Who's your dad, love?
Patrick fucking Maguire?

36:11.919 --> 36:14.800
That's right. Mandy Maguire.

36:17.200 --> 36:20.280
Suppose if he's not around,
one of me brothers might be free.

36:20.319 --> 36:22.120
No, no, you're all right.

36:22.160 --> 36:23.480
Sorry.

36:24.519 --> 36:26.000
Sorry, love.

36:33.999 --> 36:36.560
You never learn, do ya!

36:36.600 --> 36:40.640
l didn't do om! Somebody
told him l was shagging around.

36:46.519 --> 36:49.200
- Fucking arsewipe!
- l thought you were shagging Mandy!

36:49.240 --> 36:52.880
Even if l did, l can't believe
you'd land me in the shit like that!

36:52.919 --> 36:56.240
- Makes a change from you doing it!
- Hey, hey, come on.

36:56.280 --> 36:59.840
- He could've fucking killed me!
- l thought you'd given everyone crabs!

37:01.600 --> 37:04.240
What? Lip gave Carl crabs?

37:09.720 --> 37:11.880
BABY CRIES

37:19.439 --> 37:23.200
You must have known. l was just
beginning to worry about my tagine.

37:23.240 --> 37:27.360
They say you can't overcook a braise,
but there are limits.

37:27.399 --> 37:30.440
l thought we'd have
a little celebration.

37:43.959 --> 37:46.320
Tell me if l'm being over the top,

37:46.359 --> 37:48.800
but if you can't be over the top
for a wedding...

37:48.839 --> 37:52.240
l've got my heart set on a croque en
bouche, instead of a fruit cake.

37:52.280 --> 37:54.400
Look, spun sugar all over.

37:54.439 --> 37:57.520
Some people are intimidated
by choux pastry,

37:57.560 --> 38:00.200
but actually it's quite
straightfoM/ard.

38:03.439 --> 38:05.680
(Slurred) She wasn't in.

38:07.720 --> 38:10.440
Monica.

38:10.479 --> 38:13.600
They were both out as it happens.

38:13.640 --> 38:16.000
l see.

38:16.039 --> 38:19.080
lt's all right.
Try again tomorrow, eh?

38:19.120 --> 38:23.240
We've got all the time in the world,
haven't we?

38:25.160 --> 38:26.600
l know, Frank.

38:28.760 --> 38:32.520
l may be stupid, but l'm not blind.

38:32.560 --> 38:34.400
No, yeah, right...

38:34.439 --> 38:35.920
l do know.

38:38.999 --> 38:41.520
To tell you the truth,
if l was you, l'm not

38:41.560 --> 38:43.280
sure l'd want to marry me either.

38:43.319 --> 38:47.400
l thought, just this once...
You know what l'm like.

38:47.439 --> 38:49.040
Had it on my school report once.

38:49.080 --> 38:52.520
''lf Sheila had her head in her books
as much as she does in the clouds,

38:52.560 --> 38:54.880
''she'd be top of the class.''

38:57.839 --> 39:00.160
Never felt like daydreaming.

39:00.200 --> 39:02.840
Just felt like l was
waiting for something.

39:02.879 --> 39:05.520
l never knew what.

39:05.560 --> 39:10.160
Then you came along,
and l knew just like that...

39:11.760 --> 39:13.400
Sorry.

39:16.439 --> 39:20.320
There's a raspberry pannacotta
in the fridge if you've got room.

39:20.359 --> 39:23.160
lt's nicest if you bring
it to room temperature.

39:26.600 --> 39:28.920
l'm a bit shattered.

40:13.680 --> 40:15.800
SOBBING

40:39.200 --> 40:40.880
'Yeah, hello#

40:40.919 --> 40:43.080
Oh, hello Shre... Norma love.

40:43.120 --> 40:44.880
lt's Frank, Frank Gallagher.

40:44.919 --> 40:46.400
'What the fuck...
What did you just call me?'

40:46.439 --> 40:47.400
Don't start!

40:47.439 --> 40:51.200
'What did you call me, you lanky
streak of piss? What do you want?'

40:51.240 --> 40:52.960
Can l have a word with Monica?

40:52.999 --> 40:55.360
'Oh, for fuck's sake#

40:55.399 --> 40:57.200
Here you go, fellas.

40:57.240 --> 41:00.680
No, put your money away.
All drinks are on Frank Gallagher.

41:00.720 --> 41:02.960
lt's real diamonette, unique design.

41:02.999 --> 41:06.720
See how the stones catch the light,
giving it an e_ra dimension?

41:06.760 --> 41:07.800
Did you get it om QVC?

41:07.839 --> 41:10.280
Yes! Frank said
l could take my pick!

41:10.319 --> 41:11.320
lt's gorgeous.

41:11.359 --> 41:12.360
Look.

41:15.720 --> 41:18.360
Fuck me, look at him, will yer?

41:18.399 --> 41:23.400
Bit weird, innit? l mean,
Mum and Dad getting a divorce?

41:23.439 --> 41:25.880
Compared to what? Crop circles?

41:25.919 --> 41:28.520
Dad living with Sheila?
Mum and Norma?

41:28.560 --> 41:32.400
Yeah, l know, but now they're
never gonna get back together.

41:36.919 --> 41:39.480
Hey, did you happen to see

41:39.519 --> 41:45.240
The most beautiful girl
in the world?

41:45.280 --> 41:52.520
And if you did, was she crying?

41:52.560 --> 41:54.640
Normal service has resumed.

41:54.680 --> 41:56.480
Fortunately.

41:56.519 --> 42:00.520
Mum shagged me Uncle Roy at me
Auntie Cath's funeral. l reminded her.

42:00.560 --> 42:05.880
Well, it sort of put it in its place,
me dad shagging Lillian.

42:05.919 --> 42:07.680
lt was like he was retaliating.

42:11.560 --> 42:14.560
We're pulling out. Had a call.
Head omice has costed it out.

42:14.600 --> 42:17.440
We're paying you lot
more than when we started.

42:17.479 --> 42:19.600
My number's on there.

42:19.640 --> 42:22.160
You can, you know,
bring your friend.

42:22.200 --> 42:25.760
What are you expecting,
a pillow fight?

42:25.800 --> 42:29.080
Don't do us any favours,
you spineless little prick.

42:29.120 --> 42:32.960
We're dykes, not fucking wank fodder
for pathetic little twats like you!

42:32.999 --> 42:34.680
Go home to your internet, eh?

42:34.720 --> 42:40.280
Oh, and by the way,
my cock's twice the size of yours!

42:40.319 --> 42:41.680
You tell him. >

42:43.399 --> 42:46.320
CHEERING

42:54.439 --> 42:57.840
Kev.

42:57.879 --> 42:59.600
(Frank) Bonny kiddie.

42:59.640 --> 43:00.800
Takes after her dad.

43:02.600 --> 43:03.720
You know, Phillip...

43:03.760 --> 43:08.160
Phillip...
It's a very special feeling.

43:08.200 --> 43:10.120
Yeah, everyone says that.

43:10.160 --> 43:14.440
