02:02.813 --> 02:04.746
Fear.

02:04.748 --> 02:09.118
<i>Fear is something
that everyone experiences.</i>

02:09.120 --> 02:13.422
<i>Fear is a feeling
that we all know.</i>

02:13.424 --> 02:16.895
<i>For me, a fear
that shaped my life was...</i>

02:20.732 --> 02:22.564
God, that sucks.

02:30.542 --> 02:32.575
"Recount a time
when you faced a fear,

02:32.577 --> 02:34.177
challenge or failure.

02:34.179 --> 02:37.082
How did it define you,
or how did you overcome it?"

02:52.530 --> 02:54.265
Hello?

02:55.835 --> 02:57.570
Hello?

03:08.848 --> 03:10.547
Tyler? What are you doing?

03:10.549 --> 03:12.649
Are you crazy?
My mom is gonna hear you.

03:12.651 --> 03:14.219
You see this mask?

03:14.221 --> 03:15.519
Got it on sale.

03:15.521 --> 03:16.755
Very scary.

03:16.757 --> 03:18.388
Sorry.
I was in the neighborhood.

03:18.390 --> 03:21.092
- I texted you like 10 times.
- I told you my phone's off.

03:21.094 --> 03:23.628
If I miss this deadline,
I don't get into Columbia.

03:23.630 --> 03:25.964
You'll be here with me
the next four years.

03:25.966 --> 03:30.034
Consider me your safety school.
Close by, good parties...

03:30.036 --> 03:33.738
Oh, really. Do you also offer
a creative-writing program?

03:33.740 --> 03:37.209
Oh, I'm super creative.
Look, I got you a care package.

03:37.211 --> 03:41.379
- Pringles. And a little bit of Red Bull.
- Heh.

03:41.381 --> 03:43.251
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

03:46.254 --> 03:47.822
You are so busted.

03:48.890 --> 03:51.023
- So, so busted.
- I've got it.

03:51.025 --> 03:53.092
Mom,
this is not what it looks like.

03:53.094 --> 03:55.961
No, I know what it is.
I heard the entire thing.

03:55.963 --> 03:57.897
Do people
not whisper anymore?

03:57.899 --> 04:00.733
"Hey, I brought Pringles
and Red Bull."

04:00.735 --> 04:03.435
"You better be quiet
'cause my mom will hear us."

04:04.672 --> 04:06.405
Tyler, go home.

04:06.407 --> 04:09.042
Okay.
Uh, just to clarify,

04:09.044 --> 04:11.443
do you mean back out the window
or out the front?

04:11.445 --> 04:12.913
Okay, I'll use the window.

04:12.915 --> 04:14.781
Sorry, Sarah,
I'll see you tomorrow.

04:14.783 --> 04:16.517
Ooh! I'm good.

04:17.584 --> 04:19.886
Ah! Still good!

04:19.887 --> 04:22.222
- Go to bed.
- Mom, I can explain.

04:22.224 --> 04:24.591
We'll discuss this
in the morning.

04:24.593 --> 04:27.194
- Sam is gonna love this.
- You go to bed too.

04:27.196 --> 04:29.029
- What'd I do?
- I don't need a wingman.

04:29.031 --> 04:31.598
- Okay. Going to bed.
- Hmph.

04:39.508 --> 04:40.944
Ow.

04:43.146 --> 04:45.112
You need to stop
electrocuting yourself

04:45.114 --> 04:47.615
- and eat your breakfast.
- Mom, this is due tomorrow,

04:47.617 --> 04:49.517
and it's worth 50 percent
of my grade.

04:49.519 --> 04:52.153
How about you eat 50 percent
of your eggs?

04:53.790 --> 04:55.156
Sonny, seriously?

04:55.158 --> 04:57.058
Sorry. I'm getting close.

04:58.361 --> 05:00.695
Coming.

05:00.697 --> 05:03.131
Coming!

05:03.133 --> 05:04.632
Morning, Ms. Quinn.

05:04.634 --> 05:06.467
- Good morning, Sam.
- How you doing?

05:06.469 --> 05:08.904
Kathy! Thank
you for taking Sam.

05:08.906 --> 05:11.173
We'll be back in three days.
We owe you.

05:11.175 --> 05:12.440
You definitely do.

05:14.477 --> 05:16.278
Sonny!
Grab your backpack.

05:16.280 --> 05:18.347
Sarah, let's go!
I've got an errand to run

05:18.349 --> 05:20.217
- on the way to school.
- Coming!

05:21.785 --> 05:23.819
My condolences on your bust
last night.

05:23.821 --> 05:26.021
Good thing I'm here,
in case any other dudes

05:26.023 --> 05:27.656
try to climb
through your window.

05:27.658 --> 05:29.424
Sonny. I'm gonna kill you.

05:29.426 --> 05:32.061
Kill him in the car.
Okay? Go, go, go.

05:40.205 --> 05:42.972
Faster, faster.

05:42.974 --> 05:46.843
Hey, Kathy.
Hey, kids. Heh, heh.

05:46.845 --> 05:48.410
Mr. Chu.

05:48.412 --> 05:51.047
Wow, you practically got
a theme park here.

05:51.049 --> 05:52.749
Check this out.

05:55.153 --> 05:57.954
Oh, my... Oh! Whoa!

05:57.956 --> 06:01.457
It's like being in the movies!

06:01.459 --> 06:04.194
I'm gonna have these puppies
up and running in no time.

06:04.196 --> 06:05.695
You know, for the kids.

06:05.697 --> 06:08.866
- Ha-ha-ha. Okay.
- All right. Bye.

06:08.868 --> 06:10.768
He doesn't actually have kids,
does he?

06:10.770 --> 06:12.069
No, he does not.

06:12.071 --> 06:14.571
Ooh!

06:16.509 --> 06:19.111
All right, everybody,
let's make this quick.

06:20.780 --> 06:23.580
You can each pick out a pumpkin
to carve if you want to,

06:23.582 --> 06:25.783
but meet me at
the register in five minutes,

06:25.785 --> 06:26.953
- all right?
- Okay.

06:27.787 --> 06:29.887
Alrighty.

06:29.889 --> 06:31.555
Right here? Really?

06:31.557 --> 06:36.096
Yes, here. Everywhere.
It's called marketing.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.732
Anything you wanna
say to me?

06:40.734 --> 06:44.636
Mom... Mom, I was
working all night. I swear.

06:44.638 --> 06:47.472
I swear,
Tyler just snuck over and...

06:47.474 --> 06:49.541
I've just been so stuck
on this essay...

06:49.543 --> 06:52.043
You're a great writer.
You always have been.

06:52.045 --> 06:54.646
When you have to sum up
your whole life in one essay,

06:54.648 --> 06:56.815
it all just sounds so...

06:56.817 --> 06:58.384
unimpressive.

06:58.386 --> 07:02.822
Honey. I think you're very
impressive and very capable.

07:02.824 --> 07:04.090
You do?

07:04.092 --> 07:05.424
Thank you.

07:05.426 --> 07:06.792
I do.

07:06.794 --> 07:09.028
Which is why I need you
to watch Sonny and Sam

07:09.030 --> 07:10.796
this week
while I'm working doubles.

07:10.798 --> 07:13.165
Mom! No!
My essay is due Friday.

07:13.167 --> 07:15.801
Sonny's bigger than me.
He doesn't need a babysitter.

07:15.803 --> 07:20.273
Ha, ha. Have you seen what he
blows up when he's supervised?

07:20.275 --> 07:22.942
Hon, I know you're focused
on getting out of here.

07:22.944 --> 07:24.977
But if I don't cover
these shifts at work,

07:24.979 --> 07:26.246
I could lose my job.

07:26.248 --> 07:28.783
I need to know
I can count on you.

07:32.221 --> 07:35.188
Okay. Fine.

07:35.190 --> 07:37.657
- Really?
- Yes, really.

07:37.659 --> 07:41.895
Well, you have earned yourself
some corn cushions, little lady.

07:41.897 --> 07:43.196
Really? Mom.

07:45.034 --> 07:48.302
You're looking real nice today.

07:48.304 --> 07:52.206
Thank you. Heh, heh.
Blue is very in this year.

07:52.208 --> 07:55.276
- I see you got the memo.
- I guess we're in the know.

07:56.513 --> 07:58.379
Okay. Hey, you know,
the adult diapers

07:58.381 --> 08:00.281
are 2-for-1
if you wanna grab another.

08:00.283 --> 08:02.183
- I just need one today.
- Okay. All right.

08:02.185 --> 08:04.519
I don't need them.
They're for the nursing home

08:04.521 --> 08:05.920
- where I work.
- Of course.

08:05.922 --> 08:08.189
- I... I don't... Heh, heh.
- Hey, no judgment.

08:08.191 --> 08:10.858
- Um, okay. Heh, heh.
- I use a toilet. Heh, heh.

08:10.860 --> 08:15.029
All right. Well, hopefully,
I'll, uh, see you around soon.

08:15.031 --> 08:17.832
Yeah. Yeah.
Thanks for checking me out.

08:17.834 --> 08:20.335
Ringing up my purchases.
You know.

08:20.337 --> 08:21.969
Yes. Yeah. Well, both.

08:21.971 --> 08:24.572
- Yeah. Heh.
- I'll just get my diapers and go.

08:24.574 --> 08:25.840
Yeah.

08:25.842 --> 08:27.076
Happy Halloween!

08:33.049 --> 08:34.383
Yeah, I can help you.

08:34.385 --> 08:35.683
Hey, wait up!

08:39.423 --> 08:41.756
Oh, dude,
science fair sign-ups.

08:41.759 --> 08:43.792
If I can just get
my Tesla Tower to work,

08:43.794 --> 08:45.227
easily win. It'd be so cool.

08:45.229 --> 08:47.096
What do you mean?
You're already cool.

08:47.098 --> 08:50.400
We are treasure hunters.
People respect us around here.

08:52.137 --> 08:54.070
- Ew.
- Hey, Junk Bros.

08:54.072 --> 08:57.107
Spit wads? What are you, 9?

08:57.109 --> 08:58.775
What'd you say?

08:58.777 --> 09:00.910
Sam, what are you doing?

09:00.912 --> 09:02.848
I got this.

09:07.752 --> 09:09.453
You know,

09:09.455 --> 09:12.523
we were gonna TP Principal
Harrison's house tomorrow night.

09:12.525 --> 09:14.358
But now,
I think I'm just gonna spend

09:14.360 --> 09:16.360
the whole night
chasing you guys around.

09:16.362 --> 09:19.296
Hey. Boys,
move it or you're tardy.

09:19.298 --> 09:20.897
Of course, Ms. Hoover.

09:20.899 --> 09:23.534
I was just extolling
to my good friends Sam and Sonny

09:23.536 --> 09:26.070
my deep love for homework
and all things learning.

09:26.072 --> 09:27.306
Get to class.

09:31.878 --> 09:33.112
Yeah.

09:34.046 --> 09:36.080
What a jerk.

09:36.082 --> 09:37.681
I'd like to check
this book out, please.

09:37.683 --> 09:39.484
And you are...?

09:39.486 --> 09:41.486
Tyler Mitchell.

09:41.488 --> 09:45.022
Okay, Tyler Mitchell.

09:45.024 --> 09:47.425
Oh. Yeah, you have four books

09:47.427 --> 09:49.860
you haven't returned
since sophomore year.

09:49.862 --> 09:51.829
And your account is frozen.

09:51.831 --> 09:53.098
Damn.

09:53.100 --> 09:55.033
It's gonna cost 40 bucks
to unfreeze it.

09:55.035 --> 09:57.002
I just spent it
on tickets for us

09:57.004 --> 09:59.037
to see DJ Bisky
at the Den tonight.

09:59.039 --> 10:01.339
You have to come.
You can't say no.

10:01.341 --> 10:03.609
My way of saying sorry
for getting you busted.

10:03.611 --> 10:05.844
I-I can't.
My mom is making me

10:05.846 --> 10:08.614
watch my stupid brother
all week and his friend...

10:08.616 --> 10:11.250
Come on. Don't wait for college
to start having fun.

10:11.252 --> 10:12.652
Show starts at 8.

10:12.654 --> 10:15.754
Get your brother
a babysitter.

10:22.197 --> 10:25.366
Okay. Sam, what do you think?

10:26.367 --> 10:28.534
Nice. Looks just like you.

10:32.207 --> 10:33.676
Hello.

10:35.376 --> 10:37.843
Yeah. Yeah, you're speaking
to a Junk Brother.

10:37.845 --> 10:40.713
Yes, ma'am. This afternoon?

10:40.715 --> 10:42.848
Let me check with my associate.

10:42.850 --> 10:44.850
- Hang up on her.
- This is our opportunity.

10:44.852 --> 10:46.919
- We're too busy. Stop it.
- We're doing this.

10:46.921 --> 10:49.590
I have my Tesla Tower project,
I have algebra. No way.

10:49.592 --> 10:51.592
- Fine, fine, fine! Whatever.
- Sam.

10:51.594 --> 10:53.195
All right. Fine.

10:54.597 --> 10:57.331
You are in luck.
Yeah, we can squeeze you in.

10:57.333 --> 11:00.367
24 Ashley Lane?

11:00.369 --> 11:01.935
No, no problem. No problem.

11:01.937 --> 11:05.274
Yeah. Fear not, ma'am.
Junk is our middle name.

11:07.910 --> 11:10.311
"Junk is our..."?
Do you even hear yourself?

11:10.313 --> 11:14.082
Get your shoes on.
It's time to get rich!

11:14.084 --> 11:16.251
I already have my shoes on.

11:38.442 --> 11:41.644
I guess this is it.
24 Ashley Lane.

11:41.646 --> 11:44.146
Twenty-four is the number
of people murdered here.

11:44.148 --> 11:45.913
All right, Sonny.

11:45.915 --> 11:47.549
Let's do this.

11:58.829 --> 12:01.700
Hey. I don't like the way
those things are looking at us.

12:04.736 --> 12:08.039
We're treasure hunters, Sonny,
remember. Come on.

12:28.160 --> 12:29.495
Hello?

12:39.439 --> 12:40.606
Some treasure.

12:42.542 --> 12:44.410
This place
is definitely haunted.

12:48.047 --> 12:51.282
Dude, there's more stuff
over here. Come on.

12:51.284 --> 12:54.218
This room's
even worse.

12:54.220 --> 12:56.387
Come on, Sonny,
it's not that bad.

12:56.389 --> 12:58.525
There is nothing
to be afraid of.

13:07.501 --> 13:09.568
Who stuffs a cat?

13:09.570 --> 13:12.106
How much are they paying us
for this?

13:15.642 --> 13:17.709
Can't believe you said
we'd work for free.

13:17.711 --> 13:19.378
Not for free.
The lady said

13:19.380 --> 13:21.513
we could keep any junk
we don't throw away.

13:21.515 --> 13:23.649
Some of that stuff
can have monetary value.

13:23.651 --> 13:25.785
You know what else
has monetary value, Sam?

13:25.787 --> 13:28.322
- Actual money.
- Just start cleaning. Come on.

13:32.059 --> 13:34.694
Found some more stuff
in the attic.

13:34.696 --> 13:37.866
- Okay, what do we got?
- Maybe this is worth something.

13:41.536 --> 13:42.835
It's stuck.

13:57.118 --> 13:59.420
Dude, I think
we just found a treasure chest!

13:59.422 --> 14:01.555
- Go get it.
- Jackpot!

14:01.557 --> 14:04.291
This is amazing.
It's like a whole room in here.

14:04.293 --> 14:06.562
I told you.
We come here, we find treasure.

14:09.064 --> 14:11.465
Help me with this.
I bet this thing

14:11.467 --> 14:13.802
is filled with gold
and diamonds and Bitcoins.

14:13.804 --> 14:16.203
Uh, you know Bitcoins
are cryptocurrency, right?

14:16.205 --> 14:18.405
It's not real coins,
it's virtual coins.

14:18.407 --> 14:21.275
It's really cool. It starts
with a process called mining...

14:21.277 --> 14:23.243
Stop being a nerd
for a second and help.

14:23.245 --> 14:25.279
- Yeah, sorry.
- Thank you. Here.

14:25.281 --> 14:28.885
All right. You ready?
Three, two, and...

14:32.456 --> 14:33.623
What?

14:37.694 --> 14:39.561
It's locked.

14:39.563 --> 14:41.362
Who would lock a book?

14:41.364 --> 14:43.066
Here's a key.

14:46.737 --> 14:48.771
Oh, man.

14:53.243 --> 14:55.276
Well, what's in it?

14:55.278 --> 14:57.348
Nothing.
It's just a beat-up old book.

14:59.015 --> 15:00.785
Doesn't have a title page.

15:03.019 --> 15:05.421
- So much for treasure.
- Well, look.

15:05.423 --> 15:07.857
We still have all this stuff.
This is a good haul.

15:07.859 --> 15:09.358
Just grab the book anyway.

15:09.360 --> 15:11.527
- It's gotta be worth something.
- Yeah.

15:16.200 --> 15:18.804
Sam. Sam, turn around.

15:22.407 --> 15:24.343
Where did that come from?

15:39.758 --> 15:43.161
"My name is Slappy.
What's yours?"

15:46.465 --> 15:49.332
Wait, I think it says something
on the back.

15:49.334 --> 15:54.039
<i>"Karru marri odonna
loma molonu karrano."</i>

15:57.577 --> 15:59.176
He's so creepy.

15:59.178 --> 16:01.479
It's kind of like he's alive.

16:01.481 --> 16:03.180
I don't think
anything's been alive

16:03.182 --> 16:04.582
in this house
since that cat.

16:04.584 --> 16:06.717
I mean, look at this place.

16:06.719 --> 16:08.754
- But I'm alive now!
- Aah!

16:08.756 --> 16:11.155
Oh, Sonny, just give me a kiss.
Just one smooch.

16:11.157 --> 16:13.357
- That's not funny.
- Yes, it is. It's hilarious.

16:13.359 --> 16:15.426
It's a business.
We're running a business.

16:15.428 --> 16:16.762
Take this more seriously.

16:16.764 --> 16:18.497
It's too easy, Sonny.
Come on, man.

16:18.499 --> 16:20.064
Hey, I'm taking him.

16:20.066 --> 16:22.066
Don't know why
you took that thing.

16:22.068 --> 16:24.201
- What do you mean? He's awesome.
- Whatever.

16:24.203 --> 16:27.873
Hey, it's the Junk Sisters!

16:27.875 --> 16:29.575
Oh, great.

16:29.577 --> 16:32.077
Well, at least we know
our marketing's working.

16:32.079 --> 16:34.881
No teacher around
to save you now.

16:34.883 --> 16:37.149
Hey, are you wearing
my old sweater

16:37.151 --> 16:38.383
from my grandma's yard sale?

16:39.653 --> 16:40.789
Leave us alone.

16:42.156 --> 16:43.556
Okay.

16:43.558 --> 16:45.692
Give me back my sweater
and I'll let you go.

16:45.694 --> 16:46.926
Really?

16:46.928 --> 16:48.530
Unless you want
your face punched.

16:51.366 --> 16:53.435
Whatever.

16:55.971 --> 16:57.238
And your box.

17:00.809 --> 17:04.377
Fine. Just take it.

17:04.378 --> 17:05.712
Yo, what we got?

17:05.714 --> 17:07.915
- What's this?
- Let's see. Old radio.

17:07.916 --> 17:10.282
- Is that a ruler?
- That's a dog toy.

17:10.285 --> 17:12.653
A stupid book.

17:12.655 --> 17:14.420
Wow.

17:14.422 --> 17:16.957
Great business
you guys are running.

17:16.959 --> 17:18.892
Heh. Your turn.

17:18.894 --> 17:21.428
No. No,
I'm not giving you my box.

17:21.430 --> 17:24.565
Sam, just give it to him.
I like my face unpunched.

17:24.567 --> 17:26.636
No way.
We worked for this stuff.

17:27.703 --> 17:29.470
- Hey, Tommy!
- Oh!

17:29.472 --> 17:31.205
- Look at that.
- Tommy, give him back!

17:31.207 --> 17:33.707
Want your doll? You dress him up
when you get home?

17:33.709 --> 17:35.542
Tommy, this isn't funny.

17:35.544 --> 17:36.679
Sam...

17:38.214 --> 17:39.648
What the...?

17:46.657 --> 17:47.824
What is going on?

17:49.326 --> 17:50.759
Tommy, pull up your pants!

17:50.761 --> 17:52.227
They're stuck.

17:52.229 --> 17:54.462
Thank you very much.
Sonny, we need to go!

17:54.464 --> 17:58.266
Go! Go! Go! No, don't touch
my underwear! God! Stop!

17:58.268 --> 18:01.202
No! Go get them!
No! Go get them!

18:01.204 --> 18:03.672
- Go!
- Okay, okay, okay!

18:11.115 --> 18:12.848
Better pedal faster!

18:12.850 --> 18:14.150
Oh, no.

18:14.152 --> 18:15.985
Come on,
don't make it easy for us!

18:15.987 --> 18:17.218
We need to go!

18:17.220 --> 18:18.988
We're gonna get you, man!

18:18.990 --> 18:20.391
They're gaining on us!

18:22.460 --> 18:23.594
Faster!

18:35.306 --> 18:38.175
- What just happened?
- I have no idea.

18:38.177 --> 18:41.144
Get back here, you two!

18:41.146 --> 18:44.014
Ah.
Why does this keep happening?

18:44.016 --> 18:46.516
Sarah!
You won't believe what happened.

18:46.518 --> 18:48.285
You are never
going to believe this.

18:48.287 --> 18:50.520
We were in this crazy,
abandoned, creepy house

18:50.522 --> 18:52.889
and found this fireplace,
which had a cat on it I twisted.

18:52.891 --> 18:55.159
It went to a secret
compartment that opened.

18:55.161 --> 18:56.827
Then there was a treasure chest.

18:56.829 --> 18:59.997
Okay, but long story short,
we found...

18:59.999 --> 19:01.700
this guy!

19:03.268 --> 19:04.534
Th-this guy.

19:04.536 --> 19:06.838
This... guy.

19:06.840 --> 19:10.441
Wow. It's like you're actively
trying not to be cool.

19:10.443 --> 19:13.711
Here. Mom specifically said
you should fold the laundry.

19:13.713 --> 19:17.218
I'll be in my room if you
need me, but do not need me.

19:21.755 --> 19:23.588
Hey, Sarah?

19:23.590 --> 19:26.691
This specifically says you are
supposed to fold the laundry.

19:27.928 --> 19:29.194
Sarah.

19:41.442 --> 19:44.743
What am I doing?

19:44.745 --> 19:47.379
We already banned jumping.

19:47.381 --> 19:50.716
I banned sucking, yet here you are.
Now, come on.

19:50.718 --> 19:53.852
Hey! Yes!

19:53.854 --> 19:55.287
Yes!

19:55.289 --> 19:56.755
It's 4 to 1.
Why are you celebrating?

19:56.757 --> 19:58.892
Scoring is a reason
for celebration.

19:58.894 --> 20:00.994
Bye, I'm leaving!

20:00.996 --> 20:03.596
- Where you going?
- Out. I'll be back by 10.

20:03.598 --> 20:05.598
If Mom calls,
tell her I'm in the shower.

20:05.600 --> 20:08.168
You were gonna help me
with my science presentation.

20:08.170 --> 20:09.435
There's two dummies
on the couch.

20:09.437 --> 20:10.670
Practice on one of them.

20:10.672 --> 20:12.438
Ouch.

20:45.242 --> 20:46.375
Tyler!

21:44.370 --> 21:46.704
All right, there we go.

21:49.909 --> 21:52.244
Okay. And...

21:54.412 --> 21:59.249
Sergeant, your orders
are to guard this porch.

21:59.251 --> 22:01.451
It was more than
a hundred years ago

22:01.453 --> 22:03.720
when Nikola Tesla
first lit up the sky

22:03.722 --> 22:05.356
over Wardenclyffe, New York.

22:05.358 --> 22:07.090
Tesla wanted to create a world

22:07.092 --> 22:08.926
where anything
could be transmitted

22:08.928 --> 22:10.427
through giant electric towers:

22:10.429 --> 22:14.631
Power, sound,
maybe even brain waves.

22:14.633 --> 22:17.601
It was like
the original Wi-Fi.

22:17.603 --> 22:21.940
But suddenly and mysteriously,
he shut down his lab in 1908.

22:21.942 --> 22:24.709
His tower
never lit up the sky again.

22:24.711 --> 22:25.944
Until...

22:25.946 --> 22:27.211
today!

22:27.213 --> 22:28.782
May I have a volunteer?

22:29.883 --> 22:31.883
You, sir, in the gray suit.

22:31.885 --> 22:35.455
Hold this
and prepare to be amazed.

22:37.090 --> 22:38.589
I present to you all:

22:38.591 --> 22:39.759
Tesla!

22:50.637 --> 22:52.705
Don't give me that look.

22:52.707 --> 22:54.907
I'm trying
to bring back your tower.

22:56.243 --> 22:58.277
Bravo.

22:58.279 --> 23:02.081
I, for one, think it's
an electrifying presentation.

23:06.153 --> 23:09.224
Sam. I'm not
gonna fall for that again.

23:10.925 --> 23:13.159
Ha-ha-ha. Very funny.

23:13.161 --> 23:14.827
It's like a microphone?

23:14.829 --> 23:17.529
You're talking through
your cell phone or something?

23:17.531 --> 23:20.300
Sam.
Sam, it's a stupid prank.

23:20.302 --> 23:22.838
You ever heard
of personal space? Mm!

23:33.181 --> 23:34.981
How are you talking
to me right now?

23:34.983 --> 23:39.186
You brought me to life.
Don't you remember, Sonny?

23:39.188 --> 23:40.954
- Sam?
- What?

23:40.956 --> 23:42.822
What's the problem?

23:42.824 --> 23:44.524
Just come up here. Please.

23:44.526 --> 23:46.693
Dude, I told you,
I don't care about Tesla.

23:46.695 --> 23:48.829
- Right now, Sam.
- Fine!

23:48.831 --> 23:51.165
I've always wanted a brother.

23:51.167 --> 23:53.534
Please don't try
to educate me on Tesla.

23:53.536 --> 23:58.641
Hello, Sam. Thank you for saving
me from that moron today.

23:59.709 --> 24:01.443
Oh, he's battery-operated.

24:01.445 --> 24:03.644
No, no, no.
Sam, Sam, he's alive.

24:03.646 --> 24:05.713
Sorry for what
happened with Tommy.

24:05.715 --> 24:08.849
I guess you could say
he got hosed.

24:11.321 --> 24:13.088
- That was you?
- Yep.

24:13.090 --> 24:17.692
And now that we're family,
we can be brothers!

24:17.694 --> 24:20.030
I think I'd make
a great Junk Brother.

24:21.598 --> 24:24.599
Right. Just a sec. Sidebar.

24:24.601 --> 24:25.901
Are we losing our minds?

24:25.903 --> 24:27.836
I don't think
we can at the same time.

24:27.838 --> 24:29.171
Okay, but just to clarify,

24:29.173 --> 24:30.906
we're talking
to a puppet right now.

24:30.908 --> 24:32.142
Yeah.

24:33.844 --> 24:35.447
Maybe he's alive.

24:37.681 --> 24:41.417
Of course I'm alive!
Heh-heh-heh.

24:41.419 --> 24:45.254
And I can make
all your problems go away.

24:45.256 --> 24:48.460
Didn't your sister tell you
to fold the laundry?

24:51.596 --> 24:54.931
There. Now you have time
to do your homework.

24:54.933 --> 24:58.234
Oh, what's that? You don't want
to do your homework?

24:58.236 --> 25:00.738
That's okay.
I just did it for you.

25:07.879 --> 25:09.712
You know algebra?

25:09.714 --> 25:11.614
A squared
plus B squared equals

25:11.616 --> 25:13.649
of course! Heh, heh.

25:13.651 --> 25:16.987
This is amazing.
It's all correct.

25:16.989 --> 25:18.956
So you can change
all of our grades.

25:18.958 --> 25:22.427
I can only change
the things right in front of me.

25:22.429 --> 25:26.031
But whatever I see,
I can bring to life.

25:27.467 --> 25:30.468
<i>Karru marri odonna loma</i>

25:30.470 --> 25:34.339
<i>molonu karrano.</i>

25:34.341 --> 25:36.773
<i>Round one. Fight!</i>

25:43.383 --> 25:45.049
That is awesome.

25:45.051 --> 25:48.887
I will never question
picking up junk again.

25:48.889 --> 25:51.055
Wait until Mom
and Sarah find out.

25:52.325 --> 25:54.125
Slow your roll there, kid.

25:54.127 --> 25:57.662
Let's just keep this
our little secret for now.

25:57.664 --> 26:01.766
Give me a chance
to win them over first.

26:06.007 --> 26:09.108
Ah, you're terrible at this.
Heh-heh-heh.

26:09.110 --> 26:11.143
I'm literally crushing you
right now.

26:11.145 --> 26:13.445
Can't believe you're losing
to a puppet.

26:13.447 --> 26:16.650
Right. And I'm not
even using my magical powers.

26:16.652 --> 26:17.818
Heh. Hm?

26:22.957 --> 26:24.723
Back so soon?

26:24.725 --> 26:26.560
- Don't ask.
- Are you okay?

26:26.562 --> 26:28.727
- What happened?
- What happened?

26:28.729 --> 26:31.830
Well, turns out the guy I liked
is a total scumbag.

26:31.832 --> 26:34.334
Mom expects me to run
this entire house by myself.

26:34.336 --> 26:36.670
And if I don't figure out
this essay by Friday,

26:36.672 --> 26:40.175
I'm never getting out of this
town. So no, I'm not okay.

26:44.313 --> 26:46.248
Why are you guys
acting so weird?

26:47.282 --> 26:48.516
- Us?
- Nothing.

26:48.518 --> 26:49.950
No reason at all. Mm-hm.

26:49.952 --> 26:51.619
I'm working
on my science project.

26:51.621 --> 26:53.787
- We're just playing video games.
- Just us two.

26:53.789 --> 26:56.122
- Nobody else.
- Mm-hm.

26:56.124 --> 26:58.024
I'm going to bed.

26:58.026 --> 26:59.362
Good night.

27:05.034 --> 27:06.502
Who just said that?

27:07.837 --> 27:09.303
- Me!
- Sam.

27:09.305 --> 27:10.706
Good night.

27:10.708 --> 27:12.473
It's a new thing we're doing.

27:12.475 --> 27:14.475
Good night.
Good night.

27:14.477 --> 27:16.377
- Hit the hay.
- Good night, Sarah.

27:16.379 --> 27:18.614
Night-night.

27:18.616 --> 27:20.848
That is not cool, Slappy.

28:30.822 --> 28:33.490
What the hell?

28:33.492 --> 28:37.161
- Ugh. God, they are such tools.
- Boo!

28:39.965 --> 28:42.667
Missed you at the show
last night.

28:42.669 --> 28:45.503
Bet you did. You have fun?

28:45.505 --> 28:47.672
It was okay.
A bunch of us just hanging out.

28:47.674 --> 28:49.173
Totally casual.

28:49.175 --> 28:50.677
Right.

28:52.679 --> 28:55.013
- What's with the dummy?
- Oh, him?

28:55.015 --> 28:57.282
We were just hanging out.

28:57.284 --> 28:59.286
Totally casual.

29:18.673 --> 29:19.841
Fly, little ghost.

29:25.012 --> 29:28.080
Hey, whoever that is, can you
toss me up some more string?

29:28.082 --> 29:29.517
Sure.

29:35.657 --> 29:38.224
Okay.

29:38.226 --> 29:41.026
That's hilarious.

29:41.028 --> 29:42.429
Sarah?

29:43.866 --> 29:46.932
Oh! Hey, hey, hey,
not funny, not funny.

29:46.934 --> 29:48.934
Sarah, stop fooling around.

29:48.936 --> 29:52.608
I'd say you're the one
fooling around.

29:54.042 --> 29:55.475
How are you talking?

29:55.477 --> 29:58.512
I love the theater.

29:58.514 --> 30:01.849
I always bring down the house.

30:05.187 --> 30:07.655
Wait, no! What are you doing?
What are you doing?

30:07.657 --> 30:09.256
Tell me, Tyler.

30:09.258 --> 30:12.060
What does it say
on that top step?

30:13.363 --> 30:16.197
Uh... It's not a step?

30:16.199 --> 30:18.031
Maybe you'll remember that

30:18.033 --> 30:22.305
the next time you
step out of line with my sister.

30:33.416 --> 30:35.784
It was a puppet, man.
It was a puppet.

30:35.786 --> 30:37.786
It had these
supernatural powers.

30:37.788 --> 30:39.822
He could move things
with his mind.

30:39.824 --> 30:41.290
I swear.

30:41.292 --> 30:43.592
She knows! Ask her.
It was in her locker.

30:43.594 --> 30:46.562
Please tell him real quick.
Sarah, tell him!

30:46.564 --> 30:48.764
It's just the meds
kicking in, sir.

30:48.766 --> 30:50.799
Last guy said he saw a dragon.

30:50.801 --> 30:52.801
It wasn't a dragon.
It was a puppet.

31:08.252 --> 31:11.053
Nikola Tesla
constructed this tower

31:11.055 --> 31:13.223
right here in Wardenclyffe,
New York

31:13.225 --> 31:15.925
to beam bolts of electricity
across the world.

31:15.927 --> 31:17.460
And today...

31:17.462 --> 31:20.730
we are going
to beam bolts of electricity

31:20.732 --> 31:22.665
across this classroom.

31:22.667 --> 31:25.635
Someone beam me
out of this classroom.

31:27.940 --> 31:30.373
May I have a volunteer?

31:30.375 --> 31:32.776
You, ma'am,
in the pink sweater.

31:32.778 --> 31:36.012
Hold that and prepare
to be amazed.

31:36.014 --> 31:37.815
Behold:

31:37.817 --> 31:40.253
The power of Tesla.

32:01.173 --> 32:03.677
Mr. Quinn, unplug that now!

32:18.058 --> 32:20.160
That was awesome!

32:22.062 --> 32:26.666
And that was my presentation
on Nikola Tesla.

32:26.668 --> 32:29.469
Any...? Any questions?

32:31.204 --> 32:33.271
Today's picture day!

32:38.546 --> 32:41.614
This is not good.
I'm so busted.

32:41.616 --> 32:43.583
Oh, great,
the fire department's here?

32:43.585 --> 32:46.087
They're definitely gonna
make you repeat a grade.

32:47.855 --> 32:50.690
Please tell me you guys
had nothing to do with this.

32:50.692 --> 32:53.125
Sonny blew up the science wing.
It was so cool.

32:53.127 --> 32:55.127
It was an accident.

32:55.129 --> 32:56.730
What are you doing here?

32:56.732 --> 32:59.198
Tyler Mitchell just got loaded
into an ambulance.

32:59.200 --> 33:01.401
He said the dummy
you guys put in my backpack

33:01.403 --> 33:04.905
attacked him
with supernatural powers.

33:04.907 --> 33:07.374
We didn't put Slappy
in your backpack.

33:09.044 --> 33:10.412
Get in.

33:12.448 --> 33:13.948
<i>You're telling me</i>

33:13.950 --> 33:17.250
that you discovered
a walking, talking dummy

33:17.252 --> 33:18.920
and you didn't tell me?

33:18.922 --> 33:21.089
He seemed like a nice guy
at the start.

33:21.091 --> 33:24.759
- He had great manners.
- He told us to keep it a secret.

33:24.761 --> 33:26.861
A, I'm your sister.

33:26.863 --> 33:28.529
And B, as a general rule,

33:28.531 --> 33:31.099
when an animated doll
tells you to keep secrets,

33:31.101 --> 33:32.333
that's a red flag.

33:32.335 --> 33:33.768
He's not just some doll.

33:33.770 --> 33:35.770
He's got powers.
He can move stuff with his mind.

33:35.772 --> 33:37.572
You guys, this is insane.

33:37.574 --> 33:40.475
I mean,
why would he go after Tyler?

33:40.477 --> 33:43.611
Maybe he heard you complaining
about him last night.

33:43.613 --> 33:45.482
Great.
What else did I complain about?

33:47.852 --> 33:49.118
Mom.

34:00.464 --> 34:03.799
Hey, kids, you wanna see
the mummies come to life?

34:03.801 --> 34:06.001
- Sorry, Mr. Chu!
- Don't have time to talk now!

34:06.003 --> 34:07.836
Your loss!

34:09.607 --> 34:11.239
- Mom!
- Ms. Quinn!

34:13.811 --> 34:19.248
Hey. You didn't tell me you got
a ventriloquist dummy. How fun!

34:19.250 --> 34:22.018
He was sitting at the table
like a little person.

34:22.020 --> 34:25.121
"Hi, kids. My name is Bobo.

34:25.123 --> 34:27.690
And I like listening to Mom."
Heh, heh.

34:27.693 --> 34:29.793
Mom, his name is Slappy,

34:29.795 --> 34:31.895
and I would not do that
if I were you.

34:31.897 --> 34:33.996
Slappy.
That's a ridiculous name.

34:33.998 --> 34:36.167
No, no. His name is Bobo.

34:36.168 --> 34:39.302
- Mom, you don't understand.
- Ms. Quinn, he's alive.

34:39.304 --> 34:41.404
I think these guys
are trying to play

34:41.406 --> 34:43.572
some sort of
a Halloween prank on us,

34:43.574 --> 34:45.574
but I'm not buying it.
Are you? No.

34:47.179 --> 34:50.380
Oh, let me get that.
But nice try. Very creative.

34:50.382 --> 34:53.385
Stay right there.
Don't go anywhere.

35:00.760 --> 35:04.196
Hi, kids. Good day at school?

35:04.198 --> 35:06.897
Oh, my God. He sounds
even creepier than he looks.

35:06.899 --> 35:10.035
Ha-ha-ha. We're gonna be
such a happy family.

35:10.037 --> 35:11.702
You're not our family.

35:11.704 --> 35:14.206
Do it, Sonny. Turn him off.

35:14.208 --> 35:17.843
Hearing you say that
makes me mad.

35:17.845 --> 35:23.181
<i>"Karru marri odonna
loma molonu karrano."</i>

35:23.183 --> 35:24.850
Don't do that.

35:24.852 --> 35:26.485
Do it again.

35:26.487 --> 35:29.521
<i>"Karru marri odonna
loma molonu karrano."</i>

35:40.969 --> 35:42.137
It worked.

35:53.648 --> 35:55.047
And trust me.

35:55.049 --> 35:57.884
You don't want to find out
what happens...

35:57.886 --> 36:00.922
when I get mad.

36:01.956 --> 36:03.823
- Okay.
- Hm?

36:03.825 --> 36:07.060
Well, that was
an interesting phone call.

36:07.062 --> 36:08.694
Anything you wanna tell me?

36:08.696 --> 36:11.064
Yes, we've been trying to.
That dummy is evil.

36:11.066 --> 36:13.533
You blew up the science lab?

36:13.535 --> 36:15.301
Yeah, there was that too.

36:15.303 --> 36:17.704
Do you know
how much damage you've caused?

36:17.706 --> 36:18.972
It wasn't Sonny's fault.

36:18.974 --> 36:20.874
I'm sure it was an accident.

36:20.876 --> 36:23.977
- It wasn't an accident. The dummy did it.
- Yeah.

36:23.979 --> 36:26.713
Do I look like a dummy
to you?

36:26.715 --> 36:28.315
We're telling
the truth!

36:28.317 --> 36:29.750
Here's some truth for you.

36:29.752 --> 36:31.819
Halloween is canceled
for the three of you.

36:31.821 --> 36:33.453
- What?
- Canceled.

36:33.455 --> 36:35.789
- Come on.
- You know...

36:35.791 --> 36:39.593
I expect this kind of
craziness from the boys.

36:39.595 --> 36:41.495
But I felt like
you were gonna help me

36:41.497 --> 36:43.198
keep things under control,
Sarah.

36:43.200 --> 36:44.632
Mom.

36:44.634 --> 36:46.466
I'm disappointed.

36:46.468 --> 36:48.203
- Come on. Mom.
- Mom, please.

36:51.340 --> 36:54.077
Not as disappointed
as I am.

36:55.111 --> 36:57.380
My room.
Now.

37:02.153 --> 37:03.685
We've got a problem.

37:03.687 --> 37:06.155
Yeah. I have never seen
your mom that mad.

37:06.157 --> 37:08.523
I'm talking about
the psycho dummy on our couch.

37:08.525 --> 37:12.261
Did somebody call
a family meeting without me?

37:12.263 --> 37:14.462
No, no. Slappy,
why would you think that?

37:14.464 --> 37:18.033
We were just planning
a surprise party for you.

37:18.035 --> 37:21.470
Well, I've got a surprise
for the three of you.

37:21.472 --> 37:23.873
This is my house now.

37:23.875 --> 37:25.875
And under my roof,

37:25.877 --> 37:27.676
I make the rules.

37:27.678 --> 37:30.779
Sorry, but you just got voted
out of this family.

37:30.781 --> 37:32.884
- Huh? Aah!
- Oh!

37:37.990 --> 37:40.389
What do we do with him now?

37:40.391 --> 37:41.658
Fireplace.

37:41.660 --> 37:43.159
No. No way.

37:43.161 --> 37:45.328
I would have nightmares
the rest of my life.

37:45.330 --> 37:48.565
No. I have a better idea.

37:50.569 --> 37:53.870
Ugh. We've
been walking forever.

37:53.872 --> 37:56.740
It's like this whole place
is made of poison ivy.

37:56.742 --> 37:58.708
Stop complaining.

37:58.710 --> 38:00.280
How much farther is it?

38:00.947 --> 38:02.213
Here.

38:02.215 --> 38:04.750
This should work.

38:07.220 --> 38:10.187
Am I the only one that feels
like we're committing a crime?

38:10.189 --> 38:13.559
It's a dummy. The only crime
we're committing is littering.

38:14.494 --> 38:17.061
- Ready?
- Yeah, yeah.

38:17.063 --> 38:19.098
Okay, watch out.

38:31.345 --> 38:33.080
It's done.

38:34.748 --> 38:36.317
Let's get out of here.

38:41.121 --> 38:42.423
Sonny, come on.

38:55.602 --> 38:57.136
We just killed a puppet.

38:57.138 --> 38:59.272
Trust me, we had to.

38:59.274 --> 39:01.341
And I say we just
forget it ever happened,

39:01.343 --> 39:03.176
because no one
will believe us anyway.

39:03.178 --> 39:04.444
It's over.

39:04.446 --> 39:06.112
He's locked in a suitcase.

39:06.114 --> 39:08.681
There's no way
that dummy's getting out.

39:12.921 --> 39:15.555
Who you calling "dummy,"
dummy?

39:20.396 --> 39:21.761
What do you want from us?

39:21.763 --> 39:24.564
I just want to be
part of the family.

39:24.566 --> 39:26.701
He's gonna break
through the windshield.

39:38.948 --> 39:40.180
Is everyone okay?

39:40.182 --> 39:41.650
Yeah.
Think so.

39:43.285 --> 39:46.153
Where's Slappy?

39:46.155 --> 39:49.393
Guys, I think we just made
things a thousand times worse.

40:10.814 --> 40:13.148
Trick or treat!

40:13.150 --> 40:14.983
There you go, Hank.

40:14.985 --> 40:17.552
All right,
come on in. Zoink!

40:17.554 --> 40:19.455
Step right up.
Don't be scared.

40:19.457 --> 40:22.158
Welcome to my haunted house.

40:22.160 --> 40:23.591
Boo!

40:23.593 --> 40:26.228
All right.
Here you go. Happy Halloween.

40:28.966 --> 40:31.867
Hey, what's up, my witches?

40:31.869 --> 40:33.536
Little Frankenstein humor.

40:33.538 --> 40:34.804
Zoink!

40:34.806 --> 40:36.072
Beat it.

40:38.643 --> 40:40.042
Here you go.

40:40.044 --> 40:41.310
Bye-bye!

40:41.312 --> 40:43.313
Hey, my princess.

40:43.315 --> 40:44.548
Bye-bye!

40:44.550 --> 40:46.383
Hey, my cowboy.

40:46.385 --> 40:49.154
- I'm not a cowboy!
- Yes, you are. Bye-bye!

40:50.621 --> 40:52.888
"A mysterious disturbance

- What book?

In that abandoned house, we
found this old locked-up book.

that's when Slappy appeared.

41:25.425 --> 41:27.425
Yeah, but Tommy Madigan
took it from us.

41:27.427 --> 41:30.595
Well, how do you know the book
was written by R.L. Stine?

- For Stine?

get in touch with R.L. Stine.</i>

46:00.510 --> 46:02.075
<i>This is gonna sound crazy,</i>

46:02.077 --> 46:04.779
<i>but I think one of his stories
has come to life.</i>

46:06.048 --> 46:07.848
<i>Hi, Mr. Shivers...</i>

46:07.850 --> 46:09.917
Well...

46:09.919 --> 46:12.219
Looks like we're on our own.

46:12.221 --> 46:14.021
Wait,
where are we going?

46:14.023 --> 46:17.191
To find Tommy Madigan
and get that book.

46:17.193 --> 46:18.426
Get that one.

46:18.428 --> 46:20.294
No way he's gonna
be able to get that.

46:20.296 --> 46:21.563
Oh.

46:21.565 --> 46:23.799
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Hey.

46:23.801 --> 46:25.299
Tommy! Tommy!

46:25.301 --> 46:26.902
What do these idiots want?

46:26.904 --> 46:28.169
I'll take care
of this.

46:28.171 --> 46:29.671
We need that book.

46:29.673 --> 46:31.740
- It's really important.
- It's super important.

46:31.742 --> 46:33.241
The book with
the lock on it.

46:33.243 --> 46:34.509
Okay, okay.
What book?

46:34.511 --> 46:36.111
The one you stole
from us, Tommy.

46:36.113 --> 46:37.846
Oh, yeah.
I've got it right here.

46:37.848 --> 46:39.781
- Oh, really?
- No, idiot.

46:39.783 --> 46:43.118
Why would I be carrying a book
around with me on Halloween?

46:43.120 --> 46:45.688
Now, go back home
with your babysitter.

46:45.690 --> 46:47.122
I'll be there in a bit
to egg your house.

46:47.124 --> 46:48.558
Listen,
you little punk,

46:48.560 --> 46:50.693
I'm not the babysitter.
I'm Sonny's sister.

46:50.695 --> 46:52.027
You're gonna give us
that book back

46:52.029 --> 46:53.863
or I'll make your life
a living hell.

46:53.865 --> 46:56.799
The only thing you'll use that
toilet paper for is to wipe...

46:56.801 --> 46:59.235
Okay. God, you don't have
to be so mean about it.

46:59.237 --> 47:01.137
Let's get
out of here.

47:01.139 --> 47:03.508
Book's at my house
in my room.

47:05.443 --> 47:09.780
But it's hidden, so good luck
finding it, losers. Heh, heh.

47:25.798 --> 47:28.298
Those are some
awesome costumes.

47:37.811 --> 47:39.044
Is this actually
happening?

47:43.249 --> 47:44.784
Guys, we gotta find
that book!

47:50.289 --> 47:53.023
Evening, Mr. Tesla.

47:53.025 --> 47:57.128
You don't mind if we bring
your tower back to life, do you?

48:02.536 --> 48:04.335
What did he say?

48:04.337 --> 48:06.805
Shut up.

48:06.807 --> 48:09.975
Tesla used this tower
to project electricity,

48:09.977 --> 48:12.176
but I'm going
to use this tower

48:12.178 --> 48:16.381
to project my magic
in ways he never imagined.

48:16.383 --> 48:20.686
It takes a genius
to know a genius.

48:22.590 --> 48:24.890
- Whoa.
- Heh-heh-heh.

48:24.892 --> 48:26.492
Come along,
Walter.

48:26.494 --> 48:27.893
We've got work
to do.

48:27.895 --> 48:29.363
Very well.
Let's go.

48:32.767 --> 48:34.233
This is Tommy's house.

48:34.235 --> 48:37.271
Well, I guess
we just knock?

48:39.574 --> 48:41.708
Knock loud. He
lives with his grandma.

48:43.879 --> 48:45.512
Okay.

48:46.982 --> 48:49.214
Wait! Guys,
there she is.

48:49.216 --> 48:50.584
She's asleep.

48:50.586 --> 48:52.519
I guess we'll just
have to wake her up.

48:52.521 --> 48:54.387
- Hello! Come on.
- Hello!

48:54.389 --> 48:56.756
- Hello!
- Tommy's grandma!

48:56.758 --> 48:59.092
Wow.

48:59.094 --> 49:00.862
Guess she's a deep sleeper.

49:03.565 --> 49:05.066
It's locked.

49:05.068 --> 49:07.233
Find another way in
and go get that book.

49:07.235 --> 49:08.403
What are you gonna do?

49:11.106 --> 49:13.708
I'm gonna make sure
nothing surprises us. Go!

49:29.225 --> 49:30.959
- Ow!
- Shh.

49:30.961 --> 49:33.895
What?

49:33.897 --> 49:37.567
I can't believe we're
breaking into someone's house right now.

49:45.709 --> 49:48.245
Shh.

49:50.948 --> 49:52.881
Hey, they got gummy bears.

49:52.883 --> 49:54.685
Who cares?
Stop screwing around.

49:56.121 --> 49:57.452
<i>Hands off!</i>

50:02.060 --> 50:04.393
Sam, stop
screwing around. Let's go.

50:04.395 --> 50:06.031
Okay, all right.

50:09.868 --> 50:11.736
<i>Watch this, Walter.</i>

50:13.872 --> 50:15.538
Whoa. Whoa.

50:17.842 --> 50:22.311
Why settle for
a small family, Walter,

50:22.313 --> 50:25.782
when we can project
my power everywhere

50:25.784 --> 50:28.986
and bring all of
Halloween to life?

50:28.988 --> 50:31.220
Yeah.

50:31.222 --> 50:34.825
<i>Karru marri odonna loma</i>

50:34.827 --> 50:38.294
- <i>molonu karrano.</i>
- Whoa.

50:38.296 --> 50:40.196
<i>Karru marri</i>

50:40.198 --> 50:45.035
<i>odonna loma
molonu karrano.</i>

51:22.043 --> 51:25.343
Hyah! Ha-ha-ha!

51:28.248 --> 51:31.483
- Sam, I found it. Yeah.
- You found it?

51:31.485 --> 51:32.952
"R.L. Stine."

51:32.954 --> 51:34.822
How did we miss that?

51:36.724 --> 51:39.859
- That can't be good.
- Yeah. We gotta go.

51:47.668 --> 51:49.335
Let's just go
back out the window.

51:49.337 --> 51:50.605
All right.

51:52.707 --> 51:54.673
- Oh.
- Ah!

51:57.212 --> 51:58.577
Sam!

51:58.579 --> 52:00.579
The hand
has my hand!

52:00.581 --> 52:02.582
Just rip it off!
Throw it!

52:08.023 --> 52:10.425
Sam. Turn around.

52:11.894 --> 52:13.028
They're moving.

52:14.463 --> 52:16.063
Sonny,
they're just gummy bears.

52:16.065 --> 52:18.166
They're so tiny and cute.
What can they do?

52:22.771 --> 52:24.105
Hey there, little guys.

52:24.107 --> 52:25.907
Sam, you just ate
half their family.

52:25.909 --> 52:27.543
I would not do that
if I were you.

52:40.690 --> 52:42.757
Why are they walking
towards us?

52:42.759 --> 52:45.426
Okay. All right.
Maybe

52:45.428 --> 52:48.830
they just want us
to stay and play.

53:01.178 --> 53:03.011
God, where is everyone?

53:03.013 --> 53:05.113
Oh, there's one
on my back, Sam!

53:05.115 --> 53:06.815
Okay, okay!

53:09.954 --> 53:12.821
- Pull harder!
- I'm trying!

53:12.823 --> 53:14.389
- Whoa.
- Ha-ha-ha!

53:14.391 --> 53:15.791
Go for the window, Sam!

53:15.793 --> 53:17.062
I'm coming!

53:18.864 --> 53:20.031
Whoa!

53:36.248 --> 53:39.584
Just! Stop! Giggling!

53:48.460 --> 53:50.393
Sam! I need some help
over here...

53:50.395 --> 53:53.463
Sonny!

53:58.470 --> 53:59.803
Mom, we're under attack!

53:59.805 --> 54:01.572
Sonny, what are you
talking about?

54:01.574 --> 54:03.209
Where's Sarah?
Who's attacking you?

54:05.077 --> 54:06.710
Gummy bears.

54:06.712 --> 54:08.679
<i>What? Honey, you're mumbling.</i>

54:08.681 --> 54:09.914
<i>Put Sarah on the phone.</i>

54:11.417 --> 54:13.084
<i>- Sonny.</i>
- Whee!

54:15.055 --> 54:16.288
<i>What...?</i>

54:16.290 --> 54:17.956
Okay, that's it.

54:17.958 --> 54:20.624
Do not leave the house!
I'm coming home.

54:37.245 --> 54:39.245
Sonny, help!

54:39.247 --> 54:40.612
Sam, I'm coming!

54:40.614 --> 54:42.283
Hurry!

55:05.106 --> 55:09.742
No, no, no!
You'll never take me alive!

55:13.248 --> 55:15.949
That is my new favorite book.

55:15.951 --> 55:18.651
- You okay?
- I think.

55:18.653 --> 55:20.519
Let's get out of here.

55:21.924 --> 55:23.523
What are you guys
doing in there?

55:23.525 --> 55:25.792
Oh, no big deal, really.
Just being mauled

55:25.794 --> 55:27.294
by my favorite
comfort food!

55:27.296 --> 55:28.795
Wait. Just stop.
Stop, stop!

55:28.797 --> 55:30.797
What are you guys
even talking about?

55:30.799 --> 55:32.833
Everything is alive, Sarah.
Even candy.

55:32.835 --> 55:35.169
Well, is that the book?
Let's read it.

55:35.171 --> 55:37.671
There's something you need
to know about this book.

55:37.673 --> 55:39.040
What?

55:40.642 --> 55:41.943
Look out!

55:45.714 --> 55:47.817
Whoa!

56:03.467 --> 56:05.867
That's what.

56:05.869 --> 56:07.869
This is not
a normal book, Sarah.

56:16.347 --> 56:17.880
Who would write this?

56:40.338 --> 56:42.140
Oh, what is this?

56:43.075 --> 56:44.707
Okay.

56:44.709 --> 56:45.877
- Huh?
- Oh!

56:47.946 --> 56:50.548
- Hyah!
- Oh, you rehearsed that, did you?

56:50.550 --> 56:54.186
Best costume of the night, sir.

57:13.573 --> 57:15.074
Go!

57:23.417 --> 57:25.249
Look out, look out! Ah!

57:27.887 --> 57:29.287
What's going on?

57:29.289 --> 57:32.025
There! Let's take
the alley. It's empty.

57:35.996 --> 57:37.661
Wait, wait!

57:37.663 --> 57:40.298
We need to read the book
and see how we can end this.

57:40.300 --> 57:42.968
Let me see.

57:42.970 --> 57:45.670
"It was nearly Halloween
in the town of Wardenclyffe..."

57:45.672 --> 57:47.839
Blah, blah, blah. Here!

57:47.841 --> 57:49.575
"His revenge
was to create a family

57:49.577 --> 57:52.277
by bringing Halloween to life,
but that wasn't enough."

57:52.279 --> 57:54.247
That seems like
plenty of revenge to me.

57:54.249 --> 57:57.684
"Because he wanted more than
a family. He wanted a mother.

58:00.388 --> 58:02.490
His plan was to..."

58:03.724 --> 58:05.324
Was to what?
Keep reading.

58:05.326 --> 58:06.959
I-I-I can't.

58:06.961 --> 58:11.564
That was the last page.
It's an unfinished manuscript.

58:11.566 --> 58:13.334
What?

58:14.637 --> 58:16.037
Okay, great.
What do we do now?

58:17.272 --> 58:19.138
Slappy's gonna go after Mom.

58:19.140 --> 58:22.409
That book is the only thing
we have to stop him.

58:22.411 --> 58:24.744
We have to go to
the nursing home and save her.

58:24.746 --> 58:26.679
Mom's not at
the nursing home.

58:26.681 --> 58:28.781
Where is she?

58:28.783 --> 58:31.985
- On her way home to save us.
- What?

58:31.987 --> 58:34.388
She called while we were
attacked by gummy bears.

58:34.390 --> 58:36.156
Why answer
at a time like that?

58:36.158 --> 58:39.293
Maybe because unlike you, Sarah,
I pick up Mom's phone calls.

58:39.295 --> 58:40.694
Really? Guilt trip much?

58:40.696 --> 58:42.863
We need to find your mom
before Slappy does.

58:42.865 --> 58:44.566
Now, come on,
let's go!

58:48.572 --> 58:51.673
Your woodworking skills
are impressive.

58:51.675 --> 58:52.906
Yes.

58:52.908 --> 58:55.075
This will do nicely.

58:55.077 --> 58:57.945
Oh, I used to manage
a hardware store.

58:57.947 --> 59:00.881
- Walter. Focus, please.
- Yes.

59:00.883 --> 59:06.187
Now tell my monsters to get me
Mama and get me that book.

59:06.189 --> 59:08.723
Yeah. Yes.

59:08.725 --> 59:10.661
Run!

59:13.964 --> 59:15.396
Duck!

59:15.398 --> 59:16.833
Look out!

59:23.341 --> 59:24.508
What the...?

59:26.244 --> 59:27.545
That's Mr. Peters!

59:30.881 --> 59:33.349
- Nice doggy.
- It's right behind you!

59:33.351 --> 59:35.117
Ah! Not on my leg!

59:35.119 --> 59:38.354
Help!

59:38.356 --> 59:41.257
That's Mom! That's Mom!
Come on!

59:41.259 --> 59:43.092
You bunch of scallywags!

59:43.094 --> 59:44.760
Kids, watch out!

59:47.798 --> 59:48.966
Behind you!

59:57.376 --> 59:59.442
Okay, now's our chance.

59:59.444 --> 01:00:01.411
Give me the book.
I'm gonna protect Mom.

01:00:01.413 --> 01:00:03.713
You get the ladder
and meet me at that tree.

01:00:03.715 --> 01:00:05.584
- Wait till it's safe, then go.
- Okay.

01:00:18.564 --> 01:00:20.333
Okay, okay.

01:00:27.774 --> 01:00:31.909
Oh, my God! We're all gonna die!
Run for your life! Ah!

01:00:31.911 --> 01:00:33.844
Oh, my God.

01:00:33.846 --> 01:00:35.946
Oops. Not a monster.

01:00:35.948 --> 01:00:37.348
All right, let's go!

01:00:37.350 --> 01:00:38.849
Come on!

01:00:38.851 --> 01:00:40.351
Halt!

01:00:40.353 --> 01:00:43.087
My orders are
to guard this porch!

01:00:43.089 --> 01:00:44.323
No way.

01:00:44.325 --> 01:00:45.956
You like carving pumpkins,
huh?

01:00:45.958 --> 01:00:47.958
Look what you did
to poor Terry.

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:50.128
Hiya! I'm round.

01:00:50.130 --> 01:00:52.299
Sergeant Squash,
open fire.

01:00:54.468 --> 01:00:56.168
Oh. Ow!

01:01:04.178 --> 01:01:05.844
We need to find
another way in!

01:01:05.846 --> 01:01:07.814
No. This is my house.

01:01:07.816 --> 01:01:09.784
I'm hit! Medic!

01:01:11.085 --> 01:01:12.652
What are you doing?
Put me down!

01:01:12.654 --> 01:01:14.287
Hiya! Happy Easter.

01:01:14.289 --> 01:01:15.688
- No, no!
- Ugh!

01:01:15.690 --> 01:01:18.157
Yes! Let's go.

01:01:18.159 --> 01:01:21.127
Sarah, I was so worried.
Are you okay?

01:01:21.129 --> 01:01:22.495
I'm fine.
Just hang tight.

01:01:22.497 --> 01:01:24.464
I'm gonna get you down.
I promise.

01:01:24.466 --> 01:01:25.965
I just need you to trust me.

01:01:25.967 --> 01:01:28.134
Don't worry about me. Run. Hide!

01:01:28.136 --> 01:01:29.971
Ghost at 11 o'clock!

01:01:32.207 --> 01:01:35.210
No, no, no! Get back here!

01:01:41.350 --> 01:01:43.817
That's my book! Ah!

01:01:43.819 --> 01:01:45.221
We gotta go.

01:01:50.393 --> 01:01:53.327
Sarah!
Sarah, let go of that ghost!

01:01:53.329 --> 01:01:55.864
Do not let go
of that ghost!

01:01:59.836 --> 01:02:02.336
- You okay?
- No, that ghost took the book.

01:02:05.842 --> 01:02:08.308
- Mom!
- Oh, kids. Help!

01:02:08.310 --> 01:02:09.878
No, no, no!

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:11.979
- Sarah!
- Mom!

01:02:15.318 --> 01:02:17.685
It's heading for the Tesla lab.

01:02:17.687 --> 01:02:19.320
Slappy brought
the tower to life.

01:02:19.322 --> 01:02:20.722
That's why
this is happening.

01:02:20.724 --> 01:02:22.025
We have to stop him.

01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:25.895
Uh, guys?

01:02:28.666 --> 01:02:30.833
Sonny, what do we do?

01:02:30.835 --> 01:02:32.436
I don't know.
You're the older one.

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:38.609
No, no, no.
It's me, Mr. Chu!

01:02:39.644 --> 01:02:41.142
Mr. Chu?

01:02:41.144 --> 01:02:44.979
Shh! Follow me!
To the basement now!

01:02:44.981 --> 01:02:46.715
Don't ruin the Mylar.

01:02:46.717 --> 01:02:49.253
I'm saving it for next year.
Go, go, go.

01:02:56.561 --> 01:02:58.160
Let me get this straight.

01:02:58.162 --> 01:03:01.665
We are living a <i>Goosebumps</i>
story right now?

01:03:01.667 --> 01:03:03.332
Okay, clearly you're a fan.

01:03:03.334 --> 01:03:05.469
This is the greatest thing
I've ever heard!

01:03:05.471 --> 01:03:08.371
Hold on. Let me guess, let me
guess, let me guess. Um...

01:03:08.373 --> 01:03:09.906
<i>Monster Blood.</i>

01:03:09.908 --> 01:03:12.876
No, too on the nose.
Yeah, you're right. Um...

01:03:12.878 --> 01:03:15.779
<i>The Scarecrow Walks
at Midnight.</i>

01:03:15.781 --> 01:03:17.981
No. <i>Haunted Halloween.</i>

01:03:17.983 --> 01:03:21.218
I don't know that one.
How does it end?

01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:23.053
That's the problem.

01:03:23.055 --> 01:03:24.554
It doesn't.

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:34.966
Mm! Mm!

01:03:34.968 --> 01:03:36.567
Hello, Mama.

01:03:36.569 --> 01:03:38.336
Remember me?

01:03:38.338 --> 01:03:40.505
You put me on your lap.

01:03:40.507 --> 01:03:42.874
Put those cute words
in my mouth.

01:03:42.876 --> 01:03:46.644
What was it you called me?
"Bobo"? Ha-ha-ha.

01:03:46.646 --> 01:03:48.679
Can't talk?

01:03:48.681 --> 01:03:50.615
Don't you worry.

01:03:50.617 --> 01:03:54.552
From now on, I'll do
the talking for both of us.

01:03:56.724 --> 01:04:00.026
I'm gonna make you
so proud, Mama.

01:04:01.862 --> 01:04:04.663
<i>Onarrak unolom</i>

01:04:04.665 --> 01:04:06.465
<i>amol</i>

01:04:06.467 --> 01:04:08.467
<i>annodo irram</i>

01:04:08.469 --> 01:04:10.101
<i>urrak.</i>

01:04:12.206 --> 01:04:14.172
It's working.

01:04:14.174 --> 01:04:15.643
Yes.

01:04:22.216 --> 01:04:25.150
My mind is literally
blown right now.

01:04:25.152 --> 01:04:28.353
I mean, we get to finish
our <i>Goosebumps</i> story!

01:04:28.355 --> 01:04:30.723
This isn't a creative-writing
exercise, Mr. Chu.

01:04:30.725 --> 01:04:32.525
Slappy has our mom!

01:04:32.527 --> 01:04:35.562
Yeah, and then you get to
save your mom. It's Chapter 22:

01:04:35.564 --> 01:04:38.631
"The kids save their mom
from the demonic dummy."

01:04:38.633 --> 01:04:40.934
Well, the only thing
I had to save my mom

01:04:40.936 --> 01:04:43.736
was that book,
and I lost it. So...

01:04:43.738 --> 01:04:46.272
Sarah. This is not
your fault.

01:04:46.274 --> 01:04:48.074
If anything, it's my fault.

01:04:48.076 --> 01:04:50.945
I'm the one who found the book
and brought Slappy to life.

01:04:50.947 --> 01:04:52.680
And I even told Slappy
about Tesla.

01:04:52.682 --> 01:04:54.615
Mom trusted me to
take care of you guys,

01:04:54.617 --> 01:04:56.584
and I told her
I would save her.

01:04:56.586 --> 01:04:58.386
I failed.

01:04:59.922 --> 01:05:01.789
I know I always say that
I can't wait

01:05:01.791 --> 01:05:04.592
to go to college
and get started on my real life,

01:05:04.594 --> 01:05:06.896
but you guys are my life.

01:05:09.098 --> 01:05:11.332
This is a classic
<i>Goosebumps</i> moment.

01:05:11.334 --> 01:05:13.167
Do you remember
<i>Say Cheese and Die...?</i>

01:05:13.169 --> 01:05:15.169
- This is real life, Chu!
- Okay.

01:05:15.171 --> 01:05:18.873
Guys, Slappy is using the Tesla
Tower to power Halloween.

01:05:18.875 --> 01:05:20.541
If I can get in there,
maybe I can

01:05:20.543 --> 01:05:22.176
shut it off,
and we can save Mom.

01:05:22.178 --> 01:05:23.845
But there's
monsters everywhere.

01:05:23.847 --> 01:05:25.379
How are we gonna
get past them?

01:05:25.381 --> 01:05:26.881
Easy.

01:05:26.883 --> 01:05:28.349
Camouflage.

01:05:31.253 --> 01:05:33.090
Welcome to my crafts lab.

01:05:34.358 --> 01:05:36.224
Wow.

01:06:26.645 --> 01:06:28.279
Jeez,
they're still everywhere.

01:06:30.683 --> 01:06:32.484
It's actually working.

01:06:33.952 --> 01:06:35.952
Come on. We gotta
get to that tower.

01:06:41.527 --> 01:06:43.527
I can't believe
we're really here.

01:06:43.529 --> 01:06:45.228
I can barely see
out of this thing.

01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:46.964
Is it cool?
Is it awesome?

01:06:46.966 --> 01:06:49.466
Hey, fanboy. Let's focus.

01:06:49.468 --> 01:06:50.770
Right. Sorry.

01:06:52.806 --> 01:06:54.774
Let's go.

01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:15.696
Don't. Move.

01:07:24.304 --> 01:07:26.006
Come on, let's go.
Come on!

01:07:38.086 --> 01:07:39.518
Look at this place.

01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:41.720
It's so creepy.

01:07:41.722 --> 01:07:43.290
Stay close.

01:07:50.532 --> 01:07:52.866
No wonder Tesla
abandoned this place.

01:07:52.868 --> 01:07:59.539
Shh, shh, shh.
Do you hear that?

01:08:08.985 --> 01:08:10.418
Come on.

01:08:36.145 --> 01:08:37.444
Oh, no.

01:08:37.446 --> 01:08:41.216
Not <i>Haunted Halloween.</i>

01:08:45.923 --> 01:08:48.892
Oh, my writing was
so cliché back then.

01:08:52.830 --> 01:08:56.665
I knew it! I knew I came up
with that first.

01:08:58.969 --> 01:09:02.470
That clever little dummy's
writing his own ending.

01:09:02.471 --> 01:09:04.339
Not in my book,
he's not.

01:09:06.609 --> 01:09:08.313
Oh, gnomes.

01:09:09.814 --> 01:09:11.279
Don't you dare.

01:09:11.282 --> 01:09:12.514
Stay.

01:09:12.515 --> 01:09:15.019
Ow! Son of a... Ah!

01:09:18.288 --> 01:09:20.555
Oh, witches!

01:09:20.558 --> 01:09:22.959
Get away, witches!

01:09:27.532 --> 01:09:30.702
- Guys, do you hear that?
- Shh!

01:09:34.206 --> 01:09:35.470
Wow.

01:09:35.473 --> 01:09:38.042
Whoa.

01:09:41.613 --> 01:09:43.346
Welcome.

01:09:43.349 --> 01:09:45.484
Slappy.

01:09:50.522 --> 01:09:52.421
Walter?

01:09:52.424 --> 01:09:54.125
Where's my mother?

01:09:54.127 --> 01:09:57.230
Don't you mean our mother?

01:10:01.935 --> 01:10:04.869
There's my sweet little babies.

01:10:04.871 --> 01:10:08.172
I just love a family reunion.

01:10:08.174 --> 01:10:11.408
- Mom.
- What did you do?

01:10:13.513 --> 01:10:15.513
I had a papa once!

01:10:15.515 --> 01:10:17.448
He let me down.

01:10:17.450 --> 01:10:20.352
But a mother's love
is forever.

01:10:20.354 --> 01:10:22.154
Turn her back now,
you psycho!

01:10:22.156 --> 01:10:23.888
Oh, should I?

01:10:23.890 --> 01:10:28.493
Unfortunately,
I have other plans.

01:10:28.495 --> 01:10:30.528
Walter!
The book, please.

01:10:30.530 --> 01:10:31.698
Yes.

01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:35.234
This book.

01:10:35.236 --> 01:10:37.202
Go prepare the tower!

01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:41.540
I'm going to do what
Stine couldn't:

01:10:41.542 --> 01:10:44.843
Finish this book,
once and for all.

01:10:50.551 --> 01:10:53.320
Spoiler alert:

01:10:53.322 --> 01:10:56.089
The manuscript gets destroyed
in that tower,

01:10:56.091 --> 01:10:59.591
and my Halloween family
lasts forever!

01:10:59.593 --> 01:11:02.796
Mama,
babysit the children for me.

01:11:02.798 --> 01:11:04.596
Yes, dear.

01:11:04.598 --> 01:11:06.766
We can't let him
destroy that book.

01:11:06.768 --> 01:11:10.539
Sonny, turn this thing off.
I'm going after Slappy.

01:11:13.141 --> 01:11:15.241
Just you and me now,
Slappy.

01:11:15.243 --> 01:11:20.281
Can't hear you. I'm too far
ahead of you. Hee-hee-hee!

01:11:20.283 --> 01:11:23.150
This is amperage
and this is voltage?

01:11:23.152 --> 01:11:24.986
None of these cables
make any sense.

01:11:24.988 --> 01:11:26.887
What about here?
Start pulling levers.

01:11:26.889 --> 01:11:29.256
- No, no, Sam, don't!
- Ah!

01:11:29.258 --> 01:11:31.626
Slappy booby-trapped
all this stuff.

01:11:42.672 --> 01:11:46.509
Careful, Sarah. It'd be a shame
to fall from that height.

01:11:54.418 --> 01:11:56.517
Plenty more
where that came from.

01:11:58.521 --> 01:12:00.858
Come on, Sonny,
turn this thing off.

01:12:02.693 --> 01:12:05.193
Oh, no. Sonny hurry up.

01:12:05.195 --> 01:12:06.928
Slappy's at the top.
Do something.

01:12:06.930 --> 01:12:08.330
I can't do it, Sam.

01:12:08.332 --> 01:12:10.832
Come on, Sonny.
You are the smartest kid I know.

01:12:10.834 --> 01:12:13.369
Sam, I couldn't even do
my little science project.

01:12:13.371 --> 01:12:14.636
Slappy did that.

01:12:14.638 --> 01:12:16.073
And even that one shorted out.

01:12:19.144 --> 01:12:21.543
Wait. That's it.

01:12:21.545 --> 01:12:25.348
We turn it up. All the way up.
We blow the fuse.

01:12:25.350 --> 01:12:27.116
- Yes!
- The fuse is over there.

01:12:32.457 --> 01:12:37.627
And now to finish this story
and destroy the town.

01:12:40.198 --> 01:12:41.367
No!

01:12:43.202 --> 01:12:45.668
What do you think
you're doing?

01:12:45.670 --> 01:12:47.337
Writing my own ending.

01:12:47.339 --> 01:12:48.838
Spoiler alert:
I save the town

01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:50.409
and put you back
where you belong.

01:12:55.014 --> 01:12:56.712
What's the matter?

01:12:56.714 --> 01:12:58.849
Writer's block?

01:12:58.851 --> 01:13:00.284
Again?

01:13:00.286 --> 01:13:01.919
- Grab that lever. Yes.
- This one?

01:13:01.921 --> 01:13:04.254
On my count,
we push up at the same time.

01:13:04.256 --> 01:13:05.925
Ready? Go!

01:13:17.437 --> 01:13:18.869
Give me the book.

01:13:22.075 --> 01:13:24.375
You're not gonna
get this book, Slappy.

01:13:24.377 --> 01:13:27.412
I have a friend
who might think otherwise.

01:13:37.525 --> 01:13:40.060
Nowhere else to run, sis!

01:13:44.298 --> 01:13:47.832
Fine. You win, Slappy.

01:13:47.834 --> 01:13:50.702
I'll give you the book,
but you gotta turn my mom back.

01:13:50.704 --> 01:13:52.240
Deal.

01:13:57.545 --> 01:14:00.846
It all ends
Slappily ever after.

01:14:02.416 --> 01:14:05.117
You forgot one thing:

01:14:05.119 --> 01:14:07.019
Never judge a book
by its cover.

01:14:07.021 --> 01:14:08.823
What?

01:14:10.124 --> 01:14:11.424
No!

01:14:32.314 --> 01:14:34.515
Sonny, what's happening?

01:14:34.517 --> 01:14:35.684
Mom.

01:14:37.019 --> 01:14:38.954
We need to get out of here!

01:15:37.682 --> 01:15:39.815
It's working!

01:15:39.817 --> 01:15:41.019
Go, kids!

01:16:22.461 --> 01:16:23.796
Hello?

01:16:25.097 --> 01:16:26.830
Someone called for me?

01:16:26.832 --> 01:16:30.502
- Sarah? Oh! Oh...
- Mom!

01:16:30.504 --> 01:16:32.237
Hello?

01:16:32.239 --> 01:16:34.572
I got your message.
I'm here.

01:16:34.574 --> 01:16:36.775
Don't worry.
Everything's going to be okay.

01:16:36.777 --> 01:16:39.110
I need typing paper,
a thesaurus,

01:16:39.112 --> 01:16:41.212
Diet Coke,
and a quiet place to compose.

01:16:41.214 --> 01:16:44.983
Preferably in a comfortable
chair with lumbar support.

01:16:44.985 --> 01:16:47.787
Are you R.L. Stine?

01:16:47.789 --> 01:16:50.723
Me? No, I'm Dr. Seuss.
R.L. Stine was unavailable.

01:16:50.725 --> 01:16:52.159
Yes, of course,
I'm R.L. Stine!

01:16:53.927 --> 01:16:56.798
Then I guess this
belongs to you.

01:16:57.732 --> 01:16:59.432
Don't open it.

01:17:01.436 --> 01:17:03.835
My first book.

01:17:05.606 --> 01:17:09.275
You realize I wrote this
when I was around your age.

01:17:09.277 --> 01:17:13.112
More of an amateur work, really,
but I am sure you'll all agree

01:17:13.114 --> 01:17:16.317
it shows the undeniable promise
of a brilliant young writer.

01:17:17.452 --> 01:17:18.984
Why do you have
a typewriter?

01:17:18.986 --> 01:17:21.354
I was going to
save you with it,

01:17:21.356 --> 01:17:24.056
although it appears you found
a way to save yourselves.

01:17:24.058 --> 01:17:26.793
- A typewriter?
- It's been done before.

01:17:26.795 --> 01:17:28.395
Once before.

01:17:28.397 --> 01:17:30.330
Maybe twice.

01:17:30.332 --> 01:17:32.064
Maybe more.

01:17:32.066 --> 01:17:33.999
Kathy?

01:17:34.001 --> 01:17:36.303
Walter, manager
at Fred's Pharmacy.

01:17:36.305 --> 01:17:37.537
It's nice to see you.

01:17:37.539 --> 01:17:39.673
Hi. It's nice to
see you too.

01:17:39.675 --> 01:17:41.241
What are you doing here?

01:17:41.243 --> 01:17:42.676
I don't know.

01:17:42.678 --> 01:17:45.045
Walter! Walter!
You got turned into a monster.

01:17:45.047 --> 01:17:47.715
You were big, green, ugly.
You were Slappy's henchman!

01:17:47.717 --> 01:17:50.083
Weather patterns.
Very strange weather patterns.

01:17:50.085 --> 01:17:52.252
But I think everything's
back to normal now.

01:17:52.254 --> 01:17:55.255
Fine. Okay, yeah,
the weather has been weird.

01:17:55.257 --> 01:17:56.824
It's true. Okay, thanks.

01:17:56.826 --> 01:17:58.659
What happened to your shirt?

01:17:58.661 --> 01:18:00.194
I don't know.

01:18:00.196 --> 01:18:02.163
<i>Ixnay</i> on the <i>onsters-may.</i>

01:18:02.165 --> 01:18:04.165
- Go ahead, <i>ollow-fay.</i>
- What?

01:18:04.167 --> 01:18:06.367
Means "follow." Pig Latin.

01:18:06.369 --> 01:18:09.404
Oh, the youth today.

01:18:09.406 --> 01:18:11.539
So funny running into you.

01:18:11.541 --> 01:18:15.376
Right? I always hoped we'd run
into each other outside of work.

01:18:15.378 --> 01:18:16.645
Yeah, me too.

01:18:16.647 --> 01:18:19.180
Hey, if you're not
busy next week,

01:18:19.182 --> 01:18:21.149
would you wanna
have some dinner?

01:18:21.151 --> 01:18:23.819
- Yeah. Yeah, heh, heh.
- Yeah? That's awesome.

01:18:23.821 --> 01:18:26.355
So they don't remember
what happened to them?

01:18:26.357 --> 01:18:27.723
The transmutation process

01:18:27.725 --> 01:18:29.725
seems to have wiped
their memories clean.

01:18:29.727 --> 01:18:32.227
All those who were affected
won't remember a thing.

01:18:39.537 --> 01:18:40.971
Tommy?

01:18:42.674 --> 01:18:45.708
- Are you okay?
- Oh, my God. Guys.

01:18:45.710 --> 01:18:47.710
I had this crazy dream.

01:18:47.712 --> 01:18:50.413
I'm so glad to see you.

01:18:50.415 --> 01:18:52.882
You know, can't believe
I'm saying this,

01:18:52.884 --> 01:18:54.950
but I'm glad
to see you too, Tommy.

01:18:54.952 --> 01:18:57.454
Kids falling
from the sky.

01:18:57.456 --> 01:18:59.724
My work here is done.

01:19:02.794 --> 01:19:04.461
I'm a writer too.

01:19:04.463 --> 01:19:08.965
Well, an aspiring,
very stuck writer at the moment.

01:19:08.967 --> 01:19:10.633
My condolences.

01:19:10.635 --> 01:19:13.069
All the horrors
in the world can't compare

01:19:13.071 --> 01:19:15.608
to the terrors
of the blank page.

01:19:18.243 --> 01:19:21.612
Um, any advice
on college essays?

01:19:21.614 --> 01:19:24.682
Well, first rule of writing:
write what you know.

01:19:24.684 --> 01:19:26.417
Thirty years,
and I couldn't figure out

01:19:26.419 --> 01:19:27.685
how this book should end.

01:19:27.687 --> 01:19:29.086
And somehow you figured out

01:19:29.088 --> 01:19:30.456
how to finish it
in one night.

01:19:31.858 --> 01:19:33.657
I believe in you.

01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:43.336
Hm. "Write what you know."

01:19:44.805 --> 01:19:46.771
<i>Recount a time in your life</i>

01:19:46.773 --> 01:19:49.708
<i>when you faced a fear,
challenge or failure.</i>

01:19:49.710 --> 01:19:52.109
<i>I think most of us
are afraid</i>

01:19:52.111 --> 01:19:54.312
<i>that we don't have
a story to tell.</i>

01:19:54.314 --> 01:19:57.282
<i>That there's nothing
special about us.</i>

01:19:57.284 --> 01:20:00.151
<i>And then a moment comes
when you least expect it</i>

01:20:00.153 --> 01:20:01.954
<i>where you have to step up,</i>

01:20:01.956 --> 01:20:04.122
<i>no matter
how terrified you are.</i>

01:20:04.124 --> 01:20:05.524
<i>But what
I've learned is that</i>

01:20:05.526 --> 01:20:07.158
<i>it's good to be scared
sometimes.</i>

01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:09.528
<i>Scared of losing
the people we love.</i>

01:20:09.530 --> 01:20:12.230
- Stop, stop!
- It's a ventriloquist dummy.

01:20:12.232 --> 01:20:14.132
- Oh.
- Really?

01:20:14.134 --> 01:20:15.701
- That's not funny, Mom.
- Too soon.

01:20:15.703 --> 01:20:17.302
No, I like it.

01:20:17.304 --> 01:20:19.305
Congratulations,
Sonny.

01:20:19.307 --> 01:20:21.172
Thank you so much,
Principal Harrison.

01:20:21.174 --> 01:20:23.709
<i>Or scared of not
achieving our dreams.</i>

01:20:23.711 --> 01:20:25.511
<i>Because those moments
remind us</i>

01:20:25.513 --> 01:20:27.780
<i>just how special
our stories really are.</i>

01:20:27.782 --> 01:20:29.417
- Here's to us.
- Indeed.

01:20:32.487 --> 01:20:35.488
- Hey, Sarah!
- Hi, Mr. Chu.

01:20:35.490 --> 01:20:36.859
Watch this.

01:20:39.662 --> 01:20:42.161
I like it.

01:20:42.163 --> 01:20:44.498
Yeah, I just made it
life-size this year.

01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:46.833
You know, just in case.

01:20:46.835 --> 01:20:48.802
No, seriously, you know,
just in case.

01:20:48.804 --> 01:20:51.805
Right. I'll see you later,
Mr. Chu.

01:20:51.807 --> 01:20:53.307
Bye!

01:20:55.177 --> 01:20:58.679
<i>And maybe when you
face enough of your fears</i>

01:20:58.681 --> 01:21:01.615
<i>life stops being
so scary after all.</i>

01:21:05.855 --> 01:21:08.823
Hey, honey.

01:21:08.825 --> 01:21:10.627
What happened?

01:21:12.194 --> 01:21:13.494
I got in.

01:21:13.496 --> 01:21:15.730
I knew it.
I knew you could do it.

01:21:15.732 --> 01:21:17.599
Oh, I'm so proud
of you!

01:21:19.736 --> 01:21:21.736
I guess I'm proud.

01:21:21.738 --> 01:21:25.607
- Thanks, Sonny.
- Come on, bring it in.

01:21:25.609 --> 01:21:27.542
Congratulations.

01:21:27.544 --> 01:21:30.045
Here, take off your jacket.

01:21:30.047 --> 01:21:32.547
Guys, give her some
ornaments, please.

01:21:32.549 --> 01:21:33.782
Oh, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

01:21:33.784 --> 01:21:36.085
- I'm so happy!
- Ha-ha-ha!

01:21:36.087 --> 01:21:38.421
- Here, put that right there.
- Yeah, I like that one.

01:21:45.730 --> 01:21:47.999
Finally, a new book.

01:21:51.402 --> 01:21:53.005
Yes.

01:22:02.914 --> 01:22:05.414
Hello, Papa.

01:22:05.416 --> 01:22:08.018
Slappy! I thought
the book got you.

01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:10.319
Maybe those others,
but not me.

01:22:10.321 --> 01:22:12.122
Why is that?

01:22:12.124 --> 01:22:14.189
You know
I always survive.

01:22:14.191 --> 01:22:16.126
You wrote me that way.

01:22:16.128 --> 01:22:20.764
In fact, I wrote my own story
while I was gone.

01:22:20.766 --> 01:22:22.766
And guess what.

01:22:22.768 --> 01:22:25.170
You're the main character.

01:22:26.238 --> 01:22:28.271
No.

01:22:28.273 --> 01:22:31.476
No!

01:22:32.945 --> 01:22:36.147
You try living in a book
for a while, Papa.

01:23:26.333 --> 01:23:27.666
Hyah!

01:23:33.373 --> 01:23:34.907
<i>Hands off!</i>

01:23:34.909 --> 01:23:36.945
Hiya! Look at my candle.

01:29:42.723 --> 01:29:44.957
<i>Slappy Halloween.</i>
