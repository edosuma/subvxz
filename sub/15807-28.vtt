00:03.537 --> 00:05.804
¶ Just sit right back
    and you'll hear a tale ¶

00:05.873 --> 00:08.006
¶ A tale of a fateful trip ¶

00:08.074 --> 00:10.476
¶ That started
    from this tropic port ¶

00:10.544 --> 00:12.610
¶ Aboard this tiny ship ¶

00:12.679 --> 00:14.979
¶ The mate was
     a mighty sailin' man ¶

00:15.048 --> 00:17.516
¶ The Skipper brave and sure ¶

00:17.585 --> 00:19.418
¶ Five passengers
      set sail that day ¶

00:19.486 --> 00:22.087
¶ For a three-hour tour ¶

00:22.156 --> 00:25.156
¶ A three-hour tour ¶

00:25.225 --> 00:26.591
[thunder rumbling]

00:26.660 --> 00:28.960
¶ The weather started
     getting rough ¶

00:29.029 --> 00:31.597
¶ The tiny ship was tossed ¶

00:31.665 --> 00:34.132
¶ If not for the courage
    of the fearless crew ¶

00:34.201 --> 00:35.934
¶ The Minnow would be lost ¶

00:36.003 --> 00:38.236
¶ The Minnow would be lost ¶

00:38.305 --> 00:40.338
¶ The ship set ground
     on the shore ¶

00:40.407 --> 00:43.041
¶ Of this uncharted
      desert isle ¶

01:16.810 --> 01:18.409
[all cheering]

01:18.478 --> 01:20.079
Come on, Howell. Come on.

01:20.147 --> 01:22.213
You've come
  from a long line of winners.

01:22.282 --> 01:25.083
The Howell silks
    across that line, baby.

01:25.152 --> 01:27.486
- 'Move.'
          - 'Come on.'

01:30.857 --> 01:31.890
[cheering continues]

01:31.959 --> 01:33.758
- This is a race, move.
    - Come on.

01:33.827 --> 01:35.260
[all screaming]

01:40.500 --> 01:42.067
See you later,
         Lovey darling.

01:42.135 --> 01:44.436
That was a wonderful race.
   Congratulations, Skipper.

01:44.504 --> 01:46.438
- You did it again, Skipper.
  - Did what again?

01:46.506 --> 01:48.907
- Lost for the 38th time.
   - No, no, 39th time.

01:48.976 --> 01:50.876
You see,
              I'm keeping track.

01:50.945 --> 01:52.744
No hard feelings,
I hope, Skipper.

01:52.812 --> 01:55.447
Naturally not, Howell.
 It's a pleasure losing to you.

01:55.516 --> 01:58.784
I lie awake, trying to figure
 how to make it easier for you.

01:58.852 --> 02:01.019
You gonna keep losing
         to Mr. Howell's turtle?

02:01.088 --> 02:02.854
We will have a race
day after tomorrow.

02:02.922 --> 02:04.522
- Alright with you?
   - You're gonna race again?

02:04.591 --> 02:06.258
- No.
          - 'No, no?'

02:06.327 --> 02:08.460
That doesn't sound like
    the Skipper we know.

02:08.529 --> 02:09.860
- Does it, Gilligan?
      - Yes, it does.

02:09.930 --> 02:11.730
He always gets grumpy
           when he doesn't win.

02:11.799 --> 02:15.233
You're not giving up after
  39 tries. Are you, Skipper?

02:15.302 --> 02:17.803
I'll never give up, Howell.
In fact, I'll beat you.

02:17.871 --> 02:19.805
Just that I haven't got
anything left to wager.

02:19.874 --> 02:21.506
- You've won it all.
      - That's right.

02:21.575 --> 02:23.308
Your sneakers, binoculars,
      compass, all that stuff.

02:23.376 --> 02:25.176
Thanks for
the itemized list, Gilligan.

02:25.245 --> 02:27.379
Well, of course, you're
    overlooking one prize.

02:27.447 --> 02:29.981
Mrs. Howell's done a magnificent
job of roughing it out here.

02:30.050 --> 02:32.784
Back home, let's face it,
  she does has downstairs maid

02:32.852 --> 02:36.154
upstairs maid, butler,
 chauffeur, all kinda services.

02:36.223 --> 02:38.924
Even here, she has me
    looking for a houseboy.

02:38.993 --> 02:40.425
A houseboy?

02:40.494 --> 02:43.462
But where on this island
   would one find a houseboy?

02:46.967 --> 02:49.168
Skipper, I'll bet you
     my 60-foot yacht

02:49.236 --> 02:51.136
against Gilligan's service
   as a houseboy

02:51.205 --> 02:53.005
until such time
    as we leave the island.

02:53.073 --> 02:57.142
Never. You can bet the
Queen Mary and I'll never do it.

02:57.211 --> 02:58.977
I'll pay him
   the same wages as you do.

02:59.046 --> 03:00.679
No, you won't, Howell.

03:00.748 --> 03:03.048
Nobody is gonna underpay
my little buddy except me.

03:03.117 --> 03:05.184
You're all heart,
               Skipper.

03:10.257 --> 03:12.391
[theme music]

03:15.228 --> 03:18.163
- What are you doing, Gilligan?
- Putting hay in the stable.

03:18.232 --> 03:19.364
Hay in the stable?

03:19.432 --> 03:21.365
It's only a turtle,
but after 39 races

03:21.434 --> 03:23.735
he must be beginning
to feel like a horse.

03:23.803 --> 03:25.937
As far as Mr. Howell's
          is concerned, yes.

03:26.006 --> 03:28.306
But, mine, you can put
          mine out to pasture.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.775
He likes it here.
Don't you, Rex?

03:30.844 --> 03:31.809
- Rex?
            - Yeah.

03:31.878 --> 03:34.512
He reminds me of a friend,
Rex Stonecipher.

03:34.581 --> 03:36.948
See, Skipper,
he knows me.

03:37.017 --> 03:38.116
Never mind that,
                Gilligan.

03:38.184 --> 03:40.419
Get rid of him
        and get a faster turtle.

03:40.487 --> 03:42.653
- But you were through racing.
 - I'm through losing.

03:42.722 --> 03:45.857
Oh, come on, Rex.
Here you go, boy.

03:45.926 --> 03:46.892
Bye-bye.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.427
[sighing]

03:50.697 --> 03:53.331
'Look, for 39 races,
      he ran in one spot.'

03:53.400 --> 03:57.469
Now he's moving like
he's going someplace in a hurry.

03:57.537 --> 03:59.638
- Gimme that carrot.
   - It's mine. Get your own.

03:59.707 --> 04:02.741
- Mary Ann has a whole garden.
 - I want to test something.

04:03.977 --> 04:05.377
[sighing]

04:08.181 --> 04:09.647
We're in, Gilligan.
      We're in.

04:09.716 --> 04:11.382
We finally found a way
to beat Howell's turtle.

04:11.451 --> 04:12.918
My turtle loves carrots.

04:12.986 --> 04:16.353
All you do is stand at the
finish line, wave a carrot..

04:16.423 --> 04:17.988
- What did you call him?
    - Who?

04:18.058 --> 04:19.791
- The turtle.
  - Oh, Rex. Rex Stonecipher.

04:19.860 --> 04:22.927
- Had an older brother, Max.
  - Never mind his brother.

04:22.996 --> 04:24.896
Oh, Gilligan. Hold this.

04:26.599 --> 04:28.366
Oh, attaboy.
Rexy baby.

04:28.435 --> 04:30.869
You're gonna win the next race
for me, aren't you?

04:32.739 --> 04:34.706
You have to stand
on the finish line

04:34.774 --> 04:36.775
hold a carrot
and we can't lose.

04:36.843 --> 04:38.510
Skipper, you win
                a 6-foot sloop.

04:38.579 --> 04:40.344
I'll be your first mate,
        we'll go--

04:40.413 --> 04:42.314
Hold it. Hold it.

04:42.382 --> 04:44.315
If I race Howell,
I'll be betting your services.

04:44.384 --> 04:45.684
Tell you what, Skipper.

04:45.753 --> 04:48.152
I insist you bet
       my service as a houseboy.

04:48.221 --> 04:50.721
You'll do it?
You insist?

04:50.790 --> 04:53.624
Oh, little buddy,
that's wonderful.

04:53.693 --> 04:56.494
You've, uh,
changed your mind?

04:56.563 --> 04:58.963
- I have.
  - You want to race me again?

04:59.032 --> 05:00.398
I do, Mr. Howell.

05:00.467 --> 05:02.533
Still willing to bet
Gilligan's services?

05:02.602 --> 05:05.103
I am, uh, that is, we are.

05:05.172 --> 05:07.672
- Why?
           - Why not?

05:07.740 --> 05:10.641
Look, Captain, I didn't get
into my present exalted position

05:10.710 --> 05:13.512
in the world of finance by
accepting things at face value.

05:13.580 --> 05:16.381
You think you have
a chance of winning.

05:16.450 --> 05:19.784
The question before
the board is...how come?

05:19.853 --> 05:23.187
No secret, fact is we've knitted
a pair of wings for my turtle

05:23.256 --> 05:26.058
and he's gonna fly through
  the air with greatest of ease.

05:31.831 --> 05:34.699
Mr. Howell, turtles couldn't fly
even if they did have wings.

05:34.768 --> 05:36.401
Ginger, kindly
pay attention.

05:36.469 --> 05:38.704
Certainly not if
         the wings were knitted.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.705
I think that Skipper's
          pulling your leg.

05:40.773 --> 05:43.375
Never mind my leg, it's
his sleeve I'm worried about.

05:43.443 --> 05:44.876
He's got something up it.

05:44.945 --> 05:47.712
Oh, and you want me
         to find out what it is.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.948
Ha ha, you're right
on the target, girl.

05:50.017 --> 05:52.751
- From Gilligan, of course.
  - Bull's eye.

05:52.819 --> 05:55.820
Don't back away, Gilligan.
      I just wanna talk to you.

05:55.889 --> 05:57.889
I'm not, just that
my-my back itches

05:57.958 --> 06:00.224
and I'm gonna scratch it
on the tree.

06:00.293 --> 06:02.394
I'll scratch it for you.

06:02.462 --> 06:04.696
You know, Gilligan,
    when I'm a famous movie star

06:04.765 --> 06:07.866
I'm gonna have my own yacht
     and you can be my captain.

06:07.935 --> 06:09.801
A little lower.

06:09.869 --> 06:12.870
And we'll sail away to
  magic ports of call, won't we?

06:12.939 --> 06:15.540
Yeah, a little,
little bit to the left.

06:15.609 --> 06:17.409
- How's that?
         - Oh, yeah.

06:17.478 --> 06:20.579
Oh, I can't be your captain
because I've got to be

06:20.647 --> 06:22.680
the first mate for-for
the Skipper and his yacht.

06:22.749 --> 06:25.350
Oh, you mean, the one
          Mr. Howell is bidding?

06:25.419 --> 06:27.518
Uh-huh,
a little bit higher.

06:27.587 --> 06:29.220
- Gilligan..
          - Huh?

06:29.289 --> 06:32.557
Do you have a turtle that's
     faster than Mr. Howell's?

06:32.626 --> 06:34.526
I'm not allowed to tell
anything about that.

06:34.594 --> 06:36.528
Oh, you can tell me
             about it.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.463
How's that? Is that
             the right spot?

06:38.532 --> 06:40.832
Yeah. That's it.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.901
Tell me about everything,
       Gilligan.

06:44.138 --> 06:46.037
So you told her everything, eh?

06:46.106 --> 06:49.907
Then she ran from you to Howell
and told him everything.

06:49.976 --> 06:52.777
Gilligan, I've taught you what
to do when Ginger was after you.

06:52.846 --> 06:54.546
Sorry, I tried to remember.

06:54.614 --> 06:56.414
- But-but--
          - But what?

06:56.483 --> 06:58.249
She started scratching my back
against a tree

06:58.318 --> 07:01.186
found a favorite spot, and I
don't know what my mouth said.

07:02.689 --> 07:07.225
Gilligan, I don't want
anymore talking. You understand?

07:07.294 --> 07:10.995
Luckily, Mr. Howell can't
do anything about this.

07:11.064 --> 07:13.798
- Morning, Mary Ann.
  - Hi, Skipper. Hi, Gilligan.

07:13.866 --> 07:16.734
- What's the matter?
   - I'm not allowed to talk.

07:16.803 --> 07:19.337
Mary Ann, could we have
a couple of your carrots?

07:19.406 --> 07:22.840
I'm sorry, Skipper, not unless
Mr. Howell says it's okay.

07:22.909 --> 07:26.811
What? W-w-what's Mr. Howell
got to do with your carrots?

07:26.880 --> 07:29.647
Well, his carrots. He bought
  them over an hour ago.

07:29.716 --> 07:31.749
Five thousand dollars
     for 50 carrots.

07:31.818 --> 07:35.553
Fifty carrots
                   for $5,000?

07:35.622 --> 07:36.787
How's your
         long division, Skipper?

07:36.856 --> 07:39.991
Oh, never mind
my long division, Gilligan.

07:40.060 --> 07:41.659
If we can't have carrots

07:41.728 --> 07:43.761
we'll try some of your turnips.
Maybe they'll work.

07:43.830 --> 07:45.630
I'm sorry, Skipper.

07:45.698 --> 07:48.500
- He bought those too?
     - Mm-hm.

07:48.569 --> 07:50.701
All eight plants for $4,000.

07:50.770 --> 07:53.138
Eight plants
                    for $4,000?

07:55.441 --> 07:58.743
Never mind
the long division, Gilligan.

07:58.811 --> 08:01.312
All that you have left is your
wild lettuce. We'll try that.

08:01.381 --> 08:04.148
- He bought that too.
     - He bought that too.

08:04.217 --> 08:05.550
Three thousand dollars.

08:05.619 --> 08:07.285
Three thousand dollars
     for the wild lettuce

08:07.354 --> 08:09.687
and 9,000 and then 4,000

08:09.756 --> 08:12.023
and 4,000 is..

08:12.091 --> 08:14.825
- Gilligan, would you stop that?
- I think I'm all mixed up.

08:14.894 --> 08:16.627
Well, I'll straighten
you out, mate.

08:16.696 --> 08:18.729
Find something
that's as good as carrots.

08:18.798 --> 08:20.631
Something that my turtle
will like better.

08:20.700 --> 08:23.234
And do it before the race
so I can win.

08:23.303 --> 08:25.103
That's an order.

08:29.542 --> 08:31.476
- Hi, Professor.
        - Hi, Gilligan.

08:31.545 --> 08:33.244
I'm glad you got
        shipped wrecked with us.

08:33.312 --> 08:36.380
I'm not sure, but I know
you meant it as a compliment.

08:36.448 --> 08:37.916
I do. You're
                    a smart man.

08:37.985 --> 08:39.951
- You know lots of things.
   - Such as?

08:40.019 --> 08:42.520
What our turtle would eat
    since we don't have carrots.

08:42.589 --> 08:44.322
I'm not an authority
on that subject.

08:44.390 --> 08:45.857
You see, I'm not
a herpetologist.

08:45.926 --> 08:48.226
That's okay because he isn't
    a herp, he's a turtle.

08:48.294 --> 08:49.560
A herpetologist is--

08:49.629 --> 08:51.796
Professor, what do you think
    he'd like to eat?

08:51.865 --> 08:55.366
Well, you might try
seaweed or moss

08:55.435 --> 08:56.534
or plants
or even grass.

08:56.602 --> 08:57.802
- I'm really--
    - Seaweed, grass, moss.

08:57.870 --> 08:59.971
Okay, thanks a lot,
             Professor.

09:02.609 --> 09:04.408
Seaweed is rich
     in iron and vitamin C

09:04.477 --> 09:05.910
just like in orange juice.

09:05.979 --> 09:08.947
You'd run when you see me
holding seaweed at finish line.

09:09.015 --> 09:11.883
'And it'll make you grow up
  to be a strong turtle.'

09:11.951 --> 09:14.952
Besides that, it tastes good.
 Just look at Gilligan.

09:15.021 --> 09:17.789
Look happy, like you're
    eating some steak.

09:19.593 --> 09:21.626
See? Gilligan just
      loves it. Don't you?

09:21.694 --> 09:23.527
I hate it.

09:23.596 --> 09:26.698
Turtle will hear it.
      Eat some more.

09:30.603 --> 09:32.904
Maybe you'd rather
    have some of this grass.

09:33.673 --> 09:35.106
Here we are.

09:36.943 --> 09:39.311
You make that grass
      look good, Gilligan.

09:43.616 --> 09:46.684
Down to the moss now.

09:46.753 --> 09:49.120
Here, try some moss.

09:50.991 --> 09:54.225
'Here, Gilligan. Make
     the moss look good.'

09:58.432 --> 10:00.966
Gilligan, he's eating the moss.

10:02.402 --> 10:03.802
He's eating the moss.

10:03.870 --> 10:06.171
We're back in business.
    We're back in business.

10:08.374 --> 10:10.175
That's it.

10:11.645 --> 10:13.211
'Eat!'

10:16.048 --> 10:18.550
(Skipper)
    'Come on, turtle, move.
    Spin a little.'

10:18.618 --> 10:19.684
- 'Get up there.'
       - 'Come on.'

10:19.753 --> 10:21.886
'Oh, no. He's winning again.'

10:21.955 --> 10:23.655
(Howell)
          'Ha ha ha.'

10:27.326 --> 10:29.527
What went wrong, Gilligan?
   What happened?

10:29.596 --> 10:32.964
I don't know, Skipper. He sure
 went for the moss in practice.

10:33.033 --> 10:35.133
- In practice? What practice?
 - We practiced all afternoon.

10:35.202 --> 10:38.136
He must have put away
25-30 pounds of moss..

10:38.205 --> 10:40.171
Nice try, Skipper.
       Come on, Gilligan.

10:40.239 --> 10:42.473
Mrs. Howell has a million
  and one things to show you

10:42.542 --> 10:44.008
before you serve us our dinner.

10:44.076 --> 10:46.645
- Goodbye, Skipper.
   - Houseboy, there you go.

10:51.484 --> 10:52.651
[theme music]

10:54.387 --> 10:56.921
Darling, I'm so delighted
  that your turtle won the race.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.290
Yes, it does make life
more bearable, doesn't it, mm?

10:59.358 --> 11:02.059
I just adore having a butler
    and an upstairs maid

11:02.128 --> 11:04.561
a downstairs maid
       and a cook and a gardener

11:04.630 --> 11:08.266
and a chauffeur and a houseboy,
even if Gilligan is all of them.

11:08.335 --> 11:11.502
Even here, I can provide
my wife with a staff of servant.

11:11.571 --> 11:15.106
Staff of servant.
      Darling, you're brilliant.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.208
Where's that boy
with my drink? Gilligan!

11:17.277 --> 11:19.910
- 'Coming, Mr. Howell.'
   - Hurry up, will you, huh?

11:19.979 --> 11:22.313
- Your drink, sir.
       - Oh, thank you.

11:22.382 --> 11:24.315
Gilligan, help me
               with this yarn.

11:24.384 --> 11:25.750
- Certainly, Mrs. Howell.
   - My, my!

11:25.818 --> 11:27.918
The market is going
higher and higher.

11:27.987 --> 11:29.921
How did you get
a newspaper on the island?

11:29.990 --> 11:33.725
My news boy has
      a strong right arm.

11:33.794 --> 11:36.361
We've had that same paper ever
  since we were ship wrecked.

11:36.429 --> 11:39.764
Mr. Howell reads
   the financial page every day.

11:39.832 --> 11:41.966
The market doesn't go up
    and it's very comforting

11:42.035 --> 11:44.235
because it doesn't
       go down either.

11:44.304 --> 11:47.205
This punch is off. Put some more
papaya or something in it.

11:47.274 --> 11:49.974
- Certainly, Mr. Howell.
    - Alright.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.942
Gilligan, my yarn.

11:52.011 --> 11:53.144
Oh, sorry, Mrs. Howell.

11:53.212 --> 11:55.646
You're getting me
all tangled up, son.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.183
- What's the matter with you?
 - Oh, Gilligan, this way.

11:59.586 --> 12:00.819
Oh, Gilligan!

12:00.887 --> 12:02.086
Gilligan!

12:02.155 --> 12:03.421
Oh!

12:06.959 --> 12:09.827
Right.
There goes the whole..

12:09.896 --> 12:11.762
...New York Exchange.

12:11.831 --> 12:13.765
Oh, my beautiful knitting.

12:21.874 --> 12:23.241
Hello, Professor.

12:23.309 --> 12:25.043
You really miss Gilligan,
       don't you, Skipper?

12:25.111 --> 12:27.345
I do. It's not
the same around the hut.

12:27.414 --> 12:30.481
I mean, nobody to yell at,
that is discuss things a bit.

12:30.550 --> 12:34.485
He used to help me with chores.
I'm like a ship without rudder.

12:34.554 --> 12:37.021
We all go through
    this sort of thing, Skipper.

12:37.089 --> 12:39.590
We don't appreciate what
        we got until we lose it.

12:39.659 --> 12:41.993
I suppose you're right.

12:42.061 --> 12:43.061
Where are you going?

12:43.129 --> 12:45.897
Over to visit what I lost.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.503
Gilligan. Hey, Gilligan.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.138
Tradesmen around
the rear, please.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.707
It's me,
                   your Skipper.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.275
Do you have
an appointment?

12:58.344 --> 13:00.044
Need an appointment
         to see my little buddy?

13:00.113 --> 13:01.512
No, to see the Howells.

13:01.581 --> 13:04.449
Besides being a houseboy,
I'm a butler and a chauffeur.

13:04.517 --> 13:05.650
Chauffeur?

13:05.718 --> 13:07.919
That part is easy.
We don't have a car.

13:07.987 --> 13:09.687
I think they're
                overworking you.

13:09.756 --> 13:12.490
You must feel like a prisoner
   here taking all these jobs.

13:12.559 --> 13:15.993
No, Skipper. I get
every other Thursday off.

13:16.062 --> 13:17.895
- You don't miss me.
      - I miss you.

13:17.964 --> 13:20.098
- Miss you a lot.
    - Nobody to yell at you?

13:20.166 --> 13:22.133
Mr. Howell yells
but not half as loud.

13:22.202 --> 13:24.435
The place is messy
but not messy as ours.

13:24.503 --> 13:26.270
Mrs. Howell can't give orders.
She says "please."

13:26.339 --> 13:28.072
What do you expect
              from a woman?

13:28.141 --> 13:29.974
I miss being
your first mate.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.843
I'll get you back,
              little buddy.

13:31.911 --> 13:33.378
How? You've
nothing left to bet.

13:33.446 --> 13:35.546
I have, Skipper, look.
It's my boy's scout knife.

13:35.614 --> 13:38.549
There's a spoon and there's
a fork and there's a blade

13:38.618 --> 13:40.217
a nail file and tweezers

13:40.286 --> 13:42.253
a key ring and a corkscrew.
Take it.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.288
N-no, Gilligan, I couldn't.
     Suppose I lose?

13:44.356 --> 13:47.625
He'll have me and the knife
and I'll use it as much as now.

13:47.693 --> 13:50.194
- If you win, you win me back.
 - No, Gilligan.

13:50.263 --> 13:52.229
I shouldn't have bet
           you against his sloop

13:52.298 --> 13:54.565
and to take your possession,
    I couldn't do it.

13:54.634 --> 13:57.836
- Even if I insist?
     - Even if you insist.

13:59.738 --> 14:02.006
Mr. Howell, it would've
     brought tears to your eyes.

14:02.074 --> 14:04.241
From laughing. Get on
with your housework, boy?

14:04.310 --> 14:05.410
Please,
                  one more race?

14:05.478 --> 14:07.478
The Skipper has
nothing left to wager.

14:07.547 --> 14:09.246
He has my
                boy scout knife.

14:09.315 --> 14:11.915
- The one with the corkscrew?
- Yeah, screwdriver, nail file.

14:11.984 --> 14:13.284
- And the compass?
        - Yeah.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.252
And a can opener,
     key ring and tweezers.

14:15.321 --> 14:17.254
You're leaving something out.

14:17.323 --> 14:19.991
- Huh? Oh, knife blade.
    - Yes, yes.

14:20.060 --> 14:22.359
Gilligan, my boy,
I'll admit that I've had my eye

14:22.428 --> 14:24.562
on that knife
for some time, but, uh

14:24.631 --> 14:27.197
how come you're willing
to bet your dearest possession?

14:27.266 --> 14:28.933
After all, I've won
40 races.

14:29.001 --> 14:31.235
What makes you think
I'm gonna start losing now?

14:31.304 --> 14:33.337
I was thinking, maybe,
        if you lost on purpose--

14:33.406 --> 14:36.540
Me, a Howell,
lose on purpose?

14:36.609 --> 14:38.743
But you have everything,
       yachts, oil wells, banks.

14:38.812 --> 14:40.311
And money.

14:40.379 --> 14:42.213
Big corporations.
     Everybody looks up to you..

14:42.282 --> 14:43.815
What does
           the Skipper have? Me!

14:43.883 --> 14:47.184
It's all he has and...
   Mr. Howell, it'd mean so much

14:47.253 --> 14:50.087
for him to win me
  and little for you to lose me.

14:50.156 --> 14:51.321
Please, Mr. Howell?

14:51.390 --> 14:53.524
Gilligan, my boy,
you're a fine young man.

14:53.593 --> 14:56.694
Your story would melt a man
with a heart of stone.

14:56.763 --> 14:58.896
But, fortunately,
my cronies call me

14:58.965 --> 15:01.532
"Old, granite heart, Howell."

15:01.601 --> 15:04.001
Gilligan, tell the Skipper
I'm willing to race.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.436
May the best turtle win.

15:05.505 --> 15:07.204
Naturally, I have
the best turtles.

15:07.273 --> 15:11.041
No one challenges a Howell
  and comes through unscaved.

15:11.110 --> 15:14.078
- Comes through what?
     - Unscaved.

15:14.147 --> 15:16.881
Oh, Mr. Howell, after
   you through unscaving him

15:16.950 --> 15:18.682
will he be able to scave again?

15:18.751 --> 15:20.151
Don't ever say that, will you?

15:20.220 --> 15:22.753
- Yes, sir.
        - And, Gilligan.

15:22.822 --> 15:24.321
Take good care
of my knife.

15:24.390 --> 15:27.124
- You mean my knife?
      - Until the race.

15:27.193 --> 15:30.094
If the Skipper
is man enough to race me.

15:36.435 --> 15:38.536
Imagine the nerve
    of that houseboy, Lovey.

15:38.604 --> 15:42.173
Asking Thurston Howell
  to let the Skipper win a race.

15:42.241 --> 15:44.175
Well, after all, dear,
Gilligan's vote

15:44.243 --> 15:46.077
is strictly humanitarian.

15:46.145 --> 15:47.545
Yeah, those are
                the worse kinds.

15:47.614 --> 15:51.415
Darling, the Skipper's awfully
unhappy without Gilligan.

15:51.483 --> 15:55.219
If you don't see tears, it's
'cause I'm crying on the inside.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.154
Darling, we don't really
need a houseboy.

15:57.223 --> 15:59.022
There's nothing
for him to do.

15:59.091 --> 16:00.424
Well, I'm simply aghast.

16:00.493 --> 16:02.793
Mrs. Thurston Howell is used
    to a staff of servants.

16:02.862 --> 16:06.230
Yes, I know, dear, but I've
grown used to doing without.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.833
Spoken like a true aristocrat
   and I'm very proud of you.

16:08.902 --> 16:11.301
Even here marooned on this
 island as Chairman of the Board

16:11.370 --> 16:13.538
I can still provide you
    with some creature comforts.

16:13.606 --> 16:14.972
Oh, in other words--

16:15.041 --> 16:18.042
In other words, I will not lose
 to the Skipper on purpose.

16:18.110 --> 16:20.044
Now, the matter
                is closed, dear.

16:23.216 --> 16:26.250
It says, uh, "Very soon now,
    you're gonna meet

16:26.319 --> 16:28.586
a big, strong, handsome man."

16:28.655 --> 16:30.154
Huh! Fat chance.

16:30.223 --> 16:32.090
Not unless one drops out
of an airplane.

16:32.158 --> 16:34.291
If your horoscope says,
         you're gonna meet him.

16:34.360 --> 16:37.261
Where am I gonna meet
a big, strong, handsome man?

16:37.330 --> 16:38.562
- Hi, girls.
         - Hi, Skipper.

16:38.631 --> 16:40.331
There he is,
      a big-strong-handsome man.

16:40.399 --> 16:42.166
And you just met him.

16:42.235 --> 16:45.135
Ginger, the Skipper's been
with us now for several months.

16:45.204 --> 16:47.204
Let me see what else
            your horoscope says.

16:47.273 --> 16:49.306
It says, "If you
     don't believe in horoscopes

16:49.375 --> 16:51.775
why don't you go back
      to your vegetable garden?"

16:51.844 --> 16:54.244
Oh, well,
guess I will.

16:54.313 --> 16:57.548
Uh, bye, Mary Ann.
What was that all about?

16:57.617 --> 16:59.717
I was just reading
         her horoscope, Skipper.

16:59.786 --> 17:02.753
Like me to read yours? You know,
you-you'd be surprised.

17:02.821 --> 17:05.589
If you really follow it,
     everything works out right.

17:05.657 --> 17:08.992
- What day is your birthday?
  - Um, uh, the 5th of May.

17:09.061 --> 17:11.127
Oh, you're Taurus.

17:11.196 --> 17:12.963
You're under
           the sign of the bull.

17:13.031 --> 17:15.266
I knew I was under
the sign of something.

17:15.334 --> 17:18.002
I thought it was
the eight ball.

17:18.070 --> 17:20.671
Oh, let's see.
           The 16th is your day.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.807
Sixteen, that'll be tomorrow.

17:22.875 --> 17:26.710
Yeah, it says,
      "Strike hard, strike fast.

17:26.779 --> 17:28.244
"The race is to the swift.

17:28.314 --> 17:31.549
And on the 16th,
      you will be the swiftest."

17:31.618 --> 17:33.918
Th-the race?
Is that what it says?

17:33.986 --> 17:35.385
- I'll be the swiftest?
    - Yeah.

17:35.454 --> 17:37.655
It says, "A day's delay
    will be too late.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.523
Seize your opportunity
          by the horns."

17:39.592 --> 17:41.092
I guess that's because
          you're Taurus.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.860
"And win, win, win."

17:42.929 --> 17:45.762
I'll do it, Ginger.
Thanks a million, I'll do it.

17:45.831 --> 17:48.198
- Don't wanna hear the rest?
  - Oh, no, I've heard enough.

17:48.267 --> 17:50.067
Thank you. Good news.

17:50.135 --> 17:51.469
[whistles]

17:52.571 --> 17:53.571
[knocking]

17:53.640 --> 17:56.974
(Skipper)
   'Gilligan. Hey, Gilligan.'

17:57.043 --> 17:58.709
Who's there?

17:58.778 --> 18:02.313
You know who's there.
           I'll do it.

18:02.382 --> 18:03.714
I'll bet
            your boy scout knife

18:03.783 --> 18:05.682
against Howell,
          if he'll bet you back.

18:05.751 --> 18:09.319
Now, understand. I'll race him,
 but it's got to be tomorrow.

18:09.388 --> 18:10.888
- Why?
  - Well, because I'm Taurus.

18:10.957 --> 18:12.256
Where?

18:12.324 --> 18:14.158
Never mind, Gilligan.

18:14.226 --> 18:15.793
Just tell Howell
         I'll race him tomorrow.

18:15.861 --> 18:16.994
- Okay?
            - Yeah.

18:17.063 --> 18:19.263
- Tomorrow.
      - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:20.066 --> 18:21.298
Hey, Mrs. Howell.

18:21.367 --> 18:23.367
The Skipper seems
             terribly confident.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.670
Yeah, I just wish I was.

18:42.155 --> 18:44.388
All I'm trying to do
      is make Thurston

18:44.456 --> 18:48.893
be the kind of man he really is,
despite himself.

18:48.961 --> 18:52.497
Now, I'll just
   change you turtles around.

18:52.565 --> 18:55.666
The Skipper's turtle
      will go in our pen.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.201
There!

18:58.270 --> 19:00.404
Oh, our turtle's bigger.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.373
Oh, and our turtle..

19:04.143 --> 19:06.144
...goes in this pen.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.079
There!

19:09.148 --> 19:10.615
I almost forgot.

19:17.857 --> 19:19.190
There!

19:20.893 --> 19:22.626
Now, the Skipper will win

19:22.695 --> 19:25.897
and Gilligan can go back
    where he belongs.

19:45.351 --> 19:47.651
Ah, thank goodness, it's night.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.920
And no one can
      see what I'm doing.

19:49.989 --> 19:52.689
Word ever got back to the States
that Thurston Howell

19:52.758 --> 19:55.292
deliberately did a good deed,
 I'll lose my window seat

19:55.361 --> 19:57.260
at the Union League Club.

19:57.329 --> 19:59.764
Forgive me. Here we go.

19:59.832 --> 20:01.665
[laughing]

20:01.734 --> 20:02.900
Oh, you little..

20:02.969 --> 20:04.768
Here we are.

20:04.837 --> 20:07.205
Don't mind, do you?
      Let's see, now.

20:09.108 --> 20:10.608
The Howell.

20:15.314 --> 20:17.147
Ingenious, hm?

20:17.216 --> 20:19.016
[sighs]

20:19.085 --> 20:21.718
Perfect crime.

20:21.787 --> 20:23.554
You, cunning..

20:29.862 --> 20:33.698
I'll be darned. I must have
  reached him after all.

20:33.766 --> 20:35.065
[knocking]

20:35.134 --> 20:36.600
Yes, who is it?

20:36.669 --> 20:38.569
- Your ex-first mate.
     - Gilligan!

20:38.637 --> 20:40.638
My little buddy. You..

20:42.141 --> 20:43.173
- Oh!
       - No, no, Skipper.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.842
Just came to tell you
don't worry.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.910
- You're gonna win tomorrow.
  - You bet I will.

20:46.979 --> 20:49.446
Granite-hearted Howell switched
turtles, you got the fast one.

20:49.515 --> 20:51.949
- He what?
    - I saw him do it, yeah.

20:52.018 --> 20:54.184
I don't wanna win
              the race that way.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.452
You wanna win me back?

20:55.521 --> 20:57.187
Certainly, I do,
        Gilligan, but honorably.

20:57.256 --> 21:00.224
Could you sleep nights, knowing
 that that race was fixed?

21:00.293 --> 21:02.059
- I could sleep anytime.
    - Well, I couldn't.

21:02.127 --> 21:05.529
We're going and putting those
 turtles back where they belong.

21:05.598 --> 21:06.697
[sighs]

21:56.282 --> 21:57.648
- He what?
           - Shh.

21:59.017 --> 22:00.283
He changed them back.

22:00.352 --> 22:02.219
After the trouble I went
so he'd win?

22:02.287 --> 22:03.720
He doesn't
             wanna win that way.

22:03.789 --> 22:07.224
- You know what he's doing?
  - Scaving? Unscaving?

22:07.293 --> 22:10.594
Don't look a gift horse in the
mouth. I won't stand for it.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.629
When Howell
makes up his mind to be

22:12.698 --> 22:14.331
a decent honest person,
nobody, shh

22:14.399 --> 22:16.033
and I repeat, nobody
stands in his way.

22:16.102 --> 22:17.968
Good for you,
         Mr. Decent Human Being.

22:18.037 --> 22:21.004
Go put the turtles
the way they were, hurry up.

22:21.073 --> 22:23.374
Say goodnight
to teddy.

22:50.369 --> 22:51.434
No, go back.

22:51.503 --> 22:52.970
You're not supposed
      to win.

22:53.039 --> 22:54.705
Don't go back
that way.

22:56.942 --> 22:58.875
(Professor)
   'Slow down. Not so fast.'

22:58.944 --> 23:01.244
- Don't win. Please don't.
   - He's gonna win again.

23:01.313 --> 23:04.314
Come on, get a move on.

23:04.383 --> 23:06.183
- 'Come on.'
     - 'Come on, Skipper.'

23:06.252 --> 23:09.954
- Oh, Skipper.
  - Very good, come on, Tiger.

23:10.022 --> 23:12.856
(Howell)
       'No, don't finish.
       Fall or anything.'

23:12.925 --> 23:18.028
No, go back. You are not
   supposed to win this time.

23:18.097 --> 23:20.631
You're not supposed
      to win this time.

23:20.700 --> 23:23.534
Oh, it can't be.
It just can't be.

23:24.770 --> 23:27.104
- My knife.
          - His knife.

23:27.173 --> 23:29.840
I-I tried to be nice.
     I really tried.

23:29.909 --> 23:33.110
But I-I still came out
     on top. I mean, what..

23:43.523 --> 23:45.021
Ah, there you are, Skipper.

23:45.090 --> 23:47.257
Any of that good,
        old betting spirit left?

23:47.325 --> 23:50.161
I have a pebble in one
   of these hands and you guess.

23:50.229 --> 23:52.963
If you guess which hand
        has the pebble, you win.

23:53.032 --> 23:55.799
Go ahead, go ahead.
         Choose one, choose one.

23:55.868 --> 23:58.435
There you are.
                I win, you lose.

23:58.504 --> 24:00.471
Which means you
              get Gilligan back.

24:00.540 --> 24:02.806
- Gilligan.
        - You rang, sir?

24:02.875 --> 24:05.442
- I'm giving you to the Skipper.
- Skipper?

24:05.510 --> 24:07.744
But I thought you said
I lost the bet.

24:07.813 --> 24:09.880
Exactly. You see, when
        Gilligan was my houseboy

24:09.948 --> 24:14.485
he washed my shirts
      and he ironed my trousers.

24:14.554 --> 24:16.519
When you're betting
        to see who gets Gilligan

24:16.588 --> 24:18.823
the loser is the winner.

24:20.092 --> 24:21.525
Go away.

24:34.707 --> 24:36.806
¶ They're here
    for a long long time ¶

24:36.875 --> 24:39.409
¶ They'll have to make
     the best of things ¶

24:39.478 --> 24:41.011
¶ It's an uphill climb ¶

24:41.080 --> 24:43.447
¶ The first mate
     and his Skipper too ¶

24:43.516 --> 24:45.515
¶ Will do their very best ¶

24:45.584 --> 24:47.651
¶ To make
    the others comfortable ¶

24:47.720 --> 24:49.719
¶ In the tropic island nest ¶

24:49.788 --> 24:52.188
¶ No phone, no lights,
     no motorcars ¶

24:52.257 --> 24:54.324
¶ Not a single luxury ¶

24:54.393 --> 24:56.526
¶ Like Robinson Crusoe ¶

24:56.595 --> 24:58.295
¶ It's primitive as can be ¶

24:58.363 --> 25:00.697
¶ So join us here
     each week my friends ¶

25:00.766 --> 25:02.866
¶ You're sure to get a smile ¶

25:02.935 --> 25:05.102
¶ From seven stranded
     castaways ¶

25:05.170 --> 25:07.071
¶ Here on Gilligan's isle ¶¶
