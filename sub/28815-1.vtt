00:13.298 --> 00:16.955
August 21, 1996.

00:16.957 --> 00:19.785
His name is Cecil Stevens.

00:19.787 --> 00:21.304
Yeah, that's him.

00:21.306 --> 00:24.825
He like basketball, Ninja
Turtles, Creepy Crawlers,

00:24.827 --> 00:27.690
and this whole thing
is kind of about him.

00:27.692 --> 00:30.453
I mean, if you don't
count the real star.

00:33.525 --> 00:36.215
Tim, it's gross,
it's unhygienic.

00:36.217 --> 00:38.459
Not to mention, I stepped
on one the other day.

00:38.461 --> 00:39.736
I had to dig it out of my...

00:39.738 --> 00:41.151
Lorrie, maybe if you
spent less time worrying

00:41.153 --> 00:43.222
about my toenails and more time,

00:43.224 --> 00:45.466
are you standing there with
the refrigerator door open?

00:45.468 --> 00:48.299
Am I the only here that cares
about the electricity bill?

00:50.059 --> 00:53.787
They're, um, how
do I put this, crazy.

00:58.343 --> 00:59.549
Did you put a toenail?

00:59.551 --> 01:01.862
How does
that feel, baby?

01:03.141 --> 01:05.661
The toenails in the food,

01:06.558 --> 01:09.387
that's too far.

01:10.631 --> 01:11.975
But the lights have
been on for 20 minutes,

01:11.977 --> 01:13.908
the electricity bill!

01:13.910 --> 01:17.397
Very mature,
Lorrie, very mature.

01:20.123 --> 01:21.537
I think it's time
Cecil and I go stay

01:21.539 --> 01:23.435
with grandma Peggy for a while.

01:23.437 --> 01:24.609
What?

01:24.611 --> 01:26.852
But Cecil starts
school in like two days.

01:26.854 --> 01:28.304
I'm transferring him over.

01:29.374 --> 01:31.754
So you know how
when bad things happen

01:31.756 --> 01:33.376
people say, you never know,

01:33.378 --> 01:36.137
this may be the best thing
that ever happened to you?

01:36.139 --> 01:38.521
Yeah, yeah this isn't
one of those times.

02:20.563 --> 02:21.424
Fire!

02:21.426 --> 02:22.289
Ah!

02:25.257 --> 02:27.708
Are you kidding me right now?

02:29.158 --> 02:29.986
Retreat!

02:44.380 --> 02:46.276
My glasses!

02:46.278 --> 02:48.658
I can't see, I can't see.

02:48.660 --> 02:50.177
Oh no!

02:50.179 --> 02:51.422
Just kidding.

02:56.185 --> 02:57.013
Bonjour.

02:58.463 --> 03:00.774
Well I see you
two already met.

03:00.776 --> 03:01.913
Hey Grandma!

03:01.915 --> 03:05.468
Oh, for Pete's sake, oh.

03:05.470 --> 03:07.953
You have become a giant, Cecil.

03:07.955 --> 03:10.441
A giant wet swamp monster!

03:11.338 --> 03:12.268
Hey mom.

03:12.270 --> 03:13.718
Thank you for letting us stay.

03:13.720 --> 03:14.583
Don't ask.

03:15.515 --> 03:16.479
Hi there.

03:16.481 --> 03:17.998
The name's Abby.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.277
The neighborhood rugrat
and my partner in crime.

03:23.488 --> 03:26.247
Okay, hello there Abby.

03:26.249 --> 03:27.076
And Cecil, I'm very,

03:27.078 --> 03:29.837
I'm very proud of you.

03:29.839 --> 03:30.668
For what?

03:33.671 --> 03:37.468
Thinks she's got a severe
case of the grownups.

03:39.815 --> 03:41.849
Well, I was just leaving.

03:41.851 --> 03:43.195
Nice to meet you, Cecil.

03:43.197 --> 03:44.060
Bye.

03:45.614 --> 03:47.130
I saw you checking her out.

03:47.132 --> 03:49.512
What, no, mmm-mmm.

03:49.514 --> 03:52.411
I saw you, Cecil.

03:54.346 --> 03:57.140
Seven p.m., quiet.

03:57.142 --> 03:59.559
The mother Lorrie
looks disheveled.

04:01.250 --> 04:06.289
Could be suffering from
constipation.

04:18.612 --> 04:20.267
Ah, it hit my eye!

04:20.269 --> 04:21.095
Oh crap.

04:21.096 --> 04:22.096
Just kidding.

04:22.098 --> 04:23.652
You learn fast, grasshopper.

04:25.723 --> 04:28.519
Oh gosh, it's George.

04:29.796 --> 04:32.106
Who's George?

04:32.108 --> 04:33.385
Fifth graders.

04:35.871 --> 04:38.492
Still riding the bus, glasses?

04:38.494 --> 04:40.805
What do you want, George?

04:40.807 --> 04:42.531
Can't we just have small talk?

04:42.533 --> 04:44.187
Who's the new guy?

04:44.189 --> 04:45.568
I'm Theethil Thtevens.

04:45.570 --> 04:46.433
What?

04:47.503 --> 04:49.779
Thethil Thtevens?

04:49.781 --> 04:50.987
Hey I have bad hearing.

04:50.989 --> 04:52.955
Say that again in my good ear.

04:52.957 --> 04:53.820
Thethil.

04:56.754 --> 04:59.202
This is Thethil
Thevens ith it?

04:59.204 --> 05:00.790
What up weefle weefens?

05:00.792 --> 05:02.412
Tom Stupidface!

05:02.414 --> 05:04.794
Charlie, that doesn't work.

05:04.796 --> 05:05.795
Learn how to...

05:05.797 --> 05:07.797
Why don't you shut it?

05:07.799 --> 05:10.213
Whoah, whoah, not only
are these my brand new

05:10.215 --> 05:11.870
school clothes, but
tearing apart that bush

05:11.872 --> 05:13.596
is bad for the environment.

05:13.598 --> 05:15.218
Not to mention
the property value.

05:16.152 --> 05:18.256
Charlie, just get out of here.

05:18.258 --> 05:20.016
Later, glasses.

05:20.018 --> 05:22.607
Later purple shirt on a bike.

05:28.648 --> 05:30.717
If that run-in with
George of the jungle

05:30.719 --> 05:33.236
and his gorillas
is any indication,

05:33.238 --> 05:35.273
you need to work on
you coolness factor.

05:35.275 --> 05:37.206
It's a kid eat kid
world out there.

05:37.208 --> 05:40.519
Never sit in the
front of the bus.

05:40.521 --> 05:41.451
Why?

05:41.453 --> 05:42.418
Well the further up you sit,

05:42.420 --> 05:43.937
the less popular you are.

05:43.939 --> 05:47.043
The further back you
sit, the cooler you are.

05:47.045 --> 05:49.496
I sit all the way in row 13.

05:51.222 --> 05:53.567
You see that kid,
that's Chandler.

05:53.569 --> 05:55.155
He sat in the middle of the bus

05:55.157 --> 05:58.641
until one day, Zach shot
a spit wad in his ear.

05:59.575 --> 06:01.471
He couldn't hear for a week.

06:01.473 --> 06:03.819
The bell would ring and
he would just sit there.

06:03.821 --> 06:06.269
Everyone thought
it was hilarious.

06:06.271 --> 06:08.409
Now he sits in the front.

06:08.411 --> 06:10.308
Dang, who's Zach?

06:10.310 --> 06:11.654
Oh.

06:11.656 --> 06:15.211
I think his dad's a
professional boxer or something.

06:16.868 --> 06:19.075
Hey, he looks familiar.

06:19.077 --> 06:21.148
Hey, what's your name?

06:22.460 --> 06:27.292
Uh, I'm, I'm

06:28.466 --> 06:29.674
I'm having a good day.

06:30.675 --> 06:32.919
Okay, good for you.

06:34.334 --> 06:37.059
Listen Cecil, if you wanna
survive the fourth grade,

06:37.061 --> 06:38.992
you can't say your name.

06:38.994 --> 06:39.995
Until when?

06:41.686 --> 06:44.344
Forever.

06:48.520 --> 06:50.935
So you get to go to
your locker once a day

06:50.937 --> 06:55.976
unless you run full
speed there and back.

06:57.150 --> 06:58.252
Do not get caught in the
hall without a hall pass

06:58.254 --> 06:59.495
unless it's Mr. Finnegan.

06:59.497 --> 07:01.670
He'll let it slide
unless it's Fridays.

07:01.672 --> 07:03.292
He has to pick up
his kids on Fridays

07:03.294 --> 07:05.432
and sometimes he
gets a bit uptight.

07:05.434 --> 07:06.709
Oh, if you're late to school,

07:06.711 --> 07:07.952
it's not counted as
a tardy if you talk

07:07.954 --> 07:09.470
to Ms. Lewis in admin.

07:09.472 --> 07:11.024
Throw in a cough in
with your excuse,

07:11.026 --> 07:12.404
she'll let you slide every time.

07:12.406 --> 07:13.682
Her kid has asthma.

07:14.926 --> 07:17.202
Oh, never eat the
brownie surprise.

07:17.204 --> 07:19.411
Why, I like brownies.

07:19.413 --> 07:20.654
Uh-uh.

07:20.656 --> 07:22.483
You'll poop your pants
in 10 seconds flat.

07:23.901 --> 07:25.176
Trust me, they started
serving them late last year

07:25.178 --> 07:26.798
and the food's never
been the same since.

07:26.800 --> 07:28.317
The bathrooms either.

07:28.319 --> 07:30.010
So how do you know all this?

07:31.149 --> 07:33.494
I am the head writer
of the school newspaper.

07:33.496 --> 07:35.980
It's my job to know it all.

07:35.982 --> 07:37.188
Ab!

07:37.190 --> 07:39.638
I mean Miss Abby, big news.

07:39.640 --> 07:43.228
I can't believe,
changes, budgets.

07:43.230 --> 07:45.023
You're on record.

07:45.025 --> 07:46.507
They're making budget cuts.

07:46.509 --> 07:49.269
Cross country, math
club, debate team,

07:49.271 --> 07:52.964
even our mascot Little
Hercules, everything is gone!

07:53.827 --> 07:54.932
Newspaper?

07:56.554 --> 07:58.692
Is the newspaper gone?

07:58.694 --> 07:59.557
Not yet.

08:00.420 --> 08:01.902
So what's wrong?

08:01.904 --> 08:04.215
This paper, it's
our livelihood.

08:04.217 --> 08:06.769
Have you been living
under a rock or something?

08:06.771 --> 08:08.944
In the wake of
drastic budget cuts,

08:08.946 --> 08:11.601
only the cornerstone of
journalism can survive.

08:11.603 --> 08:14.950
But the question
is, for how long?

08:14.952 --> 08:17.368
So who are you?

08:19.370 --> 08:22.474
A boy man guy?

08:22.476 --> 08:25.063
He's new and he demands
his privacy, Martha.

08:25.065 --> 08:25.928
Let's go.

08:29.794 --> 08:31.483
Listen Cecil.

08:31.485 --> 08:33.727
This is the story
of the year, I mean.

08:33.729 --> 08:35.107
Even the mascot?

08:35.110 --> 08:36.799
And the question is why,

08:36.801 --> 08:39.525
it couldn't even
have saved that much.

08:39.528 --> 08:41.700
Just to imagine Little Hercules

08:41.702 --> 08:43.187
cast off at the pound.

08:44.326 --> 08:46.188
Hey new kid, I'm
Joel, what's up?

08:46.190 --> 08:47.292
Hey there, I'm...

08:47.294 --> 08:48.433
Leave him alone!

08:49.641 --> 08:51.057
Cecil, lay low.

08:52.783 --> 08:53.816
Okay.

08:53.818 --> 08:55.024
If anyone asks who you are,

08:55.026 --> 08:57.130
you say um,

08:57.132 --> 08:59.201
Say it with
a British accent.

08:59.203 --> 09:00.547
It'll mask the lisp.

09:00.549 --> 09:01.412
Okay.

09:02.585 --> 09:05.000
Ello there, I'm Cecil Stevens...

09:05.002 --> 09:06.277
No no no no, no.

09:06.279 --> 09:08.246
Uh, new plan.

09:09.627 --> 09:11.491
Don't say anything at all.

09:15.460 --> 09:16.323
Perfect.

09:29.923 --> 09:31.129

09:31.131 --> 09:34.928

13:16.356 --> 13:18.632
What did you hear?

13:18.634 --> 13:20.220
To the office.

13:20.222 --> 13:22.222
Get into the office.

13:22.224 --> 13:23.844
Get in the office!

13:23.846 --> 13:25.915
Principal Bloom!

13:25.917 --> 13:28.058
I see you've found our mute.

13:28.955 --> 13:29.818
Mute?

13:31.199 --> 13:32.957
Well let's keep it that way.

13:32.959 --> 13:35.063
Oh I don't think so.

13:35.065 --> 13:36.204
Come on, young man.

13:43.935 --> 13:46.246
Are you trying to
get yourself expelled?

13:46.248 --> 13:47.937
What did I tell you?

13:47.939 --> 13:49.422
Lay low.

13:49.424 --> 13:52.012
And did I saw lay low and
look in the principal's door?

13:53.083 --> 13:55.186
Maybe we can use
this whole mute thing

13:55.188 --> 13:56.498
to our advantage.

13:56.500 --> 13:58.569
My next newspaper
article is called

13:58.571 --> 14:00.018
"If You Could Be Anyone".

14:00.020 --> 14:01.434
So?

14:01.436 --> 14:04.437
So if you could be
anyone, who would you be?

14:04.439 --> 14:07.750
Uh, ninja turtle!

14:07.752 --> 14:09.235
Or a,

14:10.238 --> 14:11.170
power ranger!

14:13.482 --> 14:16.759
I was kinda thinking
someone who didn't talk.

14:16.761 --> 14:18.796
Like the Pink Panther.

14:20.903 --> 14:22.317
Uh, er.

14:22.319 --> 14:24.802
Basketball
tryouts, let's go.

14:24.804 --> 14:26.010
I don't know.

14:26.012 --> 14:28.564
I think I like
the ninja turtles.

14:28.566 --> 14:30.120
I'll see you after practice.

14:31.086 --> 14:32.016
Here?

14:32.018 --> 14:33.847
Peggy's picking me up too.

14:34.745 --> 14:36.262
I have the newspaper club.

14:36.264 --> 14:37.435
Cool.

14:37.437 --> 14:39.403
I love that newspaper.

14:39.405 --> 14:40.337
Thanks.

14:45.169 --> 14:47.309
Gentlemen, this is it.

14:48.414 --> 14:49.587
The day of reckoning.

14:50.968 --> 14:54.144
This is where we separate
the men from the boys.

14:55.697 --> 15:00.044
The Larry Birds from
the Harry Nerds.

15:00.046 --> 15:03.220
The Dennis Rodmans from
the Blemish Problems.

15:03.222 --> 15:06.156
The Kareem Abdul
Jabbars from the,

15:07.605 --> 15:09.226
well you get the picture.

15:10.505 --> 15:12.608
One or two of you punks
might play college ball.

15:12.610 --> 15:16.511
None of you will play in the
National Basketball League.

15:17.684 --> 15:19.822
But if you want
to be a contender,

15:19.824 --> 15:21.376
you gotta have your game.

15:21.378 --> 15:23.173
Dunk it baby, dunk it!

15:24.588 --> 15:28.210
Take it to the rim or take
your prepubescent butt home!

15:28.212 --> 15:31.558
Some of you will be cut today.

15:31.560 --> 15:34.423
But do not be deterred.

15:34.425 --> 15:36.356
Michael Jordan was actually cut.

15:36.358 --> 15:39.016
That's right, I'm
talking about MJ.

15:40.742 --> 15:41.605
On the line!

15:47.058 --> 15:47.885
You.

15:47.887 --> 15:48.819
Zach Jones.

15:49.889 --> 15:50.888
Made it!

15:50.890 --> 15:51.925
Woo, yeah!

15:55.481 --> 15:56.307
You.

15:56.309 --> 15:57.619
Stuart Spears.

15:57.621 --> 15:58.827
Cut!

15:58.829 --> 15:59.657
You.

16:00.451 --> 16:01.657
Max McCourty.

16:01.659 --> 16:04.800
Max
McCourty, made it!

16:05.732 --> 16:08.630
Yes!

16:08.632 --> 16:09.495
You, cut!

16:11.842 --> 16:12.705
You.

16:14.569 --> 16:15.432
Uh, I'm.

16:18.124 --> 16:18.987
I'm, I'm,

16:21.679 --> 16:24.406
I'm Michael Jordan!

16:33.312 --> 16:34.209
Woo!

16:35.555 --> 16:36.934
Jordan!

16:36.936 --> 16:38.627
Oh, he dunnked it!

16:39.835 --> 16:40.698
Woo!

16:41.941 --> 16:43.009
Hey wait, where'd he go?

16:43.011 --> 16:44.804
You the man, Mike.

16:44.806 --> 16:46.530
Yeah, that's what's up!

16:46.532 --> 16:48.048
MJ in the house!

16:48.050 --> 16:50.915
Hoping you show us some
of that in the game, MJ!

16:54.954 --> 16:57.543
Jiminy Christmas,
Cecil, you did what?

16:58.682 --> 17:01.096
Abby said, if I
could be anyone.

17:01.098 --> 17:02.028
But why do you
want to change it?

17:02.030 --> 17:03.547
It was your great Uncle Cecil's.

17:03.549 --> 17:05.790
He can't say his own name.

17:05.791 --> 17:08.792
It is social suicide.

17:08.795 --> 17:10.415
So you like my new name?

17:10.417 --> 17:12.314
Actually, I do.

17:12.316 --> 17:13.800
Nice to meet you, Mr. Jordan.

17:15.423 --> 17:16.800
Honey you can't
just say your name

17:16.803 --> 17:18.286
is something it's not.

17:18.288 --> 17:19.770
Really?

17:19.771 --> 17:22.462
Crap but, but Candace's
mom changes her last name

17:22.464 --> 17:23.396
all the time.

17:26.571 --> 17:29.089
You really want
to change your name?

17:29.091 --> 17:29.954
For good?

17:31.128 --> 17:33.164
'Cause I might know a
place where we can go.

17:36.754 --> 17:38.823
You can change your
name at the Horsey Orsey?

17:38.825 --> 17:39.652
Awesome!

17:39.654 --> 17:40.618
Oh yeah.

17:40.620 --> 17:43.174
This is name change central.

17:44.175 --> 17:45.589
You'll need this.

17:45.591 --> 17:46.521
Now better go stand in line,

17:46.523 --> 17:48.350
I'm gonna go talk to Sarah.

17:48.352 --> 17:50.870
Sometimes when Peggy
lets me help her at work

17:50.872 --> 17:53.217
and it's just me and her,

17:53.219 --> 17:56.013
we eat all the ice cream!

17:56.015 --> 17:56.878
Uh oh.

17:59.743 --> 18:02.401
Well, which one
of you is Cecil?

18:03.678 --> 18:05.678
You want to change
your name, honey?

18:05.680 --> 18:07.093
Yes.

18:07.095 --> 18:08.957
Right, well.

18:08.959 --> 18:12.512
If you would just write
the new name right here

18:12.514 --> 18:13.377
on this line.

18:22.731 --> 18:25.353
Okay, let me just
type this into my

18:25.355 --> 18:27.426
super secret supercomputer.

18:29.151 --> 18:31.497
For Pete's sake.

18:31.499 --> 18:32.946
Where did you
learn how to spell?

18:32.948 --> 18:35.155
And you can't put
numbers in your name.

18:35.157 --> 18:36.366
Aren't they precious?

18:40.370 --> 18:42.024
So school was crazy.

18:42.026 --> 18:44.753
I have a cool teacher who
loves the Magic Boxcar.

18:46.617 --> 18:47.547
This chicken's pretty good

18:47.549 --> 18:48.688
for something out of a box.

18:50.069 --> 18:52.276
You know, I thought we
were taking some time apart.

18:52.278 --> 18:54.209
It's his first day
of school, Lorrie.

18:54.211 --> 18:55.831
I wanted to be here for
you, you okay with that?

18:55.833 --> 18:57.350
You're confusing Cecil.

18:57.352 --> 18:58.524
Confused?

18:58.526 --> 18:59.352
Then you
are confusing your son.

18:59.354 --> 19:00.491
Confused?

19:00.493 --> 19:01.423
Confused, he's confused!

19:01.425 --> 19:04.428
I'm actually, Michael Jordan.

19:06.188 --> 19:07.118
What?

19:07.120 --> 19:09.086
See, your son is so confused.

19:09.088 --> 19:11.433
Great, here comes
the waterworks, great.

19:11.435 --> 19:13.230
You monster!

19:18.960 --> 19:21.754
Well, Michael.

19:21.756 --> 19:24.826
What do you say, you
thinking what I'm thinking?

19:24.828 --> 19:26.379
Oh yeah.

Where are
we going, Miss Baker?

20:11.357 --> 20:13.668
Inside your body!

20:13.670 --> 20:16.774
But if I'm here,
how can we go inside me?

20:16.776 --> 20:18.949
Science fiction!

20:18.951 --> 20:22.195
Let's fix this problem
so you can talk and sing.

20:23.956 --> 20:25.162
I know what he can sing.

20:25.164 --> 20:28.268
Cecil sold seashells
by the seashore.

20:28.270 --> 20:31.375
What, guys, no, no,
that's not my name.

20:31.377 --> 20:33.066
Cecil, Cecil.

20:33.068 --> 20:34.654
No, guys, guys!

20:34.656 --> 20:36.069
No, no, no guys!

20:36.071 --> 20:36.900
Guys!

20:38.039 --> 20:42.768
Cecil,
Cecil, Cecil, Cecil!

20:44.114 --> 20:47.287
Rodriguez, do not put
the bones in your mouth,

20:47.289 --> 20:48.530
that's disgusting.

20:48.532 --> 20:50.051
You're disgusting!

20:52.640 --> 20:54.467
You're so good with them.

20:54.469 --> 20:57.472
Well, it's all
about the discipline.

21:03.167 --> 21:05.892
Yo Mike, you need to
show me that hook shot later.

21:05.894 --> 21:06.826
Word up!

21:07.827 --> 21:08.690
Yo MJ.

21:18.458 --> 21:20.426
You just, that's Zach!

21:22.324 --> 21:24.462
This whole popularity thing
can really help us out.

21:24.464 --> 21:28.570
I mean sponsorships,
interviews, favors?

21:28.572 --> 21:29.916
We could own this school!

21:29.918 --> 21:32.850
That would cost like
a thousand dollars.

21:32.852 --> 21:35.061
Quiet, Martha,
it's an expression.

21:37.408 --> 21:40.271
Hey Michael, I never
got to introduce myself.

21:40.273 --> 21:41.134
I'm Chelsea.

21:41.136 --> 21:42.308
Oh hey.

21:42.310 --> 21:44.172
I'm Abby and this is Martha.

21:44.174 --> 21:45.691
She's the assistant and
I'm more of the head...

21:45.693 --> 21:48.212
Do you want to sit with
me at lunch today, Michael?

21:50.180 --> 21:51.904
Okay.

21:51.906 --> 21:53.148
Great, see you then.

21:55.530 --> 21:56.943
Bye.

21:56.945 --> 21:59.359
Holy moly, a Chelsea
Walters lunch date?

21:59.361 --> 22:01.120
She's a total betty.

22:01.122 --> 22:03.812
You get in with Chelsea
Walters, and Zach,

22:03.814 --> 22:07.369
and all three of us, we become
instantaneously popular.

22:08.785 --> 22:10.370
We've got some work to do.

22:10.372 --> 22:12.441
Cecil Stevens?

22:12.443 --> 22:15.652
Uh oh, move, we gotta move!

22:15.654 --> 22:17.483
Code Red, Martha
I said code red!

22:18.311 --> 22:19.658
Cecil Stevens?

22:21.901 --> 22:23.176
Cecil Stevens?

22:23.178 --> 22:25.247
I'll post up kids on
both sides of the slide.

22:25.249 --> 22:27.525
Cecil Stevens!

22:27.527 --> 22:28.667
Hey Miss Reichart.

22:31.566 --> 22:34.256
I think he went home sick today.

22:34.258 --> 22:35.121
What?

22:36.640 --> 22:37.503
Fine!

22:40.610 --> 22:41.919
Guys, what was that about?

22:41.921 --> 22:43.129
Cecil, let's go!

22:50.620 --> 22:53.586
Miss Baker, you are
looking smashing today.

22:53.588 --> 22:54.691
Has anyone told you that?

22:54.693 --> 22:56.244
Why thank you.

22:56.246 --> 22:58.971
And what can I do
for you today, Abby?

22:58.973 --> 23:01.561
Can't a classy lady
just talk to another

23:02.424 --> 23:04.116
kind of crazy lady?

23:05.220 --> 23:06.426
Well I guess.

23:06.428 --> 23:08.152
So basically my friend
has changed his name

23:08.154 --> 23:11.328
to Michael Jordan.

23:11.330 --> 23:12.881
What?

23:12.883 --> 23:14.920
Jordan, woohoo!

23:15.921 --> 23:16.851
Yeah.

23:16.853 --> 23:18.231
Anyways, a few teachers,

23:18.233 --> 23:20.061
and I'm not trying
to point any fingers.

23:20.063 --> 23:21.579
Reichart.

23:21.581 --> 23:24.686
Seem to still be calling
him by his old crappy name.

23:24.688 --> 23:26.308
I see.

23:26.310 --> 23:29.104
The problem is, that
all the official names

23:29.106 --> 23:32.590
are run through the
student computer database.

23:32.592 --> 23:35.248
And that is run through
the principal's office.

23:35.250 --> 23:37.457
So I'm afraid if that's
what your name is in there,

23:37.459 --> 23:39.289
that's what we have to call you.

23:41.325 --> 23:42.739
Thank you Miss Baker.

23:42.741 --> 23:44.085
You know I've really
been enjoying your class.

23:44.087 --> 23:45.053
Really?

23:46.503 --> 23:48.641
Thank you, 'cause I am so
excited to be teaching it.

23:48.643 --> 23:50.436
- Bye.
- Bye.

23:50.438 --> 23:52.576
Just when everything
was going great.

23:52.578 --> 23:54.026
We'll handle that later.

23:54.028 --> 23:56.306
We've got to get you
ready for your lunch date.

23:57.410 --> 23:59.721
Tell her she's a good writer.

23:59.723 --> 24:01.481
Good writer.

24:01.483 --> 24:03.863
Oh, and tell her that
she's a total betty.

24:03.865 --> 24:06.072
And not like an as if betty,

24:06.074 --> 24:07.729
like a girl next door betty.

24:07.731 --> 24:11.526
And make sure to tell
her you love Full House.

24:11.528 --> 24:12.354
Full House.

24:12.356 --> 24:13.219
Godspeed.

24:33.343 --> 24:36.102
You're such a good writer.

24:36.104 --> 24:37.241
What?

24:37.243 --> 24:40.106
Um, your writing is good?

24:40.108 --> 24:43.592
Okay, I don't
really like writing.

24:43.594 --> 24:45.010
I like magazines though.

24:49.669 --> 24:54.017
I think you're a betty
but not an as if betty,

24:54.019 --> 24:55.779
but more like girl
next door betty.

24:58.437 --> 25:01.438
I told you that my name's
Chelsea, not Betty.

25:01.440 --> 25:02.959
Oh yeah, of course.

25:16.351 --> 25:18.491
Do you like Full House?

25:19.561 --> 25:21.460
I love Full House!

25:22.875 --> 25:24.774
You totally remind me of Jessie.

25:25.809 --> 25:26.706
Booyah!

25:33.265 --> 25:35.265
You did great!

25:35.267 --> 25:36.093
Phenomenal!

25:36.095 --> 25:37.336
Quiet, Martha.

25:37.338 --> 25:39.027
Hey, we're gonna
go to our lockers.

25:39.029 --> 25:40.511
We'll catch up with you later.

25:40.513 --> 25:41.445
Copy that.

25:42.619 --> 25:43.618
I thought you said
we didn't have time

25:43.620 --> 25:45.068
to go to our locker.

25:45.070 --> 25:46.828
We're not going
to our lockers.

25:46.830 --> 25:48.692
We're going to the
principal's office.

25:48.694 --> 25:49.520
What?

25:49.522 --> 25:50.487
No way.

25:50.489 --> 25:53.317
You are so close, Cecil.

25:53.319 --> 25:56.838
The next time the speech
teacher walks into the classroom

25:56.840 --> 26:01.705
and calls your name, you'll
be done, kaput, finito!

26:01.707 --> 26:03.120
We've gotta do this.

26:03.122 --> 26:07.126
Hey, is that, someone's
ripping up the school newspaper!

26:10.750 --> 26:12.822
Please run the play!

26:14.271 --> 26:15.134
Oh, what?

26:16.515 --> 26:18.549
What, hey, break it up!

26:18.551 --> 26:20.139
I said break it up!

26:23.384 --> 26:25.351
Everybody up, bring
it in, bring it in!

26:27.802 --> 26:31.700
Gentlemen, you've
got to run the plays.

26:31.702 --> 26:33.116
Just like sometimes in life

26:33.118 --> 26:35.049
you've gotta do things
that you're not used to

26:35.051 --> 26:36.740
and you gotta do them well.

26:36.742 --> 26:40.123
Even though this thing
might be something

26:40.125 --> 26:42.401
that's considered
against the rules.

26:42.403 --> 26:44.644
Just put your faith in it

26:44.646 --> 26:46.025
and you do it.

26:46.027 --> 26:50.443
And you'll learn
that it's beautiful

26:50.445 --> 26:52.480
and it can change
your life forever!

26:52.482 --> 26:53.791
Yeah, let's get it on!

26:53.793 --> 26:55.000
Yeah!

26:55.002 --> 26:56.173
Whoa, yeah right.

26:56.175 --> 26:57.692
Yeah, let's go, let's go.

26:57.694 --> 26:59.040
B team up, B team up.

27:05.391 --> 27:07.324
Oh, what are we doing?!

27:10.327 --> 27:12.431
Article, and we
need somebody else

27:12.433 --> 27:14.573
to write another article.

27:23.064 --> 27:24.236
Uh huh?

27:24.238 --> 27:25.340
I'm in.

27:25.342 --> 27:26.272
Yes!

27:26.274 --> 27:27.655
Sorry guys, meeting's over.

27:33.005 --> 27:33.866
It's locked!

27:33.868 --> 27:35.661
I'm breaking in.

27:38.493 --> 27:40.047
Let's make this quick.

27:48.952 --> 27:51.401
So, we just need access
to the password database

27:51.403 --> 27:54.128
and then we should be
able to do the rest

27:54.130 --> 27:56.442
in any computer in the building.

27:57.581 --> 27:59.894
Ooh, Minesweeper,
let's play a game!

28:00.791 --> 28:01.654
Okay.

28:05.003 --> 28:05.900
Oh.

28:08.385 --> 28:09.626
Okay.

28:09.628 --> 28:10.868
So we just need to
bypass the mainframe

28:10.870 --> 28:14.081
and the password should
come up in no time.

28:22.296 --> 28:23.502
Hurry!

28:27.577 --> 28:29.786
We'll have to go, come on!

28:31.995 --> 28:32.925
Go, come on!

28:32.927 --> 28:35.516
ExtraStuffing is the password?

28:46.906 --> 28:48.805
Principal Bloom.

28:51.911 --> 28:53.741
Now Jimmy I,

28:55.846 --> 28:58.125
You told me a lot
of things, Bloom.

28:59.954 --> 29:01.438
I told you it takes time.

29:02.267 --> 29:05.164
It has to be casual.

29:05.166 --> 29:07.203
Just need a little time.

29:10.551 --> 29:12.654
Oh, look.

29:12.656 --> 29:14.831
This poor vermint.

29:17.385 --> 29:19.077
Did you give him time, Bloom?

29:23.046 --> 29:25.046
Stay serious!

29:25.048 --> 29:27.499
Shh, shh, what's that, huh?

29:28.327 --> 29:30.260
The money, Friday, hmm?

29:33.125 --> 29:34.333
It's
not gonna be enough.

29:35.403 --> 29:36.611
Not enough?

29:37.888 --> 29:40.027
Not enough time?

29:40.029 --> 29:41.994
Not enough time?

29:41.996 --> 29:44.065
No!

29:44.067 --> 29:44.964
No!

29:49.590 --> 29:51.003
Mr. Chomp Chomp!

29:54.491 --> 29:55.354
Friday.

29:56.666 --> 29:59.425
I'm a loan shark Bloom,
and you're swimming

29:59.427 --> 30:01.878
in deep waters with that
20,000 you borrowed.

30:03.017 --> 30:05.535
You pay me back or Mr.
Chippity Chomp Chomp

30:05.537 --> 30:06.743
Chip Chomp Chomp Chomp here

30:06.745 --> 30:08.954
won't be the only thing
that's chomping it.

30:12.716 --> 30:13.959
What did you buy, Bloom?

30:17.169 --> 30:20.103
I'll pay you back,
just leave us alone!

30:33.082 --> 30:34.186
We're gonna take care of this.

30:39.157 --> 30:40.846
Let's go home, little buddy.

30:40.848 --> 30:41.745
Let's go home.

30:42.919 --> 30:44.403
I'm gonna fix you.

30:52.031 --> 30:54.480
We've got to get out of here!

30:54.482 --> 30:58.831
Wait, it's, it's
worse than I thought.

30:59.901 --> 31:00.902
Let's go, come on!

31:07.150 --> 31:08.496
We've got to go!

31:12.535 --> 31:14.535
Hercules's favorite toy.

31:14.537 --> 31:16.675
Who cares about the mascot?

31:16.677 --> 31:17.574
Come on!

31:30.725 --> 31:32.380
Michael Jordan speaking.

31:32.382 --> 31:35.003
The newspaper canceled, why?

31:35.005 --> 31:36.800
This is major news, Michael.

31:38.147 --> 31:39.974
But there won't be any
newspaper to report it!

31:39.976 --> 31:43.011
The principal, he's
in some deep doodoo.

31:43.013 --> 31:44.979
And it stinks.

31:44.981 --> 31:46.636
From what I hear.

31:46.638 --> 31:49.225
Listen, it's obvious the
principal's stealing the funds

31:49.227 --> 31:51.779
but the question is, for what?

31:51.781 --> 31:54.299
Maybe he needs a new name.

31:54.301 --> 31:56.820
Not everyone needs a
new name like you, MJ.

31:57.683 --> 31:59.062
Except for Martha.

31:59.064 --> 32:01.375
And Paul Karkowski,
he needs a new one.

32:01.377 --> 32:03.722
Anyways, the security
of our school newspaper

32:03.724 --> 32:05.241
is at risk here.

32:05.243 --> 32:06.138
I've got it!

32:06.140 --> 32:08.071
What if we sold names?

32:08.073 --> 32:10.107
You're a genius, Michael.

32:10.109 --> 32:11.937
Not that genius.

32:11.939 --> 32:13.110
We can use the
principal's password

32:13.112 --> 32:14.664
to access the student database

32:14.666 --> 32:16.769
and sell everyone new names!

32:16.771 --> 32:17.943
I wanna be Kelly Kapowski.

32:17.945 --> 32:19.427
Sold.

32:19.429 --> 32:21.533
The money we make, we can
start our own newspaper!

32:21.535 --> 32:23.224
But I thought you
had to change it

32:23.226 --> 32:24.812
at the Horsey Orsey!

32:24.814 --> 32:27.573
I can transfer the names
when I go to work with Peggy.

32:27.575 --> 32:29.610

And Michael Jordan!

35:22.543 --> 35:23.406
What?

35:25.235 --> 35:27.065
I could have sworn I
canceled the newspaper.

35:28.480 --> 35:31.170
Someone else must
have paid for this.

35:31.172 --> 35:33.485
Who are you even talking to?

35:34.624 --> 35:36.728
Uh, no one, I just, uh,

35:36.730 --> 35:38.801
I'm just thinking out loud.

35:40.181 --> 35:41.044
Menacingly.

35:48.431 --> 35:51.432
So looks like we
have an Abby Jennings

35:51.434 --> 35:55.058
and a Cecil Stevens.

35:56.301 --> 35:58.130
You two sure have been busy.

35:59.062 --> 36:00.545
I was going to...

36:00.547 --> 36:03.722
Not only have you managed to
access my personal password,

36:04.827 --> 36:07.241
but I think you've
managed to start quite

36:07.243 --> 36:08.589
a little business venture.

36:09.832 --> 36:12.559
That's right, food
sales have been down.

36:14.181 --> 36:17.596
So, where's all the lunch money?

36:17.598 --> 36:18.873
I'm sorry!

36:18.875 --> 36:21.151
Ah, ah, ah, young
go-getters like you,

36:21.153 --> 36:22.431
you sure impress me.

36:24.122 --> 36:25.639
Punishment shouldn't
be the only answer

36:25.641 --> 36:27.261
to a problem like this.

36:27.263 --> 36:28.126
No.

36:29.817 --> 36:33.338
The way I see it, there's
no rules broken here.

36:37.238 --> 36:39.791
Long as we can come
up to an agreement.

36:39.793 --> 36:41.275
An agreement?

36:41.277 --> 36:46.316
I'll let you sell
names in my school

36:48.042 --> 36:50.182
and in return I'm thanked with

36:52.599 --> 36:54.046
80% of the profit.

36:54.048 --> 36:56.808
80%, that's ridiculous!

36:56.810 --> 36:59.398
You're ridiculous if you
think you have a choice!

37:00.261 --> 37:01.709
I'll give you so many detentions

37:01.711 --> 37:04.298
you'll think the breakfast
club is like daycare!

37:04.300 --> 37:06.818
80% and nothing less.

37:06.820 --> 37:10.891
Starting tomorrow, we're
gonna expand the business

37:10.893 --> 37:12.342
into the first grade,

37:13.309 --> 37:15.309
the second grade,

37:15.311 --> 37:16.862
the third grade,

37:16.864 --> 37:18.625
the whole school!

37:20.523 --> 37:22.594
Now get out there and
sell me some names!

37:23.940 --> 37:26.078
Listen, this meeting
of Name your Name

37:26.080 --> 37:29.150
has been called under
dire circumstances.

37:29.152 --> 37:30.531
I filled Martha in
on the way over.

37:30.533 --> 37:32.015
Question.

37:32.017 --> 37:35.087
I was under the impression that
we were gonna have popcorn.

37:35.089 --> 37:36.813
Get your head in the game!

37:36.815 --> 37:38.125
We'll have that later.

37:38.127 --> 37:38.953
Okay.

37:38.955 --> 37:40.403
So listen.

37:40.405 --> 37:42.129
We have no option but
to give Principal Bloom

37:42.131 --> 37:43.613
a cut of our money!

37:43.615 --> 37:46.340
But as long as our
business expands properly,

37:46.342 --> 37:48.894
we'll have plenty of money
to keep the newspaper going.

37:48.896 --> 37:51.552
So, if we follow
these instructions,

37:51.554 --> 37:54.417
the newspaper continues,
the principal stay happy

37:54.419 --> 37:56.592
and we'll, we stay cool.

37:56.594 --> 37:59.217
Like ice, Vanilla Ice.

38:00.563 --> 38:02.598
But guys, the principal.

38:02.600 --> 38:05.637
What if that Jimmy
guy comes for us?

38:07.674 --> 38:09.743
Stop scaring Martha!

38:09.745 --> 38:12.541
We just need to play ball
and keep the newspaper going.

38:13.472 --> 38:15.852
We haven't been this cool since,

38:15.854 --> 38:16.786
Never.

38:17.649 --> 38:20.167
We've been cool, Martha.

38:20.169 --> 38:22.551
We just, listen,

38:23.621 --> 38:25.172
I think I'm on to my next story.

38:25.174 --> 38:28.416
I think the principal did
something horrible to Hercules!

38:28.418 --> 38:31.180
No, our little pooch mascot!

38:32.008 --> 38:34.215
What, where'd you get that?

38:34.217 --> 38:38.599
Listen, we can't let the
principal know we're on to him.

38:38.601 --> 38:42.571
We can't tell a soul!

38:44.883 --> 38:46.575
Let's make some cheddar.

38:47.541 --> 38:48.713
Ching cha-ching!

38:48.715 --> 38:52.751
Cha-ching, cha-ching,
ching ching ching!

39:08.217 --> 39:11.287
Go Zach, go
Zach, go Zach, go Zach,

39:11.289 --> 39:14.257
go Zach, go Zach,
go Zach, go Zach.

39:18.641 --> 39:19.916
Ooh!

39:19.918 --> 39:23.955
Of course he's awesome,
he's Michael Jordan!

39:23.957 --> 39:25.577
I mean, if I was
Michael Jordan, right,

39:25.579 --> 39:27.098
I'd be all like slam!

39:28.755 --> 39:29.618
Right?

39:44.874 --> 39:48.084
We're
running out of names.

40:03.030 --> 40:04.376
I want that name.

40:05.930 --> 40:07.239
No way.

40:07.241 --> 40:10.141
Not even for 500 dollars?

40:11.418 --> 40:13.004
Uh.

40:13.006 --> 40:15.454
No way, I can't do it, nope.

40:15.456 --> 40:16.663
I'm Michael Jordan.

40:16.665 --> 40:19.355
But he's offering 500 bones!

40:19.357 --> 40:21.668
Our newspaper needs this.

40:21.670 --> 40:22.876
Yeah.

40:22.878 --> 40:24.015
Michael, walk
with me to class.

40:24.017 --> 40:26.017
Hey baby, one second.

40:26.019 --> 40:27.950
Hey baby?

40:27.952 --> 40:30.469
Listen, soon enough,
you'll be so popular

40:30.471 --> 40:31.678
that you won't even need...

40:31.680 --> 40:33.265
You're not selling
my name to Zach.

40:33.267 --> 40:35.440
Chelsea might break up with me.

40:35.442 --> 40:37.684
Yeah, but there are
plenty of other names.

40:37.686 --> 40:39.858
Sure, Chelsea likes
the name Michael

40:39.860 --> 40:42.792
but there are plenty
of other girls.

40:42.794 --> 40:44.069
Yeah, like Abby.

40:44.071 --> 40:44.900
Yeah, wait.

40:46.522 --> 40:47.763
Martha!

40:47.765 --> 40:51.320
Nothing, I mean,
I'm sorry Abby, ow.

40:52.286 --> 40:53.218
I can fix this!

40:55.220 --> 40:56.463
MJ, lets' go.

40:58.154 --> 40:59.913
I'm sorry Abby.

40:59.915 --> 41:00.743
I got to go.

41:05.610 --> 41:08.647
The samurai would
train and learn

41:09.787 --> 41:12.893
practicing the art of
extreme discipline.

41:14.343 --> 41:19.244
So when it was time for
them to go into battle, wah!

41:21.108 --> 41:22.454
They were ready.

41:29.772 --> 41:32.359
Hey, what are you doing?

41:32.361 --> 41:34.154
They heard that
Abby likes you.

41:34.156 --> 41:35.603
She is such a weirdo.

41:35.605 --> 41:37.433
And none of us really like her.

41:37.435 --> 41:38.779
She's no weirdo.

41:38.781 --> 41:40.781
Do you like her or something?

41:40.783 --> 41:42.231
Yes.

41:42.233 --> 41:43.715
I mean no.

41:43.717 --> 41:45.096
She's my friend.

41:55.004 --> 41:56.141
Oh!

41:56.143 --> 41:58.730
Most honorable Principal Bloom,

41:58.732 --> 42:00.249
how may we serve you?

42:00.251 --> 42:02.632
I need to see
Mr. Michael Jordan

42:03.772 --> 42:06.567
and Abby.

42:11.124 --> 42:14.504
Well, maybe you two
should just go out then.

42:14.506 --> 42:15.747
What, no.

42:15.749 --> 42:16.713
I'm...

42:16.715 --> 42:17.578
Now!

42:21.030 --> 42:22.685
Little Martha has so
kindly informed me

42:22.687 --> 42:27.000
that we have a 500 dollar offer
for the name Michael Jordan.

42:27.002 --> 42:29.830
But someone won't
give up the name!

42:29.832 --> 42:31.142
I can't.

42:31.144 --> 42:32.902
I'm Michael Jordan.

42:32.904 --> 42:33.903
No you're not.

42:33.905 --> 42:35.180
Yes I am.

42:35.182 --> 42:36.250
No you're not.

42:36.252 --> 42:37.251
Yes I am.

42:37.253 --> 42:38.080
Uh uh.

42:38.082 --> 42:38.908
- Uhuh.
- Uh-uh

42:38.910 --> 42:39.771
- Uhuh.
- Uh-uh!

42:41.154 --> 42:43.464
You can still be
popular with another name.

42:43.466 --> 42:45.294
Have you by
chance met Chandler?

42:45.296 --> 42:47.606
He was popular once.

42:47.608 --> 42:49.608
Until he crossed me.

42:49.610 --> 42:51.645
Who do you think got Zach
to shoot the spit wad

42:51.647 --> 42:52.957
in his ear, huh?

42:52.959 --> 42:53.958
What?

42:53.960 --> 42:54.821
You couldn't...

42:54.823 --> 42:55.787
Quiet, Martha!

42:55.789 --> 42:56.615
Now Cecil, give up the name

42:56.617 --> 42:57.444
or I'll run you forever.

42:57.446 --> 42:58.721
How's that sound?

42:58.723 --> 43:01.001
Give me my money!

43:16.361 --> 43:18.223
Oh, that slipped, that
slipped, time out, time out.

43:18.225 --> 43:19.569
Guys, let's get in
here, let's get in here.

43:19.571 --> 43:20.434
Come on, come on.

43:22.022 --> 43:24.747
Listen boys, you're not
playing the ball game

43:24.749 --> 43:26.783
you came here to play.

43:26.785 --> 43:28.475
You have to make a
decision when you get out

43:28.477 --> 43:29.752
on that court.

43:29.754 --> 43:33.273
Am I gonna be the winner
that takes this win?

43:33.275 --> 43:37.242
Am I ready to be the person
that I've always wanted to be?

43:37.244 --> 43:41.177
Or do you wanna sit around
like your old great aunt

43:41.179 --> 43:43.662
who can't really walk anymore,
who can't play the game,

43:43.664 --> 43:46.527
who has arthritis, who's
basically given up?

43:46.529 --> 43:48.877
Is that who you wanna be?

43:50.395 --> 43:54.156
Now get out there and show
these punks who you are!

43:54.158 --> 43:55.709
Who you came here to be!

43:55.711 --> 43:56.952
Get in here!

43:56.954 --> 43:59.301
One, two,
three, Mad Dogs!

44:00.474 --> 44:03.648
Bring it down and
give the ball to me.

44:03.650 --> 44:06.170
I'm not giving you anything!

44:37.580 --> 44:38.821
Thanks a lot.

44:38.823 --> 44:40.581
That's why I should
be Michael Jordan.

44:40.583 --> 44:41.515
You're a disgrace!

44:48.005 --> 44:49.245
Michael!

44:49.247 --> 44:50.384
We need to talk.

44:50.386 --> 44:51.661
I gotta go.

44:51.663 --> 44:53.318
Michael, I didn't
think Martha would!

44:53.320 --> 44:55.217
This would have never
happened if we didn't have

44:55.219 --> 44:57.771
to save your stupid newspaper!

44:57.773 --> 44:58.599
Stupid?

44:58.601 --> 45:00.638
Michael, I just wanted

45:02.709 --> 45:04.228
you to like me.

45:13.858 --> 45:15.099
Hey.

45:15.101 --> 45:16.548
How did it go?

45:16.550 --> 45:17.791
We lost.

45:17.793 --> 45:18.619
Lost?

45:18.621 --> 45:19.827
Well, that's okay.

45:19.829 --> 45:22.037
Boy's night out, we'll
have a good time.

45:22.039 --> 45:23.003
Where's mom?

45:23.005 --> 45:25.833
Oh, she is being so unfair.

45:25.835 --> 45:27.594
She acts like she's the
only one that raised you.

45:27.596 --> 45:28.767
Dad?

45:29.701 --> 45:30.631
There's this girl at school

45:30.633 --> 45:33.531
and I think I like her.

45:33.533 --> 45:35.015
What?

45:35.017 --> 45:37.224
Yeah Lorrie, remember I told
you about the game on the 15th.

45:37.226 --> 45:38.053
It's the 15th.

45:38.055 --> 45:40.089
The 15th, it's the 15th.

45:40.091 --> 45:42.022
Yeah, today is the 15th, yeah.

45:42.024 --> 45:43.472
No I'm not driving all
the way back there, no.

45:43.474 --> 45:45.163
We're going to go to a hotel.

45:45.165 --> 45:46.475
Mom.

45:46.477 --> 45:47.994
Sorry, Cecil.

45:47.996 --> 45:48.927
What?

45:50.308 --> 45:51.620
It's Michael.

45:52.759 --> 45:54.483
Yeah, you think
I'm happy about this?

45:54.485 --> 45:55.760
I'm not happy about
this either, Lorrie.

45:55.762 --> 45:56.554
You think that I'm happy
that I have to drive

45:56.556 --> 45:58.211
to come see my son?

45:58.213 --> 45:59.766
Hello mate, what's your name?

46:02.148 --> 46:03.321
Michael Jordan.

46:06.048 --> 46:08.290
So what's with the long face?

46:08.292 --> 46:10.671
Well don't tell anybody

46:10.673 --> 46:14.986
but my name wasn't
always Michael Jordan.

46:14.988 --> 46:16.505
Go on.

46:16.507 --> 46:19.234
My old name was
Thethil Thtevens.

46:20.442 --> 46:21.855
You sound like you're
talking with a mouth

46:21.857 --> 46:23.236
full of toffee.

46:23.238 --> 46:24.101
One more time.

46:24.929 --> 46:26.687
Thethil Thtevens.

46:26.689 --> 46:28.137
Anyways.

46:28.139 --> 46:31.106
This guy wants my
hard earned name

46:31.108 --> 46:33.936
but if I give it to him
I might lose this girl

46:33.938 --> 46:35.869
that I'm going out with.

46:35.871 --> 46:39.047
But if I don't, I might
lose everything else.

46:40.324 --> 46:41.566
I tell you what to do.

46:43.603 --> 46:45.465
Get a stinky sock.

46:45.467 --> 46:48.019
One that you've worn
for about three weeks,

46:48.021 --> 46:49.333
a really stinky sock.

46:50.299 --> 46:51.747
And you take it, right,

46:51.749 --> 46:52.748
and you stuff it...

46:52.750 --> 46:54.439
Did you say stinky sock?

46:54.441 --> 46:56.786
Kid, my advice to you is
to listen to an American.

46:56.788 --> 46:58.409
I've been here
for three years!

46:58.411 --> 47:00.618
Oh but he said
for three years!

47:00.620 --> 47:03.897
Every single night, it's
this way all the time.

47:03.899 --> 47:05.381
I speak English,
you're speaking English.

47:05.383 --> 47:07.659
At least I did, that's
what I'm doing here.

47:07.661 --> 47:10.317
You're the one who
don't even speak properly.

47:10.319 --> 47:11.939
I'm trying to
be a good father.

47:15.290 --> 47:17.290
Miss
Baker, where are we?

47:17.292 --> 47:18.808
Beats me.

47:18.810 --> 47:22.090
But let's try the
intestine expresstine!

47:23.436 --> 47:24.780
Vroom, vroom!

47:24.782 --> 47:27.196
Slow down!

47:27.198 --> 47:29.578
Looks like we got ourselves
into quite a pickle.

47:29.580 --> 47:31.476
Let's assess the damage.

47:31.478 --> 47:32.926
Looks like the
crash caused a leak

47:32.928 --> 47:34.859
in the oxygen tank, kids.

47:35.689 --> 47:37.206
Way to go Cecil.

47:37.208 --> 47:39.691
This is the worst
field trip ever.

47:39.693 --> 47:42.280
And I can make it
worse!

47:42.282 --> 47:45.076
I can make it much, much worse.

47:45.078 --> 47:47.561
Sell the name,
Cecil, sell the name!

47:47.563 --> 47:49.598
Give me my money!

47:49.600 --> 47:51.669
Sell the name

47:51.671 --> 47:53.466
and give me my money.

48:01.819 --> 48:05.926
I told you, one last
time, sell the name!

48:07.721 --> 48:09.240
Then you've sealed your fate!

48:10.517 --> 48:11.827
Wait.

48:11.829 --> 48:15.175
Actually his parents
legally changed his name

48:15.177 --> 48:19.835
to Michael Jordan and
if he sells the name

48:19.837 --> 48:22.217
then people might
come poking around

48:22.219 --> 48:25.220
and I think we both know that

48:25.222 --> 48:26.878
they won't like what they find.

48:29.226 --> 48:30.296
You're bluffing.

48:31.469 --> 48:33.299
Call his parents if
you don't believe me.

48:34.817 --> 48:35.646
Fine.

48:43.378 --> 48:45.550
Hello, this is Principal Bloom.

48:45.552 --> 48:46.482
Hello?

48:46.484 --> 48:48.622
Is Cecil's mother there?

48:48.624 --> 48:51.040
Oh you must be looking
for Michael's mother.

48:52.421 --> 48:54.180
Are you kidding me?

48:54.182 --> 48:56.527
Excuse me, who is this?

48:56.529 --> 48:58.253
Is this that bill collector?

48:58.255 --> 49:00.738
Because I can tell you exactly
where to put your bill.

49:04.192 --> 49:05.536
Do you think I'm joking?

49:05.538 --> 49:06.882
Just leave me alone.

49:06.884 --> 49:08.228
We need the money.

49:08.230 --> 49:10.679
You're selling the name.

49:10.681 --> 49:12.232
You can't make him!

49:12.234 --> 49:14.372
I can do whatever I want!

49:14.374 --> 49:15.513
I'm the principal.

49:16.514 --> 49:18.480
Now you, get out!

49:18.482 --> 49:20.758
Sit there one second
longer, young lady,

49:20.760 --> 49:23.761
and I'll ban newspapers
from this school forever!

49:23.763 --> 49:24.626
Get out!

49:29.424 --> 49:30.287
Now.

49:31.322 --> 49:32.461
Cecil Stevens.

49:33.876 --> 49:36.741
You think your name's gonna
save you from being unpopular?

49:37.604 --> 49:39.225
Well.

49:39.227 --> 49:44.024
Let me see if I can
sway your opinion.

49:50.203 --> 49:53.722
Hello, students of
Smith Elementary.

49:53.724 --> 49:58.313
Today, we're gonna have our
lead student Michael Jordan,

49:58.315 --> 50:01.247
read what we're
gonna have for lunch.

50:01.249 --> 50:04.769
Get ready, 'cause
it sounds delicious.

50:14.227 --> 50:15.090
Say it.

50:20.440 --> 50:21.924

50:23.478 --> 50:27.516

surprise for dessert.

51:07.004 --> 51:07.867
Fire!

51:11.767 --> 51:12.697
Hold your fire.

51:12.699 --> 51:14.596
Good one, guys.

51:14.598 --> 51:16.287
Steady your rifles.

51:16.289 --> 51:18.427
The target hasn't retreated yet.

51:18.429 --> 51:20.049
Guys, it's me.

51:20.051 --> 51:21.329
It's Michael.

51:30.752 --> 51:31.958
He's retreating!

51:31.960 --> 51:33.546
Victory is ours!

51:33.548 --> 51:34.411
What the?

51:36.378 --> 51:37.275
Shoot her!

51:44.248 --> 51:45.420
What are you doing?

51:45.422 --> 51:47.353
We'll never be cool again!

51:47.355 --> 51:48.354
What am I doing?

51:48.356 --> 51:49.598
I'm saving you!

51:51.635 --> 51:54.290
You still want these
idiots to like you?

51:54.292 --> 51:57.190
The back of the bus
can't be theirs forever.

52:14.174 --> 52:16.071
She likes you because you
were someone you weren't.

52:16.073 --> 52:19.456
It's a kid eat kid
world out there, Cecil.

52:22.044 --> 52:23.080
Ah, I'm hit.

52:24.737 --> 52:26.392
Aah.

52:26.394 --> 52:28.499
And if you wanna hang
out with them still,

52:30.018 --> 52:32.779
maybe you should just
leave me and Martha alone.

52:39.993 --> 52:41.476
I'm going out.

52:41.478 --> 52:42.410
Don't do it.

52:48.933 --> 52:49.762
No!

53:04.811 --> 53:07.055
Social suicide.

53:09.920 --> 53:12.955
You are not taking
him to some sleazy hotel, Tim.

53:12.957 --> 53:13.922
But where am I supposed
to take him, Lorrie?

53:13.924 --> 53:15.164
And for your information,

53:15.166 --> 53:16.511
the Lonely Heart Inn
happens to be a pillar

53:16.513 --> 53:17.719
of the community.

53:17.721 --> 53:19.134
Oh, now I've heard everything.

53:19.136 --> 53:20.515
No, he is staying here.

53:20.517 --> 53:21.343
He's coming with me.

53:21.345 --> 53:22.862
No, he is my son.

53:22.864 --> 53:25.105
What is he, the product
of immaculate conception?

53:25.107 --> 53:27.418
Okay fine, if you're gonna
act like that, take him!

53:27.420 --> 53:28.350
Take him!

53:28.352 --> 53:29.593
Go with your father, Cecil.

53:29.595 --> 53:30.456
No, I'm not falling
for your drama.

53:30.458 --> 53:31.942
No, no, you keep him.

53:32.977 --> 53:34.563
Stay with your mom.

53:34.565 --> 53:36.084
Go with your father, Cecil!

54:11.050 --> 54:14.154
Abby to MJ, I repeat,
Abby to MJ, over!

54:14.156 --> 54:16.158
This is MJ, over.

54:17.470 --> 54:19.265
I'm sorry, over.

54:20.128 --> 54:21.610
I'm sorry too.

54:21.612 --> 54:24.442
You're the only one who was
really being nice to me.

54:25.754 --> 54:28.306
Do you wanna help me
finish my last story, over.

54:28.308 --> 54:30.446
Duh, over.

54:30.448 --> 54:31.724
Then meet me outside
in five minutes.

54:31.726 --> 54:33.588
I've got a top
secret mission, over.

54:33.590 --> 54:36.142
What's the mission, over.

54:36.144 --> 54:39.939
The principal, the 20,000
dollars, our mascot Hercules,

54:39.941 --> 54:42.046
I'll fill you in
on the way, over.

54:45.256 --> 54:46.672
Were you finished, over.

54:47.845 --> 54:51.882
Yeah I said I'll fill
you in on the way, over.

54:51.884 --> 54:55.437
On the way over, over?

54:55.439 --> 54:58.166
Dang it, Michael, are you
up for the mission or not?

55:01.031 --> 55:02.271
Over.

55:02.273 --> 55:04.722
Yes, over and out!

55:43.763 --> 55:46.145
Are you sure you're ready?

55:51.391 --> 55:52.254
Hurry up!

55:57.881 --> 56:01.678
This should take us to
the ventilation system.

56:18.108 --> 56:19.972
Surprisingly spacious.

56:30.085 --> 56:31.500
Oh my gosh.

56:33.330 --> 56:38.369
He must have used the money
to start a taxidermy business!

56:40.889 --> 56:42.201
He's an animal!

56:43.202 --> 56:44.580
An animal stuffer!

56:44.582 --> 56:47.206
Oh my gosh,
is that Hercules?

56:48.897 --> 56:49.760
Shh!

57:02.980 --> 57:04.706
It's payback time.

57:08.399 --> 57:10.779
This one is two days old.

57:10.781 --> 57:13.023
It only takes one bite.

57:13.025 --> 57:16.614
And then,
you'll poop your pants.

57:27.695 --> 57:30.490
Jimmy, no, I'm
getting annoyed.

57:31.733 --> 57:33.666
It's okay, he's
just sleep talking.

57:44.677 --> 57:46.852
Oh ma, you made brownies.

57:55.412 --> 57:56.344
Sweet, pull up.

57:58.656 --> 57:59.485
Pull up!

58:01.763 --> 58:02.660
Pull up!

58:06.630 --> 58:07.493
Book it!

58:23.889 --> 58:27.476
I
hear you up there!

58:38.282 --> 58:39.316
Go, go, go, this way!

58:39.318 --> 58:41.251
No, this way!

58:58.199 --> 58:59.062
What?

59:00.373 --> 59:03.478
No, no of course I'm
not in the bathroom.

59:03.480 --> 59:05.551
I mean who talks on the
phone in the bathroom?

59:07.173 --> 59:09.691
Wait, I know, Tim, I know.

59:09.693 --> 59:11.660
Just tell Cecil I
said goodnight, okay?

59:12.558 --> 59:13.421
No.

59:14.284 --> 59:15.870
No, he is definitely with you.

59:15.872 --> 59:17.218
I told him to go with you.

59:18.115 --> 59:19.839
He's probably confused!

59:19.841 --> 59:21.360
Well, he probably is.

59:22.706 --> 59:24.292
Oh, Peggy!

59:38.135 --> 59:39.619
Michael!

59:50.630 --> 59:53.217
I might have expected
it from you, Abby.

59:53.219 --> 59:55.359
But Cecil and you two!

59:56.533 --> 59:57.877
I'm just glad you're okay.

59:57.879 --> 59:59.085
Me too.

59:59.087 --> 01:00:01.501
And don't think that
because you're not dead,

01:00:01.503 --> 01:00:02.744
that you're not in trouble.

01:00:02.746 --> 01:00:05.747
Oh my god, you could
have died, my baby!

01:00:05.749 --> 01:00:06.921
That's right.

01:00:06.923 --> 01:00:08.856
And whose fault
would that have been?

01:00:10.271 --> 01:00:12.236
I think a couple of people
need to go to their rooms

01:00:12.238 --> 01:00:13.893
and think about
what they've done.

01:00:13.895 --> 01:00:14.758
Yes.

01:00:17.450 --> 01:00:18.279
Nope.

01:00:21.489 --> 01:00:22.352
What?

01:00:23.491 --> 01:00:25.629
You two need to
think long and hard

01:00:25.631 --> 01:00:27.253
about your priorities.

01:00:40.991 --> 01:00:43.095
Some of you have neglected

01:00:43.097 --> 01:00:45.927
to give learning a chance.

01:00:47.135 --> 01:00:50.826
You would rather be cool
than study your school.

01:00:50.828 --> 01:00:52.900
But if you want to
reach the stars,

01:00:54.039 --> 01:00:56.694
you have to not care
what your friends think

01:00:56.696 --> 01:00:57.525
of your name.

01:01:02.426 --> 01:01:07.119
Foreign oxygen!

01:01:07.121 --> 01:01:08.225
Can't breath.

01:01:15.681 --> 01:01:19.719
Ah, Houston, we have a message
from a foreign lifeform.

01:01:21.652 --> 01:01:22.653
Play it cool.

01:01:24.241 --> 01:01:26.036
No, no, not you.

01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:29.624
Just him.

01:01:36.771 --> 01:01:37.979
Martha.

01:01:39.256 --> 01:01:40.119
Come in.

01:01:43.778 --> 01:01:44.742
It's done.

01:01:44.744 --> 01:01:47.400
You sold the name to Zach?

01:01:47.402 --> 01:01:49.195
How could you?

01:01:49.197 --> 01:01:51.096
He made me, he forced me.

01:01:52.097 --> 01:01:54.306
He also gave me lots of candy.

01:01:55.617 --> 01:01:56.618
You can leave now.

01:01:58.896 --> 01:02:01.138
Now Zach is the
new Michael Jordan,

01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:04.452
and well, that leaves
you.

01:02:04.454 --> 01:02:06.626
You'll sit in the
front of the bus

01:02:06.628 --> 01:02:08.559
and you'll hold your head low

01:02:08.561 --> 01:02:10.906
and it won't be that bad
unless you have to read

01:02:10.908 --> 01:02:13.979
the morning
announcements everyday.

01:02:13.981 --> 01:02:16.636
Or, yeah, or if
everyone figures out

01:02:16.638 --> 01:02:18.675
that you sold them false names.

01:02:19.917 --> 01:02:21.572
You see this money, this money,

01:02:21.574 --> 01:02:23.505
I'm betting it on
your game tonight.

01:02:23.507 --> 01:02:25.921
I'm betting that you're
gonna lose and I know that.

01:02:25.923 --> 01:02:28.027
And you know why I
know that, Cecil?

01:02:28.029 --> 01:02:31.030
I know that because you're
gonna make them lose

01:02:31.032 --> 01:02:35.759
or things are gonna get real,
real bad for you, Cecil.

01:02:35.761 --> 01:02:37.174
No.

01:02:37.176 --> 01:02:38.451
Lose the game, Cecil.

01:02:38.453 --> 01:02:40.453
And maybe, just maybe,

01:02:40.455 --> 01:02:42.285
I'll let you pick a new name.

01:02:43.665 --> 01:02:46.597
Heck, I'll even take you
to the Horsey Orsey myself!

01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:59.300
Why do you think mom
and dad named me Cecil?

01:02:59.302 --> 01:03:01.545
Because they
liked it, I suppose.

01:03:03.133 --> 01:03:04.443
What's there to like?

01:03:04.445 --> 01:03:06.928
You know, a lot of
really cool people

01:03:06.930 --> 01:03:08.171
have been named Cecil.

01:03:08.173 --> 01:03:09.310
Yeah, right.

01:03:09.312 --> 01:03:10.863
Like who?

01:03:10.865 --> 01:03:14.662
Well there was Cecil Cooper,
the all star baseball player.

01:03:16.284 --> 01:03:19.423
And Cecil B. Demille,
the famous filmmaker.

01:03:19.425 --> 01:03:24.465
And uh, Cecil Schwartzenegger,
the strongest man alive.

01:03:27.502 --> 01:03:28.365
Really?

01:03:29.263 --> 01:03:30.779
Yeah.

01:03:30.781 --> 01:03:32.574
I'm sure they didn't like
their names at first either.

01:03:32.576 --> 01:03:34.300
But they figured it out.

01:03:34.302 --> 01:03:36.787
I bet they can
pronounce their names.

01:03:40.205 --> 01:03:42.793
Oh, it looks like
you've got a visitor.

01:03:50.491 --> 01:03:51.354
Whoah.

01:03:57.774 --> 01:03:59.118
How did you know I was here?

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:00.602
Yeah, Peggy told me.

01:04:00.604 --> 01:04:02.604
I have to come work with her.

01:04:02.606 --> 01:04:04.123
Sounds like more of a vacation

01:04:04.125 --> 01:04:05.745
than a punishment to me though.

01:04:05.747 --> 01:04:06.852
Yeah, I guess.

01:04:08.612 --> 01:04:10.166
I wanna show you something.

01:04:20.659 --> 01:04:21.522
Whoah!

01:04:25.526 --> 01:04:27.008
Thanks!

01:04:27.010 --> 01:04:27.940
Peggy told me you might
need some cheering up.

01:04:27.942 --> 01:04:29.909
Mac and cheese, my favorite!

01:04:32.326 --> 01:04:33.189
Mmmm.

01:04:36.502 --> 01:04:37.365
Cecil?

01:04:40.265 --> 01:04:41.335
Do you know that

01:04:43.544 --> 01:04:47.856
besides Martha, you're
the only friend I've had

01:04:47.858 --> 01:04:50.031
since second grade?

01:04:50.033 --> 01:04:52.344
I used to be friends
with everybody

01:04:52.346 --> 01:04:57.213
until one day they all started
being really mean to Martha.

01:04:59.594 --> 01:05:01.974
I told her I would
always be her friend

01:05:01.976 --> 01:05:05.460
because I knew she
didn't have any.

01:05:05.462 --> 01:05:07.842
Then Chelsea and
Zach and everyone

01:05:07.844 --> 01:05:10.603
started calling me Glasses.

01:05:10.605 --> 01:05:15.125
But when I met
you, I didn't care

01:05:15.127 --> 01:05:16.611
if I had any other friends.

01:05:20.443 --> 01:05:21.306
Um.

01:05:22.962 --> 01:05:27.657
You know I was watching
Blossom earlier and,

01:05:28.727 --> 01:05:29.590
I was thinking,

01:05:32.765 --> 01:05:33.973
Holy crap!

01:05:41.084 --> 01:05:42.877
You're supposed
to close your eyes.

01:05:42.879 --> 01:05:43.742
Cool.

01:05:50.058 --> 01:05:51.196
Eww!

01:05:51.198 --> 01:05:52.404
Disgusting!

01:05:52.406 --> 01:05:53.957
Oh, it's all over me!

01:05:53.959 --> 01:05:55.165
Oh, that's disgusting!

01:05:55.167 --> 01:05:56.546
Oooh!

01:05:59.171 --> 01:06:01.277
Oh for Pete's sake,
it's not that bad!

01:06:03.210 --> 01:06:05.142
I guess it wasn't that bad.

01:06:06.247 --> 01:06:07.833
Yeah.

01:06:07.835 --> 01:06:10.422
Well have you
finished your story?

01:06:10.424 --> 01:06:11.940
Almost.

01:06:11.942 --> 01:06:14.391
It might be my last
but it will definitely

01:06:14.393 --> 01:06:15.498
be a page turner.

01:06:16.292 --> 01:06:17.810
And make us popular?

01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:20.468
Maybe, maybe not.

01:06:48.531 --> 01:06:50.945
Oh kids,
chances of us making it out

01:06:50.947 --> 01:06:52.878
of this field trip are slim.

01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:56.157
The oxygen tank is almost spent.

01:06:56.159 --> 01:06:58.679
This is all Cecil's fault!

01:06:59.438 --> 01:07:00.299
Oh man!

01:07:00.301 --> 01:07:01.749
I've got it!

01:07:01.751 --> 01:07:04.579
If Cecil learns to say
the right mouth movement,

01:07:04.581 --> 01:07:07.479
then the wind will
propel us out in a jiffy!

01:07:07.481 --> 01:07:10.654
I sure hope it doesn't
have any S sounds in it.

01:07:10.656 --> 01:07:15.314
He just has to
say his true name.

01:07:17.076 --> 01:07:18.768
Uh, Michael Jordan?

01:07:19.872 --> 01:07:21.874
I know your
name's not Michael.

01:07:25.361 --> 01:07:27.015
Hurry, Cecil.

01:07:27.017 --> 01:07:28.053
Just say it.

01:07:29.123 --> 01:07:32.849
Please.

01:07:32.851 --> 01:07:34.715
No, I can't.

01:07:35.923 --> 01:07:37.062
Hurry, Cecil.

01:07:43.068 --> 01:07:45.862
Some
of you have neglected

01:07:45.864 --> 01:07:49.314
to give learning a chance.

01:07:49.316 --> 01:07:53.456
The samurai would
train and learn.

01:07:53.458 --> 01:07:57.324
So when it was time for
them to go into battle,

01:07:58.186 --> 01:07:59.049
they were ready.

01:08:03.191 --> 01:08:04.674
Thecil.

01:08:04.676 --> 01:08:06.572
Just like sometimes
in life you gotta do things

01:08:06.574 --> 01:08:08.367
that you're not used to
and you gotta do them well.

01:08:08.369 --> 01:08:11.853
You'll learn that
it's beautiful and,

01:08:11.855 --> 01:08:13.372
The-cil.

01:08:13.374 --> 01:08:16.305
It can change
your life forever.

01:08:16.308 --> 01:08:17.171
Thecil!

01:08:20.761 --> 01:08:21.624
Thecil!

01:08:25.455 --> 01:08:26.353
Thecil!

01:08:28.769 --> 01:08:29.631
Thecil!

01:08:40.263 --> 01:08:41.469
You better be right, Bloom,

01:08:41.470 --> 01:08:43.022
or you're getting
a knuckle sandwich.

01:08:43.024 --> 01:08:44.162
Extra knuckles.

01:08:45.924 --> 01:08:48.959
He loses this game,
you double your money

01:08:48.961 --> 01:08:50.340
and we're square.

01:08:50.341 --> 01:08:51.205
You're slipping,
Bloom, you're slipping.

01:09:06.254 --> 01:09:08.703
What are we doing?

01:09:08.705 --> 01:09:09.568
Oh!

01:09:11.536 --> 01:09:13.018
Time out!

01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:13.883
Everybody in.

01:09:21.062 --> 01:09:24.411
Look boys, sometimes you
come to the end of a rope.

01:09:25.756 --> 01:09:28.309
Begin to realize that
things maybe aren't exactly

01:09:28.310 --> 01:09:29.795
what you thought they were.

01:09:35.214 --> 01:09:36.904
But guess what?

01:09:36.906 --> 01:09:38.283
We gotta put that behind us.

01:09:38.286 --> 01:09:39.665
We gotta get over it.

01:09:39.667 --> 01:09:41.943
There are plenty of
ropes in the sea!

01:09:41.944 --> 01:09:43.876
And when you find one
of those new ropes,

01:09:43.877 --> 01:09:45.636
do you know what you have to do?

01:09:45.639 --> 01:09:47.604
You have to dunk
the crap out of it.

01:09:49.158 --> 01:09:50.261
Michael.

01:09:50.264 --> 01:09:51.332
Yeah?

01:09:51.334 --> 01:09:52.988
No, no wait, Michael.

01:09:52.991 --> 01:09:53.817
I'm Michael.

01:09:53.819 --> 01:09:54.749
My name is Michael.

01:09:54.751 --> 01:09:55.647
I bought it fair and square.

01:09:55.649 --> 01:09:57.200
Cut the crap, Zach.

01:09:57.202 --> 01:09:59.202
MJ, you got this.

01:09:59.204 --> 01:10:00.859
You know what to do.

01:10:00.861 --> 01:10:04.345
I talked about it every
single day in practice.

01:10:04.347 --> 01:10:07.106
I'm no Michael
Jordan, I can't.

01:10:07.108 --> 01:10:09.868
Hey, don't be
like my sick aunt.

01:10:09.870 --> 01:10:12.457
Just get out there and do
it, we've got your back.

01:10:12.459 --> 01:10:13.563
No matter who you are.

01:10:15.496 --> 01:10:17.496
One, two, three!

01:10:17.498 --> 01:10:18.395
Mad Dogs!

01:10:29.096 --> 01:10:30.546
We gotta go, we gotta go.

01:10:49.496 --> 01:10:50.564
Yes!

01:10:51.808 --> 01:10:53.221
That's my son!

01:10:53.223 --> 01:10:54.501
That's my baby!

01:11:02.474 --> 01:11:03.715
That's it, Bloom.

01:11:03.717 --> 01:11:04.543
You're coming with me!

01:11:04.545 --> 01:11:05.855
No, no, no.

01:11:05.857 --> 01:11:07.132
Bloom, Bloom!

01:11:07.134 --> 01:11:08.547
Baby Bloom!

01:11:08.549 --> 01:11:09.999
Woo, MJ!

01:11:16.868 --> 01:11:18.315
That's enough!

01:11:18.317 --> 01:11:20.561
Sit down, sit down!

01:11:23.253 --> 01:11:24.979
You're gonna pay, Cecil.

01:11:27.257 --> 01:11:30.086
Our star player has
something to say.

01:11:30.088 --> 01:11:31.846
He and his little girlfriend,

01:11:31.848 --> 01:11:34.884
they hacked into the
school computer system.

01:11:34.886 --> 01:11:37.265
You all have the
same names you did

01:11:37.267 --> 01:11:40.234
at the beginning
of the school year.

01:11:40.236 --> 01:11:41.407
What, no!

01:11:41.409 --> 01:11:45.273
No, Michael Jordan
would not do that to us.

01:11:45.275 --> 01:11:48.175
No, I'm Michael,
not that chump!

01:11:49.659 --> 01:11:51.210
I'm confused.

01:11:51.212 --> 01:11:52.006
Tell everyone.

01:11:57.598 --> 01:11:58.530
Look guys.

01:11:59.635 --> 01:12:02.741
The names we sold all of
you, they aren't real.

01:12:03.742 --> 01:12:04.881
They don't count.

01:12:06.434 --> 01:12:07.297
And?

01:12:08.471 --> 01:12:11.023
I was forced to
sell you all names

01:12:11.025 --> 01:12:15.754
by that man, Jimmy McCracken.

01:12:16.928 --> 01:12:18.272
I can't believe it!

01:12:18.274 --> 01:12:20.069
Guard, arrest him.

01:12:21.898 --> 01:12:23.311
Okay.

01:12:23.313 --> 01:12:24.452
But you're coming too.

01:12:29.078 --> 01:12:30.215
Easy, champ.

01:12:30.217 --> 01:12:31.354
He made me do it!

01:12:31.356 --> 01:12:33.908
He owes me 20 large!

01:12:36.810 --> 01:12:38.605
Oh I got this.

01:12:42.539 --> 01:12:44.056
Boom!

01:12:44.058 --> 01:12:44.921
Yes!

01:12:47.544 --> 01:12:49.406
My hero.

01:12:49.408 --> 01:12:51.029
- Great job, Dallas.
- Thanks.

01:12:51.031 --> 01:12:52.133
I'm her brother, John.

01:12:52.135 --> 01:12:53.203
Brother?

01:12:53.205 --> 01:12:54.584
Oh.

01:12:54.586 --> 01:12:55.896
Hey!

01:12:55.898 --> 01:12:56.726
Okay.

01:12:58.555 --> 01:13:00.625
Hercules, Hercules!

01:13:00.627 --> 01:13:02.765
Hercules, I
thought you'd been stuffed!

01:13:02.767 --> 01:13:05.595
Nope, I found him in
the principal's house.

01:13:05.597 --> 01:13:07.459
He was just about to stuff him.

01:13:07.461 --> 01:13:09.703
He would have made
a better table piece.

01:13:09.705 --> 01:13:11.638
That mutt deserves
to be stuffed!

01:13:14.088 --> 01:13:15.434
How's that for stuffing?

01:13:25.237 --> 01:13:26.064
Yeah.

01:13:26.066 --> 01:13:26.929
Yeah, good.

01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:32.346
Okay, truce.

01:13:32.348 --> 01:13:33.174
For now.

01:13:33.176 --> 01:13:34.039
Well clearly.

01:13:38.699 --> 01:13:42.045
Dude, if we could, I'd totally
let you be Michael Jordan.

01:13:42.047 --> 01:13:43.944
He doesn't need to
be Michael Jordan.

01:13:43.946 --> 01:13:45.531
He's already cool

01:13:45.533 --> 01:13:47.154
because we're going out.

01:13:47.156 --> 01:13:50.053
Er, wrong, he's
not your boyfriend

01:13:50.055 --> 01:13:51.917
and he's cool in general.

01:13:51.919 --> 01:13:52.953
As if.

01:13:52.955 --> 01:13:54.126
Quiet, Chelsea.

01:13:54.128 --> 01:13:54.991
Burn!

01:13:57.304 --> 01:13:59.996
Oooh.

01:14:03.448 --> 01:14:04.930
Look guys.

01:14:04.932 --> 01:14:06.794
I think we all need
to stop worrying

01:14:06.796 --> 01:14:08.660
about being cooler
than each other.

01:14:10.075 --> 01:14:12.043
I think we're all
a little weird.

01:14:13.147 --> 01:14:15.805
But I also think we're
all a little cool.

01:14:28.024 --> 01:14:30.162
Bravo.

01:14:30.164 --> 01:14:31.062
Oh, oh Jimmy.

01:14:32.546 --> 01:14:33.892
Wait for me.

01:14:36.930 --> 01:14:37.758
Oh.

01:14:39.553 --> 01:14:41.242
This meeting of Smith
Elementary News team

01:14:41.244 --> 01:14:42.383
has been called under,

01:14:43.764 --> 01:14:45.317
I couldn't wait.

01:14:47.941 --> 01:14:49.423
Do you guys know
what a newsteam does

01:14:49.425 --> 01:14:51.770
after they finish
covering a big story?

01:14:51.772 --> 01:14:52.771
Celebrate!

01:14:52.773 --> 01:14:54.186
Eat popcorn!

01:14:54.188 --> 01:14:55.015
Laser tag!

01:14:55.017 --> 01:14:56.499
We move on.

01:14:56.501 --> 01:14:58.501
We've got standards
here, people.

01:14:58.503 --> 01:15:00.123
Now it's time for
our next story.

01:15:00.125 --> 01:15:03.851
How about Hercules the
mascot escapes slavery?

01:15:03.853 --> 01:15:05.094
Cures cancer!

01:15:05.096 --> 01:15:07.717
How about boy
plays video games

01:15:07.719 --> 01:15:10.202
for 40 hours straight?

01:15:10.204 --> 01:15:12.722
How about stuff that's
actually happening?

01:15:12.724 --> 01:15:14.172
Haven't you ever wondered why

01:15:14.174 --> 01:15:16.312
our speech teacher,
the one in charge

01:15:16.314 --> 01:15:18.693
of helping us talk better,

01:15:18.695 --> 01:15:20.109
has an English accent?

01:15:20.111 --> 01:15:21.869
Oh I guess I
never thought of it.

01:15:21.871 --> 01:15:23.629
Me either.

01:15:23.631 --> 01:15:26.184
I think we all
noticed Miss Reichart

01:15:26.186 --> 01:15:28.427
getting fresh with
Jimmy at the game.

01:15:28.429 --> 01:15:30.602
And it turns out,
they've been in cahoots

01:15:30.604 --> 01:15:31.845
this whole time.

01:15:31.847 --> 01:15:33.639
The whole staff knew
that Principal Bloom

01:15:33.641 --> 01:15:37.057
was gonna get fired and next
in the seniority line was her.

01:15:37.059 --> 01:15:40.854
But what about Miss
Baker and Coach Dallas?

01:15:40.856 --> 01:15:42.269
That's the worst part.

01:15:42.271 --> 01:15:43.753
They seem to be the only two

01:15:43.755 --> 01:15:45.237
who aren't in on it.

01:15:45.239 --> 01:15:48.275
Which means they're
gonna get rid of them.

01:15:48.277 --> 01:15:49.586
They're gonna kill them?

01:15:49.588 --> 01:15:52.417
No, they're gonna
get them both fired.

01:15:52.419 --> 01:15:55.454
And then they'll have nothing
standing in their way.

01:15:55.456 --> 01:15:59.046
Our school, our newspaper,
it will all be done for.

01:16:00.392 --> 01:16:02.254
Unless...

01:16:02.256 --> 01:16:04.532
I don't like
where this is going.

01:16:04.534 --> 01:16:05.844
I do.

01:16:05.846 --> 01:16:07.123
Unless what?

01:16:08.090 --> 01:16:10.573
Unless we stop them.

01:16:10.575 --> 01:16:11.783
All of them?

01:16:16.098 --> 01:16:18.134
We're gonna need
a bigger brownie.

01:16:21.588 --> 01:16:26.588
Subtitles by explosiveskull

01:16:29.214 --> 01:16:30.284
No.

01:16:33.529 --> 01:16:37.634
This is senior writer
Abby Jennings

01:16:37.636 --> 01:16:39.050
signing out.

01:16:39.052 --> 01:16:43.019
Goodnight and good luck.
