(tires screech)

00:08.675 --> 00:10.969
D'oh!

00:11.052 --> 00:13.013
-Aah!
-(tires screech)

00:13.096 --> 00:14.597
Huh?

00:28.194 --> 00:30.363
(whistling)

00:35.326 --> 00:36.745
Good morning, sir.

00:36.828 --> 00:38.246
Care for some coffee?

00:38.329 --> 00:40.040
No, the promise
of a new day

00:40.123 --> 00:42.792
is more than enough
exhilaration for me.

00:45.086 --> 00:46.421
(clock ticks)

00:49.924 --> 00:51.551
(snoring)

00:52.969 --> 00:54.387
Smithers?

00:54.471 --> 00:56.222
Coffee.

00:56.306 --> 00:57.557
Ah!

00:57.640 --> 00:59.601
We need some excitement
around here.

00:59.684 --> 01:01.269
Chinese checkers
or domestic, sir?

01:01.352 --> 01:03.313
No, no, something fun--

01:03.396 --> 01:06.149
Something the men will enjoy,
like a safety drill.

01:06.232 --> 01:07.650
But what kind?

01:07.734 --> 01:10.153
Eh, meltdown alert?
Mad dog drill?

01:10.236 --> 01:11.613
Blimp attack?

01:11.696 --> 01:15.283
Ah, I think a good old-fashioned
fire drill today.

01:15.366 --> 01:16.493
(alarm blares)

01:17.994 --> 01:19.412
All right,
popcorn's ready.

01:19.496 --> 01:20.663
(alarm continues)

01:20.747 --> 01:25.085
Hey,
that's the fire alarm.

01:25.168 --> 01:27.087
We got to get
out of here.

01:27.170 --> 01:28.797
Wait for me.

01:28.880 --> 01:30.423
Come on, come on,
come on!

01:30.507 --> 01:31.758
Look out!

01:33.176 --> 01:34.636
Get out of my way!

01:35.970 --> 01:37.722
(fretting)

01:40.683 --> 01:41.810
Huh.

01:41.893 --> 01:43.228
Mmm.

01:45.271 --> 01:47.649
Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!
Fire! Fire!

01:49.400 --> 01:51.778
Is it supposed
to take this long?

01:51.861 --> 01:53.071
What's a good time

01:53.154 --> 01:55.281
for a mass evacuation
of the entire plant?

01:55.365 --> 01:57.200
45 seconds.

01:57.283 --> 01:58.618
And what's our time so far?

01:58.701 --> 02:00.078
I don't know, sir.

02:00.161 --> 02:01.913
This stopwatch only
goes up to 15 minutes.

02:01.996 --> 02:03.581
Damnation.

02:03.665 --> 02:05.375
What kind of slow coaches
do I have working for me?

02:05.458 --> 02:08.670
Ah, here comes
one of our fellows now.

02:12.215 --> 02:13.883
I think I won,
Mr. Burns.

02:13.967 --> 02:17.095
Yes, you won,
all right.

02:17.178 --> 02:19.889
You won more
than you bargained for.

02:19.973 --> 02:20.890
Whoo-hoo!

02:20.974 --> 02:23.017
What a disgraceful display.

02:23.101 --> 02:26.312
I've seen more orderly behavior
in a Ritz brothers film.

02:26.396 --> 02:28.565
You all need
a serious lesson in teamwork.

02:28.648 --> 02:30.567
Maybe he does,
but I don't.

02:30.650 --> 02:32.110
Hey,
you take that back.

02:32.193 --> 02:33.736
No, you take
that back.

02:33.820 --> 02:35.738
Yeah! Yeah!

02:35.822 --> 02:38.199
Hit him, Carl!
You, too, Lenny!

02:38.283 --> 02:40.243
(groans)

02:40.326 --> 02:42.162
So Burns is going
to make us all

02:42.245 --> 02:44.122
go on a stupid
corporate retreat

02:44.205 --> 02:46.499
up in the mountains
to learn about teamwork,

02:46.583 --> 02:48.459
which means we'll have
to cancel our plans

02:48.543 --> 02:49.544
to hang around here.

02:49.627 --> 02:52.172
-Teamwork is overrated.
-Huh?

02:52.255 --> 02:56.134
Think about it. I mean,
what team was Babe Ruth on?

02:56.217 --> 02:58.094
-Who knows?
-ALL: Yankees.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.054
Sharing is a
bunch of bull, too.

03:00.138 --> 03:01.055
And helping others.

03:01.139 --> 03:02.432
And what's all this crap

03:02.515 --> 03:03.933
I've been hearing
about tolerance?

03:04.017 --> 03:06.186
Hmm. Your ideas
are intriguing to me,

03:06.269 --> 03:08.563
and I wish to subscribe
to your newsletter.

03:08.646 --> 03:10.648
But I think we have to go
on the retreat anyway.

03:36.007 --> 03:37.175
Well, here we are.

03:38.301 --> 03:39.844
All right,
let me start off

03:39.928 --> 03:42.597
by telling you this will not
be a walk in the park.

03:42.680 --> 03:44.015
This will be
the most arduous

03:44.098 --> 03:45.934
and backbreaking
weekend of your life.

03:46.017 --> 03:49.312
I cannot overemphasize
the dangers which...

03:49.395 --> 03:51.439
Did you bring your family,
Simpson?

03:51.522 --> 03:54.359
Yes, sir.
I thought I was supposed to.

03:54.442 --> 03:56.236
Ah, imbecile.

03:56.319 --> 03:58.780
Simpson, your family
will have to remain here.

03:58.863 --> 04:00.156
-Aw, man.
-Aw...

04:00.240 --> 04:01.866
Don't worry, kids.
This is a national park.

04:01.950 --> 04:03.660
We can have lots of fun.

04:03.743 --> 04:06.287
Oh, I'm afraid that's
no longer true, ma'am.

04:06.371 --> 04:08.373
Budget cutbacks
have forced us

04:08.456 --> 04:11.584
to eliminate anything
the least bit entertaining.

04:14.545 --> 04:16.673
Well, uh, see you.

04:18.549 --> 04:21.427
Each two-man team will work
its way through the wilderness

04:21.511 --> 04:24.347
to a cabin hidden somewhere
on this mountain.

04:24.430 --> 04:27.392
The routes are treacherous,
so use your maps.

04:27.475 --> 04:28.893
I lost my map.

04:28.977 --> 04:31.104
You haven't been
issued a map yet.

04:31.187 --> 04:32.438
When you arrive
at the cabin,

04:32.522 --> 04:34.190
there will be
a congratulatory party

04:34.274 --> 04:37.026
with sandwiches and
moderately-priced champagne.

04:37.110 --> 04:40.405
(applause)

04:40.488 --> 04:41.990
Now, as an added incentive,

04:42.073 --> 04:44.242
the second to last team
to arrive at the cabin

04:44.325 --> 04:46.452
will receive
an hilarious

04:46.536 --> 04:48.454
"World's Worst
Employee" Trophy.

04:48.538 --> 04:50.248
Hey, this sounds
like fun.

04:50.331 --> 04:52.750
And the last team
to arrive will be fired.

04:52.834 --> 04:54.294
(chuckles)
Uh-oh.

04:54.377 --> 04:56.337
And to show that
I'm not playing favorites,

04:56.421 --> 04:58.756
both Smithers and I
will be participating.

04:58.840 --> 05:02.135
Who knows? I might be
the unlucky one who gets fired.

05:02.218 --> 05:03.594
(to himself)
Not bloody likely.

05:03.678 --> 05:06.472
I've placed all your
names in this hat.

05:06.556 --> 05:07.890
-Ooh!
-Thank you.

05:07.974 --> 05:10.310
Now, pair off
as I draw your names.

05:10.393 --> 05:13.146
Lenny and... Carl.

05:13.229 --> 05:16.482
Aw, nuts.
I mean, um...

05:16.566 --> 05:17.650
Aw, nuts.

05:17.734 --> 05:20.903
Fong and... Zutroy.

05:20.987 --> 05:24.365
Kimball and... Dawson.

05:24.449 --> 05:27.493
Haney and... Drucker.

05:27.577 --> 05:31.289
Simpson and... Burns?

05:31.372 --> 05:32.749
(groans)

05:32.832 --> 05:34.751
HOMER'S BRAIN:
<i>Quiet, you fool.</i>

05:34.834 --> 05:37.295
<i>You're on the one team</i>
<i>that can't possibly be fired.</i>

05:37.378 --> 05:38.296
Oh.

05:38.379 --> 05:40.048
Sir, this can't be right.

05:40.131 --> 05:41.507
You assured me
this drawing was rigged

05:41.591 --> 05:42.508
so we'd be teammates.

05:42.592 --> 05:44.344
Yes, well, frankly,

05:44.427 --> 05:45.928
you've been
bit of a pill lately.

05:46.012 --> 05:49.349
Why do we always
fight on vacation?

05:49.432 --> 05:51.309
Now, there's only
one name left.

05:51.392 --> 05:53.519
Whoever it is
will be paired with me.

05:53.603 --> 05:55.188
And that person is...

05:55.271 --> 05:56.481
Waylon Smithers.

05:56.564 --> 05:58.274
Perfect.
That's just perfect.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.526
Prepare for the
adventure of a lifetime

06:00.610 --> 06:02.070
as you fight for survival

06:02.153 --> 06:04.447
against the merciless
forces of nature.

06:04.530 --> 06:06.074
Toe your marks...

06:06.157 --> 06:07.867
Get set...

06:07.950 --> 06:09.327
Go!

06:12.413 --> 06:14.123
Ready, Mr. Burns?

06:15.249 --> 06:17.293
One moment.

06:32.433 --> 06:35.436
<i>Only who can prevent</i>
<i>forest fires?</i>

06:35.520 --> 06:39.107
<i>You pressed "You,"</i>
<i>referring to me.</i>

06:39.190 --> 06:42.944
<i>That is incorrect.</i>
<i>The correct answer is you.</i>

06:43.027 --> 06:44.445
(snarls)

06:44.529 --> 06:45.863
Mom, can Lisa and I
play outside

06:45.947 --> 06:47.281
away from the bear?

06:47.365 --> 06:49.826
Okay, but when you start
getting apple-cheeked,

06:49.909 --> 06:51.369
it's time to come in.

07:00.378 --> 07:02.588
How could you do this
to me, Mr. Burns?

07:02.672 --> 07:04.215
After all
I've done for you.

07:04.298 --> 07:05.967
Why, if you were here,

07:06.050 --> 07:08.219
I'd kick you right
in your bony old behind!

07:08.302 --> 07:13.641
<i>(echoing)</i>
<i>Bony old behind!</i>

07:13.724 --> 07:15.059
Why, thank you, Simpson.

07:15.143 --> 07:17.103
I have been
watching my figure.

07:17.186 --> 07:18.980
(cackles)

07:19.063 --> 07:20.481
Lise, Lise, come here.

07:20.565 --> 07:22.817
I found two snowflakes
that are exactly alike.

07:22.900 --> 07:24.777
LISA: Really?
Let me see.

07:24.861 --> 07:26.821
(evil chuckle)

07:28.489 --> 07:29.365
SMITHERS: Ow!

07:30.908 --> 07:32.118
Oops. Sorry.

07:32.201 --> 07:33.494
Hi, Mr. Smithers.

07:33.578 --> 07:36.414
Oh, great.
It's the Bobbsey twins.

07:36.497 --> 07:38.291
Well, take your
prying eyes elsewhere.

07:38.374 --> 07:40.376
Oh, I'm sorry.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.128
It hasn't been
a good day.

07:42.211 --> 07:44.213
If I don't get to the top
of the mountain real soon,

07:44.297 --> 07:46.382
-I could get fired.
-We'll help you.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.842
I have a watch
with a minute hand.

07:47.925 --> 07:50.344
All right,
you can come.

07:50.428 --> 07:51.345
What time is it?

07:51.429 --> 07:53.014
12:80.

07:53.097 --> 07:54.432
No, wait.

07:54.515 --> 07:56.476
Wait.
What comes after 12?

07:56.559 --> 07:57.518
One.

07:57.602 --> 07:58.603
No, after 12.

07:58.686 --> 07:59.687
Ohh...

07:59.770 --> 08:02.148
Tell me, Simpson,

08:02.231 --> 08:05.943
if an opportunity arose
for taking a small shortcut,

08:06.027 --> 08:08.488
you wouldn't be averse
to taking it, would you?

08:08.571 --> 08:10.281
Um, not as such.

08:10.364 --> 08:12.033
Neither would I.

08:12.116 --> 08:13.743
I've always felt that
there's far too much

08:13.826 --> 08:16.454
hysteria these days
about so-called cheating.

08:16.537 --> 08:19.373
-Yes, a lot of hysteria.
-Mm-hmm.

08:19.457 --> 08:21.918
If you can take advantage
of a situation in some way,

08:22.001 --> 08:23.503
it's your duty
as an American to do it.

08:23.586 --> 08:25.505
Why should the race
always be to the swift

08:25.588 --> 08:27.465
or the jumble
to the quick-witted?

08:27.548 --> 08:30.551
Should they win merely because
of the gifts God gave them?

08:30.635 --> 08:34.263
Well, I say cheating is
the gift man gives himself.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.516
Mr. Burns, I insist
that we cheat.

08:36.599 --> 08:37.934
Excellent.

08:38.017 --> 08:41.771
And to do so,
I propose we travel by...

08:41.854 --> 08:43.523
horseless sleigh.

08:43.606 --> 08:46.651
Wow. You sure know
how to cheat, Mr. Burns.

08:46.734 --> 08:48.653
Yes, well,
I'm older than you.

08:48.736 --> 08:51.614
You know, Simpson
you're not as objectionable

08:51.697 --> 08:52.782
as you seemed
when we first met.

08:52.865 --> 08:54.492
No, sir, I am not.

08:57.453 --> 08:58.829
(motor revving)

09:03.292 --> 09:04.585
Bart?

09:04.669 --> 09:06.379
Lisa?

09:08.256 --> 09:10.383
Hello?

09:10.466 --> 09:12.426
(projector whirrs)

09:12.510 --> 09:16.639
NARRATOR: <i>The story of our</i>
<i>national parks begins in 1872.</i>

09:16.722 --> 09:19.725
<i>Perhaps we should let John Muir</i>
<i>tell the tale.</i>

09:19.809 --> 09:22.144
MUIR:
<i>Oh, yeah. I remember...</i>

09:22.228 --> 09:26.315
<i>(incoherent mumbling)</i>

09:31.654 --> 09:33.239
Excuse me, sir.

09:33.322 --> 09:34.740
I can't find my children.

09:34.824 --> 09:36.200
Have you checked the woods?

09:36.284 --> 09:38.995
-No.
-Hmm.

09:39.078 --> 09:40.329
Follow me.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.497
We'll take
the chair lift.

09:41.581 --> 09:42.999
It'll give us
an eagle-eye view

09:43.082 --> 09:45.167
of the area directly
beneath the chair lift.

09:47.003 --> 09:48.629
Whoo!

09:48.713 --> 09:50.172
Well, I won't lie
to you, ma'am.

09:50.256 --> 09:51.424
Our chances of finding
your children

09:51.507 --> 09:52.466
are slim to nil.

09:52.550 --> 09:54.385
LISA:
Hi, Mom.

09:54.468 --> 09:55.928
MARGE:
There they are!

09:56.012 --> 09:57.763
Let me down here.

09:57.847 --> 09:59.682
Sorry. There's no way off
till we get to the top.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.309
And even then,
it's sort of tricky.

10:01.392 --> 10:03.144
(grumbles)

10:03.227 --> 10:05.479
All right, kids,
we'll meet you at the top!

10:05.563 --> 10:07.273
Just be careful!

10:07.356 --> 10:09.483
Uh, actually, I'm a little
more concerned about us.

10:09.567 --> 10:10.985
(creaking)

10:11.068 --> 10:12.153
Um, do you know
how to weld?

10:16.657 --> 10:20.578
That worked so well.

10:20.661 --> 10:22.288
We have several hours
before the others arrive.

10:22.371 --> 10:24.498
What say we get comfy?

10:24.582 --> 10:26.417
Now we have electricity.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.419
This propane tank
will supply us with heat.

10:30.087 --> 10:32.089
And this doorknob,
properly turned,

10:32.173 --> 10:34.300
will allow us
access to the cabin.

10:35.718 --> 10:38.220
No going through
the window for us.

10:38.304 --> 10:40.431
BART: Is there maple syrup
in this one?

10:40.514 --> 10:42.683
SMITHERS: There isn't any food
in any of these trees.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.268
Please, Bart,
we've got to hurry.

10:44.352 --> 10:46.020
I can't be the last one
to reach the cabin.

10:46.103 --> 10:48.230
Hey, I'm not going
to get fired.

10:48.314 --> 10:49.690
Is there any gold
in this mountain?

10:49.774 --> 10:52.068
(sputtering)
It doesn't matter.

10:52.151 --> 10:54.570
I'll check.

10:54.654 --> 10:57.073
Mr. Smithers!
Mr. Smithers!

10:57.156 --> 10:58.616
I found another
hurt shrew.

10:58.699 --> 11:01.369
I think this one
has a twisted ankle.

11:01.452 --> 11:02.912
Twisted ank...

11:02.995 --> 11:05.206
Aren't there any
healthy animals in this forest?

11:05.289 --> 11:07.458
Well, I don't suppose
the others will mind us

11:07.541 --> 11:09.835
starting the party early,
Homie, old boy.

11:09.919 --> 11:11.379
More champagne?

11:11.462 --> 11:12.630
(chuckles)

11:12.713 --> 11:14.090
You know, Mr. Burns,

11:14.173 --> 11:16.217
you're the richest guy
I know.

11:16.300 --> 11:17.843
Way richer than Lenny.

11:17.927 --> 11:22.014
Oh, yes, but I'd trade it
all for a little more.

11:22.098 --> 11:24.225
Oh, these sure are
comfortable chairs.

11:24.308 --> 11:26.894
Oh, yes, sitting.
The great leveler.

11:26.977 --> 11:29.855
From the mightiest pharaoh
to the lowliest peasant,

11:29.939 --> 11:32.149
who doesn't
enjoy a good sit?

11:32.233 --> 11:35.277
Oh, man,
you are so right.

11:35.361 --> 11:36.904
Did you ever
sit like this?

11:36.987 --> 11:38.656
Yes, yes,
that's it.

11:38.739 --> 11:41.325
Oh, I could go
for one of those right now.

11:41.409 --> 11:44.495
Ahh!

11:44.578 --> 11:48.541
The only hard part
is getting up.

11:48.624 --> 11:49.542
(chuckles)

11:49.625 --> 11:51.293
Why get up?

11:51.377 --> 11:53.796
Here's a little move
I've been tinkering with.

11:53.879 --> 11:55.840
Say I want
that bowl of dip.

11:55.923 --> 11:57.925
Why, you'd
have to get up.

11:58.008 --> 11:59.218
Oh?

11:59.301 --> 12:01.846
(grunting)

12:05.224 --> 12:08.644
Sir, I am in your debt.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.730
Use it wisely,
my friend.

12:10.813 --> 12:13.566
(tinkling)

12:13.649 --> 12:15.651
(rumbling)

12:15.735 --> 12:16.861
Ah! Oh!

12:21.115 --> 12:23.868
Hey, did you
hear something?

12:23.951 --> 12:25.703
-No.
-Hmm. Did I?

12:25.786 --> 12:26.662
I don't know.

12:28.372 --> 12:29.915
Hope that wasn't
an avalanche.

12:29.999 --> 12:31.459
Be a chum
and take a look-see.

12:31.542 --> 12:32.877
You got it, buddy.

12:37.673 --> 12:38.758
Oh!

12:45.931 --> 12:48.768
Isn't there any way
out of here?

12:48.851 --> 12:50.936
I don't see one.
Unless...

12:55.566 --> 12:56.859
No, there's no way out.

12:56.942 --> 12:58.360
There must be
some way

12:58.444 --> 13:00.279
to contact
the outside world.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.950
Ah, the telegraph.

13:06.076 --> 13:09.288
S.O.S.

13:09.371 --> 13:11.248
Avalanche...

13:11.332 --> 13:12.917
Send...

13:13.000 --> 13:14.668
Help.

13:14.752 --> 13:15.878
(beeping)

13:15.961 --> 13:17.630
(beeping)

13:30.768 --> 13:33.479
According to the map,
the cabin should be right here.

13:33.562 --> 13:35.231
(grunting)

13:35.314 --> 13:37.900
Hey, maybe
there is no cabin.

13:37.983 --> 13:40.736
Maybe it's one of them
metaphorical things.

13:40.820 --> 13:43.364
Oh, yeah, yeah...
like maybe the cabin

13:43.447 --> 13:45.741
is the place
inside each of us

13:45.825 --> 13:47.952
created by our goodwill
and teamwork.

13:48.035 --> 13:49.370
Oh.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.957
Uh, they said
there would be sandwiches.

14:03.050 --> 14:05.010
Simpson,
I have a confession.

14:05.094 --> 14:06.762
I'm not quite
the tunnel-digger

14:06.846 --> 14:08.055
I made myself out to be.

14:08.138 --> 14:09.473
You can supervise me.

14:09.557 --> 14:11.267
All right, good.
Let's dig.

14:11.350 --> 14:13.060
That's right.
Dig some more.

14:13.143 --> 14:16.063
Oh, we make quite a duo--
Burns and associate.

14:16.146 --> 14:17.648
No, no,
what am I thinking?

14:17.731 --> 14:19.358
Burns and teammate.

14:21.026 --> 14:22.820
(both gasping)

14:29.702 --> 14:31.245
We made it,
old friend.

14:31.328 --> 14:32.830
We sure did.

14:32.913 --> 14:35.040
-Huzzah!
-Whoo-hoo!

14:35.124 --> 14:36.876
(rumbling)

14:36.959 --> 14:39.420
(screaming)

14:42.172 --> 14:43.674
D'oh!

14:50.389 --> 14:51.473
What happened?

14:51.557 --> 14:53.517
(rumbling)

14:53.601 --> 14:54.685
I think when we yelled

14:54.768 --> 14:56.478
we caused
another avalanche.

14:58.814 --> 15:03.235
(quietly and slowly)
We... should... be... careful

15:03.319 --> 15:05.738
not... to... speak...

15:05.821 --> 15:11.869
unless... it's...
absolutely...

15:11.952 --> 15:15.372
pos-i-tively...

15:15.456 --> 15:16.999
necessary.

15:17.082 --> 15:19.251
(rumbling)

15:19.335 --> 15:20.377
Shh.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.881
You're... causing

15:23.964 --> 15:26.342
more... avalanches.

15:26.425 --> 15:28.385
(rumbling)

15:28.469 --> 15:30.095
-I...
-(rumbling)

15:30.179 --> 15:31.889
-Think...
-(rumbling)

15:31.972 --> 15:35.100
-They've... stopped.
-(rumbling)

15:36.977 --> 15:38.145
Let's go.

15:48.030 --> 15:49.448
(door creaks)

15:50.574 --> 15:52.201
Oh!

15:52.284 --> 15:54.954
Those last three avalanches
were your fault, Simpson.

15:55.037 --> 15:56.288
So what?

15:56.372 --> 15:57.665
Sew buttons.

16:01.919 --> 16:03.587
There's not another
place for miles.

16:03.671 --> 16:05.506
This must be the cabin
Burns was talking about.

16:08.008 --> 16:09.885
Well, we made it
here first.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.553
All thanks
to teamwork.

16:11.637 --> 16:12.972
Yeah, my teamwork.

16:13.055 --> 16:16.225
We must be covered
by a thousand feet of snow.

16:16.308 --> 16:18.268
It could be days
before they find us.

16:18.352 --> 16:22.690
Mmm, no books, no radio
no board games.

16:22.773 --> 16:24.733
Ah!
A "Bazooka Joe" Comic!

16:24.817 --> 16:27.861
Ugh, I heard that one
75 years ago!

16:27.945 --> 16:30.489
We could build
snowmen.

16:30.572 --> 16:32.574
No, I have
a better idea.

16:32.658 --> 16:35.744
We could build real men
out of snow.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.705
Oh.

16:37.788 --> 16:39.123
Okay...

16:39.206 --> 16:41.417
(shivering)

16:45.963 --> 16:47.756
Ah!

16:47.840 --> 16:51.051
Mr. Smithers, Mr. Smithers!
That moose is on fire!

16:51.135 --> 16:53.095
Fine. Good.
I don't care anymore.

16:53.178 --> 16:55.681
I'm the last one here.
You kids cost me my job.

16:55.764 --> 16:57.725
You ain't last,
Mr. Smithers.

16:57.808 --> 16:59.601
Ah, thank goodness.

16:59.685 --> 17:01.603
Yeah, Burnsie and Homer
never made it.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.564
Mr. Burns is still
out there?

17:03.647 --> 17:05.899
(gasps)
What about our dad?!

17:05.983 --> 17:08.777
Ah, 206 bones,

17:08.861 --> 17:10.988
50 miles of
small intestine,

17:11.071 --> 17:12.948
full pouting lips.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.034
Why, this fellow
is less a snowman

17:15.117 --> 17:16.201
than a god.

17:17.661 --> 17:19.621
Well, we've managed
to stave off

17:19.705 --> 17:21.582
cabin fever
for a few hours.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.754
Eh, I think we should
dress the snowmen.

17:26.837 --> 17:27.963
Agreed.

17:31.467 --> 17:32.801
Look at them.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.596
Smug and secure
in their finery.

17:35.679 --> 17:36.972
Mocking us.

17:37.056 --> 17:39.016
Uh, they're just
snowmen, Mr. Burns.

17:39.099 --> 17:41.310
Ah, snowmen
have peepers.

17:41.393 --> 17:42.936
Peepers to watch...

17:43.020 --> 17:44.605
To watch for a moment
of weakness and, baff!

17:44.688 --> 17:46.607
Comes the knock on the head
and we're down!

17:46.690 --> 17:47.775
What do we do?!

17:47.858 --> 17:50.319
Oh, wouldn't you
like to know.

17:54.740 --> 17:57.493
Hey, what is going on here?
Who are you people?

17:57.576 --> 18:00.370
This is a lookout post.
Where is ranger McFadden?

18:00.454 --> 18:02.581
(slurred)
I was just happy

18:02.664 --> 18:04.708
to see so many
nice people.

18:04.792 --> 18:07.086
Quiet, you drunk.
Where is ranger McFadden?

18:07.169 --> 18:08.921
Right here, sir.
Right behind the drunk.

18:09.004 --> 18:10.422
Wait a minute.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.216
If this is
a ranger station

18:12.299 --> 18:13.675
we must be
in the wrong place.

18:13.759 --> 18:16.345
Well, the only other
cabin is right over...

18:16.428 --> 18:18.514
There...

18:18.597 --> 18:19.515
Huh.

18:19.598 --> 18:20.891
(whistles)

18:20.974 --> 18:22.434
Look at all
these avalanches.

18:22.518 --> 18:24.019
Do you think they could
have buried the cabin?

18:24.103 --> 18:25.646
I'll tell you
one thing:

18:25.729 --> 18:28.273
They didn't come here for
the mountain music festival.

18:28.357 --> 18:29.900
March 14th to 18th.

18:29.983 --> 18:32.694
Mom, Dad and Mr. Burns
could be trapped in there.

18:32.778 --> 18:33.654
(gasps)

18:37.074 --> 18:39.660
<i>BURNS:</i>
<i>I'm trapped with a madman.</i>

18:45.374 --> 18:47.793
<i>Look at him.</i>
<i>Staring into me.</i>

18:47.876 --> 18:50.295
<i>Filling my mind</i>
<i>with paranoid thoughts.</i>

18:50.379 --> 18:52.506
<i>HOMER:</i>
<i>Mmm. Look at his eyes.</i>

18:52.589 --> 18:54.550
<i>He's trying to hypnotize me</i>

18:54.633 --> 18:56.927
<i>but not in the good</i>
<i>Las Vegas way.</i>

18:57.010 --> 18:58.303
BURNS: <i>(gasps)</i>
<i>I know what he's up to.</i>

18:58.387 --> 19:00.931
<i>He's thinking of killing me</i>

19:01.014 --> 19:03.851
<i>then riding my carcass</i>
<i>down the mountain to safety.</i>

19:03.934 --> 19:07.479
<i>He's truly gone mad</i>
<i>if he's thinking that.</i>

19:07.563 --> 19:10.816
<i>Well, he can't kill me</i>
<i>if I kill him first.</i>

19:10.899 --> 19:11.900
I'll kill you

19:11.984 --> 19:13.485
you bloated museum
of treachery!

19:13.569 --> 19:14.653
You and what army?

19:17.990 --> 19:18.907
(gasps)

19:18.991 --> 19:20.159
Stay back.

19:20.242 --> 19:22.578
I have powers.

19:22.661 --> 19:23.704
Political powers!

19:27.082 --> 19:28.000
(gasps)

19:28.083 --> 19:30.502
It's... showtime!

19:35.174 --> 19:36.884
(grunting)

19:36.967 --> 19:38.135
Gimme!
Let go of that!

19:45.309 --> 19:47.436
Oh, God...

19:47.519 --> 19:49.563
(grunts)

19:49.646 --> 19:51.148
Ah!

19:51.231 --> 19:52.441
(rumbling)

19:52.524 --> 19:53.817
Homer!

19:53.901 --> 19:55.068
Burnsie!

19:57.821 --> 19:59.698
(both screaming)

19:59.781 --> 20:01.575
Okay, search party,
before we set out

20:01.658 --> 20:04.328
let's take a moment
to humor the children.

20:04.411 --> 20:06.955
Kids, your father is
going to be just fine.

20:08.415 --> 20:09.416
Okay, everybody
put on your

20:09.499 --> 20:10.667
corpse-handling gloves.

20:10.751 --> 20:11.960
We've got two
frozen bodies

20:12.044 --> 20:13.545
buried somewhere
in this mountain.

20:13.629 --> 20:14.796
Did you hear that, Lise?

20:14.880 --> 20:17.257
Dad's going
to be just fine.

20:17.341 --> 20:18.383
(rumbling)

20:18.467 --> 20:19.718
Look! What's that?!

20:24.848 --> 20:26.058
We'll be dashed to pieces!

20:26.141 --> 20:27.601
Oh, Lord, protect
this rockethouse

20:27.684 --> 20:29.770
and all who dwell
within the rockethouse.

20:29.853 --> 20:31.063
It's them, all right.

20:31.146 --> 20:32.940
We're over here, Homie!

20:33.023 --> 20:34.942
Oh, something's wrong
with its brakes!

20:35.025 --> 20:36.526
Gangway!

20:45.744 --> 20:47.579
(door creaks)

20:50.749 --> 20:51.792
Marge, kids.

20:51.875 --> 20:53.794
(all clamoring)

20:55.045 --> 20:56.588
(Burns clearing throat)

20:56.672 --> 20:58.632
Have you people forgotten
our little competition?

20:58.715 --> 21:00.509
Last one
in the cabin is fired!

21:00.592 --> 21:02.052
(clamoring)

21:05.222 --> 21:06.723
You're fired, Lenny.

21:06.807 --> 21:07.933
Aw, nuts!

21:09.184 --> 21:10.811
So, how did we do?

21:10.894 --> 21:12.396
It's a new record, sir.

21:12.479 --> 21:13.772
Outstanding.

21:13.855 --> 21:16.316
Well, perhaps all of this
has been worthwhile.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.819
Did you all learn
about teamwork?

21:18.902 --> 21:20.153
ALL: (weakly) Yes.

21:20.237 --> 21:21.697
Excellent!

21:21.780 --> 21:22.739
In that case

21:22.823 --> 21:24.992
no one will be
fired after all.
