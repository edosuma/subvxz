18:58.041 --> 18:58.958
How?

18:59.041 --> 19:00.541
I would have calmed her down.

19:00.625 --> 19:01.541
-Hmm?
-Mm.

19:03.083 --> 19:06.666
It was about time.
Rose does not know how to control herself.

19:06.750 --> 19:07.708
How?

19:07.791 --> 19:10.208
And Salako has been
letting her get away with it?

19:10.291 --> 19:11.291
-That's it.
-How?

19:11.375 --> 19:13.000
We should pray for her.

19:13.083 --> 19:16.125
Pray for who?
Everybody knows she's Salako's girlfriend.

19:16.208 --> 19:18.000
-Ah, is that new?
-[clears throat]

19:18.875 --> 19:21.125
Ah, Tolani, how are you?

19:22.333 --> 19:24.500
-Have you heard?
-Heard what?

19:24.583 --> 19:26.000
Don't bear false witness.

19:26.083 --> 19:28.708
Face your food, pastor.
Who is talking to you?

19:28.791 --> 19:32.833
It's Rose's concern
and no one else's. [tsk]

19:32.916 --> 19:34.875
Just be talking anyhow.

19:34.958 --> 19:37.333
Me, I like her, I'm just concerned.

19:41.750 --> 19:44.875
[relaxing music playing on speakers]

19:46.625 --> 19:48.041
Mm.

19:50.125 --> 19:52.125
Who else was there apart from Ignatius?

19:52.208 --> 19:56.500
Um, Godwin. But he was all right.

19:58.416 --> 20:03.666
Hakeem too was trying to open his mouth,
but Franca was the actual devil.

20:04.583 --> 20:06.416
She was lucky
I wasn't there to deal with her.

20:06.500 --> 20:09.916
It's her type that sleeps
with useless men like Salako.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.166
Why did he sack you?

20:11.250 --> 20:12.958
Because he is a bastard.

20:13.041 --> 20:16.583
It won't end well for him,
the stress he put me through at that bank.

20:16.666 --> 20:18.125
He touched me up and down.

20:18.208 --> 20:19.541
Did you slap him?

20:20.833 --> 20:21.875
Why does it matter?

20:21.958 --> 20:23.416
[sighs]

20:23.500 --> 20:26.916
Why now Rose? Why?

20:28.083 --> 20:32.791
Tolani, because women like me and you
never get justice in this country.

20:33.625 --> 20:36.041
Only criminals get justice.

20:36.125 --> 20:38.583
Look at him.
Can't you see how corrupt he is?

20:39.250 --> 20:42.000
He steals from the bank,
steals from the customers

20:42.083 --> 20:43.791
and still collects bribes.

20:43.875 --> 20:45.541
Him and that snake Umar.

20:45.625 --> 20:47.333
[sucks teeth] Forget that one.

20:47.416 --> 20:49.916
Umar is a part of it, he's a part too!.

20:51.166 --> 20:54.500
Those bad debt letters you've been typing,
you think they'll be repaid?

20:54.583 --> 20:56.833
Salako opens an account for a big man

20:56.916 --> 20:59.416
and Umar gives the big man a loan.

20:59.500 --> 21:02.750
-Hmm.
-Big man then gives them both a cut.

21:02.833 --> 21:05.708
But the three of them know
the loan will never be repaid.

21:05.791 --> 21:08.375
What you think happens
with those dormant accounts?

21:08.458 --> 21:10.500
Salako is using them
as his personal accounts.

21:10.583 --> 21:12.375
It's why he's early every morning.

21:12.458 --> 21:14.416
So he can steal from them.

21:14.500 --> 21:17.708
The government ministers steal,
even the president steals.

21:17.791 --> 21:19.375
Then you toil and work hard,

21:19.458 --> 21:23.541
but still can't afford to buy meat
to put in your lunch in the afternoon.

21:24.250 --> 21:28.125
If I ever see that man again,
I will deal with him.

21:29.291 --> 21:30.250
Mm.

21:30.333 --> 21:31.166
[chuckles]

21:31.250 --> 21:33.458
Please my sister, just take it easy.

21:35.375 --> 21:38.291
My work of seven years. Seven years.

21:38.375 --> 21:40.583
Show me one person
that can type faster in that bank.

21:40.666 --> 21:43.666
Show me one person whose shorthand
is better than mine. Show me!

21:44.666 --> 21:45.875
[sighs]

21:45.958 --> 21:47.750
So what are you going to do now?

21:49.208 --> 21:51.125
Don't worry. I'll take care of myself.

21:53.791 --> 21:54.666
[clicks tongue]

21:56.166 --> 21:57.625
Our rent is due.

22:00.083 --> 22:02.041
I'll talk to Vali-- Violet.

22:02.125 --> 22:03.208
Violet?

22:03.916 --> 22:05.291
Are you sure?

22:05.375 --> 22:08.750
Yes, if I can't ask her for money,
who else can I ask?

22:09.250 --> 22:11.125
Ah. Okay.

22:16.166 --> 22:17.625
[sighs]

22:18.958 --> 22:21.750
[solemn music playing]

22:25.458 --> 22:26.708
Have you eaten?

22:26.791 --> 22:28.583
I don't feel like eating.

22:37.083 --> 22:37.958
[sucks teeth]

22:46.250 --> 22:48.625
-[speaking Italian] Come stai?
-[speaking Italian] Va bene.

22:48.708 --> 22:49.625
Bellissima.

22:49.708 --> 22:51.666
Oh, grazie, you speak Italiano?

22:51.750 --> 22:53.833
Ah, I stayed in Italy.

22:53.916 --> 22:57.000
You know, when I was in Italy,
I went to their "Vasasi" store.

22:57.083 --> 22:58.333
-Versace.
-Ah.

22:58.416 --> 23:01.583
Ah! Mamma mia, very good fashion.

23:02.250 --> 23:05.083
Ah, I'm telling you, I stayed in Italy.

23:05.166 --> 23:06.250
All right.

23:07.541 --> 23:08.916
Yes.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.916
-[laughing]
-Morning.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.250
Aunty.

23:12.333 --> 23:13.666
Morning sister Vio.

23:13.750 --> 23:16.166
Good morning. Rose. Why are you here?

23:16.750 --> 23:18.291
I need to talk to you.

23:20.625 --> 23:21.708
Go wait for me.

23:24.708 --> 23:25.708
Go wait for me now.

23:32.583 --> 23:34.291
-Hi there.
-Hey, aunty.

23:34.375 --> 23:37.541
-I'll be back soon, hmm? Pronto.
-[chuckles]

23:37.625 --> 23:39.083
Mabel!

23:39.166 --> 23:41.125
You see this one? Hmm? Just this one.

23:41.208 --> 23:42.750
-Yes.
-You finish loosening it.

23:42.833 --> 23:44.416
-Okay, ma.
-I'll be right back.

23:45.500 --> 23:46.958
-Pronto.
-No problem.

24:01.541 --> 24:04.041
Rose, what is it?

24:05.208 --> 24:06.541
I want to borrow some money.

24:08.041 --> 24:09.916
-I don't have money.
-How?

24:10.000 --> 24:10.833
Hmm.

24:11.416 --> 24:12.458
I don't have money.

24:12.541 --> 24:14.208
Why didn't you ask Tolani?

24:14.291 --> 24:16.916
Why would I ask her? Is she my relative?

24:17.000 --> 24:19.125
Anyway, I don't have money.

24:19.708 --> 24:21.083
I've come all this way!

24:21.166 --> 24:23.833
-You should've called.
-What phone am I going to use?

24:23.916 --> 24:27.541
-Aren't there call centers in your area?
-There are no working lines in my area.

24:27.625 --> 24:30.125
Rose, I don't have money.

24:30.875 --> 24:32.708
I don't have. Can you hear me?

24:32.791 --> 24:34.541
The last time I borrowed you money,

24:34.625 --> 24:37.541
it took you a long time
to return my money.

24:38.708 --> 24:40.916
Therefore,
I don't have money to give you.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.208
But Fedele sends you money every month.

24:43.291 --> 24:44.208
For his daughter.

24:44.291 --> 24:45.500
In foreign currency?

24:46.208 --> 24:48.166
See, we are talking of lira.

24:48.750 --> 24:50.666
Lira is not that strong.

24:50.750 --> 24:53.875
It's not like we are talking
about dollars or pounds sterling.

24:57.500 --> 25:01.083
But you have money to live in Keffi
and to rent a shop in Onikan?

25:01.166 --> 25:02.541
Will you behave yourself?

25:03.291 --> 25:05.208
I don't have time for this nonsense.

25:06.500 --> 25:07.916
What is the matter with you?

25:08.583 --> 25:10.333
I don't have money to lend you.

25:10.916 --> 25:12.791
The only thing I can do is,

25:12.875 --> 25:16.708
give you a little bit, you know,
something to get you by.

25:18.083 --> 25:21.250
Sisi said we should help each other.
That's what she said.

25:21.333 --> 25:23.291
Sisi can say whatever she likes!

25:23.375 --> 25:27.000
-Really!
-Yes! What? It's the truth.

25:27.083 --> 25:29.625
Ah-ah. Sisi can say whatever she wants.

25:29.708 --> 25:32.875
That's small town talk. Let me tell you.

25:32.958 --> 25:35.125
Sisi had so many children.

25:35.208 --> 25:37.500
In fact, too many
and she can't afford them.

25:37.583 --> 25:40.125
If it wasn't for my father,
I wouldn't have gone to Italy.

25:40.875 --> 25:43.875
I wouldn't have met Fedele.
I wouldn't have had my child.

25:43.958 --> 25:47.458
In fact, I wouldn't be sitting here today.

25:48.833 --> 25:51.208
Vio, you'll never see me insulting Sisi.

25:51.875 --> 25:54.500
My dad paid for my secretarial studies,
if you don't know.

25:54.583 --> 25:57.708
I know. That's the only thing
he could help her with.

25:57.791 --> 26:02.166
Don't insult my father, don't try it.
Don't even go there.

26:02.750 --> 26:04.833
-My father was a generous man.
-Hm.

26:04.916 --> 26:06.083
Generous indeed.

26:06.833 --> 26:10.000
The only thing is
that his salary as a teacher

26:10.083 --> 26:12.583
didn't afford him any luxuries.
Just the little things--

26:12.666 --> 26:16.166
Ah, Violet you have--
you have a bad mouth!

26:16.250 --> 26:17.416
You talk nonsense.

26:17.500 --> 26:19.791
-What about yours?
-Sisi said it! You have a bad mouth.

26:19.875 --> 26:23.166
And yours isn't uncouth?
Look at you, hypocrite. Am I your senior?

26:23.250 --> 26:24.541
Don't be rude to me.

26:24.625 --> 26:27.166
But really,
weren't we brought up together?

26:27.250 --> 26:30.541
Tell me, were we not raised the same way?

26:30.625 --> 26:32.750
Didn't we drink garri and water together?

26:33.375 --> 26:36.166
Hmm? Rose, I don't have money.

26:36.250 --> 26:37.166
Am I clear?

26:39.083 --> 26:41.500
Oh, so now you've become
a big woman in Lagos.

26:41.583 --> 26:42.916
[chuckles]

26:44.083 --> 26:46.708
No problem. Everybody has their time.

26:49.833 --> 26:50.958
I don't have money.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.458
Chukwuebuka!

26:58.541 --> 26:59.625
[kid] Ma!

27:00.875 --> 27:02.875
Bring what I asked you to bring for me.

27:03.750 --> 27:07.291
♪ If you want to marry a woman ♪

27:10.791 --> 27:13.458
-Mama Chidi.
-Please go and bring the second one.

27:13.541 --> 27:15.291
[chuckles] Mrs. Durojaye.

27:15.375 --> 27:17.916
-How are you?
-I'm fine, welcome.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.208
I admire your car.

27:19.291 --> 27:22.583
It takes you out and brings you back.

27:23.916 --> 27:28.958
It really helps.
Mama Chidi, to have a car really helps.

27:29.041 --> 27:32.041
Hey, I can't forget when
the last one finally broke down.

27:32.125 --> 27:35.083
Ah! Mama Chidi, I struggled.

27:35.166 --> 27:38.125
But we thank God. We thank God.

27:38.916 --> 27:45.833
My sister, maybe one day
Papa Chidi too will be able to buy one.

27:48.208 --> 27:50.791
What are you thinking? It's fairly used.

27:50.875 --> 27:53.833
-Really?
-Yes. Imported.

27:54.541 --> 27:58.083
My sister, I'll be happy with any one,

27:58.166 --> 28:01.291
whether it's used or an imported car.

28:01.375 --> 28:04.041
As long as it's from overseas, it's okay.

28:04.708 --> 28:10.000
But see, you will have to wait
till after twelve noon

28:10.083 --> 28:12.458
on sanitation day before you go out.

28:12.541 --> 28:15.708
And if you must get
a number plate license,

28:15.791 --> 28:19.708
it has to be the type of mine,
an odd number.

28:19.791 --> 28:23.166
So that you can at least
go out three times in a week.

28:23.958 --> 28:28.250
Even me during weekdays,
I wake up very, very early.

28:28.333 --> 28:30.458
As early as 5:00 a.m. to go out.

28:30.541 --> 28:34.250
Because anything after 7:00,
that's another problem.

28:34.333 --> 28:35.333
Hmm.

28:35.416 --> 28:36.916
That is a good thing.

28:37.500 --> 28:41.500
-Ah-ah. Rose. Welcome. How are you?
-Mama Chidi.

28:41.583 --> 28:44.375
I'm fine, how are your children?

28:44.958 --> 28:48.625
We thank God.
We're planning to cook beans today.

28:48.708 --> 28:50.208
How is Papa Chidi?

28:50.916 --> 28:54.083
He's fine, thanks to God. Welcome, eh.

28:55.250 --> 28:56.375
Well done.

29:00.291 --> 29:01.791
[sucks teeth]

29:02.750 --> 29:04.333
Rubbish.

29:05.750 --> 29:10.250
An extremely useless individual.

29:10.333 --> 29:12.750
Worthless and no use to anyone.

29:13.500 --> 29:15.375
-Okay, Mama Chidi.
-Hm?

29:15.458 --> 29:17.291
I'm going inside.

29:17.375 --> 29:19.791
Let me go and remove my drawers,
I'm sweating.

29:19.875 --> 29:20.791
Okay.

29:23.250 --> 29:24.458
Chukwuebuka!

29:24.541 --> 29:25.833
What a pity.

29:25.916 --> 29:29.708
Not at all,
Vio is wicked. Sisi told me already.

29:29.791 --> 29:32.375
She said if Vio
saw her injured on the road,

29:32.458 --> 29:34.041
she'd leave her to die.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.583
At least she should send money
to your mother now.

29:37.666 --> 29:39.583
What? What are you saying?

29:39.666 --> 29:43.750
Sisi has never gotten even one single kobo
from Vio since she came back from Italy.

29:43.833 --> 29:44.750
For real?

29:44.833 --> 29:45.916
Not even one!

29:46.875 --> 29:50.500
She only knows how to shout "mamma mia,"
when she has customers.

29:51.625 --> 29:52.708
Violet.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.791
She doesn't want anyone
to know we're sisters.

29:54.875 --> 29:58.416
She doesn't understand any Italian!
She doesn't, she's just pretending.

29:58.500 --> 30:01.875
And she met Fedele
when she was cleaning his house!

30:01.958 --> 30:03.250
Hmm?

30:03.333 --> 30:06.250
Please, I'm starting to have a headache.

30:08.333 --> 30:09.958
This world…

30:10.708 --> 30:13.791
I'm thinking maybe
I should even be grateful.

30:13.875 --> 30:15.791
That Mrs., uh…

30:15.875 --> 30:17.083
Durojaye…

30:17.166 --> 30:19.000
Whatever she calls herself. Her.

30:19.083 --> 30:21.083
One day she'll kill one of her children.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.458
When I passed her just now,

30:23.541 --> 30:26.083
she was giving me the stink eye,
like I stole her husband.

30:26.166 --> 30:28.458
-[laughs]
-No wonder the man divorced her.

30:28.541 --> 30:32.833
Who wants to wake up
to such an angry face every day?

30:33.708 --> 30:35.875
One day she'll kill one of her children.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.291
Is there any food?

30:49.416 --> 30:53.416
Umar. That is it,
see me later in my office.

30:54.458 --> 30:55.916
-Tolani.
-Yes, sir?

30:56.000 --> 30:57.250
See me in my office.

30:58.666 --> 31:02.375
Mr. Salako has requested
that you be transferred downstairs,

31:02.458 --> 31:03.458
to work with him.

31:04.958 --> 31:06.208
Why, sir?

31:06.916 --> 31:11.541
He wants someone from within the bank
to replace his secretary.

31:11.625 --> 31:14.166
I've told him that you'll
be available from tomorrow.

31:14.250 --> 31:18.541
I want you to clean out your desk today
and report to him downstairs.

31:19.958 --> 31:22.375
But I have plenty of letters to type, sir.

31:22.833 --> 31:23.916
What letters?

31:24.000 --> 31:27.250
Bad debts.
There's so many of them and…

31:28.083 --> 31:30.500
Sir, please, I like it here in loans.

31:30.583 --> 31:33.875
Mr. Salako has requested
that you be transferred.

31:48.875 --> 31:49.875
[knocking]

31:51.333 --> 31:52.583
[knocking]

31:52.666 --> 31:53.583
Yes.

31:54.208 --> 31:55.291
Come in.

32:01.500 --> 32:02.708
Hmph!

32:09.041 --> 32:11.583
Alhaji Umar said
I should report to you sir.

32:11.666 --> 32:13.916
Hm, yes, um, Miss Ajao.

32:14.750 --> 32:17.416
I had a meeting with him regarding,

32:18.416 --> 32:19.625
uh…

32:19.708 --> 32:22.208
my former secretary. What's her name?

32:22.291 --> 32:23.666
What's her name again?

32:23.750 --> 32:26.416
-Rose Adamson, sir.
-Mm-hmm!

32:27.875 --> 32:33.833
I think you are the suitable person
for that… office.

32:35.500 --> 32:39.750
Because whenever I see you,
you always appear neat.

32:39.833 --> 32:41.500
Very neat.

32:41.583 --> 32:43.750
Eh. And you're a Yoruba girl?

32:45.375 --> 32:46.666
-Yes sir.
-Okay.

32:47.833 --> 32:50.500
Please, you are from where?

32:51.708 --> 32:53.208
Makoku, sir.

32:54.500 --> 32:56.958
Makoku. Makoku interior I guess.

32:57.541 --> 32:59.666
We're not interior people.
We're Egba, sir.

32:59.750 --> 33:00.583
Huh?

33:01.791 --> 33:02.958
Did you say Egba?

33:03.041 --> 33:04.125
Yes, sir.

33:04.208 --> 33:07.166
Okay. What does your father do?

33:09.166 --> 33:10.875
My father was a drummer sir.

33:12.500 --> 33:15.083
[drumming]

33:19.208 --> 33:21.291
Was a drummer? Oh.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.583
He's passed on. What a pity.
May God grant him heavenly rest.

33:26.166 --> 33:27.041
Thank you, sir.

33:27.125 --> 33:29.458
God grant him heavenly rest.
And your mother?

33:30.625 --> 33:35.041
My mother makes adire.
She's a cloth dyer sir.

33:43.750 --> 33:48.500
Hm. I see. I see.
Whatever, they raised you well.

33:49.708 --> 33:50.958
You have manners.

33:52.208 --> 33:54.750
Anyway, what about your diction?

33:55.458 --> 33:57.333
Diction, English.

33:57.416 --> 33:58.708
My diction, sir?

33:58.791 --> 34:01.500
Your diction!
Ah, don't you understand English?

34:01.583 --> 34:04.000
How do you… do you speak and write?

34:04.583 --> 34:06.000
My diction is fine, sir.

34:06.083 --> 34:10.208
Uh, what… whatever,
let's give it to Rose. Hm.

34:11.083 --> 34:16.125
Her English grammar, diction

34:16.208 --> 34:18.958
were excellent. Very excellent.

34:19.958 --> 34:24.416
Anyway, you will go to her desk now,
clean the desk for me.

34:24.500 --> 34:27.750
Because the last time
I tried to check the desk,

34:27.833 --> 34:31.166
the whole place looked horrible.

34:31.250 --> 34:34.583
Like, uh, she packed a lot of juju there.

34:34.666 --> 34:37.083
-Juju?
-Yes, juju. Hmm.

34:38.625 --> 34:40.458
Like you don't know what juju is.

34:41.625 --> 34:44.083
-Go and clean the place.
-[phone ringing]

34:47.625 --> 34:48.458
Hello.

34:50.083 --> 34:51.083
Ah.

34:51.750 --> 34:52.958
Hello, sir.

34:54.375 --> 34:56.458
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

35:03.375 --> 35:06.500
You don't know my job,
you don't know what my job entails.

35:06.583 --> 35:07.833
You don't know anything.

35:07.916 --> 35:11.041
There's nothing that entails
anything in that… in that bank.

35:11.125 --> 35:14.458
All the work I was doing for Alhaji Umar
last week, he didn't even know.

35:14.541 --> 35:16.375
What could it possibly entail?

35:16.458 --> 35:20.583
You say hello to a customer,
the customer says hello to you. Finish!

35:20.666 --> 35:22.791
No. Tolani, no.

35:22.875 --> 35:26.666
Look, when a customer
comes in or they call on the phone,

35:26.750 --> 35:28.291
the way you interact with them

35:28.875 --> 35:31.916
should make them
relaxed and very comfortable.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.291
I did all this there.

35:33.958 --> 35:34.958
I don't want to.

35:35.041 --> 35:36.916
So why not tell him
you didn't want the job?

35:37.000 --> 35:38.083
[scoffs]

35:38.166 --> 35:39.083
How?

35:41.041 --> 35:42.625
This man knows what he's doing.

35:42.708 --> 35:45.250
He's doing it because he knows
we live together.

35:45.333 --> 35:47.000
He wants me to come and beg him.

35:47.083 --> 35:49.125
Over my dead body.
I'll never go beg him.

35:50.291 --> 35:51.875
Is he that scared of juju?

35:52.625 --> 35:54.958
That man? He's worse than an illiterate.

35:56.458 --> 35:58.541
And that smell in his office, what is it?

35:58.625 --> 36:00.875
He farts. He farts a lot.

36:00.958 --> 36:01.958
[laughs]

36:02.041 --> 36:03.791
You'll get used to it.

36:03.875 --> 36:06.666
And you'll get used to it
when he starts touching you.

36:06.750 --> 36:08.208
God forbid.

36:13.708 --> 36:16.708
[melodic pop song playing]

36:42.791 --> 36:43.958
Johnny, Johnny.

36:44.041 --> 36:47.833
Ah, Rambling Rose!
Don't contaminate this contraband.

36:47.916 --> 36:49.458
You never ask after me.

36:49.541 --> 36:51.916
-Do you ask?
-This is my only wife in Lagos.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.625
So tell me,
where are you guys rambling to today?

36:54.708 --> 36:57.833
We want to buy shoes, but your shoes
are always too expensive…

36:57.916 --> 36:59.708
Is that so!

36:59.791 --> 37:02.250
So that's why you never patronize me.
No problem.

37:02.333 --> 37:04.541
This is my friend,
I'm taking him to a boutique.

37:04.625 --> 37:07.583
You know he doesn't shop around here.
We need to upgrade.

37:07.666 --> 37:08.666
Hello.

37:08.750 --> 37:11.291
Eh, O to the C! OC Money!

37:11.375 --> 37:14.916
You see these two,
they're my favorite customers in Lagos.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.208
Now see this one,
he's an original fly guy!

37:17.291 --> 37:20.125
He just came back from United States.

37:20.208 --> 37:22.375
-Of America?
-Is there another one?

37:22.458 --> 37:24.541
Really? Okay then.

37:24.625 --> 37:26.750
-This one is your size.
-Buy these for me.

37:26.833 --> 37:28.333
-You mean this?
-Hm.

37:29.083 --> 37:30.833
Baby, see.

37:31.750 --> 37:33.250
Austerity measures.

37:33.333 --> 37:36.041
Ah, Johnny, you haven't changed,
you're still stingy,

37:36.125 --> 37:37.291
Please leave my shoes.

37:37.375 --> 37:39.166
-How much is it?
-Five naira, that seven naira.

37:39.250 --> 37:41.000
-How much?
-I'll pay two naira fifty kobo.

37:41.083 --> 37:42.125
Seven naira.

37:42.208 --> 37:43.750
I'm paying two naira, 50 kobo.

37:43.833 --> 37:45.458
-Did you tell her five?
-It's seven.

37:45.541 --> 37:46.625
It's seven naira.

37:46.708 --> 37:48.250
-Five naira.
-Five for the two of them.

37:48.333 --> 37:50.166
No. Okay, you pay six naira.

37:50.250 --> 37:53.166
-We don't have that. Two naira, 50 kobo.
-No.

37:53.250 --> 37:54.958
-Hey Johnny!
-Yes?

37:55.041 --> 37:57.500
No time, you know. I'll pay.

37:57.583 --> 37:58.666
Huh?

37:58.750 --> 38:01.041
-OC Money!
-It's all good.

38:01.125 --> 38:02.541
Okay! Put it in a bag.

38:03.166 --> 38:06.458
Thank you. My name is Rose.

38:07.500 --> 38:10.583
My name is OC.
But my friends call me OC Money.

38:11.125 --> 38:14.250
What are you doing with this person,
he doesn't like spending money.

38:14.333 --> 38:17.166
[laughs] He's a cool guy,
you know, very cool guy.

38:17.250 --> 38:18.833
Can I come visit you?

38:21.291 --> 38:22.416
Sure.

38:22.916 --> 38:27.000
All right, you should
give me your address.

38:28.083 --> 38:29.958
-My address?
-Yes.

38:40.250 --> 38:41.583
-So, we'll see.
-Yeah.

38:42.666 --> 38:44.125
-Take care.
-Yeah.

38:46.083 --> 38:47.500
He's nice.

38:47.583 --> 38:49.041
-Who?
-Uh-uh.

38:49.666 --> 38:51.666
-OC now.
-You don't know him, let's go.

38:59.916 --> 39:01.541
[knocking on door]

39:05.416 --> 39:06.958
[knocking]

39:21.208 --> 39:22.250
You?

39:26.291 --> 39:27.333
Come in.

39:29.500 --> 39:31.291
Please make yourself comfortable.

39:51.500 --> 39:52.625
Here we are.

39:53.958 --> 39:55.666
So what can I offer you?

39:56.625 --> 39:57.458
Beer.

40:03.666 --> 40:04.750
What is it?

40:05.833 --> 40:07.625
Let me get you some wine instead.

40:07.708 --> 40:09.708
No, I only drink beer.

40:12.541 --> 40:13.791
It's not ladylike.

40:14.458 --> 40:16.166
Wine is better, trust me.

40:20.541 --> 40:22.416
I'll drink whatever you give me.

40:24.166 --> 40:26.416
Wine it is. I'll be right back.

40:28.458 --> 40:32.416
[upbeat music playing]

40:39.125 --> 40:42.833
Ah, you should've seen OC's house,
there's no gadget he doesn't have.

40:43.416 --> 40:45.791
And he's as generous as my father.

40:47.750 --> 40:49.041
Can you imagine?

40:49.791 --> 40:53.041
When I was there, what's his name…
Johnny came by.

40:53.125 --> 40:56.083
He started asking me questions
when OC went to the kitchen.

40:56.166 --> 40:57.958
-Okay, so feel free okay?
-Okay.

41:02.000 --> 41:02.916
Rose,

41:03.791 --> 41:06.833
what is going on
between you and him?

41:07.666 --> 41:08.875
How is it your business?

41:16.791 --> 41:18.875
I just ignored him. Nonsense.

41:20.500 --> 41:23.333
He claims he is into import and export

41:23.416 --> 41:27.166
and yet he never bought me
even a drink when we were dating.

41:27.750 --> 41:31.583
But now he wants to monitor me,
asking silly questions. Please.

41:32.333 --> 41:33.875
OC is his friend.

41:33.958 --> 41:34.833
And so?

41:35.541 --> 41:38.000
Hasn't it been long enough since we dated?

41:38.666 --> 41:42.125
He doesn't own me,
I can do anything I want.

41:43.625 --> 41:46.833
He probably has many girlfriends.
You know how he is.

41:47.750 --> 41:50.083
Please, let me drink my wine.

41:51.125 --> 41:53.708
OC said I should stop drinking beer.

41:57.791 --> 42:01.541
Uh. Please, uh, get me that file.

42:01.625 --> 42:02.750
Okay, sir.

42:12.958 --> 42:14.583
[tense music builds]

42:14.666 --> 42:15.875
[tense music fades away]

42:19.166 --> 42:20.125
Here it is, sir.

42:21.250 --> 42:22.500
Thank you.

42:31.666 --> 42:32.625
[sighs]

42:36.625 --> 42:39.500
OC it was a struggle coming here today.

42:39.583 --> 42:40.875
I really struggled.

42:41.875 --> 42:44.416
So if you want to see me again,

42:44.500 --> 42:46.625
you'll have to start giving me taxi money.

42:50.333 --> 42:55.083
And I mean the proper taxis,
not those rickety ones.

42:56.708 --> 42:58.375
That's no problem, you know.

42:59.125 --> 43:01.916
Thank you.
Because I have no money left.

43:03.250 --> 43:05.333
I don't even have money for rent.

43:09.083 --> 43:11.958
That's no problem too,
I'll take care of that.

43:12.625 --> 43:13.791
Thank you.

43:20.208 --> 43:25.041
You know, while you're at it,
don't you think you need new shoes?

43:26.000 --> 43:27.458
Uh-uh. Why?

43:28.041 --> 43:29.583
Your shoe is old.

43:30.958 --> 43:32.291
From trekking now.

43:34.041 --> 43:37.708
Your friend was right, you know?
You should start wearing better shoes.

43:39.125 --> 43:41.625
Who has time
to wear high heels everywhere?

43:44.750 --> 43:46.083
I'm only offering.

43:52.791 --> 43:54.708
If you want to buy, no problem.

43:54.791 --> 43:58.333
Buy, I won't say no. As long as it's free.

43:59.333 --> 44:00.375
Not exactly.

44:04.916 --> 44:06.250
How?

44:09.583 --> 44:11.875
[tense music builds]

44:11.958 --> 44:14.250
You will have to do something for me.

44:15.625 --> 44:17.708
[humming]

44:21.791 --> 44:23.375
Your shoes are nice.

44:23.458 --> 44:26.458
Really? You can have any you want.

44:27.916 --> 44:29.250
They're not my size.

44:31.583 --> 44:33.750
Just tired. Today I did a lot of shopping.

44:35.125 --> 44:36.458
I shopped.

44:39.125 --> 44:41.916
When are you going
to start looking for another job?

44:42.000 --> 44:43.791
Uh-uh. Why?

44:43.875 --> 44:47.916
I'm just saying, you don't want
to get used to being at home for too long.

44:48.708 --> 44:50.916
Ah, I'm not… I'm not looking for a job.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.541
I don't want to work again.

44:52.625 --> 44:55.666
OC said I shouldn't work,
that he'll take care of me.

44:55.750 --> 44:57.791
He even asked me to move in with him.

44:58.916 --> 45:00.041
What?

45:00.125 --> 45:02.166
But I told him I wasn't ready.

45:03.000 --> 45:06.375
He said I'm the kind of woman
he would like to marry.

45:08.500 --> 45:10.416
-When?
-Today.

45:10.500 --> 45:12.666
After how many days of knowing you?

45:15.166 --> 45:16.000
Eh.

45:17.083 --> 45:20.458
Let me tell you something.
You are not a child!

45:20.541 --> 45:23.708
You cannot move into a house
with a man you barely know.

45:23.791 --> 45:24.625
Or marry him.

45:24.708 --> 45:28.416
Anybody who does that kind of thing
is clearly asking for trouble.

45:29.375 --> 45:31.416
No quarrel, is it your problem?

45:32.791 --> 45:34.208
Is it not my trouble?

45:35.916 --> 45:37.166
It's your problem.

45:38.208 --> 45:39.416
Silly girl.

45:39.500 --> 45:41.291
Why are you so upset about it?

45:44.500 --> 45:47.416
You know what baffles me
the most about this whole thing?

45:48.250 --> 45:53.375
It's that it's been just three weeks
since they started dating.

45:54.416 --> 45:56.250
He's already talking about marriage.

46:00.958 --> 46:05.541
Look, Tolani, why don't you stop focusing
on those people's business?

46:06.375 --> 46:07.208
Okay.

46:08.083 --> 46:10.458
She doesn't work, she doesn't do anything.

46:11.125 --> 46:14.083
And she's always eating my food.

46:14.166 --> 46:16.333
Did she just start eating your food today?

46:16.416 --> 46:18.375
She didn't just
start eating my food today,

46:18.458 --> 46:21.541
but what if she moves out
and is no longer paying the rent?

46:21.625 --> 46:23.750
What would I do? Where would I go?

46:24.375 --> 46:28.000
Okay. Whenever I ask her where he lives,

46:28.083 --> 46:31.666
she says it's in Ikeja,
it's in Along, or something else.

46:31.750 --> 46:34.333
She has never once told me where he lives.

46:34.416 --> 46:39.083
She's never told me! What is Rose hiding?

46:39.166 --> 46:42.000
-What exactly is she hiding?
-Why don't you just ask her?

46:42.083 --> 46:45.375
I should ask her? Have you not heard
anything I've been saying?

46:47.708 --> 46:49.375
All this, I'm tired.

46:50.083 --> 46:51.875
I'm tired of all this stress.

46:53.791 --> 46:56.208
That reminds me,
the business you wanted to do,

46:57.041 --> 46:58.583
is your uncle giving you money for it?

47:00.125 --> 47:01.125
No.

47:01.708 --> 47:04.458
I don't want him in my business at all.

47:05.708 --> 47:06.875
Why?

47:06.958 --> 47:11.083
When I establish this business,
starts going well, bringing in money,

47:11.166 --> 47:12.791
it'll mean I'm set and can be on my own.

47:13.541 --> 47:15.250
Ah, that's good but,

47:16.916 --> 47:18.208
where will you get money?

47:18.291 --> 47:20.875
What do you think
I've been running around for?

47:22.458 --> 47:25.166
But, it would be too late.

47:26.375 --> 47:29.583
That would take too long.

47:29.666 --> 47:33.708
I suggest I give you
what little I have left of my savings,

47:33.791 --> 47:38.166
so you can add it
to the money you have. Eh?

47:39.000 --> 47:40.875
And then you can start from there.

47:43.291 --> 47:46.500
Tolani, I didn't come here
to beg for money.

47:46.583 --> 47:50.291
I know, Sanwo, I know you didn't
come here to beg for money,

47:50.375 --> 47:52.500
but it'll take too long.

47:52.583 --> 47:54.416
Too long before you have enough .

47:54.500 --> 47:55.916
Let me help you out.

47:58.041 --> 48:01.625
[faint clapping and singing]

48:04.458 --> 48:05.916
What is happening?

48:11.833 --> 48:13.750
-Ayo!
-Yes?

48:13.833 --> 48:15.916
-What are you doing there?
-I'm playing.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.666
You're playing?
Look, let your mother catch you there,

48:18.750 --> 48:20.208
you'll be in real trouble.

48:20.291 --> 48:22.666
You're playing. Where is Philomena?

48:22.750 --> 48:24.000
I don't know.

48:24.083 --> 48:27.166
You don't know? Doesn't she know
how much your mother pays her

48:27.250 --> 48:30.416
to watch over you guys,
and you're playing all over the place.

48:30.500 --> 48:33.458
Would you get off
that place you're playing?

48:34.250 --> 48:35.666
These children!

48:39.375 --> 48:41.750
What is it? Should I let him hurt himself?

48:46.500 --> 48:47.625
Um…

48:48.541 --> 48:50.208
-Tolani.
-Hmm?

48:50.958 --> 48:52.750
The money you talked about earlier,

48:53.791 --> 48:55.500
uh, I have thought about it.

48:55.583 --> 48:56.583
Ah.

48:58.458 --> 48:59.583
And…

49:01.416 --> 49:05.541
I'll take whatever amount you have.
And I'll pay it back.

49:05.625 --> 49:06.708
Uh-huh.

49:08.333 --> 49:10.458
But, I can't take the money from you,

49:12.666 --> 49:13.958
when you're like this.

49:16.000 --> 49:20.083
I hear you.
I'll calm down until you're done.

49:22.750 --> 49:25.291
[gentle music playing]

49:27.750 --> 49:28.916
I'll be expecting you.

49:31.000 --> 49:32.333
You can have it.

49:36.583 --> 49:37.958
-Thank you.
-Bye.

49:38.833 --> 49:40.708
Can you get me the file, please?

49:42.916 --> 49:44.375
What file, sir?

49:44.458 --> 49:46.000
Hmm, quarterly budget.

49:51.166 --> 49:53.583
[tense music playing]

50:00.000 --> 50:02.583
-Mr. Salako!
-Who is that?

50:02.666 --> 50:03.708
Can't you knock?!

50:04.875 --> 50:07.791
Can't you knock?
See how her mouth is open.

50:07.875 --> 50:10.875
-I thought you said I should come in.
-No! I didn't say so.

50:10.958 --> 50:13.625
I didn't say. When did I say so?

50:13.708 --> 50:15.416
Get out! Get out.

50:15.500 --> 50:17.291
What's that?

50:17.375 --> 50:19.041
What can I do for you?

50:19.125 --> 50:22.083
There's a messenger from First Bank,
they asked to see you.

50:22.166 --> 50:24.750
Mm, tell the person to wait.
Tell him to wait.

50:24.833 --> 50:26.541
I'm busy. And let me warn you,

50:26.625 --> 50:32.000
next time you, you come in like that,
I will sack you.

50:32.083 --> 50:33.833
Come on, go, go. Leave my office.

50:35.583 --> 50:37.583
-Okay.
-Mm.

50:37.666 --> 50:40.708
Get the hell out.
Keep on walking aimlessly.

50:41.291 --> 50:42.458
Be going!

50:42.541 --> 50:44.125
Where's the file?

50:44.208 --> 50:46.208
-Here's the file, sir.
-Let me have it!

50:47.000 --> 50:48.333
Look at her.

50:49.166 --> 50:51.375
Always walking seductively,
shaking her butt.

50:51.458 --> 50:52.791
I know what you're doing.

51:00.750 --> 51:02.958
Tolani, this is what I'm saying.

51:03.625 --> 51:08.375
You see, whatever the world about a person
is not always who the person is.

51:09.458 --> 51:12.541
The person might not
see themselves in that light.

51:13.750 --> 51:16.000
Let me give you an example.

51:16.083 --> 51:17.666
If a man comes and says,

51:17.750 --> 51:24.125
"Ah, this girl is well mannered,
she's virtuous, she's honorable."

51:24.208 --> 51:28.583
Within you, you know it's possible
that you're not all those things.

51:28.666 --> 51:29.500
Do you understand?

51:30.708 --> 51:32.583
The point I'm trying to make is this.

51:32.666 --> 51:37.291
If you know you're well-mannered,
virtuous, and honorable,

51:38.083 --> 51:40.250
you make sure to protect your reputation.

51:40.333 --> 51:43.166
You won't let life or any man
take it away from you.

51:43.250 --> 51:45.791
-Do you understand?
-I understand, Mom.

51:45.875 --> 51:47.333
-Are you sure?
-I understand.

51:51.833 --> 51:53.041
[toilet flushing]

51:53.125 --> 51:54.541
OC.

51:54.625 --> 51:57.750
What kind of job do you do
that you make this much money?

51:59.166 --> 52:00.375
Hmm?

52:03.916 --> 52:06.958
I'm asking because
I want to make my own money.

52:08.250 --> 52:10.125
You have a passport?

52:10.208 --> 52:13.416
-Passport? Yes I have plenty of passports.
-No, not that type.

52:14.708 --> 52:16.625
An international passport.

52:17.583 --> 52:18.583
Oh.

52:19.916 --> 52:21.250
No, I don't.

52:21.916 --> 52:23.041
Why?

52:26.625 --> 52:28.000
You should've told me.

52:29.083 --> 52:32.125
I've been suspecting
that you were doing something illegal.

52:32.208 --> 52:33.541
But I didn't know what.

52:33.625 --> 52:38.041
I thought you were, um,
trading dollars on the black market.

52:38.583 --> 52:40.291
I knew it was something illegal.

52:42.083 --> 52:43.125
Listen, OC,

52:44.625 --> 52:45.666
I can do it.

52:47.333 --> 52:48.208
I'm not afraid.

52:49.416 --> 52:50.458
I can do it.

52:52.083 --> 52:53.083
Trust me.

52:54.375 --> 52:55.916
Listen, when I was growing up,

52:56.000 --> 52:58.208
all these stupid old men
started touching me,

52:58.291 --> 53:00.416
but I learned how to fight them.

53:00.500 --> 53:01.916
But poverty?

53:04.708 --> 53:09.291
That's a different thing altogether.
And I don't want to face it again.

53:10.333 --> 53:13.041
I… I do not really know
how to put this…

53:13.125 --> 53:16.208
but, uh, certain information
just reached my attention,

53:16.291 --> 53:18.000
and I want to know if it is true.

53:18.666 --> 53:20.291
What information?

53:20.375 --> 53:24.208
Were you and Salako
caught in flagrante delicto?

53:24.958 --> 53:26.291
What does that mean?

53:26.375 --> 53:30.125
Well you know… you know, um…

53:31.041 --> 53:32.291
Well?

53:32.375 --> 53:34.250
Tell Franca to stay away from me.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.750
That is not… I mean,
that is not part of the issue here.

53:37.833 --> 53:40.833
Really? Then you are like her then.

53:41.708 --> 53:42.833
Tolani!

53:42.916 --> 53:46.416
I'm sorry, uncle, I don't have
time for this. Please, beans for me.

54:27.625 --> 54:29.291
[coughs]

54:30.041 --> 54:32.666
[gags, coughs]

54:34.416 --> 54:35.583
[gags]

54:46.833 --> 54:48.333
[coughs]

54:55.583 --> 54:57.041
Ayo!

54:57.125 --> 54:58.333
Ayo!

54:58.416 --> 54:59.625
Eh!

54:59.708 --> 55:02.125
Ayo! Eh!

55:02.208 --> 55:03.583
We need a longer stick.

55:03.666 --> 55:06.250
This is the only stick we could find.

55:06.333 --> 55:09.250
Go across the road,
there are bamboo sticks there.

55:09.333 --> 55:12.833
I don't want those people to know
what is happening in this compound.

55:12.916 --> 55:15.541
Go there, don't let them know
what's happening here.

55:15.625 --> 55:19.500
Please help me go
and collect a longer stick.

55:19.583 --> 55:21.000
Ayo.

55:22.875 --> 55:24.416
Tolani!

55:24.500 --> 55:25.458
Where is the stick?

55:25.541 --> 55:26.708
It is taking time.

55:26.791 --> 55:29.041
Ayo fell into the septic tank.
We're trying to get him out.

55:29.125 --> 55:30.750
That Philomena is wicked.

55:30.833 --> 55:33.208
-Where is she exactly?
-She ran away.

55:33.291 --> 55:37.875
If I see her, I'll personally beat her up.
Then call the police to arrest her for me.

55:37.958 --> 55:39.458
Ayo.

55:39.541 --> 55:42.291
The stick now!
The stick. It's taking a long time.

55:42.375 --> 55:43.375
They're bringing it.

55:47.208 --> 55:48.458
Ayo!

55:54.375 --> 55:58.750
Somebody help me!
Somebody help me!

55:59.875 --> 56:01.375
Ayo!

56:05.250 --> 56:06.458
Ayo!

56:10.083 --> 56:12.750
Ayo, why?

56:14.541 --> 56:15.875
-Ayo.
-Where is he?

56:15.958 --> 56:17.833
-Ayo.
-Which Ayo?

56:17.916 --> 56:20.333
I'm dead! Ayo!

56:20.416 --> 56:24.333
I am dead! Help me bring him out!

56:24.416 --> 56:26.791
-Don't let me lose my child, please!
-Mama Ayo!

56:26.875 --> 56:28.750
Please!

56:28.833 --> 56:30.250
-Mama Ayo!
-Help me carry him!

56:30.333 --> 56:32.750
Mama Chidi!

56:32.833 --> 56:34.041
Ayo.

56:34.125 --> 56:38.416
Take her away from here now.
Help me bring him out!

56:49.916 --> 56:51.291
Sorry for your loss.

56:51.375 --> 56:53.791
-May we not have any more loss.
-So sorry.

56:53.875 --> 56:58.625
Mother, They said I should do my hair
before school tomorrow.

56:58.708 --> 57:01.833
God will comfort you.

57:01.916 --> 57:03.791
Mother, why are you not talking?

57:03.875 --> 57:05.833
Don't cry again.

57:05.916 --> 57:08.416
Take heart. Sorry for your loss.

57:08.500 --> 57:13.708
Stop crying. God will look…
God will be with you both.

57:14.541 --> 57:16.458
Don't start crying again.

57:17.291 --> 57:21.000
[horn honking loudly]

57:26.125 --> 57:27.875
See that boy.

57:27.958 --> 57:29.166
What is he doing there?

57:29.250 --> 57:32.083
-What is he doing this time of night?
-Let's go find out.

57:33.708 --> 57:36.208
What are you doing here at this time?

57:36.291 --> 57:37.333
It's so late.

57:37.416 --> 57:39.083
Isn't your mother looking for you?

57:39.166 --> 57:41.375
Where did you come from?

57:41.458 --> 57:44.041
-Get up.
-Get up and go home!

57:44.125 --> 57:45.666
What are you all doing there?

57:45.750 --> 57:47.541
Move out the way. Is that not Ayo?

57:47.625 --> 57:50.583
I said move out of the way!
Or are you deaf?

57:50.666 --> 57:51.958
Get away! Leave him alone.

57:52.833 --> 57:53.916
Ayo.

57:55.125 --> 57:56.833
What are you doing over there?

57:57.875 --> 58:01.000
Your mother has been
looking for you all over the place.

58:01.083 --> 58:02.333
All right. Let's go home.

58:02.416 --> 58:03.541
She'll beat me.

58:03.625 --> 58:06.750
Your mother won't beat you.
Don't worry, let's go home.

58:06.833 --> 58:08.541
Come on.

58:10.083 --> 58:12.750
-[yelling] My life!
-Ayo!

58:12.833 --> 58:17.125
Have mercy on me. Please!

58:17.208 --> 58:20.083
-It's okay.
-Help me get him, Mama Chidi.

58:20.166 --> 58:21.708
God will help.

58:21.791 --> 58:24.791
[Tolani] Excuse me. Excuse me, please.

58:25.333 --> 58:27.791
-[man] Thank you God!
-Ayo!

58:28.708 --> 58:31.833
Where did you find him?!

58:32.750 --> 58:34.416
God, I thank you sir.

58:34.500 --> 58:37.083
Congratulations on the good luck!

58:38.250 --> 58:40.791
-Where did you find him?
-Ask him yourself.

58:40.875 --> 58:42.666
-Ayo!
-[man] Thank you, God!

58:43.375 --> 58:47.125
Thank you, God! Neighbors, thank you.

Yes, Yemi is going closer.

Yes. He stands a chance
and… and… and it's a goal!

[cheering]

59:53.583 --> 59:54.791
Take it.

1:00:14.583 --> 1:00:16.125
-Wait a minute.
-Hmm?

1:00:16.708 --> 1:00:18.958
What kind of business is this exactly?

1:00:22.333 --> 1:00:23.208
Fine.

1:00:24.500 --> 1:00:26.250
Do you remember my friend, Moshood?

1:00:27.833 --> 1:00:28.875
Who?

1:00:30.541 --> 1:00:32.166
Have you forgotten Moshood?

1:00:33.208 --> 1:00:37.083
That man that drives
a Volkswagen Beetle around?

1:00:37.166 --> 1:00:40.416
That's him.
You know he knows a lot of soldiers.

1:00:40.500 --> 1:00:43.875
He imports dogs for them
to protect their homes.

1:00:43.958 --> 1:00:48.416
Dogs like Dobermans, Alsatian, Rottweiler.

1:00:48.500 --> 1:00:51.666
Imported dogs,
not all those local mongrels.

1:00:52.416 --> 1:00:57.166
It's a very profitable venture.
I've done my research.

1:00:57.250 --> 1:01:01.250
In fact, we should triple
the initial investment.

1:01:01.333 --> 1:01:04.583
I can assure you. I've done my research.

1:01:04.666 --> 1:01:07.208
That's good. Give me my money.

1:01:08.083 --> 1:01:12.958
I took my savings from all the hard work
I've been doing since the year started,

1:01:13.666 --> 1:01:15.000
and I gave it to you

1:01:15.083 --> 1:01:18.125
and you're talking to me
about Moshood and dogs?

1:01:18.208 --> 1:01:20.291
I thought you had a real business partner.

1:01:20.375 --> 1:01:21.916
Or a good business plan.

1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:23.708
Give me my money back. Thank you.

1:01:24.708 --> 1:01:25.833
So, you don't even trust me.

1:01:26.791 --> 1:01:29.750
After I told you
I had done all my research.

1:01:29.833 --> 1:01:32.208
Okay. It's not like
I wanted your money before.

1:01:32.291 --> 1:01:33.875
I'm not starving. Take.

1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:37.250
All right, have some patience.
Don't be angry.

1:01:37.333 --> 1:01:39.208
I'm just being cautious.

1:01:39.291 --> 1:01:41.458
This is all my life savings.

1:01:41.541 --> 1:01:43.208
I'm just scared. Don't be angry.

1:01:45.083 --> 1:01:47.750
All right, take.

1:01:49.208 --> 1:01:50.291
Take.

1:01:51.541 --> 1:01:53.125
I trust you.

1:01:54.666 --> 1:01:57.291
Make sure you give me my profit.

1:02:01.083 --> 1:02:05.250
Okay, continue eating. Eat your food.

1:02:05.333 --> 1:02:08.625
Eat. You have too much pride.

1:02:27.375 --> 1:02:29.583
Stop being insolent.
I'm not going anywhere.

1:02:29.666 --> 1:02:31.250
We must finish this discussion.

1:02:31.333 --> 1:02:34.750
Finish what? What gives you the right
to come here and question me?

1:02:34.833 --> 1:02:35.916
Really?

1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:38.291
-My friend, get out.
-What is going on here?

1:02:38.375 --> 1:02:39.416
Tell him to get out.

1:02:39.500 --> 1:02:41.833
I'll go. But not until I say my peace.

1:02:41.916 --> 1:02:44.166
Say what? Leave!

1:02:44.250 --> 1:02:47.375
Is that so?
Your friend? She's not okay. She bit me

1:02:48.416 --> 1:02:51.291
So you don't want to leave?

1:02:51.375 --> 1:02:52.500
[grunts]

1:02:52.583 --> 1:02:53.541
You don't want to leave?

1:02:53.625 --> 1:02:57.208
Ah, look, don't mind her.
I only just told her to be careful of OC.

1:02:57.291 --> 1:02:58.125
Why?

1:02:58.708 --> 1:03:01.541
They had a big fight! It was explosive!

1:03:01.625 --> 1:03:03.458
You should've heard
the things he said.

1:03:03.541 --> 1:03:07.250
Okay, you don't want to leave?
Stay there! Stay there like a soldier.

1:03:07.333 --> 1:03:09.958
You and I will have it out. Stay. Wait.

1:03:10.041 --> 1:03:13.125
Ooh. You two broke up over a year ago,

1:03:13.208 --> 1:03:16.041
and I'm still here settling
your quarrels. I'm surprised.

1:03:16.125 --> 1:03:18.041
You should've heard the things OC said.

1:03:18.125 --> 1:03:20.041
You would be shocked.

1:03:21.083 --> 1:03:22.208
What things?

1:03:22.791 --> 1:03:23.833
Ah.

1:03:26.583 --> 1:03:27.666
Tell me.

1:03:29.833 --> 1:03:33.125
All right, let's put it this way.

1:03:33.208 --> 1:03:37.208
A man cannot respect you,
if he insults you like that.

1:03:37.291 --> 1:03:40.583
What! I can't believe
this is happening, you know.

1:03:40.666 --> 1:03:42.791
I must be dreaming, you know.

1:03:42.875 --> 1:03:44.708
-How dare you talk back, hungry whore!
-No, I--

1:03:44.791 --> 1:03:46.083
What…

1:03:46.166 --> 1:03:47.291
You hungry whore!

1:03:47.375 --> 1:03:50.041
-Did you hear what he called me?
-She's not good in bed.

1:03:50.125 --> 1:03:53.041
She's not good in bed you know!
You can't be compared to my girl

1:03:53.125 --> 1:03:56.000
-Natasha in Chicago!
-I've slept with better men than you!

1:03:56.083 --> 1:03:58.750
You can't be compared
to my girl Amanda in Atlanta!

1:03:58.833 --> 1:04:01.833
-Go back to Atlanta!
-You can't be compared to my girl Aliya

1:04:01.916 --> 1:04:04.250
-What are you doing here?
-You know!

1:04:04.333 --> 1:04:05.708
Babe, talk to your friend.

1:04:05.791 --> 1:04:08.125
I only met OC four years ago
and since that time,

1:04:08.208 --> 1:04:10.125
he's been living in the United States.

1:04:10.208 --> 1:04:12.708
I don't even know what he does there.

1:04:12.791 --> 1:04:16.583
-You said he was your friend!
-Yo! Everyone is my friend.

1:04:17.333 --> 1:04:22.375
-I'm surprised at you Johnny.
-Me? Is that so? She was my girl!

1:04:22.458 --> 1:04:25.250
She's the one that decided
to jump ship and date OC.

1:04:25.333 --> 1:04:26.916
You won't leave!

1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:29.833
-You should stay so I can stab you!
-What is wrong with you?

1:04:29.916 --> 1:04:33.083
-Please leave me! Leave me!
-Ah! What is wrong with you?

1:04:33.166 --> 1:04:37.250
I come in here and both of you
are acting like area boys.

1:04:37.875 --> 1:04:41.791
Nobody cares about Rose.
Every man just wants to use Rose.

1:04:42.583 --> 1:04:45.250
How many things has
Johnny ever bought for me?

1:04:45.333 --> 1:04:48.125
Coming here asking me questions,
monitoring my movement.

1:04:49.083 --> 1:04:50.500
Buy is not love.

1:04:50.583 --> 1:04:51.791
As for OC,

1:04:51.875 --> 1:04:54.208
if he really insults you like that,

1:04:54.291 --> 1:04:56.500
then he does not like you. You hear me?

1:04:56.583 --> 1:04:58.166
He does not like you.

1:04:58.250 --> 1:05:00.416
It's a mistake to be with that man.

1:05:00.500 --> 1:05:02.750
Don't tell me that. I know what I'm doing.

1:05:02.833 --> 1:05:04.458
A mistake is somebody that walks around

1:05:04.541 --> 1:05:06.750
thinking the world
would change because of them.

1:05:06.833 --> 1:05:10.666
Very good. You can do anything you want!

1:05:10.750 --> 1:05:15.416
With whoever you want. In fact,
you can go anywhere with whoever you want.

1:05:15.500 --> 1:05:18.791
But let me remind you,
I live in this house and I pay my rent.

1:05:18.875 --> 1:05:21.833
So if you give me problems,
I will give you problems back!

1:05:21.916 --> 1:05:23.458
I will give you problems back.

1:05:23.541 --> 1:05:25.916
Go, walk away
and don't hear what I'm saying.

1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:27.250
Look at the mess.

1:05:27.333 --> 1:05:29.041
[knocking on door]

1:05:39.250 --> 1:05:42.333
It's true that I don't have
anybody in Lagos to help me.

1:05:43.541 --> 1:05:48.375
But please, if I'm going to work for you,
don't insult me like that again.

1:05:52.416 --> 1:05:53.791
I'm begging you.

1:06:46.541 --> 1:06:49.125
-Miss Tolani Ajao.
-Yes, sir?

1:06:49.208 --> 1:06:53.041
Uh, please,
check that cabinet and get me a file.

1:06:53.125 --> 1:06:54.500
I'm sorry, I cannot, sir.

1:06:56.166 --> 1:06:58.625
-Why not?
-My leg.

1:06:59.208 --> 1:07:05.166
Your leg? What is wrong about your leg?
What happened?

1:07:05.250 --> 1:07:09.000
I fell down on the bus,
and it's paining me, sir.

1:07:09.083 --> 1:07:14.541
Oh. Stop being deceptive. You fell down?

1:07:15.375 --> 1:07:18.916
-You? You fall out from a bus?
-Yes sir.

1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:21.500
And you did not somersault?
You didn't somersault like a monkey?

1:07:22.250 --> 1:07:25.375
-Uh, when was this?
-Today.

1:07:25.458 --> 1:07:26.791
-Today?
-Yes, sir.

1:07:26.875 --> 1:07:28.500
Okay, show me.

1:07:29.791 --> 1:07:32.083
I twisted it, so you cannot see it.

1:07:32.166 --> 1:07:33.791
Show me.

1:07:33.875 --> 1:07:35.708
-This is it, sir.
-Ah.

1:07:36.833 --> 1:07:40.458
You're telling a lie.
It's a lie. You're lying.

1:07:40.541 --> 1:07:43.125
Ah! This thing did not happen today.

1:07:43.208 --> 1:07:45.916
This one did not happen today. Stop lying!

1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:49.625
It's still paining me, sir,
and I cannot bend until it heals.

1:07:49.708 --> 1:07:51.083
-Really?
-Yes, sir.

1:07:51.166 --> 1:07:54.083
All right. Then you take a memo for me.

1:07:54.958 --> 1:07:55.958
Yes, sir.

1:07:57.791 --> 1:08:01.625
I'm going to make you so miserable

1:08:02.125 --> 1:08:06.291
until you'll realize who is the boss,
you worthless thing.

1:08:10.500 --> 1:08:11.791
I'm here, sir.

1:08:15.333 --> 1:08:18.708
To personnel. Regarding Tolani Ajao.

1:08:22.833 --> 1:08:29.291
I wish to lay an official complaint
about my secretary.

1:08:30.625 --> 1:08:32.125
Miss Tolani Ajao.

1:08:34.458 --> 1:08:35.833
This morning,

1:08:36.916 --> 1:08:40.625
I asked her to get me
a file from my cabinet,

1:08:40.708 --> 1:08:42.250
and she refused bluntly.

1:08:43.333 --> 1:08:45.791
She became recalcitrant.

1:08:47.916 --> 1:08:49.333
How do you spell that, sir?

1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:54.291
Check your dictionary, dullard.
Didn't you go to school?

1:08:54.375 --> 1:08:58.000
And when you're asked you're quick
to say you understand English.

1:08:58.083 --> 1:09:01.583
But you don't know
how to spell a simple word.

1:09:01.666 --> 1:09:04.208
Recalcitrant. Ah.

1:09:05.500 --> 1:09:08.750
Make sure you type the memo for me.

1:09:11.833 --> 1:09:13.083
Yes, sir.

1:09:13.666 --> 1:09:16.000
Wait a minute, what do you call yourself?

1:09:16.083 --> 1:09:18.708
Eh? Who do you think you are?

1:09:18.791 --> 1:09:22.083
And you are just a commoner.
An ordinary person.

1:09:23.375 --> 1:09:26.750
-Is that also part of the memo, sir?
-That is your own cup of tea.

1:09:26.833 --> 1:09:30.125
If you don't know.
Write your response for records purposes.

1:09:30.208 --> 1:09:32.083
I will.

1:09:32.166 --> 1:09:36.666
Get out of my sight.
I'll make sure your job is history.

1:09:36.750 --> 1:09:39.958
I'm going to frustrate you.
You worthless thing.

1:09:45.208 --> 1:09:50.125
I notice a missing semicolon
in your response.

1:09:51.541 --> 1:09:53.083
I'll write it in, sir.

1:09:53.916 --> 1:09:55.958
And a misplaced predicate.

1:09:57.208 --> 1:09:59.416
Unfortunately,
you'll have to type it out again.

1:09:59.500 --> 1:10:00.333
Why?

1:10:01.375 --> 1:10:07.000
An employee cannot
amend internal documents by hand.

1:10:08.125 --> 1:10:09.541
If everyone does that,

1:10:09.625 --> 1:10:14.750
then we won't be able to differentiate
the originals from the fakes.

1:10:14.833 --> 1:10:16.833
I'll type it in
if that's what you want, sir.

1:10:19.250 --> 1:10:23.375
At any rate, I cannot
accept this response as it stands.

1:10:25.458 --> 1:10:26.541
Why not?

1:10:31.250 --> 1:10:32.166
Your allegations,

1:10:33.291 --> 1:10:35.208
they're rather… shocking.

1:10:35.291 --> 1:10:38.041
Of course!
What happened to me shocked me too.

1:10:38.125 --> 1:10:41.250
It's unprecedented
and I don't think I…

1:10:41.875 --> 1:10:43.125
I can file it.

1:10:43.208 --> 1:10:44.500
And why not?

1:10:44.583 --> 1:10:47.500
Mr. Salako is a married man.

1:10:47.583 --> 1:10:49.583
Your madam too is a married woman.

1:10:49.666 --> 1:10:52.250
And I've never heard of her
assaulting anyone.

1:10:52.333 --> 1:10:53.500
Look.

1:10:54.291 --> 1:10:59.416
For as long as I've been
supervisor in personnel,

1:11:01.291 --> 1:11:04.916
I have never discussed
this kind of case with her.

1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:11.916
Now, do you realize
the implications of what you're doing?

1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:13.333
Yes.

1:11:15.875 --> 1:11:17.375
All right.

1:11:28.916 --> 1:11:32.458
[Franca] I didn't even see Tolani
standing there. [laughs]

1:11:32.541 --> 1:11:35.708
Ah. So you don't even want
to speak to us any longer.

1:11:37.666 --> 1:11:39.625
Anyway, I understand.

1:11:39.708 --> 1:11:42.250
Anyone asking me now,
"What's happening to Tolani?"

1:11:42.333 --> 1:11:44.666
I just tell them "Leave her alone."

1:11:44.750 --> 1:11:46.666
"She's working for Salako now."

1:11:46.750 --> 1:11:48.958
Ah! And it cannot be easy.

1:11:49.041 --> 1:11:51.375
Ah! You know, learning a new--

1:11:51.458 --> 1:11:53.333
Be quiet! Keep your mouth shut!

1:11:54.458 --> 1:11:55.708
-Me?
-Yes.

1:11:55.791 --> 1:11:58.375
And if you don't keep quiet,
you will end up on this ground.

1:12:00.416 --> 1:12:02.791
-Are you talking to me?
-I'm talking to you.

1:12:02.875 --> 1:12:05.333
Don't say another word,
or you will live to regret it.

1:12:05.416 --> 1:12:07.375
Ah! Show her some respect now.

1:12:07.458 --> 1:12:09.583
Why are you threatening
to fight her in public?

1:12:09.666 --> 1:12:12.208
Hey! Uncle, please,
mind your own business. Okay?

1:12:12.291 --> 1:12:13.208
Mind your business.

1:12:13.291 --> 1:12:16.916
Look, let me tell you,
I'm happy you're all here.

1:12:18.041 --> 1:12:21.083
Listen to me,
because I will not repeat myself.

1:12:21.166 --> 1:12:24.166
Do not speak to me! Do not question me!

1:12:24.250 --> 1:12:27.208
Because I don't owe
any of you any explanation.

1:12:27.291 --> 1:12:28.791
I have filed my report.

1:12:28.875 --> 1:12:32.708
And you people can continue
to spread your stupid rumors.

1:12:32.791 --> 1:12:34.375
-Leave her alone.
-[Tolani] Nonsense.

1:12:34.458 --> 1:12:36.875
Just leave her alone. Look at her.

1:12:36.958 --> 1:12:39.125
Dismissing Ignatius like a little boy.

1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:42.250
God only knows who she's connected to.

1:12:42.333 --> 1:12:44.666
She might open her legs now
and get all of us all fired.

1:12:44.750 --> 1:12:48.708
Eh! You have word. Imagine.
Face in front, let's buy our food.

1:12:48.791 --> 1:12:51.583
Look at them, idiots.

1:12:54.833 --> 1:12:56.750
-I told you she's very wicked.
-Tolani?

1:12:56.833 --> 1:12:59.541
Hey! Can you see for yourself now?

1:12:59.625 --> 1:13:00.750
Imagine.

1:13:01.791 --> 1:13:03.000
Tolani.

1:13:03.083 --> 1:13:06.750
Leave Tolani there. She and Rose,
birds of the same feather.

1:13:06.833 --> 1:13:08.458
So please, let's buy food.

1:13:08.541 --> 1:13:09.541
Tolani!

1:13:09.625 --> 1:13:10.541
What?

1:13:10.625 --> 1:13:12.208
Don't you want to eat anymore?

1:13:12.291 --> 1:13:14.916
-What's your business?
-Oh, you want to fight me too?

1:13:15.583 --> 1:13:16.625
No.

1:13:17.166 --> 1:13:20.583
Why are you so bothered about Franca?
Let me tell you, she's an unhappy woman.

1:13:20.666 --> 1:13:23.041
Her husband beats her every day.

1:13:23.125 --> 1:13:25.666
[chuckles] I'm very happy to hear that.

1:13:25.750 --> 1:13:28.458
How can you say that now?
You should pray for your enemies.

1:13:28.541 --> 1:13:30.458
Why? So that they can destroy me.

1:13:30.541 --> 1:13:31.666
[scoffs]

1:13:31.750 --> 1:13:33.291
I'm sure you don't mean that.

1:13:33.375 --> 1:13:35.541
You're carrying a very heavy burden.

1:13:35.625 --> 1:13:38.291
I'm here to encourage you,
put your trust in the Lord.

1:13:38.375 --> 1:13:39.416
He's forever faithful.

1:13:40.833 --> 1:13:44.125
Anytime you're available,
I want to invite you to my church.

1:13:44.208 --> 1:13:47.083
Me, I'm not interested in going
to any born-again church.

1:13:47.166 --> 1:13:50.166
I'm not interested
in any revival or anything like that

1:13:50.250 --> 1:13:51.833
[laughs]

1:13:51.916 --> 1:13:53.916
I'm just inviting you now.

1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:56.666
As you're seeing me,
my father was an Ifa worshipper.

1:13:58.291 --> 1:14:00.750
Wow. I'm so sorry to hear that.

1:14:00.833 --> 1:14:02.083
Sorry to hear what?

1:14:02.791 --> 1:14:04.583
Nothing, oh. Nothing.

1:14:04.666 --> 1:14:08.458
It's just most people that I know
are either Christians or Muslims.

1:14:08.541 --> 1:14:11.625
Even if they worship
other gods on the side.

1:14:12.791 --> 1:14:15.500
Anyway, my mother is a Christian.

1:14:15.583 --> 1:14:17.416
And I was baptized and confirmed.

1:14:17.500 --> 1:14:20.625
Praise the Lord. That's so beautiful.
I salute you, my sister.

1:14:20.708 --> 1:14:22.916
-I salute you.
-All right, let's go and eat.

1:14:35.208 --> 1:14:38.375
-Ah, Tolani. How are you? Well done.
-Good afternoon. Yes, ma.

1:14:38.458 --> 1:14:43.041
-Listen, I've gotten a new job.
-Thank God.

1:14:43.125 --> 1:14:44.708
It's not easy.

1:14:44.791 --> 1:14:50.166
Bills just keep piling up
and it's all on me.

1:14:50.250 --> 1:14:53.875
Their father doesn't even
try to help out at all.

1:14:53.958 --> 1:14:55.875
He has gambled away all his money.

1:14:55.958 --> 1:15:02.458
And the septic tank fiasco,
I had to pay the landlord to fix it.

1:15:02.541 --> 1:15:06.500
When there's too much to worry about,
the mind is never at peace.

1:15:06.583 --> 1:15:07.916
I'm tired.

1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:11.333
Sorry, ma. You just have to take it easy.
Take it easy.

1:15:11.416 --> 1:15:15.916
-Bye, ma.
-Thank you. These problems are too much.

1:15:20.291 --> 1:15:21.916
[Rose] How was work?

1:15:24.625 --> 1:15:27.083
Ah, I pity the woman.

1:15:28.125 --> 1:15:29.083
Only her.

1:15:29.916 --> 1:15:33.208
Septic tank issue, nurses strike,

1:15:33.291 --> 1:15:35.625
I feel sorry for her.

1:15:35.708 --> 1:15:36.916
What are you cooking?

1:15:37.791 --> 1:15:38.750
Banga.

1:15:38.833 --> 1:15:40.875
Ah-ah. Since when?

1:15:41.541 --> 1:15:42.666
OC likes it.

1:15:43.583 --> 1:15:45.625
[chuckles] Is that his?

1:15:47.458 --> 1:15:49.500
No, I bought it.

1:15:51.333 --> 1:15:52.916
Anyway,

1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:55.166
I'm going to enjoy the fan.

1:15:55.250 --> 1:15:56.625
Enjoy.

1:15:58.250 --> 1:16:00.541
[news theme music playing]

1:16:00.625 --> 1:16:03.208
[announcer]
Good evening, here is the news at nine.

1:16:03.291 --> 1:16:04.708
-The woman…
-Mm!

1:16:06.208 --> 1:16:07.375
This is delicious.

1:16:08.208 --> 1:16:10.833
Mm, it's sweeter than
the previous ones I have made.

1:16:15.250 --> 1:16:19.583
This type of soup will cleanse
your stomach of all the rubbish in it.

1:16:22.125 --> 1:16:25.250
This one will send you
to OC's toilet for one full week.

1:16:26.041 --> 1:16:29.833
At least.
But I won't sweat when I'm there.

1:16:29.916 --> 1:16:31.625
The heat won't kill me in there.

1:16:32.833 --> 1:16:34.291
Ah, this is delicious.

1:16:36.125 --> 1:16:37.250
How is Sanwo?

1:16:38.125 --> 1:16:39.541
He traveled up north.

1:16:39.625 --> 1:16:44.166
Your man travels a lot.
Mm. He travels a lot.

1:16:45.000 --> 1:16:46.250
How is work?

1:16:48.666 --> 1:16:50.791
-Fine.
-Hm, and Salako?

1:16:56.125 --> 1:16:58.666
Ah. Is it that bad?

1:17:05.458 --> 1:17:08.750
Didn't I tell you? I told you right?

1:17:08.833 --> 1:17:11.666
Archibong reports to Salako,
so she can't challenge him.

1:17:11.750 --> 1:17:13.708
That's why I never bothered reporting.

1:17:16.166 --> 1:17:19.250
I'm sure she's thrown
your report away without reading it.

1:17:20.125 --> 1:17:21.250
I've told you already.

1:17:21.333 --> 1:17:24.666
And nothing will change
until you and I change it.

1:17:26.958 --> 1:17:27.958
How?

1:17:35.833 --> 1:17:37.125
OC, uh…

1:17:39.166 --> 1:17:41.125
-OC.
-Hmm.

1:17:41.208 --> 1:17:43.625
-He smuggles drugs into America.
-[gasps]

1:17:43.708 --> 1:17:45.000
Shh! Don't shout.

1:17:45.083 --> 1:17:48.291
Calm down, Just listen.
That's how he made his money.

1:17:50.666 --> 1:17:52.166
-Are you listening?
-Ah!

1:17:52.250 --> 1:17:54.250
No, he doesn't do it himself.

1:17:54.333 --> 1:17:58.166
He uses girls like me and you.
Do you understand?

1:17:58.250 --> 1:18:02.916
We'll swallow the drugs, and he'll arrange
the travel plans for us to go overseas.

1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:04.916
We go and come back.

1:18:05.500 --> 1:18:06.458
Do you understand?

1:18:06.541 --> 1:18:11.750
And he pays us. Just one trip
and he will pay us 1,500 dollars.

1:18:12.958 --> 1:18:14.250
I'm not ashamed.

1:18:15.958 --> 1:18:19.583
I'm not ashamed.
You know what shames me? Poverty.

1:18:19.666 --> 1:18:22.125
And it should shame you too.

1:18:22.833 --> 1:18:25.333
I am tired of being poor. I am tired.

1:18:26.375 --> 1:18:29.083
You stay in a compound
where everywhere smells of shit.

1:18:29.166 --> 1:18:33.416
You get on a bus and everyone
on it smells of… I don't know.

1:18:33.500 --> 1:18:36.500
Then you go to the office,
and there's a stinking useless man

1:18:36.583 --> 1:18:38.208
who touches you everywhere.

1:18:38.291 --> 1:18:42.250
No. I am tired and I'm done. I'm done.

1:18:42.333 --> 1:18:45.083
Rose, Salako or OC?

1:18:45.166 --> 1:18:46.250
Mm-hmm?

1:18:47.125 --> 1:18:48.125
Okay.

1:18:49.250 --> 1:18:54.333
I know that Salako is an oaf,
but that OC is a dangerous man!

1:18:54.416 --> 1:18:55.708
He didn't force me.

1:18:56.250 --> 1:18:58.750
I made up my mind by myself,
he didn't force me.

1:18:59.333 --> 1:19:02.916
I don't want to hear it. And I'm not poor.

1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:05.708
You're poor, my sister. You're very poor.

1:19:05.791 --> 1:19:09.708
You're poor. All of us are poor,
you're just too proud to admit it.

1:19:09.791 --> 1:19:13.500
If you want to do anything you like,
you can do it.

1:19:14.125 --> 1:19:17.833
Me, I don't take risks with my body.

1:19:17.916 --> 1:19:21.958
Wait, do you think that I, Rose,
that I want to die?

1:19:22.041 --> 1:19:26.583
So, the people that are dying,
they die for no reason?

1:19:27.333 --> 1:19:31.041
[laughs] They're very careless,
that's why they're dying.

1:19:31.125 --> 1:19:33.875
How can you be careful,
if you're swallowing drugs?

1:19:34.958 --> 1:19:39.708
Tolani, I've done my research.
I've done all the research. You won't die.

1:19:39.791 --> 1:19:42.916
You wrap the drugs well. Tight.

1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:47.041
Then you make sure you don't eat or drink.
People do it every day.

1:19:47.125 --> 1:19:50.500
-Come and go back to where you came from.
-I wasn't supposed to tell you.

1:19:50.583 --> 1:19:53.416
But if you change your mind,
you know where to find me.

1:19:54.416 --> 1:19:57.458
Just don't come back.
Mischief maker. Ah-ah!

[soccer announcer on radio]
Oh, what a day it has been.

1:20:01.041 --> 1:20:03.208
This has been a disappointing end

1:20:03.291 --> 1:20:08.708
to the match between Nigeria
and Saudi Arabia with a nil - nil draw.

1:20:08.791 --> 1:20:13.291
As you can see the Golden Eaglets
are looking very unhappy at the moment,

1:20:13.375 --> 1:20:17.833
and their faces are down.
But we know that the tournament…

1:20:34.708 --> 1:20:35.833
Good afternoon, ma.

1:20:37.041 --> 1:20:38.083

1:20:55.916 --> 1:20:58.166
-Good afternoon.
-I'm looking for Sanwo.

1:20:58.250 --> 1:20:59.333
His room is there.

1:20:59.416 --> 1:21:00.625
-There?
-Yes.

1:21:29.083 --> 1:21:30.916
Really? I didn't know you were back.

1:21:31.000 --> 1:21:33.708
-Tolani.
-What is happening?

1:21:33.791 --> 1:21:35.875
I don't want that woman
to know I'm home.

1:21:35.958 --> 1:21:37.458
What is wrong? What happened?

1:21:37.541 --> 1:21:40.416
She'll start asking what
I went to do in the north.

1:21:41.750 --> 1:21:42.875
When did you get back?

1:21:44.958 --> 1:21:46.041
Two days ago.

1:21:46.125 --> 1:21:49.208
Ah! Sanwo. And you didn't call me.

1:21:49.291 --> 1:21:51.208
I don't have a phone to use.

1:21:51.291 --> 1:21:54.750
When has that ever stopped you?
Or are you hiding from me?

1:21:54.833 --> 1:21:56.916
Why would I be hiding from you?

1:21:57.000 --> 1:22:00.041
I hear you.
So, you were staying at Moshood?

1:22:00.958 --> 1:22:02.541
Where else would I have stayed?

1:22:02.625 --> 1:22:04.916
Or was it at Miriam's or Miriamu?

1:22:06.166 --> 1:22:07.958
Tolani, what kind of talk is that?

1:22:08.041 --> 1:22:10.125
Okay, I hear you. Where is my money?

1:22:13.125 --> 1:22:14.375
What happened?

1:22:14.458 --> 1:22:16.666
Why do you look like that?
Where's my money?

1:22:17.333 --> 1:22:20.041
Why are you shaking?
Where is my money? What is wrong?

1:22:20.708 --> 1:22:22.333
-Um, Tolani.
-Somebody help me.

-Sanwo. I'm in trouble.

1:22:25.000 --> 1:22:26.416
Let me explain it to you.

1:22:26.500 --> 1:22:28.416
-I should be patient?
-I'll explain it.

1:22:28.500 --> 1:22:30.375
-Fine. I'm listening.
-Let me explain.

1:22:30.458 --> 1:22:33.291
Explain. Where is my money, Sanwo?

1:22:33.375 --> 1:22:34.833
I can't pay you your money.

1:22:34.916 --> 1:22:36.041
Hey!

1:22:36.625 --> 1:22:37.666
Sanwo.

1:22:40.375 --> 1:22:42.833
Tolani… I lost the money.

1:22:42.916 --> 1:22:44.333
You lost the money.

1:22:44.875 --> 1:22:47.333
Tolani,
when Moshood and I got to the place,

1:22:47.416 --> 1:22:48.250
Eh!

1:22:48.333 --> 1:22:51.458
they brought out the dog cages.
But there were no dogs in them.

1:22:51.541 --> 1:22:54.083
-Where were the dogs?
-I wanted to run after the man,

1:22:54.875 --> 1:22:57.916
but Moshood said we didn't
have the proper documentation so…

1:22:59.500 --> 1:23:01.916
Tolani, please. Please, don't be angry.

1:23:02.750 --> 1:23:08.166
I remember you warned me.
Tolani, I was duped.

1:23:08.250 --> 1:23:11.041
You were duped?
Of course, you were duped.

1:23:11.125 --> 1:23:14.458
If you had used the eyes in your head

1:23:14.541 --> 1:23:17.125
then you would've realized
that Moshood and that man

1:23:17.208 --> 1:23:19.458
worked together to scam you.

1:23:19.541 --> 1:23:22.375
And you're standing here
telling me that they…

1:23:22.458 --> 1:23:24.041
-Give me my money!
-Tolani.

1:23:24.708 --> 1:23:28.291
-Give me my money! Sanwo!
-Tolani. Tolani, please

1:23:29.125 --> 1:23:32.875
I'm using God as my witness,
I'll pay you back your money.

1:23:32.958 --> 1:23:34.125
God as your witness?

1:23:34.208 --> 1:23:37.333
I use God as my witness
that today is the last time you see me.

1:23:37.416 --> 1:23:40.625
Tolani, please. Tolani. Wait.

1:23:40.708 --> 1:23:45.750
Don't let her-- Don't let her hear.
Tolani, please. Tolani.

1:23:46.791 --> 1:23:49.125
Tolani, I'll return your money to you. Eh?

1:23:50.625 --> 1:23:54.583
Tolani. Please now.
Be patient. Don't let her…

1:23:55.333 --> 1:23:59.208

Your boss needs serious prayers.

1:36:56.291 --> 1:36:57.708
When does this service end?

1:36:58.791 --> 1:36:59.916
It's just two hours.

1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:01.166
Two!

1:37:08.958 --> 1:37:10.083
Hallelujah!

1:37:10.166 --> 1:37:11.416
[all] Amen!

1:37:11.500 --> 1:37:14.416
If you're happy to be in the presence
of the Lord, say hallelujah!

1:37:14.500 --> 1:37:17.458
[all] Hallelujah!

1:37:20.541 --> 1:37:22.166
[man] Hallelujah!

1:37:24.916 --> 1:37:26.125
My God is good.

1:37:26.208 --> 1:37:27.458
[all] All the time!

1:37:27.541 --> 1:37:29.291
All right, can we sit down?

1:37:31.833 --> 1:37:33.333
Father said to me…

1:37:35.125 --> 1:37:37.875
He said, "Fred, look at yourself."

1:37:37.958 --> 1:37:40.666
"Do you think it's because
you're so special,

1:37:40.750 --> 1:37:44.166
that you have been so blessed
that you fly first class?"

1:37:44.250 --> 1:37:46.333
[cheering]

1:37:46.916 --> 1:37:52.208
The secret to prosperity,
you don't need to go to worship some God.

1:37:52.291 --> 1:37:54.583
Just follow the rules of the law.

1:37:54.666 --> 1:37:57.166
-Hallelujah!
-Amen!

1:37:57.250 --> 1:38:01.625
If we turn our Bible to Acts 4:12.

1:38:01.708 --> 1:38:03.708
It says salvation!

1:38:03.791 --> 1:38:05.583
I didn't say it.

1:38:05.666 --> 1:38:08.958
The Holy Bible says salvation

1:38:09.041 --> 1:38:12.833
is found in no one else except who?

1:38:12.916 --> 1:38:15.458
-[all] Jesus Christ!
-[pastor] Jesus Christ! Amen!

1:38:15.541 --> 1:38:18.083
-[all] Amen!
-[woman] Amen, pastor!

1:38:18.166 --> 1:38:19.708
[man] Jesus!

1:38:19.791 --> 1:38:21.958
[yells indistinctly]

1:38:22.041 --> 1:38:23.000
Jesus!

1:38:23.083 --> 1:38:26.416
In the Book of John 14, and he says,

1:38:27.333 --> 1:38:31.083
"I am the way, the truth…"

1:38:33.958 --> 1:38:35.083
Good morning, Father.

1:38:35.166 --> 1:38:38.000
Ah, good morning. Did you sleep well?

1:38:38.083 --> 1:38:39.125
Yes, Father.

1:38:39.208 --> 1:38:40.958
What are you dressed up for?

1:38:41.041 --> 1:38:42.500
We're going to church.

1:38:42.583 --> 1:38:44.083
You're going to church?

1:38:44.166 --> 1:38:46.125
You've started following them to church?

1:38:46.208 --> 1:38:48.125
-Yes.
-[chuckles]

1:38:49.375 --> 1:38:51.416
Ah. [laughs]

1:38:51.916 --> 1:38:56.000
That's fine.
Let me just make one thing clear to you.

1:38:56.083 --> 1:38:59.583
I don't want you to tell your mother,
do you understand?

1:38:59.666 --> 1:39:00.625
Yes, Father.

1:39:00.708 --> 1:39:02.458
If you have any problems,

1:39:03.958 --> 1:39:06.291
you should pray to Orunmila.

1:39:06.375 --> 1:39:08.375
Orunmila is the spirit of wisdom.

1:39:09.708 --> 1:39:16.500
All the deities that God created,
were created to help us.

1:39:16.583 --> 1:39:19.166
You see, Sango and Ogun,

1:39:19.750 --> 1:39:26.541
they are deities who help
give all men strength and courage.

1:39:27.125 --> 1:39:32.083
And you see Yemoja, ah,
she's a compassionate woman.

1:39:32.166 --> 1:39:36.166
Then you see the deity called Osun.

1:39:37.083 --> 1:39:38.791
Ah, she's the deity for children.

1:39:39.958 --> 1:39:45.041
She's the deity for plentiful children.
Anybody that's infertile, prays to Osun.

1:39:45.125 --> 1:39:47.583
Keep it in mind,
I don't want you to forget.

1:39:49.166 --> 1:39:52.791
Jesus loves us so much. He gave his life!

1:39:53.583 --> 1:39:55.625
So that you and I can survive.

1:39:55.708 --> 1:40:02.333
But he asks for nothing,
except this token, offering and tithe.

1:40:03.041 --> 1:40:07.416
If you do that, you're gonna
start flying first class, amen!

1:40:07.500 --> 1:40:09.625
[all] Amen!

1:40:09.708 --> 1:40:12.125
You are gonna build that mansion tomorrow!

1:40:12.208 --> 1:40:13.666
Amen!

1:40:14.333 --> 1:40:17.166
You're gonna be driving a Mercedes Benz.

1:40:17.250 --> 1:40:18.291
Amen!

1:40:20.291 --> 1:40:23.666
If you wanna have all that,
tell your brother, say I am blessed.

1:40:23.750 --> 1:40:25.458
[all] I am blessed!

1:40:30.708 --> 1:40:31.541
Tolani!

1:40:35.875 --> 1:40:36.958
What now?

1:40:37.708 --> 1:40:38.875
I'm sorry.

1:40:38.958 --> 1:40:41.041
It's okay. You are just overcome.

1:40:42.583 --> 1:40:45.166
I'm not. I'm just tired.
I want to go home.

1:40:45.250 --> 1:40:46.458
Home, why?

1:40:47.416 --> 1:40:49.208
Your pastor is brainwashing you.

1:40:49.291 --> 1:40:53.875
Every Sunday you sit there and
listen to him say all sorts of nonsense.

1:40:53.958 --> 1:40:55.458
He's already rich.

1:40:55.541 --> 1:40:58.208
But you're still giving him your money.
How does that make any sense?

1:40:58.833 --> 1:41:00.375
That's not for me to question.

1:41:00.458 --> 1:41:03.750
Godwin, it is.
That's why God gave you a brain.

1:41:03.833 --> 1:41:06.458
Ah! It's already good enough
that you're a Christian,

1:41:06.541 --> 1:41:08.708
but why must you… I saw you there!

1:41:08.791 --> 1:41:10.500
Pretending to speak in tongues.

1:41:10.583 --> 1:41:13.000
Why? As if it's not bad enough,

1:41:13.083 --> 1:41:16.958
he's still condemning everybody else's
faith and saying one way is the only way.

1:41:17.041 --> 1:41:18.958
Why? Look, me, I'm going home.

1:41:20.125 --> 1:41:20.958
Bitch!

1:41:40.541 --> 1:41:41.666
I can't do it.

1:41:42.333 --> 1:41:43.416
Hm?

1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:47.208
Rose, I cannot do it.

1:41:47.291 --> 1:41:48.958
-Do what?
-[sighs]

1:41:52.333 --> 1:41:55.833
I can't do it.
Number one, I cannot swallow.

1:41:55.916 --> 1:41:58.833
Ah-ah. Did you repent or what is it?

1:41:59.625 --> 1:42:01.041
Number two,

1:42:02.125 --> 1:42:04.000
I must have been crazy

1:42:04.875 --> 1:42:07.000
to thought about doing
something like that.

1:42:07.083 --> 1:42:08.791
Over my mother's dead body.

1:42:08.875 --> 1:42:12.083
Never would I hide drugs
inside my stomach.

1:42:12.583 --> 1:42:17.166
I would not jump on a plane,
and go and shit it out abroad.

1:42:17.250 --> 1:42:19.750
Never. I cannot do it.

1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:22.333
I cannot.

1:42:22.416 --> 1:42:24.875
-I had a revelation in that church.
-Hmm.

1:42:24.958 --> 1:42:29.916
People at the top will always take
advantage of people like you and me.

1:42:30.791 --> 1:42:33.208
Look at us.
We are working for an organization

1:42:33.291 --> 1:42:35.916
that does not care about you or me.

1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:39.166
I cannot do this. Never.

1:42:39.250 --> 1:42:40.958
-Ah, Tolani.
-I cannot.

1:42:41.041 --> 1:42:45.208
It seems like this poverty
is making you crazy.

1:42:45.875 --> 1:42:48.166
See how you're
behaving like you're possessed.

1:42:48.250 --> 1:42:51.041
For weeks now,
you've been back and forth. What is it?

1:42:51.125 --> 1:42:53.916
Look, I don't care about OC.

1:42:54.833 --> 1:42:57.250
It is you Rose that I'm concerned for.

1:42:57.333 --> 1:43:00.750
Yet you're backing
out of the plan we both made.

1:43:00.833 --> 1:43:03.208
He will find somebody else. Eh?

1:43:03.291 --> 1:43:06.833
Just like he found you.
He will find somebody else.

1:43:13.708 --> 1:43:16.000
Don't go. Eh?

1:43:18.541 --> 1:43:20.333
It's not worth it.

1:43:20.416 --> 1:43:22.041
[gentle music playing]

1:43:22.125 --> 1:43:23.041
Rose.

1:43:23.833 --> 1:43:26.125
We will find another job. You will see.

1:43:26.208 --> 1:43:28.625
What job? What job?

1:43:29.791 --> 1:43:32.708
Do you know what
that bastard called me?

1:43:32.791 --> 1:43:33.958
A nobody.

1:43:34.041 --> 1:43:36.666
-But he called me a commoner too.
-Ooh.

1:43:37.250 --> 1:43:38.541
And you think that idiot

1:43:38.625 --> 1:43:41.750
would write us a reference letter
to look for another job?

1:44:39.833 --> 1:44:42.625
[suspenseful music playing]

1:45:10.083 --> 1:45:11.750
-What is this?
-Salako.

1:45:11.833 --> 1:45:13.541
Salako!

1:45:13.625 --> 1:45:16.166
-Salako!
-What is wrong with you?

1:45:16.250 --> 1:45:19.291
How many times did I call you?
You have offended my creator,

1:45:19.375 --> 1:45:21.625
and you've also offended
my dead father's creator.

1:45:22.458 --> 1:45:28.291
The gods are now ready to give you
the punishment you deserve.

1:45:28.375 --> 1:45:33.250
The gods are ready
to wreak havoc in your life.

1:45:33.333 --> 1:45:35.750
What is wrong with this girl,
for God's sake?

1:45:35.833 --> 1:45:37.875
I will take my leave next week.

1:45:37.958 --> 1:45:40.958
-Can you get out before I--
-And you will not sack me!

1:45:41.041 --> 1:45:46.083
If you sack me,
your job will be in jeopardy.

1:45:46.166 --> 1:45:49.458
Your first male son will run mad.

1:45:49.541 --> 1:45:50.791
You are in trouble!

1:45:50.875 --> 1:45:53.916
Your female child will get raped.

1:45:54.000 --> 1:45:55.958
She will get pregnant too.

1:45:56.041 --> 1:45:58.750
-You're unwell.
-She'll give birth to a bastard.

1:45:58.833 --> 1:46:02.375
-You'll get pregnant as well.
-As for the remaining children you have,

1:46:02.458 --> 1:46:06.250
any one of them
that is still in school won't finish.

1:46:06.333 --> 1:46:09.250
And if they have finished,
they will become aimless.

1:46:09.333 --> 1:46:11.083
-Abomination!
-So shall it be.

1:46:11.166 --> 1:46:13.208
In the name of Jesus it won't-- Jesus!

1:46:13.291 --> 1:46:16.250
Witch! Spirit child!

1:46:17.333 --> 1:46:23.166
Hey! Somebody help me, she'll kill me.
Where are my glasses?

1:46:26.666 --> 1:46:29.791
Ah! Unfortunate person. Witch!

1:46:49.083 --> 1:46:50.000
Morning.

1:46:55.041 --> 1:46:56.250
[Tolani] He's busy.

1:46:57.166 --> 1:46:58.416
But I need to see him.

1:46:59.166 --> 1:47:00.875
I said he's busy.

1:47:00.958 --> 1:47:03.500
He personally asked me to see him.

1:47:03.583 --> 1:47:06.125
And he told me
he doesn't want to see anybody.

1:47:06.208 --> 1:47:09.166
So I can't go inside.
Is that what you're saying?

1:47:10.333 --> 1:47:11.375
Is it?

1:47:12.291 --> 1:47:13.291
Okay.

1:47:13.791 --> 1:47:15.000
[scoffs]

1:47:21.416 --> 1:47:24.083
-Yes?
-Sir, it's Tolani, sir.

1:47:24.166 --> 1:47:26.208
Miss Franca is here to see you.

1:47:26.291 --> 1:47:29.750
Sir, it's pertaining to
the meeting we had yesterday.

1:47:29.833 --> 1:47:34.375
Tell her I'll see her tomorrow.
Um, thank you, Miss Ajao.

1:47:39.166 --> 1:47:41.166
[playful music]

1:47:43.958 --> 1:47:44.791
Mm.

1:47:44.875 --> 1:47:46.625
[chuckles]

1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:13.250
I'm sorry.

1:48:23.750 --> 1:48:25.916
I'm the only one who would talk to you.

1:48:27.041 --> 1:48:28.458
So you pitied me?

1:48:29.666 --> 1:48:30.708
No.

1:48:31.458 --> 1:48:32.875
I misjudged your character.

1:48:33.791 --> 1:48:34.958
I'm sorry.

1:48:38.458 --> 1:48:41.291
Anyway, Jesus still loves you.

1:48:45.666 --> 1:48:46.708
Okay.

1:48:47.375 --> 1:48:48.833
What is he still doing there?

1:48:50.083 --> 1:48:51.666
Maybe he's deliberating.

1:48:52.625 --> 1:48:53.791
Still?

1:48:55.291 --> 1:48:59.208
[announcer on radio] We were never
expected to make it this far but we have,

1:48:59.291 --> 1:49:02.083
by virtue of our skill and athleticism.

1:49:03.166 --> 1:49:07.250
He has won. He dribbles and it's…
and it's and it's in.

1:49:07.333 --> 1:49:09.875
And it's a goal!

1:49:09.958 --> 1:49:13.541
[all cheering]

1:49:17.833 --> 1:49:21.958
[Rose] Ah-ah! Tolani!
I can't believe this is you.

1:49:23.666 --> 1:49:24.666
You!

1:49:26.375 --> 1:49:28.625
You're worse than FIFA fans.

1:49:31.083 --> 1:49:32.375
My dear, I had to do it.

1:49:32.458 --> 1:49:34.500
If not he won't have let me go.

1:49:34.583 --> 1:49:38.916
True. It's good. He's overbearing.

1:49:39.000 --> 1:49:40.458
Too much.

1:49:47.625 --> 1:49:49.500
Maybe I should
report you to the authorities,

1:49:49.583 --> 1:49:51.625
so that they can stop you at the airport.

1:49:51.708 --> 1:49:53.125
Which authorities?

1:49:53.708 --> 1:49:55.708
Same people that are behind it.

1:49:55.791 --> 1:49:58.083
-Hmm!
-Go and report.

1:49:58.166 --> 1:50:00.500
-[laughs]
-I'll report you too.

1:50:00.583 --> 1:50:03.041
After all, you were a part of it
before you pulled out.

1:50:03.125 --> 1:50:04.000
Uh-huh!

1:50:04.500 --> 1:50:06.291
[laughs]

1:50:06.375 --> 1:50:08.291
-I'm no longer scared.
-Rose.

1:50:09.916 --> 1:50:12.708
At least I'm not going to America,
I'm going to England.

1:50:13.583 --> 1:50:15.333
There you just plead guilty.

1:50:15.416 --> 1:50:18.541
They'll put you in prison
and give you a small sentence.

1:50:18.625 --> 1:50:20.500
You serve your time, the end.

1:50:21.208 --> 1:50:23.375
But in America, ah…

1:50:24.333 --> 1:50:28.333
They throw you in a cell,
where they can sexually harass you.

1:50:28.416 --> 1:50:29.666
[Tolani] Eh?

1:50:29.750 --> 1:50:31.250
God forbid.

1:50:33.125 --> 1:50:36.375
I hear that in Bangkok,
they throw them inside dungeons.

1:50:36.458 --> 1:50:38.541
Ah. They are worse than Africans.

1:50:39.125 --> 1:50:40.791
Eh! And as for the Arabs.

1:50:40.875 --> 1:50:43.000
Eh! Don't go near those ones.

1:50:43.083 --> 1:50:47.291
-They'll just behead you. Very strict.
-[Tolani laughs]

1:50:47.375 --> 1:50:50.208
I'm shocked. This is serious.

1:50:53.541 --> 1:50:55.083
[Tolani sighs]

1:50:55.166 --> 1:50:59.458
My sister, please forgive me
for what I did the other day.

1:51:00.041 --> 1:51:03.666
-You know, my life.
-Hm.

1:51:03.750 --> 1:51:05.083
[gentle music playing]

1:51:05.166 --> 1:51:07.166
The things I've seen.

1:51:07.250 --> 1:51:10.416
The disappointment, everything, just…

1:51:11.750 --> 1:51:14.958
Just makes me behave
irrationally sometimes.

1:51:15.625 --> 1:51:17.000
[sighs]

1:51:20.583 --> 1:51:21.750
So, I'm sorry.

1:51:24.708 --> 1:51:28.250
[gentle music rising]

1:52:08.375 --> 1:52:09.458
[knocking]

1:52:09.541 --> 1:52:12.541
[snoring]

1:52:24.500 --> 1:52:27.583
[dramatic music rising gently]

1:52:27.666 --> 1:52:29.916
[indistinct PA announcement]

1:52:55.125 --> 1:52:56.250
[knocking]

1:52:58.125 --> 1:52:59.958
[knocking continues]

1:53:00.041 --> 1:53:00.916
Uh-huh.

1:53:01.000 --> 1:53:03.250
Tolani, enter now. Come in.

1:53:03.333 --> 1:53:04.750
Mama Chidi, good afternoon.

1:53:04.833 --> 1:53:06.958
-Sit down. Welcome.
-Thank you.

1:53:07.541 --> 1:53:09.041
-How are you?
-I'm fine.

1:53:09.125 --> 1:53:10.666
You didn't go to church?

1:53:10.750 --> 1:53:11.958
No, ma, I didn't.

1:53:12.041 --> 1:53:14.541
We have gone to Sunday mass
and we are back.

1:53:14.625 --> 1:53:17.541
The children have eaten.
Even I have eaten too.

1:53:17.625 --> 1:53:19.208
They're sleeping.

1:53:19.291 --> 1:53:22.166
But Papa Chidi went to watch FIFA final.

1:53:22.250 --> 1:53:24.708
Ooh. I have not been following.

1:53:24.791 --> 1:53:27.125
Have you been following the matches?

1:53:27.208 --> 1:53:29.708
No. I don't have time.

1:53:29.791 --> 1:53:32.875
Mm. Okay. Um…

1:53:32.958 --> 1:53:34.750
Rose has traveled.

1:53:34.833 --> 1:53:39.041
And I'm thinking of going
to my hometown next week.

1:53:39.125 --> 1:53:40.875
Really? I hope all is well?

1:53:40.958 --> 1:53:43.375
-Yes, all is well, Mama Chidi. Thank you.
-Okay.

1:53:43.458 --> 1:53:47.375
So I wanted to ask you
to please help us watch our place,

1:53:47.458 --> 1:53:48.916
'till I come back.

1:53:49.000 --> 1:53:50.500
I'm not going for long.

1:53:50.583 --> 1:53:51.666
-Really?
-Yes.

1:53:51.750 --> 1:53:54.291
-How long are you gone?
-Only one week.

1:53:54.375 --> 1:53:56.458
-Only one week. Okay.
-Just-- Yes.

1:53:56.541 --> 1:53:58.500
-Please when you go, rest. Mm?
-I will.

1:53:58.583 --> 1:54:00.000
-Safe journey.
-Thank you.

1:54:00.083 --> 1:54:02.583
-Please, rest well.
-I will.

1:54:02.666 --> 1:54:05.166
Let me leave you to read your newspaper.

1:54:05.250 --> 1:54:06.708
No, it's just newspaper.

1:54:06.791 --> 1:54:08.583
But eh, my sister,

1:54:08.666 --> 1:54:11.458
this drug thing
is becoming very serious.

1:54:11.541 --> 1:54:14.458
Everybody is carrying drugs,
wanting to be rich.

1:54:14.541 --> 1:54:15.791
Now, now, now, now.

1:54:15.875 --> 1:54:19.541
They can't wait for God to bless them.
Because they want big, big money.

1:54:19.625 --> 1:54:21.833
-Ah. Thank you very much, ma.
-Mm. Okay.

1:54:21.916 --> 1:54:23.125
-Rest.
-Yes. Thank you.

1:54:23.208 --> 1:54:26.791
Don't overwork yourself
and forget to take care of yourself.

1:54:27.625 --> 1:54:32.500
[announcer] Oh, what a moment
at the finals against the Germans.

1:54:32.583 --> 1:54:34.291
As you can see…

1:54:42.500 --> 1:54:45.083
Here they go again. Passing the ball.

1:54:45.166 --> 1:54:49.041
Yes, he moved it to Joseph Babatunde.

1:54:49.125 --> 1:54:51.416
Oh, my goodness.
Yes! Nearly! Going closer!

1:54:51.500 --> 1:54:55.291
He stands a chance. And, it's a goal!

1:54:55.375 --> 1:54:57.708
[all cheering]

1:54:57.791 --> 1:55:00.458
Beautiful one by the Golden Eaglets!

1:55:00.541 --> 1:55:01.958
Oh, what a game!

1:55:03.583 --> 1:55:05.458
[door creaks]

1:55:13.083 --> 1:55:15.625
[chilling music playing]

1:55:24.166 --> 1:55:26.125
[shushes]

1:55:26.208 --> 1:55:29.291
-Be still. Still. Hey!
-[gasping]

1:55:29.375 --> 1:55:32.750
I'll kill you. I'll kill you.
Be still, be still.

1:55:32.833 --> 1:55:35.875
[shushes]

1:55:35.958 --> 1:55:37.208
Good.

1:55:38.583 --> 1:55:41.500
Are you listening? Are you listening?

1:55:43.416 --> 1:55:44.333
[gasps]

1:55:44.416 --> 1:55:46.500
Your friend is dead.

1:55:46.583 --> 1:55:49.833
Shh! Be still! I want you to disappear.

1:55:49.916 --> 1:55:52.375
Go to wherever you like, I don't care.

1:55:52.458 --> 1:55:55.583
Just get out of here before daybreak.

1:55:55.666 --> 1:55:58.125
[crying] What happened to Rose?

1:56:14.958 --> 1:56:16.416
Are you okay?

1:56:20.333 --> 1:56:21.833
What's the problem?

1:56:21.916 --> 1:56:25.125
[uneasy music playing]

1:56:25.208 --> 1:56:27.166
Do you want me to call the hostess?

1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:35.625
[dramatic music playing]

1:56:57.208 --> 1:56:59.208
Burst bags.

1:56:59.291 --> 1:57:00.833
[sobs]

1:57:00.916 --> 1:57:03.166
She was a bad investment.

1:57:04.000 --> 1:57:06.458
-Shh!
-She was someone's daugh--

1:57:06.541 --> 1:57:08.875
Don't even! Don't. Don't try it.

1:57:08.958 --> 1:57:11.666
If you're looking for someone to blame,
blame yourself!

1:57:11.750 --> 1:57:13.833
You put too much doubt in her mind.

1:57:13.916 --> 1:57:16.208
Damn! You caused everything you know!

1:57:16.291 --> 1:57:18.416
Hey! Shh. Shut up! Shut up.

1:57:18.500 --> 1:57:21.958
Get out of this place by daybreak.

1:57:22.041 --> 1:57:25.708
If I come back and meet you here,
you're dead meat.

1:57:26.500 --> 1:57:27.625
Dead meat!

1:57:30.208 --> 1:57:32.250
[sobs]

1:57:32.333 --> 1:57:35.291
[dramatic music playing]

1:57:37.250 --> 1:57:38.500
[sobbing]

1:57:38.583 --> 1:57:41.541
Rose. [sobs]

1:57:48.083 --> 1:57:51.291
And I warned you, Rose.

1:57:54.291 --> 1:57:58.208
I warned you.

1:58:04.166 --> 1:58:06.625
It took death for you to open up, Tolani.

1:58:06.708 --> 1:58:09.666
Eh? All by yourself.

1:58:09.750 --> 1:58:12.041
Facing all these difficulties.

1:58:12.125 --> 1:58:15.250
You should've come home. Hmm?

1:58:16.041 --> 1:58:20.291
Are you scared of your home?
Do you have another mother?

1:58:20.375 --> 1:58:22.708
[sniffles] Mommy…

1:58:24.041 --> 1:58:28.125
You've taught me, and you made sure
I can stand on my own.

1:58:28.208 --> 1:58:30.083
Not in this kind of situation.

1:58:30.166 --> 1:58:33.541
Not when you're suffering,
not when you're hungry.

1:58:33.625 --> 1:58:36.750
Look, right now,
I'll boil some herbs for you.

1:58:36.833 --> 1:58:38.833
For you bathe with and drink. Yes.

1:58:39.458 --> 1:58:41.541
-Herbs?
-Yes, herbs.

1:58:41.625 --> 1:58:45.000
Can you see all that hollowness
in your neck? It will fill up.

1:58:45.083 --> 1:58:49.875
Let me quickly go make it.
Go in and change.

1:58:49.958 --> 1:58:51.041
I hear you.

1:58:51.125 --> 1:58:52.958
May I never be unfortunate.

1:59:01.166 --> 1:59:02.625
-Good morning, ma.
-My dear.

1:59:02.708 --> 1:59:03.666
Happy selling.

1:59:03.750 --> 1:59:04.958
May you make sales.

1:59:05.041 --> 1:59:06.791
-You too.
-Thanks!

1:59:11.000 --> 1:59:13.708
-Good morning, ma.
-Good morning.

1:59:14.416 --> 1:59:15.750
Tolani!

1:59:17.458 --> 1:59:18.875
-Tolani.
-Ma?

1:59:18.958 --> 1:59:20.291
You have a visitor.

1:59:21.083 --> 1:59:22.416
Who is it?

1:59:29.791 --> 1:59:31.166
Sanwo.

1:59:32.250 --> 1:59:33.583
How'd you know I was here?

1:59:34.166 --> 1:59:35.375
I'm going to the market.

1:59:36.875 --> 1:59:38.666
When I get back,
we'll finish our talk.

1:59:38.750 --> 1:59:39.625
Yes, ma.

1:59:40.625 --> 1:59:41.958
-Bye, ma.
-Bye, ma.

1:59:42.041 --> 1:59:43.000
Bye, my dear.

1:59:48.250 --> 1:59:49.375
Have a seat.

1:59:52.041 --> 1:59:53.875
You're surprised to see me, right?

1:59:55.125 --> 1:59:56.625
Will you drink some water?

1:59:57.250 --> 1:59:58.500
I will.

2:00:18.541 --> 2:00:20.291
-Here.
-Thank you.

2:00:34.375 --> 2:00:35.458
Help me give thanks.

2:00:36.458 --> 2:00:37.333
For what?

2:00:38.125 --> 2:00:39.333
I found a job.

2:00:40.750 --> 2:00:41.875
Where?

2:00:42.625 --> 2:00:44.041
Consultancy firm.

2:00:45.083 --> 2:00:46.625
What would you be doing there?

2:00:47.416 --> 2:00:49.750
I'm in the accounting department.

2:00:50.833 --> 2:00:52.583
At least you'll be able to move out.

2:00:59.000 --> 2:01:00.250
Tolani, what happened?

2:01:00.333 --> 2:01:01.541
I called your office,

2:01:02.916 --> 2:01:06.000
Godwin said Salako sacked you
for misconduct.

2:01:06.083 --> 2:01:07.916
When I pressed him further,

2:01:08.000 --> 2:01:11.833
he said Mrs. Archibong
queried Salako and suspended him.

2:01:11.916 --> 2:01:14.500
That suspension is how he'll lose his job.

2:01:14.583 --> 2:01:17.625
May God let her read
what I wrote in my report.

2:01:17.708 --> 2:01:20.541
She'll see that Rose and I were not crazy.

2:01:22.208 --> 2:01:25.750
He doesn't know who he's dealing with.
He doesn't know your spirit.

2:01:28.291 --> 2:01:29.833
What are you going to do now?

2:01:31.375 --> 2:01:34.458
I don't know yet. I don't know.

2:01:36.250 --> 2:01:37.500
[Tolani sighs]

2:01:48.791 --> 2:01:50.416
This is the money you loaned me.

2:01:51.500 --> 2:01:52.666
Take it.

2:01:56.833 --> 2:01:59.166
And I'll give you more
before the end of the month.

2:01:59.833 --> 2:02:01.583
For the suffering you went through.

2:02:02.375 --> 2:02:03.708
This is enough.

2:02:04.875 --> 2:02:06.458
You tried.

2:02:07.500 --> 2:02:09.166
It's not up to you to decide.

2:02:10.750 --> 2:02:11.833
Thank you.

2:02:14.541 --> 2:02:17.833
[Tolani] You did everything you could
to try and drive me away.

2:02:18.833 --> 2:02:22.250
-It's not like that.
-It's not like that? How is it then?

2:02:22.333 --> 2:02:25.208
Can you not remember
all the rubbish you did?

2:02:25.958 --> 2:02:28.541
-You're the one who did rubbish.
-Me, doing rubbish?

2:02:30.166 --> 2:02:31.333
Stop lying.

2:02:32.833 --> 2:02:34.583
-Tolani.
-Mm?

2:02:34.666 --> 2:02:37.708
You know only rich people
get married before they're 40.

2:02:37.791 --> 2:02:38.708
Mmm!

2:02:38.791 --> 2:02:41.583
I'm not important?
Money is more important than me.

2:02:41.666 --> 2:02:42.583
Don't say that.

2:02:42.666 --> 2:02:47.416
After all the trouble you caused me.
You think I'll let you go that easily?

2:02:48.500 --> 2:02:51.125
[upbeat music playing]

2:02:51.208 --> 2:02:53.041
[chuckles]

2:03:01.083 --> 2:03:04.833
That reminds me.
I forgot to ask you, where's Rose?

2:03:04.916 --> 2:03:06.125
Good afternoon.

2:03:07.541 --> 2:03:08.791
Rose.

2:03:09.875 --> 2:03:12.083
Mama Chidi said she wasn't home.

2:03:12.166 --> 2:03:13.791
Rose has gone home.

2:03:15.750 --> 2:03:18.791
That's good. We all need rest.

2:03:41.291 --> 2:03:42.916
That reminds me, Sanwo, please,

2:03:43.000 --> 2:03:46.583
help me give my landlord this one
and give Violet this one.

2:03:46.666 --> 2:03:48.625
And you know my furniture?

2:03:48.708 --> 2:03:51.458
I want you to send it to me
when you get to Lagos.

2:03:51.541 --> 2:03:54.500
Or maybe you should help me sell them
and send the money.

2:03:54.583 --> 2:03:56.625
Tolani. Say it one at a time.

2:03:56.708 --> 2:04:00.416
All right, don't be upset.
I'll write it all down.

2:04:00.500 --> 2:04:03.416
But can I trust you to follow through?

2:04:05.083 --> 2:04:09.250
-I've told you before, I'm not a bastard.
-Alright, I've hear you. Don't be angry.

2:04:10.833 --> 2:04:14.208
[upbeat music playing]

2:04:25.541 --> 2:04:27.250
-Sorry.
-[driver] No worries, sir.
