00:47.160 --> 00:50.891
I should never have
allied myself with a madman.

00:57.637 --> 00:58.763
Where are they?

00:59.706 --> 01:01.264
In Sarajevo, sir.

01:02.476 --> 01:06.276
And he has the boy.

01:15.389 --> 01:19.052
Wow, that looked like it really hurt:

01:29.836 --> 01:31.565
Whoa, now, hang on.

01:31.738 --> 01:34.138
That looked like it hurt a lot more:

01:34.574 --> 01:38.533
So let's try and clear this up, okay,
pumpkin?

01:38.712 --> 01:41.374
What hurts more? A?

01:42.616 --> 01:44.607
Or B?

01:44.785 --> 01:46.047
Forehand?

01:46.953 --> 01:48.386
Or backhand?

01:59.966 --> 02:02.264
A little louder, lamb chop.

02:02.436 --> 02:06.429
I think you may have a collapsed lung.
That always impedes the oratory.

02:10.477 --> 02:12.172
Now, that was rude.

02:12.345 --> 02:14.905
The first boy blunder had some manners.

02:18.218 --> 02:20.652
I suppose I'm going to have
to teach you a lesson...

02:20.821 --> 02:23.790
...so you can better follow
in his footsteps.

02:25.125 --> 02:28.356
No, I'm just gonna keep beating you
with this crowbar.

02:39.005 --> 02:41.269
Where is the detective?

02:41.441 --> 02:43.102
He's on his way.

02:48.849 --> 02:52.842
But, sir, he won't make it there in time.

03:01.561 --> 03:03.825
Okay, kiddo, I gotta go.

03:03.997 --> 03:06.295
It's been fun though, right?

03:07.567 --> 03:10.536
Well, maybe a smidge more fun for me
than you.

03:10.704 --> 03:13.400
I'm just guessing
since you're being awful quiet.

03:13.573 --> 03:19.068
Anyway, be a good boy.
Finish your homework and be in bed by 9.

03:19.246 --> 03:20.645
And, hey...

03:21.248 --> 03:26.686
...please tell the big man I said, "Hello."

05:10.256 --> 05:12.190
No.

05:20.266 --> 05:22.234
Jason.

07:50.383 --> 07:51.441
The hell you say.

07:51.918 --> 07:53.044
You didn't set this up?

07:53.219 --> 07:56.347
- Then whose party is this?
- I thought it was you east-Side losers.

07:56.523 --> 08:00.482
You already rolled over for the Black Mask
and I figured you were gonna ask us in.

08:00.660 --> 08:05.256
Rolled over? The Mask whacked
six of my crew in a month. Six.

08:05.431 --> 08:06.989
Some of my best people.

08:07.167 --> 08:08.657
So you set up this meet?

08:08.835 --> 08:10.826
No, I thought it was Chi Chi:

08:11.004 --> 08:12.130
Wasn't my meet:

08:13.039 --> 08:16.600
Oh, the hell with this. I'm gone.
You brain donors wanna hang around--

08:16.776 --> 08:18.141
Sit down, Freddie.

08:20.180 --> 08:21.545
It's my meeting.

08:21.714 --> 08:23.375
- It's him.
- Batman?

08:23.550 --> 08:24.642
We didn't do nothing.

08:24.818 --> 08:27.719
Well, we all know that's a lie.

08:28.321 --> 08:30.118
- Who the hell are you?
- Smoke him.

08:36.663 --> 08:38.028
I said, "Sit down."

08:38.198 --> 08:41.190
You wanna die?
There's easier ways to kill yourself.

08:41.366 --> 08:44.666
Yeah, like yelling at the guy
who's holding the AK-47.

08:44.838 --> 08:47.033
Listen to me,
you drug-Peddling scumbags.

08:47.207 --> 08:49.698
I will be running the drug trade
from now on.

08:49.876 --> 08:52.936
You eight are the most prosperous
street dealers in Gotham.

08:53.112 --> 08:55.046
I'm offering you morons a deal.

08:55.215 --> 08:59.345
You go about your business as usual,
but kick up 40 percent to me.

08:59.519 --> 09:02.386
A much sweeter deal
than the scraps Black Mask is leaving you.

09:02.555 --> 09:07.390
In return, you will have total protection
from both Black Mask and Batman.

09:07.560 --> 09:09.721
But you stay away from kids
and school yards.

09:10.330 --> 09:12.457
No dealing to children, got it?

09:12.632 --> 09:15.396
If you do, you're dead.

09:15.568 --> 09:18.799
Okay, crazy man,
this is all very generous.

09:18.972 --> 09:20.735
But why in the hell
should we listen to you?

09:31.951 --> 09:33.145
Damn.

09:33.319 --> 09:35.947
Those are the heads
of all of your lieutenants.

09:36.122 --> 09:37.714
That took me two hours.

09:37.891 --> 09:40.689
You wanna see what I can get done
in a whole evening?

09:40.860 --> 09:42.293
Make no mistake.

09:42.462 --> 09:45.090
I'm not asking you to kick in with me.

09:45.265 --> 09:47.130
I'm telling you.

09:55.708 --> 09:57.733
Forty percent works for me.

10:10.516 --> 10:12.609
- Go, go, go!
- Where's Raymond and Denny?

10:12.785 --> 10:14.946
Screw it.

10:15.121 --> 10:16.782
Just go, get us out of here.

10:21.360 --> 10:22.622
I think I lost him.

10:22.795 --> 10:25.059
- You think I lost him?
- I think you lost him.

10:25.231 --> 10:27.222
I think we're good.

10:27.767 --> 10:30.634
No, you're anything but good.

11:03.269 --> 11:04.497
Who are you working for?

11:04.670 --> 11:05.796
Nobody.

11:05.971 --> 11:08.166
Look, we just boosted the truck and--

11:08.340 --> 11:11.571
Lie to me again
and crashing into a wall head-On...

11:11.744 --> 11:14.338
...will be the least painful activity
of your evening:

11:14.513 --> 11:16.003
No, I swear to--

11:32.098 --> 11:34.566
- What is that?
- Your cargo.

11:40.840 --> 11:42.398
It's called Amazo.

11:42.575 --> 11:44.236
What the hell is an Amazo?

11:44.410 --> 11:46.469
A highly advanced, cybernetic android...

11:46.645 --> 11:49.671
...equipped with the ability
to absorb the power of super humans.

11:49.849 --> 11:51.316
What kind of super humans?

11:58.023 --> 11:59.547
Big ones.

12:12.738 --> 12:16.105
Packs quite the punch
for a toaster on steroids, huh?

12:16.842 --> 12:19.436
- Need a hand?
- No.

12:20.679 --> 12:23.876
Okay, well,
how about I just stick around and watch?

12:36.128 --> 12:38.824
Who's that other one?
The pretty boy in the leotard?

12:38.998 --> 12:41.762
That's Nightwing.
He was the Bat's first sidekick.

12:41.934 --> 12:44.164
The first Robin.

13:00.352 --> 13:03.344
- I think you'll have to do better than that.
- I did.

13:11.197 --> 13:14.132
- Will that do any good?
- It'll slow it down.

13:15.134 --> 13:16.965
You think so?

13:21.340 --> 13:23.240
Get to higher ground.

13:27.346 --> 13:29.075
- Did you know he could fly?
- Move!

13:35.721 --> 13:38.212
I wouldn't be offended
by a few suggestions.

13:38.390 --> 13:40.654
He has the same weak points
as a human being.

13:40.826 --> 13:42.885
Got it. This might sting a bit.

14:05.184 --> 14:07.744
Lasers. He's got lasers.

14:15.861 --> 14:18.853
I don't think putty in his eyes
is gonna hurt him.

14:23.535 --> 14:26.368
But plastique will. Nice.

14:41.954 --> 14:44.320
This shipment was meant
for the Black Mask.

14:44.490 --> 14:46.048
I doubt you're behind this.

14:46.225 --> 14:50.161
- Who do you work for?
- I swear. We're not working for anybody.

14:50.329 --> 14:52.297
This was our gig, all our idea.

14:53.299 --> 14:55.460
- Let it go.
- Right.

15:00.239 --> 15:03.299
I'll talk, I'll talk. Just stop. Just stop!

15:05.311 --> 15:08.144
The Red Hood.
We're working for the Red Hood.

15:08.314 --> 15:10.214
We don't have any choice. He's got--

15:17.756 --> 15:19.986
The shots came from the rooftop.
A sniper.

15:21.827 --> 15:23.192
A good one.

15:28.400 --> 15:31.164
- See him?
- Yeah.

15:35.074 --> 15:36.666
Hey, wait.

15:37.843 --> 15:39.504
Right. Leave me with them.

17:36.595 --> 17:38.790
God, please, no. Stay away.

17:38.964 --> 17:40.795
It's a setup. Wait.

17:42.301 --> 17:43.996
I'm not a crook, I swear.

17:47.506 --> 17:50.407
No!

18:03.856 --> 18:06.120
Hard to forget that night, huh?

18:06.758 --> 18:10.250
In a way, Batman,
this was the site of your first great failure.

18:10.429 --> 18:14.490
Maybe your greatest,
but certainly not your last, right?

18:16.135 --> 18:18.296
Ah, memories.

18:58.477 --> 19:00.570
This bit of Intel
is what brought me to town.

19:00.746 --> 19:04.512
Good thing I've always had perfect timing.
Take a look.

19:08.687 --> 19:12.680
I got this shot from a snitch. He says that
this guy's been making some serious moves.

19:12.858 --> 19:13.984
The Red Hood.

19:14.159 --> 19:16.593
Might be.
He bears a resemblance to the original.

19:18.363 --> 19:20.797
Several criminals have utilized this persona.

19:20.966 --> 19:23.628
One criminal of particular interest, though.

19:23.802 --> 19:26.566
- But he's locked up.
- Not his m.O. Either.

19:26.738 --> 19:30.936
There's been an up tick in heavy trafficking,
but crime is down.

19:31.109 --> 19:32.167
Indeed it is.

19:32.344 --> 19:35.507
Master Bruce got almost three hours sleep
in the last two days.

19:35.681 --> 19:37.478
True busman's holiday.

19:37.649 --> 19:39.480
But he is locked up.

19:39.651 --> 19:42.085
Like, a lot locked up.

19:42.254 --> 19:44.552
Maybe we should go for a visit.

19:47.159 --> 19:51.095
Could you just once say,
"Let's get in the car"? Is that so hard?

20:31.703 --> 20:34.797
You look good. Been working out?

20:35.274 --> 20:37.640
You could probably use a little sun.

20:38.477 --> 20:41.605
Then again, who am Ito talk?

20:49.921 --> 20:52.412
He's calling himself the Red Hood:

20:53.191 --> 20:54.590
What do you know about it?

20:55.294 --> 20:57.785
That he has horrible taste.

20:57.963 --> 20:59.931
When I wore that number, it was classy.

21:00.098 --> 21:03.124
More flashy maitre d'
than motorcycle fetish.

21:03.302 --> 21:05.099
Oh, these kids today.

21:05.270 --> 21:08.603
If you're behind this in any way,
we will find out.

21:08.774 --> 21:12.574
- You're not--
- Oh, Bird Boy, you're so much less fun now.

21:12.744 --> 21:16.874
All grown up and in your big-Boy pants.

21:17.049 --> 21:20.951
Still, better off than his replacement,
right?

21:21.520 --> 21:26.048
Even tougher making with the yuks
when you're worm food, huh?

21:37.569 --> 21:39.628
You gonna do it this time?

21:39.805 --> 21:43.571
Or you just gonna put me
in another body cast for six months?

21:54.152 --> 21:56.643
So disappointing.

21:56.888 --> 21:59.516
But back to the matter at hand...

21:59.691 --> 22:01.784
...this new hoody.

22:01.960 --> 22:05.293
You really think I would stir up
so much trouble...

22:05.464 --> 22:08.922
...and not make sure
you knew it was me?

22:28.220 --> 22:30.882
I know you've never met him before,
but be cool.

22:31.056 --> 22:32.580
This here is the Black Mask.

22:32.758 --> 22:36.717
The first boss to gain control
of the entire city in 20 years.

22:36.895 --> 22:39.295
Whatever he wants in Gotham, he gets.

22:40.432 --> 22:45.335
But his appearance
takes a bit to warm up to.

22:45.504 --> 22:48.064
He did what? What?

22:48.240 --> 22:51.232
Oh, good, he's pissed.

22:52.477 --> 22:55.310
Our concern is the one
who ordered the theft of the android.

22:55.480 --> 22:57.641
He goes by the name of Red Hood.

22:58.216 --> 23:00.047
I don't care what he's calling himself.

23:00.218 --> 23:02.743
Do you idiots know
how many bidders I had on Amazo?

23:02.921 --> 23:06.823
A list of puppet dictators
and psychos as long as my arm.

23:06.992 --> 23:09.153
Millions shot right to hell.

23:09.327 --> 23:12.262
- And whose money is that?
- Your money.

23:12.864 --> 23:15.992
My money. Mine.

23:16.401 --> 23:18.335
This score was a game changer.

23:18.503 --> 23:22.599
Amazo was going buy my way up
into high-End international trafficking.

23:23.275 --> 23:27.871
Now I'm forced to keep rooting around
in this local leg-Breaking garbage.

23:28.046 --> 23:32.676
And he gives me bat trouble,
who blows the damn robot's head off!

23:32.851 --> 23:37.151
I could have at least sold it for scrap,
but Batman kept it.

23:37.322 --> 23:40.257
Yes, Batman likes to keep things.

23:41.092 --> 23:46.223
- Look, this circus act, this Red Foot--
- Red Hood.

23:46.398 --> 23:48.093
Whatever.

23:48.400 --> 23:51.995
He's dead. Take care of him.

23:54.272 --> 23:56.206
You, new guy.

23:56.842 --> 23:59.208
BLACK MASK: Don't be nervous, kid.

23:59.711 --> 24:04.478
But if you keep staring at me like that,
I'm gonna cut your eyes out.

24:11.490 --> 24:15.688
Yes, sir.

24:15.861 --> 24:18.728
It's 10 cases of assorted SMGs
and PDWs...

24:18.897 --> 24:22.594
...along with 5000 .45 caliber ACP rounds,
your personal favorite...

24:22.767 --> 24:24.166
...and two cases of RPGs.

24:24.970 --> 24:28.337
It's all bought and paid for,
so this is strictly a delivery, not a buy.

24:28.507 --> 24:31.670
In view of recent events, I've taken
the liberty of doubling security...

24:31.843 --> 24:33.435
...and switching the drop spot.

24:33.612 --> 24:35.170
That sounds like a plan.

24:51.897 --> 24:55.731
- What are they waiting around for?
- Seriously.

24:57.202 --> 25:00.899
Hey, protocol says I'm only supposed to be
on the ground for six minutes.

25:02.407 --> 25:04.398
It's okay. I won't be staying that long.

25:25.096 --> 25:26.927
And I almost thought he wouldn't show.

25:28.833 --> 25:31.859
You know what I missed most
about running with you? The toys.

25:32.037 --> 25:33.629
Stay sharp. We're not done.

25:33.805 --> 25:35.898
You wanna dance? Let's dance.

25:37.909 --> 25:39.501
- Is that gonna hold?
- No.

25:39.678 --> 25:41.703
So you want me to--? Should i--?

25:41.880 --> 25:44.474
Okay, I'll just take care of this.

26:18.984 --> 26:21.350
Okay then. Nice night for a run.

27:42.600 --> 27:45.228
- He's good.
- Yes, he's putting on quite a show.

28:02.587 --> 28:04.179
He's very good.

28:07.625 --> 28:09.252
We got him.

28:17.235 --> 28:19.965
- That's impressive.
- Nothing we haven't seen before.

28:20.138 --> 28:21.435
If you say so.

28:26.778 --> 28:28.643
Think we lost him?

28:31.049 --> 28:32.380
Move!

28:48.633 --> 28:50.863
You haven't lost your touch--

29:08.486 --> 29:11.944
He's got some moves, huh?
And as much I hate to belabor a point...

29:12.123 --> 29:14.557
And still that is often
exactly what you do.

29:14.726 --> 29:16.626
I'm chatty. It's part of my charm.

29:16.795 --> 29:19.025
I'm saying that our boy here
has some skills.

29:19.564 --> 29:22.965
He's been trained and trained well.
Like right there. That.

29:23.134 --> 29:26.592
He sliced that cable
off his ankle before it went taut.

29:26.771 --> 29:29.706
You don't just do that.
That has to be practiced. Learned.

29:29.874 --> 29:32.035
- And then there's the knife.
- What about it?

29:32.544 --> 29:34.535
You know many knives
that can cut my lines?

29:35.079 --> 29:38.845
- Not many.
- No. Not many.

29:39.017 --> 29:42.953
Well, look, we obviously have got
ourselves a player, we-- Ow!

29:43.121 --> 29:44.986
Alfred, take him home.

29:45.156 --> 29:46.646
Bruce, I can still help.

29:47.659 --> 29:49.183
You already have.

29:49.360 --> 29:50.827
Thank you.

29:50.995 --> 29:52.826
Go rest up.

29:53.431 --> 29:54.557
Okay.

29:54.732 --> 29:57.565
But you know where to find me
if you need me.

29:58.803 --> 30:00.862
He did just thank me, right?

30:01.039 --> 30:03.564
- Indeed he did, sir.
- Weird.

30:10.148 --> 30:11.911
You haven't lost your touch--

30:18.623 --> 30:20.181
You haven't lost your touch--

30:21.693 --> 30:23.024
--Your touch, Bru--

30:28.900 --> 30:31.027
You haven't lost your touch, Bruce.

31:10.875 --> 31:13.275
Whoo-Hoo!

31:13.444 --> 31:15.275
You guys having a party?

31:17.749 --> 31:21.480
- I guess our invite got lost.
- It's over, Riddler.

31:34.265 --> 31:38.429
Riddle me this. What's green and purple
but covered in red and yellow?

31:44.509 --> 31:48.070
You. When I land on your sorry butt.

31:48.246 --> 31:49.645
Don't move or I'll--

31:49.814 --> 31:51.975
You'll what? Shoot me?

32:06.798 --> 32:09.699
Twenty rounds a second
and you were still too slow.

32:11.035 --> 32:12.593
I'm not slow, punk.

32:13.571 --> 32:15.129
- Me neither.
- I've got him.

32:19.944 --> 32:21.775
Robin!

32:24.282 --> 32:26.045
I had to take him down.

32:26.217 --> 32:27.878
You shattered his collar bone.

32:28.052 --> 32:29.246
He's a drug-Dealing pimp.

32:29.420 --> 32:32.548
I didn't think I had to prop up some pillows
before I took him out.

32:32.724 --> 32:35.056
We needed him. He would've talked.

32:35.226 --> 32:36.818
But you put him into shock.

32:38.329 --> 32:39.660
Sorry.

32:39.831 --> 32:41.196
That was dumb.

32:41.366 --> 32:43.300
But he deserved it.

33:00.051 --> 33:03.418
Maybe my last request
was too mired in subtlety.

33:04.455 --> 33:06.082
I want this man dead.

33:07.158 --> 33:10.855
When I say "dead," I mean seriously dead.

33:11.396 --> 33:13.694
Beaten, broken.

33:13.865 --> 33:18.029
His-Head-Mounted-On-My-Wall
kind of dead!

33:18.202 --> 33:19.533
Understood.

33:19.704 --> 33:22.366
We'll be taking further precautions
at every transaction--

33:22.540 --> 33:26.670
Screw that.
Time he learns that this is a contact sport.

33:26.844 --> 33:28.607
We're going on offense.

33:28.780 --> 33:32.682
Rough up his business.
Something big. Something loud.

33:32.850 --> 33:36.946
When he shows up to shut us down,
have a party waiting for him.

33:37.121 --> 33:38.611
And when I say "party"...

33:38.790 --> 33:43.693
...I actually mean a whole lot of people
who are gonna kill him!

33:43.861 --> 33:47.319
- I figured.
- Just being clear.

34:16.393 --> 34:18.658
What are you doing? We're protected.

34:18.830 --> 34:20.491
We pay up to the Red Hood.

34:20.665 --> 34:22.326
Is that right?

34:26.404 --> 34:27.735
Cute.

34:48.626 --> 34:51.527
Do you know who you're messing with?

34:51.696 --> 34:53.721
Yeah, Tyler Bramford.

34:53.898 --> 34:57.800
You're a club owner and some big damned
drug dealer in the East Quarter, right?

34:57.969 --> 35:03.202
I am the East Quarter drug trade,
you stupid bags of--

35:03.374 --> 35:04.773
Manners, fatty.

35:04.942 --> 35:07.877
I don't care who takes care of you.
You watch your mouth.

35:08.045 --> 35:10.775
Then you know who's got my back.

35:10.948 --> 35:12.381
You know who I answer to.

35:12.550 --> 35:14.450
The Red Hood.

35:14.619 --> 35:18.487
And we work for the man
who's gonna take back what's his.

35:19.090 --> 35:23.322
So at the expense
of your very wide butt...

35:24.996 --> 35:27.157
...we're sending your boss a message.

35:34.205 --> 35:35.866
Okay.

35:36.874 --> 35:38.808
What's the message?

35:42.480 --> 35:43.913
A simple one, actually.

35:46.050 --> 35:48.416
Want to guess what it might be?

35:49.220 --> 35:50.710
I have a few ideas.

36:19.884 --> 36:22.284
Any of you hired guns even know
who I am?

36:22.453 --> 36:24.614
You are our target.

36:35.733 --> 36:36.995
Ow.

36:37.168 --> 36:41.798
So you four have all this power
and all you do with it is kill for money?

36:41.973 --> 36:44.737
From what I hear,
we've got that in common.

36:45.776 --> 36:46.902
You heard wrong.

36:59.724 --> 37:02.215
I thought you'd put up more of a fight.

37:02.793 --> 37:04.954
Oh, the fight hasn't started yet.

37:05.129 --> 37:06.460
I'm just stalling.

37:20.745 --> 37:23.976
- What the hell took you so long?
- Shut up and fight.

38:25.976 --> 38:27.466
I gotta say.

38:27.645 --> 38:28.907
I missed watching you work.

38:30.848 --> 38:32.213
Look out!

38:56.173 --> 38:58.004
Awful close.

38:58.175 --> 38:59.540
You afraid you'll miss?

38:59.710 --> 39:01.871
Black Mask just wants a body.

39:02.046 --> 39:04.947
Let him go.

39:05.116 --> 39:07.107
And step away.

39:07.284 --> 39:09.184
A Taser?

39:10.254 --> 39:12.347
Nail me and you'll electrocute both of us.

39:13.524 --> 39:15.287
Maybe that's what he has in mind.

39:20.631 --> 39:22.064
No!

39:24.735 --> 39:26.862
Just be happy I only killed one of them.

39:27.037 --> 39:28.527
They're all assassins.

39:28.706 --> 39:29.866
And what are you?

39:30.040 --> 39:31.701
I'm cleaning up Gotham.

39:31.876 --> 39:33.275
More than you ever did.

39:33.444 --> 39:38.006
You're stealing territory from Black Mask
and killing anyone who gets in your way.

39:38.182 --> 39:40.742
Black Mask is just a part of the plan.

39:40.918 --> 39:43.614
Plan? You're becoming a crime lord.

39:43.788 --> 39:47.622
Yes. You can't stop crime.
That's what you never understood.

39:47.792 --> 39:49.225
I'm controlling it.

39:50.394 --> 39:54.125
You wanna rule them by fear. But what do
you do with the ones who aren't afraid?

39:54.298 --> 39:56.960
I'm doing what you won't,
I'm taking them out.

39:58.469 --> 40:01.063
Tell me what happened to you.
Let me help.

40:03.140 --> 40:04.801
It's too late.

40:05.443 --> 40:06.569
You had your chance.

40:13.150 --> 40:16.017
And I'm just getting started.

41:13.577 --> 41:19.516
Son of a-- Are you telling me
that scumbag stole my guns again?

41:20.050 --> 41:24.487
No, sir: He destroyed them.
Blew up the truck, the drivers....

41:24.655 --> 41:28.147
Damn it. Of all the-- Damn it!

41:28.325 --> 41:32.261
Previously, he was just enlisting anyone
under our province to come work for him.

41:32.429 --> 41:36.024
Now he just seems to be killing them.

41:36.200 --> 41:38.668
Oh, so now we've got another Batman?

41:38.836 --> 41:40.531
One who doesn't mind the blood?

41:40.704 --> 41:42.604
No, sir, he's no Batman.

41:42.773 --> 41:45.298
He's still taking huge cuts
from off the streets.

41:45.476 --> 41:48.172
But now
he's eliminating the competition.

41:48.345 --> 41:49.710
He's coming after you.

41:56.720 --> 42:00.019
You wanna tell me
why this guy ain't dead?

42:00.190 --> 42:03.353
We're trying.
We sent the Fearsome Hand of Four.

42:04.895 --> 42:08.695
Four? Guess they're gonna need
a new name.

42:08.866 --> 42:12.563
Why hasn't Batman wiped this little smear
off the face of the planet?

42:12.736 --> 42:14.670
Maybe he doesn't want to.

42:14.838 --> 42:17.807
Perhaps he's letting you
and the Red Hood war it out.

42:17.975 --> 42:21.103
- He could be waiting--
- To take on the winner?

42:21.545 --> 42:25.140
What do you think this is?
A tennis tournament?

42:25.316 --> 42:27.580
You're an idiot.

42:27.751 --> 42:29.309
And you don't know Batman.

42:29.486 --> 42:32.887
He's not letting this lunatic just run wild.

42:33.057 --> 42:35.423
He can't catch him either.

42:35.626 --> 42:38.925
Or it's something else.

42:39.430 --> 42:41.125
Can't you feel it?

42:41.298 --> 42:43.766
We're stuck in the damn crossfire.

42:52.843 --> 42:54.743
Oh, hell.

42:59.149 --> 43:00.673
Sir?

43:01.385 --> 43:04.980
Wow, he sure can move
when he really wants to.

43:20.804 --> 43:24.069
- You okay, sir?
- I'm not dead.

43:24.241 --> 43:26.072
So that's something.

43:26.243 --> 43:27.403
Okay.

43:27.578 --> 43:30.945
- Time to change up the ground war.
- How so, sir?

43:31.115 --> 43:34.448
I'm being forced into negotiating
with a psychotic.

43:34.618 --> 43:36.176
That doesn't sound good.

43:36.720 --> 43:38.085
No.

43:38.255 --> 43:40.849
It's going to be a nightmare.

43:53.671 --> 43:56.003
Hey, fellas,
10 minutes to bed check, right?

43:56.173 --> 43:59.165
- Terry? What the hell are you doing here?
- You miss me?

43:59.343 --> 44:03.006
I'm covering Rothman's shift.
He's got the flu, bronchitis or something.

44:03.180 --> 44:06.672
We got this. Why don't you grab us some joe?
We'll meet you in the south wing.

44:06.850 --> 44:08.010
That's not protocol.

44:08.185 --> 44:11.154
Come on, I'm bored,
- Let's get--

44:14.358 --> 44:16.019
Sorry, schedule to keep.

44:17.294 --> 44:18.886
You didn't have to kill him.

44:19.063 --> 44:22.055
One, yes, I did.
Two, we're paying you a ton.

44:22.232 --> 44:25.224
So, three, shut your gob
and open the damn door.

44:40.350 --> 44:43.717
- Does he know what's going on?
- He knows he's leaving.

44:44.922 --> 44:47.789
It's gonna be a sleepover, right?

44:48.659 --> 44:51.287
I packed my toothbrush.

45:10.481 --> 45:14.247
- Do you need more light, sir?
- I can see fine.

45:34.872 --> 45:37.033
Well, there you have it.

45:37.207 --> 45:38.731
He's still at rest.

45:38.909 --> 45:40.843
No, he isn't.

45:42.846 --> 45:44.973
That's not flesh.

45:53.423 --> 45:57.189
- Master Bruce, you can't blame yourself--
- It was stupid and careless.

45:57.361 --> 45:58.953
Body was made of high-End latex.

45:59.129 --> 46:01.962
If I'd bothered to look inside
when I brought him home....

46:02.132 --> 46:05.431
Sir, please, remember how distraught
you were. Even I found it hard--

46:06.637 --> 46:08.127
Stupid and careless.

46:09.606 --> 46:13.372
- Where are you going?
- To talk to the man who did this.

46:26.456 --> 46:29.550
I hope you understand the trouble
I've gone through...

46:29.726 --> 46:32.559
...to arrange this little get-Together here.

46:32.729 --> 46:36.893
A lot of money. A lot of dead meat.

46:43.373 --> 46:45.841
Look, I've got a problem.

46:46.009 --> 46:49.570
And you are absolutely the man
who possesses the gifts...

46:49.746 --> 46:52.544
...to take care of this problem.

46:52.716 --> 46:55.514
I need you to murder the Red Hood.

46:55.686 --> 46:57.153
You think you can handle that?

47:01.225 --> 47:03.523
May I have some water?

47:28.318 --> 47:32.448
I'm going to need something to wear...

47:32.623 --> 47:34.682
...and a very big truck.

47:35.325 --> 47:37.691
Anything else?

47:38.195 --> 47:40.629
I'll need some guys.

47:41.531 --> 47:45.023
Not these guys
because, well, they're kind of dead.

48:26.443 --> 48:28.775
What did you do to Jason?

48:28.946 --> 48:32.609
Act like you don't know what I'm talking
about and I'll dislocate the shoulder.

48:32.783 --> 48:33.943
That's just to start.

48:34.117 --> 48:38.417
If you haven't disabled the roof sensors,
my guards will be here in under a minute.

48:38.622 --> 48:39.680
Answer me.

48:41.625 --> 48:42.649
I'm willing to...

48:42.826 --> 48:46.489
...but it'll be more expedient if you hand me
the communicator in my pocket...

48:46.663 --> 48:49.632
...and I call off my men.

48:53.704 --> 48:56.002
Commander, this is Ra's Al Ghul.

48:56.173 --> 48:58.038
Stand down.

48:58.208 --> 49:02.201
I will be entertaining a guest
in my study.

49:05.949 --> 49:08.281
You remember
when we last became embattled?

49:08.452 --> 49:10.511
You were planning to blow up banks.

49:10.687 --> 49:13.247
Accurate, if inelegant.

49:13.423 --> 49:17.223
I was in the midst of toppling the economy
of Europe...

49:17.394 --> 49:20.295
...but you were on to me.

49:20.831 --> 49:22.526
I sought a distraction.

49:23.100 --> 49:25.466
So I hired the Joker.

49:30.774 --> 49:32.742
When your paths crossed in Bosnia...

49:33.677 --> 49:36.237
...it was to appear
that you had stumbled upon him.

49:48.392 --> 49:52.192
He was paid extremely well for what
was intended to be a wild-Goose chase.

49:58.035 --> 50:02.233
Then he murdered the boy.

50:02.973 --> 50:05.339
That was not by design.

50:05.509 --> 50:09.343
I'm afraid I overestimated my ability
to control the Joker...

50:09.513 --> 50:12.971
...just as I underestimated his madness.

50:13.150 --> 50:14.515
It grieved me, sir...

50:14.684 --> 50:17.084
...to be a party to something so brutal.

50:17.254 --> 50:19.586
You've never shied away
from drawing blood.

50:19.756 --> 50:22.418
True, but always with purpose.

50:22.592 --> 50:24.492
Always with greater goals.

50:24.661 --> 50:27.289
This was simply an unnecessary casualty.

50:27.464 --> 50:31.798
As penance,
I chose not to make war with you again...

50:31.968 --> 50:34.732
...and to attempt
to rectify this disservice.

50:34.905 --> 50:36.065
Rectify?

50:36.540 --> 50:37.734
Yes.

50:37.908 --> 50:41.366
I had hoped to return to you
what you had lost.

50:43.547 --> 50:47.039
I have walked this world
for nearly six centuries.

50:47.217 --> 50:48.411
As you know...

50:48.585 --> 50:53.522
...I achieve this by bathing in
the rejuvenating waters of the Lazarus Pit.

51:07.370 --> 51:09.065
Along with its healing abilities...

51:09.239 --> 51:13.232
...it has long been rumored
that it is capable of an even greater feat...

51:13.810 --> 51:16.074
...to raise the dead.

51:18.882 --> 51:22.249
Procuring the remains of your partner
was not difficult.

51:22.419 --> 51:26.219
You had come to Bosnia
under the guise of Bruce Wayne...

51:26.823 --> 51:29.690
...and you chose to depart as such.

51:30.827 --> 51:32.624
You even concocted the cover story...

51:32.796 --> 51:36.698
...that young Jason had died in a bombing
in Sarajevo.

51:37.334 --> 51:39.461
This made it easy for me.

51:40.770 --> 51:44.171
All it took was a few payoffs
to replace his body.

51:48.345 --> 51:51.143
I felt confident
that you would not perform an autopsy...

51:51.882 --> 51:54.783
...even if you had,
we still would have bought enough time.

51:54.951 --> 51:56.316
But my plan...

51:57.787 --> 52:03.384
...well, detective,
it had unfortunate results.

52:46.236 --> 52:47.931
He returned to this world...

52:48.104 --> 52:51.631
...but returned damaged.

53:23.240 --> 53:25.140
My army searched for months...

53:25.308 --> 53:28.709
...but we were never able to find a body
or pick up a trail.

53:29.379 --> 53:31.279
I thought him dead yet again.

53:31.881 --> 53:36.375
But I hear you have been having trouble
at home.

53:36.553 --> 53:40.683
I have returned your son to you
as a blight upon your house.

53:40.890 --> 53:42.619
He burns the very kingdom you--

53:44.127 --> 53:45.617
--Protect.

53:51.268 --> 53:53.133
Shall I alert the guards to pursue him?

53:53.303 --> 53:56.500
Don't be foolish.
They would never catch him.

53:56.673 --> 53:59.699
Besides, I have done enough.

54:08.518 --> 54:11.851
Sir, please take this to heart.

54:12.022 --> 54:14.422
Who Jason was before,
how we lost him...

54:14.591 --> 54:18.186
...and this dark miracle or curse
that has brought about his return...

54:18.361 --> 54:20.090
...it is not your fault.

54:20.263 --> 54:22.925
I know you view his death
as your greatest failure but--

54:23.099 --> 54:25.533
His life and his death
are my greatest failure.

54:25.702 --> 54:27.863
Do you remember how he was
when I found him?

54:28.038 --> 54:33.135
Of course, sir.
Fearless, arrogant, brash and gifted.

54:33.310 --> 54:36.677
Yes.
Different than Dick in so many ways...

54:36.846 --> 54:40.612
...but still so full of potential and power.

54:40.784 --> 54:44.015
But I knew, even from the beginning,
he was dangerous.

54:44.187 --> 54:48.385
If I hadn't made him into Robin,
he would have grown to do wrong.

54:49.059 --> 54:50.549
Then I got him killed.

54:50.727 --> 54:51.989
My partner.

54:52.162 --> 54:53.493
My soldier.

54:53.663 --> 54:54.857
My fault.

54:55.031 --> 54:56.396
I own that.

54:56.566 --> 54:59.364
I'll carry that like everything else:

54:59.536 --> 55:00.969
But now there's this.

55:01.137 --> 55:04.197
He's taken everything I've ever taught him
and turned it on me.

55:04.374 --> 55:06.501
It's a hell of my own making, Alfred.

55:06.676 --> 55:09.770
Sir, this is not your doing.
- He knows that.

55:09.946 --> 55:12.312
- It should be enough.
- It's not.

55:15.118 --> 55:17.279
Reporting live from Gotham Bay Bridge....

55:17.454 --> 55:20.355
My word.
Sir, patch into the media feed now.

55:31.501 --> 55:33.833
Come on, get out of there, now.

55:34.637 --> 55:39.165
Don't know what that maniac's up to, but
nobody make a move till I give the order.

55:56.793 --> 55:58.761
I'm a little teapot

55:58.928 --> 56:00.725
Short and stout

56:01.498 --> 56:06.094
Here is my handle
Here is my spout

56:08.838 --> 56:12.535
This wasn't part of the damn deal,
you freak!

56:12.709 --> 56:15.542
Get me out of here right now!

56:15.712 --> 56:19.045
I thought you'd enjoy
seeing some old faces.

56:19.215 --> 56:23.311
After all, most of these guys
used to work for you.

56:24.087 --> 56:26.578
Who's that? Get a light on him.

56:30.093 --> 56:31.856
Up there.

56:37.133 --> 56:42.002
Hey, look at you. Mr. Hood.

56:42.172 --> 56:44.299
Or do you prefer Red?

56:44.474 --> 56:46.738
I used to wear an outfit a lot like that.

56:46.910 --> 56:50.402
Mine was more flashy maitre d'
than motorcycle fetish.

56:50.580 --> 56:53.515
You kids today.

56:54.150 --> 56:56.141
I'm sorry, could you hold on?

56:56.319 --> 57:00.085
I was just in the middle of setting fire
to your gang.

57:00.256 --> 57:03.453
Go ahead.
You think I care if that scum dies?

57:03.626 --> 57:06.686
Don't know. I just wanted your attention.

57:06.863 --> 57:09.093
You've always had my attention.

57:09.265 --> 57:12.701
But what I really wanted
was an audience with you.

57:13.870 --> 57:19.866
I'm sorry, that seems to imply
that you organized this little clambake.

57:20.043 --> 57:22.477
I did. Sure, I had lots of plans...

57:22.645 --> 57:26.843
...but the endgame was getting Black Mask
so desperate that he'd cut a deal.

57:27.016 --> 57:30.452
He was the only one with the connections
to get into Arkham...

57:30.620 --> 57:32.781
...and get you out.

57:32.956 --> 57:35.891
You can't trust anybody.

57:36.059 --> 57:39.460
So I've been bamboozled.

57:39.629 --> 57:41.324
Oh, my.

57:41.498 --> 57:43.090
I wouldn't undersell it.

57:43.266 --> 57:45.530
It took a lot of work
to bring about our reunion.

57:45.702 --> 57:49.331
Reunion? Have we met before?

57:50.073 --> 57:52.337
Yes, we have.

57:52.509 --> 57:55.740
Well, here's to warm memories.

59:00.877 --> 59:02.276
I've got him.

59:02.445 --> 59:06.040
You want him? Meet me at crime alley.

59:15.558 --> 59:17.150
Okay.

59:17.327 --> 59:19.591
So, what's the plan?

59:19.762 --> 59:22.094
Slumber party? Charades?

59:22.265 --> 59:23.789
A little Truth or Dare?

59:23.967 --> 59:26.492
I'll start with "dare."

59:30.740 --> 59:32.674
Well, maybe I'll just go with "truth."

59:42.118 --> 59:44.951
Tell me, how does that feel?

59:46.055 --> 59:50.924
You know, it only hurts when I laugh.

59:54.297 --> 59:57.198
But, hey, I gotta know.

59:57.367 --> 59:58.595
Who are you?

59:58.768 --> 01:00:03.034
You said we knew one another,
and you do seem really familiar.

01:00:03.206 --> 01:00:06.471
We double at the prom?
Or maybe blow up a school bus together?

01:00:07.076 --> 01:00:09.874
No: I'm just something you helped make.

01:00:10.046 --> 01:00:12.708
That's pretty cryptic...

01:00:12.882 --> 01:00:14.179
...but interesting.

01:00:14.350 --> 01:00:15.612
Tell me more.

01:00:16.185 --> 01:00:19.677
Sure. Listen up.

01:00:41.344 --> 01:00:43.744
Unreal.

01:00:55.024 --> 01:00:56.685
Hello.

01:00:58.661 --> 01:01:00.561
So glad you could make it.

01:01:01.097 --> 01:01:03.827
This ends tonight. All of it.

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:06.960
Nobody knows that better than me.

01:01:18.781 --> 01:01:22.148
Ha. Oh, you and your gadgets.

01:01:23.252 --> 01:01:25.186
You're not the only one with toys.

01:01:26.923 --> 01:01:28.356
Crap.

01:02:21.244 --> 01:02:22.734
Look at you.

01:02:26.449 --> 01:02:27.939
I guess we should keep it even.

01:02:33.556 --> 01:02:35.148
Jason.

01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:39.287
Yes.

01:02:39.495 --> 01:02:41.019
I don't wanna fight you.

01:02:41.197 --> 01:02:42.960
All evidence to the contrary.

01:02:43.132 --> 01:02:46.260
Please, I can help you.
I know what happened.

01:02:46.469 --> 01:02:48.596
Oh, you got to talking with Ra's, huh?

01:02:48.771 --> 01:02:52.639
Does it make it easier for you to think
that my dip in his fountain of youth...

01:02:52.809 --> 01:02:54.606
...turned me rabid?

01:02:54.777 --> 01:02:56.642
Or is this just the real me?

01:03:14.664 --> 01:03:15.722
Tell me...

01:03:15.898 --> 01:03:19.664
...what bothers you more, that your greatest
failure has returned from the grave?

01:03:19.836 --> 01:03:22.202
Or that I've become a better Batman
than you?

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:27.105
You're ruling through intimidation
and murder. Just another criminal.

01:03:27.276 --> 01:03:28.834
I'm what this city needs.

01:03:51.834 --> 01:03:55.861
Hidden goodies all over, huh? We're both
just a couple of walking armories.

01:03:56.038 --> 01:04:00.031
Maybe so,
but let's see how you do without your toys.

01:04:28.337 --> 01:04:29.736
Enough. It's over.

01:04:50.726 --> 01:04:53.752
You say you wanna be better than me.
But it won't happen.

01:04:53.930 --> 01:04:54.988
Not like this.

01:05:01.804 --> 01:05:03.635
I know I failed you...

01:05:03.806 --> 01:05:06.206
...but I tried to save you, Jason.

01:05:06.375 --> 01:05:09.674
I'm trying to save you now.

01:05:12.214 --> 01:05:14.341
Is that what you think this is about?

01:05:14.517 --> 01:05:18.510
That you let me die? I don't know
what clouds your judgment worse.

01:05:18.688 --> 01:05:21.851
Your guilt
or your antiquated sense of morality.

01:05:23.326 --> 01:05:26.853
Bruce, I forgive you for not saving me.

01:05:27.029 --> 01:05:30.465
But why? Why on God's earth...

01:05:31.267 --> 01:05:33.565
...is he still alive?

01:05:38.808 --> 01:05:41.299
Gotta give the boy points.

01:05:41.477 --> 01:05:45.470
He came all the way back from the dead
to make this shindig happen.

01:05:45.648 --> 01:05:48.116
So who's got a camera?

01:05:48.284 --> 01:05:51.378
Ooh! Ooh!
Get one of me and the kid first.

01:05:51.554 --> 01:05:54.022
Then you and me, then the three of us.

01:05:54.190 --> 01:05:56.317
And then one with the crowbar. Then--

01:05:59.328 --> 01:06:02.695
You'll be as quiet as possible
or I'll put one in your lap first.

01:06:02.865 --> 01:06:06.130
Party pooper. No cake for you.

01:06:06.869 --> 01:06:09.099
Ignoring what he's done in the past.

01:06:09.271 --> 01:06:13.799
Blind;y, stupid;y, disregarding
the entire graveyards he's filled...

01:06:13.976 --> 01:06:17.343
...the thousands who have suffered,
the friends he's crippled.

01:06:18.114 --> 01:06:19.547
You know, I thought--

01:06:19.715 --> 01:06:23.242
I thought I'd be the last person
you'd ever let him hurt.

01:06:23.652 --> 01:06:26.018
If it had been you
that he beat to a bloody pulp...

01:06:26.188 --> 01:06:29.419
...if he had taken you from this world,
I would've done nothing...

01:06:29.592 --> 01:06:34.894
...but search the planet for this pathetic pile
of evil death-Worshiping garbage...

01:06:35.064 --> 01:06:36.759
...and sent him off to hell.

01:06:36.932 --> 01:06:40.732
You don't understand.
I don't think you've ever understood.

01:06:40.903 --> 01:06:42.461
What?

01:06:42.705 --> 01:06:45.503
What, your moral code
just won't allow for that?

01:06:45.674 --> 01:06:48.074
It's too hard to cross that line?

01:06:48.244 --> 01:06:51.236
No. God Almighty, no.

01:06:51.414 --> 01:06:53.382
It'd be too damned easy.

01:06:53.549 --> 01:06:55.744
All I've ever wanted to do is kill him.

01:06:55.918 --> 01:06:58.614
A day doesn't go by
I don't think about subjecting him...

01:06:58.788 --> 01:07:03.919
...to every horrendous torture
he's dealt out to others and then end him.

01:07:04.093 --> 01:07:07.460
Aw. So you do think about me.

01:07:08.097 --> 01:07:09.860
But if I do that...

01:07:10.032 --> 01:07:13.058
...if I allow myself to go down
into that place...

01:07:14.437 --> 01:07:15.904
...I'll never come back.

01:07:17.373 --> 01:07:22.470
Why? I'm not talking about killing Penguin
or Scarecrow or Dent.

01:07:22.645 --> 01:07:25.409
I'm talking about him. Just him.

01:07:26.048 --> 01:07:28.039
And doing it because....

01:07:28.784 --> 01:07:30.809
Because he took me away from you.

01:07:32.488 --> 01:07:35.218
I can't. I'm sorry.

01:07:36.892 --> 01:07:39.986
That is so sweet.

01:07:40.596 --> 01:07:41.995
Well, you won't have a choice.

01:07:55.444 --> 01:07:57.674
- I won't--
- This is what it's all been about.

01:07:57.847 --> 01:07:59.314
This.

01:07:59.482 --> 01:08:01.382
You, and me and him.

01:08:01.550 --> 01:08:03.245
Now is the time you decide.

01:08:05.154 --> 01:08:09.181
If you won't kill
this psychotic piece of filth, I will.

01:08:09.358 --> 01:08:12.122
If you wanna stop me,
you're gonna have to kill me.

01:08:12.294 --> 01:08:16.024
- You know I won't--
- I'm gonna blow his deranged brains out.

01:08:16.198 --> 01:08:19.361
And if you wanna stop it,
you are gonna have to shoot me.

01:08:19.535 --> 01:08:21.127
Right in my face.

01:08:21.303 --> 01:08:23.533
This is turning out even better
than I'd hoped.

01:08:34.383 --> 01:08:36.977
It's him or me, you have to decide.

01:08:38.821 --> 01:08:40.720
Decide now. Do it.

01:08:40.890 --> 01:08:44.223
Him or me? Decide.

01:09:04.947 --> 01:09:06.505
I can't believe you got him.

01:09:06.682 --> 01:09:10.448
You expert, rooting-Tooting, eagle-Eyed,
goth-Loving marksman.

01:09:10.618 --> 01:09:11.676
I love it.

01:09:11.854 --> 01:09:14.254
You managed to find a way to win.

01:09:14.423 --> 01:09:17.551
And everybody still loses.

01:09:26.001 --> 01:09:28.026
No, don't spoil it. This is better.

01:09:30.339 --> 01:09:33.502
I'm the only one who's gonna get
what he wants tonight.

01:09:33.676 --> 01:09:36.406
Yes, bing, bang, boom.

01:09:36.578 --> 01:09:37.910
We all go out together.

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:41.015
Don't you just love a happy ending?

01:10:29.365 --> 01:10:32.493
Sources close to the
district attorney's office have intimated...

01:10:32.668 --> 01:10:35.398
...the case will likely be dropped
due to lack of evidence.

01:10:35.571 --> 01:10:39.166
But the Black Mask is still under
investigation for his alleged complicity...

01:10:39.341 --> 01:10:41.969
...in Joker's escape from Arkham.

01:10:42.177 --> 01:10:44.873
The guards charged with aiding and abetting
the escape...

01:10:45.047 --> 01:10:47.914
...were found murdered
in the Gotham courthouse jail...

01:10:48.517 --> 01:10:51.315
...while the alleged crime lord, Black Mask,
was released...

01:10:51.487 --> 01:10:54.081
...on $1 million bail
for his suspected involvement...

01:10:54.256 --> 01:10:56.486
...and is currently awaiting a hearing.

01:10:56.659 --> 01:10:59.719
Meanwhile, the Joker has been returned
to Arkham Asylum.

01:10:59.895 --> 01:11:02.193
Officials claim extra measures
have been taken...

01:11:02.364 --> 01:11:04.764
...to ensure another escape
would be impossible.

01:11:05.501 --> 01:11:08.265
Prior to his arrest,
Black Mask was being strong-Armed...

01:11:08.437 --> 01:11:11.372
...by the mysterious Red Hood.

01:11:19.715 --> 01:11:20.773
Sir:

01:11:20.949 --> 01:11:24.510
In light of all the recent events,
would you like me to remove that?

01:11:26.555 --> 01:11:27.988
No.

01:11:30.125 --> 01:11:31.649
This doesn't change anything.

01:11:32.528 --> 01:11:34.996
It doesn't change anything at all.

01:11:46.742 --> 01:11:48.505
Okay, let's go.

01:11:48.677 --> 01:11:50.702
If you can't suit up quickly
at home base...

01:11:50.879 --> 01:11:53.347
...I'm concerned how you would handle it
in the field.

01:11:53.515 --> 01:11:54.743
Perhaps he's primping.

01:11:54.917 --> 01:11:58.910
As I recall, Master Richard spent nearly
half an hour admiring his reflection...

01:11:59.088 --> 01:12:01.352
...the first time he donned his cape.

01:12:02.057 --> 01:12:05.458
Jason, get on out here
or I'm going on patrol without you.

01:12:05.627 --> 01:12:07.720
- Ha!
- My word.

01:12:07.896 --> 01:12:09.193
- Gotcha.
- Would have...

01:12:09.365 --> 01:12:13.199
...if I hadn't seen you slip behind
the computer banks three minutes ago.

01:12:13.369 --> 01:12:16.361
- No, I got you.
- How does it feel?

01:12:18.474 --> 01:12:20.965
It feels awesome.

01:12:21.143 --> 01:12:24.442
Check me out.
I'm Robin, the Boy wonder.

01:12:24.613 --> 01:12:27.104
Are you kidding me? This rocks.

01:12:27.282 --> 01:12:30.945
Come on, old man, we've got bad guys
who need chasing.

01:12:35.491 --> 01:12:38.426
This is the best day of my life.

01:12:39.305 --> 01:12:45.340
