(car engine revs)

00:23.220 --> 00:26.770
(country music playing)

00:26.770 --> 00:32.520
Welcome back to the story
of maybe the most famous
marriage in Nashville:

00:32.520 --> 00:35.220
George Jones
and Tammy Wynette.

00:35.220 --> 00:37.600
They first got together
when country was blowing up,

00:37.600 --> 00:40.430
crossing over
into the mainstream culture.

00:40.430 --> 00:42.930
Some of their biggest hits
were about marriage,

00:42.930 --> 00:45.470
even when their own
was falling apart.

00:45.470 --> 00:50.180

00:51.640 --> 00:57.390
♪ We're gonna hold on ♪

00:57.390 --> 01:01.980
♪ To each other ♪

01:01.980 --> 01:05.600
The marriage
didn't last long,
about six years,

01:05.600 --> 01:09.060
but they kept producing
big hits for decades.

01:09.060 --> 01:10.560
Despite death threats,

01:10.560 --> 01:13.180
drug problems,
and new spouses,

01:13.180 --> 01:16.140
they always seemed to find
their way back to each other.

01:16.140 --> 01:18.980
I got to witness a little
of this near the end.

01:18.980 --> 01:20.180
Tammy did the voice

01:20.180 --> 01:22.390
of Hank Hill's mom
on King of the Hill.

01:22.390 --> 01:24.810
Don't tell me
you're uncomfortable
with the thought

01:24.810 --> 01:27.140
of me and Gary sleeping
in the same room.

01:27.140 --> 01:29.020
I didn't have
that thought, Mom.

01:29.020 --> 01:30.470
You put
that thought in my--

01:30.470 --> 01:34.390
And I heard from her
that George could do
a mean Donald Duck,

01:34.390 --> 01:37.350
under certain conditions.

01:37.350 --> 01:38.850
We'll get to that later.

01:38.850 --> 01:40.890
(theme music playing)

01:54.020 --> 01:55.680
Tammy was a beautiful lady,

01:55.680 --> 01:58.060
and George was a great man.

01:58.060 --> 02:01.390
He just had... some demons.

02:01.390 --> 02:02.640
You knew when he was messed up

02:02.640 --> 02:04.680
when he didn't have
that hair sprayed down.

02:04.680 --> 02:06.680
That hair would get
all over his face,

02:06.680 --> 02:07.980
I mean, everywhere.

02:07.980 --> 02:10.890
But when he was straight,
he was so particular.

02:10.890 --> 02:13.890
He would use
a whole can of hairspray.

02:13.890 --> 02:15.890
It would be so stiff,
I said, "George,

02:15.890 --> 02:17.730
a bug couldn't even fly
on your head."

02:17.730 --> 02:19.730
Mike:
Wayne Oliver
was 20 years old

02:19.730 --> 02:22.890
when George and Tammy
got married and started
performing together.

02:22.890 --> 02:25.890
He spent much of his career
booking their shows.

02:25.890 --> 02:27.930
We were playing
up in Washington, DC,

02:27.930 --> 02:30.270
and we were headed
to Logan, Ohio.

02:30.270 --> 02:32.850
I said, "George, let's go.
Let's go to the hotel,
spend the night.

02:32.850 --> 02:35.930
We'll fly there in the morning."
He said, "No, I wanna
ride the bus."

02:35.930 --> 02:38.560
I said, "Uh-oh."
When he said he wanted
to ride the bus

02:38.560 --> 02:40.390
and didn't fly,
I knew something
was going on.

02:40.390 --> 02:42.600
So I told the bus driver
and the band,

02:42.600 --> 02:45.890
I said,
"Don't let him off the bus
till you get to Logan, Ohio."

02:45.890 --> 02:48.020
♪ ♪

02:48.020 --> 02:51.350
So the next morning,
all the band members were
standing around the bus,

02:51.350 --> 02:54.140
and I said, "What's wrong?"
They said, "George is gone."

02:54.140 --> 02:57.930
I said, "What?"
They said, "Yeah,
we woke up and he was gone."

02:57.930 --> 03:00.270
I said, "Shit, we've got
this show out here,

03:00.270 --> 03:02.520
and it's gonna be
25,000 to 30,000 people."

03:02.520 --> 03:05.270
And they said, "Well,
he was walking down thataway."

03:05.270 --> 03:06.980
So I went down there, walking,

03:06.980 --> 03:10.430
and I seen two little ladies
out in the front yard.

03:10.430 --> 03:13.270
And I said, "Ma'am,
have y'all seen George Jones?"

03:13.270 --> 03:17.390
She said,
"Well, he just left.
Nicest man in the world.

03:17.390 --> 03:20.470
Fact, we had
two bottles of wine."
I said, "What?"

03:20.470 --> 03:22.890
She said, "Yeah,"
said, "He come by,
and he was thirsty."

03:22.890 --> 03:24.930
And I said,
"Can you tell me
where he went?"

03:24.930 --> 03:28.220
She said, "Well,
he was gonna go right down
here to the cab stand."

03:28.220 --> 03:29.640
I said,
"Thank you very much."

03:29.640 --> 03:32.220
So I went down there
and the cab driver
said, "Yeah."

03:32.220 --> 03:34.560
He said, "George got
in a cab about an hour ago.

03:34.560 --> 03:35.640
Said he's headed to Nashville."

03:35.640 --> 03:37.680
I said, "Holy shit.
George is gone."

03:37.680 --> 03:39.390
I said, "I don't know
what we're gonna do."

03:39.390 --> 03:42.850
And you seen
those people had been
out there all day, drinking.

03:42.850 --> 03:45.270
And we'd seen
some pretty nice fights,

03:45.270 --> 03:47.810
and I said, "Look,
we've got a little problem."

03:47.810 --> 03:49.640
I said, "George is gone."

03:49.640 --> 03:52.060
And there was a DJ standing
over on the other side.

03:52.060 --> 03:54.220
He heard me say that,
and he went up on the stage

03:54.220 --> 03:57.270
and said,
"George Jones is gone.
There's not gonna be a show."

03:57.270 --> 04:01.060
And I said, "Damn it."
People were tearing
the stages down.

04:01.060 --> 04:03.100
They were throwing rocks
at the bus,

04:03.100 --> 04:05.060
cutting the tires on the bus.

04:05.060 --> 04:07.470
Lucky, I had a .38
with me in my briefcase.

04:07.470 --> 04:09.470
And just happened,

04:09.470 --> 04:11.560
a lot of Hell's Angels
come to the show.

04:11.560 --> 04:14.350
And I recognized one of 'em,
and I motioned for him
to come over.

04:14.350 --> 04:15.680
And he come
to the side of the bus,

04:15.680 --> 04:17.600
I said, "Spook, you gotta
get our ass out of here.

04:17.600 --> 04:18.890
They're gonna kill all of us."

04:18.890 --> 04:20.770
He come over
on the motorcycles.

04:20.770 --> 04:25.180
We went out
of there on the rims.
The tires had come off.

04:25.180 --> 04:26.810
A little later on,
I got a phone call

04:26.810 --> 04:30.520
that he was checked
in the Holiday Inn there
in Panama City.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.470
George always thought
I had a bug on him,

04:32.470 --> 04:34.310
because I could find him
anywhere he went.

04:34.310 --> 04:38.350
And he would love
to go to some cheap hotel,

04:38.350 --> 04:40.140
just stay in there
and eat fried chicken

04:40.140 --> 04:43.220
and drink two or three fifths
of Evan Williams Whiskey.

04:43.220 --> 04:45.060
I'll never 'get. I went
and knocked on the door,

04:45.060 --> 04:49.100
and I said, "Room Service."
And he says, "I knew
you'd find me."

04:49.100 --> 04:51.810
So I got him washed
and got that hair
sprayed down,

04:51.810 --> 04:54.390
and we come back
to Logan, Ohio.

04:54.390 --> 04:57.810
And he went out there
and done about a two
and a half hour show.

04:57.810 --> 04:59.850
He apologized
to the crowd he missed.

04:59.850 --> 05:01.060
He said, "You know how I am."

05:01.060 --> 05:02.890
Said, "I wanna thank
those two little old ladies

05:02.890 --> 05:05.520
for giving me
those two bottles
of wine we dranked."

05:05.520 --> 05:07.730
I mean when Jones
turned it on,

05:07.730 --> 05:10.270
there was nobody
could touch him, brother.

Mike:
George's talent was
giant, indisputable.

05:37.770 --> 05:40.100
His commitment was
another thing.

05:40.100 --> 05:42.600
His wife, Tammy,
and all those
who worked with him

05:42.600 --> 05:44.270
were enamored by his voice,

05:44.270 --> 05:47.270
but also living
at the mercy of his drinking.

05:47.270 --> 05:48.730
Nanette:
She would laugh
about it then...

05:48.730 --> 05:51.100
(Janette laughs)
...but it was so horrendous

05:51.100 --> 05:54.600
that he was so drunk,
and he was wrecking
the house.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.270
And she was afraid
he was gonna go out

05:56.270 --> 05:58.310
and get in the car,
and have a car accident
or whatever.

05:58.310 --> 06:01.560
Mike:
Janette and Nanette
Smith, sisters,

06:01.560 --> 06:04.520
rode the bus with George
and Tammy for years,

06:04.520 --> 06:07.890
doing hair and makeup
on the road and in the studio.

06:07.890 --> 06:13.430
This was probably during
the gypsy shag era.

06:13.430 --> 06:15.470
This would be
a little up-do for her.

06:15.470 --> 06:17.640
This is called
a page boy.

06:17.640 --> 06:21.220
Mike: The Smith sisters
weren't allowed to touch
George's hair.

06:21.220 --> 06:22.850
That was Tammy's job.

06:22.850 --> 06:24.850
I'd say, "George,
do you want me to do your hair?"

06:24.850 --> 06:26.600
"No, I'll wait on
my hairdresser.

06:26.600 --> 06:28.310
(laughs)
Tammy's hair.

06:28.310 --> 06:32.980
Mike: The girls would,
however, conspire with Tammy
to keep Jones off the bottle.

06:32.980 --> 06:35.810
Tammy calls me and she said
to George at home,

06:35.810 --> 06:39.310
"George, that was Jan.
Her yardman is sick,
she needs a yardman.

06:39.310 --> 06:42.680
You know how
that yard of hers is.
It can't go a week. Da-da-da."

06:42.680 --> 06:45.020
So she calls me
in a few minutes,
and she says,

06:45.020 --> 06:47.140
"Don't get near a window.
Don't get near a door.

06:47.140 --> 06:50.850
Don't peep out,
but when you get a chance,
look at your yardman."

06:50.850 --> 06:53.770
I look out.
George Jones
is out there

06:53.770 --> 06:56.350
in a wifebeater,
a pair of shorts,

06:56.350 --> 06:58.560
some tennis shoes,
a ball cap,

06:58.560 --> 07:01.560
taking all of his rakes,
cutters and things
out of his car.

07:01.560 --> 07:03.980
He didn't give a damn.
He wanted to be a yardman.

07:03.980 --> 07:07.930
Janette:
He worked on my yard
for three hours.

07:07.930 --> 07:10.350
It was more perfect
than it ever has been.

07:10.350 --> 07:13.020
And he had a big
number-one record then.

07:13.020 --> 07:14.810
So when he started
to get in the truck
and leave,

07:14.810 --> 07:16.220
I opened the door
and I was like,

07:16.220 --> 07:19.850
"Aren't you gonna
autograph it?"
He was like...

07:20.980 --> 07:22.180
(laughs)

07:22.180 --> 07:23.850
Tammy called me
and asked me

07:23.850 --> 07:25.770
to come and look for him.

07:25.770 --> 07:27.140
I found him one time,

07:27.140 --> 07:28.600
12 or one o'clock at night,

07:28.600 --> 07:30.520
I found him on
one of those back roads

07:30.520 --> 07:32.980
when he'd pulled over
to throw up.

07:32.980 --> 07:34.850
He was hanging
out of the car,

07:34.850 --> 07:38.520
his head almost touching
the ground, passed out,

07:38.520 --> 07:41.350
with the door open
and the car running.

07:41.350 --> 07:44.390
I think I might have saved
his life at that time.

07:44.390 --> 07:47.560
Tammy finally got fed up
with George's drinking,

07:47.560 --> 07:50.850
and to retaliate,
she had fed him
some poisoned food.

07:50.850 --> 07:52.640
And it was
moldy cornbread,

07:52.640 --> 07:54.430
sour beans,
and rotten potatoes.

07:54.430 --> 07:57.730
George got to throwing up
for a few days

07:57.730 --> 07:59.430
and had stomach problems,

07:59.430 --> 08:01.140
and he said that
she poisoned him,

08:01.140 --> 08:03.430
'cause was going
to collect that insurance.

08:03.430 --> 08:07.560
And I said, "George,
you know, it could've been
something you eat."

08:07.560 --> 08:10.180
This is the sort of thing
that Tammy had to endure,

08:10.180 --> 08:13.600
because there
was no controlling Jones,
and he just didn't give a shit.

08:13.600 --> 08:17.060
Mike: You may recall
gonzo journalist,
Jimmy McDonough,

08:17.060 --> 08:20.770
one of the last
to interview Tammy
about her time with George.

08:20.770 --> 08:22.770
At one point, Tammy alleges

08:22.770 --> 08:24.810
that George came home
from a bender,

08:24.810 --> 08:26.850
he threw a punch
at her and missed.

08:26.850 --> 08:29.930
She got him into bed,
and he woke up

08:29.930 --> 08:31.680
and proceeded to go berserk.

08:31.680 --> 08:35.520
She said he pointed
a rifle in her direction
and fired at her...

08:35.520 --> 08:36.560
(gunshot)

08:36.560 --> 08:39.600
...and destroyed
the contents of the house.

08:39.600 --> 08:42.600
(gunfire)

08:42.600 --> 08:45.180
I got there,
and he is wilder than a buck,

08:45.180 --> 08:46.770
had hair everywhere.

08:46.770 --> 08:48.430
Finally, we took
the gun away from him,

08:48.430 --> 08:50.850
and he said,
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I don't know why I did it."

08:50.850 --> 08:54.060
Jimmy:
He ended up being dragged
away in a straight jacket,

08:54.060 --> 08:56.850
where he spent
10 days drying out.

08:56.850 --> 08:58.980
Tammy reached
her end point.

08:58.980 --> 09:02.770
I have never seen
a more terrified human being,

09:02.770 --> 09:05.810
but she--
by golly, she did it.

09:05.810 --> 09:08.060
Jimmy:
That was the end.

09:08.060 --> 09:09.770
Tammy wouldn't
let him come home,

09:09.770 --> 09:12.310
and the marriage was over.

09:12.310 --> 09:14.180
The great storybook romance

09:14.180 --> 09:17.640
that Tammy dreamed of
was no more.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.600
Mike:
The split had ramifications

09:19.600 --> 09:22.470
beyond their love
for each other
and the children.

09:22.470 --> 09:25.060
Having Mr. and Mrs.
Country Music break up,

09:25.060 --> 09:27.810
well, that's bad for business.

09:27.810 --> 09:29.810
No question about whether or not

09:29.810 --> 09:31.310
her career or his career

09:31.310 --> 09:33.180
might be hurt by their divorce,

09:33.180 --> 09:36.060
and of course,
how to divide up the band.

09:36.060 --> 09:38.390
Mike:
The Jones Boys--
real brothers,

09:38.390 --> 09:40.640
Don, Gary,
and Arnie Adams--

09:40.640 --> 09:43.270
had been with George
and Tammy from the beginning,

09:43.270 --> 09:46.730
alongside a rotating door
of fellow Jones boys,

09:46.730 --> 09:50.100
musicians like
singer-songwriter
Johnny Paycheck

09:50.100 --> 09:52.270
and George's closest friend,

09:52.270 --> 09:55.310
songwriter and guitar player,
Peanutt Montgomery.

09:55.310 --> 09:57.730
When I was a Jones Boy,
traveling with him,

09:57.730 --> 09:59.680
I drank beer, you know.

09:59.680 --> 10:02.850
I never could understand
how George could drink

10:02.850 --> 10:06.470
and sit for six or eight hours
and never go to the bathroom.

10:06.470 --> 10:09.520
You know,
he must've been
wearing Depends.

10:09.520 --> 10:11.430
(both laugh)

10:11.430 --> 10:13.680
Peanutt:
Sometimes he'd lock
the bathroom door,

10:13.680 --> 10:16.180
you know, when I needed
to use the bathroom.

10:16.180 --> 10:17.470
I broke him of that.

10:17.470 --> 10:20.020
I'd go back in his bedroom
and pee on the floor.

10:21.430 --> 10:22.770
Mike:
When the marriage ended,

10:22.770 --> 10:25.060
the situation
on the road changed.

10:25.060 --> 10:27.350
How did the Jones boys

10:27.350 --> 10:28.470
end up with Tammy?

10:28.470 --> 10:30.980
That was in the divorce.
Oh, okay, yeah.

10:30.980 --> 10:32.890
Tammy got custody of the band.

10:32.890 --> 10:34.020
(guys laugh)

10:34.020 --> 10:36.060
The band all went
with Tammy,

10:36.060 --> 10:37.680
the bus went with Tammy,

10:37.680 --> 10:40.390
because she was the one
that they could depend on,

10:40.390 --> 10:41.980
and they actually liked her.

10:41.980 --> 10:45.640
Mike: In 1976, Tammy went
back out on the road

10:45.640 --> 10:48.730
without George Jones
for the first time in years.

10:48.730 --> 10:53.350
We're on the bus,
and Tammy said,
"What if nobody comes?"

10:53.350 --> 10:57.020
We all fell out laughing,
'cause she thought they were
coming to see George Jones.

10:57.020 --> 10:59.730
She was so scared
every night.

10:59.730 --> 11:01.640
"What if nobody shows up?

11:01.640 --> 11:03.520
What if they want Jones
to be here?"

11:03.520 --> 11:07.020
(crowd shouting)
Janette: They kept screaming,
"Where's George?"

11:07.020 --> 11:10.100
And James Holly--
He was
the bass player.

11:10.100 --> 11:11.810
And he went up
to the microphone and said,

11:11.810 --> 11:13.350
"We don't know
where George is,

11:13.350 --> 11:15.430
and he doesn't either."
"And he doesn't either."
(chuckles)

11:15.430 --> 11:18.100
After the divorce,
certain of George's fans

11:18.100 --> 11:20.220
wanted to vent
their anger at Tammy,

11:20.220 --> 11:23.310
and she was,
in some cases, ridiculed.

11:23.310 --> 11:26.270
She was pretty gutsy.
She was real gutsy.

11:26.270 --> 11:28.730
If we could've
just excluded men
from her life,

11:28.730 --> 11:32.060
she'd still be alive
and be the biggest star
in the world.

11:32.060 --> 11:34.770
After Tammy left George,
George was a mess.

11:34.770 --> 11:36.390
We'd hunt, we'd camp out.

11:36.390 --> 11:38.020
He just liked to do things.

11:38.020 --> 11:41.020
He threw out
in the river one day
and caught a little bitty bream,

11:41.020 --> 11:44.020
and he said,
"Oh, Peanutt, the fish are out
in the middle of the river."

11:44.020 --> 11:45.430
That was not
a bream he caught.

11:45.430 --> 11:47.770
He caught a catfish
about this long.

11:47.770 --> 11:51.810
Anyway, when he'd
go fishing, it wound up
costing him a fortune.

11:51.810 --> 11:53.470
Said, "We gotta
go get a boat."

11:53.470 --> 11:57.220
So they took off
to the sporting goods place
and bought a boat.

11:57.220 --> 11:59.350
And then he realized
he had to have something
to pull it with,

11:59.350 --> 12:02.060
so they went down
to the Chevrolet place
and bought a new truck.

12:02.060 --> 12:05.430
He sent me
to the grocery store
to get folding chairs,

12:05.430 --> 12:08.140
and cooking pots
and pans, and food.

12:08.140 --> 12:09.980
♪ ♪

12:09.980 --> 12:12.680
And so we got the truck
and the boat all together,

12:12.680 --> 12:14.020
and pulled it down
to the river.

12:14.020 --> 12:16.890
He'd dig a hole and put corn--

12:16.890 --> 12:19.350
wrap it up in tin foil,
bury it in the ground,

12:19.350 --> 12:22.770
and build a fire
in there on coals
and roast that corn.

12:22.770 --> 12:25.520
I don't know where he learned
to do all this stuff.
Indians.

12:26.850 --> 12:28.680
Mike:
With the exception
of the expense,

12:28.680 --> 12:31.470
these nature sojourns
worked out pretty well,

12:31.470 --> 12:35.520
until Peanutt found God
and decided to get sober.

12:35.520 --> 12:37.680
George went the other way.

12:37.680 --> 12:40.310
By then, he'd begun
playing music again

12:40.310 --> 12:43.270
with his only connection
to Tammy, the Jones Boys.

12:43.270 --> 12:46.730
George would jerk out
a bag of cocaine there,

12:46.730 --> 12:50.390
and then he would
just get completely
stoned, totally.

12:50.390 --> 12:52.680
Mike:
This newfound high
apparently caused

12:52.680 --> 12:55.100
some kind of psychotic break
in George,

12:55.100 --> 12:57.680
which lead
to multiple personalities--

12:57.680 --> 13:02.220
well, two personalities:
The duck and the old man.

13:02.220 --> 13:04.470
The duck came first.
Yeah.

13:04.470 --> 13:07.270
And the old man
came later, so he'd have
somebody to talk to.

13:07.270 --> 13:10.020
Gary:
He'd sit up all night long,
sitting in there in the bed,

13:10.020 --> 13:12.470
and he would be talking
in the Donald Duck voice.

13:12.470 --> 13:14.890
When he'd get in a car
and he was drinking,

13:14.890 --> 13:16.890
he would talk
like Donald Duck.

13:16.890 --> 13:18.270
(mimics Donald Duck)

13:18.270 --> 13:19.770
Then he'd talk
like the old man.

13:19.770 --> 13:21.680
I don't believe in it.
It ain't natural.

13:21.680 --> 13:24.600
And then they'd get in a fight,
and then he'd get between them.

13:24.600 --> 13:27.310
If the good Lord
meant for us to read,
we'd be born knowing how!

13:27.310 --> 13:28.890
(mimics Donald Duck)

13:28.890 --> 13:31.560
Wayne: And he wouldn't
be paying no attention
where he was going.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.390
You know, George had
a lot of wrecks.

13:33.390 --> 13:35.850
(mimics Donald Duck moaning)
(car horn moos)

13:35.850 --> 13:37.560
One day,
we were on the bus,

13:37.560 --> 13:39.390
going down the road
with the band,

13:39.390 --> 13:41.980
and he decided he wanted
to get rid of the duck,

13:41.980 --> 13:44.600
so he kicked him
off the bus.
(Duck voice) No, no, no, no!

13:44.600 --> 13:46.390
Charlene:
And he went on down
the road a while,

13:46.390 --> 13:48.140
and he got
to worrying about it.

13:48.140 --> 13:50.390
He'd done kicked
the duck off the bus,

13:50.390 --> 13:52.390
and it was his best friend.

13:52.390 --> 13:53.890
So he made
the driver turn around,

13:53.890 --> 13:55.930
and go back
and pick up the duck,

13:55.930 --> 13:57.680
put him back on the bus.

13:57.680 --> 14:00.430
(mimics Donald Duck)

14:00.430 --> 14:02.640
That's when we--
we convinced ourselves,

14:02.640 --> 14:04.470
"Boys, we've got
to do something with him."

14:04.470 --> 14:06.560
"You know, we can't
go on with you, uh,

14:06.560 --> 14:10.430
being so distraught over Tammy,
and you can't even perform."

14:10.430 --> 14:13.430
And we convinced him
that he should sign up
with Tammy

14:13.430 --> 14:17.060
just so he could
be back somewhere
in association with her.

14:17.060 --> 14:21.640
One song that George
and Tammy did after the divorce
was "Golden Rings."

14:21.640 --> 14:22.930
It was a true story.

14:22.930 --> 14:25.390
They have a ring
they found in a pawn shop,

14:25.390 --> 14:27.730
and ended up
with a broken marriage.

14:27.730 --> 14:30.350
And I think that affected
the fans greatly

14:30.350 --> 14:33.850
because it had
so much personal
tragedy in it.

of a variety of men
courting his ex-wife.
(applause)

15:55.680 --> 15:57.520
Tammy Wynette
had to be in love,

15:57.520 --> 16:00.640
and it was very easy
for her to get a man,

16:00.640 --> 16:02.980

Tammy Wynette.

16:02.980 --> 16:04.850

There was a guy
that drove our bus.

I dated Michael Tomlin,
she married him.

16:13.100 --> 16:14.600
She stole all my boyfriends.

16:14.600 --> 16:17.520
One of the people
that she fell in love with
was Burt Reynolds.

16:17.520 --> 16:20.060
Burt Reynolds
had a horse ranch
in Jupiter, Florida,

16:20.060 --> 16:24.770
so Tammy decided
that she wanted to buy
a second house to be near Burt.

16:24.770 --> 16:26.770
When she fell in love
with somebody,

16:26.770 --> 16:29.890
she would pursue it

She was pursued
publicly as well

16:32.220 --> 16:33.680
by the rich
and the powerful,

16:33.680 --> 16:37.060
who just wanted to be seen
as the man by her side.

16:37.060 --> 16:41.270
Every politician in the world
wanted to stand there singing,
"Stand By Your Man."

16:41.270 --> 16:43.270
So one day, she's standing
by the side of George Wallace,

16:43.270 --> 16:46.060
and the next day,
she's standing
beside Ronald Reagan.

16:46.060 --> 16:47.730
Well, we're
in Jackson, Mississippi,

16:47.730 --> 16:51.020
and Ronald Reagan would
always kiss her on the cheek
at the end of the song.

16:51.020 --> 16:53.180
Well, Ronald Reagan
kissed her in the mouth.

16:53.180 --> 16:58.020
She come off, she's furious.
She went, "He swabbed
my tonsils, Jan.

16:58.020 --> 17:02.100
He almost gagged me.
I am putting an end to this."

17:02.100 --> 17:04.600
And she got
this huge red dress

17:04.600 --> 17:06.470
that she was gonna wear
to the White House.

17:06.470 --> 17:10.060
So she goes on the stage,
she does "Stand By Your Man"
at the end.

17:10.060 --> 17:13.560
Well, she usually goes out
in the audience and gets
a man to stand by.

17:13.560 --> 17:16.100
The president is
sitting there, just grinning,

17:16.100 --> 17:17.930
with his wife
sitting by him,

17:17.930 --> 17:19.930
and everybody knew
how jealous she was.

17:19.930 --> 17:24.430
And all of a sudden,
Tammy sits down in his lap,
puts her arm around his neck.

17:24.430 --> 17:27.310
The Secret Service perks up,
everybody perks up.

17:27.310 --> 17:29.810
I thought I was gonna die.

17:29.810 --> 17:31.680
Then they go
in the dressing room,
and she said,

17:31.680 --> 17:33.810
"Bet I don't have to stand
by him anymore."

17:33.810 --> 17:35.980
(laughing)

17:35.980 --> 17:38.680
Mike:
The seemingly endless string
of men in her life,

17:38.680 --> 17:41.180
of course,
fueled George's demons,

17:41.180 --> 17:43.730
but Tammy had
her own peculiar problems,

17:43.730 --> 17:46.980
according to their daughter,
Tamala Georgette Jones.

17:46.980 --> 17:48.220
We started having death threats

17:48.220 --> 17:50.560
on my grandparents,
on me, on my mom.

17:50.560 --> 17:51.890
We went bowling one night,

17:51.890 --> 17:53.810
and someone had broken
into our house

17:53.810 --> 17:55.890
and turned on every
faucet and bathtub,

17:55.890 --> 17:58.310
so that when we got home,
our entire house was flooded.

17:58.310 --> 18:01.560
And on every TV and mirror,
any type of reflective surface,

18:01.560 --> 18:05.520
they had taken red lipstick
and written, "Slut, whore, pig,"

18:05.520 --> 18:07.060
all throughout the entire house.

18:07.060 --> 18:10.680
Multiple instances
like this that had happened
over several months.

18:10.680 --> 18:13.600
My assumption was always
that it had been

18:13.600 --> 18:16.680
a disgruntled fan
of George Jones'

18:16.680 --> 18:19.770
who was mad at Tammy
for divorcing George.

18:19.770 --> 18:21.180
She asked me to come over,

18:21.180 --> 18:23.520
and she had thoughtfully
provided me a shotgun,

18:23.520 --> 18:25.270
which I placed under the bed

18:25.270 --> 18:27.560
in case some prowler
came through,

18:27.560 --> 18:28.680
but nothing happened.

18:28.680 --> 18:30.520
And the same thing
the next night,

18:30.520 --> 18:31.850
nothing happened,

18:31.850 --> 18:34.350
so I didn't go back over there
to spend the night anymore,

18:34.350 --> 18:36.350
but a few days later,

18:36.350 --> 18:38.220
somebody firebombed the house.

18:38.220 --> 18:39.430
(shatters)

18:39.430 --> 18:40.890
Georgette:
I was in my mom's bedroom,

18:40.890 --> 18:42.220
and the house
caught on fire there,

18:42.220 --> 18:43.930
and the whole back
of the house burned down.

18:43.930 --> 18:45.850
Tennessee fire marshal decided

18:45.850 --> 18:49.310
to have polygraph tests
of everybody that
had been there.

18:49.310 --> 18:54.220
And they tested Tammy,
said, "She might have had
something to do with this."

18:54.220 --> 18:58.020
And they tested her daughters,
who were teenagers at best.

18:58.020 --> 18:59.770
And each time
they would test one,

18:59.770 --> 19:02.100
they'd say,
"She did it. We've got it."

19:02.100 --> 19:04.730
Then they tested
her mother, Mildred.

19:04.730 --> 19:07.220
"Mildred must have had
something to do with this."

19:07.220 --> 19:10.100
And her grandmother,
who could hardly walk,

19:10.100 --> 19:11.890
and said, "She was involved."

19:11.890 --> 19:17.220
After that,
I became very skeptical
of any polygraph test.

19:17.220 --> 19:21.310
All sorts of bizarre,
unexplained incidents happened
in Tammy's life.

19:21.310 --> 19:23.640
You know,
there's the alleged kidnapping.

19:23.640 --> 19:25.600
No one was
ever arrested in that.

19:25.600 --> 19:27.730
There was always people
out to get her

19:27.730 --> 19:30.390
or some espionage around Tammy,

19:30.390 --> 19:33.430
which was never really,
uh, explained away.

19:33.430 --> 19:36.730
Mike:
Tammy would eventually
remarry yet another manager

19:36.730 --> 19:40.810
and develop
her own lethal addiction
to prescription pain killers.

19:40.810 --> 19:43.850
George hit his own rock bottom
after losing Tammy,

19:43.850 --> 19:45.980
the duck, the old man,

19:45.980 --> 19:47.680
and then losing
his best friend,

19:47.680 --> 19:50.180
Peanutt Montgomery,
to organized religion.

19:50.180 --> 19:53.930
George was really upset
because Peanutt had
become a Christian.

19:53.930 --> 19:55.930
He was jealous
of Jesus.

19:55.930 --> 19:58.020
Charlene:
George began
to get mad at Peanutt,

19:58.020 --> 20:02.100
because he wouldn't
go do concerts,
wouldn't go places to gamble,

20:02.100 --> 20:04.810
so I was at home,
and George called the house.

20:04.810 --> 20:06.350
He said,
"Where's Little Jesus?"

20:06.350 --> 20:08.770
I said, "George,
what do you mean?"

20:08.770 --> 20:11.140
"You know what I mean.
Where's Little Jesus?

20:11.140 --> 20:13.520
"I want to get him down,
I'm gonna pull his beard out,

20:13.520 --> 20:16.060
one by one
with some tweezers."

20:16.060 --> 20:17.810
And I'd just hang up on him.
Well, after a while,

20:17.810 --> 20:20.390
Peanutt called me
and said they got to talking.

20:20.390 --> 20:23.310
And George asked Peanutt
to meet him down
at Cypress Creek.

20:23.310 --> 20:25.470
When I got down there,
he was down there.

20:25.470 --> 20:28.350
I pulled up there,
and he was sitting there
with the window down.

20:28.350 --> 20:31.390
And I pulled up beside him,
and I rolled my window down

20:31.390 --> 20:34.430
and hung my arms out
just like that, you know.

20:34.430 --> 20:36.890
I said, "George, what are
you persecuting me for?"

20:36.890 --> 20:40.020
He said,
"People just don't know
what I go through with."

20:40.020 --> 20:43.310
And all at once,
he just reached out beside him
and got that pistol.

20:43.310 --> 20:46.980
And he said, "I'm gonna see
if you're old God can save you
now, you m-f'er."

20:46.980 --> 20:48.890
That's what he said,
the very words...

20:48.890 --> 20:50.600
only he said the word.

20:50.600 --> 20:53.350
And he shot at me,
pow, like that.

20:54.270 --> 20:56.850
He missed me,
and then he pulled

20:56.850 --> 20:59.890
that trigger back
on that .38 again.
I could hear it.

20:59.890 --> 21:02.560
He just looked
at me like this, he said,

21:02.560 --> 21:05.810
"Well, Peanutt,
I'm going to the house,"

21:05.810 --> 21:08.770
like nothing
had ever happened.
Just like that.

21:08.770 --> 21:11.310
He let his window up,
drove off.

21:11.310 --> 21:15.520
I went to the sheriff.
I said, "George Jones
just took a shot at me,

21:15.520 --> 21:17.100
tried to kill me."

21:17.100 --> 21:20.850
I had one guy who took
his knife and dug the bullet
out of the door.

21:20.850 --> 21:22.850
My friend was
the district attorney.

21:22.850 --> 21:25.930
We all partied together
and stuff, and he told me,

21:25.930 --> 21:28.350
"Well, you know,
he'll go off with 15 years,"

21:28.350 --> 21:31.310
he said, "because
that's attempted murder.
That's a felony.

21:31.310 --> 21:32.890
"If you want to pursue him

21:32.890 --> 21:35.390
and convict him,
I'll convict him."

21:35.390 --> 21:38.850
But I dropped charges on him.
I dropped the charges.

21:38.850 --> 21:42.220
Mike:
Believe it or not, there is
a happy ending to this story,

21:42.220 --> 21:45.390
but it's probably not the one
you're used to hearing.

21:45.390 --> 21:48.180
We put him in the hospital
and dried him out.

21:48.180 --> 21:53.310
And, uh, he called me, at home,
after about four or five weeks.

21:53.310 --> 21:55.980
He said, "I wanted
to know if you'd do
an album with me?"

21:55.980 --> 21:58.060
I said,
"Yeah, I'd be glad to."

21:58.060 --> 22:00.270
He said, "I know
we ain't got no money now,

22:00.270 --> 22:02.600
"and things ain't looking good,
but if you'll stay with me,

22:02.600 --> 22:05.310
I've got a song that's
gonna bring us out of this."

22:05.310 --> 22:08.220
He had such confidence,
it convinced us.

22:08.220 --> 22:11.020
"Okay, George,
then you need
to get in there.

22:11.020 --> 22:12.770
"Go to the studio,
you know,

22:12.770 --> 22:15.680
and get your voice back,
get your brain back,
and record that."
