01:13.732 --> 01:17.109
U.S.A. naval Operation Swordplay.
Integrate phase two.

01:17.110 --> 01:19.610
Commence launch.

01:21.364 --> 01:23.864
Confirming clearance.

01:25.285 --> 01:27.785
Unit Charlie, fire.

01:34.252 --> 01:35.544
Here they come.

01:35.545 --> 01:37.296
Delta flight leader in position.

01:37.297 --> 01:39.797
Commence air attack.

01:43.678 --> 01:46.222
Assault force incoming, sir.

01:46.389 --> 01:48.473
They're coming onto a mined beach.

01:48.474 --> 01:50.767
And all those mines
have gotta go, right?

01:50.768 --> 01:53.020
Here's where we shine.

01:53.021 --> 01:56.482
SEAL Unit Bravo, target Nexus.

01:57.066 --> 01:58.442
Go.

01:58.443 --> 02:01.383
SEAL Unit Bravo, confirming drop.

02:04.615 --> 02:07.034
The enemy assaulted the beach
with a string of Iandmines.

02:07.035 --> 02:09.911
Our job is to go in and take out
the control centre

02:09.912 --> 02:11.663
which controls
and activates those mines.

02:11.664 --> 02:13.749
One man is gonna do all that?

02:13.750 --> 02:15.917
He just Ieads the point.
The others will follow.

02:15.918 --> 02:18.418
Here they come now.

02:19.422 --> 02:22.465
They'II come in and Iay charges
on the mine control centre.

02:22.466 --> 02:25.468
It's Iinked to a whole beach-Ioad
of explosives.

02:25.469 --> 02:27.012
So when the control centre blows

02:27.013 --> 02:29.389
all the rest of the mines
on the beach go with it?

02:29.390 --> 02:31.808
Right. One clean beach
for the Marines.

02:31.809 --> 02:35.103
They Iove to follow in our footsteps.

02:35.104 --> 02:36.855
How Iong before it blows?

02:36.856 --> 02:39.356
Should be any second now.

02:46.782 --> 02:48.908
Well, they certainly did it.

02:48.909 --> 02:50.702
Half the beach is blowing up.

02:50.703 --> 02:52.996
Instead of half the assault force.

02:52.997 --> 02:55.497
Here they come.

02:56.041 --> 02:57.584
Control centre destroyed.

02:57.585 --> 02:59.377
Assault forces on the beach.

02:59.378 --> 03:01.129
Come on, come on, come on.

03:01.130 --> 03:03.630
Move it.

03:04.383 --> 03:06.634
Primary assault target secured.

03:06.635 --> 03:08.678
Navy SEALs, well done.

03:08.679 --> 03:10.638
Thank you, sir.

03:10.639 --> 03:14.559
SEAL Unit Bravo One,
terminate and recover.

03:30.284 --> 03:32.201
You know,
everything you've shown us here today

03:32.202 --> 03:33.578
is absolutely top calibre.

03:33.579 --> 03:35.413
So why do you need us?

03:35.414 --> 03:38.207
Well, believe me, it's not easy asking.

03:38.208 --> 03:40.084
The Navy SEALs
are supposed to handle anything

03:40.085 --> 03:43.004
from air-sea-Iand assault
to underwater demolition,

03:43.005 --> 03:45.131
not pass our headaches on.

03:45.132 --> 03:47.592
But...

03:47.593 --> 03:51.262
...two crimes in three weeks
and we're getting blamed.

03:51.263 --> 03:55.133
Because these thieves
used SEAL techniques.

03:56.101 --> 03:57.977
The newspapers are implying
SEALs are involved.

03:57.978 --> 03:59.520
You have checked your men?

03:59.521 --> 04:02.815
I know my men. No SEAL
is involved in these robberies.

04:02.816 --> 04:04.775
But we are getting smeared
in the media.

04:04.776 --> 04:06.152
What about police?

04:06.153 --> 04:07.361
They're getting nowhere.

04:07.362 --> 04:09.488
And Iegally, the military
can't become involved

04:09.489 --> 04:11.615
in tracking a civilian crime.

04:11.616 --> 04:14.996
That's why I'm asking for your help.

04:15.453 --> 04:17.370
You got it.

04:17.372 --> 04:18.622
Where do we start?

04:18.623 --> 04:20.791
We wait until they hit the next time.

04:20.791 --> 04:22.710
I know they're gonna try it again.

04:22.711 --> 04:26.411
That's when you jump in
with both feet.

04:32.887 --> 04:34.430
That's the dive boat, all right.

04:34.431 --> 04:35.806
Don't get too close.

04:35.807 --> 04:37.641
Yeah, they found something.

04:37.642 --> 04:40.602
Let me see.
Give me the binocs.

04:41.312 --> 04:43.147
That radio chatter we heard
is for real.

04:43.148 --> 04:44.815
They brought up
some kind of treasure.

04:44.816 --> 04:46.608
Good.

04:46.609 --> 04:48.152
Hit them right now.

04:48.153 --> 04:50.445
- Don't forget to wait for my signal.
- Right, Gar.

04:50.446 --> 04:52.281
Let's go. Now, remember,

04:52.282 --> 04:54.408
first the signal balloon,
then the assault.

04:54.409 --> 04:56.326
We should have total surprise
on our side.

04:56.327 --> 04:58.704
- You got me?
- Yeah.

04:58.705 --> 05:01.164
AII the seams are sealed with pitch.

05:01.165 --> 05:04.584
There's a chance
that everything inside is preserved.

05:04.585 --> 05:06.586
Knock on wood.

05:06.587 --> 05:09.716
Well, Iet's find out.

05:15.263 --> 05:17.763
- Ready?
- Let's do it.

05:26.566 --> 05:29.192
Do you think this came from
the treasure fleet?

05:29.193 --> 05:31.027
Look, I've read all
the contemporary accounts

05:31.028 --> 05:33.405
and analysed all the manifests.

05:33.406 --> 05:38.886
I know everything there is to know
about the Nuestra Señora.

05:43.082 --> 05:45.942
Well, keep your fingers crossed.

05:56.220 --> 05:58.221
Oh, dear God, it's real.

05:58.222 --> 06:00.473
Fantastic.

06:00.474 --> 06:03.254
Look at this jewelled crucifix.

06:03.269 --> 06:05.228
This is a gold cob.

06:05.229 --> 06:10.199
1712 on its way back to Spain
on the Nuestra Señora.

06:22.287 --> 06:23.621
Look at this.

06:23.622 --> 06:26.642
Government papers out of Monterey.

06:31.296 --> 06:35.801
Look, this has to be the ship's
document box.

06:36.426 --> 06:41.056
Well, it all Iooks Iike
it's in perfect condition.

06:41.598 --> 06:43.266
What is it?

06:43.267 --> 06:45.268
It's the Iog.

06:45.269 --> 06:47.270
The ship's Iog.

06:47.271 --> 06:51.524
If this has the course corrections,
it's the Iast clue we need.

06:51.525 --> 06:57.375
Oh, Paul, we could be this close
to finding the entire treasure.

07:03.995 --> 07:08.457
Let's get all this forward,
away from this mess.

07:08.458 --> 07:13.108
Come on. We've got all the time
in the world now.

07:26.810 --> 07:29.061
It's an 8 escudo cob.

07:29.062 --> 07:33.852
The reign of Philip V
from his royal treasure fleet.

07:48.998 --> 07:51.918
Look, off the port bow.

07:57.674 --> 07:59.842
What is it?

07:59.843 --> 08:04.603
It's a signal balloon.
Could be a diver in trouble.

08:15.983 --> 08:18.483
Come on, Iet's haul it up.

08:41.299 --> 08:43.009
What's the matter?

08:43.010 --> 08:45.510
It's anchored.

08:51.227 --> 08:54.854
If it's a diver, he's sure caught
in something down there.

08:54.855 --> 08:59.318
AII right.
Stay still, stay quiet, stay alive.

09:00.027 --> 09:02.821
Don't touch that.
It took us years to find it.

09:02.822 --> 09:05.073
The ship's Iog
isn't worth anything to you.

09:05.074 --> 09:08.674
- Stay back.
- Get your hands off that.

09:09.161 --> 09:10.411
Get them below.

09:10.412 --> 09:12.957
Come on, move it!

09:15.626 --> 09:18.587
Go on, I said. Move it.

09:25.552 --> 09:29.072
- No! No!
- AII right, get them below.

09:45.823 --> 09:48.867
Stay down or you're dead.

10:12.641 --> 10:14.850
Listen.

10:14.851 --> 10:17.812
I ripped out the radio. They won't be
calling anybody from out here.

10:17.813 --> 10:19.605
Good. Go grab the treasure.

10:19.606 --> 10:22.106
Right.

10:24.861 --> 10:27.279
Could be the Coast Guard.

10:27.280 --> 10:30.449
No, the Coast Guard
would hail them down.

10:30.450 --> 10:33.700
It has to be the pirates' own boat.

10:34.329 --> 10:36.829
He's alongside.

10:37.666 --> 10:39.667
Hey, those SEAL tactics
really worked.

10:39.668 --> 10:42.168
Like cream.

10:42.462 --> 10:44.962
Barb, careful.

10:48.134 --> 10:49.760
AII right, you in there.

10:49.761 --> 10:52.261
Stay below.

10:54.516 --> 10:57.016
Come on.

10:59.020 --> 11:03.690
- Barbara, don't. They'II shoot you.
- I wanna be able to identify them.

11:03.691 --> 11:06.191
Get down!

11:12.951 --> 11:14.660
You can't go out there.

11:14.661 --> 11:16.203
They took the treasure we found.

11:16.204 --> 11:20.654
Even the Iog.
Twelve years of research destroyed.

11:24.087 --> 11:27.339
The pirates hit again, and Pete set up
a meeting with the victim

11:27.340 --> 11:29.549
at the Ortega Research Centre.

11:29.550 --> 11:32.386
Barbara Ortega?

11:33.012 --> 11:35.222
Name's MacGyver.
Phoenix Foundation.

11:35.223 --> 11:37.474
Oh, yes, I know
the Phoenix Foundation, of course,

11:37.475 --> 11:39.935
but I don't know exactly what you do,
Mr. MacGyver.

11:39.936 --> 11:41.311
Just MacGyver.

11:41.312 --> 11:44.439
I just kind of fix things
around the place, that's all.

11:44.440 --> 11:47.880
Do you fix bullet-riddled boat cabins?

11:48.694 --> 11:51.655
I was kind of hoping to do
a Iittle more than that.

11:51.656 --> 11:53.448
Can we talk?

11:53.449 --> 11:54.991
Sure.

11:54.992 --> 11:57.786
But I don't think
I can tell you anything worthwhile.

11:57.787 --> 12:00.413
Why don't we start with
what you told the police?

12:00.414 --> 12:03.875
That was a gruelling three hours
of retracing everything I did

12:03.876 --> 12:06.294
and everything I've seen
in the past week.

12:06.295 --> 12:08.129
What about your offshore dives?

12:08.130 --> 12:09.589
Like I told the police,

12:09.590 --> 12:12.425
we found pieces of treasure
two days running.

12:12.426 --> 12:14.552
But I trust my crew implicitly

12:14.553 --> 12:16.721
and they're the only ones
who knew about the find.

12:16.722 --> 12:18.556
The folks at the museum?

12:18.557 --> 12:21.017
We told no one.

12:21.018 --> 12:23.770
What about the pirates?
Did you get a good Iook at them?

12:23.771 --> 12:27.273
I didn't see their faces or their boat.

12:27.274 --> 12:29.484
Like I said, I'm not much help, am I?

12:29.485 --> 12:30.777
Yeah, sure you are.

12:30.778 --> 12:35.258
You're eliminating possibilities.
That's progress.

12:36.909 --> 12:39.494
I'm not into trade-ins, Gar.

12:39.495 --> 12:41.120
Come on.

12:41.121 --> 12:42.747
It's part of the deal.

12:42.748 --> 12:45.584
Our boat's worth 75,000 easy.

12:45.751 --> 12:48.377
Besides, it's down payment
on this sweet thing.

12:48.378 --> 12:50.213
You run a boatyard, Arne.

12:50.214 --> 12:52.507
You can sell a cigarette boat
for a good price.

12:52.508 --> 12:55.468
And you can keep anything
over the 75,000.

12:55.469 --> 12:57.887
Okay. Then tell me
what's wrong with her.

12:57.888 --> 13:00.557
Nothing, Arne, nothing.

13:00.724 --> 13:04.185
She's fast, she's hot.
We had a Iot of fun with her.

13:04.186 --> 13:07.563
But we wanna do something else.
Change our Iuck.

13:07.564 --> 13:10.150
Okay. Let me Iook it over.

13:13.612 --> 13:16.697
Hey, why trade our cigarette boat
for this?

13:16.698 --> 13:19.450
We used it three times,
now we dump it.

13:19.451 --> 13:21.160
You think he'II buy it?

13:21.161 --> 13:23.496
He'II go for the deal.

13:23.497 --> 13:25.873
Once we got this baby
out on the open ocean

13:25.874 --> 13:27.666
we are gone.

13:27.667 --> 13:31.427
No passport checks,
no trails, no traces.

13:31.463 --> 13:34.798
And enough money to Iast us
for a couple of years.

13:34.799 --> 13:36.926
Yeah, maybe.

13:36.927 --> 13:39.470
But how do we turn
a Iot of old gold into cash?

13:39.471 --> 13:42.181
Don't I always have the answers?

13:42.182 --> 13:43.724
We're gonna ask an expert.

13:43.725 --> 13:45.434
Doctor Barbara Ortega.

13:45.435 --> 13:46.935
That'II be quite a rush,

13:46.936 --> 13:49.647
asking her how to cash in
on her own treasure.

13:49.648 --> 13:52.066
Gar, you've run those engines
pretty hard,

13:52.067 --> 13:53.525
but she's not bad.

13:53.526 --> 13:55.694
- You got yourself a deal.
- Great.

13:55.695 --> 13:58.906
Look, I gotta go to an appointment,
so the guys will handle all the details.

13:58.907 --> 14:00.365
- Okay.
- Come on, guys.

14:00.366 --> 14:02.866
Let's take her for a ride.

14:05.038 --> 14:08.332
We've each exhausted every possibility
I can think of to identify them.

14:08.333 --> 14:11.543
AII right, now, wait a minute.
Let's not give up yet.

14:11.544 --> 14:13.837
Stolen artefacts.
What do you figure they're worth?

14:13.838 --> 14:17.966
Priceless in terms of knowledge.
And then there's the material value.

14:17.967 --> 14:20.470
Here, Iet me show you.

14:21.804 --> 14:23.722
Now, these were parts
of a shipment of treasure

14:23.723 --> 14:26.058
out of Monterey bound for Spain.

14:26.059 --> 14:29.144
They've told us a Iot
about Spanish colonial trade routes.

14:29.145 --> 14:31.188
I got a hunch these guys
weren't too interested

14:31.189 --> 14:34.129
in Spanish colonial trade routes.

14:34.233 --> 14:36.568
How much have
you collected so far?

14:36.569 --> 14:38.737
About 30 or $40,000 worth.

14:38.738 --> 14:40.572
Yesterday was our first real find.

14:40.573 --> 14:42.073
But it was stolen.

14:42.074 --> 14:44.367
I was gonna sell most of it.

14:44.368 --> 14:46.620
Boy, did I ever need that money.

14:46.621 --> 14:48.413
Excuse me.

14:48.414 --> 14:51.249
You sound Iike you know a Iot
about this stuff.

14:51.250 --> 14:53.293
How much would
one of these be worth?

14:53.294 --> 14:55.795
Roughly $1,000 to a collector.

14:55.796 --> 14:57.422
A bit Iess to a dealer.

14:57.423 --> 14:58.715
Dealer?

14:58.716 --> 15:01.259
You mean I could go
and buy one of these?

15:01.260 --> 15:04.346
- Where would I do that?
- The Treasure Coin Corporation

15:04.347 --> 15:06.723
or Cortez Antique Coins
right here in town.

15:06.724 --> 15:09.809
Well, thank you.
I really appreciate it.

15:09.810 --> 15:12.310
Sorry for the interruption.

15:12.646 --> 15:16.566
So is that how you plan to cash in
on your gold if you find it?

15:16.567 --> 15:18.943
Well, not exactly.

15:18.944 --> 15:20.904
My father and I spent 12 years

15:20.905 --> 15:24.365
searching for the Spanish
treasure fleet.

15:24.366 --> 15:27.744
He found pieces of one ship
and drowned,

15:27.745 --> 15:30.245
caught inside the wreckage.

15:30.247 --> 15:32.123
I'm sorry.

15:32.124 --> 15:35.001
I was with him
and I couldn't help him.

15:35.002 --> 15:38.042
But I can finish what he started.

15:38.172 --> 15:40.465
And try to justify his death.

15:40.466 --> 15:42.592
By finding the fleet?

15:42.593 --> 15:46.637
My father's wish was to return
the treasure to its rightful owners.

15:46.638 --> 15:49.724
The people of what was
Spanish America.

15:49.725 --> 15:53.102
To set up hospitals
and set up schools.

15:53.103 --> 15:55.603
Give back what's theirs.

15:56.023 --> 15:59.650
Yesterday, I had the key
to the treasure in my hands:

15:59.651 --> 16:02.151
The captain's Iog.

16:02.654 --> 16:05.448
You have any idea
how much that Iog is worth?

16:05.449 --> 16:10.161
Two ships carrying an estimated
$60 million worth of treasure.

16:10.162 --> 16:13.164
Now, all I need
are those daily course corrections

16:13.165 --> 16:15.833
and I'm positive that
I can find that fleet.

16:15.834 --> 16:17.251
That's kind of funny.

16:17.252 --> 16:19.921
- What?
- Well, the pirates.

16:20.088 --> 16:25.858
They haven't got the slightest idea
what they've really stolen.

16:34.060 --> 16:39.090
AII we wanna do now, Barbara,
is stimulate your memory.

16:39.733 --> 16:41.275
I don't understand.

16:41.276 --> 16:42.860
Well, you were below decks.

16:42.861 --> 16:45.112
You couldn't see anything.
You were blind, right?

16:45.113 --> 16:46.697
Effectively, yes.

16:46.698 --> 16:50.868
But you still had all your other senses
working for you, especially hearing.

16:50.869 --> 16:53.287
AII right, Iet's go back there.
You're down below

16:53.288 --> 16:55.205
and you can hear
their boat's engine.

16:55.206 --> 16:58.417
Try to remember
that particular sound you heard, okay?

16:58.418 --> 17:00.918
AII right.

17:03.173 --> 17:05.673
No, too high-pitched.

17:07.676 --> 17:10.176
No.

17:10.930 --> 17:12.222
Wait.

17:12.223 --> 17:13.557
No.

17:13.558 --> 17:15.684
They all seem to sound
a Iittle bit alike

17:15.685 --> 17:18.185
but not the right one.

17:20.481 --> 17:22.981
No.

17:23.401 --> 17:24.609
Hold it.

17:24.611 --> 17:27.905
- This one?
- The one before.

17:28.071 --> 17:30.575
It had a heavier sound.

17:34.078 --> 17:36.638
That's it. That's the boat.

17:38.124 --> 17:39.958
Smuggler's boat. Oceangoing.

17:39.959 --> 17:41.960
Very high speed. It fits.

17:41.961 --> 17:44.296
See, I told you we'd get to it.

17:44.297 --> 17:47.707
Now we've got something
to Iook for.

17:49.927 --> 17:52.762
How much do you think
all this treasure is worth?

17:52.763 --> 17:55.307
Two hundred thousand,
maybe a quarter of a million.

17:55.308 --> 17:56.600
So be careful.

17:56.601 --> 17:59.477
By the time we're finished, you could
bounce these cans off a bulkhead

17:59.478 --> 18:01.104
without scratching any of the gold.

18:01.105 --> 18:03.189
We're packing it Iike eggshells.

18:03.190 --> 18:06.693
So, Gar, what else did you hear
this Ortega broad say?

18:06.694 --> 18:09.404
Okay. The next thing she says is

18:09.405 --> 18:13.783
the one we took is just the tip
of the treasure chest.

18:13.784 --> 18:17.036
That the bad guys don't even know
what they've got.

18:17.037 --> 18:21.000
There's 60 million bucks right here.

18:21.167 --> 18:22.917
In this captain's Iog.

18:22.918 --> 18:26.088
Now, I don't read OId Spanish...

18:26.255 --> 18:29.215
...but Dr. Barbara Ortega, she can.

18:29.216 --> 18:31.050
Come on, Gar.
We made one hell of a hit.

18:31.051 --> 18:33.551
Hey, we got nothing.

18:33.554 --> 18:36.598
Enough for a couple of years
of easy Iiving.

18:36.599 --> 18:38.850
This could be
for the rest of our Iives.

18:38.851 --> 18:40.935
Big time.

18:40.936 --> 18:43.980
What I want you to do as soon
as you finish stuffing the cans,

18:43.981 --> 18:46.107
is to get a Iine on her,
Iike where she Iives,

18:46.108 --> 18:48.568
where she works,
what time she gets off work.

18:48.569 --> 18:51.320
Don't you think
we're pushing it a Iittle?

18:51.321 --> 18:53.030
We take the ketch out.

18:53.031 --> 18:58.453
If we have Dr. Ortega along,
we got a handle on $60 million.

18:58.454 --> 18:59.829
You get Iife for kidnapping.

18:59.830 --> 19:02.498
It's not pushing it,
it's out over the edge!

19:02.499 --> 19:06.939
Being on the edge
is how you know you're alive.

19:08.255 --> 19:10.798
That's her.
I'II find out when she'II be Ieaving.

19:10.799 --> 19:13.969
Maybe we can give the Iady a Iift.

19:18.515 --> 19:21.059
- Barbara.
- Hi.

19:21.226 --> 19:24.770
Good timing. I was just giving some
distinguished guests a Iook around.

19:24.771 --> 19:27.481
MacGyver, meet Señorita--
Come here.

19:27.482 --> 19:28.899
-- EIena Echeverria.

19:28.900 --> 19:31.944
- Hi.
- And Señor Christobel Santos.

19:31.945 --> 19:34.445
My pleasure.

19:37.868 --> 19:39.618
Your boyfriend?

19:39.619 --> 19:42.119
No.

19:44.499 --> 19:46.709
You're right. It is a shame.

19:46.710 --> 19:49.837
And you two have
to get back to the clinic, pronto.

19:49.838 --> 19:52.338
Adios, MacGyver.

19:55.218 --> 19:57.803
- What happened to them?
- War.

19:57.804 --> 19:59.388
EIena was burned in a raid

19:59.389 --> 20:01.640
and Christobel's knee
was shattered by a bullet.

20:01.641 --> 20:03.308
We don't even know
from which side.

20:03.309 --> 20:07.020
We hope that the surgery
he's scheduled for will repair his Ieg.

20:07.021 --> 20:09.815
You see, these kids are the reason
the treasure is so important.

20:09.816 --> 20:11.567
Then we better find it, huh?

20:11.568 --> 20:13.735
Speaking of which,
your message said something about

20:13.736 --> 20:15.612
having information
on the cigarette boat.

20:15.613 --> 20:17.948
I posted a $5,000 reward.

20:17.949 --> 20:20.909
My office got a phone call
early this morning while I was out.

20:20.910 --> 20:23.537
A man named Arne Lindquist
said he would call back.

20:23.538 --> 20:27.688
He owns a boatyard.
That's all he would say.

20:30.920 --> 20:33.420
Get me some more paint.

20:41.097 --> 20:43.557
Hey, Arne...

20:43.558 --> 20:44.933
...is she ready yet?

20:44.934 --> 20:48.186
Well, the...
The rigging needs a Iittle tune.

20:48.187 --> 20:49.604
Give me a couple more hours, huh?

20:49.605 --> 20:51.481
Sure, sure, no problem.

20:51.482 --> 20:54.651
By the way,
did you sell our cigarette boat yet?

20:54.652 --> 20:56.903
Not yet, but there's some interest.

20:56.904 --> 20:58.572
Good, good.

20:58.573 --> 21:01.823
Let me pay you off right now, okay?

21:05.746 --> 21:09.124
And I was worried about a kidnapping?
This is heavy-duty, Gar.

21:09.125 --> 21:10.458
You sweat too much.

21:10.459 --> 21:13.837
Get him aboard.
We'II dump him at sea.

21:13.838 --> 21:15.714
- We gonna put out right away?
- Not yet.

21:15.715 --> 21:17.257
Not until we pick up our passenger.

21:17.258 --> 21:18.800
You're not going after that girl.

21:18.801 --> 21:20.301
We don't have to.

21:20.302 --> 21:22.802
She's coming to us.

21:26.434 --> 21:28.893
This Lindquist
should have called hours ago.

21:28.894 --> 21:31.604
We may have to do without him.

21:31.605 --> 21:33.064
There are five cigarette boats

21:33.065 --> 21:35.149
registered as docked
in Marina del Rey.

21:35.150 --> 21:36.401
So?

21:36.402 --> 21:38.111
So that's where
we start Iooking tomorrow

21:38.112 --> 21:39.737
if Lindquist falls through.

21:39.738 --> 21:43.908
Then I guess that's where
we start Iooking tomorrow.

21:43.909 --> 21:46.244
Yeah.

21:46.245 --> 21:47.829
Yeah.

21:47.830 --> 21:51.000
Call forwarding for Dr. Ortega.

21:53.836 --> 21:55.169
This is Barbara Ortega.

21:55.170 --> 21:58.000
Dr. Ortega, I'm Arne Lindquist.

21:58.048 --> 22:00.174
You called about the cigarette boat?

22:00.175 --> 22:02.844
That's right.
I think I know where it is.

22:02.845 --> 22:05.345
Oh,that's wonderful. Where?

22:05.431 --> 22:07.390
If you'II come to my boatyard,
I'II show you.

22:07.391 --> 22:09.350
We're at 6th and Pacific.

22:09.351 --> 22:12.101
- Say, in an hour?
- An hour?

22:12.604 --> 22:15.481
Of course.
Do you mind if I bring a friend along?

22:15.482 --> 22:17.108
He's also interested in the boat.

22:17.109 --> 22:18.317
Fine.

22:18.318 --> 22:19.860
I'II be waiting for both of you.

22:19.861 --> 22:22.614
Good. Goodbye.

22:25.033 --> 22:28.620
You see?
How could it be any easier?

22:41.258 --> 22:42.591
Mr. Lindquist?

22:42.592 --> 22:44.343
- I'm Barbara Ortega.
- You found me.

22:44.344 --> 22:46.844
We can talk inside.

22:51.226 --> 22:53.726
Right this way.

22:55.355 --> 22:58.665
- This is my friend, MacGyver.
- Hi.

22:58.692 --> 23:00.401
So you're Iooking
for a cigarette boat?

23:00.402 --> 23:03.112
Yes. It may be connected
to the piracy of my boat.

23:03.113 --> 23:05.613
No question, Dr. Ortega.

23:06.032 --> 23:08.532
It is connected.

23:09.119 --> 23:10.994
Hey, you were in
the museum yesterday.

23:10.995 --> 23:13.555
You came right on up to us.

23:13.748 --> 23:15.833
You Iike to gamble a Iittle, don't you?

23:15.834 --> 23:17.584
Well, I Iike to win.

23:17.585 --> 23:20.587
- What do you want from us?
- First, I want the girl.

23:20.588 --> 23:22.756
Then I want the rest
of the Spanish treasure.

23:22.757 --> 23:24.800
- No.
- Unfortunately,

23:24.801 --> 23:27.428
we don't need you, MacGyver.

23:29.931 --> 23:32.599
Hold it, right there. Come on, now.

23:32.600 --> 23:35.894
You know, you guys are missing out
on a great deal if you kill me.

23:35.895 --> 23:37.437
I can help you.

23:37.438 --> 23:40.399
See, I'm kind of an expert
with just about everything

23:40.400 --> 23:43.276
and I can handle
all kinds of machinery.

23:43.277 --> 23:45.320
I know a Iot about all this stuff.

23:45.321 --> 23:51.291
In fact, I used to do a Iot
of salvage diving when I was a kid.

23:56.624 --> 23:59.124
Run. Get help.

23:59.460 --> 24:01.960
Get them!

24:13.057 --> 24:15.557
There he goes.

24:55.724 --> 24:59.084
Hold it.
Manning may want him alive.

25:01.188 --> 25:05.638
- What was that?
- Sounds Iike he went overboard.

25:11.406 --> 25:15.106
- I don't see him.
- He's staying down.

25:17.412 --> 25:21.012
He jumped in.
He's swimming underwater.

25:25.087 --> 25:26.754
That's just what
he wants us to think.

25:26.755 --> 25:28.464
CIose that hatch and Iock it.

25:28.465 --> 25:30.965
Get her aboard the ketch.

25:31.760 --> 25:34.260
Let's go. Let's go.

25:38.517 --> 25:41.977
Cast off.
I'II send her friend to the bottom.

25:41.978 --> 25:43.854
Have a good trip, MacGyver.

25:43.855 --> 25:48.105
It'II be a real rush
all the way to the end.

25:50.362 --> 25:52.738
You can't Ieave him in there.
He'II drown.

25:52.739 --> 25:54.782
Just keep moving.

25:54.783 --> 25:58.833
Get her below
and get those engines started.

26:14.135 --> 26:17.179
Hatch was locked down
and I was locked in...

26:17.180 --> 26:20.380
...with a lot of water for company.

26:39.244 --> 26:42.496
The hatch was locked down,
the water was rising.

26:42.497 --> 26:44.748
It was tight and getting tighter.

26:44.749 --> 26:47.249
I needed a way out, fast.

27:04.060 --> 27:07.150
All I had to work with was water.

27:09.440 --> 27:12.693
And maybe this bilge pump.

27:14.153 --> 27:18.943
Normally, a bilge pump
shoves water out of the boat.

27:25.998 --> 27:30.168
But if I pumped water
into one of these boat bumpers,

27:30.169 --> 27:34.239
I just might have a way
to crack the hatch.

27:50.522 --> 27:54.892
The angle brace made
my hydraulic jack complete.

28:24.723 --> 28:26.307
It was working.

28:26.308 --> 28:29.638
All I needed was a little more time.

28:36.193 --> 28:37.818
There was a problem.

28:37.819 --> 28:41.113
My hydraulic jack
didn't stand up to the pressure.

28:41.114 --> 28:44.444
I was starting to wonder if I could.

28:47.996 --> 28:52.386
I had about one minute
to find another way out.

28:58.840 --> 29:01.468
A tank of compressed gas.

29:07.849 --> 29:10.517
If it had a minimum
2, 000 pounds of pressure

29:10.518 --> 29:14.104
and if I could release it
all in one shot,

29:14.105 --> 29:16.900
I just might have a chance.

30:19.337 --> 30:21.671
What do you mean
there are no sightings?

30:21.672 --> 30:25.822
A 58-foot ketch
can't disappear in thin air.

30:27.970 --> 30:30.513
Well, the Coast Guard says
it can't be in Iocal waters.

30:30.514 --> 30:32.515
Well, the ketch that's missing
from the boatyard

30:32.516 --> 30:34.017
can barely make
nine knots an hour.

30:34.018 --> 30:36.644
Well, he kidnapped Barbara
for one reason, the treasure fleet.

30:36.645 --> 30:39.439
And that's not far offshore,
so it's gotta be within that area.

30:39.440 --> 30:43.026
Well, the coastline has been checked.
Every cove, port and harbour.

30:43.027 --> 30:45.445
What about offshore? The islands?

30:45.446 --> 30:48.114
Yeah, Catalina, negative.
Anacapa, negative.

30:48.115 --> 30:49.616
Santa Cora, negative.

30:49.617 --> 30:52.410
They even searched around
Sanchez Rock and Goat Island.

30:52.411 --> 30:55.081
Negative. And that's the Iot.

30:55.664 --> 30:57.957
You know, my ID on Manning

30:57.958 --> 30:59.959
turned up some pretty ugly history,

30:59.960 --> 31:03.046
including an application
for a Navy SEAL assignment.

31:03.047 --> 31:06.883
Yeah. He did great on the physicals,
but he failed all the character tests.

31:06.884 --> 31:09.886
Kind of tells the story of why he chose
to smear your outfit, doesn't it?

31:09.887 --> 31:13.681
And it's still not over. Not until
we find him and Dr. Ortega.

31:13.682 --> 31:16.100
You said they searched
around Goat Island.

31:16.101 --> 31:18.561
- They didn't Iand?
- It's a target island.

31:18.562 --> 31:20.646
The Navy uses it
for gunnery practice.

31:20.647 --> 31:23.191
Nothing alive on it
except some unexploded ammo.

31:23.192 --> 31:26.903
Think that'd keep a risk-taker
Iike Manning away from it?

31:26.904 --> 31:30.072
MacGyver, Goat Island
is a piece of hell.

31:30.073 --> 31:32.909
BIasted dirt, Iive mines,
shell craters.

31:32.910 --> 31:34.994
Nobody's allowed
within three miles of it.

31:34.995 --> 31:36.871
Well, that would make it
perfect for him.

31:36.872 --> 31:38.247
So how do we get on the island?

31:38.248 --> 31:41.125
You can't. It's absolutely off-Iimits.

31:41.126 --> 31:42.710
Get permission.

31:42.711 --> 31:44.837
Look, I'm off duty.

31:44.838 --> 31:47.590
I'm here strictly
as an unofficial advisor.

31:47.591 --> 31:50.631
And I'm advising you:
Forget it.

32:03.815 --> 32:07.693
There. We can begin the turn
in about 30 seconds.

32:07.694 --> 32:10.905
Then hold her steady
until MacGyver's out of sight.

32:10.906 --> 32:13.406
MacGyver.

32:13.575 --> 32:15.242
Have you got the transmitter?

32:15.243 --> 32:16.910
Yeah, right here.

32:16.911 --> 32:18.162
Now, don't be a hero.

32:18.163 --> 32:20.623
Just get the girl if you can
and come on back.

32:20.624 --> 32:22.541
Pete, you know me.

32:22.542 --> 32:25.210
As soon as I get the girl,
I'II run Iike crazy.

32:25.211 --> 32:26.962
Then we'II send a signal.

32:26.963 --> 32:29.048
We'II be waiting with full backup.

32:29.049 --> 32:31.559
Yeah, if they're out there.

32:31.718 --> 32:34.218
Ready? Make this Iook good.

32:51.195 --> 32:53.781
AII right, go.

33:14.343 --> 33:16.178
What was it?

33:16.179 --> 33:19.432
Nothing, Gar. Sport fisher.

33:28.316 --> 33:33.186
Survey party in sector six,
send a report in, please.

33:33.821 --> 33:37.198
So how close are we
to the treasure fleet?

33:37.199 --> 33:40.201
Look, getting inside the mind
of a Spanish sea captain

33:40.202 --> 33:43.371
who died 250 years ago
takes a Iittle time.

33:43.372 --> 33:45.790
Hey, I'm in no rush.

33:45.791 --> 33:47.709
Roger. Return to base.

33:47.710 --> 33:51.296
Sounds Iike they're about
to give up the search and go home.

33:51.297 --> 33:53.840
Our ketch is in a cove, camouflaged.

33:53.841 --> 33:56.342
And on top of everything else,

33:56.343 --> 34:00.203
they'II never Iook for us
in a minefield.

34:00.973 --> 34:02.891
So take your time.

34:02.892 --> 34:04.601
AII the time you want.

34:04.602 --> 34:07.102
But find me that treasure.

34:09.398 --> 34:12.900
I had to hit the beach fast and quiet,

34:12.900 --> 34:16.405
without any gear slowing me down.

35:29.811 --> 35:32.563
Interesting thing about explosives.

35:32.564 --> 35:35.692
They decay, become real touchy...

35:35.859 --> 35:38.359
... unless you get lucky.

35:40.196 --> 35:41.613
There goes another one.

35:41.614 --> 35:43.157
It's just another rabbit for dinner.

35:43.158 --> 35:45.909
I don't Iike this place.
It's Iike camping in a combat zone.

35:45.910 --> 35:50.460
Neither does anybody else.
That's why we're here.

35:53.459 --> 35:54.877
The only place they could be

35:54.878 --> 35:58.005
was in one of the island's
abandoned artillery bunkers.

35:58.006 --> 36:01.446
The question was where
and which one.

36:20.153 --> 36:22.653
Antipersonnel mine.

36:22.864 --> 36:25.533
First click armed it.

36:27.201 --> 36:31.831
Not many people ever get to hear
the second click.

36:39.171 --> 36:41.256
The trick for surviving this situation

36:41.257 --> 36:45.552
was making sure
the mine's switch didn't click twice.

36:45.553 --> 36:48.673
The first click is a simple hello.

36:48.681 --> 36:52.768
The second is a serious goodbye.

37:18.085 --> 37:23.925
As long as I kept the wire taut,
the mine wasn't gonna go off.

38:09.761 --> 38:12.264
They gotta be kidding.

38:13.014 --> 38:15.844
This place is land-mine heaven.

38:22.983 --> 38:24.817
More rabbit stew?

38:24.818 --> 38:26.860
Those damned bombs.

38:26.861 --> 38:28.821
That, gentlemen, was a Iandmine.

38:28.822 --> 38:30.864
Could have been the one
I set this morning.

38:30.865 --> 38:33.365
Let me see your glasses.

38:37.163 --> 38:39.663
Go and check it out.

38:40.917 --> 38:44.587
Rogan. Both of you.

38:49.884 --> 38:53.762
The detonator on this landmine
was a little different.

38:53.763 --> 38:56.673
Pressure on the button armed it.

38:57.308 --> 39:00.811
Now, if I could just wedge
the button down tight,

39:00.812 --> 39:04.592
I might be able
to survive this one too.

40:32.611 --> 40:37.574
Light, rusted and hollow
as an old tin can.

40:37.741 --> 40:39.450
It was obviously a dud.

40:39.451 --> 40:41.619
The thing was...

40:41.620 --> 40:44.289
... only I knew that.

40:53.882 --> 40:56.382
It's just a rock.

40:57.135 --> 40:59.635
You go that way.

41:02.099 --> 41:08.029
Bet you Iiked it better when you
were knocking off Iiquor stores.

41:18.990 --> 41:21.490
Oh, my God.

41:21.993 --> 41:24.579
Bell. Bell.

41:25.789 --> 41:28.123
Don't move.

41:28.124 --> 41:29.667
Don't turn around.

41:29.668 --> 41:32.168
Lose the gun.

41:32.170 --> 41:34.171
- Lose it!
- Okay. Okay.

41:34.172 --> 41:35.714
- Now, give me your belt.
- What for?

41:35.715 --> 41:38.215
Just do it.

41:38.218 --> 41:40.718
Come on.

41:43.098 --> 41:44.807
What are you doing?

41:44.808 --> 41:46.266
Never mind me.

41:46.267 --> 41:49.997
Just make sure
you keep that Iine tight.

41:54.984 --> 41:57.484
I don't blame you.

41:58.655 --> 42:00.489
What?

42:00.490 --> 42:04.460
There's somebody
on the island hunting you.

42:08.706 --> 42:14.526
It's too bad. I'm getting close
to Iocating the treasure fleet.

42:14.837 --> 42:16.713
Just find it.

42:16.714 --> 42:19.049
Nobody's gonna get past Bell.

42:19.050 --> 42:21.770
He's an artist with that Uzi.

43:16.524 --> 43:19.024
Jack?

43:37.378 --> 43:38.961
Bell!

43:38.962 --> 43:41.462
Bell!

43:49.139 --> 43:53.060
Okay, you boys stay put now.

43:53.227 --> 43:55.979
There's Iive mines out there.

44:29.429 --> 44:32.359
It's all going wrong, isn't it?

44:32.432 --> 44:37.270
Not for Iong, it isn't. Get up.

44:56.873 --> 45:00.667
AII right, that ought to do it.
You can Iet her go now.

45:00.668 --> 45:02.127
MacGyver.

45:02.128 --> 45:05.465
Ah, yes, MacGyver, the fool.

45:05.632 --> 45:07.966
You know something?

45:07.967 --> 45:11.261
I figure this ought to even
things between us.

45:11.262 --> 45:13.597
You see, if you shoot me, I fall.

45:13.598 --> 45:14.932
Then we all go up.

45:14.933 --> 45:16.975
Yeah, but you'II kill the girl too.

45:16.976 --> 45:19.729
Yeah. Sorry, Barbara.

45:19.896 --> 45:21.813
Just as Iong as you get him.

45:21.814 --> 45:24.149
You both that crazy?

45:24.150 --> 45:26.861
You got it. Catch.

45:30.740 --> 45:33.510
Don't drop it! Don't drop it!

45:39.999 --> 45:42.499
MacGyver.

45:42.585 --> 45:45.755
It's no problem. Just a dud.

45:47.423 --> 45:53.113
Hey, you gotta be careful
with these things. You can get hurt.

46:00.811 --> 46:02.937
Breakaway. Set it up,
Christobel, set it up.

46:02.938 --> 46:05.607
There's the break.
He shoots, he scores!

46:05.608 --> 46:07.692
Unbelievable.

46:07.693 --> 46:10.946
I'd say you won. Good work.

46:13.657 --> 46:17.967
Yeah, it's gotta feel good
to walk again, huh?

46:18.537 --> 46:22.373
He's asked that before,
about the other kids who need help.

46:22.374 --> 46:26.127
You see, he's the reason why we have
to find the rest of the treasure.

46:26.128 --> 46:27.378
As a matter of fact,

46:27.379 --> 46:31.883
the Phoenix Foundation
owed me a bonus and I have collected.

46:31.884 --> 46:33.176
Pete's out right now

46:33.177 --> 46:35.803
arranging for the Ioan
of a top-of-the-Iine dive boat.

46:35.804 --> 46:39.557
The one we picked out
can handle up to about 50 divers.

46:39.558 --> 46:42.143
Well, MacGyver, that's wonderful,

46:42.144 --> 46:46.454
but we can't afford five divers,
much Iess 50.

46:47.524 --> 46:49.984
What friends of yours?

46:49.985 --> 46:53.362
I took Chris around to visit
some of my buddies in the SEALs.

46:53.363 --> 46:56.657
And they're kind of happy
about having their name cleared.

46:56.658 --> 47:01.204
So far, about 83 of the best divers
in the country have volunteered.

47:01.205 --> 47:03.206
Eighty-three?

47:03.207 --> 47:05.918
I'd say help was on the way.
