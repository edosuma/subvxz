WEBVTT

00:00.948 --> 00:04.342
I'm not going to annihilate
4.3 million Pakistanis

00:04.485 --> 00:07.292
without hearing from someone
whose authority I recognize.

00:07.376 --> 00:08.815
Our own people
tried to sink us?

00:08.949 --> 00:09.863
We have commandeered

00:10.031 --> 00:11.086
the NATO early warning station

00:11.192 --> 00:12.547
on the island of Sainte Marina.

00:12.667 --> 00:14.813
I am declaring
a 200-mile no-man's-land

00:14.919 --> 00:15.998
around this island.

00:16.123 --> 00:19.167
Test us, and we will all burn.

00:19.474 --> 00:21.174
You've been warned.

00:21.682 --> 00:23.017
The only two people
who know you're still alive

00:23.142 --> 00:23.885
are the two you're looking at.

00:23.990 --> 00:24.746
And that's lucky for you.

00:24.848 --> 00:27.002
I know a couple of Navy SEALs
that would love to come say hi.

00:27.114 --> 00:28.082
Where's the fifth black op?

00:28.190 --> 00:28.794
There were four.

00:28.896 --> 00:30.445
No, you buried four,
but there were five.

00:30.547 --> 00:31.942
My lawyer Paul Wells,

00:32.057 --> 00:34.423
he's an old friend of Sam's,
and he's been amazing.

00:34.525 --> 00:36.652
But he's a government agent
sent to spy on me

00:36.773 --> 00:38.002
and turn me against Sam.

00:38.088 --> 00:39.611
Plug it into
the USB port of the car.

00:39.713 --> 00:41.696
Every time the driver makes
a call through the hands-free,

00:41.842 --> 00:43.788
you get the call on this.

00:43.885 --> 00:45.507
Why steal the firing
key? Why not reach out?

00:45.584 --> 00:46.477
Why not form an alliance?

00:46.575 --> 00:47.832
The word among sub captains
for a while

00:47.934 --> 00:49.564
has been that the CIA
has a sleeper agent

00:49.684 --> 00:50.758
on every nuclear sub,

00:50.848 --> 00:52.848
just in case some crazy captain
gets the wrong idea.

00:52.954 --> 00:54.729
Your sleeper will be
communicating with Langley

00:54.841 --> 00:56.292
by a secure radio channel,

00:56.442 --> 00:58.727
which means there's a comm site
somewhere on this island.

00:58.814 --> 00:59.660
We look for the comm site.

00:59.773 --> 01:01.708
We find the traitor,
we find the key.

01:03.014 --> 01:04.438
All right.
Listen up, people.

01:04.590 --> 01:05.233
In five days,

01:05.404 --> 01:06.698
a ship will be allowed
through the blockade

01:06.809 --> 01:08.760
to transport those of you
who have elected to leave

01:08.904 --> 01:10.063
back to the States.

01:10.255 --> 01:12.914
This ship will also be
delivering food and provisions

01:13.156 --> 01:14.025
a whole lot better

01:14.132 --> 01:15.788
than the beans and rice
we've had lately.

01:15.974 --> 01:17.056
Yeah!

01:17.163 --> 01:19.537
We've also negotiated
a 24-hour visit

01:19.736 --> 01:21.646
with your spouses
and family members.

01:23.210 --> 01:24.218
Yeah!

01:24.765 --> 01:26.094
I'll have more details shortly,

01:26.205 --> 01:27.961
but many of you are gonna
see your family again.

01:32.034 --> 01:33.445
Hey, Anders, I know
it's not going home,

01:33.567 --> 01:35.553
but at least you're gonna
get to see your wife.

01:36.949 --> 01:38.439
She's not gonna be
on that ship.

01:46.032 --> 01:47.107
So what do you think?

01:47.829 --> 01:50.154
I don't know. It seems
too good to be true, no?

01:50.337 --> 01:51.854
The government is spinning
every top on the table

01:51.966 --> 01:53.428
to buy some good PR.

01:53.725 --> 01:55.875
You know they're not gonna
let Christine come.

01:56.058 --> 01:57.809
No one for Grace or me either.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.262
Right. Well, they want
to drive a wedge

02:00.382 --> 02:02.095
between the officers
and enlisted, yeah?

02:02.196 --> 02:02.780
Yeah, sure.

02:02.886 --> 02:04.312
They cast us as the cause
of all their troubles,

02:04.415 --> 02:05.773
remind them what they're
missing at home.

02:05.877 --> 02:07.296
It's a smart move,
and they've got me in a bind.

02:07.399 --> 02:08.538
You say "yes," they look good.

02:08.661 --> 02:10.588
You say "no," you keep looking
like the crazy bastard

02:10.723 --> 02:12.031
who doesn't give a damn
about his crew.

02:12.142 --> 02:13.047
That's it.

02:13.164 --> 02:14.284
Hey, sir.

02:14.399 --> 02:15.933
We're still down a launch key.

02:16.078 --> 02:18.302
This thing goes sideways,
we're defenseless.

02:18.425 --> 02:20.295
Everyone who leaves this place
gets searched.

02:20.404 --> 02:21.724
We may not have
one of our keys,

02:21.826 --> 02:23.422
but I'm not gonna let someone
prove that to our enemies.

02:23.608 --> 02:24.250
Okay.

02:24.434 --> 02:26.439
How's it going with our friend
from the, uh, CIA?

02:26.534 --> 02:28.224
I'm the only face he's seen
for six days.

02:28.429 --> 02:29.900
And he likes to talk, so--

02:29.995 --> 02:32.111
Okay. Keep him talking.
See what you can find out.

02:40.103 --> 02:41.980
A hundred years ago,
we were self-sufficient.

02:42.092 --> 02:43.241
Our culture was pure.

02:43.354 --> 02:44.785
That's what seduced me
back to this island.

02:44.882 --> 02:46.020
There are enough provisions
on the ship

02:46.131 --> 02:47.314
to feed us all
for at least a month.

02:47.425 --> 02:48.724
A month? Tani.

02:48.839 --> 02:50.943
How much is a pound of flour
going for these days?

02:51.050 --> 02:53.554
Sorry, father. I'm not
letting you drag me into this.

02:53.663 --> 02:55.695
Do you need help
dealing with Serrat?

02:55.806 --> 02:57.281
Serrat leaves my people alone.

02:57.374 --> 02:58.684
The problem begins and ends

02:58.797 --> 03:00.293
with that blockade of ships
out there.

03:00.410 --> 03:01.783
I will do everything
in my power

03:02.004 --> 03:03.421
to fix this.

03:05.088 --> 03:06.924
You know you can't fix
what you are.

03:07.033 --> 03:08.623
And maybe your heart's
in the right place,

03:08.725 --> 03:10.198
but finally, you're no better
than the French

03:10.320 --> 03:11.804
when they took this island
and raided it

03:11.924 --> 03:13.343
for anything of value.

03:13.445 --> 03:14.677
That's true.

03:14.948 --> 03:16.671
We are who we are.

03:16.783 --> 03:18.832
And now we're here,
and that might not change.

03:18.929 --> 03:20.235
So...

03:20.915 --> 03:22.488
you might have to.

03:28.378 --> 03:30.081
This is hard for them, too.

03:30.193 --> 03:32.471
How long do you think you can
keep one foot in the water

03:32.735 --> 03:34.156
and the other on the shore?

03:36.175 --> 03:36.913
<i>Grasshopper.</i>

03:37.029 --> 03:39.507
- It's shortwave. It's very difficult
to locate. <i>- Earthquake.</i>

03:39.620 --> 03:40.969
- So I can tell you it's on the island...
<i>- One.</i>

03:41.066 --> 03:42.847

- No. Just tell me

about the signals. <i>- Six.</i>

04:19.242 --> 04:20.317
We have a holiday in our country

04:20.435 --> 04:23.261
that celebrates the coming
together of two cultures.

04:23.376 --> 04:26.290
Faced with great hardship,
these two very different groups

04:26.477 --> 04:28.830
formed what could only be called
a community

04:28.957 --> 04:30.581
as a means to survive.

04:30.900 --> 04:32.729
And as with many of
our traditions back home,

04:32.834 --> 04:34.616
we've already missed
our Thanksgiving.

04:34.772 --> 04:35.938
But tonight,

04:36.054 --> 04:37.711
in the spirit of that holiday,

04:37.912 --> 04:40.663
what's ours is yours.

04:40.764 --> 04:42.188
Hear, hear.

04:44.450 --> 04:47.077
So... what's good here?

04:48.034 --> 04:49.919
Pretty much the same
as yesterday.

04:50.027 --> 04:51.367
Some kind of noodle.

04:51.473 --> 04:53.233
Guess you can't really
go wrong with noodles.

04:53.348 --> 04:54.492
You don't have to do this.

04:54.646 --> 04:55.437
Do what?

04:55.552 --> 04:57.884
Chitchat.
Turn on the charm.

04:57.981 --> 04:59.088
Oh, that's what I was doing?

04:59.256 --> 05:00.345
"What's good here"?

05:00.444 --> 05:01.603
It's an honest question.

05:01.706 --> 05:03.101
Look, what happened
between us happened,

05:03.213 --> 05:04.729
and now we should just go back
to the way things were,

05:04.838 --> 05:07.428
with you being a jackass
and me trying to do my job.

05:07.647 --> 05:09.094
No need
for things to get weird.

05:09.208 --> 05:10.706
Right, 'cause this
isn't weird at all.

05:10.806 --> 05:12.407
Look, I thought you were with
the girl from the bar anyway.

05:12.504 --> 05:13.695
What's her name?

05:14.085 --> 05:15.032
Tani.

05:15.196 --> 05:16.102
Yeah.

05:16.234 --> 05:19.092
She's nice and she really
seems to like you.

05:19.571 --> 05:20.564
It's been known to happen.

05:22.147 --> 05:23.331
Captain.

05:23.438 --> 05:24.133
Mm.

05:24.906 --> 05:26.233
Sophie tracked the comm site.

05:26.344 --> 05:27.151
Looks like the sleeper's

05:27.263 --> 05:28.759
used it twice
in the last three days.

05:28.877 --> 05:30.028
That's one time too many.

05:30.411 --> 05:31.956
Whoever it is
must be feeling the heat.

05:32.088 --> 05:33.127
What's Booth offering?

05:33.311 --> 05:34.891
Nothing yet.

05:35.072 --> 05:36.494
- You trust him?
- Nope.

05:36.597 --> 05:38.421
- Good. Stay on him.
- Okay.

05:57.630 --> 05:59.404
Get hungry enough...

06:00.248 --> 06:03.135
even a Hoo-Ah bar
tastes like damn foie gras.

06:03.248 --> 06:04.517
You ever have foie gras?

06:06.384 --> 06:08.672
Like someone took
a prime filet and...

06:09.385 --> 06:11.345
turned it into butter.

06:12.778 --> 06:14.078
Ohh.

06:14.744 --> 06:16.006
Best foie gras I ever had

06:16.124 --> 06:17.905
was at this little bistro
in Macao.

06:18.579 --> 06:19.574
Mmm.

06:19.670 --> 06:22.514
The Chinese positively love
their French food.

06:23.931 --> 06:26.116
Damn, Kendal. I thought
we were past all this.

06:26.245 --> 06:27.164
Listen, Booth,

06:27.370 --> 06:29.517
that radio site, it's active.

06:29.722 --> 06:32.047
Whoever stole our launch key
is talking back to home.

06:32.157 --> 06:33.936
You want to guess what
the orders are gonna be?

06:34.611 --> 06:35.732
Don't much like guessing.

06:35.827 --> 06:37.754
One, they bomb us all to hell
and be done with it.

06:37.845 --> 06:39.030
Two, the sleeper gets desperate

06:39.140 --> 06:41.144
and me and Marcus each get
a bullet behind the ear.

06:41.753 --> 06:42.781
And you--

06:42.882 --> 06:44.708
you starve to death,
forgotten out here.

06:45.478 --> 06:46.823
Three--

06:47.128 --> 06:49.311
You trust me.
We work this thing together.

06:49.423 --> 06:51.043
You sit there
and you talk platitudes,

06:51.133 --> 06:52.599
you tell me I'm the man
for your job.

06:52.780 --> 06:54.446
You haven't given me
one single thing

06:54.553 --> 06:56.263
I can actually use, not one.

06:56.397 --> 06:57.587
And that's fine. I get it.
I get it.

06:57.694 --> 06:58.566
You want to be in control.

06:58.662 --> 06:59.755
You want to play
your hand tight.

06:59.844 --> 07:02.166
But right now, you've given me
no reason to trust you.

07:02.323 --> 07:03.753
You're still just a killer
waiting for the moment

07:03.858 --> 07:05.612
you talk me out of those cuffs.

07:05.732 --> 07:06.711
Hey.

07:06.800 --> 07:08.702
You gotta make me trust you,
Booth.

07:16.652 --> 07:17.948
Come on! Come on!

07:31.742 --> 07:33.326
Ahh!

07:42.026 --> 07:43.805
No. See, I haven't pulled
my cards yet. I'm gonna...

07:46.371 --> 07:48.545
So you didn't come up
last night.

07:48.963 --> 07:50.913
Where is he?
Get him!

07:53.021 --> 07:54.278
Can I help you gentlemen
with something?

07:54.378 --> 07:55.891
Wait. They're the law
on the island.

07:57.002 --> 07:57.975
What happened?

07:58.108 --> 07:59.010
That's him.

07:59.450 --> 08:01.249
- Whoa. No, no, I-- Oh, no!
- Wait, wait, no.

08:01.373 --> 08:02.245
Don't hurt him.

08:02.371 --> 08:03.573
Get off me! Get--

08:03.728 --> 08:06.017
Whose side are you on, <i>putaika?</i>

08:12.165 --> 08:13.887
I didn't do anything wrong!
Help!

08:14.014 --> 08:14.889
Help!

08:20.466 --> 08:21.665
Hey, lower your weapon
right now!

08:21.773 --> 08:22.700
Lower your weapon!

08:22.807 --> 08:23.878
Lower your weapon!

08:23.975 --> 08:25.457
Who wants to tell me
what's going on here?

08:25.559 --> 08:27.099
They're saying your man
took Erita

08:27.206 --> 08:28.716
into the jungle and raped her.

08:29.716 --> 08:30.755
Tell me that's not true.

08:30.874 --> 08:32.761
I didn't do it, captain!
I swear. She's lying.

08:32.857 --> 08:35.130
According to local laws,
he'll be punished by caning--

08:35.243 --> 08:36.061
a hundred cuts.

08:36.159 --> 08:38.162
If he survives, a brand
will be burned into his neck

08:38.301 --> 08:40.184
as a permanent mark
of the crime he committed.

08:40.288 --> 08:41.844
- A brand? - Oh, my God. You
can't let them do that to me.

08:42.010 --> 08:43.192
Cut him down. Now.

08:43.278 --> 08:44.426
This is not your affair,
Captain.

08:44.538 --> 08:45.455
This is an island matter.

08:45.563 --> 08:46.651
Cut him down!

08:47.116 --> 08:48.282
We have laws.

08:48.888 --> 08:49.976
This isn't right.

08:50.082 --> 08:50.960
Might is right.

08:51.062 --> 08:52.904
You may have your laws,
but I'll have my man.

09:10.115 --> 09:12.688
You don't believe a rapist
deserves to be punished?

09:13.028 --> 09:14.242
I do.

09:14.537 --> 09:17.041
But I don't accept that's what
he is, not without proof.

09:17.295 --> 09:18.330
I don't know this woman,

09:18.573 --> 09:19.905
and I haven't heard
her accusations.

09:20.009 --> 09:21.350
I have.
She speaks the truth.

09:21.444 --> 09:22.570
Well, that's an opinion,

09:22.677 --> 09:25.145
and for all I know, this is all
a concoction of Serrat's.

09:25.481 --> 09:27.391
We do not subject our people
to summary judgment

09:27.504 --> 09:29.186
and punishment
without due process.

09:29.294 --> 09:31.207
Our system has worked
for hundreds of years.

09:31.322 --> 09:33.528
It doesn't work for me.

09:33.686 --> 09:36.460
Hal Anders is a member
of the United States Navy.

09:36.658 --> 09:38.722
He'll have a trial
under my rules.

09:38.828 --> 09:40.229
You try that man
under your rules,

09:40.404 --> 09:42.418
no one on the island
will believe the verdict

09:42.542 --> 09:44.667
or believe you to be
less than a tyrant.

09:44.804 --> 09:46.815
That's a disappointment
I'll have to live with.

09:48.744 --> 09:50.713
We agreed on
a military-style trial.

09:50.828 --> 09:52.622
Seven member jury--
three from the Colorado,

09:52.746 --> 09:54.698
three from the island,
one neutral.

09:54.811 --> 09:56.421
It'll take five votes
to convict.

09:56.570 --> 09:57.288
I don't know, sir.

09:57.387 --> 09:58.624
I think he should be tried
on the Colorado

09:58.740 --> 10:00.404
by his own people, no?

10:00.552 --> 10:01.676
Once he stepped foot
off this boat,

10:01.769 --> 10:02.875
it got complicated.

10:02.981 --> 10:04.377
You know that. He knew that.

10:04.538 --> 10:07.337
This island needs to know that
we're not afraid of the truth.

10:07.442 --> 10:08.971
And if Anders is found guilty,

10:09.088 --> 10:10.789
we'll do the punishing.

10:11.154 --> 10:12.371
So who's the seventh juror?

10:12.494 --> 10:13.900
I already spoke to Sophie.

10:15.410 --> 10:16.887
Sir, you know Anders
is the only one left

10:17.006 --> 10:18.640
who's rated to work
the reactor, right?

10:18.754 --> 10:20.673
I'm aware
of how valuable he is.

10:21.182 --> 10:22.220
I did two tours in the nukes.

10:22.330 --> 10:23.310
I can hold it down for a while.

10:23.478 --> 10:24.806
And after that?

10:24.947 --> 10:25.989
You really want to be
stuck down there

10:26.094 --> 10:27.001
if something goes wrong?

10:27.161 --> 10:29.416
I want Anders not to have done
what the woman says he did.

10:29.532 --> 10:30.896
What if he did?

10:32.254 --> 10:34.335
Let's give him
the benefit of the doubt.

10:37.849 --> 10:39.546
How do you think Christine was?
She was pissed.

10:39.664 --> 10:41.133
Good.
The angrier she is at us,

10:41.253 --> 10:43.147
the more grateful she'll be
when you come through for her.

10:43.261 --> 10:44.682
Tell her you pulled
some strings.

10:44.918 --> 10:46.202
You're getting her
on that boat.

10:46.327 --> 10:47.530
Tell her she's getting
to see her husband.

10:47.627 --> 10:49.166
She'll trust you
with anything after that.

10:49.274 --> 10:51.115
God. They're setting him up
to be your white knight.

10:51.212 --> 10:53.164
Do they really think women
still fall for that?

10:53.270 --> 10:54.286
<i>I'll be right back.</i>

10:54.427 --> 10:55.563
- Sorry.
- What?

10:55.676 --> 10:58.633
Sam. Big Navy hero sweeps you
away from your drab little life.

10:58.744 --> 11:00.720
You can be a real stuck-up
bitch at times, can't you?

11:00.818 --> 11:02.651
I know. Genetics.
I'm working on it.

11:02.776 --> 11:04.244
Secretary Curry,
when she's on that ship,

11:04.351 --> 11:05.726
I need you to promise me
she'll be safe.

11:05.827 --> 11:08.070
Excuse me, Paul, but I'm not
gonna promise you anything.

11:08.170 --> 11:09.398
This isn't about
just one woman.

11:09.510 --> 11:10.986
It's about the future
of our country.

11:11.100 --> 11:12.820
I thought you believed that
as much as we do.

11:12.940 --> 11:14.780
I did.
I-I mean, I-I still do.

11:14.898 --> 11:16.335
Okay, now listen,
there's a woman--

11:16.440 --> 11:18.324
Kylie Sinclair--
name ring a bell?

11:18.430 --> 11:20.433
Yeah, daughter to the Sinclair
weapons fortune. Why?

11:20.545 --> 11:21.617
Christine hasn't mentioned her?

11:21.761 --> 11:23.692
Not yet.
Look, I gotta go.

11:23.872 --> 11:25.170
I'm here.

11:29.171 --> 11:30.460
And so he is.

11:30.840 --> 11:32.839
Wait, wait, wait.
Take this. Take this.

11:40.237 --> 11:41.900
Please tell me it's good news.

11:42.828 --> 11:44.482
Were you able to get me
on that boat?

11:45.350 --> 11:47.127
I couldn't get you cleared
for the trip.

11:47.299 --> 11:48.664
Sorry.

11:48.797 --> 11:49.653
Really?

11:49.766 --> 11:50.852
Went as far up the chain
as I could,

11:50.960 --> 11:52.256
but they shot it down.

11:52.373 --> 11:53.821
They just don't want you
on that ship.

11:53.922 --> 11:55.713
I wish there was something
I could do.

11:59.367 --> 12:00.369
Chief.

12:00.605 --> 12:01.862
Oh, Captain.

12:02.413 --> 12:03.299
You going somewhere?

12:03.488 --> 12:05.091
Uh, no.

12:05.166 --> 12:06.921
It's, uh, just busy work.

12:07.026 --> 12:08.382
Trying to keep my mind
off of the...

12:10.130 --> 12:11.514
I'm low on food and provisions.

12:11.647 --> 12:12.755
I'm low on crew.

12:13.715 --> 12:15.230
Tell me you didn't do this.

12:15.335 --> 12:16.645
Tell me the woman's lying,

12:17.228 --> 12:19.971
and I will do whatever is
necessary to protect you.

12:21.356 --> 12:23.980
You give me a Bible,
and I will swear on it.

12:24.440 --> 12:26.370
I did not do this, sir.

12:27.582 --> 12:28.956
Okay, chief.

12:31.719 --> 12:33.081
Same time tomorrow?

12:34.807 --> 12:36.627
Oh, sorry, Lieutenant.

12:37.122 --> 12:38.603
Come on in, Grace.

12:44.275 --> 12:46.514
You've heard about this,
uh, situation with Anders?

12:46.638 --> 12:47.300
Yes, sir.

12:47.454 --> 12:48.813
Okay, I want you
to handle his defense.

12:48.956 --> 12:50.931
I'm just not sure I'm
the right person for the job.

12:51.054 --> 12:53.103
Uh, well, you've put in time
on the honor committee

12:53.218 --> 12:53.944
at the academy,

12:54.051 --> 12:56.591
which is...
more than the rest of us.

12:56.689 --> 12:57.732
Understood, sir.

13:00.891 --> 13:03.098
You just give him
the best defense you can.

13:18.973 --> 13:20.442
- Surprise.
- Don't move!

13:20.572 --> 13:23.713
MRE spoon makes
a pretty good bump key.

13:24.039 --> 13:25.551
I could've been sipping tequila

13:25.719 --> 13:27.368
on a beach in Antigua
three days ago

13:27.475 --> 13:29.713
if that's what I'd wanted,
but it's not what I want.

13:32.315 --> 13:33.564
Trust me now?

13:34.755 --> 13:37.471
I know where the site is.
I can take you there.

13:37.597 --> 13:38.695
You know where the site is?

13:38.802 --> 13:39.815
I can put you on the horn
with people

13:39.915 --> 13:41.620
a lot more important
than the two of us.

13:41.742 --> 13:43.230
I'm gonna ask them
what I need to, Booth.

13:43.340 --> 13:46.566
You work with 'em, Sam, they'll
give you whatever you want.

13:47.687 --> 13:48.983
No more tricks.

14:00.214 --> 14:01.565
What's he doing here?

14:03.098 --> 14:04.274
Captain.

14:05.540 --> 14:07.583
I imagined your fingerprints
would be all over this.

14:07.717 --> 14:09.598
Just never thought
they'd be so visible.

14:10.126 --> 14:11.347
Whatever your quarrel,

14:11.942 --> 14:14.784
Erita has asked that Mr. Serrat
speak for the prosecution.

14:14.905 --> 14:16.615
Julian has always
been good to me.

14:17.043 --> 14:18.312
And he's not afraid of you.

14:18.438 --> 14:19.637
Are you quite sure of that?

14:19.753 --> 14:21.720
I wish only to see
justice served.

14:22.375 --> 14:23.181
Let's go inside.

14:23.282 --> 14:24.956
I've found that the open air

14:25.068 --> 14:27.309
is quite conducive to honesty.

14:27.992 --> 14:29.809
Do you not agree, Captain?

14:40.465 --> 14:42.707
Do you understand
why we're all here?

14:45.821 --> 14:47.735
I asked him to go for a walk.

14:48.791 --> 14:51.007
I just wanted to talk,
you know?

14:52.803 --> 14:54.871
It's true, we started kissing.

14:54.998 --> 14:56.314
But he started acting strange,

14:56.422 --> 14:58.237
telling me I should
cut my hair,

14:59.152 --> 15:01.570
that he liked women
with shorter hair,

15:02.126 --> 15:02.816
which was weird.

15:02.944 --> 15:04.548
Like he thought
he was my boyfriend.

15:04.920 --> 15:06.193
I-I mean,
you've seen her.

15:06.322 --> 15:09.428
She could've gone off
with anyone she wanted to.

15:09.837 --> 15:11.581
She chose me.

15:14.513 --> 15:15.689
Then we started kissing.

15:15.800 --> 15:17.245
He grabbed me,

15:17.423 --> 15:18.735
kissed me hard.

15:19.746 --> 15:20.882
I told him "no."

15:20.950 --> 15:22.518
I tried to run,
but he chased me.

15:23.798 --> 15:25.409
After he caught me...

15:26.006 --> 15:27.371
he held me down,

15:27.946 --> 15:29.993
started tearing at my clothes.

15:32.144 --> 15:34.433
I'm not denying
that we had sex.

15:34.539 --> 15:37.148
We did, and it was nice.

15:37.262 --> 15:38.944
I couldn't move.

15:40.412 --> 15:43.868
I just laid there
waiting for it to be over.

15:44.269 --> 15:46.406
When I started putting
my clothes back on,

15:46.528 --> 15:48.642
she said that I owed her
100 bucks.

15:48.753 --> 15:50.200
She didn't say anything
about that.

15:50.290 --> 15:51.041
Why would she?

15:51.179 --> 15:52.216
All she has to do

15:52.341 --> 15:55.315
is say the word "rape,"
and I become a monster.

15:55.433 --> 15:56.818
Now where's the justice
in that?

15:56.935 --> 15:58.168
I didn't ask for this.

16:04.969 --> 16:07.351
Now Libya--
that was hell.

16:07.611 --> 16:10.597
12 days
of soul-searching madness.

16:10.726 --> 16:12.579
I heard it was hard getting
Gadhafi on the throne,

16:12.707 --> 16:14.909
but you shoulda seen us
trying to get him off.

16:15.438 --> 16:17.309
How about you?
Any visible scars?

16:18.122 --> 16:20.123
No, North Koreans
don't like to leave marks.

16:20.226 --> 16:22.040
Yeah, at least
not on the outside.

16:22.166 --> 16:24.517
I've been thrown in the hole
in 16 different countries.

16:24.656 --> 16:27.259
Well, I guess 17 depending
what you call this place.

16:27.375 --> 16:28.789
You get caught a lot.

16:29.170 --> 16:30.703
You ever think about
a different line of work?

16:30.815 --> 16:32.782
Ah, the price
of doing business.

16:33.177 --> 16:36.004
Beatings I can take.
The body bounces back.

16:36.121 --> 16:38.134
But sensory dep-- blindfold,

16:38.408 --> 16:40.384
nose closed, ears plugged--

16:40.491 --> 16:41.545
Okay, okay,
you made your point.

16:41.635 --> 16:43.761
One-way ticket straight to
the inside of your head.

16:43.951 --> 16:45.701
Hard to go back to the wife
after that.

16:45.814 --> 16:46.707
What, you're married?

16:46.805 --> 16:48.489
Yeah, for a couple of years
back when.

16:48.587 --> 16:50.374
Irreconcilable differences.

16:50.724 --> 16:52.031
It wasn't her fault.

16:52.361 --> 16:53.997
She didn't know
what she signed up for.

16:54.309 --> 16:55.279
Know what I mean?

16:56.646 --> 16:58.505
Yeah.
You sure as hell do.

16:59.846 --> 17:01.584
The main pump is
reading more than 400 degrees.

17:01.683 --> 17:03.037
You're under attack
and need full power.

17:03.140 --> 17:04.271
Bring second pump online,

17:04.424 --> 17:06.353
flush for cold
while reducing power 80%.

17:06.446 --> 17:07.925
- Your captain needs full power.
- He can't have it.

17:08.050 --> 17:09.020
We melt down,
we're going nowhere.

17:09.122 --> 17:10.944
The auxiliary pump is reading
500-plus degrees.

17:11.069 --> 17:12.531
- Shut it down. Full stop.
- You're under attack.

17:12.655 --> 17:14.982
Not my problem. It's 40% over
redline. Gotta stop.

17:18.976 --> 17:20.954
You think I can really get
nuke rated this fast?

17:21.076 --> 17:22.428
Uh, nuke rated? No.

17:22.547 --> 17:24.819
But being able to keep us going
when we have to?

17:25.048 --> 17:26.602
That's the goal right now.

17:26.718 --> 17:28.204
Because if we lose Anders,

17:28.311 --> 17:30.431
every life in the sub
is gonna be in your hands.

17:30.534 --> 17:32.069
You can trust me, sir.

17:33.876 --> 17:34.934
Enter.

17:37.635 --> 17:39.216
Can I talk to you, sir?

17:39.868 --> 17:41.498
Hey.

17:41.606 --> 17:42.755
He's lying to them,

17:43.353 --> 17:45.201
telling them
that I don't want to go.

17:45.395 --> 17:46.969
You ready for it all
to start making sense?

17:47.066 --> 17:48.083
Mm-hmm.

17:48.249 --> 17:50.266
The life and times
of Paul Wells.

17:50.382 --> 17:52.856
So your Paul is one lonely guy.

17:52.965 --> 17:53.921
Grew up in the suburbs.

17:54.037 --> 17:56.257
After Annapolis,
went to Georgetown Law.

17:56.399 --> 17:57.841
Started working at a big firm,

17:57.955 --> 17:59.265
and then in 2007,

17:59.435 --> 18:01.412
gets a job
practicing family law.

18:01.542 --> 18:03.133
That's when he met her.

18:03.342 --> 18:04.654
She's gorgeous.

18:04.771 --> 18:05.658
She was his client.

18:05.759 --> 18:07.086
Came to him
for her second divorce,

18:07.209 --> 18:08.510
which should've been a clue,
but no.

18:08.669 --> 18:10.724
He got her a fat settlement
as a wedding present.

18:10.849 --> 18:12.827
A year later,
she gave him Daniel.

18:12.938 --> 18:15.118
Nine months after that,
she took Daniel away.

18:15.249 --> 18:15.993
No warning.

18:16.120 --> 18:18.416
Just takes the kid,
hops on a plane to Sao Paulo.

18:18.577 --> 18:19.757
He hasn't seen

18:19.883 --> 18:22.664
or spoken to his son
in two years.

18:22.767 --> 18:23.958
That's terrible.

18:24.084 --> 18:25.914
This is a man who falls
for the women he saves.

18:26.032 --> 18:27.187
Right now that's you.

18:27.317 --> 18:30.041
So that kiss the other night
probably lodged itself

18:30.196 --> 18:32.482
right in the middle
of his needy little heart,

18:32.630 --> 18:33.712
where it's growing--

18:33.818 --> 18:35.023
No.

18:35.157 --> 18:36.868
I'm not saying
you have to sleep with him--

18:36.983 --> 18:38.283
Good, because I'm not going to.

18:38.402 --> 18:41.768
I'm saying,
you have an opportunity.

18:41.879 --> 18:44.893
To exploit a heartbroken
father's loneliness?

18:45.036 --> 18:48.085
Every day this guy comes here
and makes a choice.

18:48.235 --> 18:50.396
Every day he chooses
to lie to you,

18:50.541 --> 18:51.646
to manipulate you,

18:51.772 --> 18:53.924
to try and destroy you
and your marriage.

18:54.066 --> 18:56.202
That's what this guy is.
Nothing more.

18:56.373 --> 18:57.676
Now we know what he wants.

18:57.810 --> 18:59.274
You.

19:00.303 --> 19:03.497
So what are you willing
to do about it?

19:16.108 --> 19:17.290
How far up is it?

19:17.410 --> 19:18.748
Another six klicks.

19:18.866 --> 19:20.592
But it's straight up.
The jeep's useless from here.

19:20.702 --> 19:23.521
Okay. Let's camp here.
Get an early start.

19:30.133 --> 19:33.413
Your, uh, your foie gras
rations for the day.

19:35.171 --> 19:36.869
So, um...

19:37.051 --> 19:38.881
how long
you been married, Kendal?

19:40.500 --> 19:42.421
You read my JSOC file.

19:42.946 --> 19:45.172
Just making
polite conversation.

19:46.752 --> 19:48.162
Okay.

19:49.003 --> 19:50.248
I've been married two years.

19:50.362 --> 19:52.356
You been at sea, what,
all but six weeks?

19:52.457 --> 19:53.139
That's right.

19:53.236 --> 19:54.828
Gonna be a while before
you get back now, huh?

19:55.479 --> 19:56.828
I'll get back.

19:57.022 --> 19:57.990
Mm.

19:58.702 --> 20:00.423
Always loved fire.

20:00.791 --> 20:02.475
That's purity right there.

20:03.096 --> 20:04.641
Beauty and death.

20:07.890 --> 20:10.123
They tied my hands
behind my back.

20:10.491 --> 20:12.565
He sat me down on a plank.

20:13.235 --> 20:14.495
Couple of bricks underneath.

20:14.610 --> 20:17.575
Who ever knew sitting on a board
could hurt so bad?

20:20.304 --> 20:22.201
After...

20:23.205 --> 20:25.244
I don't know how long it was...

20:26.399 --> 20:28.522
they came in,
they took the plank away

20:28.642 --> 20:30.392
and made me kneel
on the bricks.

20:30.501 --> 20:32.292
That when they put
the gun to your head?

20:38.624 --> 20:41.813
I'd get through it
thinking about my wife.

20:42.850 --> 20:45.675
The way her hair
hung down over her face

20:45.791 --> 20:47.752
when she was doing
the crossword.

20:48.319 --> 20:50.221
What gets you through
now, then?

20:50.720 --> 20:52.246
Same thing.

20:54.990 --> 20:56.718
My wife, she, uh...

20:58.785 --> 21:00.287
She has this...

21:02.775 --> 21:03.625
She answers "yes"

21:03.732 --> 21:05.941
before I finish
asking her for something.

21:07.888 --> 21:09.256
It makes her sound like
a bit of a pushover,

21:09.390 --> 21:10.162
but she's not.

21:10.301 --> 21:11.639
It's...

21:13.181 --> 21:14.506
It's trust.

21:15.583 --> 21:17.019
It's belief.

21:20.201 --> 21:21.423
I don't know.

21:21.522 --> 21:23.020
These women, man...

21:23.983 --> 21:26.020
make us doubt
everything we know.

21:26.981 --> 21:28.965
And then when
you least expect it...

21:29.066 --> 21:30.365
They get you through hell.

21:30.481 --> 21:32.117
Yes, they do.

21:32.461 --> 21:34.660
And tomorrow you get
a step closer to yours.

21:34.753 --> 21:36.391
You'll go home a hero.

21:36.819 --> 21:38.909
Probably throw you
a damn parade.

21:39.041 --> 21:40.523
Thought you guys
didn't have heroes.

21:40.627 --> 21:41.822
We don't.

21:41.931 --> 21:43.753
But we sure as hell
know how to make 'em.

21:44.642 --> 21:46.591
Every coup d'etat
needs a story.

21:46.702 --> 21:48.476
Every story needs a face.

21:48.575 --> 21:50.907
Marcus Chaplin
wasn't gonna be that mug.

21:51.358 --> 21:52.981
Believe me, Marcus doesn't
need a parade

21:53.078 --> 21:54.761
to tell him who he is.

21:56.021 --> 21:57.417
Not by a long shot.

21:57.558 --> 21:59.367
You still haven't made up
your mind, have you?

22:00.548 --> 22:03.414
What if I told you,
you're saving his life?

22:04.003 --> 22:05.634
Hey, Booth...

22:05.892 --> 22:07.305
if you wanted him dead,

22:08.062 --> 22:09.762
he'd be dead already.

22:09.881 --> 22:12.899
The agency has a bad history
with martyrs.

22:13.546 --> 22:15.385
We're downright terrified
of 'em.

22:17.407 --> 22:19.747
But we'll make 'em
if we have to.

22:25.845 --> 22:27.532
He never tried anything?

22:28.435 --> 22:30.340
Anders? Hell, no.

22:30.483 --> 22:31.716
He was one of the good guys.

22:31.838 --> 22:33.858
As opposed to the rest
of the frat boys on this boat.

22:33.983 --> 22:35.544
Somehow there's just
never enough space

22:35.660 --> 22:37.010
to get by them in a corridor.

22:37.377 --> 22:38.295
And the hands...

22:38.417 --> 22:39.500
Why don't you report it?

22:39.656 --> 22:40.631
Nah.

22:40.752 --> 22:42.057
You report it,
you become a problem.

22:42.182 --> 22:43.457
Best case, you get transferred.

22:43.578 --> 22:45.539
Worst case, you get transferred
someplace worse.

22:45.656 --> 22:47.108
But Anders-- he kept
his hands to himself?

22:47.247 --> 22:50.099
He's my department chief
at the reactor.

22:50.227 --> 22:51.261
He never tried a thing,

22:51.375 --> 22:52.992
but he's been different lately.

22:53.878 --> 22:54.680
Quiet.

22:54.793 --> 22:55.847
Probably 'cause of his wife.

22:55.974 --> 22:56.766
What happened with his wife?

22:56.904 --> 22:59.482
Got the "dear John" family-gram
ten days into the tour.

22:59.705 --> 23:00.860
She filed for divorce.

23:00.983 --> 23:02.515
She's pregnant, too.

23:03.681 --> 23:04.423
God.

23:04.553 --> 23:05.784
Yeah, stone cold.

23:05.925 --> 23:06.931
Couple days after it happened,

23:07.057 --> 23:08.027
I caught him looking at me.

23:08.131 --> 23:10.410
Not really sexual.
It was more...

23:10.556 --> 23:11.397
What?

23:11.515 --> 23:14.005
I don't know. Sad.

23:14.106 --> 23:15.119
Like every woman from now on

23:15.244 --> 23:16.788
is only gonna
make him think of her.

23:16.950 --> 23:18.676
Do you think
that he raped that girl?

23:20.121 --> 23:21.332
I don't know.

23:21.513 --> 23:22.975
She hangs around the bar,

23:23.168 --> 23:24.227
chatting up the guys.

23:24.344 --> 23:26.247
She works
at the buzzard's nest.

23:26.406 --> 23:28.386
Well, that's one way to put it.

23:28.504 --> 23:30.293
Hal's not the only one
she's been with.

23:30.414 --> 23:31.929
She was with me, too.

23:32.050 --> 23:33.399
And it wasn't for free.

23:33.507 --> 23:35.120
You gave her money for sex?

23:35.253 --> 23:36.930
No, not money.

23:37.168 --> 23:39.911
Food, magazines,

23:40.121 --> 23:41.134
you know...

23:41.246 --> 23:42.519
whatever's lying around.

23:43.394 --> 23:44.937
She was more than happy
to take it.

23:45.046 --> 23:46.248
When he came to me
with this information,

23:46.367 --> 23:47.666
I thought it was
important to share

23:47.822 --> 23:49.207
with both parties.

23:53.969 --> 23:55.732
Sir, Richmond
and Anders are friends.

23:55.852 --> 23:57.333
They came up through the--

23:57.913 --> 23:59.322
I thought you wanted
to get to the truth.

23:59.445 --> 24:01.244
Your job is to provide
an American serviceman

24:01.363 --> 24:02.856
with a vigorous defense.

24:03.300 --> 24:04.780
Just because she may have slept
with Richmond,

24:04.908 --> 24:06.647
just because she may have
accepted gifts afterwards,

24:06.780 --> 24:08.102
doesn't mean she wasn't raped.

24:08.229 --> 24:10.845
If it's relevant, use it.

24:11.379 --> 24:13.394
Sir, I know that Anders
is your bull nuke.

24:13.531 --> 24:15.008
So when it comes to keeping
the reactor online,

24:15.141 --> 24:17.180
he's your number one,
he's your only one.

24:17.789 --> 24:18.841
So I can understand
your desire--

24:18.964 --> 24:22.569
I do not like the implication,
Lieutenant.

24:23.243 --> 24:24.472
Sorry, sir.

24:25.410 --> 24:28.048
Just tell me this isn't gonna be
Navy justice as usual.

24:28.175 --> 24:29.135
Tell me we can do better.

24:29.265 --> 24:30.520
Be the best
at your job, Lieutenant,

24:30.665 --> 24:32.457
and the rest
will sort itself out.

24:33.018 --> 24:34.320
Yes, sir.

24:35.010 --> 24:36.267
They were gifts.

24:36.933 --> 24:38.644
I didn't ask for any of it.

24:39.548 --> 24:41.553
Well, he said they were
payment for sex.

24:41.680 --> 24:43.895
What is this? I'm the one
you're asking questions about?

24:45.177 --> 24:45.187
What about Hal Anders?

24:45.328 --> 24:46.542
I'm asking about him, too.

24:46.677 --> 24:47.507
Are you?

24:47.615 --> 24:49.642
Ask him if he
ran down any other girls...

24:50.143 --> 24:51.756
if he pushed anyone else
to the ground,

24:51.881 --> 24:54.466
tore off her clothes,
and held her down?

24:57.461 --> 24:59.827
Will you ask him if he'd ever
done any of that?

25:01.665 --> 25:03.470
Because that's what he did

25:04.299 --> 25:05.740
to me.

25:10.091 --> 25:11.326
Christine?

25:11.456 --> 25:12.777
Leave them off.

25:14.257 --> 25:15.906
You sounded strange
on the phone.

25:16.014 --> 25:17.341
Are you, uh...

25:18.034 --> 25:19.244
I have to see my husband.

25:19.364 --> 25:22.290
I told you, I've done
everything I can.

25:22.746 --> 25:23.725
I know you miss him,
but you--

25:23.851 --> 25:25.102
That's not it.

25:25.218 --> 25:26.218
I need to see Sam

25:26.349 --> 25:28.318
so I can tell him
that I'm leaving him.

25:28.489 --> 25:29.521
But I have to tell him in person.

25:29.664 --> 25:30.810
Otherwise
he'll never believe it.

25:30.908 --> 25:32.102
He'll just...

25:32.839 --> 25:35.051
He'll just think that it's
another government trick.

25:35.167 --> 25:36.702
I thought you loved him.

25:37.481 --> 25:39.248
I kissed you.

25:40.607 --> 25:41.477
That was, uh--

25:41.588 --> 25:44.628
I know what it was,
and so do you.

25:44.744 --> 25:46.668
And I don't like it
and I am not proud of it,

25:46.771 --> 25:48.047
but...

25:50.960 --> 25:52.552
But it was real.

25:53.334 --> 25:55.747
So I need to see my husband...

25:57.933 --> 26:00.115
so I can tell him
that it's over.

26:05.302 --> 26:06.707
Top of the world.

26:16.839 --> 26:19.583
You realize anything
in or out will be encrypted?

26:20.015 --> 26:22.036
Guess I'm just gonna
have to trust you then.

26:22.416 --> 26:23.618
Okay.

26:24.714 --> 26:25.733
Just so we're clear,

26:25.849 --> 26:28.864
you ask the question,
you're working for them.

26:30.038 --> 26:31.655
Who's the sleeper agent?

26:31.788 --> 26:34.507
Intel just for you or Chaplin?

26:38.215 --> 26:39.833
Guess I'll just
have to trust you.

26:39.965 --> 26:41.303
I guess so.

26:45.925 --> 26:46.925
All right.

26:47.161 --> 26:47.851
It'll take a minute

26:47.955 --> 26:51.101
for the backup singers
to transpose the lyric.

26:54.717 --> 26:56.305
You know, I met Gadhafi.

26:58.498 --> 27:00.698
He was one crazy mother
in the end.

27:01.148 --> 27:03.173
But before--
you'd never think it now--

27:03.290 --> 27:05.505
but he was humble.

27:05.617 --> 27:06.805
I'm sorry. Did you say
he was humble?

27:06.917 --> 27:07.675
Yeah, he was,

27:07.791 --> 27:09.412
like he'd been given
a sacred calling,

27:09.607 --> 27:12.138
and it was his burden
in life to answer.

27:12.251 --> 27:13.827
No, that's more delusional
than humble.

27:13.937 --> 27:15.835
Nah, wasn't like that at first.

27:16.131 --> 27:18.230
He really thought
he could change the world.

27:18.693 --> 27:19.852
Then the world changed him.

27:19.967 --> 27:21.175
The world changed him, huh?

27:21.279 --> 27:21.935
I don't know, Booth.

27:22.061 --> 27:23.607
Sounds like he was a nut job
right from the start.

27:23.721 --> 27:24.676
Nice to believe that.

27:24.806 --> 27:27.815
All the bad people in the world
are nothing like the rest of us.

27:27.941 --> 27:30.301
They got a defective gene.
Daddy didn't love 'em enough.

27:30.426 --> 27:31.304
But that ain't the case.

27:31.436 --> 27:32.769
Bad people
are just decent folks

27:32.888 --> 27:35.726
who've had a taste of power
and wanted more.

27:36.031 --> 27:37.763
Take your captain, for example.

27:39.136 --> 27:40.393
I know you don't want
to hear it, Sam,

27:40.517 --> 27:42.576
but Marcus Chaplin
is one spoonful away

27:42.704 --> 27:44.460
from going the way
of the Gadhafis of the world.

27:44.581 --> 27:46.493
I know what you're doing
and you can cut the crap, okay?

27:46.606 --> 27:47.959
You don't know the man.
Not even close.

27:48.068 --> 27:49.999
Are you kidding?
It's what we do, Sam.

27:50.486 --> 27:52.685
We go into countries,
we stir things up,

27:52.797 --> 27:53.905
then we pick someone.

27:54.044 --> 27:56.711
Someone from the military,
someone with leadership skills,

27:56.836 --> 27:58.625
and the righteousness

27:58.745 --> 28:01.188
to think they make up
the rules for everyone.

28:02.445 --> 28:04.403
Sound like anyone you know?

28:07.499 --> 28:09.231
<i>Baseball.</i>

28:09.514 --> 28:10.948
<i>Four. Six.</i>

28:11.069 --> 28:12.491
<i>Two. One.</i>

28:12.690 --> 28:13.962
<i>Airport.</i>

28:14.099 --> 28:17.193
<i>Six. Five. Three. Six.</i>

28:17.429 --> 28:19.767
Do me a-a favor.

28:20.121 --> 28:21.438
Say my name.

28:21.937 --> 28:23.682
- Come on, Booth.
- No.

28:23.808 --> 28:25.267
My real name.

28:25.817 --> 28:27.151
John Stosur.

28:27.252 --> 28:28.012
Why?

28:28.120 --> 28:29.276
Please, Sam.

28:29.909 --> 28:31.711
John Stosur.

28:33.269 --> 28:35.464
I haven't heard it out loud
in 20 years.

28:38.614 --> 28:40.222
I was wrong.

28:40.342 --> 28:42.765
They won't give up the sleeper.

28:43.090 --> 28:45.517
Asset's more important
to them than you.

28:52.965 --> 28:53.752
Aah!

30:08.232 --> 30:10.226
The Americans believe that
this is the first trial

30:10.351 --> 30:11.691
we've ever had on this island.

30:11.812 --> 30:12.771
No!

30:12.878 --> 30:14.342
But we've had many trials.

30:14.476 --> 30:15.380
- Yes!
- Many!

30:15.495 --> 30:18.502
Trials that began
when they first came here.

30:20.327 --> 30:22.529
We've had to share
our streets with them.

30:22.840 --> 30:24.158
We've had to watch
our children starve

30:24.268 --> 30:25.862
because they won't
allow in boats.

30:25.995 --> 30:27.263
Yes.

30:27.362 --> 30:29.932
We've had to spill our blood
because they won't leave.

30:30.044 --> 30:32.615
We've had to give up our
peaceful lives for their war.

30:32.766 --> 30:35.850
Can we really hope
to find justice here?

30:36.076 --> 30:37.522
No.

30:37.944 --> 30:38.861
Can we really believe
that this girl--

30:38.978 --> 30:41.353
our sister, our daughter,
our own--

30:41.453 --> 30:42.576
can expect to see the man

30:42.687 --> 30:45.533
responsible for her rape
punished for his crime?

30:45.690 --> 30:47.475
No.

30:47.948 --> 30:50.003
I don't believe
there is justice here.

30:50.567 --> 30:52.554
Maybe you will prove me wrong.

31:02.723 --> 31:04.527
We'll never know
what happened that night.

31:04.652 --> 31:08.062
We'll never know because
there is no evidence.

31:09.489 --> 31:10.659
No witnesses.

31:10.765 --> 31:11.927
No physical proof.

31:12.031 --> 31:14.802
No cuts or bruises
to indicate a struggle.

31:16.078 --> 31:17.243
And without evidence,

31:17.363 --> 31:19.762
it's just her story
against his.

31:21.839 --> 31:23.911
We do not take away freedom,

31:24.523 --> 31:27.323
we do not injure, lash,

31:27.467 --> 31:28.732
brand a man

31:28.847 --> 31:31.135
because of what
one person says.

31:31.920 --> 31:33.540
We're better than that.

31:34.414 --> 31:38.173
There is no evidence.

31:38.342 --> 31:40.049
Just a word a woman said.

31:40.172 --> 31:42.491
A word does not
make a man guilty.

32:22.599 --> 32:24.514
It happened at the academy.

32:24.857 --> 32:26.408
I had brought a cadet
before the committee

32:26.519 --> 32:28.152
for misconduct.

32:28.732 --> 32:30.534
It was one of his friends.

32:31.557 --> 32:33.650
He wanted revenge.

32:36.334 --> 32:37.935
He got it.

32:38.571 --> 32:40.252
Grace, I'm so sorry.

32:40.743 --> 32:43.285
I reported it
to the master chief.

32:44.705 --> 32:46.344
And he told me that...

32:47.247 --> 32:49.390
as an admiral's daughter,

32:49.893 --> 32:53.037
I should think about
how it would be perceived.

32:53.156 --> 32:55.721
That it would be
my story against his,

32:55.898 --> 32:59.185
and that no one could win
if I brought charges.

32:59.296 --> 33:00.848
So you dropped it?

33:01.177 --> 33:04.847
I had to see the man
who raped me...

33:06.173 --> 33:07.534
every day

33:08.502 --> 33:10.719
until I graduated.

33:15.028 --> 33:17.096
Erita was raped.

33:19.297 --> 33:20.264
When I talked to her,

33:20.445 --> 33:22.735
I could see
what she was going through.

33:23.446 --> 33:25.266
And that is something that...

33:25.536 --> 33:29.039
I have tried to never
think about again...

33:30.210 --> 33:32.638
to never feel again.

33:36.720 --> 33:38.971
But I recognized it.

33:40.927 --> 33:42.390
I knew it.

34:06.626 --> 34:07.977
What happened?

34:09.974 --> 34:11.414
Verdict's in.

34:13.746 --> 34:15.257
Not guilty.

34:36.940 --> 34:38.034
Get down!

34:40.016 --> 34:41.396
Come on.

34:52.998 --> 34:53.887
The EWS is secure,

34:54.027 --> 34:55.784
- but there's crew pinned down
in the bivouac. - Okay, radio back.

34:55.956 --> 34:57.569
I don't want any shots
fired into that crowd.

34:57.678 --> 34:58.635
Got it.

34:59.258 --> 35:00.238
Captain, uh,

35:00.351 --> 35:01.964
I think you should know
how the jury voted.

35:02.070 --> 35:03.908
Two of the crewmembers
and myself

35:04.017 --> 35:05.044
thought he was guilty.

35:05.180 --> 35:06.966
One of your crew
and all the islanders

35:07.088 --> 35:08.740
voted not guilty.

35:09.300 --> 35:10.528
I-I don't know why.

35:15.147 --> 35:17.459
Serrat rigged the jury
against himself.

35:18.963 --> 35:20.902
He wanted this to happen.

35:27.321 --> 35:28.684
Don't worry.

35:28.805 --> 35:30.871
No one's coming through
those doors. Not tonight.

35:33.869 --> 35:35.498
This was supposed to be
my last tour.

35:36.450 --> 35:37.986
I should be home right now.

35:38.510 --> 35:39.960
Hear you have
a baby on the way.

35:42.550 --> 35:43.999
No, she left me.

35:44.472 --> 35:47.121
Four months pregnant,
and she meets some other guy.

35:48.408 --> 35:49.703
If only I could've talked
to her,

35:49.809 --> 35:51.794
I could have made her
see things straight,

35:51.900 --> 35:53.263
but he...

35:53.563 --> 35:54.983
Ohh.

35:55.508 --> 35:56.954
No, she's gone.

35:58.249 --> 35:59.693
And now, uh...

35:59.797 --> 36:00.897
- Now what?
- Now this.

36:01.042 --> 36:02.214
These people burning up
their streets,

36:02.341 --> 36:03.411
screaming for my head.

36:03.497 --> 36:04.734
You just wanted to go home.

36:04.865 --> 36:07.262
That girl coming on to me
in front of everybody...

36:07.451 --> 36:08.733
And you kissed her
because you thought

36:08.854 --> 36:09.780
that's what she wanted.

36:09.900 --> 36:11.207
She did want it.

36:15.611 --> 36:16.585
Well, it's not your fault--

36:16.698 --> 36:18.145
I know it's not my fault.

36:18.261 --> 36:19.604
He won't let me go home.

36:19.725 --> 36:20.892
He won't let me see my wife.

36:20.999 --> 36:23.737
And by the time Erita told you
no, it was too late to stop.

36:23.856 --> 36:25.958
I would never do
something like that. Never.

36:26.108 --> 36:27.438
But you did.

36:27.789 --> 36:29.733
She told you to stop.

36:29.863 --> 36:31.398
She said it with a smirk.

36:32.701 --> 36:34.284
You raped her.

36:35.009 --> 36:36.668
This is the captain's fault!

36:36.789 --> 36:39.138
He won't let any of us
go home. Okay?

36:39.240 --> 36:41.262
This is his fault! Not--

36:57.160 --> 36:58.370
Secretary Curry,

36:58.490 --> 36:59.977
I finally got her
to come around.

37:00.090 --> 37:02.004
She said she'll only go
if I go with her.

37:02.121 --> 37:03.712
Making sure
he stays close to you.

37:03.828 --> 37:05.806
Fine. Listen, Paul,
I'm gonna need you

37:05.921 --> 37:07.260
to dig up a little something.

37:07.358 --> 37:09.501
Navy SEALs,
they wear helmet cams.

37:09.680 --> 37:11.532
The cams record
onto encrypted chips.

37:11.672 --> 37:13.307
Christine's new friend
Kylie Sinclair,

37:13.418 --> 37:15.489
she has access to tech
that can read them.

37:15.649 --> 37:17.295
Look, if this woman's
so dangerous to you,

37:17.428 --> 37:18.337
why don't you just--

37:18.439 --> 37:20.368
Yeah, just mention it
to Christine in passing.

37:20.488 --> 37:21.891
I want to know how she reacts.

37:30.058 --> 37:32.093
So you'll reach Sam,
tell him I'm coming?

37:32.276 --> 37:33.535
Yes.

37:33.839 --> 37:35.191
Just be careful.

37:36.603 --> 37:37.734
You, too.

37:45.044 --> 37:46.606
Um...

37:48.100 --> 37:50.915
I don't usually make
female friends.

37:51.115 --> 37:54.689
Honestly, I tend to think of
other women as the competition.

37:54.871 --> 37:57.553
You know, to be crushed.

37:59.723 --> 38:01.360
I'm just saying.

38:01.690 --> 38:03.371
Don't strain a muscle.

38:04.216 --> 38:06.165
I like you, too.

38:06.905 --> 38:08.282
Thank you.

38:30.141 --> 38:31.671
These old boards
are pretty moldy.

38:31.802 --> 38:33.729
You should probably
replace the whole floor.

38:36.444 --> 38:37.447
Just take me a day or two.

38:37.568 --> 38:39.145
You wouldn't have to
shut down for long.

38:43.649 --> 38:45.027
You can't keep
one foot in the water

38:45.163 --> 38:46.650
and one on the shore.

38:46.753 --> 38:48.001
What?

38:55.070 --> 38:56.646
Thank you.

38:56.775 --> 38:57.671
For what?

38:57.779 --> 39:00.121
Just... thank you.

39:12.901 --> 39:14.838
Just need to get
some more lumber.

39:15.868 --> 39:17.329
Okay.

39:37.172 --> 39:38.168
There's a window
to get to the sub.

39:38.291 --> 39:39.994
Let's not let it close.
Let's go!

39:45.338 --> 39:46.004
Sir?

39:46.130 --> 39:47.098
As captain of the Colorado,

39:47.209 --> 39:48.376
it's my obligation
to issue a discharge

39:48.557 --> 39:49.963
based upon immoral conduct.

39:50.206 --> 39:52.104
Senior Chief Petty Officer
Harold Anders,

39:52.223 --> 39:53.503
you're hereby relieved of duty

39:53.625 --> 39:55.232
and ordered to be
taken into custody.

39:55.347 --> 39:56.983
What the hell are you talking
about? They found me innocent.

39:57.101 --> 39:58.244
No, they found you not guilty.

39:58.374 --> 40:00.048
We both know
you're not innocent.

40:00.176 --> 40:01.788
You will be afforded
my protection on the submarine,

40:01.934 --> 40:03.893
but it won't be as a crewmember
or as a guest.

40:04.046 --> 40:06.559
It'll be in handcuffs
and confined to solitary

40:06.676 --> 40:09.086
till you can safely be handed
over to American authority.

40:09.213 --> 40:10.553
You sanctimonious
son of a bitch.

40:10.674 --> 40:11.887
I won't have an admitted rapist

40:12.019 --> 40:13.954
walk free on my boat
and mingle with my crew.

40:14.068 --> 40:15.513
You're not putting me in cuffs.

40:15.630 --> 40:17.601
That's the only way you're
stepping foot on my boat.

40:24.252 --> 40:25.880
Relief boat gets here in a day.

40:26.060 --> 40:27.367
You think I can't survive
until then?

40:27.470 --> 40:29.065
Hey, I won't calculate
those odds.

40:29.184 --> 40:30.914
But it's true, on this island,
you're an acquitted man.

40:31.025 --> 40:32.754
You're free
to make your own choices.

40:32.898 --> 40:34.228
You're just
gonna let him do this?

40:34.935 --> 40:38.077
If it were up to me, it'd be
a lot worse than handcuffs.

40:38.875 --> 40:40.617
Oh.

40:42.035 --> 40:43.521
I'll see you in hell, sir.

40:44.539 --> 40:45.808
In the jeep.

40:49.405 --> 40:50.634
Let's go.
