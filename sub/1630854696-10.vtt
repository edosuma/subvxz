00:00.894 --> 00:02.896
<i>The matter of
The State of Louisiana</i>

00:02.896 --> 00:06.483
<i>v. Eugene Jones
is called to order.</i>

00:06.483 --> 00:08.485
<i>All that matters now</i>

00:08.485 --> 00:10.820
<i>is that you walk out of here</i>

00:10.820 --> 00:12.489
<i>with your freedom.</i>

00:12.489 --> 00:14.407
<i>You say when
it comes to Desire,</i>

00:14.407 --> 00:16.534
<i>it's all in or all out.</i>

00:16.534 --> 00:19.871
<i>You haven't been all in
for a while.</i>

00:19.871 --> 00:22.082
<i>See, I may give up
Desire one day, but...</i>

00:22.082 --> 00:25.627
<i>ain't a motherfucker that's
gonna take that shit from me.</i>

00:25.627 --> 00:27.962
<i>Everything I got I fought for.</i>

00:27.962 --> 00:29.964
<i>I bled for.</i>

00:29.964 --> 00:33.343
<i>But I need you
to love all of me, too.</i>

00:38.431 --> 00:39.599
It was a gas leak?

00:39.599 --> 00:41.601
<i>It's got nothing to do with me.</i>

00:41.601 --> 00:43.728
<i>If you choose to do nothing now,</i>

00:43.728 --> 00:45.897
<i>what makes you so different?</i>

00:45.897 --> 00:47.607
<i>I have nowhere else to go.</i>

00:47.607 --> 00:50.151
<i>You may find that you do
belong someplace.</i>

00:50.151 --> 00:52.695
<i>Even if it's not the place
you've always been.</i>

00:52.695 --> 00:54.280
<i>Whatever you tell me,
it'll be okay.</i>

00:54.280 --> 00:55.949
<i>But if I find out
that you lied to me,</i>

00:55.949 --> 00:58.451
<i>you will never see me again.</i>

00:58.451 --> 01:00.203
<i>All right.</i>

01:00.203 --> 01:04.040
<i>Are you responsible for the
death of the Jones family?</i>

01:04.040 --> 01:06.292
<i>It was a gas leak.</i>

01:06.292 --> 01:08.461
<i>Okay. I should tell you</i>

01:08.461 --> 01:11.464
<i>I spoke with
an assistant U.S. attorney.</i>

01:11.464 --> 01:13.716
<i>So whatever it is you are doing</i>

01:13.716 --> 01:16.928
<i>with the Calabri family,
you need to stop.</i>

01:16.928 --> 01:20.473
<i>They are watching
everything you do.</i>

01:20.473 --> 01:22.308
We got a problem.

01:22.308 --> 01:24.352
<i>Jimmy Baxter just
called off the deal.</i>

01:24.352 --> 01:27.147
<i>The entire development
is being scrapped.</i>

01:27.147 --> 01:29.691
<i>The State moves to amend
the witness list.</i>

01:29.691 --> 01:31.818
<i>I would like to add a name.</i>

01:31.818 --> 01:33.945
<i>Michael Desiato.</i>

01:36.030 --> 01:37.448
<i>Lee?</i>

01:37.448 --> 01:39.534
<i>The prosecution wants
you to testify.</i>

01:39.534 --> 01:41.661
<i>What would you have me do?</i>

01:41.661 --> 01:43.538
<i>Lie.</i>

01:43.538 --> 01:45.206
<i>I can't do that.</i>

01:45.206 --> 01:49.169
<i>Don't be the one to send
Eugene away for life.</i>

01:49.169 --> 01:52.714
<i>Just keep me out
of that courtroom.</i>

02:17.572 --> 02:21.326
<i>I didn't know what to keep
and what to give away.</i>

02:21.326 --> 02:26.122
<i>Yeah. It must have been hard.
So, thank you.</i>

02:30.877 --> 02:32.212
<i>Oh, wow.</i>

02:32.212 --> 02:34.422
<i>Oh, my God.
These are amazing.</i>

02:34.422 --> 02:36.549
<i>Did Adam actually wear these?</i>

02:36.549 --> 02:39.886
<i>Yeah. Well, before
they were bronzed.</i>

02:41.346 --> 02:42.555
<i>Wow.</i>

02:45.058 --> 02:46.893
They're so tiny.

02:55.610 --> 02:56.736
<i>What's that?</i>

03:01.658 --> 03:03.660
Mariano Rivera?

03:03.660 --> 03:05.745
<i>He was a relief pitcher
for the Yankees.</i>

03:05.745 --> 03:09.415
<i>He was Adam's favorite player.</i>

03:09.415 --> 03:12.085
<i>He was the greatest
closer of all time.</i>

03:13.962 --> 03:15.755
<i>Rocco.</i>

03:15.755 --> 03:17.966
<i>Rocco, look.</i>

03:30.979 --> 03:32.772
State has one more witness.

03:32.772 --> 03:34.107
What does it even matter?

03:34.107 --> 03:36.442
<i>Everybody says they saw me.</i>

03:36.442 --> 03:38.987
<i>What the prosecution
has put forth</i>

03:38.987 --> 03:42.615
<i>are eight people who were at a
party celebrating Carlo Baxter</i>

03:42.615 --> 03:44.617
<i>getting away with murder.</i>

03:44.617 --> 03:47.829
<i>Eight cross-racial
identifications.</i>

03:47.829 --> 03:49.455
<i>None of the eight people</i>

03:49.455 --> 03:52.625
<i>actually claim to have seen
the gun being shot.</i>

03:52.625 --> 03:54.460
<i>And what about these?</i>

03:57.505 --> 04:01.342
<i>Concede nothing to these
people. You hear me?</i>

04:01.342 --> 04:05.722
<i>All we need is one juror,
one person to care enough,</i>

04:05.722 --> 04:08.433
<i>to sympathize with what
you've been through,</i>

04:08.433 --> 04:12.145
<i>and regardless of what may
or may not have happened,</i>

04:12.145 --> 04:15.273
<i>to understand that you
do not belong in prison.</i>

04:15.273 --> 04:18.985
<i>You just need to convince
one person.</i>

04:24.324 --> 04:25.491
<i>Eighteen months of work</i>

04:25.491 --> 04:26.784
<i>and Jimmy Baxter just decides</i>

04:26.784 --> 04:28.328
<i>to pull the plug
at the final hour?</i>

04:28.328 --> 04:29.579
<i>What the fuck?</i>

04:29.579 --> 04:32.165
<i>It's not you.</i>

04:32.165 --> 04:33.958
<i>It's not. There's something
about this city.</i>

04:33.958 --> 04:37.337
<i>It's designed to ensure
its problems never get solved.</i>

04:37.337 --> 04:39.255
<i>But we can't stop trying.</i>

04:39.255 --> 04:41.632
<i>Oh, I don't want to stop trying.</i>

04:41.632 --> 04:43.885
<i>The question is: Will they
give me another shot?</i>

04:44.594 --> 04:48.056
<i>I mean, they transferred me once
before, they could do it again.</i>

04:48.056 --> 04:50.850
<i>Yes, they can, Nancy.</i>

04:50.850 --> 04:53.186
<i>First, it was New York
to New Orleans.</i>

04:53.186 --> 04:55.480
<i>Now it'll probably
be New Orleans to...</i>

04:55.480 --> 04:57.106
<i>fucking New Hampshire.</i>

04:57.106 --> 05:00.902
<i>I'll be prosecuting
bootleggers of maple syrup.</i>

05:04.947 --> 05:08.743
<i>Well, those syrup bootleggers
better beware.</i>

05:11.037 --> 05:14.957
<i>Look, it doesn't matter
if it's Jimmy Baxter or...</i>

05:14.957 --> 05:17.210
<i>Mayor Figaro.</i>

05:17.210 --> 05:19.128
<i>In the history of men,</i>

05:19.128 --> 05:22.799
<i>getting away with shit always
emboldens them to do it again.</i>

05:23.758 --> 05:26.052
<i>And we'll be there.</i>

05:26.052 --> 05:28.388
<i>Definitely.</i>

05:29.597 --> 05:33.059
<i>I talked to Sal Calabri
this morning.</i>

05:33.059 --> 05:36.229
<i>He is not pleased with
that husband of yours.</i>

05:36.229 --> 05:38.231
<i>I know the feeling.</i>

05:38.231 --> 05:42.151
<i>Now, if Jimmy doesn't want
to run the family,</i>

05:42.151 --> 05:45.405
<i>it might be time
we take it from him.</i>

05:45.405 --> 05:48.408
<i>I completely agree.</i>

05:48.408 --> 05:50.910
<i>Maybe I stay here
a little while longer</i>

05:50.910 --> 05:53.371
<i>and help right the ship.</i>

05:53.371 --> 05:54.539
<i>Until when?</i>

05:54.539 --> 05:56.165
<i>Until Carlo is ready.</i>

05:56.165 --> 05:58.167
<i>Papa, I am ready.</i>

05:58.167 --> 06:02.171
<i>Please, let's not have
that conversation. Okay?</i>

06:02.171 --> 06:05.383
<i>If I were your son, I would
be the head of this family.</i>

06:05.383 --> 06:08.177
<i>And you know I would've done
a better job than Jimmy's done.</i>

06:08.177 --> 06:12.223
<i>Listen, this might seem
antiquated to you,</i>

06:12.223 --> 06:14.892
<i>but it's just not the way things</i>

06:14.892 --> 06:19.856
<i>are done in our business.</i>

06:19.856 --> 06:22.275
<i>I thought we make the rules?</i>

06:22.275 --> 06:24.777
<i>Not this one.</i>

06:32.910 --> 06:35.121
<i>They'd like a word.</i>

07:06.736 --> 07:09.113
<i>Hotel living don't
suit you, Jimmy.</i>

07:10.740 --> 07:12.950
<i>Though, as far as dog houses
are concerned,</i>

07:12.950 --> 07:15.161
<i>I guess it could be worse.</i>

07:19.332 --> 07:22.376
<i>Take a mighty shiny piece
of jewelry to mend fences</i>

07:22.376 --> 07:23.878
<i>with the missus, huh?</i>

07:23.878 --> 07:26.589
<i>What do you want?</i>

07:26.589 --> 07:28.716
French Quarter.

07:30.384 --> 07:32.094
<i>You control the streets,</i>

07:32.094 --> 07:34.472
<i>the police, all of that.</i>

07:34.472 --> 07:36.933
<i>I want Desire
to have free reign.</i>

07:38.392 --> 07:41.354
<i>I have no interest
in the drug business.</i>

07:42.688 --> 07:46.776
<i>And the drug business
ain't got no interest in you.</i>

07:46.776 --> 07:48.778
<i>I just want your blessing</i>

07:48.778 --> 07:51.614
<i>to expand my operation
in the neighborhood.</i>

07:53.241 --> 07:56.369
<i>Now, why would I agree to that?</i>

07:57.578 --> 07:59.872
<i>Because I'll sell you the club.</i>

08:01.415 --> 08:03.584
<i>And that, as far as
your wife is concerned,</i>

08:03.584 --> 08:07.171
<i>is shinier than
the Hope Diamond.</i>

08:07.171 --> 08:11.342
<i>Nothing Gina hate more than look
across that street and see me.</i>

08:11.342 --> 08:13.844
<i>Think of how happy
she'd be if...</i>

08:13.844 --> 08:16.055
<i>you gave it to her.</i>

08:20.393 --> 08:23.854
<i>Your offer is rejected.</i>

08:53.801 --> 08:55.720
<i>quiet, ominous music</i>

09:09.609 --> 09:12.278


09:22.079 --> 09:24.957
<i>Judge.
-</i>

09:28.336 --> 09:29.587
<i>You've been served.</i>

09:29.587 --> 09:31.881
It's okay, it's okay.

09:31.881 --> 09:33.215
<i>It's okay.</i>

09:41.223 --> 09:43.309


09:57.448 --> 10:00.660
<i>I've... been subpoenaed.</i>

10:03.704 --> 10:05.873
<i>I know you don't want to.</i>

10:07.375 --> 10:09.835
<i>He wasn't trying to kill Adam.</i>

10:10.419 --> 10:13.673
<i>Not your job
to protect that boy.</i>

10:13.673 --> 10:17.009
<i>And no one thinks you're trying
to ruin his life, but he...</i>

10:17.009 --> 10:20.388
<i>He did leave that baby
without a father.</i>

10:27.561 --> 10:29.647
<i>This is not on you.</i>

10:32.024 --> 10:33.901
<i>You're a good man, Michael.</i>

10:41.075 --> 10:44.036
<i>haunting, moody music</i>

11:00.594 --> 11:02.555
<i>quiet, somber music</i>

11:10.563 --> 11:12.898


11:12.898 --> 11:14.233
<i>Yeah.</i>

11:14.233 --> 11:15.735
<i>Fia's gonna wait
for the babysitter.</i>

11:15.735 --> 11:18.070
<i>She said we should go ahead.</i>

11:20.448 --> 11:22.241
<i>Ready?</i>

11:23.993 --> 11:25.494
<i>Yeah.</i>

11:33.961 --> 11:35.713
<i>Hey.</i>

11:39.675 --> 11:41.385
<i>I love you.</i>

11:45.097 --> 11:47.224
<i>I spent the weekend reviewing
your briefs</i>

11:47.224 --> 11:48.642
<i>regarding the witness.</i>

11:48.642 --> 11:50.728
<i>The scope of his testimony
is to be confined</i>

11:50.728 --> 11:51.979
<i>to the night of the shooting.</i>

11:51.979 --> 11:53.564
<i>He knows far more
about this case</i>

11:53.564 --> 11:56.442
<i>than simply the events
on the night in question.</i>

11:56.442 --> 11:58.569
<i>If you're gonna allow
a convicted felon</i>

11:58.569 --> 12:00.863
<i>to testify as
a last-minute addition,</i>

12:00.863 --> 12:03.449
<i>I'm entitled to explore
the circumstances</i>

12:03.449 --> 12:05.451
<i>surrounding that event,
which are absolutely pertinent</i>

12:05.451 --> 12:07.244
<i>to my client's defense.</i>

12:07.244 --> 12:10.456
<i>I didn't hold this conference
to listen to you repeat</i>

12:10.456 --> 12:12.458
<i>the arguments you made
in your brief.</i>

12:12.458 --> 12:15.878
<i>The allegations you make against
Michael Desiato are damning.</i>

12:15.878 --> 12:17.630
<i>They're also unfounded.</i>

12:17.630 --> 12:20.925
<i>You will not be lodging them
in my courtroom.</i>

12:20.925 --> 12:23.052
<i>My ruling on the scope is final.</i>

12:23.052 --> 12:25.471
<i>And Ms. Delamere,
if you overstep,</i>

12:25.471 --> 12:28.766
<i>I will have no hesitation
about holding you in contempt</i>

12:28.766 --> 12:31.393
<i>and ordering a new trial
for Mr. Jones.</i>

12:35.481 --> 12:37.942
<i>haunting music</i>

12:44.198 --> 12:45.991
<i>If you can't lie,</i>

12:45.991 --> 12:48.661
<i>the least you could do
is plead the Fifth.</i>

12:48.661 --> 12:51.705
<i>That's what any lawyer would
advise you to do anyway.</i>

13:00.548 --> 13:01.507
The State calls

13:01.507 --> 13:03.884
<i>Michael Desiato.</i>

13:27.491 --> 13:29.326
<i>Do you swear and affirm
that the testimony</i>

13:29.326 --> 13:30.870
<i>you're about to provide
is the truth,</i>

13:30.870 --> 13:33.873
<i>the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?</i>

13:33.873 --> 13:35.541
<i>I do.</i>

13:54.059 --> 13:56.896
<i>Judge Desiato, were you--
- Objection.</i>

13:58.147 --> 13:59.899
<i>The witness is not a judge.</i>

13:59.899 --> 14:01.609
<i>It is a sign of respect</i>

14:01.609 --> 14:03.569
<i>for a previous position
that he held.</i>

14:03.569 --> 14:06.280
<i>One that was taken from him.</i>

14:06.280 --> 14:07.781
<i>Approach.</i>

14:10.200 --> 14:13.078
<i>We can't get past
the witness's name</i>

14:13.078 --> 14:15.331
<i>without this going
off the rails?</i>

14:15.331 --> 14:18.834
<i>If I'm not permitted
to examine this witness</i>

14:18.834 --> 14:21.545
<i>in a way that impugns
his integrity,</i>

14:21.545 --> 14:23.505
<i>surely you won't allow the State</i>

14:23.505 --> 14:24.590
<i>to afford him
a deferential title</i>

14:24.590 --> 14:27.593
<i>that he no longer deserves.</i>

14:27.593 --> 14:29.428
<i>Get on with it.</i>

14:33.641 --> 14:35.559
<i>Mr. Desiato...</i>

14:35.559 --> 14:38.103
<i>were you at the Baxter House
hotel the night of the shooting?</i>

14:38.103 --> 14:39.438
<i>Yes.</i>

14:39.438 --> 14:40.940
<i>What were you doing there?</i>

14:40.940 --> 14:43.150
<i>I was looking for my son Adam.</i>

14:43.150 --> 14:45.235
And why was Adam there?

14:45.235 --> 14:47.446
He was dating Fia Baxter.

14:47.446 --> 14:50.282
How long had they been dating?

14:50.282 --> 14:52.451
Uh, I'm not sure.

14:52.451 --> 14:54.078
<i>A few months.</i>

14:54.078 --> 14:56.580
<i>When did you learn
of their relationship?</i>

14:56.580 --> 14:57.998
That day.

14:57.998 --> 15:01.752
<i>So, you went to get Adam,</i>

15:01.752 --> 15:03.963
<i>and then what happened next?</i>

15:04.964 --> 15:06.840
<i>There was a party at the hotel.</i>

15:06.840 --> 15:09.760
<i>I-I wasn't on the guest list,</i>

15:09.760 --> 15:12.763
<i>so security wasn't
letting me in.</i>

15:12.763 --> 15:15.766
<i>I went around the side,</i>

15:15.766 --> 15:21.063
<i>to a window, so I could look
in at the bar and restaurant.</i>

15:21.063 --> 15:22.731
<i>And did you see Adam?</i>

15:22.731 --> 15:23.941
<i>Yes.</i>

15:23.941 --> 15:25.651
<i>Did you see anyone else?</i>

15:30.948 --> 15:32.658
<i>Mr. Desiato.</i>

15:32.658 --> 15:35.619
<i>Did you see anyone else
through the window?</i>

15:35.619 --> 15:38.497
<i>Yes, I saw Adam and Fia.</i>

15:38.497 --> 15:40.332
<i>The Baxter family.</i>

15:40.332 --> 15:44.670
<i>It-it was a party, so there
were a lot of people.</i>

15:47.464 --> 15:49.883
<i>And I'm sorry
to have to ask, but...</i>

15:52.553 --> 15:54.430
<i>...did you see your son
get shot?</i>

15:58.308 --> 16:02.021
<i>I was trying to get
his attention.</i>

16:03.731 --> 16:05.816
<i>And then...</i>

16:05.816 --> 16:07.776
<i>Suddenly, there...</i>

16:07.776 --> 16:10.863
<i>There was a... bang.</i>

16:12.531 --> 16:15.492
<i>The bullet hit Adam in the neck.</i>

16:17.161 --> 16:21.165
<i>I looked past him
and I saw someone...</i>

16:21.165 --> 16:24.001
<i>standing next to
the kitchen in the back.</i>

16:24.001 --> 16:26.003
<i>And he...</i>

16:26.003 --> 16:29.298
<i>He was holding a gun
in his hand.</i>

16:31.717 --> 16:35.054
<i>Adam fell to the floor.</i>

16:35.054 --> 16:39.641
<i>I ran inside
and I-I yelled for help.</i>

16:42.561 --> 16:46.940
<i>I held my son
in my arms as he died.</i>

16:50.360 --> 16:52.738
And did you see who shot him?

16:54.406 --> 16:56.492
<i>Yes.</i>

16:56.492 --> 16:59.453
<i>And was it
the defendant Eugene Jones?</i>

16:59.453 --> 17:01.455
<i>quiet, tense music</i>

17:05.334 --> 17:07.419
<i>Yes, it was.</i>

17:24.478 --> 17:28.107
<i>Mr. Desiato, do you
believe in justice?</i>

17:29.483 --> 17:33.362
<i>We've already established
that you were a judge.</i>

17:33.362 --> 17:35.030
<i>Do you need me to define
justice for you?</i>

17:35.030 --> 17:36.865
<i>Objection, badgering.</i>

17:36.865 --> 17:38.242
<i>Sustained.</i>

17:38.242 --> 17:40.869
<i>Allow the witness to answer.</i>

17:40.869 --> 17:43.205
Do you believe in justice?

17:44.665 --> 17:45.791
<i>I don't know.</i>

17:45.791 --> 17:48.127
<i>How about karma?</i>

17:48.127 --> 17:51.630
<i>How about payback,
comeuppance, retribution?</i>

17:51.630 --> 17:53.632
<i>Is counsel serious
with these questions?</i>

17:53.632 --> 17:56.135
<i>Fine. How about this one:</i>

17:56.135 --> 17:58.137
<i>Do you believe your son
deserved to die?</i>

17:58.137 --> 17:59.304
<i>Counsel.</i>

18:03.934 --> 18:05.978
If this is how it's gonna go,

18:05.978 --> 18:09.606
<i>I'll end your cross
right now, Ms. Delamere.</i>

18:14.236 --> 18:18.323
<i>Mr. Desiato, do you know
of any reason why my client</i>

18:18.323 --> 18:20.159
<i>would've wanted
to kill your son?</i>

18:22.953 --> 18:24.454
<i>No, I don't.</i>

18:24.454 --> 18:26.498
<i>Do you know of any reason
why my client</i>

18:26.498 --> 18:28.000
<i>would have wanted
to kill Carlo Baxter?</i>

18:28.000 --> 18:29.209
<i>Objection!</i>

18:29.209 --> 18:31.295
Approach, now.

18:35.382 --> 18:37.509
<i>Your Honor, the State
has already alleged</i>

18:37.509 --> 18:39.094
<i>revenge as a motive.</i>

18:39.094 --> 18:41.972
<i>Which stems directly
from Mr. Baxter's trial</i>

18:41.972 --> 18:43.432
<i>in the witness's courtroom.</i>

18:43.432 --> 18:45.684
<i>And you are free to explore
that area...</i>

18:45.684 --> 18:48.020
<i>but not with this witness.</i>

18:48.020 --> 18:51.690
<i>That trial, as far as
Mr. Desiato is concerned,</i>

18:51.690 --> 18:54.526
<i>is out of bounds.</i>

19:13.795 --> 19:17.633
<i>Mr. Desiato, can you describe
your vantage point</i>

19:17.633 --> 19:19.301
<i>when Adam was shot?</i>

19:19.301 --> 19:22.387
<i>I was looking through a window.</i>

19:22.387 --> 19:24.514
<i>Big window, small window?</i>

19:24.514 --> 19:25.933
<i>Big.</i>

19:25.933 --> 19:27.809
<i>Any obstructions?</i>

19:27.809 --> 19:29.770
<i>Blinds, curtains?</i>

19:29.770 --> 19:31.813
<i>There were curtains,
but they were open.</i>

19:31.813 --> 19:33.357
How wide?

19:33.357 --> 19:35.734
<i>Wide enough
to see inside clearly.</i>

19:35.734 --> 19:38.570
<i>Inside, how many
people were there?</i>

19:39.780 --> 19:41.740
<i>Twenty, thirty at least.</i>

19:41.740 --> 19:45.035
<i>Were you able
to see Adam right away?</i>

19:45.035 --> 19:47.079
<i>No, I-I was...</i>

19:47.079 --> 19:50.332
<i>scanning the room
until I spotted him.</i>

19:50.332 --> 19:52.876
<i>And the shooter...</i>

19:52.876 --> 19:55.504
<i>did you see him before he fired?</i>

19:55.504 --> 19:57.214
No, after.

19:57.214 --> 19:59.049
<i>Did he run?</i>

19:59.049 --> 20:00.592
Yes.

20:00.592 --> 20:03.178
<i>How long were you able
to see him for?</i>

20:04.471 --> 20:06.431
<i>A couple seconds.</i>

20:08.475 --> 20:11.728
<i>So you're looking
through a window,</i>

20:11.728 --> 20:14.106
<i>past curtains, into a dark room</i>

20:14.106 --> 20:15.774
<i>with a lot of people,</i>

20:15.774 --> 20:19.069
<i>and you were focused
on your son.</i>

20:20.988 --> 20:22.572
<i>Are you certain,</i>

20:22.572 --> 20:24.616
<i>that past all of that,</i>

20:24.616 --> 20:27.619
<i>that it was Eugene Jones
you saw holding the gun?</i>

20:29.121 --> 20:30.455
<i>Yes.</i>

20:30.455 --> 20:32.291
You saw his face?

20:32.291 --> 20:33.625
I did.

20:33.625 --> 20:34.793
Did you see what he was wearing?

20:34.793 --> 20:37.296
<i>Jeans and a white T-shirt</i>

20:37.296 --> 20:41.466
<i>and a checkered hoodie, unzipped.</i>

20:41.466 --> 20:43.302
<i>You only had a couple seconds</i>

20:43.302 --> 20:45.804
<i>and you claim
to have seen his face,</i>

20:45.804 --> 20:47.973
<i>his pants, his shirt?</i>

20:47.973 --> 20:50.142
<i>No, that... that is what
he was wearing.</i>

20:50.142 --> 20:52.477
<i>I-I didn't ask you
what he was wearing.</i>

20:52.477 --> 20:56.565
<i>I'm asking how
can you remember that?</i>

20:56.565 --> 20:58.984
<i>How can you confidently
identify a boy</i>

20:58.984 --> 21:01.403
<i>who you have never seen before?</i>

21:04.448 --> 21:06.408
<i>You wanted to tell the truth.</i>

21:06.408 --> 21:08.160
<i>Objection. Argumentative.</i>

21:08.160 --> 21:09.828
Sustained.

21:14.875 --> 21:16.835
<i>He was wearing the same clothes</i>

21:16.835 --> 21:18.962
<i>that I had seen him in
earlier that day.</i>

21:18.962 --> 21:21.673
<i>Objection! Beyond the scope!
Move to strike.</i>

21:21.673 --> 21:24.134
<i>The witness opened
the door, Your Honor.</i>

21:25.260 --> 21:26.803
Yes, he did.

21:26.803 --> 21:29.848
<i>You may proceed, carefully.</i>

21:29.848 --> 21:33.518
<i>When did you see Eugene
Jones earlier that day?</i>

21:33.518 --> 21:35.479
<i>I saw him in my chambers.</i>

21:35.479 --> 21:38.023
<i>He was selling me a baseball.</i>

21:38.023 --> 21:39.691
<i>Objection! The witness
is offering</i>

21:39.691 --> 21:41.026
<i>narrative not asked for.</i>

21:41.026 --> 21:43.070
<i>Sustained.
- Fine.</i>

21:43.070 --> 21:45.030
<i>Why was he in your chambers?</i>

21:46.031 --> 21:48.575
<i>He was selling me a baseball.</i>

21:48.575 --> 21:50.535
How much for?

21:50.535 --> 21:51.828
$500.

21:51.828 --> 21:54.414
<i>Why so expensive?</i>

21:54.414 --> 21:57.709
<i>It was autographed
by Mariano Rivera.</i>

21:59.086 --> 22:01.588
<i>What was your interest
in that ball?</i>

22:03.715 --> 22:05.842
<i>It once belonged to my son.</i>

22:05.842 --> 22:08.387
<i>Do you know how Adam's baseball</i>

22:08.387 --> 22:11.390
<i>came into the possession
of Eugene Jones?</i>

22:11.390 --> 22:12.891
He inherited it,

22:12.891 --> 22:15.852
<i>from his brother Kofi Jones</i>

22:15.852 --> 22:17.979
<i>after he died.</i>

22:19.940 --> 22:23.777
<i>How did Kofi Jones end up
with that baseball?</i>

22:29.991 --> 22:33.036
<i>It was in my car.</i>

22:33.036 --> 22:35.747
The car that hit Rocco Baxter?

22:35.747 --> 22:37.374
Yes.

22:37.374 --> 22:40.252
The car that Kofi stole?

22:40.252 --> 22:42.087
Yes.

22:42.087 --> 22:45.382
<i>The car that he stole
October ninth?</i>

22:46.341 --> 22:47.676
<i>No.</i>

22:49.302 --> 22:52.222
<i>He stole the car
on October tenth.</i>

22:54.015 --> 22:57.978
<i>The day after the car
hit Rocco Baxter?</i>

23:02.482 --> 23:04.734
<i>Yes.</i>

23:04.734 --> 23:07.279
<i>So Kofi Jones wasn't
driving that car</i>

23:07.279 --> 23:10.782
<i>that was involved
in the hit-and-run?</i>

23:13.118 --> 23:14.494
<i>No.</i>

23:18.957 --> 23:20.333
<i>Who was driving?</i>

23:22.669 --> 23:24.713
<i>tense music</i>

23:27.466 --> 23:29.634
<i>My son.</i>

23:29.634 --> 23:31.386
<i>Adam.</i>

23:48.528 --> 23:50.447
<i>Don't you dare.</i>

23:50.447 --> 23:52.449
<i>Fia, I'm... I'm so...</i>

23:52.449 --> 23:53.617
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

23:53.617 --> 23:54.826
<i>For what?</i>

23:54.826 --> 23:56.912
<i>For lying to me
this entire time?</i>

23:56.912 --> 23:59.289
<i>Or for covering up
my brother's death?</i>

24:01.625 --> 24:03.210
<i>I didn't want to hurt you.</i>

24:03.210 --> 24:05.337
<i>You failed.</i>

24:07.672 --> 24:09.424
<i>You're a liar.</i>

24:09.424 --> 24:11.676
<i>And so was your son.</i>

24:11.676 --> 24:13.720
Oh, Fia...

24:20.685 --> 24:22.687
<i>Well, based on Desiato's
testimony today--</i>

24:22.687 --> 24:24.648
<i>How fucked are we?</i>

24:24.648 --> 24:27.025
<i>He-he hasn't said anything that
implicates anyone in this room.</i>

24:27.025 --> 24:28.151
<i>Yet.</i>

24:28.151 --> 24:29.945
<i>So, then...</i>

24:29.945 --> 24:31.780
<i>how exposed are we?</i>

24:31.780 --> 24:34.282
<i>Well, that depends
on what Desiato might say,</i>

24:34.282 --> 24:35.659
<i>and on what he can prove.</i>

24:35.659 --> 24:37.035
<i>Well, it's simple then.</i>

24:37.035 --> 24:38.703
<i>Let's make sure
he never talks again.</i>

24:38.703 --> 24:40.121
<i>Shut the fuck up, Carmine.</i>

24:40.121 --> 24:42.666
<i>Don't you talk
to my father that way.</i>

24:42.666 --> 24:45.752
<i>I can make sure
you never talk again, too.</i>

24:45.752 --> 24:47.254
Okay, okay.

24:47.254 --> 24:49.756
<i>A couple of things,
since we're all here.</i>

24:49.756 --> 24:50.882
<i>A couple of reminders.</i>

24:50.882 --> 24:52.551
<i>One, attorney-client privilege</i>

24:52.551 --> 24:54.386
<i>does not extend
to future crimes.</i>

24:54.386 --> 24:56.388
<i>Two, it certainly doesn't
extend to crimes</i>

24:56.388 --> 24:58.056
<i>that you planned in my presence.</i>

24:58.056 --> 24:59.724
<i>He was just blowing
off a little steam.</i>

24:59.724 --> 25:01.643
<i>Yeah, but he's got
a point though.</i>

25:01.643 --> 25:03.186
<i>If we could get rid of Michael--</i>

25:03.186 --> 25:04.729
<i>Okay, I'm going to take
a walk around the hotel.</i>

25:04.729 --> 25:05.897
<i>Talk amongst yourselves
while I'm gone.</i>

25:05.897 --> 25:07.566
<i>Wait, wait. Wait.</i>

25:08.858 --> 25:12.904
<i>What do you recommend we do
right now, this very minute?</i>

25:12.904 --> 25:16.241
<i>Nothing. Nothing.</i>

25:16.241 --> 25:19.995
<i>All Michael did today
was implicate himself.</i>

25:19.995 --> 25:23.415
<i>So then we return to court
tomorrow, as a family...</i>

25:25.959 --> 25:28.920
<i>...and show we have
nothing to hide.</i>

25:34.926 --> 25:36.511
Fia...?

25:41.224 --> 25:43.435
<i>Oh, God.</i>

25:43.435 --> 25:46.438
It's all right, it's all right.

25:48.023 --> 25:50.525
<i>It's all right.</i>

25:54.154 --> 25:55.614
<i>It's all right.</i>

26:11.671 --> 26:13.256
<i>You did a good job today.</i>

26:13.256 --> 26:16.593
<i>Negligent homicide, time served.</i>

26:16.593 --> 26:19.512
<i>You didn't do
that good of a job.</i>

26:20.221 --> 26:23.975
<i>Your boss is in real danger of
having to retry every conviction</i>

26:23.975 --> 26:25.810
<i>from Desiato's courtroom.</i>

26:25.810 --> 26:29.064
<i>Every defense lawyer will
file an appeal for retrial,</i>

26:29.064 --> 26:32.233
<i>every prosecutor will be forced
to double their workload.</i>

26:32.233 --> 26:36.321
<i>The district attorney's
reelection hopes, dashed.</i>

26:36.321 --> 26:37.989
<i>I've already
got Michael talking.</i>

26:37.989 --> 26:39.532
<i>Who knows what else
he's willing to say?</i>

26:41.785 --> 26:46.289
<i>One thing he will say is that
Eugene Jones killed his son.</i>

26:46.289 --> 26:49.501
<i>You really think you can
plead this down, Lee?</i>

26:50.835 --> 26:53.588
<i>Your narrative is crumbling.</i>

26:53.588 --> 26:56.758
<i>Eugene is as much a victim
as he is a culprit.</i>

26:56.758 --> 26:59.135
<i>You need to convince 12 people</i>

26:59.135 --> 27:02.597
<i>that this kid hasn't
already suffered enough.</i>

27:02.597 --> 27:04.265
<i>It's too late now, Lee.</i>

27:04.265 --> 27:06.518
<i>I'll take my chances
with the verdict.</i>

27:15.860 --> 27:16.861
<i>Hey.</i>

27:16.861 --> 27:18.738
<i>What'd the prosecutor say?</i>

27:18.738 --> 27:20.365
<i>Don't worry about him.</i>

27:20.365 --> 27:22.158
<i>The jury heard what happened.</i>

27:22.158 --> 27:24.869
They heard Michael's story.

27:24.869 --> 27:27.831
<i>Well, would it help
if they hear mine?</i>

27:27.831 --> 27:29.624
<i>I don't know.</i>

27:32.460 --> 27:35.505
<i>Everybody's just always
trying to make me disappear.</i>

27:35.505 --> 27:37.215
<i>And I'm tired of hiding.</i>

27:40.260 --> 27:42.303
<i>You don't have to testify.</i>

27:42.303 --> 27:45.724
<i>Yeah. I do.</i>

<i>contemplative music</i>

27:57.026 --> 27:59.070
<i>I don't even know
where to begin.</i>

28:02.574 --> 28:05.744
<i>I covered up a crime.</i>

28:05.744 --> 28:07.620
<i>I destroyed evidence.</i>

28:09.164 --> 28:11.416
<i>I lied to the police.</i>

28:11.416 --> 28:13.460
<i>I told Adam to lie.</i>

28:23.428 --> 28:26.264
<i>You did it all to protect Adam?</i>

28:28.224 --> 28:29.934
<i>Yeah.</i>

28:33.772 --> 28:37.108
<i>Then that's all you
got to say to me.</i>

28:46.409 --> 28:48.870
<i>Have you come to arrest me?</i>

28:50.163 --> 28:52.791
<i>After your testimony today...</i>

28:56.836 --> 28:58.797
<i>I'm here to protect you.</i>

29:27.367 --> 29:29.327
<i>How old are you, Eugene?</i>

29:29.327 --> 29:30.745
I'm 16.

29:30.745 --> 29:32.789
And where are you from?

29:32.789 --> 29:34.833
<i>Uh, New Orleans.</i>

29:34.833 --> 29:36.960
<i>The Lower Ninth.
Born and raised.</i>

29:36.960 --> 29:40.004
<i>Where were you on the morning
of October ninth?</i>

29:40.004 --> 29:42.632
<i>Uh, I was in
Judge Desiato's courtroom.</i>

29:42.632 --> 29:44.759
Why?

29:44.759 --> 29:47.470
<i>My mom had been
busted for possession.</i>

29:47.470 --> 29:50.974
<i>What happened
that day in court?</i>

29:50.974 --> 29:53.226
<i>Judge Desiato had let her go.</i>

29:54.185 --> 29:55.645
Why?

29:55.645 --> 29:57.188
<i>Uh, because
the cop that arrested her</i>

29:57.188 --> 29:59.691
<i>had lied about
seeing her hide drugs.</i>

29:59.691 --> 30:02.277
<i>And were you in court alone?</i>

30:02.277 --> 30:03.820
<i>No.</i>

30:03.820 --> 30:06.489
<i>Your three youngest
siblings were with you?</i>

30:06.489 --> 30:08.366
<i>Yeah. I was taking care of them.</i>

30:08.366 --> 30:10.326
<i>So you and your family
went home.</i>

30:10.326 --> 30:12.370
<i>What happened the next day?</i>

30:12.996 --> 30:15.874
<i>Cops arrested
my older brother Kofi</i>

30:15.874 --> 30:17.417
<i>for stealing
Judge Desiato's car.</i>

30:17.417 --> 30:20.336
<i>And that's how
he came to be charged</i>

30:20.336 --> 30:23.923
<i>with the hit-and-run
that killed Rocco Baxter?</i>

30:23.923 --> 30:25.550
<i>Yeah.</i>

30:25.550 --> 30:28.553
<i>Did you have any more
run-ins with the police?</i>

30:28.553 --> 30:29.929
They had raided our house,

30:29.929 --> 30:31.389
<i>and they were looking
for a phone.</i>

30:31.389 --> 30:33.725
<i>Rocco's phone, I guess.</i>

30:33.725 --> 30:35.894
<i>But they didn't find it?</i>

30:35.894 --> 30:37.520
<i>No.</i>

30:37.520 --> 30:39.939
<i>Because my brother
didn't kill Rocco.</i>

30:39.939 --> 30:42.191
<i>And, as we've already heard,</i>

30:42.191 --> 30:44.569
<i>even though your brother
didn't kill Rocco Baxter,</i>

30:44.569 --> 30:48.406
<i>Rocco's brother killed
Kofi in jail.</i>

30:48.406 --> 30:50.491
<i>How did you learn about that?</i>

30:50.491 --> 30:53.286
<i>I, um...</i>

30:53.286 --> 30:55.413
<i>I heard my mom crying
in the other room.</i>

30:55.413 --> 30:58.082
<i>She kept calling his name.</i>

30:59.125 --> 31:02.045
What happened the following day?

31:02.045 --> 31:04.005
<i>Um...</i>

31:05.089 --> 31:07.050
<i>The next day...</i>

31:07.050 --> 31:11.137
<i>I went to go get us some food.</i>

31:13.056 --> 31:14.849
<i>Because...</i>

31:14.849 --> 31:17.185
<i>we hadn't eaten all day.</i>

31:20.772 --> 31:23.608
<i>And I was walking back
to the house...</i>

31:28.488 --> 31:30.740
<i>...and it exploded.</i>

31:34.285 --> 31:37.705
<i>With your mother
and your siblings inside?</i>

31:42.335 --> 31:44.128
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

31:44.128 --> 31:45.588
What did you think had happened?

31:45.588 --> 31:48.257
<i>Objection.
Calls for speculation.</i>

31:48.257 --> 31:50.593
Sustained.

31:52.303 --> 31:55.139
<i>What was going through your head</i>

31:55.139 --> 31:58.476
<i>when you saw that your house
was engulfed in flames?</i>

32:01.104 --> 32:02.480
<i>That the Baxters did this.</i>

32:02.480 --> 32:03.815
Objection.

32:03.815 --> 32:05.441
<i>Your Honor,
to call that speculation</i>

32:05.441 --> 32:06.484
<i>is an understatement.</i>

32:06.484 --> 32:07.819
<i>There was an investigation</i>

32:07.819 --> 32:09.612
<i>and a police report
that concluded</i>

32:09.612 --> 32:12.240
<i>that the explosion of
the Jones home was an accident.</i>

32:12.240 --> 32:13.783
<i>The result of a gas leak.</i>

32:13.783 --> 32:15.076
Sustained.

32:15.076 --> 32:18.079
<i>Strike the witness's
last answer.</i>

32:18.079 --> 32:20.248
<i>Members of the jury,
you are to disregard</i>

32:20.248 --> 32:22.500
<i>what the witness just said.</i>

32:22.500 --> 32:24.794
<i>Eugene, were you ever made aware</i>

32:24.794 --> 32:29.173
<i>of any investigations into
the death of your family?</i>

32:29.173 --> 32:30.717
No.

32:30.717 --> 32:34.846
<i>How do you feel about the same
police department</i>

32:34.846 --> 32:39.642
<i>that falsely accused your
brother of killing Rocco Baxter</i>

32:39.642 --> 32:42.186
<i>also failing to uncover
the truth</i>

32:42.186 --> 32:43.521
<i>about your family's death?</i>

32:43.521 --> 32:44.856
<i>Objection.</i>

32:44.856 --> 32:46.816
<i>Your Honor,
this is a ploy by counsel</i>

32:46.816 --> 32:48.693
<i>to engender sympathy
for her client</i>

32:48.693 --> 32:51.863
<i>by mischaracterizing the deaths
of a mother and her children.</i>

32:51.863 --> 32:53.489
<i>They have names.</i>

32:56.451 --> 32:58.870
What did you say, Mr. Jones?

33:00.163 --> 33:02.498
<i>Everyone keeps saying...</i>

33:04.250 --> 33:08.046
<i>..."mother and her children."</i>

33:08.046 --> 33:11.382
<i>My mom was Female Jones,</i>

33:11.382 --> 33:14.510
<i>and her kids were Goodluck,</i>

33:14.510 --> 33:17.013
<i>Sophie...</i>

33:17.013 --> 33:18.723
<i>and Rose.</i>

33:20.892 --> 33:22.310
<i>And they have names.</i>

<i>gentle music</i>

33:34.280 --> 33:36.032
<i>Could we take a short recess?</i>

33:36.032 --> 33:37.366
<i>Yes.</i>

33:37.366 --> 33:40.912
<i>Um, we'll come back
at quarter after.</i>

34:06.938 --> 34:09.941
<i>Lee. Lee. I need to talk to you.</i>

34:09.941 --> 34:11.025
<i>Leave me alone, Michael.
- No, please.</i>

34:11.025 --> 34:12.110
<i>Just give me a minute. Please.</i>

34:12.110 --> 34:13.111
<i>I have nothing to say to you.</i>

34:13.111 --> 34:14.278
<i>Look, I'll catch you, okay?</i>

34:14.278 --> 34:16.781
<i>Eugene had to go
get food, right?</i>

34:16.781 --> 34:18.199
<i>So what?</i>

34:18.199 --> 34:20.118
<i>He was in my courtroom
days earlier.</i>

34:20.118 --> 34:21.786
<i>We had a conversation.</i>

34:21.786 --> 34:23.955
<i>It's part
of the official record.</i>

34:23.955 --> 34:27.125
<i>dramatic music
-</i>

34:31.587 --> 34:35.591
<i>Eugene, do you know the term
"survivor's guilt"?</i>

34:35.591 --> 34:36.968
No.

34:36.968 --> 34:38.636
When someone close to us dies,

34:38.636 --> 34:42.098
<i>sometimes we who didn't perish
feel guilty</i>

34:42.098 --> 34:45.268
<i>about still being alive.</i>

34:45.268 --> 34:47.979
<i>Did you ever think about
how close you came</i>

34:47.979 --> 34:50.648
<i>to dying with the rest
of your family that night?</i>

34:52.817 --> 34:54.652
<i>Yeah.</i>

34:54.652 --> 34:56.070
<i>All the time.</i>

34:57.238 --> 34:59.615
<i>Do you ever feel bad,
like you...</i>

34:59.615 --> 35:02.160
<i>did something wrong</i>

35:02.160 --> 35:06.038
<i>to not be with them
when tragedy struck?</i>

35:07.707 --> 35:09.333
<i>Yeah.</i>

35:11.335 --> 35:14.630
<i>Why did you leave
the house that night?</i>

35:15.882 --> 35:18.009
<i>Everybody was hungry.</i>

35:18.009 --> 35:20.636
<i>Was it often your
responsibility to...</i>

35:20.636 --> 35:23.514
<i>feed Goodluck, Sophie and Rose?</i>

35:23.514 --> 35:25.516
<i>Even your mom?</i>

35:27.685 --> 35:30.354
<i>She just didn't have it
in her sometimes.</i>

35:33.065 --> 35:35.860
<i>Eugene, you said earlier
that you were</i>

35:35.860 --> 35:39.155
<i>in Judge Desiato's courtroom
for your mother's hearing.</i>

35:39.155 --> 35:41.032
<i>Did you participate
in any way in that hearing?</i>

35:41.032 --> 35:45.328
<i>Uh, yeah, the judge
had asked me some questions.</i>

35:45.328 --> 35:47.121
<i>Defense would like to submit</i>

35:47.121 --> 35:51.125
<i>the hearing transcript for
Female Jones into the record.</i>

35:55.213 --> 35:56.547
<i>I'm going to read to you
the questions</i>

35:56.547 --> 35:58.758
<i>that Judge Desiato asked you.</i>

35:58.758 --> 36:00.801
<i>And I want you to read
the answers</i>

36:00.801 --> 36:02.553
<i>that you gave that day.</i>

36:04.889 --> 36:06.974
<i>"Please tell the court
your name."</i>

36:06.974 --> 36:08.184
<i>"Eugene."</i>

36:08.184 --> 36:09.810
<i>"Eugene, where is your father?"</i>

36:09.810 --> 36:10.895
<i>"Busy."</i>

36:10.895 --> 36:11.896
<i>"With what?"</i>

36:11.896 --> 36:13.439
<i>"Side girlfriend."</i>

36:13.439 --> 36:16.192
<i>"When was
the last time you saw him?"</i>

36:18.236 --> 36:20.071
<i>"I don't know."</i>

36:20.988 --> 36:24.742
<i>"What did you eat
for breakfast, Eugene?"</i>

36:24.742 --> 36:26.577
<i>"We had some pickle juice.</i>

36:26.577 --> 36:29.538
<i>Hot fries sometimes
when we're helped out."</i>

36:29.538 --> 36:31.874
<i>"And who helps you out?"</i>

36:31.874 --> 36:34.168
<i>"My older brother, sometimes."</i>

36:34.168 --> 36:38.297
<i>You had to survive
on pickle juice and hot fries?</i>

36:39.548 --> 36:41.759
Well, whatever was around.

36:41.759 --> 36:44.095
<i>We had cereal, too.</i>

36:44.095 --> 36:46.597
Eggs, bacon?

36:46.597 --> 36:48.599
<i>No, none of that stuff.</i>

36:48.599 --> 36:50.434
Why not?

36:51.644 --> 36:54.063
<i>We couldn't cook.</i>

36:54.063 --> 36:56.107
<i>dark, atmospheric music</i>

37:03.114 --> 37:05.408
<i>We couldn't cook...</i>

37:05.408 --> 37:08.369
<i>because we didn't have any gas.</i>

37:08.369 --> 37:11.539
Your gas had been shut off.

37:11.539 --> 37:14.750
<i>Eugene, are you sure about that?</i>

37:14.750 --> 37:18.129
<i>Yeah, we-we didn't have enough
money for-for bills, or...</i>

37:21.090 --> 37:23.134
<i>We didn't have gas for weeks.</i>

37:55.833 --> 37:57.543
<i>Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,</i>

37:57.543 --> 38:00.629
<i>please be here at 8:30
tomorrow morning.</i>

38:00.629 --> 38:01.964
<i>We are now adjourned.</i>

38:08.346 --> 38:11.140
<i>Could you just give us
a couple of minutes?</i>

38:13.517 --> 38:15.353
<i>You were great today.</i>

38:15.353 --> 38:16.979
<i>Am I done?</i>

38:16.979 --> 38:19.523
<i>The prosecution still gets
to cross-examine you.</i>

38:19.523 --> 38:21.650
<i>Judge Desiato.</i>

38:42.755 --> 38:44.548
<i>I'm sorry about Adam.</i>

38:47.885 --> 38:49.553
<i>I know.</i>

38:51.764 --> 38:54.642
<i>I'm sorry too, Eugene.</i>

39:11.534 --> 39:13.244
<i>What's your plan now?</i>

39:15.788 --> 39:17.289
<i>What do you want me to say?</i>

39:17.289 --> 39:19.417
<i>That I'll fall on my sword
if I have to?</i>

39:19.417 --> 39:21.710
<i>That's the least you could do.</i>

39:22.795 --> 39:24.588
<i>Are we to overlook the fact</i>

39:24.588 --> 39:27.967
<i>that sending a message to the
Jones family was your idea?</i>

39:30.803 --> 39:34.890
<i>You are a pathetic excuse
for a man.</i>

39:34.890 --> 39:36.934
<i>And I can't believe my father
ever trusted you</i>

39:36.934 --> 39:39.270
<i>with the Conti family.</i>

39:40.521 --> 39:42.273
<i>It's the best decision
he ever made.</i>

39:46.110 --> 39:47.194
<i>Fia...</i>

39:47.194 --> 39:48.946
<i>Give him to me.
- Wait, Fia.</i>

39:48.946 --> 39:51.073
<i>Fia, no.
- Get off me, Carlo.</i>

39:51.073 --> 39:52.616
<i>Just calm down.
- Get off me!</i>

39:52.616 --> 39:53.784
Please, calm down.

39:53.784 --> 39:54.869
Give him to me!

39:54.869 --> 39:56.912
<i>Give me my fucking child, Carlo.</i>

39:56.912 --> 39:58.247
<i>It's not right!</i>

39:58.247 --> 39:59.748
<i>No, not while you're
in this state.</i>

39:59.748 --> 40:01.917
<i>Give me my fucking son!
Get off me, Carlo.</i>

40:01.917 --> 40:04.128
<i>Relax.
You need to calm down.</i>

40:04.128 --> 40:05.463
<i>Calm down!</i>

40:05.463 --> 40:08.132
<i>Don't you fucking touch me.</i>

40:08.132 --> 40:11.427
<i>You killed an innocent woman
and her children.</i>

40:11.427 --> 40:13.095
<i>You are monsters!</i>

40:13.095 --> 40:15.097
<i>All of you.</i>

40:16.432 --> 40:18.267
<i>Did you know about Adam, too?</i>

40:20.478 --> 40:22.646
<i>Oh...</i>

40:22.646 --> 40:24.273
<i>No! No!</i>

40:24.273 --> 40:28.402
<i>Calm down. Calm down.
-</i>

40:37.244 --> 40:38.621
<i>Hey.</i>

40:38.621 --> 40:41.499
<i>You did so well in court today.</i>

40:41.499 --> 40:44.710
<i>Yeah, well, I've got another
big day tomorrow, so...</i>

40:44.710 --> 40:46.504
<i>Can you tell me
what you found out?</i>

40:46.504 --> 40:48.255
<i>Yeah, absolutely.</i>

40:48.255 --> 40:50.174
<i>We went to, um, Entergy
New Orleans this afternoon.</i>

40:50.174 --> 40:51.842
<i>Checked the records.</i>

40:51.842 --> 40:54.929
<i>The Jones family hadn't paid
their gas bill in months.</i>

40:54.929 --> 40:57.181
<i>Eugene was right. The gas
was turned off seven weeks</i>

40:57.181 --> 40:58.641
<i>before the explosion.</i>

40:58.641 --> 40:59.934
<i>On top of that,</i>

40:59.934 --> 41:02.019
<i>the investigation
into the explosion</i>

41:02.019 --> 41:04.522
<i>was headed by
Lieutenant Brendan Cusack.</i>

41:04.522 --> 41:06.857
<i>I'm pretty sure he's
Baxter-owned.</i>

41:06.857 --> 41:10.027
<i>So, if Eugene agrees
to be a cooperating witness</i>

41:10.027 --> 41:12.029
<i>against the Baxters,
the federal government</i>

41:12.029 --> 41:14.949
<i>will grant him
protective custody.</i>

41:17.910 --> 41:19.870
<i>I can't be sure
that he witnessed</i>

41:19.870 --> 41:22.373
<i>any criminal activity
from the Baxters.</i>

41:23.582 --> 41:25.834
<i>Well, then I guess I won't
be able to call on him.</i>

41:28.295 --> 41:29.713
<i>Then why?</i>

41:29.713 --> 41:32.800
<i>Because I want to help this kid.</i>

41:36.804 --> 41:38.347
<i>So no prison time?</i>

41:38.347 --> 41:40.307
<i>You'll be free tomorrow.</i>

41:41.767 --> 41:44.019
<i>Can I go back to Houston?</i>

41:44.603 --> 41:49.024
<i>Eugene, you saw what the
Baxters did to your family.</i>

41:49.024 --> 41:50.734
<i>You'll never be safe in Houston,</i>

41:50.734 --> 41:53.904
<i>or anywhere that people
know where to look for you.</i>

41:53.904 --> 41:57.908
<i>No one can know where you are,
or who you are.</i>

41:57.908 --> 42:00.077
<i>I can't give up my name.</i>

42:01.453 --> 42:03.497
<i>It's the only part of them
that I got left.</i>

42:03.497 --> 42:04.665
Eugene...?

42:04.665 --> 42:07.334
<i>For the rest of your life,</i>

42:07.334 --> 42:10.254
<i>whenever you hear someone
say the name Eugene,</i>

42:10.254 --> 42:12.756
<i>your heart is going
to skip a beat.</i>

42:12.756 --> 42:14.592
<i>You're going to be forever
looking over your shoulder</i>

42:14.592 --> 42:16.427
<i>for someone who isn't there.</i>

42:16.427 --> 42:20.514
<i>You're going to feel alive
and destroyed all over again.</i>

42:24.268 --> 42:27.187
<i>Hey. Look at me.</i>

42:27.187 --> 42:31.609
<i>Regardless of what
anyone calls you,</i>

42:31.609 --> 42:35.904
<i>you will always be Kofi's
brother and Female's son.</i>

42:36.989 --> 42:39.783
<i>You'll always be Eugene Jones,</i>

42:39.783 --> 42:42.911
<i>because that name is
a part of who you are.</i>

42:42.911 --> 42:46.582
<i>And no one can take that
away from you.</i>

42:56.634 --> 42:58.802
<i>I told you
I'm done negotiating, Lee.</i>

42:58.802 --> 43:00.346
<i>You're just here to watch.</i>

43:00.346 --> 43:02.973
<i>The Justice Department
has offered my client</i>

43:02.973 --> 43:04.600
<i>witness protection.</i>

43:04.600 --> 43:05.643
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

43:05.643 --> 43:07.061
<i>I did not agree to that.</i>

43:07.061 --> 43:09.146
<i>Oh, did I forget to mention</i>

43:09.146 --> 43:12.816
<i>the U.S. Attorney's Office is
taking this case away from you.</i>

43:12.816 --> 43:15.486
<i>This meeting
was just a courtesy.</i>

43:22.826 --> 43:25.245
<i>I just found out that...</i>

43:25.245 --> 43:27.498
<i>the guy that I fell in love with</i>

43:27.498 --> 43:30.000
<i>is the one who killed
my brother.</i>

43:30.959 --> 43:33.504
<i>And they knew.</i>

43:33.504 --> 43:36.340
<i>They knew
and they didn't tell me.</i>

43:39.760 --> 43:42.888
<i>Do you think you can
find forgiveness in your heart?</i>

43:46.225 --> 43:49.061
<i>I think for Adam I already have.</i>

43:52.898 --> 43:55.734
<i>I'm so mad at him.</i>

43:58.278 --> 44:01.657
<i>But I also believe
that he really loved me.</i>

44:03.242 --> 44:05.202
<i>I still feel it.</i>

44:07.246 --> 44:11.041
<i>But I don't know
if I can forgive my family.</i>

44:11.041 --> 44:13.001
<i>The things they've done...</i>

44:13.001 --> 44:15.003
<i>somber music</i>

44:17.256 --> 44:19.133
<i>Is it fucked up
if the only reason</i>

44:19.133 --> 44:22.177
<i>I'm willing to entertain
the notion that God exists</i>

44:22.177 --> 44:25.055
<i>is because I'm certain
that the devil does?</i>

44:30.769 --> 44:33.897
<i>I don't know why bad things
happen to us.</i>

44:35.941 --> 44:39.403
<i>But suffering is a part
of the human experience,</i>

44:39.403 --> 44:41.488
<i>and it's never fair.</i>

44:43.949 --> 44:46.160
<i>I wouldn't wish it upon anyone.</i>

44:47.911 --> 44:51.915
<i>But I do believe
the pain you endure here</i>

44:51.915 --> 44:55.085
<i>will be transformed
into everlasting love.</i>

44:58.088 --> 45:00.883
<i>If Heaven does exist,</i>

45:00.883 --> 45:03.927
<i>Rocco is the only one
who's going to be there.</i>

45:07.431 --> 45:09.641
<i>I don't have
a lot of answers, Fia.</i>

45:10.934 --> 45:15.564
<i>Especially ones that
will help you right now.</i>

45:17.566 --> 45:20.861
<i>But... Look at me.</i>

45:20.861 --> 45:23.197
<i>There is a Heaven.</i>

45:23.197 --> 45:25.115
<i>As sure as we're sitting here.</i>

45:25.115 --> 45:29.453
<i>And your brother
is there, right now.</i>

45:31.914 --> 45:35.209
<i>I need that to be true.</i>

45:35.209 --> 45:37.711
<i>I need to know...</i>

45:37.711 --> 45:39.463
<i>that when we lose someone,</i>

45:39.463 --> 45:42.007
<i>we haven't lost them forever.</i>

45:49.848 --> 45:52.434
<i>"Tally" by Denzel Curry
and midwxst</i>

45:52.434 --> 45:54.478
<i>I met this girl
down in Tally</i>

45:54.478 --> 45:56.355
<i>She said she flew in
from Cali</i>

45:56.355 --> 45:58.315
<i>Not L.A. though,
she live in the Valley</i>

45:58.315 --> 46:00.192
<i>Got a twin and I think
her name Sally</i>

46:00.192 --> 46:02.277
<i>Not my type,
so I curved her real proudly</i>

46:02.277 --> 46:04.154
<i>Don't remember last night,
it was cloudy...</i>

46:04.154 --> 46:05.614
<i>What the hell do you want?</i>

46:05.614 --> 46:07.324
<i>Just hoping to talk
to the man of the house.</i>

46:07.324 --> 46:08.534
<i>He's indisposed.</i>

46:08.534 --> 46:10.202
<i>Oh, that's too bad.</i>

46:10.202 --> 46:11.620
<i>Just curious to see if
he'd given any more thought</i>

46:11.620 --> 46:13.705
<i>to my offer he rejected, but...</i>

46:14.957 --> 46:17.042
<i>What offer?</i>

46:17.042 --> 46:19.294
<i>Oh, he didn't tell you?</i>

46:19.294 --> 46:21.505
<i>I tried to sell him the club.</i>

46:21.505 --> 46:24.174
<i>Knew you'd want to get me
off the block, but...</i>

46:24.174 --> 46:26.385
<i>guess it doesn't matter to him.</i>

46:30.055 --> 46:31.348
<i>Excuse me.</i>

46:38.230 --> 46:40.399
<i>Now that's my long game.</i>

<i>moody, pulsing music</i>

46:57.541 --> 46:59.793
<i>What happened, darling?</i>

46:59.793 --> 47:01.628
<i>What's wrong?
- Pop.</i>

47:01.628 --> 47:03.839
<i>What, what?</i>

47:03.839 --> 47:05.924
<i>It's Jimmy.</i>

47:05.924 --> 47:08.552
<i>He blames me for what he did
to that Jones family.</i>

47:08.552 --> 47:11.179
<i>He's always held it against me.</i>

47:11.179 --> 47:14.141
<i>It's all right. It'll be okay.</i>

47:14.141 --> 47:17.936
<i>Papa, he's going to confess
to the police.</i>

47:17.936 --> 47:19.813
<i>What?</i>

47:19.813 --> 47:22.274
<i>Jimmy's threatened to implicate
me too because he hates me.</i>

47:22.274 --> 47:24.443
<i>He told me that.</i>

47:24.443 --> 47:25.903
<i>He wants to take me down.</i>

47:25.903 --> 47:27.571
<i>He's gonna destroy us.</i>

<i>You were never my family.</i>

<i>I'm calling from
the Baxter House.</i>

48:50.821 --> 48:52.906
<i>I just heard gunshots.</i>

49:57.929 --> 49:59.765
<i>Stay out of trouble, okay?</i>

50:17.449 --> 50:20.368
<i>So now what are you going to do?</i>

50:24.456 --> 50:26.625
<i>I have no idea.</i>

50:32.631 --> 50:35.926
<i>You can sell anywhere
in the Quarter.</i>

50:35.926 --> 50:38.261
<i>Except on my street.</i>

50:41.139 --> 50:44.559
<i>I'm looking forward to a new era
in our special relationship.</i>

51:01.243 --> 51:03.495
The whole city's ours.

<i>Real soon, we're gonna be
minting cash.</i>

51:14.798 --> 51:16.466
<i>Can I help you?</i>

51:16.466 --> 51:19.678
<i>Yeah. Any chance y'all
looking for performers?</i>

51:21.972 --> 51:23.807
<i>New owner's across the street.</i>

51:23.807 --> 51:25.142
<i>You got to talk to her.</i>

51:26.226 --> 51:28.061
<i>All right.
- Mm.</i>

51:31.690 --> 51:33.525
<i>Hey, yo.</i>

51:35.402 --> 51:36.945
<i>Let me see what you got.</i>

<i>Uh... Yeah.</i>

51:40.699 --> 51:42.534
<i>Thank you.</i>

52:29.581 --> 52:33.376
<i>When the sins of my father</i>

52:35.253 --> 52:38.632
<i>Weigh down in my soul</i>

52:40.967 --> 52:44.888
<i>And the pain of my mother</i>

52:47.140 --> 52:49.601
<i>Will not let me go</i>

52:52.604 --> 52:57.192
<i>Well, I know there can
come fire from the sky</i>

52:58.109 --> 53:02.280
<i>To refine
the purest of kings</i>

53:04.032 --> 53:08.912
<i>And even though I know
this fire can bring me pain</i>

53:09.871 --> 53:13.416
<i>Even so, Lord, just the same</i>

53:13.416 --> 53:18.755
<i>Make it rain,

out of the ground</i>

<i>But it just keeps on
getting harder</i>

53:53.999 --> 53:56.084
<i>And harder</i>

53:56.084 --> 53:59.587
<i>And the hunger more profound</i>

54:01.548 --> 54:06.303
<i>Well, I know they can't
count tears from the eye</i>

54:07.262 --> 54:11.474
<i>But it may as well
be in vain</i>

these tears will bring me pain</i>

<i>Make it rain</i>

is filled with water</i>

56:02.877 --> 56:06.297
<i>Stops by the shore</i>

56:07.966 --> 56:12.720
<i>Just like the riches
of grandeur</i>

<i>But it'll never reach,
never reach the poor</i>

56:19.018 --> 56:24.107
<i>Well, let the clouds fill
with thunderous applause</i>

56:25.316 --> 56:29.279
<i>And the lightning
be the veins</i>

56:30.822 --> 56:32.699
<i>Fill the sky</i>
