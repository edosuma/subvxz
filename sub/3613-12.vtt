WEBVTT

00:07.174 --> 00:08.884
Of course I know
what a jack is, Phoebe.

00:09.051 --> 00:10.385
I just don't know how to use it.

00:10.552 --> 00:14.389
It's not like I've ever got a flat tire before.
This doesn't happen to me every day.

00:16.558 --> 00:19.394
Piper, relax. I used to date a mechanic,
I will walk you through it.

00:19.561 --> 00:23.273
Okay, you put the jack under the jeep
and then put the handle in the base

00:23.440 --> 00:25.942
and ratchet it up and down, okay?
It's very easy.

00:26.151 --> 00:28.570
Handle. Handle.

00:28.737 --> 00:30.739
I don't think I got a handle.

00:30.906 --> 00:33.575
Wait, there's a long wooden spoon
in the back.

00:33.783 --> 00:37.204
That's not gonna work. She's looking
for a long wooden spoon.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.414
Our table's ready.

00:40.457 --> 00:43.418
Okay. Okay.

00:50.925 --> 00:53.636
- It didn't work.
- Stay there and we'll come get you.

00:53.845 --> 00:56.139
No, I can do it. I can figure it out.

00:56.348 --> 00:59.267
Piper, you're stranded and you're
all alone, and the only thing you have

00:59.434 --> 01:01.770
to protect yourself with
is a wooden spoon that's broken.

01:01.936 --> 01:05.440
And I have the power to freeze.
I'm fine. It's better than Mace.

01:05.607 --> 01:08.902
Okay, I gotta go before my battery
dies. I gotta call the Auto Club.

01:09.110 --> 01:13.573
<i>- I'll meet you there in a little bit.
- Piper, wait. Hello?</i>

01:13.740 --> 01:15.283
She is out of her mind.

01:15.450 --> 01:19.746
All right, we'll give her 15 minutes
and call back. Okay.

01:21.706 --> 01:23.625
<i>Directory assistance.
What city please?</i>

01:23.791 --> 01:26.836
San Francisco. Auto Club, please.

01:27.045 --> 01:29.881
So back to what we were
talking about.

01:30.048 --> 01:31.466
What do you think?

01:31.632 --> 01:34.969
- Well, I think it's a good idea.
- Great.

01:35.136 --> 01:39.015
- And I think it's a bad idea.
- How? How is it a bad idea?

01:39.182 --> 01:42.477
You need extra help for the auction,
and I need a job.

01:42.643 --> 01:46.022
Well, not only are we family,
but we live together.

01:46.230 --> 01:49.692
And I don't think that my wardrobe can
take the assault of your daily needs.

01:49.901 --> 01:52.987
Okay, I'm great with phones, better
with people and very computer-friendly.

01:53.154 --> 01:57.199
And with a paycheck, I could purchase
new clothes. So by hiring me,

01:57.408 --> 02:00.453
you'd actually be expanding
your wardrobe, not decreasing it.

02:00.995 --> 02:02.705
And I'd be eternally grateful.

02:03.414 --> 02:05.791
You really want to work
at Buckland's with me?

02:05.958 --> 02:08.961
When opportunity knocks,
I answer the door.

02:09.169 --> 02:12.006
The job is very demanding.
Auctions can be stressful.

02:12.214 --> 02:14.508
- I love a challenge.
- We work pretty long hours.

02:14.717 --> 02:17.303
Overtime is my friend.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.555
Plus, I just thought of something else.

02:19.722 --> 02:23.225
With my premonitions, I might just
be able to get you the straight dope

02:23.392 --> 02:25.561
without a trip to the office
water cooler.

02:25.769 --> 02:27.188
Don't push it.

02:27.605 --> 02:29.356
Right.

02:30.316 --> 02:31.817
So, what do you think?

02:33.110 --> 02:34.528
Can you start tomorrow?

02:35.070 --> 02:36.780
Yes.

02:36.947 --> 02:39.658
Hey, can you give me a ride?

02:41.285 --> 02:43.245
Hello?

02:43.412 --> 02:45.205
Oh, great.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:55.257 --> 02:57.092
No problem,

02:57.259 --> 03:01.722
for I bear the power of one.

04:34.605 --> 04:37.233
Everything's gonna be okay.

06:22.921 --> 06:25.173
- Piper Halliwell?
- Prue. Phoebe.

06:25.340 --> 06:28.176
- Andy, thanks for calling us.
- Please, she's like my sister too.

06:28.343 --> 06:30.429
She's in here.

06:32.389 --> 06:36.101
Oh, my God, that's a lot of blood.

06:36.268 --> 06:40.730
- Hey, sweetie.
- Oh, my God. Are you okay?

06:40.939 --> 06:43.608
Yeah, I'm fine.

06:43.775 --> 06:46.862
If I pass out and I need a transfusion,
I'm AB negative.

06:47.070 --> 06:49.197
It's very rare. It could be a problem.

06:49.406 --> 06:52.450
Try not to look at it. And just
so you know, I'm AB neg. Too.

06:52.951 --> 06:55.036
Plus, I love good food. Perfect donor.

06:56.955 --> 07:00.083
- So no stitches?
- No. It's not that deep.

07:01.209 --> 07:05.088
Follow up with your doctor
in the morning, though. Keep it dry,

07:05.296 --> 07:07.257
a little aspirin for the pain.
You'll be fine.

07:07.757 --> 07:10.635
- Easy for you to say.
- You're all set. Just sign this.

07:10.844 --> 07:12.262
Oh, I got it.

07:14.013 --> 07:18.393
Come here, baby. I don't understand.
Why didn't you just freeze him?

07:18.560 --> 07:20.770
I was trapped in a phone booth.
My power doesn't work

07:20.937 --> 07:22.981
- outside the room I'm in, remember?
- Oh, right.

07:23.148 --> 07:25.233
- Oh, my God, Billy.
- How are you?

07:25.400 --> 07:27.652
Billy. This is Billy. He saved my life.

07:27.861 --> 07:30.905
- I'm just glad I got there in time.
- I'd like to talk to you about that.

07:31.114 --> 07:33.616
Along with that flare gun you
just happened to show up with.

07:37.745 --> 07:39.455
I don't think that you can smoke
in here.

07:39.622 --> 07:43.668
Oh, right. Look, it's no coincidence
I was there, inspector.

07:43.876 --> 07:46.003
I heard about the murder last night.
The creature...

07:46.212 --> 07:47.922
- The creature?
- Yeah, that's right.

07:48.131 --> 07:52.093
- Yes, creature. Absolutely.
- Describe it.

07:53.761 --> 07:56.139
- Billy, what are you doing here?
- Same thing you are.

07:56.305 --> 07:59.851
- Hunting that thing.
- Piper, Prue, Phoebe Halliwell,

08:00.017 --> 08:02.311
Special Agent Fallon of the FBI.

08:02.520 --> 08:05.565
- FBI. Cool.
- Describe it. Okay.

08:05.731 --> 08:07.900
Big, scary, strong,

08:08.067 --> 08:11.487
kind of like a cross between
a werewolf and Charles Manson.

08:11.654 --> 08:13.030
- Yellow eyes?
- Yes.

08:13.197 --> 08:15.491
Talon-like hands?

08:16.325 --> 08:17.785
Can I talk to you, inspector?

08:24.542 --> 08:27.294
Ms Halliwell's the first one
to survive an attack.

08:27.461 --> 08:30.464
Unlike that poor guy we found
last night with his heart ripped out.

08:30.673 --> 08:32.758
Just like the killings in Chicago
and New Orleans.

08:33.384 --> 08:36.220
- I've sent for the coroner's reports.
- Why?

08:36.428 --> 08:39.765
I think it's pretty obvious this case
is out of your jurisdiction, inspector.

08:40.640 --> 08:43.727
- On the bright side, you don't want it.
- Why's that?

08:43.936 --> 08:46.105
This witness corroborates
every other statement.

08:46.272 --> 08:50.985
According to their descriptions, this
perp's not either animal or human.

08:52.611 --> 08:54.738
You didn't blink. I was expecting
a response.

08:54.947 --> 08:57.741
- Just tell me what I'm looking for.
- You believe them?

08:57.908 --> 09:00.953
- That it's not human?
- Let's just say recent experiences

09:01.120 --> 09:03.038
have taught me to keep
an open mind.

09:05.165 --> 09:06.750
Cosy, aren't they?

09:06.917 --> 09:10.003
So, Billy, how did you know
to use a flare gun?

09:10.212 --> 09:13.173
- It's afraid of fire.
- How did you figure that out?

09:13.382 --> 09:17.970
Because when it attacked us,
me and my fiancée, Laura,

09:18.136 --> 09:21.723
we were camping by Lake Michigan
and I grabbed a log from the fire,

09:21.932 --> 09:24.601
it freaked, took off.

09:25.102 --> 09:26.979
But...

09:27.145 --> 09:29.106
...not before it ripped
Laura's heart out.

09:31.274 --> 09:33.944
Might as well have taken mine too.

09:34.653 --> 09:37.614
I came here to kill it.

09:43.203 --> 09:45.956
If that thing last night isn't demonic,
I don't know what is.

09:46.123 --> 09:47.791
Yeah, well, it's not your fight, Piper.

09:47.958 --> 09:50.877
Just let Andy and that FBI agent
handle it. Okay?

09:51.086 --> 09:54.673
Can't. That thing tried to kill me.
Besides, I was meant to be involved.

09:54.840 --> 09:58.468
I know that. It's no coincidence
I got that flat.

10:08.311 --> 10:09.980
- Nice outfit.
- Very corporate.

10:10.146 --> 10:13.274
Yeah, well I have to try to impress
my new boss.

10:13.441 --> 10:15.985
- Hey, how's the arm?
- Itches.

10:16.194 --> 10:19.823
Piper, you have got to go to the doctor,
okay? It could be infected.

10:19.989 --> 10:23.159
- It's not. It's fine.
- Here.

10:23.451 --> 10:25.787
Listen, you, while we're at work...

10:25.954 --> 10:28.373
Whoa, head rush.

10:28.540 --> 10:31.125
"While we're at work."

10:32.001 --> 10:34.754
Don't even think about going after
that thing alone.

10:35.380 --> 10:38.007
Wait, there's no reason to go
after it at all.

10:38.216 --> 10:41.594
- The only innocent to protect is Piper.
- I thought I was gonna die last night.

10:41.803 --> 10:43.262
I was totally helpless.

10:43.429 --> 10:46.182
All I could think about was I was never
gonna see you guys again.

10:46.391 --> 10:51.979
And then suddenly, out of nowhere,
comes Billy. Saved me. Protected me.

10:52.146 --> 10:55.233
That thing took away the person he
loved, and he's out there all alone

10:55.400 --> 10:58.945
trying to kill it. I can't just do nothing.

10:59.153 --> 11:02.365
Just don't do anything unless
we're together, okay? Promise?

11:06.452 --> 11:08.120
- Meet you outside.
- I'll be right there.

11:08.287 --> 11:09.664
Okay.

11:11.624 --> 11:14.543
- Okay, I'm freaking. I'm freaking.
- Why?

11:14.710 --> 11:18.506
Because I convinced Prue to hire me,
and what if I disappoint her?

11:18.714 --> 11:20.800
Or what if I screw up
and make her look bad?

11:21.008 --> 11:23.969
There's a reason my résumé
is only three sentences long, Piper.

11:24.178 --> 11:26.972
Stop. You're one
of the smartest people I know.

11:27.139 --> 11:28.683
I'm sure you'll do great.

11:28.891 --> 11:31.060
- You really mean that?
- Yes, I do.

11:31.268 --> 11:35.940
That makes me feel so much better.
Thank you.

11:47.952 --> 11:53.165
Lot number 102, one lamp.
Estimated value, $2500.

11:53.332 --> 11:55.209
What, it doesn't need light bulbs?

11:55.376 --> 11:59.630
- It's a Stickley, an original.
- Ah, right, a Stickley.

11:59.797 --> 12:02.424
I still can't believe none of this stuff
belongs to anyone.

12:02.591 --> 12:05.677
Yeah, well every year, the city
auctions off unclaimed probate items,

12:05.844 --> 12:07.304
asset seizures for revenue.

12:07.471 --> 12:09.139
What about the stuff that doesn't sell?

12:09.306 --> 12:11.934
It gets tossed. What is lot 103?

12:12.101 --> 12:15.395
103, gold bracelet.

12:15.562 --> 12:20.359
Estimated value, $375.
I will take that if no one wants it.

12:20.776 --> 12:23.612
Note that it's inscribed
with the initials T and L.

12:24.154 --> 12:26.865
All right, that finishes the first
grouping. I'm gonna go upstairs

12:27.032 --> 12:29.243
to Appraisals and make sure
we didn't forget anything.

12:29.618 --> 12:31.954
- Meet you back at my office?
- Your mid-morning coffee

12:32.120 --> 12:34.498
will be ready and waiting.

12:34.665 --> 12:36.708
I think this is really gonna work
with you and me.

12:37.125 --> 12:39.127
Me too.

12:49.346 --> 12:51.056
- Prue.
- Yeah?

12:51.264 --> 12:54.810
I just had a vision of the past.
It was a terrible car accident.

12:55.018 --> 12:57.896
- And this bracelet...
- What about it?

12:58.104 --> 13:00.023
It was thrown free.

13:00.190 --> 13:03.777
Oh, man. I bet I'm supposed
to figure out who it belongs to.

13:03.985 --> 13:06.947
Oh, no, no, no. Not now.

13:07.155 --> 13:09.032
- I can't help it.
- Prue?

13:09.199 --> 13:12.702
Just wanted to make sure everything's
in order for today's auction.

13:12.869 --> 13:14.537
Wait, the auction is today?

13:14.954 --> 13:17.082
Yes, Claire, everything's in order.

13:17.290 --> 13:19.292
Terrific. I'll see you later then.

13:21.920 --> 13:26.466
Ooh, nice. That should sell quickly.

13:28.343 --> 13:30.428
What are we gonna do?

13:35.225 --> 13:36.726
It's called a what?

13:36.893 --> 13:38.895
A Wendigo.

13:39.062 --> 13:41.522
Apparently, it looks like a normal
person during the day,

13:41.689 --> 13:43.858
but then transforms at night.

13:44.859 --> 13:47.695
It survives by feeding
on human hearts.

13:47.904 --> 13:49.489
What?

13:49.656 --> 13:53.868
According to my information,
the first Wendigo was a mortal who,

13:54.035 --> 13:58.373
betrayed by his lover,
cut out her heart and ate it.

13:58.539 --> 14:01.542
As soon as he did,
his own heart turned to ice

14:01.709 --> 14:05.004
and that's how he became
this monster.

14:05.213 --> 14:10.051
So, what, it, like... It takes love away
from others, is that it?

14:10.259 --> 14:11.594
Or...

14:11.969 --> 14:13.804
Then why did it go after you?

14:14.388 --> 14:17.058
Are you... in love?

14:17.266 --> 14:20.436
No. Unfortunately, no

14:20.603 --> 14:23.064
It must be attracted to something else.

14:23.272 --> 14:25.483
Like... maybe beauty?

14:27.902 --> 14:29.862
I'm sorry.

14:30.363 --> 14:31.739
It's just...

14:33.991 --> 14:36.410
...you remind me a lot of my fiancée.

14:41.957 --> 14:44.502
Anyway, from what I gather,
it strikes

14:44.668 --> 14:46.462
during the three phases
of the full moon.

14:46.629 --> 14:49.924
Which means it may try again tonight.

14:50.341 --> 14:51.717
That's what it did before.

14:51.884 --> 14:54.762
Amazing, you know I've been tracking
this thing for two months,

14:54.929 --> 14:58.057
and in one night you're a Ph.D.
In Wendigo.

14:58.265 --> 15:02.144
Yeah. Well, read more about it.

15:02.311 --> 15:06.231
I should call Andy. I mean,
Inspector Trudeau and tell him this.

15:06.440 --> 15:08.650
No. Agent Fallon's better.

15:08.817 --> 15:13.238
She's been so great to me
ever since Laura...

15:15.741 --> 15:18.452
And she's already a believer.

15:18.786 --> 15:21.789
I'll tell her, okay?

15:25.000 --> 15:26.627
- Dizzy.
- You okay?

15:26.793 --> 15:29.338
Must have stood up too fast.

15:30.672 --> 15:32.966
Will you call me after you see her?
Please?

15:33.467 --> 15:35.218
Sure.

15:35.844 --> 15:39.890
I can help, Billy. I can't tell you
exactly how or why,

15:40.057 --> 15:44.019
but I just want you to know I can.
You're not in this alone.

15:44.686 --> 15:46.605
I know.

15:55.697 --> 15:57.449
- Quake.
- Piper, it's Andy.

15:57.616 --> 15:59.201
Checking in to see how you're doing.

15:59.409 --> 16:03.413
Oh, Andy, that's sweet. I'm fine.
I'm just a little tired.

16:03.622 --> 16:05.332
Yeah, well, you should be
at home relaxing.

16:05.499 --> 16:08.460
<i>I'm okay. Listen, Billy Waters just left.</i>

16:08.668 --> 16:12.839
He's on his way to the Federal Building
to see Agent Fallon.

16:13.048 --> 16:14.883
<i>He has a theory on the attacks.</i>

16:15.050 --> 16:18.511
I'll let her know. You rest up, okay?

16:18.678 --> 16:21.014
And stay out of dark, scary places
for a while, will you?

16:21.514 --> 16:24.351
- Okay.
- Take care.

16:24.809 --> 16:27.896
Billy's on his way over to your office.
Has some information on the attacks.

16:28.521 --> 16:31.232
Really. I guess I'd better go.

16:31.399 --> 16:33.485
You seem pretty familiar
with the witness.

16:34.235 --> 16:38.948
- Piper? Yeah, I dated her sister.
- "Dated"? Past tense?

16:39.949 --> 16:42.869
- It's a long story. Why?
- Just curious.

16:43.036 --> 16:45.705
Wouldn't want a lovesick cop
on my hands.

16:45.872 --> 16:49.208
Especially if that's what
the creature is after.

16:49.584 --> 16:51.127
What makes you think it is?

16:51.336 --> 16:54.839
You got a better explanation for why
it rips the heart out of its victims?

16:55.006 --> 16:57.508
Maybe. I've just gone over
the coroner's reports

16:57.675 --> 17:00.511
from Chicago, New Orleans,
now local.

17:00.678 --> 17:02.638
Turns out all the victims
were AB negative.

17:03.389 --> 17:05.599
Chosen by blood type,
that's a new one.

17:05.808 --> 17:08.853
That, plus they're all killed in threes.
The night before, the night after

17:09.020 --> 17:11.355
and the night of the full moon.

17:11.521 --> 17:14.192
Piper would've been the second,
only she got away.

17:14.358 --> 17:17.319
Well, if you're right, that means
the creature will try again tonight.

17:17.528 --> 17:20.489
I'm not altogether convinced
it's a quote-unquote creature.

17:20.698 --> 17:23.659
The blood types, the full moon,
the stolen hearts,

17:23.867 --> 17:28.372
that feels like ritual.
And ritual is human.

17:29.790 --> 17:33.502
Could be just one sick mind
behind these crimes.

17:34.170 --> 17:37.381
Maybe we'll have a chance to confirm
your theory tonight.

17:37.548 --> 17:41.927
You and me, stakeout at the park.
Interested?

17:42.303 --> 17:44.430
I'll bring my flare gun.

17:53.189 --> 17:55.274
Billy. Looking for me?

17:55.441 --> 17:58.235
Yeah. Listen, I think I know
what that creature is.

17:58.402 --> 18:00.446
- Really?
- Yeah. Piper was telling me about it.

18:00.613 --> 18:03.824
- It's called a Wendigo, and it feeds...
- Hold on. Not here.

18:03.991 --> 18:06.118
The other agents already
think I'm a little weird.

18:06.285 --> 18:09.913
Why don't I walk you to your car,
and we'll talk on the way.

18:11.957 --> 18:14.793
It's like this Wendigo attacks
people in love

18:14.960 --> 18:17.755
or at least people with good hearts.

18:17.921 --> 18:19.715
It's sort of like an anti-Cupid.

18:19.882 --> 18:21.967
How does it know that
about its victims?

18:22.134 --> 18:24.470
I don't know. Instinct?

18:24.636 --> 18:27.890
Maybe it just senses something. Look,
I know it can take on human form.

18:28.056 --> 18:29.933
Maybe it stalks them first.

18:30.100 --> 18:34.021
Anyway, I know it's gonna
attack tonight. I know it.

18:34.188 --> 18:36.899
Probably in the same park
just like the other cities.

18:37.107 --> 18:39.359
- Interesting.
- Yeah. Well, we gotta get there,

18:39.568 --> 18:42.904
stake it out, we wait for it to show up,
so then we can...

18:44.281 --> 18:46.992
...kill it. Son of a bitch.

19:08.889 --> 19:12.100
Prue, check it out. I found out
whose car went off the cliff.

19:12.267 --> 19:15.604
Franklin Bates. He worked
for a big PI firm in San Jose.

19:15.770 --> 19:18.189
- How did you do that?
- Easy. I recognised the road.

19:18.356 --> 19:23.612
Coast Highway by Carmel.
I also recognised the car, '65 Lincoln.

19:23.778 --> 19:27.532
My first boyfriend, Jimmy, used
to drive one just like it. Remember?

19:27.699 --> 19:30.452
Anyway, so I got on the Web
and started snooping around,

19:30.618 --> 19:34.664
which means that I tied up your phone
lines while you were at Appraisals.

19:34.831 --> 19:37.459
<i>- Go on.
- I searched the Chronicle's databases</i>

19:37.625 --> 19:42.172
for all articles on car accidents
in the area, and voilà,

19:42.338 --> 19:45.800
there it was, February 1989.

19:45.967 --> 19:48.428
Unfortunately, it took me a while
to access it

19:48.595 --> 19:51.681
and I sort of forgot to tell you
that Claire was looking for you.

19:51.848 --> 19:54.809
- Phoebe.
- I'm sorry. But here's the best part.

19:54.976 --> 19:57.061
I called the PI firm he worked for,
lied to them,

19:57.228 --> 19:58.563
told them I was Andy's partner,

19:58.730 --> 20:01.441
and they told me what the initials
on the bracelet stand for.

20:01.649 --> 20:03.985
The T is for "Teri,"
the L is for "Lane."

20:04.193 --> 20:06.904
- Should I know the name?
- Teri Lane was a 5-year-old girl

20:07.071 --> 20:08.823
kidnapped by her father.

20:09.032 --> 20:11.367
It was the case the detective
was working on when he died.

20:11.534 --> 20:14.203
- So...
- So I think that that bracelet

20:14.370 --> 20:19.375
is proof that he found her. Maybe the
mother never got it, because he died.

20:19.542 --> 20:22.503
Which means she never
found her daughter.

20:23.129 --> 20:26.299
We can't sell that bracelet, Prue,
not until we know for sure.

20:27.550 --> 20:31.929
So how am I supposed to explain this
to Claire. What, psychic provenance?

20:32.972 --> 20:34.682
Psychic what?

20:35.808 --> 20:39.395
- Claire, hi.
- I have been looking all over

20:39.562 --> 20:43.566
for this bracelet.
What's it doing up here?

20:44.233 --> 20:47.278
- I had it cleaned.
- Fine. I'll return it downstairs.

20:47.445 --> 20:50.865
I've already got two buyers interested.

20:53.868 --> 20:56.328
We cannot let her sell
that bracelet, Prue.

21:04.712 --> 21:06.672
Piper.

21:11.927 --> 21:13.887
- Are you the manager?
- Yes.

21:14.054 --> 21:16.807
Laurence Beck, Health Department.

21:16.974 --> 21:20.686
This is a code inspection.
I'd like to start with the kitchen.

21:22.771 --> 21:27.359
The counters are scrubbed every
15 minutes. The dishes are washed

21:27.526 --> 21:33.198
at 150 degrees Fahrenheit
with antibacterial dergent... Detergent.

21:33.407 --> 21:38.203
- Are you ill?
- No. No, I just... I don't know.

21:38.579 --> 21:42.207
Feel free to have a look around. We
have nothing to hide here at Quake.

21:42.416 --> 21:44.042
Thanks.

22:00.976 --> 22:03.061
Excuse me, what are you doing
with that meat?

22:03.645 --> 22:05.731
Dying.

22:08.942 --> 22:12.779
Oh, right. Chuck that.

22:13.530 --> 22:17.868
You're obviously sick. I think you'd
better go home, miss,

22:18.034 --> 22:20.912
before I shut this restaurant down.

22:36.886 --> 22:39.472
- Andy.
- What happened?

22:39.639 --> 22:42.100
I don't know. I came here to meet him
and found him there.

22:42.267 --> 22:44.060
- How did he die?
- Coroner hasn't said,

22:44.227 --> 22:47.230
but it's definitely a homicide.
Although, there's no mutilation,

22:47.397 --> 22:49.649
no other visible wounds.
Doesn't fit our MO.

22:49.816 --> 22:52.485
I suppose it could be random.

22:52.652 --> 22:57.240
Chases off a crazed killer last night,
then succumbs to a mugging today?

22:57.782 --> 22:59.867
I don't buy it.

23:00.034 --> 23:02.537
Maybe the creature, or whatever it is,

23:02.704 --> 23:05.248
found out Billy had
some information on it.

23:05.415 --> 23:08.501
Got to him before he could get to me.

23:09.168 --> 23:12.880
He had been stalking him for
two months. Could be the killer knew.

23:13.047 --> 23:16.342
Still, if these are ritual murders
as you suggest,

23:16.509 --> 23:22.348
all the steps have to be followed or
the killer doesn't get his happy feeling.

23:22.515 --> 23:24.517
So why is the heart still intact?

23:24.725 --> 23:28.354
Two possibilities.
He's not AB negative,

23:28.646 --> 23:32.149
or it was trying to protect itself
from being found out.

23:32.692 --> 23:35.611
I'd go with that theory, personally.

23:36.153 --> 23:37.530
Me too.

23:37.697 --> 23:40.950
Let's go talk to Piper, see if he told her
what he wanted to tell you.

23:41.158 --> 23:43.953
You read my mind, inspector.

23:46.998 --> 23:51.335
And I have $400 now.
450. 450. 500. 550.

23:51.502 --> 23:56.006
600. 650. That's 650. $700 now.
750, up front.

23:56.173 --> 23:59.635
That's 750 now. Say eight. $800.
The gentleman's bid at 800.

23:59.802 --> 24:02.763
Anymore at $800? Sold. $800.

24:02.930 --> 24:05.391
Number 143, for the Karastan rug.

24:06.642 --> 24:10.312
And the next item is lot 102,
a Stickley lamp. And bidding will begin

24:10.479 --> 24:16.360
at $2000. Now say 21. $2300.
2400. $2700. Now 2700.

24:16.527 --> 24:17.903
- Prue, guess what.
- Where've you been?

24:18.070 --> 24:21.240
- The auction's already started.
- I think I found the little girl, Teri Lane.

24:21.407 --> 24:25.828
- I think she's living in Oakland.
- Sold. $2900.

24:26.036 --> 24:27.913
I contacted
the detective's old secretary.

24:28.080 --> 24:29.540
She helped me piece it together.

24:29.707 --> 24:33.085
She also told me that it was
the little girl's mother who hired him,

24:33.252 --> 24:35.421
because the father had abducted Teri.

24:35.629 --> 24:38.090
And next is lot 103,
a gold charm bracelet.

24:38.298 --> 24:41.009
- Bidding will begin at $375.
- Prue, you've gotta do something.

24:41.176 --> 24:43.512
That bracelet might be the only way
to convince the mother

24:43.679 --> 24:45.597
- we know where the girl is.
- What am I to do?

24:45.764 --> 24:48.559
$375 dollars for it now. 375.

24:49.017 --> 24:50.727
$375.

24:50.936 --> 24:57.192
375. Anyone at $375?
$375. Anyone at 375?

24:58.110 --> 25:01.697
At $375 now. Anyone at 375?

25:01.905 --> 25:04.866
- Anyone at $375?
- Go, girl.

25:06.618 --> 25:08.954
Very well, $300 then.
Anyone at 300?

25:13.083 --> 25:17.420
Three hundred dollars then.
Last call at 300. Anyone at $300?

25:17.629 --> 25:21.258
Very well, we'll move on to lot 104,
the pewter flagon.

25:21.466 --> 25:24.678
- Thank you, thank you.
- You just better be right.

25:24.844 --> 25:28.431
At $150 now. 150. 175.

25:37.023 --> 25:38.650
- Hi, Andy.
- Hi.

25:38.817 --> 25:41.569
- What are you doing here?
- Wanted to see how you're feeling.

25:41.736 --> 25:43.697
I feel great.

25:43.863 --> 25:46.783
Hey, where's your bandage?
How did your wound heal?

26:11.224 --> 26:12.976
- Who is it?
- It's Andy.

26:13.685 --> 26:16.688
- Andy. Go away!
- Sorry?

26:19.691 --> 26:23.194
- You can't come in. I've got the flu.
- It's okay. I had a flu shot.

26:23.361 --> 26:25.822
I gotta talk to you. It's about Billy.

26:26.406 --> 26:29.492
- He's been killed.
- What?

26:30.993 --> 26:34.121
That's not possible. He should've
been safe, it's not even night.

26:34.288 --> 26:36.165
It might not have been whoever
attacked you.

26:36.541 --> 26:40.211
- Who else could it have been?
- Sorry, had to make a call.

26:42.004 --> 26:46.133
- Are you okay?
- No, I don't feel so well.

26:46.842 --> 26:48.469
Maybe we should come back later.

26:48.636 --> 26:51.013
Just a few questions,
if you don't mind.

26:51.222 --> 26:56.227
We were wondering if you knew what
exactly Billy was coming to tell me.

26:56.811 --> 26:59.105
Just that the creature is called
a Wendigo.

26:59.271 --> 27:01.524
And that it attacks during
the full moon.

27:01.941 --> 27:03.400
Yeah, we know that.

27:03.901 --> 27:08.322
He also said that it looks like
a normal person during the day.

27:09.156 --> 27:13.744
Really? That's new. Did he have
any idea who it might be?

27:14.870 --> 27:18.541
- I don't think so.
- Too bad.

27:19.124 --> 27:21.252
How's the arm?

27:22.086 --> 27:24.338
It's fine. Well, it hurts like hell.

27:24.546 --> 27:26.256
May I?

27:28.008 --> 27:30.678
You're the only one to survive
one of these attacks.

27:30.844 --> 27:33.722
Hope you didn't get infected by it.

27:36.517 --> 27:42.106
If you think of anything,
anything at all, call me directly.

27:49.196 --> 27:51.365
Try and get some sleep.

27:51.532 --> 27:53.534
I will. Thanks.

28:34.699 --> 28:36.284
Yes?

28:36.451 --> 28:39.287
- Are you Harriet Lane?
- Who are you?

28:39.496 --> 28:42.248
We've never met.
I work at an auction house.

28:42.457 --> 28:45.210
Actually, I just started today.
My sister got me the job.

28:45.418 --> 28:49.255
Well, anyway, I sort of
found something,

28:49.422 --> 28:52.592
and I was wondering if you
might recognise it.

29:03.436 --> 29:06.397
- I've never seen it before.
- Are you sure?

29:08.566 --> 29:14.614
Hi. I don't mean to intrude, and I know
that this must be hard for you,

29:14.781 --> 29:17.492
but I know that you recognise
this bracelet.

29:18.326 --> 29:20.203
It was your daughter's, wasn't it?

29:20.411 --> 29:22.997
Why are you asking me all these
questions?

29:23.164 --> 29:24.540
Why are you doing this to me?

29:25.375 --> 29:28.586
Your daughter, what's her name?

29:28.961 --> 29:30.671
Teri.

29:31.714 --> 29:32.882
Teri Lane.

29:34.550 --> 29:36.552
Do you know where she is?

29:42.767 --> 29:44.936
Teri?

29:46.354 --> 29:48.689
Oh, my goodness.

29:50.816 --> 29:54.445
- Teri. Teri, my baby.
- Mama.

29:54.612 --> 29:56.864
Oh, Teri, Teri, Teri.

29:58.282 --> 29:59.992
I never thought I'd see you again.

30:02.995 --> 30:06.624
- It's okay, mama. I'm home now.
- Let me look at you.

30:09.627 --> 30:12.671
I guess that bracelet was worth more
than I thought it was.

30:12.838 --> 30:15.466
Are you kidding? It's priceless.

30:15.633 --> 30:18.719
Thank God for my powers.

30:19.720 --> 30:23.098
It wasn't just your powers
that did that, Pheebs.

30:29.104 --> 30:31.023
Hello?

30:32.191 --> 30:34.151
Piper, you sound terrible.
What's wrong?

30:35.194 --> 30:39.698
Sure hope Piper's gonna be okay.
She didn't look very well.

30:39.865 --> 30:41.867
I know.

30:42.493 --> 30:45.913
Both Piper and the first victim were
attacked at the far end of those trees.

30:46.121 --> 30:49.082
Must have hidden in that stretch
of woods, waited to attack.

30:49.249 --> 30:51.502
Want to get a closer look?

30:51.752 --> 30:54.254
Absolutely.

30:54.463 --> 30:56.215
You better turn your cell phone off too.

30:56.381 --> 30:59.092
Wouldn't want it to ring
and scare it away.

30:59.259 --> 31:02.721
This is a nice spot.
How did you find this place?

31:02.888 --> 31:05.807
You and Piper's sister
spend some time here?

31:05.974 --> 31:08.894
No, Prue runs more to the highbrow.

31:09.061 --> 31:11.271
Her loss.

31:11.855 --> 31:13.982
I take it you're not married.

31:14.149 --> 31:17.152
Do you see a ring on my finger?

31:17.319 --> 31:22.282
I was engaged once.
He was my world.

31:22.449 --> 31:25.660
Totally my world.

31:26.203 --> 31:29.247
Then one day, boom,
the empty dresser.

31:29.414 --> 31:32.334
The one-word note, "Sorry."

31:32.501 --> 31:36.254
I started falling. I kept falling.

31:36.421 --> 31:38.757
- Yeah, I know how that is.
- No, you don't.

31:41.801 --> 31:43.970
But I took steps.

31:44.137 --> 31:46.556
I did what I needed to make
myself strong.

31:47.641 --> 31:51.728
To make it so no one could ever
hurt me like that again.

31:52.979 --> 31:55.106
Love to know how you do that.

31:57.525 --> 31:59.027
Maybe I'll show you,

31:59.694 --> 32:01.780
if you're lucky.

32:01.988 --> 32:05.450
But now my life's a lot less
complicated.

32:05.617 --> 32:07.452
All I'm interested in is sex.

32:10.330 --> 32:11.789
Does that shock you?

32:12.790 --> 32:14.709
No.

32:14.876 --> 32:17.921
Just wondering where you were
when I was in college, that's all.

32:27.096 --> 32:29.265
Piper?

32:34.604 --> 32:36.564
Piper.

32:36.898 --> 32:38.274
I'm miserable.

32:38.649 --> 32:43.863
- It's okay, honey. It's okay.
- No. No, it's not.

32:45.448 --> 32:47.200
Prue.

32:48.743 --> 32:50.995
- Okay, can you get up?
- Back off!

32:51.537 --> 32:54.040
What do you think, I can't walk now?

32:55.249 --> 33:00.880
- Honey, we're just trying to help you.
- Help me? You can't even hold a job.

33:01.714 --> 33:04.300
- Okay, now wait a minute, Piper.
- Oh, save it.

33:04.467 --> 33:06.385
Do you always have to be in charge?

33:11.098 --> 33:13.476
I'm so sorry.

33:14.185 --> 33:15.853
What's happening to me?

33:17.521 --> 33:21.025
It's all right. Okay, we're gonna
take care of you.

33:32.828 --> 33:34.663
- What?
- What?

33:34.830 --> 33:39.293
I just saw who the Wendigo is.
Agent Fallon.

33:40.127 --> 33:42.963
- Her? I thought it had to be a him.
- I guess not.

33:43.130 --> 33:47.926
And even worse, I saw her and Andy
at the park at night. Alone.

33:48.135 --> 33:51.680
Okay, I'm gonna call him
and warn him. You go upstairs

33:51.847 --> 33:54.558
<i>to the Book of Shadows and see
if you can find a way to help Piper.</i>

33:55.100 --> 33:57.060
Okay.

34:01.106 --> 34:04.610
Nothing. This is just the same crap
I've already seen.

34:04.776 --> 34:06.987
I tried Andy's cell phone, no answer.

34:07.195 --> 34:09.656
We can't find anything about reversing
the Wendigo thing.

34:09.864 --> 34:12.701
Well, there's got to be something.

34:14.703 --> 34:18.165
Oh, didn't you check this at the bottom
of the page? "c.f. Desiderata."

34:18.331 --> 34:20.417
Yeah, like we're supposed to know
what that means.

34:20.583 --> 34:22.710
Well, it means
"conferred desiderata."

34:22.878 --> 34:25.922
It's Latin for "look up things
that are yearned for."

34:26.130 --> 34:28.175
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You're so very smart.

34:28.382 --> 34:31.136
- Piper.
- Don't Piper me. Just shut up!

34:31.636 --> 34:35.891
No. You are going to listen to me.
This is not you.

34:36.056 --> 34:39.101
All right, it's the blood of the Wendigo,
and you have to fight it.

34:42.063 --> 34:43.857
It's so strong.

34:44.065 --> 34:45.567
You're stronger.

34:45.734 --> 34:47.485
Fight it, Piper.

34:48.902 --> 34:50.905
I'm okay.

34:52.489 --> 34:54.199
All right.

34:54.909 --> 34:57.579
"Things that are yearned for...

34:57.787 --> 35:02.625
Wisdom, balance, unbecoming."

35:02.792 --> 35:05.253
That's got to be it.

35:07.046 --> 35:09.924
All right, unbecoming a Wendigo.

35:11.509 --> 35:16.890
So we have to kill the Wendigo that
slashed you by melting its heart of ice.

35:17.098 --> 35:19.392
- What if you can't find her?
- We'll find her.

35:19.601 --> 35:21.394
She's gonna be in the park tonight.

35:21.603 --> 35:24.522
But what if you're wrong? What if
you don't? Then you'll have to...

35:24.689 --> 35:28.151
- Then you'll have to kill me.
- Don't be ridiculous. We won't kill you.

35:28.359 --> 35:30.403
We're gonna kill the thing
that did this to you.

35:30.570 --> 35:34.532
But we might have to confine you
until we get back.

35:34.699 --> 35:38.327
- So tie you down, I guess.
- No! Go to hell!

35:39.120 --> 35:40.705
Do we have any chains?

35:40.872 --> 35:44.459
- I actually do think I have something.
- Okay.

35:46.669 --> 35:50.173
- Are you back?
- I don't want this to happen to me.

35:50.339 --> 35:54.218
Kill Ashley. This is me talking.

35:54.802 --> 35:56.262
Okay.

35:56.470 --> 35:58.639
Here.

35:59.307 --> 36:01.642
Where did you get the...?

36:02.184 --> 36:04.186
- Never mind.
- Let's just do this.

36:04.353 --> 36:06.564
All right. Over here.

36:09.066 --> 36:11.277
We still need to take a trip
to the Army Navy Store.

36:11.444 --> 36:14.071
- Why?
- To get a flare gun.

36:14.238 --> 36:16.615
Screw you, bitch!

36:16.782 --> 36:22.204
- Okay, I think we need to hurry.
- Yeah, just hang in there, Piper.

36:28.252 --> 36:30.337
What's the matter?

36:31.172 --> 36:34.008
I was just thinking how
I'm probably not the best cop

36:34.174 --> 36:39.930
to be on this stakeout with,
seeing as how I'm AB negative.

36:40.472 --> 36:42.641
Don't worry.

36:43.100 --> 36:45.769
I'll protect you.

37:35.986 --> 37:40.824
- Andy, doing okay?
- Little on edge.

37:50.917 --> 37:52.502
Instinct of the hunt.

37:53.795 --> 37:58.091
That's why you're here.
That's why you're a cop.

37:58.466 --> 38:00.552
Does this turn you on or something,
Agent Fallon?

38:00.719 --> 38:02.929
Or something.

38:03.680 --> 38:07.767
Look, you're a gorgeous woman,

38:07.934 --> 38:10.729
but we're on this job together.
Let's just leave it at that.

38:10.895 --> 38:13.148
Let's not.

38:39.465 --> 38:41.467
If the moon is over there,
we should go that way.

38:41.634 --> 38:43.386
- I don't see Andy's car.
- We'll find him.

38:43.553 --> 38:45.263
All right, let's hurry.

38:52.937 --> 38:54.856
Andy?

38:58.359 --> 39:00.570
Andy!

39:01.195 --> 39:04.240
This is definitely the place,
I recognise it from my premonition.

39:08.286 --> 39:09.996
Oh, God.

39:17.128 --> 39:19.213
Okay, give me another one.

39:21.549 --> 39:23.926
If that didn't get Andy to come out,
he's dead already.

39:24.093 --> 39:27.430
He's dead when we find a body,
not before.

39:39.567 --> 39:41.610
- Okay, how many more do we have?
- Two.

39:41.777 --> 39:45.322
- Two?
- That's all they had.

39:47.074 --> 39:48.409
Wait.

39:49.326 --> 39:50.661
I think that's him.

39:54.957 --> 39:59.712
Oh, God. All right, he's alive,
but she slashed him.

39:59.920 --> 40:03.132
- He still has his heart?
- We must have driven her off in time.

40:15.352 --> 40:17.563
Last one. My turn.

40:17.729 --> 40:21.400
This time we don't fire until I see
slobber on its face.

40:22.943 --> 40:24.778
Okay. It's over there.

40:25.237 --> 40:27.656
No, wait. I think it's over here.

40:27.864 --> 40:29.950
No, no, no, it's right here.

40:31.660 --> 40:34.246
Wait, how can it be in two places
at once?

40:34.413 --> 40:36.248
It can't. One of them is Piper.

40:37.666 --> 40:39.543
- Shoot.
- I can't, Prue.

40:39.709 --> 40:42.003
Just shoot and pray you hit
the right one.

40:48.343 --> 40:51.429
Wait, Piper froze it.

40:51.638 --> 40:53.014
Do something. Do it!

41:33.513 --> 41:35.765
- Are you okay?
- I think so,

41:35.932 --> 41:38.059
but I'm naked and freezing.

41:41.688 --> 41:43.773
Andy.

41:47.527 --> 41:50.363
- Are you okay?
- What happened?

41:50.863 --> 41:54.534
Prue, what are you doing here?
Where's the Wendigo?

41:54.742 --> 41:59.288
She's gone. Easy. Lie back down.
Just lie back down.

41:59.455 --> 42:03.084
It's all right. I'll explain everything later.

42:13.511 --> 42:16.013
On the house, for saving my hide.

42:16.180 --> 42:18.933
Literally, you Wendigo, you.

42:19.100 --> 42:21.227
Yeah, are you okay to work?

42:21.394 --> 42:24.605
Yeah, I'm fine. It's like nothing
ever happened.

42:24.772 --> 42:26.190
Except for Billy.

42:26.357 --> 42:28.943
There was no way that you could've
known about Agent Fallon.

42:29.151 --> 42:33.405
I know. It's just I'm not used to losing
an innocent we're supposed to protect.

42:33.614 --> 42:36.158
He wanted to help stop her
so she couldn't hurt anybody else.

42:36.325 --> 42:37.868
And that's exactly what he did.

42:38.536 --> 42:40.496
I'm just grateful that you're safe.

42:40.663 --> 42:42.498
And Andy.

42:42.665 --> 42:45.793
By the way, what did you tell him
about why we were all there?

42:46.001 --> 42:48.629
- I told him the truth.
- Get out.

42:48.837 --> 42:52.049
I did. I said that what he saw
happened was true.

42:52.216 --> 42:54.760
That Agent Fallon really was
the Wendigo.

42:54.969 --> 42:56.762
And that had we not vanquished her,

42:56.929 --> 42:59.348
that both he and Piper
would've been killed.

42:59.515 --> 43:01.642
I couldn't think of anything else to say.

43:02.142 --> 43:03.644
Well, what did he say?

43:03.852 --> 43:06.438
Not much. He was either
too stunned to speak,

43:06.605 --> 43:10.359
or he actually believed me
on some level.

43:10.526 --> 43:13.987
It was the closest that we've ever come
to having an honest conversation.

43:14.196 --> 43:17.282
So maybe Andy's more open to
your being a witch than you think.

43:18.867 --> 43:20.327
All right, back to work?

43:20.869 --> 43:25.749
Actually, I need to talk to you about
something. And please don't be mad,

43:25.916 --> 43:27.751
- but I quit.
- What?

43:28.794 --> 43:32.255
It's not that I don't appreciate
the opportunity, because I do.

43:32.422 --> 43:35.967
It's just that every time I touch
something at Buckland's,

43:36.134 --> 43:40.097
I risk having a premonition,
and it's just too emotional for me.

43:40.806 --> 43:45.811
Besides, that's your world.
I need to find one of my own.

43:46.269 --> 43:47.813
You will.

43:48.772 --> 43:51.525
Just stay out of my world,
or I'll kill you.

43:57.822 --> 44:00.492
Just kidding. It's a joke.
