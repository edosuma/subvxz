And why would they say that?

03:10.123 --> 03:12.859
My head isn't that big,
right Case?

03:12.859 --> 03:17.364
Uh, well, I--you know what?

03:17.364 --> 03:20.467
Let's just focus
on all the positive comments.

03:20.467 --> 03:23.303
I've dealt with my fair
share of haters and the key

03:23.303 --> 03:25.238
is to not let it bother you.

03:25.238 --> 03:27.340
For example,
last week when Eduardo

03:27.340 --> 03:29.342
made fun of my scrunchie,
you know what I did?

03:29.342 --> 03:30.744
Punched him
and got detention?

03:30.744 --> 03:32.312
- Regrettably yes.
- I saw that.

03:32.312 --> 03:34.581
But, do you know
what I did the second time

03:34.581 --> 03:35.816
he made fun of it?

03:35.816 --> 03:37.417
I said, "So?"

03:37.417 --> 03:40.754
and "You are entitled
to your opinion."

03:40.754 --> 03:43.523
and "Thank you for noticing
my bomb scrunchie".

03:43.523 --> 03:45.692
Then I shrugged it off,
like this.

03:47.661 --> 03:51.331
Oh, the shoulders,
you movin' the shoulders.

03:51.331 --> 03:54.401
All right, Case.
I see you. You know what?

03:54.401 --> 03:57.204
There's no way
I'm gonna let one dumb

03:57.204 --> 03:59.740
little comment bother me.

04:21.661 --> 04:24.531
Okay, I might be bothered.

04:36.576 --> 04:38.211
Oh! Hi, baby! Perfect.

04:38.211 --> 04:39.846
Now you can run
the camera for me.

04:39.846 --> 04:41.314
Okay, look,

04:41.314 --> 04:43.150
well, let me break it down.

04:43.150 --> 04:45.952
Well, some clown who goes
by Syphon8tr thinks my--

04:45.952 --> 04:50.090
I mean Moon Girl's head is big
which we both know isn't true,

04:50.090 --> 04:51.558
right Devil?

04:51.558 --> 04:52.959
So, I'm making a video

04:52.959 --> 04:54.661
that scientifically proves
my head

04:54.661 --> 04:56.329
is perfectly normal sized.

04:56.329 --> 04:58.331
I got the stats,
charts, and X-rays!

04:58.331 --> 05:00.267
And now I just need
a cameraperson--

05:00.267 --> 05:03.637
or dino-camera-saur?

05:04.938 --> 05:06.106
Well, I know
you're sleepy

05:06.106 --> 05:08.108
but come on honey!

05:08.108 --> 05:10.110
Help your girl out, please?

05:10.110 --> 05:11.778
We'll play fetch
at the park after school?

05:11.778 --> 05:16.082
Three, two, one.

05:16.082 --> 05:18.185
What's up Moon Girl fans!

05:18.185 --> 05:21.154
I wanna clear up any
misinformation asserting that I,

05:21.154 --> 05:24.524
Moon Girl, have a quote,
unquote "large" head.

05:24.524 --> 05:26.593
Now, this is a graph

05:26.593 --> 05:28.495
of head sizes
amongst young teens

05:28.495 --> 05:31.064
and my cranial measurement
has steadily increased.

05:31.064 --> 05:33.900
Clearly within normal range!

05:33.900 --> 05:36.102
So, in conclusion,
you can rest assured

05:36.102 --> 05:37.838
that your favorite
neighborhood hero

05:37.838 --> 05:42.008
may have a big brain
but does not have a big head.

05:42.008 --> 05:43.376
And cut!

05:43.376 --> 05:45.278
What'd you think?

05:45.278 --> 05:46.913
Maybe I should do it again,
but with more graphs.

05:46.913 --> 05:48.848
Really? Are you sure?

05:52.419 --> 05:53.954
Don't tell it to me
if it's not true.

05:53.954 --> 05:56.022
Like Michelle Obama?

05:56.022 --> 05:58.325
Okay, wow, thanks D!

06:05.031 --> 06:08.735
Oh! My video must be
gettin' all kinds of love!

06:08.735 --> 06:12.505
You posted to the Moon Girl
fan page without consulting me?

06:12.505 --> 06:14.474
- What were you thinking?
- Okay, one--

06:14.474 --> 06:16.710
Hi, Casey. And two,
what's the big deal?

06:16.710 --> 06:21.882

06:21.882 --> 06:24.818

07:40.994 --> 07:42.662

of troll for breakfast,

I blocked that guy.

10:24.357 --> 10:26.126
It's not a sword, Devil.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.927
It's an antenna.

10:27.927 --> 10:30.296
This baby right here
can triangulate the cell towers

11:06.599 --> 11:08.801
Hello?

11:08.801 --> 11:10.170
Yes, I charged

11:10.170 --> 11:11.938
my battery before we left!

11:11.938 --> 11:13.540
Maybe it's busted.

11:20.513 --> 11:23.416
My internet troll
is an actual troll?

11:23.416 --> 11:27.220
You know, for someone
with such a huge brain,

11:27.220 --> 11:29.556
it sure took you
a long time to find me.

11:29.556 --> 11:31.291
I guess bigger
isn't always better.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.726
Okay, first of all,
everybody knows

11:33.726 --> 11:35.461
the correlation between volume

11:35.461 --> 11:38.731
and a positive outcome is
relative to the given situation.

11:38.731 --> 11:41.000
- Second I--
- Second I--

11:41.000 --> 11:43.036
- I came here to--
- I came here to--

11:43.036 --> 11:44.237
- Stop that!
- Stop that!

11:44.237 --> 11:45.838
- I'm a loser!
- You're a loser!

11:46.773 --> 11:48.741
Syphonate this!

11:50.944 --> 11:52.345
How do you like that?

11:52.345 --> 11:55.048
A lot actually!
It tickles.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.583
Hey, maybe
you should try a head butt.

11:56.583 --> 11:58.818
Now that might actually
put me in a coma.

11:58.818 --> 12:01.487
Get it? 'Cause your head's like
really, really big?

12:02.822 --> 12:04.257
Stinky troll!

12:04.257 --> 12:06.359
Jerk!
Ugly fan fart.

12:06.359 --> 12:08.795
Only a momma
could love that face!

12:08.795 --> 12:10.530
Nee-neer, nee-neer, nee-nee!

12:10.530 --> 12:13.866
What's wrong fork arms?
Can't reach me?

12:20.540 --> 12:22.609
You know,
you two really do make

12:22.609 --> 12:24.244
a great team.

12:24.244 --> 12:28.281
Balloon Head Girl
and Devil Whine-a-saur.

12:32.785 --> 12:35.555
Girl, you should've left
that garlic bread alone.

12:35.555 --> 12:38.625
<i>After much deliberation,
I've sniffed out the girl</i>

12:38.625 --> 12:41.828
<i>whose smell
makes my heart swell.</i>

12:41.828 --> 12:44.797
<i>And that girl is...</i>

12:44.797 --> 12:46.532
- <i>Breaking news!</i>
- No!

12:46.532 --> 12:48.468
<i>Local heroes Moon Girl
and Devil Dinosaur</i>

12:48.468 --> 12:50.670
<i>are battling
a humongous beast!</i>

12:50.670 --> 12:54.107
<i>It appears to be a literal troll
under the Williamsburg bridge.</i>

12:54.107 --> 12:55.708
What the?

12:57.276 --> 13:00.847
Uh-oh, you almost got me!

13:04.450 --> 13:06.486
I'm gettin' tired too

13:06.486 --> 13:08.721
and this green meanie's
only getting stronger.

13:08.721 --> 13:10.323
But how?

13:10.323 --> 13:12.325
I gotta find out
what we're dealing with.

13:13.826 --> 13:15.795
An alien symbiote?

13:15.795 --> 13:19.232
Wait, symbiotes have a natural
weakness to sonic based attacks.

13:19.232 --> 13:21.801
Devil, you think you
could blast 'em with a big roar?

13:29.642 --> 13:31.044
Yeah!

13:31.044 --> 13:32.578
We got 'em.

13:32.578 --> 13:35.581
Ha! You're on fire today, D!

13:35.581 --> 13:38.084
Up top!

13:38.084 --> 13:40.353
So, you're just gonna
leave me hangin'?

13:44.257 --> 13:47.393
Oh. My. Gamma rays.

13:50.830 --> 13:53.066
That felt so good!

13:53.066 --> 13:54.334
Thank you!

13:54.334 --> 13:56.369
Don't mention it.

13:57.603 --> 14:00.273
Ooh!
Look out world!

14:00.273 --> 14:03.276
This action figure
comes with bonus features!

14:13.286 --> 14:14.854
- Devil!
- Ouch!

14:14.854 --> 14:16.989
I can't tell
which got hurt more,

14:16.989 --> 14:19.358
your body or your feelings!

14:25.898 --> 14:28.868
Beating you was way easier
than I thought it would be.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.838
Now I'll go down in history
as the one who took down

14:31.838 --> 14:36.075
Moon Head Girl
and Devil Tiny-arms.

14:36.075 --> 14:40.079
And everyone will finally see
what you really are.

14:40.079 --> 14:43.416
A big head, fuzzy haired nobody!

14:43.416 --> 14:45.451
Listen man,
if you don't stop,

14:45.451 --> 14:47.553
you're gonna destroy
the entire bridge!

14:47.553 --> 14:49.322
Hmm.

14:49.322 --> 14:53.092
Destroyer of Moon Girl
and the Williamsburg Bridge.

14:53.092 --> 14:54.694
Oh, no, no, no. Wait!
I didn't mean--

14:54.694 --> 14:56.229
That'll actually make me
even more famous!

14:56.229 --> 14:57.964
Thanks, Moon Head Girl!

14:57.964 --> 15:00.166
You actually used
that brain for something!

15:00.166 --> 15:03.035
Wiki page, here I come!

15:23.923 --> 15:26.292
How will
I ever get out of this!

15:26.292 --> 15:28.261
- Yoo-hoo?
- Oh, Casey!

15:28.261 --> 15:30.029
I'm so happy to see you!

15:30.029 --> 15:31.664
You'll never guess
what happened--

15:31.664 --> 15:33.399
Oh, yeah?
Well, let's see,

15:33.399 --> 15:35.368
was it that you went
after the internet troll

15:35.368 --> 15:38.070
specifically after you promised
not to and it turned out

15:38.070 --> 15:40.173
to be an actual giant troll
who's destroying

15:40.173 --> 15:42.141
the bridge
and now I have to wait

15:42.141 --> 15:44.243
until next week's rerun
to find out who Marcus chose?

15:44.243 --> 15:45.645
Did I miss anything?

15:47.046 --> 15:48.581
I had Beans N' Weenies
for lunch?

15:48.581 --> 15:50.716
You are lucky the world
needs saving right now!

15:50.716 --> 15:53.186
Speaking of which,
why are you covered in boogers?

15:53.186 --> 15:55.087
It's not booger!

15:55.087 --> 15:57.390
I ran an analysis
on this goop and it looks like

15:57.390 --> 16:00.059
it can be broken down
by an acetate compound.

16:00.059 --> 16:02.562
But, acetate?
Well, like nail polish remover?

16:02.562 --> 16:05.598
Well, yeah,
I guess but who carries--

16:05.598 --> 16:09.135
I got light duty,
medium strength, acrylic power,

16:09.135 --> 16:11.103
and this stuff right here
can melts concrete.

16:11.103 --> 16:13.039
It is not good for your nails.

16:13.039 --> 16:15.107
Oh, Casey! Did I mention
you're my favorite person?

16:15.107 --> 16:16.876
I'm my favorite person too.

16:21.647 --> 16:23.983
What's a guy gotta do
to make a bridge collapse?

16:25.418 --> 16:26.552
Bingo!

16:31.724 --> 16:33.326
Booger King
over there is tugging

16:33.326 --> 16:34.694
on the bridge string thingy!

16:34.694 --> 16:36.128
The suspension cables?

16:36.128 --> 16:37.830
Well, those are fracture
critical pieces!

16:37.830 --> 16:39.365
<i>Habla ingles, chica!</i>

16:39.365 --> 16:41.267
If any one
of the cables break,

16:41.267 --> 16:43.202
the entire bridge
will fall apart!

16:43.202 --> 16:44.904
What?
No, no, no.

16:44.904 --> 16:47.506
I can't die,
before Love Scent's finale!

16:47.506 --> 16:49.642
- You gotta stop him!
- Yeah, but how?

16:49.642 --> 16:52.879
It doesn't matter what I say
or do, he just gets stronger!

16:52.879 --> 16:54.714
Whoa!

16:54.714 --> 16:56.782
I told you not to feed
that troll in the first place.

16:56.782 --> 16:59.118
Feed!
That's it!

16:59.118 --> 17:01.020

20:22.188 --> 20:25.491
I guess I just wanted you
to feel small like I did.

20:25.491 --> 20:27.860
But I didn't mean
for it to go this far.

20:27.860 --> 20:29.495
It just spiraled out of control.

20:29.495 --> 20:31.430
I never even thought
I could hurt your feelings.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.310

I'm really sorry, Moon Girl.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.913
Can we ever be cool?

20:47.913 --> 20:51.050
Okay, but only
if you promise me

20:51.050 --> 20:53.519
to never ever do
anything like this again.

20:53.519 --> 20:57.256
And take a big break from
the internet 'cause you need it!

20:57.256 --> 21:01.393
And maybe tell us
what editing software you use.

21:01.393 --> 21:03.562

21:03.562 --> 21:05.231

maybe we can team it up one day.

21:08.934 --> 21:10.970
Me?
Work with Moon Girl?

21:10.970 --> 21:13.072
