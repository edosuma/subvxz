WEBVTT

01:27.721 --> 01:29.894
You okay?
That was a close one.

01:30.057 --> 01:32.230
Yeah, but it worked.

01:32.392 --> 01:34.429
Good news is,
we only needed one of them.

01:34.595 --> 01:38.065
Get him to the cryo-lab for testing.
Next time, you can be the bait.

01:39.399 --> 01:41.379
One vector.

01:41.802 --> 01:44.408
One vector. We've hardly seen any
since Peter was taken.

01:44.705 --> 01:45.740
Where'd they all go?

01:46.807 --> 01:50.152
I must insist
you return upstairs.

01:50.310 --> 01:51.880
This exercise is too dangerous.

01:52.045 --> 01:55.117
On the contrary, Level R seems...

01:55.282 --> 01:56.625
almost abandoned.

01:56.783 --> 01:59.593
Any idea how 50 vectors just...

02:00.754 --> 02:02.631
disappear?

02:09.963 --> 02:11.340
He came from in here, right?

02:11.932 --> 02:13.468
Yeah.

02:17.270 --> 02:18.790
We're on the bottom level of the base?

02:19.239 --> 02:20.274
Yes.

02:20.440 --> 02:22.442
Then why is there air
coming up from below?

02:23.410 --> 02:25.822
This isn't the bottom level, is it?
What's down there?

02:27.247 --> 02:28.453
Tell them everything,

02:28.782 --> 02:29.852
or I will.

02:30.083 --> 02:31.619
Tell me what?

02:37.791 --> 02:38.826
Level X.

02:38.992 --> 02:41.302
Level X. There's a...?

02:41.461 --> 02:43.304
What is on Level X?

02:43.463 --> 02:44.806
The virus vault.

02:45.198 --> 02:47.474
It's where we keep
all our original core samples.

02:47.634 --> 02:50.774
You have original samples
of Narvik?

02:50.937 --> 02:55.215
A and B strains?
Of course he does. He created them.

03:00.313 --> 03:02.350
Come with me.

03:04.184 --> 03:08.132
You engineered
an apocalypse virus?

03:08.288 --> 03:09.858
I was never going to deliver it.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.469
That doesn't matter.

03:12.826 --> 03:15.670
Ilaria wanted a virus
and a cure.

03:15.829 --> 03:19.208
I used them to create
something more beneficial.

03:19.366 --> 03:21.209
Like creating smallpox
to cure cancer?

03:21.368 --> 03:25.214
If I didn't, they would have
hired another lab,

03:25.372 --> 03:27.716
one that might have
given them the virus.

03:27.874 --> 03:28.909
Without me,

03:29.076 --> 03:31.682
you'd be dealing
with a billion bodies by now.

03:31.845 --> 03:34.223
No, you don't get to play the hero.

03:34.381 --> 03:37.726
What you've done
is unconscionable.

03:37.884 --> 03:40.922
- Sutton was a much greater evil.
- Was?

03:41.688 --> 03:43.031
What happened to her exactly?

03:44.057 --> 03:46.867
She is no longer a problem.

03:47.360 --> 03:50.204
What's coming next
is far worse than Sutton.

03:50.530 --> 03:53.670
What do you mean?
Sutton was just a messenger.

03:53.834 --> 03:58.010
Next, they will send an army.

03:58.171 --> 04:02.745
They will not stop
until they have the virus.

04:15.622 --> 04:18.625
Then we need to get down there
and destroy the virus

04:18.791 --> 04:21.398
before ilaria get their hands on it.

04:21.560 --> 04:23.063
Show them.

04:34.641 --> 04:36.712
Just give me a
second to pull up the image.

04:36.877 --> 04:37.912
Sure, where is it?

04:38.078 --> 04:40.991
You have a lot of explaining to do.
I'm sorry.

04:41.148 --> 04:43.219
I was trying to protect you.

04:43.416 --> 04:44.952
- You goddamn drugged me.
- Go right ahead.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.256
Yeah, here we go.

04:47.954 --> 04:49.262
Tell me about the picture.

04:49.422 --> 04:52.995
The one of us. I couldn't have been
more than 6 years old.

04:53.760 --> 04:55.171
This place is massive.

04:55.328 --> 04:56.932
This is the main problem.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.134
We have met before,

05:02.102 --> 05:04.673
when you were a child.
Then you knew my mother?

05:04.838 --> 05:09.184
Of course.
She was extremely talented.

05:10.610 --> 05:13.819
A top-notch cellular biologist.
And yet you asked me about her,

05:13.980 --> 05:15.823
pretending you'd never heard of her.

05:15.982 --> 05:20.294
Your mother was one
of the finest scientists I ever met.

05:20.687 --> 05:22.792
A great mentor.

05:23.290 --> 05:26.203
She was also a dear friend.

05:26.593 --> 05:30.131
I visited her several times
in Montana.

05:30.297 --> 05:32.174
That's when that photo was taken.

05:33.133 --> 05:35.545
How is that photo even possible?
It was 30 years ago.

05:35.702 --> 05:37.978
You look exa...
I was a very young man.

05:38.138 --> 05:40.345
So it's just a coincidence
that I'm here,

05:40.807 --> 05:43.048
at your base,
all these years later?

05:43.210 --> 05:47.124
Coincidence, karma, fate.

05:47.447 --> 05:49.051
Call it what you wish.

06:19.012 --> 06:20.889
You still here?

06:21.181 --> 06:23.092
Why didn't the old lady
let you go?

06:23.250 --> 06:24.923
Seems she had different plans.

06:25.752 --> 06:29.222
Too bad she won't be here to see
the shitstorm crash down on this place.

06:30.357 --> 06:34.032
In two days,
ilaria's gonna drop in, full force.

06:34.194 --> 06:35.537
Yeah?

06:35.695 --> 06:37.834
Hope we're here to see it.

06:38.331 --> 06:39.605
Shouldn't be a problem.

06:39.766 --> 06:42.042
Aren't you supposed to be
a Houdini with locks?

06:42.369 --> 06:44.110
Most locks.

06:44.271 --> 06:47.946
They added an electromagnetic seal
after I got out last time.

06:49.509 --> 06:50.886
Meaning what?

06:51.044 --> 06:55.390
I can get the door unlocked,
but I can't get it to move, genius.

07:02.355 --> 07:04.357
Level X was here
long before we were.

07:04.524 --> 07:07.061
- It'll be here long after we're gone.
- What was it?

07:07.294 --> 07:10.969
Remains of an abandoned
Russian trading post from the 1850s.

07:11.131 --> 07:13.907
- I'll pull up the security cameras.
- Oh, my God.

07:14.067 --> 07:17.276
At least now we know
where all the vectors went.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.576
They are attracted to heat.

07:19.739 --> 07:22.652
The vault has
its own power supply.

07:22.809 --> 07:24.914
Is the vault secure?
Solid as a rock.

07:25.078 --> 07:28.423
So how do we get down there to destroy
what's left of the Narvik samples?

07:28.581 --> 07:31.960
There is a secure staircase.

07:32.719 --> 07:33.789
I will go down.

07:34.721 --> 07:35.961
Like hell you will.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.999
I don't trust you
anywhere near that virus.

07:38.158 --> 07:41.105
And how do you plan
to get past the vectors?

07:41.261 --> 07:43.764
We already know the halothane
gas doesn't work on them.

07:44.097 --> 07:46.737
I don't know yet.

07:46.933 --> 07:48.469
Guys, take a look at this.

07:50.437 --> 07:52.940
- What are they doing?
- It's swarm behavior.

07:53.106 --> 07:55.518
Like bees in a hive,
they're all drawn to something.

07:56.076 --> 07:57.612
Or someone.

09:01.007 --> 09:02.987
Don't know what you're trying
to accomplish. We got better results

09:03.143 --> 09:05.384
with the Racal suits.
You have Racal suits

09:05.545 --> 09:09.322
for every vector on this base?
Yeah, good point.

09:09.482 --> 09:12.861
Ready for the cold stuff?
Yeah.

09:19.559 --> 09:20.867
Look at that.

09:21.027 --> 09:23.234
CFC gas.
Puts them in a state of paralysis.

09:24.030 --> 09:27.204
That ought to do the trick
for the vectors downstairs.

09:28.668 --> 09:30.545
Yeah, there's just one problem.

09:30.703 --> 09:32.876
I don't have enough gas
to hit the whole floor.

09:33.039 --> 09:35.110
I won't be needing the gas.

09:35.275 --> 09:38.722
How are you gonna get the temperature down?
You gotta hit minus 40

09:38.878 --> 09:40.551
to see any results.

09:40.713 --> 09:42.386
It's minus 50 outside.

09:44.784 --> 09:47.788
Sure. So, what, they're gonna
follow you right out?

09:47.954 --> 09:51.197
Hey, that'd be a hell of a snowball fight.
I'm bringing the outside to them.

09:57.063 --> 10:00.442
Why don't you just bang your head
against it? Probably just as effective.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.238
Better that
than getting murdered.

10:02.402 --> 10:05.246
I don't think Hatake works that way.
Huh?

10:05.405 --> 10:09.080
He's hyper efficient. Killing us
causes more problems than it solves.

10:10.276 --> 10:11.311
At least for now.

10:11.478 --> 10:13.788
Then we have a chance.
If we can hold out

10:13.947 --> 10:17.417
until ilaria blows this place.
They don't know we're down here.

10:17.584 --> 10:19.120
If they blow up the base,

10:19.285 --> 10:20.764
we're locked inside.

10:20.920 --> 10:24.424
We gotta let them know, man. Maybe
we can light a signal fire or something.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.999
Keep thinking, Klein,
because that's what you're good at.

10:28.161 --> 10:30.641
Hey, I just wanna be standing
at the end of this.

10:30.797 --> 10:33.641
Not like Sutton or that Inuit bitch.

10:37.770 --> 10:40.944
What about the Inuit girl?
Sutton sent a squad down to kill her

10:41.774 --> 10:44.118
and burn her whole village
to the ground.

10:44.277 --> 10:46.314
No loose ends.

10:47.847 --> 10:49.622
We'll have no
way of communicating

10:49.782 --> 10:52.285
between the mechanical room
and Level X.

10:52.452 --> 10:56.525
The walls are too thick, so everything
will have to be perfectly timed.

10:56.689 --> 10:58.430
Daniel will prep the base

10:58.591 --> 11:01.162
while Hatake and Jordan
take the power grid offline.

11:01.327 --> 11:04.672
Julia and I will make the descent
to Level X to destroy the core virus.

11:05.131 --> 11:06.804
I should go with you.
You can't.

11:06.966 --> 11:09.845
I need you to keep an eye on Hatake.
It's just flipping switches.

11:10.003 --> 11:13.974
I don't trust him with Julia.
Alan, let me go down there alone.

11:14.140 --> 11:15.175
Are you crazy?

11:15.341 --> 11:18.686
Vectors in the ducts didn't attack me.
Peter didn't attack me either.

11:18.845 --> 11:21.655
We still don't know why they do
or don't do anything.

11:21.814 --> 11:23.384
Shit.

11:23.950 --> 11:26.487
You all right over there?
Uh, yeah.

11:26.653 --> 11:27.825
My zipper's just caught.

11:33.726 --> 11:36.502
Take this. Just in case.

11:38.064 --> 11:39.509
She won't need it,

11:39.666 --> 11:40.701
you will.

11:51.077 --> 11:52.181
Step one,

11:52.345 --> 11:55.519
Hatake and Jordan familiarize
themselves with the power grid.

11:55.682 --> 11:58.390
<i>Make sure the boilers and the forced air
system are turned off in sequence.</i>

11:58.585 --> 11:59.655
One.

11:59.852 --> 12:01.195
Two.

12:01.888 --> 12:04.164
Three.
This is three.

12:04.324 --> 12:07.203
That's four.
Sorry.

12:08.194 --> 12:10.196
Three, four.

12:10.363 --> 12:11.933
Then...

12:12.198 --> 12:13.575
<i>It has to be perfectly timed.</i>

12:13.733 --> 12:16.680
If the power's still on
when Julia and I get to Level X,

12:16.836 --> 12:19.578
the vectors will still be active,
and we don't want that.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.878
<i>Step two,
Daniel and his security team</i>

12:22.041 --> 12:25.614
<i>will distribute thermal blankets
to</i> as <i>many uninfected as possible.</i>

12:25.778 --> 12:28.452
<i>Now, it's 28 minutes maximum.</i>

12:28.615 --> 12:32.028
Should be survivable, but after that,
hypothermia will start to set in,

12:32.185 --> 12:33.926
and we'll start losing people.

12:34.120 --> 12:36.600
Survival blanket. Ha, ha.
You wanna feel real cold?

12:36.756 --> 12:39.362
You should try working here
for a while.

12:40.360 --> 12:41.805
Oh, what, no takers?

12:42.228 --> 12:45.471
How about a pay check?
Haven't had one of those in a while.

12:45.632 --> 12:49.705
<i>Step three, Julia and I will
descend Hatake's private staircase</i>

12:49.869 --> 12:51.974
at exactly 0200.
Mark.

12:54.207 --> 12:55.777
<i>- Access granted.</i>
<i>- At the same time,</i>

12:55.942 --> 12:57.819
<i>you and Sarah tum off
the power grid.</i>

12:57.977 --> 13:00.890
We flood the base
with all that outside air,

13:01.047 --> 13:02.754
and freeze the vectors in place.

13:03.149 --> 13:04.219
Now.

13:06.452 --> 13:07.954
Now.

13:08.254 --> 13:09.790
Go ahead.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.336
One.
Two.

13:12.492 --> 13:14.267
Three, four.

13:24.837 --> 13:27.579
<i>The blowers stop,
the pressure will change,</i>

13:27.740 --> 13:30.118
<i>then the hot air will rise up and out</i>

13:30.276 --> 13:33.120
as the cold air sinks down
to the bottom of the base.

13:41.621 --> 13:44.659
Hiroshi, I'm gonna die soon,

13:45.191 --> 13:47.762
and nothing I did will ever matter.

13:49.195 --> 13:50.868
L...

13:52.632 --> 13:55.010
I accomplished nothing.

13:55.601 --> 13:57.706
I left nothing behind.

13:57.870 --> 14:00.714
It will be like
I never even existed.

14:00.873 --> 14:02.716
Dr. Jordan?

14:04.310 --> 14:06.654
Can you hear me?
And I worked so hard

14:06.813 --> 14:08.486
but it doesn't matter.

14:09.282 --> 14:10.317
Can you hear me?

14:19.792 --> 14:22.568
How do you think we'll
know if your plan worked?

14:22.729 --> 14:28.736
If we're not attacked and
infected when we get to this Level X,

14:28.901 --> 14:30.244
then it worked.

14:30.670 --> 14:33.674
<i>Emergency
power active. Emergency power active.</i>

14:33.840 --> 14:36.184
What the hell, man?
Are they here already?

14:36.342 --> 14:37.412
No, it's too soon.

14:37.577 --> 14:39.523
What do you think it is?

14:46.018 --> 14:47.929
Opportunity.

14:50.857 --> 14:53.064
Thought you couldn't break
the electromagnetic thingy.

14:53.226 --> 14:56.173
Not with the power on, Einstein.

14:58.097 --> 15:01.510
<i>We'll have 28 minutes
tops to destroy the core virus</i>

15:01.667 --> 15:03.507
<i>and get back upstairs
before the heat comes on.</i>

15:03.569 --> 15:05.242
Cold.

15:05.872 --> 15:07.715
It'll get worse.

15:07.874 --> 15:08.944
Keep moving.

15:09.108 --> 15:11.452
Alan, if this doesn't work...

15:11.611 --> 15:13.420
If this doesn't work,

15:13.579 --> 15:17.117
we burn the base to the ground
with everyone in it.

15:17.283 --> 15:20.230
Everyone? Even Peter?

15:20.520 --> 15:21.555
Even Peter.

15:21.721 --> 15:24.634
But if we destroy the base,
how do we get home?

15:27.960 --> 15:29.530
We don't.

16:04.897 --> 16:05.932
Jesus.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.178
Eighteen minutes.

16:10.336 --> 16:12.009
Keep moving.

16:54.146 --> 16:56.285
<i>Access granted.</i>

17:18.671 --> 17:19.911
Oh, my God.

17:23.675 --> 17:25.678
There are too many.

17:30.850 --> 17:33.091
"Ebola-Zaire,

17:33.252 --> 17:35.596
Ebola-Reston.

17:36.689 --> 17:39.363
Rift Valley fever." What the...?

17:39.525 --> 17:42.165
"Marburg, Lassa,

17:45.264 --> 17:47.210
Spanish flu."

17:48.267 --> 17:51.407
They've got more strains here
than we do at the CDC.

17:53.539 --> 17:55.382
Wait, don't put them back.

17:55.541 --> 17:57.748
We don't have time.
We have to find the Narvik.

17:57.910 --> 18:00.720
We have 11 minutes, all right?
That's less time than we need.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.621
You wanna leave all these
for ilaria?

18:23.970 --> 18:26.917
We should go upstairs, hunker
down and wait for reinforcements.

18:27.073 --> 18:30.452
I'll take my chances outside.
It's suicide out there.

18:31.077 --> 18:32.920
I have to.
I'm not leaving the base.

18:33.379 --> 18:34.483
No, you're not.

18:45.625 --> 18:48.071
Have you ever seen death?

18:49.228 --> 18:51.265
Ever stared it right in the face?

18:52.598 --> 18:54.635
Do you know what that's like?

18:54.800 --> 18:55.835
No.

18:56.002 --> 18:59.142
I thought it would be a dark
and empty hole.

18:59.572 --> 19:00.607
But it's not.

19:01.907 --> 19:06.788
It's as bright as day and it's filled with
all the things you never did in your life.

19:06.946 --> 19:11.827
Dr. Jordan, we are almost
at hypothermia limit.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.964
Please, it's almost time.

19:14.120 --> 19:16.293
I'll never cure the incurable.

19:16.956 --> 19:20.199
I'll never crack an RNA code,

19:21.193 --> 19:23.139
I'll never win the Seaborg.

19:26.432 --> 19:28.469
And I'll never have children.

19:33.472 --> 19:34.974
Doctor?

19:42.982 --> 19:44.552
Dr. Jordan?

19:54.460 --> 19:56.906
Son of a bitch.

20:04.870 --> 20:06.850
<i>“Yersinia pestis."</i>

20:07.006 --> 20:08.679
This is the Black Death.

20:08.841 --> 20:11.048
"Plague of Justinian."

20:11.343 --> 20:12.378
"Cocoliztli."

20:12.745 --> 20:13.849
"Sweating sickness."

20:14.046 --> 20:17.027
It's like a who's who
of mass epidemics in here.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.924
Narvik.

20:20.186 --> 20:22.029
It's gone.

20:22.188 --> 20:24.327
Someone got here before us.
Maybe it was misplaced.

20:25.758 --> 20:27.101
We're out of time.
Not yet.

20:27.259 --> 20:28.704
Jules, we don't have time.

20:28.861 --> 20:31.671
- Wait, wait.
- Jules.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.736
Okay.

20:37.036 --> 20:39.038
No, no. We don't have time.
Wait, please.

20:39.705 --> 20:41.582
They're waking up!

20:52.218 --> 20:54.425
Aw, shit!

20:59.358 --> 21:00.928
If you shoot me,

21:01.093 --> 21:03.232
you kill your sister
and your brother.

21:11.871 --> 21:12.906
Tell me.

21:13.706 --> 21:16.482
Sutton sent a squad to track down
Anana and burn the village.

21:16.642 --> 21:18.451
Bullshit. We
rounded up all her men.

21:18.944 --> 21:19.979
Apparently not.

21:21.714 --> 21:23.921
It's the truth. Believe me.

21:24.750 --> 21:25.785
Why do you care?

21:30.422 --> 21:32.834
Because at some point,
it just has to stop.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.996
Now, you can shoot me,

21:36.162 --> 21:38.164
but I'm still going.

21:40.900 --> 21:41.935
No, you're not.

21:46.305 --> 21:47.340
We're going.

22:05.691 --> 22:08.297
Keep going, don't stop.
Don't worry about me.

22:29.548 --> 22:31.494
Wait.
Come on!

22:31.884 --> 22:33.864
Alan, those are my initials.

22:34.019 --> 22:37.330
We don't have time!
Alan, those are my initials. I did that.

22:43.295 --> 22:46.504
How?
I don't know, but I'm here for a reason,

22:46.665 --> 22:48.838
and I have to go down there.

22:52.004 --> 22:53.347
Are you sure about this?

22:53.839 --> 22:57.048
I was a little girl, 6 or 7, but my
mother brought me to this place.

22:57.209 --> 22:59.155
She knew Hatake.
Why didn't you tell me?

22:59.311 --> 23:02.815
I thought I was hallucinating from the
virus, but it was a repressed memory.

23:02.982 --> 23:04.893
Something I didn't wanna know,
until now.

23:05.050 --> 23:06.927
Jules, that door will not hold forever.

23:07.086 --> 23:09.692
If we go down there,
we may not come back up.

23:09.855 --> 23:12.233
I'm not asking you to come with me.

23:13.192 --> 23:15.194
I'm not asking your permission.

23:36.916 --> 23:39.897
This is it. This is why I'm here.

23:40.719 --> 23:42.426
You're sure?

23:45.858 --> 23:46.893
Oh, my God.

23:49.561 --> 23:51.404
Jules, what is this place?
Where are we?

23:52.731 --> 23:53.732
Home.

24:04.743 --> 24:05.778
What's wrong?

24:05.945 --> 24:08.289
The trail's gone.

24:11.417 --> 24:13.829
I thought you were supposed to
be good at tracking.

24:13.986 --> 24:17.798
Our people can't track anything
through the blowing snow in the night.

24:17.957 --> 24:20.494
Our people are also really good
at not being followed.

24:22.394 --> 24:24.101
Anana.
You two make more noise

24:24.263 --> 24:25.469
than a rutting caribou.

24:25.898 --> 24:28.936
My snowmobile threw a track.
I saw your lights about 2 miles back.

24:29.101 --> 24:31.775
Thought you were part of ilaria.
That's why we're here.

24:31.937 --> 24:33.610
Sutton sent
a death squad after you.

24:34.506 --> 24:37.453
A group came by about three hours ago.
How many?

24:37.609 --> 24:40.419
Three snowmobiles, five riders.
They on their way to the village?

24:40.579 --> 24:42.684
As far as we know,
with orders to terminate.

24:44.450 --> 24:45.952
We need to go, now.

24:49.755 --> 24:51.632
You told me you
spent summers in Montana.

24:51.790 --> 24:54.532
I did. Apparently also here.

24:54.827 --> 24:57.967
But why would Hatake build
an exact replica of my mother's cabin?

24:58.130 --> 25:00.804
Seems like something
you'd have told me by the third date.

25:00.966 --> 25:02.946
It looks exactly the same.

25:03.435 --> 25:04.880
How?

25:05.104 --> 25:06.481
The question is, why?

25:06.772 --> 25:08.809
Why bring a 6-year-old girl here?

25:08.974 --> 25:12.615
Why build a fake cabin
to make her think it was home?

25:12.778 --> 25:13.813
I don't know.

25:13.979 --> 25:15.981
What do you remember
about your mother?

25:16.148 --> 25:17.650
Hardly anything.
She died when I was young.

25:17.816 --> 25:20.820
Well, think, Jules.
There must be something.

25:22.688 --> 25:23.996
Peter said something to me.

25:24.790 --> 25:28.169
Peter spoke to you?
When I was hallucinating, he said:

25:28.460 --> 25:31.339
"It's about you, Julia.
It's always been about you."

25:32.197 --> 25:35.007
Might have been
your subconscious talking.

25:36.201 --> 25:39.205
Or it might be the reason
we're all here.

25:39.371 --> 25:40.577
We have to go.

25:54.219 --> 25:57.029
About 15 civilians
being loaded into a trailer.

25:57.689 --> 26:00.898
Why would they do that?
My guess is they're gonna set it on fire.

26:02.027 --> 26:03.529
Less to clean up that way.

26:05.898 --> 26:08.242
Easy.
I'm not gonna let them burn to death.

26:08.400 --> 26:11.506
Neither am I.
We just can't go strolling in there.

26:11.670 --> 26:14.207
You gotta think like a soldier.
He's right.

26:14.373 --> 26:16.853
We're outnumbered and outgunned.

26:18.343 --> 26:20.380
Can you get us close?

26:20.712 --> 26:21.747
Oh, yeah.

26:21.914 --> 26:25.225
- Come on, keep moving.
- Keep going!

26:26.351 --> 26:27.386
Go on! Go on!

26:27.553 --> 26:28.588
Let's go! Get in!

26:29.388 --> 26:31.390
Hey, you missed one!

26:33.959 --> 26:36.599
Caught her around the perimeter
about to snipe your ass.

26:36.762 --> 26:38.400
We checked. We didn't see anyone.

26:38.564 --> 26:40.566
- Sir.
- We didn't see anyone, sir.

26:44.403 --> 26:46.280
Miksa?

26:46.572 --> 26:48.916
Hey, that's one of them.
He works for me.

26:53.912 --> 26:55.585
Stay down!

26:56.915 --> 26:58.087
Please, Tulok. Stay down!

27:02.254 --> 27:03.426
I'm with him.

27:04.089 --> 27:05.966
I don't know any stupid Eskimos.

27:17.436 --> 27:20.315
Alan, I'm sorry
I never told you.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.782
Alan's not here,

27:22.941 --> 27:24.852
but you're going to be okay.

27:25.010 --> 27:27.286
The surgery didn't work.

27:28.447 --> 27:31.121
It was too close
to the spinal cord.

27:32.117 --> 27:34.028
Grade 4 metastatic.

28:04.550 --> 28:06.655
As soon as we get back
to Hatake's office,

28:06.818 --> 28:07.853
I'm gonna find out...

28:25.871 --> 28:27.714
Stay back, Peter.

28:36.148 --> 28:37.684
Get right behind me. Stay close.

28:37.849 --> 28:39.692
What are you doing?
Trust me on this.

28:51.930 --> 28:53.102
Go upstairs. Go.
Jules...

28:53.265 --> 28:54.903
I'll hold them back.

29:10.182 --> 29:11.388
Go ahead, finish him.

29:12.351 --> 29:13.955
Wait a minute.

29:15.554 --> 29:16.624
Let him do it.

29:35.374 --> 29:38.116
Sir, our orders are
no headshots,

29:38.277 --> 29:41.121
in case the skulls are dug up
after we burn them.

29:41.747 --> 29:43.055
Oh.

29:43.248 --> 29:44.818
You mean like this?

30:01.767 --> 30:03.940
How did you do that?
I don't know, I just did.

30:04.102 --> 30:06.742
But how did you know?
Ever since my recovery,

30:06.905 --> 30:09.476
I've felt different.

30:09.641 --> 30:12.121
I mean, my eyes changed,
but that's not all.

30:12.277 --> 30:15.952
I don't know how to explain, but the
vectors seem to have lost interest in me.

30:16.114 --> 30:19.789
More like they were afraid of you.
Maybe they were.

30:19.951 --> 30:22.488
I have so many questions.

30:22.654 --> 30:24.327
We both know who has the answers.

30:30.262 --> 30:31.297
Brother.

30:32.864 --> 30:34.673
Brother.

30:38.970 --> 30:41.007
Don't ever call me Eskimo again.

30:44.309 --> 30:45.652
Level B.

30:45.811 --> 30:47.381
Sarah. What happened?

30:47.546 --> 30:48.854
I should be asking you.

30:49.014 --> 30:52.689
How could you not know she
had a grade 4 spinal tumor?

30:53.018 --> 30:54.827
A spinal tumor?

30:54.986 --> 30:56.056
Is she symptomatic?

30:56.221 --> 30:59.031
She suffered a seizure
about 20 minutes ago.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.337
Her pulse is weak, thready.

31:01.493 --> 31:03.370
Get her into the ICU
as soon as possible.

31:03.528 --> 31:06.065
We can hook her into
the life support we used on Peter.

31:06.231 --> 31:08.575
So where is the core virus?

31:08.734 --> 31:11.044
Gone or never there.

31:11.670 --> 31:13.411
That's impossible.

31:13.572 --> 31:14.915
Given the last nine days,

31:15.073 --> 31:17.917
you may wanna remove
that word from your vocabulary.

31:27.185 --> 31:29.358
How did you not know?
You didn't know, right?

31:29.521 --> 31:31.262
Maybe I didn't wanna know.

31:31.423 --> 31:33.562
I saw all the signs,
the tremors, the morphine.

31:33.725 --> 31:34.897
You can't blame yourself.

31:35.060 --> 31:38.598
Except if I had known,
I would have done the same thing.

31:38.764 --> 31:41.074
I needed her on the job
more than I needed her healthy.

31:41.233 --> 31:44.544
Shes really good, Alan.
She has the spark.

31:44.703 --> 31:46.046
We have the spark.

31:46.204 --> 31:48.741
- Sarah?
- Alan, wait for me.

31:48.907 --> 31:51.444
Wait for me until I finish my training.

31:51.610 --> 31:53.715
Sarah, just relax.
Try to sleep, all right?

31:53.912 --> 31:56.119
Mm. Sleep with me again, Alan.

31:57.582 --> 31:59.892
Maybe you should, uh...
Maybe I'll get her stabilized.

32:00.051 --> 32:02.554
Of course.
And then, you can...

32:03.388 --> 32:04.924
Jules.

32:05.090 --> 32:08.264
It's fine. We're divorced,
remember?

32:20.272 --> 32:22.411
You knew my mother.

32:22.908 --> 32:26.082
You built a replica
of my childhood cabin.

32:27.279 --> 32:29.919
None of this is coincidence.

32:30.081 --> 32:31.082
Who the hell are you?

32:54.272 --> 32:56.684
This was one of
the happiest days of my life.

33:00.245 --> 33:02.521
Me, you...

33:09.621 --> 33:10.656
and your mother.

33:22.267 --> 33:23.302
That's Jaye.

33:26.438 --> 33:29.351
But my mother's name was...
Jane.

33:29.508 --> 33:33.012
Or to a 4-year-old, Jaye.

33:43.188 --> 33:49.002
I've waited for this day longer
than you could possibly know.

33:50.495 --> 33:53.669
I was afraid.
Of what?

33:54.900 --> 33:56.072
Rejection.

34:00.872 --> 34:04.251
I wanted you to know me,

34:05.911 --> 34:08.221
but it was never the right time.

34:09.547 --> 34:10.856
What are you saying?

34:12.851 --> 34:16.230
The cabin is not a replica.

34:16.922 --> 34:18.025
<i>That's not possible.</i>

34:18.188 --> 34:21.068
You never lived in Montana.
No, that's not possible.

34:21.359 --> 34:23.339
Who are you?

34:39.844 --> 34:40.879
You have...

34:42.280 --> 34:44.282
your father's eyes.

35:30.128 --> 35:33.007
Did we ever play
with those little cars?

35:33.164 --> 35:34.768
Hot Wheels.

35:35.266 --> 35:36.301
All the time.

35:36.468 --> 35:41.110
Was there a white one
with the doors that opened-l?

35:41.272 --> 35:42.774
Like wings? Yeah.

35:43.174 --> 35:45.518
Up, not out.

35:45.910 --> 35:47.355
Heh. Like wings.

35:47.746 --> 35:49.123
That was my favorite.

35:50.081 --> 35:51.321
You punched me for it once.

35:57.088 --> 35:58.123
Yes, I did.

36:00.592 --> 36:02.128
Even?

36:10.201 --> 36:12.977
We need to talk about
what's coming next. ilaria will...

36:19.010 --> 36:21.490
You idiot. Sit.
We don't have any time.

36:21.646 --> 36:24.320
You can't save the world
if you're bleeding to death.

36:27.719 --> 36:30.723
This is why women
will always be the stronger sex.

36:31.289 --> 36:33.326
We know when to sit.

36:44.202 --> 36:48.582
<i>♪ All around me are familiar faces ♪</i>
