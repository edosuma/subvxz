01:02.560 --> 01:03.607
Give me that!

01:18.120 --> 01:19.804
Move!

01:20.360 --> 01:23.762
Hey, sir! Sir! Come back!

01:56.400 --> 01:57.925
I've gotta get outta here.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.684
Boo, boo, boo, hey, hey, hey.

01:59.800 --> 02:01.643
Girl, you got that list of questions?

02:01.720 --> 02:02.846
Yes.

02:02.920 --> 02:05.810
I think I have everything that I need.

02:05.880 --> 02:07.609
Be happy you ain't got
this chlamydia, all right?

02:07.840 --> 02:09.967
Ooh, girl, I tried to take a piss earlier,

02:10.039 --> 02:12.168
it was like there was an angry
dragon inside my snatch,

02:12.360 --> 02:14.124
you know, like some Game of Thrones shit!

02:14.200 --> 02:16.362
That's terrible, Kateesha.

02:16.440 --> 02:19.125
I can't help it when
a tall, athletic brother

02:19.240 --> 02:21.561
come pushing up on this thickness.

02:21.640 --> 02:23.449
Ooh, yeah... Oh, shit!

02:23.720 --> 02:28.089
Oh, God, girl, I thank God
every motherfucking day

02:28.160 --> 02:30.766
that the SuperSonics
moved to Oklahoma. Shit.

02:31.320 --> 02:36.929
Okay, I'm gonna go so I won't
be late for your interview.

02:37.160 --> 02:38.571
What the fuck are you wearing, girl?

02:38.880 --> 02:43.329
There ain't no camouflage,
no fishnets and no fluorescent colors.

02:43.400 --> 02:46.324
How they gonna see you in the dark,
bitch? How they gonna see you?

02:46.720 --> 02:48.245
I gotta go.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.764
Wow, so big.

03:33.960 --> 03:35.450
Oh, I'm sorry.

03:35.520 --> 03:38.205
If you're looking for the homeless
shelter, it's two doors down.

03:38.320 --> 03:40.243
Oh, no, I'm... I'm Hannah Steale.

03:40.320 --> 03:42.527
I'm here to see Mr. Black.

03:43.440 --> 03:46.762
The college bitch. May I take your coat?

03:46.840 --> 03:49.286
Yes, please. Thank you.

03:50.040 --> 03:51.565
Ew...

03:53.440 --> 03:54.680
Follow me.

03:57.600 --> 03:58.806
In case you're wondering,

03:58.880 --> 04:00.848
I'm the hot secretary
who's fucking the boss,

04:00.920 --> 04:02.843
which means there's no room
for the dopey intern

04:02.920 --> 04:05.287
with the damaged hair and the cankles.

04:07.960 --> 04:09.086
Come here.

04:09.160 --> 04:11.242
Ugh!

04:12.320 --> 04:13.651
That's the smell of his balls

04:13.720 --> 04:15.688
after lunch and two games of racquetball.

04:15.760 --> 04:17.683
Mmm...

04:18.560 --> 04:20.289
Have a nice day, Ms. Steale.

04:20.360 --> 04:21.850
Plain-ass bitch.

04:40.520 --> 04:43.046
Ow! My neck. Ow. Ooh.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.047
You...

04:51.400 --> 04:53.084
Oh, shit!

05:00.560 --> 05:02.528
I guess I should've tried pulling.

05:02.640 --> 05:03.687
Ms. Kavahellnah.

05:03.760 --> 05:04.841
Christian Black.

05:05.920 --> 05:07.046
Are you okay?

05:07.160 --> 05:09.288
I think so, yeah.

05:09.400 --> 05:11.528
Good, 'cause you got fucked up!

05:13.080 --> 05:15.606
I mean, you hit that statue
like a hard-charging rhino,

05:15.680 --> 05:17.489
and I say rhino because
you're a lot fatter than I thought,

05:17.560 --> 05:20.608
and you got this bump on your nose
that resembles a small horn.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.490
- Maybe you wanna get that squeezed.
- Okay.

05:22.560 --> 05:24.085
A little Proactiv on it.

05:24.360 --> 05:25.930
I'm not Ms. Kavahellnah.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.490
You ain't Ms. Kavahellnah?

05:27.560 --> 05:30.404
- Who the fuck are you?
- My name is Hannah Steale.

05:30.480 --> 05:31.970
I'm studying literature

05:32.040 --> 05:33.929
with Kateesha at the university.

05:34.400 --> 05:35.401
Oh.

05:35.520 --> 05:38.205
Please, have a seat.

05:38.280 --> 05:39.770
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

05:55.840 --> 05:56.841
No.

05:59.160 --> 06:01.401
- No.
- So, what do you want?

06:01.480 --> 06:03.608
Jesus Christ! Just spit it out!

06:04.280 --> 06:05.850
A pencil.

06:05.920 --> 06:08.969
A pencil... You should've just
said that in the beginning!

06:09.040 --> 06:11.441
Gosh! Here, take 'em!

06:11.960 --> 06:13.962
- Jesus!
- Thank you.

06:14.200 --> 06:16.089
You gotta get your shit together,
Ms. Steale.

06:18.080 --> 06:19.525
Shit.

06:19.600 --> 06:22.251
These are Kateesha's questions, okay?

06:24.840 --> 06:27.320
"You have mad stacks of cash.

06:28.120 --> 06:30.600
"How'd you get it, and can I get some?"

06:30.760 --> 06:33.366
Oh... Ms. Steale.

06:33.480 --> 06:34.561
I got my money

06:34.640 --> 06:36.847
the way most black
entrepreneurs got theirs.

06:37.360 --> 06:39.408
- Real estate?
- Drug dealing.

06:39.680 --> 06:43.048
See, you have to know
your business inside and out.

06:43.760 --> 06:46.206
I smoked crack. Not for long,

06:46.880 --> 06:49.008
but just long enough to know
what a penis tastes like.

06:50.360 --> 06:52.488
Tastes like raw rump roast.

06:52.560 --> 06:54.210
- Mmm.
- Ew!

06:54.280 --> 06:57.648
I got all ashy, like E.T.
when he was sick in the river.

06:58.360 --> 07:01.170
I lost six essential teeth.

07:01.840 --> 07:05.128
Have you ever tried to eat steak
with one molar?

07:05.200 --> 07:07.521
No. Why would I do that?

07:08.000 --> 07:10.128
Gnaw and suck.

07:10.240 --> 07:13.244
Gnaw and suck. It's hard.

07:13.720 --> 07:17.486
- Could be that you're lucky.
- No.

07:17.880 --> 07:19.803
Keanu Reeves is lucky.

07:20.120 --> 07:22.566
Flo Rida is lucky.

07:22.720 --> 07:24.927
Iggy Azalea is lucky.

07:25.080 --> 07:26.923
Yeah, he's lucky.

07:27.040 --> 07:28.201
Next question.

07:29.040 --> 07:33.329
"Is you gay, or is you gay as
a motherfucker?"

07:33.720 --> 07:37.645
Just because you touch a penis
doesn't mean you're gay.

07:37.720 --> 07:40.246
Especially if it's for money or crack.

07:40.720 --> 07:44.406
You're only gay if you
enjoy touching penis.

07:44.880 --> 07:47.201
You touch a penis with attitude, like...
"I don't really like this."

07:47.320 --> 07:50.369
That ain't gay. It's just exploratory.

07:51.480 --> 07:53.323
You said you're an English major.

07:53.400 --> 07:55.721
Was it Chaucer, Shelley or Keats

07:55.800 --> 07:57.882
that first made you fall in love
with literature?

07:58.240 --> 08:00.322
- It was Seuss.
- Seuss!

08:00.480 --> 08:03.051
- Cat in the Hat, Thing 1 and Thing 2.
- ...and Thing 2!

08:03.120 --> 08:05.202
I mean, who doesn't wanna be them?

08:05.280 --> 08:07.328
Well, you know, me and my
brother were Thing 1

08:07.400 --> 08:08.925
and Thing 2 for Halloween this year.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.002
- Really?
- Yeah. Check this out.

08:12.280 --> 08:14.169
Oh, my God, look at both of you!

08:14.240 --> 08:16.288
We called 'em Thang 1 and Thang 2.

08:18.480 --> 08:19.845
That's amazing.

08:19.920 --> 08:21.524
What if I wanted to hire you?

08:21.920 --> 08:25.891
I don't know. I see the way
the women dress around here.

08:25.960 --> 08:28.691
I don't exactly fit in.

08:28.760 --> 08:30.762
You know, despite the
Salvation Army sweater,

08:30.840 --> 08:32.330
the greasy weaves,

08:32.440 --> 08:34.408
and your big ol' Usher nose,

08:34.480 --> 08:36.926
there's something
oddly attractive about you.

08:37.320 --> 08:39.163
Yeah, you're like the little ugly runt

08:39.240 --> 08:40.969
in a litter full of pretty puppies.

08:41.120 --> 08:43.282
You know, the little ugly one
that nobody wants to touch.

08:43.360 --> 08:46.807
You're, all hairless and big-eyed
and wild-looking.

08:47.040 --> 08:49.691
But you just wanna take you home
and give you love,

08:49.760 --> 08:51.762
or stuff you in a sack
with a bunch of rocks

08:51.840 --> 08:54.401
and just toss your little ugly ass
at the bottom of the ocean.

08:54.480 --> 08:55.766
Just put you out your misery.

08:56.400 --> 08:58.448
Oh. Okay.

09:01.440 --> 09:02.726
Thank you, Mr. Black.

09:02.800 --> 09:05.007
Please, call me Christian.

09:06.480 --> 09:09.051
- Christian.
- I hope I answered all your questions.

09:09.120 --> 09:11.202
You certainly did.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.483
- Hannah.
- Christian.

09:15.560 --> 09:16.971
Ooh, shit!

09:17.040 --> 09:18.530
Oh, God!

09:19.120 --> 09:20.281
Oh!

09:20.480 --> 09:22.084
Jesus Christ!

09:22.160 --> 09:23.844
Oh, God, make it stop!

09:27.920 --> 09:30.571
White girls, get that elevator fixed.

09:32.480 --> 09:34.005
Ooh, Hannah!

09:34.320 --> 09:36.561
So, how was he?

09:36.960 --> 09:40.123
He was all right, I guess.

09:40.200 --> 09:43.886
Oh, shit! You fucked him, girl!
I knew that shit!

09:44.000 --> 09:46.685
Yeah, girl, get that dick,
girl, get that dick.

09:46.760 --> 09:49.889
What? Uh! Get that dick! Yeah, yeah, yeah!

09:50.000 --> 09:52.685
Take it to town, motherfucker.
Get that dick.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.808
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

09:54.880 --> 09:56.962
Shit, girl, yeah! Ooh!

09:57.040 --> 09:58.610
So, did he have a big dick?

09:58.680 --> 10:01.445
- What?
- Ooh, girl, was it like real skinny, girl,

10:01.520 --> 10:03.443
or was it like real long,
like skinny long?

10:03.520 --> 10:04.726
'Cause that's fucking weird.

10:04.840 --> 10:06.683
But, like, short and thick, girl?

10:06.760 --> 10:08.285
I can get down with that short, fat dick.

10:08.360 --> 10:11.011
No, there is... There's no...
There's no dick.

10:11.080 --> 10:12.764
Remember what I told you, okay?

10:12.880 --> 10:16.123
If it's got like little red zit-like
things on the head of that shit,

10:16.200 --> 10:17.964
you put that in your butt, okay?

10:18.040 --> 10:21.522
He gonna be like,
"Oh, girl, no, it's just skin tags."

10:21.640 --> 10:23.881
"Bitch, you got 47 skin tags on your dick?

10:23.960 --> 10:25.041
"I ain't falling for that shit.

10:25.120 --> 10:27.043
"Again!" Okay?

10:27.160 --> 10:31.722
Mmm, but you gotta admit,
girl, he is bangin'! Mmm!

10:32.040 --> 10:34.930
Yeah, I guess if you're
into the wildly-successful,

10:35.040 --> 10:37.407
super-handsome, possibly-dangerous thing,

10:37.480 --> 10:39.369
then Christian Black is your guy.

10:39.440 --> 10:42.410
Bitch, I'm talkin' 'bout Lil Weezy!

10:42.480 --> 10:45.051
Ooh, girl, he got tats on his tats.

10:45.120 --> 10:47.282
And he ain't afraid
to get a bitch pregnant.

10:47.360 --> 10:49.089
Let you keep the baby and everythin'.

10:49.320 --> 10:50.321
Mmm.

10:50.960 --> 10:52.246
You gonna eat that?

10:54.200 --> 10:58.922
Ooh, I wish I could find a man
the size of this to satisfy me.

10:59.040 --> 11:01.611
This shit better be gluten-free.

11:35.040 --> 11:37.611
Hmm, Mr. Black.

11:37.800 --> 11:39.290
Oh, God.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.929
Mmm... God, Christian.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.001
Mmm...

11:52.480 --> 11:54.130
Oh, my God, you know what I wanna do.

12:18.040 --> 12:19.644
- Hi.
- What the fuck?

12:20.000 --> 12:21.650
What a pleasant surprise, Ms. Steale.

12:22.280 --> 12:24.009
Please, call me Hannah.

12:24.080 --> 12:25.127
Okay, Ms. Steale.

12:26.200 --> 12:28.680
I was just in the area
and wanted to pick up a few items.

12:29.200 --> 12:31.521
Are you stalking me, Mr. Black?

12:33.040 --> 12:34.087
Yes.

12:35.520 --> 12:37.602
I mean, unless you don't want me to.

12:37.680 --> 12:40.650
You do want me to, don't you?

12:42.440 --> 12:43.885
Just something to think about.

12:44.840 --> 12:47.286
Can I help you with something?

12:47.360 --> 12:48.441
Yes.

12:48.520 --> 12:50.761
I would like to pick up
some cable ties and some tape.

12:51.080 --> 12:53.128
Well, you're in luck,
we got some cable ties right here.

12:53.240 --> 12:55.288
- What color do you want?
- Red.

12:56.600 --> 12:58.523
The color of passion.

12:59.200 --> 13:00.964
The tape is this way. Follow me.

13:05.960 --> 13:07.644
If I didn't know better,

13:07.720 --> 13:09.722
I might mistake you for a serial killer.

13:11.120 --> 13:12.645
Don't be ridiculous.
If I was a serial killer,

13:12.720 --> 13:14.722
I'd need rope, ax, lye, ammonia,

13:14.800 --> 13:16.723
chlorophyll, wood chipper, plastic sheets

13:16.800 --> 13:18.723
and three large boxes of space Pampers.

13:19.280 --> 13:20.406
And a shovel.

13:21.560 --> 13:23.722
Second thought...

13:23.800 --> 13:25.928
I think I need to
pick up a few more items.

13:26.720 --> 13:29.166
Well, looks like you're all set now.

13:29.240 --> 13:30.765
Thank you, Ms. Steale.

13:32.480 --> 13:36.326
Hey, if your roommate needs
a photo to go with the story,

13:36.400 --> 13:38.767
I'll be around tomorrow. And the next day.

13:38.920 --> 13:39.921
And the day after that.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.968
I'm actually around all of next week.

13:42.080 --> 13:44.208
Here. Just contact me.

13:45.880 --> 13:47.325
"Christian Black.

13:48.080 --> 13:52.085
"I'm not a bidness man,
I'm a bidness... man."

13:53.320 --> 13:55.641
Thank you so much
for your help, Ms. Steale.

13:55.760 --> 13:57.888
Let me know when those space
Pampers come in, okay?

13:57.960 --> 13:59.485
Save me three boxes!

13:59.600 --> 14:00.931
Got a long drive ahead of me.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.411
Bye!

14:02.480 --> 14:04.130
I'm gonna call you.

14:10.360 --> 14:12.124
- Jesse!
- Hey.

14:12.280 --> 14:14.328
Thank you so much
for doing this last minute.

14:14.440 --> 14:17.125
Hannah, listen,
you are my best friend, okay?

14:17.200 --> 14:18.611
You know I'd do anything for you, right?

14:18.680 --> 14:19.966
Oh!

14:20.560 --> 14:22.767
- Yeah. I'd really love a handjob, though.
- What?

14:22.880 --> 14:25.531
I said I really love this job.
It's amazing.

14:25.600 --> 14:27.204
Oh, my God. Get in here.

14:27.280 --> 14:28.930
Later I wanna hit it.

14:29.120 --> 14:30.770
Uh... Um...

14:30.840 --> 14:32.490
I didn't catch the last thing.

14:32.600 --> 14:34.648
I said later I wanna hit the bar.

14:34.720 --> 14:36.006
- Oh.
- Come on, Hannah,

14:36.080 --> 14:37.730
it's what platonic friends do.

14:37.800 --> 14:39.165
You know? You grab a beer, right?

14:39.240 --> 14:40.287
Then you make out and have sex

14:40.400 --> 14:43.051
until we question the status of our
friendship or whatever, you know?

14:43.240 --> 14:45.811
- I guess. Come on.
- Yeah. Come here.

14:45.920 --> 14:47.490
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

14:47.720 --> 14:49.961
Hannah! Did you just kiss me on my lips?

14:50.040 --> 14:52.691
- Wait, I thought that...
- No. Listen. Okay, let's get one thing clear.

14:52.800 --> 14:55.724
- We are just friends. Don't make it weird.
- Oh, no, I thought...

14:55.840 --> 14:58.081
- It's okay, I'll fuck you later.
- Wait. What?

14:58.200 --> 15:00.282
I said I'll see you later.

15:00.560 --> 15:02.005
- Jeez, Hannah.
- Oh.

15:02.520 --> 15:04.170
Just go.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.325
Pow! Pow!

15:09.880 --> 15:12.087
Girl, he's staring at you like some real

15:12.160 --> 15:14.083
Fear-type shit right now, girl.

15:14.160 --> 15:15.605
He look like Marky Mark

15:15.680 --> 15:17.967
after he left the Funky Bunch
and started acting, girl.

15:18.040 --> 15:19.405
All right, give me a smile.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.001
Cheese.

15:21.080 --> 15:23.321
All right, don't ever
fucking smile again, okay?

15:23.680 --> 15:26.160
He asked me to go to coffee
with him after the shoot.

15:26.240 --> 15:27.730
Oh, girl, that's cute!

15:27.880 --> 15:29.450
Last time I went to coffee,

15:29.520 --> 15:31.682
I got eaten out outside of McDonald's.

15:31.920 --> 15:34.651
That McCafé menu got a girl gushin'.

15:34.720 --> 15:36.006
All right, let's break the Internet.

15:45.960 --> 15:47.041
Eat.

15:47.400 --> 15:49.846
I'm not your dog,
you can't tell me what to do.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.806
You're right. If you were my dog,
I would do this.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.521
Bad girl! Bad, bad, bad girl!

16:00.360 --> 16:01.566
So, tell me about your family.

16:01.680 --> 16:02.886
Well...

16:03.720 --> 16:07.088
My dad left me when I was two years old,

16:07.200 --> 16:09.885
so I was mostly raised by my stepdad, Ron.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.923
That's painfully uninteresting.

16:13.280 --> 16:14.441
How about your mother?

16:14.560 --> 16:16.688
- She's been married eight times.
- Yeah.

16:16.760 --> 16:18.649
She's an incurable romantic.

16:18.720 --> 16:20.324
Are you a romantic?

16:20.400 --> 16:21.686
I guess.

16:23.200 --> 16:24.406
I mean, I like long walks on the beach.

16:24.480 --> 16:26.050
I like baby talk, I like to cuddle.

16:26.120 --> 16:27.849
Ooh, and I love Nicholas Sparks movies.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.331
Even the one with Miley Cyrus?

16:29.400 --> 16:31.562
- That's my favorite one!
- Bitch, I'm out!

16:36.480 --> 16:38.050
- Cheers.
- Yeah.

16:40.720 --> 16:43.405
Ooh, that tastes
like a white boy on spring break.

16:43.520 --> 16:45.921
I hate him. I'm gonna call him.

16:46.040 --> 16:47.769
You want another drink?

16:47.840 --> 16:50.081
Yes. Drink to forget.

16:50.160 --> 16:51.685
Yeah.

16:52.880 --> 16:54.325
Oh, yeah.

16:56.480 --> 16:57.891
That tastes horrible.

16:57.960 --> 17:00.008
The Molly must not be
crushed up all the way.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.043
Let me fix it for you.

17:02.760 --> 17:04.125
I gotta go to the bathroom.

17:04.200 --> 17:05.440
You gotta what?

17:05.520 --> 17:07.965
I gotta go to the ladies' room.

17:08.040 --> 17:10.884
- Huh?
- I have to take a shit!

17:16.760 --> 17:19.923
Hannah... Hannah, you feeling all right?
A little woozy perhaps?

17:20.040 --> 17:22.327
- Whoa!
- Huh? Unable to make good decisions?

17:22.400 --> 17:24.726
We should take it to the next level
and you, like, suck my dick.

17:24.800 --> 17:27.521
Baby, you take it to the next level,
you stop feelin' sick, okay?

17:27.599 --> 17:30.683
Oh, my God. You are my bestest friend.

17:30.760 --> 17:32.330
Yes. With benefits.

17:33.640 --> 17:35.290
Ah... Fuck my mouth with your fingers.

17:35.520 --> 17:36.601
Fuck!

17:37.800 --> 17:39.450
I'm never gonna get none.

17:40.960 --> 17:44.487
I'll fuck you.
I ain't gonna like it, but I'll do it.

17:44.600 --> 17:46.329
Listen, I don't fuck white girls, okay?

17:46.440 --> 17:48.044
Nigga, who you callin' white?

17:50.200 --> 17:52.362
She just call me the N word?

17:53.600 --> 17:55.204
Kind of turned me on.

17:56.400 --> 17:58.323
Call me "nigga" again.

18:04.080 --> 18:06.082
Mmm-hmm.

18:12.480 --> 18:13.811
Well, hello there.

18:13.880 --> 18:15.882
Yeah, this is Hannah.

18:16.640 --> 18:17.801
Hannah, are you wasted?

18:17.880 --> 18:19.291
Yes, I am wasted.

18:19.360 --> 18:22.011
You're a hole-ass,
you're might on the roney,

18:22.120 --> 18:24.361
you penis suck of yours.

18:24.440 --> 18:28.525
You sound like Yoda. Listen,
I want you to go home right now.

18:28.600 --> 18:30.284
Don't tell me what to do,

18:30.360 --> 18:32.761
Mr. "Oh, let's go for coffee.

18:32.880 --> 18:34.803
"No, stay away from me!"

18:34.880 --> 18:37.326
Let me put this in words
you can understand.

18:37.400 --> 18:40.370
Now, right home you go!

18:40.440 --> 18:41.441
No!

18:41.880 --> 18:42.961
I told him.

18:43.720 --> 18:45.961
- Mmm-hmm.
- Bitch, you smell like shit.

18:50.160 --> 18:51.446
Ugh!

18:55.720 --> 18:58.041
Oh, Hannah! Hannah!
Hey, it's cold out here.

18:58.120 --> 18:59.201
You can't come out like that.

18:59.280 --> 19:00.725
Oh, thank you.

19:00.800 --> 19:02.086
How you feelin'?

19:02.200 --> 19:03.850
Just a little bit drunk.

19:03.920 --> 19:06.400
Are you, like, Donald-Trump-running-
for-president drunk

19:06.480 --> 19:08.687
or, like, Donald-Trump-saying-
he-don't-like-Mexicans drunk?

19:08.760 --> 19:09.966
'Cause that's some crazy shit, man.

19:10.040 --> 19:12.327
A lot of Mexicans out there
just crossing the border and shit!

19:12.400 --> 19:15.324
And you show them niggas love!
Show them niggas love!

19:15.400 --> 19:16.401
Can I show you some love?

19:16.480 --> 19:17.527
What? No!

19:17.600 --> 19:20.968
Come on. Come on! Just one kiss, man!

19:21.040 --> 19:23.042
I don't know when you gonna
be this drunk again!

19:23.120 --> 19:24.690
Come on, gimme that kiss!

19:24.760 --> 19:25.761
Ow! Stop!

19:25.840 --> 19:28.366
- Hey! Hey! She said no!
- Stop!

19:30.080 --> 19:31.241
Christian!

19:31.440 --> 19:32.726
You just push me, nigga?

19:33.120 --> 19:35.248
Oh, you got some crazy shit coming, boy.

19:35.640 --> 19:36.721
Wait. Hold up. This nigga comin' back?

19:36.800 --> 19:37.847
Comin' to you, nigga.

19:37.920 --> 19:39.524
He comin' back!

19:39.600 --> 19:41.364
Damn!

19:44.640 --> 19:46.768
Christian, stay down!

19:47.000 --> 19:48.445
Okay. Okay.

19:48.800 --> 19:51.280
The nigga's a ninja! This nigga's a ninja.

19:51.640 --> 19:53.608
Worldstar!

19:53.680 --> 19:56.604
- Bitch!
- He had such a beautiful face.

19:57.600 --> 19:59.125
Did he leave?

19:59.200 --> 20:01.043
You better run!

20:01.920 --> 20:03.285
Oh, I don't feel so good, Christian.

20:03.360 --> 20:04.407
Come on, let's get you home.

20:04.480 --> 20:06.608
Oh, no, I can't with you,

20:06.720 --> 20:09.769
because my roommate is in there.

20:10.120 --> 20:13.249
Don't worry.
She's being well taken care of.

20:13.320 --> 20:14.890
What's your name again?

20:15.040 --> 20:17.088
My name is Eli.

20:17.160 --> 20:19.731
My friends call me Weekday.

20:19.800 --> 20:21.325
I'm Christian's brother.

20:21.400 --> 20:23.050
Ooh... Mmm...

20:23.120 --> 20:25.168
The poor one.

20:25.240 --> 20:26.287
Mmm-mmm...

20:28.520 --> 20:30.249
I know what you're saying,

20:30.320 --> 20:35.167
"Oh, he's financially poor,
yet spiritually rich."

20:35.480 --> 20:36.606
Mmm...

20:36.680 --> 20:39.160
- Nah, that don't count.
- What do you feel?

20:40.520 --> 20:43.171
- What do you feel?
- Oh, my God.

20:43.240 --> 20:46.642
When does that end? Oh, my God!

20:46.840 --> 20:51.448
The weight of my penis makes
my money too heavy to carry around!

20:51.560 --> 20:52.686
Yes!

20:52.800 --> 20:54.325
I'll see you later, woman.

20:55.840 --> 20:58.525
- Until we meet again.
- How can I touch you?

20:58.600 --> 21:00.443
I mean, get in touch with you!

21:00.520 --> 21:01.931
My number

21:02.880 --> 21:04.211
is seven.

21:04.280 --> 21:05.281
Oh!

21:06.200 --> 21:09.568
That's a good number. Oh, God.

21:09.640 --> 21:11.165
I'mma call you!

21:14.480 --> 21:16.323
Good morning.

21:17.440 --> 21:18.930
I've been staring at you all night.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.206
I haven't blinked once.

21:20.800 --> 21:22.370
Gosh, my eyes are hurting.

21:25.200 --> 21:27.885
- How did I get here?
- I brought you here, Hannah.

21:29.040 --> 21:30.201
Did you undress me?

21:30.280 --> 21:31.850
I sure did. Mmm...

21:32.240 --> 21:33.571
My God, we didn't...

21:33.880 --> 21:35.928
No, we didn't.

21:36.760 --> 21:38.489
And I have the blue balls to prove it.

21:39.280 --> 21:41.089
Look at these things.

21:42.200 --> 21:43.406
Ugh!

21:43.480 --> 21:47.087
What are those? What the fuck are those?

21:47.240 --> 21:48.765
Oh... It hurts so much.

21:48.840 --> 21:50.410
I don't know what to do!

21:50.480 --> 21:51.811
Why are you showing me this?

21:52.480 --> 21:53.891
I ordered you some breakfast.

22:03.640 --> 22:07.087
Here. Eat. You'll need your strength.

22:07.320 --> 22:11.086
But you licked this one, and did
all sorts of other weird stuff to it.

22:11.160 --> 22:13.925
Can I get a fresh one? Maybe some jam.

22:14.040 --> 22:15.610
No, eat it.

22:15.760 --> 22:18.001
Why don't you just
leave me alone, Christian?

22:18.120 --> 22:20.088
Because I'm incapable
of leaving you alone.

22:20.560 --> 22:22.050
I'm a certified stalker.

22:22.120 --> 22:25.362
I have four restraining orders,
and I'm currently working on a fifth.

22:25.440 --> 22:26.965
Listen to me.

22:27.040 --> 22:29.771
I don't do the romance thing.

22:30.280 --> 22:33.602
Anal, yes. Fisting, sure.

22:33.760 --> 22:37.401
Two in the pink, one in the stink, yeah.

22:37.480 --> 22:40.450
I do that. But I don't do romance.

22:42.480 --> 22:44.084
You know, I'd like to bite that lip.

22:44.160 --> 22:45.810
I wish you would.

22:49.440 --> 22:50.441
Ow!

22:50.520 --> 22:51.681
Ow! Mmm...

22:51.760 --> 22:52.886
Oh, my God!

23:04.720 --> 23:07.530
Come on, let's get you outta here.

23:08.640 --> 23:10.961
- God, that made me wet.
- Oh!

23:11.280 --> 23:12.441
Oh, love it.

23:21.160 --> 23:23.003
Fuck the bullshit.

23:33.480 --> 23:35.323
How you doin'?

23:42.840 --> 23:44.365
Open your eyes. Lizard kisses, come on.

23:51.760 --> 23:53.000
Vampire bite!

23:57.680 --> 23:58.806
I love it! More!

23:58.880 --> 24:00.120
Yes! Yes!

24:01.240 --> 24:02.605
Oh, my God!

24:08.840 --> 24:10.604
You shut up and watch.

24:12.560 --> 24:13.891
Get outta here!

24:16.680 --> 24:18.011
Excuse me.

24:22.000 --> 24:25.049
I have to warn you,
elevators make me horny.

24:28.040 --> 24:31.010
Ooh, Daddy, I want you
to write a song about me.

24:31.320 --> 24:32.924
I wanna be your muse.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.604
Oh, this is a great time.

24:34.680 --> 24:37.206
I'm inspired to write a song

24:37.280 --> 24:38.611
about you right now.

24:38.680 --> 24:40.523
Ooh, that feels so good.

24:41.280 --> 24:45.251
'Cause I love havin' sex unprotected

24:45.360 --> 24:46.361
Ooh.

24:46.440 --> 24:50.889
And I love when my dick's in you naked

24:50.960 --> 24:52.371
Deeper, Daddy, deeper! Yeah!

24:52.480 --> 24:55.848
Goin' raw in you, you, you...

24:55.920 --> 24:57.285
Yes! Yes!

24:57.360 --> 25:00.728
Goin' raw in you, you, you, you

25:00.800 --> 25:04.202
Ooh, I think you going platinum
in about two minutes! Oh!

25:04.360 --> 25:07.284
You're infected, yeah

25:07.600 --> 25:10.365
Need antiseptic, yeah

25:10.480 --> 25:12.130
'Cause, girl, you burned it

25:12.200 --> 25:14.441
Ooh, that like an E minor or something?

25:14.520 --> 25:16.443
Oh, you burned it!

25:17.080 --> 25:18.525
Oh, you burned

25:18.760 --> 25:20.364
Ah... You...

25:24.360 --> 25:25.361
Ooh, shit.

25:25.440 --> 25:27.169
Motherfucker!

25:30.480 --> 25:33.450
You done? I gotta get to church.

25:35.040 --> 25:36.201
- Hey!
- Oh.

25:36.280 --> 25:37.441
You two are fucking.

25:39.480 --> 25:41.323
- Ooh.
- Hey, bro.

25:44.080 --> 25:45.969
- How you doin'?
- My brother.

25:46.200 --> 25:47.281
My brother, peace and blessings.

25:47.560 --> 25:49.642
Hannah, this is my little brother, Eli.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.365
- Little?
- Yes.

25:51.440 --> 25:53.761
I'm Eli, like the movie about the book,

25:53.840 --> 25:55.126
because I'm deep.

25:55.240 --> 25:56.241
He is deep.

25:56.320 --> 25:57.321
Balls deep.

25:57.400 --> 25:58.686
Yeah.

25:58.760 --> 26:00.364
Kateesha told me a lot about you.

26:00.440 --> 26:02.568
Yeah, you're like... You're, like, a lot

26:02.640 --> 26:04.483
plainer than I thought you would be.

26:04.560 --> 26:06.403
Well, she plain but pretty.

26:06.520 --> 26:09.729
- You're like a brick wall, just boring and rigid...
- Okay.

26:09.800 --> 26:12.201
And just ashy in some places.

26:12.280 --> 26:14.009
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
enough with the small talk.

26:14.640 --> 26:17.041
We have a long drive ahead of us.

26:17.160 --> 26:19.322
We do. Great pleasure.
It's been a pleasure.

26:20.160 --> 26:21.730
The moon shall rise again.

26:21.800 --> 26:24.326
Ooh, that so romantic, boo.
What that mean?

26:25.320 --> 26:29.041
- Deuces, bitch.
- Okay, I got you! I see you later!

26:29.120 --> 26:31.043
- Nice meeting you.
- Bye.

26:32.640 --> 26:36.361
All right, so listen.
Meet me at the office later.

26:36.480 --> 26:38.130
I have something special planned for you.

26:38.840 --> 26:40.524
- Okay? Deuces, bitch.
- Mmm-hmm.

26:40.600 --> 26:42.443
- Who you calling a bitch?
- Oh, shit!

26:42.680 --> 26:43.727
Damn, girl.

26:43.800 --> 26:45.768
I was just saying. He said it to her,

26:45.840 --> 26:46.921
and I thought it was cute.

26:47.040 --> 26:48.041
Mmm.

26:48.640 --> 26:50.130
Damn, bitch... I mean, girl.

27:00.960 --> 27:02.325
Are you ready for the ride of your life?

27:02.400 --> 27:04.607
Oh, my God!
Are we gonna go in your helicopter?

27:10.160 --> 27:13.687
I can't believe you thought I was
gonna take you on the chopper.

27:14.480 --> 27:16.209
We haven't even fucked yet.

27:20.720 --> 27:21.960
After you.

27:27.320 --> 27:29.163
Holy shit! You live here?

27:30.000 --> 27:33.049
What, a black man can't have
a nice place like this?

27:33.120 --> 27:37.125
No, a black man cannot have
a beautiful place like this.

27:37.200 --> 27:39.089
You know, Wesley Snipes
had a place like this,

27:39.160 --> 27:40.764
before he stopped doing his own taxes.

27:42.360 --> 27:43.486
How about some wine?

27:43.560 --> 27:44.686
Yes, please.

27:44.760 --> 27:45.761
Okay.

27:48.920 --> 27:51.366
Do you know why
I brought you here, Hannah?

27:51.480 --> 27:53.687
I'm assuming to make sweet love.

27:53.760 --> 27:56.366
I don't make love. I fuck.

27:56.520 --> 27:58.488
Hard and quick.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.161
Really quick.

28:00.400 --> 28:03.563
It's like a Ronda Rousey fight.
You blink and it's over.

28:04.080 --> 28:05.889
Okay.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.321
But first you're gonna have to sign

28:08.400 --> 28:09.686
a nondisclosure agreement.

28:10.040 --> 28:11.121
What's that?

28:11.200 --> 28:14.010
It's basically lawyer talk
for "shut the fuck up."

28:14.320 --> 28:16.129
Come with me. I'll explain.

28:16.240 --> 28:17.401
A nondisclosure agreement

28:17.520 --> 28:20.490
protects both you and me, but mostly me.

28:26.080 --> 28:29.209
Behind this door is my playroom.

28:29.280 --> 28:31.408
You mean, like,
for your PlayStation and stuff?

28:34.760 --> 28:36.728
Ooh. That's a nice key.

28:39.320 --> 28:40.606
So tight.

28:46.680 --> 28:50.082
Keyhole don't wanna open!
You ready to get opened?

28:57.960 --> 29:01.487
Reload, man! Reload! I told you to reload!

29:02.160 --> 29:03.571
I'm an Xbox man myself.

29:03.640 --> 29:04.766
Oh, you next, Black!

29:04.840 --> 29:05.921
You don't want none of this.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.525
Yo, when you done
with Wendy Williams over there,

29:07.640 --> 29:09.642
jump on this game
so I can shoot you in the face!

29:09.760 --> 29:12.366
I'm gonna be honest with you, Christian.
She's not attractive.

29:12.440 --> 29:14.090
Like, the bitch look like she got lupus.

29:14.160 --> 29:16.924
Well, you look like a thumb that's
been yanked out of somebody's asshole.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.924
Oh!

29:22.760 --> 29:23.761
Slam dunk!

29:23.840 --> 29:24.841
That's crazy. That's crazy.

29:24.920 --> 29:26.524
Yeah, well, how about... Ha!

29:27.600 --> 29:29.250
- I got nothing.
- 'Cause I'm better than you.

29:29.480 --> 29:30.925
Okay, well, I got something

29:31.000 --> 29:32.286
I really wanna show you.

29:32.400 --> 29:34.528
Oh, my God.
It's not more broke niggas, is it?

29:34.600 --> 29:36.011
- No more broke niggas.
- No offense.

29:36.080 --> 29:38.811
And don't worry about those
ingrown hairs on your penis.

29:38.920 --> 29:40.126
We can't see them through your pants.

29:40.200 --> 29:41.804
Don't give her all the dick, bro.

29:41.880 --> 29:43.564
- She don't deserve it.
- Half the dick.

29:43.640 --> 29:45.847
Over there fucking Charles Barkley.

30:16.960 --> 30:18.325
Fuck this shit! I'm out!

30:18.400 --> 30:22.121
Please, Ms. Steale.
Just keep an open mind.

30:42.520 --> 30:44.522
Tantalizing.

30:51.800 --> 30:53.564
Got these from my grandma.

31:02.760 --> 31:04.683
You're a sick motherfucker.

31:04.800 --> 31:07.531
No, Bill Cosby's a sick motherfucker.

31:07.600 --> 31:08.726
I'm just a dominant.

31:08.800 --> 31:10.404
What does that have to do with me?

31:10.760 --> 31:14.401
I want you to give
yourself to me sexually.

31:14.800 --> 31:18.282
Hence all the whips, chains
and freaky sex toys.

31:19.120 --> 31:20.849
And what would I get out of it?

31:21.760 --> 31:22.761
Me.

31:25.840 --> 31:27.330
Oh, my God!

31:27.760 --> 31:30.331
- Ooh. Let me get this straight.
- Mmm-hmm.

31:30.520 --> 31:33.490
So, you wanna beat me
with these paddles...

31:33.560 --> 31:35.528
- Whip.
- Whips.

31:35.640 --> 31:37.165
You wanna chain me to this rack...

31:37.240 --> 31:39.049
Eh... Handcuff.

31:39.160 --> 31:41.367
And humiliate me in unimaginable ways,

31:41.440 --> 31:43.886
and in exchange for all this torture,

31:44.000 --> 31:45.570
I get you?

31:46.080 --> 31:47.206
Yeah, that's correct.

31:47.320 --> 31:48.845
And women go for this?

31:49.240 --> 31:50.651
Some women.

31:52.160 --> 31:56.210
- It's like Disneyland for grown-ups.
- Yeah.

31:56.840 --> 31:58.046
So, what do you think?

31:58.160 --> 32:00.561
I'm pretty much cool with anything,

32:00.680 --> 32:04.002
as long as you promise you won't
tell my dad I fucked a black guy.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.162
So, what do you think?

32:10.000 --> 32:12.048
Two things. Where's the cup,

32:12.120 --> 32:13.849
and when do we eat shit?

32:17.680 --> 32:19.842
What we supposed to do in here?

32:20.000 --> 32:22.765
Well, I thought we'd start
with a little bit of rope play.

32:23.360 --> 32:24.521
No!

32:25.200 --> 32:28.403
Okay, well, how about I just mount you
to that rack over there and spank you?

32:28.520 --> 32:30.124
Hell to the no!

32:30.880 --> 32:33.201
Perhaps a little bit of flogging?

32:33.280 --> 32:36.011
I don't even know
what the hell flogging means,

32:36.080 --> 32:38.128
so fuck to the no!

32:38.720 --> 32:40.722
Okay, well, what are
we supposed to do then?

32:40.800 --> 32:43.485
You need to find Jesus!
That's what you can do.

32:45.800 --> 32:48.121
Okay, here's how it goes.

32:48.200 --> 32:50.726
I've drafted a standard contract
that lays out the terms.

32:51.080 --> 32:53.481
Lots of sex, we have more sex.

32:53.560 --> 32:55.562
Yadda-yadda, we end with sex.

32:56.040 --> 32:59.010
You look it over, and you negotiate
what you're willing to do.

32:59.480 --> 33:02.404
I hate to throw a monkey wrench

33:02.480 --> 33:04.164
into the whole works here,

33:05.400 --> 33:06.481
but I...

33:06.560 --> 33:07.641
You have low self-esteem?

33:07.720 --> 33:09.484
No. I...

33:09.560 --> 33:11.449
You have daddy issues.

33:12.960 --> 33:14.166
No.

33:15.280 --> 33:17.328
What I'm trying to tell you is, I'm a...

33:19.600 --> 33:21.250
- A virgin?
- Yeah.

33:22.520 --> 33:25.444
Man! I can't believe this!

33:26.280 --> 33:27.486
I don't understand!

33:27.600 --> 33:30.410
Okay, tell me you've done something.

33:30.480 --> 33:31.606
Blowjob?

33:31.800 --> 33:34.280
- Where does the blowing come in?
- Finger pop?

33:34.360 --> 33:36.522
- No.
- Angry panda?

33:36.600 --> 33:39.126
- Why is it angry?
- Why did you ask that?

33:39.680 --> 33:42.843
Oh, my God! Okay,
tell me you've done anal.

33:42.920 --> 33:44.160
I know how it goes.

33:44.280 --> 33:46.647
You let guys put it in your little
rusty bullet hole

33:46.760 --> 33:49.520
so you can tell your mama
and your pastor that you're still a virgin.

33:49.600 --> 33:51.250
I've just been waiting.

33:51.320 --> 33:52.651
For what?

33:52.720 --> 33:55.007
Girl, you are 20-something years old!

33:55.120 --> 33:57.805
It don't get no better.
It's going to spoil!

33:58.120 --> 34:02.569
It's fermenting down there.
Just fermenting. Okay?

34:02.640 --> 34:04.642
You gonna tell me nobody wanted the pussy?

34:05.120 --> 34:08.886
Well, I just am very selective
about who I've wanted to...

34:08.960 --> 34:10.041
Oh, selective?

34:10.120 --> 34:13.449
Oh, that sound like something somebody
with a pussy that nobody wanted would say.

34:13.520 --> 34:15.409
- Hey.
- Don't get me wrong.

34:15.480 --> 34:18.290
I don't want it all worn out
like an old washing machine belt

34:18.360 --> 34:21.648
or hanging like wet straps in a car wash

34:21.719 --> 34:25.645
or flapping around like an inflatable
figure outside of a mattress store.

34:25.719 --> 34:28.007
But I want it to have some experience.

34:30.080 --> 34:31.366
Okay, look.

34:32.520 --> 34:35.364
We're gonna fix this situation. Right now.

34:36.760 --> 34:38.842
I've been waiting my whole life for this.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.239
Come on.

34:41.320 --> 34:42.481
Yes!

34:56.280 --> 34:58.408
Oh... Very...

34:59.000 --> 35:00.490
Very Sasquatch of you.

35:00.560 --> 35:02.688
Have you never had sex
with a virgin before?

35:02.760 --> 35:04.125
Not a hairy one.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.650
Ow! You nicked me!

35:13.720 --> 35:14.721
Shh...

35:20.360 --> 35:22.044
What the hell?

35:22.880 --> 35:24.882
Oh, yeah, I have an outie.

35:27.640 --> 35:29.165
Oh, wow!

35:29.960 --> 35:31.086
Whoa!

35:31.360 --> 35:32.691
That got flavor!

35:33.560 --> 35:36.609
- What?
- You're the first person who's seen it.

35:36.720 --> 35:38.404
Little Eskimo kisses?

35:40.240 --> 35:42.891
Ooh, I never had anyone
do that to it before.

35:44.960 --> 35:47.247
- Ooh! Watch the teeth!
- Sorry.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.331
Got him.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.411
Okay.

36:20.760 --> 36:22.444
Sorry. I didn't have time to shower.

36:22.520 --> 36:23.601
Shit!

36:39.480 --> 36:40.481
Thank you.

36:42.160 --> 36:43.491
Ooh!

36:45.040 --> 36:46.963
Okay. You ready?

36:47.360 --> 36:49.806
I'm gonna take you
to a whole 'nother galaxy!

36:49.880 --> 36:51.530
Oh, my God, I'm coming!

36:54.040 --> 36:56.520
Oh, God!

36:59.560 --> 37:02.848
God! God! God! God!

37:03.720 --> 37:05.324
- Whoo!
- Already?

37:07.800 --> 37:09.131
Oh, that was amazing.

37:09.640 --> 37:12.246
Really? I guess I was expecting something

37:12.800 --> 37:14.086
different.

37:14.320 --> 37:16.561
Don't worry about it.
It's your first time. Don't sweat it.

37:17.320 --> 37:20.130
You'll get better with experience.
Just keep working on it.

37:21.440 --> 37:24.046
Oh, you know, it's customary for a woman

37:24.160 --> 37:25.810
to make a man an oversized sandwich

37:25.880 --> 37:27.166
to help him regain his strength.

37:27.480 --> 37:30.882
Either that or some leftover pizza,
or maybe a Hot Pocket.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.002
You want me to make you a Hot Pocket now?

37:33.280 --> 37:35.203
I don't make the rules,
I'm just telling you.

37:36.080 --> 37:37.809
You got a lot to learn, kid.

37:38.720 --> 37:39.767
Mmm...

37:43.520 --> 37:45.090
Are you asleep already?

37:46.000 --> 37:47.365
Nigga!

37:47.440 --> 37:48.566
Ugh!

38:16.120 --> 38:17.565
Christian?

38:19.400 --> 38:21.050
- Christian!
- Oh, shit!

38:21.120 --> 38:22.246
Who the fuck is that?

38:22.400 --> 38:24.289
My mother.

38:24.440 --> 38:26.602
Oh!

38:27.560 --> 38:28.686
Great.

38:28.760 --> 38:31.889
Now I gotta get rid of
two crazy bitches. Fuck.

38:33.440 --> 38:34.885
Mother!

38:35.040 --> 38:37.088
- Ah, Christian.
- Hello.

38:37.240 --> 38:40.084
Oh, you better get dressed,
or we're gonna be late for the regatta.

38:40.160 --> 38:41.969
I forgot that was today.

38:42.080 --> 38:43.570
You're not doing crack again, are you?

38:43.600 --> 38:45.329
- No, Mother.
- I never raised you that way.

38:45.400 --> 38:48.324
However, it is a prominent trait
in your genealogical pool.

38:48.400 --> 38:49.526
Hello.

38:49.600 --> 38:51.762
I'm standing my ground!
I'm standing my ground!

38:53.920 --> 38:55.251
Oh, shit!

38:55.320 --> 38:58.164
Mother, what're you doing?
That's Hannah Steale!

38:59.600 --> 39:01.250
How many times I gotta tell you?
Black lives matter.

39:01.320 --> 39:02.810
Come on, let's get you up.

39:05.440 --> 39:07.522
- Hannah, this is my mother, Claire.
- Oh.

39:08.920 --> 39:11.400
I am so sorry, Hannah.

39:12.960 --> 39:14.485
Oh, my, you have beautiful breasts.

39:14.600 --> 39:16.489
I would've thought they'd be more droopy,

39:16.600 --> 39:18.443
like a sock with a rock in the toe,

39:18.520 --> 39:20.807
like in those
National Geographic magazines.

39:22.320 --> 39:24.084
You're gonna have to forgive
my mother's behavior.

39:24.160 --> 39:28.210
Sometimes she can be factually
inaccurate and quite racist.

39:28.280 --> 39:30.169
Do not apologize for me, Christian.

39:30.240 --> 39:31.730
I am your mother, and I love you

39:31.800 --> 39:33.529
like you were my own white child.

39:33.640 --> 39:35.642
But I still hide
my wallet at night, just in case.

39:35.720 --> 39:37.210
As you should, Mother.

39:37.280 --> 39:39.328
It is awesome to meet you.

39:40.480 --> 39:43.768
- Are you two dating?
- Oh, no, Mother, we're not dating.

39:43.840 --> 39:45.524
We're just fucking. Hard.

39:45.640 --> 39:47.927
And quick. Apparently, it's the best way.

39:48.480 --> 39:51.563
Well, I just can't tell you how
pleased I am to meet you, Hannah.

39:51.640 --> 39:55.247
I mean, you're the first woman
I've seen Christian with.

39:55.320 --> 39:56.810
I assumed that he was...

39:57.360 --> 40:00.204
What would Oprah say? "On the DL?"

40:02.320 --> 40:03.321
Christian, you can do so much better.

40:03.400 --> 40:04.447
Oh, Mother.

40:04.520 --> 40:06.170
You're one of the richest,
most handsome men in the world.

40:06.240 --> 40:07.480
You could date white women.

40:07.560 --> 40:09.085
Like Tiger Woods and Seal.

40:09.160 --> 40:10.969
Okay, it's time for you to go, Mother.

40:11.040 --> 40:15.170
Or like Taye Diggs or Quincy Jones.
Or even Ice-T.

40:15.480 --> 40:19.451
Hannah, Christian's Chinese sister,
Mai, has come to town,

40:19.560 --> 40:22.326
so we're gonna hide the cats
and have the family over for dinner.

40:22.440 --> 40:24.442
- You should come.
- I'd be delighted.

40:24.520 --> 40:25.806
It was really nice to meet you.

40:25.880 --> 40:27.689
Okay, great. Time to go, Mom.

40:29.200 --> 40:30.247
Oh...

40:30.560 --> 40:32.562
Now, where is my wallet?

40:32.640 --> 40:34.369
Still there.

40:34.440 --> 40:36.169
- You just never know.
- Yeah.

40:37.720 --> 40:38.767
Mmm...

40:38.840 --> 40:40.683
They're delicious. Mmm.

40:41.200 --> 40:42.247
All right.

40:43.920 --> 40:45.809
We had breakfast. Time to go.

40:45.920 --> 40:48.366
Ooh, look, your Uber's here. All right.

40:52.600 --> 40:54.204
Okay, what?

40:55.520 --> 40:56.567
Spit it out.

40:57.040 --> 40:59.088
Well, how did you get into this whole

40:59.200 --> 41:01.362
dominant-submissive thing?

41:02.400 --> 41:04.687
It was one of my mother's
really close friends,

41:04.760 --> 41:06.444
and my music teacher.

41:07.200 --> 41:08.804
I was 16.

41:10.320 --> 41:11.560
She was older.

41:21.400 --> 41:24.006
Don't look so nervous, Christian.

41:24.080 --> 41:28.847
All I ask is that you do your very best.

41:29.200 --> 41:31.931
I thought I was supposed
to be here for music lessons.

41:32.920 --> 41:34.570
Baby, you are.

41:34.640 --> 41:39.089
And your lesson starts right here.

41:42.640 --> 41:44.642
Hey, hey. Ooh. Snap.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.729
We got a regular John Holmes here,

41:47.640 --> 41:49.483
without the big dick and the stamina!

41:49.680 --> 41:52.923
Okay! Again! One, two, three!

41:53.080 --> 41:54.650
Ow!

41:54.720 --> 41:57.206
Do you know why I hit you in the head
with that tambourine, Black?

41:57.280 --> 41:58.486
I have no idea.

41:58.560 --> 42:00.210
Well, were you rushing
or were you dragging?

42:00.360 --> 42:01.805
I... I thought I was fucking.

42:01.880 --> 42:04.121
Oh! That wasn't fucking!

42:04.920 --> 42:06.604
Now, count off.

42:07.440 --> 42:08.965
One, two...

42:09.280 --> 42:11.169
Was I rushing or was I dragging?

42:11.280 --> 42:13.567
- Answer the question!
- You were rushing!

42:13.960 --> 42:17.203
Is that a tear? Oh! Poor little guy.

42:17.280 --> 42:19.567
- Are you upset?
- I'm upset.

42:19.680 --> 42:24.208
You worthless, adopted,
unloved little piece of shit!

42:24.800 --> 42:29.408
Weeping and slobbering over
my vagina like a 9-year-old girl!

42:29.480 --> 42:31.767
Now, for the last father-fucking time,

42:32.080 --> 42:34.924
- say it louder so I can hear it!
- I'm upset!

42:35.000 --> 42:37.765
Oh, Black, get off the bed!
You make me sick.

42:37.840 --> 42:39.888
- But I'm upset.
- Get off the bed!

42:40.000 --> 42:43.163
- You're not ready for this!
- I'm ready!

42:43.240 --> 42:44.401
Ugh!

42:44.560 --> 42:46.608
Willy? Willy, you're up next.

42:47.360 --> 42:48.407
Willy?

42:48.480 --> 42:50.528
You better get your shit together, Black!

42:50.600 --> 42:53.331
You're not gonna amount
to anything, sexually or musically.

42:53.400 --> 42:54.890
And you know what the biggest

42:54.960 --> 42:56.803
disappointment of all is to me?

42:57.000 --> 43:00.846
I thought all you black men
had rhythm and a big dick!

43:01.320 --> 43:03.209
Boy, was I mistaken!

43:04.400 --> 43:06.129
I have rhythm!

43:08.920 --> 43:11.651
You're all set, Ms. Steale.
Courtesy of Mr. Black.

43:14.920 --> 43:16.046
What the heck?

43:20.000 --> 43:22.446
What is that? Is that a drone?

43:23.320 --> 43:25.004
All right, just sign here.

43:28.320 --> 43:30.322
Thank you very much.

43:36.040 --> 43:38.441
Ooh, girl, another gift?

43:38.760 --> 43:41.127
Damn, you must be giving that bomb head!

43:41.840 --> 43:45.322
Wait a minute, is that a Retina
display MacBook Pro?

43:45.400 --> 43:47.289
Bitch, you lickin' that butthole!

43:47.360 --> 43:48.805
I didn't lick a butthole!

43:48.880 --> 43:50.291
Shit, you lucky, girl.

43:50.360 --> 43:54.126
Like, I licked six buttholes last week!
I got a Dell!

43:54.760 --> 43:56.046
Desktop!

43:56.120 --> 43:58.043
I can't take that shit anywhere, girl.

43:58.320 --> 43:59.481
Hey, the mail come already?

43:59.560 --> 44:00.721
No.

44:00.800 --> 44:04.964
It's just a weird sex contract
Christian wants me to sign.

44:05.040 --> 44:09.125
You sign that, but then you get
that paper, boo, all right?

44:09.200 --> 44:13.205
A bitch gotta get hers.
You keep licking that bootie, okay?

44:48.320 --> 44:50.402
We're done?

44:50.720 --> 44:52.722
- Wha...
- Yeah, I read your text.

44:52.800 --> 44:55.201
Wow face, sparkly diamond, poop?

44:55.280 --> 44:56.361
Like, what does that even mean?

44:56.440 --> 44:58.204
You got me all fucked up
with your emojis, like...

44:58.280 --> 44:59.520
Hey, how did you get in here?

44:59.600 --> 45:01.045
Does it matter?

45:01.120 --> 45:04.044
Yes, actually it does matter, because you
don't live here and you don't have a key.

45:04.120 --> 45:08.489
You don't need a key
to get in a hamper, Hannah.

45:08.640 --> 45:10.449
Here, now, help me outta here.

45:11.200 --> 45:14.090
You're lucky I wasn't
in your medicine cabinet,

45:14.200 --> 45:15.850
or your jewelry box.

45:15.920 --> 45:17.081
I tried to hide in your nightstand,

45:17.160 --> 45:19.162
but you had this Gideon Bible
in there and I couldn't fit.

45:20.640 --> 45:23.007
Wait a minute, did you break
in through that window?

45:23.080 --> 45:24.047
This one?

45:24.120 --> 45:25.849
Oh, no, that could've been anybody.

45:26.320 --> 45:29.608
The brick on the ground says
"Property of Christian Black."

45:29.680 --> 45:31.205
"Christian..."

45:31.280 --> 45:33.647
Yeah, yeah, it does.

45:34.040 --> 45:36.964
But, I mean, that could belong
to any black Christian, right?

45:37.040 --> 45:38.280
I mean, okay, shh...

45:39.240 --> 45:42.130
Enough with the interrogation.

45:43.440 --> 45:44.726
Come here.

46:17.640 --> 46:20.371
Do not move,

46:21.160 --> 46:23.891
or I'll be forced to punish you.

46:39.720 --> 46:41.051
I said don't move!

46:41.120 --> 46:42.121
Okay.

46:42.720 --> 46:43.721
Ooh!

46:43.800 --> 46:47.327
That feels weird.
What is that? It's so hairy.

46:56.760 --> 46:58.922
Yeah! Yes!

46:59.000 --> 47:01.526
Wait, wait, wait, don't move.
Don't, don't...

47:13.360 --> 47:15.089
Damn it, that shit was cold!

47:19.560 --> 47:20.607
Are you ready, Ms. Steale?

47:20.680 --> 47:21.761
Yes, Christian.

47:30.280 --> 47:31.327
Ooh!

47:31.400 --> 47:32.845
You brought a condom, right?

47:33.600 --> 47:36.285
- A condom?
- Yeah.

47:36.360 --> 47:38.124
Oh... Okay. Yeah, of course!

47:38.200 --> 47:40.362
Of course I got a condom.
Hold on one second.

47:40.600 --> 47:41.840
God damn it!

47:42.240 --> 47:45.687
Just knowing you care enough
to use protection excites me.

47:45.800 --> 47:47.404
Aha! Old trusty dusty!

47:51.040 --> 47:52.963
"March, 1982?" Aw, hell no.

47:53.760 --> 47:55.808
Yeah, I got one right here! Found it!

47:56.840 --> 47:59.411
Here, let me open it
up so you can hear it.

48:05.920 --> 48:07.490
Okay.

48:07.560 --> 48:11.121
I'm just gonna scoot
these little bad boys to the side.

48:11.480 --> 48:14.245
Oh! And then I'm gonna
park this right there.

48:14.720 --> 48:16.882
Oh, my God, it feels so natural.

48:16.960 --> 48:19.201
It's like you're not
wearing anything at all!

48:19.280 --> 48:21.089
It's lambskin foreskin.

48:23.760 --> 48:25.364
- Oh! Just relax.
- What?

48:25.440 --> 48:26.601
No, not you. Now I'm talking to myself.

48:29.840 --> 48:31.763
Okay? Oh... Ready?

48:38.840 --> 48:40.683
That was like two strokes!

48:42.240 --> 48:44.447
This nigga's back here settin' records!

48:44.520 --> 48:46.682
They gonna put me on a Wheaties box! Oh!

48:46.760 --> 48:48.364
Thank God you're wearing a condom.

48:48.640 --> 48:51.007
I know, 'cause, boy,

48:51.080 --> 48:52.969
we wouldn't want to
get you pregnant, right?

48:53.040 --> 48:56.408
I know. I'm not even taking any
birth control and I'm ovulating.

48:56.480 --> 48:58.323
Did I tell you that twins
run in my family?

48:58.400 --> 48:59.526
Twins?

48:59.600 --> 49:01.090
My sister had sextuplets.

49:01.160 --> 49:02.161
Sextu...

49:03.440 --> 49:07.081
Oh, really?
Let me just get an after-sex mint.

49:07.960 --> 49:09.405
Here, Hannah, here.

49:09.480 --> 49:11.323
Have one of these. Here you go.

49:11.400 --> 49:12.606
Yeah.

49:12.720 --> 49:14.688
- Ugh! It tastes weird.
- All done?

49:14.760 --> 49:15.886
Ah!

49:16.560 --> 49:18.722
Good girl. Phew!

49:58.200 --> 49:59.611
Shall we begin, Ms. Steale?

49:59.920 --> 50:02.241
Page one, paragraph one.

50:02.840 --> 50:04.251
This must change!

50:05.360 --> 50:06.725
There's a typo in the header.

50:08.920 --> 50:09.967
That's it?

50:10.040 --> 50:12.964
Mr. Black, I will end
this negotiation right now!

50:13.760 --> 50:15.649
My apologies.

50:16.400 --> 50:18.243
Page four, section 13-20.

50:18.520 --> 50:20.841
With regards to anal fisting...

50:21.200 --> 50:23.680
- Is there a problem?
- Absolutely not.

50:24.920 --> 50:26.445
And strike out vaginal fisting.

50:26.520 --> 50:27.726
I mean, if you're gonna do anal,

50:27.800 --> 50:30.690
you're obviously gonna have vaginal fisting.
I mean, it's a given.

50:30.760 --> 50:32.285
Oh, for sure. I will put that...

50:32.360 --> 50:34.442
I'm putting that in there in bold.

50:34.520 --> 50:38.889
Next page, sex toys.
"Are they acceptable to the submissive?"

50:39.440 --> 50:42.967
Dildos, I guess. Butt plugs, fine.

50:43.160 --> 50:44.321
- Fuck yeah!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...

50:44.400 --> 50:45.526
How did this slip through the cracks?

50:45.600 --> 50:46.726
What's with the genital clamps?

50:46.800 --> 50:48.802
Sorry, Ms. Steale, I...

50:48.880 --> 50:50.769
I can't seem to find those in my...

50:50.840 --> 50:52.968
Because you forgot to put them in there.

50:53.920 --> 50:55.490
Rookie move, Mr. Black.

50:56.320 --> 50:57.606
Silly me.

51:05.120 --> 51:08.602
Let's be clear. I will not share you
with another woman.

51:10.080 --> 51:12.321
- I require at least two or three.
- Five.

51:12.400 --> 51:14.129
- Seven.
- Seven it is.

51:14.240 --> 51:16.481
You're not gonna
shortchange me, Mr. Black.

51:16.640 --> 51:18.802
You drive a hard bargain, Ms. Steale.

51:19.240 --> 51:21.163
- Thank you.
- You know, Ms. Steale,

51:21.240 --> 51:23.527
I'd like to fuck you
into the middle of next month.

51:23.920 --> 51:26.082
Silly. You couldn't fuck me

51:26.160 --> 51:27.889
into the middle of the next minute.

51:27.960 --> 51:29.849
I'll fuck you into a different galaxy.

51:29.920 --> 51:32.082
You'll be like, "Oh, shit,
it's cold in Pluto!"

51:32.160 --> 51:34.686
Yeah, well, I'm gonna fuck you
at the Stephen Hawking exhibit.

51:34.760 --> 51:38.447
And I'm gonna ram your ass so hard that I
cause a tear in the time-space continuum.

51:38.520 --> 51:41.325
I'll fuck you through slavery times,
and you'll get your freedom papers.

51:41.480 --> 51:44.765
Yeah, well, I'm gonna rent me a DeLorean
and fuck you back to the future.

51:44.840 --> 51:48.005
I'll fuck you into a whole 'nother planet,
where that insect is from Men in Black.

51:48.080 --> 51:50.367
You'll be like, "Oh, shit!
How many times you fuck me?"

51:50.440 --> 51:52.966
Three million, 746 hundred million times.

51:53.040 --> 51:54.087
And you'd be like, "Why?"

51:54.160 --> 51:56.162
And I'd be like, "Shut up,"
and I hit you with the neuron, like...

51:58.680 --> 52:00.045
You'd be like,

52:00.880 --> 52:03.645
"Oh, my God, why is my vagina so sore?"

52:03.720 --> 52:05.768
And I'd be like, "You fell."

52:06.640 --> 52:08.802
Well played, Mr. Black.

52:08.880 --> 52:10.041
I've done this before.

52:12.320 --> 52:15.164
And he's a major beneficiary
of our university.

52:15.240 --> 52:18.130
Interestingly enough, he donates all cash.

52:18.720 --> 52:22.008
Usually in ones, fives, twenties,

52:22.080 --> 52:25.243
the odd rolled-up $100 bill
that's got a little bit of powder on it.

52:25.600 --> 52:28.251
Please welcome Mr. Christian Black.

52:32.560 --> 52:35.291
What you talkin' 'bout my business, huh?
Don't get cut.

52:38.240 --> 52:41.961
Thank you.
Let's talk about life and your purpose.

52:42.560 --> 52:47.327
You all spent four hard years
in this school getting your diploma,

52:47.400 --> 52:50.529
putting your parents in debt,

52:50.600 --> 52:51.601
for what?

52:52.040 --> 52:56.250
Between global warming
and the world economy crashing,

52:56.360 --> 52:59.204
I don't even know why you're
trying to better yourselves.

52:59.320 --> 53:02.449
Give up hope! Think about it.

53:02.520 --> 53:04.443
You are wasting time.

53:04.560 --> 53:07.291
You. You're a drug addict
waiting to happen.

53:07.360 --> 53:10.569
Look at you. You can't wait to get
outta here and smoke some weed.

53:10.640 --> 53:13.291
And you! You are a stripper!

53:13.640 --> 53:16.246
Your ass is twerkin'
as I'm sitting here talking.

53:16.320 --> 53:18.084
You can find the rhythm in anything.

53:18.320 --> 53:19.401
And you, sir.

53:19.720 --> 53:22.644
Well, you're white. You'll be fine.

53:23.320 --> 53:25.687
So, in closing, I would like to say,

53:26.240 --> 53:29.687
"Thank God I'm not you."

53:31.200 --> 53:33.965
- Kateesha! Oh, my God, we did it!
- Girl!

53:34.040 --> 53:35.246
I'm so proud of you.

53:35.320 --> 53:37.288
Who you telling? I was close, girl.

53:37.400 --> 53:41.928
I was one handjob away
from losing valedictorian to that bitch,

53:42.000 --> 53:43.570
Lindsey Hung, right?

53:43.640 --> 53:45.404
- What are you talking...
- Shut up.

53:45.920 --> 53:47.649
I see that bitch, she talkin' shit.

53:48.200 --> 53:49.565
She gonna need a gynecologist

53:49.640 --> 53:51.927
when I'm done fucking
that bitch up! All right!

53:52.120 --> 53:53.565
Girl, I'll see you later.

53:53.640 --> 53:55.210
I'mma go punch a bitch in the throat.

53:55.400 --> 53:57.402
Lindsey! You bilingual bitch!

53:57.600 --> 53:58.886
So proud of you.

53:59.720 --> 54:00.846
Hannah!

54:00.920 --> 54:01.921
Dad!

54:03.240 --> 54:04.651
I'm so happy to see you.

54:04.760 --> 54:06.967
Oh! I'm so proud of you.

54:07.200 --> 54:09.487
You know, I thought
you'd turn out not to be shit.

54:09.640 --> 54:11.244
But you ended up looking real good,

54:11.320 --> 54:13.084
being that you from a drunken whore.

54:13.160 --> 54:16.289
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, your mama's over at the rehab.

54:16.360 --> 54:18.442
Twenty-seven times is the fucking charm.

54:18.560 --> 54:20.483
- Isn't it?
- Yeah, it's the fucking charm.

54:20.560 --> 54:21.925
Hey, where are my other stepdads?

54:22.000 --> 54:23.604
Right over there.

54:24.800 --> 54:26.848
Jonny Quest, B. B. King.

54:26.920 --> 54:28.604
I don't know who that nigga
is with his shirt off.

54:28.680 --> 54:30.364
That must be your birth daddy.

54:30.640 --> 54:33.530
Yeah, it's all good.
What a great bunch of guys.

54:33.720 --> 54:36.405
And you know the old saying,
"It takes a village."

54:36.480 --> 54:38.608
And it's true. Especially when it comes

54:38.680 --> 54:40.205
to your mom being a gutter slut

54:40.600 --> 54:42.409
and the village is a gangbang.

54:43.640 --> 54:45.847
- The village is a gangbang.
- Hannah!

54:46.720 --> 54:47.846
Hi!

54:48.440 --> 54:50.169
Hey, hey, hey, hold up, player!

54:50.240 --> 54:52.447
Shit, how you gonna walk up
and kiss the girl that I raised?

54:52.520 --> 54:53.931
What kind of shit is this?

54:54.000 --> 54:57.209
Ron, this is my boyfriend,
Christian Black.

54:57.720 --> 54:58.926
Boyfriend!

54:59.000 --> 55:01.846
Ron, to be honest with you,
I just fucked her a few times.

55:02.280 --> 55:05.124
"Boyfriend" makes
it sound serious, like I went raw.

55:05.200 --> 55:06.645
I mean, I might've dipped, but...

55:06.720 --> 55:08.131
Are you thinkin' about marrying her?

55:08.240 --> 55:09.321
No.

55:09.400 --> 55:10.561
What if she get pregnant?

55:10.640 --> 55:13.007
Still no, but hell no.

55:16.080 --> 55:17.320
I like this fella!

55:18.480 --> 55:19.970
I like this nigga right here.

55:20.040 --> 55:21.326
I fucks with your stepdad.

55:21.400 --> 55:24.285
You know what, from player to player,
Black, I really like you, man.

55:24.360 --> 55:27.204
- You can fuck anybody you wanna fuck.
- Thank you.

55:27.280 --> 55:30.682
Yeah, just don't pass her
around like we did her mama.

55:30.760 --> 55:32.762
- That's all I ask you to do.
- Yes, sir, out of respect.

55:32.840 --> 55:34.763
We passed her mama
around like a baton, man.

55:34.840 --> 55:35.887
Yeah.

55:35.960 --> 55:37.371
You never told me that about your mother.

55:37.440 --> 55:39.681
Your mother fucked everybody
in the neighborhood,

55:39.760 --> 55:42.161
and then wanted to settle down
with me, and I went for it.

55:42.240 --> 55:43.730
You know what, I gotta
hang out with you, man,

55:43.800 --> 55:45.768
get your knowledge, man,
'cause you got a lot of wisdom.

55:45.840 --> 55:48.161
I got a lot of wisdom
and I been through a lot,

55:48.280 --> 55:49.805
and I done been with a lot of hos

55:49.880 --> 55:52.929
and the smells that's on my fingers

55:53.120 --> 55:54.804
- over all the years...
- Oh, shit! What!

55:54.880 --> 55:57.247
- Still there. Never went away.
- Oh! Damn!

55:57.680 --> 56:00.604
Wow, sir! I smelled
every last single one of them!

56:00.680 --> 56:01.761
Yes, man.

56:01.840 --> 56:04.730
It was like beautiful and horrible
at the same time.

56:04.840 --> 56:06.888
I've stuck my hands in some of

56:06.960 --> 56:09.361
the nastiest bitches'
pants all over the world.

56:09.440 --> 56:10.487
Really?

56:10.560 --> 56:13.404
- Asia, Malaysia, Congo.
- Hmm.

56:13.880 --> 56:15.530
That's Dubai right there.

56:15.640 --> 56:17.324
Wow, I smell the hair.

56:17.560 --> 56:19.961
Touched a bitch's booty hole
in Dubai at the airport.

56:20.040 --> 56:22.202
I bet you could probably spit
a lot of game to me, my nigga.

56:22.280 --> 56:24.846
Let's take a picture, let me get a picture
of me and you. Make it a selfie.

56:24.920 --> 56:26.046
No, no, baby. Just me and him.

56:26.120 --> 56:28.726
Ready? One, two, three. Nigga!

56:33.400 --> 56:34.731
Where are we going?

56:36.960 --> 56:38.086
Congratulations, Hannah.

56:38.160 --> 56:39.810
That's a car.

56:40.280 --> 56:41.611
With a broken window?

56:41.680 --> 56:42.920
Do you like it?

56:46.120 --> 56:49.408
Yeah. It's nice.

56:49.480 --> 56:51.209
You know what I went through
to steal this car?

56:52.320 --> 56:55.085
I mean...
The car was a steal.

56:56.960 --> 56:58.883
- Did you just roll your eyes at me?
- No.

56:59.000 --> 57:00.684
Listen, there's only two things I hate,

57:00.840 --> 57:03.207
when you roll your eyes
at me and Craisins.

57:03.600 --> 57:07.810
Like, what is a Craisin?
It's not a cranberry, it's not a raisin.

57:07.880 --> 57:09.530
Like, it doesn't even make sense.

57:10.720 --> 57:13.246
- You just rolled your eyes at me again!
- No, I didn't.

57:13.320 --> 57:15.288
Yes, you did. I have it on tape.

57:15.360 --> 57:16.771
Check this out. Look at this.

57:18.960 --> 57:21.850
Oh, what's she doing?
She's rolling her eye. Look at that.

57:22.800 --> 57:24.962
- How did you do that?
- Come on, you, with me, now.

57:25.040 --> 57:26.087
But...

57:26.160 --> 57:28.401
Teach you a little lesson about
rolling your eyes. Come on.

57:32.840 --> 57:33.841
Oh.

57:35.000 --> 57:37.321
Now, do you know why I'm gonna punish you?

57:37.560 --> 57:40.040
Because you're a sicko
who likes abusing women.

57:40.360 --> 57:43.569
While there may be some truth
to that, that's not the reason.

57:44.320 --> 57:46.004
Because I rolled my eyes.

57:46.080 --> 57:47.161
Bingo.

57:49.720 --> 57:50.721
Oh!

57:53.400 --> 57:57.883
This is gonna hurt you a whole
lot more than it's gonna hurt me.

58:01.240 --> 58:04.084
Ha!

58:04.280 --> 58:06.487
Welcome to my world.

58:07.480 --> 58:10.165
Oh, God! Fuck!

58:10.720 --> 58:12.882
Ooh, that hurt! Oh!

58:13.240 --> 58:14.446
Did you do it?

58:14.560 --> 58:16.927
Ow.

58:17.200 --> 58:19.851
Okay, 15 across, "winter beverage."

58:19.920 --> 58:22.082
Nothing? You don't feel nothing?

58:22.960 --> 58:24.246
I love knitting.

58:30.560 --> 58:33.609
Are you gonna spank me?
All this build-up is getting boring.

58:33.680 --> 58:35.364
Okay, okay, you wanna play?

58:35.440 --> 58:37.044
Oh, I got something for you.

58:37.120 --> 58:38.246
Excuse me.

58:40.760 --> 58:44.162
Enough of your games.
It's about to get real dark in here.

58:44.240 --> 58:45.321
Sure.

58:47.720 --> 58:49.370
Are you gonna find something
that actually works?

58:49.440 --> 58:52.091
Big brother almighty!

58:52.280 --> 58:53.520
Whoo!

58:56.560 --> 58:58.528
That was my sorority paddle!

58:58.960 --> 59:00.166
Oh!

59:00.640 --> 59:02.244
You know, Hannah,

59:03.440 --> 59:05.204
I didn't wanna have to do this to you,

59:05.800 --> 59:07.723
but you've been a naughty girl.

59:12.120 --> 59:14.043
Did you break my fucking stool?

59:14.640 --> 59:15.687
No.

59:17.360 --> 59:19.328
I think I'm pretty good at this.

59:23.480 --> 59:24.481
Oh...

59:24.560 --> 59:26.722
I don't... I don't understand.

59:26.800 --> 59:29.929
I fucking hit you with everything.
I don't get it.

59:30.000 --> 59:31.126
Don't feel bad.

59:31.200 --> 59:33.961
I haven't really felt anything down there
since I got my butt implants.

59:34.040 --> 59:37.408
I'll just... I'll see you back
at my place tomorrow. Yeah.

59:55.640 --> 59:58.849
When you're in this room, you do as I say.

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:02.362
- Is that understood?
- Yes.

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:04.408
- Yes, who?
- Yes, sir.

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:05.721
Good girl.

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:08.891
Hands up.

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:25.686
Turn around. On your knees.

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:27.800
Stay.

01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:38.521
Don't look at me!

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:54.324
Raise your hand.

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:11.767
Did that hurt?

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:13.001
No.

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:18.447
Sometimes the pain is in your mind.

01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:38.205
God damn it! Motherfuck!

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:42.161
And sometimes the pain
is not in your mind!

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:48.720
Jerk!

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:55.928
I have a very important question
to ask you, Ms. Steale.

01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:58.762
- Where is bin Laden?
- What?

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:03.483
Where is bin Laden? When was
the last time you saw bin Laden?

01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:05.688
Where is he?

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:07.569
I don't know!

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:09.961
He's been dead for five years!

01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:11.923
I don't keep up on current events!

01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:20.120
And now the real torture begins.

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:22.921
Where were we?

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:28.321
I can't remember the safe word.

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:30.370
Chapter 23.

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:35.803
"It was a cold, gloomy day in Seattle."

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:40.085
Oh, God, this book
is 50 shades of fucking terrible.

01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:43.369
Who wrote this, a third-grader?

01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:46.006
Please go back to the water-torture thing!

01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:53.889
- What's the safe word?
- Stop it!

01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:55.246
What's your safe word?

01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:56.526
I don't know.

01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:59.646
Please just...
Are you gonna let me down now?

01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:01.131
Yes, Ms. Steale.

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:07.489
If I could just find these keys.

01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:11.124
You didn't see the keys...
No, I know where they are. I just...

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:13.441
God, my arms are really starting to hurt.

01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:15.005
I got an idea.

01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:18.531
See, most people use a universal
lock key in their sex dungeons

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:19.965
for reasons just like this. Hmm.

01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:22.407
But what you got here is
an over-molded swivel key.

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:23.641
All right, that's a custom job.

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:25.807
You're gonna need somebody else
to take a look at this.

01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:27.609
Yeah, I don't know what to tell you.

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:30.841
Next time, I'd put one of those tracker app
things on the key so you don't lose it.

01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:32.684
- What are they called?
- Oh, I know the name.

01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:35.366
It's on the tip of my tongue.
It starts with a "T."

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:36.771
- Ta...
- Maybe Ten?

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:38.171
Telepathy?

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:40.971
Hey, dipshits, it's called a Tile.

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:42.809
Tile!

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:44.001
Holy shit, you're good!

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:46.201
- You went to college!
- Hell yeah!

01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:47.611
Come on!

01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:50.729
I've picked a lot of locks in my day,
but I've never seen anything like this.

01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:52.848
- Man, it's impressive.
- Thank you.

01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:55.446
Yeah. I got nothing. Who's next?

01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:58.131
Who's next?
What are you guys, Ocean's Eleven?

01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:00.009
How many more fuckups
are you gonna bring in here?

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:02.285
- Stand back!
- Oh.

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:05.845
On the count of three, the Great Mysterio

01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:08.764
shall command these shackles unlocked!

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.367
One! Do not divert your gaze.

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:13.602
Two! Illusion!

01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:16.122
Three! Mysterio!

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:17.731
- Thank you.
- Um...

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:18.881
Uh...

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.729
Yeah, that didn't work.
All the locks are still there.

01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:22.404
Nothing happened!

01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:24.244
Oh. I got nothing, guys.

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:25.646
Jesus Christ.

01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:29.770
Oh, speaking of disappearing, I have
a bar mitzvah in one hour. Mysterio!

01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:34.087
- Oh, damn!
- Oh, my God.

01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:43.848
This was not in the contract!

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.490
Where we going?

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:53.566
To my parents' house for dinner.

01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:56.482
- You look lovely.
- Thank you.

01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:01.569
Where'd you learn to dance?

01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:03.483
At this little club in Tampa.

01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:28.681
Dance!

01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:40.046
Yeah!

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:43.285
Ooh, wow.

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:48.441
Ah! Fuck!

01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:24.721
What's that?

01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:29.962
Oh, my God, he's got a baby dick!

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:37.927
It's just the lighting!
It's bad lighting! It's creating shadow!

01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:47.843
It's not little!
You're just little people!

01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:53.846
Hi.

01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:55.126
Oh, you made it.

01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:57.682
Hannah! It's so good to see you.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.047
Hi.

01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:00.804
Hannah, this is my dad, Gary.

01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:03.966
Are we ever happy to meet you, Hannah.

01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:05.491
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:08.041
I was sure that Christian was gay.

01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:11.610
He's well-groomed, loves Lady Gaga.

01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:14.247
Can't take his eyes
off of Anderson Cooper.

01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:16.930
What kind of Republican watches CNN?

01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:19.770
Hi! I'm Mai!

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:21.365
It's so nice to meet you!

01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:23.688
I can't believe you're a Republican.

01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:26.411
That's his deep, dark secret.

01:08:26.479 --> 01:08:28.050
Shall we?

01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:31.363
- I can't believe you're a Republican.
- Sorry.

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:32.520
Ah...

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:35.644
Mrs. Black, this food looks amazing.

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:37.290
Oh, thank you, Hannah.

01:08:37.359 --> 01:08:38.441
Well, it was important to me

01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:42.444
that our adopted children were
exposed to their native cultures.

01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:45.763
So, for Eli, I have prepared Balangu.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.048
It's a spicy goat dish from Nigeria.

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:50.801
And for Mai, of course,
we have Peking Duck

01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:52.848
from the Mandarin province of China.

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:54.201
I'm Korean!

01:08:54.279 --> 01:08:55.441
Don't be fresh, Mai!

01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:58.399
There are billions of starving
Chinese children

01:08:58.479 --> 01:09:00.846
who need their energy
to make sneakers for Nike,

01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:03.604
and they would kill for this meal.

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:07.127
For Christian, of course,
we have fried chicken and Kool-Aid.

01:09:07.319 --> 01:09:10.290
It's a very popular
dish in Detroit, Michigan.

01:09:10.359 --> 01:09:13.283
And your favorite, of course, hot sauce!

01:09:13.359 --> 01:09:14.770
Oh, Mom.

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:19.281
So, Hannah, are you interested
in having children?

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:23.331
Yes, I would, if I met the right person.

01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:28.925
Oh, you have no idea what joy
we have had from having our kids.

01:09:29.359 --> 01:09:31.362
Mai's the one that I
worried about the most.

01:09:31.439 --> 01:09:33.886
I mean, she was so sweet.

01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:38.090
I mean, it seemed almost inevitable that
she'd grow up one day and run off with Gary.

01:09:38.279 --> 01:09:40.122
Like that little
director fellow, you know,

01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:41.689
the one that married Mia Farrow?

01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:44.606
Oh, sweetheart, please stop.
She's our daughter.

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:46.569
She's a hot little number, though.

01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:50.648
Hannah, I would really recommend

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:53.291
adopting underprivileged children.

01:09:53.439 --> 01:09:57.445
Wow, that's really
just so sweet of you, Mrs. Black.

01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:00.371
It is a great conversation
starter at charities,

01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:02.761
it helps your social standing...

01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:03.841
Give it to me.

01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:07.250
...and your vag doesn't get stretched out
like an elastic band at Cirque du Soleil.

01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:09.004
Okay, Mom. Mom, please.

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:11.566
There was just nothing
I wouldn't do for my children.

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:13.722
I even learned to speak Mandarin for Mai.

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:24.450
That's not even a real language.

01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:26.251
Hit that bottom!

01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:28.688
Hannah, where is your family from?

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:29.761
Oh...

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:31.604
My mom lives in Georgia.

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:33.445
Oh, Atlanta!

01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:36.121
Oh, then your mom must be a stripper.

01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:38.322
She actually lives in Savannah,

01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:40.090
and she's just a housewife.

01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:42.368
Sure she is, dear.

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:45.125
I'm gonna go and visit her,
actually, in a few days.

01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:47.924
Drinks anyone? Drinkies?

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.082
- I'll have two.
- I'd love to, Mom,

01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:52.640
but I promised Hannah
I'd show her the estate.

01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:54.210
Home stretch! Yes!

01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:55.566
Excuse us, please.

01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:57.446
It's grocery time.

01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:01.451
It's like I'm on air right now!

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.286
How come you didn't tell me about her?

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:05.521
Who, my mom?

01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:07.244
My God, she has a nickname?

01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:10.966
Do you love her?

01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:12.724
Of course, she's my mother.

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:15.724
God, how long has this been going on?

01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:17.325
Since birth.

01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:19.289
Oh, come on, I can't compete with that!

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:20.725
Hey, you don't have to compete with it!

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:22.370
You're my boyfriend, she's my mom.

01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:23.726
They're two totally
different relationships!

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:26.571
No, they're not!
Okay, Hannah, you're mine, okay?

01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:30.406
There's no mother, no brother,
no cousins, no second cousin removed,

01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:32.727
no friends that you call cousin
'cause your parents are close!

01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:35.320
- There's none of that.
- No play cousins?

01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:36.970
No play cousins.

01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:38.610
Christian, what do you want?

01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:41.047
I want Kevin Hart not
to be in every movie!

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:42.645
Why? He's hilarious.

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:44.051
Come on, there's other black actors!

01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:46.009
- How about them?
- Like who?

01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:48.049
It could've been
Sam Jackson in Ride Along.

01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:50.407
Who knows what kind of crazy wig
he would have been wearing?

01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:51.931
I thought you wanted me!

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.331
What do you want, love letters?

01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:55.801
- Hickies? Edible Arrangements?
- Mmm.

01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:58.611
You know, that's not even real flowers.
It's fucking fruit.

01:11:58.680 --> 01:11:59.761
Yeah, but it's delicious.

01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:02.484
And it's a start, okay?

01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:05.882
And maybe we could advance
to a Tiffany's engagement ring,

01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:08.531
and a wedding where we invite
500 of our closest friends,

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:10.921
and then we have seven kids,
and we live in a big house...

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:15.324
Whoa. You had this whole thing
planned out, huh?

01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:17.721
You know, is it me or
is it hot in here? Shit.

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:19.848
You want me to be somebody that I'm not.

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:21.922
No, no, it's not me that's changing you.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.650
It's you that's changing me!

01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:25.370
Wait a minute.

01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:27.283
That's a line from the movie Radio.

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:29.161
No, it's not.

01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:31.123
Yeah, yeah, the movie
with Cuba Gooding, Jr.,

01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:33.925
where he played
this mentally disabled athlete.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.923
"It's not us that's teaching Radio,

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.809
"it's Radio that's teaching us."

01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:39.211
Nah, mine is way different.

01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:40.645
It's the same premise.

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:42.521
You complete me?

01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:45.167
Jerry Maguire, also starring
Cuba Gooding, Jr.

01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:48.164
I don't understand
your whole fixation on him.

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:51.608
You know, all this time I thought
I wasn't in the right place,

01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:53.251
but I was!

01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:55.530
That's Snow Dogs.

01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:57.005
God damn it!

01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:59.242
I gotta stop binging on Netflix.

01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:00.927
Hannah!

01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:22.527
That song sounds so sad.

01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:25.285
Not as sad as Luther Vandross'
Dance With My Father.

01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:27.647
Oh, God, that song tears me up.

01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:32.327
Every time I hear it,
I just wanna go, "Where's my daddy?"

01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:34.688
Christian, we have to talk.

01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:37.084
You mean like white people?

01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:38.605
What's wrong with that?

01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:41.208
Well, they just talk a lot, you know?

01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:42.884
They do it differently
than black people do it.

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:45.321
White people don't like to argue,
they like to discuss.

01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:48.729
Then they start throwing
around all these big SAT words

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:50.450
and putting a lot
of emotional guilt on each other.

01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:52.443
It's just too much to deal with.

01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:55.000
I like it the black way, you know,
where we curse each other out,

01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:57.242
we may fight, and then we get cool again,

01:13:57.320 --> 01:13:59.448
but we talk about each other
behind each other's back, like,

01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:00.760
"Oh, nah, I ain't
fucking with that bitch."

01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:01.966
But what you not gonna do...

01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:03.770
- But what you not gonna do...
- You not gonna do...

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:04.841
- You not about to "not" me!
- Uh-uh...

01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:06.929
Don't let me get to clappin', boo.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.001
Oh, hell no.

01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:10.208
See, that's... That's communication.

01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:11.441
I feel better already.

01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:15.569
- Christian.
- Hey!

01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:25.404
You're not upset because I haven't signed

01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:26.931
the contract yet, are you?

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:29.884
I mean, it's not even legally enforceable.
You know that, right?

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:33.049
What's important here are the rules.

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:35.566
And if you break them,
you should be punished.

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:37.045
How are you gonna punish me?

01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:38.491
First off, you'll get grounded.

01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:40.403
I'll make you stand in
the corner for an hour.

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:42.329
And then I will send you to your room

01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:44.402
without no supper, young lady.

01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:47.844
Christian, this is crazy.
Why do you need to punish me?

01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:50.327
Because I'm 51 shades of fucked up!

01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:54.928
You know I'm five-four
seconds from wildin'.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.526
I got three fillets for fryin'.

01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:01.726
I got 99 problems, but now a bitch is one!

01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:03.888
That's 100 problems, Hannah!

01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:08.526
I can only deal with so much. 99's fine.

01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:11.843
A hundred jus...
I can't even count that far.

01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:13.921
Okay.

01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:16.811
Then you show me the worst.

01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:19.209
I wanna see how bad it can get.

01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:21.209
No more of this pussy-ass punishment

01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:22.725
you've been doling out thus far.

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:24.245
I wanna go all the way.

01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:29.210
Is that something that
you think you can do?

01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:30.800
Thank you.

01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:34.441
Yes.

01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:37.409
Bend over.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.001
Hmm.

01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:47.881
Mmm-mmm.

01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:51.521
Hmm.

01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:55.801
Aha.

01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:03.604
Nothin' says ass-whuppin'
like good ol' Joe Jackson.

01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:06.611
Hannah...

01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:10.809
I'm gonna spank you six times.

01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:15.285
I need you to count with me.

01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:23.248
God damn it, motherfucker!

01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:25.522
I said count with me!

01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:29.408
One! Two!

01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:34.484
Jesus! It hurts so bad I can't
keep count! Where were we?

01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:35.647
I don't know!

01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:37.404
God damn it, Hannah!

01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:39.482
I don't know how to count, okay?

01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:41.244
My crackhead mother never taught me.

01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:44.761
How about this? Let's try in Spanish.

01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:46.291
- Spanish?
- Si.

01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:51.688
Tres. Cuatro.

01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:56.090
I'm not too sure,
but I think cinco comes after tres.

01:16:56.280 --> 01:16:59.124
Are you kidding me?
Cuatro comes after tres.

01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:01.886
Well, don't get mad at me.
I don't know Spanish.

01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:05.801
Look, my crackhead mother never taught me
how to count or how to speak Spanish.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.048
- Now we gotta start from scratch!
- No!

01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:18.967
Whoo!

01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:25.881
I am tired. Oh, God, that is exhausting.

01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:28.442
Oh, I'm gonna be sore tomorrow.

01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:31.884
Oh. Come on, let's get you up.

01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:34.284
Don't touch me!

01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:35.921
Hey!

01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:38.926
Does it make you
happy to see me like this?

01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:42.522
I mean, not really.
You look like a sad Gollum.

01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:45.888
Like you's all bent over,
and you're crying. You look a little crazy.

01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:47.851
Come on, don't hate me.

01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:49.046
Hate you?

01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:51.129
I loathe you.

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:54.449
Whoa. That's a thesaurus word right there.

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:57.082
I hate you the way black people hate cops.

01:17:57.240 --> 01:17:58.241
Wow.

01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:01.523
I hate you the way Republicans
hate ObamaCare!

01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:02.840
Baby, come on now.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:07.608
I hate you the way Kanye West
hates everybody else!

01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:09.808
Well, I'm kind of
with him on Taylor Swift.

01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:11.524
What is that bitch singing about?

01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:14.525
You will never do that to me again.

01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:16.204
You said it was cool.

01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:20.001
I know niggas, grimy niggas
who do not value themselves,

01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:22.162
and they will have no problem
coming down here

01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:23.651
to fuck your little ass up!

01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:26.525
- Whoa. Slow it up now.
- Just one "Cuckoo!"

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:29.281
And they will swoop down on you

01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:32.045
like pigeons on old garlic bread!

01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:34.408
You can't be cuckooin' on this mo'fuck!

01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:36.807
You gotta calm them niggas down.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.490
You know what?

01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:42.165
Let's try something else.

01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:46.246
Aw, this is cute.
I get it, a little role-play.

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:47.401
It's cute.

01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:49.130
Handcuffs. All right.

01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:51.328
You thought you were gonna
do this shit to me?

01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:53.482
You messed with the wrong bitch.

01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:55.005
You sound angry.

01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:59.569
This is for Kerry Washington
from De-jango Unchained!

01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:04.089
It's fucking...
That is Django! The "D" is silent!

01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:08.768
This is for Lupita Nyong'o
in 12 Years a Slave!

01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:13.601
God damn it! It stings so bad!

01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:15.603
All she wanted was some soap!

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:19.241
Even the antibacterial soap!

01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:21.243
This is for Denzel Washington.

01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:22.964
Wait, he's not even a woman.

01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:24.280
You're just getting crazy.

01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:26.169
But they made him cry in Glory.

01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:29.284
Who makes Denzel Washington cry? Nobody!

01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:30.407
You talkin' 'bout like this?

01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:32.482
See, look, I have a Glory tear.

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:36.207
If it wasn't for Denzel Washington,
Flight would've been a fucking Soul Plane!

01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:37.970
Shit!

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:40.202
Why the fuck did they
make Soul Plane anyway?

01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:45.200
And this is for the little white girl
in Fifty Shades of Grey!

01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:48.723
Johnson. Dakota Johnson.

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:51.008
She had to be naked
the whole fucking movie!

01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:52.366
That shit was just gratuitous!

01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:55.404
Whoo! Ah!

01:19:56.720 --> 01:20:00.566
It burns! It burns!
It feels like someone lit a...

01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:03.405
My ass on fire! Oh, God, it hurts!

01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:05.960
We done?

01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:09.487
Oh, no, nigga. No, we not finished yet!

01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:12.404
We not finished with you yet, nigga!

01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:13.806
What? Where you goin' with this?

01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:16.406
I'm about to get medieval on your ass.

01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:19.407
Welcome to my world, motherfucker.

01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:26.084
Oh, God!

01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:31.684
Oh, God!

01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:36.923
This hurts so much.

01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:38.770
I wish I'd died.

01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:42.521
Don't touch it! Don't touch it!

01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:44.489
Oh, it's tickling.

01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:47.048
Christian, I thought you'd like it.

01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:48.645
What's there to like!

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:54.803
What kind of sick pervert beats you
for their own enjoyment?

01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:59.366
Christian, you don't
want somebody like me.

01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:01.964
You're exactly what I want.

01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:06.369
A broke college graduate
with a liberal arts degree

01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:08.602
and no future prospects.

01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:12.450
It's exactly what I want.

01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:16.289
Christian, I've fallen head
over heels in love with you.

01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:18.768
Uh... Whoa!

01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:22.640
Slow it up. That is not in the contract.

01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:25.883
Like, it specifically says, and I quote,

01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:28.247
"Bitch don't love a nigga."

01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:30.722
Okay? And I double-bolded that.

01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:33.485
I knew I should have had
you sign this contract.

01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:37.483
Christian, I think
it'd be best if you leave.

01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:39.564
Get out!

01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:42.120
Fine, you want me to leave? You want me
to leave? Fine, I will leave!

01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:43.850
Okay? Wait, time-out.

01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:45.081
Um...

01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:46.924
I live here.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.321
Shouldn't you be the one leaving?
Am I wrong?

01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:52.921
Take an umbrella 'cause...

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:54.525
Bitch, it's raining.

01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:00.406
I need my car back.

01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:02.130
I already sold that piece of shit.

01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:03.406
I'll send you a check for $37.

01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:05.090
That is way below Blue Book!

01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:09.681
Hannah!

01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:11.524
Christian, you have to let me go.

01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:12.921
Please, listen to me!

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.126
No, you listen to me.

01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:16.846
You'll find someone.
Somebody who wants to be open

01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:19.366
to all the demeaning things
that you wanna do to them.

01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:20.601
Hannah!

01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:21.681
Christian.

01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:23.321
Ooh.

01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:24.401
Ah!

01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:25.841
God!

01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:37.485
How is he gonna love you?
He doesn't even love himself.

01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:41.360
Did you see his haircut, girl?

01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:45.490
How could you think
this was gonna end well?

01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:49.725
Never look back.

01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:57.006
Christian.

01:22:57.280 --> 01:22:58.441
Hannah.

01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:02.246
While running down 47 flights of stairs,

01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:04.650
I had plenty of time to think.

01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:09.561
And when I passed out on the 23rd floor,
I realized I owed you an apology.

01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:12.526
I just want to say I'm sorry
for the way I treated you.

01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:14.364
Especially for the whole
waterboarding thing.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.571
Turns out you were right about bin Laden.

01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:19.921
- Who knew?
- Everyone.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.001
Hmm?

01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:22.320
You hurt me, Christian.

01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:24.687
I know. But I have softer whips.

01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:26.603
You know the kind with the pink fur on it?

01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:28.447
It takes the sting off.

01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:30.124
That's not what I'm talking about.

01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:32.967
- You want romance.
- I deserve it.

01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:34.127
Well, what's more romantic

01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:36.168
than running down 47 flights of stairs?

01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:37.520
You know I pulled a hamstring?

01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:39.006
Did you die?

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:41.686
No, but that's gonna keep me
out of the Red Room for at least a week.

01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:43.560
Bye, bitch.

01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:46.041
Okay, okay, okay.
Hannah, wait, wait. Hannah!

01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:48.088
No, Christian. You are incapable

01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:49.525
of having a normal relationship.

01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:51.409
I know, but I'm trying, okay?

01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:54.290
I want to be like that old man
whose wife has Alzheimer's,

01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:55.521
and he wakes up every day

01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:57.250
and he tells her the story
about their lives together.

01:23:57.480 --> 01:23:59.608
And then they take a nap,
but they don't wake up.

01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:01.406
Because they're dead.

01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:02.925
That's The Notebook.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.565
That's the one with Ryan Gosling
and the girl with the big-ass forehead?

01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:06.641
Oh.

01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:08.326
He never forgot her.

01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:10.562
You don't even like
Nicholas Sparks movies.

01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:12.882
I used to hate them, but now I love 'em.

01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:14.844
Even The Last Song.

01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:17.370
Why was that even a movie?

01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:18.726
You know that wasn't even a book?

01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:21.601
Well, if I'm gonna give you another chance,
things have to be different.

01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:23.011
I know.

01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:26.326
I have something very important
I wanna tell you.

01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:28.681
I lo...

01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:32.649
I lo...

01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:35.521
I...

01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:42.004
What I'm trying to say is, I love

01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:45.005
Empire.

01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:47.845
That Cookie just says the craziest things.

01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:49.646
Okay.

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:52.566
I love you.

01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:55.164
I knew you loved me.

01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:07.767
I have one last surprise for you.

01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:10.201
But you're gonna have to pack a bag.

01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:11.771
Are we gonna go on your private jet?

01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:13.205
Oh, my God, what kind of jet is it?

01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:15.760
No, no, no. Don't tell me.
I want to be surprised.

01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:21.727
Ah!

01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:25.168
I can't believe you thought
I'd take you on a private jet.

01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:27.641
I love you and all,
but you don't even have a ring yet.
