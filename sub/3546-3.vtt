WEBVTT

00:00.171 --> 00:01.178
Previously on
"Desperate Housewives,"

00:01.202 --> 00:03.250
as one affair ends...

00:03.274 --> 00:05.287
We don't have to
sneak around anymore.

00:05.311 --> 00:07.114
We can have a real relationship.

00:07.138 --> 00:08.185
Another begins. Edie!

00:08.209 --> 00:10.257
I had asked her if
she'd like to live together,

00:10.281 --> 00:12.019
and she said yes.
And yet another...

00:12.043 --> 00:13.660
This is Rex's mother Phyllis.

00:13.684 --> 00:14.769
Claims. This is Joe flannery.

00:14.793 --> 00:16.093
Are you aware
that my daughter-in-law

00:16.117 --> 00:17.994
has a boyfriend?

00:18.018 --> 00:18.995
Is exposed.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.627
It's not going to
break your heart

00:20.651 --> 00:22.069
to leave those sad,
little faces behind?

00:22.093 --> 00:23.470
And while some people can't wait

00:23.494 --> 00:25.472
to get out of the house,

00:25.496 --> 00:27.003
others are being kept there,

00:27.027 --> 00:28.697
against their will.

00:36.337 --> 00:39.786
Now which one
is Rex's headstone?

00:39.810 --> 00:41.118
I always forget.

00:41.142 --> 00:43.019
It's right down this row.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.791
Oh. Oh, yes.

00:44.815 --> 00:47.023
That's right.

00:47.047 --> 00:49.396
Over the years, Bree Van De Kamp

00:49.420 --> 00:51.598
had grown increasingly concerned

00:51.622 --> 00:54.461
over her mother-in-law's
forgetfulness.

00:54.485 --> 00:58.505
Oh, honey, did I forget to take
the pins out of that dress?

00:58.529 --> 01:02.109
Her lapses
had become more frequent...

01:02.133 --> 01:06.113
Sweetie, didn't I tell you
I was going to paint that chair?

01:06.137 --> 01:09.076
More glaring...

01:09.100 --> 01:13.250
Oh, dear. Didn't I mention
I waxed the floor?

01:13.274 --> 01:16.383
And more dangerous.

01:16.407 --> 01:19.126
Yes, Bree was worried

01:19.150 --> 01:21.128
about Phyllis' faulty memory,

01:21.152 --> 01:23.690
but she was more than happy
to remind her,

01:23.714 --> 01:27.394
especially when it came
to the important things.

01:27.418 --> 01:29.396
So have you given any thought

01:29.420 --> 01:32.399
to when you might be ending
your visit?

01:32.423 --> 01:33.470
What?

01:33.494 --> 01:35.442
Have I become a burden?

01:35.466 --> 01:37.174
Is that what you're saying?

01:37.198 --> 01:41.108
I was simply asking
when you were planning to leave.

01:41.132 --> 01:43.310
There was no agenda
behind the question.

01:43.334 --> 01:48.184
Oh. I-I don't know.

01:49.580 --> 01:52.119
Why don't we play it by ear?

01:52.143 --> 01:54.793
Yes, let's.

01:58.189 --> 01:59.296
What on earth?

01:59.320 --> 02:01.368
Oh, my god.

02:01.392 --> 02:03.270
What happened?

02:03.294 --> 02:06.203
It looks like someone
dug Rex up.

02:06.227 --> 02:08.535
Well, I got that, but why?

02:08.559 --> 02:10.276
Why would they do that?

02:10.300 --> 02:12.779
I don't know.

02:12.803 --> 02:14.643
Unless...

02:16.307 --> 02:17.414
Unless what?

02:17.438 --> 02:19.646
Maybe this has something

02:19.670 --> 02:22.219
to do with that
insurance investigator.

02:22.243 --> 02:24.851
Insurance investigator?

02:24.875 --> 02:28.295
He came by asking
all sorts of questions.

02:28.319 --> 02:30.197
I don't know what
you're talking about, Phyllis.

02:30.221 --> 02:31.828
Maybe you were at the store.

02:31.852 --> 02:35.902
Anyway, he was very suspicious.

02:35.926 --> 02:38.305
Suspicious?

02:38.329 --> 02:39.606
Oh, yes. He has a theory

02:39.630 --> 02:41.908
that Rex didn't die
of a heart attack.

02:41.932 --> 02:44.371
He thinks he was poisoned.

02:44.395 --> 02:45.872
It was in that moment

02:45.896 --> 02:48.144
Bree could finally
see the truth.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.777
Did I not mention that?

02:50.801 --> 02:53.450
Her mother-in-law's
memory was fine.

02:53.474 --> 02:58.185
It was her soul that was faulty.

02:58.209 --> 03:06.209
♪♪♪

03:40.551 --> 03:43.330
The parties took place

03:43.354 --> 03:46.933
on the front lawn
of 4347 Wisteria Lane

03:46.957 --> 03:49.306
every sunday afternoon.

03:49.330 --> 03:52.239
Chloe pendergast
would bring the tea set,

03:52.263 --> 03:55.242
which was appropriate,

03:55.266 --> 03:57.314
since she was the hostess.

03:57.338 --> 03:59.846
Brittany chries
provided formal attire

03:59.870 --> 04:03.520
from her mother's closet.

04:03.544 --> 04:08.355
And Marissa Anne McKay
invited the additional guests,

04:08.379 --> 04:12.799
some of whom hadn't been
to a party in years.

04:12.823 --> 04:16.963
Of course, it never occurred
to the three young girls

04:16.987 --> 04:20.367
that while they were busy
playing out their fantasy,

04:20.391 --> 04:23.740
one of the older girls
in the neighborhood

04:23.764 --> 04:28.344
was engaging in a fantasy
of her own.

04:59.870 --> 05:00.907
Hey...

05:00.931 --> 05:02.278
Oh, hi, Mrs. Solis. Ralph.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.680
Off to the mall again?

05:03.704 --> 05:05.412
You know me.

05:05.436 --> 05:08.315
There was nothing
Gabrielle enjoyed

05:08.339 --> 05:10.479
as much as shopping.

05:12.843 --> 05:16.663
And even when she couldn't
afford to take anything home,

05:16.687 --> 05:20.767
she took satisfaction
in looking...

05:20.791 --> 05:22.921
At the merchandise.

05:47.618 --> 05:48.925
Hey, Susan.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.427
What's goin' on?

05:50.451 --> 05:52.058
It's Karl's weekend
to have Julie,

05:52.082 --> 05:53.460
and they're always back by 6.

05:53.484 --> 05:55.402
That's our custody agreement,
back by 6,

05:55.426 --> 05:56.363
and it's after 6.

05:56.387 --> 05:57.764
It's like 6:15.

05:57.788 --> 05:59.065
Well, see? There you go.

05:59.089 --> 06:01.438
I'm sure they just forgot.

06:01.462 --> 06:02.739
Well, I have a court order.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.110
It's out of my hands.

06:04.134 --> 06:07.478
Yeah, it'd still be nice
if you gave him a grace period.

06:07.502 --> 06:08.745
Oh, I'm being nice.

06:08.769 --> 06:10.377
I could have him arrested.

06:10.401 --> 06:11.478
I mean, don't get me wrong.

06:11.502 --> 06:13.720
I am all for Julie
spending time with Karl.

06:13.744 --> 06:16.352
He is still her dad,
and she loves him.

06:16.376 --> 06:17.353
But...

06:17.377 --> 06:18.825
But he's with Edie.

06:18.849 --> 06:21.458
I mean, she's not exactly
the maternal type.

06:21.482 --> 06:23.530
I wouldn't be a good mother
if I wasn't concerned.

06:23.554 --> 06:25.397
I mean, who knows what passes

06:25.421 --> 06:27.464
for a kid-friendly,
good time in there?

06:27.488 --> 06:31.137
Drugs? Porn? Smoking?

06:31.161 --> 06:34.445
♪ ...Let it shine,
shine, shine, let it shine ♪

06:34.469 --> 06:36.943
Doesn't sound like
they're having an orgy in there.

06:36.967 --> 06:40.977
♪ All through the night,
I'm gonna let it shine ♪

06:41.001 --> 06:45.652
♪ All through the night,
I'm gonna let it shine ♪

06:45.676 --> 06:49.385
Well, obviously,
they saw us coming.

06:49.409 --> 06:54.090
♪ Let it shine, shine, shine,
let it shine ♪

06:54.114 --> 06:56.162
Whoo! That's a strike!

06:56.186 --> 06:57.664
Hey, guys!

06:57.688 --> 07:00.467
Hey! Look who's here!

07:00.491 --> 07:03.069
Parker, guess what I got.

07:03.093 --> 07:05.071
What? School supplies.

07:05.095 --> 07:06.503
School supplies?!

07:06.527 --> 07:11.137
Yeah, and the best part
of it is I got you

07:11.161 --> 07:14.981
a really cool backpack.

07:15.005 --> 07:17.714
Whoa, look at that.
Pretty neat, huh?

07:17.738 --> 07:19.486
Wow. Thanks.

07:19.510 --> 07:21.488
So on your first day of school,

07:21.512 --> 07:23.089
you and your dad
can find your cubby

07:23.113 --> 07:24.691
and you can hang it up.

07:24.715 --> 07:26.593
You're not taking me?

07:26.617 --> 07:28.194
Actually, your dad's going
to take you to school

07:28.218 --> 07:30.557
on your first day. Yeah,
just me and you, big guy.

07:30.581 --> 07:32.428
I'll be right there
to hold your hand.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.466
But I thought mommy
was taking me.

07:34.490 --> 07:36.102
Yeah, well, honey,
I have to work.

07:36.126 --> 07:39.035
Mommy's boss is
a mean, mean lady

07:39.059 --> 07:41.107
and if I miss work,
I'll lose my job

07:41.131 --> 07:45.071
and then we won't have any money
to buy food.

07:45.095 --> 07:47.113
Honey, you gotta believe me,

07:47.137 --> 07:49.797
if I could be there,
you know that I would.

07:59.610 --> 08:03.660
All right, I didn't know
it was that important to you.

08:03.684 --> 08:06.571
I will talk to my boss
and I will see what I can do.

08:06.595 --> 08:08.557
Thank you, mommy.

08:10.761 --> 08:12.669
Wow, I don't want to rain
on your parade,

08:12.693 --> 08:15.471
but he just totally
manipulated you.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.704
Well, hey, when a kid's
that good,

08:17.728 --> 08:19.528
you gotta give him his due.

08:20.801 --> 08:22.509
An autopsy?

08:22.533 --> 08:24.856
Detective, Rex died
of a heart attack.

08:24.880 --> 08:26.853
Well, there were some anomalies

08:26.877 --> 08:28.955
in the doctor's report.

08:28.979 --> 08:30.617
Anomalies? What anomalies?

08:30.641 --> 08:32.619
Ma'am, I'm afraid
I'm not at Liberty

08:32.643 --> 08:34.870
to discuss this
any further with you.

08:34.894 --> 08:38.664
Am I a suspect?

08:38.688 --> 08:39.626
I didn't say that.

08:39.650 --> 08:42.568
Well, if I am,
you're wasting your time.

08:42.592 --> 08:45.837
I loved Rex and anyone
who knows me will tell you

08:45.861 --> 08:48.234
that I was incapable
of hurting him.

08:48.258 --> 08:49.628
You sure about that?

08:52.703 --> 08:54.510
You talked to Phyllis.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.517
Again, I can't discuss the case.

08:56.541 --> 08:57.814
She's my mother-in-law.

08:57.838 --> 08:59.816
Of course she said
horrible things about me.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.588
Ma'am, lower your voice.

09:01.612 --> 09:03.720
She blamed me for every problem
that Rex and I ever had.

09:03.744 --> 09:05.627
So there were problems
with the marriage?

09:05.651 --> 09:07.994
Well, it was a marriage.
Of course there were problems.

09:08.018 --> 09:09.996
May I record this
just so there's no confusion

09:10.020 --> 09:11.527
over your statement?

09:11.551 --> 09:13.159
No, you may not record this.

09:13.183 --> 09:14.636
So you refuse
to make a statement?

09:14.660 --> 09:15.762
I'm not refusing anything.

09:15.786 --> 09:17.734
All I'm saying is
stay away from Phyllis.

09:17.758 --> 09:20.106
She's a... she's a raving loon.

09:20.130 --> 09:21.638
Ma'am, perhaps you'd be
more comfortable

09:21.662 --> 09:23.640
with an attorney present.

09:23.664 --> 09:28.644
You want a statement?
Fine, I'll give you a statement.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.118
My husband died
of a heart attack.

09:32.142 --> 09:33.880
I loved him very deeply,

09:33.904 --> 09:37.684
and your mother did a lousy job.

09:57.127 --> 09:59.175
To Bree's way of thinking,

09:59.199 --> 10:02.308
there were two kinds of people
in the world...

10:02.332 --> 10:07.814
Those who were useless
before their morning coffee...

10:07.838 --> 10:12.108
And those who weren't.

10:17.347 --> 10:18.865
What's going on?

10:18.889 --> 10:22.699
Don't rush me, Bree!

10:22.723 --> 10:27.704
I'm an old woman! Don't rush me.

10:27.728 --> 10:29.876
Get her out of here.

10:29.900 --> 10:31.878
I will tell you one thing...

10:31.902 --> 10:33.880
You wouldn't be acting this way

10:33.904 --> 10:36.744
if you didn't feel guilty
about something!

10:44.875 --> 10:47.894
What's the occasion?

10:47.918 --> 10:49.696
Uh, our anniversary?

10:49.720 --> 10:51.698
Oh, right.

10:51.722 --> 10:53.960
How could you forget
our anniversary?

10:53.984 --> 10:56.941
You sit in a cell all day long
staring at a calendar.

10:56.965 --> 10:58.304
What's the big deal?

10:58.328 --> 10:59.966
Our marriage was a sham anyway.

10:59.990 --> 11:01.668
Oh, we're not doing this again.

11:01.692 --> 11:03.409
In real marriages,
wives are faithful.

11:03.433 --> 11:05.747
Yeah, and husbands
remember anniversaries,

11:05.771 --> 11:07.073
so I guess we're even.

11:07.097 --> 11:08.815
Are you equating forgetting
our anniversary

11:08.839 --> 11:09.976
with cheating on me?

11:10.000 --> 11:13.649
You are clearly determined
to ruin this special day for us.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.157
What is wrong with you
that you don't feel guilty?

11:16.181 --> 11:18.324
I feel tons of guilt,
so back off.

11:18.348 --> 11:19.826
You never even apologized.

11:19.850 --> 11:22.128
I apologized a million times.

11:22.152 --> 11:24.360
Yeah, but you always followed
it up with an excuse.

11:24.384 --> 11:26.367
"I was lonely,
you weren't home enough,

11:26.391 --> 11:27.994
a woman needs tobe loved."

11:28.018 --> 11:29.996
A woman does need to be loved,

11:30.020 --> 11:31.968
and since you didn't
give it to me,

11:31.992 --> 11:33.970
I had to find it elsewhere.

11:33.994 --> 11:38.344
So that's what the teenager
was doing in our bedroom...

11:38.368 --> 11:40.707
Filling you with love.

11:40.731 --> 11:42.348
Say what you want,

11:42.372 --> 11:45.289
but John rowland loved me
like no one ever has.

11:45.313 --> 11:48.785
Not as a trophy
or as a possession, but for me.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.286
He lovedme.

11:52.412 --> 11:53.890
No, he really did.

11:53.914 --> 11:55.161
Mm-hmm.

11:55.185 --> 11:57.824
Let me count the ways.

11:57.848 --> 12:02.298
Um, gently, savagely,

12:02.322 --> 12:04.801
frequently, upside down...

12:04.825 --> 12:07.895
Is there a problem here?

12:09.059 --> 12:11.838
No, it's our anniversary.

12:11.862 --> 12:14.732
We're just reliving
the good times.

12:23.743 --> 12:27.093
That's an amazing car.
Aston Martin, right?

12:27.117 --> 12:29.155
Uh-huh. Brand-new.
Limited edition.

12:29.179 --> 12:31.858
A little anniversary present
from my husband.

12:31.882 --> 12:33.800
He's very generous.

12:33.824 --> 12:36.002
More than he knows.

12:36.026 --> 12:37.133
I'm sorry. What?

12:37.157 --> 12:38.504
I'm singing at church

12:38.528 --> 12:39.836
for the family follies.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.467
Edie's going to accompany me
on guitar.

12:41.491 --> 12:43.139
She's really good.

12:43.163 --> 12:46.843
So you and Edie
are going to be an act.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.244
Is that a problem?

12:48.268 --> 12:53.850
No. No. I mean,
I'm a little surprised

12:53.874 --> 12:56.431
that you didn't ask me
to accompany you first.

12:56.455 --> 12:58.084
On what?

12:58.108 --> 12:59.355
You don't play an instrument.

12:59.379 --> 13:01.427
I play the piano. You know that.

13:01.451 --> 13:04.330
How would I know that?
I've never seen you play.

13:04.354 --> 13:05.897
Well, I played in high school.

13:05.921 --> 13:07.964
So the last time
you tickled the ivories

13:07.988 --> 13:09.796
was sometime in the late '70s?

13:09.820 --> 13:12.768
It was the early '80s.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.946
Well, I'm not going
to argue with you.

13:14.970 --> 13:16.502
You want to do the show
with Edie,

13:16.526 --> 13:18.026
and I think that's super.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.548
So she's really good, huh?

13:22.572 --> 13:24.450
She knows her guitar.

13:24.474 --> 13:27.061
Apparently, there are a lot
of musicians in her family,

13:27.085 --> 13:29.115
sort of like the Von trapps.

13:29.139 --> 13:30.356
Hmm.

13:30.380 --> 13:32.580
Except, you know,
her brother od'd.

13:35.415 --> 13:37.793
All I'm asking you
is to go out and play

13:37.817 --> 13:39.795
a little bit of ball.
Is that such a big deal?

13:39.819 --> 13:41.797
Matthew, you are such
an excellent player, darling,

13:41.821 --> 13:43.799
that people will want
to be your friend.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.106
Then next thing you know,

13:45.130 --> 13:47.934
god knows who will be
wanting to drop by and calling.

13:47.958 --> 13:50.406
Sweetie, we need
to keep a low profile.

13:50.430 --> 13:51.908
Yeah, I know,

13:51.932 --> 13:54.280
but I have got to get out
of this house sometime.

13:54.304 --> 13:55.982
I'm going crazy here, okay?

13:56.006 --> 13:57.006
Aah!

14:31.041 --> 14:32.919
What is it?

14:32.943 --> 14:36.222
Oh, my daughter is singing
a song at church

14:36.246 --> 14:38.154
and I want to accompany her
on the piano

14:38.178 --> 14:39.555
and I haven't played in years.

14:39.579 --> 14:42.258
Oh, you were just so amazing
at Rex's funeral the other day,

14:42.282 --> 14:44.899
I was wondering...
I don't give lessons.

14:44.923 --> 14:48.285
Oh. Oh, okay.

14:49.559 --> 14:55.499
Oh. You have a little,
uh, on your...

14:57.067 --> 15:01.397
I'm baking cherry pie.
Excuse me.

15:08.438 --> 15:11.457
What happened to maintaining
a low profile?

15:11.481 --> 15:13.619
You keep being rude
to everybody,

15:13.643 --> 15:15.630
they're gonna start
whispering about us.

15:15.654 --> 15:18.164
You're right.

15:18.188 --> 15:20.418
We do want to fit in.

15:27.657 --> 15:29.297
Lynette, check it out.

15:33.003 --> 15:34.003
Jason's mouth.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.346
Stu, isn't that the new
video conference setup?

15:40.370 --> 15:42.240
Yeah. Isn't the resolution
fantastic?

15:47.517 --> 15:49.525
Hey, Nina. Mm-hmm?

15:49.549 --> 15:52.298
Uh, about tomorrow morning...

15:52.322 --> 15:53.659
Mm-hmm?

15:53.683 --> 15:56.010
You know how the first hour
of the morning meeting

15:56.034 --> 15:57.933
is always so slow?

15:57.957 --> 15:59.165
'Cause I've got this thing...

15:59.189 --> 16:02.238
Good god, this is not
about your kids again, is it?

16:02.262 --> 16:05.411
I know, I promised
I wouldn't do this,

16:05.435 --> 16:07.413
but Parker really needs me
to be there

16:07.437 --> 16:09.415
on his first day
of kindergarten.

16:09.439 --> 16:11.547
He's so freaked out
I can't be there.

16:11.571 --> 16:14.380
I'm sorry. How is this
my problem?

16:14.404 --> 16:19.055
Because we can't escape
the fact that I have kids.

16:19.079 --> 16:21.287
I love my job, but to be fair,

16:21.311 --> 16:23.289
there's gotta be some balance.

16:23.313 --> 16:26.497
Okay, how about the people
that don't have the kids?

16:26.521 --> 16:28.234
Did you ever consider
that they might need

16:28.258 --> 16:29.965
a little more balance
in their lives, hmm?

16:29.989 --> 16:31.967
Like, maybe they want
to go see a matinee

16:31.991 --> 16:34.070
or perhaps they want
to come in a little late

16:34.094 --> 16:35.507
after a big crazy night out

16:35.531 --> 16:37.443
or maybe they just
want to get a hair cut,

16:37.467 --> 16:40.146
which I, myself, have not
been able to do for two months.

16:40.170 --> 16:42.108
So, no, this is about fairness

16:42.132 --> 16:46.182
to the people who are
childless by choice, okay?

16:46.206 --> 16:48.276
Okay. Good point.

16:49.709 --> 16:52.018
Good.

16:52.042 --> 16:56.322
And I'm sorry about your hair.

16:56.346 --> 16:58.716
I can see why you're upset.

17:01.521 --> 17:02.498
Open wide.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.092
Not now, st...

17:06.756 --> 17:09.275
Hang on a sec.

17:09.299 --> 17:11.107
I don't understand.

17:11.131 --> 17:13.339
This system is gonna let
mommy be with you

17:13.363 --> 17:15.143
on your first day of school.

17:16.736 --> 17:20.465
The resolution is fantastic.

17:28.078 --> 17:29.355
The next day,

17:29.379 --> 17:32.358
Gabrielle decided
to cheer herself up

17:32.382 --> 17:35.262
with another round
of window shopping.

17:38.428 --> 17:41.437
But this time,
she was taken aback

17:41.461 --> 17:44.261
by what was on display.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.290
Mrs. Tilman. Mr. Delfino.

19:04.314 --> 19:06.361
I, uh, heard you were
back from the hospital,

19:06.385 --> 19:08.294
so I brought you these.

19:08.318 --> 19:10.125
Oh, I can't tell you
how long it's been

19:10.149 --> 19:12.258
since I got flowers
from a handsome man.

19:12.282 --> 19:16.632
I mean, I could,
but I don't want your pity.

19:19.289 --> 19:21.537
Where are you off to?

19:21.561 --> 19:23.769
I'm going back to Utah
for a few weeks.

19:23.793 --> 19:25.520
The recuperation's taking longer

19:25.544 --> 19:27.513
than the doctors anticipated.

19:27.537 --> 19:29.215
Speaking of my attack,

19:29.239 --> 19:31.517
have they caught
young Zachary yet?

19:31.541 --> 19:34.450
No, actually,
that's why I'm here.

19:34.474 --> 19:37.623
So the flowers were just a ruse.

19:37.647 --> 19:39.625
Figures. I'm trying to find Zach

19:39.649 --> 19:41.427
before he gets in
any more trouble.

19:41.451 --> 19:43.329
Do you know any friends
that he might have,

19:43.353 --> 19:44.830
anywhere he might be holed up?

19:44.854 --> 19:46.792
I know you were close to him.

19:46.816 --> 19:49.835
Funny thing, since he beat me
and threw me down the stairs,

19:49.859 --> 19:52.189
we just don't stay in touch
like we should.

19:54.694 --> 19:57.211
Since when do you care
so much about Zach young?

19:57.235 --> 19:59.275
It's complicated.

19:59.299 --> 20:01.647
I'll bet.

20:01.671 --> 20:03.949
I'm sure he's out there
somewhere

20:03.973 --> 20:06.282
trying to find his father,

20:06.306 --> 20:08.814
which I trust you made
impossible.

20:08.838 --> 20:12.258
No, I let Paul go.

20:12.282 --> 20:14.282
I couldn't go through with it.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.224
That was a mistake.

20:18.248 --> 20:20.226
He will spend
the rest of his life

20:20.250 --> 20:21.727
running from the police.

20:21.751 --> 20:23.499
I think that's
punishment enough.

20:23.523 --> 20:26.432
Zach is the only connection

20:26.456 --> 20:28.574
that Paul has
with his dead wife.

20:28.598 --> 20:31.498
At some point, he will run
back here looking for him.

20:33.333 --> 20:35.681
I don't like to be negative,

20:35.705 --> 20:39.365
but you really should have
killed him.

20:49.018 --> 20:51.527
At the risk of ruining
a lovely evening,

20:51.551 --> 20:54.760
I have some unpleasant news.

20:54.784 --> 20:58.364
The police dug up
your father today.

20:58.388 --> 21:01.307
What? Why?

21:01.331 --> 21:04.370
Well, apparently,
they want to do an autopsy.

21:04.394 --> 21:06.477
They don't think
that he had a heart attack.

21:06.501 --> 21:08.344
They think that somebody
was poisoning him.

21:08.368 --> 21:09.815
Who would have poisoned daddy?

21:09.839 --> 21:12.599
Well, apparently, I'm a suspect.

21:16.346 --> 21:18.324
Well, they always look
at spouses first.

21:18.348 --> 21:20.478
It has something to do
with statistics.

21:21.881 --> 21:25.281
It's just a formality.
I'll be cleared in no time.

21:26.516 --> 21:28.994
Would you two please
stop looking at me like that?

21:29.018 --> 21:30.666
Obviously, I did not
kill your father.

21:30.690 --> 21:32.368
I loved him deeply.

21:32.392 --> 21:34.340
Yeah, but you and dad
had a lot of problems.

21:34.364 --> 21:35.407
Everyone knows that.

21:35.431 --> 21:38.444
Yes, we had issues,
but I would never have hurt him.

21:38.468 --> 21:40.706
What about the night daddy
had his second heart attack?

21:40.730 --> 21:42.408
You must have loved him a lot

21:42.432 --> 21:44.410
to make the bed before taking
him to the hospital.

21:44.434 --> 21:46.944
I was in shock, Danielle.
You know that.

21:49.078 --> 21:53.288
Andrew, surely you don't think
I murdered your father.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.660
I know you didn't.

21:54.684 --> 21:56.822
You're not capable of murder.

21:56.846 --> 21:58.864
Thank you.

21:58.888 --> 22:00.966
That wasn't a compliment.

22:00.990 --> 22:04.320
It takes guts to kill somebody.

22:08.498 --> 22:11.377
Thank you so much for changing
your mind about helping me.

22:11.401 --> 22:12.938
I really appreciate it.

22:12.962 --> 22:15.811
I'm happy to help...

22:15.835 --> 22:18.744
And I'm sorry if I seemed
rude before.

22:18.768 --> 22:20.808
I-I was having a bad day.

22:26.376 --> 22:27.993
That's good.

22:28.017 --> 22:29.655
That's really good.

22:29.679 --> 22:31.857
You might want to
lay off the pedal.

22:31.881 --> 22:33.959
Really?

22:33.983 --> 22:36.010
Oh, I thought it made it sound
more professional.

22:36.034 --> 22:37.503
It doesn't.

22:41.831 --> 22:46.041
Boy, your son really likes
to play his hip-hop music loud.

22:46.065 --> 22:51.465
The good news is it drowns
out the sound of the dryer.

22:55.044 --> 22:58.884
Arch your fingers, Susan.

23:19.829 --> 23:24.149
♪ Let it shine, shine, shine,
let it shine ♪

23:24.173 --> 23:27.653
Hi. I'm sorry to interrupt.

23:27.677 --> 23:29.915
I knocked, but I guess
you guys didn't hear me.

23:29.939 --> 23:31.787
No, we heard you.

23:31.811 --> 23:34.420
We were just hoping that whoever
it was would go away.

23:34.444 --> 23:36.471
I'm still hoping that'll happen.

23:36.495 --> 23:38.424
What's up, mom?

23:38.448 --> 23:40.496
Well, I have good news.

23:40.520 --> 23:42.498
Um, I've been taking
piano lessons

23:42.522 --> 23:44.430
with Betty applewhite,

23:44.454 --> 23:46.937
and, uh, well, I just thought
maybe I could join you guys.

23:46.961 --> 23:49.134
You know, like a trio.
Doesn't that sound fun?

23:49.158 --> 23:52.478
I don't do trios,
but thanks anyway.

23:52.502 --> 23:55.541
Well, I don't mean to be
technical here,

23:55.565 --> 23:56.682
but this show,

23:56.706 --> 23:59.685
I mean, it really is supposed
to be a family thing,

23:59.709 --> 24:01.987
and I hate to point out
you're not family.

24:02.011 --> 24:03.819
No, but I have talent,

24:03.843 --> 24:07.553
and to most audiences,
talent trumps family.

24:07.577 --> 24:10.425
Well, what makes you so sure
I don't have talent?

24:10.449 --> 24:13.859
Hmm, just a hunch.

24:13.883 --> 24:16.632
Yeah, well, we've all
seen your talent,

24:16.656 --> 24:18.564
which is a nice way
of telling you

24:18.588 --> 24:20.466
why don't you put some curtains
on your bedroom window?

24:20.490 --> 24:22.067
Guys... Oh, come on, be honest.

24:22.091 --> 24:23.609
You didn't want any part of this

24:23.633 --> 24:24.910
until you found out
that I was involved.

24:24.934 --> 24:27.673
That is so not true!
Oh, yes, it is.

24:27.697 --> 24:30.716
It burns you that your
own daughter picked me over you.

24:30.740 --> 24:32.548
She did not pick you.

24:32.572 --> 24:34.179
It just didn't occur to her
that I would agree to do it.

24:34.203 --> 24:35.581
Well, now she knows,

24:35.605 --> 24:37.583
and if she had it to do
over again, she'd pick me.

24:37.607 --> 24:38.954
No, she wouldn't.

24:38.978 --> 24:40.455
Well, why don't
we put it to a test?

24:40.479 --> 24:42.457
Julie, who would you rather
have play with you?

24:42.481 --> 24:45.631
Oh, no, no, no, no.
No, it's okay, honey.

24:45.655 --> 24:47.232
Who do you want to be with you

24:47.256 --> 24:49.094
in thefamilytalent show?

24:49.118 --> 24:51.466
Yes, who do you want with you

24:51.490 --> 24:53.639
in front of all of those people?

24:53.663 --> 24:55.100
And remember, it's a church.

24:55.124 --> 24:57.204
They are going
to be judging you.

25:00.670 --> 25:02.578
Ohh... okay.

25:02.602 --> 25:04.780
Well, first of all,
you both suck,

25:04.804 --> 25:09.785
but if I had to choose...

25:09.809 --> 25:12.509
I guess I'd pick my mom.

25:13.683 --> 25:15.160
Sorry, Edie.

25:15.184 --> 25:16.662
Fair enough.

25:16.686 --> 25:20.246
I'd like my pitch pipe back,
please.

25:26.956 --> 25:28.503
It was you, wasn't it?

25:28.527 --> 25:29.905
Hello, John.

25:29.929 --> 25:31.537
Long time, no see.

25:31.561 --> 25:33.839
One of the neighbors saw
an Aston Martin driving away,

25:33.863 --> 25:36.181
and what do you know?

25:36.205 --> 25:38.183
Well, someone had
to tend to the yard.

25:38.207 --> 25:40.746
You were busy elsewhere.

25:40.770 --> 25:42.047
You saw us?

25:42.071 --> 25:45.050
Yes, and I have to say she's
old enough to be your mother.

25:45.074 --> 25:46.701
Hell, she's old enough
to be my mother.

25:46.725 --> 25:48.023
Joan's only 41.

25:48.047 --> 25:50.596
Joan?! You're calling herjoan?!

25:50.620 --> 25:51.857
Why shouldn't I?
She's my friend.

25:51.881 --> 25:53.198
I know your friends,

25:53.222 --> 25:55.030
and I have a hunch
you don't do to your friends

25:55.054 --> 25:56.611
what I saw you doing
to that wrinkly old lady.

25:56.635 --> 26:00.065
Okay, so you caught me
doing it with somebody else.

26:00.089 --> 26:02.738
What's the big deal? You're
supposed to be in love withme.

26:02.762 --> 26:04.169
What?

26:04.193 --> 26:05.571
How many times did you say it?

26:05.595 --> 26:06.912
How many times did you
whisper in my ear,

26:06.936 --> 26:08.243
"you're the only woman
I'll ever love"?

26:08.267 --> 26:10.015
I don't know. A bunch.

26:10.039 --> 26:11.747
So were you lying to me?

26:11.771 --> 26:14.149
Were you just trying to get
me into bed? No, of course not.

26:14.173 --> 26:16.126
I loved you, but we broke up.

26:16.150 --> 26:17.683
Yeah, like five minutes ago!

26:17.707 --> 26:19.655
Haven't you ever heard
of a mourning period?

26:19.679 --> 26:23.328
I know it seems quick,
but I have feelings for her.

26:23.352 --> 26:26.592
In fact, I think
I may be in love with her.

26:30.760 --> 26:32.037
Oh, my god.

26:32.061 --> 26:34.039
What's the matter?
Is it the baby?

26:34.063 --> 26:36.802
No.

26:36.826 --> 26:40.305
Oh, no, no. It's me.

26:40.329 --> 26:43.649
I am beyond stupid.

26:43.673 --> 26:46.712
You're not stupid.

26:46.736 --> 26:48.053
Oh, no, I am.

26:48.077 --> 26:50.616
Yesterday,
I was still fantasizing

26:50.640 --> 26:52.317
that it could work with you,

26:52.341 --> 26:54.690
that a one-bedroom apartment
might be cozy.

26:54.714 --> 26:55.901
Mrs. Solis, please.

26:55.925 --> 26:58.624
Oh, my god.
I almost left my husband

26:58.648 --> 27:00.718
for someone who calls me
Mrs. Solis.

27:07.697 --> 27:11.637
So are you upset because
you want to get back together?

27:11.661 --> 27:13.701
Because I can break up
with Joan.

27:15.634 --> 27:17.644
That's okay, sweetie. I'm good.

27:27.877 --> 27:30.926
So this is it for us?

27:30.950 --> 27:32.928
'Cause I really feel like we
should end it better than this.

27:32.952 --> 27:37.632
Actually, John, given how
stupid both of us have been,

27:37.656 --> 27:41.256
this is an entirely
appropriate ending.

27:54.373 --> 27:56.782
Mrs. Van De Kamp.

27:56.806 --> 27:58.123
What can I do for you?

27:58.147 --> 28:00.826
I would like to submit myself
to a lie detector test

28:00.850 --> 28:02.387
to eliminate any uncertainty

28:02.411 --> 28:04.259
about what happened
with my husband.

28:04.283 --> 28:06.270
Are you sure you don't
want a lawyer present?

28:06.294 --> 28:07.793
I'll waive all that.

28:07.817 --> 28:10.335
My only stipulation
is that I want my children

28:10.359 --> 28:12.397
to be able to see me
answer the questions.

28:12.421 --> 28:16.001
I think we can accommodate you.

28:16.025 --> 28:18.744
Is your name Bree Van De Kamp?

28:18.768 --> 28:20.375
Yes.

28:20.399 --> 28:22.778
Were you married
to Rex Van De Kamp?

28:22.802 --> 28:25.010
Yes.

28:25.034 --> 28:27.991
Did you and your husband
temporarily separate last year?

28:28.015 --> 28:29.314
Yes.

28:29.338 --> 28:31.386
Did you kill your husband?

28:31.410 --> 28:32.810
No.

28:37.116 --> 28:39.825
Do you know a man
named George Williams?

28:39.849 --> 28:43.228
Yes.

28:43.252 --> 28:45.130
During your separation
from your husband,

28:45.154 --> 28:47.838
did you have a relationship
with Mr. Williams?

28:47.862 --> 28:50.375
What does that have
to do with anything?

28:50.399 --> 28:53.438
Just yes or no responses,
please.

28:53.462 --> 28:54.780
Well, I'm not gonna respond
to something

28:54.804 --> 28:56.842
that's none of your business.

28:56.866 --> 28:59.284
Mrs. Van De Kamp,

28:59.308 --> 29:02.287
if you want us to take
this polygraph seriously,

29:02.311 --> 29:04.911
answer the questions
we ask, okay?

29:07.746 --> 29:10.425
Who's George Williams?

29:10.449 --> 29:14.499
He's our pharmacist.

29:14.523 --> 29:16.510
During your separation,
did you have a relationship

29:16.534 --> 29:18.733
with Mr. Williams?

29:18.757 --> 29:20.365
Yes.

29:20.389 --> 29:22.307
Are you in love
with Mr. Williams?

29:22.331 --> 29:23.839
What?

29:23.863 --> 29:26.176
Are you in love
with Mr. Williams?

29:26.200 --> 29:28.535
No.

29:33.202 --> 29:36.982
Um, I-I was thinking
of something else just then,

29:37.006 --> 29:39.484
so why don't you ask me
the question again?

29:39.508 --> 29:43.358
Are you in love
with Mr. Williams?

29:43.382 --> 29:44.852
No.

29:50.359 --> 29:51.766
Did you see that?

29:51.790 --> 29:54.990
Yeah, I saw it.

30:13.112 --> 30:14.489
Hello, Susan.

30:14.513 --> 30:16.400
Are you ready for your lesson?

30:16.424 --> 30:17.963
Yep, I am.

30:17.987 --> 30:19.965
I think I'm going to make
another push

30:19.989 --> 30:21.867
for using that pedal.
I think it adds grandeur.

30:24.823 --> 30:26.371
I want to talk to you!

30:26.395 --> 30:27.933
I'm busy now.

30:27.957 --> 30:29.004
I cannot believe

30:29.028 --> 30:31.977
you kicked Edie
out of Julie's performance!

30:32.001 --> 30:33.538
I did not kick Edie out.

30:33.562 --> 30:34.840
Julie made that call.

30:34.864 --> 30:36.121
Because you played the mom card.

30:36.145 --> 30:40.085
Well, it is a family recital,
and Edie is not family.

30:40.109 --> 30:41.086
One day, she could be.

30:41.110 --> 30:42.817
Ohh, don't even joke like that.

30:42.841 --> 30:46.055
H-How about your
plumber/convicted murderer, huh?

30:46.079 --> 30:48.823
He seems to keep popping up
at "family" events.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.896
It was not murder,
it was manslaughter,

30:50.920 --> 30:52.057
and that's totally different.

30:52.081 --> 30:53.398
Mike and I aren't even
living together,

30:53.422 --> 30:54.860
and he cares about Julie.

30:54.884 --> 30:56.301
Well, so does Edie, huh?

30:56.325 --> 30:58.433
She was really looking forward
to performing with Julie.

30:58.457 --> 31:00.005
If you think Edie britt

31:00.029 --> 31:02.167
cares about anybody
other than herself,

31:02.191 --> 31:03.508
you are living in
a fool's paradise.

31:03.532 --> 31:05.911
You don't know her the way I do,

31:05.935 --> 31:07.913
and the only reason
she's interested in Julie

31:07.937 --> 31:09.945
is to mess with my head.

31:11.240 --> 31:14.219
Hey, that's both crazy
andself-absorbed.

31:14.243 --> 31:16.153
That's a twofer! Way to go!

31:19.008 --> 31:21.056
Whether you choose
to believe it or not,

31:21.080 --> 31:22.557
they're both great together,

31:22.581 --> 31:25.151
and if you don't believe me,
ask Julie.

31:35.264 --> 31:38.534
I'm sorry you had
to witness that.

31:39.898 --> 31:42.047
Oh, that's okay, hon.

31:42.071 --> 31:46.081
I have lived my share
of family knock-down drag-outs.

31:46.105 --> 31:48.914
Well, I hope it wasn't as ugly
as me and Karl.

31:48.938 --> 31:51.987
You'd be surprised.

31:52.011 --> 31:54.960
Parker, honey, can you hear me?

31:54.984 --> 31:56.891
Tom, why isn't he talking?

31:56.915 --> 31:58.523
Um, honey, there
are a lot of kids here.

31:58.547 --> 32:00.165
He's a little stressed.

32:00.189 --> 32:02.027
Parker, say hi, say hi. Mommy?

32:02.051 --> 32:06.001
Oh, hey, honey,
this is so exciting.

32:06.025 --> 32:08.033
Your first day of school.

32:08.057 --> 32:10.475
You're going to make
so many friends.

32:10.499 --> 32:12.437
Lynette, staff meeting, now.

32:12.461 --> 32:15.540
Uh, right, yeah.
I'm going to be right there.

32:15.564 --> 32:18.013
Now. Now, now, now!

32:18.037 --> 32:21.316
Stu, this coffee, it's cold.

32:21.340 --> 32:24.089
Honey, I'm going to be
right back.

32:24.113 --> 32:25.690
Mommy? Where are you going?

32:25.714 --> 32:27.993
Right back.

32:28.017 --> 32:30.125
Mommy, come back!

32:30.149 --> 32:34.059
Okay, let's turn to page five.

32:34.083 --> 32:38.133
Damn. I forgot my prospectus.
Any extra copies?

32:38.157 --> 32:40.257
No? Oh, I'll be right back.

32:42.391 --> 32:44.469
Hi, I'm back. How's he doing?

32:44.493 --> 32:46.972
Um, um, honey, he's upset

32:46.996 --> 32:49.044
because he wanted to show you
his cubby. You left.

32:49.068 --> 32:51.046
Oh, honey, I'm here. I'm here.

32:51.070 --> 32:52.677
You can show me your cubby now.

32:52.701 --> 32:55.050
Nina found extra copies.
She wants you back now.

32:55.074 --> 32:59.424
Okay. I'll be back
in two seconds for you.

32:59.448 --> 33:01.078
Mommy! Mommy! Don't go!

33:02.411 --> 33:05.560
So the big issue here
is second-quarter billing.

33:05.584 --> 33:07.471
Where are you going?
Ladies' room.

33:07.495 --> 33:10.295
No. Nina, nature is calling.

33:10.319 --> 33:12.137
Lynette, hold it
for ten minutes.

33:12.161 --> 33:14.561
We have to get through this.

33:21.170 --> 33:24.149
What I'd like to do

33:24.173 --> 33:26.316
is trade out
the invoicing structure.

33:26.340 --> 33:29.614
Let's take a look at our graphs
on page ten, please.

33:29.638 --> 33:32.757
Lynette had been struggling
to balance her career

33:32.781 --> 33:35.060
and her family.

33:35.084 --> 33:37.622
She finally saw an opportunity

33:37.646 --> 33:40.995
to tip the scales in her favor.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.667
Instead of badgering
clients with invoices

33:42.691 --> 33:45.630
on the shorter term campaigns,
I say we bill on delivery.

33:45.654 --> 33:47.302
Yes!

33:47.326 --> 33:49.204
Bill on delivery, yes!

33:50.299 --> 33:52.107
Are you having a seizure?

33:52.131 --> 33:55.610
No, no, I'm just...
I'm very excited.

33:55.634 --> 33:57.174
It's a really good plan.

33:58.537 --> 34:01.086
Yeah, mmm.

34:01.110 --> 34:03.218
Now, what happened
on the burman account

34:03.242 --> 34:05.290
is that they were sent
duplicate bills

34:05.314 --> 34:07.722
by Tina and Ron in accounting

34:07.746 --> 34:09.054
and I'm not pointing
any fingers,

34:09.078 --> 34:10.554
but Tina, Ron,

34:10.579 --> 34:13.527
about walking in
and seeing all my lines lit up

34:13.552 --> 34:16.692
with disgruntled...
Aah! Ohh! Hot! Hot!

34:18.187 --> 34:19.264
Help.

34:19.288 --> 34:21.706
Stu! Aah! Aah!

34:21.730 --> 34:24.069
And that's why we packed you
extra cookies

34:24.092 --> 34:26.446
so you could share with all
your new friends, remember?

34:26.469 --> 34:29.074
Uh-huh. I think we're good to go now,
honey.

34:29.098 --> 34:32.147
You're going to be great,
Parker.

34:32.170 --> 34:33.217
I love you.

34:33.242 --> 34:34.542
I love you, too, mommy.

34:50.518 --> 34:52.496
Bree, hi. What can I do for you?

34:52.521 --> 34:54.839
Well, for starters, you can
help me prove to the police

34:54.862 --> 34:57.450
that we didn't conspire
to kill my husband.

34:57.474 --> 35:00.145
Okay.

35:00.169 --> 35:02.307
So because of
the anomalies in Rex's blood,

35:02.331 --> 35:04.609
the police started to wonder
if I'd been poisoning Rex.

35:04.633 --> 35:05.850
That's absurd.

35:05.874 --> 35:07.721
Lots of things can cause
high potassium levels...

35:07.745 --> 35:09.184
Renal failure, low sodium.

35:09.208 --> 35:10.585
Well, that's why I took
the polygraph,

35:10.609 --> 35:12.587
to prove to them
that I was innocent.

35:12.611 --> 35:14.141
Obviously, you passed.

35:16.114 --> 35:18.693
Sort of.

35:18.717 --> 35:21.196
Well, I think the police
now have a different theory,

35:21.220 --> 35:23.628
which is if I wasn't poisoning
Rex on my own,

35:23.652 --> 35:27.272
then maybe you were helping me.

35:27.296 --> 35:29.404
You're kidding.

35:29.428 --> 35:32.277
No, that's why I need you
to take the polygraph, too.

35:32.301 --> 35:34.139
W-What?

35:34.163 --> 35:36.150
It's the quickest way
to prove to the police

35:36.174 --> 35:37.682
that they're wrong.

35:37.706 --> 35:40.385
I-I don't understand.
We're just friends.

35:40.409 --> 35:41.886
Why would the police assume

35:41.910 --> 35:44.289
that people
in a platonic relationship

35:44.313 --> 35:45.813
would want to murder someone?

35:48.417 --> 35:50.695
Um...

35:50.719 --> 35:54.399
Um, during the test,
they asked me some questions

35:54.423 --> 35:56.831
about you and, um, us

35:56.855 --> 35:58.833
and whether we had
a relationship

35:58.857 --> 36:01.266
and I said yes,
because it's true.

36:01.290 --> 36:03.668
And then they asked me
something else,

36:03.692 --> 36:06.211
something I hadn't considered.

36:06.235 --> 36:07.712
Which was?

36:07.736 --> 36:11.436
They asked me if I loved you.

36:13.542 --> 36:16.521
What did you say?

36:16.545 --> 36:19.254
I said no.

36:19.278 --> 36:21.186
Oh.

36:21.210 --> 36:23.258
But according to the polygraph,

36:23.282 --> 36:25.282
that wasn't exactly true.

36:28.687 --> 36:31.536
Well, I don't... I don't know
if that means anything.

36:31.560 --> 36:34.539
Polygraphs aren't
completely reliable.

36:34.563 --> 36:39.244
I think perhaps the machine
picked up on something,

36:39.268 --> 36:43.328
something that I wasn't
aware of.

36:45.834 --> 36:46.851
Wow.

36:46.875 --> 36:48.853
What's why I need you
to take the test

36:48.877 --> 36:50.815
and answer
the detective's questions,

36:50.839 --> 36:52.817
because I'm not going to know
exactly how I feel

36:52.841 --> 36:55.189
until we put this behind us,
but then, once we do...

36:55.213 --> 36:57.823
We can move on.

37:07.326 --> 37:09.274
Can those chicorelli sisters
dance or what?

37:09.298 --> 37:11.506
Wow, look out, Broadway!

37:11.530 --> 37:14.609
Now don't forget that we will
have cookies and juice

37:14.633 --> 37:17.812
set up in the basement
after we're done here.

37:17.836 --> 37:19.644
We want to see you all there.
And for our next act,

37:19.668 --> 37:22.216
please welcome
the musical stylings

37:22.240 --> 37:24.319
of Julie and Susan Mayer.

37:27.446 --> 37:29.416
Ow!

37:52.301 --> 37:53.778
I'll be right back.

37:53.802 --> 37:57.882
Oh, um, I'm just gonna need
a couple of seconds,

37:57.906 --> 38:00.376
so feel free to pray.

38:02.311 --> 38:06.631
Edie, the other day when I saw
you making music with my family,

38:06.655 --> 38:08.793
I got a little jealous
and I went a little crazy

38:08.817 --> 38:11.296
and I pushed you out.

38:11.320 --> 38:13.698
Seeing you sitting here today,

38:13.722 --> 38:17.302
well, I can see how much
you care about Julie,

38:17.326 --> 38:21.306
and she comes first,

38:21.330 --> 38:24.479
and it should be you up there
playing with her, not me.

38:24.503 --> 38:27.912
So I'm sorry.

38:27.936 --> 38:29.376
Thank you, Susan.

38:36.585 --> 38:38.963
How convenient
that you decided this

38:38.987 --> 38:41.047
after I showed up
without my guitar.

38:42.751 --> 38:46.070
Well, like I said, I'm sorry.

38:46.094 --> 38:48.433
I wish it could be you up there.

38:48.457 --> 38:49.957
You know, I play piano.

38:53.532 --> 38:55.309
And so let's all welcome
Julie Mayer

38:55.333 --> 38:56.416
and her aunt Edie.

38:57.766 --> 39:00.336
Whoo-hoo!

39:02.110 --> 39:04.088
You did a good thing.

39:04.112 --> 39:07.352
Yeah, well, I try.

39:09.047 --> 39:14.117
♪ This little light of mine ♪

39:17.025 --> 39:22.036
♪ I'm gonna let it shine ♪

39:22.060 --> 39:26.871
♪ This little light of mine ♪

39:26.895 --> 39:32.076
♪ I'm gonna let it shine ♪

39:32.100 --> 39:33.748
Ohh, give me a break.

39:33.772 --> 39:36.681
This thing has, like,
90 flats in it.

39:37.746 --> 39:39.353
Poor Julie.

39:39.377 --> 39:42.427
Stop it. You're loving this.

39:42.451 --> 39:45.690
No, not at all

39:45.714 --> 39:50.465
♪ let it shine, shine, shine ♪

39:50.489 --> 39:55.659
♪ Let it shine ♪

40:07.636 --> 40:11.385
So they said you needed
to see me.

40:11.409 --> 40:13.409
What is it? What's goin' on?

40:15.584 --> 40:21.095
Um, I've been thinking...

40:21.119 --> 40:25.470
You know, about, um...

40:25.494 --> 40:27.741
Everything that happened
with John...

40:27.765 --> 40:31.405
And...

40:31.429 --> 40:32.477
And, um...

40:32.501 --> 40:39.571
I was really selfish and stupid.

40:41.710 --> 40:45.540
And I'm sorry.

40:47.616 --> 40:50.746
I really am sorry.

41:02.731 --> 41:06.191
That's all I had to say, really.

41:08.637 --> 41:11.115
You know what?

41:11.139 --> 41:14.619
That is
the best anniversary gift

41:14.643 --> 41:17.622
that you've ever given me.

41:17.646 --> 41:19.453
Really?

41:19.477 --> 41:21.577
Yeah.

41:23.952 --> 41:27.522
Actually, the one you gave me
is really nice, too.

41:32.521 --> 41:36.170
Everyone enjoys a game
of make-believe now and then.

41:36.194 --> 41:40.144
Of course, the ways in which
we play can vary greatly.

41:40.168 --> 41:44.649
Sometimes we tell ourselves
work won't interfere

41:44.673 --> 41:46.150
with our family life.

41:47.906 --> 41:49.884
Lynette, staff meeting, now.

41:49.908 --> 41:51.756
Yeah.

41:51.780 --> 41:55.820
Sometimes, we imagine
certain relationships

41:55.844 --> 42:00.824
to be more meaningful
than they really are.

42:02.951 --> 42:05.670
Occasionally, we put on a show,

42:05.694 --> 42:08.673
as if to convince ourselves
our secrets

42:08.697 --> 42:13.007
aren't really all that terrible.

42:13.031 --> 42:18.142
Yes, the game of make-believe
is a simple one.

42:18.166 --> 42:20.514
Did you know Rex Van De Kamp?

42:20.538 --> 42:21.816
Yes.

42:21.840 --> 42:26.120
Did Mrs. Van De Kamp
ask you to poison her husband?

42:26.144 --> 42:28.522
No.

42:28.546 --> 42:31.626
Did you poison Rex Van De Kamp?

42:31.650 --> 42:33.698
You start by lying
to yourself...

42:33.722 --> 42:35.282
No.

42:38.556 --> 42:42.867
And if you can getothers
to believe those lies...

42:42.891 --> 42:44.891
You win.
