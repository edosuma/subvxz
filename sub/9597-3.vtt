00:27.007 --> 00:28.907
Stop!

01:03.924 --> 01:05.358
Careful.

01:05.393 --> 01:06.894
Okay.

01:10.733 --> 01:12.801
This is truly magnificent.

01:12.836 --> 01:14.871
I don't know what to say.

01:14.905 --> 01:15.771
I do ... yuck.

01:17.273 --> 01:19.676
Cavanaugh's gonna kill you for
dragging this hunk of junk in here.

01:19.710 --> 01:21.544
This is a Gia Dupont original.

01:21.578 --> 01:23.680
I should've brought you
to more museums.

01:23.715 --> 01:25.616
Then maybe
you'd appreciate art.

01:25.651 --> 01:28.419
What, so a decomposing pinto
is art?

01:28.453 --> 01:29.820
Least you bought american.

01:29.854 --> 01:31.721
You know,
I bet you could've gotten

01:31.756 --> 01:32.956
a Ted Williams original
for what you spent.

01:32.990 --> 01:34.290
I don't know that artist.

01:36.026 --> 01:38.026
He drove a home run 502 feet
into the bleachers at fenway.

01:38.060 --> 01:41.996
You put that ball on display,
you'd have grown men weeping.

01:45.099 --> 01:46.933
Ohh! It's too bad we have a case.

01:46.967 --> 01:49.936
- I could stare at this for hours.
- Me too.

01:50.672 --> 01:52.372
Don't touch.

<b>3x03 - This Is How the Heart Breaks</b>

02:27.798 --> 02:29.565
I hate taggers.

02:29.600 --> 02:31.801
That's not tagging.
It's graffiti.

02:31.835 --> 02:34.237
- Same thing.
- No, it is not.

02:34.272 --> 02:37.774
Wow. What a powerful
piece of street art.

02:37.808 --> 02:40.476
What a powerful example
of felony vandalism.

02:40.510 --> 02:42.911
Jane, this is contemporary art.

02:42.945 --> 02:45.280
Says the woman who paid
$50,000 for old pinto parts.

02:46.749 --> 02:48.450
Banksy's street art
starts at $100,000.

02:49.185 --> 02:50.519
You don't know who that is.

02:50.553 --> 02:52.054
Yes, I do.
He's an urban artist.

02:52.089 --> 02:54.056
And I wouldn't pay
for his old pinto parts, either.

02:54.091 --> 02:55.558
- Frankie?
- Yeah?

02:55.592 --> 02:57.060
Come take photos
of all this vandalism

02:57.094 --> 02:58.961
for the graffiti task force,
all right?

02:58.996 --> 03:00.229
You got it.

03:02.199 --> 03:03.933
He a witness?

03:03.967 --> 03:06.135
Says he was working late in
his gallery, heard some yelling.

03:06.169 --> 03:08.203
I just thought it was
a couple of homeless vets,

03:08.237 --> 03:10.172
you know, squabbling
over a shopping cart.

03:10.206 --> 03:11.807
Why were you working late?

03:11.841 --> 03:15.578
I'm preparing
for a big showing of my art.

03:15.612 --> 03:17.514
Oh. Detective Rizzoli
would want to attend that.

03:17.548 --> 03:18.848
She's a budding art enthusiast.

03:18.882 --> 03:20.783
- For real?
- For not real.

03:20.817 --> 03:22.084
Wh... go help Korsak.

03:22.119 --> 03:24.753
We just saw this
in a different medium.

03:24.787 --> 03:26.021
You've seen my work?

03:26.055 --> 03:27.790
So, you're admitting
to felony vandalism?

03:27.824 --> 03:31.126
No. I did not put those...
posters up.

03:31.161 --> 03:32.661
We catch you
defacing property,

03:32.696 --> 03:34.730
you won't have another
art show, okay, pal?

03:37.267 --> 03:41.371
Survived Fallujah
to die in the streets of Boston.

03:43.975 --> 03:47.411
Victim is Bernard Avery, 29.

03:47.445 --> 03:49.613
He's still warm.
Rigor hasn't presented.

03:49.648 --> 03:51.882
Some nasty wounds.

03:51.917 --> 03:54.785
Vultures go through his stuff already?

03:54.819 --> 03:56.554
Sad.

03:56.588 --> 03:58.723
We've got about 300 homeless
vets on the streets of Boston.

03:58.757 --> 04:00.158
Sharp-force trauma ...

04:00.192 --> 04:02.160
Chop wounds,
puncture wounds.

04:02.194 --> 04:04.128
Well, hey, look at you. Bold.

04:04.163 --> 04:06.064
You ready to call the weapons?

04:06.098 --> 04:07.766
- You thinking two weapons?
- Maybe two killers.

04:07.800 --> 04:10.802
No, there's only
one set of shoe impressions.

04:12.672 --> 04:13.806
Right.

04:13.840 --> 04:19.011
Those couldn't possibly be
bloody footprints.

04:19.045 --> 04:21.279
<i>Rondo! Yo!
Vanilla! Over here!</i>

04:21.314 --> 04:22.847
<i>Come on, man!</i>

04:22.882 --> 04:24.115
<i>Rondo!
Come back here!</i>

04:24.150 --> 04:25.984
I got a tip on your murder,

04:26.018 --> 04:28.720
but your 5-0 bro trying to act
like we ain't even family here!

04:28.754 --> 04:29.921
What's up?

04:33.526 --> 04:35.193
This better be good, Rondo.

04:35.227 --> 04:38.229
You are gonna want to promote
me to homicide, Vanilla.

04:38.263 --> 04:40.731
One of my C.I.S knows
who the killer is.

04:40.765 --> 04:41.898
Wh...
how many you got?

04:41.933 --> 04:44.634
As many as you need, baby.

04:44.668 --> 04:46.902
Yo, Justin.

04:46.937 --> 04:49.305
- General Rondo.
- Perimeter's clear, my man.

04:49.973 --> 04:51.040
"General"?

04:51.074 --> 04:53.075
You sure she's not Taliban, sir?

04:53.110 --> 04:55.111
You can trust her.
She works for me.

04:55.145 --> 04:57.079
- Don't you, private?
- Wh...

04:57.113 --> 04:58.948
Work with me, Vanilla.

05:00.150 --> 05:04.620
Yes. General Rondo here...

05:04.654 --> 05:06.622
tells me that you can I.D. the killer?

05:06.656 --> 05:08.957
Lance Corporal Justin Brown,
ma'am. Yes, I can.

05:08.992 --> 05:10.959
Sergeant Avery was K.I.A.'d

05:10.994 --> 05:14.662
by an insurgent...
dressed in force recon.

05:16.949 --> 05:20.351
Take this.
It contains classified intel.

05:21.386 --> 05:22.653
Really?

05:22.687 --> 05:23.887
I'm telling you ...
he saw something.

05:23.921 --> 05:26.155
The kid was a marine special ops.

05:27.892 --> 05:29.225
I got you, my man.

05:30.261 --> 05:32.495
Your intel is safe with me.

05:40.206 --> 05:41.907
Man, homicide's hard-up.

05:41.941 --> 05:43.708
Economy's getting to
you, too, huh, Vanilla?

05:43.743 --> 05:46.012
You know what? When you
bring me a real witness,

05:46.046 --> 05:47.513
I'll bring you some real money.

05:58.590 --> 06:01.925
Centimeter and a half deep.
Help me turn him over.

06:01.960 --> 06:03.026
Mm-hmm.

06:05.930 --> 06:07.463
So, let's see.

06:07.498 --> 06:10.032
Stab wounds, bruises, gashes ...

06:10.067 --> 06:11.368
that could be
three different weapons.

06:11.402 --> 06:13.236
Not necessarily.

06:13.271 --> 06:15.406
The bruises here were likely
caused by a rounded instrument.

06:15.440 --> 06:18.309
Yeah, that could be
from the handle of a hammer.

06:18.343 --> 06:20.211
The stab wounds
could be from the claw,

06:20.245 --> 06:22.180
but it doesn't explain
these massive gashes.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.283
The gashes are consistent
with a cleaver.

06:25.251 --> 06:30.122
Or an... ax.
Maura...

06:30.157 --> 06:34.293
What if the murder weapon
had an ax on one side

06:34.327 --> 06:38.064
and, like, a narrow spike
on the other?

06:38.099 --> 06:39.466
What does that look like?

06:39.500 --> 06:41.135
Does that look like
a tomahawk to you?

06:41.169 --> 06:43.337
Well, there hasn't been
a murder in Boston by tomahawk

06:43.372 --> 06:45.940
since the Pequot tribe
attacked the colonists.

06:45.975 --> 06:47.508
Yeah, but our victim is a vet.
He's a marine.

06:47.542 --> 06:50.011
They issue tactical
tomahawks to marines.

06:50.045 --> 06:51.879
Would that explain these injuries?

06:51.913 --> 06:53.848
Got a fresh one for you, Dr. Isles.

06:53.882 --> 06:56.183
Guy collapsed in a cab
on his way to Logan.

06:56.217 --> 06:57.317
EMTs pronounced him.

06:57.352 --> 06:59.653
Put him on this table.
Thank you.

06:59.688 --> 07:02.122
Dennis Rockmond, 37.

07:07.028 --> 07:09.997
Ooh. Kind of hot ...
for a dead guy.

07:10.932 --> 07:12.265
Hmm.

07:14.968 --> 07:16.035
Maura.

07:16.069 --> 07:18.637
- Maura!
- What?

07:25.212 --> 07:28.680
- His penis has a pulse.
- Oh, my go... he's alive!

07:32.184 --> 07:34.366
He has an obstruction
in his airway, 

07:34.410 --> 07:36.277
it might be a bronchospasm.
Where are the EMTs?!

07:36.311 --> 07:37.312
How far away are you?

07:37.346 --> 07:39.214
Five minutes.
Maura, do something.

07:39.248 --> 07:40.816
Look, someone needs to perform
a cricothyrotomy.

07:40.850 --> 07:42.151
Oh. What about you?

07:42.185 --> 07:44.153
You're here.
You could do it.

07:44.187 --> 07:46.489
- Find me a slender tube.
- Where?

07:46.523 --> 07:48.124
- In the drawer.
- You have a lot of drawers.

07:48.158 --> 07:50.760
Any tube that can create
an airway ... a-a straw.

07:50.794 --> 07:52.595
Straw.
You want a milkshake?

07:54.564 --> 07:56.899
- I need a tube!
- Okay! Okay! Um, okay.

07:57.567 --> 07:59.268
Pen. I got it!
I got a pen!

07:59.302 --> 08:01.270
Oh, god.
I hate working on live people.

08:01.304 --> 08:03.572
- What if I kill him again?
- Maura, just do it.

08:03.607 --> 08:04.807
Okay.

08:11.614 --> 08:13.215
Oh, come on. Come on.

08:14.150 --> 08:16.518
Maura, look.
I think you did it.

08:19.288 --> 08:21.622
You're okay.
You're alive.

08:25.260 --> 08:27.594
2 milligrams Salbutamol.
He's having bronchospasms.

08:33.134 --> 08:34.634
Well, that was exciting.

08:34.668 --> 08:36.302
You think we should bump fists?

08:38.438 --> 08:42.442
Oh. It is nice to save
someone that handsome.

08:42.476 --> 08:43.744
Wha... really?

08:43.778 --> 08:45.612
So if he was ugly,
you would have let him die?

08:45.647 --> 08:47.181
Of course not.

08:47.215 --> 08:51.352
Listen, get to work
on this other dead guy, okay?

08:51.386 --> 08:54.155
Oh, Maura, check his pulse first.

09:00.363 --> 09:03.299
Well, I think our murder weapon
may be a tactical tomahawk.

09:03.333 --> 09:05.635
- We had them in 'Nam.
- To cut through the jungle?

09:05.669 --> 09:07.103
Pshh.
To cut through people.

09:07.137 --> 09:08.637
Maybe our victim had a tomahawk.

09:08.672 --> 09:10.606
The military started
reissuing them in 2004.

09:10.640 --> 09:12.508
Well, let's check his records.

09:12.542 --> 09:15.511
Hey, I heard you and Dr. Isles
brought a zombie back to life.

09:15.545 --> 09:17.380
How'd you know?

09:17.414 --> 09:20.583
- News like that travels.
- Yeah ... hard and fast.

09:22.252 --> 09:24.787
Does the fascination with
your ding-a-lings ever end?

09:24.821 --> 09:26.622
- Nope.
- Nope.

09:28.158 --> 09:30.293
I hope we're not looking
at a vet-on-vet murder.

09:30.327 --> 09:32.228
Here's Bernard's military record.

09:33.430 --> 09:35.031
It's clean. Right there ...

09:35.065 --> 09:36.499
three combat tours,
honorably discharged.

09:36.533 --> 09:39.068
Any arrests since he's been back?

09:39.102 --> 09:40.736
Trespassing, couple of street fights,

09:40.771 --> 09:44.006
public drinking, and disorderly.
No convictions, though.

09:44.041 --> 09:45.441
We got any pictures
of his marine squad?

09:45.475 --> 09:47.043
Yeah.

09:47.077 --> 09:48.711
There he is ...
holding his tomahawk.

09:48.745 --> 09:51.046
If he brought it back,
it wasn't in his shopping cart.

09:51.081 --> 09:53.348
Zoom in on the guy on his right.

09:54.450 --> 09:57.286
That looks like Rondo's C.I. Justin.

09:57.320 --> 09:59.088
Lance Corporal Justin Brown.

09:59.122 --> 10:01.190
Got his tomahawk strapped on.

10:01.225 --> 10:03.526
Yeah, we got our first suspect.
Print that.

10:03.560 --> 10:05.361
Bernard Avery's widow's
here to see you guys.

10:05.396 --> 10:07.697
Korsak, come on.

10:07.731 --> 10:11.534
Come on, Frankie. Come help
me pick up a murder suspect.

10:11.569 --> 10:16.907
Do you recognize any of the
other men in your husband's squad?

10:18.176 --> 10:22.679
That's Justin...
his best friend.

10:22.714 --> 10:24.648
A lot of his squad was from home.

10:24.682 --> 10:27.217
Makes it harder if you have to...

10:27.251 --> 10:28.551
see them die.

10:29.753 --> 10:31.788
Is that what happened
on the third tour?

10:31.823 --> 10:36.626
They were on patrol.
They only had a week left.

10:36.661 --> 10:40.397
And there was a suicide
bomber who blew himself up.

10:40.431 --> 10:44.201
- A lot of them died.
- I'm sorry.

10:44.235 --> 10:50.475
When Bernard came home, he
barely spoke, except to Justin.

10:50.509 --> 10:53.612
He tried to get a job,
but he was diagnosed with PTSD.

10:53.646 --> 10:55.347
Was he treated for it?

10:55.382 --> 10:58.651
A friend
from my wives support group

10:58.685 --> 11:01.321
told me about this outreach center.

11:03.124 --> 11:05.326
- Did it help?
- It seemed like it.

11:06.361 --> 11:08.996
But he was kicked out
after a couple weeks.

11:10.165 --> 11:12.666
Did your husband come
back with any weapons?

11:14.135 --> 11:15.802
A tomahawk.

11:18.606 --> 11:22.375
- Is that what killed him?
- Maybe.

11:22.410 --> 11:25.378
I begged him to get rid of it.

11:25.412 --> 11:28.147
It scared me, it scared our son.

11:28.181 --> 11:30.816
But he said
he didn't feel safe without it.

11:32.152 --> 11:34.253
When did your husband
become homeless?

11:35.722 --> 11:37.956
About six months ago,
after one of his nightmares.

11:39.792 --> 11:42.827
He thought that there was
a suicide bomber in the house.

11:44.296 --> 11:48.265
He was looking
for his sniper rifle.

11:48.300 --> 11:51.569
- He said he had to kill him.
- Kill who?

11:51.603 --> 11:55.706
Ki...
kill our son.

11:58.777 --> 12:01.479
I knew I could lose him over there.

12:02.715 --> 12:05.917
I never thought I'd lose him
when he finally came home.

12:15.228 --> 12:17.129
I didn't know
you lost friends in Vietnam.

12:17.164 --> 12:20.066
I don't like to talk about it.
People don't like to hear it.

12:20.100 --> 12:23.203
What happened when you
approached the checkpoint?

12:23.237 --> 12:25.773
An I.E.D. went off ...
right in front of the Humvee.

12:28.843 --> 12:30.076
My sergeant's hit.

12:30.111 --> 12:32.479
Wow.
Virtual-reality therapy.

12:32.513 --> 12:34.247
We're taking fire.

12:34.282 --> 12:36.616
- It feels too real.
- But it isn't, Marlon.

12:36.650 --> 12:38.751
What you're seeing
is a virtual simulation,

12:38.786 --> 12:40.753
and this is
rob's experience in Iraq.

12:40.788 --> 12:42.622
It's not yours.
Yours will be different.

12:44.157 --> 12:46.325
Dude, it's bad at first,
but it gets a lot easier.

12:46.359 --> 12:49.361
- I don't know.
- Look, confronting your fears ...

12:52.198 --> 12:55.434
Rob, why don't you take Marlon
and go grab a cup of coffee?

12:56.369 --> 12:57.837
I'm Dr. Bacal.
How can I help you?

12:57.871 --> 12:59.472
Uh, Boston homicide.

12:59.506 --> 13:01.674
We'd like to ask you some
questions about Bernard Avery.

13:01.708 --> 13:04.410
Please don't tell me Bernard's
been involved in a homicide.

13:04.444 --> 13:06.446
Actually, he is the homicide.

13:06.480 --> 13:09.449
We found him hacked to death
in an alley this morning.

13:09.483 --> 13:10.851
What can you tell us about him?

13:10.885 --> 13:14.521
Um, not much. I, uh..
I tried to work with him,

13:14.556 --> 13:17.057
but he was suspicious
about psychologists.

13:17.091 --> 13:19.393
I had one of our vets, a Lieutenant
Colonel, work with him, as well.

13:19.427 --> 13:21.161
Uh, can we speak with him, please?

13:21.196 --> 13:23.564
Sure.

13:23.598 --> 13:25.365
Come in.

13:25.400 --> 13:28.468
Colonel, I have two detectives
here to talk about Bernard Avery.

13:28.502 --> 13:29.602
Sure.

13:32.172 --> 13:34.406
Colonel Jones!
How are you, sir?

13:34.441 --> 13:35.541
No complaints.

13:39.378 --> 13:42.113
Except I've got a sprained
ankle. You mind if I sit?

13:42.148 --> 13:44.115
No, please.

13:44.149 --> 13:47.485
- Hello, Jane.
- Hello, Colonel.

13:49.322 --> 13:51.289
Uh, we're here, uh...

13:51.324 --> 13:53.592
investigating the
murder of Bernard Avery.

13:54.660 --> 13:57.495
Well, damn.
What happened?

13:57.530 --> 13:59.297
Why was he kicked out of this program?

13:59.331 --> 14:00.831
We had no choice.

14:00.866 --> 14:04.068
We, uh, we had a new patient ...
a marine from Bernard's unit.

14:04.103 --> 14:06.237
They got into a physical fight

14:06.272 --> 14:08.040
over something
that happened in Fallujah.

14:08.074 --> 14:10.008
I had to ask them both to leave.

14:10.042 --> 14:11.643
Was his name Justin Brown?

14:11.678 --> 14:15.880
No. His name is Tyler Moore
... lives at the vet center.

14:18.784 --> 14:20.552
Thank you, Colonel.
Appreciate the help.

14:20.586 --> 14:21.553
Anytime.

14:24.357 --> 14:27.559
Um, can you...
can you give me a minute?

14:27.593 --> 14:30.928
Sure.
I'll pull the car around.

14:35.300 --> 14:37.568
- What the hell, Casey?
- Jane ...

14:37.603 --> 14:40.271
- How long have you been back?
- A few months.

14:40.605 --> 14:44.542
And ... and you did...
you couldn't ...

14:44.576 --> 14:45.810
I've been really busy with
the veterans center and the...

14:45.844 --> 14:49.346
Oh. No. 'Cause the last
time that we talked...

14:49.381 --> 14:50.714
I told you
I was on a covert assignment,

14:50.749 --> 14:52.483
wasn't allowed to tell
you where I was sent.

14:52.517 --> 14:55.519
- Operation south Boston?
- It's a little complicated.

14:55.554 --> 14:57.855
- Try me.
- Things have changed, Jane.

14:57.889 --> 14:59.657
But it's good to see you.

15:01.526 --> 15:03.460
Can you close the door
on your way out?

15:08.499 --> 15:12.069
Yes, it's good to see you, too.

15:28.698 --> 15:29.698
Hi.

15:29.732 --> 15:33.068
The cute boy with the erection is
being discharged from the hospital.

15:33.102 --> 15:34.636
He sent me these orchids.

15:34.670 --> 15:37.238
Good. I wish him and his
wang a speedy recovery.

15:38.107 --> 15:41.976
- What's the matter?
- I saw Casey.

15:42.010 --> 15:46.614
- What? Where? When?
- H-he's back... in Boston.

15:46.648 --> 15:49.184
Actually ... actually,
he's been here for a while.

15:49.218 --> 15:51.119
Jane, I'm so sorry.

15:54.956 --> 15:58.459
Oh, my god. Did you
like him more than Dean?

15:59.994 --> 16:01.695
You did, didn't you?

16:01.729 --> 16:06.033
I've been waiting for him to get
back from Afghanistan, and...

16:06.067 --> 16:08.635
And he did.

16:08.670 --> 16:11.705
- What did he say?
- "Good to see you."

16:11.739 --> 16:15.608
- Uh-oh. That's bad.
- Maura.

16:15.643 --> 16:16.509
Ow! Ow!

16:16.544 --> 16:17.877
You want a real "ow"?

16:17.912 --> 16:20.280
Wait till your zombie says,
"oh, I'm really busy."

16:22.816 --> 16:25.985
- Maybe that's him.
- It's Korsak.

16:26.019 --> 16:29.521
He has our suspect in interroga...
I can't focus.

16:29.556 --> 16:30.923
Go interrogate.

16:30.957 --> 16:33.993
Studies show that the best antidote
for heartbreak is distraction.

16:34.928 --> 16:38.431
Okay. The only reason that I'm
going is because if I don't,

16:38.465 --> 16:40.599
I'm afraid I'm gonna spend
the rest of my life

16:40.634 --> 16:42.701
curled up in the fetal position
on your couch.

16:42.736 --> 16:45.104
And your couch blows.

16:52.045 --> 16:53.780
Hello, Tyler.

16:53.814 --> 16:55.681
Private first class Tyler Moore,
United States marine corps.

16:55.716 --> 17:00.086
- Semper Fi.
- I didn't kill Bernard.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.588
Tyler, you're not a suspect,
but we would like to know

17:02.622 --> 17:04.022
why there was bad blood
between you.

17:04.057 --> 17:07.659
It's 'cause of what he did.
Or didn't do.

17:07.694 --> 17:11.663
- What didn't he do?
- We were on patrol.

17:11.696 --> 17:14.665
Bernard was covering our advance.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.800
He saw the suicide bomber
coming right toward us.

17:16.836 --> 17:19.872
- He didn't take the shot.
- Is that what put you in that chair?

17:21.241 --> 17:22.375
Yeah.

17:23.711 --> 17:27.314
Killed six guys. And Bernard
came home without a scratch.

17:27.348 --> 17:29.917
And if I wasn't in this chair,
I would've killed him.

17:29.951 --> 17:32.987
What about Justin Brown?
Does he feel the same way?

17:33.021 --> 17:36.557
Justin's brains were scrambled.
They were buddies.

17:36.591 --> 17:38.459
I hope they both go to hell.

17:38.493 --> 17:40.061
It won't make the pain
go away, Tyler.

17:41.230 --> 17:43.131
Excuse me.

17:47.069 --> 17:48.302
What's up, Frost?

17:48.336 --> 17:50.070
We found Justin.

17:50.105 --> 17:52.106
<i>Is he still saying that Bernard
was murdered by insurgents?</i>

17:52.140 --> 17:54.208
He's not saying anything,
Jane.

17:55.543 --> 17:56.810
He's dead.

17:59.847 --> 18:03.184
Justin's injuries
are similar to Bernard's.

18:05.821 --> 18:08.924
So they were both killed
with a tactical tomahawk.

18:08.959 --> 18:11.794
You're fixated on Casey.
Why don't you just talk to him?

18:11.829 --> 18:14.498
I would rather
juggle your scalpels.

18:14.532 --> 18:16.634
- Don't you want to know?
- Oh, I know ... it's over.

18:16.668 --> 18:18.703
The University of Missouri
researchers do say

18:18.737 --> 18:20.771
that men avoid
intimate conversations, anyway.

18:20.806 --> 18:22.439
Really?
What a surprising outcome.

18:22.474 --> 18:24.675
He doesn't deserve you, Jane.

18:25.911 --> 18:27.678
Can you please distract me

18:27.713 --> 18:30.282
with some sort
of scientific mumbo jumbo?

18:31.651 --> 18:33.151
You see the scarring
in Bernard's lungs?

18:33.186 --> 18:35.521
I'm doing more testing,
but it could be war lung.

18:35.555 --> 18:37.055
We're seeing it in a lot of soldiers.

18:37.090 --> 18:39.251
Think of all the sad things
we'd avoid if men would

18:39.346 --> 18:42.128
just talk about their problems
instead of going to war.

18:42.163 --> 18:46.265
Here are Justin's lungs.
Huh. No sign of war lung.

18:46.368 --> 18:47.935
Well,
that doesn't make any sense.

18:47.969 --> 18:50.305
They served together, so they'd
be exposed to the same toxins.

18:50.339 --> 18:52.407
- Shouldn't they both have it?
- Yeah.

18:57.513 --> 19:00.915
Our medical miracle is
here to thank us. Come on.

19:00.950 --> 19:04.885
Ugh. I'm keeping my distance.
I'm afraid of that erection.

19:08.689 --> 19:12.592
He's a little sexier alive.

19:12.626 --> 19:14.727
Hello. I'm Dr. Isles.

19:14.761 --> 19:16.762
I remember you.

19:17.831 --> 19:19.064
Are you checking his pulse?

19:20.300 --> 19:22.669
Thank you for saving my life.

19:23.370 --> 19:24.471
And you, too, detective.

19:24.505 --> 19:26.606
No way.
I'm... not a hugger.

19:26.641 --> 19:30.311
Oh. Okay.
Well, this is for you.

19:30.345 --> 19:31.646
Thank you.

19:31.680 --> 19:34.215
Well, I heard what you did
for me with that pen.

19:34.250 --> 19:35.584
Quick recovery.
How's your throat?

19:35.618 --> 19:38.754
It's a little sore.
Otherwise, I feel great.

19:39.489 --> 19:41.589
How did you get a Gia Dupont?

19:41.624 --> 19:44.459
Why? Are you shocked to
see such a contemporary

19:44.460 --> 19:47.294
masterpiece in a lowly police station?

19:47.329 --> 19:48.829
No.

19:48.863 --> 19:50.898
You should be, because I'd
like to dismantle it for parts.

19:50.932 --> 19:53.267
Official police business
coming through.

19:53.301 --> 19:54.668
Uh, excuse me.

20:02.443 --> 20:04.344
Damn shame about Justin.

20:04.379 --> 20:07.247
Yeah, I'm sorry, Rondo.
Who's this?

20:07.281 --> 20:10.350
Oh, this is Sour Grapes,
another one of my C.I.S.

20:10.384 --> 20:11.751
We go way back.

20:11.785 --> 20:13.686
I played the blues with this dude.

20:13.721 --> 20:15.655
He could sing the panties
right off ya.

20:15.689 --> 20:18.625
Boston's Barry White...
right here.

20:18.659 --> 20:20.227
That was another life.

20:20.261 --> 20:23.564
Hey, hey.
You're Raymond Washington.

20:23.598 --> 20:25.833
Oh, my god, Jane.

20:25.867 --> 20:29.305
- It's true about the panties.
- Ma.

20:29.339 --> 20:33.309
Your father and I used to go see
him all the time at the Beehive.

20:33.343 --> 20:36.312
Tommy was conceived when ...
No, I think it was Frankie.

20:36.346 --> 20:38.981
Ma. Could we get these
gentlemen some coffee?

20:39.015 --> 20:40.649
Sure ...

20:40.684 --> 20:43.485
I'd prefer a glass of Shiraz
and a doughnut.

20:43.520 --> 20:46.421
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
Delish.

20:46.456 --> 20:48.323
Rondo, are you checking out
my mother's ...

20:48.357 --> 20:51.592
I see the apple bottom doesn't
fall far from the Rizzoli tree.

20:51.627 --> 20:52.760
- Stop.
- Okay.

20:54.146 --> 20:55.079
What did you see?

20:55.113 --> 20:57.381
- He killed Justin.
- Who?

20:57.415 --> 21:00.084
Pope John Paul.
Think it's the second one.

21:02.755 --> 21:05.591
You understand that "C.I." does
not mean "crazy individual"?

21:05.625 --> 21:07.626
It stands for
"confidential informant,"

21:07.661 --> 21:11.097
which means he provides
information to solve a homicide.

21:11.131 --> 21:13.299
But there's something here,
Vanilla.

21:13.334 --> 21:16.770
- I-I just don't know what it is.
- Okay.

21:18.906 --> 21:21.474
So, you're saying the man
you saw looked like the pope?

21:21.508 --> 21:26.345
No, I'm saying he is the pope,
cruising around in his popemobile...

21:26.379 --> 21:28.480
taking out homeless folks.

21:28.515 --> 21:30.516
It's nice to meet you, grapes.

21:30.550 --> 21:32.517
Whoa, whoa! Wait, wait!
T-that's it.

21:32.552 --> 21:33.986
There's this white dude ...

21:34.020 --> 21:36.655
self-appointed sheriff
of homeless town.

21:36.689 --> 21:39.558
He reminds me of that pope, too.

21:39.593 --> 21:40.993
Okay. Okay.
I'll check it out.

21:41.027 --> 21:44.897
Oh, hey.
Check this out, too.

21:44.931 --> 21:47.533
I got me a gut feeling
it means something.

21:47.567 --> 21:50.537
Justin's intel.
I'll check it out

21:50.571 --> 21:52.606
if you promise to sing for me
one day, Barry White.

21:52.640 --> 21:55.609
No. No, no.
I am not making that promise.

21:57.612 --> 22:00.046
Okay, well, give it to me.
I'll look into it.

22:03.116 --> 22:06.952
Okay?
Thank you, Rondo.

22:13.576 --> 22:17.313
It's beautiful.
Who's the artist? 

22:17.347 --> 22:19.015
Um... me.

22:19.049 --> 22:23.186
I call it "the healing hand."
Seems fitting to give it to you.

22:23.220 --> 22:24.287
Thank you.

22:24.322 --> 22:27.391
Sculpting's just a hobby.
I actually talk for a living.

22:27.425 --> 22:29.260
Oh, I-I-I know ...

22:29.294 --> 22:32.130
"unleash your inner real winning self."

22:34.033 --> 22:36.402
I, um...
I googled you.

22:38.071 --> 22:40.540
Well, then I guess you know
I was heading to Akron

22:40.574 --> 22:43.042
for a speaking engagement
before all this.

22:43.076 --> 22:45.411
Your vocal folds
are only temporarily inflamed.

22:45.445 --> 22:47.146
You likely had too much inderal.

22:47.180 --> 22:49.715
Wait.
How did you find that on google?

22:51.017 --> 22:52.484
Oh.

22:52.519 --> 22:55.087
Well, I-I-I had to look at
your, you know, medical records,

22:55.121 --> 22:57.556
uh, you know, just to, uh...
just fill out your paperwork,

22:57.590 --> 23:01.293
so...

23:01.327 --> 23:02.927
Do you have plans tonight?

23:02.961 --> 23:04.162
Um...

23:04.196 --> 23:05.530
Can I buy you dinner?

23:05.564 --> 23:08.299
If you promise
not to die on me again.

23:09.435 --> 23:11.203
- That's a deal.
- Okay.

23:12.538 --> 23:14.005
So, 7:00?

23:14.040 --> 23:16.142
Yeah.
I'll see you then.

23:16.176 --> 23:17.577
- Okay.
- Okay.

23:19.213 --> 23:20.480
Oh. Excuse me.

23:23.084 --> 23:25.052
- Angela.
- Who was that?

23:26.254 --> 23:28.255
Look what I made ...

23:28.290 --> 23:31.359
<i>Cannoncini
alla crema pasticcera.</i>

23:31.393 --> 23:33.395
Yum.

23:33.429 --> 23:36.565
I wish Jane could meet
a tall drink of water like that.

23:36.599 --> 23:39.701
Maybe if she learned
how to make puff pastry...

23:39.736 --> 23:43.205
Oh. I know. Especially after
what happened with Casey.

23:44.407 --> 23:46.241
Start talking.

23:47.310 --> 23:49.578
Hey, we know
any neighborhood watch guys

23:49.612 --> 23:50.979
that look like the pope?

23:51.014 --> 23:53.415
- Benedict?
- No, John Paul II.

23:53.449 --> 23:55.350
I got a witness who says

23:55.384 --> 23:57.585
he saw our suspect
rousting homeless guys.

23:57.619 --> 24:00.054
We have all the neighborhood
watch volunteers on file.

24:00.088 --> 24:01.255
Let's look.

24:04.158 --> 24:08.028
Can you do a split-screen
of a picture of that guy

24:08.063 --> 24:09.230
and one of the pope?

24:09.264 --> 24:11.232
Jeff Miller.

24:13.670 --> 24:14.536
Hmm.

24:14.571 --> 24:18.474
- See what he drives.
- Pulling his DMV record.

24:20.910 --> 24:24.513
Drives a white Dodge van
with a bubble-top sunroof.

24:24.547 --> 24:27.650
Your witness say that the bad
guy drove the popemobile, too?

24:27.684 --> 24:29.251
Why, yes, he did.

24:29.286 --> 24:32.621
Maybe Jeff Miller went
from volunteer to vigilante.

24:41.063 --> 24:43.131
All this
reminds me of an agora.

24:43.165 --> 24:47.302
- An ancient Greek marketplace.
- Not many people know that.

24:47.336 --> 24:52.639
Oh! I bet you the Greeks didn't
have chili dogs like these.

24:52.674 --> 24:54.241
These are the best in Boston.

24:54.275 --> 24:56.042
You know, hot dogs are made

24:56.076 --> 24:58.978
from the gonads, intestines,
and eyeballs of hooved animals.

24:59.012 --> 25:01.580
Well...
they're still amazing.

25:01.614 --> 25:03.182
Okay, fine.

25:03.216 --> 25:04.950
Let's take a look at the art first.

25:04.985 --> 25:06.252
Okay.

25:06.286 --> 25:07.954
I'm sorry.

25:07.988 --> 25:09.621
No.

25:12.592 --> 25:13.925
Wow.

25:13.960 --> 25:16.161
What an exceptional piece.

25:16.196 --> 25:19.598
And you have exceptional hands.

25:20.500 --> 25:22.168
I would love to sculpt them.

25:24.237 --> 25:27.439
What's the wildest, most
outrageous thing you've ever done?

25:27.473 --> 25:30.441
Umm... hmm.

25:30.476 --> 25:35.612
I... I rode nude on a horse
at an equine dressage event.

25:35.647 --> 25:37.413
Wow.

25:37.448 --> 25:40.817
Well, I was protesting budget
cuts to my college equestrian team.

25:42.286 --> 25:44.053
Come on.

25:44.088 --> 25:47.624
I think it's time for you to do
something outrageous again.

25:47.659 --> 25:49.226
What?

25:57.002 --> 25:59.371
- That's impressive.
- Come on.

26:06.212 --> 26:08.881
Oh. Wow.

26:08.915 --> 26:11.282
What a beautiful view of the city.

26:11.317 --> 26:14.185
Hey, be my lookout.

26:14.219 --> 26:15.519
Wha...

26:16.888 --> 26:19.957
No. No, you ... you can't
do that. That's illegal.

26:19.991 --> 26:21.324
Art is not a crime.

26:21.359 --> 26:23.926
Come on.
Take a walk on the wild side.

26:23.961 --> 26:26.196
It's not like
we're killing anyone.

26:27.465 --> 26:29.232
All right.

26:29.266 --> 26:30.366
Take that.

26:30.401 --> 26:32.369
Uh...No, no, no.
I-I-I can't do that.

26:32.403 --> 26:33.836
I-I am
the chief medical examiner

26:33.871 --> 26:35.271
of the commonwealth
of Massachusetts.

26:35.306 --> 26:37.607
Well, tonight,
you are a street artist.

26:42.514 --> 26:44.315
<i>Drop the can!</i>

26:46.218 --> 26:48.520
<i>Hands on top of your head.
Turn around slowly.</i>

26:48.554 --> 26:50.989
Uh-oh.
That's not good.

26:51.023 --> 26:53.325
Oh, you have no idea.

26:59.434 --> 27:01.168
"Get the human trash
off our streets."

27:01.202 --> 27:03.003
I think we found
"Mr. Neighborhood" watch.

27:03.038 --> 27:04.438
Piece of scum!

27:04.472 --> 27:06.240
You leave my people alone.

27:06.274 --> 27:09.175
Keep your jackets on, guys.
I got this.

27:09.210 --> 27:12.145
Hyyyyy...
Unh!

27:12.179 --> 27:13.346
"Hyah" to you, too, dirtbag.

27:13.380 --> 27:15.481
Okay, step back, sir.

27:15.515 --> 27:17.516
Take this homeless sack of junk to jail.

27:17.550 --> 27:19.885
- You okay?
- Can't even feel it.

27:19.919 --> 27:20.985
Where were you two nights ago?

27:21.020 --> 27:22.353
I was doing your job ...

27:22.388 --> 27:23.955
chasing down scum
with citizen crime fighters.

27:23.989 --> 27:25.456
They'll vouch for me.

27:25.491 --> 27:27.458
If you think you're gonna pin
these homeless murders on me,

27:27.493 --> 27:29.861
then you guys
got another think coming.

27:29.895 --> 27:31.179
Okay, so we start with
an arrest for assault

27:31.180 --> 27:32.464
and battery with a dangerous weapon.

27:32.498 --> 27:36.034
- What dangerous weapon?
- That leg is damn dangerous.

27:37.603 --> 27:39.604
Thank you.

27:41.374 --> 27:45.443
- You look nice.
- Thank you.

27:45.478 --> 27:48.179
So, your heart's
on the mend, I guess?

27:48.214 --> 27:50.182
Oh, my go...
Maura told you about Casey?

27:50.216 --> 27:52.451
I can't believe Charles would
treat you like that.

27:52.485 --> 27:53.986
Ma.

27:54.020 --> 27:57.390
I wish you would confide
in me. I-I'm right here.

27:57.424 --> 27:59.759
- Really?
- Really.

28:01.162 --> 28:03.430
I'm thinking of becoming a nun.

28:06.634 --> 28:07.534
Aw, baby.

28:19.172 --> 28:22.074
Why would you tell
my mother about Casey? 

28:22.108 --> 28:23.409
Sorry.
Jane, look!

28:23.443 --> 28:26.413
Oh, okay.
No problem. Not mad.

28:26.447 --> 28:28.848
Why don't you tell her
I got a vibrator, too?

28:28.883 --> 28:30.751
Frankie wrote you up for vandalism?

28:30.785 --> 28:32.519
Maura, you were tagging?

28:32.553 --> 28:34.221
I was with Dennis.

28:34.255 --> 28:36.790
Never date a zombie.
They have no respect for the law.

28:36.825 --> 28:40.194
Jane, I have a confession.
I liked it.

28:41.129 --> 28:43.296
I liked it.
I liked breaking the law.

28:43.331 --> 28:44.831
It made me feel like
who I used to be ...

28:44.866 --> 28:46.634
someone who took chances.

28:46.668 --> 28:48.636
Someone who commits felonies
and can't keep her mouth shut.

28:48.670 --> 28:51.239
- That's great.
- I just said I was sorry.

28:51.273 --> 28:52.473
Sorry to interrupt.

28:52.508 --> 28:54.108
Oh, that's okay ...
we're just discussing

28:54.142 --> 28:56.911
the case of the lovesick,
blabbermouth tagger.

28:56.945 --> 28:58.546
Oh.

28:58.580 --> 29:01.082
You have the results from
Bernard Avery's lung biopsy?

29:01.116 --> 29:02.951
Yes.
It wasn't war lung.

29:04.687 --> 29:08.490
Toluene, acetone,
propane, and butane.

29:08.524 --> 29:09.991
Was he huffing?

29:10.026 --> 29:11.426
No.
It's spray paint.

29:11.460 --> 29:13.261
He was exposed to a lot of it

29:13.296 --> 29:15.531
over the course of months ...
maybe years.

29:15.566 --> 29:16.999
You think Bernard was a tagger?

29:17.034 --> 29:19.268
Maybe that's why
he was in the alley.

29:19.303 --> 29:21.771
- This is a street beef.
- Is that a food truck?

29:21.805 --> 29:25.375
Bernard was spray-painting
over another tagger's.

29:25.409 --> 29:27.377
And he always
had his tomahawk with him.

29:28.612 --> 29:31.448
Well, I wish that I could
help you solve these murders,

29:31.483 --> 29:33.284
but, um...
I'll be in jail.

29:33.318 --> 29:36.654
Give me that.
Use a tomahawk on my brother.

29:40.259 --> 29:41.826
It could be a rival tagger, right?

29:41.860 --> 29:43.127
Yeah.

29:43.162 --> 29:45.830
These are all the graffiti photos
Frankie took at the crime scene.

29:45.864 --> 29:48.765
"Ra nad om."

29:48.800 --> 29:50.534
You think
yogis are tagging now?

29:51.736 --> 29:53.437
It's "random," bro.
It says "random."

29:53.471 --> 29:55.205
"Random." 

29:55.240 --> 29:57.807
Frankie. Get in here.

29:57.842 --> 29:59.976
- Ooh! Am I in trouble?
- Yes.

30:01.211 --> 30:03.346
You're charging the chief
medical examiner with tagging?

30:05.215 --> 30:07.683
Okay, can you two
turn your heads, please?

30:07.717 --> 30:09.084
I need to "hyah" my brother.

30:09.119 --> 30:10.486
It's bogus.
My sergeant was there.

30:10.520 --> 30:12.244
I wrote it up
to get her and her...

30:12.302 --> 30:14.389
boyfriend the hell off the street.

30:14.423 --> 30:16.758
Meant to tell her.
Sorry.

30:16.792 --> 30:18.726
I'll tell her.

30:21.297 --> 30:23.397
Keep seeing this one
over and over ... "penance."

30:23.431 --> 30:24.732
Mm.

30:24.766 --> 30:26.300
There's no match in the graffiti
task force database.

30:26.335 --> 30:28.836
And this one, too ...
"blister."

30:28.870 --> 30:30.638
"Dizzy monocles."

30:30.672 --> 30:33.308
"Dizzy monkey," dude.
Can't you read?

30:33.342 --> 30:34.409
Not graffiti.

30:34.444 --> 30:36.278
"Blister's" name is Steve Bogart.

30:36.312 --> 30:38.848
He was a tagger. Now he's
a documentary filmmaker.

30:38.882 --> 30:41.551
Been shooting Boston's graffiti
scene for the last year.

30:41.585 --> 30:42.785
We ever pick him up?

30:44.422 --> 30:47.490
Doesn't look like it.
Wait. This is interesting.

30:47.525 --> 30:49.793
He's listed on a police report
as a victim.

30:49.827 --> 30:51.528
Of assault and battery.

30:51.562 --> 30:54.397
Look who the assailant was ...
Bernard Avery.

30:54.431 --> 30:56.432
How did we miss that?
We ran Bernard's record.

30:56.466 --> 30:57.700
Bernard wasn't charged.

30:57.734 --> 30:59.769
Steve Bogart refused to prosecute.

30:59.804 --> 31:02.839
Maybe because he wanted
to handle it himself ...

31:02.873 --> 31:04.307
with a tomahawk.

31:04.342 --> 31:06.977
Maybe. I'll get a warrant.
We'll go pick him up.

31:10.247 --> 31:11.714
<i>Let's do this.</i>

31:23.427 --> 31:24.861
- Watch yourself.
- Even with a warrant?

31:24.895 --> 31:26.529
Yeah, when he swings
that tomahawk at your head,

31:26.563 --> 31:28.698
just hold up that piece of paper.

31:28.732 --> 31:30.333
I hate these loft apartments.

31:38.375 --> 31:39.474
Clear!

31:40.477 --> 31:41.878
Clear!

31:45.215 --> 31:48.818
They weren't just looking for something.
They broke all his equipment.

31:51.454 --> 31:54.556
- You hear that?
- Yeah.

31:54.591 --> 31:56.725
It's coming from over there.

31:59.463 --> 31:59.795
Frankie!

32:00.797 --> 32:02.865
Frankie, let's wait
for the hazmat team!

32:03.733 --> 32:04.566
Oh!

32:04.601 --> 32:06.268
Must have...

32:06.303 --> 32:08.471
snuck up and clunked him
over the head.

32:08.505 --> 32:10.339
Didn't even get to drink his beer.

32:10.374 --> 32:11.774
Does it look like Steve Bogart?

32:11.808 --> 32:13.776
Uh...

32:13.810 --> 32:15.878
Looks kind of like
corned beef and cabbage.

32:15.913 --> 32:18.080
Ugh!

32:20.484 --> 32:23.353
I love Humboldt fog.

32:23.388 --> 32:25.655
I'm so glad
that you're not mad at me

32:25.690 --> 32:27.657
for getting you into trouble.

32:29.127 --> 32:30.461
Well, Jane is looking into it for us.

32:30.495 --> 32:32.530
I'm hoping that we can do
community service.

32:32.564 --> 32:35.466
Ah, I wouldn't worry. I know
several prominent defense attorneys.

32:35.500 --> 32:37.902
I hope that's not necessary.

32:37.936 --> 32:43.374
Oh! Um, I-I can turn the
air on if it's warm in here.

32:43.409 --> 32:44.943
Oh. No, it's fine.

32:44.977 --> 32:48.612
Wow. You really do
have good circulation.

32:50.315 --> 32:52.483
I'm sorry. I hope I'm...
not making you uncomfortable.

32:52.517 --> 32:55.085
I just thought that
since I'm asking you to be nude

32:55.120 --> 32:57.988
that, you know...
I should be, too.

33:09.533 --> 33:12.202
Um...

33:12.236 --> 33:14.237
Pablo Picasso did say,
"art is dangerous."

33:16.206 --> 33:19.075
Why not?
We're going to jail anyway.

33:25.549 --> 33:28.250
The skull has gaping wounds ...

33:28.285 --> 33:31.053
likely produced from the
blade of a heavy weapon.

33:31.087 --> 33:34.758
Could it be... from ...
oh, I don't know ...

33:34.865 --> 33:36.424
...a tomahawk?
Just a wild guess.

33:36.458 --> 33:38.626
Well, perhaps
I could confirm the weapon

33:38.660 --> 33:41.328
if you told me what
my future wardrobe is ...

33:41.363 --> 33:44.465
forest-green jumpsuit
for my prison stay

33:44.499 --> 33:45.666
or the fluorescent orange

33:45.701 --> 33:47.569
for my court-mandated
trash-collecting?

33:47.603 --> 33:49.237
Does the zombie
want to know, too?

33:49.271 --> 33:52.173
Oh. I forgot to tell you ...
he sculpts in the nude.

33:52.208 --> 33:54.142
I want to hear everything.

33:54.176 --> 33:57.412
A-after we catch the
tomahawk killer. Focus.

33:57.446 --> 34:01.516
I can't concentrate. The thought
of my impending incarceration ...

34:01.551 --> 34:02.650
Stop!

34:03.619 --> 34:05.253
Okay, you're right.
You're right.

34:05.288 --> 34:06.722
Martha Stewart
flourished in jail.

34:06.756 --> 34:09.158
But she was
in a minimum-security prison.

34:09.193 --> 34:10.293
Where do taggers go?

34:10.327 --> 34:14.731
Oh! Can you please just tell
me if the wounds on Steve Bogart

34:14.766 --> 34:18.969
are from the same weapon
that killed Justin and Bernard?

34:23.308 --> 34:25.141
Let me guess ...
he smells?

34:25.176 --> 34:26.443
Yes!

34:26.476 --> 34:28.745
I really am preoccupied.
Don't you smell it?

34:28.780 --> 34:30.446
It's acetic acid.

34:32.382 --> 34:33.382
Cool?

34:33.417 --> 34:34.784
Well, it is,
because it tells me

34:34.818 --> 34:36.552
he was killed
more than 72 hours ago.

34:36.587 --> 34:38.353
What ... three days ago?

34:38.388 --> 34:43.025
Wait, so, Steve here was killed
before Justin and Bernard?

34:44.827 --> 34:46.428
Oop!
I forgot something.

34:46.462 --> 34:48.830
The summons that Frankie
wrote you was a fake.

34:48.864 --> 34:51.400
You can wear your McQueen on
your next date with the zombie.

34:51.434 --> 34:53.168
Oh, my god.
I'm so relieved.

34:53.202 --> 34:55.737
I can feel my cortisol level dropping.

34:55.772 --> 34:58.606
Wait!
W-why did you let me suffer?

34:58.640 --> 35:02.576
- Trying to scare you straight.
- I will never tag again.

35:02.611 --> 35:07.281
- Just don't gossip with my mother.
- That, too.

35:10.119 --> 35:12.587
The killer
was looking for something.

35:12.621 --> 35:14.689
Maybe Bogart caught something on tape.

35:14.724 --> 35:17.392
Yeah, but what? He didn't
catch either murder on tape.

35:17.426 --> 35:20.228
Yeah. Yeah, he was already
cooking in his jacuzzi

35:20.262 --> 35:22.230
when Bernard and Justin
were whacked.

35:22.265 --> 35:24.799
What are you doing with
this busted-up keyboard here?

35:25.802 --> 35:27.536
It was Justin's.
Let me see it.

35:27.570 --> 35:31.573
He said it contained
"classified intel."

35:34.377 --> 35:36.979
Bernard trusted him.
Maybe...

35:42.686 --> 35:45.421
Maybe the killer was looking for this.

35:45.456 --> 35:47.623
See what's on it.

36:07.918 --> 36:09.718
Thanks.

36:18.428 --> 36:20.329
Canvases are selling for $25k each.

36:20.364 --> 36:21.664
They'll be worth triple that

36:21.699 --> 36:23.600
once my posters
have been mass-marketed.

36:23.634 --> 36:25.435
You'll have to wait in line.

36:25.469 --> 36:28.137
I think it's time
we told this fancy crowd

36:28.171 --> 36:31.006
who this talented artist is.

36:31.041 --> 36:32.474
They know. It's me.

36:32.508 --> 36:34.009
Go ahead, Frost!

36:36.145 --> 36:38.713
<i>Bogart:
Why do you paint that boy?</i>

36:40.983 --> 36:42.050
What is this?

36:42.084 --> 36:44.452
Steve Bogart's last documentary.

36:44.486 --> 36:46.354
<i>Bernard:
To give him peace.</i>

36:46.388 --> 36:50.526
<i>You know how they make an
8-year-old boy a suicide bomber?</i>

36:50.560 --> 36:55.131
<i>They tell him that the
infidels will die but he won't.</i>

36:57.535 --> 37:00.237
<i>He was staring right at me
when his face blew apart.</i>

37:02.007 --> 37:03.274
<i>So calm.</i>

37:05.511 --> 37:07.512
That's why
he was so haunted.

37:07.546 --> 37:10.014
He couldn't kill that little boy.

37:10.049 --> 37:12.650
<i>You've depicted that pain
in your art.</i>

37:12.685 --> 37:14.919
<i>It's not art!</i>

37:14.954 --> 37:18.256
<i>And you can tell that guy
that he can't have it!</i>

37:18.290 --> 37:20.625
<i>You can't have it!
It's not for sale!</i>

37:24.062 --> 37:26.697
<i>I let my friends die.</i>

37:27.799 --> 37:32.036
<i>Stop recording.
Stop recording!</i>

37:32.071 --> 37:33.905
<i>Look,
give me the video card!</i>

37:33.940 --> 37:36.242
<i>Give me ...
give me the video card!</i>

37:36.977 --> 37:39.144
<i>Justin, take it ...</i>

37:42.515 --> 37:43.983
You couldn't break through as an artist.

37:44.017 --> 37:47.120
You didn't have the talent.
But Bernard did.

37:47.154 --> 37:48.721
He just showed up,

37:48.756 --> 37:50.456
started painting million-dollar
art in your alley.

37:50.491 --> 37:51.524
You're crazy.

37:51.559 --> 37:53.659
Triple homicide ...
that's crazy.

37:53.694 --> 37:56.596
You killed steve Bogart because
he had footage of Bernard painting.

37:56.630 --> 37:57.997
Bernard didn't want your money.

37:58.031 --> 37:59.465
You had to kill him
to get these canvases.

37:59.499 --> 38:00.867
They were
in his shopping cart, right?

38:00.901 --> 38:02.702
And you killed Justin
because he was a witness.

38:02.736 --> 38:04.003
You can't prove anything!

38:04.037 --> 38:06.105
Oh, I think we can.

38:06.139 --> 38:09.041
Note to self ... always get rid
of the murder weapon.

38:09.076 --> 38:11.710
You're gonna be famous
after all. Cuff him.

38:11.745 --> 38:13.846
Come on.

38:19.019 --> 38:20.586
Thank you.

38:35.403 --> 38:37.804
I've been having this conversation
in my head for a long time.

38:37.839 --> 38:39.573
Jane, it's not a good time to talk.

38:39.607 --> 38:41.641
No, I-I understand that
it's not a good time to talk

38:41.676 --> 38:44.010
when you're 6,000 miles away
and people are shooting at you.

38:44.545 --> 38:47.080
But you came home,
and you didn't tell me.

38:47.115 --> 38:48.882
And I don't understand why.

38:48.916 --> 38:50.684
I don't want to have
this conversation.

38:50.718 --> 38:54.020
Casey, you and I have been
friends since high school.

38:55.522 --> 38:58.757
And then,
w-when we saw each other again,

38:58.792 --> 39:00.926
I wasn't some goofy freshman

39:00.960 --> 39:03.829
and ... and you weren't
Mr. Big man on campus anymore.

39:03.863 --> 39:06.632
We ... we were just people.

39:06.666 --> 39:10.537
Two people that had ...
had been through some bad things.

39:13.808 --> 39:15.910
I-I fell in love with you.

39:17.913 --> 39:19.514
Jane, please.

39:19.549 --> 39:23.085
And I know you did.
I know it.

39:23.119 --> 39:28.389
Because they sent you to some
godforsaken, war-torn desert,

39:28.423 --> 39:31.726
and you kept calling me
to hear my voice.

39:31.760 --> 39:33.194
And then I stopped, didn't I?

39:34.964 --> 39:38.332
I have your phone number.
If I'd wanted to see you, I ...

39:41.903 --> 39:44.805
If I had anything to offer you,
I would have reached out.

39:44.839 --> 39:47.575
But I didn't, and I don't.

39:47.609 --> 39:52.838
The only people in my life I have
room for are these wounded vets.

39:53.783 --> 39:59.622
- I'm sorry, Jane.
- I'm sorry, too.

40:21.044 --> 40:22.711
You're a fool.

40:57.549 --> 40:59.049
Well, that was a great idea.

40:59.083 --> 41:01.084
He said I was
the girl of his dreams.

41:01.119 --> 41:05.022
Maybe it's just too hard for him
to be in a relationship right now.

41:05.056 --> 41:06.957
Yeah ... with me, ever.

41:08.126 --> 41:10.495
Jane, I'm so sorry.

41:11.864 --> 41:15.667
- Let's go do something crazy.
- You feel like tagging?

41:15.701 --> 41:20.739
No.
God, no. Not that crazy.

41:20.774 --> 41:22.675
Oh. Oh. Oh.

41:22.709 --> 41:24.010
So, you mean like

41:24.044 --> 41:27.013
"graham crackers
and canned frosting" crazy?

41:27.047 --> 41:28.614
And a box of Shiraz.

41:30.450 --> 41:32.818
It's a little too peppery
and full-bodied ...

41:32.853 --> 41:34.853
- Work with me.
- Okay.

41:34.888 --> 41:36.822
Okay.
