00:03.963 --> 00:07.592
When I began studying
humpback whales almost 50 years ago,

00:07.759 --> 00:10.737
there was very little funding
for such research.

00:10.837 --> 00:15.400
I'd like to thank the Pacific Life Foundation
for their unparalleled generosity

00:15.500 --> 00:18.933
in supporting the conservation
of humpback whales

00:19.033 --> 00:21.708
and other marine mammals.

00:24.317 --> 00:28.388
Enabling a better future
is what Pacific Life does,

00:28.488 --> 00:32.892
and their support of a healthy
ocean benefits all of us,

00:32.992 --> 00:34.994
whales as well as people.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.074

01:05.692 --> 01:08.945
Our planet holds a kind of parallel universe.

01:15.702 --> 01:19.038
A place of wonder where giants roam free.

01:46.149 --> 01:50.528
For thousands of years, we could
only wonder about humpback whales.

01:53.906 --> 01:56.559
Now, by exploring their world,

01:56.659 --> 01:59.662
we're getting surprising
glimpses into their lives.

02:05.668 --> 02:09.422
A 40-ton adult appears
weightless in its ocean home.

02:28.941 --> 02:33.946
Though longer than a school bus,
these 50-foot giants are nimble.

02:39.369 --> 02:42.772
With a wingspan greater than most Learjets,

02:42.872 --> 02:46.358
humpbacks are magnificent acrobats.

02:53.132 --> 02:55.785
Often seen in shallow waters,

02:55.885 --> 02:59.722
these mammals occasionally dive
to a depth of 1,000 feet.

03:09.107 --> 03:13.845
Each bump on their heads
contains a single stiff hair,

03:13.945 --> 03:16.948
which may help them sense their environment.

03:23.496 --> 03:27.066
Today, we celebrate them...

03:27.166 --> 03:29.168
but it wasn't always so.

03:34.173 --> 03:39.804
Whales were hunted for hundreds of years
and rendered into oil to light our cities.

03:42.014 --> 03:45.043
When whalers developed exploding harpoons,

03:45.143 --> 03:47.520
these giants had no chance.

03:52.775 --> 03:56.696
We nearly wiped humpback whales
off the face of the planet.

04:01.868 --> 04:05.938
Then, during the Cold War,
a U.S. Navy observer,

04:06.038 --> 04:08.900
recording the hum of Soviet submarines,

04:09.000 --> 04:11.002
heard something mysterious.

04:13.713 --> 04:17.550
The otherworldly calls of humpback whales.

04:21.721 --> 04:24.290
Humpbacks string their songs together

04:24.390 --> 04:28.252
in a continuous river of sound.

04:28.352 --> 04:30.913
The music of the deep.

04:52.084 --> 04:55.279
In the 1970s, when these
recordings were studied

04:55.379 --> 04:58.908
by scientists Roger Payne and Scott McVay,

04:59.008 --> 05:02.328
they recognized that
the seemingly random noises

05:02.428 --> 05:07.600
were actually precise rhythmic
patterns of sound, or "songs."

05:09.227 --> 05:11.337
When record albums were released,

05:11.437 --> 05:14.690
the humpbacks' songs
changed millions of hearts.

05:18.945 --> 05:21.639
People from many nations joined together

05:21.739 --> 05:24.742
to support a ban on killing whales.

05:32.124 --> 05:33.943
The song of the humpback

05:34.043 --> 05:37.655
helped us to begin to understand, finally,

05:37.755 --> 05:41.534
that whales are magnificent, complex beings

05:41.634 --> 05:45.955
worthy of protection, worthy of life.

05:46.055 --> 05:49.058
This was our turning point.

06:28.681 --> 06:32.084
The South Pacific.

06:32.184 --> 06:36.188
The humpback population here
was hard-hit by whaling.

06:44.155 --> 06:48.159
In Tonga, there were only
about 50 mature females left.

06:53.289 --> 06:58.361
In 1978, when the king of Tonga
banned the killing of whales,

06:58.461 --> 07:03.674
the humpbacks here slowly began
to recover, one calf at a time.

07:08.054 --> 07:12.458
Today in Tonga,
there are about 2,000 humpbacks,

07:12.558 --> 07:16.562
a fraction of what once was,
but it's a start.

07:24.236 --> 07:29.158
The humpback resurgence has now
sparked a whale-watching boom here.

07:37.833 --> 07:41.520
The increased tourism has raised
the standard of living

07:41.620 --> 07:45.257
for the local people, like Ali Takau.

07:46.092 --> 07:48.619
My grandfather was a whaler.

07:48.719 --> 07:52.582
He hunted humpbacks to feed our family.

07:52.682 --> 07:57.795
Instead of killing humpbacks,
Ali works hard to save them.

08:01.482 --> 08:06.237
The future of our humpbacks
depends on these children.

08:07.530 --> 08:10.141
I tell the kids about the whaling days,

08:10.241 --> 08:14.161
so we never have that kind of killing again.

08:16.247 --> 08:19.317
My job is taking tourists and scientists

08:19.417 --> 08:21.419
out to see the humpbacks.

08:26.757 --> 08:31.329
Now these magnificent whales
have begun to recover.

08:31.429 --> 08:35.599
Each calf is critical
to Tonga's fragile resurgence.

08:38.602 --> 08:41.380
After a full year of pregnancy,

08:41.480 --> 08:45.276
mothers give birth to a single 14-foot baby.

08:54.827 --> 08:57.855
What's it like to be a newborn humpback,

08:57.955 --> 09:01.400
floating in a vast blue world,

09:01.500 --> 09:05.504
where your only landmark
is a mountain of mother?

09:28.027 --> 09:30.304
Humpbacks share these idyllic waters

09:30.404 --> 09:33.766
with a whole community of marine life.

09:33.866 --> 09:36.869
The remora fish come along for the ride.

09:51.675 --> 09:53.661
Even when the mother sleeps,

09:53.761 --> 09:57.322
the newborns don't stray far
from mother's milk.

10:01.685 --> 10:04.588
But after a few weeks, the calves get bolder,

10:04.688 --> 10:06.966
and they take off on their own.

10:07.066 --> 10:08.843
They're so curious.

10:08.943 --> 10:11.637
And they've got so much energy.

10:34.885 --> 10:37.847
These newborns learn
by copying their mothers.

10:38.556 --> 10:41.833
In their first year, they double in size.

11:25.978 --> 11:27.546
Once they get the hang of it,

11:27.646 --> 11:30.248
There's no stopping them.

11:42.661 --> 11:44.939
Each calf stays with its mother

11:45.039 --> 11:49.168
only about one year to learn about the world.

11:52.129 --> 11:55.216
How to migrate thousands of miles.

11:58.302 --> 12:00.971
What to eat and how to find it.

12:03.891 --> 12:06.894
Who to trust and who to fear.

12:09.897 --> 12:14.301
Whalers like my grandfather
once targeted mothers and calves,

12:14.401 --> 12:16.820
because they move so slowly.

12:18.364 --> 12:20.808
I always loved my grandfather,

12:20.908 --> 12:25.329
but he didn't understand
the need to stop killing whales.

12:29.667 --> 12:34.488
The killing stopped here in Tonga,
but not everywhere.

12:34.588 --> 12:38.742
Three nations... Japan, Norway and Iceland...

12:38.842 --> 12:42.096
Still allow commercial
and scientific whaling.

12:44.348 --> 12:47.001
Today, fewer people kill whales on purpose,

12:47.101 --> 12:50.337
but we now kill them without even knowing it.

12:50.437 --> 12:53.007
When a ship collides with a whale,

12:53.107 --> 12:55.509
the impact is often fatal.

12:55.609 --> 12:59.305
And the number of ships on
the world's oceans has doubled

12:59.405 --> 13:01.865
in the last 12 years.

13:04.368 --> 13:07.980
There is something we can do
about these fatal collisions.

13:08.080 --> 13:10.858
One solution is to slow down ships,

13:10.958 --> 13:16.297
or reroute them to avoid the
migratory pathways of whales.

13:25.556 --> 13:28.542
Here in Tonga, mothers go for months

13:28.642 --> 13:31.879
with almost nothing to eat.

13:31.979 --> 13:36.717
To find food, the humpback
whales in Tonga head south

13:36.817 --> 13:40.904
to the frigid, bountiful waters
of Antarctica.

13:44.125 --> 13:48.829
Many humpbacks in the North
Pacific Ocean migrate to Alaska.

14:35.709 --> 14:38.904
Dr. Fred Sharpe has been
studying the behaviors

14:39.004 --> 14:43.050
of humpback whales here
for the past 25 summers.

14:49.807 --> 14:54.628
Most of the time, humpback
whales in Alaska feed on krill.

14:54.728 --> 14:59.049
These small, shrimp-like
crustaceans thrive here,

14:59.149 --> 15:04.430
in waters enriched by upwelling
currents and glacial nutrients.

15:04.530 --> 15:07.474
The tiny krill might be harder to catch

15:07.574 --> 15:10.811
if humpback whales had teeth, but they don't.

15:10.911 --> 15:12.771
About three hours away,
about three hours away.

15:12.871 --> 15:15.941
Instead of teeth,
humpback whales have baleen.

15:16.041 --> 15:19.737
It's a kind of strainer that hangs
from the roof of their mouth.

15:19.837 --> 15:22.573
It lets the water through, but allows them

15:22.673 --> 15:25.909
to trap these tasty morsels,
like the fish and the krill.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.750
When we're trying to locate big feeding pods,

15:32.850 --> 15:36.420
it's almost like
you're coming home to family.

15:36.520 --> 15:39.840
Fred has studied
these particular whales for so long...

15:39.940 --> 15:41.175
Bubbles! Bubbles!

15:41.275 --> 15:44.928
That he can often tell
who's vocalizing just by listening.

15:51.910 --> 15:54.146
We know who is who,

15:54.246 --> 15:57.358
because each of these whales has
a really distinctive tail fluke.

15:57.458 --> 15:59.526
They're kind of like a fingerprint.

15:59.626 --> 16:02.187
No two are exactly alike.

16:02.546 --> 16:05.466
So... I run the prints.

16:10.862 --> 16:13.239
This is Melancholy.

16:14.141 --> 16:16.877
I've really come to know him
over the past 20 years,

16:16.977 --> 16:20.939
from studying his behaviors
and even sketching him.

16:24.234 --> 16:29.055
I often see Melancholy
with another male, who we call Vulture.

16:31.241 --> 16:33.977
Many whales feed individually,

16:34.077 --> 16:38.190
but Melancholy and his crew have
learned a really cool strategy.

16:38.290 --> 16:41.985
They can capture more fish
by working together as a team.

16:42.085 --> 16:46.657
When we hear the feeding calls
and see the whales group together,

16:46.757 --> 16:49.635
we know we're in for quite a show.

16:51.512 --> 16:54.832
What happens next is
one of the most incredible

16:54.932 --> 16:58.185
and complex animal behaviors ever observed.

17:00.020 --> 17:03.273
It's called "group bubble-net feeding."

17:06.108 --> 17:08.779
The first step is always
the synchronized dive.

17:14.701 --> 17:18.105
Some of the whales dive deep

17:18.204 --> 17:20.773
underneath the school of herring

17:20.874 --> 17:23.694
to drive them up towards the surface.

17:23.794 --> 17:26.029
With their long pectoral flippers,

17:26.128 --> 17:29.007
they can outmaneuver fast-moving prey.

17:33.845 --> 17:37.082
The bubble specialist
blows a stream of bubbles,

17:37.182 --> 17:39.751
forming a spiraling wall of air

17:39.851 --> 17:43.730
that acts like a net to keep
the fish from getting away.

17:45.732 --> 17:50.036
The designated vocalizer begins
to make almost deafening sounds...

17:51.405 --> 17:54.440
Scaring the fish up towards the surface.

18:56.219 --> 18:59.206
The humpback mouth expands so wide,

18:59.306 --> 19:01.500
they could swallow a small car.

19:13.654 --> 19:16.974
They can eat up to a ton of food
in a single day.

19:17.074 --> 19:19.451
That's like 8,000 hamburgers.

19:33.799 --> 19:36.577
Well, as it starts to get cold
up here in the fall,

19:36.677 --> 19:41.707
Melancholy, Vulture and all
the other whales begin to leave.

19:41.807 --> 19:46.753
They'll travel thousands of miles down
to their warm-water breeding areas

19:46.853 --> 19:50.273
like Costa Rica, Mexico and Hawaii.

19:56.530 --> 20:02.936
Some humpbacks migrate
5,000 miles one way every year...

20:03.036 --> 20:07.040
One of the longest known
migrations of any mammal.

20:10.210 --> 20:14.197
There are 15 distinct populations
of humpback whales,

20:14.297 --> 20:17.300
located in all the oceans of the world.

20:23.890 --> 20:27.085
They feed in polar and subpolar regions,

20:27.185 --> 20:29.980
and breed and give birth in the Tropics.

20:39.823 --> 20:42.434
Each winter, the Hawaiian Islands host

20:42.534 --> 20:46.480
the largest gathering of
humpbacks in the North Pacific.

20:46.580 --> 20:49.040
Thousands of whales.

20:52.836 --> 20:56.339
Humpbacks may live up to 80 years or more.

20:58.008 --> 21:02.429
They seem as curious about us
as we are about them.

21:06.725 --> 21:09.252
Other whales and dolphins vocalize,

21:09.352 --> 21:12.756
but humpbacks make
a greater variety of sounds

21:12.856 --> 21:14.758
than any other whale...

21:14.858 --> 21:17.594
including grunts...

21:17.694 --> 21:19.680
groans...

21:19.780 --> 21:21.682
thwops...

21:21.782 --> 21:23.684
snorts...

21:23.784 --> 21:25.786
and barks.

21:34.377 --> 21:37.364
When humpbacks leap, or breach,

21:37.464 --> 21:40.534
they make it look easy.

21:40.634 --> 21:44.996
No other whale leaps so high so often.

21:45.096 --> 21:48.500
We're not exactly sure why they do it,

21:48.600 --> 21:51.102
but we're glad they do.

23:38.376 --> 23:42.781
On a quiet morning in Hawaii,
you can hear hundreds of humpbacks

23:42.881 --> 23:47.118
in their hidden world below,
all singing at once.

23:48.595 --> 23:53.792
A reminder of how their songs began
changing our hearts so many years ago.

24:03.109 --> 24:07.305
Today, Dr. Jim Darling lowers
the hydrophone into the water,

24:07.405 --> 24:11.935
just as he did decades ago
when Roger Payne first invited him here

24:12.035 --> 24:14.438
to record humpback whales.

24:17.707 --> 24:22.028
For scientists like Jim,
finding singers isn't easy,

24:22.128 --> 24:25.048
but there are clues.

24:28.593 --> 24:34.332
When whales dive, they leave
a slick spot on the surface...

24:34.432 --> 24:38.168
what researchers call a footprint.

24:39.270 --> 24:44.384
Sometimes when Jim looks down
through the footprint, he spots a singer.

24:51.015 --> 24:55.979
All the singers in Hawaii start each
breeding season singing the same song.

24:57.956 --> 25:01.484
Incredibly, when one singer changes his song,

25:01.584 --> 25:04.620
they all adopt those same changes.

25:06.464 --> 25:10.744
By comparing the latest song
against previous versions,

25:10.844 --> 25:14.581
Jim can pinpoint exactly what has changed.

25:14.681 --> 25:17.208
Jim's colleague, Dr. Meagan Jones,

25:17.708 --> 25:21.004
helps him search
for those changes in the song.

25:21.104 --> 25:25.592
Two years ago, Jim recorded a song
with a really distinctive phrase.

25:25.692 --> 25:27.093
That's really different.

25:31.281 --> 25:34.434
We started calling it "chuckles"
because it made us laugh.

25:37.037 --> 25:40.023
But this year, the chuckles
are starting to disappear.

25:50.050 --> 25:53.578
After years of study,
scientists were surprised to discover

25:53.678 --> 25:57.123
the singers were all males.

26:09.652 --> 26:14.741
While the males are busy singing,
what are the females up to?

26:18.203 --> 26:23.166
Dr. Meagan Jones studies
the behavior of female humpbacks.

26:23.625 --> 26:28.488
It's not easy, because they spend
90% of their time underwater,

26:28.588 --> 26:31.074
out of sight.

26:31.174 --> 26:34.093
So she catches only glimpses.

26:40.725 --> 26:43.728
One of the most important questions
I'm trying to answer

26:43.828 --> 26:46.632
is how females choose their mates.

26:55.949 --> 26:59.452
No one has ever observed mating
between humpbacks.

27:01.287 --> 27:04.524
But we often see a male and
female pair resting together.

27:04.624 --> 27:06.609
Just before and just after,

27:06.709 --> 27:09.712
we see males fighting over the females.

27:12.882 --> 27:16.703
The battle-scarred male escort
is actually on guard,

27:16.803 --> 27:20.206
watching and listening for his rivals.

27:20.306 --> 27:23.835
When intruders show up,
he tries to fight them off.

27:49.627 --> 27:53.031
20 males pursuing just one female.

27:53.131 --> 27:57.677
We think the males are vying
for the prime spot, closest to the female.

27:59.888 --> 28:04.851
The escort will use all kinds
of tactics to defend his position.

28:12.025 --> 28:15.553
He streams bubbles.

28:15.653 --> 28:17.263
He lunges...

28:17.363 --> 28:18.681
charges...

28:18.781 --> 28:21.784
and even collides with other males.

28:28.625 --> 28:32.070
Is the female leading these males?

28:32.170 --> 28:34.489
Or is she being chased?

28:34.589 --> 28:36.491
We're not sure...

28:36.591 --> 28:39.327
but we think she wants to mate
as soon as possible

28:39.427 --> 28:43.248
so she can return to Alaska
and resume eating.

28:43.348 --> 28:47.669
For whales, bigger mothers
often make better mothers.

28:47.769 --> 28:50.672
She needs to be
in the best physical condition

28:50.772 --> 28:53.691
when she gives birth the following year.

29:21.970 --> 29:25.181
This chase lasted four grueling hours.

29:26.724 --> 29:29.460
We think the competition may allow the female

29:29.560 --> 29:32.563
the opportunity to select the fittest mate.

29:34.774 --> 29:38.011
One day, just as the other
male rivals swam away,

29:38.111 --> 29:40.513
the male and female pair stayed around

29:40.613 --> 29:44.450
and circled our boat for well over an hour.

30:01.592 --> 30:05.330
At first, we thought the female
was swimming upside down

30:05.430 --> 30:08.599
and using the boat to discourage the male.

30:11.269 --> 30:16.049
But as we watched the pair circle
and dance around each other and us,

30:16.149 --> 30:20.303
it became clear that at least in this case,
the female was following him

30:20.403 --> 30:23.406
as much as the male was following her.

30:26.826 --> 30:29.520
Was this courtship?

30:29.620 --> 30:32.623
Was she trying to attract him?

30:34.751 --> 30:38.529
This is what we think may be happening,
but until we see mating,

30:38.629 --> 30:41.007
we can just never be sure.

30:43.760 --> 30:46.346
For me, these are the best kind of days,

30:46.888 --> 30:50.933
when new observations lead to new questions.

30:57.065 --> 30:59.050
When Meagan is out studying whales,

30:59.150 --> 31:04.389
she sometimes runs into the real dangers
they face, like loose, floating debris.

31:04.489 --> 31:06.307
...major threat to the animals.

31:06.407 --> 31:09.811
More than half of these
humpback whales bear scars

31:09.911 --> 31:13.081
from being tangled up in ropes
and fishing nets.

31:15.166 --> 31:18.236
This humpback whale population is growing,

31:18.336 --> 31:20.571
but we think worldwide

31:20.671 --> 31:24.867
the humpback population
may be only 40% of what it was

31:24.967 --> 31:27.345
before whaling began.

31:29.263 --> 31:32.500
Some of the most serious
problems facing whales

31:32.600 --> 31:35.545
have no immediate solution.

31:35.645 --> 31:38.256
But when individual whales get entangled,

31:38.356 --> 31:42.218
some of them can be saved by rescue teams,

31:42.318 --> 31:44.779
like the one here in Hawaii.

31:47.698 --> 31:49.350
Joe, let's see if we can
get underway in five.

31:49.450 --> 31:51.227
GPS coordinates set.

31:54.997 --> 31:58.918
Most rescues start
with a phone call from a boater.

31:59.752 --> 32:04.715
Reporting entangled whales is one
important way to help humpbacks.

32:05.758 --> 32:08.369
Looking for your position.

32:08.469 --> 32:12.473
The team caught up to the entangled
whale in just under an hour.

32:22.400 --> 32:24.260
This young, energetic humpback whale

32:24.360 --> 32:28.781
was trailing more than 200 feet
of line and buoys behind it.

32:29.907 --> 32:34.145
Each entanglement is different,
so team leader Ed Lyman

32:34.245 --> 32:36.814
has to keep adjusting his strategy.

32:36.914 --> 32:39.317
Keep an eye out. We don't want to lose it.

32:39.417 --> 32:41.903
If this young whale
is not set free by Ed's team,

32:42.003 --> 32:45.073
he could die from infection, starvation

32:45.173 --> 32:47.175
or even drowning.

32:48.926 --> 32:50.636
A key tool is their grapple.

32:51.637 --> 32:53.998
That's how they hook onto the trailing gear

32:54.098 --> 32:57.935
and then pull themselves close
enough to cut the whale free.

32:59.770 --> 33:03.174
We attach a transmitter to help
track the whale, in case we lose it,

33:03.274 --> 33:07.195
and buoys to keep it from diving deep.

33:08.154 --> 33:10.098
Even with extensive training,

33:10.198 --> 33:12.767
it's dangerous for Ed and Joe to get so close

33:12.867 --> 33:15.620
to a huge animal under stress.

33:16.829 --> 33:18.439
We work entirely from boats.

33:18.539 --> 33:22.710
People have been killed jumping
in the water to cut whales free.

33:23.711 --> 33:24.895
Let's be careful here!

33:24.995 --> 33:29.367
If we hear signs of stress,
like a trumpeting blow, we back off.

33:36.933 --> 33:38.709
Our pole cam gives us an underwater view

33:38.809 --> 33:41.187
and helps us see what's going on.

33:41.604 --> 33:44.173
We need to get this gear off.

33:44.273 --> 33:46.692
These wounds are... are bad.

33:47.485 --> 33:50.388
These young ones, they're unpredictable.

33:50.488 --> 33:54.517
Our whale makes a sudden U-turn
and snags his gear on a nearby boat,

33:54.617 --> 33:56.185
so we race back to cut the boat free.

33:56.285 --> 33:58.187
You got it? Okay, good. Next side.

33:58.287 --> 34:01.832
As soon as we cut that line,
he takes right off.

34:04.752 --> 34:09.005
Even dragging all those buoys,
the whale is just pulling us too fast.

34:11.676 --> 34:16.038
We actually got what the old-time
whalers call a Nantucket sleigh ride.

34:16.138 --> 34:18.416
Let me help you.

34:21.601 --> 34:24.522
- Still running hard.
- Yeah.

34:27.358 --> 34:30.360
We attach a sea anchor to slow it down.

34:41.621 --> 34:43.107
Okay, knife is out.

34:43.206 --> 34:44.734
You're doing good.

34:44.833 --> 34:46.277
Okay, here, I'm right beside you.

34:46.377 --> 34:50.864
Finally, the whale slows down
enough to give Ed a clean angle.

34:50.965 --> 34:52.574
So he moves in for the cut.

34:52.675 --> 34:54.118
Perfect. Right there.

34:54.217 --> 34:57.263
And... here comes.

34:58.097 --> 34:59.081
Okay!

35:04.562 --> 35:07.048
- Okay.
- Oh, nice slice!

35:20.578 --> 35:24.373
It all went their way today,
but it doesn't always work out.

35:29.712 --> 35:32.923
Even Ed's heroic team can't save every whale.

35:33.924 --> 35:37.511
But you and I can help reduce
the number of entangled humpbacks.

35:39.388 --> 35:42.291
Encourage the use of whale-safe gear,

35:42.391 --> 35:46.020
and keep debris out of the ocean.

35:51.567 --> 35:55.321
I'm in awe of humpback whales.

35:56.280 --> 36:00.660
For centuries, men in boats
brought them pain and death.

36:01.786 --> 36:07.750
It brings us such joy to flip that around
and bring them life instead.

36:13.172 --> 36:18.077
It took hundreds of years for people
all across the world to wake up

36:18.177 --> 36:20.930
and hear the song of the humpbacks.

36:23.933 --> 36:29.021
In the early days,
humpbacks were known as our guardians.

36:29.772 --> 36:32.274
Now it's our turn.

36:47.289 --> 36:51.961
Future generations of scientists
have their work cut out for them.

36:55.047 --> 36:59.243
Each new insight scientists gain
into these remarkable whales

36:59.343 --> 37:03.639
helps us protect them against
the growing threats they face.

37:13.357 --> 37:17.053
Oceans cover 71% of our planet,

37:17.153 --> 37:20.072
and humpbacks roam them all.

37:24.285 --> 37:27.563
Just one look in their eye will tell you

37:27.663 --> 37:31.292
we have much more to learn about their world.

37:32.960 --> 37:37.131
And to think, we nearly missed that chance.
