Yeah, I may have a little crush.

Our patient Ruth Synford, she...

[clears throat]
She died.

02:16.571 --> 02:17.746
What?

02:17.789 --> 02:20.096
She went into
V-fib again

02:20.140 --> 02:21.445
and she died of

02:21.489 --> 02:22.794
Why wasn't I called?

02:22.838 --> 02:23.969
It just all
happened so fast.

02:24.013 --> 02:25.710
No, I'm her surgeon.

02:25.754 --> 02:27.582
We tried to save her,

I'm sorry.

ADRIENNE:
Even now, I'm stunned
by Ruth's death.

02:39.246 --> 02:42.684
She just had so much
more life to live.

02:44.033 --> 02:45.339
[laughs]: She-she told me
she wanted to get back out

02:45.382 --> 02:47.123

and shoot her age.

02:47.167 --> 02:50.561
I said,
"Did you ever shoot a 71?"

She said, "Not yet,
but with this new lease on life

02:53.477 --> 02:55.827
you're giving me, I intend to."

02:57.786 --> 03:01.224
So while I, uh, don't agree
with her... [clears throat]

03:01.268 --> 03:04.923
daughter's claim that
I caused her mother's death,

03:04.967 --> 03:08.405
I am sympathetic to her grief.

I lost my own mother a little
more than a year ago and...

03:11.626 --> 03:12.931

Stop, stop.

03:12.975 --> 03:14.759
Stop talking.

03:14.803 --> 03:16.892
I really wish you would let her
finish just once, Vincent.

03:16.935 --> 03:18.763
If she finishes, we're finished.

03:18.807 --> 03:21.549
She is signaling to the jury
that they should be sympathetic

03:21.592 --> 03:23.203
to the dead woman's daughter.

03:23.246 --> 03:26.423
Yes. It's what we call humanity.

03:26.467 --> 03:28.512
Call it whatever you want,
but in my experience

03:28.556 --> 03:31.080
as a seasoned medical
malpractice litigator,

03:31.123 --> 03:33.213
that's the last thing
we want to do.

03:33.256 --> 03:35.084
What? Be human?

03:35.127 --> 03:37.217
We need to stick to the facts.

03:37.260 --> 03:38.870
And those are,
in your humble opinion?

03:38.914 --> 03:40.524
They say the surgery
was too risky,

03:40.568 --> 03:43.266
we say Ruth Synford
consented to the risk. Fact.

03:43.310 --> 03:47.618
Okay, Adrienne will be in a
stronger position with the jury

03:47.662 --> 03:49.751
if she doesn't come across
as a cold clinician,

03:49.794 --> 03:51.709
if she shows compassion.

03:51.753 --> 03:53.058
I completely disagree.

03:53.102 --> 03:54.538
If we go down this path
of sympathy,

03:54.582 --> 03:56.714
we might as well have
settled yesterday.

03:56.758 --> 03:58.455

03:58.499 --> 04:00.718

Well, Bryan Vincent,
he may not be Mr. Cuddly,

04:10.772 --> 04:13.818
but he's a legend in
the medical malpractice world.

04:13.862 --> 04:16.473
His firm represents nearly
every hospital in New York.

04:16.517 --> 04:18.867

with his suit.

04:18.910 --> 04:22.262
Yeah, and he has two first
names. Bryan Vincent?

04:22.305 --> 04:23.741
I don't trust anyone
who has two first names.

listen to them fighting?

Do you want to know
another fact?

04:31.793 --> 04:33.229
I can't wait.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.100
Lucy Synford wasn't even
by her mother's side

04:35.144 --> 04:36.667
when she had the surgery.

04:36.711 --> 04:38.930
Now she's trying to exploit
her mother's death

04:38.974 --> 04:41.106
for her own financial gain.It we freight this jury

04:41.150 --> 04:43.935
with the daughter's
traumatic emotional journey,

04:43.979 --> 04:47.852
that is gonna be catastrophic
for Adrienne's case.

04:47.896 --> 04:51.595
Geez, you used so many
big words in that sentence,

04:51.639 --> 04:54.685
all I heard was you trying to
tell me that you have a PhD.

04:54.729 --> 04:57.775
I'll make it simpler: attack
the plaintiff, lose the case.

04:57.819 --> 04:59.777
Thank you for your opinion,
but let me remind you

04:59.821 --> 05:01.910
of one last,
very important fact.

05:01.953 --> 05:02.867
What is that?

05:02.911 --> 05:04.216
You are the consultant,

05:04.260 --> 05:06.349
I am the lawyer.

05:06.393 --> 05:08.046
Lawyer trumps consultant.

Once the contracts are signed,

05:26.456 --> 05:28.197
we'll bill you for payment.

05:28.240 --> 05:29.851
No, I'm taking this pro bono.

05:29.894 --> 05:31.679
Absolutely not.

You saved my life with
your bypass surgery, Adrienne.

05:35.160 --> 05:37.337
I was paid for my work,
you'll be paid for yours.

05:37.380 --> 05:39.382

covering Mr. Vincent's fee.

out of pocket for TAC.

No?

05:48.739 --> 05:50.306
That a word, isn't it?

05:53.918 --> 05:58.401
I knew that you and Adrienne had
a prior relationship, but, uh,

05:58.445 --> 06:01.056
did I just hear you say
that you owe her your life?

06:01.099 --> 06:04.494
And I do.
I never said otherwise.

06:04.538 --> 06:09.064
You do realize how emotionally
compromised you are?

06:09.107 --> 06:11.675
[laughs softly]
Not compromised.

06:11.719 --> 06:14.156
Connected. I flatlined

06:14.199 --> 06:16.854
on that table,
and her surgery saved my life.

06:16.898 --> 06:19.727
She was there for me then,
I'm here for her now.

06:19.770 --> 06:22.817
There's a reason
why doctors don't operate

06:22.860 --> 06:25.080

06:25.123 --> 06:28.823
It might be best for you to take
a couple steps back here.

I'm not taking a step back.

06:31.565 --> 06:33.393
Not an inch.I get it.

06:33.436 --> 06:35.525
You're used
to calling the shots.

But that's just not the way
that this is gonna go.

06:39.094 --> 06:41.270

the better
we're gonna get along.

Can you practice that speech
a little bit more,

maybe in front of a mirror,
because I-I don't think

06:47.755 --> 06:50.627
it quite has the punch
you're looking for.

[exhales] I thought Bull was
gonna lose it on that guy.

It's just a matter of time.

09:57.901 --> 09:59.381
BRYAN:
Yep.
We also want jurors

09:59.424 --> 10:01.949
who understand that just
because an individual

10:01.992 --> 10:03.994
is over 70 years old, doesn't
mean they don't understand

10:04.038 --> 10:05.648
risk and reward.Got it.

10:05.692 --> 10:08.999
Key to this trial, of course,
is going to be likability.

10:09.043 --> 10:10.653
We doing this again?

10:10.697 --> 10:12.568
I told you, the jury doesn't
need to like Adrienne,

10:12.612 --> 10:14.004
they just need to think
she's a good doctor.

10:14.048 --> 10:15.832
I'm not talking about her,
I'm talking about you.

10:15.876 --> 10:17.660
What? You don't like me?

10:17.704 --> 10:19.140
I'm crushed.

10:19.183 --> 10:20.271
If people don't like you,

10:20.315 --> 10:21.098
they're gonna project it
onto Adrienne.

10:21.142 --> 10:23.405
Don't worry, juries love me.

10:23.448 --> 10:25.146
You'll see.

10:30.499 --> 10:33.110
BRYAN:
Is there anyone here

10:33.154 --> 10:37.637
who rides horses,
bungee jumps or skydives?

10:37.680 --> 10:40.509
I, for one, get seasick
on an escalator.

10:40.552 --> 10:42.554
[soft laugher]But, uh, raise
your hand

10:42.598 --> 10:44.382
if you're brave at heart.

10:44.426 --> 10:45.993
You have your hand up.

10:46.036 --> 10:49.344
Good. Are you one
of the brave and mighty?

10:49.387 --> 10:51.172
I'm a BASE jumper.

10:51.215 --> 10:53.348
[scoffs]
I'm afraid to ask.

10:53.391 --> 10:54.523
It's when you jump off
a fixed object

10:54.566 --> 10:55.916
like a bridge or a building

10:55.959 --> 10:58.135
with nothing but a parachute.

10:58.179 --> 11:00.268
Yeah, I'd say that counts.

11:00.311 --> 11:03.097
I'm getting flop sweat
just picturing it.

11:03.140 --> 11:05.447
[laughter]This juror is acceptable,
Your Honor.

11:05.490 --> 11:08.537
Acceptable, but oh, how I worry.
I am calling your mother.

11:08.580 --> 11:09.843
[laughter]

11:09.886 --> 11:11.714
I can't believe this.MARISSA: I know,

11:11.758 --> 11:14.021
that juror seems
custom-made for us.

11:14.064 --> 11:15.892
No. Vincent.

11:15.936 --> 11:19.896
The jurors don't just
like him, they love him.

11:19.940 --> 11:22.290
Where was this guy
when we were prepping?

11:22.333 --> 11:23.857
BRYAN: Ma'am, forgive me
for asking a personal question,

11:23.900 --> 11:26.642
but, um, are you married?

11:26.686 --> 11:28.557
I was.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.951
I've been a widow for ten years.

11:30.994 --> 11:33.867
I'm sorry to hear that.
Do you have children?

11:33.910 --> 11:36.391
I do. Three boys.

11:36.434 --> 11:38.262
Ooh.

11:38.306 --> 11:42.092
Now, uh, when you have what
I like to call life decisions--

11:42.136 --> 11:45.661
selling the house,
updating your will,

11:45.705 --> 11:48.664
seeking medical treatment--
do you seek your boys' advice?

11:48.708 --> 11:50.318
I don't have to.

11:50.361 --> 11:55.105
They insert themselves
into anything I do nowadays.

11:55.149 --> 11:57.629
It's as if they think
I'm the child.

11:57.673 --> 11:58.935
Does that bother you,
that they don't seem

11:58.979 --> 12:00.284
to trust your judgment?

12:00.328 --> 12:02.504
It does, as a matter of fact.

12:03.810 --> 12:05.463
This juror is acceptable,
Your Honor.

12:05.507 --> 12:07.117
BULL:
Would it kill him

12:07.161 --> 12:08.640
to consult me?

12:08.684 --> 12:10.381
He is following
your strategy to a T.

12:10.425 --> 12:11.643
This woman is perfect.

12:11.687 --> 12:13.428
Her late husband
was even a doctor.

12:13.471 --> 12:15.212
Vincent doesn't know
the doctor part.

12:15.256 --> 12:16.953
What bothers you more,

12:16.997 --> 12:20.174
that he didn't consult you
or that the jury loves him?

12:20.217 --> 12:24.265
Told you I have charisma.

12:24.308 --> 12:25.832
Oh, it all bothers me.

12:26.833 --> 12:28.399
Is voir dire over?

12:28.443 --> 12:30.184
Just sat our last juror.

12:30.227 --> 12:31.881
Bull and Vincent?

12:31.925 --> 12:34.275
They're not making each other
friendship bracelets.

12:34.318 --> 12:36.190
But Bull didn't go off?Not yet.

12:36.233 --> 12:38.061
Ha.

12:38.105 --> 12:40.803
Well, guess that
means you're out.

12:40.847 --> 12:42.674
It's down to me and Chunk now.

12:42.718 --> 12:44.589
Well, as much as I would love
Bull to go off on that jerk,

12:44.633 --> 12:47.679
I am officially Team Chunk.

12:47.723 --> 12:50.334
[scoffs]
Someone's a sore loser.

12:50.378 --> 12:51.901
[clears throat]

12:51.945 --> 12:53.860
Uh, Taylor?

12:53.903 --> 12:57.602
I'm having second thoughts
about that thing with Henri.

12:57.646 --> 12:59.213
Really?My grandmother
always said,

12:59.256 --> 13:01.868
"If you go looking
for trouble, you'll find it."

13:01.911 --> 13:03.173
My grandmother always said,

13:03.217 --> 13:04.479
"Don't eat peanut butter
with wet hands,"

13:04.522 --> 13:06.394
but I don't think
that applies here.

13:06.437 --> 13:08.091
Let's pass.

13:08.135 --> 13:11.703
My gut's telling me
to let sleeping dogs lie.

13:11.747 --> 13:13.793
[footsteps receding]

13:16.883 --> 13:20.103
That's gonna be hard for you,
huh? Letting that dog sleep?

13:20.147 --> 13:21.626
Hey, I can let a dog sleep,

13:21.670 --> 13:25.021
it's just,
this dog is already awake.

13:25.065 --> 13:26.762
You already found something?

13:26.806 --> 13:28.372
It might be nothing.
It's probably nothing.

13:28.416 --> 13:30.113
I mean, it's something,

13:30.157 --> 13:32.550
but I think it's gonna turn out
to be a total nothing.

13:32.594 --> 13:34.857
Well, that's a lot
of word salad.[exhales]

13:34.901 --> 13:36.598
I just, I want to be sure.

13:36.641 --> 13:38.382
I would hate myself
if Marissa got hurt,

13:38.426 --> 13:40.254
especially because I'm the one

13:40.297 --> 13:42.734
who encouraged her to ask
Henri out in the first place.

13:42.778 --> 13:44.388
I would stay out of it.

13:44.432 --> 13:46.216
You know why they say
"Don't shoot the messenger"?

13:46.260 --> 13:48.653
Because people
always shoot the messenger?

13:50.264 --> 13:52.832
[sputters]

13:52.875 --> 13:54.834
JILL:
Ms. Banks, would you please

13:54.877 --> 13:58.228
tell the court about your
experience in the medical field?

13:58.272 --> 14:02.580
I've been a registered nurse
for over 20 years,

14:02.624 --> 14:04.887
and I have scrubbed in

14:04.931 --> 14:08.586
on over a thousand surgeries
in my career.

14:08.630 --> 14:10.980
JILL:Is it fair to say
you've assisted

14:11.024 --> 14:13.026
on a wide range of procedures?

14:13.069 --> 14:16.203
Yes, I've worked on everything
from routine procedures

14:16.246 --> 14:19.075
to surgeries
with a high degree of risk.

14:19.119 --> 14:22.078
And what about
Ruth Synford's mitral valve

14:22.122 --> 14:23.732
replacement surgery?

14:23.775 --> 14:26.909
Was that an inherently
risky procedure?

14:26.953 --> 14:28.215
BANKS:
With any surgery,

14:28.258 --> 14:29.912
there are risks,

14:29.956 --> 14:32.915
but this should have been
a fairly standard procedure.

14:32.959 --> 14:36.397
It's a surgery Dr. Corbett
has performed countless times.

14:36.440 --> 14:38.051
JILL:
"Should have been"?

14:38.094 --> 14:40.009
Was there
something about

14:40.053 --> 14:44.187
that particular surgery
that was not standard?

14:44.231 --> 14:46.711
Yes.

14:46.755 --> 14:51.238
When Dr. Corbett went
to insert the mitral valve,

14:51.281 --> 14:52.935
I saw her hand tremor.

14:52.979 --> 14:54.415
[whispered chatter]

14:54.458 --> 14:55.938
Where'd that come from?

14:55.982 --> 14:58.636
That is 100% not true.

14:58.680 --> 15:00.595
JILL:Can you please
explain to the court

15:00.638 --> 15:02.640
why, specifically,
it is problematic

15:02.684 --> 15:06.122
for a surgeon's hand
to tremor during surgery?

15:06.166 --> 15:08.777
An open-heart mitral valve
replacement surgery

15:08.820 --> 15:11.084
is all about precision.

15:11.127 --> 15:14.348
If the valve insertion is off
by just the tiniest fraction,

15:14.391 --> 15:17.220
it can set off a series
of electrical impulses

15:17.264 --> 15:20.006
in the heart
that can trigger V-fib.

15:20.049 --> 15:21.268
V-fib.

15:21.311 --> 15:23.052
Ventricular fibrillation.

15:23.096 --> 15:25.663
It's a dangerously abnormal
heart rhythm

15:25.707 --> 15:27.709
that can result in death.

15:27.752 --> 15:30.755
And was it V-fib
that killed Ruth Synford?

15:30.799 --> 15:33.367
Objection. The witness
is not a medical examiner.

15:33.410 --> 15:35.369
She's not qualified to render
an expert opinion

15:35.412 --> 15:37.458
as to what killed the patient.

15:37.501 --> 15:39.547
JILL:
Your Honor, the witness

15:39.590 --> 15:42.376
was the senior nurse present
at Ruth Synford's surgery.

15:42.419 --> 15:44.421
Her opinion is not only
highly relevant

15:44.465 --> 15:47.033
but based on years
of experience.

15:48.034 --> 15:50.166
I'll allow it.

15:50.210 --> 15:52.952
BANKS:The V-fib that Ruth
Synford experienced

15:52.995 --> 15:55.563
during surgery didn't
directly cause her death,

15:55.606 --> 15:58.827
but once a patient
has had one V-fib episode,

15:58.870 --> 16:02.222
the likelihood of another
increases exponentially,

16:02.265 --> 16:04.615
and the severity
of that second V-fib episode

16:04.659 --> 16:09.403
is usually stronger
and often fatal.

16:09.446 --> 16:11.187
As it was in this case.

16:11.231 --> 16:12.928
One last thing.

16:12.972 --> 16:17.889
You didn't mention the tremor
during your deposition.

16:17.933 --> 16:19.717
Why is that?

16:19.761 --> 16:24.592
There's a lot of pressure in
hospitals to support surgeons.

16:26.594 --> 16:28.900
I didn't want to jeopardize
my career.

16:28.944 --> 16:32.556
JILL:May I ask then, why
you're bringing it up now?

16:32.600 --> 16:36.386
My conscience got
the best of me.

16:36.430 --> 16:40.782
A person died and I felt
I couldn't stay silent.

16:40.825 --> 16:43.393
[exhales]
JILL:
Thank you.

16:43.437 --> 16:46.048
They can't believe her.

16:46.092 --> 16:48.181
Oh, but they do.

16:48.224 --> 16:50.444
Don't they, Jury Man?

16:57.581 --> 16:59.844
We just have to get
back to TAC and regroup.

16:59.888 --> 17:02.325
"Regroup" is the understatement
of the century.

17:02.369 --> 17:04.284
You killed her.Oh, no. Lucy.

17:04.327 --> 17:05.894
Whoa, whoa, whoa.Lucy, let's...

17:05.937 --> 17:07.113
No, no, no. My mother should've
lived another ten years, 20.

17:07.156 --> 17:09.115
No, I-I understand
how upset you are...

17:09.158 --> 17:11.291
You have a tremor.
You never should have been

17:11.334 --> 17:12.640
in that operating room.

17:12.683 --> 17:14.598
No, I didn't...You should be in jail.

17:14.642 --> 17:16.296
I don't think
we should do this here.JILL: Yes.

17:16.339 --> 17:17.949
We should go.

17:17.993 --> 17:20.604
BRYAN:
This is a disaster.

17:20.648 --> 17:22.084
That nurse's testimony means

17:22.128 --> 17:23.738
we're not just talking
negligence anymore.

17:23.781 --> 17:25.218
We're talking recklessness.

17:25.261 --> 17:28.569
No jury is gonna forgive you
operating with a tremor.

17:28.612 --> 17:30.614
I didn't have a tremor.

17:30.658 --> 17:32.007
We can have this discussion...With the potential
for punitive damages,

17:32.051 --> 17:33.313
Please...we could be talking millions.

17:33.356 --> 17:35.402
Okay, setbacks happen.

17:35.445 --> 17:39.101
So how about we just calm
down and talk strategy?

17:39.145 --> 17:41.234
No, thanks.

17:41.277 --> 17:43.149
"No, thanks"?I'll figure this out on my own.

17:45.020 --> 17:46.761
[scoffs]

17:46.804 --> 17:49.329
Okay, we're not
waiting on Vincent.

17:49.372 --> 17:50.852
We will come up
with our own strategy

17:50.895 --> 17:52.332
for dealing with this.

17:52.375 --> 17:54.334
Does Adrienne have a tremor?

17:54.377 --> 17:56.031
She swears she doesn't,
but I sent her to see a doctor.

17:57.815 --> 17:59.339
And we will know what we're
dealing with soon enough.

17:59.382 --> 18:01.123
Well, I talked to everyone
in that surgery, Bull.

18:01.167 --> 18:02.951
No one said anything
about a tremor.

18:02.994 --> 18:04.518
People seem to be changing
their stories.

18:04.561 --> 18:06.694
Let's hope it's not contagious.

18:06.737 --> 18:08.478
Hmm. I'll make the rounds again.

18:08.522 --> 18:10.263
I'd like to think that nurse
is lying, and if she is,

18:10.306 --> 18:13.266
I'd like to know why
so we can impeach her.

18:13.309 --> 18:14.354
Got it.

18:14.397 --> 18:15.442
TAYLOR:
I'll start looking

18:15.485 --> 18:17.226
into her on my end, too.

18:18.706 --> 18:21.448
I wouldn't be standing here
if it weren't for Adrienne.

18:21.491 --> 18:23.667
So let's do our best
to defend her.

18:32.285 --> 18:34.156
Hey. Do you have a minute?

18:34.200 --> 18:35.984
Uh, sure.

18:36.027 --> 18:38.987
Hey, make sure that you check
that nurse's employment history,

18:39.030 --> 18:40.641
performance reviews, the works.

18:40.684 --> 18:42.164
I'll get right on it. Um...

18:44.210 --> 18:46.473
There's something
I have to tell you first.

18:46.516 --> 18:48.301
Yeah?And let me just
preface this by saying,

18:48.344 --> 18:51.130
it sucks, it's not fair
and I wish it weren't true.

18:51.173 --> 18:52.348
W-What sucks?

18:54.307 --> 18:55.917
[exhales]

18:55.960 --> 19:00.269
I know you asked me
to stop looking into Henri,

19:00.313 --> 19:03.054
but I was already halfway
down a rabbit hole and...

19:06.275 --> 19:07.885
...Henri is married.

19:11.846 --> 19:12.847
[stammers]

19:12.890 --> 19:15.589
That doesn't make any sense.

19:15.632 --> 19:17.156
I'm so sorry.

19:17.199 --> 19:18.635
I know how much you like him,

19:18.679 --> 19:20.898
but thank God
we investigated him, right?

19:20.942 --> 19:23.510
We didn't investigate him,
Taylor. You did.

19:25.468 --> 19:27.122
I get that you're mad
at Henri...

19:27.166 --> 19:29.864
Of course I'm mad
at Henri, but...

19:29.907 --> 19:33.694
you went digging when
I explicitly asked you not to.

19:33.737 --> 19:35.391
Because I care about you.When you care
about a person,

19:35.435 --> 19:37.132
you don't go
behind their back.

19:37.176 --> 19:39.526
Marissa...We should talk about this later.

19:39.569 --> 19:42.529
You heard Bull. We have to do
whatever we can for Adrienne.

19:42.572 --> 19:44.270
Let's focus on that.

19:48.317 --> 19:50.972
[exhales]

19:51.015 --> 19:53.975
When we spoke before, you didn't
mention anything about a tremor.

19:54.018 --> 19:55.150
Because there wasn't one.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.760
Well, is it possible
you missed it?

19:56.804 --> 19:58.414
No.

19:58.458 --> 20:01.112
I had my eyes laser-focused
on Dr. Corbett's hands

20:01.156 --> 20:03.332
as she went to insert
the mitral valve.

20:03.376 --> 20:05.421
We all did. She never wavered.

20:05.465 --> 20:07.945
Why would Lisa Banks
lie about seeing it?

20:07.989 --> 20:09.599
I have to get to surgery.

20:09.643 --> 20:12.167
What if somebody lied
about you in court?

20:12.211 --> 20:14.213
And nobody put it right?

20:19.957 --> 20:22.003
I don't know if this has
anything to do with anything,

20:22.046 --> 20:24.919
but a few months
before Ruth Synford's surgery,

20:24.962 --> 20:27.400
Banks overmedicated
a patient in recovery

20:27.443 --> 20:29.663
and Adrienne dressed her down.

20:29.706 --> 20:31.142
Meaning?She tore her a new one

20:31.186 --> 20:32.535
in front of everyone.

20:32.579 --> 20:34.624
You think Corbett
was out of line?No.

20:34.668 --> 20:37.192
What we do, it's life or death.
Mistakes matter.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.020
Most people around here
have extra thick skin.

20:39.063 --> 20:40.978
They shrug it off, move on.

20:41.022 --> 20:42.502
But Banks didn't shrug it off.

20:42.545 --> 20:44.547
Yeah, I guess not.
Look, I really have to go.

20:44.591 --> 20:46.767
Appreciate your time, Doc.

20:46.810 --> 20:48.943
Was I strong with her? Yes.

20:48.986 --> 20:51.772
Because she'd
screwed up royally.

20:51.815 --> 20:53.991
But to lie on the stand
just to get back at me?

20:54.035 --> 20:56.080
Well, some people's resentment
runs deep.

20:56.124 --> 20:57.821
Now we know Banks
had a motive to lie,

20:57.865 --> 21:00.128
and that puts us in a position
to claw back the jury.

21:00.171 --> 21:02.783
It's a stretch to think
that a 20-year vet like Banks

21:02.826 --> 21:05.264
would perjure herself
to settle a grudge.

21:05.307 --> 21:08.702
And if I find it a stretch,
so will the jury.

21:08.745 --> 21:10.486
BULL:
Well, not when we tell them
that Adrienne's doctor gave her

21:10.530 --> 21:11.748
a clean bill of health.

21:11.792 --> 21:13.097
No, doctors have
each other's backs.

21:13.141 --> 21:14.664
That's what the jury will think.

21:14.708 --> 21:16.579
So, what's your fix?

21:16.623 --> 21:18.146
I've convinced
Sacred Heart Hospital

21:18.189 --> 21:19.974
to settle with the plaintiff.

21:20.017 --> 21:22.150
You what?And I recommend

21:22.193 --> 21:24.674
you join the settlement,
too, Adrienne.

21:25.675 --> 21:27.068
That's not a fix.

21:27.111 --> 21:28.374
That jury's never coming back.

21:28.417 --> 21:30.811
Not for a grudge,
not for a doctor's note.

21:30.854 --> 21:31.986
It's over.

21:32.029 --> 21:34.162
We haven't even put up our side.

21:34.205 --> 21:35.816
Well, we could try
to mount a comeback,

21:35.859 --> 21:38.340
but the upside isn't as up
as the downside's down.

21:38.384 --> 21:39.515
Oh, for the hospital, maybe.

21:39.559 --> 21:41.038
I mean, it's just money
for them.

21:41.082 --> 21:44.868
But for me, it's...
it is my career, my life.

21:44.912 --> 21:46.696
I know this is a difficult pill
to swallow.

21:46.740 --> 21:50.352
If I settle, people
will think I have a tremor.

21:50.396 --> 21:52.180
[sighs]I'll never practice again.

21:52.223 --> 21:54.574
It's the only path forward.

21:54.617 --> 21:58.229
Read the offer. Sleep on it.

22:01.407 --> 22:02.669
[door opens]

22:02.712 --> 22:04.540
Give me a moment.

22:05.454 --> 22:07.238
Hey.

22:07.282 --> 22:09.197
You're leaving her
out on an island.

22:09.240 --> 22:12.635
No, she's out on an island and
you are letting her stay there.

22:12.679 --> 22:14.158
When the jury hears
about this settlement,

22:14.202 --> 22:15.812
they're gonna assume
malpractice.

22:15.856 --> 22:17.379
They already do.

22:17.423 --> 22:18.859
You aren't doing Adrienne
any favors

22:18.902 --> 22:20.904
pretending she can
still win this case.

22:20.948 --> 22:22.210
And you're not doing
your job if you give up

22:22.253 --> 22:24.081
at the first sign of trouble.

22:24.125 --> 22:26.736
I'm not giving up, I am simply
giving my professional opinion,

22:26.780 --> 22:28.912
which is what I am hired to do.

22:31.306 --> 22:32.394
[exhales]

22:32.438 --> 22:33.569
You're fired.

22:33.613 --> 22:35.876
What? I don't work for you.

22:35.919 --> 22:37.268
Yeah.

22:37.312 --> 22:38.661
And now you don't work
for Adrienne.

22:38.705 --> 22:40.010
[elevator bell chimes]Oh, look.

22:40.054 --> 22:41.925
Your ride's here.

22:45.233 --> 22:46.756
[sighs]

22:52.327 --> 22:53.546
BULL:
Adrienne.

22:58.159 --> 23:00.466
I think we need to talk.

23:03.425 --> 23:04.992
I promise you, I
didn't have a tremor

23:05.035 --> 23:07.995
during Ruth's surgery or
any surgery I've ever done.

23:10.127 --> 23:11.477
How long have you had them?

23:12.478 --> 23:14.610
They started...
[exhales]

23:14.654 --> 23:16.569
maybe a month
before Ruth's surgery. I...

23:16.612 --> 23:19.572
I only get them at night,
and when I'm really tired.

23:19.615 --> 23:21.269
Like, now.

23:21.312 --> 23:23.837
And all my surgeries
are scheduled for the morning.

23:23.880 --> 23:25.316
Well, if the tremors
never happened in the OR,

23:25.360 --> 23:27.623
then how did Banks
know about them?

23:27.667 --> 23:29.495
I don't know, I-I...
[exhales]

23:29.538 --> 23:30.974
...had one
at a colleague's wedding,

23:31.018 --> 23:33.020
and I didn't think
anybody saw me,

23:33.063 --> 23:36.458
but... clearly, I was wrong.

23:36.502 --> 23:37.590
[laughs softly]

23:37.633 --> 23:40.027
It's been a rough couple years.

23:40.070 --> 23:42.377
The pandemic,
my mother's death, you know.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.466
I'm-I'm sure they're temporary.

23:44.510 --> 23:46.990
And you think this because...?

23:47.034 --> 23:49.471
Well, my medical exam
just came up clean, didn't it?

23:49.515 --> 23:51.604
Adrienne, that's pure luck.
You kn...

23:51.647 --> 23:52.996
You know that.

23:55.042 --> 23:56.652
You swore an oath.

23:56.696 --> 23:58.654
Do no harm. What about that?

23:58.698 --> 24:00.656
You're questioning my oath?

24:02.658 --> 24:05.226
I live by my oath.

24:05.269 --> 24:08.055
I sacrificed everything
to help people,

24:08.098 --> 24:10.144
to be in service of
the sick and the dying.

24:10.187 --> 24:14.714
I gave up having a meaningful
relationship, having children,

24:14.757 --> 24:18.761
all for the privilege
of putting on my white coat.

24:20.676 --> 24:22.330
When I'm in
the operating theater,

24:22.373 --> 24:25.638
I am keenly attuned to my hands.

24:25.681 --> 24:29.293
If I thought for a moment
that I was in jeopardy

24:29.337 --> 24:32.949
of betraying my oath?

24:32.993 --> 24:35.778
I wouldn't have operated.

24:35.822 --> 24:38.346
I would've admitted it.

24:38.389 --> 24:40.043
I would've quit.

24:44.047 --> 24:46.528
Wait, do you believe me?

24:47.921 --> 24:50.358
I believe you, but I can't
put you on the stand,

24:50.401 --> 24:52.186
because if you're saying
that these tremors only happen

24:52.229 --> 24:54.841
outside of the OR,
that is gonna sound to a jury

24:54.884 --> 24:56.799
like we're splitting hairs.

24:57.844 --> 24:59.759
I understand.Good.

25:02.413 --> 25:03.589
What about this?

25:04.590 --> 25:06.200
Second thoughts?

25:07.462 --> 25:09.508
I did not commit malpractice.

25:11.510 --> 25:12.902
Okay, then.

25:12.946 --> 25:16.166
Bull fired Vincent,
so Chunk is taking over

25:16.210 --> 25:17.777
as Adrienne's attorney.

25:17.820 --> 25:20.606
So I won? I won the bet.

25:20.649 --> 25:22.999
Guess you're right about
everything these days.

25:23.043 --> 25:25.959
I have to file the paperwork
to change attorneys,

25:26.002 --> 25:27.787
but Chunk
will take you

25:27.830 --> 25:29.353
through strategy.

25:34.707 --> 25:36.317
You did it, didn't you?

25:36.360 --> 25:38.014
CHUNK:
Did what?

25:38.058 --> 25:40.495
Well, she was the messenger,
and she got shot.

25:40.539 --> 25:42.628
CHUNK:Yeah, I don't know what
any of what that means,

25:42.671 --> 25:45.021
so why don't we just stick
to the case, right?

25:45.065 --> 25:46.762
Bull believes Adrienne
when she says

25:46.806 --> 25:49.330
she didn't have a tremor
during Ruth Synford's surgery.

25:49.373 --> 25:50.984
Do you?I believe
that Adrienne

25:51.027 --> 25:52.681
is our client,
and we are looking

25:52.725 --> 25:53.987
for the best way to defend her.

25:54.030 --> 25:57.120
So, any thoughts?

25:57.164 --> 25:58.382
Taylor?

26:00.036 --> 26:02.865
Um, yeah, is it possible

26:02.909 --> 26:05.215
Banks is covering up
her own negligence?

26:05.259 --> 26:06.347
What do you have?

26:09.872 --> 26:11.613
Over the last year,

26:11.657 --> 26:13.746
Banks has moved departments
within the hospital three times.

26:13.789 --> 26:16.139
First oncology,
then endocrinology,

26:16.183 --> 26:17.532
now cardiology.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.012
How common is that?

26:19.055 --> 26:20.840
It's never happened
at Sacred Heart Hospital,

26:20.883 --> 26:22.711
not in such a short time.

26:22.755 --> 26:24.670
You think she's been passed
around because of sloppy work?

26:24.713 --> 26:27.890
Well, Adrienne called out Banks
for a huge mistake she made.

26:27.934 --> 26:29.892
Could be she has
a history of mistakes.

26:29.936 --> 26:31.677
And when she becomes
the weak link in a department,

26:31.720 --> 26:33.809
they ship her off to become
someone else's problem.

26:33.853 --> 26:35.637
Why not just fire her?

26:35.681 --> 26:38.248
It's hard to justify firing
even a semi-competent nurse.

26:38.292 --> 26:40.947
I'll find out if Banks
wasn't so competent.

26:43.950 --> 26:45.734
[panting]

26:45.778 --> 26:49.042
Hi. Uh, listen,
crisis at work, so I can't stay.

26:49.085 --> 26:50.304
That's fine. You
could've called.

26:50.347 --> 26:53.263
No, I wanted to see you.
In person.

26:54.874 --> 26:57.006
You're married.

26:59.443 --> 27:01.010
Yes.

27:01.054 --> 27:03.273
Uh, but it's a,
it's a long story.

27:03.317 --> 27:04.666
So it's true?

27:04.710 --> 27:06.189
Technically,

27:06.233 --> 27:07.800
but we haven't been together
for many years.

27:07.843 --> 27:09.279
Can you please let me explain?

27:09.323 --> 27:11.760
You have a wife.

27:12.805 --> 27:15.068
We separated five years ago,

27:15.111 --> 27:18.332
but in the midst of the divorce,
she was diagnosed with MS.

27:18.375 --> 27:22.510
So we decided to stay
married, on paper only,

27:22.553 --> 27:24.643
so she could stay on
my health insurance.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.255
Why didn't you tell me?

27:28.298 --> 27:33.695
I was waiting until we'd been
together a bit longer.

27:33.739 --> 27:36.611
I didn't want to overburden
our new relationship

27:36.655 --> 27:38.961
with old wounds.

27:41.660 --> 27:44.271
How is she?

27:44.314 --> 27:45.620
Honestly?

27:45.664 --> 27:47.448
We don't speak very often.
I mean...

27:47.491 --> 27:50.146
I guess she has good days
and bad days.

27:51.147 --> 27:53.367
I'm sorry.

27:53.410 --> 27:55.325
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you sooner.

27:56.718 --> 27:58.807
How did you find out?

27:58.851 --> 28:02.202
[chuckles]: Oh, actually,
it's a bit of a story.

28:02.245 --> 28:04.465
Did you investigate me?

28:04.508 --> 28:06.772
I mean, I...

28:06.815 --> 28:09.775
uh, I asked Taylor to...

28:09.818 --> 28:11.211
Taylor?No, not...

28:11.254 --> 28:13.909
I... It's not her fault.

28:13.953 --> 28:16.433
Yes.

28:16.477 --> 28:18.914
I did a background check on you.

28:21.961 --> 28:23.266
Wow.

28:23.310 --> 28:25.355
[scoffs]

28:27.488 --> 28:29.011
Well...

28:31.840 --> 28:33.799
...I guess neither of us
is having lunch today.

28:33.842 --> 28:35.539
Henri, I...

28:40.806 --> 28:41.763
[exhales]

28:43.330 --> 28:46.899
I've supervised all kinds
of nurses over the years.

28:46.942 --> 28:50.772
At least Banks seemed
to care about her patients.

28:50.816 --> 28:53.993
So there were no issues?
She never made any mistakes?

28:54.036 --> 28:55.516
Oh, I didn't say that.
[chuckles]

28:55.559 --> 28:58.780
She worked oncology
during the pandemic.

28:58.824 --> 29:01.174
It was overwhelming.

29:01.217 --> 29:03.350
A lot of people made mistakes.

29:03.393 --> 29:05.178
So what mistakes did Banks make?

29:06.875 --> 29:09.182
An older patient.

29:09.225 --> 29:11.880
He just had
a kidney tumor removed.

29:11.924 --> 29:13.403
He complained that Banks

29:13.447 --> 29:15.405
tried to give him
the wrong medication.

29:15.449 --> 29:16.450
Had she?

29:16.493 --> 29:18.278
Banks denied it,

29:18.321 --> 29:21.150
and there were no witnesses,
so I could never say for sure

29:21.194 --> 29:22.891
what happened either way.

29:22.935 --> 29:24.458
But that's why
you transferred her?

29:24.501 --> 29:25.981
Oh, I didn't transfer her.

29:26.025 --> 29:28.114
She asked
for that transfer herself.

29:28.157 --> 29:29.898
Why?

29:29.942 --> 29:33.162
She didn't say.
Change of scenery?

29:33.206 --> 29:37.340
But frankly, I was
a little relieved that she did.

29:37.384 --> 29:39.168
Hmm. Thanks.

29:39.212 --> 29:41.823
That's very helpful.

29:41.867 --> 29:43.999
I hear you've been
checking up on me.

29:44.043 --> 29:45.871
Just doing a little
due diligence.

29:45.914 --> 29:48.047
Interrogating my colleagues
isn't due diligence,

29:48.090 --> 29:49.396
it's harassment.

29:49.439 --> 29:50.789
"Interrogating" is a strong...

29:50.832 --> 29:52.878
Surgeons think they're gods.

29:52.921 --> 29:56.011
They can call everyone else
out on their mistakes,

29:56.055 --> 29:58.797
but no one's allowed
to call them out on theirs.

29:58.840 --> 30:01.060
So, are you admitting
you made a mistake?

30:01.103 --> 30:03.932
You're gonna try to make me
out to be the bad guy,

30:03.976 --> 30:07.370
but you know what the irony is?

30:07.414 --> 30:09.155
What's that?

30:09.198 --> 30:13.115
Most surgeons don't even see
their patients as human.

30:15.074 --> 30:16.597
But I do.

30:17.772 --> 30:19.469
Good to know.

30:31.699 --> 30:35.877
And then she gave me this look
that was just chilling.

30:35.921 --> 30:39.272
Okay, a-a chilling look doesn't
make for a legal defense.

30:39.315 --> 30:41.361
DANNY:
I know, but it's
the second time

30:41.404 --> 30:43.929
that Banks nearly
overmedicated a patient.

30:43.972 --> 30:46.235
Once is a mistake,
twice feels like a pattern.

30:46.279 --> 30:48.759
So Danny and I took
a deeper dive

30:48.803 --> 30:52.894
to look at Banks's background
and we've come up with a theory.

30:52.938 --> 30:56.506
But just a warning,
it's a little out there.

30:56.550 --> 30:58.334
Like far, far out.

30:58.378 --> 30:59.988
It's the 11th hour,

31:00.032 --> 31:01.860
and we're the only ones
who can help Adrienne.

31:01.903 --> 31:03.992
I'll go to Pluto if I have to.

31:04.036 --> 31:06.647
All right. Take a look at this.

31:10.216 --> 31:11.434
CHUNK:Okay, what are
we looking at?

31:11.478 --> 31:12.479
TAYLOR:
We cross-referenced

31:12.522 --> 31:14.002
the three times Banks

31:14.046 --> 31:15.482
transferred departments
to a list of deaths

31:15.525 --> 31:16.831
in those departments.

31:16.875 --> 31:19.007
Within a month prior
to each transfer,

31:19.051 --> 31:21.140
there was a death
of an elderly patient

31:21.183 --> 31:22.793
with a similar profile
to Ruth Synford.

31:22.837 --> 31:24.621
TAYLOR:All were over 70,
all lived alone,

31:24.665 --> 31:26.362
and while they had chronic
health conditions,

31:26.406 --> 31:27.886
were expected
to make full recoveries.

31:27.929 --> 31:29.496
BULL:
And let me guess,

31:29.539 --> 31:31.933
Banks was on duty
when all three deaths happened.

31:31.977 --> 31:34.327
She was the head nurse
in each of their surgeries.

31:34.370 --> 31:35.981
And she specifically
requested overtime

31:36.024 --> 31:38.461
so she could supervise
their aftercare in the ICU.

31:38.505 --> 31:40.115
CHUNK:Wait, y-you two
are proposing

31:40.159 --> 31:42.509
that she killed them?
On purpose?

31:42.552 --> 31:44.903
Yes. That is our theory.

31:44.946 --> 31:47.340
You think we got
a Charles Cullen on our hands?

31:47.383 --> 31:48.558
Maybe.

31:48.602 --> 31:49.995
Who's Charles Cullen?

31:50.038 --> 31:52.867
A so-called angel of mercy
serial killer.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.347
A critical care nurse
in New Jersey who murdered

31:54.390 --> 31:56.001
hundreds of patients
for almost two decades,

31:56.044 --> 31:58.046
going from one intensive care
unit to the next.

31:58.090 --> 32:01.745
He said he did it to
ease his patients' suffering.

32:01.789 --> 32:04.052
Okay, but I'm gonna need
more than ghost stories

32:04.096 --> 32:05.532
to bring to court.

32:05.575 --> 32:07.186
So, if Banks was killing
these patients,

32:07.229 --> 32:09.188
do we have any ideas
how she did it?

32:09.231 --> 32:10.885
That's where
it gets tough to prove.

32:10.929 --> 32:12.887
If she did this, she knows
how to cover her tracks.

32:12.931 --> 32:14.193
CHUNK:
Is there any proof

32:14.236 --> 32:15.672
that Banks was in
Ruth Synford's room

32:15.716 --> 32:16.847
at the time of her death?

32:16.891 --> 32:18.501
TAYLOR:
I'm working on it.

32:18.545 --> 32:20.547
There are cameras in all
the hallways in the hospital,

32:20.590 --> 32:23.724
but their security network is
locked up tighter than the NSA.

32:25.900 --> 32:28.424
You know who could
probably get us access?

32:29.773 --> 32:32.037
Yeah, I know.

32:32.080 --> 32:33.777
I just wish I didn't
have to ask him.

32:45.964 --> 32:47.748
Oh. Hey.

32:47.791 --> 32:49.924
Sorry to stop by so late. Um...

32:52.100 --> 32:54.015
What do you want?

32:54.059 --> 32:55.930
Ah.

32:55.974 --> 32:58.802
So, we're just gonna
do this here?

33:00.761 --> 33:02.154
Okay.

33:02.197 --> 33:05.940
Well, I have reason to believe

33:05.984 --> 33:10.118
that the nurse Lisa Banks
killed Ruth Synford

33:10.162 --> 33:13.252
and two other patients.

33:14.296 --> 33:16.820
[scoffs]
Two other patients?

33:16.864 --> 33:18.735
What-what the hell
are you talking about?

33:19.823 --> 33:22.261
Murder, possibly.

33:22.304 --> 33:24.915
Uh, I don't know
what game you're playing,

33:24.959 --> 33:27.048
but I'm going back to bed.

33:27.092 --> 33:30.704
[whispers]:
Listen. I need your help.

33:33.620 --> 33:36.536
I need you to get us access
to the hospital footage

33:36.579 --> 33:39.452
of the CICU in the minutes
before Ruth's death.

33:42.150 --> 33:44.370
I'm gonna ask you this
with all the respect

33:44.413 --> 33:49.070
I can muster at this hour:
have you lost your mind?

33:49.114 --> 33:50.985
I assure you, it tracks.

33:53.031 --> 33:56.251
Okay, let's assume it does--

33:56.295 --> 33:58.340
and that's
a gigantic assumption--

33:58.384 --> 34:00.168
do you know
what you're asking me?

34:00.212 --> 34:02.692
Trust me, I wouldn't
be here if I didn't.

34:02.736 --> 34:03.867
Giving you access

34:03.911 --> 34:06.218
to hospital security footage

34:06.261 --> 34:07.697
could open the door
to more lawsuits.

34:07.741 --> 34:09.482
You think Sacred Heart Hospital

34:09.525 --> 34:12.833
is going to willingly expose
themselves to those liabilities?

34:12.876 --> 34:14.704
Well, imagine the liabilities
if they turn a blind eye

34:14.748 --> 34:16.619
to a serial killer.

34:16.663 --> 34:19.840
Now, if I'm wrong,

34:19.883 --> 34:23.539
think of how much fun
you'll have humiliating me.

34:25.541 --> 34:26.847
[gavel bangs]

34:26.890 --> 34:28.849
Your Honor,
the defense would like

34:28.892 --> 34:31.895
to recall Lisa Banks
to the stand.

34:31.939 --> 34:34.376
Ms. Banks,
you testified

34:34.420 --> 34:37.292
that you witnessed Dr. Corbett
having a tremor

34:37.336 --> 34:39.686
during Ruth Synford's surgery,
is that correct?

34:39.729 --> 34:41.862
Yes, I did.And it's your opinion

34:41.905 --> 34:44.865
that tremor caused Ms. Synford
to go into V-fib,

34:44.908 --> 34:46.040
is that correct?

34:46.084 --> 34:48.042
Yes.

34:48.086 --> 34:50.697
Are there any other reasons why
a patient would go into V-fib?

34:50.740 --> 34:53.047
Of course.

34:53.091 --> 34:55.876
Could a medication,
like magnesium sulfate,

34:55.919 --> 34:58.096
trigger a V-fib episode?

34:59.097 --> 35:01.186
I suppose so, yes.

35:01.229 --> 35:03.101
And is it true
that magnesium sulfate

35:03.144 --> 35:06.539
doesn't show up
in a standard autopsy?

35:06.582 --> 35:09.368
I don't know.
I'm not a medical examiner.

35:09.411 --> 35:10.934
Well,
for your information,

35:10.978 --> 35:12.936
no, it does not show up
in a standard autopsy,

35:12.980 --> 35:17.202
but I have a feeling that
you knew that already, right?

35:17.245 --> 35:18.420
JILL:
Objection, Your Honor.

35:18.464 --> 35:20.466
Counsel is testifying.

35:20.509 --> 35:22.294
I'm sorry, Your Honor,
I'll move on.

35:23.295 --> 35:24.339
Your Honor,
the defense would like

35:24.383 --> 35:26.211
to enter into evidence

35:26.254 --> 35:28.387
security footage
from the CICU

35:28.430 --> 35:30.258
the night
that Ruth Synford died.

35:30.302 --> 35:32.521
Your Honor,
we haven't had a chance

35:32.565 --> 35:34.175
to authenticate this footage.

35:34.219 --> 35:35.698
CHUNK:
I can assure the court

35:35.742 --> 35:37.178
that this video comes directly

35:37.222 --> 35:38.875
from New York
Sacred Heart Hospital

35:38.919 --> 35:40.181
via their legal counsel.

35:40.225 --> 35:41.487
He's in the courtroom today

35:41.530 --> 35:42.662
if you'd like him
to authenticate it

35:42.705 --> 35:44.185
before we move on.

35:44.229 --> 35:45.099
CARTER:Uh, that won't
be necessary.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.144
I'll allow it.

35:46.187 --> 35:47.580
Uh, proceed, Counselor.

35:49.669 --> 35:50.887
CHUNK:
Ms. Banks, can you tell us

35:50.931 --> 35:52.715
what kind of cart this is?

35:52.759 --> 35:54.239
BANKS:
It's a crash cart.

35:54.282 --> 35:55.544
It's kept in the CICU

35:55.588 --> 35:57.155
because it contains
equipment needed

35:57.198 --> 36:01.246
when patients go into
cardiac pulmonary arrest.

36:01.289 --> 36:03.335
Do crash carts
contain medications,

36:03.378 --> 36:05.250
such as magnesium sulfate?

36:05.293 --> 36:06.947
Sometimes.

36:06.990 --> 36:08.078
In fact, in the video,

36:08.122 --> 36:09.254
we can see you
taking medications

36:09.297 --> 36:10.342
from this cart.

36:10.385 --> 36:11.865
Why is that?

36:11.908 --> 36:14.259
It's protocol to move
certain medications

36:14.302 --> 36:16.261
off the crash cart
depending on which patients

36:16.304 --> 36:18.350
are housed in the CICU.

36:18.393 --> 36:20.352
But standard protocol
would require you to bring

36:20.395 --> 36:23.529
that medication back to the
hospital pharmacy, would it not?

36:23.572 --> 36:25.444
Yes.

36:25.487 --> 36:28.403
But you didn't take it back
to the pharmacy.

36:29.622 --> 36:32.451
You took that medication
into a patient's room.

36:32.494 --> 36:34.322
Why did you do that?

36:35.367 --> 36:36.977
I meant to take it
to the pharmacy,

36:37.020 --> 36:38.457
but there was an emergency.

36:38.500 --> 36:39.980
That's Ruth Synford's room.

36:40.023 --> 36:43.331
She went into V-fib
and I rushed to help her.

36:43.375 --> 36:48.815
Actually, Ruth Synford went
into V-fib at 10:57 p.m.,

36:48.858 --> 36:53.298
You went into Ruth Synford's
room at 10:54 p.m.

36:53.341 --> 36:55.387
[exhales]So can you explain
to us why

36:55.430 --> 36:57.911
you would take medications
from that crash cart

36:57.954 --> 36:59.391
into the patient's room

36:59.434 --> 37:02.045
three minutes
before she went into V-fib?

37:02.089 --> 37:03.221
I...
[laughs softly]

37:03.264 --> 37:05.223
I-I don't recall.Isn't it true

37:05.266 --> 37:08.487
that you injected Ruth Synford
with magnesium sulfate,

37:08.530 --> 37:09.488
Your Honor, objection.sending her into V-fib...

37:09.531 --> 37:10.663
JILL:
Speculation.

37:10.706 --> 37:11.925
...and killing her?

37:11.968 --> 37:14.580
No one was there for her but me.

37:14.623 --> 37:16.103
[hushed chatter]

37:16.146 --> 37:18.148
CHUNK:What?

37:18.192 --> 37:21.282
No one was there for Ruth

37:21.326 --> 37:24.546
before her surgery,
or after...

37:26.069 --> 37:29.986
...when she was scared,
frightened for her life.

37:30.030 --> 37:34.556
And I made sure that she was
not alone when she died.

37:48.875 --> 37:50.877
In light
of Ms. Banks's testimony

37:50.920 --> 37:52.618
and the hospital security video,

37:52.661 --> 37:55.011
we are dropping our
case against Dr. Corbett

37:55.055 --> 37:57.536
and recommending the NYPD do
an immediate investigation

37:57.579 --> 37:59.364
of Lisa Banks.

37:59.407 --> 38:02.062
We'll provide the authorities
with any assistance we can.

38:02.105 --> 38:04.717
I'm so very sorry for your loss.

38:04.760 --> 38:07.285
Thank you.

38:09.243 --> 38:12.725
Ah. If you would all
excuse me for a moment.

38:13.726 --> 38:15.945
[elevator bell chimes]

38:15.989 --> 38:18.208
Mr. Vincent.

38:18.252 --> 38:19.558
[elevator bell chiming]

38:20.820 --> 38:24.171
[exhales]
I just wanted to say thank you.

38:24.214 --> 38:26.956
Yeah, you owe me one.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.308
And something tells me you're
never gonna let me forget it.

38:36.401 --> 38:37.619
[knocks on door]

38:38.577 --> 38:40.187
I'm sorry.

38:40.230 --> 38:41.536
Taylor...

38:41.580 --> 38:43.321
No, please,
just let me say this.

38:45.932 --> 38:48.717
You've been there for me
through a lot.

38:48.761 --> 38:50.937
I don't know how I would've
gotten through my custody battle

38:50.980 --> 38:53.026
without you to lean on.

38:53.069 --> 38:54.810
And I know

38:54.854 --> 38:57.639
you asked me to stand down
from the Henri investigation,

38:57.683 --> 38:59.859
and I absolutely should have,

38:59.902 --> 39:03.253
no question,
but I found out

39:03.297 --> 39:07.257
already that he was married,
and I thought for sure

39:07.301 --> 39:09.956
I'd find out he was divorced,
but I didn't.

39:09.999 --> 39:13.133
And I just wanted
to be there for you

39:13.176 --> 39:16.789
the same way that you'd
been there for me

39:16.832 --> 39:21.402
and I got lost in it,
and I'm really, really sorry.

39:21.446 --> 39:25.972
I know your heart
was in the right place,

39:26.015 --> 39:29.802
but if I am ever going to have
a successful relationship again,

39:29.845 --> 39:32.979
I've got to trust
my own judgment.

39:33.022 --> 39:36.852
And to have my friend
second-guess me was hurtful.

39:36.896 --> 39:38.941
I get that completely.

39:38.985 --> 39:40.421
It's probably how Henri felt

39:40.465 --> 39:43.119
when he found out
I looked into him.

39:43.163 --> 39:45.513
Wait, you feel bad for Henri?

39:45.557 --> 39:48.995
Everything isn't
as clear-cut as it seems.

39:50.431 --> 39:52.477
Okay.

39:52.520 --> 39:54.479
Anyway, I've got my work
cut out for me

39:54.522 --> 39:56.959
if I want to win back his trust.

39:57.003 --> 39:59.701
And what about me?

39:59.745 --> 40:03.183
How much work do I have to do
to win back your trust?

40:03.226 --> 40:05.838
We'll be okay.

40:05.881 --> 40:08.188
I might just need a minute.

40:08.231 --> 40:10.233
Take all the minutes you need.

40:15.064 --> 40:19.547
Maybe we should make a pact
not to make any more pacts.

40:20.548 --> 40:22.071
Absolutely.

40:26.249 --> 40:28.643
Jason.

40:28.687 --> 40:30.340
Hey.

40:30.384 --> 40:32.081
Thank you.

40:32.125 --> 40:34.040
For not giving up on me.

40:34.083 --> 40:38.784
Well, like I said,
I owe you my life.

40:40.742 --> 40:42.701
You think I should retire.

40:42.744 --> 40:47.227
A very wise woman
once told me I'd be different

40:47.270 --> 40:50.230
on the other side of surgery,
and you know what?

40:50.273 --> 40:53.451
She was right. I am.

40:53.494 --> 40:58.368
Because I have a loving wife
and a beautiful daughter.

40:58.412 --> 41:00.893
And that is all
thanks to you.

41:00.936 --> 41:02.285
And all I'm saying is

41:02.329 --> 41:04.549
you don't know
what's waiting for you

41:04.592 --> 41:06.725
on the other side of this.

41:06.768 --> 41:08.248
No, I don't want
a different life.

41:08.291 --> 41:10.642
I don't want to be
a different person.

41:10.685 --> 41:13.862
I sacrificed everything
to be a doctor.

41:13.906 --> 41:15.821
I'm not ready to give it up.

41:15.864 --> 41:20.739
I just think it's important you
address these health issues.

41:20.782 --> 41:24.090
I-I'm going to get
to the bottom of this tremor,

41:24.133 --> 41:28.660
and get better
and get back in the OR.

41:29.661 --> 41:31.532
I wish you all the best.

41:31.576 --> 41:33.578
Kiss that daughter of yours
for me, will you?

41:33.621 --> 41:35.188
I will.
