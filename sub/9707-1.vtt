<i>All right,
bowl bid ridin' here for ESU.</i>

00:25.906 --> 00:29.307
<i>Fourth down on the Georgia Tech 18.
Four ticks left.</i>

00:29.376 --> 00:31.970
<i>- Set!
- Kane sets 'em down.</i>

00:41.922 --> 00:44.413
Blue 80!

00:46.727 --> 00:48.922
Blue 80!

00:48.995 --> 00:51.429
Hut!

00:57.804 --> 01:00.398
- Arrgh!
- Uuh!

01:04.244 --> 01:06.610
- Huuh!
- Aah!

01:21.161 --> 01:23.095
Uuh!

01:27.200 --> 01:31.261
<i>Shit!</i>

01:38.845 --> 01:42.042
<i>Coach, this is the second year in a
row you've failed to go to a bowl game.</i>

01:42.115 --> 01:44.811
Do you feel your program's
in decline?

01:44.885 --> 01:49.515
I think we have a young team
on the verge.

01:49.589 --> 01:52.353
We'll be goin' to
a major bowl next year.

01:54.594 --> 01:56.721
<i>Coach, there are rumors
that you might be replaced...</i>

01:56.797 --> 02:00.392
<i>- if you fail to get to a bowl game again next year.
- Hey, Joe.</i>

02:00.467 --> 02:03.163
Good throw.
It was there.

02:04.271 --> 02:07.502
Another year home
for Christmas.

02:07.574 --> 02:10.839
Next year...
Next year we sell out.

02:10.911 --> 02:13.880
<i>Next year we dominate.!</i>

02:13.947 --> 02:17.439
<i>You still need a deep threat or a
breakaway back to go with Joe Kane.</i>

02:17.517 --> 02:20.179
So, what are you gonna do
to address this need?

02:20.253 --> 02:23.416
Well, stop wastin' my time
talkin' to you guys, for one thing.

02:23.490 --> 02:26.459
Coach, any media...

02:28.128 --> 02:30.858
<i>I'm not going to lead you
into the fog here, Sam.</i>

02:30.931 --> 02:33.422
I'm concerned
about our program.

02:33.500 --> 02:37.129
It's always been a source of pride
to our students and alumni.

02:37.204 --> 02:39.866
Two so-so seasons is having a
damaging effect on our fund-raising,

02:39.940 --> 02:41.874
both public and private.

02:41.942 --> 02:46.140
Just let me get this straight. What
you're trying to say here, Grant...

02:46.213 --> 02:48.613
is that after 12 years,
my job's in jeopardy.

02:48.682 --> 02:52.584
I'm not prepared to discuss
your job right now.

02:52.652 --> 02:55.177
I just want you to be aware
of the situation.

02:55.255 --> 02:57.849
The alumni and the legislature
are unappy...

02:57.924 --> 03:00.290
<i>and they vote
with their checkbooks.</i>

03:00.360 --> 03:02.851
<i>I don't pretend to be
an expert on football, Sam,</i>

03:02.929 --> 03:07.059
but I do know
we need to win next year.

03:08.735 --> 03:10.669
<i>Tickets are in your bag.</i>

03:10.737 --> 03:13.228
Itinerary and player profiles
are in your briefcase.

03:13.306 --> 03:16.332
You've got a 9:00 tomorrow
morning in Philly with this kid,

03:16.409 --> 03:18.309
<i>Darnell Jefferson.</i>

03:18.378 --> 03:22.405
<i>Damn. Looks like I lost
some weight.</i>

03:22.482 --> 03:26.748
This kid could be the game-breaker
we're looking for.

03:26.820 --> 03:29.880
He had a 108-yard
kickoff return against Taft.

03:29.956 --> 03:33.153
Michigars been down
to see him twice.

03:33.226 --> 03:35.694
- What was the name of that high school again?
- Taft.

03:35.762 --> 03:37.389
Taft.

03:37.464 --> 03:41.366
<i>Now, Darnell, you have the potential
to start for us as a freshman.</i>

03:41.434 --> 03:43.766
<i>That 108-yard kickoff return
you made against Taft?</i>

03:43.837 --> 03:45.771
That was probably
one of the greatest runs...

03:45.839 --> 03:48.103
I've ever seen
a high school player make.

03:48.174 --> 03:50.108
Now,

03:50.176 --> 03:52.110
Michigan, they're set.

03:52.178 --> 03:54.112
A tailback for two years.

03:54.180 --> 03:55.340
But with us and Joe, here,

03:55.415 --> 03:58.578
getting you the ball
in our thunder right.

03:58.652 --> 04:02.247
Ah, hell... Excuse me, Reverend.

04:02.322 --> 04:05.553
You could be an All-American
by your sophomore year.

04:05.625 --> 04:08.526
Yes, but I'm more concerned
with Darnell's education.

04:08.595 --> 04:11.223
He came here late.
He's got some catchin' up to do.

04:11.298 --> 04:15.735
Well, education is the first
priority of our program.

04:15.802 --> 04:18.635
That's why all my players are
smarter than me.

04:25.045 --> 04:27.536
<i>Merry Christmas, Mama.</i>

04:37.457 --> 04:40.324
It's very pretty, Alvin.

04:40.393 --> 04:44.830
<i>When I turn pro, I'm gonna get
you the house to go with it.</i>

04:46.700 --> 04:48.930
Thank you, son.

04:49.002 --> 04:51.493
<i>Runnin' low on brew.</i>

04:51.571 --> 04:55.029
Didrt expect you
home this year, Joe.

04:55.108 --> 04:59.772
- Wort be here next year.
- Yeah, well, we won't rent your place on the couch.

05:03.083 --> 05:05.108
Merry Christmas, Dad.

05:05.185 --> 05:07.312
Yeah,
merry fuckin' Christmas.

05:12.792 --> 05:16.228
<i>Woo, hey, ESU
Wejust wanna welcome you</i>

05:16.296 --> 05:19.629
<i>Darnell, ESU Wejust wanna welcome you</i>

05:19.699 --> 05:23.191
Darnell, ESU We just wanna welcome you

05:23.269 --> 05:26.602
Darnell, ESU We just wanna welcome you

05:26.673 --> 05:31.110
Darnell, ESU We just wanna welcome you

05:33.179 --> 05:36.706
- Hey, man, good to see you again. Welcome to ESU.
- Glad to be here, man.

05:36.783 --> 05:40.651
I got somebody I'd like you
to meet. This is Autumn Haley,

05:40.720 --> 05:43.951
and, uh, she'll be
showin' you around.

05:44.024 --> 05:46.458
- Hi, Darnell.
- How you doin' ?

05:46.526 --> 05:49.552
- It's nice to meet you.
- The pleasure's all mine.

06:00.407 --> 06:02.841
This is it:
Wolf Den Stadium.

06:03.910 --> 06:05.844
Damn!

06:09.349 --> 06:13.183
<i>Now for the starting lineup
for the ESU Timberwolves.</i>

06:13.253 --> 06:18.156
<i>At tailback, number 20,
Darnell Jefferson.</i>

06:18.224 --> 06:23.491
<i>They got that right.</i>

06:23.563 --> 06:26.430
Yo, thanks for showing me
around the campus.

06:26.499 --> 06:30.128
I don't get the chance to meet
too many girls like you.

06:30.203 --> 06:33.172
You got a lot of class.
Real efficacious.

06:33.239 --> 06:35.230
Thank you.

06:35.308 --> 06:39.210
You're welcome. Hope I can see you
in the fall.

06:39.279 --> 06:41.213
Me too.

06:44.984 --> 06:48.954
Good night.

06:55.028 --> 06:56.962
<i>ESU is where I'm goin' </i>

06:57.030 --> 07:00.761
I'll be number 20, but we're
indubitably gonna be number one.

07:22.922 --> 07:27.291
- Hey, man, good to see ya. How you doin' ?
- What's up? All right.

07:27.360 --> 07:29.419
This is Bud-Lite Kaminski,
DarnellJefferson.

07:29.496 --> 07:31.987
- How you doin' ? Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

07:32.065 --> 07:34.397
- Let's head out.
- Hey, I got a question for you, man.

07:34.467 --> 07:36.901
- What's that?
- What happened to the band and the dancin' honeys...

07:36.970 --> 07:38.995
and all that good shit y'all
used to make me come here?

07:39.072 --> 07:41.006
Oh, yeah, well, uh...

07:41.074 --> 07:44.305
Uh, regular students don't come
back for another two weeks, so, ah...

07:44.377 --> 07:46.311
Not that they
would be here anyway.

07:46.379 --> 07:48.313
See, ah,
we got you now, so, ah...

07:48.381 --> 07:51.214
- Just another wormshit freshman, man.
- Oh, I see how it goes.

07:51.284 --> 07:53.343
- Welcome to college.
- Ha-ha!

08:04.230 --> 08:06.494
- Hi!
- Hey, Joe.

08:06.566 --> 08:08.500
- Hey, Mary.
- Hey, Joe!

08:08.568 --> 08:11.594
<i>- Goddamn, the lead dog is back.
- How's it goin' ?</i>

08:11.671 --> 08:14.572
There goes my cover
of the media, guys.

08:14.641 --> 08:17.405
- That's DarnellJefferson. Bobby, Lat.
- Hello.

08:17.477 --> 08:19.775
Hey, Josie, can I get
a couple ofTequilas? Thanks.

08:19.846 --> 08:23.577
Hey, Joe, you know, I was hoping you might've
rolled your bike or something this summer.

08:23.650 --> 08:28.053
You know, nothing serious, just
enough to keep you out for the season.

08:28.121 --> 08:30.282
Well, no such luck,
backup man.

08:30.356 --> 08:34.121
But, um, perhaps could engineer a few
blowouts, give you a little mop-up time.

08:34.193 --> 08:36.457
Much obliged, Joe.

08:36.529 --> 08:39.657
My God, Lats,
you put on some weight, huh?

08:39.732 --> 08:41.962
- Gained about 35 pounds.
- Shee!

08:42.034 --> 08:46.995
Tried of watchin' you guys play, so I spent my
summer in the gym. I intend to start this year.

08:47.073 --> 08:49.166
You get any bigger,
you can play offense.

08:49.242 --> 08:51.642
Yeah, but don't I have
to get dumber then too?

08:51.711 --> 08:54.077
<i>Is that really possible?</i>

08:54.147 --> 08:57.674
<i>Here's to a new season.
- Come on.</i>

08:58.985 --> 09:01.044
Hey, you still seein'
Louanne?

09:01.120 --> 09:05.181
Uh, yeah. Now and then,
you know, when the tide rises.

09:05.258 --> 09:09.058
Don't want her thinkin' it's some
kind of exclusive deal, now, do I?

09:09.128 --> 09:11.926
Coach finds out your nailin' his daughter,
you're gonna be playin' dorm ball, buddy.

09:11.998 --> 09:16.025
I'll bail before that. 'Sides, that's
what coach gets for not startin' me.

09:16.102 --> 09:19.230
<i>- You never learn, do you, Collins?
- Heh! See you boys.</i>

09:19.305 --> 09:22.797
- It's pathetic.
- Alvin.

09:22.876 --> 09:26.710
- Hey, dog, have you seen this?
- Oh, my God!

09:26.779 --> 09:31.546
<i>- You must be one badass motherfucker.!
- Like you didn't know!</i>

09:31.618 --> 09:34.712
I knew there was gonna be an article.
I just didn't know it was out already.

09:34.787 --> 09:37.255
<i>Shit.! We do all the work
and you get all the pub.</i>

09:37.323 --> 09:39.314
Too bad we ain't allowed
to hit you in practice.

09:39.392 --> 09:42.828
Be fun to kick the shit
out of a Heisman Trophy candidate!

09:42.896 --> 09:46.263
- Yeah, maybe you'll get your shot
in the pro's, huh? - Uh-hoo! Damn!

09:46.332 --> 09:50.962
Hey, beer boy, gimme some peanuts.

09:51.037 --> 09:53.597
- Are you serious?
- Does it look like I'm serious?

09:53.673 --> 09:57.200
This is one of those
rookie things, right?

10:02.482 --> 10:04.416
<i>Listen to this.;</i>

10:04.484 --> 10:08.750
<i>"ESU has a solid nucleus
returning. But the Timberwolves,</i>

10:08.821 --> 10:11.790
"coming off two disappointing
seasons, will only go as far...

10:11.858 --> 10:16.295
as the strong right arm of Heisman
candidateJoe Kane will take them. "

10:16.362 --> 10:20.890
Is that right, Joey? You gonna lead
us to the promised land like that says?

10:20.967 --> 10:22.901
Oh, yeah,
I'm gonna lead.

10:22.969 --> 10:27.235
<i>- Question is, can you
boys follow? - Ooh-ooh-ooh.!</i>

10:27.307 --> 10:29.901
Autumn!
Yo, Autumn, wait up!

10:29.976 --> 10:33.173
<i>- It's me, Darnell!
- Hey, Darnell.</i>

10:33.246 --> 10:35.544
Whatcha doin' here? I thought the
students hadrt come back for two weeks.

10:35.615 --> 10:37.845
- I came back early to see a friend.
- That's cool.

10:37.917 --> 10:41.182
And if I may say so myself,
you are looking good!

10:41.254 --> 10:43.814
You look like the package of pulchritudinous,
girl. Let's get together later tonight.

10:43.890 --> 10:45.824
Let's get some pizza, let's
kick it, let's just hang out.

10:45.892 --> 10:49.055
- I can't tonight.
- What about tomorrow night then?

10:49.128 --> 10:52.689
Darnell, I don't think it's a real
good idea that we see each other.

10:52.765 --> 10:56.223
What, I'm not good enough for you all
of a sudden? I'm too young, that's it.

10:56.302 --> 10:58.702
I'm not as young as you think I am.
They held me back a year, you know.

10:58.771 --> 11:03.231
- That's not it.
- What is it then?

11:03.309 --> 11:06.073
I have a boyfriend.

11:06.145 --> 11:09.876
Did you have this boyfriend
when you showed me around?

11:09.949 --> 11:11.883
Yes.

11:11.951 --> 11:14.977
Well, um, it didn't seem
to bother you then.

11:15.054 --> 11:18.581
- I'm willing to overlook it now.
- I was mad at him then.

11:18.658 --> 11:23.027
- For what?
- I caught him with another girl.

11:23.096 --> 11:25.326
- A white girl.
- A white girl?

11:25.398 --> 11:28.026
You're still with this nigger?
You won't gimme no play?

11:28.101 --> 11:30.501
Look, Darnell,
I'm really sorry.

11:30.570 --> 11:35.735
I didn't mean to lead you on in any
way, but I'm really glad you came here.

11:35.808 --> 11:38.242
See ya.

11:40.046 --> 11:42.071
Wait, hold up,
hold up, hold up!

11:42.148 --> 11:44.309
I can at least walk with you, can't I?
Ain't no crime in that.

11:44.384 --> 11:47.911
- I'm in a hurry.
- I can keep up. I run the 40 in 4.3.

11:47.987 --> 11:50.182
- Woo-ha-he!
- Hey, Autumn.

11:50.256 --> 11:52.190
- Hey, Ray.
- Where you been?

11:52.258 --> 11:54.783
I was just talking to a friend of mine.
Ray, this is...

11:54.861 --> 11:56.795
DarnellJefferson,
tailback.

11:56.863 --> 11:59.297
Ray Griffen,
starting tailback.

11:59.365 --> 12:01.265
Yeah, I know.
That's why they recruited me.

12:01.334 --> 12:04.428
<i>The two boys they recruited
before you are washing cars now.</i>

12:04.504 --> 12:08.099
- You better start strengthenin' your wrist.
- Huh!

12:08.174 --> 12:10.199
This guy's kinda funny.

12:10.276 --> 12:13.734
Listen, man, just make sure and give
your best to Miss Lily for me, all right?

12:13.813 --> 12:16.247
Stay black, bro!

12:17.683 --> 12:20.914
What in the hell
is that supposed to mean?

12:20.987 --> 12:24.889
<i>Twenty-one minutes remaining
in math section two.</i>

12:24.957 --> 12:27.653
<i>Twenty-one minutes.</i>

12:33.366 --> 12:38.429
Hey, when are we gettin' them
scores back on our placement test?

12:38.504 --> 12:41.337
Who cares?
I flunked three times before I got in.

12:41.407 --> 12:43.773
<i>Long as you in the program,
they'll get you through.</i>

12:43.843 --> 12:46.539
Maybe not with a degree, but
they're gonna keep you eligible.

12:46.612 --> 12:49.638
Just don't do nothin' embarrassin'
they can't cover you for.

12:49.715 --> 12:52.946
Hell, they even give Alvin here
copies of his test in advance.

12:53.019 --> 12:57.012
<i>Sells 'em for 100 bucks a pop
to people in his class.</i>

12:57.090 --> 12:59.115
'Course he, ah, still gotta have
somebody read 'em to 'im!

12:59.192 --> 13:05.062
Fuck you, doughboy, I can read!
See that shoe? It says "Adidas. "

13:05.131 --> 13:07.031
I taught him that.

13:09.402 --> 13:13.065
Still, don't know, man.
Promised the Rev I'd get a degree.

13:13.139 --> 13:15.073
I don't wanna
let him down.

13:15.141 --> 13:18.542
What do you think, nigger?
You gonna be on the Supreme Court?

13:18.611 --> 13:23.412
All you need to know
is how to sign an NFL contract.

13:23.483 --> 13:27.180
<i>- Period.
- Yup, yup.</i>

13:27.253 --> 13:29.517
<i>I think both Joe and the
university are best served...</i>

13:29.589 --> 13:32.820
by a straightforward Heisman
campaign; nothing too gimmicky.

13:32.892 --> 13:37.829
<i>In order to capitalize on the momentum
created by the Sports Illustrated cover,</i>

13:37.897 --> 13:41.264
we've compiled a mailing list
of around 1,300 opinion makers:

13:41.334 --> 13:44.326
Newspapers, football writers,
sports anchors.

13:44.403 --> 13:47.236
First we send them a packet
on Joe and his achievements:

13:47.306 --> 13:49.433
Bio, stats,
plus human interest stuff;

13:49.509 --> 13:52.478
committed to academics,
charity work, etc.

13:52.545 --> 13:57.949
Then we update it each week with a postcard.
Heisman voters hate opening envelopes.

13:58.017 --> 14:00.577
You really think
this is won'th it?

14:00.653 --> 14:03.884
I mean, you think I got a shot
at winning this thing?

14:03.956 --> 14:06.117
<i>Certainly.!</i>

14:06.192 --> 14:08.786
Plus, it's a good thing
for the program.

14:08.861 --> 14:11.295
Publicizes the school,
gives a boost to recruiting...

14:11.364 --> 14:14.299
And it's a great thing for you.
Jumps up your draft position,

14:14.367 --> 14:16.767
the size of your
first contract, everything.

14:16.836 --> 14:20.397
- It's a great opportunity.
- And all you gotta do is back it up on the field.

14:20.473 --> 14:24.239
<i>And we have no doubts
about that, 'cause we know...</i>

14:26.045 --> 14:28.206
"Kane is Able. "

14:28.281 --> 14:30.977
<i>Break!</i>

14:31.050 --> 14:33.211
Play Ball!

14:33.286 --> 14:36.813
No, no, no. Keep that index finger
on the ball. On the ball, all right?

14:36.889 --> 14:40.052
<i>Joe's too pumped up, tryin' to win
a Heisman on every damned throw.</i>

14:40.126 --> 14:43.926
- I don't think he's ready for all this hype.
- Little late to worry now.

14:43.996 --> 14:46.260
<i>If we don't do
something to follow up...</i>

14:46.332 --> 14:48.766
<i>that Sports Illustrated cover, it's gonna
look like we don't believe in our peers.</i>

14:48.834 --> 14:51.769
Hey, you let me worry
about it, please?

14:51.837 --> 14:54.567
Yeah!

14:54.640 --> 14:59.577
Set! Blue 80!
Blue 80! Hike!

15:04.150 --> 15:06.243
Hah!

15:06.319 --> 15:08.253
Uuh!

15:08.321 --> 15:10.448
Huuuuhh!

15:10.523 --> 15:12.991
Too high, big boy.
So long, sucker.

15:13.059 --> 15:16.620
- Yeah!
- Comin' to get ya, field boy!

15:16.696 --> 15:19.859
- Come on. Yeah!
- Lights out, baby!

15:24.237 --> 15:26.171
<i>Lattimer.!</i>

15:27.006 --> 15:29.133
Whaddya...

15:29.208 --> 15:31.642
You cut out that
necktie tackle crap.

15:31.711 --> 15:35.272
What're you tryin' to do, make a highlight
reel, huh? That man left you huggin' air!

15:35.348 --> 15:38.215
You take this helmet and you put
it right in his numbers, okay?

15:38.284 --> 15:42.778
Drive it through his guts. I don't wanna
see nothin' but snot bubbles in his nose.

15:42.855 --> 15:46.347
<i>All right, let's move that drill down
15 yards, let's go. Come on, boys.</i>

15:46.425 --> 15:50.384
<i>All right, let's go.
Let's move it guys.</i>

15:53.532 --> 15:58.162
- Jefferson, are you injured or are you hurt?
- What does that mean?

15:58.237 --> 16:02.731
Well, if you're hurt, you can still
play. If you're injured, you can't.

16:02.808 --> 16:04.799
So are you hurt
or are you injured?

16:04.877 --> 16:07.072
Uuuh,
think I'm just hurt.

16:07.146 --> 16:10.343
That's good.
Then get up.

16:10.416 --> 16:13.078
Oh, shit!

16:13.152 --> 16:16.883
Now, that was a hell of a run
you just made.

16:16.956 --> 16:19.516
Think how good it would have been
for us if you still had the ball.

16:19.592 --> 16:23.187
This is a football. I want you
to carry this with you always.

16:23.262 --> 16:27.028
Never let it out of your sight.
Hey, boys, listen!

16:28.501 --> 16:31.163
Jefferson here's gonna be carryin'
this football on campus.

16:31.237 --> 16:34.570
Anyone of you guys see him, I want
you to try to slap it out of his hand.

16:34.640 --> 16:37.700
All right, try to knock it out
and recover it.

16:37.777 --> 16:39.768
Anybody but you...

16:39.845 --> 16:43.008
return this ball to me,
you'll wish you were never born.

16:45.117 --> 16:47.210
<i>All right,
let's step it up.!</i>

16:47.286 --> 16:51.052
<i>Welcome to thejungle
we got fun and games</i>

16:51.123 --> 16:53.683
<i>We got everything you want
How do we know</i>

16:53.759 --> 16:56.853
<i>Just 'cause we are
the people that can find</i>

16:56.929 --> 16:58.521
<i>Whatever you may need</i>

16:58.597 --> 17:00.565
<i>Whenever we're together,

17:07.306 --> 17:10.570
<i>Na-na-na-na-na-na
Please, please</i>

17:10.643 --> 17:14.409
<i>Welcome to thejungle
won't you pass here every day</i>

17:14.480 --> 17:17.881
<i>Learn to live like an animal
who's noble when we play</i>

17:17.950 --> 17:20.281
<i>Got you locked up
with what you see</i>

17:20.353 --> 17:22.320
<i>Tag it and you leave</i>

17:22.387 --> 17:24.219
<i>You can have
anything you want</i>

17:24.290 --> 17:25.780
<i>But you better not
take it from me</i>

17:25.858 --> 17:28.554
<i>In thejungle
Welcome to thejungle</i>

17:28.627 --> 17:30.151
<i>Wort you come along</i>

17:30.229 --> 17:35.496
<i>Waah
I'm gonna watch you bleed</i>

17:42.675 --> 17:46.736
<i>Shit, Lattimer's an animal all
of a sudden. He's gotta be on somethin' </i>

17:46.812 --> 17:50.304
Steroids? How come you always think
my guys are the ones juicin' , anyway?

17:50.383 --> 17:53.250
<i>He's on
the punt return team for three years,;</i>

17:53.319 --> 17:55.617
<i>then he gains 35 pounds of rip
in one summer...</i>

17:55.688 --> 17:57.986
<i>- and an attitude to go with it?
- Gentlemen,</i>

17:58.057 --> 18:00.321
we're not doctors.

18:00.393 --> 18:02.588
The NCAA has a testing program
for this kind of thing.

18:02.661 --> 18:04.788
I suggest
we let them handle it.

18:04.864 --> 18:07.833
And it's not that hard
to gain 35 pounds over summer...

18:07.900 --> 18:10.000
if you hit the gym
real hard.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.336
You're Watching 123Movies.to
if you hit the gym
real hard.

18:11.336 --> 18:21.947
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:21.947 --> 18:22.000
Uuh! Uh-Uuh! Aah!
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:22.000 --> 18:25.815
Uuh! Uh-Uuh! Aah!

18:33.559 --> 18:35.493
Hey, how's your arm, man?

18:35.561 --> 18:38.052
- It's pretty good for the first day.
- Cool.

18:38.130 --> 18:40.064
- Hey, Bud?
- Uh-huh?

18:40.132 --> 18:43.898
<i>- How come you never ask me about my arm?
- You have an arm?</i>

18:43.969 --> 18:47.063
Wanna hold this for me?
I'll meet you outside.

18:47.139 --> 18:50.575
No problem.
Don't strain yourself.

19:05.224 --> 19:07.158
How ya doin' ?

19:09.995 --> 19:11.929
Fine.

19:13.466 --> 19:17.493
- It's a little late
to be workin' out, isn't it?

19:17.570 --> 19:21.700
It's the only time I could get in here
when the football team wasrt using it.

19:21.774 --> 19:25.232
Yeah, well, if it wasrt
for the football team,

19:25.311 --> 19:27.677
you wouldn't have
all this nice equipment to use.

19:30.316 --> 19:33.979
So what, are you firmin' up,
or what?

19:34.053 --> 19:38.581
I don't need to firm up. I'm strengthening
my knee. I had orthoscopic surgery.

19:38.657 --> 19:41.558
Yeah, I had my knee
scoped once too.

19:41.627 --> 19:47.122
So, uh, you wanna go out for a
beer or something after you're done?

19:47.199 --> 19:51.898
I don't go out with football players.
They're all full of themselves.

19:51.971 --> 19:56.533
<i>I saw you on the cover of Sports Illustrated,
so you're probably worst than most.</i>

19:56.609 --> 20:01.376
Huh! So you won't consider
doin' anything with me?

20:01.447 --> 20:03.312
No.

20:03.382 --> 20:07.250
All right, well, at least tell
me what happened to your knee?

20:07.319 --> 20:09.879
What'd you do, fall out
of your convertible?

20:09.955 --> 20:14.051
You know what?

20:14.126 --> 20:18.324
There is one thing that I
might consider doing with you.

20:18.397 --> 20:20.422
Oh, yeah?
What's that?

20:46.492 --> 20:48.357
Shit!

20:52.031 --> 20:54.431
Uh...

20:57.336 --> 21:00.305
Thanks for the game, Heisman.
You took it real well.

21:00.372 --> 21:04.035
I want a rematch.

21:04.109 --> 21:06.543
<i>- A rematch?
- Yeah, that's right.</i>

21:06.612 --> 21:10.378
Some other sport. I took my
beatings. You owe me one, right?

21:10.449 --> 21:13.612
<i>Either that
or you go out with me.</i>

21:18.190 --> 21:23.355
I'll think about it.
Give me a call.

21:29.902 --> 21:32.234
- How'd I do?
- That was a real good date, Joe.

21:32.304 --> 21:35.865
Remind me to take her out sometime!
Ha-ha!

21:38.677 --> 21:42.340
Damn! Fuck.

21:42.414 --> 21:45.349
Yo, my man. Can you tell me
where Gaines Hall is at?

21:45.417 --> 21:49.183
- It's at the end of Douglas Quad.
- Thanks a lot, yo.

21:50.222 --> 21:52.656
Where the hell
is Douglas Quad?

21:56.662 --> 22:00.621
Darnell, I've reviewed
your placement test...

22:00.699 --> 22:04.226
and I'm afraid you've failed
to meet our requirements...

22:04.303 --> 22:08.433
in several areas.

22:08.507 --> 22:10.441
Does this mean
I can't play ball?

22:10.509 --> 22:14.707
No, it means you're going to have
to take some remedial courses.

22:14.780 --> 22:19.080
Specifically,
Math 0, English 0,

22:19.151 --> 22:22.552
<i>plus an American history
survey course.</i>

22:22.621 --> 22:26.682
<i>You won't get college credit for them,
but they will help you prepare to take...</i>

22:26.759 --> 22:29.353
the placement test again
at the end of the quarter.

22:29.428 --> 22:34.764
If you pass at that time, you'll be able
to take regular college-level courses.

22:34.833 --> 22:39.532
But first things first. To start,
I'm approving a tutor for you.

22:39.605 --> 22:41.539
Tutor?
I don't need no tutor.

22:41.607 --> 22:45.441
<i>Any tutor.
And yes, you do.</i>

22:50.182 --> 22:51.877
What's up, Autumn?

22:51.950 --> 22:55.818
Hey, Darnell.
What are you doin' here?

22:55.888 --> 22:57.822
<i>Hey, nothin'
I'm just kickin' it.</i>

22:57.890 --> 23:02.554
I was talkin' to my advisor
and he seems to think I need a tutor.

23:02.628 --> 23:04.892
<i>Just to get me over
a couple of rough spots, that's all.</i>

23:04.963 --> 23:08.057
I was lookin' on this list
right here and I saw your name.

23:08.133 --> 23:11.068
I figured if you can't keep
my attention, nobody can.

23:11.136 --> 23:13.570
I'm sorry, Darnell,

23:13.639 --> 23:17.575
but you're going to have to get yourself
another tutor because I've already been assigned.

23:17.643 --> 23:21.602
<i>- I'm tutoring Scott Sherman.
- Not anymore. I asked Coach Winters to switch us.</i>

23:21.680 --> 23:25.411
<i>- Coach Winters wouldn't do that.
- Yes, he would.!</i>

23:25.484 --> 23:27.952
Yo, I'm a much bigger prospect
that Scott Sherman.

23:28.020 --> 23:30.511
<i>Would you look at him?
Look.!</i>

23:30.589 --> 23:33.456
He ain't nothin' but a big, fat, pork
rind-eatin' lineman on the scout team.

23:33.525 --> 23:37.621
Come on, now, girl. You could teach me some
real erudition. You know what I'm sayin' ?

23:37.696 --> 23:41.962
Will you stop using those big words?
It makes you sound ridiculous.

23:42.034 --> 23:44.366
What are you talkin' about?
I'm improvin' myself.

23:44.436 --> 23:47.234
Every day I learn a new word
out of the dictionary.

23:47.306 --> 23:50.639
Mendacious, pejorative,
antithetical, commensurate...

23:50.709 --> 23:52.643
And you don't even know
how to use 'em right!

23:52.711 --> 23:55.612
Pretending to be smart is not
the same thing as being educated.

23:55.681 --> 23:58.275
It's just a con
that makes you sound stupid,

23:58.350 --> 24:01.046
no matter how big
a prospect you are.

24:04.056 --> 24:09.153
Okay. But that's even more of a reason
for you to be my tutor.

24:09.228 --> 24:12.061
You just
taught me somethin' .

24:15.434 --> 24:17.834
<i>Oh, Mr. Heisman?</i>

24:17.903 --> 24:21.771
<i>- Joe? We got a present for you.
- Oh, no.</i>

24:21.840 --> 24:24.001
Carryin' you, as usual.

24:24.076 --> 24:27.705
<i>Kinda looks like you,
but not as skinny.</i>

24:27.780 --> 24:29.839
Joey, you're our hero.

25:16.595 --> 25:18.859
Uhh.

25:18.931 --> 25:22.799
- Hello?
- Hi, it's Joe Kane.

25:22.868 --> 25:26.804
It's 3:00 in the morning.

25:26.872 --> 25:29.306
I wanna know
what you decided.

25:29.374 --> 25:32.172
I don't know.

25:32.244 --> 25:35.611
I couldn't think of any other sports
I could beat you at.

25:35.681 --> 25:38.980
Then I'll pick you up
tonight at 6:00.

25:40.219 --> 25:42.210
Wha...?

25:48.727 --> 25:52.595
- We're goin' on that?
- Yeah, I thought we might take a little ride.

25:52.664 --> 25:55.895
I promised my Dad
I'd never get on one of those.

25:55.968 --> 25:58.835
<i>What are ya, one of those
trust-fund princesses?</i>

25:58.904 --> 26:01.498
It's okay for me
to play a game I don't know,

26:01.573 --> 26:04.736
but I ask you to try somethin' different
and you hide behind your daddy?

26:12.951 --> 26:17.615
Okay. We go slow.
No cowboy stuff.

26:43.682 --> 26:46.674
- Am I goin' too fast for ya?
- What?

26:46.752 --> 26:49.084
Am I goin'
too fast for ya?

26:49.154 --> 26:54.148
- Oh, no, this is fine.
- Good. Let's get it!

26:54.226 --> 26:56.490
Stop!

26:56.561 --> 27:00.793
- Slow down! Goddammit, slow down!
- Yeah!

27:03.669 --> 27:06.900
Where are we going?

27:06.972 --> 27:09.497
This isn't even
a real road.

27:09.574 --> 27:12.509
Joe, are you
listening to me?

27:19.918 --> 27:21.681
Joe, slow down!

27:22.888 --> 27:24.822
Joe, look out!

27:25.991 --> 27:30.394
Jo-o-o-o-oe!

27:30.462 --> 27:32.396
Uuh!

27:35.167 --> 27:38.603
Goddammit! You crazy?
How could you do that?

27:38.670 --> 27:41.696
- You could've killed us!
- Woo!

27:43.408 --> 27:45.342
<i>Uh, that could've been ugly.</i>

27:45.410 --> 27:48.846
- Goddamn!
- I've done that 100 times before.

27:48.914 --> 27:52.873
- Never with anybody on the back,
but it was fun, wasrt it?

27:55.253 --> 27:57.687
You just wanted to scare me.
Are you happy now?

27:57.756 --> 28:01.283
Yeah. Actually, the scream
was even better than I thought.

28:01.360 --> 28:04.352
You got just about every dog in hearing
distance wantin' to mate with you.

28:10.969 --> 28:13.233
Do you come here a lot?

28:13.305 --> 28:16.274
Now and then.
Why?

28:16.341 --> 28:19.401
Well, it's not exactly
a campus favorite.

28:19.478 --> 28:22.879
This is more like
hidin' out.

28:22.948 --> 28:24.882
<i>Nice shot.!</i>

28:24.950 --> 28:28.283
I like to go places
where nobody knows me.

28:28.353 --> 28:30.844
Why, is this
too low-rent for you?

28:30.922 --> 28:33.117
No, no.

28:33.191 --> 28:36.058
- My father owned a place like this.
- Your father?

28:36.128 --> 28:40.064
- Mm-hmm. - What, you mean
he owned a chain of these?

28:40.132 --> 28:45.399
No. You know, not everybody who plays
tennis grew up in a country club, Joe.

28:47.372 --> 28:50.773
My dad could never afford
to send me here.

28:50.842 --> 28:55.506
When I hurt my knee I was afraid
I was gonna lose my scholarship.

28:55.580 --> 28:58.014
So, you're a full-ticket jock,
just like me?

28:58.083 --> 29:00.278
Yeah.
Are you disappointed?

29:02.487 --> 29:05.115
No, I just never went out
with a jock before.

29:05.190 --> 29:09.524
Huh! Is that what's goin' on here?
We're goin' out?

29:09.594 --> 29:13.496
What do you think?
Come on.

29:17.669 --> 29:21.036
I think you're, ah, crazy for
jeopardizing your scholarship...

29:21.106 --> 29:24.269
and a pro career by jumping
motorcycles off of highways.

29:26.078 --> 29:28.444
Just tryin'
to keep my edge.

29:28.513 --> 29:32.415
<i>- If you don't know me by now
- Hmm!</i>

29:32.484 --> 29:35.317
See, the guys, they...

29:35.387 --> 29:38.823
They look to me 'cause they think
I'll do anything.

29:41.193 --> 29:44.162
If I lose that,
then I'm just another guy.

29:44.229 --> 29:46.527
Then we'd get
the shit kicked out of us.

29:46.598 --> 29:48.498
<i>If you don't know me by now</i>

29:48.567 --> 29:54.631
<i>If you don't know me, baby
you will never, never never know me</i>

29:54.706 --> 29:57.504
<i>- No, you won't
- You scare me, Joe.</i>

29:57.576 --> 30:05.176
<i>Ah-hey
If you don't know me by now</i>

30:05.250 --> 30:11.018
<i>You will never, never
never know me</i>

30:20.465 --> 30:22.399
The keys.

30:25.070 --> 30:27.766
Look, I told you. During the season,
no unnecessary risks.

30:27.839 --> 30:31.570
<i>Any guy that's up for the Heisman
should be able to remember that, no?</i>

30:35.580 --> 30:38.014
Thanks. Good night.

30:43.722 --> 30:46.316
Now, using the things we worked on
yesterday, I want you to write...

30:46.391 --> 30:49.952
a two or three page essay about
some aspect of your life...

30:50.028 --> 30:52.963
other than football.

30:53.031 --> 30:56.091
What's in my life
besides football?

30:56.168 --> 30:58.295
I don't know.
Your father.

30:58.370 --> 31:01.305
You could write
about your dad.

31:04.209 --> 31:08.373
I don't know
much about him.

31:08.446 --> 31:12.143
He was off in Detroit workin'
in a car plant when I was born.

31:14.686 --> 31:17.382
Got laid off.

31:17.455 --> 31:21.983
Tried to rob a liquor store
to get us some money.

31:22.060 --> 31:23.994
Got caught.

31:26.364 --> 31:29.595
Died in prison.
Some kind of heart problem.

31:29.668 --> 31:35.004
Well, maybe you can write
about your mother.

31:37.309 --> 31:41.575
She was usually
workin' two jobs.

31:41.646 --> 31:46.640
One night she stopped at a grocery
store to get me some root beer.

31:46.718 --> 31:50.916
She got caught
in gang cross fire.

31:50.989 --> 31:52.923
Shot three times.

31:52.991 --> 31:57.018
Died on the way
to the hospital.

31:57.095 --> 31:59.154
Want me to write
about that?

31:59.231 --> 32:01.165
No.

32:01.233 --> 32:03.929
That's good,
'cause ain't none of that true.

32:04.002 --> 32:07.802
Gee whiz, Darnell!

32:07.872 --> 32:12.138
What kind of a thing is that
to do to somebody? It's not funny.

32:12.210 --> 32:14.974
I had you goin' ,
didn't I?

32:15.046 --> 32:19.346
No, you did not have me goin' ! Why
would you make up something like that?

32:19.417 --> 32:21.885
Sounded more interesting
than the truth.

32:21.953 --> 32:24.387
<i>I never knew
who my dad was.</i>

32:24.456 --> 32:30.019
When I was 12, my mother took a
vacation in Chicago and never came back.

32:33.331 --> 32:38.496
Well, then, maybe just this once,
you can write about football.

32:41.506 --> 32:44.441
I've seen a lot of
shitty things in life, Autumn.

32:44.509 --> 32:46.977
That's why I know
when I see something good.

32:49.714 --> 32:53.150
Okay, let's review the chapter
I read you yesterday.

32:53.218 --> 32:56.847
Which two city-states
fought in the Punic Wars?

32:56.921 --> 33:00.948
I don't know.
Detroit and Buffalo?

33:01.026 --> 33:05.622
- Oh, come on, Alvin.
You're gonna be tested on this.

33:05.697 --> 33:08.757
<i>Rookies, you pay attention. This is what
I expect out of you. Alvin, you ready?</i>

33:08.833 --> 33:11.165
- Yes, sir.
- All right, this is Mississippi State's offensive set.

33:11.236 --> 33:14.262
Second and two on our own 24.
What defensive set might we call?

33:14.339 --> 33:16.830
Eagle, zipper, hero,
unless the setback shifts into the I.

33:16.908 --> 33:20.071
<i>Good.
Third and seven.</i>

33:20.145 --> 33:22.409
- Oakie, thunder, lion.
- What's your assignment?

33:22.480 --> 33:24.675
Kill the quarterback.

33:24.749 --> 33:28.378
<i>Hit the tight end so hard
his girlfriend dies.</i>

33:28.453 --> 33:31.752
<i>- Kill everybody.
- There you go.</i>

33:31.823 --> 33:34.257
Ready?

33:39.864 --> 33:43.231
Uuh!

33:43.301 --> 33:47.465
<i>Very nice game.</i>

33:49.040 --> 33:54.103
<i>Well, you owe me a dinner.
But you're takin' it real well.</i>

33:54.179 --> 33:56.477
Now, George Washington
won a few skirmishes,

33:56.548 --> 33:59.039
<i>but he never actually
won a real battle.</i>

33:59.117 --> 34:01.051
<i>- Still, he won the war...
- Shit!</i>

34:01.119 --> 34:03.110
<i>Fumble.! Fumble.! Fumble.!</i>

34:03.188 --> 34:05.452
<i>What the hell's goin' on?
- It's mine!</i>

34:05.523 --> 34:08.219
- I got it, man!
- I got it, I got it!

34:08.293 --> 34:10.887
<i>Return to your seats, gentlemen,
this is unacceptable behavior.!</i>

34:10.962 --> 34:13.829
<i>Gentlemen...</i>

34:17.235 --> 34:20.398
- Gimme the ball!
- Got it, punk! Get yo' butt outta my face!

34:23.507 --> 34:28.309
<i>You lucky, chump.
Catch you slippin' </i>

34:28.380 --> 34:30.348
Sorry.
I lost my ball.

34:41.359 --> 34:43.293
<i>You in there, buddy.</i>

34:43.360 --> 34:46.762
Yes! Yeah!
Starting defense!

34:46.831 --> 34:49.322
Place at the table!
Woo-oo-oo!

34:49.400 --> 34:51.266
Woo-oo, yeah!

34:51.335 --> 34:54.668
<i>Looks likeJoe's comin' around.
He should be ready for Saturday.</i>

34:56.741 --> 34:59.904
Place at the table!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

34:59.978 --> 35:02.003
<i>Yeah! Woo!</i>

35:02.080 --> 35:04.310
Jesus! You think
we oughta tell coach?

35:04.382 --> 35:06.316
Hell no, he don't
wanna know about this.

35:06.384 --> 35:09.478
<i>Woo! Yeah!</i>

35:09.554 --> 35:14.116
Make sure you tell Lattimer that
the NCAA will be testing on Saturday.

35:14.192 --> 35:18.561
Yeah, baby!
Starting defense! Woo!

35:18.630 --> 35:22.691
<i>As my upperclassmen know, we have Pride
Night every year before our opening game.</i>

35:22.767 --> 35:27.500
So I'd like each of you to talk about
what you like best about football,

35:27.572 --> 35:30.302
and what you're most proud of
off the field.

35:30.375 --> 35:33.503
Now, I've asked some
of my veterans here to start.

35:33.578 --> 35:35.512
<i>Lattimer?</i>

35:35.580 --> 35:38.105
I don't know.

35:38.183 --> 35:41.175
It's the battle.

35:41.252 --> 35:43.482
The goin' to war
with the other guys.

35:43.555 --> 35:45.921
<i>- Set.!
- Hangin' together.</i>

35:45.990 --> 35:49.187
<i>- Blue 80.! Hut.!
- Havin' our own dorm.</i>

35:49.260 --> 35:52.058
<i>Stayin' in hotels
the night before the games.</i>

35:52.130 --> 35:55.065
<i>Settin' ourselves apart.</i>

35:57.368 --> 35:59.928
<i>Bein' different
than everybody else.</i>

36:00.004 --> 36:02.404
<i>Havin' a chance
to be somebody.</i>

36:04.609 --> 36:09.740
<i>To do somethin' that people
look up to you for.</i>

36:09.814 --> 36:13.773
<i>Your strength.
Your courage.</i>

36:15.520 --> 36:18.353
<i>Not everybody
can play football.</i>

36:18.423 --> 36:22.018
We're the lucky ones.

36:22.093 --> 36:24.755
<i>The thing
that I'm most proud of myself for...</i>

36:24.829 --> 36:28.196
Just that I'm here...

36:28.266 --> 36:33.602
<i>and not in jail
or dead.</i>

36:33.671 --> 36:36.936
I ain't no statistic.

36:37.008 --> 36:40.409
Well, the great thing
about football is, uh,

36:40.478 --> 36:43.743
<i>that you can lose yourself
in it.</i>

36:43.815 --> 36:46.249
<i>There's no time to think
or to worry.</i>

36:46.317 --> 36:51.380
<i>You just, ah,
you just move and react.</i>

36:51.456 --> 36:54.254
Hell, everything else
fades away.

36:54.325 --> 36:57.089
<i>Best thing
is when you get a guy.</i>

36:57.161 --> 37:00.221
Know it's... killin' him.

37:00.298 --> 37:02.664
But you feel great.

37:02.734 --> 37:05.396
It's just him and you...

37:05.470 --> 37:07.631
<i>and he's the one
that's hurtin' </i>

37:10.000 --> 37:15.213
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:15.213 --> 37:17.147
<i>- Yeah!
- Game's on.!</i>
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:17.147 --> 37:22.000
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:37.535 --> 37:39.969
Don't be late!

37:45.777 --> 37:49.975
- Hey! This big enough for you, baby?
- Hell, yeah, I'm with it!

37:57.355 --> 37:59.380
<i>Welcome, everybody,
to the Wolf Den...</i>

37:59.457 --> 38:04.986
where the ESU Timberwolves, led by Heisman
Trophy candidate Joe Kane, open their season...

38:05.063 --> 38:08.362
<i>against
the Mississippi State Bulldogs.</i>

38:10.435 --> 38:15.031
<i>The Bulldogs have won the toss,
so the T-wolves will be kicking off.</i>

38:16.274 --> 38:18.970
<i>And we are underway.</i>

38:19.043 --> 38:22.672
<i>Kick coming down to
Tyler in the end zone.</i>

38:22.747 --> 38:26.080
<i>He's gonna bring it up.</i>

38:26.150 --> 38:29.483
<i>Back to the 15...
to the 20.</i>

38:31.255 --> 38:34.816
<i>- Brought down at the 22-yard line
by Powell and Ellswon'th.</i>

38:34.892 --> 38:37.656
<i>- Now we'll see
how the ESU defense,</i>

38:37.729 --> 38:39.993
<i>Led by All-American linebacker
Alvin Mack does...</i>

38:40.064 --> 38:43.124
<i>- in its first test of the season.
- Yeah! All right!</i>

38:43.201 --> 38:46.534
- Hit squad is in the house!
- Yeah, it's party time, baby!

38:46.604 --> 38:49.573
- All right now, baby, all right. Sixty minutes, balls out.
- Yeah!

38:49.641 --> 38:52.769
Let's open up the whole can of kick ass
and kill 'em all.

38:52.844 --> 38:54.778
- Let the paramedics sort
'em out. - Yeah. - Right.

38:54.846 --> 38:57.713
- Razor, bear claw, stinger. Ready...
- Break!

38:57.782 --> 39:02.116
<i>Bulldogs coming to the line of scrimmage,
T- wolves in their standard 4-3.</i>

39:02.186 --> 39:06.850
Hey, 23! Don't think I don't recognize
you, you poo-butt motherfucker!

39:06.924 --> 39:09.688
Hey, pay attention
when I'm talkin' to you, nigger!

39:09.761 --> 39:13.219
<i>- What?
- You're the guy who shot my mother, aren't you?</i>

39:13.297 --> 39:15.561
Shut up, man.
You know I never knew your mother.

39:15.633 --> 39:19.364
- Hut!
- You were tryin' to steal her fuckin' car, you cocksucker!

39:19.437 --> 39:21.632
You didn't think
I was gonna find ya, did ya?

39:21.706 --> 39:25.472
<i>But I got you now, nigger. I'm gonna
bust your gut open and watch you die.!</i>

39:25.543 --> 39:29.035
Hut!

39:29.113 --> 39:33.573
<i>- Lock pitches to Tyler, sweeping left.
- Say your prayers!</i>

39:33.651 --> 39:35.312
<i>- Mack cuts 'im off.
- Aw, shit!</i>

39:35.386 --> 39:39.083
<i>Come back here,
you little pussy.! Uuuh.!</i>

39:39.157 --> 39:42.149
<i>- Oh.!
Tyler crunched by Lattimer.</i>

39:42.226 --> 39:44.456
<i>- Fumble.!
- No! It's mine! It's mine!</i>

39:44.529 --> 39:48.397
<i>It's our ball, it's our ball, it's
our ball, it's our ball, it's our ball.</i>

39:48.466 --> 39:51.867
<i>They unstack 'em and...
ESU has got it.!</i>

39:51.936 --> 39:54.632
- Hell yeah! Hell yeah!
- All right!

39:54.706 --> 39:56.640
Beautiful thing, baby!

39:59.343 --> 40:03.006
Gettin' your nose in there!
Atta baby, B.A.!

40:03.081 --> 40:05.379
Good pop, Lats.
Stay it, buddy.

40:05.450 --> 40:07.384
Joe, Joe, come here.
Joe!

40:07.452 --> 40:10.683
Let's go up top. Take the team
right away. Z-3 motion, let's go!

40:10.755 --> 40:12.689
<i>So we'll see
what Kane does here...</i>

40:12.757 --> 40:15.317
<i>as the Wolves attempt
to capitalize on the turnover.</i>

40:15.393 --> 40:19.261
<i>- Come on let's go. Let's do it, now.
- Let's take it to 'em now.</i>

40:19.330 --> 40:21.457
Trips right, motion Z-3.

40:21.532 --> 40:23.762
Let's put the women and children to bed
and go lookin' for dinner, boys.

40:23.835 --> 40:25.769
- On four. Ready?
- Break!

40:25.837 --> 40:29.796
Yippee ki-yi-yo
Git along little dogies

40:29.874 --> 40:32.638
It's your misfortune
and none of my own

40:32.710 --> 40:35.941
<i>Shut up, snowflake!
You think you're on Star Search?</i>

40:36.013 --> 40:39.779
Nope. We're roundin' dogies into the end
zone and the trail runs right over your ass.

40:39.851 --> 40:44.447
Bullshit! You gonna be my bitch!
You gonna be my punk bitch, baby!

40:47.959 --> 40:49.984
<i>Kane fades back to pass.</i>

40:51.929 --> 40:56.491
Ha-ha! You'll never be
half the man your mama was! Aaah!

40:59.036 --> 41:03.530
It's your misfortune now,
fat boy! Take this! Eat it!

41:03.608 --> 41:08.307
<i>Looking down field...
Ward has a step on his man.!</i>

41:08.379 --> 41:11.439
<i>Kane going for it all.</i>

41:11.516 --> 41:13.507
<i>Fires for Flea Ward
in the end zone...</i>

41:13.584 --> 41:16.018
<i>Great catch.!
Touchdown, ESU.</i>

41:16.087 --> 41:18.851
- Yes! Yes!
- Hold on!

41:21.793 --> 41:25.024
Get off me!
Stop it! Get off!

41:25.096 --> 41:28.964
<i>- Play is over.!
- 'Scuze me. My dogies just reached the end zone...</i>

41:29.033 --> 41:31.160
<i>- and I gotta do some celebratin' .
- Fuck you.!</i>

41:31.235 --> 41:35.638
- Yeah! That's it, Flea!
- It's on the money, right there!

41:35.706 --> 41:40.040
Hell of a pass, man.
Wish I'd seen it.

41:40.111 --> 41:44.207
<i>2.;05 left in the game.
Wolves up, 28-20.</i>

41:44.282 --> 41:47.115

DarnellJefferson making his first
appearance at tailback.

41:53.224 --> 41:55.522
Kane brings him up

Hike!

42:00.298 --> 42:04.564
<i>Pass toJefferson up the middle.
Out to the 35-, 36-yard line.</i>

42:04.635 --> 42:08.537
<i>Nice game for the freshman who had a
little bit of fumble-itis in fall practice.</i>

42:08.606 --> 42:10.039
Hey, hey...

42:10.107 --> 42:12.132
<i>Hey.!</i>

42:12.210 --> 42:15.702
'Scuze me, son, but we're gonna be needin'
that football for another couple of minutes.

42:15.780 --> 42:17.941
Right, right.

42:18.015 --> 42:19.949
<i>Huddle up.!</i>

42:20.017 --> 42:23.214
<i>Eight seconds left.
Last chance for Mississippi State.</i>

42:23.287 --> 42:25.619
Hike!

42:27.225 --> 42:31.059
<i>Lock fades back to pass.
- U-u-u-uh!</i>

42:31.128 --> 42:33.562
<i>Lattimer coming
from the left side... Oh.!</i>

42:33.631 --> 42:36.566
<i>- He almost takes Lock's head off.
- Looks like you lost your bonnet, baby!</i>

42:36.634 --> 42:40.070
Yeah! Yeah!
Woo!

42:40.137 --> 42:44.597
Yeah! Aha-ha!
Woo!

42:44.675 --> 42:46.734
<i>And that'll do it.
The game is over...</i>

42:46.811 --> 42:51.009
<i>as the '93 season gets off to a
good start for the Timberwolves...</i>

42:51.082 --> 42:53.915
with a 28 to 20 win over
the Mississippi State Bulldogs.

42:53.985 --> 42:57.751
- Get to keep the car,
got the house for another week!

42:59.323 --> 43:01.814
One at a time. Go ahead, Rhoda.

43:01.893 --> 43:05.852
This performance today, two
touchdown passes, another you ran in.

43:05.930 --> 43:08.626
Where do you think this puts you
in the Heisman race?

43:08.699 --> 43:11.691
Well, I really don't know about
that. That's up to you guys.

43:11.769 --> 43:13.703
<i>This way.!</i>

43:13.771 --> 43:17.502
And now, let's turn
to our Heisman watch.

43:17.575 --> 43:20.738
<i>We begin with Sports Illustrated
cover boyJoe Kane of ESU,</i>

43:20.811 --> 43:23.905
who led his team to an impressive
victory this afternoon.

43:23.981 --> 43:25.915
<i>Though the real test will come
in four weeks...</i>

43:25.983 --> 43:29.146
<i>against Michigan and their
Heisman hopeful, Tim Waymen,;</i>

43:29.220 --> 43:32.383
Tim "he could go
all the" Waymen.

43:32.456 --> 43:34.447
He'll be lookin' to do so
against the Timberwolves.

43:34.525 --> 43:38.154
And of course, the "able"
Kane will be looking to do so as well.

43:49.907 --> 43:52.671
Hey, Darnell. Did a really
great job out there today.

43:52.743 --> 43:54.938
- Way to hold onto that pigskin.
- Thank you.

43:55.012 --> 43:58.072
Little something for ya.

43:58.149 --> 44:00.583
Keep up the good work.

44:13.731 --> 44:17.394
- Played a hell of a game, son. Proud of you.
- Thank you.

44:17.468 --> 44:21.234
- Let me talk to you for a second.
- Thanks again.

44:21.305 --> 44:24.866
- Yo, some guy just gave me $50, man.
- Don't worry.

44:24.942 --> 44:29.606
You'll get about $500 or $600 once
you start, dependin' on how you play.

44:29.680 --> 44:32.274
But I thought we werert supposed to
take any money. Ain't that a violation?

44:32.350 --> 44:36.582
You cannot live on no $500
a month scholarship money.

44:36.654 --> 44:39.748
<i>The NC-double assholes
won't let us havejobs,</i>

44:39.824 --> 44:42.418
so you take your money
where you can get it.

44:42.493 --> 44:47.021
As a matter of fact, let me hold
this for you 'til you see the light.

44:47.098 --> 44:50.124
<i>Shit, oughta be
payin' us anyway.</i>

44:50.201 --> 44:54.797
Athletic department gets $3 million
just for goin' to a bowl game.

45:03.647 --> 45:07.674
<i>Pretty little funky thang
nothin' like I ever I seen</i>

45:07.752 --> 45:10.186
<i>Woo.!</i>

45:12.390 --> 45:16.554
<i>Pretty little funky thang
bouncy little play by play</i>

45:21.165 --> 45:25.295
<i>Pretty little funky thang
nothin' like I ever I seen</i>

45:25.369 --> 45:28.031
Hey.

45:28.105 --> 45:31.336
Forget it, nigger.
No chance for you there.

45:31.409 --> 45:33.434
How do you figure?

45:33.511 --> 45:35.877
Griffers goin'
to medical school.

45:35.946 --> 45:40.349
She likes that light-skinned
respectable shit.

45:40.418 --> 45:44.081
You? You just
a ghetto toy.

45:50.761 --> 45:54.162
- Can I have this one?
- Hey, I don't think so.

45:54.231 --> 45:57.894
What you worried about, boy? You
haven't lost your startin' job just yet.

45:57.968 --> 46:01.529
- Hey, you got a problem, buddy?
- Ray, just one, okay?

46:01.605 --> 46:05.564
All right, just one.

46:05.643 --> 46:09.977
Take it easy, Darnell. You are putting
me in a very awkward situation here.

46:10.047 --> 46:12.208
<i>I had a little encouragement
along the way.</i>

46:12.283 --> 46:14.877
Listen, I want
to see you, Autumn.

46:14.952 --> 46:18.945
Not in a study hall;
not like your student.

46:19.023 --> 46:23.426
- I want to be taken seriously.
- Darnell, I do take you seriously.

46:23.494 --> 46:25.724
But if you haven't noticed,
I'm still with Ray...

46:25.796 --> 46:28.390
and I cannot just go paradin' around
town with you.

46:28.466 --> 46:31.902
We don't have to go paradin' .
We can go someplace different;

46:31.969 --> 46:34.904
someplace that nobody'll see us.

46:38.242 --> 46:41.700
Why am I even considering this?
It's crazy.

46:41.779 --> 46:45.613
Hey, genius. You all caught up
on your arithmetic?

46:45.683 --> 46:50.916
Yeah, yeah. You only gained,
uh, 37 yards on 12 carries.

46:50.988 --> 46:53.923
- Hey, hey! Come on!
- You want some of this? Come on!

46:53.991 --> 46:56.221
- Hey!
- Easy.

46:56.293 --> 46:59.694
- Come on!
- Cool.

47:00.931 --> 47:03.399
Just calm it,
buddy, Darnell.

47:03.467 --> 47:05.935
<i>So much for
team unity, huh?</i>

47:06.003 --> 47:08.665
- Yeah.
- You didn't have anything to do with that, did ya?

47:08.739 --> 47:11.503
- Hell no! You know me.
- Chshh! Right!

47:11.575 --> 47:13.543
Come here.
We need to talk.

47:13.611 --> 47:15.909
Look, I'm gettin' a little
sick of that asshole, Autumn.

47:15.980 --> 47:17.914
I don't like you hangin' out
with him. It's embarrassing.

47:17.982 --> 47:20.746
- I don't hang out with him. I tutor him.
- Then have him get another tutor.

47:20.818 --> 47:23.116
I can't do that.
I promised him I'd help him pass...

47:23.187 --> 47:26.213
his qualifying exam, and I
can't go bailin' out on him now.

47:26.290 --> 47:29.123
What the hell difference does it make? They'll
grease him through no matter what he does.

47:29.193 --> 47:31.218
Nobody's ever gonna see
that boy graduate.

47:31.295 --> 47:33.855
Hey, don't tell me
you've fallen for this guy.

47:33.931 --> 47:36.263
He's nothin' .
He's just another gangbanger with speed.

47:36.333 --> 47:40.201
I'm tryin' to help him out.
What're you more afraid of, Ray?

47:40.271 --> 47:43.638
Losin' your girl
or your position?

47:43.707 --> 47:47.939
Maybe you better think a little bit more
about what you're in danger of losing.

47:48.012 --> 47:51.539
Well, maybe I will.

48:00.491 --> 48:03.426
<i>So, where you
wanna go?</i>

48:06.363 --> 48:08.627
<i>Whatcha find?</i>

48:08.699 --> 48:11.133
<i>Now, you gotta make it all the
way around at least once, girl.</i>

48:11.202 --> 48:15.468
You're right, Darnell. I don't
think anybody would find us here. Ha!

48:15.539 --> 48:19.339
Hey, I figure the key is to
go places only white people go.

48:19.410 --> 48:22.743
I think next time we'll go bowling.

48:22.813 --> 48:25.077
<i>Plus, I saw this on
Rocky, you know.</i>

48:25.149 --> 48:27.811
I always used to wonder
how a guy...

48:27.885 --> 48:31.685
who's supposed to be such a
great athlete was skatin' so bad.

48:33.757 --> 48:36.191
Nice form, Jefferson.

48:38.262 --> 48:40.389
You all right?

48:40.464 --> 48:44.992
Thank you, Darnell. This is fun.
Well, sort of fun.

48:45.069 --> 48:47.003
Nah, you were good
for your first time.

48:47.071 --> 48:50.563
Well, actually,
this isn't my first time.

48:50.641 --> 48:53.474
My dad took me skating once
when I was little.

48:53.544 --> 48:58.413
- Hey, your pops used to play ball for ESU, didn't he?
- Yeah. How'd you know?

48:58.482 --> 49:01.280
I saw his picture
on the Wall of Fame.

49:01.352 --> 49:04.719
You know, you got his eyes.
Luckily, you didn't get his thighs.

49:04.788 --> 49:07.222
I know!

49:11.595 --> 49:14.189
Make sure you mean it,
all right?

49:16.433 --> 49:18.367
Yeah.

49:35.753 --> 49:38.688
Excuse me.
What's your name?

49:38.756 --> 49:40.621
Bobby Collins.

49:42.192 --> 49:44.387
Could I see
your I.D. Please?

49:46.096 --> 49:48.724
<i>You took someone
else's test? Damn it, Louanne.!</i>

49:48.799 --> 49:52.826
I mean, how could you be
so stupid, stupid!

49:52.903 --> 49:56.771
- He was behind, he needed help. I'm sorry, I just...
- Sorry?

49:56.840 --> 50:00.241
I mean, you weaken my authority
with the players.

50:00.311 --> 50:02.871
It looks like I'm runnin' a dirty pro...
And Bobby Collins!

50:02.946 --> 50:06.143
Of all people,
Bobby Collins! Why?

50:06.216 --> 50:08.446
I don't know.

50:08.519 --> 50:10.783
I thought
that he loved me.

50:10.854 --> 50:14.847
Loved you? Loved you? This guy
loves anything that wears a skirt!

50:14.925 --> 50:19.953
<i>This little rat bastard.!
Now you're both expelled.</i>

50:20.030 --> 50:22.089
If I tried to use my influence
to get you back in,

50:22.166 --> 50:24.327
it just destroys my credibility
with the university.

50:24.401 --> 50:27.734
- I just can't!
- I don't want you to. I'll get in someplace.

50:32.009 --> 50:33.943
Come in, Collins.

50:35.846 --> 50:37.211
Come in.

50:37.281 --> 50:39.215
Coach.

50:41.719 --> 50:46.486
Listen, I just want you to know that I'm real
sorry about this whole thing with Louanne.

50:46.557 --> 50:48.991
I was real glad to hear she's gonna
be goin' to junior college here...

50:49.059 --> 50:51.050
<i>Shut up.</i>

50:52.496 --> 50:55.897
I could, uh, pull some strings
to help you out here.

50:55.966 --> 50:57.900
But I won't.

50:57.968 --> 51:02.803
<i>You've embarrassed the school,;
you've embarrassed me,;</i>

51:02.873 --> 51:06.969
and you embarrassed
my family.

51:07.044 --> 51:11.344
So, as of now, you are no longer a member
of this university or its football team.

51:11.415 --> 51:16.352
<i>Now, go clean out
your locker.</i>

51:16.420 --> 51:19.287
You get outta here before I knock
the piss outta you!

51:31.568 --> 51:34.901
Have you seen this?
You got a "D" on your math test.

51:36.707 --> 51:40.108
I kinda figured that.
I had some trouble on the last part.

51:40.177 --> 51:43.010
Darnell, we went over this
entire chapter last week.

51:43.080 --> 51:47.176
<i>Look, I thought you wanted to learn. But if
all you wanna do is fake your way through,</i>

51:47.251 --> 51:50.778
then you're gonna have to find yourself
another tutor and waste her time.

51:50.854 --> 51:55.120
Autumn, we just had a good time. Why
you gettin' all riled up about one test?

51:55.192 --> 51:57.854
<i>- So far it's the only test!
- Shh.!</i>

52:02.766 --> 52:07.169
Look, I don't wish to be cast
in a pejorative light.

52:07.237 --> 52:09.728
Therefore, I am
dedicating myself...

52:09.807 --> 52:13.834
to achieving on a level
more commensurate with my abilities.

52:13.911 --> 52:16.846
Hmm! You're amazing.

52:28.725 --> 52:32.855
<i>Joe, relax. Look right at me.
Pay no attention to the camera, okay?</i>

52:32.930 --> 52:35.091
<i>- Okay.
- You ready?</i>

52:35.165 --> 52:37.099
All right,
here we go.

52:37.167 --> 52:40.603
Joe, this game is being billed
as a potential Heisman shoot-out.

52:40.671 --> 52:43.367
Did you feel any additional
pressure this week, knowing...

52:43.440 --> 52:47.103
<i>- that you'd be going head to head with Heisman rival, Tim Waymen?
- Set! Hike!</i>

52:48.612 --> 52:51.240
<i>Oh, I'd be lyin'
if I said I didn't, um...</i>

52:51.315 --> 52:54.807
The, uh...

52:54.885 --> 52:57.513
I mean, you try to block it out
but it's basically impossible.

52:57.588 --> 52:59.522
Everybody seems to be
talkin' about it.

52:59.590 --> 53:04.584
<i>The radios, the newspapers
and all the interviews, you know?</i>

53:04.661 --> 53:07.255
Then there's the TV, always tryin'
to get some sort of hype goin' .

53:07.331 --> 53:10.232
- Hold it, hold it!
- Sharon, what're you doing?

53:12.436 --> 53:16.634
What you're saying is true, but I don't
think it's the message you want to send.

53:16.707 --> 53:20.643
<i>It makes you seem a little nervous, like
the pressure might be getting to you.</i>

53:20.711 --> 53:25.307
<i>This game is nationally televised,
so most Heisman voters will be watching.</i>

53:25.382 --> 53:27.316
<i>I think a more casual approach
is better.</i>

53:27.384 --> 53:30.012
Controlled, modest, casual.

53:30.087 --> 53:32.578
- Okay.
- Okay, thank you.

53:32.656 --> 53:35.921
<i>I'll make this take two.
Here we go, Joe.</i>

53:35.993 --> 53:40.453
<i>Joe, this game is being billed
as a potential Heisman shootout.</i>

53:40.531 --> 53:42.465
<i>Did you feel any
additional pressure this week,</i>

53:42.533 --> 53:46.401
<i>knowing you'd be going head to head
against Heisman rival, Tim Waymen?</i>

53:46.470 --> 53:49.337
Well, to tell you the truth, Lynn,
I hadrt really thought about it.

53:49.406 --> 53:53.001
<i>So there you have it, folks.
Joe Kane remains unfazed...</i>

53:53.076 --> 53:55.237
<i>before his battle against
Heisman rival, Tim Waymen.</i>

53:55.312 --> 53:57.872
<i>Odds makers have installed Michigan
as a three-point favorite,</i>

53:57.948 --> 54:00.542
<i>but the Timberwolves will have
the advantage of playing...</i>

54:00.617 --> 54:03.677
<i>in the friendly confines
of Wolf Den Stadium.</i>

54:05.756 --> 54:11.126
Hello, Dad? No, I was
just callin' because, uh,

54:11.194 --> 54:14.322
Michigan game is on TV tomorrow
and I thought you might wanna watch it.

54:15.832 --> 54:18.426
It's broke?

54:18.502 --> 54:22.029
Well, can't you go over toJackie B's
and watch it with Jerry?

54:24.341 --> 54:26.332
Oh.

54:26.410 --> 54:30.676
No, fine. Well then uh...
I hope you feel better.

54:30.747 --> 54:33.682
Yeah. Bye.

54:42.326 --> 54:44.886
<i>Are your parents coming
to the game tomorrow?</i>

54:44.962 --> 54:47.396
My mom died
when I was young.

54:47.464 --> 54:50.661
My dad's never
seen me play.

54:50.734 --> 54:52.668
Why not?

54:52.736 --> 54:56.297
I don't know.
I guess he doesn't like football.

54:58.675 --> 55:02.543
- You're one of the best players in the country.
- He's just not into it.

55:02.613 --> 55:05.411
Okay?

55:05.482 --> 55:07.416
Okay.

55:09.953 --> 55:13.480
Kane fades back...
sees his man...

55:16.493 --> 55:18.427
Bad hands.

55:18.495 --> 55:21.396
What's goin' on,
Joe?

55:21.465 --> 55:25.526
You asked me out here like you wanted to talk
about somethin' , but you're not sayin' anything.

55:25.602 --> 55:27.832
<i>Are you worried
about tomorrow?</i>

55:27.904 --> 55:31.863
What do I have to be worried about?
I'm a Heisman candidate, remember?

55:31.942 --> 55:35.503
Joe, why are you thinkin'
like this?

55:35.579 --> 55:39.709
You're havin' a great year. You've got
millions of dollars waitin' for you in the pros.

55:39.783 --> 55:42.650
How do you know
what's waitin' for me?

55:42.719 --> 55:45.085
You don't
even know me.

55:47.491 --> 55:49.755
I don't know you?
How could you say that?

55:49.826 --> 55:52.226
'Cause if you did,
you wouldn't be with me.

55:52.295 --> 55:54.786
You only know the guy who's supposed
to be makin' millions in the pros.

55:54.865 --> 55:57.026
That's what you think?
That I'm with you for the money?

55:57.100 --> 56:00.228
- I don't know why you're with me!
- Fuck you!

56:00.303 --> 56:02.635
You know, maybe you're right.
Maybe I don't know you.

56:59.830 --> 57:02.355
Joe!

57:05.902 --> 57:09.838
Joe, what are you doin' ?
Get off the track.

57:10.000 --> 57:12.609
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:12.609 --> 57:15.203
Joe!
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:15.203 --> 57:19.549
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:19.549 --> 57:22.000
No!
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:22.000 --> 57:22.017
No!

57:22.085 --> 57:25.316
Joe! Joe!
Oh, my God!

57:27.023 --> 57:29.548
Joe!

57:29.626 --> 57:32.720
<i>Oh, God, Joe.! No.!</i>

57:40.036 --> 57:42.197
Joe!

57:46.439 --> 57:49.602
Joe, are you all right?
You okay?

57:49.675 --> 57:51.734
Yes.

57:53.312 --> 57:57.146
- Just lettin' off some steam.
- Why do you do this crazy shit?

57:57.216 --> 58:00.811
- You should've got away from me
while you still had the chance.

58:00.886 --> 58:06.017
I don't wanna get away from you.
What's wrong, Joe?

58:06.092 --> 58:09.027
I'm a Kane,
Camille.

58:09.095 --> 58:11.427
We're just a bunch
of drunks and fuck-ups!

58:11.497 --> 58:14.432
It's what we do.
It's in our blood.

58:14.500 --> 58:19.870
My dad, my uncles, my brothers. We all
drink and sooner or later, we all fuck up.

58:21.474 --> 58:24.500
Sometimes I just feel like
I'm waiting for my turn.

58:24.577 --> 58:27.603
You don't have to be like them.
You can give all that up.

58:27.680 --> 58:30.945
Then what?
Then what would I be?

58:31.016 --> 58:33.507
You'd still beJoe.

58:33.586 --> 58:36.111
And that's enough.

58:47.500 --> 58:49.991
<i>4.;29 to go and it's been a great one,;</i>

58:50.069 --> 58:52.469
<i>two undefeated teams
goin' after each other.</i>

58:52.538 --> 58:54.938
<i>Michigan up by four,
24-20.</i>

58:55.007 --> 58:57.237
But the lead has changed
hands three times.

58:57.309 --> 59:00.710
And, Bo, you get the feelin' that whoever
has the ball last is gonna win it.

59:00.779 --> 59:05.273
Well, it's been billed as a Heisman Trophy
shoot-out. And it's been all of that.

59:05.351 --> 59:08.946
E- S-U, E-S-U, E-S-U!

59:11.290 --> 59:15.989
<i>Third down and eight,
ESU at the Michigan 20.</i>

59:16.061 --> 59:18.222
<i>- Slot right.
- Set!</i>

59:21.300 --> 59:23.734
Blue 80! Motion, motion!

59:23.802 --> 59:27.101
<i>- Blue 80! Hut!
- Watch the blitz.</i>

59:27.173 --> 59:29.767
<i>Kane back to pass.</i>

59:29.842 --> 59:32.402
<i>Can't find anybody.</i>

59:32.478 --> 59:36.642
<i>Gets away.
Gonna run it himself.</i>

59:40.819 --> 59:43.754
<i>At the ten...
the five.</i>

59:47.526 --> 59:50.927
<i>Touchdown, ESU.!
What a run by Kane.</i>

59:55.334 --> 59:59.464
<i>And Kane is still down.
He took quite a shot from Ryan.</i>

59:59.538 --> 01:00:02.564
- You all right?
- Sit him up.

01:00:02.641 --> 01:00:05.075
You sure you feel okay?

01:00:05.144 --> 01:00:08.773
- Yeah.
- He probably just got the wind knocked out of him.

01:00:10.649 --> 01:00:13.345
It was a hell of a run, man.

01:00:13.419 --> 01:00:16.650
- How's the head?
- Fine.

01:00:16.722 --> 01:00:20.988
<i>- ESU in a eight-man line looking for
the run on third and short. - Ready!</i>

01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:23.961
Hey, powder puff. You're the white
boy who ratted my brother out.

01:00:24.029 --> 01:00:29.194
<i>Sent him tojail. Kept that fuckin' money
though, huh? Left the blood to do the time.</i>

01:00:29.268 --> 01:00:31.293
<i>Yeah, you're
the little bastard.</i>

01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:34.999
On the count of you, my brother's dating
his cell mate. I'm gonna make you pay!

01:00:35.074 --> 01:00:38.475
<i>You hear me, powder puff?
I'm gonna make you my cell mate.</i>

01:00:38.544 --> 01:00:43.208
- Mayday, mayday.
- You're gonna have 250 pounds of pissed off nigger up yo' ass!

01:00:43.282 --> 01:00:45.477
Hut-hut!

01:00:45.551 --> 01:00:48.247
<i>- Mack on the blitz.
- Uuuh!</i>

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:52.154
<i>- Pass! Pass!
Waymers goin' for it all.</i>

01:00:57.463 --> 01:01:02.400
<i>Hunt's got a step. He's got it.
Touchdown, Michigan.!</i>

01:01:04.403 --> 01:01:08.897
<i>- This is our house now!
- Steve, that was a great clutch throw under pressure.</i>

01:01:08.974 --> 01:01:11.841
You just can't do it
much better than that.

01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:14.970
- Is he all right, Doc? You ready to go?
- Yup.

01:01:15.047 --> 01:01:16.981
- Yeah.
- You sure?

01:01:17.049 --> 01:01:19.847
- Yeah, just got a little headache. Let's go!
- Let's get 'em.

01:01:19.918 --> 01:01:23.479
Come on now, let's go! Let's get
it back! Get it up, come on, man!

01:01:23.555 --> 01:01:27.082
We can get it back.
Now, come on, let's jack it up!

01:01:27.159 --> 01:01:29.957
Get out there.
Let's go!

01:01:32.031 --> 01:01:35.467
Ray, come here.
Jefferson, in this series.

01:01:35.534 --> 01:01:38.094
What the fuck is...

01:01:38.170 --> 01:01:41.936
<i>Pick that up. Pick it up!</i>

01:01:44.209 --> 01:01:47.701
Ball at the Michigan 47.
1:02 to play,

01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:50.112
<i>as Kane brings 'em to
the line of scrimmage.</i>

01:01:50.182 --> 01:01:53.049
<i>- Set.!
- They shift to the I-formation.</i>

01:01:53.118 --> 01:01:57.214
Brown 34!
Brown 34!

01:01:57.289 --> 01:02:00.622
Hut!

01:02:00.693 --> 01:02:03.093
<i>Kane back to pass.</i>

01:02:03.162 --> 01:02:06.131
Aaah!

01:02:07.866 --> 01:02:10.733
<i>Setting up the screen.</i>

01:02:12.071 --> 01:02:16.201
<i>It's to Darnell Jefferson
who has blockers.</i>

01:02:16.275 --> 01:02:18.505
Right there.
Right there!

01:02:20.679 --> 01:02:22.670
Come on.

01:02:22.748 --> 01:02:26.149
<i>Bumped out ofbounds at the 20.
Great run byJefferson.</i>

01:02:28.654 --> 01:02:32.886
No stick, baby. You ain't got nothin' for me.
Hit me harder than that. Come with it, baby.

01:02:32.958 --> 01:02:35.256
There wasrt nothin' .
There wasrt nothin' !

01:02:35.327 --> 01:02:38.524
Yea!

01:02:38.597 --> 01:02:40.690
Go, Wolves, go!

01:02:40.766 --> 01:02:43.792
All right, bring it in.
Nice run, baby, nice run.

01:02:43.869 --> 01:02:45.894
Okay, listen up.

01:02:45.971 --> 01:02:48.735
L- right, P-25,
Tailback-C.

01:02:48.807 --> 01:02:52.265
Let's put the women and children to bed
and go lookin' for dinner. On two, ready...

01:02:52.344 --> 01:02:54.539
Break!

01:03:00.686 --> 01:03:05.555
<i>ESU, first and ten at the 20.
Just 34 seconds remaining.</i>

01:03:05.624 --> 01:03:08.024
Hut!

01:03:09.294 --> 01:03:12.786
<i>Kane, play action.</i>

01:03:12.865 --> 01:03:15.800
<i>- Aaah!
- Pressure from the backside.</i>

01:03:15.868 --> 01:03:17.859
<i>Looking forJefferson.</i>

01:03:18.604 --> 01:03:21.869
Eee-aaah!

01:03:24.376 --> 01:03:29.643
<i>It's intercepted. Intercepted by
Whitney. And that should do it.</i>

01:03:29.715 --> 01:03:32.479
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah!

01:03:35.254 --> 01:03:40.055
<i>It was everything we expected it to be.
Fine performances on both sides of the field.</i>

01:03:40.125 --> 01:03:43.561
<i>The edge in the much ballyhooed battle of
the quarterbacks would probably have to go...</i>

01:03:43.629 --> 01:03:45.597
<i>to Michigars Tim Waymen.</i>

01:03:45.664 --> 01:03:47.996
<i>Joe Kane accounted
for two ESU touchdowns...</i>

01:03:48.066 --> 01:03:50.591
<i>but had that crucial interception
in the waning moments,</i>

01:03:50.669 --> 01:03:52.603
<i>and that proved
to be the difference.</i>

01:03:52.671 --> 01:03:54.901
Where's Kane?
Where's Joe Kane?

01:04:14.426 --> 01:04:17.020
Take care,
all of you.

01:04:22.801 --> 01:04:24.826
- What's up, Autumn?
- Hey, Darnell.

01:04:24.903 --> 01:04:26.837
- How you doin' ?
- Good.

01:04:26.905 --> 01:04:30.068
- This must your father.
- Yeah, this is my dad, Lou Haley.

01:04:30.142 --> 01:04:32.076
Hi.
DarnellJefferson.

01:04:32.144 --> 01:04:34.840
Jefferson. Nice run you made
on that screen pass.

01:04:34.913 --> 01:04:38.610
- Another block, you might have scored.
- We'll get 'em next year.

01:04:38.684 --> 01:04:41.744
How do you and Autumn know each
other? You a friend of Ray's?

01:04:45.123 --> 01:04:47.523
No. Actually...

01:04:47.593 --> 01:04:49.959
<i>- I tutor Darnell.
- Oh, really.</i>

01:04:50.028 --> 01:04:53.464
- In what?
- In math and English.

01:04:53.532 --> 01:04:56.831
<i>Ah. Well, stay on top of that,
Darnell.</i>

01:04:56.902 --> 01:05:01.464
I'd have been in real trouble if I hadrt
gotten my degree. I played ball once.

01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:04.168
<i>I used to put a copy
of my report card inside...</i>

01:05:04.243 --> 01:05:09.203
my helmet to remind me that college
was more important than football.

01:05:09.281 --> 01:05:13.081
That's a good idea. If you'll
excuse me, I gotta get goin' .

01:05:13.151 --> 01:05:16.678
- Nice to meet you, sir.
- Nice to meet you, Darnell.

01:05:17.890 --> 01:05:20.825
- Hey, Ray.
- Hey, Mr. Haley. Good to see you.

01:05:20.893 --> 01:05:23.020
<i>Still havin' dinner
with us tonight?</i>

01:05:23.095 --> 01:05:26.622
<i>- I wouldn't miss it.
- That was a tough loss today, man.</i>

01:05:26.698 --> 01:05:28.791
Yeah, yeah,
I thought we had 'em.

01:05:47.219 --> 01:05:51.121
Wait. I think we better
get back downstairs.

01:05:51.189 --> 01:05:54.716
- Leslie, we're just gettin' to know
each other. - No, I-I-I better...

01:05:54.793 --> 01:05:58.490
- You didn't come up here to stop.
- What are you doing?

01:05:59.231 --> 01:06:01.859
Aaah!
Aaa-aaah!

01:06:01.934 --> 01:06:04.903
Stop!

01:06:04.970 --> 01:06:08.701
- No! No! No!
- What were you doin' ?

01:06:08.774 --> 01:06:11.834
<i>Leadin' me on?</i>

01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:14.902
- Aaah!
- Come here!

01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:17.312
You're not goin'
anywhere!

01:06:17.382 --> 01:06:20.749
Somebody help me!
Help me! Aaah!

01:06:20.819 --> 01:06:23.049
<i>Jesus.! Get off!</i>

01:06:23.121 --> 01:06:25.646
Please!

01:06:25.724 --> 01:06:27.351
Ah! Aaah!

01:06:27.426 --> 01:06:29.690
Get off of me!

01:06:29.761 --> 01:06:32.958
- Get off of me!
- What the fuck are you thinkin' ?

01:06:33.031 --> 01:06:36.990
- Get off of me!
- Lat, goddammit, chill!

01:06:37.069 --> 01:06:40.129
Well, it looks like this
will all blow over.

01:06:40.205 --> 01:06:42.139
The girl's father's
a big booster,

01:06:42.207 --> 01:06:45.074
contributes a lot of money, so he
says they won't go to the press.

01:06:45.143 --> 01:06:48.078
<i>- He said that, the father?
- Yeah.</i>

01:06:48.146 --> 01:06:51.877
I mean, he's not exactly happy about all
this but he doesn't want to hurt the program.

01:06:51.950 --> 01:06:54.680
We're still gonna have to
suspend the boy.

01:06:54.753 --> 01:06:59.087
He's never tested positive.
If we suspend him now without any proof,

01:06:59.157 --> 01:07:01.682
he could sue us for jeopardizing
his draft status.

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:04.456
What am I supposed to do, sit around
and wait until he kills somebody?

01:07:04.529 --> 01:07:07.760
Three games.
Why so many?

01:07:07.833 --> 01:07:10.233
So many?

01:07:10.302 --> 01:07:13.999
You're lucky I didn't suspend you
for the whole season.

01:07:14.072 --> 01:07:16.540
What are you gonna
give as a reason?

01:07:16.608 --> 01:07:20.601
I'm gonna tell 'em
you pulled a hamstring.

01:07:20.679 --> 01:07:24.877
- Thank you, Coach.
- Don't thank me. You got three weeks.

01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:29.114
Three weeks to kick these 'roids 'cause when
you come back it's not gonna be any NCAA crap.

01:07:29.187 --> 01:07:33.123
I am gonna personally test you before
every game. Watch you go in the bottle.

01:07:33.191 --> 01:07:37.127
- You got that?
- Yes, sir.

01:07:37.195 --> 01:07:40.995
I'm sorry about all this.

01:07:41.066 --> 01:07:43.830
Go on.
Go practice your limp.

01:07:53.979 --> 01:07:56.880
Well, to a couple of real
college heroes, huh?

01:07:58.717 --> 01:08:02.676
This is the first time I lost a game
and a girl on the same fuckin' day, man.

01:08:02.754 --> 01:08:06.212
<i>Guess when you think about it,
I never really had the girl.</i>

01:08:07.893 --> 01:08:11.659
- You know that guy?
- Not really.

01:08:11.730 --> 01:08:14.665
- Then why you smilin' at him?
- I don't know.

01:08:14.733 --> 01:08:17.997
He looks like that ESU quarterback
guy, Joe what's-his-name.

01:08:18.069 --> 01:08:22.439
- So what? So you go and smile at him.
- I wasrt really...

01:08:22.506 --> 01:08:25.442
I feel like an ink spot in a bowl
of milk. Let's get outta here.

01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:27.444
You lookin'
at my girl?

01:08:27.511 --> 01:08:31.038
<i>- I don't know. Which one is she?
- Wise guy, huh?</i>

01:08:31.116 --> 01:08:33.140
Mr. Big-time quarterback.

01:08:33.218 --> 01:08:37.551
- The one who choked his ass off today.
- I'm really not in the mood.

01:08:37.622 --> 01:08:40.988
What, you got nothin' better
to do than look at my girl?

01:08:41.059 --> 01:08:43.118
Hey, Heisman,
I'm talkin' to you.

01:08:43.194 --> 01:08:45.823
<i>I said, I'm talkin'
to you, Heisman.</i>

01:08:45.897 --> 01:08:50.027
- Are you too good to talk to me?
- Yeah, but I'm not too good to tear a hole in your townie ass.

01:08:50.102 --> 01:08:52.969
<i>Think you're a bad ass, huh?
You think my girl's hot for you?</i>

01:08:53.037 --> 01:08:55.700
- Probably.
- Let me tell you somethin' , take off your pads,

01:08:55.774 --> 01:08:58.334
you're nothin'
but another pussy.

01:09:00.345 --> 01:09:02.676
- Oooh!
- Eee-uuh!

01:09:02.747 --> 01:09:06.548
Aaah!

01:09:14.993 --> 01:09:18.689
Come on, let's get the fuck outta
here! Get the fuck outta the way!

01:09:18.764 --> 01:09:21.358
<i>Come on, try to get him up.</i>

01:09:22.968 --> 01:09:27.598
Hey, Joe, could you do us a favor
and slow your drunk ass down?

01:09:27.671 --> 01:09:30.402
Damn, Bud wouldn't like
you driving his truck like this.

01:09:30.475 --> 01:09:33.341
- Bud won't care.
He doesn't know I have it.

01:09:33.411 --> 01:09:35.002
Shit!

01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:38.447
Aw, shit!
Perfect ending to a fucked up day!

01:09:41.286 --> 01:09:44.743
It hit every newspaper, every wire
service. The guy had to go to the hospital.

01:09:44.823 --> 01:09:47.689
And to make things worse, you
get picked up for drunk driving.

01:09:47.759 --> 01:09:50.591
<i>Now, I just can't
clean this stuff up.</i>

01:09:51.897 --> 01:09:56.425
I, uh... I had to agree...
to send you to rehab.

01:09:59.070 --> 01:10:01.538
Rehab?

01:10:01.606 --> 01:10:05.007
Oh, that's fucking...
I'm gonna be a fucking joke!

01:10:05.076 --> 01:10:08.534
<i>- Why don't you fix this like you fix everything else?
- No, I can't.</i>

01:10:08.613 --> 01:10:12.379
It's the only way I can get 'em
to drop the DWI and the assault.

01:10:12.450 --> 01:10:14.941
We risk a definite
NCAA investigation.

01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:17.989
You go to trial,
I'll lose you for a whole year.

01:10:18.056 --> 01:10:21.219
<i>You know how many athletes
have gone to rehab?</i>

01:10:21.293 --> 01:10:24.319
Not in the middle
of a Heisman campaign.

01:10:24.396 --> 01:10:27.593
So you miss... You miss four games.
You come back in time...

01:10:27.666 --> 01:10:30.430
<i>for the last one against Georgia Tech
and then possibly a bowl game.</i>

01:10:30.502 --> 01:10:32.561
Then you got
your whole senior year.

01:10:32.637 --> 01:10:35.470
Jesus.

01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:38.600
You make the best of this, Joe.

01:10:39.744 --> 01:10:42.338
I mean, stuff happens.

01:10:46.484 --> 01:10:49.976
<i>Darnell. Darnell.</i>

01:10:50.055 --> 01:10:52.523
Darnell,
wait up.

01:10:53.825 --> 01:10:56.817
Hey, I been tryin' to call you.
Where ya been?

01:10:56.895 --> 01:10:59.864
- I've been busy.
- Hey.

01:10:59.931 --> 01:11:04.300
If it's about Saturday, I-I'm sorry.
It was just a real awkward situation.

01:11:04.369 --> 01:11:08.863
No, it wasrt awkward, Autumn, it was
educational. I realize how you see me now.

01:11:08.940 --> 01:11:13.377
I'm good enough to tutor, to go places with
but not good enough to tell your father about.

01:11:13.445 --> 01:11:18.212
Darnell, that is not it. My father expects
me to be with somebody like Ray, all right?

01:11:18.283 --> 01:11:20.649
- He wouldn't understand us.
- Why?

01:11:20.719 --> 01:11:24.655
'Cause he's a good student, I'm not.
'Cause he acts right, I don't.

01:11:24.723 --> 01:11:28.489
'Cause he doesn't need football, I do.
'Cause he's class and I'm not, right?

01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:32.360
- Darnell, I didn't say that.
- You don't have to say that, Autumn.

01:11:32.430 --> 01:11:35.695
I'm everything your father used to be
and don't want you fallin' back into.

01:11:35.767 --> 01:11:38.759
- Darnell...
- Look, you was right from jump.

01:11:38.837 --> 01:11:41.328
I should've got
another tutor.

01:11:41.406 --> 01:11:45.069
Thanks for everything
you did for me.

01:12:26.651 --> 01:12:29.916
Well, here's your room.
Just let us know if you need anything.

01:12:29.988 --> 01:12:32.081
Thanks.

01:12:38.463 --> 01:12:42.797
<i>Hey, Bud, is it true what I'm
hearin' ? Joe's out four fucking weeks?</i>

01:12:42.867 --> 01:12:44.732
<i>- Yeah.
- Shit.</i>

01:12:44.803 --> 01:12:48.637
Defense is gonna
have to pitch shutouts now!

01:12:48.707 --> 01:12:53.076
And you're gone for three? What
the hell did you take that shit for?

01:12:53.144 --> 01:12:55.908
Nobody seemed to mind
when I was layin' people out.

01:12:55.981 --> 01:12:58.677
Shit, I bust chops too.
You don't see me all fucked up!

01:12:58.750 --> 01:13:02.982
Not everybody has your ability, Alvin.
You do what you have to do to play.

01:13:03.054 --> 01:13:06.217
Well, you're not playing
much now, are you? Shit!

01:13:06.291 --> 01:13:09.260
<i>Whole fuckin' season
down the drain.!</i>

01:13:17.369 --> 01:13:20.202
<i>Yeah?</i>

01:13:22.073 --> 01:13:24.769
You have a phone call.
A Camille Schaeffer?

01:13:24.843 --> 01:13:29.439
<i>- She says she's your girlfriend?
- I don't want to talk to her right now.</i>

01:13:29.514 --> 01:13:31.778
Okay.

01:13:36.688 --> 01:13:41.216
<i>I'm sorry, he doesn't wish
to speak to you right now.</i>

01:13:49.267 --> 01:13:53.203
- What's he sayin' now?
- With Joe out, everything could be up for grabs again.

01:13:53.271 --> 01:13:55.569
What is that you're
trying to say?

01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:59.007
- We gotta get Bobby Collins back.
- Wait a minute.

01:13:59.077 --> 01:14:02.774
- Did Wilson say that?
- No, no, the pressure's coming from the alumni.

01:14:02.847 --> 01:14:05.941
- Wilsors not gonna stand in the way though.
- Yeah, well, forget it.

01:14:06.017 --> 01:14:11.045
I know he's no all-star but he's good enough
to give us a split over the next four games.

01:14:11.122 --> 01:14:13.784
This is my program
and I'll decide who plays.

01:14:13.858 --> 01:14:16.349
Don't give me that high
and mighty bullshit.

01:14:16.428 --> 01:14:18.362
There are a lot of
people on the bubble.

01:14:18.430 --> 01:14:21.160
Four straight losses
and we're out of bowl contention.

01:14:21.232 --> 01:14:24.167
How the hell is that
gonna make you look?

01:14:27.972 --> 01:14:30.873
<i>Therefore, members
of the board,</i>

01:14:30.942 --> 01:14:35.970
I respectfully submit that Bobby Collins
should not be given special treatment...

01:14:36.047 --> 01:14:39.107
just because
he's a football player.

01:14:39.184 --> 01:14:43.883
Would a regular student get a reinstatement
hearing if they'd been caught cheating?

01:14:43.955 --> 01:14:48.790
Nobody's talking about letting the
young woman who took the test back in.

01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:53.991
I think it's also instructive to look at
some of the courses this young man has taken.

01:14:54.065 --> 01:14:57.398
Beginning Golf,
Voice And Speech Improvement...

01:14:57.469 --> 01:15:02.304
I would like to point out that Mr. Collins was
still right on schedule to receive his degree.

01:15:02.373 --> 01:15:05.399
In what...
Swimming Pool Management?

01:15:05.477 --> 01:15:08.002
Old pompous ass.
I'd like to take his...

01:15:08.079 --> 01:15:11.708
<i>- Would you like to respond, Coach Winters?
- What's that, sir?</i>

01:15:11.783 --> 01:15:15.014
Would you like to respond?

01:15:15.086 --> 01:15:18.886
Oh, yeah.
Um... yes. Um...

01:15:20.225 --> 01:15:23.786
I don't know a whole lot
about this stuff here.

01:15:23.862 --> 01:15:26.888
But I do know
that the, uh...

01:15:26.965 --> 01:15:29.593
the punishment
should fit the crime.

01:15:29.667 --> 01:15:32.500
Now,
cheatin' s bad.

01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:36.301
And, uh...
I- I don't believe that...

01:15:36.374 --> 01:15:39.366
you know, it deserves
a lifelong sentence.

01:15:39.444 --> 01:15:43.642
Now, here we have a student
athlete who's taking...

01:15:43.715 --> 01:15:48.084
college level courses,
wants to graduate.

01:15:48.153 --> 01:15:50.485
Uh...

01:15:53.124 --> 01:15:57.322
He's-He's made a mistake.
Bobby here's made a mistake. And uh...

01:15:57.395 --> 01:16:01.627
he's been suspended for several weeks,
so I-I think he's served his time...

01:16:01.699 --> 01:16:05.328
<i>- and deserves a second chance.
- Like Alvin Mack?</i>

01:16:05.403 --> 01:16:09.772
We gave him a second chance.
Since, he's had five incompletes,

01:16:09.841 --> 01:16:13.174
four withdrawals and still reads
at a fourth-grade level.

01:16:15.747 --> 01:16:20.309
If you don't reinstate Bobby or you hadrt
admitted Alvin, you were taking away their futures.

01:16:20.385 --> 01:16:24.685
And in Alvirs case, that could cost
him millions of dollars in the pros.

01:16:24.756 --> 01:16:29.659
<i>But this is not a football vocational
school. It's an institute ofhigher learning.</i>

01:16:29.727 --> 01:16:32.662
And when was the last time
80,000 people showed up...

01:16:32.730 --> 01:16:35.028
to see a kid do a damn
chemistry experiment?

01:16:35.099 --> 01:16:39.365
<i>- Why don't you stick the bow tie up your ass?
- Gentlemen, please.</i>

01:16:39.437 --> 01:16:42.702
<i>- S-Sorry. - Let's get back
to the business at hand.;</i>

01:16:42.774 --> 01:16:45.140
<i>Bobby Collins.</i>

01:16:45.210 --> 01:16:47.770
As you know,
I played football here.

01:16:47.845 --> 01:16:51.747
<i>And I remember how hard it was to practice
and then study when you're dead tired.</i>

01:16:51.816 --> 01:16:57.311
So, I have some sympathy for this
young man. But I never cheated.

01:16:57.388 --> 01:17:00.846
<i>So the real question is
his character.</i>

01:17:00.925 --> 01:17:03.758
<i>Since you know him better
than anyone else in this room...</i>

01:17:03.828 --> 01:17:07.320
and having talked to him and observed
him over the last several weeks,

01:17:07.398 --> 01:17:09.923
<i>do you think
he's learned his lesson?</i>

01:17:10.001 --> 01:17:12.231
In other words,
can you vouch for his character?

01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:24.571
Sure...
Yes.

01:17:24.649 --> 01:17:27.049
Uh, yes I can.

01:17:33.891 --> 01:17:37.691
<i>So the Wolves,
despite a sputtering offense,</i>

01:17:37.762 --> 01:17:40.026
<i>edge the Boston College Eagles
today, 14 to ten.</i>

01:17:40.098 --> 01:17:45.661
<i>ESU stayed mostly on the ground as the
passing game was largely ineffective.</i>

01:17:47.839 --> 01:17:51.240
<i>Be all that I can be</i>

01:17:51.309 --> 01:17:54.073
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

01:17:54.145 --> 01:17:56.079
<i>Say I can say...</i>

01:17:59.050 --> 01:18:02.144
<i>That'll do it from here
as ESU was blanked this afternoon...</i>

01:18:02.220 --> 01:18:05.087
<i>by a very tough Texas team,
13 to nothing.</i>

01:18:05.156 --> 01:18:08.956
<i>The Wolves defense led by Alvin Mack kept
'em in it but turnovers led to both...</i>

01:18:09.027 --> 01:18:12.895
<i>Longhorn scores.</i>

01:18:12.964 --> 01:18:15.398
<i>- Wanting love is all
that I feel</i>

01:18:15.466 --> 01:18:18.401
<i>When you're passing by</i>

01:18:18.469 --> 01:18:21.563
<i>Wanting love
is all that I see</i>

01:18:21.639 --> 01:18:25.405
<i>It's there in your eyes</i>

01:18:27.545 --> 01:18:31.982
<i>Well, ESU on the strength
of a 62-yard touchdown run...</i>

01:18:32.050 --> 01:18:35.019
<i>by steadily improving
freshman Darnell Jefferson,</i>

01:18:35.086 --> 01:18:38.749
<i>squeaks by the North Carolina
Tar Heels today, 14-13,</i>

01:18:38.823 --> 01:18:43.556
<i>keeping their once-fading
bowl hopes very much alive.</i>

01:18:43.628 --> 01:18:46.119
<i>Hey.!
How you doin' ?</i>

01:18:46.197 --> 01:18:48.757
You suitin' up today?
All right!

01:18:48.833 --> 01:18:51.825
The man is back!
Lattimer's back!

01:18:55.773 --> 01:18:58.037
What's up?

01:18:58.109 --> 01:19:02.341
<i>ESU hoping to get past
a tough Iowa Hawkeye's team...</i>

01:19:02.413 --> 01:19:06.008
<i>in their last game
before the return ofJoe Kane.</i>

01:19:08.086 --> 01:19:11.817
<i>All set to go now.
Thigpen, the remaining setback.</i>

01:19:11.889 --> 01:19:17.293
Damn, I know you, motherfucker. You're
the one who got my baby sister pregnant.

01:19:17.362 --> 01:19:19.557
Where you been, huh?

01:19:19.630 --> 01:19:22.394
- Aw, come on, don't punk out
behind that mask now.

01:19:22.467 --> 01:19:25.664
Answer me, motherfucker,
before I peel your cap!

01:19:27.138 --> 01:19:30.665

- Oooh!</i>

01:19:37.915 --> 01:19:40.577
<i>- Mack pursues inside.
- Aaa-aaah!</i>

01:19:40.651 --> 01:19:44.712
<i>Oooh.! He's leveled by Morgan.</i>

01:19:44.789 --> 01:19:48.281
<i>And Mack is down.</i>

01:19:48.359 --> 01:19:51.487
<i>He's hurt.
They're gathered around him.</i>

01:19:51.562 --> 01:19:55.999
<i>The doctor is coming out.
We can only hope this is not serious.</i>

01:19:58.269 --> 01:20:00.760
<i>- It's all right, Alvin. Hang in there.
- Oh, shit!</i>

01:20:00.838 --> 01:20:02.601
Stretcher!

01:20:02.673 --> 01:20:07.042
<i>You're gonna be okay, Alvin. The doctor's
gonna take a look at you. Just relax.</i>

01:20:07.111 --> 01:20:09.636

01:20:09.714 --> 01:20:10.000

01:21:05.470 --> 01:21:09.338
Why do your teams seem to nosedive
at the end of the last couple seasons?

01:21:11.742 --> 01:21:15.075
Tonight was a tough loss,
but it wasrt a nosedive.

01:21:15.146 --> 01:21:18.946
We've had a few key players out.
We lost another great one tonight.

01:21:19.016 --> 01:21:21.450
But I thought you would know
that if we won next week,

01:21:21.519 --> 01:21:23.953
we'd still be conference champs
and go to a major bowl.

01:21:24.021 --> 01:21:28.117
See, I always knew you guys couldn't write
but I thought at least you could count.

01:21:32.797 --> 01:21:35.231
Yo, Alvin.

01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:39.565
Hey, Coach.

01:21:39.637 --> 01:21:43.004
- How you feelin' ?
- I feel all right.

01:21:44.041 --> 01:21:46.976
- You're lookin' pretty good.
- Yeah.

01:21:48.246 --> 01:21:51.340
Hey, uh, any of the guys
come down to see you?

01:21:51.415 --> 01:21:54.043
They called.

01:21:54.118 --> 01:21:57.315
You know... how football players
are about hospitals and injuries.

01:21:57.388 --> 01:21:59.322
Yeah.

01:22:02.093 --> 01:22:05.187
I'm never gonn...
I'm never gonna play again, am I?

01:22:10.134 --> 01:22:13.126
Doctors aren't always right.

01:22:17.241 --> 01:22:20.870
<i>Either way,
I want you to know that, uh...</i>

01:22:20.945 --> 01:22:25.177
you're the best damn defensive player
I ever coached.

01:23:11.028 --> 01:23:13.997
No problem.

01:23:28.846 --> 01:23:30.780
Hi.

01:23:30.848 --> 01:23:32.975
How ya doin' ?
How's Ray?

01:23:33.050 --> 01:23:38.488
I don't know. I haven't seen him since
the last night I saw you.

01:23:40.024 --> 01:23:41.992
Well,

01:23:42.059 --> 01:23:45.256
I just came by to see
how your studying was coming.

01:23:45.329 --> 01:23:48.230
- Ready for tomorrow?
- Hope so.

01:23:48.299 --> 01:23:50.324
I been studying
pretty hard.

01:23:50.401 --> 01:23:52.733
Good.

01:23:58.909 --> 01:24:01.742
I talked to my dad
last night.

01:24:01.812 --> 01:24:04.246
- How's he doin' ?
- Fine.

01:24:04.315 --> 01:24:07.284
Tell him
I said "hello. "

01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:11.179
We talked about you.

01:24:14.158 --> 01:24:16.422
What'd you say?

01:24:17.495 --> 01:24:21.591
Well... I told him
that we'd gone out.

01:24:22.566 --> 01:24:24.557
And that...

01:24:24.635 --> 01:24:27.604
I wished I could
still go bowling.

01:24:54.265 --> 01:24:56.233
Hey.

01:24:56.300 --> 01:24:58.427
- How ya doin' , man?
- Hey, Joe. How ya doin' ?

01:24:58.502 --> 01:25:00.868
- It's great to see you.
- What's up? Good to have you back.

01:25:00.938 --> 01:25:04.533
- Good to be back.
- What's up, brother? Next game we blow some people up.

01:25:04.608 --> 01:25:08.305
- You get any throwing done in there?
- Nah, all they got is Ping-Pong.

01:25:08.379 --> 01:25:10.973
Let's get a picture.
Hey, hey...

01:25:11.048 --> 01:25:13.312
Here, get
an aerial view.

01:25:13.384 --> 01:25:17.184
<i>Hey, Joe.</i>

01:25:17.254 --> 01:25:19.518
Lats, watch your boots
on the truck bed.

01:25:29.100 --> 01:25:31.330
<i>Hi.</i>

01:25:32.837 --> 01:25:34.828
How ya doin' ?

01:25:36.841 --> 01:25:38.934
<i>- Fine.
- Good.</i>

01:25:39.009 --> 01:25:40.943
You all right now?

01:25:41.011 --> 01:25:43.036
Yeah, I think so.

01:25:43.114 --> 01:25:46.743
I got a few loose ends
to tie up but, uh...

01:25:46.817 --> 01:25:48.910
- Good, I'm happy for you.
- Hey.

01:25:50.721 --> 01:25:53.952
I'm sorry that I, you know,
that I didn't wanna...

01:25:55.126 --> 01:25:57.560
That I couldn't
see you.

01:25:57.628 --> 01:25:59.926
You couldn't even
talk to me.

01:26:01.465 --> 01:26:04.730
I was embarrassed.
I cou...

01:26:06.837 --> 01:26:10.796
That's enough of the outs.
Let's run some deeper digs.

01:26:10.875 --> 01:26:14.641
All right, quarterbacks, run your
deeper crossing patterns next.

01:26:17.715 --> 01:26:19.649
Hut!

01:26:22.853 --> 01:26:25.686
<i>Aw, he's rusty, Sam.
I doubt if we can start him.</i>

01:26:25.756 --> 01:26:28.691
Yeah, his head's
just not back into it.

01:26:30.394 --> 01:26:33.056
<i>Boys, I thought we'd try
something different this game.</i>

01:26:33.130 --> 01:26:35.894
Maximize our speed.

01:26:35.966 --> 01:26:40.266
Keep you both in the lineup
at the same time. So, Ray, uh...

01:26:40.337 --> 01:26:43.135
<i>we're moving you
over to fullback.</i>

01:26:43.207 --> 01:26:47.507
<i>Darnell, you'll be our startin'
tailback. Now, not everybody can...</i>

01:26:47.578 --> 01:26:50.672
handle the transition
like this, Ray.

01:26:50.748 --> 01:26:53.182
You think you're
up to it?

01:26:53.250 --> 01:26:55.241
Yes. Yes, sir.

01:26:55.319 --> 01:26:57.685
<i>Good. That's good.</i>

01:27:32.556 --> 01:27:34.751
- How ya doin' , Dad?
- Joe.

01:27:34.825 --> 01:27:37.988
What's this,
they throw you out?

01:27:38.062 --> 01:27:40.587
No.

01:27:45.236 --> 01:27:48.831
- Heard about your little set-to.
They had it on the news here. - Yeah.

01:27:50.875 --> 01:27:53.435
<i>So, what are you doin' here?</i>

01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:57.344
<i>- Just thinkin' about things.
- That's what the damn rehab will do.;</i>

01:27:57.414 --> 01:28:01.680
make you think about a lot of things
you can't do nothin' about.

01:28:03.854 --> 01:28:07.756
I'm wonderin' why you never
came to any of my games.

01:28:07.825 --> 01:28:09.918
I don't know.

01:28:09.994 --> 01:28:12.861
Maybe I didn't wanna
make you nervous.

01:28:12.930 --> 01:28:17.026
You might've tried too hard
and screwed up.

01:28:18.102 --> 01:28:20.764
Yeah, or I might've
done real good.

01:28:20.838 --> 01:28:23.102
How would that've
made you feel?

01:28:23.173 --> 01:28:25.607
What do you mean?

01:28:25.676 --> 01:28:29.840
It might've made you feel bad like maybe you
could've been something more if you tried.

01:28:29.914 --> 01:28:34.351
Maybe I didn't wanna see you get all excited,
all pumped up with pride, when I knew one day...

01:28:34.418 --> 01:28:39.253
<i>- it'd all come crashing down... just like it did.
- Yeah.</i>

01:28:39.323 --> 01:28:41.553
But I'm still here,
ain't I?

01:28:49.033 --> 01:28:52.901
I got one more game
left this season.

01:28:55.940 --> 01:29:00.707
I don't how much I'll play... or if I'll
play at all, but I'd like you to be there.

01:29:03.113 --> 01:29:06.810
How will you feel about introducing
your drunken dad to your friends?

01:29:06.884 --> 01:29:09.079
<i>Did you think about that?</i>

01:29:15.592 --> 01:29:18.959
I could deal with it
if you could.

01:29:25.602 --> 01:29:28.730
This is a plane ticket,

01:29:28.806 --> 01:29:31.798
a ticket for the game,
a 50-yard-line seat.

01:29:42.786 --> 01:29:44.777
If you don't come,

01:29:47.958 --> 01:29:51.860
I'm never going to, um...
ask you again.

01:30:10.848 --> 01:30:12.907
Bill, what's this
doin' again?

01:30:12.983 --> 01:30:16.919
<i>Takin' the doped urine out of your
bladder and puttin' clean back in.</i>

01:30:16.987 --> 01:30:19.649
Call it an oil change.

01:30:28.899 --> 01:30:32.460
<i>- We are gonna
get it done today.</i>

01:30:32.536 --> 01:30:36.063
<i>- We're gonna
ring the bell today.!</i>

01:30:36.140 --> 01:30:38.802
<i>This is what you guys been workin' for.
I need 60 minutes.</i>

01:30:38.876 --> 01:30:41.106
- 60 minutes of mean!
- You got it, Coach.

01:30:41.178 --> 01:30:46.047
60 minutes, no prisoners, no mercy.
Nothing but snot bubbles, snot bubbles!

01:30:46.116 --> 01:30:48.641
You got me?
We're gonna ring the bell!

01:30:48.719 --> 01:30:51.347
We're gonna ring
that championship bell!

01:30:51.422 --> 01:30:54.914
Ding-motherfuckin' -dong!

01:30:58.395 --> 01:31:01.831
<i>Wolves moving
left to right on your radio dial.</i>

01:31:01.899 --> 01:31:05.335
<i>They've had trouble scoring
with Bobby Collins at the helm.</i>

01:31:05.402 --> 01:31:08.235
<i>DespiteJoe Kane's return,
Collins gets the starting nod.</i>

01:31:08.305 --> 01:31:13.106
All right, let's get this off to a good
start. L-28, thunder right, second blue.

01:31:13.177 --> 01:31:14.974
Ready, break.

01:31:15.045 --> 01:31:18.537
<i>Wolves in the I
with a new look.</i>

01:31:18.615 --> 01:31:20.173
Set!

01:31:20.250 --> 01:31:23.742
<i>Jefferson now starting at tailback.
Griffen at full.</i>

01:31:23.821 --> 01:31:26.255
<i>Hut-hut.</i>

01:31:26.323 --> 01:31:28.450
<i>Blue.</i>

01:31:28.525 --> 01:31:32.518
<i>- Collins pitches toJefferson sweeping on thunder right.
- 46, 46!</i>

01:31:32.596 --> 01:31:35.497
<i>Griffen leading
the blocking and... Oh.!</i>

01:31:35.566 --> 01:31:38.194
<i>Pugh goes right by him.</i>

01:31:40.204 --> 01:31:43.765
<i>Oooh, fumble.</i>

01:31:43.841 --> 01:31:47.140
<i>It looks like...
Georgia Tech has the ball.</i>

01:31:47.211 --> 01:31:49.509
<i>And a tough break
for the Wolves...</i>

01:31:49.580 --> 01:31:53.209
<i>as the Yellowjackets will have
excellent field position.</i>

01:31:53.283 --> 01:31:56.548
<i>All right, let's go,
defense.!</i>

01:31:56.620 --> 01:31:58.611
Put your helmets
in their belly!

01:31:58.689 --> 01:32:01.021
Goddammit!

01:32:01.091 --> 01:32:03.889
<i>Shit.!
Punk-ass Griffen.!</i>

01:32:03.961 --> 01:32:05.952
Defense!

01:32:06.029 --> 01:32:08.054
<i>Okay, offense, tough break.</i>

01:32:08.132 --> 01:32:13.593
<i>It was there, wejust didn't execute.! You
gotta finish your blocks. Finish 'em all.!</i>

01:32:13.670 --> 01:32:16.468
<i>Next time we get it, we take control.
Jefferson.!</i>

01:32:16.540 --> 01:32:19.668
<i>You gotta squeeze the ball.!
You gotta put it away.</i>

01:32:19.743 --> 01:32:22.837
<i>So the Wolves'defense
has held after the fumble...</i>

01:32:22.913 --> 01:32:25.473
<i>and the Yellowjackets
will opt for the field goal.</i>

01:32:25.549 --> 01:32:28.143
<i>It's around a 34 yarder.</i>

01:32:28.218 --> 01:32:31.381
<i>Here's the snap.
Ball is down. It's away.</i>

01:32:31.455 --> 01:32:34.913
<i>It's long enough...
and it's good.</i>

01:32:34.992 --> 01:32:39.088
<i>The Georgia Tech Yellowjackets
jump out on top, three to nothing.</i>

01:32:39.163 --> 01:32:41.529
<i>Twenty-five seconds left
in the half.</i>

01:32:41.598 --> 01:32:45.932
<i>Collins is gonna go to the air if the Wolves
hope to get on the board before halftime.</i>

01:32:46.003 --> 01:32:49.996
<i>- Collins fades back to pass.
- Don't throw the flat!</i>

01:32:50.073 --> 01:32:52.667
<i>Looking in the flat for Ward...
The ball is tipped,</i>

01:32:52.743 --> 01:32:54.802
<i>batted around,
intercepted by Wooley.</i>

01:32:54.878 --> 01:32:57.642
<i>Down the sideline,
20... 15...</i>

01:32:57.714 --> 01:33:00.683
<i>ten... touchdown,
Georgia Tech.</i>

01:33:00.751 --> 01:33:04.209
<i>And it looks like the Yellowjackets
will go in at halftime...</i>

01:33:04.288 --> 01:33:06.756
<i>with a ten-nothing lead.</i>

01:33:06.823 --> 01:33:10.156
<i>Come on, guys, we're only down ten.!</i>

01:33:10.227 --> 01:33:13.560
Now let's get our fuckin' shit together
and kick some fuckin' ass!

01:33:13.630 --> 01:33:17.657
<i>Come on, guys, now, we got
30 minutes of football left.!</i>

01:33:17.734 --> 01:33:21.397
<i>- Thirty minutes.! The second half is ours.!
- Yo, motherfucker!</i>

01:33:21.471 --> 01:33:22.904
You missed that
block on purpose.

01:33:22.973 --> 01:33:25.237
Hey, you full of shit!
You fumble, you try to blame me.

01:33:25.309 --> 01:33:28.210
- All this shit is over Autumn.
- Fuck Autumn and fuck you!

01:33:28.278 --> 01:33:30.508
You just can't take a hit,
punk.

01:33:30.581 --> 01:33:32.515
Fucker!

01:33:34.484 --> 01:33:38.511
- Hey, hey, hey!
I'll fuckin' kill your ass!

01:33:38.589 --> 01:33:40.682
Break it up!

01:33:40.757 --> 01:33:42.918
Come on,
let him go!

01:33:42.993 --> 01:33:45.860
Get up!
Come here!

01:33:45.929 --> 01:33:50.866
Come here! I don't wanna hear about who
started it. Save it for the field, understand?

01:33:50.934 --> 01:33:54.097
- Do you understand me!
- Yes, sir.

01:33:54.171 --> 01:33:56.435
Yes, sir.

01:33:56.506 --> 01:33:58.736
Now, the rest
of you guys,

01:33:58.809 --> 01:34:01.903
you play that second half
the way you did the first,

01:34:01.979 --> 01:34:04.846
this is what the rest
of the seasors gonna look like.

01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:14.012
- Don't ever let me see you miss a block again.
- Yeah, Coach.

01:34:14.091 --> 01:34:17.891
Joe, warm yourself up,
you're startin' the second half.

01:34:17.961 --> 01:34:20.395
<i>Yeah, all right.</i>

01:34:20.464 --> 01:34:22.557
Yeah, Joe.

01:34:22.633 --> 01:34:24.624
Oh, Collins.

01:34:24.701 --> 01:34:26.862
Yeah, Coach?

01:34:26.937 --> 01:34:29.906
Get a mop and clean that mess up.

01:34:29.973 --> 01:34:32.635
You gotta be kiddin' me.

01:34:37.381 --> 01:34:40.544
<i>E... S... U!</i>

01:34:40.617 --> 01:34:44.781
<i>Ready to go with the second half
now. Wolves trailing ten-nothing.</i>

01:34:44.855 --> 01:34:48.484
<i>We're told Joe Kane
will be starting at quarterback.</i>

01:34:57.801 --> 01:35:02.363
<i>Listen up, now.! It's time to call
in the Wolves to piss on the fire.!</i>

01:35:02.439 --> 01:35:04.737
<i>Let's go.! Let's go.!</i>

01:35:07.411 --> 01:35:10.346
Ready, break!

01:35:13.917 --> 01:35:17.080
<i>Kane calling signals.</i>

01:35:17.154 --> 01:35:20.123
Blue 80!
Hut!

01:35:20.190 --> 01:35:23.250
<i>Fumbles.
Griffen recovers.</i>

01:35:23.327 --> 01:35:25.352
Come on, Joe.

01:35:25.429 --> 01:35:27.989
Green 25! Hut!

01:35:28.065 --> 01:35:30.260
<i>Kane looking forJefferson
in the flat.</i>

01:35:30.334 --> 01:35:33.997
<i>Under-throws it badly.</i>

01:35:34.071 --> 01:35:36.596
<i>Kane fading to pass.</i>

01:35:36.673 --> 01:35:38.698
<i>Oooh.!
Hit and sacked.</i>

01:35:38.775 --> 01:35:43.235
And Kane's return
is a rocky one so far.

01:35:46.683 --> 01:35:50.175
Joe's too tentative, too cautious
out there. He's flat, Sam. Maybe we...

01:35:50.253 --> 01:35:54.053
- He's gonna be all right. He's gonna get his feel back.
- But we can't afford to...

01:35:54.124 --> 01:35:57.890
I said, he's gonna
be all right.

01:35:57.961 --> 01:36:00.896
<i>5.;51 to go,
Georgia Tech up ten to nothing.</i>

01:36:00.964 --> 01:36:03.865
<i>The Wolves are gonna have to
find some offense in a hurry here.</i>

01:36:03.934 --> 01:36:08.496
<i>Their defense has been
keeping them in it.</i>

01:36:08.572 --> 01:36:11.598
Come on, Joe.
You're not lettin' it go, man.

01:36:11.675 --> 01:36:15.907
Where's that wild man
that used to take charge of this team?

01:36:15.979 --> 01:36:19.210
Hell, I know
you ain't lost that.

01:36:19.282 --> 01:36:22.843
You are the only one
these guys are gonna follow.

01:36:22.919 --> 01:36:26.184
It's time to sit
at the head of the table.

01:36:26.256 --> 01:36:29.225
Let's forget rehab.
Forget your dad.

01:36:29.292 --> 01:36:33.353
There's ten guys out there waiting
for you. It's your family now.

01:36:33.430 --> 01:36:37.127
Look at me, boy.
We need ya.

01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:39.361
We need ya.

01:36:42.139 --> 01:36:44.801
You're the man, Joe.

01:36:46.243 --> 01:36:49.974
Now you go out there
and you play like I know you can.

01:36:50.046 --> 01:36:53.914
<i>- Come on.
- Come on, Joe, let's go.</i>

01:36:53.984 --> 01:36:57.385
<i>So let's see what the Wolves come up
with here as time continues to tick away.</i>

01:36:57.454 --> 01:36:59.888
We've held these guys up
long enough now.

01:36:59.956 --> 01:37:03.949
All right, the masked man is back.
Hi-ho, fuckin' Silver!

01:37:04.027 --> 01:37:07.690
Gimme some time back here and I'll pick
'em apart. Strong left, brown right,

01:37:07.764 --> 01:37:10.597

Ready, break!

01:37:14.971 --> 01:37:17.030

01:37:25.982 --> 01:37:28.678
<i>Kane back to pass.</i>

01:37:28.752 --> 01:37:30.720
<i>Good protection.</i>

01:37:34.090 --> 01:37:37.389
<i>Throws to... Jefferson
on the sideline. He's got it...</i>

01:37:37.461 --> 01:37:40.692
<i>and out ofbounds
at the Yellowjacket 32.</i>

01:37:43.033 --> 01:37:44.864
Hut!

01:37:44.935 --> 01:37:47.335
<i>Kane fades again.</i>

01:37:49.940 --> 01:37:52.238
<i>Fires for Griffen.</i>

01:37:52.309 --> 01:37:56.973
<i>Leaping catch at the 21 as the
Timberwolves are beginning to roll.</i>

01:38:01.618 --> 01:38:05.019
<i>Kane... looks
into the end zone.</i>

01:38:06.656 --> 01:38:09.648
<i>Can't find anybody.
Gonna run it.</i>

01:38:09.726 --> 01:38:13.093
<i>Tucks the ball.

01:38:13.163 --> 01:38:17.099
<i>15... ten.</i>

01:38:17.167 --> 01:38:22.298
<i>Hit... and finally
brought down inside the five.!</i>

01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:27.970
<i>Kane gets it to the four
where it'll be first and goal.</i>

01:38:28.044 --> 01:38:31.104
<i>And there's no doubt about it,
with 3.;45 remaining,</i>

01:38:31.181 --> 01:38:34.344
<i>they've gotta score here
if they wanna get back in this game.</i>

01:38:36.386 --> 01:38:40.117
Hey, Coach, give it to me up the gut.
They've been ignoring me. I can score.

01:38:40.190 --> 01:38:45.218
- Not now, we're going with the sweep. 28 thunder right. Go.
- Go offense!

01:38:45.295 --> 01:38:47.855
- Coach wants?
- L-right, 28 pitch.

01:38:47.931 --> 01:38:52.265
<i>All right. Thunder right,
28 pitch on one. Ready...</i>

01:38:52.335 --> 01:38:54.064

<i>sweeping thunder right.</i>

01:39:09.953 --> 01:39:12.683
<i>Griffen, the lead blocker,
falls down.</i>

01:39:12.756 --> 01:39:15.725
Oh, shit.

01:39:15.792 --> 01:39:19.421
<i>Jefferson hemmed in
at the sideline.</i>

01:39:19.496 --> 01:39:23.057
<i>- Tries to cut back.
- Now you're mine!</i>

01:39:23.133 --> 01:39:27.263
<i>Whoa.! What a great block by Griffen.
Jefferson driving for the end zone.</i>

01:39:27.337 --> 01:39:30.238

01:39:39.749 --> 01:39:42.377
All right! Yes!

01:39:42.452 --> 01:39:45.580
All right, baby,
we're back in it!

01:39:46.756 --> 01:39:49.350
Hey...
nice block, man.

01:39:49.426 --> 01:39:52.691
Hell of a run, rook.
Hell of a fuckin' run.

01:39:52.762 --> 01:39:55.526
Let's take it to 'em, baby.
We're takin' it to 'em.

01:39:56.700 --> 01:39:59.225
Okay, defense,
let's get even.

01:39:59.302 --> 01:40:03.170
Let's kill 'em all.
Let the paramedics sort 'em out.

01:40:03.239 --> 01:40:05.207
<i>1.;11 and counting.</i>

01:40:05.275 --> 01:40:09.803
<i>Third and one. The Wolves have to stop them on
this play if they're gonna get the ball back.</i>

01:40:09.879 --> 01:40:14.475
<i>A first down and it's all she wrote.
ESU is out of time-outs.</i>

01:40:14.551 --> 01:40:18.078
All right, defense,
let's stuff'em one time for Alvin!

01:40:18.154 --> 01:40:21.419
- Four-three stack. Ready, break!
- Yeah, yeah!

01:40:24.594 --> 01:40:27.654
<i>Georgia Tech over the ball.
Thom calling signals.</i>

01:40:27.731 --> 01:40:31.064
<i>Eight-one-eight.!</i>

01:40:31.134 --> 01:40:33.568
Oh... yeah.

01:40:33.637 --> 01:40:35.400
Hut!

01:40:39.509 --> 01:40:44.344
<i>- Hands off to Garrett.
- Aaa-aargh!</i>

01:40:44.414 --> 01:40:47.144
<i>You're a dead man.!</i>

01:40:49.185 --> 01:40:51.983
<i>Stops Garrett for a two-yard loss.</i>

01:40:52.055 --> 01:40:55.752
I don't think you got it, pal!
Ha-Ha!

01:41:00.563 --> 01:41:03.031
Yeah, baby!
Yeah, baby!

01:41:03.099 --> 01:41:08.469
<i>And the Wolves will get the ball back.
Great individual effort by Lattimer.</i>

01:41:13.076 --> 01:41:16.170
All right.
Come here.

01:41:32.796 --> 01:41:35.458
All right, guys,
here we go!

01:41:35.532 --> 01:41:38.899
<i>Georgia Tech in punt formation.
Here's the snap.</i>

01:41:38.968 --> 01:41:42.267
<i>Langdom... puts
the foot to it.</i>

01:41:46.109 --> 01:41:49.374
<i>- Jefferson... settles under it.
- Show time, baby.</i>

01:41:49.446 --> 01:41:51.539
Come on.

01:41:51.614 --> 01:41:54.879
<i>- Starts right.
- Bring it to me.</i>

01:41:54.951 --> 01:41:59.149
<i>No place to go, reverses his field.
Comes back left.</i>

01:41:59.222 --> 01:42:01.156
Come with me.
Come with me.

01:42:01.224 --> 01:42:05.320
<i>Looking for the sideline Whoa.!
A great block by Gibson.</i>

01:42:05.395 --> 01:42:08.660
Right there, 23, 23.
Yeah!

01:42:08.732 --> 01:42:11.724
<i>A great crackback
by Hughes.!</i>

01:42:13.470 --> 01:42:15.438
Yes!

01:42:15.505 --> 01:42:18.804
- Go!
- Go win it! Yeah!

01:42:18.875 --> 01:42:22.868
<i>Another big block.!
One man to beat.</i>

01:42:22.946 --> 01:42:25.540
<i>Knocked out ofbounds
at the 20-yard line.!</i>

01:42:27.751 --> 01:42:29.719
Wooo!
Wooo!

01:42:29.786 --> 01:42:31.981
<i>Offense, offense, let's go.!</i>

01:42:32.055 --> 01:42:35.786
Time for two plays. All right, end
zone's not open, you take the sideline.

01:42:35.859 --> 01:42:38.555
- All right.
- Come on, baby. Come on.

01:42:38.628 --> 01:42:42.325
<i>17 seconds to go.
No time-outs for ESU.</i>

01:42:42.398 --> 01:42:45.925
<i>- Go.! Go.! Go.!
- Set.!</i>

01:42:46.002 --> 01:42:49.870
287! 287! Hut!

01:42:51.374 --> 01:42:53.968
<i>Kane back to pass.</i>

01:42:57.580 --> 01:43:00.242
<i>Forced out of the pocket.
Running right.</i>

01:43:06.890 --> 01:43:10.326
<i>Kane on the run, fires.</i>

01:43:11.661 --> 01:43:14.653
<i>Complete to Griffen
at the ten-yard line.</i>

01:43:14.731 --> 01:43:19.134
<i>Out ofbounds stopping the clock
with seven seconds.</i>

01:43:19.202 --> 01:43:21.762
<i>A field goal here
ties it,</i>

01:43:21.838 --> 01:43:24.773
but a tie may not get
the Wolves into a bowl game.

01:43:24.841 --> 01:43:27.309
This'll be a tough decision
for Winters.

01:43:29.379 --> 01:43:33.839
- What do ya think, go for the three?
- Just gimme the goddamn ball.

01:43:33.917 --> 01:43:37.148
Brown right motion, tail slant.
You're the man, Joe.

01:43:37.220 --> 01:43:39.984
We're about to win!

01:43:40.056 --> 01:43:42.752
- You ready?
- Come on, baby, come on.

01:43:42.826 --> 01:43:44.623
<i>- What sign?
- Let's go.</i>

01:43:44.694 --> 01:43:50.291
All right, everybody, now's the time.
Brown right motion, tailback slant.

01:43:50.366 --> 01:43:55.326
Let's put the women and children to bed and
go lookin' for fuckin' dinner. Ready, break!

01:43:55.405 --> 01:43:59.808
<i>All right, this is the season
as the Timberwolves come...</i>

01:43:59.876 --> 01:44:02.470
<i>- to the line of scrimmage.
- Come on Wolves!</i>

01:44:09.719 --> 01:44:13.553
Go, Wolves, go!

01:44:15.024 --> 01:44:18.289
Yeah. That's okay, Dad.

01:44:21.264 --> 01:44:24.290
Set!

01:44:28.338 --> 01:44:30.806
<i>Gold 13.!</i>

<i>Kane fades back.</i>

01:44:42.218 --> 01:44:45.813
Yippee ki-yi-yo
Git along little dogies

01:44:45.889 --> 01:44:48.380
<i>Can't find anybody.</i>

01:44:48.458 --> 01:44:53.157
<i>Forced out of the pocket.
Mahone misses him.</i>

01:44:53.229 --> 01:44:55.823
<i>Jones has ahold ofhim.</i>

01:44:55.899 --> 01:44:58.834
<i>Kane gets away.
Scrambles right.</i>

01:45:00.069 --> 01:45:02.060
Aaa-aaah!

01:45:03.072 --> 01:45:05.666
<i>Looks downfield

01:45:05.742 --> 01:45:07.710
<i>- Yo!
- He's covered.</i>

01:45:09.646 --> 01:45:13.946
<i>Kane... fumbles the ball.!
Scrambling after it.</i>

01:45:15.718 --> 01:45:18.414
<i>Picks it up.</i>

01:45:18.488 --> 01:45:21.514
See ya.
Closing time, baby.

01:45:21.591 --> 01:45:25.288
<i>Looking into the end zone forJefferson.
Fires on the run.</i>

01:45:27.664 --> 01:45:31.760
<i>Jeffersors got it.!
Touchdown.! ESU wins it.!</i>

01:45:31.834 --> 01:45:34.860
<i>- ESU wins it.!
- Yeah!</i>

01:45:40.443 --> 01:45:43.105
How do you like that, baby?

01:45:43.179 --> 01:45:45.943
We're goin' to a bowl!
We're goin' to a bowl, baby!

01:45:46.015 --> 01:45:48.108
Yes, hon!

01:45:50.620 --> 01:45:53.111
All right.
Now we're talkin' .

01:45:53.189 --> 01:45:54.918
Wooo!
All right! Yeah!

01:45:54.991 --> 01:45:57.289
Yeah, baby!

01:45:57.360 --> 01:46:00.261
We're goin' to a bowl, baby!
Yeah!

01:46:00.330 --> 01:46:02.298
Nice throw.

01:46:02.365 --> 01:46:05.163
We're in
the bowl, baby!

01:46:06.402 --> 01:46:09.269
On to the bowl!
Yeah! All right!

01:46:09.339 --> 01:46:11.534
Yeah!

01:46:40.336 --> 01:46:42.497
- Way to go, baby!
- Yeah, sugar, we did it.

01:46:42.572 --> 01:46:44.506
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:46:44.574 --> 01:46:48.271
- Daddy, you remember Darnell.
- Sure I do. Great catch, Darnell. Great catch.

01:46:48.344 --> 01:46:51.404
Thanks a lot.
I got somethin' for you.

01:46:51.481 --> 01:46:53.949
It's my placement test.
I got an 89.

01:46:54.017 --> 01:46:56.110
I believe
you got an 87.

01:46:56.185 --> 01:47:00.281
<i>- I asked Coach Winters to look it up for me.
- I'll kill him.</i>

01:47:00.356 --> 01:47:04.292
Let's get outta here.

01:47:04.360 --> 01:47:06.954
Hey, Coach.

01:47:07.030 --> 01:47:10.796
Hey, Joe, that was a great throw.
Way to hang in there. I'm proud of you.

01:47:10.867 --> 01:47:12.926
Thanks for everything.

01:47:14.103 --> 01:47:16.298
Thanks for everything
you did for me.

01:47:16.372 --> 01:47:18.499
Next year,
the Heisman, huh?

01:47:18.574 --> 01:47:20.872
Well, uh...

01:47:23.513 --> 01:47:27.074
Don't make an idiot outta me,
okay?

01:47:30.253 --> 01:47:33.188
<i>An amazing conclusion
to a great season.</i>

01:47:33.256 --> 01:47:37.249
We can see Steve Lattimer down on
the bench weeping tears of joy...

01:47:37.326 --> 01:47:42.195
<i>as ESU goes back to a bowl
for the first time in three years.</i>

01:48:02.819 --> 01:48:04.753
Hi.

01:48:04.821 --> 01:48:07.187
What are you
doin' here?

01:48:07.256 --> 01:48:09.247
Just waitin' for you.

01:48:10.860 --> 01:48:13.522
I know I'm not your favorite
person in the world right now,

01:48:13.596 --> 01:48:16.793
but um... I need your help
with something.

01:48:18.468 --> 01:48:23.269
All the pressure's startin' again,
you know. All the Heisman talk and...

01:48:23.339 --> 01:48:27.469
I just... I feel like I need to go out
and blow off some steam and I was...

01:48:27.543 --> 01:48:31.240
I was just wondering if you'd...
go share a six-pack with me?

01:48:52.768 --> 01:48:57.467
Tickets are in your bag. Player profiles,
itinerary, they're in the briefcase.

01:48:57.540 --> 01:49:02.204
Now, we've got a 9 a. m. Tomorrow with
that uh... big linebacker from Park High.

01:49:02.278 --> 01:49:05.941
From there we go to Atlanta. Need
to check out this defensive lineman.

01:49:06.015 --> 01:49:08.643
He might be our replacement
for Lattimer next year.
