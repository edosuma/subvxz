03:00.380 --> 03:04.942
You know, I'm so glad we didn't rush
over there on an early flight.

03:05.118 --> 03:07.211
This way, we get to spend

03:07.387 --> 03:10.652
a traditional Christmas-Eve-day
supper in our own home.

03:10.823 --> 03:13.257
Yeah, who wants to rush off
to Hawaii anyway?

03:13.426 --> 03:15.155
Brandon, are you making fun
of me?

03:15.328 --> 03:17.728
No, Mom, I would never do that.

03:17.897 --> 03:20.661
As a matter of fact,
this is the best Christmas luau

03:20.833 --> 03:21.959
you've ever whipped up.

03:22.135 --> 03:26.037
I'm especially fond
of your cranberry and poi chutney.

03:26.206 --> 03:27.400
Brandon's on a roll.

03:27.574 --> 03:29.633
Well, I happen to agree with Mom.

03:29.809 --> 03:31.538
I'm glad we decided
to take the later flight.

03:31.711 --> 03:33.008
This way we all got to sleep in.

03:33.179 --> 03:37.172
Anything to avoid the flight
over the ocean, huh, sis?

03:37.350 --> 03:40.012
Brenda, you're not anxious
about flying, are you?

03:40.186 --> 03:42.381
No, not really.

03:44.390 --> 03:46.654
Mom, would you pass me
the sweet potatoes, please?

03:46.826 --> 03:47.850
Sure, honey,

03:48.027 --> 03:50.791
but first, I would just like
to take a moment to give thanks

03:50.964 --> 03:52.932
and say how blessed I feel

03:53.099 --> 03:54.532
to be spending another Christmas

03:54.701 --> 03:56.635
with the people I love most
in the world.

03:57.470 --> 03:58.494
Amen.

03:58.972 --> 04:01.031
Sure beats the first Christmas
we had here, huh, Mom?

04:01.207 --> 04:02.435
What are you talking about?

04:02.609 --> 04:05.237
Our first Christmas in California
was lovely.

04:06.846 --> 04:08.336
Talk about a selective memory.

04:08.514 --> 04:11.278
Really, Mom, have you
completely forgotten

04:11.451 --> 04:12.748
what happened that year?

04:13.019 --> 04:15.544
<i>It was like a 100 degrees out,
we were in the middle of a drought</i>

04:15.722 --> 04:17.382
<i>and you were
incredibly homesick.</i>

04:17.557 --> 04:20.117
<i>You were none too pleased with
the pathetic-looking Christmas tree</i>

04:20.293 --> 04:21.624
<i>that Dad and I brought home.</i>

04:21.793 --> 04:26.561
Jim, what happened to the tree?
I mean, it's...

04:26.733 --> 04:28.894
I think the word you're looking for
is dead, Mom.

04:29.068 --> 04:33.095
Oh, it's not really dead,
it's just kind of wilted.

04:33.273 --> 04:37.004
Oh, yes, it's starting
to come back to me.

04:37.176 --> 04:38.803
Do you remember Santa Claus?

04:38.978 --> 04:40.775
Oh, who could forget Santa?

04:40.947 --> 04:42.938
Where did you ever find
that guy anyway?

04:43.116 --> 04:45.380
Hey, he found me.

04:45.785 --> 04:48.379
Remember, I was working
at that trendy boutique on Robertson

04:48.554 --> 04:50.488
<i>with that creep, Deidre,
who kicked him out</i>

04:50.657 --> 04:52.386
<i>even though he wasn't
hurting anyone.</i>

04:52.558 --> 04:54.549
Very funny.
Would you mind leaving, please?

04:54.727 --> 04:57.355
Aren't you in need
of some Christmas cheer?

04:57.530 --> 04:59.521
All I'm in need of
is a security guard

04:59.699 --> 05:02.429
to keep nutcases like you
out of here.

05:02.602 --> 05:04.092
<i>And then the cops
started hassling him.</i>

05:04.270 --> 05:05.464
I don't have any ID.

05:05.638 --> 05:07.162
- Where do you live?
- North Pole.

05:07.340 --> 05:09.035
Smart. You got a place to live, pal?

05:09.208 --> 05:11.403
- What's going on here?
- Don't worry about it.

05:11.577 --> 05:12.771
I know this guy.

05:12.945 --> 05:14.606
You do?

05:14.781 --> 05:16.646
Yeah, he's Santa Claus.

05:16.816 --> 05:18.249
<i>And one thing led to another.</i>

05:18.418 --> 05:20.818
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry... Christmas.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.217
Merry Christmas.

05:23.389 --> 05:24.515
Jim Walsh.

05:24.691 --> 05:26.716
- Saint Nick.
- Saint Nick.

05:26.893 --> 05:28.918
Brenda, you can't just bring
some strange guy

05:29.095 --> 05:30.528
off the street home for dinner.

05:30.697 --> 05:34.360
Why not? Look, it is Christmas
and he is Santa Claus.

05:34.534 --> 05:36.627
Well, who knows who's lurking
under that beard?

05:36.803 --> 05:38.964
My instincts tell me
that he's harmless.

05:39.138 --> 05:41.072
Oh, that makes me feel
a lot better.

05:41.240 --> 05:43.208
Well, fortunately for us,

05:43.376 --> 05:45.776
Santa Claus turned out to be
a wonderful person.

05:45.945 --> 05:47.913
You know what I remember most
about that guy?

05:48.081 --> 05:50.413
The same thing
we all remember the most.

05:52.485 --> 05:54.476
You see, for over 40 years,

05:54.654 --> 05:59.387
Mrs. Claus and I lived
in a big house high up on a hill.

05:59.959 --> 06:03.918
And she made the most wonderful
Christmas dinner.

06:04.097 --> 06:09.125
We had a big tree with loads
of presents for lots of little elves.

06:09.736 --> 06:13.604
But the elves grew up
and they moved away.

06:13.773 --> 06:19.143
And even though it was only she
and Santa left in this big house,

06:19.312 --> 06:24.841
she still made the most splendid
Christmas dinners.

06:25.284 --> 06:29.744
But last year, Mrs. Claus died.

06:29.922 --> 06:34.325
And as far as I was concerned,
Christmas died with her.

06:34.494 --> 06:38.430
I wanted to pretend that Christmas
didn't exist anymore.

06:38.598 --> 06:40.293
But I was beginning to believe

06:40.466 --> 06:44.300
the only place Santa belonged
in this town was in jail.

06:45.071 --> 06:50.771
Until that girl took in
a lonely, old man for dinner.

06:56.883 --> 06:58.407
Hey, Mom, if that's Santa Claus,

06:58.584 --> 07:00.711
tell him I can get him a deal
on some stuffed reindeer.

07:00.887 --> 07:02.980
- Oh, stop.
- Hey.

07:03.156 --> 07:04.851
When's the shuttle coming
to pick us up?

07:05.024 --> 07:06.958
Plane doesn't leave
for another four hours.

07:07.126 --> 07:09.492
Yeah, ho, ho, ho,
and a Merry Christmas.

07:09.662 --> 07:12.153
If it isn't Dylan, what are you,
Santa's little helper?

07:12.331 --> 07:15.266
Something like that. Anyway,
I bring you presents, all of you.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.027
- Merry Christmas.
- Oh, thank you, Dylan.

07:17.203 --> 07:19.103
Could you give this to Iris
when you get to Maui?

07:19.272 --> 07:21.536
I'd be happy to.
I can't wait to see her.

07:21.707 --> 07:23.766
So where are you gonna spend
the holidays, son?

07:23.943 --> 07:25.274
Oh, thanks, bro.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.208
I'm going to Baja.

07:27.380 --> 07:29.371
Baja California.

07:29.549 --> 07:31.414
Favorite recreation spot
of Brenda Walsh.

07:31.584 --> 07:32.949
Thank you.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.552
Dylan, sit down
and join us, please,

07:34.720 --> 07:38.417
as we take another long trip
down memory lane.

07:38.591 --> 07:40.388
Let's not and say we did.

07:41.194 --> 07:43.685
There you go.
Merry Christmas, everybody.

07:44.564 --> 07:46.828
I bid you adieu, have a great trip
and I'll see you later.

07:46.999 --> 07:48.762
Oh, won't you sit down
and eat with us?

07:48.935 --> 07:50.527
No, I can't. I got one more stop
to make.

07:50.703 --> 07:52.466
But you know what, Cind,
do yourself a favor.

07:52.638 --> 07:54.162
When you get to Maui,
it's so beautiful,

07:54.340 --> 07:56.274
you're gonna sit there,
look out over the volcano,

07:56.442 --> 07:58.808
catch one of those sunrises.
You know what I'm saying?

07:58.978 --> 08:01.742
- See you.
- Bye.

08:02.215 --> 08:04.445
I didn't know Dylan
was such a fool for Christmas.

08:04.617 --> 08:06.585
Yeah, me either.

08:10.523 --> 08:12.150
Now, this one my mom bought

08:12.325 --> 08:15.692
in this little, tiny shop
right outside of Carmel.

08:15.862 --> 08:18.387
It's the first one
from my collection.

08:19.765 --> 08:22.825
Now, these two,
they're my favorites.

08:23.002 --> 08:24.060
They're from Belgium

08:24.237 --> 08:26.569
and I always hang them
right at the top of the tree

08:26.739 --> 08:28.900
so they could see
the whole world.

08:29.575 --> 08:32.476
Dylan, what are you doing here?
I thought you'd be in Baja by now.

08:32.645 --> 08:34.613
Well, you two are my last stop.

08:34.780 --> 08:37.977
Oh, don't look now but you're
standing under the mistletoe.

08:39.184 --> 08:41.847
Well, signed, sealed, delivered.
I'm here, I'm yours.

08:42.989 --> 08:44.980
Go for it, Donna.

08:47.593 --> 08:50.721
Donna, Merry Christmas.

08:50.897 --> 08:52.592
Oh, thank you.

08:52.765 --> 08:56.565
And Donna, happy birthday.

08:56.736 --> 08:57.964
Oh, you...

08:58.137 --> 08:59.866
Yeah.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.845
Okay, that's good, guys. Hi.

09:07.013 --> 09:08.674
Hey, little lady,
don't you worry about it.

09:08.848 --> 09:11.009
I got a sack full of gifts for you
right here

09:11.183 --> 09:12.810
and one for your little sister.

09:12.985 --> 09:15.886
That's so sweet. Erin's out of town
with Jackie until New Year's.

09:16.055 --> 09:17.955
But I'll give it to her
as soon as she gets back.

09:18.124 --> 09:21.491
I'll be back for New Year's Eve
so you don't make any plans.

09:21.661 --> 09:23.788
I wouldn't think of it.

09:27.266 --> 09:28.733
Hey, what's up, Dylan?

09:29.302 --> 09:32.931
Silverado, brother, you look like
a man on a mission.

09:33.105 --> 09:35.938
Yeah, well, my dad's having
some friends over tonight

09:36.108 --> 09:37.973
so this is what I'm wearing.

09:38.444 --> 09:40.071
Hey, you look really nice.

09:40.246 --> 09:41.941
- Yeah, you do.
- Thanks.

09:42.114 --> 09:44.014
Listen, I'll be back
in a couple hours.

09:44.183 --> 09:46.117
Well, we'll be here.

09:46.886 --> 09:49.616
Great. Take care of yourself.

09:49.789 --> 09:51.051
Take it easy.

09:55.995 --> 09:57.690
What's wrong with him?

09:57.863 --> 09:59.387
Nothing, he's okay.

09:59.565 --> 10:02.966
It's just the whole custody fight.
Been kind of brutal on him.

10:03.869 --> 10:06.394
But, you know,
Kelly here could be a big girl,

10:06.572 --> 10:08.233
and bury the ax for one evening.

10:08.407 --> 10:11.899
Donna, if I go to Mel's, Jackie's
gonna think that I'm on his side.

10:12.078 --> 10:14.205
- Kelly.
- It's a question of loyalty.

10:14.380 --> 10:15.904
And I can't do it.

10:16.082 --> 10:18.812
But you could if you wanted to.

10:19.452 --> 10:20.476
Help.

10:20.653 --> 10:22.177
Hey, give credit
where credit is due.

10:22.355 --> 10:24.414
Donna is the master manipulator.

10:24.590 --> 10:26.353
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

10:26.525 --> 10:27.958
Oh, I would.

10:28.127 --> 10:30.357
- Sorry, guys, you're on your own.
- Traitor.

10:30.529 --> 10:31.860
Well, ladies, I hate to do it,

10:32.031 --> 10:34.192
but I'm gonna have
to be saying adios for now.

10:34.367 --> 10:38.030
However, I'm under
the mistletoe again, so...

10:40.172 --> 10:42.402
Oh, what a shot, Kel.

10:42.575 --> 10:44.475
- Take it easy, Donna.
- Thank you.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.010
- Have fun.
- But not too much fun.

10:47.179 --> 10:48.646
Hey.

10:52.251 --> 10:53.513
Since you two got back together,

10:53.686 --> 10:55.586
he has been
a completely different person.

10:55.755 --> 10:58.349
I mean, I've never seen him
so upbeat and Christmas-y.

10:58.858 --> 11:00.189
Yeah, I don't know.

11:00.359 --> 11:03.055
Professor Waigner says that
a lot of people use the holidays

11:03.229 --> 11:05.060
to hide how lonely they really are.

11:05.564 --> 11:07.361
God knows Dylan has enough
bad memories

11:07.533 --> 11:08.727
about this time of year.

11:08.901 --> 11:11.699
You know, Kel,
and I don't mean this as criticism,

11:11.871 --> 11:13.930
those psychology classes
you've been taking?

11:14.106 --> 11:16.574
I think you've been taking them
a little too seriously.

11:17.410 --> 11:19.401
I hope you're right.

11:48.174 --> 11:49.937
Thanks for coming.

11:53.813 --> 11:55.337
I never expected to see you here.

11:56.849 --> 11:58.146
Why?

11:58.918 --> 12:01.910
Well, because I just figured that...

12:02.088 --> 12:04.818
That you kind of hated me
right about now.

12:04.990 --> 12:06.548
No.

12:09.962 --> 12:13.523
No, I don't hate you, Dad.

12:13.699 --> 12:15.530
But when I think
about all the Christmases

12:15.701 --> 12:19.137
that I spent alone with the maid
while you were off in the Bahamas,

12:19.305 --> 12:23.435
or skiing, or somewhere
with one of your girlfriends,

12:25.511 --> 12:27.001
I guess I finally wanted you to know

12:27.179 --> 12:29.079
what it was like
to be lonely at Christmas.

12:30.483 --> 12:32.474
Then I remembered
how much it hurt.

12:32.651 --> 12:35.848
As much as I wanted to,

12:36.756 --> 12:39.350
I just couldn't leave you hanging
on Christmas Eve.

12:39.525 --> 12:41.049
Yeah.

12:42.027 --> 12:44.393
Well, you know something,
son, I...

12:44.563 --> 12:47.657
You know, sometimes, I think
of this place as like a monastery,

12:48.801 --> 12:50.735
and I'm this monk.

12:51.403 --> 12:54.839
Because all I do
is think about you, Dylan.

12:55.007 --> 12:58.238
And what a strong son I have

12:58.410 --> 13:02.870
who's out there in the world
all alone, just like I was.

13:05.117 --> 13:06.345
Dad!

13:06.519 --> 13:08.316
Jack!

13:19.465 --> 13:22.901
Hi, are you Dylan McKay?

13:23.435 --> 13:25.369
I don't know, who's asking?

13:25.538 --> 13:27.233
Well, I'm an old friend
of your father's.

13:27.406 --> 13:30.671
He said that if I was ever in town,
I should look you up.

13:30.843 --> 13:32.174
He's dead.

13:33.679 --> 13:35.476
I'm sorry.

13:36.849 --> 13:38.817
We've caught you
at a bad time, haven't we?

13:38.984 --> 13:41.748
Sort of, yeah, I need
to get out of here right now.

13:41.921 --> 13:43.684
Well, we won't bother you, then.

13:43.856 --> 13:45.619
But would you happen to know
of a decent motel

13:45.791 --> 13:47.554
anywhere near the bus station?

13:52.765 --> 13:55.757
I don't really know
that part of town very well.

13:56.302 --> 13:57.633
I'm sorry.

13:58.537 --> 14:00.698
Do you want to use my phone?

14:00.873 --> 14:02.500
Are you sure
it isn't too much trouble?

14:03.108 --> 14:05.440
Come on in, it's fine.

14:07.112 --> 14:09.546
I'm Suzanne Steele,
this is my daughter, Erica.

14:09.715 --> 14:11.080
Hi.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.151
Can I get you anything to drink?

14:13.319 --> 14:15.480
Would you like coffee,
water, soda?

14:15.654 --> 14:17.622
Coffee would be great.

14:17.790 --> 14:20.224
- Anything you have will be fine.
- Okay.

14:20.392 --> 14:22.883
There's a phone book
in the table right there.

14:26.665 --> 14:30.032
Mom, I don't feel right
about being here.

14:30.202 --> 14:33.171
Oh, honey, we've come this far.
We can't back out now.

14:33.739 --> 14:36.003
Listen, just do exactly
what we talked about on the bus.

14:36.175 --> 14:38.040
We'll get through this, I promise.

14:38.577 --> 14:41.944
- Cream and sugar?
- That will be fine.

14:54.193 --> 14:56.024
I'll get it.

14:56.195 --> 14:58.254
- Is that the shuttle?
- No, it's King Kamehameha.

14:58.430 --> 15:00.022
- Of course, it's the shuttle.
- Oh, God.

15:00.199 --> 15:01.962
- Do you have the tickets?
- Right here.

15:02.134 --> 15:04.728
Well, Kaanapali Beach,
here we come.

15:07.172 --> 15:08.537
Hi, I was just in the neighborhood,

15:08.707 --> 15:10.732
I thought I'd drop by
and see how you're all doing.

15:10.910 --> 15:13.344
We'll be doing a lot better
if we can finally get to the airport.

15:13.512 --> 15:15.673
Oh, that's right. You're supposed
to be going to Hawaii.

15:15.848 --> 15:17.975
And I think our van
has just pulled up.

15:18.150 --> 15:20.482
Yup, I'll get the bags.

15:20.653 --> 15:23.554
Brandon, before you do that,
can I just talk to you real quick?

15:23.722 --> 15:26.054
- Sure, come on.
- Thanks.

15:26.225 --> 15:29.092
So, what's up?

15:29.261 --> 15:33.061
I was hoping you could give me
some ecumenical advice.

15:34.233 --> 15:36.724
Jesse invited me to go
with his family to midnight Mass

15:36.902 --> 15:38.267
which I'm sure,
will be fascinating.

15:38.437 --> 15:41.338
But the truth is I have never
stepped foot inside of a church,

15:41.507 --> 15:43.839
let alone on Christmas Eve.

15:44.009 --> 15:46.910
So I was hoping that you could
tell me exactly what takes place

15:47.079 --> 15:48.512
at a midnight Mass
on Christmas Eve

15:48.681 --> 15:49.807
in a Catholic church.

15:49.982 --> 15:53.076
I don't know, you could call
the Vatican hotline and ask them.

15:54.320 --> 15:56.811
- Oh, you're a lot of help.
- I'm also a Presbyterian.

15:56.989 --> 15:59.184
I've never been inside
a Catholic church either.

15:59.358 --> 16:01.155
But I'm sure
it'll be very interesting.

16:02.194 --> 16:04.355
You don't happen to have
the number

16:04.530 --> 16:06.361
for the Vatican hotline, do you?

16:06.899 --> 16:08.366
Merry Christmas, chief.

16:09.001 --> 16:10.901
Happy Hanukkah.

16:21.880 --> 16:23.370
<i>- Want some more orange juice?
- Help!</i>

16:23.549 --> 16:26.279
<i>Help!</i>

16:28.887 --> 16:30.411
<i>Help!</i>

16:34.426 --> 16:35.984
Well, we better be going

16:36.161 --> 16:38.254
or you're never gonna get down
to Mexico.

16:38.430 --> 16:39.988
That's the funny thing
about Mexico.

16:40.165 --> 16:43.259
It's been there awhile,
it will probably be there tomorrow.

16:45.304 --> 16:48.740
You know, I can't get over
how much you look like your father.

16:48.907 --> 16:51.000
From the way you say that,
you must've known him well.

16:51.176 --> 16:52.905
Well, it was a long time ago.

16:54.513 --> 16:57.073
He liked to take me
on business trips.

16:57.249 --> 17:00.685
I see, sort of like
a traveling companion.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.411
And from a sassy kid
right off the farm,

17:02.588 --> 17:08.288
it was quite a thrill seeing places
like Hong Kong, Jamaica...

17:08.861 --> 17:10.556
Your father meant a lot to me.

17:10.729 --> 17:11.991
Well, I can see why.

17:12.164 --> 17:13.926
You were obviously
well taken care of.

17:14.098 --> 17:17.296
And I know he liked to light
your cigarettes, that kind of thing.

17:17.469 --> 17:18.800
Please, don't be offended by that.

17:18.971 --> 17:20.962
It's just that Jack's been dead
for over a year now,

17:21.140 --> 17:22.436
and that seems an awful long time

17:22.608 --> 17:24.040
for someone to pay
their condolences.

17:24.209 --> 17:25.300
I wanted to get in touch with you

17:25.477 --> 17:27.001
the moment I heard
about Jack's death.

17:27.179 --> 17:32.879
But the truth is,
I just didn't know what to say.

17:33.919 --> 17:35.784
And then it started to rain...

17:35.954 --> 17:39.219
I realize how distracting
the pitter-patter of raindrops can be.

17:41.460 --> 17:45.157
If you lived on the banks
of the Mississippi like we did,

17:45.330 --> 17:48.322
and lost everything you had
in the world in the flood like we did,

17:48.500 --> 17:51.594
I seriously doubt you'd be
making jokes about the rain.

17:53.205 --> 17:54.638
You know, the only reason
I bothered

17:54.807 --> 17:56.866
to get in touch with you
in the first place was...

17:57.042 --> 17:59.772
I promised my daughter I'd take her
to Disneyland for a couple of days

17:59.945 --> 18:02.743
to help her forget that she's been
living in a Red Cross shelter

18:02.915 --> 18:04.576
for the last six months.

18:04.750 --> 18:05.944
Thanks so much for the coffee.

18:06.118 --> 18:09.952
We don't wanna put you out
any longer than we already have.

18:12.558 --> 18:13.582
Let her sleep.

18:15.694 --> 18:17.594
I'll get you a blanket.

18:30.442 --> 18:32.137
Oh, thank you.

18:32.311 --> 18:34.438
Yes, you know
you're traveling in first class

18:34.613 --> 18:36.171
when they bring you
your macadamia nuts

18:36.348 --> 18:38.646
before you even take off.

18:38.817 --> 18:40.682
You know, I could ask
the flight attendant

18:40.853 --> 18:42.878
to bring you a bottle of Xanax.

18:43.055 --> 18:46.024
Brandon, it's gonna be a very long
flight unless you stop teasing me.

18:47.526 --> 18:50.120
I just never knew you had
a phobia about flying, that's all.

18:50.295 --> 18:52.354
- I'm your brother...
- Bran, I do not have a phobia.

18:52.531 --> 18:55.989
I just don't like taking off
or landing.

18:56.168 --> 18:57.658
That's a phobia.

19:00.539 --> 19:02.700
I like this.

19:02.875 --> 19:05.343
I think your mother's finally
learned to enjoy the good life.

19:05.511 --> 19:07.775
I've always been able
to enjoy the good life.

19:07.946 --> 19:09.413
I just never have felt comfortable

19:09.581 --> 19:11.640
in the role of the Beverly Hills
society matron.

19:12.518 --> 19:14.281
Except that time that you came
to the boutique

19:14.453 --> 19:16.114
dressed up like Zsa Zsa Gabor.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.388
I don't think I know about this.

19:18.557 --> 19:21.390
- It was Mom's finest hour.
- Well, what happened?

19:21.560 --> 19:23.824
Well, basically, when Brenda
was working at that boutique,

19:23.996 --> 19:26.556
her boss was ripping off
her commissions.

19:26.732 --> 19:28.131
<i>And treating me like dirt.</i>

19:28.667 --> 19:30.066
<i>So we decided to teach her
a lesson.</i>

19:30.235 --> 19:32.328
No, I mean, it isn't you.

19:32.504 --> 19:36.770
And I'm wondering
if I need all those blouses.

19:36.942 --> 19:39.433
I don't know, you just have
such good taste.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.079
Why don't you leave there
whatever you don't want

19:42.247 --> 19:44.545
and I'll have the girl
put them away for you?

19:45.150 --> 19:49.280
And I really don't need
the scarves or the shoes.

19:49.955 --> 19:53.254
- You don't?
- No, I don't.

19:54.593 --> 19:57.118
No scarves, no shoes,
no hundred-dollar wrinkle creams.

19:57.296 --> 20:00.094
And I really don't need you telling me
how much you love my good taste,

20:00.265 --> 20:02.756
or how happy this will make me,
or how great I'll look,

20:02.935 --> 20:05.460
or how much I deserve this,
or how much I deserve that.

20:05.637 --> 20:08.367
And most of all, I really
don't need you kissing my butt

20:08.540 --> 20:09.598
to pad your commission

20:09.775 --> 20:11.675
while you treat
your employees badly.

20:15.747 --> 20:16.907
Isn't that a great story?

20:17.082 --> 20:21.212
Yup, it was so good you didn't
even notice we took off.

20:21.653 --> 20:24.645
- No way.
- Hey, look, I think that's our house.

20:24.823 --> 20:27.121
Just kidding, sit down.

20:47.212 --> 20:48.509
Yoo-hoo.

20:49.648 --> 20:50.910
Donna.

20:51.083 --> 20:54.985
Face it, there is no way out.
You are trapped.

20:56.855 --> 20:58.516
Yeah, I guess I am.

20:58.690 --> 21:00.658
Merry Christmas.

21:02.928 --> 21:04.418
Let's go.

21:05.731 --> 21:07.961
These candies are good.
Want some?

21:08.133 --> 21:10.567
You unwrapped all
of Dylan's presents?

21:10.736 --> 21:12.226
No, just this one.

21:12.404 --> 21:14.429
I was hungry.

21:14.606 --> 21:18.406
Well, I bet there'll be lots
of yummies at Mel's party.

21:20.746 --> 21:22.543
Are you sure
you don't wanna come with us?

21:22.714 --> 21:24.978
Donna, would you give it
a rest already?

21:28.720 --> 21:31.120
What was your professor saying
about people being depressed

21:31.290 --> 21:34.088
during the holidays? Jeez.

21:41.099 --> 21:43.158
<i>Good idea, Ernie, a toast.</i>

21:43.335 --> 21:47.465
<i>To my big brother, Jordan,
the richest man in town.</i>

21:50.142 --> 21:51.769
Suzanne.

21:52.511 --> 21:53.773
Let her sleep.

22:02.754 --> 22:03.846
I feel very badly.

22:04.022 --> 22:05.421
I mean, first, we barge in on you,

22:05.590 --> 22:08.616
and now we're sabotaging
your travel plans.

22:08.794 --> 22:11.194
Don't worry about it.
It's not a problem.

22:11.363 --> 22:14.594
I'll get there eventually. But tonight,
I think you guys should stay here.

22:14.766 --> 22:16.358
Oh, no, we couldn't
put you out like that.

22:16.535 --> 22:18.594
No, of course you could.
It's not a problem at all.

22:18.770 --> 22:21.000
In a while, I'll go down
the canyon, get us some dinner...

22:21.173 --> 22:22.538
No, no, Dylan...

22:22.708 --> 22:24.972
Come on, you can't come to L.A.
And not have a megaburger,

22:25.143 --> 22:26.405
trust me.

22:28.413 --> 22:29.812
You're very generous.

22:29.981 --> 22:32.279
Well, you know what they say.
Like father, like son.

22:32.451 --> 22:34.476
Must be kind of a family thing.

22:34.653 --> 22:36.814
Sort of like mother, like daughter.

22:36.988 --> 22:38.785
You've got a beautiful kid there.

22:40.759 --> 22:42.954
I don't know where I'd be
without her.

22:44.029 --> 22:45.462
Suzanne, let me
ask you something,

22:45.630 --> 22:49.566
and I don't mean to pry,
but what about Erica's father?

22:49.735 --> 22:51.828
Did he just leave you hanging
or what?

22:52.003 --> 22:54.494
Well, you could say that.

22:54.673 --> 22:56.140
He died last year.

22:57.275 --> 22:59.072
I'm so sorry.

23:01.546 --> 23:03.844
- Were they close?
- No.

23:04.015 --> 23:07.075
It's what the world needs,
another absentee father.

23:07.252 --> 23:09.720
I gotta tell you, I was gonna slam
the door right in your face.

23:09.888 --> 23:12.049
And I would have, but I looked
at that little girl

23:12.224 --> 23:15.318
and something special happened.

23:16.695 --> 23:18.526
Did I say something?

23:19.798 --> 23:21.959
Jack was her father, Dylan.

23:22.634 --> 23:24.101
What?

23:24.569 --> 23:28.403
Jack was her father.

23:29.508 --> 23:32.204
Erica is your sister.

23:44.623 --> 23:47.490
<i>We seem to be passing through
a little rough patch, folks.</i>

23:47.659 --> 23:49.286
<i>So if you're not moving
around the cabin,</i>

23:49.461 --> 23:50.951
<i>you might wanna stay buckled up.</i>

23:55.467 --> 23:57.059
Looking a little shaky there,
Island Man?

23:57.235 --> 24:00.204
I think I just ate
a few too many macadamia nuts.

24:00.372 --> 24:01.669
But thank you for your concern.

24:01.840 --> 24:04.536
Well, I have been reading
this brochure from the hotel.

24:05.143 --> 24:08.943
We can take a luxury
Watsu water treatment at the spa.

24:09.114 --> 24:10.877
But they do have one rule.

24:11.049 --> 24:12.880
Guests are not allowed to study
for finals

24:13.051 --> 24:14.484
while using the facilities, sorry.

24:14.653 --> 24:17.349
That's why I'm trying to get through
this book before we get there.

24:17.522 --> 24:20.685
Brandon, when exactly did you start
becoming so compulsive

24:20.859 --> 24:23.453
- about school?
- I am not compulsive.

24:23.628 --> 24:26.256
It's just after midterms,
I figured I had a good shot

24:26.431 --> 24:28.695
at getting straight A's
this semester, that's all.

24:28.867 --> 24:30.528
You sound like Andrea.

24:30.702 --> 24:32.795
What are you saying?
I've become too studious?

24:33.405 --> 24:34.838
No, not really.

24:35.006 --> 24:37.167
But you are saying
I've changed a lot.

24:37.342 --> 24:40.834
Brandon, I think all of us
have changed a lot this year.

24:42.180 --> 24:44.114
All except one.

24:45.917 --> 24:47.441
Nat, why is it every Christmas

24:47.619 --> 24:50.213
there's always something major
going on in my life?

24:50.388 --> 24:52.288
Two years ago, I ran away
on a bus to New Mexico

24:52.457 --> 24:54.186
to try and find my birth mother.

24:54.359 --> 24:55.826
Turns out, she's dead.

24:55.994 --> 24:58.986
Last year, I break into the school
trying to change my grades,

24:59.164 --> 25:00.563
I almost get expelled.

25:00.732 --> 25:03.326
Are you telling me you're in
the same kind of hot water again?

25:03.502 --> 25:04.560
It ain't pretty, Nat.

25:04.736 --> 25:07.500
I got busted breaking
into a professor's office.

25:07.672 --> 25:09.230
Oh, Steve.

25:09.407 --> 25:12.604
It was a fraternity prank.
Come on, it's all part of hazing.

25:12.777 --> 25:15.109
Fortunately, the professor's
gonna step up to the plate

25:15.280 --> 25:16.872
and the school's
not gonna press charges.

25:17.048 --> 25:18.913
Oh, so, what's the problem?

25:19.518 --> 25:22.009
I think one of my fraternity brothers
set me up.

25:22.187 --> 25:23.950
So find a new fraternity.

25:24.789 --> 25:27.485
My father was a KEG president.

25:27.659 --> 25:29.684
If I disown them, he'll disown me.

25:31.296 --> 25:35.164
Well, you just have
to come clean with your dad.

25:36.034 --> 25:37.058
Thanks, Nat.

25:37.235 --> 25:39.931
I was hoping for something
a little more illuminating from you.

25:41.907 --> 25:43.204
Merry Christmas.

26:08.066 --> 26:10.057
<i>I say we just pick up
where we left off.</i>

26:11.336 --> 26:13.930
No, David, I don't think so.

26:15.574 --> 26:16.836
Donna, let me spend the night.

26:17.008 --> 26:19.135
How often are both your parents
out of town?

26:19.311 --> 26:20.403
No.

26:21.880 --> 26:24.678
Oh, it's too soon,
I can see that.

26:24.849 --> 26:29.684
No, I'm not gonna do that
with anybody.

26:30.722 --> 26:32.189
You mean, ever?

26:32.757 --> 26:34.486
<i>Want some eggnog?</i>

26:35.794 --> 26:38.092
No, thanks, I'm fine.

26:38.263 --> 26:40.390
Get real, David, you're not fine.

26:40.565 --> 26:41.964
I can see it in your face

26:42.133 --> 26:44.795
and it really hurts me
to see you like this.

26:44.970 --> 26:46.699
Dad, I'm doing the best I can.

26:46.871 --> 26:50.705
I know you are, David,
but it's Christmas Eve.

26:50.875 --> 26:53.537
You gotta put this custody business
with Jackie out of your mind.

26:53.712 --> 26:55.202
Believe me,
the last thing on my mind

26:55.380 --> 26:56.642
is your marital problems.

26:57.349 --> 27:00.113
You have gotta try these
pizza rolls, they're dee-lish.

27:00.285 --> 27:02.048
No, thanks.

27:03.221 --> 27:05.189
It's your exchange.

27:05.357 --> 27:09.987
Great. Every holiday, never fails.

27:10.562 --> 27:12.154
Hello, this is Dr. Silver.

27:12.330 --> 27:14.298
Oh, Mel, look, I'm sorry
to bother you

27:14.466 --> 27:16.331
but I didn't know who else to call.

27:16.501 --> 27:17.559
Kel, what's wrong?

27:17.736 --> 27:20.364
I cracked my tooth open
eating a hard piece of candy

27:20.538 --> 27:22.369
and my mouth is throbbing.

27:22.540 --> 27:25.168
<i>Look, I know it's Christmas Eve</i>

27:25.343 --> 27:27.470
but do you know of a pharmacy
or something

27:27.646 --> 27:29.045
I can get a prescription?

27:29.614 --> 27:31.605
Yeah, sure, get a pen
and some paper

27:31.783 --> 27:33.910
and I'll tell you what to do.

27:50.669 --> 27:51.693
Hey, Nat.

27:51.870 --> 27:54.134
Hey, what are you doing here?
I thought you were in Baja.

27:54.305 --> 27:56.205
Oh, to tell you the truth, Nat,
I wish I was.

27:56.374 --> 27:58.968
Yeah, well, your loss is our gain.

27:59.144 --> 28:01.408
Roll up your sleeves and give us
a hand getting this stuff

28:01.579 --> 28:02.637
ready for tomorrow.

28:02.814 --> 28:04.042
I can't, Nat.

28:04.215 --> 28:05.807
Oh, come on, Dylan.

28:05.984 --> 28:08.612
You're always saying how much
you wanna help the homeless.

28:08.787 --> 28:11.221
Now I'm giving you a chance,
and you're flaking out on me.

28:11.456 --> 28:14.550
Listen, I already tried to help
two lost souls today, okay?

28:14.726 --> 28:16.091
I don't know
if they're scamming me.

28:16.261 --> 28:18.354
But this woman shows up
on my doorstep,

28:18.530 --> 28:21.465
claims she's the mother of
Jack McKay's long-lost daughter.

28:21.633 --> 28:23.123
- What?
- Yeah.

28:23.301 --> 28:24.893
I told them I'd get them
something to eat.

28:25.070 --> 28:26.799
Will you fix me some
of this stuff up quick?

28:26.971 --> 28:27.995
Yeah, sure.

28:28.173 --> 28:30.767
Now I know what people mean
by fruitcakes at Christmas.

28:31.276 --> 28:34.643
She's hustling me. I can feel it.

28:35.113 --> 28:39.277
Dylan, I don't know
what's going on with this woman.

28:39.451 --> 28:41.043
But if there's ever one night
of the year

28:41.219 --> 28:42.311
that you can give a stranger

28:42.487 --> 28:46.548
a benefit of the doubt,
this has gotta be it.

29:04.008 --> 29:05.908
Just a minute.

29:08.713 --> 29:10.203
Merry Christmas.

29:13.585 --> 29:15.416
It's too much, isn't it?

29:16.020 --> 29:19.615
- Well...
- It's okay, come on in, I'm sorry.

29:20.158 --> 29:21.682
You see, it's just that
in synagogue,

29:21.860 --> 29:24.761
we're supposed to cover
our heads during services.

29:24.929 --> 29:27.898
We wear bonnets too,
mostly at Easter.

29:29.501 --> 29:31.492
I forgot.

29:31.669 --> 29:33.500
What about the gloves?

29:33.671 --> 29:35.332
What about them?

29:35.507 --> 29:37.805
Should I take them off?

29:38.343 --> 29:40.368
Oh, only while taking communion.

29:40.545 --> 29:42.513
- Communion?
- Oh, sure.

29:42.680 --> 29:44.910
Sure, first, the priest
is gonna take your confession,

29:45.083 --> 29:47.643
then you'll decide to become a nun,
you'll move to a third world...

29:47.819 --> 29:49.980
Okay, all right.
Okay, I'm being an idiot.

29:50.155 --> 29:55.058
No, I understand. You've never
been to midnight Mass before.

29:55.226 --> 29:57.285
- You don't know what to expect.
- Exactly.

29:57.462 --> 30:00.590
I mean, it's not like
I'm being prejudiced, it's just...

30:00.765 --> 30:03.165
Well, there is no Baby Jesus
in Judaism.

30:04.302 --> 30:06.736
Well, as a former altar boy,

30:06.905 --> 30:10.671
my advice is not to dwell
on the religious nature of the service.

30:10.842 --> 30:12.833
But try to focus
on the distinct possibility

30:13.011 --> 30:17.846
that for one, brief,
shining moment,

30:18.616 --> 30:21.779
there actually could be peace
on Earth and goodwill to man.

30:23.388 --> 30:24.685
I love you.

30:25.523 --> 30:27.457
I love you too.

30:34.032 --> 30:35.829
I don't know
why I get so wound up.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.831
- Oh, I do.
- Why?

30:38.002 --> 30:39.663
My whole family's gonna be there.

30:41.940 --> 30:43.771
I forgot.

30:50.281 --> 30:51.305
Okay.

30:52.250 --> 30:54.241
- That's it?
- For now.

30:54.419 --> 30:57.616
In about two weeks, we'll fit you
with a permanent crown.

30:58.056 --> 31:00.684
So does this mean
I have bad teeth?

31:00.859 --> 31:03.327
No, it means you have
bad eating habits.

31:04.162 --> 31:06.687
I sound just like your mom,
don't I?

31:08.466 --> 31:10.195
Now, she has good teeth.

31:10.368 --> 31:12.063
Your mom.

31:12.237 --> 31:13.499
With everything that's going on,

31:13.671 --> 31:15.605
for you to leave your own party
on Christmas Eve

31:15.773 --> 31:16.797
has to be the nicest...

31:16.975 --> 31:19.170
Kel, I may have been
a lousy husband,

31:19.344 --> 31:22.142
but I'm a very good dentist.

31:22.313 --> 31:25.874
And when all is said and done,
I'm not a bad father either.

31:26.551 --> 31:29.418
Mel, I really tried to talk her out
of bringing this lawsuit against you,

31:29.587 --> 31:33.318
- I did, but...
- It's okay.

31:33.491 --> 31:35.220
I'm not angry at you.

31:35.393 --> 31:38.157
I'm not even angry at her anymore.

31:38.329 --> 31:42.356
I save my contempt
for her lawyer and for me.

31:43.601 --> 31:47.731
Kel, if I could turn back
the clock and start over, I would.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.533
But I can't.

31:49.707 --> 31:52.369
And she'll never forgive me for it.

31:53.878 --> 31:56.745
She even got a new dentist.

31:57.582 --> 31:59.106
I do miss you, Mel.

32:03.821 --> 32:05.948
Not too tight.

32:06.124 --> 32:07.648
Be careful.

32:11.162 --> 32:13.187
Oh, honey, did you want
a blanket?

32:13.364 --> 32:15.161
No, thanks.

32:15.767 --> 32:17.792
I think I'm gonna stay up
and watch the movie.

32:17.969 --> 32:20.733
Well, wake me when we get there.

32:21.906 --> 32:25.000
- Dad, do you want a cappuccino?
- No, thanks, hon.

32:25.176 --> 32:28.270
- Brandon?
- I'll take an Irish coffee, please.

32:28.880 --> 32:30.438
That, you're gonna have
to get yourself.

32:30.615 --> 32:32.810
Okay, I'll have a cappuccino.

32:33.518 --> 32:35.383
Okay.

32:35.553 --> 32:37.384
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is going to sound</i>

32:37.555 --> 32:38.613
<i>a lot worse than it is,</i>

32:38.790 --> 32:41.122
<i>but the computer that controls
our landing gear</i>

32:41.292 --> 32:42.589
<i>has gone down on us.</i>

32:42.760 --> 32:45.854
<i>And while we believe that
our equipment is still operational,</i>

32:46.030 --> 32:48.931
<i>to ensure your safety
and for the safety of the aircraft,</i>

32:49.100 --> 32:52.297
<i>we've made the decision
to return to Los Angeles.</i>

32:52.470 --> 32:54.995
<i>We're sorry for the inconvenience
to your travel plans.</i>

32:55.173 --> 32:59.269
<i>But, please, rest assured we have
the situation under control.</i>

32:59.444 --> 33:00.934
If they have
everything under control,

33:01.112 --> 33:03.444
how come we're going back
to L. A?

33:14.993 --> 33:18.326
- How's your mouth?
- Oh, it's okay, it's a little sore.

33:18.496 --> 33:19.895
Did Mel make it back to the party?

33:20.064 --> 33:23.033
He sure did and he said
you were an excellent patient.

33:23.935 --> 33:25.562
Why didn't you and David stay?

33:26.270 --> 33:28.204
Well, David's still back
at the condo.

33:28.373 --> 33:30.238
What happened?
Did you guys have a fight?

33:30.408 --> 33:32.569
No, no, it's nothing like that.

33:32.744 --> 33:36.305
He just needed some
one-on-one time with his father.

33:36.481 --> 33:38.949
And I understand
what he's going through.

33:39.117 --> 33:42.245
But he did say he would meet us
at the Peach Pit tomorrow.

33:43.855 --> 33:45.550
So let's open our presents, okay?

33:45.723 --> 33:47.350
Okay.

33:47.525 --> 33:48.924
Merry Christmas, Donna.

33:49.093 --> 33:51.061
Merry Christmas, Kel.

33:54.532 --> 33:56.591
<i>May I have your attention, please?</i>

33:56.768 --> 33:59.464
<i>We're releasing the remainder
of our fuel over the ocean</i>

33:59.637 --> 34:02.299
<i>in case we have to make
a landing without wheels.</i>

34:02.473 --> 34:04.304
<i>This is normal procedure.</i>

34:04.475 --> 34:06.966
<i>Our flight crew will review
the evacuation procedures,</i>

34:07.145 --> 34:08.373
<i>should the need arise.</i>

34:15.920 --> 34:18.480
- Mom?
- Hi, honey.

34:19.090 --> 34:20.614
I fell asleep.

34:20.792 --> 34:22.123
You were tired.

34:23.027 --> 34:24.051
What time is it?

34:24.228 --> 34:27.025
- It's late, why don't you just...?
- Did you tell Dylan about us?

34:29.132 --> 34:32.034
Oh, no, Erica, Erica...

34:32.536 --> 34:36.837
Dylan, this is for you.

34:39.342 --> 34:42.277
Let me wipe the grease
off my hands.

34:44.181 --> 34:45.308
It would have been better,

34:45.483 --> 34:47.746
but I made it
while we were on the bus.

34:47.918 --> 34:51.150
Well, I'll take that
into consideration.

34:51.755 --> 34:53.656
I hope you like it.

34:55.560 --> 34:56.993
Do you like it?

35:02.066 --> 35:05.661
<i>Sweetly singing o'er the plains</i>

35:05.837 --> 35:09.603
<i>And the mountains in reply</i>

35:09.774 --> 35:13.141
<i>Echo back their joyous strains</i>

35:13.311 --> 35:20.217
<i>Gloria</i>

35:20.384 --> 35:23.751
<i>In excelsis deo</i>

35:23.921 --> 35:30.383
<i>Gloria</i>

35:30.561 --> 35:35.589
<i>In excelsis deo</i>

35:35.766 --> 35:38.860
<i>Angels we have heard on high</i>

35:39.036 --> 35:42.369
<i>Sweetly singing o'er the plains</i>

35:42.540 --> 35:45.805
<i>And the mountains in reply</i>

35:45.977 --> 35:49.208
<i>Echo back their joyous strains</i>

35:49.380 --> 35:55.944
<i>Gloria</i>

35:56.120 --> 35:59.453
<i>In excelsis deo...</i>

36:06.964 --> 36:08.591
<i>If it's any solace to you all,</i>

36:08.766 --> 36:10.700
<i>I've been through this kind
of thing before.</i>

36:10.868 --> 36:14.099
<i>Chances are, we just have
a burned out bulb on our panel</i>

36:14.272 --> 36:16.103
<i>and everything is indeed normal.</i>

36:16.274 --> 36:18.037
He keeps saying that.

36:18.643 --> 36:19.701
Then it must be true.

36:19.877 --> 36:22.778
Yeah, everything's normal
except our landing gear is jammed.

36:23.681 --> 36:24.705
I don't buy it.

36:24.882 --> 36:26.543
What? You think they're faking it?

36:26.717 --> 36:30.585
No, it's just I'm not ready
to check out of here yet.

36:33.291 --> 36:35.191
We're gonna get through this.

36:35.359 --> 36:36.849
We're hanging, Mom.

36:37.895 --> 36:40.796
- I am really scared now.
- Hold on, honey.

36:40.965 --> 36:43.126
Think good thoughts.

36:43.301 --> 36:45.235
Only good thoughts.

36:54.979 --> 36:58.415
I bet they have emergency crews
lining the tarmac.

36:58.583 --> 37:01.245
Brandon, think
good thoughts, okay?

37:16.634 --> 37:18.465
Hold on.

37:42.593 --> 37:44.356
<i>- We are on the ground, folks.
- All right.</i>

37:44.528 --> 37:46.587
<i>- Welcome to Los Angeles.
- We made it.</i>

37:50.568 --> 37:52.160
Piece of cake.

37:59.677 --> 38:02.840
Let's see what we got
in the bag of goodies.

38:12.256 --> 38:13.723
Bye.

38:18.562 --> 38:21.554
A Raggedy Ann doll. You must
have been very good this year.

38:21.732 --> 38:23.495
Here you go.

38:24.535 --> 38:28.266
- Nat, where'd you get this guy?
- The North Pole.

38:28.773 --> 38:31.241
Are you guys ready
for some caroling?

38:32.276 --> 38:33.903
I'm gone.

38:34.679 --> 38:36.806
In temple, it is nothing like that.

38:36.981 --> 38:39.506
David, you've been ignoring her
all morning.

38:40.117 --> 38:41.641
Yeah, well, in case
you haven't noticed,

38:41.819 --> 38:43.252
I've been serving meals
all morning.

38:43.421 --> 38:45.616
You be nice.

38:45.790 --> 38:48.020
Look, I'm doing the best I can,
all right?

38:48.192 --> 38:49.955
All right.

38:50.895 --> 38:52.226
You know what else I loved?

38:52.396 --> 38:54.387
Most of the Mass
was done in Spanish,

38:54.565 --> 38:57.261
but at one point, the priest
started speaking in Latin.

38:57.435 --> 39:00.165
- Do they do that in your church?
- I think so.

39:00.338 --> 39:01.396
After hearing Latin spoken,

39:01.572 --> 39:04.200
I don't know how it ever became
a dead language.

39:06.077 --> 39:07.840
Donna, are you okay?

39:08.612 --> 39:10.705
Doing the best I can.

39:13.851 --> 39:15.819
Oh, here you go.

39:15.986 --> 39:18.648
Merry Christmas,
Merry Christmas, I say, I say.

39:18.823 --> 39:20.586
- Stevie.
- Brando.

39:20.758 --> 39:23.056
Oh, and Brenda
and Cindy and Jim.

39:23.227 --> 39:24.854
We come as a matched set,
you know?

39:25.029 --> 39:26.997
Hey, what did you guys do?
Miss your plane?

39:27.164 --> 39:30.361
- I wish.
- No, the plane had engine trouble.

39:30.534 --> 39:32.798
So it had to turn back,
and we landed in L.A.

39:32.970 --> 39:34.403
And rather than get
on another plane,

39:34.572 --> 39:36.597
we decided to spend Christmas
on the mainland.

39:38.008 --> 39:39.805
Well, you're just in time
for singing.

39:39.977 --> 39:41.069
Oh, yeah.

39:41.245 --> 39:44.146
- We should've rented a canoe.
- Oh, come on, Brando.

39:44.315 --> 39:46.783
You got a good set of pipes,
join us.

39:47.618 --> 39:48.812
- Hi, Andrea.
- Merry Christmas.

39:48.986 --> 39:50.010
- How are you?
- Good.

39:50.187 --> 39:51.484
- Hi.
- Hi, Don.

39:53.057 --> 39:54.081
- Hey.
- Hi.

39:54.258 --> 39:57.716
All right, everyone, if you can sing,
if you can remember the words...

40:01.132 --> 40:04.363
Sweetie, if we're gonna get
to Disneyland, we've gotta go.

40:04.535 --> 40:06.901
I can't believe Dylan would leave
without saying goodbye.

40:07.071 --> 40:08.902
Well, he probably wanted
to get an early start.

40:09.073 --> 40:10.301
It's a long way to Mexico.

40:11.475 --> 40:13.841
You should have wrote to him
and told him we were coming.

40:14.011 --> 40:15.672
I probably should have.

40:15.846 --> 40:17.313
But at least we got to meet him.

40:18.849 --> 40:20.908
Honey, we can't stay here.

40:21.085 --> 40:23.076
Yeah, let's go.

40:24.455 --> 40:25.513
Hey, look out, make way,

40:25.689 --> 40:28.852
the Christmas tree express
is coming through, express train.

40:32.263 --> 40:35.232
Oh, would you look at the size
of that monster?

40:35.399 --> 40:37.765
Is it big enough for you?
Do you like that?

40:37.935 --> 40:39.562
Tell you what, I got car
full of presents.

40:39.737 --> 40:42.535
I got lights, I got decorations,
I got flashing candy canes.

40:42.706 --> 40:46.005
And for the grand finale,
I got three tickets to Disneyland.

40:48.846 --> 40:50.973
I didn't think I was ever
gonna see you again.

40:51.148 --> 40:54.140
Are you kidding?
I never had a sister before.

41:06.697 --> 41:08.221
David, you're missing everything.

41:08.399 --> 41:09.764
I just wanna finish up.

41:09.934 --> 41:11.561
- Okay, let me help.
- Donna, Donna.

41:11.735 --> 41:13.396
Just go back with the others,
all right?

41:13.571 --> 41:15.004
I'll be done in a couple minutes.

41:15.372 --> 41:18.432
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

41:18.609 --> 41:21.442
David, don't shut me out.
You can talk to me.

41:24.215 --> 41:25.842
I can't...

41:26.016 --> 41:27.415
You can't what?

41:28.319 --> 41:32.415
Donna, I can't go on like this,
all right?

41:32.590 --> 41:35.354
Donna, I love you.

41:36.293 --> 41:38.284
You know, I don't even
wanna discuss this right now.

41:38.462 --> 41:40.987
It's your birthday, it's Christmas,
let's just go out and...

41:41.165 --> 41:42.757
No.

41:44.034 --> 41:45.797
What are you saying?

41:49.373 --> 41:53.639
It's our relationship, it's just
not working for me anymore.

41:55.246 --> 41:56.508
Especially the sex part.

41:56.680 --> 41:58.272
I'm sorry,
I wanted to wait until after...

41:58.449 --> 41:59.746
- Just get away from me.
- Donna...

41:59.917 --> 42:01.612
Please.
