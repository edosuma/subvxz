WEBVTT

00:00.515 --> 00:02.049
<i>Previously on:</i>

00:02.153 --> 00:05.070
I am determined to find someone
who wants to be with me

00:05.072 --> 00:06.989
for who I am,
not what I have.

00:06.991 --> 00:08.607
I need to buy a little
bit of everything.

00:08.609 --> 00:09.908
I can help you out with that.

00:09.910 --> 00:12.194
I appreciate it... Kate.

00:12.196 --> 00:15.748
Not a problem...
Sam Wilson.

00:15.750 --> 00:16.915
It's refreshing,

00:16.917 --> 00:19.501
talking to someone like you
for a change.

00:19.503 --> 00:20.586
Someone like me?

00:20.588 --> 00:22.571
Yeah, someone who's not
constantly trying

00:22.573 --> 00:24.456
to impress me
with how much stuff he's got.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.458
Kate, this is
my friend Alan.

00:26.460 --> 00:28.410
Thanks so much
for picking us up.

00:28.412 --> 00:29.962
Yeah, this clown
rents a room from me,

00:29.964 --> 00:31.630
suddenly I'm running
a taxi service.

00:31.632 --> 00:32.765
You should move out.

00:32.767 --> 00:33.966
Can't afford to.

00:33.968 --> 00:35.917
Maybe you could crash here.

00:35.919 --> 00:37.085
Have you really
thought this through?

00:37.087 --> 00:38.804
I've got to see where
this goes with Kate.

00:38.806 --> 00:40.939
Promise me one thing.
What's that?

00:40.941 --> 00:42.975
That we're always honest
with each other.

00:42.977 --> 00:44.777
You got it.

00:47.096 --> 00:48.280
Anyways, I hope that it's okay

00:48.282 --> 00:49.782
that I have people over
on Christmas.

00:49.784 --> 00:51.617
It's just Jake
and Lyndsey and my mom.

00:51.619 --> 00:52.868
Of course.
It's the holidays.

00:52.870 --> 00:54.419
It's the time to be
with the ones you love.

00:54.421 --> 00:56.405
Right. Uh, and my mom.

00:56.407 --> 01:01.109
So, uh, so listen, Sam Wilson,
how are things in Poorville?

01:01.111 --> 01:02.878
Are you <i>Les Misérables?</i>

01:02.880 --> 01:04.530
Actually, it's a hoot.

01:06.283 --> 01:08.250
You know,
last night

01:08.252 --> 01:10.385
Kate and I went shopping
at the 99 Cent Store.

01:10.387 --> 01:12.054
That place is amazing.

01:12.056 --> 01:14.923
Did you know that everything
there is 99 cents?

01:14.925 --> 01:18.343
Know it? I registered there
for my wedding.

01:18.345 --> 01:20.395
Two cans of peaches: 99 cents.

01:20.397 --> 01:22.631
Four-pack of yogurt: 99 cents.

01:22.633 --> 01:24.600
This owl-shaped mug?

01:24.602 --> 01:26.652
99 cents.

01:26.654 --> 01:28.604
Guess how much
the wine inside was?

01:28.606 --> 01:31.240
Uh, I'm going to go out
on a limb and say 99 cents?

01:31.242 --> 01:33.242
79 cents.

01:34.244 --> 01:35.861
Dented box.

01:35.863 --> 01:38.030
From now on, I'm buying
everything from that place.

01:38.032 --> 01:39.164
Uh, not condoms.

01:39.166 --> 01:41.250
I think that's how
I ended up with Jake.

01:41.252 --> 01:42.534
Hey.

01:42.536 --> 01:44.169
Hey, baby.

01:44.171 --> 01:45.337
Uh, I gotta go.

01:45.339 --> 01:46.672
Oh, hey, Katie.

01:46.674 --> 01:47.956
Alan.

01:47.958 --> 01:49.091
How are you?

01:49.093 --> 01:50.325
I'm fine-- just, uh...

01:50.327 --> 01:53.262
sipping some wine I got
at the 999 Dollar Store.

01:54.547 --> 01:56.831
Bye, Alan.

01:56.833 --> 01:58.550
Douche.

01:58.552 --> 01:59.935
Don't worry about him.

01:59.937 --> 02:01.186
How was your day?

02:01.188 --> 02:02.671
It's Christmas, Sam.

02:02.673 --> 02:05.524
Happy people wishing you
"Peace on Earth."

02:05.526 --> 02:07.476
It was horrible.

02:07.478 --> 02:09.561
Okay, somebody's got
a case of the Grinches.

02:09.562 --> 02:11.597
No, it's a case
of nine-hour shifts

02:11.599 --> 02:15.617
listening to Celine Dion
murder "O Holy Night."

02:15.619 --> 02:17.352
If I ever meet
that skinny bitch,

02:17.354 --> 02:20.656
I'm going to beat
the "O Holy" crap out of her.

02:20.658 --> 02:22.791
And that's what Christmas
is all about.

02:23.878 --> 02:25.043
I'm sorry.

02:25.045 --> 02:26.962
Tell me about your day.

02:26.964 --> 02:29.864
After you left,
I made some breakfast...

02:29.866 --> 02:31.500
Oh, I got the mail.

02:31.502 --> 02:34.219
And then I did some work on
that app I've been developing,

02:34.221 --> 02:37.673
and then I did some serious
research on World War II.

02:37.675 --> 02:38.557
Really?

02:38.559 --> 02:39.675
Well, I fell asleep

02:39.677 --> 02:41.059
watching the History Channel.

02:41.061 --> 02:42.844
Sweetie, can I be honest
with you?

02:42.846 --> 02:44.396
Yeah. What's up?

02:44.398 --> 02:47.182
I am working my ass off.

02:47.184 --> 02:49.651
It would be really,
really nice if you could,

02:49.653 --> 02:52.237
I don't know,
pitch in a little.

02:52.239 --> 02:55.774
You heard the part about me
getting the mail, right?

02:57.244 --> 03:00.329
You do understand that what came
in the mail is a pile of bills?

03:00.331 --> 03:01.246
Okay...

03:01.248 --> 03:02.714
I mean, I think
it is great

03:02.716 --> 03:04.583
that you're working on
your computer stuff,

03:04.585 --> 03:06.251
but we need help now.

03:06.253 --> 03:07.786
I get it.
Say no more.

03:07.788 --> 03:10.756
I'll start looking
for a job.

03:10.758 --> 03:11.873
Thank you.

03:11.875 --> 03:13.742
And don't worry,
it's not like

03:13.744 --> 03:15.093
I expect you to make
a million dollars or anything.

03:15.095 --> 03:17.512
Oh, thank God!

03:19.016 --> 03:21.433
Go ahead. I'm going
to go run a bath.

03:21.435 --> 03:24.970
I reek of comfort and joy.

03:26.522 --> 03:28.390
Hey, Billy. What's up?

03:28.392 --> 03:30.192
Nothing much--
just running our company

03:30.194 --> 03:32.060
while you take
some personal time.

03:32.062 --> 03:34.813
Why don't you just man up
and admit you're in rehab?

03:34.815 --> 03:36.398
I am not in rehab.

03:36.400 --> 03:38.951
I told you.
I'm on a spiritual journey.

03:38.953 --> 03:40.786
Spiritual journey.
Yeah, you know what?

03:40.788 --> 03:44.272
I've been on four of those.
I still wake up craving meth.

03:44.274 --> 03:46.325
I call it "Eat, Pray, Love,

03:46.327 --> 03:49.795
Have Angry Sex
with an Asian Hooker."

03:49.797 --> 03:50.879
What do you want, Billy?

03:50.881 --> 03:52.514
Well, I'm just keeping
you in the loop

03:52.516 --> 03:53.815
about what's
going on around here.

03:53.817 --> 03:55.300
We got new computers
in the bullpen.

03:55.302 --> 03:56.785
We got a staple-less stapler.

03:56.787 --> 03:58.253
Mark Zuckerberg offered to buy

03:58.255 --> 04:00.172
a controlling interest
in the company for 800 million,

04:00.174 --> 04:04.393
and the redhead in marketing
is not wearing bras.

04:04.395 --> 04:05.960
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

04:05.962 --> 04:09.297
There's a staple-less stapler?

04:09.299 --> 04:11.633
I think we should
take his offer.

04:11.635 --> 04:13.935
Billy, we built the Electric
Suitcase from the ground up.

04:13.937 --> 04:15.737
I mean, besides,
we've been here before.

04:15.739 --> 04:17.822
You hated the fact
that I sold our last company

04:17.825 --> 04:19.940
and I've come to realize
that you were right.

04:19.942 --> 04:22.294
I hated Tarnell, the gangsta
who sold me crack,

04:22.296 --> 04:24.279
but I was still happy
to work with him.

04:24.281 --> 04:26.665
I mean, look,
this is a good offer.

04:26.667 --> 04:27.749
We should take it.

04:27.751 --> 04:29.084
Okay.

04:29.086 --> 04:32.454
Tell him 1.2 billion,
but we keep control.

04:32.456 --> 04:34.489
Where do you think we're
going to get a better offer?

04:34.491 --> 04:36.625
Bath's ready.
Want to join me?

04:36.627 --> 04:39.428
I just got a better offer.
Good-bye.

05:18.504 --> 05:20.671
Where did you get money
to buy champagne?

05:20.673 --> 05:22.206
You left some for me.

05:22.208 --> 05:24.324
For emergencies.

05:24.326 --> 05:26.710
Yeah.
We were out of champagne.

05:27.879 --> 05:29.430
So, what are you doing here?

05:29.432 --> 05:31.799
What am I doing here
in my house?

05:31.801 --> 05:33.183
Uh, uh, I'm sorry.
Let me rephrase that.

05:33.185 --> 05:35.335
Uh, uh, great to see you.
What brings you by?

05:35.337 --> 05:37.104
I'm doing laundry
for Kate and me.

05:37.106 --> 05:38.806
Really?
You did laundry.

05:38.808 --> 05:41.558
No, I did laundry.

05:41.560 --> 05:42.943
Thank you.

05:42.945 --> 05:44.845
So, you're, like,
some sort of kept man, huh?

05:44.847 --> 05:46.480
Well, I'm supposed
to be out job hunting,

05:46.482 --> 05:47.614
but it's kind of hard

05:47.616 --> 05:49.683
since Sam Wilson
doesn't actually exist.

05:49.685 --> 05:51.518
I can help you there.

05:51.520 --> 05:53.854
Five grand will get you
a clean Social Security card

05:53.856 --> 05:56.023
and a new set
of fingerprints.

05:57.292 --> 05:59.043
Six will get you
the fingers.

05:59.045 --> 06:00.360
The fingers?

06:00.362 --> 06:02.029
Better to have and not need

06:02.031 --> 06:04.798
than to need and not have.

06:07.302 --> 06:09.887
Hey, uh, why don't you
just go to an ATM,

06:09.889 --> 06:12.806
pull out a few thousand dollars
and tell her you got a job?

06:12.808 --> 06:14.174
But that would be lying.

06:14.176 --> 06:18.345
Oh, no, you wouldn't want
to lie to her, Sam Wilson.

06:18.347 --> 06:20.097
Let me explain something
to you, Alan.

06:20.099 --> 06:22.232
Walden Schmidt lies.

06:22.234 --> 06:24.518
Sam Wilson tells the truth.

06:24.520 --> 06:27.237
Besides, I like
Sam Wilson's life.

06:27.239 --> 06:30.824
It feels more like...
I don't know, real life.

06:30.826 --> 06:32.076
Yeah, I get that.

06:32.078 --> 06:34.411
I mean, that's why I like
to sleep in your bed.

06:34.413 --> 06:36.897
Feels more like a real bed.

06:36.899 --> 06:38.065
Oh, and get this.

06:38.067 --> 06:39.366
I got a call from Billy today.

06:39.368 --> 06:43.420
We got an offer to buy
our company for $800 million.

06:46.374 --> 06:47.908
Excuse me a sec.

06:49.000 --> 06:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:02.256 --> 07:04.441
$800 million?!

07:04.443 --> 07:06.060
Yeah.

07:06.062 --> 07:07.394
We turned it down.

07:07.396 --> 07:09.229
You turned it down.

07:21.459 --> 07:22.659
Check it out.

07:23.461 --> 07:25.913
Oh, Sam!

07:25.915 --> 07:27.247
I hope you stole that.

07:27.249 --> 07:29.550
Ah, it wasn't that expensive.

07:29.552 --> 07:31.835
We barely made rent this month.

07:31.837 --> 07:34.505
I know,
but it's Christmas.

07:34.507 --> 07:36.140
You don't have to tell me.

07:36.142 --> 07:37.474
I'm earning extra money

07:37.476 --> 07:40.644
by making a Santa outfit
for my boss' Labradoodle.

07:40.646 --> 07:41.628
Aw, that's cute.

07:41.630 --> 07:42.846
Yeah, then I'm going to make

07:42.848 --> 07:45.349
three wise men costumes
for her cats.

07:45.351 --> 07:48.318
And just like that,
cute becomes creepy.

07:49.204 --> 07:50.604
Okay, I'm going
to go change.

07:50.606 --> 07:52.139
I've got a lead
on a job.

07:52.141 --> 07:53.123
Really?
Yeah.

07:53.125 --> 07:54.158
If that doesn't work,

07:54.160 --> 07:55.275
I'm going to rob a bank.

07:55.277 --> 07:58.695
I hope the 99 Cent Store
sells ski masks.

08:00.648 --> 08:03.450
Oh, man.
What?

08:03.452 --> 08:05.786
I forgot to give Santa
a tail-hole.

08:05.788 --> 08:08.822
Worst Christmas carol ever.

08:15.380 --> 08:17.347
Hey, Dad.
Hey, buddy.

08:17.349 --> 08:18.632
You excited about Christmas?

08:18.634 --> 08:20.450
Yeah, that's actually
why I was calling.

08:20.452 --> 08:22.953
I'm not going to be able
to make it home this year.

08:22.955 --> 08:24.688
What? Why?

08:24.690 --> 08:26.006
My girlfriend Tammy Sue

08:26.008 --> 08:28.342
asked me to spend Christmas
with her and her three kids.

08:28.344 --> 08:29.676
I'm pretending to be Santa

08:29.678 --> 08:31.645
and also their various fathers.

08:31.647 --> 08:33.346
Oh, kill me.

08:33.347 --> 08:35.682
H-H-How did you meet this woman?

08:35.683 --> 08:38.452
I play softball
with her parole officer.

08:38.453 --> 08:41.538
Oh, dig me up and kill me again.

08:41.539 --> 08:45.159
All right, well,
I hope I see you soon.

08:45.161 --> 08:46.460
Don't worry--
we'll all come visit

08:46.462 --> 08:48.879
as soon as Tammy Sue
gets her ankle bracelet off.

08:48.881 --> 08:52.166
That will be a magical day.

08:52.168 --> 08:53.300
Yeah.

08:53.302 --> 08:54.968
Well, all right--
Merry Christmas, Dad. Bye.

08:54.970 --> 08:57.137
Merry Christmas, Jake.

08:59.041 --> 09:02.559
Time now
for the magic of bourbon.

09:05.346 --> 09:06.379
Hi.

09:06.381 --> 09:08.015
I was here earlier.
I bought a tree.

09:08.017 --> 09:10.934
Uh, I was hoping I could talk
to you about something else.

09:10.936 --> 09:13.270
If somebody told you
I'm selling pot here,

09:13.272 --> 09:16.273
that is just crazy talk.

09:16.275 --> 09:17.641
Uh, no.

09:17.643 --> 09:20.110
I saw the "help wanted" sign.
I was hoping to get a job.

09:20.112 --> 09:21.945
Oh. Have a seat.

09:23.414 --> 09:25.749
You got any, uh,
Christmas tree experience?

09:26.752 --> 09:29.453
I-I've decorated a bunch.

09:30.506 --> 09:32.256
none.

09:32.258 --> 09:35.075
It's... Wait, it's selling
Christmas trees.

09:35.077 --> 09:36.193
Pop quiz, hot shot.

09:36.195 --> 09:38.128
A mom walks in;
she's driving a Lexus.

09:38.130 --> 09:39.963
She's got a big living room,
cathedral ceiling.

09:39.965 --> 09:41.048
What are you pushing?

09:41.050 --> 09:42.916
Balsam? Noble?
Doug fir?

09:42.918 --> 09:44.184
Uh...

09:44.186 --> 09:45.769
You're out of time.
She's across the street

09:45.771 --> 09:47.921
buying a 20-footer...

09:47.923 --> 09:50.557
from the Armenian.

09:51.809 --> 09:53.593
Are you comfortable
with celebrities?

09:53.595 --> 09:56.697
What do you mean?

09:56.699 --> 09:58.899
Mario Lopez buys
his tree here every year.

09:58.901 --> 10:01.268
I don't want you getting
all jelly-legged.

10:01.270 --> 10:02.536
All right, look.

10:02.538 --> 10:04.454
I'm young, I'm strong,
and I need the money.

10:04.456 --> 10:06.540
I'll work really hard
and I won't let you down.

10:06.542 --> 10:09.609
I'll give you seven bucks
an hour, plus tips.

10:09.611 --> 10:11.161
Minimum wage is eight.

10:11.163 --> 10:13.280
Look at my shoes.

10:13.282 --> 10:15.832
What about them?

10:15.834 --> 10:16.750
Where are they?

10:16.752 --> 10:20.620
Under the table...
Oh!

10:21.389 --> 10:22.923
I'm in.

10:22.925 --> 10:24.007
When can you start?

10:24.009 --> 10:25.559
Right now.

10:25.561 --> 10:27.644
A man with no life.
I like it.

10:27.646 --> 10:29.980
I'll go get you
some gloves.

10:31.317 --> 10:34.301
By the way, your cell phone's
like your penis.

10:34.303 --> 10:36.853
When you're at work,
you keep it in your pants.

10:40.491 --> 10:43.110
Hey, Billy, I'm kind of busy.

10:43.112 --> 10:46.113
I'm not in rehab.

10:46.115 --> 10:49.366
Relax, Zuckerberg
is not going to walk.

10:49.368 --> 10:51.835
Just sit tight and we'll
get the number we want.

10:51.837 --> 10:55.005
I got to go.
Bye.

10:55.007 --> 10:56.590
All right, here you go.

10:56.592 --> 10:58.091
Oh, and, uh, by the way.

10:58.093 --> 11:01.094
If somebody comes looking
for a Jamaican Christmas tree,

11:01.096 --> 11:03.347
you send them to me.

11:03.349 --> 11:05.165

11:37.077 --> 11:39.694
He only sold six, but the guy
crushes it with wreathes.

11:39.696 --> 11:40.912
Check it out.

11:40.914 --> 11:43.531

the nose until I sell 50 trees.

it just died on me.

11:59.482 --> 12:00.898
Okay, no problem.

12:00.900 --> 12:02.233
Sewing machines
can be fixed.

12:02.235 --> 12:03.818
No, it's gonna cost more
to fix it

12:03.820 --> 12:05.219
than I'll make on this job.

12:05.221 --> 12:06.887
Okay, it's not a problem.

12:06.889 --> 12:08.406
Look at the bright side,

12:08.408 --> 12:10.992

a Labradoodle and three cats

12:10.994 --> 12:12.660

Let's dance.

12:20.370 --> 12:22.120

13:15.675 --> 13:17.458
You remind me of a young me.

13:17.460 --> 13:19.977
Except you're a little taller

13:19.979 --> 13:23.231

13:38.898 --> 13:40.665

13:40.667 --> 13:43.000

13:43.002 --> 13:44.001
Oh, it's easy.

13:44.003 --> 13:45.453
You told Alan
you were working here.

13:45.455 --> 13:46.571
You swore him to secrecy.

13:46.573 --> 13:48.790
I gave him 100 bucks.
Bam, here I am.

13:48.792 --> 13:49.857
You want to buy a tree?

13:49.859 --> 13:51.008
No, no.

13:51.010 --> 13:52.460
I want to sell our company

13:52.462 --> 13:53.678
to Mark Zuckerberg.

13:53.680 --> 13:57.799
He has upped his offer
to $950 million.

13:57.801 --> 13:59.550
Wow, that's a lot of money.

13:59.552 --> 14:00.968
You know...

14:00.970 --> 14:03.554
I could probably get you
into this eight-foot cypress

14:03.556 --> 14:06.557
from Oregon for 50 bucks
off the sticker price.

14:06.559 --> 14:08.810
$950 million.

14:08.812 --> 14:10.395
We can buy Oregon.

14:10.397 --> 14:12.179
Look at how uptight you are.

14:12.181 --> 14:14.649
I mean, you should get a job
here with me selling trees.

14:14.651 --> 14:15.817
It's stress-free.

14:15.819 --> 14:17.184
Everybody leaves here happy--

14:17.186 --> 14:20.288
some people really happy
with a case of the munchies.

14:20.290 --> 14:22.857
Walden, let me just
call Zuckerberg

14:22.859 --> 14:24.208
and close the deal.

14:24.210 --> 14:26.878
You can close the deal at 1.2

14:26.880 --> 14:27.879
for 49% of the company.

14:27.881 --> 14:29.363
I'm not giving up control.

14:29.365 --> 14:30.498
You're crazy, all right?

14:30.500 --> 14:32.383
You are bat-crap freaking crazy.

14:32.385 --> 14:35.803
I've never been so sane
in my entire life.

14:35.805 --> 14:37.088
Now,

14:37.090 --> 14:38.473
if you'll excuse me,

14:38.475 --> 14:41.259
I've got a red, blinking nose
to live up to.

14:49.068 --> 14:51.185
Well, there's my Mrs. Claus.

14:51.187 --> 14:52.403
Hey, Alan.

14:52.405 --> 14:53.855
Good news: my mother bailed.

14:53.857 --> 14:55.523
She's having something
rejuvenated. Don't ask what.

14:55.525 --> 14:57.859
I did and haven't been able
to eat or sleep since.

14:59.411 --> 15:02.330
Jake is with his girlfriend
and her 17 kids,

15:02.332 --> 15:05.917
so it's just you and me, kiddo.

15:05.919 --> 15:07.285
I have some bad news.

15:07.287 --> 15:08.949
I'm not gonna be here
for Christmas.

15:08.974 --> 15:09.805
What?

15:09.806 --> 15:11.088
I have to go to Cleveland.

15:11.090 --> 15:13.040
My grandma fell down
and broke her hip.

15:13.042 --> 15:15.293
Big deal. Old people do that
all the time.

15:16.378 --> 15:17.879
It's like a cold with them.

15:17.881 --> 15:19.914
Can't your grandfather
take care of her?

15:19.916 --> 15:23.768
He's dead.
Man, I can't catch a break.

15:23.770 --> 15:25.252
We can celebrate
when I get back.

15:25.254 --> 15:28.272
Sure, nothing says Christmas
like January 3rd.

15:28.274 --> 15:29.724
I'm sorry, Alan.

15:29.726 --> 15:31.242
I don't have a choice.

15:31.244 --> 15:32.393
I know.

15:32.395 --> 15:33.761
It's okay.

15:33.763 --> 15:35.530
Well, I love you.

15:35.532 --> 15:36.697
I love you, too.

15:36.699 --> 15:37.865
Merry Christmas.

15:37.867 --> 15:39.600
Merry Christmas.

15:40.986 --> 15:42.787
Sometimes she can be so selfish.

15:42.789 --> 15:44.605
All right.

15:44.607 --> 15:45.890
I'm out of here.

15:54.216 --> 15:56.000
I'm gonna hate myself
for asking.

15:56.002 --> 15:57.418
What's wrong?

15:57.420 --> 15:59.337
Well, all my Christmas plans
have fallen apart.

15:59.339 --> 16:01.088
I-I'm gonna be all alone.

16:01.090 --> 16:02.673
Yeah, that's rough.

16:02.675 --> 16:04.842
Happy holidays, Zip.

16:20.475 --> 16:24.529
Hello, thank you for calling
the suicide hotline.

16:24.531 --> 16:28.082
All our counselors are busy,

16:28.084 --> 16:30.785
but your call
is very important to us.

16:30.787 --> 16:32.153
Please hold.

16:44.332 --> 16:45.383
Sam?

16:45.385 --> 16:47.101
Sorry, babe.

16:47.103 --> 16:48.519
I didn't mean to wake you up.

16:48.521 --> 16:50.054
How was work?

16:50.056 --> 16:51.839
My body aches.

16:51.841 --> 16:53.474
My hands are blistered.

16:53.476 --> 16:56.010
I can hardly feel my feet.

16:56.012 --> 16:58.012
It was awesome.

16:59.948 --> 17:02.283
I wish I felt that way
about my job.

17:02.285 --> 17:05.352
Yeah, but your job's
just a way to get by

17:05.354 --> 17:07.571
until you get your big break
as a designer.

17:07.574 --> 17:10.907
I've been getting by
for three years now.

17:10.910 --> 17:13.961
What if it never happens?

17:13.963 --> 17:15.746
I mean, for God's sakes,

17:15.748 --> 17:18.382
I don't even have
a sewing machine that works.

17:18.384 --> 17:20.217
You got a boyfriend that does.

17:21.369 --> 17:23.471
Did you sell more wreaths
than Jose?

17:23.473 --> 17:25.473
No.

17:25.474 --> 17:29.143
That guy is
a wreath-selling machine.

17:29.145 --> 17:31.479
He sold one to a guy
without a door.

17:33.849 --> 17:35.516
Aw.

17:35.518 --> 17:37.217
Is that mistletoe?

17:37.219 --> 17:38.736
It's supposed to be.

17:38.738 --> 17:41.489
It's actually broccoli.

17:41.491 --> 17:44.742
I thought it would
be romantic.

17:44.744 --> 17:46.494
It is.

17:46.496 --> 17:48.913

19:07.243 --> 19:09.476
I have Mark freaking Zuckerberg
on the phone.

19:09.478 --> 19:11.779
Is he at 1.2?
He's at a billion.

19:11.781 --> 19:13.831
All right now, Walden,
think about that number.

19:13.833 --> 19:15.916
You know how when you say
someone's one in a million?

19:15.918 --> 19:17.585
You could have a
thousand of them,

19:17.587 --> 19:19.319
but we have to give
him an answer.

19:19.321 --> 19:23.157
Okay, you tell him 1.2
for 49% of the company,

19:23.159 --> 19:24.542
and I'll throw in a wreath.

19:24.544 --> 19:25.826
Suck it, Jose.

19:25.828 --> 19:28.129
What do you think?

19:28.131 --> 19:29.430
I'll give you 30 bucks.

19:29.432 --> 19:31.298
70.
40.

19:31.300 --> 19:34.635
1.1. Don't make me bitch-slap
you in front of this child.

19:34.637 --> 19:36.937
1.2.

19:36.939 --> 19:39.356
65, and I'll flock it
for you myself.

19:39.358 --> 19:41.892
50.
60, and I'll throw in a stand.

19:41.894 --> 19:43.844
It's Christmas Eve.
You're not gonna move this tree.

19:43.846 --> 19:45.196
1.15. You say yes

19:45.198 --> 19:47.314
or I will shove that nose
up your Blitzen.

19:47.316 --> 19:49.316
1.2.

19:49.318 --> 19:50.985
It's Christmas Eve,

19:50.987 --> 19:53.353
and Santa needs a tree
to put the presents under.

19:53.355 --> 19:55.706
55, final offer.
1.2!

19:55.708 --> 19:57.041
Sold, sold.

19:57.043 --> 19:58.626
Yay!

19:59.796 --> 20:03.030
Oh, you did it,
you magnificent bastard.

20:04.966 --> 20:07.251
Really? Him, not me?

20:16.382 --> 20:17.749
♪ <i>Men.</i> ♪

20:17.751 --> 20:19.084
Who is this for?

20:19.086 --> 20:22.854
"To Kate, from Santa."

20:22.856 --> 20:26.708
I have a horrible feeling
this breaks our $20 rule.

20:26.710 --> 20:27.826
Open it.

20:27.828 --> 20:30.012
Okay.

20:32.849 --> 20:36.501
Oh, my God, Sam.

20:36.503 --> 20:38.169
A sewing machine?

20:39.022 --> 20:40.672
How can you afford this?

20:40.674 --> 20:42.724
Let's just say
I had a very good day

20:42.726 --> 20:44.509
at the Christmas tree lot.

20:46.113 --> 20:47.112
You like it?

20:47.114 --> 20:48.513
I love it.

20:51.183 --> 20:54.620
I feel kind of stupid
about the scarf now.

20:54.622 --> 20:55.904
Are you kidding me?

20:55.906 --> 20:57.322
This... You made this yourself.

20:57.324 --> 20:59.574
This is the best gift
I've ever gotten.

20:59.576 --> 21:00.626
Maybe later

21:00.628 --> 21:03.328
you can sew me
a little tail-hole.

21:05.164 --> 21:07.032
Merry Christmas, Sam.

21:07.034 --> 21:08.250
Oh, wait.

21:08.252 --> 21:13.000
Look what else Santa brought:
Broccletoe.
