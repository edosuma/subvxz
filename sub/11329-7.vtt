WEBVTT

00:00.294 --> 00:02.929
? of the American Teenager"...

00:02.930 --> 00:06.666
- Nice meeting you.
- I'm having an abortion.

00:06.667 --> 00:10.704
- I changed my mind. I couldn't do it.
- We're having a baby.

00:10.705 --> 00:13.206
Amy doesn't know
anything about this? Nope.

00:13.207 --> 00:16.043
Are you gonna tell Amy?
I think Ben should tell her.

00:16.044 --> 00:18.779
If you wanna set down some rules
for Jack, I totally understand.

00:18.780 --> 00:22.349
Rules for you and Jack. I'm not living
with Jack. Jack's living with Tom.

00:22.350 --> 00:24.518
No one's living anywhere
unless there's some rules.

00:24.519 --> 00:27.621
Adrian's having the baby.
I don't think so, Tom.

00:27.622 --> 00:31.525
- No. She is.
- If Mrs. Bowman or Mrs. Zegay

00:31.526 --> 00:35.195
or whatever
she's calling herself
said that you couldn't,

00:35.196 --> 00:37.798
then the answer is no, you
can't live in the guest house.

00:37.799 --> 00:39.566
I don't want Amy to find out.
It would break her heart.

00:39.567 --> 00:42.202
But Ben's gonna have to tell her
before someone else tells he

00:42.203 --> 00:44.938
- Did you tell Amy?
- I'm going to tell Amy.

00:44.939 --> 00:46.873
You're damn right
you're gonna tell Amy.

00:46.874 --> 00:49.209
And I'm really happy
Adrian changed her mind.

00:49.210 --> 00:52.612
You're really okay with
Adrian being a mother at 17?

00:52.613 --> 00:54.881
Today you just found out
you're becoming a father,

00:54.882 --> 00:57.484
so you can't tell the woman you
love that on the very same day.

00:57.485 --> 01:00.020
- It's understandable.
- Just don't wait too long.

01:08.329 --> 01:10.097
- Good morning.
- Yeah. Good morning.

01:10.098 --> 01:11.698
- Is John awake?
- I haven't heard him up.

01:11.699 --> 01:14.101
He's been awake,
but he's back asleep now.

01:14.102 --> 01:16.970
- I guess I overslept.
- Sorry.

01:16.971 --> 01:19.940
Thanks for getting him. I got
in kind of late last night.

01:19.941 --> 01:22.609
But who's asking? I hadn't
seen my mother in a while,

01:22.610 --> 01:24.778
so I just wanted John
to spend some time with her.

01:24.779 --> 01:27.247
You don't have to tell me lies.
We're not seeing each other.

01:27.248 --> 01:29.483
No, we're not,
and I'm not lying.

01:29.484 --> 01:31.218
- Really?
- Really.

01:33.488 --> 01:37.157
- Ashley, I'm not lying.
- You listen up.

01:37.158 --> 01:39.159
I've never given you
any reason to lie to me,

01:39.160 --> 01:41.027
so don't lie to me.

01:41.028 --> 01:43.864
It's insulting that you even think
that I would ca what you were doing,

01:43.865 --> 01:45.532
because I don't care
what you were doing

01:45.533 --> 01:49.469
or who you were
doing it with.
Okay? I don't.

01:49.470 --> 01:52.405
But you were definitely not spending
time with John at your mother's.

01:52.406 --> 01:55.542
I'm not stupid.
I thought you didn't care.

01:55.543 --> 01:58.979
You know, this is why you and I will
never ever be really involved, ever.

01:58.980 --> 02:01.181
'Cause I took my son
to visit my mother?

02:02.316 --> 02:04.718
You and I are never
gonna be really involved

02:04.719 --> 02:06.186
because I could
never marry you,

02:06.187 --> 02:08.455
and that's the only way I would
be really involved with you.

02:08.455 --> 02:11.558
Oh, no. You can't use that.
That's my line.
That's what I told you.

02:11.559 --> 02:13.560
All right, then. We're never
gonna be really involved

02:13.561 --> 02:15.061
because you're practically
my sister-in-law.

02:15.062 --> 02:16.997
- Oh. Sister-in-law.
- Is that right?

02:16.998 --> 02:19.065
Well, then, I guess you won't
have any trouble telling your wife

02:19.066 --> 02:21.368
that the guy she really loves,
Ben, is having a baby

02:21.369 --> 02:23.436
with the girl
she really hates, Adrian.

02:23.437 --> 02:26.439
'Cause there's only so long I can keep
avoiding her without telling her myself.

02:26.440 --> 02:28.441
No, you can't tell her. Ben
has to be the one to tell he.

02:28.442 --> 02:30.844
Yeah, he should be,
but he's not going to be.

02:30.845 --> 02:32.379
The next time she calls,
I'm gonna tell her

02:32.380 --> 02:33.780
you have something
you wanna tell her.

02:33.781 --> 02:35.949
- I'm not telling her.
- Why not? She's your wife.

02:35.950 --> 02:38.151
I didn't say that. You
know what I'm talking about.

02:38.152 --> 02:39.586
Yeah, I do know
what you're talking about.

02:39.587 --> 02:43.023
No, no, no. Do not blame me
for what's been going on here.

02:43.024 --> 02:44.257
- What's been going on here?
- Shh.

02:44.258 --> 02:45.592
You know what's
been going on here?

02:45.593 --> 02:48.261
Yeah, I do, Ashley, and we
should be ashamed of ourselves.

02:48.262 --> 02:49.963
Ashamed?

02:49.964 --> 02:52.132
You're not ashamed that you
tricked Amy into having sex,

02:52.133 --> 02:54.167
but you're ashamed that you're
feeling something for me?

02:54.168 --> 02:55.969
I didn't trick Amy.
I did not trick her.

02:55.970 --> 02:59.239
I just didn't know that she didn't
know what we were getting into and-

02:59.240 --> 03:02.542
I don't have to explain
that to you
because
you already know that.

03:02.543 --> 03:07.013
By the way,
you started flirting with me
long before I started
flirting back.

03:07.014 --> 03:09.816
Oh, I hate that word.
No one's flirting with anyone.

03:11.185 --> 03:15.121
We have feelings
for each other.
Real feelings.

03:15.122 --> 03:17.224
It's not just
a sexual attraction.

03:17.225 --> 03:22.596
Sexual? God!
And you know that.

03:22.597 --> 03:25.232
And you know what else?
Neither Amy nor Adrian

03:25.233 --> 03:27.167
care if we have real feelings
for each other.

03:27.168 --> 03:29.903
Actually, they might,
especially Amy.

03:29.904 --> 03:31.371
As well as your mom and dad.

03:31.372 --> 03:33.373
They can probably hear every
word we're saying at this point.

03:33.374 --> 03:37.811
So? Why do you care?
I don't care.

03:37.812 --> 03:40.747
And what, you've decided that you want
Amy now that you can't have Adrian?

03:40.748 --> 03:42.949
No. And who says
I can't have Adrian

03:42.950 --> 03:45.552
if I want Adrian,
or anyone else I want.

03:45.553 --> 03:50.357
Oh, get over yourself.
Wow. What was that?

03:50.358 --> 03:52.859
That's the sound of Ashley
falling in love with the wrong guy.

03:52.860 --> 03:56.429
You can't be serious.
In love? With Ricky?
Maybe attracted to him.

03:56.430 --> 03:58.598
Especially if it would bug her
sister. But in love? No way.

03:58.599 --> 04:01.868
Well, either way,
it's just so... wrong.

04:01.869 --> 04:06.539
It's not just wrong,
it's totally taboo.
Well, not totally, I guess.

04:06.540 --> 04:10.277
I mean, he and Amy were only
together that one time, and-

04:10.278 --> 04:12.279
Oh, God, am I actually
trying to justify this?

04:12.280 --> 04:14.881
This isn't happening. I'm gonna
tell him to take John and go home.

04:14.882 --> 04:17.951
No. Just tell him
to leave John
and go home for a few days,

04:17.952 --> 04:20.920
get away from all of us.
Good idea.

04:44.216 --> 04:48.586
I have some good news,
and I have some bad news.
Oh, boy.

04:48.587 --> 04:52.757
The bad news is that you're
going to be a grandmother,

04:52.758 --> 04:56.094
and the good news is that
you're going to be a grandmother.

04:56.095 --> 04:58.029
What is this again?

04:58.030 --> 05:02.567
It's called
the empty chair.
Yeah.
Good name for it.

05:02.568 --> 05:04.636
It's using
Gestalt therapy.

05:04.637 --> 05:06.571
I Googled it.
I thought it could help.

05:06.572 --> 05:10.642
Great. So now you're a
shrink as well as a doctor.

05:10.643 --> 05:12.977
These are my friends.
Would you like to meet them?

05:12.978 --> 05:18.183
Hi, uh, Mrs. Boykewich.
I'm Madison.
I'm Jack's girlfriend.

05:18.184 --> 05:23.288
Jack's not here.
He's visiting his parents.
But, um,
this is his old girlfriend.

05:23.289 --> 05:26.491
I'll take it from here.
Hi, Mrs. Boykewich.

05:26.492 --> 05:29.494
I'm Grace. Grace Bowman.
How are you?

05:29.495 --> 05:30.962
Probably not that good

05:30.963 --> 05:32.831
since I just told her she's
going to be a grandmother.

05:32.832 --> 05:35.233
But, see, you managed
to tell your mom,

05:35.234 --> 05:37.168
so you can manage
to tell Amy.

05:37.169 --> 05:41.773
There is one big difference.
Yeah. His mom's dead.

05:41.774 --> 05:46.344
Bingo.
Bye, Mom.

05:46.345 --> 05:48.980
Maybe next time,
I'll come visit you

05:48.981 --> 05:51.316
at your place
or visit by myself

05:51.317 --> 05:53.952
or- or with Adrian.

05:53.953 --> 05:56.221
Maybe you'd like
to meet Adrian.

05:58.824 --> 06:03.761
I don't think you told her
who Adrian is.
Oh. Right.

06:03.762 --> 06:07.332
Um, Adrian
is Ricky's ex-girlfriend

06:07.333 --> 06:09.868
and the soon-to-be mother
of my baby.

06:09.869 --> 06:12.871
I had sex my very first time
with her.

06:12.872 --> 06:16.007
In the car.
In front of her house.

06:16.008 --> 06:19.577
Even though she lives next door
to Amy, the woman I love,

06:19.578 --> 06:21.579
and Adrian and I don't
really love each other.

06:21.580 --> 06:27.151
We just
kind of like each other.
We're friends-

06:27.152 --> 06:29.487
friends who are gonna
have a baby together.

06:31.790 --> 06:33.758
There's nothing worse
than losing a parent.

06:33.759 --> 06:38.062
Wait. Hold that thought.
That's a really good thought

06:38.063 --> 06:40.698
'cause telling Amy is not gonna be
worse than when you lost your mother.

06:43.802 --> 06:45.236
Sorry. I'm the newest member.

06:45.237 --> 06:47.005
I didn't know what to say.
Give me a break.

06:47.006 --> 06:48.840
And yet you came up with this.

06:57.082 --> 07:00.518
Who's there?
It's your mommy.

07:11.163 --> 07:13.331
What do you want?
Ouch.

07:13.332 --> 07:18.970
Mind if I come in?
How'd you get in?

07:18.971 --> 07:20.972
You know what?
I think someone must've left

07:20.973 --> 07:23.841
the alarm system off
when they got here.

07:23.842 --> 07:31.049
God, this is... nice.
I mean, it's old, but-
Ah.

07:34.653 --> 07:37.722
It's- It's nice.
You got a nice place here.

07:37.723 --> 07:40.992
Yeah, I know.
What do you want?

07:40.993 --> 07:43.061
What makes you think
I want something?

07:43.062 --> 07:45.296
Ah, never mind. Everyone
always wants something.

07:45.297 --> 07:49.200
I want something,
you want something.
Not from you, I don't.

07:49.201 --> 07:51.703
But you obviously want something
from me. What do you want from me?

07:51.704 --> 07:54.606
You came to visit me.
Now I'm coming to visit you.

07:54.607 --> 07:58.242
If you don't want the
money back, I don't have it.
I put it in the bank.

07:58.243 --> 08:01.346
No, I don't want it back.
I don't want my money back.

08:02.581 --> 08:06.484
Where's the kid?
Why? You want my kid?

08:06.485 --> 08:08.052
'Cause you can't have
my kid.

08:08.053 --> 08:10.855
I don't want him. I wouldn't
mind seeing him. That's all.

08:10.856 --> 08:14.192
No. Never.
All right.

08:14.193 --> 08:16.628
I just thought I'd ask.
No harm asking, right?

08:16.629 --> 08:19.230
Just say it. I'm not in the
mood to play any games with you.

08:19.231 --> 08:22.533
What are you here for?

08:22.534 --> 08:28.272
Okay. Well, I'm not dying.
I just came to say goodbye.

08:30.743 --> 08:32.744
I violated my parole,

08:32.745 --> 08:37.048
and I've gotta turn myself in
to the county women's prison

08:37.049 --> 08:44.889
by midnight Monday, tomorrow,
so... I just thought we could

08:44.890 --> 08:49.627
spend the time catching up.
Not if you have drugs on you.

08:49.628 --> 08:51.629
Oh, no, no, no.
No, nothing like that.

08:51.630 --> 08:53.898
No, I'm clean and sober.
Then what happened?

08:53.899 --> 08:59.137
I forgot to take my gun
out of my purse
when I reported
to my parole officer.

09:00.239 --> 09:02.640
- I carry a gun.
- Why?

09:02.641 --> 09:05.243
Because I don't feel like
ever getting beat up again.

09:05.244 --> 09:07.011
Don't you know
how dangerous guns are?

09:07.012 --> 09:08.913
Don't you know
how dangerous my life is?

09:08.914 --> 09:10.581
Do you know how dangerous
your life is with a gun?

09:10.582 --> 09:13.685
Come on. Let's just
spend some time together.

09:13.686 --> 09:16.788
It'll be fun.
This is a bad time.

09:16.789 --> 09:18.790
- Oh, really?
- It's a bad time?

09:18.791 --> 09:23.561
What, you have, like, a,
you know, rehearsal
for the school play

09:23.562 --> 09:26.164
or, like, a band competition
or a pep rally or...

09:26.165 --> 09:29.267
Stop, okay?
Amy's not in town,

09:29.268 --> 09:32.270
and I've been staying over at her
parents' house taking care of John.

09:32.271 --> 09:35.339
John's my first priority.
That's totally understandable.

09:35.340 --> 09:40.178
Very admirable.
What priority is your mother?

09:40.179 --> 09:43.347
My mother
who violated her parole
and is going
back to the slammer?

09:43.348 --> 09:44.982
Do you have another mother?

09:44.983 --> 09:47.485
As a matter of fact,
I do,

09:47.486 --> 09:54.192
since you weren't really
much of a mother to me.
All right.

09:54.193 --> 09:58.296
- Margaret. How is Margaret?
- She's fine.

09:58.297 --> 10:03.701
Well, I'm not so fine.
Come on, Ricky.

10:03.702 --> 10:08.673
It's gonna be a minimum
18 months of lockup.

10:08.674 --> 10:12.310
I mean, prison sucks.
I don't know.

10:13.545 --> 10:16.247
Yes? Do it, please?

10:16.248 --> 10:18.950
I have school tomorrow. After
school, I'll pick you up.

10:18.951 --> 10:21.285
We'll go get an ice cream like
we did when you were little.

10:22.921 --> 10:24.756
I always meant to do that.

10:24.757 --> 10:28.259
Yeah.
Yeah, you'll do it?

10:28.260 --> 10:31.329
I guess.
Yes!

10:31.330 --> 10:33.831
Hey, you want to get stoned?
I got a prescription.

10:33.832 --> 10:39.737
I am kidding you. Where's
your sense of humor, pops?
I'm sober. I am.

10:39.738 --> 10:42.306
I mean, everyone else in the
world has a prescription for pot,

10:42.307 --> 10:46.277
but not me.
Well, you better be sober.

10:46.278 --> 10:49.614
'Cause if you're not, and I
even think you're doing drugs-

10:49.615 --> 10:51.549
any drug, any-

10:51.550 --> 10:55.286
I'm not gonna have
any sympathy for you.
I will turn you in myself.

10:55.287 --> 10:57.622
That's kind of what
I'm asking you to do for me.

10:57.623 --> 10:59.690
Tomorrow. Turn me in.

11:01.126 --> 11:04.095
But, anyway, no drugs.
Really.

11:04.096 --> 11:08.966
Just good old clean
family fun.
Okay?

11:20.044 --> 11:22.813
- Hey, Dad, I just wanna say good night.
- Not so fast.

11:22.814 --> 11:25.082
Dad, it's, uh, late.
I've got school tomorrow.

11:25.083 --> 11:26.817
I know that.

11:26.818 --> 11:28.752
That's why I thought
you'd be home earlier.

11:28.753 --> 11:32.022
You got some business to take
care of, don't you? Um, business?

11:32.023 --> 11:35.592
What business?
Stop it.
Did you call Amy or not?

11:35.593 --> 11:38.896
Dad, do you remember
when you said

11:38.897 --> 11:42.499
that you and I are gonna be angry
with each other now and then?

11:42.500 --> 11:45.736
Well-
Well, you didn't call her,
so I'm angry.

11:45.737 --> 11:47.905
And you're only
going to get angrier

11:47.906 --> 11:51.341
because I decided I'm not
going to call her.

11:51.342 --> 11:54.311
It's just not
the best thing for Amy

11:54.312 --> 11:57.915
or me or Amy and me right now
to tell her about Adrian.

11:57.916 --> 12:02.286
How do you figure? Dad, this is
an intense music program she's at.

12:02.287 --> 12:03.787
You know,
she has to concentrate.

12:03.788 --> 12:06.290
She doesn't need the
distractions and neither do I.

12:06.291 --> 12:08.325
I figure there's another week
of school left,

12:08.326 --> 12:11.962
and then after that,
she's in New York
two more weeks,
and then she'll be home.

12:11.963 --> 12:14.431
Uh-huh. And I'll deal with it then.

12:14.432 --> 12:16.967
I see. And if someone else
tells her, then what?

12:16.968 --> 12:21.405
I don't think
anyone else will tell her,
you know,
when I thought about it.

12:21.406 --> 12:24.641
I mean, who just calls people up
and gives them bad news?

12:24.642 --> 12:26.009
Hi, is this Amy Juergens?
Yeah.

12:26.010 --> 12:27.945
Your boyfriend Ben
got Adrian pregnant.

12:27.946 --> 12:30.581
You know? Who's gonna do that?
I know who's gonna do that.

12:30.582 --> 12:32.216
- Who?
- You.

12:32.217 --> 12:35.385
'Cause I told you to do that,
and you're going to do that.

12:35.386 --> 12:39.289
I gave you a chance
to do it your way,
and now I'm gonna make you
do it my way.

12:39.290 --> 12:40.791
Dad, make?

12:40.792 --> 12:42.426
You're gonna make me
do it? How?

12:42.427 --> 12:45.495
I'll tell you how. Tuesday
morning, we're gonna get on the jet,

12:45.496 --> 12:47.564
and we're gonna go to New York,
just you and me,

12:47.565 --> 12:50.267
and you're gonna see Amy,
and you're gonna tell her.

12:50.268 --> 12:53.904
Now, I understand
that you're scared,

12:53.905 --> 12:56.073
but you can do this,
and you will do this.

12:56.074 --> 12:58.842
And if I don't do it?
Then we'll get on the jet

12:58.843 --> 13:00.777
and fly to the closest
military school

13:00.778 --> 13:03.447
and enroll you
so you can learn to be a man.

13:03.448 --> 13:06.250
If you can't learn from me,
I'll hand you over
to the professionals.

13:07.619 --> 13:09.987
- How's that sound?
- Ridiculous.

13:09.988 --> 13:11.855
Look, son,

13:11.856 --> 13:14.124
I know you're still in a
state of shock about all this,

13:14.125 --> 13:15.592
and I'll use that as an excuse

13:15.593 --> 13:20.163
not to completely lose
my temper here.
But in this house,
what I say goes.

13:21.366 --> 13:23.300
I'm gonna help you with this.

13:23.301 --> 13:26.470
I'm gonna help you.
We've got a six-hour flight

13:26.471 --> 13:30.574
and a 45-minute trip
into Manhattan.
We're gonna talk.

13:30.575 --> 13:33.377
We're gonna rehearse
what you're going to say,

13:33.378 --> 13:34.878
and by the time we get there,

13:34.879 --> 13:37.314
you'll be ready and prepared
to do what you have to do.

13:37.315 --> 13:40.584
No, I won't.
I'll never be prepared
to do this, Dad.

13:40.585 --> 13:43.820
You don't understand.
You just don't understand.

13:43.821 --> 13:46.223
You don't know what it's like to have
to tell someone bad news like this.

13:46.224 --> 13:49.626
I don't, huh?
Didn't you spend half the day

13:49.627 --> 13:53.363
talking to an empty chair in Grace's kitchen?
Is there no privacy in that car?

13:53.364 --> 13:56.033
Does our driver have to tell you
everywhere I go and everything I do?

13:56.034 --> 13:58.201
- Mike works for me.
- He doesn'work for you.

13:58.202 --> 13:59.670
No one who works
in this house

13:59.671 --> 14:01.772
works for you.
- They work for me.

14:01.773 --> 14:04.341
When you hire people
and they work for you,

14:04.342 --> 14:06.843
you might expect them to do
whatever you tell them to do.

14:06.844 --> 14:09.179
I tell Mike to tell me
where he takes you.

14:09.180 --> 14:10.547
I'm sure you know that.

14:10.548 --> 14:12.316
- I'm not a kid.
- I can drive myself.

14:12.317 --> 14:14.318
Yeah, but you can't drive
other people,

14:14.319 --> 14:17.020
and you didn't, so let's
not get sidetracked here.

14:18.856 --> 14:22.993
The point was that everyone
has to deliver bad news

14:22.994 --> 14:25.028
sometime in their life
if they live long enough.

14:25.029 --> 14:27.831
You remember the day
I had to sit you down

14:27.832 --> 14:32.869
and tell you that your mom
wasn't gonna make it-
she was gonna leave us?

14:32.870 --> 14:35.639
That was the hardest conversation
I ever had with anyone.

14:35.640 --> 14:38.442
I thought you meant she was
just going to Florida.

14:38.443 --> 14:40.911
It took me days to realize you
meant she was leaving permanently.

14:40.912 --> 14:45.182
- I remember.
- I remember that you wanted to go with her to Florida.

14:45.183 --> 14:48.251
- I wish I had.
- No, you don't.

14:48.252 --> 14:51.822
You'll get through this.
We'll all get through this.

14:51.823 --> 14:54.691
But first,
you've got to tell Amy,

14:54.692 --> 14:57.928
and I want you to tell her
face to face.

14:57.929 --> 15:00.764
- All right, Dad.
- Then I'll do it.

15:00.765 --> 15:03.500
- That what I want to hear.
- He's kidnapping me.

15:03.501 --> 15:05.602
Yeah, but on a private jet
to New York.

15:05.603 --> 15:06.837
- I'll go.
Me, too.

15:06.838 --> 15:08.505
- You can't go.
- Either of you.

15:08.506 --> 15:10.507
It's a father-son trip,
not a joyride.

15:10.508 --> 15:12.042
He's got this crazy idea
in his head

15:12.043 --> 15:14.277
that the two of us are gonna
rehearse what I'm gonna say to Amy,

15:14.278 --> 15:15.979
and then we'll take her out
to a nice restaurant

15:15.980 --> 15:18.582
and buy her a piece of pecan pie,
and it'll all be better.

15:18.583 --> 15:21.118
Not right away, of course.
After the pie.

15:21.119 --> 15:24.755
He knows this great place
where they have
a good pecan pie.

15:24.756 --> 15:27.858
Amy once ate
an entire pecan pie here.
I like pecan pie.

15:27.859 --> 15:32.496
Yeah, girls like desserts.
That's been my experience.
Your experience, huh?

15:32.497 --> 15:35.265
I know a way out of this if you really,
really don't want to go to New York.

15:35.266 --> 15:37.134
- What? What is it?
- Finally, some help.

15:37.135 --> 15:38.935
Call Amy and tell her tonight.

15:38.936 --> 15:41.819
- What, are you crazy?
- Yeah, what, are you crazy?

15:42.373 --> 15:45.442
Just being supportive of Ben.

15:45.443 --> 15:48.745
Listen to me. People are gonna be
talking about this tomorrow at school.

15:48.746 --> 15:51.515
The more people who know, the more
likely it is that someone will tell Amy.

15:51.516 --> 15:54.251
Not that she doesn't know already.
Maybe that's why she's calling you.

15:54.252 --> 15:56.420
No. She's also texting.
And she doesn't know.

15:56.421 --> 15:59.156
And it's not gonna get out at
school. I mean, not right away.

15:59.157 --> 16:01.858
Adrian's not gonna want to just
tell everyone that she's pregnant.

16:01.859 --> 16:05.028
Not right now. She just
decided to have the baby.

16:05.029 --> 16:07.597
And it's not like
she's showing or anything.

16:07.598 --> 16:10.066
She's not Amy. She may want
to tell people right away.

16:10.067 --> 16:12.169
Have you two even discussed
when you're gonna tell people?

16:12.170 --> 16:14.404
She said that
she'll decide that.

16:14.405 --> 16:16.606
I have a feeling that
she's gonna decide everything.

16:16.607 --> 16:20.076
As she should. Just about the only
thing you have any control over

16:20.077 --> 16:22.078
is when Amy finds out
and from whom,

16:22.079 --> 16:24.080
and you are losing that control
minute by minute.

16:24.081 --> 16:28.919
- The clock is ticking. It just takes one Tweet.
- I can't call her. I'll go to New York.

16:28.920 --> 16:32.389
- You sure you don't want us to go?
- You can't go.

16:33.991 --> 16:37.194
- Oh, No. It's Ricky.
- Have you talked to him? Did you tell him?

16:37.195 --> 16:42.866
- He knows. I'm sure he knows.
- Hello?

16:42.867 --> 16:46.803
- I need a ride to school tomorrow.
- All right. I can do that.

16:46.804 --> 16:51.641
- I can pick you up. Besides, we should talk. 
- Yeah, we should.

16:59.628 --> 17:01.629
Oh, Amy, that's terrible.

17:01.630 --> 17:06.233
You're cutting out. We'll get you
 a new phone. We will.

17:06.233 --> 17:08.669
She texted me, asking me
if I'm getting her texts,

17:08.670 --> 17:11.238
because no one's picking up the phone,
and she can't get through to anyone.

17:11.239 --> 17:13.073
I hope she doesn't. Not
for another couple of weeks.

17:13.074 --> 17:16.710
- Dad, someone has to tell her.
- Ashley, no one has to tell her. Not yet.

17:16.711 --> 17:18.779
Now go grab John.
I gotta drop you two off.

17:18.780 --> 17:20.314
No, I'm riding w w with Ad.
You take John.

17:20.315 --> 17:22.415
No, I need you to take John to
the nursery. He's used to you.

17:22.416 --> 17:24.084
He's not used to me going in
and leaving.

17:24.085 --> 17:27.488
- Besides, we need to talk.
- Talk about what?

17:27.489 --> 17:29.957
It rhymes with icky.
Just say what you want to say.

17:29.958 --> 17:34.562
You can't date
your sister's... impregnator.
Impregnator, huh?

17:34.563 --> 17:38.232
Boy, I'll bet Mom will let me
make up my own mind about that.

17:38.233 --> 17:40.401
She's thone who asked me
to talk to you about this,

17:40.402 --> 17:44.104
because, you know,
you and I are buddies.
Well, if you
overheard us clearly,

17:44.105 --> 17:46.974
you'll know that I'm not
interested in being... impregnated,

17:46.975 --> 17:50.077
and there's no chance that I'll
be impregnated by the impregnator.

17:50.078 --> 17:52.112
Because you're actually
taking those pills,

17:52.113 --> 17:53.981
or because you realize
you're playing with fire here,

17:53.982 --> 17:57.151
and this is not a good idea-
you and Ricky flirting around
with each other?

17:57.152 --> 18:02.122
I believe you also overheard
what I think of the word flirting.
Is it so hard for you

18:02.123 --> 18:06.594
to believe that Ricky
has feelings for me?
We were friends.

18:06.595 --> 18:09.263
Now he's not looking at me
the way a guy looks at a friend,

18:09.264 --> 18:10.764
and I'm not looking at him
that way, either.

18:10.765 --> 18:14.735
Well, then stop
looking at each other,
because it can never,
never work, Ashley.

18:14.736 --> 18:20.908
It could, but it's not
going to, because-
because he's not
marriage material.

18:20.909 --> 18:24.211
He doesn't take
his commitments seriously.
That's
what we were discussing-

18:24.212 --> 18:28.082
who was taking his son
to the nursery this morning.
If I weren't afraid
of speaking to Amy,

18:28.083 --> 18:31.185
I'd tell her
he's being a deadbeat.
We told him to take
a couple of days.

18:31.186 --> 18:34.488
He's a grown man.
He doesn't have to do
what other people's parents
tell him to do.

18:35.957 --> 18:40.761
And he didn't
even call me last night.
Ashley, really.

18:40.762 --> 18:42.763
I've been watching you two
the past couple of weeks.

18:42.764 --> 18:46.033
I didn't want to tell
either one of you
to stay away from the other.

18:46.034 --> 18:47.935
I was afraid that that
would drive you two together.

18:47.936 --> 18:50.871
But now I'm telling you,
stay away from Ricky.

19:02.050 --> 19:03.550
I told you
I'd come out front.

19:03.551 --> 19:05.552
I thought maybe we could talk
before we get in the car.

19:05.553 --> 19:07.187
I don't think so.
In the car is fine.

19:07.188 --> 19:09.857
I'm a new driver, okay?
I have a provisional license,

19:09.858 --> 19:12.993
which means you'd
have to drive my car,
and I'd rather you not
drive my car

19:12.994 --> 19:14.995
when we talk about
what we need to talk about.

19:14.996 --> 19:20.000
Did you tell Amy
that Adrian's having the baby?
Uh, no.
I thought I'd tell you first.

19:20.001 --> 19:22.002
I already know.
See how that goes?

19:22.003 --> 19:25.472
Someone told me
before you told me.
You better tell Amy.

19:29.044 --> 19:31.645
This is why you wanted me
to wait out front.

19:31.646 --> 19:34.882
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

19:34.883 --> 19:37.184
I'm Ben Boykewich.
Nice to meet you.

19:37.185 --> 19:39.219
Yeah, you two- You know,

19:39.220 --> 19:41.889
you look more like a virgin
than I thought you would, Ben.

19:41.890 --> 19:44.858
You got a little Jimmy Stewart
thing going on there, don't you?

19:44.859 --> 19:49.897
- I get that sometimes.
- This is my mother.
- I've met your mother.

19:50.046 --> 19:52.466
No, I'm his birth mother.
He came out of me.

19:52.467 --> 19:56.053
Yeah, ter many,
many hours of pain.

19:56.684 --> 20:00.975
I shouldn't have mentioned that.
You're having a baby yourself

20:00.976 --> 20:05.312
- with his old girlfriend.
- This is your mother?
- I said that.

20:05.313 --> 20:07.915
She said that. How many
people need to tell you that?

20:07.916 --> 20:10.417
Hey, do you have time for
breakfast? I can scramble some eggs.

20:10.418 --> 20:15.522
Oh, can you? Who knew?
This is why I needed you
to pick me up.

20:15.523 --> 20:19.526
- I'm letting my mom
have my car today.
- Oh, I see.

20:19.527 --> 20:23.097
Do you want me to ask my dad
if the driver can drive her?

20:23.098 --> 20:27.835
- Should she really be driving your car?
- Drugs don't make you deaf, Ben.

20:27.836 --> 20:30.838
I mean, they're bad for you, for
sure, but they don't make you deaf.

20:30.839 --> 20:34.041
And, actually, I'm sober right now,
and I can hear everything you say.

20:34.042 --> 20:39.380
- I apologize. 
- Save your apologies
for Amy, huh? Have you told her?

20:39.381 --> 20:42.850
No, he hasn't.
I filled her in.

20:42.851 --> 20:46.220
We had a lot of time
to catch up last night.

20:46.221 --> 20:52.126
No, I haven't told Amy yet.
But my dad is insisting that we fly to New York

20:52.127 --> 20:56.330
so I can tell her in person,
which I really don't want to do.

20:56.331 --> 20:59.666
Sounds like a lot of money for
a lot of nothing, if you ask me.

20:59.667 --> 21:02.736
He didn't ask you.
And, Mom, no advice, okay?

21:02.737 --> 21:05.072
No. Please. Go ahead.

21:05.073 --> 21:08.675
Let someone else
tell her, right?
I mean, this isn't
about you and Amy.

21:08.676 --> 21:12.613
This is about you
and that other one,

21:12.614 --> 21:16.283
his girlfriend-
ex-girlfriend- Adrian.
Go on.

21:16.284 --> 21:21.422
Well, if you ask me,
and he did...
I mean,

21:21.423 --> 21:23.590
you know, what goes around
comes around, right?

21:24.625 --> 21:29.029
Amy has no reason to be upset with you.
She had a baby by him.

21:29.030 --> 21:31.932
I mean, a baby, by the way,
who I have never met.

21:31.933 --> 21:35.702
And, uh, really,
I'm going into
the slammer tonight,

21:35.703 --> 21:38.138
and I probably won't ever
meet little John

21:38.139 --> 21:41.275
until, like, 18 months
to two years.

21:42.911 --> 21:45.279
Thank you for the advice.

21:45.280 --> 21:50.818
Um, we should probably
run along now.
Well, yeah.
I mean, nice meeting you.

21:50.819 --> 21:52.453
You're gonna pick me up
from school, right?

21:52.454 --> 21:55.255
Yeah. Where was that?

21:55.256 --> 21:58.058
That was a joke.
Is nothing funny to you?

21:58.059 --> 21:59.927
You know how many days
I stood outside school

21:59.928 --> 22:04.098
- waiting for you to pick me up?
- I can bring you back here.

22:04.099 --> 22:06.934
Yeah, that's a much better plan.
Don't wreck the car, all right?

22:06.935 --> 22:11.071
- All right.
Okay, go to school.
- Have fun.

22:11.072 --> 22:14.274
- Don't get into trouble.
- Actually, that's a little late.

22:14.275 --> 22:23.450
- You guys have both already
gotten into trouble, haven't you?
- Yeah.

22:30.125 --> 22:32.659
Is she really going back
to the slammer?

22:32.660 --> 22:36.497
- Yeah, she is.
- She came in last night.

22:36.498 --> 22:39.166
She wanted to spend
some time with me,

22:39.167 --> 22:41.768
and I couldn't say no.

22:41.769 --> 22:43.770
Well, I could've,
but I didn't.

22:43.771 --> 22:46.240
She wants me to go with her
to surrender.

22:46.241 --> 22:49.309
They tell you when to show up, and you
show up. But does she really have to?

22:49.310 --> 22:51.145
I mean, she seems okay
to me. Yes, she has to.

22:51.146 --> 22:53.113
She showed up for a meeting
with her parole officer

22:53.114 --> 22:56.083
with a gun in her purse.
Was she gonna kill him?

22:56.084 --> 22:59.520
Ben, she always
has a gun in her purse.
She doesn't run around
with a nice crowd.

22:59.521 --> 23:01.922
Then it makes sense for her
to carry a gun, I guess.

23:01.923 --> 23:05.492
Doesn't make sense.
Guns are dangerous,
and she shouldn't have been
carrying a gun.

23:05.493 --> 23:07.928
Not to mention it's against
the law, and she's on parole.

23:07.929 --> 23:09.363
Whatever. Let's go.

23:11.266 --> 23:13.667
What are you doing here so
early? Good morning to you, too.

23:13.668 --> 23:16.603
Good morning,
and thanks, Bunny.

23:16.604 --> 23:20.174
You thought I'd leave my mom
alone with access to the shop? No.

23:20.175 --> 23:22.176
See you two after school.

23:29.651 --> 23:33.820
- Morning.
- Hi, Adrian. How are you?

23:33.821 --> 23:37.658
- I'm fine.
How are you?
- Good.

23:37.659 --> 23:41.128
I spent some time with Ben
yesterday, and his mother.

23:41.129 --> 23:43.463
Wait. His mother?
You mean Betty?

23:43.464 --> 23:46.667
- No, the dead one.
- Oh, of course.

23:46.668 --> 23:48.602
The dead one.
I see.

23:48.603 --> 23:51.238
I hope you're not jealous.
No, not in the least.

23:51.239 --> 23:53.540
It was a meeting
of the Dead Parents' Club,

23:53.541 --> 23:56.143
and he introduced all of us,
and he told his mom about you.

23:56.144 --> 23:59.346
It was so moving.
- Oh, I'm sorry I missed that.

23:59.347 --> 24:02.883
Were there snacks?
Yeah, of course.
- But don't worry.

24:02.884 --> 24:04.685
He's gonna introduce you
another time, if you want.

24:04.686 --> 24:06.353
Yeah, sure.

24:06.354 --> 24:09.856
Oh, you know, maybe when she's had
some time to get used to the idea.

24:09.857 --> 24:13.427
Yeah. I mean,
I'm not even used to the idea,
and I'm your best friend.

24:13.428 --> 24:14.928
Well, get used to it

24:14.929 --> 24:17.564
'cause I'm having a baby,
and I'm happy about it.

24:17.565 --> 24:19.766
You know,
Tom's been asking about you.

24:19.767 --> 24:21.235
He knows you're not
gonna marry him,

24:21.236 --> 24:22.936
but he still
wants to be friends.

24:22.937 --> 24:27.641
So maybe you could call him.
Sure.
Actually,
could you call him tonight?

24:27.642 --> 24:31.378
'Cause I don't think he's
gonna have a very good day.
No?

24:31.379 --> 24:33.947
Um, what's a bad day for Tom?
Tom's always happy.

24:33.948 --> 24:37.284
He's up for this job
at the courthouse.
He got the job, actually.

24:37.285 --> 24:42.589
But now he has to take
a drug test.
And that's
a problem because...

24:42.590 --> 24:45.325
Because he and Jack
got into some pot brownies

24:45.326 --> 24:47.361
that somebody left in our
guest house refrigerator.

24:47.362 --> 24:50.897
What? Well, I'm glad
he didn't give me any.

24:50.898 --> 24:53.467
What if they had given me pot
brownies? I'm having a baby.

24:53.468 --> 24:55.402
Shh!
Oh, shush about what?

24:55.403 --> 24:58.238
The pot or the baby? I don't
care who knows about the baby.

24:58.239 --> 24:59.973
What's that about?

24:59.974 --> 25:02.476
Oh, I didn't tell you?
She decided to keep the baby.

25:03.678 --> 25:05.612
That's it.
That's it, Madison.

25:05.613 --> 25:11.351
We are no longer best friends.
Jesse!
Oh, well, don't get upset.

25:11.352 --> 25:14.221
I had a hectic weekend. I
didn't get a chance to tell you.

25:14.222 --> 25:16.623
Why? Too busy doing this?

25:18.893 --> 25:22.462
And this.
Oh, and this.

25:24.132 --> 25:26.433
Two can play that game.
Come on, Jesse.

25:26.434 --> 25:27.734
All right.

25:27.735 --> 25:30.437
- Wait. Wait a minute.
- Lauren...

25:30.438 --> 25:35.275
We're gonna be spending
a lot of time together.
Fine by me.

25:43.484 --> 25:48.255
Hey, guys.
So, guess you heard.

25:48.256 --> 25:49.723
- No.
- Yes.

25:49.724 --> 25:52.826
Y- Yes.
- No.
Maybe.

25:52.827 --> 25:57.464
It's okay.
You're Ben's best friends.
I'm sure you know.

25:57.465 --> 26:03.203
And if you didn't,
I'm pregnant.
And I'm okay with that.

26:03.204 --> 26:11.478
So talk about me
all you want.
Attention, everyone.

26:11.479 --> 26:16.416
Attention.
Yes, I'm having a baby.

26:16.417 --> 26:19.319
And I don't care who knows about
it or what you have to say about it.

26:22.423 --> 26:25.492
Oh, and it's Ben's.

26:43.709 --> 26:45.209
Are you kidding me?

26:45.210 --> 26:47.378
You can't eat too much meat.
Where'd you get that?

26:47.379 --> 26:50.882
Uh, my doctor.
Ah. Okay.
Think about it.

26:50.883 --> 26:53.851
Your doctor wants you
to be sick, right?

26:53.852 --> 26:55.386
If you're sick,
you go to the doctor.

26:55.387 --> 26:57.922
Ergo, if you don't eat meat,
you get weak,

26:57.923 --> 27:03.428
you get sick,
you go to the doctor.
I never thought
about it like that.

27:03.429 --> 27:07.665
Give me a steak.
Make that two of them.
Coming right up.

27:07.666 --> 27:10.902
Wait till you see what
this does for your sex life.

27:10.903 --> 27:13.604
Protein equals protein,
my friend.

27:16.041 --> 27:17.542
I can't believe it.

27:17.543 --> 27:20.311
She didn't even discuss it
with me- when to tell people.

27:20.312 --> 27:23.181
I told you so,
and your dad told you so,
and your friends told you so.

27:23.182 --> 27:27.385
- And I told you so.
- What the- No, no.

27:27.386 --> 27:31.155
Leave her alone.
I hired her for the day.
I'd hire her for longer

27:31.156 --> 27:34.992
if she didn't
already have plans.
She's good.

27:34.993 --> 27:38.162
Ah, just earning a little
cigarette money. You smoke?

27:38.163 --> 27:40.264
Oh, it's not the smoking
that's gonna kill me, dude.

27:40.265 --> 27:42.166
It's the showers
that are gonna kill me.

27:42.167 --> 27:44.068
The cigarettes are just
a little bargaining tool.

27:46.538 --> 27:49.540
- I am kidding. Geez.
- Funny.

27:49.541 --> 27:54.579
Hey, um, we better go.
It's kind of a long drive.

27:54.580 --> 27:56.681
- Go ahead.
- We got it covered here.

27:56.682 --> 27:59.016
- Nice meeting you, Nora.
- Come back anytime.

27:59.017 --> 28:01.085
- I'm gonna remember that.
- Thanks, Bunny.

28:02.154 --> 28:07.258
You're a stand-up gal. and, Benjamin,
good luck with that baby.

28:07.259 --> 28:10.194
And good luck telling your
girlfriend about that baby.

28:10.195 --> 28:12.830
- Thank you.
- And good luck to you in...

28:14.166 --> 28:19.537
- uh, at your new place.
- Thanks.

28:19.538 --> 28:22.240
I'm just gonna go upstairs
and get my stuff.

28:26.678 --> 28:28.112
Are you gonna be able
to do this?

28:28.113 --> 28:31.149
I've been doing this
for one or the other parents

28:31.150 --> 28:34.419
since I was a kid.
I'll be fine.

28:34.420 --> 28:36.587
You can't break the law.
That's the bottom line.

28:36.588 --> 28:40.758
- You can't break the law.
If there weren't laws,
I'd be dead by now.

28:44.363 --> 28:46.230
I'll see you tomorrow.

28:46.231 --> 28:48.800
- No, you won't.
- Um, tomorrow's my big day.

28:48.801 --> 28:51.702
- It'll be fine. It's Amy.
- Yeah. Amy.

28:51.703 --> 28:55.273
Hey, how'd you rather be taking
your own mother back to prison?

28:55.274 --> 28:58.843
- I don't think so. See you.
- Good luck.

29:05.284 --> 29:06.818
Come in.

29:08.821 --> 29:11.956
- Madison.
-  Lauren.

29:14.460 --> 29:19.130
- Hey, nice.
- Yeah, it is nice.

29:19.131 --> 29:22.133
Oh, I parked down
by the firehouse.
I hope
that's far enough away.

29:22.134 --> 29:24.669
Yeah, that should do it. I just
wanted you to see the place.

29:24.670 --> 29:28.206
Yeah. Well, dude, you need to let these
people know you're staying here soon

29:28.207 --> 29:29.474
'cause I don't think
anyone else

29:29.475 --> 29:34.245
is gonna walk 5 miles
just to get here.
I just did it
because Lauren made me.

29:34.246 --> 29:37.915
And now she wants me
back at her house.
Geez.

29:37.916 --> 29:42.253
Yeah, I want to tell them-
Grace's mom and her husband-
but Tom wants me to wait.

29:42.254 --> 29:43.921
He's afraid
they'll kick me out.

29:43.922 --> 29:45.923
He's not used to the place yet.
He still thinks it's haunted.

29:48.427 --> 29:50.661
Oh, those two need to make up.

29:50.662 --> 29:53.798
I don't have
an unlimited text plan.
My parents won't let me.

29:53.799 --> 29:56.334
They think I'd text too much,
and I would.

29:56.335 --> 29:59.136
And I don't want to be Lauren's
girlfriend and her boyfriend.

29:59.137 --> 30:01.739
No, no, no. You don't want her
to make up with Madison yet.

30:01.740 --> 30:04.842
If Lauren doesn't have
Madison to talk to, you're gonna
get a lot of action.

30:04.843 --> 30:06.744
- We both are.
- Oh.

30:06.745 --> 30:09.146
I should've know.
You have an ulterior motive.

30:09.147 --> 30:11.649
I'm just taking advantage
of the situation.

30:11.650 --> 30:13.751
I'm a "glass is half full"
kind of a guy. All right.

30:13.752 --> 30:16.220
I'd love to stay and hang out
where you're not wanted,

30:16.221 --> 30:20.691
but Lauren is now insisting
I leave, right now.
Hey, then go, buddy.

30:23.829 --> 30:27.164
"Buddy"? What's up
with this guy?

30:27.165 --> 30:30.701
Jesse, Tom.
Tom, Jesse.
Don't bother.

30:30.702 --> 30:34.305
I don't wanna meet your fans.
You know why?

30:34.306 --> 30:40.778
Because you're
no friend of mine.
Nice meeting you.

30:42.781 --> 30:45.216
I failed the drug test.

30:45.217 --> 30:48.953
- Oh, I forgot
you had that today.
- I failed the drug test!

30:48.954 --> 30:51.455
I'm sorry about that, Tom.
I really, really am.

30:51.456 --> 30:54.725
The job was mine,
but I failed the drug test.

30:54.726 --> 30:56.527
Is there any way
they'll let you take it again?

30:56.528 --> 31:00.231
- No, there isn't, Jack.
- Oh. Hi, Mrs. uh-

31:00.232 --> 31:01.732
- Zegay.
- Zegay.

31:01.733 --> 31:04.168
- How do you spell that?
- T-S-E...

31:04.169 --> 31:08.506
- Never mind.
- So, Jack, uh,
you're living here,

31:08.507 --> 31:11.542
- and you gave Tom
pot brownies?
- He did.

31:11.543 --> 31:15.613
No, I didn't. I- I mean,
I didn't mean to.

31:15.614 --> 31:18.950
- It wasn't my fault,
honest.
- They were in the freezer,

31:18.951 --> 31:22.753
and we were hungry,
and I didn't know.
I swear. Did you know
you were living here?

31:23.855 --> 31:28.159
Kind of.
I mean, temporarily, till you
say I can't live here.

31:28.160 --> 31:31.729
- Jack, I told you
you can't live here.
- You  said I couldn't live in the house.

31:31.730 --> 31:34.298
But Tom really wanted me
to move into the guest house,

31:34.299 --> 31:37.268
and he said we were gonna tell
you when the time was right.

31:37.269 --> 31:39.236
This wasn't
the right time, Tom.

31:39.237 --> 31:41.839
Yeah. The right time
would've been when you moved in,

31:41.840 --> 31:44.675
- or better,
before you moved in.
- And you should've asked.

31:44.676 --> 31:48.546
- I should have.
I'm sorry, Mom.
- No, no, no.

31:48.547 --> 31:50.548
You are not gonna
get away with this anymore-

31:50.549 --> 31:52.850
doing whatever you want
and then apologizing.

31:52.851 --> 31:54.785
Tom, you knew this was wrong.

31:54.786 --> 31:56.587
Now, you may not have known
about the brownies,

31:56.588 --> 31:57.922
but you knew this was wrong.

31:57.923 --> 32:00.224
And now, everyone knows
about the pot brownies.

32:00.225 --> 32:04.895
Yes, they do.
At least everyone
in the courthouse.

32:04.896 --> 32:10.067
Oh, geez.
I didn't even think about that.
It's not a good group
to know about this.

32:10.068 --> 32:12.336
Should I go tell someone?
And tell them what?

32:12.337 --> 32:15.172
It was an accident? No. I think
we'd better leave well enough alone.

32:15.173 --> 32:16.941
Can I just stay here then?

32:16.942 --> 32:20.311
- Do you have
any other options, Jack?
- Not really.

32:20.312 --> 32:23.948
All right. Well, I'm not gonna
put you out on the street.

32:23.949 --> 32:26.784
So, I guess we'll just see
how things go.

32:26.785 --> 32:28.886
And I gotta talk to Grace first
to see how she feels.

32:28.887 --> 32:32.256
She knows.
Grace knows?
She didn't eat
any of the brownies.

32:32.257 --> 32:37.261
She has no excuse.
She should've told you.

32:37.262 --> 32:40.231
Yeah, she should've told me,
and you should've told me,

32:40.232 --> 32:44.268
and you should've told me.
But you didn't.
So we'll deal with it.

32:44.269 --> 32:47.738
All right. Well, I guess we'll see
you at dinner, Jack. Yes, ma'am.

32:47.739 --> 32:50.641
And after dinner, I want you to help Tom
go through the want ads to find another job.

32:50.642 --> 32:51.575
Yes, ma'am.

32:54.179 --> 32:56.981
Oh, and I take it you threw away
the rest of the brownies?

32:56.982 --> 32:59.884
Yes, ma'am.

33:01.253 --> 33:03.387
I really wanted that job.

33:03.388 --> 33:05.489
I know, and I'm really
sorry about that, Tom,

33:05.490 --> 33:10.227
but the good news is
we're roommates.
She said, "We'll see. "

33:10.228 --> 33:12.229
Yeah, well, at least
no one went to jail, right?

33:32.084 --> 33:38.689
Thanks for the use
of the car this morning.
Here's the key
to the safety deposit box.

33:39.925 --> 33:42.326
If, you know...
Just in case.

33:45.430 --> 33:49.867
All right, then.
You sure
you don't want to go in?

33:51.937 --> 33:55.706
Yeah. I'm sure.
Yeah.

33:55.707 --> 34:01.612
Oh, and here.
This is-
This is for you.

34:01.613 --> 34:06.150
Go ahead. Take it.
Did wonders for me.

34:06.151 --> 34:08.385
How can you make jokes
at a time like this?

34:08.386 --> 34:13.724
I don't know.
Maybe it's because,

34:13.725 --> 34:18.395
for once, I'm not
thinking about myself.
I'm thinking about you.

34:18.396 --> 34:21.098
I'm gonna be thinking
about you every day...

34:21.099 --> 34:24.235
for a while, so...

34:25.637 --> 34:28.606
Well, you know
where to find me.

34:31.275 --> 34:33.577
I know where to find you.

34:35.781 --> 34:40.751
Um, maybe you can send me
some pictures of John,
please?

34:44.688 --> 34:48.292
All right, then.
Yeah, I should go.

34:50.762 --> 34:53.797
I'm gonna learn
to speak Vietnamese.

34:53.799 --> 34:56.132
You really should have
a goal when you're in there.

34:56.134 --> 35:00.671
You know, something to do.
Vietnamese.

35:02.874 --> 35:05.042
All right. I'm going.

35:09.314 --> 35:11.382
Bye.

35:26.998 --> 35:27.932
Mom!

35:31.102 --> 35:32.369
Mom!

35:42.113 --> 35:47.184
It'll be fine, Ricky.
Okay? It'll be fine.

36:20.126 --> 36:22.460
Hi.

36:22.495 --> 36:25.664
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

36:25.698 --> 36:27.465
Well, I talked to Amy.

36:27.500 --> 36:29.000
- And?
- Oh, I didn't tell her.

36:29.035 --> 36:32.504
Ben called last night, and he
asked that none of us tell her.

36:32.538 --> 36:35.473
- He's going there today.
- To New York?

36:35.508 --> 36:39.644
I guess that's better than
a phone call or a text message.
Yeah, I guess.

36:39.679 --> 36:42.948
Maybe at some point, someone could
take John to New York to see her.

36:42.982 --> 36:45.016
That'd make her feel better,
I think.

36:45.051 --> 36:48.954
- Someone like Ricky?
- You're thinking Ricky should go?

36:48.988 --> 36:52.724
Ashley, come on.
You and Ricky?
Me and Ricky what?

36:52.758 --> 36:56.461
How do you really feel
about him?
Just tell me.
No judgment. Promise.

36:58.264 --> 37:03.168
I like him.
I think maybe
I more than like him.

37:04.403 --> 37:08.940
I think maybe I love him.
Okay.

37:10.443 --> 37:13.044
And do you think that he
feels the same way about you?

37:13.079 --> 37:14.779
I don't know.

37:21.854 --> 37:24.723
Okay, Ashley.

37:24.757 --> 37:27.158
Here's the tough thing
about relationships.

37:27.193 --> 37:32.998
Sometimes,
you have to let your head
overrule your heart.

37:33.032 --> 37:36.968
Sometimes, even though
you think you're in love,
you have to take a step back

37:37.003 --> 37:42.140
and think about
whether or not this love

37:42.174 --> 37:47.279
is really to your benefit.
Do you really think
that it's the best thing

37:47.313 --> 37:48.747
for you to be
in love with Ricky?

37:48.781 --> 37:51.116
I thought you said
in matters of the heart,

37:51.150 --> 37:53.084
you should decide
with the heart.

37:53.119 --> 37:55.587
That's what you said the last time
the two of us talked about boys.

37:55.621 --> 37:57.022
When was that?

37:57.680 --> 38:02.380
- Third grade.
- Oh, right. Dwayne.

38:03.462 --> 38:05.463
Oh, such a nice boy.

38:05.498 --> 38:07.966
And Ricky's not,
so you're changing your advice?

38:08.000 --> 38:11.169
No, I'm changing my advice
because you're older now.

38:11.203 --> 38:16.174
You're not
a little girl anymore.
And Ricky's certainly
no third-grader.

38:17.944 --> 38:22.047
You have to think, Ashley,
as well as feel.

38:22.081 --> 38:24.249
In fact, sometimes,
you can think about the way

38:24.283 --> 38:27.052
that you want to feel
and feel that way.

38:28.821 --> 38:30.689
You can.
You really can.

38:33.559 --> 38:35.927
Hey. Do you need
a ride to school?

38:35.962 --> 38:39.531
Yeah, she does.
Thanks, Ricky.

38:43.970 --> 38:49.374
Have a nice day.
Look, we need to talk.

38:49.408 --> 38:53.078
No, we don't.
That's the beauty
of being friends.

38:53.112 --> 38:56.381
We don't have to talk at all.
"Friends"?

38:56.415 --> 39:00.185
For now, okay?
Now would be perfect.

39:00.219 --> 39:03.321
What's wrong?
Uh, my mom came to visit.

39:03.356 --> 39:04.990
Not my foster mom,
my birth mom.

39:05.024 --> 39:06.558
Really?
And you didn't call me?

39:06.592 --> 39:09.861
No, she was at my place.
I'll tell you
about it in the car.

39:09.895 --> 39:12.664
Did you hear Ben's going
to New York? Yeah, I heard.

39:12.698 --> 39:14.399
Come on.

39:30.449 --> 39:35.220
You know
what you're gonna say?
Yeah. I'm, uh-
I'm gonna tell her

39:35.254 --> 39:38.256
what I told you I'm gonna tell
her when we were on the plane.

39:38.290 --> 39:41.092
Okay, give it to me again.
Dad-
No, no. Really.

39:41.127 --> 39:42.761
The more times
you say it to me,

39:42.795 --> 39:44.729
the easier it'll be
when you have to say it to her.

39:44.764 --> 39:46.765
Dad, please. I already feel
like I'm gonna throw up.

39:46.799 --> 39:50.168
There's no throwing up. You're
a grown-up. Now go ahead.

39:50.202 --> 39:55.774
I love you.
I've loved you
from the first time I saw you.

39:55.808 --> 39:57.675
And ever since then,

39:57.710 --> 40:00.412
we've been through
a lot together, and yet-

40:00.446 --> 40:03.448
Don't pause here.
Drive it through.
Keep going.

40:03.482 --> 40:07.185
And yet...
Darn. What was it?

40:07.219 --> 40:09.954
"You and I have been through
a lot together,

40:09.989 --> 40:13.491
"and yet our problems seem
to have made us stronger.

40:13.526 --> 40:16.294
We've grown up a lot
since we first met. "

40:16.328 --> 40:18.063
I'll take it from there.

40:19.432 --> 40:24.803
Oh, no.
All right.
Stay strong,

40:24.837 --> 40:27.405
keep your mood up,
and don't slouch.

40:27.440 --> 40:32.811
Ben!
Hi.

40:32.845 --> 40:35.613
I can't believe you're here. I
can't believe I'm here, either.

40:35.648 --> 40:38.216
Don't you love it? This is so
exciting. Hi, Mr. Boykewich.

40:38.250 --> 40:40.585
Hi, Amy.
Uh, you look beautiful.

40:40.619 --> 40:43.721
Doesn't she look beautiful, Ben?
New York's been good for you.

40:43.756 --> 40:46.191
Thank you.
You really
do look beautiful.

40:46.225 --> 40:50.028
Have you gotten taller?
No. I don't-
I don't think I'm taller.

40:51.330 --> 40:54.399
Uh, I'm gonna go in
and get us a table

40:54.433 --> 40:58.536
and a drink,
and I'll see you inside.
All right.

41:06.946 --> 41:12.004
Amy, Adrian's pregnant,
and it's my baby.
Oh, God.

41:13.919 --> 41:17.589
It wasn't supposed to come
out like that. Wait- Wait-

41:17.623 --> 41:20.058
Amy, I love you.

41:20.092 --> 41:24.462
I've loved you
since the first time I saw you.
Adrian's pregnant?

41:24.497 --> 41:27.065
And since that time, we've
been through a lot together.

41:27.099 --> 41:28.733
What- What are you
talking about?

41:28.767 --> 41:30.668
Our- Our problems
have only made us stronger,

41:30.703 --> 41:34.472
and we've grown up a lot since then
- Ben, stop!

41:35.608 --> 41:37.542
Is this why
you came out here?

41:37.576 --> 41:39.878
To tell me tt Adrian's
pregnant with your baby?

41:39.912 --> 41:43.448
I wanted to talk to you
face to face.
Why? So you can remember

41:43.482 --> 41:45.550
what my face looked like
the last time you see me?

41:45.584 --> 41:47.886
Amy, I don't want
to marry Adrian.

41:47.920 --> 41:50.421
I'm not going to marry Adrian.
She's actually having the baby?

41:50.456 --> 41:52.757
She is actually
having my baby.

41:54.527 --> 41:57.128
But that doesn't have to
change anything between us.

41:58.531 --> 42:00.365
Let- Let's just-
We'll go in there.

42:00.399 --> 42:02.734
Let's have dinner, and
we'll talk about- No. No, no-

42:02.768 --> 42:06.237
We're- We're not
gonna do that.
But I came
all this way to see you.

42:06.272 --> 42:09.574
And I have
a calculus test tomorrow.
I don't know why I said that.

42:09.608 --> 42:12.177
Do you like pecan pie?
They have great pecan pie here.

42:12.211 --> 42:14.212
Who cares what I think
of pecan pie?

42:14.246 --> 42:17.081
wait, Wait.

42:28.661 --> 42:31.729
It's what I said.
She's angry.

42:31.764 --> 42:37.302
But you did the right thing
by coming here and telling her.
Now you wait.

42:40.806 --> 42:43.308
Did you tell her
about the pie?

42:47.713 --> 42:49.147
Come on.
