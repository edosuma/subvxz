00:23.557 --> 00:25.393
<i>Previously on</i> Ghost...

00:25.426 --> 00:26.394
Yas!

00:26.427 --> 00:27.595
I was trying to make breakfast.

00:27.628 --> 00:30.030
Really, little girl?
I'm going back to sleep.

00:30.064 --> 00:31.232
She been drinking again, Yas?

00:31.265 --> 00:32.366
She's getting worse, 'Riq.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.534
How can I fix this?

00:33.567 --> 00:34.735
Besides working the steps,

00:34.769 --> 00:37.037
stay away from him as much as possible.

00:37.071 --> 00:38.773
<i>Professor Jabari
Reynolds from Stansfield.</i>

00:38.806 --> 00:40.341
- No.
- From your reaction,

00:40.374 --> 00:42.109
it feels like there might be
something more between you.

00:42.143 --> 00:43.144
In the past, there was.

00:43.177 --> 00:44.378
- Not currently?
- No.

00:44.412 --> 00:46.080
<i>Back in fucking business.</i>

00:46.113 --> 00:47.448
All right, we'll park this
at my parents' country house

00:47.481 --> 00:49.150
until we figure out a plan
and move all this product.

00:49.183 --> 00:50.718
- The 12th District.
- Sweeney's seat?

00:50.751 --> 00:52.520
That guy's a Democratic legend. No.

00:52.553 --> 00:55.055
Promise me when I bring
something back on Sweeney,

00:55.089 --> 00:56.323
you'll bless my taking his seat.

00:56.357 --> 00:58.225
I got a plan for us
to get out of the life.

00:58.259 --> 00:59.760
I'm telling Zeke to sign up
for the draft this year.

00:59.794 --> 01:00.694
<i>It's time for you to go pro.</i>

01:00.728 --> 01:02.196
I just don't know if it's gonna be--

01:02.229 --> 01:03.197
Enough of this Carrie shit.

01:03.230 --> 01:04.532
We got some unfinished business.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.066
Kill him.

01:06.100 --> 01:07.234
I don't got shit
to prove to you, huh?

01:07.268 --> 01:08.369
But that's who I motherfucking am.

01:08.402 --> 01:09.804
<i>Ain't nobody more vicious
or loyal than me.</i>

01:09.837 --> 01:11.238
Give me a shot.

01:11.272 --> 01:12.506
We need to talk, okay?
I got us a new connect.

01:12.540 --> 01:13.741
Ma, don't walk away. Ma.

01:13.774 --> 01:14.742
My number's in here.

01:14.775 --> 01:16.644
If anything happens, use it.

01:21.315 --> 01:23.150
C'mon, Ma. Reach out.

01:24.852 --> 01:26.353

01:26.387 --> 01:27.354

01:27.388 --> 01:28.522
- Shit.
- Did you get that?

01:28.556 --> 01:29.723
The phone pinged at Stansfield.

01:29.757 --> 01:31.492
That's where we focus this investigation,

01:31.525 --> 01:33.828

04:03.777 --> 04:05.679
Tariq St. Patrick, go and grab your shoes.

04:05.713 --> 04:06.880
We need to bring you down to the station.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.649
Station? For what?

04:08.682 --> 04:09.817
You'll find out when you get there.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.356
These my two shits right here, pendejos.

04:15.389 --> 04:16.790
Which one you think
I should fuck up first?

04:16.824 --> 04:19.393
The fuck you need the Internet
to tell you that for?

04:19.426 --> 04:20.761
What, you never heard of democracy?

04:23.297 --> 04:24.798
Hey, yo, snap this shit.

04:26.467 --> 04:27.735
Fuck outta here. I'm out.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.003
- You out?
- Yeah.

04:29.036 --> 04:30.604
Where you going? Who was that?

04:30.638 --> 04:31.705
No one.

04:35.476 --> 04:38.278
Simon. So glad you reached out.

04:39.446 --> 04:40.681
Well, I have a small problem,

04:40.714 --> 04:43.817
and I think you might be the solution.

04:43.851 --> 04:46.353
Actually, ditto.

04:46.387 --> 04:48.689
What do you know about
Congressman Rick Sweeney?

04:48.722 --> 04:50.290
I'd like to make a run at his seat,

04:50.324 --> 04:52.059
but I'm gonna need
some help with the DNC--

04:52.292 --> 04:54.895
That's nice, but I have another idea.

04:54.928 --> 04:58.298
Stansfield is having a bit
of a publicity problem,

04:58.332 --> 05:00.067
what with the recent murders and all,

05:00.300 --> 05:02.670
and you coming on as an adjunct

05:02.703 --> 05:05.739
could be a very good look for all sides.

05:05.773 --> 05:08.509
You know, I really think
that uh, my efforts--

05:08.542 --> 05:10.511
No one is talking about you, Rashad.

05:10.544 --> 05:12.713
You need headlines,
and this is a great one.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.648
Plus, what better place to dig up

05:14.682 --> 05:15.949
helpful dirt on Sweeney?

05:15.983 --> 05:17.384
You know he's friends with the Westons,

05:17.418 --> 05:20.087
who built the other half
of Stansfield's Campus.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.755
<i>And your colleagues.</i>

05:21.789 --> 05:22.856
<i>Do me a favor and look up</i>

05:22.890 --> 05:24.892
the Canonical Studies Department.

05:31.799 --> 05:33.067
Damn.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.436
I really think you'll enjoy the view

05:35.469 --> 05:36.670
from the classroom, Rashad.

05:38.405 --> 05:42.076
Oh, Simon. You know me so well.

05:48.482 --> 05:50.384
- Tariq.
- Yas.

05:50.417 --> 05:52.920
What are you doing here?
What happened? Where's Grandma?

05:52.953 --> 05:54.555
Back there.
<i>Thanks, Justine.</i>

05:54.588 --> 05:55.789
Listen, I'm gonna try and make it

05:55.823 --> 05:58.892
less than a year next time, okay?

05:58.926 --> 06:02.096
- The fuck are you doing here?
- Tariq. Hi.

06:02.129 --> 06:05.065
Davis MacLean sent me.
We, uh, work together now.

06:06.133 --> 06:07.868
Your grandmother got a DWI tonight,

06:07.901 --> 06:11.371
and Davis asked me to come down
and grease the wheels a bit.

06:11.405 --> 06:13.674
Everyone's okay.
She just hit a parked car.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.776
But she's gonna be here a while.

06:17.411 --> 06:19.680
Listen, I can--I can get you
a few minutes with her

06:19.713 --> 06:21.081
while they process the case.

06:24.017 --> 06:25.152
Thanks.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.890
I'll be back, okay? A few minutes.

06:40.033 --> 06:42.136
Tariq, I- I wasn't drunk.

06:42.169 --> 06:45.439
Big Mama, how could you do this
with Yasmine in the car?

06:45.472 --> 06:47.641
I mean, don't you know what
could have happened to her?

06:47.674 --> 06:49.409
It wasn't my fault.

06:49.443 --> 06:51.512
Your sister was supposed
to have a sleepover.

06:51.545 --> 06:53.147
I was supposed to have the night off.

06:53.180 --> 06:54.715
Grandma, they are no nights off.

06:54.748 --> 06:55.883
You're telling me!

06:55.916 --> 06:59.653
I am 62 years old, and I am tired.

06:59.686 --> 07:01.989
Do you know what I've been through?

07:02.022 --> 07:06.827
First Raina, then your father,
now my daughter's gone.

07:06.860 --> 07:10.464
Sometimes it gets to be too much.

07:10.497 --> 07:14.902
I should be allowed to have
a drink or two if I want.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.703
You're right, Grandma.

07:16.737 --> 07:19.072
You're right. I'm sorry, okay?

07:19.106 --> 07:20.641
Sorry to interrupt,

07:20.674 --> 07:22.576
but uh, Yasmine's getting ready
to leave for a foster home

07:22.609 --> 07:23.811
- if you--
<i>Wait, what?</i>

07:23.844 --> 07:25.512
- Foster care?
- No, no, she's coming with me.

07:25.546 --> 07:26.980
I understand you wanting to do that,

07:27.014 --> 07:28.816
but she's not allowed
to return to Estelle's

07:28.849 --> 07:30.551
until after her court appearance tomorrow,

07:30.584 --> 07:33.787
and a college dorm isn't
acceptable accommodations.

07:36.757 --> 07:38.091
<i>I don't wanna go with her.</i>

07:38.125 --> 07:39.593
I wanna go with you, Tariq.

07:39.626 --> 07:40.861
Listen, Yas, I know. I know.

07:40.894 --> 07:42.229
I wish you could, but you can't right now.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.131
No, please Tariq. Let me come with you.

07:44.164 --> 07:45.499
I'll be good. I promise.

07:45.532 --> 07:46.867
Yasmin, listen, you're always good.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.502
All right? That's not the problem.

07:48.535 --> 07:49.770
It's just for the night, though, okay?

07:49.803 --> 07:52.105
Just go with the lady, Yas.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.941
She's going to a really good home.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.776
<i>I've known the family for years.</i>

07:55.809 --> 07:57.778
I'm her family, all right?

07:59.246 --> 08:01.915
Look, Yas, I'ma fix it, okay?

08:01.949 --> 08:05.152
I promise. I promise.

08:05.185 --> 08:06.553

you be doing.

08:33.547 --> 08:35.182

Been in the game since before I was born.

<i>she been thinking she been

09:12.653 --> 09:14.288

09:15.923 --> 09:17.624
<i>Hmm.</i>

09:17.658 --> 09:20.327

09:23.764 --> 09:25.899

You want a fucking book report?

09:26.967 --> 09:28.669
Yeah.

09:30.837 --> 09:32.739
My mom's been trying
to get him out for a minute,

09:32.773 --> 09:35.709
but my pop's not coming home.

09:35.742 --> 09:36.810
Hmm.

09:36.843 --> 09:40.580
As long as she's feeling herself,

09:40.614 --> 09:42.149
got to make it on my own.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.952
Yeah, well, at some point,

09:44.985 --> 09:47.287
we all gotta forge our own path.

09:47.321 --> 09:50.290
The most important thing is
knowing who your people are.

09:50.324 --> 09:52.025
Blood, chosen family,

09:52.059 --> 09:54.995
the only thing that matters
is who has got your back

09:55.028 --> 09:56.797
when it's up against the fucking wall.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.999
Facts. Gotta stay true
to the ones who got you there.

09:59.032 --> 10:03.236
Mm-hmm.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.272
I'ma give you a trial run.

10:07.174 --> 10:09.376
Yo, what the fuck is he doing here?

10:09.609 --> 10:11.178
You told him you were coming?

10:11.211 --> 10:12.846
I didn't tell him shit.

10:12.879 --> 10:14.214
I swear he must have followed me here.

10:14.247 --> 10:16.216
Ahh, fuck.

10:16.249 --> 10:19.619
Yeah, send him up.

10:28.195 --> 10:30.797
Oh, hell yeah. This shit lit as fuck.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.132
<i>Where y'all niggas at?</i>

10:32.165 --> 10:33.333
We over here on the 59th floor, baby--

10:34.868 --> 10:36.336
Hey, man, put that shit down.

10:36.370 --> 10:39.139
Why would you ever want a public record

10:39.172 --> 10:41.308
of every place you've ever been?

10:41.341 --> 10:43.677
Hmm?

10:43.710 --> 10:44.878
Chef.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.221
Hey, man, I ain't mean no disrespect.

10:54.254 --> 10:55.989
Yo, Mecca, we just here
to get your product

10:56.023 --> 10:57.991
out in these streets, you feel me?

11:02.229 --> 11:03.663
What did I tell you

11:03.697 --> 11:05.065
about being aware of your surroundings?

11:08.201 --> 11:10.203
<i>You know, there is
a power vacuum in New York</i>

11:10.237 --> 11:12.439
right now that I am trying to step into.

11:14.241 --> 11:15.909
But I need a real organization to do that.

11:15.942 --> 11:16.977
<i>Stop! Stop! Stop!</i>

11:17.010 --> 11:18.245
This street clown is no good to me,

11:18.278 --> 11:20.013
and neither are you if you don't know

11:20.047 --> 11:21.815
what company to keep.

11:25.852 --> 11:27.788
<i>I was wrong about you.</i>

11:27.821 --> 11:29.689
You're not ready for this shit.

11:29.723 --> 11:30.791
Get the fuck out.

11:33.427 --> 11:35.228
Take this bitch and get
the fuck out of my house.

11:35.262 --> 11:37.798
<i>Oh, God. God.</i>

11:42.836 --> 11:43.970
C'mon, man.

11:50.077 --> 11:51.912
Yo, why the fuck is Saxe working here?

11:51.945 --> 11:54.314
Look, I understand your hesitation,

11:54.347 --> 11:55.816
given your history with him,

11:55.849 --> 11:57.451
but Saxe brings a certain skill set

11:57.484 --> 12:01.021
that can help all the clients
at this firm, including you.

12:03.190 --> 12:05.225
Ah. Good news.

12:05.258 --> 12:07.094
I got Estelle a DAT.

12:07.127 --> 12:09.729
On a DWI? How'd you pull that off?

12:09.763 --> 12:11.264
Fuck is a DAT?

12:11.298 --> 12:12.732
Desk appearance ticket.

12:12.766 --> 12:15.102
That means instead of being
held in custody

12:15.135 --> 12:16.736
waiting to see a judge,

12:16.770 --> 12:18.338
she'll be sent home until her hearing

12:18.371 --> 12:19.473
at a future date.

12:19.506 --> 12:20.507
Great work, Saxe.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.008
I promise you, Tariq,

12:22.042 --> 12:24.444
this is the best possible
outcome in this situation.

12:24.478 --> 12:27.114
Yeah, not so big
on your promises, you know?

12:27.147 --> 12:28.181
<i>He's right, Tariq.</i>

12:28.215 --> 12:29.382
As much as I hate to say it,

12:29.416 --> 12:31.751
even I couldn't have pulled that off.

12:31.785 --> 12:34.988
Oh, sometimes you just need a white guy.

12:35.021 --> 12:37.858
Thank you, though I-- I do wanna point out

12:37.891 --> 12:39.092
that I'm in the minority here,

12:39.126 --> 12:41.428
so I think that counts
as a microaggression.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.363
Uh, could you give us a second?

12:43.396 --> 12:46.099
- Yeah.
- Yep.

12:46.133 --> 12:48.034
- Door?
- Uh, yeah.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.369
Thank you.

12:49.402 --> 12:51.071
<i>I don't trust him, a'ight?</i>

12:51.104 --> 12:52.472
A'ight, you don't know him
like I know him.

12:52.506 --> 12:54.407
He's not doing this shit
out the goodness of his heart.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.276
Okay, look, kid.

12:56.309 --> 12:57.978
<i>I'm gonna let you in on a secret.</i>

12:59.146 --> 13:01.381
Neither am I.

13:01.414 --> 13:04.017
I mean, you pay, we play.

13:04.050 --> 13:05.552
Okay. So I pay you.

13:05.785 --> 13:08.388
You find my sister so I can
bring her home, simple as that.

13:08.421 --> 13:11.358
Okay, I'm sorry, but that I can't do.

13:11.391 --> 13:13.160
<i>Yasmine stays in the system</i>

13:13.193 --> 13:15.162
<i>at least until your grandmother's hearing.</i>

13:15.195 --> 13:17.264
Unfortunately, I won't be much help

13:17.297 --> 13:18.932
in the family court system.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.433
Outside my reach.

13:20.467 --> 13:23.403
<i>For that,</i>

13:23.436 --> 13:27.407
money and someone with a lot of influence.

13:30.944 --> 13:33.813
Caridad Milgram. Hey there. I'm Rashad--

13:33.847 --> 13:36.349
Rashad Tate. I know.

13:36.383 --> 13:38.051
That's your office,
but the police are still

13:38.084 --> 13:40.153
using it for interviews.

13:40.187 --> 13:42.355
Not exactly the welcome I was expecting.

13:42.389 --> 13:43.557
If you don't mind me saying so,

13:43.590 --> 13:46.259
your pictures don't do you justice.

13:46.293 --> 13:47.928
You are absolutely stunning.

13:47.961 --> 13:51.164
I do mind, and I'm not
your welcoming committee.

13:51.198 --> 13:52.866
You're not even a literature professor.

13:52.899 --> 13:54.100
Well, it's my understanding

13:54.134 --> 13:57.103
that we'll be co-teaching
an ethics course.

13:58.405 --> 14:01.041
And you think
you're more qualified for that?

14:01.074 --> 14:02.609
<i>You know, I know what this is.</i>

14:02.842 --> 14:04.110
They think they can just swap out

14:04.144 --> 14:05.879
one high-profile Black man for another,

14:05.912 --> 14:08.048
- and no one will notice.
- Now, Caridad--

14:08.081 --> 14:09.983
It's Professor Milgram.

14:11.318 --> 14:12.519
Duly noted.

14:12.552 --> 14:15.522
You know, maybe it's best you just observe

14:15.555 --> 14:16.957
today's debate on altruism.

14:30.503 --> 14:32.872
Hannah Roth, Detective Kevin Whitman.

14:32.906 --> 14:35.175
NYPD. Can I talk to you?

14:35.208 --> 14:36.409
About what?

14:36.443 --> 14:39.045
How do you know Caridad Milgram?

14:39.079 --> 14:40.413
Why?

14:40.447 --> 14:42.082
Well, I've gone through her phone records,

14:42.115 --> 14:43.984
and it looks like she calls you
multiple times a week.

14:44.017 --> 14:47.487
I'm gonna ask you again.
What is your relationship?

14:47.520 --> 14:49.256
Ma'am.

14:51.258 --> 14:52.993
Ma'am, if you and Ms. Milgram are involved

14:53.026 --> 14:54.294
in some sort of criminal activity--

14:54.327 --> 14:57.097
Criminal activity? No, no, no, no.

14:57.130 --> 14:59.299
It's nothing like that.

14:59.332 --> 15:01.101
I'm her sponsor, okay?

15:01.134 --> 15:03.103
And anything Carrie shares with me

15:03.136 --> 15:04.571
is personal and confidential.

15:04.604 --> 15:07.140
Legal privilege
and confidentiality protections

15:07.173 --> 15:08.608
do not extend to 12-step meetings

15:08.642 --> 15:10.243
and sponsor interactions, Ms. Roth.

15:10.277 --> 15:11.578
Look, I can take you down to a grand jury

15:11.611 --> 15:13.046
and have you speak to them,

15:13.079 --> 15:15.382
or you can answer my questions right here.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.384
Shall I go on?

15:20.487 --> 15:22.656
Fine.

15:22.689 --> 15:26.126
Tell me about her relationship
with Jabari Reynolds.

15:29.596 --> 15:32.299
I just wanna thank y'all
for coming out today.

15:32.332 --> 15:35.368
Like Coach said,
um, I'm grateful for the time

15:35.402 --> 15:36.936
I got to play here at Stansfield.

15:38.538 --> 15:39.606
And I'm blessed to announce

15:39.639 --> 15:42.709
that I will be entering
the NBA draft this year.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.345
Have you hired an agent yet, Zeke?

15:45.378 --> 15:46.713
I'm still looking at my options.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.214
Does this choice have anything to do

15:48.248 --> 15:50.050
with the off-court issues
that caused you to miss

15:50.083 --> 15:51.184
the beginning of the season?

15:51.217 --> 15:52.185
Not at all.

15:52.218 --> 15:53.453
I put those issues behind me,

15:53.486 --> 15:56.056
and I'm 100% focused on playing ball.

15:56.089 --> 15:57.123
<i>Yes, he is!</i>

15:57.157 --> 15:58.325
Thank y'all.

16:01.194 --> 16:04.364
Plenty of time for that later. Thank you.

16:04.397 --> 16:06.333
You think I'm ready for all this, Auntie?

16:06.366 --> 16:08.268
You gotta be, because it's happening.

16:08.301 --> 16:11.004
Don't forget you're a target now, Zeke.

16:11.037 --> 16:12.739
Everybody and they mother
gonna want something from you,

16:12.972 --> 16:14.507
especially women.

16:14.541 --> 16:15.709
Now remember, I'm the only one

16:15.742 --> 16:18.311
with your best interest at heart.

16:18.345 --> 16:20.347
Now, are you sure
all those off-the-court issues

16:20.380 --> 16:22.182
are behind you?

16:24.751 --> 16:28.388
I don't wanna pledge Kappa!

16:28.421 --> 16:30.156
Fuck. Fine, Trace, I'll be there.

16:30.190 --> 16:33.026
Go get your gold fucking star from Dad.

16:33.059 --> 16:35.028
Yeah, you're a fucking asshole.

16:35.061 --> 16:36.363
I gotta go.

16:38.531 --> 16:41.101
what the fuck, bro?
Where the fuck were you, Tariq?

16:41.134 --> 16:43.069
I was taking care of family shit.

16:43.103 --> 16:44.270
You move the product?

16:44.304 --> 16:46.339
Yeah, I moved it,
to my parents' garage uptown

16:46.373 --> 16:48.074
in my trunk.

16:48.108 --> 16:49.409
What the fuck did you just tell me, B?

16:49.442 --> 16:50.510
What do you mean
it's in your trunk--

16:50.543 --> 16:51.711
Chill out, bro, that place is, like,

16:51.745 --> 16:53.380
more secure than the fucking White House.

16:53.413 --> 16:54.481
And what'd you expect me to do?

16:54.514 --> 16:56.549
I made a fucking executive decision.

16:56.583 --> 16:58.618
Listen, bro.

16:58.651 --> 17:00.520
A'ight, my grandma, she caught a DWI.

17:00.553 --> 17:02.555
A'ight, I had to take care of
some shit for my little sister,

17:02.589 --> 17:03.790
so, you know, I've been having

17:04.023 --> 17:05.759
a lot of important shit to deal with, bro.

17:05.792 --> 17:07.227
I'm sorry, 'Riq.

17:07.260 --> 17:09.095
Look, I got a lot of shit going on,

17:09.129 --> 17:11.464
so I'ma need you
to handle the product alone.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.136
You trust me to do that?

17:16.169 --> 17:18.538
Yeah, of course.

17:21.341 --> 17:22.675
Be safe, a'ight?

17:22.709 --> 17:24.277
Yeah, you too.

17:28.248 --> 17:32.285
Window grills will run about...8,

17:32.318 --> 17:34.387
but you may not have to do 'em all.

17:34.421 --> 17:35.555
<i>You sure that's it?</i>

17:35.588 --> 17:37.724
'Cause we ain't trying to cut no corners.

17:37.757 --> 17:39.526
Do 'em all, plus extra, as best you got.

17:39.559 --> 17:40.693
Ma, we don't need to--

17:40.727 --> 17:42.262
How soon can you get it done?

17:42.295 --> 17:44.764
We're finishing up a big job in Astoria.

17:44.798 --> 17:46.766
I'm not sure if I can pull any men.

17:46.800 --> 17:48.835
Why don't you go look
at the windows in the back?

17:49.068 --> 17:50.637
<i>I think they need some new glass too.</i>

17:53.306 --> 17:54.707
Ma, the windows in the back are fine.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.609
It's an investment.

17:56.643 --> 17:58.845
The longer this bar is closed,
we can't wash our money.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.847
If we make it worth his while
to turn it around,

18:01.080 --> 18:02.215
we come out ahead.

18:02.248 --> 18:04.250
Now, how you looking with them numbers?

18:04.284 --> 18:05.518
Good.

18:05.552 --> 18:06.820
I taught myself the program,

18:06.853 --> 18:10.657
but I'd be even better
if I took accounting in school.

18:10.690 --> 18:12.258
Since when you interested in math?

18:12.292 --> 18:14.327
Oh, let me guess.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.763
They got just the right class
up there at Stansfield.

18:16.796 --> 18:18.097
Girl, you ain't slick

18:18.131 --> 18:19.632
trying to get up there close to Tariq.

18:19.666 --> 18:21.634
No, I just been thinking.

18:21.668 --> 18:24.437
If I can get an MBA,
that'll help the whole family.

18:24.471 --> 18:26.473
60% of NBA players go broke

18:26.506 --> 18:28.107
within five years of joining the league

18:28.141 --> 18:29.576
People always robbing 'em.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.811
But this way, I could do
Zeke's books when he goes pro.

18:31.845 --> 18:33.213
Protect the money.

18:33.246 --> 18:34.380
I get it,

18:34.414 --> 18:36.449
but you way outta your lane, little girl.

18:36.483 --> 18:38.518
Ain't no way for a girl
like you to mix school

18:38.551 --> 18:41.688
and the streets, at least not right now.

18:41.721 --> 18:43.423
<i>♪ Oh ♪</i>

18:43.456 --> 18:52.465
<i>♪ Can you stand the rain? ♪</i>

18:52.499 --> 18:56.135
<i>♪ Will you be there, girl? ♪</i>

18:59.539 --> 19:02.242
Wait. Ma, you like love songs now?

19:02.275 --> 19:03.810
What, that's 'cause your anniversary?

19:05.311 --> 19:08.448
Yeah. Yep, 22 years.

19:11.518 --> 19:13.753
Your father held me down
when nobody else did.

19:13.786 --> 19:15.455
He had my back.

19:15.488 --> 19:17.190
And I see you itching to get out there,

19:17.223 --> 19:21.761
but when it's your time,
having a lover makes you weak,

19:21.794 --> 19:23.630
but having a partner makes you strong.

19:23.663 --> 19:26.399
Remember that.

19:26.432 --> 19:29.302
Tariq ain't never gonna be that, D.

19:29.335 --> 19:30.670
He's his own man.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.889
All right, class, let's get started.

19:49.923 --> 19:53.259
Some of you may recognize
City Councilman Rashad Tate

19:53.293 --> 19:55.929
from his recent gubernatorial campaign.

19:55.962 --> 19:58.598
Now he's my new co-teacher
for this course.

19:58.631 --> 20:01.367
Uh, a politician's
gonna teach us about ethics?

20:01.401 --> 20:04.337
Okay, welcome to the new world, y'all.

20:04.370 --> 20:05.605
<i>The truth of the matter is</i>

20:05.638 --> 20:07.507
that my, uh, experience in government

20:07.540 --> 20:09.676
has given me a unique perspective

20:09.709 --> 20:12.378
on navigating tough ethical dilemmas

20:12.412 --> 20:13.713
out there in the real world,

20:13.746 --> 20:16.416
and I look forward to sharing
that with all of you.

20:16.449 --> 20:17.917
You can also follow me on Twitter--

20:17.951 --> 20:19.619
Okay, last time, we discussed

20:19.652 --> 20:22.221
how Thomas Hobbes denies the existence

20:22.255 --> 20:24.223
of pure selflessness in <i>Leviathan.</i>

20:24.257 --> 20:26.593
So now we throw it to you.

20:26.626 --> 20:28.428
Is there any truly selfless act?

20:28.461 --> 20:29.562
<i>Come on.</i>

20:29.596 --> 20:31.764
Everyone knows that even the good feeling

20:31.798 --> 20:35.435
that comes from a selfless deed
is self-serving motivation.

20:35.468 --> 20:37.337
Okay, but an act shouldn't
be written off as selfish

20:37.370 --> 20:39.739
just because there's a small
element of self-benefit.

20:39.772 --> 20:41.874
And plus, every good deed
doesn't feel good.

20:41.908 --> 20:44.444
Think about a mother
risking her life for her child.

20:44.477 --> 20:45.912
<i>Kin selection.</i>

20:45.945 --> 20:48.314
Darwin said any organism's goal
is survival of its species.

20:48.348 --> 20:51.584
Selflessness is just
a casualty of evolution.

20:51.618 --> 20:53.586
That's cynical. Then how do you explain

20:53.620 --> 20:56.823
Jesus' ultimate selfless act
of dying for our sins?

20:56.856 --> 20:58.758
All right, but Jesus is famous as fuck.

20:58.791 --> 21:01.260
Nah, every good deed has a selfish motive,

21:01.294 --> 21:02.962
even if it's just the promise
of getting into heaven.

21:02.996 --> 21:05.598
Interesting. So what I'm understanding--

21:05.632 --> 21:09.936
If I may, Professor Milgram,
your question is flawed.

21:09.969 --> 21:13.373
So-called selflessness
is an arbitrary moral standard,

21:13.406 --> 21:15.842
when the reality is that it is possible

21:15.875 --> 21:20.513
for all parties to gain
from any given interaction.

21:20.546 --> 21:22.281
<i>That's what I'm talking 'bout.</i>

21:22.315 --> 21:24.017
If you scratch my back, I scratch yours.

21:24.050 --> 21:26.452
Anything else is just a waste of time.

21:26.486 --> 21:28.688
I like the way you think, Ms. Carmichael.

21:28.721 --> 21:30.356
I like the way I think too.

21:32.992 --> 21:37.563
One, two, three, bring it up.

21:37.597 --> 21:39.065
Just like that. Get up.

21:40.533 --> 21:43.536
Yep. It's all right.

21:43.569 --> 21:44.737
You go it.

21:44.771 --> 21:46.973
You really think this is gonna help?

21:47.006 --> 21:49.842
It got my jumper back
when I messed up my shoulder.

21:51.010 --> 21:53.346
Your announcement went well this morning.

21:53.379 --> 21:54.414
You good?

21:54.447 --> 21:55.682
<i>For sure, yeah.</i>

21:55.715 --> 21:57.617
I'm excited about going to the league.

21:57.650 --> 22:00.019
Just, you know, there's some things

22:00.053 --> 22:02.822
I'ma miss about Stansfield.

22:02.855 --> 22:04.424
Some people.

22:06.726 --> 22:08.561
Yeah, I feel you.

22:09.796 --> 22:11.731
Some people I'ma miss
when we leave the city too.

22:11.764 --> 22:13.866
But we'll all be safer with you away

22:13.900 --> 22:16.002
from Tariq and CourseCorrect, so...

22:16.035 --> 22:17.770
That's 'Riq on CourseCorrect?

22:17.804 --> 22:20.606
He slick as a motherfucker.
That shit's on lock.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.675
And what you talking about,
when you leave the city?

22:22.709 --> 22:23.810
Auntie Monet ain't gonna
let y'all go anywhere.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.344
<i>That's not what she's saying.</i>

22:25.378 --> 22:27.080
She had us all thinking
this whole NBA shit

22:27.113 --> 22:28.347
was just her retirement plan,

22:28.381 --> 22:29.882
but now it's her exit strategy

22:29.916 --> 22:31.451
from the whole thing.

22:31.484 --> 22:33.619
Wherever you get drafted,
she's gonna have us all follow.

22:35.421 --> 22:39.492
Yo, Freaky Zekey!

22:39.525 --> 22:41.828
Been following your career. Big fan.

22:41.861 --> 22:43.930
I, uh, couldn't get to you
at the press conference,

22:43.963 --> 22:47.800
but I would love to help you

22:47.834 --> 22:51.037
navigate your options.

22:51.070 --> 22:52.572
Give me a call.

22:55.141 --> 22:56.876
Thank you.

22:58.111 --> 22:59.979
Call me.

23:11.124 --> 23:13.826
Tariq. What a surprise.

23:13.860 --> 23:15.428
You really believe what you said?

23:15.461 --> 23:17.463
You know, about both parties
being able to gain

23:17.497 --> 23:18.664
from an interaction?

23:18.698 --> 23:20.433
'Cause I could definitely use some help

23:20.466 --> 23:22.769
from someone of your stature
with the family court system.

23:22.802 --> 23:25.104
That's a high mountain to climb.

23:25.138 --> 23:27.874
Yes. Yes, it is. So what do you need?

23:27.907 --> 23:29.175
You know, what could I do for you?

23:29.408 --> 23:32.411
Tariq, there's nothing you can do for me--

23:32.445 --> 23:34.981
actually, you wouldn't happen to know

23:35.014 --> 23:37.750
any Westons that go here, do you?

23:37.784 --> 23:38.951
Hmm...

23:41.487 --> 23:42.722
In fact, I do.

23:44.857 --> 23:46.793
Well, turns out that I'm feeling

23:46.826 --> 23:49.095
mighty altruistic today, young brother.

23:49.128 --> 23:51.631
So if you need my help,
here's what I need from you--

23:51.664 --> 23:52.932
Tariq St. Patrick?

23:52.965 --> 23:56.002
Detective Kevin Whitman, NYPD.
Come with me.

23:56.035 --> 23:58.771
Detective?
Hey, man, you should, uh--

23:58.805 --> 24:01.174
you should go see about that.

24:01.207 --> 24:04.043
Keep your head up, young brother.

24:07.513 --> 24:10.116
Go ahead and have a seat.

24:10.149 --> 24:11.184
Sorry about all this.

24:11.217 --> 24:13.152
It's, uh, the only office available.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.190
<i>Tariq, do you know anything at all</i>

24:17.223 --> 24:18.991
about the murder of Jabari Reynolds?

24:19.025 --> 24:20.993
No, sir. Someone say I did?

24:21.027 --> 24:22.662
No.

24:22.695 --> 24:25.598
I'm just speaking
with all of his students.

24:25.631 --> 24:27.233
See if it yields anything.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.202
<i>Detective Santana said
you were in here with him</i>

24:29.235 --> 24:30.469
the day before his death.

24:30.503 --> 24:32.738
Did you notice any odd behavior

24:32.772 --> 24:34.207
by or around him then?

24:34.240 --> 24:36.876
In all honesty, Detective,
I really just been,

24:36.909 --> 24:38.845
you know, focused
on juggling my schoolwork,

24:38.878 --> 24:40.713
my mother's case, so...

24:40.746 --> 24:42.882
haven't really been
focused on anything else.

24:42.915 --> 24:45.184
You aware of any personal relationships

24:45.218 --> 24:46.619
that Mr. Reynolds may have had?

24:46.652 --> 24:48.955
<i>Anything suspicious?</i>

24:48.988 --> 24:50.790
No.

24:50.823 --> 24:53.492
How about faculty?

24:53.526 --> 24:55.261
You ever notice any tension
between Mr. Reynolds

24:55.494 --> 24:56.729
and the other professors?

24:56.762 --> 24:59.999
Let's say, oh, Carrie Milgram?

25:03.703 --> 25:04.871
Actually, yes.

25:04.904 --> 25:06.572
Um, there was some rumors

25:06.606 --> 25:08.841
about them, you know, being together.

25:08.875 --> 25:11.777
There was this dinner
at the Baldwin's house.

25:11.811 --> 25:13.579
I got there a little late,
and I'm not sure

25:13.613 --> 25:14.947
if Lauren told you anything about this,

25:14.981 --> 25:18.117
but, you know, those two,
they had a pretty,

25:18.150 --> 25:20.019
pretty heated argument.

25:23.256 --> 25:26.559
Thank you. That's very helpful.

Okay, look, Effie, I'm sorry, okay?

26:39.799 --> 26:41.033
Tariq was dealing with some family stuff--

26:41.067 --> 26:42.234
Miss me with the excuses.

26:42.268 --> 26:43.836
Tariq is only worried about himself,

26:43.869 --> 26:45.938
and you need to realize that
if we're gonna work together.

26:45.972 --> 26:47.273
- Now go.
- Effie, it's not like--

26:53.012 --> 26:54.380
<i>Skids, I need you to bring me</i>

26:54.613 --> 26:55.881
<i>some supplies by the house.</i>

27:33.986 --> 27:35.855

27:35.888 --> 27:38.124
Listen, though, they found they suspect,

27:38.157 --> 27:39.859
and I know who it is.

27:39.892 --> 27:41.260
Who is it?

27:41.293 --> 27:43.662
It's the nigga's ex.

<i>Oh, c'mon.</i>

28:57.002 --> 28:58.871
Everyone has the right

It's in the constitution. I am a patriot.

29:02.141 --> 29:04.310
You sold your soul to the devil, Saxe.

29:04.343 --> 29:07.113

Oh, you'll love this.

29:09.515 --> 29:11.117
<i>Um, I caught the Jabari Reynold's case</i>

29:11.150 --> 29:12.751
at work, and you'll never believe

29:12.785 --> 29:14.887
who the investigation's prime suspect is.

29:14.920 --> 29:16.155
Carrie Milgram.

29:16.188 --> 29:18.057
- No way.
- Mm-hmm.

29:18.090 --> 29:19.525
<i>After she left the prosecutor's office,</i>

29:19.758 --> 29:21.160
<i>she landed a teaching gig at Stansfield,</i>

29:21.193 --> 29:23.829
where she helped bring on
none other than...

29:23.863 --> 29:27.133
Reynolds. Wow. Spicy.

29:27.166 --> 29:29.301
But she's not a murderer.

29:29.335 --> 29:31.103
That's not what I'm hearing.

29:31.137 --> 29:33.105
- Who's on it?
<i>Kevin Whitman.</i>

29:33.139 --> 29:35.007
And there was another familiar name

29:35.040 --> 29:38.010
on his list of Reynolds advisees.

29:38.043 --> 29:39.778
Tariq St. Patrick.

29:39.812 --> 29:44.083
So if your client has any info
he'd like to share,

29:44.116 --> 29:46.252
my door is always open.

29:46.285 --> 29:50.189
Oh, motherfucker.

29:50.222 --> 29:52.091
Fucking Tariq.

30:08.841 --> 30:10.009
What's up?

30:10.042 --> 30:11.977
What up, D?

30:12.011 --> 30:13.179
What are you doing here?

30:14.880 --> 30:17.349
Um, I need a ride, to New Haven.

30:18.584 --> 30:20.052
New Haven?

30:20.085 --> 30:22.588
'Riq, that's two hours away,
maybe three with traffic.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.256
Monet will kill me if I'm gone that long.

30:24.290 --> 30:27.893
Yeah, I know, but,
I mean, it's about the business

30:27.927 --> 30:30.129
and the drugs that you packaged for me.

30:30.162 --> 30:32.198
It's just a ride. C'mon, please?

30:38.270 --> 30:39.872
<i>No, because you got me fucked up.</i>

30:39.905 --> 30:41.307
You know what, why don't we
just wait for 'Riq?

30:41.340 --> 30:43.242
- Bitch, we got--
- What the fuck is going on?

30:43.275 --> 30:44.510
Your girl sold us some fake-ass coke

30:44.543 --> 30:46.245
and said it was on you.

30:46.278 --> 30:48.881
- Not me, per se.
- The fuck do you mean not you?

30:48.914 --> 30:50.549
- You dropped that shit off.
- I don't care who it's on.

30:50.583 --> 30:52.318
Someone better make it right
before my 15 ends,

30:52.351 --> 30:53.619
- or I'm gonna fuck you--
- Or you gonna what?

30:53.852 --> 30:55.321
What the fuck you gonna do?
You not gonna do shit.

30:55.354 --> 30:56.622
- Effie--
- Brayden, shut up.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.023
Yeah, shut up, Brayden.

30:58.057 --> 30:59.525
I'm trying to make a business transaction,

30:59.558 --> 31:01.260
- and this bitch is selling me--
- Yo, who you calling a bitch?

31:01.293 --> 31:03.395
-...fucking stupid!
- Hey, chill the fuck out!

31:03.429 --> 31:04.863
Chill the fuck out!

31:30.656 --> 31:32.091
<i>I swear to God,</i>

31:32.124 --> 31:36.061
that better be Tariq
motherfucking St. Patrick.

31:38.897 --> 31:40.399
Finally, bro. Where the fuck you been?

31:40.432 --> 31:41.634
Yo, what happened to him?

31:41.667 --> 31:42.935
Who's she?

31:42.968 --> 31:44.670
Oh, Effie, this is Diana.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.038
She works with us as well.

31:46.071 --> 31:48.073
She drove me up here. Di, this is Effie.

31:48.107 --> 31:49.108
Sup?

31:49.141 --> 31:50.276
You his girl?

31:50.309 --> 31:53.178
- Why are you asking?
- It's not like that.

31:53.212 --> 31:54.480
Whatever. I don't care.

31:54.513 --> 31:56.081
What I care about is

31:56.115 --> 31:57.549
this powdered fucking sugar
could have gotten me killed.

31:57.583 --> 31:58.951
Where the fuck is the real shit?

31:58.984 --> 32:00.185
Fuck are you talking about,
powdered sugar?

32:00.219 --> 32:02.121
<i>What is this?</i>

32:02.154 --> 32:04.390
Hey, I didn't touch shit.
We must have got it like that.

32:04.423 --> 32:06.492
Excuse me? Yo, we don't sell tainted shit.

32:06.525 --> 32:09.295
Sounds like it wasn't a problem
till it got to Effie.

32:10.663 --> 32:12.131
I already beat one bitch ass tonight.

32:12.164 --> 32:13.532
- Who you calling a bitch?
- But I will beat your--

32:13.565 --> 32:14.600
- Yo, chill out.

32:14.633 --> 32:16.201
Chill out. Chill the fuck out.

32:16.235 --> 32:17.503
Doesn't fucking matter whose fault it is.

32:17.536 --> 32:19.171
Either way, we're fucked
if we don't get some product,

32:19.204 --> 32:20.973
so we gotta figure some shit out.

32:21.006 --> 32:23.375
He's right about that. What's the plan?

32:23.409 --> 32:25.144
And who's gonna tell Monet?

32:25.177 --> 32:27.279
Who's Monet?

32:31.116 --> 32:33.285
Fuck.

32:40.959 --> 32:43.329
[Dru, whispering] Yo, ma's been
looking for you.

32:45.731 --> 32:47.666
The fuck you been?

32:49.368 --> 32:50.736
I was hanging out with Tariq.

32:50.969 --> 32:52.404
He got caught with fake product.

32:52.438 --> 32:54.373
- Ours.
<i>What?</i>

33:06.752 --> 33:09.321
That motherfucker.

33:09.355 --> 33:11.123
I know Rico did this shit.

33:11.156 --> 33:13.592
I'm glad I shot his ass.

33:13.625 --> 33:15.327
Well, kids, that's the game.

33:15.361 --> 33:17.496
Guess we having cake for dessert.

33:19.732 --> 33:22.067
For real?

33:22.101 --> 33:23.736
That just happen?

33:51.597 --> 33:54.066
You shouldn't be here.

33:54.099 --> 33:55.667
I know.

33:55.701 --> 33:58.036
♪ I came to apologize ♪

34:03.442 --> 34:06.178
What you said at the hospital,

34:06.211 --> 34:09.214
that I only think about myself,

34:09.248 --> 34:11.083
I felt that.

34:11.116 --> 34:13.285
I wanna make it right. I wanna help you.

34:14.620 --> 34:16.255
How?

34:16.288 --> 34:18.223
Get in the car.

34:28.133 --> 34:31.270
- Shit!

34:31.303 --> 34:33.806
Why would you bring me here
with a bum hand, man?

34:33.839 --> 34:35.441
Because the family needs protection now,

34:35.474 --> 34:36.442
and this is how I can help.

34:39.578 --> 34:40.646
Come on.

34:40.679 --> 34:42.381
Yo, y-you know I can't shoot lefty.

34:42.414 --> 34:43.649
This ain't drawing, Dru.

34:43.682 --> 34:45.784
It don't take fine fucking motor skills.

34:50.856 --> 34:52.291
Now focus.

34:56.595 --> 34:58.864
- Man--
- It's all good. It's all good.

34:59.097 --> 35:01.133
- Try again.

35:17.316 --> 35:19.785
- How's D?
<i>She good.</i>

35:19.818 --> 35:22.421
Mom's bugging out though.

35:22.454 --> 35:23.889
Rico ripped us off on our last
supply.

35:24.122 --> 35:26.558
You know what she did? Laughed.

35:26.592 --> 35:28.794
- Shit. What you gon' do?

35:28.827 --> 35:33.599
I don't know, but we need a new connect.

35:33.632 --> 35:36.568
Quick.

35:36.602 --> 35:38.370
I might be able to help out with that.

35:48.447 --> 35:50.182
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:51.917 --> 35:53.252
You look nice.

35:53.285 --> 35:56.188
Thank you.

36:00.459 --> 36:04.396
Hey, um, congratulations on the draft.

36:04.429 --> 36:06.231
That's really exciting.

36:06.265 --> 36:08.700
Thank you. Yeah, yeah. It's wild.

36:08.734 --> 36:12.504
Yeah, I...I think we should
talk about some things.

36:12.538 --> 36:15.207
Yeah, I know you thought
I-I should finish school first.

36:15.240 --> 36:16.742
No, Zeke. I get it.

36:16.775 --> 36:19.344
It's just, you know, I--I have to look out

36:19.378 --> 36:20.879
for my family, you know?

36:20.913 --> 36:22.814
People are watching everything I do now.

36:22.848 --> 36:25.717
So there's all this pressure,

36:25.751 --> 36:29.755
and I just...

36:29.788 --> 36:32.691
I don't wanna give you up, but, like, uh,

36:32.724 --> 36:37.195
I think it's best if we stopped
seeing each other.

36:39.431 --> 36:41.199
I understand.

36:48.974 --> 36:50.909
Good luck, Zeke.

36:52.344 --> 36:54.379
Bye, Carrie.

37:41.927 --> 37:44.696
What was Zeke Cross doing here?

37:44.730 --> 37:47.432
Excuse me, you can't
just barge in here, Kevin.

37:47.466 --> 37:50.369
And why are you talking to my sponsor?

37:52.471 --> 37:54.306
You moved the couch.

37:54.339 --> 37:56.308
Is that what this is about?

37:56.341 --> 37:57.976
What happened between us?

37:58.010 --> 37:59.978
No, this is about the fact

38:00.012 --> 38:01.546
that I already gave you an opportunity

38:01.580 --> 38:03.048
to tell me the truth once, and you didn't.

38:03.281 --> 38:04.616
I'm gonna give you one more chance.

38:04.650 --> 38:06.852
What was he doing here, and don't lie.

38:06.885 --> 38:08.654
I'm not talking to you without my lawyer.

38:08.687 --> 38:12.024
Fine, don't talk. Shut up and listen.

38:12.057 --> 38:14.760
You see, I know that up until recently,

38:14.793 --> 38:17.396
you had some sort of
tumultuous sexual relationship

38:17.429 --> 38:18.597
with Jabari Reynolds,

38:18.630 --> 38:20.365
and you lied to me about the timeline.

38:20.399 --> 38:21.900
Now, why would you do that, Carrie?

38:21.933 --> 38:24.436
You worried that your ongoing
relationship with the victim

38:24.469 --> 38:25.737
makes you the prime suspect in his murder?

38:25.771 --> 38:27.572
God, I didn't tell you

38:27.606 --> 38:30.308
because I knew you'd draw
the wrong conclusion.

38:30.342 --> 38:32.611
Where were you on the night
of Jabari Reynolds' murder?

38:32.644 --> 38:35.013
I didn't kill Jabari.

38:35.047 --> 38:36.014
Where were you?

38:36.048 --> 38:37.416
I was here at home.

38:37.449 --> 38:38.784
Alone? Really?

38:38.817 --> 38:41.053
'Cause you and I both know
that's not an alibi.

38:43.588 --> 38:45.624
Zeke was here, okay?

38:49.027 --> 38:50.629
Cross.

38:50.662 --> 38:52.798
You were home between the hours
of 7:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m.

38:52.831 --> 38:55.734
with your student, Ezekiel Cross.

38:55.767 --> 38:57.569
Yes.

38:58.770 --> 39:02.074
Wow. I'll talk to him.

39:02.107 --> 39:03.809
If you tell him to corroborate your story,

39:03.842 --> 39:07.512
I will get you disbarred
and I will lock you both up.

39:07.546 --> 39:09.081
<i>You know, in the meantime,</i>

39:09.114 --> 39:11.083
you really should have
your lawyer call me.

39:23.695 --> 39:25.597
<i>So, Ma, it's a new connect.</i>

39:25.630 --> 39:27.766
Cane knows him. He's gonna be our liaison.

39:27.799 --> 39:29.801
I ain't fucking with nobody
that's down with Cane.

39:29.835 --> 39:31.703
And it's real interesting
how you come in here

39:31.737 --> 39:33.805
with his name out your mouth
after what he did.

39:34.840 --> 39:36.842
You and I both know
that Cane isn't the only reason

39:36.875 --> 39:38.677
I ended up in the hospital.

39:38.710 --> 39:40.879
Now, I've forgiven him for his part in it.

39:42.013 --> 39:44.883
So can you?

39:44.916 --> 39:46.985
I'm sorry, I can't.

39:56.895 --> 40:00.599

40:26.725 --> 40:28.994
Not at all. What can I do for you?

40:31.029 --> 40:33.165
Well, you know, you told me
I could come to you

40:33.198 --> 40:34.800
whenever I needed help

40:34.833 --> 40:36.868
or whenever I just wanted to talk,

40:36.902 --> 40:38.570
and my little sister,

40:38.603 --> 40:41.606
she was just put into the child
service system this week.

40:41.640 --> 40:44.442
Oh, Tariq. I'm so sorry.

40:44.476 --> 40:47.445
I mean, of course,
I'll help however I can.

40:47.479 --> 40:49.114

- Professor Milgram.

40:49.147 --> 40:51.049
- You got a minute?
- I'm with a student.

40:51.082 --> 40:53.051
Yeah, but I need to speak with you.

40:55.153 --> 40:57.889
I'm sorry, Tariq. Just two minutes.

41:09.467 --> 41:11.503
We need to talk about this police presence

41:11.536 --> 41:12.704
here on campus.

41:12.737 --> 41:13.839
This couldn't wait?

41:13.872 --> 41:16.174
No. They're using my office again.

41:16.208 --> 41:17.776
It's not a good look.

41:32.757 --> 41:34.159
I need to get back to work, Rashad.

41:34.192 --> 41:37.929
You know, the detective
talked to Tariq yesterday.

41:37.963 --> 41:39.231
<i>You know what that was about?</i>

41:39.264 --> 41:42.534
<i>This has nothing to do
with Tariq.</i>

41:42.567 --> 41:45.136
He's been through a lot. He's a good kid.

41:46.271 --> 41:47.839
Don't interrupt me again.

41:49.107 --> 41:50.609
Duly noted.

41:51.843 --> 41:53.612
Oh. Tariq, you okay?

41:53.645 --> 41:54.679
Yes. I gotta go.

42:04.823 --> 42:07.659
Can you believe it? Another year.

42:08.927 --> 42:10.795
Yep, another year.

42:11.997 --> 42:14.032
C'mon, baby. It's our anniversary.

42:14.065 --> 42:17.936
Yeah, I know, and it's the same
old played out routine.

42:17.969 --> 42:20.238
I'm even wearing the same
busted-ass lingerie.

42:20.272 --> 42:21.907
'Cause it's my favorite.

42:21.940 --> 42:23.742
Back on our wedding day,

42:23.775 --> 42:26.077
I didn't think it was gonna
be like this, 'Renzo.

42:26.111 --> 42:27.178
I need more.

42:30.081 --> 42:33.919
It is what it is, Mo. You know that.

42:33.952 --> 42:36.154
It's hard for me too.

42:36.187 --> 42:37.822
I wish I could be by your side every day.

42:37.856 --> 42:39.024
But you can't.

42:39.057 --> 42:41.293
I bought you all this shit,
and what do I get?

42:41.326 --> 42:42.827
Air.

42:42.861 --> 42:44.329
That's what I get every fucking day.

42:44.562 --> 42:45.830
Air.

42:45.864 --> 42:47.766
When Rico's out there giving me fake shit,

42:47.799 --> 42:49.334
you know what I got to help me?

42:49.567 --> 42:51.069
Air.

42:53.171 --> 42:54.339
Where's Cane's signature?

42:54.572 --> 42:55.907
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

42:55.941 --> 42:57.809
Cane is out. He killed Ramirez.

42:57.842 --> 42:59.744
Ramirez? Is that what this is about?

42:59.778 --> 43:01.913
This is not about no fucking Ramirez.

43:01.947 --> 43:04.082
This is about your son
going against the family.

43:04.115 --> 43:06.184
And now he's back all of a sudden

43:06.217 --> 43:08.987
with some new fucking connect
out of nowhere.

43:09.020 --> 43:10.188
Cane's got a new connect?

43:10.221 --> 43:13.291
Fuck his connect.

43:13.325 --> 43:14.759
How you gonna say you want more,

43:14.793 --> 43:17.262
you can't even keep
this family together?

43:17.295 --> 43:19.731
You killed Rico.

43:19.764 --> 43:24.002
If Cane's offering product,
you need to take it, today.

43:35.747 --> 43:37.315
Yo, why the fuck y'all think you can

43:37.349 --> 43:39.117
just keep rolling up on my shit like this?

43:39.150 --> 43:40.785
- Take a walk.
- You bugging.

43:40.819 --> 43:42.387
It's, like, 20 degrees outside.

43:44.356 --> 43:46.992
Bye, y'all.

43:48.660 --> 43:50.295
So Dru told me about your offer.

43:51.329 --> 43:54.299
Yeah. You interested?

43:54.332 --> 43:56.301
It depends.

43:56.334 --> 43:57.936
Before we can discuss any of that,

43:57.969 --> 43:59.704
I need to know I could trust you, Cane.

44:03.908 --> 44:06.111
For starters, enough of this lyin' shit,

44:06.144 --> 44:07.412
or your father ain't gonna be able

44:07.645 --> 44:08.747
to protect your ass next time.

44:11.116 --> 44:13.084
Don't you ever forget who your family is.

44:13.118 --> 44:15.820
You hear me? And Tariq is off limits.

44:15.854 --> 44:18.656
You both in two different lanes,
and it needs to stay that way.

44:20.825 --> 44:23.094
Now, are we good?

44:23.128 --> 44:25.296
Yeah, we good.

44:27.165 --> 44:30.135
A'ight. Get your things
and come on home.

44:51.056 --> 44:52.690
What do you want?

44:52.724 --> 44:54.826
Look, if this is about your boy
Tariq, you can have him, okay?

44:54.859 --> 44:56.895
I ain't with that sometime-y shit.
I already told him.

44:56.928 --> 44:59.264
There's nothing going on
between me and Tariq.

44:59.297 --> 45:02.200
This ain't about that at all.
This is about business.

45:10.909 --> 45:12.310
I saw what you're doing.

45:12.343 --> 45:14.212
Going to school and moving weight.

45:14.245 --> 45:17.782
And I wanna do the same.
Can you teach me how?

45:17.816 --> 45:20.185
Your mom got you on lock.

45:20.218 --> 45:21.753
I don't think she gon' be cool with that.

45:21.786 --> 45:22.887
Well, she can't have an opinion

45:22.921 --> 45:24.289
on something she don't know about.

45:26.724 --> 45:29.928
It's not easy. I mean, are you even smart?

45:29.961 --> 45:32.964
I'm smart enough.

45:32.997 --> 45:34.799
Okay.

45:34.833 --> 45:35.834
Well, if you're so smart,

45:35.867 --> 45:37.869
then what happened to your product?

45:37.902 --> 45:40.405
Who stepped on it?

45:40.438 --> 45:42.474
My moms thinks it's our old connect,

45:42.507 --> 45:43.975
but, um, I don't know.

45:44.008 --> 45:46.044
- That don't make sense.
- Right.

45:46.077 --> 45:48.113
Well, if you wanna figure it out,
you should think about it.

45:48.146 --> 45:50.515
You know all the players, right?

45:50.748 --> 45:52.817
<i>Cui bono?</i>

45:52.851 --> 45:54.085
I don't speak Italian.

45:54.119 --> 45:55.854
It's not Italian. It's Latin.

45:55.887 --> 45:57.755
It means,

45:57.789 --> 46:00.291
who had the most to gain
from fucking up your shit?

46:06.464 --> 46:08.299
<i>You think I need this shit?</i>

46:08.333 --> 46:10.101
The last thing I need is more product.

46:11.402 --> 46:13.304
This is bigger than bricks, man.

46:13.338 --> 46:15.940
The people I jacked this from,
they need a new connect

46:15.974 --> 46:17.976
right now, and they big.

46:18.009 --> 46:20.245
A real organization like you wanted.

46:20.278 --> 46:22.280
- You merk anyone to get it?
Nah.

46:22.313 --> 46:25.116
I swiped that from some low-level cat.

46:26.084 --> 46:28.820
He had it parked in some garage.

46:28.853 --> 46:31.322
Found the nigga's address
on IG, like you said.

46:31.356 --> 46:33.324
<i>Replaced his bricks with sugar.</i>

46:34.859 --> 46:36.361
He never even knew.

46:36.394 --> 46:39.030
Good plan. Smart.

46:41.366 --> 46:44.802
Now, I can get you a taste,

46:44.836 --> 46:46.337
if you ready to let me in.

46:50.108 --> 46:52.877
And who exactly would we be
going into business with?

46:54.345 --> 46:55.513
Monet Tejada.

46:57.815 --> 46:59.317
You stole from your own family.

46:59.350 --> 47:01.119
Fuck no.

47:01.152 --> 47:03.354
I created a opportunity for them

47:03.388 --> 47:04.989
that they didn't even know they needed.

47:06.591 --> 47:08.860
I helped them.

47:29.914 --> 47:31.416
You mind?

47:31.449 --> 47:32.951
Yeah. Yeah.

47:34.118 --> 47:35.887
- You okay, Davis?
<i>Yeah.</i>

47:35.920 --> 47:38.223
Couldn't be better. What's up?

47:39.490 --> 47:43.361
I think your favorite collegiate client

47:43.394 --> 47:45.196
might be mixed up in another murder.

47:45.230 --> 47:47.465
Cha-ching. How do you know?

47:48.967 --> 47:50.902
Um, you may not like this,

47:50.935 --> 47:54.472
but I've been, uh, seeing Jenny Sullivan.

47:54.505 --> 47:57.408
Oh, my God. You're fucking the ops.

47:57.442 --> 47:59.143
- It's not like that.
- It's like what?

47:59.177 --> 48:01.012
I mean, yeah, I'm fucking her.

48:01.045 --> 48:02.347
I'm fucking her, but anyway,

48:02.380 --> 48:04.249
she's on that Stansfield murder,

48:04.282 --> 48:06.017
Jabari Reynolds,

48:06.050 --> 48:09.187
and apparently,
Tariq was one of his students.

48:09.220 --> 48:11.356
Now, he's not a suspect yet,

48:11.389 --> 48:13.124
<i>but the lead they're following</i>

48:13.157 --> 48:15.126
sounds like total bullshit to me.

48:15.159 --> 48:18.663
You know, uh, Caridad Milgram?
Used to be in the DA's office?

48:23.968 --> 48:26.304
Carrie Milgram's their lead suspect?

48:26.337 --> 48:28.006
Mm-hmm.

48:28.039 --> 48:29.574
Keep me posted.

48:29.607 --> 48:31.009
Anything you can get on Milgram

48:31.042 --> 48:33.378
and whether or not
it's gonna back up on Tariq.

48:33.411 --> 48:36.080
Whoo, I-I thought that you were
gonna have a problem

48:36.114 --> 48:38.616
with my, uh, entanglement.

48:38.650 --> 48:40.418
A problem?

48:40.451 --> 48:45.323
I mean, uh, you get inside, I get info.

48:45.356 --> 48:47.058
Sounds like we both win.

48:47.091 --> 48:48.126
Hmm?

48:53.164 --> 48:56.534
Hey, I was about to head out,
and--oh, you too.

48:56.567 --> 49:00.605
Um, you wanna--
I don't know, you wanna--no.

49:00.638 --> 49:02.106
Okay, I get it. I understand the vibes.

49:02.140 --> 49:03.241
Not a problem.

49:03.274 --> 49:06.344
Um, maybe some other time. Good night.

I hope you wore your diapers,

49:30.568 --> 49:34.372

This is so fucked up.

49:40.178 --> 49:42.113
Hey, Skids, eyes forward.

50:27.392 --> 50:30.161
- Hey, Tariq.
- Yo.

50:30.194 --> 50:32.397
You never come to these types of things.

50:32.430 --> 50:34.766
I mean, can you blame me?

50:34.799 --> 50:37.568
Shit like that is the reason why.

50:37.602 --> 50:39.437
You wanna get out of here?

50:39.470 --> 50:42.039
Where we gonna go?

50:42.073 --> 50:43.307
I know a spot.

50:43.341 --> 50:44.475
Right behind you.

50:54.652 --> 50:57.121
Dru, you barely eating.

50:57.155 --> 50:59.590
Diana, give him some more beans.

51:03.694 --> 51:05.196
What's he doing here?

51:05.229 --> 51:07.432
Cane finally decided
to do something for the family.

51:09.400 --> 51:10.802
He got us a new connect.

51:10.835 --> 51:12.437
Sup, y'all?

51:12.470 --> 51:14.272
Go ahead. Get yourself a plate.

51:14.305 --> 51:16.674
Yes, ma'am.

51:22.113 --> 51:23.748
<i>Whoa, y'all hear that?</i>

51:23.781 --> 51:25.683
I'll be back.

51:29.587 --> 51:31.222
Yo, did you call Cane this morning

51:31.255 --> 51:32.490
before he pitched you the connect,

51:32.523 --> 51:34.292
or did he reach out to you?

51:34.325 --> 51:35.560
Nah, he rolled up on me.

51:59.317 --> 52:02.186
Damn, this is fire.

52:02.220 --> 52:05.456
Yep, this is
my favorite spot on campus.

52:05.490 --> 52:07.124
How'd you find this?

52:07.158 --> 52:08.759
It's a secret.

52:08.793 --> 52:11.162
Nah, my brother picked the lock
when he was a student here.

52:11.195 --> 52:13.798
Literally nobody knows about this spot.

52:13.831 --> 52:16.868
See? There's a selfless act.

52:16.901 --> 52:19.270
You know, with everything
you've been through,

52:19.303 --> 52:21.672
no one would blame you for being cynical.

52:21.706 --> 52:23.808
But you still think
people can be selfless.

52:25.142 --> 52:26.477
I look at shit like this.

52:26.511 --> 52:28.446
Sometimes life puts you in situations

52:28.479 --> 52:30.581
with no possible good outcomes.

52:30.615 --> 52:32.350
So you take the hit yourself
because you know

52:32.383 --> 52:35.853
you can handle it way better
than the other person can.

52:35.887 --> 52:37.889
Oh, well,

52:37.922 --> 52:41.259
I guess I just haven't
loved somebody that much yet.

53:07.818 --> 53:09.921
Just so you know, Monet was mad as fuck

53:09.954 --> 53:12.490
about the bricks yesterday,
but I smoothed it over.

53:12.523 --> 53:14.759
<i>Look, 'Riq, we got more product
coming soon,</i>

53:14.792 --> 53:16.894
and you gonna need a place to stash it.

53:16.928 --> 53:18.663
Somewhere safe.

53:18.696 --> 53:20.598
A'ight, bet. I owe you.

53:26.237 --> 53:28.406
- I wanna apologize. I--
Tariq, you know what?

53:28.439 --> 53:30.608
It's like every time
things get good with us,

53:30.641 --> 53:31.976
you get real distracted.

53:32.209 --> 53:33.544
- No, that's not the case at--
- No, it's cool.

53:33.578 --> 53:36.314
I'm gonna go.

53:36.347 --> 53:39.216

54:00.972 --> 54:02.306
Oh, get out of here.

54:02.340 --> 54:03.674
Okay, Carrie, look, look.

54:03.708 --> 54:05.843
Look, I- I know what you think
about me, all right?

54:05.876 --> 54:08.846
I--I just wanna make things up to you.

54:08.879 --> 54:10.681
I hear you're in trouble.

54:10.715 --> 54:12.683
- A murder?

54:12.717 --> 54:15.252
I see you're not wearing your ring.

54:15.286 --> 54:19.256
That's not why I'm here.
I just wanna help you, Carrie.

54:19.290 --> 54:21.626
I don't want your help.

54:21.659 --> 54:23.961
But you need it.

54:23.995 --> 54:25.396
Don't--Carrie, please.

54:37.008 --> 54:38.476
Yeah, baby.

54:38.509 --> 54:41.412
Are you gonna buck like that
for the Bulls next year?

54:41.445 --> 54:43.681
Or are you taking this to the Lakers?

54:43.714 --> 54:45.583
- The Knicks could use a savior.

54:45.616 --> 54:46.851
Shh, shh, shh.

54:46.884 --> 54:48.285
Shh.

54:51.956 --> 54:53.758
Knicks are past saving.

54:55.693 --> 54:58.429
But for real, where you wanna play?

55:01.032 --> 55:02.299
Hey, go away. I'm busy.

55:10.875 --> 55:12.910
- Ezekiel Cross.
- Excuse me. Rude.

55:12.943 --> 55:14.645
You can shut the fuck up.
Put your pants on.

55:14.679 --> 55:16.313
I'm taking you downtown
for some questions.

55:16.347 --> 55:17.515
- What? Why?
- Don't worry about why.

55:17.548 --> 55:18.816
Just get your shit.

55:18.849 --> 55:20.618
Okay, you better not touch him.
I'm recording you.

55:20.651 --> 55:21.719
Great. Come on. Let's go.

55:21.752 --> 55:22.920
All right, let me just put my shoes on.

55:22.953 --> 55:24.388
C'mon.
Take your shoes and everything.

55:24.422 --> 55:25.489
Why?
You better not lay

55:25.523 --> 55:26.691
<i>a hand on him.</i>

56:10.067 --> 56:11.635
You remembered our signal.

56:11.669 --> 56:13.037
Of course I did.

56:13.070 --> 56:15.039

56:32.123 --> 56:35.392

56:35.426 --> 56:37.661

56:38.763 --> 56:42.032
