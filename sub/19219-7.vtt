WEBVTT

00:01.002 --> 00:02.337
Previously on "The 100"...

00:02.545 --> 00:04.005
We didn't
treat her.

00:04.214 --> 00:06.591
Her body's
rejecting the radiation
on its own.

00:07.384 --> 00:08.176
Nightblood.

00:08.385 --> 00:09.302
You created
a killer.

00:09.511 --> 00:10.553
On the street,
they're calling her

00:10.762 --> 00:12.097
a Skairipa.

00:12.305 --> 00:14.891
Your decision-making has
grown increasingly questionable.

00:15.100 --> 00:16.935
I'm glad
you're still alive.

00:17.143 --> 00:18.687
I never meant to hurt anyone.

00:18.895 --> 00:22.107
Sword doesn't care
what you meant.
It just cuts.

00:22.315 --> 00:23.900
Pike stood right there.

00:24.109 --> 00:26.194
You do this and you're
no better than he was.

00:32.742 --> 00:34.285
There's a darkness
in you, Octavia.

00:34.494 --> 00:36.621
It's the end
of the world, Kane.

00:36.830 --> 00:38.748
Darkness is all we have left.

01:26.379 --> 01:27.422
Why are you
following me?

01:29.841 --> 01:31.217
You won't survive
out here alone.

01:33.136 --> 01:34.763
Let me help you.

01:35.263 --> 01:36.598
You've
helped enough.

01:44.022 --> 01:46.816
You spared my life.
I owe you.

01:50.236 --> 01:51.780
I don't want
anything from you.

02:05.960 --> 02:07.087
Get on.

02:07.295 --> 02:08.088
What is it?

02:08.296 --> 02:09.130
Now!

02:10.924 --> 02:12.133
Go, Helios!

02:33.905 --> 02:34.823
Welcome back.

02:43.581 --> 02:45.083
Black rain.

02:45.291 --> 02:46.543
Everybody inside!

02:46.751 --> 02:48.211
Black rain!
Sound the alarm!

02:49.587 --> 02:52.715
This is not a drill!
Go inside the ark!

02:53.216 --> 02:54.801
Cover yourself.
Take this.

02:55.510 --> 02:56.469
Everybody inside!

02:56.678 --> 02:58.012
Kane, where's Octavia?

02:58.471 --> 03:00.765
Leave your things!
Everybody inside!

03:05.979 --> 03:07.230
Quickly!

03:13.027 --> 03:14.404
Let go of me!

03:40.680 --> 03:42.724
Kane.
Someone's outside.

03:46.102 --> 03:46.811
Come on.

03:47.562 --> 03:50.148
Louis.

03:50.356 --> 03:51.983
We're coming.

03:52.192 --> 03:55.445
Come on, come on.
I got you, I got you.
Come on.

03:59.490 --> 04:00.700
Aah!

04:09.209 --> 04:10.418
I need
to find Octavia.

04:10.627 --> 04:11.586
She's not here.

04:11.794 --> 04:12.962
She took off
hours ago.

04:13.379 --> 04:14.088
I gotta find her.

04:14.297 --> 04:15.006
Bellamy, look.

04:15.215 --> 04:16.174
We don't know
where she went.

04:16.382 --> 04:17.258
You just got back,
and the rover

04:17.467 --> 04:18.718
doesn't have
enough power to go

04:18.927 --> 04:19.844
- searching through the woods.
- The rain

04:20.053 --> 04:21.554
- will kill her.
- She's smart.

04:22.430 --> 04:24.307
You gotta trust that
she found shelter, OK?

05:08.518 --> 05:09.936
Remember the drill?

05:10.144 --> 05:11.688
All wet clothing
in the designated zone.

05:11.896 --> 05:13.106
How do we know
everyone made it in?

05:13.314 --> 05:14.357
My wife.
She was outside
the wall.

05:14.565 --> 05:15.733
I need to know
if she's OK.

05:15.942 --> 05:17.026
Check in with
your section leaders.

05:17.235 --> 05:18.444
We'll get a head count
as soon as we can.

05:18.653 --> 05:19.946
Hello?
Can anyone hear me?

05:20.154 --> 05:21.990
Look, we're caught in the rain,
and it burns.

05:22.198 --> 05:24.909
We're trapped in the rubble
just north of the factory crash.

05:25.118 --> 05:26.494
Please. Can anybody hear me?

05:27.996 --> 05:29.122
This is chancellor Kane.
I hear you.

05:29.330 --> 05:30.164
Can you hear me?

05:30.373 --> 05:32.000
Kane.
Kane, it's Mark Colton.

05:32.208 --> 05:34.627
Look, please, my son is
soaked with black rain.

05:34.836 --> 05:37.380
Please. You gotta help us.
Hurry!

05:46.597 --> 05:48.224
Aah!

05:53.604 --> 05:54.772
There's fresh water.

05:54.981 --> 05:56.774
Uhh!

05:58.151 --> 05:59.319
God, it burns.

06:17.378 --> 06:19.881
The black rain.
What does it mean?

06:20.882 --> 06:21.758
It means we're
stuck in here

06:21.966 --> 06:22.967
until the storm passes.

06:23.176 --> 06:24.302
Doesn't mean
we need to talk.

06:26.763 --> 06:28.097
I need to wash off
my horse.

06:35.897 --> 06:37.023
Why don't you
go make a fire?

06:37.440 --> 06:38.232
You're good
at that.

06:42.904 --> 06:44.530
This is Becca's
main research lab,

06:44.739 --> 06:45.990
but there are 5 other levels.

06:56.501 --> 06:57.502
Incredible.

07:08.596 --> 07:10.139
God, it's
really you.

07:10.348 --> 07:11.808
I'll go check
on Raven and Luna.

07:15.353 --> 07:16.145
Where's Roan?

07:16.479 --> 07:18.314
He's unloading the fuel
with the others.

07:19.440 --> 07:20.900
I just needed
to see my mom.

07:27.740 --> 07:29.033
Don't punish
yourself.

07:30.493 --> 07:32.453
Going to space was
at best a long shot.

07:33.579 --> 07:34.997
It was the only
shot we had.

07:38.501 --> 07:39.710
Is that Raven?

07:43.381 --> 07:45.466
She's sedated
in the bio lab.

07:45.675 --> 07:46.676
She had another seizure.

07:48.511 --> 07:49.178
Is that...

07:49.387 --> 07:50.596
An Ischemic stroke.

07:51.597 --> 07:53.141
Well, that means
it can heal, right?

07:54.684 --> 07:56.936
Yes. As long as
she takes it easy,

07:57.145 --> 07:58.604
she'll recover.

07:58.813 --> 08:01.065
She's almost as stubborn
as you are.

08:01.482 --> 08:04.110
And you?
How are you feeling?

08:04.652 --> 08:05.528
I'm fine.

08:08.614 --> 08:09.824
Mom, I spoke
to Jackson.

08:10.116 --> 08:11.492
He doesn't think
you're fine.

08:11.951 --> 08:13.619
When was the last
time you slept?

08:14.620 --> 08:16.831
Oh, I'll sleep
soon enough,

08:17.039 --> 08:17.957
one way or another.

08:19.625 --> 08:20.418
What is that?

08:20.585 --> 08:22.462
It's bone marrow.
Luna's.

08:24.046 --> 08:26.632
A theory that
Jackson and I agreed

08:26.841 --> 08:28.259
should remain untested.

08:30.428 --> 08:31.554
What theory?

08:32.346 --> 08:33.598
We can't
create Nightblood

08:33.806 --> 08:34.765
unless we go
to space.

08:36.184 --> 08:37.393
But Luna can.

08:38.311 --> 08:41.022
Theoretically, we can
inject ourselves

08:41.230 --> 08:42.273
with her bone marrow.

08:42.482 --> 08:44.025
Then we become
Nightbloods.

08:45.359 --> 08:46.068
Will it work?

08:46.277 --> 08:47.278
I think so.

08:48.237 --> 08:50.323
Then why'd you take
it off the table?

08:51.282 --> 08:52.867
Because the only way
to know if it works

08:53.075 --> 08:55.495
is to test it,
and that would mean....

08:55.703 --> 08:57.663
Exposing someone
to radiation.

09:00.333 --> 09:01.375
Can we do that here?

09:05.421 --> 09:06.130
Yes.

09:08.883 --> 09:10.801
Becca was trying to find
a cure for cancer

09:11.052 --> 09:12.428
using this
radiation chamber.

09:14.764 --> 09:15.598
Clarke...

09:17.892 --> 09:19.852
We would have to expose
a human being

09:20.061 --> 09:22.188
to enough radiation
that would implode

09:22.355 --> 09:24.065
every single cell
in their body.

09:24.732 --> 09:26.275
That's what's
coming for us.

09:26.901 --> 09:29.946
I know that, but
you just said it.

09:30.655 --> 09:32.114
We have no choice.

09:32.990 --> 09:35.368
No. We have
to make a choice.

09:37.662 --> 09:39.121
Who do we test?

09:39.747 --> 09:41.123
Emori, hey.

09:45.670 --> 09:47.672
I'm heading up
to the house.

09:47.880 --> 09:49.340
Does anyone want anything
while I'm up there?

09:49.549 --> 09:51.300
No, we're fine.
Thanks, Emori.

09:52.009 --> 09:54.720
Hold on.
Honey, you should
go with her.

09:54.929 --> 09:56.514
No.
I just got here.

09:56.722 --> 09:58.391
I want to be here
with you and help.

09:58.599 --> 09:59.600
There is nothing
for you

09:59.809 --> 10:00.893
to help me with
right now.

10:01.102 --> 10:02.853
It'll be 5 hours
before the samples

10:03.062 --> 10:04.230
are even ready
to be tested.

10:04.438 --> 10:06.274
OK. Go, take a shower,

10:06.816 --> 10:08.693
and we'll figure this out
when you get back.

10:09.860 --> 10:10.528
Go.

10:11.571 --> 10:12.363
OK.

10:14.740 --> 10:15.658
I'll lower
the drones.

10:25.668 --> 10:27.628
Shh, shh, shh.

10:28.170 --> 10:29.338
Just breathe, Louis.

10:42.685 --> 10:43.811
I need to get him
to med bay.

10:46.230 --> 10:47.189
Med bay's full.

10:48.816 --> 10:51.402
Even with treatment,
he wouldn't
survive this.

10:51.611 --> 10:52.737
Look, I know
it's difficult,

10:52.945 --> 10:54.196
but we need
to prioritize.

10:54.405 --> 10:56.574
I'm the reason he's
not gonna survive this.

10:56.782 --> 10:57.825
He reached for me,

10:58.034 --> 10:59.452
and I didn't
help him.

10:59.660 --> 11:01.120
So help him now.

11:01.329 --> 11:02.955
Make him as comfortable
as possible.

11:13.132 --> 11:14.675
Everyone else
accounted for?

11:15.593 --> 11:18.179
Jaha and Monty
reported in
from sector 5.

11:18.387 --> 11:20.973
All 200 of their
people are safe.

11:21.307 --> 11:22.725
The other sectors
are still counting.

11:24.560 --> 11:25.519
We're down two.

11:27.647 --> 11:28.731
Not for long.

11:36.989 --> 11:38.532
Bellamy, the fire
damage to that suit

11:38.741 --> 11:40.242
could cause tears
you can't see,

11:40.451 --> 11:41.744
much less seal.

11:41.952 --> 11:43.663
It's the best we got.

11:43.829 --> 11:45.373
That's Mark Colton
out there.

11:45.539 --> 11:48.125
I know him.
He's resourceful.

11:48.334 --> 11:49.710
Right now they're
under an overhang,

11:49.919 --> 11:50.795
out of the rain.

11:51.045 --> 11:52.421
His son Peter
was one of the 100.

11:53.589 --> 11:54.715
I'm doing this.

12:20.408 --> 12:22.743
Bellamy!
Bellamy, turn around!

12:22.952 --> 12:23.786
Uhh!

12:35.423 --> 12:36.924
Bellamy, what the hell happened?

12:39.844 --> 12:41.011
Bellamy.

12:45.599 --> 12:46.934
Aah!

12:47.143 --> 12:48.936
Bellamy, come in.

12:51.564 --> 12:54.191
You were right.
The suit's useless.

12:54.817 --> 12:57.653
You gotta come back in.
Bring the rover
to the airlock.

12:57.862 --> 12:58.779
Uhh.

12:58.946 --> 12:59.864
Bellamy, it's Mark.

13:00.072 --> 13:00.990
Are you there?

13:05.703 --> 13:07.663
Right here.

13:08.789 --> 13:09.707
Are you on the move yet?

13:09.915 --> 13:11.250
Peter doesn't look so good.

13:11.459 --> 13:12.877
He's been
through worse,

13:13.085 --> 13:14.462
we'll get through this, too.

13:16.839 --> 13:18.090
I'm on my way.

13:18.841 --> 13:20.801
Copy that, Bellamy. Thanks.

13:21.051 --> 13:22.762
Bellamy, go to
the private channel.

13:32.521 --> 13:35.024
No more lectures.
I can't find my sister,

13:35.232 --> 13:36.692
but I do know where they are.

13:41.781 --> 13:44.033
Bellamy, stop.
Listen to me.

13:49.038 --> 13:53.083
No unnecessary risks.
You come home safe.

13:54.084 --> 13:55.169
I got this.

14:10.100 --> 14:12.394
Raven says the
black rain will be here soon.

14:12.603 --> 14:13.687
Raven's right.

14:14.605 --> 14:16.941
I used to love the rain.
Now it terrifies me.

14:17.733 --> 14:19.693
I would have thought
nothing terrified you.

14:19.902 --> 14:21.612
Did I say
something wrong?

14:21.821 --> 14:23.948
No. I just

14:24.448 --> 14:26.408
hate this island,
that's all.

14:27.076 --> 14:28.118
Murphy said you
used to work here.

14:28.327 --> 14:29.370
Is that right?

14:29.578 --> 14:30.746
Something
like that.

14:32.915 --> 14:34.416
Scavenging tech
for Alie?

14:36.585 --> 14:38.546
I'm sorry.
Too many questions.

14:40.214 --> 14:41.841
Ignore me.
I'm just upset

14:42.049 --> 14:43.968
that our mission here
has failed.

14:44.677 --> 14:46.595
Hopefully your mother
will come up with
another way.

14:50.182 --> 14:51.433
You're just like her.

14:53.602 --> 14:55.729
Willing to do anything
to save your people.

14:57.064 --> 14:58.732
Skaikru's lucky
to have you.

14:59.275 --> 15:00.901
We're not just doing
this for Skaikru.

15:09.076 --> 15:09.910
We're at the treeline.

15:10.119 --> 15:11.161
Coming in.

15:11.745 --> 15:12.746
Copy that.
Drones down.

15:12.955 --> 15:13.789
You're good to go.

15:31.223 --> 15:33.517
♪♪ A really good
thing to me ♪♪

15:47.740 --> 15:48.407
You can cook?

15:48.616 --> 15:49.450
Uhh.

15:51.785 --> 15:52.912
You can read.

15:53.662 --> 15:55.205
Yeah, I know what
you're thinking,
Clarke.

15:55.414 --> 15:57.875
Why are all the good
ones taken, right?

15:58.334 --> 15:59.752
A good Randzi
is rare.

15:59.960 --> 16:02.379
John would be
celebrated by any clan.

16:02.922 --> 16:04.715
Yeah, he's
a real catch.

16:04.924 --> 16:05.841
Mmm.

16:06.091 --> 16:07.468
♪♪ Living in a paradox... ♪♪

16:07.676 --> 16:08.928

16:10.304 --> 16:11.221

16:12.932 --> 16:13.766
Wow.

16:20.272 --> 16:21.440
I'm gonna go
get cleaned up.

16:21.649 --> 16:22.650
Yeah, let me show you
where to go.

16:22.858 --> 16:23.567
Upstairs.

16:23.943 --> 16:24.860
Down the hall.

16:25.694 --> 16:26.987
♪♪ Hit me ♪♪

16:28.072 --> 16:29.114
Thanks.

16:33.619 --> 16:34.745
We're getting
out of here.

16:34.954 --> 16:35.663
What?

16:36.330 --> 16:37.039
Now? Why?

16:37.247 --> 16:38.707
I'll explain on
the way to the bunker.

16:38.916 --> 16:40.709
I already told you
the bunker's
not an answer.

16:41.210 --> 16:41.835
What's going on?
What, did you see

16:42.044 --> 16:43.462
something out
in the woods?

16:43.963 --> 16:44.797
Are the scavengers
back?

16:45.005 --> 16:46.173
Even scavengers
wouldn't do to me

16:46.382 --> 16:47.466
what your people
are about to.

16:47.675 --> 16:50.177
E-e-Emori, stop.
What the hell are you
talking about?

16:50.386 --> 16:52.972
They're gonna
sacrifice someone
to test Nightblood.

16:53.389 --> 16:54.807
Who do you think
that's gonna be,
huh?

16:55.224 --> 16:57.101
Clarke? Raven?

16:57.351 --> 16:58.978
I'm the outsider, John,
the Freikdrana.

16:59.186 --> 17:00.354
Hey, hey, hey,
slow down, slow down.

17:00.562 --> 17:01.772
Emori, look at me.

17:01.981 --> 17:03.482
Look at me. Breathe.

17:04.692 --> 17:06.443
Tell me everything.

18:50.506 --> 18:51.882
Murphy?

18:55.052 --> 18:56.303
Murphy, is that you?

19:32.339 --> 19:34.341
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Take it easy.

19:35.175 --> 19:36.343
Look, we need to talk.

19:36.885 --> 19:39.972
Quiet. There's someone here.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.293
Aah!

20:09.459 --> 20:10.878
John!

20:11.044 --> 20:12.963
John! John!

20:13.213 --> 20:14.298
John!

20:16.800 --> 20:17.634
Get the hell
off of her!

20:21.555 --> 20:22.264
Are you OK?

20:22.472 --> 20:23.557
Can you stand?

20:23.765 --> 20:24.766
Wait!

20:27.978 --> 20:29.062
He's mine.

20:29.271 --> 20:30.772
- Whoa, Emori.
- You son of a bitch!

20:30.981 --> 20:31.857
- Leave him, leave him.
- Get off of me.

20:32.065 --> 20:33.108
If we don't
kill him now,

20:33.317 --> 20:34.443
he will kill us.

20:35.235 --> 20:36.653
You know him?

20:36.862 --> 20:37.779
Baylis.

20:39.823 --> 20:41.533
She's lying.
You don't know me.

20:41.742 --> 20:42.993
You said
you'd kill me.

20:43.243 --> 20:44.620
Well, guess
what, Planhaka,

20:44.870 --> 20:45.871
I'm gonna
kill you.

20:46.038 --> 20:47.414
Hey, hey, hey,
don't move.

20:47.623 --> 20:49.625
Just let me go.
I'll leave the food,

20:49.875 --> 20:51.585
and you never have
to see me again.

20:51.793 --> 20:53.253
Is he alone?

20:53.462 --> 20:54.421
Not usually.

20:57.299 --> 20:58.508
Where are
the others?

20:59.843 --> 21:01.136
I don't know who
the hell you think--

21:01.345 --> 21:02.429
Stumucha!

21:03.513 --> 21:05.849
Uhh! Uhh!

21:06.058 --> 21:07.100
Emori!

21:10.312 --> 21:12.231
You don't know what
he did to me.

21:12.731 --> 21:14.691
No, and you can
tell me about it,

21:14.900 --> 21:16.818
but please, Emori,
if he's not alone,

21:17.027 --> 21:18.403
we need to know now.

21:18.612 --> 21:20.864
Here, Murphy,
take my gun.

21:21.823 --> 21:22.741
Now tie him up.

21:22.908 --> 21:24.368
There's a medicine
cabinet upstairs.

21:24.534 --> 21:26.036
Can I fix this?

21:26.203 --> 21:27.788
Murphy won't let
him go anywhere.

21:27.996 --> 21:28.830
Will you, Murphy?

21:29.039 --> 21:30.290
Not a chance.

21:31.083 --> 21:32.417
We're gonna have
some fun.

21:35.128 --> 21:37.547
Fine. Tie him up.

21:38.006 --> 21:39.633
But when he's
done talking,

21:40.092 --> 21:41.134
the kill is mine.

21:49.977 --> 21:51.019
Mark.
Come in.

21:51.645 --> 21:52.896
Coming up on factory station.

21:53.105 --> 21:54.189
Almost to you. Over.

21:57.317 --> 21:58.527
Guys, read me?

22:01.154 --> 22:02.614
Don't go quiet on me now.

22:02.823 --> 22:03.865
Gonna need a little
help navigating

22:04.074 --> 22:05.325
once I'm past the wreckage.

22:07.494 --> 22:09.705
Come on, come on, come on.

22:10.455 --> 22:11.456
Yeah, I'm here.

22:11.707 --> 22:13.000
We're northwest
of the salvage area

22:13.292 --> 22:14.334
at about 15 degrees.

22:14.543 --> 22:16.420
Just follow the--Peter!

22:18.755 --> 22:19.965
What's happening?
Are you OK?

22:21.758 --> 22:23.719
Peter, get below me. Bellamy!

22:23.927 --> 22:25.429
Mark, what's going on?

22:25.637 --> 22:27.222
The wind shifted.
The rain is blowing in.

22:27.431 --> 22:30.017
OK, you need to find something
to use for cover.

22:30.225 --> 22:31.518
There's nothing here.

22:31.768 --> 22:33.603
Look, I'm blocking it from Peter
as best as I can.

22:33.812 --> 22:34.855
Just hurry. Please!

22:35.105 --> 22:37.607
Look South.
You'll see my headlights
in two minutes. I'm--

22:47.284 --> 22:48.118
come on.

22:50.370 --> 22:52.873
Damn it.

23:02.924 --> 23:04.426
No! No!

23:06.511 --> 23:07.637
Bellamy,
I don't see the lights.

23:07.846 --> 23:09.056
Where are you?

23:12.184 --> 23:14.686
Just--just a minor delay.
Just--just hang on.

23:14.936 --> 23:16.688
No! No!
No, we can't!

23:16.897 --> 23:17.814
We can't!
How long?

23:17.981 --> 23:19.066
Bellamy, what's happening?

23:20.859 --> 23:22.527
Answer.
What minor delay?

23:26.615 --> 23:27.949
Stuck in the mud.

23:28.825 --> 23:30.452
Gonna use the winch
to get me out.

23:30.660 --> 23:32.162
Negative. Bellamy,

23:32.371 --> 23:35.207
you have no suit and I can hear
the rain over the radio.

23:35.874 --> 23:39.753
Please, just...Just wait
for the storm to pass.

23:40.045 --> 23:40.921
Is that clear?

23:42.506 --> 23:44.341
Bellamy!
Peter needs help now,

23:44.549 --> 23:45.258
right now!

23:45.467 --> 23:46.676
He can't breathe!

23:46.885 --> 23:48.595
If you go into that storm,

23:49.304 --> 23:52.265
3 people die instead of two.

23:52.599 --> 23:53.892
You're out of options.

23:55.352 --> 23:56.728
It's time to let go.

23:57.354 --> 23:58.188
You said you'd be here.

23:58.438 --> 23:59.731
Where the hell are you?

24:03.568 --> 24:05.195
What am I supposed
to tell them?

24:07.572 --> 24:08.782
The truth.

24:21.420 --> 24:23.588
Mark. Peter.

24:26.633 --> 24:27.968
I can't get to you.

24:28.635 --> 24:31.263
What? No.

24:31.430 --> 24:34.182
We'll come to you.
Please, I can carry him.

24:34.391 --> 24:37.060
It's too far, Mark.
You won't make it.

24:37.269 --> 24:39.146
We won't make it here!

24:39.354 --> 24:41.314
Look. I--I am sorry.
You just--

24:41.481 --> 24:43.733
your only chance is just
to wait a little longer,

24:43.942 --> 24:45.819
and when the rain stops,
I can dig out.

24:46.027 --> 24:47.946
My son is dying!

24:49.364 --> 24:51.450
He's dying right now.

24:51.700 --> 24:54.494
You said that you would help us.
Please!

25:00.542 --> 25:02.210
No! No!

25:17.976 --> 25:20.103
You did more damage
than you took.

25:20.979 --> 25:24.316
Not enough.
Not yet.

25:28.528 --> 25:30.947
Don't tell me
you've never killed
for revenge.

25:35.368 --> 25:39.706
Well, then, I guess
you're better than me,

25:39.873 --> 25:41.791
because I'm going to.

25:42.459 --> 25:44.586
But first I'm
gonna make him suffer

25:44.794 --> 25:46.546
for what he did to me
and my brother.

25:48.465 --> 25:50.759
I'm gonna cut him for
every time he cut me.

25:51.843 --> 25:54.179
I'm gonna make him beg
the way I begged.

25:54.346 --> 25:55.388
Emori.

25:57.015 --> 25:58.767
We're not gonna let him
hurt you again.

25:59.726 --> 26:01.686
I don't need you
to protect me, Clarke.

26:01.937 --> 26:04.648
I protect myself.
I always have.

26:04.856 --> 26:07.150
- I understand.
- Like hell you do.

26:07.984 --> 26:10.820
I was cast out
of my clan as an infant

26:11.029 --> 26:12.447
because of this.

26:14.115 --> 26:16.409
I was forced
to steal to survive.

26:17.035 --> 26:18.245
Forced to kill.

26:22.165 --> 26:24.000
You were loved.

26:24.459 --> 26:27.003
Told you were special.

26:28.421 --> 26:30.674
I was thrown away
like someone's garbage.

26:33.802 --> 26:35.720
You know nothing
of my pain.

26:36.137 --> 26:38.640
No. I don't.

26:39.975 --> 26:41.601
But I do know
what it feels like

26:41.893 --> 26:43.645
to think you have no
choice but to kill.

26:43.853 --> 26:45.021
You think I have
a choice?

26:45.272 --> 26:46.231
If we let
Baylis live,

26:46.439 --> 26:47.816
he will come back.

26:48.024 --> 26:50.735
Nothing will stop him
from punishing me
for leaving.

26:50.944 --> 26:52.696
If we show even
the slightest hesitation,

26:52.904 --> 26:53.947
he will use it.

26:54.155 --> 26:55.907
He will say anything
to survive.

26:56.074 --> 26:57.576
And the second we
let our guard down,

26:57.742 --> 26:59.035
he will strike.

26:59.244 --> 27:00.954
He will kill
us all.

27:03.290 --> 27:05.667
But I am not gonna let
that happen, Clarke,

27:05.875 --> 27:07.544
because today,

27:07.752 --> 27:09.588
I am the commander
of death.

27:17.971 --> 27:19.931
I only came here
for the food.

27:20.390 --> 27:21.725
Things I can trade.

27:22.517 --> 27:24.936
I scavenge so
my family can eat.
Please.

27:25.186 --> 27:27.272
That's it.

27:27.480 --> 27:28.815
Find the right angle.

27:30.650 --> 27:31.735
I'll help you out.

27:32.402 --> 27:35.655
I love someone who
was beaten and tortured

27:35.864 --> 27:37.824
by a man who thought
he could control her.

27:38.033 --> 27:39.451
I'm not that man.

27:40.660 --> 27:41.911
You can torture me
all you want,

27:42.120 --> 27:43.121
and that won't change
the fact--

27:43.330 --> 27:44.372
uhh!

27:45.749 --> 27:46.499
Uhh!

27:48.543 --> 27:51.296
Who's the scared
child now, Baylis?

27:52.881 --> 27:54.633
For my brother.

27:54.841 --> 27:56.051
Uhh! For me!

27:56.259 --> 27:57.469
Uhh!

27:57.677 --> 28:00.680
Uhh!
Uhh! Uhh!

28:00.889 --> 28:02.098
- Wait.
- What?

28:02.307 --> 28:03.099
You'll kill him.

28:03.266 --> 28:04.392
That's the idea.

28:04.601 --> 28:05.518
Why don't you
stay out of it

28:05.727 --> 28:07.062
and let her have
this, Clarke?

28:14.527 --> 28:16.529
What if his death
could save us all?

28:30.418 --> 28:31.670
Where
will you go

28:32.170 --> 28:33.546
when the storm passes?

28:40.345 --> 28:41.638
I don't know, either.

28:42.305 --> 28:44.516
If I go home, I'll see
their faces everywhere.

28:46.935 --> 28:48.144
In everything.

28:50.522 --> 28:52.482
The windmill I helped
my father build

28:52.691 --> 28:54.317
to grind the corn
for the sheep.

28:55.443 --> 28:57.862
The room I shared
with my brother.

28:59.364 --> 29:00.407
The fence...

29:03.201 --> 29:05.370
The fence I tied
my mother to...

29:07.539 --> 29:08.957
Before I cut off
her fingers.

29:13.586 --> 29:15.213
Before I cut
my father's throat.

29:16.881 --> 29:18.341
Before I cut my
brother's throat.

29:18.717 --> 29:20.218
Go home, Ilian.

29:21.219 --> 29:22.846
You're not a murderer.

29:23.054 --> 29:24.180
You feel the way
you're supposed to feel

29:24.389 --> 29:26.099
after you take a life.

29:26.307 --> 29:27.851
I feel nothing.

29:28.059 --> 29:29.686
Now go back to your
stupid sheep.

29:31.980 --> 29:32.939
I don't
believe you.

29:33.148 --> 29:34.107
I saw the pain
in your face

29:34.315 --> 29:36.359
when you aimed that
gun at my head.

29:37.068 --> 29:37.694
We're done talking.

29:37.902 --> 29:39.654
You may not want
to feel it,

29:40.739 --> 29:41.948
but it's there.

29:43.408 --> 29:44.659
I should've pulled
the trigger.

29:44.868 --> 29:45.952
- Why didn't you?
- Just shut up.

29:46.161 --> 29:46.911
You think you're
a killer, but

29:47.162 --> 29:48.413
you couldn't
kill me.

29:48.663 --> 29:49.664
Whatever escape
from the pain

29:49.873 --> 29:51.458
you were looking for

29:51.666 --> 29:52.917
wasn't there
anymore.

29:56.129 --> 29:57.964
I told you my sad story.

29:58.465 --> 29:59.758
Tell me yours.

30:00.383 --> 30:01.259
What made you
like this?

30:01.468 --> 30:02.677
Just shut up!

30:16.524 --> 30:18.943
I think the person
you were before
this happened...

30:20.195 --> 30:21.279
Is still in there.

30:28.077 --> 30:28.953
You're wrong.

30:37.670 --> 30:38.671
Octavia.

30:45.261 --> 30:46.304
Octavia, no!

30:46.513 --> 30:48.014
- Uhh!
- No!

30:48.473 --> 30:50.683
- Uhh!
- No! I need this!

30:51.184 --> 30:52.560
I need this!

30:52.769 --> 30:53.812
Let me go!

30:54.020 --> 30:55.980
I needed this
to happen!

30:56.189 --> 30:57.565
Let me go!

30:58.024 --> 31:00.109
- Stop!
- I should have killed you.

31:00.860 --> 31:02.529
Stop!

31:09.369 --> 31:11.079
- Stop.
- Let me up.

31:11.871 --> 31:12.831
Stop.

31:14.332 --> 31:15.458
Stop.

31:37.689 --> 31:39.440
Just make me feel
something else.

31:45.655 --> 31:46.614
Octavia.

32:17.145 --> 32:20.106
Abby, are you there? Come in.

32:22.817 --> 32:23.902
I'm here.

32:24.903 --> 32:26.613
Ah, it's
so good to hear
your voice.

32:27.238 --> 32:30.867
I have bad news, Abby.
The black rain's here.

32:32.785 --> 32:34.162
It's worse
than we thought.

32:35.872 --> 32:39.626
It, uh--it burns
on contact.

32:40.168 --> 32:42.629
It kills.
After today,

32:43.755 --> 32:45.006
the water
won't be drinkable.

32:45.214 --> 32:47.300
We lost what we
had stored in the fire.

32:48.343 --> 32:50.136
We have enough for a couple
of weeks, but after that--

32:50.303 --> 32:52.639
I know what happens
after that.

32:52.847 --> 32:54.015
We need a solution.

32:58.978 --> 33:00.688
Abby, are you there?

33:01.272 --> 33:02.231
I'm here.

33:03.942 --> 33:05.693
There may be a solution.

33:08.237 --> 33:10.281
- That's great.
- But to find it,

33:10.490 --> 33:11.824
I have to do something
that I never thought

33:11.991 --> 33:13.284
I'd have to do.

33:15.870 --> 33:17.497
You'll make
the right decision.

33:17.705 --> 33:18.581
You always do.

33:20.875 --> 33:22.251
Can I ask you something?

33:22.752 --> 33:23.628
Anything.

33:25.296 --> 33:29.717
If I take a life...
To find a cure...

33:31.511 --> 33:33.012
Does that make me a murderer?

33:36.307 --> 33:38.142
Abby, I...

33:40.228 --> 33:41.854
I don't know how to answer that.
I wish I did.

33:42.021 --> 33:43.648
What if it can save us all?

33:46.150 --> 33:48.111
Would I be able
to live with myself then?

33:51.614 --> 33:54.033
Taking a life
should never be easy.

33:56.035 --> 33:57.495
I hope it's not easy for you.

34:00.039 --> 34:02.125
Your humanity is
your greatest strength.

34:03.001 --> 34:06.004
Sometimes we need
a different kind
of strength.

34:07.046 --> 34:08.423
We need to survive.

34:09.590 --> 34:12.010
Then we can all find
our humanity again.

34:12.677 --> 34:14.095
I hope
you're right, Marcus.

34:19.392 --> 34:20.351
No.

34:28.234 --> 34:30.403
Mark, Peter?

34:30.695 --> 34:31.863
I have to go.

34:32.030 --> 34:33.823
- Be safe.
- You, too, Abby.

34:34.073 --> 34:36.117
The rain's on its way out.

34:36.325 --> 34:37.535
You still with me?

34:43.082 --> 34:44.542
Hey, Mark, come in.

34:44.751 --> 34:45.793
Do you read me?

34:48.963 --> 34:51.049
As soon as this rain clears,

34:51.257 --> 34:53.634
I'm out of this ditch
and I'm on my way.

34:54.802 --> 34:56.512
Please tell me
that you read me.

35:09.192 --> 35:10.234
Bellamy...

35:13.112 --> 35:14.280
You did your best.

35:21.537 --> 35:23.706
I failed.
They're dead.

35:23.915 --> 35:25.083
It's not your fault.

35:25.291 --> 35:26.751
I can't protect anyone.

35:29.337 --> 35:30.880
I couldn't protect
my sister.

35:32.423 --> 35:34.425
My responsibility,
and I failed.

35:35.927 --> 35:36.969
My mom passed out.

35:38.805 --> 35:41.224
She was there.
She was in my hands.

35:41.641 --> 35:45.603
She was so helpless,
and now what is she?

35:45.853 --> 35:50.024
Is she even alive?
What is she? I--

35:51.275 --> 35:52.735
you didn't fail, Bellamy.

35:54.028 --> 35:56.489
You did everything
you could for her.

35:57.824 --> 35:59.408
You came to the ground for her.

36:01.369 --> 36:03.955
You can't save someone
who doesn't want to be saved.

36:09.252 --> 36:11.295
Your mother would be proud
of the man you've become.

36:13.381 --> 36:14.382
I know I am.

36:18.761 --> 36:20.304
You floated my mother.

36:49.542 --> 36:53.087
Who you want to be
doesn't always win.

37:23.159 --> 37:24.660
Storm's over.

37:24.869 --> 37:26.454
Yeah.

37:34.629 --> 37:36.214
You have somewhere
to go now?

37:36.797 --> 37:37.840
I'm going home.

37:40.301 --> 37:41.886
Back to my
stupid sheep.

37:46.432 --> 37:48.476
Walk into the setting sun,
and you'll find it.
