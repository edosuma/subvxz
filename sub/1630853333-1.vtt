through this past year

1:19:37.046 --> 1:19:38.474
was knowing that I was going
to be the one to find you.

1:19:39.411 --> 1:19:41.345
That I would get all the answers

1:19:41.380 --> 1:19:44.183
to the questions
that keep gnawing at me.

1:19:44.218 --> 1:19:46.889
Farhan, he was set up
so that I'd bring you in here.

1:19:49.157 --> 1:19:51.289
It was a drone strike,
wasn't it?

1:19:51.324 --> 1:19:52.587
The hospital bombing.

1:19:53.590 --> 1:19:56.492
My husband.
My little girl.

1:19:57.297 --> 1:20:00.496
186 people died that day

1:20:00.531 --> 1:20:04.302
because someone at the CIA
ordered a drone strike.

1:20:04.337 --> 1:20:06.436
And I don't know
if it was intentional,

1:20:06.671 --> 1:20:08.405
but Silas sent you in
to cover it up.

1:20:08.440 --> 1:20:13.080
It was...it was a mistake to
assign you to this case, Abby.

1:20:13.348 --> 1:20:15.577
Your report started
the whole fucking thing.

1:20:15.979 --> 1:20:18.415
Working out it was a drone
and not a bomb.

1:20:19.924 --> 1:20:21.957
You're actually
a very good analyst, Abby.

1:20:22.192 --> 1:20:25.092
We clearly didn't fucking
count on you uncovering this.

1:20:26.392 --> 1:20:28.128
Is that where you come in?

1:20:28.163 --> 1:20:30.229
To take me, my sources,
and all the intel out?

1:20:30.264 --> 1:20:31.626
What can I say?

1:20:31.861 --> 1:20:33.661
Hey, the agency
assigns you your cases,

1:20:33.696 --> 1:20:34.937
they assigned me mine.

1:20:36.974 --> 1:20:40.272
You were ordered to murder
a base full of people?

1:20:41.209 --> 1:20:43.275
You're fucking out of your mind!

1:20:43.310 --> 1:20:44.540
And it's gonna end right here.

1:20:45.180 --> 1:20:46.542
Then what?

1:20:46.577 --> 1:20:50.183
Huh? You think I'm the only--
the only Hatchet? Huh?

1:20:50.218 --> 1:20:51.382
There were others fucking
before me,

1:20:51.417 --> 1:20:53.252
there'll be many others after.

1:20:55.718 --> 1:20:57.454
And all that evidence
you're gathering,

1:20:57.489 --> 1:20:59.456
safely stored downstairs...

1:21:02.428 --> 1:21:04.032
Hey, you're old friend Tessa,

1:21:04.067 --> 1:21:06.067
she's takin'
care of that right about...

1:21:06.903 --> 1:21:08.168
- <i> ...now.</i>

1:21:12.504 --> 1:21:13.404
<i>It's over, all right?</i>

1:21:14.140 --> 1:21:17.177
Yeah? None of it
fucking matters.

1:21:17.946 --> 1:21:21.445
So just, I'll get Silas
to go along with our story,

1:21:21.480 --> 1:21:22.644
we'll be each others witness.

1:21:22.679 --> 1:21:24.085
All right, come on.

1:21:24.120 --> 1:21:25.086
You're not a killer.

1:21:25.621 --> 1:21:27.583
- We're on the same team.
- Right.

1:21:28.252 --> 1:21:31.224
Let's...let's bring
each other home.

1:21:34.757 --> 1:21:36.966
I've spent every hour
of every day wondering

1:21:37.001 --> 1:21:39.001
what happened to them
at the end,

1:21:39.036 --> 1:21:40.970
and now you're fucking
gonna find out.

1:21:43.106 --> 1:21:45.469
You think you can...you think
you can just walk away?

1:21:45.771 --> 1:21:47.207
Huh? There's nowhere
you can run,

1:21:47.242 --> 1:21:49.110
there's nowhere
you can fucking hide!

1:21:49.145 --> 1:21:50.474
They'll find you!

1:21:50.509 --> 1:21:52.674
- I'm not gonna hide.
- Silas, you, me.

1:21:52.709 --> 1:21:54.610
- I'm going to find them first.
- We're all the same,

1:21:54.645 --> 1:21:56.051
we followed orders!

1:21:56.086 --> 1:21:57.987
I won't die today!

1:21:58.022 --> 1:21:59.747
I won't fucking die!

1:21:59.782 --> 1:22:01.958
I am death, you hear me?
