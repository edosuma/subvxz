10:30.773 --> 10:32.153

10:32.253 --> 10:34.273

that the only way

10:34.373 --> 10:36.073
he would consider joint custody
at Christmas

10:36.173 --> 10:37.672
would be if you were
to undertake

10:37.772 --> 10:39.772

10:41.492 --> 10:42.952
- Sorry, what?

10:43.052 --> 10:45.031

10:45.131 --> 10:48.191
- Well, then I want him
to do regular drug testing,

10:48.291 --> 10:52.270
because I have evidence
of him doing drugs in the past.

10:52.370 --> 10:53.590

What?

10:53.690 --> 10:55.390
- Well, not evidence,

10:55.490 --> 10:57.189
but inasmuch as I've seen him...

10:57.289 --> 10:58.989
- Okay.
- Doing them.

10:59.089 --> 11:01.269
- Because obviously,
in your case,

11:01.369 --> 11:04.228
there is public record
of presumed drug taking,

11:04.328 --> 11:05.588
which is tiresome,

11:05.688 --> 11:06.828
but could come up
before a court.

11:06.928 --> 11:09.188
- Right.
So it looks bad if I say no.

within your rights.

11:30.644 --> 11:32.104

the drug test involved

11:32.204 --> 11:34.584
is a hair follicle test
which dates back

11:34.684 --> 11:37.443

11:40.523 --> 11:41.863
- Mm-hmm.
Uh-huh.

11:41.963 --> 11:44.222
- So our advice to you

11:44.322 --> 11:45.902
would be to consider that

11:46.002 --> 11:50.461
and whether that's worth
seeing Frank on Christmas Day.

into a very time-rich case.
