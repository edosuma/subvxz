Hello? Yes, Buck, it's Dr Crane.

00:11.447 --> 00:13.403
I'm calling to see if the cabin
is ready for us.

00:13.607 --> 00:16.599
Uh, You got the case of Montrachet?
Good. Good.

00:16.767 --> 00:19.486
And the Thanksgiving feast
will be delivered promptly at 3?

00:19.647 --> 00:23.686
Good. The woodpile's
been thoroughly inspected for spiders?

00:24.487 --> 00:26.079
Excellent. Thank you.

00:26.247 --> 00:30.604
Well, we're ready to rough it
in the great Northwest.

00:31.127 --> 00:33.243
If you don't mind my asking,
you taking anything along

00:33.407 --> 00:36.285
- to keep your nephew amused?
- Yes, his grandfather.

00:37.087 --> 00:40.238
Oh, by the way, what time tomorrow
are Frederick and Lilith flying in?

00:40.447 --> 00:42.881
Her broom touches down at 11.

00:44.247 --> 00:45.885
All right, now,
when you mist the plants,

00:46.047 --> 00:49.164
be sure that the water is not too cold.
I know I'm harping on and on about this,

00:49.327 --> 00:51.636
but I know you're not used to
dealing with delicate flowers.

00:51.807 --> 00:54.446
I've produced your show
for three years, haven't I?

00:55.207 --> 00:58.040
I'll leave you a number at Niles' cabin
in case anything goes wrong.

00:58.247 --> 01:00.681
Oh, yes, and by the way,
I frown on overnight guests.

01:00.887 --> 01:03.276
Then you're not doing it right.

01:06.167 --> 01:08.556
I'll leave you my number
in San Francisco too.

01:08.927 --> 01:10.440
You're not going to the cabin
with them?

01:10.607 --> 01:12.598
Daphne's decided to spend
a traditional Thanksgiving

01:12.767 --> 01:15.804
with her transvestite uncle, Jackie.

01:16.487 --> 01:18.318
Come on, Roz,
I'll show you around the kitchen.

01:18.487 --> 01:21.399
So this uncle of yours, does he dress
like a woman all the time?

01:21.567 --> 01:26.197
Oh, certainly not for work. His
congregation would never stand for it.

[NILES GROANS]

01:29.007 --> 01:32.602
- What's wrong?
- Oh, just a little depressed.

01:32.807 --> 01:34.684
This is my first Thanksgiving
without Maris.

01:34.847 --> 01:36.963
Oh, yeah. I know, son, it's hard.

01:37.367 --> 01:40.439
Remember the year I plopped
that big wedge of pumpkin pie

01:40.607 --> 01:43.599
in front of her, and we all laughed?

01:44.167 --> 01:46.476
Then I put a big scoop
of whipped cream on top of it,

01:46.647 --> 01:48.717
and we laughed some more.

01:49.247 --> 01:52.284
Then her eyes welled up with tears,
and we all knew it was time to stop.

01:52.447 --> 01:54.403
Yes.

01:54.727 --> 01:56.001
If it makes you feel any better,

01:56.167 --> 01:58.362
I won't be having my dream
Thanksgiving either.

01:58.687 --> 02:00.962
Why does Lilith
have to tag along anyway?

02:01.127 --> 02:02.799
She didn't wanna spend
the holiday alone.

02:02.967 --> 02:04.923
Her husband is in New Zealand,
exploring a volcano.

02:05.127 --> 02:07.846
- Why couldn't she go with him?
- Because if she accidentally fell in,

02:08.007 --> 02:10.601
the shock wave from the hottest thing
in nature meeting the coldest

02:10.767 --> 02:12.962
would actually crack the Earth in two.

02:17.687 --> 02:21.646
As if a smile from Maris
couldn't freeze Mercury.

02:21.847 --> 02:24.839
Guys, let it go.
Nobody's gonna win this one.

[PHONE RINGING]

02:28.607 --> 02:30.006
Hello?

02:30.207 --> 02:31.435
Yes, Lilith.

02:31.607 --> 02:32.756
Yes, Lilith.

02:32.927 --> 02:36.442
- Yes, Lilith.
- Gee, it's like they were still married.

02:36.647 --> 02:39.684
If you change the paper towels,
he likes the flap facing the front.

02:39.847 --> 02:42.156
If you change the bathroom tissue,
the flap faces the back.

02:42.327 --> 02:43.885
Don't ask me why.

02:44.087 --> 02:46.840
- Don't know how you live with him.
- Don't know how you work with him.

02:47.007 --> 02:48.918
Well, I have learned a trick.

02:49.127 --> 02:52.324
When he's really bugging me,
I ask if he hasn't lost a little weight.

02:52.487 --> 02:54.398
Before you know it,
he's checking his butt out

02:54.567 --> 02:56.205
in the glass at the candy machine.

02:56.407 --> 02:58.204
Really? I tell him he's gained weight.

02:58.367 --> 03:01.723
He skips dinner, sulks in his room, and
I have the whole evening to myself.

03:01.887 --> 03:03.036
Oh, good.

03:03.247 --> 03:06.956
Okay, you tell Frederick I said bravo.

03:07.167 --> 03:10.557
Frederick just passed the qualifying
exam for the Marbury Academy!

Oh, Dad. Oh, Dad, please.

03:25.847 --> 03:30.159
No, the Marbury Academy is the most
exclusive private school in all of Boston.

03:30.367 --> 03:32.517
It's a breeding ground
of power and privilege.

03:32.727 --> 03:34.797
Lilith and I have to be interviewed
by the headmaster.

03:34.967 --> 03:37.435
He's got a busy schedule.
He has agreed to see us Thanksgiving.

03:37.607 --> 03:39.040
This, of course, changes our plans.

03:39.247 --> 03:40.999
Wait. You mean I don't get to see
my grandson?

03:41.207 --> 03:43.846
Of course you do. We'll move our
Thanksgiving celebration to Boston.

03:44.007 --> 03:45.759
- I'll call the airline.
- I'd better cancel

03:45.927 --> 03:49.078
our rustic Thanksgiving.
Hello, Buck, it's Dr Crane.

03:49.247 --> 03:51.966
Take the mints off the pillows.

03:57.087 --> 03:59.681

MARTIN: Good boy.

- Hi, Lilith, how you doing?
- Happy Thanksgiving, Lilith.

04:06.887 --> 04:08.081
Martin. Niles.

04:08.247 --> 04:11.045
Nice neighbourhood. I noticed a whole
bunch of kids Freddie's age

04:11.207 --> 04:12.686
- playing in the street.
- Yes.

04:12.887 --> 04:16.800
He's spent many happy hours at his
window observing their play patterns.

04:17.726 --> 04:21.800
Niles, I'm afraid, with this interview,
I'm running a little behind schedule,

04:21.966 --> 04:24.083
so I'm enlisting you to help
with the turkey.

04:24.407 --> 04:27.763
Oh, well, I've never cooked a turkey
before, but the recipe's here.

04:27.927 --> 04:30.566
I guess I can fumble my way through.
How far along are you?

04:30.767 --> 04:32.997
I'm nearly done defrosting.

04:34.687 --> 04:36.359
And the turkey?

04:39.447 --> 04:42.439
Might I suggest you stuff it?

04:42.927 --> 04:47.955
So the rabbit says to the bear,
"No, no. I said, 'Oedipal' not 'edible."'

04:48.127 --> 04:50.197
Good one, Dad.

04:50.567 --> 04:52.285

- You're late.

to you too.

Now, Mommy and Daddy have
to run off to this meeting.

04:58.887 --> 05:01.560
After that, I'm all yours. Meanwhile,
why don't you head on upstairs

05:01.767 --> 05:03.519
and show Granddad and Niles
your new computer?

05:03.687 --> 05:05.484

MARTIN: Come on, sport.

05:05.647 --> 05:07.399
My God, are you half as nervous
as I am?

05:07.567 --> 05:10.639
- And then some.
- We have got to master our nerves.

05:10.847 --> 05:14.522
It is vital that we appear to be
well-adjusted, responsible parents.

05:14.727 --> 05:18.436
Lilith, do you still keep the Valium
with the contraceptives?

05:19.047 --> 05:22.756
Sorry, I needed the last one just
to go in and pick up the application.

05:23.487 --> 05:26.081
I'll assume you meant the Valium.

05:29.287 --> 05:30.515
Perhaps before the interview

05:30.687 --> 05:34.362
you should sheathe
that butter-knife-sharp wit of yours.

05:34.567 --> 05:36.558
Perhaps we could find
the appropriate kitchen tool

05:36.727 --> 05:39.878
to ratchet down that bun of yours
a notch or two.

05:40.447 --> 05:43.245
Frasier, stop.
We should be focusing on our son.

05:43.407 --> 05:45.682
You're right, of course.
We've always had our differences,

05:45.847 --> 05:47.963
but we've put them aside
for the welfare of Frederick.

05:48.167 --> 05:51.842
This may be the most important thing
we ever do to ensure his happiness.

05:52.047 --> 05:54.197
Not counting our divorce.

05:55.407 --> 05:57.477
Freddie's gonna break in
this new mitt I bought him.

Now, wait. Where do you
keep your saffron?

06:09.647 --> 06:11.683
- Third cupboard.
- Um-hmm. Where are your shallots?

06:11.847 --> 06:14.600
In the crisper. By the way,
you still have to remove the entrails

06:14.767 --> 06:15.961
from the chest cavity.

06:17.527 --> 06:20.360
In that case, where do you keep
your ten-foot pole?

All right, Mommy and Daddy
are going to see

06:24.567 --> 06:28.845
that you're wearing a Marbury blazer,
or die trying.

06:29.247 --> 06:31.124
Dad, maybe you
should remove the entrails.

No can do.
Freddie and I are gonna play catch.

the colour has drained from my face.

- No, no, no, you can use a pinch.

off what I thought was on my jacket.

nuance and the occasional virus.

there's just one question

11:00.287 --> 11:02.642
- I wish we'd answered differently.
- Which one?

11:02.847 --> 11:04.963
Remember, he mentioned
Frederick was being courted

11:05.127 --> 11:06.355
by other schools?

11:06.527 --> 11:08.165
I wonder if we shouldn't have
made it clear

11:08.327 --> 11:10.887
that Marbury is far and away
our first choice.

11:11.087 --> 11:13.726
Frasier, if you overanalyse
every detail,

11:13.887 --> 11:16.037
you will rob us
of the joy of the moment.

11:16.207 --> 11:19.324
It will be our wedding night
all over again.

11:21.047 --> 11:23.242
Speaking of hard-to-explain bruises...

11:23.407 --> 11:27.161
Yes, well, you're right. You're right,
of course. I'm sure everything's fine.

11:27.327 --> 11:31.764
Unless we didn't convey to him
how highly we regard Marbury.

11:31.967 --> 11:33.161
Well, see, that is my worry.

11:33.647 --> 11:36.286
We must correct this.
What should I say?

11:36.447 --> 11:39.917
Oh, Lilith, stop! Stop! Remember what
happened when the senator called?

11:40.927 --> 11:43.282
- We need... We need a ruse.
LILITH: You're right.

11:43.487 --> 11:44.681
How's this?

11:44.887 --> 11:48.084
We go back, and I say that I lost
my earring in his living room.

11:48.287 --> 11:50.084
While looking for it,
we casually mention

11:50.247 --> 11:52.397
that Marbury
is Frederick's first and only choice.

11:52.567 --> 11:53.920
- Perfect.
- Let's go.

11:55.207 --> 11:57.926

[DOORBELL CHIMES]

12:04.487 --> 12:07.206
Ah, yes, Dr Campbell, I hope we're
not disturbing anything important.

12:07.367 --> 12:10.404
Actually, I'm a bit frazzled trying to get
my Thanksgiving dinner together.

12:10.567 --> 12:13.479
I'm afraid I lost an earring
here this morning.

12:13.687 --> 12:16.042
Well, I'll have a look around
and call you if it turns up.

12:16.207 --> 12:17.879
- Well, um...
- Uh, do you think

12:18.047 --> 12:19.924
I might be able
to take a peek right now?

12:20.087 --> 12:25.286
I wouldn't even think of asking, but it
was a treasured gift from Golda Meir.

12:27.367 --> 12:29.881
- Very well.
- Thank you.

12:30.047 --> 12:34.404
Forgive me, I must turn the heat down
on the pumpkin soup.

12:34.607 --> 12:37.041
We rehearsed everything
we were going to say on the ride over.

12:37.207 --> 12:39.596
Where the hell did Golda Meir
come from?

12:39.807 --> 12:43.163
I admit it wasn't half
as clever as "um."

12:44.327 --> 12:46.158
- But it got us in.
- Mm-hmm.

12:46.327 --> 12:48.761
- Any luck?
- Not yet.

12:50.047 --> 12:54.040
We're so sorry about this. The whole
ride over here we kept saying:

12:54.527 --> 12:58.236
"Why did this have to happen at
the only school that matters to us?"

12:58.447 --> 13:01.120
Yes, as you know,
Marbury is our first choice.

13:01.287 --> 13:03.323
Oh, look, here it is.

13:03.847 --> 13:06.361
- That was lucky.
- Remarkably so.

13:06.567 --> 13:09.286
Considering that wasn't the chair
you were sitting in.

13:09.447 --> 13:10.766
- Um...
- Well, I suppose it's time

13:10.927 --> 13:13.122
we be shoving off.

13:13.287 --> 13:16.438
I'm curious. I've always been
a great admirer of Mrs Meir.

13:16.607 --> 13:18.325
How did you meet?

13:18.687 --> 13:21.963
Oh, well, it's a funny story.

13:22.127 --> 13:23.924
Oh, yes. Yeah.

13:24.567 --> 13:27.206
Frasier, you tell it
much better than I do.

13:30.407 --> 13:34.525
Oh, yes. Yes.
It was back in college days.

13:34.687 --> 13:38.043
Lilith spent a summer at a kibbutz

13:38.207 --> 13:42.086
and was dating her grandson, Oscar.

13:45.407 --> 13:48.285
That would be Oscar Meir?

13:49.767 --> 13:52.327
Yes. Well, just imagine
the ribbing he took.

13:52.487 --> 13:56.605
Indeed. Well, it's so good
to see you both again.

13:56.767 --> 14:00.203
Enjoy your Thanksgiving.
Marbury thanks you for your interest.

14:00.407 --> 14:02.796
Wait. Wait a minute.
"Marbury thanks you for your interest."

14:02.967 --> 14:04.559
- We know what that means.
- Oh, good.

14:04.767 --> 14:07.964
Then you'll have no trouble
interpreting this.

14:09.647 --> 14:12.878
You had to give him gum, didn't you?

14:14.127 --> 14:16.357
Not just gum, bubble gum.

14:16.527 --> 14:19.121
Maybe what threw him off is having
to breathe through his mouth

14:19.287 --> 14:20.959
while he chewed it.

14:21.127 --> 14:24.119
You know, Frederick, when I was a
boy nothing brought a smile to my face

14:24.287 --> 14:27.962
like when Mother would make
a rëmoulade and let me lick the spoon.

14:28.167 --> 14:29.725
- Thanks, Uncle Niles.
- You're welcome.

14:29.887 --> 14:32.276
You think maybe
I should trim his bangs a little bit?

14:32.447 --> 14:36.042
Maybe you should put the scissors
down while he still has one good eye.

14:37.007 --> 14:38.326
Uh-oh.

14:38.647 --> 14:42.276
- Is there anchovies in this?
- Yes.

14:42.487 --> 14:46.162
Oh, my God, I've never seen hives
break out that fast.

14:50.087 --> 14:52.317
I got pills for everything.

14:56.807 --> 15:01.642
Of all the names in the universe,
you had to pick "Oscar."

15:03.047 --> 15:06.198
You started us down that path
of insanity.

Golda Meir. Golda my ass!

15:11.687 --> 15:13.996
This sniping is pointless.

15:14.167 --> 15:16.556
Getting into Marbury
was a long shot anyway.

15:16.727 --> 15:17.921
You heard the man.

15:18.087 --> 15:22.365
Most of these openings go to children
of alumni and generous benefactors.

FRASIER:
Yes, yes.

Wait a minute.

15:26.527 --> 15:29.087
Oh, my God, we're such fools.
See what he was trying to tell us?

15:29.287 --> 15:31.755
He was trying to give us the way
to get Frederick accepted.

15:31.967 --> 15:35.801
Are you saying he was fishing
for a donation?

15:36.607 --> 15:41.158
So you think he was just trying to see
if we were willing to pay our fair share?

15:41.367 --> 15:42.880
What else?

15:43.247 --> 15:45.124
- Hi, Daddy.
- In a minute, Frederick.

15:45.327 --> 15:47.283
God, it was right in front of us,
and we missed it.

15:47.447 --> 15:50.678
- We didn't even see it.
- How could we be so blind?

15:50.887 --> 15:53.720
Maybe we should get ourselves back
there and give him what he wants.

15:53.887 --> 15:56.879
Right. We can't let anything stand
in the way of our son's welfare.

15:57.047 --> 15:58.878
- Mother.
- Mother has to run, munchkin.

a big hello hug,

16:17.127 --> 16:19.243
but as you can see,
I'm wearing this greasy apron.

16:19.447 --> 16:22.564
On top of which, I'm beginning
to loathe the sight of both of you.

16:22.767 --> 16:24.325
All the more reason for us to be brief.

16:24.487 --> 16:27.524

as soon as you've found the cufflink

No false pretence this time.

16:35.567 --> 16:39.958
We know that with so many qualified
applicants and only one position open

16:40.127 --> 16:42.595
that your decision
must be very difficult.

Yes. And so,
in the spirit of the holidays,

to your Pilgrims' table,

may flower.

I have never accepted a bribe.

that I find this utterly offensive...

...in every possible way.

Now, if you don't mind,
I have guests on the way

and a turkey so undercooked a skilled
veterinarian could still save him.

- Unless the rest of that sentence is:

in the breast pocket of that blazer,

- Well, I think "friends"

19:30.687 --> 19:33.440
is probably stretching it just a tad.

was a candidate for Marbury,

understand, as parents yourselves.
