You want to bet me at 20 yards?
I can do that.

I can do better than that.

So, guess what happens?

07:15.800 --> 07:16.687
No idea.

07:16.760 --> 07:18.046
Sergeant hits the roll switch

07:18.120 --> 07:20.282
and that target's now
flying back to 30 yards.

07:20.360 --> 07:21.850
Paper flying all over the place

07:21.960 --> 07:23.962
and he tells me
to hit a moving target.

07:24.040 --> 07:26.771
I mean, I can't even
see the head of this thing.

Whatever that is you're eating.

07:39.840 --> 07:42.650
Anyway, I close my eyes

16:41.840 --> 16:42.887
Who are you?

16:42.960 --> 16:44.689
I am Brisbane.

16:44.760 --> 16:47.206
The owner of the Nocturna.

16:47.280 --> 16:50.523
This is Dmitri
and the lady is Lydia.

16:52.960 --> 16:54.530
I shot a man in the face.

16:54.600 --> 16:55.647
Yes, you did.

16:56.800 --> 16:59.644
Mauricio Moldero,
head of the Moldero clan.

16:59.720 --> 17:02.530
We had to clean
his brains off the floor.

17:02.600 --> 17:05.843
I don't think he's going
to be very happy about that.

17:05.960 --> 17:09.328
He's not dead? That depends
on your definition of "dead."

17:10.960 --> 17:13.247
Where's the little girl
I came with?

17:13.319 --> 17:16.449
Yes, unfortunately,
you must forget about her.

17:16.520 --> 17:18.727
She's Moldero's property now.

17:18.800 --> 17:21.040
They're very deviant.

17:21.119 --> 17:23.726
Ever since their bloodline
became diseased

17:23.800 --> 17:26.201
we have distanced
ourselves from them.

17:27.760 --> 17:28.966
What are you people?

17:29.040 --> 17:31.805
We are very impressed with you.

17:31.880 --> 17:34.201
Not many can resist...

17:34.320 --> 17:36.129
[demonic voice] our voice.

17:37.920 --> 17:40.605
We have a proposition for you.

17:42.560 --> 17:45.803
If you work for us
during the day,

17:45.880 --> 17:47.928
we will protect you at night.

17:49.320 --> 17:50.765
[scoffs]

17:50.880 --> 17:53.087
I don't think he understands.

17:53.160 --> 17:54.605
Without our protection,

17:54.680 --> 17:57.206
you will not survive the night.

18:00.400 --> 18:01.765
(Brisbane) Roy Cody...

18:01.840 --> 18:04.207
us letting you leave
is not the same

18:04.280 --> 18:06.521
as us letting you go.

Get on your feet.
Come on. Come on.

18:56.640 --> 18:58.244
There you go.

19:15.880 --> 19:17.723
(Harry) Rise and shine.

19:17.840 --> 19:20.241
I told you you shouldn't have
walked that little girl home.

19:20.320 --> 19:22.721
It wasn't a home.

19:22.920 --> 19:24.046
It was a... Shh, shh. Uh-uh.

19:24.120 --> 19:26.248
You're doing that
talking thing again.

19:26.320 --> 19:28.561
But, Harry...
Just keep it to yourself.

19:28.640 --> 19:31.086
I don't want to hear
about it, okay?

19:31.160 --> 19:33.401
They're not human.

19:33.480 --> 19:34.811
They took that little girl.

19:34.880 --> 19:37.042
If you're smart,
you won't tell anybody

19:37.120 --> 19:39.407
about anything
you saw in there.

19:39.480 --> 19:41.960
I shot a man in the face

19:42.040 --> 19:43.485
and he didn't die.

19:47.480 --> 19:50.131
Well, maybe you didn't
shoot him hard enough.

My grandmother told me

27:32.160 --> 27:34.811
that whole place, bad juju.

27:34.920 --> 27:37.002
They raise the dead there.

After Katrina, you saw people
walking around after they was

I don't know nothing

27:46.680 --> 27:48.205
we don't go to that Parish.

27:48.280 --> 27:50.089
Bunch of blood-soaked

voodoo fanatics there.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.251
They're not fanatics,

27:53.320 --> 27:54.765

So, you know
what's going on there?

28:10.800 --> 28:13.280
We are paid
to look the other way.

what happened to her?

28:26.960 --> 28:28.371
She's dead.

Maybe we head south
of the border for a little while

28:38.000 --> 28:38.922

I am not your friend.

We're here for the job.

you could protect us.

looking for good men.

29:53.120 --> 29:55.361

looking for killers.

We just want to get
out of this mess alive.

of the Parish?

a common foe, Harry.

30:14.520 --> 30:16.761
We know who killed your wife.

30:20.760 --> 30:23.570
Obviously, we require
complete discretion

30:23.640 --> 30:27.008
or you and anyone you tell
will be killed.

30:27.080 --> 30:29.606
Who are these Molderos?

30:29.680 --> 30:31.762
A family that
are no longer related

30:31.840 --> 30:34.002

bad blood between us.

30:34.080 --> 30:36.731
How do we find
where they sleep?

If I had the answer
to that question,

I wouldn't need you, would I?

30:46.680 --> 30:48.569
Please ignore these blood cows.

If any of them try
to grab you, just kick it.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.241
My guests don't come
for the whiskey.

30:59.320 --> 31:01.561
So, the Molderos
keep children to bleed

31:01.640 --> 31:03.290

31:03.360 --> 31:07.046
These men are criminals.

a nurse during the war.

The Civil War.

the Molderos are sleeping.

32:17.880 --> 32:20.645
At night, this is
the only place where you can be.

32:20.720 --> 32:25.089
What's this bad blood
between you and the Molderos?

32:25.160 --> 32:27.891
You know that little girl
you brought in?

32:27.960 --> 32:28.961

32:29.040 --> 32:32.840
I used to be just like her.

32:32.920 --> 32:34.922

32:35.000 --> 32:38.243
A prisoner before
Brisbane saved me.

32:38.320 --> 32:40.368
Brisbane promised the Molderos

32:40.440 --> 32:42.568
would pay
for what they did to me.

You drive.

34:22.320 --> 34:24.721
Well, ma'am, he used to.

34:24.800 --> 34:27.087
That old Ford? Back in 1958.

34:27.159 --> 34:30.083
Last known registration
was Michael Wingate.

34:30.159 --> 34:31.321
And this was his address.

34:31.400 --> 34:32.561
Michael's in a wheelchair,

34:32.639 --> 34:33.880
he don't have nothing to say.

34:33.960 --> 34:36.531
Well, can we talk to him anyway?

34:36.600 --> 34:38.920
Can I see
your identification again?

34:46.280 --> 34:48.886
Well, here we are.

34:48.960 --> 34:51.167
He's been in a wheelchair
for 20 years,

34:51.239 --> 34:53.527
and he doesn't talk much.

34:53.600 --> 34:55.250
He doesn't eat much, either.

34:55.360 --> 34:57.727
You mind
leaving us alone a moment?

34:59.920 --> 35:01.285
Good luck.

35:03.480 --> 35:05.005
Mr. Wingate.

35:06.440 --> 35:08.886
We found your car.

35:09.880 --> 35:11.530
Old Ford from 1958?

35:13.400 --> 35:16.404
Thought maybe you could
tell us a bit about it.

35:17.400 --> 35:20.131
You ever heard
of the Moldero family?

35:22.880 --> 35:24.120
Let me help you.

35:32.680 --> 35:34.603
That was my car.

35:37.200 --> 35:40.921
Used to drive Lydia
around in that car.

35:44.720 --> 35:46.529
What she promise you, kid?

35:47.600 --> 35:49.443
Money?

35:49.520 --> 35:52.490
Immortality? [Scoffs]

35:52.560 --> 35:55.166
Want us to find where
the Molderos sleep.

35:57.480 --> 36:00.211
They asked me
to do the same thing.

36:01.000 --> 36:04.163
Back in 1975...

36:04.240 --> 36:05.446
but...

36:08.000 --> 36:10.207
Molderos found me first.

36:12.040 --> 36:15.169
Took turns cutting off my legs.

36:15.240 --> 36:17.971
Fed me on their blood.

36:18.040 --> 36:20.168
Keep me alive.

36:20.280 --> 36:22.044
[chuckles]

36:22.120 --> 36:24.930
That little Lydia. [Laughs]

36:25.000 --> 36:27.002
She's a crafty one.

36:28.600 --> 36:33.686
Which one of you two
she got her hooks into?

36:34.200 --> 36:36.726
She doesn't have
any hooks in us.

36:37.840 --> 36:41.890
You going to help us
find the Molderos or not?

36:41.960 --> 36:43.121
Come here.

36:44.440 --> 36:45.646
Come here.

36:50.400 --> 36:52.687
Back in the Civil War,

36:52.760 --> 36:54.728
Battle of Gettysburg,

36:54.800 --> 36:58.964
sweet Lydia used to creep out
[battlefield sounds]

36:59.040 --> 37:03.648
Into the fields
under the moonlight

37:03.720 --> 37:06.644
looking for the wounded

37:06.720 --> 37:09.644
wearing a nurse's uniform.

37:09.720 --> 37:11.643
[chuckles]

37:11.720 --> 37:14.166
Thousands of soldiers died.

37:14.240 --> 37:17.084
Thought they were
seeing a vision

37:17.160 --> 37:20.164
until she fed
on their blood till dawn.

37:20.240 --> 37:23.323
Don't trust any of them.

37:25.040 --> 37:26.451
Especially her.

37:27.800 --> 37:29.325
We don't have a choice.

37:31.240 --> 37:32.605
If...

37:34.680 --> 37:37.923
I help you find the Molderos,

37:38.000 --> 37:39.764
you got to do something for me.

37:42.120 --> 37:44.088
Under the bed.

37:44.160 --> 37:47.130
There's a suitcase.

37:47.240 --> 37:48.571
Take it.

37:53.040 --> 37:54.883
Promise me...

37:56.000 --> 38:00.961
you'll send those
bloodsucking bastards to hell.

38:03.360 --> 38:04.600
Well, that was interesting.

38:04.680 --> 38:06.011
Very interesting.

38:07.120 --> 38:10.408
Think Wingate just
gave us his rock collection.

38:10.480 --> 38:11.891
Give me the keys.

38:25.080 --> 38:26.366
Who's this guy?

38:27.640 --> 38:29.449
We're going to find out.

39:01.480 --> 39:03.209
[gunshot]

39:18.080 --> 39:20.367
(Harry) Lieutenant James Cort.

39:20.440 --> 39:24.570
Born January 28th, 1921.

39:24.640 --> 39:25.721
Who?

39:25.840 --> 39:28.320
Dead guy in the trunk
had a wallet and ID.

39:28.400 --> 39:29.970
Used to be a cop.

39:30.040 --> 39:33.203
Wingate was obsessed
with all of this.

39:33.880 --> 39:35.484
Seriously?

39:35.600 --> 39:37.090
Just took that dead guy's money?

39:37.160 --> 39:38.889
What's he going to do with it?

39:40.560 --> 39:43.723
These must be the kids
the Molderos keep for blood.

39:43.800 --> 39:45.484
Long dead by now.

39:45.560 --> 39:47.767
Well, there's
obviously plenty more.

39:47.840 --> 39:50.684
We need to save them and burn
the whole place to the ground.

39:50.760 --> 39:51.921
Burn them all to hell.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.128
These people,
whatever they are,

39:54.200 --> 39:56.123
they're demons. All of them.

39:56.200 --> 39:58.601
You need to calm the fuck down.

39:58.680 --> 40:00.284
They're using us.

40:00.360 --> 40:02.806
Just like Wingate
and that guy in the trunk.

40:02.920 --> 40:04.809
And look what happened to them.

40:04.920 --> 40:07.127
I won't help Brisbane.

40:07.200 --> 40:10.010
I won't be a part
of their revenge.

40:10.640 --> 40:12.290
I'm telling my uncle.

40:13.840 --> 40:16.889
You tell anyone
and we're both dead.

40:16.960 --> 40:18.121
We're dead anyways.

40:18.200 --> 40:19.884
The Molderos killed my wife.

40:19.960 --> 40:22.042
You got that?
You understand that?

40:22.120 --> 40:25.010
You want that to happen
to you and your family?

40:25.080 --> 40:27.162
Look, I want justice

40:27.240 --> 40:28.765
just as bad as you.

40:32.600 --> 40:34.568
I'll help you.

40:34.640 --> 40:35.801
But I won't help those demons

40:35.880 --> 40:39.930
and I sure as hell
won't go back as their house pet.

41:09.120 --> 41:10.770
[whispering]

41:18.320 --> 41:20.243
Mr. Ganet.

41:20.320 --> 41:22.322
Are you alone?

41:22.400 --> 41:23.731
Yeah.

41:23.800 --> 41:26.246
Oh. Well, please,
join our table.

41:27.320 --> 41:30.005
No. No, thanks.

41:30.080 --> 41:33.641
Brisbane would be
deeply offended.

41:33.760 --> 41:34.886
Harry, please,

41:34.960 --> 41:36.962
come have
a glass of wine with us.

41:40.040 --> 41:44.170
I'm more
of a whiskey man myself.

41:44.240 --> 41:47.926
It is a $10,000 bottle of wine.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.240
Please.

41:49.360 --> 41:51.044
Where's your partner?

41:51.120 --> 41:52.565
He's staying
somewhere he thought

41:52.640 --> 41:54.529
was safer tonight.

41:58.200 --> 42:00.885
Frank Wingate
shot himself today.

42:01.720 --> 42:03.404
I don't blame him.

42:03.480 --> 42:07.405
The bitter old man had been
in a wheelchair for over a decade.

42:07.480 --> 42:10.051
He said the Molderos
ate his legs.

42:10.120 --> 42:11.849
Yes.

42:11.920 --> 42:13.126
They did.

42:13.200 --> 42:14.690
They're sick.

42:14.800 --> 42:17.167
They are not like us.

42:21.120 --> 42:23.407
Wh... Why do they
feed on children?

42:23.480 --> 42:25.926
The adult blood
makes them sick.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.128
(Lydia)
They keep dozens of children

42:28.200 --> 42:30.965
and bleed them slowly.

42:31.040 --> 42:34.408
Their favorites like Katherine,
are kept alive for years.

42:34.480 --> 42:36.926
And with your help,
Harry, we will wipe them

42:37.000 --> 42:39.446
from the face of the Earth.

42:39.520 --> 42:40.851
[coughs]

42:42.200 --> 42:45.647
Boy, this wine
sure packs a kick.

42:47.160 --> 42:48.844
Are you all right?

42:48.960 --> 42:50.121
Yeah.

42:50.960 --> 42:52.849
Yeah, I...

42:52.920 --> 42:56.447
I think I'm going
to head up to my room.

42:56.520 --> 42:58.090
[clears throat]

43:16.400 --> 43:18.767
[growling]

43:37.080 --> 43:38.684
[groans]

43:41.920 --> 43:44.127
I should stick to whiskey.

43:45.120 --> 43:47.851
Drink had nothing
to do with it.

43:47.920 --> 43:49.809
I mixed my blood in your wine.

43:49.880 --> 43:52.565
To see the side effects.

43:52.640 --> 43:53.801
Why?

43:53.880 --> 43:56.042
Some people
overdose on our blood.

43:56.120 --> 43:58.043
Others have temporary benefits.

43:59.160 --> 44:00.685
What were you hoping for?

44:00.760 --> 44:03.001
I was hoping for benefits.

44:03.080 --> 44:04.525
Look at your wound.

44:18.000 --> 44:22.130
And, by the way, there are
no candles in this room.

44:23.480 --> 44:25.528
You're seeing in the dark.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.002
So, where's your partner?

44:34.960 --> 44:36.849
Safest place I know.

44:54.280 --> 44:56.408
Please come with me, hon.

44:56.480 --> 44:58.403
Harry said I'd be safe here.

45:07.480 --> 45:09.289
Here. It's on the house.

45:10.160 --> 45:11.047
What is it?

45:11.120 --> 45:13.122
It's scotch.

45:13.200 --> 45:15.521
We're all out
of chocolate milk.

45:19.360 --> 45:20.486
[coughs]

45:20.560 --> 45:21.766
[giggles]

45:28.800 --> 45:31.451
You'll wake me up
if I fall asleep, right?

45:31.520 --> 45:35.525
Hey, for $100 I'll keep
you up all night long.

45:35.600 --> 45:37.648
I'm good. Thanks.

45:50.600 --> 45:52.682
<i>(Katherine)
Promise me something.</i>

45:52.760 --> 45:54.728
<i>You won't let them hurt me.</i>

45:55.080 --> 45:56.491
<i>(Dmitri) These "men."</i>

45:56.560 --> 46:00.406
<i>Rapist, murderer, pedophile.</i>

46:03.920 --> 46:05.001
I used to be...

46:05.080 --> 46:07.003
<i>[echoing "I used to be..."]</i>

46:07.080 --> 46:08.684
Detective.

46:08.760 --> 46:09.966
[snarling]

46:32.360 --> 46:33.805
You were supposed
to keep me up.

46:33.880 --> 46:36.087
I didn't know you were asleep.

47:32.200 --> 47:33.611
[cell phone rings]

47:36.640 --> 47:38.847
Yeah, anything on our dead guy?

47:38.920 --> 47:42.322
<i>(Roy) Yeah, he still makes
a lot of phone calls.</i>

47:42.400 --> 47:43.686
Run that by me again?

47:43.760 --> 47:45.569
There's a James Cort
in the Parish District

47:45.640 --> 47:46.880
with an active cell phone.

47:46.960 --> 47:50.089
Same social security number
as the stiff in the trunk.

47:50.200 --> 47:51.281
You got an address?

47:51.360 --> 47:53.647
<i>Yeah, that old factory
out past 10.</i>

47:53.720 --> 47:56.564
Harry, it's going
to be dark soon.

47:56.640 --> 47:58.210
<i>(Harry) Drive fast.</i>

48:19.400 --> 48:21.004
What's the plan?

48:21.080 --> 48:23.481
Plan was for you to be
here half an hour ago.

48:51.600 --> 48:52.647
[Man] Whoa.

48:52.720 --> 48:54.563
You ain't got no business here.

48:55.280 --> 48:56.884
You James Cort?

48:56.960 --> 48:57.643
Who?

48:57.720 --> 48:59.324
Somebody used
the social of a dead guy

48:59.400 --> 49:01.209
to get a cell phone.

49:01.280 --> 49:02.441
Was that you?

49:04.640 --> 49:06.130
Let's find out.

49:11.160 --> 49:12.605
[cell phone rings]

49:13.040 --> 49:15.441
Why don't you get
the fuck off my property?

49:40.800 --> 49:42.404
<i>[whooshing]</i>

49:54.640 --> 49:56.324
[whispering]
How do we open this?

49:56.400 --> 49:58.084
She has a key.

50:41.720 --> 50:43.051
<i>[heart beating]</i>

51:14.840 --> 51:15.966
[gasps]

51:16.040 --> 51:17.530
[grunts]

51:20.720 --> 51:21.926
Ah, fuck.

51:23.320 --> 51:25.322
Come on. Let's go.

51:25.400 --> 51:27.209
It's all right. It's all right.

51:29.240 --> 51:30.651
[grunts]

51:36.520 --> 51:38.409
Come on, come on, come on.
Go, go, go.

51:39.920 --> 51:41.126
[roars]

51:41.240 --> 51:42.480
Whoa.

51:45.120 --> 51:45.962
[screams]

51:46.080 --> 51:47.605
<i>Go, go, go! [Roaring]</i>

51:49.120 --> 51:50.360
Go, go.

51:50.440 --> 51:51.566
GO, go! go...

52:14.720 --> 52:16.563
These kids lost a lot of blood.

52:22.680 --> 52:24.728
Mr. Ganet,
where's your partner?

52:24.800 --> 52:27.644
I told you,
he doesn't like it here.

52:27.760 --> 52:29.444
It's not safe anywhere else.

52:29.520 --> 52:32.364
Yeah, well,
that's up for debate.

52:43.480 --> 52:45.209
[Cries]

52:47.720 --> 52:49.245
Find who did this.

53:04.840 --> 53:07.320
What do you think you're doing?

53:07.400 --> 53:09.562
I'm bleeding.
What does it look like?

53:09.640 --> 53:11.608
Brisbane wants
to hear of your progress.

53:11.680 --> 53:13.284
I'm supposed
to clean you up for dinner.

53:13.360 --> 53:14.521
No more blood wine, thanks.

53:14.600 --> 53:16.489
He's the only reason
you're still alive.

53:16.560 --> 53:18.927
Maybe you could
show some respect.

53:22.520 --> 53:25.444
(Dmitri) Hopefully, I haven't
lost my touch for cooking.

53:25.520 --> 53:29.127
(Harry)
Yeah. I thi... I think I'm good.

53:30.320 --> 53:31.810
So, Harry.

53:31.960 --> 53:34.247
What is it that
you have found out?

53:34.320 --> 53:36.209
We found the Moldero woman

53:36.280 --> 53:38.886
and her secret collection
of stolen kids.

53:38.960 --> 53:40.485
So...

53:40.560 --> 53:42.767
guess it's one down.

53:42.840 --> 53:46.526
What do you mean "one down?"

53:46.600 --> 53:50.002
Well, she burned to death
in her house.

53:51.520 --> 53:53.249
Sort of an accident.

53:53.320 --> 53:55.607
Please tell us that you're kidding.

53:55.680 --> 53:58.331
You told us to get rid
of them, right?

53:58.400 --> 53:59.970
Like father, like son.

54:00.040 --> 54:01.530
You arrogant bastard.

54:01.600 --> 54:04.524
The Moldero's reach
goes beyond this city.

54:04.600 --> 54:07.365
Beyond your
limited comprehension.

54:07.440 --> 54:10.444
You were supposed to find out
where they were sleeping.

54:10.520 --> 54:11.931
And inform us.

54:12.000 --> 54:13.684
Not burn their Queen.

54:13.760 --> 54:15.762
Well, I won't kill
any of them next time.

54:15.840 --> 54:18.320
Harry. Brisbane, don't.

54:18.440 --> 54:21.603
There won't be a next time.

54:34.400 --> 54:36.289
This act could have brought

54:36.360 --> 54:38.567
the entire
Moldero clan upon us.

54:38.640 --> 54:41.291
This could start an open war.

54:41.360 --> 54:47.083
The Moldero's must be killed all
at once, not one by one, Harry.

54:47.160 --> 54:50.164
We've had an unfortunate death
in our family.

54:56.040 --> 54:58.202
We believe...

54:58.280 --> 55:01.090
this man was responsible
for the attack.

55:01.160 --> 55:03.242
This man sleeps here
the entire day.

55:03.360 --> 55:05.442
I doubt that he is responsible.

55:05.520 --> 55:07.284
[chuckles]

55:08.320 --> 55:10.322
You keep him around
for amusement?

55:10.400 --> 55:12.323
[laughs]

55:12.400 --> 55:13.811
Yes.

55:13.880 --> 55:16.611
Then you're not protecting him.

55:18.240 --> 55:19.321
No.

55:19.400 --> 55:20.925
Glad to hear it.

55:24.160 --> 55:25.491
Did you set her on fire?

55:26.800 --> 55:28.290
Huh?

55:28.360 --> 55:29.361
No.

55:29.440 --> 55:31.329
Where's your partner?

55:31.400 --> 55:33.004
Where is he?

55:33.080 --> 55:35.003
The man obviously doesn't know.

55:40.800 --> 55:42.165
I believe you.

55:43.080 --> 55:44.684
Remember Katherine?

55:45.800 --> 55:48.963
We'll be making her one of us.

55:49.040 --> 55:50.246
On...

55:50.320 --> 55:51.685
her...

55:51.760 --> 55:53.171
birth.

55:53.240 --> 55:55.208
[grunts]

55:59.080 --> 56:01.765
Lydia, you are
a fool for speaking.

56:01.840 --> 56:04.320
He could've
recognized your voice.

56:04.400 --> 56:06.050
Then I'm a fool.

56:13.360 --> 56:15.089
He is so pathetic.

56:16.440 --> 56:18.568
Get him out of here.

56:18.640 --> 56:21.928
He's already done
enough damage.

56:35.200 --> 56:36.804
Give me your blood.

56:37.960 --> 56:40.201
You would need too much.
We would both die.

56:40.280 --> 56:42.521
You want revenge, don't you?

57:06.680 --> 57:07.886
Enough.

57:15.520 --> 57:16.851
Stop.

57:18.040 --> 57:19.644
[grunts]

57:21.680 --> 57:23.967
You have too much of me.

57:24.040 --> 57:25.963
Now we'll both die.

57:27.120 --> 57:28.406
No.

57:29.320 --> 57:30.651
We won't.

57:45.320 --> 57:46.651
Come on.

57:46.720 --> 57:48.131
It's all right, come on.

59:33.400 --> 59:35.562
Don't let her suffer anymore.

59:35.640 --> 59:37.563
It's time to say goodbye.

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:17.366
I need your blood, darling. No.

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:20.250
The child needs to be alive
for her birthday party.

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:23.642
Belinda wants the child
to be made, not killed.

01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:26.485
Who did this to our Queen?

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:28.602
The detective
denies everything.

01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:30.489
But Lydia may know.

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:31.891
Lydia.

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:37.120
That woman's just a showpiece.

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:40.363
I have not in a hundred
years heard her speak.

01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:42.442
She did today.

01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:44.329
And it was a voice
that we know.

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:47.130
I think she was one of ours

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:49.123
who escaped long ago.

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:53.282
One of ours?

01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:55.761
I never forget a voice.

01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:57.723
And if she was one of ours,

01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:03.006
then by rights, Brisbane
must give her back to us.

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:06.163
Which, of course,
he will never do.

01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:13.527
It's a perfect excuse
for a war.

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:20.362
So Lydia has
our mark on her hand.

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:23.810
We should demand her back...

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:26.884
or war it is.

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:30.449
War it is.

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:39.284
(Lydia) Soon you'll be
stronger than most men.

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:41.931
You'll heal quicker,
move faster.

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:46.561
You might even have
a voice of your own.

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:49.682
For how long?

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:51.649
The effects
will last a few days.

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:55.090
Long enough for you
to get as far away

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:56.924
as you can from the city.

01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:01.086
Where am I going?

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:11.927
Brisbane made me.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.128
His blood is my blood.

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:15.770
I have to stay with him.

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:06.322
It's quite the evening
for mistakes, isn't it?

01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:09.962
You could be more specific.

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:14.849
I could feel
the man's heartbeat.

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:17.806
Yes, he's alive.

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:20.201
I gave him my blood.

01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:22.282
Your blood?

01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:24.203
Is it your blood
to give, Lydia?

01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:26.971
I wanted the Molderos dead.

01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:31.529
At least he has the courage
to do what needs to be done.

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:37.609
Did you make him?

01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:41.687
What do you care?

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:43.569
You never loved me.

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:46.402
You felt pity for me.

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:52.006
Pity is not the word
that I would use.

01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:57.406
Carlo recognized your voice.

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:02.002
They know that I took you.

01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:07.087
It was either
giving you back...

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:09.288
or start open war.

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:31.247
Welcome to hell, little man.

01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:49.525
<i>(Harry)
Yeah, I told someone, once.</i>

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:51.125
<i>Told my wife.</i>

01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:53.447
<i>You know what happened to her?</i>

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:55.602
<i>She's dead.</i>

01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:57.284
<i>[whispering]</i>

01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:11.843
[phone vibrates]

01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:26.685
<i>[chains clanking]</i>

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:38.241
<i>Hey. Hey'-!</i>

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:43.164
Hi. How you feeling?

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:44.730
Want to make a phone call?

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:47.565
I got my phone still.
Want to make a phone call?

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:48.801
Want to make a phone call?

01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:55.441
I'm going to unlock
some of these coffins.

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:01.010
You know where you are?

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:04.322
This is... this is
the starving room.

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:05.890
That's what they call it.

01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:09.043
It's where the Molderos
bring their enemies

01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:13.569
if they really, really,
really want them to suffer.

01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:16.530
What they do is they make them
one of their kind.

01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:20.329
And lock them down here.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.650
And they...

01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:24.806
they starve them.

01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:27.762
Some of them,
they get very hungry.

01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:30.446
Then they bang,
and they bang, and they bang.

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:31.931
[bangs on coffin]

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.081
Every once in a while,

01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:35.845
the boss will just
throw them a little morsel.

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:39.083
Kind of like you. [Chuckles]

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:43.404
And then that keeps them
strong enough...

01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:48.281
to bang because he just
likes it when they bang.

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:53.006
Aren't you scared?

01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:56.287
Well, they only
come out at night.

01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:58.522
<i>[chains clanking]</i>

01:06:58.600 --> 01:06:59.931
And then they just crawl out.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:03.766
They'll see you.
Tear you to pieces.

01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:05.888
There's a lot of competition.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.650
It's a...

01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:09.609
it's a big mess.

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:13.325
So, that's the starving room,

01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:14.686
and have a good time.

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:16.886
Untie me.

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:24.044
<i>[demonic voice] Untie me.</i>

01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:25.451
<i>[echoes "untie me"]</i>

01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:28.246
Okay.

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:39.841
[grunts]

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:42.651
Shh. Shh.

01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:44.210
Now, calm down.

01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:45.520
[grunts]

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:48.444
Now, tell me where Lydia
and the little girl are.

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:53.085
She's getting ready
to take a sunbath.

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:00.846
Hey.

01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:03.048
You want some suntan lotion?

01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:06.051
Just get in.

01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:08.001
[grunts]

01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:13.244
You fucking pig!

01:08:16.359 --> 01:08:18.567
[moaning]

01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:22.649
Hey, you can't
just leave me here!

01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:43.121
Come on.

01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:44.531
We got to be quick.

01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:45.801
Here, give me your hand.

01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:47.086
Lift this up.

01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:51.729
Bring him to me.

01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:10.365
Come on, come on.

01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:12.086
Where's Katherine?

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:13.491
I don't know.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.729
<i>[heart beating]</i>

01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:19.769
Come on. Easy.

01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:22.969
We'll stay here tonight
until you heal.

01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:25.166
Here.

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:30.410
When you get better,
we'll leave.

01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:32.765
Harry?

01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:36.122
I've lost too much blood.

01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:38.331
We could both die.

01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:40.890
What are you talking about?

01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:44.487
Unless I feed, I have
no blood to give you.

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:49.570
[phone rings]

01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:53.889
Yeah? <i>[Woman] Hey,
it's the from' desk</i>

01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:56.611
<i>and there's someone here
who wants to see you.</i>

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:01.606
Okay.

01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:06.008
I'll be right back.

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:07.241
Okay.

01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:25.642
I promised Lydia
I wouldn't harm you.

01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:27.609
How did you find me?

01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:30.968
I always know
where my blood is.

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:34.010
So, you're on your honeymoon
with your new bride.

01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:38.369
Honestly, how long
do you think it will last?

01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:39.805
We'll be just fine.

01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:42.645
Lydia doesn't
have her own voice.

01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:45.644
She can't control
others like I can.

01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:49.042
When you're on the hunt,
you need to control people.

01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:51.361
It gets very messy.

01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:53.886
Very dangerous, Harry.

01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:00.724
Can you provide for her, Harry?

01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:02.245
Can you help her?

01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:05.204
Can you help her kill?

01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:10.009
You're free, Harry. Free to go.

01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:12.961
Start a new life for yourself.

01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:16.010
I know how
to take care of Lydia.

01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:21.200
Lydia doesn't want you anymore.

01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:25.130
Then run.

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:28.841
Run, run, run.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.890
The Molderos are having
a celebration tonight.

01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:39.811
They are going to turn that little
girl that you brought them,

01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:42.770
and then they are
going to use her...

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:46.290
to hunt you down.

<i>[Man] Don't say a word.</i>

01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:40.200
Who the hell are you?

01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:42.328
Room service?

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:44.727
You got a problem?

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:47.963
[Woman]
You sadistic piece of shit.

01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:51.645
No, man.

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:55.167
Just sounds like y'all are
having a party in here.

01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:57.402
What's it to you?

01:14:57.480 --> 01:14:59.164
Well...

01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:03.882
My girl and I are staying
next door and...

01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:06.804
she's pretty wild.
She likes it rough.

01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:09.201
Maybe y'all can come
over and party with us.

01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:11.121
Oh, yeah?

01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:14.521
Yeah.

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:16.284
<i>(Brisbane) Start a new life.</i>

01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:19.728
Honey? I'm back.

01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:22.491
Brought a friend.

01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:27.851
Damn, sure is
a fine looking lady.

01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:29.246
Yep.

01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:33.330
So you like it rough, huh?

01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:41.080
(Lydia) Now I understand.

01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:43.128
You two enjoy yourselves.

01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:48.245
You like it rough?

01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:50.004
You're going to get it rough.

01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:54.929
<i>[ripping] [man screams]</i>

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:37.686
How long will your blood
stay in me?

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:40.127
A few days.

01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:42.242
Then you'll go into withdrawl.

01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:45.210
First shakes,
then blindness, then death.

01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:50.368
So I guess
we need each other now.

01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:53.163
So let's go away.

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:56.727
Let's go somewhere
far away from here.

01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:00.011
We've got some business
to take care of first.

01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:03.521
We got to take out
those Molderos.

01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:05.329
We can't do that alone.

01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:07.884
We're not going to be alone.

01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:11.966
I got the key
to their starving room.

01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:14.490
We're going to let out some

01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:18.884
very angry, very hungry
victims of theirs.

01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:26.361
It's better
than running forever.

01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:02.645
[cell phone rings]

01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:10.122
Hello?

01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:13.522
Hey, partner. I could use
some help from above.

01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:15.125
<i>(Roy) Where are you?</i>

01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:16.531
Meet me at Louie's.

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:39.891
So you belong to her now?

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:41.121
Bring the stuff?

01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:46.960
You know, I never stole
anything before in my life.

01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:50.169
You said you wanted to burn
the Molderos to the ground, right?

01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:52.163
That's why I'm here.

01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:54.891
You coming with us?

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:56.684
Yeah. Grab that.

01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:18.531
<i>Hmm.</i>

01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:21.089
Oh, my darling.

01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:23.644
My beautiful little doll.

01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:28.089
You're going to be so perfect.

01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:32.889
Are all these presents for me?

01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:36.169
Yes, they're all for you.

01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:38.689
But it's not my birthday.

01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:41.085
But it will be.

01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:51.050
We need some backup.

01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:52.007
<i>[Man] Yes, sir.</i>

01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:54.208
<i>SWAT team is on the way.</i>

01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:02.402
Remember to make a wish.

01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:10.684
You haven't forgot
about me, have you?

01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:11.682
No.

01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:14.047
I also brought you a gift.

01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:19.289
After she makes you...

01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:23.282
you'll be living
in a box for a few years,

01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:25.362
until you learn respect.

01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:49.600
<i>[gunshot]</i>

01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:11.601
Shh. Be quiet, little one.

<i>[heart beating]</i>

01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:05.608
All right, stay down.

01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:19.731
"GO, go! go"

01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:25.684
<i>[wood splintering]</i>

01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:38.485
It's all right, let's go.

01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:42.647
Come on. Come on out.
We're not alone.

01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:43.960
No!

01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:45.246
[gun clicks]

01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:47.004
[laughing]

01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:53.324
Hello, Lydia.

01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:55.528
My, how you've grown.

01:22:56.720 --> 01:22:58.688
Take Katherine. Now.

01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:01.730
I'm not leaving you here alone.
Go!

01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:05.166
I'll be back.

01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:16.168
Did you miss Mommy?

01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:42.164
I can't see anything.

01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:44.208
Stay close.

What's the matter?

Seeing in the dark now, are we?

01:23:57.200 --> 01:24:00.010
Run. Now.
As fast as you can. Go.

01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:06.761
Lydia gave you
Brisbane's blood.

01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:08.365
Made you a little hero
for a night.

01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:16.887
Let's see how long you last.

01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:38.401
[laughs]

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:41.562
It's not the blood, little man.

01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:42.971
It's experience.

01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:14.281
You used to be
such a sweet little girl.

01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:16.848
I'm not a little girl anymore.

[demonic voice] Open the door.

your voice on me?

01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:04.804
No.

On them.

Don't move. [Rumbling]

Walk towards me.
Don't look at them.

01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:43.209
Roy, get them out of here.

01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:45.960
Take care of Lydia.

Okay?
