Today is a tragic day
for Canada.

00:43.293 --> 00:45.128
Thousands of Canadians
have gathered to mourn

00:45.128 --> 00:48.798
the passing
of their beloved mother.

00:48.798 --> 00:52.010
The Queen is dead.

<i>Oh, God, she's dead ♪</i>

01:02.187 --> 01:03.980
And now the casket
is brought down the aisle

01:03.980 --> 01:05.940
with the Queen inside.

01:05.940 --> 01:08.109
The Queen's body being carried
by the royal guard.

01:08.109 --> 01:10.445
<i>What a horrible day for Canada
and therefore the world.</i>

01:10.445 --> 01:14.324
<i>Not the Queen ♪</i>

01:14.324 --> 01:17.660
<i>She is dead ♪</i>

01:17.660 --> 01:20.163
Ike, the Queen died
like four months ago.

01:20.163 --> 01:24.918
You gotta let it go.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.920
And here comes
Canada's most beloved musician,

01:26.920 --> 01:28.546
Sir Smelly John.

01:28.546 --> 01:30.089
Yes, Smelly John
is sitting down at the piano

01:30.089 --> 01:32.133
with a tribute
for the Queen, I believe.

playing "Darktide" right now.

01:45.021 --> 01:48.191
Get off!
Fuck you, Kyle!

01:48.191 --> 01:50.193
Oh, and now people
are starting to stare angrily.

01:50.193 --> 01:51.945
Y-Yes, it looks like
the Prince and his new wife

01:51.945 --> 01:53.279
have just shown up.

01:53.279 --> 01:54.405
The Prince and his wife
have, of course,

01:54.405 --> 01:56.074
been bashing
the Canadian monarchy.

01:56.074 --> 01:59.035
A lot of Canadians
hate them now.

01:59.035 --> 02:00.370
Oh, and I belive
the Earl of Halifax

02:00.370 --> 02:02.080
has just farted
on the Prince's wife's face!

02:02.080 --> 02:03.957
The Prince seems to have
taken offense to this.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.458
Oh, this is bad now.

02:05.458 --> 02:07.210
Ike, I'm playing "Darktide"
with my friends.

02:07.210 --> 02:10.380
No, get off me!

02:14.884 --> 02:16.135
Hey, guys.

02:16.135 --> 02:17.846
Kyle, dude,
where were you last night?

02:17.846 --> 02:19.639
Yeah,
we were all waiting.

02:19.639 --> 02:21.140
I haven't been
showing up for things, but--

02:21.140 --> 02:22.892
but I got screwed
by my little brother.

02:22.892 --> 02:24.435
He just keeps crying
about the Queen.

02:24.435 --> 02:26.062
And then there's
this Prince and his wife

02:26.062 --> 02:27.647
and they're bashing
the Canadian monarchy.

02:27.647 --> 02:28.940
I guess it's like people
don't even know

02:28.940 --> 02:30.817
why they showed up
to the funeral

02:30.817 --> 02:32.986
But, anyway, I'm really sorry
I ruined game time for everyone.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.779
You didn't ruin it for anyone.
We played without you.

02:34.779 --> 02:38.074
What? Y-You guys, we-- we said
we'd all level up together.

02:38.074 --> 02:39.909
Well, yeah, we're
all like level 12 now.

02:39.909 --> 02:41.161
We got some sweet drip, dude.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.495
Mrph rmhmhm rm!

02:42.495 --> 02:45.039
But this isn't fair,
it wasn't my fault.

02:45.039 --> 02:47.000
Hey, guys. Did you get
to upgrade your rifle, Stan?

02:47.000 --> 02:48.501
Yeah, it's got
a lot better range now.

02:48.501 --> 02:49.752
What about you?

02:49.752 --> 02:51.296
I kept the same gun,
but I got some sweet drip.

02:51.296 --> 02:54.048
Nice, sweet drip, dude.

02:58.136 --> 02:59.929
It stinks,
doesn't it?

02:59.929 --> 03:01.514
What stinks?

03:01.514 --> 03:03.349
When people make certain
judgements about you.

03:03.349 --> 03:05.226
I've been watching you, Kyle,

03:05.226 --> 03:08.062
and I can see you're having
some problems with your brand.

03:08.062 --> 03:09.772
My brand?

03:13.484 --> 03:15.361
Some kids call it
your credibility

03:15.361 --> 03:16.905
or your reputation,

03:16.905 --> 03:18.239
but those things
are just little parts

03:18.239 --> 03:19.866
of something
much more important--

03:19.866 --> 03:21.200
your brand.

03:21.200 --> 03:23.077
Think about it, Kyle.

03:23.077 --> 03:25.955
Who are you?

03:25.955 --> 03:28.458
I'm just--
I-I'm just me.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.501
See? You don't know
what your brand is.

03:30.501 --> 03:32.462
So how is anyone else
supposed to know?

03:32.462 --> 03:34.130
It's like a commercial
for Kyle,

03:34.130 --> 03:36.799
but you're not putting
a label on the jar.

03:36.799 --> 03:38.927
Butters, this seems
very out of character for you.

03:38.927 --> 03:41.304
That's because
I've been workin' on my brand.

03:41.304 --> 03:43.348
My parents saw that my brand
wasn't working with people

03:43.348 --> 03:46.267
so they sent me
to brand management.

03:46.267 --> 03:48.394
Brand management?

04:05.370 --> 04:06.955
Hi, Mr. Davis.

04:06.955 --> 04:09.415
Well, Butters Stotch.
How you doing there, Butters?

04:09.415 --> 04:11.000
How's the brand going?

04:11.000 --> 04:12.794
I made two new friends,
and a girl asked me

04:12.794 --> 04:14.003
to help her
with her homework.

04:14.003 --> 04:16.089
Well, there ya go there, Butters.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.341
My friend Kyle here was thinking
of reworking his brand a bit,

04:18.341 --> 04:20.009
and I told him
maybe you could help.

04:20.009 --> 04:21.636
Oh, well,
sure there, Kyle,

04:21.636 --> 04:23.846
let's just get you to fill out
a CumHammer survey,

04:23.846 --> 04:25.264
and then we'll go
in the back

04:25.264 --> 04:27.684
and come up
with some options for ya.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.271
it's "Good Morning, Canada."

04:34.232 --> 04:35.817
It has been
several months now

04:35.817 --> 04:37.735
since our beloved Queen
has died.

04:37.735 --> 04:39.737
All Canadians are finding
it hard to go on.

04:39.737 --> 04:42.281
All Canadians, that is,
except for our first guests,

04:42.281 --> 04:43.700
The Prince and his wife.

04:45.493 --> 04:48.871
We want privacy!
We want privacy!

04:50.164 --> 04:51.791
Thanks for having us
on the show.

04:51.791 --> 04:54.836
It's so awesome to be here.
It's great.

04:54.836 --> 04:56.421
So let me start with you, sir.

04:56.421 --> 04:57.672
You lived a life
with the royal family,

04:57.672 --> 04:59.048
you had everything
handed to you

04:59.048 --> 05:00.842
but you say your life
has been hard,

05:00.842 --> 05:03.553
and you've written all aboot
it in your new book, "Waaagh."

05:03.553 --> 05:05.263
Yes that's right, fwiend.

05:05.263 --> 05:06.723
You see,
my wife and I are--

05:06.723 --> 05:07.849
I was totally like,
"You should write a book

05:07.849 --> 05:09.058
'cause you're family's,
like, stupid,

05:09.058 --> 05:11.394
and then so are, like,
journalists."

05:11.394 --> 05:12.770
So you hate
journalists?

05:12.770 --> 05:14.397
That's right.

05:14.397 --> 05:16.149
that reports on the lives
of the royal family.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.316
Right.

05:17.316 --> 05:19.360
So you're a journalist.

05:19.360 --> 05:20.403
We just want
to be normal people.

05:20.403 --> 05:22.572
All this attention
is so hard.

05:22.572 --> 05:24.615
Isn't it true, sir,
that your questionable wife

05:24.615 --> 05:26.534
has her own TV show
and hangs out with celebrities

05:26.534 --> 05:28.036
and does fashion magazines?

05:28.036 --> 05:29.537
What are you suggesting?

05:29.537 --> 05:31.372
Well, I just think some
people might say

05:31.372 --> 05:33.041
that your Instagram-loving
bitch wife

05:33.041 --> 05:34.542
actually <i>doesn't</i>
want her privacy.

05:34.542 --> 05:36.377
How dare you, sir!

05:36.377 --> 05:39.422
My Instagram-loving bitch wife
has always wanted her privacy!

05:39.422 --> 05:41.799
And you know what else?
To hell with Canada.

05:41.799 --> 05:43.342
We are leaving.

05:43.342 --> 05:44.927
We'll go find
some quiet place

05:44.927 --> 05:46.554
where we can be
normal people.

05:46.554 --> 05:49.098
Come on, wife.

Alright there, Kyle,
we got your survey answers,

06:59.335 --> 07:03.631
and I think we've put together
some great ideas for your brand.

07:03.631 --> 07:06.342
I understand you want people
to like you more

07:06.342 --> 07:08.094
and think you're cool.

07:08.094 --> 07:09.762
Is that right?

07:09.762 --> 07:12.181
Alright, well, let's see
how this brand works for you.

07:12.181 --> 07:17.103
We got... Kyle-- Rugged. Vegan.
Compassionate. Victim.

07:19.814 --> 07:21.732
I-- I don't think
that's really me.

07:21.732 --> 07:23.317
Well, that's fine 'cause
there's a lot of different

07:23.317 --> 07:26.195
brands people are attracted to.
How about this one?

07:26.195 --> 07:29.866
Kyle-- Sensitive. Outdoorsy.
Frugal. Victim.

07:31.492 --> 07:33.578
I'm not--
I'm not that outdoorsy.

07:33.578 --> 07:35.163
Okay, well,
remember there, Kyle,

07:35.163 --> 07:37.957
it's not so much about
who you <i>are</i> as much as it is

07:37.957 --> 07:40.084
about what people
are attracted to, okay?

07:40.084 --> 07:41.419
So let's see, how about this?

07:43.337 --> 07:44.714
Kyle-- Wealthy. Handsome.

07:44.714 --> 07:47.758
Multi-talented
Grammy Award-Winning. Victim.

07:47.758 --> 07:49.302
Oh, that-- that one's
taken already.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.928
Sorry. Hold on.

07:50.928 --> 07:52.221
Just a minute, Kyle.

07:52.221 --> 07:53.681
We're gonna find
a good one here for you.

07:53.681 --> 07:54.891
You'll see, Kyle.

07:54.891 --> 07:56.684
When you have your brand up
and runnin,'

07:56.684 --> 07:58.352
no one can stop you.

08:02.273 --> 08:05.276
Look at this town.
There's just something about it.

08:06.444 --> 08:08.905
Oh, darling.
I think this might be the place.

08:08.905 --> 08:11.657
You really think so?

08:11.657 --> 08:13.409
It's so quiet
and empty here.

08:13.409 --> 08:15.870
If we moved here,
then people would think

08:15.870 --> 08:18.414
we're really serious
about wanting to be normal.

08:18.414 --> 08:21.250
It does seem perfect,
doesn't it?

08:21.250 --> 08:23.294
We can have
a fresh start here.

08:23.294 --> 08:25.338
Lead a normal life
and have babies.

08:25.338 --> 08:29.050
Can we? Can we really move here
and finally have our privacy?

08:29.050 --> 08:33.095
My love, I will do anything
for your privacy.

08:53.699 --> 08:55.451
The couch goes
in the first room!

08:55.451 --> 08:57.620
Ay, be careful
with that TV, buddy!

08:57.620 --> 08:59.747
Drum set goes
on the second floor.

08:59.747 --> 09:01.040
Wait. Put it down.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.833
I want to make sure
it isn't damaged.

09:04.043 --> 09:05.419
What the hell?

09:09.799 --> 09:11.759
Hey!
Hey, you!

09:11.759 --> 09:13.970
Hey,
what are you looking at?!

09:13.970 --> 09:16.597
You ever heard
of privacy?!

09:16.597 --> 09:17.848
What?

09:21.978 --> 09:24.772
You guys,
I am so sorry.

09:24.772 --> 09:26.691
I totally was going to play
with you guys online

09:26.691 --> 09:28.276
but the Prince of Canada
and his wife

09:28.276 --> 09:31.153
moved in across
the street from me.

09:31.153 --> 09:33.030
They have this huge jet
parked in front of my house

09:33.030 --> 09:35.241
and then they kept trying to
get me to buy their stupid book

09:35.241 --> 09:38.077
and-- and, anyway, I'm sorry
I messed up another game night.

09:38.077 --> 09:39.870
It's okay, dude,
we had a great time.

09:39.870 --> 09:42.331
Yeah, we are literally
dripping with drip.

09:42.331 --> 09:44.083
Well, I just want
you guys to know

09:44.083 --> 09:48.129
that I am a reliable,
fun-loving, punctual victim.

09:48.129 --> 09:50.131
'Kay, well,
we gotta get to class.

09:53.884 --> 09:56.137
I'm really working
on myself!

09:56.137 --> 09:58.055
You're gonna like
what you see!

10:03.811 --> 10:07.148
CumHammer Head Guy:
As a child, you see the world
in a different way.

10:07.148 --> 10:09.859
You see the wonder in nature,
and you're starting to learn

10:09.859 --> 10:12.361
more about yourself
all the time.

10:12.361 --> 10:14.864
And you're learning that
there's something more important

10:14.864 --> 10:18.701
than you ever thought--
your brand.

10:18.701 --> 10:20.369
It's what defines you.

10:20.369 --> 10:22.538
And with brand management,
you can make sure

10:22.538 --> 10:26.625
others see you
the way they want to see you.

10:26.625 --> 10:29.545
Welcome to your
CumHammer Work tutorial.

10:29.545 --> 10:32.631
You are taking the first steps
to making your brand

10:32.631 --> 10:34.091
a great one.

10:34.091 --> 10:36.052
<i>By now you've received
your workbook</i>

10:36.052 --> 10:37.720
<i>and also
your brand slide tool</i>

10:37.720 --> 10:39.847
<i>and CumHammer
social-media drive</i>

10:39.847 --> 10:42.266
<i>which will be used
in this video.</i>

10:42.266 --> 10:44.685
<i>Now, if you're ready,
let's start the exercises</i>

10:44.685 --> 10:46.854
<i>on page five
of your workbook.</i>

10:53.110 --> 10:54.570
Yeah!

10:54.570 --> 10:56.781
Respect our privacy!

10:56.781 --> 10:58.949
Leave us alone!

10:58.949 --> 11:00.534
Down with the monarchy!

11:00.534 --> 11:02.453
We just want our privacy!

11:03.954 --> 11:06.791
God, fuck these people!

11:06.791 --> 11:08.292
Why are we so mad today?

11:08.292 --> 11:10.753
Because we want
our privacy!

11:12.838 --> 11:15.257
Park County Police Station.
What's your emergency?

11:15.257 --> 11:17.301
Yeah, the neighbors across the
street are setting off fireworks

11:17.301 --> 11:19.470
and it's
10:30 at night!

11:19.470 --> 11:20.971
Oh, is it the Prince of Canada
and his wife,

11:20.971 --> 11:22.473
who just want to be
left alone?

11:22.473 --> 11:24.517
Yes.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.395
They're being super loud, and
I'm trying to work on my brand!

11:27.395 --> 11:28.687
Oh, God damn it.

11:28.687 --> 11:30.398
Now the prince
is playing polo on the lawn!

11:33.609 --> 11:36.695
We are here because privacy
is a basic human right.

11:36.695 --> 11:39.115
How many more princes
and his wives

11:39.115 --> 11:41.200
have to live
in this nightmare?

11:44.203 --> 11:46.247
Hey, can you two
fucking keep it down?!

11:46.247 --> 11:47.665
Oy!

11:47.665 --> 11:49.250
You ever heard of a thing
called "privacy"?!

11:49.250 --> 11:50.501
Yeah, nobody gives
a shit.

11:50.501 --> 11:52.545
Will you two just shut up,
and go away?!

11:57.007 --> 11:59.051
It seriously is
driving me crazy!

11:59.051 --> 12:01.929
The prince plays drums all day.
I don't think he even has a job.

12:01.929 --> 12:04.140
And I don't know what the hell
<i>she</i> does.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.975
Why they even left Canada
is beyond me.

12:05.975 --> 12:07.768
And, like, she seems to just
boss him around,

12:07.768 --> 12:09.145
and make him do
whatever she wants.

12:09.145 --> 12:10.354
I mean, why did they even
leave Canada

12:10.354 --> 12:12.815
and move to South Park, anyway?

12:12.815 --> 12:14.942
Stan, are you gonna
say something?

12:14.942 --> 12:16.318
You say it.

12:16.318 --> 12:17.695
Say what?

12:17.695 --> 12:19.155
Look, Kyle...

12:19.155 --> 12:20.865
We just kinda don't care
about some dumb prince

12:20.865 --> 12:22.366
and his stupid wife.

12:22.366 --> 12:24.160
I don't care
about them either!

12:24.160 --> 12:27.037
So, then why do you talk
about them all the time?

12:28.998 --> 12:31.375
Dude, we're just kind of
sick of hearing about them.

12:31.375 --> 12:32.835
<i>I'm</i> sick of hearing
about them!

12:32.835 --> 12:34.628
But I can't get away
from them!

12:34.628 --> 12:36.797
They're everywhere!
In my fucking face!

12:36.797 --> 12:38.632
Yeah, and now you're putting 'em
in our fucking face.

12:38.632 --> 12:40.968
Fine, I won't talk
about them anymore.

12:40.968 --> 12:42.636
Thank you.

12:46.849 --> 12:49.351
Okay, just one last thing--
did you know the prince sleeps-

12:50.686 --> 12:51.937
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry!

12:54.023 --> 12:57.359
The problem with you is you
want results without the work.

12:57.359 --> 12:58.944
You can't just say
you're a certain thing,

12:58.944 --> 13:01.780
and then expect people
to just like your brand.

13:01.780 --> 13:04.783
You gotta work it,
sell people on it.

13:04.783 --> 13:06.410
But I just don't feel
like my brand

13:06.410 --> 13:08.370
is who I really am
on the inside.

13:08.370 --> 13:09.997
You know, Kyle,
some people think

13:09.997 --> 13:11.832
it's what's inside you
that matters.

13:11.832 --> 13:14.543
But people can't see
inside you.

13:14.543 --> 13:16.879
They can only see what kind of
drink you're drinking.

13:16.879 --> 13:18.380
That's what matters.

13:18.380 --> 13:19.798
I guess so.

13:19.798 --> 13:21.550
Now, I'm gonna help you
with a new brand,

13:21.550 --> 13:23.594
but you've got to
work on it.

13:23.594 --> 13:26.222
What do you want your friends
to think about you?

13:26.222 --> 13:29.725
I want them to think I'm not
gonna complain about things,

13:29.725 --> 13:30.893
I'm more thick-skinned.

13:30.893 --> 13:32.937
Okay. This is good.
This is good.

13:32.937 --> 13:35.314
And I want people to think
I'm stronger, mentally,

13:35.314 --> 13:36.524
than I probably am.

13:36.524 --> 13:38.150
Okay. Okay.
I think we got it.

13:38.150 --> 13:39.902
People are gonna
love this.

13:39.902 --> 13:42.863
Kyle-- he's a thick-skinned,
super cool,

13:42.863 --> 13:46.325
nothing bothers him victim.

13:46.325 --> 13:47.493
I just don't know
if I can--

13:47.493 --> 13:49.703
You're goin'
off brand already!

13:49.703 --> 13:53.832
Remember, no matter what,
nothing bothers you.

14:34.206 --> 14:36.500
I don't care.
Don't care.

14:41.839 --> 14:43.799
What the hell?
What'd he just say?

14:43.799 --> 14:44.967
He victimized me!

14:44.967 --> 14:46.594
It's because I'm
an ethnic woman!

14:46.594 --> 14:47.970
He can't do that!
I'll see--

14:47.970 --> 14:49.805
Wait, you're ethnic?
This is an outrage!

14:49.805 --> 14:52.391
We'll just see how he deals
with my blue penis!

15:10.117 --> 15:11.619
Hey!

15:11.619 --> 15:14.455
Have some respect
for this privacy!

15:39.021 --> 15:40.606
Don't worry,
my love,

15:40.606 --> 15:43.901
he's not gonna
get away with this.

16:06.924 --> 16:08.759
Hey, guys!
How you doin?!

16:08.759 --> 16:10.302
Good.
How are you?

16:10.302 --> 16:12.346
I'm great.
Got some good sleep last night.

16:12.346 --> 16:14.682
Just letting' things roll
right off my back, you know?

16:14.682 --> 16:16.934
'Cause that's the kind of guy
I am.

16:18.894 --> 16:20.521
Cool.

16:20.521 --> 16:22.314
Hey, do you guys wanna play
Darktide after school?

16:22.314 --> 16:25.067
Or if not, whatever.
I'm cool either way.

16:25.067 --> 16:27.069
Yeah, I'm sure we can
figure that out.

16:27.069 --> 16:29.363
Cool. Whatever.
I'm care-free and unflappable.

16:29.363 --> 16:30.948
I'll catch you guys
at lunch!

16:32.825 --> 16:34.827
Wow, Kyle,
you seem really different.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.078
Do you like it?

16:36.078 --> 16:37.830
Uh, Sure.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.331
Thanks, Jimmy.

16:39.331 --> 16:40.916
But you know, I really need
to thank a good friend.

16:40.916 --> 16:43.585
He introduced me to a way of
becoming a more stable person.

16:43.585 --> 16:44.837
Have you seen Butters?

16:44.837 --> 16:46.797
Butters?
Oh, sure.

16:46.797 --> 16:48.215
He's out on
the playground,

16:48.215 --> 16:49.675
getting the shit
beat out of him by Bebe.

16:49.675 --> 16:50.968
What?

16:52.761 --> 16:54.763
Mother! Fucker!

16:54.763 --> 16:57.433
Don't ever say
that shit again!

16:57.433 --> 16:59.351
Hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:59.351 --> 17:00.769
What the hell
is going on?!

17:00.769 --> 17:02.980
I wasn't even doing anything,
and he came up,

17:02.980 --> 17:04.940
and started
talking shit to me!

17:04.940 --> 17:07.401
Yeah, everyone likes a guy
that's strong and assertive,

17:07.401 --> 17:09.361
so I told Bebe
to go fuck herself.

17:09.361 --> 17:11.113
Who do you even think
you are?!

17:11.113 --> 17:12.781
You want some more of this,
you dumb slut?

17:12.781 --> 17:14.116
Butters,
what are you doing?

17:14.116 --> 17:15.367
This isn't you.

17:15.367 --> 17:16.785
Hey, Kyle,
will you relax.

17:16.785 --> 17:18.328
You're kind of fucking up
my brand.

17:18.328 --> 17:20.122
Okay, that does it--
come on, Butters.

17:20.122 --> 17:22.040
You're going back
to CumHammer.

17:22.040 --> 17:24.126
You're lucky
he saved your ass!

17:24.126 --> 17:26.962
Fuck you,
you fucking bitch!

17:26.962 --> 17:30.716
The most important thing about
your brand is being flexible.

17:30.716 --> 17:33.218
We want to make sure
you're completely satisfied.

17:33.218 --> 17:35.304
You say you're having
some problems?

17:35.304 --> 17:36.722
That's right!

17:36.722 --> 17:38.390
There's this
horrible spy

17:38.390 --> 17:39.808
who lives
across the street from us,

17:39.808 --> 17:41.894
and we're gonna get him back
by changing our brand!

17:41.894 --> 17:43.187
All right.

17:43.187 --> 17:44.897
And I do see
you're in our database,

17:44.897 --> 17:47.608
but you didn't first get help
at this CumHammer location?

17:47.608 --> 17:49.151
No.

17:49.151 --> 17:50.360
My wife went to one
in California as a child.

17:50.360 --> 17:51.779
Ah. Okay.

17:51.779 --> 17:53.197
Then you must be in
the national system.

17:53.197 --> 17:54.531
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Is this you?

17:54.531 --> 17:57.117
"Sorority girl, Actress,
Influencer, Victim."

17:57.117 --> 17:59.077
Yeah.
That's totally me.

17:59.077 --> 18:00.412
Okay. I see.

18:00.412 --> 18:01.622
And then,
you added your husband

18:01.622 --> 18:03.165
to your Friends and Family account.

18:03.165 --> 18:05.042
You must be the
"Royal prince, millionaire,

18:05.042 --> 18:06.919
world traveler,
victim."

18:06.919 --> 18:08.504
That's right.

18:08.504 --> 18:11.173
Come on, Butters.

18:11.173 --> 18:13.175
Hello?

18:13.175 --> 18:14.968
Oh, hey there.
Just gimme a minute.

18:14.968 --> 18:16.678
I'm with some other clients
right now, there, Kyle.

18:16.678 --> 18:18.472
Uh, no.
This is an emergency.

18:18.472 --> 18:19.848
We need to talk to--

18:19.848 --> 18:21.016
Oy! Do you mind!
Stop invading--

18:21.016 --> 18:22.976
It's him!

18:24.019 --> 18:25.229
What the hell
are you doing here?

18:25.229 --> 18:27.439
You just can't
leave us alone, can you!

18:27.439 --> 18:29.691
Oh, my God,
he's so obsessed with us.

18:29.691 --> 18:32.152
I'm not obsessed
with you.

18:32.152 --> 18:33.695
It's this
stupid place!

18:36.990 --> 18:38.450
Don't you see,
Butters?

18:38.450 --> 18:39.868
Teaching people
to think of their brand

18:39.868 --> 18:42.120
just makes
more people like them.

18:42.120 --> 18:43.580
This whole thing
is wrong.

18:43.580 --> 18:46.291
They're telling you guys to
reduce yourselves into products

18:46.291 --> 18:49.419
instead of people to be truly
understood and loved.

18:49.419 --> 18:52.047
Don't you guys want people
to like you for you

18:52.047 --> 18:55.425
instead of who they
want you to be?

18:55.425 --> 18:59.263
Look, we all have our faults.
God knows I do.

18:59.263 --> 19:01.598
But if we just try to present
and control an image of us

19:01.598 --> 19:04.393
for people to see, then,
we're just performers

19:04.393 --> 19:07.020
instead of
human beings.

19:07.020 --> 19:08.313
He's right.

19:08.313 --> 19:09.481
Trying to make ourselves
into a brand

19:09.481 --> 19:11.066
just turned us
into products.

19:11.066 --> 19:14.069
We don't need to be
a brand, do we?

19:14.069 --> 19:15.529
If it's truly
what we want,

19:15.529 --> 19:17.447
then we really can
get away from it all.

19:17.447 --> 19:19.449
No more magazines
and Netflix shows.

19:19.449 --> 19:21.577
We really can
live a normal life.

19:23.412 --> 19:25.080
Yes, I'm sure you agree, darling.

19:25.080 --> 19:27.499
We can be the people
we talked about being,

19:27.499 --> 19:29.376
with no more worries
about how we look

19:29.376 --> 19:31.295
or the image
we project to people.

19:31.295 --> 19:34.047
What matters is what
we have on the inside.

19:39.094 --> 19:40.470
Hello?

19:42.556 --> 19:44.850
Come on, Butters.
Time to go home.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.435
Yeah.

19:46.435 --> 19:49.897
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:49.897 --> 19:51.481
Now, hey.

19:51.481 --> 19:53.192
Don't make a decision
you might all regret.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.781
Yeah, come on, honey.
We don't need this place.

20:03.035 --> 20:04.161
Honey?

20:18.300 --> 20:21.303
The queen is dead.

20:21.303 --> 20:23.847
What a sad day for Canada--
and therefore, the world.

20:25.474 --> 20:26.934
Ike, I need to
use the--

20:26.934 --> 20:28.435
Oh no, not again.

20:28.435 --> 20:31.355
She's still dead.

20:31.355 --> 20:32.981
Ike, I have to get on
the computer.

20:32.981 --> 20:34.608
The Queen's been dead
a long time.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.528
Ike, I have to get on
with my friends!

20:38.528 --> 20:40.447
If I don't,
they're gonna think I'm...

20:43.867 --> 20:45.744
It's okay.

20:45.744 --> 20:47.663
Things get to you.

20:47.663 --> 20:49.498
It's who you are.

20:59.341 --> 21:01.134
Oh. Hey, guys.

21:01.134 --> 21:02.928
Hey, dude. Uh...

21:02.928 --> 21:04.930
We thought maybe you could do
with a little outside time.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.431
Really?

21:06.431 --> 21:07.975
