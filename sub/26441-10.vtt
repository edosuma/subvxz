12:22.400 --> 12:24.232
You are. You have to be.

12:25.160 --> 12:26.160
If you kill him,

12:26.240 --> 12:28.480
I can't have you travel with me.
That's if you even live.

12:30.120 --> 12:31.600
- I understand.
- No, you don't.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.516
We're going to rescue hostages. Anything
that compromises them is dangerous.

12:35.960 --> 12:38.031
And if you kill him,
you become the same as him.

12:39.200 --> 12:40.200
I ain't having that.

12:40.840 --> 12:41.956
I'm serious, Graham.

12:46.560 --> 12:47.560
And so am I.

12:49.760 --> 12:52.878
RYAN: That's all you remember, being
back on your ship without your crew?

12:52.960 --> 12:54.096
PALTRAKI: Nothing before that.

12:54.120 --> 12:56.715
There's a reason I should have left.

12:57.520 --> 12:58.874
I can nearly remember.

12:59.520 --> 13:01.113
The Doctor said don't push.

13:01.400 --> 13:02.993
The memories will return.

13:03.400 --> 13:04.400
Hey, Yaz, look.

13:04.840 --> 13:05.990
You all seeing those?

13:12.280 --> 13:14.795
- What happened here?
- PALTRAKI: Those that came before us.

13:15.680 --> 13:17.273
That failed and fell.

13:19.120 --> 13:21.715
The vanquished of Ranskoor Av Kolos.

13:22.720 --> 13:24.791
But that's not all, look beyond.

13:26.040 --> 13:28.111
What are you looking at?

13:28.200 --> 13:29.714
Look at the mists.

13:32.160 --> 13:35.232
Through the battlefield,
on to the edifice.

13:35.600 --> 13:37.273
That was our destination.

13:38.200 --> 13:40.096
RYAN: We're not going
to go through that, are we?

13:40.120 --> 13:42.160
No one in their right mind's
gonna go through there.

14:03.320 --> 14:04.834
RYAN: What do you think's inside?

14:06.040 --> 14:08.794
DOCTOR: Other than Tim Shaw,
I don't know.

14:14.960 --> 14:16.235
Equipment.

14:18.960 --> 14:21.111
I borrowed all this
from your ship, Paltraki.

14:21.840 --> 14:24.196
These throat mics work like commdots.

14:24.440 --> 14:26.477
Side of the neck. Stay in contact.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Take one each.

14:30.760 --> 14:33.753
Grenades, codebreakers
for doors... Also,

14:34.320 --> 14:35.320
a bomb.

14:35.480 --> 14:36.776
What happened to "never do weapons"?

14:36.800 --> 14:38.439
It's a flexible creed.

14:38.520 --> 14:41.752
Doors, locks, walls, buildings,
fair game.

14:42.120 --> 14:43.759
If it can be rebuilt, I'll allow it.

14:44.080 --> 14:46.136
No, no, you stopped me
trying to shoot the Sniperbots before.

14:46.160 --> 14:49.312
You were new. I have to lay down
the rules if someone's new.

14:49.800 --> 14:51.234
Also, don't quote that back to me.

14:51.680 --> 14:53.080
My rules change all the time.

14:54.080 --> 14:55.116
Be careful with them.

14:57.280 --> 14:58.976
You've got your trackers.
As far as I can decipher,

14:59.000 --> 15:00.832
the golden markers
on your devices

15:00.920 --> 15:02.560
relate to your
original mission purpose...

15:02.680 --> 15:04.637
- (DEVICE BLEEPS)
- ...for Paltraki and his crew.

15:05.040 --> 15:07.191
Which must connect to this object.

15:07.960 --> 15:10.919
That's where I want you both to head.
See what you can find.

15:11.280 --> 15:12.555
Graham, Ryan,

15:12.720 --> 15:14.871
you've got life signal markers
on your devices.

15:15.120 --> 15:16.395
Head to that area

15:16.560 --> 15:17.880
and rescue Paltraki's crew.

15:18.160 --> 15:19.913
What about you? Where are you heading?

15:20.080 --> 15:21.594
I'm gonna find our friend.

15:22.520 --> 15:23.840
I want to come with you.

15:24.720 --> 15:25.949
No.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.154
What will you do once you find him?

15:30.360 --> 15:33.239
Find out what this is
and why it's so precious to him.

15:33.720 --> 15:37.680
Oh, I might need
a bit of a negotiation leverage.

15:37.840 --> 15:39.240
(SIGHS)

15:40.320 --> 15:41.496
RYAN: What are you doing with those?

- As insurance policy.

15:44.680 --> 15:46.114
You think that's smart?

15:46.320 --> 15:47.436
I think it's a precaution.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.600
I like precautions.
Always take precautions.

15:49.640 --> 15:51.560
Especially when you don't know
what you're doing.

have brought wellies.

16:12.120 --> 16:14.616
That could have been another precaution,
"always bring wellies."

16:14.640 --> 16:17.758
I love wellies.
In fact, I think I half-invented them.

16:18.520 --> 16:20.432
YASMIN: And you think
this is the best way in?

16:20.560 --> 16:23.758
DOCTOR: (PANTING) Closest thing
to a front door this building's got.

Don't aliens bother with doors?

16:51.360 --> 16:54.194
- The building dragged us in.
- So they know we're here.

16:54.320 --> 16:56.391
Be quiet and get moving. Come on.

16:57.920 --> 16:59.513
You all know what you have to do.

17:04.319 --> 17:06.576
GRAHAM: You see anything?
RYAN: Of course I can't see anything,

17:06.599 --> 17:08.319
I'm looking at the same things as you.

17:09.119 --> 17:10.473
I know what you're thinking.

17:11.079 --> 17:12.480
Is that right?

17:13.760 --> 17:16.194
You want to get to him for Nan.
Hold that.

17:17.400 --> 17:18.595
Do I really?

17:18.680 --> 17:21.280
Why don't you just concentrate
on what we're supposed to be doing?

17:21.440 --> 17:23.193
You think that's what Nan would want?

17:23.319 --> 17:26.074
No, I think your nan
would want to be alive.

17:27.319 --> 17:29.960
She actually liked being alive
and she was really good at it.

17:30.760 --> 17:31.760
And she'd say to me,

17:31.840 --> 17:36.471
"Graham, if you get the chance,
you send that blue piece of rubbish

17:36.560 --> 17:38.313
"to kingdom come."

17:42.480 --> 17:45.473
(WHISPERING) Your nan
might have been kind,

17:45.560 --> 17:48.837
but she was also tougher
than you and me put together.

17:48.920 --> 17:50.559
- And what about the rest of us?
- No.

17:50.640 --> 17:53.758
Me, Yaz, and the Doctor.
I thought we were a team.

Look, we did not get rid
of that thing properly.

18:02.320 --> 18:03.760
Right? And now look what's happened.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.832
- Shut up.
- What, because you know I'm right?

18:07.920 --> 18:09.274
No, really, shut up!

18:54.920 --> 18:56.070
DOCTOR: I'm no one.

18:56.240 --> 18:58.197
But I have something
you might be interested in.

18:58.640 --> 19:00.438
Where is the object?

19:00.920 --> 19:02.798
Never talk in the face of a gun.

Point of principle. Please put it down.

19:07.920 --> 19:09.320
It's going to be like that, is it?

19:09.960 --> 19:10.960
Fine.

19:11.080 --> 19:12.760
I've attached
a couple of explosive devices

19:12.840 --> 19:14.354
to your object here on my back.

19:15.200 --> 19:17.760
So shoot and you jeopardise
whatever this thing is.

19:19.240 --> 19:20.356
And what is it?

19:20.680 --> 19:23.070
Come on! Share with the class.

19:23.560 --> 19:25.074
Where is Paltraki?

19:25.200 --> 19:27.481
I'm not answering your questions
if you don't answer mine.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.912
Are his other two crew members
still alive?

19:33.280 --> 19:34.280
Yes.

19:34.680 --> 19:36.273
See, that wasn't so hard.

19:36.960 --> 19:39.156
And good. Thank you.

19:40.720 --> 19:42.757
Why didn't you stop that woman
from being killed?

19:47.560 --> 19:48.676
What's your name?

19:51.000 --> 19:55.074
I am Andinio of the Ux.

19:55.280 --> 19:57.397
Are you kidding, the Ux?

19:57.480 --> 19:59.199
As in the duo species?

19:59.440 --> 20:02.035
Only ever two of you?
Lifespan of millennia?

20:02.360 --> 20:04.556
Only found on three planets
in the whole universe.

20:04.760 --> 20:08.151
I've never met an Ux.
Congratulations, it must be so cool.

20:08.280 --> 20:09.953
Wait, there's something else.

20:12.440 --> 20:13.715
Oh, I can't remember.

20:15.120 --> 20:16.759
What happened here, Andinio?

20:16.960 --> 20:19.634
Make sense of it for me.
The battle zone outside?

20:20.840 --> 20:24.311
They came for the Creator.
We defended him.

20:24.480 --> 20:26.119
(GASPS) I've remembered.

20:26.400 --> 20:27.550
Wait.

20:28.960 --> 20:30.679
Is this yours, this building?

what's important, or...

We were the last fleet.

When the others didn't come back,
they sent for us.

That's what my teachers used to say,
usuallyjust as they quit teaching.

22:48.240 --> 22:50.436
I've got so many questions, Andinio,

22:50.840 --> 22:53.400

we never believed any of this
was possible.

We can take these people home,
save you the job.

47:36.080 --> 47:38.515
No, I'm going to complete my mission.

47:40.760 --> 47:42.911
- Then take us, too.
- Delph.

47:43.720 --> 47:46.838
This is our home. We must stay here.

47:47.280 --> 47:48.280
No.

47:49.320 --> 47:51.277
We need to understand what's out there.

47:54.160 --> 47:55.196
Find another home.

47:57.480 --> 47:59.119
You'll have to sleep on the floor.

47:59.480 --> 48:01.312
I walked this planet for decades.

48:02.000 --> 48:03.070
Floors are fine.

48:05.520 --> 48:06.520
(INHALES SHARPLY)

48:06.800 --> 48:08.314
Where will you go, now?

48:10.080 --> 48:11.753
(EXHALES SHARPLY) No idea.

48:13.400 --> 48:14.400
Come on, fam.

48:15.000 --> 48:16.559
I thought we weren't doing "fam."

48:17.440 --> 48:18.440
I like it.

48:25.280 --> 48:27.033
None of us know for sure
what's out there.

48:27.880 --> 48:29.109
That's why we keep looking.

48:30.560 --> 48:31.560
Keep your faith.

48:33.400 --> 48:34.595
Travel hopefully.

48:35.400 --> 48:36.800
The universe will surprise you.

48:38.360 --> 48:39.360
Constantly.

48:45.440 --> 48:46.440
(CREAKING)

48:50.320 --> 48:53.119
(TARDIS WHOOSHING)

48:58.520 --> 49:00.512
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

49:32.000 --> 49:34.231
Here's a new year message
for you to send...

49:34.320 --> 49:38.234
Earth is protected by me and my mates
this year and every other.
