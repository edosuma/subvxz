They're fixing the green
line at Petworth connecting

00:12.050 --> 00:14.050
red line trains are stuck
waiting at Fort Totten,

00:14.051 --> 00:15.551
which puts the next
train to Shady Grove

00:15.552 --> 00:17.520
- about 20 seconds away.
- Thank you.

00:24.393 --> 00:26.161
Look at that.
Just like you predicted.

00:27.596 --> 00:29.097
- Are you here tomorrow?
- Every day.

00:29.115 --> 00:30.298
Coffee's on me.

Look up.

00:58.860 --> 01:00.144
Look down.

01:00.429 --> 01:01.462
Good.

01:01.480 --> 01:02.780
Everything looks good.

01:02.831 --> 01:04.265
If everything stays
looking this good,

01:04.299 --> 01:05.933
you can go home in the morning.

01:05.951 --> 01:08.836
Hey, is that guy bothering you?
I can kick him out.

01:08.870 --> 01:10.171
(Chuckles) (Chuckles)

01:12.206 --> 01:13.624
This is such an honor, sir.

01:14.158 --> 01:16.375
- I voted for you.
- Well, thank you

01:16.393 --> 01:17.794
for taking such good care
of my friend, Dr. Walker.

01:17.828 --> 01:19.262
Yes, sir.

01:19.296 --> 01:21.448
Wow. Yes.

01:22.616 --> 01:25.135
(Door opens and closes)

01:40.684 --> 01:41.818
- Stop.
- Liv...

01:41.852 --> 01:42.886
- Please stop.
- Liv...

01:42.920 --> 01:44.888
- I hate you.
- I know.

01:46.624 --> 01:48.174
(Lowered voice)
You left me all alone.

01:48.209 --> 01:50.860
(Lowered voice)
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

01:53.047 --> 01:54.697
I didn't know how...

01:56.117 --> 01:57.317
I was hurt,

01:57.351 --> 02:00.620
and I was wrong, and I'm sorry.

02:01.954 --> 02:03.371
I don't forgive you.

02:03.406 --> 02:04.923
You are not forgiven.

02:04.957 --> 02:06.274
- Livvie, please...
- No.

02:06.309 --> 02:07.909
You can't do this to me.

02:07.944 --> 02:09.428
(Voice breaking) You can't
say these things.

02:09.461 --> 02:11.897
You can't treat me
like I'm some whore

02:11.931 --> 02:13.899
- you got off the street.
- I love you.

02:13.933 --> 02:15.535
- You keep saying that
- <i>I</i> love you.

02:15.602 --> 02:19.204
Like it means something.
I don't believe you.

02:19.238 --> 02:21.339
I... don't...

02:21.374 --> 02:24.426
Believe you anymore.

02:34.519 --> 02:36.937
(Sighs) What happened?

02:36.971 --> 02:38.138
She didn't tell you?

02:38.189 --> 02:39.456
No. I'm asking you.

02:39.491 --> 02:40.857
She was coming home.

02:40.875 --> 02:42.392
Right outside her apartment
door, and she was attacked.

02:42.427 --> 02:44.378
- Did you see who it was?
- No.

02:44.412 --> 02:46.163
- Find out.
- Yes, sir.

02:51.219 --> 02:52.736
Maybe we should
try to move him.

02:52.771 --> 02:54.755
He likes it there.
His back's against the wall,

02:54.789 --> 02:56.373
his feet are on the ground.
(Breathing heavily)

02:56.407 --> 02:58.292
I think it makes him
feel safe.
(Door opens)

02:58.326 --> 02:59.460
(Door closes)

03:00.111 --> 03:01.294
I found her.

03:01.328 --> 03:02.629
Where?

03:02.663 --> 03:04.731
James Madison hospital.
She was brought in

03:04.765 --> 03:06.616
with a concussion
a few hours ago.
Oh, my God.

03:06.650 --> 03:08.051
They wouldn't tell me
how it happened,

03:08.085 --> 03:09.402
just that they're keeping her
overnight for observation.

03:09.487 --> 03:11.721
Huck attacked the same night
Liv gets hurt?

03:11.755 --> 03:12.857
Doesn't smell right.

03:12.890 --> 03:14.190
It's gotta be the guy
in the baseball cap,

03:14.191 --> 03:15.191
the one working for albatross.

03:15.209 --> 03:17.042
He led huck to that
storage unit.

03:17.077 --> 03:17.861
He set him up.
He knew we would track

03:17.895 --> 03:19.212
that payment from
Molly's bank account.

03:19.246 --> 03:20.814
He knows we're on to him.

03:20.848 --> 03:23.616
Liv's not safe. (Sighs)
(Sighs)

03:23.667 --> 03:27.237
I'll go down there.
(Huck muttering indistinctly)

03:27.271 --> 03:29.739
- 752, 752...
- Did he...

03:29.757 --> 03:31.207
- 752...
- Huck?

03:31.241 --> 03:33.209
752... 752...

03:33.244 --> 03:35.979
- Slow down, Huck.
We can't understand. - 752...

03:36.013 --> 03:37.797
752... se...

03:37.832 --> 03:39.999
752.
(Gasps) 752.

03:40.034 --> 03:43.085
(Gasps) 752, 752...

03:43.104 --> 03:45.371
- 752.
- What the hell is 752?

03:45.423 --> 03:47.123
752, 752,

03:47.158 --> 03:49.642

that Alice found

04:05.758 --> 04:07.208
"was a little cake,

04:07.226 --> 04:09.710
"and it had the words
'eat me' written on it.

04:09.729 --> 04:11.229
"So of course she set to work,

04:11.263 --> 04:13.765
"and she ate it all up.

"And then do you know
what happened next?

04:15.935 --> 04:17.885
You will never guess."
(Children laughing)

04:17.903 --> 04:19.887
"Alice grew..."
(Laughter continues)

04:19.904 --> 04:22.055
"And she grew and she grew.

04:22.074 --> 04:24.192
"Taller than she was before!

04:24.226 --> 04:26.611
Taller than
any grownup person!"

04:26.662 --> 04:29.531
(Laughter continues) "Taller
and and taller and taller!

04:29.565 --> 04:30.698
"Just look at the picture,

04:30.732 --> 04:32.751
and you can see how
tall she grew."

04:32.785 --> 04:34.452
What...

(Gasps)

04:35.588 --> 04:38.890
(Gasps) Oh, my God!

04:38.924 --> 04:41.209

Hey! Hey!

Hey!
(Laughs) Hey.

04:44.130 --> 04:45.213
Oh, my...

04:45.247 --> 04:47.748
(Children) Ew!
(Both laughing)

04:47.767 --> 04:49.851
(Children clapping)

04:49.885 --> 04:51.719
(Huck) Oh...

04:53.088 --> 04:54.856
I can't believe you're here.

04:54.890 --> 04:56.357
In the flesh.
(Exhales)

04:56.392 --> 04:57.942
I mean, you're really here.

04:57.977 --> 05:00.195
And, oh, God, you smell good.

05:00.229 --> 05:01.980
(Exhales)

05:02.031 --> 05:03.481
You smell like my guy.

05:03.532 --> 05:05.316
You know, there's this
old t-shirt of yours

05:05.367 --> 05:07.952
that I sleep in, but it stopped
smelling like you ages ago,

05:07.987 --> 05:10.121
and I just can't...

05:10.156 --> 05:11.823
(Exhales)

05:11.874 --> 05:12.957
Hug me tighter.

05:12.992 --> 05:15.276
(Exhales) I'm home now.

05:15.294 --> 05:17.111
Yeah.

05:17.129 --> 05:19.464
So what happened?

05:19.498 --> 05:20.999
Why'd they cut the tour short?

05:21.050 --> 05:22.283
I don't know.
I...

05:22.301 --> 05:25.637
I got orders.
They put me on a plane.

05:25.671 --> 05:27.755
I have some meeting tomorrow.

05:27.789 --> 05:29.757
- Is that bad?
- I don't think so.

05:29.791 --> 05:32.360
- Remember I told you they had
me take those tests? - Uh-huh.

05:32.394 --> 05:33.778
I think it's about that.

05:33.829 --> 05:35.780
I think they're gonna offer
me a job or something.

05:35.815 --> 05:37.265
A job?

05:37.283 --> 05:38.683
- Yeah.
- A government job?

05:38.717 --> 05:41.319
Here, in D.C., and I get to
see you every single day?

05:41.353 --> 05:42.470
And every night.
Oh...

05:42.488 --> 05:43.905
Mmm...

05:43.939 --> 05:45.540
It's just a meeting, so we
shouldn't get our hopes us.

05:45.558 --> 05:46.724
Oh, please.

05:46.775 --> 05:49.477
These government dudes
are gonna love you.

05:49.512 --> 05:51.196
Everybody loves you.

05:58.053 --> 06:00.288
Uh, sir...

06:07.528 --> 06:10.164
(Clears throat) You're hired.

06:10.198 --> 06:11.298
(Clicks pen) What?

06:11.332 --> 06:12.583
The position is yours
if you want it.

06:12.634 --> 06:15.035
Sir, what exactly
is the position?

06:15.053 --> 06:16.420
This is the starting salary.

06:16.471 --> 06:18.305
Although, you can earn
two to three times that

06:18.339 --> 06:20.207
- if you do a good job.
- What's the job?

06:20.225 --> 06:21.558
What do you think?

06:21.593 --> 06:23.060
I think I've never heard
of a private first class

06:23.094 --> 06:24.661
being offered this much
money to do anything.

06:24.696 --> 06:27.380
(Scoffs and chuckles)

06:27.398 --> 06:28.932
You took a series of tests.

06:28.983 --> 06:31.101
Your test results suggested
that you have skills

06:31.152 --> 06:33.120
that go way beyond that
of a private first class.

06:33.154 --> 06:34.173
Like what?

06:34.177 --> 06:36.206
We can test a thousand men
and not find one like you.

06:36.207 --> 06:39.693
You're gifted. You have
an aptitude, a quality,

06:39.727 --> 06:42.696
a series of personality traits
that we find very valuable here.

06:42.730 --> 06:44.114
Here isn't the marines, is it?

06:44.165 --> 06:45.365
What do you think?

06:45.399 --> 06:47.534
I think we're in a
nondescript office park.

06:47.568 --> 06:49.620
The door claims this is
a paper company,

06:49.671 --> 06:51.889
but who names a paper
company Acme Limited?

06:51.923 --> 06:53.540
There are cameras in
the ceiling there...

06:53.574 --> 06:54.958
And there.

06:55.009 --> 06:57.911
Your suit is nice, but not
nice enough to draw attention.

06:57.929 --> 06:59.263
And then there's
the guy behind me

06:59.297 --> 07:01.048
with a bulge in his pocket
that I'm pretty sure

07:01.082 --> 07:02.466
isn't there because
he's happy to see me.

07:02.517 --> 07:04.268
I'm pretty sure it's a gun.

07:04.302 --> 07:06.086
So, while I'm a big fan
of the C.I.A.,

07:06.104 --> 07:08.922
I have to say thank you,
but no.

07:08.940 --> 07:11.775
You'll take this job or go back
to Kosovo on another tour.

07:11.809 --> 07:14.144
Those are your
only two options.

07:14.195 --> 07:16.196
Do you like Kosovo, soldier?

07:17.448 --> 07:19.933
- No.
- Sit down.

07:22.120 --> 07:24.655
You were abandoned when
you were 3 years old.

07:24.706 --> 07:26.156
Raised in foster care.

07:26.207 --> 07:27.457
Five, six homes?

07:27.508 --> 07:29.026
No parents, no family.
Is that right?

07:29.060 --> 07:30.244
Yes, sir.

07:30.278 --> 07:31.912
No wife, no kids?

07:31.946 --> 07:33.130
No wife, no kids.

07:33.181 --> 07:34.214
Good.

07:35.300 --> 07:37.601
That's how we like it.

07:37.652 --> 07:40.337
We'll be your family.
We'll take care of you.

07:40.371 --> 07:41.755
We'll train you, we'll pay you.

07:41.789 --> 07:43.190
We'll teach you
things about yourself

07:43.224 --> 07:44.591
that you never imagined possible.

07:44.626 --> 07:46.860
This is wonderland, son.
Your whole life changes

07:46.894 --> 07:48.462
right now, today.

07:48.496 --> 07:50.897
All you have to do is say yes.

08:06.547 --> 08:07.614
Yes.

08:13.471 --> 08:15.222
Welcome to B613.

08:26.729 --> 08:27.729
You can't tie up the
whole floor, gentlemen.

08:27.763 --> 08:29.197
We could, sir, but we're not.

08:29.231 --> 08:31.065
- So let me into room 312.
- Not possible.

08:31.400 --> 08:32.832
Look, I don't want to
see the president.

08:32.868 --> 08:34.434
I don't want to sneak a
photo or steal his chart.

08:34.469 --> 08:35.937
I don't want to be
anywhere near your boss,

08:35.971 --> 08:38.289
but I have to see <i>my</i> boss,
and I have to see her now!

08:38.323 --> 08:39.974
And according to the
secret service charter,

08:40.008 --> 08:41.775
you cannot legally restrict
my movements

08:41.793 --> 08:43.327
unless they risk the
security of the president.

08:43.361 --> 08:45.630
So unless the president is
sharing my boss' hospital room,

08:45.664 --> 08:47.682
I expect the freedom of
movement granted to me

08:47.716 --> 08:49.150
by the constitution, et cetera.

08:49.784 --> 08:51.368
- I understand, sir.
- So you'll let me go?

08:51.402 --> 08:52.820
No, sir.

09:01.329 --> 09:02.796
I see.

09:04.899 --> 09:06.066
Okay.

09:08.002 --> 09:09.286
Uh, secret service is here.

09:09.337 --> 09:10.721
There's no way
I'm getting to her.

09:13.775 --> 09:15.292
Hey!
Gotta go.

09:15.343 --> 09:16.743
Hey! Hey!
(Elevator bell dings)

09:20.949 --> 09:22.032
(Doors close)

09:40.400 --> 09:42.601
(Panting)

09:42.636 --> 09:43.802
(Elevator bell dings)

09:47.540 --> 09:48.541
(Exhales)

09:48.542 --> 09:50.410
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking) We were right.

09:50.444 --> 09:52.011
Baseball cap.
He was at the hospital.

09:52.445 --> 09:54.063
- Are you... you're sure?
- Yeah. I saw him.

09:54.497 --> 09:56.415
- Did you tell Liv?
- (Sighs) I couldn't get in to see her.

09:56.449 --> 09:59.601
- What? Harrison!
- Don't worry. She's safe.

09:59.652 --> 10:02.754
There's some V.I.P.
type on her floor.

10:02.789 --> 10:03.922
There's a lot of security.

10:03.956 --> 10:05.624
No one's getting in
or out of there tonight.

10:05.658 --> 10:06.925
Abby, she's safe.

10:06.960 --> 10:09.061

protect her

10:12.131 --> 10:13.732

752. 752. 752.

10:18.121 --> 10:20.005
(Sighs) So what do we do now?

10:20.039 --> 10:23.041
752. 752. 752.

10:23.076 --> 10:26.812

(Groans) But... whatever
saves him the bucks, right?

10:38.257 --> 10:40.525
Okay.
So...

10:40.543 --> 10:43.278
We kill people.

10:44.012 --> 10:46.030
That's the job. That's what you
signed up for. (Weapon clatters)

10:46.064 --> 10:47.331
Ah, I'm getting ahead
of myself here.

10:47.849 --> 10:50.334
We don't just kill.
We torture people, right?

10:50.368 --> 10:52.035
And we get the information
we need, then we kill them.

10:52.070 --> 10:53.970
We're neat, we're smooth,
we're thorough.

10:53.988 --> 10:55.288
We leave no trace.

10:55.323 --> 10:57.724
Ah, I see you looking
at the door.

10:57.759 --> 10:59.259
That's a normal reaction.
(Clattering)

10:59.310 --> 11:01.411
But there are no outs here,
my friend, no take-backs.

11:01.446 --> 11:03.630
You signed a contract
with the U.S. government.

11:03.664 --> 11:05.265
You agreed to serve
your country.

11:05.299 --> 11:07.817
The job... it's no different
than the marines.

11:07.835 --> 11:10.687
The people we target...
They're enemies of the state.

11:10.721 --> 11:12.989
Traitors. They would
do this nation harm,

11:13.007 --> 11:15.325
same as the combatants you would
have happily popped in Kosovo.

11:15.343 --> 11:16.426
The only difference being...

11:16.444 --> 11:18.295
Most of them
are American citizens.

11:18.729 --> 11:20.196
(Clatter) Six of one.

11:20.231 --> 11:21.714

Go ahead, open it up.

- and long veils.

- All the same fabric, but
different styles... - 752...

the bridesmaids... - 752...

Doyle stole my future. - 752, 752, 752..

being locked in that crate got you.

it means or what happened or why.

- 752, 752...
- But you're letting it eat you alive.

and you can't do that. - 752, 752...

18:52.493 --> 18:54.010
(Muffled shouting)
I'll start with the toes.

18:54.044 --> 18:57.113
Your toes, or the name
of your contact.

18:57.147 --> 18:59.982
Makes no difference to me.
(Muffled gasping)

19:00.017 --> 19:01.667
Toes it is.

19:01.702 --> 19:02.885

19:38.470 --> 19:39.888
There's something I'd like to go over

19:39.955 --> 19:42.089
before we begin, Mr. Collins...
Can I call you Marcus?

19:42.107 --> 19:43.174
Would that be all right?
(Whimpering)

19:43.208 --> 19:44.492
See, Marcus,
you need to understand

19:44.626 --> 19:46.360
that pain is the only
human process

19:46.394 --> 19:49.046
that is completely defined
by the person experiencing it.

19:49.080 --> 19:50.581
Now, the more I do this,
the more I learn

19:50.632 --> 19:52.232
that people are very
different in how they red

19:52.267 --> 19:54.001
to the pain I put them through.

19:54.035 --> 19:56.336
You say "potato," I say
"buh-buh," that type of idea.

19:56.354 --> 19:59.206
Now, I would say that
the majority... maybe 90%...

19:59.240 --> 20:00.974
of my projects scream out
right away.

20:01.008 --> 20:02.893
But then some surprise me.

20:02.927 --> 20:04.578
They grit their teeth
for as long as they can

20:04.612 --> 20:06.063
until they pass out,

20:06.097 --> 20:07.648
and they never
make any sound at all.

20:07.682 --> 20:09.383
Now they're not any
braver than anyone else.

20:09.417 --> 20:11.301
They're just different,
which is what makes this job

20:11.352 --> 20:12.603
so very interesting.

20:12.654 --> 20:15.255
You really get to see
what people are made of.

20:15.290 --> 20:16.423
Literally.

20:16.457 --> 20:17.674
So...
(Clatter)

20:19.027 --> 20:20.961
Who are you?

20:20.995 --> 20:23.397
Are you a screamer, or...

20:23.431 --> 20:25.349
the strong and silent type?

20:25.400 --> 20:26.750
(Twists) Let's find out.

Oh, my God, it hurts!
It hurts so bad!

20:45.619 --> 20:48.103
- I can't!
- Yes, you can! You can do it, Kim.

20:48.138 --> 20:49.655
(Sobbing) You do whatever you
need to to get through it.

20:49.689 --> 20:51.457

(Monitor beeping)

20:51.491 --> 20:53.108

I love you...

20:54.227 --> 20:55.477
All right, Kim,
I can see the head.

20:55.529 --> 20:56.662
Just one more push should do it.
(Exhales)

20:56.696 --> 20:57.796
I should warn you, daddy...

20:57.831 --> 20:59.131
If you're the fainting type,

20:59.165 --> 21:00.733
it's gonna get a little
bloody right now.

21:00.767 --> 21:02.368
- I'll be good.
- Okay, Kim.

(Exhales)
Fancy meeting you here.

22:27.258 --> 22:28.892
You know what happens
if a bored nurse

22:28.926 --> 22:30.961
or an arrogant doctor
tweets that the president,

22:30.995 --> 22:33.063
the same one who was shot
in the head ten months ago,

22:33.097 --> 22:34.998
is in the hospital
in the middle of the night?

22:35.032 --> 22:38.785
Markets panic, reporters swarm,
defcon levels change.

22:38.819 --> 22:40.353
Cats and dogs
will finally get along?

22:42.106 --> 22:43.573
Sir...

22:43.807 --> 22:46.476
You have no idea how much
damage control this requires.

22:46.510 --> 22:48.294
The lies I've had to tell
James Madison

22:48.329 --> 22:50.229
in order to replace
their staff on this floor

22:50.264 --> 22:52.565
with military personnel who
won't tell the "New York Times"

22:52.583 --> 22:54.267
that the president
of the United States

22:54.301 --> 22:55.668
is here on a late-night booty call.

22:55.703 --> 22:58.037
I'm here. I'm staying here
until Olivia is discharged,

22:58.055 --> 22:59.205
because that's what you do

22:59.239 --> 23:00.540
when someone you love
is in the hospital.

23:00.574 --> 23:01.891
You're welcome to wait here with me,

23:01.925 --> 23:03.276
run whatever kind of
interference you think is best,

23:03.310 --> 23:05.127
but I'm here.
(Door opens)

23:05.262 --> 23:07.379
I'm sure you've got an army
of secret service agents

23:07.397 --> 23:09.214
that know your exact
cream-to-sugar ratio,

23:09.249 --> 23:10.599
- but I just thought, as long
as I was down there... - Thanks.

23:10.633 --> 23:11.884
- Mm-hmm.
- Cyrus,

23:11.918 --> 23:13.952
meet captain Jake Ballard.

23:15.087 --> 23:15.820
Cyrus Beene.

23:15.855 --> 23:18.190
Jake here is the man who
brought the hostages home

23:18.224 --> 23:20.625
and got Liv out of
a dicey situation tonight.

23:21.059 --> 23:22.227
He is a man of many talents.

23:22.261 --> 23:24.546
I'll bet you are.

752...

23:31.287 --> 23:33.972
752...

23:34.006 --> 23:36.291
- "752." I can't blame you.
- 752...

23:36.342 --> 23:38.193
- This job. (Chuckles) It's relentless.
- 752, 752...

23:38.227 --> 23:40.629
- The clients, the hours,
the loyalty to her. - 752...

23:40.680 --> 23:42.814
- 752...
- That's it, right?

23:42.849 --> 23:45.250
- 752?
-752...

23:45.284 --> 23:46.885
- The number of times you've
done something for her...- 752...

23:46.919 --> 23:48.036
Without ever asking why.

23:48.070 --> 23:52.340
752... 752...

23:52.375 --> 23:54.376
752...

23:54.410 --> 23:56.244
- That day...
- 752...

23:57.579 --> 24:00.263
- I went to David's, and I told
him I loved him... - 752...

24:00.281 --> 24:02.683
- And then we were in bed for
hours, and I was... - 752...

24:02.717 --> 24:07.387
- I was so happy. I was... (Sighs)
- 752... 752...

24:07.438 --> 24:10.007
- It felt good being with David.
It felt good. - 752...

24:10.041 --> 24:13.060
I was just relieved to know that
I wasn't wrong about him.

24:13.111 --> 24:14.745
- 752...
- That he really did love me,

24:14.779 --> 24:16.630
- and I was right about him.
- 752...

24:16.714 --> 24:18.916
I was right. I was right!
(Pants)

24:18.950 --> 24:20.817
- 752...
- If someone

24:20.835 --> 24:22.452
punches you enough times
and tells you

24:22.486 --> 24:24.137
- that you're worthless...
- 752...

24:24.172 --> 24:25.956
- If...
- 752...

24:25.974 --> 24:28.525
The man who's supposed
to love you, your husband,

24:28.560 --> 24:31.161
- does that enough...
- 752...

24:31.195 --> 24:34.882
- You stop thinking you can be
right about anything. - 752...

24:35.516 --> 24:37.434
- But I was right about David.
- 752...

24:37.468 --> 24:39.652
He loved me.
I was right.

24:39.687 --> 24:41.421
752...

24:41.455 --> 24:43.623
But Olivia loves me, too.

24:43.674 --> 24:45.258
- 752... - She has a hell
of a way of showing it,

24:45.309 --> 24:46.743
- but she does.
- 752...

24:46.777 --> 24:48.761
She rescued me from my husband.
He was gonna kill me.

24:48.796 --> 24:50.563
- And she rescued me.
- 752...

24:50.598 --> 24:53.416
- 752... - So David might love
me, but I owe Olivia my life.

24:54.034 --> 24:55.584
- That's how she gets you.
- 752...

24:55.619 --> 24:57.353
She saves you.
She saves you

24:57.387 --> 24:59.739
- and she turns you into a gladiator,
a soldier... - 752... 752...

24:59.790 --> 25:01.390
And then we live and die for her.

25:01.425 --> 25:03.142
- We are blindly loyal.
- 752...

25:03.176 --> 25:05.411
- No questions asked, morals
be damned, because... - 752...

25:05.445 --> 25:08.597
- She loves us, and this becomes
who we are...gladiators. - 752...

25:08.615 --> 25:10.683
- And it's amazing, and it's
wonderful... - 752...

25:10.717 --> 25:12.318
And it ruins everything.

25:12.369 --> 25:14.403
- 752...
- So...

25:14.437 --> 25:17.423
- 752, 752...
- I went into David's safe and I...

25:17.457 --> 25:20.025
stole the cytron card.

25:20.860 --> 25:23.895
- 752... - And now he'll never
love me like that again.

25:23.930 --> 25:26.314
(Breathing heavily) (Exhales)

25:30.869 --> 25:32.737

25:33.805 --> 25:36.407
- 752...
- Yeah.

25:36.441 --> 25:38.659
- 752... - If I had to
make a choice like that

25:38.677 --> 25:41.095
- 751 more times...
- 752...

25:41.129 --> 25:42.847
(Clicks tongue) I'd probably be
right where you are, buddy.

25:42.881 --> 25:47.735

26:00.181 --> 26:03.183
Hey! Oh, yeah!

26:04.669 --> 26:07.604
(Gasps) Hey there, little guy.
(Giggles)

26:07.639 --> 26:09.907
Do you have your daddy's eyes?

26:09.941 --> 26:11.725
I think you do have your daddy's eyes.
(Kim sighs)

26:11.743 --> 26:14.728
"Yes, I do. Yes, I do."

26:14.762 --> 26:17.063
You didn't tell me that we
were expecting company.

26:17.081 --> 26:19.332
- I would have made you clean up.
- I guess I forgot.

26:19.350 --> 26:21.318
(Gasps)

26:21.369 --> 26:23.270
A wife? A frickin' kid?
Were you not there

26:23.304 --> 26:25.122
- when Crosby said no family?
- It doesn't affect my work.

26:25.156 --> 26:26.740
You're delusional.
You're dreaming.

26:26.774 --> 26:28.192
You need to fix it.
You need to take care of it.

26:28.226 --> 26:29.977
As in, get rid of them.
I know.

26:30.011 --> 26:31.628
Or it'll be taken care of for you.

26:31.663 --> 26:33.947
I know. I will.
No take-backs, spin.

26:33.982 --> 26:36.116
No outs.

26:36.150 --> 26:39.286
(Rustling and clattering)

26:39.320 --> 26:41.338
What's going on?

26:41.389 --> 26:42.973
Oh... we need to get
out of here.

26:43.024 --> 26:44.992
What?
Uh... uh...

26:45.026 --> 26:46.627
Just for a while,
maybe a year or two,

26:46.661 --> 26:48.228
until it's safe
for us to come back.

26:48.262 --> 26:50.881
Safe for us to come back?
What...

26:50.915 --> 26:52.266
(Clicks)

26:53.700 --> 26:55.768
- Why are there are guns
in our piano? - Uh...

26:55.802 --> 26:57.670
- Please tell me that this is
not a drug thing. - It's not drugs.

26:57.704 --> 26:59.255
Then what is it?
What are you involved in? (Keys jangle)

27:00.189 --> 27:01.422
- I'll explain later.
- No, you'll explain now!

27:01.457 --> 27:02.657
- I can't.
- Honey...

27:02.691 --> 27:04.108
I can't!

27:05.244 --> 27:07.912
Look.
I need to go to the bank.

27:07.930 --> 27:09.347
Go upstairs.
Pack a bag.

27:09.365 --> 27:10.798
When I come back, we're all
gonna get in the car

27:10.833 --> 27:11.966
and we're gonna go.

27:12.017 --> 27:13.568
Okay? I know it sounds crazy,

27:13.619 --> 27:15.537
but you just have to trust me.

27:15.571 --> 27:18.389
Okay? Hmm?
Do you trust me?

27:19.358 --> 27:20.558
Yeah.

27:20.593 --> 27:22.277
Good.

27:22.311 --> 27:24.695
(Inhales sharply and kisses)

27:24.713 --> 27:26.798
- I'll be back before you know it.
- Mm.

27:28.784 --> 27:30.134

27:31.437 --> 27:33.838

27:33.873 --> 27:35.507
(Closes door)

27:41.697 --> 27:43.031
(Keys jangle)

27:48.003 --> 27:49.921
(Loud clang)
No! No! No!

27:51.823 --> 27:54.325
Let me out of here!
Let me talk to command, please!

27:54.343 --> 27:55.977
Let me out!
(Gate slams)

27:56.011 --> 27:57.428
(Huck) Let me out of here!

27:57.463 --> 27:59.214
Let me... let me out of here!

27:59.265 --> 28:01.382
I just need to talk to command!

28:01.433 --> 28:04.552
Let me out of here!
Let me out of here!

28:04.620 --> 28:06.321
Let me out of here!

28:14.093 --> 28:16.762
752, 752, 752, 752...

28:16.796 --> 28:19.097
752.
(Breathes heavily)

28:19.132 --> 28:20.082
752.

28:20.133 --> 28:22.885
- 752, 752...
- I'm a talker.

28:22.919 --> 28:24.553
- It's what I do. I talk.
- 752...

28:24.587 --> 28:27.372
Since I was a kid, I can talk
myself in or out of anything...

28:27.407 --> 28:29.541
- 752, 752... - Bedtime, homework,
curfew. It's how I sold cars,

28:29.575 --> 28:32.211
- sailed through law school, how I
got clients and get girls. - 752...

28:33.245 --> 28:36.013
Hell, it almost landed me
in jail if it wasn't for Liv...

28:36.047 --> 28:37.982
- 752...
- But you're not a talker.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.518
- 752, 752... - You're action man.
So I can only imagine what you've seen,

28:40.552 --> 28:42.219
- what you've done, what you've
had done to you. - 752...

28:42.237 --> 28:43.855
And I have to imagine,
because you're not just

28:43.889 --> 28:45.506
a man of few words, but the
fewest words possible...

28:45.541 --> 28:47.458
- So I fill in the blanks. We all do.
- 752...

28:47.476 --> 28:50.912
- So I don't know what to say. I...
- 752... 752...

28:50.946 --> 28:52.797
Don't know how
to get through to you.

28:52.831 --> 28:55.650
- 752, 752...
- Me, the man who talks.

28:55.684 --> 28:58.202
- 752, 752, 752... - Some of that's
on you for always being so closed-up,

28:58.236 --> 28:59.670
- but way more it's on me.
- 752...

28:59.705 --> 29:04.425
- 'Cause all my talk,
and all that game...- 752, 752...

29:04.476 --> 29:06.694
- Seems like kids' stuff compared
to who you are... - 752...

29:06.745 --> 29:08.462
- What you've been.
- 752...

29:09.297 --> 29:11.214
Like, I've spent my whole life
trying to get out of homework

29:11.249 --> 29:14.134
while you've lived the life
of a warrior, of a man.

29:14.168 --> 29:16.970
- 752, 752...
- A real-deal gladiator.

29:17.004 --> 29:20.490
- 752... - So I have no
idea what to say here!

29:20.525 --> 29:23.160
(Breathing unevenly)
...Fifty...

29:23.194 --> 29:25.379
(Uneven breathing continues)

29:26.330 --> 29:28.831
Because you make me realize
pretty much every day,

29:28.865 --> 29:30.716
and especially right now...

29:36.189 --> 29:39.458
That all I've ever been...

29:39.493 --> 29:42.645
All I am, all I've ever been...

29:42.679 --> 29:44.130
was talk.

29:46.099 --> 29:48.283
(Exhales)
So I'll just sit here.

29:50.003 --> 29:51.687
And I won't run my mouth
with a lot of noise

29:51.722 --> 29:53.522
that's not worthy.

29:57.059 --> 29:59.427
So you be as full-on crazy
as you want

29:59.462 --> 30:01.813
for as long as you need,
and I'm gonna be here,

30:01.847 --> 30:03.215
right here with you.

30:05.418 --> 30:07.018
(Breathing unevenly)

30:07.053 --> 30:08.153
(Exhales)

30:08.187 --> 30:11.105
752... 752...

30:11.123 --> 30:13.725
752... 752...

30:14.476 --> 30:17.862
- 752... 752...
- Yeah. We got time.

30:17.913 --> 30:19.080
752...

30:19.114 --> 30:24.969
752, 752, 752, 752...

30:25.003 --> 30:27.571
(Gate opens)
(Breathing heavily)

30:27.606 --> 30:29.624
Private, do you know who I am?

30:29.658 --> 30:31.025
- Yes, sir.
- Do you know where you are?

30:31.059 --> 30:32.693
- Yes.
- Do you have a wife and child?

30:32.711 --> 30:34.345
Yes, sir.

30:34.379 --> 30:35.780
Close it up.

30:35.814 --> 30:37.731
Aah!

30:37.749 --> 30:39.767
- Do you have a wife and child?
- Let me out of here!

30:39.801 --> 30:42.687
- Do you have a wife and child?!
- Yes!

30:45.307 --> 30:46.657
Do you have a wife and child?

30:46.692 --> 30:48.709
(Weakly) Yes.

30:51.947 --> 30:53.414
Do you have a wife and child?

30:53.448 --> 30:55.900
Yes. Yes!

30:55.951 --> 30:57.651
(Slams pan) Yes!

30:58.869 --> 31:00.870
(Clatters)
Two months this time.

31:00.905 --> 31:02.622
(Chuckles) Two...
Someone tell a joke?

31:02.640 --> 31:04.073
No, I just... two months?

31:04.108 --> 31:05.441
This comes straight
from command.

31:05.493 --> 31:06.793
Command seen the state he's in?

31:06.827 --> 31:08.595
- I have orders. Now so do you.
- Copy that.

31:08.629 --> 31:10.096
- Two months.
- Two months.

31:13.751 --> 31:16.619
(Huck) Yes. Yes. Yes!
Yes! Yes! (Door closes)

31:16.654 --> 31:21.441
Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes! Yes!

31:21.475 --> 31:23.493
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

31:24.127 --> 31:25.561
She was brought in
with a concussion

31:25.595 --> 31:27.163
and scrapes and bruises
at 0200 hours.

31:27.197 --> 31:28.931
The president arrived
at the hospital

31:28.965 --> 31:31.000
shortly after 0300 hours
and he hasn't left the wing.

31:31.034 --> 31:33.135
You mean he hasn't left her side.

31:33.186 --> 31:35.988
He hasn't left yet, but Ms. Pope
is scheduled to be discharged

31:36.006 --> 31:37.556
within the next half hour.

31:37.591 --> 31:39.408
(Breathes sharply)

31:40.159 --> 31:42.010
He should be home
shortly, ma'am.

31:43.563 --> 31:45.163
Thank you, Hal.

31:45.198 --> 31:47.365
I truly appreciate everything
you've done for me.

31:47.400 --> 31:48.567
Ma'am.

31:50.937 --> 31:52.971
(Door opens and closes)

31:57.409 --> 31:59.144
(Door opens)

31:59.178 --> 32:00.779
(Clears throat)

32:00.813 --> 32:02.981
The nurse said you can
wear these home.

32:03.015 --> 32:04.566
You can go.

32:05.017 --> 32:06.451
- You don't dismiss me.
- I don't want to talk to you.

32:06.485 --> 32:07.919
I'm never gonna be
ready to talk to you.

32:07.953 --> 32:09.354
- So why don't you just...
- I love you.

32:09.388 --> 32:11.522
Stop saying that!
You're having me followed, watched.

32:11.540 --> 32:13.174
There are cameras
in my apartment.

32:13.225 --> 32:16.244
- That's not love!
- You have to understand.

32:16.578 --> 32:19.997
Defiance changed everything
for me... everything.

32:20.031 --> 32:22.016
You think it didn't change me?

32:22.050 --> 32:23.917
You think it was easy, simple?

32:23.952 --> 32:26.387
I went against everything
I believed in. For you.

32:26.438 --> 32:28.572
I did that for you.
Everything was for you.

32:28.606 --> 32:30.708
And... you walked away.
You didn't even let me explain.

32:30.742 --> 32:32.026
I thought you believed in me.

32:32.060 --> 32:33.777
I thought you thought
I was good enough.

32:34.395 --> 32:35.779
I thought...
I thought you saw me.

32:35.813 --> 32:37.731
I did see you.
I do see you.

32:37.765 --> 32:40.350
No, you didn't.
You don't.

32:40.384 --> 32:42.702
I wanted to win this on my own.

32:42.737 --> 32:44.638
I wanted to win it
because I deserved it.

32:44.672 --> 32:46.339
I wanted to win it
because I had

32:46.374 --> 32:48.925
the will of the people
behind me.

32:48.959 --> 32:52.362
I wanted to own
becoming president

32:52.396 --> 32:54.314
of the United States of America.

32:54.348 --> 32:55.682
I didn't want it handed to me.

32:55.716 --> 32:57.400
I didn't want you
fixing it for me.

32:57.434 --> 32:58.585
That's what you do, Livvie.

32:58.619 --> 33:00.270
You handle.
You fix.

33:00.304 --> 33:03.506
- I was trying to help...
- You don't fix me!

33:03.524 --> 33:05.692
You don't handle me!

33:06.426 --> 33:08.194
That is not love.

33:08.228 --> 33:09.462
That's control.

33:09.496 --> 33:11.497
I asked you to be a team.

33:11.531 --> 33:13.282
We should have been a team.
It should have been you and me,

33:13.317 --> 33:15.685
and instead it was you
and Verna and Cyrus

33:15.719 --> 33:18.104
and Hollis and Mellie.

33:18.188 --> 33:21.007
I am... <i>angry</i>

33:21.058 --> 33:23.109
that you fixed the election,
but I'm even angrier

33:23.160 --> 33:25.594
that you thought
you were fixing me.

33:25.629 --> 33:27.262
You're angry.
Then why are you here?

33:27.280 --> 33:28.798
I'm here because I love you.

33:28.832 --> 33:30.266
And how does that change
anything that has happened?

33:30.600 --> 33:32.551
- What's the point?!
- Do you still love me?

33:34.170 --> 33:35.871
Do you?

33:35.905 --> 33:37.690
Still love me?

33:43.245 --> 33:44.629
Does it matter?

33:45.781 --> 33:47.632
It matters.

33:47.666 --> 33:49.050
Do you still love me?

33:49.085 --> 33:51.186
It's a yes or no question.

33:53.205 --> 33:54.773
Olivia...

33:55.808 --> 33:57.042
I do.

33:59.761 --> 34:01.378
But I can't do this anymore.

34:01.430 --> 34:02.596
- Wait. Wait.
- Fitz...

34:02.614 --> 34:05.332
Wait. Just wait.
Just wait one minute.

34:08.786 --> 34:11.138
This past year...

34:12.858 --> 34:16.543
I have learned only one thing.

34:18.045 --> 34:21.514
That I cannot exist
without you.

34:21.550 --> 34:24.185
That I cannot breathe...

34:24.219 --> 34:26.786
without you.

34:26.822 --> 34:29.090
That the man...

34:29.123 --> 34:32.426
I am without you is...

34:37.114 --> 34:38.916
I'm nothing.

34:41.202 --> 34:43.637
I'm nothing.

34:43.670 --> 34:46.907
And you are everything.

34:46.942 --> 34:49.793
And I need you to give
me another chance.

34:51.446 --> 34:54.281
I demand another chance.

34:55.417 --> 34:58.302
We're worth another chance.

35:03.225 --> 35:05.893
(Inhales sharply)

35:07.729 --> 35:10.397
(Panting)

35:10.432 --> 35:13.601
(Panting)

35:15.070 --> 35:17.404
You hurt me!
(Panting)

35:17.439 --> 35:19.773
I'm so sorry!

35:19.807 --> 35:22.576
(Crying) No!
No! I...

35:23.862 --> 35:25.145
I can't.

35:25.163 --> 35:28.165
I just... I can't.

35:29.501 --> 35:31.418
(Door slams)

35:44.666 --> 35:46.450
(Indistinct conversations)

35:46.485 --> 35:48.235
(Lowered voice) I think
we're good, except for the...

35:48.269 --> 35:49.870
(Continues indistinctly
in lowered voice) Okay.

35:49.905 --> 35:52.023
What's this?
(Gasps and exhales)

35:52.057 --> 35:52.574
(Normal voice) Can you all

35:52.608 --> 35:55.059
give the president
and me a moment, please?

35:56.578 --> 35:58.446
(Door closes)

35:59.481 --> 36:00.598
(Inhales) (Door closes)

36:00.632 --> 36:01.866
I'm leaving.

36:01.900 --> 36:04.218
I didn't realize you
had a trip scheduled.

36:04.252 --> 36:05.786
I don't.

36:05.821 --> 36:07.071
I'm leaving <i>you.</i>

36:07.106 --> 36:08.889
I'm moving across the
street into Blair house.

36:08.907 --> 36:10.491
Don't worry.
We'll take the tunnels.

36:10.509 --> 36:11.876
No one will see us. No one even
needs to know what's happening.

36:12.310 --> 36:13.561
And we can keep it quiet
from the press.

36:13.695 --> 36:14.828
But I am leaving you.

36:14.863 --> 36:16.230
And by the way,
I'm taking Teddy.

36:16.264 --> 36:17.565
A baby needs to be
with its mother.

36:17.599 --> 36:18.933
You're not taking my son.

36:19.767 --> 36:23.186
You want to be very careful
how you use this time, Fitz.

36:23.220 --> 36:24.504
And what the hell
does that mean?

36:24.538 --> 36:26.256
It means you should
stop fighting me

36:26.307 --> 36:27.807
and consider using
this time to think.

36:27.825 --> 36:29.726
See, I'm keeping it quiet for now,

36:29.760 --> 36:31.294
but there's a clock on that.

36:31.328 --> 36:33.096
You need a little time to
figure out what you want to do,

36:33.130 --> 36:35.949
you need a little time to
figure out if you can behave,

36:35.983 --> 36:38.184
but I have had enough.

36:38.219 --> 36:40.286
You want to shack up
with Olivia Pope, fine.

36:40.354 --> 36:43.156
Have at her.
But the clock is ticking.

36:44.090 --> 36:46.308
And when the alarm rings,
I will be standing

36:46.343 --> 36:49.261
on the front lawn of Blair house
holding a press conference discussing

36:49.296 --> 36:50.930
my philandering husband
who can't keep his pants zipped

36:50.964 --> 36:52.848
and the whore who has him on a leash.

36:52.882 --> 36:54.383
I'm done.

36:54.417 --> 36:56.485
Life as you know it is over.

36:59.472 --> 37:01.640
Okay.
Ohh...

37:03.059 --> 37:05.010
(Teddy fusses)

37:05.028 --> 37:08.213
I hope you make the right
decision, Fitz. I do.

37:08.248 --> 37:11.684
I hope you choose family.

37:12.118 --> 37:13.585
Because good luck
getting reelected

37:13.619 --> 37:15.704
once I start talking.

37:21.094 --> 37:24.629
(Door opens and closes)

37:24.664 --> 37:27.249
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

37:27.283 --> 37:29.084
(Cell phone rings)

37:29.935 --> 37:31.452
(Sighs) You should get more sleep.

37:31.486 --> 37:33.371
I need you to find out
what kind of relationship

37:33.405 --> 37:35.139
Jake Ballard has
with Olivia Pope.

37:35.173 --> 37:36.858
(Mouth full) You know
I killed a king once?

37:36.892 --> 37:39.210
A real one.
With a crown and everything.

37:39.244 --> 37:40.761
- Those were the days.
- Charlie...

37:40.812 --> 37:42.396
He brought her to a hospital
in the middle of the night

37:42.431 --> 37:43.948
wearing his shirt.

37:43.982 --> 37:45.383
You can imagine what kind
of relationship that must be.

37:46.117 --> 37:47.817
I don't want to imagine.
I want proof. Hard proof.

37:47.835 --> 37:49.136
Something I can use.

37:49.170 --> 37:51.438
I've killed kings, chief.
Consider it done.

37:51.489 --> 37:52.539
(Sighs) (Phone beeps)

37:55.810 --> 37:57.144
Where are we?

37:57.178 --> 37:58.645
She barely got away
with her life.

37:58.680 --> 38:00.063
Albatross knows
she's after him.

38:00.298 --> 38:01.731
- Good.
- Good?

38:01.766 --> 38:03.083
Well, she's got him rattled.

38:03.117 --> 38:04.601
He'll have to surface
to get her out of the way.

38:04.635 --> 38:06.136
We need him to surface.

38:06.154 --> 38:07.754
You want to use
Olivia Pope as bait?

38:07.789 --> 38:10.040
I want albatross.
Everything else is irrelevant.

38:10.074 --> 38:12.292
(Exhales) I may need out, sir.

38:14.712 --> 38:16.113
Excuse me?

38:16.147 --> 38:18.815
I'd like you to reassign
this mission to someone else.

38:18.850 --> 38:20.783
I'm feeling there's
a conflict of interest here.

38:20.802 --> 38:22.435
Because of your relationship
with the president?

38:23.654 --> 38:24.805
Yes.

38:24.839 --> 38:26.422
(Sighs)

38:26.440 --> 38:29.192
Remember who we are,
captain Ballard.

38:29.227 --> 38:31.511
There's no such thing as out.

38:42.972 --> 38:44.373
Do you have a wife and son?

38:44.407 --> 38:47.976
(Breathing unevenly)

38:49.312 --> 38:52.197
<i>Do you</i> have a wife and son?

38:56.403 --> 38:57.870
(Uneven breathing continues)

38:59.205 --> 39:00.472
No.

39:02.859 --> 39:04.076
(Breathing unevenly)

39:07.113 --> 39:08.347
No, I don't.

39:12.085 --> 39:13.702
Well, I hope you're
as excited as we are

39:13.736 --> 39:15.521
to have you back in the fold,

39:15.555 --> 39:17.373
- be a part of our team again.
- I am.

39:17.407 --> 39:20.392
Good news is, we've already
lined up your next assignment.

39:20.443 --> 39:22.378
Think you're up to it?

39:23.730 --> 39:25.864
(Man groaning, muffled)

39:25.899 --> 39:28.450
No! No! No!

39:28.484 --> 39:30.803
No!
(Muffled protesting)

39:30.837 --> 39:32.171
No!
(Sobbing)

39:32.222 --> 39:33.806
Oh, no! No!

39:33.857 --> 39:35.791
(Muffled sobbing)

39:35.825 --> 39:38.093
No! No!
Don't hurt me!

39:40.011 --> 39:42.529
(Muffled sobbing)
(Charlie) Time's up, spin.

39:42.563 --> 39:44.598
We gave you a test and you failed.
Give me that.

39:44.599 --> 39:47.352
(Man) Aah! (Screaming)

39:48.086 --> 39:50.221
Command ordered me to kill you.
(Gun cocks)

39:50.255 --> 39:53.107
(Man shouting, muffled)

39:54.775 --> 39:56.742
(Panting) You're dead.

39:56.776 --> 39:57.828
You're a ghost.

39:58.379 --> 39:59.762
You can't contact
anyone you know.

39:59.797 --> 40:01.114
You talk to your wife,
I'll kill her.

40:01.148 --> 40:02.282
I'll shoot her in the head

40:02.316 --> 40:03.449
and then I'll shoot
your little son!

40:03.484 --> 40:05.952
So run! Now!
Before I change my mind!

40:05.986 --> 40:08.021
(Rapid footsteps departing)
(Panting)

40:08.055 --> 40:10.907
(Man whimpering) (Slaps back)

40:12.192 --> 40:13.609
What happened?

40:13.660 --> 40:15.078
The mission was accomplished,
sir, but unfortunately

40:15.129 --> 40:16.929
there was a hiccup.

40:16.964 --> 40:18.565
The subject was not as
rehabilitated as we'd hoped.

40:18.599 --> 40:21.084
- And you took care of him?
- Yes, sir. Personally.

40:21.118 --> 40:22.852
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

40:23.204 --> 40:25.788
(Sighs) Shame.
That young man had potential.

40:29.308 --> 40:31.293
- Where is he?
(Abby) - Are you okay?

40:31.327 --> 40:33.495
- I'm fine.
- He's in there.

40:33.546 --> 40:38.600
(Huck) 752... 752...
752... 752... 752...

40:38.635 --> 40:41.003
752... 752...

40:41.037 --> 40:43.689
752... 752...

40:43.723 --> 40:45.374
Seven...

40:45.408 --> 40:47.492
Five... two.

40:47.527 --> 40:50.362
(Breathing unevenly)
Seven... five... two.

40:50.396 --> 40:52.998
752.

40:53.032 --> 40:54.666
752.

40:54.701 --> 40:56.234
752.

40:56.269 --> 40:58.704
(Pants) 752...

40:58.738 --> 41:00.505
752...

41:00.539 --> 41:03.075
752... 752...

41:03.109 --> 41:06.812
752... 752...

41:06.846 --> 41:08.847
752...

41:08.865 --> 41:10.549
752...

41:10.583 --> 41:12.868
752... 752...

41:14.102 --> 41:15.085
Huck.

41:15.120 --> 41:16.971
752...

41:17.005 --> 41:18.589
752...

41:18.623 --> 41:19.640
752...

41:19.674 --> 41:20.941
Huck.

41:20.992 --> 41:25.529
752, 752... 752...

41:25.563 --> 41:26.664
Seven...

41:26.698 --> 41:29.600
(Breathing unevenly)

41:31.803 --> 41:33.604
(Exhales)

41:35.290 --> 41:36.540
(Breathing settles)

41:41.145 --> 41:42.662
I have to admit,
I'm not a person

41:42.696 --> 41:45.598
who gives change to homeless
guys on the Metro.

41:45.633 --> 41:48.618
I don't do that.
I don't stop, which is...

41:48.652 --> 41:50.203
I don't stop,
but I stopped for you.

41:50.237 --> 41:51.938
You made me stop.

41:51.972 --> 41:53.640
It was your eyes.

41:53.674 --> 41:55.591
You had...

41:55.609 --> 41:59.229
the saddest eyes.

41:59.263 --> 42:01.464
They were sadder than mine.

42:07.837 --> 42:11.206
The thing is, Huck, you
always say that I saved you.

42:11.241 --> 42:14.243
That's not true.
It's not even close to true.

42:14.277 --> 42:19.782
I had been all alone
for... a very long time.

42:19.816 --> 42:21.650
There are moments,

42:21.685 --> 42:25.020
people who...

42:25.055 --> 42:27.289
somehow they convince
me that I'm wrong.

42:27.324 --> 42:28.907
That I'm not alone.

42:28.942 --> 42:32.044
That I have something to...

42:33.078 --> 42:34.762
People let you down.

42:34.796 --> 42:36.314
People hurt you.

42:36.365 --> 42:38.933
People lie.

42:38.968 --> 42:41.285
I'm all alone,

42:41.320 --> 42:43.304
except for you.

42:43.539 --> 42:46.490
Harrison and Abby and Quinn are...

42:47.025 --> 42:50.310
We take care of them.
We love them.

42:50.328 --> 42:52.246
But they don't live on the
dark side of the moon.

42:52.680 --> 42:55.082
They're different.
So, Huck,

42:55.116 --> 42:57.634
I need you to snap out of this.
Whatever this is,

42:57.685 --> 43:00.987
whatever happened to you,
you have to come back to me.

43:01.005 --> 43:02.973
(Voice breaking) I need you.

43:03.057 --> 43:04.891
You are all I have.

43:04.909 --> 43:07.511
You are everything.

43:07.545 --> 43:10.747
Because I didn't save you
in that Metro station.

43:10.782 --> 43:12.999
You saved me. (Sobs)

43:15.470 --> 43:17.871
(Sniffles twice)

43:21.943 --> 43:25.345
(Breath quavering)

43:25.379 --> 43:27.080
(Exhales)

43:27.898 --> 43:30.082
I think I used to have a family.
(Gasps)

43:32.352 --> 43:34.487
(Voice breaking) But I don't
remember if they were real,

43:34.521 --> 43:37.490
or if I imagined them.

43:40.761 --> 43:42.478
What do you think?

43:42.512 --> 43:43.946
(Sobbing)

43:43.997 --> 43:45.848
I think they were real!

43:45.882 --> 43:47.984
Then they were real.

43:48.018 --> 43:50.603
Then you had a family.

43:52.105 --> 43:54.490
(Sobbing) They were real!

43:54.541 --> 43:55.975
They were.

43:58.629 --> 44:01.714
(Breathing unevenly)

44:02.748 --> 44:04.699
I did terrible things.

44:04.734 --> 44:09.654
We all do terrible things.

44:09.688 --> 44:12.340
(Whimpering softly)

44:12.375 --> 44:15.477
(Crying)

44:17.063 --> 44:18.713
(Sighs)

44:26.772 --> 44:28.406
(Harrison)
Now we'll never know.

44:28.441 --> 44:30.725
(Abby) Never know what?

44:30.776 --> 44:32.060
What "752" means.

44:41.270 --> 44:43.488
(Train approaching)

44:43.522 --> 44:46.992
(Indistinct conversations)

44:49.845 --> 44:51.162
(Doors hiss)

44:57.452 --> 44:58.786
(Kim) Javi!

44:58.820 --> 45:01.038
Javi, come here.

45:01.673 --> 45:03.490
It's cold outside.

45:03.525 --> 45:05.775
I want a dollar for the man.

45:05.794 --> 45:09.479
- Honey, we don't have...
- Mommy, he looks hungry.

45:11.616 --> 45:13.349
You come right back.

45:17.438 --> 45:18.705
Here.

45:46.217 --> 45:48.185
