<i>Last week...
This jerk didn't care about the... </i>

01:01.300 --> 01:02.880
<i>...Ten team at all in the beginning. </i>

01:02.880 --> 01:07.100
<i>He wants us to find the hidden picture while he goes into hiding. </i>

01:07.100 --> 01:10.490
<i>From the alibis of the people who were at the motel that night... </i>

01:10.490 --> 01:13.410
<i>The one person whose alibi I never got. </i>

01:13.410 --> 01:17.020
<i>No, the person who didn't even try to give an alibi... </i>

01:17.020 --> 01:18.450
<i>Director Yeo... </i>

01:18.450 --> 01:21.220
<i>I couldn't confirm his alibi for the day before the incident. </i>

01:21.220 --> 01:22.900
<i>The best camouflage. </i>

01:22.900 --> 01:24.800
<i>A murderer who kills people... </i>

01:24.800 --> 01:28.650
<i>Disguises himself as a Detective who chases after murderers... </i>

01:28.650 --> 01:31.380
<i>The three of you need to come with me. </i>

01:31.380 --> 01:34.380
<i>How much do you think you know about Yeo Ji Hoon? </i>

01:34.380 --> 01:35.790
<i>What is this? </i>

01:35.790 --> 01:40.140
<i>This is a video taken by Kim Min Hee,
a victim from the 101 incident. </i>

01:40.140 --> 01:42.840
<i>You know who that is, don't you?
That person. </i>

01:51.330 --> 01:55.130
[Episode 2]

02:05.010 --> 02:06.240
<i>What do you think? </i>

02:06.240 --> 02:09.310
<i>When you work together,
you get a feeling! </i>

02:09.770 --> 02:12.900
<i>"Oh! This guy is kind of weird." </i>

02:12.900 --> 02:15.600
<i>"He must be crazy." </i>

02:15.600 --> 02:18.670
What are you doing?!
Why?!

02:25.900 --> 02:28.810
<i>How much do you think you know about Yeo Ji Hoon? </i>

02:30.270 --> 02:33.160
Do you really think you can read through everyone's lies?

02:34.870 --> 02:37.080
Whether it's good or bad...

02:38.200 --> 02:40.920
If there is something that someone wants to hide...

02:40.920 --> 02:43.480
They could be wearing a very, thick mask.

02:44.970 --> 02:47.170
Try taking it off later.

02:47.170 --> 02:51.060
See what kind of faces lie behind the masks.

02:51.060 --> 02:52.970
<i>Have you ever been curious? </i>

02:52.970 --> 02:56.560
<i>Why Yeo Ji Hoon would've chosen you on his Ten team? </i>

02:56.560 --> 02:59.350
You wanted to knock him out.

02:59.350 --> 03:02.220
You wanted to catch him,
so I let you go first.

03:03.970 --> 03:05.880
Did you actually beat him up?

03:05.880 --> 03:07.560
Well... I...

03:08.320 --> 03:12.520
I just look like this on the outside.

03:12.520 --> 03:16.280
But that bastard is broken on the inside.

03:17.980 --> 03:21.360
Good work today...
Senior.

03:29.210 --> 03:30.200
You punk.

03:36.470 --> 03:38.910
I have someone bothering the hell out of me.

03:40.080 --> 03:44.040
When you meet him,
can you beat him up for me?

03:50.960 --> 03:53.620
If he went to the victim's house on the day before the incident...

03:54.570 --> 03:58.180
The next day, at the motel...
at the autopsy...

03:59.370 --> 04:02.090
He was lying to us the entire time.

04:04.320 --> 04:06.980
Yeo Ji Hoon, you bastard.
Who are you?

04:08.260 --> 04:11.610
Yeh Ri, say something!

04:11.610 --> 04:14.180
You said you could read through people's lies!

04:15.130 --> 04:18.100
Was the Director acting this whole time?

04:18.870 --> 04:19.760
No, right?

04:20.750 --> 04:22.010
I'm sorry.

04:22.810 --> 04:24.410
I don't know either.

04:25.450 --> 04:27.310
I don't want to admit it either.

04:27.310 --> 04:33.030
You can't ignore the fact that all the F events point to him.

04:34.630 --> 04:36.860
But the crazy thing is...
No-

04:38.610 --> 04:40.170
The scary thing is...

04:42.330 --> 04:45.580
I don't know what kind of person Yeo Ji Hoon is anymore.

04:45.580 --> 04:48.600
If the Yeo Ji Hoon I know is Yeo Ji Hoon...

04:50.460 --> 04:52.930
Is there anyone here that knows Yeo Ji Hoon really well?

04:54.610 --> 04:55.540
There isn't.

05:00.710 --> 05:02.050
Detective Baek.

05:03.820 --> 05:04.970
Yeh Ri.

05:06.310 --> 05:07.980
I think I know now.

05:09.100 --> 05:13.120
Why the Director picked a useless guy like me to be on this team.

05:15.870 --> 05:18.770
I saw the Director's records of past psychiatric treatment.

05:20.240 --> 05:23.420
Couldn't sleep without sleeping pills or alcohol...

05:25.640 --> 05:28.820
He was a person who couldn't live without his anger management pills.

05:30.400 --> 05:34.590
I know one other person like the Director.

05:39.870 --> 05:40.930
My father.

05:45.210 --> 05:49.620
Someone that lost a loved one to a murderer.

05:52.020 --> 05:54.730
I think the Director wanted me to understand him.

05:55.720 --> 06:00.910
At the very moment they started to doubt themselves...

06:00.910 --> 06:03.420
Someone who could listen to their side.

06:03.420 --> 06:05.420
Someone who could understand them.

06:06.850 --> 06:11.740
That video could've been a trap set by F.

06:12.740 --> 06:14.810
And about him putting on an act...

06:14.810 --> 06:18.290
There could've been other matters we don't understand.

06:20.720 --> 06:21.650
Sure...

06:23.740 --> 06:25.210
Min Ho is right.

06:26.100 --> 06:27.760
Min Ho is right.

06:30.550 --> 06:33.780
F could've been mocking Yeo Ji Hoon this whole time.

06:33.780 --> 06:34.710
Sure!

06:35.570 --> 06:36.480
Sure...

06:36.480 --> 06:41.100
Until we catch the culprit and get his confession, let's not judge.

06:41.820 --> 06:44.220
We've already come this far.
Let's go at it one more time.

06:44.220 --> 06:47.680
Room 101, Kim Min Hee.
Last F case.

06:53.150 --> 06:56.450
Devil

10:48.030 --> 10:51.550
I keep telling those guys to turn off their computer.

11:10.930 --> 11:13.760
Lonely females with no family and no job.

11:13.760 --> 11:17.070
This is the patter F uses when choosing his victims.

11:17.070 --> 11:20.210
The victim not only called 411 but they also called the police.

11:20.210 --> 11:22.500
The Director's phone is now connected.

11:22.500 --> 11:27.280
And as soon as he hung up,
they tracked the phone address.

11:27.280 --> 11:31.660
There are no records of the victim or Director Yeo calling each other before.

11:33.350 --> 11:35.120
Then, that means they didn't know each other.

11:36.140 --> 11:38.580
Unless they hid their presence really well.

11:38.580 --> 11:41.460
Time of entry into the victim's house - 3:46 PM.

11:41.460 --> 11:43.690
Time of exit - 3:59 PM.

11:43.690 --> 11:46.020
He stayed in there for 13 minutes.

11:46.020 --> 11:49.070
He entered similarly as he exited.

11:49.070 --> 11:55.040
Let's say F committed the crime and lured the Director to go there.

11:55.040 --> 11:56.990
He fell into a trap?

11:56.990 --> 12:01.160
Once the investigation started,
it made sense that he was the main suspect.

12:01.160 --> 12:05.740
Perhaps he went into hiding, not to avoid F.

12:05.740 --> 12:08.810
But because he could've realized it was a trap.

12:08.810 --> 12:14.460
So, we're the last hope in catching the real F.

12:14.460 --> 12:16.450
13 minutes...

12:21.030 --> 12:22.850
13 minutes...

12:25.050 --> 12:29.010
What could Yeo Ji Hoon have possibly done in 13 minutes?

12:29.740 --> 12:32.980
What did he see, what did he do...

12:33.890 --> 12:37.590
For him to put on an act the next day?

12:48.600 --> 12:50.410
Who can act?

12:56.700 --> 12:58.480
What are you doing?

12:58.480 --> 12:59.860
It's a bad guy!

12:59.860 --> 13:02.910
Save me!
Please save me!

13:02.910 --> 13:04.340
Why are you doing this?

13:04.340 --> 13:07.950
It's a bad guy!
Save me! Save-

13:46.690 --> 13:50.110
Just one look and you know there was a killing here.

13:50.110 --> 13:52.580
Then, that means they moved the body.

13:52.580 --> 13:56.660
Why that motel? Why did he move the body to Room 101?

13:56.660 --> 14:00.550
That isn't important.
We can ask that when we catch him.

14:02.410 --> 14:05.900
The important thing is when, how.

14:06.780 --> 14:08.690
Who moved it.

14:08.690 --> 14:11.480
He probably did it in the middle of the night to avoid being seen.

14:11.480 --> 14:12.820
To not get caught.

14:15.630 --> 14:16.620
Min Ho.

14:17.720 --> 14:21.420
How many roads to get from the victim's house to the motel?

14:24.320 --> 14:26.540
I'll go collect video camera information.

14:28.020 --> 14:31.070
Yeh Ri, find out details on Kim Min Hee.

14:31.070 --> 14:32.300
Specifically, male relations.

14:32.300 --> 14:33.490
Yes.

14:36.840 --> 14:38.050
It's this way...

14:50.260 --> 14:55.130
This is the same Catholic meeting I saw in Jung Hee Joo's house.

14:56.080 --> 14:58.240
Why was this in Kim Min Hee's house?

15:09.960 --> 15:12.770
7 years ago, Yeo Ji Joon,
Jung Hee Joo, Kim Min Hee...

15:12.770 --> 15:14.890
...were all at the same place.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.650
At Ha Neul...

15:22.830 --> 15:24.190
Should I arrest them?

15:25.450 --> 15:27.930
Leave them alone.
They're the Ten team.

15:27.930 --> 15:31.450
The hounds will catch the running hound anyway.

15:37.380 --> 15:39.040
Detective Nam Yeh Ri?

15:50.590 --> 15:53.470
My teenage daughter was killed.

15:53.470 --> 15:55.470
Yesterday was her birthday.

15:56.360 --> 15:59.180
Even though I've endured it well for this long...

15:59.180 --> 16:02.330
It gets harder when the victim's birthday comes around.

16:03.720 --> 16:06.720
You're here to talk about Sister Kim Min Hee, aren't you?

16:06.720 --> 16:09.270
Ah, yes.

16:09.270 --> 16:12.130
It's this woman.

16:12.130 --> 16:14.230
Ah, yes. I remember her.

16:14.230 --> 16:16.320
This is Sister Kim Min Hee.

16:16.320 --> 16:19.330
She came for a short while in 2004.

16:20.780 --> 16:23.460
She came to look for her sister's murderer.

16:23.460 --> 16:25.160
She wasn't here for long.

16:26.490 --> 16:27.590
By any chance...

16:28.600 --> 16:31.260
Was there a man that Kim Min Hee was close to?

16:31.260 --> 16:35.590
Man? I don't know to that extent...

16:36.860 --> 16:39.960
Well... then...

16:39.960 --> 16:43.820
Do you remember this man next to Jung Hee Joo?

16:43.820 --> 16:46.070
Hee Joo's boyfriend?

16:46.070 --> 16:48.490
Ah, yes! I remember him.

16:49.550 --> 16:51.290
I'm also in this picture.

16:52.670 --> 16:55.460
It was probably winter at that time...

16:55.460 --> 16:57.490
Hee Joo introduced him to us one day.

17:08.540 --> 17:10.160
Who...

17:12.470 --> 17:14.640
This is my boyfriend.

17:18.750 --> 17:23.369
Nice to meet you.
I welcome you on behalf of Ha Neul.

17:23.369 --> 17:25.940
Except if you're a criminal or police.

17:28.950 --> 17:32.110
Unfortunately, I'm a policeman.

17:36.740 --> 17:41.800
He was there to investigate crimes and talked to some people individually.

17:43.440 --> 17:46.680
Ah! Now that I think about it, I remember.

17:47.780 --> 17:50.550
That day, something disgraceful happened.

18:23.830 --> 18:26.920
That Detective should've been more careful.

18:27.740 --> 18:32.090
That was the first time those people saw how their families died.

18:32.890 --> 18:35.270
After all, they only knew that they died...

18:36.540 --> 18:42.570
Do you have any other memory of that Detective and Kim Min Hee?

18:43.510 --> 18:45.000
I'm not sure...

18:45.000 --> 18:48.760
I'm sure we ran into him once or twice after that happened.

18:48.760 --> 18:51.090
Ah! There was one time...

18:51.090 --> 18:53.840
Protect them!
Protect them!

18:53.840 --> 18:58.320
We want the police to go back!
Go back! Go back!

18:58.320 --> 19:03.380
Find the murderers who killed!
Find them! Find them!

19:03.380 --> 19:06.580
What kind of role does this new newly closed case play?

19:06.580 --> 19:09.390
Do you know the number of murder cases before this?

19:09.390 --> 19:11.010
Please say a few words.

19:11.010 --> 19:13.280
Please comment on the close of the case.

19:13.280 --> 19:22.750
The police will try our best to satisfy your needs and solve these cases.

19:22.750 --> 19:25.890
When it already took you this long?!
When will you catch him?!

19:33.880 --> 19:37.390
To the victims' families,
I understand you completely.

19:37.390 --> 19:41.520
However, this behavior is only interfering with our investigations.

19:41.520 --> 19:44.390
You can't catch a criminal with your anger.

19:44.390 --> 19:46.770
We, the police, catch the criminal.

19:46.770 --> 19:50.430
Please keep that in mind and wait back in your homes.

19:50.430 --> 19:51.960
Are you kidding?!

19:59.290 --> 20:04.810
Please catch the criminal that killed my daughter!

20:05.340 --> 20:07.420
- Please...
- Please let go.

20:07.420 --> 20:11.340
I understand your situation so please let go.

20:11.960 --> 20:13.630
Please catch him!

20:13.630 --> 20:15.940
Please let go!

20:26.580 --> 20:28.810
Just because she was a bar girl!

20:28.810 --> 20:33.500
If this happened to your family,
would you close the case like this?

20:37.860 --> 20:41.690
Now that I look back...
She's right here.

20:41.690 --> 20:43.510
Sister Lee Bok Soon.

20:43.510 --> 20:47.750
If it's about Sister Kim Min Hee,
this person would know the most.

20:47.750 --> 20:49.460
Sister Lee Bok Soon?

20:52.240 --> 20:54.320
She lost her daughter to a criminal.

20:54.320 --> 20:56.930
She was a member of Ha Neul.

21:00.650 --> 21:02.580
Thank you for today.

21:02.580 --> 21:04.580
It's no problem.

21:04.580 --> 21:07.030
Oh... but...

21:07.030 --> 21:09.590
With all due respect...

21:09.590 --> 21:13.280
It seems like you normally meet at these kind of places.

21:13.280 --> 21:14.930
Because it's so luxurious?

21:16.030 --> 21:21.370
Once a month, I like to treat them to an expensive meal.

21:21.370 --> 21:23.940
Normally, it's hard to even eat food.

21:23.940 --> 21:26.520
Because for them,
it's hard to even smile.

21:28.030 --> 21:30.710
Ah... yes...

21:30.710 --> 21:33.970
I was at a Victim Support Center 2 years ago.

21:35.660 --> 21:39.490
It looks like I don't understand as much as I thought.

21:39.490 --> 21:41.720
Those thoughts are better.

21:43.510 --> 21:46.230
"I understand.
I understand everything."

21:47.750 --> 21:51.120
To those people, that's the worst thing you can say.

21:55.120 --> 21:59.620
When are we going to have the time to search all these cars?

21:59.620 --> 22:03.060
He's the type to kill and then camouflage himself.

22:03.060 --> 22:04.610
Be nervous.

22:04.610 --> 22:07.170
He's going to drive by the moment you say "Oops!"

22:07.170 --> 22:10.230
Ugh, how many more cameras?

22:25.200 --> 22:28.120
Detective Baek, look at this.

22:30.410 --> 22:32.940
Don't we know this person?

22:33.780 --> 22:35.400
Seo Yoo Rim from the Autopsy.

22:36.090 --> 22:37.290
Who's the driver?

22:39.920 --> 22:42.080
It looks like a man.

22:42.080 --> 22:44.620
They got caught right at 2:40!

22:46.260 --> 22:49.260
Why is the Medical Examiner passing through at this time?

22:49.260 --> 22:50.580
Vehicle number?

22:52.640 --> 22:54.910
04-5287.

22:54.910 --> 22:56.310
It's a rental car!

22:56.310 --> 22:57.850
See when they left.

23:01.460 --> 23:03.230
It caught them leaving.

23:03.230 --> 23:05.890
2:56 AM. 16 minutes later!

23:15.750 --> 23:17.050
Min Ho.

23:18.520 --> 23:20.680
I don't think that's a coincidence.

23:20.680 --> 23:23.270
From there to the victim's house, 3 kilometers.

23:23.270 --> 23:25.700
If the round trip took about 10 minutes...

23:25.700 --> 23:29.440
Perfect timing for them to drag the body.

23:29.440 --> 23:30.430
Then...

23:31.880 --> 23:33.180
Min Ho.

23:33.180 --> 23:35.430
I think we finally caught F.

23:35.430 --> 23:37.760
Call Yeh Ri and search all the car rental companies.

23:37.760 --> 23:39.100
Yes.

23:47.280 --> 23:48.510
Seo Yoo Rim...

24:02.840 --> 24:06.820
Yes, this car was rented from our company.

24:06.820 --> 24:08.940
04-5287

24:08.940 --> 24:10.970
I specifically rented out this car.

24:12.030 --> 24:15.000
Is this the person who rented the car?

24:16.860 --> 24:19.990
Yes, you're right.
It was this woman.

24:21.830 --> 24:23.360
You must have a keen eye.

24:24.550 --> 24:25.920
Did she comes alone?

24:25.920 --> 24:28.230
No. She received the car alone.

24:28.230 --> 24:32.700
But when i saw the car leave, there was a man driving it.

24:32.700 --> 24:34.950
Do you remember the man's face by any chance?

24:36.140 --> 24:37.790
I'm not sure...

24:37.790 --> 24:39.790
He was a younger man.

24:45.370 --> 24:46.590
Was it this man?

24:51.130 --> 24:52.390
Detective Baek!

24:53.760 --> 24:55.860
Yes, you're right!

24:55.860 --> 24:57.460
It was this man.

24:58.590 --> 24:59.860
Are you sure?

25:00.770 --> 25:02.280
Are you sure it was this man?

25:03.450 --> 25:06.720
Yes, I'm positive!
It's this man.

26:19.580 --> 26:21.720
Yeo Ji Hoon,
you son of a bitch.

26:22.570 --> 26:24.510
I'm going to kill you.

26:25.880 --> 26:27.500
Someone once said...

26:27.500 --> 26:29.880
If you kill a person,
you're a murderer.

26:30.780 --> 26:33.360
But if you kill the Devil, you're a hero.

26:35.040 --> 26:36.530
From now on...

26:37.680 --> 26:39.410
Yeo Ji Hoon is...

26:41.210 --> 26:42.680
...a Devil.

26:54.370 --> 26:57.400
A lying Detective who said he'd catch the criminal...

26:57.400 --> 27:00.320
Plus a Medical Examiner that rips apart dead bodies...

27:00.320 --> 27:01.680
Come to think of it.

27:01.680 --> 27:05.310
What a great combo of crime and camouflage!

27:09.730 --> 27:11.260
Where is Yeo Ji Hoon?

27:11.950 --> 27:12.820
Detective Baek.

27:14.960 --> 27:17.420
Where is Yeo Ji Hoon?

27:31.330 --> 27:32.670
What's going on?

27:32.670 --> 27:34.590
Kim Min Hee Murder case.
Suspect, Yeo Ji Hoon.

27:34.590 --> 27:36.060
Accomplice, Seo Yoo Rim.

27:38.980 --> 27:40.430
Here's the evidence.

27:42.740 --> 27:44.490
Let's collaborate on this investigation.

27:51.240 --> 27:53.750
Jung Hee Joo's murder case from 7 years ago...

27:53.750 --> 27:55.310
You quickly stopped the investigations.

27:55.980 --> 27:57.190
Why did you do that?

27:59.520 --> 28:01.730
We've found your daughter's murderer.

28:02.700 --> 28:05.810
I can tell you right now if you wish for me to do so.

28:12.360 --> 28:14.550
I told you not to catch him...

28:16.990 --> 28:18.420
I told you to kill him...

28:21.430 --> 28:23.240
Without anyone knowing...

28:24.800 --> 28:27.160
Kill him quietly...

28:28.430 --> 28:30.480
I gave him my gun.

28:36.970 --> 28:38.810
Who's the criminal?

28:48.470 --> 28:52.690
The man you gave your gun to.

28:59.160 --> 29:05.770
The Kim Min Hee murder case on November 25, 2011 at Hill House motel...

29:05.770 --> 29:08.450
The top suspect is the professor of the Police Training Institute and...

29:08.450 --> 29:10.960
Director of Special Affairs team, Yeo Ji Hoon.

29:10.960 --> 29:14.470
The accomplice has been revealed to be Medical Examiner, Seo Yoo Rim.

29:14.470 --> 29:16.280
Not only this recent crime...

29:16.280 --> 29:18.340
We predict that they were also involved in the 2004, Song Kyung Mi...

29:18.340 --> 29:24.800
Jung Hee Joo and other past tape murder crimes.

29:25.170 --> 29:30.870
Criminal suspect, Seo Yoo Rim was taken into custody Friday at 5 PM.

29:31.310 --> 29:33.770
Relevant evidence has already been secured.

29:33.770 --> 29:37.470
The prime suspect, Yeo Ji Hoon...

29:37.470 --> 29:43.720
...has fled at the moment and will be urgently wanted for open investigation.

29:45.560 --> 29:48.040
Open investigation?!

29:48.040 --> 29:50.040
You bastards!

29:50.040 --> 29:54.010
If people find out that we've had a psycho case on our team for 10 years...

29:54.010 --> 29:57.840
People everywhere will criticize us, you bastards!

29:58.730 --> 30:02.010
Are you saying you'll watch us get chewed alive?!

30:03.070 --> 30:06.940
Stop playing around and take this to the CSI!

30:06.940 --> 30:12.200
Make him come!
Or better yet, kill him first!

30:16.870 --> 30:19.160
You idiot.

30:27.120 --> 30:29.780
We were asked to help.

30:31.310 --> 30:34.580
To find the missing investigation he could never find.

30:35.810 --> 30:37.540
That's how we started.

30:38.900 --> 30:41.080
In the end, this is what it came down to.

30:41.800 --> 30:44.840
I don't understand.
These clues...

30:45.800 --> 30:49.520
He knew they would point to him in the end...

30:49.520 --> 30:51.250
Why would he leave this case to us?

30:52.200 --> 30:53.360
Camouflage.

30:54.230 --> 30:56.280
This guy's specialty, camouflage.

30:57.710 --> 31:01.100
If you don't want to chase after his tail anymore...

31:02.040 --> 31:04.310
You need to know his camouflage pattern.

31:05.730 --> 31:09.780
His first camouflage patter in the "Homeground" case...

31:09.780 --> 31:11.420
Lover camouflage.

31:12.540 --> 31:14.830
In the Dae Jeon Tape case...

31:14.830 --> 31:18.030
Young Detective chasing criminals camouflage.

31:18.860 --> 31:21.490
And... in the Jung Hee Joo case...

31:21.490 --> 31:23.330
A man who lost his loving fiancée...

31:24.200 --> 31:26.900
Heartbroken, family of the victim camouflage.

31:26.900 --> 31:32.870
Lover... Detective...
Family of the victim...

31:32.870 --> 31:35.330
And lastly, in the Kim Min Hee case...

31:35.330 --> 31:37.600
Pay attention to this case.

31:37.600 --> 31:40.480
This leaving no traces behind camouflage...

31:41.800 --> 31:45.580
Don't you think it's weak?

31:46.900 --> 31:48.290
What do you mean it's weak?

31:48.740 --> 31:52.930
The phone alibi, the camera footage...

31:53.840 --> 31:57.280
Exposing his identity at the car rental place...

31:58.680 --> 32:00.540
Rather than having a camouflage,

32:00.540 --> 32:04.440
I say he's cleverly exposing himself in the right loopholes.

32:04.440 --> 32:09.170
Like he wants the world to know he's the criminal.

32:09.170 --> 32:14.300
Are you saying he purposely exposed himself to get caught?

32:14.300 --> 32:16.870
Criminal camouflage?

32:16.870 --> 32:18.120
That's right.

32:19.490 --> 32:20.910
Criminal camouflage.

32:20.910 --> 32:23.120
But, that doesn't make sense.

32:23.120 --> 32:26.340
Maybe the Detective and victim,
but this criminal camouflage-

32:26.340 --> 32:29.690
No. He definitely has a reason.

32:31.030 --> 32:32.390
Be nervous.

32:33.580 --> 32:37.580
Entering into the average person's mind isn't pretty.

32:38.770 --> 32:42.000
What we're dealing with is the Devil.

32:43.250 --> 32:45.990
In order to catch the Devil...

32:45.990 --> 32:50.360
Don't you think we need to think in the Devil's perspective?

32:51.750 --> 32:53.590
Yeo Ji Hoon, you bastard.

32:55.460 --> 32:58.040
Let's see where you end up this time.

34:13.010 --> 34:14.400
<i>Be nervous. </i>

34:15.300 --> 34:19.730
<i>Entering into the average person's mind isn't pretty. </i>

34:20.750 --> 34:23.989
<i>What we're dealing with is the Devil. </i>

34:25.719 --> 34:28.469
<i>In oder to catch the Devil... </i>

34:28.469 --> 34:32.840
<i>Don't you think we need to think in the Devil's perspective? </i>

35:24.840 --> 35:26.640
"2004, that winter."

35:32.390 --> 35:36.340
That winter Jung Hee Joo died?

36:24.110 --> 36:26.100
The only memo not there.

36:30.140 --> 36:32.840
If the victim didn't throw it away...

36:32.840 --> 36:34.880
Yeo Ji Hoon, did you take it?

36:38.250 --> 36:40.520
What could it have been for him to take it?

36:55.630 --> 36:56.820
What?

36:56.820 --> 36:58.120
Senior! What are you doing right now?

36:58.120 --> 37:00.130
I'm doing new research.

37:00.130 --> 37:03.110
You should come here if it's not that important.

37:03.110 --> 37:05.920
I looked through Seo Yoo Rim's computer.

37:05.920 --> 37:08.860
I'm trying to recover recently deleted video files.

37:08.860 --> 37:10.980
She probably made a porn video with Yeo Ji Hoon.

37:10.980 --> 37:13.950
Min Ho, I'm doing something important. Let's hang up.

37:13.950 --> 37:15.290
<i>Wait. </i>

37:15.290 --> 37:18.880
There's a file full of recorded videos taken during the autopsy.

37:19.630 --> 37:22.160
Only the Kim Min Hee autopsy video is missing.

37:23.610 --> 37:25.620
<i>Doesn't something smell fishy? </i>

37:25.620 --> 37:27.810
How long does it take to recover that?

37:27.810 --> 37:29.820
Okay, got it.
I'll be right there.

37:38.050 --> 37:39.720
Yeh Ri.

37:39.720 --> 37:42.790
I found a memo at Kim Min Hee's house.

37:42.790 --> 37:45.100
There's some interesting stuff on it.

37:45.100 --> 37:47.160
"Hee Joo shouldn't have died that way."

37:47.160 --> 37:48.430
"We did wrong."

37:48.430 --> 37:49.640
"I'm sorry."

37:49.640 --> 37:51.630
Definitely Kim Min Hee's handwriting.

37:51.630 --> 37:53.170
What do you think that means?

37:54.640 --> 37:55.940
That's right!

37:55.940 --> 38:00.410
That must mean that Kim Min Hee was an accomplice during that murder.

38:00.410 --> 38:03.700
So, if Seo Yoo Rim was an accomplice for Kim Min Hee's murder.

38:04.840 --> 38:07.960
Yeo Ji Hoon must really be a sick son of a bitch.

38:07.960 --> 38:10.320
When the girl who was his accomplice is no longer useful,

38:10.320 --> 38:12.930
<i>he makes another become an accomplice to her death. </i>

38:39.920 --> 38:42.040
You once told me.

38:42.830 --> 38:45.690
"Don't get close to him."

38:45.690 --> 38:47.160
"It's dangerous."

38:52.070 --> 38:53.690
I guess it was out of jealousy.

38:59.350 --> 39:03.090
Was it after Jung Hee Joo died when he came onto you?

39:03.090 --> 39:06.510
Did he pretend like he was heartbroken over losing his lover?

39:09.280 --> 39:11.290
You'd know better than me.

39:12.410 --> 39:15.200
That all the females around him end up dead.

39:16.310 --> 39:19.200
And that all the girls were accomplices to his murders.

39:22.860 --> 39:24.810
What do you think will happen to you?

39:26.430 --> 39:28.200
Do you think he'll let you live?

39:29.610 --> 39:31.360
Because he loves you this much?

39:33.650 --> 39:35.100
You do know...

39:36.540 --> 39:40.130
That I can read through people's lies.

39:40.130 --> 39:44.570
The Yeo Ji Hoon in this photo is lying.

39:44.570 --> 39:48.270
You're just one of the many women he deceives and victimizes.

39:49.220 --> 39:51.830
He's going to use you in every way he can.

39:51.830 --> 39:53.330
And then get rid of you.

39:55.160 --> 39:56.650
Where is he?

39:57.330 --> 39:58.650
Yeo Ji Hoon.

40:00.220 --> 40:02.190
He'll use me in every way he can?

40:07.120 --> 40:09.540
Do you think I don't know that?

40:13.500 --> 40:19.320
Nam Yeh Ri. You're good at reading through lies.

40:19.920 --> 40:22.280
But when it comes to love...

40:22.280 --> 40:24.760
Your comprehension is very off.

40:39.230 --> 40:40.780
Where did the assistant go?

40:40.780 --> 40:41.670
Good point.

40:41.670 --> 40:43.490
Go back to when the assistant left.

40:43.490 --> 40:44.460
Yes.

41:02.150 --> 41:02.860
Stop!

41:06.410 --> 41:08.250
Min Ho, play that part.

41:08.250 --> 41:09.110
Yes.

41:14.240 --> 41:15.400
What is this?

41:16.140 --> 41:18.040
Looks like she cut her wrist.

41:18.040 --> 41:22.040
It looks like a deep wound that happened not too long ago.

41:22.040 --> 41:24.550
We didn't see this at the autopsy!

41:24.550 --> 41:27.190
They said she died of lung suffocation.

41:30.040 --> 41:31.790
They lied.

41:40.760 --> 41:43.730
She acted natural when there were a lot of eyes on her.

41:43.730 --> 41:48.460
After sending the assistant off,
she pulled the tape off the wrists.

41:48.460 --> 41:50.280
But why?

41:52.640 --> 41:55.060
They played around because it was a corpse.

41:56.890 --> 41:58.540
Where's the body right now?

41:58.540 --> 42:02.300
They already finished the funeral since she didn't have any family.

42:03.640 --> 42:05.160
Call up the investigation team.

42:05.160 --> 42:06.020
Tell them to come to the site.

42:06.020 --> 42:07.170
Yes.

42:21.220 --> 42:22.970
There should've been a lot of blood.

42:22.970 --> 42:25.930
But because this site was cleverly disguised itself, be extra attentive.

42:25.930 --> 42:27.210
Yes!

42:28.940 --> 42:30.390
It's here!

42:33.330 --> 42:34.650
Turn off the light!

42:46.670 --> 42:49.260
It looks like the blood spread everywhere in this tub.

42:50.170 --> 42:51.640
Detective Baek.

42:52.340 --> 42:53.870
What is this?

42:54.970 --> 42:56.180
This is...

43:22.000 --> 43:26.090
This wasn't a murder.
It was a suicide scene.

43:28.640 --> 43:30.020
And this was the suicide note.

43:30.020 --> 43:32.080
What?

43:32.080 --> 43:33.610
Suicide?

43:34.450 --> 43:38.150
Cleaning the scene...
Throwing away the note...

43:38.150 --> 43:42.870
Moving the body to the motel...
Manipulating the autopsy...

43:42.870 --> 43:45.700
What are you talking about?

43:51.900 --> 43:53.380
This case...

43:55.040 --> 43:57.760
...is a suicide disguised as a homicide.

43:59.780 --> 44:00.810
What?

44:02.950 --> 44:06.610
Suicide into a homicide?

44:13.090 --> 44:16.710
<i>There's a good chance that her suicide was disguised into a homicide. </i>

44:16.710 --> 44:18.170
<i>Yeh Ri. </i>

44:18.170 --> 44:21.720
<i>Something went wrong.
Something. </i>

44:21.720 --> 44:24.010
<i>We need Kim Min Hee's psychological autopsy. </i>

44:24.010 --> 44:27.170
<i>How she lived, if she had a reason to commit suicide. </i>

44:27.170 --> 44:28.710
<i>We need to find out quick. </i>

44:37.140 --> 44:38.590
Detective Baek.

44:41.680 --> 44:46.090
How come everything we follow ends up off?

44:49.290 --> 44:52.900
Is it because we...
We...

44:52.900 --> 44:54.900
Is it because we can't understand the Devil?

44:58.950 --> 45:00.580
Even I don't know anymore.

45:02.050 --> 45:04.660
Whether we can't understand the Devil...

45:05.920 --> 45:08.210
Or whether we can't understand Yeo Ji Hoon...

45:31.970 --> 45:35.630
She attempted suicide twice.
January and April 2005.

45:35.630 --> 45:37.250
But there's records of treatment.

45:37.250 --> 45:40.670
The suicide methods are a bit off.

45:40.670 --> 45:43.280
Once, she tried hiding her face with tape.

45:43.280 --> 45:45.980
Then, she tried overdosing on drugs.

45:47.300 --> 45:48.660
Tape?

45:51.000 --> 45:53.940
Is the guardian on her records by any chance?

45:53.940 --> 45:55.000
Oh, wait.

45:57.850 --> 45:58.980
Let's see.

45:58.980 --> 46:01.400
Her guardian is Song Kyung Tae?

46:03.710 --> 46:05.420
Song Kyung Tae?

46:06.960 --> 46:10.880
Because of a person breakdown in 2005, she received lots of treatment.

46:10.880 --> 46:14.580
I think she attempted suicide from severe guilt after Jung Hee Hoo's death.

46:14.580 --> 46:18.640
But more importantly, please look into a man named Song Kyung Tae.

46:18.640 --> 46:20.890
I think he was her only guardian.

46:20.890 --> 46:24.220
I'll go meet some people who knew Kim Min Hee best.

46:29.780 --> 46:30.690
Song Kyung Tae...

46:33.610 --> 46:35.140
Song Kyung Tae...

46:39.270 --> 46:41.040
Song Kyung Tae?!

46:46.230 --> 46:49.000
Guest in Room 308,
Song Kyung Tae.

46:50.410 --> 46:54.120
Min Ho! Security camera!
The motel security camera from 7 years ago!

46:57.730 --> 47:00.390
He's the guy playing with the time differences.

47:01.410 --> 47:05.840
But Song Kyung Tae was Kim Min Hee's only guardian?

47:05.840 --> 47:08.590
Detective Baek!
Song Kyung Tae...

47:08.590 --> 47:11.530
If he was at the motel murder scene...

47:11.530 --> 47:14.690
Then, doesn't that make him F?

47:14.690 --> 47:16.870
And Kim Min Hee is the F girl?

47:19.010 --> 47:22.640
Let's go! Hurry!

47:29.650 --> 47:33.300
Ma'am. Let's stop doing this.

47:33.930 --> 47:36.110
Do you think we're happy about this too?

47:37.320 --> 47:39.060
Detective.

47:39.060 --> 47:41.560
At least go eat.

47:41.560 --> 47:43.320
Order me beef stew!

47:45.020 --> 47:46.320
Hello.

47:47.310 --> 47:50.410
I'm sorry but-
Kim Min Hee-

47:50.410 --> 47:52.960
You know Kim Min Hee, right?

47:52.960 --> 47:55.470
She used to be a member of Ha Neul with you.

47:56.240 --> 47:59.600
Min Hee?
I know Min Hee well.

48:00.850 --> 48:06.300
Do you happen to know the man she was close to?

48:07.640 --> 48:09.310
Kyung Tae?

48:09.310 --> 48:12.070
Yes! Song Kyung Tae!

48:12.070 --> 48:13.690
I see you know him.

48:13.690 --> 48:15.230
Very well.

48:16.480 --> 48:21.350
Because we all met through a difficult time, we became like family.

48:21.350 --> 48:22.990
Like family?

48:22.990 --> 48:26.360
Kyung Tae was a member too.

48:27.290 --> 48:29.610
Song Kyung Tae too?

49:00.330 --> 49:01.690
There's no one here!

49:04.550 --> 49:08.160
Detective Baek.
You should come here.

49:22.280 --> 49:24.680
This is Kyung Tae.

49:24.680 --> 49:28.610
If Min Hee was like a daughter then he was like the son.

49:30.600 --> 49:34.220
Is there something wrong with our kids?

49:34.220 --> 49:37.070
It's been a while since I've seen them.

49:37.070 --> 49:38.210
No.

49:39.770 --> 49:45.980
Was there anything strange about Kim Min Hee to Song Kyung Tae?

49:45.980 --> 49:48.550
What do you mean by strange?

49:48.550 --> 49:51.530
As if they were hiding something?

49:51.530 --> 49:56.550
I was wondering if those two were really families of victims.

50:01.240 --> 50:04.080
Hey... Detective...

50:04.080 --> 50:06.870
I don't quite understand what you're trying to say.

50:06.870 --> 50:11.770
But if you haven't seen the world,
there's something you don't know.

50:11.770 --> 50:14.170
The only people who know...

50:15.730 --> 50:18.500
...are the people who've been through it.

50:30.760 --> 50:31.950
Yes?

50:31.950 --> 50:36.460
Nam Yeh Ri! It's him!
Song Kyung Tae. He's F!

50:36.460 --> 50:40.270
His house is full of murder data and he monitors Yeo Ji Hoon!

50:40.270 --> 50:42.860
There's no doubt that this guy has Yeo Ji Hoon's address.

50:42.860 --> 50:45.790
So go over there!
We'll look into other ways.

50:45.790 --> 50:48.960
Oh and we need to find him before Yeo Ji Hoon does.

50:48.960 --> 50:51.840
That guy has a gun.
Who knows what'll happen!

50:51.840 --> 50:53.370
Yes, I got it.

51:00.530 --> 51:02.280
Yeo Ji Hoon, you punk.

51:09.630 --> 51:11.150
Ma'am?

51:13.330 --> 51:15.820
Someone I know once said...

51:16.700 --> 51:20.170
If there's something that someone really wants to hide...

51:20.170 --> 51:23.040
They wear a mask they'll never take off.

51:23.730 --> 51:28.400
If we catch your daughter's murderer, I'll come find you right away.

51:38.480 --> 51:40.290
Yeo Ji Hoon...
Yeo Ji Hoon...

51:40.290 --> 51:43.080
What in the world are you thinking of doing?

51:43.080 --> 51:44.840
What's next?

51:44.840 --> 51:47.710
Kim Min Hee asked about Yeo Ji Hoon before her suicide.

51:47.710 --> 51:51.560
That's why she used the suicide note to say sorry.

51:51.560 --> 51:55.300
The Director probably thought that she was F's girl?

51:55.300 --> 51:57.300
There's a good chance.

51:57.300 --> 51:59.300
When Yeo Ji Hoon arrived at Kim Min Hee's house...

51:59.300 --> 52:02.460
He already saw the suicide and he was probably sure of it then.

52:03.730 --> 52:05.440
That that woman was F's girl.

52:05.440 --> 52:09.590
But what in the world was he thinking to make it see like an F case?

52:10.950 --> 52:16.300
If the Jung Hee Joo case was centered on causing Yeo Ji Hoon grief...

52:16.300 --> 52:21.490
He was entirely focused on making sure that Kim Min Hee's death looked like Jung Hee Joo's murder.

52:22.350 --> 52:23.890
Motel Room 101!

52:24.990 --> 52:27.340
Tape murder...

52:27.340 --> 52:29.340
Their women...

52:30.700 --> 52:33.790
Giving back what he received.

52:34.670 --> 52:38.550
This is all to get revenge on F.

52:38.550 --> 52:41.550
The way it was 7 years ago!

52:42.160 --> 52:43.890
But for what?

52:43.890 --> 52:47.930
After 7 years of chasing F,
he realized something.

52:47.930 --> 52:50.220
That it's almost impossible to catch him.

52:50.220 --> 52:53.720
That the closer you get to catching him, the further he runs away.

52:53.720 --> 52:56.670
The only way to catch F...

52:56.670 --> 52:58.830
...is not to chase after him.

53:00.770 --> 53:02.540
But to make him chase you.

53:03.370 --> 53:05.900
If you kill F's girl and deliberately try to provoke him...

53:05.900 --> 53:07.840
He won't stay still.

53:07.840 --> 53:10.590
7 years...
I mean-

53:10.590 --> 53:12.860
If the woman remained alive...

53:12.860 --> 53:16.670
then it would hold a significant meaning to F?

53:18.290 --> 53:20.930
We needed to know that reason.

53:21.570 --> 53:26.870
If F were to make people believe that Yeo Ji Hoon killed his own girl...

53:26.870 --> 53:30.680
The most trusted Detective would have to make Yeo Ji Hoon into a criminal.

53:33.360 --> 53:36.600
Time spent at this place, 13 minutes.

53:36.600 --> 53:41.360
Yeo Ji Hoon's plan came alive in that 13 minutes.

53:43.330 --> 53:46.160
Now things are finally coming together.

53:47.520 --> 53:50.830
But where in the world is that man?

53:50.830 --> 53:52.830
He should be joining us in catching F.

53:52.830 --> 53:55.970
Making people all confused for no reason.

53:56.780 --> 53:58.630
But! Detective?

53:59.240 --> 54:00.930
What?

54:00.930 --> 54:04.520
You said he's not chasing after F but making F come to him.

54:04.520 --> 54:09.180
But, how can F come looking for the Director?

54:09.180 --> 54:11.780
Shouldn't we quickly tell them that Yeo Ji Hoon isn't the culprit?

54:11.780 --> 54:13.780
And report Song Kyung Tae wanted?

54:13.780 --> 54:16.690
No, no, no.

54:16.690 --> 54:20.410
If we act prematurely, then 7 years worth of effort will collapse.

54:21.400 --> 54:23.760
He's the master of running away.

54:31.180 --> 54:33.190
How to make him find you...

54:35.460 --> 54:37.970
How to make him find you...

55:49.770 --> 55:52.240
Min Ho, it's me, Yeh Ri.

55:52.240 --> 55:54.980
I think I know where the Director is.

55:54.980 --> 55:56.430
I'll text you the address.

56:18.210 --> 56:20.460
Where is Nam Yeh Ri right now?

56:20.460 --> 56:22.460
She hasn't called yet?

56:22.460 --> 56:24.040
Yeh Ri?

56:24.040 --> 56:26.210
Wait-
Did she call-

56:27.650 --> 56:29.600
My phone!

56:34.750 --> 56:36.450
Oh! She sent a text.

56:46.940 --> 56:48.280
Her phone is off.

56:48.280 --> 56:51.870
She said she knows where the Director is and she's going over there.

56:51.870 --> 56:53.170
Here's the address.

56:54.270 --> 56:56.500
Ahn Sung Si, Hwa Jung.

56:58.960 --> 57:00.220
Min Ho.

57:00.800 --> 57:04.460
You said that Yeo Ji Hoon sees Nam Yeh Ri off a lot recently?

57:04.460 --> 57:05.410
Yes.

57:07.940 --> 57:10.080
Nam Yeh Ri is in danger!

57:16.750 --> 57:20.190
Bait

58:37.910 --> 58:40.740
Let's just raise our badge and tell them to move!

58:41.650 --> 58:45.600
Move! Move! Move!

59:24.180 --> 59:25.630
Director?

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:54.450
Director Yeo!
Director Yeo!

01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:56.320
Director Yeo!
Director Yeo!

01:02:56.990 --> 01:02:59.710
You can't kill him!

01:02:59.710 --> 01:03:01.890
Yeo Ji Hoon!

01:03:02.450 --> 01:03:03.780
Yeo Ji Hoon!

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:06.330
Wake up you bastard!

01:03:06.330 --> 01:03:09.130
Nothing will come out of it, you bastard!

01:03:10.350 --> 01:03:11.430
Let go!

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:18.200
I'll catch him and beat him up for you!

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:19.670
Move!

01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:23.240
Calm down!
Calm down!

01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:25.830
Yeo Ji Hoon!
I know your feelings.

01:03:25.830 --> 01:03:30.200
I understand.
Ji Hoon!

01:03:35.950 --> 01:03:39.150
I understand how you feel.

01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:47.800
Can you really understand?

01:03:49.490 --> 01:03:51.560
I don't even understand.

01:04:53.590 --> 01:04:55.520
I could breathe.

01:04:58.870 --> 01:05:01.470
He didn't wrap it tightly.

01:05:04.410 --> 01:05:06.740
I should forget?

01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:10.370
I should've forgotten.

01:05:11.650 --> 01:05:13.530
I should've made myself forget.

01:05:15.370 --> 01:05:16.600
Min Hee...

01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:19.740
I killed her.

01:05:21.470 --> 01:05:23.630
Tell him to forget.

01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:26.590
Even if he can't truly forget...

01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:32.320
Even if it's fake...
Tell him to forget.

01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:37.940
To forget?

01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:55.450
Center Manager?
It's me, Yeh Ri.

01:05:55.450 --> 01:05:59.820
Please look into Kim Min Hee and Song Kyung Tae's family.

01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:02.980
There's a chance that they forged their identity.

01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:46.410
That's right.

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:50.260
It doesn't make sense that our meeting has an audience.

01:06:52.060 --> 01:06:55.380
You, who I've waited for 7 years, and me.

01:06:55.380 --> 01:06:58.240
At this moment, I'm craving for you.

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:02.410
We'll need the right destination.

01:07:03.690 --> 01:07:07.690
I need a little more time.

01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:11.790
All the time I've waited to meet you.

01:07:11.790 --> 01:07:14.330
My soul became rotten from this time.

01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:17.530
But there's something I didn't prepare.

01:07:19.790 --> 01:07:21.570
When I meet you...

01:07:23.470 --> 01:07:25.310
What should I do?

01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:20.660
There's nowhere left to go.

01:09:21.569 --> 01:09:24.540
Or is it that I don't need to go?

01:09:26.540 --> 01:09:28.490
What should we do now?

01:09:30.370 --> 01:09:31.910
Let's have fun.

01:09:32.899 --> 01:09:34.760
Since I've waited this long.

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:42.399
You won't save me, right?

01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:46.399
I'm sorry.

01:09:54.290 --> 01:09:55.820
Is this fun to you?

01:09:58.850 --> 01:10:01.900
I don't know about killing but being killed shouldn't be fun.

01:10:04.710 --> 01:10:06.780
It's not that.

01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:10.220
Was it Jung Hee Joo?
Your lover.

01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:12.540
I said the same thing to her.

01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:17.310
She kept asking me to save her.

01:10:20.250 --> 01:10:21.880
"I'm sorry."

01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:30.550
I see.

01:10:43.590 --> 01:10:45.140
Yes, Center Manager?

01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:48.020
<i>Yeh Ri. I just barely found something. </i>

01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:51.570
<i>I think Kim Min Hee changed her name and her identity. </i>

01:10:51.570 --> 01:10:54.200
<i>She's the younger sister of the 2004 Dae Jeon murder victim, </i>

01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:56.110
<i>Song Kyung Mi </i>

01:10:56.110 --> 01:10:59.330
What?!
Dae Jeon?

01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:01.680
<i>No other family. </i>

01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:06.480
<i>Covering the faces with tape.
The media was all over this case. </i>

01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:13.380
Did you know she had a younger sister?

01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:16.430
I know. The college student.

01:11:16.430 --> 01:11:18.810
It was just her and her sister.

01:11:20.370 --> 01:11:22.720
<i>Oh and Song Kyung Tae. </i>

01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:25.750
<i>He's also a family member of a past victim. </i>

01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:29.770
<i>He's the brother of the 2004 Seoul murder victim, Song Mi Joo. </i>

01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:33.620
Song Mi Joo?

01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:41.080
<i>He quit his job in 2004 and he started targeting the police... </i>

01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:44.450
<i>...as a magazine news reporter for 2 years. </i>

01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:52.300
<i>They accused the mom of forcing her daughter to work at a bar. </i>

01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:55.020
<i>The whole family ran away overnight and that's it. </i>

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:06.550
Was there anything strange about Kim Min Hee to Song Kyung Tae?

01:12:06.550 --> 01:12:08.630
What do you mean strange?

01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:13.410
I was wondering if those two were really families of victims.

01:12:13.410 --> 01:12:16.930
I don't quite understand what you're trying to say.

01:12:16.930 --> 01:12:21.970
But if you haven't seen the world,
there's something you don't know.

01:12:21.970 --> 01:12:24.540
The only people who know...

01:12:25.990 --> 01:12:28.780
...are the people who've been through it.

01:12:31.390 --> 01:12:34.120
People who've been through it...

01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:36.020
Will... know...

01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:41.400
Let's end this.

01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:46.940
Now, you can end your never ending guilt.

01:12:47.660 --> 01:12:48.840
Guilt?

01:12:52.990 --> 01:12:56.870
More like finally getting rid of your trash revenge.

01:12:56.870 --> 01:12:57.880
No.

01:12:59.090 --> 01:13:02.590
Revenge is when you live the rest of your life for one act.

01:13:02.590 --> 01:13:04.220
Your nature?

01:13:04.220 --> 01:13:08.820
Guilt and shame for not being able to protect your woman.

01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:11.350
Think about it, Ji Hoon.

01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:17.020
What happens to you after you kill me?

01:13:17.020 --> 01:13:21.670
After your revenge,
I wonder what will be left of you.

01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:28.050
Finally!

01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:31.830
The end of you?

01:13:40.430 --> 01:13:41.930
Was it for this?

01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:45.670
The reason why you called me out?

01:13:45.670 --> 01:13:48.670
We're on the same page.
You didn't know?

01:13:55.330 --> 01:13:56.780
Let's just finish this.

01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:40.820
Song Kyung Tae is not F...

01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:44.500
He was chasing F...

01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:51.850
The Director, Detective Baek, Min Ho and I...

01:14:51.850 --> 01:14:54.120
Never thought about it that way...

01:14:56.410 --> 01:14:58.380
The criminal that killed Hee Joo...

01:15:00.310 --> 01:15:02.640
Maybe it wasn't F...

01:15:08.130 --> 01:15:09.480
Then...

01:15:48.570 --> 01:15:50.920
Detective!
Detective!

01:15:56.330 --> 01:16:00.720
Please catch the criminal that killed my daughter!

01:16:01.110 --> 01:16:05.740
Ma'am. Please let go of this hand.

01:16:05.740 --> 01:16:08.460
I completely understand your feelings.

01:16:08.460 --> 01:16:11.210
Please let go of this hand.

01:16:11.210 --> 01:16:13.410
Please, please catch him.

01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:21.040
Ma'am! Please let go of this hand!

01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:21.050
I understand! Now let go!
Ma'am! Please let go of this hand!

01:16:21.050 --> 01:16:24.790
I understand! Now let go!

01:16:27.700 --> 01:16:30.170
Just because she was a bar girl!

01:16:33.820 --> 01:16:42.170
If this happened to your family,
would you close the case like this?

01:16:46.820 --> 01:16:57.020
If this happened to your daughter,
would you be able to close this case?!

01:17:33.330 --> 01:17:35.600
This is case on memory.

01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:40.230
The victim's families...

01:17:41.570 --> 01:17:43.990
From their perspective...

01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:47.080
Their memory is different.

01:17:53.370 --> 01:17:55.900
Song Kyung Tae...

01:17:55.900 --> 01:17:58.730
What are you doing right now?

01:18:00.270 --> 01:18:02.990
Why are you acting as if you're F?!

01:18:13.030 --> 01:18:14.220
Ji Hoon...

01:18:17.590 --> 01:18:19.080
I'm ready.

01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:41.530
Tell him to forget.

01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:45.160
Even if he can't truly forget...

01:18:47.260 --> 01:18:50.820
Even if it's fake,
tell him to forget.

01:18:55.930 --> 01:18:59.360
It's unfortunate that there's no music.

01:19:02.430 --> 01:19:07.260
The music that Hee Joo and I listened to together.

01:19:08.570 --> 01:19:10.520
Shut your mouth!

01:19:22.710 --> 01:19:23.780
This bastard.

01:19:25.030 --> 01:19:26.220
This bastard!

01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:31.080
I should forget.

01:19:32.570 --> 01:19:34.130
I should've made myself forget.

01:19:36.250 --> 01:19:37.330
Min Hee...

01:19:39.060 --> 01:19:40.310
I killed her.

01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:29.640
I'm going to keep you alive.

01:20:30.820 --> 01:20:32.020
Stay alive.

01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:36.230
From now on,
I'm going to start over.

01:20:37.420 --> 01:20:39.000
I'll show you.

01:20:39.950 --> 01:20:42.260
That I can live away from the pain.

01:20:43.390 --> 01:20:46.240
So you stay alive and watch me be happy.

01:20:48.490 --> 01:20:50.550
In your pain.

01:20:50.550 --> 01:20:53.460
From now on,
this is your hell.

01:21:07.190 --> 01:21:09.210
Let's stop this now.

01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:13.290
Let's just stop.

01:21:35.540 --> 01:21:39.650
1 year later

<i>This isn't a suicide. Like you know,
it doesn't match his character. </i>

01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:23.480
<i>There's no cameras at all. </i>

01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:25.960
<i>It's not going to be easy to find him. </i>

01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:32.990
<i>Why would he bring back a case from 20 years ago? </i>

01:23:32.990 --> 01:23:35.590
<i>This case from the past... </i>

01:23:35.590 --> 01:23:38.250
<i>A message about who this was all for. </i>

01:23:38.250 --> 01:23:40.600
<i>Then, these cases... </i>
