WEBVTT

00:02.121 --> 00:04.705
Ab, $12.99 is such a splurge for wine.

00:04.791 --> 00:05.656
You're spoiling me.

00:05.742 --> 00:07.158
don't, it's your birthday, dude.

00:07.210 --> 00:09.794
You deserve a bottle, not a box.

00:09.829 --> 00:11.212
I made a reservation and everything

00:11.297 --> 00:13.881
and I cannot wait for you
to open up this b-day gift.

00:13.966 --> 00:15.499
Oh, I'm dying. It's so good.

00:15.551 --> 00:17.168
I don't know.

00:17.220 --> 00:19.920
23 is such a nothing birthday,
though, you know, like...

00:20.006 --> 00:21.138
No.

00:21.174 --> 00:22.590
22, you graduate college.

00:22.675 --> 00:24.842
21, you're suddenly
allowed to be an alcoholic.

00:24.894 --> 00:26.844
- 20, you lose your virginity.
- Right.

00:26.929 --> 00:28.763
19's your last teen year.

00:28.848 --> 00:29.930
18, you get to vote.

00:30.016 --> 00:31.232
17, you get to drive.

00:31.317 --> 00:33.517
16's your sweet 16, 15's your quincea?era.

00:33.569 --> 00:34.852
- See?
- I guess.

00:34.904 --> 00:36.687
23 was pretty great for me, I
mean, it's the year I met you.

00:36.773 --> 00:37.738
Really?

00:39.025 --> 00:40.024
Oh, my god.

00:40.076 --> 00:41.776
Oh, my...

00:41.861 --> 00:43.611
- Tree man.
- Oh, my damn god.

00:43.696 --> 00:44.745
Every time he gets me, every time.

00:44.831 --> 00:46.163
He needs a little bell.

00:46.199 --> 00:48.916
Or like, a personal triangle
he's playing all the time.

00:49.001 --> 00:51.368
He could cause a heart attack.

00:51.420 --> 00:52.620
For real, though, this wine,

00:52.705 --> 00:54.705
this like, pricey, high-class wine

00:54.757 --> 00:57.174
is setting up your entire year.

00:57.210 --> 00:59.009
If we weren't going to this BYOB, I mean,

00:59.045 --> 01:00.211
this would be like, 30 bucks.

01:00.296 --> 01:02.513
I know, I love a "BYOB".

01:02.548 --> 01:03.848
I love a "BYOF"... bring your own food,

01:03.883 --> 01:05.800
or a "BYOS"... bring your own silverware.

01:05.885 --> 01:07.434
I'd wash the dishes if they'd let me.

01:07.520 --> 01:09.854
This is the exact opposite reason why

01:09.889 --> 01:10.888
restaurants exist at all.

01:10.973 --> 01:11.889
I mean, why not just eat at home?

01:11.974 --> 01:13.357
I don't have a table.

01:13.392 --> 01:15.025
You girls are so pretty.

01:15.061 --> 01:16.894
You should smile.

01:21.317 --> 01:23.400

two and one-one **

01:37.633 --> 01:39.967
So, I've been spending all
morning writing out my will.

01:40.052 --> 01:42.419
My dad said it's never
too early, and I agree.

01:42.471 --> 01:44.755
Ilana, you're only 23, dude.

01:44.807 --> 01:45.923
Okay, you know what?

01:45.975 --> 01:48.225
My people plan for death, Abbi.

01:48.261 --> 01:49.927
I'm Jewish too.

01:49.979 --> 01:51.762
Okay, but you're a mainline Jew.

01:51.814 --> 01:54.098
New York Jews wake up every day

01:54.150 --> 01:56.433
just thinking about how
they're going to die.

01:56.485 --> 01:59.904
I think about death.

01:59.939 --> 02:02.740
Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex.

02:02.775 --> 02:03.824
Whoa, sex is right.

02:03.910 --> 02:05.159
Oh, my goodness.

02:05.244 --> 02:06.911
You wrote your will on a napkin?

02:06.946 --> 02:08.579
I made copies, obviously.

02:08.614 --> 02:11.115
Come on.

02:11.167 --> 02:13.500
I know, how have I never had...

02:13.586 --> 02:14.869
I know! How has it ever...

02:14.954 --> 02:16.754
it's always on the table.

02:16.789 --> 02:19.590
Hold up... you gave me power of attorney?

02:19.625 --> 02:22.793
I need you to be able to fight
against my killer or whatever,

02:22.879 --> 02:24.511
and then option the rights.

02:24.597 --> 02:26.463
I also am looking into a few mutual funds

02:26.549 --> 02:28.098
and I'm having some, um...

02:28.134 --> 02:29.884
Valuables appraised.

02:32.221 --> 02:33.771
Are you (Bleep) talking
about the beanie babies?

02:33.806 --> 02:34.972
Don't!

02:35.024 --> 02:37.057
Stop, I can't even talk about this.

02:37.143 --> 02:38.809
- They're...
- With the flamingo one?

02:38.861 --> 02:39.727
Dude, I can't even...

02:39.812 --> 02:41.312
there is still some value there,

02:41.397 --> 02:43.147
especially in the ones that
like, commemorate events, okay?

02:43.232 --> 02:45.482
It's cyclical, the market is cyclical.

02:45.624 --> 02:47.841
Maybe you... you don't
know about the market.

02:47.876 --> 02:49.376
But it's cyclical.

02:49.461 --> 02:51.544
You're getting into like,
the eBay beanie baby game?

02:51.596 --> 02:53.680
Yeah, baby, it's a whole other math game.

02:53.715 --> 02:54.965
I've got a math head. All right, listen.

02:55.050 --> 02:57.017
Math mind.

02:57.052 --> 02:58.051
I'm all for wills.

02:58.136 --> 02:59.386
I think it's a good idea

02:59.438 --> 03:00.637
even though I think you're very young.

03:00.722 --> 03:02.439
But people get crazy
about material possessions

03:02.524 --> 03:06.526
and it's like, who even owns
anything these days anyway?

03:06.561 --> 03:07.777
Can you please spare a dollar?

03:07.863 --> 03:09.863
- Yeah.
- I just wanna to get some food.

03:09.898 --> 03:10.647
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

03:10.732 --> 03:11.731
Yeah.

03:11.817 --> 03:12.782
- Appreciate it.
- Bless.

03:12.868 --> 03:14.701
I hope it helps.

03:14.736 --> 03:16.903
Oh, my god, we are...

03:16.989 --> 03:18.571
Can I get a buck?

03:18.657 --> 03:19.823
Oh, sorry.

03:19.908 --> 03:22.325
But you just gave her a buck.

03:22.411 --> 03:24.878
We can't give everyone
on the block a dollar.

03:24.913 --> 03:26.079
Well, actually, you could.

03:26.164 --> 03:27.414
You just don't want to.

03:27.499 --> 03:29.332
Actually, we couldn't, because
we're going to the meat sack

03:29.418 --> 03:30.750
and it's a cash-only restaurant.

03:30.836 --> 03:33.303
Wow, that must be nice.

03:33.388 --> 03:35.338
Okay, we could bring
you our leftovers, after.

03:35.424 --> 03:37.173
I was gonna have them for lunch...

03:37.259 --> 03:39.809
Oh, really? 'Cause that
would be so generous of you.

03:39.895 --> 03:40.810
Oh, it's no problem.

03:40.896 --> 03:41.761
I'm glad we...

03:41.813 --> 03:42.929
Okay, he's being sarcastic.

03:43.015 --> 03:44.264
Oh.

03:45.100 --> 03:46.933
Michelle, party of two.

03:46.985 --> 03:48.818
Michelle, party of two.

03:48.904 --> 03:51.821
Three, two, one.

03:51.907 --> 03:53.773
Okay, you lose.

03:53.859 --> 03:54.774
I have a reservation.

03:54.860 --> 03:56.576
It's under, uh...

03:56.611 --> 03:57.827
You're my next two-top.

03:57.913 --> 03:59.829
Great. A'ight?

03:59.915 --> 04:01.614
Hope you're hungry.

04:01.666 --> 04:03.033
Get the stomach stretched.

04:03.118 --> 04:04.084
I cannot wait.

04:04.119 --> 04:06.586
I love me some dumplings.

04:06.621 --> 04:08.838
It's like a squirrel clutch
with a meatball in it.

04:08.924 --> 04:11.174
Little Wayne, party of two.

04:12.961 --> 04:14.511
Oh, my god, Weezy's here.

04:14.596 --> 04:15.512
He is so real.

04:15.597 --> 04:18.048
No, that's us.

04:18.132 --> 04:20.466
We... are Little Wayne.

04:22.554 --> 04:24.971
Oh, you are sweeping me off my feet.

04:26.525 --> 04:30.110
Oh, yum. Oh, my god.

04:34.649 --> 04:36.816
You can get as many
dumplings as you want, okay?

04:36.902 --> 04:39.202
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

04:39.287 --> 04:41.037
Oh, my god! Wow!

04:41.123 --> 04:42.155
Yo, girlfriends.

04:42.207 --> 04:44.074
Hey... long time, no freakin' see.

04:44.159 --> 04:45.909
Look at you two!

04:45.994 --> 04:47.494
Couple of Madonnas, huh?

04:47.546 --> 04:49.546
Oh, gosh, so fashion, baby.

04:49.631 --> 04:50.497
I love that!

04:50.582 --> 04:52.999
- How are you guys?
- Yeah.

04:53.085 --> 04:54.501
When was the last time we saw you?

04:54.586 --> 04:56.052
I think it was at our show...

04:56.138 --> 04:58.338
- Yeah.
-... With Elliott.

04:58.390 --> 05:00.340
- It was our show choir show.
- Yeah.

05:03.178 --> 05:04.177
It was a long time ago.

05:04.229 --> 05:05.562
Can I ask you, do you live in New York

05:05.647 --> 05:07.847
or did you move, because you never respond

05:07.933 --> 05:11.684
to any of my Facebook, uh, invites.

05:11.770 --> 05:12.936
I get so confused on Facebook.

05:13.021 --> 05:14.020
- Me too!
- Like, how it works.

05:14.106 --> 05:16.940
What are all the numbers and the things?

05:17.025 --> 05:18.525
- I know!
- I don't know what they go with.

05:18.577 --> 05:21.027
- It's kind of change...
- It changes fast, the interface.

05:21.113 --> 05:23.113
- I'm afraid to click it.
- Yes.

05:23.198 --> 05:25.031
You know, I'm actually,
I'm really kind of sad

05:25.083 --> 05:27.534
that you guys missed my
last solo performance.

05:27.586 --> 05:29.169
Yeah.

05:29.204 --> 05:31.538
We're so sorry that that happened.

05:31.590 --> 05:33.506
We don't even know you guys that well.

05:33.542 --> 05:35.625
Honestly, Chris, I feel like
you should give them some of it.

05:35.710 --> 05:36.676
You should show them a little bit.

05:36.711 --> 05:38.761
Give them a little piece, a taste.

05:38.847 --> 05:40.880
Oh, you don't have to do that.

05:40.932 --> 05:42.549
- You don't have to.
- We're at dinner.

05:42.601 --> 05:44.801
I was born the day the Challenger exploded.

05:44.886 --> 05:45.802
Honey, no.

05:45.887 --> 05:46.936
No, no, no.

05:47.022 --> 05:48.555
Do the ending, do the climax.

05:48.607 --> 05:50.390
Do "Dear Uncle".

05:50.442 --> 05:52.725
Um, please suspend your
sense of disbelief, uh,

05:52.811 --> 05:55.862
as the lighting here is not
good and it's not a theater,

05:55.897 --> 05:57.447
but all the world is a stage.

05:57.532 --> 05:58.898
Here we go.

05:58.984 --> 06:02.485
No, Uncle, please, don't!

06:02.571 --> 06:05.238
Okay, so he is on stage, he's fully naked,

06:05.323 --> 06:07.207
and he's maximum erect.

06:07.242 --> 06:10.293
Uncle, please, don't do it, Uncle!

06:10.378 --> 06:13.463
Okay, he's standing on
a shredded American flag,

06:13.548 --> 06:14.664
little pieces.

06:14.749 --> 06:17.250
Uncle, Uncle Sam!

06:17.335 --> 06:19.469
He ejaculates!

06:19.554 --> 06:21.137
Into the flag.

06:21.223 --> 06:22.589
Yes.

06:22.641 --> 06:24.507
That's the twist.

06:24.593 --> 06:25.925
- It's a bit of a statement.
- Yeah.

06:25.977 --> 06:28.144
It's like, about currency
and politics and government

06:28.230 --> 06:29.679
and all that.

06:29.764 --> 06:31.264
Um, we can push your tables together

06:31.349 --> 06:32.432
and then maybe you can
talk a little bit quieter.

06:32.484 --> 06:33.516
No, please don't.

06:33.602 --> 06:34.767
Excuse me, Sir.

06:34.819 --> 06:35.852
That's a great idea!

06:35.937 --> 06:36.769
- Yes!
- Yes!

06:36.821 --> 06:37.737
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

06:37.772 --> 06:40.106
Beep, beep, beep.

06:40.158 --> 06:41.908
Honk-honk,
honk-honk.

06:41.943 --> 06:44.277
Beep, beep, beep.

06:44.362 --> 06:45.945
Hi!

06:46.031 --> 06:47.780
This is a good group.

06:47.866 --> 06:51.501
Oh, my... holy (Bleep).

06:51.586 --> 06:52.585
What the heck?

06:52.621 --> 06:53.670
What the (Bleep)?

06:53.755 --> 06:55.705
I'm such a klutz, we have to go.

06:55.790 --> 06:59.125
Now we gotta go, is what... it is.

06:59.211 --> 07:00.877
We gotta... we have to go.

07:00.962 --> 07:02.795
- Gotta go, we gotta go.
- Oh, my god.

07:02.881 --> 07:04.013
I can't be out.

07:04.099 --> 07:05.348
I can't be out like this.

07:05.433 --> 07:07.217
We have to go, that's... sorry, everybody.

07:07.302 --> 07:08.685
I should go home right now.

07:08.770 --> 07:10.186
This is never gonna come out!

07:10.272 --> 07:11.387
Let's go. Let's do it.

07:11.473 --> 07:12.722
Here we go.

07:12.807 --> 07:16.643
Wait, you can't leave
with an open container.

07:16.728 --> 07:18.528
Okay. Okay.

07:18.613 --> 07:19.812
We will not do that.

07:19.864 --> 07:22.782
You guys know wine is heart healthy, so...

07:22.817 --> 07:24.534
- Mm-hmm, and...
- Here we go.

07:24.619 --> 07:25.985
Just do that.

07:34.629 --> 07:35.545
Mmm!

07:38.500 --> 07:41.084
Oh... oh, my god.

07:42.754 --> 07:43.753
You have a good...

07:43.838 --> 07:46.472
California, I can tell.

07:46.508 --> 07:47.640
You have a good rest of your night.

07:47.676 --> 07:48.841
Sayonara.

07:48.893 --> 07:51.511
Bye, you guys. See you guys.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.763
I'm sorry, but they are too much.

07:53.848 --> 07:55.098
Yeah.

07:56.020 --> 07:57.280
Party of five?

07:57.623 --> 07:58.589
Scott Wolf?

07:58.624 --> 08:00.090
Oh, hey, hey!

08:00.125 --> 08:01.625
Where are the leftovers?

08:01.677 --> 08:04.044
It was... honestly too annoying.

08:04.129 --> 08:05.095
We didn't even order.

08:05.130 --> 08:06.346
Wow, too annoying?

08:06.432 --> 08:07.547
Must be nice.

08:07.633 --> 08:10.884
Must... be... nice.

08:15.474 --> 08:17.975
Must be nice!

08:18.027 --> 08:19.142
Jeez.

08:19.194 --> 08:20.727
I feel bad.

08:20.813 --> 08:23.864
You know, runaway teens have it so tough.

08:23.949 --> 08:27.451
He probably came out to his
family, they kicked him out,

08:27.486 --> 08:29.319
so he hopped a boxcar from Oklahoma

08:29.371 --> 08:33.155
and now he's turning tricks on St. Mark's.

08:33.207 --> 08:36.460
You know, child sex
trafficking is all around us.

08:36.495 --> 08:38.879
Wigs!

08:38.964 --> 08:40.998
Ab, I gotta go get a wig, it's my birthday!

08:41.049 --> 08:42.332
All right, you go ahead.

08:42.418 --> 08:43.216
I'm going to this Thai place
and see if there's a wait.

08:43.302 --> 08:44.668
Dope.

08:44.720 --> 08:47.587
Everyone's like, "where's
Christina, where's Christina?"

08:47.673 --> 08:49.840
I can't keep saying you're
in the keys at your parents.

08:49.892 --> 08:52.009
What do you want me to say?

08:52.094 --> 08:54.144
"Oh, my girlfriend
moved out seven weeks ago

08:54.179 --> 08:58.231
and I'm falling apart and my
dick doesn't work anymore, so... "

08:58.317 --> 08:59.182
Dude.

08:59.234 --> 09:00.851
Christina moved out?

09:03.355 --> 09:05.022
Oh.

09:06.408 --> 09:08.241
What happened with the wigs?

09:08.327 --> 09:09.743
I got distracted by this business guido.

09:09.828 --> 09:10.744
Oh...

09:10.829 --> 09:12.195
All right.

09:12.281 --> 09:13.280
I put our name in.

09:13.365 --> 09:14.865
- 45 minutes, we're in.
- Whoo!

09:14.917 --> 09:17.034
Yeah! Ugh.

09:18.407 --> 09:21.024
I feel like every city has a parrot dude.

09:21.110 --> 09:23.110
You ever see the guy
with the cat on his head?

09:23.195 --> 09:24.861
Yeah, wonder if it ever touches the ground.

09:24.947 --> 09:27.664
If it does, that would be disgusting.

09:27.750 --> 09:29.616
Imagine if those two guys met.

09:29.701 --> 09:31.918
I think the parrot would win.

09:31.954 --> 09:33.920
God, I have such a wig face.

09:33.956 --> 09:35.589
It's not even funny.

09:35.624 --> 09:37.457
This is the kind of wig you get buried in.

09:37.543 --> 09:38.708
Why would you want to get buried in a wig?

09:38.794 --> 09:40.260
It's the last time people get to see you.

09:40.295 --> 09:43.463
Yeah, exactly, I want to look
dope as (Bleep) at my funeral.

09:43.549 --> 09:45.766
It's my last party, you know?

09:45.801 --> 09:47.050
I even made a playlist already.

09:47.136 --> 09:51.138
It's pretty much RuPaul's
"Supermodel" on repeat

09:51.190 --> 09:53.607
and I need leather tissues.

09:53.642 --> 09:55.475
I also want everyone
I've ever hooked up with

09:55.527 --> 09:57.978
to just jerk off together.

09:58.063 --> 09:59.362
That might bring me back to life.

09:59.448 --> 10:00.313
Seriously.

10:00.365 --> 10:02.365
Yo, you should be careful.

10:02.451 --> 10:04.317
I just want like, a really nice funeral.

10:04.369 --> 10:06.119
You know, like, like, on a hill.

10:06.155 --> 10:08.655
You know, like everyone
would be really sad,

10:08.707 --> 10:10.123
like hill funerals usually are?

10:10.159 --> 10:11.241
Yeah.

10:11.326 --> 10:12.242
Everyone would be crying,

10:12.327 --> 10:15.879
maybe even hysterically, but then, then,

10:15.964 --> 10:18.548
everyone has to go to six flags, my treat.

10:18.634 --> 10:19.583
That is genius!

10:19.668 --> 10:21.251
You can't be upset at six flags, you can't.

10:21.336 --> 10:22.219
No, no.

10:22.304 --> 10:23.420
You can even "Weekend at Bernie's" me,

10:23.505 --> 10:25.589
but Ilana, no log flume, for real.

10:25.674 --> 10:27.507
How am I going to Bernie
you if I'm already dead?

10:27.593 --> 10:30.510
No, I'm obviously dying first.

10:30.562 --> 10:33.346
No, the husband always dies first.

10:33.398 --> 10:34.431
First of all, we're not married.

10:34.516 --> 10:36.316
Second of all, I'm the wife?

10:36.351 --> 10:37.818
You're the other husband.

10:37.853 --> 10:39.820
All right, agree to disagree.

10:39.855 --> 10:42.439
A to D.

10:42.524 --> 10:44.858
Oh, my god.

10:44.943 --> 10:47.077
I am definitely getting this.

10:47.162 --> 10:49.696
I am a female and I love to inspect bodies.

10:49.781 --> 10:51.164
Yeah, I think that's what that stands for.

10:51.200 --> 10:52.532
Me too.

10:52.618 --> 10:55.252
I'm getting this because I
look like I've been stabbed.

10:55.337 --> 10:57.954
I look like I'm mid-death.

10:58.040 --> 10:59.256
Challah back, y'all.

10:59.341 --> 11:00.590
Challah back, y'all.

11:00.676 --> 11:03.376
All right, I'll take
this and we'll take these.

11:03.428 --> 11:05.545
Wigs are 10, shirts are a buck each.

11:05.631 --> 11:07.964
Here you go.

11:08.050 --> 11:09.516
Oh, I love St. Mark's.

11:13.388 --> 11:15.388
I'm alone!

11:15.474 --> 11:17.774
Oh, so sad. Been there.

11:17.860 --> 11:19.392
All right, so we can eat as
many dumplings as you want...

11:19.478 --> 11:20.477
- Thank you.
- ... Whatever kind.

11:20.562 --> 11:21.862
Dude.

11:23.565 --> 11:25.398
Yo, yo, yo, that girl
just did a tongue thing.

11:25.484 --> 11:26.533
A tongue thing?

11:26.568 --> 11:28.318
Yeah! Hey, what'd you do?

11:28.403 --> 11:29.319
I don't know.

11:29.404 --> 11:31.238
Yeah, it was like...

11:31.290 --> 11:32.405
No, it wasn't.

11:32.491 --> 11:34.791
I just, I was just like, cute...

11:34.877 --> 11:38.328
You know, I'm not trying to
start a whole conversation.

11:38.413 --> 11:44.834
You are seriously beautiful,
like, really, really beautiful.

11:44.920 --> 11:47.137
No, you are.

11:47.222 --> 11:48.171
Whoa!

11:48.257 --> 11:49.256
Holy (Bleep)!

11:49.308 --> 11:52.175
Hey! Ilana, your gift!

11:53.312 --> 11:55.428
Stop him, he took our bag!

11:57.516 --> 11:59.065
Drop the bag, you (Bleep).

11:59.101 --> 12:00.934
When I catch you, I
swear I'm going to rip out

12:01.019 --> 12:03.486
your disgusting little
ball sack until you (Bleep)

12:03.572 --> 12:04.821
throw up your own dick!

12:04.907 --> 12:05.689
Damn it!

12:05.774 --> 12:07.774
Stop, we're the FBI, bitch!

12:07.859 --> 12:09.276
Hey, watch it!

12:09.328 --> 12:11.194
Stop that guy!

12:11.280 --> 12:12.279
Watch out, watch out!

12:12.331 --> 12:13.530
Hey, come on.

12:16.785 --> 12:17.584
Hey!

12:24.459 --> 12:25.292
My wig!

12:25.344 --> 12:26.960
Leave it, leave it!

12:27.629 --> 12:29.129
Market, market... go!

12:37.272 --> 12:40.890
Split up!

12:40.976 --> 12:42.309
Oh!

12:42.361 --> 12:43.643
Ass(Bleep).

12:45.981 --> 12:47.647
Go around, go around! Oh, (Bleep).

12:54.406 --> 12:55.739
Where is he? Oh, my god.

12:55.824 --> 12:57.457
He just (Bleep) ran down here, I...

12:57.492 --> 12:58.959
Go, there, there!

13:35.247 --> 13:36.946
Drop it, you (Bleep)
face, I swear I'll rip...

13:37.032 --> 13:39.115
come on, (Bleep)hole! Ball sack!

13:42.371 --> 13:44.921
Jesus.

13:46.925 --> 13:49.509
All right, okay.

13:49.544 --> 13:50.593
Yep.

13:50.679 --> 13:51.795
Hopefully no one will take that.

13:51.880 --> 13:54.931
- Okay.
- Oh, I have a lot in here.

13:55.017 --> 13:56.349
Okay?

13:56.385 --> 13:57.467
Okay.

13:59.354 --> 14:01.805
Dude, he's going into a house!

14:01.890 --> 14:03.723
- Come on!
- All right.

14:03.775 --> 14:05.525
Okay, he's getting away.

14:05.560 --> 14:07.727
Okay, here we go, I need just one...

14:07.779 --> 14:10.030
All right, you got it,
and then I just straddled.

14:10.065 --> 14:12.198
- This is uncomfortable.
- I know.

14:12.234 --> 14:14.117
I don't feel like I wanna...

14:14.202 --> 14:15.652
You know what?

14:15.737 --> 14:17.370
I'm gonna go back down through the kitchen,

14:17.406 --> 14:18.872
and I'm gonna be so fast,

14:18.907 --> 14:20.373
and it's gonna be so good,

14:20.409 --> 14:22.075
and we're gonna get the gift!

14:31.734 --> 14:32.733
Can I help you?

14:32.818 --> 14:33.951
A guy just ran in here.

14:34.036 --> 14:36.620
We were chasing him
'cause he stole my gift.

14:36.705 --> 14:37.988
He stole my bag. Call the police.

14:38.073 --> 14:38.989
He stole it right out of my hand.

14:39.074 --> 14:40.240
He's in here, he's in your house.

14:40.326 --> 14:42.459
Please, come in.

14:42.545 --> 14:44.545
Okay, uh...

14:46.715 --> 14:48.081
Timothy.

14:48.167 --> 14:50.551
Can you please come down here?

14:50.586 --> 14:52.219
Timothy.

14:52.254 --> 14:54.221
That boy lives here?

14:54.256 --> 14:56.890
Boy? He's 34 years old.

14:56.926 --> 14:58.675
I had him when I was very young.

14:58.761 --> 15:00.144
Timothy.

15:00.229 --> 15:02.429
Timothy!

15:02.481 --> 15:03.564
Jesus Christ.

15:03.599 --> 15:04.681
What, mother?

15:04.767 --> 15:06.233
Can you explain yourself?

15:06.268 --> 15:09.269
Did you just steal
something from these girls?

15:09.321 --> 15:10.571
Yeah, it was a (Bleep) joke.

15:10.606 --> 15:11.655
Chill out.

15:11.740 --> 15:12.940
You chill out!

15:12.992 --> 15:14.191
Chill out!

15:14.276 --> 15:16.360
And get their stuff now.

15:16.445 --> 15:17.411
Ugh!

15:17.446 --> 15:19.413
Now!

15:19.448 --> 15:20.948
I'm sorry.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.418
Please, don't press charges.

15:24.453 --> 15:25.953
No, it's gonna... it's all right.

15:26.005 --> 15:30.958
Ever since he dropped out
of grad school, he's, uh,

15:31.010 --> 15:33.510
he's given me a lot of grief.

15:33.596 --> 15:35.929
I don't know what to do... throw
him out, put him on the street.

15:35.965 --> 15:38.432
He'd love that.

15:38.467 --> 15:39.633
I'm so rude.

15:39.718 --> 15:41.885
Uh, would you...

15:41.971 --> 15:43.804
Oh.

15:43.856 --> 15:45.806
Would you, uh, like a drink?

15:45.891 --> 15:47.808
No, no, no. It's fine.

15:51.864 --> 15:53.564
It's a soft gift, so it's okay.

15:53.649 --> 15:55.199
Timothy!

15:55.284 --> 15:56.483
What is wrong with you?

15:56.569 --> 15:58.619
I don't know, mom. Why don't you tell me?

15:58.654 --> 15:59.786
You're the psychiatrist.

15:59.822 --> 16:00.988
Or do I need to make an appointment?

16:01.040 --> 16:02.456
Maybe you should.

16:02.491 --> 16:08.662
But you can't afford me
because you don't work.

16:08.747 --> 16:10.581
You love this, don't you?

16:10.666 --> 16:12.666
You think I like this?

16:12.718 --> 16:14.167
My only son.

16:14.253 --> 16:17.137
Having to lie to my friends about

16:17.172 --> 16:18.972
what my son does with his life?

16:19.008 --> 16:21.842
He's a loser, loser, loser,

16:21.894 --> 16:26.647
loser, loser, loser, loser, loser life.

16:26.682 --> 16:27.681
Loser.

16:27.733 --> 16:29.182
Right, 'cause you have to lie about me

16:29.268 --> 16:31.818
but not about anything in
your perfect little life.

16:31.854 --> 16:33.570
Not about the wine, the painkillers,

16:33.656 --> 16:34.571
my father.

16:34.657 --> 16:36.857
Do I look like the son of a quarterback?

16:36.942 --> 16:38.742
I will...

16:38.827 --> 16:41.528
I never asked to be born!

16:48.871 --> 16:50.621
Let me tell you something.

16:50.706 --> 16:53.840
I'm a very good mother,
it's just sometimes...

16:53.876 --> 16:56.793
You get a dud!

16:56.879 --> 17:00.380
A (Bleep) dud!

17:00.466 --> 17:03.550
I'm just going to grab...

17:03.636 --> 17:07.054
I'm sorry your son sucks so hard.

17:09.108 --> 17:13.193
Thank you, thank you.

17:13.228 --> 17:15.395
Thank you.

17:15.481 --> 17:16.863
Thank you.

17:18.983 --> 17:21.818
We're good, we're good, thanks so much.

17:21.904 --> 17:23.069
Thank you so much.

17:23.155 --> 17:24.704
- Have a great night.
- Appreciate it.

17:24.740 --> 17:27.574
You look beautiful, and
come back and see me.

17:27.626 --> 17:29.793
- Will you come back and see me?
- Yes.

17:29.878 --> 17:31.244
Okay.

17:34.750 --> 17:36.416
Whoo.

17:36.468 --> 17:37.501
Jesus.

17:37.586 --> 17:39.419
I wonder if they own or rent.

17:39.471 --> 17:41.555
Dude, I need to do more cardio.

17:41.590 --> 17:43.006
I'm like, sore already.

17:43.092 --> 17:44.308
Jeez, you know...

17:44.393 --> 17:46.643
Oh, my god!

17:46.729 --> 17:48.595
- Tree man.
- My wig!

17:48.647 --> 17:49.980
Oh, my god.

17:50.065 --> 17:51.431
Thank you, tree man.

17:51.517 --> 17:52.983
Thank you so much.

17:53.068 --> 17:54.434
This is nice.

17:54.486 --> 17:56.353
You're like the giving tree in real life.

17:57.856 --> 17:59.156
All right! Okay.

17:59.241 --> 18:00.407
Hey, hey.

18:00.442 --> 18:03.076
You (Bleep) piece of (Bleep).

18:03.112 --> 18:04.661
I will (Bleep) car.

18:04.747 --> 18:06.029
I will (Bleep).

18:06.115 --> 18:08.532
I'm a tree, (Bleep) damn it.

18:08.617 --> 18:10.701
I was here first, car.

18:10.786 --> 18:12.419
I was here first!

18:12.454 --> 18:15.122
- Thanks for the wig.
- Thanks so much.

18:15.174 --> 18:16.873
Have a good night.

18:21.133 --> 18:23.233
This is the best gift ever!

18:23.236 --> 18:25.436
This is the most powerful
and beautiful blanket

18:25.471 --> 18:27.772
since the AIDS quilt.

18:27.807 --> 18:28.973
Good.

18:29.025 --> 18:31.225
I love pizza, dude.

18:31.310 --> 18:32.276
Me too.

18:32.311 --> 18:35.229
It's a squirrel sleeping bag, unzipped.

18:35.314 --> 18:36.280
Yes, it is.

18:36.315 --> 18:37.565
All right, listen.

18:37.650 --> 18:40.034
So, my family has a tradition on birthdays

18:40.119 --> 18:43.237
where we ask the b-day-ee
a couple questions.

18:43.322 --> 18:44.488
Are you ready?

18:44.540 --> 18:46.907
Ilana,
23-year-old.

18:46.993 --> 18:50.244
What have you done this past
year that you're proud of?

18:50.329 --> 18:53.164
And what are you gonna
do this upcoming year?

18:53.249 --> 18:54.048
Go.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.833
Okay, well...

18:55.885 --> 18:58.919
I am proud of the time I saw
something and said something.

18:59.005 --> 19:00.888
Yeah.

19:00.973 --> 19:04.175
I'm proud that I finally felt a prostate.

19:04.227 --> 19:05.843
It's tricky.

19:05.928 --> 19:08.512
Um... I'm proud that I used a lemon

19:08.598 --> 19:10.931
successfully as antiperspirant.

19:11.851 --> 19:13.184
Whoo, yes I did, yes I did.

19:13.269 --> 19:14.351
Mm-hmm, yeah.

19:14.437 --> 19:18.773
And next year, I want to finish a book...

19:18.858 --> 19:20.024
reading, not writing.

19:20.076 --> 19:24.695
I want to gradually lower
my dosage of antidepressants.

19:24.747 --> 19:26.781
And I want to join ancestry.com.

19:26.866 --> 19:27.932
Oh, I'm in.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.083
- Dude.
- Let's do it.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.167
Okay, how about you?

19:30.203 --> 19:31.418
Well, it's not my birthday.

19:31.504 --> 19:32.870
Come on, it's... I wanna hear it.

19:32.955 --> 19:34.088
Okay. So, this past year,

19:34.173 --> 19:37.675
I'm proud that I finally
finished "Damages," so good.

19:37.710 --> 19:39.510
I really think you need to reconsider TV.

19:39.545 --> 19:41.846
- Nah.
- Um, what else?

19:41.881 --> 19:43.214
I pegged.

19:43.299 --> 19:44.799
Like... ow!

19:44.884 --> 19:46.717
Really outside of my comfort level.

19:46.769 --> 19:48.636
You know. Okay.

19:48.721 --> 19:50.387
I finally masturbated above the covers

19:50.473 --> 19:52.439
without my eyes being closed.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.859
That was a really big journal entry.

19:54.894 --> 19:56.894
Um... when I figured out my eyebrows.

19:56.946 --> 19:59.029
They're sisters, they're not twins.

19:59.065 --> 20:00.114
- Right.
- Need to be treated as such.

20:00.199 --> 20:03.150
Overwhelming pride.

20:03.236 --> 20:07.238
Okay, um, what about next year?

20:07.290 --> 20:08.906
All right.

20:08.958 --> 20:10.490
I'm going to do one legit pull-up,

20:10.526 --> 20:11.693
for real this time.

20:11.811 --> 20:13.278
And I really want to keep a plant alive

20:13.346 --> 20:15.013
for more than two weeks.

20:15.080 --> 20:16.581
You know, I'm going to do that.

20:16.649 --> 20:18.016
Ooh, I forgot one.

20:18.083 --> 20:19.651
I want to see a mangina from behind.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.319
I haven't in years.

20:21.386 --> 20:23.086
What?

20:23.154 --> 20:25.255
A mangina is when a guy pulls
his dick through his legs,

20:25.324 --> 20:26.324
it looks like a vagina.

20:26.391 --> 20:27.625
I know, I know what a mangina is.

20:27.693 --> 20:28.592
What do you mean from behind?

20:28.660 --> 20:29.960
Oh. Oh, I don't know.

20:30.028 --> 20:32.229
It's just, dick head and
balls squishing back there.

20:32.297 --> 20:34.498
It's so cute!

20:34.566 --> 20:36.066
Okay, I have another one.

20:36.134 --> 20:37.968
I want to get one of those
really painful massages

20:38.036 --> 20:40.437
where there's like, an
old Russian woman who like,

20:40.504 --> 20:44.207
slaps huge leaves at you while
you're like, completely naked.

20:44.274 --> 20:48.077
I just feel like I need to
feel more of life's pain.

20:48.145 --> 20:49.278
I hate pain.

20:49.347 --> 20:51.080
I love pleasure.
