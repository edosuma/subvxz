<i>Mine.</i>

02:21.122 --> 02:22.091
Hey there Neville.

02:24.125 --> 02:25.260
How you doin', son?

02:28.430 --> 02:30.129
Yoo hoo!

02:30.131 --> 02:31.366
Hank?

02:32.599 --> 02:34.299
Morning, Mrs. Joiner.

02:34.301 --> 02:36.001
Well how many times am I
going to have to tell you

02:36.003 --> 02:38.270
to call me Martha?

02:38.272 --> 02:40.138
Sorry ma'am, just
don't come natural.

02:40.140 --> 02:43.743
Oh, you Southern boys are just
so gosh darn sweet, aren't you?

02:43.745 --> 02:44.810
Yes ma'am.

02:44.812 --> 02:47.547
Speaking of which, do you
think you could come by

02:47.549 --> 02:51.616
some time this weekend and
help out with a little project?

02:51.618 --> 02:53.286
Yeah, I suppose I could.

02:53.288 --> 02:56.054
Oh, you are just as
sweet as maple syrup.

02:56.056 --> 02:57.756
You have a good day now.

02:57.758 --> 02:59.360
You too, Mrs. Joiner.

03:01.329 --> 03:03.363
That you Hanky Panky?

03:03.365 --> 03:05.231
- Ah, Mr. Joiner.
- Hey!

03:05.233 --> 03:06.465
How'd you hit 'em today?

03:06.467 --> 03:09.067
Ah, as good as my
old wrinkled crank.

03:09.069 --> 03:10.068
Gordon!

03:10.070 --> 03:11.573
What? It's true!

03:12.774 --> 03:14.406
When're we gonna get
you out on the course?

03:14.408 --> 03:16.008
Hank doesn't play golf!

03:16.010 --> 03:17.477
Christ sakes, Romero.

03:17.479 --> 03:18.745
Stop sneaking up
on me like that!

03:18.747 --> 03:21.079
Hey!

03:21.081 --> 03:23.416
English, Romero. You
live in America now.

03:23.418 --> 03:25.317
Don't make me ask
for your papers.

03:25.319 --> 03:26.685
OK, Trump.

03:26.687 --> 03:27.720
You leave him alone.

03:27.722 --> 03:29.721
Romero is just fine.

03:29.723 --> 03:32.058
He's from El Paso.

03:32.060 --> 03:33.326
So he says.

03:33.328 --> 03:35.127
Anyway, I gotta
get back to work.

03:35.129 --> 03:36.397
I'll talk to y'all later.

03:37.098 --> 03:38.567
Alright, Hanky Panky.

03:39.234 --> 03:41.070
See you later,
take it easy.

03:54.748 --> 03:56.085
Slow down!

04:05.259 --> 04:06.425
Can't park there!

04:06.427 --> 04:09.695
Hey, suck it Spank!

04:09.697 --> 04:11.300
I'll have you towed!

04:13.668 --> 04:15.004
Dumbass.

04:50.271 --> 04:51.573
Everything
alright out here?

04:55.142 --> 04:56.778
Everything's just
fine, thanks.

04:58.346 --> 04:59.344
What can I do for you?

04:59.346 --> 05:02.147
Well, I'm just moving in
here and, um, Romero,

05:02.149 --> 05:04.183
I think that's his name,
pointed to your door and

05:04.185 --> 05:07.286
said a big burly strong
man lives in there and

05:07.288 --> 05:09.288
- he'll help you out?
- Pfft.

05:09.290 --> 05:10.822
I reckon he said that as
he got in his truck and

05:10.824 --> 05:12.326
high-tailed it
out of here.

05:13.728 --> 05:15.163
Yeah, something like that.

05:16.697 --> 05:18.466
So how 'bout it,
lend me a hand?

05:19.800 --> 05:21.069
I, uh... I...

05:29.543 --> 05:30.579
Ah, hell.

05:31.545 --> 05:33.312
Alright, just give me
a minute, will you?

05:33.314 --> 05:34.850
Great, I'm just
across the way.

05:41.588 --> 05:42.824
Hey, what's your name?

05:44.259 --> 05:45.427
Hank.

05:46.261 --> 05:47.830
I'm Josie, nice
to meet you Hank.

06:04.646 --> 06:06.245
There we are.

06:06.247 --> 06:07.312
Thank you.

06:07.314 --> 06:09.785
It would've sucked
carrying all those boxes alone.

06:10.785 --> 06:12.187
Pleasure's all mine.

06:16.858 --> 06:18.257
No more furniture?

06:18.259 --> 06:20.461
Nah, it came with a
bed and that's enough.

06:22.262 --> 06:24.296
Looks like you got the...

06:24.298 --> 06:25.700
like a small one, huh?

06:27.634 --> 06:28.469
Huh.

06:33.975 --> 06:35.974
Place is in decent shape.

06:35.976 --> 06:38.777
Yeah, I think it'll
suit me just fine.

06:50.557 --> 06:51.360
Hm.

06:54.495 --> 06:56.628
- Well, I gotta...
- Well, I should...

07:04.906 --> 07:06.872
Nice to meet you, Josie.

07:06.874 --> 07:08.177
Yeah, you too.

07:11.245 --> 07:12.847
If you need anything...

07:13.915 --> 07:15.384
Right over there.

07:17.252 --> 07:18.353
That's right.

07:20.855 --> 07:21.853
See ya.

07:21.855 --> 07:23.457
Take care, Hank.

07:28.562 --> 07:29.830
Settle in, everyone.

07:35.603 --> 07:37.736
Settle in, everyone.

07:37.738 --> 07:39.437
- Gator, please?
- I love you.

07:39.439 --> 07:40.742
Yeah, after class.

07:42.009 --> 07:44.276
Today, we're going to
start working on your

07:44.278 --> 07:47.046
final projects for
the end of the year.

07:47.048 --> 07:49.315
We only have three weeks
left, and you're going to

07:49.317 --> 07:51.386
need every single
one of them.

07:54.021 --> 07:56.788
Hi dear, come on in.

07:56.790 --> 07:58.658
Uh, are you Ms. Elkins?

07:58.660 --> 08:00.929
Yes I am, thank you.

08:01.762 --> 08:04.562
Oh good, everyone we have
a new classmate,

08:04.564 --> 08:05.664
Josephine Walker.

08:05.666 --> 08:07.501
Oh, it's Josie, actually.

08:08.002 --> 08:10.603
Josie, uh, my
name is Josie.

08:10.605 --> 08:11.974
Welcome Josie.

08:13.374 --> 08:14.606
Say welcome.

08:15.843 --> 08:17.446
You can have
a seat, honey.

08:18.812 --> 08:22.514
So, as I was saying, your
project will be done in

08:22.516 --> 08:25.317
pairs and you'll receive
an individual and a

08:25.319 --> 08:27.719
collective grade, so don't
even think about letting

08:27.721 --> 08:29.988
your partner do
all the work.

08:29.990 --> 08:31.293
Name's Marcus.

08:32.392 --> 08:33.260
Hey.

08:34.528 --> 08:35.660
Hey.

08:35.663 --> 08:36.929
You'll also have to
memorize it and act it

08:36.931 --> 08:38.063
out in front of the class.

08:38.066 --> 08:42.767
Okay, I'm going to let you
find your partner, and we

08:42.769 --> 08:45.374
have an even number now
that we have Josie here.

08:50.577 --> 08:51.944
Man, can you
believe this shit?

08:51.946 --> 08:53.315
I don't think I can do it!

08:54.514 --> 08:56.081
Uh, so you want
to be partners?

08:56.083 --> 08:57.849
- What the hell?
- Uh, yeah sure,

08:57.851 --> 08:59.451
but your friend here...

08:59.453 --> 09:00.453
Don't worry
about Gator, okay?

09:00.455 --> 09:01.619
He'll find someone else.

09:01.621 --> 09:02.421
Won't you, Gator?

09:02.423 --> 09:04.390
This is really
fucked up, Marcus.

09:04.392 --> 09:05.360
You'll survive.

09:06.827 --> 09:07.862
Dickhead.

09:08.830 --> 09:09.862
Are you sure that's okay?

09:09.864 --> 09:10.865
Yeah, he'll be fine.

09:14.134 --> 09:17.837
So, guess we got to meet
up outside of here.

09:17.839 --> 09:19.608
Work on this
stupid project.

09:21.008 --> 09:22.543
Yeah, I suppose we do.

09:23.477 --> 09:25.643
Any ideas where
we could go?

09:25.645 --> 09:28.449
I'd offer up my place, but
it ain't right at the moment.

09:29.817 --> 09:31.416
You got a place?

09:31.418 --> 09:33.419
Yeah, I do actually.

09:33.421 --> 09:34.786
Pink Motel, you know it?

09:34.788 --> 09:36.522
Sure do.

09:36.524 --> 09:37.993
Yeah, I'll be
there around 7.

09:51.739 --> 09:52.941
God damn fool.

09:59.514 --> 10:00.514
Put that out Marcus.

10:02.582 --> 10:03.651
Good afternoon, Hank.

10:06.019 --> 10:07.422
You heard me. Put it out.

10:08.022 --> 10:09.424
Oh, this thing?

10:11.658 --> 10:12.693
Mmm.

10:14.061 --> 10:16.027
Cigs ain't cheap.

10:16.029 --> 10:17.131
And I ain't finished.

10:29.710 --> 10:30.679
Now I'm done.

10:46.860 --> 10:47.792
Three...

10:47.794 --> 10:49.094
Two...

10:49.096 --> 10:49.929
One!

10:49.931 --> 10:51.466
Ah, hell!

10:53.000 --> 10:54.168
Mother fuckers!

10:55.769 --> 10:57.136
Fucking shit!

10:57.138 --> 10:58.840
Guess he's having
a shitty day!

10:59.807 --> 11:00.776
Damn it!

11:35.842 --> 11:37.011
Hey Francine.

11:38.245 --> 11:39.648
How you doing?

11:42.549 --> 11:43.717
Yeah, you're right.

11:44.751 --> 11:46.218
I don't have any pants on.

11:46.220 --> 11:47.656
Long story.

13:04.899 --> 13:05.866
Damn.

13:41.235 --> 13:44.902
Well, who might you be,
pretty little thing?

13:44.904 --> 13:46.372
Hey there, I'm Josie.

13:46.374 --> 13:48.040
I just moved in
the other night.

13:48.042 --> 13:49.807
Oh, you're over
in number 11.

13:49.809 --> 13:52.243
The one Hank helped with
all the boxes the other evening.

13:52.245 --> 13:53.411
Yes ma'am.

13:53.413 --> 13:55.180
Yeah, what brings
you to Baymont?

13:55.182 --> 13:56.415
School, actually.

13:56.417 --> 13:58.349
Oh, you're in
the local JC.

13:58.351 --> 13:59.920
Uh, Baymont High.

14:01.087 --> 14:02.820
That right?

14:02.822 --> 14:04.890
See, I figured with you
being in there all by

14:04.892 --> 14:07.925
yourself, you couldn't
still be in high school.

14:07.927 --> 14:12.665
Well, yeah, I am all alone
for now, but um, my mom

14:12.667 --> 14:14.299
and dad are coming
in a couple weeks.

14:14.301 --> 14:16.334
They just wanted me to get
situated before the year

14:16.336 --> 14:17.402
lets out.

14:17.404 --> 14:19.438
Oh, well isn't that nice?

14:19.440 --> 14:21.706
I look forward
to meeting them.

14:21.708 --> 14:23.876
Yeah, I'll make sure to
introduce you when they arrive.

14:23.878 --> 14:26.945
Yeah, well listen, I gotta
run but Gordy and I are

14:26.947 --> 14:28.881
having a cookout this
Sunday to celebrate

14:28.883 --> 14:31.816
Memorial Day and we would
love for you to join us.

14:31.818 --> 14:33.886
Oh, yeah. That sounds great.
I'd love to.

14:33.888 --> 14:36.454
Lovely, I'll see you then.

14:36.456 --> 14:37.759
Mhmm!

14:38.826 --> 14:39.824
<i>There she was, boy.</i>

14:39.826 --> 14:41.993
<i>Peaceful and happy as anybody
ever saw.</i>

14:41.995 --> 14:44.729
<i>Four destroyers running around
and</i> doing about 22 knots.

14:44.731 --> 14:45.930
<i>I thought we didn't want to
radio our positions. Are we</i>

14:45.932 --> 14:46.931
<i>headed for home?</i>

14:46.933 --> 14:48.199
<i>Al is about 6 miles away...</i>

14:52.940 --> 14:55.273
<i>Well he certainly don't belong
anywhere else.</i>

15:01.414 --> 15:02.384
<i>That's right.</i>

15:03.451 --> 15:05.687
<i>No, rode like hell!</i>

15:08.489 --> 15:10.024
<i>Either I'm dead or I'm crazy.</i>

15:10.725 --> 15:11.091
<i>Be that...</i>

15:18.331 --> 15:19.299
Hold up, hold up.

15:20.033 --> 15:21.269
That guy lives here?

15:22.369 --> 15:23.502
Who, Hank?

15:23.504 --> 15:25.170
Yeah.

15:25.172 --> 15:27.506
He's the parking
lot guy at school.

15:27.508 --> 15:29.677
Oh, he is? I didn't know.

15:34.014 --> 15:35.917
I cannot believe you
live next to that guy.

15:36.884 --> 15:39.417
He sits out there all
day in that shitty truck

15:39.419 --> 15:41.889
making sure no one leaves
when they ain't supposed to.

15:50.029 --> 15:53.498
He's been a Goddamn thorn in
my dick since I was a freshman.

15:53.500 --> 15:54.532
He seems nice.

15:54.534 --> 15:56.200
He helped me move in here.

15:56.202 --> 15:58.137
Yeah, well he ain't,
okay? He's a weirdo.

15:58.139 --> 16:00.071
Besides it doesn't even
look like he did much, anyway.

16:00.073 --> 16:02.007
You didn't even
finish moving in.

16:02.009 --> 16:04.778
Sure I am, I got all
I need right here.

16:07.014 --> 16:08.316
Where are your
parents gonna stay?

16:09.482 --> 16:11.719
It's just me,
this is my place.

16:13.254 --> 16:14.520
Alone?

16:14.522 --> 16:15.988
Yup.

16:15.990 --> 16:17.355
I'll be God damned.

16:17.357 --> 16:19.393
That's the coolest fucking
thing I've ever heard of.

16:20.494 --> 16:21.893
You've got your own place?

16:21.895 --> 16:23.228
Mhmm.

16:23.230 --> 16:24.897
No parentals, no
grandparents.

16:24.899 --> 16:25.964
Nope.

16:25.966 --> 16:26.801
Damn.

16:27.735 --> 16:29.267
If this was me, there'd
be a party in this

16:29.269 --> 16:31.369
motherfucker every day.

16:31.371 --> 16:33.939
I dunno about that, but at
least we can have a beer

16:33.941 --> 16:36.108
without anybody
saying shit.

16:36.110 --> 16:37.175
That's what I'm
talking about.

16:37.177 --> 16:38.944
Now that don't mean that
we're gonna get shithoused

16:38.946 --> 16:40.278
or that we aren't gonna
get our work done.

16:40.280 --> 16:43.150
It just means that we
can be grown about it.

16:44.317 --> 16:46.487
Alright, yeah.
Grown, yeah, I like that.

16:47.955 --> 16:49.190
Alright, to being grown.

16:53.927 --> 16:55.996
That is not how grown
people drink their beer.

16:58.331 --> 17:00.335
Then you ain't never
seen my mama drink.

17:07.406 --> 17:09.842
So, how, how the hell does
a girl in high school get

17:09.844 --> 17:10.944
to live on her own?

17:12.346 --> 17:17.215
Uh, well, my dad's in
the military, so he was

17:17.218 --> 17:20.285
stationed all over the
place, and last year when

17:20.287 --> 17:22.421
he got stationed in
Germany, my mama went with

17:22.423 --> 17:26.157
him, but I'd had enough
and they emancipated me.

17:26.160 --> 17:27.392
Damn, that's pretty
cool of them.

17:27.394 --> 17:29.230
Yep, it was.

17:30.130 --> 17:32.100
Anyway, let's get this
work out of the way.

17:52.019 --> 17:53.151
Boo!

17:53.153 --> 17:54.886
Oh, god!

17:54.888 --> 17:57.090
You gonna let me in?
I'm not the boogeyman.

17:59.460 --> 18:02.227
Wow, you let a little girl
frighten you like that?

18:02.229 --> 18:04.328
What kind of
guard are you?

18:04.330 --> 18:06.097
Well, I didn't see you and
you shouldn't be sneaking

18:06.099 --> 18:07.431
up on people
like that anyway.

18:07.433 --> 18:09.537
Oh, relax. It was funny.

18:11.538 --> 18:13.037
Ooh, wow!

18:13.039 --> 18:14.006
What are you doing
out here anyway?

18:14.008 --> 18:15.073
Shouldn't you be in class?

18:15.075 --> 18:16.574
I came to say hey!

18:16.576 --> 18:18.313
Marcus told me you
worked out here.

18:21.214 --> 18:22.280
I see.

18:22.282 --> 18:24.451
Yeah, we got paired up on
a thing on my first day.

18:25.385 --> 18:27.187
It's nice to have a
friend or two already.

18:27.988 --> 18:30.024
Yeah, Marcus.

18:31.157 --> 18:32.292
He's something.

18:34.560 --> 18:35.996
What, you don't like him?

18:37.330 --> 18:41.635
He ain't never been,
let's say, cooperative.

18:42.936 --> 18:44.538
Well, I like him just fine.

18:48.342 --> 18:50.574
So, this is a day
in the office.

18:50.576 --> 18:51.613
Yeah.

18:55.214 --> 18:56.448
Well, could be worse.

18:56.450 --> 18:57.949
It's nice to get to
listen to country music

18:57.951 --> 18:59.153
all afternoon.

19:00.586 --> 19:01.719
You like country?

19:01.721 --> 19:03.087
Of course.

19:03.089 --> 19:04.558
Just the real
stuff, though.

19:05.291 --> 19:08.093
My pop left behind a bunch
of records and my mama

19:08.095 --> 19:11.563
would always play
Carters, Merle, Willy.

19:11.565 --> 19:12.730
Stuff like that.

19:12.732 --> 19:14.969
Say, that's the best.

19:18.172 --> 19:20.008
Your daddy wasn't around
when you was growing up?

19:20.974 --> 19:22.910
Mm, nah, just
me and my mom.

19:24.644 --> 19:26.047
So that drawl.

19:27.347 --> 19:28.582
Texas?

19:29.615 --> 19:31.251
- Yes!
- You got me.

19:33.619 --> 19:35.019
Where you from?

19:35.021 --> 19:36.089
Here and there.

19:37.124 --> 19:38.425
Lived a bunch of places.

19:39.192 --> 19:40.525
Never been to
Texas though.

19:40.527 --> 19:44.465
Yeah, it's a nice place.

19:48.501 --> 19:50.535
So, besides sitting in
this truck all day keeping

19:50.537 --> 19:54.472
all us kids in line, what
else do you do, Hank?

19:54.474 --> 19:55.509
Not a whole lot.

19:56.644 --> 20:01.950
I got these, uh, I got
these tortoises I take care of.

20:02.682 --> 20:06.485
I-I built them a little
home out on my patio.

20:06.487 --> 20:07.488
Really?

20:08.355 --> 20:09.589
That's kind of cool.

20:11.325 --> 20:14.492
And I got this little
drifter too I keep tied up

20:14.494 --> 20:16.260
over at Lake Henry.

20:16.262 --> 20:17.728
I spend most of my
mornings out there in the

20:17.730 --> 20:20.097
quiet, trying
to catch supper.

20:20.099 --> 20:21.132
It's pretty peaceful.

20:21.134 --> 20:22.433
That sounds nice.

20:22.435 --> 20:24.236
I always loved to fish.

20:24.238 --> 20:26.404
Well, we'll have to get you
out there one day.

20:26.406 --> 20:27.538
I'd like that.

20:27.540 --> 20:29.207
Heh.

20:29.209 --> 20:32.046
Hey, are you going to the
Joiner's cookout this weekend?

20:34.480 --> 20:35.680
Cookout?

20:35.682 --> 20:37.585
Yeah, to celebrate
Memorial Day.

20:38.352 --> 20:40.421
Oh, yeah right, uh...

20:42.423 --> 20:44.488
I g.. I...

20:44.490 --> 20:46.391
Yeah, we'll see.

20:46.393 --> 20:48.794
You should come. It'll be fun.

20:48.796 --> 20:52.497
Yeah maybe I,
maybe I will. Maybe I will.

20:52.499 --> 20:56.802
Alright, well, you enjoy
the rest of your day doing

20:56.804 --> 20:58.773
whatever it is
you do out here.

21:29.536 --> 21:30.602
- Romero!
- Hey!

21:30.604 --> 21:32.571
A drink for you, enjoy.

21:32.573 --> 21:33.674
Gracias!

21:35.375 --> 21:38.176
And for you, my
dear, a virgin drink.

21:38.178 --> 21:39.276
Oh, come on.

21:39.278 --> 21:40.444
It's just for liability.

21:40.446 --> 21:41.681
There's hooch in there.

21:46.686 --> 21:47.819
Christmas
Eve, '67.

21:47.821 --> 21:51.222
In country, yeah, about
a month before the Tet began.

21:51.224 --> 21:53.424
A group of us were in our
bunks, playing cards,

21:53.426 --> 21:55.326
drinking whiskey, trying
to forget that we're not

21:55.328 --> 21:58.763
home for Christmas, and
some of the guys are

21:58.765 --> 21:59.831
really hammered.

21:59.833 --> 22:02.400
And you know me, we're
going to lighten the mood,

22:02.402 --> 22:03.601
or try.

22:03.603 --> 22:06.371
So I look over at the bluest
son of a bitch in the room.

22:06.373 --> 22:08.405
And I go "Hey
Jimmy, Jesus!

22:08.407 --> 22:11.209
Don't look so sad, there
is no way Santa's gonna

22:11.211 --> 22:13.344
thaw his pecker in time
to nail your wife!"

22:14.847 --> 22:16.547
- Yeah.
- That never gets old.

22:16.549 --> 22:19.453
They got a laugh out of that.
Except, of course, Jimmy.

22:20.453 --> 22:23.354
Poor bastard got his legs
blown off a few days later.

22:23.356 --> 22:24.355
Wow...

22:24.357 --> 22:25.356
To Jimmy!

22:25.358 --> 22:26.525
- Yeah, to Jimmy.
- To Jimmy!

22:26.527 --> 22:28.593
Who needs
another cold one?

22:28.595 --> 22:30.862
I'll take one
too, Mrs. Joiner.

22:30.864 --> 22:34.298
Well slap my ass
and call me Sally!

22:34.300 --> 22:36.267
Hanky Panky at a
social gathering!

22:36.269 --> 22:37.236
Hey!

22:37.238 --> 22:40.604
I uh, I hope y'all don't
mind me dropping by.

22:40.606 --> 22:42.274
- No!
- No, of course not!

22:42.276 --> 22:44.479
We're glad you could
make it for once.

22:45.311 --> 22:47.179
Come on, you.

22:47.181 --> 22:47.879
Take it easy.

22:47.881 --> 22:49.784
Relax for a while, okay?

22:54.387 --> 22:55.620
Hey Hank.

22:55.622 --> 22:56.621
Hey Josie.

22:56.623 --> 22:57.956
It's nice to see you here.

22:57.958 --> 22:59.727
Joiners said you never
show to these things.

23:01.394 --> 23:02.826
Sometimes, I guess.

23:02.828 --> 23:05.332
Well, I'm glad you did because I
have a surprise for you.

23:06.400 --> 23:07.235
Alright.

23:14.407 --> 23:15.375
What is it?

23:16.309 --> 23:17.342
What do you mean
"what is it?"

23:17.344 --> 23:18.546
What's it look like?

23:19.479 --> 23:22.279
I dunno, some sort
of stadium, I guess.

23:22.281 --> 23:23.547
Hell yes it is.

23:23.549 --> 23:25.385
A turtle racing stadium.

23:26.819 --> 23:28.353
Where'd you get it?

23:28.355 --> 23:29.222
I made it.

23:30.757 --> 23:32.259
No shit?

23:33.559 --> 23:34.726
Well what the hell
are you waiting for?

23:34.728 --> 23:36.430
Go get those suckers.

23:37.463 --> 23:39.597
Come on, you
lazy son of a bitch!

23:39.599 --> 23:41.298
I put good money on you!

23:41.300 --> 23:43.301
What'd I tell you about
gambling, Gordon?

23:43.303 --> 23:44.401
Oh will you
shut up, Martha?

23:44.403 --> 23:45.303
It's a friendly wager.

23:45.305 --> 23:46.638
Hank, did you give
me a defective one?

23:46.640 --> 23:47.771
The fucking
thing won't move!

23:47.773 --> 23:48.875
Go!

23:49.776 --> 23:51.008
You picked him.

23:51.010 --> 23:52.611
C'mon Francine. Keep moving.

23:52.613 --> 23:53.777
There you go sweetheart.

23:53.779 --> 23:54.778
There you go,
look at this.

23:54.780 --> 23:56.381
Alright... This turtle.

23:56.383 --> 23:58.719
This turtle is
a Goddamn idiot!

23:59.853 --> 24:01.318
Oh, who's gonna win?

24:01.320 --> 24:02.519
- Here we go.
- Neville!

24:02.521 --> 24:03.755
Turn around!

24:03.757 --> 24:05.923
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

24:05.925 --> 24:09.561
This turtle is
a fucking idiot!

24:09.563 --> 24:11.528
It's over, it's over!

24:11.530 --> 24:12.596
Oh, you stupid
fucking turtle!

24:12.598 --> 24:14.899
Everyone knows the female
tortoise is the fastest.

24:14.901 --> 24:17.701
No one asked you.

24:17.703 --> 24:20.904
And the winner of the
first annual Pink Motel

24:20.906 --> 24:26.344
Memorial Day Turtle Race is
Hank and his tortoise Francine.

24:27.713 --> 24:31.519
Francine! Francine! Francine!

24:32.685 --> 24:33.817
I never raced 'em before.

24:33.819 --> 24:35.420
I had no idea
they'd do it.

24:35.422 --> 24:36.720
Yeah, well they didn't
have to do much.

24:36.722 --> 24:38.657
Just go toward some food.

24:38.659 --> 24:41.660
Yeah, but with all the
hootin' and hollerin' I

24:41.662 --> 24:43.295
thought they
might get scared.

24:43.297 --> 24:46.331
Well, Gordy's did but that's
just because of his cussing.

24:46.333 --> 24:48.900
Listen, this race
was clearly rigged.

24:48.902 --> 24:51.005
- Hanky Panky here...
- Please don't call me that.

24:52.939 --> 24:54.639
Huh?

24:54.641 --> 24:56.811
Please don't call
me Hanky Panky.

24:58.345 --> 24:59.680
I can't stand it.

25:02.682 --> 25:05.318
Oh for Christ's sakes, why
didn't you say so earlier.

25:08.788 --> 25:09.720
Hey, Josie!

25:09.722 --> 25:11.291
Oh, I think that's for me.

25:12.358 --> 25:15.526
Alright, I'm off.

25:15.528 --> 25:17.062
Thank you so much Martha
and Gordy, I had a

25:17.064 --> 25:17.997
wonderful time.

25:17.999 --> 25:20.364
Oh, you're more than
welcome, sweetheart.

25:20.366 --> 25:22.633
What, a-are you sure
you have to leave?

25:22.635 --> 25:23.735
She's talking
to that fuckin' weirdo.

25:24.837 --> 25:28.340
We can go and get some,
some ice cream or something.

25:28.342 --> 25:29.841
Oh Hank, let her go
with her friends.

25:29.843 --> 25:32.313
She's been with the
grown ups long enough.

25:36.549 --> 25:38.482
Y'all have a nice night.
Thanks again.

25:38.484 --> 25:39.619
Alright, g'night!

25:55.969 --> 25:57.434
She's a sweet girl.

25:57.436 --> 25:58.503
Mm.

25:58.505 --> 25:59.703
Yeah, she is.

25:59.705 --> 26:01.775
Yeah, she is, she's...

26:03.609 --> 26:06.076
She's the, uh, kind of
girl that could make a

26:06.078 --> 26:09.948
grown man have to go
around and knock on all

26:09.950 --> 26:12.449
the doors in the
neighborhood, if you know

26:12.451 --> 26:13.688
what I'm saying.

26:14.821 --> 26:17.956
You don't have to specify,
so they don't know if, uh,

26:17.958 --> 26:20.458
if you were touching the
no-no zone on some little

26:20.460 --> 26:24.027
kid or doing
the

26:24.029 --> 26:27.931
with some hottie who
could've been 18, but uh...

26:27.933 --> 26:29.002
Wasn't.

26:30.470 --> 26:34.405
Either way, well it's...
it's not a good look.

26:34.407 --> 26:36.074
Alright, Mr. and
Mrs. Joiner.

26:36.076 --> 26:37.542
Thank you.

26:37.544 --> 26:39.510
I really enjoyed myself.

26:39.512 --> 26:40.911
Thanks for
coming by, Hank.

26:40.913 --> 26:42.514
Make a habit of it.

26:42.516 --> 26:44.449
Good night, Hank.

26:44.451 --> 26:45.653
God bless America.

26:49.990 --> 26:53.728
Yeah, God bless America.

27:03.804 --> 27:04.839
Oh!

27:09.509 --> 27:10.975
Alright, crack open that
case, Gator, and let's get

27:10.977 --> 27:12.177
this show on the road.

27:12.179 --> 27:13.748
Fuck yeah, fuck yeah.

27:15.481 --> 27:17.981
Right, now Josie, tonight
there ain't none of that

27:17.983 --> 27:20.718
shit about being grown,
okay, or drinking like a

27:20.720 --> 27:22.519
lady or a gentleman.

27:22.521 --> 27:23.654
Me and Gator here are
going to show you how to

27:23.656 --> 27:24.622
drink like a local.

27:24.624 --> 27:26.224
Oh, alright, let's see it.

27:26.226 --> 27:27.859
C'mon.

27:27.861 --> 27:28.992
Here's to you and me.

27:28.994 --> 27:30.961
And best friends
we'll always be.

27:30.963 --> 27:32.729
But if we ever disagree,

27:32.731 --> 27:33.834
Fuck you!

27:40.173 --> 27:42.105
And here's to me!

27:42.107 --> 27:43.708
Hey, fuck you.

27:43.710 --> 27:45.075
You got the jump on me.

27:45.077 --> 27:47.745
Bullshit, Gator.
I beat you fair and square.

27:47.747 --> 27:49.480
Alright, it's your turn.

27:49.482 --> 27:50.451
Alright.

27:52.251 --> 27:54.651
Y'all need someone to show
you how this is done proper.

27:55.821 --> 27:56.689
Yeah, right.

27:57.557 --> 27:58.558
What's the bet?

27:59.625 --> 28:02.794
Uh, well if either of us
win, you gotta, you gotta

28:02.796 --> 28:04.863
suck face with us.

28:04.865 --> 28:05.863
Both of you?

28:05.865 --> 28:06.965
Just the winner.

28:06.967 --> 28:07.998
That fair, Gator?

28:08.000 --> 28:08.999
Yeah.

28:09.001 --> 28:10.969
Alright, and
what if I win?

28:10.971 --> 28:12.573
Uh, your call.

28:13.973 --> 28:17.845
If I win, you both
have to feel me up.

28:20.513 --> 28:22.247
Under or over the bra.

28:22.249 --> 28:24.082
Doesn't matter to me.

28:24.084 --> 28:25.186
Okay.

28:26.286 --> 28:27.153
Go.

28:34.861 --> 28:36.997
And that is how
a local does it.

28:38.731 --> 28:42.633
Well, um, who's first?

28:42.635 --> 28:43.703
Up to y'all.

28:45.605 --> 28:49.073
- Aw, shit!
- Heh, aw, you sucker.

28:49.075 --> 28:50.510
I'm going under.

28:52.278 --> 28:53.480
Alright, nope.

28:54.079 --> 28:55.880
Both of y'all didn't
try to beat me.

28:55.882 --> 28:58.048
So the bet is
null and void.

28:58.050 --> 28:59.116
Oh, what the fuck?

28:59.118 --> 29:00.186
Why'd you stop me?

29:01.688 --> 29:05.088
You hear me? We could've been
touching on her titties!

29:05.090 --> 29:07.292
Yeah, I hear you
buddy, I hear you.

29:18.305 --> 29:19.105
Josie.

29:20.339 --> 29:22.141
Uh, you wanna smoke?

29:22.808 --> 29:24.575
Uh, yeah sure.

29:24.577 --> 29:25.846
Here you go.

29:30.884 --> 29:32.016
So what about you?

29:32.018 --> 29:32.917
What's your deal?

29:32.919 --> 29:34.153
Oh, me? Shit.

29:35.087 --> 29:36.656
Nothing really.

29:37.123 --> 29:38.855
Yeah, I ain't
come from much.

29:38.857 --> 29:40.760
And probably ain't gonna
be much neither.

29:41.627 --> 29:42.893
I don't mind though.

29:42.895 --> 29:44.130
I keep it simple.

29:48.634 --> 29:50.671
See, I like to hunt
and drink beer.

29:52.105 --> 29:53.673
I like women, whiskey.

29:54.207 --> 29:57.645
I like, uh, drinking beer
and whiskey while I hunt.

29:59.045 --> 30:01.015
And I also like to
get drunk and fish.

30:01.914 --> 30:02.913
So you like hunting?

30:02.915 --> 30:05.115
Hell yeah.

30:05.117 --> 30:07.987
Shit, I killed a snake
with my bare hands one time.

30:08.887 --> 30:09.821
Bullshit.

30:09.823 --> 30:10.889
Word to mother.

30:10.891 --> 30:12.826
Just picked it up and
snapped the fucker's neck.

30:13.993 --> 30:14.825
That's gross.

30:14.827 --> 30:15.860
What, you don't
like killing things?

30:15.862 --> 30:16.861
Uh uh.

30:16.863 --> 30:17.894
Not even fish?

30:17.896 --> 30:19.232
Not even fish.

30:20.032 --> 30:21.834
But to each his
own, and all that.

30:23.903 --> 30:26.807
Y'know, Hank likes to fish
out on that lake a lot.

30:29.108 --> 30:31.077
I don't really give a
fuck what that guy does.

30:33.680 --> 30:35.249
He might take me for
a ride some time.

30:40.353 --> 30:41.589
Lemme get a cig.

30:46.226 --> 30:50.030
So, what y'all
talking about?

30:50.829 --> 30:52.430
Ah, she was just telling
that her friend Hank has a

30:52.432 --> 30:53.631
little boat or something.

30:53.633 --> 30:55.970
She was fixin' to go for a
ride with him out on the lake.

30:57.871 --> 31:01.672
Well, Jesus Josie, I
wouldn't go by myself

31:01.674 --> 31:03.674
anywhere with that creep.

31:03.676 --> 31:06.779
Especially on a lake.
You can't go nowhere.

31:07.380 --> 31:08.446
Why not?

31:08.448 --> 31:10.381
Well, I've heard some
stories about what he did

31:10.383 --> 31:13.116
- before he got here.
- Like what?

31:13.118 --> 31:16.022
Mutilating dead bodies and
doing freak shit with 'em.

31:17.757 --> 31:20.424
That's why he keeps to himself,
so he don't do it again.

31:20.426 --> 31:22.994
What, you think they'd
hire someone at the school

31:22.996 --> 31:24.228
if he did shit like that?

31:24.230 --> 31:25.930
Well, obviously he
didn't get caught.

31:25.932 --> 31:27.832
Y'all get wrapped up in
gossip like a couple of

31:27.834 --> 31:28.833
school girls.

31:28.835 --> 31:30.938
We've been here a lot
longer than you, okay?

31:31.704 --> 31:33.374
There's just something
ain't right with him.

31:46.752 --> 31:48.052
<i>There she is!</i>

31:48.054 --> 31:50.020
<i>With that pack of
destroyers behind her.</i>

31:50.022 --> 31:51.288
<i>We've got enough bombs
here to give those guys</i>

31:51.290 --> 31:52.789
<i>some trouble.</i>

31:52.791 --> 31:54.225
<i>Yeah, it'd be
fun, wouldn't it?</i>

31:54.227 --> 31:58.196
<i>No, this is a job for
headquarters to figure out.</i>

31:58.198 --> 32:00.167
<i>What are you
trying to do? Be a hero?</i>

32:03.803 --> 32:05.303
<i>Quit waiting for a turn!</i>

32:05.305 --> 32:07.037
<i>Well how do you like that?</i>

32:07.039 --> 32:08.840
<i>Two weeks ago you'd have
gone after the whole fleet!</i>

32:08.842 --> 32:10.408
Well, it's been real guys.

32:10.410 --> 32:11.776
Thanks for taking me out.

32:11.778 --> 32:12.610
Oh yeah.

32:12.612 --> 32:15.011
Yeah, we gotta
redo that bet, too.

32:15.013 --> 32:17.047
Deal, I'll talk
to y'all later.

32:17.049 --> 32:19.750
Hey Josie, um...

32:19.752 --> 32:21.084
Seeing that we don't have
school tomorrow, you

32:21.086 --> 32:23.323
wanna, you wanna do
something with me?

32:24.190 --> 32:26.423
I mean, just like
hang out or whatever?

32:26.425 --> 32:28.025
Yeah, that'd be nice.

32:28.027 --> 32:29.326
Yeah, alright, I
mean without Gator?

32:29.328 --> 32:31.295
The fuck am I supposed
to do tomorrow?

32:31.297 --> 32:33.463
- Yeah, I know what you mean.
- Alright.

32:33.465 --> 32:35.232
Alright, pick me
up around two?

32:35.234 --> 32:37.070
- Alright, you got it.
- Okay.

32:46.779 --> 32:47.478
<i>Maybe you'd
better fix yourself a cup</i>

32:47.480 --> 32:48.716
<i>of coffee, huh?</i>

32:49.449 --> 32:50.417
<i>No!</i>

32:58.423 --> 32:59.492
Oh, Hank!

33:00.359 --> 33:01.394
Oh, hey.

33:07.400 --> 33:08.435
I was just...

33:10.537 --> 33:13.036
Heading out to the store.

33:13.038 --> 33:14.240
This late?

33:15.008 --> 33:17.177
Yeah, all out of uh...

33:18.243 --> 33:21.179
Coffee and milk for the morning.

33:21.181 --> 33:23.314
Ah, necessities.

33:23.316 --> 33:24.418
Absolutely.

33:29.454 --> 33:30.888
How was your night?

33:30.890 --> 33:33.257
Good, thank you. How was yours?

33:33.259 --> 33:34.428
Yeah, it was fine.

33:38.263 --> 33:40.099
Hey, I wanted to, um...

33:42.035 --> 33:43.804
I wanted to thank you.

33:45.305 --> 33:47.037
For what?

33:47.039 --> 33:48.307
For the race earlier.

33:50.108 --> 33:51.410
Y'know, building
that stadium.

33:54.180 --> 33:56.113
That's the nicest thing
someone's done for me

33:56.115 --> 33:57.416
in a while.

34:03.623 --> 34:05.025
It meant something.

34:08.126 --> 34:09.458
Ah, don't sweat it.

34:09.460 --> 34:14.065
It was fun, and those
tortoises are so cute.

34:15.969 --> 34:17.436
That's what I was
trying to tell you.

34:21.940 --> 34:24.342
Hey, when am I gonna see
that habitat of yours?

34:25.643 --> 34:27.878
Any time you want, really.

34:27.880 --> 34:30.384
Well, I would love to see
what you've built for 'em.

34:31.217 --> 34:33.985
Well, you can come now
and see if you'd like.

34:33.987 --> 34:35.454
Yeah, I'd like that.

34:36.989 --> 34:41.092
But, um, you know I've had
a few too many and I need

34:41.094 --> 34:45.364
to get some sleep,
so, rain check?

34:46.498 --> 34:50.233
Oh, yeah.

34:50.235 --> 34:52.004
Alright.

34:54.206 --> 34:55.338
Night, then.

34:55.340 --> 34:56.940
G'night.

34:56.943 --> 34:58.312
Drive safe.

36:00.239 --> 36:02.173
<i>Hank?</i>

36:02.175 --> 36:03.610
<i>Get out here!</i>

36:23.096 --> 36:24.695
I think someone's
mad with you, Hank.

36:24.697 --> 36:27.465
But don't worry, fuckin'
Columbo here is on the case.

36:27.467 --> 36:28.699
Oh, I hate that show.

36:28.701 --> 36:30.237
That's not my point.

36:33.773 --> 36:35.675
Who the hell would
do this to you, Hank?

36:36.742 --> 36:38.476
I have no idea.

36:38.478 --> 36:40.313
Hm.

36:41.481 --> 36:42.516
Spank.

36:44.650 --> 36:46.650
You know it, it
is kind of funny.

36:52.324 --> 36:53.490
You know, like
spank spank?

36:53.492 --> 36:55.191
Alright, c'mon,
knock that off Romero.

36:55.193 --> 36:56.059
Alright, just go get
something to help clean

36:56.061 --> 36:57.094
this off.

36:57.096 --> 36:58.329
Si, old Gor.

36:58.331 --> 37:00.164
Sorry Spank. I mean Hank!

37:03.436 --> 37:05.135
The hell is going
on out here?

37:05.137 --> 37:07.708
Oh, uh, nothing.

37:08.708 --> 37:10.242
I'm on my way to
the course I'll...

37:12.277 --> 37:13.312
I'll see y'all later.

37:18.583 --> 37:19.618
Oh.

37:20.820 --> 37:22.322
Well that's not very nice.

37:23.789 --> 37:25.057
I'm gonna go get ready.

37:26.559 --> 37:27.527
Big day planned?

37:32.731 --> 37:34.333
Gonna head over
to the marina.

37:36.469 --> 37:37.570
I like boats.

37:38.771 --> 37:40.173
Yeah, they got those.

37:41.474 --> 37:43.807
Little bit beat up, but,
you should check it out

37:43.809 --> 37:45.112
some time.

37:46.344 --> 37:48.612
Well, have a good one.

37:48.614 --> 37:49.715
Enjoy your day.

37:52.617 --> 37:53.719
Hey, Hank?

37:57.255 --> 37:58.591
Want some company?

38:20.112 --> 38:20.878
Sorry.

38:20.880 --> 38:22.215
It's Marcus.

38:22.882 --> 38:24.217
Marcus.

38:26.885 --> 38:28.721
Oh, look. La Tortuga.

38:30.188 --> 38:31.521
Hey, you should buy it.

38:31.523 --> 38:35.628
Well, maybe in a past life.

38:36.561 --> 38:38.230
I don't need it now.

38:39.532 --> 38:41.632
That where you hide
all them dead bodies?

38:41.634 --> 38:43.467
Huh?

38:43.469 --> 38:45.802
There's some rumors about
you at school, you know.

38:45.804 --> 38:47.807
About your past and stuff.

38:49.541 --> 38:52.309
No one knows about me
before I came here.

38:52.311 --> 38:53.878
Then why do I hear some
shit about you and

38:53.880 --> 38:55.449
dead bodies?

38:57.215 --> 38:59.385
You ought to rethink
who you hang with.

39:00.385 --> 39:02.154
Well, I told him
it wasn't true.

39:04.422 --> 39:06.392
So, what did
you do before?

39:07.760 --> 39:11.862
Well, I wasn't cutting
corpses, but I did do

39:11.864 --> 39:14.568
something kind of
weird, I guess.

39:15.835 --> 39:18.538
Don't feel good to think
about it so I don't.

39:19.605 --> 39:20.606
Like what?

39:24.876 --> 39:26.880
I lived in Huntsville,
Texas. You know it?

39:27.914 --> 39:29.213
Never heard of it.

39:29.215 --> 39:30.617
Didn't think you would.

39:32.818 --> 39:34.121
Small place.

39:34.920 --> 39:35.989
Unremarkable.

39:37.322 --> 39:39.623
But there's a prison there
that executes more people

39:39.625 --> 39:41.527
than anywhere else
in the country.

39:43.762 --> 39:46.699
I started working there
when I was just 20 years old.

39:49.534 --> 39:51.137
Just a regular guard.

39:55.240 --> 39:57.541
Then they put me on
the tie-down team.

39:57.543 --> 39:59.376
What's that?

39:59.378 --> 40:00.881
Just as it sounds, really.

40:01.746 --> 40:03.847
We was responsible for
securing the inmate to the

40:03.849 --> 40:07.952
gurney, tying down the
straps, making sure he

40:07.954 --> 40:09.289
couldn't move.

40:10.356 --> 40:14.691
IV's would go in, the
shade would fly up so the

40:14.693 --> 40:16.529
people that came
to see could watch.

40:18.264 --> 40:20.463
Last words were said.

40:20.465 --> 40:24.802
Then this doctor hits the
switch and we just watched

40:24.804 --> 40:29.276
a man or woman take
their last breath.

40:33.778 --> 40:35.912
Jesus, that's heavy.

40:35.914 --> 40:38.282
Yeah.

40:38.284 --> 40:39.552
It was a heavy job.

40:44.824 --> 40:46.193
Why'd you leave?

40:50.028 --> 40:51.764
Found out we
killed someone...

40:56.034 --> 40:57.703
Who shouldn't
have been killed.

41:03.576 --> 41:05.778
First time the government
ever admitted that happened.

41:08.347 --> 41:09.583
Really?

41:10.615 --> 41:13.784
I feel like you always
hear about DNA or whatever

41:13.786 --> 41:16.353
getting people
off death row.

41:16.355 --> 41:19.055
Yeah, off death row.

41:19.057 --> 41:22.762
Can't dig someone
up and say "sorry."

41:25.498 --> 41:26.630
Was it recent?

41:26.632 --> 41:28.731
Nah, it happened
years ago.

41:28.733 --> 41:31.869
But the evidence came to
pass just a few years back.

41:31.871 --> 41:33.373
That guy we killed?

41:34.974 --> 41:35.642
Shit.

41:38.010 --> 41:39.846
I just couldn't
forget no more.

41:42.380 --> 41:43.947
I packed my bags, I threw
'em in the truck and I

41:43.949 --> 41:46.383
drove and drove
and drove 'til I...

41:46.385 --> 41:47.954
'til I felt like quitting.

41:50.922 --> 41:51.991
Landed here.

41:53.958 --> 41:55.027
Stayed.

41:57.730 --> 41:59.396
I can't...

41:59.398 --> 42:02.700
can't even imagine what
it was like watching all

42:02.702 --> 42:04.471
those people die.

42:06.338 --> 42:07.806
I wish I couldn't either.

42:11.876 --> 42:13.012
C'mon, let's
get out of here.

42:14.713 --> 42:15.614
Yeah.

42:26.092 --> 42:28.592
Hey, thanks for
bringing me along.

42:28.594 --> 42:29.929
I really enjoyed it.

42:31.530 --> 42:32.666
Yeah, me too.

42:33.532 --> 42:34.865
The sun's still out.

42:34.867 --> 42:36.032
Why don't we lay around
the pool for a little bit

42:36.034 --> 42:37.636
when we get back?

42:40.505 --> 42:42.606
Ah, well, I'm not much
of a pool guy.

42:42.608 --> 42:44.778
C'mon, it's no fun
out there all alone.

42:48.914 --> 42:50.750
I suppose a little sun
wouldn't hurt none.

43:11.436 --> 43:13.706
Oh, hell no. I ain't doing it.

43:16.141 --> 43:17.676
Christ, you gotta...

43:30.688 --> 43:31.824
Here we go now.

43:32.824 --> 43:33.992
Here we go.

43:38.963 --> 43:40.032
Oh, hey there.

43:40.965 --> 43:42.000
Hey.

43:45.003 --> 43:46.373
Feels nice out
here, doesn't it.

43:47.873 --> 43:48.875
Yeah.

43:50.443 --> 43:51.678
It is.

43:54.914 --> 43:55.845
Oh.

43:55.847 --> 43:57.583
I never come out here.

44:02.655 --> 44:07.093
It's nice you can just let
everything slip away and just...

44:08.193 --> 44:09.962
Just relax.

44:13.731 --> 44:15.065
Yeah.

44:15.067 --> 44:16.467
That sounds good.

44:16.469 --> 44:18.037
I-I could use some of that.

44:21.873 --> 44:23.706
Those swim trunks get any
shorter and you'll be

44:23.708 --> 44:26.476
ready for a European
beach party.

44:26.478 --> 44:28.747
Yeah, eh...

44:30.148 --> 44:33.717
If you're going to have
some kind of illegal sex

44:33.719 --> 44:35.952
relationship with someone
who is not of age, you

44:35.954 --> 44:38.121
don't rub everybody's
nose in it.

44:38.123 --> 44:40.557
God damn it, Martha!

44:40.559 --> 44:41.891
We talked about this.

44:41.893 --> 44:42.992
Just mind your
own business.

44:42.994 --> 44:44.494
Well how can I?

44:44.496 --> 44:46.162
Look at them, there is
no discretion at all?

44:46.164 --> 44:48.065
Maybe that's the point. There's
nothing to hide.

44:48.067 --> 44:50.833
Oh, or they're hiding
in plain sight.

44:50.835 --> 44:53.737
Oh boy, they're hiding in
plain sight and you caught 'em.

44:53.739 --> 44:55.204
Will you let me
watch the game?

44:55.206 --> 44:56.673
...go for a
ride on your boat?

44:56.675 --> 44:58.141
Well, "boat" is a
bit of a stretch.

44:58.143 --> 44:59.275
Oh, well,
whatever it is.

44:59.277 --> 45:00.476
Let's go for an
evening ride.

45:00.478 --> 45:03.914
Alright, I-I'll pick
you up tomorrow around nine.

45:03.916 --> 45:05.048
Yoo-hoo!

45:05.050 --> 45:06.885
- Shit...
- Oh, hey Martha.

45:08.686 --> 45:10.019
Good afternoon
Mrs. Joiner.

45:10.021 --> 45:12.688
I saw you two out here
lounging and I thought

45:12.690 --> 45:14.023
you'd might
like a beverage.

45:14.025 --> 45:15.861
Oh, thank you.

45:16.829 --> 45:18.295
That's mighty kind of you.

45:18.297 --> 45:19.898
Oh, it's nothing.

45:20.900 --> 45:23.833
So, what are you
two chatting about?

45:23.835 --> 45:24.934
Oh, excuse me dear.

45:24.936 --> 45:26.269
Oh, we were just
talking about...

45:26.271 --> 45:27.304
No, just some
school stuff.

45:27.306 --> 45:29.539
There's been some
break-ins in the parking lot

45:29.541 --> 45:30.807
and that kind of thing.

45:30.809 --> 45:32.008
That sounds terrible.

45:32.010 --> 45:33.110
It is?

45:33.112 --> 45:34.545
Well, did you
catch 'em any?

45:34.547 --> 45:36.713
Not yet, but I plan too.

45:36.715 --> 45:38.017
Oh.

45:42.221 --> 45:43.755
Well, I'd better
get going.

45:44.789 --> 45:45.889
Thank you for
the beverage.

45:45.891 --> 45:47.090
Oh, sure.

45:47.092 --> 45:48.791
So soon, Hank?

45:48.793 --> 45:54.567
Yeah, I got, uh, I got
some, I got some stuff.

45:59.804 --> 46:02.171
Well you have a good
afternoon, Hank.

46:02.173 --> 46:03.842
You too.

46:18.090 --> 46:19.856
Psst! Hanky Panky!

46:19.858 --> 46:21.691
Uh, sorry. Sorry. Habit.

46:21.693 --> 46:24.061
Hank, uh, hey.

46:24.063 --> 46:28.164
Where do we stand
on that, uh...

46:28.166 --> 46:30.166
favor I asked
you to do for me?

46:30.168 --> 46:31.735
Still working on
it, Mr. Joiner.

46:31.737 --> 46:33.172
Oh.

46:34.273 --> 46:35.871
Flowers, huh?

46:35.873 --> 46:37.209
Big night tonight?

46:39.110 --> 46:41.144
Just for the house.

46:41.146 --> 46:42.282
See ya.

49:13.831 --> 49:16.099
Hank, hey.

49:16.101 --> 49:17.269
Oh, hey.

49:21.440 --> 49:24.374
Maybe I, Maybe
I'm overdressed.

49:24.376 --> 49:26.943
I can go and change,
it'll take me just a sec.

49:26.945 --> 49:28.411
Hey,
what's up Hank?

49:35.920 --> 49:37.052
Who's that?

49:39.291 --> 49:40.891
It's Marcus.

49:40.893 --> 49:42.559
Listen, um...

49:42.561 --> 49:44.795
I'm sorry, I-I can't.

49:44.797 --> 49:45.896
I can't hang out tonight.

49:45.898 --> 49:48.000
I've got this
thing with him.

49:49.902 --> 49:51.101
Um...

49:51.103 --> 49:52.405
Some other night?

49:57.309 --> 49:58.478
Oh.

49:59.978 --> 50:01.313
Oh, yeah.

50:06.585 --> 50:08.019
Those for me?

50:12.056 --> 50:13.824
Yeah, I...

50:13.826 --> 50:17.295
I just thought they might
brighten up your place.

50:18.329 --> 50:19.295
That's sweet.

50:19.297 --> 50:20.766
They're beautiful.

50:21.365 --> 50:23.769
I'll, uh. I'll
get 'em in some water.

50:25.503 --> 50:26.905
Have a good night.

52:13.010 --> 52:14.010
Hey! Hank!

52:14.012 --> 52:15.181
Not now.

52:45.077 --> 52:49.448
You know, if uh, if you ever
need to talk about anything...

52:52.451 --> 52:53.452
I...

52:55.052 --> 52:56.188
Hank, that's
a knife.

52:59.391 --> 53:02.161
Oh Hank, Hank, they're
just, they're just kids. Hank!

53:56.313 --> 53:57.382
<i>Hank?</i>

54:06.090 --> 54:07.159
Can I come in, Hank?

54:23.809 --> 54:25.378
Oh, no thank you.

54:36.188 --> 54:38.356
You sittin' at my table,
you're gonna drink with me.

54:53.237 --> 54:54.804
What can I do for you?

54:54.806 --> 54:56.305
Well, Hank.

54:56.307 --> 54:58.508
Me and Gordy are
worried for you.

54:58.510 --> 54:59.478
That so?

55:00.445 --> 55:02.144
We've been living by
you for a few years now.

55:02.146 --> 55:05.115
We don't know that
much about you.

55:05.117 --> 55:07.286
I guess some of that's
changed lately.

55:09.153 --> 55:10.887
What you think
you know about me?

55:10.889 --> 55:13.155
Actually, Josie filled us
in a little bit about what

55:13.157 --> 55:15.191
you did before
you came here.

55:15.193 --> 55:16.729
At the prison.

55:17.762 --> 55:19.565
That was awfully
kind of her.

55:20.331 --> 55:22.731
Sounds to me like a rough
way to make a living, Hank.

55:22.733 --> 55:24.233
No, not really.

55:24.235 --> 55:25.869
We killed the people
that killed the people.

55:25.871 --> 55:27.537
It was that
simple, really.

55:27.539 --> 55:29.405
To be around death
all the time.

55:29.407 --> 55:32.708
To watch life leave
another person's body.

55:32.710 --> 55:35.445
Hell, it's gotta mess with
anyone between the ears,

55:35.447 --> 55:37.483
if you know what I mean?

55:38.916 --> 55:42.552
I appreciate you and Mr.
Joiner's concern, but

55:42.554 --> 55:46.155
I know what my job was and
what I had to do and all,

55:46.157 --> 55:48.891
so if you came here to
rehash it, I don't mean to

55:48.893 --> 55:51.728
be rude, but I ain't got
much interest in it.

55:51.730 --> 55:54.396
I'm not here to
rehash anything.

55:54.398 --> 55:57.266
I'm just here to say that
it might be good for you

55:57.268 --> 56:00.105
to, you know,
get some help.

56:03.340 --> 56:04.773
I'll be just fine.

56:04.775 --> 56:06.277
I appreciate
y'all's concern.

56:07.878 --> 56:09.315
One more thing.

56:14.552 --> 56:16.521
Now, I'm sure you're
lonely, Hank.

56:17.289 --> 56:19.923
No one likes to feel
lonely in this world.

56:19.925 --> 56:23.592
Without a companion, no
one to care for you or you them.

56:23.594 --> 56:26.896
But a young girl, Hank,
that is not the answer.

56:26.898 --> 56:29.802
She is in high school
and it would be illegal.

56:32.938 --> 56:34.706
You think that's
what's going on?

56:35.539 --> 56:38.240
I'm not saying
anything is going on.

56:38.242 --> 56:40.409
I'm just old enough to
know what it means when a

56:40.411 --> 56:43.213
man looks at a girl the
way you look at Josie.

56:43.215 --> 56:46.218
And it ain't right for a
girl to lead a man on, either.

56:47.418 --> 56:49.219
I don't know all the
details, but I do know

56:49.221 --> 56:51.454
you're not crazy to think
that there's a chance I'm

56:51.456 --> 56:54.193
just here to tell
you not to do it.

57:04.603 --> 57:06.672
You ain't got to
worry about that.

57:10.474 --> 57:11.844
We're friends.

57:16.447 --> 57:18.917
I've been just looking
after her is all.

57:19.818 --> 57:20.819
Good.

57:32.264 --> 57:33.695
You have a
pleasant evening.

57:33.697 --> 57:34.933
You too.

57:47.612 --> 57:49.912
<i>Hank, you motherfucker!</i>

57:49.914 --> 57:51.546
<i>I'm gonna gut your ass!</i>

57:51.548 --> 57:52.914
I know you're in there
you motherfucker!

57:52.916 --> 57:54.650
- Come out here!
- Marcus, calm down.

57:54.652 --> 57:55.918
C'mon, just
forget about it.

57:55.920 --> 57:56.719
Forget about it?

57:56.721 --> 57:59.289
That creep slashed
my fuckin' tire!

57:59.291 --> 58:00.289
<i>Those are for
muddin', too! They ain't normal</i>

58:00.291 --> 58:02.791
- <i>fuckin' tires!</i>
- <i>Marcus, please, let's go.</i>

58:02.793 --> 58:04.327
<i>You're
dead, Spank? You hear me?</i>

58:04.329 --> 58:05.195
You're fuckin' dead!

58:05.197 --> 58:06.429
You're being a fucking
creep, Marcus.

58:06.431 --> 58:07.563
Just calm down, c'mon.

58:07.565 --> 58:09.801
I'll give you a ride home. I'll
give you a ride home.

58:13.838 --> 58:14.807
Yeah, alright.

58:17.409 --> 58:18.744
This ain't over, Spank!

58:20.545 --> 58:22.780
<i>You hear me, you
corpse-fucking freak?</i>

58:33.958 --> 58:36.425
Well, I'm real sorry
about your truck.

58:36.427 --> 58:37.762
Yeah, me too.

58:38.663 --> 58:39.697
Fucker.

58:41.365 --> 58:43.333
Other than that, though.

58:43.335 --> 58:44.603
It was a hell of a night.

58:45.936 --> 58:47.373
Yeah it was.

58:49.039 --> 58:50.308
Yeah.

58:57.681 --> 58:59.682
So, about an hour okay?

58:59.684 --> 59:01.420
- Yeah.
- You'll be there?

59:03.454 --> 59:04.956
Yeah, yeah. I'll be there.

59:10.661 --> 59:11.693
You kissin' her?

59:11.695 --> 59:12.494
Yeah.

59:12.496 --> 59:14.930
Oh, fuckin' lucky
son of a bitch.

59:14.932 --> 59:16.566
Just wait 'til I tell
you what else we did.

59:16.568 --> 59:18.501
Oh, get the fuck out!

59:18.503 --> 59:20.068
Yeah, smell my
fuckin fingers.

59:20.070 --> 59:21.440
Oh.

59:22.639 --> 59:23.805
Yeah, you're sick!

59:44.929 --> 59:46.429
Who is it?

59:46.431 --> 59:47.800
It's Josie.

01:00:06.951 --> 01:00:08.454
Can I come in?

01:00:10.755 --> 01:00:12.624
I don't feel much
like talking.

01:00:15.726 --> 01:00:16.929
Me neither.

01:00:18.929 --> 01:00:20.598
But, um...

01:00:23.735 --> 01:00:26.936
You got that whiskey right
there and, I still haven't

01:00:26.938 --> 01:00:32.809
seen your habitat so I
figured we could go sit

01:00:32.811 --> 01:00:34.780
with the turtles
and have a drink?

01:00:49.726 --> 01:00:53.531
Wow, it looks
amazing out here.

01:00:59.471 --> 01:01:01.470
Oh, there he is!

01:01:01.472 --> 01:01:02.972
Can I pick him up?

01:01:02.974 --> 01:01:04.606
Go ahead.

01:01:04.608 --> 01:01:06.744
Oh, God damn gorgeous.

01:01:09.213 --> 01:01:11.146
Is this the boy
or the girl?

01:01:11.148 --> 01:01:12.617
That's a girl.

01:01:13.184 --> 01:01:14.920
What's her name again?

01:01:17.722 --> 01:01:18.924
Francine.

01:01:19.958 --> 01:01:21.860
That's a funny name
for a tortoise.

01:01:23.094 --> 01:01:25.161
Naming a tortoise anything
is pretty funny if you

01:01:25.163 --> 01:01:26.731
think about it.

01:01:36.907 --> 01:01:37.976
No no, no.

01:01:38.976 --> 01:01:40.510
- Sit here.
- You sure?

01:01:40.512 --> 01:01:41.647
No, please.

01:01:53.891 --> 01:01:55.460
Can I get some of that?

01:02:18.148 --> 01:02:20.051
You a God-fearing
man, Hank?

01:02:21.552 --> 01:02:22.587
Nah.

01:02:23.521 --> 01:02:25.990
Ain't never really
had no use for a god.

01:02:28.092 --> 01:02:29.758
What about in that room
where you watched all

01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:31.697
those people die?

01:02:38.001 --> 01:02:39.605
Ain't no god in there.

01:02:42.673 --> 01:02:44.775
Even with the priest
reading his rites?

01:02:47.878 --> 01:02:48.980
No.

01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:59.054
You know, in school when I
was little, they used to

01:02:59.056 --> 01:03:02.157
teach us about
God, heaven, hell.

01:03:02.159 --> 01:03:03.995
All that.

01:03:05.063 --> 01:03:06.662
And I'd tell my
mama about it.

01:03:06.664 --> 01:03:09.197
About what I learned and
how I wanted to go to

01:03:09.199 --> 01:03:11.702
heaven and be with
Jesus and God.

01:03:16.974 --> 01:03:18.809
And you know what
she'd say to me?

01:03:22.914 --> 01:03:28.320
She'd say "Josie
there ain't no god.

01:03:30.755 --> 01:03:32.921
And even if there is, he's
a fucked up asshole who

01:03:32.923 --> 01:03:35.561
ain't never done
right by you or me."

01:03:41.231 --> 01:03:44.168
And I'd just
look up at her.

01:03:46.269 --> 01:03:49.137
These big wide eyes not
even sure what all the

01:03:49.139 --> 01:03:50.908
words really meant.

01:03:52.409 --> 01:03:57.947
Eventually I learned
though, but not a day goes

01:03:57.949 --> 01:04:00.686
by that I don't think
about what she said to me.

01:04:04.054 --> 01:04:05.123
You believe her?

01:04:06.657 --> 01:04:07.659
I don't know.

01:04:09.059 --> 01:04:12.662
Don't care so much either,
I guess, just something

01:04:12.664 --> 01:04:14.600
that always stuck with me.

01:04:16.034 --> 01:04:17.269
Where's she at now?

01:04:19.871 --> 01:04:20.939
Dead.

01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:25.009
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:04:28.378 --> 01:04:29.614
Me too.

01:04:33.317 --> 01:04:34.885
You slash out
Marcus' tire?

01:04:36.753 --> 01:04:38.289
He ain't that
bad of a guy.

01:04:40.157 --> 01:04:43.025
Y'all just need to sit
down and have a beer and

01:04:43.027 --> 01:04:45.293
straighten out whatever's
been going on with you two.

01:04:45.295 --> 01:04:47.131
What's going on lately?

01:04:47.998 --> 01:04:49.166
With you?

01:04:58.175 --> 01:05:00.645
I took the liberty.

01:05:05.382 --> 01:05:07.316
Thanks for coming, Marcus.

01:05:07.318 --> 01:05:08.851
No problem.

01:05:08.853 --> 01:05:11.454
Hank, I asked Marcus here
so you two could talk

01:05:11.456 --> 01:05:14.155
about whatever's been
going on and maybe come to

01:05:14.157 --> 01:05:16.027
some sort of an agreement?

01:05:17.795 --> 01:05:20.365
I believe Marcus has
a few things to say.

01:05:21.766 --> 01:05:23.034
Yeah, well, uh.

01:05:24.768 --> 01:05:29.140
Sorry I call you Spank and
that I messed with your truck.

01:05:32.809 --> 01:05:33.844
And?

01:05:35.012 --> 01:05:36.181
And your boat.

01:05:37.882 --> 01:05:38.680
That wasn't right.

01:05:38.682 --> 01:05:40.251
I'll stop messing
with your stuff.

01:05:41.753 --> 01:05:42.788
Thank you.

01:05:43.755 --> 01:05:44.756
Hank?

01:06:01.873 --> 01:06:03.708
Sorry about your tire.

01:06:07.277 --> 01:06:08.480
I'll replace it.

01:06:13.416 --> 01:06:16.020
Hope we can stay out
of each other's way.

01:06:16.987 --> 01:06:18.322
Sure we can.

01:06:19.891 --> 01:06:21.425
But I'll be over here
sometimes though.

01:06:23.795 --> 01:06:25.130
Think we can be civil?

01:06:30.467 --> 01:06:32.069
I don't see why not.

01:06:35.373 --> 01:06:36.938
Alright.

01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:38.509
That extend to school too?

01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:41.012
Yeah, it does.

01:06:42.813 --> 01:06:43.914
I appreciate that.

01:06:47.485 --> 01:06:48.516
See?

01:06:48.518 --> 01:06:49.952
Wasn't so hard.

01:06:49.954 --> 01:06:51.323
Let's seal it
with a drink.

01:06:52.190 --> 01:06:53.325
Sit, I've got it.

01:07:02.032 --> 01:07:03.534
Catch anything good
out on the lake?

01:07:04.501 --> 01:07:05.536
Good enough.

01:07:07.237 --> 01:07:12.344
I can... I can get
dinner for a few days.

01:07:17.447 --> 01:07:18.581
You fish?

01:07:18.583 --> 01:07:20.152
Yeah.

01:07:21.018 --> 01:07:22.521
Yeah, I also like to hunt.

01:07:34.297 --> 01:07:35.466
To détente.

01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:37.802
Hm?

01:07:38.501 --> 01:07:39.570
Cheers?

01:07:53.951 --> 01:07:55.052
What you hunt?

01:07:55.619 --> 01:07:57.186
Whatever.

01:07:57.188 --> 01:07:58.289
If it breathes
I'll kill it.

01:08:05.329 --> 01:08:06.364
I got this a while back.

01:08:15.438 --> 01:08:16.573
Dear lord.

01:08:21.345 --> 01:08:22.413
Lemme take a look at that.

01:08:27.283 --> 01:08:28.452
What a beautiful...

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:29.854
Yeah.

01:08:37.060 --> 01:08:38.261
So beautiful.

01:08:39.363 --> 01:08:40.465
Mm.

01:08:44.135 --> 01:08:45.301
It's so...

01:10:02.579 --> 01:10:04.215
Any last words?

01:10:34.677 --> 01:10:35.613
Hank.

01:10:57.201 --> 01:10:58.168
It's okay.

01:10:58.769 --> 01:11:00.238
Don't struggle.

01:11:18.555 --> 01:11:19.757
Oh no...

01:11:23.493 --> 01:11:27.264
Picture was snapped
17 years ago on my 4th birthday.

01:11:39.777 --> 01:11:41.712
They took him away
three months later.

01:11:49.420 --> 01:11:52.056
Guess I just
got used to it.

01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:00.329
Next six years or so we'd
visit him a few times a

01:12:00.331 --> 01:12:06.738
month and tell him
what was going on.

01:12:08.572 --> 01:12:13.144
How my school project
went, how my soccer game was.

01:12:16.514 --> 01:12:17.879
My daddy was in jail.

01:12:17.881 --> 01:12:19.583
It just became normal.

01:12:27.423 --> 01:12:29.726
He wasn't home
but he was alive.

01:12:36.332 --> 01:12:38.569
And then he wasn't
even that anymore.

01:12:49.313 --> 01:12:51.115
I watched you
strap him down.

01:12:54.652 --> 01:12:55.752
Yeah.

01:12:56.753 --> 01:12:59.287
My mama probably didn't
use the best judgment

01:12:59.289 --> 01:13:01.455
bringing me there, but
she wanted me to see what

01:13:01.457 --> 01:13:03.161
y'all were
gonna do to him.

01:13:04.828 --> 01:13:06.297
To an innocent man.

01:13:13.369 --> 01:13:19.641
She leaned over and
whispered in my ear,

01:13:19.643 --> 01:13:22.846
"Those men are all cowards."

01:13:45.002 --> 01:13:48.306
Then they asked him if
he had any last words.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.801
Do you remember
what he said?

01:14:23.707 --> 01:14:26.711
"To all of you
that put me here."

01:14:33.350 --> 01:14:38.756
"You will meet a fate
far worse than this."

01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:44.328
Keep going.

01:14:50.434 --> 01:14:56.306
"You will suffer in ways you
never thought possible."

01:15:06.649 --> 01:15:08.853
"That I promise you."

01:15:34.545 --> 01:15:36.346
What are you seeing, Hank?

01:15:42.051 --> 01:15:43.320
Nothing.

01:15:48.725 --> 01:15:50.527
You ain't a bad guy.

01:15:57.768 --> 01:16:00.704
Truth is, I know
you're actually sorry.

01:16:05.809 --> 01:16:10.347
I know it torments
you. It eats at you.

01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:19.724
The others I've done...

01:16:20.890 --> 01:16:23.625
They just went on
with their lives.

01:16:23.627 --> 01:16:26.431
They got off on
what they did.

01:16:27.398 --> 01:16:29.100
Sick fucks.

01:16:34.537 --> 01:16:37.541
But I've made sure
daddy's words came true.

01:16:39.842 --> 01:16:41.378
They've suffered.

01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:52.789
Same goes for anyone
I do after this.

01:17:11.641 --> 01:17:12.943
Not you.

01:17:17.146 --> 01:17:18.548
No suffering.

01:17:20.716 --> 01:17:22.483
Just peace.

01:18:16.139 --> 01:18:18.576
<i>I bled out in
under two minutes.</i>

01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:35.626
<i>She set up Marcus
pretty bad.</i>

01:18:36.527 --> 01:18:37.795
<i>I mean, look at the scene.</i>

01:18:39.128 --> 01:18:42.166
<i>He's going to have a hard time
explaining he didn't kill me.</i>

01:18:55.578 --> 01:18:57.881
<i>Martha and Gordy were
asked to give a statement.</i>

01:18:59.917 --> 01:19:02.250
<i>Gordy, he told 'em some
stuff about what was going</i>

01:19:02.252 --> 01:19:05.986
<i>on with me and
Josie and Marcus.</i>

01:19:05.988 --> 01:19:09.125
<i>The pranks and...
Well, shit.</i>

01:19:11.295 --> 01:19:15.065
<i>How I lusted after Josie and
was jealous of her and Marcus.</i>

01:19:22.005 --> 01:19:23.673
<i>I ain't sure
where I'm at now.</i>

01:19:24.274 --> 01:19:27.278
<i>There ain't something,
but there ain't nothing either.</i>

01:19:33.684 --> 01:19:36.116
<i>I got no malice towards
Josie, or whatever her</i>

01:19:36.118 --> 01:19:38.285
<i>name is, for what she did.</i>

01:19:38.287 --> 01:19:41.656
<i>I mean, all them years I
took part in evening the</i>

01:19:41.658 --> 01:19:43.857
<i>score for the
state of Texas.</i>

01:19:43.859 --> 01:19:45.693
<i>But when we settled one
that wasn't meant to be</i>

01:19:45.695 --> 01:19:48.632
<i>settled, nothing
happened to us.</i>

01:19:51.001 --> 01:19:52.737
<i>She's just
rectifying that.</i>

01:20:03.846 --> 01:20:05.813
<i>And as for Josie...</i>

01:21:21.024 --> 01:21:22.456
May I help you?

01:21:22.458 --> 01:21:23.827
Whiskey.

01:21:45.981 --> 01:21:47.350
Good afternoon, Miss.

01:21:48.952 --> 01:21:49.951
You gonna
just sit there, or

01:21:49.953 --> 01:21:51.422
are you gonna
buy me a drink?

01:21:52.988 --> 01:21:54.923
Hey Stump, get us a couple
of whiskeys and a couple

01:21:54.925 --> 01:21:56.293
of brews, huh?

01:21:59.296 --> 01:22:00.798
Name's Matthew.

01:22:02.498 --> 01:22:04.868
Nice to meet you
Matthew, I'm Francine.

01:22:06.069 --> 01:22:08.303
Well, welcome
to Huntsville.
