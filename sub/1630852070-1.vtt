00:01.535 --> 00:03.635
(gentle music)

00:08.376 --> 00:10.943
(gentle music)

00:20.621 --> 00:21.587
(birds chirping)

00:21.689 --> 00:24.323
(mysterious music)

00:38.539 --> 00:41.273
(van door closes)

00:41.375 --> 00:43.108
(van door rumbles)

00:43.210 --> 00:44.476
- hey. We're home.

00:48.249 --> 00:48.847
Careful.

01:10.938 --> 01:12.738
So what do you think?

01:13.707 --> 01:14.807
This is your room.

01:17.011 --> 01:17.910
Do you like it?

01:30.724 --> 01:32.124
- [news anchor] her mother
on the south side of the park

01:32.226 --> 01:33.258
near the woods for several hours

01:33.360 --> 01:35.344
before the incident occurred.

01:35.463 --> 01:37.362
Police could find no
trace of the young girl

01:37.465 --> 01:40.032
nor any clues to
her whereabouts.

01:40.134 --> 01:41.333
Anybody with-
(television clicks)

01:41.435 --> 01:43.135
(television chattering)

01:43.237 --> 01:45.070
- that's not you anymore.

01:45.773 --> 01:47.272
Your name is sophie.

01:49.210 --> 01:50.509
And you're my little girl.

01:57.118 --> 02:00.085
You're going to like it here.

02:00.187 --> 02:02.221
I promise to give
you the best life.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.430
- Essentially,
what I'm saying is,

02:11.532 --> 02:12.998
although the past
events of your childhood

02:13.100 --> 02:14.833
shape your cognitive changes,

02:15.736 --> 02:17.536
they don't dictate your future.

02:18.839 --> 02:20.906
And what if someone
has never experienced

02:21.008 --> 02:23.942
any traumatic events in
their life to overcome?

02:24.044 --> 02:28.580
I would say consider
yourself very lucky.

02:29.934 --> 02:32.518
As always, this is alyssa
manning, daring to be.

02:34.588 --> 02:37.122
(alyssa sighs)

02:38.125 --> 02:39.658
I can help you with the math.

02:39.760 --> 02:42.261
All right, remember
when you carry the two,

02:42.363 --> 02:43.896
you work from right to left.

02:43.998 --> 02:44.863
- Mm-hm.
- I think that's it.

02:44.965 --> 02:45.964
- Hello.

02:47.134 --> 02:48.667
- Hi. We're back here.

02:48.769 --> 02:51.103
- I just stopped by to say
hello to my two favorite people

02:51.205 --> 02:52.905
and to find a home for
my new batch of cookies.

02:53.007 --> 02:54.206
You guys know anyone interested?

02:54.308 --> 02:55.574
- [both] me.

02:55.676 --> 02:56.642
- After your homework.

02:56.744 --> 02:57.876
- Ah, no fun, mom.

02:57.978 --> 02:58.777
(grace laughs)

02:58.879 --> 03:00.112
(alyssa laughs)

03:00.214 --> 03:02.080
- I told grace I'm big
enough for a real babysitter

03:02.183 --> 03:03.849
so she doesn't always
have to watch me.

03:03.951 --> 03:06.351
- And I told her that I
don't have to do anything.

03:06.453 --> 03:07.953
We stick together. Always have.

03:08.055 --> 03:09.588
- Even if I wanted to have
a stranger babysit you,

03:09.690 --> 03:10.923
auntie grace would never let me.

03:11.025 --> 03:12.724
- That's right, because
babysitters just text

03:12.826 --> 03:13.892
their boyfriends all night.

03:13.961 --> 03:15.827
They don't have fun
like we do, right?

03:15.930 --> 03:17.262
- Right.
(alyssa chuckles)

03:17.364 --> 03:18.564
- oh, you're still good
for tomorrow night, right?

03:18.666 --> 03:19.565
I've got that live show.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.366
- Yep, I'll be here.

03:21.468 --> 03:24.136
Any plans for after the show?

03:24.238 --> 03:26.104
- You're bad.
- Well?

03:26.207 --> 03:26.939
- Maybe.
(grace squeals)

03:27.041 --> 03:28.240
(grace laughs)

03:28.342 --> 03:30.008
- I know what you guys
are talking about.

03:30.110 --> 03:30.676
(alyssa gasps)

03:30.778 --> 03:31.410
- emma!

03:31.512 --> 03:32.311
(grace laughs)

03:32.413 --> 03:33.212
- I'll see you guys tomorrow.

03:33.314 --> 03:34.446
- Bye.
- Bye.

03:34.548 --> 03:36.915
- You. Let's get
back to that math.

03:37.017 --> 03:38.183
(crickets chirping)

03:38.252 --> 03:40.152
you've been asking me to do
a show together for years.

03:40.254 --> 03:41.820
- I have.

03:41.922 --> 03:42.955
As a true crime fanatic,

03:43.057 --> 03:46.358
I've always been
fascinated with your case.

03:46.460 --> 03:48.694
Being taken right in
front of your own parents,

03:48.796 --> 03:51.129
I mean, it struck fear
into parents everywhere.

03:51.215 --> 03:52.931
- And with my other
announcement tonight,

03:53.033 --> 03:54.933
I thought it was the right
time to take spencer up

03:55.035 --> 03:56.501
on his idea to flip the script

03:56.604 --> 03:58.637
and have him ask
me a few questions.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.606
- First of all, the obvious,

04:00.708 --> 04:03.775
what was it like being
rescued and returned safely

04:03.877 --> 04:06.311
to your parents
after seven years?

04:06.413 --> 04:09.281
- Well, it definitely
took some time to adapt,

04:09.383 --> 04:11.817
but eventually, I fell
back into my life.

04:13.621 --> 04:17.189
And I had relatively
normal high school years.

04:17.291 --> 04:20.058
The attention
eventually waned and-

04:20.160 --> 04:22.094
- you then took that experience
and devoted your life

04:22.196 --> 04:24.963
to studying psychology
and human behavior.

04:25.065 --> 04:26.865
And now, look at you,

04:26.951 --> 04:29.067
you're one of the most
celebrated personalities

04:29.169 --> 04:30.569
in the podcast world.

04:30.671 --> 04:34.473
And today, 25 years
after your safe return,

04:34.558 --> 04:36.775
I understand you have
a big announcement?

04:36.844 --> 04:40.112
- Yes, the rumors are true,
I'm releasing my first book.

04:40.214 --> 04:43.048
A personal memoir dealing
with the kidnapping.

04:44.918 --> 04:46.485
It's a long time coming.

04:46.587 --> 04:48.420
- Should we take some live
questions from the listeners?

04:48.522 --> 04:49.221
- Yes.

04:52.393 --> 04:55.527
(people chattering)

05:02.703 --> 05:05.203
in my case, I lived
out this horrific event

05:05.306 --> 05:06.772
in the public eye,

05:06.874 --> 05:08.473
so I not only had to
deal with the trauma,

05:08.575 --> 05:10.092
but I had to deal with
the fame and attention

05:10.210 --> 05:11.843
that came with
being little alyssa.

05:13.180 --> 05:16.014
- That flew by. It's
been a wonderful show.

05:16.116 --> 05:18.950
There is just one last
thing we haven't touched on.

05:19.053 --> 05:21.086
- I think I know where
you're going with this.

05:21.188 --> 05:23.955
- Sorry, but I think
everyone would like to know.

05:25.125 --> 05:27.359
The man who kidnapped
you, miles simon,

05:27.461 --> 05:29.361
will be released
from prison tomorrow.

05:30.831 --> 05:31.963
How does that make you feel?

05:34.134 --> 05:35.467
- He served his time,

05:35.569 --> 05:39.204
and I hope he used
the 25 years to heal,

05:42.609 --> 05:44.543
and that he'll never
harm anyone else again.

05:46.080 --> 05:49.948
- Doesn't scare you or upset
you that he's a free man?

05:52.453 --> 05:54.586
- This has been great.
Thank you, spencer.

05:54.688 --> 05:55.887
- Thank you.

05:55.989 --> 05:57.556
- And thank you
all for joining us.

05:57.658 --> 06:00.425
As always, this is alyssa
manning, daring to be.

06:02.629 --> 06:03.428
Great.
(sarah clapping)

06:03.530 --> 06:04.329
(sarah squeals)

06:04.431 --> 06:05.964
- what a great show, guys.

06:06.066 --> 06:07.265
- Yeah, we'll have
to do it again.

06:07.368 --> 06:08.533
- I'm gonna hold you to that.
(both chuckling)

06:08.635 --> 06:10.235
- thank you.
- Thank you.

06:11.638 --> 06:13.105
(alyssa sighs)
- thank you so much.

06:13.207 --> 06:14.206
(sarah chuckles)

06:14.308 --> 06:15.140
- bye.

06:16.009 --> 06:18.510
(tense music)

06:18.612 --> 06:21.780
- [miles] you're my little girl.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.716
(mysterious music)

06:24.785 --> 06:25.717
- are you okay?

06:27.755 --> 06:28.987
- Yeah.

06:29.089 --> 06:30.622
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

06:30.724 --> 06:33.024
(bag zips)

06:33.127 --> 06:34.526
first copy?

06:34.628 --> 06:35.827
- It's not final.

06:35.929 --> 06:37.462
And we still need those
last edits from you,

06:37.564 --> 06:39.664
but I figured with
the rushed release,

06:39.767 --> 06:41.733
we could whet the
public's appetite.

06:41.835 --> 06:45.203
Besides, what would a book
announcement be without a book?

06:45.305 --> 06:47.572
This was brave.
I'm proud of you.

06:47.674 --> 06:50.409
- Hey, it was your idea to
incorporate the old journals.

06:50.511 --> 06:52.711
That was smart.
It really sold me.

06:54.281 --> 06:56.481
And I appreciate you pushing
me when things got tough.

06:56.583 --> 06:57.482
- It's my job.

06:59.052 --> 07:00.185
And with miles's release,

07:00.287 --> 07:02.354
we can expect an avalanche
of media attention

07:02.456 --> 07:04.423
and endless interview requests.

07:04.525 --> 07:05.791
- I was afraid of that.

07:05.893 --> 07:07.392
- Well, I have a game plan.

07:07.494 --> 07:08.560
- I guess you're at
the house so much,

07:08.662 --> 07:10.595
you know my and emma's
schedule by now.

07:11.899 --> 07:13.298
- Yeah, you could say that.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.267
Hey, I gotta run, but I'll
see you in a couple days

07:15.369 --> 07:16.701
for the release
strategy meeting?

07:16.804 --> 07:18.170
- Yes, you will.

07:18.272 --> 07:19.538
Sarah?

07:19.623 --> 07:21.173
- Yeah?

07:21.275 --> 07:22.874
- I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

07:24.077 --> 07:26.111
- No, it's okay.

07:26.213 --> 07:29.014
I knew it was hard on you
being assigned a new editor,

07:29.116 --> 07:30.849
especially under
the circumstances.

07:31.718 --> 07:32.784
Caroline was great,

07:32.886 --> 07:34.886
and I know you trusted
her and her vision.

07:34.988 --> 07:38.123
I'm just glad you gave
me and my ideas a chance.

07:38.225 --> 07:39.324
- Thank you, again.

07:40.727 --> 07:44.329
I'm going to clean some things
up around here. Goodnight.

07:44.431 --> 07:46.998
- Okay. Bye.

07:47.100 --> 07:50.435
- [news anchor] footage of
miles simon, now 62 years old,

07:50.537 --> 07:53.038
walking out of
prison a free man.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.340
Simon served 25
years for kidnapping

07:55.442 --> 07:58.109
alyssa manning
over 30 years ago.

07:58.212 --> 07:59.945
He released a statement
care of his lawyer-

08:00.047 --> 08:00.745
(television clicks)

08:00.848 --> 08:02.397
she tried to wait up.

08:02.516 --> 08:04.966
(grace chuckles)

08:05.085 --> 08:07.486
(grace sighs)

08:09.022 --> 08:11.022
sorry, I was watching the news.

08:12.125 --> 08:13.225
I found out some info.

08:14.094 --> 08:15.427
As part of his probation,

08:15.529 --> 08:17.729
miles will be placed in a
temporary living complex

08:17.831 --> 08:21.666
and given a part time job,
probably something janitorial.

08:21.768 --> 08:24.703
And there will, of course, be
a restraining order in effect.

08:25.539 --> 08:26.872
(alyssa sighs)

08:26.974 --> 08:29.407
you okay? You need
me to stay over?

08:29.510 --> 08:30.976
- No, I'm fine.

08:31.078 --> 08:33.945
Thank you, I don't know
what I would do without you.

08:34.047 --> 08:34.913
- Of course.

08:36.216 --> 08:37.983
You sure you're
okay to be alone?

08:38.085 --> 08:39.317
- Well...

08:39.419 --> 08:41.453
- Oh, gotcha.

08:41.555 --> 08:42.320
And I'm out.

08:42.422 --> 08:44.055
(grace chuckles)

08:44.157 --> 08:45.023
have fun.
- Thanks.

08:45.125 --> 08:48.159
Goodnight.
(grace chuckles)

08:49.229 --> 08:51.196
hello. Come on, baby,
let's go to bed.

08:53.951 --> 08:56.535
(gentle music)

08:58.405 --> 09:01.273
(cellphone chimes)

09:08.248 --> 09:09.748
(crickets chirping)

09:09.850 --> 09:11.449
- so the only good thing

09:11.535 --> 09:13.985
about my crazy long work
hours is they coincide

09:14.071 --> 09:15.654
with your alone time.

09:15.756 --> 09:16.655
Hi.
- Hi.

09:24.631 --> 09:27.299
I knew this day was coming,
but now that it's here,

09:28.635 --> 09:30.802
I haven't really
processed it all.

09:30.904 --> 09:34.105
- Mm. Was he even
allowed to contact you?

09:34.207 --> 09:35.373
- He's not supposed to.

09:36.209 --> 09:38.043
But I don't know what to expect.

09:40.113 --> 09:42.480
Am I hypocritical for not giving
him a chance to apologize?

09:42.583 --> 09:44.416
- No.
- I mean, I'm always preaching

09:44.518 --> 09:46.851
about forgiveness and
letting go of the past.

09:46.954 --> 09:48.687
- I think this is
a little different.

09:48.789 --> 09:49.921
- One thing's for sure,

09:51.358 --> 09:52.724
there will be reporters in
the front lawn tomorrow.

09:52.826 --> 09:53.858
(alyssa sighs)

09:53.961 --> 09:56.261
- well, I can stay with
you for a few days?

09:57.631 --> 09:58.363
- What about emma?

10:00.667 --> 10:01.333
- What about emma?

10:03.170 --> 10:04.269
Look, alyssa,

10:07.874 --> 10:09.774
I don't know if I'm sending
all the right signals here,

10:09.876 --> 10:13.578
but I am crazy about you.

10:17.551 --> 10:20.118
- Your signals are
landing just fine.

10:20.220 --> 10:23.822
- Okay, well, if we're gonna
have a future together,

10:23.924 --> 10:27.492
then I know that that
future will include emma,

10:28.662 --> 10:30.996
so we can't continue to
grow if I'm not involved

10:31.098 --> 10:33.164
with the most important
part of your life.

10:34.534 --> 10:35.834
- I know.

10:35.936 --> 10:38.236
- If I'm gonna be
around for a while,

10:38.338 --> 10:40.338
emma's gonna realize that
I'm more than your friend

10:40.440 --> 10:42.807
who stops by to fix
things around the house.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.077
- Gonna be around for a while?

10:48.815 --> 10:50.248
- I'd like to be.

10:51.718 --> 10:53.218
- I'd like that too.

10:59.559 --> 11:00.191
- [emma] mommy?

11:01.395 --> 11:03.561
- Honey, what are you doing up?

11:03.664 --> 11:05.864
- I tried to wait up for you.

11:05.966 --> 11:08.933
- I know. You
remember grant, right?

11:09.036 --> 11:10.335
My friend who...

11:11.672 --> 11:14.305
Well, grant's just here to
spend some time with me.

11:15.142 --> 11:17.709
- Hi, emma. It's
good to see you.

11:17.811 --> 11:20.645
- Hi. Can I hang
out with you guys?

11:20.747 --> 11:21.880
- Honey, let's get
you back to bed.

11:21.982 --> 11:24.549
- She can hang out
for a bit, right?

11:24.651 --> 11:25.850
We're just about
to start a movie.

11:25.952 --> 11:27.419
- Sure, yeah. Come on.

11:27.521 --> 11:28.687
- [grant] come.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.992
(grant chuckles)

11:34.094 --> 11:36.895
(remote clicks)

11:40.701 --> 11:43.234
(birds chirping)

11:45.372 --> 11:48.573
(children chattering)

11:51.778 --> 11:52.877
- [miles] hi, alyssa.

11:57.017 --> 11:59.551
You wanna take a walk with me?

12:06.660 --> 12:09.561
(suspenseful music)

12:22.642 --> 12:23.475
- alyssa?

12:28.882 --> 12:29.948
Alyssa?!

12:32.986 --> 12:33.785
Alyssa?!

12:34.988 --> 12:37.689
(alyssa panting)

13:01.648 --> 13:04.182
- I need to use the bathroom.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.583
- Okay. Just give
me a minute, okay?

13:05.685 --> 13:06.951
Let's order first
and I'll go with you.

13:07.053 --> 13:08.853
- I've really gotta go.

13:08.955 --> 13:10.488
- Emma, okay, just
give me a minute.

13:10.590 --> 13:11.923
- It's right over there.

13:12.025 --> 13:14.592
I've been to that bathroom,
like, a hundred times.

13:14.694 --> 13:16.127
- Yes, and every time with me.

13:17.931 --> 13:18.830
- Please?

13:21.067 --> 13:23.735
- Okay, but hurry back. And
don't forget to wash your hands.

13:23.837 --> 13:24.803
- Okay.
- Okay.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.810
- [waiter] you all set?

13:31.912 --> 13:33.545
(alyssa sighs)

13:33.647 --> 13:34.846
- yeah, she'll have
the mac and cheese,

13:34.948 --> 13:36.014
and I'll have a chicken salad.

13:36.116 --> 13:36.881
- All right.
- Thanks.

13:36.983 --> 13:38.683
- Anything else to drink?

13:38.785 --> 13:40.885
- No. Maybe just
a brownie later.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.654
- [waiter] all right.

13:46.560 --> 13:47.392
- Emma?

13:49.663 --> 13:51.095
Emma, are you in there?

13:51.198 --> 13:53.064
(suspenseful music)

13:53.166 --> 13:54.232
emma?

13:55.402 --> 13:56.234
Emma?!

13:57.537 --> 13:58.603
Have you seen my daughter?

13:58.705 --> 13:59.571
- No.

14:03.410 --> 14:04.309
- Emma!

14:07.080 --> 14:08.379
Have you seen my daughter?

14:08.481 --> 14:09.380
- [waiter] mm-mm.

14:09.482 --> 14:11.816
- Emma?!

14:11.918 --> 14:13.818
(emma laughs)

14:13.920 --> 14:15.753
emma, oh, my god. Emma.

14:15.856 --> 14:18.456
You scared me. Don't you
ever do that to me again.

14:22.696 --> 14:24.562
- I was just trying
to be funny, mommy.

14:24.664 --> 14:28.366
- I'm sorry. I couldn't
see you, I got so scared.

14:28.468 --> 14:30.768
- I'll always be safe,
mommy, I promise.

14:30.871 --> 14:32.437
- I'm sorry, sweetie.

14:35.976 --> 14:37.308
(reporters chattering)

14:37.410 --> 14:39.510
- [reporter] I have
a few questions.

14:39.613 --> 14:41.112
Wondering if you
have any comments?

14:41.214 --> 14:44.215
(reporters chattering)

14:49.256 --> 14:50.722
- [alyssa] come
on, baby. Come on.

14:50.824 --> 14:53.024
- Can we get a quick
comment? Just really quick.

14:53.126 --> 14:54.392
Can you tell us how you feel?
(reporters chattering)

14:54.494 --> 14:57.629
- [alyssa] please
leave us alone.

14:57.731 --> 14:58.930
- [reporter] ms.
Manning, ms. Manning,

14:59.032 --> 15:00.865
how do you feel about
mr. Simon's release?

15:00.967 --> 15:01.933
- Tell them.

15:02.969 --> 15:05.303
Tell them, alyssa.
Tell them how it was.

15:05.405 --> 15:09.073
(reporter chattering)

15:09.175 --> 15:10.842
- ms. Manning, ms. Manning,

15:10.944 --> 15:13.978
do you have any feeling
about mr. Simon's release?

15:14.080 --> 15:15.613
- [reporter] alyssa,
do you feel safe?

15:15.715 --> 15:16.748
Should other parents-
- no statement.

15:16.850 --> 15:19.367
- [reporter] please,
alyssa, we need to know.

15:19.486 --> 15:21.486
(lock clicks)

15:21.588 --> 15:22.453
(alyssa sighs)

15:22.555 --> 15:24.022
- am I gonna be on the news?

15:24.124 --> 15:26.391
- Not if I can help it. Go
on up to your room, okay?

15:26.493 --> 15:27.558
- [emma] okay.

15:28.328 --> 15:33.364
(alyssa sighs)
(cellphone clicking)

15:34.200 --> 15:36.701
- hi. It's a lot
worse than I thought.

15:36.803 --> 15:38.403
We might need someone over here.

15:39.472 --> 15:40.405
Okay. Thanks.

15:41.207 --> 15:42.640
Bye.

15:42.742 --> 15:43.474
(cellphone clicks)

15:43.576 --> 15:46.678
(cellphone chimes)

15:46.780 --> 15:47.845
- miles, miles, miles!
- Hey, miles!

15:47.948 --> 15:48.880
- Miles!
- Miles, miles, miles!

15:48.982 --> 15:49.948
- [reporter] do you
have any regrets

15:50.050 --> 15:51.416
now that you're out of prison?

15:51.518 --> 15:52.750
Do you plan on seeing alyssa?

15:52.852 --> 15:55.920
(reporters chattering)

15:58.925 --> 16:01.592
(horns honking)

16:08.268 --> 16:10.935
(ominous music)

16:28.989 --> 16:31.522
(miles sighs)

16:42.068 --> 16:46.037
- [miles] little emma, you
look just like your mom.

16:46.139 --> 16:47.105
- [alyssa] I totally freaked,

16:47.207 --> 16:49.374
and emma was there,
just playing.

16:49.476 --> 16:51.976
- We've established you will
continue to suffer the effects

16:52.078 --> 16:54.879
of post-traumatic stress
disorder due to your trauma.

16:54.981 --> 16:56.914
Accept it and don't beat
yourself up about it.

16:57.017 --> 16:59.817
- I mean, sure, the kidnapping
caused me sadness at the time

16:59.919 --> 17:02.754
because I missed my parents,
but miles never hurt me.

17:02.856 --> 17:04.555
He only showed me love.

17:04.657 --> 17:07.942
- He took you away from a normal
childhood and isolated you.

17:08.061 --> 17:11.629
Severe emotional distress or
physical reactions to something

17:11.731 --> 17:13.765
that reminds you of
that event makes sense.

17:13.867 --> 17:15.066
(alyssa sighs)

17:15.168 --> 17:16.667
how are you feeling
about his release?

17:16.770 --> 17:18.336
- I feel like I'm supposed
to hate this monster

17:18.438 --> 17:20.405
that people are
making him out to be,

17:20.507 --> 17:23.875
and feel enraged about him
getting out, but I don't.

17:23.977 --> 17:24.909
I feel for him.

17:26.713 --> 17:27.812
I know he's not a monster

17:27.914 --> 17:30.348
and I just want him
to find peace someday.

17:30.450 --> 17:32.150
- And what do you
really feel will happen

17:32.235 --> 17:33.618
if your behavior continues?

17:34.721 --> 17:36.270
- It already cost me a marriage.

17:37.824 --> 17:40.191
It's made it really hard
to find a new partner.

17:40.293 --> 17:44.429
But my biggest fear is
that I'm damaging emma.

17:44.531 --> 17:46.898
- You're feeling guilty
about your ex-husband?

17:47.000 --> 17:49.067
- I mean, the older emma gets,

17:49.169 --> 17:51.669
I realize that she might
need a man in the house.

17:51.771 --> 17:52.437
But not tony.

17:53.973 --> 17:56.707
I mean, he can blame me all
he wants, but he was reckless.

17:56.810 --> 17:59.043
He was the one who
was able to walk away.

17:59.145 --> 18:00.778
- Does she ask about him?

18:00.880 --> 18:02.080
- Not that much.

18:02.182 --> 18:05.416
He emailed me the other
day, asking to see emma.

18:05.518 --> 18:08.186
I guess he's gonna be in
town for business this week.

18:10.256 --> 18:11.522
But I didn't tell her.

18:12.725 --> 18:14.225
I didn't wanna get her
hopes up to be crushed

18:14.327 --> 18:15.827
like all the other times.

18:15.929 --> 18:17.795
- This is a heightened
time for you.

18:17.897 --> 18:20.832
Maybe it's time to
trust and let go.

18:20.934 --> 18:23.201
What happened to you is
your story, not hers.

18:23.303 --> 18:24.669
Don't let the past keep you

18:24.771 --> 18:26.637
from what the
present has to offer.

18:26.739 --> 18:27.538
- I know.

18:28.842 --> 18:29.674
I get that.

18:32.095 --> 18:34.045
Hell, I've spent my
life preaching it.

18:34.147 --> 18:35.146
- Maybe start small.

18:36.549 --> 18:38.249
Perhaps have her spend the
night at a friend's house

18:38.351 --> 18:41.385
or have someone other than
grace take care of her.

18:41.488 --> 18:44.322
You're a busy woman,
you could use the help.

18:46.192 --> 18:48.226
(alyssa sighs)

18:48.328 --> 18:49.694
- how you doing?
Hanging in there?

18:49.796 --> 18:51.863
- I'm fine if I didn't
have to keep up with you.

18:51.965 --> 18:54.832
- Oh.
(alyssa laughs)

18:54.934 --> 18:56.134
(camera snaps)

18:56.236 --> 18:57.201
- [photographer] alyssa,
have you been in contact

18:57.303 --> 18:58.503
with miles since his release?

18:58.605 --> 18:59.837
- [grant] go. Go!

19:01.941 --> 19:04.909
- It's like 25 years
ago all over again.

19:05.011 --> 19:08.212
Interview requests, people
hiding out to snag a pic.

19:08.314 --> 19:10.281
- Must've been hard
for a kid, huh?

19:10.383 --> 19:12.750
- That's why my main
concern is emma.

19:12.852 --> 19:14.785
I don't want a picture
of her out there.

19:16.356 --> 19:17.722
You know, I'm starting to think

19:17.824 --> 19:20.525
that maybe it's not the
right timing for the book.

19:20.627 --> 19:22.260
- Or it's a great time to show

19:22.362 --> 19:24.629
that you're strong, not afraid.

19:26.032 --> 19:28.032
- [alyssa] you know, this
isn't gonna be easy for us.

19:28.134 --> 19:29.200
- I do.

19:29.302 --> 19:30.468
I also see more everyday

19:30.570 --> 19:32.103
why I wanna be here
for you and emma.

19:34.174 --> 19:36.140
- You know, maybe you're right,

19:36.242 --> 19:38.609
maybe releasing the book
now is a real power move.

19:38.711 --> 19:40.745
- Mm. Yeah.

19:41.814 --> 19:42.580
Yeah, it is.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.850
(both chuckling)

19:45.952 --> 19:48.719
- so the team wants to nail
down the new release date

19:48.821 --> 19:51.522
so you can announce it on
your "wake up" appearance.

19:51.624 --> 19:52.523
What?

19:52.625 --> 19:53.491
- Nothing.

19:55.461 --> 19:56.494
I'm ready.
- Okay.

19:56.596 --> 19:58.629
Well, you and emma
can make a day of it.

19:58.731 --> 20:00.331
There's a great park downtown

20:00.433 --> 20:02.533
and it's right across the
street from the studio.

20:02.635 --> 20:03.935
I'm sure she'd love that.

20:05.338 --> 20:06.437
- Right. I'm sure she would.

20:06.539 --> 20:07.405
- Mm.

20:08.675 --> 20:09.440
Alyssa.

20:10.510 --> 20:13.411
This book is an
amazing accomplishment.

20:13.496 --> 20:15.580
I really think using
those intimate details

20:15.682 --> 20:17.215
from your journals is gonna make

20:17.317 --> 20:19.884
an emotional impact
on the reader.

20:19.986 --> 20:24.121
- It's just, those were
always only my memories,

20:24.224 --> 20:25.957
and now they're gonna be out
there for the world to see.

20:26.059 --> 20:29.527
- Maybe that's a good thing.
A cleansing of sorts, hm?

20:32.732 --> 20:34.332
(alyssa sighs)

20:34.434 --> 20:37.201
sorry, it's always hard to get
the whole team here on time.

20:37.303 --> 20:39.804
- I have to pick up emma
from school at three.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.739
I knew I was cutting
this too close.

20:44.510 --> 20:46.477
(cellphone chimes)

20:46.579 --> 20:49.513
(cellphone chiming)

20:50.683 --> 20:51.916
grace can't pick her up.

20:53.353 --> 20:54.085
Can we reschedule?

20:55.388 --> 20:56.654
- Hey, this has been
on the books for weeks.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.656
It's not normal for
the president of
the publishing house

20:58.758 --> 21:01.192
to come to a meeting,
let alone head it.

21:01.294 --> 21:03.527
Is there anyone else, at
all, who can pick her up?

21:07.550 --> 21:08.232
Hi.

21:08.334 --> 21:09.033
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

21:09.135 --> 21:11.035
(line rings)

21:11.137 --> 21:12.203
- [grant] hi.

21:12.305 --> 21:15.139
- Hey. I am stuck in a meeting.

21:17.043 --> 21:18.376
I have a huge favor to ask you.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.178
- [grant] of course. Anything.

21:21.281 --> 21:23.214
- [alyssa] you think you could
pick up emma from school?

21:25.318 --> 21:26.784
- [grant] sure.

21:28.121 --> 21:30.521
- [alyssa] thank you. It's
three o'clock at the front gate.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.490
Please text me
once you have her.

21:32.592 --> 21:33.891
- [grant] got it.

21:33.993 --> 21:35.693
(cellphone chimes)

21:35.795 --> 21:38.562
(clock ticking)

21:43.803 --> 21:46.704
(cellphone chimes)

21:47.740 --> 21:48.806
- how long is this gonna be?

21:48.908 --> 21:52.209
- Oh, not long. Is
everything okay?

21:52.312 --> 21:53.611
(alyssa sighs)

21:53.713 --> 21:56.380
(clock ticking)

22:01.721 --> 22:02.887
hey, alyssa-

22:02.989 --> 22:05.690
- I'm sorry, I need
to make a call.

22:05.792 --> 22:06.691
- So sorry.

22:07.460 --> 22:08.359
Hey.

22:09.662 --> 22:11.896
Alyssa, what is going on?

22:11.998 --> 22:13.030
- Nothing, I just...

22:14.400 --> 22:16.267
(alyssa sighs)
(button clicks)

22:16.369 --> 22:17.234
(elevator bell chimes)
- okay, well is there anything

22:17.337 --> 22:18.069
I can do?
- No, no.

22:18.171 --> 22:19.704
I just have to go.

22:19.806 --> 22:22.373
(button clicks)

22:24.744 --> 22:26.444
(cellphone ringing)
- oh.

22:26.546 --> 22:27.745
Oh. You got it?

22:27.847 --> 22:30.514
- [emma] yes.

22:30.616 --> 22:31.515
- You're in?
- Mm-hm.

22:37.824 --> 22:40.358
- Hey.
- Where are you?

22:40.460 --> 22:41.926
- [grant] we stopped
to get milkshakes.

22:42.028 --> 22:43.327
- Where's emma?

22:43.429 --> 22:44.295
- She's right here.
She's right next to me.

22:44.397 --> 22:45.529
- Hi, mommy.
- See?

22:45.631 --> 22:48.532
- Hi, baby. I've been
texting and calling you.

22:48.634 --> 22:50.501
- Oh, yeah, sorry,
I wanted to avoid

22:50.603 --> 22:52.002
any distractions
while driving emma,

22:52.105 --> 22:54.071
so I put my phone
in the console,

22:54.173 --> 22:56.073
and when we stopped,
I left it in the car.

22:56.175 --> 22:57.308
I'm sorry. We're
heading home now.

22:57.410 --> 22:58.542
- I'm on my way.

23:01.514 --> 23:03.948
(door opens)

23:05.785 --> 23:06.784
- mommy.
- Hi, sweetie.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.853
- We went out to
get milkshakes. See?

23:08.955 --> 23:11.622
- Oh, that's great. I
need to talk to grant.

23:11.724 --> 23:13.557
Why don't you go upstairs
and do your homework, okay?

23:13.659 --> 23:14.325
- Okay.

23:16.095 --> 23:18.662
(alyssa sighs)

23:19.665 --> 23:20.564
- how could you do that?

23:20.666 --> 23:22.466
- I'm sorry, I just...

23:22.568 --> 23:23.934
She asked if we could
stop for milkshakes,

23:24.036 --> 23:26.270
and I don't know, I
didn't wanna say no.

23:26.372 --> 23:27.905
- Why didn't you ask me first?

23:28.007 --> 23:29.774
- Your instructions
were to text you

23:29.876 --> 23:31.575
when I picked her up, and I did.

23:31.677 --> 23:33.310
And then I just...

23:33.413 --> 23:34.211
I knew you were an
important meeting,

23:34.313 --> 23:35.679
and I didn't wanna
interrupt you.

23:35.782 --> 23:37.948
- Do you have any idea what
was going through my mind?

23:40.286 --> 23:41.352
Look, I'm sorry.

23:42.622 --> 23:43.687
I know you're trying to help

23:43.790 --> 23:45.055
and you're doing
your best, but...

23:45.158 --> 23:46.557
(alyssa sighs)

23:46.659 --> 23:48.092
- but what?

23:48.194 --> 23:50.161
- Maybe until emma gets older,

23:51.464 --> 23:53.597
I'm just not capable
of having a man around.

23:55.368 --> 23:56.267
I'm really sorry.

23:59.405 --> 24:01.372
- Not as sorry as I am.

24:06.979 --> 24:07.845
- Emma.

24:12.218 --> 24:13.451
(door slams)
- the situation you've

24:13.553 --> 24:14.685
just described with grant

24:14.787 --> 24:17.521
sounds like a pivotal
moment in your development.

24:18.925 --> 24:19.623
- I agree.

24:19.725 --> 24:21.759
(alyssa sighs)

24:21.861 --> 24:23.127
and once again, I failed.

24:24.664 --> 24:26.564
I let my past derail my present.

24:28.768 --> 24:30.801
I guess do as I
say, not as I do?

24:31.804 --> 24:32.770
- I have a thought.

24:34.740 --> 24:36.340
Instead of running from it,

24:36.442 --> 24:38.309
why not deal with
your past presently?

24:40.179 --> 24:41.912
Miles is a free man.

24:42.014 --> 24:44.014
It might do you good
to finally talk to him.

24:45.117 --> 24:46.016
Just think about it.

24:49.522 --> 24:51.989
- [emma] that was so cool.
Can I be on tv next time?

24:52.091 --> 24:54.091
- [alyssa] absolutely not.

24:54.193 --> 24:57.728
- Wow, this park is beautiful.
Wanna come play with us?

24:57.830 --> 24:58.796
- I wish.

24:58.898 --> 25:00.264
I gotta head back to the studio

25:00.366 --> 25:02.833
and take care of a few things,
but you guys have fun, okay?

25:02.935 --> 25:03.634
- Okay.

25:03.736 --> 25:04.802
- Hey, this airs Monday,

25:04.904 --> 25:06.470
but we'll be in
touch before then.

25:06.572 --> 25:07.571
- Thanks, sarah.
- Bye.

25:07.673 --> 25:08.539
- Bye.

25:08.641 --> 25:10.341
- Can I go fly my kite?

25:10.443 --> 25:12.643
- Oh, sure. Stay where
I can see you, okay?

25:12.745 --> 25:13.611
- [emma] okay.

25:29.362 --> 25:32.096
(cellphone rings)

25:33.199 --> 25:34.031
- hello?

25:38.037 --> 25:39.069
Hello?

25:44.076 --> 25:46.844
(ominous music)

25:49.815 --> 25:50.447
emma?

25:52.785 --> 25:53.817
This isn't funny, emma.

25:59.525 --> 26:01.492
Hi. Miss, have you
seen this little girl?

26:01.594 --> 26:03.627
She was just here.
She was flying a kite.

26:03.729 --> 26:05.162
Didn't see her at all?

26:07.366 --> 26:08.065
Emma?

26:10.403 --> 26:11.669
Ma'am, I'm so sorry.

26:11.771 --> 26:13.337
Have you seen my
daughter? Her name's emma.

26:13.439 --> 26:14.305
She was just there with me.

26:14.407 --> 26:15.272
- No.

26:16.876 --> 26:19.877
(suspenseful music)

26:28.921 --> 26:30.020
- emma!

26:35.528 --> 26:37.061
- [detective] you said you
walked away to answer a call.

26:38.064 --> 26:38.996
- I was right there.

26:40.166 --> 26:43.567
Emma was right there and
then she was just gone.

26:43.669 --> 26:44.535
- So there was a brief time

26:44.637 --> 26:46.637
when you didn't
have eyes on her.

26:46.739 --> 26:47.838
- Come on, detective.

26:47.923 --> 26:51.342
- I know this is difficult,
but we need information.

26:51.444 --> 26:53.644
Who knew you'd be there
today at that time?

26:54.413 --> 26:55.646
- Only people I know.

26:55.748 --> 26:58.382
- People you know are exactly
where we usually start.

26:58.484 --> 26:59.950
Any family members or exes?

27:02.755 --> 27:03.687
- Oh, my god.

27:04.590 --> 27:05.723
Her father is in town.

27:07.193 --> 27:08.359
- I'll call him.

27:08.461 --> 27:11.362
- Yeah, he wanted to see her.

27:11.464 --> 27:12.863
- You haven't contacted him?

27:14.200 --> 27:15.399
- No. No, he wouldn't
take me seriously.

27:15.501 --> 27:16.867
- Well, is he the kind of dad

27:16.969 --> 27:18.469
that will snatch her
up and not tell you?

27:18.571 --> 27:20.771
- No.

27:20.873 --> 27:21.572
No, no.

27:23.042 --> 27:24.074
I don't know. I don't think so.

27:24.176 --> 27:25.442
No, he's just...

27:26.479 --> 27:27.544
He's angry.

27:28.614 --> 27:29.780
- At you?

27:29.882 --> 27:31.415
- Well, yeah, I haven't
exactly been lenient

27:31.517 --> 27:33.851
with him seeing emma, but
he wouldn't just take her.

27:33.953 --> 27:35.586
- Oh, you'd be surprised.

27:35.688 --> 27:37.121
With parental kidnapping,

27:37.223 --> 27:39.957
it's usually just an attempt
to spend time with the child.

27:40.059 --> 27:42.693
They justify it as being
their right as a parent.

27:44.630 --> 27:46.463
- Him wanting to be around
was never the issue,

27:46.565 --> 27:48.766
it was him not
wanting to be around.

27:48.868 --> 27:50.300
Look, detective,
tony's no angel,

27:50.403 --> 27:54.204
but no, no, this
doesn't sound like him.

27:54.306 --> 27:56.640
- The good news, if it is him,

27:56.742 --> 28:00.110
these cases usually end in
the safe return of the child.

28:00.212 --> 28:01.412
- Tony's not answering.

28:01.514 --> 28:03.147
I left a message, told
him it was urgent,

28:03.249 --> 28:04.481
and to call detective barkley.

28:04.583 --> 28:06.450
- Was there anyone else
who knew you'd be there?

28:06.552 --> 28:07.368
- No.

28:09.155 --> 28:10.187
But I can't help but thinking

28:10.289 --> 28:12.840
this is all a really
big coincidence.

28:12.958 --> 28:13.624
- Miles?

28:15.194 --> 28:17.127
- He just got released from
prison, and now this happens?

28:17.229 --> 28:19.346
- Well, he's a
person of interest.

28:19.465 --> 28:20.964
We can't consider
him an actual suspect

28:21.067 --> 28:22.232
based on coincidence.

28:23.235 --> 28:24.768
But we can question him.

28:24.870 --> 28:26.370
- I'll get his info
from the captain.

28:27.807 --> 28:29.640
(door opens)
(reporters chattering)

28:29.742 --> 28:30.974
- [officer] hold on there a sec.

28:31.077 --> 28:32.576
- [sarah] hi, I'm sorry,
I'm alyssa's friend from...

28:32.678 --> 28:33.777
Would you move?

28:33.863 --> 28:34.911
Excuse me!
- It's okay.

28:35.014 --> 28:36.547
- Alyssa!
- It's okay, she's my friend.

28:36.649 --> 28:37.581
You can let her in.

28:38.718 --> 28:41.418
- I'm so sorry. I came
as soon as I could.

28:42.521 --> 28:44.221
- Did you make any
actual announcements

28:44.323 --> 28:45.723
when I was gonna be
shooting that segment?

28:45.825 --> 28:48.325
- No, not shooting, just the
air date, which is Monday.

28:48.427 --> 28:49.626
- But is it possible
that somehow

28:49.729 --> 28:51.228
someone found out my schedule

28:51.330 --> 28:52.696
of when I was gonna
be at the studio?

28:52.798 --> 28:55.499
- Yeah, I suppose. I've answered
press requests all week.

28:55.601 --> 28:58.502
I could've mentioned that we
were scheduled to tape today.

29:00.072 --> 29:03.107
I mean, I don't know, I've
had so many calls. Maybe.

29:04.176 --> 29:06.944
Look, there was a
weird one this morning,

29:07.046 --> 29:08.245
asking about when
you were shooting,

29:08.347 --> 29:10.781
but I thought it was just press.

29:10.883 --> 29:13.784
- Or someone posing as press.
Did you get their name?

29:13.886 --> 29:14.885
- No, no, I...

29:16.055 --> 29:17.387
(detective sighs)
what are we saying,

29:17.490 --> 29:19.690
this was planned
around your appearance?

29:19.792 --> 29:21.325
- The speed at which
the abduction happened,

29:21.427 --> 29:25.496
if that's what this is, seem
to be planned, not random.

29:25.598 --> 29:28.665
- Do you think it
was him? Miles?

29:28.768 --> 29:30.834
- This is his new address.

29:30.936 --> 29:32.603
Captain has cleared
us to question him.

29:32.705 --> 29:34.404
It's only about 10
miles from here.

29:34.507 --> 29:35.372
- 10 miles?

29:35.474 --> 29:37.274
- In the meantime,
you let us know

29:37.376 --> 29:38.709
if you hear from the father.

29:38.811 --> 29:41.478
If he is behind this
and attempts to take
her out of state,

29:41.580 --> 29:43.747
we need to hand it over
to the fbi, immediately.

29:43.849 --> 29:45.215
- Why don't you get
them involved now?

29:45.317 --> 29:48.485
- Not yet. I have my guys
trying to locate your ex.

29:48.571 --> 29:51.155
And when they do, we'll know
whether this is an abduction

29:51.257 --> 29:52.890
or a parental kidnapping.

29:52.992 --> 29:54.357
Right now, we need to confirm

29:54.460 --> 29:56.026
exactly what we're dealing with.

29:56.128 --> 29:59.129
- I'll go try and track down
who called this morning.

29:59.231 --> 30:02.065
And you call me when you know
anything. We will find her.

30:02.168 --> 30:04.368
- Thank you.
- Hey, I got you.

30:04.470 --> 30:05.903
Call me.

30:06.005 --> 30:08.105
- We'll have an
officer stay with you.

30:08.207 --> 30:09.740
- No, I'm coming with you.

30:09.825 --> 30:11.375
- Alyssa, let us do our jobs.

30:11.477 --> 30:15.546
- Grace, I know miles better
than anyone in this world.

30:15.648 --> 30:16.814
I should come.

30:16.916 --> 30:18.332
- I can't legally
stop her from coming.

30:19.652 --> 30:21.819
She's right, perhaps
she could be helpful.

30:21.921 --> 30:23.754
- Are you sure you're
okay to see him?

30:25.925 --> 30:28.525
(alyssa sighs)

30:42.141 --> 30:43.740
- whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:43.843 --> 30:47.277
Hang back. Let us
search the place first.

30:57.456 --> 30:58.388
22?

31:01.760 --> 31:04.161
(door knocking)

31:06.265 --> 31:07.664
mr. Simon.

31:07.766 --> 31:08.599
- Yeah?

31:08.701 --> 31:09.600
- I was told your parole officer

31:09.702 --> 31:11.235
filled you in on why we're here.

31:11.337 --> 31:12.636
- Yep.

31:12.721 --> 31:15.539
- We would like to start
by searching the residence.

31:15.641 --> 31:16.607
Do we have your consent?

31:17.743 --> 31:18.542
- Absolutely.

31:31.257 --> 31:33.891
(gentle music)

31:48.007 --> 31:49.006
- she's not here.

31:51.076 --> 31:52.943
(thrilling music)

31:53.045 --> 31:53.777
- hey.
- Alyssa, wait.

31:53.879 --> 31:55.012
- [detective] alyssa, hold on.

31:58.317 --> 31:59.716
- Get outta my way. Emma!

32:00.953 --> 32:03.186
Emma, baby, where are you?!

32:04.023 --> 32:06.490
Emma! It's okay, baby!

32:06.592 --> 32:07.257
Emma?

32:21.807 --> 32:24.207
Where is she? Where is she?!

32:24.310 --> 32:25.309
What did you do to her?!

32:25.411 --> 32:26.643
- I could-
- no, tell me where she is!

32:26.745 --> 32:29.546
- I could not hurt you or
your daughter, you know that.

32:31.183 --> 32:33.016
I was just about to
tell the detective

32:33.118 --> 32:35.552
I had a meeting this morning
with my parole officer.

32:35.654 --> 32:36.520
- Jack mckinney, right?

32:36.622 --> 32:38.989
- Yes, from 9:30 to 11.

32:40.960 --> 32:43.060
After a quick stop to the
market, I came right back here.

32:43.162 --> 32:45.862
There's no way I could've
made it downtown and back.

32:47.166 --> 32:48.298
- How did you know
I was downtown?

32:48.400 --> 32:49.700
- It's all over
the radio and tv.

32:49.802 --> 32:52.235
They've been airing it
for the last two hours.

32:56.508 --> 32:58.976
Look, alyssa, I am so sorry.

33:00.012 --> 33:01.011
I'm so sorry you're
going to this,

33:01.113 --> 33:03.680
but I don't know where she is.

33:04.550 --> 33:05.983
- Mckinney confirms his alibi,

33:06.085 --> 33:10.087
says the login sheet shows
they met from 9:29 to 11:03.

33:11.724 --> 33:15.192
- All right. We'll let you go
on with your day, mr. Simon.

33:20.566 --> 33:21.498
- Alyssa.

33:25.104 --> 33:26.169
Can I talk to you?

33:30.209 --> 33:31.641
- It's your call.

33:39.551 --> 33:40.384
- Sit down.

33:54.900 --> 33:56.533
You haven't changed a bit.

33:58.670 --> 34:00.837
I know your concern right
now is to find your daughter,

34:00.939 --> 34:05.342
but please, I never
thought I'd see you again,

34:06.812 --> 34:09.046
I have something
to say just in case

34:09.148 --> 34:10.714
we don't see each
other ever again.

34:15.521 --> 34:17.771
One has a lot of time
to think in prison.

34:21.060 --> 34:22.025
And for the longest time,

34:22.127 --> 34:24.528
I tried to justify
what I did to you,

34:26.665 --> 34:28.098
that I deserved you.

34:30.285 --> 34:31.735
I suffered loss myself,

34:31.837 --> 34:36.273
so I figured it was an
eye for an eye of sorts.

34:37.609 --> 34:40.010
And then I realized it
came down to one thing:

34:41.980 --> 34:42.979
I was selfish.

34:44.783 --> 34:48.518
I destroyed a young life just
to fill a void in my own life.

34:50.522 --> 34:53.323
I did damage that would
last you a lifetime,

34:53.425 --> 34:54.458
and I'm so sorry.

34:57.029 --> 34:58.328
Please forgive me.

35:00.799 --> 35:01.648
I never hurt you.

35:03.302 --> 35:06.136
I only showed you love and gave
you the best house I could.

35:06.238 --> 35:07.070
- I know.

35:07.172 --> 35:09.372
- Then how could I hurt you now?

35:09.475 --> 35:10.607
I hurt for you.

35:12.144 --> 35:13.143
Please, let me help you.

35:13.245 --> 35:13.944
- I don't think
that's a good idea.

35:14.046 --> 35:15.278
- This is a kidnapping.

35:15.380 --> 35:16.880
I know what could be going on

35:16.982 --> 35:18.949
through the mind of a kidnapper.

35:20.018 --> 35:23.153
Please, let me help you.

35:23.255 --> 35:24.754
- All right, let's go.

35:28.760 --> 35:29.759
- [miles] alyssa.

35:30.963 --> 35:32.596
- Thank you, but we'll
handle the investigation.

35:32.698 --> 35:33.897
If you do have information,

35:33.999 --> 35:35.565
you have detective
barkley's card.

35:35.667 --> 35:36.633
- Alyssa.

35:39.071 --> 35:41.204
I hope you can forgive me.

35:47.946 --> 35:50.347
(door closes)

35:53.352 --> 35:54.618
- [officer] all right,
folks, that's enough.

35:54.720 --> 35:56.086
Let's just clear it out.

35:59.758 --> 36:01.591
- I just spoke with the captain.

36:01.677 --> 36:02.959
- And?

36:03.061 --> 36:06.062
- They found tony.
Emma was not with him.

36:06.165 --> 36:08.999
But they still brought him to
the station for questioning.

36:09.968 --> 36:10.600
- Did he have an alibi?

36:10.702 --> 36:12.269
- That's all I know.

36:12.371 --> 36:14.871
They're still considering
him a suspect for now.

36:14.973 --> 36:16.106
- You know the hardest part?

36:18.810 --> 36:20.877
I don't know what I'm
supposed to be doing.

36:21.747 --> 36:23.880
Am I supposed to just
sit here and wait

36:23.949 --> 36:25.682
while my baby girl is
out there somewhere,

36:25.784 --> 36:27.050
probably terrified?

36:29.254 --> 36:29.953
Or what if she's-

36:30.055 --> 36:32.022
- don't think like that.

36:32.124 --> 36:34.891
Okay, emma is alive and well,
and we're gonna find her.

36:34.993 --> 36:36.159
- You don't know that.

36:38.897 --> 36:40.597
I would be searching
all day, all night,

36:40.699 --> 36:42.199
if I knew where to start.

36:42.301 --> 36:43.400
I should be out there.

36:43.502 --> 36:46.469
- Doing what,
searching aimlessly?

36:46.572 --> 36:49.206
The best thing you can
do right now is think.

36:49.308 --> 36:52.042
Okay, most kidnappings
are by a familiar person

36:52.144 --> 36:53.610
or a family member.

36:53.679 --> 36:56.479
Is there anyone else you can
think of who fits that bill?

36:57.816 --> 36:59.049
- I did have one thought.

37:01.086 --> 37:02.052
- Grant.

37:03.222 --> 37:04.921
Yeah, I had the same.

37:05.023 --> 37:07.090
As your friend, I was
worried it might upset you.

37:07.192 --> 37:11.194
But as a cop, I definitely
think we have to consider him.

37:11.296 --> 37:14.764
- Yeah, he's familiar, but
it doesn't make any sense.

37:16.168 --> 37:18.835
Unless somehow, he blames emma
for me breaking up with him?

37:20.639 --> 37:22.639
- Do you know where
he was this morning?

37:22.741 --> 37:25.675
- He said he was out of
town. San francisco, I think.

37:25.777 --> 37:26.977
- But you haven't talked to him?

37:27.079 --> 37:29.946
- No. I mean, I ended
things pretty abruptly.

37:30.048 --> 37:31.915
And I was kind of awful to him.

37:33.352 --> 37:34.551
- Okay, I'll tell
barkley to bring him in.

37:34.653 --> 37:35.885
- [alyssa] no, no.

37:35.988 --> 37:36.786
Not yet. Please.

37:36.888 --> 37:38.121
- Why?

37:38.206 --> 37:40.423
- Just give me a minute
to talk to him first.

37:41.326 --> 37:42.692
I already hurt him.

37:42.794 --> 37:44.060
Now I'm gonna have the police
bring him in for questioning

37:44.162 --> 37:45.362
on the kidnapping
of my daughter?

37:45.464 --> 37:48.465
- I can't imagine how
you must be feeling,

37:48.567 --> 37:49.966
but emma is like
my daughter too,

37:50.068 --> 37:52.535
and I don't think we should
leave any stone unturned.

37:52.638 --> 37:55.205
- Just let me give him
a chance to explain.

37:57.209 --> 37:58.041
- Okay.

37:59.011 --> 38:00.043
I'm working a double tonight,

38:00.128 --> 38:01.911
but I'll call in sick
to stay with you.

38:02.014 --> 38:03.213
- No. Just go.

38:04.182 --> 38:07.083
Like you said, I
just, I need to think.

38:08.787 --> 38:12.155
- All right. But I will
check in on you later.

38:12.257 --> 38:15.258
And there's a patrol car outside
in case you need anything.

38:15.360 --> 38:17.193
Let me know if
you talk to grant,

38:17.296 --> 38:19.696
and I'll let you know if
I hear anything on tony.

38:38.116 --> 38:40.784
(alyssa crying)

38:45.090 --> 38:47.991
(cellphone chimes)

38:51.163 --> 38:54.097
(suspenseful music)

39:14.052 --> 39:15.785
- emma? Is that you?

39:22.394 --> 39:25.462
(crickets chirping)

39:25.564 --> 39:26.496
emma.

39:29.601 --> 39:30.300
- Hey.
- Oh!

39:30.402 --> 39:31.501
- I'm sorry.

39:31.603 --> 39:33.103
I didn't think
the boys out front

39:33.205 --> 39:34.437
would let a person of
interest just come see you.

39:34.539 --> 39:35.705
- What are you doing here?

39:35.807 --> 39:37.607
- Alibi stuck. They released me.

39:38.443 --> 39:40.310
You reported me as a suspect.

39:40.412 --> 39:41.611
- No.

39:41.713 --> 39:43.079
- No?
- Yes, but not like that.

39:43.181 --> 39:45.215
They were asking about
family members or exes,

39:45.317 --> 39:47.183
and I just, I remember
that you were-

39:47.285 --> 39:49.152
- I haven't even had a
chance to process the fact

39:49.254 --> 39:50.453
that my daughter is missing

39:50.555 --> 39:53.590
because I am too busy
defending my innocence!

39:53.692 --> 39:54.891
I am her father!

39:54.993 --> 39:56.626
And I'm in that station

39:56.728 --> 39:58.661
and they are questioning
me like I'm the criminal!

39:59.765 --> 40:02.065
I had to call my
coworkers this morning,

40:02.167 --> 40:05.735
as witnesses, so they could
confirm that I was in a meeting.

40:06.872 --> 40:08.138
Do you have any
idea how that felt?!

40:08.240 --> 40:10.407
- Okay, you are
really upset with me-

40:10.509 --> 40:12.542
- really, alyssa?!
I'm getting upset.

40:12.644 --> 40:14.210
I get upset. So what?!

40:14.312 --> 40:16.479
It doesn't mean that I'm
going to kidnap my daughter!

40:16.581 --> 40:20.750
You have already robbed
me of a life with her.

40:20.852 --> 40:22.419
I mean, this is what...

40:22.521 --> 40:25.021
I had no choice. This
is what drove me away!

40:25.123 --> 40:27.757
- You've always been able to
see her whenever you wanted.

40:27.859 --> 40:31.394
- On your terms. She was never
my daughter, she was yours.

40:31.496 --> 40:33.296
- That is not true.
- You never allowed her

40:33.398 --> 40:34.998
to be ours.
- That is not true!

40:35.100 --> 40:36.266
- It's not true?

40:36.368 --> 40:37.867
How many times have you
overreacted, alyssa?

40:37.969 --> 40:40.804
I mean, you have practically
manifested this thing

40:40.906 --> 40:42.806
every single day of her life.

40:42.908 --> 40:44.407
And now, she actually
might be gone!

40:44.509 --> 40:46.576
- No, she is gone!
- Okay, and if she is,

40:46.678 --> 40:49.813
if she actually is missing
this time, it is your fault.

40:49.915 --> 40:50.947
- Oh, go! Just go!

40:51.049 --> 40:53.416
Leave.
- Ms. Manning, you okay?

40:53.518 --> 40:55.185
- Yeah. This is my ex-husband.

40:55.287 --> 40:57.487
We were just talking.

40:57.589 --> 40:59.689
- Sounded like more
than just talking.

40:59.791 --> 41:00.757
- Mr. Manning, I
think you should-

41:00.859 --> 41:01.991
- yeah, I'm going.

41:02.093 --> 41:04.627
We're fine. Just
one minute, officer.

41:06.431 --> 41:09.732
Look, I love our daughter.

41:11.203 --> 41:13.803
She's out there
somewhere, missing.

41:16.074 --> 41:18.308
I'm gonna do everything
in my power to find her.

41:19.845 --> 41:20.777
But not with you.

41:31.356 --> 41:33.990
(alyssa sighs)

41:37.996 --> 41:41.531
(police radio chattering)

41:45.737 --> 41:48.104
- officer, he's okay.

41:48.206 --> 41:49.405
It's fine. It's fine.

41:49.508 --> 41:50.173
- Thank you.

41:51.009 --> 41:51.841
Hey.

41:52.811 --> 41:54.477
So glad to hear it from you.

41:54.579 --> 41:57.780
I felt sick since
I've heard. Any news?

41:57.883 --> 42:00.383
You know I would do anything
to help you find emma.

42:00.485 --> 42:01.384
Anything.

42:01.486 --> 42:02.318
- Have the police
contacted you yet?

42:02.420 --> 42:03.620
- No. Why would they?

42:05.857 --> 42:06.823
Is that why I'm here?

42:08.226 --> 42:09.626
You think I had something
to do with this?

42:11.263 --> 42:12.328
- I'm sorry, but they
have to question everyone

42:12.430 --> 42:13.463
who was close to emma.

42:13.565 --> 42:15.098
You knew her. She trusted you.

42:15.200 --> 42:16.699
You knew we were gonna
be downtown that day.

42:16.801 --> 42:18.101
- You are serious. Wow.

42:19.604 --> 42:20.403
Okay.

42:21.540 --> 42:22.906
I was out of town.

42:23.008 --> 42:24.741
I had that conference in
san francisco, remember?

42:24.843 --> 42:27.343
I left early yesterday morning.
I got back late last night.

42:27.445 --> 42:28.244
- Right.

42:29.080 --> 42:29.946
Right, I just...

42:32.083 --> 42:33.716
(grant sighs)

42:33.818 --> 42:34.484
- see?

42:35.687 --> 42:37.353
Flight to san
francisco and back.

42:37.455 --> 42:39.088
If it helps, I'll go to
the police right now.

42:39.190 --> 42:40.123
I'll go make a statement.

42:40.225 --> 42:41.558
- I'm sorry.

42:41.660 --> 42:44.594
I'm sorry, I just, I feel
so hopeless and desperate.

42:44.696 --> 42:46.996
And I-
- then let me help you.

42:47.098 --> 42:49.832
Okay? At least let
me be here for you.

42:49.935 --> 42:51.267
I'll come stay with you.

42:51.369 --> 42:53.336
- Thank you, I just
need to find emma.

42:53.438 --> 42:57.307
- Alyssa, would you just
let me help? Please?

42:57.409 --> 42:58.741
(door closes)

42:58.843 --> 43:01.511
(ominous music)

43:05.116 --> 43:07.116
- mommy! Please, help me!

43:07.218 --> 43:08.251
I'm scared!
- Scared!

43:08.353 --> 43:09.385
- Help!
- Scared!

43:09.487 --> 43:10.687
Scared! Scared!

43:10.789 --> 43:11.988
Scared! Scared!

43:20.432 --> 43:23.166
(birds chirping)

43:24.502 --> 43:27.136
(door knocking)

43:29.774 --> 43:31.608
- hey. I brought food.

43:31.710 --> 43:32.675
You need to eat.

43:32.777 --> 43:33.910
- I was on my way to work

43:34.012 --> 43:35.545
and I saw sarah's
car parked out front.

43:35.647 --> 43:37.914
Got me to thinking,
you need anything?

43:38.016 --> 43:39.749
- We don't know
what to do, alyssa.

43:40.919 --> 43:42.585
We just wanna be here for you.

43:42.687 --> 43:44.854
- Thanks. Come in.

43:44.956 --> 43:46.389
- [sarah] yeah.

43:55.166 --> 43:57.500
- I told barkley what you
said about grant's alibi.

43:57.602 --> 44:00.236
They're gonna question him,
even though he's not a suspect.

44:00.338 --> 44:01.904
- How do you know
he's not a suspect?

44:02.007 --> 44:03.373
- He was out of town.

44:03.475 --> 44:04.374
- He could be lying.

44:04.476 --> 44:05.475
- He's not.

44:05.577 --> 44:07.143
- [sarah] well, how do you know?

44:07.245 --> 44:10.113
- I saw his boarding passes.
That enough evidence for you?

44:13.251 --> 44:14.083
- Sorry.

44:16.021 --> 44:18.321
- It's okay. I know
you're trying to help.

44:20.659 --> 44:23.126
- I was reading online that
one of the biggest reasons

44:23.228 --> 44:26.429
for kidnapping is that people
can't have children or adopt,

44:26.531 --> 44:28.564
and they desperately want a kid.

44:28.667 --> 44:31.634
I mean, is there anyone you
know who fits that description?

44:31.736 --> 44:33.670
- Most couples I know
already have kids.

44:33.772 --> 44:36.039
- Well, actually single women
in their late 30s are the most

44:36.141 --> 44:37.707
common demographic
in those cases.

44:37.776 --> 44:41.644
- The important thing is to
trust that emma is out there

44:41.746 --> 44:43.413
and that she's safe.

44:43.515 --> 44:45.415
And the team will find
her and bring her home.

44:45.517 --> 44:46.716
- You spend a lot
of time with emma.

44:46.818 --> 44:48.718
I mean, she trusts
you more than anyone

44:48.820 --> 44:50.186
besides her own mother.

44:51.356 --> 44:52.588
- She's like a daughter to me.

44:52.691 --> 44:55.091
- So has she mentioned anyone?

44:55.193 --> 44:57.960
Like another adult
she talks to or likes?

44:58.063 --> 45:00.530
- No. I mean, I know
she really likes grant.

45:03.501 --> 45:05.034
I gotta get to work.

45:05.136 --> 45:08.304
I'll see if I can find out
more when I get to the station.

45:08.406 --> 45:10.073
- I'll walk you out.

45:10.175 --> 45:10.973
- Bye.

45:15.880 --> 45:18.815
- Hey. What the hell was that?

45:18.917 --> 45:20.550
- I don't know where
she was going with that.

45:20.652 --> 45:22.518
- Did you tell her I'm
not able to have children?

45:22.620 --> 45:24.470
- No, of course not.

45:24.589 --> 45:26.589
- She's the one who
told some random person

45:26.691 --> 45:27.924
where you and emma
were scheduled to be

45:28.026 --> 45:29.792
the day she was abducted, right?

45:32.430 --> 45:33.396
I'm being horrible.

45:34.365 --> 45:35.765
You're going through this,

45:35.867 --> 45:38.301
and we're running around like
children blaming each other.

45:39.437 --> 45:40.203
I love you.

45:40.305 --> 45:42.138
- I know. I love you too.

45:45.176 --> 45:46.576
- Check on you after my shift?

45:46.678 --> 45:48.211
And know that I will
be out there working

45:48.313 --> 45:49.612
to bring emma home.

45:50.982 --> 45:52.014
- Bye.
- Bye.

46:01.092 --> 46:02.725
- I wasn't trying to eavesdrop.

46:02.827 --> 46:04.026
I was just coming
to let you know

46:04.129 --> 46:05.828
I should probably
head out as well.

46:05.930 --> 46:07.864
- You don't have to go.

46:09.734 --> 46:11.934
- You know, I wasn't
accusing anyone of anything.

46:12.036 --> 46:14.537
I was just trying to help
by sharing what I read.

46:14.639 --> 46:15.671
- I know, it's-
- no.

46:15.774 --> 46:18.775
Look, I'm sorry, I don't
deal with tragedy well.

46:18.860 --> 46:21.277
I never know what to
say or how to behave,

46:21.379 --> 46:23.346
and I just come
off as insensitive.

46:23.448 --> 46:26.783
Just know that I'm trying to
help you in whatever way I can.

46:26.885 --> 46:28.417
- I know.

46:28.520 --> 46:32.155
And I really do appreciate
that and your friendship. I do.

46:34.926 --> 46:36.559
- I unwrapped lunch and
left it in the fridge

46:36.661 --> 46:38.194
for whenever you're ready.

46:41.766 --> 46:42.732
- Bye.
- Bye.

46:45.036 --> 46:47.870
(mysterious music)

47:08.126 --> 47:10.726
(keys jingling)

47:12.697 --> 47:15.631
(crickets chirping)

47:25.143 --> 47:27.443
(lock clicks)

47:54.739 --> 47:56.072
- [alyssa] emma?

48:18.730 --> 48:19.562
- Seriously?

48:24.202 --> 48:26.102
Did you actually let
her get in your head?

48:29.073 --> 48:30.923
- I'm sorry, but I looked up

48:31.042 --> 48:34.377
some of the articles
that sarah mentioned,

48:34.479 --> 48:36.679
and I know how long you've been
wanting a baby of your own-

48:36.781 --> 48:39.949
- so you thought what, I would
kidnap emma? And then what?

48:40.051 --> 48:41.017
- I don't know.

48:42.987 --> 48:44.220
I just, I got this crazy idea

48:44.322 --> 48:47.123
that maybe you took her

48:47.225 --> 48:48.624
and you were planning
on leaving town.

48:48.726 --> 48:49.592
I don't know.

48:49.694 --> 48:50.693
- Do you hear yourself?

48:50.795 --> 48:52.628
- I know, I'm not
thinking straight.

48:55.700 --> 48:57.867
Why didn't you tell me that
you were trying to adopt?

48:57.969 --> 48:59.368
You tell me everything.

48:59.470 --> 49:02.872
- Because I didn't wanna
get your hopes up, or mine.

49:02.974 --> 49:04.307
And as you can see, it's
a good thing I didn't.

49:04.409 --> 49:05.975
- Well, you should've told me.

49:07.211 --> 49:08.744
I could've been there for you.

49:09.847 --> 49:13.416
- It's not final, but
it doesn't look good.

49:13.518 --> 49:15.284
This makes my
relationship with emma

49:15.386 --> 49:16.786
that much more important.

49:18.089 --> 49:20.856
She is like mine, alyssa,

49:20.959 --> 49:23.292
in a very positive
and healthy way.

49:24.329 --> 49:25.895
I'm blessed to have
her in my life.

49:25.997 --> 49:29.031
- I never really
doubted you, not really.

49:29.133 --> 49:30.032
I...

49:33.204 --> 49:34.570
(grace sighs)

49:34.672 --> 49:36.572
- you need to trust the
police and the process.

49:36.674 --> 49:38.140
Promise me you'll do that.

49:38.242 --> 49:39.075
- I'll try.

49:40.378 --> 49:41.577
- I'm scared for you.

49:43.147 --> 49:44.780
I think you should
call dr. Kaye.

49:46.918 --> 49:48.484
We'll get her back.

49:49.387 --> 49:51.053
- I know. I know we will.

49:52.490 --> 49:53.356
- And I need to say this

49:53.458 --> 49:55.875
because, well, I
just need to say it.

49:57.261 --> 50:00.529
What really hurts is that
you would question me

50:00.631 --> 50:03.466
based on something
coming from sarah.

50:03.568 --> 50:05.468
I have always been
here for you and emma.

50:05.570 --> 50:06.736
She is the one
who just showed up

50:06.838 --> 50:08.371
in your lives out of nowhere.

50:08.473 --> 50:09.572
- No, not exactly.

50:09.674 --> 50:11.974
I mean, you remember,
she replaced caroline.

50:12.076 --> 50:14.977
- Yeah, who mysteriously died
falling from her terrace.

50:17.181 --> 50:18.881
- What are you implying?

50:18.950 --> 50:20.716
(grace sighs)

50:20.818 --> 50:23.285
- god, now I'm the one
thinking crazy thoughts, right?

50:23.388 --> 50:24.186
- Yeah.

50:25.990 --> 50:27.690
Look, I'm done, I'm
done speculating

50:27.792 --> 50:29.792
and creating these
ridiculous scenarios.

50:31.379 --> 50:33.562
(alyssa sighs)

50:33.664 --> 50:34.797
I'm gonna take your advice.

50:36.467 --> 50:37.566
I love you.

50:39.470 --> 50:40.603
- I love you too.

50:48.746 --> 50:50.146
- I'm scared.

50:50.248 --> 50:51.347
You know, I feel like I
should have had the tools

50:51.449 --> 50:52.448
to control my thoughts
and to calm myself,

50:52.550 --> 50:54.683
but I feel like I'm unraveling,

50:54.786 --> 50:56.085
like I should be doing something

50:56.187 --> 50:58.120
instead of just sitting
here and waiting!

50:58.222 --> 50:59.488
- All of this has
obviously brought back

50:59.590 --> 51:01.123
familiar wounds to you.

51:02.193 --> 51:05.027
You may help millions of
people, but you're still human.

51:05.129 --> 51:06.495
Let's get back to miles.

51:06.597 --> 51:07.930
- I already told
you what he said.

51:08.032 --> 51:10.499
- But you never told
me if you forgave him.

51:10.601 --> 51:12.835
- I feel like he's
the one person

51:12.937 --> 51:14.503
who can actually
help me find emma,

51:15.807 --> 51:17.740
but everyone around me is
gonna think I'm out of my mind.

51:17.842 --> 51:18.941
- I don't.

51:19.043 --> 51:20.876
I also think that with both
your parents being gone,

51:20.978 --> 51:23.979
you see him as a lone
parental figure in your life.

51:24.082 --> 51:26.615
We lean on our parents
in times of need.

51:27.585 --> 51:29.385
- He's not my father,

51:29.487 --> 51:30.553
he's the man who kidnapped me

51:30.655 --> 51:32.455
and took me away
from my real parents.

51:32.540 --> 51:34.657
- It's not the titles
we put on people,

51:34.759 --> 51:37.259
it's the emotional connection.

51:37.361 --> 51:39.495
- Are you saying that I wanna
reach out to him for help

51:39.597 --> 51:41.363
because I identify
with him as my father?

51:41.466 --> 51:44.233
- Yes, and as someone
who cared for you

51:44.302 --> 51:45.901
and apparently still does.

51:47.205 --> 51:48.571
There are a lot of
wounds still left to heal

51:48.673 --> 51:50.506
after these 25 years.

51:50.608 --> 51:52.508
- My main concern is
finding my daughter,

51:53.744 --> 51:55.111
and I'll do anything
I can to get her back,

51:55.213 --> 51:57.379
even if it means going to
my own kidnapper for help.

51:58.483 --> 51:59.598
I don't think I
should concern myself

51:59.717 --> 52:01.917
with healing these
scars at the same time.

52:02.019 --> 52:04.453
- Unless that is the key
to bringing her home.

52:05.990 --> 52:06.989
In the journals you let me read,

52:07.091 --> 52:08.824
you only mentioned
some initial feelings

52:08.926 --> 52:10.292
of fear and uncertainty.

52:11.829 --> 52:13.062
Once you became acclimated
to your new surroundings

52:13.164 --> 52:14.730
and got used to
living with miles,

52:14.832 --> 52:18.734
there were some touching moments
of love and selflessness.

52:20.171 --> 52:23.672
No would blame you if you
didn't absolutely hate him.

52:27.445 --> 52:29.545
(alyssa crying)

52:29.647 --> 52:31.280
- [sarah] hey,
alyssa, it's sarah.

52:31.382 --> 52:33.849
I know this is a terrible time
and I hate to bring it up,

52:33.951 --> 52:37.119
but the team is trying to
finalize the book release date.

52:37.221 --> 52:38.387
I told them I would
talk to you about it-

52:38.489 --> 52:40.055
(cellphone clicks)

52:40.158 --> 52:42.825
(door knocking)

52:44.529 --> 52:45.661
(police radio chattering)

52:45.763 --> 52:47.696
- [officer] ms. Manning,
you have a visitor.

52:50.301 --> 52:51.734
- [alyssa] you can let him in.

52:53.371 --> 52:54.336
- Thank you.

52:57.008 --> 52:58.040
- Hey.
- Hey.

52:59.443 --> 53:02.645
Look, being apart these
few days has just shown me

53:02.747 --> 53:04.146
how much I care about you.

53:05.516 --> 53:07.683
And when you care about someone,

53:07.785 --> 53:09.351
you don't just let
them hurt alone.

53:12.707 --> 53:13.322
- I'm sorry.

53:14.692 --> 53:15.991
I'm sorry that I was so cold

53:16.093 --> 53:17.993
and that I thought,
even for a second-

53:18.095 --> 53:19.762
- I understand, you know?

53:19.864 --> 53:23.265
And it just kills me that
you're going through this.

53:23.367 --> 53:24.500
- I missed you.

53:27.438 --> 53:28.571
- In case you're hungry.

53:29.840 --> 53:31.273
And if not, you know
I got no problem

53:31.359 --> 53:33.209
crushing two combo
platters by myself.

53:33.311 --> 53:36.145
(alyssa chuckles)

53:38.182 --> 53:39.248
- [alyssa] weird.

53:39.350 --> 53:40.182
- What?

53:41.185 --> 53:42.718
Who is it?
- There's no caller id,

53:42.820 --> 53:44.953
but there's a video attached.

53:45.056 --> 53:48.757
- Mommy, they said

53:48.859 --> 53:51.393
you have 24 hours
to find me or...

53:51.495 --> 53:52.962
- [woman] you'll
never see me again.

53:53.064 --> 53:54.630
- You'll never see me again.

53:54.732 --> 53:57.266
They said you would
know what that means.

53:57.368 --> 53:58.767
Mommy, please!

53:59.670 --> 54:00.836
I don't want to!

54:02.273 --> 54:03.572
- [alyssa] officer, look.

54:03.674 --> 54:04.406
- What is it, ma'am?
- Okay, alyssa,

54:04.508 --> 54:05.941
this is actually a good thing.

54:06.043 --> 54:07.076
This means that emma's alive
and she's out there somewhere.

54:07.178 --> 54:08.544
We can find her.
- But what if we don't?

54:08.646 --> 54:09.878
What if-
- we will find her.

54:09.947 --> 54:11.313
I promise.

54:11.415 --> 54:12.648
- Can you airdrop this to me?
- Yeah, of course.

54:12.750 --> 54:13.515
- All right, we're gonna
pass it to detective barkley.

54:13.618 --> 54:15.084
A video like this usually means

54:15.186 --> 54:16.885
that they want us
to find the victim.

54:16.988 --> 54:18.354
Based on the timing,
it's most likely

54:18.456 --> 54:21.490
a sick publicity stunt by
someone desperate for cash.

54:21.592 --> 54:23.225
- They didn't say
anything about cash.

54:23.327 --> 54:26.395
If it was about that, then why
didn't they send this sooner?

54:26.497 --> 54:28.030
Unless it's not even
about keeping emma

54:28.132 --> 54:29.098
or getting anything in return.

54:29.200 --> 54:30.966
- I'm gonna get
barkley on the radio,

54:31.068 --> 54:32.201
let him know to expect this.

54:32.270 --> 54:34.069
- All right, thank you, officer.

54:36.140 --> 54:37.439
What are you saying,
someone would take emma

54:37.541 --> 54:39.808
just to hurt her?
- No, not emma, me.

54:39.910 --> 54:41.277
- Who would wanna hurt you?

54:41.379 --> 54:43.012
(alyssa sighs)

54:43.114 --> 54:44.630
- who? Miles?

54:44.749 --> 54:45.848
- I can't help thinking
he's responsible for this,

54:45.950 --> 54:48.150
or that he holds the
key to knowing who is.

54:48.252 --> 54:49.618
I need to talk to him again.

54:49.720 --> 54:51.704
- No, what you need to do
is let the police handle it.

54:51.822 --> 54:53.689
- I've already done that,
and they did nothing,

54:53.791 --> 54:55.157
not a single lead.

54:55.259 --> 54:56.659
If this video is real,

54:56.761 --> 54:59.028
I only have one day or my
daughter's gone forever.

54:59.130 --> 55:01.497
- Okay. But I'm coming with you.

55:01.599 --> 55:02.665
- No.

55:02.733 --> 55:03.999
I need him to open up,

55:04.101 --> 55:05.467
he's not gonna do
that with you there.

55:05.569 --> 55:07.870
- Then I'll wait in the
car. That's nonnegotiable.

55:09.473 --> 55:10.339
- Okay.

55:11.075 --> 55:12.374
Backdoor. Come on.

55:18.316 --> 55:20.849
(birds chirping)

55:24.388 --> 55:26.221
- I thought about what you said.

55:27.024 --> 55:28.390
I think maybe you could help me.

55:32.897 --> 55:33.929
- Let's take a walk.

55:39.770 --> 55:41.637
So what can I do you for?

55:41.739 --> 55:42.721
- You know, my whole
life, people have told me

55:42.807 --> 55:46.208
I'm supposed to hate
you and never trust you.

55:46.310 --> 55:47.643
- I can't blame them.

55:49.213 --> 55:50.946
But clearly, you don't
feel the same way,

55:51.048 --> 55:53.549
or you wouldn't
be here right now.

55:53.651 --> 55:55.517
- I'm here because I
need to find my daughter.

55:56.754 --> 55:57.820
And you understand
the mind of someone

55:57.922 --> 56:00.255
who'd take a child away
from their parents.

56:00.358 --> 56:01.523
- Unfortunately, I do.

56:04.395 --> 56:06.328
- But I think this is different.

56:06.430 --> 56:08.697
I don't think the reason they
took emma is to keep her.

56:09.533 --> 56:10.933
- Why would you say that?

56:13.637 --> 56:15.003
(alyssa sighs)

56:15.106 --> 56:16.472
- I'm just positive it isn't.

56:16.574 --> 56:21.343
- Well, maybe not the same goal,
but same type of abduction.

56:22.213 --> 56:23.846
When I first heard about this,

56:23.948 --> 56:27.282
I wondered if it would be
some sort of a copycat,

56:29.954 --> 56:32.020
how I took you in
front of your parents.

56:33.424 --> 56:37.693
Some sick people consider
it a feat worth duplicating.

56:39.263 --> 56:42.965
When I worked at your school,
I took care to be kind to you.

56:43.067 --> 56:47.035
I always greeted you with
a smile to gain your trust.

56:48.472 --> 56:49.338
I'm wondering if the person

56:49.440 --> 56:51.173
who took emma did
the same thing.

56:54.345 --> 56:55.544
- When you put it like that,

56:55.646 --> 56:57.679
it reminds me of the
horrible thing that you did,

56:58.682 --> 56:59.815
manipulating a child.

57:02.019 --> 57:02.751
I don't even know
why I'm standing here

57:02.853 --> 57:04.153
talking to you right now.

57:04.255 --> 57:06.288
- Look, I read that article
of yours from college.

57:07.525 --> 57:10.025
- You mean "consciously
forgiving"?

57:10.127 --> 57:11.193
- That's the one.

57:12.096 --> 57:14.363
Forgiving someone who
you know did things

57:14.465 --> 57:15.931
that were unforgivable.

57:16.033 --> 57:18.967
And I heard you on your podcast
talking about who you trust.

57:20.671 --> 57:23.705
- Trusting someone from
a current emotional place

57:23.808 --> 57:25.874
with zero input from
past situations.

57:27.077 --> 57:29.978
- At least in this situation,
you have something to rely on.

57:30.080 --> 57:31.547
Look, I know it
took me a long time,

57:31.649 --> 57:34.750
but in the end, I
knew you trusted me.

57:36.153 --> 57:36.952
- I did.

57:38.589 --> 57:40.456
Looking back as an adult,
I have no idea why.

57:40.558 --> 57:41.623
- Oh, I'd like to think

57:41.725 --> 57:44.793
that I eventually earned
it with my actions.

57:46.764 --> 57:48.831
And I would like to
gain that trust again.

57:55.673 --> 57:58.273
- [alyssa] are you kidding me?

58:03.047 --> 58:04.413
This really isn't
a good time, sarah.

58:04.515 --> 58:07.349
- I know. Look, I'm sorry,
the team just won't stop.

58:07.451 --> 58:08.417
Hey, we're under
a lot of pressure

58:08.519 --> 58:10.085
to meet this deadline and...

58:11.155 --> 58:13.055
All I need is your
approval on the new cover

58:13.157 --> 58:15.023
and that one small
edit to the forward.

58:15.125 --> 58:17.493
- You can tell the team that
it's gonna have to wait.

58:23.767 --> 58:25.934
(alyssa sighs)

58:26.036 --> 58:26.902
I talked to miles.

58:27.004 --> 58:28.270
- What? Why?

58:28.372 --> 58:29.771
- I needed to know
if he could help.

58:29.874 --> 58:32.207
- How can you trust him,
after what he did to you?

58:32.309 --> 58:33.475
And you still don't know

58:33.577 --> 58:35.477
if he's somehow responsible
for all of this.

58:35.579 --> 58:36.778
- Yeah, well, none of
it matters now anyway

58:36.881 --> 58:37.913
because the police
have the video.

58:38.015 --> 58:39.214
They can work from that.

58:39.316 --> 58:39.982
- What video?

58:42.386 --> 58:43.819
- Emma's alive.

58:43.921 --> 58:45.454
- Mommy, they said...

58:45.556 --> 58:47.556
- [woman] you have
24 hours to find me.

58:47.658 --> 58:49.057
- Wait.
- You have 24 hours

58:49.159 --> 58:50.158
to find me or...

58:50.261 --> 58:51.326
- Look, the blanket.

58:51.428 --> 58:53.161
Look at the blanket beside her.

58:53.264 --> 58:54.930
Blue with white clouds.
- Wait.

58:55.032 --> 58:56.131
- [emma] mommy, please!

58:56.233 --> 58:57.366
- Oh, my god.

58:59.703 --> 59:01.103
- What? What is it?

59:01.205 --> 59:03.539
- He placed me in a room
alone at the foot of the bed.

59:03.641 --> 59:05.040
A blue blanket with white clouds

59:05.142 --> 59:07.576
would be my sole comfort
for the next six years.

59:09.780 --> 59:11.146
- Can't believe I
didn't see this.

59:11.248 --> 59:13.348
- No, it's my job to know
your book better than you.

59:13.450 --> 59:15.984
And this video has
to be from miles.

59:16.086 --> 59:17.553
- Come on.

59:17.655 --> 59:19.821
- Hey, alyssa, the video
proves miles is behind this.

59:19.924 --> 59:22.124
You have to have the
police pick him up, now.

59:22.226 --> 59:24.526
- No, as soon as the police
get involved, he'll clam up.

59:24.628 --> 59:26.361
If he's responsible, I
can get it out of him.

59:26.463 --> 59:27.763
- Oh, if he's responsible?

59:27.865 --> 59:29.965
- I'm sorry, I just, I keep
trying to convince myself

59:30.067 --> 59:32.434
that he isn't this
monster we all know he is.

59:34.638 --> 59:36.838
- Okay, but please be careful.

59:37.841 --> 59:39.575
(suspenseful music)

59:46.984 --> 59:49.618
- I can't believe I trusted you.

59:50.754 --> 59:51.320
- [miles] what are
you talking about?

59:51.422 --> 59:52.587
- Where is she?

59:52.690 --> 59:53.722
- I thought that's
why you came here,

59:53.824 --> 59:55.257
so we can figure
it out together.

59:55.359 --> 59:57.125
- So you can make me look
like even more of a fool?

59:57.227 --> 59:58.627
- How am I making
you look like a fool?

59:58.729 --> 1:00:01.129
- The video! How do
you explain the video?

1:00:02.633 --> 1:00:03.532
- What video?
- Please, please,

1:00:03.634 --> 1:00:04.900
just be honest with me.

1:00:05.002 --> 1:00:06.702
All I want is my
little girl back.

1:00:13.410 --> 1:00:14.810
- [emma] mommy, they said...

1:00:14.912 --> 1:00:17.045
- [woman] you have
24 hours to find me.

1:00:17.147 --> 1:00:18.580
- [emma] you have 24 hours

1:00:18.682 --> 1:00:20.082
to find me or-
- when did you get this?

1:00:20.184 --> 1:00:21.683
- [grant] this morning,

1:00:21.785 --> 1:00:23.285
- but why didn't you
show it to me earlier?

1:00:23.387 --> 1:00:25.120
- I didn't know if
I could trust you,

1:00:25.222 --> 1:00:26.722
which seems to be the case.

1:00:27.725 --> 1:00:28.590
- What changed?

1:00:29.760 --> 1:00:30.859
You don't think I sent this?

1:00:30.961 --> 1:00:32.060
- Look at it!

1:00:36.533 --> 1:00:37.232
- Oh, my god.

1:00:37.334 --> 1:00:38.667
- It's the same blanket.

1:00:38.769 --> 1:00:42.270
- Yes. Police took it the same
day they took you from me.

1:00:42.373 --> 1:00:47.342
Look, guys, I don't have
anything to do with this.

1:00:56.120 --> 1:00:58.186
But I think I know who does.

1:01:00.224 --> 1:01:01.289
My daughter sophie.

1:01:03.961 --> 1:01:04.826
- Sophie?

1:01:06.330 --> 1:01:07.996
Your daughter you
named me after?

1:01:09.199 --> 1:01:10.132
Sophie's dead.

1:01:11.001 --> 1:01:12.267
You told me she died.

1:01:15.139 --> 1:01:16.672
- Look, the real
reason I kidnapped you

1:01:16.774 --> 1:01:18.807
wasn't because my
daughter sophie died.

1:01:19.877 --> 1:01:22.577
My wife became ill
and eventually passed.

1:01:23.614 --> 1:01:25.213
It was up to me to
raise sophie on my own.

1:01:26.684 --> 1:01:28.417
But I did the best I could.

1:01:28.519 --> 1:01:31.720
I mean, with the doctor bills
and with the regular bills,

1:01:31.822 --> 1:01:33.455
I had to take three jobs,

1:01:33.557 --> 1:01:37.225
and I had to leave
sophie at home, a lot.

1:01:37.327 --> 1:01:40.562
And eventually, my
neighbor called the county,

1:01:40.664 --> 1:01:44.132
and they deemed me unfit,
and they took her from me.

1:01:44.234 --> 1:01:46.201
- Why didn't you
fight to get her back?

1:01:47.304 --> 1:01:49.004
- They shipped her halfway
across the country,

1:01:49.106 --> 1:01:51.173
put her in some foster home.

1:01:51.275 --> 1:01:54.910
- So why take me? Why not just
go find her and kidnap her?

1:01:55.012 --> 1:01:56.411
- Look, I tried.

1:01:56.513 --> 1:01:59.648
Every time I came close, they
sent her off to another home.

1:01:59.750 --> 1:02:02.484
Eventually, I ran out of
resources to keep trying.

1:02:03.854 --> 1:02:07.756
When she was gone,
I was devastated.

1:02:10.561 --> 1:02:11.626
I didn't wanna live.

1:02:15.132 --> 1:02:16.565
Then, I saw you at the school.

1:02:19.570 --> 1:02:20.635
- Why me?

1:02:20.738 --> 1:02:23.038
- I don't know
how to explain it.

1:02:23.140 --> 1:02:26.141
Your spirit, your sweetness
reminded me of sophie,

1:02:26.243 --> 1:02:28.577
and I was lonely and selfish

1:02:28.679 --> 1:02:30.378
and clearly not in the
right frame of mind.

1:02:30.481 --> 1:02:33.181
I just thought if I
could make you my sophie,

1:02:33.283 --> 1:02:34.983
then I could live again.

1:02:35.085 --> 1:02:36.618
I convinced myself
that it would be like

1:02:36.720 --> 1:02:38.286
she was never taken from me.

1:02:38.388 --> 1:02:41.022
- But how? How could you keep
that from me all this time?

1:02:41.125 --> 1:02:43.325
- I just thought if
you showed me sympathy,

1:02:43.427 --> 1:02:45.927
that you'd be okay with
our lives together.

1:02:46.029 --> 1:02:48.730
But I knew lying to
you, you'd be upset,

1:02:48.832 --> 1:02:50.432
so I never said anything.

1:02:55.873 --> 1:02:56.538
- Where is sophie now?

1:02:56.640 --> 1:02:57.806
- I don't know.

1:02:59.143 --> 1:03:03.145
I received one letter after
trying to contact her for years.

1:03:05.349 --> 1:03:07.749
The one thing I do know
is that she hates me.

1:03:08.952 --> 1:03:09.985
She doesn't want to have
anything to do with me.

1:03:10.087 --> 1:03:11.586
- We have to find her.

1:03:13.490 --> 1:03:14.556
Do you have a
picture or anything?

1:03:14.658 --> 1:03:15.957
- Yeah, I have one.

1:03:27.404 --> 1:03:28.537
- I know this picture.

1:03:29.439 --> 1:03:32.207
(miles crying)

1:04:07.444 --> 1:04:09.778
I knew this was sophie
because of her necklace.

1:04:11.448 --> 1:04:12.314
I remember thinking
I wanted one,

1:04:12.416 --> 1:04:14.282
and I asked you,
but you said no.

1:04:14.384 --> 1:04:17.285
- That was the only thing I
was ever able to give her.

1:04:19.256 --> 1:04:20.188
Look, I don't know where she is,

1:04:20.290 --> 1:04:22.257
but I'm sure she still
has that blanket.

1:04:23.861 --> 1:04:26.194
She brought it with
her when they took her.

1:04:26.296 --> 1:04:29.331
I bought an identical
one and gave it to you.

1:04:29.433 --> 1:04:30.932
She must still have it.

1:04:31.034 --> 1:04:32.100
- Or you're full of it and
you're lying through your teeth.

1:04:32.202 --> 1:04:33.568
- Grant.
- What?

1:04:33.670 --> 1:04:34.836
Why would you believe
him after everything

1:04:34.938 --> 1:04:35.737
he's lied to you about?

1:04:35.839 --> 1:04:37.138
We're going to the police.

1:04:37.241 --> 1:04:39.841
- Look, you can do whatever
you want. I'm tired of lying.

1:04:41.211 --> 1:04:43.211
But I think you're right,
I think this is personal.

1:04:43.313 --> 1:04:44.212
It's revenge.

1:04:44.314 --> 1:04:45.780
- From sophie?

1:04:45.883 --> 1:04:47.782
- Yeah, that's why I think it
was important to tell you now,

1:04:47.885 --> 1:04:48.917
that her last letter,

1:04:49.019 --> 1:04:50.418
she made it clear
that the only person

1:04:50.520 --> 1:04:52.621
she hated more than me was you.

1:04:53.624 --> 1:04:55.023
- But why?

1:04:55.125 --> 1:04:57.025
- The life I gave
you in her place.

1:04:58.495 --> 1:05:01.596
Look, she didn't get that
beautiful home like I thought.

1:05:01.698 --> 1:05:04.266
She was just shuffling around
from bad home to bad home.

1:05:04.368 --> 1:05:05.467
- Okay, we have to tell
everything to grace and barkley

1:05:05.569 --> 1:05:07.435
so they can find sophie.

1:05:07.537 --> 1:05:09.271
- Do you have any
information on her?

1:05:09.356 --> 1:05:10.989
Birth certificate,
social security?

1:05:11.108 --> 1:05:13.441
- I lost her birth
certificate a long time ago.

1:05:13.527 --> 1:05:14.342
- Birth date?

1:05:15.212 --> 1:05:16.344
- Yeah. Yeah.

1:05:21.084 --> 1:05:23.285
- And we can take this picture
with us? Show the police?

1:05:23.387 --> 1:05:27.322
- Sure, but be careful.
It's the only one I have.

1:05:27.424 --> 1:05:28.256
- Thank you.

1:05:40.237 --> 1:05:41.336
Grace isn't answering.

1:05:42.673 --> 1:05:43.872
But barkley should
be at the station.

1:05:43.974 --> 1:05:45.507
- Okay, I'm gonna
drop you off at home.

1:05:45.609 --> 1:05:46.841
I'm gonna head down to my office

1:05:46.944 --> 1:05:48.977
'cause my buddy in hr does
background checks all day long

1:05:49.079 --> 1:05:50.412
and it's crazy
what they can find

1:05:50.514 --> 1:05:51.713
with just a name
and a birth date.

1:05:51.798 --> 1:05:53.515
Plus, if sophie was in
the foster care system,

1:05:53.600 --> 1:05:54.666
then there must be
a record, right?

1:05:54.785 --> 1:05:55.583
- I agree.

1:05:56.586 --> 1:05:57.385
Thank you.

1:05:58.388 --> 1:05:59.888
- We're gonna find her. Okay?

1:06:01.158 --> 1:06:06.094
Okay.

1:06:11.101 --> 1:06:12.000
- I don't understand.

1:06:13.303 --> 1:06:15.770
I'm handing you a lead,
more than a lead, a suspect.

1:06:15.872 --> 1:06:19.007
- And I told you, someone
owning the same blanket as you

1:06:19.109 --> 1:06:22.210
from 30 years ago hardly
makes them a suspect.

1:06:22.312 --> 1:06:24.612
We will look into the
sophie simon thing.

1:06:24.715 --> 1:06:26.047
It's not much to go on.

1:06:26.149 --> 1:06:30.018
- Not much? Detective, I'm
giving you a name and a photo.

1:06:30.120 --> 1:06:31.019
What the hell have you given me,

1:06:31.121 --> 1:06:32.520
except for a bunch of stories?

1:06:32.622 --> 1:06:35.623
- Look, I promise you, we're
doing everything we can.

1:06:37.194 --> 1:06:38.093
Meet me there.

1:06:39.563 --> 1:06:40.428
- I don't get it.

1:06:41.565 --> 1:06:42.630
I've got a picture.
I've got a name.

1:06:42.733 --> 1:06:44.366
I've got a birth date.

1:06:44.468 --> 1:06:46.735
- And you got all that from
the man who kidnapped you,

1:06:46.837 --> 1:06:48.503
and did 25 years
in prison for it.

1:06:48.605 --> 1:06:49.971
Think about it, don't you think

1:06:50.073 --> 1:06:51.673
he could be trying
to mislead us?

1:06:52.843 --> 1:06:54.209
- But his theory makes sense.

1:06:54.311 --> 1:06:55.810
- Because you want
it to make sense.

1:06:55.912 --> 1:06:58.646
But if you look at
it objectively, it's
quite a stretch.

1:06:58.749 --> 1:07:00.548
If this theory came
from a viable source,

1:07:00.650 --> 1:07:02.050
it would hold a
little more validity.

1:07:02.152 --> 1:07:03.651
- Well, at least he's
trying to help me.

1:07:03.754 --> 1:07:06.454
All you guys are doing are
telling me to be patient.

1:07:06.556 --> 1:07:08.590
You try being patient when
your child's life is at stake.

1:07:08.692 --> 1:07:11.559
- Alyssa, think about what
this man is capable of doing.

1:07:11.661 --> 1:07:12.861
- All I care about is
finding my daughter.

1:07:12.963 --> 1:07:15.764
If that takes using him,
then I'm okay with that.

1:07:15.866 --> 1:07:18.700
And as my best friend, you
should be okay with that too.

1:07:19.669 --> 1:07:20.769
- Give me the picture.

1:07:25.842 --> 1:07:28.543
Okay, I'll get an age
progression image run on this.

1:07:28.645 --> 1:07:30.512
We can get an idea of what
she would look like today.

1:07:30.614 --> 1:07:31.846
- Thank you.

1:07:31.948 --> 1:07:34.482
- It could take a bit,
so try to be patient.

1:07:35.485 --> 1:07:37.752
But I'll make sure
it's my top priority.

1:07:37.854 --> 1:07:40.855
In the meantime, promise me
you'll stay away from him.

1:07:40.957 --> 1:07:42.357
- I can't afford to do that.

1:07:43.760 --> 1:07:46.327
(alyssa sighs)

1:07:50.233 --> 1:07:53.234
(keyboard clicking)

1:07:59.109 --> 1:08:02.010
(cellphone chimes)

1:08:05.982 --> 1:08:08.283
(cellphone chimes)

1:08:08.385 --> 1:08:10.952
(alyssa sighs)

1:08:11.054 --> 1:08:14.189
(cellphone rings)

1:08:14.291 --> 1:08:15.523
hey. Did you find anything?

1:08:15.625 --> 1:08:16.958
- Well, yes and no.

1:08:17.060 --> 1:08:19.127
I cross-referenced her name
and date of birth in the system

1:08:19.229 --> 1:08:20.929
and I got a possible match.

1:08:21.031 --> 1:08:22.530
- That's great. Where is she?

1:08:22.632 --> 1:08:24.499
- Deceased, unfortunately.

1:08:24.601 --> 1:08:26.134
- No, that's not possible.

1:08:26.236 --> 1:08:27.669
- Well, I'm afraid it can.

1:08:27.771 --> 1:08:29.571
I mean, miles said he hasn't
heard from her in years, right?

1:08:29.673 --> 1:08:31.406
I mean, it's either that or...

1:08:31.508 --> 1:08:32.373
- [alyssa] or what?

1:08:32.476 --> 1:08:34.309
- Or he's lying to us.

1:08:34.411 --> 1:08:36.611
I don't know, alyssa, you know?
Maybe everyone else's right.

1:08:36.713 --> 1:08:38.313
How much can we
really trust miles?

1:08:38.415 --> 1:08:40.682
- You're talking about a
standard hr computer program

1:08:40.784 --> 1:08:43.051
with limited information.

1:08:43.153 --> 1:08:44.018
And if sophie's been in and out

1:08:44.121 --> 1:08:45.453
of foster care her whole life,

1:08:45.555 --> 1:08:46.421
who knows what kind of mix-ups

1:08:46.523 --> 1:08:48.056
gonna be in her background info?

1:08:48.158 --> 1:08:49.324
- Yeah, I guess.

1:08:50.494 --> 1:08:51.826
- I'll see you in a bit?

1:08:51.928 --> 1:08:54.195
- Okay. Sorry I don't
have better news.

1:08:55.065 --> 1:08:56.064
- Bye.

1:09:00.437 --> 1:09:03.471
(cellphone ringing)

1:09:07.777 --> 1:09:10.145
(door knocking)

1:09:13.650 --> 1:09:15.450
- what, you don't pick
up the phone anymore?

1:09:15.552 --> 1:09:16.918
I've been worried sick.

1:09:17.020 --> 1:09:19.487
I've been calling to find
out how it went with miles.

1:09:19.589 --> 1:09:21.456
I mean, last I knew, you
were rushing out of here

1:09:21.558 --> 1:09:23.391
to go confront him.

1:09:23.493 --> 1:09:24.459
Are you okay?

1:09:29.232 --> 1:09:31.332
- I never noticed
that charm before.

1:09:32.169 --> 1:09:33.067
- What charm?

1:09:33.170 --> 1:09:35.403
- The s charm on your necklace?

1:09:36.606 --> 1:09:37.438
- Oh, yeah.

1:09:38.542 --> 1:09:39.774
S for sarah.

1:09:41.344 --> 1:09:42.544
I got it in college.

1:09:42.646 --> 1:09:44.946
It's kind of cheesy, but
it's my good luck charm.

1:09:45.048 --> 1:09:47.048
- It's identical to
the one sophie wore.

1:09:48.652 --> 1:09:50.051
- Who?

1:09:50.153 --> 1:09:52.854
- It's your job to know my
book better than me, remember?

1:09:52.956 --> 1:09:54.355
- Oh, yeah.

1:09:54.457 --> 1:09:57.759
Duh. I guess I never
thought of it before.

1:09:57.861 --> 1:09:58.459
- Huh.

1:09:59.796 --> 1:10:00.662
That's because I never
actually mentioned it

1:10:00.764 --> 1:10:01.896
in my journals or my book.

1:10:03.900 --> 1:10:06.234
And the one photo I
ever saw of sophie,

1:10:06.336 --> 1:10:08.670
she was wearing
that exact necklace.

1:10:08.772 --> 1:10:12.273
- Well, that's a pretty
crazy coincidence.

1:10:12.375 --> 1:10:13.074
- Is it?

1:10:14.010 --> 1:10:15.410
I mean, how did you just step in

1:10:15.512 --> 1:10:16.878
and replace my previous editor?

1:10:16.980 --> 1:10:17.979
- You know how.

1:10:19.382 --> 1:10:23.718
Honey, she died in an accident.

1:10:23.820 --> 1:10:25.320
- They think it was an accident.

1:10:27.791 --> 1:10:28.890
- What are you saying?

1:10:32.362 --> 1:10:34.662
- Miles believes that
emma's kidnapper is sophie,

1:10:37.100 --> 1:10:38.066
his other daughter.

1:10:41.171 --> 1:10:42.136
- His other daughter?

1:10:43.273 --> 1:10:45.006
- He hasn't seen
her for 30 years,

1:10:45.108 --> 1:10:47.442
but one thing's for sure,
last time he saw her,

1:10:48.745 --> 1:10:50.044
she was wearing that necklace.

1:10:51.681 --> 1:10:53.248
- Listen to what you're saying.

1:10:54.751 --> 1:10:58.119
You're talking about the
man who kidnapped you

1:10:58.221 --> 1:10:59.954
and held you captive
from your real parents.

1:11:00.056 --> 1:11:02.523
- Why aren't you more surprised

1:11:02.626 --> 1:11:04.492
to hear that sophie's
not really dead?

1:11:05.729 --> 1:11:08.596
- Wow, you have become
completely paranoid.

1:11:08.698 --> 1:11:10.031
My name starts
with the letter s,

1:11:10.133 --> 1:11:11.966
so I kidnapped your daughter?

1:11:12.068 --> 1:11:13.601
- I'm not crazy.

1:11:13.703 --> 1:11:15.770
I am perfectly clear
about what I'm saying,

1:11:15.872 --> 1:11:17.605
and I'm perfectly clear
about something else.

1:11:17.707 --> 1:11:19.707
You're off my
book. You're fired.

1:11:21.411 --> 1:11:24.245
- All of this because of
some theory from miles?

1:11:25.382 --> 1:11:27.515
I am the reason that
there is a book!

1:11:27.617 --> 1:11:28.516
- Right, because you found me,

1:11:28.618 --> 1:11:29.984
and I told you everything

1:11:30.086 --> 1:11:30.952
because you prodded me
for detail after detail!

1:11:31.054 --> 1:11:33.054
- It's called being your editor.

1:11:33.156 --> 1:11:35.089
(sarah chuckles)

1:11:35.191 --> 1:11:37.191
I am sorry to tell you this,

1:11:37.294 --> 1:11:39.327
but the world doesn't revolve

1:11:39.429 --> 1:11:42.096
around you and
your trauma, okay?

1:11:42.198 --> 1:11:44.699
You can continue to point
the finger at everybody

1:11:44.801 --> 1:11:45.867
who actually cares about you,

1:11:45.969 --> 1:11:47.502
but eventually, you may
have to come to terms

1:11:47.604 --> 1:11:52.573
with the fact that you
may never see emma again.

1:11:54.778 --> 1:11:57.445
- You were the one who suggested
we go to the park that day.

1:11:57.547 --> 1:11:59.447
And you were the
last one who saw us.

1:12:00.517 --> 1:12:01.849
Where were you
after you left us?

1:12:01.951 --> 1:12:03.351
- This is absurd.

1:12:03.453 --> 1:12:05.286
(sara chuckles)

1:12:05.388 --> 1:12:06.054
I'm leaving.

1:12:07.390 --> 1:12:09.190
Oh, I am not gonna be
accused and interrogated

1:12:09.292 --> 1:12:11.626
by somebody who is
supposed to be my friend.

1:12:20.470 --> 1:12:21.402
- [alyssa] I know.

1:12:22.605 --> 1:12:23.471
I know you told me to
stay away from him,

1:12:23.573 --> 1:12:24.939
but I think I who sophie is,

1:12:25.041 --> 1:12:27.375
and miles is the only
person who can confirm it.

1:12:27.477 --> 1:12:28.710
- [grant] who?

1:12:28.812 --> 1:12:29.811
- I'll let you
know if I'm right.

1:12:29.913 --> 1:12:30.812
- [grant] alyssa,
I'm coming there.

1:12:30.914 --> 1:12:31.779
- No, don't. Please.

1:12:31.881 --> 1:12:32.547
I'll call you back.

1:12:35.318 --> 1:12:37.185
- Hey. What did
you wanna show me?

1:12:38.788 --> 1:12:39.854
- Okay, there is somebody
I never told you about,

1:12:39.956 --> 1:12:41.155
who's new in my life

1:12:41.257 --> 1:12:42.623
and who's spent a lot
of time around emma.

1:12:42.726 --> 1:12:43.558
- Who?

1:12:43.660 --> 1:12:44.559
- If I show you a picture,

1:12:44.661 --> 1:12:45.893
do you think you'd
recognize sophie?

1:12:45.995 --> 1:12:47.495
- Yeah, I think so.

1:12:51.368 --> 1:12:54.335
(gentle music)

1:12:54.437 --> 1:12:56.938
(miles sighs)

1:13:00.210 --> 1:13:01.309
it's her.

1:13:02.312 --> 1:13:03.678
It's sophie.

1:13:03.780 --> 1:13:05.079
How did you-

1:13:05.181 --> 1:13:07.081
- her name's sarah.
She's my book editor.

1:13:07.183 --> 1:13:08.516
It all makes sense now,

1:13:08.618 --> 1:13:10.151
how she randomly
came into my life,

1:13:10.253 --> 1:13:12.186
got close to me,
got close to emma.

1:13:12.922 --> 1:13:14.155
None of this was a coincidence.

1:13:14.257 --> 1:13:15.189
- When was the last
time you saw her?

1:13:15.291 --> 1:13:16.357
- Right before I got here.

1:13:16.459 --> 1:13:18.426
She's been acting
really strange lately.

1:13:18.528 --> 1:13:19.761
And after I saw that
picture of yours,

1:13:19.863 --> 1:13:21.496
I realized she had
the same s pendant.

1:13:22.966 --> 1:13:25.133
I practically accused
her of kidnapping emma.

1:13:25.235 --> 1:13:27.101
- Well, then, she knows
the window is closing.

1:13:27.203 --> 1:13:28.269
She'll be on the move.

1:13:28.371 --> 1:13:30.772
- I know she has her.
We have to find her.

1:13:31.641 --> 1:13:33.374
You're coming, right?

1:13:34.677 --> 1:13:36.644
- Of course. Of course.

1:13:40.784 --> 1:13:43.684
(suspenseful music)

1:13:50.760 --> 1:13:51.793
(door knocking)

1:13:51.895 --> 1:13:53.428
- sarah?!

1:13:53.530 --> 1:13:56.431
(doorknob rattles)

1:14:00.703 --> 1:14:02.687
(window opens)

1:14:02.806 --> 1:14:03.938
(alyssa grunts)

1:14:04.040 --> 1:14:05.206
I'll let you in.

1:14:13.082 --> 1:14:15.817
(lock clicks)

1:14:18.021 --> 1:14:20.822
(gentle music)

1:14:22.926 --> 1:14:23.758
- look.

1:14:27.697 --> 1:14:28.563
- Emma?

1:14:29.666 --> 1:14:32.266
(ominous music)

1:14:47.317 --> 1:14:47.949
emma?

1:14:49.152 --> 1:14:49.817
- [miles] alyssa.

1:14:57.627 --> 1:15:00.094
- She was here.
She was right here.

1:15:03.066 --> 1:15:04.198
Where would she have taken her?

1:15:04.300 --> 1:15:06.033
- I don't know, but they
got out of here fast.

1:15:06.135 --> 1:15:08.503
Let's look around, see
if we can find something.

1:15:09.439 --> 1:15:12.273
(drawers opening)

1:15:19.048 --> 1:15:22.049
(objects clattering)

1:15:24.487 --> 1:15:25.987
oh, my god.
- What?

1:15:27.056 --> 1:15:28.556
What did you find?

1:15:28.658 --> 1:15:31.259
- It's a deed. Sophie
bought our old home.

1:15:31.361 --> 1:15:33.227
- What?
- Yeah, look.

1:15:33.329 --> 1:15:35.162
She bought the entire compound.

1:15:35.265 --> 1:15:37.431
- Why would she do that?
- I have no idea.

1:15:37.534 --> 1:15:40.234
(cellphone ringing)

1:15:40.336 --> 1:15:42.203
- it's grant.

1:15:42.305 --> 1:15:43.437
Hey.

1:15:43.540 --> 1:15:44.572
- [grant] where are you?

1:15:44.674 --> 1:15:46.073
- At sarah's.

1:15:46.175 --> 1:15:47.875
It's her. She has emma.

1:15:47.977 --> 1:15:49.176
- [grant] what?

1:15:49.279 --> 1:15:51.245
- We think we know
where she might've gone.

1:15:52.148 --> 1:15:53.514
- [grant] where?

1:15:53.616 --> 1:15:56.918
- Where miles kept me, an old
artists' colony just off of-

1:15:58.121 --> 1:15:59.453
- 52.
- Exit 52.

1:16:00.924 --> 1:16:02.623
- [grant] I know that place.
Actually, I'm pretty close.

1:16:02.725 --> 1:16:03.624
I'm on my way.
- Wait, no.

1:16:03.726 --> 1:16:04.892
It could be dangerous.

1:16:04.994 --> 1:16:05.960
Wait. Grant!

1:16:07.263 --> 1:16:09.030
Let's go.

1:16:37.427 --> 1:16:39.126
- Grace, hey, I'm
glad I got you.

1:16:39.228 --> 1:16:42.430
I'm out at that abandoned
artists' colony off exit 52.

1:16:42.532 --> 1:16:43.414
Alyssa's on her way.

1:16:43.533 --> 1:16:46.400
We think it's sarah.
(gun fires)

1:16:52.375 --> 1:16:54.308
- [alyssa] oh, my god.

1:16:54.410 --> 1:16:55.843
What happened?

1:16:55.945 --> 1:16:58.112
- I called grace and the police.

1:16:58.214 --> 1:16:59.580
- Who shot you? Was it sarah?

1:16:59.682 --> 1:17:00.881
- I don't know, I didn't see...

1:17:00.984 --> 1:17:02.383
Stay here, stay out of sight.

1:17:02.485 --> 1:17:04.685
- Mommy, mommy!
- Emma!

1:17:04.787 --> 1:17:05.886
- [miles] alyssa, no!

1:17:08.224 --> 1:17:09.890
- [alyssa] emma? Emma?

1:17:09.993 --> 1:17:10.992
- [emma] mommy!

1:17:11.094 --> 1:17:12.026
- Emma!

1:17:12.128 --> 1:17:12.793
Emma!
(gun thuds)

1:17:12.895 --> 1:17:15.696
(thrilling music)

1:17:20.436 --> 1:17:22.470
(gun clatters)
(fireplace poker clangs)

1:17:22.572 --> 1:17:23.938
(kick thuds)

1:17:24.040 --> 1:17:26.741
(dramatic music)

1:17:29.779 --> 1:17:31.812
(knife rasps)

1:17:31.914 --> 1:17:32.913
- get away from her!

1:17:33.016 --> 1:17:34.448
- [sarah] shut up!

1:17:34.550 --> 1:17:36.350
- Stop! Stop.

1:17:36.452 --> 1:17:37.551
It's me you hate.

1:17:37.654 --> 1:17:41.088
- You're right, I hate
your guts. Hers too.

1:17:41.190 --> 1:17:43.524
- I tried to find you. I did.

1:17:44.460 --> 1:17:46.093
But they made it impossible.

1:17:46.195 --> 1:17:48.162
They wouldn't even tell
me where they sent you.

1:17:48.264 --> 1:17:49.830
- No, but what really happened?

1:17:49.932 --> 1:17:51.966
You replaced me, so
you stopped looking.

1:17:52.068 --> 1:17:55.503
- No. I thought you were happy.

1:17:55.605 --> 1:17:57.972
I assumed they sent you
to a wonderful family,

1:17:58.074 --> 1:17:59.707
much better than I
could've ever given you.

1:17:59.809 --> 1:18:00.875
- They didn't.

1:18:00.977 --> 1:18:03.544
- I know, and I'm so sorry.

1:18:03.646 --> 1:18:04.845
(alyssa groans)

1:18:04.947 --> 1:18:06.981
- sure, you're sorry now, huh?

1:18:07.083 --> 1:18:09.917
After you got your do-over
daughter, you know what I got?

1:18:10.019 --> 1:18:12.687
Oh, I got bounced from
foster home to foster home.

1:18:12.789 --> 1:18:15.489
And every night, I
would go to bed hoping

1:18:15.591 --> 1:18:17.458
that you would come and save me.

1:18:17.560 --> 1:18:20.394
All I wanted was to know
that you still loved me.

1:18:20.496 --> 1:18:22.663
- I never stopped
loving you. Never.

1:18:22.765 --> 1:18:26.400
- Yeah. Yeah, but you
loved her more, didn't you?

1:18:26.502 --> 1:18:28.235
Now can you imagine how it feels

1:18:28.337 --> 1:18:30.171
to have your father
tell people you're dead

1:18:30.273 --> 1:18:32.339
so that he can move
on with his life, huh?

1:18:32.442 --> 1:18:35.242
To find out that he called
his new daughter by your name,

1:18:35.344 --> 1:18:37.878
do you know how sick that is?

1:18:37.980 --> 1:18:39.413
- We can't change what happened,

1:18:40.583 --> 1:18:43.050
but we can control
what happens right now.

1:18:44.020 --> 1:18:44.952
What do you want?

1:18:45.054 --> 1:18:47.221
(sarah chuckles)

1:18:47.323 --> 1:18:48.823
- I want you to pay.

1:18:48.925 --> 1:18:49.957
- How, by taking my daughter

1:18:50.059 --> 1:18:50.991
away from me?
- Yes!

1:18:51.094 --> 1:18:52.760
Yes!

1:18:52.862 --> 1:18:54.729
Then, he'll know
he's responsible for
ruining your life

1:18:54.831 --> 1:18:58.032
and making you lose the most
important thing to you, huh?

1:18:58.134 --> 1:19:00.601
And then, you will
finally hate him,

1:19:00.703 --> 1:19:02.570
the way he deserves to be hated.

1:19:03.806 --> 1:19:05.840
- There has to be a way
for us to get past this,

1:19:07.577 --> 1:19:09.443
for us to all walk out of
here and heal from this.

1:19:09.545 --> 1:19:10.578
(sarah chuckles)

1:19:10.680 --> 1:19:11.846
- aww, are you
seriously going all

1:19:11.948 --> 1:19:14.482
dr. Manning on me
right now, huh?

1:19:14.584 --> 1:19:16.283
Did you not hear what
I just said, huh?

1:19:16.385 --> 1:19:18.352
- [miles] why are you
doing this, sophie?

1:19:20.389 --> 1:19:23.057
- Well, it started by
getting rid of sophie

1:19:23.159 --> 1:19:24.458
and vanishing off
the face of the earth

1:19:24.560 --> 1:19:26.427
to be reborn as sarah.

1:19:26.529 --> 1:19:29.563
And then, I just had to find
a way to make alyssa trust me.

1:19:29.665 --> 1:19:31.999
And I realized, oh, who
would she trust more

1:19:32.101 --> 1:19:33.968
than her own editor?

1:19:34.070 --> 1:19:35.903
- Caroline's death wasn't
an accident, was it?

1:19:36.005 --> 1:19:38.873
- Well, she was never gonna
let go of her prized client.

1:19:38.975 --> 1:19:40.174
Fortunately for me,

1:19:40.276 --> 1:19:42.176
her condo balcony is so
slippery in the rain.

1:19:42.278 --> 1:19:43.978
- Why not just kill
me? Why take emma?

1:19:44.080 --> 1:19:45.279
- Her daughter goes missing

1:19:45.381 --> 1:19:46.914
at the same time
as your release?

1:19:47.016 --> 1:19:48.849
Of course, you'd be
the main suspect.

1:19:48.951 --> 1:19:50.985
I just didn't realize
that perfect little alyssa

1:19:51.087 --> 1:19:52.920
actually adhering to all
that forgiveness crap

1:19:53.022 --> 1:19:55.089
she spouts on her podcast.

1:19:55.191 --> 1:19:58.492
God, why can't you
just hate him, huh?

1:19:58.594 --> 1:20:00.694
He deserves it! He
ruined your life too!

1:20:00.797 --> 1:20:04.265
- He didn't ruin my life,
because I didn't let him.

1:20:04.367 --> 1:20:05.032
- Not yet.

1:20:05.835 --> 1:20:06.767
But you will now.

1:20:07.603 --> 1:20:08.502
Come on.

1:20:08.604 --> 1:20:09.537
Move! Go!

1:20:09.639 --> 1:20:12.239
(miles grunts)
- oh.

1:20:12.341 --> 1:20:14.341
- I swear, I will
kill her if you move.

1:20:17.246 --> 1:20:17.778
- Sophie, stop!

1:20:19.081 --> 1:20:20.381
Hurt me.

1:20:20.483 --> 1:20:21.916
Okay? They have nothing
to do with this.

1:20:22.018 --> 1:20:23.517
This was all my fault.

1:20:23.619 --> 1:20:26.453
Please, let's sit down.
Let's talk about it.

1:20:26.556 --> 1:20:29.423
But please, do not hurt her.

1:20:29.525 --> 1:20:34.094
- Of course! Once again,
protecting your precious alyssa.

1:20:35.898 --> 1:20:38.599
You know, I'm taking that one
with me. I'm her mommy now.

1:20:38.701 --> 1:20:39.700
(emma screaming)
- no!

1:20:39.802 --> 1:20:41.202
- [sarah] we are gonna
have so much fun.

1:20:41.304 --> 1:20:42.069
(sarah screams)

1:20:42.171 --> 1:20:43.504
(head thuds)
(sarah screams)

1:20:43.606 --> 1:20:44.305
no!

1:20:45.708 --> 1:20:47.107
(body thuds)

1:20:47.210 --> 1:20:49.510
- [miles] hey.
Are you all right?

1:20:49.612 --> 1:20:50.678
Okay. Come on.

1:20:51.514 --> 1:20:53.280
Here, go to your mommy.

1:20:53.382 --> 1:20:54.415
It's okay.
- Mommy, mommy!

1:20:55.885 --> 1:20:57.418
(emma crying)

1:20:57.520 --> 1:20:58.452
- it's okay.

1:20:59.288 --> 1:21:04.258
It's okay, you're safe.

1:21:13.035 --> 1:21:14.068
- Hey.

1:21:14.170 --> 1:21:15.035
(miles chuckles)

1:21:15.137 --> 1:21:16.503
cream and two sugars?

1:21:16.606 --> 1:21:19.273
(miles chuckles)

1:21:20.276 --> 1:21:21.942
- thanks for meeting me.

1:21:22.044 --> 1:21:23.911
- Yeah. It's good to see you.

1:21:26.582 --> 1:21:28.148
So where's the little one?

1:21:29.418 --> 1:21:31.252
I was hoping to
officially meet her today

1:21:31.354 --> 1:21:33.153
to hopefully get
to know her better.

1:21:33.256 --> 1:21:35.522
(miles chuckles)

1:21:35.625 --> 1:21:36.891
- they're coming, but...

1:21:39.095 --> 1:21:41.662
(gentle music)

1:21:42.798 --> 1:21:45.633
- it's not gonna happen, is it?

1:21:45.735 --> 1:21:48.936
- I've been thinking a
lot the past few weeks,

1:21:49.038 --> 1:21:51.472
and I'm so thankful for
you helping me find emma.

1:21:52.808 --> 1:21:56.543
And I do, I forgive you.

1:21:57.513 --> 1:21:58.312
- Thank you.

1:21:59.315 --> 1:22:01.148
- Not because I
condone your actions,

1:22:01.250 --> 1:22:04.218
but because it's what
I've needed to fully heal.

1:22:08.157 --> 1:22:08.923
Who knew that would
be the lasting result

1:22:09.025 --> 1:22:10.291
of all this nightmare?

1:22:12.128 --> 1:22:13.227
That being said,

1:22:17.500 --> 1:22:20.834
I think it's best if I
officially put you in my past.

1:22:22.838 --> 1:22:24.338
And that includes
you knowing emma.

1:22:29.245 --> 1:22:30.644
- I understand.

1:22:31.714 --> 1:22:33.080
- I'm not your little sophie.

1:22:37.453 --> 1:22:42.389
I'm alyssa, and I need to
leave sophie in the past.

1:22:47.430 --> 1:22:49.563
- I think I need to
do the same thing.

1:22:49.665 --> 1:22:52.366
(miles sighs)

1:22:56.072 --> 1:22:59.106
I will stay out of your
lives. You have my word.

1:22:59.976 --> 1:23:01.041
Goodbye, alyssa.

1:23:03.112 --> 1:23:04.011
- Goodbye.

1:23:14.223 --> 1:23:15.322
- Hi, mommy.

1:23:15.424 --> 1:23:17.424
- Honey, hi. Hi.

1:23:17.526 --> 1:23:19.293
- Can I go ride my hoverboard?

1:23:21.397 --> 1:23:23.030
- Go for it. Yeah.

1:23:23.866 --> 1:23:24.732
- Thank you.

1:23:24.834 --> 1:23:25.833
- Yep, you got it.

1:23:32.575 --> 1:23:33.741
How'd he take it?

1:23:35.444 --> 1:23:36.510
Okay?

1:23:38.748 --> 1:23:39.546
- I'm fine.

1:23:41.250 --> 1:23:44.551
She's safe now, and so am I.

1:23:46.255 --> 1:23:47.221
Come on.

1:23:47.323 --> 1:23:50.257
(both chuckling)
