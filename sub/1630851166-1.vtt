WEBVTT

02:03.993 --> 02:04.950
- Oh, what's that?

02:04.994 --> 02:05.777
- What's what?

02:05.821 --> 02:07.083
- The box with the bow.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.738
- My daughter Sasha's
turning 21 in two days.

02:09.781 --> 02:12.436
Clem's brother's got a
really good hookup resale

02:12.480 --> 02:13.785
in Laughlin.

02:13.829 --> 02:15.222
- You got her a gun?

02:15.265 --> 02:17.049
I just told
you she's turning 21.

02:17.093 --> 02:19.139
- You got her a gun
from a roach coach.

02:19.182 --> 02:21.880
So Clem's one-stop shop for
life shortening and shit?

02:21.924 --> 02:23.491
Cheeseburgers, guns.

02:23.534 --> 02:25.014
Does he deep fry bullets?

02:25.057 --> 02:26.276
- He might.

02:26.320 --> 02:28.060
You can damn near deep
fry anything these days.

02:28.104 --> 02:30.106
- I never got a gun
when I turned 21.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.195
- I don't know what
you talking about.

02:32.239 --> 02:34.197
How much you spend on
that Ruger, rookie?

02:34.241 --> 02:36.156
Which is a single action weapon

02:36.199 --> 02:38.201
from the ass end of the 1800s

02:38.245 --> 02:41.683
and damn near useless in
a 21st century gunfight.

02:41.726 --> 02:43.424
- It's not the brush.

02:43.467 --> 02:45.252
It's the artist.

03:06.273 --> 03:07.665
Fuck!

03:10.277 --> 03:11.191
Units are clear for 10-11.

03:11.234 --> 03:12.235
Possible ABW.

03:12.279 --> 03:14.237
Code five at Indian
Springs Casino.

03:14.281 --> 03:15.107
Unit to clear?

03:15.151 --> 03:16.021
- Shit.
- Three over 20,

03:16.065 --> 03:17.109
responding in route.

03:18.589 --> 03:19.503
- Goddamn it!

03:20.374 --> 03:22.202
Can't even fucking eat in peace.

03:23.290 --> 03:25.074
Can't even enjoy this meal!

03:25.117 --> 03:26.945
Shit!

04:50.333 --> 04:53.249
- This is a fucking mess.

04:56.426 --> 04:59.255
I'm gonna let you
finish that heart attack

04:59.299 --> 05:01.388
and I'm gonna go
protect and serve.

05:01.431 --> 05:02.954
Be
right there, rookie.

05:02.998 --> 05:04.826
I protect and serve
better on a full stomach.

05:04.869 --> 05:06.523
- Hey, break it up!

05:08.090 --> 05:09.483
Break it up!

05:09.526 --> 05:11.920
Break it up, hey, hey!

05:11.963 --> 05:13.704
Break it up, break it up!

05:13.748 --> 05:15.315
She's gonna drop that guy!

05:15.358 --> 05:17.969
Hey, what kind of
wedding is this?

05:23.410 --> 05:26.717
Now which one of you wanna spend
the night in county lockup?

05:28.371 --> 05:29.372
That's what I thought.

05:31.548 --> 05:32.767
- Oh!

05:32.810 --> 05:33.898
- World star!

05:35.857 --> 05:38.076
- I did not mean to lean into
that, lady, I'm really sorry.

05:38.120 --> 05:40.252
- Hands in the air!
- Get on the ground!

05:40.296 --> 05:41.341
- Which one of you
are gonna arrest me?

05:41.384 --> 05:42.516
- Let's go!
- All right,

05:42.559 --> 05:43.430
somebody arrest me!
- Down, down!

05:43.473 --> 05:44.431
On the ground!

05:44.474 --> 05:45.562
Get on the ground!

05:45.606 --> 05:46.998
Will
one of you people

05:47.042 --> 05:48.217
please fucking arrest me--

05:49.436 --> 05:50.219
- Oh!

05:51.046 --> 05:52.439
- Woo!

05:55.616 --> 05:57.357
- You're under arrest.

06:01.491 --> 06:02.710
- Oh my God.

06:41.488 --> 06:43.228
Kim!

06:43.272 --> 06:44.055
- Coming.

06:45.535 --> 06:46.797
Well what do we have here?

06:46.841 --> 06:48.538
- Picked up a boy
toy for you, Kim.

06:48.582 --> 06:49.844
Aren't you
just the sweetest thing

06:49.887 --> 06:51.280
on God' green at 4 A.M.

06:51.323 --> 06:54.457
Look at this pretty blue purse.

06:54.501 --> 06:56.154
Get me cell.

06:56.198 --> 06:57.460
- The only cell you're
getting is the one

06:57.504 --> 06:58.809
you're spending the night in.

07:01.203 --> 07:02.726
Lord, honey, what
happened to your eye?

07:02.770 --> 07:04.511
- This charming man.

07:04.554 --> 07:06.948
Hit a woman?

07:12.388 --> 07:13.650
- Teddy, you're bleeding.

07:15.609 --> 07:16.740
A lot.

07:16.784 --> 07:18.438
- Whoa, what the hell is this?

07:20.527 --> 07:22.311
Bullet
by, he got shot.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.835
Get him
downstairs, get him stitched up.

07:24.879 --> 07:26.968
Maybe the boredom
will get him talking.

07:28.143 --> 07:30.624
- Damn, your momma
didn't love you at all.

07:30.667 --> 07:32.800
My God.

07:32.843 --> 07:34.062
What the fuck?

07:37.979 --> 07:39.328
I mean I know of.

07:39.371 --> 07:41.896
I never watched, I
never watched that.

07:45.421 --> 07:46.335
- Hey!

07:46.378 --> 07:47.858
What the hell is going on?

07:47.902 --> 07:49.469
Who's on intake?

07:49.512 --> 07:52.210
Last week, you's bitching about
not getting enough overtime

07:52.254 --> 07:53.690
and now here you are jawing away

07:53.734 --> 07:55.649
like a bunch of
fucking old ladies!

07:55.692 --> 07:57.259
Get back to work!

07:57.302 --> 07:58.129
- Sorry, Mitchell.

07:58.173 --> 07:59.522
- Sorry, Mitch, my ass.

07:59.566 --> 08:00.610
Officer Huber!

08:01.655 --> 08:03.831
Where the fuck are my
evidence inventories?

08:03.874 --> 08:06.660
The ones I've been
asking for for two weeks.

08:06.703 --> 08:07.965
- I'm on it.

08:08.009 --> 08:09.576
- I'm on it.

08:09.619 --> 08:11.403
I hate that fucking phrase.

08:11.447 --> 08:13.536
I prefer get it fucking done!

08:15.407 --> 08:17.540
Is there some kind
of goddamn inside bet

08:17.584 --> 08:19.542
to raise my damn blood pressure

08:19.586 --> 08:22.545
every fucking second
of every goddamn day?

08:23.633 --> 08:24.852
Looks
like a cop car.

08:24.895 --> 08:26.157
Central
to state, 10, Ottis, 10.

08:26.201 --> 08:27.332
Shit load
of bullets everywhere.

08:27.376 --> 08:28.508
- 10, Ottis, 10.

08:28.551 --> 08:30.205
Windows are busted.

08:30.248 --> 08:31.511
10, Ottis, 10.

08:31.554 --> 08:33.948
- Kim, get the fuck
out the damn bathroom!

08:33.991 --> 08:35.427
Jesus Christ.

08:35.471 --> 08:37.255
Got the bladder of
a fucking toddler.

08:38.561 --> 08:39.431
This is 50, over.

08:39.475 --> 08:42.260
- We have an 11-55 up Area Road.

08:42.304 --> 08:43.479
Found a Crown Vic
with a dash lamp.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.525
I can't find it
registered anywhere.

08:46.438 --> 08:47.570
Vehicle's also shot up.

08:47.614 --> 08:48.789
- Copy, 10, Ottis, 10.

08:48.832 --> 08:50.573
Clarify shot up, please.

08:50.617 --> 08:52.096
Do you mean bullets--
- Hey, stop buddy!

08:52.140 --> 08:53.358
Stop!
- Yeah.

08:53.402 --> 08:54.098
- Shoot, look out!

09:00.104 --> 09:01.584
- What the fuck?

09:01.628 --> 09:04.065
What the fuck?

09:05.240 --> 09:06.676
- 10, Ottis, 10,
is everything okay?

09:10.288 --> 09:11.376
Copy, 10, Ottis, 10.

09:11.420 --> 09:12.856
This is 50, over.

09:12.900 --> 09:14.641
- Bad fucker.

09:14.684 --> 09:16.468
What the fuck?

09:19.863 --> 09:20.647
Stay down!

09:20.690 --> 09:22.736
Stay the fuck down!

09:22.779 --> 09:24.955
What the
fuck is wrong with you?

09:24.999 --> 09:26.391
He's
drunk off his ass.

09:26.435 --> 09:27.610
- 10, Ottis, 10.
- Stand up!

09:27.654 --> 09:29.133
Is everything okay?

09:29.177 --> 09:30.831
- Doing a little drinking
tonight, asshole?

09:32.136 --> 09:33.616
You've been doing a
lot more than a little.

09:33.660 --> 09:34.922
- Damn.

09:34.965 --> 09:36.358
10, Ottis,
10, is everything okay?

09:37.707 --> 09:38.403
You almost
killed a state trooper,

09:38.447 --> 09:39.622
you dumb fuck!

09:39.666 --> 09:40.841
Do you
need assistance?

09:40.884 --> 09:42.233
10, Ottis, 10.

09:42.277 --> 09:44.627
- Get him in there.
- Get in there.

09:44.671 --> 09:46.629
This
is 10, Ottis, 10.

09:46.673 --> 09:48.500
Some goddamn drunk almost
run us down just now.

09:48.544 --> 09:50.764
Can we process him
at your station?

09:50.807 --> 09:52.983
- Yeah, it's a slow
night, bring him down.

09:53.897 --> 09:56.378
- All right, 50, we're at 10-80.

09:56.421 --> 09:57.466
Give us 30 minutes.

09:57.509 --> 09:58.249
All right now.

09:58.293 --> 09:59.860
Out.
- You all right?

10:02.384 --> 10:04.821
- Fucking overtime, my ass.

10:08.869 --> 10:11.654
- You've got
fragmentation here, Teddy.

10:11.698 --> 10:13.569
Someone trying to kill you?

10:13.613 --> 10:16.964
Is that why you were trying
to get arrested tonight?

10:19.227 --> 10:21.272
They got your ass
ice cold, Teddy.

10:22.665 --> 10:24.972
You assaulted an officer,
that's aggravated battery.

10:25.015 --> 10:27.583
That's mandatory
12 to 18 in county.

10:28.932 --> 10:30.891
So I would take
advantage of my minuscule

10:30.934 --> 10:33.197
amount of sympathy
for you getting shot

10:34.677 --> 10:35.852
and talk.

10:43.555 --> 10:46.167
You know, I had this
boyfriend in high school.

10:46.994 --> 10:49.300
Curtis Flores.

10:49.344 --> 10:50.606
My father didn't care for him,

10:50.650 --> 10:52.695
not that he liked
any of my boyfriends,

10:52.739 --> 10:55.480
but he always said about Curtis,

10:55.524 --> 10:57.004
"Honey,

10:57.047 --> 11:00.181
"that boy is never more than
a day ahead of the devil."

11:03.140 --> 11:03.967
Curtis.

11:05.577 --> 11:07.275
- Curtis sounds like a gem.

11:08.537 --> 11:10.147
Whatever happened to him?

11:10.191 --> 11:11.845
- He was stabbed and killed

11:11.888 --> 11:13.673
in the parking lot
of an Applebee's.

11:15.762 --> 11:17.285
He let the day get past him.

11:17.328 --> 11:19.461
And the devil was right there.

11:23.683 --> 11:24.684
Hey, Sarge.

11:24.727 --> 11:25.510
- Hey.

11:26.598 --> 11:27.817
We got an unmarked Crown Vic

11:29.384 --> 11:32.735
full of bullet holes just found
abandoned by state troopers.

11:32.779 --> 11:34.781
That meaning anything
to you, Teddy?

11:41.483 --> 11:42.963
- I want my phone call now.

11:44.921 --> 11:46.140
Operator.

11:46.183 --> 11:47.619
Name of the person
you're trying to reach.

11:47.663 --> 11:48.620
- Lorraine Faith.
- Law enforcement officials--

11:48.664 --> 11:49.796
- F-A-I-T-H.
- Appear no closer

11:49.839 --> 11:50.971
to solving the brutal murder

11:51.014 --> 11:52.929
of Nevada Attorney
General William Fenton,

11:52.973 --> 11:54.278
who was found slain.

11:54.322 --> 11:55.540
- Some of the top
police officers

11:55.584 --> 11:57.412
and detectives on the case.

11:57.455 --> 11:58.369
Please hold.

11:58.413 --> 11:59.675
- Can't release any names.

11:59.719 --> 12:00.850
As you know, we're
still gathering

12:00.894 --> 12:02.547
as much information as possible,

12:02.591 --> 12:05.028
but, rest assured, we will
continue to work very hard

12:05.072 --> 12:06.813
to find the people responsible.

12:06.856 --> 12:08.684
Thank you.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.773
- Come on, fucking pick up.

12:13.689 --> 12:14.951
- Hey, it's Lorraine.
- Fuck!

12:14.995 --> 12:16.648
I can't get
to the phone right now.

12:16.692 --> 12:17.737
Leave a message at the beep.

12:18.825 --> 12:20.740
- Hey, listen, it's me again.

12:20.783 --> 12:23.264
I need you to get the fuck
out of the house, okay?

12:23.307 --> 12:25.440
Take Ryan and go
somewhere, go anywhere.

12:25.483 --> 12:26.702
Do you understand me?

12:26.746 --> 12:28.704
I sent you the combination,
check your texts.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.793
Check your texts, nothing
is safe, nothing is safe.

12:30.837 --> 12:31.620
Time's up, Teddy.

12:31.663 --> 12:32.447
- Nothing.

12:35.145 --> 12:35.929
Okay.

12:40.455 --> 12:41.238
- You can let go.

12:42.109 --> 12:43.763
- I didn't get to her.

12:43.806 --> 12:44.981
- Damn.

12:45.025 --> 12:46.243
Let me
just check my cell.

12:46.287 --> 12:47.027
- You know, how about
you just give me

12:47.070 --> 12:47.984
the code to your cell?

12:48.028 --> 12:49.725
I'll check it for you.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.074
Got something to hide?

12:51.118 --> 12:52.989
Just let
me check my phone.

12:53.033 --> 12:54.034
Let me check my cell.

12:55.252 --> 12:57.385
How's that gonna hurt you?

13:05.741 --> 13:07.177
- All right.

13:07.221 --> 13:10.398
State law requires that we
keep our intoxicated guests

13:10.441 --> 13:11.747
in separate quarters.

13:13.140 --> 13:15.795
So you got the place
all to yourself.

13:17.666 --> 13:18.449
Hands.

13:19.668 --> 13:21.713
- I didn't mean to
hit you so hard.

13:21.757 --> 13:22.932
- Aw, aren't you sweet.

13:23.933 --> 13:25.108
Get comfortable, Teddy.

13:25.152 --> 13:26.675
You're gonna be here awhile.

13:28.677 --> 13:30.940
- Holy shit!

13:30.984 --> 13:32.637
He smells like Satan's asshole.

13:32.681 --> 13:34.378
- Am I home?
- Yeah, this dip shit

13:34.422 --> 13:35.727
nearly killed us.

13:35.771 --> 13:37.773
Bounced his car off
that abandoned Crown Vic

13:37.817 --> 13:39.340
and put it in the ditch.

13:39.383 --> 13:40.776
- All right, well, I'll get
you a lovely night stay in here

13:40.820 --> 13:42.560
on a stainless steel cot

13:42.604 --> 13:43.866
Any ID?

13:43.910 --> 13:45.085
- None.
- Driver's license,

13:45.128 --> 13:46.303
social security?

13:46.347 --> 13:48.044
- What the hell is this?

13:48.088 --> 13:50.046
- All right, John Doe it is.

13:50.090 --> 13:51.743
- What the hell is this?

13:51.787 --> 13:53.267
It's...

13:53.310 --> 13:54.529
My insulin.

13:54.572 --> 13:56.052
What is that?

13:56.096 --> 13:57.401
- Is he saying insulin?

13:57.445 --> 13:58.533
I need
a, I need a shot.

13:58.576 --> 13:59.447
- Talking about diabetes.

13:59.490 --> 14:00.796
You're diabetic, aren't you?

14:01.971 --> 14:03.755
- Not every fat
guy has diabetes.

14:06.062 --> 14:09.718
Can I get a prisoner escort
down to processing, please?

14:09.761 --> 14:11.633
- How is that
workout coming along?

14:11.676 --> 14:13.853
- Oh yeah, I gave
up on the workouts.

14:13.896 --> 14:15.289
Make some
life decisions, man.

14:15.332 --> 14:17.291
Yeah, making the
decision not to work out.

14:22.862 --> 14:23.819
Yeah.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.212
I know.
- Think he shit himself.

14:26.953 --> 14:28.215
No, no, no, no.

14:28.258 --> 14:28.824
We're not in there,
we're not in there.

14:28.868 --> 14:29.869
We're over here.

14:30.870 --> 14:34.090
You guys
stink of booze.

14:34.134 --> 14:35.483
- There you go.

14:37.180 --> 14:40.227
- Yo, I got him.
- Hold him, Ruby.

14:44.709 --> 14:45.449
You okay?

14:45.493 --> 14:46.755
You okay, big guy?

14:47.582 --> 14:48.322
I'm okay.

14:48.365 --> 14:49.323
- All right.

14:52.456 --> 14:53.849
The bunk
is to your right.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.155
- Come on, stop.

14:55.198 --> 14:56.417
Stop.

14:56.460 --> 14:57.331
- He just ate the floor.
- You see that shit?

14:57.374 --> 14:58.854
Hey, it never happened.

14:58.898 --> 14:59.899
You got any food?

14:59.942 --> 15:00.725
I'm famished.

15:00.769 --> 15:01.639
- Just loaf.

15:01.683 --> 15:03.076
- What the hell is loaf?

15:03.119 --> 15:04.904
If you're into dry
dog shit, it's delicious.

15:04.947 --> 15:06.383
- This just ain't
your night, Teddy.

16:02.570 --> 16:04.354
- What are you in for?

16:05.355 --> 16:07.140
- What are you in for?

16:09.925 --> 16:10.970
- I sucker punched a cop.

16:15.583 --> 16:19.282
- No, that's not
what you're in for.

16:19.326 --> 16:21.023
You're in for a
lot more than that.

16:23.939 --> 16:25.593
- What'd you do?

16:25.636 --> 16:27.377
- Did what I had to do...

16:28.944 --> 16:30.119
to get in here.

16:34.819 --> 16:35.951
To get to you, Teddy.

16:38.736 --> 16:41.130
Now, it's important
you listen carefully.

16:41.174 --> 16:42.914
Don't have much time.
- Hey!

16:44.307 --> 16:45.700
Hey!
- Hey, Teddy.

16:45.743 --> 16:46.918
- Somebody!

16:46.962 --> 16:48.224
Hey!
- Listen to me.

16:48.268 --> 16:51.488
914 Glenview Crest,
apartment number 16.

16:52.402 --> 16:54.056
Who lives there?

16:54.100 --> 16:57.364
A woman and a boy.

16:57.407 --> 17:00.019
- What in the fuck are
you guys going on about?

17:01.020 --> 17:02.630
Shut the fuck up!

17:02.673 --> 17:04.458
- I just want my food,
man, I want my food.

17:04.501 --> 17:06.068
- You shouldn't eat
loaf after midnight.

17:06.112 --> 17:08.244
That shit will give
you nightmares!

17:08.288 --> 17:09.332
The big black kind.

17:09.376 --> 17:11.943
- Get me a hotdog.

17:11.987 --> 17:13.032
Please.

17:13.075 --> 17:14.076
- Shut the fuck up!

17:14.120 --> 17:15.730
You guys keep fucking with me,

17:15.773 --> 17:18.602
I'm gonna bring the hose in
on both of y'all bitch asses!

17:18.646 --> 17:19.951
Sorry.

17:31.354 --> 17:33.182
- What do they want?

17:36.316 --> 17:39.014
- You know what they want.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.581
- Can we make a deal?

17:40.624 --> 17:41.408
- Listen, Teddy.

17:43.105 --> 17:46.152
I don't want you to think
that you can save yourself

17:46.195 --> 17:48.067
because you obviously can.

17:51.940 --> 17:54.029
But there are other
considerations.

17:55.683 --> 17:58.903
- Like my ex, is that what
you're talking about, my ex?

17:58.947 --> 18:00.688
Like I give a shit.

18:00.731 --> 18:02.211
The kid ain't even mine, man.

18:12.352 --> 18:13.135
All right.

18:14.354 --> 18:16.182
What guarantees you
give me to spare her?

18:16.225 --> 18:17.487
Huh?

18:17.531 --> 18:19.010
- Guarantees I'm
gonna give, Teddy.

18:20.316 --> 18:22.492
You know how this goes.

18:22.536 --> 18:27.541
All right, it's up to
you where I go next.

18:28.803 --> 18:33.373
- You can't do shit
to me in here, pal.

18:36.245 --> 18:38.682
You know what, actually, you
can't do a fucking thing.

18:43.383 --> 18:46.690
- Okay.

18:46.734 --> 18:47.474
- What okay?

18:47.517 --> 18:48.910
What's that?

18:48.953 --> 18:49.867
What okay?

18:50.781 --> 18:52.261
- It is what it is, Teddy.

18:56.265 --> 18:57.875
- What do you mean,
it is what it is?

19:06.928 --> 19:08.103
My ex and my kid.

19:10.018 --> 19:10.801
They alive?

19:24.728 --> 19:26.208
Officer Huber!

19:26.252 --> 19:27.514
You on a play date or something?

19:27.557 --> 19:30.212
Where the fuck are my
evidence inventories?

20:36.322 --> 20:37.584
- There he is.

20:39.542 --> 20:41.457
Keeping you in the cage.

20:43.154 --> 20:46.201
You finally getting those
inventories straightened out?

20:46.245 --> 20:47.855
- I'm trying.

20:47.898 --> 20:50.466
- Fucking Mitchell wants
everything letter perfect.

20:50.510 --> 20:52.076
- Yeah, it's a pain in my ass.

20:52.120 --> 20:52.860
- Yeah, I bet.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.515
Are you good otherwise?

20:55.558 --> 20:56.472
- Otherwise, what?

20:59.301 --> 21:00.563
- I'm worried about you, man.

21:02.739 --> 21:04.263
- Grown-ass fucking men

21:04.306 --> 21:07.222
don't worry about other
grown-ass fucking men, Barnes.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.615
I'm fine, I'm just...

21:09.703 --> 21:10.573
I'm tired of
Mitchell's bullshit.

21:10.617 --> 21:11.922
- Yeah, I feel you.

21:11.966 --> 21:13.184
He wouldn't do it if
he didn't love you.

21:14.055 --> 21:14.838
- Right.

21:16.362 --> 21:17.798
- Look,

21:17.841 --> 21:19.234
you don't have to tell me but

21:19.278 --> 21:22.324
if you ever need to talk,
chat, shoot the shit,

21:22.368 --> 21:23.673
whatever.
- I'm good, man,

21:23.717 --> 21:25.284
but you don't have
to worry about me.

21:25.327 --> 21:26.067
Okay.

21:26.110 --> 21:27.590
- I'm good.

21:27.634 --> 21:28.678
Law enforcement
officials appear no closer

21:28.722 --> 21:30.201
to solving the brutal murder

21:30.245 --> 21:32.029
of Nevada Attorney
General William Fenton

21:32.073 --> 21:33.596
who was found slain.

21:33.640 --> 21:36.295
- We will continue to work both
at the local and state level

21:36.338 --> 21:38.471
to bring the person
or persons responsible

21:38.514 --> 21:40.386
for these senseless
murders to justice.

21:40.429 --> 21:43.519
- Yeah, first 48, turn
to 72, turn to 96.

21:45.260 --> 21:46.392
It's embarrassing.

21:46.435 --> 21:48.437
Makes only the Attorney
General of Nevada.

21:48.481 --> 21:50.091
- This fucking guy, Murretto,

21:50.134 --> 21:52.920
has been busted more times
than I've made busts.

21:52.963 --> 21:55.401
22 arrests and no charges.

21:55.444 --> 21:56.706
How does that happen?

21:56.750 --> 21:58.229
- There it is.

21:58.273 --> 21:59.318
- What are you doing?

21:59.361 --> 22:01.798
- I'm working on
my rodent roulette.

22:01.842 --> 22:03.409
- Rodent roulette.

22:03.452 --> 22:05.280
- Yeah, see, in Indiana we
used a pistol on everything.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.934
Squirrels, rabbits.

22:06.977 --> 22:08.544
So my dad came up
with this thing.

22:08.588 --> 22:11.417
You take one round, drop
it in the wheel, spin it.

22:11.460 --> 22:13.288
It's gotta land
on that cylinder.

22:14.115 --> 22:15.159
Squirrel shooting.

22:15.203 --> 22:16.378
- And were you any good?

22:16.422 --> 22:18.337
Did you get any squirrels?

22:18.380 --> 22:20.295
I never
did, my dad did.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.601
- Hmm.

22:21.644 --> 22:23.646
So you were a failure in
the eyes of your father?

22:26.388 --> 22:27.868
That tracks.

22:27.911 --> 22:29.173
That's cool.

22:29.217 --> 22:30.392
- See, you're all cocky now

22:30.436 --> 22:32.351
because you got that
fancy Blackhawk.

22:32.394 --> 22:34.004
You didn't think I noticed that?

22:34.048 --> 22:35.876
- Oh, I'm surprised
you noticed it

22:35.919 --> 22:38.400
sitting all comfy,
cozy on my hip.

22:38.444 --> 22:39.749
- I'll quick draw you for it.

22:40.924 --> 22:42.361
My Redhawk

22:42.404 --> 22:44.275
races your Blackhawk.

22:44.319 --> 22:46.234
- I got 30 seconds.

22:47.627 --> 22:49.716
Don't let the Sarge see
us dicking around okay?

22:49.759 --> 22:51.065
Wanna do this?

22:51.108 --> 22:52.414
- Oh yeah.
- Today?

22:54.547 --> 22:55.896
-  All right.

22:55.939 --> 22:57.898
You ready, gunslinger?

22:57.941 --> 23:00.204
- It's your move, cowgirl.

23:03.730 --> 23:05.079
- Ah!
- Ah!

23:07.864 --> 23:09.170
- Officer down.

23:09.213 --> 23:10.345
Officer down.

23:12.956 --> 23:14.915
You know what, speed kills.

23:14.958 --> 23:17.396
- Oh, I can put my
scrubby fingers on it?

23:17.439 --> 23:20.616
- Every time.

23:22.966 --> 23:23.924
Get quicker, man.

23:26.492 --> 23:28.407
- Let Pop see me,
he'd be disappointed.

23:35.544 --> 23:38.025
- I know who you are, pal.

23:38.068 --> 23:39.809
I've heard all about you.

23:42.029 --> 23:43.639
Legendary Bob Viddick.

23:45.511 --> 23:48.470
Some chilling shit
floating around about you.

23:48.514 --> 23:49.819
Some poor bastard in Tampa.

23:51.081 --> 23:52.605
You cut off his arm
with a carving knife

23:52.648 --> 23:55.477
and then you beat him to death
with that same arm, right?

23:58.480 --> 23:59.394
- It was his leg.

24:03.703 --> 24:05.444
I've heard about you too, Teddy.

24:07.315 --> 24:08.534
Say you're very effective.

24:10.231 --> 24:12.320
How you're not dead a
dozen different ways by now

24:12.363 --> 24:15.105
is a cross between a fluke
and a fucking miracle.

24:16.455 --> 24:19.414
- More magic trick
than anything, really.

24:19.458 --> 24:20.459
Mind over matter.

24:22.069 --> 24:23.984
I get people what they want.

24:24.027 --> 24:25.507
- And take more than you need.

24:27.291 --> 24:28.075
- Yeah.

24:29.119 --> 24:30.338
- Hey,

24:30.381 --> 24:31.948
what do you say we
cut all the bullshit?

24:33.602 --> 24:34.516
You wanna live.

24:34.560 --> 24:35.865
- That'd be nice.

24:35.909 --> 24:37.301
- Right, and you still
think that's possible

24:37.345 --> 24:39.826
because you haven't
been paying attention.

24:39.869 --> 24:41.436
So you try to buy your way out.

24:41.480 --> 24:42.655
- Let's make a deal, man,
I got a lot of money.

24:42.698 --> 24:44.613
- You mean the money
you stole from them?

24:46.572 --> 24:48.095
What we fail to
understand, Teddy,

24:48.138 --> 24:50.010
is it's not about
the money anymore.

24:51.533 --> 24:53.840
There's no play here,
Teddy, no deal to be made.

24:55.102 --> 24:56.451
It's a simple choice.

24:56.495 --> 24:57.757
- It's never simple.

25:00.586 --> 25:01.717
- Are you a fucking idiot?

25:03.371 --> 25:04.546
It is that simple.

25:10.247 --> 25:11.640
I'm running out of time, Teddy.

25:12.685 --> 25:14.600
So they're running out of time.

25:16.602 --> 25:17.646
- Huber!

25:17.690 --> 25:19.779
This is fucking bullshit!

25:21.781 --> 25:24.653
Will somebody get fucking
Huber up here, please?

25:37.753 --> 25:38.537
Oh, I'm sorry.

25:38.580 --> 25:39.712
Are you Huber?

25:40.756 --> 25:42.366
- You have an open door policy.

25:42.410 --> 25:44.368
- I also have a no
pain in the ass policy,

25:44.412 --> 25:46.632
but you don't seem to pay
any attention to that.

25:47.502 --> 25:50.592
- 22 arrests, zero convictions.

25:50.636 --> 25:51.680
- Who?

25:51.724 --> 25:53.595
- Our mystery man,
Teddy Murretto.

25:53.639 --> 25:55.597
Have we impounded that
abandoned Crown Vic yet?

25:55.641 --> 25:57.599
- Yeah, I just sent
Ruby and Barnes

25:57.643 --> 25:59.122
out to meet the
tow truck driver.

25:59.166 --> 26:00.646
- Did you read the
state trooper's report?

26:00.689 --> 26:02.909
- Why in the hell would I read
the state trooper's report

26:02.952 --> 26:04.475
when I'm buried in
evidence inventories

26:04.519 --> 26:07.000
that don't make
any goddamn sense?

26:07.043 --> 26:11.221
Will somebody please
get Huber up here now?

26:11.265 --> 26:12.571
- You know, you have a phone.

26:15.008 --> 26:18.446
There was a cherry light and
a siren mount on the dash.

26:18.489 --> 26:19.447
- Okay?

26:19.490 --> 26:21.275
- So here's my theory.

26:21.318 --> 26:23.625
Teddy either stole
that unmarked off a cop

26:23.669 --> 26:25.496
or he's impersonating a cop.

26:25.540 --> 26:27.281
- He's a fucking
total bullshitter.

26:27.324 --> 26:29.936
Wait him out because we
can hold him indefinitely.

26:29.979 --> 26:31.328
- Yeah.

26:31.372 --> 26:32.721
- Huber!

26:32.765 --> 26:35.855
If you are within the
sound of my goddamn voice,

26:35.898 --> 26:37.857
get your big ass up here!

26:37.900 --> 26:39.598
Don't make me come
looking for you!

26:41.121 --> 26:43.297
This motherfucker gonna make
me come looking for him.

26:46.561 --> 26:47.344
Hub!

26:49.346 --> 26:50.783
Huber, you in here?

26:55.048 --> 26:55.831
Shit.

26:57.180 --> 27:00.488
Don't have time for
this fucking shit.

27:00.531 --> 27:02.490
Anybody have eyes on Huber?

27:02.533 --> 27:03.883
Kim, you see him,

27:03.926 --> 27:07.538
tell him to get his ass
in my office right now!

27:14.763 --> 27:17.374
- Listen to me, this
is harassment, okay?

27:18.288 --> 27:20.508
I'm doing everything that I can.

27:20.551 --> 27:21.683
I've probably gotten about

27:21.727 --> 27:23.685
a key and a half
out of evidence.

27:23.729 --> 27:26.122
Do you have any fucking
idea what that entails?

27:26.166 --> 27:27.646
What could happen to me if I...

27:29.299 --> 27:30.518
I know I owe you.

27:33.826 --> 27:34.653
Yes.

27:42.965 --> 27:44.097
What do I need to do?

28:14.127 --> 28:14.910
- Fucking.

28:22.265 --> 28:23.745
Fuck Fireball, dude.

28:27.357 --> 28:30.186
This fucking hangover's gonna
be a motherfucking bitch

28:30.230 --> 28:31.971
if I don't get some
aspirin here too.

28:33.407 --> 28:34.930
- Aspirin is bad for your liver.

28:36.497 --> 28:37.628
- Cool dude, thanks.

28:37.672 --> 28:39.805
You a fucking doctor?

28:39.848 --> 28:40.675
- Yup.

28:41.937 --> 28:44.461
Got my degree from the
University of Common Sense.

28:45.767 --> 28:47.116
- Huh?

28:47.160 --> 28:49.292
- Yeah, I didn't think
you studied there.

28:51.120 --> 28:51.904
- Huh?

28:53.514 --> 28:56.125
- I'm getting a sinking
suspicion that "huh"

28:56.169 --> 28:57.910
is the word that
best describes you.

29:00.564 --> 29:02.697
- I'm getting a
fucking suspicion...

29:02.741 --> 29:06.570
Fucking, fuck you, dude.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.270
What do you got there?

29:12.751 --> 29:14.361
- Just a minute.

29:21.063 --> 29:22.499
- What the fuck?

29:23.762 --> 29:24.937
What the fuck?

29:28.549 --> 29:30.507
- Are you fucking

29:30.551 --> 29:33.684
setting an alarm to remind
you to get your ass kicked?

29:33.728 --> 29:35.469
- I wouldn't poke the bear, pal.

29:37.123 --> 29:37.863
- Huh?

29:37.906 --> 29:39.603
- Oh, there it is again.

29:41.170 --> 29:42.693
- What?

29:42.737 --> 29:43.825
- Oh, that's good, change it up.

29:43.869 --> 29:45.566
"Huh? What?"

29:45.609 --> 29:46.828
Keep 'em guessing.

29:46.872 --> 29:49.439
- Dude.

29:49.483 --> 29:52.268
Don't make me fuck you up
in her, all right, man?

29:52.312 --> 29:54.705
You look like a fucking stepdad.

29:54.749 --> 29:56.229
I will slap the shit out of you.

29:57.447 --> 29:59.449
You're looking at
a real one, son.

29:59.493 --> 30:00.755
I don't give a shit!

30:02.844 --> 30:04.150
You feel me?

30:12.854 --> 30:13.899
- I felt that.

30:13.942 --> 30:15.291
- Hey!

30:16.640 --> 30:17.859
Help!

30:17.903 --> 30:18.817
Hey, somebody help!

30:18.860 --> 30:19.861
Hey!

30:20.688 --> 30:21.471
Help!

30:25.867 --> 30:26.737
- Hey!

30:26.781 --> 30:27.956
- Help!
- Hey!

30:28.000 --> 30:29.218
Hey, help!

30:29.262 --> 30:30.219
- Hey, somebody!

30:30.263 --> 30:31.525
- He's having a seizer!

30:31.568 --> 30:32.439
- False alarm, guys.

30:32.482 --> 30:33.483
I got something that caught fire

30:33.527 --> 30:35.268
in one of these evidence bins.

30:35.311 --> 30:36.486
And can someone please bring me

30:36.530 --> 30:38.706
a fucking fire
extinguisher up here?

30:38.749 --> 30:39.968
We're on it.

30:40.012 --> 30:41.840
- Jesus Christ, that's loud.

30:41.883 --> 30:43.842
What the fuck is happening?

30:43.885 --> 30:44.930
Where you been, Huber?

30:45.800 --> 30:46.845
Sarge looking for you.

30:46.888 --> 30:48.672
- His voice carries.

30:50.196 --> 30:50.936
Hey, who's this?

30:52.851 --> 30:54.896
- That's the douche bag that
clocked Young at the casino.

30:58.247 --> 30:59.683
- Is he still down in holding?

30:59.727 --> 31:00.902
- Help!
- Oh my God!

31:00.946 --> 31:03.513
Somebody come and help this man!

31:03.557 --> 31:04.558
He's gonna die!

31:05.907 --> 31:07.126
- Situation in holding!

31:07.169 --> 31:08.867
Get your ass down
to holding now!

31:11.434 --> 31:12.914
- He's gonna die!

31:15.961 --> 31:17.919
He's gonna die!

31:17.963 --> 31:19.442
He's foaming at the mouth.

31:19.486 --> 31:20.791
- It's not a seizure!
- It's like he's got rabies!

31:20.835 --> 31:21.923
- He did it!

31:21.967 --> 31:22.706
He did it, he did it!

31:22.750 --> 31:23.490
- Oh my gosh!

31:23.533 --> 31:24.883
- Don't go in there!

31:24.926 --> 31:25.971
He's not gonna
make it, please help him!

31:26.014 --> 31:27.755
- What the fuck happened?

31:27.798 --> 31:29.017
- Watch your back!

31:29.061 --> 31:30.236
- Prisoner who doesn't
appear to be breathing.

31:30.279 --> 31:31.933
- Hey, watch your back!

31:31.977 --> 31:33.021
Oh no!

31:40.768 --> 31:41.725
- Oh, shit!

31:41.769 --> 31:42.509
Shit!

31:43.945 --> 31:45.947
We got shots fired,
we got shots fired!

31:45.991 --> 31:46.730
- Help!

31:48.297 --> 31:50.865
Help, he's trying
to fucking kill me!

31:50.909 --> 31:51.910
Somebody!

32:01.484 --> 32:02.964
- You seem to have sobered up.

32:04.618 --> 32:06.272
I'm gonna need you
to drop that gun

32:06.315 --> 32:08.883
and lower yourself as flat as
a board to the floor for me.

32:13.105 --> 32:13.932
- You're shaking.

32:15.237 --> 32:17.457
- Yeah, I'm nervous.

32:17.500 --> 32:20.373
It's amazing I haven't
blown your fucking head off.

32:24.507 --> 32:28.685
You assaulted my sergeant
and are attempting an escape.

32:28.729 --> 32:33.734
There's not a jury in Nevada
that will blah, blah, blah.

32:34.082 --> 32:35.170
Drop

32:35.214 --> 32:36.258
that

32:36.302 --> 32:38.347
fucking gun!

32:39.261 --> 32:40.001
Now!

33:03.546 --> 33:04.286
- All right.

33:09.639 --> 33:11.076
- What the hell happened?

33:11.119 --> 33:13.252
- We need an ambul in here now.

33:13.295 --> 33:14.122
Check Sarge.

33:14.166 --> 33:16.037
Was he shot?

33:16.081 --> 33:18.083
- No but he was attacked.

33:18.126 --> 33:19.910
And get the other guy
up to infirmary now.

33:19.954 --> 33:21.216
He's having trouble breathing.

33:21.260 --> 33:23.262
- Oh shit.
- Laceration to the head.

33:23.305 --> 33:24.828
- Give me a right wrist.

33:26.526 --> 33:28.006
- Anything I can do
to help, officer?

33:28.049 --> 33:30.182
- Yeah, shut the fuck up.

33:30.225 --> 33:31.705
I'll be right
here if you need anything.

33:31.748 --> 33:32.575
Move!

33:33.794 --> 33:35.491
What the fuck are you
looking at him for?

33:35.535 --> 33:36.579
Val, you good?

33:36.623 --> 33:37.798
- Yeah.

33:37.841 --> 33:39.408
Cuff it right
there, to your left.

33:45.545 --> 33:46.328
Show me.

33:47.547 --> 33:48.983
- Wanna check 'em?

33:49.027 --> 33:50.028
- Sit down.

33:54.771 --> 33:55.946
Sarge, sit up.

33:55.990 --> 33:57.731
All right.

33:57.774 --> 33:58.514
Look at me.

33:59.776 --> 34:02.040
All right, I think you
dislocated your jaw.

34:02.083 --> 34:03.215
I'm gonna have to reset it.

34:03.258 --> 34:05.521
I'm gonna stick my
thumbs in your mouth.

34:05.565 --> 34:06.522
One.

34:06.566 --> 34:08.263
Two, three.

34:11.440 --> 34:12.180
Okay.

34:12.224 --> 34:13.573
Let's get up.

34:13.616 --> 34:14.704
Let's get up.

34:16.532 --> 34:18.056
All right, get to the infirmary.

34:26.325 --> 34:27.717
- Get the goddamn door.
- That's what I'm doing!

34:30.590 --> 34:31.460
- Here we go.

34:31.504 --> 34:33.680
All right, all right.

34:33.723 --> 34:34.985
This guy's been like fucking--

34:35.029 --> 34:38.076
- Get him up, up, up to there!

34:41.601 --> 34:42.645
- All right, Sarge, I got you.

34:42.689 --> 34:43.429
Sit her.

34:44.821 --> 34:45.561
- Kimble!
- Huber!

34:45.605 --> 34:46.823
What's with the

34:46.867 --> 34:48.129
fucking ambulance!
- Help Sarge!

34:48.173 --> 34:49.391
Give me a sec,
I'm checking on it.

34:49.435 --> 34:50.479
- This guy's bleeding
like a fucking geyser.

34:50.523 --> 34:51.741
You're
all right, Sarge.

34:51.785 --> 34:52.655
I think his
windpipe is crushed.

34:52.699 --> 34:53.395
- What do you mean it's crushed?

34:53.439 --> 34:55.005
What're you doing?

34:55.049 --> 34:55.745
I'm gonna
have to open up his airway

34:55.789 --> 34:56.659
so he can breathe.

34:56.703 --> 34:57.965
- No, let's wait on the ambul.

34:58.008 --> 34:59.184
Wait
on the ambulance?

34:59.227 --> 35:00.141
- Hey, buddy, buddy,
it's gonna be all right.

35:00.185 --> 35:00.707
Just calm down, just calm down.

35:00.750 --> 35:01.969
It's okay.

35:02.012 --> 35:03.579
Hey, let's just
wait for the doctor.

35:03.623 --> 35:06.104
- All right, I did this in army
medical before on a cadaver.

35:06.147 --> 35:07.192
- On a fucking cadaver?

35:07.235 --> 35:08.018
Was it a cadaver
before you started?

35:08.062 --> 35:09.629
- Are you fucking kidding me?

35:09.672 --> 35:10.978
- I'm nervous, I make bad
jokes when I'm nervous.

35:11.021 --> 35:12.849
- Well refrain, all
right, let me focus.

35:14.677 --> 35:16.244
- Wait, aren't you left-handed?

35:16.288 --> 35:17.202
- Shut the fuck up!
- Fuck yeah,

35:17.245 --> 35:18.159
you're left-handed!

35:18.203 --> 35:19.508
Fuck, just wait, are you sure?

35:19.552 --> 35:21.119
Let's just wait
on the ambulance.

35:21.162 --> 35:22.598
Oh gosh.

35:28.561 --> 35:29.301
- Okay.

35:29.344 --> 35:30.128
- Oh.

35:31.738 --> 35:32.739
- All right.

35:42.314 --> 35:43.706
- Want me to steady that?

35:43.750 --> 35:44.707
- Yeah.

35:44.751 --> 35:45.795
- Oh, he's breathing.

35:45.839 --> 35:46.622
Is he breathing?

35:48.363 --> 35:49.799
Hey, we did...

35:49.843 --> 35:50.583
We did it.

35:50.626 --> 35:52.106
That's how you...

35:52.150 --> 35:53.194
- All right.

35:53.238 --> 35:54.152
That was
fucking badass.

35:54.195 --> 35:55.283
- Keep an eye on him.

35:55.327 --> 35:56.154
- That was fucking
badass, seriously.

36:01.289 --> 36:02.595
- Hey.

36:02.638 --> 36:04.205
This is Huber.

36:04.249 --> 36:05.206
I was told to call you.

36:07.426 --> 36:08.209
Yeah.

36:09.254 --> 36:10.298
Yes.

36:20.308 --> 36:21.135
Kim?

36:49.598 --> 36:50.817
Fuck.

36:50.860 --> 36:51.687
Ah-ooo-gah!

36:51.731 --> 36:52.993
- Jesus fuck, Kimble!

36:53.036 --> 36:54.647
Don't do that.

36:55.909 --> 36:58.346
- Motherfucker, what
are you in my biz for?

36:58.390 --> 36:59.608
- How long does it take for

36:59.652 --> 37:01.349
IAFIS to turn around
prints, usually?

37:02.481 --> 37:04.265
- They don't prioritize DUIs.

37:04.309 --> 37:05.223
- What does that mean?

37:05.266 --> 37:06.136
- It's gonna take awhile.

37:06.180 --> 37:08.051
What's got you so curious?

37:09.314 --> 37:10.315
- Curiosity.

37:36.950 --> 37:38.865
- Let's you and me
talk, man to man.

37:43.173 --> 37:45.611
- Never more than a day
ahead of the devil, huh?

37:47.265 --> 37:48.222
- Tell me, Teddy.

37:49.267 --> 37:50.703
Tell you what?

37:50.746 --> 37:53.140
- Tell me why Mr. Meryl
Streep, back there,

37:53.183 --> 37:56.448
faked a DUI to get
into this station

37:56.491 --> 37:58.363
for a shot at killing you.

37:58.406 --> 37:59.146
- I don't know.

37:59.189 --> 38:00.887
Why don't you ask him?

38:00.930 --> 38:01.714
Bob Viddick.

38:04.847 --> 38:07.023
- Why are you
trying to kill him?

38:07.067 --> 38:07.937
- What do you care?

38:07.981 --> 38:09.112
You don't even like him.

38:14.727 --> 38:17.251
- Why is he trying
to kill you, Teddy?

38:20.646 --> 38:21.429
Okay.

38:22.604 --> 38:23.779
Let's do this.

38:24.650 --> 38:26.260
You can tell me everything,

38:26.304 --> 38:29.045
and I mean every
last fucking thing,

38:30.308 --> 38:33.311
or option two, you can
keep smart-assing me,

38:33.354 --> 38:34.877
shrugging off my questions with

38:34.921 --> 38:37.445
that stupid fucking
look on your face,

38:38.751 --> 38:41.319
and I'll put you and your pal
in the same cell together.

38:42.668 --> 38:44.234
- You're not gonna do that.

38:46.280 --> 38:47.368
Let's not be ridiculous.

38:48.326 --> 38:50.066
Seriously.

38:50.110 --> 38:51.372
You can't do it.

38:51.416 --> 38:52.939
You're not allowed
to do it, remember?

38:52.982 --> 38:54.244
Stop fucking around.

38:54.288 --> 38:56.377
- I'm as far away
from fucking around

38:56.421 --> 38:57.987
as you can possibly get!

38:58.727 --> 38:59.902
You still drunk?

39:01.034 --> 39:02.340
- Sober as a judge.

39:03.384 --> 39:04.167
- Hmm.

39:04.211 --> 39:05.386
You gonna fuck with me?

39:05.430 --> 39:06.953
- Nope.

39:06.996 --> 39:08.346
Not you.

39:08.389 --> 39:09.869
- Problem solved.

39:09.912 --> 39:11.523
- Look, this is way
beyond anything you want

39:11.566 --> 39:13.133
to get involved with, lady.

39:13.176 --> 39:15.265
You don't fucking understand.
- No, you don't understand

39:15.309 --> 39:17.790
how incredibly
fucking bored I am.

39:22.838 --> 39:23.883
- Okay.

39:23.926 --> 39:24.710
Fuck it.

39:26.059 --> 39:26.842
You want to know?

39:32.457 --> 39:33.545
I'll tell you.

39:35.503 --> 39:37.853
All right, what I
do, my profession.

39:37.897 --> 39:39.420
I put people together,

39:39.464 --> 39:42.423
high profile people,
like-minded, shared interests.

39:42.467 --> 39:43.903
Movers and shakers kind of shit.

39:43.946 --> 39:47.123
Cops, politicians,
entrepreneurs, heads of state.

39:47.167 --> 39:48.864
I handled them all.

39:48.908 --> 39:50.779
Call it high-end consultancy.

39:50.823 --> 39:52.302
- You're a fixer.

39:52.346 --> 39:54.000
- No, I hate that fucking
term, I don't fix.

39:54.043 --> 39:56.872
I manufacturing opportunities.

39:56.916 --> 39:58.787
- She doesn't have
to get hurt, Teddy.

40:00.920 --> 40:02.095
What he knows,

40:03.357 --> 40:04.489
you don't need to know.

40:07.100 --> 40:08.406
- I'm all ears.

40:13.759 --> 40:15.108
- You read the papers?

40:15.151 --> 40:16.849
- That's mostly what I do here.

40:18.154 --> 40:20.069
- So you know about the
Nevada attorney general

40:20.113 --> 40:21.854
that was murdered
last week, Fenton?

40:24.987 --> 40:26.293
Bill, motion's done.

40:26.336 --> 40:27.512
Now, the
people I work for,

40:27.555 --> 40:28.948
they got their hooks
into everything.

40:28.991 --> 40:30.558
Just need you
to sign it so I can file.

40:30.602 --> 40:32.517
And when
I say everything in
the state of Nevada,

40:32.560 --> 40:33.474
I'm talking about

40:33.518 --> 40:34.780
the gaming industry.

40:36.434 --> 40:38.000
Oh my God!

40:38.044 --> 40:40.133
- That is the summit from which
everything else flows forth.

40:41.351 --> 40:42.788
Now my job is simple.

40:42.831 --> 40:45.007
I keep them talking,
I keep them happy.

40:45.051 --> 40:46.487
This guy, Fenton, ah,

40:47.793 --> 40:49.229
he was a crusader.

40:49.272 --> 40:51.492
- So you tried to buy him off.

40:51.536 --> 40:53.276
Multiple times.

40:53.320 --> 40:54.408
- And he wasn't biting.

40:54.452 --> 40:55.975
- Not even a nibble.

40:56.018 --> 40:59.761
But when they clipped Fenton,
walls came crumbling down.

40:59.805 --> 41:02.068
He recorded everything
I said with him

41:02.111 --> 41:04.244
and he used that as
leverage to get me to roll.

41:04.287 --> 41:06.551
- Teddy, you're about
to purger yourself

41:06.594 --> 41:10.468
with people that will butcher
your entire fucking bloodline!

41:13.253 --> 41:14.907
- If you don't come clean,

41:15.690 --> 41:17.649
I can't help you.

41:20.565 --> 41:21.914
- The feds offered me a deal.

41:23.002 --> 41:23.872
I took the deal.

41:25.439 --> 41:27.136
- What kind of deal?

41:27.180 --> 41:27.963
- Reciprocal.

41:29.095 --> 41:30.183
I'm invisible, that's
what I'm gonna--

41:30.226 --> 41:31.619
Get people to turn.

41:31.663 --> 41:32.664
What do you mean, what the
fuck am I talking about?

41:32.707 --> 41:33.969
I got the heat all over me.

41:34.013 --> 41:36.494
High level people with
their hands in the mix.

41:36.537 --> 41:38.321
Listen to me, don't bust my
balls on this, all right?

41:38.365 --> 41:41.586
And then one night, I
almost got accidented.

41:46.852 --> 41:48.288
- What does that mean?

41:51.204 --> 41:52.945
They almost
blew me the fuck up.

41:57.906 --> 41:59.691
So I had to go underground.

41:59.734 --> 42:00.518
Disappear.

42:02.389 --> 42:04.522
- Why don't you tell her
about the money, Teddy?

42:04.565 --> 42:06.698
I haven't heard you
mention the money once.

42:07.612 --> 42:08.787
- What money?

42:08.830 --> 42:11.441
- Go on, Teddy, now
that we're all sharing.

42:11.485 --> 42:13.487
Tell her about the
millions you siphoned off

42:13.531 --> 42:15.576
and stashed away somewhere.

42:15.620 --> 42:16.577
- The feds knew about the money.

42:16.621 --> 42:17.491
- Bullshit.

42:17.535 --> 42:19.058
It's not bullshit.

42:19.101 --> 42:21.887
- Lady, this guy will
roll in your fucking guts

42:21.930 --> 42:23.236
given the opportunity.

42:24.585 --> 42:27.196
- I'll take my chances.

42:27.240 --> 42:29.459
- Hard chargers
get charged hard.

42:32.419 --> 42:33.551
- What does that mean?

42:33.594 --> 42:34.726
- You don't know?

42:35.857 --> 42:37.511
It means, if you push too much

42:37.555 --> 42:39.557
then you get pushed back hard.

42:39.600 --> 42:40.949
But that doesn't sound as cool.

42:40.993 --> 42:42.298
- But it's meant to be helpful.

42:42.342 --> 42:43.735
- What the fuck do you
think I said it for?

42:43.778 --> 42:46.085
- Okay, well, all
right, thank you.

42:46.128 --> 42:46.912
Thank you.

42:48.827 --> 42:50.263
All right.

42:50.306 --> 42:53.614
Take me through
the last 24 hours.

42:53.658 --> 42:54.876
The gunshot wound,

42:54.920 --> 42:56.051
the Crown Vic,

42:56.095 --> 42:57.270
et cetera.

42:57.313 --> 42:58.314
All of it.

42:59.838 --> 43:01.883
A pair of Vegas'
finest drove me out of town to,

43:01.927 --> 43:05.626
quote, "deliver me
to the FBI," unquote.

43:05.670 --> 43:06.584
It was bullshit.

43:07.759 --> 43:09.630
These cops are bent.

43:09.674 --> 43:11.589
I had a date with a
hole in the desert.

43:12.633 --> 43:13.808
Thank God the feds
were shadowing me

43:13.852 --> 43:15.375
or I'd been totally fucked.

43:16.681 --> 43:17.420
FBI!

43:17.464 --> 43:18.770
Hey! Hey!

43:18.813 --> 43:19.858
Drop your weapons!

43:19.901 --> 43:20.685
Goddamn it!

43:29.084 --> 43:30.695
Oh, what the fuck?

43:33.480 --> 43:35.351
Stop him!

43:49.452 --> 43:50.236
- Fuck!

44:01.639 --> 44:05.686
Teddy Murretto does
not die, motherfucker!

44:05.730 --> 44:06.905
This is
Young, down in holding.

44:06.948 --> 44:07.688
Kim, you around?

44:07.732 --> 44:08.994
- Right here, sugar.

44:09.037 --> 44:11.344
Are Barnes
and Ruby still off site?

44:11.387 --> 44:12.693
- Uh.

44:12.737 --> 44:14.695
They're on their way
back with a tow truck.

44:14.739 --> 44:16.828
- All right, have the tow
truck continue on here

44:16.871 --> 44:19.613
but ask Barnes and Ruby
if they can reroute

44:19.657 --> 44:23.573
to the old Nomad
Motel out on Route 95,

44:23.617 --> 44:25.619
just north of Lee Canyon.

44:25.663 --> 44:28.883
Possible crime scene,
multiple shooting victims.

44:28.927 --> 44:30.493
There hasn't
been a call out.

44:30.537 --> 44:33.496
- I know, just have them
radio once they're on scene.

44:35.498 --> 44:37.065
- It's gonna be
all right, Sarge.

44:38.763 --> 44:40.678
We're going to take
care of everything.

44:47.554 --> 44:49.643
- How you feeling, Sarge?

44:51.689 --> 44:52.690
All right.

44:54.082 --> 44:54.866
He good?

44:56.781 --> 44:58.783
- Yeah, yeah, he's
still breathing.

44:58.826 --> 45:00.698
Is that ambulance
coming from Reno?

45:00.741 --> 45:02.569
They're fucking taking forever.

45:02.612 --> 45:04.353
- I'll ask Kimble
to call them again.

45:05.311 --> 45:06.791
Don't let him fall asleep.

45:06.834 --> 45:08.140
I got him.

45:13.798 --> 45:15.582
- Six, Charles, 12,
this is central.

45:15.625 --> 45:16.496
It's Barnes.

45:16.539 --> 45:17.410
- Barnes, give me one second,

45:17.453 --> 45:18.237
I got Young coming up right now.

45:18.280 --> 45:19.673
Kim?

45:19.717 --> 45:21.196
I got
Barnes at the motel.

45:21.240 --> 45:23.416
- All right, I need you to
find that ambul for me, please.

45:23.459 --> 45:24.809
- Got it.

45:24.852 --> 45:26.332
- Barnes.

45:26.375 --> 45:27.855
- Yeah, Young, what're we
supposed to be seeing out here?

45:27.899 --> 45:29.596
- Any signs of a shootout?

45:30.684 --> 45:32.991
Shell casings, blood spatter,

45:33.034 --> 45:34.296
drag marks.

45:34.340 --> 45:35.733
- Need an update on
ambulance, please.

45:35.776 --> 45:36.777
No, nothing.

45:36.821 --> 45:38.300
- All right, thanks.

45:39.780 --> 45:42.000
- About 10 minutes
on that ambulance.

45:42.043 --> 45:43.784
Bad accident on
the 15, southbound.

45:43.828 --> 45:45.220
Backed up traffic.

45:45.264 --> 45:46.744
- Okay, can you do me a
favor and run a name for me?

45:46.787 --> 45:48.963
Bob, or Robert, Viddick.

45:49.007 --> 45:50.704
Try spelling variations
on that last name.

45:50.748 --> 45:52.662
- Who is he?

45:52.706 --> 45:54.839
- I think he might be
our John Doe downstairs.

45:54.882 --> 45:56.536
Have the scans sent
back from my office?

45:56.579 --> 45:57.580
- No, not yet.

45:57.624 --> 45:58.668
Huber already asked.

46:00.105 --> 46:00.845
- About what?

46:00.888 --> 46:02.411
- The prints, John Doe.

46:03.586 --> 46:05.719
- Why the fuck is Huber
asking about that?

46:06.938 --> 46:09.549
- Can I ask you a
personal question, Teddy?

46:09.592 --> 46:11.725
I don't see why not.

46:11.769 --> 46:13.248
- You had it all.

46:14.815 --> 46:17.383
They took good care
of you, didn't they?

46:17.426 --> 46:19.080
Money, women, whatever.

46:20.255 --> 46:22.127
Why in the hell would
you give that up?

46:23.302 --> 46:24.694
You could've kept going.

46:24.738 --> 46:27.132
You know, they would've
never let you go down.

46:27.175 --> 46:29.699
You'd never see the
inside of a courtroom

46:30.918 --> 46:31.876
or that cell.

46:34.487 --> 46:35.836
You should've just kept going.

46:37.620 --> 46:39.187
- I don't do shoulda,
woulda, coulda.

46:39.231 --> 46:42.147
- No, you just light your
entire fucking life on fire,

46:42.190 --> 46:45.498
run as fast as you can, hoping
that'll put out the flames.

46:48.327 --> 46:50.242
- You know what
you've never been?

46:50.285 --> 46:51.069
Not once.

46:52.722 --> 46:54.072
- Tell me, Teddy.

46:54.115 --> 46:55.464
- You never been forced
down a fucking rabbit hole,

46:55.508 --> 46:57.858
making life and
death decisions, Bob.

46:57.902 --> 46:59.904
- I do that every fucking day,

46:59.947 --> 47:01.906
Teddy.
- No, you don't.

47:03.342 --> 47:06.388
Those aren't decisions,
those directives.

47:06.432 --> 47:08.216
Kill this guy, kill that guy.

47:08.260 --> 47:11.654
Wipe out that family,
fucking vanish another one.

47:11.698 --> 47:14.135
You're a psychopath,
Bob, plain and simple.

47:15.702 --> 47:17.747
- I'm not a psychopath, Teddy.

47:17.791 --> 47:18.836
I'm a professional.

47:20.620 --> 47:21.795
- And there's a difference?

47:22.927 --> 47:24.711
- You'll know it
when you see it.

47:24.754 --> 47:27.714
What about
this other guy, Viddick?

47:27.757 --> 47:29.542
- I'm not familiar with him.

47:29.585 --> 47:31.152
Probably a cut-out.

47:31.196 --> 47:31.979
Notched.

47:33.198 --> 47:35.069
Mob mostly contracts
third party participants

47:35.113 --> 47:36.897
for heavy lifting like this.

47:36.941 --> 47:39.247
These are distinctly
bad people, officer.

47:39.291 --> 47:41.859
So the quicker we can get
Murretto moved, the better.

47:43.425 --> 47:45.906
We found the bodies of his
ex-wife and son last night,

47:45.950 --> 47:47.995
floating in a runoff
slew near Lake Mead.

47:49.867 --> 47:51.085
- Shit.

47:51.129 --> 47:53.479
- Listen, Teddy Murretto
has made more enemies

47:53.522 --> 47:55.437
than I can count.

47:55.481 --> 47:56.221
So,

47:57.439 --> 47:58.919
what did he tell you
about this little

47:58.963 --> 48:00.834
daring escape he pulled off?

48:02.009 --> 48:03.489
Said a
pair of crooked cops

48:03.532 --> 48:06.231
got ambushed by the feds and
touched off a big gunfight.

48:06.274 --> 48:08.624
Have you turned up
anything on that?

48:08.668 --> 48:09.930
- No.

48:11.932 --> 48:12.890
Not a thing.

48:15.980 --> 48:16.763
- Thank you.

48:20.071 --> 48:21.420
That's it.

48:21.463 --> 48:22.247
Yeah.

48:22.290 --> 48:23.074
All right.

48:34.999 --> 48:38.045
- Yeah, we got a
big fucking problem.

48:39.699 --> 48:42.223
We got a cop in Gun Creek asking
too many fucking questions.

48:48.751 --> 48:49.665
- My kid okay?

48:49.709 --> 48:52.494
You get in contact with my ex?

48:52.538 --> 48:55.019
- I talked to a
detective at Vegas PD

48:55.062 --> 48:58.413
and they're gonna send a
car and do a wellness check.

48:58.457 --> 48:59.849
I'm sure everything's fine.

49:01.808 --> 49:03.375
- Let me check my cellphone.

49:03.418 --> 49:04.680
- You can't check

49:04.724 --> 49:05.899
your cellphone, Teddy.
- Let me just check it.

49:05.943 --> 49:06.813
- Let me check it.
- I'm sorry.

49:06.856 --> 49:07.901
- She's got information from me

49:07.945 --> 49:09.424
that could put her
in danger, okay.

49:09.468 --> 49:10.730
- When Vegas PD--
- She's probably trying--

49:10.773 --> 49:12.123
- reaches back out--
- text me or call me,

49:12.166 --> 49:13.515
she doesn't know what to do.
- I'll let you know.

49:15.300 --> 49:16.388
I'll let you know.

49:33.927 --> 49:35.102
- Robert K. Viddick.

49:35.146 --> 49:38.192
Known associates.

49:38.236 --> 49:40.064
What do we have here?

49:52.076 --> 49:55.079
Well don't these guys look like
a bunch of fucking assholes.

50:11.791 --> 50:14.054
Anthony Lamb.

50:14.098 --> 50:16.665
What kind of jerk
off name is that?

50:16.709 --> 50:20.756
Manslaughter, assault with
a deadly weapon, battery.

50:23.977 --> 50:26.371
- I have birthday
balloon bouquet for

50:26.414 --> 50:28.460
Officer Huber.

50:30.679 --> 50:33.030
- You look just like this
fucking ass bag down here.

50:33.073 --> 50:34.422
Oh, come on, now.

50:34.466 --> 50:35.380
You're kidding.

50:35.423 --> 50:36.990
- No, you gotta check this out.

50:37.034 --> 50:38.035
Look at this.
- What?

50:38.078 --> 50:39.253
- You look just like him.

50:40.950 --> 50:42.865
The resemblance is
fucking uncanny.

50:42.909 --> 50:44.780
- Now what are the odds?

50:47.783 --> 50:48.871
Oh!

50:48.915 --> 50:49.959
Hold on there, buddy.

50:50.003 --> 50:51.091
Hold steady now.

50:51.135 --> 50:53.441
Oh, the boat's a rockin'.

50:55.008 --> 50:56.836
Oh, I'd love to know what's
going through your mind.

51:00.448 --> 51:02.450
Sorry,
guy, traffic was a bitch.

51:02.494 --> 51:03.756
What do we got?

51:03.799 --> 51:05.627
- Thank God you're here,
he took quite a spill.

51:05.671 --> 51:06.933
He's right back here.

51:08.674 --> 51:09.544
Holy shit.

51:09.588 --> 51:11.155
Check vitals.

51:11.198 --> 51:12.591
I got no pulse.

51:12.634 --> 51:13.374
You say...

51:13.418 --> 51:14.332
You say he fell?

51:14.375 --> 51:15.333
- Yeah.

51:15.376 --> 51:17.117
Yeah, well, to clarify,

51:17.161 --> 51:20.164
I shot him in the head and
then he took a little tumble.

51:24.951 --> 51:26.083
Woo.

51:26.126 --> 51:26.909
Dang.

51:28.085 --> 51:29.086
What?

51:30.478 --> 51:31.262
Are you?

51:33.177 --> 51:34.830
Is that your blood
right on my head,

51:34.874 --> 51:37.137
where I shot you on your head?

51:37.181 --> 51:38.312
Imagine that.

51:39.879 --> 51:41.141
Anthony J. Lamb,

51:41.185 --> 51:43.622
you gotta buy yourself
a lottery ticket today.

51:44.840 --> 51:46.712
Oh, I hope they're
power balling.

51:50.324 --> 51:51.325
- Kimble!

51:51.369 --> 51:53.806
Where the fuck's
that ambul, man?

51:53.849 --> 51:54.589
Oh, shit.

51:55.547 --> 51:56.461
What the fuck?

51:56.504 --> 51:57.723
Hey, who the fuck are you?

51:57.766 --> 51:58.985
- Hey, hey, I'm
calling for help, man!

51:59.028 --> 51:59.725
Easy, easy, easy!

51:59.768 --> 52:00.639
- Goddamn!

52:00.682 --> 52:01.553
- What the fuck happened?

52:01.596 --> 52:03.032
- I'm just the balloon man, man.

52:03.076 --> 52:05.209
I'm calling for help, buddy.

52:07.950 --> 52:09.256
Goddamn, son.

52:13.478 --> 52:15.044
Didn't you?

52:15.088 --> 52:17.221
What is the first
rule of policing, huh?

52:18.222 --> 52:21.225
Beware the unusual element.

52:21.268 --> 52:24.097
And in this scenario, I
believe that it is me.

52:24.141 --> 52:28.710
Officer, well, officer
formerly known as...

52:28.754 --> 52:30.277
Pena.

52:30.321 --> 52:31.757
Pena.

52:31.800 --> 52:33.585
- Get down, motherfucker!

52:33.628 --> 52:34.673
Flat as a board!

52:34.716 --> 52:38.155
Get--

52:38.198 --> 52:39.895
- What the fuck was that?

52:46.772 --> 52:48.295
- I used to be a
much better man.

53:26.551 --> 53:28.988
- What the fuck was that?

54:04.023 --> 54:05.242
- No shit now.

54:39.363 --> 54:40.146
Hola!

54:40.973 --> 54:41.713
Well, that fucking blew.

54:53.246 --> 54:54.291
- How bad is it?

54:56.293 --> 54:58.251
- You happen to hear
all that gunfire?

54:58.295 --> 54:59.948
Are you a fucking idiot, Teddy?

54:59.992 --> 55:02.647
- That question persists.

55:02.690 --> 55:05.693
- I ain't talking
about the gunfire.

55:08.000 --> 55:08.783
- Fuck me.

55:13.353 --> 55:14.398
- Oh, fuck.

55:14.441 --> 55:17.488
- You gotta be
fucking shitting me.

55:22.014 --> 55:23.407
Guy was firing what looked like

55:23.450 --> 55:25.147
a snug-barreled submachine gun.

55:25.191 --> 55:27.454
Those use nine millimeter ammo.

55:29.238 --> 55:31.328
This bullet in my stomach

55:31.371 --> 55:33.460
is a 44 caliber...

55:34.505 --> 55:35.332
rico.

55:36.855 --> 55:38.073
- What does that mean?

55:38.117 --> 55:39.031
- Ricochet.

55:40.380 --> 55:42.121
It means she shot herself.

55:45.342 --> 55:48.475
- It means I
fucking shot myself.

55:48.519 --> 55:49.607
- Yeah,

55:49.650 --> 55:50.956
it's me.

55:50.999 --> 55:53.088
Come let me out
of the cell, okay?

55:53.132 --> 55:54.351
You don't know what's
going on up there

55:54.394 --> 55:55.308
and you are wounded bad.

55:55.352 --> 55:56.396
You're gonna bleed out.

55:56.440 --> 55:58.442
Young, you know me.

55:58.485 --> 55:59.878
- This is Young.

55:59.921 --> 56:02.359
I'm trapped down here in
holding with two detainees

56:02.402 --> 56:04.012
and I've been shot
in the abdomen.

56:07.494 --> 56:10.192
Pena and Kimble
have been killed.

56:11.716 --> 56:13.152
Be aware.

56:13.195 --> 56:15.284
We have an armed
assailant on site.

56:16.547 --> 56:18.549
He is outside the cell
block at present, over.

56:28.863 --> 56:29.647
- Damn.

56:31.300 --> 56:33.433
Young, you
don't have much time.

56:33.477 --> 56:34.869
You're bleeding out.

56:34.913 --> 56:37.872
Get me out of this cell,
come on, I can help you.

56:37.916 --> 56:39.091
You have no idea what's
going on up there.

56:39.134 --> 56:40.440
You ware wounded badly.

56:40.484 --> 56:43.182
Get me the fuck out of here.

56:44.531 --> 56:45.837
Ouch.

56:53.540 --> 56:54.933
- Damn.

56:54.976 --> 56:58.458
Now that does appear
to be bulletproof.

57:01.374 --> 57:02.680
Goddamn!

57:02.723 --> 57:04.203
Woo!

57:07.336 --> 57:08.425
- Anthony Lamb.

57:09.600 --> 57:11.602
- Is that big, bad Bob Viddick?

57:11.645 --> 57:14.866
Sideshow Bob, what the fuck
are you doing in there?

57:16.650 --> 57:18.435
- You know this whack job?

57:18.478 --> 57:19.653
- Yeah, he's...

57:21.525 --> 57:23.483
- Young miss law-and-order,

57:23.527 --> 57:26.399
how about you open his door,
we wrap this up real quick

57:26.443 --> 57:28.967
and I get the hell out
your hair toot sweet, huh?

57:31.230 --> 57:32.492
Theodore Murretto.

57:33.493 --> 57:35.364
I'll be a fucking
monkey's uncle.

57:35.408 --> 57:36.975
Look at you in there.

57:37.018 --> 57:40.195
One of male grooming's
greatest misfires,

57:40.239 --> 57:42.067
the man bun.

57:42.110 --> 57:44.461
You look like Tom Cruise
in that Samurai picture

57:44.504 --> 57:45.940
that nobody watched.

57:47.159 --> 57:48.508
Goddamn.

57:48.552 --> 57:50.162
Bob, what's happening in there?

57:50.205 --> 57:52.773
- Yeah, hey, Anthony?

57:52.817 --> 57:54.340
- You know what, Bob, I'm sorry,

57:54.383 --> 57:57.212
I'm going by the more friendly
and less formal, Tony,

57:57.256 --> 57:59.388
these days, I know
it's been a minute.

57:59.432 --> 58:01.173
- Hey, Anthony,
I'm gonna need you

58:01.216 --> 58:02.217
to clear off this contract.

58:02.261 --> 58:03.610
- Oh, no can do, Bob.

58:03.654 --> 58:05.438
This contract is free fire,

58:05.482 --> 58:09.703
as there are competing parties
for on Theodore Murretto.

58:09.747 --> 58:10.965
Hey, Anthony.

58:11.009 --> 58:12.924
- You know, I'm not
responding to that name.

58:12.967 --> 58:14.578
- Anthony?

58:14.621 --> 58:15.927
- Yeah, I'm not responding
to that fucking name, Bob.

58:15.970 --> 58:16.841
You heard me!

58:16.884 --> 58:19.583
- Doesn't Joe Tatino in Chicago

58:19.626 --> 58:23.238
have a $65,000
sticker on your head?

58:23.282 --> 58:25.371
- He does indeed, Bob.

58:25.414 --> 58:27.634
And all he's gotten back are
the heads of the assholes

58:27.678 --> 58:29.331
he's sent to collect mine.

58:30.594 --> 58:32.552
- Clear off my
contract now, Anthony,

58:32.596 --> 58:33.988
or as God as my witness,

58:34.032 --> 58:36.861
I'm gonna cut off your
fucking head, put it in a bag

58:36.904 --> 58:40.560
and drive it to
Chicago, I shit you not!

58:40.604 --> 58:41.953
- Meow!

58:41.996 --> 58:44.042
Is that the gauntlet you've
thrown down there, Bob?

58:44.085 --> 58:46.174
Are we gonna duel to the death?

58:53.486 --> 58:55.575
Well if so,

58:55.619 --> 58:58.317
I've foreseen some
terrible things for you

58:59.448 --> 59:01.625
in the not too
distant future, Bob.

59:04.976 --> 59:06.151
I drew you a dick.

59:07.544 --> 59:08.849
It just got weird.

59:10.242 --> 59:11.635
Well, it's gonna get weirder.

59:15.639 --> 59:17.379
You like this action, Murretto?

59:19.164 --> 59:19.947
Murretto?

59:21.601 --> 59:24.473
I'm coming in there
whether you like it or not.

59:26.824 --> 59:28.477
- Now you see the difference?

59:29.609 --> 59:32.873
That is a psychopath.

59:43.667 --> 59:44.842
- 10-13.

59:44.885 --> 59:46.974
This is Officer Valerie Young.

59:48.541 --> 59:52.197
I am gravely wounded in the
subfloor detention block

59:52.240 --> 59:54.547
at the Gun Creek City
police headquarters.

59:54.591 --> 59:55.592
Copy.

59:56.680 --> 59:58.159
Can anyone hear me?

59:59.508 --> 1:00:00.292
10-13.

1:00:01.467 --> 1:00:04.557
Officer in dire
medical need, over.

1:00:13.522 --> 1:00:18.005
Fuck!

1:00:18.049 --> 1:00:20.181
- You're gonna run out
of time yet, Young.

1:00:21.269 --> 1:00:22.575
You're gonna die.

1:00:22.619 --> 1:00:24.664
- Teddy doesn't care
if you live or die.

1:00:24.708 --> 1:00:25.491
- Right, and you do.

1:00:25.534 --> 1:00:26.405
- Don't listen to him.

1:00:26.448 --> 1:00:27.319
- Trust me.

1:00:27.362 --> 1:00:28.537
I don't care what

1:00:28.581 --> 1:00:29.669
that fucking idiot says.
- Let me help you.

1:00:29.713 --> 1:00:30.452
- Don't fucking do it.
- Both of you,

1:00:30.496 --> 1:00:31.540
shut the fuck up!

1:00:33.630 --> 1:00:34.674
God, shut up.

1:00:35.719 --> 1:00:36.720
- Fuck.

1:00:41.768 --> 1:00:43.378
Valerie?

1:00:47.469 --> 1:00:48.209
Valerie?

1:00:50.821 --> 1:00:52.170
Are you there?

1:00:55.173 --> 1:00:56.478
It's Huber.

1:00:56.522 --> 1:00:57.610
- Huber, you've got an
armed man out there.

1:00:57.654 --> 1:00:58.655
Watch your back.

1:00:58.698 --> 1:00:59.960
I'm shot.

1:01:00.004 --> 1:01:01.658
Both detainees are secure.

1:01:03.529 --> 1:01:05.749
Suspect
fled the scene.

1:01:05.792 --> 1:01:07.272
It's over.

1:01:10.971 --> 1:01:12.712
Passcode isn't working.

1:01:12.756 --> 1:01:14.279
Did you change it?

1:01:14.322 --> 1:01:15.628
- Yeah.

1:01:15.672 --> 1:01:16.847
Well,
tell me what it is

1:01:16.890 --> 1:01:17.761
so I can get in
there and help you.

1:01:17.804 --> 1:01:18.849
- Where's Mitchell?

1:01:21.025 --> 1:01:22.591
They're
all dead, Valerie.

1:01:24.898 --> 1:01:25.682
I'm sorry.

1:01:27.335 --> 1:01:29.903
Son of a bitch murdered
every last man.

1:01:34.821 --> 1:01:35.866
Where are you shot?

1:01:37.737 --> 1:01:39.826
- Didn't you hear
my call out earlier?

1:01:42.350 --> 1:01:45.005
- No, I wasn't near my radio.

1:01:56.364 --> 1:01:57.061
Valerie!

1:01:58.758 --> 1:02:00.064
Huber.

1:02:03.197 --> 1:02:05.852
Why were you interested
in those IAFIS scans?

1:02:08.855 --> 1:02:10.683
What's that?

1:02:10.727 --> 1:02:15.296
- Kimble said you asked about
the IAFIS scans for our DUI.

1:02:18.169 --> 1:02:19.431
You know, I...

1:02:20.737 --> 1:02:22.739
I just had a really bad
feeling about that guy.

1:02:24.610 --> 1:02:26.003
- Which guy?

1:02:26.046 --> 1:02:27.178
Viddick.

1:02:27.221 --> 1:02:28.222
The DUI.

1:02:29.441 --> 1:02:31.269
- He was processed as John Doe.

1:02:32.836 --> 1:02:34.707
Where'd you get
the name Viddick?

1:02:39.712 --> 1:02:42.541
Where's the man who killed
your fellow officers, Huber?

1:02:44.761 --> 1:02:46.588
Is he whispering in your ear?

1:02:53.770 --> 1:02:55.554
He don't
care about us.

1:02:57.425 --> 1:03:01.865
All we have to do is stand
down and give him Murretto.

1:03:02.996 --> 1:03:04.824
We've already lost three cops.

1:03:04.868 --> 1:03:08.915
I can't even think about
losing another one, okay?

1:03:10.743 --> 1:03:13.528
- You're a piece of shit,
Huber, and a horrible cop.

1:03:14.834 --> 1:03:17.358
I never liked you and
Sarge couldn't stand you.

1:03:18.664 --> 1:03:20.753
- Well, you know what, Valerie?

1:03:20.797 --> 1:03:22.929
Sarge doesn't have to
worry about me anymore

1:03:22.973 --> 1:03:24.583
and you're not gonna
have to worry either,

1:03:24.626 --> 1:03:26.846
if you keep up this
Alamo bullshit!

1:03:28.239 --> 1:03:30.676
You already got a bullet
in your belly, hun.

1:03:30.719 --> 1:03:32.330
You want another
one in your brain?

1:03:32.373 --> 1:03:34.854
- I'd like you to
try, motherfucker.

1:03:34.898 --> 1:03:38.075
I'd like you to get on in here
and get that bullet there.

1:03:38.118 --> 1:03:39.554
You wanna do that for me?

1:03:39.598 --> 1:03:41.034
- Oh yeah, we are.

1:03:41.078 --> 1:03:43.732
We're gonna come in there,
you stupid fucking bitch!

1:03:43.776 --> 1:03:44.951
You hear me?

1:03:44.995 --> 1:03:46.823
We're getting in there!

1:04:05.537 --> 1:04:06.973
- And Teddy's dead.

1:04:12.587 --> 1:04:14.459
said he'd see him home

1:04:14.502 --> 1:04:16.809
and he should've known

1:04:24.773 --> 1:04:26.863
the wrong man

1:04:26.906 --> 1:04:31.868
but that's how it go

1:04:34.131 --> 1:04:36.568
a flunky while

1:04:48.101 --> 1:04:50.495
- Actually, he's got
a pretty nice voice.

1:04:59.939 --> 1:05:00.897
This is it.

1:05:02.420 --> 1:05:05.118
Can't we access
it through these ducts?

1:05:05.162 --> 1:05:06.467
It's 12
inches in diameter.

1:05:06.511 --> 1:05:08.252
It's way too narrow.

1:05:08.295 --> 1:05:10.254
How about
we break down that door?

1:05:11.255 --> 1:05:12.517
Nah.

1:05:12.560 --> 1:05:14.911
This thing's like the
side of a fucking tank.

1:05:14.954 --> 1:05:16.303
It's an armory style door.

1:05:16.347 --> 1:05:17.391
Never get in.

1:05:17.435 --> 1:05:19.002
That's why I think,

1:05:19.045 --> 1:05:20.829
we bust in through this wall.

1:05:20.873 --> 1:05:22.135
Come in through the locker room.

1:05:22.179 --> 1:05:23.920
This is Murretto's
cell, right here.

1:05:23.963 --> 1:05:26.009
I mean, it's a thick
son of a bitch.

1:05:26.052 --> 1:05:28.228
Probably a foot
of solid concrete.

1:05:34.582 --> 1:05:35.366
- Well,

1:05:37.890 --> 1:05:39.196
let's bang some rock.

1:05:50.772 --> 1:05:52.600
- What do you think
they're doing out there?

1:05:54.863 --> 1:05:56.082
- Finding a way in.

1:05:58.041 --> 1:05:58.955
When they do get in,

1:06:00.217 --> 1:06:02.523
they'll kill you first.

1:06:02.567 --> 1:06:04.090
I would tell you to
barter with them,

1:06:04.134 --> 1:06:07.441
but Lamb will just lie, then
strip the skin off your bones

1:06:07.485 --> 1:06:08.965
once you give him what he wants.

1:06:12.098 --> 1:06:13.230
All you had to do

1:06:13.273 --> 1:06:15.449
was just let me blow
Murretto's head off

1:06:15.493 --> 1:06:16.842
when I had the chance.

1:06:18.061 --> 1:06:19.584
Then you wouldn't
be sitting there

1:06:19.627 --> 1:06:22.108
with a bullet in your side,
praying for a fucking miracle.

1:06:25.024 --> 1:06:26.417
- Bullets before prayers.

1:06:31.117 --> 1:06:32.640
- Is that a poem?

1:06:33.990 --> 1:06:36.166
- Bullets before prayers.

1:06:38.081 --> 1:06:40.083
My great-grandfather
had that scrawled

1:06:40.126 --> 1:06:43.042
on his Stahlhelm
helmet in World War II.

1:06:45.044 --> 1:06:46.002
- Stahlhelm?

1:06:47.481 --> 1:06:50.049
Isn't that a German army helmet?

1:06:50.093 --> 1:06:52.399
- Your great-grandfather
was a Nazi?

1:06:54.314 --> 1:06:55.098
But you're...

1:06:56.099 --> 1:06:57.404
- Black?

1:06:57.448 --> 1:06:58.188
- Black.

1:06:59.580 --> 1:07:02.627
- Nazis were in North
Africa in the 1940s.

1:07:02.670 --> 1:07:06.326
Just a little trivia to
take from this circumstance.

1:07:08.111 --> 1:07:10.722
Like most Germans, at
the time he had to fight,

1:07:10.765 --> 1:07:13.812
they were being overrun,
he didn't have a choice.

1:07:13.855 --> 1:07:14.900
- Yeah, deja vu.

1:07:16.075 --> 1:07:17.250
- Wait, what?

1:07:17.294 --> 1:07:18.817
- Deja vu.

1:07:18.860 --> 1:07:20.297
- That's not deja vu, dummy.

1:07:20.340 --> 1:07:21.080
- Yes it is.

1:07:21.124 --> 1:07:22.081
- No, it's not.

1:07:22.125 --> 1:07:23.865
Deja vu is when you experience

1:07:23.909 --> 1:07:25.780
the exact same
thing a second time.

1:07:25.824 --> 1:07:28.044
- Or the sensation
that you have.

1:07:28.087 --> 1:07:29.610
- Why you taking his side?

1:07:29.654 --> 1:07:31.482
- How the fuck am
I taking his side?

1:07:31.525 --> 1:07:33.614
- You said that your
great-grandfather had a fight,

1:07:33.658 --> 1:07:36.922
that he was overrun
and he had no choice.

1:07:36.965 --> 1:07:39.055
Like me, sitting right here.

1:07:40.012 --> 1:07:41.057
Deja vu.

1:07:41.100 --> 1:07:42.754
- Okay, whatever.

1:07:42.797 --> 1:07:43.581
You win.

1:07:45.800 --> 1:07:47.628
Anybody else feel cold?

1:07:47.672 --> 1:07:49.108
- Hey, look at me!

1:07:49.152 --> 1:07:51.110
Young, don't close your eyes.

1:07:51.154 --> 1:07:52.024
Throw me the keys.

1:07:52.068 --> 1:07:53.591
Throw me the keys.

1:07:53.634 --> 1:07:54.679
- You're better off bleeding
to death, sitting there.

1:07:54.722 --> 1:07:55.984
Do not give him the keys!

1:07:56.028 --> 1:07:57.334
- You gonna listen to
that contract killer

1:07:57.377 --> 1:07:58.596
or are you gonna listen to me?

1:07:58.639 --> 1:07:59.640
- Are you fucking kidding?

1:07:59.684 --> 1:08:01.555
He's a mob flunky conman.

1:08:01.599 --> 1:08:02.861
Who would you
rather have fighting

1:08:02.904 --> 1:08:04.167
for your life right now, Val?

1:08:04.210 --> 1:08:05.037
- Not you.

1:08:07.039 --> 1:08:08.127
Never you.

1:08:08.171 --> 1:08:10.042
- Why, because I'm the bad guy?

1:08:12.479 --> 1:08:13.219
Shit.

1:08:19.095 --> 1:08:20.966
Here they come.

1:08:39.941 --> 1:08:40.899
- Hey, asshole!

1:08:42.248 --> 1:08:43.467
You gonna help me

1:08:43.510 --> 1:08:44.685
or you just gonna sit
there eating that shit?

1:08:44.729 --> 1:08:47.906
- We's got but the one
hammer there, hoss.

1:08:47.949 --> 1:08:49.342
- Yeah, I get that.

1:08:49.386 --> 1:08:52.171
But I thought that maybe
we could switch, you know?

1:08:52.215 --> 1:08:53.781
Trade off.

1:08:53.825 --> 1:08:56.523
- Oh, come on, man, I already
killed four people tonight.

1:08:56.567 --> 1:08:58.177
Including two of your coworkers.

1:08:58.221 --> 1:09:00.919
I am bushed.

1:09:05.358 --> 1:09:08.100
- I killed my fucking
sergeant tonight.

1:09:08.144 --> 1:09:09.580
And an innocent civilian.

1:09:10.972 --> 1:09:12.235
- Yeah, well.

1:09:19.024 --> 1:09:21.679
You in the cop business.

1:09:21.722 --> 1:09:23.942
So that makes you a murderer.

1:09:23.985 --> 1:09:25.117
But I'm in the murder business,

1:09:25.161 --> 1:09:27.424
so that just makes me a laborer.

1:09:27.467 --> 1:09:28.686
You see how that works?

1:09:29.513 --> 1:09:31.167
- You're fucking crazy.

1:09:31.210 --> 1:09:33.604
- And also, on top of it,
not to beat a dead horse,

1:09:33.647 --> 1:09:35.606
but you could use some
physical activity.

1:09:35.649 --> 1:09:36.955
- Oh, motherfucker.

1:09:36.998 --> 1:09:38.783
- Come on, man, I kinda
mean your wife likes you

1:09:38.826 --> 1:09:40.176
sliding all up on top of her,

1:09:40.219 --> 1:09:44.310
looking like a big old
Hot Pocket with a hard-on.

1:09:44.354 --> 1:09:47.095
I mean, look, don't you wanna
look like that one time?

1:09:47.139 --> 1:09:51.099
Fucking Chris Hemsworth
enjoys a beach day

1:09:51.143 --> 1:09:53.319
with his wife, Elsa Pataky.

1:09:54.886 --> 1:09:57.802
Just one time in your life,
don't you wanna look like Thor?

1:09:57.845 --> 1:09:59.238
Of course you do.

1:09:59.282 --> 1:10:01.588
It's only gonna
happen with hard work

1:10:01.632 --> 1:10:03.503
and a swinging of
the mighty hammer.

1:10:04.591 --> 1:10:06.202
So carry on, my Norseman.

1:10:07.377 --> 1:10:11.250
Come on, Thor!

1:10:11.294 --> 1:10:13.296
- I think we're out
of prayers, Young.

1:10:16.037 --> 1:10:17.256
I don't want to
see you bleed out

1:10:17.300 --> 1:10:18.518
and I don't want to see anybody

1:10:18.562 --> 1:10:21.129
take the skin off your bones.

1:10:22.696 --> 1:10:24.002
I just wanna get the
fuck out of here.

1:10:24.045 --> 1:10:25.482
- Young, you wanna see
your way through this?

1:10:25.525 --> 1:10:26.874
Don't listen to him.

1:10:26.918 --> 1:10:28.789
Throw me the fucking keys.

1:10:30.182 --> 1:10:31.575
Think he's gonna make
it through these guys,

1:10:31.618 --> 1:10:34.055
and if he does, you think
you're gonna see him again?

1:10:41.324 --> 1:10:43.021
Oh, you gotta be
fucking kidding me.

1:10:43.064 --> 1:10:44.936
All that blood loss has
made you loopy, lady.

1:10:44.979 --> 1:10:47.982
I don't wanna
die in here if I can help it.

1:10:48.026 --> 1:10:49.767
And I'm trusting you, Teddy.

1:10:51.334 --> 1:10:54.293
Do as you say and help
me and not run from this.

1:10:54.337 --> 1:10:56.600
- All Teddy does is run!

1:10:56.643 --> 1:10:58.384
He was running from
me, he ran to you.

1:10:58.428 --> 1:10:59.777
How do you think he got in here?

1:10:59.820 --> 1:11:02.214
He sucker punched a cop, you!

1:11:03.346 --> 1:11:05.130
- I got that last week.

1:11:05.173 --> 1:11:06.218
- Fuck.

1:11:06.262 --> 1:11:07.306
- I want it back.

1:11:07.350 --> 1:11:08.742
Oh, you
just fucked us both.

1:11:08.786 --> 1:11:12.616
- In the kitchen, next
to the intake lobby,

1:11:12.659 --> 1:11:15.314
there's a trauma kit
above the fridge.

1:11:15.358 --> 1:11:17.751
He's a fucking
opportunist, that's all he is.

1:11:17.795 --> 1:11:19.840
- Please bring that back here.

1:11:21.059 --> 1:11:23.627
I won't make it
otherwise, Teddy.

1:11:23.670 --> 1:11:26.282
- Ask Officer Young where your
ex wife and son are, Teddy.

1:11:36.248 --> 1:11:38.468
- You said you sent out
a unit to check on them.

1:11:40.252 --> 1:11:42.385
- Did that unit ever
arrive, Officer Young?

1:11:44.691 --> 1:11:47.303
Are Teddy's family all
wrapped away, safe and sound?

1:11:48.782 --> 1:11:49.522
- Young,

1:11:51.959 --> 1:11:52.656
where are they?

1:11:56.703 --> 1:11:57.748
- I'm sorry, Teddy.

1:11:58.923 --> 1:11:59.706
- What?

1:12:01.404 --> 1:12:02.405
- I'm sorry.

1:12:28.039 --> 1:12:31.782
- Did you know my family
was dead, Viddick?

1:12:31.825 --> 1:12:34.132
- You couldn't have
saved them anyway, Teddy.

1:12:36.177 --> 1:12:37.788
You doomed them a long time ago.

1:12:42.314 --> 1:12:43.924
- Did you kill my family, Bob?

1:12:50.453 --> 1:12:51.323
- I didn't.

1:12:56.676 --> 1:12:59.418
- Lamb have something
to do it with it?

1:13:01.333 --> 1:13:02.334
I can't be sure.

1:13:02.378 --> 1:13:03.161
- Best guess.

1:13:04.162 --> 1:13:05.511
Where were they found?

1:13:06.904 --> 1:13:09.863
- In a runoff slew
near Lake Mead.

1:13:15.478 --> 1:13:17.218
- Yeah, it was him.

1:14:00.566 --> 1:14:02.046
On top of the car
there was a butt naked tranny

1:14:02.089 --> 1:14:02.960
with a mask on.

1:14:03.003 --> 1:14:04.657
- Dude, you can't say tranny.

1:14:04.701 --> 1:14:06.746
You have to say transvestite.

1:14:06.790 --> 1:14:08.095
- That's what you call them?

1:14:08.139 --> 1:14:09.401
- Now you have to
say transvestite.

1:14:09.445 --> 1:14:10.446
It's just like--
- Hey, fuck that.

1:14:10.489 --> 1:14:11.969
Hey, where the
fuck is everybody?

1:14:14.014 --> 1:14:16.016
They still doing
construction this late?

1:14:16.060 --> 1:14:17.104
- They shouldn't be.

1:14:33.817 --> 1:14:35.427
What the fuck is this?

1:14:36.515 --> 1:14:38.865
- What the fuck happened here?

1:14:54.968 --> 1:14:58.406
- Come on, man.

1:14:59.712 --> 1:15:01.584
- This fucking thing's
taking forever.

1:15:08.155 --> 1:15:10.462
- Huber, what the fuck?

1:15:10.506 --> 1:15:11.768
- Hey, guys.

1:15:11.811 --> 1:15:12.551
You're back.

1:15:12.595 --> 1:15:13.726
Where, why are you back?

1:15:13.770 --> 1:15:15.598
- We ran out to a scene for Val.

1:15:15.641 --> 1:15:17.425
- What the fuck are you doing?

1:15:17.469 --> 1:15:18.209
And who is this?

1:15:18.252 --> 1:15:18.992
Why is he--

1:15:23.431 --> 1:15:24.432
- No, no, no, wait, hold on.

1:15:24.476 --> 1:15:25.956
- No, no, Huber.

1:15:25.999 --> 1:15:27.827
Huber, I don't know nothing,
I didn't see nothing.

1:15:27.871 --> 1:15:29.220
Hey man, I got kids.

1:15:29.263 --> 1:15:30.569
- He's not gonna say anything.

1:15:30.613 --> 1:15:31.918
Tell him you're not
gonna say anything.

1:15:31.962 --> 1:15:33.746
- I swear to fucking
Christ, I'm not gonna say--

1:15:33.790 --> 1:15:35.226
- Are you sure?

1:15:35.269 --> 1:15:37.445
- You can trust
him, he's my friend.

1:15:37.489 --> 1:15:38.272
- Oh, you all friends.

1:15:38.316 --> 1:15:39.535
- Yeah.

1:15:39.578 --> 1:15:40.274
- Then you shoot him.

1:15:40.318 --> 1:15:41.014
All friendly like.

1:15:41.058 --> 1:15:41.798
- What?

1:15:41.841 --> 1:15:43.190
- I can't, not Barnes.

1:15:43.234 --> 1:15:44.583
- You shot your sergeant.

1:15:44.627 --> 1:15:45.715
- This man means
something to me.

1:15:45.758 --> 1:15:46.890
- I'm gonna walk over there

1:15:46.933 --> 1:15:48.587
and empty the contents
of this weapon

1:15:48.631 --> 1:15:50.241
into his face.
- No, oh God.

1:15:50.284 --> 1:15:52.417
- So if you plan
to be more humane,

1:15:52.460 --> 1:15:53.679
now is the fucking time!

1:15:54.593 --> 1:15:56.421
- No, Huber, Huber,
come on, man.

1:15:57.596 --> 1:15:59.032
He shot Ruby.

1:16:00.077 --> 1:16:01.644
I'm sorry, Barnes.

1:16:01.687 --> 1:16:02.862
- Look at me, dude.

1:16:02.906 --> 1:16:04.124
Look at me.
- You were right.

1:16:04.168 --> 1:16:05.604
- Look at me.

1:16:05.648 --> 1:16:06.474
- You know my kids, man, I
promised them I'd be home.

1:16:06.518 --> 1:16:07.606
I know, just a second.

1:16:07.650 --> 1:16:08.738
Just close your eyes, all right?

1:16:36.113 --> 1:16:38.071
Please tell me
your grand plan was not

1:16:38.115 --> 1:16:41.074
freeing that fucking idiot
and putting a gun in his hand.

1:16:44.034 --> 1:16:45.949
- What choice did I have?

1:16:47.690 --> 1:16:49.300
Freeing and arming me.

1:16:52.433 --> 1:16:53.913
- You're a hired killer.

1:16:59.702 --> 1:17:03.314
- I wish you knew
what I knew about him.

1:17:03.357 --> 1:17:06.839
And you were so hellbent
on saving the day

1:17:06.883 --> 1:17:08.536
that you wound up
shooting yourself.

1:17:08.580 --> 1:17:09.668
- I don't wanna live in a world

1:17:09.712 --> 1:17:11.539
where people like
you win, Viddick.

1:17:11.583 --> 1:17:12.671
- Right.

1:17:14.194 --> 1:17:16.109
You'll just safeguard
a lying asshole

1:17:16.153 --> 1:17:18.198
and give your life
to protect his.

1:17:19.286 --> 1:17:20.636
- Should I live like you, Bob?

1:17:22.942 --> 1:17:24.727
- It's honest.

1:17:24.770 --> 1:17:25.597
- It's lawless.

1:17:26.990 --> 1:17:28.687
And I won't stand for it.

1:17:28.731 --> 1:17:32.560
- No, you'll just sit there
and bleed out instead.

1:17:36.216 --> 1:17:37.000
Come on.

1:17:38.392 --> 1:17:39.219
Give me the keys.

1:17:40.960 --> 1:17:42.658
Give me the keys, Valerie.

1:17:45.312 --> 1:17:46.096
- No.

1:17:47.271 --> 1:17:50.622
And don't call me
Valerie, it's creepy.

1:17:57.063 --> 1:17:58.238
What the fuck?

1:17:59.196 --> 1:18:01.154
How'd you do that, Bob?

1:18:01.198 --> 1:18:03.243
- Let's put a pin in
that right now, Val.

1:18:04.984 --> 1:18:06.159
I just wanted to see how

1:18:06.203 --> 1:18:07.683
our little friendship
would play out.

1:18:09.989 --> 1:18:12.470
Now pretty soon you're
gonna lose consciousness.

1:18:12.513 --> 1:18:15.125
You're gonna fall asleep and
you're not gonna wake up.

1:18:17.475 --> 1:18:21.522
- Then will you listen to
my dying wish before I do?

1:18:32.708 --> 1:18:33.926
- You have someone you love.

1:18:35.754 --> 1:18:36.712
- Don't we all?

1:18:36.755 --> 1:18:38.714
- No, we don't but you do.

1:18:42.108 --> 1:18:44.676
No, that's your left
hand, your gun hand.

1:18:44.720 --> 1:18:45.982
Not gonna wear a ring there.

1:18:49.637 --> 1:18:50.421
You're married.

1:18:53.467 --> 1:18:54.730
You wanna see him again?

1:18:57.254 --> 1:18:59.865
Teddy's not coming back,
you can trust me on that.

1:19:01.040 --> 1:19:03.390
You said you wanted
to take your chances.

1:19:03.434 --> 1:19:04.827
Here they are.

1:19:04.870 --> 1:19:06.742
You either sit
there and bleed out

1:19:08.831 --> 1:19:10.397
or give me the goddamn keys.

1:19:44.910 --> 1:19:46.564
Teddy!

1:19:48.435 --> 1:19:49.219
You shot me!

1:20:01.884 --> 1:20:06.062
Teddy, you could've stopped
this whole goddamn mess, man,

1:20:06.105 --> 1:20:08.368
and saved your family too.

1:20:08.412 --> 1:20:11.371
Because all they
wanted was those names.

1:20:11.415 --> 1:20:14.113
Well, and all the
money you stole.

1:20:14.157 --> 1:20:16.594
You thieving little
motherfucker.

1:20:41.662 --> 1:20:42.750
Oh!

1:20:42.794 --> 1:20:45.841
You're shooting at
shadows, Mr. Teddy.

1:20:45.884 --> 1:20:47.886
Yeah, you better
conserve that ammo.

1:20:59.158 --> 1:21:01.508
need gunfire

1:21:16.045 --> 1:21:17.394
What?

1:21:19.439 --> 1:21:21.267
- Officer Huber.

1:21:21.311 --> 1:21:22.486
- Listen, I...

1:21:40.504 --> 1:21:41.984
Oh, no, no.

1:21:48.033 --> 1:21:51.907
No!

1:21:51.950 --> 1:21:52.951
Oh!

1:21:52.995 --> 1:21:54.300
No!

1:22:08.271 --> 1:22:10.273
- I sedated them, Teddy.

1:22:12.840 --> 1:22:15.060
They were sound asleep when
I put the Ziplocs over them.

1:22:15.104 --> 1:22:16.409
It didn't take but two minutes.

1:22:16.453 --> 1:22:18.020
I didn't want them to suffer.

1:22:21.153 --> 1:22:22.894
I didn't fuck up, Teddy.

1:22:22.938 --> 1:22:23.982
You did.

1:22:26.463 --> 1:22:28.856
You the fuck up of the family.

1:22:30.162 --> 1:22:33.252
And then I laid
them in the water.

1:22:33.296 --> 1:22:35.646
We all deserve the
water in the end,

1:22:35.689 --> 1:22:37.604
no matter what we done.

1:23:35.271 --> 1:23:37.012
You're fucking Huber.

1:23:38.578 --> 1:23:39.318
What?

1:23:58.990 --> 1:23:59.991
No.

1:24:00.035 --> 1:24:00.818
No.

1:24:02.994 --> 1:24:05.083
Do it!

1:24:09.914 --> 1:24:10.697
- Anthony.

1:24:16.877 --> 1:24:17.791
- Oh.

1:24:36.288 --> 1:24:38.508
- All right, now it hurts.

1:24:45.254 --> 1:24:46.516
Think I'm gonna need something

1:24:46.559 --> 1:24:48.170
just a little bit
bigger, Anthony,

1:24:48.213 --> 1:24:50.128
to cut off your head.

1:24:53.827 --> 1:24:56.178
That's the reaction.

1:24:56.221 --> 1:24:57.004
- Fuck.

1:24:58.310 --> 1:24:59.398
Fuck!

1:24:59.442 --> 1:25:02.532
Fuck you!

1:25:11.018 --> 1:25:11.802
- Parlay.

1:25:13.499 --> 1:25:14.283
- What?

1:25:16.154 --> 1:25:16.937
- Pirate code

1:25:18.200 --> 1:25:21.116
A temporary ceasefire
to achieve a common end.

1:25:22.421 --> 1:25:24.075
As in, this ends.

1:25:26.686 --> 1:25:29.124
Our little lost Lamb
isn't dead just yet.

1:25:31.213 --> 1:25:33.128
So I'm gonna let
you send him off.

1:25:36.218 --> 1:25:37.393
Revenge for your family.

1:25:39.612 --> 1:25:41.223
And then you and I
are going to resume--

1:25:44.443 --> 1:25:45.227
- Oh, man!

1:25:47.142 --> 1:25:48.491
This motherfucker.

1:25:50.536 --> 1:25:51.407
That hurts.

1:25:53.060 --> 1:25:54.236
Hey,

1:25:54.279 --> 1:25:55.106
Teddy.

1:26:00.416 --> 1:26:01.634
The water.

1:26:04.115 --> 1:26:04.855
The water.

1:28:07.369 --> 1:28:08.500
- Not bad, is it?

1:28:12.417 --> 1:28:13.549
That's jackfruit.

1:28:15.115 --> 1:28:16.247
It's not chicken.

1:28:18.467 --> 1:28:22.949
I mix some garlic and cilantro
with store-bought coleslaw.

1:28:25.430 --> 1:28:26.518
That's the secret.

1:28:26.562 --> 1:28:27.345
- Val.

1:28:27.389 --> 1:28:28.390
- Teddy.

1:28:29.565 --> 1:28:31.436
You never came back.

1:28:31.480 --> 1:28:33.090
- I was coming back, Val.

1:28:33.133 --> 1:28:36.615
I was grabbing this kit, right
here, and I was coming back.

1:28:36.659 --> 1:28:41.664
- Oh, so you were gonna
bring it after you ate,

1:28:42.882 --> 1:28:44.406
but before you lit
this place on fire?

1:28:46.712 --> 1:28:47.626
And where's my gun?

1:28:49.411 --> 1:28:50.542
Am I gonna get that back?

1:28:56.461 --> 1:28:57.332
That's okay.

1:28:59.508 --> 1:29:00.857
I got my friend's gun.

1:29:05.035 --> 1:29:06.253
My dead friend.

1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:15.350
I heard that
machine gun of yours

1:29:15.393 --> 1:29:16.525
making quite the statement.

1:29:19.005 --> 1:29:21.007
So, have you seen Huber?

1:29:24.184 --> 1:29:24.968
Lamb?

1:29:27.318 --> 1:29:28.363
Viddick?

1:29:38.155 --> 1:29:39.156
There it is.

1:29:41.463 --> 1:29:45.380
My own bullet that I put in
my stomach protecting you.

1:29:49.384 --> 1:29:51.777
Viddick was right about you.

1:29:54.345 --> 1:29:55.390
But...

1:29:57.392 --> 1:29:59.045
we are what we are.

1:30:00.395 --> 1:30:01.396
Always.

1:30:05.922 --> 1:30:07.445
You seem to always
have so much to say.

1:30:07.489 --> 1:30:08.577
Nothing new now?

1:30:11.449 --> 1:30:13.495
- I'm just wondering
where all this is going.

1:30:15.410 --> 1:30:16.411
- Yeah.

1:30:17.629 --> 1:30:18.413
Me too.

1:30:20.763 --> 1:30:22.417
I guess we'll find out soon.

1:30:23.722 --> 1:30:27.944
I radioed in a code three,
also known as a hot call, so,

1:30:27.987 --> 1:30:29.685
we're 10 minutes away
from our parking lot

1:30:29.728 --> 1:30:32.949
being flooded with
every available law
enforcement officer

1:30:32.992 --> 1:30:34.994
within a 20 mile radius.

1:30:38.084 --> 1:30:39.695
And I just took an
adrenaline shot.

1:30:41.740 --> 1:30:43.742
So I'm feeling a
little rambunctious.

1:30:47.311 --> 1:30:48.530
Shame.

1:30:52.142 --> 1:30:52.969
You could run.

1:30:54.797 --> 1:30:57.495
- So you could shoot
me in the back?

1:30:57.539 --> 1:30:59.192
- You've already
stabbed me in mind.

1:31:08.027 --> 1:31:10.682
I think we should get you
back to your cell now, Teddy.

1:31:25.654 --> 1:31:28.091
Unless you had
something else in mind.

1:32:42.600 --> 1:32:44.559
Thank you, Sarge.

1:34:34.451 --> 1:34:35.539
Thanks, Pena.

1:34:56.778 --> 1:34:58.954
Never more than a day
ahead of the devil, Teddy.

1:35:01.086 --> 1:35:02.784
Or maybe I'm your devil now.

1:35:04.220 --> 1:35:05.482
And this is our day.

1:35:07.745 --> 1:35:09.878
Can't run from this.

1:35:09.921 --> 1:35:11.444
Hell's already here.

1:36:31.742 --> 1:36:33.309
- You know, Val,

1:36:33.352 --> 1:36:36.007
I'm just sitting here wondering

1:36:36.051 --> 1:36:38.053
where things went
wrong between us.

1:36:39.837 --> 1:36:41.665
We were off to
such a good start.

1:36:41.708 --> 1:36:42.884
Val, Val, Val, wait, wait, wait!

1:36:42.927 --> 1:36:44.015
Give me 10 seconds.

1:36:44.059 --> 1:36:45.582
Give me 10 seconds of your time.

1:36:45.625 --> 1:36:46.583
Just give me 10 seconds!

1:37:15.177 --> 1:37:16.831
- I'm sorry, officer.

1:37:52.867 --> 1:37:53.868
- Oh.

1:37:56.392 --> 1:37:57.959
Good for you.

1:37:58.002 --> 1:38:00.787
You beat me, Bob.

1:38:25.247 --> 1:38:27.336
- What's in the bag, Bob?

1:38:30.730 --> 1:38:31.993
- Go home, Val.

1:38:34.865 --> 1:38:35.822
- She with you?

1:38:36.998 --> 1:38:37.824
Shier?

1:38:39.652 --> 1:38:41.045
- What does it matter?

1:38:41.089 --> 1:38:42.090
You made it.

1:38:47.704 --> 1:38:48.923
Let this go, Val.

1:38:54.058 --> 1:38:55.973
Just let it go.

1:39:07.942 --> 1:39:09.030
Yeah,

1:39:09.073 --> 1:39:09.944
there you go.

1:39:23.914 --> 1:39:24.697
Come on.

1:39:34.272 --> 1:39:35.056
Valerie?

1:39:39.277 --> 1:39:40.061
Forget it.

1:40:36.117 --> 1:40:37.727
Hey, it's Viddick.

1:40:39.033 --> 1:40:40.730
All good.

1:40:40.773 --> 1:40:41.818
Murretto's burned.

1:40:44.168 --> 1:40:45.691
Yeah, shit.

1:40:45.735 --> 1:40:47.737
Easy breezy.

1:40:47.780 --> 1:40:49.086
Oh, by the way,

1:40:49.130 --> 1:40:52.089
You wanna call that
Joe Tatino in Chicago?

1:40:52.133 --> 1:40:55.005
Tell him I'm bringing him
a beautiful piece of lamb.

1:40:56.572 --> 1:40:57.834
All units be advised.

1:40:57.877 --> 1:40:59.140
We have an unidentified

1:40:59.183 --> 1:41:00.097
white male suspect

1:41:00.141 --> 1:41:01.403
in a stolen police cruiser.

1:41:01.446 --> 1:41:03.057
Last seen exiting--

1:41:03.100 --> 1:41:04.188
- What was that, officer?
- Gun Creek police station.

1:41:04.232 --> 1:41:06.538
Heading southbound on I-15.

1:41:09.454 --> 1:41:14.459
- I'm gonna need you to pull
this fucking ambulance over.

1:41:15.199 --> 1:41:16.113
Right now.

1:41:27.429 --> 1:41:28.734
All units be advised.

1:41:28.778 --> 1:41:30.214
We're BOLO, BOLO on
a white male suspect

1:41:30.258 --> 1:41:32.782
identified as Robert K. Viddick.

1:41:32.825 --> 1:41:35.132
Robert K. Viddick
last seen exiting

1:41:35.176 --> 1:41:36.699
the Gun Creek police station.

1:41:36.742 --> 1:41:39.484
He's in possession of a
stolen, unmarked police car.

1:41:39.528 --> 1:41:40.529
- Text babe.

1:41:42.096 --> 1:41:45.229
Hey, baby, I'm putting in
a couple hours overtime.

1:41:45.273 --> 1:41:47.101
See you later, love you.

1:42:23.398 --> 1:42:24.616
- Oh, deja vu.

1:42:25.661 --> 1:42:26.749
- Deja vu.

1:42:35.018 --> 1:42:37.368
said he'd see him home

1:42:37.412 --> 1:42:42.199
and he should've known

1:42:50.251 --> 1:42:54.429
his woman and things

1:43:14.013 --> 1:43:18.017
that's how it goes

1:43:20.498 --> 1:43:23.632
a junkie, wow
