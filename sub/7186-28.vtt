00:09.610 --> 00:11.110

00:11.112 --> 00:13.545
- Yo-ho!

00:13.547 --> 00:15.647

<i>We need some volunteers ¶</i>

00:34.335 --> 00:36.068

00:53.721 --> 00:56.121
<i>¶ We'll set the course</i>

00:56.123 --> 00:58.390
<i>¶ And join the crew </i>

00:58.392 --> 01:00.459
<i>Yo-ho, let's go!</i>

01:02.762 --> 01:04.530
Ahoy, mateys!

01:04.532 --> 01:07.232
Do you want to join
my pirate crew?

01:08.668 --> 01:09.668
Great!

01:09.670 --> 01:11.336
To start today's adventure,

01:11.338 --> 01:14.073
everybody say
the Pirate Password:

01:14.075 --> 01:16.108
Yo-ho ho!

01:16.110 --> 01:19.411
- [all] Yo-ho ho!
- One more time!

01:19.413 --> 01:21.580
Yo-ho ho!

01:24.717 --> 01:27.820
[Jake] "Hook's Playful Plant!"

01:27.822 --> 01:31.290
[Smee sniffs] Sharky? Bones?

01:31.292 --> 01:33.325
[both] Aye-aye, Mr. Smee...?

01:33.327 --> 01:35.727
What is that delightful aroma?

01:35.729 --> 01:38.797
Did-did one of you lads
take a bath?

01:38.799 --> 01:41.133
A bath? Ha! Never!

01:41.135 --> 01:45.237
It would take twenty baths
to make me that sweet-smelly!
[chuckle]

01:45.239 --> 01:48.740
- Whatever could it be?
- [Hook] 'Tis I, Mr. Smee!

01:48.742 --> 01:50.709
Or rather, me cologne.

01:50.711 --> 01:54.279
Red Jessica gave it to me!

01:54.281 --> 01:57.282
She's visiting today and
I want to smell me best!

01:58.418 --> 02:01.720
Ah yes, <i>Eau de Rose.</i>

02:01.722 --> 02:05.524
She should be able to smell
you from a mile away, Cap'n.

02:05.526 --> 02:09.128
Excellent!
Now get to work, ye swabs!

02:09.130 --> 02:12.498
I want me ship ship-shape
for Red Jessica!

02:12.500 --> 02:15.801
But... isn't our boat always
in the shape of a ship?

02:15.803 --> 02:20.839
No, you ninny, I want the deck
swabbed, sails mended, cannons
polished!

02:20.841 --> 02:24.843
And this withered
little plant is pathetic.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.812
You know how Red Jessica
loves plants.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.580
I want it spruced up!

02:28.582 --> 02:30.449
- [Bones] Aye-aye!
- [Sharky] At your service,
Cap'n.

02:31.451 --> 02:33.485
What in Never Land?

02:33.487 --> 02:37.356
The plant seems to very much
like that cologne of yours, sir!

02:37.358 --> 02:39.892
Then more it shall have!

02:42.195 --> 02:45.164
[chuckle] It's grown a
wee little flower!

02:45.166 --> 02:48.267
Splendid! Red Jessica
loves flowers!

02:48.269 --> 02:52.204
Oh, this will really impress me
swashbucklin' sweetie!

02:52.206 --> 02:54.673
[Smee] Erm, Cap'n, sir?

02:54.675 --> 02:58.510
Oh, what is it now,
Smee... eeee!

02:58.512 --> 03:02.848
- Oh stop clowning about!
- [stammers] Not clowning, sir!

03:02.850 --> 03:07.186
The plant seems to be giving
me a big, cuddly hug!

03:07.188 --> 03:09.922
- [kissing sound]
- Methinks it likes me, sir!

03:09.924 --> 03:13.525
[kissing sound]

03:13.527 --> 03:17.796
[gasps]
Methinks it likes me, too!

03:17.798 --> 03:22.768
[Hook] Great green invasion,
Smee, it likes me ship, as well!

03:22.770 --> 03:24.503
[Bones] It likes everything!

03:26.339 --> 03:29.474
[Jake] Yo-ho, Skully!
Anything to report?

03:29.476 --> 03:31.610
[Skully] Now that you
mention it... yeah!

03:31.612 --> 03:33.712
There's something on the
horizon...

03:33.714 --> 03:37.449
...it looks like some
kinda giant tree.

03:37.451 --> 03:39.251
That's not a big deal, is it?

03:39.253 --> 03:42.421
I mean, there's lots of trees
on islands around here.

03:42.423 --> 03:46.558
Except, according to my map...
there is no island over there!

03:46.560 --> 03:48.427
[Jake] Well, there sure is now!

03:48.429 --> 03:52.464
Come on, mateys, let's go check
out this strange new island!

03:52.466 --> 03:54.700
Keep a lookout for
Gold Doubloons.

03:54.702 --> 03:57.970
Whenever we solve a Pirate
Problem together, they'll
appear.

03:57.972 --> 04:01.273
Then we'll collect 'em and put
'em in our Team Treasure Chest.

04:01.275 --> 04:02.874
Is everybody ready?

04:02.876 --> 04:05.844
- I got my sword!
- I got my map!

04:05.846 --> 04:08.380
And I've got my Pixie Dust!

04:08.382 --> 04:11.750
The fairies gave it to me
so that we can use it to fly!

04:11.752 --> 04:13.852
But only in emergencies!

04:13.854 --> 04:15.387
[rings]

04:15.389 --> 04:18.790
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys, away! </i>

04:18.792 --> 04:22.728
<i>- ¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>
<i>- Let's go!</i>

04:22.730 --> 04:25.864
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

04:25.866 --> 04:28.934
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

04:28.936 --> 04:31.503
<i>¶ And me </i>

04:33.006 --> 04:36.742
[all] Whoa... it is an island!

04:36.744 --> 04:41.346
The whole thing looks
like a big huge plant to me!

04:41.348 --> 04:43.048
[Hook] Help!

04:43.050 --> 04:45.817
Crackers!
It's a talkin' plant!

04:45.819 --> 04:49.321
- [Hook] Help I say!
- [all] Captain Hook?

04:49.323 --> 04:53.792
The one and only, and in
need of immediate help!

04:53.794 --> 04:55.927
How'd your ship get
way up there?

04:55.929 --> 04:58.463
It's this blasted plant!

04:58.465 --> 05:01.933
'Tis growing too fast
and furious!

05:01.935 --> 05:03.402
[trilling "hello" sounds]

05:03.404 --> 05:04.936
It seems nice!

05:04.938 --> 05:07.072
A tad too nice!

05:07.074 --> 05:11.877
It's hugging me and me crew
so tight we can't untangle me
ship!

05:11.879 --> 05:13.879
We've got to help 'em, mateys!

05:13.881 --> 05:16.581
But... how do we get up there?

05:16.583 --> 05:20.852
I know. The plant stems have
grown together to form this
tree,

05:20.854 --> 05:23.755
but there are spaces
between the stems!

05:23.757 --> 05:27.693
We can stick these wooden pins
between the stems to make a
ladder!

05:27.695 --> 05:30.962
Jake, you are one
bright buccaneer!

05:37.637 --> 05:40.539
Al... most... there.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.874
It's working!
We're climbing up the plant...

05:42.876 --> 05:45.444
...and we got three
Gold Doubloons!

05:45.446 --> 05:46.945
[Jake] Let's grab 'em and go!

05:46.947 --> 05:50.882
Heads up, me hearties! Plant ho!

05:50.884 --> 05:52.417
[all giggling]

05:52.419 --> 05:55.420
It's... [giggles] tickle-y!

05:55.422 --> 05:58.590
- [all] Whoa!
- Where's it takin' ya!?

05:58.592 --> 06:00.092
It's the popinjays!

06:00.094 --> 06:02.794
Oh dear me! It's got them all!

06:02.796 --> 06:06.698
[giggles] I think it
likes us, too!

06:06.700 --> 06:10.769
But we need to help Captain
Hook way down there!

06:10.771 --> 06:14.606
These vines! We can
slide down 'em like ropes!

06:14.608 --> 06:16.441
Yo-ho, down we go!

06:16.443 --> 06:18.410
Right behind ya, Jake!

06:18.412 --> 06:20.779
Here I come, mateys!

06:22.815 --> 06:25.751
[groans] We made it
to Captain Hook's ship!

06:25.753 --> 06:27.919
And we got three more
Gold Doubloons!

06:27.921 --> 06:30.689
Let's grab 'em and go help Hook!

06:31.524 --> 06:33.792
Save me, popinjays!

06:33.794 --> 06:38.029
Oh, thank our lucky starfish!
You're here!

06:38.031 --> 06:41.867
[sniffs] Don't it smell
lover-ly!?

06:41.869 --> 06:43.468
Heads up, me hearties!

06:43.903 --> 06:46.405
[sniffing]

06:46.407 --> 06:47.906
That was close!

06:47.908 --> 06:51.610
That plant will definitely hug
us if we try to free Hook!

06:51.612 --> 06:55.480
Not if we hide inside these
barrels and scoot along.

06:55.482 --> 06:59.718
If the plant hugs the barrels,
we can just slip out the bottom!

06:59.720 --> 07:02.988
- [Jake] Perfect
pirate plan, Iz'!
- [Izzy] Thanks, Jake.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.656
[plant coos]

07:04.658 --> 07:07.159
Ah, coconuts!
It's got us!

07:07.161 --> 07:09.828
Now, who's going to free us?

07:09.830 --> 07:14.099
Crackers, look!
Red Jessica's on her way!

07:14.101 --> 07:19.905
[sighs] All I wanted was to
welcome me sweetheart
onto me ship-shape ship,

07:19.907 --> 07:23.775
not get me self wrapped up
in some blasted vine!

07:24.110 --> 07:26.611
Worst date ever!

07:26.613 --> 07:28.180
You can say that again.

07:28.182 --> 07:32.884
Ahoy, mateys!
Got a little problem?

07:32.886 --> 07:34.152
We sure do!

07:34.154 --> 07:36.855
Captain Hook's plant is
growing wild!

07:36.857 --> 07:38.790
How ever did that happen?

07:38.792 --> 07:41.626
We might have accidentally
sprayed the plant

07:41.628 --> 07:44.029
with some of the cologne
you gave the Cap'n!

07:44.031 --> 07:45.997
Oh, so that's it!

07:45.999 --> 07:50.802
<i>Eau de Rose</i> is powerful stuff,
a little goes a long way!

07:50.804 --> 07:54.105
Seems your plant had an
extreme reaction to it.

07:54.107 --> 07:57.676
Extreme? What makes you
say that? Whoa!

07:57.678 --> 07:58.777
That was close!

07:58.779 --> 08:00.579
I'm on me way!

08:00.581 --> 08:03.915
Just need to figure out how
to get up to the flowers...

08:03.917 --> 08:06.017
Too bad you can't fly!

08:06.019 --> 08:10.489
Oh, yes she can!
Pixie Dust... away!

08:14.727 --> 08:19.130
Rustlin' rose bushes!
I be flyin'!

08:19.132 --> 08:20.765
Ahoy, mateys!

08:20.767 --> 08:25.770
Oh, the excruciating
embarrassment...

08:25.772 --> 08:28.073
[chuckles] Silly James,

08:28.075 --> 08:31.710
you should never spray
<i>Eau de Rose</i> on any plant,

08:31.712 --> 08:33.612
it's much too powerful.

08:33.614 --> 08:35.113
What can we do about it?

08:35.115 --> 08:38.850
Yeah, this huggy plant
really likes to hug!

08:38.852 --> 08:42.053
Well, it's clear that this plant
loves you all,

08:42.055 --> 08:45.790
and it just needs to know
that you love it back.

08:45.792 --> 08:47.893
But... how can we tell it that?

08:47.895 --> 08:50.996
We just need to sing it
a love song!

08:50.998 --> 08:54.132
- [all] A love song?
- [plant coos]

08:54.134 --> 08:57.969
Sharky! Bones!
Give me a stormy C!

09:00.706 --> 09:03.608
<i>¶ You're such a sweet pea</i>
<i>buttercup ¶</i>

09:03.610 --> 09:05.777
<i>¶ Huggy love of mine </i>

09:05.779 --> 09:09.714
<i>¶ You can cover up with me</i>
<i>anytime ¶</i>

09:09.716 --> 09:13.885
<i>¶ I've watched you grow and</i>
<i>grow and grow ¶</i>

09:13.887 --> 09:18.223
<i>¶ And I want you to know </i>

09:18.225 --> 09:21.860
<i>¶ Huggy love</i>
<i>Huggy love o' mine ¶</i>

09:21.862 --> 09:26.331
<i>¶ You be precious</i>
<i>as a Gold Doubloon ¶</i>

09:26.333 --> 09:30.268
<i>¶ Huggy love</i>
<i>Huggy love o' mine ¶</i>

09:30.270 --> 09:34.139
<i>¶ I huggy love to</i>
<i>love you too ¶</i>

09:35.841 --> 09:37.609
[swooning sounds]

09:38.177 --> 09:40.045
Yay-hey, yes way!

09:44.317 --> 09:47.886
Mateys, it worked!
We're all free!

09:47.888 --> 09:50.722
And we got three more
Gold Doubloons!

09:50.724 --> 09:54.025
- Let's grab 'em and...
- Hang on, mateys!

09:54.027 --> 09:55.894
[Jake] The plant is shrinking!

09:55.896 --> 09:58.063
Goin' down!

10:03.769 --> 10:06.104
Yo-ho, way to go, Red Jessica!

10:06.106 --> 10:11.610
And now, to send the vile thing
to the bottom of the Never See!

10:11.612 --> 10:15.947
Oh James, please don't!
It's such a wonderful specimen.

10:15.949 --> 10:21.853
[clears throat] Remember, Cap'n,
you were saying just before
our little adventure

10:21.855 --> 10:26.891
that you planned to give
Red Jessica that plant as a
gift?

10:26.893 --> 10:29.094
[gasps] You were?

10:29.096 --> 10:32.230
I mean... yes, of course!

10:32.232 --> 10:38.003
Please, consider the Hugging
Love Plant my gift to you.

10:38.005 --> 10:43.308
Oh, James, thank you so much!

10:43.310 --> 10:48.213
I... I... aye-aye-aye...
Oh!

10:48.215 --> 10:50.415
Good catch, mateys!

10:52.385 --> 10:56.154
Thanks, mateys, for helping us
save Hook and his crew from the
Hugging Love Plant!

10:56.156 --> 11:00.425
Now let's put all our Gold
Doubloons into our Team Treasure
Chest!

11:07.967 --> 11:10.135
<i>¶ Weigh-hey,</i>
<i>well done, crew ¶</i>

11:10.137 --> 11:12.003
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

11:12.005 --> 11:14.172
<i>¶ Weigh-hey,</i>
<i>with help from you ¶</i>

11:14.174 --> 11:17.108
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons ¶</i>

11:17.110 --> 11:19.144
C'mon, count with us!

11:20.813 --> 11:22.113
[all] Yeah!

11:23.416 --> 11:26.151
[Cubby] One... two... three...

11:26.153 --> 11:28.853
[Izzy] Four... five... six...

11:28.855 --> 11:31.222
[Jake] Seven... eight... nine.

11:31.224 --> 11:34.693
Yo-ho! For solving Pirate
Problems today,

11:34.695 --> 11:38.296
we got nine Gold Doubloons!

11:38.298 --> 11:40.832
[sniffs] What's that smell?

11:40.834 --> 11:44.469
Me! I call it <i>Eau de Coconut!</i>

11:46.939 --> 11:47.972
Eee-eee! Ooo-ooo!

11:48.874 --> 11:51.476
Ah, coconuts!

11:51.478 --> 11:53.044
[all laugh]

11:56.916 --> 12:01.086
Farewell, James!
May the wind fill y'r sails!

12:01.088 --> 12:05.957
Ta-ta, me dearest!
Thanks for the lovely gift!

12:05.959 --> 12:07.025
[sighs]

12:08.794 --> 12:11.129
Blast!
Now what have I done?

12:15.835 --> 12:18.002
<i>[Jake]</i> "The Golden Smee!"

12:18.871 --> 12:20.271
[Skully] What'd I tell ya?

12:20.273 --> 12:24.109
This is the best lookout spot
in all of Never Land!

12:24.111 --> 12:26.878
Sure is!
It's some view, huh, Patch?

12:26.880 --> 12:28.179
[barks]

12:30.883 --> 12:31.850
[growls, barks]

12:34.820 --> 12:37.055
What'd ya find, Patch?

12:37.057 --> 12:39.824
Whoa! It's a golden statue!

12:39.826 --> 12:42.193
And it kinda looks like
Mr. Smee!

12:42.195 --> 12:45.830
Coconuts! It does!
I wonder why?

12:45.832 --> 12:48.833
It's a mystery!
We should figure it out!

12:48.835 --> 12:51.770
Well, the statue looks like
Mr. Smee...

12:51.772 --> 12:54.405
...so we should start
by asking him about it!

12:54.407 --> 12:58.877
C'mon, Mateys, help us solve
the mystery of the Golden Smee!

12:58.879 --> 13:01.279
Keep a lookout for
Gold Doubloons.

13:01.281 --> 13:04.315
Whenever we solve a Pirate
Problem together, they'll
appear.

13:04.317 --> 13:07.552
Then we'll collect 'em and put
'em in our Team Treasure Chest.

13:07.554 --> 13:09.087
[Skully] Look alive,
me hearties!

13:09.089 --> 13:12.824
I spy the Jolly Roger over
at Shipwreck Beach!

13:12.826 --> 13:15.393
I betcha that's where
we'll find Mr. Smee!

13:15.395 --> 13:18.129
Then... yo-ho, off we go!

13:21.534 --> 13:24.102
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys aweigh </i>

13:24.104 --> 13:28.173
-  <i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>
<i>- Let's go!</i>

13:28.175 --> 13:31.576
<i>¶ Heave-ho, here we go</i>
<i>together as a team ¶</i>

13:31.578 --> 13:34.546
<i>¶ Jake and the Never Land</i>
<i>Pirates ¶</i>

13:34.548 --> 13:37.115
<i>¶ And me </i>

13:38.851 --> 13:40.985
- [barks]
- Wait up, Patch.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.453
[Jake] Ow!

13:42.455 --> 13:44.956
Jake! Did you stub your toe?

13:44.958 --> 13:48.026
Aye! My big toe!
Whoa!

13:48.028 --> 13:51.963
- Yay-hey, no way!
- Izzy! Help me catch Patch!

13:51.965 --> 13:55.533
[barks]

13:55.535 --> 13:59.938
All right! We caught Patch
and we got 2 Gold Doubloons!

13:59.940 --> 14:02.874
Let's grab 'em and
go find Mr. Smee

14:02.876 --> 14:05.410
and show him the
golden statue!

14:05.412 --> 14:06.978
You okay, Jake?

14:06.980 --> 14:08.613
Well, my big toe's
feelin' better.

14:08.615 --> 14:12.083
Cubby, do you know any
shortcuts to Shipwreck Beach?

14:12.085 --> 14:16.588
Got the perfect one, Jake,
the Easy-Breezy Pathway.

14:16.590 --> 14:20.024
It'll be easy-breezy!

14:20.026 --> 14:22.927
Crackers!
It's like a jungle!

14:22.929 --> 14:27.165
I thought hiking down
Easy-Breezy Pathway was going to
be easy!

14:27.167 --> 14:31.870
I guess instead of easy-breezy,
it's gotten real leafy and
tangly!

14:31.872 --> 14:34.973
I can clear the way through,
but it's gonna take a while.

14:34.975 --> 14:37.008
Patch! You lead the way, boy!

14:37.010 --> 14:39.010
[barks]

14:39.012 --> 14:41.045
This is too weird!

14:41.047 --> 14:43.882
First, Jake stubs his toe.

14:43.884 --> 14:46.384
Then Patch flies into the air.

14:46.386 --> 14:51.556
And now Easy-Breezy Pathway
is anything but easy!

14:51.558 --> 14:55.493
Ever since we found the
Golden Smee, we've had nothing
but trouble!

14:55.495 --> 15:00.198
Ya think the statue has
something to do with all these
bad things happening?

15:00.200 --> 15:02.934
Maybe, but I don't believe it!

15:04.403 --> 15:06.271
[Hook] I don't believe it!

15:06.273 --> 15:10.141
You puny pirates
have brought treasure?

15:10.143 --> 15:13.011
- For me?
- Not exactly.

15:13.013 --> 15:17.181
Patch dug up this golden statue
and we thought maybe it belongs
to Mr. Smee,

15:17.183 --> 15:18.917
'cause it kinda looks like him.

15:18.919 --> 15:21.552
Well, I'll be a
bottle-nosed dolphin!

15:21.554 --> 15:22.987
It does look like him!

15:22.989 --> 15:24.989
[Bones] Only shinier!

15:24.991 --> 15:28.092
Ooo! Why, it's solid gold!

15:28.094 --> 15:31.062
And it does resemble
you, Mr. Smee!

15:31.064 --> 15:34.933
Might I say, you
never looked better!

15:34.935 --> 15:38.403
You'll soon wish you never
laid eyes on it, sir.

15:38.405 --> 15:43.074
Because that is the...
Golden Smee!

15:43.076 --> 15:45.143
And what's wrong with that?

15:45.145 --> 15:47.211
When I was but a wee Smee,

15:47.213 --> 15:50.982
I heard many a family tale about
the Golden Smee...

15:50.984 --> 15:54.953
...and about how it can lead to
"The Lost Treasure of the
Smees!"

15:54.955 --> 15:59.991
Ahhh! It can lead us
to even more treasure?

15:59.993 --> 16:03.594
Oh, this day just keeps
getting better and better!

16:03.596 --> 16:06.097
No sir, it does not!

16:06.099 --> 16:08.700
Many a Smee has searched
for the Treasure.

16:08.702 --> 16:12.737
And they were never
seen again... ever!

16:12.739 --> 16:15.006
- Ever?
- Never!

16:15.008 --> 16:18.242
The Golden Smee is
trouble, it is!

16:18.244 --> 16:22.647
<i>¶ The legend of</i>
<i>the Golden Smee ¶</i>

16:22.649 --> 16:25.984
<i>¶ The legend of</i>
<i>the Golden Smee ¶</i>

16:25.986 --> 16:29.020
¶ A treasury of gold calamity

16:29.022 --> 16:31.589
<i>¶ You search for it</i>
<i>as you please ¶</i>

16:31.591 --> 16:34.726
¶ But beware you will despair

16:34.728 --> 16:38.196
<i>¶ The legend of</i>
<i>the Golden Smee ¶</i>

16:40.065 --> 16:43.501
[Cubby stammering] Maybe the
stories of the Golden Smee are
true!

16:43.503 --> 16:47.472
'Cause ever since we found it,
we've had nothin' but trouble!

16:47.474 --> 16:51.676
Well, this little beauty
is made of solid gold!

16:51.678 --> 16:55.747
If that's your idea of trouble,
then give me more...

16:55.749 --> 16:56.714
Wha...?

17:01.186 --> 17:02.453
[Hook screams]

17:07.026 --> 17:09.660
Golden Smee,
this is all your fault.

17:09.662 --> 17:12.663
What trouble will
you cause next?

17:13.399 --> 17:14.665
[chuckles]

17:14.667 --> 17:19.637
Ah! Save me, Smee! Anybody!

17:19.639 --> 17:22.740
C'mon, mateys!
Let's pull the Captain in!

17:22.742 --> 17:25.309
That's it, me hearties!
Heave!

17:28.781 --> 17:30.048
Ooof!

17:30.050 --> 17:32.250
Yo-ho, way ta go!

17:32.252 --> 17:35.053
We saved Captain Hook from
Tick Tock Croc

17:35.055 --> 17:37.388
and we got three
more Gold Doubloons!

17:37.390 --> 17:39.390
[Jake] Let's grab 'em and go!

17:39.392 --> 17:41.759
Maybe Mr. Smee is right.

17:41.761 --> 17:44.629
I bet the Golden Smee
is a troublemaker!

17:44.631 --> 17:46.531
Ah, pish-posh!

17:46.533 --> 17:48.666
I'd face a cargo hold of trouble

17:48.668 --> 17:51.669
if there was a lost treasure
to be found!

17:51.671 --> 17:54.772
Now... where is that
Golden Smee?

17:54.774 --> 17:56.674
[barking]

17:56.676 --> 18:03.081
It's Mr. Smee! He's headed for
shore... with the Golden Smee!

18:03.083 --> 18:06.150
We must catch up
with that runaway Smee!

18:06.152 --> 18:08.453
You're right!
He looks very upset!

18:08.455 --> 18:10.788
I mean the Golden Smee!

18:10.790 --> 18:13.391
I want that treasure!

18:15.327 --> 18:17.495
- [Sniffing and panting]
- [Hook] Blast!

18:17.497 --> 18:20.731
Does that scurvy sea dog of
yours really think Smee

18:20.733 --> 18:23.734
ran all the way to
Belch Mountain?

18:23.736 --> 18:26.404
Yep! Patch found his scent!

18:26.406 --> 18:28.739
[sniffs, barks]

18:28.741 --> 18:31.742
But why did Mr. Smee come
way up here?

18:31.744 --> 18:34.812
Oh, dear, oh dear, oh dear...

18:34.814 --> 18:38.116
I'm going to get rid of you
once and for all,

18:38.118 --> 18:40.518
you golden troublemaker, you!

18:40.520 --> 18:41.719
[Patch barks]

18:41.721 --> 18:44.655
Stop, Smee! Don't be a fool!

18:44.657 --> 18:47.358
I must get rid of
this thing, Cap'n!

18:47.360 --> 18:49.894
If one Golden Smee is
such a troublemaker,

18:49.896 --> 18:55.166
imagine what kind of mischief
the whole "Lost Treasure of the
Smees" would bring!

18:55.168 --> 19:00.238
I'd rather imagine what kind of
joy the treasure will bring me!

19:00.240 --> 19:05.543
- Boys! Grab that Smee!
- Er, which one?

19:05.545 --> 19:08.212
[stammers] Ah, both of them!

19:11.283 --> 19:13.851
- [Smee] Oh!
- [Sharky] Yarrrrr!

19:14.820 --> 19:15.887
Ah!

19:17.656 --> 19:22.660
I've got it!
The Golden Smee is mine!

19:22.662 --> 19:24.495
- Oh dear...
- [all scream]

19:24.497 --> 19:27.732
[all] Emergency!

19:28.734 --> 19:31.903
[Sharky] Help! Oh my!
Me poor poor heart!

19:31.905 --> 19:34.539
Pixie Dust away!

19:35.741 --> 19:37.909
Here ya go, mateys!

19:39.745 --> 19:42.180
[belching]

19:44.483 --> 19:47.685
- [all grunting, groaning]
- Thanks, Ms. Izzy!

19:48.388 --> 19:53.958
We saved Hook and his crew and
we got 3 more Gold Doubloons!

19:53.960 --> 19:55.660
Let's grab 'em and go!

19:57.229 --> 20:01.399
- Where is it? Where is me Smee?
- I'm right here, Cap'n!

20:01.401 --> 20:04.869
Not you! The golden one!

20:04.871 --> 20:07.405
It fell into the lava,
Captain Hook!

20:07.407 --> 20:09.273
It's gone for good!

20:09.275 --> 20:13.611
And I say good riddance!
We're all better off without it!

20:13.613 --> 20:16.214
Yeah! Because of that there
golden thingy,

20:16.216 --> 20:19.784
the Jolly Roger ran aground,
and then ole' Tick Tock Croc
showed up!

20:19.786 --> 20:23.955
And we almost got toasted...
like marshmallows!

20:23.957 --> 20:28.693
No treasure in Never Land is
worth that kind of trouble, sir!

20:28.695 --> 20:30.728
Well perhaps...

20:30.730 --> 20:33.831
Finding ordinary treasure
is trouble enough.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.733
Back to the Jolly Roger, boys.

20:35.735 --> 20:40.338
We must prepare for our next
golden opportunity to find
riches...

20:40.340 --> 20:43.741
Oooo! Maybe we'll find
a Golden Sharky!

20:43.743 --> 20:45.243
Or a Golden Bones!

20:45.245 --> 20:47.445
Or two Golden Bones! Or three...

20:47.447 --> 20:49.814
[Hook] You want to know what
else is golden?

20:49.816 --> 20:51.882
Silence is golden!

20:51.884 --> 20:55.853
Thanks for your help, sea pups.
It all ended for the best.

20:55.855 --> 20:57.688
You're welcome, Mr. Smee.

20:57.690 --> 20:59.423
[Patch barks]

20:59.992 --> 21:02.526
What is it, sea-pups' pup?

21:02.528 --> 21:04.629
[Patch whines]

21:04.631 --> 21:07.632
I think Patch is sad about
the Golden Smee.

21:07.634 --> 21:10.568
After all, he's the
one who found it first.

21:10.570 --> 21:13.571
Aw, fella, it just so happens,

21:13.573 --> 21:16.774
I brought a special treasure
just for you.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.576
- [chuckles]
- [happy barks]

21:19.344 --> 21:21.045
[growls]

21:21.047 --> 21:26.350
Look at him go! Patch thinks a
juicy bone is better than gold!

21:26.352 --> 21:30.288
Now that's a treasure he
can sink his teeth into!

21:30.290 --> 21:31.722
[chuckles]

21:33.292 --> 21:36.627
Thanks for helping us with the
Golden Smee today, mateys.

21:36.629 --> 21:40.831
Now let's put all our Gold
Doubloons into our Team Treasure
Chest.

21:48.006 --> 21:50.574
<i>¶ Weigh-hey,</i>
<i>well done, crew ¶</i>

21:50.576 --> 21:52.476

22:01.053 --> 22:02.420
[all] Yeah!

22:03.522 --> 22:05.356
[Jake] One... two...

22:05.358 --> 22:07.491
[Cubby] Three... four... five...

22:07.493 --> 22:10.328
[Izzy] Six... seven... eight.

22:10.330 --> 22:13.397
[Jake] Yo-ho! For solving Pirate
Problems today,

22:13.399 --> 22:15.666
we got 8 Gold Doubloons!

22:16.735 --> 22:19.637
- And Patch got something too!
- [bark]

22:20.639 --> 22:23.507
He must be digging up
another treasure!

22:23.509 --> 22:26.444
Nope! I think this time
he's burying one!

22:27.746 --> 22:30.948
Now there's a real
pirate pup for ya!

22:30.950 --> 22:32.516
[barks]

22:34.119 --> 22:37.555
[Hook] Ah, Smee, perhaps someday

22:37.557 --> 22:41.125
I'll find the
Lost Treasure of the Smees.

22:41.127 --> 22:43.127
[sighs] No, sir.

22:43.129 --> 22:48.366
The Lost Treasure of the Smees
is just a silly old story...

22:48.368 --> 22:50.835
[Smee] Silly, indeed! [laughs]

23:08.887 --> 23:12.156
