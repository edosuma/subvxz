00:01.667 --> 00:04.583
[Samantha] Once upon a time,
there was a girl

00:04.583 --> 00:08.333
who made the tiniest mistake on
the way to happily-ever-after.

00:08.333 --> 00:11.291
Yeah, hi, Todd.
It's me again.

00:11.291 --> 00:14.000
In some countries
it's actually considered rude

00:14.000 --> 00:18.667
to ignore messages after someone
has left 20 or 30 of them.

00:18.667 --> 00:21.625
Maybe not as rude as pretending
that you and I had sex

00:21.625 --> 00:23.709
to get rid
of your girlfriend.

00:23.709 --> 00:25.417
But it's close.

00:25.417 --> 00:28.000
Trust me, the new girlfriend's
no prize either.

00:28.709 --> 00:30.375
Anyhoo...

00:30.375 --> 00:33.834
Um, if you call me back,
maybe we can work this out.

00:33.834 --> 00:35.709
- [beeps]
- [makes explosion sound]

00:35.709 --> 00:37.959
Anyway, bye.

00:37.959 --> 00:40.750
- Good morning, Mr. Chapman.
- Is it?

00:40.750 --> 00:42.291
Is it, really?
My mistake.

00:42.291 --> 00:45.083
I thought this was the morning
Funk decided to drop in

00:45.083 --> 00:47.959
- for his twice-yearly visit.
- Funk?

00:47.959 --> 00:51.000
- Funk.
- Oh! Right,
the other name on the sign.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.959
Yes, the other name.
But you see mine's first.

00:53.959 --> 00:57.667
Why? Because one of us devotes
every minute to this place,

00:57.667 --> 01:00.000
while the other
travels around the world

01:00.000 --> 01:02.583
to attend to his little
billion-dollar empire.

01:02.583 --> 01:06.166
Oh! That's funny, I just always
thought it was alphabetical.

01:06.166 --> 01:08.166
Alpha...

01:08.166 --> 01:11.125
- OK, the point is, it's first.
- OK.

01:11.125 --> 01:14.333
- He wants us
in the conference room.
- Let's do it.

01:14.333 --> 01:19.000
The Wall Street Journal says
that Winston Funk needs no
introduction.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.458
Yet here I am once again,
introducing him.

01:23.458 --> 01:25.792
So here he is.

01:25.792 --> 01:28.041
Good morning.
It's a pleasure to see you all.

01:28.041 --> 01:31.000
[giggling]

01:31.000 --> 01:34.250
I want to apologize for the dust
my helicopter kicked up this
morning.

01:34.250 --> 01:36.166
- [gasps]
- Chase?

01:36.166 --> 01:40.000
And what the hell is that?
No one here is hearing impaired.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.583
Yet. The soul of success
is anticipation.

01:44.583 --> 01:47.000
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

01:48.500 --> 01:50.542
[mocking]
Someone's in love with Funk.

01:50.542 --> 01:52.667
Oh, please,
don't be ridiculous.

01:52.667 --> 01:55.792
Is he not the most adorable
billionaire ever?

01:55.792 --> 01:56.959
[chuckles]

01:58.000 --> 02:00.625
Good morning, ladies.

02:00.625 --> 02:02.875
- Scurbee.
- [chuckles]

02:06.959 --> 02:10.083
- What were you even
trying to say?
- I have no idea.

02:10.083 --> 02:12.542
- Do you see what he does to me?
- [whispers] Yes.

02:12.542 --> 02:16.083
God, he is everything I have
ever wanted in a man and it's
not the money.

02:16.083 --> 02:17.750
I swear,
it is not the money.

02:17.750 --> 02:20.041
I would love him
if he was just a millionaire.

02:20.041 --> 02:23.250
And he's getting divorced.
Should I go for it?

02:23.250 --> 02:27.417
Andrea, he is charming,
good-looking, rich and
available.

02:27.417 --> 02:30.625
- If you don't go for him...
- I will tear you apart.

02:30.625 --> 02:33.542
- I was kidding.
- Yeah, me too.

02:40.667 --> 02:43.208
- Hello, Sam.
- Hey. You.

02:43.208 --> 02:46.417
- Samantha Newly?
- Mr. Funk.

02:46.417 --> 02:50.250
The day we've been waiting for
has finally arrived.

02:52.750 --> 02:54.583
[inhales]

02:54.583 --> 02:56.000
Marry me.

02:57.834 --> 02:59.000
Scurbee.

03:12.083 --> 03:15.625
- Aren't you going to try it on?
- No. No, I shouldn't.

03:16.166 --> 03:17.625
I can't.

03:17.625 --> 03:19.291
Maybe just for a second.

03:21.375 --> 03:23.917
Whoa. That's heavy.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.125
Ah... Wow.

03:27.125 --> 03:29.792
It's flawless, like you.

03:29.792 --> 03:33.500
Whoa, there. Hey. You think
you can just propose
and then touch me?

03:33.500 --> 03:35.208
Georgette and I are through.

03:35.208 --> 03:37.500
Are you still with that
boyfriend? Ted? Fred?

03:37.500 --> 03:39.500
Frodd. Todd. No.

03:39.500 --> 03:42.625
- Then there's nothing
in our way.
- Yeah. Yeah, there is.

03:42.625 --> 03:46.291
Small thing.
Um, I don't remember you.

03:46.291 --> 03:49.917
Is this about my haircut?
Because I thought you'd like it.

03:49.917 --> 03:51.959
- No.
- You want to touch it?

03:51.959 --> 03:57.083
No. Look, I haven't told
anyone around here about this,

03:57.083 --> 03:59.166
but I think that maybe
you should know,

03:59.166 --> 04:02.667
since the rest of our lives is
hanging in the balance and all.

04:02.667 --> 04:05.959
But I was hit by a car,

04:05.959 --> 04:10.834
and I went into a coma,
and now I have amnesia.

04:10.834 --> 04:12.458
Ring's not big enough.
That it?

04:12.458 --> 04:15.208
No. No, that's not...
Wait, they make them bigger?

04:15.208 --> 04:18.208
You are never an easy sell.
I've always liked that.

04:18.208 --> 04:19.834
Look, it's the truth.

04:19.834 --> 04:23.750
I was out for eight days
and when I woke up I couldn't
remember my name,

04:23.750 --> 04:27.166
or my friends,
or liquid soap.

04:27.166 --> 04:30.959
I'm still a little fuzzy on
what an REO Speedwagon is.

04:30.959 --> 04:34.792
- Oh, my God. You're serious.
- Yeah, I just don't
remember us.

04:34.792 --> 04:37.208
Which is a shame,

04:37.208 --> 04:40.333
because I'm guessing
it was good. [chuckles]

04:40.333 --> 04:42.625
It wasn't REO Speedwagon,
but yeah.

04:44.166 --> 04:46.166
So, I'm sorry.
I just can't.

04:48.417 --> 04:51.709
Oh, hey, you know, but if
you're in the marrying mood,

04:51.709 --> 04:55.375
I can refer you
to a dynamite brunette...

04:55.375 --> 04:57.041
No. It's cool.

04:58.667 --> 05:00.125
I should go.

05:06.208 --> 05:08.458
I should probably
give this back to you.

05:08.458 --> 05:11.875
I don't want to.
There you go.

05:11.875 --> 05:15.166
If Andrea finds out that I had
a relationship with this guy,

05:15.166 --> 05:17.166
she is going to kill me.

05:17.166 --> 05:20.959
I accidentally ate her yogurt
the other day and she bent back
all my fingers.

05:20.959 --> 05:24.250
Ooh, a woman scorned.
That's such a great antagonist.

05:24.250 --> 05:26.542
Antagonist for what?

05:26.542 --> 05:29.208
I'm taking an online
romance novel writing class.

05:29.208 --> 05:32.667
- Really?
- My heroine
is a beautiful amnesiac

05:32.667 --> 05:35.917
with a dark past
and an uncertain future.

05:35.917 --> 05:38.750
My nom de plume
is Dena Devereaux.

05:38.750 --> 05:41.208
Well, don't base your novel
on my romantic life

05:41.208 --> 05:44.583
because Todd won't even
return my phone calls.

05:44.583 --> 05:47.041
So what happens next?

05:47.041 --> 05:50.166
I don't know.
Flip ahead and you tell me.

05:50.166 --> 05:54.125
Well, are you a heroine who's
willing to risk everything
she has

05:54.125 --> 05:56.083
to win the stableboy
she loves?

05:56.083 --> 06:01.291
Or are you a heroine who just
gives up and throws herself
on some rocks?

06:01.291 --> 06:03.834
Todd won't return
my phone calls.

06:03.834 --> 06:06.000
There's nothing
that I can do.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.542
Rocks.

06:08.792 --> 06:10.000
Fetch!

06:11.542 --> 06:13.583
They've had a hard day.

06:17.583 --> 06:20.500
Oh, Todd. I just wanted
to say that... You know what?

06:20.500 --> 06:23.208
You can ignore me all you want,
but just keep in mind

06:23.208 --> 06:25.375
that by now
I do know your routine.

06:25.375 --> 06:27.166
I know when
you get your coffee,

06:27.166 --> 06:30.625
and those big fat cinnamon rolls
that you just love so much,

06:30.625 --> 06:33.083
but then you feel so guilty
for eating them

06:33.083 --> 06:36.166
that you go and run off
the calories in the park
like a girl.

06:36.166 --> 06:38.917
Anyhoo, I'm just
checking in because...

06:38.917 --> 06:41.333
OK, Sam. You win. What?

06:41.333 --> 06:44.834
One second. I have to go.

06:44.834 --> 06:47.542
- It was you.
- [man] Cinnamon roll for Todd.

06:47.542 --> 06:50.375
I need you to know why I did
what I did to you and Chloe.

06:50.375 --> 06:53.542
- I don't care.
- It's because
I have these feelings...

06:53.542 --> 06:55.291
It doesn't matter.
Don't say it.

06:55.291 --> 06:57.750
You don't even know
what I was going to say.

06:57.750 --> 07:00.333
- I think I do.
- Oh, really?

07:00.333 --> 07:04.917
Well, maybe I was going to say
that I am having feelings...

07:04.917 --> 07:08.667
...about the situation
in the Middle East.

07:08.667 --> 07:12.166
And now you are never
going to hear them.

07:12.166 --> 07:14.375
It doesn't matter
because I'm with Chloe now

07:14.375 --> 07:18.166
and nothing you can say is gonna
do anything but make everybody
feel bad.

07:18.166 --> 07:20.166
And those are my feelings.

07:22.166 --> 07:25.667
Oh, yeah? Well, how is that
going to help the troops?

07:28.166 --> 07:33.000
[Samantha] And so, her yearning
for the stableboy unrequited,

07:33.000 --> 07:35.583
our heroine headed through
the dark of night,

07:35.583 --> 07:40.333
seeking comfort at the warm
hearth of her kindly but addled
parents.

07:44.834 --> 07:46.792
There she is,

07:46.792 --> 07:50.625
our beautiful, intelligent,
sweet, and naturally blonde
daughter.

07:50.625 --> 07:53.083
Hello again, Sam.

07:53.083 --> 07:57.166
Hi. Well, you're just not used
to hearing the word "no," are
you?

07:57.166 --> 07:58.959
I hear it all the time.

07:58.959 --> 08:01.166
It's that little noise,
right before yes.

08:01.166 --> 08:03.166
[Regina laughs]

08:03.166 --> 08:05.417
He's going to teach me
how to fly his helicopter!

08:09.458 --> 08:12.583
So, um,
what are you doing here?

08:12.583 --> 08:17.792
Or, "Hello, so nice to see you
again" is what we sometimes say
to company.

08:17.792 --> 08:20.375
Samantha,
Winston just dropped by to...

08:20.375 --> 08:22.500
He said we could
call him Winston.

08:22.500 --> 08:26.542
I came by to ask your father
for your hand in marriage.

08:26.542 --> 08:28.208
- And I said yes!
- [gasps]

08:28.208 --> 08:30.333
I didn't even think
about it.

08:30.333 --> 08:34.208
- Congratulations, honey.
- Wait. Wait. No. No.
No, no. Mother...

08:34.208 --> 08:35.792
- Samantha?
- What?

08:35.792 --> 08:40.166
Could you help me in the kitchen
for just a moment? Excuse us.

08:40.166 --> 08:42.166
A little nervous.

08:42.166 --> 08:44.083
- [shushing]
- What?

08:44.083 --> 08:47.500
When were you going to let me
know that a billionaire was in
love with you?

08:47.500 --> 08:50.542
- [exhales] Oh, God.
- He used to date
that girl from X-Men!

08:50.542 --> 08:53.709
Mom, I don't even know him.
I mean, how can I love him?

08:53.709 --> 08:56.166
Plus Andrea
is in love with him.

08:56.166 --> 08:59.166
Oh, Andrea. She just
loves him for his money.

08:59.166 --> 09:00.667
Yeah, so do you.

09:00.667 --> 09:03.208
Yes, but I'm not the one
marrying him.

09:03.208 --> 09:05.166
And neither am I.

09:05.166 --> 09:06.875
Why not?

09:06.875 --> 09:09.917
Any girl would jump at the
chance to marry Winston Funk.

09:09.917 --> 09:13.166
He's been on magazine covers.
He flies jets.

09:13.166 --> 09:15.083
The man could
snap his fingers

09:15.083 --> 09:18.041
and have every window
in this house weather-stripped.

09:18.041 --> 09:20.125
I said I'll get to it.

09:20.125 --> 09:24.250
You know Winston was telling me
about his jet, so I wanted to
show him mine.

09:25.625 --> 09:27.000
[sighs]

09:27.000 --> 09:28.500
[groans]

09:30.750 --> 09:34.166
It was nice of your mother
to give me the potatoes
to take home.

09:34.166 --> 09:36.250
She's gonna want
the container back.

09:36.250 --> 09:40.208
Whatever you do, please don't
lose the lid because she really
hates that.

09:40.208 --> 09:43.166
I hope my coming here
tonight wasn't too much.

09:43.166 --> 09:45.625
- It was.
- I know.

09:45.625 --> 09:49.208
But when I buy
a business, I also like
to buy the parent company.

09:49.208 --> 09:51.208
[laughs]

09:53.500 --> 09:57.458
So, um... it's cold.

09:57.458 --> 10:00.166
We could be in Barbados
by morning.

10:00.166 --> 10:01.917
You know
who likes the tropics

10:01.917 --> 10:06.375
and also bossing around people
from third world countries?
My friend Andrea.

10:06.375 --> 10:09.875
I want you. Just because you
can't remember my feelings
for you

10:09.875 --> 10:11.750
doesn't make them go away.

10:11.750 --> 10:13.166
I know.

10:13.166 --> 10:17.166
But that little sound after
"no," it's still "no."

10:20.166 --> 10:22.458
Since your accident
have you seen snow?

10:22.458 --> 10:25.917
[exhales] No, and I'm not going
to go to Aspen with you either.

10:31.458 --> 10:33.250
Oh, my God.

10:33.250 --> 10:35.458
How did you just do that?

10:35.458 --> 10:38.166
Never underestimate
the power of a man in love.

10:38.166 --> 10:41.166
Plus I could see it starting to
fall against the street light.

10:41.166 --> 10:45.125
- [chuckles] It's my first snow.
- Yeah.

10:45.125 --> 10:47.166
- Look at Mr. Fancy.
- You're welcome.

10:47.875 --> 10:49.166
You...

10:49.166 --> 10:50.500
You have a little...

10:55.166 --> 10:57.250
Hey! [laughing]

10:57.250 --> 10:59.041
- Mom!
- OK. OK.

10:59.041 --> 11:01.709
Now, you take a picture
of me and your dad with the car.

11:01.709 --> 11:03.875
[Regina giggling]

11:08.792 --> 11:11.208
They say a diverse portfolio
will protect you

11:11.208 --> 11:14.583
in a bumpy real estate market.
But this company thrives on
risk.

11:14.583 --> 11:17.166
If the market goes south,
we'll go north. Trust me.

11:19.166 --> 11:20.834
I can sell snow
to an Eskimo.

11:20.834 --> 11:22.750
[chuckling]

11:28.500 --> 11:30.458
- What the hell was that?
- What?

11:30.458 --> 11:32.166
- That giggle.
- Nothing.

11:32.166 --> 11:33.917
It's nothing.
It was the joke.

11:33.917 --> 11:38.083
Because you know, an Eskimo
wouldn't have to buy snow.

11:38.083 --> 11:40.542
What is going
on with you and Funk?

11:40.542 --> 11:41.834
Nothing! Nothing!

11:41.834 --> 11:44.166
I even kept mentioning
your name last night.

11:44.166 --> 11:46.750
- You spent the night with him?
- No, crazy.

11:46.750 --> 11:49.166
- It was just dinner.
- You had dinner with him?

11:49.166 --> 11:51.208
Yeah, but we were
with my parents.

11:51.208 --> 11:53.375
- He met your parents?
- It doesn't matter, OK.

11:53.375 --> 11:56.208
- I told him I'm not
gonna marry him.
- He proposed?

11:56.208 --> 11:58.208
- Just a little.
- [grunts]

11:58.208 --> 12:00.500
He proposed to the old me
not to the new me.

12:00.500 --> 12:02.750
I didn't know
that we had a relationship.

12:02.750 --> 12:05.166
You knew I liked him
back when you did have one

12:05.166 --> 12:06.750
and you just
kept seeing him.

12:06.750 --> 12:08.166
I know. I know.

12:08.166 --> 12:11.166
But you cannot blame me for
something I don't remember
doing.

12:11.166 --> 12:14.166
Are you telling me you have
no feelings for him now?

12:14.166 --> 12:15.583
Now?

12:15.583 --> 12:17.500
- Um?
- Um, um!

12:17.500 --> 12:21.166
See, I knew it, I knew it.
That's it. You know what?
I'm done!

12:21.166 --> 12:23.333
I'm done with you
and I'm done with Funk.

12:23.333 --> 12:25.792
If he doesn't want me,
it is his loss.

12:25.792 --> 12:29.542
Yes! Exactly. Wait a minute.
You're done with me, too?

12:29.542 --> 12:31.333
Yes. I am.

12:31.333 --> 12:34.875
I have been patiently waiting
for my old Sam to come back.

12:34.875 --> 12:39.500
But I better be careful what
I wish for because you, you're
definitely back.

12:39.500 --> 12:41.208
Oh, oh! Fine!

12:41.208 --> 12:43.917
I hate you and I don't like
your shoes today.

12:43.917 --> 12:47.166
If you fell off the face of the
earth, I wouldn't even care.

12:47.166 --> 12:48.792
- Good!
- [door slams]

12:48.792 --> 12:51.208
[sobs] Then it's more
billionaires for me.

12:56.166 --> 12:58.667
And then Andrea
stormed out of the bathroom.

12:58.667 --> 13:02.083
She had a piece of toilet paper
on her shoe and I didn't tell
her.

13:02.083 --> 13:05.166
I really think that this
relationship is completely over.

13:05.166 --> 13:07.458
[in a British accent]
Oh, pishposh.

13:07.458 --> 13:10.291
Contretemps and discord
are always to be expected

13:10.291 --> 13:12.792
between friends
with fiery natures.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.834
You'll stop talking like this
when you finish your book?

13:15.834 --> 13:17.208
One does hope so.

13:17.208 --> 13:20.208
Uh, excuse my interruption.
Are you Miss Newly?

13:20.208 --> 13:21.792
Yes, it is I.

13:22.917 --> 13:25.000
Yes, I am.

13:25.000 --> 13:30.041
Mr. Funk is outside in his car
and was wondering if you'd care
to join him.

13:30.041 --> 13:33.792
Well, tell him thank you very
much, but the answer is no,

13:33.792 --> 13:37.583
I would not care to join him.
I would care for him to leave me
alone.

13:37.583 --> 13:41.000
And that's what
I would care for.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.417
- As you wish.
- Thank you.

13:42.417 --> 13:45.625
- Madam.
- Oh!

13:47.166 --> 13:49.458
[Dena] "Abandoning all chance
of happiness,

13:49.458 --> 13:52.875
the heroine rebuffed the
advances of the mysterious
prince,

13:52.875 --> 13:56.208
even though there was no hope
with the stableboy,

13:56.208 --> 14:01.208
and her evil friend, Androgena,
had been trampled by oxen."

14:02.208 --> 14:04.000
You know what?

14:04.000 --> 14:07.166
Forget Todd, screw Andrea.

14:07.166 --> 14:10.041
You know what? I can do
whatever the hell I want!

14:10.041 --> 14:14.166
"And with that, the heroine
ran like the wind to the
prince's chariot."

14:14.166 --> 14:18.166
Please, don't write what I do
before I do it. It's just
creepy.

14:18.166 --> 14:20.792
- "And still she ran!"
- Stop it.

14:22.250 --> 14:23.750
Ooh!

14:31.542 --> 14:34.000
- OK.
- OK what?

14:34.000 --> 14:35.375
OK.

14:35.375 --> 14:40.208
I mean, you seem nice enough.
So why not?

14:40.208 --> 14:42.542
- Are you saying
you'll marry me?
- No.

14:42.542 --> 14:47.500
No, I'm saying that, you know,
maybe you can buy me coffee
sometime.

14:47.500 --> 14:50.542
A cup. Not a franchise.

14:51.750 --> 14:53.500
I smell cupcakes.

14:53.500 --> 14:56.083
Are you so rich
that you smell like cupcakes?

14:56.083 --> 14:58.166
Yes, I am.

14:58.166 --> 15:01.166
- No. Roger's wife
bakes cupcakes.
- [chuckles]

15:01.166 --> 15:03.250
And someone's bad at sharing.

15:03.250 --> 15:06.125
Anyway, here's what I'm
thinking. We should go...

15:09.208 --> 15:11.000
Are you going
to see Chapman?

15:11.000 --> 15:13.166
I am not gonna
take Stonehouse's workload

15:13.166 --> 15:15.166
just because his baby came
early.

15:15.166 --> 15:17.583
I didn't ask his wife
to do a 10K for cancer.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.083
Do me a favor.

15:19.083 --> 15:21.792
Tell him I am the perfect person
for the job in New York.

15:21.792 --> 15:25.041
But then you'll be gone and I'm
gonna be left here alone.

15:25.041 --> 15:28.959
No, you'll come visit. It's New
York. It'll be fun. Come on.

15:29.875 --> 15:33.000
- All right.
- Yeah. Get him!

15:33.000 --> 15:35.166
[grunts]

15:35.166 --> 15:37.583
I know why you're here.
What do you want me to do?

15:37.583 --> 15:39.542
The Stonehouse kid
weighs two pounds.

15:39.542 --> 15:43.792
- Don't give Andrea
the promotion.
- Wow, did not see that coming.

15:43.792 --> 15:47.375
You girls. You see? That's why
kittens can't share the same
ball of yarn.

15:47.375 --> 15:51.709
- [meows] I like it.
- I just think
that she's too valuable.

15:51.709 --> 15:54.166
To the company, I mean.

15:54.166 --> 15:55.792
- Done.
- Thanks.

16:00.333 --> 16:03.208
- What'd he say?
- Oh, my God.

16:03.208 --> 16:05.208
I tried my best.

16:05.208 --> 16:08.208
But he just...
he doesn't want to lose you.

16:08.208 --> 16:10.166
That is so not fair.

16:10.166 --> 16:12.208
- He is so selfish.
- I know.

16:12.208 --> 16:14.166
Honey, you're bummed.

16:14.166 --> 16:17.667
But, hey, I know someone who
needs a trip to the Sweet Sugar
Bake Shop.

16:17.667 --> 16:20.041
Let's get you a cupcake.

16:20.041 --> 16:23.875
There's this soccer game in
Madrid this weekend which you
might enjoy.

16:23.875 --> 16:25.417
I've owned the team a year.

16:25.417 --> 16:29.792
I thought if I bought a team
I might not find soccer so dull,
but no.

16:29.792 --> 16:31.750
I can't do this now.
I've got to go.

16:31.750 --> 16:34.875
Forget the soccer. We'll get
a hot dog or something.

16:34.875 --> 16:38.166
No. No, I just have
to take care of something.

16:38.166 --> 16:40.083
Rain check?

16:40.083 --> 16:43.792
Yeah, sure. Whoa.

16:43.792 --> 16:47.709
I can walk from here. Roger will
take you wherever you want to
go.

16:47.709 --> 16:49.208
Thank you.

16:53.750 --> 16:55.959
Thanks.

16:55.959 --> 16:59.834
Hey, Roger? Do you know
someplace called the Sweet
Sugar Bake Shop?

17:20.500 --> 17:21.709
Hi.

17:24.208 --> 17:28.208
I remembered that we would come
here when we wanted to feel
better.

17:29.291 --> 17:32.959
I... I don't remember why,
but...

17:35.875 --> 17:37.625
Look, I don't care
if you hate me.

17:37.625 --> 17:41.083
No, no. You know what?
I do care.

17:41.083 --> 17:44.166
Because best friends aren't
supposed to hate each other.

17:44.166 --> 17:47.542
I mean "best haters",
who wants that, right?

17:49.083 --> 17:52.041
I know that I should've told you
earlier about Winston

17:52.041 --> 17:55.792
but it just means that
I was so scared to lose you.

17:55.792 --> 17:59.125
Kind of like how you lost me
when I came out of the coma

17:59.125 --> 18:01.166
a completely
different person.

18:03.166 --> 18:07.333
I'm sorry that I never thought
about how hard that must be on
you.

18:07.333 --> 18:10.750
But, you know,
I'm not gone.

18:11.959 --> 18:13.208
I'm here.

18:13.208 --> 18:16.041
I guess, if you want me.

18:22.166 --> 18:24.667
We sit here
to smell the cupcakes.

18:26.291 --> 18:29.333
It's like eating them
but with none of the calories.

18:31.208 --> 18:32.709
Hm?

18:37.667 --> 18:39.166
Um, one more thing.

18:39.166 --> 18:42.083
It's kind of funny,
actually, uh...

18:42.083 --> 18:46.417
Do you remember that job that
you wanted in New York so badly?

18:46.417 --> 18:48.208
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

18:48.208 --> 18:51.709
- I kind of sabotaged it.
- You did?

18:51.709 --> 18:54.208
But it was only because
I didn't want to lose you.

18:54.208 --> 18:56.667
I'm really sorry.

19:00.542 --> 19:05.709
Yeah, well, I sort of killed
a job for you in LA.

19:05.709 --> 19:07.166
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:07.166 --> 19:10.083
You did that for me?

19:10.083 --> 19:12.875
We really do care
about each other.

19:12.875 --> 19:14.250
Oh.

19:16.083 --> 19:18.166
[Samantha] And our heroine
realized that

19:18.166 --> 19:20.542
even as she waited for
happily ever after,

19:20.542 --> 19:23.458
her friends would keep her
company during the wait.

19:23.458 --> 19:25.375
Friends...

19:25.375 --> 19:28.709
...and also a ration of the
sweet cakes that came in the
cups.

19:30.166 --> 19:34.208
And so the beautiful,
beautiful amnesiac

19:34.208 --> 19:36.333
decided to sit out
for a chapter

19:36.333 --> 19:40.166
and let the other characters
do whatever the hell they want.
She was tired.

19:40.166 --> 19:41.750
[doorbell rings]

19:43.166 --> 19:45.000
[♪ Supertramp:
Give A Little Bit]

19:55.750 --> 19:58.000
"Snap and shake."

20:08.375 --> 20:10.208
[doorbell rings]

20:12.625 --> 20:15.041
Todd.

20:15.041 --> 20:17.583
- What are you doing here?
- Who is this guy?

20:17.583 --> 20:18.709
Huh?

20:18.709 --> 20:20.291
Are you kidding?

20:22.333 --> 20:24.291
Oh! Nice shot, Mom.

20:24.291 --> 20:26.667
Maybe next time
you can give me two more chins.

20:26.667 --> 20:28.458
So who is he?

20:28.458 --> 20:31.667
Just some billionaire who wants
to marry me. No biggie.

20:33.542 --> 20:35.500
Look at this. Unbelievable.

20:35.500 --> 20:39.333
Yesterday you wanted me in your
life and you're all over town
with this guy?

20:39.333 --> 20:42.083
Um, you said that you never
wanted to see me again.

20:42.083 --> 20:45.166
What do you want me to do?
Sit around and not get married?

20:45.166 --> 20:47.166
[Samantha] And with fire
in his heart,

20:47.166 --> 20:49.500
the shy but smoldering
stableboy

20:49.500 --> 20:52.458
yielded to the stunning
blonde amnesiac.

20:54.041 --> 20:56.208
She was his destiny.

20:56.208 --> 20:59.208
Well, now look
what you made me do.

20:59.208 --> 21:01.417
Damn it, Sam!

21:01.417 --> 21:04.667
[Samantha] He was just
too dense to know it yet.
