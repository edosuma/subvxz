I have a

00:06.573 --> 00:08.208
I'm a time traveler from
1905

00:08.241 --> 00:11.277

-(Lena)
Previously...
-(Henri)
It's magic.

00:48.649 --> 00:50.751
Henri gave me a
necklace...
-Perfect!

00:50.784 --> 00:52.719
That made me travel to
the future...

00:52.753 --> 00:53.720
2018 is the
year.

00:53.754 --> 00:55.388
<i>Everything is so different</i>
<i>here.</i>

00:55.421 --> 00:57.758
-Are those trousers?
-Are you Amish?

00:57.791 --> 01:01.361
Lucky for me I still receive
his letters through our secret
brick.

01:01.394 --> 01:03.864
But now I have to convince
everyone I'm a regular
teenager

01:03.897 --> 01:05.866
and stay hidden from the
Time Collectors.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.601
I hope I'll be back home
soon.

01:17.678 --> 01:19.546
(Gabrielle) What is going
on?

01:19.846 --> 01:21.314
(students
whisper)

01:21.347 --> 01:24.551
Whoa... (laughs)
Total plot
twist.

01:25.919 --> 01:29.255
So, if she's Elena
Grande...

01:30.724 --> 01:32.425
(sniggers) ...then who are
you?

01:32.926 --> 01:35.128
That is a fair
question, Miss...?

01:37.531 --> 01:43.537
I can explain, I... I was...
It's very complicated... Hard
to explain the situation...

01:43.570 --> 01:44.705
Good
morning.

01:44.738 --> 01:46.106
(Gabrielle)
Yes?

01:46.139 --> 01:49.309
Forgive me for interrupting,
but I have paperwork for Lena
Grisky.

01:50.744 --> 01:54.147
Sorry it's late. The
computer had a glitch.

01:55.582 --> 02:01.354
It's nice to meet you, Lena. I
apologize for putting you in a
rather awkward situation.

02:02.689 --> 02:06.126
Let me know if you
need anything.
Anything at all.

02:08.829 --> 02:11.197
(Henri) 'This is going to
be a bit of a head
exploder,

02:11.231 --> 02:14.334
but if you get in trouble,
there is someone who can
help.

02:14.367 --> 02:17.938
He went looking for
you. Find Victor. My
father.'

02:17.971 --> 02:19.773
(to herself) Henri's
father...

02:24.444 --> 02:29.215
(horses neigh)
(church bells
ring)

02:31.952 --> 02:34.721
Our family's chronicles of
time travel...

02:41.261 --> 02:44.831
'The timepiece is
special. It's coveted.

02:45.365 --> 02:49.903
And the one who wears it,
the rightful owner, is the
chosen one.

02:49.936 --> 02:53.473
You must be very careful when
traveling with this
timepiece.

02:54.340 --> 02:56.409
Because this
timepiece is special,

02:56.442 --> 03:00.346
it's possible to trick the
Time Collectors and hide from
them.

03:00.380 --> 03:02.983
The inside of this
timepiece has a dial,

03:03.016 --> 03:05.418
and if you follow the
instructions carefully,

03:05.451 --> 03:08.221
it has proved to be
very helpful for
some.'

03:14.661 --> 03:17.998
(Henri) 'Dear Lena, here is
a plan to use your
timepiece

03:18.031 --> 03:20.433
to get rid of the Time
Collectors forever.

03:20.466 --> 03:22.503
Follow these
instructions and you'll
scatter them.

03:24.838 --> 03:26.607
My father wouldn't let
me travel with him,

03:26.640 --> 03:30.343
<i>but my big plan is to trick</i>
<i>the Time Collectors to bring</i>
<i>me to your time.</i>

03:30.944 --> 03:32.979
I know they hang by the
portal.'

03:33.013 --> 03:36.950
(groans, then
sighs)

03:38.985 --> 03:40.887
Going somewhere,
Henri?

03:41.555 --> 03:42.856
I thought we were taking
him hostage.

03:42.889 --> 03:43.957
(scoffs)

03:46.326 --> 03:48.294
(groans)

03:51.064 --> 03:54.300
21st century, here we
come.

03:56.903 --> 04:00.841
We talked about this. Don't
tell the plan to the man.

04:00.874 --> 04:05.311
Yep. We did? Don't tell
the plan to... Oh,
check...

04:05.779 --> 04:06.847
Oh!

04:07.714 --> 04:13.019
(swooshing and ticking
clock noises)

04:22.328 --> 04:24.030
There's no
questioning her
talent.

04:24.865 --> 04:26.967
That's
certainly not
the concern.

04:28.101 --> 04:31.037
But why did she
answer to Elena
Grande?

04:31.538 --> 04:36.777
She didn't. She must've said
Lena. I just assumed. I'm
sorry.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.679
Where is she
from?

04:38.712 --> 04:40.346
She trained in
Russia.

04:41.682 --> 04:44.585
Do the details really
matter?

04:44.618 --> 04:47.554
This isn't a school that
only recognizes prestige, is
it?

04:47.588 --> 04:51.024
Certainly not.
Talent comes
first.

04:53.527 --> 04:55.596
Look her up.
Now.

04:55.629 --> 04:56.697
Okay.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.803
Ohhh. She's so
pretty.

05:02.836 --> 05:06.773
(nervously) I mean... if
you're into that kind of
thing.

05:10.110 --> 05:12.613
No
way...

05:13.980 --> 05:15.949
(students gasp and
whisper)

05:17.784 --> 05:19.352
Whoa.

05:26.860 --> 05:31.131
But why didn't she correct
you? She's had ample
opportunity.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.466
Miss Grisky is frightfully
shy.

05:33.499 --> 05:35.435
She wouldn't dare
correct an authority
figure.

05:35.836 --> 05:36.903
Her
family?

05:36.937 --> 05:38.071
Tragic.

05:39.205 --> 05:42.976
They died in a fire a few
years ago. She has no one.

05:43.009 --> 05:47.113
A benefactor is providing the
tuition, but can't care for
her.

05:47.147 --> 05:52.352
What a tragedy. Of course
she'll remain here, in our
care.

05:52.753 --> 05:53.854
Excellent.

05:59.993 --> 06:03.096
(whispers) Not a word to
anyone. You'll stay here until
further instruction.

06:03.129 --> 06:04.731
It's crucial that you blend
in.

06:04.765 --> 06:06.066
(footsteps
approaching)

06:07.801 --> 06:11.071
(normal voice) All is taken
care of, Miss Grisky. I wish
you well with your studies.

06:11.938 --> 06:15.942
Wait! When do I get to go home?
Why aren't we leaving right
now?

06:15.976 --> 06:19.412
I can't explain right
now. I'll send word.

06:25.085 --> 06:27.721
Bree, how you pass your
classes is beyond me.

06:27.754 --> 06:30.423
This isn't even
her, it's from
1905!

06:30.456 --> 06:30.991
Sure looks like
her.

06:31.658 --> 06:33.059
Well, that's
impossible.

06:33.093 --> 06:37.197
(gasps) What if it's her
great great grandmother or
someone like that?

06:37.230 --> 06:41.535
So she's from Royalty? Named
after some princess from a
hundred years ago?

06:41.568 --> 06:44.671
What does that make her, some
kind of duchess or something?
Well?

06:44.705 --> 06:45.806
No.
-Yes.

06:46.773 --> 06:47.908
No.
-Yes.

06:48.709 --> 06:50.110
No?
-No?

06:50.143 --> 06:53.479
Well, find... out. I don't
know anything about the
Russian monarchy.

06:53.880 --> 06:56.182
There's zero record of her
at any big dance
academies.

06:56.983 --> 06:58.552
She was probably
home-schooled.

06:58.585 --> 07:01.588
Taught by some famous
choreographer who gave her
private lessons in a castle!

07:01.922 --> 07:04.991
And she probably has a
crown! And she probably paid
her way in here!

07:05.025 --> 07:08.595
Cool your jets, Thea. Stop
being such a drama queen.

07:08.629 --> 07:10.631
This is war. I've been
betrayed.

07:10.664 --> 07:12.766
Yeah... I'm not sure
how this is about
you.

07:13.133 --> 07:14.768
I bet Elena Grande's
furious.

07:14.801 --> 07:18.705
I'm sure she knows it's a
misunderstanding and is
working it out with the
office.

07:18.739 --> 07:20.941
And I'm sure it's a
scam.

07:30.851 --> 07:34.521
Phones away, or I'll
toss them in the
garbage.

07:34.555 --> 07:36.289
Lena, please take your
place.

07:36.322 --> 07:41.628
So together you will
choreograph a piece about
yourself and perform it for the
school.

07:42.563 --> 07:43.897
With a
criminal.

07:43.930 --> 07:45.298
And a pageant
queen.

07:45.331 --> 07:47.734
It was a dance competition.
(Copies) 'It was a dance
competition.'

07:47.768 --> 07:51.705
Must I remind you what a
privilege it is to be in
my workshop?

07:52.272 --> 07:54.641
No?
Good.

07:55.308 --> 07:59.780
Now. Tell us who you
are, through dance.

08:06.186 --> 08:08.088
(Dash) OK, let's
work on the
assignment.

08:08.622 --> 08:11.257
Alright, I'll
start. Give me a
beat.

08:11.291 --> 08:13.226
(students snap their
fingers)

08:14.194 --> 08:17.998
I'm Dash. Short for
Dashing.

08:18.031 --> 08:20.801
Tsss!
Nope.

08:20.834 --> 08:24.304
I'm from London. My
grandmother taught a dance
class in the courtyard of our
building

08:24.337 --> 08:26.507
and let me dance with
them.

08:32.078 --> 08:36.216
I'm Lena. Grisky.
I'm from the
pa...

08:38.051 --> 08:41.087
Erm, I trained with
erm...

08:42.823 --> 08:45.258
Could I have some music,
please?

08:45.291 --> 08:51.097
(Jeff beatboxes) (students
clap)

09:00.273 --> 09:04.578
She'll never keep up. That
much is crystal clear.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.981
(Dash) Yeah!
(Laughs)

09:10.350 --> 09:11.885
I'm Max
Alverez.

09:11.918 --> 09:18.091
No one in my family wanted me
to dance, so... no lessons, no
formal training.

09:18.124 --> 09:20.561
I taught myself
everything I
know.

09:40.981 --> 09:43.283
(students
talking)

09:43.316 --> 09:45.686
May I sit
here?

09:45.719 --> 09:47.954
Of course.
Sit.

09:52.392 --> 09:55.696
So you must be,
like, sick rich,
huh?

09:56.196 --> 09:58.098
I feel fine, thank
you.

09:58.131 --> 10:02.102
I'm not ill, it's just a
slight malaise from the
misunderstanding earlier.

10:02.135 --> 10:05.405
No. I just meant you're
from like, a fancy
family.

10:05.438 --> 10:06.472
(thud)

10:06.507 --> 10:11.011
What? I just wanna get to
know her. For the dance.

10:11.044 --> 10:13.680
Oh yes. Do tell us all about
yourself.

10:14.180 --> 10:17.884
It's so fascinating how
somebody can be one person, and
then poof!

10:17.918 --> 10:20.320
Seconds later, they can be
somebody totally
different.

10:27.293 --> 10:30.230
How do you know about my
family? Have they contacted
you?

10:30.764 --> 10:33.934
Erm... no. That would be
weird.

10:34.835 --> 10:37.403
So... royalty. How
fascinating.

10:40.073 --> 10:42.743
It's not really something
I'm comfortable
discussing.

10:43.343 --> 10:46.713
Will you leave her alone? You
jerks are being obnoxious.

10:49.716 --> 10:51.151
(snaps her
fingers)

11:10.737 --> 11:12.072
(Lena) Thank
you.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.412
(sighs)

11:19.980 --> 11:22.182
(reads to herself) 'Helena
Grisky mysteriously
disappeared

11:22.215 --> 11:25.451
from the Paris Opera
Ballet in 1905.'

11:26.086 --> 11:29.322
(magical tinkling
noise)

11:36.530 --> 11:40.000
I love Paris 2018! So full
of first-rate foods!

11:40.033 --> 11:42.268
Ah, give us a sniff,
Pinky! (sniffs)

11:42.836 --> 11:44.971
Are you joking? We have
work.

11:45.371 --> 11:49.475
We need to plan. And
execute. Not eat.

11:49.510 --> 11:51.444
Alright, I've got an
idea.

11:52.779 --> 11:54.715
And it's a good one, I must
say.

11:56.082 --> 12:00.086
He writes her little
postcards, doesn't he?
(Sniggers)

12:12.866 --> 12:14.400
Victor.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.340
(phone) How can I
help you?
-(gasps)

12:21.575 --> 12:23.043
Hello?

12:23.076 --> 12:25.245
Hello. How can I help
you?

12:26.880 --> 12:28.982
I don't know. Who are
you?

12:29.015 --> 12:31.184
I don't
understand "who are
you?"

12:31.217 --> 12:33.119
I'm Lena
Grisky.

12:33.153 --> 12:36.422
I'm sorry. I can't
find "rena crispy".

12:36.456 --> 12:39.793
Have you been sent to help?
I'm in a bit of a
situation.

12:39.826 --> 12:41.161
(door
opens)

12:41.862 --> 12:44.531
Okay. You need to spill
it. Who are you?

12:45.365 --> 12:48.034
I am sorry. I don't
understand your
situation.

12:48.068 --> 12:50.236
Yeah. That makes two of
us.

12:52.238 --> 12:56.276
She was inside... the
black rectangle thing.

12:56.309 --> 12:59.045
Lena. You need to spill
it.

12:59.079 --> 13:01.114
I'll give this to
you if you level
with me.

13:01.147 --> 13:04.184
I'm sure you wanna hear
what your Amish boyfriend
Henri has to say.

13:05.318 --> 13:09.089
(reads) 'I've come for you.
Meet me outside. All my love,
Henri.'

13:09.122 --> 13:10.056
Where did you get
this?

13:10.090 --> 13:12.358
It was taped to the
door. But Lena listen.

13:12.392 --> 13:15.295
I can't continue to
defend you to every
single...

13:15.328 --> 13:16.897
Lena, wait!
-Henri!

13:17.898 --> 13:19.332
(Henri) Lena!
Lena!

13:19.866 --> 13:21.935
Henri! Lena, stop! It's a
trap!

13:21.968 --> 13:24.004
Find my plan in the
chimney on the Garnier
roof!

13:24.037 --> 13:26.239
Go to the brick! Run,
Lena!

13:30.577 --> 13:32.579
Lena! Lena,
run!

13:35.582 --> 13:37.450
(Henri)
Lena!

13:46.492 --> 13:49.229
(both out of
breath)

13:49.262 --> 13:52.498
OK. You better start
talking. Like, stat.

13:54.300 --> 13:55.435
Okay.

13:57.003 --> 13:59.305
I'm a Russian
princess from 1905.

14:02.142 --> 14:04.611
I'm Helena
Grisky.

14:04.645 --> 14:07.413
Like, the exact
one that
disappeared.

14:16.089 --> 14:18.391
I'm a time
traveler.

14:18.692 --> 14:20.026
Wow.

14:20.060 --> 14:23.964
I know. This must sound
fantastical.

14:23.997 --> 14:27.000
But one minute I was in
1905, and then the next I'm
on the stage...

14:27.033 --> 14:28.502
At the
Défilé.

14:29.636 --> 14:33.607
Henri. He gave me this
timepiece.

14:33.640 --> 14:36.476
But he didn't know it was an
actual time machine.

14:37.978 --> 14:39.312
We seem to be
able to
communicate

14:39.345 --> 14:42.248
by putting letters into a
loose brick on the roof of the
Garnier.

14:42.282 --> 14:43.950
He said he left something
there.

14:45.285 --> 14:47.220
But how did he get
here?

14:47.253 --> 14:48.421
This is
incredible.

14:49.089 --> 14:52.559
I know. It's very hard to
believe.

14:52.593 --> 14:56.462
But please, you have to
trust me. I'm not
crazy.

14:57.731 --> 14:59.432
Or maybe I
am.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.402
Maybe this is all a
dream.

15:03.036 --> 15:04.938
OK, I need to sit
down.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.974
And what about the
Three Musketeers?

15:08.008 --> 15:09.109
The Time
Collectors.

15:10.176 --> 15:14.047
They're after me,
but I'm not sure
why.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.683
I'm sure Henri has arranged a
safe passage to get me home.

15:16.717 --> 15:18.652
Back to
1905.

15:20.621 --> 15:22.989
Okay. For
reals.

15:23.023 --> 15:26.660
We need to work on how you
talk, because it's a total
giveaway.

15:29.495 --> 15:31.698
What? (Laughs) This is so
cool!

15:32.265 --> 15:35.235
What? You believe me?
That I'm a time
traveler?

15:35.268 --> 15:37.971
Well, quantum
physics is kinda my
jam.

15:38.004 --> 15:41.074
You went missing in
1905, I looked you up.

15:41.107 --> 15:42.342
You can tell
that by looking
at me?

15:42.375 --> 15:45.546
Well... yeah. But your
picture was on the web page
so...

15:45.579 --> 15:50.216
I don't know what a web page
is, but I'm so grateful. Shall
we go to the Garnier now?

15:50.250 --> 15:53.654
Erm... Tomorrow.
It's past
curfew.

15:53.687 --> 15:56.022
But you have to make it
back in time for the
performance

15:56.056 --> 15:58.424
or you'll get kicked
out of the school for
sure.

15:58.458 --> 16:02.162
And if you get kicked out of
the school, then you'll really
have nowhere to go.

16:03.029 --> 16:05.566
We need a plan to get
you on that roof.

16:16.209 --> 16:20.446
Lena? Are you listening?
Trying to help you out,
here.

16:20.480 --> 16:24.618
(phone beeps)
Uh-huh... But this is
so amazing.

16:24.651 --> 16:27.287
Look, you match these
candies and then you get
points.

16:27.320 --> 16:30.390
And then there's more candies
and then there's more points!
It's just endless.

16:33.393 --> 16:39.766
Sorry. I'm... I'm listening.
I've just never seen
anything like that in my
entire life.

16:39.800 --> 16:44.070
Okay. Are you a good actress?
Cause you're gonna have to
fake an illness to get out of
class.

16:44.437 --> 16:46.640
Hm, I did a production of
the Twelfth Night once.

16:46.673 --> 16:47.608
Okay,
great.

16:49.209 --> 16:51.411
Once you're out, we'll
communicate via text.

16:52.345 --> 16:53.780
And that's the word
thing?

16:53.814 --> 16:56.449
Or is that the face page
thing where they post about
what they're doing

16:56.482 --> 16:58.318
and what they've
had for breakfast?

16:58.351 --> 17:02.222
The word thing.
Texting. Have I
overloaded you?

17:02.689 --> 17:04.224
No, I've got
it.

17:05.191 --> 17:08.394
'Hello, Ines.
Please texting
me!'

17:08.428 --> 17:12.232
(laughs) Text. Just, text
me.

17:13.700 --> 17:18.104
Yes, right. Cool,
dude.

17:18.505 --> 17:20.073
(laughs)

17:24.477 --> 17:25.679
(phone
beeps)

17:26.346 --> 17:31.818
(gasps) It... it
worked! It worked!

17:31.852 --> 17:33.119
So
what?

17:34.287 --> 17:35.388
(laughs)

17:39.760 --> 17:42.428
We couldn't grab her in front
of people, we've been
exposed.

17:43.830 --> 17:45.699
She'll keep looking for
him.

17:48.168 --> 17:50.136
We'll make him
cooperate next
time.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.674
You should try these
macaroons.

17:54.440 --> 17:57.443
They're heaven in tiny
bites.

17:58.712 --> 18:00.781
Fine. Be a
pouter.

18:02.248 --> 18:04.484
(Lena)
Ouchhh...

18:04.518 --> 18:06.152
(Ines) You okay
Lena?

18:06.186 --> 18:08.321
Suddenly, I feel quite
ill.

18:08.354 --> 18:12.125
Oh, my royal
constitution is so
delicate.

18:12.158 --> 18:15.829
It must be something you ate.
I told you about that smoked
salmon.

18:15.862 --> 18:19.833
Miss Grisky, Ines
will take you to the
nurse.

18:29.910 --> 18:32.145
This cardigan is
itchy.

18:32.178 --> 18:37.918
Never say cardigan again.
That word died decades ago,
along with your vocab.

18:37.951 --> 18:39.419
Got
it.

18:39.786 --> 18:42.222
Maybe I should come with
you.

18:42.255 --> 18:44.591
No, it's risky
enough that I'm
leaving.

18:45.926 --> 18:49.395
You've been so kind. Thank
you.

18:52.398 --> 18:55.335
Those dudes. If you
see them, run.

18:55.368 --> 18:59.506
Run as fast as you can and
text me. And I'll find you,
okay?

18:59.540 --> 19:02.643
Okay. You are a wickedly
cold girl.

19:02.676 --> 19:04.344
(laughs)
Almost.

19:05.445 --> 19:10.617
Ines. Thank you. I'll be
back in time for the
performance.

19:15.822 --> 19:16.757
(groaning)

19:16.790 --> 19:18.458
I say we just go get
her.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.627
And I say, we have to
go with the plan!

19:20.661 --> 19:21.762
I say we go roller
skating!

19:21.795 --> 19:23.229
Shhhh!

19:24.430 --> 19:25.932
You can't catch
me!

19:26.399 --> 19:27.968
Get
him!

19:28.001 --> 19:29.335
Ah!

19:37.811 --> 19:40.514
(footsteps)

19:43.316 --> 19:46.219
(pop music
plays)

19:46.252 --> 19:50.423
If her royal highness is
still pretending to be sick,
I can keep going.

19:50.456 --> 19:51.658
(Ines) Are you Madame Carré
now?

19:51.925 --> 19:53.727
No, but I am the
lead.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.629
There are no lead
parts.

19:55.662 --> 19:57.731
You know what I
mean. Where have you
been?

19:57.764 --> 20:00.266
We should just have a
transition that fills Lena's
place.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.669
(Ines) Actually that's not a
bad idea.

20:02.703 --> 20:04.905
No, not
yours. Yours.

20:05.572 --> 20:07.641
It says more about
you than you think,
Thea.

20:07.674 --> 20:10.544
You know, the constant need
to be the center of
attention.

20:10.577 --> 20:11.812
(Dash
laughs)

20:13.379 --> 20:17.584
That's quite good
actually. Thea, end with
one of your killer
arabesques.

20:20.521 --> 20:21.722
(Jeff) Oh,
beautiful.

20:21.755 --> 20:23.890
(all
giggle)

20:38.038 --> 20:39.439
I told you she wouldn't show
up.

20:39.472 --> 20:40.607
She
will.

20:40.641 --> 20:43.610
Let's just cut her part, she
doesn't deserve it anyway.

20:43.644 --> 20:45.445
Yes I
do.

20:45.478 --> 20:47.681
Holy to the moly. Are you
okay?

20:47.714 --> 20:50.250
I need to tell
you what
happened.

20:55.856 --> 20:57.858
(magical tinkling
noise)

20:57.891 --> 21:00.694
(Lena) I went to the brick and
found the letter from Henri.

21:00.727 --> 21:03.764
It was his plan to get
rid of the Time
Collectors.

21:03.797 --> 21:07.367
He would lead us all to the
same place so I could use my
timepiece to scatter them.

21:08.935 --> 21:11.805
But Henri doesn't always
have well-thought-out
plans.

21:11.838 --> 21:13.273
Get
her!

21:15.676 --> 21:18.011
'Set the dials to
this formation.

21:18.044 --> 21:19.680
If it works, it will
scatter the Time
Collectors.

21:19.713 --> 21:22.716
I'm not exactly sure what that
means, but I have to hope it
will give us a chance.

21:22.749 --> 21:25.085
The journal says it can
trick them. Cross your
fingers!'

21:25.118 --> 21:26.653
(exhales)

21:39.099 --> 21:41.502
(Ines) The show is
starting, tell me more
later.

Lena! Set your

23:47.828 --> 23:48.729
Get
her!

23:48.762 --> 23:50.496
Use the
scatter!

23:50.864 --> 23:53.199
Do it, Lena! We have no
other choice!

23:53.233 --> 23:54.801
Wait!

23:56.002 --> 23:59.105
Stop, Lena! You don't
understand the power!

23:59.139 --> 24:00.907
(Henri) Press the button,
Lena!

24:15.255 --> 24:17.791
Whoa. What
happened?

24:18.158 --> 24:19.693
Where is
Henri?

24:22.763 --> 24:24.965
Why are we back in
1905?

24:28.001 --> 24:30.003
1905...

24:30.971 --> 24:34.440
Henri? Where are
you?

24:38.311 --> 24:41.114
(dramatic pop music

25:58.058 --> 26:00.694
(audience
applauds)

26:13.807 --> 26:16.743
(Thea whispers) You were
supposed to wear black.
What's wrong with you?

26:18.912 --> 26:22.115
So did the plan
work? Where's Henri?

26:23.049 --> 26:24.718
He's
gone.

26:30.256 --> 26:32.926
It
worked.

26:33.727 --> 26:35.696
Henri,
please...

26:37.297 --> 26:39.733
Find me in
Paris.

26:48.975 --> 26:50.343
(dramatic music
