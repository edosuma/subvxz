00:09.877 --> 00:13.047
*

00:27.495 --> 00:28.762
(computer chirps)

00:33.534 --> 00:35.536
I've been staring at this stuff
for so long,

00:35.569 --> 00:36.837
it's starting
to make sense to me.

00:36.870 --> 00:39.373
And our algorithm
is closing in on the location.

00:39.407 --> 00:42.310
Hey. Were you guys going to
invite me to this party?

00:42.343 --> 00:44.678
Oh, Charlie, this party
got started a while ago.

00:44.712 --> 00:45.746
While you were off
on your sojourn

00:45.779 --> 00:47.348
in the wilds of
moral ambiguity.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.650
CHARLIE: Brute force data
crunching.

00:49.683 --> 00:50.484
What's being crunched?

00:50.518 --> 00:52.320
A crew hitting
Union Parcel trucks.

00:52.353 --> 00:54.522
Guys have a taste
for high-end electronics.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.257
They've hit 23 trucks
in five months.

00:56.290 --> 00:57.491
NIKKI:
Due to hit again,

00:57.525 --> 00:59.393
and the M.O. says
today's the day.

00:59.427 --> 01:00.628
Don and David are out

01:00.661 --> 01:04.465
on surveillance waiting for us
to zero in on the location.

01:04.498 --> 01:06.300
Error correcting code.
That's an interesting choice.

01:06.334 --> 01:08.136
Is that what
you guys are using?

01:08.169 --> 01:09.270
Yeah. Have been for weeks.

01:09.303 --> 01:10.604
Why? Do you have
a better idea?

01:11.672 --> 01:13.674
No. Just different.

01:18.279 --> 01:20.181
(trilling and beeps)

01:24.385 --> 01:25.286
(beeps)

01:34.528 --> 01:35.629
We've got five minutes.

01:35.663 --> 01:37.231
Get in, get out.

01:41.169 --> 01:42.102
All right. Got it.

01:43.471 --> 01:45.273
And we're gonna need an address.

01:45.306 --> 01:47.741
LIZ:
Hey. I just got a call.

01:47.775 --> 01:49.610
Backup alarm at the
Union Parcel warehouse.

01:49.643 --> 01:51.812
Brain trust
has it covered.

01:51.845 --> 01:52.813
Uh, nice map.

01:52.846 --> 01:53.847
Wrong location.

01:55.316 --> 01:56.484
Warehouse is
downtown on Grand.

01:56.517 --> 01:58.619
LARRY:
Grand. That facility

01:58.652 --> 02:00.588
was on our list,
but deprioritized.

02:00.621 --> 02:03.324
NIKKI:
Top of the list now, and Don,

02:03.357 --> 02:04.425
we got 'em.

02:04.458 --> 02:05.359
(trilling)

02:10.398 --> 02:11.732
How we doing, boys?

02:11.765 --> 02:13.267
Last load going on.

02:16.504 --> 02:19.407
Whoa, we got company.
Lock it up.

02:19.440 --> 02:20.374
Lock it up!

02:20.408 --> 02:21.709
Get the hell out of there! Move!

02:21.742 --> 02:22.610
Move! Move!

02:24.778 --> 02:25.813
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

02:25.846 --> 02:27.348
(alarm chirping)

02:27.381 --> 02:28.682
(tires screeching)

02:28.716 --> 02:30.384
(indistinct radio transmission)

02:30.418 --> 02:32.186
Federal agents!
Get your hands up!

02:34.922 --> 02:35.856
Gun!

02:35.889 --> 02:37.191
He's armed!

02:37.225 --> 02:39.927
(gunfire)

02:39.960 --> 02:42.263
POLICE DISPATCH: Shots fired!
Shots fired! Units respond!

02:45.799 --> 02:47.635
(indistinct radio transmission)

02:51.872 --> 02:53.807
Check this out.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.543
Two guys died
for a truckload

02:55.576 --> 02:56.610
of empty boxes.

02:56.644 --> 02:58.346
(loud slamming)

03:00.781 --> 03:02.516
(engine roaring)

03:12.593 --> 03:14.528
Take your positions!

03:14.562 --> 03:15.796
(gunfire)

03:15.829 --> 03:17.531
(grunts)
Fire!

03:17.565 --> 03:18.599
(automatic gunfire)

03:18.632 --> 03:20.468
OFFICER:
Get down!

03:21.535 --> 03:23.471
Man down!
Man down!

03:23.504 --> 03:26.607
Stay down! Stay down!

03:27.841 --> 03:28.876
Let's go!

03:32.012 --> 03:33.381
(tires squealing)

03:39.953 --> 03:41.289
(gasping groan)

03:41.322 --> 03:42.756
DON: Get a medic! Get a medic!

04:16.624 --> 04:17.458
What's up with your transfer?

04:17.491 --> 04:19.760
It's down to Oklahoma
City or Denver.

04:19.793 --> 04:21.395
Won't know
for a while.

04:21.429 --> 04:24.064
Either way, I guess, my
surfing days are over.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.699
- Hey, what have you got?
- Delivery truck

04:25.733 --> 04:27.501
our bad guys used
to get away

04:27.535 --> 04:28.802
found four blocks
from the scene.

04:28.836 --> 04:29.970
No prints.

04:30.003 --> 04:32.406
They had a backup vehicle. Pros.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.508
Except this time our
pros tried to haul away

04:34.542 --> 04:35.876
26 empty boxes.

04:35.909 --> 04:37.545
Tracking numbers
don't trace back

04:37.578 --> 04:38.712
to any senders.
Deliveries were all

04:38.746 --> 04:40.581
headed to dummy addresses.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.316
They got to have someone on the
inside.

04:42.350 --> 04:43.484
Sure.

04:43.517 --> 04:44.752
That's the only way they're
gonna get the info, right?

04:44.785 --> 04:46.720
Somebody tell them which trucks
to hit, which parcels to boost.

04:46.754 --> 04:49.557
Finding the inside man
is gonna be difficult, right?

04:49.590 --> 04:52.460
Union Parcel has thousands
of employees.

04:52.493 --> 04:53.961
Large numbers always comes down
to one guy, right?

04:58.065 --> 05:00.868
OFFICER:
Get a medic! Get a medic!

05:07.408 --> 05:08.676
You okay?

05:08.709 --> 05:11.645
How are we doing
with ID'ing the dead guys?

05:11.679 --> 05:13.347
DAVID:
Nobody local,

05:13.381 --> 05:14.648
but we're casting a wider net.

05:14.682 --> 05:16.817
They killed one of ours, right?
Stay on it.

05:16.850 --> 05:19.987
And, uh, see if you can
find Charlie for me, would you?

05:20.020 --> 05:21.355
DAVID:
Okay.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.695
ALAN:
So, I was on the phone

05:27.728 --> 05:28.662
with your parents
this morning.

05:28.696 --> 05:31.565
Wow. You talk
to them more than I do now.

05:31.599 --> 05:32.733
Yes. They
mentioned that.

05:32.766 --> 05:34.001
They're coming
to L.A. New Year's.

05:34.034 --> 05:35.503
So, I thought maybe
we'd throw them

05:35.536 --> 05:36.637
- a party at our house.
- Oh, no.

05:36.670 --> 05:37.671
Forget the house.
I've got an in

05:37.705 --> 05:39.640
with the maitre d'
at CafГ© Vicenza.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.642
Yeah. I recommended
his son for a JPL

05:41.675 --> 05:42.810
summer internship.

05:42.843 --> 05:43.844
Kid totally deserved it.

05:43.877 --> 05:44.812
DAVID:
Hey, Charlie,

05:44.845 --> 05:45.746
need some help.

05:45.779 --> 05:47.014
Yeah. Told him
you were between classes.

05:47.047 --> 05:50.418
Yeah, well, I'm not. I'm late
for-for a class with Galuski.

05:50.451 --> 05:51.719
I'll see you guys later.

05:51.752 --> 05:52.786
See you, Dad.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.722
Come on in.

05:56.557 --> 05:58.659
If you're looking for
an inside man, it would seem

05:58.692 --> 06:00.728
the heisted trucks are
our common denominator.

06:00.761 --> 06:02.563
I think that we should try
a Geographic Network.

06:02.596 --> 06:04.632
Yeah. It's where
I was going, too.

06:04.665 --> 06:07.435
It's a tool used
to track trends,

06:07.468 --> 06:10.738
like thieves stealing
specific items from trucks.

06:10.771 --> 06:11.672
The items themselves may lead us

06:11.705 --> 06:13.407
to where they're getting
their information.

06:13.441 --> 06:14.508
LARRY:
That's right.

06:14.542 --> 06:15.876
If we find our source, voilГ ,

06:15.909 --> 06:17.144
we find our provocateur.

06:17.177 --> 06:18.211
It's like a garden.

06:18.245 --> 06:21.515
If we know one type of insect--
say, a butterfly--

06:21.549 --> 06:24.552
is attracted to one type
of flower-- say a rose,

06:24.585 --> 06:26.587
then we can ignore
all the other flowers

06:26.620 --> 06:28.422
until we find
what we're looking for.

06:28.456 --> 06:30.023
Unless, um... well,
unless we don't find

06:30.057 --> 06:30.991
what we're looking for.

06:31.024 --> 06:33.827
I mean, I'm not trying
to horn in here, um,

06:33.861 --> 06:34.795
but a geographic network

06:34.828 --> 06:36.964
might also lead us to
a false conclusion.

06:36.997 --> 06:39.500
Maybe the flower
isn't the attraction.

06:39.533 --> 06:40.768
Maybe it's the nectar.

06:40.801 --> 06:43.571
And the sweetest nectar exists
in another area of the garden.

06:43.604 --> 06:45.806
So, I think we should use
a supply chain analysis.

06:45.839 --> 06:48.709
You know, that'll help us focus
on the larger data set.

06:48.742 --> 06:49.877
The entire garden.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.812
And it might lead us
to the real thief.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.046
This is one time the haystacks

06:53.080 --> 06:54.882
are gonna tell us
more than the needles.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.117
We got thousands of trucks,
millions of parcels.

06:57.150 --> 06:59.653
That is one
large haystack, Charles.

06:59.687 --> 07:01.555
The volume of data
could bog us down.

07:01.589 --> 07:03.591
Yeah, maybe, but maybe not.

07:03.624 --> 07:05.693
So, um, go with me on this one.

07:05.726 --> 07:07.528
Right. Go with haystack?

07:12.866 --> 07:14.602
Immigration ID'd
our two dead perps.

07:14.635 --> 07:16.570
All right, so
what we got here?

07:16.604 --> 07:18.872
Michael Maloumian
and Armin Talajian?

07:18.906 --> 07:21.575
Tourist visas expired
six months ago.

07:21.609 --> 07:23.677
I think they did
most of their touring

07:23.711 --> 07:24.845
on the Glendale Freeway.

07:24.878 --> 07:25.813
They're part of a crew.

07:25.846 --> 07:27.915
Boss's name is Lee Hagopian.
Solid rГ©sumГ©.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.650
Robbery,
hijacking.

07:29.683 --> 07:31.118
Based out of a strip club
in Atwater.

07:31.151 --> 07:32.219
Oh, yeah? Let me guess.

07:32.252 --> 07:34.655
David's got the car
all gassed up and ready to go.

07:34.688 --> 07:37.124
Ah, he went to find Charlie.
So, what about you?

07:37.157 --> 07:40.127
Ah, come on. You're not gonna
let a lady walk in there alone.

07:41.261 --> 07:45.699
*

07:49.537 --> 07:53.040
Looks like the spaceship
landed from Planet Dr. Phil.

07:56.710 --> 07:57.945
Auditions were this morning.

08:00.714 --> 08:02.916
You want to go undercover?

08:02.950 --> 08:04.785
I'll let you pick
out your own pole.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.820
I'm sure you got enough
of that yourself in Chino.

08:08.088 --> 08:09.222
Friends of yours?

08:11.091 --> 08:13.761
I've seen them around. Why?

08:13.794 --> 08:15.796
They boosted a Union
Parcel truck this morning,

08:15.829 --> 08:16.997
killed a federal agent.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.165
News to me.

08:18.198 --> 08:19.933
I've been here
since 7:00.

08:19.967 --> 08:21.234
Opened up my place.

08:21.268 --> 08:23.136
I got a roomful of witnesses.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.171
Yeah, I'm sure
they were watching you.

08:24.204 --> 08:26.707
Look, I'm a businessman.

08:26.740 --> 08:28.175
I pull down
seven figures here.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.843
I got no interest

08:29.877 --> 08:31.845
in knocking over trucks.

08:31.879 --> 08:33.146
You have
any more questions,

08:33.180 --> 08:34.748
talk to my lawyer.

08:34.782 --> 08:36.750
Maybe I see you around,

08:36.784 --> 08:39.587
and we'll see
who the real bitch is.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.922
I've busted gang bangers
in Compton

08:41.955 --> 08:43.891
with little sisters that are
ten times badder than you.

08:43.924 --> 08:46.293
You will see me around.

08:48.896 --> 08:51.932
*

08:56.369 --> 08:57.771
Hey.

08:57.805 --> 08:59.640
- Hey.
- What do you got?

08:59.673 --> 09:01.942
Our common denominator. This is
the link to the inside man.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.878
Pears?

09:04.912 --> 09:05.946
Bartlett pears. You know,
Aunt Doris sends these

09:05.979 --> 09:08.015
every year-- yours is
probably sitting in front

09:08.048 --> 09:09.016
of your apartment door
right now.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.018
Oh, joy.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.720
So, it all starts here

09:12.753 --> 09:13.954
with the barcode smart label.

09:13.987 --> 09:16.890
Everything you need to know
about this package is encoded

09:16.924 --> 09:18.025
within this label--
its weight,

09:18.058 --> 09:20.293
insured value, where it's coming
from, where it's going.

09:20.327 --> 09:22.162
Sorting centers-- they use
computers to scan barcodes

09:22.195 --> 09:23.964
to decide
where packages are gonna go.

09:23.997 --> 09:26.834
Problem is,
if this barcode is ripped

09:26.867 --> 09:29.970
or wrinkled,
or messed up in any way,

09:30.003 --> 09:31.839
computers can't process it.

09:31.872 --> 09:33.340
Humans have to,
and that package

09:33.373 --> 09:35.275
is designated as an exception.

09:35.308 --> 09:37.377
Yeah? And so?

09:37.410 --> 09:40.147
So, I found a package designated
as an exception

09:40.180 --> 09:42.683
on every single truck
that was robbed.

09:42.716 --> 09:44.051
Now, hundreds
of these pop up

09:44.084 --> 09:46.053
every day, but
the odds of one

09:46.086 --> 09:47.955
being on every single truck
that was heisted--

09:47.988 --> 09:49.723
that being a coincidence...

09:49.757 --> 09:51.892
Are about the same odds as me
getting a date with Heidi Klum.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.827
She won a Peabody Award.
She's great.

09:53.861 --> 09:55.062
Well, hold on. I mean,
how exactly does this help us?

09:55.095 --> 09:56.897
Well, there's one main
sorting facility

09:56.930 --> 09:58.999
for packages moving
through California.

09:59.032 --> 10:01.669
It's in Irvine, right?

10:01.702 --> 10:02.870
And there's
only one office

10:02.903 --> 10:04.071
that handles exceptions.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.105
So, whoever's leaking
information

10:05.138 --> 10:06.740
on the trucks to the bad guys,

10:06.774 --> 10:08.942
sounds like it's coming
from there.

10:08.976 --> 10:10.911
(overlapping chatter,
machines clacking)

10:15.448 --> 10:17.017
NIKKI:
Hell of an operation.

10:17.050 --> 10:19.086
Well, we have facilities
all over the country--

10:19.119 --> 10:22.089
worldwide-- but this
is our West Coast central hub.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.191
I wish my morning commute
went that smooth.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.893
11,000 conveyor belts.

10:25.926 --> 10:27.327
81 miles of track.

10:27.360 --> 10:30.898
Our computers sort through
three million parcels daily.

10:30.931 --> 10:32.632
Except for the exceptions.

10:33.734 --> 10:35.903
This...

10:35.936 --> 10:39.840
is where all
that gets fixed.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.875
Using data
recovery software,

10:41.909 --> 10:45.412
we sort out the problems
and issue a new smart label,

10:45.445 --> 10:47.114
sending the parcel
on its way.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.749
And putting it back on a truck.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.718
Looks like your techs
have access

10:50.751 --> 10:51.985
to information as to what else

10:52.019 --> 10:53.320
is on the trucks
they're loading.

10:54.454 --> 10:56.690
If this is about
the truck heists,

10:56.724 --> 10:58.191
you're barking
up the wrong tree.

10:58.225 --> 10:59.993
People you see here...

11:00.027 --> 11:02.996
this is their first day
on the job since July.

11:03.030 --> 11:04.131
I don't follow.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.133
I brought them in to fill in

11:06.166 --> 11:07.801
for my regular guy.

11:07.835 --> 11:08.936
He's out sick.

11:08.969 --> 11:11.071
You normally have one guy
do all this?

11:11.104 --> 11:12.139
Emerson Laidlaw.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.041
We call him the Scan Man.

11:14.074 --> 11:15.809
He can look
at a barcode

11:15.843 --> 11:18.712
that's messed up and--
like magic-- figure it out.

11:18.746 --> 11:20.047
Faster than a computer.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.082
It's a gift.

11:22.115 --> 11:24.017
A gift to me--
he's a prime suspect.

11:24.051 --> 11:25.318
Emerson's not your guy.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.820
How do you know that?

11:26.854 --> 11:28.321
Five minutes with him,
you'll see.

11:30.057 --> 11:31.024
(rapping on door)

11:31.058 --> 11:32.760
Mr. Laidlaw, FBI.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.795
We'd like to talk to you.

11:35.863 --> 11:37.397
(insistent pounding)

11:37.430 --> 11:39.399
Emerson Laidlaw, FBI!

11:39.432 --> 11:40.868
Open up!

11:40.901 --> 11:42.002
(faint, steady humming inside)

11:42.035 --> 11:43.270
Emerson?

11:43.303 --> 11:45.138
Are you okay?

11:45.172 --> 11:47.975
(humming grows louder)

11:56.149 --> 11:58.185
He's barricaded
himself inside.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.519
Call LAPD.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.054
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

12:02.155 --> 12:04.858
(shotgun blasting)

12:11.498 --> 12:12.732
Emerson Laidlaw!

12:15.502 --> 12:18.338
(grunting)

12:21.975 --> 12:23.010
Emerson Laidlaw.

12:24.144 --> 12:25.345
Emerson!

12:29.116 --> 12:30.984
(humming continues)

12:40.828 --> 12:42.429
(humming grows louder)

12:55.408 --> 12:58.411
(humming loudly)

13:06.553 --> 13:07.921
(humming mimicking
roaring race cars)

13:18.131 --> 13:19.032
DON:
Do you understand

13:19.066 --> 13:21.434
that you've waived
the right to counsel?

13:21.468 --> 13:23.136
I don't... I don't
trust lawyers.

13:23.170 --> 13:24.337
I say no to lawyers.

13:24.371 --> 13:26.106
NIKKI: We know that you've been
using

13:26.139 --> 13:27.574
your position
in the exceptions office

13:27.607 --> 13:29.176
to access shipping manifests

13:29.209 --> 13:30.911
in order to leak information
to Hagopian's crew

13:30.944 --> 13:32.045
on which trucks to hit.

13:32.079 --> 13:33.213
Leaks are bad news.

13:33.246 --> 13:35.015
I say stop them
before they start.

13:35.048 --> 13:36.816
Hey, an FBI agent
is dead.

13:37.951 --> 13:39.452
Okay?

13:39.486 --> 13:40.988
You are facing
the death penalty.

13:41.021 --> 13:42.255
I-I don't advocate violence.

13:42.289 --> 13:43.523
A great man
once said,

13:43.556 --> 13:45.025
"Make the most of yourself,
for that

13:45.058 --> 13:46.193
is all there
is of you."

13:46.226 --> 13:47.560
I make the most
of myself,

13:47.594 --> 13:49.129
but I don't
advocate violence.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.263
Look at me.

13:50.297 --> 13:52.099
You make, what,
12 bucks an hour, right?

13:52.132 --> 13:55.068
How is it you got half a million
dollars in the bank?

13:55.102 --> 13:57.137
I don't have a half
a million dollars.

13:57.170 --> 14:01.208
No, I have
$511,108.23.

14:01.241 --> 14:04.544
Tomorrow, it will be
$511,157.24.

14:04.577 --> 14:05.645
Compounded daily

14:05.678 --> 14:07.948
at our preferred
introductory rate.

14:09.582 --> 14:11.051
Hey, how you doing?

14:11.084 --> 14:13.153
- I'm Don Eppes.
- Hi. Tom Shorter.

14:13.186 --> 14:14.154
Emerson Laidlaw's
case worker.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.289
- I heard he was here.
- Yeah, that's right.

14:16.323 --> 14:18.191
And being questioned
without counsel.

14:18.225 --> 14:19.893
He waived his rights.

14:19.927 --> 14:21.628
My client is not competent
to give consent.

14:21.661 --> 14:23.330
I need to take him home
right now.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.132
Yeah, that's not
gonna happen.

14:25.165 --> 14:26.466
You've met the man.

14:26.499 --> 14:29.036
Okay, he's hardly
a flight risk.

14:29.069 --> 14:30.370
I'll make sure
he's available to you

14:30.403 --> 14:32.072
whenever you need him, 24-seven.

14:32.105 --> 14:33.040
Well, I need him now.

14:34.174 --> 14:36.009
Okay, well, I'll be back.

14:37.277 --> 14:39.212
- With a court order.
- Okay.

14:39.246 --> 14:41.514
Yeah, this is Shorter,
Family Services.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.250
I need
a legal consult.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.085
LIZ:
Family Services say he

14:45.118 --> 14:47.154
was flagged for a learning
disability at age seven.

14:47.187 --> 14:49.089
Mother
homeschooled him.

14:49.122 --> 14:51.224
She died two days after
his 19th birthday,

14:51.258 --> 14:52.559
left him a small
inheritance.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.627
- What, half a mil?
- Nowhere near.

14:54.661 --> 14:56.596
He's bounced around jobs,
IT stuff.

14:56.629 --> 14:59.099
The Union Parcel gig is
his longest employment

14:59.132 --> 15:00.567
at four years.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.602
Manager says
he's a model employee.

15:02.635 --> 15:04.304
24 truck heists, a pile of cash.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.339
- I say it's an act.
- I'm not so sure

15:06.373 --> 15:08.508
about that--
let me have a moment with him.

15:08.541 --> 15:10.010
All right, go for it.

15:12.545 --> 15:13.947
Emerson, hi.

15:13.981 --> 15:16.249
I'm, uh...
I'm Charlie Eppes.

15:16.283 --> 15:17.350
I'm a math professor.

15:17.384 --> 15:19.219
Math is an excellent
subject for me.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.153
CHARLIE:
Great.

15:22.455 --> 15:25.225
Tell me how many paper clips...

15:25.258 --> 15:26.326
you see right there.

15:28.128 --> 15:29.929
147.

15:34.701 --> 15:37.070
What's 364 squared?

15:37.104 --> 15:40.573
132,496.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.009
CHARLIE: The square root of
seven?

15:42.042 --> 15:43.410
EMERSON:
2.645...

15:43.443 --> 15:46.113
751311106.

15:46.146 --> 15:47.280
"Make the most
of yourself,

15:47.314 --> 15:48.948
for that is all
there is of you."

15:50.150 --> 15:51.751
Ralph Waldo Emerson.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.253
"Self-Reliance."

15:53.286 --> 15:54.754
I read that in school.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.224
My mother read that to
me every night at 9:00.

15:57.257 --> 15:59.059
It's important to
know, she said.

15:59.092 --> 16:00.627
Knowing it is important.

16:00.660 --> 16:01.961
Your mother named you
after Emerson?

16:03.396 --> 16:05.032
Yeah.

16:05.065 --> 16:06.566
She said I'd never be alone.

16:08.135 --> 16:09.336
Other Emersons...

16:09.369 --> 16:11.238
Emerson Fittipaldi,
race car driver.

16:11.271 --> 16:12.505
Drove the
McLaren M23

16:12.539 --> 16:14.774
to three Formula One
victories in 1974.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.343
Won four more times,

16:16.376 --> 16:19.512
beating Clay Regazzoni
for the championship.

16:19.546 --> 16:20.513
Roy Emerson,

16:20.547 --> 16:22.749
tennis star, won 12 Grand Slam
singles titles

16:22.782 --> 16:25.418
between 1961 and 1967.

16:25.452 --> 16:27.020
BRADFORD: Look, I'm a police
psychologist.

16:27.054 --> 16:28.555
It's not really
my field,

16:28.588 --> 16:30.057
but based
on what I see,

16:30.090 --> 16:33.060
he shows signs
of autistic spectrum disorder.

16:33.093 --> 16:35.228
You said his apartment
was full of stuff?

16:35.262 --> 16:37.164
Oh, yeah, packed.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.399
Obsessive-compulsive behaviors,
you know,

16:39.432 --> 16:41.668
like hoarding
can go hand-in-hand.

16:41.701 --> 16:44.171
The capacity to do complex
calculations,

16:44.204 --> 16:45.138
prodigious memory...

16:45.172 --> 16:47.074
yeah, he shows definite
savant capabilities.

16:47.107 --> 16:49.242
You know, and it's not like
this is the first time

16:49.276 --> 16:51.044
I've seen this kind of thing,
either, mathematical genius

16:51.078 --> 16:52.479
coupled with diminished
social skills.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.647
- Don't say it.
- What?

16:54.681 --> 16:57.150
Thing is, the students
and professors

16:57.184 --> 16:58.651
I've come across at CalSci...

16:58.685 --> 17:00.153
they're all far more
high-functioning.

17:00.187 --> 17:01.488
He may be as well.

17:01.521 --> 17:04.157
I mean, he's held a job,
lived alone.

17:04.191 --> 17:05.192
Under the pressure
of interrogation,

17:05.225 --> 17:06.126
he may be regressing.

17:06.159 --> 17:07.494
In a more comfortable
setting, you might

17:07.527 --> 17:09.662
be able to get more out of him.

17:09.696 --> 17:10.630
How do you explain the money?

17:10.663 --> 17:11.698
He's a hoarder--
whether it's a bank account

17:11.731 --> 17:13.833
or a room full of stuff,
the mentality is the same.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.735
Even a modest-paying job,

17:15.768 --> 17:18.438
after years of saving,
he could amass a fortune.

17:18.471 --> 17:19.639
I mean, he says he's the leak.

17:19.672 --> 17:20.573
BRADFORD:
I don't deny

17:20.607 --> 17:22.242
he's involved, but that man

17:22.275 --> 17:24.144
is incapable
of plotting a crime.

17:24.177 --> 17:25.212
Well, then,
he's protecting someone.

17:26.646 --> 17:27.847
You said he'd be
more forthcoming

17:27.880 --> 17:28.748
in a more comfortable setting.

17:28.781 --> 17:30.283
Maybe we can do something
about that.

17:33.453 --> 17:35.588
Oh, hey, uh,
have you seen Charlie?

17:35.622 --> 17:37.490
He left a voicemail
while I was in class.

17:37.524 --> 17:39.526
He asked me
to pick up some saltines

17:39.559 --> 17:41.461
and, uh, Cheez Whiz
at the market.

17:41.494 --> 17:43.530
So he has you doing
his shopping now.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.165
Ever get the
feeling we're just

17:45.198 --> 17:47.334
these celestial bodies
orbiting Charlie?

17:47.367 --> 17:49.536
Having trouble with our
resident genius, are you?

17:49.569 --> 17:50.837
Let's just say
our collaborations

17:50.870 --> 17:53.173
haven't been
so collaborative lately.

17:53.206 --> 17:54.874
Oh... there's one thing
I learned living with Charlie,

17:54.907 --> 17:56.543
and that is not
to take things personally.

17:56.576 --> 17:57.710
Of course,
if that doesn't work,

17:57.744 --> 17:59.579
you can always key his Prius.

17:59.612 --> 18:00.613
No, that's
too violent.

18:00.647 --> 18:01.481
You know, I
think I'll soap

18:01.514 --> 18:03.616
his windshield,
just see if he notices.

18:03.650 --> 18:04.684
CHARLIE:
Hey.

18:04.717 --> 18:06.553
Hey, sorry I'm late.

18:06.586 --> 18:09.289
Emerson, Emerson, uh,
this is my father.

18:09.322 --> 18:10.623
Dad, uh,

18:10.657 --> 18:12.492
Emerson is gonna
be crashing with us.

18:15.495 --> 18:17.830
He's watching
Iron Chef.

18:19.566 --> 18:21.434
BRADFORD: I thought maybe we
should check in.

18:21.468 --> 18:22.735
I haven't seen
you for a while.

18:22.769 --> 18:25.305
Oh, that would be
a tribute to you, no?

18:25.338 --> 18:26.606
Sure about that?

18:26.639 --> 18:28.475
Look, I'm in
a relationship,

18:28.508 --> 18:29.842
uh, you know,
a good place

18:29.876 --> 18:31.644
with the family,
with Charlie.

18:31.678 --> 18:35.348
The job is...
it's the job, you know?

18:35.382 --> 18:36.616
I mean, it's all okay.

18:36.649 --> 18:38.318
Clearly.

18:38.351 --> 18:40.387
I lost an agent
who had a wife and kids.

18:40.420 --> 18:41.421
Is that what you're after?

18:41.454 --> 18:43.623
Okay, now, that's a start.

18:43.656 --> 18:46.159
We may have found
our string puller.

18:46.193 --> 18:47.360
You lied to us.

18:47.394 --> 18:49.329
There's no way
Emerson Laidlaw is involved?

18:49.362 --> 18:51.631
I stand by what I said.

18:51.664 --> 18:53.600
NIKKI: Computer logs say
different.

18:53.633 --> 18:56.169
Seems you've been taking
an unusual online interest

18:56.203 --> 18:57.937
in Emerson's work
at the exceptions office.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.639
And we were wondering
who he was talking to

18:59.672 --> 19:00.707
about what was on those trucks.

19:00.740 --> 19:01.708
Turns out it was you.

19:01.741 --> 19:02.875
And you knew he'd protect you.

19:02.909 --> 19:04.611
Look...

19:04.644 --> 19:07.680
I monitored Emerson
because I was worried about him.

19:07.714 --> 19:09.349
- And why is that?
- He told me

19:09.382 --> 19:13.386
that he ran out of room at
his place for all of his junk,

19:13.420 --> 19:15.388
so he started
packing things

19:15.422 --> 19:17.557
in boxes,
mailing them

19:17.590 --> 19:19.626
and inserting errors
into the barcodes

19:19.659 --> 19:20.827
so they'd keep bouncing around.

19:20.860 --> 19:24.431
He's been using the Union Parcel
system to store his stuff?

19:24.464 --> 19:26.433
It's nutty, I know.

19:26.466 --> 19:28.201
Well, how long
has this been going on?

19:28.235 --> 19:29.402
At least a year.

19:29.436 --> 19:30.270
Maybe longer.

19:30.303 --> 19:31.704
And the trucks
that are getting hit...

19:31.738 --> 19:33.440
they're the same ones Emerson's

19:33.473 --> 19:34.907
- been putting his boxes on?
- That's right.

19:34.941 --> 19:37.710
How many does he have
floating around out there?

19:37.744 --> 19:39.346
I don't know.

19:39.379 --> 19:41.381
There's no way to find them.

19:41.414 --> 19:43.550
He buried the tracking numbers.

19:43.583 --> 19:44.717
Why didn't you
tell us this before?

19:44.751 --> 19:47.620
Emerson's like a son to me.

19:47.654 --> 19:49.222
I didn't want to
see him get hurt.

19:49.256 --> 19:51.591
These guys killed an FBI agent.

19:51.624 --> 19:53.493
Someone gets
in their way,

19:53.526 --> 19:54.661
they don't screw around.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.363
Now, you need to help us.

19:57.464 --> 20:01.334
I'm not saying this is your guy,

20:01.368 --> 20:02.802
but Emerson has

20:02.835 --> 20:05.472
this cousin
that takes advantage of him.

20:05.505 --> 20:07.740
They go to casinos and he gets
Emerson to do card-counting,

20:07.774 --> 20:09.776
that sort of stuff.

20:09.809 --> 20:11.244
The cousin--
what does he look like?

20:11.278 --> 20:13.413
He's got this, uh,

20:13.446 --> 20:15.348
streak of white hair
in the front.

20:18.451 --> 20:19.786
He's the one
you should be talking to.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.388
Yeah, I think
we've had that pleasure.

20:24.757 --> 20:27.260
You've got, uh,
quite an appetite there, huh?

20:27.294 --> 20:28.928
Yeah, f-four crackers,
four olives.

20:28.961 --> 20:30.597
I can't have four crackers.

20:30.630 --> 20:31.831
I-I need seven
on my plate.

20:31.864 --> 20:34.667
I can only eat seven crackers,
seven olives.

20:34.701 --> 20:35.968
Seven crackers,
seven olives, Dad.

20:36.002 --> 20:37.370
Right.

20:37.404 --> 20:39.372
(Larry clears throat)

20:39.406 --> 20:41.474
You know, earlier we were
discussing with Emerson

20:41.508 --> 20:44.444
his namesake's
famous 1836 essay

20:44.477 --> 20:49.015
"Nature" and how that set forth
the tenets of transcendentalism.

20:49.048 --> 20:50.983
Yeah, 1836 was
a good year for guns.

20:51.017 --> 20:52.985
The Alamo, th-the Battle
of San Jacinto.

20:53.019 --> 20:54.954
Samuel Colt patented
the Colt revolver.

20:54.987 --> 20:57.357
Arkansas is a good place
to buy guns.

20:59.592 --> 21:00.693
You know when you
send a package,

21:00.727 --> 21:02.462
you can track
it online.

21:02.495 --> 21:04.364
Well, the way
the system works,

21:04.397 --> 21:06.899
sometimes it takes this wild
ride all across the country,

21:06.933 --> 21:08.835
and at night

21:08.868 --> 21:10.703
when I can't sleep, I like

21:10.737 --> 21:12.572
to log on and see
where my package is

21:12.605 --> 21:13.873
and where it's going.

21:13.906 --> 21:16.709
Yeah, I know where
everything is-- all my stuff

21:16.743 --> 21:17.677
at all times,
all my stuff.

21:17.710 --> 21:20.012
Yeah, you know where
your stuff is right now?

21:20.046 --> 21:21.448
Yeah, box seven--

21:21.481 --> 21:24.584
Hummel figurines,
snow globes-- Omaha.

21:24.617 --> 21:26.786
Box 36--
clocks,

21:26.819 --> 21:27.854
model cars-- Cleveland.

21:27.887 --> 21:28.721
Box 121--

21:28.755 --> 21:32.859
calendars, comic books,
Swimsuit Issues.

21:32.892 --> 21:34.627
Emerson, these
boxes you're putting

21:34.661 --> 21:36.363
on trucks.

21:36.396 --> 21:39.366
You can tell us which trucks
you're putting them on, right?

21:40.667 --> 21:41.668
Okay, there you go.

21:43.836 --> 21:44.804
Yeah.

21:44.837 --> 21:46.339
No.

21:46.373 --> 21:48.975
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

21:49.008 --> 21:51.478
I need cellophane.
No, I-I need cellophane.

21:51.511 --> 21:52.745
I need cellophane,
no, no cellophane.

21:52.779 --> 21:54.414
Wood is no good, wood...

21:54.447 --> 21:55.615
(low hum)
...w-wood.

21:55.648 --> 21:56.749
No.

21:56.783 --> 21:59.352
(low, steady hum)

21:59.386 --> 22:00.453
It's okay.

22:00.487 --> 22:01.354
Just listen.

22:01.388 --> 22:04.791
Like the cars going
around the track.

22:04.824 --> 22:05.958
All right?

22:05.992 --> 22:06.893
Go around...

22:08.160 --> 22:09.095
...and around.

22:12.399 --> 22:13.500
(hums along)

22:13.533 --> 22:14.967
Yeah.

22:15.001 --> 22:17.737
Yeah.

22:17.770 --> 22:19.539
(cars whooshing)

22:19.572 --> 22:20.973
*

22:21.007 --> 22:23.976
NIKKI: Emerson's cousin Carter
has been a busy boy.

22:24.010 --> 22:27.079
Looks like he got his
master's in social work

22:27.113 --> 22:28.114
at Pelican Bay.

22:28.147 --> 22:29.148
Did a nickel

22:29.181 --> 22:31.918
for armed robbery
and got out five months ago.

22:31.951 --> 22:33.720
Yeah, right when the
truck heists started.

22:33.753 --> 22:35.555
Guy served time
with our two dead perps.

22:35.588 --> 22:37.890
Fresh out of prison,
he knows Hagopian.

22:37.924 --> 22:40.393
NIKKI: Mm-hmm, so this place is
like flypaper.

22:40.427 --> 22:41.661
You should have seen Don's face

22:41.694 --> 22:44.731
when I told him we were making
another trip to the strip club.

22:44.764 --> 22:47.534
Yeah, I'll bet.

22:47.567 --> 22:48.835
You and him have something?

22:50.970 --> 22:53.873
Had.

22:53.906 --> 22:55.408
Good guy, bad idea.

22:55.442 --> 22:56.743
Story of my life.

22:56.776 --> 22:58.411
Maybe my brother
was right.

22:58.445 --> 23:00.947
I'm in the wrong line of work.

23:00.980 --> 23:02.081
What'd he think
you should do?

23:02.114 --> 23:03.850
Marine biologist.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.718
(both chuckling)

23:05.752 --> 23:07.987
Told me I should swim
with the sharks.

23:08.020 --> 23:08.921
Who says you're not?

23:10.156 --> 23:12.024
My brother
is a gym rat.

23:12.058 --> 23:13.693
Golden Gloves.

23:13.726 --> 23:15.928
Taught me how to fight.

23:15.962 --> 23:17.797
He was seriously pissed
when I became a cop.

23:17.830 --> 23:19.799
LIZ: Why? He wanted you to be a
fighter?

23:19.832 --> 23:20.933
No, he just hates cops.

23:20.967 --> 23:22.001
(laughs)

23:25.872 --> 23:27.974
LIZ:
Oh, take a look.

23:28.007 --> 23:29.241
Our hunch
was right.

23:29.275 --> 23:32.111
Angling to get the early bird
special in the lap dance line.

23:32.144 --> 23:33.913
Mm.

23:33.946 --> 23:35.882
*

23:58.805 --> 24:01.107
Boss told me to buy
you girls some drinks.

24:01.140 --> 24:02.809
- We're on duty.
- Sure.

24:02.842 --> 24:05.878
You get liquored up,
you might lose control.

24:11.684 --> 24:12.985
Nikki, back door!

24:13.019 --> 24:14.987
(indistinct shouting)

24:15.021 --> 24:16.956
FBI, get out of my way!

24:18.090 --> 24:20.159
Hey!

24:20.192 --> 24:22.862
(engine roaring)

24:29.769 --> 24:31.938
Maybe I will
have that drink.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.949
Where is your cousin, Emerson?

24:42.982 --> 24:44.551
Carter takes me
to the casino.

24:44.584 --> 24:45.618
He lets me spin the wheel.

24:45.652 --> 24:46.853
No, listen, I'm asking
you whe he is.

24:46.886 --> 24:50.156
Emerson, the men your cousin
is working with are dangerous.

24:50.189 --> 24:53.125
Okay, they killed an
FBI agent in cold blood.

24:53.159 --> 24:54.794
We need you to tell us
where Carter is,

24:54.827 --> 24:55.595
we need you
to tell us

24:55.628 --> 24:57.864
which trucks your
boxes are on.

24:57.897 --> 24:59.766
I spin the wheel at the casino.

24:59.799 --> 25:00.933
If we know the trucks,

25:00.967 --> 25:01.601
we can stop them, Emerson,
we can protect your cousin.

25:01.634 --> 25:02.669
I watch the wheel go around.

25:02.702 --> 25:05.104
- Tick, tick, tick...
- Hold on, you understand

25:05.137 --> 25:06.305
- he could end up dead?
- Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick,

25:06.338 --> 25:08.541
- tick, tick, tick, tick...
- Pressuring him won't work.

25:08.575 --> 25:11.110
All right,
I-I got to get some air.

25:11.143 --> 25:12.579
At this point, I think
there's only one place

25:12.612 --> 25:16.583
he's really going
to feel safe enough to talk.

25:16.616 --> 25:17.550
Home.

25:17.584 --> 25:19.552
NIKKI: Got an APB out on the
cousin's car.

25:19.586 --> 25:21.187
Description,
partial plate.

25:21.220 --> 25:22.555
Who knows? Maybe
we'll get lucky.

25:22.589 --> 25:23.556
Our guy's
probably dumped it

25:23.590 --> 25:24.624
at LAX long-term parking
by now.

25:24.657 --> 25:25.457
So what do we do?

25:25.491 --> 25:26.559
Well, you know,
I've been thinking.

25:26.593 --> 25:28.160
Laidlaw seemed pretty at home
at that strip club,

25:28.194 --> 25:29.295
and it looked to me

25:29.328 --> 25:32.198
like those girls weren't doing
much earning onstage.

25:32.231 --> 25:34.300
So maybe they supplement
their income

25:34.333 --> 25:35.668
by going home
with the clientele.

25:35.702 --> 25:36.736
I mean, even a
mope like Laidlaw

25:36.769 --> 25:37.870
could help
make ends meet.

25:37.904 --> 25:39.105
I say we hit the joint

25:39.138 --> 25:40.973
one more time,
wave enough 20s around,

25:41.007 --> 25:43.175
maybe someone will give us
an address.

25:43.209 --> 25:45.645
Yeah, the--
yeah, the maps go in first.

25:45.678 --> 25:47.614
Rand McNally.

25:47.647 --> 25:50.617
David seems to really
understand him.

25:50.650 --> 25:52.118
The information's
in his head.

25:52.151 --> 25:53.986
I, I don't know
how to get to it.

25:54.020 --> 25:56.288
Well, you'll
figure it out.

25:56.322 --> 25:59.258
By the way, did you call that
restaurant about New Year's?

25:59.291 --> 25:59.892
That's a long ways off.

25:59.926 --> 26:00.860
No, it's not
that long.

26:00.893 --> 26:02.862
Well, I've been busy,
you know, FBI stuff.

26:02.895 --> 26:04.597
Everything else
takes a backseat.

26:04.631 --> 26:06.232
Yeah, or everyone
else, so I've heard.

26:06.265 --> 26:08.701
Oh, you know, I knew
as soon as I opened my mouth

26:08.735 --> 26:10.102
that I was stepping on toes,

26:10.136 --> 26:12.905
but Amita's geographic network
was not going to work.

26:12.939 --> 26:14.707
What else
could I do?

26:14.741 --> 26:16.042
- You think I'm wrong.
- I think

26:16.075 --> 26:17.710
if I go to the trouble

26:17.744 --> 26:19.311
of throwing a New Year's party
for Amita's parents,

26:19.345 --> 26:22.148
it would be really nice
if you two were still dating.

26:29.822 --> 26:30.823
EMERSON:
Wrong.

26:30.857 --> 26:32.759
DAVID: It's okay, they just
replaced the door.

26:32.792 --> 26:36.262
We're going to get it painted
same as the old one.

26:36.295 --> 26:38.765
(door unlocking)

26:38.798 --> 26:41.100
It's not right.

26:41.133 --> 26:42.669
- It's not right.
- What's wrong?

26:42.702 --> 26:43.803
Two wrongs don't make a right.

26:43.836 --> 26:45.337
- It's wrong, wrong.
- No,

26:45.371 --> 26:46.806
they're going to paint this
door.

26:46.839 --> 26:47.674
It's wrong.

26:47.707 --> 26:48.808
- Right?
- His TV-- do you have his TV?

26:48.841 --> 26:49.809
Yeah.

26:49.842 --> 26:51.410
Came in, took photos,
and moved stuff around.

26:51.443 --> 26:52.812
If things are off
even by an inch, it...

26:52.845 --> 26:54.681
Wrong, wrong.

26:54.714 --> 26:55.915
Okay, Emerson.

26:55.948 --> 26:57.784
- Wrong.
- Here you go, buddy.

26:57.817 --> 27:00.119
TV HOST: And Justin Browning is
getting ready

27:00.152 --> 27:01.654
- to spin the big wheel.
- Yeah.

27:01.688 --> 27:03.622
Yeah.

27:07.827 --> 27:10.062
(race car announcer
speaking indistinctly)

27:10.096 --> 27:12.164
CHARLIE:
How do you know so much?

27:12.198 --> 27:14.767
I had an uncle with a lot
of the same issues--

27:14.801 --> 27:16.202
not the math genius stuff,

27:16.235 --> 27:18.370
but he had
all the rest of it.

27:18.404 --> 27:20.673
My mom made sure
that nobody treated

27:20.707 --> 27:22.341
her little brother
like he had a disorder.

27:22.374 --> 27:23.743
You know, she...

27:23.776 --> 27:25.778
told all of us to look at it

27:25.812 --> 27:28.247
like it was a... it was a gift.

27:28.280 --> 27:31.083
Once you accept
that they see the world

27:31.117 --> 27:33.085
in ways
that you and I don't,

27:33.119 --> 27:37.156
then you, you just begin
to understand a little bit.

27:43.062 --> 27:44.997
Hey, listen,
I need to see the SID photos

27:45.031 --> 27:46.699
of the apartment
before it was searched.

27:46.733 --> 27:48.434
I need to know
where everything was exactly.

27:52.438 --> 27:54.406
I think I figured out
how to determine

27:54.440 --> 27:57.243
which trucks Emerson was putting
his stuff on,

27:57.276 --> 27:59.178
but I'm gonna need the help
of two colleagues

27:59.211 --> 28:00.747
that wrote a paper
on fractal analysis

28:00.780 --> 28:01.447
to do that.

28:03.816 --> 28:05.952
I know you guys are,
uh, mad at me,

28:05.985 --> 28:08.387
but I had to make sure we were
going down the right path.

28:08.420 --> 28:09.822
No, your path.

28:09.856 --> 28:11.824
This time.

28:11.858 --> 28:14.861
I know, I know what it feels
like to be underappreciated--

28:14.894 --> 28:16.295
not having
my security clearance,

28:16.328 --> 28:18.297
not being able to work
for the FBI-- so...

28:18.330 --> 28:21.100
please cut me some slack
while I,

28:21.133 --> 28:23.035
while I try to climb
back on the horse.

28:23.069 --> 28:24.837
Yeah, well,
Charles,

28:24.871 --> 28:27.974
as I recall, the sum
of your equestrian experience

28:28.007 --> 28:30.910
was one midnight ride
on an old gray mare

28:30.943 --> 28:32.779
straight into the
cranberry bog at Princeton.

28:35.014 --> 28:37.750
You mentioned fractal analysis?

28:37.784 --> 28:38.851
I did.
Well, it came to me

28:38.885 --> 28:41.487
while I was staring
at a poster of a drip painting

28:41.520 --> 28:42.789
on Emerson's wall.

28:42.822 --> 28:43.856
You know, just how
he sees the world,

28:43.890 --> 28:46.325
through an abstract painting
or through a barcode

28:46.358 --> 28:47.827
or the way
he arranges

28:47.860 --> 28:49.829
the seemingly random clutter
in his apartment...

28:49.862 --> 28:52.464
So it's all part of a larger
design, a fractal pattern.

28:52.498 --> 28:53.966
We know how
action painters

28:54.000 --> 28:55.101
create a piece of art--

28:55.134 --> 28:58.838
by applying a series of
seemingly chaotic paint drips...

28:58.871 --> 29:00.807
Each layer adding complexity...

29:00.840 --> 29:03.810
Fine-tuning
the recurring fractal pattern.

29:03.843 --> 29:05.812
Applying that analysis
to Emerson...

29:05.845 --> 29:07.346
His apartment becomes
the canvas,

29:07.379 --> 29:08.347
and the objects in it

29:08.380 --> 29:10.850
each forming their own layers
of complexity.

29:10.883 --> 29:12.852
Now, if we deconstruct
the pattern...

29:12.885 --> 29:14.854
We can determine
where he's been hiding his boxes

29:14.887 --> 29:16.823
within the Union Parcel system.

29:16.856 --> 29:20.259
Add to that a little
geographic network overlay.

29:20.292 --> 29:21.360
Your idea.

29:21.393 --> 29:22.929
So, um, what
do you say?

29:22.962 --> 29:25.497
You guys, uh, you guys in?

29:27.934 --> 29:30.236
Last time we
were here,

29:30.269 --> 29:32.071
we started a conversation
we didn't finish.

29:32.104 --> 29:36.008
We didn't?

29:36.042 --> 29:37.844
Okay.

29:37.877 --> 29:39.812
You want to keep running,
that's your choice,

29:39.846 --> 29:43.883
but I don't have to tell you--
guys who run get caught.

29:43.916 --> 29:45.317
There's a lot of stuff.

29:45.351 --> 29:47.386
I mean, even Charlie
and his clearance

29:47.419 --> 29:48.955
and the way he got it back.

29:48.988 --> 29:50.289
How's that?

29:50.322 --> 29:51.958
This guy just wanted
to blackball him.

29:51.991 --> 29:54.126
And, I mean, really
he was after me.

29:54.160 --> 29:55.527
Obviously he failed.

29:55.561 --> 29:57.563
It feels like...

29:57.596 --> 30:00.599
FBI is all I'm good at.

30:00.632 --> 30:01.968
But?

30:02.001 --> 30:04.270
Well, no, I feel
like that's...

30:04.303 --> 30:06.205
that's all there is.

30:09.241 --> 30:11.243
Um, using fractal analysis,

30:11.277 --> 30:13.279
we were able to identify
Emerson's boxes

30:13.312 --> 30:14.981
within the Union
Parcel system.

30:15.014 --> 30:16.615
See, that's a fractal pattern.

30:16.648 --> 30:19.051
Now, we found all 177 parcels.

30:19.085 --> 30:22.088
The only problem--
26 have disappeared.

30:22.121 --> 30:24.590
The exact number of empty boxes

30:24.623 --> 30:25.958
found in the getaway van.

30:25.992 --> 30:27.426
The day of the
warehouse heist,

30:27.459 --> 30:28.961
the thieves pulled a switch.

30:28.995 --> 30:31.297
They cherry-picked
the 26 empty boxes

30:31.330 --> 30:32.865
and replaced them
with 26 others.

30:32.899 --> 30:35.267
According to Union
Parcel's records,

30:35.301 --> 30:36.936
the boxes the thieves
put in the system are

30:36.969 --> 30:38.470
on their way to a facility
where high-value

30:38.504 --> 30:40.572
- items are stored overnight.
- He's right--

30:40.606 --> 30:42.208
normally they would go through
the screening process,

30:42.241 --> 30:43.309
but they avoided that

30:43.342 --> 30:46.045
by inserting them upstream

30:46.078 --> 30:47.279
using Emerson.

30:47.313 --> 30:48.915
That same facility
just got a shipment

30:48.948 --> 30:50.149
of gold bullion.

30:50.182 --> 30:52.151
$8 million, on its way to Dubai.

30:52.184 --> 30:53.252
It's in a vault.

30:53.285 --> 30:54.954
So this whole thing's
a Trojan horse.

30:54.987 --> 30:56.588
They're plan is to bust
into the vault.

30:56.622 --> 30:59.225
And they're using whatever it is
in those boxes to do it.

30:59.258 --> 31:00.893
One of the strippers

31:00.927 --> 31:03.062
came through with an address
on Emerson's cousin.

31:03.095 --> 31:05.197
Manager caught the cousin
running a card game

31:05.231 --> 31:06.933
out of his room
two nights ago.

31:06.966 --> 31:08.968
Gave him a week
to move out.

31:09.001 --> 31:10.937
He's gonna be out faster
than that.

31:25.952 --> 31:26.618
Clear.

31:36.095 --> 31:37.596
His body's still warm.

31:37.629 --> 31:40.432
He hasn't been dead
all that long.

31:50.076 --> 31:52.178
All right, Emerson.

31:52.211 --> 31:54.513
Listen, all your stuff is
back where you left it.

31:54.546 --> 31:56.182
- You're going home.
- Yeah.

31:56.215 --> 31:57.516
No place like home.

31:57.549 --> 31:59.118
Click, click, click.

31:59.151 --> 32:00.419
Three times.

32:00.452 --> 32:02.454
No place is a good place.

32:05.224 --> 32:07.059
He held out.

32:09.595 --> 32:11.998
Take a look.

32:12.031 --> 32:13.932
Contents of our 26 boxes.

32:15.167 --> 32:17.003
Exothermic Cutting
System?

32:17.036 --> 32:20.472
They're gonna try and cut their
way into the Union Parcel vault.

32:20.506 --> 32:22.408
Wait a second-- where are
the tracking numbers?

32:22.441 --> 32:24.076
In a warehouse
full of stuff,

32:24.110 --> 32:25.044
without them,
you'd be lost.

32:26.278 --> 32:29.248
He came into the FBI
trying to work an angle

32:29.281 --> 32:30.716
to spring Emerson.

32:30.749 --> 32:32.051
It wasn't Emerson
he cared about.

32:32.084 --> 32:34.053
It was the tracking numbers.

32:34.086 --> 32:35.321
And there's only

32:35.354 --> 32:37.589
one person who has them,
safely inside his head.

32:37.623 --> 32:39.091
I need to take the stairs.

32:39.125 --> 32:40.126
Yeah, no, we
know that.

32:40.159 --> 32:41.293
Don't worry
about it.

32:41.327 --> 32:43.329
39 steps, there are 39 steps.

32:43.362 --> 32:45.131
There are 39
saltines

32:45.164 --> 32:46.565
in a sleeve
of crackers,

32:46.598 --> 32:49.068
39 Supreme Court Justices.

32:49.101 --> 32:50.102
Hold on, Emerson.

32:50.136 --> 32:51.437
I don't think it's 39.

32:51.470 --> 32:53.039
I believe the number's nine.

32:53.072 --> 32:55.074
Joke.

32:55.107 --> 32:56.108
Ah.

32:56.142 --> 32:57.343
Right.

32:57.376 --> 32:58.777
CHARLIE: All right, tell us
another one.

32:58.810 --> 33:00.746
EMERSON: No, no more jokes
today.

33:03.149 --> 33:05.017
They're on their way up.

33:06.152 --> 33:08.120
(cocks gun)

33:08.154 --> 33:10.056
No witnesses.

33:25.204 --> 33:27.339
- No! No! No! No! No! No!
- What's wrong, buddy?

33:27.373 --> 33:29.675
The mat is wrong! No.
The mat is wrong.

33:29.708 --> 33:30.642
Somebody probably
just moved it, okay?

33:30.676 --> 33:32.278
- No! No! No!
- Here, I'm putting it back.

33:32.311 --> 33:33.712
Too-too many feet.

33:33.745 --> 33:35.181
Big feet! Small feet live here!

33:35.214 --> 33:37.449
Only small feet!

33:37.483 --> 33:39.151
(cocks gun)
Hey, you guys, get inside!

33:39.185 --> 33:39.618
Move! Move!

33:39.651 --> 33:41.387
(rapid gunfire)

33:43.089 --> 33:43.789
(shotgun blasts)

33:47.793 --> 33:49.095
You, you head toward the closet.

33:49.128 --> 33:49.828
No!

33:49.861 --> 33:50.729
Head toward the
closet, Emerson.

33:50.762 --> 33:52.264
Stay down. Down.

33:52.298 --> 33:53.299
No! You over here.

33:53.332 --> 33:54.366
What?

33:58.470 --> 33:59.605
Hey, I want you
to be in here.

33:59.638 --> 34:00.806
- You be quiet, all right?
- Yeah.

34:00.839 --> 34:02.174
Don't move till I
come back, all right?

34:02.208 --> 34:03.242
Don't move.
Moving's not allowed.

34:03.275 --> 34:04.410
All right.

34:04.443 --> 34:05.411
(door shuts)

34:05.444 --> 34:07.246
FBI training course.

34:07.279 --> 34:08.380
Did you really shoot high score?

34:08.414 --> 34:09.815
290 out of 300.

34:09.848 --> 34:11.283
All right, it's a lot different

34:11.317 --> 34:12.218
when they're shooting back
at you, okay?

34:12.251 --> 34:13.219
- No.
- Move back.

34:13.252 --> 34:14.386
- Take it, Charlie.
- Take it.

34:14.420 --> 34:15.387
All right.

34:15.421 --> 34:16.588
(shotgun blasting)

34:22.794 --> 34:24.430
(automatic gun firing)

34:25.897 --> 34:27.333
You stay with me,
we're about to move.

34:27.366 --> 34:28.267
Stay with me, okay?

34:29.235 --> 34:30.169
(two gunshots)

34:56.362 --> 34:57.463
(whispering):
Kitchen.

34:58.530 --> 34:59.198
Hey, I got an idea.

34:59.931 --> 35:02.134
Just... back me up, you know.

35:02.168 --> 35:02.868
All right.

35:07.273 --> 35:08.540
(yells)

35:10.542 --> 35:11.343
- Get him?
- Got him.

35:11.377 --> 35:12.478
(gasps)
Shh!

35:12.511 --> 35:13.612
- Follow me.
- Okay.

35:22.221 --> 35:24.356
Drop your guns.

35:24.390 --> 35:25.891
Where's Rain Man?

35:25.924 --> 35:27.426
I sent him down the fire escape.

35:27.459 --> 35:28.727
Backup unit
has him by now.

35:28.760 --> 35:30.562
Backup unit, right.

35:30.596 --> 35:32.531
I like that.

35:32.564 --> 35:34.166
(cocks gun)
Me, too.

35:34.200 --> 35:35.167
Give me a reason.

35:38.570 --> 35:39.371
Next time,

35:39.405 --> 35:41.173
you really should call
for backup.

35:41.207 --> 35:42.408
We were a little busy.

35:42.441 --> 35:43.275
You okay?

35:43.309 --> 35:45.411
Uh, yeah.

35:45.444 --> 35:47.446
I will wait till I get home
to throw up.

35:47.479 --> 35:48.880
Exploding Cheez Whiz.

35:48.914 --> 35:50.416
Good work, Charlie.

35:50.449 --> 35:52.451
I felt like Butch Cassidy
and Mr. Wizard.

35:52.484 --> 35:53.419
Hey, where's Emerson?

35:53.452 --> 35:54.420
Safe. He's in the closet.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.229
What the... ?

36:05.497 --> 36:08.367
(low, steady humming)

36:15.541 --> 36:16.975
(humming mimicking
roaring race cars)

36:17.008 --> 36:18.477
(TV race car announcer
speaking indistinctly)

36:18.510 --> 36:19.945
ANNOUNCER:
...Turn two and downside

36:19.978 --> 36:22.414
the back straight....

36:24.616 --> 36:27.586
Not looking so good, tough guy.

36:27.619 --> 36:28.954
A murdered FBI agent,

36:28.987 --> 36:30.856
you're a dead man
walking.

36:30.889 --> 36:32.558
You got one shot
to dodge a needle.

36:34.826 --> 36:36.595
I'm listening.

36:36.628 --> 36:38.464
We know your boss
is planning to bust

36:38.497 --> 36:40.466
into the Union Parcel
vault to steal the gold.

36:40.499 --> 36:42.801
He sent the tools
he needs in 26 boxes.

36:42.834 --> 36:44.636
Your boss needs
tracking numbers.

36:45.704 --> 36:47.439
We put together a list
of our own.

36:47.473 --> 36:48.507
You're gonna give it to him.

36:52.878 --> 36:54.280
Numbers match.

36:54.313 --> 36:55.247
That's all of them.

37:09.295 --> 37:10.496
DON: Turn around, I gotta take a
look at your face.

37:11.730 --> 37:12.664
FBI!

37:12.698 --> 37:15.467
(federal agents shouting)

37:16.635 --> 37:19.571
Good behavior,
I'm out in three.

37:19.605 --> 37:20.606
Your boy, Ricci,
gave you up.

37:20.639 --> 37:22.774
We've got you for the murder
of a federal agent

37:22.808 --> 37:24.310
Carter Laidlaw.

37:24.343 --> 37:25.477
Not to mention attempted murder

37:25.511 --> 37:27.045
of another agent
and a federal witness.

37:27.078 --> 37:28.680
And my brother.
Don't forget him.

37:28.714 --> 37:30.382
Let's go.

37:30.416 --> 37:31.817
You can say hello to death row.

37:37.956 --> 37:39.791
*

37:39.825 --> 37:41.960
* So be patient

37:41.993 --> 37:43.729
* Patient

37:43.762 --> 37:47.733
* When waiting for the gold...

37:47.766 --> 37:49.668
It's decaf.

37:53.372 --> 37:54.906
Well, you're probably right,

37:54.940 --> 37:57.008
I shouldn't have stopped
therapy.

37:57.042 --> 37:59.711
We don't need the four walls
and a couch.

38:03.014 --> 38:05.016
It's this agent
that I lost...

38:05.050 --> 38:06.652
You've lost people before.

38:06.685 --> 38:08.086
He had this picture
of his family

38:08.119 --> 38:09.488
and he was reaching out for it.

38:11.022 --> 38:12.991
I mean, that's what he wanted.

38:13.024 --> 38:14.660
Just something to hold on to.

38:14.693 --> 38:16.395
To believe in.

38:16.428 --> 38:18.664
You have family, friends,

38:18.697 --> 38:23.602
a stable relationship
with a hot prosecutor--

38:23.635 --> 38:25.637
they don't count
for anything?

38:25.671 --> 38:27.673
No, they do, that's
the thing though.

38:27.706 --> 38:29.441
I-I-I need more.

38:29.475 --> 38:30.809
Really.

38:30.842 --> 38:32.511
I don't know
what I would reach out for.

38:32.544 --> 38:35.614
(sighs)

38:35.647 --> 38:41.453
As a shrink, I want
to tell you to look within.

38:41.487 --> 38:44.523
But as a man,
I have to be honest.

38:44.556 --> 38:46.692
I think what you're
really looking for,

38:46.725 --> 38:49.094
you won't be able to find
on a couch.

38:49.127 --> 38:54.700
* 'Cause I'm on my way
back home... *

38:54.733 --> 38:56.768
I guess you're sick
of this place, huh?

38:56.802 --> 38:58.404
I've had enough.

38:58.437 --> 39:00.105
Eight is enough to fill
the world with love.

39:00.138 --> 39:01.473
I don't love this place.

39:01.507 --> 39:03.108
I've had enough.

39:03.141 --> 39:04.476
I hear that.

39:04.510 --> 39:06.745
Emerson, I got you
a going-away present.

39:08.179 --> 39:10.115
Yeah, I can see myself.

39:10.148 --> 39:12.818
It's a, uh, key for
a storage unit.

39:12.851 --> 39:14.152
- All right?
- I rented it

39:14.185 --> 39:16.087
for you for about a month.
Give it a try.

39:16.121 --> 39:18.590
It might be an easier way for
you to store all your stuff.

39:18.624 --> 39:20.058
No keys, I lose keys.

39:20.091 --> 39:21.092
Keys are losers.

39:21.126 --> 39:22.528
Alan Keyes, candidate

39:22.561 --> 39:23.662
for president
three times,

39:23.695 --> 39:25.697
lost every time.
No keys.

39:25.731 --> 39:26.898
Keys are losers.

39:26.932 --> 39:28.667
- It was just a thought.
- Yeah.

39:28.700 --> 39:29.601
Ready to go?

39:29.635 --> 39:31.470
Ready. Ready. Buckle up.
Safety first.

39:31.503 --> 39:32.871
I've got the saltines

39:32.904 --> 39:34.840
and the Cheez Whiz, but
I forgot the olives.

39:34.873 --> 39:35.974
Gotta have olives.

39:36.007 --> 39:37.142
Gotta have the olives on top.

39:37.175 --> 39:38.610
Mount of Olives.
150 calories.

39:38.644 --> 39:40.011
Even if he's in good
hands, I know

39:40.045 --> 39:41.747
it's not easy for a guy
used to having

39:41.780 --> 39:43.649
all the answers, huh?
(elevator bell dings)

39:43.682 --> 39:45.150
156 olives on top.

39:45.183 --> 39:46.418
Up and down.

39:46.452 --> 39:47.686
- We'll get some.
- Hi.

39:47.719 --> 39:48.720
Hi, Amita.

39:48.754 --> 39:52.791
Best answer I've found yet.

39:52.824 --> 39:59.030
* Oh, the sound is breaking
all my bones *

39:59.064 --> 40:04.035
* And won't you sing again

40:04.069 --> 40:05.804
* About it

40:05.837 --> 40:09.675
* The fire of my life

40:09.708 --> 40:13.479
* Is knocking at my front door

40:13.512 --> 40:20.719
* And won't you
let him in this time? *

40:20.752 --> 40:26.725
* And won't you let him in
this time? *

40:33.565 --> 40:34.500
(song ends)
