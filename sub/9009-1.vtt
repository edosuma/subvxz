<b>02 Damien Omen II - Horror 1978
[H246-mp4] Subtitles English.</b>

02:04.791 --> 02:07.960
- Michael.
- Carl.

02:08.044 --> 02:10.211
Michael, have you seen this?

02:12.465 --> 02:14.716
What?

02:14.801 --> 02:16.718
- Do you recognize him?
- No.

02:18.054 --> 02:20.389
Haven't you seen
Yigael's Wall yet?

02:20.473 --> 02:22.850
It was only opened up last week.

02:22.934 --> 02:27.521
There are four faces of the
Antichrist on his rise to power.

02:27.605 --> 02:30.858
The face ofYigael's Satan
as a child is the same.

02:30.942 --> 02:33.944
- The same? What are you talking about?
- There is no doubt.

02:34.028 --> 02:37.990
Damien Thorn is the Antichrist.

02:38.074 --> 02:40.484
Oh, Carl.

02:40.569 --> 02:42.142
Michael, you must believe me.

02:42.143 --> 02:45.289
Carl, I'm an archaeologist,
not a religious fanatic.

02:45.373 --> 02:49.585
Even now, already is he in the world,
and his power shall be mighty...

02:49.669 --> 02:52.546
and he shall prosper
and practice...

02:52.630 --> 02:55.424
and shall destroy the
mighty and the holy.

02:55.508 --> 02:58.802
I appreciate the sermon, Carl,
but what possible facts-.

02:58.887 --> 03:04.099
His own father knew. A week
ago he tried to destroy him.

03:05.768 --> 03:10.230
That's a minor detail these
newspapers seem to have omitted.

03:10.315 --> 03:13.317
I gave him the daggers myself.

03:15.069 --> 03:19.615
He's in Chicago living
with his father's brother.

03:19.699 --> 03:24.369
Now, you must take this and
give it to his new parents.

03:24.454 --> 03:28.207
- What is it?
- There is a letter inside explaining everything.

03:28.291 --> 03:32.252
- Look, Carl, you can hardly expect
me- - They have to be warned!

03:32.337 --> 03:35.088
I'm too old. I'm too
ill. I can't go myself.

03:35.173 --> 03:39.301
And I am the only living
person who knows the truth.

03:39.385 --> 03:43.180
But, Carl, I've got a
reputation to maintain.

03:43.264 --> 03:46.433
That is why it has to be you.
They will listen to you.

03:46.517 --> 03:48.602
And then have me committed. No.

03:48.686 --> 03:52.522
Look, Carl, we're old friends. I
think we understand one another.

03:52.607 --> 03:56.568
<i>- You can't expect me to believe
that-</i> - Then come to Yigael's Wall!

03:56.653 --> 03:59.488
- What, now?
- Now!

04:31.145 --> 04:33.063
Here, Michael.

04:33.147 --> 04:38.735
Carl Bugenhagen, I hope this guarantees
me a place in the kingdom of heaven.

06:07.784 --> 06:10.952
<i>Michael, you'll be
needing your torch now.</i>

06:31.682 --> 06:33.892
It's the Whore of Babylon.

06:33.976 --> 06:35.977
This is priceless!

06:51.994 --> 06:54.830
Michael.

06:56.124 --> 06:59.501
<i>Michael, come here.</i>

07:05.174 --> 07:08.969
Look.

07:09.053 --> 07:11.012
It is him.

07:23.067 --> 07:26.361
- [ Michael ] Is there another way out?
- No.

07:55.475 --> 07:58.143
Carl?

07:58.227 --> 08:01.021
The Antichrist is with us!

08:11.782 --> 08:14.743
Carl, we've got to get out!

08:14.827 --> 08:16.745
Help me, will you?

08:18.664 --> 08:22.751
Carl... help! Don't stop!

08:22.835 --> 08:24.835
Michael!

08:45.233 --> 08:47.651
Forces of evil...

08:47.735 --> 08:52.280
may seem to overwhelm
us and be triumphant...

08:52.365 --> 08:54.533
but goodness will prevail...

08:54.617 --> 08:57.661
<i>for it is written in the
Book of Revelation:</i>

08:57.745 --> 09:00.372
"Then shall that
wicked be revealed...

09:00.456 --> 09:05.001
"whom the Lord shall consume
with the spirit of his mouth...

09:05.086 --> 09:09.798
and destroy with the
brightness of his coming."

09:36.242 --> 09:40.036
<i>- [ Boy ] Damien!</i>
- I'm coming.

09:49.839 --> 09:51.798
I'll see you next summer, Jim.

09:51.882 --> 09:54.134
- Say good-bye to your cousin for me, Damien.
- I will.

09:54.218 --> 09:56.177
<i>- Bye-bye.</i>
- Bye-bye.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.853
- Come on!
<i>- Coming.</i>

10:11.277 --> 10:14.195
- Did you find him yet?
<i>- Yeah, he's coming.</i>

10:22.447 --> 10:25.734
Good-bye, Aunt Marion. It
was nice seeing you again.

10:25.735 --> 10:26.750
Who told you?

10:26.834 --> 10:28.752
Told me what?

10:28.836 --> 10:31.671
Politeness isn't one of
your strong points, Damien.

10:31.756 --> 10:35.634
<i>I'm sure you didn't come here to say
good-bye to me on your own initiative.</i>

10:35.718 --> 10:38.219
I didn't know you were in
here, but I was going to.

10:38.304 --> 10:40.513
Were you really?

10:40.598 --> 10:43.350
Good-bye, Aunt Marion.

10:53.152 --> 10:55.153
- All set?
- We think so.

10:55.237 --> 10:57.906
- I'll be right back.
- Let's go.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.998
Now, you boys have
your allowance...

11:07.083 --> 11:12.879
so this is just a little something
extra... in case of an emergency.

11:16.926 --> 11:19.552
Hold it. Did you say
good-bye to Aunt Marion?

11:19.637 --> 11:21.763
I did.

11:24.600 --> 11:27.477
<i>Aunt Marion?</i>

11:27.561 --> 11:30.522
Oh, Mark, I haven't
seen enough of you.

11:30.606 --> 11:34.609
- You should've come to my room so we could talk.
- I'm sorry, Aunt Marion.

11:34.694 --> 11:38.196
I know you've been so busy running
after that cousin of yours.

11:38.280 --> 11:41.157
You mustn't let him drag you
around the way he does.

11:41.242 --> 11:43.451
He doesn't drag me
around. I like him.

11:45.496 --> 11:48.540
Give me a hug.

11:48.624 --> 11:51.751
You be careful.

11:51.836 --> 11:54.421
Yes, Aunt Marion. Good-bye.

11:58.342 --> 12:01.469
Just a second! [ Laughs ]

12:01.554 --> 12:04.097
Good-bye, Dad.

12:04.181 --> 12:08.768
Did you forget me? Are you
sure? Here, sweetheart.

12:08.853 --> 12:12.480
- Take some biscuits. Have a good week.
- Bye.

12:23.325 --> 12:26.661
- She's too much, Aunt Marion.
- She's awful! Why did they invite her?

12:26.746 --> 12:30.498
So she could wag her finger, criticize
us, generally ruin our weekend.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.876
- At least we don't have to have dinner with her.
- Right.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.920
- God, what's that smell?
- Lavender, you fool.

12:36.005 --> 12:38.840
All old ladies douse themselves
in it. Don't know why.

12:38.924 --> 12:40.842
<i>Boys, just because the
woman's getting on-.</i>

12:40.926 --> 12:42.032
On our nerves!

12:42.033 --> 12:46.181
Come on. Murray's right. Let's
hear it for Aunt Marion.

12:46.265 --> 12:48.600
[ Together Mockingly ] Hooray.

12:48.684 --> 12:52.270
- Murray, give us a cigarette.
- You know the answer to that one.

12:52.354 --> 12:55.940
- You don't ask, you never know.
- Have you boys met your new platoon leader yet?

12:56.025 --> 12:58.359
- Neff?
- Neff for "neffer-mind."

12:58.444 --> 13:00.987
- Oh, geez!
- Come on, they're all the same.

13:01.071 --> 13:03.573
When you've met one platoon
leader, you've met them all.

13:03.657 --> 13:07.160
Attention! Eyes front!
Chest out, stomach in!

13:07.244 --> 13:09.245
You know something?
You're crazy.

13:09.330 --> 13:11.873
- Yeah, 'cause I've practised.
- Oh, God.

13:16.128 --> 13:19.088
Would you like some
cream, Aunt Marion?

13:19.173 --> 13:22.592
You've asked me that six
times since I've come here.

13:22.676 --> 13:24.636
I'm sorry, I forgot.

13:24.720 --> 13:27.514
You haven't forgotten.
You just don't care.

13:27.598 --> 13:30.266
Marion, let's don't get
into that argument again.

13:30.351 --> 13:32.894
- No cream.
- No cream.

13:32.978 --> 13:35.980
Charles is going to show us some
slides after we've finished here...

13:36.065 --> 13:38.858
so why don't you tell us
why you've come, Marion.

13:40.110 --> 13:42.821
I own 27% of Thorn industries...

13:42.905 --> 13:44.823
left to me by your father.

13:44.907 --> 13:49.035
And I have every right to dispose of
my share in any way that I see fit.

13:49.119 --> 13:52.413
- We know that.
<i>- You also know...</i>

13:52.498 --> 13:56.501
that at the moment, I've left
everything to you, Richard.

13:56.585 --> 13:59.128
But I've come here to tell you,
that unless you do what I ask...

13:59.213 --> 14:02.632
Marion, don't threaten me. Because
as far as I'm concerned-.

14:02.716 --> 14:06.302
You can't be unconcerned about a sum that
is close to a hundred million dollars!

14:06.387 --> 14:09.188
- L don't see that I should be here.
- You're here, Dr. Warren...

14:09.273 --> 14:13.894
because you're curator of the Thorn
Museum and I also own 27% of that!

14:13.978 --> 14:16.488
Marion, say what you've
got to say, because

14:16.489 --> 14:18.998
if it's unpleasant,
let's get it over with.

14:19.083 --> 14:21.901
I want you to take the
boys out of the academy.

14:21.986 --> 14:24.195
I want you to send them
to separate schools.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.231
Well, now.

14:25.232 --> 14:29.033
I don't care what you want
where the boys are concerned.

14:29.118 --> 14:33.538
<i>- They're not your sons. They're ours.</i>
- Neither boy is yours.

14:33.622 --> 14:37.876
<i>May I remind you that Mark is
Richard's son by his first wife.</i>

14:37.960 --> 14:41.921
- And Damien is his brother's son.
- Thank you.

14:42.006 --> 14:45.216
- Thank you very much!
- Ann, please.

14:45.301 --> 14:48.052
<i>Marion, just what the
hell is this all about?</i>

14:48.137 --> 14:52.181
Get Mark away from Damien!
They don't belong together.

14:52.266 --> 14:55.560
- Damien's a terrible influence. Can't you see that?
- What?

14:55.644 --> 14:58.730
That's it. As far as I'm
concerned, the dinner's over.

14:58.814 --> 15:00.899
Our conversation is over,
and I suggest that...

15:00.983 --> 15:03.735
Richard, you're blind!
Purposely blind!

15:03.819 --> 15:06.070
You know your brother
tried to kill Damien.

15:06.155 --> 15:07.831
Get out!

15:07.915 --> 15:10.241
<i>- Richard, make her get out.</i>
- Why did he try to kill him?

15:10.326 --> 15:12.711
<i>- Answer me! Tell the truth!
- Marion, he was ill!</i>

15:12.795 --> 15:15.246
- You know that!
- You don't have to explain anything to her.

15:15.331 --> 15:18.683
If you don't separate those two boys, I'm
going to leave everything to charity.

15:18.768 --> 15:21.586
I don't care what you do with the
money. You can burn it, give it away!

15:21.670 --> 15:25.256
Richard, please listen to me! You
know what I'm saying is true!

15:25.341 --> 15:27.383
I may be old, but
I'm not insane!

15:27.468 --> 15:29.594
Your brother tried
to kill Damien.

15:29.678 --> 15:32.221
Get out! Will you
tell her to go?

15:32.306 --> 15:34.849
I'm going.

15:38.604 --> 15:41.648
I'm sorry, Charles. I
apologize for her.

15:41.732 --> 15:46.402
<i>- She's old and not well.</i>
- No, that's all right. I understand.

15:46.487 --> 15:48.529
I should've noticed
before dinner that-.

15:48.614 --> 15:53.368
<i>Richard, please. I assure you, think
nothing of it. I'll go set up the slides.</i>

15:57.623 --> 15:59.624
- I want her out of here in the morning.
- Ann.

15:59.708 --> 16:02.526
- I don't want her in this house anymore.
- The poor woman is senile.

16:02.527 --> 16:04.520
That poor woman is dangerous.

16:04.588 --> 16:06.873
She pollutes the air with her
craziness! She sickens me!

16:06.874 --> 16:09.918
And she frightens the boys. They can't
stand to be in the same room with her.

16:09.919 --> 16:12.421
All right, she goes first thing
in the morning. Now, calm down.

16:12.471 --> 16:14.597
- Why does she hate Damien?
- L don't know.

16:14.682 --> 16:18.726
She hates him so much! It's not just
me and the boys she has to leave for.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.562
She starts something in
you. Something strange.

16:21.647 --> 16:24.023
All right, it's over. It's done.

16:29.405 --> 16:32.240
Come on, let's
join Charles, huh?

16:53.846 --> 16:57.140

<i>We should be getting the first
shipment in about three weeks.</i>

would interest you.

- Oh, dear.
<i>- She is a bit frightening, isn't she?</i>

<i>She represents Rome.</i>

17:23.166 --> 17:27.086

kings who have no kingdoms yet...</i>

there. The Spoiler.

The Desolate One.

17:38.223 --> 17:42.226
- Why is she riding him?
<i>- I don't know, but it wasn't to be for long.</i>

17:42.311 --> 17:46.606
<i>According to the Book of Revelation,
the 10 kings shall hate the whore...</i>

17:46.690 --> 17:48.566
and make her desolate and naked.

17:48.650 --> 17:51.444
<i>Shall eat her flesh and
burn her with fire.</i>

Hmm. It's not very nice.

20:42.950 --> 20:46.327
This is Sergeant Daniel Neff.
He'll be taking over...

20:46.411 --> 20:49.163
<i>as platoon officer from
Sergeant Goodrich.</i>

20:49.248 --> 20:52.041
<i>Sergeant Neff is a very
experienced soldier...</i>

20:52.125 --> 20:54.043
<i>and I'm sure that
within a few weeks...</i>

20:54.127 --> 20:58.422
<i>you will be the snappiest
platoon in the entire academy.</i>

20:58.507 --> 21:01.384
I'll leave any further
introductions to the sergeant.

21:11.186 --> 21:13.980
You'll speak to me only
when you're spoken to.

21:14.064 --> 21:16.274
And you'll listen to
every word I say.

21:16.358 --> 21:21.237
Because I intend to
shine in my new job.

21:21.321 --> 21:25.408
And the only way I can shine
is by making you shine.

21:25.492 --> 21:28.744
You're the little unit
that I have to polish...

21:28.829 --> 21:31.831
until the glare of
your achievements...

21:31.915 --> 21:34.709
blinds everybody on
this parade ground.

21:35.752 --> 21:38.004
- Am I understood?
- Yes, sir!

21:39.840 --> 21:43.217
I'll meet each of you personally
in my office after breakfast.

21:43.302 --> 21:46.345
For now, your names.

21:46.430 --> 21:49.348
- Mark Thorn, Sergeant.
- Thorn?

21:49.433 --> 21:52.727
Your family's got strong connections
with this place, hasn't it?

21:52.811 --> 21:56.564
- Well, hasn't it?
- My father and grandfather were cadets here, sir.

21:56.648 --> 22:00.693
Good. But that doesn't entitle you to
privileges. We're all the same here.

22:03.864 --> 22:07.700
- Yours.
- Damien Thorn, Sergeant.

22:08.869 --> 22:11.454
- You don't look alike.
- Cousins, Sergeant.

22:13.707 --> 22:17.793
All right. But understand the
same thing goes for you.

22:17.878 --> 22:20.046
Your name.

22:49.951 --> 22:52.870
- Good morning, Bill.
- Well, Richard!

22:52.954 --> 22:57.541
By the way, there's something
I wanna talk over with you.

22:57.626 --> 23:01.545
I'm the first to admit that Paul's
difficult to get along with.

23:01.630 --> 23:04.715
But it took us three years to find
a man with his qualifications.

23:04.800 --> 23:10.346
I'm not questioning his
qualifications. It's... His manner.

23:10.430 --> 23:14.892
I can even cope with his manner.
I've met and dealt with every kind.

23:14.976 --> 23:18.187
No, I don't like
what he's proposing.

23:18.271 --> 23:22.817
It sticks in my craw, and I don't
intend to hide my feelings.

23:22.901 --> 23:26.404
You worried that it could get us in
trouble with the Justice Department?

23:26.488 --> 23:30.074
He's dealing with
highly emotive stuff.

23:30.158 --> 23:33.619
Bill, let's hear him out.

23:33.703 --> 23:37.540
The only thing I ask is that
you couch your objections...

23:37.624 --> 23:41.210
with a little more
delicacy than usual.

23:46.925 --> 23:49.552
Jennie, is Miss
Marion dressed yet?

23:49.636 --> 23:51.554
I don't think she's
awake yet, Mrs. Thorn.

23:51.638 --> 23:54.515
- I knocked earlier, but she didn't answer.
- Thank you.

23:59.354 --> 24:02.857
<i>Aunt Marion, you'll
miss your plane.</i>

24:20.542 --> 24:22.960
[ Bill ] No matter how
you slice it, Paul...

24:23.044 --> 24:26.046
what you're saying is that we should
give up our leadership in electronics.

24:26.131 --> 24:28.716
Bill, you're wrong. My report
points to the indisputable fact...

24:28.800 --> 24:31.844
that Thorn Industries' main interest
is in energy and electronics.

24:31.928 --> 24:34.430
What I'm maintaining is that
because of this bias...

24:34.514 --> 24:36.345
we tend to ignore
what's going on here at

24:36.346 --> 24:38.350
this plant, and we ignore
it at our own risk.

24:38.435 --> 24:42.855
Our profitable future, aside from
energy, lies also in famine.

24:42.939 --> 24:47.009
What? That statement is typical
of you. It's heartless and-.

24:47.010 --> 24:48.027
True.

24:48.111 --> 24:50.070
Not heartless, realistic.

24:50.155 --> 24:52.740
Pasarian, hold it here.

24:53.909 --> 24:56.160
Are these solutions designated?

24:56.244 --> 25:00.456
No, not yet. Each tank has a
different fertilizer and pesticide.

25:00.540 --> 25:04.668
They won't be designated until we pump
it into the experimental crop beds.

25:04.753 --> 25:07.004
All right, let's go on.

25:07.088 --> 25:10.591
[ Paul ] One person dies of
starvation every 8.6 seconds.

25:10.675 --> 25:15.971
Seven every minute. Four hundred twenty
every hour. Ten thousand every day.

25:16.056 --> 25:18.766
To feed these people, we
have to farm the ocean.

25:18.850 --> 25:23.062
We have to develop new strains of high
yield, disease-resistant grain crops.

25:23.146 --> 25:26.857
The oil countries didn't hesitate to
put their fingers on our jugular vein.

25:26.942 --> 25:28.901
So, what's so
different about food?

25:28.985 --> 25:32.488
If you've got a knife at your belly,
you'll keep your hands at your sides.

25:32.572 --> 25:34.698
Why then call my
policy unethical?

25:34.783 --> 25:38.327
It's callous and inhuman,
and in my opinion illegal.

25:38.411 --> 25:40.955
What is inhuman or illegal
about feeding people?

25:41.039 --> 25:43.165
- Telephone, Mr. Thorn.
- I'm not available.

25:43.250 --> 25:45.793
It's an emergency, sir.

25:47.629 --> 25:50.756
Bill's point is if we control
the food people eat...

25:50.840 --> 25:52.800
it's tantamount to
making slaves of them.

25:52.884 --> 25:56.679
- Ah, customers!
- But you want us to buy up their land.

25:56.763 --> 25:59.298
That's right. Thorns already have
the hardware and knowledge...

25:59.299 --> 26:01.062
that's easily adaptable
to the purpose of

26:01.063 --> 26:02.993
large-scale and highly
sophisticated farming.

26:03.061 --> 26:06.313
<i>This together with the pesticides
and fertilizers we're producing...</i>

26:06.398 --> 26:09.525
give us the jump on any governmental
or corporate entity in the world.

26:09.609 --> 26:13.028
If we control their land,
we make them tenants.

26:13.113 --> 26:15.531
Bill, we make their
bellies full.

26:15.615 --> 26:17.616
I have to agree with Paul.

26:17.701 --> 26:20.661
I'll be right back.

26:23.582 --> 26:27.418
Marion died in her sleep last
night, a coronary. I'm sorry.

26:27.502 --> 26:30.621
I've got to go. I'll
talk to you later, Bill.

26:30.706 --> 26:34.248
Paul, how about breakfast at
the office in the morning?

26:34.249 --> 26:35.133
Certainly.

26:36.177 --> 26:38.262
<i>[ Bill ] Have they moved
into the apartment yet?</i>

26:38.346 --> 26:40.389
Today.

26:41.850 --> 26:43.809
Winter is here again.

26:43.893 --> 26:46.687
That's Damien's father
right there in the back.

26:46.771 --> 26:49.565
My old man played on that
team too. That's him.

26:49.649 --> 26:52.943
He was on the line, but
Robert Thorn was quarterback.

26:53.028 --> 26:55.613
Even back then he was calling
the plays for everybody.

26:55.697 --> 26:57.781
- You're next, Damien.
- Hey, Teddy.

26:57.866 --> 27:02.703
Don't ever talk about my father
again. Do you understand?

27:02.787 --> 27:06.340
- Can't you take a joke?
- Yeah.

27:09.586 --> 27:11.297
What was that all about?

27:11.298 --> 27:15.049
Your cousin really thinks
he's somebody, doesn't he?

27:15.133 --> 27:18.135
My old man tells me the
Thorns make their own hats...

27:18.219 --> 27:21.680
because the stores don't sell 'em
large enough for their big heads.

27:27.604 --> 27:29.813
You're gonna regret that, Thorn.

27:29.898 --> 27:33.984
Mathematics, good. Science, very
good. Military history, fair.

27:34.069 --> 27:37.404
- Room for improvement.
- Yes, Sergeant.

27:37.489 --> 27:41.325
Physical training is excellent. I
hear you're quite a football player.

27:41.409 --> 27:43.410
Be proud of your
accomplishments.

27:43.495 --> 27:46.372
Pride's all right when
there's reason to be proud.

27:46.456 --> 27:48.916
<i>Yes, Sergeant.</i>

27:49.000 --> 27:52.294
I'm here to teach you, but
also I'm here to help you.

27:52.379 --> 27:54.755
Any problems, you come to me.

27:54.839 --> 27:57.549
Don't be afraid. Day or night.

27:57.634 --> 27:59.802
Any advice. You understand?

27:59.886 --> 28:01.929
Whatever you say, Sergeant.

28:02.013 --> 28:04.431
We're gonna get to
know each other.

28:04.516 --> 28:06.517
I see you're an orphan.

28:06.601 --> 28:09.603
That's something
we have in common.

28:09.688 --> 28:12.147
Send Foster in.

28:16.861 --> 28:19.530
What's the matter, Thorn, don't
you like it on your back?

28:19.614 --> 28:21.949
Teddy.

28:23.076 --> 28:24.993
Another Thorn.

28:49.018 --> 28:51.103
<i>Stop!</i>

28:51.187 --> 28:53.439
No! [ Grunting ]

28:57.402 --> 29:01.155
What the hell are we
waiting for? Foster?

29:01.239 --> 29:04.408
- Yes, sir.
- You two, you finished? Out!

29:06.828 --> 29:09.371
<i>What are you doing?
Polishing the floor?</i>

29:19.174 --> 29:21.467
What did you do to him?

29:21.551 --> 29:26.513
I don't know.

29:31.227 --> 29:35.022
Come on. Once around the field.
I'll give you a head start.

29:47.869 --> 29:50.621
When do you plan to
open the exhibit?

29:50.705 --> 29:55.417
A lot depends on when we get the
last of the crates from abroad.

29:55.502 --> 29:57.711
- I'd say around Easter.
- Oh, good.

30:02.675 --> 30:05.636
- Are you going to make Mark's birthday party?
- Mm-hmm.

30:05.720 --> 30:07.638
You know I will. Will
the lake be frozen?

30:07.722 --> 30:10.432
- Bring your skates.
- Great.

30:14.479 --> 30:18.482
<i>- [ Door Closes ]</i>
- I've made a decision concerning your report.

30:18.566 --> 30:21.401
- Let me ease your mind- - I've
come down on Bill Atherton's side.

30:21.486 --> 30:24.196
Yes.

30:24.280 --> 30:28.742
It might be premature for the company
to embark on such a radical program.

30:28.827 --> 30:31.537
I wouldn't want to risk
defusing it before its time.

30:31.621 --> 30:34.581
- We'll keep it on ice?
- Good.

30:40.213 --> 30:43.590
Richard, if you think
I've gone too far...

30:43.675 --> 30:46.593
if Bill's antagonism towards
me is going to continue...

30:46.678 --> 30:48.595
maybe I should step down,
leave the company.

30:48.680 --> 30:52.724
Forget it. Your time will come.

31:01.776 --> 31:03.777
Looks like it might
rain, Murray.

31:03.862 --> 31:05.779
- Could be, sir.
- Let's go.

31:05.864 --> 31:09.950
Mr. Thorn! I'm sorry to shout at you
like that. L didn't want to miss you.

31:10.034 --> 31:13.036
My name is Joan Hart. L believe
Charles Warren told you about me.

31:13.121 --> 31:15.038
- Yes, he did.
- I must talk to you.

31:15.123 --> 31:17.174
- I asked him to- - It's
absolutely freezing.

31:17.258 --> 31:19.376
- Couldn't we possibly sit in your car?
- Miss Hart-.

31:19.460 --> 31:22.479
- I know. You hardly ever talk to reporters.
- I'm on my way to the airport.

31:22.563 --> 31:24.590
Two minutes, that's all. Please.

31:24.674 --> 31:28.468
- L can't miss my plane.
- I'll come to the airport with you.

31:29.888 --> 31:33.140
All right. Get in.

31:45.778 --> 31:50.324
All right, Miss Hart, our time is
short. What would you like to know?

31:50.408 --> 31:52.659
Did you ever meet the
archaeologist, Carl Bugenhagen?

31:52.744 --> 31:55.495
No, I heard of him.

31:55.580 --> 31:59.917
- He was also an exorcist. Did you know that?
- No.

32:00.001 --> 32:04.796
His skeleton was found last week on your
dig at Hazor, close to Yigael's Wall.

32:04.881 --> 32:07.257
Seven years after
his disappearance.

32:07.342 --> 32:09.760
Another journalistic assumption.

32:09.844 --> 32:12.554
The skeleton has not been
verified as that of Bugenhagen.

32:12.639 --> 32:16.141
But it has! I've just
come from there.

32:16.225 --> 32:19.186
Your brother met him.
Did you know that?

32:19.270 --> 32:21.605
Where did you get
that information?

32:21.689 --> 32:24.650
A photographer that I used to
work with went with your brother.

32:24.734 --> 32:29.446
- He died there. He was decapitated.
- Murray, stop the car.

32:29.530 --> 32:32.449
<i>Your brother went to see Bugenhagen
the week before he died.</i>

32:32.533 --> 32:34.626
<i>A few days later Bugenhagen
himself disappeared.</i>

32:34.627 --> 32:35.370
Please get out.

32:35.371 --> 32:37.862
Do you know why your brother
went to see Bugenhagen?

32:37.863 --> 32:39.681
Don't make me throw
you out, Miss Hart.

32:39.832 --> 32:43.377
Please, you must listen. I've been
working on the story for years now!

32:43.461 --> 32:45.612
I think I've pieced
it together. I never

32:45.613 --> 32:48.131
believed in the prophecies
of the Bible before.

32:48.216 --> 32:51.635
I was never religious! But
now- You are in grave danger!

32:51.719 --> 32:53.553
Don't try to contact me again!

32:53.638 --> 32:57.849
Put your strength in Christ!
Only he can protect you!

32:57.934 --> 33:01.186
Oh, please, please! You
must listen to me!

33:01.270 --> 33:03.480
Please, please! You
must listen to me!

33:03.564 --> 33:08.110
Bugenhagen warned your
brother! Oh, God!

33:12.156 --> 33:16.660
And just last week we finally
uncovered Yigael's Wall.

33:16.744 --> 33:19.496
- Who is Yigael?
- Incredible person. Very mysterious.

33:19.580 --> 33:22.082
We're not really sure. He was
a monk, he was an exorcist.

33:22.166 --> 33:24.543
Apparently he lived
about the 13th century.

33:24.627 --> 33:28.588
The story goes that Satan
appeared in person to Yigael...

33:28.673 --> 33:31.341
who not unexpectedly,
went out of his mind.

33:31.426 --> 33:34.803
He also went into hiding, obsessed
with painting what he had seen.

33:34.887 --> 33:40.267
Incredible visions of the
Antichrist from birth to downfall.

33:40.351 --> 33:43.812
But the reason why I don't want you
to say anything to Richard is...

33:43.896 --> 33:46.565
- I want it to be a present.
- Good.

33:46.649 --> 33:49.401
I've got a surprise for you too.

33:49.485 --> 33:51.403
Your favourite piece.
So nobody misses it...

33:51.487 --> 33:53.780
we're gonna put it right in
the middle of gallery four.

33:53.865 --> 33:57.325
I think you should lean her up
against one of the back doors.

33:57.410 --> 33:58.952
<i>Charles.</i>

33:59.037 --> 34:01.572
- Joan, when did you get in?
- Last night.

34:01.656 --> 34:03.765
Excuse me. This is Joan
Hart, the young lady-.

34:03.850 --> 34:05.834
Who wanted to
interview my husband.

34:05.918 --> 34:08.045
- Yes, I did interview him.
- You did what?

34:08.129 --> 34:10.755
I couldn't take "no" for an answer.
It was too important to me.

34:10.840 --> 34:12.632
You must be very persuasive.

34:12.717 --> 34:15.302
He doesn't have a very high
opinion of reporters, does he?

34:17.764 --> 34:19.973
Excuse me. I have a call.

34:23.936 --> 34:28.315
Your husband is a little unfair on the
press. They were very kind to his brother.

34:28.399 --> 34:31.109
Were they? I never
knew his brother.

34:31.194 --> 34:34.029
That's right. You're Richard
Thorn's second wife.

34:34.112 --> 34:37.407
<i>Tell me about Damien.
What sort of a boy is he?</i>

34:37.492 --> 34:40.243
- Is he enjoying life at the Military Academy?
- Ann! Ann!

34:40.328 --> 34:42.913
Don't say another word! Richard
is absolutely furious!

34:42.996 --> 34:46.083
Charles, you are in
danger! All of you!

34:46.167 --> 34:48.251
- What's got into you?
- I've seen Yigael's Wall.

34:48.335 --> 34:51.254

- I know how it sounds.
- And you believe it!

01:20:33.286 --> 01:20:37.665
Read his letter yourself. I will not
read the ravings of a senile old man!

01:20:37.749 --> 01:20:40.251
Richard, I knew Bugenhagen.
He wasn't senile.

01:20:40.335 --> 01:20:44.171
If what he says is true, we are all in
great danger! You, Ann, Mark, all of us!

01:20:44.256 --> 01:20:46.173
- Haven't you noticed anything suspicious?
- No.

01:20:46.258 --> 01:20:48.342
- Something the boy has said or done?
- Nothing.

01:20:48.426 --> 01:20:51.013
There have been deaths among us.
Joan Hart, Atherton, Pasarian.

01:20:51.014 --> 01:20:51.679
Coincidental.

01:20:51.763 --> 01:20:53.981
- What about Aunt Marion?
- Aunt Marion was an old lady.

01:20:53.982 --> 01:20:55.658
- There's proof.
- What proof?

01:20:55.725 --> 01:20:57.881
Yigael's Wall! Bugenhagen
saw it. He says that

01:20:57.882 --> 01:20:59.854
that's the final thing
that convinced him.

01:20:59.938 --> 01:21:03.040
That's enough, Charles! I don't wanna
hear any more of your religious ranting!

01:21:03.041 --> 01:21:06.335
<i>- The wall arrives in New York tomorrow.</i>
- Then you go and look at it!

01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:10.781
I will.

01:23:43.351 --> 01:23:47.104
You can't believe this. Damien?

01:23:47.188 --> 01:23:50.149
I didn't say I believe it. I just
told you what he said to me.

01:23:50.233 --> 01:23:52.818
You're thinking of going to New
York. Doesn't that mean anything?

01:23:52.902 --> 01:23:55.738
It's damn nonsense!

01:23:55.822 --> 01:23:57.654
The only thing is that
Robert was shot in the

01:23:57.655 --> 01:23:59.366
church while he was
trying to stab Damien.

01:23:59.451 --> 01:24:03.495
He's gotten to you, hasn't he?

01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:06.206
He's gotten his craziness.

01:24:06.291 --> 01:24:09.376
I am not gonna let him poison
you. You're not going away.

01:24:09.461 --> 01:24:10.128
Ann.

01:24:10.129 --> 01:24:12.796
<i>You're gonna forget that
you've ever spoken to him.</i>

01:24:12.881 --> 01:24:15.424
It's over! It's over! It
is a filthy, stupid story!

01:24:15.508 --> 01:24:18.969
And it's over. Richard, stop
it. Stop it, please. God!

01:24:19.054 --> 01:24:20.971
All right, all
right. I won't go.

01:24:21.056 --> 01:24:22.912
You're not gonna treat
Damien any differently,

01:24:22.913 --> 01:24:24.808
not gonna look at him,
talk to him differently.

01:24:24.893 --> 01:24:26.810
- I won't. I promise.
- Give me your word.

01:24:26.895 --> 01:24:29.605
I promise.

01:24:37.238 --> 01:24:39.615
Look, we can both
use some air...

01:24:39.699 --> 01:24:43.243
so why don't you get into some clothes
and we'll go out and hunt up the kids.

01:25:26.663 --> 01:25:29.206
Mark?

01:25:53.982 --> 01:25:57.234
I know you're there.

01:26:19.632 --> 01:26:22.217
Why are you running
away from me, Mark?

01:26:22.302 --> 01:26:25.429
- I know who you are.
- You do?

01:26:25.513 --> 01:26:30.100
- Dr. Warren knows. I overheard him talking to Dad.
- What did he say?

01:26:30.185 --> 01:26:35.230
He said the devil could
create his image on Earth.

01:26:35.315 --> 01:26:37.566
The devil?

01:26:37.650 --> 01:26:40.360
What else did he say?

01:26:43.031 --> 01:26:45.199
Say it, Mark.

01:26:47.285 --> 01:26:49.203
He said you're the beast!

01:26:49.287 --> 01:26:51.455
Come on! What are
you talking about?

01:26:51.539 --> 01:26:54.208
I've seen what you can do!
Your father tried to kill you!

01:26:54.292 --> 01:26:57.920
They say he was crazy, but
it was because he knew!

01:26:59.172 --> 01:27:01.924
<i>I love you, Mark!
You're like my brother.</i>

01:27:02.008 --> 01:27:05.385
- No! No!
<i>- You are my brother.</i>

01:27:05.470 --> 01:27:07.930
And you mean more to me than-.

01:27:08.014 --> 01:27:11.117
The beast has no brother!
Don't call me your brother!

01:27:11.118 --> 01:27:12.392
Listen to me, Mark!

01:27:12.477 --> 01:27:14.561
Admit it! You
killed your mother!

01:27:14.646 --> 01:27:18.398
No! She wasn't my
mother. I was adopted.

01:27:18.483 --> 01:27:20.651
A jackal! You were
born of a jackal!

01:27:22.362 --> 01:27:27.658
Yes. Born in the image of the
greatest power in the world!

01:27:27.742 --> 01:27:29.910
<i>The Desolate One.</i>

01:27:29.994 --> 01:27:33.580
<i>Desolate because his greatness was
taken from him and he was cast down.</i>

01:27:33.665 --> 01:27:36.875
But he has risen, Mark, in me!

01:27:40.672 --> 01:27:44.591
Come with me, Mark.

01:27:44.676 --> 01:27:46.760
I can take you with me.

01:27:46.844 --> 01:27:49.680
No.

01:27:51.015 --> 01:27:55.185
- Don't make me beg you, Mark.
- No, Damien.

01:27:59.691 --> 01:28:02.276
Mark?

01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:04.403
Look at me, Mark.

01:28:10.994 --> 01:28:16.623
I'll ask you once more.
Please come with me.

01:29:04.589 --> 01:29:06.506
Mark.

01:29:09.719 --> 01:29:11.636
Oh, Mark.

01:29:14.307 --> 01:29:16.767
- What happened?
- I don't know.

01:29:16.851 --> 01:29:19.561
We were walking and he fell.

01:29:22.732 --> 01:29:26.485
- He fell.
- Get back to the house.

01:29:26.569 --> 01:29:28.528
I didn't do anything!

01:29:28.613 --> 01:29:33.116
He just fell. I
didn't do anything!

01:29:37.622 --> 01:29:41.875
<i>[ Minister ] All that the Father
giveth to me shall come to me.</i>

01:29:41.959 --> 01:29:47.005
<i>And him that cometh to me, I
will in no wise cast out.</i>

01:29:47.090 --> 01:29:50.967
<i>He that raised up Jesus from the
dead will also give life...</i>

01:29:51.052 --> 01:29:55.806
to our mortal bodies by his
spirit that dwelleth in us.

01:29:55.890 --> 01:29:59.601
<i>In sure and certain hope
of the resurrection...</i>

01:29:59.685 --> 01:30:01.937
<i>to eternal life through
our Lord, Jesus Christ.</i>

01:30:02.021 --> 01:30:06.066
<i>We commend to almighty
God, our brother, Mark.</i>

01:30:06.150 --> 01:30:11.863
<i>And we commit him to the ground.</i>

01:30:11.948 --> 01:30:15.158
<i>Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes...</i>

01:30:15.243 --> 01:30:18.620
dust to dust.

01:30:18.704 --> 01:30:20.747
Let us pray.

01:30:20.832 --> 01:30:24.167
<i>Merciful God, Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ...</i>

01:30:24.252 --> 01:30:26.545
<i>who is the resurrection
and the life.</i>

01:30:26.629 --> 01:30:29.840
<i>[ Richard's Voice ] How could it be,
Doctor? There would've been some sign.</i>

01:30:29.924 --> 01:30:32.467
<i>You've examined him a
dozen times yourself.</i>

01:30:32.552 --> 01:30:34.970
<i>[ Doctor's Voice ] I've seen
it happen before, I'm afraid.</i>

01:30:35.054 --> 01:30:40.100
<i>A perfectly normal boy or man,
seemingly healthy in all respects...</i>

01:30:40.184 --> 01:30:44.771
<i>but waiting in his brain a thin
artery wall, the wall collapses.</i>

01:30:44.856 --> 01:30:48.191
<i>[ Ann's Voice ] And-And it was
there from the time he was born?</i>

01:30:48.276 --> 01:30:53.238
<i>[ Doctor's Voice ] More than
likely. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.</i>

01:31:23.311 --> 01:31:26.980
I don't want to go,
Ann, I have to.

01:31:27.064 --> 01:31:30.817
Why can't you phone him? Why do you
have to go all the way to New York?

01:31:30.902 --> 01:31:33.695
Because I've heard
that he's in trouble.

01:31:33.779 --> 01:31:37.282
- Look, he needs me!
- I need you.

01:31:37.366 --> 01:31:39.409
I'll be back as
soon as possible.

01:32:40.388 --> 01:32:43.306
- Reverend Weston?
- Yes. May I help you?

01:32:43.391 --> 01:32:46.726
- I'm Richard Thorn.
- Mr. Thorn, I'm so glad you could come.

01:32:46.811 --> 01:32:49.980
- Come this way, please.
- I want to thank you for calling me.

01:32:50.064 --> 01:32:52.649
Can you tell me what's
wrong with him?

01:32:52.733 --> 01:32:54.985
He refuses to speak to me.

01:32:55.069 --> 01:32:58.613
All I can tell you is that
he's absolutely terrified.

01:32:58.698 --> 01:33:00.907
Who is it?

01:33:00.992 --> 01:33:04.578
Mr. Thorn is here.

01:33:07.373 --> 01:33:09.499
- Richard?
<i>- It's me, Charles.</i>

01:33:09.584 --> 01:33:11.501
I came as quickly as I...

01:33:16.507 --> 01:33:19.092
I saw the wall. It's
true. It's all true.

01:33:19.176 --> 01:33:21.503
The beast is with us. I've
seen the wall. It's horrible!

01:33:21.587 --> 01:33:23.805
- It drove Joan Hart mad.
Bugenhagen- - Where is it?

01:33:23.889 --> 01:33:27.559
- It's already been loaded. I saw Damien's face!
- Where is it?

01:34:27.787 --> 01:34:29.954
Come on, Charles.

01:34:58.526 --> 01:35:03.321
I can't go back in there. I'm
so frightened. Please hurry.

01:35:03.406 --> 01:35:06.157
<i>Please hurry!</i>

01:35:06.242 --> 01:35:09.285
Please?

01:36:41.921 --> 01:36:44.172
No! No! No!

01:37:47.236 --> 01:37:50.822
<i>[ Officer ] And now on
this graduation day...</i>

01:37:50.906 --> 01:37:53.700
<i>it gives me great pleasure
to honour those cadets...</i>

01:37:53.784 --> 01:37:57.245
<i>who have excelled in
individual achievement.</i>

01:37:57.329 --> 01:38:00.206
<i>The highest honor, the
Officer's Saber...</i>

01:38:00.291 --> 01:38:04.043
<i>is awarded each year to that
cadet who best exemplifies...</i>

01:38:04.128 --> 01:38:07.213
the character and
spirit of the academy.

01:38:07.298 --> 01:38:12.135
This year's recipient is
Cadet Sergeant Damien Thorn.

01:38:30.487 --> 01:38:32.447
Congratulations, Damien.

01:38:39.747 --> 01:38:41.789
<i>Davidson Military Academy...</i>

01:38:41.874 --> 01:38:46.878
<i>is now proud to promote the following
cadets to the grades as indicated.</i>

01:38:46.962 --> 01:38:50.757
I have to go. Richard will be
at the airport in half an hour.

01:38:50.841 --> 01:38:54.886
Will you be coming back for
the cotillion? I'll try.

01:38:57.181 --> 01:39:01.142
<i>Michael Fennig, promoted
to second lieutenant.</i>

01:39:02.728 --> 01:39:07.106
<i>John Hickox, promoted
to second lieutenant.</i>

01:39:22.990 --> 01:39:25.825
- Where's Damien?
- He's at the cotillion, sir.

01:39:25.910 --> 01:39:28.218
Get him and bring him to
the museum immediately.

01:39:28.219 --> 01:39:28.795
Why?

01:39:28.879 --> 01:39:31.297
- What about you, sir?
- We'll take a cab.

01:39:31.382 --> 01:39:33.883
[ Ann ] Why do you want Damien?

01:40:08.377 --> 01:40:12.588
You can't! You can't
make me believe it.

01:40:14.425 --> 01:40:16.342
How you doing?

01:40:16.427 --> 01:40:19.921
- You can't make me believe it.
- You've got to believe it.

01:40:20.005 --> 01:40:23.349
- He killed Mark. He killed Atherton and Pasarian.
- What are you talking about?

01:40:23.434 --> 01:40:26.628
And he'll keep on killing. He'll kill
anyone he thinks is threatening him!

01:40:26.712 --> 01:40:29.189
How? How did he kill them?
Did he make the ice crack?

01:40:29.190 --> 01:40:29.897
Not himself.

01:40:29.982 --> 01:40:33.151
Did he pull the gas
pipe apart? Did he?

01:40:45.956 --> 01:40:47.957
Excuse me, I have to go.

01:40:48.042 --> 01:40:50.043
[ Girl ] Oh.

01:41:00.179 --> 01:41:04.182
There are others. Surrounding him,
helping him, keeping him safe.

01:41:04.266 --> 01:41:08.227
Richard, listen to yourself.
Listen to how crazy you sound.

01:41:08.312 --> 01:41:11.731
Others! Devils! A conspiracy
of devils? Richard, please!

01:41:11.815 --> 01:41:15.985
Ann, I saw Charles killed! I
saw Damien's face on the wall!

01:41:18.363 --> 01:41:20.615
What are you going
to do? Richard?

01:41:27.164 --> 01:41:29.582
What are you doing?

01:41:29.666 --> 01:41:33.002
The daggers have to
be here somewhere.

01:41:33.087 --> 01:41:35.379
What do you want them for?

01:41:36.507 --> 01:41:39.425
- No. No!
- He's not human!

01:41:39.510 --> 01:41:43.137
He's your brother's son. He's a
boy you've loved for seven years!

01:41:43.222 --> 01:41:45.181
The boy has got to die!

01:42:16.421 --> 01:42:18.798
Richard! For me, Richard, don't.

01:42:18.882 --> 01:42:22.093
<i>Ann, what are you doing?
Get away from that drawer!</i>

01:42:22.177 --> 01:42:25.346
<i>[ Ann ] What you want to do
is crazy. I can't let you!</i>

01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:26.289
<i>Ann!</i>

01:42:26.290 --> 01:42:29.725
<i>You're obsessed with Damien.
It's making you sick.</i>

01:42:29.810 --> 01:42:32.228
Give me the daggers.

01:42:48.829 --> 01:42:52.373
- There are your daggers!
- Ann?

01:42:52.457 --> 01:42:54.750
I've always belonged to him.

01:43:00.257 --> 01:43:08.257
Damien!
