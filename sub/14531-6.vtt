WEBVTT

00:44.837 --> 00:46.380
[blowing raspberry]

00:50.634 --> 00:53.345
You're chipper. Before coffee.

00:53.428 --> 00:55.430
I'm teaching today.

00:55.514 --> 00:58.308
And I'd really appreciate it
if you would try for once

00:58.392 --> 01:00.268
to be polite to my students.

01:00.352 --> 01:02.437
I am polite to your convicts.

01:02.521 --> 01:05.524
They, however,
have no respect for my home.

01:05.607 --> 01:08.443
I saw one peeing out of
your studio window into the pool.

01:08.527 --> 01:11.030
That's why God invented chlorine.

01:11.112 --> 01:14.867
- Look at your healthy breakfast.
- I know.

01:17.745 --> 01:21.623
Yum! Double yum!

01:21.707 --> 01:23.918
- You want some?
- No thank you.

01:25.293 --> 01:27.546
Wait, what is there...
Is there something...

01:27.629 --> 01:30.340
Is your cap loose?
Open your mouth.

01:30.424 --> 01:31.425
Up here on this side.

01:31.508 --> 01:34.720
- Oh! God!
- [laughing]

01:38.265 --> 01:40.183
Now you can't eat until Monday.

01:41.226 --> 01:43.186
[cell phone chimes]

01:44.396 --> 01:47.399
- It's "lovestolaugh".
- Oh! From the alta cocker site?

01:47.482 --> 01:50.110
I "tickled" him last night.
And he "squeezed" me back.

01:50.193 --> 01:54.031
Enough with this tickling,
blinking, and butterfly kisses.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.116
Why don't you go out
with somebody already!

01:56.199 --> 01:59.369
Oh, God, he wants me
to have lunch today. I can't do that.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.371
Oh, why not?!

02:01.455 --> 02:04.458
He's a perfect match.
Except for the "loves to laugh" part.

02:04.541 --> 02:07.795
It's too fast. I don't know him.

02:07.878 --> 02:10.672
If you met him, you might know him.
That's how it works sometimes.

02:12.007 --> 02:16.470
Okay, but not today. I woke up puffy,
and my hair's not behaving.

02:16.553 --> 02:20.849
What is the point of doing all this
if you never go out with anybody?

02:20.933 --> 02:23.310
Well, maybe that is the point.

02:23.393 --> 02:27.397
I enjoy the positive feedback of a tickle
and I never have to leave the house.

02:27.481 --> 02:31.652
Or... and this is just me
thinking out loud...

02:31.735 --> 02:35.280
you go out... and you get laid.

02:36.281 --> 02:39.576
God, why are you
rushing me into this?

02:39.660 --> 02:43.038
Who's rushing you? You've been
on that thing for a month now,

02:43.122 --> 02:46.708
punching and fingering people
and you always find a reason not to go.

02:46.792 --> 02:50.129
I am not punching, or fingering, anyone.

02:50.211 --> 02:52.673
But you do have a point.

02:52.756 --> 02:54.215
Okay. Oh, God.

02:54.299 --> 02:59.513
My first date. In 40 years.
But it's just lunch, right?

02:59.596 --> 03:02.516
Yes. And lunch is no big deal.

03:02.599 --> 03:03.725
Here...

03:10.482 --> 03:12.233
Here, you might need these.

03:12.317 --> 03:15.737
- I'm going to a bistro, not having sex!
- [chuckles] Why not?

03:15.821 --> 03:19.825
You'd be too bloated from
the one piece of kale you might eat?

03:19.908 --> 03:23.787
[scoffs] Why do I need condoms anyway?
I'm not exactly a pregnancy risk.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.706
Well, no shit.

03:25.789 --> 03:28.167
But with all the new
penis drugs out there,

03:28.249 --> 03:32.504
old people are doing it like rabbits
and the STDs are on the rise.

03:32.587 --> 03:35.883
I read that in an AARP magazine.

03:35.966 --> 03:38.093
How old are these?

03:38.177 --> 03:40.804
Maybe I should check to see
if they've turned to dust.

03:40.888 --> 03:44.058
I only have three and a half hours
to get ready.

03:52.024 --> 03:55.318
- Where are my pills?
- They're in the bathroom.

03:55.402 --> 03:58.155
- What? Why?
- Because that's where pills belong.

03:58.238 --> 04:01.783
- But I like them in the kitchen.
- Well, that's insane.

04:01.867 --> 04:05.204
It's not insane
if you take your pills after breakfast.

04:05.286 --> 04:07.831
Okay, Sol. Here is what you do.

04:07.915 --> 04:10.542
You go, "Mmm, now that was a breakfast."

04:10.625 --> 04:14.713
Then you walk to the bathroom
and take your pills there.

04:14.796 --> 04:16.173
And I'm the crazy one?

04:16.256 --> 04:19.009
The extra walking alone
will take years off my life.

04:19.093 --> 04:21.136
Do you understand
the concept of exercise?

04:21.220 --> 04:23.304
The label says take with food.

04:23.388 --> 04:25.224
- Not take after a 5K.
- [laughing]

04:25.306 --> 04:28.518
- You're laughing at me?
- No, no. No, no, sorry.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.645
Look at us. We're bickering.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.191
- Right.
- [laughing]

04:35.442 --> 04:38.319
Let's stay home tonight.
Just the two of us.

04:38.403 --> 04:42.074
- We'll watch the Almodovar film.
- <i>Si, </i>and eat paella.

04:42.157 --> 04:44.076
I love paella. You can make paella?

04:44.159 --> 04:45.869
No, but I can make
the restaurant make it,

04:45.953 --> 04:48.413
- and have them bring it over.
- You're so powerful.

04:48.496 --> 04:51.917
<i>♪ Clean up the kitchen</i>
<i>Gonna shine up the pots ♪ </i>

04:52.000 --> 04:56.421
<i>♪ You're gonna make a supper</i>
<i>When the dishes are dry ♪</i>

04:59.382 --> 05:01.843
[loud rumbling]

05:04.096 --> 05:08.558
[shrieking]

05:09.851 --> 05:11.603
Drop, cover, hold on!

05:11.686 --> 05:13.939
- Are you okay?
- Earthquake!

05:14.022 --> 05:17.651
- It was barely a rumble.
- Were you in Sylmar in 1971?!

05:17.734 --> 05:21.155
Because I was!
I saw a little boy crushed by a tree.

05:21.238 --> 05:23.364
- You did?!
- Well, it was a lawn jockey,

05:23.448 --> 05:26.952
but it looked like a little boy.
It was very traumatizing.

05:27.035 --> 05:28.245
I barely felt this one.

05:28.328 --> 05:31.165
Shallow quakes produce more aftershocks.

05:31.248 --> 05:34.835
Or worse, it was a foreshock
before the mainshock.

05:34.918 --> 05:37.879
- Get away from the wall!
- Will you be reasonable?

05:37.963 --> 05:39.631
Mother Nature has no reason!

05:39.714 --> 05:42.176
Get under here. Get under here!

05:42.259 --> 05:44.385
I am not going to get
under the table. Frankie?

05:44.469 --> 05:45.720
[clears throat]

05:45.804 --> 05:47.889
Take a look. What do you think?
Am I trying too hard?

05:47.973 --> 05:49.683
- Trying...?
- To look young.

05:49.766 --> 05:53.145
I can't watch you die!
Please don't make me watch you die!

05:53.228 --> 05:55.689
- You're right, the scarf's too much.
- What you have to do,

05:55.772 --> 05:59.234
find a heavy object
to make a sloping roof.

05:59.318 --> 06:02.029
Triangle! Grace, triangle!

06:02.112 --> 06:03.905
Frankie, will you come out from there.

06:03.989 --> 06:06.449
That "triangle of life"
thing isn't even true.

06:06.533 --> 06:10.745
Don't tell me that!
It's all I have to believe in!

06:15.416 --> 06:18.795
- You all right?!
- I'm fine. It was just a rumbler.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.630
- You sure?
- Of course I'm sure.

06:20.714 --> 06:23.050
- Good. I have to go.
- Wh-what do you mean?

06:23.133 --> 06:25.760
- Where are you going?
- I have to go check on Frankie.

06:25.844 --> 06:29.848
- Why don't you just call her?
- She has this... Seismophobia.

06:29.931 --> 06:32.893
It's extreme. Don't ever try
to take her to Sylmar.

06:32.976 --> 06:35.270
But I thought
we'd have the day together.

06:35.354 --> 06:37.064
I'll come right back.

06:37.147 --> 06:41.151
Seriously, she freaks out.
It's her first quake alone.

06:41.235 --> 06:44.445
And the only one there
to give her comfort is Grace.

06:44.529 --> 06:45.655
Go.

06:48.658 --> 06:50.911
Drive safe.

06:50.994 --> 06:52.787
[door closes]

06:57.209 --> 06:59.169
[sighs]

07:00.170 --> 07:01.504
- Xanax?
- No.

07:01.588 --> 07:04.674
- Uh, Ativan?
- No.

07:04.758 --> 07:08.262
- Klonopin? Ambien?
- No, no. I have to stay alert.

07:09.470 --> 07:12.015
Vodka! Vodka is good.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.558
Vodka and Klonopin?

07:13.641 --> 07:14.809
- No.
- Even better.

07:14.893 --> 07:18.105
Was it more than twenty seconds?
More means tsunami risk.

07:18.188 --> 07:21.275
Go check the ocean.
Oh, no! Don't go near it!

07:21.358 --> 07:25.653
Frankie, enough. The San Andreas Fault's
100 miles from here.

07:25.737 --> 07:31.701
It's 50! And the Rose Canyon Fault
is right under us!

07:31.785 --> 07:32.911
- [phone chiming]
- I'll get it.

07:32.994 --> 07:37.165
Don't answer it! Leave the phone lines
open for emergency purposes!

07:37.249 --> 07:38.917
It's Bud. He's calling to check on you.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.961
- I should tell him to come over.
- [screaming] No!

07:41.044 --> 07:44.381
- The-the overpass could be crumbling!
- [chiming stops]

07:45.799 --> 07:50.262
Okay, now I am late for "lovestolaugh",
who you said I had to meet.

07:50.345 --> 07:52.722
If you want me to have a date
and a laugh,

07:52.806 --> 07:54.557
which I could really use right now,

07:54.641 --> 07:57.060
then would you
please come out from there?

07:57.144 --> 08:00.063
Oh, God.
Did you... did you turn off the gas?

08:00.147 --> 08:02.857
- What would I do that for?
- There could be fires.

08:02.941 --> 08:03.942
Oh, sweating.

08:06.194 --> 08:08.655
Look, I'm not a coddler, okay?

08:08.738 --> 08:11.574
I mean, if I were, then I would,
but I'm not, so I can't.

08:11.658 --> 08:14.328
So you have to
get the hell off the floor!

08:14.411 --> 08:16.121
Here. Here.

08:16.204 --> 08:19.499
Massage my chest. It's a thing.

08:19.582 --> 08:22.336
- It's not a thing I would do.
- I can't breathe.

08:22.419 --> 08:25.172
- Frankie?!
- Oh! Sol!

08:25.255 --> 08:28.049
I never thought I'd be
so happy to see you again.

08:28.133 --> 08:31.761
It was a 4.3 lasting 6.8 seconds.

08:31.845 --> 08:36.266
No casualties, outages,
or serious damage.

08:36.350 --> 08:38.185
Oh.

08:38.268 --> 08:41.771
- Are you belly breathing?
- No.

08:42.856 --> 08:46.443
- In-two-three-four.
- [inhales deeply]

08:46.526 --> 08:50.697
- Out-two-three-four.
- [exhales deeply]

08:51.739 --> 08:54.201
Think of your happy place.

08:54.284 --> 08:57.912
I can't. This is it. And it's going to
fall through the earth at any moment.

08:57.996 --> 09:01.582
- Out-of-state happy place.
- Okay.

09:01.666 --> 09:03.251
Yeah.

09:04.752 --> 09:07.547
- Good. Good.
- [sigh of relief]

09:23.688 --> 09:25.732
Do we need to get a restraining order?

09:25.815 --> 09:30.111
No. No, I didn't even think that you...

09:30.195 --> 09:33.073
I did call, but you didn't answer...

09:33.156 --> 09:35.200
It's probably because
you saw it was me calling.

09:35.283 --> 09:37.202
What are you doing here?

09:38.161 --> 09:41.248
- I brought you a gay penguin book.
- What?

09:42.416 --> 09:44.042
It's for the kids.

09:45.668 --> 09:48.796
You said that they were
having trouble understanding.

09:48.880 --> 09:51.508
And I thought that this
might help explain how--

09:51.591 --> 09:55.762
How two penguins can have a secret
homosexual affair for twenty years?

09:55.845 --> 09:58.681
No, we're gonna write that book.

09:58.765 --> 10:00.517
This is a more generalized...

10:00.600 --> 10:02.769
You know,
it's gay penguin... information.

10:07.690 --> 10:10.026
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.861
What's going on over there?

10:14.155 --> 10:16.491
We're taking Maddie off the pacifiers,

10:16.575 --> 10:20.287
so we planted them,
and now lollipops will grow.

10:20.370 --> 10:23.540
Oh, I don't think you understand
how gardening works.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.708
I don't think you understand
how children work.

10:25.792 --> 10:26.834
[chuckles]

10:26.918 --> 10:29.254
Why doesn't your bike
have a seat on it?

10:29.337 --> 10:32.757
Oh, I traded it
for the gay penguin book.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.675
Right.

10:34.759 --> 10:36.010
Are the kids home?

10:37.429 --> 10:39.306
Coyote, I do not think
that's a good idea.

10:39.389 --> 10:42.559
Right. No, I was...

10:42.642 --> 10:47.063
I was just wondering if one of them had
a bike seat that I could borrow, but...

10:47.147 --> 10:48.856
Okay. Let me see what I can do.

10:48.940 --> 10:51.401
Can you just stay
out of trouble for five minutes?

10:51.485 --> 10:52.611
Let's find out.

10:54.070 --> 10:55.238
[sighs]

11:00.243 --> 11:04.789
[laughing] That's amazing!
Look at that. So cool!

11:04.872 --> 11:05.999
Waaah!

11:12.755 --> 11:15.175
Your first Internet date?

11:15.258 --> 11:17.969
I'm honored.
It's... Pinch me.

11:18.052 --> 11:21.431
- [laughs]
- So... Have you done it much?

11:22.849 --> 11:24.267
Th-- This?

11:24.351 --> 11:28.355
Oh. Well, some.

11:28.438 --> 11:30.982
- Just watch out for the liars.
- Oh?

11:31.065 --> 11:32.984
Well, it's one thing
to shave off a few years.

11:33.067 --> 11:36.112
It's another thing to say you play tennis
every day but you're really...

11:36.196 --> 11:38.239
in a wheelchair and on oxygen.

11:38.323 --> 11:40.283
[laughs]

11:42.994 --> 11:44.912
So, what do you like to do?

11:44.996 --> 11:47.040
Play tennis every day.

11:47.123 --> 11:49.083
- That's funny!
- [laughter]

11:49.167 --> 11:51.961
- No, actually, I love tennis.
- Me, too. Any golf?

11:52.045 --> 11:53.547
- I love golf.
- Me, too.

11:53.630 --> 11:56.132
- And the symphony.
- I have a box!

11:56.216 --> 11:58.051
- Really?
- Yes, but between us,

11:58.134 --> 11:59.760
I'm not that big on modern music.

11:59.844 --> 12:02.138
It always sounds like something
falling down the stairs to me.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.265
I stop at Stravinsky.

12:04.349 --> 12:08.562
I yield at Stravinsky.
I stop at Shostakovich.

12:10.522 --> 12:14.275
I'd like a steak salad.
Very rare. No croutons.

12:14.359 --> 12:17.404
That is a drop dead gorgeous order.
I'll have the same.

12:17.487 --> 12:20.323
- And to drink, I'd like an iced tea.
- Damn, you are good.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.450
Bring me one of those.

12:22.534 --> 12:25.119
On second thought, I'll have
a dry vodka martini with a twist.

12:25.203 --> 12:29.624
Ditto that. Ditto dry, ditto vodka,
ditto martini, and ditto twist.

12:29.708 --> 12:32.085
- We got it.
- [chuckles]

12:41.219 --> 12:44.889
[exhales loudly]

12:47.267 --> 12:48.476
One more.

12:51.396 --> 12:53.856
[loud exhale]

12:56.276 --> 12:58.695
- You ready?
- Think so.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.160
Watch your head.

13:11.165 --> 13:12.375
You okay?

13:14.461 --> 13:15.545
Keep breathing.

13:15.629 --> 13:18.172
[exhales loudly]

13:18.256 --> 13:22.009
See? Everything is just as it was.

13:23.802 --> 13:24.929
Well, not exactly.

13:26.306 --> 13:29.517
Right. The house is just as it was.

13:29.601 --> 13:32.479
That. Is that a crack in the ceiling?

13:32.562 --> 13:37.358
Coyote's graduation party.
No idea how he got up there.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.531
Is that yours?

13:43.615 --> 13:45.074
Yes.

13:46.909 --> 13:50.497
It's different for you.
It's transcendent.

13:50.580 --> 13:51.998
I have goose bumps.

13:52.081 --> 13:54.626
Maybe you need a sweater.

13:54.709 --> 13:57.420
I think you're feeling better.

13:58.421 --> 14:01.007
- I think so.
- Well, I should...

14:01.090 --> 14:03.842
- Go.
- Yes.

14:06.471 --> 14:10.141
- You hungry?
- Starving.

14:10.224 --> 14:11.643
Maybe a bite?

14:15.146 --> 14:16.523
Yeah!

14:16.606 --> 14:18.817
There it is! [grunts]

14:18.899 --> 14:20.652
Hey, buddy!

14:23.237 --> 14:24.781
What the fuck are you doing here?

14:24.864 --> 14:28.034
Oh, shit. Mitch, I'm just outside.

14:28.117 --> 14:30.578
What are you doing at my house?
If you go near my wife again,

14:30.662 --> 14:34.165
I am gonna kick you in the balls
so hard that they go into your throat.

14:34.248 --> 14:37.251
Okay, it's really good
that you're a lady doctor,

14:37.335 --> 14:39.629
because, you know,
that's-that's not how it works.

14:39.713 --> 14:42.173
Oh, well, let me make it
medically accurate for you.

14:42.256 --> 14:45.510
I am going to jam your windpipe
full of your own testicles.

14:45.593 --> 14:47.970
[Coyote] Okay, that
doesn't sound fun for me.

14:48.054 --> 14:50.306
Okay, this is for you. Go.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.932
- Is that my bike seat?
- Go.

14:52.016 --> 14:53.309
- Thank you, Mallory.
- You. Shush.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.478
I'll mail it back
to you when I get a real one.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.313
It was nice chatting with you, Mitch.

14:58.064 --> 15:00.525
I thought we agreed that loser
was out of our lives.

15:00.608 --> 15:03.403
He needs to know
that he can't just come here.

15:03.486 --> 15:06.155
So you want me to tell
my future stepbrother

15:06.239 --> 15:08.700
that he can't come over to our house?

15:09.784 --> 15:12.537
Plenty of people don't let their
stepbrothers in their houses.

15:12.620 --> 15:14.789
He didn't come in.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.167
I'm never getting
that bike seat back, am I?

15:18.251 --> 15:20.920
- Probably not.
- Swell.

15:22.630 --> 15:25.216
You ever wonder how they age steak
so it doesn't rot?

15:27.968 --> 15:31.013
Look, if I'm too much,
just say, "Charlie, it's too much."

15:31.097 --> 15:32.807
Charles, it's a bit much.

15:32.891 --> 15:34.434
[laughs]

15:34.517 --> 15:38.563
See, that's what I love about you!
You just let me have it!

15:38.646 --> 15:41.274
I mean, look at her!
Can you believe I met her online?!

15:41.357 --> 15:43.735
Charles, please,
can you keep your voice down?

15:43.818 --> 15:46.195
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm a little deaf in one ear.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.448
It kind of throws off
my volume control.

15:48.531 --> 15:53.244
It's just... [inhales deeply]
I'm just so excited to be with you!

16:00.293 --> 16:01.878
What? Do-do I have something on...

16:01.961 --> 16:03.463
You've got a great mouth, kid.

16:03.546 --> 16:04.714
What?

16:04.798 --> 16:06.883
I wish I was that steak
that you are eating.

16:06.966 --> 16:10.929
Watching you eat that steak,
it's like watching Bernstein conduct

16:11.011 --> 16:13.013
- the overture to "Candide."
- Miss?

16:13.097 --> 16:15.850
Would you please
throw this away and bring the check.

16:30.072 --> 16:31.658
It feels good to just look at you.

16:31.741 --> 16:35.077
Don't do that, I'm not ready for that.

16:35.161 --> 16:36.746
- [rumbling]
- [shouts]

16:36.830 --> 16:39.415
No! Cement truck.

16:41.375 --> 16:43.920
Okay, okay.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.379
Belly breathe.

16:46.714 --> 16:49.425
- I... I hate this.
- What?

16:49.509 --> 16:53.304
This. We're acting normal
and nothing's normal.

16:53.387 --> 16:57.141
I am really sorry. No, I'm beyond sorry.

16:57.224 --> 16:59.686
Of all the human beings in the world--

16:59.769 --> 17:02.563
- I have a question.
- Okay.

17:02.647 --> 17:05.274
It's something
I can't stop thinking about,

17:05.358 --> 17:08.027
which is, believe me,
really not fun.

17:09.821 --> 17:11.990
How did it start with Robert?

17:14.868 --> 17:17.829
Oh. Um...

17:19.372 --> 17:20.874
Are you sure you want to know?

17:20.957 --> 17:24.878
Well, I'll be dead as soon as
the aftershock hits anyway, so, yes.

17:24.961 --> 17:27.672
[whimpers]

17:27.755 --> 17:32.051
Is that... a word or is that
just your acid reflux?

17:32.134 --> 17:35.972
It's just I didn't expect
to be doing this today.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.557
Me neither.

17:37.640 --> 17:39.392
[sighs]

17:44.564 --> 17:47.066
We were at a law conference
in New York.

17:47.149 --> 17:50.444
- Yeah.
- Robert and I...

17:50.528 --> 17:52.530
We'd had a good day.

17:52.613 --> 17:55.449
Did you know the Brooklyn Bridge
has a secret room?

17:55.533 --> 18:00.204
- It's full of crackers from 1957.
- I'm glad to know that.

18:00.287 --> 18:03.290
Now get back to the fucking around part.

18:06.126 --> 18:10.214
Well, we went to the hotel bar.

18:10.297 --> 18:15.177
Had a few drinks.
Maybe more than a few...

18:15.261 --> 18:18.932
Got in the elevator. Doors closed.

18:19.015 --> 18:21.434
And...

18:21.517 --> 18:24.729
- he gave me this look.
- What kind of look?

18:24.812 --> 18:28.357
It scared me.
I'd never seen it on him before.

18:28.441 --> 18:31.318
It was like, that's Robert,
my business partner,

18:31.402 --> 18:35.698
but that's not Robert,
my business partner. It was this man.

18:36.741 --> 18:40.828
And all I had was this... feeling.

18:40.912 --> 18:43.205
This... need.

18:44.457 --> 18:47.543
And it happened.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.796
- We kissed.
- Was it a big kiss?

18:49.879 --> 18:51.505
'Til the doors bing'd.

18:51.589 --> 18:54.425
- What floor were you on?
- Twenty-six.

18:54.508 --> 18:57.804
- That's a big kiss.
- I don't know how to describe it.

18:59.597 --> 19:03.267
My whole body... came alive.

19:03.350 --> 19:06.186
My blood... rocket fuel.

19:08.982 --> 19:11.776
It was just... different.

19:11.859 --> 19:15.446
Different, because it was a man?
Or because it was Robert?

19:15.529 --> 19:18.074
- Probably both.
- And that was it?

19:18.157 --> 19:19.533
You were in love?

19:19.617 --> 19:23.037
No. We went to our rooms
and we didn't even talk about it.

19:23.121 --> 19:25.164
Well, how could you not talk about it?

19:25.247 --> 19:27.792
We couldn't.
We didn't know how.

19:27.875 --> 19:30.711
And then four months later
it happened again.

19:30.795 --> 19:36.009
And this type of thing never happened...
with anyone? Before?

19:36.092 --> 19:40.346
No. Never.
It's not like I chose this.

19:40.429 --> 19:43.975
I tried not to choose it.
We both kept praying it would go away.

19:44.058 --> 19:46.310
We broke it off, repeatedly.

19:46.393 --> 19:49.271
In all that time,
why didn't you tell me?

19:49.355 --> 19:50.523
I couldn't.

19:52.650 --> 19:56.403
It had gone from sex to love.
If I'd told you...

19:57.404 --> 19:59.824
You would've ended our marriage.

19:59.907 --> 20:00.950
Um...

20:01.034 --> 20:04.328
I still loved you. And our family.

20:04.411 --> 20:05.913
And Robert.

20:05.997 --> 20:07.915
It was torture.

20:14.505 --> 20:15.798
I'm sorry I asked.

20:17.091 --> 20:18.009
Yeah.

20:21.179 --> 20:22.972
Kind of. [chuckles]

20:31.438 --> 20:33.357
[gasps]

20:33.440 --> 20:37.070
Who are you? What are you doing?

20:37.153 --> 20:38.988
I'm going to call the police!

20:39.072 --> 20:41.657
I didn't mean to scare you.
I'm here for Frankie's art class.

20:41.741 --> 20:44.827
- I'm definitely calling the police.
- She wasn't in the studio,

20:44.911 --> 20:47.454
I came by to see
if she was okay after the quake.

20:47.538 --> 20:50.416
Saw some ham.
Thought I'd make a sandwich.

20:50.499 --> 20:53.836
- The door was open?
- It opened.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.629
Well, I'm just going to call her.

20:55.713 --> 20:57.673
- [gasps]
- [chuckles]

20:57.757 --> 20:58.799
Having a good day?

20:58.883 --> 21:01.052
They're not mine.
Frankie put them in.

21:02.386 --> 21:05.139
I had a date.
It was just a little lunch.

21:05.223 --> 21:08.350
That's all I'm doing.
Just a little lunch.

21:10.561 --> 21:11.687
Okay.

21:15.441 --> 21:18.236
Frankie told us about your husbands.

21:18.318 --> 21:20.404
I know a lot of men
that have done stupid shit.

21:20.487 --> 21:23.699
But nothing as stupid as leaving you.

21:27.494 --> 21:28.996
Uh...

21:30.164 --> 21:32.541
What did you go to prison for?

21:32.625 --> 21:36.170
Invited myself into someone's
house one night.

21:36.254 --> 21:37.255
Stole his ham.

21:37.337 --> 21:38.839
[laughs]

21:38.923 --> 21:40.591
And his car.

21:40.674 --> 21:42.468
Oh.

21:42.551 --> 21:44.929
Can I just say,
you are smoking hot?

21:45.012 --> 21:47.014
You can say whatever you like...

21:47.098 --> 21:50.810
Okay. Please tell me
that if he wasn't fucking you,

21:50.893 --> 21:52.145
somebody else was.

21:52.228 --> 21:56.065
- Oh...
- [rumbling]

22:08.161 --> 22:09.578
[rumbling fades]

22:09.662 --> 22:11.538
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

22:11.622 --> 22:15.501
- It was just an aftershock.
- I know.

22:15.584 --> 22:17.753
Are you breathing?

22:17.837 --> 22:20.131
Yes, I'm fucking breathing.

22:20.214 --> 22:22.424
When we die, I'll be breathing.

22:23.801 --> 22:26.262
- [sighs]
- I never thought we'd do this again.

22:27.387 --> 22:28.681
Dessert menu?

22:28.764 --> 22:31.809
We'll have the carrot cake
and two forks, please.

22:31.892 --> 22:33.769
Thank you.

22:44.362 --> 22:46.573
I did jimmy the door.

22:54.540 --> 22:56.374
[moaning]

22:56.458 --> 22:58.961
Oh, oh.

22:59.045 --> 23:00.796
Oh, gosh...

23:05.259 --> 23:06.844
Whoa.

23:23.277 --> 23:27.240
One, two, three, four...
[laughing]

23:27.323 --> 23:29.658
One, two, three four...

23:29.742 --> 23:33.162
One, two, three, four...
One, two, three, four...

23:34.663 --> 23:36.790
- Smells good...
- Hey, Sol!

23:36.874 --> 23:40.418
- Al. Eddie.
- Hi.

23:40.502 --> 23:42.004
I didn't know we were having a party.

23:42.088 --> 23:44.631
I didn't know you'd be three hours late.

23:44.715 --> 23:47.134
I didn't know you'd start without me.

23:47.218 --> 23:49.469
- Oh, we have to go.
- Stay, fellas.

23:49.553 --> 23:51.389
- Great meal!
- But there's flan.

23:51.471 --> 23:53.974
- Oh, not a flan fan.
- Don't leave on my account.

23:54.058 --> 23:56.560
[Eddie] We're leaving
on both our accounts. Bye!

23:56.643 --> 23:59.272
[door opens, closes]

23:59.855 --> 24:01.732
If you're upset, you have to tell me.

24:01.815 --> 24:03.483
I'm not upset.

24:03.567 --> 24:06.904
You wanted to be with Frankie,
I wanted to eat paella.

24:06.987 --> 24:10.490
So I invited Al and Eddie.
There, I told you.

24:10.574 --> 24:14.328
Okay. Okay, anger.

24:14.412 --> 24:16.038
Good.

24:16.122 --> 24:19.292
I appreciate the feeling
and I encourage its expression.

24:19.375 --> 24:21.419
Please don't talk to me
the way you talk to her.

24:21.501 --> 24:22.628
This is how I talk.

24:22.711 --> 24:24.297
Why did we blow up our lives

24:24.380 --> 24:26.966
if you're gonna go running off
to your wife at the drop of a hat?

24:27.049 --> 24:29.593
- There was an earthquake!
- Exactly!

24:29.676 --> 24:32.138
But I texted I was running late,
and you said "fine."

24:32.221 --> 24:34.265
No! No, no, no, Sol.

24:34.348 --> 24:37.435
When you texted "how are you,"
that's when I wrote "fine."

24:37.517 --> 24:41.939
When you texted "running late,"
I didn't write anything at all.

24:42.022 --> 24:44.150
How very mature.

24:44.233 --> 24:46.235
[cell phone buzzing]

24:46.319 --> 24:48.237
That her?

24:48.321 --> 24:51.365
This is my home.
And you are my life.

24:54.868 --> 24:59.706
I'm sorry about the text mix-up.
I should have called.

25:01.125 --> 25:04.878
I'm sorry, too.
I should have been more clear.

25:07.256 --> 25:10.009
- You must be starving.
- I could eat.

25:28.861 --> 25:30.321
[knock on door]

25:30.404 --> 25:32.072
So, how did your date go?

25:34.200 --> 25:37.161
- Unexpectedly.
- See?

25:37.244 --> 25:41.040
It was a good day,
except for almost dying.

25:41.123 --> 25:45.211
- One of your students stopped by.
- Oh, I forgot to cancel.

25:45.294 --> 25:47.004
It must have been Byron.

25:47.087 --> 25:50.674
- I didn't catch his name.
- Very talented.

25:53.135 --> 25:56.013
So, where were you all afternoon?

25:56.096 --> 25:59.183
- Under a table.
- Oh, well, good for you.

26:10.277 --> 26:11.695
Choke that chicken!

26:11.778 --> 26:14.240
[laughs]
