AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER:
287 Mother,

00:11.185 --> 00:12.664
position and hold on deck.

00:12.708 --> 00:15.537
PILOT:
287, position and hold.

00:15.580 --> 00:18.148
[indistinct radio chatter]

00:18.192 --> 00:21.064
302 Mother,
come around to heading 080.

00:21.108 --> 00:24.024
302 Mother.

00:24.067 --> 00:26.896
302, please ident.

00:28.898 --> 00:31.683
Sir, we may have
something brewing.

00:31.727 --> 00:32.945
Who is it?

00:32.989 --> 00:34.599
Weeks. On a post-maintenance
check flight.

00:34.643 --> 00:35.644
She's gone wandering.

00:39.300 --> 00:41.519
What is she doing
way out there?

00:41.563 --> 00:43.173
Don't know, sir.
She's nonresponsive.

00:43.217 --> 00:45.175
OFFICER:
302 Mother.

00:45.219 --> 00:47.525
Weeks, are you there?

00:47.569 --> 00:49.701
305 Mother,

00:49.745 --> 00:51.355
we have a situation here.

00:51.399 --> 00:53.357
Need you to vector to 230

00:53.401 --> 00:54.358
and check on Weeks.

00:54.402 --> 00:55.751
PILOT:
Negative.

00:55.794 --> 00:57.796
I don't have the fuel
to get out there and back.

00:57.840 --> 01:00.277
Garcia, what's her heading?

01:00.321 --> 01:02.975
Bearing 260. Speed,

01:03.019 --> 01:04.977
700 knots.
Altitude,

01:05.021 --> 01:07.197
18,000 and descending.

01:07.241 --> 01:08.720
Descending?

01:11.158 --> 01:12.898
OFFICER:
Weeks, Mother.

01:12.942 --> 01:14.378
Switch to guard freq

01:14.422 --> 01:17.120
and squawk if you hear me.

01:18.774 --> 01:20.428
MAN [on P.A.]:
Flight deck in starboard.[alarm blaring]

01:20.471 --> 01:23.083
Rescue and assistance teams
to the ready room.

01:23.126 --> 01:25.737
Flight deck,
prepare the starboard.

01:25.781 --> 01:27.783
Rescue and assistance teams
to the ready room.

01:30.786 --> 01:34.137
Commander, we may have
an unconscious pilot up there.

01:34.181 --> 01:36.008
Heading?East-southeast.

01:36.052 --> 01:37.271
Altitude 8,000
and dropping.

01:37.314 --> 01:39.229
She'll hit the mainland
in 90 seconds.

01:39.273 --> 01:42.363
Weeks? Commander May.

01:42.406 --> 01:44.104
Need you to wake up, Lieutenant.

01:47.455 --> 01:49.021
Sir, if she's hypoxic,

01:49.065 --> 01:50.719
we should implement
the White Knife protocol.

01:50.762 --> 01:52.286
We're not shooting down
my pilot.

01:52.329 --> 01:53.852
Sir, we need to...Give it a minute.

01:53.896 --> 01:57.639
Weeks, talk to me.

01:57.682 --> 02:00.903
Sir, she will be over
a population center

02:00.946 --> 02:02.339
in 40 seconds.

02:03.601 --> 02:05.777
MAY: Weeks, talk to me.COMPUTER: Pull up.

02:05.821 --> 02:07.779
Pull up.WEEKS: I'm sorry.

02:07.823 --> 02:10.260
MAY: Rebecca!Pull up. Pull up.

02:11.827 --> 02:13.829
Weeks, you there?
Say again.

02:16.527 --> 02:18.442
Sir.

02:18.486 --> 02:20.488
We've lost radar contact.

02:20.531 --> 02:22.490
Aircraft impacted the ocean.

02:22.533 --> 02:24.318
She bail out?
She eject?

02:24.361 --> 02:26.015
No, sir.

02:31.325 --> 02:33.327
â™ª

03:01.703 --> 03:04.662
So the guy honks, and
it's not even my fault,

03:04.706 --> 03:08.057
but the ambulance-- he didn't
even have his lights on.

03:08.100 --> 03:10.538
Hmm. Yeah.Yeah?

03:10.581 --> 03:13.802
That's it? That's all
you're gonna give me?

03:13.845 --> 03:15.543
That's a funny story, Tim.

03:15.586 --> 03:17.806
All you give me is "yeah"?

03:17.849 --> 03:19.982
You've said two words
this morning.

03:20.025 --> 03:23.115
Yeah, sorry, I got...
I got a lot on my mind.

03:23.159 --> 03:25.770
Hey, listen, I'm here
if you want to talk.

03:25.814 --> 03:27.772
I appreciate that,
but, uh,

03:27.816 --> 03:29.905
I don't really want
to get into it, you know.

03:29.948 --> 03:32.603
Besides, Bishop is,
like, right there, so...

03:32.647 --> 03:33.996
[whispering]:
What did she do?

03:34.039 --> 03:35.171
She didn't do anything.

03:38.566 --> 03:39.828
I'm getting a vasectomy.

03:39.871 --> 03:42.657
Oh. Oh, oh.

03:42.700 --> 03:44.398
Oh.

03:44.441 --> 03:46.269
I'm sorry.

03:46.313 --> 03:48.445
No, don't be sorry.
It's a good thing.

03:48.489 --> 03:50.099
Getting surgery is
a good thing?

03:50.142 --> 03:51.579
Getting surgery down there...

03:51.622 --> 03:54.190
I know where
they do it, Nick.

03:54.234 --> 03:57.062
And you still said yes?Yes.

03:57.106 --> 03:58.890
Yeah, you know,
Delilah and I decided

03:58.934 --> 04:00.849
one set of twins is enough.

04:00.892 --> 04:04.374
I mean, we-we had
a scare last month, so...

04:04.418 --> 04:05.810
Why can't she do it?

04:05.854 --> 04:08.248
I would never ask her
to do something like that.

04:08.291 --> 04:09.640
So she said no, huh?

04:09.684 --> 04:10.641
Decisively.

04:10.685 --> 04:12.600
Damn. But what if they...

04:14.863 --> 04:16.560
...like, snip on the wrong wire?

04:16.604 --> 04:18.301
It's not a bomb, Nick.

04:18.345 --> 04:20.085
Besides, there's
no knives involved.

04:20.129 --> 04:23.088
I chose the "no scalpel" option.

04:23.132 --> 04:26.178
How are they gonna cut
anything without a knife?

04:26.222 --> 04:28.572
I'm not sure.

04:28.616 --> 04:29.878
Science?

04:29.921 --> 04:32.576
Bishop, grab your go bag.

04:32.620 --> 04:34.491
F-18 went down
in the Atlantic.

04:34.535 --> 04:36.276
Helo's waiting.

04:36.319 --> 04:37.842
Uh, where to?

04:37.886 --> 04:39.279
The Franklin Roosevelt.

04:40.584 --> 04:43.326
You two stay here, dig up
all you can on the pilot.

04:43.370 --> 04:44.980
Sir.

04:46.808 --> 04:49.724
Lieutenant Rebecca Weeks.

04:49.767 --> 04:53.293
MAY:
Lieutenant Weeks was
the best I had.

04:53.336 --> 04:54.903
Brilliant pilot,
highly decorated,

04:54.946 --> 04:57.122
on a routine training mission
on a perfect day for flying.

04:57.166 --> 04:58.907
She wasn't able to eject?No, ma'am.

04:58.950 --> 05:00.343
Any idea why?

05:00.387 --> 05:02.519
She had to be suffering
from hypoxia.

05:02.563 --> 05:03.781
Lack of oxygen?

05:03.825 --> 05:05.914
That's the only explanation
that makes sense.

05:05.957 --> 05:08.351
The onboard oxygen
generating system malfunctions,

05:08.395 --> 05:10.527
things can go south fast.

05:10.571 --> 05:11.833
She make a distress call?

05:11.876 --> 05:14.966
No, sir, but hypoxia
can make a pilot become

05:15.010 --> 05:17.012
disoriented, confused
or unconscious.

05:17.055 --> 05:19.319
We understand that
she said "I'm sorry"

05:19.362 --> 05:20.494
before the accident,

05:20.537 --> 05:23.453
so she wasn't unconscious then.Correct.

05:23.497 --> 05:25.368
Any other idea why
she might have apologized?

05:25.412 --> 05:27.022
I know what you're thinking,
and I'll stop you right there.

05:27.065 --> 05:30.330
She was not the type of person
to commit suicide.

05:30.373 --> 05:33.158
I didn't know suicide
had a type.

05:33.202 --> 05:34.725
We'll need the cockpit
recording, Commander,

05:34.769 --> 05:36.466
and the telemetry.

05:36.510 --> 05:37.815
You got it.

05:37.859 --> 05:40.644
Listen, Lieutenant Weeks
was not just my pilot,

05:40.688 --> 05:42.342
she was a family friend.

05:42.385 --> 05:44.561
Anything you need,
just ask.

05:44.605 --> 05:46.389
Lieutenant Logan
is Weeks' bunkmate.

05:46.433 --> 05:48.652
She'll take you
the rest of the way.Yes, sir.

05:48.696 --> 05:49.914
Thank you, Commander.

05:49.958 --> 05:51.873
Follow me, please.

05:53.396 --> 05:55.877
We're sorry about
what happened.

05:55.920 --> 05:56.921
Thank you, ma'am.

05:56.965 --> 05:58.836
You have not been
in your quarters

05:58.880 --> 06:00.185
since the accident, Lieutenant?

06:00.229 --> 06:03.363
No, sir. Orders were to wait
until you arrived.

06:06.453 --> 06:08.106
[screams]

06:20.423 --> 06:23.426
MAY: Weeks, talk to me.COMPUTER: Pull up. Pull up.

06:23.470 --> 06:24.862
WEEKS:
I'm sorry.

06:24.906 --> 06:26.734
MAY: Rebecca.Pull up. Pull...

06:26.777 --> 06:28.562
That's it?

06:28.605 --> 06:30.172
That's it.

06:30.215 --> 06:32.653
14 seconds later,
the F-18 hit the ocean.

06:32.696 --> 06:34.437
Have they found
the wreckage yet?

06:34.481 --> 06:36.483
Still looking.

06:36.526 --> 06:39.007
VANCE:
What are you sorry about,
Lieutenant?

06:39.050 --> 06:41.923
Maybe the dead guy
in her bunk?Right.

06:41.966 --> 06:44.055
What do we know
about the victim?

06:44.099 --> 06:45.753
Well, Petty Officer First Class

06:45.796 --> 06:47.624
Fisher Patrick.
21 years old,

06:47.668 --> 06:49.060
ship quartermaster.

06:49.104 --> 06:51.628
Jimmy choppered him back
to NCIS this morning.

06:51.672 --> 06:53.021
Torres is talking
to his mother now.

06:53.064 --> 06:55.458
Any connection between
him and Lieutenant Weeks?

06:55.502 --> 06:57.025
Well, their duties
didn't overlap,

06:57.068 --> 06:58.461
so they wouldn't have
crossed paths,

06:58.505 --> 07:00.985
but they lived on
the same ship, so it's possible

07:01.029 --> 07:03.814
they knew each other.Oh, they knew each other.

07:03.858 --> 07:05.250
They were dating.

07:05.294 --> 07:07.470
His mom said they kept
their relationship a secret.

07:07.514 --> 07:10.517
Ah, because officers dating
enlisted is prohibited.

07:10.560 --> 07:12.954
So are we talking
murder-suicide?

07:12.997 --> 07:14.738
Or suicide-suicide.[phone dings]

07:14.782 --> 07:16.479
Let's see what Palmer
has to say.

07:16.523 --> 07:18.873
He's done with the autopsy.Okay.

07:18.916 --> 07:20.614
JIMMY:
I know, but

07:20.657 --> 07:22.790
swollen glands are
completely normal.

07:22.833 --> 07:24.400
I tell you what,
just pump her full of fluids

07:24.444 --> 07:27.403
and if she spikes above 103,
just give me a call.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.405
Yeah, love you.

07:29.449 --> 07:32.103
Hey. Everything okay?Yeah, Victoria's
running a fever,

07:32.147 --> 07:34.062
and Breena's stressing out.

07:34.105 --> 07:36.064
She just wants to make sure
she's doing everything right.

07:36.107 --> 07:38.545
You know?Yeah, I get it.

07:38.588 --> 07:40.547
Good thing she's got
a doctor on call, huh?

07:40.590 --> 07:42.462
[both chuckle]

07:42.505 --> 07:46.248
You guys ever-ever think about
giving her a younger sibling?

07:46.291 --> 07:48.468
You know, it's funny
you mention that.

07:48.511 --> 07:50.818
It's not like we're
advertising it or anything,

07:50.861 --> 07:52.776
but I think we're gonna
try for one more

07:52.820 --> 07:54.082
before I close up shop.

07:54.125 --> 07:57.955
Good for you.
That's great.

08:00.567 --> 08:02.351
Let me ask you, uh,
closing up shop--

08:02.394 --> 08:04.962
is that as easy as,
uh, doctors say?

08:05.006 --> 08:07.312
You're thinking of doing it.

08:07.356 --> 08:08.792
Well, no, I'm not
just thinking about it,

08:08.836 --> 08:10.533
I'm actually...
I'm actually doing it.

08:13.101 --> 08:15.277
Had a conversation
with Torres earlier,

08:15.320 --> 08:17.497
and it kind of
made me fidgety.

08:17.540 --> 08:20.543
Oh, don't listen to Torres.
He probably read that clickbait

08:20.587 --> 08:24.373
horror story online about the
guy with the weird complication.

08:25.679 --> 08:27.942
What-what guy with
the weird complication?

08:27.985 --> 08:29.552
I wouldn't look it up.

08:29.596 --> 08:33.295
The point is male sterilization
is simple, and it is safe.

08:33.338 --> 08:36.080
I mean, you probably won't even
miss a full day of work, Tim.

08:36.124 --> 08:39.519
Oh, that's great. Great.
Thank you, Jimmy.Mm.

08:39.562 --> 08:41.869
Um, when they say...
they say no scalpel,

08:41.912 --> 08:43.131
they mean no scalpel, right?

08:43.174 --> 08:44.349
Oh, right. Yeah, yeah.

08:44.393 --> 08:46.656
The doctors use
a clamp and a needle

08:46.700 --> 08:47.875
It's actually really neat.

08:47.918 --> 08:49.398
I can show you...No, I'm good, I'm good.

08:49.441 --> 08:50.573
I'm good.

08:50.617 --> 08:53.533
No demonstration needed.
Thank you, though.

08:53.576 --> 08:55.665
Let's, uh, let's-let's talk
about this guy for a minute.

08:55.709 --> 08:58.102
Gladly, yes. Uh,

08:58.146 --> 08:59.669
Petty Officer Patrick

08:59.713 --> 09:02.498
died of a cardiac arrest

09:02.542 --> 09:05.414
caused by a massive amount
of oxycodone.

09:05.457 --> 09:06.589
How massive?

09:06.633 --> 09:08.286
He had over 300 milligrams
in his system.

09:08.330 --> 09:09.679
That's a lot of pills.

09:09.723 --> 09:12.203
Yeah, that is way more
than a recreational dose.

09:12.247 --> 09:15.206
So what do you think,
suicide or homicide?

09:15.250 --> 09:16.556
See, that he is not
telling me.

09:16.599 --> 09:19.559
But if I had to
venture a guess,

09:19.602 --> 09:20.995
I would lean towards homicide.

09:21.038 --> 09:23.388
Why is that?His stomach contents.

09:23.432 --> 09:26.130
He had bacon, eggs,

09:26.174 --> 09:29.481
avocado, potatoes
and cantaloupe.

09:29.525 --> 09:31.701
Well, maybe he just
wanted one last meal.

09:31.745 --> 09:33.573
Yeah, maybe, but...

09:33.616 --> 09:36.706
I've seen my share
of poison suicides down here,

09:36.750 --> 09:39.100
and they rarely eat beforehand.

09:40.188 --> 09:42.277
Interferes with the poison.

09:43.104 --> 09:44.932
[indistinct announcement
over P.A.]

09:47.108 --> 09:50.067
"Take one tablet every
four to six hours

09:50.111 --> 09:52.417
as needed for the pain."

09:52.461 --> 09:54.332
Well, we know where
he got the oxy from.

09:54.376 --> 09:55.595
His girlfriend.

09:57.248 --> 09:58.685
Those pills beige?

09:58.728 --> 10:01.035
Yeah.
How'd you know that?

10:01.078 --> 10:03.254
Well, this was in her lockbox.

10:03.298 --> 10:06.693
Is that oxy in powder form?

10:08.651 --> 10:10.174
Same color powder on this.

10:10.218 --> 10:13.613
Makeshift pill crusher.[knocking]

10:13.656 --> 10:15.527
Uh, yeah, come on in.

10:15.571 --> 10:17.617
Excuse me.
You wanted to see me?

10:17.660 --> 10:19.923
Yeah, uh, Lieutenant,
we just, uh...

10:19.967 --> 10:22.099
we have a few questions
to ask you about your bunkmate.

10:23.492 --> 10:25.189
Uh,

10:25.233 --> 10:27.714
I don't want
to say anything bad.

10:27.757 --> 10:29.803
What does that mean?

10:31.326 --> 10:32.893
I'm gonna go see the commander.Okay.

10:32.936 --> 10:34.503
You two chat.

10:37.985 --> 10:39.551
Listen, Harper,

10:39.595 --> 10:43.033
we're just trying to figure out
what happened here.

10:43.077 --> 10:44.469
We already know that Weeks

10:44.513 --> 10:46.167
and Petty Officer Patrick
were dating.

10:47.821 --> 10:49.779
I would help her

10:49.823 --> 10:51.781
sneak him in some nights.

10:51.825 --> 10:53.609
He's not allowed on O-1.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.567
Any problems
in their relationship?

10:55.611 --> 10:57.482
I didn't think so,

10:57.526 --> 11:00.224
not until they
broke up last week.

11:00.268 --> 11:01.748
Who ended it?

11:01.791 --> 11:05.142
He dumped her. Told her
she was too old for him.

11:05.186 --> 11:06.970
Oh, wow. Classy.

11:07.014 --> 11:09.190
She was...

11:09.233 --> 11:11.192
pretty pissed off.

11:11.235 --> 11:13.542
Pissed off enough to kill him?

11:14.848 --> 11:18.155
Wait, Fisher was murdered?

11:18.199 --> 11:20.549
It's looking like that, yeah.

11:22.420 --> 11:25.336
What? Lieutenant,

11:25.380 --> 11:27.861
if you know something,
now is the time to say it.

11:28.905 --> 11:30.515
It's just, she told me

11:30.559 --> 11:32.343
that he was going to be

11:32.387 --> 11:34.476
very sorry for dumping her.

11:36.434 --> 11:40.003
They're en route to the crash
site. Awaiting your orders.

11:40.047 --> 11:42.614
Okay, expand the search grid
three miles northeast.

11:42.658 --> 11:45.400
Yes, sir.

11:45.443 --> 11:47.358
Any luck finding
the wreckage?

11:47.402 --> 11:49.360
Yes.

11:49.404 --> 11:51.058
Parts of a wing.

11:51.101 --> 11:52.712
We've been combing
the ocean all day

11:52.755 --> 11:56.237
and the biggest piece we found
is 18 inches long.

11:56.280 --> 11:58.587
That aircraft was obliterated.

11:59.893 --> 12:01.198
Sorry.

12:01.242 --> 12:02.852
You know,
in the back of my mind,

12:02.896 --> 12:04.462
I was holding out hope
that somehow

12:04.506 --> 12:06.290
Weeks survived the crash,

12:06.334 --> 12:09.424
but finding pieces that small...

12:11.382 --> 12:13.384
How's your investigation
going topside?

12:13.428 --> 12:15.125
Coming along.

12:15.169 --> 12:18.738
The hell was he doing
in Weeks' bunk?

12:18.781 --> 12:21.131
You didn't know
they were a couple?

12:21.175 --> 12:22.654
No.

12:22.698 --> 12:26.441
Why was Weeks prescribed
oxycodone last month?

12:26.484 --> 12:28.225
She took a hard landing.

12:28.269 --> 12:30.271
Harness jammed
her shoulder real good.

12:32.229 --> 12:34.492
Did the petty officer
OD on oxy?

12:35.929 --> 12:37.278
Could he have drugged Weeks
before her flight?

12:37.321 --> 12:38.888
That could explain the crash.

12:38.932 --> 12:42.283
Or it was the other way
around-- she drugged him.

12:42.326 --> 12:44.328
If you're implying
Lieutenant Weeks

12:44.372 --> 12:46.678
killed that sailor,
you're way off-base.

12:46.722 --> 12:49.116
I won't let you disparage
her good name, not in this room,

12:49.159 --> 12:51.814
and not on this ship.

12:51.858 --> 12:53.511
I have work to do.

12:58.690 --> 13:00.780
What's up?Nick, look at this.

13:00.823 --> 13:02.216
When a pilot ejects,

13:02.259 --> 13:04.522
they experience
the greatest g-forces

13:04.566 --> 13:06.437
ever felt by a human.

13:06.481 --> 13:08.613
Up to 22 times
the force of gravity.

13:08.657 --> 13:10.833
It's like hitting
a brick wall of air.

13:10.877 --> 13:12.792
Ejecting can
break bones,

13:12.835 --> 13:15.229
it can injure spines,
it can damage lungs.

13:15.272 --> 13:16.796
Yeah, it beats
the alternative, though.

13:16.839 --> 13:18.667
Oh, exactly. Most pilots
survive ejection,

13:18.710 --> 13:19.886
which is all that matters.

13:19.929 --> 13:21.757
Hey, why are you
showing me this?

13:21.801 --> 13:23.498
Lieutenant Weeks didn't eject.

13:23.541 --> 13:26.544
Right. No, she absolutely
did not eject.

13:27.676 --> 13:29.460
Except I think she did.

13:29.504 --> 13:31.462
What? Why?Okay.

13:31.506 --> 13:33.813
In an F-18, when
a pilot ejects,

13:33.856 --> 13:35.815
an electronic locator
starts transmitting,

13:35.858 --> 13:37.686
so rescuers can find them.

13:37.729 --> 13:39.470
No, the Navy said
that didn't happen.

13:39.514 --> 13:42.343
It didn't because according
to the telemetry,

13:42.386 --> 13:45.825
she disengaged that transmitter
right before she crashed.

13:45.868 --> 13:47.478
You're saying she did that
on purpose?

13:47.522 --> 13:50.786
Absolutely. She would've had to
cut a wire under her seat.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.614
Why would she do that?

13:52.657 --> 13:54.834
I can only think of one reason

13:54.877 --> 13:57.793
why she'd want to
eject below radar

13:57.837 --> 13:59.839
without anyone knowing.

14:01.884 --> 14:04.844
To fake her own death.

14:13.853 --> 14:17.291
Yo.
That water is ice-cold.

14:17.334 --> 14:18.683
Well, yeah, it's winter.

14:18.727 --> 14:20.555
I don't know, man.

14:20.598 --> 14:22.731
It's a long way
for someone to swim

14:22.774 --> 14:23.906
in freezing water.

14:23.950 --> 14:25.734
Well, she wouldn't
have had to swim.

14:25.777 --> 14:28.084
Ejection kits come
included with, uh,

14:28.128 --> 14:29.912
one-man inflatable rafts,

14:29.956 --> 14:31.522
and SR-2 survival vests.

14:31.566 --> 14:34.308
Wow. The Navy
thinks of everything.

14:34.351 --> 14:36.310
Yup.

14:37.659 --> 14:41.445
Hey, man, I just
wanted to say, uh,

14:41.489 --> 14:44.579
I'm sorry about making such
a big deal about your surgery.

14:46.189 --> 14:47.843
I'm sure it's
gonna be fine.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.106
Appreciate that.

14:50.150 --> 14:53.675
I just think it's weird, man.
I'm just thinking about somebody

14:53.718 --> 14:55.329
messing around down
there, you know?

14:55.372 --> 14:58.201
Remember that
movie, um...

14:58.245 --> 15:00.682
Edward Scissorhands?

15:00.725 --> 15:03.250
Why would you put that image
in my head?I'm just saying

15:03.293 --> 15:04.512
that's the image
in my head.

15:04.555 --> 15:05.861
Well, now it's
in my head, okay?

15:05.905 --> 15:08.298
What's in your head?

15:08.342 --> 15:10.257
Oh, great. [chuckles]
You guys made it.

15:10.300 --> 15:12.737
Yeah. Ship was in Norfolk,
we drove straight here.

15:12.781 --> 15:14.261
Talk to me, McGee.

15:14.304 --> 15:16.393
Well, Navy pinpoints
the crash site at about

15:16.437 --> 15:18.830
4.2 miles southeast
of here.

15:18.874 --> 15:20.310
Kasie and I took a look
at the tide charts,

15:20.354 --> 15:22.834
guesstimate the
lieutenant came ashore

15:22.878 --> 15:24.097
right around this
stretch of the beach.

15:24.140 --> 15:26.664
Assuming she survived
the ejection.

15:26.708 --> 15:28.318
She survived.

15:34.455 --> 15:36.457
Something was dragged
through here.

15:49.687 --> 15:51.951
Yeah, here's the flight suit.

15:53.909 --> 15:55.302
Oh, still damp.

15:55.345 --> 15:57.695
Here's a survival vest,

15:57.739 --> 16:00.872
flares,
smoke signals, unused.

16:00.916 --> 16:02.526
She didn't want
to attract attention.

16:02.570 --> 16:04.137
Yeah, which is why
she buried everything.

16:04.180 --> 16:05.790
Not everything.

16:05.834 --> 16:07.444
Supposed to be a Glock
in that vest.

16:07.488 --> 16:08.968
All right, now she's got a gun.

16:09.011 --> 16:11.187
Uh, I've got a map
of the area--

16:11.231 --> 16:14.190
closest town is four miles away.

16:14.234 --> 16:16.236
Likely on foot.
Where's the nearest structure?

16:16.279 --> 16:18.238
Stand by.

16:18.281 --> 16:20.066
Okay, so there's
a bait and tackle shop

16:20.109 --> 16:22.285
half a mile
up the road.

16:24.592 --> 16:26.724
Hey, Nick, you're with me.

16:26.768 --> 16:30.641
McGee, Bishop,
check out the area.

16:30.685 --> 16:33.644
You got it, boss.

16:33.688 --> 16:36.256
Well, I don't see any
security cameras anywhere.

16:38.780 --> 16:40.608
What?

16:40.651 --> 16:43.393
You okay?Well, yeah. Why?

16:43.437 --> 16:45.656
I heard you and Torres

16:45.700 --> 16:47.658
whispering about surgery.

16:47.702 --> 16:49.269
Oh, geez. No.

16:49.312 --> 16:52.315
It's-it-it-it's so not
a big deal. It's nothing.

16:52.359 --> 16:55.014
I appreciate
your concern, Bishop,

16:55.057 --> 16:57.103
okay? But...No buts, okay?

16:57.146 --> 17:00.019
You can't tell Torres and
not me. I've known you longer.

17:01.063 --> 17:03.022
You're right.

17:04.806 --> 17:08.331
I'm getting a procedure
done, okay?

17:08.375 --> 17:11.378
An elective operation...

17:13.162 --> 17:16.905
...to rectify a situation

17:16.948 --> 17:19.473
with, um...

17:21.040 --> 17:24.652
I'm gonna go look over there
for a second.

17:24.695 --> 17:28.047
Oh...

17:28.090 --> 17:29.222
Oh.

17:29.265 --> 17:31.876
Hey, McGee.

17:31.920 --> 17:33.661
MAN:
Yep. She was here, all right.

17:33.704 --> 17:36.403
You talk to her, Mr. Douglas?

17:36.446 --> 17:39.623
Ah, you call me Bobby Dale.
Uh, yeah, we spoke.

17:39.667 --> 17:41.799
Um, nice young lady.

17:41.843 --> 17:43.975
She... little
bit strange.

17:44.019 --> 17:47.283
Strange how?Poor thing was cold and wet.

17:47.327 --> 17:50.199
Said she went swimming
in the ocean, you believe that?

17:50.243 --> 17:51.766
This time of year.

17:51.809 --> 17:53.159
She come alone?

17:53.202 --> 17:54.899
[clears throat]
Yep. Alone

17:54.943 --> 17:57.685
and on foot.
Told you, strange.

17:57.728 --> 17:59.165
I didn't know she was
military, otherwise

17:59.208 --> 18:00.644
I'd have given
her a discount.

18:00.688 --> 18:01.993
What'd she buy?

18:02.037 --> 18:03.517
Oh, she bought herself a jacket,

18:03.560 --> 18:06.476
of course, and then,
um, some snacks,

18:06.520 --> 18:10.306
a local map, uh, couple other
things. Tell me, what'd she do

18:10.350 --> 18:13.004
to get herself
caught up in NCIS?

18:13.048 --> 18:15.311
That one.

18:15.355 --> 18:18.880
What else she buy?Um, well, she bought herself

18:18.923 --> 18:20.664
a flathead
screwdriver,

18:20.708 --> 18:23.014
copper wire, and
electrical tape.

18:23.058 --> 18:24.973
Huh. Uh-oh.

18:25.016 --> 18:26.670
What, "uh-oh"?

18:26.714 --> 18:28.281
You happen to drive
a motorcycle?

18:28.324 --> 18:31.153
Yeah, how the hell
did you know that?

18:31.197 --> 18:33.721
I caused a lot of trouble with
those three things as a kid.

18:39.901 --> 18:43.165
Oh, come on, man.

18:43.209 --> 18:45.167
What'd we miss?

18:45.211 --> 18:46.951
Weeks was here.

18:48.388 --> 18:50.259
She hot-wired his motorcycle.

18:56.744 --> 19:00.182
Checkpoints at five-mile
intervals on Highway 12.

19:00.226 --> 19:03.533
All bridges from the Outer Banks
to the mainland shut down.

19:03.577 --> 19:06.057
Yes, sir.Your fugitive
is a murder suspect,

19:06.101 --> 19:07.537
armed with a Glock

19:07.581 --> 19:10.236
and riding a red
Honda SR-400 motorcycle.

19:10.279 --> 19:12.803
Her name is Lieutenant
Rebecca Weeks.

19:12.847 --> 19:14.327
Got it.Sir? Secretary Leo.

19:14.370 --> 19:16.764
I'll be with her in a moment.

19:16.807 --> 19:18.461
She's trapped
on an island, Colonel.

19:18.505 --> 19:20.289
I expect North Carolina
Highway Patrol

19:20.333 --> 19:21.856
to make sure she stays there.

19:21.899 --> 19:23.336
We'll find her.

19:23.379 --> 19:25.729
Madam Undersecretary,
thank you for waiting.

19:25.773 --> 19:28.950
Director.
I thought this pilot was dead.

19:28.993 --> 19:31.213
That's exactly what she
wanted us to think, ma'am.

19:31.257 --> 19:34.303
Turns out she ejected
before the plane crashed.

19:34.347 --> 19:37.524
Which means she used a
$60 million government warplane

19:37.567 --> 19:39.134
as her personal getaway vehicle.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.744
It appears so.

19:40.788 --> 19:43.878
Is this connected in any way
to the murdered petty officer

19:43.921 --> 19:44.966
from the ship?

19:45.009 --> 19:46.663
She's our number-one
suspect, ma'am.

19:46.707 --> 19:48.535
Well, it's one big damn mess.

19:48.578 --> 19:51.538
And we'll clean it up, ma'am.
Our people are closing in.

19:51.581 --> 19:53.496
I should have her
in custody very soon.

19:54.671 --> 19:57.152
Call me the minute you do.Will do.

19:58.675 --> 20:00.155
I like your
confidence, Leon.

20:00.199 --> 20:03.245
Fake it till you make it, Jack.
What do you got?

20:03.289 --> 20:06.335
The lieutenant's file. I think
I know where she's going next.

20:06.379 --> 20:07.728
Bring it.

20:07.771 --> 20:11.166
She needs an ally, right?
Someone she can trust.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.950
But she's from Tennessee,

20:12.994 --> 20:14.996
and she's trapped in the
Outer Banks of North Carolina.

20:15.039 --> 20:16.432
Right,

20:16.476 --> 20:18.434
but when she applied
for officer candidate school,

20:18.478 --> 20:21.350
she submitted a letter
of character from her godfather,

20:21.394 --> 20:24.527
a former Navy pilot himself.
And guess where he lives.

20:24.571 --> 20:27.443
The Outer Banks of
North Carolina. I'll call Gibbs.

20:27.487 --> 20:29.619
I already did.

20:29.663 --> 20:31.491
Well done, Jack.

20:46.810 --> 20:49.509
Can I help you folks?Where is she?

20:50.553 --> 20:53.295
Well, good afternoon
to you, too.

20:53.339 --> 20:54.731
Not really.

20:54.775 --> 20:56.907
Maybe we should start
with introductions.

20:56.951 --> 20:58.126
My name is Jack...

20:58.169 --> 21:00.171
Navy Lieutenant Commander
Jack Briggs,

21:00.215 --> 21:01.477
retired.

21:01.521 --> 21:03.871
Special Agent Bishop,
this is Gibbs, McGee,

21:03.914 --> 21:05.525
and that is Torres.

21:05.568 --> 21:07.440
We have reason to believe
that your goddaughter,

21:07.483 --> 21:09.964
Lieutenant Rebecca Weeks,
is on your property.

21:10.007 --> 21:13.489
My, oh, my, you seem to
have brought the whole posse.

21:13.533 --> 21:16.318
Well, you can search
the house, th...

21:16.362 --> 21:19.495
there's fresh
lemonade in there.

21:19.539 --> 21:21.976
You can help yourself
to it if you've a mind.

21:22.019 --> 21:24.674
Commander Briggs.
Is she here or not?

21:24.718 --> 21:27.677
She was here.
Now she's gone.

21:27.721 --> 21:29.200
Where?

21:29.244 --> 21:33.030
I didn't ask.
And she didn't say.

21:33.074 --> 21:34.771
Well, she's not
gonna get far.

21:34.815 --> 21:36.469
Every road off this island

21:36.512 --> 21:37.687
is blocked.

21:38.732 --> 21:40.037
TORRES:
Hey, Gibbs?

21:40.081 --> 21:41.256
She's still here.

21:43.258 --> 21:45.608
You're not gonna
catch her, you know.

21:45.652 --> 21:47.349
She's way too smart.

21:49.220 --> 21:50.700
Check the house.

21:52.398 --> 21:54.704
You know lying to federal agents
is a crime?

21:54.748 --> 21:58.055
Well, son, I'll tell you,
I don't give a hot damn.

21:58.099 --> 22:00.536
She's innocent. She didn't
kill her boyfriend.

22:00.580 --> 22:03.452
And if you want to arrest me...

22:03.496 --> 22:04.584
then arrest me.

22:07.238 --> 22:09.240
[chuckles]
Great.

22:09.284 --> 22:11.634
I didn't have much else
to do today.

22:11.678 --> 22:12.679
Put him in the car.

22:14.420 --> 22:15.725
[engine starting]

22:15.769 --> 22:17.814
Uh, what is that?

22:17.858 --> 22:20.904
[engine humming]That is why Rebecca
came here today.

22:20.948 --> 22:22.428
Stay with him.

22:51.587 --> 22:53.720
Yes, Madam Secretary,
we thought

22:53.763 --> 22:56.244
we had her surrounded.
Uh, she...

22:57.550 --> 22:59.682
Have we found the plane yet?

22:59.726 --> 23:01.858
Uh, not yet.
But, uh, she didn't exactly

23:01.902 --> 23:03.599
leave a flight plan, so...

23:03.643 --> 23:07.429
You have a nice day, too.

23:07.473 --> 23:10.606
She didn't really say
"Have a nice day," did she?

23:10.650 --> 23:12.608
So where's our pilot,
Agent McGee?

23:12.652 --> 23:14.262
And please don't say
you don't know.

23:14.305 --> 23:17.265
Well, what we do know
is the maximum range

23:17.308 --> 23:20.311
of the aircraft, given a
full tank, is about 700 miles.

23:20.355 --> 23:23.097
So we're talking anywhere
from east of the Mississippi

23:23.140 --> 23:24.577
to where she grew up
in Tennessee?

23:24.620 --> 23:27.971
Yeah. We've notified
the FAA, put a BOLO out

23:28.015 --> 23:29.451
at all the private airfields,

23:29.495 --> 23:31.453
so when the plane
lands, we will know.

23:31.497 --> 23:33.586
And her godfather isn't talking?

23:33.629 --> 23:35.631
Well, Gibbs and Bishop
decided to stay back

23:35.675 --> 23:37.764
in North Carolina,
see what he has to say,

23:37.807 --> 23:40.114
but so far he just keeps saying
she's innocent.

23:40.157 --> 23:42.072
Oh, innocent people
don't steal motorcycles

23:42.116 --> 23:43.465
and commandeer planes.

23:43.509 --> 23:45.162
If she didn't
kill her boyfriend,

23:45.206 --> 23:46.773
why is she running?

23:46.816 --> 23:50.124
Yeah. All right,
is that it, Director?

23:51.168 --> 23:52.518
No.

23:52.561 --> 23:54.433
Please close the door.

24:01.657 --> 24:05.444
Agent McGee, um,
have you...

24:07.533 --> 24:10.274
Have you been discussing

24:10.318 --> 24:13.321
your private
medical decisions at work?

24:14.365 --> 24:16.585
W... Uh... once.

24:16.629 --> 24:18.326
I brought it up.

24:18.369 --> 24:21.895
It was actually more
like three times. Um...

24:21.938 --> 24:24.593
counting now.
This-This is the fifth time.

24:24.637 --> 24:26.508
Please don't bring it up again.

24:26.552 --> 24:29.903
Understood. Sorry.

24:29.946 --> 24:32.819
It's just, um...

24:34.777 --> 24:36.953
[chuckling]: No...
[mutters]

24:36.997 --> 24:38.607
Agent McGee?

24:40.653 --> 24:42.132
You're gonna be fine.

24:42.176 --> 24:44.091
A little discomfort

24:44.134 --> 24:46.963
for a few days, but then
you'll be back in the saddle.

24:47.007 --> 24:49.357
Wait, you...

24:49.400 --> 24:50.750
Mm-hmm.

24:50.793 --> 24:53.013
Oh, my God, that is
such a relief to hear.

24:53.056 --> 24:54.797
Wow, did-did you do

24:54.841 --> 24:57.147
the, the non-scalpel method
or-or with the scalpel?

24:57.191 --> 25:00.673
Both.W... Y... Why'd
you do it twice?

25:01.891 --> 25:04.154
My boys went down swinging.

25:04.198 --> 25:07.941
Oh, my. Wow, how'd you find out
it didn't work the first time?

25:07.984 --> 25:10.596
When Jackie got pregnant
with our son.

25:10.639 --> 25:13.294
Jared was an oops?Yep.

25:13.337 --> 25:15.035
Best mistake we ever made.

25:18.299 --> 25:19.256
We found the plane.

25:19.300 --> 25:20.562
Where?
In Tennessee?

25:20.606 --> 25:23.260
Not even close.

25:23.304 --> 25:24.784
Fairfield, North Carolina,

25:24.827 --> 25:26.742
and she landed on a small
airstrip about an hour ago.

25:26.786 --> 25:27.917
Any sign of the lieutenant?

25:27.961 --> 25:29.615
A mechanic saw her land,

25:29.658 --> 25:32.226
but by the time he saw our
BOLO, she was long gone.

25:32.269 --> 25:33.706
All right, uh,
Fairfield--

25:33.749 --> 25:35.577
we can be there
in about an hour.

25:35.621 --> 25:37.274
I'll tell the mechanic
you're on your way.

25:38.798 --> 25:40.756
So, she had a plane.

25:40.800 --> 25:42.279
She could have flown anywhere.

25:42.323 --> 25:43.846
Why a tiny town

25:43.890 --> 25:46.588
30 miles away
from where she took off?

25:46.632 --> 25:48.721
[phone rings]

25:48.764 --> 25:51.158
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

25:51.201 --> 25:53.247
Hello?

25:53.290 --> 25:54.553
WEEKS:
Is this the agent

25:54.596 --> 25:57.556
I saw at my godfather's house?

25:59.340 --> 26:00.602
Weeks?

26:00.646 --> 26:02.125
Yeah.

26:03.910 --> 26:05.346
Thanks for not shooting me.

26:07.696 --> 26:09.872
I probably would've missed.

26:09.916 --> 26:11.874
How'd you get this number?

26:11.918 --> 26:14.224
I called your office.
They transferred me.

26:14.268 --> 26:16.662
I didn't kill Fisher.

26:16.705 --> 26:18.533
GIBBS:
Uh, okay.

26:18.577 --> 26:20.840
Tell me what happened.

26:20.883 --> 26:23.059
I got a couple things
to do first.

26:23.103 --> 26:25.322
In Fairfield?

26:25.366 --> 26:26.715
You found the plane.

26:27.934 --> 26:30.589
Well, you knew we would.

26:30.632 --> 26:32.068
What are you doing in Fairfield?

26:32.112 --> 26:33.766
Your job.

26:35.419 --> 26:37.421
Yeah?
What job is that?

26:41.251 --> 26:42.688
Weeks?

26:42.731 --> 26:45.212
[sighs]Hello. Weeks,
you still here?

26:45.255 --> 26:47.736
Nah, she ended the call
before we could trace it.

26:49.042 --> 26:50.609
No, line's still open.
She never hung up.

26:53.612 --> 26:56.527
She wants us to trace the call.

26:56.571 --> 27:00.227
So I come back from dinner,
I find my front door

27:00.270 --> 27:01.881
bashed open,

27:01.924 --> 27:03.839
and my paperwork
all over the place.

27:03.883 --> 27:06.189
She didn't find
the cashbox,

27:06.233 --> 27:09.105
but she did find these keys
and took one.

27:09.149 --> 27:10.454
And she walked out the door.

27:10.498 --> 27:13.980
You want to see the
rest, uh, be my guest.

27:14.023 --> 27:16.069
Here.

27:17.200 --> 27:18.941
All right.
There she goes.

27:18.985 --> 27:22.858
She gets into that car.
Puts it in reverse,

27:22.902 --> 27:24.773
and backs right into
my tow truck.

27:24.817 --> 27:26.296
Thanks very much, lady.

27:26.340 --> 27:27.950
Then she puts
it in drive,

27:27.994 --> 27:29.691
guns the engine,

27:29.735 --> 27:32.172
and crashes right
through my front gate.

27:32.215 --> 27:34.522
This kind of crap
is why I left New Jersey.

27:34.565 --> 27:36.306
Who's car was that?

27:36.350 --> 27:38.047
Some guy with
too many parking tickets.

27:38.091 --> 27:39.309
I impounded it yesterday.

27:39.353 --> 27:42.008
Okay, I don't get it.

27:42.051 --> 27:44.793
She trades in her plane
for a car

27:44.837 --> 27:46.795
that she breaks into
a junkyard to steal,

27:46.839 --> 27:49.885
and then she leads us here?

27:49.929 --> 27:51.278
Hey, I-I didn't
touch that phone,

27:51.321 --> 27:53.019
if you're gonna dust for
fingerprints or something.

27:53.062 --> 27:55.325
Oh, no, thank you.
We-we already know who it is.

27:55.369 --> 27:56.718
You do?Mm.

27:56.762 --> 27:58.677
Oh, you guys are good.

27:58.720 --> 28:00.809
Hey, tell her
to bring back that car.

28:00.853 --> 28:02.506
It's not about the Subaru.

28:02.550 --> 28:06.249
Rewind the video. Find out what
else she did while she was here.

28:06.293 --> 28:08.817
What? Breaking and entering
is not enough for you two?

28:08.861 --> 28:10.863
Right there.
Play it.

28:12.081 --> 28:14.083
What's she doing?

28:14.127 --> 28:16.085
She's taking

28:16.129 --> 28:18.000
something from under the hood.

28:19.132 --> 28:21.003
I can't make out
what it is.

28:21.047 --> 28:22.701
Whose car is that?

28:22.744 --> 28:25.312
I don't know.
She stole the paperwork.

28:25.355 --> 28:26.400
Well, try
to remember.

28:27.488 --> 28:28.794
That's a junker.

28:28.837 --> 28:30.273
Brought it in last month.

28:30.317 --> 28:32.885
Some driver wrapped it
around a tree. It's worthless.

28:32.928 --> 28:35.017
Not worthless to her.

28:35.061 --> 28:36.627
Hey. Are you guys
hearing me?

28:36.671 --> 28:39.848
I really don't care
about that piece of junk.

28:39.892 --> 28:42.329
What about the Subaru
that she drove off in?

28:42.372 --> 28:43.765
And the hole
in my gate?

28:43.809 --> 28:45.767
And what about the dent
in my tow truck?

28:45.811 --> 28:48.291
Get that car
back to NCIS.

28:48.335 --> 28:50.119
Find out what she took and why.

28:50.163 --> 28:53.383
Gladly, all we need's
a tow truck.

28:53.427 --> 28:55.821
You got to be
kidding me, right?

29:02.828 --> 29:04.481
Kasie?

29:04.525 --> 29:05.831
KASIE:
Under here.

29:10.661 --> 29:12.054
You find out what the pilot...

29:12.098 --> 29:13.577
Damn, what happened here?

29:13.621 --> 29:15.405
This is what happens
to a junkyard car.

29:15.449 --> 29:17.538
It's raided for parts.

29:17.581 --> 29:20.759
But what part did Weeks
actually steal?

29:20.802 --> 29:21.934
Exactly.

29:21.977 --> 29:24.588
But... I have persevered,

29:24.632 --> 29:27.026
and watched that surveillance
video 47 times,

29:27.069 --> 29:29.898
and I think I figured it out.

29:29.942 --> 29:31.770
She took the engine
control system.

29:31.813 --> 29:33.641
All right, pretend I
don't know what that is.

29:33.684 --> 29:34.816
Thought you were
a gearhead.

29:34.860 --> 29:37.036
Classic cars only.Ah.

29:37.079 --> 29:39.908
Well, the ECS is the car's
onboard computer system.

29:39.952 --> 29:41.257
It allows its
various electronics

29:41.301 --> 29:42.737
to talk to each other.

29:42.781 --> 29:44.783
All right, but why would
a killer break into a junkyard

29:44.826 --> 29:46.785
to steal that?

29:46.828 --> 29:49.875
I don't know. But I know why
she was interested in this car.

29:49.918 --> 29:51.093
You ran the VIN number?

29:51.137 --> 29:53.574
I did. The last owner
was a Navy commander

29:53.617 --> 29:56.446
named Marshall May.

29:56.490 --> 29:57.752
That's Weeks' CO.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.232
The one and only.

29:59.275 --> 30:01.756
Well, he got into
a terrible wreck.Uh, wasn't him.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.671
He was deployed at the time
at the time of the accident.

30:03.714 --> 30:05.934
His wife Jill was driving.

30:05.978 --> 30:06.979
Is she okay?

30:07.022 --> 30:08.545
No. She died.

30:10.330 --> 30:13.855
McGEE:
Oh, this is making
my head hurt. Okay.

30:13.899 --> 30:17.424
Why is Weeks digging into
her CO's wife's death?

30:17.467 --> 30:19.643
Well, when she called Gibbs

30:19.687 --> 30:21.123
and said she was
doing our job,

30:21.167 --> 30:23.647
maybe this is the job
she was talking about.

30:23.691 --> 30:24.953
Job's already done, though.

30:24.997 --> 30:26.955
We have a police report
in here that says

30:26.999 --> 30:28.652
the car crash
was an accident.

30:28.696 --> 30:30.263
Maybe Weeks doesn't agree.

30:30.306 --> 30:33.179
What is she doing, conducting
her own investigation?

30:33.222 --> 30:35.659
While she's already
on the run for murder?

30:35.703 --> 30:37.183
Well, what's
to investigate?

30:37.226 --> 30:39.881
"Driver lost control of
vehicle and sideswiped a tree,

30:39.925 --> 30:42.101
killing her instantly."

30:42.144 --> 30:44.973
It says it was
a one-car accident.

30:45.017 --> 30:47.671
That thing that Weeks
took from the car.

30:47.715 --> 30:49.848
The engine control system.Yeah, wha-what

30:49.891 --> 30:51.327
does that do, McGee?Well, the ECS

30:51.371 --> 30:52.851
is the brains of the vehicle.

30:52.894 --> 30:54.983
It controls
everything electronic,

30:55.027 --> 30:58.030
the air conditioning,
radio, power steering.

30:58.073 --> 30:59.335
Power steering.

30:59.379 --> 31:00.946
What about the brakes?

31:00.989 --> 31:02.512
Sure. Why?

31:02.556 --> 31:06.038
In the police report,
it says there was no skid marks.

31:06.081 --> 31:08.605
What are you thinking,
the ECS failed?

31:08.649 --> 31:10.477
Or someone made it fail.

31:10.520 --> 31:13.132
The ECS is a computer,
and computers can be hacked.

31:13.175 --> 31:14.785
So I saw
this thing

31:14.829 --> 31:17.527
online last week
where two high school students

31:17.571 --> 31:19.268
hacked their
principal's car

31:19.312 --> 31:21.009
and drove it onto
the football field.

31:21.053 --> 31:23.577
Maybe Weeks thinks the
commander's car got hacked.

31:23.620 --> 31:25.492
She took the ECS to prove it.

31:25.535 --> 31:28.060
Uh, uh, this
is all speculation.

31:28.103 --> 31:30.497
And let's not forget
we're talking about a woman

31:30.540 --> 31:31.541
who killed her boyfriend,

31:31.585 --> 31:33.065
crashed a plane

31:33.108 --> 31:34.196
and then faked her own death.

31:34.240 --> 31:35.458
Let's go get her.

31:35.502 --> 31:36.590
Got a hit on the Subaru

31:36.633 --> 31:38.635
she stole from the junkyard.

31:38.679 --> 31:39.810
Where's it at, boss?

31:39.854 --> 31:42.074
Norfolk.
Pier 90.

31:42.117 --> 31:44.250
Wha... That's where the
aircraft carrier's docked.

31:44.293 --> 31:47.079
Why would a killer return
to the scene of the crime?

31:47.122 --> 31:48.950
Maybe she's not done killing.

31:48.994 --> 31:50.256
GIBBS:
McGee, notify the captain.

31:50.299 --> 31:52.301
Warn him about Weeks.

32:00.092 --> 32:01.397
CAPTAIN:
Agent Gibbs.

32:01.441 --> 32:03.617
Captain.
Any sign of Lieutenant Weeks?

32:03.660 --> 32:05.488
No. Thank you
for the warning,

32:05.532 --> 32:07.099
but we don't believe
she boarded. This way.

32:07.142 --> 32:08.839
TORRES:
She could have boarded
before we called you.

32:08.883 --> 32:10.667
Unlikely.
Her ID was tagged.

32:10.711 --> 32:12.191
We would have been notified.

32:12.234 --> 32:14.889
Well, we've discovered
she's quite resourceful.

32:14.933 --> 32:16.369
Which is why
we locked down the ship.

32:16.412 --> 32:17.979
All sailors are confined
to their quarters.

32:18.023 --> 32:19.372
No one on or off.

32:19.415 --> 32:21.156
Do you have that list
we requested?

32:21.200 --> 32:23.463
Yes.
Everyone who swiped

32:23.506 --> 32:25.117
their ID in the past 12 hours.

32:25.160 --> 32:27.032
Thanks.[knocking]

32:27.075 --> 32:28.424
CAPTAIN:
Commander May.

32:29.730 --> 32:31.384
He knows we want to talk to him?

32:31.427 --> 32:33.255
I told him myself.

32:35.605 --> 32:37.346
Commander May,
this is the captain.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.881
Are you sure he was in here?

32:50.925 --> 32:52.579
I just talked to him.
He was sitting right there,

32:52.622 --> 32:53.928
working on his laptop.

32:53.972 --> 32:55.364
Now they're both gone.

32:55.408 --> 32:56.670
Hey, Gibbs, take a look at this.

32:56.713 --> 32:58.411
So Petty Officer
Sandra Stevens

32:58.454 --> 33:01.588
boarded right before the ship
was locked down.

33:01.631 --> 33:03.155
I'm calling him.

33:03.198 --> 33:05.070
She looks a lot like Weeks.Which got me curious

33:05.113 --> 33:07.072
enough to look her up.

33:07.115 --> 33:10.989
According to Stevens' ESR, she's
on medical leave in San Diego.

33:11.032 --> 33:12.599
McGEE:
Weeks posed as Stevens.

33:12.642 --> 33:13.992
She's on board.

33:14.035 --> 33:15.950
Call went straight
to voice mail.

33:15.994 --> 33:18.648
We can find them. Officers can
search every compartment.

33:18.692 --> 33:20.302
We don't have that kind of time.

33:20.346 --> 33:22.261
His laptop-- can you trace it?

33:22.304 --> 33:25.307
The ship's Wi-Fi was shut down.
We need 20 minutes to reboot.

33:25.351 --> 33:26.482
I know another way.

33:26.526 --> 33:29.442
But it'll take an
electromagnetic sensor

33:29.485 --> 33:30.660
configured to look
for a Bluetooth signal.

33:30.704 --> 33:32.314
Do it.Yep.

33:34.142 --> 33:35.883
WEEKS:
Come on, Commander.
We're running out of time.

33:35.926 --> 33:38.016
MAY:
Weeks, please.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.629
Weeks.

33:42.672 --> 33:44.544
Hi, Agent Gibbs.

33:44.587 --> 33:46.850
Don't do it.

33:46.894 --> 33:48.156
You're early.

33:48.200 --> 33:50.028
I don't have his password yet.

33:53.248 --> 33:56.034
Lieutenant.
I need you to drop your weapon.

33:56.077 --> 33:58.601
Not until I have his password.

34:00.212 --> 34:02.344
Here's the engine control
system.

34:02.388 --> 34:04.172
It proves that his
wife's car was hacked.

34:04.216 --> 34:07.001
Now all I need is his password
to prove that he did it.

34:07.045 --> 34:08.307
How dare you say that?

34:08.350 --> 34:09.482
Jill had an accident.

34:09.525 --> 34:11.092
Then give me your damn password.

34:12.746 --> 34:15.053
Get back.

34:16.880 --> 34:19.231
Don't come any closer.

34:24.801 --> 34:27.065
I am putting my weapon down,
Lieutenant.

34:28.631 --> 34:29.719
Gibbs.

34:31.678 --> 34:34.072
It's okay, McGee.

34:34.115 --> 34:36.509
It is okay.

34:38.250 --> 34:40.556
Got a predicament, Lieutenant.

34:40.600 --> 34:42.689
You shoot me,

34:42.732 --> 34:46.127
Agent McGee shoots you,

34:46.171 --> 34:49.304
neither one of us are gonna know
what's on that laptop.

34:52.960 --> 34:54.962
It's your choice.

35:14.373 --> 35:15.939
MAY:
She's lost it.

35:15.983 --> 35:17.941
She's a lunatic.
You saw her.

35:17.985 --> 35:20.248
I thought you said she
was your best pilot.

35:20.292 --> 35:22.163
And a family friend.

35:22.207 --> 35:23.773
That was before she aimed
a gun at my head

35:23.817 --> 35:25.775
and accused me of murder.

35:25.819 --> 35:27.212
WEEKS:
Agent Gibbs,

35:27.255 --> 35:29.649
did you check
the commander's laptop?

35:32.086 --> 35:33.609
We're looking into it.

35:33.653 --> 35:36.438
He killed his wife.

35:36.482 --> 35:39.615
He took control of her car
and he crashed it.

35:39.659 --> 35:42.749
MAY:
No. That's crazy.

35:42.792 --> 35:45.578
Losing my wife
was the hardest thing

35:45.621 --> 35:47.188
I've had to live through.

35:47.232 --> 35:50.757
I did not kill her.

35:50.800 --> 35:53.063
Your laptop did.

35:53.107 --> 35:56.241
We tested it. You used it
to hack into your wife's car.

35:56.284 --> 35:57.764
No.Yes.

35:57.807 --> 36:00.070
You disabled the brakes, you
took control of the steering

36:00.114 --> 36:01.463
and drove her
into a tree.

36:01.507 --> 36:02.943
Why would I ever do that?

36:02.986 --> 36:05.946
They were having
marital problems. Big ones.

36:05.989 --> 36:07.948
Jill told me
so herself.

36:07.991 --> 36:10.342
We became friends
through the commander,

36:10.385 --> 36:13.345
and last month at dinner,
she confided in me that...

36:13.388 --> 36:17.000
he had been acting weird

36:17.044 --> 36:18.176
toward her.

36:18.219 --> 36:19.568
She said,

36:19.612 --> 36:22.397
"If I wind up dead,
my husband did it."

36:24.269 --> 36:26.445
And I thought she was joking.

36:27.707 --> 36:29.709
Until she ended up dead.

36:31.885 --> 36:34.496
Why didn't you contact NCIS?

36:34.540 --> 36:37.325
And accuse my CO of murder?

36:37.369 --> 36:40.198
He was on the ship
when she crashed.

36:40.241 --> 36:43.549
I thought it was
just an eerie coincidence.

36:43.592 --> 36:45.942
But then, the other night
on social media, I saw

36:45.986 --> 36:49.032
a group of high school kids
hacked their principal's car.

36:49.076 --> 36:51.121
I asked Fisher.

36:51.165 --> 36:53.820
Could the commander
have done something like that?

36:54.864 --> 36:56.997
He said he'd call NCIS.

36:57.040 --> 36:59.652
TORRES:
You found out that Petty
Officer Patrick was gonna

36:59.695 --> 37:01.523
report you to NCIS.

37:01.567 --> 37:03.699
So you had to kill him, too.

37:03.743 --> 37:07.181
No.
I didn't kill anyone.

37:07.225 --> 37:09.662
You knew Weeks was
prescribed oxycodone

37:09.705 --> 37:11.316
and kept it in her lockbox.

37:11.359 --> 37:13.840
And as CO,
you had the combination.

37:13.883 --> 37:15.276
This is insane.

37:15.320 --> 37:17.104
I never even met
the petty officer.

37:17.147 --> 37:19.846
The first time I ever saw him
was dead in Weeks' bunk.

37:19.889 --> 37:21.804
I found him in my bunk

37:21.848 --> 37:24.285
and I freaked out.

37:24.329 --> 37:27.201
I couldn't think,
I just...

37:27.245 --> 37:30.857
I got in the cockpit
and I took off.

37:30.900 --> 37:33.512
I was convinced that when
I landed back on the ship,

37:33.555 --> 37:36.471
I'd be arrested or killed.

37:36.515 --> 37:40.214
So you ditched the airplane.

37:40.258 --> 37:43.261
At that point,
I couldn't call NCIS.

37:44.871 --> 37:48.048
Not until I proved my theory.

37:48.091 --> 37:50.050
So I found Jill's car,

37:50.093 --> 37:52.531
I took her engine control
system, I tested it,

37:52.574 --> 37:54.359
and it was hacked.

37:54.402 --> 37:57.666
And the hack traced back
to the ship's IP address.

37:57.710 --> 37:59.364
The commander.

37:59.407 --> 38:01.844
I loved my wife.

38:01.888 --> 38:04.717
Sure, we were having problems,
but I would never...

38:07.894 --> 38:09.809
Oh, my God.

38:09.852 --> 38:12.725
Something you want to share?

38:12.768 --> 38:15.031
Oh... oh, my God.

38:16.424 --> 38:18.557
Commander.

38:18.600 --> 38:21.255
She used my computer.

38:21.299 --> 38:24.606
And she knows Weeks'
lockbox combo.

38:25.955 --> 38:27.957
Who is she?

38:30.656 --> 38:32.005
Agent Bishop.

38:32.048 --> 38:33.485
Am I interrupting?

38:33.528 --> 38:35.400
Just work.
Come in.

38:35.443 --> 38:37.271
Of course.

38:37.315 --> 38:40.100
You're a weapons
systems officer.

38:40.143 --> 38:42.102
You can work
from anywhere.

38:42.145 --> 38:45.801
All you need is a laptop
and an Internet connection.

38:45.845 --> 38:48.587
Yeah, I guess.Oh,

38:48.630 --> 38:51.416
don't be modest. I mean,
you program high tech avionics.

38:51.459 --> 38:55.028
Compared to that, the engine
control system on cars

38:55.071 --> 38:58.597
must be pretty easy
to hack into.

38:58.640 --> 39:00.599
Silence is a good plan.

39:00.642 --> 39:03.515
We'll let your love texts
do all the talking.

39:03.558 --> 39:05.517
"I don't want to
share you anymore."

39:05.560 --> 39:08.694
'When are you ending
it with her?"

39:08.737 --> 39:10.173
You tried to cover your tracks

39:10.217 --> 39:12.567
by using a self-destructing
messaging app,

39:12.611 --> 39:14.613
but the commander saved a few.

39:16.266 --> 39:18.573
You know, he kept promising
he was gonna leave her.

39:18.617 --> 39:20.923
They never do.

39:20.967 --> 39:23.752
But he loves me.

39:23.796 --> 39:25.580
He wants me.

39:25.624 --> 39:27.713
Not after he figured
out that you used

39:27.756 --> 39:29.715
his laptop to hack
into his wife's car

39:29.758 --> 39:31.717
and drive it into a tree.

39:33.806 --> 39:34.981
Captain?

39:35.024 --> 39:38.071
I did this so that
we could be together.

39:38.114 --> 39:39.551
And you were,

39:39.594 --> 39:42.815
until your bunkmate Weeks
got suspicious,

39:42.858 --> 39:44.860
starting talking
to her boyfriend about it.

39:46.514 --> 39:48.690
So you poisoned him
and you framed her.

40:02.138 --> 40:03.749
Up here.

40:07.361 --> 40:09.581
Boss, someone here to see you.

40:09.624 --> 40:11.234
Lieutenant Weeks.

40:11.278 --> 40:12.453
WEEKS:
Agent Gibbs.

40:12.497 --> 40:14.760
I'm heading to my court-martial.

40:14.803 --> 40:16.196
I wanted to say thank you

40:16.239 --> 40:18.894
for offering to testify
on my behalf.

40:18.938 --> 40:20.592
Hope it helps.

40:20.635 --> 40:23.551
Anything helps explain why
I dumped a government warplane

40:23.595 --> 40:25.205
into the ocean.

40:25.248 --> 40:27.860
I don't think "I'm sorry"
is going to cut it.

40:29.427 --> 40:31.907
All you can do is go in there
and tell the truth.

40:31.951 --> 40:34.780
Thank you.
I will.

40:35.824 --> 40:37.435
Hey, Weeks?

40:39.175 --> 40:41.830
Thanks for not shooting me.

40:43.005 --> 40:44.964
I probably would have missed.

40:56.454 --> 40:59.805
10:00, McGee.
Don't you have someplace to be?

41:00.849 --> 41:02.547
Boss, you know about that?

41:03.765 --> 41:05.724
Hell, everybody
knows about that.

41:06.768 --> 41:08.770
Well, then, I guess I better go.

41:10.598 --> 41:13.209
If I could, uh,
just get my feet to move.

41:13.253 --> 41:14.472
[chuckles]

41:15.473 --> 41:17.126
What are you worried about?

41:18.171 --> 41:21.261
Well, just...

41:21.304 --> 41:23.959
I don't know.
What if something goes wrong?

41:25.178 --> 41:26.745
No, Tim.

41:26.788 --> 41:29.530
What are you worried about?

41:29.574 --> 41:31.401
Come on, boss.
What are you, Sloane now?

41:31.445 --> 41:32.968
[chuckles]

41:37.190 --> 41:38.887
I just...

41:38.931 --> 41:42.238
What if life
throws me a curveball?

41:42.282 --> 41:43.805
You know?

41:43.849 --> 41:47.635
I think you know more than
anyone what I'm talking about.

41:47.679 --> 41:50.595
I just... I don't want
to make a decision

41:50.638 --> 41:52.814
that I'm gonna regret
down the road.

41:52.858 --> 41:55.817
You made a decision today.

41:55.861 --> 41:58.211
Don't worry about tomorrow.

42:00.300 --> 42:02.607
It's easier to get past
than you think.

42:04.609 --> 42:06.828
Trust me.

42:06.872 --> 42:10.136
Wait, boss, you're a member
of the cut club?

42:10.179 --> 42:11.964
Oh, hell no.

42:12.007 --> 42:14.009
I wish you luck, though.
