WEBVTT

00:00.938 --> 00:03.906
You have an epidural hematoma.

00:04.867 --> 00:06.952
Do you know whose head you drilled into?

00:06.977 --> 00:08.312
I know who Doctor Bishop is.

00:08.337 --> 00:10.069
We have met before, of course.

00:10.094 --> 00:12.605
I interviewed you for a job,
but then didn't hire you.

00:12.630 --> 00:15.042
I think we need to do it again.

01:07.596 --> 01:09.441
Have you eaten anything?!

01:09.552 --> 01:11.523
I can't find my math book.

01:11.599 --> 01:13.125
It's over by the window.

01:13.150 --> 01:16.132
What if everything is
different at the hospital?

01:16.177 --> 01:19.015
Habibti, you're learning math
in a whole new language.

01:19.391 --> 01:21.125
I'll be fine.

01:35.133 --> 01:37.391
_

01:40.906 --> 01:42.992
_

01:43.017 --> 01:44.869
_

01:45.543 --> 01:48.013
I was waiting until I
was a doctor again.

02:33.811 --> 02:35.596
Sir, you need to get in line.

02:35.621 --> 02:37.404
I'm not a patient, I'm...

02:37.429 --> 02:39.602
We've got a trauma coming in!

02:39.627 --> 02:41.640
Tim Stafford, 35 years old.

02:41.665 --> 02:44.187
BP's 100 over 60. Pulse 150.

02:44.531 --> 02:45.828
Page Atwater.

02:45.877 --> 02:47.817
Construction site. Scaffolding collapse.

02:47.842 --> 02:49.613
Fell 20 feet. Landed
on a piece of rebar.

02:49.638 --> 02:51.250
We cut it off at the scene.

02:51.275 --> 02:53.742
Did he get anything for pain?

02:53.767 --> 02:54.774
You can't be here.

02:54.799 --> 02:56.399
If the rebar punctured
his femoral artery,

02:56.424 --> 02:58.374
- it could be potentially lethal.
- Yeah. I know that.

02:58.399 --> 02:59.539
- You got the hand?
- Got it.

02:59.564 --> 03:01.383
I got the leg. On three.
One, two, three.

03:01.408 --> 03:04.028
I need an X-ray plate.

03:04.053 --> 03:06.211
You can't just show up here
and volunteer as a doctor.

03:06.236 --> 03:07.441
I'm not.

03:07.466 --> 03:10.266
One, two, three.

03:10.681 --> 03:13.045
One, two, three.

03:13.394 --> 03:15.103
What the hell do you think you're doing?

03:15.128 --> 03:17.873
His job. Did you page vascular?

03:17.898 --> 03:19.586
They're on their way. OR needs five.

03:19.749 --> 03:21.478
Sir, do you know where you are?

03:21.503 --> 03:23.541
Please get that thing out of me!

03:23.566 --> 03:25.805
Not here. First we
have to stabilize you,

03:25.830 --> 03:27.380
then we'll get you down to the OR.

03:27.405 --> 03:29.407
100 mics fentanyl. IV push.

03:30.359 --> 03:32.538
The rebar may have hit
an important artery.

03:32.563 --> 03:34.483
Believe me, you don't want
it bleeding inside you.

03:34.508 --> 03:36.672
Dr. Leblanc is going
to tell us if it is.

03:36.697 --> 03:39.298
- X-ray's up!
- Femoral's great. Good pulses.

03:39.323 --> 03:41.571
It's your lucky day, sir.

03:44.049 --> 03:46.434
Not yet. He has a ruptured spleen.

03:47.750 --> 03:49.390
I'll do a scan.

03:58.640 --> 04:01.442
- He's right.
- Good. And?

04:01.467 --> 04:03.133
I'd do a splenectomy right now.

04:03.158 --> 04:04.656
Maybe five years ago. Not now.

04:04.681 --> 04:05.837
Dr. Curtis, tell him why.

04:05.862 --> 04:07.195
Because it will be jump at the gun.

04:07.220 --> 04:09.213
First we CT to find
out what grade it is.

04:09.238 --> 04:10.930
Dr. Leblanc? I can see
you're dying to tell us

04:10.955 --> 04:12.402
what happens pending that outcome?

04:12.427 --> 04:14.302
ICU and monitor, after the rebar's out.

04:15.029 --> 04:16.820
Get him to CT, stat!

04:17.197 --> 04:19.663
There are thousands of pages
of co-curricular reading

04:19.688 --> 04:21.344
and you'll need to catch up.

04:21.369 --> 04:23.303
And next time you come to
work, get changed first

04:23.328 --> 04:25.860
and find out where we
actually want you to be.

04:29.352 --> 04:32.165
You may remember Dr.
Hamed from two weeks ago

04:32.190 --> 04:34.110
when he drilled a hole in my head.

04:34.135 --> 04:36.370
He's one of you now.

04:58.214 --> 05:00.579
Welcome to the best
Emerge in the country.

05:01.939 --> 05:04.541
Triage nurses assign patients to acute,

05:04.566 --> 05:06.694
intermediate or ambulatory.

05:06.719 --> 05:08.405
Ambulatory's the busiest.

05:08.604 --> 05:10.970
Big waits, small problems, but for them,

05:10.995 --> 05:12.487
it's the worst day of their lives.

05:12.512 --> 05:14.301
They get a headache, go online,

05:14.326 --> 05:16.889
convince themselves
they've got a tumour.

05:16.914 --> 05:18.834
Acute's where the action is.

05:18.859 --> 05:22.592
Traumas, MIs, GSWs,

05:22.937 --> 05:25.487
stabbings, sepsis,

05:25.512 --> 05:27.856
strokes, overdoses.

05:28.804 --> 05:31.285
You were a trauma surgeon
already, but that was in Syria.

05:31.310 --> 05:33.714
In this teaching hospital,
you'll start at the bottom.

05:33.739 --> 05:35.532
Redo your residency,

05:35.557 --> 05:37.032
learn our system from scratch.

05:37.057 --> 05:38.946
- Questions so far?
- No, sir.

05:39.062 --> 05:41.434
I'm sure they'll have plenty for you.

05:44.225 --> 05:46.184
Okay, see you soon.

05:46.706 --> 05:48.429
Come on, then.

05:49.678 --> 05:51.442
Did you know we are hiring him?

05:51.467 --> 05:52.824
It's Dr. Bishop's prerogative.

05:52.849 --> 05:54.366
But I want him shadowing you today.

05:54.391 --> 05:56.170
And don't just do
everything yourself, Mags.

05:56.195 --> 05:58.077
I need to know what we're
getting with this guy.

05:58.102 --> 06:00.234
Dr. Wendy Atwater is your attending.

06:00.259 --> 06:02.688
All the residents report
to her, she reports to me.

06:02.713 --> 06:04.848
It's not every day a
patient from one week

06:04.873 --> 06:06.381
becomes a doctor the next.

06:06.406 --> 06:07.846
You'll get scrubs in the lounge,

06:07.871 --> 06:09.759
an ID card's in your mailbox.

06:09.784 --> 06:11.267
What happened in the trauma bay

06:11.292 --> 06:13.191
is not how the rest of
your day is going to go.

06:13.216 --> 06:16.203
You're gonna stick with Dr. Leblanc,
she's gonna teach you the rules.

06:16.228 --> 06:18.617
Scripts, decisions, it
all goes through her.

06:18.642 --> 06:20.547
- Understood?
- Mmm.

06:21.136 --> 06:23.662
Maybe don't show him where
we keep the power tools.

06:27.760 --> 06:29.827
- Hi.
- Who are you?

06:30.030 --> 06:33.595
I mean, clearly you have experience
and you did save Bishop's life.

06:33.620 --> 06:35.191
This is us moving on.

06:35.912 --> 06:37.864
Uh. Dr. Bishop...

06:37.889 --> 06:41.179
As Chief, does he always oversee
his patients like that?

06:41.204 --> 06:42.891
Whenever he feels like it, yeah.

06:42.916 --> 06:44.591
You're also an emergency resident?

06:44.616 --> 06:46.077
Second year. The ruptured spleen.

06:46.102 --> 06:47.287
How did you know without imaging?

06:47.312 --> 06:49.542
From the way the patient was
clenching his shoulder.

06:49.567 --> 06:51.433
Right. You trained in war
zones, I'm guessing.

06:51.458 --> 06:52.957
Not a lot of equipment or resources.

06:52.982 --> 06:55.631
Do you always just ask
whatever's on your mind?

06:55.656 --> 06:58.369
When I'm being asked to trust
somebody with my patients? Yeah.

06:59.444 --> 07:03.130
Practicing medicine in the dark,
you learn to sharpen other skills.

07:03.155 --> 07:05.021
Yeah, well here we
always rely on imaging.

07:05.046 --> 07:06.637
Oh. I'm sorry.

07:13.917 --> 07:15.334
That one sticks.

07:15.359 --> 07:17.435
Not everything we have
here is state of the art.

07:19.151 --> 07:20.412
Thanks.

07:20.728 --> 07:22.788
- Theo Hunter.
- Bashir Hamed.

07:22.813 --> 07:24.602
Welcome aboard.

07:28.422 --> 07:30.936
That looks like it has lived a life.

07:34.129 --> 07:35.614
Was, uh...

07:35.639 --> 07:37.831
Was that your family I saw you with?

07:37.856 --> 07:40.034
Yeah. Saying goodbye for the week.

07:40.059 --> 07:43.248
We live in Sudbury, I'm
here doing my fellowship.

07:43.273 --> 07:45.940
- Pediatric EM.
- Uh. We have a patient waiting.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.398
And those stitches should come out.

07:47.423 --> 07:49.316
Mags here used to be a hall monitor.

07:49.341 --> 07:50.995
And Theo here was almost a priest.

07:51.020 --> 07:52.202
- Pastor!
- A pastor.

07:52.227 --> 07:53.651
It runs in the family.

07:59.918 --> 08:01.698
I was on the bus.

08:01.930 --> 08:03.693
They made me get off.

08:03.908 --> 08:06.123
People don't like it when
you throw up on the bus.

08:07.630 --> 08:09.717
Um, my purse and phone.

08:09.742 --> 08:11.280
I had them when I talked to that nurse.

08:11.305 --> 08:13.786
- Did she put them somewhere?
- We'll find them.

08:14.762 --> 08:16.455
How long has this been going on?

08:18.329 --> 08:20.084
Ms. Harper?

08:21.217 --> 08:22.587
Irene?

08:23.267 --> 08:25.606
The vomiting and the abdominal pain.

08:25.631 --> 08:28.221
- When did it start?
- Few days, I think.

08:28.848 --> 08:30.447
Maybe this morning?

08:31.093 --> 08:32.986
I didn't wanna miss my shift today.

08:33.011 --> 08:35.599
I just... thought it was the flu.

08:36.720 --> 08:38.796
But it's worse, right?

08:39.107 --> 08:41.230
Put your hands out for me, Ms. Harper?

08:47.474 --> 08:48.946
Okay, thank you.

08:50.698 --> 08:51.996
My kid.

08:52.884 --> 08:54.801
I'm supposed to pick her
up from school later.

08:54.826 --> 08:56.705
I need my phone so I can...

08:57.090 --> 08:58.673
My husband doesn't know where I am.

08:58.698 --> 09:00.721
It's okay, we'll take care of that.

09:05.527 --> 09:08.633
Atwater wants me to let
you weigh in first, so...

09:08.697 --> 09:10.721
She's confused and disoriented.

09:10.746 --> 09:13.339
Hypotensive and tachycardic.
She's jaundiced.

09:13.364 --> 09:15.424
I'd be concerned with liver injury.

09:15.449 --> 09:18.734
Yeah, but those symptoms could
also describe biliary colic?

09:18.759 --> 09:20.471
But not the trembling hands.

09:20.496 --> 09:23.356
The asterixis can mean
acute liver failure.

09:24.422 --> 09:26.011
We should do testing to confirm.

09:26.036 --> 09:27.488
Given her level of consciousness,

09:27.513 --> 09:29.331
I'd suggest an aggressive approach.

09:29.356 --> 09:31.027
Intubation sooner rather than later.

09:31.052 --> 09:33.527
She could go into
multiple organ failure.

09:34.199 --> 09:35.613
But you want to do testing first.

09:35.638 --> 09:37.870
We need blood. CVC, LFT, all of it.

09:37.895 --> 09:39.441
Okay.

09:39.637 --> 09:41.480
Bashir Hamed?

09:42.582 --> 09:44.784
- Uh, I'll catch up.
- Okay.

09:44.809 --> 09:48.159
Lavondra Kelly, HR. I have
been looking for you.

09:49.335 --> 09:51.534
- Human Resources?
- Uh, yes.

09:51.559 --> 09:52.988
Welcome to the team.

09:53.013 --> 09:54.972
I'm still waiting for your transcripts.

09:54.997 --> 09:56.402
Excuse me?

09:56.427 --> 09:59.394
Your medical school transcripts from...

10:00.522 --> 10:02.300
the University of Aleppo?

10:02.455 --> 10:04.745
I... I sent the PDF.

10:04.770 --> 10:07.331
I know. Didn't somebody
follow up with you on that?

10:08.724 --> 10:12.605
Legal still needs certified original
copies of those transcripts.

10:12.630 --> 10:15.370
Without them we won't be able
to verify your credentials.

10:16.257 --> 10:19.925
If I needed some time
to coordinate that?

10:20.793 --> 10:24.222
Last year the Infectious Disease unit
brought in a Somali candidate.

10:24.373 --> 10:28.105
A doctor who pioneered a leading
approach to malaria in his country.

10:28.130 --> 10:30.675
He couldn't get his
documents in order either,

10:30.700 --> 10:34.527
and now he does data entry
at a university lab.

10:35.111 --> 10:36.711
I see. So...

10:36.866 --> 10:38.534
- The transcripts...
- The originals.

10:38.559 --> 10:39.980
Are essential.

10:40.005 --> 10:42.355
If you want to work as
a doctor, they are.

10:57.040 --> 10:59.941
So, how long have you had this pain?

11:00.896 --> 11:04.197
Two days. But it's getting
worse every hour.

11:04.376 --> 11:07.151
Any other symptoms I should know about?
Fever, vomiting?

11:07.176 --> 11:08.737
Does dry heaving count?

11:10.990 --> 11:14.841
Have you ever experienced these
symptoms before, Ms. Bennet?

11:14.866 --> 11:16.132
Cassie.

11:16.917 --> 11:18.547
I have endometriosis.

11:18.572 --> 11:21.849
But this is way worse than normal.

11:23.523 --> 11:25.993
Have you spoken to your OBGYN
about these new symptoms?

11:26.018 --> 11:27.318
Yes, I have,

11:27.343 --> 11:29.384
and they can't see me until next week.

11:29.409 --> 11:32.057
But last time I saw her, she
just told me to get pregnant.

11:32.082 --> 11:34.627
At least then, I'd have
nine months of relief.

11:34.675 --> 11:37.606
Right. Well, I heard that comes
with its own side of side effects.

11:38.114 --> 11:41.911
Look, the adhesions for endometriosis
can cause severe pain.

11:41.936 --> 11:43.442
Unfortunately, it's a chronic issue

11:43.467 --> 11:45.549
and there's really not too
much we can do for a flare-up

11:45.574 --> 11:47.953
- here in the emergency department.
- I know, I know.

11:47.978 --> 11:49.754
Look, and I know what
you're thinking, okay?

11:49.779 --> 11:52.496
Woman with endo comes in
suffering from a flare-up,

11:52.521 --> 11:54.770
is afraid it's something
worse, and it never is

11:54.795 --> 11:56.481
and there's nothing you can do for her.

11:56.506 --> 11:59.699
Look, I've been through this
more times than I can count.

11:59.724 --> 12:01.676
Alright? I've been told to go home,

12:01.701 --> 12:03.699
and take pain meds, and sleep it off,

12:03.724 --> 12:05.465
and I have done all that.

12:05.490 --> 12:08.184
And I...

12:08.868 --> 12:10.902
Are you here by yourself?

12:14.162 --> 12:15.957
My boyfriend's out of town.

12:16.776 --> 12:19.723
Look, you're just gonna have
to trust me on this. Okay?

12:20.517 --> 12:23.481
I know my body, and
this pain is different.

12:27.668 --> 12:30.467
Irene Harper, INR's 2.1, bili elevated.

12:30.492 --> 12:32.247
Her liver's failing. You
know the procedure?

12:32.272 --> 12:33.984
Screen for hepatitis and acetaminophen.

12:34.009 --> 12:35.671
- LOC?
- Signs of hepatic encephalopathy.

12:35.696 --> 12:37.070
Her O2 sats are borderline.

12:37.095 --> 12:38.875
If she's unconscious,
you need to intubate.

12:38.900 --> 12:41.132
She could go into
multiple organ failure.

12:45.251 --> 12:46.804
We need to pre-oxygenate

12:46.829 --> 12:49.562
then give her a hundred
ketamine and a hundred succs.

13:01.817 --> 13:03.911
- She's apneic.
- Laryngoscope.

13:08.217 --> 13:10.184
Endotracheal tube.

13:14.755 --> 13:16.089
I can't visualize her cords.

13:16.114 --> 13:17.981
- Airway edema?
- No. Cords are anterior.

13:19.054 --> 13:21.044
Let's back off and bag her for a second.

13:21.394 --> 13:23.419
I should call Respiratory Therapy.

13:23.631 --> 13:25.731
Do you have light wands in here?

13:25.756 --> 13:28.357
Um, bottom shelf I think, yeah, why?

13:29.933 --> 13:32.958
With the lighted stylet, you'll be
able to guide it through the tube.

13:36.584 --> 13:38.217
No, I don't have a view.

13:38.433 --> 13:40.059
You will now.

13:41.246 --> 13:43.716
When you said working in the
dark, you meant literally?

13:43.741 --> 13:45.940
Occasionally. Do you need suction?

13:45.965 --> 13:47.130
No.

13:47.155 --> 13:48.622
Could you just...

13:48.647 --> 13:50.198
Okay.

13:55.178 --> 13:58.026
Did you ever think all
that would lead you here?

14:03.214 --> 14:04.955
What led you here?

14:09.336 --> 14:10.847
Everything okay?

14:10.872 --> 14:12.909
Yeah. Tough airway. Just got it.

14:13.941 --> 14:16.242
We don't intubate with
light wands anymore.

14:16.267 --> 14:17.854
I proposed it.

14:18.993 --> 14:20.792
Next time, call RT.

14:20.817 --> 14:23.565
Now let's figure out what's
causing her liver to fail.

14:31.721 --> 14:34.464
The bruising speaks to
rapid deterioration.

14:34.855 --> 14:37.564
She wanted her family. Do you
know if they've been contacted?

14:37.589 --> 14:38.831
No.

14:38.856 --> 14:41.151
Update her chart, then see if
the social worker did that.

14:41.176 --> 14:43.479
I'm gonna run down the rest of her labs.

14:47.666 --> 14:51.026
55-year-old man with
adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.

14:51.051 --> 14:53.235
He had radiation to
reduce the tumour load.

14:53.260 --> 14:55.259
He wants a Whipple? We'll have to see.

14:55.284 --> 14:57.050
What's your story, Dr. Curtis? Quickly.

14:57.075 --> 14:58.169
Emergency walk-in.

14:58.194 --> 15:00.759
I'd like to do a lab to isolate
the cause of her pain.

15:00.784 --> 15:02.807
Endometriosis. We both know we don't do

15:02.832 --> 15:04.374
elective procedures
for chronic problems.

15:04.399 --> 15:06.118
- Yes, but...
- She's likely having a flare-up.

15:06.143 --> 15:08.141
I did a transvaginal ultrasound and...

15:08.166 --> 15:09.733
Nothing's conclusive on it.

15:09.758 --> 15:11.556
There have been cases
where imaging has missed

15:11.581 --> 15:13.678
ovarian torsion, even a ruptured cyst.

15:13.703 --> 15:15.548
Her abdomen's distended,
she's in extreme pain,

15:15.573 --> 15:18.491
and I'm concerned it could be
more than endometriosis...

15:18.516 --> 15:19.743
Are you?

15:20.359 --> 15:22.626
Or are you fishing for OR time.

15:22.651 --> 15:24.548
You know I want the operative time.

15:24.580 --> 15:26.533
But that doesn't mean
my patient is wrong

15:26.558 --> 15:27.961
about her pain being acute.

15:27.986 --> 15:29.227
Dr. Curtis...

15:29.520 --> 15:31.095
Endo's tricky.

15:31.240 --> 15:34.033
Women can feel one thing one day,

15:34.058 --> 15:35.798
and something completely
different the next.

15:35.823 --> 15:38.649
The pathophysiology of uterine nerves...

15:38.674 --> 15:39.705
They're complex.

15:39.730 --> 15:43.447
And often don't correspond to
what's happening internally.

15:43.510 --> 15:45.042
And every time we go in there,

15:45.067 --> 15:47.737
we run the risk of doing
more harm than good.

15:47.762 --> 15:49.479
Surgical intervention is not an option

15:49.504 --> 15:52.772
in the absence of
extremely clear evidence,

15:52.897 --> 15:55.057
which you simply do not have here.

15:55.442 --> 15:57.463
She should follow up with her OBGYN.

15:57.488 --> 15:58.534
Send them the ultrasound.

15:58.559 --> 16:01.437
Otherwise, give her Toradol
and send her home to rest.

16:01.462 --> 16:04.119
64-year-old female, arteriogram.

16:04.144 --> 16:06.213
Aneurism at four centimeters.

16:06.238 --> 16:07.814
Let's keep her under observation.

16:07.839 --> 16:10.572
- It's okay, we're just gonna ask...
- You can't do this again!

16:10.597 --> 16:12.461
Mr. Harper, calm down. Layla...

16:12.486 --> 16:14.020
- Don't you touch her!
- Daddy!

16:14.045 --> 16:16.221
Layla, the nurse just wants
to ask you some questions.

16:16.246 --> 16:17.874
I told you before to leave her alone!

16:17.899 --> 16:19.970
- You have no right to do this!
- Actually, I do!

16:19.995 --> 16:21.619
And for your daughter's sake,
why don't we calm down?

16:21.644 --> 16:23.127
You tell me that my wife is sick,

16:23.152 --> 16:24.636
and you take one look
at me and decide what?

16:24.661 --> 16:26.847
- That I am a threat to my family?
- That's not what's happening, here!

16:26.872 --> 16:28.144
You don't know me!

16:28.169 --> 16:29.925
Is this Irene Harper's family?

16:29.950 --> 16:31.495
I'm Dr. Hamed. She's my patient.

16:31.520 --> 16:32.761
You're Irene's doctor?

16:32.786 --> 16:34.969
Please tell me you can explain
what is wrong with her.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.448
He will. But first, I need
to talk to your daughter

16:37.473 --> 16:40.729
- and make sure that she's okay.
- Daddy, I wanna stay with you!

16:40.754 --> 16:42.921
Baby, it's okay.

16:42.946 --> 16:44.752
Is everything okay here, sir?

16:44.883 --> 16:47.713
Yeah, we're okay, alright?

16:48.161 --> 16:52.627
- We're okay.
- Lou, gimme a sec? Doctor.

16:55.601 --> 16:57.563
Vivian Barnes, staff social worker.

16:57.588 --> 16:59.448
Can you talk to me about
the bruising on Irene?

16:59.473 --> 17:01.557
I need to know what we're
dealing with, here.

17:01.582 --> 17:04.698
You wrote suspicious
bruising on her chart. Why?

17:04.757 --> 17:07.214
You think that the bruising
was caused by her husband?

17:07.240 --> 17:08.223
You don't?

17:08.249 --> 17:10.021
Well, if she's suffering
from liver failure,

17:10.046 --> 17:12.307
possible kidney failure,
either could cause bruising.

17:12.332 --> 17:14.021
This family has a flag.

17:14.046 --> 17:15.762
A history with Children's Aid Society.

17:15.788 --> 17:17.695
There was an incident two years ago.

17:17.721 --> 17:19.520
Layla fell down the stairs,

17:19.545 --> 17:22.115
and CAS intervened for her protection.

17:24.181 --> 17:26.948
I meant medically undetermined.
Not intentional...

17:26.973 --> 17:29.340
You wrote suspicious, so
I have to investigate.

17:29.365 --> 17:30.797
It's protocol.

17:30.822 --> 17:33.365
And the father's behaviour
isn't helping the situation.

17:33.390 --> 17:35.732
- People act out when they get scared.
- I know.

17:35.757 --> 17:37.178
But Layla's safety is my priority.

17:37.188 --> 17:38.849
I'll interview her, and
we'll go from there.

17:38.874 --> 17:40.237
What will happen to her?

17:40.262 --> 17:42.849
If we have reason to
believe that he's abusive,

17:42.874 --> 17:45.341
- we can remove her.
- Wait, no, I can change the wording!

17:45.366 --> 17:47.083
It's too late for that now.

17:51.093 --> 17:53.537
Layla, it's time to go, okay?

17:53.562 --> 17:55.841
It's okay, baby girl, I'll see you soon.

17:55.866 --> 17:57.566
I promise.

18:08.615 --> 18:10.677
Ms. Bennett.

18:11.520 --> 18:13.152
You're sending me home.

18:13.430 --> 18:16.177
Uh, well your imaging didn't, uh...

18:16.202 --> 18:17.931
didn't warrant further action.

18:18.055 --> 18:20.495
But we will forward it to
your OBGYN for a follow up.

18:20.520 --> 18:22.191
In the meantime, I did...

18:22.216 --> 18:24.550
I did give you some
anti-inflammatories for the pain.

18:24.583 --> 18:27.718
- So, if it gets any worse...
- What, come back?

18:27.776 --> 18:29.583
It's already worse.

18:29.775 --> 18:32.821
Please, please don't be
like the rest of them.

18:33.191 --> 18:34.824
Don't do this.

18:37.551 --> 18:40.161
You can take your time getting dressed.

18:48.585 --> 18:50.285
How's my wife? How's Irene?

18:50.310 --> 18:52.373
Well, she doesn't have hepatitis,

18:52.398 --> 18:54.607
which means the differential
is wider than we thought.

18:54.632 --> 18:55.912
We're keeping her stable,

18:55.937 --> 18:58.106
but we need to know if she's
been exposed to any toxins

18:58.131 --> 19:00.379
- which could be affecting her liver.
- Does she drink?

19:00.404 --> 19:02.959
- No more than anyone.
- Any drug use?

19:02.984 --> 19:05.352
You think she's on drugs? No!

19:05.377 --> 19:06.827
What about something she ate?

19:07.053 --> 19:09.249
She ate what we always eat.

19:09.274 --> 19:12.342
Chicken... Salad, I don't know. Okay?

19:12.367 --> 19:15.045
Irene takes care of herself.
Of all of us.

19:15.070 --> 19:17.733
Okay? No fast food, no junk.

19:17.758 --> 19:19.858
What about her workplace.
Is she employed?

19:19.883 --> 19:23.219
Yes, she's employed. Okay?
She cuts hair.

19:23.455 --> 19:25.021
Hair dyes, chemicals?

19:25.046 --> 19:27.365
- If we can narrow down the tox screen...
- Can you help her?

19:27.390 --> 19:29.923
First we need to determine
why your wife is sick.

19:30.565 --> 19:34.162
And I can't get my kid back until
I prove that I didn't hurt Irene.

19:34.187 --> 19:36.522
Because I didn't, and I never would.

19:36.547 --> 19:37.912
Or Layla.

19:37.937 --> 19:40.129
That fall two years ago was an accident.

19:40.154 --> 19:42.722
Sir, the social worker is
just following protocol here.

19:42.830 --> 19:44.498
The last time this happened,

19:44.523 --> 19:46.656
she thought she was going to lose us.

19:46.687 --> 19:47.851
Then they kept coming back,

19:47.876 --> 19:49.623
until they finally decide
to leave us alone.

19:49.648 --> 19:53.670
But Layla wouldn't sleep
in her own bed for months.

19:53.695 --> 19:55.628
And now it's happening again.

19:55.653 --> 19:58.287
It wasn't my intention to suggest abuse.

19:58.654 --> 20:00.139
I heard you.

20:00.164 --> 20:02.764
Suspicious bruising,
that's what you said.

20:02.789 --> 20:05.905
So I'm losing my family because you
don't know how to speak English?

20:16.560 --> 20:17.975
_

20:18.000 --> 20:19.787
_

20:19.812 --> 20:21.662
_

20:21.710 --> 20:23.842
_

20:23.912 --> 20:25.772
_

20:25.921 --> 20:27.662
_

20:27.795 --> 20:29.717
_

20:29.742 --> 20:30.960
_

20:30.985 --> 20:33.491
_

20:33.950 --> 20:37.264
_

20:38.131 --> 20:41.123
_

20:41.429 --> 20:42.881
_

20:43.576 --> 20:45.701
Couldn't be worse than my last ones.

20:46.256 --> 20:48.660
Saleh, Salaam alaikum.

20:48.685 --> 20:51.030
W'alaikum Al-salaam, Bashir.

21:14.733 --> 21:17.397
<i>The many airstrikes targeted</i>

21:17.422 --> 21:19.914
<i>homes hospitals and market</i>

21:19.939 --> 21:22.793
<i>shattering the daily lives
of the local population.</i>

21:22.818 --> 21:25.680
<i>Hundreds of thousands
of people fled north</i>

21:25.705 --> 21:28.159
<i>to the overflowing Turkish border.</i>

21:28.184 --> 21:30.285
<i>What started as a peaceful protest</i>

21:30.310 --> 21:33.260
<i>against the Assad regime
in the spring of 2011</i>

21:33.285 --> 21:34.983
<i>has turned into one of the bloodiest...</i>

21:35.008 --> 21:36.317
Bash.

21:37.199 --> 21:39.432
- Have you eaten?
- No.

21:39.597 --> 21:41.124
If there's any advice I can give you

21:41.149 --> 21:42.833
about making it through your day here

21:42.948 --> 21:44.881
is always remember to eat.

21:45.899 --> 21:47.433
Come on!

21:50.377 --> 21:53.177
Yeah, I gotta ask. That drill.

21:53.202 --> 21:55.140
Was that standard operating
procedure for you?

21:55.165 --> 21:56.926
You should see what I
can do with a hammer.

21:56.951 --> 21:58.996
So were you already in medicine

21:59.021 --> 22:01.416
- before the war broke out?
- I was doing my residency.

22:01.441 --> 22:02.730
My first residency.

22:02.755 --> 22:05.379
- Mmm. Come here with family?
- My sister. She's 12.

22:05.404 --> 22:06.771
How's she handling everything?

22:06.796 --> 22:08.362
She's adjusting.

22:08.387 --> 22:11.113
You said your family lives
in a different city?

22:11.138 --> 22:13.203
Sudbury. Much smaller town.

22:13.228 --> 22:15.098
We didn't want to displace the girls.

22:15.123 --> 22:16.661
My father-in-law has a family practice

22:16.686 --> 22:18.652
waiting for me when I'm done. So...

22:18.677 --> 22:20.066
You must miss them.

22:20.398 --> 22:21.597
Terribly.

22:21.622 --> 22:24.199
I try not to let myself
think that my absence

22:24.224 --> 22:26.465
will be permanently scarring.

22:28.591 --> 22:29.991
I, uh...

22:30.016 --> 22:33.574
I have a patient who has a
child here today, and, uh...

22:33.599 --> 22:36.480
- This social worker intervened...
- Layla Harper?

22:36.505 --> 22:38.371
Yeah, Viv asked me to examine her.

22:38.439 --> 22:39.771
No signs of physical abuse.

22:39.796 --> 22:42.096
But her family's still
being separated? Why?

22:42.121 --> 22:44.021
It's hard to overcome a
history like theirs.

22:44.046 --> 22:45.378
Even if it's not true?

22:45.403 --> 22:47.371
The father said he was
cleared of all wrong-doing.

22:47.396 --> 22:49.504
Yeah. Doesn't seem fair, but...

22:49.529 --> 22:51.795
he'll always be seen
with suspicion first.

22:51.820 --> 22:53.902
Oh!

22:53.927 --> 22:57.660
So much for my own advice! Gotta go!

23:09.392 --> 23:11.809
My wife. Have you seen her?

23:12.054 --> 23:14.051
I've been here six hours!

23:14.164 --> 23:16.629
Unfortunately, your wife's
condition hasn't changed but...

23:16.654 --> 23:19.751
What I said to you before.
I'm not racist.

23:19.776 --> 23:22.787
That's not who I am. I'm just...
just scared.

23:22.812 --> 23:23.812
I know.

23:25.067 --> 23:27.418
Mr. Harper, are you feeling okay?
Do you need to sit down?

23:27.443 --> 23:29.488
No, no, I'm fine, I'm fine. Listen.

23:29.513 --> 23:30.926
When can I see my daughter?

23:30.951 --> 23:32.753
Sir? Can you hear me?

23:33.795 --> 23:35.434
Arnold!

23:44.441 --> 23:45.772
What happened?

23:45.797 --> 23:48.031
I got two blocks away and threw up.

23:48.551 --> 23:50.832
You told me to come
back if it got worse.

23:51.035 --> 23:52.207
They just...

23:52.232 --> 23:55.074
They just gave me the bucket
and told me to wait here.

23:56.560 --> 24:00.441
I was trying to make it to the
bathroom, but I-I couldn't.

24:00.466 --> 24:02.762
Come on.

24:09.643 --> 24:12.192
I need someone to fight for me.

24:14.768 --> 24:17.101
Just, uh...

24:20.724 --> 24:22.491
Okay.

24:23.712 --> 24:25.434
- You okay?
- Yeah.

24:25.459 --> 24:27.668
Alright. Let's go.

24:33.799 --> 24:35.587
Doctor Singh?

24:35.952 --> 24:37.085
Doctor Singh.

24:37.110 --> 24:39.287
The endometriosis patient
I brought you earlier...

24:39.312 --> 24:40.549
I thought we sent her home.

24:40.574 --> 24:41.994
We did, and she's back. In agony.

24:42.019 --> 24:43.369
She's vomiting, she's hemorrhaging

24:43.394 --> 24:45.190
which we both know are
signs of a ruptured cyst

24:45.215 --> 24:46.509
and not just chronic endo pain.

24:46.534 --> 24:48.384
She needs surgery now.

24:50.967 --> 24:52.532
Book an OR. Stat.

24:52.557 --> 24:55.290
And I wanna stay on and
see this patient through.

24:56.066 --> 24:57.332
It's your call.

24:57.357 --> 25:00.705
If it is ruptured, it's good
we caught it when we did.

25:04.744 --> 25:06.299
He was starting to look jaundiced,

25:06.324 --> 25:07.956
and losing consciousness, like his wife.

25:07.981 --> 25:09.383
And his airway is compromised.

25:09.408 --> 25:10.795
We should resuscitate and intubate.

25:10.820 --> 25:14.267
- 100 ketamine, 100 succs.
- Heart rate's 110, BP's crashing.

25:14.292 --> 25:17.557
I need two large bore IVs. Let's
get this patient 2 liters of NS

25:17.582 --> 25:19.947
stats, CPC, chem, coags, LFTs,

25:19.972 --> 25:21.890
and cross-match four units red cells.

25:24.776 --> 25:27.736
IVC's flat. He's hypovolemic
but no signs of free fluid.

25:31.113 --> 25:33.048
Hematemesis.

25:33.167 --> 25:34.884
If he has genetic varices,

25:34.909 --> 25:38.017
elevated INR will cause this
kind of sudden bleeding.

25:38.367 --> 25:40.462
Which would mean his
liver's also failing?

25:40.487 --> 25:43.900
And whatever caused Irene's
problem is affecting them both.

25:44.001 --> 25:45.822
Get Dr. Hunter to check on the daughter.

25:45.847 --> 25:47.432
- On it.
- Where is Atwater.

25:47.457 --> 25:48.925
She's with a patient on six.

25:48.950 --> 25:51.861
- I need a Blakemore kit.
- What?

25:51.886 --> 25:54.392
This man will bleed to death if
we don't get a Blakemore now!

25:54.417 --> 25:55.487
Okay. Got it.

25:55.512 --> 25:57.565
We can't put in a Blakemore
without an attending.

25:57.590 --> 26:00.500
- Atwater's on her way.
- His heart rate is through the roof!

26:00.525 --> 26:02.837
Blakemores are incredibly risky,
we don't use them except...

26:02.862 --> 26:03.876
As a last resort?

26:03.901 --> 26:06.250
And if we don't do something
now this man is going to die.

26:06.275 --> 26:08.198
- Have you ever seen one work?
- Yes.

26:08.223 --> 26:11.285
And if this one's going to, we don't
have another second to waste.

26:12.434 --> 26:14.315
Four units, O-negative!

26:15.141 --> 26:16.608
No pulse. He's in cardiac arrest.

26:16.633 --> 26:18.500
I need a board. On three.

26:18.525 --> 26:20.494
One, two, three.

26:20.519 --> 26:22.456
One, two, three.

26:23.879 --> 26:26.680
1 amp epi, keep giving packed cells.

26:26.705 --> 26:28.339
When I inflate it in his stomach,

26:28.364 --> 26:30.839
it should stop the bleeding.

26:34.193 --> 26:36.917
Okay, he's been down for 25 seconds!

26:38.105 --> 26:39.770
What the hell's happening here?

26:39.795 --> 26:41.800
Massive hematemesis and
hemorrhagic shock.

26:41.825 --> 26:43.206
He just lost his pulse.

26:43.231 --> 26:45.988
- You sanctioned this?
- He wasn't protecting his airway

26:46.013 --> 26:47.894
- so I put in the Blakemore.
- Okay.

26:47.919 --> 26:49.336
Packed cells through the Level one.

26:49.361 --> 26:51.643
Pass me the OG tube, and
get out of the way.

26:52.322 --> 26:54.542
He needs the proximal
balloon up as well.

26:54.951 --> 26:56.784
Dr. Leblanc, you stay.

26:57.315 --> 27:00.495
- One gram TXA.
- 50 mics of octreotide.

27:00.520 --> 27:01.952
Go!

27:12.894 --> 27:14.727
Is Robbie alive?

27:15.005 --> 27:17.417
He's hanging on by a thread in ICU.

27:17.442 --> 27:19.333
Dr. Hunter checked the daughter,

27:19.358 --> 27:21.512
took blood, her vitals look good.

27:21.879 --> 27:23.481
I couldn't let her
lose both her parents.

27:23.512 --> 27:25.987
Yeah. You didn't build consensus.
You just did whatever you wanted

27:26.012 --> 27:27.737
and those decisions have consequences.

27:27.762 --> 27:28.817
If I'd asked you permission,

27:28.842 --> 27:30.142
you would have said
it's against the rules.

27:30.167 --> 27:33.356
If you want me to trust you, I
need to know who you are first.

27:33.957 --> 27:36.965
If you're here long enough
for that to happen.

27:58.698 --> 28:00.164
Layla?

28:00.545 --> 28:02.128
Where is Vivian?

28:04.808 --> 28:06.597
You wanted to see your mom.

28:07.964 --> 28:09.549
Is that hers?

28:09.758 --> 28:13.589
- I can put it somewhere safe.
- I don't want it to get lost.

28:16.791 --> 28:18.323
Good idea.

28:20.935 --> 28:23.276
Do you want to put a bandage on me?

28:23.541 --> 28:25.722
I know I could use one, too.

28:42.734 --> 28:45.699
You should still be at home, resting.

28:45.777 --> 28:48.527
Relax. I've been cleared for work.

28:48.552 --> 28:49.980
Mm.

28:52.152 --> 28:53.376
There's only a bit nausea.

28:53.401 --> 28:55.244
Four milligrams will be plenty.

28:55.269 --> 28:57.964
- I'm not a chemo patient, Claire.
- Mm.

28:57.989 --> 29:00.371
Something tells me you haven't
even told your neurosurgeon

29:00.396 --> 29:02.029
about your nausea.

29:02.416 --> 29:04.464
Are you still getting those headaches?

29:04.528 --> 29:06.562
Normal symptoms after my surgery.

29:06.587 --> 29:07.783
Yeah?

29:07.808 --> 29:10.141
What about questionable decision-making?

29:11.308 --> 29:14.376
Come on, are you sure hiring this
guy was the right move, Jed?

29:14.401 --> 29:15.600
Ugh.

29:19.190 --> 29:20.652
Hey.

29:21.040 --> 29:22.807
How's your son handling all this?

29:23.086 --> 29:24.495
He's fine.

29:25.825 --> 29:28.158
Have you even told him
about the accident?

29:28.453 --> 29:31.433
Mm, well, managing your
concern is enough.

29:31.482 --> 29:33.503
You're welcome.

30:01.852 --> 30:03.752
We need to keep Layla
overnight and monitor.

30:03.777 --> 30:05.954
Otherwise they'll send
her alone to strangers.

30:05.979 --> 30:06.979
Well she can't go home

30:07.004 --> 30:08.914
because there's obviously
some kind of exposure.

30:08.939 --> 30:12.775
But she's not symptomatic, so it
can't be airborne or water, but...

30:15.144 --> 30:16.954
Could it be food?

30:17.136 --> 30:19.136
The father says they eat healthy.

30:20.030 --> 30:21.829
Produce has pesticides?

30:22.143 --> 30:24.634
Maybe. Although Layla is not sick.

30:25.610 --> 30:27.010
What are you thinking?

30:27.035 --> 30:29.478
She picked off all the
vegetables on her pizza.

30:29.511 --> 30:31.189
So what did they eat that she didn't?

30:31.214 --> 30:32.799
- Let's find out.
- No, no, no you can't.

30:32.824 --> 30:34.589
After what you did, they
want you in the suture room

30:34.614 --> 30:36.048
for the rest of your shift.

30:36.073 --> 30:37.172
Dr. Leblanc.

30:37.386 --> 30:38.860
Layla's all alone.

30:38.885 --> 30:40.683
She's afraid of losing everything,

30:40.708 --> 30:43.174
so if you push too
hard she'll shut down.

30:43.789 --> 30:45.619
Everybody calls me Mags.

30:53.495 --> 30:55.279
Hey, Layla.

30:55.304 --> 30:57.087
I'm Dr. Leblanc.

30:59.839 --> 31:02.236
Layla's feeling pretty quiet right now.

31:03.813 --> 31:07.478
I need help narrowing down what
her parents might've eaten.

31:08.825 --> 31:10.017
Layla?

31:10.244 --> 31:12.564
Could you answer a few more questions

31:12.589 --> 31:15.150
about your mom and dad for Dr. Leblanc?

31:17.576 --> 31:19.175
Can I colour with you?

31:19.200 --> 31:21.337
I'll go get her some water.

31:24.053 --> 31:25.900
That's a nice tree.

31:31.331 --> 31:34.065
This hospital's really
big and scary, huh?

31:34.477 --> 31:36.079
Hm?

31:37.256 --> 31:39.022
I want to go home.

31:39.047 --> 31:40.546
I know.

31:42.158 --> 31:46.158
When I was your age, I had to spend
the night in the hospital too.

31:47.510 --> 31:49.727
Lots of times, actually.

31:52.118 --> 31:53.767
But you know what?

31:54.061 --> 31:57.392
I found out hospitals are full
of people that want to help.

31:57.708 --> 31:59.541
So when I grew up, I...

31:59.985 --> 32:02.517
I became one of the helpers.

32:04.728 --> 32:07.798
And Layla there are maybe something
that your parents like to eat

32:07.823 --> 32:10.923
that you don't, and that's
what's making them sick.

32:11.612 --> 32:14.146
And if we can just find
that one little thing,

32:14.391 --> 32:16.579
maybe I could help them feel better.

32:17.226 --> 32:19.345
Do you think you can help me do that?

32:27.372 --> 32:30.663
Layla picked out vegetables with
her father at a community garden.

32:30.688 --> 32:32.692
Layla doesn't like mushrooms.

32:32.717 --> 32:34.671
Her parents do.

32:51.364 --> 32:52.896
It was a, uh...

32:53.703 --> 32:55.502
It was a difficult surgery.

32:56.369 --> 32:59.018
In addition to the extensive
scarring from endometriosis,

32:59.043 --> 33:00.810
you also had a...

33:01.029 --> 33:03.511
hemorrhaging, ruptured cyst.

33:03.959 --> 33:05.315
And...

33:05.340 --> 33:07.926
as a result of the damage,

33:07.951 --> 33:10.917
we had to remove one of your ovaries.

33:12.497 --> 33:13.996
I lost an ovary?

33:14.119 --> 33:17.589
Well, the good news is we got in
in time to save the other one.

33:20.706 --> 33:22.239
You...

33:23.551 --> 33:25.088
You told us

33:25.268 --> 33:27.292
that it was more serious all along,

33:27.472 --> 33:30.503
and the system's just not good
at dealing with chronic pain,

33:30.528 --> 33:32.713
- so...
- You don't know what it's like

33:32.738 --> 33:35.120
to be dismissed and ignored.

33:35.624 --> 33:38.025
Told what you feel isn't real.

33:43.597 --> 33:47.589
Cassie, I just wanted you to hear
someone say that you were right.

33:49.255 --> 33:51.214
I know I was.

34:16.882 --> 34:19.053
Didn't your shift end 20 minutes ago?

34:19.737 --> 34:21.803
Yes. But I, um...

34:22.193 --> 34:23.552
I was just...

34:23.577 --> 34:26.474
Waiting for Bishop to tell
you if you still work here?

34:27.170 --> 34:28.560
He's gone.

34:28.585 --> 34:32.896
Which means you get to spend
all night dreaming up plan B.

34:33.053 --> 34:34.428
Hmm.

34:35.895 --> 34:37.559
This is my plan B.

34:39.732 --> 34:41.411
You should go home.

34:51.929 --> 34:54.295
How is it feeling? The arm?

34:54.385 --> 34:57.083
- Much better, thanks to you.
- Can you raise it?

35:01.321 --> 35:02.615
Open.

35:02.859 --> 35:04.084
Okay.

35:04.109 --> 35:05.990
The sling can come off.

35:06.015 --> 35:07.959
Favour your other side
if you need to work.

35:07.984 --> 35:09.521
_

35:09.616 --> 35:11.420
_

35:11.445 --> 35:13.474
_

35:13.506 --> 35:15.131
_

35:15.155 --> 35:16.998
_

35:17.154 --> 35:18.740
_

35:19.045 --> 35:22.232
_

35:22.412 --> 35:23.490
_

35:23.515 --> 35:25.013
I wish I could.

35:26.816 --> 35:29.107
Not the kind of place willing
to pay under the table.

35:29.132 --> 35:31.730
Even for me, it's going to be difficult

35:31.755 --> 35:33.592
getting them the papers they asked for.

35:33.893 --> 35:36.766
- Which papers?
- My university transcripts.

35:36.791 --> 35:38.740
I have copies, they need the originals.

35:39.982 --> 35:43.037
I got your sister a phone.
Maybe I can get you these too.

35:43.062 --> 35:44.895
Yeah, you mean forgeries, Khaled.

35:44.920 --> 35:46.474
It would only prove who you already are.

35:46.499 --> 35:48.717
No, there must be another way.

35:50.326 --> 35:53.381
In case there isn't, I know
a man who makes documents.

35:53.477 --> 35:55.420
You say the word, I will ask him.

36:01.407 --> 36:02.988
Amira!

36:03.720 --> 36:05.503
Are you here?

36:21.345 --> 36:24.579
_

36:25.399 --> 36:27.805
_

36:30.285 --> 36:33.688
How was your first day?

36:34.164 --> 36:35.931
It was fine.

37:25.892 --> 37:28.452
Baba used to let me
listen to his heartbeat.

37:28.477 --> 37:31.345
It always helped me fall asleep.

37:42.453 --> 37:45.517
How was your first day, really?

37:51.320 --> 37:52.837
I loved it.

38:50.003 --> 38:52.704
Ah, you're supposed to find
Bishop before changing.

38:52.853 --> 38:55.667
Don't apologize, he hates that.

39:02.011 --> 39:04.908
You wanted to see me, sir?

39:06.179 --> 39:07.986
The Blakemore.

39:08.234 --> 39:10.640
It better not have been the first
time you pulled that move.

39:14.328 --> 39:17.062
Dr. Leblanc thinks you
saved that man's life.

39:17.439 --> 39:19.190
You could just as
easily have killed him.

39:19.215 --> 39:21.609
Most emergent Blakemores
end in the morgue.

39:26.675 --> 39:29.369
I did say to find your place, here.

39:33.203 --> 39:34.703
Dr. Bishop?

39:36.451 --> 39:39.072
I've been asked to provide
the original copies

39:39.097 --> 39:40.764
of my medical school transcripts.

39:40.789 --> 39:42.523
But I need you to know

39:42.548 --> 39:45.103
my university might never release them.

39:45.768 --> 39:47.182
But sir, I did earn my degree.

39:47.207 --> 39:49.627
I am the doctor I told you I was.

39:53.670 --> 39:55.564
Close the door on your way out.

40:04.931 --> 40:06.528
We were able to confirm

40:06.553 --> 40:08.584
that the toxin you and
your wife ingested

40:08.609 --> 40:10.224
came from wild mushrooms.

40:10.249 --> 40:11.920
I picked those mushrooms.

40:11.945 --> 40:13.362
This was all my fault.

40:13.387 --> 40:15.131
Well, you're both responding
to treatment well.

40:15.156 --> 40:17.423
- It will take some time, but...
- Maybe...

40:18.531 --> 40:20.302
they were right to judge me.

40:20.327 --> 40:21.452
No they weren't.

40:21.477 --> 40:23.101
People can think what
they want to think,

40:23.126 --> 40:24.679
but you know who you are.

40:24.761 --> 40:26.248
A man who loves his family.

40:27.738 --> 40:29.287
Daddy!

40:29.792 --> 40:33.381
Hey. There's my brave girl.

40:34.942 --> 40:37.459
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

40:39.737 --> 40:41.403
We're okay, now.

40:41.939 --> 40:43.803
Mom's gonna be okay.

40:43.828 --> 40:45.883
Can you believe it was the mushrooms?

40:45.908 --> 40:48.037
You stayed with her all night?

40:48.062 --> 40:50.263
Mushrooms, I know.

40:52.788 --> 40:55.420
- I'm glad you're okay.
- Your stitches should come out.

40:55.445 --> 40:59.560
I love you guys. I
love you guys so much.

41:07.924 --> 41:10.409
Both my parents were doctors.

41:14.183 --> 41:16.425
It was all I was ever going to be.

41:20.744 --> 41:22.605
I lost them in the war.

41:24.306 --> 41:26.597
And that's why I don't talk about it.

41:29.815 --> 41:31.863
The scars will fade.

42:08.356 --> 42:10.110
Dr. Hamed?

42:10.791 --> 42:12.158
Detective Greggs.

42:12.263 --> 42:13.635
I'm sorry to bother you at work.

42:13.660 --> 42:15.930
- I know you have a lot on your plate.
- Mm-hmm.

42:15.955 --> 42:18.822
You were involved in a major vehicle
incident a couple of weeks ago?

42:18.847 --> 42:19.867
Mm-hmm.

42:19.892 --> 42:21.954
I'd like to ask you a few
questions about that.

42:21.979 --> 42:24.188
Uh, but I already spoke to the police.

42:24.213 --> 42:26.480
Uh, I'm here about
your former colleague.

42:26.785 --> 42:28.687
Khaled Abdullah.

42:29.400 --> 42:31.400
Emergency personnel took his name,

42:31.425 --> 42:32.752
but then lost track of him

42:32.777 --> 42:34.650
when he fled the scene of the accident.

42:35.112 --> 42:36.751
Do you know where he is?

42:37.814 --> 42:41.748
Mr. Abdullah is wanted for
an immigration violation.

42:42.248 --> 42:44.248
I need to locate him, so...

42:44.646 --> 42:47.891
if you see him, call me.

42:55.218 --> 43:00.217
