WEBVTT

00:06.837 --> 00:08.839
( Christmas music playing )

00:14.805 --> 00:15.805
OH!

00:15.806 --> 00:17.137
HONEY, CHECK THIS OUT.

00:17.138 --> 00:18.138
MADE IT IN THE SIXTH GRADE.

00:18.139 --> 00:19.139
PASTA CLAUS.

00:19.140 --> 00:20.940
AW, SO TALENTED.

00:20.941 --> 00:22.813
AND NOW, FOR THE
FINISHING TOUCH.

00:24.985 --> 00:26.816
WH... WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:26.817 --> 00:28.198
PUTTING MY SILVER STAR
ON TOP OF THE TREE.

00:28.199 --> 00:29.319
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:29.320 --> 00:31.241
I'M PUTTING MY ANGEL
ON TOP OF THE TREE.

00:31.242 --> 00:33.613
HONEY, MY GREAT-GRANDMOTHER
MADE THIS ANGEL AS A CHILD

00:33.614 --> 00:35.746
IN ITALY OUT OF CORN HUSKS
AND SUN-DRIED TOMATOES.

00:36.997 --> 00:38.748
I THINK IT DESERVES THE
TOP SPOT ON THE TREE.

00:38.749 --> 00:40.620
UH, TRUST ME. MY SILVER STAR

00:40.621 --> 00:42.662
HAS MUCH MORE
SIGNIFICANCE THAN THAT.

00:42.663 --> 00:44.254
OKAY, IT WAS MY
GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER'S,

00:44.255 --> 00:46.005
AND IT'S THE ONLY THING
THAT THE BURKES PASS DOWN

00:46.006 --> 00:47.297
FROM ONE GENERATION TO THE NEXT.

00:47.298 --> 00:50.930
YEAH, WELL, THAT AND A HIGH
TOLERANCE FOR ALCOHOL.

00:50.931 --> 00:53.303
THERE'S A BEAUTIFUL
STORY BEHIND THIS STAR

00:53.304 --> 00:55.054
AND I THINK, ONCE YOU HEAR IT,

00:55.055 --> 00:57.847
YOU'LL AGREE THAT IT'S THE GREATEST
CHRISTMAS STORY OF ALL TIME.

00:57.848 --> 00:59.809
THE GREATEST CHRISTMAS
STORY OF ALL TIME?

00:59.810 --> 01:02.312
HAVE YOU HEARD THE ONE ABOUT THE
LITTLE BABY AND THE MANGER?

01:02.313 --> 01:04.854
OKAY, SECOND GREATEST.

01:04.855 --> 01:08.238
IT ALL BEGAN WITH MY GREAT-
GREAT-GRANDMOTHER, MELANIE,

01:08.239 --> 01:10.320
OVER A HUNDRED YEARS AGO.

01:10.321 --> 01:11.861
MORNING, DEAR LISBETH.

01:11.862 --> 01:14.073
MY, YOU LOOK LOVELY.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.575
IF ONLY I COULD CAPTURE
AN IMAGE OF YOU

01:15.576 --> 01:19.199
AND SEND IT IMMEDIATELY TO MY
CLOSEST FRIENDS TO ADMIRE.

01:19.200 --> 01:22.332
OH, MISS MELANIE,
YOU'RE SUCH A DREAMER.

01:22.333 --> 01:24.414
LOOK AT THIS DECORATING
TECHNIQUE I DISCOVERED.

01:24.415 --> 01:26.626
YOU SIMPLY PIN THE PAPER
SNOWFLAKES OVER THE HOLES

01:26.627 --> 01:28.878
IN THE CURTAINS AND
SUDDENLY YOUR HOME LOOKS...

01:28.879 --> 01:31.801
FESTIVE AND NOT SO POOR.

01:31.802 --> 01:35.305
HOW IT SADDENS ME THAT THIS IS
WHAT HAS BECOME OF BURKEWOOD.

01:35.306 --> 01:37.427
I THOUGHT MY FATHER'S INVENTION
OF THE HORSELESS CARRIAGE

01:37.428 --> 01:40.059
WOULD SET US UP FOR LIFE,
BUT IT WENT NOWHERE.

01:40.060 --> 01:42.062
PERHAPS SOME SORT OF A
MOTOR WOULD HAVE HELPED.

01:44.024 --> 01:46.816
WELL, STILL, YOU'VE GIVEN ME
SUCH A WONDERFUL LIFE HERE.

01:46.817 --> 01:50.280
TELL ME, WHY DID YOU TAKE ME IN
WHEN I WAS JUST AN ORPHAN WRESTLING

01:50.281 --> 01:52.442
A FELLOW STREET URCHIN
FOR A MEAT PIE?

01:52.443 --> 01:54.904
HELPING THE LESS FORTUNATE
IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO,

01:54.905 --> 01:57.658
AND OF ALL THE URCHINS IN THE
GUTTER, YOU WERE THE CUTEST ONE.

01:59.200 --> 02:00.410
SERIOUSLY?

02:00.411 --> 02:03.793
MELANIE AND LISBETH
AT BURKEWOOD?

02:03.794 --> 02:07.046
HEY, DON'T INTERRUPT, OR I'LL FIND
SOMEWHERE ELSE TO SHOVE THIS SILVER STAR.

02:07.047 --> 02:09.170
WOULD THAT FREE UP THE TOP
OF THE TREE FOR MY ANGEL?

02:12.343 --> 02:17.518
♪ I GUESS YOU'RE STUCK WITH ME ♪

02:21.312 --> 02:22.932
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS
IS OUR GOOD CHINA.

02:22.933 --> 02:25.936
IT LOOKS THE INSIDE OF PRESIDENT
GARFIELD'S CHAMBER POT.

02:27.268 --> 02:28.898
IF I MAY, YOU SEEM A LITTLE

02:28.899 --> 02:29.939
OUT OF SORTS OVER

02:29.940 --> 02:30.980
THIS DINNER WITH ALISTAIR.

02:30.981 --> 02:32.322
WELL, EVERYTHING MUST BE PERFECT

02:32.323 --> 02:33.863
TONIGHT SO THAT HE WILL PROPOSE.

02:33.864 --> 02:36.446
PROPOSE? BUT YOU DON'T LOVE HIM.

02:36.447 --> 02:38.908
WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT?

02:38.909 --> 02:40.450
WITHOUT HIS FAMILY'S FORTUNE,

02:40.451 --> 02:41.581
THE CREDITORS WILL FORECLOSE

02:41.582 --> 02:43.283
ON BURKEWOOD IN TWO DAYS.

02:43.284 --> 02:44.414
I MUST DO SOMETHING

02:44.415 --> 02:45.705
TO SAVE OUR BELOVED HOME.

02:45.706 --> 02:47.917
MELANIE, ARE YOU THERE?

02:47.918 --> 02:49.879
SHH. FATHER MUST NOT
KNOW OF OUR DIRE STATE.

02:49.880 --> 02:53.963
CHILD, I AM FILLED
WITH CHRISTMAS CHEER.

02:53.964 --> 02:56.886
WELL, CHRISTMAS
CHEER AND SCOTCH.

02:56.887 --> 02:59.929
WELL, IT IS SO GOOD
TO SEE YOU SMILING.

02:59.930 --> 03:02.222
YES, IT MUST BE GOOD TO SEE...

03:02.223 --> 03:03.644
AT ALL.

03:05.015 --> 03:08.067
TELL ME, CHILD, ARE YOU SMILING?

03:08.068 --> 03:10.070
WELL, OF COURSE I AM.

03:11.732 --> 03:14.023
I FIND CHRISTMAS A SAD TIME.

03:14.024 --> 03:16.946
IT WAS 10 YEARS AGO
THIS VERY NIGHT THAT

03:16.947 --> 03:20.740
YOUR SAINTED MOTHER DIED, AND
I WENT BLIND FROM GRIEF.

03:20.741 --> 03:22.532
WHO KNEW...

03:22.533 --> 03:25.915
THAT TOO MUCH CRYING COULD
CAUSE A MAN TO LOSE HIS SIGHT?

03:25.916 --> 03:27.957
I ASSURE YOU THERE
WAS NOTHING ELSE

03:27.958 --> 03:29.459
I WAS DOING TOO MUCH OF

03:29.460 --> 03:31.001
THAT COULD HAVE CAUSED
THIS BLINDNESS.

03:33.133 --> 03:34.334
STRANGE, I DON'T HEAR

03:34.335 --> 03:35.795
THE SERVANTS BUSTLING ABOUT.

03:35.796 --> 03:37.547
OH, UH, THAT'S BECAUSE

03:37.548 --> 03:38.678
ALL THE SERVANTS ARE

03:38.679 --> 03:39.679
NOCTURNAL NOW.

03:39.680 --> 03:40.890
YEAH, THEY WORK

03:40.891 --> 03:41.931
WHILE YOU'RE ASLEEP.

03:41.932 --> 03:44.394
OH, SO LIKE ELVES.

03:44.395 --> 03:46.397
EXACTLY.

03:47.978 --> 03:49.018
MISS MELANIE.

03:49.019 --> 03:50.560
Melanie: OH, JOSIAH,
YOUR ARMS...

03:50.561 --> 03:53.443
I MEAN, YOU'RE HERE.

03:53.444 --> 03:56.696
MISS MELANIE, I HAVE SOME
VERY UPSETTING NEWS.

03:56.697 --> 03:58.408
AND AFTER YOU HEAR IT,
YOU MAY WISH TO SIT.

03:58.409 --> 03:59.489
OF COURSE, THAT WILL REQUIRE YOU

03:59.490 --> 04:01.531
TO PUT ON YOUR
SITTING DRESS, SO...

04:01.532 --> 04:03.453
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'LL
JUST TELL YOU.

04:03.454 --> 04:06.536
THE BUTCHERS REFUSE TO SELL US ANY
MEAT FOR THE CHRISTMAS ROAST.

04:06.537 --> 04:07.917
- ( gasps )
- WHY ON EARTH

04:07.918 --> 04:09.959
WOULD THE BUTCHER
REFUSE OUR MONEY?

04:09.960 --> 04:12.832
AFTER ALL, WE ARE THE RICHEST
FAMILY IN THE COUNTY.

04:12.833 --> 04:14.424
COLONEL BURKE, I
DIDN'T SEE YOU THERE.

04:14.425 --> 04:16.377
WELCOME TO MY WORLD.

04:18.719 --> 04:20.300
LISBETH, WHY DON'T
YOU TAKE FATHER OUT

04:20.301 --> 04:22.261
TO HIS CHAIR BY THE DUCK
POND THAT HE LOVES SO MUCH.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.933
OH, YES, OF COURSE,

04:23.934 --> 04:26.766
'CAUSE WE STILL HAVE A DUCK POND
WITH MANY, MANY HEALTHY DUCKS.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.978
OH, I CAN HEAR THEM NOW.

04:28.979 --> 04:29.979
QUACK, QUACK, QUACK.

04:29.980 --> 04:32.852
MY DUCKS.

04:32.853 --> 04:34.894
( sighs )

04:34.895 --> 04:35.945
NO ROAST?

04:35.946 --> 04:37.527
BUT TONIGHT'S DINNER
MUST BE PERFECT

04:37.528 --> 04:39.238
OR BURKEWOOD WILL BE
SHUTTERED FOREVER.

04:39.239 --> 04:41.491
BREAKS MY HEART TO SEE YOU
SO UPSET, MISS MELANIE.

04:41.492 --> 04:43.323
AS GOD AS MY WITNESS, I
WILL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES

04:43.324 --> 04:45.284
TO FIND YOU THAT ROAST
FOR TONIGHT'S MEAL.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.826
AND THEN I SHALL COOK IT.

04:46.827 --> 04:47.907
( gasps )

04:47.908 --> 04:49.869
BUT HOW WILL YOU HAVE
TIME TO PREPARE THE MEAL?

04:49.870 --> 04:51.831
AND WON'T YOU BE TOO BUSY
LOOKING AFTER THE HORSES?

04:51.832 --> 04:55.124
I'M AFRAID WE SOLD
OFF ALL THE HORSES.

04:55.125 --> 04:56.676
WELL, EXCEPT FOR SILVER BELLS

04:56.677 --> 04:59.008
'CAUSE YOU KNOW, HE'S
JUST TOO OLD AND FRAIL.

04:59.009 --> 05:00.299
AW, SILVER BELLS.

05:00.300 --> 05:03.513
REMEMBER AS CHILDREN,
WHEN WE WOULD SNEAK OFF

05:03.514 --> 05:04.924
FOR A MIDNIGHT GALLOP?

05:04.925 --> 05:07.016
HOW COULD I FORGET?

05:07.017 --> 05:08.228
( sighs )

05:13.354 --> 05:15.565
I SHOULD GO START
COOKING DINNER.

05:15.566 --> 05:16.816
( clears throat )

05:16.817 --> 05:20.610
I'M GONNA TAKE THIS CHAIR
IF YOU DON'T MIND...

05:20.611 --> 05:22.443
AS WE ARE SHORT ON FIREWOOD.

05:26.447 --> 05:28.708
OH, NOW I UNDERSTAND.

05:28.709 --> 05:30.830
HE IS THE ONE YOU REALLY LOVE.

05:30.831 --> 05:31.831
WHO, JOSIAH?

05:31.832 --> 05:33.753
THE HANDSOME STABLE
HAND WHO I GREW UP WITH

05:33.754 --> 05:34.914
AND HAVE SO MUCH IN COMMON WITH?

05:34.915 --> 05:37.627
WELL, SOMEONE TREAT THIS ONE
WITH SOME STATIC ELECTRICITY,

05:37.628 --> 05:39.379
BECAUSE THAT IS JUST MADNESS.

05:39.380 --> 05:41.301
UH-HUH.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.676
OH, YOU FOUND A ROAST.

05:46.677 --> 05:49.018
HOW DID YOU CONVINCE THE
BUTCHER TO EXTEND US CREDIT?

05:49.019 --> 05:50.601
IT'S NOT FOR YOU TO WORRY
ABOUT, YOUNG LADY.

05:52.232 --> 05:53.603
VERY WELL, THEN.

05:53.604 --> 05:54.934
I'LL JUST GO THROW A
BLANKET OVER SILVER BELLS.

05:54.935 --> 05:58.528
NO. THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY,

05:58.529 --> 06:00.280
AS SILVER BELLS WILL BE...

06:01.321 --> 06:03.153
QUITE WARM TONIGHT.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.077
YOU MEAN...

06:11.452 --> 06:14.293
YOU WON'T REVEAL THE SECRET INGREDIENT
FOR TONIGHT'S MEAL, WILL YOU?

06:14.294 --> 06:15.995
NAY.

06:15.996 --> 06:17.758
"NEIGH"?

06:21.131 --> 06:23.383
THOSE WERE SILVER
BELLS' LAST WORDS.

06:25.506 --> 06:28.428
IT'S JUST THAT I WOULD HAVE DONE
ANYTHING TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS

06:28.429 --> 06:31.010
CHRISTMAS FEAST WAS EXACTLY THE
WAY MISS MELANIE WANTED IT TO BE.

06:31.011 --> 06:34.564
WELL DON'T YOU KNOW WHY TONIGHT'S
DINNER IS SO IMPORTANT TO MELANIE?

06:34.565 --> 06:36.856
SHE WANTS ALISTAIR TO PROPOSE.

06:36.857 --> 06:39.479
- IS THIS TRUE?
- YES, BUT SHE DOESN'T LOVE HIM.

06:39.480 --> 06:40.730
YOU MUST STOP IT.

06:40.731 --> 06:42.612
I HAVE A GREAT IDEA.

06:42.613 --> 06:44.524
I'LL TELL ALISTAIR THAT
I'M A VEGETARIAN...

06:44.525 --> 06:47.286
THAT'S A NEW DIET THAT ALL
THE POOR PEOPLE ARE DOING.

06:47.287 --> 06:50.910
OH, PHEW, YOU FOUND A ROAST.

06:50.911 --> 06:54.293
LISTEN, MISS MELANIE,
BEFORE ALISTAIR ARRIVES...

06:54.294 --> 06:56.205
YES, JOSIAH?

06:56.206 --> 06:58.838
...THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU NEED TO KNOW.

06:58.839 --> 06:59.839
( horse whinnies )

06:59.840 --> 07:02.001
OH, ALISTAIR'S HERE.

07:02.002 --> 07:03.252
OH, HOW DO I LOOK?

07:03.253 --> 07:05.676
DOES THIS BUSTLE MAKE MY
BOTTOM LOOK ENORMOUS?

07:08.098 --> 07:09.510
OH, YEAH.

07:10.891 --> 07:11.891
Melanie: OH, GOOD.

07:11.892 --> 07:13.012
THEN I'M OFF TO GREET...

07:13.013 --> 07:15.015
MY FUTURE HUSBAND.

07:24.154 --> 07:25.525
MEL, I HAVE TO SAY

07:25.526 --> 07:27.827
I FIND ONE PART OF THAT
STORY HARD TO BELIEVE.

07:27.828 --> 07:28.908
WHICH PART?

07:28.909 --> 07:31.160
THE WHOLE THING.

07:31.161 --> 07:33.993
HEY. WE GOT OUR LAST-MINUTE
CHRISTMAS SHOPPING DONE.

07:33.994 --> 07:36.836
AND RYDER WRESTLED A SMALL
CHILD OVER A HIGHLANDER TOY.

07:36.837 --> 07:38.748
AND WON.

07:38.749 --> 07:41.541
OOH, OOH, OOH. CAN I PUT THE
SILVER STAR ON TOP OF THE TREE?

07:41.542 --> 07:44.544
UH, NO. ACTUALLY, WE HAVEN'T DECIDED WHICH
ORNAMENT IS GONNA BE GOING ON TOP OF THE TREE.

07:44.545 --> 07:46.756
YOUR AUNT MEL'S TRYING TO
CONVINCE ME THIS SILVER STAR

07:46.757 --> 07:49.509
HOLDS SOME SPECIAL PLACE
IN BURKE FAMILY HISTORY.

07:49.510 --> 07:50.850
REALLY? I'VE NEVER HEARD THAT.

07:50.851 --> 07:52.892
WELL, THEN YOU TWO
SHOULD SIT DOWN

07:52.893 --> 07:54.804
AND HEAR THIS STORY ABOUT
YOUR GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.

07:54.805 --> 07:56.355
NO, WAIT. SHE WAS MY
GREAT-GREAT-GRANDMOTHER,

07:56.356 --> 07:57.937
WHICH WOULD MAKE HER YOUR
GREAT-GREAT-GREAT...

07:57.938 --> 07:59.940
WHATEVER. SHE WAS AWESOME, OKAY?

08:03.564 --> 08:05.905
HERE, ALISTAIR. SIT NEXT TO ME.

08:05.906 --> 08:07.907
IT WOULD BE MY PLEASURE,
MISS MELANIE.

08:07.908 --> 08:09.909
HERE'S YOUR ROAST, SIR.

08:09.910 --> 08:12.662
( chuckles ) TELL ME, ALISTAIR,

08:12.663 --> 08:15.536
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN GRANDER
CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS?

08:17.958 --> 08:20.000
A... ACTUALLY I HAVE.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.623
OH, GOOD ONE. ( chuckles )

08:25.505 --> 08:27.216
YOU MUST SAY SOMETHING
TO MELANIE.

08:27.217 --> 08:28.678
SHE CAN'T MARRY ALISTAIR.

08:28.679 --> 08:29.799
AH, LOOK AT HIM.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.761
HE'S WAY TOO SHY TO
ASK FOR HER HAND.

08:31.762 --> 08:33.132
( Melanie giggles )

08:33.133 --> 08:35.094
WELL, MELANIE MIGHT ASK HIM.

08:35.095 --> 08:37.056
SHE'S A BOLD WOMAN ON THE
CUSP OF A NEW CENTURY.

08:37.057 --> 08:38.688
( gasps ) THE OTHER DAY,

08:38.689 --> 08:40.980
SHE WORE A DRESS THAT SHOWED
ALMOST HER ENTIRE ANKLE.

08:40.981 --> 08:43.774
OH. HER BARE ANKLE?

08:46.066 --> 08:48.068
I'LL BE BANKING THAT
IMAGE FOR LATER.

08:49.950 --> 08:53.203
MY, I'M SO HUNGRY I
COULD EAT A HORSE.

09:02.082 --> 09:03.713
THE ZIPPER HASN'T
BEEN INVENTED YET,

09:03.714 --> 09:05.666
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THAT GESTURE MEANS.

09:10.430 --> 09:12.341
WELL, THAT WAS QUITE A FEAST.

09:12.342 --> 09:13.342
OH, THAT?

09:13.343 --> 09:14.513
WELL, THAT'S WHAT WE EAT

09:14.514 --> 09:15.765
WHEN WE DON'T CARE
WHAT PEOPLE THINK.

09:15.766 --> 09:17.266
HMM.

09:17.267 --> 09:19.018
IT IS BEAUTIFUL OUT HERE.

09:19.019 --> 09:20.309
MMM, AND IT ALL BELONGS TO ME...

09:20.310 --> 09:21.891
AND WHOMEVER I MARRY.

09:21.892 --> 09:24.734
WELL, JUST THE OTHER DAY I
WAS SAYING TO MY HUSBAND...

09:24.735 --> 09:26.065
OH, DID I SAY HUSBAND?

09:26.066 --> 09:28.818
I MEANT, FATHER. I
DON'T HAVE A HUSBAND.

09:28.819 --> 09:30.359
PERHAPS I WILL SOMEDAY.

09:30.360 --> 09:32.451
HAVE A FATHER?

09:32.452 --> 09:34.954
NO, SILLY, A HUSBAND.

09:34.955 --> 09:36.575
TELL ME, JOSIAH,

09:36.576 --> 09:39.499
WHAT ARE MELANIE AND ALISTAIR
UP TO ON THE VERANDA?

09:40.961 --> 09:42.793
AT THE MOMENT, SIR, THEY ARE...

09:43.834 --> 09:47.506
HAVING POLITE... INTERCOURSE.

09:47.507 --> 09:51.260
DESCRIBE THEIR
INTERCOURSE TO ME.

09:51.261 --> 09:52.341
WELL, SIR,

09:52.342 --> 09:55.845
RIGHT NOW, MISS MELANIE
IS LAUGHING...

09:55.846 --> 09:57.677
AS ONLY SHE CAN.

09:57.678 --> 10:00.980
HERE SHE PLAYFULLY
TOSSES HER HAIR

10:00.981 --> 10:02.932
AND HER EYES SHINE SO BRIGHT.

10:02.933 --> 10:05.895
OH, DO ME A FAVOR,
GOOD JOSIAH...

10:05.896 --> 10:08.649
LAUGH AS SHE IS LAUGHING.

10:14.574 --> 10:16.115
SIR, I DON'T WANT TO...

10:16.116 --> 10:18.118
( stutters ) I-I AM YOUR BOSS.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.161
YES, SIR.

10:22.162 --> 10:23.913
UM...

10:23.914 --> 10:25.915
( feminine giggle )

10:25.916 --> 10:27.797
OH.

10:27.798 --> 10:29.839
( feminine giggle )

10:29.840 --> 10:31.630
( feminine giggle )

10:31.631 --> 10:33.552
WHY, ALISTAIR,

10:33.553 --> 10:35.755
YOU LOOK AS THOUGH
YOU'RE GONNA KISS ME.

10:35.756 --> 10:37.807
I DO? OH NO, I WOULDN'T PRESUME

10:37.808 --> 10:39.018
TO DO SUCH A THING, MA'AM.

10:39.019 --> 10:40.349
WELL, I WOULDN'T
MIND IF YOU DID...

10:40.350 --> 10:42.021
NOT THAT I KNOW
MUCH ABOUT KISSING,

10:42.022 --> 10:43.022
BUT FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN

10:43.023 --> 10:44.353
AT THE MAGIC LANTERN SHOW,

10:44.354 --> 10:46.356
IT GOES A LITTLE
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

10:49.980 --> 10:52.902
W-WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW?

10:52.903 --> 10:54.113
I COULD TELL YOU, SIR,

10:54.114 --> 10:55.484
BUT THEN I'D HAVE TO
GOUGE OUT MY EYES,

10:55.485 --> 10:57.907
RIP OFF MY EARS, AND
CUT OUT MY TONGUE.

10:57.908 --> 10:59.118
WELL, IN THAT CASE,

10:59.119 --> 11:00.490
SKIP IT.

11:03.583 --> 11:04.704
WOW.

11:04.705 --> 11:06.786
WELL, IF WE WERE
HUSBAND AND WIFE,

11:06.787 --> 11:09.129
WE COULD DO THAT EVERY SUNDAY.

11:10.791 --> 11:12.752
REALLY?

11:12.753 --> 11:13.753
THEN LET'S GET MARRIED.

11:13.754 --> 11:15.174
( gasps ) OH, ALISTAIR,

11:15.175 --> 11:17.056
SAY IT AGAIN. BUT THIS TIME,

11:17.057 --> 11:18.677
WHILE PICKING UP
MY HANDKERCHIEF.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.179
OKAY, NOW BEND THAT KNEE.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.560
YEAH, RIGHT THERE.

11:21.561 --> 11:23.222
OKAY, AND NOW SAY IT.

11:23.223 --> 11:26.565
MELANIE, WILL YOU MARRY ME?

11:26.566 --> 11:27.897
( gasps ) OH, ALISTAIR,

11:27.898 --> 11:28.979
THIS IS SUCH A SURPRISE.

11:34.654 --> 11:35.905
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:35.906 --> 11:36.906
PUTTING AWAY LEFTOVERS.

11:36.907 --> 11:39.779
SILVER BELLS WAS A
FINE OLD STALLION.

11:39.780 --> 11:41.530
SHOULD LAST US THE
REST OF THE WINTER.

11:41.531 --> 11:43.913
NO, I MEAN WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

11:43.914 --> 11:45.915
YOU HAVE TO TELL MELANIE
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT HER,

11:45.916 --> 11:47.706
OTHERWISE SHE'LL WIND
UP WITH THE WRONG MAN.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.829
AND WHEN YOU DIE, THEY'LL
WRITE UPON YOUR GRAVESTONE,

11:49.830 --> 11:54.003
"HERE LIES JOSIAH. HE DIED SAD
AND ALONE, BUT HE HAD HIS PRIDE.

11:54.004 --> 11:56.006
"SO THERE'S THAT."

11:58.428 --> 11:59.969
YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:59.970 --> 12:01.971
YOU'RE RIGHT.

12:01.972 --> 12:03.142
YOU'RE PRETTY WISE
FOR AN URCHIN.

12:03.143 --> 12:05.936
OH, WELL, I WAS FIRST IN
MY CLASS AT URCHIN SCHOOL.

12:07.517 --> 12:09.189
I'M GONNA GO TELL MISS
MELANIE THE TRUTH.

12:10.480 --> 12:11.901
ALISTAIR HAS ASKED
ME TO MARRY HIM,

12:11.902 --> 12:13.312
AND I SAID YES.

12:13.313 --> 12:15.484
YES, YES, YES, YES, YES.

12:15.485 --> 12:17.656
THAT IS WONDERFUL NEWS.

12:17.657 --> 12:20.030
JOSIAH, BREAK OUT OUR
FINEST CHAMPAGNE.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.035
( cheek pops )

12:26.036 --> 12:28.457
THAT'S SOMETHING I LEARNED
TO DO ON THE CONTINENT.

12:28.458 --> 12:29.458
OH.

12:29.459 --> 12:30.579
WE SHOULD BE MARRIED TONIGHT.

12:30.580 --> 12:32.832
I WILL RIDE HOME AND
RETRIEVE MY FATHER

12:32.833 --> 12:34.964
AND THE YOUNG VICAR
FROM OUR PARRISH,

12:34.965 --> 12:37.216
AND THEN YOU AND I CAN DO SOME
MORE OF THAT KISSING STUFF,

12:37.217 --> 12:38.217
- RIGHT?
- MM-HMM.

12:38.218 --> 12:39.298
OOH. ( chuckles )

12:39.299 --> 12:40.760
( clears throat )

12:41.932 --> 12:43.433
CONGRATULATIONS, MISS MELANIE.

12:44.434 --> 12:48.188
MELANIE, YOU MUST BE THRILLED.

12:51.021 --> 12:52.441
SHE'S BEHIND YOU.

12:52.442 --> 12:53.442
SO SORRY.

12:53.443 --> 12:56.445
DEAR, DEAR. OH, MY CHI...

12:56.446 --> 12:57.736
WHY...

12:57.737 --> 12:59.949
ARE THOSE TEARS ON YOUR FACE?

12:59.950 --> 13:02.531
YES, FATHER. TEARS OF
JOY AND NOTHING ELSE.

13:02.532 --> 13:05.825
FOR I AM SOON TO BE MRS.
ALISTAIR...

13:05.826 --> 13:07.867
WHATEVER HIS LAST NAME IS.
HE'S RICH.

13:07.868 --> 13:09.870
- ( sobs )
- ( laughs )

13:13.503 --> 13:14.793
JOSIAH,

13:14.794 --> 13:16.545
THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ALL
YOUR HELP TONIGHT.

13:16.546 --> 13:18.377
THIS PROPOSAL WOULDN'T
HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT YOU.

13:18.378 --> 13:20.299
YOU'RE WELCOME, MISS MELANIE.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.760
ALTHOUGH, DON'T EXPECT

13:21.761 --> 13:22.972
MY ASSISTANCE ON
YOUR HONEYMOON, NOW.

13:22.973 --> 13:24.594
( both chuckle )

13:28.348 --> 13:29.518
LISTEN, MISS MELANIE.

13:29.519 --> 13:31.270
SINCE BURKEWOOD IS NOW SAVED,

13:31.271 --> 13:32.601
I WANT YOU TO KNOW

13:32.602 --> 13:34.984
THIS'LL BE MY LAST
DAY IN YOUR SERVICE.

13:34.985 --> 13:36.986
WELL, DON'T I GET A
FORTNIGHT'S NOTICE?

13:36.987 --> 13:39.990
IF YOU WERE PAYING ME, YES.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.441
BUT BEFORE I GO,

13:42.442 --> 13:44.034
I ACTUALLY WANT TO
GIVE YOU SOMETHING.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.827
I FORGED THIS WITH
MY BARE HANDS.

13:48.828 --> 13:52.001
I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU COULD
HANG IT ON THE CHRISTMAS TREE

13:52.002 --> 13:53.542
TO REMEMBER ME BY.

13:53.543 --> 13:56.876
OH, WHAT A BEAUTIFUL
SILVER STAR.

13:56.877 --> 13:57.917
( sighs )

13:57.918 --> 13:59.508
PALES IN COMPARISON TO THE
LADY WHO'S HOLDING IT.

13:59.509 --> 14:00.921
( sighs )

14:03.173 --> 14:04.173
( both inhale sharply )

14:04.174 --> 14:05.594
- NOW...
- ( exhales )

14:05.595 --> 14:07.766
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

14:07.767 --> 14:10.059
I'M GONNA GO SHOVEL THE REST
OF THE MANURE BEFORE I LEAVE.

14:10.060 --> 14:11.810
( sighs ) WELL, DON'T GO!

14:11.811 --> 14:12.812
DON'T GO?

14:14.564 --> 14:16.685
SHOVEL THE REST OF THE MANURE?

14:16.686 --> 14:20.649
YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY GO SHOVEL THE MANURE,

14:20.650 --> 14:22.652
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.035
THANK YOU, JOSIAH.

14:26.036 --> 14:27.247
( sighs )

14:28.408 --> 14:29.409
( sighs )

14:30.410 --> 14:32.411
OH, WHERE DID YOU GET
THAT PRETTY STAR?

14:32.412 --> 14:34.623
JOSIAH MADE IT FOR ME.

14:34.624 --> 14:36.957
HE HAS TAKEN HIS LEAVE TONIGHT
OF BURKEWOOD FOREVER.

14:38.548 --> 14:41.420
JOSIAH MEANS A GREAT DEAL TO
YOU, DOESN'T HE, MISS MELANIE?

14:41.421 --> 14:42.962
WHY?

14:42.963 --> 14:45.674
BECAUSE WE SPENT OUR IDYLLIC
YOUTH PLAYING COUNTRY PHYSICIAN?

14:45.675 --> 14:47.636
PISH POSH.

14:47.637 --> 14:52.012
PERHAPS SOME NIGHT AIR WILL HELP
DRY THESE TEARS OF NOT CARING.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.225
( clock chimes )

14:56.226 --> 15:00.019
I HEAR FAINT CHIMES FROM
ACROSS THE TOWN SQUARE.

15:00.020 --> 15:02.022
THAT MEANS IT'S CHRISTMAS.

15:03.363 --> 15:04.944
( exhales deeply )

15:04.945 --> 15:06.405
OH, MISS MELANIE,

15:06.406 --> 15:07.736
LOOK AT THAT BRIGHT STAR.

15:07.737 --> 15:09.828
PERHAPS THAT'S THE SAME
STAR THE WISE MEN SAW.

15:09.829 --> 15:10.869
PERHAPS.

15:10.870 --> 15:12.952
IF YOU WISH UPON A STAR...

15:12.953 --> 15:14.334
( star twinkles )

15:17.707 --> 15:20.339
GREAT CAESAR'S GHOST!

15:20.340 --> 15:23.752
MY SIGHT HAS BEEN RESTORED!

15:23.753 --> 15:25.134
IT'S A CHRISTMAS MIRACLE.

15:25.135 --> 15:26.545
OH, FATHER, IS IT REALLY TRUE?

15:26.546 --> 15:27.546
YES!

15:27.547 --> 15:28.677
I CAN SEE.

15:28.678 --> 15:30.929
AND I CAN SEE IN YOUR EYES

15:30.930 --> 15:32.721
A DEEP SORROW.

15:32.722 --> 15:34.433
BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T
LOVE ALISTAIR.

15:34.434 --> 15:35.894
SHE IS IN LOVE WITH ANOTHER.

15:35.895 --> 15:37.817
SHUSH, CHILD, OR YOU'RE
BACK ON THE STREET.

15:39.269 --> 15:40.769
WELL, WHO IS IT?

15:40.770 --> 15:42.361
( sighs ) IT DOESN'T MATTER.

15:42.362 --> 15:43.983
I MUST MARRY ALISTAIR.

15:43.984 --> 15:45.444
OTHERWISE, BURKEWOOD IS LOST.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.236
WHY? WE ARE WEALTHY.

15:47.237 --> 15:49.198
OH, FATHER, I'M AFRAID NOT.

15:49.199 --> 15:50.660
LOOK AROUND YOU.

15:51.661 --> 15:52.871
OH DEAR GOD.

15:52.872 --> 15:54.744
THIS PLACE IS A DUMP.

15:55.915 --> 15:58.377
BUT WITH ALISTAIR'S FAMILY
MONEY, ALL WILL BE RESTORED.

15:58.378 --> 16:03.292
MY DEAR, YOU CANNOT SACRIFICE
YOUR HAPPINESS TO SAVE A HOUSE.

16:03.293 --> 16:05.964
YOU MUST MARRY THE MAN YOU LOVE.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.087
OH, FATHER, DO YOU
REALLY MEAN THAT?

16:08.088 --> 16:09.508
I DO.

16:09.509 --> 16:11.430
WHAT MEANS MOST TO
ME IN THIS WORLD

16:11.431 --> 16:13.303
IS YOUR HAPPINESS, MY CHILD.

16:14.724 --> 16:17.597
ALTHOUGH, IT WOULDN'T KILL
YOU TO PICK UP A BROOM.

16:18.768 --> 16:20.019
MISS MELANIE,

16:20.020 --> 16:21.401
I'M GONNA BE GOING NOW.

16:22.402 --> 16:23.813
I'VE MADE MY BED...

16:25.605 --> 16:27.156
INTO THIS STYLISH STRAW HAT

16:27.157 --> 16:28.818
IN CASE I GET A JOB
ON A RIVERBOAT.

16:29.819 --> 16:30.989
NICE HAT.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.741
I'LL BE SORRY TO SEE YOU GO.

16:32.742 --> 16:34.703
WAIT A MINUTE.

16:34.704 --> 16:36.115
COLONEL, YOU CAN SEE?

16:36.116 --> 16:38.618
YES, IT'S A CHRISTMAS MIRACLE.

16:39.619 --> 16:41.381
I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT IT LATER.

16:42.332 --> 16:43.923
FAREWELL, JOSIAH.

16:45.045 --> 16:46.966
FAREWELL, MISS MELANIE.

16:47.887 --> 16:49.798
UH-HUH.

16:49.799 --> 16:51.390
I KNOW THAT LOOK.

16:51.391 --> 16:54.223
THAT IS THE LOOK OF LOVE.

16:54.224 --> 16:55.844
YES.

16:55.845 --> 16:57.096
YES, IT'S TRUE.

16:57.097 --> 16:58.518
I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED JOSIAH.

16:59.519 --> 17:00.639
YOU HAVE?

17:00.640 --> 17:03.642
I CAN NO LONGER DENY
THAT I LOVE THIS

17:03.643 --> 17:06.024
DIRTY, SMELLY,
DESTITUTE STABLE HAND,

17:06.025 --> 17:08.148
WHO IS ALSO VERY
HANDSOME AND KIND.

17:09.819 --> 17:12.532
PERHAPS, LEAD WITH
THAT THE NEXT TIME.

17:14.204 --> 17:15.704
OH, MISS MELANIE, I'VE LOVED YOU

17:15.705 --> 17:16.915
EVER SINCE THE FIRST TIME

17:16.916 --> 17:17.997
THAT YOU AND I RODE
SILVER BELLS TOGETHER.

17:19.829 --> 17:20.919
IF THIS IS TO BE

17:20.920 --> 17:22.161
YOUR BRIDE, ALISTAIR,

17:22.162 --> 17:23.873
I THINK WE MAY HAVE A PROBLEM.

17:25.295 --> 17:27.546
IS THIS THE CHASTE ANGEL

17:27.547 --> 17:29.218
YOU'VE BEEN GOING
ON ABOUT, MY SON?

17:29.219 --> 17:30.969
IT IS.

17:30.970 --> 17:33.172
PARDON ME, STABLE BOY,

17:33.173 --> 17:35.885
BUT I BELIEVE THAT
BELONGS TO ME.

17:36.886 --> 17:39.228
OH, I BELONG TO NO ONE.

17:39.229 --> 17:40.439
I AM MY OWN WOMAN,

17:40.440 --> 17:41.770
AND I MAKE MY OWN CHOICES.

17:41.771 --> 17:42.941
I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO VOTE,

17:42.942 --> 17:44.523
I MAY NOT BE ABLE
TO HOLD OFFICE,

17:44.524 --> 17:45.814
I MAY NOT BE ABLE
TO SIGN A CONTRACT

17:45.815 --> 17:47.276
OR OPEN A BANK ACCOUNT...

17:47.277 --> 17:49.528
YOU ALSO CAN'T OWN PROPERTY
OR SMOKE TOBACCO IN PUBLIC.

17:49.529 --> 17:50.739
THANK YOU, SISTER.

17:50.740 --> 17:52.821
BUT I CAN CHOOSE THE MAN I LOVE.

17:52.822 --> 17:54.113
THAT'S RIGHT, AND SHE LOVES ME,

17:54.114 --> 17:55.864
SO I THINK IT'S TIME
THAT YOU MOVE ALONG,

17:55.865 --> 17:56.905
ALISTAIR.

17:56.906 --> 17:59.748
SO AM I TO PERFORM A
WEDDING CEREMONY, OR NOT?

17:59.749 --> 18:00.959
EITHER WAY,

18:00.960 --> 18:02.962
I WAS TOLD THERE
WOULD BE DINNER.

18:04.254 --> 18:07.876
I PROPOSE WE SETTLE
WHO GETS THE LADY

18:07.877 --> 18:10.260
WITH A MODERN-FASHIONED DUEL.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.263
- ( Melanie and Lisbeth gasp )
- EXCUSE ME.

18:18.017 --> 18:19.978
I SUPPOSE I'M GONNA GET
ONE OF THOSE, RIGHT?

18:19.979 --> 18:20.810
NOPE.

18:24.314 --> 18:26.025
A REAL GENTLEMAN, I SEE.

18:27.026 --> 18:28.027
( grunts )

18:29.729 --> 18:31.530
SOMEONE STOP THEM.
YOU'RE HIS FATHER.

18:31.531 --> 18:32.941
GO FOR HIS THROAT, ALISTAIR!

18:32.942 --> 18:34.863
AND DON'T GET BLOOD
ON YOUR SHIRT.

18:34.864 --> 18:36.996
YOUR MOTHER WILL BE VEXED.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.873
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY'RE
FIGHTING OVER ME.

18:44.874 --> 18:46.004
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY...

18:46.005 --> 18:48.007
FLATTERING.

18:52.462 --> 18:53.463
( grunting )

18:59.309 --> 19:00.469
( both grunting )

19:00.470 --> 19:01.470
Alistair's Father: STOP!

19:01.471 --> 19:03.932
THAT MARK, HOW DID YOU GET THAT?

19:03.933 --> 19:06.685
SIR, I WAS BORN THIS WAY

19:06.686 --> 19:08.897
MY ELDEST SON HAD SUCH A MARK.

19:08.898 --> 19:12.441
HE WAS STOLEN FROM US AS A BABE
BY TRAVELING FORTUNE TELLERS.

19:12.442 --> 19:13.982
I WAS RAISED BY TRAVELING
FORTUNE TELLERS

19:13.983 --> 19:15.194
AND NEVER TOLD OF MY TRUE BIRTH.

19:15.195 --> 19:17.777
THAT MEANS YOU TWO ARE BROTHERS!

19:21.581 --> 19:22.831
BROTHER?

19:22.832 --> 19:24.663
BROTHER!

19:24.664 --> 19:26.336
( both laughing joyously )

19:27.337 --> 19:29.288
FATHER, AT LAST!

19:29.289 --> 19:30.839
WHEN DO I GET TO MEET MOTHER?

19:30.840 --> 19:33.502
AS SOON AS SHE RETURNS FROM
FOLLOWING THAT HEARTTHROB

19:33.503 --> 19:36.175
JOHN PHILIP SOUSA ON
HIS CONCERT TOUR.

19:37.427 --> 19:38.467
JOSIAH,

19:38.468 --> 19:40.008
AS MY ELDEST SON,

19:40.009 --> 19:43.433
YOU ARE NOW HEIR TO
MY ENTIRE FORTUNE.

19:46.105 --> 19:47.936
PRIMOGENITURE IN YOUR FACE.

19:47.937 --> 19:51.150
WHAT? WELL, THAT SUCKS.

19:53.192 --> 19:56.815
WELL, THIS MEANS WE CAN BE MARRIED,
AND BURKEWOOD CAN BE SAVED.

19:56.816 --> 19:58.577
OH, AND TRUE LOVE HAS WON OUT!

19:58.578 --> 20:02.241
MY LADY, WOULD YOU DO ME THE
HONOR OF BEING MY WIFE?

20:02.242 --> 20:04.874
A THOUSAND TIMES, YES.

20:05.875 --> 20:08.707
SAVE IT FOR THE
CEREMONY, YOU TWO.

20:08.708 --> 20:11.500
YOUNG VICAR, WOULD YOU PLEASE
GET MY DAUGHTER HITCHED?

20:11.501 --> 20:12.881
Vicar: IT WOULD BE MY JOY

20:12.882 --> 20:15.294
AND PLEASURE TO JOIN THESE
TWO IN HOLY MATRIMONY...

20:15.295 --> 20:17.297
AS SOON AS I GET
SOMETHING TO EAT.

20:18.548 --> 20:19.968
( gasps ) I HAVE A GREAT IDEA.

20:19.969 --> 20:21.930
WE COULD RIDE SILVER
BELLS TOGETHER AGAIN,

20:21.931 --> 20:23.472
BUT THIS TIME DOWN THE AISLE.

20:23.473 --> 20:25.604
MY DEAR,

20:25.605 --> 20:28.016
THERE'S SOMETHING I SHOULD
TELL YOU ABOUT SILVER BELLS.

20:28.017 --> 20:29.018
( Lisbeth clears throat )

20:30.850 --> 20:32.522
IT CAN WAIT. ( chuckles )

20:39.158 --> 20:41.069
AND SO THAT NIGHT,
MELANIE AND JOSIAH

20:41.070 --> 20:43.862
WERE MARRIED BENEATH
THIS VERY SILVER STAR.

20:43.863 --> 20:45.033
AW.

20:45.034 --> 20:46.826
WHAT A ROMANTIC LOAD OF CRAP.

20:48.578 --> 20:49.788
WAIT, I DON'T GET IT.

20:49.789 --> 20:51.040
WHAT'S THE NAME OF
THIS MOVIE AGAIN?

20:52.672 --> 20:54.374
YOU BELIEVE ME, DON'T YOU, JOE?

20:55.875 --> 20:56.836
NOT EVEN A LITTLE.

20:56.837 --> 20:58.507
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, HONEY?

20:58.508 --> 21:00.088
I GOTTA TELL YOU THE
FACT THAT YOU WENT

21:00.089 --> 21:01.089
TO SUCH INCREDIBLE LENGTHS

21:01.090 --> 21:02.180
TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS STAR

21:02.181 --> 21:03.802
GETS THE TOP SPOT ON THIS TREE,

21:03.803 --> 21:05.474
IS BOTH WHAT I FIND

21:05.475 --> 21:06.885
MOST ANNOYING ABOUT YOU,

21:06.886 --> 21:07.887
AND YET...

21:08.938 --> 21:10.809
WHAT I LOVE MOST ABOUT YOU.

21:10.810 --> 21:11.810
AW, HONEY. LETTING ME

21:11.811 --> 21:12.811
HAVE MY WAY IS THE BEST

21:12.812 --> 21:13.893
CHRISTMAS PRESENT EVER.

21:14.894 --> 21:15.944
Joe: OH.

21:15.945 --> 21:17.446
WELL, THEN I THINK
MY SHOPPING IS DONE.

21:17.447 --> 21:19.278
NO. YOU STILL GOTTA
BUY ME STUFF.
