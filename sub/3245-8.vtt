00:03.003 --> 00:05.131
Peter Alan Tyler, my dad.

00:05.797 --> 00:08.016
The most wonderful man in the world.

00:08.090 --> 00:11.311
Born 15th September, 1954.

00:13.847 --> 00:16.065
Come here, Rose. Come here.

00:23.273 --> 00:26.197
Who's that? It's your daddy.

00:27.236 --> 00:30.080
You weren't old enough
to remember when he died.

00:30.864 --> 00:34.914
1987, 7th November.

00:34.993 --> 00:37.041
Do you remember
what I told you?

00:37.120 --> 00:40.670
The day that Stuart Hoskins
and Sarah Clark got married.

00:42.125 --> 00:44.253
He was always
having adventures.

00:45.087 --> 00:47.590
He would have loved
to have seen you now.

00:50.592 --> 00:52.811
That's what Mum always says.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.684
So I was thinking,

00:54.763 --> 00:58.643
could we go and see my dad
when he was still alive?

00:58.725 --> 01:00.693
Where's this come
from all of a sudden?

01:00.769 --> 01:04.069
All right, if we can't, if it goes
against the laws of time or something,

01:04.147 --> 01:05.569
then never mind, just leave it.

01:05.649 --> 01:08.903
No, I can do anything.
I'm just more worried about you.

01:08.986 --> 01:10.158
I want to see him.

01:10.237 --> 01:13.662
Your wish is my command.
But be careful what you wish for.

01:57.576 --> 01:59.829
I, Peter Alan Tyler,

01:59.911 --> 02:03.290
take you,
Jacqueline Andrea Suzette Prentice.

02:03.790 --> 02:06.134
I, Peter Alan Tyler,

02:06.251 --> 02:08.845
take you, Jacqueline...

02:08.961 --> 02:10.714
Susanne, Suzette...

02:11.965 --> 02:13.137
Anita?

02:17.638 --> 02:20.517
Just carry on.
It's good enough for Lady Di.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.647
I thought he'd be taller.

02:23.727 --> 02:28.779
To be my lawful wedded wife.
To love and behold till death us do part.

02:29.816 --> 02:32.035
He died so close to home.

02:32.819 --> 02:35.618
I wasn't there. Nobody was.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.413
It was a hit-and-run driver.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.957
Never found out who.

02:42.120 --> 02:44.589
He was dead
when the ambulance got there.

02:45.582 --> 02:48.506
I only wish there'd been
someone there for him.

02:53.548 --> 02:56.927
I want to be that someone.
So he doesn't die alone.

02:57.386 --> 02:59.935
- November 7th?
- 'I 987.

03:25.872 --> 03:28.000
It's so weird.

03:28.083 --> 03:29.801
The day my father died.

03:31.211 --> 03:35.091
I thought it'd be all sort of grim and stormy.
It's just an ordinary day.

03:35.173 --> 03:37.847
The past is another country.

03:37.926 --> 03:40.179
1987 is just the Isle of Wight.

03:42.139 --> 03:44.107
- You sure about this?
- Yeah.

03:57.279 --> 03:59.156
This is it. Jordan Road.

04:00.699 --> 04:02.622
He was late.

04:02.784 --> 04:05.788
He'd been to get a wedding present,
a vase.

04:06.705 --> 04:09.003
Mum always said,
"That stupid vase."

04:13.462 --> 04:15.760
He got out of his car...

04:16.882 --> 04:18.725
and crossed the road.

04:19.968 --> 04:22.016
Oh, God, this is it.

04:43.158 --> 04:45.160
Go to him. Quick.

04:55.003 --> 04:56.471
It's too late now.

04:58.256 --> 05:01.180
By the time the ambulance got there,
he was dead.

05:06.556 --> 05:08.308
He can't die on his own.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.353
Can I try again?

05:23.698 --> 05:26.076
Right, that's the first you and me.

05:26.201 --> 05:29.296
It's a very bad idea, two sets of us
being here at the same time.

05:29.371 --> 05:31.590
Just be careful
they don't see us.

05:31.665 --> 05:35.010
Wait till she runs off and he follows
then go to your dad.

05:45.303 --> 05:47.271
Oh, God, this is it.

05:54.145 --> 05:55.362
I can't do this.

05:55.438 --> 05:57.532
You don't have to do anything
you don't want to.

05:57.607 --> 06:00.201
But this is the last
time we can be here.

06:03.154 --> 06:04.451
Rose, no!

06:18.712 --> 06:21.340
I did it. I saved your life.

06:21.423 --> 06:24.222
Blimey, did you see the speed of it?
Did you get his number?

06:24.301 --> 06:28.056
I really did it.
Oh, my God, look at you, you're alive.

06:28.138 --> 06:29.640
That car was gonna kill you.

06:29.723 --> 06:33.523
Give me some credit, I did see it coming.
I wasn't gonna walk under it, was I?

06:33.602 --> 06:35.400
I'm Rose.

06:38.356 --> 06:40.529
That's a coincidence.
That's my daughter's name.

06:41.484 --> 06:44.658
That's a great name.
Good choice. Well done.

06:49.492 --> 06:51.915
Right. I better shift.
I've got a wedding to go to.

06:51.995 --> 06:54.623
- Is that Sarah Clark's wedding?
- Yeah. Are you going?

06:54.706 --> 06:55.753
Yeah.

06:55.916 --> 06:58.294
Do you and your
boyfriend need a lift?

07:09.804 --> 07:11.977
Right, there we go,
sorry about the mess.

07:12.057 --> 07:15.607
If you want a cup of tea,
kitchen's down there, milk's in the fridge.

07:15.685 --> 07:18.905
It would be, wouldn't it?
Where else would you put the milk?

07:18.980 --> 07:21.483
Mind you, there's always
the windowsill outside.

07:21.566 --> 07:25.241
I always thought if someone invented
a windowsill with special compartments,

07:25.320 --> 07:27.197
one for milk, one for yoghurt,

07:27.280 --> 07:31.001
make a lot of money out of that.
Sell it to students and things.

07:32.744 --> 07:34.087
I should write that down.

07:34.162 --> 07:37.211
Anyway, never mind that.
Excuse me, I got to go and change.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.967
All the stuff Mum kept.
His stuff.

07:43.838 --> 07:46.307
She kept it all packed away
in boxes in the cupboard.

07:46.383 --> 07:49.353
She used to show me
when she'd had a bit to drink.

07:49.678 --> 07:52.522
Here it is, on display.

07:53.682 --> 07:55.776
Where it should be.

07:59.437 --> 08:03.237
Third prize at the bowling.
First two got to go to Didcot.

08:05.860 --> 08:07.157
Health drinks.

08:07.237 --> 08:09.615
Tonics Mum used to call them.

08:09.698 --> 08:11.826
He made his money
selling this Vitex stuff.

08:11.908 --> 08:14.002
He had all sorts of jobs,
he was so clever.

08:17.080 --> 08:20.584
Solar power.
Mum said he was going to do this.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.010
Now he can.

08:25.505 --> 08:28.099
Okay, I'll tell him
you're not my boyfriend.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.347
When we met I said,
"Travel with me in space."

08:30.427 --> 08:31.553
You said, "No."

08:31.636 --> 08:33.354
Then I said, "Time machine."

08:33.429 --> 08:34.898
It wasn't some big plan.

08:34.972 --> 08:39.443
I just saw it happening,
and I thought, "I can stop it."

08:41.479 --> 08:43.823
I did it again.
I picked another stupid ape.

08:43.898 --> 08:47.402
I should have known. It's not about
showing you the universe. It never is.

08:47.485 --> 08:49.783
It's about the universe
doing something for you.

08:49.863 --> 08:53.163
So it's okay when you go to other times
and you save people's lives

08:53.241 --> 08:54.914
but not when it's
me saving my dad?

08:54.993 --> 08:56.620
I know what I'm doing,
you don't.

08:56.703 --> 08:59.331
Two sets of us being there
made that a vulnerable point.

08:59.414 --> 09:00.586
But he's alive.

09:00.665 --> 09:02.838
My entire planet died,
my whole family.

09:02.917 --> 09:05.670
Do you think it never occurred to me
to go back and save them?

09:05.754 --> 09:07.973
But it's not like
I've changed history.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.345
Not much. I mean,

09:09.424 --> 09:13.474
he's never gonna be a world leader,
he's not gonna start World War III.

09:13.553 --> 09:16.807
Rose, there's a man alive in the world
who wasn't alive before.

09:16.890 --> 09:20.019
An ordinary man. That's the most
important thing in creation.

09:20.101 --> 09:22.399
The whole world's different
because he's alive.

09:22.479 --> 09:24.857
- Would you rather him dead?
- I'm not saying that...

09:24.939 --> 09:28.193
No, I get it. For once, you're not
the most important man in my life.

09:28.276 --> 09:31.155
Let's see how you get on without me.
Give me the key.

09:31.237 --> 09:33.990
The Tardis key.
If I'm so insignificant, give it me back.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.701
All right then, I will.

09:35.784 --> 09:38.754
You've got what you wanted
so that's goodbye, then.

09:40.038 --> 09:42.507
You don't scare me.

09:42.582 --> 09:45.552
I know how sad you are.
You'll be back in a minute.

09:45.668 --> 09:48.922
Or you'll hang around
outside the Tardis waiting for me.

09:49.255 --> 09:51.599
And I'll make you
wait a long time.

09:58.389 --> 09:59.857
Boyfriend trouble?

10:47.814 --> 10:50.283
Excuse me, do you mind?
What are you tidying up for?

10:50.358 --> 10:52.486
Sorry, force of habit.

10:52.694 --> 10:55.538
Don't worry about him.
Couples have rows all the time.

10:55.613 --> 10:59.038
We're not a couple.
Why does everyone think we're a couple?

11:01.202 --> 11:04.081
- I think he left me.
- What? A pretty girl like you?

11:04.164 --> 11:06.542
- If I was going out with you...
- Stop right there.

11:06.624 --> 11:07.671
I'm just saying...

11:07.750 --> 11:10.173
I know what you're saying
and we're not going there.

11:10.253 --> 11:13.632
At no point are we going
anywhere near there.

11:13.715 --> 11:16.935
You aren't even aware
that there exists...

11:17.010 --> 11:19.980
I don't want to think about there and,
believe me, neither do you.

11:20.054 --> 11:23.775
There, for you, is like...

11:23.850 --> 11:25.693
like the Bermuda Triangle.

11:26.227 --> 11:29.652
- Blimey, you know how to flatter a bloke.
- Right. Are we off?

11:29.731 --> 11:33.235
- That wouldn't be a mixed signal at all?
- Absolutely not.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.906
I'll take you back to the loony bin
where you belong.

11:36.988 --> 11:39.741
Except I'm sure
I've met you somewhere before.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.717
- It's weird.
- What?

11:49.792 --> 11:51.294
There's so many people missing.

11:51.377 --> 11:54.005
Uncle Steven, Auntie Lynn,
all the Baxters.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.137
Where are they?

11:56.216 --> 11:57.968
You don't think
something's gone wrong?

11:58.051 --> 12:01.180
Maybe it's a godsend,
gives you time to think.

12:01.346 --> 12:04.065
You don't have to go through with it,
not these days.

12:04.140 --> 12:06.108
- Live in sin for a bit.
- Dad.

12:06.184 --> 12:10.860
In 10 years' time, you'll turn round and
say, "If only I could turn the clock back."

12:16.110 --> 12:18.329
Is it me or did it just get cold?

12:57.735 --> 12:58.861
Rose.

13:02.073 --> 13:05.418
I met this bloke at the horses
and he's cutting me in on copyright.

13:05.493 --> 13:07.712
But I thought you were
a proper businessman.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.916
I wish. I do a bit of this, bit of that.
I scrape by.

13:11.457 --> 13:14.336
Right. I must've heard wrong.

13:14.419 --> 13:17.514
So, really,
you're a bit of a Del Boy.

13:17.588 --> 13:19.135
Shoot me down in flames.

13:19.215 --> 13:22.344
You're not related to my wife
by any chance, are you?

13:23.177 --> 13:25.396
Oh, my God.
She's gonna be at the wedding.

13:25.471 --> 13:27.599
Jackie? Do you know her?

13:29.559 --> 13:30.731
Sort of.

13:31.227 --> 13:33.025
What's she told you about me, then?

13:33.104 --> 13:36.483
She said she'd picked
the most fantastic man in the world.

13:37.692 --> 13:40.912
Must be a different Jackie, then.
She'd never say that.

13:43.698 --> 13:45.917
This stuff goes
right over my head.

13:46.701 --> 13:49.170
- That's not out yet.
- Good job and all.

13:49.245 --> 13:53.341
- I'm just gonna check my messages.
- How do you mean? Messages?

13:55.001 --> 13:56.969
- Is that a phone?
- Yeah.

13:59.505 --> 14:02.304
Watson, come here.
I need you.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.599
Watson, come here. I need you.

14:06.763 --> 14:09.312
Watson, come here. I need you.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.949
Half the guests haven't turned up.

14:26.032 --> 14:29.707
You're better off not being here,
it's a disaster in the making.

14:30.620 --> 14:34.545
No, in this case,
"knocked her up" is a phrase I'd use.

14:34.624 --> 14:36.843
Watson, come here. I need you.

14:36.918 --> 14:38.636
Hello? Who's this?

14:38.711 --> 14:40.554
Watson, come here. I...

14:42.632 --> 14:45.761
Dad, get inside.
We can't see the bride before the wedding.

14:45.843 --> 14:47.937
- That's bad luck.
- Bad luck when you met her.

14:48.012 --> 14:50.185
I tell you, this day is cursed.

15:01.776 --> 15:04.074
Now that's what I call a meringue.

15:04.153 --> 15:07.532
Stuart's dad said go round the block
'cause there's people missing.

15:07.615 --> 15:08.787
How do you mean, missing?

15:08.866 --> 15:11.494
There's no Dave, no Sunita, no Bee...

15:11.577 --> 15:13.329
There's no one from The Lamb and Flag.

15:13.413 --> 15:16.713
My train's detached again.
I knew I should have used Velcro.

15:16.791 --> 15:18.634
I'm here, stop your bellyaching.

15:18.709 --> 15:20.302
Take Rose a sec, will you?

15:20.378 --> 15:21.504
Ain't she pretty?

15:21.587 --> 15:23.510
She's a little madam,
that's what she is.

15:23.589 --> 15:24.886
I need more hands.

15:24.966 --> 15:27.936
Where's her useless article
of a dad got to?

15:36.686 --> 15:37.778
Dad!

15:40.690 --> 15:43.159
It's that car.
Same one as before.

15:46.737 --> 15:49.456
It was right in front of us,
where's he gone?

15:51.993 --> 15:54.166
You called me "Dad"?
What did you say that for?

15:54.245 --> 15:58.091
Oh, wonderful! Here he is,
the accident waiting to happen.

15:58.166 --> 16:00.840
You'd be late for your own funeral
and it nearly was.

16:00.918 --> 16:03.341
- No damage done.
- And who's this?

16:04.338 --> 16:06.682
What are you looking at
with your mouth open?

16:06.757 --> 16:08.725
- Your hair.
- What?

16:08.801 --> 16:10.678
I've never seen it like...

16:12.013 --> 16:13.981
I mean...

16:14.056 --> 16:16.775
it's lovely, your hair's lovely.

16:20.938 --> 16:22.940
And that baby you're holding.

16:24.609 --> 16:27.453
That would be your baby.

16:27.653 --> 16:30.497
- Another one of yours, is she?
- She saved my life.

16:30.573 --> 16:33.076
That's a new one.
What was it last time?

16:33.159 --> 16:35.753
I didn't even know her.
She was a cloakroom attendant.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.626
I was helping her
look for my ticket.

16:37.705 --> 16:41.335
There were three duff le coats all the same.
Somehow the rack collapsed.

16:41.417 --> 16:43.169
We were under all this stuff.

16:43.252 --> 16:44.424
Were you playing around?

16:44.504 --> 16:46.757
What's it got to do with you
what he gets up to?

16:46.839 --> 16:48.682
- What does he get up to?
- You'd know.

16:48.758 --> 16:52.308
Because I'm that stupid. I play around
and I bring her to meet the missus.

16:52.386 --> 16:54.059
- You silly...
- But you are that stupid.

16:54.138 --> 16:56.607
Can we keep this stuff for back home,
just for now?

16:56.682 --> 16:58.275
What, with the rest of the rubbish?

16:58.351 --> 17:01.855
You bring home cut-price detergents,
tonic water,

17:01.938 --> 17:04.316
Betamax tapes and none of it works.

17:04.397 --> 17:06.867
I'm drowning in your rubbish.

17:06.943 --> 17:10.242
What did he tell you?
Did he say he's this big businessman?

17:10.320 --> 17:14.701
'Cause he's not. He's a failure.
Born failure, that one.

17:14.784 --> 17:16.330
Rose needs a proper father...

17:16.410 --> 17:19.209
Jackie, I'm making a living.
It keeps us fed, doesn't it?

17:19.288 --> 17:20.631
Stop it.

17:22.333 --> 17:25.051
You're not like this.
You love each other.

17:25.127 --> 17:27.095
Pete, you never used to
like them mental.

17:27.171 --> 17:29.845
- Or I don't know, maybe you did.
- Jackie, wait, listen...

17:29.924 --> 17:33.428
If you're not careful, there'll be a
wedding and a divorce on the same day.

17:34.679 --> 17:37.307
Wait here. Give us a couple
of minutes with the missus.

17:37.390 --> 17:40.769
Tell you what, straighten the car up.
Stick it round the corner.

17:40.851 --> 17:42.819
Don't cause any more trouble.

18:04.208 --> 18:05.676
Hey, Jack.

18:35.323 --> 18:38.497
I'm not listening.
It's the dufﬂe coats all over again.

18:38.576 --> 18:41.750
Jackie, sometimes a dufﬂe coat
is just a dufﬂe coat.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.590
Things will get better soon.
I promise.

18:44.665 --> 18:46.633
I've had enough of
all your daft schemes.

18:46.709 --> 18:48.837
I never know where
the next meal's coming from.

18:48.919 --> 18:52.469
I'll get it right, love. One day soon,
I promise you I'll get it right.

18:52.548 --> 18:53.845
Come on.

18:57.511 --> 19:00.139
Monsters! Going to eat us!

19:00.222 --> 19:03.066
What sort of monsters, sweetheart?
Is it aliens?

19:08.272 --> 19:09.444
Rose!

19:14.153 --> 19:15.905
Get in the church!

19:27.500 --> 19:28.922
Get in the church!

19:34.090 --> 19:37.094
Oh, my God. What are they?

19:37.176 --> 19:38.769
Inside!

19:40.596 --> 19:42.473
- Sarah!
- Stay in there!

19:59.156 --> 20:00.373
In.

20:17.675 --> 20:20.474
They can't get in.
Old windows and doors. Okay.

20:20.678 --> 20:23.522
The older something is,
the stronger it is.

20:23.597 --> 20:24.974
What else?

20:28.185 --> 20:30.233
Go and check the other doors.
Move!

20:30.312 --> 20:33.065
What's happening?
What are they? What are they?

20:33.149 --> 20:35.493
There's been an accident in time.
A wound in time.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.445
They're like bacteria,
taking advantage.

20:37.528 --> 20:40.281
What do you mean? Time?
What are you jabbering on about time?

20:40.364 --> 20:41.536
I might've known you'd argue.

20:41.615 --> 20:44.494
- Jackie, I'm sick of you complaining.
- How do you know my name?

20:44.577 --> 20:45.829
I've never met you in my life.

20:45.911 --> 20:47.754
You never will
unless I sort this out.

20:47.830 --> 20:50.174
If you don't mind,
I've waited a long time to say this,

20:50.249 --> 20:54.846
Jackie Tyler, do as I say.
Go and check the doors.

20:55.296 --> 20:56.548
Yes, sir.

20:56.630 --> 20:57.882
I should've done that ages ago.

20:57.965 --> 21:00.138
- My dad was out there.
- You can mourn him later.

21:00.217 --> 21:02.686
Now we've got to concentrate
on keeping ourselves alive.

21:02.762 --> 21:05.140
- My dad had...
- There is nothing I can do for him.

21:05.222 --> 21:07.600
No, but he had this phone thing.

21:07.683 --> 21:10.983
I can't get it to work.
I keep getting this voice.

21:11.187 --> 21:14.066
Watson, come here. I need you.

21:14.148 --> 21:15.900
That's the very first phone call.

21:15.983 --> 21:17.530
Alexander Graham Bell.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.829
I don't think the telephone's
gonna be much use.

21:19.904 --> 21:21.326
Someone must have
called the police.

21:21.405 --> 21:23.999
The police can't help you now,
no one can.

21:24.241 --> 21:26.835
Nothing in this universe
can harm those things.

21:26.911 --> 21:30.336
Time's been damaged
and they've come to sterilise the wound.

21:34.919 --> 21:37.013
By consuming everything inside.

21:38.464 --> 21:39.966
Is this because...

21:42.384 --> 21:43.806
Is this my fault?

21:59.026 --> 22:00.494
No!

22:15.918 --> 22:19.013
There's smoke coming up from the city.
But no sirens.

22:19.213 --> 22:22.843
I don't think it's just us. I think
these things are all over the place.

22:22.925 --> 22:24.302
Maybe the whole world.

22:32.560 --> 22:34.483
Was that a car?

22:36.897 --> 22:39.491
It's not important.
Don't worry about it.

23:05.467 --> 23:09.563
This mate of yours.
What did he mean, this is your fault?

23:11.599 --> 23:13.772
Don't know. just everything.

23:15.019 --> 23:16.862
I gave you my car keys.

23:20.524 --> 23:23.403
You don't give your keys
to a complete stranger.

23:26.322 --> 23:28.541
It's like I trusted you.

23:29.825 --> 23:32.624
The moment I met you,
I just did.

23:35.164 --> 23:37.132
A wound in time.

23:39.835 --> 23:41.303
You called me Dad.

23:42.630 --> 23:43.927
I can see it.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.677
In my eyes.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.307
Jackie's attitude.

23:49.970 --> 23:52.189
You sound like her
when you shout.

24:02.024 --> 24:05.574
You are.
You are. You're my Rose.

24:05.736 --> 24:07.534
You're my Rose, grown up.

24:08.906 --> 24:13.628
Dad! My dad. My daddy.

24:17.748 --> 24:18.840
Excuse me.

24:18.916 --> 24:20.759
- Mister...?
- Doctor.

24:20.834 --> 24:23.963
- You seem to know what's going on.
- I give that impression, yeah.

24:24.046 --> 24:26.640
- I just wanted to ask...
- Can you save us?

24:34.098 --> 24:35.566
Who are you two, then?

24:35.641 --> 24:37.735
- Stuart Hoskins.
- Sarah Clark.

24:38.060 --> 24:40.154
And one extra? Boy or girl?

24:40.980 --> 24:43.824
I don't know.
I don't want to know, really.

24:43.899 --> 24:45.867
How did all this get started?

24:46.777 --> 24:49.121
Outside the Beatbox Club,
2:00 in the morning.

24:49.196 --> 24:53.076
Street corner, I'd lost my purse,
didn't have money for a taxi.

24:54.034 --> 24:56.128
- I took her home.
- Then what?

24:56.912 --> 24:58.505
Asked her for a date?

24:58.789 --> 25:02.293
- Wrote his number on my hand.
- Never got rid of her since.

25:02.376 --> 25:04.049
My dad said...

25:09.216 --> 25:13.266
I don't know what this is all about
and I know we're not important...

25:13.345 --> 25:15.393
Who said you're not important?

25:17.016 --> 25:21.362
I've travelled to all sorts of places,
done things you couldn't even imagine.

25:22.021 --> 25:23.238
But you two.

25:24.732 --> 25:29.363
Street corner, 2:00 in the morning,
getting a taxi home.

25:31.321 --> 25:33.449
I've never had a life like that.

25:34.324 --> 25:35.997
Yes.

25:36.076 --> 25:37.749
I'll try and save you.

25:42.416 --> 25:44.464
I'm a dad.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.011
I mean, I'm already a dad

25:46.086 --> 25:49.841
but Rose grows up and she's you.

25:50.966 --> 25:52.263
That's wonderful.

25:52.342 --> 25:55.221
I mean, I suppose I thought
that you'd be a bit useless

25:55.304 --> 25:57.932
what with my useless genes
and all but...

25:59.224 --> 26:01.522
Well, I mean, how did you get here?

26:01.602 --> 26:03.821
- Do you really want to know?
- Yeah.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.569
A time machine.

26:07.441 --> 26:09.489
- Time machine?
- Cross my heart.

26:09.568 --> 26:12.196
Do you all have time machines
where you come from?

26:12.279 --> 26:13.906
No, just the Doctor.

26:14.823 --> 26:17.246
Did you know these
things were coming?

26:17.868 --> 26:18.994
No.

26:19.870 --> 26:22.373
God, I don't know,
my head's spinning.

26:25.167 --> 26:26.885
What's the future like?

26:28.587 --> 26:30.339
It's not so different.

26:30.464 --> 26:32.762
What am I like?
Have I gone grey?

26:37.596 --> 26:40.770
Have I gone bald?
Don't tell me I've gone bald.

26:46.480 --> 26:50.075
So, if this mate of yours isn't your
boyfriend, and I have to say I'm glad

26:50.150 --> 26:53.700
'cause being your dad and all,
I think he's a bit old for you.

26:54.029 --> 26:56.452
- Have you got a bloke?
- No. I did have.

26:56.532 --> 26:58.159
Mickey.

27:02.204 --> 27:04.252
Do you know him?

27:04.331 --> 27:08.211
I just didn't recognise him in a suit.
You have to let go of me, sweetheart.

27:08.293 --> 27:09.590
I'm always saying that.

27:09.670 --> 27:12.844
He just grabs hold of what's passing
and holds on for dear life.

27:12.923 --> 27:15.551
God help his poor girlfriend
if he ever gets one.

27:15.634 --> 27:18.604
- Me and Rose were just talking.
- Oh, yeah? Talking?

27:18.679 --> 27:21.023
While the world comes to an end,
what do you do?

27:21.098 --> 27:23.100
Cling to the youngest blonde.

27:25.060 --> 27:26.403
Come on, Mick.

27:29.898 --> 27:31.992
- You can't tell her.
- Why?

27:32.109 --> 27:34.453
I mean,
I really don't want you to tell her.

27:34.528 --> 27:36.951
- You don't want people to know?
- Where I come from,

27:37.030 --> 27:39.909
Jackie doesn't know how
to work the timer on the video recorder.

27:39.992 --> 27:41.869
I showed her that last week.

27:42.202 --> 27:43.328
Point taken.

27:48.375 --> 27:52.801
Rose, you're not going to bring about
the end of the world, are you?

27:53.672 --> 27:54.889
Are you?

28:00.470 --> 28:02.814
Jackie gave her to me to look after.

28:03.473 --> 28:04.975
How times change.

28:05.726 --> 28:07.023
I'd better be careful.

28:07.102 --> 28:10.823
I think I just imprinted myself on Mickey
like a mother chicken.

28:11.231 --> 28:14.781
No. Don't touch the baby.

28:17.946 --> 28:20.199
You're both the same person,
that's a paradox.

28:20.282 --> 28:23.502
We don't want a paradox happening,
not with these things outside.

28:23.577 --> 28:27.377
Anything new, any disturbance in time,
makes them stronger.

28:27.831 --> 28:29.754
A paradox might let them in.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.552
I can't do anything right, can I?

28:32.628 --> 28:37.600
Since you asked, no.
So, don't touch the baby.

28:37.883 --> 28:40.887
- I'm not stupid.
- You could have fooled me.

28:44.806 --> 28:46.479
All right...

28:47.517 --> 28:48.769
I'm sorry.

28:51.772 --> 28:53.774
I wasn't really gonna leave you
on your own.

28:53.857 --> 28:54.949
I kn ow.

28:55.067 --> 28:58.788
Between you and me,
I haven't got a plan. No idea.

29:00.572 --> 29:02.495
No way out.

29:02.616 --> 29:04.960
You'll think of something.

29:05.077 --> 29:06.954
The entire Earth's been sterilised.

29:07.037 --> 29:10.917
This, and other places like it,
are all that's left of the human race.

29:10.999 --> 29:14.344
We might hold out for a while,
but nothing can stop those creatures.

29:14.419 --> 29:17.923
They'll get through in the end.
The walls aren't that old.

29:18.423 --> 29:20.551
And there's nothing I can do to stop them.

29:20.634 --> 29:23.729
There used to be laws stopping
this kind of thing from happening.

29:23.804 --> 29:26.023
My people would have stopped this.

29:27.224 --> 29:28.851
But they're all gone.

29:30.102 --> 29:32.355
And now I'm going the same way.

29:32.437 --> 29:34.155
If I'd realised...

29:37.276 --> 29:38.903
Just...

29:40.570 --> 29:42.322
tell me you're sorry.

29:44.199 --> 29:45.416
I am.

29:46.118 --> 29:47.370
I'm sorry.

30:01.133 --> 30:03.477
Have you got something hot?

30:06.555 --> 30:08.102
It's the Tardis key.

30:16.481 --> 30:19.325
It's telling me
it's still connected to the Tardis.

30:19.401 --> 30:22.075
The inside of my ship
was thrown out of the wound

30:22.154 --> 30:23.952
but we can use
this to bring it back.

30:24.031 --> 30:26.875
And once I've got my ship back,
then I can mend everything.

30:26.950 --> 30:30.329
Now, I just need a bit of power.
Has anybody got a battery?

30:30.954 --> 30:32.547
This one big enough?

30:33.874 --> 30:34.966
Fantastic.

30:35.042 --> 30:37.090
Good old Dad. There you go.

30:38.503 --> 30:41.302
Just need to do
a bit of charging up.

30:41.423 --> 30:43.721
And then we can
bring everyone back.

31:08.950 --> 31:12.750
You, erm, you never said why
you came here in the first place.

31:12.871 --> 31:17.502
If I had a time machine, I wouldn't have
thought 1987 was anything special.

31:17.584 --> 31:18.927
Not round here, anyway.

31:19.002 --> 31:22.506
- We just ended up here.
- Lucky for me, eh?

31:22.589 --> 31:25.934
- If you hadn't been there to save me...
- That was just a coincidence.

31:26.009 --> 31:29.889
That was just really good luck.
It's amazing.

31:33.850 --> 31:37.855
So, in the future,
are me and her indoors still together?

31:39.106 --> 31:40.153
Yeah.

31:41.691 --> 31:44.160
- You still living with us?
- Yep.

31:48.698 --> 31:50.575
Am I a good dad?

31:54.329 --> 31:55.797
You...

31:58.458 --> 32:03.180
You told me a bedtime story
every night when I was small.

32:03.255 --> 32:06.304
You were always there,
you never missed one.

32:11.012 --> 32:13.140
And, erm...

32:14.683 --> 32:18.278
you took us for picnics
in the country every Saturday.

32:20.230 --> 32:21.903
You never let us down.

32:23.608 --> 32:25.952
You were there for us all the time.

32:27.028 --> 32:29.497
Someone I could really rely on.

32:36.621 --> 32:38.123
That's not me.

33:00.145 --> 33:03.649
Right, no one touches that key,
have you got that? Don't touch it.

33:03.732 --> 33:07.111
Anyone touches that key,
it'll be, well, zap!

33:07.319 --> 33:11.165
Just leave it be and everything will be fine.
We'll get out. All of us.

33:11.239 --> 33:14.789
Stuart, Sarah, you're gonna get married,
just like I said.

33:43.021 --> 33:46.400
- When time gets sorted out...
- Everybody here forgets what happened.

33:46.483 --> 33:50.659
And don't worry, the thing
that you changed will stay changed.

33:50.862 --> 33:52.864
You mean I'll still be alive.

33:54.908 --> 33:56.910
Though I'm meant to be dead.

34:01.206 --> 34:03.550
That's why I haven't done anything
with my life.

34:03.625 --> 34:05.093
Why it didn't mean anything.

34:05.168 --> 34:07.762
- Doesn't work like that.
- Rubbish.

34:07.879 --> 34:10.598
I was so useless
I couldn't even die properly.

34:11.675 --> 34:13.803
Now it's my fault
all this has happened.

34:13.885 --> 34:16.728
- This is my fault.
- No, love.

34:16.804 --> 34:18.398
I'm your dad.

34:18.473 --> 34:20.771
It's my job for it to be my fault.

34:20.891 --> 34:24.567
Her clad?
How are you her dad?

34:26.106 --> 34:27.824
How old were you? 12?

34:27.899 --> 34:31.199
- Oh, that's disgusting.
- Jacks, listen.

34:32.737 --> 34:35.581
- This is Rose.
- Rose?

34:35.699 --> 34:37.246
How sick is that?

34:37.324 --> 34:39.373
Did you give my daughter
a second-hand name?

34:39.452 --> 34:42.205
How many are there?
Do you call them all Rose?

34:42.289 --> 34:44.963
Oh, for God's sake, look.
It's the same Rose.

34:46.083 --> 34:47.427
Rose, no!

34:52.424 --> 34:54.301
Everyone, behind me!

35:08.148 --> 35:10.116
I'm the oldest thing in here.

35:13.361 --> 35:14.408
Doctor!

35:39.638 --> 35:41.140
It's cold.

35:42.807 --> 35:44.605
The key's cold.

35:48.563 --> 35:50.440
Oh, my God, he's dead.

35:55.362 --> 35:57.990
This is all my fault.

35:58.073 --> 36:01.373
Both of you, all of you.

36:02.118 --> 36:03.665
The whole world.

36:13.213 --> 36:17.184
This is it. There's nothing we can do.
It's the end.

37:27.162 --> 37:29.415
The Doctor really cared about you.

37:30.582 --> 37:34.712
He didn't want you to go through it again.
Not if there was another way.

37:35.670 --> 37:37.217
Now there isn't.

37:41.176 --> 37:42.803
What are you talking about?

37:42.886 --> 37:45.435
The car that should
have killed me, love.

37:46.264 --> 37:48.312
It's here.

37:52.270 --> 37:54.898
The Doctor worked it out way back but he...

37:56.149 --> 37:57.867
tried to protect me.

38:01.112 --> 38:02.910
Still.

38:02.989 --> 38:04.912
He's not in charge anymore.

38:05.784 --> 38:07.536
I am.

38:08.411 --> 38:11.210
- But you can't.
- Who am I, love?

38:13.583 --> 38:14.800
My daddy.

38:18.463 --> 38:20.841
Jackie, look at her.

38:22.300 --> 38:23.768
She's ours.

38:32.268 --> 38:33.440
Of course.

38:40.193 --> 38:42.446
I'm meant to be dead, Jackie.

38:43.988 --> 38:45.865
You're gonna get rid of me at last.

38:45.949 --> 38:47.451
Don't say that.

38:47.534 --> 38:50.663
For once in your life, trust me.
It's got to be done.

38:50.995 --> 38:54.841
You've got to survive
'cause you've got to bring up our daughter.

39:09.430 --> 39:13.606
I never read you those bedtime stories,
I never took you on those picnics.

39:14.185 --> 39:16.153
I was never there for you.

39:16.771 --> 39:18.239
You would've been.

39:18.565 --> 39:20.442
But I can do this for you.

39:21.526 --> 39:23.699
I can be a proper dad to you now.

39:24.362 --> 39:25.705
But it's not fair.

39:25.780 --> 39:27.908
I've had all these extra hours.

39:28.616 --> 39:30.914
No one else in the world
has ever had that.

39:30.994 --> 39:34.294
And on top of that,
I get to see you.

39:37.792 --> 39:39.715
And you're beautiful.

39:42.630 --> 39:44.348
How lucky am I, eh?

39:45.300 --> 39:48.349
So, come on.
Do as your dad says.

39:57.645 --> 39:59.272
You gonna be there for me, love?

40:03.985 --> 40:06.113
Thanks for saving me.

40:39.062 --> 40:40.405
Goodbye, love.

40:58.748 --> 41:00.967
Go to him. Quick.

41:53.928 --> 41:56.056
The driver was just a kid.

41:57.098 --> 42:00.352
He stopped,
he waited for the police.

42:00.476 --> 42:02.194
It wasn't his fault.

42:03.271 --> 42:05.569
For some reason,
Pete just ran out.

42:08.484 --> 42:10.578
People say there was this girl.

42:11.571 --> 42:14.120
And she sat with Pete
while he was dying.

42:14.198 --> 42:15.825
She held his hand.

42:18.119 --> 42:19.712
Then she was gone.

42:21.539 --> 42:23.633
Never found out who she was.

42:51.527 --> 42:54.371
Peter Alan Tyler, my dad.

42:54.447 --> 42:56.745
The most wonderful man in the world.

42:57.575 --> 43:01.079
Died 7th November, 1987.

43:18.346 --> 43:19.438
And why are we chasing it?

43:19.514 --> 43:23.644
It's mauve and dangerous, and about
30 seconds from the centre of London.

43:26.229 --> 43:27.321
Rose!

43:27.396 --> 43:29.398
Please let me in, Mummy.

43:29.482 --> 43:31.109
You mustn't let him touch you.

43:31.192 --> 43:33.866
- Are you a doctor?
- I have my moments.

43:33.945 --> 43:35.071
They've all got the same injuries.

43:35.154 --> 43:37.373
Right down to the scar
on the back of the hand.

43:37.448 --> 43:41.248
Physical injuries as plague.

43:41.994 --> 43:43.337
- Hello.
- Hello.

43:43.454 --> 43:45.832
Shall we have
a drink on the balcony?

43:48.835 --> 43:52.135
- I like to think of myself as a criminal.
- I bet you do.
