<i>Live, from CIA headquarters
in beautiful Langley, Virginia,</i>

00:37.185 --> 00:40.034
<i>it's the first-ever CIA Telethon,</i>

00:40.287 --> 00:43.967
<i>with your host, Agent Stan Smith!</i>

00:44.182 --> 00:47.364
Thank you! Good evening, everybody!
How about a hand for our band,

00:47.489 --> 00:50.799
Midget Assassin and
the This Doesn't Concern You Orchestra!

00:52.731 --> 00:54.470
Man, that is some sport coat!

00:54.853 --> 00:56.725
- You like it?
- No, it's great!

00:56.850 --> 01:00.357
I just didn't realize your latest
assignment was to kill fashion!

01:01.847 --> 01:04.275
Folks, it's an honor for me
to be working in this studio.

01:04.400 --> 01:07.760
This is the very soundstage
where we faked the moon landing.

01:08.485 --> 01:10.229
And the JFK assassination.

01:11.426 --> 01:14.072
No. I'm sorry. This is where we
planned the JFK assassination.

01:18.628 --> 01:21.184
So a lot of people think
that CIA stands for

01:21.309 --> 01:22.807
"Central Intelligence Agency."

01:22.932 --> 01:24.010
Not true, folks.

01:24.135 --> 01:26.251
Fact is, CIA actually stands for

01:26.426 --> 01:30.082
"Stan Smith was born with both
male and female genitalia."

01:32.590 --> 01:34.909
That's not what we wrote.
We don't go blue.

01:35.034 --> 01:36.984
That's the lazy man's comedy.

01:37.218 --> 01:38.218
Balls.

01:40.460 --> 01:41.851
Maybe we're working too hard.

01:42.602 --> 01:45.112
Anyway, you're in for quite a show
over the next 12 hours,

01:45.237 --> 01:46.856
so give generously.

01:47.126 --> 01:50.478
Let's kick things off with our very own
Langley Falls anchor partners,

01:50.603 --> 01:52.886
Greg and Terry, reenacting
the volleyball scene

01:53.011 --> 01:55.239
from their favorite movie, <i>Top Gun</i>.

02:21.020 --> 02:23.612
Francine, you must be so proud
of your husband.

02:23.737 --> 02:26.197
This whole telethon was his idea.

02:26.856 --> 02:30.163
I know! I'm sure it's
going to be a huge success!

02:30.288 --> 02:32.536
"Godlike"?
I don't know if I'd go that far.

02:32.661 --> 02:34.661
Now, I need a moment
with my writers.

02:36.529 --> 02:38.239
What the hell was that genital joke?

02:38.409 --> 02:40.733
That's not what we wrote.
You were supposed to say,

02:40.858 --> 02:44.121
"CIA stands for
Central Insanity Agency.'"

02:44.995 --> 02:48.083
That's good. But that's not what
was on the teleprompter.

02:48.251 --> 02:49.821
Someone must have messed with it.

02:49.946 --> 02:52.379
I'm gonna go double-check the copy
for the "Taliban, Taliban,

02:52.504 --> 02:53.816
Tali-me Bana" sketch.

02:53.941 --> 02:56.123
You really think someone messed
with the teleprompter?

02:56.248 --> 02:58.493
I mean, who would want
to sabotage the telethon?

02:58.618 --> 02:59.618
Sabotage?

03:05.671 --> 03:07.856
Did you hear?
We just captured a new terrorist!

03:07.981 --> 03:09.573
Time to torture!

03:10.457 --> 03:12.910
- I get to strap him to the waterboard!
- I call the car battery!

03:13.035 --> 03:16.487
I want to slather him in oil
and make love to him all night long!

03:17.275 --> 03:19.865
Oh, no. I'm on the phone.
Yeah, I'm still here, Mom.

03:20.097 --> 03:22.629
Stop! We can't torture anyone.

03:22.754 --> 03:24.954
- What's he talking about?
- We can't afford it.

03:25.122 --> 03:26.451
I was just on Capitol Hill.

03:26.576 --> 03:29.332
The Democrats have completely
cut our torture budget.

03:30.205 --> 03:33.337
They're using the money
to teach inner-city kids

03:34.008 --> 03:35.396
to read!

03:35.799 --> 03:37.312
What are they doing?!

03:39.493 --> 03:41.800
We'll just have
to raise a million dollars

03:41.925 --> 03:43.794
and fund the torture
program ourselves.

03:43.919 --> 03:45.724
Luckily, I have plan.

03:46.105 --> 03:49.328
We have the biggest keg party
this town's ever seen.

03:49.453 --> 03:51.213
We charge five... no...

03:51.411 --> 03:52.861
seven dollars a cup.

03:52.986 --> 03:54.024
Girls drink free.

03:54.719 --> 03:56.361
I don't think that's going to work.

03:56.486 --> 03:59.759
I don't hear you suggesting
how to get girls to our party.

04:02.703 --> 04:05.263
How hard can it be to come up
with a million dollars?

04:05.388 --> 04:07.204
What if I invent something?

04:08.047 --> 04:10.333
Paper clips... paper clips...

04:10.504 --> 04:11.877
piper claps...

04:12.002 --> 04:14.692
popper clops!
Clops that pop your clappers!

04:14.817 --> 04:17.119
I think torture is
barbaric and inhumane.

04:17.244 --> 04:19.271
I can't believe
you're trying to save it.

04:19.396 --> 04:21.550
Why not? You tried
to save <i>Veronica Mars</i>.

04:21.675 --> 04:25.076
We get it. Girl detectives are bitchier
than regular detectives.

04:25.201 --> 04:26.574
Fart! Not into it.

04:26.892 --> 04:28.475
You know what show I tried to save?

04:28.600 --> 04:31.311
- The <i>Ghost Whisperer</i>.
- It's still on.

04:31.436 --> 04:32.440
Really?

04:32.786 --> 04:35.658
That's it! I've got the idea!
Dark bulbs!

04:35.783 --> 04:37.932
You know,
for when it's too bright out.

04:40.494 --> 04:42.044
What?
It's a great idea!

04:42.169 --> 04:43.615
Stan, it's okay.

04:43.740 --> 04:45.617
So you're not an idea guy.

04:45.862 --> 04:48.454
Yes, I am. Remember when
I invented that machine?

04:48.670 --> 04:51.707
Stan, that wasn't a machine.
That was a hat.

04:51.991 --> 04:54.832
I am an idea man, and
I'll prove it to you all.

04:54.957 --> 04:56.909
I just need to get away
from all this negativity

04:57.034 --> 04:58.255
so I can concentrate!

04:59.341 --> 05:01.259
Sweet and High...

05:02.024 --> 05:03.508
Wheat Thicks...

05:04.271 --> 05:07.239
- Southern Discomfort.
- Good. You're here.

05:07.364 --> 05:10.366
- You can either take your socks off now
- or I can knock 'em off for you.

05:10.491 --> 05:12.133
What are you talking about?

05:12.258 --> 05:14.067
Live, from CIA Headquarters

05:14.192 --> 05:15.629
in Langley, Virginia,

05:15.754 --> 05:19.483
it's the first annual CIA Telethon!

05:22.180 --> 05:23.180
A telethon?

05:23.616 --> 05:25.428
No one wants to run 26 miles.

05:25.553 --> 05:27.672
Not a marathon.
A telethon.

05:27.797 --> 05:30.354
It's the perfect way for you
to raise the money you need.

05:30.479 --> 05:32.415
That's the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

05:32.540 --> 05:35.472
That's what Jerry Lewis said
right before he stole my idea.

05:35.597 --> 05:36.919
You knew Jerry Lewis?

05:37.092 --> 05:39.839
Back in the '50s, I was his tailor.
I shortened his pants.

05:39.964 --> 05:42.271
Made him a star.
One day, I said to him, "Jer..."

05:42.396 --> 05:44.018
I called him Jer,
but not to his face.

05:44.143 --> 05:48.031
I said, "Jerry, how about you do
a long, televised plea for money?"

05:48.156 --> 05:50.823
Of course he did it, and he said
it was all his idea.

05:50.948 --> 05:52.819
Made me look like a total liar.

05:52.944 --> 05:55.065
The only one who believed me
was Dean Martin.

05:55.190 --> 05:57.741
Good old Dino.
What a sweetheart.

05:57.866 --> 06:00.985
Talented, talented greaseball.
From Ohio.

06:01.219 --> 06:03.848
Thanks, Roger, but I don't need
your stupid telethon idea.

06:03.973 --> 06:06.073
I have all night to come up
with something.

06:06.609 --> 06:09.379
Hamburger... Hinderer.

06:12.961 --> 06:16.041
Guess what, everybody!
Bullock loved my telethon idea.

06:16.330 --> 06:18.201
- What?
- A telethon?

06:18.397 --> 06:20.386
- That is a good idea!
- Way to go, Dad!

06:20.511 --> 06:21.379
<i>Wunderbar</i>!

06:21.573 --> 06:23.173
Wait a minute. Your idea?

06:23.341 --> 06:25.860
You should have seen it. They were
taking away all our torture stuff.

06:25.985 --> 06:30.148
Everybody's freaking out. And then,
like a bolt of lightning, it came to me.

06:30.665 --> 06:31.682
Telethon!

06:31.850 --> 06:33.680
I'm so proud of you, honey!

06:33.805 --> 06:35.770
How did you ever
think of a telethon?

06:35.895 --> 06:37.733
He didn't!
It was my idea!

06:37.858 --> 06:39.981
- Yours?
- Yeah. Remember, Stan?

06:40.106 --> 06:42.067
We were in the living room,
and I said "telethon."

06:42.236 --> 06:43.736
Stan, is that true?

06:44.912 --> 06:46.846
- I remember now.
- Thank you.

06:46.971 --> 06:49.693
You said "marathon," and that's what
got me to "telethon."

06:49.818 --> 06:52.850
- Oh, marathon!
- That's why Roger got confused!

06:52.975 --> 06:54.787
A marathon is a terrible idea.

06:55.692 --> 06:57.708
The telethon was my idea!

06:58.015 --> 07:00.544
Tell them the truth
or they're going to think I'm a liar.

07:00.712 --> 07:03.041
That spaceship sailed
a long time ago.

07:04.793 --> 07:07.901
- Get it? Because he's an alien!
- Or so he claims!

07:09.958 --> 07:12.793
He's simply not credible,
and I am, apparently!

07:13.225 --> 07:14.905
I let Jerry Lewis live.

07:15.030 --> 07:17.255
I think we all agree
that was a mistake,

07:17.380 --> 07:19.688
but I'm not going
to be branded a liar again.

07:19.856 --> 07:21.082
Mark my words.

07:21.207 --> 07:22.207
This time,

07:22.393 --> 07:25.017
I will be avenged!

07:27.636 --> 07:30.058
Please call me when dinner is ready!

07:32.752 --> 07:34.873
Of course. It's Roger!

07:34.998 --> 07:37.315
He's trying to ruin the telethon
because I didn't call him

07:37.440 --> 07:38.749
when dinner was ready!

07:42.831 --> 07:45.046
Klaus, did that teleprompter
mishap hurt us?

07:45.171 --> 07:48.464
The donations slowed down a little,
but things are starting to pick up.

07:48.589 --> 07:50.224
Good, we can still meet our goal.

07:50.349 --> 07:52.810
I'll just have to make sure
nothing else goes wrong.

07:53.781 --> 07:56.042
Anyway, what happened
after you slathered him in oil?

07:56.167 --> 07:57.142
Did he like it?

07:57.463 --> 08:00.457
Hey, everyone, look who just
wandered from their tree house

08:00.582 --> 08:02.128
in the Appalachian wilderness:

08:02.253 --> 08:04.891
it's the Amazing Buckle and Sherry!

08:06.948 --> 08:09.655
Honey, I've been meaning
to ask you for a...

08:09.823 --> 08:11.047
separation!

08:11.172 --> 08:13.375
Like you could survive
five minutes without me.

08:13.500 --> 08:15.871
What kind of man puts
his wife in a box and cuts her up?

08:15.996 --> 08:19.460
I'm just trying to create
a sense of wonder.

08:19.585 --> 08:22.167
You know what I wonder?
Why I didn't listen to my mother.

08:22.335 --> 08:25.042
"Don't marry a mountain man magician."
That's what she said.

08:25.167 --> 08:27.727
I joined a synagogue for you!

08:27.852 --> 08:29.399
Just do the trick!

08:29.524 --> 08:32.635
You wanna do a trick?
Here's a trick: Put a baby in me!

08:32.760 --> 08:34.679
Sherry and Buckle.

08:34.868 --> 08:36.140
It's Shari!

08:36.308 --> 08:38.241
Folks, we're having
a lot of fun tonight,

08:38.366 --> 08:40.537
but let's remember
why we're all here.

08:40.662 --> 08:42.167
This is a terrorist.

08:44.511 --> 08:47.817
They call him the Common
Garden Snake of Ramallah.

08:49.321 --> 08:51.353
It soundmuch scarier in Arabic.

08:52.001 --> 08:55.244
Snake, do you have information vital
to this nation's security?

08:55.369 --> 08:57.056
I do, Stan, yes, very much.

08:57.181 --> 08:59.550
And will you share
that information with us willingly?

08:59.675 --> 09:01.432
Willingly? No.

09:02.355 --> 09:05.444
This is why we need to fund
the CIA torture program.

09:05.728 --> 09:08.689
We have just over nine hours
to raise the $1 million

09:08.814 --> 09:12.354
or those repo men will take away
our torture equipment forever.

09:12.826 --> 09:14.511
Operators are standing by.

09:14.794 --> 09:16.850
And now... black music.

09:24.511 --> 09:26.257
I'm so proud of you, Stan.

09:26.382 --> 09:28.192
I really underestimated you.

09:28.387 --> 09:30.569
I'm a man of action, a man of ideas.

09:34.992 --> 09:37.600
"Dear Stan, admit you're the liar

09:37.725 --> 09:39.721
"or my reign of terror
will continue.

09:39.846 --> 09:42.509
"Signed,
the Phantom of the Telethon,

09:42.634 --> 09:43.591
"Roger.

09:43.716 --> 09:46.828
"P.S. When you give me credit,
refer to me as Roger.

09:47.104 --> 09:49.054
"Thanks, the Phantom... Roger.

09:49.391 --> 09:50.465
"Roger."

09:56.016 --> 09:59.152
So down the gauntlet has been laid.

10:00.093 --> 10:01.090
Lain?

10:01.511 --> 10:04.433
- Laid.
- Delivery for Phantom of the Telethon.

10:04.558 --> 10:06.518
Oh, my God, my pipe organ!

10:08.023 --> 10:11.430
This is what I'm supposed to play
maniacally down in the catacombs?

10:11.869 --> 10:14.395
What'd you think
you were getting for $39.95?

10:14.541 --> 10:16.741
No, no, this is totally unaccept...

10:21.964 --> 10:23.205
I can work with this.

10:29.789 --> 10:31.846
Welcome back to the CIA Telethon.

10:31.971 --> 10:34.343
Folks, we still have a long way to go
to reach our goal

10:34.468 --> 10:36.118
so we need your pledges.

10:36.402 --> 10:38.178
Smile and look to camera B.

10:38.648 --> 10:41.555
You know, sometimes torture
doesn't go quite the way you planned.

10:41.680 --> 10:42.808
Let's watch!

10:43.852 --> 10:45.602
{\TORTURE BLOOPERS}

11:03.177 --> 11:04.788
Cut! Cut!
I'm sorry, folks.

11:05.123 --> 11:07.959
I have no idea
how that tape got in there.

11:13.864 --> 11:14.984
Play something!

11:19.053 --> 11:21.095
What the hell was that?
Honey,

11:21.220 --> 11:24.975
that's what you have to do
after a man takes you to a fancy dinner.

11:25.357 --> 11:27.144
No, I mean, why was it shown?

11:27.365 --> 11:28.907
Well, I'll tell you why.

11:29.032 --> 11:31.528
Because Roger's still
clinging to the fantasy

11:31.653 --> 11:35.020
that this telethon was his idea,
and now he's trying to ruin it.

11:35.145 --> 11:38.101
Steve, Hayley, I need you
to find him and stop him.

11:38.226 --> 11:40.886
I better get the security guard.
I'm not searching that basement

11:41.011 --> 11:42.803
unless I'm accompanied
by an armed stranger

11:42.928 --> 11:45.307
who failed the psychological
test to become a cop.

11:51.048 --> 11:53.545
Here's the intro
for the circus bear, Mr. Smith.

11:53.928 --> 11:55.611
"Some acts are too hot.

11:55.736 --> 11:57.455
"Some acts are too cold.

11:57.580 --> 12:00.128
"This act is just... right."

12:00.797 --> 12:01.928
Like Goldilocks.

12:02.289 --> 12:05.646
Part of me thinks they will be confused
because there's only one bear.

12:05.771 --> 12:07.530
You're overthinking it!

12:08.853 --> 12:11.933
"Irene Grossbard,

12:12.058 --> 12:14.710
"Irene Grossbard

12:14.835 --> 12:16.982
"I really mean it,

12:17.107 --> 12:19.597
"Irene Grossbard...!"

12:21.100 --> 12:25.399
Okay, that was Gretchen Grossbard
with a tribute to her sister Irene...

12:26.031 --> 12:27.238
Grossbard.

12:27.760 --> 12:29.755
Folks, we gotta do better than this.

12:29.880 --> 12:32.707
You know, the CIA has captured
a lot of bomb-makers.

12:32.832 --> 12:35.863
Well, it's time for you
to set off the biggest bomb of all...

12:36.093 --> 12:37.674
the one in your hearts.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.883
Let's keep the show going.

12:41.008 --> 12:42.380
Some acts are too hot.

12:42.505 --> 12:44.188
Some acts are too cold.

12:44.313 --> 12:46.215
This act is just right.

12:49.879 --> 12:51.937
Joke-killer.
He's a joke-killer.

12:52.132 --> 12:55.065
Please welcome Boris
the Russian circus bear.

13:06.834 --> 13:08.120
Something is wrong.

13:14.236 --> 13:16.860
Itty-bitty brake line is cut.

13:19.895 --> 13:23.218
All part of the show, folks.
Everything's fine. Music, Frodo, music!

13:29.331 --> 13:30.767
Hayley, what the hell happened?

13:30.998 --> 13:33.687
We were looking for Roger when
somebody hit me on the head.

13:33.855 --> 13:35.483
When I woke up, Steve was gone.

13:35.608 --> 13:37.649
Wait. What would Roger
want with Steve?

13:39.097 --> 13:40.276
What the hell?!

13:40.446 --> 13:42.286
Do not fear me, fair m***

13:42.534 --> 13:44.587
Though my outward appearance
may repulse thee,

13:44.712 --> 13:47.346
I assure you
my intentions are most pure.

13:47.471 --> 13:50.996
- What are you doing?
- The phantom welcomes you to his home.

13:51.165 --> 13:53.383
Geez, it stinks in here.

13:53.703 --> 13:55.000
Why am I in a dress?

13:55.263 --> 13:58.081
I'll thank you to hold
your criticism, my darling.

13:58.206 --> 13:59.693
The hell with this!

13:59.818 --> 14:03.417
Steve! Steve, come back here!
I am trying to do something!

14:03.842 --> 14:07.828
Ladies and gentlemen, the U.S. may be
the greatest nation in the world,

14:08.170 --> 14:10.252
but do you know
what the second-greatest nation is?

14:10.377 --> 14:12.601
- El Salvador!
- No, not Mexico.

14:12.966 --> 14:15.896
The second-greatest nation
is donation.

14:16.126 --> 14:17.937
Won't you all become citizens?

14:18.327 --> 14:20.787
Now let's go to a real
good novelty today:

14:20.912 --> 14:24.382
Jeff Fisher and the Jeff Fisher
Hacky Sack Attack.

14:24.754 --> 14:26.780
One, two, three...

14:28.438 --> 14:30.099
Thank you, Langley!

14:33.764 --> 14:34.999
What?

14:35.567 --> 14:37.255
You want more?

14:37.691 --> 14:38.757
All right.

14:38.882 --> 14:40.702
One, two...

14:56.037 --> 14:59.349
I really thought we were gearing up
for a much more satisfying chase.

14:59.474 --> 15:00.439
But this...

15:00.659 --> 15:02.108
Roger, I'll kill you!

15:02.322 --> 15:04.405
I'm not Roger.
I'm the phantom.

15:05.976 --> 15:07.864
Well, yeah. Who did you...?
What?

15:08.069 --> 15:09.983
Anyway, you'll never stop me!

15:13.696 --> 15:16.081
There you go again,
stealing my idea.

15:16.458 --> 15:19.785
Well, until you tell the family
this telethon was my idea,

15:19.910 --> 15:21.655
I've got havoc to wreak.

15:21.938 --> 15:23.296
Wreck? Wreak.

15:23.673 --> 15:24.933
It ends now.

15:25.796 --> 15:27.804
You can't stop the phantom!

15:27.929 --> 15:30.310
These riggings and catwalks
are my domain,

15:30.435 --> 15:32.411
and I am their master.

15:52.228 --> 15:53.910
All right, all right, I give up!

15:54.177 --> 15:55.697
But it doesn't matter.

15:56.034 --> 15:58.409
I've already destroyed this telethon

15:58.725 --> 16:00.625
and untied your bow tie.

16:01.797 --> 16:04.072
You've given me a relaxed demeanor!

16:05.125 --> 16:07.089
Oh, my God, is that a bomb?!

16:07.214 --> 16:10.049
- You planted a bomb?!
- What the hell are you talking about?

16:10.174 --> 16:13.294
That's enough C-4 to blow up
this entire building.

16:13.419 --> 16:15.353
- Disarm it!
- Stan, it's not mine.

16:15.478 --> 16:17.179
All I did was change
the teleprompter,

16:17.304 --> 16:20.520
cut the brakes, released the terrorist,
dropped a fishing boat on Jeff Fisher...

16:20.688 --> 16:24.090
Wait. You released the terrorist?
He's an explosives expert!

16:24.215 --> 16:26.773
- We'll never be able to disarm it!
- Oh, my God!

16:26.898 --> 16:29.988
Stan, I know exactly what to do.
Put me down.

16:34.552 --> 16:36.802
Let's try that on the fart setting.

16:41.425 --> 16:44.669
I don't know. It's funnier, but I think
it takes out some of the tension.

16:49.368 --> 16:52.676
- How could you release The Snake?
- He's a master bomb-maker.

16:52.964 --> 16:55.566
Me? I don't know about master.

16:55.691 --> 16:56.806
I make a nice bomb.

16:56.974 --> 16:58.894
All right, Snake, the jig is up.

17:02.912 --> 17:05.315
"Prepare to meet your Mecca."

17:07.252 --> 17:09.311
Fine. Go ahead and kill me now.

17:09.436 --> 17:11.371
Once the ticking clock
on your tote board

17:11.496 --> 17:15.169
counts down to zero, this whole building
will be blown to smithereens.

17:15.465 --> 17:17.613
Good God, I've got
to evacuate the building!

17:17.738 --> 17:18.788
Not so fast.

17:18.990 --> 17:20.296
I've rigged the exits.

17:20.421 --> 17:23.165
I've also rigged the elevator shaft,
the air ducts,

17:23.290 --> 17:25.477
the little window in the bathroom.

17:26.098 --> 17:27.440
I've seen a lot of movies.

17:27.565 --> 17:29.733
When you are forbidden to drink,
dance or touch yourself,

17:29.858 --> 17:32.837
- your afternoons are pretty free.
- You can't touch yourself?

17:33.844 --> 17:35.868
I'll give you the code
to disarm the bomb,

17:35.993 --> 17:38.336
but first you'll have
to meet my demands.

17:38.461 --> 17:40.326
I don't negotiate with terrorists.

17:40.451 --> 17:43.209
Oh, really?
Have you ever bought a mattress?

17:43.919 --> 17:45.730
Fine. What are your demands?

17:45.898 --> 17:49.313
I have something I want you
to tell the world.

17:51.246 --> 17:53.196
Hello, I'm the United States.

17:53.533 --> 17:54.678
And I'm Israel.

17:54.803 --> 17:57.360
With you behind me,
I can do whatever I want.

17:57.485 --> 17:59.203
Well, I want you.

17:59.484 --> 18:00.484
Take me.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.098
No, this is wrong.

18:04.223 --> 18:06.471
We both have the same father: Satan.

18:06.777 --> 18:07.904
I don't care.

18:09.884 --> 18:11.541
Oh, God, oh, God!

18:11.666 --> 18:14.148
Oh, Judeo-Christian false God!

18:16.160 --> 18:18.701
All right, I did your little play,
and it was intoxicating.

18:18.826 --> 18:21.385
If you have anything else
I'd be right for, keep me in mind.

18:21.510 --> 18:23.880
In the meantime, I need you
to disarm the bomb.

18:24.005 --> 18:27.388
Oh, that? No, I was lying.
I was never going to disarm the bomb.

18:27.513 --> 18:30.358
- You bastard!
- You're mad at him for lying?

18:30.565 --> 18:32.767
You guys are enemies.
Of course he lies to you.

18:32.892 --> 18:33.955
But you're worse.

18:34.080 --> 18:37.282
You stole my idea and lied
about it to your own family.

18:37.611 --> 18:39.361
Oh, my God, you're right.

18:39.917 --> 18:41.167
Lying is wrong.

18:41.631 --> 18:43.439
I'd know that
if I only I'd paid attention

18:43.564 --> 18:45.415
to anything that's ever happened
to me before.

18:45.583 --> 18:48.585
It's not too late to tell
everyone the truth, Stan.

18:48.904 --> 18:51.338
What's the point?
We're about to die.

18:51.463 --> 18:54.089
I don't want "I'm a liar" to be
the last thing I say to them.

18:54.395 --> 18:57.150
It doesn't have to be the last thing.
What if I save us all?

18:57.275 --> 18:58.902
Then will you tell them the truth?

18:59.451 --> 19:02.807
You save my family, and I'd be honored
to redeem your good name.

19:04.602 --> 19:06.365
Excuse me.
Does this have dairy in it?

19:06.490 --> 19:08.497
Because if you want
to see a real dirty bomb,

19:08.622 --> 19:11.283
give me something with dairy in it.

19:13.894 --> 19:15.181
The truth must be told!

19:15.306 --> 19:18.252
- What's the code to disarm the bomb?
- I'll never tell!

19:23.666 --> 19:25.095
Hey, calm down!

19:25.220 --> 19:26.470
Leaping lizards!

19:28.838 --> 19:30.126
This is annoying!

19:33.895 --> 19:35.018
Wait a minute.

19:35.143 --> 19:38.176
I think I know how to save us
and the CIA.

19:38.494 --> 19:40.544
Ladies and gentlemen,
we've had a lot of fun tonight,

19:40.669 --> 19:43.306
but when that clock runs down,
this building will explode.

19:44.512 --> 19:46.577
Yeah, you should be concerned

19:46.750 --> 19:49.588
because that's the only man
who knows the code to disarm the bomb,

19:49.713 --> 19:50.930
and he's not talking.

19:51.055 --> 19:53.358
And he's not talking
because we can't torture him.

19:53.604 --> 19:55.859
Sure, he can be beaten by amateurs

19:55.984 --> 19:58.242
like that oddly proportioned
fellow in the cape...

19:58.367 --> 19:59.237
Come on!

19:59.362 --> 20:01.449
... but we're never gonna get
any answers that way.

20:01.788 --> 20:05.494
We need the money to fund
official/unofficial CIA torture.

20:05.856 --> 20:07.497
We're counting on your generosity.

20:07.839 --> 20:11.112
Stan, it's working!
The phones are ringing off the hook!

20:12.777 --> 20:16.027
That's it, folks.
Give till it hurts... him.

20:18.202 --> 20:19.342
We have the money!

20:19.556 --> 20:21.107
Quick, get the equipment.

20:23.028 --> 20:24.118
Hold this up.

20:30.242 --> 20:32.030
The code is 1-2-3-4-#.

20:36.063 --> 20:37.527
The bomb is disarmed!

20:39.423 --> 20:41.489
That's what I'm gonna say
when I disarm the bomb.

20:47.567 --> 20:50.081
The arm is disbombed.
Damn it.

20:58.037 --> 21:01.082
So now you can tell
Francine and the kids I'm not a liar.

21:01.207 --> 21:03.939
Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.
Well, that's our show, folks.

21:04.064 --> 21:06.185
If you're interested in learning
more about torture,

21:06.310 --> 21:08.460
follow an immigrant
into your local police station.

21:08.585 --> 21:09.681
Good night.
