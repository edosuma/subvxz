WEBVTT

00:07.875 --> 00:09.430
Previously on "Homeland"...

00:09.433 --> 00:11.285
I'm shredding documents and I see it...

00:11.288 --> 00:13.137
A gold pack of Nafisi's cigarettes.

00:13.139 --> 00:15.773
Mossad must have been briefing
him in that room before I arrived.

00:15.775 --> 00:17.442
You think the whole thing was a charade?

00:17.444 --> 00:20.144
- Awaiting confirmation.
- What kind of confirmation?

00:20.146 --> 00:21.645
Javadi.

00:21.647 --> 00:24.148
You want me to babysit?

00:24.150 --> 00:25.649
Would you?

00:27.520 --> 00:28.685
Terrorist!

00:32.491 --> 00:34.357
I want my mommy. I want my mommy!

00:34.359 --> 00:35.422
It's not safe.

00:35.425 --> 00:37.327
Got to get downstairs and out of sight.

00:37.329 --> 00:38.798
The shooter's position is confirmed.

00:38.800 --> 00:41.364
- Let's do it.
- No! You cannot do this!

00:41.366 --> 00:43.900
Did you hear me?! My
daughter is in there!

00:43.902 --> 00:45.434
- Move in!
- No!

00:45.436 --> 00:46.602
He's down!

00:46.604 --> 00:48.904
You said...

00:48.906 --> 00:50.372
"P-Protect Franny."

00:50.374 --> 00:51.740
Yes.

00:51.742 --> 00:52.908
Then you took me down.

00:52.910 --> 00:54.610
When my back was turned.

00:54.612 --> 00:55.755
What's this?

00:55.758 --> 00:57.613
Taken four hours before the explosion.

00:57.615 --> 00:59.215
You recognize the van?

00:59.217 --> 01:00.549
Who's that?

01:00.551 --> 01:02.783
I tracked down that blue Jeep,

01:02.785 --> 01:06.053
which then disappeared while I
was inside a very strange place.

01:06.055 --> 01:07.211
Strange how?

01:07.214 --> 01:09.491
I'm thinking we should
discuss in person.

01:09.493 --> 01:10.858
Can you get out to my house?

01:10.860 --> 01:11.993
Sure.

01:13.000 --> 01:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:25.489 --> 01:26.840
Where's my daughter?

01:26.842 --> 01:28.375
- Ms. Mathison.
- Where is she?

01:28.377 --> 01:30.344
Hey, sweetheart!

01:56.236 --> 01:57.800
The first revolution

01:57.803 --> 02:01.606
is when you change your mind
about how you look at things

02:01.608 --> 02:04.081
and see there might be
another way to look at it

02:04.084 --> 02:05.617
that you have not been shown.

02:07.947 --> 02:09.614
The brutality against protesters,

02:09.616 --> 02:11.148
the para-militarization
of law enforcement.

02:11.150 --> 02:13.150
That's why we have to keep trying.

02:13.152 --> 02:15.196
We don't need a police
state in this country

02:15.199 --> 02:16.620
to fight terrorism.

02:16.622 --> 02:18.289
We need a new strategy.

02:18.291 --> 02:20.658
The revolution will not be televised.

02:20.660 --> 02:22.593
The system of indefinite detention...

02:22.595 --> 02:24.662
FBI and the CIA targeting
Muslim communities...

02:24.664 --> 02:27.164
Security. Got an agitated
non-compliant patient.

02:27.166 --> 02:28.677
- Get away from me!
- What's his name again?

02:28.679 --> 02:30.546
- Peter Quinn.
- Peter Quinn.

02:30.549 --> 02:32.669
You will not be able
to stay home, brother.

02:32.671 --> 02:36.005
You will not be able to plug
in, turn on, and cop out.

02:36.007 --> 02:38.241
- It's a very alarming charge.
- The Russians

02:38.243 --> 02:39.975
hacked our committees.

02:39.977 --> 02:42.144
The continuation of endless war.

02:42.146 --> 02:44.488
Can't you get that
through your fucking skull?

02:44.491 --> 02:47.682
The revolution will put
you in the driver's seat.

02:47.685 --> 02:49.284
The U.S. continues to engage

02:49.286 --> 02:52.120
in a covert war with
very, very high stakes.

02:52.122 --> 02:54.823
I made promises and didn't keep them.

02:56.098 --> 02:58.973
This world began right after 9/11.

03:00.512 --> 03:02.663
The revolution will not be televised,

03:02.665 --> 03:03.715
not be televised.

03:03.718 --> 03:05.566
There will be no rerun,
brothers and sisters.

03:05.568 --> 03:08.168
The revolution will be live.

03:08.170 --> 03:10.137
Which agency?

03:10.139 --> 03:12.640
I can't say that here
in an open hearing, sir.

03:12.642 --> 03:14.408
You saved me.

03:14.410 --> 03:16.110
Yes.

03:16.112 --> 03:17.445
Why?

04:51.868 --> 04:53.034
Peter?

04:53.036 --> 04:54.669
You okay?

05:00.176 --> 05:01.742
It's me... Astrid.

05:03.479 --> 05:05.111
What are you doing up?

05:05.113 --> 05:07.748
They said you'd be out for
another 12 hours at least.

05:07.750 --> 05:09.683
Hey.

05:09.685 --> 05:13.086
Wh-Where am I?

05:13.088 --> 05:15.556
It's a good question.

05:17.392 --> 05:19.525
Middle of nowhere's the answer.

05:19.527 --> 05:21.894
Someplace called Upper Chateaugay...

05:21.896 --> 05:23.763
If that's even how you pronounce it.

05:23.765 --> 05:26.098
Astrid?

05:26.100 --> 05:27.834
Yeah. It's me.

05:30.137 --> 05:32.472
You're... You are...

05:32.474 --> 05:33.673
I'm here.

05:33.675 --> 05:36.408
Everything's gonna be fine now.

05:36.410 --> 05:39.110
What's happening?

05:40.147 --> 05:41.217
Nothing, nothing.

05:41.219 --> 05:42.606
You're just feeling the effects

05:42.609 --> 05:45.950
of the sedative the doctor gave you.

05:45.952 --> 05:48.186
What doctor?

05:48.188 --> 05:51.189
The one at the hospital.

05:51.191 --> 05:53.791
Don't let me forget.

05:53.793 --> 05:55.626
What, Peter?

05:55.628 --> 05:56.761
What?

05:56.763 --> 05:58.596
Carrie said...

05:58.598 --> 05:59.630
What?

05:59.632 --> 06:01.832
What did Carrie say?

06:01.834 --> 06:02.834
What?

06:07.239 --> 06:08.471
You getting this, Carrie?

06:08.473 --> 06:09.739
It's good.

06:09.741 --> 06:11.240
What about the backyard?

06:11.242 --> 06:15.478
Just press the star key.

06:15.480 --> 06:16.613
Yeah. It's good, too.

06:16.615 --> 06:19.248
Okay. Great. I'll be right in.

06:30.294 --> 06:31.794
See anything over there?

06:31.796 --> 06:34.095
No.

06:35.132 --> 06:37.466
Yeah.

06:37.468 --> 06:40.135
Me neither.

06:40.137 --> 06:42.206
I had eyes on the building all night.

06:43.339 --> 06:45.005
Did you get any sleep?

06:45.007 --> 06:46.441
No.

06:48.511 --> 06:51.712
Look, Carrie, I'm happy to
set up an alarm, cameras.

06:51.714 --> 06:54.982
I'll even stand guard at
the door with a rifle, but...

06:54.984 --> 06:57.051
I told you, I can't call the police.

06:57.053 --> 06:59.353
A bomb has been planted.
An FBI agent is dead.

06:59.355 --> 07:00.821
I-I don't know who these people are,

07:00.823 --> 07:02.489
but they are serious.

07:02.491 --> 07:04.324
And they're connected.

07:05.561 --> 07:07.093
I'm worried about you.

07:13.469 --> 07:14.668
It's Franny's school.

07:14.670 --> 07:16.235
I'll get to work on the alarm.

07:16.237 --> 07:17.570
- Hello?
- Carrie?

07:17.572 --> 07:19.538
This is Beth from St. Martha's.

07:19.540 --> 07:20.573
Is Franny okay?

07:20.575 --> 07:21.874
She's fine.

07:21.876 --> 07:23.642
But I think you should get over here.

07:23.644 --> 07:25.878
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. It's just...

07:25.880 --> 07:28.146
There's someone here
from Children's Services.

07:28.148 --> 07:29.414
What?

07:29.416 --> 07:30.883
Talking to her about what happened

07:30.885 --> 07:32.184
at your house two days ago,

07:32.186 --> 07:33.585
that police action.

07:33.587 --> 07:35.753
- My God.
- I thought you should know.

07:35.755 --> 07:38.456
Okay, I'm on my way.
Tell Franny I'm coming.

07:47.266 --> 07:49.300
Carrie, this is Christine Lonas.

07:49.302 --> 07:52.736
Hi, I'm from the Administration
for Children's Services.

07:52.738 --> 07:53.765
Hi.

07:53.768 --> 07:55.739
I need to speak to Ms. Mathison alone.

07:55.741 --> 07:57.007
Of course.

07:59.478 --> 08:01.478
Well, I've been talking to Franny...

08:01.480 --> 08:03.213
I want to see my daughter.

08:03.215 --> 08:04.982
Here, take a seat.

08:04.984 --> 08:06.817
Please.

08:13.057 --> 08:15.591
So, our agency is required by law

08:15.593 --> 08:17.259
to investigate any situation

08:17.261 --> 08:19.228
in which a child may have been harmed.

08:19.230 --> 08:20.429
She wasn't harmed.

08:20.431 --> 08:23.098
Not physically maybe.

08:23.100 --> 08:25.600
She was upset, n-naturally.

08:25.602 --> 08:26.935
Anybody would be. I was.

08:26.937 --> 08:29.604
But w-we talked the
whole thing through.

08:29.606 --> 08:31.072
She just...

08:31.074 --> 08:32.974
She just wants to get
her life back to normal.

08:32.976 --> 08:35.876
Well, that's not what I got
from my conversation with her.

08:37.581 --> 08:39.179
Really?

08:39.182 --> 08:41.815
What I saw was a bright,
sensitive little girl

08:41.817 --> 08:46.286
who was... traumatized
by a horrific event.

08:46.288 --> 08:48.121
"Traumatized" is a strong word.

08:48.123 --> 08:50.524
And her trauma was deepened
when you returned her

08:50.526 --> 08:53.326
to the site of the event only
one day after it happened.

08:53.328 --> 08:55.863
We talked about going
home. She was good with it.

08:55.865 --> 09:00.667
It's not safe psychologically
for her to be there.

09:00.669 --> 09:02.961
Look, I d... I don't agree with you,

09:02.964 --> 09:06.706
but I-I can take her
somewhere for a few days,

09:06.708 --> 09:09.275
to a hotel if you think that's best.

09:09.277 --> 09:11.010
For how long?

09:13.514 --> 09:16.114
After my talk with Franny,
I made a determination

09:16.116 --> 09:19.918
that she's at imminent
risk for further harm.

09:19.920 --> 09:21.252
What?

09:21.254 --> 09:23.321
She's been taken out of school

09:23.323 --> 09:27.859
and placed in a
state-registered youth home.

09:27.861 --> 09:29.928
You mean she's not here?

09:32.332 --> 09:34.865
She's my daughter! You
have no right to do this!

09:34.867 --> 09:38.377
Ms. Mathison, please, this
is just a temporary step

09:38.380 --> 09:40.370
until my office can further
assess the situation.

09:40.372 --> 09:43.240
No, the situation is, I need
to see my daughter right now.

09:43.242 --> 09:44.616
There are steps that need to be taken.

09:44.618 --> 09:47.123
No, you cannot just put
her in some institution!

09:47.126 --> 09:48.878
I agree. It's not ideal.

09:48.881 --> 09:50.413
Is there a-a family member

09:50.415 --> 09:53.216
who could take her in the meantime?

09:53.218 --> 09:55.018
- My sister.
- Good.

09:55.020 --> 09:56.385
How do I reach her?

09:56.387 --> 09:58.622
- You can't.
- What do you mean?

09:58.624 --> 09:59.956
Her husband's a professor.

09:59.958 --> 10:02.058
They're in Rome for
a year on sabbatical.

10:02.060 --> 10:03.359
This... This is bullshit.

10:04.896 --> 10:06.129
Thank you.

10:06.131 --> 10:07.529
Sorry.

10:11.636 --> 10:14.269
Look, this... isn't an appropriate place

10:14.271 --> 10:16.905
for us to be having this conversation.

10:16.907 --> 10:19.274
My office is ten minutes from here.

10:19.276 --> 10:22.711
What do you say we continue
the discussion there, okay?

10:25.882 --> 10:27.281
Okay.

10:27.283 --> 10:28.683
Good.

10:29.953 --> 10:33.755
Protesters greet a delegation
of Iranian finance ministers

10:33.757 --> 10:37.591
on a diplomatic mission to
expedite the easing of sanctions

10:37.593 --> 10:40.128
under the controversial
nuclear-arms treaty.

10:40.130 --> 10:42.428
Iran is insisting they have dismantled

10:42.430 --> 10:44.031
their nuclear-weapons program

10:44.033 --> 10:46.133
while claiming the U.S. is slow-rolling

10:46.135 --> 10:47.934
the promised economic relief.

10:47.936 --> 10:50.103
Gentlemen, I have your passports.

10:50.105 --> 10:51.604
Mr. Alibadi.

10:51.606 --> 10:53.306
- Thank you.
- Mr. Kasem.

10:53.308 --> 10:54.474
That's for you.

10:54.476 --> 10:55.840
Thank you.

10:55.843 --> 10:57.943
Mr. Karrubi.

10:57.945 --> 10:59.045
That's me.

10:59.047 --> 11:00.946
Welcome to New York.

11:00.948 --> 11:02.214
Thank you.

11:02.216 --> 11:04.383
- Mr. Falhadi.
- Right here.

11:04.385 --> 11:06.686
And, finally, Mr. Mohada.

11:06.688 --> 11:08.654
My colleague will
escort you to your cars.

11:08.656 --> 11:10.289
Enjoy your stay.

11:31.311 --> 11:33.243
Go back to your own country!

11:41.221 --> 11:43.887
You've never spoken publicly

11:43.889 --> 11:45.155
about your son.

11:45.157 --> 11:47.024
W-Why the change of heart?

11:47.026 --> 11:49.225
I realized I might've been giving people

11:49.227 --> 11:50.659
the wrong impression.

11:50.661 --> 11:52.228
What impression is that?

11:52.230 --> 11:54.831
Well, that somehow,
I wasn't proud of him

11:54.833 --> 11:58.935
or the sacrifice that he
and so many others made

11:58.937 --> 12:00.036
in this war.

12:00.038 --> 12:01.704
You were proud of him.

12:01.706 --> 12:05.341
Yes. Very much so.

12:05.343 --> 12:08.877
He loved his country. He
believed in the mission.

12:08.879 --> 12:10.678
He was...

12:10.680 --> 12:13.381
the light of my life, and I miss him

12:13.383 --> 12:16.017
every single moment of every day.

12:16.019 --> 12:18.887
What was he like? What
can you tell us about him?

12:18.889 --> 12:21.389
Well, he never dreamed
of being a soldier.

12:21.391 --> 12:22.423
I can tell you that.

12:22.425 --> 12:23.824
- No?
- No.

12:23.826 --> 12:25.592
Physics was his passion...

12:25.594 --> 12:28.229
Aerospace engineering, to be exact.

12:28.231 --> 12:29.764
9/11 changed all that.

12:29.766 --> 12:32.637
That's when he decided
to enroll at West Point?

12:32.640 --> 12:33.398
Yes.

12:33.401 --> 12:35.236
You didn't try to talk him out of it?

12:36.572 --> 12:38.405
You couldn't talk
Andrew out of anything,

12:38.407 --> 12:40.453
not once his mind was made up.

12:40.456 --> 12:44.543
And once he graduated, he
served three tours in Iraq?

12:44.545 --> 12:45.703
Two full tours.

12:45.706 --> 12:48.073
He was killed just at the
beginning of his third.

12:48.076 --> 12:51.125
And by then, you had
come out against the war.

12:51.128 --> 12:53.586
Yes, and he was furious about it.

12:53.588 --> 12:56.889
I remember he criticized
your Senate-floor speeches,

12:56.891 --> 12:59.892
saying they were aiding
and abetting the enemy.

12:59.894 --> 13:02.327
Yes.

13:02.329 --> 13:06.464
It was a very difficult
time for us as a family.

13:06.466 --> 13:09.067
He was doing what he believed was right,

13:09.069 --> 13:11.770
and I was doing what
I believed was right.

13:11.772 --> 13:14.172
When was the last time you saw him?

13:14.174 --> 13:16.573
2007, in Baghdad.

13:16.575 --> 13:20.812
The Pentagon was in the
middle of a charm offensive.

13:20.814 --> 13:22.613
"The surge is working.

13:22.615 --> 13:25.482
Victory is just over the horizon."

13:25.484 --> 13:28.419
I was there with a group
of skeptical senators.

13:28.421 --> 13:32.588
Well, now it's almost ten years later,

13:32.590 --> 13:35.091
and we are still there,

13:35.093 --> 13:38.216
and American soldiers are still dying.

13:38.219 --> 13:38.998
What a cunt.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.220
One of the longest war in our history.

13:40.222 --> 13:43.599
Yes, that's right. In fact, Syria

13:43.601 --> 13:46.970
is now the 14th country
in the Islamic world

13:46.972 --> 13:51.340
where U.S. forces have
invaded, occupied, or bombed,

13:51.342 --> 13:54.176
and that's just since 1980.

13:54.178 --> 13:56.178
She's winning the argument.

13:56.180 --> 13:59.014
She's a Gold Star mom.
She's tough to argue with.

13:59.016 --> 14:01.383
At lea... for now she is.

14:01.385 --> 14:03.886
On the ground, so we're talking...

14:03.888 --> 14:05.987
Did you know Javadi's in town?

14:05.990 --> 14:09.425
I was alerted the minute he
boarded the plane in Tehran.

14:09.428 --> 14:11.061
Well, what are you gonna do about it?

14:12.762 --> 14:15.096
He and Saul cannot meet.

14:15.098 --> 14:18.967
Otherwise, everything unravels.

14:18.969 --> 14:21.269
They won't.

14:24.658 --> 14:25.737
Some do.

14:25.740 --> 14:27.562
And there's always
going to be that debate,

14:27.565 --> 14:30.543
and that's... that's part
of the joy of a democracy.

14:32.514 --> 14:34.882
[elevator bell dings.

14:38.567 --> 14:39.766
How'd it go?

14:39.769 --> 14:41.287
Well, he got the ticket, sir.

14:41.289 --> 14:42.654
- Good.
- Mr. Berenson?

14:42.656 --> 14:44.490
You're needed in the conference room.

14:44.492 --> 14:45.892
What's this about?

14:45.894 --> 14:48.694
I can't say, but
apparently, it's urgent.

14:48.696 --> 14:50.629
Sure.

14:59.106 --> 15:02.207
Saul, Rachel Crofts... Deputy
in Counter-Intelligence.

15:02.209 --> 15:04.709
I know who you are. What's this about?

15:04.711 --> 15:06.211
We have a bit of an issue.

15:06.213 --> 15:07.779
I'm listening.

15:07.781 --> 15:09.680
The Director's asked me to debrief you

15:09.682 --> 15:11.616
on your recent visit to the West Bank.

15:11.618 --> 15:13.017
You're kidding.

15:13.019 --> 15:14.551
You came all the way up from Washington

15:14.553 --> 15:16.853
to ask me about a dinner
I had with my sister?

15:16.855 --> 15:18.455
Come on, Saul.

15:18.457 --> 15:20.424
You're there the same night
a senior Rev Guard commander

15:20.426 --> 15:23.693
is reported crossing
the Jordanian border.

15:23.695 --> 15:24.861
Says who?

15:24.863 --> 15:26.130
The Israelis.

15:27.166 --> 15:29.233
So that's what this is...

15:29.235 --> 15:32.235
Tovah Rivlin setting a backfire.

15:32.237 --> 15:35.271
Well, anyway you look at
it, the optics aren't good.

15:35.273 --> 15:37.106
I'm too old to worry about optics.

15:37.108 --> 15:39.575
If I did, I'd never look in the mirror.

15:39.577 --> 15:42.283
This isn't a laughing matter.

15:42.286 --> 15:44.471
The Director has been on
the receiving end of some

15:44.474 --> 15:47.781
very heated phone calls, and
not just from Tovah Rivlin.

15:47.784 --> 15:49.217
Look, I know this is a pain in the ass,

15:49.219 --> 15:51.353
but the Director is
hoping you'll cooperate

15:51.355 --> 15:53.055
so he can get Mossad off his back.

15:53.057 --> 15:54.889
Consider it a personal favor.

15:54.891 --> 15:56.624
I need to make a call first.

15:58.429 --> 16:01.196
This is awkward, but I need your phone.

16:01.198 --> 16:02.931
Why do you need my phone?

16:02.933 --> 16:06.800
To track your movements
in the West Bank.

16:06.802 --> 16:09.003
Is this a debrief or an interrogation?

16:09.005 --> 16:12.039
We just want to present a
thorough explanation to Mossad

16:12.041 --> 16:14.241
so we can close the
chapter on what I hope

16:14.243 --> 16:15.642
is just a misunderstanding.

16:16.712 --> 16:19.413
The sooner we begin,
the sooner we finish.

16:19.415 --> 16:21.314
Here you go.

16:34.096 --> 16:36.396
Look, I-I know what this is about.

16:36.398 --> 16:38.464
There was all this
craziness at my house,

16:38.466 --> 16:41.300
and somebody called your
agency, one of the neighbors or

16:41.302 --> 16:43.635
- a parent from Franny's school.
- Ms. Mathison...

16:43.637 --> 16:46.305
But they don't know me,
and they don't know Franny,

16:46.307 --> 16:47.973
and they don't know
what really happened.

16:47.975 --> 16:49.341
Well, that's why we're here

16:49.343 --> 16:51.176
so that you can tell me what happened.

16:51.178 --> 16:54.013
- I am a good mother.
- I understand.

16:54.015 --> 16:56.680
Why don't you start and
tell me about that day?

16:56.682 --> 16:58.616
- The day of the bombing.
- That's right.

16:58.618 --> 17:00.735
Okay. Well...

17:00.738 --> 17:03.321
I got a call from Reda Hashem,
my... my business partner...

17:04.656 --> 17:06.624
informing me that one of our clients

17:06.626 --> 17:09.227
was apparently driving
the truck that blew up.

17:09.229 --> 17:10.761
Imagine that was quite a shock.

17:10.762 --> 17:12.429
Yeah, to say the least.

17:12.431 --> 17:16.233
His family was distraught.
I had to get over there.

17:16.234 --> 17:20.670
And that's when you left
Franny with, Mr. Quinn?

17:20.672 --> 17:22.506
It was for ten minutes.

17:22.508 --> 17:23.940
Her nanny was on her way.

17:23.942 --> 17:26.943
Yes, ne of my colleagues spoke to her.

17:26.944 --> 17:28.811
The point is,

17:28.813 --> 17:30.913
I had to go, and there was no one else.

17:30.915 --> 17:33.815
Plus, Franny adores Quinn.

17:33.817 --> 17:35.851
Tell me about him.
What's your connection?

17:35.853 --> 17:37.420
We're former colleagues.

17:37.422 --> 17:40.789
We worked together at the
Central Intelligence Agency.

17:40.791 --> 17:42.491
Why is he living with you?

17:42.493 --> 17:44.993
Well, we're also friends,

17:44.995 --> 17:47.028
and he was recovering
from a brain injury

17:47.030 --> 17:50.298
at the Brooklyn V.A.,
but that didn't work out.

17:50.300 --> 17:52.500
So I couldn't let him
live on the street.

17:52.502 --> 17:54.869
I just got off
the phone with the V.A.

17:54.871 --> 17:57.072
I understand that Mr. Quinn suffers

17:57.074 --> 18:00.208
from bouts of rage and depression.

18:00.210 --> 18:01.842
Yeah.

18:01.844 --> 18:04.211
Yeah, there's some psychological issues.

18:04.213 --> 18:07.548
Including violent outbursts.

18:07.550 --> 18:09.983
He hated it at the V.A.

18:09.985 --> 18:13.820
Still, you moved him into your house.

18:13.822 --> 18:16.990
No, in-into the basement.
It's a separate apartment.

18:18.094 --> 18:19.460
There's a door that locks.

18:19.462 --> 18:21.660
There were very strict rules in place.

18:21.662 --> 18:22.995
E-Everything was fine.

18:22.997 --> 18:24.997
Right. Until the bombing.

18:24.999 --> 18:26.865
Yes, the press came to my house.

18:26.867 --> 18:28.292
There were people throwing rocks.

18:28.295 --> 18:29.660
There were police everywhere.

18:29.663 --> 18:31.394
Well, weren't they
there because Mr. Quinn

18:31.397 --> 18:33.238
was holding Franny
and your nanny hostage?

18:33.241 --> 18:36.374
- No! That is not accurate.
- He wasn't holding them hostage?

18:38.178 --> 18:40.378
Not from his point of view.

18:42.082 --> 18:46.318
Quinn is... Is a highly trained soldier.

18:46.320 --> 18:48.186
He believed that Franny was in danger,

18:48.188 --> 18:50.589
which, you know, she was,

18:50.591 --> 18:53.925
sh... from people throwing
rocks, from the police.

18:53.927 --> 18:56.093
He was doing what he
could to keep her safe.

18:56.095 --> 18:58.295
Do you think that Franny felt safe?

19:00.766 --> 19:05.202
W... I'm sure she was frightened,
but she's a strong girl.

19:11.343 --> 19:14.544
There's something I
want to share with you.

19:14.546 --> 19:15.978
What?

19:15.980 --> 19:17.680
During our conversation,

19:17.682 --> 19:20.383
Franny disclosed that she
didn't feel safe with Mr. Quinn.

19:20.385 --> 19:23.686
In fact, she said she was terrified.

19:23.688 --> 19:25.655
She thought she was gonna die.

19:31.862 --> 19:34.496
Yeah, I know that that is hard to hear.

19:40.037 --> 19:41.403
Sorry.

19:41.405 --> 19:44.873
Just...

19:44.875 --> 19:47.107
M-Ms. Lonas, when...

19:47.109 --> 19:49.143
when can I see her?

19:49.145 --> 19:53.581
What do I have to do?
I will do anything.

19:53.583 --> 19:54.520
You're doing it.

19:54.523 --> 19:57.718
Y-You are... helping
with the investigation.

19:57.720 --> 19:59.787
And how long will this take?

19:59.789 --> 20:03.156
I will try and get your case
before the judge tomorrow.

20:03.158 --> 20:05.024
And then Franny comes home?

20:05.026 --> 20:07.427
That's up to the judge.

20:10.432 --> 20:12.098
Now, do you have a lawyer?

20:19.140 --> 20:20.573
Peter?

20:23.877 --> 20:25.311
Peter?

20:33.020 --> 20:34.486
Peter!

20:39.926 --> 20:41.593
Peter!

20:45.932 --> 20:47.057
Peter!

20:48.935 --> 20:50.501
Peter!

21:20.698 --> 21:22.097
Peter.

21:22.099 --> 21:23.899
What are you doing?

21:23.901 --> 21:25.868
What's it look like?

21:25.870 --> 21:28.370
Freezing to death.

21:28.372 --> 21:30.672
Come on, let's at least
get you into the car,

21:30.674 --> 21:32.707
- where it's warm.
- No.

21:32.709 --> 21:34.776
I have to get back to New York.

21:34.778 --> 21:36.244
Well, that would be a mistake.

21:36.246 --> 21:37.412
We'll see.

21:37.414 --> 21:38.580
Peter.

21:38.582 --> 21:40.081
You will be arrested again.

21:40.083 --> 21:41.036
That's the deal...

21:41.039 --> 21:44.385
You stay out here,
out of the public eye.

21:44.387 --> 21:45.653
What deal?

21:47.423 --> 21:49.657
The deal Dar Adal made.

21:49.659 --> 21:52.393
Right now, you're an important
national-security asset.

21:52.395 --> 21:54.961
Break the terms, and you're
a national-security risk.

21:54.963 --> 21:59.600
Do I like a f-fucking risk to you?

21:59.602 --> 22:01.101
You shot a civilian, Peter.

22:01.103 --> 22:04.236
In the...

22:04.238 --> 22:05.471
safe place!

22:05.473 --> 22:08.675
Yeah, with a handgun, from distance.

22:08.677 --> 22:11.511
'Cause they were coming for me.

22:11.513 --> 22:13.145
Who is?

22:13.147 --> 22:15.315
The people.

22:15.317 --> 22:17.317
W-What people?

22:17.319 --> 22:21.420
The people who... built the bomb.

22:21.422 --> 22:22.654
What do you mean, the kid?

22:22.656 --> 22:23.955
No, not the kid!

22:23.957 --> 22:26.257
Peter, I-I don't understand.

22:26.259 --> 22:30.929
Exactly. I have to go find out.

22:30.931 --> 22:32.764
Hey!

22:32.766 --> 22:35.966
Hey!

22:35.968 --> 22:37.234
You folks okay?

22:37.236 --> 22:39.303
Hey, can I ride get a ride into town?

22:39.305 --> 22:40.471
Yeah, hop in.

22:40.473 --> 22:41.905
- Whoa, sir, trust me.
- Hey!

22:41.907 --> 22:44.308
You don't want to do this.
My husband's not well.

22:44.310 --> 22:46.310
I'm not her husband. She just lied.

22:46.312 --> 22:48.312
- Ignore him.
- Why are you lying?

22:48.314 --> 22:50.581
- He's off his...
- She's a German spy woman!

22:50.583 --> 22:52.115
He's off his meds.

22:52.117 --> 22:54.016
- She has me trapped in a...
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

22:54.018 --> 22:56.653
- Sorry, buddy. Not today.
- No! You have to help me!

22:56.655 --> 22:58.955
Whoa! Hey!

22:58.957 --> 23:00.957
Come on!

23:00.959 --> 23:03.593
Hey!!

24:12.259 --> 24:13.392
They got him.

24:13.394 --> 24:14.760
Good.

24:24.905 --> 24:27.111
At any point in the
course of the evening,

24:27.114 --> 24:29.607
did you leave the location,

24:29.609 --> 24:31.375
or did you receive a message there?

24:31.377 --> 24:32.911
Saul, I'm sorry.

24:32.913 --> 24:34.945
I just heard this was happening.

24:34.947 --> 24:36.580
I think we're done here, Rachel.

24:36.582 --> 24:38.214
But the Director asked me to...

24:38.216 --> 24:40.918
Let me handle the Director.

24:40.920 --> 24:42.185
You can go.

24:57.502 --> 25:00.536
I'm getting too old for this.

25:01.940 --> 25:04.640
They grilled you about your
trip to the West Bank?

25:04.642 --> 25:06.008
Yeah.

25:06.010 --> 25:08.043
Heads-up sure would've been nice.

25:08.045 --> 25:09.143
What do you mean?

25:09.145 --> 25:10.946
Come on, Dar.

25:10.948 --> 25:13.648
Counter-Intelligence wouldn't
send one of their shit-stirrers

25:13.650 --> 25:16.618
to debrief me... without your blessing.

25:16.620 --> 25:19.420
I didn't know she was here,
Saul, till a minute ago.

25:19.422 --> 25:20.555
I swear.

25:28.297 --> 25:30.297
Got my phone?

25:30.299 --> 25:31.532
Yeah.

25:33.769 --> 25:35.435
Thanks.

25:44.946 --> 25:46.513
Yeah, I understand.

25:46.515 --> 25:47.847
Yeah.

25:47.849 --> 25:50.149
Yeah. Got it.

25:50.151 --> 25:52.018
Okay, you've got my contact info,

25:52.020 --> 25:54.521
so just call me directly
if anything else comes up.

25:54.523 --> 25:56.990
Thank you.

25:56.992 --> 25:58.892
Here's what I've been able to find out.

25:58.894 --> 26:00.626
They're moving Franny to a private home.

26:00.628 --> 26:01.827
She has a home.

26:01.829 --> 26:02.995
They're a highly regarded family.

26:02.997 --> 26:04.414
They've got two kids of their own.

26:04.417 --> 26:07.098
One is close to Franny's age.
It'll be like a sleepover.

26:07.101 --> 26:08.551
With people she doesn't know.

26:08.554 --> 26:10.949
Wh-What are they telling
her? She must be freaking out!

26:10.952 --> 26:12.485
It's one night, Carrie.

26:12.488 --> 26:14.654
We're scheduled to be in
court tomorrow afternoon.

26:14.657 --> 26:17.641
I can't just sit here
and allow this to happen.

26:17.644 --> 26:19.544
You've got no choice.

26:20.613 --> 26:22.046
Look at it this way.

26:22.048 --> 26:23.981
Franny has been through
something terrifying.

26:23.983 --> 26:26.851
The caseworkers are just doing
what they're supposed to do,

26:26.853 --> 26:28.485
protecting the child in question.

26:28.487 --> 26:30.521
Franny doesn't need their protection.

26:30.523 --> 26:32.097
And when the judge
realizes that tomorrow,

26:32.099 --> 26:33.099
he'll send her home.

31:09.919 --> 31:11.351
For the most part,

31:11.353 --> 31:13.987
Ms. Mathison is an
involved, concerned parent.

31:13.989 --> 31:17.024
Recently, she moved to Brooklyn
and started a new career

31:17.026 --> 31:19.793
in an effort to become a
more consistent presence

31:19.795 --> 31:21.328
in Franny's life.

31:21.330 --> 31:23.495
However, I found that
Ms. Mathison's efforts

31:23.497 --> 31:25.531
to provide a stable
environment for Franny

31:25.533 --> 31:29.435
have been undermined
by some... blind spots.

31:29.437 --> 31:33.105
For example, she brought a
mentally disturbed veteran,

31:33.107 --> 31:35.174
Peter Quinn, into her home.

31:35.176 --> 31:37.844
I-I thought I explained that?

31:37.846 --> 31:40.145
This led to an incident
which Mr. Quinn held.

31:40.147 --> 31:42.513
Franny and her nanny
hostage for several hours.

31:42.515 --> 31:44.482
I described it in detail in my report.

31:44.484 --> 31:45.885
I've read it.

31:45.888 --> 31:48.019
Your Honor, Quinn thought
he was protecting Franny.

31:48.021 --> 31:50.655
You'll have your chance to
address the court, Ms. Mathison.

31:50.657 --> 31:52.090
I'm sorry, but y-you should know

31:52.092 --> 31:54.092
that Quinn is no longer
living in my home.

31:54.094 --> 31:55.660
It's an important point, Your Honor.

31:55.662 --> 31:58.229
If the main issue is Franny's
exposure to Mr. Quinn,

31:58.231 --> 31:59.763
that problem has been resolved.

31:59.765 --> 32:02.010
Your Honor, even with Mr.
Quinn removed from the home,

32:02.013 --> 32:03.868
Franny continues to be at risk.

32:03.870 --> 32:05.435
From who.

32:05.437 --> 32:07.404
Well, from her mother.

32:07.406 --> 32:10.341
This morning, I conducted my
second interview with Franny.

32:10.343 --> 32:15.078
In this conversation, she
disclosed a disturbing fact.

32:15.080 --> 32:16.812
Two nights ago, she woke up

32:16.814 --> 32:18.681
and discovered her mother in her room.

32:18.683 --> 32:20.250
So?

32:20.252 --> 32:22.986
Ms. Mathison was sitting on
the floor near Franny's bed,

32:22.988 --> 32:26.256
asleep, with a gun in her lap.

32:29.227 --> 32:31.626
Ms. Mathison, is that true?

32:36.400 --> 32:38.700
I did have a gun, but I was not asleep.

32:38.702 --> 32:41.436
That's not what her daughter said.

32:41.438 --> 32:43.438
Was the gun loaded, Ms. Mathison?

32:49.745 --> 32:51.379
Answer the question.

32:53.416 --> 32:54.982
Yes, it was.

32:57.420 --> 33:00.254
Putting aside for a moment
whether or not you were asleep,

33:00.256 --> 33:01.956
can you explain what you were doing

33:01.958 --> 33:04.058
in your daughter's
room with a loaded gun?

33:04.060 --> 33:05.758
I had reason to fear

33:05.760 --> 33:07.928
for my safety, Your Honor, and Franny's.

33:07.930 --> 33:09.429
Why didn't you call the police?

33:13.435 --> 33:15.764
If you felt you were in danger,

33:15.767 --> 33:19.339
why not call the police?

33:20.775 --> 33:23.275
Your Honor, I'm a former
intelligence officer.

33:23.277 --> 33:25.010
I used to work for the CIA.

33:26.280 --> 33:27.612
Go on.

33:27.614 --> 33:29.448
I've been trained to handle firearms

33:29.450 --> 33:31.650
and deal with threatening situations.

33:31.652 --> 33:34.053
Lately, at my home,
there have been times

33:34.055 --> 33:36.755
when that I felt that
Franny and I were in danger,

33:36.757 --> 33:39.557
so I responded in the
way that I was trained.

33:39.559 --> 33:40.959
By spending the night

33:40.961 --> 33:42.626
next to your daughter with a loaded gun?

33:42.628 --> 33:43.794
The safety was on.

33:43.796 --> 33:45.396
But the gun was loaded.

33:45.398 --> 33:47.398
Your daughter's
sleeping a few feet away.

33:47.400 --> 33:49.600
Do you think that's reasonable?

33:49.602 --> 33:52.502
Two days before, I had
people out on the street

33:52.505 --> 33:55.206
throwing rocks at my house,
calling me a terrorist.

33:55.209 --> 33:57.841
Aren't the police prepared to
handle a situation like that?

33:57.843 --> 33:59.609
Well, the last time the
police came to my house,

33:59.611 --> 34:01.311
things didn't turn out so well.

34:01.313 --> 34:03.880
So you're saying you can
handle a dangerous situation

34:03.882 --> 34:05.208
better than the police?

34:06.485 --> 34:07.650
No.

34:07.652 --> 34:09.364
No, I-I do not mean that.

34:09.367 --> 34:12.789
I mean I have worked
intense environments

34:12.791 --> 34:14.723
in... in Baghdad and Islamabad.

34:14.725 --> 34:17.092
I-I don't panic in dangerous situations.

34:17.094 --> 34:19.261
I can keep my head clear.

34:19.263 --> 34:21.230
But in terms of my home,

34:21.232 --> 34:22.965
the demonstrators haven't come back,

34:22.967 --> 34:24.467
so that danger has passed,

34:24.469 --> 34:26.502
and Quinn is no longer
living in the house.

34:26.504 --> 34:30.105
So I'm confident that Franny
will be safe at home with me.

34:31.464 --> 34:33.130
Your Honor...

34:33.134 --> 34:36.978
Ms. Mathison's neglected to
tell the court an important fact.

34:36.980 --> 34:38.279
Go on.

34:38.281 --> 34:40.348
She suffers from bipolar disorder.

34:40.350 --> 34:41.849
- What?!
- That is out of line.

34:41.851 --> 34:44.452
Is this true?

34:44.454 --> 34:46.021
Yes, but I take medication.

34:46.023 --> 34:48.522
I haven't had an episode in over a year.

34:48.524 --> 34:51.025
She's been hospitalized
for her disorder twice

34:51.027 --> 34:53.193
and received electroconvulsive therapy.

34:53.195 --> 34:56.030
Your Honor, depriving a
parent of her custodial rights

34:56.032 --> 34:58.499
because of an illness is
blatant discrimination.

34:58.501 --> 35:01.235
Not if the illness endangers a child.

35:01.237 --> 35:04.537
And Ms. Mathison's claims
about mysterious threats

35:04.539 --> 35:06.239
and distrust of the police

35:06.241 --> 35:08.574
sound exactly like
symptoms of a manic episode.

35:08.576 --> 35:09.875
There were threats.

35:09.877 --> 35:11.792
They had nothing to do with my illness.

35:11.795 --> 35:12.994
Quiet, please.

35:18.219 --> 35:20.186
What is the agency's recommendation?

35:20.188 --> 35:21.653
Bottom line, Your Honor,

35:21.655 --> 35:24.022
Ms. Mathison fell asleep
in her daughter's bedroom

35:24.024 --> 35:25.524
with a loaded gun.

35:25.526 --> 35:27.859
Our assessment is that, this fact alone

35:27.861 --> 35:30.571
meets the legal requirement
of imminent risk.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.435
I'm going to accept the
agency's recommendation.

35:36.437 --> 35:38.269
Ms. Mathison, you'll be required

35:38.271 --> 35:41.272
to undergo psychiatric evaluation.

35:41.274 --> 35:44.841
Ms. Lonas, I'd like you
to prepare a home study

35:44.843 --> 35:46.944
and a deeper background investigation.

35:46.946 --> 35:48.212
Yes, Your Honor.

35:48.214 --> 35:50.081
Franny will remain in foster care

35:50.083 --> 35:52.916
until more information is
provided at further proceedings.

35:52.918 --> 35:54.518
- No!
- This session is adjourned.

35:56.888 --> 35:59.389
I'm gonna talk to her.
I'll be right back.

36:29.852 --> 36:32.232
Popcorn! Cotton candy!

36:43.266 --> 36:44.332
Excuse me.

36:49.952 --> 36:51.319
Sure you have the right seat?

36:53.908 --> 36:55.975
You're Saul.

36:55.977 --> 36:57.977
I am. Who are you?

36:57.979 --> 36:59.312
Amir.

36:59.314 --> 37:01.148
You and I have a friend in common.

37:01.150 --> 37:02.720
Where is our friend?

37:02.723 --> 37:05.951
Someplace safe, waiting for you.

37:05.953 --> 37:07.886
Why didn't he come?

37:07.888 --> 37:09.721
He'll explain when you see him.

37:09.723 --> 37:11.657
Come, I'll take you to him.

37:15.463 --> 37:17.429
Our friend said I should send greetings

37:17.431 --> 37:18.775
from Sergeant Brody.

37:23.102 --> 37:24.935
Let's go.

39:02.596 --> 39:04.796
Majid.

39:04.798 --> 39:07.132
Kindly explain what
the fuck is going on.

39:07.134 --> 39:08.500
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

39:08.502 --> 39:10.369
If it wasn't for that
loyal man in the car,

39:10.371 --> 39:12.571
I'd be dead right now... Maybe worse.

39:12.573 --> 39:13.872
What happened?

39:13.874 --> 39:16.040
I was picked up by my own service,

39:16.042 --> 39:18.076
accused of being a traitor.

39:18.078 --> 39:19.910
Who knew I was coming to New York?

39:19.912 --> 39:21.044
No one.

39:21.046 --> 39:22.580
No one?

39:22.582 --> 39:25.015
Then who was aware of our
meeting in the West Bank?

39:28.254 --> 39:31.555
The Israelis suspected it.

39:31.557 --> 39:33.491
But only one other person knew for sure.

39:34.894 --> 39:37.527
Dar Adal... I told him about it myself.

39:39.097 --> 39:42.131
The same Dar Adal who's
been trying to undermine

39:42.133 --> 39:44.133
the nuclear deal every step of the way?

39:44.135 --> 39:45.769
That was over three years ago.

39:45.771 --> 39:47.837
If he was gonna burn you...

39:47.839 --> 39:49.639
time was then, not now.

39:49.641 --> 39:53.075
Not if he thinks that we are
building a bomb in North Korea.

39:53.077 --> 39:54.610
Are you...

39:54.612 --> 39:57.112
building a bomb in North Korea?

40:07.057 --> 40:08.357
Who's this?

40:08.359 --> 40:10.792
Your friend the banker, Farhad Nafisi.

40:12.395 --> 40:14.862
He's a little hard
to recognize, I admit.

40:14.864 --> 40:18.299
Wild guess... He's working for Mossad.

40:18.301 --> 40:20.702
For the past eight years.

40:20.704 --> 40:23.037
Including the little
show they put on for you

40:23.039 --> 40:24.739
in Abu Dhabi.

40:24.741 --> 40:27.041
You have him on camera
admitting as much?

40:28.377 --> 40:30.310
Show me.

40:33.014 --> 40:36.516
First, I want political asylum.

40:36.518 --> 40:37.851
Of course.

40:37.853 --> 40:40.740
Plus, I want 'round-the-clock protection

40:40.743 --> 40:43.390
and access to my $45 million.

40:43.392 --> 40:46.024
That's gonna be a little trickier.

40:47.695 --> 40:50.229
Wait a minute.

40:50.231 --> 40:51.530
I'm listening.

40:51.532 --> 40:52.965
I can put you in front of someone

40:52.967 --> 40:54.199
who can make it happen.

40:55.936 --> 40:57.670
The President-elect.

41:02.208 --> 41:04.376
Go on.

41:04.378 --> 41:06.611
And she can hear it
from your own lips...

41:06.613 --> 41:09.614
Iran isn't cheating on the deal.

41:09.616 --> 41:13.385
There's no parallel
program in North Korea.

41:13.387 --> 41:16.454
Nothing would give me greater pleasure.

41:16.456 --> 41:17.989
Believe me.

41:20.559 --> 41:22.393
Amir!

41:22.395 --> 41:23.960
I'll set up the meeting.

41:27.232 --> 41:28.632
Hello. Saul Berenson.

41:28.634 --> 41:30.601
Well, I need to speak
to him immediately.

41:30.603 --> 41:32.903
It's urgent.

41:32.905 --> 41:35.005
Yes...

41:44.482 --> 41:47.983
Majid...

41:47.985 --> 41:49.318
for Chrissake.

41:49.320 --> 41:50.920
What?

41:50.922 --> 41:52.454
No loose ends.

41:52.456 --> 41:54.790
You taught me that, Saul.

41:54.792 --> 41:56.090
Come on.

41:56.092 --> 41:58.038
Help me put him in the trunk.

42:14.744 --> 42:15.943
Where is he?

42:15.945 --> 42:17.377
Down by the lake.

42:19.415 --> 42:22.583
He hasn't said a word...
not since I called you.

42:22.585 --> 42:24.752
But he knows I'm coming?

42:24.754 --> 42:27.286
Seemed to calm him down.

42:27.288 --> 42:29.088
I didn't know what else to do.

42:29.090 --> 42:31.190
No, no, you did the right thing.

42:31.192 --> 42:32.592
What have you told him?

42:33.628 --> 42:36.996
What I know, which isn't much.

42:36.998 --> 42:38.598
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea,

42:38.600 --> 42:39.632
me coming.

42:39.634 --> 42:41.334
Listen.

42:41.336 --> 42:44.135
Convincing him was never gonna be easy.

42:44.137 --> 42:46.268
You being here is gonna
make all the difference.

42:46.271 --> 42:47.570
Trust me.

42:49.510 --> 42:52.177
So, you want to do this alone or...

42:52.179 --> 42:53.645
Alone.

43:15.087 --> 43:16.352
What the hell is this?

43:19.170 --> 43:20.604
Feeling sorry for yourself?

43:20.606 --> 43:22.432
Go fuck yourself, Dar.

43:24.743 --> 43:26.910
Because if you are,
that would be a first.

43:29.147 --> 43:33.416
You grew up in a hard
school, no time for self-pity.

43:33.418 --> 43:37.319
It's the first thing
about you that impressed.

43:37.321 --> 43:40.155
Not the first thing.

43:40.157 --> 43:43.225
Yeah, well...

43:43.227 --> 43:45.694
we're all beautiful when
we're young, aren't we?

43:45.696 --> 43:50.065
Fucking... dirty old man.

43:50.067 --> 43:52.934
Fair enough.

43:52.936 --> 43:55.503
For the record, though, I...

43:55.505 --> 43:59.140
I never forced myself on anyone.

44:00.977 --> 44:02.911
I'm not staying here.

44:02.913 --> 44:05.580
Yes, you are. Astrid will look after you

44:05.582 --> 44:07.214
till you can look after yourself.

44:07.216 --> 44:09.082
No.

44:09.084 --> 44:13.554
The alternative is
prison or the psych ward.

44:13.556 --> 44:15.822
That's the truth, Peter.

44:15.824 --> 44:18.191
And what's so bad?

44:18.193 --> 44:20.226
Isn't this what you always dreamed of?

44:20.228 --> 44:23.564
A house on a lake. Or do
I have that wrong, too?

44:23.566 --> 44:26.131
Why don't you just
put me in a fuckin'...

44:29.571 --> 44:30.903
Collar.

44:30.905 --> 44:33.505
Collar! Thank you.

44:39.113 --> 44:42.247
What's so important you
have to get back to New York?

44:42.249 --> 44:44.248
Astrid mentioned on the phone

44:44.250 --> 44:46.651
you were talking about the attack.

44:46.653 --> 44:50.555
The bomb that went off...
Why are you so interested?

44:50.557 --> 44:51.701
What's it to you?

44:55.829 --> 44:58.262
Well, if you won't say, I will.

44:58.264 --> 45:00.194
It's Carrie Mathison.

45:01.934 --> 45:04.267
Her foundation represented the bomber.

45:04.269 --> 45:07.137
She's what's pulling you back
to New York, isn't that it?

45:07.139 --> 45:09.773
No.

45:09.775 --> 45:13.376
The sway she holds over you... and Saul,

45:13.378 --> 45:16.580
I'll never understand...
Fuck, it's cold out here!

45:16.582 --> 45:19.448
I believe they had a name
for her in Kabul, didn't they,

45:19.450 --> 45:20.950
when she was Station Chief there.

45:20.952 --> 45:22.619
What was it again?

45:22.621 --> 45:24.420
"The Angel of Death"?

45:24.422 --> 45:25.588
"The Drone Queen."

45:25.590 --> 45:26.623
Yeah.

45:26.625 --> 45:28.057
And in Berlin?

45:28.059 --> 45:29.859
Just stop, Dar.

45:33.931 --> 45:37.332
I assume you never
heard the whole story...

45:37.334 --> 45:39.868
of your medical ordeal there.

45:39.870 --> 45:41.970
Yeah, I did. Carrie told me.

45:41.972 --> 45:44.773
What'd she say?

45:44.775 --> 45:46.975
That I...

45:46.977 --> 45:50.311
flatlined and was
dead for three minutes.

45:53.116 --> 45:56.283
Not exactly.

45:56.285 --> 45:59.020
What do you mean?

45:59.022 --> 46:01.956
You were in a coma, Peter, a deep coma.

46:01.958 --> 46:04.992
Carrie ordered the
doctors to wake you up.

46:04.994 --> 46:07.861
She did this despite repeated warnings

46:07.863 --> 46:09.896
about the risks of the procedure.

46:09.898 --> 46:12.132
She thought you might have information

46:12.134 --> 46:14.801
on the terror cell that
was plotting the attack

46:14.803 --> 46:17.303
on Hauptbahnhof.

46:17.305 --> 46:18.972
She was wrong.

46:27.715 --> 46:30.015
W-What risks?

46:30.017 --> 46:33.819
The main one was massive
cerebral hemorrhage.

46:33.821 --> 46:35.554
Stroke.

46:38.559 --> 46:39.858
You think she's been

46:39.860 --> 46:41.359
taking care of you all these months

46:41.361 --> 46:43.527
out of love?

46:43.529 --> 46:46.741
Sounds a lot more like
guilt if you ask me.

46:49.535 --> 46:52.203
I bought you this one chance.

46:55.274 --> 46:57.641
There won't be another.

47:54.296 --> 47:56.296
Hello. This is Carrie Mathison.

47:56.298 --> 48:00.000
C-Can you, put me through
to the President-elect?

48:01.804 --> 48:03.804
Yes! I know what time it is. I'm sorry.

48:03.806 --> 48:05.172
Yes. I know.

48:05.174 --> 48:08.674
It's... It's urgent.

48:11.512 --> 48:12.912
Carrie?

48:12.914 --> 48:15.114
Madame President-elect.

48:17.051 --> 48:18.785
Is something wrong?

48:18.787 --> 48:23.222
Children's Services has
put Franny into foster care.

48:23.224 --> 48:25.791
I don't... I don't know where she is.

48:25.793 --> 48:28.093
They won't... They won't tell me.

48:28.095 --> 48:30.395
I-I haven't... I haven't
been able to see her.

48:30.397 --> 48:33.231
I'm sorry.

48:33.233 --> 48:37.903
I-I was thinking that with
all your contacts in Albany,

48:37.905 --> 48:41.105
that m-maybe y-you know
someone who oversees the agency

48:41.107 --> 48:42.739
or... or... Or the judge.

48:42.741 --> 48:46.076
Just... someone you could call.

48:47.479 --> 48:49.079
Call to...?

48:49.081 --> 48:51.782
To... To vouch for me, you know?

48:51.784 --> 48:54.819
T-To...

48:54.821 --> 48:58.221
To tell them how... How wrong this is.

49:00.826 --> 49:02.859
I can't use the office of the President

49:02.861 --> 49:05.028
to solve a personal problem.

49:05.030 --> 49:06.996
Well, it's just a call.

49:06.998 --> 49:09.665
It's unethical.

49:09.667 --> 49:11.400
I'm surprised you would even ask me.

49:11.402 --> 49:16.305
My daughter is in... Is
in some stranger's house,

49:16.307 --> 49:19.474
just lying there, thinking
I've abandoned her!

49:19.476 --> 49:21.076
Have you been inking?

49:21.078 --> 49:24.947
No. No!

49:24.949 --> 49:26.648
I just...

49:26.650 --> 49:28.317
I just thought that... That...

49:28.319 --> 49:31.653
That you, of all
people, would understand.

49:31.655 --> 49:33.988
I me...

49:33.990 --> 49:35.837
You lost a child.

49:41.898 --> 49:43.731
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

49:46.302 --> 49:47.668
Yeah, may...

49:47.670 --> 49:50.370
M-Maybe that was... That was too far.

49:50.372 --> 49:52.038
I'm sorry. I just...

49:52.040 --> 49:55.408
Jesus. I-I... What...
What am I supposed to do?

49:55.410 --> 49:56.576
I don't know.

49:56.578 --> 49:58.979
But I can't help you. I'm sorry.

49:58.981 --> 50:00.413
I have to go.

50:21.235 --> 50:23.368
Hello?

50:23.370 --> 50:26.737
Hello? It's Christine Lonas from ACS.

50:26.739 --> 50:29.707
I just wanted to let you know
that Franny's in foster care.

50:29.709 --> 50:32.710
She'll stay there for
the foreseeable future.

50:32.712 --> 50:34.913
I don't enjoy taking a
child from her mother,

50:34.915 --> 50:37.782
but in this case, it's
clearly the right thing to do.

50:37.784 --> 50:39.950
That's why I contacted you.

50:39.952 --> 50:41.451
Well, I appreciate it.

50:41.453 --> 50:44.354
The information you
supplied was very helpful.

50:44.356 --> 50:46.290
Thanks for letting me know.
