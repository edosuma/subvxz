 at home.

00:04.137 --> 00:07.137
 Ever!

00:08.708 --> 00:11.708
 NARRATOR: On this "Way too drunk
 to drive" episode,

00:12.445 --> 00:15.047
 Adam and Jamie get sloshed
 for science.

00:15.048 --> 00:16.415
 Whoo!

00:16.416 --> 00:18.017
 I usually
 don't let people do that.

00:18.018 --> 00:21.018
 NARRATOR: What is the best way
 to get sober in a hurry?

00:21.488 --> 00:23.188
 Oh!

00:23.189 --> 00:26.189
 NARRATOR: And is the myth
 of beer goggles fact or fantasy?

00:27.260 --> 00:29.161
 She's pretty darn cute.

00:29.162 --> 00:31.063
 NARRATOR:
 Then, Kari, Grant, and Tory

00:31.064 --> 00:34.064
 rebuild an ancient weapon
 of mass destruction.

00:34.834 --> 00:36.869
 Hwacha!

00:36.870 --> 00:39.071
 NARRATOR:
 They start with one fire arrow,

00:39.072 --> 00:41.573
 then try launching 200

00:41.574 --> 00:44.574
 to see if the hwacha
 lives up to its legend.

00:48.281 --> 00:50.649
 Who are the Mythbusters?

00:56.589 --> 00:58.323
 NARRATOR:
...and Jamie Hyneman.

00:58.324 --> 00:59.725
 Feel like I'm ready
 to go out clubbing.

00:59.726 --> 01:02.161
 NARRATOR:
 Between them, more than 30 years

01:02.162 --> 01:03.729
 of special-effects experience.

01:03.730 --> 01:04.629

 High explosives and electricity.
 Whoo!

01:15.708 --> 01:18.544
 NARRATOR: They don't just tell
 the myths...

01:18.545 --> 01:21.545
 they put them to the test.

01:30.123 --> 01:33.123
 Let's wet our whistles
 with the myth of beer goggles.

01:34.694 --> 01:37.694
 I'm feeling
 a little left out here.

01:38.064 --> 01:40.466
 And I'm glad.
 What's going on?

01:40.467 --> 01:41.533
 Beer goggles.

01:41.534 --> 01:43.268
 -Beer goggles?
 -Beer goggles!

01:43.269 --> 01:44.870
 It's been out there
 waiting for us the whole time,

01:44.871 --> 01:46.472
 and for some reason,
 we haven't tested it --

01:46.473 --> 01:49.374
 the idea that alcohol has
 this magical property

01:49.375 --> 01:52.144
 that will make people around you
 more attractive

01:52.145 --> 01:53.345
 the more you drink.

01:53.346 --> 01:55.147
 Actually, I feel like I've been
 testing this for over a decade.

01:55.148 --> 01:57.082
 Yes!
 But that's anecdotally.

01:57.083 --> 01:59.284
 We are going to test it
 scientifically.

01:59.285 --> 02:02.285
 Great.
 More drinking on the job.

02:04.057 --> 02:07.057
 NARRATOR: Jamie knows that
 eventually this will turn ugly.

02:07.760 --> 02:09.862
 They'll have to lose
 their inhibitions,

02:09.863 --> 02:12.863
 and maybe their lunch, to test
 the truth of beer goggles.

02:13.633 --> 02:16.068
 This seems to be
 a really subjective thing.

02:16.069 --> 02:18.437
 We need to be objective
 if we're gonna be scientific.

02:18.438 --> 02:20.539
 -How are we gonna do that?
 -Large sample size?

02:20.540 --> 02:21.673
 That's exactly
 what I'm thinking.

02:21.674 --> 02:24.143
 And I'm thinking
 that we rate photos.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.844
 Specifically,
 we get a bunch of photos --

02:25.845 --> 02:27.513
 us of women, you of men.

02:27.514 --> 02:30.514
 We review a whole bunch
 and rate them when we're sober.

02:31.451 --> 02:34.153
 And then we get drunk
 and re-rate those photos.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.454
 And see
 if there's a difference.

02:35.455 --> 02:38.190
 Exactly.

02:38.191 --> 02:40.526
 NARRATOR:
 But before we raise our glasses,

02:40.527 --> 02:42.494
 let's meet the newest member
 of the team,

02:42.495 --> 02:44.796
 with a vital role to play.

02:44.797 --> 02:46.498
 This is our new SMART Board.

02:46.499 --> 02:48.901
 Not only is it a really big,
 beautiful interface,

02:48.902 --> 02:50.869
 but it's also interactive.

02:50.870 --> 02:52.337
 Let me show you a couple tricks.

02:52.338 --> 02:54.439
 Watch this.

02:54.440 --> 02:56.175
 [ Laughs ]

02:56.176 --> 02:58.810
 How about that, huh?
 Huh?

02:58.811 --> 03:01.046
 You like that?
 It gets better. Check it out.

03:01.047 --> 03:03.415
 Not only can I even do that,

03:03.416 --> 03:06.416
 I can also diagram what's
 gonna happen in real time.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.222
 I'm not gonna go
 too much farther

03:10.223 --> 03:11.490
 showing the tricks
 this thing can do,

03:11.491 --> 03:12.891
 'cause we're about to use it
 a whole bunch

03:12.892 --> 03:15.561
 in this very episode.

03:15.562 --> 03:18.562
 NARRATOR: The board's first job
 is to help Adam, still sober,

03:19.532 --> 03:22.532
 rate the looks of 30 women
 from 1 to 10.

03:23.369 --> 03:24.703
 Here we go.

03:24.704 --> 03:27.704
 NARRATOR: He's got just five
 seconds to score each photo.

03:28.274 --> 03:31.274
 He can see the time tick down
 on the left of the screen.

03:31.444 --> 03:34.213
 ADAM: I got to say, the exercise
 of giving a quick rating,

03:34.214 --> 03:35.781
 it doesn't feel great.

03:35.782 --> 03:37.950
 It's kind of an awful thing
 to have to do.

03:37.951 --> 03:39.484
 [ Chuckles ]

03:39.485 --> 03:40.519
 Aah!

03:40.520 --> 03:43.520
 Like, I found myself resisting
 giving a 1 or a 2, but...

03:44.424 --> 03:45.991
 NARRATOR:
 Yeah? But?

03:45.992 --> 03:48.860
 I got a 96!
 [ Laughs ]

03:48.861 --> 03:51.861
 So the total possible score
 is potentially 300.

03:53.066 --> 03:56.066
 Out of that, I gave a 96.

03:56.102 --> 03:58.237
 The question from here on in
 will be,

03:58.238 --> 04:01.238
 as I drink,
 will my overall score go up?

04:01.874 --> 04:04.874
 NARRATOR: Now it's Kari's turn
 to rate the chaps.

04:05.745 --> 04:08.313
 KARI: Quite honestly, there are
 no supermodels on here.

04:08.314 --> 04:11.216
 Oh, God.
 Do I rate you on your hair?

04:11.217 --> 04:14.217
 Mm!

04:15.588 --> 04:17.723
 NARRATOR:
 Kari's either much more generous

04:17.724 --> 04:20.058
 or less discriminating
 than Adam.

04:20.059 --> 04:20.892
 [ Ding! ]

04:20.892 --> 04:23.893
 Okay.
 Total score -- 154.

04:24.063 --> 04:26.798
 NARRATOR: But she does know
 what pushes her buttons.

04:26.799 --> 04:29.799
 I noticed I was rating higher
 on men that looked confident.

04:30.169 --> 04:31.903
 If they looked
 sort of squirrelly

04:31.904 --> 04:34.172
 and really apprehensive
 about the whole thing,

04:34.173 --> 04:36.308
 I definitely gave them
 a lower score.

04:36.309 --> 04:39.309
 NARRATOR: Now for a man
 who's anything but squirrelly.

04:39.479 --> 04:41.380
 -Your turn.
 -Okay.

04:41.381 --> 04:44.381
 JAMIE: I'm about to look
 at a bunch of pictures of women,

04:44.417 --> 04:46.818
 apparently,
 and try to objectify them.

04:46.819 --> 04:48.120
 [ Laughs ]

04:48.121 --> 04:49.921
 NARRATOR:
 Jamie's got a point.

04:49.922 --> 04:52.922
 Snap decisions based on looks
 alone are shallow and shameful.

04:54.360 --> 04:57.360
 But hey, it's all
 in the name of social science.

04:57.630 --> 05:00.565
 JAMIE: It's set up so that
 it's sort of a gut reaction.

05:00.566 --> 05:03.101
 I don't know how consistent
 it's gonna be,

05:03.102 --> 05:06.102
 but that's where the averaging
 becomes important.

05:06.172 --> 05:09.172
 'Cause you've got some kind of a
 number that should show a trend.

05:10.376 --> 05:12.511
 NARRATOR:
 And Jamie's trendy number?

05:12.512 --> 05:15.512
 Higher than Adam's,
 but lower than Kari's.

05:15.615 --> 05:18.615
 JAMIE:
 So I got a 116.

05:19.952 --> 05:21.286
 Whatever that means.

05:21.287 --> 05:22.688

 Well, it means nothing

05:22.689 --> 05:24.690
 till they've done this
 twice more --

 then stumbling, dribbling drunk.

 NARRATOR:
 The aim here is to get buzzed.

05:39.138 --> 05:42.138
 For the boys, that means
 two or three quick brewskies.

05:42.275 --> 05:44.876
 For Kari, maybe one less.

 What's red and smells
 like blue -- blue paint?

 proves she's too drunk to drive.

06:18.978 --> 06:19.978
 [ Exhales deeply ]

06:19.979 --> 06:22.979
 NARRATOR: Then Jamie blows
 the same number as Adam.

06:23.282 --> 06:25.550
 ADAM: .06.

06:25.551 --> 06:28.320
 NARRATOR: But will their
 slightly pickled perceptions

06:28.321 --> 06:31.321
 affect the way they judge
 the opposite sex?

06:31.391 --> 06:34.025
 How am I gonna do
 when I'm buzzed?

06:34.026 --> 06:36.495
 I don't think it will be a whole
 lot different than sober.

06:36.496 --> 06:39.496
 NARRATOR: Adam's not so sure,
 and he's the first to try it.

06:40.566 --> 06:42.601
 I'm at a .06.

06:42.602 --> 06:44.803

 -KARI: No problem.

 Okay. "Adam Buzzed."

06:48.541 --> 06:51.410
 Here we... go.

 NARRATOR: This time around,
 they've got 30 new faces,

06:54.113 --> 06:57.113
 judged by others
 to be exactly as attractive

06:57.283 --> 06:58.950
 as the first batch.

06:58.951 --> 07:01.951
 ADAM: I can already
 feel my ratings being higher.

07:02.155 --> 07:03.855
 [ Laughs ]

07:03.856 --> 07:06.856
 I found it much easier
 to rate them buzzed than sober.

07:08.161 --> 07:11.161
 I started to feel bad
 for the 1 s and 2s while sober.

07:12.198 --> 07:13.832
 Buzzed, didn't care at all.

07:13.833 --> 07:15.834
 1! 1! 2!
 You're out!

07:15.835 --> 07:18.835
 NARRATOR: Harsh words.
 But his tally supports the myth.

07:19.238 --> 07:22.238
 He is finding these faces
 more attractive.

07:22.909 --> 07:25.909
 My buzzed score overall was 121.

07:27.313 --> 07:30.313
 NARRATOR: That's 25 more
 than his sober test.

07:30.583 --> 07:33.583
 So, on average, each girl rates
 almost a full point extra.

07:34.654 --> 07:37.654
 Now for Kari, who was far kinder
 than the boys first time 'round.

07:40.526 --> 07:42.494
 KARI: I think I get a little
 giddy after a few drinks,

07:42.495 --> 07:44.362
 so I think I might be
 pretty generous

07:44.363 --> 07:45.664
 after I've had a beer or two.

07:45.665 --> 07:47.466
 NARRATOR: Or three.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.467
 Kari also has 30 new faces
 to rate.

 But the beer-goggle effect

07:58.711 --> 08:01.112
 seems to be working in reverse.

08:01.113 --> 08:03.281
 KARI: Is this an uglier group
 of people?

08:03.282 --> 08:05.150
 I wouldn't give
 most of those guys change

08:05.151 --> 08:07.118

 Kari rated a similar group
 at 154.

 KARI:
 My buzzed score was 89.

08:17.697 --> 08:19.764
 I might be a mean drunk.

08:19.765 --> 08:22.000
 I'm not sure
 if I was charity rating before,

08:22.001 --> 08:24.469
 'cause I felt kind of bad
 for some of the uglier people.

08:24.470 --> 08:27.470

 no talent in this group.

08:28.608 --> 08:30.208

 to rate the new babes.

 And remember, he predicted
 no change whatsoever.

08:43.389 --> 08:46.389
 My perceptions of what made them
 attractive or not attractive

08:47.727 --> 08:49.728
 were pretty much the same

08:49.729 --> 08:51.429
 as they were the last time,
 as far as I know.

08:51.430 --> 08:54.430

 features, signs of health --

08:56.168 --> 08:57.636

 Jamie's brain
 is lightly sautÃƒÂ©ed.

09:02.108 --> 09:05.108

09:06.979 --> 09:09.979
 My buzzed score was 105.

 But we're yet to test anyone
 cross-eyed drunk.

09:16.656 --> 09:19.656
 And when we do, the figures,
 I promise, will surprise you.

09:21.193 --> 09:24.193
 I feel like I've met her.

09:26.933 --> 09:29.933
 All right, you guys. This
 next myth is gonna be insane.

 -What is it?
 -That's it -- the hwacha.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.773
 -lt's an ancient Korean weapon.
 -Oh.

 that means it's not a myth.

 -lt exists.
 -GRANT: Well, we know it exists.

 What we're gonna test
 is the legend of the hwacha,

09:40.313 --> 09:42.514
 whether or not it could do
 what they said it could do.

09:42.515 --> 09:45.250
 Apparently, they could fire
 200 arrows all at once

09:45.251 --> 09:48.251
 going 500 yards and all
 of the arrows explode on impact.

09:48.754 --> 09:51.590
 Okay, well, to begin with,
 any weapon in that era

09:51.591 --> 09:53.592
 wouldn't have had the benefit
 of modern explosives

09:53.593 --> 09:54.559
 or propellants.

09:54.560 --> 09:57.362
 It was likely based
 entirely on black powder.

09:57.363 --> 09:58.930
 So first, we need to find out
 if black powder

09:58.931 --> 10:01.132
 can actually propel
 one of those arrows 500 yards.

10:01.133 --> 10:03.435
 Right, and then we need to see
 if we can get these rockets

10:03.436 --> 10:04.936
 to explode on impact.

10:04.937 --> 10:06.471
 And finally, we need to see

10:06.472 --> 10:09.207
 if we can launch
 200 arrows simultaneously

10:09.208 --> 10:11.076
 without them all crashing
 into each other

10:11.077 --> 10:13.111
 or exploding on the stand.

10:13.112 --> 10:16.112
 NARRATOR: It's a massive myth to
 unravel, with three key parts.

10:17.416 --> 10:20.416
 One, can a fire arrow
 actually travel 500 yards?

10:22.188 --> 10:25.188
 Two, can it be rigged
 to explode on impact?

10:25.224 --> 10:26.224
 [ Gasps ]

10:26.225 --> 10:29.225
 NARRATOR: And three, can you
 really set off 200 at once?

10:30.830 --> 10:33.131
 So let's start
 up at the pointy end.

10:33.132 --> 10:35.834
 What I'm gonna do now is I'm
 gonna build one of these arrows

10:35.835 --> 10:38.835
 from the materials that the
 ancient Koreans would have used.

10:39.271 --> 10:40.905
 I have some bamboo,

10:40.906 --> 10:43.274
 I have some feathers
 for my fletching

10:43.275 --> 10:46.275
 and, finally, a piece of steel
 to make my arrowheads out of.

10:48.614 --> 10:51.614
 NARRATOR: Tory proves himself
 a first-class fletcher...

10:53.119 --> 10:56.119
...and a pretty fair blacksmith.

10:57.823 --> 10:59.491
 All right.
 So my arrow's done.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.693
 Now it's time to see
 how it flies.

11:01.694 --> 11:04.694
 Hwacha!

11:05.731 --> 11:08.066
 Pretty dang good.

11:08.067 --> 11:11.067
 NARRATOR:
 That's one down, 199 to go.

11:12.605 --> 11:15.173
 Tory leaves the hard work
 to Kari,

11:15.174 --> 11:17.308
 as he and Grant skip town

11:17.309 --> 11:20.309
 to visit Zambelli Fireworks
 in Pennsylvania.

11:20.446 --> 11:21.813
 TORY:
 We're lost, aren't we?

11:21.814 --> 11:24.215
 NARRATOR: The rationale
 behind the road trip

11:24.216 --> 11:27.216
 is that the fire arrows work
 just like skyrockets.

11:27.853 --> 11:30.055
 TORY: Now, if we happen to have
 some fun while we're here,

11:30.056 --> 11:33.056
 that's purely coincidental.

11:34.026 --> 11:35.660
 NARRATOR:
 Just like fireworks,

11:35.661 --> 11:38.661
 the hwacha rockets
 were charged with black powder.

11:38.964 --> 11:41.964
 Ours have to travel 500 yards
 strapped to a 4 1/2-foot arrow.

11:44.870 --> 11:47.870
 Grant and Tory are determined
 to roll their own,

11:48.007 --> 11:49.974
 and Bill is here to help them.

11:49.975 --> 11:52.975
 Well, let's see.
 What's one of these weigh?

11:53.546 --> 11:55.513
 Well, about 4 ounces.

11:55.514 --> 11:57.782
 Every 12 ounces
 the shell weighs,

11:57.783 --> 12:00.051
 we add one ounce of lift
 to lift it up in the air.

12:00.052 --> 12:03.052
 If you guys want to go
 500 yards, that's a long way.

12:04.256 --> 12:07.158
 So we'll see
 how a 2-ounce rocket works.

12:07.159 --> 12:09.661
 NARRATOR:
 Using six-inch cardboard tubes,

12:09.662 --> 12:12.662
 Bill shows how to pack a charge
 without blowing up the bunker.

12:13.632 --> 12:15.500
 GRANT: And so you do
 a little bit at a time,

12:15.501 --> 12:17.869
 -and you compress that.
 -BILL: You put the rod down in,

12:17.870 --> 12:19.637
 and you just give it
 a couple hits.

12:19.638 --> 12:21.339
 -Feels wrong.
 -Go ahead.

12:21.340 --> 12:23.141
 Don't hit it too hard, man.

12:23.142 --> 12:26.142
 I'd hate to see you
 blow your hand off.

12:27.079 --> 12:30.079
 -Good?
 -GRANT: Nice.

12:32.118 --> 12:34.753
 NARRATOR: Grant and Tory make
 several versions,

12:34.754 --> 12:37.754
 some with more black powder
 and some with less.

12:38.290 --> 12:40.925
 All right. We need to see if
 these arrows can fly 500 yards.

12:40.926 --> 12:42.594
 So we should walk it out.

12:42.595 --> 12:45.230
 NARRATOR: They're here to test
 part 1 of the myth --

12:45.231 --> 12:48.231
 that a rocket arrow
 really could make the distance.

12:48.234 --> 12:51.234
 But 500 yards is a long,
 long way.

12:52.071 --> 12:54.372
 TORY: Isn't this how
 all horror movies start?

12:54.373 --> 12:55.640
 [ Laughs ]

12:55.641 --> 12:58.641
 "Didn't that guy say
 stick to the path?"

12:59.812 --> 13:02.812
 This is gonna be perfect.
 We're right at the tree line.

13:02.915 --> 13:05.915
 NARRATOR: The crop ends
 smack-bang on the 500-yard mark.

13:09.021 --> 13:11.556
 They tape the target
 halfway up a tree

13:11.557 --> 13:13.958
 so they can see it
 from the launch site.

13:13.959 --> 13:15.126
 GRANT:
 At this point,

13:15.127 --> 13:18.127
 I think we're just going
 for distance rather than aim.

13:18.764 --> 13:20.532
 But if I were to take a guess

13:20.533 --> 13:22.667
 to see whether the arrow
 would hit him,

13:22.668 --> 13:24.836
 I'd have to say
 we probably wouldn't.

13:24.837 --> 13:27.837
 Then again,
 the hwacha had 200 arrows.

13:28.274 --> 13:29.741
 NARRATOR:
 Back at the business end,

13:29.742 --> 13:32.310
 they set the mortar
 to 45 degrees...

13:32.311 --> 13:33.311
 GRANT:
 Back up.

13:33.312 --> 13:35.713
 NARRATOR:... and start
 with the smallest rocket.

13:35.714 --> 13:38.714
 If this baby-bear rocket
 reaches the trees,

13:39.318 --> 13:42.318
 they can pack up and go home.

13:46.992 --> 13:48.660
 -GRANT: Yeah!
 -TORY: Nice!

13:48.661 --> 13:49.861
 It didn't really work!

13:49.862 --> 13:52.862
 I'm gonna have to say
 it went about zero yards.

13:52.898 --> 13:55.898
 -GRANT: Not enough thrust.
 -TORY: Yes.

13:57.236 --> 13:58.570
 It does look
 a little embarrassing

13:58.571 --> 14:00.839
 that this is our first rocket
 that we built

14:00.840 --> 14:02.207
 and it doesn't even fly.

14:02.208 --> 14:04.375
 But that just means
 this rocket's too small

14:04.376 --> 14:07.376
 and the arrow's too heavy.

14:08.347 --> 14:11.347
 NARRATOR: So they try
 the mama-bear charge.

14:11.951 --> 14:13.585
 GRANT:
 Back up.

14:13.586 --> 14:16.586
 NARRATOR: But it still
 more blows than goes.

14:18.057 --> 14:19.057
 GRANT: Cool!

14:19.058 --> 14:21.492
 There's a lot of reasons
 why these might not be working.

14:21.493 --> 14:24.195
 Maybe we didn't pack
 the black powder tight enough.

14:24.196 --> 14:25.997
 The nozzle might be
 the wrong size

14:25.998 --> 14:27.332
 or the arrows
 are just too heavy,

14:27.333 --> 14:29.601
 and this rocket
 can't give it lift.

14:29.602 --> 14:32.602
 But we're not gonna give up.

14:33.372 --> 14:36.341
 NARRATOR: So Grant tries
 a rocket with more powder

14:36.342 --> 14:38.509
 and a smaller nozzle.

14:38.510 --> 14:41.510
 TORY: Quick!
 They're charging!

14:43.649 --> 14:45.483
 Whoa-ho-ho!

14:45.484 --> 14:47.018
 [ Both laugh ]

14:47.019 --> 14:49.020
 Nice!
 That was nuts!

14:49.021 --> 14:52.021
 [ Laughs ] Did you see it go,
 spiral around?

14:52.758 --> 14:55.193
 TORY: All right. I'm gonna see
 if I can go find that.

14:55.194 --> 14:58.194
 -GRANT: Good luck.
 -TORY: Wow!

15:02.334 --> 15:05.069
 Grant! Whoo!

15:05.070 --> 15:07.639
 That went more than halfway.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.407
 GRANT:
 Yeah -- 290 yards.

15:09.408 --> 15:10.975
 TORY:
 As beautiful as that was,

15:10.976 --> 15:12.443
 it's still not good enough
 for this myth.

15:12.444 --> 15:15.280
 I mean, the arrow
 only made it to 290 yards.

15:15.281 --> 15:17.815
 We're not stopping
 until we reach 500.

15:17.816 --> 15:20.018
 NARRATOR: For that, they'll
 need to double the charge

15:20.019 --> 15:23.019
 by strapping on
 two black-powder engines.

15:23.155 --> 15:25.189
 But will the arrow bear
 the weight?

15:25.190 --> 15:28.190
 Grant adjusts the angle
 to 50 degrees.

15:28.560 --> 15:31.560
 That is right on the money.

15:31.597 --> 15:34.432
 NARRATOR: This field test
 is all about going the distance.

15:34.433 --> 15:37.433
 Landing short
 would make this myth a misfire.

15:38.604 --> 15:41.604
 GRANT: Come on, baby.
 Come on, hwacha.

15:43.475 --> 15:45.810
 Come on! Come on!

15:47.846 --> 15:49.814

 Keep going!

15:49.815 --> 15:51.282
 -Yeah!
 -GRANT: Oh!

15:51.283 --> 15:53.251
 That looked like it exploded
 above the trees.

15:53.252 --> 15:55.987
 Yes! I think it exploded
 over the trees, man.

15:55.988 --> 15:58.456
 -That's 500 yards, buddy.
 -That went the distance!

15:58.457 --> 16:01.457
 Yeah!

16:02.761 --> 16:04.862
 NARRATOR:
 The target's untouched,

16:04.863 --> 16:07.131
 but they've got
 what they came for.

16:07.132 --> 16:08.800
 They reached it.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.401
 This part of the myth
 is confirmed.

16:10.402 --> 16:12.036
 God, this is gonna be
 a nightmare

16:12.037 --> 16:15.037
 trying to get all 200 arrows
 to fire off at the same time.

16:15.074 --> 16:16.674
 And we've still
 got to make the cart

16:16.675 --> 16:19.310
 and find out if that explosive
 charge is mortally wounding.

16:19.311 --> 16:22.246
 We got a lot of work. We'd
 better get back to the shop.

16:22.247 --> 16:24.449
 All right.

16:24.450 --> 16:27.218
 NARRATOR: Adam, Jamie, and Kari
 are risking their lives --

16:27.219 --> 16:28.920
 uh, that should read "livers" --

16:28.921 --> 16:30.788
 to test the myth
 of beer goggles.

 This is
 the best day at work ever.

16:33.359 --> 16:34.692
 [ Laughs ]

16:34.693 --> 16:37.693
 NARRATOR: They've all done
 the test sober and then buzzed

16:37.796 --> 16:40.631
 with varied results.

16:40.632 --> 16:42.734
 Time to raise the stakes...

16:42.735 --> 16:44.502
 I think it's time for a Scotch.

16:44.503 --> 16:47.005
 NARRATOR:... and maybe lower
 their standards.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.573
 What are you gonna have?

16:48.574 --> 16:50.174
 Whatever's in that brown bottle.

16:50.175 --> 16:53.175
 NARRATOR: Hard to beat
 a drink of something... brown.

16:55.147 --> 16:57.248
 Kari still has a lot to learn,

16:57.249 --> 17:00.218
 like, "Don't tease
 the wildlife."

17:00.219 --> 17:03.219
 Can I style you?
 Hold on.

17:04.455 --> 17:06.991
 You know, I usually
 don't let people do that.

17:06.992 --> 17:08.226
 ADAM:
 I don't know about you, Jamie,

17:08.227 --> 17:11.227
 but I'm ready to take this test,
 and I know that Kari is.

 for this test.

 they're all well primed

17:33.385 --> 17:36.187
 for part three
 of the beer-goggles challenge.

17:36.188 --> 17:39.188
 These last 30 faces
 are a random mix

17:39.358 --> 17:42.226
 of those they've seen sober
 and buzzed.

 She's very cute.

17:48.100 --> 17:50.835
 I've met her.

17:50.836 --> 17:53.836
 It seems like in each group,
 there's a lot more cute chicks.

17:55.774 --> 17:57.608
 NARRATOR:
 When he's done, Adam's score

17:57.609 --> 18:00.111
 reflects his growing enthusiasm.

18:00.112 --> 18:03.112

18:03.115 --> 18:05.516
 Wow.

18:05.517 --> 18:08.517
 NARRATOR:
 But the wild card here is Kari.

18:08.554 --> 18:11.554
 She was far harsher buzzed,
 so this could be anything.

18:12.891 --> 18:15.126
 "Kari Drunk."

18:15.127 --> 18:16.327
 NARRATOR:
 Kari correct.

18:16.328 --> 18:19.328
 Her 30 guys look set
 for another beating,

18:19.665 --> 18:21.833
 assuming she can
 still see straight.

18:21.834 --> 18:24.834
 You look homeless
 but kind of cute.

18:25.437 --> 18:27.305
 He's all right.

18:27.306 --> 18:30.306
 NARRATOR: Even Kari's surprised
 that the tide might be turning.

18:31.143 --> 18:33.878
 KARI: When I was sober,
 I was definitely thinking

18:33.879 --> 18:36.879
 that confident-looking people
 looked sort of attractive.

18:38.016 --> 18:41.016
 And then as I was buzzed,
 they looked cocky.

18:41.253 --> 18:44.253
 And then as I got drunker,
 I was sort of thinking

18:45.624 --> 18:47.258
 that the people
 that were attractive

18:47.259 --> 18:49.560
 were sort of the more
 vulnerable-looking people,

18:49.561 --> 18:51.696
 sort of like
 the more sadder characters.

18:51.697 --> 18:53.498
 They just -- They looked cuter.

18:53.499 --> 18:56.234
 NARRATOR: And that's why
 men will never, ever guess

18:56.235 --> 18:58.302
 what a woman is thinking.

18:58.303 --> 19:00.938
 Kari's score is 153.

19:00.939 --> 19:02.740
 I can't remember

19:02.741 --> 19:05.741
 if that's higher or lower
 than either of my scores.

19:06.445 --> 19:09.445
 NARRATOR: That's a 64-point jump
 from last time.

19:09.748 --> 19:12.748
 As for the man bent on putting
 reason back into romance...

19:14.753 --> 19:17.753

 Start.

19:18.290 --> 19:21.290

 and an orange is an orange.

 -[ Ding! ]
 -Drunk score, 111.

19:31.103 --> 19:34.103
 NARRATOR: From stone-cold sober
 to stinking drunk,

19:35.073 --> 19:38.073
 Jamie's judgment varied
 by just 11 points.

19:39.478 --> 19:41.045
 Basically, what I'm saying

19:41.046 --> 19:44.046
 is that I don't see that
 I'm subject to beer goggles.

19:45.250 --> 19:47.818
 NARRATOR: With three
 very different results,

19:47.819 --> 19:50.819
 they'll make or break this myth
 by checking the numbers.

19:51.490 --> 19:52.924
 I don't know about
 you two reprobates,

19:52.925 --> 19:55.126
 but I don't feel in any
 condition to crunch any numbers.

19:55.127 --> 19:58.127
 I think we ought to go home,
 drink a lot of water,

19:58.697 --> 20:00.398

 and come back tomorrow.

20:00.399 --> 20:02.567
 Did you say
 you were calling a taxi?

20:02.568 --> 20:04.402
 Taxi.
 Absolutely.

20:04.403 --> 20:06.237
 Looks to me like we all had

20:06.238 --> 20:08.306
 very different reactions
 to the alcohol.

20:08.307 --> 20:09.774
 What do you two make out of it?

20:09.775 --> 20:11.342
 I'll tell you what I see.

20:11.343 --> 20:13.044
 If this myth
 were totally confirmed,

20:13.045 --> 20:15.246
 all three of our graph lines
 would look like mine --

20:15.247 --> 20:17.181
 a steady improvement

20:17.182 --> 20:18.916
 in our assessment
 of the attractiveness

20:18.917 --> 20:20.885
 of the opposite sex,
 directly in proportion

20:20.886 --> 20:23.154
 to the amount of alcohol
 we consumed.

20:23.155 --> 20:24.689
 It definitely looks like
 I was way harsher

20:24.690 --> 20:26.657
 when I was buzzed
 than when I was sober.

20:26.658 --> 20:28.292
 And I look pretty consistent,
 all in all.

20:28.293 --> 20:30.094
 However, I'd like to point out
 that both of you

20:30.095 --> 20:33.095
 showed improvement from
 being buzzed to being drunk.

20:33.732 --> 20:34.699
 That result,

20:34.700 --> 20:37.201
 combined with my steady
 improvement all along the line,

20:37.202 --> 20:39.637

 is easily plausible.

 Definitely plausible.

 Okay.
 Plausible.

 NARRATOR:
 Adam and Jamie have already

20:51.483 --> 20:53.851
 drunk themselves sideways
 for science,

20:53.852 --> 20:56.852
 but there's no time
 to sleep it off.

20:56.989 --> 20:59.989
 In fact, that's exactly
 the point of our next myth.

21:00.559 --> 21:03.559
 Well, I've been thinking, along
 the lines of drinking myths,

21:04.663 --> 21:07.663
 I have always wanted to do
 sobering-up techniques,

21:07.966 --> 21:10.434
 specifically 'cause
 I've always wanted to see

21:10.435 --> 21:13.435
 a high-speed shot of somebody
 getting smacked in the face.

21:14.740 --> 21:17.740
 Well, as long as that somebody
 is you, I'm okay with it.

21:19.878 --> 21:21.545
 ADAM: Almost since
 the invention of alcohol,

21:21.546 --> 21:22.913
 people have been drinking
 too much

21:22.914 --> 21:24.882
 and then finding,
 for one reason or another,

21:24.883 --> 21:27.585
 that they needed
 to get sober quickly.

21:27.586 --> 21:30.388
 And they have tried
 a myriad of techniques --

21:30.389 --> 21:33.389
 techniques like drinking
 a big cup of black coffee.

21:34.893 --> 21:37.893
 Vigorous exercise
 is also supposed to work.

21:39.331 --> 21:42.331
 Dunking your face
 in some ice water.

21:43.068 --> 21:45.536
 That's also supposed to work!

21:45.537 --> 21:48.537
 Also, your friends
 might be inclined to...

21:50.242 --> 21:52.276
...smack you in the face
 to sober you up.

21:52.277 --> 21:54.679
 Of course,
 it all begins at the bar.

 And although we're gonna test
 every one of these,

 Realizing that things
 might turn ugly,

 to prerecord the plan.

22:23.241 --> 22:25.976
 [ Coughing ]

22:25.977 --> 22:28.145
 Because this whole story hinges
 on whether or not

22:28.146 --> 22:30.948
 we are more or less sober,
 the researchers have found us

22:30.949 --> 22:32.950
 the perfect test
 to determine that.

22:32.951 --> 22:34.852
 This is a hand-eye
 coordination test

22:34.853 --> 22:37.822
 that's very similar
 to one developed for astronauts.

22:37.823 --> 22:40.823
 It simply involves staying
 at arm's length from the screen

22:41.193 --> 22:44.193
 with weights on your arm
 and tracing this gray line.

22:44.763 --> 22:47.198
 We are scored
 on both accuracy --

22:47.199 --> 22:49.900
 how many times
 our line leaves the gray line

22:49.901 --> 22:51.769
 and for how long and speed --

22:51.770 --> 22:53.604
 how long it takes
 to make the whole journey.

22:53.605 --> 22:55.005
 We've got a number of these.

22:55.006 --> 22:57.341
 They're all different,
 but they're all the same length

22:57.342 --> 23:00.010
 and involve
 the same number of turns.

 one of these tests

23:02.347 --> 23:04.281

23:41.453 --> 23:43.954
 the first part
 of the hwacha myth.

23:43.955 --> 23:46.955
 A bamboo arrow with a gunpowder
 engine can fly 500 yards.

23:49.861 --> 23:51.162
 Part 2 of the test

23:51.163 --> 23:54.131
 is to see if the arrows
 were double-deadly --

23:54.132 --> 23:56.901
 A warhead filled
 with more gunpowder

23:56.902 --> 23:59.203
 was meant to explode on impact.

23:59.204 --> 24:02.204
 But will it do more
 than just singe the skin?

 All right.

24:39.611 --> 24:41.912
 But as far as making it
 a mortal wound

24:41.913 --> 24:43.647
 that explodes inside you...

24:43.648 --> 24:44.682
 Yeah, the arrow itself

24:44.683 --> 24:47.683
 is probably gonna do more damage
 than the explosion.

24:49.688 --> 24:52.056
 NARRATOR: But we're testing
 for deadly injury,

24:52.057 --> 24:54.091
 so it's worth
 rewrapping the warhead

24:54.092 --> 24:57.092
 to push all that explosive
 energy forwards.

 of least resistance.

 That's a little more
 what you were looking for.

25:25.991 --> 25:28.991
 NARRATOR: And exactly
 what they were hoping for.

25:30.228 --> 25:33.228
 This is the same amount of black
 powder as the test before.

25:33.965 --> 25:36.767
 The only difference
 is how we contained it.

25:36.768 --> 25:38.736
 Now, before,
 we had a thin paper tube.

25:38.737 --> 25:41.737
 The tube blew out, and all
 the energy was being released.

25:42.674 --> 25:45.674
 In this test, we sealed
 both ends of the container

25:46.411 --> 25:48.345
 and had a small fuse going in.

25:48.346 --> 25:50.347

 that was being lost

 serious additional damage

 whether 200 arrows

26:32.123 --> 26:33.958
 Since Tory told us
 about the hwacha,

26:33.959 --> 26:35.626
 I've been doing a little bit
 of research about it.

26:35.627 --> 26:38.062
 It turns out that the first one
 was made in 1409

26:38.063 --> 26:40.397
 during the Choson Dynasty
 by Korean scientists.

26:40.398 --> 26:42.232
 But they say
 that one wasn't used in combat.

26:42.233 --> 26:45.233
 Yeah, and by 1503, it had become
 such an effective weapon

26:45.804 --> 26:47.371
 that in the Battle of Haengju,

 3,000 Korean soldiers
 and 40 hwachas

26:50.241 --> 26:53.043
 repelled over 30,000
 Japanese troops.

 So they were outnumbered
 10 to 1.

26:54.913 --> 26:55.879
 Yeah.

26:55.880 --> 26:56.981
 In fact, at that time,

 the hwacha had become
 a primary defensive strategy.

 with them.

 TORY: That's incredible.

40:17.481 --> 40:19.249
 Like, they were
 pretty consistent.

40:19.250 --> 40:20.884
 KARI: Oh, there are definitely
 army over here.

40:20.885 --> 40:22.085
 We only had 50 soldiers.

40:22.086 --> 40:25.086
 Imagine if we had like
 3,000, 30,000, 300,000.

40:27.825 --> 40:28.892
 NARRATOR:
 Kari's right.

40:28.893 --> 40:31.893
 The troops wouldn't be so few
 or so scattered.

40:32.196 --> 40:35.196
 So this rocket attack
 would be devastating.

40:36.867 --> 40:39.836
 All right.
 So, hwacha -- confirmed?

40:39.837 --> 40:42.837
 Confirmed.
 They all left and they exploded.

40:42.840 --> 40:44.340
 Absolutely confirmed.

40:44.341 --> 40:46.776
 -All right.
 -That was a good one, man.

40:46.777 --> 40:49.777
 [ Hawk screeches ]

40:53.184 --> 40:54.951
 KARI: The hwacha worked
 on many levels.

40:54.952 --> 40:57.520
 But most of all,
 it was frightening.

40:57.521 --> 41:00.521
 All of those arrows
 flying into the air on fire

41:00.658 --> 41:03.658
 and exploding would definitely
 make me turn around and run.

41:06.630 --> 41:08.198
 TORY:
 That was a success.

41:08.199 --> 41:10.667
 I mean, we got all the arrows
 to fire off except for one,

41:10.668 --> 41:12.969
 and they all went the distance
 and they all exploded.

41:12.970 --> 41:14.804
 Okay, maybe we didn't
 take out the army.

41:14.805 --> 41:16.606
 That's just because
 our aim was off.

41:16.607 --> 41:19.607
 But if we had been aimed right,
 we would have killed this army!

41:20.244 --> 41:21.644
 NARRATOR:
 We knew it existed,

41:21.645 --> 41:24.645
 but no one knew for sure
 what the hwacha was capable of.
