WEBVTT

00:08.383 --> 00:12.220
[dramatic orchestral music playing]

00:28.987 --> 00:31.614
[Viktor panting]
Let's never do that again.

00:31.698 --> 00:34.784
-What, narrowly escape the apocalypse?
-It's kind of our thing, isn't it?

00:34.868 --> 00:37.037
There's something very wrong about that.

00:37.120 --> 00:39.831
-[Lila] Same suite, just ass-backward.
-No hyperbole there.

00:39.914 --> 00:42.083
This is some hardcore
Alice in Wonderland shit.

00:42.167 --> 00:44.419
-Yeah, it only gets weirder.
-[Reginald panting]

00:47.505 --> 00:49.674
[out of breath] At last, the other side.

00:49.758 --> 00:53.386
-Wait. Where's Klaus?
-Children, I'm sorry, but your brother…

00:53.470 --> 00:56.347
I did all I could,
but he didn't make it through in time.

00:57.098 --> 00:58.850
The Kugelblitz
has claimed its last victim.

00:58.933 --> 01:01.895
No, he was right behind me
when I entered the tunnel.

01:01.978 --> 01:03.063
We need to go back.

01:03.146 --> 01:04.689
There's nothing to go back to.

01:04.773 --> 01:06.566
Children, there will be time
for tears later.

01:06.649 --> 01:08.359
Right now, we have to keep moving.

01:09.861 --> 01:11.905
Wait. Luther and Klaus?

01:16.284 --> 01:18.036
When we say reality,

01:18.620 --> 01:20.205
what do we really mean?

01:20.997 --> 01:23.792
In the 1800s, the best minds of the age

01:23.875 --> 01:27.045
theorized we live in a clockwork cosmos.

01:27.545 --> 01:33.218
In the Quantum Age, time and space
are suspected to be a holograph.

01:34.177 --> 01:36.096
Ancient people believed

01:36.179 --> 01:38.932
we rode on the back of four flying turtles

01:39.015 --> 01:41.810
or on the horns of a white buffalo.

01:42.811 --> 01:45.980
These ideas beg the question,

01:46.773 --> 01:48.191
will we ever know

01:48.858 --> 01:50.693
the shape of reality?

01:51.528 --> 01:55.615
Or, odder still, does it have a shape
other than the one we give it?

01:55.698 --> 01:56.699
[Luther] Wow!

01:57.200 --> 01:58.451
Makes you feel tiny, huh?

01:58.535 --> 02:00.995
Why would you put pineapple on a pizza?

02:01.871 --> 02:04.374
You know, when you think about it,

02:05.708 --> 02:06.709
we are just

02:07.877 --> 02:09.712
tiny specks of sand

02:10.672 --> 02:12.340
in a desert full of other sand.

02:12.423 --> 02:15.218
I mean, it's a garnish
for cocktails, at best.

02:15.301 --> 02:17.428
And that's inside solar systems.

02:18.054 --> 02:21.099
Inside deserts of galaxies.

02:21.182 --> 02:23.852
I guess the real question to ask is,
why is it on my pizza?

02:23.935 --> 02:25.937
-Klaus, are you listening?
-Yeah, sure.

02:26.020 --> 02:28.439
We're insignificant in all things,
blah, blah, blah.

02:28.523 --> 02:32.235
Sorry I'm not a stoned undergrad
sitting in freshman philosophy.

02:33.361 --> 02:34.362
Wait a second.

02:36.614 --> 02:38.825
-Where exactly are we?
-We're dead, man.

02:40.243 --> 02:41.161
We're dead.

02:42.120 --> 02:44.080
Welcome to my hood.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.875
-[bicycle bell chiming]
-[gentle string music playing]

02:54.924 --> 02:56.301
[bell dings]

03:04.017 --> 03:05.310
It's magnificent.

03:05.977 --> 03:08.479
[Ben] You guys should've stayed here.
This place is way nicer.

03:08.563 --> 03:11.232
Lila and I barely got out alive last time.
Remember?

03:11.316 --> 03:13.610
But I'm here this time,
and the numbers are in our favor.

03:13.693 --> 03:16.237
Well, whatever it was,
it was strong, fast, and super pissed.

03:16.321 --> 03:19.115
Alright, so, whatever you do,
do not ring this bell.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.201
Unless you wanna
lose a finger or a tentacle.

03:21.910 --> 03:22.911
I'll take my chances--

03:22.994 --> 03:24.621
-Don't!
-Get out of my way.

03:24.704 --> 03:27.415
To take out this thing,
we need to be in the right state of mind.

03:27.498 --> 03:29.834
[Sloane] State of mind?
Do you mean, am I angry?

03:29.918 --> 03:31.044
Yes, I am angry.

03:31.127 --> 03:33.213
I wanna kill
whatever it is that hurt Luther.

03:33.296 --> 03:35.548
[Viktor] Luther isn't
the only one that's gone.

03:35.632 --> 03:37.467
We lost Klaus too.

03:37.550 --> 03:40.011
[Viktor] I'm angry, okay? We all are.

03:40.094 --> 03:41.512
We have to be smart about this.

03:41.596 --> 03:43.848
[Lila] Yeah.
When the time is right, we'll act.

03:43.932 --> 03:46.351
[Diego] Don't even try it, Five.
Doors won't let you out.

03:46.434 --> 03:48.394
[Allison] So, what, we're stuck here?

03:48.478 --> 03:52.523
This place is a test and a trap
and a means of salvation, all at once.

03:52.607 --> 03:56.110
-Does anyone know what that sign says?
-Yeah, it says "Do not ring the bell."

03:56.194 --> 03:59.697
-That's what that means.
-We get it, Diego. Bell bad.

04:00.448 --> 04:01.282
What do we do?

04:02.116 --> 04:03.451
[Five] Does anybody know?

04:04.118 --> 04:05.161
Reggie?

04:05.912 --> 04:06.788
Reggie.

04:06.871 --> 04:09.290
[pages flipping]

04:09.374 --> 04:12.752
I'm hungry.
Does anyone fancy an unagi roll?

04:12.835 --> 04:14.963
How can you possibly eat
at a time like this?

04:15.046 --> 04:17.548
I don't know.
How can you be a dick at a time like this?

04:17.632 --> 04:18.716
-Hey!
-Oh, you'll--

04:19.217 --> 04:20.677
Back off, all right?

04:21.594 --> 04:23.096
-She's eating for--
-Strength.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.473
In these trying times.

04:27.475 --> 04:29.394
Diego, can you come with me for a second?

04:31.396 --> 04:32.814
[Luther] I… I'm dead?

04:32.897 --> 04:36.109
[Klaus] Yeah, and I'm so glad to be here
for your first time

04:36.192 --> 04:37.610
'cause it's kind of a weird feeling.

04:37.694 --> 04:40.697
It's like waking up
from a really vivid dream.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.115
But don't worry.

04:42.615 --> 04:45.285
Because it's all gonna
make sense really soon.

04:45.368 --> 04:47.745
[quietly] Oh my God. Dad killed me.

04:47.829 --> 04:50.498
Oh my God! He killed me too! A lot.

04:51.791 --> 04:52.709
He's an alien.

04:52.792 --> 04:55.962
We're trying not to use
that kinda terminology here.

04:56.045 --> 04:58.131
And I know, it's whoa PC,

04:58.214 --> 05:00.633
but you could just say he's

05:01.384 --> 05:02.218
British.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.429
No, no! I mean, he's a real alien.

05:04.512 --> 05:07.598
He's like a… bug person
from another planet.

05:07.682 --> 05:09.100
Oh God. Klaus…

05:10.018 --> 05:12.437
You gotta go back
and warn Sloane and the others.

05:12.520 --> 05:14.856
Non posso.
I mean, I'm done with the other side.

05:14.939 --> 05:16.858
-Excuse me?
-Yeah, I belong here.

05:16.941 --> 05:20.403
All my "life,"
I've been a loser, I've been a freak,

05:20.486 --> 05:24.449
I've made mistake
after mistake after mistake,

05:24.532 --> 05:26.576
but all of that was a sign, you see.

05:27.201 --> 05:29.537
It was a sign that this is my home.

05:30.413 --> 05:32.081
It's where I'm meant to be.

05:32.582 --> 05:33.499
This shitty place?

05:33.583 --> 05:35.918
Come on! I meant in the ethereal, silly,

05:36.002 --> 05:38.296
with you and all our

05:39.255 --> 05:41.257
ghostly eternal pals.

05:41.966 --> 05:43.426
Where the hell does that leave me?

05:43.509 --> 05:47.930
Eating pizzas and watching
cool documentaries with moi forever.

05:48.014 --> 05:50.516
So wait. You're just gonna
turn your back on our family?

05:50.600 --> 05:52.268
I wouldn't worry about it too much.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.937
They'll be here soon enough.
Everybody dies eventually.

05:55.021 --> 05:56.356
-Am I right?
-Mm.

05:56.939 --> 05:58.441
Yeah, I mean, we're dead, right?

05:58.524 --> 05:59.817
As the Dougie, baby.

05:59.901 --> 06:01.277
-[laughs] As the Dougie!
-Yeah!

06:01.361 --> 06:03.279
So what happens if I do this?

06:03.363 --> 06:04.614
[Klaus grunts]

06:06.240 --> 06:07.784
[groans]

06:07.867 --> 06:10.119
[whimpering]

06:10.203 --> 06:12.455
[laughing]

06:12.538 --> 06:13.706
Nice try, big guy,

06:13.790 --> 06:16.793
but there ain't no pain in the Void.

06:16.876 --> 06:18.461
Yeah! Take your best shot!

06:19.379 --> 06:20.755
Challenge accepted.

06:21.589 --> 06:22.924
[gentle flute music playing]

06:23.007 --> 06:25.176
[Lila] I can't believe
you were just gonna blurt it out.

06:25.259 --> 06:27.845
[Diego] I'm sorry, alright? But maybe
we should tell 'em about the baby.

06:27.929 --> 06:29.097
[Lila, with mouth full] No.

06:29.931 --> 06:32.809
I'd like to get through the mission
before you throw a gender-reveal party.

06:32.892 --> 06:35.728
-Yeah, but imagine--
-Can you pass me the soy sauce, please?

06:37.980 --> 06:38.898
I don't get it.

06:38.981 --> 06:42.402
Like, we're with the people
that love us the most, okay?

06:42.485 --> 06:44.112
So why wouldn't we tell them?

06:44.737 --> 06:47.281
-[Lila murmurs]
-Huh? Things suck right now.

06:47.365 --> 06:51.327
And it would be nice to give the family
something to fight for.

06:52.578 --> 06:54.414
Can you shut up and eat your fish?

06:58.418 --> 07:00.420
Okay. Okay.

07:01.712 --> 07:03.506
[Five] Nah, it's like the old man said.

07:03.589 --> 07:06.759
Once is happenstance,
twice is coincidence,

07:06.843 --> 07:09.846
and three times ain't gonna happen
'cause I'm not a gibbering idiot.

07:09.929 --> 07:11.973
Well, we can't be sure
he killed Klaus or Luther.

07:12.056 --> 07:15.810
You serious? This is his modus operandi.
We've seen this before.

07:15.893 --> 07:19.355
Have you forgotten how
we all came together in the first place?

07:19.439 --> 07:21.482
-Dad's funeral.
-[Five] Exactly.

07:21.566 --> 07:24.569
He pulled this on you rubes before,
and he's doing it again now.

07:24.652 --> 07:25.653
-Come on, Five.
-[Five] No.

07:25.736 --> 07:28.114
He lost the vote
to come through the tunnel,

07:28.197 --> 07:29.490
yet here we are.

07:29.574 --> 07:31.826
Are you really sure
that he could kill Luther?

07:31.909 --> 07:34.370
I think he could kill Luther,
Klaus, and the rest of us

07:34.454 --> 07:36.330
without breaking a moral sweat.

07:36.831 --> 07:39.750
And what's worse,
I think Allison is involved.

07:39.834 --> 07:41.252
No. No. [scoffs]

07:43.212 --> 07:45.381
I hate to say the things everyone says.

07:45.465 --> 07:48.468
Mourning in cliché
is the last thing you need to worry about.

07:50.303 --> 07:53.055
[sniffles] I know everything is ending,

07:54.015 --> 07:57.602
but I thought we'd be together
when it happened.

07:59.729 --> 08:02.732
[sniffles]
I didn't even get to say goodbye.

08:07.737 --> 08:09.113
I got to say goodbye

08:10.281 --> 08:12.742
to my daughter… and my husband.

08:14.035 --> 08:16.370
But it wasn't enough. Feelings are just…

08:17.663 --> 08:19.207
They're too big for words.

08:21.709 --> 08:23.711
Luther loved you

08:25.546 --> 08:27.340
to the moon and back.

08:27.423 --> 08:29.008
[chuckles]

08:29.091 --> 08:30.885
You made him so happy.

08:33.304 --> 08:34.388
[sobs]

08:36.057 --> 08:37.141
[sniffles]

08:39.101 --> 08:42.230
[ominous string music playing]

08:42.313 --> 08:43.439
[Sloane sighs]

08:44.190 --> 08:46.192
No, she… she was with Sloane
in the tunnel.

08:46.275 --> 08:48.528
I'm not talking about Klaus.

08:49.195 --> 08:50.404
Luther?

08:51.405 --> 08:53.991
What? No, she would never do that.

08:54.075 --> 08:56.410
She's been unraveling
since we got to this timeline.

08:56.494 --> 08:59.455
-Yeah, she lost her daughter.
-And she killed Harlan.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.253
[Viktor] Even if you're right,

09:05.336 --> 09:08.297
I can't imagine they're just gonna
come clean if we confront them.

09:08.881 --> 09:09.840
I agree.

09:14.887 --> 09:16.639
[Klaus] Come on, man. Listen to me.

09:16.722 --> 09:19.809
I'm not going back down there
to get slapped around.

09:19.892 --> 09:21.811
And there's nothing
you can do to change that!

09:21.894 --> 09:24.438
You are so incredibly selfish!
Do you know that?

09:24.522 --> 09:26.190
Just relax! Don't worry.

09:26.274 --> 09:29.193
You have all the time in the world
to get over it!

09:29.777 --> 09:31.445
All right, that's it. [grunts]

09:31.529 --> 09:32.947
[Klaus giggles]

09:33.030 --> 09:33.948
Hah!

09:36.826 --> 09:37.827
Shit.

09:39.662 --> 09:40.496
[Luther grunts]

09:40.580 --> 09:41.831
Come on!

09:42.540 --> 09:45.710
I had to die, like, a million times
before figuring that one out.

09:45.793 --> 09:47.837
[choking] Again?

09:47.920 --> 09:49.589
Yes, again.

09:49.672 --> 09:50.756
[both grunt]

09:52.883 --> 09:54.176
[grunts]

09:55.469 --> 09:57.680
This is someone's idea of heaven?

09:57.763 --> 09:59.098
[Luther] Whoa! Oof!

09:59.890 --> 10:02.018
-What the--
-Hey, buddy.

10:02.101 --> 10:03.603
-You!
-No!

10:03.686 --> 10:05.438
Get back here! Get back here!

10:05.521 --> 10:06.480
That tickles!

10:06.564 --> 10:08.608
-[Luther] I…
-Let me go!

10:10.484 --> 10:12.069
-You.
-[hisses]

10:12.153 --> 10:14.030
You may not be able to feel pain,

10:14.113 --> 10:17.116
but I can throw you through walls
for all eternity, Klaus.

10:17.199 --> 10:20.161
You will never get a moment
of peace and quiet. I will never stop.

10:20.244 --> 10:22.413
No, no, no, no, no.

10:22.496 --> 10:24.790
The Void is my house.

10:24.874 --> 10:27.835
It might be a bouncy house, but it's mine!

10:29.879 --> 10:32.256
You don't wanna help the family, fine.

10:33.549 --> 10:36.093
But the love of my life
is walking into hell.

10:36.177 --> 10:39.722
I don't even know if I can.
I mean, who knows where they even went.

10:39.805 --> 10:42.058
Klaus, this is your house.

10:42.141 --> 10:43.559
-Yeah.
-You just said it.

10:43.643 --> 10:46.604
-Yeah.
-You… are the king of death.

10:46.687 --> 10:48.189
Oh, that's a little grandiose.

10:48.272 --> 10:50.399
I mean, I prefer to think of myself as…

10:50.483 --> 10:51.359
Yeah.

10:51.442 --> 10:53.152
…the Prince of Darkness.

10:53.235 --> 10:55.154
[imitates theremin] Oooh!

10:55.237 --> 10:56.238
Whatever!

10:57.740 --> 10:59.200
I believe in you, brother.

11:00.076 --> 11:01.702
You can do anything.

11:05.206 --> 11:06.874
-[Klaus] Oh, hey.
-[Luther] Hey.

11:06.957 --> 11:08.751
[Klaus] Sorry for crashing your party.

11:09.794 --> 11:11.879
Okay, fine. Okay. Listen, we'll do it.

11:11.962 --> 11:13.506
-We'll try, okay?
-Okay.

11:13.589 --> 11:17.218
Also, just like on a motivational scale
of one to, like, Braveheart…

11:17.301 --> 11:20.096
-Yeah?
-…this was like half a Rudy.

11:20.763 --> 11:23.849
-All right, notes later, pal. Notes later.
-I thought you could probably do better.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.169
-[clock winding]
-[Reginald] Blast it all to hell.

11:54.588 --> 11:55.798
We need to talk.

11:55.881 --> 11:58.300
-I'm quite busy. Can it wait?
-No, it can't.

11:59.009 --> 12:01.011
Luther and Klaus, did you kill them?

12:01.095 --> 12:03.472
There's a guardian lurking
in the corridors of this hotel.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.516
We have to defeat it
for this mission to succeed.

12:05.599 --> 12:08.060
What benefit would I gain
killing two members of our team?

12:08.144 --> 12:10.020
-Answer the question.
-I believe I just did.

12:10.646 --> 12:13.691
If I find out you're bullshitting me,
old man, the deal is off.

12:13.774 --> 12:16.569
I can assure you
I will keep my side of our agreement,

12:16.652 --> 12:18.571
and I expect you to do the same.

12:22.241 --> 12:24.243
-What was that all about?
-That's none of your concern.

12:24.326 --> 12:27.413
Not my concern?
We're here now, in the Hotel Oblivion.

12:27.496 --> 12:29.540
Just like you wanted. I made that happen.

12:29.623 --> 12:30.875
Don't be ridiculous.

12:30.958 --> 12:33.961
Allison killed Harlan,
and I united the families.

12:34.044 --> 12:35.629
What did you do, Number Two?

12:37.381 --> 12:38.591
[Reginald] Gather up, children.

12:39.341 --> 12:41.886
Now that we've had a chance
to catch our breath,

12:41.969 --> 12:43.596
the real work can begin.

12:43.679 --> 12:46.098
[Five] Ah, the myth
of the seven bells, eh?

12:46.182 --> 12:47.975
Exactly. Somebody's been paying attention.

12:48.058 --> 12:50.561
-Okay, so we find the bells, then what?
-[Reginald] No, no, no.

12:50.644 --> 12:53.272
The bells are just a metaphor for this.

12:54.315 --> 12:56.650
-The sigil.
-[Reginald] Correct, Number Five.

12:56.734 --> 12:58.778
The sigil is the key to the seven bells.

12:58.861 --> 13:01.197
Once we find this symbol,
we're one step closer

13:01.280 --> 13:02.531
to resetting the universe.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.158
What do we do when we find it?

13:04.658 --> 13:05.743
-I don't know.
-[gasps]

13:05.826 --> 13:08.412
Excuse me? We're here
because you said you have a plan.

13:08.496 --> 13:10.122
I do, up to a point.

13:10.206 --> 13:12.124
[Lila snickers] Great.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.335
So we'll just stay in the hotel forever,

13:14.418 --> 13:16.629
staring at the walls and eating bad sushi.

13:16.712 --> 13:18.547
Finding the sigil is
our only way out of here

13:18.631 --> 13:20.758
and the best chance
we have of resetting the universe.

13:20.841 --> 13:23.052
Funny how you and Dad
are on the same page again.

13:24.011 --> 13:26.806
-Okay, uh, where do we start?
-[Reginald] We'll split into groups.

13:26.889 --> 13:29.266
I will go with Allison and Sloane,
Ben and Five with Viktor.

13:29.350 --> 13:31.685
-No, we want Allison.
-Ben for Allison.

13:31.769 --> 13:35.564
We've trained together,
so it makes more sense if we take Allison.

13:35.648 --> 13:36.857
Yeah. No, thanks.

13:37.441 --> 13:38.359
Why not?

13:40.277 --> 13:41.237
Splendid idea.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.864
Allison, you go with the Umbrellas.
Sparrows, stick together.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.449
Everyone take a different floor.

13:45.533 --> 13:46.826
We must find that sigil.

13:46.909 --> 13:48.661
-What about us?
-[Reginald] You're a duo.

13:48.744 --> 13:50.830
Nobody wants to listen
to your endless bickering.

13:50.913 --> 13:54.792
Now, spread out, leave no stone unturned,
and meet back here in 30 minutes.

13:54.875 --> 13:56.710
[Ben] This is a total waste of time.

13:56.794 --> 13:58.671
Did you hear that? He called us a duo.

13:58.754 --> 13:59.713
[bell dings]

13:59.797 --> 14:01.799
[Lila] I think your father
is starting to grow on me.

14:06.679 --> 14:09.431
I forgot my journal.
Go on. I'll meet you on five.

14:10.641 --> 14:13.060
[elevator whirring]

14:16.021 --> 14:20.067
[ominous music swelling]

14:36.166 --> 14:39.295
[Allison] Someone went through
a lot of trouble to hide this thing.

14:39.378 --> 14:41.046
How big is it supposed to be?

14:41.130 --> 14:44.174
[Allison] You know,
dear old Reg didn't say.

14:44.258 --> 14:46.176
Really? Hm. That's surprising.

14:46.260 --> 14:48.429
I figured you'd know more about his plan.

14:49.221 --> 14:51.181
Sorry, what's that supposed to mean?

14:51.265 --> 14:53.517
I saw you and him
in the White Buffalo Suite

14:53.601 --> 14:54.852
during the wedding.

14:54.935 --> 14:56.687
I don't know if now's the right time--

14:56.770 --> 14:58.981
You know, I heard
that you blacked out last night.

14:59.064 --> 15:02.192
I did, and it took me a while
to remember what I saw,

15:02.276 --> 15:03.736
but I do remember, Allison.

15:04.570 --> 15:08.282
-You and Dad made some kind of deal.
-[Allison chuckles]

15:08.365 --> 15:10.200
What did you agree to?

15:10.284 --> 15:11.493
-[Allison] A deal?
-Mm-hmm.

15:11.577 --> 15:12.411
[Allison] With Dad?

15:13.203 --> 15:15.456
-Please tell me you're joking.
-He's not.

15:15.539 --> 15:16.498
[scoffs]

15:17.082 --> 15:18.876
[Five] Answer the question.

15:18.959 --> 15:20.419
You're out of your mind.

15:20.502 --> 15:22.963
You and Dad make a deal,
now Luther is dead.

15:23.047 --> 15:24.381
[Allison chuckles] Okay.

15:24.465 --> 15:26.884
Luther was killed
by whatever the hell that thing is.

15:26.967 --> 15:29.345
-And Klaus?
-He didn't make it into the tunnel.

15:29.428 --> 15:32.306
You know, your deal
is costing people their lives.

15:32.389 --> 15:34.975
Do you really think
that I made a deal with Dad

15:35.059 --> 15:37.353
to kill Luther and Klaus?

15:42.566 --> 15:44.485
I'm done. I'll meet you in the lobby.

15:44.568 --> 15:46.236
Hey… Hey, wait, no. [sighs]

15:47.196 --> 15:49.323
Wait… Five. [scoffs]

15:49.406 --> 15:50.407
Allison.

15:52.242 --> 15:53.661
No, just listen to me.

15:59.625 --> 16:00.960
[Five sniffs]

16:07.299 --> 16:09.009
Viktor? Allison?

16:09.760 --> 16:10.761
Okay.

16:14.723 --> 16:15.766
[sighs]

16:15.849 --> 16:17.184
[energy fluctuating]

16:20.771 --> 16:22.731
All right, so now the fun starts.

16:22.815 --> 16:25.484
[clock ticking faintly]

16:25.567 --> 16:28.362
No, I'm done with the two of you
and your conspiracy theories.

16:28.445 --> 16:29.780
Come on. Just listen to me--

16:29.863 --> 16:32.199
-Why should I, huh?
-[bell dings]

16:32.282 --> 16:34.326
You're the ones who voted to stay and die.

16:34.410 --> 16:36.954
You're the ones who said to hell
with family and the whole universe.

16:37.037 --> 16:39.248
I'm the only one fighting to save both.

16:39.331 --> 16:42.960
We just need to know what Dad is planning
before more of us get killed.

16:44.920 --> 16:46.296
Where the hell is Five?

16:47.131 --> 16:48.507
He was right behind me.

16:53.429 --> 16:54.430
Five?

16:57.516 --> 16:58.517
Five?

17:07.901 --> 17:11.071
-[bell dings]
-[elevator doors open]

17:15.200 --> 17:18.120
[elevator doors close]

17:20.456 --> 17:21.373
[Diego] Hey.

17:22.166 --> 17:24.418
We're gonna make it
out of this mess, all right?

17:24.501 --> 17:26.253
The three of us are gonna be fine.

17:26.754 --> 17:27.755
And then what?

17:28.464 --> 17:30.591
And then we'll be a happy family.

17:30.674 --> 17:31.884
No, we won't.

17:31.967 --> 17:35.679
Is this more of that bullshit
proving-yourself-to-be-a-good-dad stuff?

17:35.763 --> 17:37.765
-You passed, okay?
-I'm over it, all right?

17:37.848 --> 17:38.974
Wait, whoa, whoa.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.270
Oh, this isn't about me, huh?

17:44.605 --> 17:46.106
Oh, you're scared.

17:46.982 --> 17:48.442
[chuckles]

17:48.525 --> 17:50.444
It was easier with Stan, okay?

17:50.527 --> 17:52.071
You could have just said "sod off,"

17:52.154 --> 17:55.741
and then I wouldn't have had to tell you
about the baby

17:55.824 --> 17:57.367
or asked you to stay with me.

17:57.451 --> 17:59.953
Why tell the truth
when you can mindfuck someone

18:00.037 --> 18:02.706
into getting what you want
without having to be truly vulnerable?

18:02.790 --> 18:04.333
Do you know how crazy that is?

18:08.337 --> 18:11.590
But what if I fail our baby like… [gasps]

18:11.673 --> 18:13.050
…my mum failed me?

18:14.176 --> 18:15.427
Then you won't.

18:16.637 --> 18:19.264
Because behind the crazy bullshit,

18:20.182 --> 18:22.309
there's a good and decent person.

18:24.478 --> 18:26.188
-You sure?
-[scoffs gently]

18:26.271 --> 18:29.441
-One thousand percent.
-[Lila laughs, sniffles]

18:45.332 --> 18:46.333
Come on.

18:52.923 --> 18:55.092
Did we end up back at the same elevator?

18:56.844 --> 18:59.388
[Ben] Oh, don't forget
to check under the plants.

18:59.471 --> 19:02.474
Get off your ass and start inspecting
the walls for hidden compartments.

19:02.558 --> 19:03.517
Hey, uh,

19:04.268 --> 19:06.770
here's a wall and, uh…

19:07.563 --> 19:09.231
Oh, here's another wall.

19:09.314 --> 19:10.899
[Sloane] What the hell is wrong with you?

19:10.983 --> 19:13.902
People are dying left and right,
and you're acting like a sulky teenager.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.529
You sound just like Dad.

19:16.280 --> 19:18.490
Why is it so important
for Dad to like you?

19:18.574 --> 19:20.409
He doesn't define you or us.

19:20.492 --> 19:22.369
We made our own mark
in this world without him.

19:22.452 --> 19:25.080
As the Sparrow Academy,
but they're gone now.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.415
He was never a Sparrow.

19:26.498 --> 19:30.002
He was our dad, and a shitty one at that.
You don't need him.

19:30.085 --> 19:32.838
Easy for you to say
when you've already got a new family.

19:34.339 --> 19:36.717
And the best part
of that family just died.

19:37.509 --> 19:40.512
I can't believe I'm saying this.
I'm actually glad to see you guys.

19:42.222 --> 19:44.349
-What's wrong?
-The hotel is changing.

19:44.433 --> 19:47.644
I've been walking around in circles,
but it's like the thing is alive.

19:47.728 --> 19:49.563
-We should get to the lobby.
-[Five] Tried it.

19:49.646 --> 19:52.191
Whatever direction I choose,
I end up in the same spot.

19:52.274 --> 19:53.984
Or maybe you have no sense of direction.

19:54.067 --> 19:56.403
Okay, lead the way, Magellan.

19:56.486 --> 19:58.947
[ominous instrumental music playing]

19:59.031 --> 19:59.865
[scoffs]

20:03.869 --> 20:04.870
[Allison] Five?

20:05.662 --> 20:06.663
Five?

20:06.747 --> 20:07.956
[Viktor] Five?

20:08.040 --> 20:09.041
Five?

20:09.791 --> 20:12.878
-[sighs] Where is he?
-How the hell am I supposed to know?

20:13.503 --> 20:15.923
Come on. We can't keep doing this.

20:16.882 --> 20:19.927
Please, how do we get back
to the way things were?

20:20.010 --> 20:22.512
Before that fake apology and--

20:22.596 --> 20:23.805
And the lies?

20:24.514 --> 20:26.892
Allison, come on. How do we do that?

20:28.227 --> 20:29.186
[sighs]

20:29.811 --> 20:31.438
I don't know that we can.

20:36.985 --> 20:41.114
[pages flipping]

20:44.326 --> 20:45.494
Problem, Dad?

20:46.203 --> 20:47.329
You!

20:47.412 --> 20:48.664
You missed me.

20:48.747 --> 20:51.166
There's only one way into Oblivion.
It's not possible.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.460
Well, here I am.

20:53.543 --> 20:54.711
Fascinating!

20:54.795 --> 20:57.839
I wish I could explore this more, my boy,
but now isn't a good time.

20:57.923 --> 21:00.300
You used me,
you know, to get the family here.

21:00.384 --> 21:03.262
I get it, but you… you used me.

21:03.345 --> 21:06.473
And when I was no more use to you,
you leave me to die on the floor?

21:06.556 --> 21:07.557
Leave you to die?

21:07.641 --> 21:09.226
I did you a favor.

21:09.309 --> 21:12.145
I knew you'd find your way back
to the Void where you belong.

21:13.063 --> 21:13.981
I do like it there.

21:14.064 --> 21:16.984
-Then why are you here?
-Because you murdered Luther.

21:17.067 --> 21:18.485
It was necessary. And effective.

21:18.568 --> 21:22.656
Who's next, Dad? Five?
Viktor? The whole goddamn family?

21:22.739 --> 21:25.909
Stop this at once! Everyone's in position.
The battle's about to begin.

21:25.993 --> 21:29.288
I am one bell ring away from my prize.
You're going to ruin everything!

21:29.371 --> 21:33.250
Oh, if I had a nickel for every time
I heard that, I'd have a dollar.

21:33.834 --> 21:35.043
Which isn't that much money,

21:35.127 --> 21:37.254
but then again,
there are those dollar stores

21:37.337 --> 21:39.548
which are quite reas-- [grunts]

21:39.631 --> 21:40.799
That's that.

21:41.466 --> 21:45.053
[dramatic string music swells]

21:45.679 --> 21:48.473
[gong resonates]

21:48.557 --> 21:50.225
[rumbling]

21:51.184 --> 21:52.602
[loud thudding]

22:00.235 --> 22:01.820
[metal scraping]

22:13.248 --> 22:14.791
[Diego] Does no one listen to me?

22:14.875 --> 22:16.460
[Lila] No, sweetie, we don't.

22:20.005 --> 22:21.340
We should get back to the lobby.

22:22.382 --> 22:23.258
Yeah.

22:23.342 --> 22:26.303
Which one of our moronic siblings
do you think rang the damn bell?

22:28.889 --> 22:30.432
[guardian snarls]

22:30.515 --> 22:31.850
[Allison whimpers]

22:31.933 --> 22:34.061
[screams in pain]

22:34.144 --> 22:34.978
[Viktor] Allison!

22:38.857 --> 22:41.234
-[Allison groans]
-[Viktor] Allison, we gotta go!

22:41.318 --> 22:43.070
[guardian roaring]

22:43.153 --> 22:44.988
Allison, get up! Let's go!

22:47.115 --> 22:49.951
[both panting]

You were right, okay?
I made a deal with Dad.

25:05.504 --> 25:06.505
Luther and Klaus?

25:06.588 --> 25:08.882
No, I had nothing to do with that.
I swear.

25:16.431 --> 25:17.557
Why tell me now?

25:17.641 --> 25:20.477
[panting]
Because I need you to believe me, okay?

25:20.560 --> 25:22.479
That I did this for all of us.

25:22.562 --> 25:24.064
Luther and Klaus too.

25:24.648 --> 25:25.649
What did he offer you?

25:27.192 --> 25:28.568
I need you to trust me.

25:29.152 --> 25:31.988
Look at me. If we get through this,
everything's gonna be okay.

25:48.129 --> 25:49.214
[Allison] Viktor?

25:49.714 --> 25:50.715
Allison?

25:52.926 --> 25:53.927
Viktor!

25:56.179 --> 25:57.389
Allison?

25:57.472 --> 25:58.557
[bell dings]

26:01.226 --> 26:03.061
I told you to go, okay?

26:03.144 --> 26:05.272
And let you die alone?
What's the fun in that?

26:05.355 --> 26:06.523
And the baby?

26:06.606 --> 26:08.650
-You let me worry about that.
-No, I'm its father.

26:08.733 --> 26:11.403
Who has no part in the gestation
of the baby for the next six months.

26:11.486 --> 26:12.445
-Nice try.
-[Diego] Okay.

26:12.529 --> 26:14.239
So I can't convince you
to sit this one out?

26:14.322 --> 26:16.575
-Finally, you're getting it.
-You're right.

26:17.200 --> 26:18.910
-I do.

26:18.994 --> 26:19.995

Hey!

26:22.706 --> 26:25.250
-[Lila] What do you think you're doing?
-I'm protecting my family.

26:25.333 --> 26:27.252
[Lila] No, no, no, no.
Diego, don't leave me.

26:27.335 --> 26:28.211
I'm sorry.

26:28.962 --> 26:32.215
-You promised we'd always be together!
-I know, I know.

26:32.299 --> 26:34.593
Diego, no, no, no, no, no. Don't do this.

26:34.676 --> 26:36.678
When the baby gets here, tell him

26:37.512 --> 26:38.513
or her

26:39.639 --> 26:40.932
about the man I was.

26:42.350 --> 26:43.685
The man I tried to be.

26:44.853 --> 26:47.188
No, no, no, no, no, Diego. No, no.

26:47.272 --> 26:49.858
[Lila pounding on door] Diego! Diego!

26:50.650 --> 26:51.776
[Lila sobbing]

26:53.445 --> 26:55.739
You've hit him with your ax five times.
He should be dead by now.

26:55.822 --> 26:57.324
The armor. It's like hitting cement.

26:57.407 --> 27:00.619

-We need to get behind him.

27:00.702 --> 27:02.162

27:02.245 --> 27:03.747
-Let's kill this thing.

[Lila] Shit.

28:42.095 --> 28:43.138

28:43.221 --> 28:44.889
-I'm tired of running.
-Me too.

28:46.891 --> 28:50.729
[dramatic orchestral music swells]

28:53.773 --> 28:55.233
This feels oddly familiar.

28:56.359 --> 28:58.611
At least this time,
we're not aiming at each other.

29:10.081 --> 29:12.584
[sizzling]

29:12.667 --> 29:14.210
[Lila laughs]

29:15.879 --> 29:16.713
Let's go.

29:22.427 --> 29:23.303
[groans]

29:24.721 --> 29:25.638
Klaus?

29:26.139 --> 29:27.098
[bell dings]

29:30.351 --> 29:32.896
-Oh my God, Klaus. Are you okay?
-[Diego] Lila!

29:32.979 --> 29:34.439
-How'd you get out?
-What happened?

29:34.522 --> 29:37.734
-We thought you died.
-[Klaus groans] If only. Hey.

29:37.817 --> 29:39.778
-Hey, you okay?
-[Klaus] Yeah, I think so.

29:39.861 --> 29:41.654
-[Five] Klaus.
-You look like hell.

29:41.738 --> 29:43.323
Why don't you try killing a guardian?

29:43.406 --> 29:45.241
-We just did.
-[Ben] So did we.

29:45.325 --> 29:46.743
I told you to stay in the--

29:53.374 --> 29:54.626
[grumbles] I love you!

29:54.709 --> 29:56.294
[Sloane] Klaus, I thought you were dead.

29:56.377 --> 29:58.755
Yes, yes, I'm alive and amazing,

29:58.838 --> 30:01.007
despite Dad's attempts
to bash my brains in,

30:01.090 --> 30:03.176
but tearful reunions later.

30:03.259 --> 30:06.179
What you guys need to know
right now is that

30:07.514 --> 30:08.932
Dad killed Luther.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.643
And he locked me out of the tunnel,

30:11.726 --> 30:14.395
and he rang that stupid bell!

30:14.479 --> 30:16.314
What's your plan, old man?

30:16.397 --> 30:18.691
-[Reginald] We don't have time for this.
-You killed Luther!

30:18.775 --> 30:21.152
I had no choice.
You refused to come together as a team.

30:21.236 --> 30:22.987
All of your stupid myths and stories.

30:23.071 --> 30:25.740
There were never seven bells or Norsemen.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.659
-You brought us here to die!
-That's not so.

30:27.742 --> 30:30.870
Somewhere in this hotel
is the key to resetting the universe.

30:30.954 --> 30:32.497
We just need to find the sigil!

30:32.580 --> 30:34.582
I don't care about your sigil!
None of us do.

30:34.666 --> 30:38.002
[Diego] We barely survived that guardian
with his stupid helmet and his sickle!

30:39.003 --> 30:41.089
The guardian we killed had an ax.

30:41.172 --> 30:42.549
Ours had a sword.

30:43.466 --> 30:44.467
[both] There's one left.

30:45.593 --> 30:46.678
We have to go after it.

30:46.761 --> 30:48.763
Because that worked so well
the first time.

30:48.847 --> 30:51.891
[Klaus] You got any painkillers,
or could you just please shut up?

30:51.975 --> 30:54.394
[dramatic orchestral music building]

30:54.477 --> 30:57.897
[Klaus] Could you just keep it down
to a dull roar?

30:57.981 --> 30:59.315
Do you think you could…

31:04.320 --> 31:05.905

All those years I stayed loyal to you.

32:50.718 --> 32:53.221
You wasted my life on the moon,
and for what?

32:54.180 --> 32:56.140
To use me on this stupid mission?

32:56.224 --> 32:57.600
You did have a purpose.

32:58.351 --> 33:01.062
I left you to guard
the most precious thing in the universe.

33:01.145 --> 33:01.980
And what was it?

33:02.772 --> 33:04.190
You'll soon understand.

You all will.

33:26.421 --> 33:28.840
[faintly] I can't… hold it.

33:36.472 --> 33:38.224
I will love you forever.
