WEBVTT

00:06.040 --> 00:09.960
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:54.120 --> 00:55.440
At this hour?

00:57.240 --> 00:59.280
-Who could it be?
-I'll go and see.

01:12.400 --> 01:13.520
Who is it?

01:13.600 --> 01:15.920
Good evening. We need you to come with us.

01:16.440 --> 01:17.360
Where to?

01:28.360 --> 01:31.000
Can we come in?
We don't want to wake the neighbors.

01:31.680 --> 01:32.640
Excuse me.

01:41.480 --> 01:42.520
Ursula?

01:43.600 --> 01:44.800
What's going on?

01:46.360 --> 01:50.000
-They want me to go back to Glória.
-Now? You can go tomorrow. I'll take you.

01:59.640 --> 02:01.560
Don't worry, César.

02:19.760 --> 02:21.440
I'll call you as soon as I can.

02:23.800 --> 02:25.240
Want me to come with you?

02:25.760 --> 02:28.480
It's probably an urgent recording
they want to broadcast.

02:34.120 --> 02:35.600
I need to hurry.

02:45.640 --> 02:47.320
What happened to the kid?

02:48.240 --> 02:49.320
A land mine.

02:50.960 --> 02:53.400
He lost his legs, one of his arms.

02:53.480 --> 02:56.040
But they can't bury him
until his father arrives from France.

02:56.120 --> 02:56.960
He moved there.

03:01.360 --> 03:02.920
Would you like some sugar, sir?

03:04.920 --> 03:06.800
No, no sugar, thank you.

03:07.480 --> 03:09.040
I've been looking for you.

03:09.560 --> 03:10.960
I just came to get coffee.

03:11.480 --> 03:15.080
I need your help repairing a transistor.
Can you come with me and take care of it?

03:18.080 --> 03:19.320
Thank you, Ermelinda.

03:22.040 --> 03:24.920
Gonçalo was supposed to fix it,
but he was called in

03:25.000 --> 03:27.080
because of the broadcast last night.

03:27.160 --> 03:28.760
Is the translator here as well?

03:28.840 --> 03:30.760
One of them will have
to explain what happened.

03:31.280 --> 03:33.400
It definitely wasn't me.
I have little to contribute.

03:33.920 --> 03:35.600
I didn't even touch that reel.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.200
I took her some tea.

05:05.280 --> 05:08.720
Mrs. Ursula was in a hurry
and had to rush to the studio.

05:08.800 --> 05:10.440
Was she alone in the studio?

05:10.520 --> 05:12.680
-Want me to pour it?
-Yes, please.

05:13.440 --> 05:14.280
Yes.

05:25.320 --> 05:27.400
Did you see anyone in the corridor?

05:27.480 --> 05:29.080
I didn't see anyone.

07:59.840 --> 08:01.480
Did you tell them we…

08:02.680 --> 08:03.680
No.

08:07.240 --> 08:10.920
I just said that I checked the reel
and gave it to the engineer.

08:12.240 --> 08:14.720
If you didn't say anything,
there's no need to worry.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.360
That's not true.

08:18.280 --> 08:21.520
I didn't do my job.
I didn't even listen to the recording.

08:22.160 --> 08:24.160
Many people have disappeared
for a lot less.

08:26.440 --> 08:28.520
Is that what happened to the telegrapher?

08:30.000 --> 08:30.880
No.

08:31.760 --> 08:34.000
It was something else. She…

08:34.520 --> 08:36.200
I don't know. She had an affair

08:36.280 --> 08:38.600
with someone from RARET
and probably chose to leave.

08:38.680 --> 08:40.920
-Who did she have an affair with?
-Does it matter?

08:42.560 --> 08:43.880
No, you're right.

08:45.720 --> 08:48.960
Did they say anything else?
Can you go home now?

08:50.840 --> 08:54.240
Ask one of the women here to call me
and check that I made it home.

10:00.880 --> 10:02.680
You don't have to go to war.

10:03.200 --> 10:04.600
How can I not, Mom?

10:05.720 --> 10:07.280
Many flee to France.

10:07.360 --> 10:10.400
He might never return.
What if they catch him?

10:11.280 --> 10:14.000
I'd rather have a deserter
than a dead man for a son.

10:16.280 --> 10:18.640
-What about Carolina?
-She'll go with you.

10:19.560 --> 10:21.760
If you think going to France
is the right thing.

10:23.440 --> 10:25.960
-Is Isaura inside?
-She is.

10:26.760 --> 10:29.200
But first Fernando
has something to tell you.

10:30.320 --> 10:31.360
Fernando?

10:32.560 --> 10:33.640
Not here.

10:43.040 --> 10:44.040
What is it?

10:45.560 --> 10:46.480
What's wrong?

10:50.160 --> 10:51.600
I don't want to go to war.

10:53.280 --> 10:54.600
No one does.

10:55.160 --> 10:58.640
Tomorrow or the day after,
we'll pack our things and flee to Paris.

11:00.280 --> 11:02.840
We have friends there
who can help us get jobs.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.880
I can't speak the language.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.200
But I'll wait for you.

11:11.960 --> 11:15.280
You'll come back.
So many have gone and come back.

11:15.360 --> 11:17.120
Nobody comes back okay, Carolina.

11:18.200 --> 11:19.440
At least marry me.

11:19.960 --> 11:24.480
I could leave a power of attorney.
Married people have more rights.

11:24.560 --> 11:26.520
It can keep me
from going to the front line.

11:31.720 --> 11:34.440
Fine, as you wish.

11:53.480 --> 11:56.680
-Hey. You didn't get the beer, did you?
-Great music.

11:56.760 --> 11:58.800
-It's great, isn't it?
-Yeah, it is.

11:59.320 --> 12:01.960
You know,
this is also already going out of fashion.

12:02.040 --> 12:04.040
Even the Beatles are moving towards

12:04.120 --> 12:07.800
a different kind of vibe,
more of a psychedelic kind of rock.

12:08.600 --> 12:10.480
-João.
-Big Mig, hey.

12:10.560 --> 12:12.680
-Thank you.
-Listen. Pretty naughty.

12:15.800 --> 12:17.080
João?

12:18.360 --> 12:21.080
Did you smoke any liamba
when you were stationed in Africa?

12:21.600 --> 12:25.120
They say it helps with the fear
when you're sent to the front line.

12:26.840 --> 12:30.400
-I don't trust those who are never afraid.
-Depends on the situation.

12:31.280 --> 12:34.080
Lots of them come back
with serious anxiety disorders.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.200
And the brave come back dead.

12:37.080 --> 12:37.960
Yeah.

12:38.480 --> 12:41.040
Do you know a poem called
"A Recipe for a Hero"?

12:41.560 --> 12:42.720
No.

12:42.800 --> 12:46.960
It goes, "Take a man
Made of nothing, like we are"

12:47.040 --> 12:48.320
"A full-sized man"

12:49.520 --> 12:54.160
"Soak his flesh, slowly
In a sharp, irrational certainty"

12:56.440 --> 12:59.840
"As intense as hatred or hunger"

12:59.920 --> 13:03.960
"Then, near the end
Wave a flag, sound a bugle"

13:04.720 --> 13:06.080
"Serve him up dead"

13:11.840 --> 13:12.880
Reinaldo Ferreira.

13:14.200 --> 13:17.840
Well… what do you want to listen to next?

13:18.360 --> 13:21.440
-Something cheerful.
-Cheerful, yeah.

13:21.520 --> 13:23.440
Something cheerful because that now was…

13:23.520 --> 13:25.680
I also have… We can listen to it later.

13:40.640 --> 13:42.680
-May I?
-Come in, João.

13:49.520 --> 13:52.720
-I'd like to learn how to develop photos.
-Whenever you want.

13:57.040 --> 13:59.000
Was this party at RARET too?

13:59.720 --> 14:01.120
On the Fourth of July.

14:03.960 --> 14:05.160
Mia.

14:07.160 --> 14:08.360
You know her?

14:10.120 --> 14:11.680
Yeah, we met in Lisbon.

14:14.760 --> 14:15.880
João.

14:19.360 --> 14:22.000
The passports will be here in two days.

14:22.520 --> 14:23.960
I won't need them.

14:24.720 --> 14:25.720
Ready?

14:27.800 --> 14:28.800
Not sure.

14:30.880 --> 14:33.240
I'd be more worried if you said you were.

14:36.840 --> 14:38.400
Do you know why she left?

14:40.680 --> 14:42.880
Hey, Mr. Engineer João Vidal!

14:43.400 --> 14:46.800
Come here. We need to clean
the head of the player.

14:51.120 --> 14:52.400
It's good!

15:05.000 --> 15:06.240
One second.

15:10.080 --> 15:11.320
I'm coming.

15:21.720 --> 15:22.680
Good morning.

15:23.680 --> 15:25.520
What are you doing at RARET, Dad?

15:26.160 --> 15:29.160
You're going to work like that,
with your shirt all wrinkled?

15:31.360 --> 15:33.640
I fell asleep on the couch,
listening to the radio.

15:36.440 --> 15:38.160
If you returned your mother's calls,

15:38.240 --> 15:41.680
you'd know that I'm in town
for the funeral of a local soldier.

15:42.920 --> 15:44.840
We're all very worried about you.

15:44.920 --> 15:46.720
I survived a war.

15:46.800 --> 15:48.840
I can survive a few months
in the countryside.

15:48.920 --> 15:52.520
I know you've been seen drinking
almost every night at the Gado Bravo Inn.

15:52.600 --> 15:53.880
Many people I know go there.

15:53.960 --> 15:55.840
Hope you haven't made a fool of yourself.

15:55.920 --> 15:56.840
Never.

15:58.200 --> 16:01.160
Would you like some coffee?
I can make some, or we can go to--

16:01.240 --> 16:04.400
Get dressed. I want you beside me
at the memorial service.

16:04.480 --> 16:06.160
I start work in an hour.

16:06.240 --> 16:07.680
You've been excused.

16:08.680 --> 16:10.840
Take a shower and put on a dark suit.

16:51.200 --> 16:52.640
Are you staying home today?

16:54.080 --> 16:56.280
I was told not to go into work.

17:03.880 --> 17:05.320
Go inside.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.840
My boy!

17:41.440 --> 17:44.720
My baby boy!

17:59.200 --> 18:01.080
This is all your fault!

18:07.480 --> 18:09.160
Let's get this over with.

18:34.720 --> 18:36.800
This is full of communist propaganda.

18:52.680 --> 18:54.760
You never mention
those two years in Angola.

18:54.840 --> 18:57.840
In your letters, you never said
what was happening there.

19:00.280 --> 19:02.720
We did what we were trained to do.

19:02.800 --> 19:04.560
You didn't have to go.

19:05.240 --> 19:07.520
I did what I was supposed to do, Dad.

19:08.200 --> 19:09.920
Your mother will never forgive me.

19:11.680 --> 19:14.600
It was the Soviets
who corrupted the darkies.

19:15.120 --> 19:16.960
Them and the Americans.

19:17.680 --> 19:19.880
The Cold War
is taking place in Africa too.

19:20.400 --> 19:23.800
Fortunately, those people have no idea
how to think for themselves.

19:24.600 --> 19:28.240
Salazar has the Americans
eating out of his hand because of RARET

19:28.320 --> 19:30.520
and Lajes Air Force Base in the Azores.

19:30.600 --> 19:31.840
If we end the concession,

19:31.920 --> 19:35.040
they can't refuel planes
in the middle of the Atlantic.

19:35.120 --> 19:37.680
He can only play that card once.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.720
But no one wants that.

19:40.240 --> 19:44.200
The Americans have to be our allies,
not our enemies. The enemy is in Moscow.

19:44.720 --> 19:47.200
If I ever become president of the Council…

19:48.480 --> 19:49.880
Is that a possibility?

19:54.320 --> 19:56.640
Salazar is not going to last forever.

19:57.360 --> 20:00.120
And the Americans just assured me
that I have their support.

20:02.240 --> 20:04.160
Do they have that much influence?

20:04.800 --> 20:06.520
We'll have to wait and see.

20:07.520 --> 20:10.520
The old man is a problem
because his hatred of communism

20:10.600 --> 20:13.240
is not very different
from his hatred of capitalism.

20:13.760 --> 20:17.680
What the country needs right now
is economic change.

20:20.840 --> 20:24.240
Try to come to Lisbon this weekend
to visit your mother.

20:27.080 --> 20:28.480
And behave yourself.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.280
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

20:36.360 --> 20:39.000
Can I have a double espresso, please?

20:41.080 --> 20:44.760
If coffee didn't make me so jumpy,
I'd drink it to see if it wakes me up.

20:46.040 --> 20:48.120
Why's that? Did you have a bad night too?

20:48.840 --> 20:49.760
Yeah.

20:51.960 --> 20:53.640
Fernando's leaving today.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.800
You know what the worst thing is
about Africa?

21:05.240 --> 21:06.440
It's the weather.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.280
But people from Glória
are used to the heat,

21:10.360 --> 21:11.480
so he won't even notice.

21:11.560 --> 21:14.080
Why doesn't anyone talk
about what's going on there?

21:14.600 --> 21:16.880
-It feels like it's all one big secret.
-It's war.

21:17.920 --> 21:19.920
All wars are probably the same.

21:24.600 --> 21:26.760
He'll come back. Don't worry.

21:28.360 --> 21:30.320
-See you later.
-See you later.

21:52.240 --> 21:55.360
-That's a husky voice. That's a--
-What's this you're listening to?

21:55.920 --> 21:58.240
Go on, come in.
Come in and close the door.

21:58.760 --> 22:02.480
We just received some new music reels.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.920
We're making a copy for the boys.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.560
I like this song. Jacqueline Taïeb.

22:09.480 --> 22:12.320
And that one… That one's next.

22:13.160 --> 22:14.440
It's for us.

22:15.200 --> 22:16.120
Right?

22:26.680 --> 22:27.560
Carolina?

22:28.080 --> 22:29.160
Sir.

22:30.240 --> 22:33.160
A girl as pretty as you
shouldn't look so sad.

22:37.000 --> 22:40.920
Remember that you're not alone.
You can count on me for anything you need.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.200
Yes, sir, I know.

22:42.280 --> 22:43.360
Carolina?

22:44.640 --> 22:46.440
We have to go, honey. Come on.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.000
Where were you?

23:15.080 --> 23:16.600
I went to see Anne.

23:17.360 --> 23:19.200
You're friends with the American now?

23:21.000 --> 23:23.640
We're in the middle of nowhere.
I need friends.

23:24.520 --> 23:26.600
You have me. Isn't that enough?

23:27.120 --> 23:29.160
I'm going to go get dinner ready.

23:33.600 --> 23:35.720
Is that the blouse
I brought you from Lisbon?

23:36.920 --> 23:37.760
Yes.

23:41.320 --> 23:45.240
My wife comes home,
and I don't even get a kiss?

23:45.320 --> 23:47.440
Please, Ramiro, don't.

23:48.960 --> 23:51.840
Don't? Why not? We're all alone.

23:51.920 --> 23:53.360
But I don't want to.

23:55.280 --> 23:56.200
What about me?

23:56.840 --> 23:59.160
-Don't you care what I want?
-I don't want to.

23:59.240 --> 24:01.480
I said I don't want to, Ramiro.

24:01.560 --> 24:02.400
Ramiro…

24:03.160 --> 24:04.080
Be quiet!

24:05.000 --> 24:06.960
Ramiro, I said I don't want to.

24:07.480 --> 24:08.440
I don't want to!

24:09.120 --> 24:10.880
-Please, Ramiro.
-Shut up!

24:13.840 --> 24:14.680
Ramiro!

25:08.280 --> 25:10.960
Do you want to see something cool?
Look at this.

25:16.280 --> 25:17.280
Look at that.

25:19.800 --> 25:22.080
Have you ever wondered
what they're talking about?

25:23.160 --> 25:24.280
I don't care.

25:25.200 --> 25:27.120
I keep my nose clean, and I do my job.

25:33.320 --> 25:34.800
Were they hard on you?

25:35.800 --> 25:36.640
A little.

25:37.520 --> 25:39.320
They asked me a few questions.

25:40.920 --> 25:43.480
If I were guilty,
it wouldn't have been nice at all.

25:44.080 --> 25:45.760
You think it was the translator?

25:45.840 --> 25:49.840
It had to be her.
These foreigners, they're all whores.

25:50.360 --> 25:52.480
They sell themselves
to the highest bidder.

25:53.840 --> 25:55.280
Mia too?

25:56.480 --> 25:59.200
They told me that she was seeing
someone here at RARET.

26:02.040 --> 26:05.360
You… I knew
there was something between you two.

26:07.800 --> 26:11.480
I would love to help you out, João,
but we weren't that close.

26:52.360 --> 26:54.200
It's simple. The negative goes in here.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.720
You just adjust the paper to the enlarger.

26:56.800 --> 26:59.680
Did they let you build a darkroom,
or do they not know?

27:00.200 --> 27:01.920
I asked James for permission.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.280
You let the printing paper burn,

27:05.280 --> 27:06.160
and…

27:06.800 --> 27:08.280
-Can I take a look?
-Sure.

27:08.800 --> 27:11.200
You place the paper in the developer,

27:11.720 --> 27:14.800
and this is where the magic happens
and the image comes through.

27:15.400 --> 27:19.240
When you think the density is right,
you place it in the stop bath.

27:19.760 --> 27:22.120
-Gonçalo.
-What about him?

27:23.840 --> 27:26.000
I thought he didn't know Mia very well.

27:26.080 --> 27:29.360
Mia? I would say
he probably knew her too well.

27:30.120 --> 27:33.440
Lastly, you place it in the fixer.
The name says it all.

27:33.520 --> 27:37.000
And then run it under the tap
to remove all the chemicals.

27:41.320 --> 27:43.120
Tomé, another one, please.

27:43.200 --> 27:44.560
-Good afternoon.
-Afternoon.

27:49.280 --> 27:51.520
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

27:51.600 --> 27:53.800
An express ticket to Lisbon, please.

27:54.960 --> 27:56.840
The tickets cost ten escudos.

27:57.920 --> 27:58.880
Thank you.

27:59.480 --> 28:01.640
-Look, it's about to leave.
-I know.

28:02.160 --> 28:03.160
Have a safe trip.

28:32.440 --> 28:34.760
-Let us know how you are.
-I'll write you.

28:39.360 --> 28:40.560
This isn't right.

28:42.040 --> 28:43.320
Be brave, kid.

28:43.840 --> 28:45.400
We're very proud of you.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.440
Okay, it's time to go.

28:59.920 --> 29:00.960
Son…

29:07.920 --> 29:08.760
Here.

29:09.720 --> 29:10.640
Take this for luck.

29:10.720 --> 29:12.920
And don't forget
I'm right here waiting for you.

29:17.560 --> 29:19.040
We should have run away.

29:26.920 --> 29:31.160
LISBON

29:58.880 --> 30:00.200
We found him.

30:06.360 --> 30:08.320
What are the Special Forces doing here?

30:09.160 --> 30:10.760
They brought in a deserter.

30:20.480 --> 30:21.760
That'll be me one day.

30:25.120 --> 30:27.240
It's not too long till we go home.

30:29.080 --> 30:31.720
I saw you reading
the propaganda we seized.

30:35.080 --> 30:36.080
I was curious.

30:37.800 --> 30:38.960
I've been watching you.

30:39.040 --> 30:41.920
They told us to be careful around you,
given who your father is.

30:42.440 --> 30:44.640
But sons aren't always
the same as their fathers.

30:47.640 --> 30:50.640
If you're still curious,
I have more stuff that you can read.

31:08.960 --> 31:10.160
Carolina?

31:12.680 --> 31:13.520
Carolina!

31:15.920 --> 31:16.760
Fernando?

31:17.600 --> 31:18.480
Help me!

31:36.600 --> 31:38.120
I'm telling them everything.

31:38.920 --> 31:40.240
Please don't do that.

31:40.320 --> 31:43.280
You'll make it worse
and get into an even bigger mess.

31:43.360 --> 31:45.560
I'll ask them not to say anything
to my husband.

31:45.640 --> 31:47.080
He'll find out eventually.

31:48.800 --> 31:51.920
I know you're scared,
but there's no point in ruining your life

31:52.000 --> 31:53.240
because of a reel.

31:53.760 --> 31:55.640
-Your husband--
-I don't care about him.

31:55.720 --> 31:57.080
I don't want to go to jail!

31:59.760 --> 32:01.920
Nobody is going to hurt you.

32:03.720 --> 32:06.600
They were hard on you
so that you would be afraid.

32:07.720 --> 32:10.480
But if you talk,
they'll make you the scapegoat.

32:11.080 --> 32:12.800
That's going to happen anyway.

32:15.440 --> 32:16.920
You have to help me.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.440
You know people.

32:20.160 --> 32:22.520
Your father was in charge
of PIDE for many years.

32:22.600 --> 32:26.640
I know how these things work.
That's why I'm telling you to keep quiet.

32:27.760 --> 32:30.200
Forget it. I won't take any chances.

32:30.280 --> 32:32.760
Just keep quiet
and wait for this to sort itself out!

32:33.800 --> 32:35.800
Tomorrow I'll come to Lisbon,
and we'll talk.

32:35.880 --> 32:37.960
Why are you talking to me like that?

32:42.440 --> 32:43.640
João, was it you?

32:47.680 --> 32:49.200
Did you switch the reel?

32:50.960 --> 32:53.200
How could you even think that?

32:53.920 --> 32:56.280
That doesn't make any sense.

32:58.400 --> 33:00.360
I will not risk my life for you.

33:06.680 --> 33:08.560
I'll go to Lisbon and talk to her.

33:09.080 --> 33:11.560
There's no need. I'll take care of it.

33:12.880 --> 33:15.480
Ursula is scared, but she's harmless.

33:16.680 --> 33:20.120
Don't let your feelings
for the girl cloud your judgment.

33:21.720 --> 33:23.120
I'll take care of it.

33:30.200 --> 33:32.480
Just do what you have to do at RARET.

34:00.720 --> 34:02.000
Of course it was.

34:37.120 --> 34:39.040
Can I get a coffee, please?

34:42.920 --> 34:46.520
Do you mind if I borrow your newspaper
to take a quick look at the car section?

34:46.600 --> 34:48.280
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

35:13.040 --> 35:14.040
Thank you.

35:15.440 --> 35:16.280
You're welcome.

35:31.240 --> 35:32.440
What are you looking for?

35:43.720 --> 35:46.120
You're not going to find anything.
Ursula--

35:46.200 --> 35:47.600
Sir!

36:36.120 --> 36:38.760
They're fabricating a story
to accuse me of spying.

36:39.520 --> 36:40.960
What else did Adam tell you?

36:41.960 --> 36:44.960
Nothing else.
But it's enough to know what's coming.

36:45.520 --> 36:47.400
Was it the Americans, seeking revenge?

36:48.000 --> 36:49.680
No. I don't know.

36:50.760 --> 36:52.480
It will make you look guilty.

36:54.320 --> 36:58.720
César, I won't sit around,
waiting for PIDE to come and get me.

37:03.240 --> 37:06.000
I'll go with you.
I have the keys to the farm.

37:06.080 --> 37:08.000
We can go to Minho
until things quiet down.

37:08.080 --> 37:09.800
They won't quiet down.

37:11.920 --> 37:13.880
If you come with me,
you'll lose everything.

37:14.560 --> 37:15.840
I'll take my chances.

37:20.040 --> 37:22.120
César. This way.

38:00.120 --> 38:04.080
-Ursula Kowalski? Agent Brito. PIDE.
-I didn't do anything. Let me go.

38:04.160 --> 38:06.480
-Come with me.
-You can't just take her without--

38:06.560 --> 38:08.160
-It's just a few questions.
-César.

38:16.480 --> 38:19.880
Where are you taking her?
Is it to the headquarters?

38:22.040 --> 38:23.920
I didn't do anything!

38:25.120 --> 38:26.280
Please!

38:27.360 --> 38:28.600
I…

38:29.800 --> 38:31.080
I haven't done anything.

38:40.120 --> 38:42.040
What happens now depends on you.

38:42.560 --> 38:45.000
Who hired you to switch the recording?

38:46.240 --> 38:47.800
Who is your handler in Portugal?

38:47.880 --> 38:48.880
No one.

38:49.600 --> 38:51.520
I didn't do anything.

39:07.360 --> 39:11.560
But… I think I know
who it might have been.

39:11.640 --> 39:12.640
Who?

39:13.280 --> 39:14.760
Give me a name, and I'll let you go.

39:19.800 --> 39:21.000
João Vidal.

39:22.840 --> 39:24.040
He's an engineer.

39:24.600 --> 39:28.760
He was with me in the studio.
I'm sure he switched the reel.

39:40.720 --> 39:45.400
She ratted on one of ours.
There was no other choice.
