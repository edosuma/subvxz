WEBVTT

00:39.972 --> 00:41.707
I didn't know you very well.

00:41.740 --> 00:44.343
We only knew each other
for a short time,

00:44.375 --> 00:46.345
but it was a really nice time.

00:48.581 --> 00:51.084
That period of time
we spent together,

00:54.152 --> 00:58.625
it was a really nice time.

01:08.900 --> 01:13.772
Oh, my God. It's fucking over.

01:17.843 --> 01:20.847
It's over. It's over.
It's over. It's over.

01:25.918 --> 01:28.354
It's over. It's over!

01:28.387 --> 01:30.656
It's fucking over!

01:33.492 --> 01:35.594
I'm fucking dying.

01:35.628 --> 01:37.463
You don't get it.
You don't understand!

01:39.932 --> 01:43.203
I'm not fucking crazy.
I'm not crazy!

01:44.903 --> 01:46.805
Please understand,
I'm not crazy.

01:48.807 --> 01:50.343
We had a time.

01:52.545 --> 01:55.748
We had a time,
but it's over now.

01:57.615 --> 01:59.152
There's no tomorrow.

02:00.451 --> 02:01.754
There's no tomorrow.

02:04.956 --> 02:06.859
I'm not fucking crazy!

05:52.517 --> 05:54.387
<i>Hi, how's the new house?</i>

05:54.420 --> 05:55.987
It's good.

05:56.021 --> 05:58.491
<i>I think it's so great
that you own a house.</i>

05:58.524 --> 06:00.526
<i>This is the best thing
you could have done.</i>

06:00.559 --> 06:02.528
- Yeah.
- <i>Yeah. It's... Hello?</i>

06:02.560 --> 06:04.729
<i>Wait, did you just say
something? 'Cause I can't...</i>

06:04.762 --> 06:05.897
Can you come over?

06:05.930 --> 06:07.899
<i>Ugh, I can't.</i>

06:07.932 --> 06:10.034
<i>I'm supposed to go to my
sister-in-law's birthday party,</i>

06:10.067 --> 06:11.669
<i>but I really don't want to go.</i>

06:11.702 --> 06:13.037
<i>I just really want to
stay at home</i>

06:13.071 --> 06:14.173
<i>because she
fucking hates me.</i>

06:14.206 --> 06:15.475
Okay.

06:16.708 --> 06:18.177
<i>What did you just say?</i>

06:18.209 --> 06:21.447
<i>Hold on. Are you
speaking into the phone?</i>

06:21.480 --> 06:23.449
<i>I can barely hear you.
Are you okay?</i>

06:24.615 --> 06:25.850
Not really.

06:25.884 --> 06:27.653
<i>Oh, shit, Amy.</i>

06:27.685 --> 06:30.488
<i>I'll come over, if I can, okay?</i>

06:30.521 --> 06:31.689
Okay.

06:31.723 --> 06:33.658
<i>Look, just pause.</i>

06:33.692 --> 06:35.761
<i>Don't do anything
you might regret.</i>

06:35.793 --> 06:39.031
<i>Go for a walk or why don't you
try watching a movie?</i>

06:39.064 --> 06:40.967
A movie's an hour and a half.

06:42.634 --> 06:45.605
<i>I heard hour and... what?</i>

06:46.971 --> 06:49.140
<i>An hour and a half... what?</i>

06:49.173 --> 06:52.210
<i>Are you laying down and
talking into the phone?</i>

06:52.244 --> 06:55.114
<i>Hello? I cannot understand you.</i>

06:55.146 --> 06:58.617
<i>Can you talk into the phone?</i>

06:58.649 --> 07:01.152
<i>Oh, my gosh. Wait, I'm getting
a text from my brother, now.</i>

07:01.185 --> 07:04.189
<i>Bring salad? Bring... I don't
even want to go to this party.</i>

07:06.891 --> 07:08.560
<i>I'm just terrible
at making salads.</i>

07:10.262 --> 07:13.132
<i>Look, they sprang this stuff
on me at the last second</i>

07:13.165 --> 07:15.634
<i>and she doesn't even like me
when I go over there.</i>

07:15.666 --> 07:18.670
<i>She's just mean to me. I don't
know... I don't know what I did.</i>

13:06.183 --> 13:07.285
Fuck.

16:22.113 --> 16:23.382
Amy?

17:43.894 --> 17:45.230
Amy!

17:54.705 --> 17:56.140
Hey, Jane.

17:58.809 --> 18:00.578
What is going on?

18:01.778 --> 18:03.481
Come on down from there.

18:04.816 --> 18:06.485
I was thinking...

18:09.386 --> 18:11.690
I could be made
into a leather jacket.

18:19.530 --> 18:21.465
This used to be alive.

18:21.499 --> 18:24.702
And now I just walk on it
and don't even think twice.

18:26.203 --> 18:28.573
But in death, it
becomes useful, you know?

18:30.407 --> 18:31.842
I want to be useful in death.

18:31.875 --> 18:33.310
Here, drink that.

18:33.344 --> 18:34.680
I don't want that.

18:37.548 --> 18:39.684
But I am telling you

18:41.352 --> 18:43.188
because I want you

18:43.221 --> 18:45.723
to make sure it happens
when I die.

18:47.357 --> 18:49.694
You are going to die
if you keep relapsing.

18:51.328 --> 18:53.164
That's not what's happening.

18:57.969 --> 19:00.238
But I am drinking, so that's...

19:01.806 --> 19:04.276
technically a relapse.

19:04.308 --> 19:05.711
Yeah, but...

19:08.313 --> 19:11.550
it doesn't matter.

19:14.719 --> 19:16.288
Tell me you'll take care of it.

19:17.788 --> 19:20.858
Nobody is turning you
into a leather jacket.

19:20.892 --> 19:22.693
You're not making sense.

19:22.727 --> 19:25.364
You're not thinking straight
because you are loaded.

19:27.464 --> 19:28.567
Look at me.

19:30.234 --> 19:31.336
Look at me.

19:35.606 --> 19:37.509
I...

19:37.541 --> 19:40.511
am going to die tomorrow.

19:40.545 --> 19:42.581
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

19:42.614 --> 19:44.649
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

19:44.682 --> 19:46.750
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

19:46.784 --> 19:47.852
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

19:47.884 --> 19:48.987
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

19:49.019 --> 19:50.288
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

19:50.320 --> 19:52.256
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

19:53.490 --> 19:54.725
It's okay.

19:54.759 --> 19:56.228
No, you're not.

19:56.260 --> 19:57.628
It's not okay.

19:58.930 --> 20:00.599
It just is.

20:04.801 --> 20:05.870
So...

20:09.507 --> 20:11.743
Tomorrow is another day.

20:11.776 --> 20:14.580
I can't sit here and
watch you get wasted.

20:15.813 --> 20:17.315
I won't be held hostage.

20:17.347 --> 20:21.452
So, I am going to leave

20:21.486 --> 20:24.022
and you're going to
call me tomorrow.

20:24.055 --> 20:26.490
There is no tomorrow for me.

20:27.991 --> 20:30.596
I have to let go, oh, my God.
You know this.

20:31.628 --> 20:32.730
There's a guy

20:34.565 --> 20:35.866
in Denmark.

20:37.501 --> 20:38.903
He's a leather worker, I want...

20:38.935 --> 20:41.372
No. Stop.

20:41.405 --> 20:42.707
Goodbye.

21:07.932 --> 21:08.967
Hmm?

21:45.603 --> 21:46.705
Hello?

21:49.574 --> 21:50.942
Hello? Hello?

23:00.010 --> 23:01.946
<i>Was I dreaming?</i>

23:59.971 --> 24:02.707
So, this is gonna be
the spare bedroom,

24:02.740 --> 24:05.576
but I have to
finish wallpapering.

24:05.609 --> 24:08.212
'Cause the previous owners
had it this sort of

24:08.246 --> 24:11.483
babyish blue nursery color.

24:13.250 --> 24:14.752
Extra storage.

24:17.054 --> 24:18.990
Good to have.

24:19.022 --> 24:21.592
And this is the bedroom...

24:23.661 --> 24:25.630
That's a big TV.

24:27.731 --> 24:30.634
What, about 50 inches?

24:30.667 --> 24:32.636
I don't know, it was
the previous owners.

24:32.670 --> 24:34.072
They just left that TV?

24:34.105 --> 24:35.507
Yeah.

24:35.539 --> 24:36.974
You wanna watch something?

24:37.008 --> 24:38.675
I don't know if it works.

24:38.709 --> 24:40.812
You
haven't tried to turn it on?

24:40.845 --> 24:42.180
No.

24:42.212 --> 24:43.714
I don't really watch TV.

24:45.650 --> 24:46.718
Fair enough.

24:48.952 --> 24:50.087
That's a big bed.

24:51.655 --> 24:54.259
You know, I actually
do really regret

24:54.291 --> 24:56.026
not going to Majorca
one summer

24:56.059 --> 24:58.028
because I was trying to
win over an ex-girlfriend.

24:58.061 --> 24:59.296
Oh, that's sad.

24:59.329 --> 25:01.698
I had the whole thing
planned out.

25:01.731 --> 25:03.768
That's actually a tragedy.

25:03.800 --> 25:05.903
That's a true regret,

25:05.936 --> 25:07.237
if we're being honest.

25:07.270 --> 25:08.673
That's bad.

25:08.705 --> 25:10.073
What about you?

25:10.106 --> 25:11.876
How you doing
in the regret department?

25:13.810 --> 25:15.779
- Truth only.
- Okay.

25:17.347 --> 25:18.916
Um...

25:18.950 --> 25:20.884
Go.

25:20.917 --> 25:24.822
I regret not knowing
how to make an omelet.

25:26.123 --> 25:28.226
I wouldn't say that's a regret.

25:28.259 --> 25:30.127
I mean, I've tried really hard

25:30.161 --> 25:32.931
and failed really hard.

25:32.963 --> 25:35.232
Okay, fine. Next.

25:35.266 --> 25:37.602
Skip.

25:37.634 --> 25:40.904
It just takes a very tiny
amount of my brain space,

25:40.938 --> 25:43.107
but it's something.

25:43.140 --> 25:46.011
I terminated a pregnancy
when I was 22.

25:52.215 --> 25:53.284
Terminated?

25:54.384 --> 25:56.220
I mean, I had an abortion.

25:56.252 --> 25:58.655
I know, just the term.

25:58.689 --> 26:00.758
I didn't really...
I hadn't thought about it

26:00.790 --> 26:02.126
until I bought this house.

26:04.996 --> 26:07.765
You hadn't thought about...
what, the kid?

26:07.798 --> 26:10.367
Well, it's not a kid.

26:10.401 --> 26:13.638
It's a bunch of cells
in my uterus, but...

26:15.138 --> 26:16.273
Um...

26:18.174 --> 26:20.110
Yeah, I hadn't
thought about the kid

26:20.144 --> 26:21.813
until I bought the house.

26:27.284 --> 26:29.020
Do you regret it?

26:36.794 --> 26:37.996
Don't answer that.

26:39.896 --> 26:41.665
No, I don't.

26:44.734 --> 26:47.004
I don't regret it. I mean,
I probably wouldn't have

26:47.038 --> 26:49.039
been able to buy this house
if I'd had it.

26:53.443 --> 26:57.115
I don't know why
I'm reacting like this.

26:57.147 --> 26:58.949
No, I don't regret it.

27:07.290 --> 27:09.326
What do you say we
figure out that TV, now?

27:09.359 --> 27:11.295
Sorry.

27:57.307 --> 27:58.910
<i>What? I thought you said</i>

27:58.942 --> 28:00.278
<i>you were gonna
bring the salad?</i>

28:00.310 --> 28:01.846
I know, but if I come,

28:01.878 --> 28:03.380
I'm just gonna be distracted

28:03.413 --> 28:05.415
and I just want to sit
and play with these ideas.

28:05.449 --> 28:08.052
You know I can't control
when inspiration strikes.

28:08.085 --> 28:09.886
I'm just gonna annoy Susan,
anyway.

28:09.920 --> 28:12.457
Look, I'll take you guys
to dinner tomorrow,

28:12.490 --> 28:15.192
or whenever.

28:15.226 --> 28:17.795
Tell Susan I said
happy birthday, okay?

28:17.827 --> 28:19.062
<i>Of course, I will.</i>

28:19.096 --> 28:20.330
<i>Will you call me tomorrow?</i>

28:20.364 --> 28:22.133
Yeah, okay. Love you, bye.

29:18.588 --> 29:20.191
Oh, no way.

29:24.929 --> 29:26.297
No, no, hold it. Hold it.

29:29.232 --> 29:30.400
Got it.

29:32.536 --> 29:33.805
Wow.

29:41.511 --> 29:42.547
Wow, this is...

31:14.070 --> 31:15.238
Amy, are you there?

31:15.271 --> 31:16.539
Goddammit, unlock the door.

31:18.308 --> 31:20.176
All right. Amy, I'm really
freaking out right now

31:20.210 --> 31:22.212
because all that stuff
you were saying earlier.

31:22.246 --> 31:23.547
What were you talking about?

31:23.579 --> 31:25.215
And I can't...
Like, now,

31:25.249 --> 31:26.983
I don't know where you are

31:27.017 --> 31:29.586
or what is going on.

33:08.484 --> 33:09.553
Amy?

33:19.163 --> 33:20.765
<i>Hey, it's Amy.</i>

33:20.798 --> 33:22.665
<i>Leave a message
or text if it's important.</i>

33:23.834 --> 33:25.568
Yeah, hi, uh...

33:25.602 --> 33:28.105
I feel like you put this idea
of dying in my head

33:28.137 --> 33:30.607
and now I'm paranoid and
you're not calling me back.

33:30.641 --> 33:32.744
Can you just call me back?

33:34.577 --> 33:36.580
And I broke in your house.

34:00.703 --> 34:03.139
We're on vacation in the Keys.

34:03.173 --> 34:04.708
It's gorgeous
and I'm in the water.

34:04.740 --> 34:06.277
I got the snorkel gear on.

34:06.309 --> 34:08.112
- We were on one of those
- You okay?

34:08.144 --> 34:09.480
- snorkel tours...
- I'm fine.

34:09.512 --> 34:11.347
and she refuses
to get in the water.

34:11.380 --> 34:13.283
- She wouldn't come in.
- No, I'm telling you,

34:13.317 --> 34:16.253
you guys,
dolphins are down to fuck.

34:16.286 --> 34:19.322
- Oh, God, here we go.
- DTF all the time.

34:19.356 --> 34:21.425
This is her new kick, okay?

34:21.458 --> 34:23.561
I'm curious
what you think of it.

34:23.594 --> 34:25.663
I am obsessed
with the idea that...

34:27.530 --> 34:29.199
Are you expecting someone?

34:29.233 --> 34:30.601
No, I'm not expecting anyone.

34:30.634 --> 34:32.202
Did you get me a stripper
this year?

34:32.235 --> 34:33.670
I should have done that.

34:33.704 --> 34:36.106
Baby, one year
you have to get me a stripper!

34:37.206 --> 34:38.409
He always threatens it...

34:38.442 --> 34:39.643
Hey.

34:39.675 --> 34:41.177
I thought you weren't coming.

34:41.210 --> 34:43.513
No, but then I decided to come.

34:43.547 --> 34:45.115
Okay.

34:45.148 --> 34:46.349
I missed you.

34:46.382 --> 34:47.684
Oh, I missed you, too.

34:47.717 --> 34:49.219
- No, I missed...
- You okay?

34:49.253 --> 34:50.554
Yeah. No, I'm good. I'm good.

34:50.586 --> 34:52.222
Oh, you put these up.

34:52.255 --> 34:54.190
Yeah. Well, we love
what you do. We love you.

34:54.224 --> 34:56.260
- I love you, too.
- Why are you in your pajamas?

34:56.293 --> 34:57.461
Yes. Well, they're floral.

34:59.862 --> 35:01.397
I don't want to go in.

35:01.431 --> 35:02.566
Is your wrist okay?

35:02.599 --> 35:04.235
I gotta go see Madison.

35:04.268 --> 35:06.302
- I got to go see Madison.
- Madison's sleeping.

35:06.335 --> 35:08.771
- She's always happy to see me.
- Yes, but she's sleeping.

35:08.804 --> 35:11.509
- What happened to your wrist?
- I don't know. I don't know.

35:11.541 --> 35:13.177
Hi, Susan.

35:13.210 --> 35:14.545
Hello, Jane.

35:14.577 --> 35:15.913
It's her birthday, so.

35:15.945 --> 35:17.914
Happy... Happy birthday.

35:17.947 --> 35:19.782
She just... She came.

35:19.815 --> 35:21.384
Yes, I can see.

35:21.418 --> 35:23.420
It's Jane.
Jane is here, everyone.

35:23.452 --> 35:26.322
Jane, I'm so happy
you could make it.

35:26.356 --> 35:28.225
Thought inspiration struck.

35:28.257 --> 35:30.226
Let's go in and say hi
to everybody. Okay?

35:30.260 --> 35:32.396
- I'll go say hi.
- You're just in time for cake.

35:32.429 --> 35:35.298
I do. I love...
I love cake.

35:35.331 --> 35:36.766
Awesome, we're gonna have some.

35:36.800 --> 35:38.836
She loves cake.

35:38.869 --> 35:40.771
This is Jane.

35:40.804 --> 35:42.639
I told you about
Brian and Tilly?

35:42.672 --> 35:44.240
- Hi.
- Have a seat.

35:44.273 --> 35:45.643
Susan was just
telling us about

35:45.675 --> 35:47.944
her fascination
with dolphin fucking.

35:47.978 --> 35:50.380
Oh, where you going? Sit down.

35:51.547 --> 35:53.416
Take a seat. It's cool.

35:53.449 --> 35:54.918
Anyways,

35:54.952 --> 35:58.355
yes, dolphins are
like sex maniacs.

35:58.387 --> 35:59.889
You guys, I'm not kidding you.

35:59.922 --> 36:01.391
Dolphins.

36:01.425 --> 36:03.227
They will fuck all the time.

36:03.260 --> 36:05.396
They fuck around
with porpoises,

36:05.429 --> 36:07.731
with baby dolphins...

36:07.764 --> 36:09.365
Sometimes they'll just kill it.

36:09.398 --> 36:11.402
- I mean, it's wild!
- Oh, my gosh!

36:11.434 --> 36:13.670
They've been known
to trap other dolphins in caves

36:13.704 --> 36:16.440
to rape them.
I can't even!

36:16.472 --> 36:18.375
Do you know,
I just read the other day

36:18.407 --> 36:20.743
that they will
bump into puffer fish

36:20.777 --> 36:22.479
because they'll get high.

36:22.512 --> 36:24.715
You can get high from
bumping into a puffer fish.

36:24.748 --> 36:27.585
Wow. That's a new fun fact
that I haven't heard.

36:27.617 --> 36:30.453
I knew their dicks
could grab things,

36:30.487 --> 36:32.822
but I didn't know they
get high off of puffer fish.

36:32.856 --> 36:34.525
You love that.

36:34.557 --> 36:37.527
No, they get high

36:37.561 --> 36:39.930
- off of bumping into things?
- Yes!

36:39.963 --> 36:42.566
Yes, I'm saying that dolphins,

36:42.599 --> 36:45.402
they are, pretty much,
just like us.

36:45.434 --> 36:47.837
Oh, Susan!

36:47.871 --> 36:49.706
They are!

36:49.739 --> 36:53.376
Okay, I'm sorry, that's
not exactly what I want

36:53.409 --> 36:55.245
and how I want to
live my life,

36:55.278 --> 36:57.380
but we have similarities.

36:57.414 --> 36:59.316
Right? It's human nature.

36:59.349 --> 37:02.019
Doesn't, Michael Jackson have
that song called Human Nature?

37:02.052 --> 37:04.021
Yes, he does. Madonna...

37:04.054 --> 37:05.389
And Boyz II Men.

37:05.422 --> 37:06.923
Love Boyz II Men.

37:06.956 --> 37:09.393
Actually, I think
it's really interesting,

37:09.425 --> 37:10.693
about the dolphins.

37:10.726 --> 37:13.663
I like you. She's great.

37:13.697 --> 37:15.566
She's great, Brian. Good job.

37:17.300 --> 37:18.635
Yeah, she's great.

37:21.405 --> 37:23.574
I didn't realize dolphins
were so interesting.

37:23.606 --> 37:25.309
I know. I know!

37:25.342 --> 37:29.380
They are really humans
without society.

37:29.413 --> 37:31.014
- Jane?
- Yes?

37:31.047 --> 37:34.584
What's your take on
the whole dolphin-fucking thing

37:34.617 --> 37:36.719
and how we're
not so different than fish?

37:36.753 --> 37:38.455
- Uh...
- No, baby,

37:38.487 --> 37:40.023
dolphins are not fish.

37:40.056 --> 37:41.791
Okay, so Jane and I

37:41.824 --> 37:45.461
very rarely agree on anything,
but I actually think

37:45.494 --> 37:47.897
we might be
on the same page on this one.

37:47.931 --> 37:50.701
You spend all your days

37:50.733 --> 37:52.702
looking deep
into your microscope,

37:52.735 --> 37:54.637
looking at these
small images saying,

37:54.670 --> 37:57.540
"Oh, this flower
is a universe,"

37:57.574 --> 38:01.811
and I'm just saying that
dolphins are human-like

38:01.844 --> 38:03.646
and we're all the same, right?

38:03.679 --> 38:04.781
We're all the same.

38:04.815 --> 38:06.884
Humans are the only animal

38:08.617 --> 38:12.690
or creature that
pretends to be what it's not.

38:12.722 --> 38:15.492
Albert Camus said that,
I think. I Googled it.

38:18.994 --> 38:21.331
- I like that quote.
- That's a good one.

38:21.364 --> 38:23.767
- Thank you, Jane.
- Wow, we have a reader.

38:25.135 --> 38:26.670
She's something, huh?

38:26.702 --> 38:27.871
She is.

38:31.708 --> 38:34.811
I just...
We're all gonna die.

38:34.844 --> 38:37.747
I just think we should be able
to talk about it, right?

38:39.449 --> 38:40.483
I mean, I'm dying to know.

38:40.516 --> 38:41.951
She's funny, right?

38:41.985 --> 38:43.954
- Wow.
- No, she's joking.

38:43.987 --> 38:46.356
- She's just joking around.
- You don't have to humor her.

38:46.389 --> 38:48.358
- You're joking.
- Well,

38:48.391 --> 38:51.427
it's like, I just
have this feeling,

38:51.460 --> 38:52.995
the way that you know

38:53.028 --> 38:56.532
when you're about to
get a cold the next day

38:56.565 --> 38:58.134
and it just hasn't hit yet?

38:58.168 --> 39:00.771
I know that's
what is happening.

39:00.804 --> 39:02.539
I'm going to die tomorrow.

39:02.572 --> 39:04.474
But how do you know?

39:04.507 --> 39:06.442
I don't know. I just know.

39:06.476 --> 39:08.445
So, you know it
or you don't know it?

39:09.646 --> 39:12.516
Well, I know that I don't know.

39:12.548 --> 39:16.420
but I know
I don't want to be alone

39:16.452 --> 39:19.722
and I know that I'm
going to die tomorrow.

39:19.755 --> 39:21.557
- Well, if you...
- I know

39:21.590 --> 39:23.626
that I'm going to
die tomorrow.

39:23.659 --> 39:25.027
But you don't know.

39:25.061 --> 39:26.797
I know that I'm
going to die tomorrow.

39:26.829 --> 39:30.768
I know that I'm going to die.

39:32.835 --> 39:36.039
Okay, great. So,
you don't know, right?

39:37.206 --> 39:39.742
I know that it's my birthday

39:39.775 --> 39:41.944
and I want to talk about
dolphin fucking.

39:41.978 --> 39:43.947
It's all I want to talk about
tonight.

39:43.980 --> 39:45.581
I don't want to
talk about death

39:45.614 --> 39:47.050
because I am
not that old yet.

39:48.184 --> 39:49.552
Okay. You know what?

39:49.585 --> 39:51.087
Why don't I go into the kitchen

39:51.121 --> 39:53.423
to get that special thing
for the birthday girl?

39:53.456 --> 39:55.925
No, no, don't go now, Jason.
Just stay, now.

39:55.958 --> 39:58.728
What?
Go get my cake.

40:00.130 --> 40:02.166
I'm gonna go get the cake.

40:02.199 --> 40:04.034
Oh, my God.

40:04.067 --> 40:07.070
I'm sorry, Susan. It's just...

40:07.103 --> 40:11.809
something's just terribly wrong
and I just have to say it.

40:11.842 --> 40:14.077
I'm going to die tomorrow.
I'm dying.

40:14.110 --> 40:15.979
Jane, we heard you.

40:16.012 --> 40:18.682
- I'm dying.
- I heard you! Okay?

40:18.715 --> 40:19.950
You are doing

40:19.983 --> 40:21.218
what you always do,

40:21.251 --> 40:23.921
which is make everything
about you.

40:23.954 --> 40:27.758
It's all about you, Jane,
all the fucking time.

40:27.791 --> 40:30.727
You sit alone
in that room of yours

40:30.760 --> 40:32.963
taking pictures
of God knows what,

40:32.996 --> 40:35.932
because you can't hold
a normal fucking job.

40:35.965 --> 40:39.001
The only reason I tolerate you

40:39.034 --> 40:40.937
is to make Jason happy.

40:40.971 --> 40:43.507
And I pray to God,
every fucking day,

40:43.539 --> 40:45.576
that my sweet daughter
does not have

40:45.608 --> 40:49.712
whatever gene this is
that makes you this way.

40:51.547 --> 40:55.751
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

40:57.853 --> 41:01.491
- I just thought for a second,
- <i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

41:01.525 --> 41:03.594
when the lights went out,
that that was it.

41:03.626 --> 41:08.931
- Do you know? Is that it?
- <i>♪ Happy birthday, dear Susan ♪</i>

41:08.965 --> 41:14.637
- Did we... I think that it...
- <i>♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪</i>

41:19.009 --> 41:20.510
Are we already dead?

41:22.045 --> 41:24.181
Did Jason ever tell you

41:24.213 --> 41:27.016
about the time that we had to
take her on vacation with us?

41:27.050 --> 41:28.752
Uh-huh. Yeah.

41:28.784 --> 41:30.286
She didn't want
to be left alone,

41:30.320 --> 41:32.722
- so we took her. She got lost.
- It's okay.

41:32.755 --> 41:35.658
I feel that way all the time,
like I'm going to die tomorrow

41:35.692 --> 41:37.594
and I got to get
everything done today.

41:37.626 --> 41:39.096
No. I <i>know.</i>

41:39.128 --> 41:41.764
That feeling is
just paralyzing.

41:41.797 --> 41:44.667
But it's really gonna happen
for me.

41:47.036 --> 41:49.739
What are you talking about?
You don't know that.

41:49.773 --> 41:52.108
Yeah, I do. I know it.
I mean, just like I know

41:52.141 --> 41:54.310
if I drop this,
it's going to break.

41:55.911 --> 41:57.580
For fuck's sake, Jason!

41:57.614 --> 41:58.882
Mom?

41:58.914 --> 42:00.317
I know she's your sister,

42:00.349 --> 42:02.085
but she has got to go!

42:06.056 --> 42:07.191
Mom?

42:39.121 --> 42:41.692
Get the fuck away from me,
Jane!

42:50.634 --> 42:52.635
Jane, man.

42:52.668 --> 42:55.271
She's crazy, right?

42:58.708 --> 43:00.277
I don't think she's that crazy.

43:03.045 --> 43:04.614
She could be right.

43:06.181 --> 43:07.216
What?

43:09.219 --> 43:11.387
I mean, consider for a second
that she's right.

43:11.420 --> 43:13.623
We all have to die
at some point.

43:14.990 --> 43:16.126
Why not tomorrow?

43:18.193 --> 43:19.228
Yeah.

43:22.898 --> 43:24.999
Yeah.

43:25.300 --> 43:27.637
Yeah. Yeah.

43:30.673 --> 43:32.742
Do you want to get a drink
somewhere else?

43:32.775 --> 43:34.010
Yes, I do.

43:35.445 --> 43:37.715
Just say, for instance,

43:38.914 --> 43:41.117
that Jane is right.

43:42.851 --> 43:46.922
Why are you always
making excuses for your sister?

43:46.956 --> 43:48.258
Just listen to me.

43:48.291 --> 43:50.427
I listened to you about
dolphin fucking.

43:50.460 --> 43:52.396
Just listen.

43:54.030 --> 43:55.932
Fine.

43:58.268 --> 44:00.070
We're all gonna die
at some point.

44:00.103 --> 44:02.105
Yeah, no shit.

44:02.137 --> 44:04.807
We are going to die.
I'm gonna die.

44:10.880 --> 44:12.416
I could die tomorrow.

44:46.983 --> 44:49.153
I'm gonna die tomorrow.

45:17.880 --> 45:19.348
I'm gonna die tomorrow.

45:22.918 --> 45:24.187
I'm gonna die tomorrow.

45:25.554 --> 45:28.023
I'm gonna die tomorrow.

45:28.056 --> 45:29.792
I'm gonna die tomorrow.

45:30.893 --> 45:36.232
I'm gonna die tomorrow.

45:49.278 --> 45:52.481
Susan? Susan?

45:52.514 --> 45:55.551
- Susan! Susan!
- Oh, God, I'm gonna die.

45:55.585 --> 45:59.389
I need to go to the hospital.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.103
I love you, Pop.

46:36.492 --> 46:38.161
- Hey.
- Hey.

46:38.193 --> 46:39.563
- Mom?
- It's okay.

46:39.596 --> 46:41.398
Dad?

46:41.431 --> 46:43.166
It's okay, it's okay.

46:43.199 --> 46:45.235
It's okay, everything's
gonna be okay.

46:46.402 --> 46:47.538
Why are you crying?

46:49.304 --> 46:51.875
It's okay, it's okay.

46:53.141 --> 46:54.277
Are you drunk?

46:54.309 --> 46:56.145
Yes, a little bit.

46:58.414 --> 47:02.286
I'm gonna die tomorrow.
And so is your dad.

47:07.222 --> 47:09.159
I should have done this
for him sooner.

47:15.197 --> 47:18.999
I was waiting for him to die
to break up with you.

47:19.501 --> 47:22.972
I mean, I was gonna
give it three months.

47:23.005 --> 47:24.907
I didn't want to be an asshole.

47:29.244 --> 47:30.980
We weren't gonna last anyway.

47:33.682 --> 47:36.586
I don't want to die. Mom!

47:38.253 --> 47:41.123
Mom, I don't want to die now.

47:41.157 --> 47:42.626
She did this to us.

47:44.927 --> 47:46.462
Who?

47:46.496 --> 47:47.898
Your sister.

47:49.065 --> 47:51.300
Not only is she killing us,

47:51.333 --> 47:53.302
she's killing her.

47:53.335 --> 47:55.504
She's killing Madison.

47:58.708 --> 48:01.411
What do you wanna do?

48:03.146 --> 48:04.414
You know.

48:09.385 --> 48:10.553
Okay.

48:17.559 --> 48:20.130
<i>There's no nd
to leave a message.</i>

48:24.701 --> 48:27.070
Amy, please, call me back.

48:27.103 --> 48:29.972
What the hell is that message?
What are you talking about?

48:30.005 --> 48:31.473
I know you know
what is going on

48:31.507 --> 48:33.376
and you've left me
all alone with this.

48:33.409 --> 48:36.646
Please. Amy, please, please!

48:36.679 --> 48:38.648
You're my friend, call me back.

48:42.117 --> 48:44.286
Hey, it's Amy.

48:44.320 --> 48:45.989
I won't be around tomorrow.

48:47.657 --> 48:50.494
Or any day after that, but
feel free to leave a message.

48:57.400 --> 48:59.302
<i>Hey, it's Amy.</i>

48:59.335 --> 49:01.170
<i>I won't be around tomorrow.</i>

49:03.106 --> 49:05.976
<i>Or any day after that, but
feel free to leave a message.</i>

49:13.349 --> 49:15.552
There's no need
to leave a message.

49:15.585 --> 49:17.454
All right, let's do it!

49:20.056 --> 49:22.125
Do I have to wear the helmet?

49:22.157 --> 49:25.027
Uh, yeah. Definitely very
important to wear the helmet.

49:25.061 --> 49:26.696
You know, these things
look like big toys,

49:26.728 --> 49:28.397
but at the end of the day,

49:28.431 --> 49:30.666
if you hit anything too fast
and too straight on,

49:30.699 --> 49:33.369
this thing can flip
right the fuck over.

49:33.402 --> 49:35.304
Well, I'm gonna die anyway.

49:39.242 --> 49:40.344
I mean...

49:44.480 --> 49:47.083
not here. I mean,
not on my watch.

49:48.451 --> 49:49.485
Right.

49:50.719 --> 49:52.555
But I'm definitely gonna
die tomorrow.

50:00.496 --> 50:02.599
Umm...

50:15.110 --> 50:17.446
I can't hear anything.

50:18.847 --> 50:20.083
Okay.

50:21.416 --> 50:24.353
But I'm dying tomorrow.

50:28.523 --> 50:29.826
Please.

50:29.858 --> 50:31.827
Look...

50:31.860 --> 50:34.696
I don't think that
anything is wrong with you,

50:34.730 --> 50:37.166
but if you're worried about
catching something,

50:37.199 --> 50:40.602
I could easily give you
some antibiotics or...

50:40.635 --> 50:42.538
No, I don't need antibiotics.

50:44.273 --> 50:46.576
You know when you're
on a highway, you know,

50:46.608 --> 50:48.644
and there's a semi
truck up ahead of you

50:48.677 --> 50:51.447
and you know, I have to
speed up and get past that

50:51.481 --> 50:53.316
before something
really bad happens?

50:53.349 --> 50:55.718
That's what's going on.

50:55.751 --> 50:58.388
Or when you're
walking in New York City...

50:58.420 --> 51:00.489
Have you been to New York City?

51:03.559 --> 51:05.662
Yes, I've been
to New York City.

51:05.695 --> 51:07.664
Right, so in the summer,
when you look up

51:07.697 --> 51:09.633
and there's air conditioners
everywhere, and...

51:11.300 --> 51:13.635
you just know one of those
is going to pop out

51:13.668 --> 51:15.271
and crash down on my head.

51:18.340 --> 51:20.576
Or like, when you lock up
everything at night,

51:20.610 --> 51:23.613
I mean, you make sure
everything's locked,

51:23.646 --> 51:25.348
but then

51:25.380 --> 51:30.353
you just know something
really bad is gonna happen.

51:30.385 --> 51:33.188
And then you lay down
finally to go to sleep,

51:33.222 --> 51:36.426
but then you imagine this guy,
and his friends,

51:36.458 --> 51:38.494
and they're coming...

51:38.527 --> 51:42.464
not just to take
everything that you have,

51:42.498 --> 51:44.867
but to rape you, and kill you.

51:44.900 --> 51:47.870
And not just rape you,
but taunt you

51:47.903 --> 51:51.240
so, kind of, mercilessly

51:51.273 --> 51:55.244
that you're going to have to
beg for your own...

52:55.237 --> 52:56.940
Do you ever ride a dune buggy?

52:56.972 --> 52:58.440
No.

52:58.474 --> 53:00.510
- You want to?
- Yes.

53:00.543 --> 53:02.378
We could go now,
you can make a U-turn.

53:02.411 --> 53:04.480
That's actually on
the schedule for tomorrow.

53:04.512 --> 53:06.548
Oh, there's a schedule,
that's very fun.

53:06.581 --> 53:08.717
A lot of people don't think
schedules are fun,

53:08.751 --> 53:10.753
but I'm glad to hear
you think they are,

53:10.786 --> 53:14.289
because to me,
that's a big part of my life.

53:40.815 --> 53:42.518
We're in.

53:42.550 --> 53:43.753
Hey.

53:44.987 --> 53:46.322
Good job.

53:54.563 --> 53:55.999
This place is nice.

54:03.873 --> 54:05.008
Wow.

54:09.878 --> 54:11.748
So, this is
your brother's place?

54:11.780 --> 54:13.682
Yeah, but he never uses it.

54:13.715 --> 54:14.984
It's great

54:26.695 --> 54:28.331
Back door,

54:28.364 --> 54:30.365
in case of an emergency.

54:30.398 --> 54:31.835
It's good to know your exits.

54:43.612 --> 54:46.081
I thought about buying
a place out here like this,

54:46.114 --> 54:48.817
but I don't know,
it felt too isolated.

54:48.851 --> 54:50.586
I like being isolated.

54:50.619 --> 54:52.021
I don't think
you have a choice,

54:54.389 --> 54:56.391
'cause you
don't have any friends.

54:56.425 --> 54:58.094
That's not very nice.

54:58.126 --> 54:59.895
What's wrong
with being isolated?

54:59.929 --> 55:01.530
Nothing.

55:01.563 --> 55:04.366
You know, I know you said
you didn't like TV,

55:04.400 --> 55:07.436
so I went ahead and removed
all of the televisions,

55:07.469 --> 55:10.105
in fact,
all the entertainment options,

55:10.139 --> 55:11.673
so it's just you and me.

55:11.706 --> 55:12.875
That's perfect.

55:18.914 --> 55:20.682
You mind if I get more wine?

55:20.715 --> 55:22.418
No, of course not.

55:22.451 --> 55:24.954
No? I don't want to make you
uncomfortable if you...

55:24.987 --> 55:26.822
That's fine,
just 'cause I don't drink

55:26.856 --> 55:28.358
doesn't mean you shouldn't.

55:29.791 --> 55:31.728
Can't argue with that.

55:49.844 --> 55:52.448
Are those for show or
do people actually shoot?

55:53.548 --> 55:54.684
We can shoot them.

55:56.552 --> 55:58.054
Do you like guns?

55:58.086 --> 55:59.121
Yeah.

56:00.556 --> 56:01.923
You wanna shoot some bottles?

56:01.956 --> 56:03.893
No.

56:03.925 --> 56:05.094
I don't like guns.

56:06.494 --> 56:07.896
Well, you don't have to.

56:07.929 --> 56:09.965
We can take that off schedule.

56:09.998 --> 56:11.666
Free up some time.

56:11.699 --> 56:12.935
To do what?

56:14.637 --> 56:16.139
Usually when I come out here,

56:16.172 --> 56:17.840
I just eat a bunch
of mushrooms.

56:17.873 --> 56:19.041
Oh.

56:20.876 --> 56:22.011
I'd do mushrooms.

56:23.179 --> 56:24.547
Yeah?

56:24.579 --> 56:25.882
Just not alcohol.

56:29.952 --> 56:31.020
Okay.

56:33.588 --> 56:35.858
I like that. You like that?

56:41.463 --> 56:43.666
Uh, do you have any eights?

56:43.699 --> 56:45.101
Go fish.

56:48.938 --> 56:50.539
Do you have any fives?

56:52.074 --> 56:53.976
You got a lot?

56:54.009 --> 56:55.945
You gotta have a five
in there, somewhere.

56:55.978 --> 56:58.014
- I don't. Go fish.
- Oh, my God.

57:00.615 --> 57:02.184
Um, do you have any eights?

57:02.217 --> 57:03.452
Did I just ask you that?

57:03.485 --> 57:04.719
I can't remember.

57:04.753 --> 57:06.456
Do you feel anything?

57:06.489 --> 57:09.791
Mmm... I guess colors
are a little bit brighter.

57:09.824 --> 57:12.828
But I don't, like,
see anything.

57:14.163 --> 57:15.731
Do you feel anything?

57:15.764 --> 57:17.599
Um...

57:17.632 --> 57:20.802
I'm seeing a bunch of diamonds
and hearts on these cards.

57:20.835 --> 57:23.004
I see them, too.

57:25.673 --> 57:27.744
- Pizza!
- I'll get it.

57:29.978 --> 57:31.681
Don't cheat.

57:42.291 --> 57:44.626
I have extra cash
if you need it.

57:51.000 --> 57:52.902
Is everything okay?

58:03.545 --> 58:04.646
Craig.

58:34.742 --> 58:36.112
Pizza!

58:48.856 --> 58:50.293
Is everything okay?

58:56.898 --> 58:57.967
What's wrong?

59:01.003 --> 59:02.639
November 25th.

59:04.940 --> 59:06.643
The day after tomorrow?

59:08.643 --> 59:12.581
What do we have to leave
a day early or something?

59:16.085 --> 59:17.887
It's fine.

59:17.920 --> 59:19.655
It's fine, everything's fine.

59:27.096 --> 59:28.597
Want some pizza?

59:45.246 --> 59:47.082
I can't believe it.

59:47.115 --> 59:48.217
I know.

1:00:00.829 --> 1:00:01.965
You wanna make out?

1:00:03.231 --> 1:00:04.333
Okay.

1:00:14.809 --> 1:00:16.378
Ah, I can't do this right now.

1:00:21.416 --> 1:00:22.918
Okay.

1:00:25.387 --> 1:00:26.689
Fuck.

1:00:31.092 --> 1:00:32.861
<i>You just think like,</i>

1:00:32.894 --> 1:00:34.262
<i>where am I gonna hide?</i>

1:00:34.295 --> 1:00:36.331
Everything's closet space.

1:00:36.364 --> 1:00:39.801
I should have
built a tunnel

1:00:39.835 --> 1:00:41.771
or like a lock or something.

1:00:43.172 --> 1:00:45.675
It's not really my specialty,

1:00:45.708 --> 1:00:46.942
but I could...

1:00:46.974 --> 1:00:48.777
I could refer you to...

1:00:51.112 --> 1:00:53.014
I could refer you
to a psychologist.

1:00:53.047 --> 1:00:54.983
It's just not really
my specialty.

1:00:56.719 --> 1:00:57.887
You all right?

1:01:00.856 --> 1:01:03.026
It's just, you're
really handsome and I...

1:01:14.802 --> 1:01:16.337
- What is it?
- Excuse me.

1:01:16.371 --> 1:01:17.907
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

1:01:19.875 --> 1:01:21.010
Wait, wait.

1:01:23.445 --> 1:01:24.747
What's happening?

1:01:24.780 --> 1:01:26.082
Oh, God, I don't know.

1:01:26.114 --> 1:01:28.049
What is it? Can I help?

1:01:30.753 --> 1:01:33.489
Oh! Oh, God!

1:01:35.891 --> 1:01:37.259
Oh!

1:01:37.291 --> 1:01:38.994
Shh, shh.

1:01:39.027 --> 1:01:40.730
My mother always
used to hum to me,

1:01:40.762 --> 1:01:42.264
would you hum
something for me?

1:01:44.500 --> 1:01:46.501
- Like that?
- Mm, yes, yes.

1:01:46.534 --> 1:01:47.969
Yes, exactly.

1:02:08.157 --> 1:02:09.192
I...

1:02:10.893 --> 1:02:12.028
I need to...

1:02:13.929 --> 1:02:15.798
I need to go be with my wife.

1:02:16.931 --> 1:02:18.266
You need to...

1:02:19.835 --> 1:02:21.336
Go!

1:04:19.253 --> 1:04:21.223
Hi.

1:04:26.161 --> 1:04:27.329
Oh, hello.

1:04:29.463 --> 1:04:30.498
No.

1:04:37.338 --> 1:04:39.608
No, I missed you.

1:04:41.043 --> 1:04:42.912
I miss you all the time.

1:04:45.146 --> 1:04:47.349
Taken a long time...

1:05:11.039 --> 1:05:12.642
Is this how it ends?

1:06:51.239 --> 1:06:53.541
I just came back
to see if this is real.

1:06:55.844 --> 1:06:57.146
If you were real.

1:06:59.380 --> 1:07:01.216
I still don't know
if it's real.

1:07:04.186 --> 1:07:05.554
I didn't know you very well.

1:07:05.586 --> 1:07:08.190
We only knew each other
for a short time.

1:07:08.222 --> 1:07:10.159
It was a really nice time.

1:07:12.427 --> 1:07:14.730
That period of time
that we spent together.

1:07:17.766 --> 1:07:19.168
It was a really...

1:07:20.601 --> 1:07:21.804
nice time.

1:10:31.693 --> 1:10:32.860
What are you doing?

1:10:34.362 --> 1:10:35.698
The sunrise.

1:10:39.833 --> 1:10:41.336
It's beautiful.

1:10:50.078 --> 1:10:51.614
Do you feel different?

1:10:53.581 --> 1:10:54.682
After what we did?

1:10:55.850 --> 1:10:57.853
No.

1:10:59.621 --> 1:11:00.855
No, I don't.

1:11:04.993 --> 1:11:06.362
Are you mad at me?

1:11:12.567 --> 1:11:13.702
What do you think?

1:11:16.537 --> 1:11:17.605
Okay.

1:11:23.978 --> 1:11:26.015
But it doesn't matter anymore.

1:11:28.783 --> 1:11:30.452
- Right?
- Yeah.

1:11:43.898 --> 1:11:45.534
I'll go make us some tea.

1:11:55.643 --> 1:11:57.346
I'm not mad at you.

1:12:00.047 --> 1:12:02.350
Kinda mad at myself

1:12:03.717 --> 1:12:05.688
for staying in
this relationship for...

1:12:08.422 --> 1:12:12.760
I don't know, six months
past its expiration date.

1:12:15.662 --> 1:12:18.933
You didn't even show up
to my birthday party.

1:12:20.568 --> 1:12:22.003
My dad had a stroke.

1:12:23.637 --> 1:12:26.975
Yeah, I understand.

1:12:31.712 --> 1:12:34.882
I just feel like if you
were really into me,

1:12:34.916 --> 1:12:35.984
you would have, like,

1:12:37.484 --> 1:12:39.520
texted to say
you weren't coming.

1:12:39.554 --> 1:12:41.590
We can stop
talking about this now.

1:12:45.726 --> 1:12:47.395
Should we wake her up?

1:12:50.198 --> 1:12:51.500
I don't know.

1:12:56.938 --> 1:12:57.972
No.

1:12:59.573 --> 1:13:00.641
No.

1:13:02.810 --> 1:13:05.747
It's better it happens
in her sleep.

1:13:13.755 --> 1:13:16.492
All the stupid things
they used to talk about.

1:13:17.926 --> 1:13:20.095
Stupid things
to be interested in.

1:13:23.131 --> 1:13:24.566
It was a waste of time.

1:13:43.551 --> 1:13:45.788
I liked those stupid things
you said.

1:14:03.270 --> 1:14:04.840
Should I open my presents?

1:14:08.877 --> 1:14:10.045
Yeah.

1:14:23.992 --> 1:14:26.061
I just wanted to
connect to someone.

1:14:28.630 --> 1:14:29.832
Or something.

1:14:40.542 --> 1:14:41.910
Who do you think lives here?

1:14:50.251 --> 1:14:51.552
It doesn't matter.

1:14:59.092 --> 1:15:03.998
Platypus, platypus

1:15:04.032 --> 1:15:06.902
it's always so fucking cute.

1:15:11.005 --> 1:15:15.176
It's so cute.

1:15:54.849 --> 1:15:56.585
Hi, I'm Jane.

1:15:58.118 --> 1:15:59.186
I'm dying.

1:16:00.688 --> 1:16:01.789
Hi.

1:16:03.190 --> 1:16:04.292
I'm Sky.

1:16:05.993 --> 1:16:07.728
I'm dying too.

1:16:10.765 --> 1:16:13.735
Hi, I'm Erin.

1:16:13.768 --> 1:16:16.037
I'm dying, too.

1:16:37.190 --> 1:16:38.961
Hey, can I swim in that pool?

1:16:47.034 --> 1:16:49.104
Do you think these ants
are gonna die?

1:16:51.773 --> 1:16:52.975
Of course.

1:16:54.274 --> 1:16:55.376
Everything is.

1:17:10.158 --> 1:17:13.061
Who's mowing their lawn
right now?

1:17:19.701 --> 1:17:21.336
I think I just got my period.

1:17:24.404 --> 1:17:26.041
It's my last...

1:17:26.073 --> 1:17:29.043
It's my last period.

1:17:33.980 --> 1:17:37.385
The women back in the day
used to sit in the streams.

1:17:40.188 --> 1:17:43.123
And the streams would
take away all the blood.

1:17:43.157 --> 1:17:45.960
- For like the whole...
- Tribe.

1:17:45.993 --> 1:17:49.197
And the women would get their
period at the same time, too.

1:17:49.229 --> 1:17:52.433
And, like, so when
the Spaniards came

1:17:52.466 --> 1:17:54.802
and would see
the rivers of blood,

1:17:54.836 --> 1:17:57.204
they would think, "Oh,
they're doing sacrifices."

1:17:59.073 --> 1:18:00.142
Weirdest thing.

1:18:01.475 --> 1:18:03.744
I love trees.
I'm gonna miss them.

1:18:03.778 --> 1:18:05.280
I'm gonna miss trees, too.

1:19:12.579 --> 1:19:13.948
Excuse me?

1:19:21.922 --> 1:19:23.358
Um...

1:19:23.390 --> 1:19:25.326
Do you do custom work?

1:19:30.398 --> 1:19:32.000
Like, if I were to bring you...

1:19:33.568 --> 1:19:34.802
a...

1:19:36.337 --> 1:19:38.807
a mammal, could you
make a leather jacket for me?

1:19:40.274 --> 1:19:43.978
I can assume that
you know the smell of death

1:19:44.011 --> 1:19:46.080
takes a while.

1:19:46.113 --> 1:19:48.115
It's something that you learn.

1:19:58.492 --> 1:20:00.929
We do do custom work.

1:20:00.962 --> 1:20:04.499
You have to bring in the skin
as soon as possible.

1:20:04.532 --> 1:20:06.234
It can't be rotting.

1:20:06.266 --> 1:20:09.136
And ideally, it would be good
if it was warm.

1:20:09.170 --> 1:20:11.038
- Okay?
- Uh-huh.

1:20:11.072 --> 1:20:14.876
If you bring the carcass in
and it's still warm,

1:20:14.908 --> 1:20:16.877
I can skin it,

1:20:16.911 --> 1:20:20.047
and then I will cure
it using a salt solution.

1:20:21.181 --> 1:20:23.518
When the salt solution is done,

1:20:23.551 --> 1:20:27.622
I will then take the hide and
hang it out in the sun to dry.

1:20:27.654 --> 1:20:30.524
It's a very long process.

1:20:30.557 --> 1:20:33.360
And it's up to you
to bring in the hide

1:20:33.394 --> 1:20:35.864
in the proper condition.
Do you understand?

1:20:35.896 --> 1:20:37.631
Uh-huh.

1:20:37.664 --> 1:20:40.601
If you bring it in that way, we
can make you whatever you like.

1:20:42.203 --> 1:20:44.172
What do you do
with the rest of the body?

1:21:12.065 --> 1:21:13.234
I'm okay.

1:21:16.703 --> 1:21:17.972
I'm okay.

1:21:21.975 --> 1:21:23.043
I'm okay.

1:21:30.551 --> 1:21:31.653
I'm ready.

1:21:57.278 --> 1:21:58.613
I'm not okay.

1:22:03.583 --> 1:22:04.985
I'm not okay.

1:22:09.023 --> 1:22:10.490
I'm not okay.

1:22:10.524 --> 1:22:13.261
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.

1:22:13.293 --> 1:22:14.695
I'm not okay.
