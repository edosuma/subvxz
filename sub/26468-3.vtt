04:58.380 --> 05:00.750
Do you even know
what registering is?

05:00.750 --> 05:02.750
You, literally, make
a list of things you want

05:02.750 --> 05:03.960
and people buy them for you.

05:03.960 --> 05:05.880
It just seems so greedy.

05:05.880 --> 05:07.670
I don't want people
knowing what I want.

05:07.670 --> 05:10.250
If you don't do this,
you're gonna end up
with six toasters,

05:10.250 --> 05:12.380

05:12.380 --> 05:13.500

Such as?

05:30.250 --> 05:31.120
I don't know!

Such as...

05:32.170 --> 05:33.380

05:33.380 --> 05:34.750
that sliced bread
is the great thing

05:34.750 --> 05:36.830
against which
all other great things
must be measured.

05:36.830 --> 05:38.670
Why do I even try?

05:38.670 --> 05:39.920
Do you still wanna go shopping?

05:39.920 --> 05:41.250
No!

05:41.250 --> 05:42.540
Of course not.

06:27.670 --> 06:29.920

06:29.920 --> 06:31.290
a guitar teacher?

06:31.290 --> 06:32.710
-Not really.
-Yes, he is.

06:32.710 --> 06:34.040
I'm not a guitar teacher.

06:34.040 --> 06:35.830
I'm just--
I'm his guitar teacher.

06:35.830 --> 06:37.710
But Bowie, you should
be a guitar teacher.

06:37.710 --> 06:39.120
He's amazing.

06:39.120 --> 06:41.710
By my second lesson,
he had me writing a song,

06:41.710 --> 06:44.580
and my third was performing
on this stage at open mic.

06:45.750 --> 06:47.290
Can you really do that?

06:47.290 --> 06:48.880
Well...

06:48.880 --> 06:50.670
I mean, I-- I did it.

06:50.670 --> 06:53.920

-And he's an

06:56.920 --> 06:58.920
It wasn't a world tour!

06:58.920 --> 07:00.830
It was a European tour.

07:00.830 --> 07:02.170
And parts of Asia.

07:02.170 --> 07:04.040
And, uh, Australia.

07:04.040 --> 07:05.380
It was only three continents.

07:05.380 --> 07:06.790

07:09.920 --> 07:11.170

07:12.830 --> 07:14.920
Hmm!

07:14.920 --> 07:15.750

Yes!

07:16.830 --> 07:17.880
Yeah!

07:17.880 --> 07:20.540

07:38.790 --> 07:40.960
Is this supposed
to make me feel good?
'Cause it's not.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.830
So, what are you gonna do?

07:42.830 --> 07:44.920

But don't you think
she could kind of tell

08:09.250 --> 08:10.830
that I didn't want him
to come?

08:10.830 --> 08:12.880
You've told her
you were fine with him.

08:12.880 --> 08:14.420
How is she supposed to know?

08:14.420 --> 08:16.120
Through my silence!

08:16.120 --> 08:17.920
Silence speaks volumes.

08:17.920 --> 08:19.790
You know what else
speaks volumes?

08:19.790 --> 08:21.210
Actually speaking.

08:21.210 --> 08:23.920
Ugh, I'm just not
gonna bring it up.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.380

So, about Walker...

-Look, tell me honestly--
-I need to be honest--

08:43.250 --> 08:45.460

08:47.880 --> 08:49.080
Okay, you were right.

08:50.120 --> 08:52.040
I do feel weird
around Walker.

08:52.040 --> 08:54.000
(chuckles)
I knew it!

08:54.000 --> 08:56.170
You don't really
want him to come

08:56.170 --> 08:58.380

08:58.380 --> 09:00.880
I'm sorry.

09:00.880 --> 09:02.170
I know it's stupid!

09:02.170 --> 09:04.170
It's not stupid.

09:04.170 --> 09:05.790
I'm glad you told me.

09:05.790 --> 09:06.880
Really?

09:06.880 --> 09:08.540
Really.

09:08.540 --> 09:09.620
I won't invite him.

09:09.620 --> 09:11.750
Thank you!

09:11.750 --> 09:13.540
But I also don't
want to be that friend

09:13.540 --> 09:14.920
that tells you what to do.

09:14.920 --> 09:15.960
I know!

09:15.960 --> 09:17.920
It's my decision!

09:19.500 --> 09:20.880
So, we're good?

09:20.880 --> 09:22.080
We're good.

09:22.080 --> 09:23.460
-(chuckles)
-Cyrus: Good!

09:23.460 --> 09:25.250
Look, I don't really
have a segue,

09:25.250 --> 09:27.250
but I did want
to show you guys
this chip that I found

09:27.250 --> 09:29.000
that looks just like Obama--

09:30.540 --> 09:31.880
(Cyrus groans)

09:33.920 --> 09:35.080
Never mind.

09:42.620 --> 09:43.880
(chuckling)

09:43.880 --> 09:45.380
Bex:
Oh, hi, Mom.

09:46.750 --> 09:47.880
I need to talk to you.

09:47.880 --> 09:49.040
Bex!

09:49.040 --> 09:50.420
This is a surprise!

09:50.420 --> 09:53.880
Oh, really?
So is this!

09:53.880 --> 09:56.920
Care to explain why
I just got a "Save The Date"

09:56.920 --> 09:58.540
to my own wedding?

09:58.540 --> 10:00.040
(tsks)
Oh, that!

10:00.040 --> 10:02.080
Lots of brides and grooms
send them out.

10:02.080 --> 10:04.620
Key word:
"brides and grooms."

10:04.620 --> 10:06.170
The bride and groom
send them out

10:06.170 --> 10:08.040
after the bride and groom
pick a date.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.920
That way, the bride

10:09.920 --> 10:12.080
feels less like smashing
the mother-of-the-bride's
living room knick-knacks.

10:12.080 --> 10:13.790
(sighs)
Look.

10:13.790 --> 10:14.880
I didn't choose the date!

10:14.880 --> 10:15.710
(scoffs)

10:15.710 --> 10:17.330
The I Ching did.

10:17.330 --> 10:18.580
I consulted it,

10:18.580 --> 10:20.960
and that was the most
auspicious day available.

10:20.960 --> 10:25.120
Mom, it's not just that
you picked a date without me.

10:25.120 --> 10:27.210
I have said over and over

10:27.210 --> 10:29.750
that I don't want
a formal, fussy wedding.

10:29.750 --> 10:31.750
And this-- this--

10:31.750 --> 10:33.210
This is proof that
you're still not listening.

10:34.540 --> 10:36.620
But you are getting married,

10:36.620 --> 10:40.080
and I refuse to let you
turn this important
milestone in your life

10:40.080 --> 10:43.040
into a casual after-thought.

10:43.040 --> 10:45.620
One where
everyone wears shorts
and brings children.

10:45.620 --> 10:47.380
Okay? You know what?

10:47.380 --> 10:50.080
If that's the case,
then I can RSVP
to this wedding right now,

10:50.080 --> 10:50.960
and it's gonna be a hard "no."

10:50.960 --> 10:54.000
Don't be ridiculous.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.960
You don't RSVP
to a "Save the Date."

10:58.120 --> 10:58.960
(whistle blows)

10:59.960 --> 11:01.170
Cyrus:
Hey, Mr. Bag?

11:01.170 --> 11:04.040
Hey there, Cyrus.
Great hustle out there today.

11:04.040 --> 11:05.460
Can we be real a second?

11:07.040 --> 11:11.040
I think we both know
I have very bad hustle.

11:11.040 --> 11:12.000
Well...

11:12.000 --> 11:13.380
And I think we both know

11:13.380 --> 11:16.120
I am never going to improve
on my 17-minute mile.

11:16.120 --> 11:18.620
Hey, as your P.E. teacher,

11:18.620 --> 11:19.790
I'm telling you.

11:19.790 --> 11:21.120
You could do anything
you set your mind to.

11:21.120 --> 11:22.170
I believe in you!

11:22.170 --> 11:25.080
And as a guy
who's being real...

11:25.080 --> 11:26.790
(chuckles)

11:26.790 --> 11:28.120
I'd say, "Sure.

11:28.120 --> 11:30.460
We may be looking at
peak performance from you."

11:30.460 --> 11:32.960
It's just that I'm failing,

11:32.960 --> 11:34.920
and I have a GPA
to think about.

11:34.920 --> 11:36.830
Is it really fair that
I don't get into college

11:36.830 --> 11:39.170
just because I can only do
the first half of a push-up?

11:39.170 --> 11:41.710
The first half of a push-up's
just laying down on the floor.

11:41.710 --> 11:43.210
Exactly!

11:43.210 --> 11:47.040
Well, taking a P.E. class
is not the only way
to get P.E. credit.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.500
There is another option.

11:48.500 --> 11:52.620
Whatever it is, I have
to be better at it than P.E.

11:52.620 --> 11:53.710
Right?

11:53.710 --> 11:55.500
(loud music playing)

11:55.500 --> 11:56.880
Dance teacher:
Strong arms!

11:56.880 --> 11:59.210
Five, six, seven, and one!

11:59.210 --> 12:01.120
Good! Use your energy!

12:02.120 --> 12:03.500
Find it! Open it!

12:03.500 --> 12:05.750
Good! Hit it!

12:05.750 --> 12:06.880
Big shoulder!

12:06.880 --> 12:08.290
Accentuate those shoulders.

12:09.330 --> 12:10.210
Big hip!

12:10.210 --> 12:12.920
Good!
One, two, three, four!

12:12.920 --> 12:14.120
Good!

12:14.120 --> 12:15.790
Good! Use those shoulders.

12:15.790 --> 12:19.120
One, three, a-five, six, seven!

12:19.120 --> 12:20.540
Energy! There it is!

12:20.540 --> 12:22.380
Okay, good!

12:22.380 --> 12:24.960
(continues, indistinct)

12:26.460 --> 12:27.710
Lengthen those arms!

12:27.710 --> 12:29.080
Strong legs, good!

12:30.040 --> 12:33.250
Use your energy!
Good strong arms!

12:33.250 --> 12:34.750
Here we go, Cyrus.

12:34.750 --> 12:36.290
Try to catch up.

12:36.290 --> 12:38.040
Good.

12:38.040 --> 12:39.040
You got it!

12:39.040 --> 12:40.830
Good, you guys!

12:40.830 --> 12:43.170
Find that ending!

12:43.170 --> 12:45.000
Roll into the floor!

12:45.000 --> 12:46.120
(continues, indistinct)

12:47.210 --> 12:49.040
Here we go! Big hit!

12:49.040 --> 12:50.330
-(music ends)
-Good!

12:50.330 --> 12:51.880
-Good, you guys.
-(clapping hands)

12:51.880 --> 12:52.920
Go take a break.

12:52.920 --> 12:55.790
(coughing)
I made a huge mistake.

12:55.790 --> 12:56.670
(huffs)

12:56.670 --> 12:59.120
(strumming same note)

13:01.290 --> 13:02.210
What are you doing?

13:02.210 --> 13:03.830
That's my favorite note.

13:03.830 --> 13:04.960
(strumming resumes)

13:06.290 --> 13:07.580
Do you know what note that is?

13:07.580 --> 13:09.750
Yeah, it's this one.

13:09.750 --> 13:11.670
-(strumming)
-(singing along to note, poorly)

13:14.620 --> 13:16.500
(discordant chord)

13:16.500 --> 13:17.500
Nice.

13:17.500 --> 13:19.500
Let's try a "C."

13:20.500 --> 13:22.120
(plays chord)

13:22.120 --> 13:23.380
(discordant chord)

13:26.170 --> 13:27.170
Did I do it?

13:27.170 --> 13:28.420
Not quite.

13:29.420 --> 13:31.290
(discordant chord)

13:31.290 --> 13:32.920
-See--
-Wait.

13:32.920 --> 13:34.330
-You're not--
-Wait.

13:34.330 --> 13:35.210
(discordant chord)

13:35.210 --> 13:36.710
-Look--
-Hold on.

13:37.830 --> 13:39.250
-Can I--
-Wait.

13:40.880 --> 13:42.120
(strumming, out of tune)

13:44.620 --> 13:46.170
Well, that's it for today.

13:46.170 --> 13:48.040
That wasn't as hard
as I thought it would be.

13:49.080 --> 13:50.250
Uh-huh.

13:50.250 --> 13:52.920
So, next lesson, I learn
how to write a song?

13:52.920 --> 13:55.290
Well, I think--

13:55.290 --> 13:57.210
'Cause I already know
how I want it to start.

13:57.210 --> 14:00.040
(strumming one note
repeatedly)

14:00.040 --> 14:02.460
(singing note)

14:08.290 --> 14:09.670
(continues singing,
strumming)

14:13.210 --> 14:14.880
I'm going!

14:14.880 --> 14:16.250
Bex:
Have fun!

14:18.920 --> 14:20.710
-Walker.
-Hey, Andi.

14:20.710 --> 14:22.380
What are you doing here?

14:22.380 --> 14:24.250
We need to talk.

14:31.040 --> 14:34.170
Can I just say these
surprise drop-ins of yours?

14:34.170 --> 14:35.620
Not really a fan.

14:35.620 --> 14:37.120
Guess I just believed you

14:37.120 --> 14:39.540
when you said
you hoped we could be friends.

14:41.210 --> 14:43.250
Buffy says you feel
weird around me?

14:43.250 --> 14:45.420
She told you that?

14:45.420 --> 14:47.080
She had to explain
why I couldn't come

14:47.080 --> 14:48.460
to the Color Factory
with her today.

14:48.460 --> 14:50.880
And now you're here
to make me feel bad about that.

14:50.880 --> 14:54.380
Andi, I'm here
because I don't want to
come between the two of you.

14:54.380 --> 14:56.330
Is there anything
we can do to fix this?

14:56.330 --> 14:57.710
I don't know.

14:58.710 --> 15:01.710
But it doesn't help knowing
you two are talking about me.

15:01.710 --> 15:03.580
You two are talking about me.

15:03.580 --> 15:07.000
And now here we are
talking about her.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.460
Somebody
please stop this ride.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.960
You should go
to The Color Factory.

15:13.960 --> 15:15.330
Are you sure?

15:15.330 --> 15:16.670
I'm sure.

15:17.790 --> 15:20.080
It's a Color Factory.

15:20.080 --> 15:22.620
You're a Color Factory.

15:22.620 --> 15:24.250
Of course you should go.

15:24.250 --> 15:25.790
We could go together.

15:25.790 --> 15:29.170
Did you not get enough
awkwardness just now?

15:29.170 --> 15:30.420
(chuckles)

15:30.420 --> 15:31.330
Good point.

15:33.040 --> 15:34.330
I guess I'll see you there.

15:43.620 --> 15:44.790
Thanks for being so cool.

15:44.790 --> 15:46.580
Anytime.

15:48.420 --> 15:49.960
Almost anytime.

15:49.960 --> 15:51.040
Sporadically.

15:51.040 --> 15:53.170
(both chuckle)

15:53.170 --> 15:54.500
-Okay.
-Okay!

15:56.500 --> 15:57.500
(sighs)

15:58.960 --> 16:01.380
♪ We got, we got we ♪

16:01.380 --> 16:04.040
♪ We got the best feeling ♪

16:04.040 --> 16:05.420
Why are you
walking like that?

16:05.420 --> 16:07.750
-Dance class.
-Is it hard?

16:07.750 --> 16:09.580
It's not so bad.

16:09.580 --> 16:11.460
It's torture!

16:11.460 --> 16:12.330
(both laugh)

16:12.330 --> 16:14.960
Then maybe you should
just go back to P.E.

16:14.960 --> 16:16.330
I can't.

16:16.330 --> 16:18.170
Not till next semester.

16:18.170 --> 16:20.830
I'm a dancer now.
There's no turning back.

16:20.830 --> 16:22.750
But there is turning around,

16:22.750 --> 16:24.500
and around and around!

16:24.500 --> 16:25.290
(chuckles)

16:25.290 --> 16:26.710
-Hey, guys!
-Hey.

16:26.710 --> 16:28.420
What are you doing here?

16:28.420 --> 16:30.040
Can I talk to you?

16:32.500 --> 16:34.500
I said you couldn't come.

16:34.500 --> 16:35.960
Well, I know.

16:35.960 --> 16:36.960
Andi said I could come!

16:36.960 --> 16:38.380
What?

16:38.380 --> 16:40.330
We talked, and we
worked everything out.

16:40.330 --> 16:42.040
When? Where?

16:42.040 --> 16:44.380
I think you're leaving out
a lot of important details.

16:44.380 --> 16:45.540
I'm gonna let her tell you.

16:46.790 --> 16:48.250
She'll be here any second.

16:50.120 --> 16:52.330
I'm telling you,
we worked it out.

16:52.330 --> 16:53.500
In the meantime...

16:53.500 --> 16:55.000
(chuckles)

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
look at this place!

16:56.000 --> 16:57.710
This is what
you call "in living color."

16:57.710 --> 16:58.880
(both laugh)

16:58.880 --> 17:00.080
Come on!

17:00.080 --> 17:01.580
Hey, can you snap a pic of us?

17:01.580 --> 17:02.670
Yeah!

17:06.790 --> 17:09.120
Okay, smile!

I think it's kinda nice
that your mom wants
to make a fuss over us.

17:47.620 --> 17:49.460
Oh, sure,
it's all fun and games

17:49.460 --> 17:50.880
until someone's in a gold tux

17:50.880 --> 17:52.750
getting butterflies
released behind him.

17:52.750 --> 17:54.960
A gold tux!

17:54.960 --> 17:57.500
We should plan the date
of our own wedding.

17:57.500 --> 17:59.170
Yeah, we should.

17:59.170 --> 18:00.880
What date do you
wanna get married?

18:02.380 --> 18:03.960
I dunno.

18:03.960 --> 18:05.380
What date do you
wanna get married?

18:05.380 --> 18:06.670
I dunno.

18:08.830 --> 18:10.710
(stammers)

18:10.710 --> 18:12.790
How about this one?

18:14.040 --> 18:15.420
-Hmm?
-(scoffs)

18:15.420 --> 18:16.670
I can't believe it!

18:16.670 --> 18:18.580
You are actually
taking her side?

18:18.580 --> 18:22.580
I'm just saying
that neither one of us
feels strongly about it,

18:22.580 --> 18:25.540
and Celia, obviously,
feels very strongly about it.

18:25.540 --> 18:27.290
So, why not
pick our battles?

18:27.290 --> 18:29.420
And just let her win?

18:29.420 --> 18:32.880
You and Celia worked very hard
to fix your relationship.

18:32.880 --> 18:35.710
It would be a shame
to throw it all away
on a postcard.

18:35.710 --> 18:36.920
Then nobody wins.

18:37.920 --> 18:39.790
And at the end of the day...

18:39.790 --> 18:41.250
I just wanna be
married to you.

18:41.250 --> 18:42.790
It doesn't matter which day.

18:44.500 --> 18:47.170
Must you always be
so reasonable all the time?

18:48.460 --> 18:50.420
-Yeah.
-(laughs softly)

18:51.460 --> 18:53.170
Still can't go in there?

18:53.170 --> 18:55.790
Mmm. Last contact
was about an hour ago.

18:55.790 --> 18:59.580
I offered her string cheese,
and she didn't crack the door.

18:59.580 --> 19:01.380
That's troubling.

19:03.000 --> 19:03.920
Hmm?

19:08.120 --> 19:10.250
-(knocking on door)
-Bowie: Andi?

19:10.250 --> 19:13.170
-What?
-Coming in!

19:13.170 --> 19:14.040
Yeah!

19:15.960 --> 19:17.500
Are you okay?

19:18.540 --> 19:20.830
Yeah, you seem a little...

19:20.830 --> 19:22.460
Well. (chuckles)

19:22.460 --> 19:24.120
Not in the mood
for clothing puns.

19:24.120 --> 19:25.460
Right.

19:26.750 --> 19:28.040
Not okay.

19:28.040 --> 19:29.380
What happened?

19:30.830 --> 19:32.170
Oh, that looks fun.

19:32.170 --> 19:34.830
(scoffs)
I know!

19:34.830 --> 19:37.670
They are having
a blast without me.

19:37.670 --> 19:39.880
-Why aren't you there?
-Because!

19:39.880 --> 19:43.830
I can't be with Buffy
when she's with Walker,

19:43.830 --> 19:46.120
and she'd rather be
with Walker than with me.

19:46.120 --> 19:48.460
I can't believe she'd say that!

19:48.460 --> 19:49.750
She didn't,

19:49.750 --> 19:51.920
but I know it's true.

19:51.920 --> 19:53.750
How do you know it's true?

19:56.040 --> 19:57.710
Exhibit A.

19:57.710 --> 20:01.460
Buffy told Walker that I didn't
want him to hang out with us.

20:01.460 --> 20:03.250
She's sharing
my secrets with him!

20:03.250 --> 20:05.500
Well, did you ask her
to keep it a secret?

20:05.500 --> 20:07.380
I shouldn't have to.

20:08.540 --> 20:09.920
And then there's this.

20:12.420 --> 20:14.670
"Something came up."
What came up?

20:14.670 --> 20:15.500
Exhibit B.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.620
-I--
-You lost us.

20:18.620 --> 20:20.710
She didn't ask what came up.

20:20.710 --> 20:23.080
She doesn't care
what came up!

20:23.080 --> 20:25.540
All I get is Exhibit C.

20:27.080 --> 20:29.670
Frowny-face me-moji.

20:29.670 --> 20:31.670
I think you may be
reading too much into this.

20:31.670 --> 20:33.460
Oh, really?

20:33.460 --> 20:34.540
Am I?

20:34.540 --> 20:37.710
Well then, I offer up
Exhibits D through N,

20:37.710 --> 20:38.880
sequential,

20:38.880 --> 20:40.460
and in full color.

20:40.460 --> 20:42.330
(scoffs)
Andiman.

20:42.330 --> 20:44.000
Buffy is your best friend.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.080
-Maybe you could
just talk to her.
-I did.

20:46.080 --> 20:49.500
I told her exactly how I felt.

20:51.330 --> 20:53.330
And she said
she totally understood.

20:53.330 --> 20:56.580
(scoffs)
And then the next thing I know,

20:56.580 --> 20:58.710
I'm getting punched
in the eyeballs.

20:58.710 --> 20:59.920
-Yikes!
-Stop.

20:59.920 --> 21:01.790
But that's what it feels like.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.620
Hey, I know.

21:05.790 --> 21:08.620
How about the three of us

21:08.620 --> 21:10.750
go to The Color Factory
tomorrow.

21:10.750 --> 21:12.250
-(gasps) Yeah!
-Pass.

21:12.250 --> 21:14.620
I'm not going
anywhere near there.

21:14.620 --> 21:17.500
It sounds like fun.
Come on!

21:17.500 --> 21:21.170
Buffy said it's one
of those places that you go

21:21.170 --> 21:23.880
just to take pictures
to post on social media

21:23.880 --> 21:25.830
and make other people
feel left out.

21:28.710 --> 21:31.080
Turns out she was right.

21:40.210 --> 21:42.380
Buffy:
Next on Andi Mack...

21:42.380 --> 21:43.620
-Nervous?
-Why would I be nervous?

21:43.620 --> 21:45.670
Because you're about to
start a girls basketball team.

21:45.670 --> 21:48.670
Only the entire history
of this school and your future

21:48.670 --> 21:50.790
will depend on it.

21:50.790 --> 21:52.540
Buffy:
This is a nightmare.

21:52.540 --> 21:53.710
They're terrible.

21:53.710 --> 21:56.120
Can you even believe
the no-break-up/break-up?

21:56.120 --> 21:57.710
It works!
I mean, look at us

21:57.710 --> 21:59.210
hanging out with no drama.

21:59.210 --> 22:01.620
I'm putting together an
open mic tomorrow night,

22:01.620 --> 22:02.830
and you are the
only one on the list,

22:02.830 --> 22:03.880
so you kinda have to do it.

22:03.880 --> 22:05.420
I only have one song.

22:05.420 --> 22:06.830
Bowie:
Then I guess you're gonna
have to write another one.

22:06.830 --> 22:08.580
This song's about me.
