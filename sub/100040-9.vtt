WEBVTT

00:09.926 --> 00:12.012
Not in this Janet. Next!

00:17.559 --> 00:18.893
What are you waiting for? Do it.

00:18.977 --> 00:20.478
It's not that easy.

00:20.562 --> 00:23.815
He lived a whole life,
and then 802 afterlives,

00:23.898 --> 00:26.151
then a second life,
then a second afterlife,

00:26.234 --> 00:27.986
then a third first afterlife...

00:28.069 --> 00:32.073
His psyche's like
a giant bowl of M&M Peep chili.

00:32.157 --> 00:35.076
I gotta make sure all the memories go
in the right place, in the right order.

00:35.160 --> 00:38.038
Maybe I just start him at the beginning.
A full factory reset.

00:38.121 --> 00:40.999
Man. Janet, can I please have a drink
with a lot of alcohol in it?

00:41.082 --> 00:43.918
Here, I saved this from my funeral.
It's called a Duval Ditchwater.

00:44.002 --> 00:46.129
It's Midori, Coffee-Mate and ditch water!

00:46.212 --> 00:47.964
-I'll get you a margarita.
-Yeah, that sounds better.

00:48.047 --> 00:49.632
It's not! Seriously, try this.

00:49.716 --> 00:51.593
-Okay, here we go.
- Whoa--

01:08.610 --> 01:09.736
Ooh.

01:09.819 --> 01:11.237
He has your eyes.

01:11.321 --> 01:12.906
And your smile.

01:12.989 --> 01:15.408
-Now, he just needs a name.
- Big decision.

01:15.492 --> 01:18.745
-How about Chidi?
- Oh, I like that.

01:18.828 --> 01:22.415
Do you like it, Chidi?
Or would you like a different name?

01:22.499 --> 01:24.542
- Oh.

01:24.626 --> 01:26.169
Looks like he has a tummyache.

01:26.252 --> 01:27.087
Oh.

01:27.170 --> 01:28.046
Chidi.

01:34.719 --> 01:37.430
You're not listening to me.
Everything always has to be your way.

01:37.514 --> 01:39.057
And what is
the one right way then?

01:39.140 --> 01:41.392
I mean, how many times
have I told you this?

01:41.476 --> 01:42.811
I thought
this is what you wanted.

01:42.894 --> 01:44.521
No!
It's obviously what you want.

01:44.604 --> 01:46.898
You're just angry
that your book was rejected.

01:46.981 --> 01:48.191
How dare
you bring that up again?

01:48.274 --> 01:50.109
You're always
at the university.

01:50.193 --> 01:54.197
How about you show some interest
in someone who didn't die 200 years ago?

01:54.280 --> 01:55.657
I don't know how much longer
I can keep this up.

01:55.740 --> 01:56.825
We need to go back to Nigeria.

01:56.908 --> 01:58.701
No, we are not going back.

01:58.785 --> 02:01.538
My family is here
and we did this for your career.

02:01.621 --> 02:03.039
- Oh.

02:04.916 --> 02:07.585
-Good morning, Chidi.
-Would you like some breakfast?

02:07.669 --> 02:09.087
I have a presentation.

02:09.170 --> 02:12.132
Here's the syllabus.
Take one and pass them on.

02:12.215 --> 02:15.301
My lecture will take
approximately 55 minutes.

02:15.385 --> 02:17.595
Let's begin, shall we?

02:18.221 --> 02:21.975
In conclusion, there is one clear answer,

02:22.058 --> 02:24.769
and it's that the two of you
should stay married.

02:24.853 --> 02:26.104
Questions?

02:26.187 --> 02:31.359
That was clear... and persuasive.

02:31.442 --> 02:33.444
And you have made a strong case.

02:33.528 --> 02:36.865
Yes, well-argued. Better than
some of my grad students.

02:36.948 --> 02:38.950
You should get ready for school.
I'll take you.

02:39.033 --> 02:40.702
We'll both take you.

02:43.079 --> 02:45.123
- It worked?
-Perfectly.

02:45.206 --> 02:46.499
They're happy again, Uzo.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.418
They're even talking
about getting me a puppy.

02:48.501 --> 02:51.671
But more importantly,
I proved once and for all

02:51.754 --> 02:53.923
that you can always find the answer.

02:54.007 --> 02:58.469
-The answer to what?
-To anything. Every problem has an answer.

02:58.553 --> 03:00.847
If you just read enough books
and think hard enough,

03:00.930 --> 03:03.182
you can figure out
the answer to any question.

03:03.266 --> 03:06.060
I know you're really smart,
but that sounds wrong.

03:06.144 --> 03:08.104
Children? Please take your seats.

03:08.187 --> 03:11.900
Here's a perfect example.
Where to sit? What's the answer?

03:11.983 --> 03:15.236
Obviously, we want to be back
by the pencil sharpener,

03:15.320 --> 03:17.739
but in the front,
I can see the blackboard better,

03:18.406 --> 03:21.200
or by the door to get a nice breeze?

03:21.284 --> 03:22.702
-Chidi?
- Just hang on.

03:22.785 --> 03:24.412
Sorry.

03:24.996 --> 03:26.497
Oh, no.

03:33.630 --> 03:36.883
I still say Professor Lindeman
was a fool to abandon Chidi.

03:36.966 --> 03:39.010
He has a brilliant mind.

03:39.093 --> 03:41.930
One day, he will use it to solve
the world's biggest problems.

03:42.013 --> 03:44.015
Is this enough cheese?
I hope this is enough cheese.

03:44.098 --> 03:45.934
There's sheep, goat and cow's milk.

03:46.017 --> 03:48.978
-I can run and get more.
-No, this is plenty of cheese.

03:50.063 --> 03:53.024
I have to ask,
has Chidi always been so thoughtful?

03:53.107 --> 03:54.817
Ever since he was a child.

03:54.901 --> 03:57.362
I'm sure you've heard about
his first great lecture?

03:57.445 --> 04:00.782
Oh, no, not that old story
again. It's so embarrassing.

04:00.865 --> 04:02.742
-Oh. Go ahead.

04:02.825 --> 04:06.663
A long time ago, Emeka and I were
going through a rough patch.

04:06.746 --> 04:11.459
And our little Chidi, at eight years old,
comes in with a one-hour lecture.

04:11.542 --> 04:13.795
All about why
we should stay married.

04:13.878 --> 04:17.590
And all these years later,
here we still are.

04:17.674 --> 04:19.759
-It's the reason I got into philosophy.
- Hmm.

04:19.842 --> 04:23.054
The biggest questions and the
biggest answers. You just gotta find them.

04:23.805 --> 04:25.640
I mean, I love philosophy, too.

04:25.723 --> 04:26.975
But I'd argue that, say,

04:27.058 --> 04:29.811
theoretical physics presents
bigger questions than philosophy.

04:33.773 --> 04:34.732
Do you really think that?

04:35.483 --> 04:36.609
Should I switch to physics?

04:37.902 --> 04:42.282
So, obviously, my parents loved you.

04:42.365 --> 04:44.450
I'm so glad. They're great.

04:45.076 --> 04:45.910
We have to break up.

04:46.828 --> 04:48.413
Uh...

04:48.496 --> 04:49.664
What? Why?

04:49.747 --> 04:51.666
I've been feeling this way
for a while now.

04:51.749 --> 04:54.335
It's just... why are we together?

04:54.419 --> 04:58.006
Because it makes sense.
I mean, you like Kant, I like Kant...

04:58.089 --> 05:02.176
-We're not a book group.
-Well, we're not... not a book group.

05:02.760 --> 05:05.972
Okay, if there's a problem
with our relationship,

05:06.055 --> 05:08.141
there is an answer that will solve it.

05:08.224 --> 05:09.559
So, let's hit the library.

05:09.642 --> 05:11.769
You wanna use philosophy?
How about David Hume?

05:11.853 --> 05:15.732
"Reason is and ought only to be
a slave to the passions."

05:15.815 --> 05:19.402
You know, emotions, desires, feelings.

05:19.485 --> 05:22.864
-Do you have any of those?
-Of course I have feelings.

05:22.947 --> 05:26.659
I have strong feelings for you
and what we have.

05:27.660 --> 05:31.205
And right now, I will show you...

05:34.959 --> 05:38.171
how Kant refuted
most of Hume's central theses.

05:38.254 --> 05:39.422
Oh, my God.

05:50.058 --> 05:54.437
- So, what do you think?
-I think it's 3,600 pages.

05:55.229 --> 05:57.023
I have a job, Chidi. I have a family.

05:57.106 --> 05:59.692
Until I had to read this,
I had a will to live.

05:59.776 --> 06:04.947
This work is an insane,
tangled web of inscrutability.

06:05.031 --> 06:09.327
In the fun, "grad students
will analyze this for centuries" way?

06:09.410 --> 06:10.828
No, in the Unabomber way.

06:11.412 --> 06:14.290
Okay. Well, um,
I'll write my way out of the maze.

06:14.373 --> 06:16.250
I'll re-outline the middle chapters,
do more research--

06:16.334 --> 06:17.168
No, Chidi!

06:17.919 --> 06:21.214
You can't answer every question
every philosopher has ever asked.

06:21.297 --> 06:24.675
So, what in these pages do you care about?

06:24.759 --> 06:27.553
-All of it. Equally.
-Shut up!

06:27.637 --> 06:30.932
-But-- Should I--
-Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

06:32.433 --> 06:35.853
The greatest works
of moral philosophy are emotional.

06:35.937 --> 06:40.566
They make an argument
about how the world is and ought to be.

06:40.650 --> 06:46.447
There is a great mind at work in here,
but where is the heart?

06:46.531 --> 06:47.865
Where are the guts?

06:48.950 --> 06:51.160
I understand. I do.

06:51.244 --> 06:56.207
So, I'm going to go home,
and compose a short paper for you,

06:56.290 --> 06:59.502
arguing that I should continue
working on this longer paper.

06:59.585 --> 07:00.837
Shut up!

07:04.799 --> 07:07.343
Wow. Tough week. Sorry, pal.

07:08.761 --> 07:12.598
Honestly, I don't know what hurts more,
my thesis meeting or Allesandra.

07:12.682 --> 07:15.893
She was brilliant, and funny...

07:15.977 --> 07:19.897
I thought that maybe she was the answer.

07:20.731 --> 07:23.151
Some things in life don't have an answer.

07:23.234 --> 07:25.361
Isn't that what Allesandra was saying?

07:25.445 --> 07:28.322
Isn't that
what your advisor said, too?

07:28.406 --> 07:30.241
Isn't that what everyone
who knows you has said to you

07:30.324 --> 07:31.784
at every waking moment of your life?

07:31.868 --> 07:33.077
Okay, I can figure this out.

07:33.161 --> 07:36.581
I just need to find the answer
for how to impress Allesandra,

07:36.664 --> 07:39.041
a separate answer
for how to impress my advisor

07:39.125 --> 07:42.420
or, ideally, one answer
for how to impress them both.

07:42.503 --> 07:44.505
-Oh, you know what this calls for?
-Don't say it.

07:44.589 --> 07:46.841
-A Venn diagram. Yeah.
-No Venn diagram.

07:46.924 --> 07:50.845
If you won't listen to other people,
do you at least hear what you're saying?

07:50.928 --> 07:53.389
I swear, sometimes it is literally...

07:53.473 --> 07:54.515
...impossible to be your friend.

07:54.599 --> 07:56.517
You're incapable
of making a single decision.

07:56.601 --> 08:00.021
Look, what's the harm in taking
a few extra minutes to find the perfect...

08:06.736 --> 08:08.529
Chidi? Come on in.

08:09.405 --> 08:11.449
Unless you'd be more comfortable out here?

08:11.532 --> 08:12.366
Oh.

08:12.867 --> 08:15.578
Well, I feel like you want me to...

08:15.661 --> 08:17.955
I'll tell you what, I'll decide for you.
Come on in.

08:18.039 --> 08:18.956
Great.

08:25.963 --> 08:26.797
<i>Watch this.</i>

08:27.965 --> 08:29.842
Your fridge chooses
your breakfast for you.

08:29.926 --> 08:32.261
Oatmeal and almond milk.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.930
Extra filmy.
You don't even have to decide.

08:34.013 --> 08:35.556
It just knows what you want.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.725
And for all your other requests...

08:38.684 --> 08:39.519
Janet?

08:39.602 --> 08:40.436
-Hi, there.

08:41.604 --> 08:45.525
Janet knows the answers
to all the questions in the universe.

08:45.608 --> 08:46.609
Ask her anything.

08:48.444 --> 08:49.362
Which answer do I want?

08:50.071 --> 08:53.824
Something profound, obviously.
Shouldn't be trivial or salacious.

08:53.908 --> 08:57.245
Or maybe I should start small,
maybe ramp up.

08:57.328 --> 08:59.413
I... or... I can't...

09:00.748 --> 09:02.625
-What's the biggest fish?
-The whale shark.

09:03.459 --> 09:04.544
Cool.

09:04.627 --> 09:06.921
I'm sorry.
I'll have better questions later.

09:07.004 --> 09:11.217
You don't need to apologize, Chidi.
All questions are equally important to me.

09:11.300 --> 09:13.094
Oh, well, then,
you and I are gonna get along great.

09:15.263 --> 09:17.473
I need to go welcome some more residents.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.851
Are there any other questions
I can answer for you before I go?

09:20.935 --> 09:25.690
Well, yes. Is there a relationship
equivalent to the oatmeal?

09:25.773 --> 09:26.607
Uh...

09:26.691 --> 09:29.235
-Is there a, sort of...
-Soulmate?

09:30.361 --> 09:31.195
Yes.

09:31.279 --> 09:35.700
Every person in the Good Place
has one perfect match.

09:35.783 --> 09:39.161
In an hour, come on by the little house
that looks like a face,

09:39.245 --> 09:42.290
and get the answer
to your ultimate question.

09:42.915 --> 09:44.208
Her name's Eleanor.

09:53.634 --> 09:56.637
Oh, man. Remember this?

09:56.721 --> 09:59.056
Yeah! Yeah, that was eight minutes ago.

09:59.140 --> 10:00.057
Mmm-hmm.

10:00.141 --> 10:02.226
So, you just proposed to Janet,

10:02.310 --> 10:04.812
-and you said yes, and now you're married.
- Mmm-hmm.

10:04.895 --> 10:05.730
Mmm-hmm.

10:05.813 --> 10:09.734
You know, I thought saying that out loud
would make it less insane, but it did not.

10:09.817 --> 10:10.901
Thanks, homie.

10:10.985 --> 10:14.447
If you'd like to get us a present,
we're registered at me.

10:15.448 --> 10:18.159
Jason, I think I need your help.
Can I ask you something?

10:18.242 --> 10:20.411
Whoa. No one's ever
asked me for advice before.

10:20.494 --> 10:21.787
And you're a high school principal.

10:21.871 --> 10:23.122
College professor.

10:23.205 --> 10:25.207
Who told you how to do this?

10:25.291 --> 10:28.294
How can you
just make a decision this big?

10:28.919 --> 10:31.797
Chidi, here's the thing with stuff.

10:31.881 --> 10:35.343
You can look at a problem from
every angle and drive yourself crazy,

10:35.426 --> 10:38.804
but sometimes you just gotta huck
a Molotov cocktail at a drone

10:38.888 --> 10:40.598
and see what happens.

10:40.681 --> 10:42.391
Is what happens that the drone blows up?

10:42.475 --> 10:43.392
Usually.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.895
I mean, where I'm from,
most things blow up eventually.

10:45.978 --> 10:49.815
So I learned that when something
dope comes along, you gotta lock it down.

10:49.899 --> 10:51.484
If you're always frozen in fear,

10:51.567 --> 10:53.819
and taking too long
to think about what to do,

10:53.903 --> 10:55.071
you'll miss your opportunity,

10:55.154 --> 10:57.573
and maybe get sucked
into the propeller of a swamp boat.

10:58.157 --> 11:02.453
I just don't think I'll ever be
the kind of person who just... acts.

11:02.536 --> 11:06.499
I mean, I can't just open a door
and walk through

11:06.582 --> 11:08.584
without knowing what's on the other side.

11:09.377 --> 11:13.214
Even with eternity to try,
I just don't think that can happen.

11:13.297 --> 11:15.758
Well, I never thought
I'd ever be able to get married.

11:15.841 --> 11:17.051
I thought I was too old.

11:17.635 --> 11:22.264
I'm infinity, but strange things
happen in the afterlife.

11:26.936 --> 11:29.146
We figured it out once.
We can do it again.

11:29.230 --> 11:30.940
Because you know what, Michael?

11:31.023 --> 11:32.191
-Ya basic--

11:32.983 --> 11:35.319
<i>This is</i>
<i>your soulmate, Salamasina.</i>

11:35.403 --> 11:37.154
<i>Meet your soulmate, Guan-yin.</i>

11:37.238 --> 11:38.614
<i>Tahani. Karen.</i>

11:38.697 --> 11:42.076
Esmerelda, you don't bring knives
to a friendly game night.

11:42.159 --> 11:42.993
I mean, who does that?

11:43.577 --> 11:44.453
The prepared.

11:45.121 --> 11:47.915
Chidi, Esmerelda, it's your turn!

11:51.377 --> 11:53.462
Blood. Seas of blood.

11:53.546 --> 11:54.839
Enemies.

11:54.922 --> 11:55.881
Uh...

11:55.965 --> 11:57.133
A thousand years of darkness.

11:57.216 --> 12:00.344
-Uh... Nightmares.
-Blood. Ennui?

12:01.137 --> 12:04.682
Lamenting the inexorable passage of time.
Fire and blood.

12:04.765 --> 12:07.518
-Ugh! You fool.

12:07.601 --> 12:08.727
It was "birthday parties."

12:08.811 --> 12:10.312
"Birthday parties"?

12:10.396 --> 12:14.108
These trivialities demean me.
I must away and tend to my ravens.

12:16.360 --> 12:19.447
Well, you never know
what'll happen at game night.

12:19.530 --> 12:21.073
Let's continue.

12:21.866 --> 12:23.951
I think I can find you
another partner.

12:27.079 --> 12:29.832
Tahani, thank you so much.

12:29.915 --> 12:33.085
That ended up being one of the best nights
I've had since we got here.

12:33.169 --> 12:34.336
You and Eleanor made a good pair.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.714
You two really tore through
that round of charades.

12:36.797 --> 12:40.342
Oh, I'm pretty sure she was reading the
cards off the reflection in my glasses,

12:40.426 --> 12:42.720
but, yeah, that was amazing.

12:43.888 --> 12:44.722
Um...

12:46.182 --> 12:48.058
-Can I ask you something?
-Hmm.

12:48.142 --> 12:49.351
Tonight could've been a real disaster.

12:49.435 --> 12:52.396
How do you have
the confidence to just swoop in

12:52.480 --> 12:56.817
and so elegantly take charge
of a whole group of strangers?

12:56.901 --> 13:00.446
Honestly, the confidence
comes from failure.

13:00.529 --> 13:04.325
I've thrown my fair share
of disastrous gatherings.

13:04.408 --> 13:07.411
Remind me to tell you someday
about Timothée Chalamet's bar mitzvah.

13:07.995 --> 13:11.290
But you live through the failure
and you learn from it.

13:12.082 --> 13:13.959
Yeah, I just can't operate that way.

13:14.043 --> 13:17.588
I can't make a decision
unless I'm sure I'm right.

13:17.671 --> 13:20.424
Hey, Chidi.
You're a philosophy professor, right?

13:20.508 --> 13:23.761
Any chance you'd want to grab a drink
and talk about ethics?

13:23.844 --> 13:27.598
It's a subject I've recently
needed to learn about, immediately.

13:27.681 --> 13:30.351
-Sounds great. Uh, let me get my coat.
- Awesome.

13:30.434 --> 13:34.605
By the way, I wasn't cheating before...
or eavesdropping just now.

13:36.649 --> 13:37.525
<i>Whoo!</i>

13:37.608 --> 13:39.276
When we started three months ago,

13:39.360 --> 13:43.197
I never thought I'd get so into philosophy
that we'd study past midnight.

13:44.198 --> 13:46.992
Esmerelda must be wondering
where her soulmate is.

13:47.076 --> 13:48.911
-Ah. She's off in her aviary.
-Oh.

13:48.994 --> 13:51.038
Sometimes, I think her ravens
are her real soulmate.

13:52.206 --> 13:53.749
I'm not kidding, actually.

13:53.832 --> 13:55.459
You should see her with them.
It's intense.

13:55.543 --> 13:57.586
And if I'm being honest, sexually charged.

13:58.170 --> 14:01.799
Anyways. Um...
This has been fun as always--

14:04.218 --> 14:05.219
Uh...

14:06.053 --> 14:08.722
What was... Why did you...

14:09.348 --> 14:10.182
Who was it?

14:11.433 --> 14:14.853
Okay, I'll take those one at a time,
I guess. Um...

14:15.813 --> 14:16.772
It was a kiss.

14:17.940 --> 14:20.109
I did it because I wanted to.

14:20.192 --> 14:23.445
And as far as who it was,
it was me, weirdo.

14:24.029 --> 14:26.240
Eleanor, I have a soulmate.

14:26.323 --> 14:29.118
Yeah, and you're not into her at all.

14:29.201 --> 14:33.622
I mean, come on. There is no way
you're supposed to spend eternity

14:33.706 --> 14:35.749
with a woman who sleeps in a giant nest.

14:35.833 --> 14:39.295
I know she and I are in a rough patch,

14:39.378 --> 14:42.047
but we just have to find the answer
for how to get out of it.

14:42.131 --> 14:43.090
Like my parents.

14:43.173 --> 14:44.675
You remember that story
I told you about my parents?

14:44.758 --> 14:47.928
Yeah, I don't think that story is
as cute as you think it is, man.

14:48.637 --> 14:55.019
I mean, I'm sure you were cute, you know,
big melon head and a little necktie.

14:55.102 --> 14:59.231
But that moment? Woof, that's too much
to put on an eight-year-old.

14:59.982 --> 15:03.068
I kinda wish
cute little Chidi just got to be a kid,

15:03.569 --> 15:06.947
rather than a miniature professor
trying to solve all the world's problems.

15:07.031 --> 15:11.702
Well, but...
living that way led me to philosophy.

15:11.785 --> 15:14.914
And, sure, I was written up
in a medical journal

15:14.997 --> 15:17.416
as the youngest person ever
with a stress-induced ulcer,

15:17.499 --> 15:19.251
but I got into the Good Place.

15:19.335 --> 15:20.794
So, if you don't mind,

15:20.878 --> 15:26.133
I'm gonna take a second to think about
what I owe my universe-approved soulmate,

15:26.216 --> 15:30.262
and not just, uh, make out with you.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.599
Okay, man. Kiss rescinded.

15:33.682 --> 15:39.063
We'll just study, like two platonic nerds,
until Michael discovers me,

15:39.146 --> 15:42.816
or until Esmerelda turns me into a toad
with her magic amulet,

15:42.900 --> 15:46.654
because she can see
that we're obviously into each other.

15:47.404 --> 15:51.742
Oh. Sorry you got an actual human being
instead of your true soulmate...

15:51.825 --> 15:54.495
-a library cart full of damp saltines.

15:54.578 --> 15:55.913
You are unbelievable.

15:55.996 --> 15:58.165
I don't know what I did...

15:58.248 --> 15:59.833
-...to deserve you.

15:59.917 --> 16:02.878
Believe it, baby. I'm all yours.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.130
At least until
something better comes along.

16:05.756 --> 16:08.634
For me. You've pretty much topped out.

16:09.343 --> 16:10.594
- You okay?
-No!

16:10.678 --> 16:13.847
I have to give Michael a new draft
of my thesis and I'm a mess.

16:13.931 --> 16:14.890
Will you help me?

16:14.974 --> 16:19.144
Woof! You want my help with philosophy?
You must be in rough shape.

16:19.228 --> 16:21.021
-I mean, yes, of course.

16:21.105 --> 16:23.148
I'm here for you. What do you need?

16:23.232 --> 16:27.695
I need someone to help guide me,
morally speaking.

16:27.778 --> 16:31.115
And I think I need it to be you.

16:32.116 --> 16:34.994
There's a real possibility
that I'm in love with you again,

16:35.661 --> 16:39.915
here, on this plane of existence,
uh, today, now.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.337
<i>We found each other before,</i>
<i>hundreds of times.</i>

16:45.963 --> 16:47.172
We can do it again.

16:52.928 --> 16:54.346
Bye, Chidi.

16:57.558 --> 16:58.892
<i>You sure you want to do this?</i>

16:58.976 --> 17:01.228
I finally make up my mind
about one damn thing

17:01.311 --> 17:02.396
and you try to talk me out of it?

17:04.648 --> 17:05.649
I'm sure.

17:07.484 --> 17:08.652
Can I ask you a question?

17:10.112 --> 17:14.199
Soulmates aren't real, are they?

17:14.950 --> 17:18.203
Chidi, in all honesty, I don't know.
But I don't think so.

17:19.329 --> 17:23.459
I knew what you expected to find
when you got here: answers.

17:24.668 --> 17:28.047
Also, if I recall from your file,
a magic blackboard?

17:28.130 --> 17:30.966
One that anticipates your lesson flow.
That is the dream.

17:32.092 --> 17:33.761
But mostly you wanted answers.

17:35.137 --> 17:37.514
The "soulmate" one in particular.

17:37.598 --> 17:41.143
So, I used it to torture you.

17:41.226 --> 17:43.645
Which, again, sorry.

17:44.897 --> 17:50.277
If soulmates do exist,
they're not found, they're made.

17:50.360 --> 17:53.197
People meet, they get a good feeling

17:53.280 --> 17:55.991
and then they get to work,
building a relationship.

17:56.658 --> 17:57.743
Like your parents.

17:58.786 --> 18:03.082
They didn't magically stay together
because you proved they should.

18:05.459 --> 18:08.629
It wasn't my logic or my presentation.

18:08.712 --> 18:12.758
It was the feeling they got watching me,

18:12.841 --> 18:17.846
this scared little kid,
telling them that he needed them.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.807
And it was also
what you made them remember.

18:19.890 --> 18:21.225
They loved each other.

18:21.308 --> 18:23.268
Sometimes, people forget.

18:23.352 --> 18:25.854
You reminded them
of what they already had.

18:25.938 --> 18:28.232
It convinced them to go to counseling.

18:28.816 --> 18:29.942
I never knew they went to counseling.

18:30.025 --> 18:31.485
Yeah, kids are idiots.

18:31.568 --> 18:34.988
If they knew half the stuff their folks
were up to, they'd lose their minds.

18:36.698 --> 18:43.372
Turns out, life isn't a puzzle that can
just be solved one time and it's done.

18:44.081 --> 18:48.418
You wake up every day
and you solve it again.

18:49.211 --> 18:50.629
Terribly inefficient.

18:54.174 --> 18:56.093
Ah, what a time to learn.

19:00.055 --> 19:01.098
Can you give me a second?

19:12.734 --> 19:14.403
-Janet?
-Hi, there.

19:14.486 --> 19:15.362
Hi.

19:16.488 --> 19:18.782
Uh, can I have a pen and some paper?

19:25.038 --> 19:30.460
I don't know if I'll see you again,
or what I'll remember if I do,

19:30.544 --> 19:36.049
but if we do cross paths again,
sometime, somewhere...

19:38.552 --> 19:39.803
can you get this back to me?

19:40.387 --> 19:41.221
Of course.

19:51.231 --> 19:52.149
I'm ready.

20:01.825 --> 20:02.993
Hi, there, Chidi.

20:05.245 --> 20:06.330
Welcome back.

20:06.914 --> 20:09.208
Is he all right? Did you break him?

20:09.791 --> 20:12.294
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

20:13.629 --> 20:15.714
Man, I'm doin' great.

20:16.465 --> 20:22.137
Hey, so, for the past 300 years,
have I been super annoying?

20:22.846 --> 20:23.680
Oh, no...

20:23.764 --> 20:25.891
- No, I wouldn't say... No, no.
- Well, not extremely...

20:25.974 --> 20:27.434
- Yes.
- Well, thank you,

20:27.517 --> 20:30.229
all of you,
for everything you've done for me.

20:30.312 --> 20:32.022
You are wonderful people.

20:32.105 --> 20:36.109
Yeah, man, that's great, but, um, listen,
we have one hour to create

20:36.193 --> 20:39.780
an entirely new afterlife
and, uh, also save all of humanity,

20:39.863 --> 20:45.160
and we were wondering if you could do
your Chidi thing and find us the answer?

20:45.869 --> 20:49.414
Oh, well, Eleanor, this kind of thing
doesn't have just one answer.

20:49.498 --> 20:51.541
There might be 800.

20:51.625 --> 20:53.752
There could be zero. Who knows?

20:53.835 --> 20:56.421
The journey is the destination, right?

20:56.505 --> 20:58.173
Let's get to work.
Can you give me one second?

20:59.424 --> 21:02.261
Hey, uh, Janet?
Can I have my note, please?

21:03.345 --> 21:06.640
If you know that you wrote a note
then you know what it says.

21:06.723 --> 21:11.687
I do, uh, but I'd still
like to see it again, please.

21:11.770 --> 21:14.106
I think it might be
some of the best writing I've ever done.
