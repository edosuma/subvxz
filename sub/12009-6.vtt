WEBVTT

00:04.534 --> 00:07.534
Doughnuts! And the sun
shall beat down,

00:07.574 --> 00:11.254
and burn all those people
living in the hills.

00:11.294 --> 00:16.294
Doughnuts! And those people
living on the lands
that are neither high nor low

00:16.334 --> 00:21.254
will also die through a combination
of burning and drowning.

00:21.294 --> 00:24.774
None of you are safe.
The end is nigh.

00:24.814 --> 00:26.734
Come get your doughnuts!

00:26.774 --> 00:29.254
So... When's the world ending?

00:29.294 --> 00:31.574
Oh, I dunno. I were listening
to that doughnut guy.

00:31.614 --> 00:34.054
Nigh, apparently. Oh, right. Nigh.

00:34.094 --> 00:37.854
Hang on, doesn't that mean soon?
Well, yeah. To the people
that say it, it means soon.

00:37.894 --> 00:40.374
To everyone else, it means
you're a nutter talking shit.

00:40.414 --> 00:42.534
I'm gonna get a doughnut,
just in case.

00:43.774 --> 00:45.934
If the world did end,
I'd be bloody miffed.

00:45.974 --> 00:47.734
I've got so much to give.

00:47.774 --> 00:50.174
I dunno.
I can see the appeal of oblivion.

00:50.214 --> 00:51.814
At least everyone would shut up.

00:51.854 --> 00:54.854
We're just broke single dickheads,
anyway. What have we got to live for?

00:54.894 --> 00:58.374
Mate, you dunno what you're
talking about. The future
is gonna be peachy as shit.

00:58.414 --> 01:00.814
Yeah? You think? Yeah, I do think.

01:00.854 --> 01:03.254
We'll get a new flat,
climb the corporate ladder.

01:03.294 --> 01:05.854
You'll get with Cynthia,
I'll get with everybody else.

01:05.894 --> 01:07.934
And when's this happening, exactly?

01:07.974 --> 01:10.174
Well, I don't know when exactly,
but it is nigh.

01:10.214 --> 01:11.854
It's really fucking nigh.

01:12.574 --> 01:28.827
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

01:31.094 --> 01:34.774
How's the doughnut, then?
Oh, nasty. Don't like it.

01:34.814 --> 01:36.814
But you gonna finish it?
Oh, yeah.

01:39.614 --> 01:42.254
Hey, guys! Isn't this wicked?

01:42.294 --> 01:45.094
Look at all the Saturnalia stuff
we've bought. Oh, brilliant.

01:45.134 --> 01:47.974
What have you got? So far,
we've got a set of wooden eggs

01:48.014 --> 01:49.854
and some tiny straw animals.

01:49.894 --> 01:52.534
Just the essentials.
Mets, look! Wind chimes!

01:52.574 --> 01:55.454
We do need some wind chimes.
But, of course.

01:57.134 --> 01:59.614
Shit! I'm so sorry.
Are you all right?

01:59.654 --> 02:02.134
You bloody fool! I'm really sorry.

02:02.174 --> 02:06.774
It was an accident.
Before the year's out,
you'll have an accident of your own.

02:06.814 --> 02:08.973
What? Really?
All right. She said she was sorry.

02:09.014 --> 02:11.014
Do you want some? No, thank you.

02:13.374 --> 02:16.174
Wow, that was creepy.
Nah, it's probably fine.

02:16.214 --> 02:20.334
Earlier, she was banging on
about the end of the world.
She's just a real wet blanket.

02:20.374 --> 02:22.014
Right, yeah.

02:22.054 --> 02:24.054
Mad old trout.

02:26.894 --> 02:29.014
Midnight, tomorrow, my friend.

02:29.054 --> 02:32.574
That's when it's nigh.
That's when people lose their shit.

02:32.614 --> 02:36.054
OK. In a good way? Yeah.
You'll finally get with Cynthia.

02:36.094 --> 02:39.734
Apparently, everyone rams
into the Forum for the countdown
and the gong banging.

02:39.774 --> 02:43.094
Then, all the girls
gruffle whoever they're next to.

02:43.134 --> 02:44.734
Why would they do that? I dunno.

02:44.774 --> 02:48.054
Carnival atmosphere? Moment
of madness cos it's cold? Who cares?

02:48.094 --> 02:51.134
It's no longer about who you are,
it's about where you stand.

02:51.174 --> 02:56.654
Let me get this straight. A hideous
dog-man could snog a really hot
babe just by standing next to her?

02:56.694 --> 02:59.614
Well, come along and we'll
test it out. Oh, very funny. Not.

02:59.654 --> 03:03.774
I'm busy.
At Saturnalia, I always volunteer
at a homeless shelter. Wow. Wowzer.

03:03.814 --> 03:08.254
I did not know that.
What do you do? I give them food,
a bath, a warm bed for the night.

03:08.294 --> 03:10.094
Why is it warm?
Are you in the bed? Ha, no.

03:10.134 --> 03:12.294
Do you cuddle them in the bed?
Of course I don't.

03:12.334 --> 03:14.134
So, you fuck them warm?
What? Oh, my God.

03:14.174 --> 03:17.134
I don't get it.
If you don't cuddle them -
I do not fuck the homeless warm!

03:17.174 --> 03:20.174
Well, good.
You'd think they'd suffered enough.

03:20.214 --> 03:22.774
Can I have this in a larger
font? It's giving me a headache.

03:22.814 --> 03:25.374
To clarify, I work at a homeless
shelter at Saturnalia.

03:25.414 --> 03:27.574
It's not a sex arrangement.
How noble of you.

03:27.614 --> 03:30.014
I'd love to do something like that
but I worry I'd hate it.

03:30.054 --> 03:32.814
And, alas, I can't.
It's my annual Saturnalia bash.

03:32.854 --> 03:35.174
I have gone a bit
overboard this year.

03:35.214 --> 03:39.574
Really? Who's going?
Friends, colleagues, waifs and
strays, people I actively despise.

03:39.614 --> 03:41.614
Pretty much everyone I've ever met.

03:44.134 --> 03:46.774
I mean, how do we not fit
into one of those groups?

03:53.974 --> 03:56.814
Salve, Grumio.
Compliments of the season to you.

03:56.854 --> 04:01.134
Cheers. By the way, Marcus said
I had to have a go at you about
the damp in one of the rooms.

04:01.174 --> 04:03.294
Oh, right. Well, go on then.
OK, cool.

04:03.334 --> 04:06.174
There's damp in one of the rooms.
Yeah, it's a wet room.

04:06.214 --> 04:08.454
Oh...wicked.

04:08.494 --> 04:10.574
I'll pass that on. If you would.

04:10.614 --> 04:12.734
Can you smell that, by the way?

04:12.774 --> 04:14.814
What is it?
It's like someone's having a BBQ.

04:14.854 --> 04:16.494
Oh, that. Yeah, that's the temple.

04:16.534 --> 04:19.414
They get all sacrificey
during Saturnalia.

04:19.454 --> 04:21.214
So, who eats all the meat, then?

04:21.254 --> 04:23.454
The gods.
Yeah, but who really eats it?

04:23.494 --> 04:28.174
Oh, I guess... Dogs, ants
and any other animals
that aren't that religious.

04:28.214 --> 04:30.214
Bit of a waste, if you ask me.

04:32.000 --> 04:38.074

04:42.374 --> 04:44.094
Season's greetings, Metella.

04:44.134 --> 04:45.814
Just say hi. Yeah, hi.

04:45.854 --> 04:50.494
Tomorrow night we're going to
the Forum for the gong banging,
and you guys should definitely come.

04:50.534 --> 04:53.254
I'm having a quiet one. Thanks.
Brilliant. Just Cynthia, then.

04:53.294 --> 04:55.134
Yep, she's the reason it's quiet.

04:55.174 --> 04:58.134
After that crone cursed her,

04:58.174 --> 05:00.574
she's been terrified
about having an accident. What?

05:00.614 --> 05:03.254
That's... Cynthia!
I really wouldn't bother.

05:03.294 --> 05:06.654
What? Who is it? It's Marcus.
Has he got anything jagged on him?

05:06.694 --> 05:08.694
Just his face.

05:12.054 --> 05:14.374
Wow. You look cosy.
What is it, Marcus? Quickly.

05:14.414 --> 05:16.694
OK, listen.
Forget the whole curse thing.

05:16.734 --> 05:18.814
Come to the Forum.
Saturnalia tomorrow night.

05:18.854 --> 05:21.574
It's gonna be this massive, wild,
incredibly safe party.

05:21.614 --> 05:23.854
The Forum? Are you mad?
No. I'll protect you!

05:23.894 --> 05:26.694
I could get trampled on.
So... You can go on my shoulders.

05:26.734 --> 05:30.774
Or, I could get struck by lightning.
So... I'll go on your shoulders.

05:30.814 --> 05:32.614
I'm not sure I can manage that.

05:32.654 --> 05:34.654
Maybe next year.

05:36.814 --> 05:38.534
Put a word in...

05:42.534 --> 05:45.414
Find the crone
and make her reverse the curse.

05:45.454 --> 05:47.814
Do a reverse-a-curse.
The crone hates us.

05:47.854 --> 05:49.774
She nearly cursed me.
Well, then, pay her off.

05:49.814 --> 05:52.294
Or, even better,
get her to say something good, like,

05:52.334 --> 05:54.774
'This year, you will shag Marcus.'

05:54.814 --> 05:57.334
That's an even worse curse.
A worse-a-curse.

05:59.054 --> 06:00.974
What is this meat, Grum?
It's so tasty.

06:01.014 --> 06:03.414
Yeah? I dunno. OK.

06:03.454 --> 06:06.694
Hang on, not OK. Why don't you know?
It's not from a shop.

06:06.734 --> 06:09.694
OK. Where's it from? Temple.
Right. Getting there.

06:09.734 --> 06:12.254
Why's it from the temple?
They sacrifice meat.

06:12.294 --> 06:14.534
And you bought it, or...? Nabbed it.

06:14.574 --> 06:17.574
I see. So, we're eating
stolen sacrificial meat, now?

06:19.894 --> 06:23.294
Right, you're fine with that?
That we're chowing down
on the food of the gods?

06:23.334 --> 06:27.814
I know. It's delicious.
No, but it's really bad form
to steal the gods' food.

06:27.854 --> 06:31.454
The gods aren't hungry.
Or, you know... Real.

06:31.494 --> 06:35.374
Either way, it's not getting eaten.
He's doing them a favour,
tidying up all their loose meat.

06:35.414 --> 06:38.174
We shouldn't be eating loose meat.
We dunno what it is.

06:38.214 --> 06:41.454
Well, it tastes like chicken.
Yeah, you know what else
tastes like chicken?

06:41.494 --> 06:43.374
Humans.

06:43.414 --> 06:45.414
Do they even do
human sacrifices any more?

06:45.454 --> 06:48.574
Grumio, what are the chances
that this is a person?

06:48.614 --> 06:51.814
Very slim.
This is a chicken leg, Marcus.

06:51.854 --> 06:54.694
Look, there is no way
that's from a human.

06:54.734 --> 06:56.774
This person would be laughably tiny.

06:58.814 --> 07:00.574
Or a baby.

07:00.614 --> 07:04.134
I'm joking. I'm mucking about.
It won't be a baby. I'm finished.

07:05.334 --> 07:07.054
Oooh.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.094
Yes, thank you very much.

07:09.974 --> 07:12.654
Because I need her
to come to the Forum with us.

07:12.694 --> 07:15.894
So, if you could tell her that she
definitely won't have an accident.

07:15.934 --> 07:17.614
But she will have an accident.

07:17.654 --> 07:20.974
If she doesn't leave the flat,
how's she gonna gruffle him?
Kiss him. Kiss me.

07:21.014 --> 07:23.574
She will not kiss you.
No, because of you.

07:23.614 --> 07:26.134
Because it is written.
Is it written, though?

07:26.174 --> 07:30.494
Cos I've got some money here
that should more than cover
the whole rewriting process.

07:30.534 --> 07:33.374
It can not be rewritten.
It is too late.

07:33.414 --> 07:35.374
The seas are rising.

07:35.414 --> 07:37.054
No, you've already done that one.

07:37.094 --> 07:39.574
The people in the
lowlands will drown.

07:39.614 --> 07:41.414
No, they won't. Shut up.

07:41.454 --> 07:45.014
What are lowlands, anyway?
Who says lowlands, you daft old bint.

07:45.054 --> 07:48.974
Hey, whoa! What you doing?
You will be forever miserable.

07:49.014 --> 07:52.254
And your penis will be shrivelled.

07:52.294 --> 07:55.414
Not bothered. Tell me something new.
He's ten steps ahead of you, love.

07:55.454 --> 07:57.214
Picked the wrong penis to shrivel.

07:57.254 --> 08:00.134
This guy invented the shrivelled
penis! All right. That's a bit much.

08:00.174 --> 08:02.174
Just backing you up.

08:18.014 --> 08:20.334
So, you know these sacrifices?

08:20.374 --> 08:22.214
Yes, yes. What about them?

08:22.254 --> 08:24.134
Do they come in lamb?

08:24.174 --> 08:25.934
I'm sorry,
do they what, little buddy?

08:25.974 --> 08:28.094
Do you do 'em in lamb?

08:28.134 --> 08:31.614
Yes, we can sacrifice lambs.
Why do you ask?

08:31.654 --> 08:36.094
Just... I reckon the gods would be
well into that chubby one, there.

08:36.134 --> 08:38.933
Right. Well, it's good of you
to take an interest.

08:38.974 --> 08:40.974
No worries.

08:45.374 --> 08:48.974
That's a different crone.
No. Same crone. Different day.
Definitely the same.

08:49.014 --> 08:51.254
She's a bit...older.
We're all a bit older.

08:51.294 --> 08:52.934
And thinner. She's been working out.

08:52.974 --> 08:54.974
And she's only got one arm. Has she?

08:57.054 --> 08:59.294
Yeah...she lost it. Lost it?

08:59.334 --> 09:01.774
Yeah. Yesterday. You know,
you win some, you lose some.

09:01.814 --> 09:03.894
That phrase doesn't apply to arms.

09:03.934 --> 09:05.934
See you in the new year.

09:07.374 --> 09:09.374
Good effort. Come on, you.

09:11.014 --> 09:13.014
No, no, no. We said no win, no fee.

09:44.254 --> 09:47.054
Little man!

09:47.094 --> 09:49.094
Can I help you with something?

09:50.774 --> 09:52.774
Have you got a doggy bag?

09:54.054 --> 09:56.134
We don't need them.
We hit the Forum anyway.

09:56.174 --> 09:59.334
Find some other girls,
wait for the gong and pounce.

09:59.374 --> 10:02.054
Really? Pounce?
Yeah. Pounce like a cat.

10:02.094 --> 10:04.374
Or like a rapist. More like a cat.

10:04.414 --> 10:07.094
Listen. Why don't you come
to the homeless shelter with me?

10:07.134 --> 10:09.414
They always need a hand.
They always need a handjob?

10:09.454 --> 10:14.414
Do you give out handjobs?
No, I - OK. You can take the piss
as much as you want,

10:14.454 --> 10:16.934
but the work that these guys do
is really important.

10:16.974 --> 10:20.774
I feel proud
to spend Saturnalia making
a difference to people's lives.

10:20.814 --> 10:23.454
Quick question. Do you want
to come to my Saturnalia party?

10:23.494 --> 10:25.974
Oh, yes. Yes, please.
Whoa, what about the homeless?

10:26.014 --> 10:28.294
I can rearrange.
You can rearrange homelessness?

10:28.334 --> 10:30.374
It's OK.
They're used to disappointment.

10:30.414 --> 10:35.574
You two? Or will you be too busy
drinking yourselves blind
and laying in your own throw-up.

10:35.614 --> 10:37.254
We'd love to come. Marvellous.

10:37.294 --> 10:38.974
Well, come around seven
and, er...

10:39.014 --> 10:42.174
Don't take this the wrong way,
but have you got any nice clothes?

10:42.214 --> 10:44.454
I think so.
I can rent something. Exactly.

10:44.494 --> 10:46.494
And maybe try brushing your teeth.

10:48.214 --> 10:50.774
Yes, I'm in!

10:50.814 --> 10:53.054
It's taken five years
but I'm finally in.

11:08.759 --> 11:12.639
So... The Centurion there
wants to bang you up.

11:12.787 --> 11:14.907
Ah, jizz.

11:14.947 --> 11:18.307
But I have told him
it ain't going to happen.

11:18.347 --> 11:20.147
So, he's backing off.

11:20.187 --> 11:22.187
Wicked. Ta.

11:22.227 --> 11:25.347
He doesn't get how hard it is
for guys like you.

11:25.387 --> 11:27.987
You know, you're driven to this.
You need to eat.

11:28.027 --> 11:31.267
I really do.
Because if people are so hungry,

11:31.307 --> 11:33.667
if their situation is so dire,

11:33.707 --> 11:36.227
that they need to steal
religious offerings,

11:36.267 --> 11:38.867
then that, my friend,
is the fault of society.

11:38.907 --> 11:41.187
Bloody society.

11:41.227 --> 11:42.867
We're going to look after you here.

11:42.907 --> 11:45.827
So, you don't need to feel
scared or hungry any more.

11:45.867 --> 11:48.467
OK, cool.

11:48.507 --> 11:50.507
I'm more hungry than scared but...

11:55.707 --> 11:57.747
What's she doing out? Cynthia!

11:57.787 --> 11:59.547
Oh, hey. There you are.

11:59.587 --> 12:01.827
Guess what. It's happened.
What's happened?

12:01.867 --> 12:04.027
The accident. It's happened?

12:04.067 --> 12:06.627
You know there's damp in the flats?
The water feature.

12:06.667 --> 12:10.667
Well, it finally got too damp
and this whole chunk of ceiling
came crashing down.

12:10.707 --> 12:13.987
It's brilliant.
Some call it brilliant,
others criminal negligence.

12:14.027 --> 12:16.747
I'll go for brilliant. I asked
you to deal with that ages ago.

12:16.787 --> 12:20.387
Good job I didn't.
Or I could have had an even worse
accident down the line.

12:20.427 --> 12:23.307
There you go. So, anyway,
we're now hugely pumped for tonight.

12:23.347 --> 12:26.107
You guys are still free, right?

12:26.147 --> 12:28.147
Er...

12:32.147 --> 12:33.987
What time did you say
we'd meet the girls?

12:34.027 --> 12:36.387
Nine. At the doughnut stand.
OK, perfect.

12:36.427 --> 12:39.307
We'll put in some quality face time
at Flavia's and then raz over.

12:39.347 --> 12:42.187
We're just popping in, right?
We'll pop for like an hour. Max.

12:42.227 --> 12:44.147
OK, well, we've gotta go. Grumio?

12:44.187 --> 12:46.347
We're off, mate.

12:46.387 --> 12:49.547
And you're wearing a crown, are you?
I am, yes.

12:49.587 --> 12:52.867
Have you seen Grumio?
Did we...put him somewhere?

12:58.707 --> 13:00.547
He abuses you?

13:00.587 --> 13:03.027
Your master? He makes me do stuff.

13:03.067 --> 13:04.907
Hmmm. Hmmm.

13:04.947 --> 13:09.267
What kind of stuff?
Shopping, cleaning - Sex acts?

13:09.307 --> 13:11.947
Any sexual abuse of any kind?

13:11.987 --> 13:15.227
More your verbals.
Dissing and that. Hmmm, hmmm.

13:15.267 --> 13:18.827
A lot of the other guys
were also raped by their masters.

13:18.867 --> 13:21.387
Oh, not raped. No.
Or they're in denial.

13:22.547 --> 13:25.827
We have a little saying here
at the Temple of Sibyli.

13:25.867 --> 13:29.827
If you don't admit it's real,
you're never gonna heal.

13:29.867 --> 13:33.147
Hmmm? Hmmm. Hmmm!

13:41.507 --> 13:43.587
Sorry, I don't know
what's going on. No, OK.

13:43.627 --> 13:47.267
I think you should
have a little read of this.
It'll tell you about the mission.

13:47.307 --> 13:49.987
I think you're gonna
really vibe with it.

13:50.027 --> 13:53.787
All finished?
Yes. Thank you, Brother Laurence.
Thank you, Brother Quintus.

13:53.827 --> 13:57.067
Now, Grumio,
are you ready for your rub down?

14:00.987 --> 14:03.227
I think we might be early.
She said seven.

14:05.827 --> 14:09.467
Look at you, Shredder.
That crown is just divine.

14:09.507 --> 14:11.507
In you come.

14:15.867 --> 14:18.507
Sorry, are we early?
No, no. You're just in time.

14:18.547 --> 14:21.587
The guests will be arriving
any moment. And here we are.

14:22.547 --> 14:24.907
What do you mean guests?
Are we not - Nooo.

14:24.947 --> 14:28.867
Copier, if you
follow Water boy around
giving out the canapes, there.

14:28.907 --> 14:32.587
Right. Water man.
Do try to distribute the food
as effectively as possible

14:32.627 --> 14:35.307
because there are a couple of
fat fucks in business affairs

14:35.347 --> 14:38.027
that'll attempt to hem you in
and snaffle the lot.

14:38.067 --> 14:41.427
Do not let them succeed.
Yes, sorry. I hadn't realised.

14:41.467 --> 14:43.827
What? That we were working. Yes.

14:43.867 --> 14:47.107
Cos, er...
What time will we knock off?

14:47.147 --> 14:50.067
The guests will leave shortly
after midnight, you do the tidy up,

14:50.107 --> 14:52.987
I check you haven't stolen anything
and you can be on your way.

14:53.027 --> 14:54.787
Ah, it's just...

14:54.827 --> 14:57.547
We were hoping to go to the Forum
for the gong.

14:57.587 --> 14:59.747
Oh, if you want to leave
at any time, you can.

14:59.787 --> 15:02.587
But don't bother coming back
to work on Monday, OK?

15:03.467 --> 15:05.427
So, am I doing canapes, then?

15:05.467 --> 15:07.147
No, no. You follow me, Shredder.

15:07.187 --> 15:10.827
I have something a little more
special...planned for you. Right.

15:15.387 --> 15:17.747
How's this? Yeah, good.

15:17.787 --> 15:19.787
Can you go a bit higher? Like that?

15:21.187 --> 15:22.827
Oh, yeah.

15:22.867 --> 15:25.227
Yep. That's class, that is.

15:25.267 --> 15:27.267
Ohhh.

15:38.747 --> 15:40.747
Whoa there. OK.

15:41.827 --> 15:44.307
What are these, please?
Er, fig rolls.

15:44.347 --> 15:47.547
And what's this, please?
That's strawberries and cream.

15:52.027 --> 15:53.987
How is it? How d'you think it is?

15:54.027 --> 15:56.787
Creamy. We need to
get out of here, man.

15:56.827 --> 15:58.427
Some of the guests are - Oi!

15:58.467 --> 16:00.227
Oh. Sorry.

16:00.267 --> 16:02.267
Not there. You can't swipe there.

16:02.307 --> 16:04.307
That's where the most cream is.
Yeah, even so.

16:04.347 --> 16:07.387
In the cleft.
Stay away from the cleft.

16:11.907 --> 16:15.667
You see what I'm saying?
Some people aren't even bothering
with the strawberries.

16:15.707 --> 16:17.987
OK, we need to get out of here.
I know, but how? I dunno.

16:18.027 --> 16:20.227
Maybe sneak out? What? Sneak out?

16:20.267 --> 16:23.867
I think people might notice
if the cream covered
human statue tries to sneak out.

16:23.907 --> 16:26.787
Copier! Circulate.
Yeah, sorry. I am.

16:28.427 --> 16:30.427
So many options.

16:34.147 --> 16:35.747
How's it going? Rubbish.

16:35.787 --> 16:37.827
It's like being at work,
but in a rented toga.

16:37.867 --> 16:39.947
It's nearly ten. This is dog shit.

16:39.987 --> 16:42.867
We can't stay here all night.
We can't leave. She'll fire us.

16:42.907 --> 16:46.387
If we get to the Forum
there'll be the gong and people -
No, it's not worth it.

16:46.427 --> 16:48.587
We're meeting some girls.
Hot girls? Yes.

16:48.627 --> 16:52.067
Hot girls. So, listen. I don't like
you and you don't like me, but if -

16:52.107 --> 16:53.827
I do like you.

16:53.867 --> 16:56.987
OK. Well... We need to work together.
You don't like me?

16:57.027 --> 16:59.587
Er - Why don't you like me?
We're getting bogged down now.

16:59.627 --> 17:01.907
I thought you liked me. I do.
You just said you didn't.

17:01.947 --> 17:03.867
It's a phrase.
Not for when you like someone.

17:03.907 --> 17:06.666
Hey! I think you're great, Aurelius.

17:06.707 --> 17:11.146
So, why did you just say -
Now, help us get out of here
and you can meet the hot girls.

17:11.987 --> 17:15.587
OK, deal. What's the plan? Cool.
We need to stop the party somehow.

17:15.627 --> 17:18.107
Start a fire?
Oh! I've got an amazing idea.

17:18.146 --> 17:21.146
OK, what is it?
Right, we start a big old ruckus.

17:21.186 --> 17:24.707
Keep talking. So, I'm pretty
sure that Julia, from reception,

17:24.747 --> 17:29.387
is having an affair with Balbo,
the Communications Director,
who's married to Livia, from admin.

17:29.427 --> 17:33.147
If you tell Sexstus,
from compliance, that Livia
has been shagging Ambrosius,

17:33.187 --> 17:36.347
and I'll tell Julia
that Sexstus has been
getting it on with Abana, from HR,

17:36.387 --> 17:38.907
and this place
will get pretty f-ing nasty.

17:38.947 --> 17:43.267
Right. Definitely?
Well, at the very least,
the atmosphere will be awful.

17:43.307 --> 17:45.627
Cos I was thinking
you could diddle the water clock

17:45.667 --> 17:48.147
and we could bring midnight
forward an hour.

17:48.187 --> 17:51.667
Yeah. Let's do that.

18:07.107 --> 18:09.027
Right, well...

18:09.067 --> 18:11.587
Thanks for the rub down
and the scroll and that.

18:11.627 --> 18:15.867
Well, may Sibyli bless you
on your holy journey.

18:15.907 --> 18:19.627
May...he...bless you -
Is it a he or she?

18:19.667 --> 18:21.347
Have you read the scroll?

18:21.387 --> 18:23.627
Hmmm. Hmmm? Hmmm?

18:23.667 --> 18:25.467
It's a she, ain't it? Mm-hm.

18:25.507 --> 18:27.667
Cos of the boobs.

18:27.707 --> 18:32.147
Well, if you want to just
pop on to the back of the cart there
with the other trainees.

18:32.187 --> 18:35.027
Oh, right.
Are we gonna get dropped off, then?

18:35.067 --> 18:36.827
I were just gonna walk it.

18:36.867 --> 18:38.787
Precious. No, no, no.

18:38.827 --> 18:40.827
Up you pop.

18:45.467 --> 18:47.987
It's time! Everybody, let's go!

18:48.027 --> 18:51.267
10... Is it midnight already?

18:51.307 --> 18:53.987
7...6...5...

18:56.427 --> 18:59.147
Sorry, which way are we going?
Cos I live back that way.

18:59.187 --> 19:03.107
We're heading to the docks.
It'll only take a couple of hours.

19:03.147 --> 19:07.587
Right, don't mean to be
a backseat driver or nothing, but
that is a bit of a long way round.

19:07.627 --> 19:11.387
My gaff's up there.
Well, first the docks,
and then on to Cyprus. Hmmm?

19:11.427 --> 19:13.067
Hmmm.

19:13.107 --> 19:15.867
W-What's all this about Cyprus?
Cyprus.

19:15.907 --> 19:19.387
Where you'll be castrated
and continue to train
at the Graduate Palace. Hmmm?

19:19.427 --> 19:21.747
Right. Palace. Oh.

19:21.787 --> 19:23.907
That sounds... Is it hot, Cyprus?

19:23.947 --> 19:27.347
Cyprus? Oh, very hot. Yes. Very hot.

19:27.387 --> 19:29.147
Like, nice hot? Not too hot, hot?

19:29.187 --> 19:31.307
No, no, no. Not too hot, hot.
Nice hot, hot.

19:31.347 --> 19:34.627
Oh, yes. Right. Hmmm. Hmmm.

19:34.667 --> 19:36.587
Cool.

19:36.627 --> 19:38.627
And what's castrated, again?

20:02.347 --> 20:04.307
Doughnuts!

20:05.507 --> 20:07.307
Where are they?
I was promised hot girls.

20:07.347 --> 20:09.187
They should be here,
by the doughnut seller.

20:09.227 --> 20:12.427
Excuse me, mate. Are there any other
doughnut sellers in the Forum?

20:12.467 --> 20:14.907
What's wrong
with my doughnuts? Nothing.

20:14.947 --> 20:17.227
Salve, Marcus. Landlord.

20:17.267 --> 20:19.787
Ready for the frenzy?
Yeah, they've not hit the gong yet?

20:19.827 --> 20:21.867
No, any moment now. Brace yourselves.

20:21.907 --> 20:24.747
Listen. Have you seen Cynthia?
Haven't seen bugger all, mate.

20:24.787 --> 20:29.307
I had these mushrooms
that have given me bat-shit mental
hallucinations and stomach cramps.

20:29.347 --> 20:31.147
Do you want some? No, thanks. I will.

20:31.187 --> 20:33.867
Ah, good lad. Covered in cream, then?

20:33.907 --> 20:36.227
Yep. Classic.

20:36.267 --> 20:40.187
Are there any other doughnut
sellers, Landlord? In the Forum?

20:40.227 --> 20:42.187
Landlord?

20:42.227 --> 20:43.907
Doughnut sellers?

20:43.947 --> 20:45.587
Shitloads, mate.

20:45.627 --> 20:48.987
But I've been having these quadruple
visions, or something, so who knows?

20:49.027 --> 20:51.147
Good luck with that.

20:51.187 --> 20:53.627
Thanks for the mushrooms.
Yeah, no problem.

21:01.627 --> 21:03.907
Doughnuts!

21:03.947 --> 21:06.947
Hey, Cynthia! Oh, wow. You found us!

21:06.987 --> 21:10.707
Yeah, hi. Sorry. We got a bit lost -
And covered in cream.
I got covered in cream, yes.

21:10.747 --> 21:13.147
Lovely to meet you, I'm Aurelius.
All set for the gong?

21:13.187 --> 21:16.907
Oh, it's my favourite instrument.
I'm Aurelius. All right, mate.
Back off. What?

21:16.947 --> 21:19.587
Oh, this is so exciting!
Here we go again.

21:19.627 --> 21:21.547
10...9...

21:21.587 --> 21:24.387
8...7...6...

21:24.427 --> 21:26.747
5...4...3...

21:26.787 --> 21:29.227
2...1... Marcus!

21:29.267 --> 21:31.147
Grumio?

21:31.187 --> 21:33.187
Marcus!

21:39.147 --> 21:41.147
Happy New Year!

21:42.227 --> 21:43.827
You, too, mate.

21:43.867 --> 21:45.867
You, too.

21:58.747 --> 22:00.747
Shit!
