WEBVTT

00:11.645 --> 00:13.847
- AH, WELL,

BTR'S WHIRLWIND WORLD TOUR
IS OFFICIALLY OVER.

00:17.818 --> 00:19.253
- AND NOW IT'S BACK
TO THE PALMWOODS,

00:19.253 --> 00:20.788
WHERE THE NEW KIDS
HAVE MOVED IN,

00:20.788 --> 00:22.090
AND NONE OF THEM
WILL KNOW US.

00:22.090 --> 00:24.758
- WHICH MEANS
WE HAVE TO REESTABLISH

00:24.758 --> 00:28.429
OUR BIG TIME POOL, LOBBY,
AND HALLWAY CRED

00:28.429 --> 00:30.131
ALL OVER AGAIN.

00:30.131 --> 00:31.799
- I HATE REESTABLISHING CRED.

00:31.799 --> 00:32.966
- HEY.

00:32.966 --> 00:35.469
AFTER FOUR CONTINENTS
AND OUR HOTEL ROOMS

00:35.469 --> 00:38.406
BEING BROKEN INTO 19 TIMES,
I'M LOOK FORWARD TO A LITTLE

00:38.406 --> 00:42.376
"NOBODY KNOWS US
AT THE PALMWOODS" RELAXING TIME.

00:44.245 --> 00:46.247
all:
WELCOME BACK!

00:46.247 --> 00:47.815
[cheers and applause]

00:47.815 --> 00:50.484
[noisemakers rattling,
horns blowing]

00:50.484 --> 00:52.920
- HUH, MAYBE THINGS
WILL BE DIFFERENT THIS SEASON.

00:52.920 --> 00:53.921
[horn beeps]

00:53.921 --> 00:55.489
- AND HERE'S BIG TIME RUSH.

00:55.489 --> 00:58.626
NOW WOULD BE A GOOD TIME TO USE
YOUR COMPLIMENTARY SCISSORS

00:58.626 --> 01:00.228
TO GET SOME SOUVENIR HAIR.

01:00.228 --> 01:02.130
all:

01:02.130 --> 01:05.133

01:09.970 --> 01:11.805

01:13.707 --> 01:17.911
- * WHEN YOU GO BIG TIME

01:17.911 --> 01:19.780
- * WHAT YOU WANT,
WHAT YOU FEEL *

01:19.780 --> 01:21.582
* NEVER QUIT
AND MAKE IT REAL *

01:21.582 --> 01:24.852
- * WHEN YOU ROLL BIG TIME

01:24.852 --> 01:25.953
- * OH-OH, OH-OH

01:25.953 --> 01:27.755

* IT'S THE ONLY LIFE YOU GOT
SO YOU GOT TO LIVE IT BIG TIME *

01:57.084 --> 01:58.886
- KEEP GOING! GO!

01:58.886 --> 02:00.921
[horn beeps]

02:01.989 --> 02:03.691
- JUST A SECOND,
AND LET ME, UH,

02:03.691 --> 02:05.092
JUST BACK THE VEHICLE UP,

02:05.092 --> 02:07.661
AND WE'LL CONTINUE ON
WITH THE BIG TIME EXPERIENCE.

02:07.661 --> 02:10.631
- WHAT IS GOING ON
AROUND HERE?

02:10.631 --> 02:12.633
- ONE, YOU'RE FAMOUS NOW.

02:12.633 --> 02:15.102
AND TWO, I'M JEALOUS
THAT BITTERS THOUGHT

02:15.102 --> 02:17.104
OF THE BIG TIME EXPERIENCE
BEFORE I DID.

02:17.104 --> 02:18.206
[horn beeps]

02:18.206 --> 02:19.407
- AND THREE, WELCOME-HOME HUG!

02:22.210 --> 02:24.878
- AND CAMILLE WILL BE CRASHING
DOWN THE DOOR ANY SECOND

02:24.878 --> 02:27.415
FOR HER WELCOME-HOME TACKLE.

02:27.415 --> 02:29.350
AND THIS YEAR,
I'M GONNA LET HER.

02:29.350 --> 02:31.319
- WAIT. SO YOU WANT TO GO OUT
WITH CAMILLE AGAIN?

02:31.319 --> 02:32.686
- YUP.

02:32.686 --> 02:34.788
BUT I'M GOING TO LET HER
MAKE THE FIRST MOVE,

02:34.788 --> 02:37.658
THUS PROTECTING MYSELF
FROM THE DATING DISADVANTAGE

02:37.658 --> 02:41.229
OF BEING THE PURSUER
INSTEAD OF THE PURSUEE.

02:41.229 --> 02:42.596
IT'S LOVE SCIENCE.

02:42.596 --> 02:43.964
- IT'S SOMETHING.

02:51.539 --> 02:52.940
- HUH.

02:52.940 --> 02:55.543
WELL, SHE MUCH HAVE FORGOT
WHAT TIME WE WERE ARRIVING.

02:55.543 --> 02:57.811
SO A LITTLE KNOCK ON THE DOOR
MIGHT HELP REMIND HER.

02:57.811 --> 02:59.480
- BUT IF YOU KNOCK
ON HER DOOR,

02:59.480 --> 03:02.082
ISN'T THAT YOU
MAKING THE FIRST MOVE?

03:02.082 --> 03:04.852
- DON'T QUESTION LOVE SCIENCE.

03:08.756 --> 03:10.123
[horn beeps]

03:10.123 --> 03:12.059
- AND THERE'S LOGAN NOW.

03:13.394 --> 03:15.863
- SPEAKING OF LOVE,
NOW THAT BTR IS FAMOUS

03:15.863 --> 03:17.265
AND HAS A TOP TEN HIT,

03:17.265 --> 03:19.433
THE JENNIFERS
WILL TOTALLY DATE ME.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.269
- ISN'T THAT KIND OF SHALLOW?

03:21.269 --> 03:22.570
- YEAH.

03:22.570 --> 03:24.272
BYE!

03:24.272 --> 03:25.273
- HUH.

03:25.273 --> 03:27.508
WITH CARLOS PURSUING
THE JENS,

03:27.508 --> 03:29.277
THAT LEAVES ME WITH SOLE DIBS

03:29.277 --> 03:30.678
ON THE LOVE OF MY LIFE:

03:30.678 --> 03:31.879
LUCY.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.947
- LUCY IS THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE?

03:33.947 --> 03:37.751
- WELL, SHE'S SMART AND HOT,
SO YEAH.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.420
- WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
IF I TOLD YOU

03:39.420 --> 03:42.556
THAT SHE WINKED AT ME
BEFORE WE LEFT FOR TOUR,

03:42.556 --> 03:44.492
YOU KNOW, WHEN WE SANG
BY THE POOL?

03:44.492 --> 03:47.194
- I WOULD SAY SHE PROBABLY
HAD SOMETHING IN HER EYE

03:47.194 --> 03:50.030
AND DIDN'T WINK AT YOU.

03:50.030 --> 03:51.332
- OKAY, SWEETIE, LET'S GO.

03:51.332 --> 03:52.600
- BUT I THINK
THEY'RE GONNA FIGHT.

03:57.371 --> 04:01.542
- ALL I'M SAYING IS,
IS THAT SHE WINKED AT ME.

04:01.542 --> 04:04.378
- AND ALL I'M SAYING
IS THAT YOU SHOULD FOLLOW

04:04.378 --> 04:06.179
THE RULE OF DIBS,

04:06.179 --> 04:07.781
WHICH STATES
THAT THE FIRST PERSON

04:07.781 --> 04:09.383
TO UTTER THE WORD "DIBS"

04:09.383 --> 04:11.485
HAS PROPRIETARY CLAIM
ON ALL

04:11.485 --> 04:12.786
CAR SEATING, REMOTE CONTROLS,

04:12.786 --> 04:15.523
FOUND MONEY, TASTY SNACK FOOD,
AND GIRLS.

04:15.523 --> 04:16.524
- W--

04:16.524 --> 04:18.326
- ANY VIOLATION OF SAID RULE

04:18.326 --> 04:21.329
WILL RESULT IN THE VIOLATOR
HAVING TO RUN ONE HALF MILE

04:21.329 --> 04:24.465
THROUGH A CROWDED PUBLIC AREA
IN HIS UNDERWEAR.

04:24.465 --> 04:26.199
ANYTHING ELSE?

04:26.199 --> 04:28.336
I DIDN'T THINK SO.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.344
- WHOA, WHOA,
WAIT A MINUTE!

04:36.344 --> 04:38.479
WAIT!
HEY, WHERE ARE YOU TAKING ME?

04:38.479 --> 04:39.480
HEY, HELP ME!

04:40.714 --> 04:42.182
OKAY, WHAT--

04:42.182 --> 04:44.718
WHERE ARE YOU TAKING ME?

04:44.718 --> 04:45.986
- HELLO, CARLOS.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.054
WELCOME BACK.

04:47.054 --> 04:48.522
- GRIFFIN?

04:48.522 --> 04:50.023
YOU COULD HAVE JUST CALLED,
YOU KNOW.

04:50.023 --> 04:52.960
- NO, I ALWAYS PREFER
TO DO BUSINESS FACE-TO-FACE

04:52.960 --> 04:54.161
WITH SACKS.

04:54.161 --> 04:56.664
- OKAY, WELL,
IT WAS GREAT TO SEE YOU.

04:56.664 --> 04:57.698
BUT I NEED TO RETURN TO--

04:57.698 --> 04:59.099
- WHAT UP, YO?

04:59.099 --> 05:02.135
IT'S JOJO ON THE RADIO,
AND TOMORROW, BIG TIME RUSH

05:02.135 --> 05:04.538
IS GONNA BE HERE LIVE
TO DEBUT THEIR NEW SINGLE.

05:04.538 --> 05:05.973
- SWEET.

05:05.973 --> 05:08.409
- EVEN SWEETER, GUSTAVO AND I
HAVE DECIDED TO LET YOU

05:08.409 --> 05:11.512
PICK WHICH BIG TIME SONG
JOJO PLAYS.

05:11.512 --> 05:14.081
- GREAT, UM, OKAY.

05:14.081 --> 05:15.215
I-I PICK, UH--

05:15.215 --> 05:16.950
- LOVE ME, LOVE ME,
I AGREE.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.419
LET'S GO TELL GUSTAVO.

05:18.419 --> 05:20.721
- WAIT.
I THOUGHT THAT I WAS GONNA PICK.

05:20.721 --> 05:21.822
- YOU ARE,

05:21.822 --> 05:23.657
AS LONG AS IT'S
LOVE ME, LOVE ME.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.192
- * LOVE ME, LOVE ME

05:25.192 --> 05:27.027
* SAY YOU'RE GONNA LOVE ME *

05:27.027 --> 05:28.662
* I KNOW YOU'RE READY TO GO *

05:28.662 --> 05:30.230
* I-I'M READY TO GO *

05:32.032 --> 05:33.501
- BUT IF YOU KNOCK
ON HER DOOR,

05:33.501 --> 05:35.603
ISN'T THAT YOU
MAKING THE FIRST MOVE?

05:41.174 --> 05:43.043
[pounding on door]

05:44.445 --> 05:46.113
- JIMBO, WHAT'S UP?

05:46.113 --> 05:47.481
IT'S SO GOOD TO BE BACK.

05:47.481 --> 05:49.817
BIG TIME RUSH IS BACK.

05:49.817 --> 05:51.051
WHOO!

05:51.051 --> 05:53.053
- I'M CALLING THE COPS.

05:53.053 --> 05:54.154
- WHAT?

05:56.424 --> 05:58.759
- LOGAN?

05:58.759 --> 05:59.893
- HELLO, CAMILLE.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.465
- SO YOU GUYS GOT BACK TODAY.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.935
- YEAH, GOT BACK TODAY.

06:07.935 --> 06:10.538
LET ME JUST SAY
IT IS SO GOOD TO BE BACK.

06:11.605 --> 06:14.107
- GREAT.

06:14.107 --> 06:15.175
- GREAT.

06:15.175 --> 06:16.577
GREAT, GREAT.

06:16.577 --> 06:19.346
[siren wailing]

06:19.346 --> 06:21.449
WELL, I SHOULD BE GOING.

06:21.449 --> 06:23.116
- OKAY.

06:23.116 --> 06:24.852
- SEE YOU AROUND.

06:24.852 --> 06:28.188
- OKAY, I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.

06:28.188 --> 06:30.491
- I REALLY WANT TO TACKLE HIM.

06:30.491 --> 06:31.825
- NO.

06:31.825 --> 06:33.927
LOGAN HAS TO MAKE THE FIRST MOVE
THIS TIME.

06:33.927 --> 06:36.764
YOU ALWAYS MAKE THE FIRST MOVE,
AND WHAT'S IT GOTTEN YOU?

06:36.764 --> 06:39.733
- AN ON-AGAIN, OFF-AGAIN ROMANCE
FILLED WITH QUESTION MARKS

06:39.733 --> 06:40.901
AND NO COMMITMENT.

06:40.901 --> 06:41.935
- JUST TRUST ME.

06:41.935 --> 06:42.970
IT'S LOVE SCIENCE.

06:42.970 --> 06:44.572
OH, HEY,
I'LL BE ON CHANNEL FOUR

06:44.572 --> 06:46.940
IF YOU HAVE ANY MORE
MAN OR BATHROOM PROBLEMS

06:46.940 --> 06:48.909
OR MAN-IN-THE-BATHROOM PROBLEMS.

06:51.712 --> 06:53.080
- LUCY.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.615
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT

06:54.615 --> 06:55.749
ALL TOUR LONG,

06:55.749 --> 06:58.351
BESIDES,
"DOES THIS HAVE NUTS IN IT?"

06:58.351 --> 06:59.720
YOU.

06:59.720 --> 07:02.022
- SAY NO MORE.

07:02.022 --> 07:03.524
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

07:13.300 --> 07:14.301
both:
OH!

07:15.769 --> 07:17.538
- HI.

07:17.538 --> 07:18.972
- HI.

07:21.742 --> 07:24.512
- SO HOW WAS YOUR TOUR?

07:24.512 --> 07:26.514
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD ASK JAMES
ABOUT THAT.

07:26.514 --> 07:28.516
- I WOULD,
BUT HE'S CRUSHING ON ME AGAIN,

07:28.516 --> 07:30.918
AND YOU'RE NOT CRUSHING ON ME,
WHICH MEANS WE CAN HAVE,

07:30.918 --> 07:33.654
YOU KNOW,
AN INTELLIGENT CONVERSATION.

07:33.654 --> 07:35.889
- YEAH, CAN'T DO THAT RIGHT NOW.

07:35.889 --> 07:36.990
- WHY NOT?

07:36.990 --> 07:38.391
- BECAUSE THEN I'D HAVE TO RUN

07:38.391 --> 07:40.661
A HALF MILE THROUGH A CROWD
IN MY UNDERWEAR.

07:40.661 --> 07:43.163
- [laughs]

07:43.163 --> 07:44.698
OH, MY GOD, YOU'RE SERIOUS.

07:46.534 --> 07:48.335
WHY ARE YOU ALL SO WEIRD?

07:48.335 --> 07:49.870
[horn beeps]

07:49.870 --> 07:52.139
- AND ON YOUR RIGHT,
A POSSIBLE FUTURE LOVE INTEREST

07:52.139 --> 07:54.675
FOR KENDALL AND/OR JAMES.

07:54.675 --> 07:56.910
[camera shutters clicking]

07:56.910 --> 08:00.113
- CARLOS, I WAS JUST
GONNA CALL YOU.

08:00.113 --> 08:02.950
GRIFFIN AND I ALWAYS ARGUE
OVER WHICH NEW SONG TO RELEASE,

08:02.950 --> 08:05.686
SO WE'VE DECIDED
TO LET YOU PICK IT.

08:05.686 --> 08:08.722
- BECAUSE YOU ARE
THE MOST HONEST PERSON WE KNOW.

08:08.722 --> 08:10.157
- I'M NOT ALWAYS HONEST.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.592
- SEE?

08:11.592 --> 08:14.762
- NOW, GRIFFIN WANTS
LOVE ME, LOVE ME,

08:14.762 --> 08:17.197
BUT I THINK OUR NEW HIT SONG
SHOULD BE ELEVATE.

08:17.197 --> 08:18.298
- I LIKE LOVE ME, LOVE ME.

08:18.298 --> 08:20.267
- NO, YOU DON'T.

08:20.267 --> 08:22.770
- YES, I DO.

08:22.770 --> 08:25.873
- YES, I DO.

08:25.873 --> 08:27.074
- WHY?

08:27.074 --> 08:28.408
- BECAUSE LOVE ME, LOVE ME

08:28.408 --> 08:29.943
CONNECTS TO TODAY'S 12-...

08:29.943 --> 08:33.581
- TO 21-YEAR-OLDS WHO POSSESS
THE MOST DISPOSABLE CASH,

08:33.581 --> 08:36.850
THUS SELLING MORE
BIG TIME RUSH MERCHANDISE.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.657
- [clears throat]

08:43.657 --> 08:45.458
both:
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

08:45.458 --> 08:48.228
- LOVE ME, LOVE ME
IS OUR NEXT BIG TIME HIT.

08:48.228 --> 08:50.097
- UH, NO.
ELEVATE IS.

08:50.097 --> 08:52.099
- LOVE ME, LOVE ME.
- ELEVATE.

08:52.099 --> 08:53.601
- LOVE ME, LOVE ME.
- ELEVATE!

08:53.601 --> 08:54.902
- HEY, HEY.

08:54.902 --> 08:57.104
DOESN'T ANYBODY WANT TO KNOW
WHAT I THINK

08:57.104 --> 08:58.405
THE NEXT HIT SHOULD BE?

08:58.405 --> 08:59.773
both:
NO!

09:02.042 --> 09:03.043
- NOW.

09:06.614 --> 09:08.181
- JUST MAKE THE FIRST MOVE.

09:08.181 --> 09:10.017
- KATIE, YOU KNOW NOTHING
OF TEEN LOVE.

09:10.017 --> 09:11.652
NOW, CAMILLE'S
COMING TO THE POOL

09:11.652 --> 09:12.853
TO READ SOME SCRIPTS,

09:12.853 --> 09:15.255
BUT INSTEAD,
SHE'S GONNA BE TACKLING ME.

09:26.667 --> 09:28.535
- HE'S GLOWING.

09:28.535 --> 09:30.237
- YOU CAN'T MAKE
THE FIRST MOVE.

09:31.872 --> 09:33.273
- BUT HE'S GLOWING.

09:33.273 --> 09:35.843
- SHIELD YOUR EYES
AND GET OUT OF THERE.

09:35.843 --> 09:37.277
RUN.

09:40.881 --> 09:44.117
- CAMILLE JUST WALKIE-TALKIE'D
TO SOMEONE AND THEN LEFT.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.486
- SOMEONE TOLD HER TO LEAVE ME?

09:46.486 --> 09:48.488
I JUST WANT TO BE TACKLED.

09:48.488 --> 09:49.690
[horn beeps]

09:49.690 --> 09:51.458
- OKAY, EVERYONE,
NOW WOULD BE A GREAT TIME

09:51.458 --> 09:53.861
TO GET OUT
AND TACKLE GLOWING LOGAN.

09:55.929 --> 09:56.930
- YOU SAW ME TALK TO HER.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.031
- YEAH, I DID.

09:58.031 --> 09:59.700
NOW RUN IN YOUR UNDERWEAR.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.034
- NO.

10:01.034 --> 10:03.070
BECAUSE SHE BUMPED INTO ME.

10:03.070 --> 10:04.672
DID WE KISS?
NO.

10:04.672 --> 10:07.841
AND MAYBE THE RULE OF DIBS
IS STUPID.

10:07.841 --> 10:09.042
- [gasps]

10:09.042 --> 10:12.179
WITHOUT RULES LIKE DIBS,
THERE'S ONLY CHAOS,

10:12.179 --> 10:13.213
TOTAL GIRL CHAOS,

10:13.213 --> 10:15.649
WHICH SOUNDS GOOD
BUT ISN'T.

10:15.649 --> 10:20.120
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT
IF I...

10:20.120 --> 10:21.321
UN-DIB-IFIED

10:21.321 --> 10:23.056
THE FRUIT PIE, CUPCAKE,
MINI DOUGHNUTS,

10:23.056 --> 10:26.794
AND PINKIE PUFFS THAT CARLOS,
LOGAN, AND ME, AND, OH, YOU

10:26.794 --> 10:28.261
CALLED DIBS ON
IN THE SEVENTH GRADE?

10:28.261 --> 10:30.230
- YOU PUT THOSE DOWN.
THOSE ARE MINE.

10:30.230 --> 10:32.332
- OH, I'LL STAY AWAY
FROM YOUR PINKIE PUFFS,

10:32.332 --> 10:34.067
AND YOU STAY AWAY
FROM MY LUCY.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.069
- FINE, I'LL STAY AWAY.

10:41.274 --> 10:42.542
DON'T TALK TO ME.

10:44.044 --> 10:46.446
- SO YOU CAN'T TALK TO ME
ANYMORE?

10:46.446 --> 10:48.716
YOU'RE SOME BIG STAR NOW
WHO DOESN'T HAVE ANY TIME

10:48.716 --> 10:50.017
FOR HIS FRIENDS?

10:51.451 --> 10:53.787
- JAMES HAS DIBS ON YOU.

10:53.787 --> 10:56.256
THAT'S WHY I CAN'T TALK
OR HANG OUT WITH YOU.

10:56.256 --> 10:58.025
- JAMES HAS DIBS ON ME?

10:58.025 --> 10:59.092
- SHH!

10:59.092 --> 11:00.828
- SO BIG TIME RUSH

11:00.828 --> 11:02.429
JUST PICKS OUT A GIRL

11:02.429 --> 11:04.798
AND DECIDES WHO THEY CAN
AND CANNOT DATE?

11:04.798 --> 11:06.166
- YEAH.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.568
BUT IT'S RULES
THAT PREVENT TOTAL GIRL CHAOS,

11:08.568 --> 11:10.403
WHICH SOUNDS GOOD,
BUT IT ISN'T.

11:10.403 --> 11:13.774
- WHAT IF I CALLED DIBS
ON YOU, HUH?

11:13.774 --> 11:15.375
- WELL, I GUESS
WE NEVER REALLY THOUGHT--

11:15.375 --> 11:17.577
- HEY, EVERYBODY.

11:17.577 --> 11:20.213
DIBS ON KENDALL.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.950
AND NO GIRL CAN TALK TO
OR LOOK AT HIM.

11:24.317 --> 11:26.053
MWAH!

11:26.053 --> 11:27.821
WHAT DO YOU GOT TO SAY
ABOUT THAT?

11:31.892 --> 11:35.028
- DO YOU MIND
HOLDING MY PANTS?

11:35.028 --> 11:37.164
- * AH, AH, AH-AH, OH
[girls screaming]

11:37.164 --> 11:38.465
- STOP IT! STOP IT!

11:38.465 --> 11:40.667
- YES, ON BITTERS'
BIG TIME EXPERIENCE,

11:40.667 --> 11:41.802
YOU SEE YOUR FAVORITE STARS

11:41.802 --> 11:44.037
LIKE YOU'VE NEVER
SEEN THEM BEFORE.

11:47.908 --> 11:49.042
- JOJO ON THE RADIO HERE.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.643
AND REMEMBER, TOMORROW,
BIG TIME RUSH.

11:50.643 --> 11:53.380
THEY'RE GONNA BE HERE LIVE
TO PLAY THEIR NEW SINGLE.

11:53.380 --> 11:57.951
- SO WHAT'S THAT SONG
GONNA BE, CARLOS?

11:57.951 --> 12:00.453
- WELL, IF IT WASN'T
FOR GUSTAVO,

12:00.453 --> 12:03.156
I'D STILL BE IN MINNESOTA
SHOVELING DRIVEWAYS.

12:03.156 --> 12:05.092
- YOU'RE DARN RIGHT YOU WOULD.

12:05.092 --> 12:06.960
- BUT I LOVE THE PONY
THAT GRIFFIN GOT ME.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.796
[horse neighs]

12:08.796 --> 12:10.563
- AND THERE'S MORE PONIES
WHERE THAT CAME FROM.

12:10.563 --> 12:11.799
- NOT FAIR.

12:11.799 --> 12:13.133
YOU'RE TRYING
TO BUY CARLOS' VOTE.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.134
- WRONG.

12:14.134 --> 12:15.435
I'M SIMPLY DOING BUSINESS,

12:15.435 --> 12:16.804
WITH PONIES.

12:16.804 --> 12:18.939
NOW, WHAT SONG'S IT GOING TO BE?

12:18.939 --> 12:20.240
LOVE ME, LOVE ME?

12:20.240 --> 12:21.608
- * SAY YOU'RE GONNA LOVE ME *

12:21.608 --> 12:23.176
[knuckles cracking]

12:23.176 --> 12:24.177
- OR ELEVATE?

12:24.177 --> 12:25.245
- * ELEVATE A LITTLE HIGHER

12:25.245 --> 12:26.179
[knuckles cracking]

12:31.218 --> 12:32.385
[horse neighs]

12:35.255 --> 12:37.290
- WILDFIRE, AWAY!

12:40.894 --> 12:45.298
- FOR THE LAST TIME,
I DON'T WANT TO DATE LUCY.

12:45.298 --> 12:47.100
BUT LUCY THINKS
WE SHOULD TAKE GIRLS

12:47.100 --> 12:49.702
OFF THE DIBS RULE,
AND MAYBE SHE'S RIGHT.

12:49.702 --> 12:52.672
- OH, YEAH, THEN YOU CAN GO
TELL HER HOW AMAZING SHE IS

12:52.672 --> 12:53.706
TO WIN HER LOVE.

12:53.706 --> 12:54.842
[laughs]

12:54.842 --> 12:56.910
PLUS, YOU NEED
ALL FOUR MEMBERS PRESENT

12:56.910 --> 12:58.846
TO REMOVE A DIB-ULATION.

12:58.846 --> 13:00.313
- HE'S RIGHT.

13:00.313 --> 13:02.215
- I WAS THERE WHEN YOU SIGNED
THAT STUPID THING.

13:02.215 --> 13:04.551
- AS YOU CAN SEE,
KENDALL AND JAMES

13:04.551 --> 13:06.753
ARE FIGHTING OVER A GIRL.

13:06.753 --> 13:09.256
AND IF YOU'LL ALL LOOK LEFT,

13:09.256 --> 13:13.126
THIS IS THE TIME
MOM USUALLY EXITS THE BATHROOM.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.762
- BITTERS!

13:15.762 --> 13:17.030
- AND THIS
IS THE PART OF THE TOUR

13:17.030 --> 13:18.131
WHERE WE LEAVE VERY QUICKLY.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.132
GO!

13:19.132 --> 13:20.067
[shouts]

13:21.534 --> 13:22.903
- KATIE, LET'S GO.

13:22.903 --> 13:25.873
- NO, I DON'T UNDERSTAND
TEEN LOVE, REMEMBER?

13:25.873 --> 13:27.574
- WE HAVE TO FIND OUT
WHO'S COACHING CAMILLE

13:27.574 --> 13:29.409
AND MEDDLING
WITH MY LOVE SCIENCE.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.511
NOW, GRAB A MEASURING CUP,
AND LET'S GO.

13:31.511 --> 13:32.980
- NO.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.182
COULD I TROUBLE YOU
FOR A CUP OF SUGAR?

13:35.182 --> 13:36.649
- OKAY.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.618
SURE.

13:38.618 --> 13:40.287
- [whistling]

13:40.287 --> 13:41.321
OH, HELLO.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.355
WHAT'S GOING ON?

13:42.355 --> 13:43.790
- LOGAN.

13:43.790 --> 13:45.058
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:45.058 --> 13:47.460
- OH, YOU KNOW,
PROBABLY JUST GONNA TACKLE

13:47.460 --> 13:48.896
SOME CHORES AROUND THE CRIB,

13:48.896 --> 13:50.663
MAYBE PLAY SOME TACKLE FOOTBALL,

13:50.663 --> 13:52.799
AND THEN AFTER THAT,
MAYBE DO SOME FISHING...

13:52.799 --> 13:55.235
WITH A TACKLE BOX.

13:55.235 --> 13:56.569
WELL, I'LL SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

13:56.569 --> 13:57.905
TACKLE.

13:59.139 --> 14:00.307
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:00.307 --> 14:01.909
FORGET ABOUT THE SUGAR.

14:03.776 --> 14:05.345
[static crackling]

14:05.345 --> 14:07.347
- I'M TELLING YOU,
HE'S TOO CUTE.

14:07.347 --> 14:10.583
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH MORE
OF THIS I CAN TAKE.

14:10.583 --> 14:13.253
- THINK ABOUT BOOGERS
HANGING OUT OF HIS NOSE

14:13.253 --> 14:15.923
AND KIND OF DANGLING
IN THE WIND.

14:15.923 --> 14:19.092
- BUDDHA BOB IS STOPPING
HER TACKLES OF LOVE?

14:19.092 --> 14:21.428
WELL, NOT FOR LONG!

14:23.196 --> 14:25.732
- HEY.

14:25.732 --> 14:27.067
HELLO.

14:36.109 --> 14:38.311
WILL YOU PLEASE UN-DIBS ME?

14:38.311 --> 14:41.048
NO GIRLS AT THE PALMWOODS
WILL EVEN LOOK OR TALK TO ME.

14:41.048 --> 14:44.651
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE TERM
"DIBS" STANDS FOR?

14:44.651 --> 14:46.186
"DEALER IDENTIFICATION BOOK,"

14:46.186 --> 14:48.055
AS IN, FARMERS
WOULD PUT A CHALK MARK

14:48.055 --> 14:50.390
ON THE BACK OF COWS
THAT WERE FOR SALE.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.758
AM I A COW TO YOU?

14:51.758 --> 14:54.361
- YOU'RE NOT A COW.

14:54.361 --> 14:55.495
YOU'RE GREAT.

14:55.495 --> 14:57.097
AND YOU'RE AN AWESOME
GUITAR PLAYER.

14:57.097 --> 14:58.365
AND YOU SPEAK YOUR MIND.

14:58.365 --> 14:59.466
- HECK, YEAH, I DO.

14:59.466 --> 15:01.969
- AND YOU'RE
KIND OF MYSTERIOUS.

15:01.969 --> 15:04.237
- OH, I'M VERY MYSTERIOUS.

15:04.237 --> 15:08.308
- AND YOU'RE A GOOD
CHEEK KISSER.

15:14.514 --> 15:15.848
- DO YOU NEED ME
TO HOLD YOUR PANTS?

15:15.848 --> 15:18.251
- YEAH.

15:18.251 --> 15:19.552
[girls screaming]

15:19.552 --> 15:21.989
- THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

15:23.190 --> 15:25.325
- MR. BITTERS.

15:25.325 --> 15:27.995
I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT YOUR LITTLE TOUR.

15:27.995 --> 15:30.230
- OF COURSE.

15:30.230 --> 15:31.831
NOW, TOUR, AT THIS MOMENT,
I'D LIKE YOU ALL

15:31.831 --> 15:34.534
TO HOLD ON TO THE HAND RAILINGS,
BECAUSE...

15:34.534 --> 15:37.004
[tires squealing]

15:37.004 --> 15:38.705
- WE'RE NOT DONE HERE.

15:41.841 --> 15:43.610
- WHY ARE YOU TELLING CAMILLE
TO AVOID ME?

15:43.610 --> 15:44.744
HUH?

15:44.744 --> 15:47.347
I WANT SOME ANSWERS NOW.

15:47.347 --> 15:49.782
- WELL, CLEARLY,
YOU HAVE COMMITMENT ISSUES,

15:49.782 --> 15:51.551
AND YOU'LL NEVER
BE A STEADY BOYFRIEND

15:51.551 --> 15:53.286
TILL YOU CONQUER
YOUR INSECURITIES

15:53.286 --> 15:55.555
AND YOUR FEAR OF REJECTION.

15:55.555 --> 15:58.358
- NOT THOSE ANSWERS.

15:58.358 --> 16:00.160
- LOGAN?

16:00.160 --> 16:01.261
IS THAT TRUE?

16:04.031 --> 16:06.833
- WHAT'S TRUE IS, EVERY TIME
I COME BACK FROM A LONG TRIP,

16:06.833 --> 16:08.035
YOU TACKLE ME,

16:08.035 --> 16:10.670
AND THIS TIME, YOU DIDN'T.

16:10.670 --> 16:14.774
- THAT'S BECAUSE THIS TIME,
I WANT THINGS TO BE DIFFERENT.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.878
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST TACKLE
EACH OTHER AT THE SAME TIME?

16:18.878 --> 16:22.049
THAT WAY, YOU BOTH
MAKE THE FIRST MOVE.

16:22.049 --> 16:23.116
[laughter]

16:23.116 --> 16:25.152
- TACKLE EACH OTHER
AT THE SAME TIME?

16:25.152 --> 16:26.219
- [laughs]

16:26.219 --> 16:27.554
KATIE, YOU'VE PROVED
ONCE AGAIN

16:27.554 --> 16:30.057
THAT YOU KNOW NOTHING
OF TEEN LOVE.

16:30.057 --> 16:32.359
- THAT'S NOT A TERRIBLE IDEA.

16:33.793 --> 16:36.796
[joyful orchestral music]

16:36.796 --> 16:44.737
*

16:52.379 --> 16:53.746
- WHOA!

16:53.746 --> 16:55.415
- OUCH, AH.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.621
- HE'S RIGHT.

17:01.621 --> 17:03.290
I DO NOT GET TEEN LOVE.

17:03.290 --> 17:04.291
- MM.

17:05.325 --> 17:06.959
- HEY, GUYS.

17:06.959 --> 17:08.095
[horse neighs]

17:11.431 --> 17:14.667
- WELL, IF IT ISN'T
THE DIB-SY TWINS.

17:14.667 --> 17:16.103
- GO ON.

17:16.103 --> 17:17.137
ASK HER.

17:17.137 --> 17:19.339
BECAUSE I AM DONE
RUNNING 95% NAKED

17:19.339 --> 17:20.607
THROUGH THE PALMWOODS.

17:22.475 --> 17:26.113
- LUCY, I HAVE BEEN THINKING
A LOT ABOUT YOU

17:26.113 --> 17:29.116
AND WAS WONDERING IF YOU
WOULD LIKE TO GO ON A DATE

17:29.116 --> 17:30.817
WITH ME.

17:33.853 --> 17:36.589
- YOU'RE REALLY SWEET, JAMES.

17:36.589 --> 17:38.758
BUT IT'S LIKE I SAID BEFORE.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.127
I GOT OUT
OF A MESSY RELATIONSHIP,

17:40.127 --> 17:41.828
AND I'M JUST NOT READY
FOR ANOTHER ONE.

17:41.828 --> 17:43.496
- SO IT'S NOT A NO.

17:43.496 --> 17:45.765
- OH, IT'S A NO.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.834
- RIGHT, BECAUSE
YOU LIKE KENDALL,

17:47.834 --> 17:50.137
AND YOU WINKED AT HIM
BEFORE WE LEFT FOR THE TOUR.

17:50.137 --> 17:51.938
- I NEVER WINKED AT KENDALL.

17:51.938 --> 17:54.141
- UH, YEAH, YOU DID.

17:54.141 --> 17:56.476
- I MIGHT HAVE HAD
SOME DUST IN MY EYE,

17:56.476 --> 17:58.578
BUT I NEVER WINKED AT YOU.

17:58.578 --> 18:01.781
- SO YOU DON'T WANT TO GO OUT
WITH KENDALL EITHER?

18:01.781 --> 18:03.583
- LET'S JUST SAY...

18:05.518 --> 18:08.054
KENDALL'S UNDIBBED.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.295
- WELL, GLAD
THERE'S NO MORE CONFUSION.

18:19.366 --> 18:20.900
- IS IT DUSTY OUT HERE?

18:20.900 --> 18:21.834
- NO.

18:27.207 --> 18:28.675
HELP US.

18:28.675 --> 18:30.910
- CAMILLE AND I
ARE DATING AGAIN.

18:30.910 --> 18:33.413
- AND GUSTAVO AND GRIFFIN
ARE GONNA KILL ME

18:33.413 --> 18:34.814
IF I DON'T PICK
THEIR FAVORITE SONG

18:34.814 --> 18:36.383
TO PLAY FOR JOJO ON THE RADIO.

18:36.383 --> 18:37.450
- THAT'S SIMPLE.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.619
JUST PICK THE SONG
YOU WANT TO PLAY.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.488
- OH, YEAH, I WOULD LOVE TO.

18:41.488 --> 18:42.622
BUT QUESTION:

18:42.622 --> 18:45.192
HOW DOES THAT SOLVE
THE "KILL ME" PART?

18:45.192 --> 18:46.793
both:
WE BRING HOCKEY STICKS.

18:49.529 --> 18:50.530
- GOOD MORNING, L.A.

18:50.530 --> 18:51.564

18:51.564 --> 18:52.932
IT'S JOJO ON THE RADIO

18:52.932 --> 18:55.067
IN THE STUDIO WITH KENDALL,
LOGAN, JAMES, AND CARLOS.

18:55.067 --> 18:58.605
CARLOS, I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE
BTR'S NEXT HIT SINGLE WITH YOU.

19:00.207 --> 19:02.108
- I GOT TO BE HONEST, JOJO.

19:02.108 --> 19:04.677
IT'S MY FAVORITE SONG
ON THE ALBUM.

19:04.677 --> 19:06.679
- WHICH IS LOVE ME, LOVE ME.
- WHICH IS ELEVATE.

19:06.679 --> 19:08.114
- LOVE ME, LOVE ME.
- ELEVATE.

19:08.114 --> 19:10.950
- LOVE ME, LOVE ME!
