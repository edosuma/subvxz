10:49.959 --> 10:51.754

- [Sophia] You're so precious.

12:52.806 --> 12:54.670
[Kevin laughs]

12:54.808 --> 12:57.500
[gentle music]

13:08.028 --> 13:09.271
- It's nice, right?
- Yes.

13:09.409 --> 13:12.377
- This is beautiful,
where are we?

13:12.515 --> 13:14.207
- You'll see.

13:14.345 --> 13:15.346
Okay, baby.

13:17.727 --> 13:18.832
- Wow.

13:19.937 --> 13:21.870
- It's crazy, right?
- It's amazing.

13:22.008 --> 13:23.388
- Huge.
- Wow.

13:25.770 --> 13:27.116
- You know what, you know what?

13:27.254 --> 13:28.808
I wonder how much
a house like this

13:28.946 --> 13:30.637
in a neighborhood
like this costs?

13:30.775 --> 13:32.777
- Mm, you know, actually, um,

13:32.915 --> 13:35.366
I spoke to the realtor and-
- Kevin!

13:35.504 --> 13:39.094
- Listen, if you want
it, then it's ours.

13:39.232 --> 13:41.096
[Sophia laughs]

13:41.234 --> 13:42.856
- No way.
- Yeah.

13:42.994 --> 13:43.995
- No way.
- Yeah.

13:44.133 --> 13:45.652
- I just wanted to give you

13:45.790 --> 13:48.344
the stability that you
always asked for, you know.

13:48.482 --> 13:50.001
And I just thought to myself,

13:50.139 --> 13:51.209
why have this big
wedding in a year.

13:51.347 --> 13:52.555
We can have like
a small wedding.

13:52.693 --> 13:54.005
- Yeah.

13:54.143 --> 13:56.042
- And then this
big beautiful crib

13:56.180 --> 13:58.251
could be the
reception, you know.

13:58.389 --> 14:01.116
- It'll also be
like a housewarming.

14:01.254 --> 14:02.531
- You're so amazing.

14:02.669 --> 14:04.429
- Wait, wait, so
what does that mean?

14:04.567 --> 14:05.741
That means yes, means I
like this, this our house?

14:05.879 --> 14:07.156
- Yeah, I love this [laughs].

14:07.294 --> 14:08.295
- Okay, let me show
you the kitchen,

14:08.433 --> 14:10.366
come on, come on [laughs].

14:10.504 --> 14:13.231
[gentle music]

14:19.203 --> 14:21.101
- There she is.

14:21.239 --> 14:23.207
Oh, my goodness, oh.

14:25.140 --> 14:28.246
- Oh, it's so good to see you.
- Hey, Mel what's going on?

14:28.384 --> 14:29.316
- Kev.

14:30.697 --> 14:32.457
- Look, make sure you take
care of my baby, okay.

14:32.595 --> 14:34.425
I need her in one piece when
she comes back, all right?

14:34.563 --> 14:35.875
- Oh, I will.

14:37.290 --> 14:39.568
- Mel, have you seen the
pics of the new house yet?

14:39.706 --> 14:40.880
- Yeah, it's beautiful.

14:41.018 --> 14:43.054
- Isn't it amazing?

14:43.192 --> 14:45.160
- But I thought you
wanted to live on a ranch,

14:45.298 --> 14:47.093
not some house in the city.

14:47.231 --> 14:49.819
- Yeah, that used to be my
dream, but when I was 14.

14:49.958 --> 14:50.959
- Oh, so now you all bougie

14:51.097 --> 14:53.030
and you done changed on me, huh?

14:53.168 --> 14:54.169
- Well.

14:54.307 --> 14:56.999
- What is that supposed to mean?

14:58.138 --> 14:59.243
- Nothing.

15:00.382 --> 15:02.971
- Babe, take a walk
with me, will you?

15:03.109 --> 15:05.214
Mel, can you watch my suitcase?

15:05.352 --> 15:07.320
Take a walk with me.

15:08.735 --> 15:10.012
She didn't really
mean anything by that.

15:10.150 --> 15:11.151
- Baby, yes, she did.

15:11.289 --> 15:12.704
It's obvious and you know that.

15:12.842 --> 15:15.949
- No, she just doesn't
know you yet like I do.

15:16.087 --> 15:17.675
- I don't trust her.
- Okay.

15:17.813 --> 15:20.609
- But will you trust me? Please?

15:22.749 --> 15:23.784
- You know you're
lucky you're cute.

15:23.923 --> 15:24.924
[Sophia laughs]

15:25.062 --> 15:26.373
Okay, it's the only reason why-

15:26.511 --> 15:27.685
- Okay, okay, all
right, you can talk

15:27.823 --> 15:28.686
about making babies later.

15:28.824 --> 15:29.687
Can we go, please?

15:29.825 --> 15:30.826
- I gotta go, babe.

15:30.964 --> 15:32.345
- Hello, we're on a time crunch.

15:32.483 --> 15:33.656
Got a time crunch, let's go.
- I love you.

15:33.794 --> 15:35.072
- Let's go.
- Okay.

15:35.210 --> 15:36.590
- Thank you.

15:36.728 --> 15:37.764
- Let's go, let's do this.
- All right.

15:37.902 --> 15:38.834
- You putting this away?

15:38.972 --> 15:40.353
- Yeah.
- Okay, awesome.

15:43.908 --> 15:45.220
- Hey, y'all.

15:51.364 --> 15:53.918
So, don't be mad,
but I invited some

15:54.056 --> 15:55.816
of my girls from work.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.059
- What?

15:57.887 --> 15:59.372
I wish you would've told me.

15:59.510 --> 16:00.683
I don't even think
there's room at the villa.

16:00.821 --> 16:02.306
- No, no, no, I called the villa

16:02.444 --> 16:04.032
and I booked all their
rooms, it's good, we're good.

16:04.170 --> 16:05.930
- [Mel] Well, sure, I guess.

16:06.068 --> 16:07.069
The more the merrier.
- Yep.

16:07.207 --> 16:08.553
- I mean, if this is gonna be

16:08.691 --> 16:10.107
a real bachelorette
party, why not have all

16:10.245 --> 16:11.384
of the people that
are important to me.

16:11.522 --> 16:14.111
- How you doing.
- Hey, girl.

16:14.249 --> 16:16.423
- Hey. Hey, Lilian.

16:16.561 --> 16:19.150
- Thanks for coming.
- Girl, oh, my God.

16:19.288 --> 16:20.565
- [Sophia] Y'all,
this is Melody.

16:20.703 --> 16:23.430
[upbeat music]

16:43.795 --> 16:45.659
- Wow, you like it?

16:45.797 --> 16:47.213
- So beautiful.

16:48.076 --> 16:50.457
- Yeah, I knew you'd like it.

16:51.320 --> 16:53.046
- You really do know me, huh?

16:53.184 --> 16:55.221
- You're my day one.

16:55.359 --> 16:57.740
- Feels like so long ago.

16:57.878 --> 16:58.948
- Not to me.

16:59.087 --> 17:01.296
- Uh-huh, I'm sure.

17:01.434 --> 17:02.262
Wow.

17:02.400 --> 17:03.401
- Come on girls, hurry up.

17:03.539 --> 17:06.473
- Oh, come on, come on, come on.

17:07.715 --> 17:09.131
- Perfect.

17:09.269 --> 17:10.960
So, Sophia's bachelorette.
- Let's do it.

17:11.098 --> 17:14.102
- [Rose] Let's go
get some shots.

17:14.861 --> 17:17.208
- [Sophia] Let's do it.

17:17.346 --> 17:19.624
- [Lilian] This is great.

17:19.762 --> 17:22.489
[gentle music]

17:25.974 --> 17:27.563
- I just wanted to take a minute

17:27.701 --> 17:29.565
to show you ladies around
our presidential suite.

17:29.703 --> 17:31.498
It sleeps up to five
guests comfortably

17:31.636 --> 17:34.329
and features world
class amenities.

17:34.467 --> 17:36.262
And the three additional
rooms you reserved are back

17:36.400 --> 17:38.195
at the main property.

17:38.333 --> 17:39.334
[Sophia laughs]

17:39.472 --> 17:42.475
- You really went all out, Mel.

17:42.613 --> 17:44.063
- Well, I mean,
it's not every day

17:44.201 --> 17:45.512
your best friend
gets married, right?

17:45.650 --> 17:49.447
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, thank you.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.968
- And thank you for all of this

17:53.106 --> 17:55.281
and I'm sorry I haven't
been doing so great

17:55.419 --> 17:57.352
at keeping in touch.

17:57.490 --> 18:00.389
- It's all right,
life happens, right?

18:00.527 --> 18:02.909
- Well, I'll leave
you ladies to it.

18:03.047 --> 18:04.600
Enjoy your stay.

18:04.738 --> 18:06.015
If you need anything at all,
just call the main desk.

18:06.154 --> 18:07.431
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

18:07.569 --> 18:08.777
- [Host] You're welcome.

18:08.915 --> 18:10.054
- [Sophia] Wow.

18:10.192 --> 18:11.745
- Yeah, take it all in.
- Yeah.

18:11.883 --> 18:13.885
- Check this out,
look at this bed.

18:14.023 --> 18:15.370
- [Sophia] Mm.

18:15.508 --> 18:18.235
- Go ahead, feel it, go ahead.

18:18.373 --> 18:19.201
- All right.
- I bet it's soft.

18:19.339 --> 18:20.444
- Okay.

18:26.070 --> 18:27.761
Ooh.
- Uh-huh.

18:27.899 --> 18:30.626
[Sophia laughs]

18:30.764 --> 18:31.938
- So, what's up with
you, what's new?

18:32.076 --> 18:34.113
Are you still in nursing school?

18:34.251 --> 18:35.114
- Girl, I finished
nursing school

18:35.252 --> 18:36.736
before the pandemic.

18:36.874 --> 18:38.047
You know I've been
traveling around

18:38.186 --> 18:39.532
the country with the hospitals.

18:39.670 --> 18:40.878
Yeah, I didn't think it
was gonna pay this much,

18:41.016 --> 18:42.604
but it's given me so much time

18:42.742 --> 18:47.540
that now my big hustle is
making CBD oils for massage.

18:52.441 --> 18:53.960
- Okay.
- Uh-huh.

18:54.892 --> 18:57.239
- Wait, you graduated.
- Yeah.

18:57.377 --> 18:59.828
- Congratulations.
I'm sorry, Mel.

18:59.966 --> 19:02.210
- Don't worry about
it, life happens right.

19:02.348 --> 19:03.556
- [Sophia] Yeah.

19:03.694 --> 19:04.902
- Besides, you
clearly been booed up.

19:05.040 --> 19:06.973
- Yeah, but, you know.

19:08.077 --> 19:10.770
I don't mean to miss
out on things with you.

19:10.908 --> 19:12.427
- It's all good.

19:14.014 --> 19:16.948
What happens in three years?

19:17.086 --> 19:18.916
- Dang, it's been that long?

19:19.054 --> 19:20.159
- Mm-hmm.

19:20.849 --> 19:21.746
- Mm.

19:22.609 --> 19:25.233
- Can I, can I say something?

19:25.371 --> 19:26.682
- Yeah, sure.

19:28.063 --> 19:31.273
- I just, I didn't
think you'd end up

19:31.411 --> 19:33.689
with somebody like Kevin.

19:36.244 --> 19:37.624
- Really? Why?

19:38.694 --> 19:40.420
- Sophie, he's boring.

19:40.558 --> 19:43.285
He's everything you always
said you never wanted.

19:43.423 --> 19:45.805
- Okay, Mel, but things change.

19:45.943 --> 19:48.877
He's sweet, he's thoughtful
and he's a great guy.

19:49.015 --> 19:52.432
- And you're spontaneous,
you're adventurous.

19:52.570 --> 19:55.090
I just wanna make sure
you're not settling.

19:55.228 --> 19:56.540
- Settling?

19:56.678 --> 20:00.337
Listen, I love Kevin
and I'm marrying him,

20:00.475 --> 20:04.858
not because I have to,
but because I want to.

20:04.996 --> 20:06.412
- Okay.

20:06.550 --> 20:07.551
But does he know about us?

20:07.689 --> 20:10.209
- What? No, there's no us.

20:11.417 --> 20:12.728
- If he doesn't know about us,

20:12.866 --> 20:15.386
then he doesn't
know the real you.

20:15.524 --> 20:17.388
- Yes, he does.

20:17.526 --> 20:20.840
Like what we do,
it's fun, that's it.

20:22.462 --> 20:23.567
- Okay.

20:26.811 --> 20:28.019
If you say so.
- Mm-hmm.

20:28.157 --> 20:29.331
- Mm.
- Yep.

20:32.334 --> 20:34.198
- Yep, smells good, don't it?

20:34.336 --> 20:36.165
- Okay, so massage oils, huh.

20:36.304 --> 20:37.753
- [Mel] Uh-huh.

20:38.892 --> 20:41.067
- And you know how to use them?

20:41.205 --> 20:42.448
- I made it.

20:43.345 --> 20:44.450
- Word.

20:46.037 --> 20:47.038
Let me see.

20:48.385 --> 20:49.524
- [Mel] Oh, you wanna try it.

20:49.662 --> 20:50.663
- I do, let me see.
- Okay.

20:50.801 --> 20:51.802
- Let me see what you got.

20:51.940 --> 20:52.975
- Oh, you wanna see what I got.

20:53.113 --> 20:53.976
- [Sophia] Uh-huh.

20:54.114 --> 20:55.219
- You know what I got.

20:55.357 --> 20:56.807
- Yep.
- Mm-hmm.

21:02.191 --> 21:04.987
[sensual music]

21:11.684 --> 21:14.445
- Everyone's all
checked in their rooms

21:14.583 --> 21:15.653
and the plan is
for us to all meet

21:15.791 --> 21:18.346
for brunch in the morning.

21:20.002 --> 21:21.141
- Okay, cool.

21:21.970 --> 21:24.559
So, you ready for your massage.

21:24.697 --> 21:26.595
- You have no idea.

21:28.977 --> 21:31.773
[sensual music]

21:50.516 --> 21:51.551
- You know it's been a long time

21:51.689 --> 21:54.313
since you felt these hands.

21:55.383 --> 21:56.763
- So sensual.

21:59.041 --> 21:59.904
- Yeah.

22:00.042 --> 22:02.838
[sensual music]

22:27.035 --> 22:29.831
[Sophia laughs]

22:33.490 --> 22:35.871
- Wow, this feels so good.

22:42.326 --> 22:44.570
[Sophia moans]

22:44.708 --> 22:47.952
- I've been told I
have magic hands.

22:49.091 --> 22:51.818
[Sophia moans]

22:57.790 --> 23:00.758
- Who told you that?
- Somebody.

23:02.588 --> 23:03.761
- Mm, okay.

23:07.869 --> 23:11.044
So, um, where you
sleeping tonight?

23:13.184 --> 23:16.291
- I thought I was
over here with you.

23:16.429 --> 23:18.880
- I need a little bit of space.

23:19.018 --> 23:22.435
But, thank you for
the massage, Mel.

23:24.333 --> 23:25.438
- What?

23:27.233 --> 23:28.165
- Mm-mm.

23:30.098 --> 23:31.893
No, it's time to go.

23:35.103 --> 23:37.139
Go ahead, Mel.
- Really?

23:37.277 --> 23:38.209
- Go!

23:45.769 --> 23:48.634
[gentle music]

24:01.543 --> 24:04.201
[phone rings]

24:13.866 --> 24:15.246
Hey, babe.
- Hey, baby.

24:15.384 --> 24:16.489
- I miss you.

24:16.627 --> 24:18.560
- I miss you, too, baby.

24:18.698 --> 24:19.941
- [Sophia] You
got a few minutes?

24:20.079 --> 24:21.218
- Of course.

24:21.356 --> 24:24.083
[gentle music]

24:33.679 --> 24:35.474
- [Mel] Morning.

24:35.612 --> 24:37.614
- [Sophia] Good morning.

24:37.752 --> 24:39.305
- Well, I got keys
to everybody's room

24:39.443 --> 24:40.927
because I know there's
gonna be a lot of drinking

24:41.065 --> 24:42.481
and I didn't want
to have to worry

24:42.619 --> 24:44.724
about anything on your big day.

24:44.862 --> 24:46.761
- You're so smart.

24:46.899 --> 24:49.902
You always take such
good care of me.

24:50.040 --> 24:51.938
- I know.
- Mm-hmm.

24:52.939 --> 24:54.907
- You're up early.
- Yeah.

24:55.045 --> 24:58.324
- Don't wanna be
late for brunch.

24:58.462 --> 25:02.501
- So, you, um, you think we
should talk about last night?

25:02.639 --> 25:04.226
- Oh, about what?

25:05.573 --> 25:09.300
- [laughs] About the
moment between you and me.

25:09.438 --> 25:11.302
- Right, the massage.

25:12.441 --> 25:13.684
It was nice.

25:16.756 --> 25:19.069
Look, I'm marrying Kevin.

25:20.208 --> 25:22.624
- [scoffs] Okay, so,
you can have a massage

25:22.762 --> 25:26.076
from me, get turned
on and that's it.

25:27.698 --> 25:29.700
- Of course that's it.

25:29.838 --> 25:31.944
We just can't anymore.

25:33.497 --> 25:35.534
- You don't love him.

25:36.638 --> 25:38.226
I know you don't.

25:39.848 --> 25:41.091
- Yes, I do.

25:44.128 --> 25:46.924
- Well, he was the last person
on your mind last night.

25:47.062 --> 25:50.687
- Well, I called him
as soon as I left.

25:52.171 --> 25:55.795
- You mean, after I
gave you a massage.

25:56.796 --> 25:57.901
- Mm-hmm.

25:59.074 --> 26:02.906
See, your hands, they
did something for me,

26:04.286 --> 26:07.980
so I went to go call him
so we could have video sex.

26:08.118 --> 26:10.258
It was great, Mel [laughs].

26:10.396 --> 26:14.573
Felt like we were
young again [laughs].

26:14.711 --> 26:17.679
- Well, at least
one of us got off.

26:17.817 --> 26:23.098
- You were always so good about
introduce me to new stuff.

26:28.587 --> 26:30.554
- We're connected.

26:30.692 --> 26:33.246
We are always
gonna be connected.

26:33.384 --> 26:36.008
- And we'll always
be best friends.

26:36.146 --> 26:38.700
That's never gonna change.

26:40.150 --> 26:44.844
Come on, Mel, let's go to
brunch, come on, let's go.

26:45.949 --> 26:47.744
[Sophia laughs]

26:47.882 --> 26:49.193
Come on, Mel.

26:51.540 --> 26:52.265
[all laughing]

26:52.403 --> 26:53.784
- Oh, my gosh.

26:54.889 --> 26:56.856
- So, what's the
agenda for the day?

26:56.994 --> 26:58.824
- Well, we have a
hike after lunch

26:58.962 --> 27:00.411
and then a spa day.
- Ooh.

27:00.549 --> 27:04.864
- Then, tonight, we're
going to a strip club.

27:05.002 --> 27:07.315
- A strip club?
- My idea.

27:08.661 --> 27:11.008
- [Lillian] I don't think
anyone is surprised about that.

27:11.146 --> 27:12.907
- That's true, but,
y'all, I don't know

27:13.045 --> 27:15.495
about going to a strip club.

27:15.634 --> 27:17.256
It's not really my thing.

27:17.394 --> 27:19.776
- Girl, it's your
bachelorette party.

27:19.914 --> 27:21.467
A strip club is essential.

27:21.605 --> 27:23.469
- Yeah, I don't know.

27:24.608 --> 27:25.782
- Oh, come on, what do
you think Kevin's doing

27:25.920 --> 27:27.404
at his bachelor party, hmm?

27:27.542 --> 27:29.199
Drinking tea, playing golf?

27:29.337 --> 27:33.306
No, he's being grinded
on by a flock of women.

27:33.444 --> 27:34.929
- Yep.

27:35.067 --> 27:37.276
- Okay, yeah, but Kevin's
not like that, so.

27:37.414 --> 27:39.416
- He's a man, isn't it?

27:40.348 --> 27:41.867
He's got a dick?

27:43.006 --> 27:44.145
Then he's exactly like that.
- Mm-hmm.

27:44.283 --> 27:48.459
- I doubt it, but okay [laughs].

27:48.597 --> 27:50.116
- You know, I gotta say,

27:50.254 --> 27:52.360
I'm just so surprised
that she ended up

27:52.498 --> 27:54.362
with someone like Kevin.

27:54.500 --> 27:55.812
- Hmm, what do you mean?

27:55.950 --> 27:58.642
- I mean, he's not
her usual type.

27:58.780 --> 28:00.057
- What is her type then?

28:00.195 --> 28:01.680
- Well, in high
school and college,

28:01.818 --> 28:03.716
she liked the bad
guys, you know.

28:03.854 --> 28:07.306
The kind that went for
freedom instead of stability.

28:07.444 --> 28:08.445
- Hmm.
- Mm.

28:09.757 --> 28:10.619
- So, you like 'em dangerous

28:10.758 --> 28:12.725
and full of red flags.

28:13.864 --> 28:16.211
It's okay, I can relate.

28:16.349 --> 28:17.281
- Yeah.

28:18.420 --> 28:21.320
- In high school,
her boyfriend, Sam,

28:21.458 --> 28:23.115
he was her first love

28:23.253 --> 28:26.118
and that boy was a handful.

28:26.256 --> 28:27.084
- Hmm.

28:27.222 --> 28:28.396
- Captain of the football team

28:28.534 --> 28:30.329
and his dad was a rancher.

28:31.433 --> 28:33.090
All he ever wanted
was to play in the NFL

28:33.228 --> 28:35.817
and buy a ranch of his own.

28:36.680 --> 28:39.131
- Did he ever play in the NFL?

28:42.479 --> 28:44.412
- He died senior year.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.968
- What? Oh, my God, how?

28:51.626 --> 28:54.077
- He was in a car accident.

28:57.114 --> 28:58.219
- He took a corner too fast

28:58.357 --> 28:59.634
and the whole car just blew up.

28:59.772 --> 29:02.292
- Oh, my God.
- It was awful.

29:04.156 --> 29:06.054
- That is terrible.

29:09.713 --> 29:10.783
I'm sorry.

29:12.164 --> 29:16.513
- Um, it was a long time
ago and I've changed.

29:16.651 --> 29:17.652
You know, Kevin is perfect

29:17.790 --> 29:20.034
for where my life is headed.

29:20.172 --> 29:23.278
Structured,
consistent, organized.

29:25.764 --> 29:28.421
Exactly what I want for my life.

29:28.559 --> 29:30.699
- And he's hot.
- Yeah, he's cute.

29:30.838 --> 29:31.700
- Too much.

29:31.839 --> 29:33.185
- He is, he's sweet.

29:33.323 --> 29:35.843
- So, how did you
two meet anyways?

29:36.878 --> 29:38.604
- Well, funny enough,
when I started

29:38.742 --> 29:40.019
the firm about 3-1/2 years ago,

29:40.157 --> 29:42.056
Kevin actually worked
for the law office

29:42.194 --> 29:44.230
that was helping us with
all of our paperwork.

29:44.368 --> 29:47.233
- Okay, so, who courted who?

29:47.371 --> 29:50.961
- He did, every day
for about a month.

29:51.099 --> 29:52.031
I finally let him take me out

29:52.169 --> 29:53.481
on like a little date.

29:53.619 --> 29:58.003
- That's so sweet.
- That's cute [laughs].

29:58.141 --> 30:00.384
- So sweet.
- He's great.

30:02.283 --> 30:04.043
- Ladies, do you
need anything else?

30:04.181 --> 30:05.424
- [Together] Shots.

30:05.562 --> 30:07.046
- A whole round,
we're ready for that.

31:20.706 --> 31:23.709
- Oh, that's right,
you said that.

31:23.847 --> 31:26.574
- Sophie's never mentioned me?

31:26.712 --> 31:27.575
- I'm sure she has.

31:27.713 --> 31:29.888
I just probably forgot.

31:32.062 --> 31:33.132
- So, what is it that you do?

31:33.270 --> 31:34.133
You work at the firm, right?

31:34.271 --> 31:35.894
- I'm the CFO.

31:36.032 --> 31:39.138
- Oh, well, that's impressive.

31:39.276 --> 31:40.588
- It's boring, really.

31:40.726 --> 31:43.556

31:43.694 --> 31:45.558

- So, what's the
deal with these two?

31:50.701 --> 31:53.290

accounts manager.

31:53.428 --> 31:55.637

bringing in new business

31:55.775 --> 31:56.776

of our social media.

32:01.816 --> 32:04.750
She does all of the socials.

32:04.888 --> 32:06.269
- Makes sense.

32:11.619 --> 32:13.759
- [Rose] So, are there
any male strippers coming?

32:13.897 --> 32:15.140

bachelorette party just

47:27.810 --> 47:29.916
to kill some random dancer?

47:30.054 --> 47:31.641
Who does that?

47:31.779 --> 47:34.644
- I know, I'm probably
overthinking things.

47:34.782 --> 47:36.060
- Just a little.

47:36.198 --> 47:39.442
[suspenseful music]

47:46.484 --> 47:48.072
- [Sophia] Did you
get Rose's card?

47:48.210 --> 47:50.764
- Yeah, we did, that's
what I came to tell you.

47:50.902 --> 47:52.076
You dropped the key cards

47:52.214 --> 47:55.044
in the strip club parking lot.

47:56.528 --> 47:58.220
- Are you okay?

47:58.358 --> 48:00.981
- Yeah, it's probably nothing.

48:01.119 --> 48:02.500
- Don't do that.

48:02.638 --> 48:04.398
Tell me what's going on?

48:04.536 --> 48:06.021
- Where's Melody?

48:06.159 --> 48:09.403
- She's upstairs
in the shower, why?

48:10.542 --> 48:11.578
- When we were at
the strip club,

48:11.716 --> 48:13.442
we spoke to the manager.

48:13.580 --> 48:14.512
- Okay?

48:15.893 --> 48:18.274
- The dancer that came
back here last night seems

48:18.412 --> 48:20.656
to be missing.
- Missing?

48:24.280 --> 48:27.214
- The manager caught
her on camera leaving

48:27.352 --> 48:30.114
the club with you and Melody.

48:31.839 --> 48:34.566
- I don't even remember
coming back here.

48:34.704 --> 48:40.124
- Did Melody mention a dancer
named Foxxy staying over?

48:41.263 --> 48:43.506
- [Sophia] Honestly,
I can't remember.

48:46.095 --> 48:47.925
- What's going on?

48:49.374 --> 48:52.757
- Did we leave last night
with a dancer named Foxxy?

48:52.895 --> 48:57.520
- I don't know, we left
with a lot of dancers, why?

48:59.488 --> 49:01.731
- The manager pulled Rose
and Lilian inside his office.

49:01.869 --> 49:04.148
He has security footage
of a dancer leaving

49:04.286 --> 49:07.599
with us last night and
he said she's missing.

49:07.737 --> 49:10.878
- It's been like a day, she's
probably sleeping it off.

49:11.017 --> 49:12.708
- [Sophia] Right.

49:12.846 --> 49:13.847
- I don't know.

49:13.985 --> 49:14.952
I got the sense that this is out

49:15.090 --> 49:16.298
of the ordinary for her.

49:16.436 --> 49:18.645
They seemed concerned.

49:18.783 --> 49:20.405
- [Melody] She's a stripper.

49:20.543 --> 49:24.168
I doubt this is the first
time she's going missing.

49:24.306 --> 49:26.066
- I guess.
- Yeah.

49:29.138 --> 49:31.244
- What's the deal with her?

49:31.382 --> 49:32.624
- She's just a
little rough around

49:32.762 --> 49:34.109
the edges sometimes.

49:34.247 --> 49:36.076
We had a tough life.

49:36.214 --> 49:37.215
- How so?

49:37.353 --> 49:40.149
- Her dad, just not a good man.

49:41.357 --> 49:43.221
We'll leave it at that, okay?

49:43.359 --> 49:44.878
- That's awful.

49:45.016 --> 49:47.087
- Yeah, and she's
been there with me

49:47.225 --> 49:50.125
through every major life event.

49:51.264 --> 49:52.990
- [Lilian] I know you
too are close, but just-

49:53.128 --> 49:54.370
- Just what?

49:55.509 --> 49:57.442
- When I said the
girl is missing,

49:57.580 --> 50:00.169
she had no concern, nothing.

50:00.307 --> 50:01.895
- Okay, why would she?

50:02.033 --> 50:04.001
- [Lilian] Because she's a
human being, that's what we do.

50:04.139 --> 50:06.486
- Okay, but do you have concern
when you watch the news?

50:06.624 --> 50:07.935
- I know you two
are best friends,

50:08.074 --> 50:09.420
that's what's blinding you.

50:09.558 --> 50:12.112
There's something up
with her, I can feel it.

50:12.250 --> 50:13.389
- You don't know her

50:13.527 --> 50:14.977
and you don't even know me.

50:15.115 --> 50:17.359
- Just be careful around
her, Sophie, please.

50:17.497 --> 50:19.326
- Look, I told you I'm
done with the conversation.

50:19.464 --> 50:22.364
And maybe I need to
be careful around you.

50:22.502 --> 50:24.400
Time for you to go.

50:28.404 --> 50:31.649
[suspenseful music]

50:39.622 --> 50:43.212
- So you really think
Melody is dangerous?

50:43.350 --> 50:44.593
- [Lilian] I don't know.

50:44.731 --> 50:47.837
I just know
something's not right.

50:49.356 --> 50:52.497
- All right, well,
look, we're only here

50:52.635 --> 50:55.983
a little while longer,
let's just stick it out.

50:56.122 --> 50:59.815
When we leave here, we'll
never have to see her again.

50:59.953 --> 51:01.058
- I guess.

51:02.783 --> 51:04.854
- You going to the pool
this late at night?

51:04.992 --> 51:06.787
- Yeah, the water calms me.

51:06.925 --> 51:10.446
By product of growing
up on the coast.

51:10.584 --> 51:11.758
- You need me to go with you?

51:11.896 --> 51:14.692
- Nah, you can come if you want.

51:15.934 --> 51:18.316
I won't be much company.

51:18.454 --> 51:21.699
I just really need
to clear my head.

51:22.838 --> 51:26.083
- Okay, so I'll just
call it a night then.

51:26.221 --> 51:27.187
See you at breakfast?

51:27.325 --> 51:28.637
- Absolutely.

51:37.887 --> 51:43.307
[water splashes]
[suspenseful music]

52:01.290 --> 52:02.567
Fuck, Melody.

52:02.705 --> 52:05.812
- So, you don't trust me, huh?

52:05.950 --> 52:08.332
- That's not what it is.

52:08.470 --> 52:10.920
It's the way you
are with Sophie.

52:11.058 --> 52:12.991
Something's not right.

52:14.165 --> 52:17.375
I know you had something
to do with that dancer.

52:17.513 --> 52:19.136
I could feel it

52:19.964 --> 52:22.415
and I'm gonna figure it out.

52:24.900 --> 52:27.213
[Lilian screams]

52:27.351 --> 52:30.077
[suspenseful music]

52:30.216 --> 52:31.941
[Lilian gasps]

52:32.079 --> 52:35.324
[suspenseful music]

53:10.428 --> 53:11.705
- I'm excited about dinner.

53:11.843 --> 53:13.328
I hope that have that
meatloaf they had-

53:13.466 --> 53:14.467
- Like you.
- Thank you.

53:14.605 --> 53:15.951
- Ladies, ladies, I'm so sorry.

53:16.089 --> 53:18.505
I'm afraid that the
restaurant, the pool

53:18.643 --> 53:21.059
and the workout
facilities are all closed.

53:21.198 --> 53:22.475
- Why?
- Why?

53:22.613 --> 53:24.442
- It was due to an
unfortunate accident.

53:24.580 --> 53:27.307
- Accident, what
kind of accident?

53:27.445 --> 53:29.620
- We had an accidental
death in the pool.

53:29.758 --> 53:32.105
Our techs are just
cleaning up the area.

53:32.243 --> 53:33.244
- God.

53:33.382 --> 53:34.383
- Sorry for the inconvenience.

53:34.521 --> 53:36.316
- Oh, my God, a drowning?

53:36.454 --> 53:39.146
- Has anybody heard from Lilian?

53:39.285 --> 53:43.461
- [Rose] Last night, she said
she was going to the, oh, no.

53:43.599 --> 53:44.876
- No, no, no, could we-
- Ladies.

53:45.014 --> 53:46.395
- Ladies, please
wait, wait, please.

53:46.533 --> 53:48.984
We'd like you to step back.

53:50.157 --> 53:51.573
- What are you talking about?

53:51.711 --> 53:52.919
What are you talking about?

53:53.057 --> 53:54.852
[friends scream]

53:54.990 --> 53:58.027
- Ladies, ladies,
ladies, ladies.

54:02.722 --> 54:04.965
- [Mel] Okay, I got you.

54:06.104 --> 54:09.142
- I just, I can't
believe she's gone.

54:09.280 --> 54:11.938
- [Melody] I know, it's crazy.

54:12.870 --> 54:14.389
She was so nice.

54:15.355 --> 54:16.805
- You did this.

54:16.943 --> 54:19.359
- [Kylie] Rose, what
are you talking about?

54:19.497 --> 54:21.154
- Yeah, what are
you talking about?

54:21.292 --> 54:24.122
- [Sophia] Rose, you're
being emotional right now.

54:24.261 --> 54:25.779
- Lilian didn't trust her

54:25.917 --> 54:28.057
and then the next
day she ends up dead.

54:28.195 --> 54:29.404
- They said it was an accident.

54:29.542 --> 54:30.853
- Bullshit.

54:30.991 --> 54:32.924
- She slipped and
drowned in the pool,

54:33.062 --> 54:34.650
that's what the
investigator said.

54:34.788 --> 54:36.549
- You really believe that?

54:36.687 --> 54:37.964
- I mean, what else
is there to believe?

54:38.102 --> 54:40.242
- That she did
this. She's crazy.

54:40.380 --> 54:41.692
[Mel laughs]

54:41.830 --> 54:43.280
That's probably why they
can't find the dancer.

54:43.418 --> 54:44.488
Psycho bitch.

54:44.626 --> 54:47.767
- Bitch? I'll show you a bitch.

54:47.905 --> 54:50.528
- What? You gonna kill me, too?

54:50.666 --> 54:53.013
- All right, y'all, y'all,
come on, calm, calm down.

54:53.151 --> 54:56.741
We gotta be together
in this, okay?

54:56.879 --> 54:59.848
- I can't fuckin' believe y'all.

55:02.160 --> 55:04.404
- I'll go talk with her.

55:09.444 --> 55:11.963
- What was that about?

55:12.101 --> 55:13.482
- I don't know.

55:13.620 --> 55:16.347
She better figure it out.

55:16.485 --> 55:19.937
- She's just
frazzled, we all are.

55:20.075 --> 55:21.387
- Yeah.

55:21.525 --> 55:22.940
- We haven't had time
to process anything.

55:23.078 --> 55:25.011
- Yeah, you're right.

55:25.149 --> 55:26.978
So, what should we do?

55:27.116 --> 55:28.739
- Well, the police
asked for us to stay

55:28.877 --> 55:31.017
a few more days
until they finish

55:31.155 --> 55:32.812
the full autopsy in case

55:32.950 --> 55:34.986
there were any more questions.

55:35.124 --> 55:36.471
- Questions?

55:36.609 --> 55:39.370
They said it was an accident.

55:40.682 --> 55:42.649
- They did, but Rose
has been really adamant

55:42.787 --> 55:45.583
about something else
terrible happening,

55:45.721 --> 55:48.690
so they just wanna double check.

55:52.452 --> 55:55.075
- Mel, where are you going?

55:55.213 --> 55:57.871
- It's, you know,
it's been a lot today.

55:58.009 --> 56:01.530
Your friend attacked
me and people dying.

56:01.668 --> 56:05.914
I just, I'm gonna take a
walk and clear my head.

56:08.123 --> 56:11.885
- Mel, just take your
phone just in case.

56:15.268 --> 56:17.063
- Thanks.
- I get it.

56:26.244 --> 56:28.833
[Rose cries]

56:39.775 --> 56:42.675
[phone buzzes]

57:05.525 --> 57:07.734
- [Guard] Security.

57:07.872 --> 57:08.942
Hello?

57:09.080 --> 57:11.773
- I'd like to
report an incident.

57:11.911 --> 57:14.154
I have information about
what happened at the pool.

57:14.292 --> 57:15.708
- [Guard] Ma'am, we're
aware of the incident,

57:15.846 --> 57:16.847
please stop calling.

57:16.985 --> 57:18.745
- No, no, no, no, I got a text.

57:18.883 --> 57:22.128
I got a text and I
have information.

57:25.580 --> 57:26.684
Hello?

57:27.374 --> 57:30.619
[suspenseful music]

57:34.727 --> 57:36.763
I'll go do it myself.

57:41.458 --> 57:44.322
- It's looking like a dead end.

57:44.461 --> 57:46.255
I'm gonna keep looking
for about another hour,

57:46.393 --> 57:50.087
but I don't know,
it's not looking good.

57:54.194 --> 57:55.610
Okay.

57:55.748 --> 57:58.992
[suspenseful music]

58:14.145 --> 58:15.077
Foxxy?

58:16.527 --> 58:18.184
Is that you?

58:18.322 --> 58:21.567
[suspenseful music]

58:33.510 --> 58:34.372
- You wanna tell me what that

58:34.511 --> 58:36.409
was all about earlier?

58:36.547 --> 58:38.894
- You know what it was about.

58:39.032 --> 58:41.448
- Why would you think
Melody is some sort of-

58:41.587 --> 58:43.830
- Psycho? Because she is.

58:43.968 --> 58:45.867
- She's not, she-
- She killed Lilian.

58:46.005 --> 58:48.179
- That's not possible, Rose.

58:48.317 --> 58:49.422
- How do you know?

58:49.560 --> 58:52.563
- I just know and why would she?

58:52.701 --> 58:55.393
- That's not good
enough, Sophia.

58:55.532 --> 58:58.258
- Okay, well, I don't know
what you want from me.

58:58.396 --> 59:00.019
- I want you to listen.

59:00.157 --> 59:01.089
- Talk.

59:03.091 --> 59:05.265
- I've seen the way
she looks at you.

59:05.403 --> 59:08.096
There's something
you're not telling me.

59:08.234 --> 59:09.684
- It's nothing.

59:11.651 --> 59:13.273
Okay.

59:13.411 --> 59:17.243
Look, Melody and I hooked
up a few times growing up

59:17.381 --> 59:18.762
and that's it.

59:22.179 --> 59:24.699
- So, do you think
she's in love with you?

59:24.837 --> 59:26.632
- What? No, of course not.

59:26.770 --> 59:28.047
- Think about it.

59:28.185 --> 59:29.427
It makes sense.

59:29.566 --> 59:30.877
If she's in love with you,

59:31.015 --> 59:32.223
she would try to
take out anybody

59:32.361 --> 59:33.811
that gets in the way.

59:33.949 --> 59:35.641
- That's ridiculous Rose.

59:35.779 --> 59:37.090
- Is it, though?

59:37.228 --> 59:38.471
- Yeah, I mean, I've
known her pretty much

59:38.609 --> 59:39.886
my whole life.

59:40.024 --> 59:41.336
She's been there
for every boyfriend,

59:41.474 --> 59:43.510
every heartbreak, every problem.

59:43.649 --> 59:44.684
She's always been there

59:44.822 --> 59:46.721
and she's never hurt anybody.

59:46.859 --> 59:48.170
- That you know of.

59:48.308 --> 59:49.931
- I know her heart.

59:50.069 --> 59:51.898
- You also know Lilian.

59:52.036 --> 59:54.591
She was the most responsible
out of all of us.

59:54.729 --> 59:56.040
There's no way she would just go

59:56.178 --> 59:58.733
to the pool drunk
enough to pass out.

59:58.871 --> 01:00:00.389
You know that.

01:00:00.527 --> 01:00:03.392
- Okay, yeah, it was
kind of out of character.

01:00:03.530 --> 01:00:04.842
- Exactly.

01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:06.879
- Yeah, but that doesn't
mean I agree with you.

01:00:07.017 --> 01:00:09.951
- Listen, Lilian was telling me

01:00:10.089 --> 01:00:11.711
that she did not trust Melody.

01:00:11.849 --> 01:00:13.817
She didn't like her,
think about that.

01:00:13.955 --> 01:00:17.337
- Listen, Rose, are
you gonna be okay?

01:00:18.649 --> 01:00:20.340
- I really, really need you

01:00:20.478 --> 01:00:23.792
to think about what I'm
saying and be careful.

01:00:23.930 --> 01:00:27.175
[suspenseful music]

01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:40.533
- Hey.

01:00:40.671 --> 01:00:42.259
- Hey.

01:00:42.397 --> 01:00:44.019
How was your walk?

01:00:44.157 --> 01:00:46.643
- It was good, necessary.

01:00:48.403 --> 01:00:49.991
- Where'd you go?

01:00:51.095 --> 01:00:52.925
- The trails. Why?

01:00:54.961 --> 01:00:57.930
- No reason, I was just curious.

01:01:01.692 --> 01:01:03.625
- Okay, clearly there's
something on your mind,

01:01:03.763 --> 01:01:05.213
so just say it.

01:01:08.975 --> 01:01:11.357
- Are you in love with me?

01:01:12.254 --> 01:01:15.119
- [laughs] What?

01:01:15.948 --> 01:01:17.777
What are you talking about?

01:01:17.915 --> 01:01:19.227
- Rose has this crazy idea

01:01:19.365 --> 01:01:23.127
that you're in love
with me or something.

01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:26.406
- Why would that be so crazy?

01:01:26.544 --> 01:01:28.029
- Because we're best friends.

01:01:28.167 --> 01:01:31.584
And, I mean, I do love
you, but not like that.

01:01:31.722 --> 01:01:33.724
- Not like what?

01:01:33.862 --> 01:01:35.899
- Romantically. Yeah.

01:01:39.350 --> 01:01:40.179
- Of course. Okay.

01:01:40.317 --> 01:01:42.906
- 'Cause that would be crazy.

01:01:43.044 --> 01:01:45.011
- Yeah. Would.
- Yep.

01:01:49.188 --> 01:01:54.020
- But why is she asking you
if I'm in love with you?

01:01:54.158 --> 01:01:56.229
- Well, Rose has
this crazy notion

01:01:56.367 --> 01:01:58.197
that you're some
weird serial killer

01:01:58.335 --> 01:02:00.268
that's obsessed with me.
- What?

01:02:00.406 --> 01:02:02.649
- Yeah, she thinks that
you're out to kill anybody

01:02:02.788 --> 01:02:04.375
who gets between you and I

01:02:04.513 --> 01:02:07.068
and that's why she
thinks you killed Lilian.

01:02:07.206 --> 01:02:08.794
- So, she still thinks
I killed that girl.

01:02:08.932 --> 01:02:10.002
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:11.141
I told her it's impossible.

01:02:11.279 --> 01:02:12.936
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:02:13.074 --> 01:02:16.387
- But I do have
something to ask you.

01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:19.805
- What?

01:02:20.978 --> 01:02:23.912
- The night Lilian died,
you weren't in the room.

01:02:24.050 --> 01:02:25.776
I woke up and went
to the bathroom

01:02:25.914 --> 01:02:27.744
and you weren't there.

01:02:27.882 --> 01:02:29.331
Where were you?

01:02:30.091 --> 01:02:31.471
- I couldn't sleep.

01:02:31.609 --> 01:02:33.266
I went for a walk.

01:02:34.198 --> 01:02:36.304
- Did you hurt Lilian?

01:02:37.650 --> 01:02:39.031
- What?

01:02:39.169 --> 01:02:40.515
How could you even ask
me something like that?

01:02:40.653 --> 01:02:41.827
- I know-
- What is wrong with you?

01:02:41.965 --> 01:02:43.518
- I know it's stupid, I'm sorry.

01:02:43.656 --> 01:02:45.106
- Really, so you think I'm
just out here killing people.

01:02:45.244 --> 01:02:46.797
- No, no, of course
not, I'm sorry.

01:02:46.935 --> 01:02:48.626
- I cannot even
believe you would, why?

01:02:48.765 --> 01:02:50.490
- Rose is obsessed.

01:02:50.628 --> 01:02:54.322
She's been harassing
the villa security.

01:02:56.807 --> 01:02:58.740
I'm sorry, Mel.

01:02:58.878 --> 01:03:00.224
I know, I'm sorry.

01:03:00.362 --> 01:03:02.537
It's been a hell of
a day, so I'm just.

01:03:02.675 --> 01:03:04.366
- Yeah, tell me about it.

01:03:04.504 --> 01:03:06.713
- Get in the hot tub.

01:03:06.852 --> 01:03:10.096
[suspenseful music]

01:04:12.538 --> 01:04:13.470
- Melody?

01:04:16.473 --> 01:04:17.992
- Rose, I swear.

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:21.409
It's not what it looks like.

01:04:21.547 --> 01:04:22.617
- I knew it.

01:04:24.343 --> 01:04:26.310
And now I get proof.

01:04:31.074 --> 01:04:33.559
- You should've stayed
out of it, Rose.

01:04:33.697 --> 01:04:36.286
[Mel grunts]

01:04:38.115 --> 01:04:40.600
[rock bangs]

01:04:40.738 --> 01:04:43.983
[suspenseful music]

01:04:44.639 --> 01:04:47.228
[Mel grunts]

01:04:51.197 --> 01:04:52.302
Oh, bitch.

01:04:55.719 --> 01:04:58.308
[Rose cries]

01:05:08.145 --> 01:05:09.491
[bell rings]

01:05:09.629 --> 01:05:10.561
- Hello?

01:05:11.735 --> 01:05:12.736
Hello?

01:05:12.874 --> 01:05:16.119
[suspenseful music]

01:05:57.091 --> 01:05:58.333
- [Mel] Hey.

01:06:00.646 --> 01:06:01.958
- Hey.

01:06:02.096 --> 01:06:04.581
- I just wanted
to stay I'm sorry

01:06:06.790 --> 01:06:08.723
for the way I blew up.

01:06:10.104 --> 01:06:12.140
- God, what happened?

01:06:13.624 --> 01:06:14.556
- What?

01:06:16.110 --> 01:06:18.491
Oh, I was on my walk again

01:06:19.665 --> 01:06:21.425
and there was this
rock on the ground

01:06:21.563 --> 01:06:23.220
and then I tripped
over it and fell

01:06:23.358 --> 01:06:25.498
and hurt myself, so stupid.

01:06:25.636 --> 01:06:28.743
- You've always
been a big clumsy.

01:06:30.607 --> 01:06:31.711
- Thanks.

01:06:31.849 --> 01:06:32.989
- Remember in high school

01:06:33.127 --> 01:06:34.576
when Anna Saunders dared you

01:06:34.714 --> 01:06:36.544
to break into that
abandoned house in Van Nuys.

01:06:36.682 --> 01:06:37.959
- Oh, my God, of course,

01:06:38.097 --> 01:06:39.409
and I thought I was
some super agent

01:06:39.547 --> 01:06:41.100
and I tried to bust
through the window

01:06:41.238 --> 01:06:42.515
with my elbow.

01:06:42.653 --> 01:06:44.034
- Oh, man, you
had so many pieces

01:06:44.172 --> 01:06:45.415
of glass hanging
out of your arm,

01:06:45.553 --> 01:06:47.072
I never seen so much blood.

01:06:47.210 --> 01:06:48.452
- I had like 12 or 13 stitches.

01:06:48.590 --> 01:06:49.522
- Uh-huh.

01:06:51.455 --> 01:06:54.458
- We've really been
through a lot together.

01:06:54.596 --> 01:06:57.151
- Yeah, we certainly have.

01:06:59.118 --> 01:07:01.086
- Two peas in a pod.

01:07:03.122 --> 01:07:04.813
- I'm sorry about earlier.

01:07:04.951 --> 01:07:06.781
- Don't worry about it.

01:07:06.919 --> 01:07:11.096
- You always know how
to make me feel better.

01:07:16.066 --> 01:07:18.172
Hey, sleepyhead.
- Hey.

01:07:20.933 --> 01:07:22.486
- What are you doing up?

01:07:22.624 --> 01:07:26.835
- I'm gonna go check on
Rose real quick, that's all.

01:07:26.973 --> 01:07:28.078
- Why?

01:07:29.183 --> 01:07:31.219
- She was a little
raw last night

01:07:31.357 --> 01:07:33.394
and she's not responding
to any of my texts,

01:07:33.532 --> 01:07:35.499
so I'm a little worried.

01:07:35.637 --> 01:07:37.501
- She's probably ignoring you.

01:07:37.639 --> 01:07:41.436
- Maybe, but she also
hasn't been on socials today

01:07:41.574 --> 01:07:42.782
and you know that's her world,

01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:44.232
so that's a little weird.

01:07:44.370 --> 01:07:45.682
- Oh, my God, you
are not her mother.

01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:47.235
- Okay, but those
girls helped make me

01:07:47.373 --> 01:07:48.409
who I am, Mel.

01:07:48.547 --> 01:07:51.101
They helped build my firm.

01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:52.861
- Whatever.

01:07:54.035 --> 01:07:55.519
Can you please just
get back in the bed?

01:07:55.657 --> 01:07:58.246
- Look, I'm gonna
go check on Rose

01:07:58.384 --> 01:08:00.731
and when I come back
we can go to breakfast

01:08:00.869 --> 01:08:02.112
if you want.

01:08:03.251 --> 01:08:06.185
- I'm not hungry,
just do your thing.

01:08:16.816 --> 01:08:19.680
[birds chirping]

01:08:23.408 --> 01:08:25.825
- Rose, Rose, are you okay?

01:08:28.138 --> 01:08:29.243
Hello?

01:08:34.971 --> 01:08:35.973
Have you seen Rose?

01:08:36.112 --> 01:08:37.423
- No, not since last night.

01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:39.252
I mean, I was just
coming to check on her.

01:08:39.390 --> 01:08:40.529
- Yeah, she's not
taking any of my calls

01:08:40.667 --> 01:08:42.359
and I'm starting to get worried.

01:08:42.497 --> 01:08:44.706
- Well, I'm sure she's fine.

01:08:44.844 --> 01:08:46.950
I mean, obviously
she was really close

01:08:47.087 --> 01:08:49.194
with Lilian, so she
took her death hard.

01:08:49.332 --> 01:08:51.886
- Yeah, and the whole
blow up with Melody.

01:08:52.024 --> 01:08:54.026
- Yeah, that was something else.

01:08:54.163 --> 01:08:55.303
Where is Melody anyways?

01:08:55.441 --> 01:08:57.408
- She decided to sleep in

01:08:57.546 --> 01:08:58.893
and I wanna call Kevin,

01:08:59.031 --> 01:09:00.895
but I wouldn't even
know where to start.

01:09:01.033 --> 01:09:02.276
- Wanna go grab breakfast?

01:09:02.413 --> 01:09:03.587
- Um, sure.

01:09:14.702 --> 01:09:18.015
I can't help but be
worried about Rose.

01:09:18.154 --> 01:09:21.709
- Yeah, she was definitely
having a hard time.

01:09:21.846 --> 01:09:23.987
She didn't seem sad.

01:09:24.125 --> 01:09:27.093
She seemed angry and motivated.

01:09:27.232 --> 01:09:29.198
- Yeah, I saw her later

01:09:29.337 --> 01:09:30.613
and she had this crazy notion

01:09:30.752 --> 01:09:32.546
that Melody was
some sort of killer.

01:09:32.685 --> 01:09:35.205
- Yeah, she was
definitely adamant

01:09:35.343 --> 01:09:38.725
that Melody was
behind Lilian's death.

01:09:42.764 --> 01:09:46.665
- I just, I just wish
everybody would get along,

01:09:46.803 --> 01:09:49.011
especially considering
everything going on right now.

01:09:49.149 --> 01:09:51.979
- Could I ask you something?

01:09:52.118 --> 01:09:53.430
- Yeah, sure.

01:09:54.811 --> 01:09:57.814
- How come none of us
knew about Melody before?

01:09:57.952 --> 01:09:59.367
- What do you mean?

01:09:59.505 --> 01:10:02.232
- Come on Sophia, we've
all worked side by side

01:10:02.370 --> 01:10:03.647
for three years,

01:10:03.785 --> 01:10:06.823
but you never once
mentioned her.

01:10:09.239 --> 01:10:11.690
- Honestly, I don't know.

01:10:11.828 --> 01:10:15.901
I mean, I guess I just
had so much going on

01:10:16.039 --> 01:10:18.317
and even more in my
mind that time just kind

01:10:18.455 --> 01:10:20.112
of slipped away.

01:10:20.250 --> 01:10:22.873
- That makes sense, I guess.

01:10:23.011 --> 01:10:24.668
It's just strange.

01:10:26.981 --> 01:10:28.500
- Strange how?

01:10:28.638 --> 01:10:30.812
- For three years without
her, your life grew,

01:10:30.950 --> 01:10:34.195
business, friends,
relationships.

01:10:34.333 --> 01:10:36.680
Everything went perfect.

01:10:36.818 --> 01:10:41.237
She's back into the picture
and now all of this.

01:10:41.961 --> 01:10:42.962
- So, what?

01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:44.101
What you're saying she's evil

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:45.517
or some sort of bad omen?

01:10:45.655 --> 01:10:48.347
- No, that's not what
I'm saying at all.

01:10:48.485 --> 01:10:50.798
What I'm saying
is our souls know

01:10:50.936 --> 01:10:53.076
what kind of energy
we need in our lives

01:10:53.214 --> 01:10:54.284
and when our souls thrive

01:10:54.422 --> 01:10:55.665
in the absence of another,

01:10:55.803 --> 01:10:59.945
but dims in their
presence, that's a sign.

01:11:00.083 --> 01:11:01.602
- I wouldn't say that.

01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:03.742
I mean, she was really
important to me growing up.

01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:06.365
She still is really important.

01:11:06.503 --> 01:11:08.712
- Well, I can't speak for you.

01:11:08.850 --> 01:11:11.715
I can only tell you what I see.

01:11:14.304 --> 01:11:15.409
- Okay.

01:11:19.447 --> 01:11:22.243
- Still nothing from Rose?

01:11:22.381 --> 01:11:23.762
- No, nothing.

01:11:25.764 --> 01:11:27.731
- What should we do?

01:11:28.836 --> 01:11:31.079
- Don't you have an
extra set of room keys?

01:11:31.217 --> 01:11:35.429
- Oh, yeah, I found
their spare key cards.

01:11:35.567 --> 01:11:38.017
- Let's go check her room.

01:11:38.155 --> 01:11:41.400
[suspenseful music]

01:11:44.576 --> 01:11:47.441
Do you think she's really gone.

01:11:47.579 --> 01:11:50.409
- Looks like it, goodness.

01:11:50.547 --> 01:11:52.135
Oh, well, she left a note.

01:11:52.273 --> 01:11:54.517
- All her stuff is gone.

01:11:55.966 --> 01:11:57.623
- I couldn't stay
in the same place

01:11:57.761 --> 01:11:59.453
where Lilian died.

01:11:59.591 --> 01:12:03.111
I'm sorry for any trouble
that I caused, Rose.

01:12:03.249 --> 01:12:05.079
- What? What the hell.

01:12:05.217 --> 01:12:07.702
That seems a little strange

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:10.084
because Rose is
fiery and last night

01:12:10.222 --> 01:12:13.156
she was not runaway sad,
she was ready to fight.

01:12:13.294 --> 01:12:14.399
- True.

01:12:15.572 --> 01:12:18.126
I mean, but all of
her stuff is gone.

01:12:18.264 --> 01:12:21.095
- Maybe someone from the
security office saw her leave.

01:12:21.233 --> 01:12:22.096
- Let's go check.

01:12:22.234 --> 01:12:23.580
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:12:26.894 --> 01:12:28.378
- Hi, good afternoon, ladies.

01:12:28.516 --> 01:12:30.138
- Our friend, Rose,
all of her luggage

01:12:30.276 --> 01:12:31.588
is gone from her room and
she left a note saying

01:12:31.726 --> 01:12:33.418
that she's checking out.

01:12:33.556 --> 01:12:34.867
Do you know if she left?

01:12:35.005 --> 01:12:36.524
- I mean, if she left a note,

01:12:36.662 --> 01:12:39.734
she probably left, yes,
you could just call her.

01:12:39.872 --> 01:12:41.460
- She's not answering her phone.

01:12:41.598 --> 01:12:43.428
- Could you just look and see
if she checked out, please.

01:12:43.566 --> 01:12:45.671
- Yeah, of course, who's name
was the room booked under?

01:12:45.809 --> 01:12:47.086
- [Sophia] It's under mine.

01:12:47.224 --> 01:12:49.503
- Can I see your ID, please?
- Sure.

01:12:49.641 --> 01:12:51.090
- Thanks.

01:12:51.228 --> 01:12:54.473
[suspenseful music]

01:12:55.647 --> 01:12:56.993
There's no record of
anyone checking out

01:12:57.131 --> 01:12:59.513
of any of the rooms
listed under your name.

01:12:59.651 --> 01:13:00.962
- That's weird.

01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:02.688
- Did you happen to
see a woman check out

01:13:02.826 --> 01:13:03.965
at all late last night?

01:13:04.103 --> 01:13:04.932
- I didn't.

01:13:05.070 --> 01:13:06.865
- I didn't work last night, no.

01:13:07.003 --> 01:13:09.108
The guy who did, he'll be
in around 8 p.m. tonight.

01:13:09.246 --> 01:13:10.627
You can ask him, though.

01:13:10.765 --> 01:13:11.904
- Okay, thank you.

01:13:12.042 --> 01:13:13.699
Come on, let's go.

01:13:16.771 --> 01:13:19.084
- Still nothing?
- Nothing.

01:13:19.222 --> 01:13:20.292
- Maybe her phone died.

01:13:20.430 --> 01:13:22.328
- Come on, you know her.

01:13:22.467 --> 01:13:23.916
She lives on that thing.

01:13:24.054 --> 01:13:26.263
She has backup chargers
for her backup chargers.

01:13:26.402 --> 01:13:28.162
- So, she's either ignoring us

01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:31.407
or something bad
has happened to her.

01:13:31.545 --> 01:13:33.961
- Something bad has
happened to who?

01:13:34.099 --> 01:13:35.376
- Rose.

01:13:35.514 --> 01:13:36.964
She's missing.

01:13:37.102 --> 01:13:38.862
- Yeah, she's not
answering her phone.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.933
- She's probably still asleep.

01:13:41.071 --> 01:13:43.073
- Well, Kylie had
extra room keys,

01:13:43.211 --> 01:13:45.213
so we checked and all
her luggage is gone.

01:13:45.351 --> 01:13:47.802
- Yeah, the only thing
she left was note.

01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:49.632
- What'd the note say?

01:13:49.770 --> 01:13:51.599
- She said she was leaving early

01:13:51.737 --> 01:13:55.154
and she's sorry for
any trouble she caused.

01:13:55.292 --> 01:13:58.054
- Well, that seems pretty
straightforward to me.

01:13:58.192 --> 01:13:59.987
- No, the front
desk has no record

01:14:00.125 --> 01:14:01.954
of her checking out.

01:14:02.092 --> 01:14:03.922
- Well, if she left at night,

01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:06.131
nobody would see
her checking out.

01:14:06.269 --> 01:14:07.373
- You don't know Rose.

01:14:07.512 --> 01:14:09.168
This isn't like her at all.

01:14:09.306 --> 01:14:11.170
- Okay, y'all, that's enough.

01:14:11.308 --> 01:14:14.864
Speculating isn't
gonna help anything.

01:14:21.318 --> 01:14:22.872
- Good evening,
ladies, can I help you?

01:14:23.010 --> 01:14:25.081
- Yes, were you working
here last night, sir?

01:14:25.219 --> 01:14:26.220
- [Guard] Yes, yes.

01:14:26.358 --> 01:14:27.877
- We're looking for our friend.

01:14:28.015 --> 01:14:29.292
She left us a note saying
she was checking out

01:14:29.430 --> 01:14:30.914
and now we just can't
get a hold of her.

01:14:31.052 --> 01:14:32.226
- Okay, well, I can
check the records here

01:14:32.364 --> 01:14:33.365
and see if she checked out.

01:14:33.503 --> 01:14:34.849
- Oh, we did that last night

01:14:34.987 --> 01:14:36.299
and the clerk said
there's no record.

01:14:36.437 --> 01:14:38.266
We were just wondering
maybe you saw something.

01:14:38.404 --> 01:14:40.027
- I don't recall seeing anything

01:14:40.165 --> 01:14:41.787
or remember anyone
checking out last night

01:14:41.925 --> 01:14:45.032
on my shift, but-
[phone buzzes]

01:14:45.170 --> 01:14:46.654
- Excuse me, did someone
turn in a cell phone?

01:14:46.792 --> 01:14:48.138
I just dialed our
friend's number

01:14:48.276 --> 01:14:49.761
and there's ringing
coming from the office.

01:14:49.899 --> 01:14:50.796
- Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, a hiker found one

01:14:50.934 --> 01:14:52.280
on the trail by the villa.

01:14:52.418 --> 01:14:53.765
He turned it in.

01:14:53.903 --> 01:14:55.249
We're charging it so
people can track it.

01:14:55.387 --> 01:14:56.492
- [Kylie] Okay, when
was it turned in, when?

01:14:56.630 --> 01:14:58.459
- It was early this morning.

01:14:58.597 --> 01:15:00.323
- [Sophia] Can we
have it, please?

01:15:00.461 --> 01:15:02.014
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

01:15:02.152 --> 01:15:05.086
- Perfect, shit,
what's her birthday.

01:15:05.224 --> 01:15:06.950
- October 22, 1994.

01:15:09.090 --> 01:15:10.091
- That's not it.

01:15:10.229 --> 01:15:12.197
Any other significant
event dates

01:15:12.335 --> 01:15:13.612
or favorite numbers.

01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:16.960
- Her mom died, I
think, April 4, 2021.

01:15:20.619 --> 01:15:22.034
- [Sophia] That's not it either.

01:15:22.172 --> 01:15:23.760
- Hey, try 96551.

01:15:25.624 --> 01:15:27.212
- Shit, I'm locked out.

01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:28.834
- You're certain that it was
found outside the resort?

01:15:28.972 --> 01:15:30.422
- Oh, that's what
the gentleman told me

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:31.872
who turned it in.

01:15:32.010 --> 01:15:32.735
- We need to go out
there and look around.

01:15:32.873 --> 01:15:33.874
- We have to go.

01:15:34.012 --> 01:15:35.013
- Now, now, it's not really safe

01:15:35.151 --> 01:15:36.324
out there at night, ladies.

01:15:36.462 --> 01:15:39.327
Tell you what, I'll go out there

01:15:39.465 --> 01:15:40.708
with you, okay?
- Okay.

01:15:40.846 --> 01:15:41.709
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

01:15:41.847 --> 01:15:45.023
[friends chattering]

01:15:47.094 --> 01:15:49.337
- Go for Marrero.
- Copy.

01:15:50.684 --> 01:15:51.995
- Hey, keep an eye
on the front desk.

01:15:52.133 --> 01:15:54.584
I'm gonna go search
the perimeter.

01:15:54.722 --> 01:15:56.241
- [Marrero] Roger that.

01:15:56.379 --> 01:15:58.208
- Okay, let's
search the area here

01:15:58.346 --> 01:16:00.763
and see if there's any
sign of Rose, okay?

01:16:00.901 --> 01:16:02.385
- I think we should split up.

01:16:02.523 --> 01:16:04.801
- Sophia, you go with
the security guard.

01:16:04.939 --> 01:16:07.079
I'll go with Kylie.

01:16:07.217 --> 01:16:08.046
- Okay.

01:16:08.184 --> 01:16:10.738
- Everybody okay with that?

01:16:12.568 --> 01:16:14.362
- Yeah.
- Okay, okay.

01:16:18.263 --> 01:16:18.988
[suspenseful music]

01:16:19.126 --> 01:16:20.610
- After you.

01:16:20.748 --> 01:16:23.993
[suspenseful music]

01:16:31.483 --> 01:16:32.588
- Rose?

01:16:34.486 --> 01:16:35.763
Rose?

01:16:35.901 --> 01:16:37.731
Are you out there?

01:16:38.490 --> 01:16:40.665
Are you seeing anything?

01:16:40.803 --> 01:16:42.149
Okay, well, I'm
just gonna backtrack

01:16:42.287 --> 01:16:45.221
and try and cover where
we haven't been yet.

01:16:45.359 --> 01:16:48.604
[suspenseful music]

01:16:56.577 --> 01:17:00.788
Oh, my God, Rose, Rose [cries].

01:17:01.513 --> 01:17:04.896
Rose, wake up [cries].

01:17:10.004 --> 01:17:12.835
[Kylie grunts]

01:17:16.977 --> 01:17:19.842
[Kylie screams]

01:17:29.714 --> 01:17:31.232
[Kylie gurgles]

01:17:31.370 --> 01:17:34.028
[neck cracks]

01:17:54.877 --> 01:17:55.981
- Rose!

01:17:58.535 --> 01:18:00.261
You recognize this?

01:18:01.469 --> 01:18:03.195
- I've never seen it,

01:18:03.333 --> 01:18:06.371
but that's definitely
not Rose's.

01:18:07.786 --> 01:18:10.409
- Yeah, there's something
weird going on out here,

01:18:10.547 --> 01:18:12.411
something real weird.

01:18:15.069 --> 01:18:16.726
Hey, Marrero.
- What's up?

01:18:16.864 --> 01:18:18.279
- I'm a need you to
get down here quick

01:18:18.417 --> 01:18:21.489
by the old Oak grove.
- On the way.

01:18:22.663 --> 01:18:25.562
[suspenseful music]

01:18:25.701 --> 01:18:28.013
- Does that look strange?

01:18:29.428 --> 01:18:34.364
- It looks like the ground's
been turned over or something.

01:18:35.503 --> 01:18:38.852
Maybe somebody buried
something, I don't know.

01:18:38.990 --> 01:18:42.269
[suspenseful music]

01:18:42.407 --> 01:18:43.270
Oh, Jesus.

01:18:43.408 --> 01:18:46.273
[Sophia screams]

01:18:48.206 --> 01:18:50.518
Hey, is that your friend?

01:18:51.899 --> 01:18:55.282
- No, it looks like the
dancer from the strip club.

01:18:55.420 --> 01:18:57.560
- The dancer from
the strip club.

01:18:57.698 --> 01:18:59.044
- It's a long story.
- Okay.

01:18:59.182 --> 01:19:01.253
- All right, look, we
need to call the cops.

01:19:01.391 --> 01:19:02.807
Come on, let's get outta here.

01:19:02.945 --> 01:19:03.946
- Oh, my God.
- Let's get outta here.

01:19:04.084 --> 01:19:05.085
- Oh, my God.
- Come on.

01:19:05.223 --> 01:19:06.017
- Come on.
- Oh, my God.

01:19:06.155 --> 01:19:07.397
- [Guard] Come on.

01:19:10.228 --> 01:19:11.505
We're gonna call the police.

01:19:11.643 --> 01:19:14.025
- I wouldn't do
that if I were you.

01:19:14.163 --> 01:19:16.924
- Melody, what are you doing?

01:19:18.823 --> 01:19:20.479
- I'm sorry, baby.

01:19:21.549 --> 01:19:24.414
I wish things could've
been different.

01:19:24.552 --> 01:19:25.795
I really do.

01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:29.143
- All this was you? Why?

01:19:31.594 --> 01:19:33.458
- I did this for you.

01:19:34.459 --> 01:19:35.978
For us.

01:19:36.116 --> 01:19:38.739
- Us, why do you keep,
what are you talking about?

01:19:38.877 --> 01:19:41.328
- Sophie, you're in denial.

01:19:42.467 --> 01:19:43.917
You're trapped.

01:19:45.021 --> 01:19:46.402
Don't you see?

01:19:47.817 --> 01:19:52.097
They wouldn't let us be
together, all of them.

01:19:53.409 --> 01:19:57.344
Your friends, your
fiance, the stupid whore.

01:19:59.173 --> 01:20:02.004
They don't care about you.

01:20:02.142 --> 01:20:04.420
They're using you.

01:20:04.558 --> 01:20:06.284
I'm protecting you.

01:20:07.112 --> 01:20:09.459
- Protecting me? From what?

01:20:10.495 --> 01:20:13.532
- Sophie, you've
always loved me.

01:20:16.121 --> 01:20:18.917
They just wouldn't
let you say it.

01:20:19.055 --> 01:20:21.782
They never allowed
us to be together.

01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:23.577
But I found a way.

01:20:24.647 --> 01:20:27.615
- Mel, Mel, you
killed all my friends

01:20:27.753 --> 01:20:29.238
and some innocent dancer.

01:20:29.376 --> 01:20:32.068
- I did what I had to do.

01:20:32.206 --> 01:20:33.898
- What happened,
what's wrong with you?

01:20:34.036 --> 01:20:36.935
- There's nothing wrong with me.

01:20:37.073 --> 01:20:40.180
I've always been protecting you.

01:20:40.318 --> 01:20:42.630
Just like I did with Sam.

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:46.324
- Sam?

01:20:46.462 --> 01:20:47.601
[engine revs]

01:20:47.739 --> 01:20:50.880
[tires screech]

01:20:51.018 --> 01:20:52.330
That was you?

01:20:53.227 --> 01:20:56.161
- Sophie, he was
cheating on you.

01:20:57.611 --> 01:21:01.339
- Mel, it doesn't give you
a right to kill him, Mel.

01:21:01.477 --> 01:21:02.409
Kylie?

01:21:03.513 --> 01:21:04.790
Is Kylie dead?

01:21:04.929 --> 01:21:06.689
- She got in the way.

01:21:06.827 --> 01:21:08.864
- Oh, my God, no, no.

01:21:10.796 --> 01:21:12.143
So what? So what, Mel,
