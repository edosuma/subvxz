<i>Quantum Leap was
an experimental</i>

00:05.527 --> 00:08.051
<i>time travel program
years away from being tested.</i>

00:08.051 --> 00:09.922
Why did you leap?
- I don't remember anything.

00:09.922 --> 00:11.402
Your name is Dr. Ben Song.

00:11.402 --> 00:13.404
<i>You're a time traveler leaping
from life to life,</i>

00:13.404 --> 00:15.145
<i>trying to put right
what once went wrong.</i>

00:15.145 --> 00:17.017
I'm Addison Augustine.
- Addison.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.496
You're the woman I love.

00:18.496 --> 00:19.802
Yeah, Ben.

00:19.802 --> 00:21.064
- He remembered you.
- I know you're worried

00:21.064 --> 00:22.283
about Ben's motivations.

00:22.283 --> 00:23.675
<i>Ben's working with someone.</i>

00:23.675 --> 00:25.416
<i>Al Calavicci's daughter, Janis.</i>

00:25.416 --> 00:27.331
Someone opened a remote link
into the system.

00:27.331 --> 00:28.550
<i>Janis Calavicci.</i>

00:28.550 --> 00:30.247
- What is that?
- That's the destination.

00:30.247 --> 00:32.554
I think that Ben was trying
to leap into the future

00:32.554 --> 00:35.035
<i>to a specific place,
a specific point in time.</i>

00:35.035 --> 00:36.123
That shouldn't be possible.

00:36.123 --> 00:37.428
I remember.

00:37.428 --> 00:38.690
- Remember what?
- Why I leapt

00:38.690 --> 00:40.040
in the first place.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.520
It's to save you.

00:42.520 --> 00:43.521
What?

00:53.270 --> 00:55.794
Out of the shot!

00:55.794 --> 00:57.144
Yeah, you, step aside!

00:58.536 --> 01:00.495
Come on, boys,
be nice to Jack.

01:00.495 --> 01:03.367
After all, my life
is in his hands.

01:03.367 --> 01:05.804
Carly! I love you!

01:05.804 --> 01:08.155
I love you!
I love you, I love you!

01:10.244 --> 01:11.375
We better head inside.

01:11.375 --> 01:13.073
We're on a tight schedule.

01:23.561 --> 01:26.390
After sound check,
it's back to the suite

01:26.390 --> 01:29.567
for a small VIP gathering
and one interview.

01:30.873 --> 01:32.266
It's part of the job, Carly.

01:32.266 --> 01:33.919
Did I complain?

01:33.919 --> 01:35.312
Do I ever complain,

01:35.312 --> 01:36.705
even if I might want
to complain?

01:36.705 --> 01:38.228
Ms. Farmer,
your dressing room,

01:38.228 --> 01:39.664
which is obviously
supposed to be ready,

01:39.664 --> 01:41.797
isn't ready.
I am so sorry.

01:41.797 --> 01:43.581
Oh, it's Amanda, isn't it?

01:43.581 --> 01:44.713
Don't worry about
the dressing room.

01:44.713 --> 01:45.888
It's a sound check.

01:45.888 --> 01:48.412
More importantly,
how's your mom doing?

01:48.412 --> 01:50.545
Huh? She was sick
the last time I was here.

01:50.545 --> 01:52.329
She's much better.
Thank you.

01:52.329 --> 01:54.810
I-I can't believe
you remember that.

Hi.

03:15.238 --> 03:17.371
- Hi.
- Sorry about that

03:17.371 --> 03:19.155
dramatic exit last time.

03:19.155 --> 03:21.505
Not your fault.

03:21.505 --> 03:24.160
So tell me everything.

03:24.160 --> 03:26.206
Well, it's
coming back slowly.

03:26.206 --> 03:29.687
I remember working with
that woman, Janis Calavicci.

03:29.687 --> 03:32.603
I remember knowing
that what I was doing

03:32.603 --> 03:34.997
was the only way
I could save you,

03:34.997 --> 03:37.391
but I just don't remember

03:37.391 --> 03:39.349
from what.

03:39.349 --> 03:40.829
And I, uh, don't suppose

03:40.829 --> 03:42.657
you remember
why you couldn't tell me.

03:44.136 --> 03:45.137
I know you're upset.
I--

03:45.137 --> 03:46.530
Well, I just feel like,
of things

03:46.530 --> 03:48.271
to say to your fiancée,
"you're in danger"

03:48.271 --> 03:49.446
feels like the top of that.

03:49.446 --> 03:51.318
I'm just as frustrated
as you are,

03:51.318 --> 03:52.536
and I'll remember.
I'm sure of it.

03:52.536 --> 03:55.147
OK, let's just focus
on the leap.

03:55.147 --> 03:56.366
It's 1979.

03:56.366 --> 03:57.846
I'm a bodyguard
named Jack Armstrong.

03:57.846 --> 03:59.369
I'm here with a singer
named Carly Farmer,

03:59.369 --> 04:00.718
and it's the day
before the concert.

04:00.718 --> 04:02.416
There, now we can
have our conversation.

04:02.416 --> 04:05.070
No, we can't.

04:05.070 --> 04:07.856
Ziggy says Carly died on stage

04:07.856 --> 04:09.074
in her sound check.

04:09.074 --> 04:10.206
That's--that's now.

04:10.206 --> 04:13.296
♪ Another day, another song

04:13.296 --> 04:16.081

coming down.

04:18.693 --> 04:24.089

04:27.963 --> 04:29.269

04:29.269 --> 04:30.270

04:30.270 --> 04:32.097
Are you OK?
You OK?

04:34.056 --> 04:37.320
Somebody tell me
what the hell just happened!

04:37.320 --> 04:39.104
Carly, are you OK?

04:39.104 --> 04:41.324
Ben,

04:41.324 --> 04:42.717
I don't think
that was an accident.

04:42.717 --> 04:44.284
Ziggy says now
that Carly doesn't die

04:44.284 --> 04:45.633
in her sound check,

04:45.633 --> 04:47.330
she's murdered tonight.

04:56.470 --> 04:58.950
So what do we know?

04:58.950 --> 05:00.909
Just that Addison is going
to die?

05:00.909 --> 05:02.389
Actually,
Ben didn't say that.

05:02.389 --> 05:03.738
He said he leapt to save her.

05:03.738 --> 05:05.740
The man stepped
into a quantum accelerator

05:05.740 --> 05:07.176
with no way of coming home.

05:07.176 --> 05:08.612
You don't do that unless

05:08.612 --> 05:10.658
the person you love is
in real danger.

05:10.658 --> 05:11.920
I agree with Magic.

05:11.920 --> 05:14.009
I think
if Ben is using the leaps

05:14.009 --> 05:15.445
to try to build up
enough momentum

05:15.445 --> 05:17.534
to get to a specific point
in the future,

05:17.534 --> 05:19.580
I think it's pretty likely

05:19.580 --> 05:21.321
that that point might be
Addison's death.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.713
It just doesn't
make any sense.

05:22.713 --> 05:23.975
Ben left Addison a message

05:23.975 --> 05:25.368
saying this is bigger
than all of us.

05:25.368 --> 05:26.761
Ah.

05:26.761 --> 05:28.806
You're making my head hurt.

05:28.806 --> 05:30.591
And you're focusing
on the wrong thing.

05:30.591 --> 05:32.680
It's bad enough
we may never get Ben back.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.595
Now Addison is at risk too?

05:34.595 --> 05:36.205
We're not gonna let
anything happen to her.

05:36.205 --> 05:38.294
How do we prevent something
from happening

05:38.294 --> 05:40.296
if we don't know
what the something is?

05:40.296 --> 05:42.646
Ben didn't tell us or Addison.

05:42.646 --> 05:45.257
The only person who might know
is the one person

05:45.257 --> 05:47.477
he went to for help.

05:47.477 --> 05:48.696
Janis Calavicci.

05:48.696 --> 05:50.393
She's been running circles
around us

05:50.393 --> 05:52.395
from day one.

05:52.395 --> 05:55.790
But if she's helping
Ben save Addison,

05:55.790 --> 05:58.314
is it possible
she could be on our side?

05:58.314 --> 06:00.403
Let's ask her.

06:00.403 --> 06:03.188
You remember how Janis tried
to use Ziggy

06:03.188 --> 06:05.713
in order to predict
what we might do in the future?

06:05.713 --> 06:08.063
Well, I repurposed her code

06:08.063 --> 06:10.370
in order to have Ziggy predict
where she would have gone

06:10.370 --> 06:11.762
when she put us in lockdown.

06:11.762 --> 06:15.200
Now, these are the 40 most
probable destinations.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.680
We're a clandestine program,

06:16.680 --> 06:18.421
few dozen personnel,

06:18.421 --> 06:20.641
access to one jet
if we're lucky.

06:20.641 --> 06:23.034
How are we gonna search
40 cities around the world?

06:23.034 --> 06:24.384
She's in Belize--

06:24.384 --> 06:25.776
frequented by tourists
so she doesn't stick out,

06:25.776 --> 06:27.517
notoriously flexible customs,

06:27.517 --> 06:29.780
and located next
to a new power plant

06:29.780 --> 06:31.086
so she can try
to reach Ben again.

06:32.566 --> 06:33.654
That's where I'd go.

06:35.133 --> 06:36.874
Let's get you that jet.

06:44.055 --> 06:45.753
Is that Elton John?

06:45.753 --> 06:46.580
It is.

06:46.580 --> 06:49.278
Maybe he murders Carly.

06:49.278 --> 06:50.540
He would never do that.

06:51.628 --> 06:53.891
Anything new from Ziggy?

06:53.891 --> 06:56.241
Mm. Carly is going
to be stabbed to death

06:56.241 --> 06:58.983
at 10:15 tonight while walking
along Lakeshore Drive.

06:58.983 --> 07:01.029
OK, so whoever rigged

07:01.029 --> 07:03.553
that light must have known
Carly's routine.

07:03.553 --> 07:05.076
So we should check
her entourage.

07:05.076 --> 07:07.252
Cherise does her makeup.

07:07.252 --> 07:09.080
Dante, her hair stylist.

07:09.080 --> 07:13.345
We've got Loretta and Dionne,
her backup singers.

07:13.345 --> 07:15.826
Come to think of it, we should
check everyone in her band.

07:15.826 --> 07:17.567
Yeah.
Ooh, stop talking.

07:17.567 --> 07:19.569
Carly's behind you.

07:19.569 --> 07:21.397
Guess there's no
sneaking up on you.

07:21.397 --> 07:23.834
It's kind of my job.

07:25.532 --> 07:27.708
How did you see that light?

07:27.708 --> 07:30.101
How'd you move so fast?

07:31.625 --> 07:33.801
I guess also kind of part
of your job...

07:33.801 --> 07:35.933
- Mm.
- I guess.

07:37.544 --> 07:39.154
That was a freak accident, huh?

07:41.678 --> 07:43.593
Tell her, Ben.

07:43.593 --> 07:46.074
It's not fair
to keep her in the dark.

07:46.074 --> 07:48.163
Doesn't make it
any less scary.

07:50.992 --> 07:52.472
No, it doesn't.

07:54.604 --> 07:55.779
I need some air.

08:00.001 --> 08:01.437
All right, well,
I'm still not getting

08:01.437 --> 08:02.786
anything from Ziggy.

08:02.786 --> 08:03.918
I'm gonna go back
and do some research

08:03.918 --> 08:05.485
on Carly's murder.
- OK.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.588
This is some view.

08:30.553 --> 08:31.859
I'm sorry.

08:31.859 --> 08:33.556
I thought after
what you said last week

08:33.556 --> 08:35.123
that you were interested.
- I'm sure I am.

08:35.123 --> 08:36.907
Oh, my God, I don't--
I don't--

08:36.907 --> 08:38.605
I don't want you to think that
I'm one of those needy artists

08:38.605 --> 08:39.780
that just expects things.

08:39.780 --> 08:41.129
I-I don't--
I don't think that.

08:41.129 --> 08:45.525
I-I just think that you've
been through a lot.

08:45.525 --> 08:49.616
And--and I need to focus
on doing my job.

08:54.751 --> 08:56.448
God, it's strange, isn't it?

08:56.448 --> 08:57.667
This life.

08:57.667 --> 08:58.929
Always on the road,

08:58.929 --> 09:02.063
traveling from city to city,

09:02.063 --> 09:04.979
never going home.

09:04.979 --> 09:08.025
The longer you're gone,
the harder it gets.

09:08.025 --> 09:10.375
Yeah.

09:10.375 --> 09:13.988
You start thinking less
about where you're going,

09:13.988 --> 09:17.165
more about who you left behind
to get here.

09:18.862 --> 09:20.995
Goodness.

09:20.995 --> 09:22.387
That's about as much
of a pity party

09:22.387 --> 09:24.085
as I've thrown in a while.

09:27.392 --> 09:31.179
As if I weren't the luckiest
woman on the planet.

09:31.179 --> 09:32.833
I don't mean
to disturb you two,

09:32.833 --> 09:35.226
but Trevor's looking for Jack.

09:42.103 --> 09:43.974
Jamie's here,
and we can't find Trevor.

09:43.974 --> 09:46.150
- Jamie...
- Carly's younger sister.

09:46.150 --> 09:48.370
Oh, that Jamie.
She's here?

09:48.370 --> 09:50.241
She says she has a ticket
to the show tomorrow

09:50.241 --> 09:52.417
and claims she was invited
to this party.

09:52.417 --> 09:54.898
Which obviously, she wasn't.

09:54.898 --> 09:56.247
OK, I'll tell Carly.

09:56.247 --> 09:57.640
Jack, are you insane?

09:57.640 --> 09:59.076
She has enough
to worry about already,

09:59.076 --> 10:01.252
and you want to tell her,
her junkie sister is here?

10:01.252 --> 10:02.384
Just get rid of her.

10:10.522 --> 10:11.654
See?
I told you.

10:11.654 --> 10:13.395
I'm her sister.

10:13.395 --> 10:15.179
I've got it from here.

10:18.574 --> 10:20.315
Jamie Farmer.
Nice to meet you.

10:20.315 --> 10:21.882
Jack Armstrong. Hi.

10:21.882 --> 10:24.754
Uh, Ben, I just finished
looking at the court records.

10:24.754 --> 10:28.453
Jamie murdered Carly Farmer.

10:28.453 --> 10:30.455
I've heard such great things.

10:36.070 --> 10:37.724
I was so excited
when Carly sent me the ticket.

10:37.724 --> 10:40.030
Oh, and she did
invite me tonight,

10:40.030 --> 10:41.815
so you can tell Trevor
to stick it.

10:44.034 --> 10:47.647
"To a small gathering
of Carly's closest friends."

10:51.738 --> 10:54.784
What, you're not gonna
let me in either?

10:54.784 --> 10:57.395
Oh.

10:57.395 --> 11:00.398
Somebody screwed up,
didn't they?

11:00.398 --> 11:03.097
This is a work thing, and
that invitation wasn't for me.

11:03.097 --> 11:05.360
I'm afraid not.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.579
I appreciate your honesty.

11:07.579 --> 11:09.886
Not a lot of that around here.

11:09.886 --> 11:14.195
Truth is, I'm just grateful
she sent the ticket.

11:14.195 --> 11:17.720
She did mean that part, right?

11:17.720 --> 11:20.941
No, she didn't.
No, she didn't--

11:20.941 --> 11:23.291
Yes, she did.

11:23.291 --> 11:24.727
You are unbelievable.

11:26.163 --> 11:27.730
Thank God.

11:27.730 --> 11:29.950
That's good and frankly,

11:29.950 --> 11:32.387
very generous
after all I've put her through.

11:32.387 --> 11:34.432
But I've been clean and sober
for a while now.

11:36.957 --> 11:39.481
Will you tell her I love her

11:39.481 --> 11:41.657
and that I'll be cheering?

11:41.657 --> 11:43.920
And if for some reason
she wants to find me

11:43.920 --> 11:46.227
after the concert,
I'm staying at the Budget Inn.

11:52.842 --> 11:54.496
She murders Carly?

11:54.496 --> 11:56.019
Are we sure?
I mean,

11:56.019 --> 11:58.326
I-I know I give people
the benefit of the doubt, but--

11:58.326 --> 12:00.676
Like Tammy Jean,
the damsel in distress

12:00.676 --> 12:03.157
who turned out
to be a drug lord?

12:04.332 --> 12:05.637
Point taken,

12:05.637 --> 12:06.943
but she doesn't seem
like a killer, does she?

12:06.943 --> 12:09.685
Most killers don't
seem like killers, Ben.

12:09.685 --> 12:11.687
That's why they're successful.

12:11.687 --> 12:14.734
But Jamie was tried and
convicted of murdering Carly.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.779
And it only took the jury
45 minutes to do it.

12:16.779 --> 12:19.695
I hear you, but--
but humor me, OK?

12:19.695 --> 12:21.001
What were the facts
of the case?

12:21.001 --> 12:22.219
Ben.

12:22.219 --> 12:23.568
Let me dig into it with Ian.

12:23.568 --> 12:25.353
Addison, it's 7:30.

12:25.353 --> 12:26.789
Carly dies in less
than three hours.

12:26.789 --> 12:27.747
I'll be quick.

12:30.401 --> 12:33.404
I am sitting here
with music superstar,

12:33.404 --> 12:35.363
Carly Farmer.

12:35.363 --> 12:37.974
Carly, welcome back to Chicago.

12:37.974 --> 12:39.541
Oh, it's great to be back.

12:39.541 --> 12:43.153
I love it here.
I am a deep-dish gal.

12:43.153 --> 12:46.940
OK, so please tell us,
how has your tour been going?

12:46.940 --> 12:49.377
Hey, can you pull up
everything you can find

12:49.377 --> 12:51.553
on the trial of Jamie Farmer?

12:51.553 --> 12:53.207
Ooh, you know
I'm a true crime addict.

12:53.207 --> 12:55.078
So what are we looking for?

12:55.078 --> 12:56.732
Evidence she was framed.

12:56.732 --> 12:58.255
Oh, wow,
you just made my day.

12:58.255 --> 12:59.866
Wait, you really think
that's possible?

12:59.866 --> 13:00.823
Yeah.

13:00.823 --> 13:02.433
Look, when I was
eight years old,

13:02.433 --> 13:04.044
I realized that about
half of the world

13:04.044 --> 13:06.742
just blindly accepted as true
the construct of gender

13:06.742 --> 13:10.311
that is both artificial
and profoundly limiting.

13:10.311 --> 13:12.617
So yeah, I am pretty suspicious

13:12.617 --> 13:14.794
of basically anything
that people say is a fact.

13:16.099 --> 13:17.884
There's a song
on your new album

13:17.884 --> 13:20.408
that's about
your sister, Jamie.

13:20.408 --> 13:22.758
When is the last time
you saw Jamie?

13:22.758 --> 13:24.542
Excuse me.
That was not on the list

13:24.542 --> 13:25.717
of approved questions.

13:25.717 --> 13:27.241
Um, it's fine.

13:29.156 --> 13:31.332
Um...

13:31.332 --> 13:33.638
it's been six years.

13:34.901 --> 13:37.120
Looks like a history
of substance abuse,

13:37.120 --> 13:39.253
which people always vilify.

13:39.253 --> 13:41.081
But then--then there's

13:41.081 --> 13:42.386
a history of jealousy,

13:42.386 --> 13:45.128
a restraining order
taken out by Carly,

13:45.128 --> 13:47.914
a psychiatric intervention.

13:51.091 --> 13:53.354
You know, Jamie,

13:53.354 --> 13:55.965
she was the real talent
of the family.

13:55.965 --> 13:59.142
She--the voice of an angel.

13:59.142 --> 14:02.102
And, uh, she actually used
to write all my songs.

14:02.102 --> 14:03.538
Speaking of the psycho,

14:03.538 --> 14:06.628
Loretta said she showed up.

14:06.628 --> 14:09.413
Actually, she seemed
pretty sane to me.

14:09.413 --> 14:11.676
Healthy, eager to reconnect,

14:11.676 --> 14:14.897
which it seems like
Carly is too.

14:16.377 --> 14:18.814
Come with me, Jack.

14:18.814 --> 14:21.164
Well, moving on
to brighter subjects,

14:21.164 --> 14:22.470
everyone wants to know...

14:26.822 --> 14:29.607
Besides finding the murder
weapon in Jamie's hotel room,

14:29.607 --> 14:31.305
Jamie also doesn't
have an alibi

14:31.305 --> 14:32.393
for the time of the murder.

14:32.393 --> 14:34.482
And then there's,
you know, these--

14:34.482 --> 14:36.745
six years
of threatening letters.

14:36.745 --> 14:38.529
Always keep a sample on hand

14:38.529 --> 14:40.314
in case local
law enforcement don't take

14:40.314 --> 14:41.706
the threat seriously enough.

14:41.706 --> 14:43.839
Hired a private investigator.

14:43.839 --> 14:46.755
He traced it straight back
to Jamie.

14:46.755 --> 14:49.323
OK, well, this feels like
an open-and-shut case.

14:49.323 --> 14:51.499
Or it's a perfect frame.

14:51.499 --> 14:52.935
OK, start with the letters.

14:52.935 --> 14:54.719
If you were angry
with your sister,

14:54.719 --> 14:56.547
would you really bother
with a typewriter?

14:56.547 --> 14:57.853
And then there's
the actual crime.

14:57.853 --> 14:59.202
I mean, she kills her sister,

14:59.202 --> 15:00.943
but gets no blood on herself.

15:00.943 --> 15:02.945
And then she takes the bloody
knife back to her hotel room.

15:02.945 --> 15:04.120
I mean, how did
she even do that?

15:04.120 --> 15:06.557
Just seal it in a bag
and transport it?

15:11.475 --> 15:12.694
What is that?

15:12.694 --> 15:14.217
This is the invitation
Jamie received.

15:14.217 --> 15:16.045
Just wanted to see if it's
the same typewriter.

15:19.396 --> 15:21.964
You should have shown me this
right when you got it.

15:25.011 --> 15:26.012
That's proof then.

15:26.012 --> 15:27.927
Psycho invited herself,

15:27.927 --> 15:29.537
tried to get in.

15:29.537 --> 15:30.930
You need to watch her, Jack.

15:33.062 --> 15:35.325
And don't tell Carly
she was here.

15:39.634 --> 15:40.983
Looks like I was wrong.

15:40.983 --> 15:42.680
Maybe not.

15:44.856 --> 15:48.512
Someone stands to make
tens of millions of dollars

15:48.512 --> 15:50.993
if Carly dies--

15:50.993 --> 15:52.342
Trevor.

16:06.269 --> 16:09.925
You happen to know
the Wi-Fi password?

16:09.925 --> 16:11.709
I don't.

16:14.147 --> 16:16.018
But please, take a seat, Jenn.

16:16.018 --> 16:17.411
Thanks.

16:21.850 --> 16:23.417
Anyone else looking
over here would think

16:23.417 --> 16:25.375
we were just two girlfriends
on holiday.

16:25.375 --> 16:27.203
Enjoying the sun, the beach.

16:27.203 --> 16:29.553
The lack of extradition
treaty with the US.

16:29.553 --> 16:31.903
I'm not here
to arrest you, Janis.

16:31.903 --> 16:33.340
I just want to talk.

16:33.340 --> 16:35.472
Well, in that case,
let's get you a drink.

16:35.472 --> 16:37.692
Considering you drugged
your own mother's tea,

16:37.692 --> 16:38.736
I'll pass.

16:38.736 --> 16:41.130
Family's complicated.

16:41.130 --> 16:42.914
But you know that, right?

16:42.914 --> 16:44.351
Your dad's a gambling addict?

16:44.351 --> 16:46.918
And you're the daughter
of the great Al Calavicci.

16:46.918 --> 16:50.400
But somehow I'm the one
who ended up at Quantum Leap.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.315
If you're trying to piss
me off, it's not gonna work.

16:52.315 --> 16:54.187
Because you don't care
about anything?

16:54.187 --> 16:56.406
Yeah.
That's what I thought at first.

16:56.406 --> 16:59.061
But then I realized,
you're risking everything

16:59.061 --> 17:02.673
to help Ben save
Addison's life.

17:02.673 --> 17:03.761
How is she gonna die?

17:06.155 --> 17:07.983
You were doing really well

17:07.983 --> 17:09.158
until you asked that question

17:09.158 --> 17:10.594
instead of the one
you should be asking.

17:10.594 --> 17:11.943
Which is?

17:11.943 --> 17:14.685
Why did Ben come to me
when he had all of you?

17:17.949 --> 17:19.516
Trevor signs Carly,

17:19.516 --> 17:21.127
her sister, Jamie,
falls into drugs...

17:21.127 --> 17:24.652
Which is when Trevor starts
"helping" Carly write lyrics.

17:24.652 --> 17:27.263
So then he becomes
her songwriting partner.

17:27.263 --> 17:29.396
Write a word, get a third,
as they say.

17:29.396 --> 17:31.050
But if he's getting a third,
then why kill her?

17:31.050 --> 17:32.181
Because he isn't credited

17:32.181 --> 17:34.966
with any of the songs
on "Traveler."

17:34.966 --> 17:36.403
So the money well dried up.

17:36.403 --> 17:39.319
And with Carly dead
and Jamie in jail,

17:39.319 --> 17:41.016
Trevor ends up
with all the publishing rights

17:41.016 --> 17:42.191
to Carly's music.

17:42.191 --> 17:45.934
He makes $50 million
after she dies.

17:45.934 --> 17:47.544
Wow, OK.
So we have motive,

17:47.544 --> 17:49.198
but still no proof
he killed her.

17:49.198 --> 17:52.114
And we're running out of time.

17:52.114 --> 17:54.856
I have an idea.

17:54.856 --> 17:56.553
Why don't we set a trap?

17:56.553 --> 17:59.339
I mean, we know Carly is
murdered on Lakeshore Drive.

17:59.339 --> 18:00.862
Addison, I'm a bodyguard.

18:00.862 --> 18:03.256
My job is to protect her,
not use her as bait.

18:03.256 --> 18:05.606
Yeah, that's why you tell her
about the plan

18:05.606 --> 18:07.564
and let her have a say
in how she protects herself.

18:07.564 --> 18:09.218
And tell her what,
my hologram told me

18:09.218 --> 18:10.306
that you're going to die?

18:10.306 --> 18:11.655
You're her bodyguard, Ben.

18:11.655 --> 18:12.917
If you say
that she's in danger,

18:12.917 --> 18:14.049
she's gonna believe you.

18:14.049 --> 18:15.746
She trusts you.

18:15.746 --> 18:17.574
Try trusting her.

18:19.794 --> 18:22.101
Is this about Carly
or about us?

18:25.800 --> 18:27.149
Addison, I'm sorry.

18:27.149 --> 18:30.239
I-I--I don't know
why I didn't tell you,

18:30.239 --> 18:32.023
but I have to believe
there's a good reason.

18:32.023 --> 18:33.286
Really?

18:33.286 --> 18:35.418
Because I have been
racking my brain

18:35.418 --> 18:37.420
to come up with a single
good reason to keep a secret

18:37.420 --> 18:39.205
like that from the person
that you love,

18:39.205 --> 18:42.817
and I can't think of anything.

18:42.817 --> 18:46.908
We were a team, Ben.

18:57.788 --> 19:00.574
Uh, you should go.

19:00.574 --> 19:02.793
I'll see what proof
I can dig up.

19:13.326 --> 19:14.631
What are you doing?

19:14.631 --> 19:17.025
Uh, what I always do
when I'm in Chicago,

19:17.025 --> 19:18.548
going for a walk
along the lake.

19:18.548 --> 19:21.595
Carly, I can't
let you do that.

19:21.595 --> 19:23.292
Jack, what aren't
you telling me?

19:26.513 --> 19:29.298
Your sister's
here in Chicago.

19:29.298 --> 19:30.995
- She is?
- Damn it.

19:30.995 --> 19:32.649
I told you not to say anything.

19:32.649 --> 19:33.998
- Why not?
- Because she tried

19:33.998 --> 19:35.130
to get in here.

19:35.130 --> 19:36.262
She's unstable.

19:36.262 --> 19:37.437
And you got enough
to worry about.

19:39.482 --> 19:41.745
Jack, did you see her?

19:41.745 --> 19:42.877
How'd she look?

19:42.877 --> 19:46.533
I mean, did--
did she seem unstable?

19:46.533 --> 19:48.578
And you think what,
she--she would hurt me?

19:48.578 --> 19:51.233
I have no proof
she's dangerous,

19:51.233 --> 19:54.584
but I think there's a threat.

19:54.584 --> 19:57.544
So right now, I think it's best
if you don't see each other.

20:00.895 --> 20:02.244
You know what?

20:02.244 --> 20:04.115
You're both wrong.

20:04.115 --> 20:07.206
Jamie might have her problems,
but she would never hurt me.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.207
I'd like to go out,
and I don't want

20:08.207 --> 20:09.208
either of you coming with me.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.818
Carly, I cannot let you walk

20:10.818 --> 20:12.123
along Lakeshore Drive.

20:12.123 --> 20:13.647
You said yourself that's
something you always do,

20:13.647 --> 20:16.258
and right now, anything routine
could be dangerous.

20:16.258 --> 20:17.520
I'm your bodyguard.

20:17.520 --> 20:19.566
You pay me to protect you
from everyone,

20:19.566 --> 20:21.307
and tonight that includes
from yourself.

20:27.878 --> 20:29.576
Fine.

20:29.576 --> 20:31.882
I won't go for a walk.

20:33.971 --> 20:35.712
But we are still going out.

20:47.028 --> 20:49.117
Well, having been
a warrior once myself,

20:49.117 --> 20:51.728
I know a little bit
about the warrior's mindset.

20:51.728 --> 20:54.905
Yeah, well, look,
I appreciate it, Magic,

20:54.905 --> 20:58.126
but Ben's on a clock right now,
and I'm fine, so.

20:58.126 --> 20:59.867
This is our ninth leap, Addison.

20:59.867 --> 21:02.086
Let's not hide
behind words like "fine,"

21:02.086 --> 21:04.437
not when he said he's
doing this to save you.

21:06.787 --> 21:10.051
OK, I'm angry.

21:10.051 --> 21:11.270
Is that what you want to hear?

21:11.270 --> 21:12.314
I mean, it's bad enough

21:12.314 --> 21:13.489
that he kept me in the dark

21:13.489 --> 21:14.534
about what he is doing,

21:14.534 --> 21:18.494
but then to say
it was about me,

21:18.494 --> 21:21.715
to deny me the chance
to protect myself, I mean...

21:23.978 --> 21:26.589
Who does that to someone
that they love?

21:26.589 --> 21:29.200
I agree with you.

21:29.200 --> 21:30.332
You do?

21:30.332 --> 21:32.421
When I heard what Ben said--

21:32.421 --> 21:35.337
I wanted to throttle him.

21:35.337 --> 21:37.600
And I love him like a son.

21:37.600 --> 21:40.255
We who doing everything
to save him,

21:40.255 --> 21:41.735
are under attack,
and he didn't say

21:41.735 --> 21:43.867
a damn thing before he left.

21:45.913 --> 21:48.742
When you put it that way,
it, uh--

21:48.742 --> 21:50.309
it really sucks.

21:51.788 --> 21:53.355
It does.

21:55.618 --> 21:59.753
And that's why we have to share

21:59.753 --> 22:02.451
the burden of these feelings

22:02.451 --> 22:05.149
and not bottle them up.

22:05.149 --> 22:07.064
We're a team, Addison,

22:07.064 --> 22:08.936
now more than ever.

22:11.808 --> 22:13.941
Thanks, Magic.

22:21.209 --> 22:23.472
Wait, do you see the way
Jack's watching us all?

22:23.472 --> 22:25.561
Handsome, you need
to go off the clock.

22:25.561 --> 22:26.954
That's the thing
about this job.

22:26.954 --> 22:28.912
You only really sleep
when it ends.

22:28.912 --> 22:31.001
Well, thanks
for letting our canary

22:31.001 --> 22:32.655
out of her cage at least.

22:32.655 --> 22:35.266
To you, Carly.
- Oh, no, no.

22:35.266 --> 22:38.008
To you, all of you, my family.

22:38.008 --> 22:39.967
- We love you, Red.
- Yes, if anything were

22:39.967 --> 22:41.795
to happen to you,
I don't know what I'd do.

22:41.795 --> 22:43.623
You're sounding
kind of creepy, Dante.

22:43.623 --> 22:45.712
It's just, when I think
about what happened today--

22:45.712 --> 22:47.409
You were incredible, Jack.

22:47.409 --> 22:49.368
- Here, here.
- I agree.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.108
And you're sexy as hell.

22:51.108 --> 22:54.155
But given your determination
to remain a monk,

22:54.155 --> 22:57.158
I think I'll have to go find
my future ex-husband elsewhere.

22:58.681 --> 23:00.509
I thought
Loretta was seeing someone.

23:00.509 --> 23:01.858
She's always in love.

23:01.858 --> 23:03.120
Who wants another round?
- Ooh.

23:03.120 --> 23:04.295
I want some better music.

23:04.295 --> 23:07.037
Uh, I pick the music.

23:13.870 --> 23:15.959
I'm sorry
I snapped at you before.

23:15.959 --> 23:17.004
No.

23:18.484 --> 23:21.225
You know, I, uh,
never wanted to sing.

23:21.225 --> 23:24.054
I mean, I love it now,
but, um, I only did it

23:24.054 --> 23:27.318
because Jamie signed us up
for a talent show.

23:27.318 --> 23:32.541
And I had to go
because she's my little sister.

23:32.541 --> 23:34.151
And it was my job
to protect her.

23:36.763 --> 23:39.418
We can't always protect
the people we love

23:39.418 --> 23:41.463
the way we'd like to.

23:41.463 --> 23:43.944
Ben, you were right.

23:43.944 --> 23:45.685
I keep expecting her
to show up

23:45.685 --> 23:47.556
and be the Jamie I remember.

23:47.556 --> 23:49.906
I had Ziggy run an analysis
on the letters

23:49.906 --> 23:52.431
that her sister
supposedly sent.

23:52.431 --> 23:55.477
Grammar, syntax, vocabulary--

23:55.477 --> 23:58.088
Trevor wrote them.

23:58.088 --> 24:01.396
To keep them apart
and the money flowing.

24:01.396 --> 24:02.484
Come again?

24:02.484 --> 24:05.400
You have to tell her, Ben.

24:05.400 --> 24:08.185
I don't care
if you can't prove it.

24:08.185 --> 24:09.360
Give her that information

24:09.360 --> 24:10.536
and let her decide
what to do with it.

24:10.536 --> 24:12.015
What?

24:13.930 --> 24:15.497
Carly, there's something
you should know.

24:19.153 --> 24:21.155
Trevor wrote those letters.

24:21.155 --> 24:24.071
He did it to keep you
and Jamie apart.

24:29.119 --> 24:31.513
Carly! Carly!

24:31.513 --> 24:35.125
I deserted her
for all of those years!

24:35.125 --> 24:36.300
The restraining order!

24:36.300 --> 24:37.388
She must hate me.

24:37.388 --> 24:38.651
No, no, she doesn't hate you.

24:38.651 --> 24:40.174
She loves you.

24:40.174 --> 24:41.697
Just breathe.

24:43.569 --> 24:45.527
We can't change the past.

24:47.616 --> 24:50.271
We can't change
the choices we've made,

24:50.271 --> 24:53.274
but we can change
what we do moving forward.

24:55.015 --> 24:58.279
We do this one step at a time

24:58.279 --> 24:59.672
together from now on.

25:04.285 --> 25:05.982
Ben, look out!

25:05.982 --> 25:06.940
Watch out!

25:14.600 --> 25:15.688
- Did you see the driver?
- No.

25:15.688 --> 25:16.993
Did you?
- No.

25:16.993 --> 25:18.342
But that light today wasn't
an accident,

25:18.342 --> 25:20.301
was it?

25:20.301 --> 25:22.869
Someone's trying to kill me.

25:29.789 --> 25:32.182
How was your date?

25:33.662 --> 25:36.230
Was that you driving
the car just now?

25:36.230 --> 25:37.492
Bad enough you've been
lying to me for years.

25:37.492 --> 25:38.841
Now you want to kill me?
- What the hell

25:38.841 --> 25:39.886
are you talking about?

25:39.886 --> 25:41.061
I know about the letters.

25:41.061 --> 25:42.584
I know they didn't come
from Jamie.

25:42.584 --> 25:43.759
They came from you.

25:43.759 --> 25:45.326
You kept her out of my life

25:45.326 --> 25:47.197
to keep yourself rich.

25:48.503 --> 25:50.636
I was trying to protect you.

25:50.636 --> 25:52.115
Jamie is dangerous.

25:52.115 --> 25:55.641
She always has been.
She always will be.

25:55.641 --> 25:58.252
And I love you, Carly.

25:58.252 --> 26:00.080
I've always loved you.

26:03.344 --> 26:06.260
You're fired, Trevor.

26:06.260 --> 26:08.262
I want you to get out.

26:11.657 --> 26:12.614
- Carly.
- Now.

26:12.614 --> 26:14.834
Carly.

26:14.834 --> 26:16.966
Gonna need your access badge.

26:16.966 --> 26:18.664
Can't have you showing up backstage.

26:30.110 --> 26:31.720
This isn't over--
- Bye, Trevor.

26:40.250 --> 26:44.211
Do you think it was him...
trying to kill me?

26:44.211 --> 26:47.518
I don't know,
but I'm gonna find out.

26:47.518 --> 26:49.651
And if it isn't Trevor,
I'm gonna catch whoever it is.

26:49.651 --> 26:52.306
All this time, I thought
Jamie was getting worse.

26:52.306 --> 26:55.222
She was getting better.

26:55.222 --> 26:58.225
Six years.

26:58.225 --> 26:59.705
I can't get that time back.

27:03.883 --> 27:05.711
Call Jamie.

27:05.711 --> 27:09.236
You two still have
so much time you can share.

27:09.236 --> 27:12.805
Don't waste even one minute
being afraid.

27:23.554 --> 27:25.382
So is Uncle Sam gonna
pick up the tab,

27:25.382 --> 27:26.775
or you want me to chip in?

27:26.775 --> 27:27.733
I'll take care of it.

27:27.733 --> 27:29.691
Great.

27:29.691 --> 27:30.953
You're right.

27:30.953 --> 27:33.260
I have no idea why Ben came
to you for help.

27:33.260 --> 27:35.479
But he trusts you,
so I trust you.

27:35.479 --> 27:37.090
The start of a beautiful
friendship, Jenn.

27:37.090 --> 27:39.135
Well, then let's be honest.

27:39.135 --> 27:41.094
This isn't about Addison,
not for you.

27:41.094 --> 27:43.270
You don't even know her.

27:43.270 --> 27:45.228
So why are you risking
your freedom to help Ben?

27:45.228 --> 27:47.840
You think I'm obsessed
with my dad's work?

27:47.840 --> 27:49.624
You still wear his ring.

27:49.624 --> 27:51.234
He was a hero,

27:51.234 --> 27:54.934
using QL technology
to save countless lives,

27:54.934 --> 27:58.589
while making some pretty
questionable fashion choices.

27:58.589 --> 28:00.461
I think you're trying
to save lives too.

28:00.461 --> 28:02.637
But if you really want
to honor your father's legacy,

28:02.637 --> 28:06.641
just remember,
he didn't do it alone.

28:06.641 --> 28:09.731
My dad had people
he could trust at Quantum Leap.

28:09.731 --> 28:11.211
Do you?

28:11.211 --> 28:14.127
Because Ben sure didn't
seem to think so.

28:14.127 --> 28:16.477
Sorry, I can't let you leave.

28:16.477 --> 28:19.698
Oh, these are my bodyguards.

28:19.698 --> 28:22.004
They like me.
I pay them well.

28:26.008 --> 28:27.793
Uncle Sam pays better.

28:40.370 --> 28:41.545
You didn't sleep all night?

28:41.545 --> 28:43.330
Yeah, no, I think
I drank every single

28:43.330 --> 28:44.461
cup of coffee in this hotel.

28:57.344 --> 28:59.041
It's Jamie.

28:59.041 --> 29:01.348
You ready?

29:01.348 --> 29:02.784
What do I say?

29:02.784 --> 29:08.007
Um, well,
tell her that you're sorry,

29:08.007 --> 29:10.574
that you made a choice

29:10.574 --> 29:14.578
and that you've been
paying for it ever since.

29:26.416 --> 29:27.766
Hi, Carly.

29:29.245 --> 29:30.812
Hi.

29:34.250 --> 29:35.817
I, um...

29:37.906 --> 29:39.908
Uh, you remember Jack.

29:39.908 --> 29:41.780
Yeah, we met.

29:44.043 --> 29:46.436
I don't have to stay long.

29:46.436 --> 29:49.831
I just wanted to say this
in person.

29:52.747 --> 29:54.575
I'm sorry.

29:55.968 --> 29:58.753
I know I made myself sick
for a long time.

29:58.753 --> 30:00.233
And I know you tried
to help me.

30:00.233 --> 30:04.193
But I--I lost everything.

30:04.193 --> 30:06.979
I had to lose everything
before I could help myself.

30:22.211 --> 30:27.129
Well, Addison, we did it.

30:27.129 --> 30:30.959
Trevor is gone, and we made it
through the night.

30:30.959 --> 30:32.004
Carly is--

30:32.004 --> 30:35.268
Still going to die.

30:35.268 --> 30:37.705
- What?
- Yeah.

30:37.705 --> 30:39.576
Every time you save her life,

30:39.576 --> 30:41.665
the killer reacts
with a new plan.

30:41.665 --> 30:44.016
I mean, I'll give them this,
they are relentless.

30:44.016 --> 30:46.018
So it's not Trevor?

30:47.541 --> 30:48.629
He has motive.

30:48.629 --> 30:49.760
And he sent all the letters.

30:49.760 --> 30:52.154
Yeah, well,
he's a liar and a creep.

30:52.154 --> 30:55.288
But unless he can ninja his way
past concert security,

30:55.288 --> 30:56.506
he's not the killer,

30:56.506 --> 30:59.205
because Carly is stabbed
backstage tonight.

30:59.205 --> 31:02.338
And this time, the knife isn't
found in Jamie's hotel room.

31:02.338 --> 31:03.862
OK, well, that's a relief.

31:03.862 --> 31:06.995
It's found on Jamie,
in her coat pocket.

31:17.832 --> 31:20.052
So you want me
to cancel the show?

31:20.052 --> 31:21.880
I have reason to believe

31:21.880 --> 31:25.361
that there's going to be
another attempt tonight.

31:25.361 --> 31:28.756
But you don't know
who is trying to kill her?

31:28.756 --> 31:29.931
Not yet.

31:29.931 --> 31:30.932
It could be anybody.

31:30.932 --> 31:32.412
Then Jack's right.

31:32.412 --> 31:34.936
You can't take the risk.

31:34.936 --> 31:35.937
I just got you back.

31:35.937 --> 31:38.374
I can't lose you again.

31:38.374 --> 31:40.681
Whoever is doing this,

31:40.681 --> 31:44.250
they've already failed twice,
but they just keep trying.

31:44.250 --> 31:46.861
I mean, what am I gonna do,
just keep running away forever?

31:49.733 --> 31:52.127
What did you say, Jack?
You said,

31:52.127 --> 31:54.913
"Don't waste even a minute
being afraid"?

31:58.394 --> 32:01.136
Well, I don't want
to live in fear,

32:01.136 --> 32:04.444
always wondering
about what's gonna happen.

32:04.444 --> 32:08.709
Besides... it's a chance
to catch the killer.

32:08.709 --> 32:10.450
You're gonna use yourself
as bait?

32:10.450 --> 32:12.800
I want this to end.

32:12.800 --> 32:14.497
So I'm gonna go up
on that stage,

32:14.497 --> 32:17.065
and I'm gonna trust

32:17.065 --> 32:20.416
that the people I love
are gonna stop him.

32:22.114 --> 32:23.637
What do you say, Jack?

32:41.002 --> 32:45.093
<i>♪ Whoa, Black Betty,
bam-ba-lam ♪</i>

32:45.093 --> 32:47.139
<i>♪ She really gets me high,
bam-ba-lam ♪</i>

32:47.139 --> 32:49.315
<i>♪ You know that's no lie,
bam-ba-lam ♪</i>

32:49.315 --> 32:51.360
<i>♪ She's so rock steady,
bam-ba-lam ♪</i>

32:51.360 --> 32:56.017
<i>♪ Whoa, Black Betty,
bam-ba-lam ♪</i>

32:57.366 --> 32:58.498
When do you want me
to open the house?

32:58.498 --> 33:00.152
Not until
Ms. Farmer is backstage.

33:00.152 --> 33:04.286
No one gets in
without a... pass.

33:04.286 --> 33:05.940
- Hey, Jack.
- Hi.

33:09.900 --> 33:12.338
Oh, I'm so relieved--
that you're here.

33:12.338 --> 33:14.340
I'm so relieved
that you're here.

33:14.340 --> 33:15.863
Mm.

33:21.869 --> 33:23.131
- No knife?
- No.

33:23.131 --> 33:24.611
The killer must
plant it on her.

33:24.611 --> 33:27.048
Well, Ziggy says that
Trevor's still at the hotel.

33:27.048 --> 33:29.050
Ah, so he's really
not the killer.

33:29.050 --> 33:32.053
But then why would he invite
Jamie to Chicago?

33:32.053 --> 33:33.402
The invitation, remember?

33:33.402 --> 33:35.535
It--it looked like all
of his other letters.

33:36.536 --> 33:37.450
What is that?

33:39.104 --> 33:41.628
Only he was surprised
when he saw the invitation

33:41.628 --> 33:43.499
because he didn't know
anything about it.

33:44.283 --> 33:46.502
You should have shown me this
right when you got it.

33:51.246 --> 33:53.118
Stay where I can see you.

33:53.118 --> 33:55.946
I need the number
for the Drake Hotel

33:55.946 --> 33:57.687
and a dime.

34:05.391 --> 34:06.479
Hello?

34:06.479 --> 34:08.089
Trevor, don't hang up.

34:08.089 --> 34:09.438
Someone is about to kill Carly.

34:09.438 --> 34:10.744
Jack?

34:10.744 --> 34:13.529
God, you really are unhinged,
you know that?

34:13.529 --> 34:15.096
I know you didn't
invite Jamie to the show,

34:15.096 --> 34:16.402
but someone else did,
someone who knew

34:16.402 --> 34:17.533
about the letters
you were sending,

34:17.533 --> 34:19.100
and that someone is about
to kill her.

34:23.713 --> 34:24.932
Who opened the house?

34:24.932 --> 34:26.629
Carly! Oh, my God!

34:26.629 --> 34:29.937
Ms. Farmer, we need
to get you backstage right now.

34:29.937 --> 34:32.331
Carly, wait!

34:32.331 --> 34:35.856
Trevor, who else knew about
the letters you were sending?

34:37.118 --> 34:39.773
She was always jealous
of Carly,

34:39.773 --> 34:41.253
then she was mad

34:41.253 --> 34:42.993
about her cutting me
out of the songwriting.

34:42.993 --> 34:44.517
Who?
Who are you talking about?

34:44.517 --> 34:45.953
Loretta.

34:45.953 --> 34:48.129
We've been seeing each other
on and off for a year.

34:48.129 --> 34:49.391
Carly's backup singer.

34:49.391 --> 34:50.827
She has enough
to worry about already,

34:50.827 --> 34:53.265
and you want to tell her,
her junkie sister is here?

34:53.265 --> 34:55.484
Ben, you need to go.

34:55.484 --> 34:57.225
Security!
Out of the way!

34:57.225 --> 34:58.792
Excuse me! Security!

35:03.057 --> 35:05.364
Where is Jack?

35:05.364 --> 35:07.148
Anybody have eyes
on Ms. Farmer's bodyguard?

35:07.148 --> 35:09.890
Carly,
Jamie needs to see you.

35:09.890 --> 35:12.414
You go to your sister.
I'll find Jack, Ms. Farmer.

35:12.414 --> 35:13.589
Thank you.

35:15.852 --> 35:17.158
Jamie?

35:18.812 --> 35:25.514
Carly!

35:30.911 --> 35:32.086
Jamie?

35:35.307 --> 35:37.700
Loretta, please, no!

35:38.875 --> 35:41.051
Ah!

35:41.051 --> 35:43.184
Someone send help!
She has a knife!

35:43.184 --> 35:45.186
It should've been me
on that stage.

35:45.186 --> 35:46.622
You don't deserve Trevor.

35:46.622 --> 35:49.234
You don't deserve anything--
anything.

35:49.234 --> 35:52.237
I need police and EMTs
on site now.

35:52.237 --> 35:53.629
<i>Copy that.</i>

35:55.675 --> 35:57.764
- Jack.
- Ben!

35:57.764 --> 35:58.808
Are you OK?

35:58.808 --> 36:00.680
I've never been stabbed.

36:00.680 --> 36:02.725
It really hurts.
Oh, God.

36:02.725 --> 36:05.075
Aah!
- We need paramedics over here!

36:05.075 --> 36:07.600
Ben, focus on me.

36:07.600 --> 36:09.254
You were right.

36:09.254 --> 36:11.212
We're better as a team.

36:11.212 --> 36:13.432
Yes, we are.

36:15.477 --> 36:17.697
OK.
Let me see, let me see.

36:20.526 --> 36:22.223
OK.

36:22.223 --> 36:24.356
You're gonna be OK.

36:24.356 --> 36:26.271
You're gonna be OK, Ben.

36:38.805 --> 36:42.374
Let me guess,
you used Ziggy to find me.

36:42.374 --> 36:44.289
Well, I'm not at liberty
to say that

36:44.289 --> 36:46.943
that's exactly what I did.

36:46.943 --> 36:49.163
Magic. Mom says hi.

36:49.163 --> 36:50.730
We have a lot
to talk about, Janis.

36:50.730 --> 36:53.689
Yeah, what if I don't
feel like talking?

36:53.689 --> 36:55.778
You're not exactly
the waterboarding type.

36:55.778 --> 36:57.258
Maybe not.

36:57.258 --> 37:00.043
But I have my ways.

37:06.485 --> 37:10.489
Must feel good
finally bringing her in.

37:10.489 --> 37:14.057
Ask me after we've heard
what she has to say.

37:14.057 --> 37:15.189
- It's fine.
- Are you sure

37:15.189 --> 37:17.104
you don't want to go
to the hospital?

37:17.104 --> 37:18.410
And miss your show?

37:18.410 --> 37:19.759
It's not happening.

37:19.759 --> 37:22.457
Besides, I heard you have
a new backup singer.

37:24.024 --> 37:26.113
You're really gonna
watch me embarrass myself?

37:26.113 --> 37:28.681
You're gonna be great,
both of you.

37:36.341 --> 37:39.866
So now that I'm safe,

37:39.866 --> 37:42.303
any rule against taking me
on a real date?

37:43.826 --> 37:47.961
I have a feeling my calendar
is going to be very open.

38:01.061 --> 38:04.543
Thank you, Jack,

38:04.543 --> 38:06.675
for giving me my life back.

38:06.675 --> 38:10.157
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome to the stage</i>

38:10.157 --> 38:12.812
<i>Carly Farmer!</i>

38:29.437 --> 38:33.180
Good evening, Chicago!

38:33.180 --> 38:35.661
Tonight is a very
special night.

38:35.661 --> 38:40.230
I am singing with my sister
for the first time in years.

38:40.230 --> 38:41.623
I'd like to dedicate this song

38:41.623 --> 38:44.583
to all my fellow travelers
out there.

38:51.067 --> 38:56.682
♪ Time goes by,
I live my life ♪

38:56.682 --> 39:00.686
both:
♪ Traveling down the road

39:00.686 --> 39:05.386
♪ Open my eyes to clear
blue skies, but I'm ♪

39:05.386 --> 39:09.042
both: ♪ Feeling all alone

39:09.042 --> 39:15.527
♪ A one-way ticket,
that's the price you pay ♪

39:15.527 --> 39:19.139
♪ Another day, another song

39:19.139 --> 39:28.583
♪ Traveling on

39:30.498 --> 39:34.459
♪ But I'm making my way
back home ♪

39:35.677 --> 39:38.898
♪ All these spaces
look the same ♪

39:38.898 --> 39:41.335
If you say Carly's gonna die
one more time,

39:41.335 --> 39:43.511
I might just pass out.

39:44.991 --> 39:46.819
Ben.

39:49.038 --> 39:51.258
Oh, come on, that's not OK.

39:51.258 --> 39:53.086
I couldn't resist.

39:53.086 --> 39:54.696
- Ah, ah, ah.
- Mm.

39:54.696 --> 39:56.959
- Stitches.
- Mm-hmm.

39:56.959 --> 39:59.919
No, it's all good news.

39:59.919 --> 40:03.575
Carly continues to tour
and record with her sister.

40:03.575 --> 40:06.273
Jamie stays clean and sober,

40:06.273 --> 40:09.319
and Jack makes a full recovery.

40:09.319 --> 40:11.539
You put things right, Ben.

40:11.539 --> 40:12.801
You're gonna leap.

40:17.458 --> 40:19.547
I don't know why
I did this to us, Addison.

40:19.547 --> 40:21.941
I still can't remember.

40:21.941 --> 40:24.596
But I won't do it again.

40:24.596 --> 40:28.469
From now on,
we face everything together.

40:30.166 --> 40:31.994
I'm gonna hold you to that.

40:31.994 --> 40:36.303
♪ I'm making my way
back home ♪

40:36.303 --> 40:41.351
♪ Making my way back home

40:50.230 --> 40:52.275
Oh, God. Oh.

40:52.275 --> 40:53.799
Right this way, Doc, hurry!

40:53.799 --> 40:56.366
Ugh, where the hell
is Dr. Goldman?

40:56.366 --> 40:58.151
Uh, I'm--I'm calling her
right now.

41:00.545 --> 41:02.634
God, this baby is not due
for another month.

41:02.634 --> 41:04.157
Why is this happening?

41:04.157 --> 41:05.811
That's an excellent question,

41:05.811 --> 41:08.291
which I'm sure
Dr. Goldman can answer.

41:08.291 --> 41:09.467
I just got
her answering service.

41:09.467 --> 41:10.511
They don't know where she is.

41:10.511 --> 41:11.730
Who's gonna deliver our baby?

41:11.730 --> 41:13.993
She is.
Right, Doc?

41:13.993 --> 41:15.211
- Me?
- Whoa.

41:15.211 --> 41:16.430
- OK.
- You got this. Come on.
