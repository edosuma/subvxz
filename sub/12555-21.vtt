16:21.647 --> 16:24.605
IT'S VERY ODD, BUT,

16:24.692 --> 16:26.353
I'VE BEEN REMEMBERING.

16:26.444 --> 16:29.061
REMEMBERING WHAT?

16:31.407 --> 16:38.245
ABOUT SOMETHING I READ OR
HEARD ABOUT A LONG TIME AGO.

16:42.335 --> 16:46.704
ABOUT DIFFERENT
PLANES OF EXISTENCE.

16:46.797 --> 16:50.415
ABOUT TWO
PARALLEL WORLDS

16:50.510 --> 16:53.593
THAT EXIST
SIDE BY SIDE

16:55.765 --> 16:59.474
AND EACH OF US
HAS A COUNTERPART

16:59.560 --> 17:01.096
IN THIS WORLD

17:01.187 --> 17:04.805
AND, AND SOMETIMES
THROUGH SOME FREAK

17:04.898 --> 17:07.560
THROUGH SOMETHING
UNEXPLAINABLE

17:07.652 --> 17:09.142
THIS COUNTERPART--

17:09.237 --> 17:11.773
AFTER THE TWO
WORLDS CONVERGE--

17:11.864 --> 17:13.480
COMES INTO OUR WORLD

17:13.574 --> 17:15.156
AND IN ORDER
TO SURVIVE

17:15.242 --> 17:17.780
IT HAS TO TAKE OVER.

17:17.869 --> 17:20.077
TAKE OVER?

17:21.415 --> 17:23.122
REPLACE US.

17:23.209 --> 17:27.328
MOVE US OUT
SO THAT IT CAN LIVE.

17:27.421 --> 17:30.789
THAT'S A LITTLE
METAPHYSICAL FOR ME.

17:30.841 --> 17:35.631
I REMEMBER
READING IT SOMEWHERE.

17:35.721 --> 17:40.386
EACH OF US HAS A TWIN
IN THIS OTHER WORLD,

17:40.476 --> 17:44.140
AN IDENTICAL TWIN.

17:44.230 --> 17:47.063

17:47.149 --> 17:50.232
MILLICENT, THERE'S
ANOTHER EXPLANATION.

17:50.319 --> 17:51.696
THERE HAS TO BE.

17:51.779 --> 17:56.148
ONE THAT COMES
WITH MORE REASON.

17:56.242 --> 17:59.109
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT

17:59.203 --> 18:02.992
BUT I KNOW
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED.

18:03.082 --> 18:07.451
THIS OTHER WOMAN,
MY COUNTERPART--

18:07.545 --> 18:09.752
FORGET ABOUT IT, PLEASE.

18:09.839 --> 18:14.834
DON'T THINK ABOUT IT.

18:14.927 --> 18:17.339

18:21.559 --> 18:24.051
MAYBE HE'LL BRING HIS
CAR DOWN HERE FOR US.

18:24.145 --> 18:26.512
HE MIGHT EVEN
DRIVE US INTO SYRACUSE.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.392
I'LL CALL HIM.

18:32.403 --> 18:35.987
ALL RIGHT, MILLICENT?
SHALL I CALL MY FRIEND?

18:52.632 --> 18:54.589
UNASKED, I'LL TELL
YOU WHAT I THINK.

18:54.675 --> 18:57.167

KIND OF GIVES ME THE WILLIES.
