00:00.876 --> 00:02.001
Previously on Grimm...

00:02.085 --> 00:04.008
They grabbed Trubel. I tried
to stop 'em, they drugged me.

00:04.086 --> 00:05.304
Who?
Chavez.

00:05.547 --> 00:07.675
Where did he take her? Where is she?

00:07.758 --> 00:10.056
So, lam thinking
of selling the house.

00:10.135 --> 00:11.933
Find us someplace safer.

00:12.262 --> 00:14.560
It's a little barren,
but I got us enough to start.

00:14.806 --> 00:16.604
I don't want anybody
to know where we are.

00:29.279 --> 00:31.327
I fed you, I changed
you, I burped you.

00:31.448 --> 00:33.951
Why are you doing this?
What's wrong?

00:34.034 --> 00:35.035
Is the water boiling?

00:35.118 --> 00:37.496
If it's boiling, you gotta put the
rice in and then turn it down.

00:37.579 --> 00:39.673
The rice is in. How do
we turn the baby down?

00:39.790 --> 00:44.717
Oh, why don't you try? Let me deal with
the rice. It's okay, Kelly. It's okay.

00:45.796 --> 00:47.298
Nothing can be that bad.

00:49.132 --> 00:51.385
Maybe he has colic. How do
you know if he has colic?

00:51.468 --> 00:54.972
I don't know. I'm still learning to
boil rice. Should we call Rosalee?

00:55.264 --> 00:56.311
Okay, then
you take Kelly.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.142
Ah, ha! Never mind,
I'll call her.

01:03.480 --> 01:04.697
Hear the cello counterpoint?

01:04.940 --> 01:06.783
I hear the cello.

01:06.858 --> 01:09.657
Whether it's counterpointing
or not, I couldn't tell you.

01:09.903 --> 01:13.282
Oh, best part of the day.
More wine?

01:13.365 --> 01:14.366
Absolutely.

01:21.290 --> 01:22.370
I don't wanna know.

01:27.045 --> 01:28.297
Adalind, is everything okay?

01:28.380 --> 01:31.600
We've tried everything. He's been
bathed, changed, burped, pooped,

01:31.675 --> 01:33.928
and he won't stop crying.
How do we know if it's colic?

01:34.177 --> 01:36.225
Pretty much
if he won't stop crying.

01:36.305 --> 01:38.433
Okay, then what do
we do about it?

01:38.515 --> 01:41.314
Fennel sometimes helps,
nothing works all the time.

01:41.393 --> 01:42.519
I don't care
about all the time,

01:42.603 --> 01:45.026
I just care about
right now. He...

01:46.982 --> 01:50.657
What just happened? He's looking
at the lights on the phone.

01:50.777 --> 01:52.029
Oh! The rice is boiling over.
Oh! Uh...

01:52.112 --> 01:53.284
Sorry, Rosalee,
gotta go.

01:54.197 --> 01:55.198
Okay.

01:56.450 --> 01:57.497
That solved itself.

02:01.038 --> 02:03.507
You like the phone,
don't you, buddy, huh?

02:03.582 --> 02:05.142
I think we should
get him his own phone.

02:06.376 --> 02:07.377
Not till second grade.

02:09.045 --> 02:11.845
Tradition is our lifeblood.

02:13.383 --> 02:16.307
Loyalty, trust and honor.

02:16.887 --> 02:19.731
Without these virtues,
family cannot survive.

02:20.182 --> 02:23.061
But it is our traditions
that hold us together.

02:24.645 --> 02:28.900
And no tradition is more important
than our Maagd Zoektocht.

02:29.107 --> 02:33.487
My son's blood calls to me from the grave.
He was taken from me.

02:34.613 --> 02:38.163
And when a man does not have
a son to inherit his legacy,

02:38.241 --> 02:40.335
he must turn to tradition.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.290
My daughter Emily
is all I have left.

02:46.249 --> 02:49.128
Our Maagd Zoektocht
requires one of you

02:49.211 --> 02:54.058
to prove your worthiness
to win her heart and her hand.

02:56.885 --> 02:58.683
Let the Griffin choose.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.585
Isaac has drawn
the longest feather.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.464
He will have the first chance
to prove himself.

03:30.544 --> 03:31.591
What is my quest?

03:32.087 --> 03:35.136
To kill the man responsible
for my son's death.

03:38.677 --> 03:41.772
Bring me the head
of Frankie Adkins.

03:42.639 --> 03:43.686
I will.

03:49.020 --> 03:53.321
Emily, I've loved you
for years.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.698
Now I finally
get to prove it.

03:55.777 --> 03:57.324
You'll make
a beautiful bride.

04:12.836 --> 04:14.338
This is good.
Really?

04:15.589 --> 04:17.887
I haven't done
much cooking.

04:17.966 --> 04:20.435
My mom wasn't always around,
so I kind of taught myself.

04:20.510 --> 04:22.057
A kid can only
eat so much pizza.

04:22.179 --> 04:24.477
I know plenty
of kids who would disagree.

04:25.348 --> 04:26.816
This is good.

04:29.895 --> 04:31.693
I bet your mom
was a good cook.

04:32.189 --> 04:34.487
Till I was about 12
and then she,

04:34.566 --> 04:36.113
sort of, disappeared.

04:36.568 --> 04:38.320
Hey, it's, kind of,
like my dad.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.030
He took off
when I was four.

04:43.700 --> 04:48.297
Look, I know our arrangement is
weird and I've said this before,

04:48.371 --> 04:51.170
but I really appreciate
you taking care of us.

04:52.501 --> 04:53.593
He's my son, too.

04:53.668 --> 04:56.091
I know, but I don't like
having to rely on you.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.966
Not just you, I don't like
having to rely on anybody.

04:59.049 --> 05:01.347
You've been great, but...

05:03.929 --> 05:06.557
I, uh, ran into an old colleague
at the grocery store.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.316
From your law firm?
Mmm-hmm.

05:08.558 --> 05:11.482
He said they're understaffed.
There's possibility of a job.

05:12.854 --> 05:14.494
Isn't it a little soon
to go back to work?

05:14.856 --> 05:16.699
Yeah, it is.

05:16.775 --> 05:19.324
It just made me
feel better knowing

05:19.402 --> 05:21.404
that there was
a job out there.

05:22.489 --> 05:23.706
I need to contribute, Nick.

05:23.782 --> 05:26.080
I don't like
feeling so helpless.

05:27.244 --> 05:31.124
That being said, I'd like you to stay
with us in our room again tonight.

05:33.291 --> 05:35.293
It's just I sleep
a lot better knowing

05:35.377 --> 05:38.130
that you'll kill whatever
walks through that door.

06:11.079 --> 06:13.628
Here you go, birthday girl.
Happy birthday.

06:13.707 --> 06:16.051
Oh, Frankie's
the best, right?

06:25.552 --> 06:26.974
Let's get
out of here.

06:35.979 --> 06:37.322
Go get the car.

06:40.692 --> 06:42.092
Can we go somewhere
and get burgers?

06:42.152 --> 06:43.620
No.
Why not?

06:43.695 --> 06:45.197
'Cause you're putting on
too much weight.

06:45.280 --> 06:46.281
What?

07:05.508 --> 07:06.976
Frankie! Oh, my God!

07:07.052 --> 07:09.475
What the hell?
Who are you?

07:12.015 --> 07:13.015
No!

07:51.096 --> 07:53.349
Sean, thank you so much for coming.
Of course.

07:53.723 --> 07:54.724
It's good to see you.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.651
- It's been a while.
- It has.

07:56.726 --> 07:59.195
Although I've seen your face
all over the news recently.

07:59.270 --> 08:01.190
Well, hopefully you'll see
more of it.

08:03.066 --> 08:04.346
We wanted to ask you...

08:04.609 --> 08:07.954
Well, we think the time
is right for Andrew.

08:08.571 --> 08:10.619
He's gonna announce that he's
running for mayor of Portland.

08:10.782 --> 08:12.659
With sights on the
governorship, of course.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.169
One election at a time.

08:16.287 --> 08:18.167
He's becoming quite a force
to be reckoned with.

08:18.373 --> 08:19.670
It's good to hear you
say that.

08:19.749 --> 08:20.921
I'd really like
your support.

08:21.292 --> 08:22.669
You really think
I mean something?

08:22.752 --> 08:26.177
You're a widely respected figure
of authority here in Portland,

08:26.256 --> 08:27.936
and we think you could
do us a lot of good.

08:28.925 --> 08:30.177
Listen, before I agree
to anything,

08:30.260 --> 08:32.808
I need to know a little more
about what you plan to do if...

08:32.886 --> 08:34.855
Uh-uh. When.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.356
If you get elected.

08:39.436 --> 08:41.029
Well, nobody gets
elected without confidence

08:41.104 --> 08:42.344
or the right people
backing him.

08:46.359 --> 08:49.238
Assault happened sometime after
they closed, little after 2:00.

08:49.320 --> 08:52.369
Bodyguard, Luis Lopez,
was hit first.

08:52.449 --> 08:54.793
Frankie Adkins, he's the owner
of the bar, he was hit next.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.212
We ID'd the body
as Isaac Proctor.

08:57.287 --> 08:59.381
"Proctor." Name's familiar.

08:59.456 --> 09:02.756
Isaac is the son of criminal
defense attorney, Amanda Proctor.

09:02.834 --> 09:03.835
I've dealt with her.

09:03.918 --> 09:05.795
She's kept a lot of
bad people on the street.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.799
So someone kills her son? Someone
trying to send a message?

09:09.299 --> 09:11.393
If they are, it's a pretty
brutal candy gram.

09:11.468 --> 09:13.641
Sword?
Pretty old school.

09:14.846 --> 09:15.972
- Any witnesses?
- Yeah.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.856
Frankie Adkins and his girlfriend, Lola.
She took off after he was hit.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.061
Paramedics took care
of Frankie,

09:21.144 --> 09:23.112
who told them he was
attacked by Isaac.

09:23.188 --> 09:24.188
Our victim.

09:24.272 --> 09:26.115
- So Frankie killed Isaac?
- Nope.

09:26.191 --> 09:28.364
According to Frankie,
Isaac was killed

09:28.443 --> 09:31.117
by a guy wearing a weird
looking animal outfit.

09:31.237 --> 09:32.637
I didn't press him.

09:32.697 --> 09:34.574
I leave
the pressing to you.

09:34.657 --> 09:35.737
Where's the girlfriend now?

09:35.742 --> 09:37.585
At home. She was
too scared to stick around.

09:37.660 --> 09:40.539
She made the 911 call from a
burger joint down the street.

09:40.622 --> 09:41.794
Let's talk to Frankie.

09:41.873 --> 09:42.920
Inside.

09:42.999 --> 09:44.000
Thank you.

09:54.177 --> 09:55.679
Frank Adkins.
Yeah.

09:56.429 --> 09:59.273
I'm Detective Griffin,
this is Detective Burkhardt.

09:59.349 --> 10:00.396
You wanna tell us
what happened?

10:00.475 --> 10:01.852
Yeah, I do.

10:02.685 --> 10:04.403
I was leaving
with Luis and Lola.

10:04.479 --> 10:06.197
Luis goes to get the car.

10:06.272 --> 10:07.945
Me and Lola were
just getting in,

10:08.024 --> 10:09.617
then some guy
sucker punches me.

10:09.692 --> 10:11.444
I go down.
When I look up,

10:11.528 --> 10:15.249
he's got a freaking sword
about to cut my head off.

10:15.490 --> 10:16.992
Had you ever seen him before?
No.

10:17.325 --> 10:18.793
And just when I thought
I was dead,

10:18.868 --> 10:23.544
he gets taken out by some guy wearing
some kind of animal costume.

10:23.623 --> 10:24.715
What did you
do then?

10:24.791 --> 10:26.088
You kidding me?
I hid under the car.

10:26.167 --> 10:27.339
The guy was
tearing him to pieces.

10:27.418 --> 10:28.498
How long did you
stay there?

10:28.586 --> 10:30.429
Till the cops came.
I'm not stupid.

10:36.219 --> 10:38.392
It was like a nightmare.

10:38.471 --> 10:41.270
I mean, I never seen
anything like this before.

10:41.349 --> 10:42.396
I don't know
what was going on,

10:42.475 --> 10:45.069
but whoever killed that son
of a bitch, he saved my life.

10:45.562 --> 10:46.722
The guy in
the animal costume?

10:46.729 --> 10:48.572
Yeah. Him.

10:50.066 --> 10:51.534
I owe him big time.

10:54.737 --> 10:56.364
Isaac Proctor was
arrested five years ago

10:56.447 --> 10:59.075
for aggravated assaults
and some misdemeanors, too.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.661
Frankie is no
choirboy either.

11:00.743 --> 11:02.996
What is the connection
between Isaac and Frankie?

11:03.079 --> 11:04.126
Well, there's none
that I can see.

11:04.372 --> 11:05.589
Hey, what about
the bodyguard?

11:05.832 --> 11:07.334
He's got a rap sheet,
but was he was unconscious

11:07.417 --> 11:08.669
at the time
Isaac was killed.

11:08.751 --> 11:10.711
Plus, it would have been
self-defense, either way.

11:10.962 --> 11:13.056
All right, so why was Isaac
trying to kill Frankie?

11:13.423 --> 11:15.676
Frankie must've done
something to Isaac.

11:15.758 --> 11:17.305
Maybe Isaac's mother
would know.

11:17.385 --> 11:19.865
A criminal defense attorney
probably knows what the problem is.

11:19.888 --> 11:21.390
I think the Captain
knows her.

11:21.472 --> 11:22.552
Well, let's run it
past him.

11:23.933 --> 11:26.402
If Frankie is telling the
truth, someone else was there

11:26.477 --> 11:28.980
when Isaac knocked him down. And
that person took out Isaac.

11:29.314 --> 11:31.988
And Frankie described this mystery
man as wearing an animal outfit?

11:32.108 --> 11:33.826
We're assuming
that guy was Wesen.

11:33.902 --> 11:35.279
Isaac Proctor is, too.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.159
I know his mother Amanda.

11:37.238 --> 11:39.491
She's a good lawyer
but keeps bad company.

11:39.574 --> 11:42.623
They're Weten Ogen.
Not my favorite.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.376
So Isaac is Wesen,
whoever killed him is Wesen.

11:45.455 --> 11:46.502
What about Frankie?

11:46.664 --> 11:49.133
I don't know. Have you
told Amanda Proctor yet?

11:49.792 --> 11:51.089
We wanted to do
background first.

11:51.169 --> 11:52.449
I should go with you
on this one.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.637
You know, Kelly,
you're not an only child.

11:58.635 --> 12:02.139
You have a big sister.
Her name is Diana.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.563
I hope we can all be
together someday.

12:08.144 --> 12:10.738
I haven't seen her
in a really long time.

12:21.699 --> 12:22.746
Rosalee?

12:22.825 --> 12:24.873
Just checking in.
How's Kelly?

12:24.994 --> 12:27.292
Oh, he's good,
when he's sleeping.

12:27.372 --> 12:30.091
I put together a few things
for you and the little guy.

12:30.166 --> 12:32.294
I can come by and drop them
off if you're not busy.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.466
Oh, no, no, no.
We should come to you.

12:34.671 --> 12:36.173
Are you sure?
Yeah.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.099
I think I'm getting
a little fortress fever.

12:38.383 --> 12:40.226
Okay,
I'm just here at the shop.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.394
Okay. We are on our way.

12:43.721 --> 12:45.815
Isaac was a good boy,

12:45.890 --> 12:47.517
he believed
in the tradition,

12:48.434 --> 12:50.027
and he will be mourned.

12:51.187 --> 12:53.781
But his mistake
is your opportunity.

12:55.316 --> 12:58.195
Isaac almost succeeded
at his task

12:58.319 --> 13:01.573
but failed at the last moment
when he was attacked.

13:01.698 --> 13:04.247
Now, I don't know
which one of you did it,

13:04.325 --> 13:07.875
but if I were you, I would not
turn my back on the other.

13:08.663 --> 13:10.711
Eli, it's your turn now.

13:11.416 --> 13:13.965
But Frankie Adkins knows
someone has tried to kill him,

13:14.043 --> 13:16.216
and it's going to make it
that much harder on you.

13:16.879 --> 13:18.256
Good luck.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.476
But first,
we drink to Isaac,

13:22.260 --> 13:24.763
a brave and noble
Weten Ogen.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.557
To a brave
and noble Weten Ogen.

13:28.349 --> 13:30.192
Who should've
watched his back.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.490
You.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.783
Eli!
Emily.

13:45.616 --> 13:47.994
You don't have to do this.
This tradition isn't worth it.

13:48.703 --> 13:49.829
Maybe not, but you are.

13:50.580 --> 13:51.627
Isaac was killed.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.583
What happened to Isaac is
not gonna happen to me.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.384
I've got a way in.

13:55.460 --> 13:57.508
How can you be sure,
unless you killed Isaac?

13:57.587 --> 13:58.839
I didn't kill Isaac.

13:58.921 --> 14:01.015
But I knew he wouldn't
be able to kill Frankie.

14:01.090 --> 14:03.343
If Amos gets in my way,
I will kill him.

14:04.260 --> 14:06.183
Please don't do this.
Don't go back to the club.

14:06.262 --> 14:08.105
I'm not gonna make
the same mistake as Isaac.

14:08.765 --> 14:10.813
He'll have more bodyguards. Shh.

14:11.684 --> 14:14.654
Don't worry, babe.
This is our time.

14:14.729 --> 14:17.903
You and me are gonna bring
two great families together.

14:17.982 --> 14:21.077
And you and me are gonna make
a big family, lots of kids.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.784
You just worry about
how to raise them.

14:24.447 --> 14:26.415
Okay?

14:29.744 --> 14:31.997
I'll be fine.
I'll see you later.

14:33.790 --> 14:34.962
Do you have
any idea why your son

14:35.041 --> 14:36.384
would try to kill
Frankie Adkins?

14:36.584 --> 14:39.633
No. As far as I know
he didn't even know him.

14:39.796 --> 14:40.968
We know, Isaac
had a record.

14:41.089 --> 14:43.968
I know my son had problems,

14:44.967 --> 14:47.367
but I just can't believe that
he'd do what you're suggesting.

14:47.637 --> 14:49.059
Did Isaac associate
with anyone

14:49.138 --> 14:50.618
who might have had it
out for Frankie?

14:50.640 --> 14:54.520
My son's the one who is dead. Shouldn't
you be asking who killed him?

14:54.602 --> 14:56.070
Amanda, if you want us
to find the person

14:56.145 --> 14:57.567
responsible for
your son's death,

14:57.647 --> 14:59.069
then you need
to talk to us.

14:59.148 --> 15:02.197
How do you know Frankie didn't kill my son?
Frankie has a record, too.

15:02.318 --> 15:03.695
We know Frankie
isn't Wesen.

15:04.362 --> 15:05.363
What?

15:06.906 --> 15:08.374
Detective Burkhardt
is a Grimm.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.753
And you brought him
into my office?

15:13.413 --> 15:14.915
He knows that
Isaac was Wesen.

15:18.334 --> 15:20.462
Is this what you
wanted to see, Grimm?

15:21.295 --> 15:23.055
I'm trying to figure out
who killed your son.

15:26.008 --> 15:29.137
You know, I knew
you had one working for you.

15:29.220 --> 15:31.188
I just hoped that
I'd never have to see him.

15:31.681 --> 15:33.900
We think whoever killed your
son might also be Wesen.

15:36.644 --> 15:39.363
Do you know where your son was
before he went to Frankie's club?

15:39.522 --> 15:44.449
He was invited to Daniel Troyer's house.
I would assume for dinner.

15:44.527 --> 15:45.870
Is Daniel Troyer Wesen?

15:46.821 --> 15:48.869
Weten Ogen, like me.

15:50.658 --> 15:52.205
What do we know
about Daniel Troyer?

15:52.285 --> 15:53.582
He's been in Portland
for quite a while.

15:53.661 --> 15:55.413
I know he was
investigated by the FBI.

15:55.496 --> 15:57.794
He has some connections to a few
crime families on the east coast.

15:57.874 --> 15:59.000
Well, Isaac tried
to kill Frankie

15:59.083 --> 16:00.551
the same night
he was at Troyer's house.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.026
Maybe Frankie's
connected to Troyer.

16:02.044 --> 16:03.546
Push Troyer,
see what you get.

16:05.298 --> 16:10.850
Electric bill, telephone bill,
advertising... Oh, we won $1 million.

16:11.220 --> 16:12.392
Yipee.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.399
All right, I gotta get to this repair.
I'm gonna be late.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.318
Should
only take about an hour.

16:19.061 --> 16:20.062
What is that?

16:20.605 --> 16:22.983
I'm not sure. It's from
a guy I used to know

16:23.065 --> 16:24.738
a long time ago
in Seattle.

16:27.361 --> 16:28.408
You wanna open it?

16:28.654 --> 16:29.906
I'm not sure.

16:30.364 --> 16:31.411
You want me to open it?

16:32.742 --> 16:33.789
I'm not sure.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.877
You know what?
Maybe I shouldn't hear this.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.426
There's nothing
you shouldn't hear.

16:49.300 --> 16:50.347
"Dear R,

16:50.426 --> 16:53.726
"Don't know if you're ever going to
get this, but I'm gonna try anyway.

16:53.804 --> 16:56.057
"Just want to let you
know that Carlos died.

16:57.475 --> 17:01.355
"You can guess of what. He was a
cool guy, and I'm going to miss him.

17:01.437 --> 17:04.031
"Don't know what your feeling
is about him these days,

17:04.607 --> 17:06.734
"but he meant a lot
to you at one time.

17:06.817 --> 17:08.865
"I still remember that
song he wrote for you."

17:09.529 --> 17:10.655
There was a song?

17:13.031 --> 17:14.432
I don't wanna read
any more of that.

17:14.450 --> 17:18.296
Those are not good guys. And that
song was terrible.

17:18.788 --> 17:21.257
I'd rather just forget that
entire part of my life.

17:21.332 --> 17:22.378
Me, too.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.594
Not your life,
I mean, that part of mine.

17:26.753 --> 17:29.007
In fact everything
before I met you.

17:37.306 --> 17:40.606
Before we talk to Troyer, are
you gonna play the Wesen card?

17:41.227 --> 17:42.274
Not unless I have to.

17:42.812 --> 17:45.816
Once he knows we know, we might not
be able get anything out of him.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.442
Might not get anything
out of him anyway.

17:54.657 --> 17:56.659
I'm Detective Burkhardt,
this is Detective Griffin.

17:56.742 --> 17:58.085
We're looking
for Daniel Troyer.

17:58.703 --> 18:00.546
I'm his daughter, Emily.
He's in the backyard.

18:00.621 --> 18:01.998
Can you tell me
what this is about?

18:02.123 --> 18:03.841
We prefer to talk
to your father.

18:04.292 --> 18:06.386
Of course.
I'll take you to him.

18:11.716 --> 18:13.969
Check the inventory
again and find out

18:14.051 --> 18:16.099
who was responsible
for shipping it.

18:16.178 --> 18:17.475
Get the name.

18:17.555 --> 18:21.401
Dad, this is Detective Burkhardt and
Griffin. They need to talk to you.

18:21.475 --> 18:22.943
I've gotta go.

18:23.019 --> 18:24.521
Is there a problem,
gentlemen?

18:25.104 --> 18:26.526
Do you know
Isaac Proctor?

18:27.356 --> 18:29.779
Yes. I heard
what happened to him.

18:29.859 --> 18:32.863
It's very sad. I assume
you're investigating it.

18:32.945 --> 18:35.305
We'd like to talk to you about
your relationship with Isaac.

18:35.781 --> 18:38.751
I've known Isaac
since he was a kid.

18:38.826 --> 18:41.249
His mother has handled
some legal problems for me.

18:41.329 --> 18:43.548
Isaac and Emily
used to play together.

18:43.956 --> 18:44.957
When was the last time
you saw him?

18:45.041 --> 18:46.042
Last night.

18:46.500 --> 18:47.717
He was here with us.

18:48.419 --> 18:49.466
For what reason?

18:50.129 --> 18:51.176
He came to see me.

18:51.672 --> 18:52.969
What was your
relationship with him?

18:53.049 --> 18:54.301
He was a friend.

18:54.717 --> 18:58.722
Like my dad said, we'd known
each other since we were kids.

18:59.472 --> 19:00.519
I'm sorry.

19:00.931 --> 19:02.478
Look, this is very
difficult for her,

19:02.558 --> 19:04.026
does she have to be
a part of this?

19:04.101 --> 19:05.978
You knew the victim,
might be help to us.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.606
I'm okay.

19:08.856 --> 19:10.233
Do you know
Frankie Adkins?

19:10.608 --> 19:13.612
Frankie Adkins,
I don't know. Should I?

19:13.986 --> 19:16.910
According to Mr. Adkins, Isaac
tried to kill him last night.

19:17.239 --> 19:19.458
What? Isaac?

19:20.284 --> 19:22.912
I don't believe it.
Why would he do that?

19:22.995 --> 19:24.838
Do you know if Isaac
knew Frankie Adkins?

19:24.997 --> 19:26.044
No, I don't.

19:26.415 --> 19:27.415
Do you?

19:27.458 --> 19:29.301
No, I'm sorry,
I don't know.

19:29.835 --> 19:31.587
What time did Isaac
leave last night?

19:31.962 --> 19:33.885
Around 11:00, I think.

19:34.256 --> 19:35.856
And has anyone
threatened him in any way?

19:36.092 --> 19:37.639
Not that he ever
told me about.

19:37.927 --> 19:39.679
Did both of you stay
home after Isaac left?

19:39.762 --> 19:40.763
Yes.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.646
Was anyone else here
besides the three of you?

19:43.933 --> 19:46.732
No. It was just
Isaac and us.

19:51.107 --> 19:52.575
Nobody knows anything.

19:52.650 --> 19:54.448
Oh, this is all
connected somehow.

19:54.527 --> 19:55.767
Yeah, why would
Isaac leave here

19:55.820 --> 19:57.493
and go and try
and kill Frankie?

19:57.571 --> 19:59.611
Maybe Frankie and Isaac
are both in love with Emily.

19:59.657 --> 20:00.954
Or could be
they were jealous.

20:01.075 --> 20:02.247
Well, then
who killed Isaac?

20:02.368 --> 20:04.370
All we know is he's Wesen.

20:04.912 --> 20:08.542
Well, that's not gonna show
up on his rap sheet. It's Wu.

20:13.504 --> 20:14.551
Wu.

20:14.755 --> 20:18.305
You will never guess what the ME
found during Isaac's autopsy.

20:18.384 --> 20:22.264
A feather. And not just any old feather.
It's a golden feather.

20:22.346 --> 20:24.144
ME didn't think it had
anything to do with anything

20:24.223 --> 20:25.520
'cause the victim
wasn't hurt by it,

20:25.599 --> 20:28.648
as in"knocked
over by a feather."

20:28.728 --> 20:30.776
But not having spent time
in a mental institution,

20:30.855 --> 20:33.859
the ME does not have
the insight that I now have.

20:33.941 --> 20:35.443
What do you think
it means, Wu?

20:35.526 --> 20:37.449
I have no idea,
except we got a grown man

20:37.528 --> 20:39.528
walking around with a golden
feather in his pocket.

20:39.989 --> 20:41.582
Just thought you should know.

20:41.657 --> 20:42.658
Thank you.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.170
What do you think
it means?

20:48.205 --> 20:50.003
I think we're grasping
at feathers.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.963
I said it and I meant it.

21:01.010 --> 21:02.102
Got the new guys, boss.

21:02.511 --> 21:03.512
Bring 'em in.

21:04.472 --> 21:05.519
Get in here.

21:15.691 --> 21:18.035
Someone tried to
whack me last night.

21:19.528 --> 21:21.656
As you can see, they
weren't very successful,

21:21.739 --> 21:24.413
but I am not one to take
unnecessary risks.

21:25.534 --> 21:27.377
Are you willing
to die to protect me?

21:27.620 --> 21:28.667
Yes, sir.

21:30.581 --> 21:31.707
You?

21:31.957 --> 21:33.550
Nobody's gonna
get past me, sir.

21:45.763 --> 21:46.810
Where the hell are you?

21:52.853 --> 21:54.105
He's asleep.

21:55.564 --> 21:56.861
How was work?

21:57.358 --> 21:59.452
Wow. I sound so domestic.

22:00.569 --> 22:02.037
Work was...

22:02.446 --> 22:03.572
You don't have to tell me.

22:10.412 --> 22:13.382
He told me to keep Chavez's
phone, but he hasn't called.

22:14.041 --> 22:16.322
Why tell me to keep the phone
if they're not gonna use it?

22:20.339 --> 22:21.431
I hope Trubel's okay.

22:22.508 --> 22:23.555
Yeah, me, too.

22:39.608 --> 22:41.688
- And make sure that gets there tonight.
- Yes, sir.

22:42.403 --> 22:44.701
I don't want anything
to screw up this deal.

22:44.780 --> 22:46.953
We're out of here. Get the car.
Check the back.

22:49.785 --> 22:50.877
You're not gonna
lock up?

22:50.953 --> 22:52.705
No, I'm not gonna lock up.
Somebody else is gonna lock up.

22:52.788 --> 22:53.835
Now get the guys.

22:54.290 --> 22:55.792
Boss is leaving.

22:56.500 --> 22:58.548
Make sure everyone's
watching my back.

24:40.854 --> 24:42.652
Oh...
You need the bathroom.

24:42.731 --> 24:44.074
That's okay,
I can wait.

24:44.149 --> 24:45.446
No, you go first.

24:45.818 --> 24:48.947
Are you sure? 'Cause you
look a little dirty.

24:49.571 --> 24:52.541
Yeah, well,
you look... Wow!

24:53.492 --> 24:55.335
Did Kelly throw up on you?
Sort of.

24:56.370 --> 24:57.371
I'll be quick.

25:01.125 --> 25:02.923
That tunnel
must be filthy.

25:03.002 --> 25:04.003
Yeah.

25:04.169 --> 25:06.012
Did you find out
where it goes?

25:06.088 --> 25:09.592
Not exactly.
There was this big door,

25:10.300 --> 25:12.769
looks like it hasn't
been opened in 100 years.

25:12.845 --> 25:14.445
I'm gonna need some
tools to get it open.

25:16.348 --> 25:19.602
I just realized I forgot to
bring clothes to change into.

25:19.810 --> 25:21.437
Oh, Yeah? Well, I can
get you something.

25:21.520 --> 25:22.612
What do you need?

25:22.688 --> 25:24.941
Anything without
baby puke will be fine.

25:30.863 --> 25:33.867
Hey, buddy,
just so you know,

25:33.949 --> 25:35.496
not nice to throw up
on your mom.

25:58.223 --> 25:59.503
There wasn't much
to choose from,

25:59.558 --> 26:00.980
so I just got you
one of my shirts.

26:01.769 --> 26:02.816
Thanks.

26:07.858 --> 26:10.577
You know, you should
really buy some clothes.

26:11.153 --> 26:12.826
Use the credit card
that I got you.

26:13.363 --> 26:14.364
Oh...

26:14.990 --> 26:16.992
I feel a little
awkward doing that.

26:17.367 --> 26:19.620
Yeah, well, not having
clothes is awkward.

26:20.829 --> 26:21.876
True.

26:22.873 --> 26:24.420
Okay.

26:27.836 --> 26:29.838
Thank you. Your turn.

27:10.879 --> 27:12.677
Put the car away
and stay outside.

27:17.594 --> 27:19.847
I'm hungry, Luis.
Make me a sandwich.

27:49.001 --> 27:51.220
Boss got hungry.
Get me some pickles.

27:51.295 --> 27:52.342
Sure.

28:03.015 --> 28:07.065
I'm wracking my brains, Luis.
Who put a hit on me?

28:07.811 --> 28:11.111
The Johnny's crew,
Eleventh street...

28:13.692 --> 28:14.784
Where's Luis?

28:15.068 --> 28:17.070
Uh, said you were hungry
and you wanted sandwiches.

28:17.237 --> 28:19.831
Just put the sandwiches down.
Go get Luis.

28:19.907 --> 28:21.284
And get your ass
back outside.

28:30.542 --> 28:31.543
What the hell?

28:32.628 --> 28:33.628
No!

28:36.131 --> 28:37.974
Oh, my God,
not again.

29:00.614 --> 29:02.912
Someone tried to kill
Frankie Adkins again,

29:02.991 --> 29:04.914
with the same good luck
as the first assassin.

29:04.993 --> 29:07.587
So whoever tried to kill Frankie
here at home is our new victim?

29:07.663 --> 29:11.463
Little Deja Wu going on. Except for
this time, it was his new bodyguard.

29:11.541 --> 29:12.941
His own bodyguard
tried to kill him?

29:13.001 --> 29:14.002
That's what he says.

29:14.086 --> 29:15.633
Who tried to
kill the bodyguard?

29:15.712 --> 29:17.635
Same guy
in an animal outfit.

29:17.714 --> 29:19.933
Let me just say that Frankie
is starting to unravel.

29:20.008 --> 29:22.511
Paramedics gave him something
to calm him down.

29:22.594 --> 29:25.973
I think he might have done a little
self-medicating before that.

29:28.016 --> 29:29.859
Oh, what took
you guys so long?

29:29.935 --> 29:32.609
The same thing
happened again last night,

29:32.688 --> 29:34.235
except different.

29:34.815 --> 29:39.446
The guy was my bodyguard, and
he tried to kill me with an ax.

29:40.112 --> 29:43.207
What's with
the swords and axes?

29:43.365 --> 29:47.290
Why don't these morons realize you
can buy a gun literally anywhere?

29:47.369 --> 29:49.087
But someone saved
your life again.

29:49.496 --> 29:51.498
Oh, no, not someone,

29:51.581 --> 29:53.925
this freak who dresses
like an animal.

29:54.001 --> 29:55.093
The same one as before?

29:55.377 --> 29:56.469
Oh, yeah.

29:57.421 --> 29:59.924
You don't forget
something like this.

30:00.007 --> 30:04.057
Sharp teeth, yellow eyes,
pointed ears,

30:05.429 --> 30:07.431
lot of hair
with stripes in it.

30:07.514 --> 30:11.894
What happens once this
"animal" saves your life?

30:12.686 --> 30:13.733
Does he say anything?

30:14.104 --> 30:16.983
No, nothing.

30:17.065 --> 30:20.569
Just kills and leaves.

30:21.528 --> 30:23.576
Now can you think
of anyone in particular

30:23.655 --> 30:25.077
who'd want to
save your life?

30:25.157 --> 30:26.784
No.

30:26.867 --> 30:29.620
No.
Plenty of the opposite.

30:29.703 --> 30:30.704
Like who?

30:30.787 --> 30:32.835
If I knew that
I'd take care of 'em myself.

30:35.417 --> 30:38.387
I don't mean
in an unlawful manner.

30:38.462 --> 30:40.590
Well, if you can
think of any names...

30:41.923 --> 30:43.891
Those yellow eyes.

30:47.262 --> 30:51.608
I know they're not real.
It's just a mask.

30:53.268 --> 30:55.521
Yep. Just a mask.

31:00.817 --> 31:04.913
Victim is Eli Kemper, as in
union boss Lionel Kemper's son.

31:09.951 --> 31:11.294
The same MO as Isaac.

31:11.370 --> 31:14.374
Troyer was connected to Isaac.
Maybe Eli was, too.

31:14.456 --> 31:18.962
Troyer's import-export, more than
likely he knows a union boss.

31:19.753 --> 31:21.130
Hmm.

31:24.007 --> 31:26.135
Axes, swords,
and golden feathers.

31:27.469 --> 31:30.939
Anyone else think this is
getting a little mythological?

31:31.014 --> 31:32.482
Maybe Wu was right.

31:34.309 --> 31:35.909
Each victim
had a golden feather.

31:36.436 --> 31:37.938
And one is bigger
than the other.

31:38.021 --> 31:39.541
The intended victim,
Frankie, described

31:39.606 --> 31:41.028
the killer of his
would-be killers

31:41.108 --> 31:43.827
as having sharp teeth,
yellow eyes, pointed ears,

31:43.902 --> 31:45.745
and lots of hair
with stripes on it.

31:45.821 --> 31:47.243
Okay, that's...
Weten Ogen.

31:47.322 --> 31:49.074
Yeah.
We think so.

31:49.157 --> 31:52.036
And we met one yesterday. The
mother of one of the victims.

31:52.119 --> 31:54.042
Wait a minute.
You're saying the killer

31:54.121 --> 31:55.998
and the victim are
both Weten Ogen?

31:56.164 --> 31:58.713
You could be dealing
with the Maagd Zoektocht.

31:58.834 --> 32:01.804
Oh, that is an
ancient Weten Ogen tradition.

32:01.878 --> 32:04.427
I'm talking from the millennium
before the millennium.

32:04.506 --> 32:05.883
You know, how knights
would slay dragons

32:05.966 --> 32:07.309
to win the princess?
It's that.

32:07.676 --> 32:08.928
Basically a maiden quest.

32:09.010 --> 32:11.479
"Maiden quest"?
Like, to win the bride?

32:11.555 --> 32:13.853
It's a way to facilitate
arranged marriages.

32:14.391 --> 32:16.391
I think three
Weten Ogen bachelors, right,

32:16.435 --> 32:18.529
are sent out
to complete the quest

32:18.603 --> 32:20.150
to prove themselves worthy

32:20.230 --> 32:22.403
for the hand of the
fair maiden and her dowry.

32:22.482 --> 32:24.325
But what's weird here is the
quest doesn't normally end

32:24.401 --> 32:26.244
with the participants' death.

32:26.319 --> 32:27.959
Not to say that procuring
a dragon's tooth

32:27.988 --> 32:30.286
didn't have an abnormally high
casualty rate, but still...

32:30.490 --> 32:33.039
Maybe since these Weten Ogen
have criminal ties,

32:33.410 --> 32:34.582
the stakes
have been raised.

32:34.661 --> 32:36.334
As in, the goal
for this quest is...

32:36.413 --> 32:37.790
What's his name?
Frankie's head.

32:37.873 --> 32:39.633
I mean, they're using
axes and swords, right?

32:39.958 --> 32:41.130
Bringing in the head
of the enemy,

32:41.209 --> 32:42.586
it's pretty
standard challenge.

32:42.669 --> 32:45.218
So Isaac and Eli were
opponents in this quest.

32:45.464 --> 32:47.887
So then, who's
the beautiful maiden?

32:48.425 --> 32:49.893
That would be
Troyer's daughter.

32:49.968 --> 32:52.596
Then Troyer must be Weten
Ogen as are all the suitors.

32:52.679 --> 32:53.805
We know Troyer is one.

32:53.889 --> 32:55.562
You know what?
Find the third competitor,

32:55.640 --> 32:57.560
and that's probably
your murderer because they...

32:57.601 --> 32:58.602
You should find him
quickly though

32:58.685 --> 33:00.904
because this quest won't end until
Frankie's head is delivered.

33:00.979 --> 33:03.659
Yeah, and don't expect Troyer to
just, you know, tell you who it is.

33:03.690 --> 33:05.363
But he does have to
bless the third competitor,

33:05.442 --> 33:07.410
who will also have
that third golden feather.

33:07.486 --> 33:09.238
Yeah, we're gonna
keep an eye on Troyer.

33:09.571 --> 33:10.572
HANK; All right, thanks.

33:11.239 --> 33:12.240
Wow.

33:12.324 --> 33:13.371
Weten Ogen.

33:14.534 --> 33:16.753
Honey, would you
slay a dragon for me?

33:16.828 --> 33:18.330
Oh, my God,
a flock of 'em.

33:18.413 --> 33:20.711
Or whatever you call
a great gathering of dragons.

33:21.583 --> 33:22.584
My knight in shining...

33:22.667 --> 33:25.386
No, but I don't do armor.
I got a nickel allergy.

33:28.673 --> 33:31.768
I honestly did not think
you had it in you.

33:32.260 --> 33:33.261
Excuse me?

33:33.428 --> 33:37.183
With both Isaac and Eli out of
your way, you have no competition.

33:38.266 --> 33:39.267
Eli is dead?

33:39.684 --> 33:41.027
We drink to his honor.

33:43.313 --> 33:44.360
He tried.

33:47.776 --> 33:49.699
I didn't do it.
Of course, you didn't.

33:49.778 --> 33:51.325
No, Mr. Troyer,
I swear to you

33:51.404 --> 33:52.872
I had nothing
to do with it.

33:52.948 --> 33:54.700
Amos, you've proven
your cunning,

33:54.783 --> 33:56.535
but you still must
complete your quest.

33:56.618 --> 33:58.871
I don't even want to be here.
My mother made me do this.

33:58.954 --> 34:00.297
I don't want Emily. I'm...

34:02.457 --> 34:03.549
I'm gay.

34:04.668 --> 34:07.171
No one backs out
of the Maagd Zoektocht.

34:08.129 --> 34:10.882
Now you bring me
the head of Frankie Adkins,

34:11.757 --> 34:13.476
or I'll kill you myself.

34:13.760 --> 34:16.058
That son of a bitch
killed my son.

34:40.036 --> 34:41.504
Suspect just left.
Take him down.

34:41.580 --> 34:42.627
Roger that.

34:52.882 --> 34:53.929
Exit the vehicle!

34:55.051 --> 34:56.851
What is this about?
Hands where I can see 'em!

34:56.928 --> 34:59.351
I swear to you I haven't done anything!
Hands up.

35:05.478 --> 35:06.958
That's nothing,
that's just a feather.

35:12.902 --> 35:14.575
How well did you know
Isaac Proctor?

35:16.906 --> 35:17.907
I didn't know him.

35:19.618 --> 35:20.710
What about Eli Kemper?

35:22.329 --> 35:23.330
No.

35:24.623 --> 35:25.670
How do you know Troyer?

35:28.418 --> 35:29.635
He's a friend
of my father's.

35:29.753 --> 35:32.006
Why were you there? I
wanted to see his daughter.

35:32.088 --> 35:33.135
Emily?

35:34.215 --> 35:35.307
Yes.

35:39.721 --> 35:41.598
I think I need to talk
to a lawyer.

35:41.681 --> 35:43.900
A lawyer who can talk to you
about the Maagd Zoektocht?

35:48.521 --> 35:49.693
We know all about
the quest.

35:51.775 --> 35:53.243
We know
Emily's the prize.

35:55.528 --> 35:57.201
- You in love with her?
-  No.

35:58.490 --> 35:59.958
Love has nothing
to do with it,

36:00.033 --> 36:01.660
and I don't know what
you're insinuating, but...

36:01.743 --> 36:04.337
We know you're Weten Ogen.
I'm a Grimm.

36:13.129 --> 36:15.723
Okay, okay, okay.
Yes. Yes, yes, yes,

36:15.799 --> 36:17.051
I was a part of
the Maagd Zoektocht.

36:17.133 --> 36:18.476
So were Isaac and Eli.

36:18.551 --> 36:19.848
But I didn't have
anything to do

36:19.928 --> 36:21.805
with their deaths,
I swear to you!

36:22.430 --> 36:24.398
A beautiful bride
and a fortune,

36:24.474 --> 36:26.397
that's certainly
enough to kill for.

36:26.559 --> 36:28.982
Kill whoever's in your way.
You win and take everything.

36:29.062 --> 36:30.062
I didn't kill them.

36:30.105 --> 36:31.152
Who did?

36:31.815 --> 36:34.739
First, I thought it was Eli, but now
that he's dead, I don't... I don't...

36:36.528 --> 36:38.496
Frankie probably has
hit men on his payroll,

36:38.571 --> 36:40.869
maybe it's Troyer.
I don't know!

36:41.825 --> 36:45.170
You should talk to Troyer.
He's the one who's doing this.

36:50.417 --> 36:51.464
What is it?

36:53.169 --> 36:55.046
Amanda Proctor's here.
The lawyer?

36:55.130 --> 36:58.225
She says she knows something you'll
find very helpful. She's clean.

36:58.383 --> 36:59.384
All right.

37:03.096 --> 37:04.439
You wanna help me?
With what?

37:04.514 --> 37:05.857
I know who wants
your head.

37:08.393 --> 37:09.565
Daniel Troyer.

37:09.644 --> 37:11.692
You kidding me? I never even met the guy.
What did I do to him?

37:11.771 --> 37:13.523
One of your goons
killed his son.

37:13.606 --> 37:15.950
Technically, he's dead
because of you.

37:16.025 --> 37:17.823
That.

37:18.486 --> 37:19.908
Aren't you his lawyer?
Yes.

37:19.988 --> 37:21.456
Then why are you
telling me this?

37:21.531 --> 37:24.159
Because he's responsible
for the death of my son

37:24.784 --> 37:26.878
and I want him dead.

37:29.998 --> 37:31.591
The money needs
to be transferred

37:31.666 --> 37:33.668
into that account
tomorrow morning.

37:33.752 --> 37:35.174
Not half the money,
all the money,

37:35.253 --> 37:36.675
you're not making
a down payment.

37:37.380 --> 37:38.723
No excuses.

37:39.466 --> 37:41.935
You make it happen and you
call me when it's done.

37:42.010 --> 37:43.387
Do you understand?

37:43.887 --> 37:45.104
Oh.

37:45.180 --> 37:47.433
Say hello to your wife
for me, would you?

37:48.057 --> 37:50.025
Excuse me
for letting myself in.

37:52.228 --> 37:54.230
I'm not usually so rude...

37:54.981 --> 37:56.654
Unless I'm really pissed.

37:57.776 --> 38:01.201
Now put the phone down, you
don't wanna dial 911 too early.

38:13.625 --> 38:14.626
Frankie's car.

38:18.421 --> 38:19.889
There must be
some mistake here.

38:19.964 --> 38:21.841
Yes, a big mistake.

38:21.925 --> 38:24.144
You tried to kill me. Twice.

38:24.219 --> 38:25.419
No, I never tried to kill you.

38:25.929 --> 38:28.398
Oh, you didn't,
but your boys did.

38:29.224 --> 38:31.318
Next time tell 'em to use a gun.
It's so much easier.

38:31.392 --> 38:32.439
No, no, don't!

38:32.519 --> 38:34.919
If it wasn't for that guy in the
animal costume, I'd be dead!

38:36.439 --> 38:37.611
Did he look like this?

38:40.026 --> 38:41.027
Oh...

38:41.110 --> 38:42.737
Oh, my God!
What are you?

38:50.870 --> 38:52.247
Police! Back away!

38:56.251 --> 38:57.298
Emily.

38:59.420 --> 39:01.673
Dad. You've been shot.

39:05.969 --> 39:09.940
Need an ambulance. 3430 Warnall
Avenue. We've got a gunshot victim.

39:11.808 --> 39:13.526
I saw him.
I saw him again.

39:13.601 --> 39:14.881
This time,
there were two of 'em.

39:14.936 --> 39:16.416
How many of them are there?

39:16.437 --> 39:18.235
Oh my God,
keep them away from me.

39:18.648 --> 39:19.649
Ambulance is on its way.

39:20.275 --> 39:23.199
We know you're Weten Ogen. We know
all about the Maagd Zoektocht.

39:23.278 --> 39:24.871
I hate that, I never
wanted any part of it.

39:24.946 --> 39:26.698
I never wanted
to marry anybody.

39:26.781 --> 39:28.499
It's their tradition,
not mine.

39:28.575 --> 39:29.575
It's okay.

39:29.617 --> 39:32.791
No, it's not okay.
I just wanted my own life,

39:32.871 --> 39:35.966
and look what this
stupid quest has done.

39:36.040 --> 39:39.089
Emily, the quest
was never for them.

39:39.419 --> 39:40.466
What?

39:40.962 --> 39:43.966
I had to make sure you had
the strength to take over.

39:44.591 --> 39:45.888
I don't understand.

39:46.134 --> 39:48.136
It was always your quest.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.472
Not theirs.

39:50.972 --> 39:54.647
You've proved yourself to be
far more worthy than any man.

40:01.983 --> 40:03.576
Are you gonna arrest me?

40:03.693 --> 40:05.053
No, we're gonna
arrest your father.

40:05.278 --> 40:07.747
But he didn't kill anyone.
It was me that did it.

40:07.822 --> 40:10.371
Every time you killed someone,
it was to save Frankie's life.

40:11.784 --> 40:13.377
Makes it tricky to prosecute.

40:13.494 --> 40:16.088
Your dad's under arrest for
solicitation to kill Frankie Adkins.

40:16.956 --> 40:18.003
Yeah, what's left of him.

40:18.082 --> 40:20.505
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, their eyes.

40:20.585 --> 40:22.838
I don't wanna see 'em.
I just don't wanna see 'em.

40:27.717 --> 40:29.594
Hey.

40:34.015 --> 40:35.495
You look like
you could use some help.

40:35.558 --> 40:36.901
Ora third arm.

40:39.687 --> 40:41.781
It's okay. It's okay.

40:44.525 --> 40:46.323
You look more tired
than he does.

40:46.778 --> 40:47.825
Fun day.

40:55.703 --> 40:56.750
All right.

41:06.631 --> 41:07.632
I was worried.

41:08.800 --> 41:09.801
About Kelly?

41:14.931 --> 41:17.980
No, you. And everything
that's happening.

41:39.539 --> 41:41.257
Stay here.
It's okay. It's okay.

42:05.148 --> 42:06.195
Trubel.

42:06.524 --> 42:07.571
Nick.
