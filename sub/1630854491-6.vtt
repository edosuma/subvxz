[screeching]

00:14.973 --> 00:18.226
-Okay, Thunder Sisters.
Game faces!

00:18.268 --> 00:22.022
Time to throw some crow.
So says...

00:22.063 --> 00:24.149
[echoing]
<i>Queen o' Wimmins!</i>

00:24.190 --> 00:25.483
-[laughs] No problem.

00:25.525 --> 00:27.986
This is nothing compared
to our last few fights.

00:28.028 --> 00:32.532
[all cheering]

00:32.574 --> 00:35.702
And a few crowverines
are no match for...

00:35.744 --> 00:36.953
[echoing]
<i>Bloodhorn!</i>

00:36.995 --> 00:38.830
-And this is
a piece of cake for...

00:38.872 --> 00:40.540
[echoing]
<i>Bogwater!</i>

00:40.582 --> 00:41.666
Also, piece of cake?

00:41.708 --> 00:43.918
-Don't mind if I do
because I'm Thunk!

00:43.960 --> 00:45.295
[loud eating]

00:45.337 --> 00:48.381
-And these crowverines
can't handle my moves!

00:48.423 --> 00:49.382
[grunting]

00:49.424 --> 00:51.134
[echoing]
<i>'Cause I'm Fireheart!</i>

00:51.176 --> 00:53.053
-Those crowverines
are going down!

00:53.094 --> 00:54.471
Down to the ground!

00:54.512 --> 00:57.057
Even lower than
the ground! In a hole.

00:57.098 --> 00:59.142
Because that's
how holes work. Also,

00:59.184 --> 01:00.727
[echoing]
<i>I'm Sister Sunset!</i>

01:00.769 --> 01:02.270
-Let's do a victory cheer!

01:02.312 --> 01:04.064
-A victory cheer?!

01:04.105 --> 01:06.358
Your fight hasn't
even started yet!

01:06.399 --> 01:08.068
[hissing]
Where's Seeker?

01:08.109 --> 01:09.569
[snarling]

01:09.611 --> 01:11.237
[echoing coo]

01:11.279 --> 01:12.530
Seeker, too?

01:12.572 --> 01:15.283
So you all took
your eye off the beak.

01:15.325 --> 01:18.244
Well, you better get your eye
back on it before--

01:18.286 --> 01:21.122
Ah! [grunting]

01:54.155 --> 01:55.198
What's all this?

01:55.240 --> 01:57.075
-We're going
to the warm springs.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.994
To celebrate our victory!
Woo-hoo!

02:00.036 --> 02:01.413
-Your victory?

02:01.454 --> 02:03.790
I beat the crovwerines on my own

02:03.832 --> 02:07.377
while you skinbags were busy
patting yourselves on the back!

02:07.419 --> 02:10.088

-You're going to Camp Thunder!
-[thunder]

02:18.888 --> 02:22.142
-I'll never get used to that.
-Camp Thunder? What's that?

02:22.183 --> 02:24.561
-Let me tell you a little story.

02:24.602 --> 02:28.148
<i>Many moons ago, there</i>
<i>were some Thunder Sisters</i>

02:28.189 --> 02:31.526
<i>who were used to winning,</i>
<i>just like you.</i>

02:31.568 --> 02:33.862
<i>But winning</i>
<i>was so easy for them,</i>

02:33.903 --> 02:37.073
<i>they stopped trying.</i>
<i>Long story short,</i>

02:37.115 --> 02:39.409
<i>they ended up trapped</i>
<i>in an underground labyrinth</i>

02:39.451 --> 02:41.244
<i>being chased by badgerillas.</i>

02:41.286 --> 02:42.704
-And how did that end?

02:42.746 --> 02:45.331
-How do you think it ended?
-With a group hug?

02:45.373 --> 02:48.209
-No! They were never seen again!
-[thunder]

02:48.251 --> 02:50.879
-[whimpers]
-Okay, but we're not them,

02:50.920 --> 02:52.839
so that'll never happen to us.

02:52.881 --> 02:53.882
-That's right.

02:53.923 --> 02:56.301
Because you're going
to Camp Thunder!

02:56.343 --> 02:59.012
-[thunder]
-[Thunk yelps, sighs]

02:59.054 --> 03:01.348
-Every time.
-Maybe Gran's right.

03:01.389 --> 03:03.141
Maybe we <i>aren't</i>
trying hard enough.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.893
-Only because we don't have to.

03:04.934 --> 03:07.729
-Exactly. We're amazing.

03:07.771 --> 03:09.731
So, warm springs?

03:09.773 --> 03:12.192
-Well,
this is important to Gran.

03:12.233 --> 03:13.485
And camps are fun,

03:13.526 --> 03:16.363
-so why don't we give it a shot?
-Sure. Fresh air,

03:16.404 --> 03:18.490
good friends, thunder.
What's not to like?

03:18.531 --> 03:20.700
-What about Dad, Grug, and Guy?
-Yeah.

03:20.742 --> 03:23.703
Remember what happened
the last time we left
them home alone?

03:23.745 --> 03:25.205
-Cocobooms away!

03:25.246 --> 03:27.290
-[explosion]
-GRUG/GUY/PHIL: Yes!

03:27.332 --> 03:29.209

-[clears throat]

03:29.250 --> 03:31.836
-H-hi, honey. Welcome home?
[nervous laugh]

03:31.878 --> 03:34.381
-As long as they're busy,
they can't get into trouble.

03:34.422 --> 03:36.216
I'll handle it while
the rest of you pack.

03:36.257 --> 03:38.593
THUNK: So, what are
you guys gonna pack?

03:38.635 --> 03:40.804
Should I bring my nice pelt?

03:40.845 --> 03:42.597
-So while we're gone,
we need you three

03:42.639 --> 03:44.683
to guard the well
in case it's attacked.

03:44.724 --> 03:47.143
-Who would attack a well?
-Wellions.

03:47.185 --> 03:48.603
Roving marauders,

03:48.645 --> 03:51.564
driven by
an unquenchable thirst.

03:51.606 --> 03:54.901
-Uh, yeah. Wellions.
Exactly. So, good luck!

03:54.943 --> 03:58.154
-Gran, what's Camp Thunder like?
-Yeah! Are there zip-vines?

03:58.196 --> 03:59.823
-And wind rafting?
-And warm springs?

03:59.864 --> 04:02.242
-And a fire
to roast mossmallows?

04:02.283 --> 04:03.910
-And maybe warm springs?
-GRAN: No!

04:03.952 --> 04:06.746
It's cold and dark,
and it's always wet,

04:06.788 --> 04:09.499
and there's nothing but dirt
and sticks and other sticks.

04:09.541 --> 04:12.669
And definitely
no roasting mossmallows!

04:12.711 --> 04:14.921
You'll be too tired and filthy

04:14.963 --> 04:16.589
and miserable!

04:16.631 --> 04:19.551
-But...
-But nothing!

04:19.592 --> 04:22.303
That's it! You egg yolks
have forgotten what it means

04:22.345 --> 04:23.930
to be a Thunder Sister.

04:23.972 --> 04:26.558
We don't just fight
when we feel like it.

04:26.599 --> 04:30.437
We bring the thunder every time,
no matter what!

04:30.478 --> 04:33.440
-Unless we don't need to.
-Every! Single!

04:33.481 --> 04:35.942
-Time.
-[Thunk shrieks]

04:35.984 --> 04:37.610
-Ugh. That sounds exhausting.

04:37.652 --> 04:40.113
-Because you've gone soft!

04:40.155 --> 04:41.865
And Camp Thunder
is gonna make you

04:41.906 --> 04:44.534
hard as the rocks
you're gonna sleep on!

04:44.576 --> 04:46.286
-Can I get a soft rock?

04:46.327 --> 04:48.204
If it isn't,
I won't sleep a wink.

04:48.246 --> 04:49.414
-This is ridiculous.

04:49.456 --> 04:51.374
We don't need any of this!
It's beneath us.

04:51.416 --> 04:53.626
-Or <i>maybe</i>it'll be good for us.

04:53.668 --> 04:56.755
After all, Gran <i>has</i>been doing
this a lot longer than we have.

04:56.796 --> 04:59.966
-Gran's been doing <i>everything</i>
a lot longer than we have.

05:00.008 --> 05:03.136
And the last thing
we need is to get better.
We're already the best.

05:03.178 --> 05:04.554
-Ow.
-Thunk, what happened?

05:04.596 --> 05:07.223
-The wind blew on me. Ow!

05:07.265 --> 05:08.433
HOPE: What now?

05:08.475 --> 05:10.685
THUNK:
I hurt my mouth saying "ow!"

05:11.811 --> 05:13.313
[Grug grunting]

05:13.355 --> 05:14.981
-Are we <i>sure</i>the well
needs to be guarded?

05:15.023 --> 05:18.068
-Yes, because Ugga said so,
and she's never wrong.

05:18.109 --> 05:20.904
-And how do we know <i>that</i>?
-Because Ugga said so!

05:20.945 --> 05:23.239
-Also, water is
the source of all life,

05:23.281 --> 05:27.202
so the well is an irresistible
target for sabotage by...

05:27.243 --> 05:29.496
[echoing]
<i>lawless Wellions.</i>

05:29.537 --> 05:31.373
-Wellions.
Are we sure that's a thing?

05:31.414 --> 05:33.583
-Of course, it is, Guy.
-But how do we <i>know</i>?

05:33.625 --> 05:35.752
-Because <i>I</i>said so.
-[sighs]

05:35.794 --> 05:38.254
-So what should
we call ourselves?

05:38.296 --> 05:39.506
The Well Guards?

05:39.547 --> 05:41.466
-No way! We're the Wellions!

05:41.508 --> 05:44.177
-No. The Wellions
are our adversaries.

05:44.219 --> 05:45.762
-Aw, but that's a cool name!

05:45.804 --> 05:47.639
Can't <i>we</i>be the Wellions, too?

05:47.681 --> 05:50.016
-No. Too confusing.
Which is why

05:50.058 --> 05:52.477
we are now the Guard Wells!

05:52.519 --> 05:54.187
-Guard Wells?
I said Well Guards.

05:54.229 --> 05:55.480
You just flipped
the words around.

05:55.522 --> 05:57.357
-Yes, Guy,
it <i>is</i>the perfect name.

05:57.399 --> 05:58.858
Because we're guarding the well,

05:58.900 --> 06:02.278
and we're doing it <i>well</i>.
It works on two levels.

06:02.320 --> 06:03.947
-Does it, though?

06:06.408 --> 06:08.868
-Welcome to Camp Thunder!

06:08.910 --> 06:12.497
-SANDY: [confused grunting]
-[wind blowing]

06:12.539 --> 06:13.707
-Where?
-Right here!

06:13.748 --> 06:15.291
-Is it underground?

06:15.333 --> 06:16.751
-No! You're looking at it!

06:16.793 --> 06:19.087
-So it's invisible! Cool!
-GRAN: What?

06:19.129 --> 06:21.840
No! This is it!

06:21.881 --> 06:23.883
-You weren't kidding
about the sticks.

06:23.925 --> 06:27.053
-Or the other sticks.
But at least it smells good.

06:27.095 --> 06:29.305
-What is that? Huh?
-THUNK: Roasted mossmallows.

06:29.347 --> 06:32.642
How do you like yours?
Totally uncooked or on fire?

06:32.684 --> 06:35.687
-I said no roasting mossmallows!

06:35.729 --> 06:37.480
They'll attract alli-goaters!

06:37.522 --> 06:39.524
And who said
you could make a fire?!

06:39.566 --> 06:41.651
-Oh, that wasn't me.
That was Carlos.

06:41.693 --> 06:43.236
-[stomach growls]
-[whisper] Sorry, Carlos.

06:43.278 --> 06:45.155
Somebody had to take the heat
for this eat.

06:45.196 --> 06:48.825
-Okay. Are you ready
for some brutal Thunder drills

06:48.867 --> 06:51.536
to get your heads back
in the Thunder game?

06:51.578 --> 06:53.121
-Do they have to be brutal?

06:53.163 --> 06:56.916
-Yes! Some old-fashioned mud,
sweat, and tears is the only way

06:56.958 --> 07:00.503
to get your thunder back.
Any questions?

07:00.545 --> 07:02.213
-Is there a no tears option?

07:02.255 --> 07:03.798
-Is there a no sweat option?

07:03.840 --> 07:05.675
UGGA: What drills?
There's nothing here.

07:05.717 --> 07:07.385
-Where are we supposed to sit?

07:07.427 --> 07:08.553
* *

07:08.595 --> 07:10.138
-And eat?

07:10.180 --> 07:11.181
* *

07:11.222 --> 07:12.390
-And go to the bathroom?

07:12.432 --> 07:13.850
* *

07:13.892 --> 07:16.519
[laughs] Rocks wear
a lot of hats around here.

07:16.561 --> 07:17.937
-No more questions!

07:17.979 --> 07:21.191
Now, the first thing
you gotta do at Camp Thunder

07:21.232 --> 07:23.151
is <i>make</i>Camp Thunder.

07:23.193 --> 07:25.987
So you're gonna chop down a tree
and get some wood.

07:26.029 --> 07:28.698
Then, you're gonna use
that wood to build a hut.

07:28.740 --> 07:31.201
-That's it? We can do that
with our hands tied.

07:31.242 --> 07:33.370
-Funny you should say that.

07:33.411 --> 07:34.996
-[Thunk shrieks]
-[all grumbling]

07:35.038 --> 07:38.875
-Okay, guys. This time,
that tree is going down.

07:38.917 --> 07:40.710
[yelling]

07:40.752 --> 07:42.337
[grunts, groans]

07:42.379 --> 07:43.630
-Why are we even doing this?

07:43.672 --> 07:45.382
I mean, if we were
fighting a ramaconda, sure.

07:45.423 --> 07:46.925
That's worth the effort,

07:46.966 --> 07:49.219
but chopping down a tree like
this is a waste of our time.

07:49.260 --> 07:51.096
-But, isn't that what Gran
was talking about?

07:51.137 --> 07:54.224
No matter what it is, we should
try our best every single time?

07:54.265 --> 07:55.642
-Sure. Except this time

07:55.684 --> 07:58.395
because there's
a bunch of wood right there.

07:58.436 --> 08:00.063
-This is a real dilemma.

08:01.106 --> 08:02.941
-Woodpile it is!
-[all panting]

08:04.192 --> 08:07.153
[panting continues]

08:07.195 --> 08:09.698
-[crack]
-Ow! Splinter!

08:09.739 --> 08:11.908
-That's not a splinter.
That's dirt.

08:11.950 --> 08:13.785
-And that's not a pile of wood.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.078
It's an alli-goater nest!

08:15.120 --> 08:17.038
-[growling, snarling]
-[all scream]

08:17.080 --> 08:17.831

-[roaring]

08:20.250 --> 08:21.418
[Thunk shrieks]

08:21.459 --> 08:23.253
-Ugh! Are we done?

08:23.294 --> 08:25.380
My splinters have splinters!

08:25.422 --> 08:26.798
-Mm, still dirt, Hope.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.299
[yelling, grunts]

08:28.341 --> 08:29.801
-What is that supposed to be?

08:29.843 --> 08:31.553
-What do you mean? It's a hut.

08:31.594 --> 08:33.013
-Not from where I'm standing.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.973
-Okay, so it's not
the tree house.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.308
-True. It's <i>definitely</i>
not the tree house.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.352
-But, it could be a relative
of the tree house

08:39.394 --> 08:40.729
that no one likes to talk about.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.814
-It's pretty good considering
our hands were tied.

08:42.856 --> 08:46.735
-Is it? Or is that just
another excuse for not trying?!

08:46.776 --> 08:49.070
-Does it matter?
We're not gonna live here.

08:49.112 --> 08:50.864
We're just staying
here for a little bit.

08:50.905 --> 08:53.158
-How? There's no door!

08:53.199 --> 08:57.037
THUNK [muffled] Oh, yeah?
Then how did I get in here?

08:57.078 --> 09:00.123
Wait!
How do I get outta here? Help!

09:00.165 --> 09:03.585
-Now, follow me. Maybe you
won't blow the next challenge.

09:03.626 --> 09:05.795
[sighing, groaning]

09:05.837 --> 09:07.547
THUNK [muffled]
Hello? Anyone?

09:07.589 --> 09:08.840
[Thunk shrieks]

09:08.882 --> 09:10.800
-Your next challenge is proving

09:10.842 --> 09:13.219
you can bring
the thunder anywhere.

09:13.261 --> 09:16.723
So you're gonna climb
to the top of Slippery Hill.

09:16.765 --> 09:18.641
-Easy. We got this.

09:18.683 --> 09:20.643
I mean, how slippery can it be?

09:20.685 --> 09:22.687
Ah! [grunts]
[muffled] Pretty slippery.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.981
-No problem. We'll just
get some sappy leaves,

09:25.023 --> 09:26.900
put them on our feet, and
we'll be up there in no time.

09:26.941 --> 09:29.694
-You didn't let me finish.

09:29.736 --> 09:34.115
[straining, groaning]

09:34.157 --> 09:37.786
-Ah! What does this have to do
with being a Thunder Sister?!

09:37.827 --> 09:39.371
-What are you
talking about, Hope?

09:39.412 --> 09:40.997
There are moments in every fight

09:41.039 --> 09:43.083
when you have to stop
and push a giant boulder

09:43.124 --> 09:44.834
up a slippery hill.
-There are?!

09:44.876 --> 09:46.628
UGGA: Of course not!
This is ridiculous!

09:46.670 --> 09:49.005
-Pipe down!
Less talk, more rock.

09:49.047 --> 09:50.757
Also, look out for this rock!

09:50.799 --> 09:52.467
-Ah! Mom!
-[straining continues]

09:52.509 --> 09:53.677
-Can we take a break?

09:53.718 --> 09:55.845
My sappy leaves
are losing their sap.

09:55.887 --> 09:57.180
-And maybe have a snack?

09:57.222 --> 09:59.683
My happy Carlos
is losing his hap.

09:59.724 --> 10:02.018
-[stomach growls]
-Easy, Carlos. I'm on your side.

10:02.060 --> 10:04.521
-No!
Thunder doesn't take a break,

10:04.562 --> 10:06.064
and it doesn't eat snacks!

10:06.106 --> 10:08.525
-Guys, the challenge
is to make it to the top,

10:08.566 --> 10:12.028
so we gotta keep trying
until we get there. Right?

10:12.070 --> 10:14.364
-Couldn't have said it
better myself, other girl!

10:14.406 --> 10:16.741
-Well, <i>I'm</i>saying
we're close enough.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.952
-Yeah, Gran.
The top's right there!

10:18.993 --> 10:20.704
And I'm all sapped out!

10:20.745 --> 10:22.872
-And I've had enough
of Slippery Hill.

10:22.914 --> 10:24.374
I'm going down.

10:24.416 --> 10:26.626
-You sure are going down.

10:26.668 --> 10:27.877
[yelling, grunting]

10:27.919 --> 10:29.254
BOTH:
Huh?

10:30.296 --> 10:31.798
-Boulder!
-Dash!

10:31.840 --> 10:33.633
[both yelling]

10:33.675 --> 10:34.968
[all yelling]

10:35.010 --> 10:38.179
-[screaming]
-[Gran grunting]

10:38.221 --> 10:39.222
* *

10:39.264 --> 10:41.808
-[grunts]
How is Gran so good at...

10:41.850 --> 10:43.768
[gasps] steering boulders?

10:43.810 --> 10:47.022
-I try!
You should try it sometime!

10:47.063 --> 10:48.857
-[back cracks]
-At least we're not slipping.

10:48.898 --> 10:51.568
-I'm slipping! I'm slipping!

10:51.609 --> 10:53.403
[all screaming]

10:53.445 --> 10:58.324
-Oh, <i>Slippery</i>Hill!
Now, I get it. [laughs]

10:58.366 --> 11:00.744
PHIL: Mm-hmm.
All clear in the pigator pen,

11:00.785 --> 11:02.412
nothing to report
in the burnip patch,

11:02.454 --> 11:04.414
and the lagoon is undisturbed.

11:04.456 --> 11:06.583
No threats whatsoever
from any direction.

11:06.624 --> 11:10.170
-Huh, that's weird, because Ugga
said the well was in danger,

11:10.211 --> 11:12.130
and it was up to us
to keep it safe.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.424
-Is it <i>possible</i>
that Ugga told us

11:14.466 --> 11:16.051
we needed to protect the well

11:16.092 --> 11:18.428
just to keep us busy
while they're gone?

11:19.429 --> 11:22.432
[laughter]

11:22.474 --> 11:24.559
-No way!
-Impossible.

11:24.601 --> 11:26.102
-And why are you so sure?

11:26.144 --> 11:27.604
-Because Ugga said so.

11:27.645 --> 11:29.439
-The danger is real, Guy.

11:29.481 --> 11:32.650
But so was the error in our
approach to this critical task.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.486
-And what error is that, Phil?

11:34.527 --> 11:36.196
-The Wellions are no fools.

11:36.237 --> 11:38.365
They understand a no-win
situation when they see one.

11:38.406 --> 11:41.701
I mean, look at us!
We're an invincible rampart!

11:41.743 --> 11:44.329
If you were them,
would you attack us?

11:44.371 --> 11:47.957
-You? Definitely.
You? As soon as you fall asleep.

11:47.999 --> 11:49.709
-Ha! I never fall...

11:49.751 --> 11:51.419
[snores]

11:51.461 --> 11:52.253
...asleep.

11:52.295 --> 11:54.297
-You're not a Wellion, Guy.

11:54.339 --> 11:56.424
They're far more clever
than you and Grug,

11:56.466 --> 11:59.302
and they'll never attack
if they can <i>see</i>us.

11:59.344 --> 12:03.390
That's why
we need to be... <i>invisible.</i>

12:03.431 --> 12:04.974
-Or, if that's true,

12:05.016 --> 12:06.685
we could stand here,
and they won't attack.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.645
-We can't stand
here forever, Guy.

12:08.687 --> 12:10.689
-I can 'cause I don't fall...

12:10.730 --> 12:12.065
[snoring]

12:12.107 --> 12:13.483
-The only way
to protect the well

12:13.525 --> 12:15.944
is to stage an ambush
in the last place...

12:15.985 --> 12:18.905
[echoing]
the Wellions would expect.

12:18.947 --> 12:20.907
-[echoing] Where's that?

12:20.949 --> 12:24.494
-Alright, Thunder Sisters!
For your next challenge,

12:24.536 --> 12:28.206
you're gonna clear
all the grass from this field!

12:28.248 --> 12:31.710
I don't wanna see
a single blade left.

12:31.751 --> 12:34.004
-Okay.
And <i>why</i>are we doing this?

12:34.045 --> 12:37.549
-Well, I thought it'd be nice
to put in a swimming hole.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.009
-Really? Yes!
-No!

12:39.050 --> 12:42.262
You're gonna dig deep
to prove you can dig deep!

12:42.303 --> 12:44.389
If you can work
the land with thunder,

12:44.431 --> 12:46.850
you can fight
the enemy with thunder!

12:46.891 --> 12:50.895
Also, sometimes you need to bury
things in a hurry. Like bodies.

12:50.937 --> 12:54.357
-[sighs]
-So, you want us to try to...

12:54.399 --> 12:55.650
mow a lawn?

12:55.692 --> 12:57.235
-Ah, thanks for waking up

12:57.277 --> 12:59.279
and joining the party,
Fireheart!

12:59.320 --> 13:01.406
-What's the catch?
There's always a catch.

13:01.448 --> 13:02.699
-No. No catch.

13:02.741 --> 13:05.035
All you gotta do
is cut the grass.

13:05.076 --> 13:06.202
With your teeth!

13:06.244 --> 13:08.621
-[Hope gasps]
-[maniacal laughter]

13:08.663 --> 13:09.622
-There it is.

13:09.664 --> 13:11.041
-Alright! An eating challenge!

13:11.082 --> 13:12.584
It's about time.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.419
-You <i>want</i>to eat grass, Thunk?

13:14.461 --> 13:17.297
-[whispers] Shh! I'm trying
to throw Carlos a bone.

13:17.339 --> 13:19.466
He is so over Camp Thunder.

13:19.507 --> 13:21.301
-Come on.
Let's just get this over with.

13:21.343 --> 13:23.136
The sooner we're done,
the sooner we can go home.

13:23.178 --> 13:25.013
-That's the spirit!

13:25.055 --> 13:26.514
[screeching, munching]

13:26.556 --> 13:27.807
[chewing]

13:27.849 --> 13:30.894
-Hey. This grass isn't so bad.
It tastes like...

13:30.935 --> 13:33.730
Grass! Yup, definitely grass.

13:33.772 --> 13:37.025
-Ugh! You know where
you don't <i>have</i>to eat grass?

13:37.067 --> 13:39.027
-The warm springs!
-[Sandy chewing, gags]

13:39.069 --> 13:40.445
You said it, Sandy!

13:40.487 --> 13:42.697
-Well, the good news
is we're almost done.

13:42.739 --> 13:43.698
-What are you talking about?

13:43.740 --> 13:45.033
We've barely made a dent!

13:45.075 --> 13:46.493
-Sorry.
I meant we're almost done

13:46.534 --> 13:49.079
with <i>this</i>part
of a much bigger field.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.039
-Come on, guys!
We got to keep going

13:51.081 --> 13:52.957
if we ever wanna see
that swimming hole.

13:52.999 --> 13:55.627
-Thunk! There's not gonna
be a swimming hole!

13:55.669 --> 13:57.003
-Not with <i>that</i>attitude.

13:57.045 --> 13:58.254
-What are <i>you</i>talking about?

13:58.296 --> 13:59.798
You're not even helping!

13:59.839 --> 14:01.341
-[chewing] Mm!

14:01.383 --> 14:03.760
I think I ate some grass
in my mossmallow.

14:03.802 --> 14:05.720
I gotta say, kinda works.

14:05.762 --> 14:08.848
-Wait.
Didn't Gran say mossmallows
attract alli-goaters?

14:08.890 --> 14:10.100
-Thunk! Get rid of those!

14:10.141 --> 14:11.768
-On it! [loud chewing]

14:11.810 --> 14:14.437
-Hold on. I got a better idea.

14:14.479 --> 14:16.940
-Now, <i>this</i>is how
you clear a field.

14:16.981 --> 14:20.235
-[roaring, chomping]
-[Sandy cheering]

14:20.276 --> 14:22.112
-[snarling]
-[Gran grunts]

14:22.153 --> 14:23.279
[all scream]

14:23.321 --> 14:24.698
-It's a shame you log bumps

14:24.739 --> 14:28.034
don't try as hard as
you're trying to avoid trying!

14:28.076 --> 14:30.120
-Can you say that
again but slower?

14:30.161 --> 14:33.164
-No! Chew on it while
you're getting chewed on!

14:33.998 --> 14:35.125
[whistles]

14:36.418 --> 14:37.961
-Ah! Run!

14:38.003 --> 14:40.463
-[all yelling]
-[Sandy cheering]

14:40.505 --> 14:41.756
[Thunk shrieks]

14:41.798 --> 14:43.049
UGGA:
No more grass.

14:43.091 --> 14:44.592
-Happy now, Mom?
-Sure.

14:44.634 --> 14:47.971
Because now, you snail leeches
can start digging.

14:48.013 --> 14:50.306
-For a swimming hole?
Nice plot twist.

14:50.348 --> 14:52.642
-No! For your next challenge!

14:52.684 --> 14:55.854
You gotta prove that nothing
stops your thunder,

14:55.895 --> 14:57.272
even dying.

14:57.313 --> 15:00.150
So you're gonna
bury yourselves alive!

15:00.191 --> 15:03.069
And then,
you're gonna dig your way free,

15:03.111 --> 15:05.405
using nothing but these!

15:05.447 --> 15:06.322
[all groan]

15:06.364 --> 15:08.324
Groaning won't move that dirt.

15:10.201 --> 15:11.619
-No.
-No what?

15:11.661 --> 15:14.706
-No. We're not doing this.
-Think again, Bloodhorn.

15:14.748 --> 15:17.167
-Yeah, I don't need to because
we've done everything you asked,

15:17.208 --> 15:19.127
no matter how pointless,
but it's never enough.

15:19.169 --> 15:20.503
And now, you've gone too far.

15:20.545 --> 15:24.257
-Too far, huh?
Do you all feel that way?

15:24.299 --> 15:26.009
-ALL: Mm-hmm.
-To be fair,

15:26.051 --> 15:28.511
I thought you went too far
before we started.

15:28.553 --> 15:29.888
-Sorry to hear that.

15:29.929 --> 15:33.058
There's only
one thing left to do.

15:33.099 --> 15:34.893
-[blowing]
-[all yelp]

15:34.934 --> 15:36.936
[snoring]

15:36.978 --> 15:39.022
Thunder or bust.

15:39.064 --> 15:40.565
[thunder]

15:45.320 --> 15:46.780
Ha! Those Wellions

15:46.821 --> 15:49.240
will never see us
coming from down here!

15:49.282 --> 15:51.368
And thanks to my genius,

15:51.409 --> 15:54.245
the Dinner-Go-Round
is now a Well-Go-Down.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.289
-Except the Dinner-Go-Round
was my idea.

15:56.331 --> 15:58.833
-So was the Well-Go-Down.
-Ha! Good one, Guy.

15:58.875 --> 16:02.212
Grug? Are you sure you secured
the vine properly?

16:02.253 --> 16:05.507
-[scoffs]
Of course. I know vines.

16:05.548 --> 16:06.841
[screaming]

16:07.926 --> 16:08.885
[groans]

16:08.927 --> 16:09.928
[gasps]

16:09.969 --> 16:11.137
-Mom...

16:11.179 --> 16:13.056
-Is this a dream?

16:13.098 --> 16:15.392
Because most of
my dreams start in caves.

16:15.433 --> 16:17.727
-Mm, feels real to me. [groans]

16:17.769 --> 16:20.480
Especially the rock
digging into my back.

16:20.522 --> 16:23.024
Whoa!
I just had the <i>weirdest</i>dream.

16:23.066 --> 16:24.317
We moved to a farm

16:24.359 --> 16:26.945
and lived in a tree house
with a family named...

16:26.986 --> 16:29.239
Hm. Starts with a B...

16:29.280 --> 16:30.949
-Betterman.
-No, th-that's not it.

16:30.990 --> 16:34.327
-Yes, it is.
That wasn't a dream.
That's reality.

16:34.369 --> 16:36.996
-Oh, yeah?
Then why are we still in a cave?

16:37.038 --> 16:39.165
Game, set, Thunk.

16:39.207 --> 16:40.375
[yawns]

16:40.417 --> 16:43.503
-Oh, good!
We made it to the warm springs.

16:43.545 --> 16:46.339
Except I remember
the warm springs being warmer

16:46.381 --> 16:49.384
and more springy.
And definitely not this cavey.

16:49.426 --> 16:52.178
-Because this isn't
the warm springs, Hope.

16:52.220 --> 16:54.431
This is another one
of Gran's challenges.

16:54.472 --> 16:55.682
-How can you be so sure?

16:55.724 --> 16:58.101
-Two reasons.
One, Gran isn't here,

16:58.143 --> 17:01.021
and two, sleep dart,
courtesy of Gran.

17:01.062 --> 17:03.064
-Oh, yeah.
She loves those things.

17:03.106 --> 17:04.899
Almost as much
as she loves teeth.

17:04.941 --> 17:06.443
-[growling]
-[Ugga laughs]

17:06.484 --> 17:08.820
-It's okay, Sandy.
We'll beat this,

17:08.862 --> 17:11.948
just like we beat every other
challenge Gran has thrown at us.

17:11.990 --> 17:14.909
-Because we're Thunder Sisters!

17:14.951 --> 17:17.370
Let's go.

17:17.412 --> 17:19.622
-Are we Thunder Sisters?
-Of course, we are.

17:19.664 --> 17:21.207
-Okay. Name one thunder thing

17:21.249 --> 17:22.667
we've done since
we got to Camp Thunder.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.253
-Well, we built that hut.
-With no door.

17:25.295 --> 17:28.923
-We pushed Gran <i>and</i>that bouldr
to the top of Slippery Hill!

17:28.965 --> 17:30.383
-Almost. Then, we quit.

17:30.425 --> 17:33.053
-Ugh! Is this tunnel
going anywhere?

17:33.094 --> 17:34.304
This cave is like a labyrinth!

17:34.346 --> 17:36.973
-What about the grass, Dawn?
Who ate that?

17:37.015 --> 17:38.641
-The alli-goater!
-Okay, fine!

17:38.683 --> 17:40.435
But, we <i>could</i>have done
all those things.

17:40.477 --> 17:41.728
-Yeah, but we didn't.

17:41.770 --> 17:44.230
Look, I'm not saying
we're not awesome

17:44.272 --> 17:48.068
because we are, <i>when</i>we give
all the thunder we've got.

17:48.109 --> 17:50.236
But, we don't always do that.

17:50.278 --> 17:52.280
Sometimes, our thunder
is more like a rattle.

17:52.322 --> 17:55.575
-So, we're
Rattle Sisters, too? Nice!

17:56.951 --> 17:58.745
-[Sandy coos]
-EEP: Hm...

17:58.787 --> 18:02.082
-Dawn's right.
-And we're so wrong.

18:02.123 --> 18:04.250
-Yeah. So, what do we do now?

18:04.292 --> 18:06.586
-We bring the thunder for real.

18:06.628 --> 18:08.922
-Really? That worked? Woo!

18:08.963 --> 18:11.299
[intense voice]
How you like me now, Thunder?!

18:11.341 --> 18:14.761
-Thunder Sisters on three.

18:14.803 --> 18:16.846
-Thunk? Come on!
We're doing a cheer.

18:16.888 --> 18:18.014
[whimpering]
Thunk?

18:18.056 --> 18:20.225
-I-I think we should
do a scream instead.

18:20.266 --> 18:21.851
[growling]

18:21.893 --> 18:22.936
* *

18:22.977 --> 18:24.938
[roaring]

18:24.979 --> 18:26.064
[screaming]

18:26.106 --> 18:27.440
UGGA:
Badgerillas!

18:27.482 --> 18:30.485
Wait. Badgerillas.
Labyrinth. [gasps]

18:30.527 --> 18:31.778
This is just like Gran's story

18:31.820 --> 18:33.530
about those other
Thunder Sisters!

18:33.571 --> 18:36.616
-Oh, no!
That story didn't end well!

18:36.658 --> 18:38.410
-[roaring]
-EEP: It's okay, guys.

18:38.451 --> 18:41.121
Because we decide
how this story ends.

18:41.162 --> 18:42.831
And what doesn't take a day off?

18:42.872 --> 18:45.333
-Trees?
-Close, but I was looking for...

18:45.375 --> 18:46.793
-Air?
-Not quite.

18:46.835 --> 18:47.961
-It's...
-Thunder!

18:48.003 --> 18:49.045
[snarling]

18:49.087 --> 18:50.547
Thunder doesn't take a day off!

18:50.588 --> 18:52.340
-Yeah! Care to join me?

18:52.382 --> 18:54.342
-With all my thunder.

18:54.384 --> 18:55.844
[both laugh]

18:55.885 --> 18:57.637
-[roaring]
-[Dawn and Eep yelling]

18:57.679 --> 19:00.140
-[grunts]
-[growling]

19:00.181 --> 19:02.308
[roaring]

19:02.350 --> 19:04.436
-After you, Bogwater.
-Oh, no.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.146
I'll follow you, Bloodhorn.

19:06.187 --> 19:08.231
-Or we could
just do this together.

19:08.273 --> 19:09.274
-Even better. Yeah.

19:09.315 --> 19:11.026
[both panting]

19:11.067 --> 19:12.652
[yelling]

19:13.361 --> 19:15.071
[snarling]

19:15.113 --> 19:18.867
-Hey, Sandy.
Wanna go for a spin?
-[growling]

19:22.037 --> 19:24.080
[growling]

19:24.122 --> 19:25.498
-Oof! Gotta say,

19:25.540 --> 19:28.168
trying feels <i>a lot</i>better
than not trying.

19:28.209 --> 19:30.378
-[badgerilla roaring]
-DAWN: Oh no.

19:30.420 --> 19:32.339
Our company has company!

19:32.380 --> 19:33.840
-Maybe we should try
to get outta here?

19:33.882 --> 19:37.510
-Way ahead of you!
[shrieking]

19:37.552 --> 19:41.598
-Lava leap!
-[all grunting]

19:41.639 --> 19:44.726
-Rock rush!
-[all panting]

19:44.768 --> 19:47.896
-Vine time!
-[all cheering]

19:47.937 --> 19:50.231
-Crevice... Wait.

19:50.273 --> 19:52.359
Is this a crevice or a crevasse?

19:52.400 --> 19:54.194
-Pretty sure
it's a crevice! [grunts]

19:54.235 --> 19:56.988
-Thanks. Crevice crush!

19:57.030 --> 19:58.531
[grunts] Hm...

19:58.573 --> 20:01.868
That would have also worked
for a crevasse. [grunts]

20:01.910 --> 20:03.286
-Labyrinth lost!

20:03.328 --> 20:05.038
* *

20:05.080 --> 20:09.042
-Okay. We've <i>definitely</i>been
in <i>this</i>tunnel before.

20:09.084 --> 20:10.585
-Right! Because we're lost!

20:10.627 --> 20:11.836
-You know, it's almost as if

20:11.878 --> 20:13.963
you're <i>meant</i>
to get lost in this place.

20:14.005 --> 20:16.299
- <i>Yes</i>.
That's what a labyrinth is!

20:16.341 --> 20:17.592
-Yeah?
-Yes!

20:17.634 --> 20:21.054
-Lucky we're not in
one of those then. [sighs]

20:21.096 --> 20:23.390
[all panting]

20:23.431 --> 20:24.557
-Look!

20:24.599 --> 20:26.434
There's light! We made it!

20:26.476 --> 20:29.062
-[all gasp]
-[slow clap]

20:29.104 --> 20:33.191
-So you finally decided
to start trying again.

20:33.233 --> 20:35.110
Took you long enough.

20:35.151 --> 20:37.153
-Okay, Mom. You were right.

20:37.195 --> 20:39.989
We were talking the talk
instead of walking the walk.

20:40.031 --> 20:42.867
-And even though
the warm springs
would have been lovely,

20:42.909 --> 20:45.912
Camp Thunder
is exactly what we needed.

20:45.954 --> 20:49.082
-Because you brought us here
and put our lives in danger

20:49.124 --> 20:52.752
to remind us
what thunder is all about.

20:52.794 --> 20:54.462
Wait, is that what happened?

20:54.504 --> 20:56.256
[giggling]

20:56.297 --> 20:58.133
-That's right, Sandy.
From now on,

20:58.174 --> 21:01.428
we're gonna bring the thunder
every time, no matter what.

21:01.469 --> 21:03.346
-Good. Camp Thunder worked.

21:03.388 --> 21:04.764
[grunting]

21:04.806 --> 21:06.433
Just like it always does.

21:06.474 --> 21:09.394
-Always?
You've done this before?
All of this?

21:09.436 --> 21:11.312
-Every time some Thunder Sisters

21:11.354 --> 21:13.440
got a little
too big for their pelts.

21:13.481 --> 21:15.442
Nothing like a few badgerillas

21:15.483 --> 21:17.444
to scare that thunder
back into you.

21:17.485 --> 21:19.988
-But, we could have been eaten!

21:20.030 --> 21:23.867
-Nah, you were fine.
Because you're Thunder Sisters!

21:23.908 --> 21:25.952
-Tell that to the Thunder
Sisters from your story.

21:25.994 --> 21:28.747
-That was just a story.
They were fine, too.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.999
-Yeah! I love a happy ending!

21:31.041 --> 21:31.958
[all sigh]

21:32.000 --> 21:33.960
-Before you start
your bellyaching

21:34.002 --> 21:36.963
like a bunch of crowverines
I supposedly poisoned,

21:37.005 --> 21:40.300
follow me.
I've got a surprise for you.

21:40.342 --> 21:43.386
-A surprise? [loud giggling]

21:43.428 --> 21:45.305
[straining]

21:45.347 --> 21:48.391
PHIL:
Higher! Lift me higher!

21:48.433 --> 21:49.476
I can almost taste freedom.

21:49.517 --> 21:51.186
-That's as high
as we can go, Phil!

21:51.227 --> 21:54.314
-[sighs] I guess we'll have to
wait for the others to return,

21:54.356 --> 21:57.525
but we'll be fine until then.

21:57.567 --> 21:59.486
-[growling]
-Or not.

21:59.527 --> 22:01.321
-Why'd you say that?!
What's wrong?!

22:01.363 --> 22:03.198
PHIL:
Wellions!

22:04.366 --> 22:06.159
ALL:
No!

22:06.201 --> 22:07.702
[silence]

22:08.453 --> 22:10.705
-Oh...

22:10.747 --> 22:13.166
Gran, I've already forgotten

22:13.208 --> 22:16.211
all the awful things
you did to us today.

22:16.252 --> 22:18.463
Thanks to these warm springs.

22:18.505 --> 22:20.840
-Camp Thunder is mostly stick,

22:20.882 --> 22:23.009
but there's also some carrot.

22:23.051 --> 22:24.552
-Can I hug you?

22:24.594 --> 22:27.347
-Not if you wanna keep that
skull mop of yours, Hairicane!

22:27.389 --> 22:28.890
* *

22:28.932 --> 22:32.352
-I gotta hand it to you, Mom.
This is quite a surprise.

22:32.394 --> 22:35.397
-Oh, no.
<i>This</i>isn't the surprise.

22:35.438 --> 22:38.108
-[screaming]
-[badgerillas roaring]

22:38.149 --> 22:40.026
<i>That's</i>the surprise.

22:40.068 --> 22:41.361
[roaring]

22:41.403 --> 22:44.698
*
