00:49.448 --> 00:52.785
They have the man advantage.
They're applying the pressure.

00:52.785 --> 00:57.831
It's Henderson behind the net,
fires it back to the point,

00:57.831 --> 01:00.417
Wilson with the shot,
Garrett makes the save.

01:00.417 --> 01:02.461
The puck is knocked
into the corner.

01:02.461 --> 01:05.589
Henderson digging for it,
gets it back to the point again.

01:05.589 --> 01:07.966
It's Weasel Wilson
winding up with a shot!

01:07.966 --> 01:10.636
He shoots! He scores!

01:10.803 --> 01:16.058
Weasel Wilson has given the Hawks
a 6-5 lead.

01:16.225 --> 01:19.394
The power play paid off
for the Waverly Hawks.

01:19.394 --> 01:21.480
They now have a one goal lead.

01:21.480 --> 01:23.941
The face-off comes back to centre ice.

01:23.941 --> 01:25.943
It's Morrison, winning the draw.

01:25.943 --> 01:29.780
Morrison takes the puck
to the blue line...

01:29.780 --> 01:32.407
Like most kids
growing up in Minnesota,

01:32.407 --> 01:34.785
I could skate before I could walk.

01:34.785 --> 01:37.204
So when my old coach
sent a call for help,

01:37.204 --> 01:39.873
I jumped at the chance
to come and coach his team

01:39.873 --> 01:43.418
through the state championship playoffs.

01:45.712 --> 01:49.883
The Raiders had fought hard to find
themselves in this best of three final

01:49.883 --> 01:52.010
against the Waverly Hawks.

01:52.010 --> 01:55.138
All I had to do
was keep them on track.

01:55.138 --> 01:56.973
Hockey was the easy part.

01:56.973 --> 01:59.267
The hard part was
the team's key player.

01:59.267 --> 02:02.145
Number 1 7, Derek Kirby.

02:02.312 --> 02:04.314
He was the team's biggest asset

02:04.314 --> 02:06.358
and my biggest problem.

02:06.358 --> 02:11.321
And as usual, right there
at home in the penalty box.

02:13.657 --> 02:17.577
...now only has
a few seconds remaining...

02:20.830 --> 02:23.875
Kirby dashing onto the ice,
skating over to his wing,

02:23.875 --> 02:26.961
indicating that he wants the pass.

02:28.922 --> 02:33.468
Kirby skating to the blue line,
takes the pass...

02:33.676 --> 02:36.304
Wrap it around!

02:36.471 --> 02:39.516
- Kirby shoots. He scores!
- Yes!

02:39.933 --> 02:44.312
Raiders goal scored
by Number 17, Derek Kirby.

02:44.479 --> 02:47.690
Back only four weeks
after the incident in Finland

02:47.690 --> 02:50.735
that led to his expulsion
from T eam USA.

02:50.735 --> 02:53.738
He's back! That's the way
to show 'em, Derek!

02:53.738 --> 02:56.199
Talk about winners
who like to perform...

02:56.199 --> 02:58.701
All right, we can do this!
We can do it!

02:58.701 --> 03:02.955
Leaving the ice for a moment, let's meet
a familiar face I spotted in the crowd.

03:02.955 --> 03:06.084
One of the top NHL player agents,
Bret Thompson.

03:06.084 --> 03:10.421
Is there anybody at ice level who has
the potential to play in the NHL?

03:10.421 --> 03:12.381
Kirby knows where to put the puck.

03:12.381 --> 03:15.009
He might be Mustang material.

03:15.051 --> 03:16.802
He's good, that's for sure.

03:16.802 --> 03:21.557
Thank you for joining us. You're going
to be busy the next couple of days.

03:21.557 --> 03:23.559
Kirby and Henderson on the...

03:23.559 --> 03:27.563
- What do you say?
- Hi, Bret. Watch your back!

03:27.563 --> 03:31.734
- Tension along the boards.
- Get off of him.

03:33.486 --> 03:35.154
Keep your head in the game!

03:35.154 --> 03:37.365
One goal could win it
for the team

03:37.365 --> 03:41.327
here in the state championship series.
It's the best of three.

03:41.327 --> 03:45.122
Play goes behind the net, Raiders
lose possession, the Hawks have it.

03:45.122 --> 03:49.502
Henderson, with the puck,
passing to Wilson in the slot.

03:49.502 --> 03:52.546
Kirby skates into Wilson...

03:52.713 --> 03:55.299
Seventeen, tripping.

03:56.842 --> 04:00.638
...and now Henderson retaliates
with a shot to the back of Kirby.

04:00.638 --> 04:01.764
This is serious.

04:01.764 --> 04:03.974
Sit down, all of you! Stay put.

04:03.974 --> 04:06.268
On the bench!
On the bench!

04:06.268 --> 04:10.105
...as a fight breaks out on the ice.
Pushing and shoving...

04:10.105 --> 04:12.149
Break it up!

04:12.149 --> 04:13.817
- You see that?
- Yeah.

04:13.817 --> 04:16.570
Okay, Kirby, that's it.
You're out of here!

04:16.570 --> 04:18.447
- Me?
- What about him?

04:18.447 --> 04:22.367
You have a lot of trouble finishing
a game, don't you, Mr Olympic?

04:22.367 --> 04:26.914
Team player Derek Kirby
has been ejected from this contest

04:26.914 --> 04:30.209
in an instant replay
of the exact infraction

04:30.209 --> 04:32.753
that got him expelled
from Team USA.

04:32.753 --> 04:36.632
What a blow to the Raiders
this will be with the scored tied

04:36.632 --> 04:38.759
and less than 30 seconds to play.

04:38.759 --> 04:41.428
Replacement coach MacGyver
doesn't appear happy.

04:41.428 --> 04:46.141
Raider penalty, number 17, Kirby,
a game misconduct.

04:47.517 --> 04:52.022
The Hawks are on the power play once
again, with the score tied at six all.

04:52.022 --> 04:54.900
Kirby makes his way
to the dressing room.

04:54.900 --> 04:59.112
As the play continues now,
Henderson gets it back to the point,

04:59.112 --> 05:03.700
across to Wilson, back to Henderson,
Henderson winds up with a shot,

05:03.700 --> 05:06.912
Henderson shoots. He scores!

05:19.007 --> 05:21.593
All right!

05:21.635 --> 05:24.220
7-6, Hawks.

05:24.262 --> 05:26.890
Hawks are number one, Kirby.

05:27.599 --> 05:30.977
Forget it. These jokers don't know
what the game's all about.

05:30.977 --> 05:34.105
Some refs throw you out
just for breaking a fingernail.

05:34.105 --> 05:38.735
Yeah, and some do it when you try to get
away with a dangerous stunt like Derek.

05:38.735 --> 05:41.362
Mr Thompson, this is MacGyver.

05:41.362 --> 05:46.034
He's coaching the Raiders for
Turk Donner while Turk's laid up.

05:46.034 --> 05:48.703
Bret is a player's rep,

05:48.870 --> 05:51.039
in case you didn't know that.

05:51.039 --> 05:53.750
He's trying to set up my boy
for the Mustangs.

05:53.750 --> 05:55.877
From the way Derek played tonight,

05:55.877 --> 05:58.504
I'd say he's the material
they're looking for.

05:58.504 --> 06:02.884
Yeah, well Mustang material
is not what I'm looking for.

06:02.884 --> 06:05.887
You didn't get away with
banging heads for Team USA,

06:05.887 --> 06:09.974
you're not gonna get away with it
playing for the Raiders.

06:09.974 --> 06:12.268
You try something like that again,

06:12.268 --> 06:16.147
I'll can you myself.
State finals or not.

06:17.815 --> 06:20.735
Practice, 2.00 sharp. Be there.

06:23.029 --> 06:27.199
Who the hell does he think he is
mouthing off to you like that?

06:27.199 --> 06:29.660
- Telling you what to do.
- Come on, Pop.

06:29.660 --> 06:32.455
- He's just thinking of the team.
- Oh, MacGyver...

06:32.455 --> 06:33.998
Don't worry about it.

06:33.998 --> 06:37.501
If I can get the Mustang coaches
to fly down for the next game,

06:37.501 --> 06:39.545
and you play the
way you did tonight,

06:39.545 --> 06:43.841
well, you can kiss this little hick town
goodbye forever.

06:43.841 --> 06:46.469
All right, Bret.

07:10.367 --> 07:13.120
- We lost.
- I know.

07:14.913 --> 07:16.498
Where did you get this?

07:16.498 --> 07:18.250
I have my connections.

07:18.250 --> 07:20.294
The doctor said no excitement.

07:20.294 --> 07:23.213
Doctor's been saying that
for six weeks.

07:23.213 --> 07:25.799
I just wish she'd let
the boys come and see me.

07:25.799 --> 07:29.136
Will you take it easy?
Your health comes first.

07:29.136 --> 07:33.182
No, the championship comes first.
That's why you're here, MacGyver.

07:33.182 --> 07:35.434
- And I appreciate it.
- Hey, whoa.

07:35.434 --> 07:38.270
We're down to a two-game season.
We got to win both.

07:38.270 --> 07:40.564
Right, and Derek's our only chance.

07:40.564 --> 07:44.818
You're the coach now.
You have to do something with him.

07:44.818 --> 07:47.487
How about canning him for starters?

07:47.487 --> 07:51.783
For every goal he scored, he spent
four to six minutes in the penalty box.

07:51.783 --> 07:55.287
What did you see in him
to think he was Olympic material?

07:55.287 --> 07:59.374
I saw the next Gretzky,
maybe better.

07:59.541 --> 08:03.712
He's got that fire inside him,
something that can make him a champion.

08:03.712 --> 08:07.966
That same something you
took to the Olympics in 1 960?

08:07.966 --> 08:12.220
I see a little bit of me in the kid.
But I also see a whole lot of you.

08:12.220 --> 08:15.265
He has what you had when I
coached you in high school.

08:15.265 --> 08:18.727
All he needs is someone
to clear a path for him.

08:18.727 --> 08:22.647
To show him the way.
And you can do that, I know you can.

08:22.647 --> 08:26.443
This means more than
winning a championship, doesn't it?

08:26.443 --> 08:30.739
Folks around here could use something
to stand up and be proud of.

08:30.739 --> 08:35.534
And you can give it to them, MacGyver,
but it starts with Derek Kirby.

08:35.534 --> 08:38.163
You gotta turn him around.

09:01.436 --> 09:04.564
Stupid compressor.

09:04.731 --> 09:07.233
- Derek's not here.
- I came to talk to you.

09:07.233 --> 09:08.484
Yeah, so talk.

09:08.484 --> 09:11.904
Talk all you want, I don't care.

09:12.071 --> 09:17.744
I want you to keep Thompson
and the Mustangs away from Derek.

09:18.911 --> 09:20.788
You gotta be kidding. What for?

09:20.788 --> 09:24.709
So your son can play
the right brand of hockey.

09:24.709 --> 09:27.420
I don't wanna see the team
lose the championship

09:27.420 --> 09:31.090
just so Derek can showboat his way
into a contract with those goons.

09:31.090 --> 09:34.802
You got it figured out pretty good,
don't you?

09:34.802 --> 09:38.639
I want to show you something
about the right brand of hockey.

09:38.639 --> 09:41.475
This trophy here.
He won that when he was 1 4.

09:41.475 --> 09:43.728
Most valuable player.

09:43.728 --> 09:47.481
Ninety-seven goals, 1 1 2 assists.
And guess what?

09:47.481 --> 09:53.362
He won it without you holding his hand.
Think about that, hotshot.

09:53.362 --> 09:56.407
I think an Olympic medal
might have looked good in here.

09:56.407 --> 09:59.785
Yeah, I thought about that, I did.

09:59.952 --> 10:04.665
Until they put an Olympic torch
in my son's hands

10:04.832 --> 10:06.667
and then burned him with it.

10:06.667 --> 10:10.546
Mr Kirby, don't you think Derek
had just a little to do with that?

10:10.546 --> 10:14.466
Why? Because my boy
plays hard-nose hockey?

10:14.466 --> 10:16.719
- Because my kid plays to win?
- No.

10:16.719 --> 10:20.472
Because he ignores
basic rules of hockey.

10:20.472 --> 10:24.810
And he doesn't give a thought
about the team or teamwork.

10:24.810 --> 10:27.896
Derek has nothing resembling
Olympic spirit.

10:27.896 --> 10:31.066
Don't you tell me about Olympic spirit.

10:31.066 --> 10:33.527
I've seen my boy cry twice in his life.

10:33.527 --> 10:35.737
Once when his mama died,

10:35.737 --> 10:39.241
and the other time was when
he got off that plane from Finland.

10:39.241 --> 10:41.243
I won't see him hurt that way again.

10:41.243 --> 10:43.996
I'll do everything in my power,
everything I can,

10:43.996 --> 10:46.415
to see he gets something decent
in his life.

10:46.415 --> 10:50.627
And it's hockey, man.
I mean it's professional hockey.

10:50.627 --> 10:53.922
- That's the only way he will get it.
- Get what?

10:53.922 --> 10:56.383
A big paycheck for being a hitman
on skates?

10:56.383 --> 10:58.343
That's all they're looking for.

10:58.343 --> 11:02.055
At least it's a chance for something
better than this, right?

11:02.055 --> 11:05.267
Let me tell you something, MacGyver,

11:05.267 --> 11:08.353
you get in the way of that,
and so help me, I...

11:08.353 --> 11:12.691
Don't say it, Mr Kirby.
Please. Don't say it.

11:17.028 --> 11:19.656
Thanks for your time.

11:40.301 --> 11:42.929
Lean low, hard on net and...

11:56.651 --> 11:59.279
Nice shot!

12:00.864 --> 12:02.907
Need a soapbox to shoot from, Kirby?

12:02.907 --> 12:05.159
You got something to say, Chester?

12:05.159 --> 12:08.121
Your hot-dogging for the Mustangs
cost us the game.

12:08.121 --> 12:09.414
Hey! Can it, you guys!

12:09.414 --> 12:11.416
- Shut your face.
- Make me do it!

12:11.416 --> 12:12.959
- You want to try me?
- Yeah.

12:12.959 --> 12:16.754
Come on! Come on, let's do it.
Show me!

12:16.838 --> 12:19.841
- Hey, guys.
- Come on, cool it, would you?

12:19.841 --> 12:21.926
Knock it off.

12:21.926 --> 12:24.554
Come on!

12:25.972 --> 12:28.558
Back off.

12:28.724 --> 12:31.310
Knock it off, both of you!

12:32.145 --> 12:34.230
We win as a team,
and we lose as a team.

12:34.230 --> 12:37.733
That's the way it works!
You got it?

12:38.901 --> 12:44.490
All right, set up for the fishhook.
We'll run it as a team.

13:00.047 --> 13:02.675
All right, set it up.

13:09.932 --> 13:12.518
Run the boards, Morrison.

13:13.686 --> 13:16.313
That's it! Now move it!

13:16.480 --> 13:19.108
Now bring it out, Malachuk.

13:23.904 --> 13:26.532
Set it!

13:28.951 --> 13:30.369
Pass it, Kirby!

13:30.369 --> 13:33.914
Watch the interference.
Get it to him!

13:34.998 --> 13:38.252
All right.
That's working together.

13:42.881 --> 13:45.467
Okay, again.

13:46.301 --> 13:49.972
Esposito's got it on centre ice,
into the corner to Sanderson, to Orr,

13:49.972 --> 13:52.975
coming down the slot,
he shoots. Off the pipe.

13:52.975 --> 13:56.061
It's out front! Lanny McDonald
shoots, scores!

13:56.061 --> 13:58.355
Unbelievable, off the face mask.

13:58.355 --> 14:01.608
- Great shot.
- You got any more quarters?

14:01.608 --> 14:05.654
No, you've totally cleaned me out,
come on.

14:05.862 --> 14:08.699
You really love hockey, don't you?

14:08.699 --> 14:11.576
Yeah. I love it a lot.

14:11.743 --> 14:13.912
So, what got you turned on to it?

14:13.912 --> 14:16.706
Growing up in Minnesota,
it's kind of hard not to,

14:16.706 --> 14:20.794
but right there,
that's what did it for me.

14:22.129 --> 14:24.297
It's Turk Donner's gold medal.

14:24.297 --> 14:28.760
Squaw Valley, 1 960.
Turk and his team beat the Czechs.

14:28.760 --> 14:32.222
I was eight, and I still remember him
bringing home that medal.

14:32.222 --> 14:35.183
I couldn't wait to get into high school
to play for him.

14:35.183 --> 14:36.559
Yeah.

14:36.559 --> 14:39.229
Coach Donner's the reason
I made Team USA.

14:39.229 --> 14:44.025
No, your ability to play hockey
is what got you on the team.

14:44.025 --> 14:49.781
The question is, how did you
get yourself kicked off the team?

14:50.281 --> 14:52.784
No secret there.

14:52.784 --> 14:54.828
The whole country saw it.

14:54.828 --> 14:59.332
That steamroller on Team Finland took
me to the boards, I gave it back to him.

14:59.332 --> 15:03.503
- End of story.
- That's not what I'm talking about.

15:03.503 --> 15:07.465
I want to know what went on
in your head.

15:08.341 --> 15:12.595
Derek, you've got the talent.
You've got the speed, the instinct.

15:12.595 --> 15:16.474
You know that.
You don't have to bang heads to win.

15:16.474 --> 15:20.770
Know what it's like to be chosen from
400 of the best players in the country?

15:20.770 --> 15:24.941
- I wish I did.
- They only picked 32 of us.

15:24.941 --> 15:27.652
God, my dad was proud.

15:27.819 --> 15:29.612
I got a letter from the governor,

15:29.612 --> 15:34.200
congratulating me
as an ambassador of sportsmanship.

15:34.200 --> 15:38.579
Dad borrowed money from the bank
to throw me this big send-off party.

15:38.579 --> 15:41.624
Filled this place to the rafters.

15:41.791 --> 15:47.255
Then I blew my chance at the Olympics
by playing the only hockey I know.

15:47.255 --> 15:50.758
I've got to go for that NHL contract,
MacGyver.

15:50.758 --> 15:52.885
I can't let my dad down again.

15:52.885 --> 15:54.595
That's great!

15:54.595 --> 15:57.348
Go for the NHL.

15:57.515 --> 16:01.602
But, Derek, make a team pick you
for the right reasons.

16:01.602 --> 16:05.606
Make them pick you for your abilities
as a hockey player, not a fighter.

16:05.606 --> 16:08.317
It's all I can do, MacGyver.

16:08.484 --> 16:12.154
- Hockey's in my blood.
- I understand that.

16:12.154 --> 16:15.574
Just take the blood
out of your hockey.

16:15.574 --> 16:17.076
Doesn't it say something

16:17.076 --> 16:20.871
when the only team
to show any interest in you at all

16:20.871 --> 16:24.750
is a team with a fairly bad reputation?

16:24.917 --> 16:29.171
- You can do better than that, Derek.
- Derek.

16:30.005 --> 16:32.132
Let's go, buddy.

16:32.132 --> 16:34.718
We've got work to do.

16:35.427 --> 16:38.055
I gotta go.

16:38.847 --> 16:43.977
Why don't you save your coaching
for the ice, MacGyver?

16:51.485 --> 16:54.321
Welcome to Kerrisdale Arena
for game two

16:54.321 --> 16:56.657
of the Minnesota college championship.

16:56.657 --> 17:00.661
Face-off is just minutes away,
here on KLMA.

17:00.661 --> 17:03.580
620 AM radio, your voice of hockey.

17:03.580 --> 17:07.960
In exciting game one of the series
the Hawks scored in the final seconds

17:07.960 --> 17:11.713
to beat the Raiders 7-6, that
was after Raiders' star Derek Kirby

17:11.713 --> 17:14.925
was ejected from the game
for an intent to injure penalty.

17:14.925 --> 17:18.845
Kirby's a factor keeping the Hawks
from walking off with the championship.

17:18.845 --> 17:20.680
The former Team USA player

17:20.680 --> 17:24.392
has racked up a record 1 80 minutes
of penalties this season

17:24.392 --> 17:27.561
and yet, still leads in goals with 55.

17:27.561 --> 17:31.900
Had Kirby stuck around in game one,
it might have been a different story.

17:31.900 --> 17:36.738
The puck is dropped. Game two in this
best of three series is underway.

17:36.738 --> 17:40.992
The Raiders take possession
and pass down the right side.

17:40.992 --> 17:45.497
The all important second game
and Kirby has got the play in this one.

17:45.497 --> 17:49.501
You can tell he really wants the puck
at every opportunity.

17:49.501 --> 17:52.253
Kirby takes it to the blue line,
now to the end court.

17:52.253 --> 17:57.550
This could be the patented
wraparound move, and he scores!

17:58.426 --> 18:00.845
Lightning speed in game two

18:00.845 --> 18:04.224
to give the Raiders
an early one-nothing lead!

18:04.224 --> 18:06.684
As I said, Kirby has come to play,

18:06.684 --> 18:10.104
and he used that move
where he goes around the net,

18:10.104 --> 18:12.398
and then tucks it in the short side.

18:12.398 --> 18:15.568
Oh, what a beauty that was
from Derek Kirby,

18:15.568 --> 18:18.112
to give the Raiders
a one-nothing lead,

18:18.112 --> 18:21.824
in this all important
second game of the series.

18:21.824 --> 18:26.162
That's the psychological lift
that the Raiders were looking for.

18:26.162 --> 18:28.206
The replacement coach MacGyver

18:28.206 --> 18:31.459
seems to have really worked wonders
with his star centre.

18:31.459 --> 18:34.045
Or is Kirby trying to earn his ticket
to the NHL

18:34.045 --> 18:39.342
by impressing those two Mustang coaches
sitting with his dad in the stands?

18:39.342 --> 18:42.011
And now the Raiders
come out of their own zone.

18:42.011 --> 18:45.473
They've got a two on two situation
as they hit the blue line,

18:45.473 --> 18:48.267
and shoot the puck in.
Kirby has the puck.

18:48.267 --> 18:51.187
He drives toward the end boards,
stops, turns around,

18:51.187 --> 18:54.315
comes back to the point,
now he's picking up speed,

18:54.315 --> 18:56.025
driving towards the net...

18:56.025 --> 19:00.237
Kirby taking a vicious cross check
from Wilson!

19:00.237 --> 19:02.865
Call it, ref!

19:02.907 --> 19:06.702
Fourteen Hawks.
Cross-checking. Let's go.

19:09.789 --> 19:13.000
Don't just lie there, get up, son!

19:13.417 --> 19:16.253
Maybe he's hurt,
maybe he's really shaken up.

19:16.253 --> 19:18.839
No! Kirby is back on his skates.

19:18.839 --> 19:22.718
Clock is stopped with two minutes
eight seconds remaining in the period.

19:22.718 --> 19:25.304
The score still Raiders three,
Hawks one.

19:25.304 --> 19:28.140
Two of those Raider goals
coming from Derek Kirby,

19:28.140 --> 19:32.019
who surprisingly enough,
has yet to receive a single penalty.

19:32.019 --> 19:33.395
Way to go, MacGyver!

19:33.395 --> 19:35.981
Fourteen Hawks, two minutes.
Cross-checking.

19:35.981 --> 19:40.152
Hawks penalty, number 14, Wilson.
Cross-checking. Two minutes.

19:40.152 --> 19:43.322
Kirby is happy, the Raiders
have the man advantage.

19:43.322 --> 19:47.242
And this is a key face-off
just inside the Hawk's blue line.

19:47.242 --> 19:50.412
Kirby and the Raiders are set,
they lose the face-off.

19:50.412 --> 19:54.124
The Hawks get possession.
They play it behind their own net.

19:54.124 --> 19:57.461
The pass off through centre ice
right to the stick of Kirby.

19:57.461 --> 19:58.962
Kirby in his own blue line.

19:58.962 --> 20:03.217
He wheels, passes to himself!
What a great move by Derek Kirby!

20:03.217 --> 20:06.303
A bit of a showboating move,
but it certainly worked,

20:06.303 --> 20:08.388
as Kirby passes to Malachuk.

20:08.388 --> 20:11.892
Malachuk... He's got a man
open behind the net.

20:11.892 --> 20:14.645
Malachuk plays it around the boards.

20:14.645 --> 20:17.773
Raiders still have possession.
Back to Kirby at the point.

20:17.773 --> 20:20.776
Kirby, wheeling and dealing
just inside the blue line.

20:20.776 --> 20:23.403
- Set it up!
- Looking for somebody to pass to.

20:23.403 --> 20:28.033
- The Raiders have the man advantage.
- Let's go, boy!

20:28.033 --> 20:30.994
Kirby, still looking
for somebody to pass to.

20:30.994 --> 20:32.871
He's gonna make his move.

20:32.871 --> 20:36.625
But he's not passing it,
hanging onto the puck.

20:36.625 --> 20:41.129
- Kirby is looking into the stands.
- Kirby, what are you doing?

20:41.129 --> 20:45.967
I can't believe it! He's showboating
for the fans, and the pros.

20:45.967 --> 20:48.345
He fakes the shot,
moves in towards the net.

20:48.345 --> 20:51.514
He's got an open lane,
but again he won't shoot!

20:51.514 --> 20:54.684
- And he won't pass...
- Stop the hot-dogging!

20:54.684 --> 20:57.228
Neat move by Kirby
to get by the defenseman,

20:57.228 --> 20:59.564
and he still won't pass the puck!

20:59.564 --> 21:01.691
He's got players open
all over the ice.

21:01.691 --> 21:05.320
Henderson moves in and
steals the puck away from Kirby.

21:05.320 --> 21:07.405
It's a two on one break!

21:07.405 --> 21:09.949
It's Baxter and Henderson.

21:09.949 --> 21:13.077
Henderson with the puck,
lays it to Baxter.

21:13.077 --> 21:15.580
Baxter shoots, he scores!

21:15.580 --> 21:19.334
Unbelievable!
A bad move on the part of Kirby.

21:19.334 --> 21:24.422
He held on to the puck far too long,
and it cost the Raiders.

21:24.422 --> 21:28.843
- Henderson poke-checked it free.
- Damn it, no!

21:30.887 --> 21:34.891
Turk, I told you, no hockey.
No excitement.

21:35.058 --> 21:38.311
Wait, are you telling me that I'm
getting out of here in a week,

21:38.311 --> 21:40.605
and I can't listen
to a game on the radio?

21:40.605 --> 21:43.983
If that's what you're telling me,
pull the plug right now.

21:43.983 --> 21:48.070
The first thing I'm gonna do when I
get out of here is find a hockey game.

21:48.070 --> 21:50.281
I don't care if it's
pee-wees on a pond!

21:50.281 --> 21:53.534
You are a real big pain,
you know that?

21:53.534 --> 21:56.120
Of course I know that.

22:00.458 --> 22:02.793
- What's the score?
- We're up by one.

22:02.793 --> 22:05.880
Pull up a bed, doc, and sit down.

22:05.880 --> 22:07.465
How's Kirby doing?

22:07.465 --> 22:10.718
He'd be in the dressing room about now,
and if I were MacGyver,

22:10.718 --> 22:15.139
I'd be saying to him, "Why didn't you
follow the play? Johnson was wide open!"

22:15.139 --> 22:18.642
Why didn't you follow the play, Kirby?
Johnson was wide open.

22:18.642 --> 22:20.644
I lost it, all right?

22:20.644 --> 22:22.688
No, it's not all right.

22:22.688 --> 22:25.483
They scored because you
didn't follow a play.

22:25.483 --> 22:28.194
The play we set up as a team.

22:28.194 --> 22:32.907
You want to play for the Mustangs? Fine.
But you wait until you're on their team!

22:32.907 --> 22:35.451
You got it?

22:35.451 --> 22:37.912
I got it. I'm sorry.

22:37.912 --> 22:40.497
Okay, two minutes, Raiders.

22:40.914 --> 22:44.335
All right, we've got 20 minutes left
to do it.

22:44.335 --> 22:46.920
Let's go!

23:01.268 --> 23:06.899
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
for the third period, your Raiders!

23:12.404 --> 23:15.782
- What do you call that out there?
- Just let me play, okay?

23:15.782 --> 23:17.451
You'd better start playing.

23:17.451 --> 23:20.454
I mean I want to see
some hard and fast action.

23:20.454 --> 23:24.791
I didn't haul Mustang coaches here
to watch you try out for Ice Capades.

23:24.791 --> 23:27.085
We can't win with me
in the penalty box.

23:27.085 --> 23:29.129
Who cares if you win?

23:29.129 --> 23:32.132
You're making a fool out of me,
and your old man.

23:32.132 --> 23:36.219
I want some hard-nose hockey that's
gonna prove you're Mustang material.

23:36.219 --> 23:40.348
You got 20 minutes to
go out there and bash some heads.

23:40.348 --> 23:43.226
Hey, let's go. Get on the ice.

23:44.644 --> 23:47.230
You're off limits, Thompson.

23:48.648 --> 23:52.569
The third period about to get underway
here at the Kerrisdale Arena,

23:52.569 --> 23:55.322
the Raiders continue to lead
by a score of 3-2,

23:55.322 --> 23:57.949
but in the best of three
championship series,

23:57.949 --> 24:00.076
they trail one game to nothing.

24:00.076 --> 24:02.787
On the face-off,
the Raiders win the draw.

24:02.787 --> 24:06.041
They get it back to Malachuk.
Malachuk to Johnson.

24:06.041 --> 24:09.043
Johnson ahead to Kirby.
Kirby spots Randar on the right.

24:09.043 --> 24:12.547
Randar with a break.
He shoots! It's wide on the mark.

24:12.547 --> 24:17.343
Kirby goes over to the boards
and he's hit heavily by Henderson.

24:17.343 --> 24:20.305
There's no love lost
between these two players.

24:20.305 --> 24:23.766
But once again,
Kirby refuses to retaliate.

24:23.766 --> 24:27.103
He backs away.
That's unusual for the feisty Kirby.

24:27.103 --> 24:29.439
- Bust him one, son!
- Most times he'd fight.

24:29.439 --> 24:33.484
- Let him have it!
- Seems confused, unsure of himself.

24:33.484 --> 24:37.739
Kirby moving into the...
He trips Henderson!

24:37.905 --> 24:40.074
- Kirby, no!
- A flagrant penalty.

24:40.074 --> 24:43.202
A tripping penalty
if ever there was one.

24:43.202 --> 24:47.415
Kirby against Henderson.
Henderson moves in to shove Kirby.

24:47.415 --> 24:50.626
Now the gloves are off,
the helmets are down on the ice,

24:50.626 --> 24:53.337
these two are going at it.
There's no love lost.

24:53.337 --> 24:55.882
On the bench! Stay on the bench!

24:55.882 --> 24:58.593
Henderson and Kirby going at it.

24:58.593 --> 25:03.014
Henderson is taking a couple
of sharp lefts from Kirby.

25:03.014 --> 25:06.017
Come on, Derek!
Give it to him!

25:07.435 --> 25:12.273
- Had enough?
- And now, Kirby shoves Henderson.

25:31.292 --> 25:33.919
Better call the paramedics.

26:10.789 --> 26:14.042
- He's still in a coma.
- Have his parents been notified?

26:14.042 --> 26:17.713
- His mother's arriving in the morning.
- Will he be all right?

26:17.713 --> 26:20.465
The blow to the head
caused a skull fracture

26:20.465 --> 26:23.010
and there's haemorrhaging
around the brain.

26:23.010 --> 26:25.721
Depending on how long it takes him
to come around,

26:25.721 --> 26:28.807
well, he could be disabled.

26:28.974 --> 26:31.560
Disabled?

26:35.897 --> 26:40.277
I'm gonna check in on Turk,
let him know what's happening.

26:40.277 --> 26:43.196
- You all right?
- Yeah.

26:59.921 --> 27:02.507
I'm sorry, Eddie.

27:04.467 --> 27:07.637
Nobody was supposed to get hurt.

27:18.857 --> 27:20.316
Hey!

27:20.316 --> 27:23.987
Stop! What are you doing?
Take it easy.

27:27.407 --> 27:33.371
Hey, son, you can't let
what happened to Eddie get to you.

27:33.538 --> 27:36.124
That was an accident.

27:36.416 --> 27:39.043
His head is mush.

27:39.043 --> 27:43.047
They can't just bang out the dents
and give him a new paint job.

27:43.047 --> 27:45.341
He's as good as dead and it's my fault.

27:45.341 --> 27:48.010
Come on now.

27:48.177 --> 27:51.639
Did you tell Eddie to pick a fight?
Did you tell him that?

27:51.639 --> 27:55.601
Did you tell Eddie
to take off his helmet?

27:56.769 --> 27:58.020
No.

27:58.020 --> 28:01.899
Well, then don't eat yourself up
over it.

28:02.650 --> 28:06.237
I know you're hurting, son.
I mean, I can see that.

28:06.237 --> 28:08.906
But punishing yourself
isn't going to...

28:08.906 --> 28:11.617
...change anything, right?

28:11.784 --> 28:15.037
He's tough, like me.

28:15.204 --> 28:18.958
- Hey, Walt, Derek.
- Hey, Bret.

28:19.125 --> 28:22.294
Well, break out the champagne.

28:22.461 --> 28:24.588
You are in.

28:24.588 --> 28:27.842
Congratulations. Welcome
to the Mustangs and big leagues.

28:27.842 --> 28:31.220
- The coaches went for him?
- Are you kidding? They ate him up!

28:31.220 --> 28:33.389
Way to go.
I knew you'd come through.

28:33.389 --> 28:37.143
- So when does he start, Bret?
- Your first game is in Philly tomorrow.

28:37.143 --> 28:40.563
The owners can't wait to see you
take a notch out of the Fliers.

28:40.563 --> 28:43.232
Look here.
What do you think, huh?

28:43.232 --> 28:47.236
- Tomorrow?
- You guys move fast, I gotta tell you.

28:47.236 --> 28:50.030
What about the Raiders
and the state finals?

28:50.030 --> 28:51.782
You want to risk an injury?

28:51.782 --> 28:54.952
Blow a six-figure deal
over a lousy state trophy?

28:54.952 --> 28:58.455
- Come on. It's only one more game.
- I had to nail them to their seats

28:58.455 --> 29:00.791
after the second period
to get them to stay.

29:00.791 --> 29:04.795
If you hadn't come through in the third,
you'd be history. Don't push it.

29:04.795 --> 29:06.380
Wait a minute.

29:06.380 --> 29:08.841
If I hadn't put Eddie in the hospital,

29:08.841 --> 29:11.677
the Mustangs wouldn't have
anything to do with me?

29:11.677 --> 29:13.929
You're starting to sound like MacGyver.

29:13.929 --> 29:16.557
It's my question. Answer me.

29:17.099 --> 29:18.433
What is this?

29:18.433 --> 29:20.936
I bust my butt
to get you on an NHL team.

29:20.936 --> 29:24.606
Now you want to play 20 Questions?
Either you're in, or you're out.

29:24.606 --> 29:28.360
Don't worry about it.
You got yourself a deal.

29:28.360 --> 29:30.737
The hell he does!

29:30.737 --> 29:33.740
I don't want your blood money.
Get out of here.

29:33.740 --> 29:35.534
Have it your way, kid.

29:35.534 --> 29:39.204
- Hey, come on, Bret.
- No, I've wasted enough time here.

29:39.204 --> 29:42.165
The name comes off the jersey
just as easy it went on.

29:42.165 --> 29:44.751
Give us another chance.

29:50.507 --> 29:52.634
Are you nuts?

29:52.634 --> 29:55.387
Do you realize what you just did?

29:55.387 --> 29:58.098
What I should have done
when I got back from Finland.

29:58.098 --> 30:01.059
What the hell are you talking about?

30:01.059 --> 30:02.978
- I'm quitting.
- Derek...

30:02.978 --> 30:06.273
The Mustangs, the Raiders,
the whole works.

30:06.273 --> 30:07.857
I can't do this anymore.

30:07.857 --> 30:10.443
You can't just up
and throw it all away.

30:10.443 --> 30:13.279
- You wanted this your whole life.
- No!

30:13.279 --> 30:16.366
- You wanted it!
- Me? I wanted it?

30:16.366 --> 30:19.244
I had you in a half-nelson
since you were eight?

30:19.244 --> 30:20.829
You didn't want any of this?

30:20.829 --> 30:23.832
The medals, the championships,
all these trophies?

30:23.832 --> 30:26.000
You didn't want any of this stuff?

30:26.000 --> 30:28.628
No!

30:35.343 --> 30:39.430
What kind of trophy do I get
if Eddie dies?

30:41.057 --> 30:43.643
I'm finished.

30:44.978 --> 30:47.230
No more.

30:47.230 --> 30:49.273
I'm finished too!

30:49.273 --> 30:52.777
You hear me?
Finished with all of it!

31:36.237 --> 31:38.823
- You're late.
- I know. Sorry.

31:38.823 --> 31:43.160
Kirby's in the dressing room.
He says he's quitting.

31:43.160 --> 31:46.622
- Take over.
- Okay, let's go.

31:57.549 --> 32:00.761
So when the going gets tough,

32:00.928 --> 32:04.139
the tough quit.
Is that it, Derek?

32:04.932 --> 32:06.767
I've had it, MacGyver.

32:06.767 --> 32:09.770
I don't know who to play
the game for anymore.

32:09.770 --> 32:12.773
If I play the way you want me to,
my dad's all over me

32:12.773 --> 32:15.484
and I lose a contract
with the Mustangs.

32:15.484 --> 32:20.531
If I play the way they want,
I practically kill Eddie.

32:22.491 --> 32:25.160
I'm finished.

32:25.327 --> 32:27.913
It just isn't fun anymore.

32:38.090 --> 32:40.676
So, what happens now?

32:40.884 --> 32:43.220
I don't know.

32:43.220 --> 32:47.099
Finish college.
Get a job someplace, I guess.

32:47.099 --> 32:51.269
And wonder for the rest of your life
if you could have made it or not?

32:51.269 --> 32:54.272
What do you suppose Eddie's
wondering about?

32:54.272 --> 32:57.859
Quitting is not going to change
what happened to Eddie.

32:57.859 --> 33:02.197
If you got out there and showed people
the way the game should be played,

33:02.197 --> 33:03.573
that wouldn't happen.

33:03.573 --> 33:06.910
Look, MacGyver,
you don't have a clue how I feel.

33:06.910 --> 33:10.080
I know how you will feel
about ten or 1 5 years down the line.

33:10.080 --> 33:12.916
What is this? Another pep talk?

33:13.083 --> 33:15.835
Trust me. It's no pep talk.

33:17.629 --> 33:20.757
When I got out of high school,
I could taste the Olympics,

33:20.757 --> 33:22.967
and a pro career in hockey.

33:22.967 --> 33:25.136
Then I managed to
get myself busted up.

33:25.136 --> 33:28.056
- How?
- Playing hard, playing stupid.

33:28.056 --> 33:30.433
The point is,
my injuries were bad enough

33:30.433 --> 33:34.521
that I convinced myself
that it just wasn't worth it.

33:34.521 --> 33:37.148
And I quit.

33:37.732 --> 33:40.985
And now every time I lace up
my skates and go out on that ice,

33:40.985 --> 33:45.240
I gotta wonder whether I
could have made it or not.

33:45.240 --> 33:50.203
And you know something, Derek?
I'll never find out.

33:50.370 --> 33:53.539
You don't get many
second chances, Derek.

33:53.539 --> 33:56.918
Don't make the same mistake I did.

33:57.085 --> 34:00.838
Because if you quit, that's it.

34:01.005 --> 34:03.591
You'll always wonder.

34:23.069 --> 34:26.030
Let's go, set it up, all right?

34:26.781 --> 34:29.492
Move! Come to me, George.

34:29.659 --> 34:31.619
Coming to you, Garrett.

34:31.619 --> 34:34.246
That's it! Next three, move!

34:34.496 --> 34:36.248
Come on, let's go!

34:36.248 --> 34:38.042
Stay on him, stay on him.

34:38.042 --> 34:40.628
Next three.

34:41.754 --> 34:44.380
I got him, I got him!

34:45.299 --> 34:47.885
It's going around.

35:02.024 --> 35:05.611
Look, I've been pretty mixed up lately.

35:09.323 --> 35:13.202
I was trying to please everybody and...

35:13.369 --> 35:16.955
...I forgot what was best for the team.

35:17.831 --> 35:20.417
I let you guys down.

35:21.543 --> 35:24.171
I'm sorry.

35:30.802 --> 35:35.224
I won't blame you
if you don't want me back...

35:35.224 --> 35:41.605
...but we've got a good shot at winning
that state championship tomorrow night.

35:41.605 --> 35:45.442
- I hope you'll let me be a part of it.
- Is this you talking, Derek?

35:45.442 --> 35:49.654
Or are you just setting up another
a dog and pony show for your dad?

35:49.654 --> 35:54.117
He's... He's out of the picture.

35:54.284 --> 35:56.870
For good.

36:06.755 --> 36:10.217
All right! Let's run it again.

36:11.509 --> 36:14.387
Next three up. Here we go!

36:41.998 --> 36:44.584
That old compressor again?

36:44.709 --> 36:50.715
- Let me give you a hand there.
- I've had enough help from you.

37:00.558 --> 37:02.101
Now there's your problem.

37:02.101 --> 37:05.229
The spring. Oh, that's terrific.

37:05.396 --> 37:07.815
I'll order a new one,
take a month to get here.

37:07.815 --> 37:10.443
Oh, maybe not.

37:15.072 --> 37:17.700
You know, when something's broken,

37:17.700 --> 37:23.789
the easiest thing to do is just
throw it away or forget about it.

37:28.586 --> 37:33.466
But if you just step back,
take a look at what you got,

37:33.466 --> 37:39.055
sometimes you find a totally
different way of making it work.

37:44.018 --> 37:46.145
Try that.

37:46.145 --> 37:50.357
Seems like you got a knack
for fixing things.

37:51.192 --> 37:54.528
There is one thing I'd really like
to be able to fix, Mr Kirby.

37:54.528 --> 37:57.323
The split between you and your son.

37:57.323 --> 37:59.783
Well, he didn't come home last night.

37:59.783 --> 38:02.870
That doesn't surprise me.

38:03.037 --> 38:05.080
He's not quitting.

38:05.080 --> 38:08.792
- He's going to play tonight.
- Tonight?

38:09.668 --> 38:15.591
All right. Well, let me tell you
about the last 12 years, Mr MacGyver.

38:15.591 --> 38:20.429
The long drives on icy roads
to games and practices.

38:20.596 --> 38:24.433
Watching your eight year old
take a frozen puck to the face.

38:24.433 --> 38:28.562
And holding his hand
while they sewed up his chin.

38:28.562 --> 38:32.566
And the hockey clinics every summer.
Every summer, 1 500 bucks a throw.

38:32.566 --> 38:34.651
Think I went through that whole thing

38:34.651 --> 38:39.740
just to see that kid rot
in a stinky little town here?

38:39.823 --> 38:42.367
That boy has a gift.

38:42.367 --> 38:44.995
A God-given talent, MacGyver.

38:45.078 --> 38:48.165
It could earn him a good living.

38:48.332 --> 38:51.293
And he's throwing it away.

38:51.460 --> 38:54.963
I mean, you're worried about one game.

38:56.173 --> 39:00.427
I'm worried about
the rest of my son's life.

39:05.015 --> 39:07.642
The rest of your son's life

39:07.976 --> 39:10.562
starts with tonight's game.

39:11.563 --> 39:16.776
Yes, Mr Kirby, Derek has talent.
He's got a lot of talent.

39:16.776 --> 39:19.863
But right now, he needs a father.

39:30.790 --> 39:35.045
There always seems to be a way
to fix things.

39:47.473 --> 39:50.101
All right, listen up.

39:54.856 --> 39:56.941
I consider myself lucky

39:56.941 --> 40:00.528
to have worked out with you guys
for these last few weeks.

40:00.528 --> 40:03.990
You've made me feel like
part of the team, I appreciate that.

40:03.990 --> 40:06.617
It's been an honour.

40:06.659 --> 40:09.037
But right now
it's important we remember

40:09.037 --> 40:12.540
who got you here in the first place.

40:12.707 --> 40:15.293
Turk Donner.

40:19.505 --> 40:23.176
When I played for Turk
back in high school,

40:23.176 --> 40:27.471
he used to read this
at the top of every season.

40:27.471 --> 40:30.057
It's the Olympic oath.

40:30.516 --> 40:34.770
I think he'd appreciate it
if I read it now.

40:36.731 --> 40:39.108
"In the name of all competitors,

40:39.108 --> 40:42.486
I promise that we will
take part in these games,

40:42.486 --> 40:45.865
respecting and abiding by
the rules that govern them..."

40:45.865 --> 40:48.993
In the true spirit of sportsmanship,

40:48.993 --> 40:52.163
for the glory of the sport

40:52.329 --> 40:54.915
and the honour of the team.

41:04.175 --> 41:06.760
Let's play some hockey.

41:30.409 --> 41:33.036
Please welcome your Raiders!

41:33.162 --> 41:35.789
MacGyver!

41:36.373 --> 41:38.417
Are they ready or what?

41:38.417 --> 41:41.170
Turk, what are you doing
out of the hospital?

41:41.170 --> 41:44.172
I told them I'd crawl here
on my hands and knees

41:44.172 --> 41:46.925
if they didn't
spring me loose for the game.

41:46.925 --> 41:49.344
- Are you ready for this?
- Don't worry.

41:49.344 --> 41:53.473
Somebody's always got battery cables
in case I need a jump start.

41:53.473 --> 41:57.102
Good news about Henderson.
Doctor says he's out of the coma.

41:57.102 --> 41:59.730
- He's going to be just fine.
- Oh, that's great.

41:59.730 --> 42:02.983
- That's terrific.
- MacGyver, this is Tony Ellis.

42:02.983 --> 42:05.819
Director of player personnel
for Team USA.

42:05.819 --> 42:06.945
MacGyver.

42:06.945 --> 42:09.030
- Coach told me about you.
- Same here.

42:09.030 --> 42:11.450
We've both had moments with Kirby.

42:11.450 --> 42:15.662
I lobbied him a little.
He agreed to give Derek a second look.

42:15.662 --> 42:19.916
If I like what I see,
I'll recommend he gets another shot.

42:19.916 --> 42:26.381
Gentlemen, you care to join me?
We've got a championship game to play.

42:33.805 --> 42:36.683
We're into the final minute
of the third period

42:36.683 --> 42:38.685
here in the third and deciding game

42:38.685 --> 42:42.939
of the championship series
at the Kerrisdale Arena.

42:42.939 --> 42:45.817
And a huge goal by Weasel Wilson
for the Hawks

42:45.817 --> 42:48.486
has given them a 4-3 lead.

42:48.653 --> 42:51.156
Their fans can sense victory,

42:51.156 --> 42:54.784
as Kirby is taken in
along the boards hard.

42:54.784 --> 42:58.246
Kirby has undergone rough treatment
from these Hawk players,

42:58.246 --> 43:00.123
especially in the third period.

43:00.123 --> 43:03.209
They realize his importance
to this Raider team.

43:03.209 --> 43:07.213
The Raiders try to gain control,
less than 20 seconds to play.

43:07.213 --> 43:09.632
This could be the last chance
for the Raiders.

43:09.632 --> 43:12.552
The Hawks appear to have
a lock on this one.

43:12.552 --> 43:16.681
Randar bringing it down the right side.
Randar at the blue line.

43:16.681 --> 43:19.142
And now the Hawks' fans
begin to chant.

43:19.142 --> 43:20.977
Only five seconds to play!

43:20.977 --> 43:25.148
Kirby, moving in,
he passes into the front...

43:28.985 --> 43:32.280
Chester Johnson
has sent this game into overtime!

43:32.280 --> 43:36.284
Raider goal scored by number five,
Chester Johnson.

43:36.284 --> 43:39.745
In the final seconds,
Kirby passing to Chester Johnson,

43:39.745 --> 43:44.250
and Johnson, with deadly accuracy,
picking his spot.

43:44.250 --> 43:46.294
We are going into overtime

43:46.294 --> 43:51.340
for only the third time in the history
of this championship series.

43:51.340 --> 43:53.426
The face-off at centre ice.

43:53.426 --> 43:57.805
The Raiders win the face-off
and move into the Hawks' zone.

43:57.805 --> 44:01.892
Maybe they can end it quickly.
No, the Hawks break it up and come back.

44:01.892 --> 44:04.395
The Hawks moving into
the Raider zone now.

44:04.395 --> 44:07.606
A chance for them
to wrap it up in overtime.

44:07.606 --> 44:09.191
Kirby steals the puck.

44:09.191 --> 44:12.111
He's slammed into the boards
behind the Hawks' net.

44:12.111 --> 44:14.697
Kirby thrown to the ice.

44:17.575 --> 44:20.577
It's tied at four, we're in overtime.

44:20.577 --> 44:24.456
Kirby is back on his skates,
he appears a little shaken on the play.

44:24.456 --> 44:28.836
Kirby taking a pass from Morrison
as he crosses the blue line.

44:28.836 --> 44:33.173
The pass goes to Malachuk.
Malachuk fires it around the boards.

44:33.173 --> 44:37.511
The Raiders have it behind the net,
trying to win this game in overtime.

44:37.511 --> 44:40.973
Kirby calling for it,
Kirby has the puck.

44:40.973 --> 44:43.183
Kirby, back out to the blue line.

44:43.183 --> 44:46.395
The defenseman comes out
to try and block the shot.

44:46.395 --> 44:49.231
Kirby fakes the shot.
The defenseman goes around.

44:49.231 --> 44:52.568
Kirby moving in.
He's holding on with the puck.

44:52.568 --> 44:54.945
Is he holding on too long?

44:54.945 --> 44:59.616
Kirby makes the pass,
Johnson is moving into the slot.

44:59.616 --> 45:02.995
Johnson has the puck...

45:03.161 --> 45:06.665
Johnson with a shot!
He scores!

45:11.253 --> 45:16.258
Raider goal scored by number five,
Chester Johnson!

45:22.389 --> 45:24.891
There you go, coach.

45:24.891 --> 45:31.231
Excuse me, gentlemen. I have an
important call to make to T eam USA.
