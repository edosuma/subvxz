If you're going to throw him away,
don't give birth.

02:34.653 --> 02:36.023
Take care of that girl.

04:05.403 --> 04:06.353
Is there anything?

04:09.873 --> 04:11.103
She must have run away.

04:13.273 --> 04:14.313
I guess she was.

04:15.623 --> 04:16.903
Give me the towel.

04:26.153 --> 04:27.873
Woosung-ah, I'm sorry.

04:28.213 --> 04:29.853
I'll definitely come to pick you up.

04:31.103 --> 04:33.333
Here we go again,
"I'll definitely come to pick you up"

04:33.463 --> 04:34.793
No contact information...

04:37.613 --> 04:39.633
I don't think so.

04:40.683 --> 04:42.843
Hey, delete the video quickly.

04:51.433 --> 04:54.313
Your eyes are so bright, huh?

04:54.723 --> 04:57.523
It's because these eyebrows aren't thick enough.

04:57.533 --> 04:59.523
Even so, you're such a cute kid.

05:00.153 --> 05:03.803
How can you think of
throwing it away? Really, huh?

05:05.513 --> 05:07.113
So you are Woosung.

05:07.883 --> 05:09.323
Yes, Woo Sung-ah.

05:10.163 --> 05:13.663
You want to be happy with us now, huh?

05:14.403 --> 05:15.433
Huh?

07:35.863 --> 07:38.433
<i>Those who use a bus or express bus</i>

07:38.433 --> 07:40.423
<i>Please get off.</i>

07:51.773 --> 07:54.663
<i>If you are going to Busan
West Intercity Bus Terminal,</i>

07:54.663 --> 07:56.483
<i>Take exit 3.</i>

07:57.053 --> 07:58.703
<i>Going to Gimhae International Airport...</i>

08:53.263 --> 08:54.803
- How's your knee?
- Yes?

08:53.263 --> 09:02.563
[Okay Laundry]

08:54.803 --> 08:57.143
- You hurt your knee.
- Yes, it's okay.

08:57.143 --> 08:59.053
- Are you okay?
- Oh, it's gotten a lot better.

08:59.233 --> 09:00.443
Okay.

09:00.473 --> 09:03.233
Come out often. You have to come
and go out like this before you can exercise.

09:03.283 --> 09:05.953
<i>It's been a while and I just
want to rest whenever I come here.</i>

09:06.733 --> 09:08.623
Is the laundry doing well these days?

09:09.683 --> 09:11.683
Well, it's just that, what...

09:27.463 --> 09:30.883
Socrates' brother.

09:59.013 --> 10:00.163
By the way,

10:01.543 --> 10:03.993
I can't believe they're thinking about using baby boxes for human trafficking.

10:04.003 --> 10:05.753
That's really daring.

10:07.813 --> 10:10.623
Because they made a box like
that in the first place

10:11.313 --> 10:13.503
There are irresponsible mothers...

10:14.453 --> 10:17.263
Team Leader, you have a very nice side.

10:18.623 --> 10:19.633
Why?

10:19.773 --> 10:21.053
Oh, that baby.

10:21.053 --> 10:23.943
Would he have died if he
had left him on the floor?

10:26.843 --> 10:28.233
I'm kind.

10:29.013 --> 10:30.153
You didn't you know, right?

10:31.223 --> 10:33.493
Was the kid a boy or a girl?

10:40.583 --> 10:41.883
- Hello.
- How are you?

10:41.973 --> 10:43.123
You worked hard.

10:43.303 --> 10:45.543
Last time it was really delicious, that...

10:46.843 --> 10:49.103
The name is Shu, Shu...

10:49.213 --> 10:51.673
- Schweinshaxe.
- Ah, Schweinshaxe.

10:52.003 --> 10:53.593
The next day, my skin

10:53.593 --> 10:55.633
I was really surprised
because it was so smooth.

10:55.633 --> 10:57.633
What are you saying? It's just <i>jokbal</i>.

10:57.913 --> 11:00.053
And, uh, do you happen to know Choucroute?

11:00.353 --> 11:02.393
That's what I'm
going to try this time.

11:02.393 --> 11:04.473
I think you can come and eat
with me when I do that.

11:04.473 --> 11:06.513
It's just a boiled pork. It's bland.

11:07.053 --> 11:09.353
I left the white one at the dry cleaner'

11:09.353 --> 11:10.693
I brought it in black instead.

11:10.693 --> 11:12.313
- It's thick.
- Oh, thanks.

11:12.313 --> 11:14.403
- Just in case you didn't know...
- Oh, thanks.

11:14.403 --> 11:16.023
- Go, yeah, go
- Yeah.

11:18.063 --> 11:19.743
- Take care.
- Yes, yes.

11:23.943 --> 11:25.273
Really, no matter what

11:25.273 --> 11:27.703
He come down, say
hello and see off...

11:27.703 --> 11:28.953
It's okay.

11:28.953 --> 11:30.733
I'm just staying home all day anyway, so what?

11:30.733 --> 11:32.333
It's good to work out.

11:33.233 --> 11:35.753
He's such a person that is perfect for marriage.

11:35.873 --> 11:36.843
Oh, really?

11:37.403 --> 11:39.313
What about it? Do you want it?

11:39.613 --> 11:41.563
No, because even if you have a baby,

11:41.563 --> 11:43.873
Since you write at home,
you can take care of the kids...

11:46.203 --> 11:47.633
Did the baby's mother come to visit?

11:52.743 --> 11:53.813
What's wrong?

11:54.763 --> 11:55.843
Yes.

11:56.453 --> 11:58.903
She said she left it outside the box.

12:02.973 --> 12:05.243
Are you not mistaken?
Are you out of your mind?

12:10.913 --> 12:14.663
Hey, if you think you're going to
the police, bring them over here, got it?

12:15.593 --> 12:16.713
I will do that.

12:18.643 --> 12:19.463
Got it.

12:26.273 --> 12:28.273
There's nothing
written in the records though...

12:31.303 --> 12:32.603
Call the pastor.

12:32.603 --> 12:35.273
And can I ask you a favor
to take Soo-kyung a bath?

12:35.273 --> 12:36.523
Yes, I understand.

12:41.093 --> 12:42.943
You were on duty yesterday, right?

12:43.963 --> 12:46.203
Yes, I always...

12:46.973 --> 12:50.083
Can you show her some
of the babies you have now?

12:55.593 --> 12:57.333
This is a playroom for big kids.

12:57.763 --> 13:00.093
There are now nineteen
children living there.

13:00.973 --> 13:03.033
They're all dumped in the baby box.

13:09.553 --> 13:11.433
He came in last week and...

13:11.653 --> 13:13.523
Her mom was 15 years old and...

13:15.433 --> 13:17.023
His mom is from Pakistan.

13:18.333 --> 13:20.403
What, are you a babysitter?

13:21.653 --> 13:22.903
That's it?

13:25.503 --> 13:26.703
That's right, for now.

13:29.483 --> 13:32.773
What about letters?
Did you put it in together?

13:35.203 --> 13:36.123
Yes.

13:37.133 --> 13:40.193
What about your name and contact information?
Did you write that too?

13:43.903 --> 13:45.843
So even if you have a baby,

13:46.213 --> 13:48.093
There is no evidence
that you're the mother...

13:49.213 --> 13:50.393
What's going on?

13:51.713 --> 13:54.523
She said she's looking
for a baby, it's Woosung.

13:55.793 --> 13:58.943
I heard you left your baby
outside the baby box yesterday.

14:00.443 --> 14:03.783
If you put it in the box, our
staff will go out immediately.

14:03.783 --> 14:05.513
I would have talked to the baby's mother.

14:05.513 --> 14:06.513
Right.

14:06.843 --> 14:09.113
- That's what I said.
- Peek-a-boo!

14:09.383 --> 14:11.243
Peek-a-boo!

14:50.413 --> 14:51.493
Of course not.

14:53.643 --> 14:54.783
Kidnapping?

14:55.943 --> 14:57.503
I mean, what are you talking about...

14:58.063 --> 14:59.123
Hey, isn't it?

15:00.643 --> 15:02.383
You threw him away.
What are you talking about?

15:02.383 --> 15:04.293
I didn't throw it away, didn't I leave it to you?

15:04.853 --> 15:06.923
Do you think we're like a dog hotel?

15:07.883 --> 15:10.883
I wrote in the letter saying
I'd come to pick him up.

15:16.503 --> 15:18.833
If there's a message that
you're coming to pick him up,

15:18.833 --> 15:21.523
The church takes him off the adoption lists.

15:22.183 --> 15:24.163
He's 100% going to a daycare.

15:24.893 --> 15:26.273
Do you know what that means?

15:27.083 --> 15:30.033
Well, I guess you
did it out of love though

15:30.103 --> 15:33.813
That's what narrows down
this child's future possibilities.

15:34.903 --> 15:36.123
We are...

15:36.733 --> 15:37.833
Yes, Woosung...

15:38.373 --> 15:42.793
I want to save Woosung
from such a dark future.

15:44.083 --> 15:46.603
Rather than growing up as an
orphan in a daycare facility

15:46.683 --> 15:49.303
I prefer to grow him up
in a warm home...

15:50.993 --> 15:52.303
It's much better.

15:55.703 --> 15:56.643
Adoption.

15:57.813 --> 15:59.433
We're looking for parents to raise them.

16:00.183 --> 16:02.443
You don't have
the right to do that.

16:02.443 --> 16:04.693
You don't have either,
because you threw him away.

16:04.693 --> 16:06.863
- You stole them.
- For protection.

16:06.863 --> 16:10.233
Eh, of course we don't
have that right, we don't.

16:10.243 --> 16:12.953
In a nutshell...

16:13.003 --> 16:15.673
Should I say it's a good will? Yeah.

16:17.073 --> 16:18.423
Good will...

16:19.333 --> 16:21.973
It's been a while since I heard that word.

16:22.043 --> 16:24.753
Even if they want to have children,
they can't have them

16:24.753 --> 16:26.293
And in the arms of those parents

16:26.293 --> 16:28.953
who can't wait for the adoption screening period,

16:29.293 --> 16:33.933
The person who had to separate
him for this unspeakable circumstance...

16:34.723 --> 16:36.453
Your name is...

16:37.943 --> 16:40.183
It's Seon-ah, Moon Seon-ah.

16:40.373 --> 16:41.603
Ms. Seon-ah.

16:41.603 --> 16:45.113
It's a Cupid holding
Seon-ah's precious baby.

16:45.113 --> 16:46.653
You can think of it that way.

16:47.343 --> 16:51.193
Yes, I promise to find the best
adoptive parents for Woosung.

16:53.313 --> 16:55.003
Cupid my ass...

16:55.553 --> 16:57.873
Yeah, well,
It's a bit weird to call him...

16:58.193 --> 16:59.503
What's good...

16:59.543 --> 17:02.753
Should I call him the uncle of Samshin*?
Since it's two of you, the three Gods?

16:59.563 --> 17:02.743
*T/N The three Gods who occupy the infant and take care of the mother and child

17:03.653 --> 17:05.123
Oh, there...

17:05.123 --> 17:09.253
It's a case by case,
but there's a small kickback.

17:10.473 --> 17:11.853
Reward?

17:12.843 --> 17:14.223
How much was it?

17:14.983 --> 17:18.263
In the case of a boy,
it's about 10 million won.

17:18.793 --> 17:20.013
To whom?

17:20.413 --> 17:24.933
Of course, with Seon-ah
and us who are mediators...

17:30.083 --> 17:31.943
You like good will.

17:32.893 --> 17:35.073
But you're just a broker.

17:37.873 --> 17:40.223
To put it simply, yes.

17:47.213 --> 17:49.213
When is the departure?

17:55.153 --> 17:57.343
- Have a rest.
- Yes, take care.

17:57.343 --> 17:58.593
I will.

18:03.603 --> 18:06.103
She's the mother of that baby, right?

18:07.693 --> 18:09.273
Who knows.

18:11.863 --> 18:14.043
It doesn't look like that...

18:25.253 --> 18:26.523
Oh, Taeho.

18:26.943 --> 18:28.493
What are you doing h...

18:29.903 --> 18:31.453
Oh, hello.

18:32.343 --> 18:34.423
We're closed temporarily today though...

18:34.743 --> 18:37.973
I don't know if this will go away...

18:39.333 --> 18:42.013
This, this...

18:43.223 --> 18:44.183
This is...

18:44.183 --> 18:46.223
Hey, you can clearly see it's a blood.

18:48.123 --> 18:49.523
Well, I'll try then...

18:50.033 --> 18:51.523
And, the...

18:51.973 --> 18:53.933
The money that is due next week...

18:53.943 --> 18:56.323
We're going to open a
chicken restaurant here.

18:59.613 --> 19:01.493
Well, if you really can't
Well, go to the casino...

19:01.493 --> 19:03.823
No. I'm not going back.

19:04.853 --> 19:06.833
I guess there's another way.

19:07.553 --> 19:09.463
Then 5,000 won until next week.
(about $4)

19:09.463 --> 19:11.423
And please take
care of that shirt.

19:11.423 --> 19:12.713
Yes.

19:14.903 --> 19:16.053
Goodbye.

19:18.033 --> 19:19.423
Hey, Taeho.

19:20.513 --> 19:23.473
Since when did you hang
out with thugs like that?

19:24.073 --> 19:25.553
What are you nagging about?

19:25.903 --> 19:28.893
Mister, mind your own business.

19:29.383 --> 19:32.773
You and your mom were doing well.

19:33.723 --> 19:36.233
I feel like throwing up
whenever I see wheat noodles.

19:56.163 --> 19:57.633
What's up with them?

19:58.243 --> 20:01.303
It's nothing.
They came to complain.

20:02.913 --> 20:04.683
Also fix this, please.

20:05.043 --> 20:09.063
This is how you do it.
Press it to the left.

20:20.723 --> 20:22.283
Do I have to take her?

20:23.153 --> 20:26.493
Well, it's good to get less suspicious
when the kid's mom is by his side.

20:28.023 --> 20:30.243
Ms. Seon-ah, let's go, let's go.

20:30.633 --> 20:32.693
She's not crazy about money.

20:33.843 --> 20:36.223
- Five to five?
- Of course.

20:36.263 --> 20:38.253
At least cut it into three pieces...

20:40.703 --> 20:44.203
Two and a half hours by
Gyeongbu Expressway to Yeongdeok.

20:44.223 --> 20:48.163
I took a break at the rest stop
in Gyeongju around lunch time...

21:17.523 --> 21:22.223
With that kind of car,
You won't go too far, will you?

21:23.023 --> 21:26.243
Maybe to Ulsan or Pohang?

21:31.573 --> 21:34.853
I really want to hurry up and
wash up and change clothes.

21:36.883 --> 21:38.063
You know that, right?

21:38.483 --> 21:42.693
I'm gonna make sure
he's caught red-handed.

21:51.163 --> 21:55.163
Ms. Seon-ah, where is your hometown?

21:59.293 --> 22:00.673
I'm from Busan.

22:02.153 --> 22:06.553
He self-proclaimed he's from Seoul.

22:06.553 --> 22:07.703
Self-proclaimed?

22:10.073 --> 22:11.403
Where are you from though?

22:12.083 --> 22:13.313
Yeosu.

22:13.523 --> 22:15.313
Ah...Yeosu?

22:16.233 --> 22:18.543
There's nothing but a gondola, isn't it?

22:18.793 --> 22:20.233
Cable car.

22:20.463 --> 22:22.153
The <i>seodaehoe</i> there is delicious.

22:22.553 --> 22:24.403
Fresh kimchi is also delicious...
Oh, what's that?

22:35.493 --> 22:37.843
Back then, you know when
we went to sell the kid?

22:39.113 --> 22:41.203
Why did we used to pretend a male couple?

22:41.673 --> 22:43.593
Oh yeah, right, right, right.

22:43.593 --> 22:46.963
That was in Yeosu.
Oh, yeah, yeah.

22:47.373 --> 22:50.723
How am I going to live? I must be an
elementary school student already.

22:50.993 --> 22:54.563
The Yeosu night sea ♪

22:58.983 --> 23:02.313
Don't talk nonsense,
leave the negotiation to us

23:02.313 --> 23:06.653
Right, the customer comes first.

23:07.303 --> 23:09.613
- So think of them as people who buy...
- Hyung, hyung

23:09.613 --> 23:10.493
- What?
- He's coming.

23:12.063 --> 23:14.703
Uh, Mr. Lim Chang-ho?

23:15.593 --> 23:17.083
Yes, yes, I'm from Busan...

23:17.083 --> 23:18.913
- Yes, show me the baby.
- Yes, yes.

23:18.923 --> 23:20.653
He slept and just woke up...

23:22.443 --> 23:23.733
He's pretty, right?

23:26.973 --> 23:29.973
Hey, did you do photoshop?

23:30.133 --> 23:32.263
This one is a little
less cute than the picture...

23:32.263 --> 23:33.933
Yes, it's because he slept
and just woke up, that's why.

23:34.153 --> 23:36.473
No, but you can see
the eyebrows here.

23:36.473 --> 23:37.933
It's too thin...

23:37.933 --> 23:41.193
Because it's a baby, I mean, he
usually looks like this, like this.

23:41.193 --> 23:43.353
He's so pretty. Hey,Woosung-ah,
open your eyes.

23:43.363 --> 23:44.473
Open your eyes, huh?

23:44.473 --> 23:45.613
Let's do 400.

23:46.193 --> 23:49.003
No, didn't you say
thousand yesterday?

23:49.003 --> 23:50.953
No, four hundred is a lot for this.

23:50.953 --> 23:52.153
Isn't it?

23:52.543 --> 23:54.413
Or, I'll do it in installments.
Can I pay in installments, right?

23:54.633 --> 23:56.373
- In 12 months.
- Yes.

23:57.183 --> 23:58.703
No, I've never done this before.

23:58.703 --> 24:01.583
No, it would be difficult if you
suddenly put up such a condition.

24:01.583 --> 24:03.793
What kind of person is his father?

24:05.263 --> 24:06.153
His father?

24:07.183 --> 24:08.323
His father, well...

24:08.443 --> 24:09.803
Ah, don't tell me...

24:10.163 --> 24:12.133
I-It's not like rape, is it?

24:12.133 --> 24:13.833
- So it's probably that way.
- What are you talking about?

24:13.833 --> 24:14.983
- If you get involved...
- No.

24:14.993 --> 24:18.063
No, the baby's mother is here,
but she's such a faithful person.

24:18.063 --> 24:21.353
Right now, I'm on my own,
taking care of my ill parents...

24:21.353 --> 24:23.143
Hey, you crazy bastard.

24:24.333 --> 24:25.863
What, what, crazy bastard?

24:26.573 --> 24:30.283
I don't even think about his face,
like no eyebrows or small eyes

24:30.283 --> 24:32.403
What are you saying now? Crazy bitch.

24:32.403 --> 24:35.103
- This woman is crazy, really....
- What, you bastard!

24:35.103 --> 24:37.033
Ms. Seon-ah, Ms. Seon-ah, yes

24:38.483 --> 24:41.833
No, hey, what is this
person doing? Rudely...

24:42.113 --> 24:43.293
Rude?

24:43.483 --> 24:47.923
Yeah, I'm fucking rude.
Are you polite? Huh?

24:47.923 --> 24:51.713
You look at other people's faces and
talk nonsense. Are you being so polite?

24:52.513 --> 24:56.023
Oh, I came all the way to this crappy
village on purpose. What, 400?

24:56.293 --> 24:59.043
I'm not playing around,
this is fuckin' real.

24:59.823 --> 25:02.553
I can never give it to people like you.

25:02.943 --> 25:05.693
Get off before I do
anything worse, you beggar bastard.

25:05.963 --> 25:08.693
What, what a beggar, really...

25:09.853 --> 25:11.213
No...

25:18.893 --> 25:22.173
No, what a beggar...

25:22.223 --> 25:23.083
Really...

25:41.863 --> 25:45.013
would you like to eat crab?
Everything is steamed in the store.

25:48.603 --> 25:49.823
That was too much.

25:50.613 --> 25:52.403
Yeah, yeah, it was too much.

25:52.483 --> 25:54.063
That's what I mean.

25:55.553 --> 25:57.453
The other party is the customer.

25:57.863 --> 25:59.323
We're haggling, each other...

25:59.323 --> 26:01.413
Then you are a customer.

26:01.413 --> 26:03.993
If it wasn't for the customer, I'd be terrified.

26:06.443 --> 26:09.383
And then we find a point of agreement.

26:10.683 --> 26:14.173
So, with that attitude...
No matter what...

26:14.173 --> 26:17.343
Bring a better buyer if
you wanna make it work!

26:19.803 --> 26:21.163
That makes sense.

26:21.163 --> 26:24.453
What is 4 million won in 12 months
installments? Are you kidding me, really?

26:28.733 --> 26:29.913
What should we do?

26:31.373 --> 26:33.073
Are you going back to Busan?

26:34.433 --> 26:37.363
Yeah, what's the point?

26:39.583 --> 26:41.193
Are there any other candidates?

26:45.693 --> 26:47.333
- You're here?
- Yes

26:47.983 --> 26:49.873
Is there blood?

26:50.073 --> 26:51.893
- A little.
- Want some candy?

26:51.903 --> 26:52.963
Oh my, thank you.

26:52.963 --> 26:54.383
Tomorrow is children's day.

26:54.613 --> 26:57.013
Yes, my grandmother gave me
allowance when I came out.

26:57.963 --> 26:58.963
Goodness.

27:02.403 --> 27:03.683
What about identification?

27:06.503 --> 27:08.603
I'm contacting his family right now.

27:09.023 --> 27:10.273
What's the cause of death?

27:10.733 --> 27:12.523
I think he broke his neck because he got beaten.

27:14.553 --> 27:16.133
He's still young though.

27:19.953 --> 27:21.993
I really hate blood.

27:24.893 --> 27:26.413
It's really amazing here.

27:30.513 --> 27:31.833
Huh?

27:32.863 --> 27:34.313
It's a woman.

27:54.593 --> 27:55.853
There will be more, right?

27:59.293 --> 28:01.563
I can't just go back to Busan...

28:02.823 --> 28:03.853
You can't do that.

28:11.373 --> 28:12.623
Hi!

28:14.643 --> 28:17.463
He's been the director for three generations.

28:18.073 --> 28:20.093
It feels like the third generation, right?

28:20.483 --> 28:22.673
- Dongsu-hyung!
- Dongsu-hyung!

28:22.913 --> 28:24.093
- How are you?  - Dongsu-hyung!

28:24.093 --> 28:25.513
- Hi, how are you?
- Hello.

28:25.513 --> 28:27.433
- Brother, I'll show you this!
- It's Dongsu-hyung.

28:27.723 --> 28:29.353
- Hey, it's Dongsu-hyung.
- Dongsu-hyung? Dongsu- hyung?

28:29.853 --> 28:32.143
- Wow, it's Dongsu-hyung!
- Dongsu-hyung.

28:32.313 --> 28:33.933
Dongsu-hyung!

28:34.243 --> 28:35.813
Wow, it's Dongsu-hyung!

28:36.803 --> 28:38.733
Really? Is it true?

28:45.323 --> 28:47.203
That's why you wanted to come here.

28:47.203 --> 28:49.033
Hey, didn't you just call and come?

28:49.903 --> 28:52.813
But has it been down a bit?

28:53.713 --> 28:56.643
3 people in a year and a half.

28:57.303 --> 29:00.133
Man, I lose 450 a month.

29:00.133 --> 29:02.133
With a subsidy.
You kids now go and play.

29:02.243 --> 29:03.673
- Let's go play.
- Let's go.

29:03.713 --> 29:06.133
Hey, the losing team gets a finger flick, okay?

29:06.773 --> 29:08.013
Hurry up!

29:09.833 --> 29:10.933
What?

29:14.933 --> 29:16.603
He got a new wife.

29:17.473 --> 29:20.153
Hey, aren't she too young?

29:20.373 --> 29:21.733
Huh? How did they meet?

29:22.113 --> 29:24.803
Well, a meeting application or
something like that?

29:24.803 --> 29:27.393
Hey, you! Gosh, hey!

29:28.283 --> 29:30.993
Hey, you idiot, I told
you not to go in there, hey!

29:31.123 --> 29:32.463
Can't you see that flower?

29:32.463 --> 29:34.543
- How many times will I tell you! Kiddo.
- Dongsu-hyung! Let's play basketball together.

29:34.713 --> 29:35.963
- Yeah.
- Come quickly.

29:35.963 --> 29:37.583
Nice, nice.

29:40.683 --> 29:43.893
Team leader, last time, to the section chief,

29:44.093 --> 29:48.613
You said that this is the infant sale
that the church is doing as a community...

29:48.613 --> 29:50.103
We're on the same church.

29:50.723 --> 29:52.853
That young man is
also a church employee.

29:52.853 --> 29:53.973
But it's a part-time job.

29:55.193 --> 29:57.953
He's an employee, but I'm a non-regular worker.

29:59.833 --> 30:02.553
It's a bit too much for
a professional broker.

30:02.933 --> 30:04.783
Some things are difficult to do...

30:08.433 --> 30:11.203
You put lukewarm water
in this, don't you? Am I right?

30:14.103 --> 30:16.043
It's because you didn't wait for 3 minutes.

30:17.833 --> 30:21.543
If you sell and get paid, you're a
professional broker, aren't you?

30:23.493 --> 30:25.343
That's right though...

30:27.493 --> 30:31.213
I think that the organization behind
the scenes is a bit too far-fetched.

30:32.433 --> 30:36.663
You don't want to hear the detective
department being sarcastic to us, do you?

30:38.753 --> 30:39.843
Give it to me!

30:40.913 --> 30:41.983
Give me the ball.

30:43.913 --> 30:45.483
No no!

30:45.483 --> 30:47.323
- That's not the goal! that's not goal!
- Yoon Woo-ya

30:47.453 --> 30:48.403
Yes?

30:48.473 --> 30:50.933
You, please lend that to Hajun.

30:51.763 --> 30:53.653
Haejin, stop playing soccer.

30:53.653 --> 30:55.043
Five minutes more!

30:56.823 --> 30:58.843
He's not very good at it, that kid.

31:04.833 --> 31:07.053
That wound of yours won't go away.

31:10.453 --> 31:12.803
You bled so much back then, and you

31:13.283 --> 31:15.473
I called an ambulance and
it wasn't even a fuss, man.

31:16.733 --> 31:18.733
There was a kite on the branch

31:18.813 --> 31:21.093
I was going to grab it,
but it broke so fast...

31:23.553 --> 31:26.023
Youngmin is the only
troublemaker like that.

31:27.413 --> 31:28.443
Youngmin?

31:29.773 --> 31:31.243
Oh, Youngmin?

31:31.993 --> 31:33.493
He's escaping now.

31:33.933 --> 31:34.953
Again?

31:37.593 --> 31:39.543
It's just like the old days.

31:52.873 --> 31:54.223
I didn't hear from you.

31:55.043 --> 31:56.303
I'm sorry.

31:58.623 --> 32:01.893
Now I'm not here for
anything in particular.

32:09.673 --> 32:13.823
Yes, well, at first, it felt
like seeing the line once.

32:14.293 --> 32:15.393
Tow.

32:15.643 --> 32:17.743
Yeah, then I'll take a picture
and send it to you, yeah.

32:21.063 --> 32:24.623
Your eyebrows are a bit thin, huh?

32:28.443 --> 32:30.803
Excuse me for a second.

32:35.153 --> 32:37.133
- That's wierd.
- Huh?

32:38.393 --> 32:41.753
Why? If you do it like this,
he looks so manly.

32:42.543 --> 32:44.313
But why am I your wife?

32:47.943 --> 32:50.153
- Dongsu knows everyone here.
- Oh, it's a baby.

32:50.163 --> 32:51.643
Then you can call me your daughter.

32:51.663 --> 32:53.333
<i>So cute.</i>

32:55.263 --> 32:57.123
We don't look alike at all.

32:57.633 --> 32:59.533
Hey, kid, don't touch him.

32:59.543 --> 33:00.993
With your hands touching the ball.

33:01.453 --> 33:03.123
I said don't touch him.

33:03.143 --> 33:05.423
And I'm doing this until
someone comes to buy him.

33:05.423 --> 33:08.653
No matter what I told you,
don't touch him like that!

33:09.653 --> 33:10.923
With your hands touching the ball.

33:11.293 --> 33:12.883
He has a weird eyebrows.

33:20.793 --> 33:22.523
Can't I be your son?

33:23.003 --> 33:23.983
Why?

33:25.193 --> 33:26.523
I want to play soccer.

33:26.803 --> 33:27.813
Soccer?

33:28.013 --> 33:31.193
I want to make a lot of
money like Son Heung-min.

33:31.623 --> 33:34.653
Uncle Woosung was
born not long ago...

33:35.363 --> 33:38.453
Well, a second one is still a bit, isn't it?

33:38.813 --> 33:41.203
Yeah, one is enough.

33:42.293 --> 33:44.533
That would be a good suggestion.

33:47.983 --> 33:51.503
The kid who grew up here once
became a professional soccer player.

33:51.603 --> 33:53.593
He, what did he say...

33:53.613 --> 33:55.823
The one who has the striped uniform.

33:56.123 --> 33:57.223
I don't know.

33:58.233 --> 34:01.173
Well, at a nursery school, even
people from here can succeed.

34:01.173 --> 34:02.333
I'm just promoting it but

34:03.333 --> 34:06.063
- 97%
- He's pretending to know again.

34:07.513 --> 34:09.693
- 3% would be great.
- What a kid.

34:10.153 --> 34:12.403
Look at how you get angry again
for talking about the nursery school.

34:12.693 --> 34:15.033
What percentage of
people usually succeed...

34:18.053 --> 34:19.243
Who are you?

34:20.543 --> 34:23.793
One escaped.
He must have been caught and dragged.

34:25.163 --> 34:27.373
I broke Dongsu-hyung's record!

34:29.423 --> 34:31.603
It took me three days to get caught!

34:32.573 --> 34:33.803
I'm proud of you.

34:34.203 --> 34:37.263
No, in terms of time and
distance, I'm farther away...

34:39.233 --> 34:41.393
You're really good for you.

34:41.393 --> 34:42.923
Yes, hello?

34:43.973 --> 34:48.063
<i>Okay, I got it
You're talking about Uljin, right?</i>

34:48.403 --> 34:50.103
<i>- No, no, that's fine.</i>
- What?

34:50.773 --> 34:52.443
<i>- See you tomorrow.</i>
- What's with your eyebrows?

34:54.613 --> 34:57.333
Seafood doenjang is here.

35:02.773 --> 35:05.703
- Hey, the coin laundry...
- Oh, hyung, and

35:05.893 --> 35:07.163
This is my junior Siwoo.

35:07.163 --> 35:08.363
- I was the forward.
- Siwoo.

35:08.363 --> 35:11.033
- He was a midfielder.
- Can you put him back?

35:11.303 --> 35:14.743
Back then, man, I would
have made two soccer teams

35:14.743 --> 35:16.423
- Isn't it?
- Right now...

35:16.433 --> 35:18.093
- If I'm going to coach you,
- The pants are shortened

35:18.093 --> 35:19.173
Put it down again.

35:19.183 --> 35:20.293
Two or three nurseries should be combined

35:20.293 --> 35:20.923
- 11 people...
- My knees are tired.

35:20.923 --> 35:22.923
- You don't sew the lining, huh?
- No, no one.

35:24.623 --> 35:27.183
You know the law, adoption...

35:27.183 --> 35:29.683
Yes, the adoption law.

35:30.363 --> 35:33.593
Thanks to you, the conditions for overseas adoption
have become stricter, so I thought it would be fine.

35:33.733 --> 35:36.193
But don't all the kids
want to be adopted?

35:37.413 --> 35:38.863
Well, who knows...

35:39.173 --> 35:42.203
That kid who likes
soccer, he was very active.

35:42.203 --> 35:44.063
Yes, Haejin.

35:45.433 --> 35:47.413
He's already late.

35:48.013 --> 35:49.253
He's 7 years old.

35:49.703 --> 35:50.713
He's 8 years old.

35:50.713 --> 35:52.833
Oh, it's late, he's late.

35:53.433 --> 35:54.333
He's late.

35:54.333 --> 35:57.503
That, adoption, well, that one...

35:57.513 --> 36:00.513
I guess it's until he's 6 years old.

36:00.563 --> 36:03.683
Well, he himself knows well...

36:06.253 --> 36:09.473
Gosh, there are kids who
come because they don't like it.

36:09.703 --> 36:13.273
You know, it happened a few days ago, that's why

36:13.493 --> 36:15.553
The adopted child was abused.

36:17.583 --> 36:19.573
Because blood is thicker than water.

36:20.093 --> 36:21.993
After being adopted

36:21.993 --> 36:24.433
How about having a
child born in that house?

36:25.453 --> 36:29.543
Yeah, most of the kids
here at least once, huh?

36:30.263 --> 36:34.123
You've been denied your existence
when you've been abandoned, right?

36:34.163 --> 36:36.123
But there again...

36:37.043 --> 36:40.213
Then I will continue
to live a life of denial.

36:40.463 --> 36:41.303
What?

36:41.463 --> 36:43.593
Then do something about the whistle.

36:43.593 --> 36:44.973
It's not like the military.

36:45.803 --> 36:46.803
- Hey.
- Whistle.

36:47.373 --> 36:49.813
I'm like, huh?

36:50.683 --> 36:54.063
I want to be something
like a father to them.

36:54.173 --> 36:55.273
Got it?

36:55.493 --> 36:59.773
So this whistle, huh?
I'm doing this, huh?

37:07.123 --> 37:08.533
Hey, hide quickly!

37:21.983 --> 37:27.093
Sleep well, my baby

37:29.083 --> 37:34.873
In the front yard and back garden

37:36.083 --> 37:41.423
Birds and baby sheep

37:43.063 --> 37:48.013
Everyone is sleeping

38:09.083 --> 38:10.353
I sang.

38:11.123 --> 38:12.223
What song?

38:13.553 --> 38:14.773
A lullaby.

38:15.743 --> 38:17.193
Lullaby?

38:22.753 --> 38:25.653
It's so good that there's nothing here.

38:26.533 --> 38:28.283
Let's take all of them.

38:29.893 --> 38:31.283
Rub his earlobe like this.

38:31.983 --> 38:33.743
That's a lot of talk...

38:35.663 --> 38:36.663
Well, if you look for more

38:36.663 --> 38:38.963
There must be a better match...

38:39.213 --> 38:41.083
Let's just go with people who cried easily.

38:41.573 --> 38:44.133
Goodnes, well done.

38:44.653 --> 38:47.263
Oh my, you had a good bath.

38:47.723 --> 38:50.713
Your mom wants to say bye to you soon.

38:52.203 --> 38:53.613
We work so hard...

38:53.613 --> 38:55.533
Do you know how difficult it
is to raise a child by yourself?

38:57.013 --> 38:58.963
But throwing away one's
own children like that

38:58.963 --> 39:00.273
You can't justify it.

39:00.273 --> 39:01.943
How would you justify selling kids?

39:02.093 --> 39:04.753
There are people who throw them
away, so there are people who sell them.

39:04.753 --> 39:06.363
The order has to be right.

39:06.693 --> 39:10.283
Then you shouldn't
have made a box like that.

39:10.283 --> 39:12.233
That's what I mean, huh?

39:12.233 --> 39:14.493
Thinking about saving the baby. What do you know?

39:14.493 --> 39:16.753
In the end, all I have to do is
make them feel comfortable.

39:16.753 --> 39:19.213
It's not like that,
thanks to that box

39:19.213 --> 39:21.413
Woosung is alive like this.

39:21.733 --> 39:24.453
It has alcohol in it,
you can't wipe his face with that.

39:24.453 --> 39:25.833
He's crying.

39:27.633 --> 39:28.883
Sorry, sorry.

39:28.883 --> 39:30.933
Then I'll leave a letter.

39:31.303 --> 39:33.333
How many moms do you
think will come to pick me up?

39:33.343 --> 39:34.723
How do I know?

39:35.613 --> 39:37.523
It's one out of forty.

39:37.823 --> 39:40.143
The other 39 people
never contacted me again.

39:40.673 --> 39:44.273
Why do you only say something to your mom?
Tell the fathers the same thing.

39:44.273 --> 39:46.903
Then, at least leave your
contact information in the letter.

39:47.303 --> 39:49.223
I'm already hearing that for the second time.

39:49.513 --> 39:51.493
Why? Should I tell you again?

39:51.993 --> 39:53.413
I can tell you as many times as I want.

39:53.413 --> 39:55.163
Who are you to be so bossy?

39:55.303 --> 39:57.373
Since the kids are calling you hyung
at this pathetic nursery school,

39:57.373 --> 39:58.333
Do you think you can do anything?

39:58.333 --> 40:00.963
Are you proud?
Just live here, then.

40:10.883 --> 40:13.133
Oh my, it's cold.

40:13.313 --> 40:14.663
Woosung...

40:14.663 --> 40:18.143
I thought her mother would be one in forty

40:18.463 --> 40:20.463
If you look at the playground,

40:21.173 --> 40:23.273
There's an old door, right? Over there.

40:23.273 --> 40:25.653
I guess he was left there.

40:25.863 --> 40:28.613
With a letter saying,
"I'll come back to pick you up."

40:28.833 --> 40:31.823
Don't be so abrupt,
so please cut me some slack.

40:42.373 --> 40:44.223
Jiyoung was working.

40:45.253 --> 40:46.583
He's back.

40:47.863 --> 40:49.413
It's easy to say, what a singer...

40:52.533 --> 40:55.013
I liked his voice though.

40:56.733 --> 40:57.883
3 to 1.

41:05.583 --> 41:06.733
But what...

41:07.413 --> 41:09.363
We'll all settle down here.

41:13.443 --> 41:15.113
But it's going to be fun.

41:15.773 --> 41:17.963
- Yes!
- 4 to 1.

41:20.893 --> 41:22.163
Fun?

41:26.733 --> 41:29.633
It's more fun than being alone.

41:33.453 --> 41:34.723
But still

41:36.123 --> 41:40.263
Go away bro, over there!

41:44.023 --> 41:45.443
Far away, where?

41:45.673 --> 41:46.663
Far.

41:48.193 --> 41:52.733
You are our children's hope
and our children are the stars.

41:55.133 --> 41:56.913
Where are you going...

41:57.803 --> 41:59.343
Anywhere.

42:00.983 --> 42:05.203
I think it'll be sad if you come back, really.

43:22.353 --> 43:23.873
Good morning.

43:35.523 --> 43:38.093
Woo Sung-ah, it's raining.

43:39.083 --> 43:40.093
It's a rain.

43:40.973 --> 43:42.843
It's a raindrops.

43:44.543 --> 43:45.893
It's just the same.

43:58.943 --> 44:00.533
I'm sorry about yesterday.

44:02.513 --> 44:04.103
I was too harsh.

44:06.283 --> 44:07.913
What did you say?

44:14.083 --> 44:16.003
I dream sometimes.

44:19.043 --> 44:20.723
It's raining...

44:23.093 --> 44:26.593
The rain washed
me clean until yesterday.

44:31.963 --> 44:34.023
But when I open my eyes

44:35.413 --> 44:38.983
It's still raining like a downpour.

44:42.943 --> 44:44.783
Nothing has changed for me.

44:47.133 --> 44:48.993
Wouldn't it be okay if you had an umbrella?

44:50.953 --> 44:52.123
Umbrella?

44:54.843 --> 44:57.383
Yes, a big umbrella.

44:59.693 --> 45:01.453
Something that two people can use...

45:11.123 --> 45:13.233
Don't do it!

45:13.923 --> 45:18.153
I hope it's color red.
The one with strawberries drawing on it.

45:20.303 --> 45:22.993
When I was young,
my friend had something like that.

45:23.903 --> 45:25.823
I was so jealous of that.

45:28.453 --> 45:29.583
Did you steal it?

45:30.303 --> 45:33.193
Yes, I took it and threw away.

46:14.643 --> 46:16.663
But they're not related by blood, are they?

46:16.863 --> 46:19.293
Yes, everyone
calls her Mom, but...

46:19.403 --> 46:20.483
Everyone?

46:21.623 --> 46:23.723
I wake up and it's
my grandpa's house.

46:23.723 --> 46:25.803
I was surprised
and couldn't sleep.

46:25.843 --> 46:27.153
What is this?

46:27.153 --> 46:28.723
No, I saw a police car
coming to them like this.

46:28.723 --> 46:31.013
- What happened? Yes?
- Quiet, please quiet.

46:32.243 --> 46:34.723
- Hey, come here!
- Hold on a second.

46:37.063 --> 46:38.853
No, that...

46:39.483 --> 46:43.403
I've never seen him.
What's going on?

46:44.303 --> 46:47.533
He was killed at the hotel, then...

46:49.123 --> 46:50.283
Take a good look.

46:51.453 --> 46:55.703
It's a picture taken from the hotel
CCTV, this girl lives here, right?

46:56.903 --> 46:58.003
Yeji.

46:58.783 --> 47:00.463
Get the kids over there.

47:01.133 --> 47:03.043
In front of the kids...

47:05.103 --> 47:06.803
Wait a minute, tall kid.

47:06.953 --> 47:08.553
Tall kid, wait a minute.

47:09.833 --> 47:11.763
Here, a candy.

47:14.893 --> 47:18.103
Can I talk to you comfortably?

47:19.153 --> 47:21.483
Is this the older
sister who lives here?

47:24.293 --> 47:25.733
I don't know.

47:34.013 --> 47:35.453
Excuse, ma'am.

47:35.643 --> 47:39.463
The one here, this kid here is a baby, isn't he?

47:39.733 --> 47:43.983
I told her not to give birth
How can that girl become a mother?

47:44.513 --> 47:46.073
What? What did you say?

47:46.493 --> 47:49.923
Gosh, I said
I told her not to give birth!

47:49.933 --> 47:52.453
How can a girl like that become a mother?

47:55.113 --> 47:56.693
Jeong-suk! Jeong-suk!

47:59.393 --> 48:02.233
This is what you do
with the kids, this is...

48:02.523 --> 48:03.903
Are you like a mother?

48:05.693 --> 48:07.193
I...

48:07.513 --> 48:11.863
I was just taking the kids out of
the way and looking after them.

48:13.533 --> 48:14.753
Murder?

48:18.413 --> 48:20.013
You mean prostitution?

48:24.653 --> 48:26.173
That is to say...

48:26.523 --> 48:29.033
She need to run away, but
the baby got in her way.

48:32.963 --> 48:37.563
Give me three days, I'll make
sure they sell it within that time.

48:50.523 --> 48:52.783
If it's murder, the detective department will move?

48:52.783 --> 48:54.493
They're already moving.

48:56.893 --> 48:58.163
I should set it up.

48:58.933 --> 48:59.993
Setting?

49:01.263 --> 49:02.293
As a buyer.

49:17.813 --> 49:20.393
- Now you're calling...
- Aww, damn...

49:20.453 --> 49:22.583
Se's not picking up, Uljin.

49:22.833 --> 49:26.563
Oh, that's because I sent a
picture with his eyebrows like this.

49:27.723 --> 49:28.903
What do you think of this?

49:29.493 --> 49:30.593
20 million won.

49:31.553 --> 49:33.133
Twice the market price...

49:34.103 --> 49:35.283
Do you want to meet her?

49:35.283 --> 49:36.703
Oh? Who?

49:36.973 --> 49:38.373
I think it's the owner of the building.

49:40.843 --> 49:42.333
How old are is that woman?

49:43.023 --> 49:44.213
36 years old.

49:44.233 --> 49:46.713
- Why?
- You wish she were younger?

49:47.933 --> 49:49.503
No, not like that.

49:52.163 --> 49:54.173
I have a somewhat
ominous feeling though.

49:58.273 --> 50:01.503
But isn't it a bit cheap?

50:03.543 --> 50:04.823
Ten million won?

50:07.033 --> 50:09.423
The market price for a baby.

50:10.833 --> 50:12.983
Even a girl costs 8 million won.

50:12.983 --> 50:14.823
- Team Leader.
- What?

50:15.893 --> 50:17.413
To provoke the crime

50:17.413 --> 50:18.593
- Using the bait...
- 2 million won.

50:18.593 --> 50:20.393
- Isn't that illegal?
- What's the difference?

50:20.393 --> 50:21.733
I'm getting annoyed.

50:24.803 --> 50:26.083
What did you say?

50:26.693 --> 50:30.873
I've learned that it won't even
be taken up as evidence in the trial

50:34.493 --> 50:36.223
The crime was intentional from the beginning.

50:37.063 --> 50:39.143
This is not a crime.

50:41.183 --> 50:42.593
It's an opportunity.

50:43.553 --> 50:44.693
Opportunity...

50:47.103 --> 50:50.003
Ah, Tess-hyung, Sokra...

50:50.053 --> 50:52.983
Hey, when we get
a contract, there...

50:53.133 --> 50:56.573
From Busan over there,
over there, over there?

50:57.403 --> 50:59.283
Shall we go see Jennifer again?

50:59.873 --> 51:00.863
I don't want to, go alone.

51:00.863 --> 51:03.783
- I'm not very interested in those stores.
- Keep it quiet, you bastard...

51:04.323 --> 51:08.123
Even in this kind of situation, you're
good at making useless noises like that.

51:08.493 --> 51:11.293
Well, let's relax the
atmosphere for a moment.

51:11.683 --> 51:14.383
Even in the military,
before soldiers go to training

51:14.383 --> 51:17.173
Hyung, you didn't even go to the
military because you were in a cell.

51:17.173 --> 51:20.223
You haven't been there either.
Those from an orphanage are exempt.

51:20.733 --> 51:23.353
I'm on the same level as the gold medalist.

51:24.423 --> 51:28.363
Why is love like this again?

51:39.763 --> 51:40.913
What's wrong?

51:45.643 --> 51:47.563
Why do you park your car like this?

51:49.643 --> 51:51.183
Oh, I think I'm going to pee.

51:52.383 --> 51:54.023
Oh, I think I'm really going to pee.

51:55.363 --> 51:56.673
That kid...

52:08.123 --> 52:11.603
I told you I had
a ominous feeling.

52:12.733 --> 52:14.233
Is that feeling this feeling?

52:24.463 --> 52:27.793
It was shaking so much that
I almost pee in a little bit.

52:32.753 --> 52:34.043
This car stinks.

52:37.073 --> 52:39.593
You ride as you please
and talk what you want.

52:40.383 --> 52:43.543
Uncle, can't you take me too?

52:43.553 --> 52:46.683
No, everyone will be worried.

52:47.223 --> 52:49.893
I'll give you money, so you
go back on the bus by yourself.

52:50.003 --> 52:51.023
No.

52:55.203 --> 52:57.983
I mean, why are you
interrupting our family trip?

52:58.493 --> 53:00.823
I know everything.
That you're not a family.

53:00.973 --> 53:02.703
You're trying to sell Woosung.

53:04.193 --> 53:06.533
- How far did you hear it?
- Everything.

53:12.443 --> 53:15.443
Please be careful.
I'll put it here.

53:16.553 --> 53:19.483
What is important is that the
baby has thin hair or small eyes.

53:19.483 --> 53:21.673
Please don't say
such negative things.

53:22.173 --> 53:24.973
And please don't even ask the
baby's mother about her father.

53:24.973 --> 53:26.833
- There must be something.
- Yes.

53:27.783 --> 53:30.143
- Have some coffee.
- Yes, thank you, I will drink.

53:30.333 --> 53:31.683
Thank you.

53:33.773 --> 53:36.233
Do I look like the owner of the building?

53:38.093 --> 53:40.023
Aren't you a little young?

53:40.973 --> 53:42.053
I'm sorry.

53:42.863 --> 53:45.073
It's okay, there's no need to apologize.

53:45.073 --> 53:46.113
Ah, yes.

53:46.313 --> 53:49.373
Then since you're actually married,

53:49.723 --> 53:51.353
You are setting without
marriage registration.

53:52.623 --> 53:55.213
- That's why formal adoption is difficult.
- Yes.

53:55.213 --> 53:56.343
Yes.

53:58.363 --> 54:01.113
The sperm count is a bit low.

54:02.463 --> 54:03.613
Me?

54:05.933 --> 54:08.013
"Above all, just give me the
money quickly", be very naturally.

54:08.013 --> 54:10.153
I see, the sperm count
is low and naturally...

54:10.153 --> 54:13.183
There's not enough sperm and the money......

54:13.573 --> 54:17.523
Then, let's do a dialogue here.

54:17.523 --> 54:18.693
Yes, alright.

54:20.283 --> 54:23.153
And here's the money we have prepared.

54:26.643 --> 54:29.243
It's already been 5 years since
I got infertility treatment.

54:29.703 --> 54:32.203
We're both very tired.

54:32.813 --> 54:36.873
Well, Detective, in this part,
Why don't we talk about a real marriage?

54:36.883 --> 54:38.453
Because I didn't get married properly

54:38.453 --> 54:40.213
Official adoption is a little bit
different, something like this...

54:40.213 --> 54:41.593
Okay, let's go with that.

54:42.173 --> 54:43.133
Thank you.

54:45.903 --> 54:49.473
We will cherish him
like our real children.

54:51.973 --> 54:54.813
Shall we remove the "real"
thing from "our real" thing?

54:54.813 --> 54:56.023
Oh, shall we remove the "real" thing?

54:56.403 --> 54:58.123
Oh yeah, except for the "real" thing, yes.

54:58.763 --> 55:00.783
Let's cherish our children
I mean...

55:00.783 --> 55:03.073
We cherish our children...

55:03.843 --> 55:05.053
- What did I say?
- Cherish.

55:05.053 --> 55:05.943
Oh right.

55:06.253 --> 55:08.763
<i>We cherish our children...</i>

55:08.853 --> 55:10.933
Like our children...

55:11.503 --> 55:14.033
We will cherish it.

55:21.953 --> 55:26.903
Let's get serious,
let's go get serious.

55:26.903 --> 55:29.133
Let's get serious.

55:29.443 --> 55:32.013
Oh, but can I call
this car Haejin-ho?

55:32.583 --> 55:34.473
Sure, do what you want.

55:34.473 --> 55:35.643
Yeah!

55:36.123 --> 55:39.643
But Jennifer? Who is Jennifer?

55:40.543 --> 55:42.223
Your Dongsu-hyung's girlfriend.

55:44.833 --> 55:46.903
Hey, but what's written here?

55:46.903 --> 55:47.943
- Oh, this?
- Yes.

55:47.943 --> 55:48.933
Haejin.

55:48.933 --> 55:51.283
It's my name, the
pastor gave it to me.

55:53.083 --> 55:55.993
I think you really
like your name.

55:56.103 --> 55:57.373
No.

55:57.633 --> 56:00.373
That's how you don't disappear from the nursery.

56:00.563 --> 56:04.253
If you're trying to steal something, you'll
steal everything with your name on it.

56:04.253 --> 56:06.503
- <i>9388, stop to the right.</i>
- Right?

56:09.093 --> 56:11.263
<i>9388, turn right.</i>

56:11.263 --> 56:13.973
What? I didn't even speed up.

56:14.243 --> 56:17.413
Damn it, huh?

56:22.903 --> 56:24.353
You're the wife...

56:25.643 --> 56:28.823
So let's assume that the two of
them are a couple in our store.

56:28.823 --> 56:30.823
I hate it, couple my ass.

56:31.043 --> 56:31.923
I hate it too.

56:31.953 --> 56:33.453
Then let's call it a relative. A distant relative

56:33.453 --> 56:34.993
- Understand?
- How much? six cousin? eight cousin?

56:35.323 --> 56:36.283
- That's important...
- Hello.

56:36.283 --> 56:37.283
Good job, yes

56:37.503 --> 56:38.543
Your license, please.

56:38.863 --> 56:40.043
Yes.

56:40.573 --> 56:43.333
I didn't get that much speed...

56:44.323 --> 56:45.713
Mr. Ha Jin-young.

56:46.273 --> 56:47.883
The car door was open in the back.

56:47.883 --> 56:50.913
If the loads inside are spilled, the
car behind will have a serious accident.

56:51.173 --> 56:52.223
I'm sorry.

56:57.843 --> 56:59.433
Are you all going together somewhere?

56:59.713 --> 57:00.603
Yes!

57:00.603 --> 57:02.813
We're going to Lotte World
to ride a ferris wheel.

57:02.813 --> 57:04.523
Hey, you're going far, aren't you?

57:04.523 --> 57:05.853
Yes, I'm going on a family trip.

57:05.853 --> 57:08.073
But there's no ferris wheel there.

57:08.073 --> 57:09.153
Really?

57:10.063 --> 57:11.943
To ride the Ferris wheel

57:12.093 --> 57:13.403
You need to go to Wolmido.

57:13.763 --> 57:15.993
So shall we go to Wolmido?

57:15.993 --> 57:16.953
- When the time comes.
- Yes!

57:16.953 --> 57:19.373
Ask daddy to take you
for a ride on the cruise ship too.

57:19.623 --> 57:22.413
- yes!
- I have a weak stomach.

57:22.563 --> 57:23.833
I get motion sickness...

57:24.693 --> 57:26.463
- Do you do laundry?
- Yes.

57:26.463 --> 57:28.703
No, this is the shirt
I checked out a while ago.

57:28.703 --> 57:30.633
It's all shriveled up
and why is it, this?

57:31.843 --> 57:34.603
You need to dry this
I just turned it around...

57:34.603 --> 57:35.513
Oh yeah?

57:35.513 --> 57:38.143
Gosh, there are too many
amateurs in all laundry these days.

57:38.143 --> 57:39.813
- Boss...
- You should take a look at this.

57:39.813 --> 57:41.103
- Dry this...
- Boss!

57:41.103 --> 57:42.993
- Why?
- I think you should go...

57:43.403 --> 57:44.853
- Yeah, yeah, then...
- The license, yeah.

57:44.853 --> 57:46.023
Yes, thank you.

57:46.213 --> 57:47.903
You must dry it next time.

57:47.903 --> 57:48.773
- Okay.
- Yes.

57:48.773 --> 57:50.023
- Have a good time.
- Yes.

57:52.263 --> 57:54.073
- In Wolmido.
- Yes.

58:06.983 --> 58:08.753
- Hey, hey, hello.
- Oh, yeah

58:08.753 --> 58:10.713
Sorry for being late.
Did you wait long?

58:10.713 --> 58:11.593
- No, no.
- No.

58:11.593 --> 58:12.883
We're just now, yes.

58:12.883 --> 58:13.633
- I see.
- Yes.

58:13.633 --> 58:15.553
This is Ha Sang-hyun.
Are you Song Ji-cheol?

58:15.553 --> 58:16.843
Yes, that's right, I am.

58:16.843 --> 58:18.973
- He, is he Woosung?
- Yes, yes.

58:19.973 --> 58:22.213
- Are you the mother?
- Yes.

58:22.213 --> 58:24.773
Can I hug that baby just once?

58:26.163 --> 58:27.953
Yes, hug him.

58:31.373 --> 58:33.263
I touched it,
I touched it, honey!

58:33.423 --> 58:36.383
His facial features are so clear.

58:36.383 --> 58:37.323
- Can you see it?
- Yes.

58:39.693 --> 58:41.703
Are you really going to raise him properly?

58:42.183 --> 58:45.203
Of course, we will
really cherish him.

58:45.203 --> 58:49.043
Even if your own child is born,
Are you still going to cherish him the same?

58:49.483 --> 58:50.543
Of course.

58:50.913 --> 58:52.083
- Really?
- Let's stop here.

58:52.083 --> 58:54.083
- I have to pay you quickly...
- Uh, it's true.

58:54.423 --> 58:55.313
Give the money, give the money...

58:55.313 --> 58:57.843
- And now the eyebrows...
- Are you going to continue your infertility treatment?

58:59.183 --> 59:02.263
We've already been through 5 years

59:02.263 --> 59:04.223
- We both...
- Both of us, both of us are tired.

59:04.223 --> 59:05.393
- Yes.
- And so, that..

59:05.393 --> 59:07.633
Since we're not
officially married...

59:07.793 --> 59:08.903
Honey...

59:09.243 --> 59:11.013
Have you tested for AMH?

59:12.053 --> 59:14.343
Or maybe HSG?

59:15.593 --> 59:17.653
- Yeah, well that, that one...
- Yeah.

59:18.933 --> 59:20.953
I guess Letrozole didn't work.

59:21.443 --> 59:24.703
Yes, letrozole has more
severe side effects, so I...

59:24.853 --> 59:28.463
It's so hard for me to watch
that, so I'm going to stop now.

59:29.513 --> 59:31.753
Letrozole is an ovulation inducer.

59:33.123 --> 59:35.303
Of course it won't work if you eat it.

59:36.993 --> 59:39.173
So, that sperm...

59:39.693 --> 59:42.183
No, I'm talking about ovulation inducers,
what kind of sperm is coming out?

59:42.183 --> 59:43.553
Come on, take this,
take this, take it.

1:00:00.513 --> 1:00:02.993
That's just for resale, isn't it?

1:00:02.993 --> 1:00:04.373
I recognized it right away.

1:00:04.373 --> 1:00:05.883
Do you know reseller? reseller?

1:00:05.883 --> 1:00:07.463
Uh, Hae-jin, you can't open that window.

1:00:07.463 --> 1:00:08.333
- Who told them?
- Don't touch them.

1:00:08.333 --> 1:00:09.613
I did it for money

1:00:10.143 --> 1:00:12.523
But how do you know so
much about infertility treatment?

1:00:12.533 --> 1:00:14.123
Wow, there's a lot of bubbles.

1:00:14.443 --> 1:00:18.303
No, a similar thing happened last
year too, so hyung was fooled.

1:00:18.333 --> 1:00:20.963
Don't touch it.
It's observation. Ob-observation.

1:00:21.233 --> 1:00:22.463
if you just let it go

1:00:22.463 --> 1:00:24.973
By now, Woosung is probably
going to another country...

1:00:24.973 --> 1:00:25.933
Hey!

1:00:25.933 --> 1:00:27.563
Hey, hey, close it, close it, man!

1:00:34.223 --> 1:00:36.313
Close it, man!
Hey, close it, quick!

1:01:03.263 --> 1:01:04.763
The baby will catch a cold.

1:01:05.013 --> 1:01:06.683
Let's deal with the things
behind us in moderation.

1:01:06.683 --> 1:01:08.063
Don't do it.

1:01:16.513 --> 1:01:18.523
But that license...

1:01:18.523 --> 1:01:19.573
What?

1:01:19.683 --> 1:01:21.153
That, what is Ha Jinyoung?

1:01:22.223 --> 1:01:25.493
The name Sanghyun is my
nickname when I was in the army.

1:01:25.933 --> 1:01:29.303
So hyung, you didn't go
to the military, did you?

1:01:29.683 --> 1:01:31.243
Figure it out, kid.

1:01:31.243 --> 1:01:32.493
Then, what about you?

1:01:32.793 --> 1:01:36.403
"My stomach is a little weak,
so I get motion sickness"?

1:01:36.403 --> 1:01:37.993
Wasn't that so real?

1:01:38.163 --> 1:01:40.953
What do you mean it's real?
It’s completely ridiculous.

1:01:40.953 --> 1:01:42.343
Haejin was better.

1:01:43.063 --> 1:01:44.473
Idiot.

1:01:45.943 --> 1:01:48.033
Actually, my name is Sanghyun...

1:01:48.033 --> 1:01:51.543
Actually I was going to give it to my son
when he was.

1:01:52.273 --> 1:01:53.443
Really?

1:01:54.333 --> 1:01:55.383
Yeah.

1:01:58.443 --> 1:02:00.623
That's not a funny story, huh?

1:02:06.953 --> 1:02:08.253
Soyoung...

1:02:09.243 --> 1:02:10.123
What?

1:02:10.783 --> 1:02:13.543
My real name is Moon So-young.

1:02:13.673 --> 1:02:14.793
Then what about Seon-ah...

1:02:14.793 --> 1:02:18.473
There's a very annoying
lady who lives next door.

1:02:19.943 --> 1:02:22.993
What a bunch of liars, huh?

1:02:56.243 --> 1:02:58.123
No, it just happened...

1:02:59.793 --> 1:03:01.143
Shall we use it?

1:03:02.213 --> 1:03:03.363
Killing a person.

1:03:38.693 --> 1:03:39.923
Hello?

1:03:42.803 --> 1:03:44.003
Who is it?

1:03:46.723 --> 1:03:48.513
Hand over the baby.

1:03:49.693 --> 1:03:53.433
You paid all the money to that mother.

1:03:53.983 --> 1:03:55.223
5 million won.

1:03:57.943 --> 1:04:00.443
You was supposed to erase that
baby on that condition.

1:04:01.443 --> 1:04:03.443
Why did you give birth to a baby?

1:04:16.773 --> 1:04:20.543
Ms. Moon So-young, I'm a police officer.

1:04:20.943 --> 1:04:22.623
Can I talk to you for a minute?

1:05:02.443 --> 1:05:03.543
You're here?

1:05:03.653 --> 1:05:04.753
You're here?

1:05:05.163 --> 1:05:06.473
You took a long time.

1:05:06.493 --> 1:05:08.723
We're making a table for three right now.

1:05:09.283 --> 1:05:10.483
A share table?

1:05:10.533 --> 1:05:12.603
Woosung's share for feeding powdered milk.

1:05:14.153 --> 1:05:15.973
Is something good going on?

1:05:16.173 --> 1:05:17.193
Yeah.

1:05:17.593 --> 1:05:19.433
I have a guest in Seoul.

1:05:20.153 --> 1:05:21.773
They're giving me 30 million won.

1:05:23.803 --> 1:05:26.653
Oh, that's great.

1:05:28.283 --> 1:05:29.773
Are you going to take him a bath now?

1:05:29.783 --> 1:05:31.433
Oh, no.

1:05:32.133 --> 1:05:36.233
He has poop on his butt and that
hyung is really bad at this.

1:05:36.723 --> 1:05:41.043
So, from 6am until 10am.

1:05:41.043 --> 1:05:43.003
TTwo-hour shifts, what do you think?

1:05:44.333 --> 1:05:47.173
Sang, Dong, So, Dong, Sang...

1:05:47.443 --> 1:05:50.673
No, it's a schedule where
you sleep well for 6 hours.

1:05:50.863 --> 1:05:53.843
No, it's not that I sleep well.
Can't I do this?

1:05:54.563 --> 1:05:56.843
- That was a bit harsh.
- Oh, right?

1:05:56.843 --> 1:05:58.353
- I want to do it.
- What?

1:05:58.353 --> 1:05:59.973
- Feeding him milk formula.
- Will you?

1:05:59.973 --> 1:06:02.603
- So, from 4am to 6am?
- Yes.

1:06:03.743 --> 1:06:07.323
Then, from 10 o'clock
until midnight.

1:06:07.373 --> 1:06:09.943
You can't take yours out.

1:06:12.583 --> 1:06:14.493
Doesn't she seems easy to cooperate?

1:06:16.553 --> 1:06:18.033
Right.

1:06:19.683 --> 1:06:22.513
Did the commutation of the
sentence reduction work?

1:06:22.513 --> 1:06:25.293
No, I don't think so.

1:06:25.703 --> 1:06:27.673
<i>- Give it to me.</i>
- Then what is it?

1:06:27.983 --> 1:06:29.433
<i>Hey, then...</i>

1:06:29.733 --> 1:06:31.463
Who knows, well, I...

1:06:32.233 --> 1:06:35.043
I don't know, but...

1:06:35.043 --> 1:06:36.553
<i>You just do everything.</i>

1:06:36.683 --> 1:06:39.013
I don't think it's a commutation.

1:06:39.143 --> 1:06:40.393
<i>I want to take him a bath, too.</i>

1:06:41.283 --> 1:06:43.313
You wash yourself.

1:06:43.313 --> 1:06:44.643
Gosh, I hate it.

1:06:51.433 --> 1:06:53.943
How is it? Did you feed him?

1:06:54.383 --> 1:06:56.323
No, he vomited again.

1:06:59.143 --> 1:07:02.083
Are you sure you cooled it down?
Isn't it because it's too hot?

1:07:04.483 --> 1:07:05.703
It's fine to me.

1:07:06.193 --> 1:07:08.293
Was it because I got wet yesterday?

1:07:09.443 --> 1:07:10.883
I'm sorry, Woo Sung-ah.

1:07:11.193 --> 1:07:13.383
No, it's not because of you.

1:07:13.863 --> 1:07:15.713
No, I don't think it's just a cold...

1:07:17.153 --> 1:07:19.443
Have you ever done this before?

1:07:22.283 --> 1:07:23.923
We have to take him to the hospital, hyung.

1:07:25.863 --> 1:07:29.513
I can't do that.
We might get caught.

1:07:43.393 --> 1:07:47.453
It's not like meningitis, right?

1:07:48.023 --> 1:07:50.333
Since yesterday,
he suddenly have a fever like this...

1:07:52.233 --> 1:07:54.043
Can he get better?

1:07:55.263 --> 1:07:57.093
He's not going die?

1:08:00.283 --> 1:08:01.683
Is this your younger brother?

1:08:04.123 --> 1:08:05.143
Yes.

1:08:05.873 --> 1:08:08.233
He'll be fine, he won't die.

1:08:10.113 --> 1:08:11.973
It does seem like a cold,

1:08:11.973 --> 1:08:15.153
Please take a good look at it
so that it doesn't spread to pneumonia.

1:08:15.373 --> 1:08:18.403
First, I'll prescribe a fever reducer.

1:08:18.413 --> 1:08:21.743
If the fever doesn't go
down, come back tomorrow.

1:08:23.583 --> 1:08:25.873
Woosung-ah, good for you.

1:08:27.943 --> 1:08:32.463
What's sadder than love

1:08:32.463 --> 1:08:35.143
is affection.

1:08:35.323 --> 1:08:37.193
Will the baby be okay?

1:08:39.633 --> 1:08:41.303
Everyone's making a fuss...

1:08:42.163 --> 1:08:44.933
It's just a cold anyway.

1:08:45.013 --> 1:08:47.063
Well, whatever it is, but...

1:08:48.213 --> 1:08:51.303
If he don't get better soon, that's a trouble.

1:08:53.593 --> 1:08:55.193
Are you afraid they won't sell him?

1:09:00.433 --> 1:09:04.323
No, if they can't sell him,
We can't arrest him in the act.

1:09:05.863 --> 1:09:07.953
If you're in the department of
women and adolescents,

1:09:08.273 --> 1:09:12.373
I thought we should cast our nets a little
higher up the river than the detectives.

1:09:14.903 --> 1:09:16.043
At the top of the river?

1:09:17.223 --> 1:09:20.303
Before the baby was abandoned,
Shouldn't you have saved the mother first?

1:09:20.303 --> 1:09:22.943
That's the job of the Department of Health.

1:09:22.943 --> 1:09:26.183
Before she throw him away, the Department of Health.
After she abandoned him, the policeman.

1:09:27.543 --> 1:09:29.353
Gosh, really...

1:09:31.403 --> 1:09:33.983
Chief, why are you being
so cold to that woman?

1:09:40.873 --> 1:09:42.443
Because she's irresponsible.

1:09:44.843 --> 1:09:47.373
Because she give birth to her will
and throw it away as she wanted.

1:09:48.903 --> 1:09:53.123
But she's like that, too.
Being neat...

1:09:55.573 --> 1:09:58.463
Do you understand how a mother feels
about abandoning her child?

1:10:01.733 --> 1:10:03.173
I can't understand it.

1:10:12.433 --> 1:10:15.603
He can't do this.
This isn't a playground.

1:10:15.603 --> 1:10:17.903
Right, yes, this is...

1:10:18.423 --> 1:10:20.653
- Are you his father?
- Oh, yes...

1:10:22.253 --> 1:10:24.033
- Because there are a lot of patients here.
- Yes.

1:10:24.033 --> 1:10:25.503
- Be careful.
- Oh, yes.

1:10:25.513 --> 1:10:26.903
Are you Woosung's father?

1:10:26.903 --> 1:10:27.783
<i>You, really...</i>

1:10:27.783 --> 1:10:29.203
Yeah, oh...

1:10:30.153 --> 1:10:31.163
Yes.

1:10:31.353 --> 1:10:33.083
What is Woosung's resident registration number?

1:10:33.093 --> 1:10:34.123
<i>- Okay.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

1:10:34.123 --> 1:10:36.043
<i>- You can't do that, I'm scolded.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

1:10:36.123 --> 1:10:37.833
Actually, it's only been 1 month...

1:10:37.833 --> 1:10:38.883
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1:10:39.333 --> 1:10:42.143
- One month?
- Everyone was surprised.

1:10:43.533 --> 1:10:45.743
Is it because of that powdered milk?
That...

1:10:46.083 --> 1:10:47.593
That American thing, what was it? That...

1:10:47.593 --> 1:10:48.843
Similac...

1:10:49.793 --> 1:10:51.803
That Similac...

1:10:51.813 --> 1:10:53.813
- His grandmother is in the countryside.
- Yes.

1:10:53.823 --> 1:10:55.983
- I wonder how many she sent me...
- I know.

1:10:56.153 --> 1:10:58.273
She must have been so happy
to have his first grandchild.

1:10:59.593 --> 1:11:01.793
Yes, then,
Woosung's father, go this way...

1:11:02.553 --> 1:11:03.813
Oh, yes.

1:11:06.563 --> 1:11:09.703
<i>Gosh, that bastard, he
plays soccer all the time...</i>

1:11:10.293 --> 1:11:13.903
That's why the owner always squeaks.

1:11:13.903 --> 1:11:16.003
Let's get serious.

1:11:16.013 --> 1:11:18.363
- Let's go get serious.
- What wrong with him and how...

1:11:22.353 --> 1:11:24.053
Thank you for taking care of Woosung.

1:11:25.083 --> 1:11:29.133
Well, babies have a fever
and then they grow up.

1:11:30.583 --> 1:11:32.973
If I were alone,
I wouldn't be able to do anything.

1:11:34.003 --> 1:11:37.483
If you insist, well,
you don't have to do it all by yourself.

1:11:42.193 --> 1:11:44.763
The father...

1:11:45.713 --> 1:11:46.863
of Woosung.

1:11:47.513 --> 1:11:49.203
I was against it from the beginning.

1:11:51.923 --> 1:11:54.453
I see, that's...

1:12:23.923 --> 1:12:27.073
She probably ran away with the baby.

1:12:28.033 --> 1:12:29.573
Find her and bring her back.

1:12:31.223 --> 1:12:32.363
This woman?

1:12:33.213 --> 1:12:34.323
The baby.

1:12:36.553 --> 1:12:38.493
What are you going to do with the baby?

1:12:42.783 --> 1:12:44.083
I'm going to raise him.

1:12:44.823 --> 1:12:45.773
I will.

1:12:46.613 --> 1:12:48.343
Because he's my husband's child.

1:12:58.543 --> 1:13:01.893
It's fully automatic?
Are you kidding me...

1:13:03.143 --> 1:13:05.153
How do you do this?

1:13:17.863 --> 1:13:19.203
Yes, Taeho?

1:13:19.543 --> 1:13:23.123
Oh, I'm sorry but
I'll rush the money.

1:13:27.253 --> 1:13:28.383
What?

1:13:28.933 --> 1:13:31.173
Baby? Who, who?

1:13:35.403 --> 1:13:37.013
Woosung's father?

1:13:38.363 --> 1:13:39.563
How much?

1:13:41.733 --> 1:13:42.973
Four thousand?

1:13:48.333 --> 1:13:50.153
He's totally asleep.

1:13:52.043 --> 1:13:53.463
He must have been tired.

1:13:54.203 --> 1:13:56.823
You've been paying attention to
him for sleeping all day.

1:14:00.573 --> 1:14:02.463
He look like Siwoo, this guy.

1:14:04.623 --> 1:14:07.293
These types don't sell
well and are left behind.

1:14:09.913 --> 1:14:12.593
Didn't you want to be adopted?

1:14:15.473 --> 1:14:17.513
I really liked it there.

1:14:18.113 --> 1:14:20.353
That's why I refused to talk about adoption.

1:14:22.143 --> 1:14:23.983
Because your mom said she'd pick you up?

1:14:27.943 --> 1:14:29.773
What else did hyung talk about?

1:14:31.083 --> 1:14:33.993
Well, about the letter.

1:14:37.423 --> 1:14:40.203
'Cause I never thought
I'd be abandoned

1:14:47.503 --> 1:14:48.923
He fell asleep.

1:14:52.153 --> 1:14:53.343
Do you want to try?

1:14:53.743 --> 1:14:56.053
Please just do me a favor.

1:14:58.423 --> 1:15:00.933
Chin, put his chin on your shoulder.

1:15:01.043 --> 1:15:02.723
I know it, too.

1:15:03.603 --> 1:15:05.933
- No, a little higher.
- I said I know.

1:15:06.863 --> 1:15:09.103
- Hey, you're too weak...
- Gosh, you're loud, a little...

1:15:14.133 --> 1:15:16.403
You're not taking care of
Woosung on purpose, are you?

1:15:16.863 --> 1:15:18.013
What?

1:15:21.143 --> 1:15:22.953
I'm afraid you won't be able to part later.

1:15:29.363 --> 1:15:30.633
Why are you laughing?

1:15:31.883 --> 1:15:35.213
Then it's perfect to be beaten up by a girl.

1:15:38.413 --> 1:15:40.593
Why are you saying the same thing as hyung?

1:15:57.933 --> 1:15:59.033
Where are you going?

1:15:59.303 --> 1:16:00.363
Convenience store.

1:16:00.613 --> 1:16:01.783
Shall I go instead?

1:16:02.123 --> 1:16:05.883
There are things that
women can't ask others to do.

1:16:06.823 --> 1:16:09.833
It might rain
Take an umbrella.

1:16:11.003 --> 1:16:12.673
Then come and pick me up if it rains.

1:16:15.223 --> 1:16:16.463
With an umbrella.

1:16:20.773 --> 1:16:21.933
I don't want to.

1:16:23.043 --> 1:16:24.973
I'll be back.

1:16:32.883 --> 1:16:35.023
Where did you meet that mother?

1:16:36.833 --> 1:16:39.613
I was sleeping at Songdo beach
after running away from home,

1:16:39.883 --> 1:16:41.653
and she told me to come if I was hungry.

1:16:43.863 --> 1:16:46.553
And then you were forced to prostitute yourself?

1:16:51.213 --> 1:16:53.273
Are you looking at me pitifully?

1:16:55.463 --> 1:16:58.883
- No, that's not it...
- I did it even before I met his mom.

1:17:00.173 --> 1:17:03.013
Then why did you kill him?

1:17:04.763 --> 1:17:06.153
It's just because...

1:17:06.953 --> 1:17:08.053
in a fit of rage?

1:17:09.433 --> 1:17:10.643
in a fit of rage?

1:17:11.423 --> 1:17:14.653
Even before I take a shower,
He's telling me to lick it, what a crazy bastard...

1:17:16.313 --> 1:17:19.493
So, the other person first...
I mean, self-defense or...

1:17:19.493 --> 1:17:22.453
If you want to know the list of
other customers, I can let you know.

1:17:25.183 --> 1:17:28.033
That's enough
All I want to know is...

1:17:28.033 --> 1:17:30.413
Is this an interrogation? Or a sermon?

1:17:30.723 --> 1:17:33.603
As you said, the baby
will be sold, so don't worry.

1:17:35.003 --> 1:17:38.423
I want to help, both me
and my team leader...

1:17:42.523 --> 1:17:44.463
Have you ever abandoned a child?

1:17:44.853 --> 1:17:46.603
Have you ever killed someone?

1:17:47.293 --> 1:17:50.893
Okay, then tell me,
because I don't understand.

1:17:53.743 --> 1:17:57.023
Why did you throw him away?
Outside the church.

1:18:02.633 --> 1:18:03.743
Did you see that?

1:18:08.143 --> 1:18:10.243
If you left him like that, he'd be dead.

1:18:13.523 --> 1:18:15.743
Because I didn't want to see him again.

1:18:17.013 --> 1:18:18.833
Why did you give birth to him
if you couldn't raise him?

1:18:19.613 --> 1:18:21.133
I should've abort him?

1:18:21.163 --> 1:18:24.373
If you think about the child,
Isn't there an option like that?

1:18:26.563 --> 1:18:29.723
Rather than throwing him away after giving birth,
Killing him before I give birth...

1:18:30.523 --> 1:18:31.973
Is that crime more lighter?

1:18:39.193 --> 1:18:40.273
Well...

1:18:41.263 --> 1:18:44.073
No one wants to be born

1:18:44.633 --> 1:18:46.903
- Isn't the baby more unfortunate?
- I should have killed him before he was born.

1:18:46.903 --> 1:18:48.913
- You talk like that in front of Woosung.
- Stop, stop!

1:18:48.913 --> 1:18:51.243
What do you mean by throwing him away?

1:19:29.233 --> 1:19:30.393
Yes.

1:19:33.603 --> 1:19:35.143
Oh, you know...

1:19:36.503 --> 1:19:40.423
Can you bring me some clothes?
My buttons fell off.

1:19:41.923 --> 1:19:44.753
Yes, in Uljin.

1:19:51.483 --> 1:19:52.663
Isn't it?

1:19:57.253 --> 1:19:59.103
No, that's fine.

1:20:02.803 --> 1:20:05.943
Look at this, look at this,
listen to this song for a second.

1:20:16.333 --> 1:20:20.003
Hello? Oh, can you hear this?
Do you remember this?

1:20:20.003 --> 1:20:22.463
In the movie we saw together...

1:20:23.373 --> 1:20:25.003
that comes out...

1:20:29.903 --> 1:20:31.303
Right.

1:20:33.273 --> 1:20:37.353
In reality, well,
That's not gonna happen.

1:20:43.563 --> 1:20:45.693
Rice? What's with rice?

1:20:45.693 --> 1:20:47.403
Oh, like that wedding?

1:20:48.133 --> 1:20:49.403
I see.

1:20:56.963 --> 1:20:59.123
No, I don't think so?

1:21:03.573 --> 1:21:04.713
Sorry.

1:21:13.243 --> 1:21:14.503
It's just.

1:21:26.583 --> 1:21:28.363
Poke it outside.

1:21:29.233 --> 1:21:32.143
Look under the button like this.

1:21:33.333 --> 1:21:36.823
If you spin it a few times,
and you roll it like this,

1:21:37.043 --> 1:21:38.083
It's not coming off well.

1:21:38.263 --> 1:21:39.873
Wow, Dongsoo-hyung,
How do you do that?

1:21:39.873 --> 1:21:41.663
- Hey, Hae-jin, you should try it too.
- I want to do it too.

1:21:42.153 --> 1:21:43.423
Give it a try.

1:21:43.653 --> 1:21:45.253
No, I'm going to do this.

1:21:50.353 --> 1:21:53.343
But what kind of person
are you going to meet tomorrow?

1:21:53.913 --> 1:21:55.973
Of course, a rich person.

1:21:56.723 --> 1:21:59.313
If you spend that 40 million won like this...

1:21:59.313 --> 1:22:00.513
It's 30 million.

1:22:00.653 --> 1:22:03.823
Ah, right, true, true
30 million, 30, 30.

1:22:04.603 --> 1:22:07.173
Why? What kind of person do you want?

1:22:08.223 --> 1:22:10.403
Someone as pretty as Soyoung-nuna.

1:22:11.743 --> 1:22:15.113
Hey, Dongsu. Learn something, learn.

1:22:15.723 --> 1:22:18.873
You shouldn't let a man
say such empty words, man.

1:22:18.873 --> 1:22:21.663
Oh my, I've learned a few things, Master.

1:22:21.693 --> 1:22:22.823
<i>What?</i>

1:22:23.243 --> 1:22:24.713
<i>I couldn't hear you well.</i>

1:22:25.443 --> 1:22:29.323
In the old days, it was said that the eldest son resembles
the mother and the eldest daughter resembles the father.

1:22:29.323 --> 1:22:31.253
And so our house is ruined.

1:22:32.143 --> 1:22:34.263
It's okay, we don't live together.

1:22:34.763 --> 1:22:36.833
All of that is superstition.

1:22:37.033 --> 1:22:40.263
Oh, she's the eldest, eldest.

1:22:40.263 --> 1:22:41.103
You're noisy.

1:22:41.103 --> 1:22:44.483
Whenever I look at my
mom's pictures, I'm surprised

1:22:44.483 --> 1:22:45.713
I thought it was me.

1:22:48.463 --> 1:22:50.483
The button was about to fall off.

1:22:50.483 --> 1:22:52.323
Here you go.

1:22:57.523 --> 1:22:58.643
Where are you going?

1:22:58.693 --> 1:23:00.043
To wash up.

1:23:05.813 --> 1:23:07.293
That guy, too

1:23:08.773 --> 1:23:10.403
He don't know his parents' faces, really...

1:23:12.193 --> 1:23:13.823
Living without knowing...

1:23:15.153 --> 1:23:17.303
There are cases like that.

1:23:24.313 --> 1:23:28.563
It'd would be better if
Woosung doesn't know my face.

1:23:31.403 --> 1:23:32.713
Why did you think so?

1:23:36.513 --> 1:23:37.823
Because I'm a murderer.

1:23:40.103 --> 1:23:41.293
Murderer?

1:23:42.563 --> 1:23:43.583
Yes.

1:23:46.153 --> 1:23:47.453
You killed who?

1:23:50.193 --> 1:23:51.543
Woo-sung's father.

1:23:56.563 --> 1:23:57.633
Why?

1:24:06.043 --> 1:24:08.683
He shouldn't have been born like this.

1:24:10.393 --> 1:24:11.993
I was going to take Woosung away.

1:24:16.483 --> 1:24:17.443
What?

1:24:20.523 --> 1:24:23.623
His wife is probably after me by now.

1:24:28.523 --> 1:24:32.673
So if you're going to sell him properly,
you can leave me behind.

1:24:42.833 --> 1:24:44.723
Oh, I'm out of the motel right now.

1:24:45.903 --> 1:24:47.853
Oh, and now, wait a minute.

1:24:48.063 --> 1:24:49.743
Oh, wait.

1:24:52.083 --> 1:24:54.003
Let me ask you something.

1:24:54.383 --> 1:24:55.483
Hyung!

1:24:59.253 --> 1:25:00.493
What are you doing here?

1:25:01.163 --> 1:25:05.373
No, what Soyoung said yesterday
was on my mind, so I looked here.

1:25:06.613 --> 1:25:07.743
This...

1:25:07.853 --> 1:25:09.043
What is this?

1:25:10.853 --> 1:25:14.003
Is this a GPS or something,
where did you find this?

1:25:14.303 --> 1:25:15.673
Here.

1:25:18.763 --> 1:25:19.693
A police?

1:25:20.563 --> 1:25:23.623
The police don't use old items
like this these days.

1:25:24.813 --> 1:25:27.973
So you're saying
they've been following us.

1:25:28.413 --> 1:25:29.683
Don't you think so?

1:25:29.863 --> 1:25:32.293
That Woosung's paternal side.

1:25:36.963 --> 1:25:38.193
I can't.

1:25:38.193 --> 1:25:39.113
What?

1:25:39.803 --> 1:25:42.493
Hyung, you're thinking of
leaving Soyoung here now.

1:25:43.533 --> 1:25:44.973
That...

1:25:47.953 --> 1:25:51.903
This time, It's not money but
something Soyoung can understand.

1:25:53.003 --> 1:25:55.083
Let's find such a buyer together.

1:25:56.303 --> 1:26:00.093
Hey dude, no matter what,
money isn't everything

1:26:01.153 --> 1:26:02.423
Then, that's good to hear.

1:26:04.173 --> 1:26:05.803
Then I'll take care of this myself.

1:26:09.293 --> 1:26:10.393
What?

1:26:11.973 --> 1:26:13.353
what are you doing now?

1:26:38.473 --> 1:26:40.253
I know everything though.

1:26:40.693 --> 1:26:43.343
Woosung's father is dead.

1:26:44.433 --> 1:26:47.363
So what?
You just need to get paid.

1:26:50.033 --> 1:26:53.353
I mean, who the hell is
trying to save Woosung?

1:26:56.833 --> 1:26:58.133
A dead man's wife.

1:26:59.003 --> 1:27:00.363
What is she going to do after buying him?

1:27:02.233 --> 1:27:03.873
She wanted to raise him.

1:27:03.873 --> 1:27:06.653
She's going to raise him?
Let's not talk nonsense.

1:27:06.783 --> 1:27:08.613
You're trying to sell him out, aren't you?

1:27:09.113 --> 1:27:12.063
To that foreign country, overseas, huh?
I will never sell him.

1:27:13.393 --> 1:27:15.273
Get out, Mister. Get out!

1:27:15.683 --> 1:27:17.063
Hey, hey!

1:27:18.813 --> 1:27:20.083
Who are you?

1:27:21.193 --> 1:27:22.423
I see.

1:27:23.493 --> 1:27:25.083
Are you on Woosung's father side?

1:27:25.203 --> 1:27:28.093
Shut up, give the kid to me.
Hey, you're not coming out? Get out! Get out!

1:27:39.373 --> 1:27:41.553
Hey, hey, hey!

1:27:43.963 --> 1:27:46.193
Hey, aren't he dead?

1:27:47.693 --> 1:27:50.213
Hey, it's the son of my acquiantance, man!

1:27:50.773 --> 1:27:52.573
It's okay. He just passed out.

1:27:58.003 --> 1:27:59.103
Let's do it together.

1:28:18.023 --> 1:28:19.663
Where are you going now?

1:28:19.893 --> 1:28:22.953
Oh, that's along this road.
We're heading south.

1:28:22.953 --> 1:28:25.143
I think I can catch up
with it in about 5km.

1:28:25.393 --> 1:28:27.183
- Speed ​​it up.
- Yeah.

1:28:27.233 --> 1:28:28.323
I let my guard down.

1:29:13.753 --> 1:29:14.783
Yeah.

1:29:16.533 --> 1:29:17.873
I had a dream.

1:29:20.053 --> 1:29:22.753
Once upon a time, with my daughter

1:29:23.573 --> 1:29:27.423
I rode this together with my wife
and mom and went to Wolmi.

1:29:28.993 --> 1:29:30.303
Then that...

1:29:30.303 --> 1:29:31.553
What a nice dream.

1:29:31.993 --> 1:29:34.343
No, not really.

1:29:40.943 --> 1:29:44.063
Why do you think she taught it on purpose?

1:29:44.963 --> 1:29:46.883
- The destination?
- Yes.

1:29:50.733 --> 1:29:52.903
I guess she wants me to follow her.

1:29:53.873 --> 1:29:57.573
You mean not to lose Woosung?

1:30:00.563 --> 1:30:02.503
That's what she thinks.

1:30:17.613 --> 1:30:18.933
Are you gonna be okay?

1:30:19.583 --> 1:30:20.973
It's on me.

1:30:22.423 --> 1:30:23.553
It's not that.

1:30:27.173 --> 1:30:29.483
I'm just going to go by myself if I have to.

1:30:31.723 --> 1:30:33.243
Even so, that's fine.

1:30:34.153 --> 1:30:35.953
As long as it's not like installments
or anything like that.

1:30:38.233 --> 1:30:39.933
- Soyoung-ah
- Yes?

1:30:41.893 --> 1:30:45.663
Do you perhaps...
You know, you put Woosung in the box.

1:30:47.773 --> 1:30:52.503
I mean, were you really going
to pick him up again?

1:30:59.633 --> 1:31:00.853
No?

1:31:03.183 --> 1:31:04.603
I don't know.

1:31:08.253 --> 1:31:09.603
But...

1:31:11.793 --> 1:31:14.483
If we had met a little earlier,

1:31:17.273 --> 1:31:19.393
I wouldn't have to throw him away...

1:31:23.713 --> 1:31:25.323
It's not too late.

1:31:26.933 --> 1:31:28.623
Oh? What did you say?

1:31:30.493 --> 1:31:31.753
Oh, nothing.

1:31:36.953 --> 1:31:40.443
Mister Sanghyun is the only one who
has Soyoung. You're too mean.

1:31:41.233 --> 1:31:43.723
Is that so? Well then, touch the baton.

1:31:49.913 --> 1:31:51.893
What kind of man do you like nuna?

1:31:52.713 --> 1:31:53.733
What?

1:31:56.933 --> 1:31:58.153
I'm not sure.

1:31:59.163 --> 1:32:01.793
A man who looks good
with suspenders like Haejin?

1:32:05.653 --> 1:32:08.833
Haejin... that's such a good name.

1:32:09.823 --> 1:32:11.423
I like your name.

1:32:12.083 --> 1:32:14.093
That means heading to the sea, right?

1:32:15.263 --> 1:32:19.323
When you become an adult,
I'm sure you'll be working abroad.

1:32:20.153 --> 1:32:22.103
In the Premier League?

1:32:23.933 --> 1:32:24.973
Yeah.

1:32:27.753 --> 1:32:29.853
Who named Woosung?

1:32:30.383 --> 1:32:31.593
Me.

1:32:31.663 --> 1:32:32.983
I envy him.

1:32:33.783 --> 1:32:36.113
What does Woosung mean?

1:32:41.763 --> 1:32:43.953
Woo means wings

1:32:44.193 --> 1:32:45.473
Sung means star.

1:32:46.183 --> 1:32:48.633
It means I want him to go far away.

1:32:49.083 --> 1:32:52.213
If Haejin is heading to the sea,
then Woosung is over there.

1:32:52.413 --> 1:32:55.003
Beyond the sky to the stars like this?

1:32:55.503 --> 1:32:57.003
Like an astronaut?

1:32:57.863 --> 1:32:59.113
Or maybe a pilot?

1:33:00.823 --> 1:33:02.343
You two look like siblings.

1:33:29.153 --> 1:33:30.343
Oh yes, hello?

1:33:30.403 --> 1:33:33.853
Well, I'd like to have an hour or
two of your appointment.

1:33:34.123 --> 1:33:36.583
I'll see you at 12, yeah, yeah.

1:33:36.583 --> 1:33:38.003
I got it, yes.

1:33:46.153 --> 1:33:48.183
Today's star is Woosung.

1:33:49.183 --> 1:33:50.393
Understand?

1:33:50.643 --> 1:33:54.003
- If you adopt me too...
- No, never.

1:34:06.973 --> 1:34:11.383
Ah, like this, we thank you
so much for doing us a favor.

1:34:12.603 --> 1:34:15.003
I've already told you this but,

1:34:17.163 --> 1:34:20.463
My wife had a stillbirth...

1:34:21.193 --> 1:34:23.513
I don't want to think about the next time...

1:34:23.513 --> 1:34:26.633
Yes, it must have been very difficult.

1:34:27.893 --> 1:34:29.643
It's a girl.

1:34:30.673 --> 1:34:33.433
She was a cute baby that looked like him...

1:34:34.503 --> 1:34:37.023
Oh, let's sit down and
have some coffee...

1:34:37.063 --> 1:34:38.613
Oh, how about ice coffee?

1:34:39.713 --> 1:34:40.653
Sure.

1:34:42.403 --> 1:34:46.533
Can I give him a hug?

1:34:46.533 --> 1:34:48.033
Oh of course, yes.

1:34:48.033 --> 1:34:49.323
Excuse me...

1:34:50.373 --> 1:34:52.913
Yes, iced coffee.

1:34:52.913 --> 1:34:54.623
- One, two, three...
- Woo Sung-ah.

1:34:59.893 --> 1:35:01.543
It's okay, I'm not scary.

1:35:01.683 --> 1:35:03.003
Is it because he's hungry?

1:35:03.023 --> 1:35:05.113
- Get some formula.
- Are you hungry?

1:35:05.193 --> 1:35:08.623
- Oh, yes.
- If you're okay with that...

1:35:08.623 --> 1:35:11.393
Do you mind if I try to breastfeed him?

1:35:12.503 --> 1:35:14.103
- Is that fine, right?
- Yes.

1:35:14.403 --> 1:35:17.143
Yeah, then, I... there, yeah

1:35:17.143 --> 1:35:19.943
- Thank you.
- Yes, thank you.

1:35:21.733 --> 1:35:22.943
Woo Sung-ah.

1:35:23.883 --> 1:35:27.323
It's okay, it's okay.

1:35:29.263 --> 1:35:30.703
Oh, how...

1:35:34.643 --> 1:35:36.703
Drink it, drink, yeah
yeah, drink it.

1:35:38.733 --> 1:35:40.083
Oh my, good.

1:35:41.323 --> 1:35:43.043
Oh my, it's delicious.

1:35:49.103 --> 1:35:52.013
I didn't write in the email though

1:35:52.623 --> 1:35:54.413
Can I suggest something?

1:35:55.673 --> 1:35:57.443
Thinking about the future...

1:35:58.383 --> 1:36:01.153
I want to raise Woosung as my own child.

1:36:02.303 --> 1:36:05.703
So, with this as the last thing,

1:36:06.573 --> 1:36:09.953
I don't want him to meet his biological mom.

1:36:11.183 --> 1:36:12.703
It will be hard

1:36:12.973 --> 1:36:16.293
but hink about it slowly today.

1:36:29.323 --> 1:36:31.633
Nuna, nuna, here,
here, here, here.

1:36:43.633 --> 1:36:45.113
Wow, it came out good.

1:36:45.113 --> 1:36:46.513
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1:36:54.443 --> 1:36:57.833
It's a monorail, bye!

1:36:58.923 --> 1:37:00.353
Bye!

1:37:06.853 --> 1:37:10.423
Let's take a picture here! Let's
take a picture, let's take a picture!

1:37:10.873 --> 1:37:12.133
Come on in, quickly.

1:37:13.963 --> 1:37:15.263
Do you have money?

1:37:17.473 --> 1:37:18.603
4,000 won.

1:37:24.583 --> 1:37:26.153
What prize do you want?

1:37:26.153 --> 1:37:28.023
No, not yet. Not yet.
I haven't done it yet.

1:37:28.023 --> 1:37:28.973
Wait, wait.

1:37:28.973 --> 1:37:30.493
A monkey doll, a monkey doll!

1:37:30.493 --> 1:37:31.613
- Monkey doll!
- I'm in trouble.

1:37:32.283 --> 1:37:34.573
I can't get it wrong, can I?

1:37:36.473 --> 1:37:37.083
Wait, wait.

1:37:37.083 --> 1:37:38.533
- I'll try it one more time.
- Come on! Go! Go! Go!

1:37:38.533 --> 1:37:39.703
I want to do it too.

1:37:44.543 --> 1:37:47.873
Haejin-ah, there's a soccer field
Look.

1:37:47.883 --> 1:37:49.133
- Yes.
- What?

1:37:49.643 --> 1:37:51.623
- There's a socced field over there.
- Yes.

1:37:52.903 --> 1:37:56.803
I'm afraid right now
because I'm scared of heights.

1:37:57.103 --> 1:38:00.683
Hey, kid. I mean, you
said you wanted to ride this.

1:38:01.343 --> 1:38:02.903
Back then, it was just...

1:38:02.903 --> 1:38:05.613
Hey, what's wrong with your face?

1:38:05.843 --> 1:38:07.733
Hey, aren't you vomiting?

1:38:07.733 --> 1:38:10.443
Why are you so blue?
Are you okay?

1:38:10.963 --> 1:38:12.893
- Hey, you can't vomit.
- Yes.

1:38:12.943 --> 1:38:13.993
- Got it?
- Yes.

1:38:14.713 --> 1:38:16.573
- You can't vomit here.
- Yeah.

1:38:17.043 --> 1:38:20.873
Gosh, this kid, really. I wanted
to be nice to you, but...

1:38:21.193 --> 1:38:22.953
Take me there, please.

1:38:23.103 --> 1:38:24.973
- To where?
- New car...

1:38:24.983 --> 1:38:26.963
- What?
- New car...

1:38:26.963 --> 1:38:28.803
- A new conductor? New car?
- Yes.

1:38:29.363 --> 1:38:31.553
You mean, with that water on top.
You like that?

1:38:31.553 --> 1:38:32.513
Yes.

1:38:34.093 --> 1:38:38.223
Yeah, let's go again when
things go well tomorrow.

1:38:38.863 --> 1:38:40.183
- When we have arrived...
- Yes.

1:38:40.183 --> 1:38:41.143
Let me know.

1:38:41.143 --> 1:38:42.813
Sure.

1:38:43.293 --> 1:38:45.143
- Don't vomit.
- Yeah.

1:38:45.293 --> 1:38:47.303
This kid, really...

1:39:03.883 --> 1:39:05.543
Should we look for more?

1:39:10.923 --> 1:39:14.443
Or you can quit.
You can send him for adoption.

1:39:18.573 --> 1:39:19.833
But still...

1:39:22.463 --> 1:39:23.773
Then...

1:39:24.793 --> 1:39:26.483
We can raise him.

1:39:30.443 --> 1:39:31.583
We?

1:39:33.563 --> 1:39:34.693
The four of us...

1:39:36.713 --> 1:39:39.913
Five of us, including Haejin, sounds good.

1:39:43.153 --> 1:39:46.953
What a weird family.
Whose father is whose dad?

1:39:53.243 --> 1:39:54.973
Of couse, I'm Woosung's dad.

1:40:00.033 --> 1:40:02.763
But that's what people
usually say when they propose?

1:40:04.993 --> 1:40:06.113
Is that so?

1:40:17.613 --> 1:40:20.643
I wish I could
start over like that.

1:40:34.823 --> 1:40:36.383
But it won't work.

1:40:39.163 --> 1:40:41.263
I'll be arrested soon.

1:40:48.073 --> 1:40:50.853
Moon Mo, a prostitute from Busan

1:40:50.893 --> 1:40:53.283
She killed a man and ran away.

1:40:54.413 --> 1:40:57.573
When the baby gets in the way,
she dumps it in the baby box.

1:41:10.403 --> 1:41:11.963
Does it come out like this?

1:41:15.933 --> 1:41:18.343
They don't blur face these days.

1:41:21.143 --> 1:41:22.393
Is that so?

1:41:29.083 --> 1:41:31.063
It shook a bit, right?

1:41:33.673 --> 1:41:36.813
It's okay, it's because we're at the top.

1:41:40.223 --> 1:41:42.783
I'm scared because
I can't see anything

1:41:44.203 --> 1:41:45.413
Strangely...

1:42:01.233 --> 1:42:04.133
Seeing you makes my
heart feel a little more at ease.

1:42:06.563 --> 1:42:07.683
Why is that?

1:42:09.203 --> 1:42:10.523
My mother also...

1:42:13.043 --> 1:42:16.273
She had no choice. I think that there
must be a reason why she had to abandon me.

1:42:26.893 --> 1:42:28.203
Still...

1:42:30.983 --> 1:42:33.373
You don't have to forgive her.

1:42:35.523 --> 1:42:38.673
Because it doesn't change the
fact that she's a bad mother.

1:42:47.533 --> 1:42:48.673
That's why

1:42:51.403 --> 1:42:53.353
Instead, I will forgive Soyoung.

1:43:07.603 --> 1:43:10.073
Woosung will never forgive me.

1:43:15.963 --> 1:43:17.393
The reason I threw Woosung away

1:43:19.253 --> 1:43:22.093
It's because I don't want to
make Woosung as the murderer's child.

1:43:29.573 --> 1:43:30.883
But still

1:43:34.313 --> 1:43:36.293
The fact that I abandoned him  is just the same.

1:43:57.403 --> 1:44:00.543
I guess I was the one who
wanted to sell him the most.

1:44:05.203 --> 1:44:07.303
We're more like brokers.

1:44:28.083 --> 1:44:31.033
Was it when you were young?

1:44:31.033 --> 1:44:32.533
Back then I took you into my arms...

1:44:33.133 --> 1:44:35.033
You almost threw up, but...

1:44:35.263 --> 1:44:38.203
You didn't throw up.
You was in my stomach.

1:44:38.993 --> 1:44:42.883
I don't remember, I
was three years old back then.

1:44:44.963 --> 1:44:46.683
Has it been that long?

1:44:49.283 --> 1:44:53.143
Hey, how can you solve such a
difficult problem already like this?

1:44:59.053 --> 1:45:01.643
Why? Who is it?

1:45:02.053 --> 1:45:03.233
Mom.

1:45:03.673 --> 1:45:04.903
Why? Answer her.

1:45:05.463 --> 1:45:07.563
Oh? Is it a text?

1:45:07.733 --> 1:45:09.193
Then reply her back.

1:45:09.633 --> 1:45:11.613
Should we take a selfie and
send it to your mom?

1:45:11.853 --> 1:45:12.663
It's fine.

1:45:12.663 --> 1:45:15.283
Here's your order,
Enjoy your meal.

1:45:17.183 --> 1:45:19.163
Eat it. It looks delicious.

1:45:22.093 --> 1:45:26.423
Dad will have a lot of money
coming in tomorrow.

1:45:27.423 --> 1:45:31.223
Then like in the past, with mom and I

1:45:31.303 --> 1:45:33.393
The three of us in Busan

1:45:34.503 --> 1:45:37.053
Oh, Daddy can come to Seoul...

1:45:38.703 --> 1:45:43.463
Now that you have money,
please don't contact me again.

1:45:45.013 --> 1:45:47.413
That's what mom said.

1:45:50.163 --> 1:45:51.413
Mom...

1:45:54.733 --> 1:45:58.413
But she told me you don't
ever come back home again.

1:46:02.463 --> 1:46:05.883
Last time, daddy was so drunk.

1:46:06.153 --> 1:46:09.343
Oh, this straw is...

1:46:09.973 --> 1:46:11.673
a heart, it's shaped like a heart.

1:46:14.723 --> 1:46:16.053
You know...

1:46:17.463 --> 1:46:19.643
Mom's baby will be born.

1:46:22.653 --> 1:46:23.813
Mom?

1:46:25.043 --> 1:46:27.813
Yes, it's a boy.

1:46:32.973 --> 1:46:34.493
Oh, I see.

1:46:37.963 --> 1:46:41.203
Well, then
tell your mom congratulations...

1:46:43.213 --> 1:46:44.543
Sorry.

1:46:46.183 --> 1:46:47.653
Oh, it's nothing.

1:46:50.573 --> 1:46:55.723
But still, I'll continue to be Yoona's dad.

1:46:56.433 --> 1:46:57.233
Right?

1:46:59.643 --> 1:47:00.753
Really?

1:47:06.533 --> 1:47:07.603
Of course.

1:47:10.803 --> 1:47:12.233
I'll go now.

1:47:15.913 --> 1:47:17.103
See you again.

1:48:02.623 --> 1:48:05.793
Steak, steak...

1:48:05.793 --> 1:48:07.373
Should I try it?

1:48:08.173 --> 1:48:11.503
Anyway, I wish you
success tomorrow..

1:48:11.503 --> 1:48:12.303
Here.

1:48:13.303 --> 1:48:14.553
Here...

1:48:22.413 --> 1:48:24.853
Woo Sung-ah, say "Hae-jin hyung".

1:48:24.853 --> 1:48:26.723
Hae-jin hyung, Hae-jin hyung.

1:48:28.433 --> 1:48:30.063
Oh! Haejin said it!

1:48:30.993 --> 1:48:32.343
You must have done that.

1:48:33.333 --> 1:48:36.823
- Woo Sung-ah, did you? Right?
- That's right, I did.

1:48:37.593 --> 1:48:41.033
Woosung, we must never forget it.

1:48:41.663 --> 1:48:43.133
He'll forget it soon.

1:48:44.293 --> 1:48:48.303
Haejin did Woosung's part
You just have to remember everything.

1:48:49.713 --> 1:48:53.663
Gosh, this kid, no matter how you look at,
He's really unfortunate.

1:48:53.673 --> 1:48:55.213
I totally agree.

1:48:57.343 --> 1:49:00.183
Woosung, I had so much fun today.

1:49:00.813 --> 1:49:03.843
So let's not forget it in future.

1:49:05.303 --> 1:49:09.023
You doesn't talk to Woosung.

1:49:10.983 --> 1:49:12.283
No, it's not?

1:49:12.663 --> 1:49:15.613
No, I've never seen it.

1:49:18.523 --> 1:49:20.243
Today's the last day.
Say something to him.

1:49:22.363 --> 1:49:23.953
What do you want me to say?

1:49:25.833 --> 1:49:27.673
Well, anything.

1:49:29.573 --> 1:49:32.293
Well, "Thank you for being born", like that.

1:49:33.203 --> 1:49:35.043
You know, that kind of words, why?

1:49:37.133 --> 1:49:39.023
He don't even understand anything.

1:49:39.023 --> 1:49:40.513
Even if he don't understand...

1:49:41.683 --> 1:49:44.843
Since Woosung was born,
He want to hear that at least once.

1:49:55.713 --> 1:49:59.983
Nuna, then tell us everything here.

1:50:00.843 --> 1:50:02.403
- Everyhing?
- Yes.

1:50:03.243 --> 1:50:05.493
- All of these here?
- Yes!

1:50:06.293 --> 1:50:07.993
That stupid kid.

1:50:08.523 --> 1:50:09.663
I'll pass.

1:50:10.603 --> 1:50:11.503
What?

1:50:11.503 --> 1:50:13.293
If she talked first to him...

1:50:15.553 --> 1:50:17.503
Then I'll pass, too.

1:50:25.723 --> 1:50:27.683
Okay, I'll talk to him.

1:50:30.753 --> 1:50:32.523
Everyone close your eyes, then.

1:50:34.133 --> 1:50:35.563
Come on, wait, wait!

1:50:37.653 --> 1:50:38.903
Let's turn off the lights.

1:50:40.193 --> 1:50:42.573
What, hey!

1:50:42.623 --> 1:50:44.833
If you turn off the lights,
How can I eat my steak...

1:50:44.973 --> 1:50:47.493
Hey! Don't turn off the lights.

1:50:48.493 --> 1:50:50.283
Don't turn off the lights...

1:50:54.073 --> 1:50:56.303
Then, I'll start.

1:51:01.363 --> 1:51:05.883
Haejin-ah, thank you for being born.

1:51:10.503 --> 1:51:11.813
Sang Hyun-ah.

1:51:14.793 --> 1:51:16.733
Thank you for being born.

1:51:19.813 --> 1:51:21.193
Dongsu.

1:51:24.503 --> 1:51:26.323
Thank you for being born.

1:51:31.433 --> 1:51:32.703
Woo Sung-ah

1:51:36.363 --> 1:51:38.193
Thank you...

1:51:41.113 --> 1:51:42.293
...for being born.

1:51:45.333 --> 1:51:46.593
So Young-ah

1:51:51.183 --> 1:51:53.683
Soyoung, thank you for being born, too.

1:52:05.843 --> 1:52:08.783
Then, everyone, sleep well.

1:52:10.253 --> 1:52:11.453
Good night.

1:52:51.813 --> 1:52:53.703
I'll make a suggestion.

1:52:59.743 --> 1:53:01.923
Let's say you turn yourself in here.

1:53:03.883 --> 1:53:04.843
What?

1:53:05.503 --> 1:53:08.843
Woosung, well...
You don't have to go sell him anymore.

1:53:10.143 --> 1:53:12.553
What, you said to sold him
and now not to sell him?

1:53:13.433 --> 1:53:15.393
If you turn yourself in and go into injury,

1:53:15.393 --> 1:53:18.643
If things go well, you'll be on parole
for the first time in three years.

1:53:20.463 --> 1:53:23.943
Then you can live together
with Woosung again someday.

1:53:27.683 --> 1:53:29.243
Those two people,

1:53:29.813 --> 1:53:32.473
Unfortunately, they can't be parents.

1:53:34.833 --> 1:53:36.223
So do I.

1:53:38.693 --> 1:53:40.873
The couple I met today was like that.

1:53:43.583 --> 1:53:46.503
Woosung is not an abandoned
child, but a protected child.

1:53:48.013 --> 1:53:50.443
They'll tell them like that, every day.
They're going to raise him.

1:53:53.613 --> 1:53:56.683
I hope Woosung grows up
under such people

1:54:01.083 --> 1:54:02.303
Then...

1:54:08.643 --> 1:54:09.953
...then

1:54:12.653 --> 1:54:14.813
He don't have to live like me.

1:54:37.563 --> 1:54:38.673
Where are you going?

1:54:43.083 --> 1:54:44.433
Soyoung isn't here either.

1:54:45.343 --> 1:54:49.443
Soyoung is outside right now
She's probably meeting with the detectives.

1:54:51.683 --> 1:54:53.943
Soyoung is not the type to turn us out.

1:54:54.103 --> 1:54:56.493
No, it can happen.

1:54:57.433 --> 1:55:00.333
If it's for Woosung,
She'll do anything.

1:55:02.343 --> 1:55:03.483
But,

1:55:04.873 --> 1:55:06.253
She can do that.

1:55:11.583 --> 1:55:15.803
You too, dude.
You'll find out when you become a parent.

1:55:19.963 --> 1:55:21.563
If she sell us out,

1:55:23.953 --> 1:55:26.443
Will Soyoung be able to start over?

1:55:28.383 --> 1:55:29.403
Of course.

1:55:30.503 --> 1:55:31.773
No matter what

1:55:33.283 --> 1:55:34.643
with Woosung.

1:55:54.433 --> 1:55:56.553
If you go first,
I’ll catch up with you in a minute.

1:56:00.263 --> 1:56:02.223
Hey, come here.

1:56:02.503 --> 1:56:04.223
- Hey, Taeho.
- Why don't you come?

1:56:04.223 --> 1:56:05.503
- I need to talk to you.
- Come here.

1:56:05.503 --> 1:56:06.793
- Wait.
- Let go.

1:56:06.793 --> 1:56:08.893
You haven't given up yet?
Hey, wait.

1:56:09.103 --> 1:56:10.873
Of course, so don't ask.

1:56:12.383 --> 1:56:14.573
Hey, think about it too.

1:56:14.853 --> 1:56:18.463
If that woman raises the kid,
I don't think he's going to grow.

1:56:18.463 --> 1:56:20.743
Would you be happy? Huh?

1:56:20.983 --> 1:56:23.143
Why are you pretending to be
nice? That's a bullshit.

1:56:23.383 --> 1:56:25.993
You're just a broker.
Seriously, come on, won't you let me go?

1:56:26.903 --> 1:56:29.353
- Oh, really.
- I need to talk to you.

1:56:29.743 --> 1:56:31.043
Hey, don't do that.

1:56:34.263 --> 1:56:37.263
With that 40 million won,
Let's do business together.

1:56:40.343 --> 1:56:43.413
You're talking nonsense.
Why should I do it with you?

1:56:46.503 --> 1:56:48.383
I don't work with Dongsu, anymore.

1:56:52.463 --> 1:56:53.483
What?

1:56:55.183 --> 1:56:57.073
I don't know what to do with them.

1:57:00.253 --> 1:57:02.913
I don't need them anymore...

1:57:10.063 --> 1:57:13.253
She scolded me a lot
for saying that yesterday.

1:57:14.083 --> 1:57:16.263
You suddenly brought that up.

1:57:16.963 --> 1:57:18.573
We're being rude to her mother.

1:57:19.453 --> 1:57:21.273
So, oh...

1:57:21.383 --> 1:57:24.093
If you want to meet him,
call me anytime.

1:57:24.093 --> 1:57:26.093
Please tell her mother, please.

1:57:27.663 --> 1:57:31.273
I don't want to hide anything from him.

1:57:34.043 --> 1:57:36.023
If you're someone like that,

1:57:37.853 --> 1:57:39.413
Even if I send Woosung away,

1:57:41.233 --> 1:57:43.493
I think it would have been okay.

1:57:47.853 --> 1:57:49.703
Oh? Who is it?

1:57:50.753 --> 1:57:52.123
It must be Sang-hyun.

1:57:55.003 --> 1:57:57.423
Yes, who are you?

1:57:59.443 --> 1:58:00.753
This is the police.

1:58:01.763 --> 1:58:03.343
No, this, what is the meaning this?

1:58:03.343 --> 1:58:06.093
On suspicion of illegal child trafficking,
I need you to go to the station with me.

1:58:06.293 --> 1:58:06.973
Honey.

1:58:06.973 --> 1:58:08.853
You stay in there for a second.

1:58:08.853 --> 1:58:10.773
I, wait a minute, I go out...

1:58:11.973 --> 1:58:15.353
Mr. Kim Dongsu?
You're under arrest for human trafficking charges.

1:58:16.223 --> 1:58:17.313
Dongsu-hyung!

1:58:24.903 --> 1:58:26.193
Where is Soyoung?
