SO HOW'D THE SUMMER
JOB HUNT GO?

00:04.500 --> 00:07.133
I TELL YOU.
IT'S TOUGH TO
SECURE EMPLOYMENT

00:07.133 --> 00:08.467
IN AN ECONOMIC
CLIMATE WHERE
INTEREST RATES

00:08.467 --> 00:10.367

AND LARGE CAP STOCKS

00:10.367 --> 00:14.200

DOES LIKE HIS EMPLOYEES
TO SEE OVER THE COUNTER.

00:23.033 --> 00:24.800

IS EARN A FEW BUCKS

00:24.800 --> 00:26.500
SO WE CAN GET
INTO THIS NEW TEEN CLUB,

00:26.500 --> 00:28.200
BUT WHENEVER WE ASK MOM
FOR SOME MONEY,

00:28.200 --> 00:31.200
SHE JUST
GIVES US COUPONS.

00:31.200 --> 00:33.233
AND IT'S HARD TO BRIBE
YOUR WAY PAST A BOUNCER

00:33.233 --> 00:36.734
WITH 12 CENTS OFF
TOASTER STRUDEL.

00:36.734 --> 00:38.867
THE ONLY WAY WE'RE
GOING TO GET INTO A CLUB

00:38.867 --> 00:41.667
IS IF WE
OPEN ONE OURSELVES.

00:41.667 --> 00:43.400
THAT'S NOT
A BAD IDEA.

00:43.400 --> 00:45.367

ON MONDAY NIGHTS.

YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY SAVINGS!

20:55.200 --> 20:59.033
WELL, I WAS THINKING
THAT WE MIGHT DIP
INTO YOUR SAVINGS.

20:59.033 --> 21:03.400
YOU ARE NOT
TOUCHING PIGGY.

21:03.400 --> 21:06.000
IT'S A CAN'T-MISS
OPPORTUNITY.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.400
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT IS IT?

21:07.400 --> 21:10.300
GLOW-IN-THE-DARK PIZZA.

21:10.300 --> 21:11.600
WHAT MAKES IT GLOW?

21:11.600 --> 21:13.367
DON'T ASK.

21:17.934 --> 21:19.200
MADDIE, MADDIE!

21:19.200 --> 21:20.500
MADDIE?

21:20.500 --> 21:21.767
WHERE ARE YOU?

21:21.767 --> 21:25.200
I HAVE MORE SIMPLY LONDON
COSMETICS PRODUCTS FOR YOU!

21:29.400 --> 21:34.734
REALLY? AND WHAT MAKES
YOU THINK I WANT
TO USE THEM?

21:34.734 --> 21:36.867
DID MY PRODUCTS
DO THAT TO YOU?

21:36.867 --> 21:40.300
NO, NO. I DECIDED
TO GO TO CLOWN COLLEGE.

21:40.300 --> 21:42.500
WELL, THEN YOU
LOOK PERFECT.

21:42.500 --> 21:44.500
OF COURSE
YOUR PRODUCTS DID THIS!

21:44.500 --> 21:47.100
OH, MY.

21:47.100 --> 21:49.600
OH. WHAT'S
THAT SMELL?

21:49.600 --> 21:52.133
MOST PEOPLE ARE GUESSING
DEAD FERRET.

21:53.600 --> 21:56.400
APPARENTLY, YOUR PERFUME
CHANGES THE LONGER
YOU WEAR IT.

21:56.400 --> 21:57.900
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

21:57.900 --> 21:59.867
YOU THINK?

21:59.867 --> 22:01.100
DID YOU TEST
THE STUFF?

22:01.100 --> 22:05.300
YES. ON YOU.

22:05.300 --> 22:06.400
I SHOULD TAKE
A PICTURE OF THIS

22:06.400 --> 22:07.600
FOR THE BOYS
IN DADDY'S LAB.

22:07.600 --> 22:08.867
THEY'LL PROBABLY
WANT TO KNOW
ABOUT IT.

22:08.867 --> 22:09.867
NO, NO. PLEASE DON'T.

22:09.867 --> 22:11.300
OW! I CAN'T SEE!

22:11.300 --> 22:13.100
YOU'RE LUCKY.
YOU'RE NOT
LOOKING SO GOOD.

22:13.100 --> 22:14.400
OHH!

22:14.400 --> 22:15.867
AAH!

22:20.467 --> 22:23.834
SECURITY! CLOWN DOWN
IN THE LOBBY.
