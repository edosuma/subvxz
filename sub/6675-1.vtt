03:39.385 --> 03:43.764
All ready here, sir. Crew standing by
and awaiting your word. Over.

03:59.322 --> 04:01.365
Right. Over and out.

04:12.669 --> 04:15.837
Our man was brought down
at 2 a. m. this morning.

04:16.005 --> 04:20.175
SHAEF, in their all-knowing wisdom,
didn't let us know until 10 a. m.

04:20.343 --> 04:23.303
Damned idiots.
Damned idiots for not letting us know.

04:23.471 --> 04:27.015
Double damned idiots
for ignoring our advice in the first place.

04:27.183 --> 04:29.518
Anyway, here he is...

04:30.353 --> 04:32.187
...in a town called Werfen...

04:32.355 --> 04:35.983
...at the Schloss Adler,
the Castle of the Eagles.

04:36.150 --> 04:39.820
And believe me, it's well-named,
because only an eagle can get to it.

04:40.613 --> 04:44.866
Our job is to get inside there
and get him out as soon as possible...

04:45.034 --> 04:47.286
...before they can
get the information from him.

04:47.453 --> 04:50.163
How are you so sure that he's there, sir?

04:50.331 --> 04:53.709
The Mosquito he was in
crash-landed only 10 miles away.

04:53.876 --> 04:57.879
The Schloss Adler is the headquarters of the
German secret service in southern Bavaria.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.257
Where else would they take him?

05:00.425 --> 05:04.011
- How did the plane crash, sir?
- Through the most damnable ill luck.

05:04.178 --> 05:07.347
We carried out a saturation raid
on Nuremberg last night.

05:07.515 --> 05:11.518
There shouldn't have been a German fighter
within 100 miles of the Austrian border.

05:11.686 --> 05:14.229
A wandering Messerschmitt patrol
got him.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.898
Anyway, that's not important.

05:17.191 --> 05:21.611
What is important is that
we get him out before he talks.

05:22.363 --> 05:25.699
Or I should say, you get him out.

05:25.867 --> 05:28.035
What about paratroops, sir?

05:28.202 --> 05:31.872
The Schloss Adler
is inaccessible and impregnable.

05:32.457 --> 05:35.083
It would require a battalion
of paratroops to take it.

05:35.251 --> 05:36.918
We haven't got the time.

05:37.295 --> 05:39.796
Stealth and secrecy are our only hope...

05:40.381 --> 05:43.717
...and you gentlemen are,
I trust, stealthy and secretive.

05:43.885 --> 05:47.637
We realize of course that you've never
worked together before as a team...

05:47.847 --> 05:52.142
...but you're familiar with one another,
except for Lieutenant Schaffer here.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.770
You probably noticed
that Lieutenant Schaffer...

05:54.937 --> 05:57.898
...wears the shoulder flashes
of the American Ranger division.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.442
I think that speaks for itself.

06:00.902 --> 06:02.944
Major Smith will lead the group in.

06:03.112 --> 06:06.406
Now, you're all expert
at survival behind enemy lines.

06:06.616 --> 06:08.200
Smith, Lieutenant Schaffer...

06:08.368 --> 06:11.620
...Sergeants Harrod and MacPherson
in their military capacities...

06:11.788 --> 06:14.915
...the rest of you in other duties.

06:15.083 --> 06:17.334
You all speak fluent German.

06:17.502 --> 06:20.337
You've been trained
in different types of combat.

06:20.922 --> 06:24.132
If anybody has a chance
of getting him out, you have.

06:24.342 --> 06:26.468
There is, of course, another way, sir.

06:26.636 --> 06:29.971
A way with a 100 percent guarantee
of success.

06:30.139 --> 06:34.893
Neither Admiral Rolland or I
claim to be omniscient or infallible.

06:35.061 --> 06:37.437
Is there an alternative that we've missed?

06:37.605 --> 06:41.983
Whistle up a pathfinder squadron
of Lancasters with 10-ton bombs.

06:42.819 --> 06:45.821
I don't think anybody in that castle
would ever talk again.

06:45.988 --> 06:48.824
Nor do I think that you grasp
the realities of the situation.

06:49.325 --> 06:52.494
The captured man, General Carnaby,
is an American.

06:52.829 --> 06:55.664
If we were to destroy him,
then I think General Eisenhower...

06:55.832 --> 06:59.459
...might launch his second front against us
rather than against the Germans.

06:59.627 --> 07:04.381
There are certain niceties to be observed
in our relationship with our allies.

07:06.384 --> 07:10.846
Very well, then, gentlemen.
Ten o'clock tonight at the airfield.

07:11.347 --> 07:14.349
- No more questions, I take it?
- Yes, sir.

07:14.684 --> 07:18.186
Begging the colonel's pardon, sir.
What's all this about?

07:18.354 --> 07:20.522
I mean, why is this man
so damned important?

07:20.815 --> 07:22.524
- Why should...?
- That'll do, sergeant.

07:22.692 --> 07:24.693
You have all the information you require.

07:24.861 --> 07:27.696
I think if we're sending a man
to what may be his death...

07:27.864 --> 07:30.198
...he has a right to know why.

07:30.408 --> 07:32.492
It's painfully simple, sergeant.

07:33.327 --> 07:36.204
General Carnaby is one
of the overall coordinators...

07:36.372 --> 07:38.748
...of planning for the second front.

07:39.041 --> 07:43.044
He set out last night to meet
his opposite numbers in the Middle East...

07:43.212 --> 07:46.006
...to finalize the plans
for the invasion of Europe.

07:46.382 --> 07:49.092
The rendezvous with the Russians
was to have been in Crete.

07:49.594 --> 07:52.053
Now, unfortunately, his plane
didn't get through.

07:52.722 --> 07:57.809
Now, if the Germans can make him talk...

07:57.977 --> 08:00.562
...it could mean no second front
this year.

08:00.730 --> 08:04.900
- Do you understand, sergeant?
- Yes, sir.

08:05.485 --> 08:08.778
- I'm sorry, sir.
That's all right, sergeant. Forget it.

08:08.946 --> 08:12.032
Now, if you have any more questions,
Major Smith will answer them.

08:12.533 --> 08:14.284
That's all, gentlemen.

08:44.023 --> 08:46.525
Get them ready.
We're approaching the drop area.

08:46.692 --> 08:48.527
Stand by!

09:06.128 --> 09:08.004
Green on! Go!

11:38.656 --> 11:40.198
Where's Harrod?

11:44.078 --> 11:48.998
Well, last time I saw him, he was drifting
towards those trees over here.

11:53.587 --> 11:56.673
All right. Spread out.

11:56.841 --> 11:58.007
Let's go and find him.

12:27.329 --> 12:29.164
Major!

13:14.543 --> 13:17.670
- His neck's broken.
- Damn it.

13:21.842 --> 13:25.220
Well, what do we do now?
Do we bury him or do we leave him here?

13:25.387 --> 13:28.890
We leave him here. The snow
will cover him in a couple of hours.

13:29.058 --> 13:33.186
Get back and pick up the equipment.
I want to see if the radio's still working.

15:14.663 --> 15:16.164
Well...

15:16.498 --> 15:19.918
...the radio works all right. There's a barn
about a mile down the valley.

15:20.085 --> 15:22.045
We'll use it to check our equipment.

15:22.212 --> 15:24.839
- What about the people who live in it?
- There aren't any.

15:25.007 --> 15:27.300
This is a high alpine pasture.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.678
They bring the cattle up in May
and take them down in September.

15:31.013 --> 15:33.806
The rest of the time,
the place is totally deserted.

15:33.974 --> 15:36.434
Come on. Let's go.

16:10.761 --> 16:13.721
Somehow, you know, this just isn't me.

16:13.889 --> 16:17.642
It's not any of us, Jock.
You're the cook. Cook...

16:17.810 --> 16:22.897
...some hot food and some hot coffee,
and then call London on the radio.

16:23.065 --> 16:25.692
Damn it. I left that codebook
in Sergeant Harrod's tunic.

16:25.859 --> 16:29.696
- I'll go and get it for you.
- No, it's all right. It's my own stupid fault.

16:29.863 --> 16:33.574
Sounds as if it's still blowing a blizzard.
Yeah.

16:34.076 --> 16:36.327
Well, if I'm not back in an hour...

16:36.495 --> 16:39.414
...signal me with a flare pistol
four times every five minutes.

16:39.581 --> 16:41.249
That should bring a blind man home.

16:41.417 --> 16:43.835
Might also bring the best part
of a German regiment.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.546
There's not a German within five miles.

16:46.714 --> 16:49.132
Nobody leaves here until I come back.

16:49.299 --> 16:52.468
- Jock, save me some coffee.
- It'll be cold by then.

16:53.137 --> 16:56.431
They say that's an advantage.
You can't taste cold coffee.

18:17.346 --> 18:18.638
Halt.

18:19.515 --> 18:21.390
Turn around.

18:29.399 --> 18:32.318
You took your time getting here,
didn't you?

18:32.778 --> 18:34.821
Things to attend to.

18:35.739 --> 18:37.365
- You enjoy your trip?
- Lovely.

18:37.533 --> 18:39.659
I nearly froze to death
in that damn plane.

18:39.827 --> 18:44.413
Why couldn't you have supplied some hot
water bottles or an electrically heated suit?

18:44.581 --> 18:48.501
- I thought you loved me.
- I can't help what you think.

18:48.669 --> 18:50.795
You managed to bring your gear.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.964
Is that all the greeting I'm going to get?

18:53.132 --> 18:57.426
I'm afraid so, for the time being.
My radio operator was killed in the drop.

18:57.594 --> 18:59.345
What happened?

18:59.555 --> 19:01.639
Something struck him
in the back of the neck.

19:01.807 --> 19:04.016
Either the haft of a knife
or the butt of a gun.

19:04.184 --> 19:06.185
The skin was unbroken,
but badly discolored.

19:06.353 --> 19:08.437
It means someone
broke his neck afterwards...

19:08.605 --> 19:10.398
...to make it look like an accident.

19:10.566 --> 19:14.402
Now listen, I'm taking the group at dawn
over the ridge into the next valley.

19:14.570 --> 19:17.613
We'll stop in the woods until about 7.
Now, don't stumble into us.

19:18.574 --> 19:21.367
As soon as it's dark,
we'll move into the village of Werfen.

19:21.535 --> 19:24.412
In the village, there's a gasthaus
called Zum Wilden Hirsch.

19:24.872 --> 19:27.373
Behind it and to the right,
there's a woodshed.

19:27.541 --> 19:31.127
I'll meet you there
at exactly 8:00 tomorrow night.

19:32.421 --> 19:35.339
- And after that, what?
- I'll let you know when the time comes.

19:35.507 --> 19:36.883
Ah.

19:37.301 --> 19:40.261
- I see you've come fully prepared.
- Never mind about that.

19:40.429 --> 19:44.974
How do you know about all these things,
Zum Wilden Hirsch and the shed?

19:46.602 --> 19:47.935
I'm entitled to know.

19:48.770 --> 19:50.730
You're entitled to know nothing.

19:53.150 --> 19:55.818
We've worked together for three years.
I'm a professional.

19:55.986 --> 19:57.028
So am I.

19:57.446 --> 20:00.281
If I were the marrying kind, which I'm...

20:06.872 --> 20:10.625
- I thought you were in a hurry.
- So I am.

20:10.792 --> 20:12.501
Aren't you?

21:19.903 --> 21:21.779
What kept you?

21:22.072 --> 21:24.824
Well, I was very lucky.

21:24.992 --> 21:29.620
I ran into this fabulous blond.
She was lying on a snowdrift.

21:29.788 --> 21:31.205
Does she have a friend?

21:31.373 --> 21:33.791
No, I'm afraid you're out of luck.

21:34.710 --> 21:38.838
- Thanks for waiting up for me, anyway.
- No problem.

21:51.893 --> 21:53.894
Lieutenant, why don't you go to sleep?

21:54.062 --> 21:56.439
It'll be dawn in a couple of hours.
You too, Jock.

21:56.606 --> 21:58.149
Yeah, I'll do that.

22:06.950 --> 22:08.909
Can't get a thing.

22:11.246 --> 22:12.455
Probably the storm, huh?

22:13.957 --> 22:15.166
Yeah.

22:15.334 --> 22:17.752
Yeah, we'll try again in the morning.

22:54.748 --> 22:58.459
Lieutenant, come with me.
The rest of you stay here.

23:14.476 --> 23:16.685
Better leave the equipment here.

23:45.632 --> 23:48.008
Somebody's got to be crazy.

23:48.844 --> 23:51.178
How'd your colonel
expect anyone to get in there?

23:51.346 --> 23:53.848
He feels if he can penetrate
the German High Command...

23:54.015 --> 23:56.058
...we shouldn't have difficulty
getting up.

23:56.226 --> 23:57.977
He did what?

23:58.353 --> 24:01.480
He spent the years '40 to '43
in Germany, first in the Wehrmacht...

24:01.648 --> 24:04.525
...and then finally
in General Headquarters in Berlin.

24:04.693 --> 24:07.027
They say he knew Hitler quite well.

24:07.195 --> 24:09.864
- I thought he looked a little nuts.
- Yeah, probably is.

24:10.031 --> 24:13.075
Now we've got problems of our own.
Get the boys into the trees.

24:13.243 --> 24:16.579
We've brought them too far over.
Be sure they go beyond that tree line.

24:16.746 --> 24:19.039
- And what about you?
- I'll be along in a minute.

24:19.207 --> 24:22.418
- Be sure they stay behind the trees.
- All right.

25:24.064 --> 25:28.526
Broadsword calling Danny Boy.
Broadsword calling Danny Boy. Over.

25:29.611 --> 25:32.738
Danny Boy calling
Broadsword. Father Machree is waiting.

25:33.532 --> 25:35.783
This is Father Machree, Broadsword.

25:35.951 --> 25:38.536
What is your present position, please?
Over.

25:39.371 --> 25:43.958
Woods due west of castle.
Descending at dusk. Harrod dead.

25:44.251 --> 25:45.876
Over.

25:46.670 --> 25:50.798
Was Harrod killed accidentally? Over.

25:50.966 --> 25:53.008
No. Over.

25:53.176 --> 25:55.094
By the Germans? Over.

25:55.512 --> 25:56.971
No.

25:57.138 --> 26:00.599
Time of next broadcast uncertain.
Will you stand by?

26:01.059 --> 26:02.643
Over.

26:02.811 --> 26:06.647
Colonel Turner and I will remain
at headquarters till operation completed.

26:06.815 --> 26:09.316
Good luck. Out.

26:19.703 --> 26:21.870
It looks as though you're right, sir.

26:22.872 --> 26:25.332
Yes, I'm afraid so.

26:25.500 --> 26:27.543
Who's next, I wonder?

26:27.711 --> 26:29.003
Smith himself, perhaps.

26:29.963 --> 26:34.675
I doubt that.
Some people have a sixth sense.

26:34.843 --> 26:37.469
He has a sixth, a seventh and an eighth.

26:37.679 --> 26:41.223
- He's our best agent.
- Except yourself.

26:42.851 --> 26:47.563
Still and all, even if he is the best,
this whole operation looks impossible now.

27:28.855 --> 27:31.857
Take a look down there,
at the foot of the castle.

27:34.653 --> 27:36.236
Dobermans.

27:36.404 --> 27:40.658
Yeah. Dobermans, a guard tower
and a wire fence.

27:40.825 --> 27:43.786
Fences can be cut or climbed, lieutenant.

27:43.953 --> 27:48.874
I doubt if that one can be climbed. It's got
around 3,000 volts running through it.

27:49.042 --> 27:52.086
If I'm not mistaken, major,
that's an army barracks over there.

27:54.839 --> 27:58.258
No mistake. This is the headquarters
of the Wehrmacht Alpenkorps.

27:58.802 --> 28:02.262
Swell. If you got any other surprises,
I think I ought to know about them.

28:02.430 --> 28:04.139
I thought you knew, lieutenant.

28:04.307 --> 28:06.767
Why do you think
we're not dressed as German sailors?

28:06.935 --> 28:08.936
Training troops come and go all the time.

28:09.104 --> 28:11.605
What are six new faces
among 600 new faces?

28:11.773 --> 28:14.942
Look, major,
this is primarily a British operation.

28:15.110 --> 28:17.945
I'm an American.
I don't even know why the hell I'm here.

28:18.113 --> 28:20.572
Lieutenant, you're here
because you're an American.

29:43.948 --> 29:46.950
Dear Kramer, you have turned
a little gray since I saw you last.

29:47.118 --> 29:49.077
I'm afraid so, sir.

29:49.496 --> 29:51.705
- How is Berlin, sir?
- Things have changed.

29:51.873 --> 29:53.207
You like my machine?

29:53.374 --> 29:56.126
- It looks pretty dangerous.
- Well, you must try it.

29:56.294 --> 29:58.921
Major Burkhalter, my adjutant.

29:59.088 --> 30:02.257
Major Brant, Jaeger Battalion.

30:02.425 --> 30:06.011
Colonel Weissner, Field Security.

30:06.387 --> 30:09.431
Major Von Hapen, Gestapo.

30:16.397 --> 30:20.275
- Have you questioned him yet?
- No. I was waiting for you.

30:20.443 --> 30:23.862
That Major Von Hapen,
does he know General Carnaby's here?

30:24.030 --> 30:27.908
Yes. I did inform him of his arrival,
but not of his importance.

30:28.076 --> 30:31.578
Good. If possible, I'd prefer the Gestapo
to be kept out of this matter...

30:31.746 --> 30:34.122
...until we have the information we want.
- Fine.

30:34.290 --> 30:37.167
We don't need them cluttering up things
with torture chambers.

30:37.335 --> 30:40.087
This can remain a strictly army matter
for the time being.

30:40.255 --> 30:41.755
- I agree.
- Good.

30:41.923 --> 30:45.759
I've had a very tiring trip down here
from Berlin. I'd like to freshen up a bit.

30:45.927 --> 30:48.595
Perhaps sleep a few hours
before meeting General Carnaby.

30:48.763 --> 30:51.098
I'll see you to your quarters.
Thank you.

30:51.266 --> 30:53.767
The meeting will be ready
whenever you wish.

30:53.935 --> 30:55.477
Tell me...

34:18.139 --> 34:20.098
Show me your papers.

34:27.857 --> 34:28.899
Right.

34:29.067 --> 34:32.277
I've written her many times
of course, but...

34:32.445 --> 34:36.989
...with so many troops on leave in Berlin,
it was hardly likely she'd remember me.

34:37.199 --> 34:39.868
But one always hopes
you're the one she'll never forget.

34:40.036 --> 34:42.120
Yeah. What was her name, anyway?

34:42.288 --> 34:44.289
- Fred.
- Fred?

34:44.456 --> 34:48.835
Oh, yeah, I remember Fred, yeah.
She was a short little redhead.

35:23.788 --> 35:26.164
We'll try this one behind us.

35:26.332 --> 35:28.291
When you get inside, circulate around.

35:28.459 --> 35:31.378
Keep your ears open for anything
about General Carnaby.

35:32.380 --> 35:36.174
We meet back here
in half an hour. All right.

36:23.347 --> 36:24.931
Two beers.

36:33.941 --> 36:35.275
Ah.

36:43.784 --> 36:45.785
See you later.

37:00.885 --> 37:02.802
Anything else needed here? Oh.

37:02.970 --> 37:05.847
And who might you be,
my pretty alpine rose?

37:06.015 --> 37:09.434
- Heidi. Stop, major. I've got work.
- There's no more important work...

37:09.602 --> 37:11.978
...than entertaining
the soldiers of the fatherland.

37:12.146 --> 37:14.814
- Shall I sing you a song?
- I hear too much singing.

37:14.982 --> 37:18.151
Oh, very well, then. I'll whistle.
It goes like this:

37:23.199 --> 37:26.201
I bet you have
a beautiful singing voice too.

37:26.369 --> 37:27.994
Thank you.

37:28.162 --> 37:31.164
Be in the woodshed in five minutes.

37:31.832 --> 37:33.708
Now slap me across the face
as hard as you can.

37:34.043 --> 37:35.669
Oh!

37:39.340 --> 37:41.007
Major...

37:41.425 --> 37:44.427
...your conduct does not become
an officer of the Wehrmacht.

37:45.680 --> 37:48.348
Herr Major, when you talk to me.

37:48.516 --> 37:52.018
Major Bernd Himmler.
Does the name mean anything to you?

37:53.729 --> 37:56.940
I advise you to mind
your own business in future.

37:57.358 --> 37:59.442
Is that understood?

38:13.416 --> 38:16.543
- Cognac.
- Make that two.

38:16.711 --> 38:20.046
I don't suppose you found out anything
about General Carnaby.

38:20.256 --> 38:22.257
I didn't get around to that. Thank you.

38:22.425 --> 38:25.051
What were you and that major
talking about?

38:25.344 --> 38:28.013
I told him I was Himmler's brother.

38:29.307 --> 38:31.891
Yeah, I could see why that would
shake him up a little.

38:32.059 --> 38:34.060
More than a little, I should think.

38:34.228 --> 38:36.521
Keep an eye on things. I'll be back.

39:42.838 --> 39:44.130
Take your clothes off.

39:44.298 --> 39:48.176
- But I...
- Don't argue. Take your clothes off.

39:50.721 --> 39:52.430
All right.

39:54.850 --> 39:58.812
Now, relax. I didn't mean it that way.

40:00.272 --> 40:04.776
You are going up to the castle tonight as...
Well, yes, as a domestic.

40:05.653 --> 40:07.570
How? Naked?

40:07.738 --> 40:09.823
Not a bad idea, but it's a bit obvious.

40:09.990 --> 40:15.078
There's an acute staff shortage in Germany
and the Schloss Adler is no exception.

40:16.580 --> 40:19.999
You're the type they're looking for:
young, intelligent, good-looking...

40:20.167 --> 40:22.502
...and as we both know,
not entirely without humor.

40:22.670 --> 40:23.962
You must be mad.

40:24.130 --> 40:26.673
If I wasn't, what would I be doing
in this job?

40:26.841 --> 40:28.508
Now listen very carefully.

40:28.676 --> 40:32.178
You're supposed to arrive on a bus
from Steingaden in about 20 minutes.

40:32.346 --> 40:35.390
Your name is Maria Schenk.
You come from the Rhineland.

40:35.599 --> 40:37.350
Here, give me that boot.

40:37.810 --> 40:40.186
You've had TB and were forced
to give up your job.

40:40.354 --> 40:43.231
You have a cousin called Heidi
who works in Zum Wilden Hirsch.

40:43.399 --> 40:45.358
It's because of her that you got the job.

40:45.526 --> 40:48.403
- Where are my identity papers?
- In that case...

40:48.571 --> 40:51.906
...together with your travel permit.
Heidi will give you the rest later.

40:52.074 --> 40:54.534
It must have taken time
to prepare these things.

40:54.702 --> 40:57.954
Very likely. Our Forgery Department
did a special job on your papers.

40:59.457 --> 41:04.043
But I thought General Carnaby's
plane crashed only yesterday morning.

41:04.211 --> 41:05.962
It was carefully arranged.

41:06.172 --> 41:09.132
The plane was crash-landed
in Oberhausen Military Airfield...

41:09.300 --> 41:10.842
...about five miles from here.

41:11.010 --> 41:14.429
It was riddled with machine-gun holes,
British machine-gun holes.

41:14.597 --> 41:18.057
But what the hell?
A hole is a hole is a hole, as they say.

41:18.225 --> 41:21.811
Are you trying to say that you'd risk
the life of an American general...

41:21.979 --> 41:24.898
...and all the plans for the second front?
- Of course not.

41:26.525 --> 41:28.485
Give me the other boot.

41:28.986 --> 41:30.904
I'm in a hurry to get to the castle...

41:31.071 --> 41:34.032
...before they find out
they haven't got General Carnaby.

41:34.200 --> 41:36.951
The chap they've got knows no more
about the second front...

41:37.119 --> 41:41.414
...than I know about the back end of
the moon. He's an American corporal.

41:41.582 --> 41:43.124
His name is Cartwright Jones.

41:43.292 --> 41:45.585
He's an ex-actor, probably second-rate...

41:45.753 --> 41:48.087
...but he's the dead spitting image
of the general.

41:48.255 --> 41:51.299
Did you talk this poor man
into getting involved with all this?

41:51.467 --> 41:54.969
I didn't have to. He volunteered.
What actor wouldn't?

41:56.013 --> 42:00.183
If he pulls this off, it'll be
the summit of his professional career.

42:00.559 --> 42:02.894
Mind you,
it might be a short engagement.

42:03.187 --> 42:05.313
Yes. A one-night stand.

42:22.122 --> 42:23.456
Ah.

42:23.666 --> 42:24.874
Well, here we are.

42:25.042 --> 42:27.043
Mary, now Maria,
this is your cousin Heidi.

42:27.211 --> 42:31.214
Leave this behind in case you're searched.
Heidi will tell you what to do from now on.

42:31.465 --> 42:36.302
She's been one of our top agents
in Bavaria since 1941 and...

42:36.804 --> 42:38.972
What a disguise.

43:26.562 --> 43:28.479
So he left three minutes after me...

43:28.647 --> 43:32.817
...in a hurry, you say,
so he wasn't after me.

43:33.235 --> 43:34.861
Any of the others leave?

43:35.195 --> 43:37.655
Not that I could see,
but this place is so crowded...

43:37.823 --> 43:40.074
...and there are several other exits.

43:40.242 --> 43:42.744
Any one of them could have slipped out.

43:44.204 --> 43:47.832
You better start playing it straight
or you can deal me out of this mess.

43:48.542 --> 43:52.086
Now, we both know that radio operator
wasn't killed in any drop.

43:52.838 --> 43:56.257
Now, with MacPherson dead,
there's only five of us left.

43:56.634 --> 44:00.303
You either let me know what's going on
or there's only gonna be four.

44:00.471 --> 44:01.929
All right, lieutenant.

44:02.097 --> 44:06.392
This morning you asked me why you,
an American, was on this mission.

44:06.685 --> 44:09.937
Well, the answer is really very simple.

44:15.611 --> 44:17.362
Maria.

44:17.655 --> 44:20.573
Oh, my dear Maria, you came after all.

44:20.741 --> 44:24.160
My dear cousin Heidi, how wonderful
to see you after all these years.

44:24.328 --> 44:27.830
Gestapo. I am so happy to see you.

44:27.998 --> 44:31.584
May I introduce you to a friend of mine?
Major Von Hapen.

44:31.752 --> 44:34.337
My cousin Maria Schenk.

44:35.506 --> 44:39.676
Your cousin told us to expect you,
Fräulein Schenk, but Heidi...

44:39.843 --> 44:42.345
...you did not tell me
she was as beautiful as this.

44:42.513 --> 44:44.180
Thank you.

44:44.431 --> 44:47.725
Perhaps when you're ready
to take the cable car to the castle...

44:47.893 --> 44:50.144
...I'll have the honor to escort you.
Thank you.

44:50.312 --> 44:52.480
And I am going with her.

44:52.815 --> 44:53.898
Oh.

44:54.066 --> 44:56.901
Both of you, huh?
Well, then I am very fortunate.

44:58.487 --> 45:00.947
Fräulein, until a little bit later.

45:25.639 --> 45:28.224
This is a map of the castle.

45:29.309 --> 45:31.144
And your instructions.

45:31.311 --> 45:32.645
Do your homework well.

45:49.705 --> 45:51.539
He doesn't seem to be anywhere in here.

45:51.707 --> 45:55.209
Wonder where the devil he's got to.
I gave orders that nobody should leave.

45:55.377 --> 45:57.170
Shall I go outside and take a look?

46:05.387 --> 46:07.096
Attention. Nobody make a move.

46:07.264 --> 46:10.558
Against the wall, please.
Against the wall.

46:15.189 --> 46:16.773
Attention.

46:16.940 --> 46:20.359
We are looking for four or five
Alpenkorps deserters from Stuttgart.

46:20.527 --> 46:23.362
To escape, they killed two officers
and a guardroom sergeant.

46:23.530 --> 46:25.698
They were last known
to be heading this way.

46:25.866 --> 46:27.950
Clever. Very clever, indeed.

46:28.118 --> 46:33.080
I want the senior officers of Drafts 13,
14 and 15 to come forward at once.

46:35.042 --> 46:36.292
Check their papers.

46:37.878 --> 46:41.047
Well, gentlemen, any suggestions?

46:45.636 --> 46:47.303
Lieutenant?

46:47.930 --> 46:52.475
Well, I think we'll stand a lot better chance
outside than we will in here.

46:52.893 --> 46:54.644
Agreed.

46:55.270 --> 46:57.897
Gentlemen, see you after the war.

47:05.697 --> 47:09.158
These papers are from the Fourth Panzer
Division stationed in Stuttgart.

47:09.326 --> 47:11.035
When were they issued to him?

47:11.203 --> 47:13.579
- Colonel.
- What is it, major?

47:13.747 --> 47:17.750
Myself and the others are the ones you're
looking for. We've come to surrender.

47:18.293 --> 47:20.920
Lieutenant, take the three men away
for questioning.

47:21.088 --> 47:23.339
The officers will come with me.

47:34.101 --> 47:35.935
Excuse me.

48:05.966 --> 48:08.175
- Yes?
- Major Von Hapen.

48:09.803 --> 48:11.470
Yes, sir.

48:22.107 --> 48:23.774
Fräulein.

49:16.203 --> 49:18.663
It's just my shoelaces.

50:36.992 --> 50:39.618
- Need to get rid of this thing.
- Yeah.

50:39.786 --> 50:42.288
Over the cliff. Let's push.

51:02.434 --> 51:05.227
Okay. Push.

51:10.275 --> 51:11.984
Push.

51:14.404 --> 51:15.446
And a little more.

51:40.180 --> 51:41.972
Good evening, lieutenant.

51:42.140 --> 51:44.642
This is Miss Schenk. Lieutenant Kernitser.

51:44.810 --> 51:48.312
She is the colonel's secretary
in charge of all the female staff.

51:48.480 --> 51:52.399
Can I see your papers, please?
And yours, Fräulein.

52:02.077 --> 52:04.161
Would you come with me, please?

52:04.329 --> 52:08.207
- Perhaps I'll see you a little later.
- Thank you.

52:29.020 --> 52:32.064
Do you find anything interesting, major?

52:35.735 --> 52:39.405
I hear there was some excitement
in the village tonight.

52:39.573 --> 52:41.240
Oh, nothing very serious.

52:41.408 --> 52:44.243
Just the arrest of five army deserters,
that's all.

52:44.452 --> 52:47.580
Not quite. Those were the orders
that were put out.

52:47.747 --> 52:52.251
But actually, they were five British agents
dressed in German uniforms.

52:52.419 --> 52:55.421
British agents? Why wasn't I informed?

52:55.839 --> 52:57.756
I'm informing you now, major.

52:58.842 --> 53:00.593
If you sent out the orders, colonel...

53:01.511 --> 53:04.555
...then you must have known
for some time...

53:04.723 --> 53:08.058
...who they were
and that they were in this district.

53:08.226 --> 53:11.312
We called you in your office
and in your rooms.

53:11.479 --> 53:13.105
You were not there.

53:13.273 --> 53:17.109
Colonel, I don't have to
remind you, do I...

53:17.277 --> 53:20.446
...that I am in charge of all
the Gestapo activities in this area...

53:20.614 --> 53:24.116
...and if there are foreign agents,
then I am to be informed at once!

53:24.284 --> 53:27.745
- You were not here, major.
- Then you find me, colonel.

53:27.913 --> 53:31.498
My duty is to inform you, but not
to search every gasthaus to locate you.

53:31.666 --> 53:34.168
I know your duties...

53:34.920 --> 53:36.712
...and your loyalties.

53:37.505 --> 53:40.633
Let me remind you, major,
that I'm a colonel in the SS...

53:40.800 --> 53:43.677
...and not some lieutenant
you can frighten with your threats!

53:43.845 --> 53:48.641
Your military rank and position
are obvious to me, colonel...

53:49.309 --> 53:53.062
...and so are your attempts to discredit me
with my superiors in Berlin.

53:53.230 --> 53:57.441
If there is any discredit,
you bring it upon yourself.

53:57.609 --> 53:59.360
Good night.

54:03.114 --> 54:05.616
- You better lock the door.
- Sure.

54:12.332 --> 54:14.833
Here are all the things you'll need.

54:17.170 --> 54:21.548
Automatic, field glasses,
ball of string and lead weight.

54:21.716 --> 54:23.801
- You put those things in there?
- A week ago.

54:23.969 --> 54:28.472
- You knew all about this even then?
- Yeah. Good luck, cousin.

54:38.066 --> 54:40.025
We may need these.

54:40.277 --> 54:44.863
I guess it's occurred to you, the Germans
probably know about all this stuff by now.

54:45.115 --> 54:47.116
It did cross my mind.

54:53.540 --> 54:55.874
Broadsword calling Danny Boy.

54:56.042 --> 54:59.712
Broadsword calling Danny Boy. Over.

55:02.299 --> 55:03.632
Broadsword calling Danny Boy.

55:03.800 --> 55:06.427
Broadsword calling Danny Boy. Over.

55:07.512 --> 55:09.430
Broadsword, sir.

55:10.307 --> 55:13.517
Danny Boy calling Broadsword.
Come in, Broadsword. Over.

55:14.311 --> 55:17.730
MacPherson murdered. Thomas,
Christiansen and Berkeley captured.

55:17.897 --> 55:19.898
I'm effecting entrance within the hour.

55:20.066 --> 55:22.901
Please have transport standing by. Over.

55:23.069 --> 55:25.946
Pull out now, Broadsword.
Save yourselves. Over.

55:26.698 --> 55:28.741
You must be joking. Over and out.

55:28.908 --> 55:31.076
That is an order, Broadsword. Over.

55:32.746 --> 55:34.913
Broadsword? Broadsword?

55:36.166 --> 55:41.086
Broadsword?

55:41.254 --> 55:42.921
He's gone, sir.

55:44.049 --> 55:45.841
Damn it!

55:46.009 --> 55:48.093
It's all my fault.

55:48.261 --> 55:50.763
It's all our fault, colonel.

55:50.930 --> 55:53.015
It was my idea.

55:54.100 --> 55:56.310
Maybe I'm getting too old.

55:56.478 --> 55:58.771
Maybe we're both too old.

55:59.898 --> 56:02.691
Well, anyway, there can't be
any doubt anymore.

56:02.859 --> 56:06.653
The Germans have totally penetrated Ml6.

56:07.197 --> 56:09.740
They know every move we make
almost before we make it.

56:09.908 --> 56:12.117
Where the hell are they
getting it all from?

56:12.285 --> 56:14.495
We handpicked every man
for this mission.

56:14.662 --> 56:17.790
- We have top security.
- Security?

56:18.792 --> 56:20.626
That word has become a bloody joke.

56:46.277 --> 56:48.153
We've got company.

57:00.583 --> 57:03.836
- Open the window.
- All right.

01:03:05.698 --> 01:03:10.494
Put the bag in the bus
and see if you can start the engine.

01:03:49.033 --> 01:03:50.909
- How's it going?
- Try to give it a start.

01:03:51.077 --> 01:03:52.619
Right.

01:05:24.253 --> 01:05:26.671
Yes. Captain Mueller,
with three prisoners.

01:05:27.173 --> 01:05:28.798
All right.

01:12:21.628 --> 01:12:25.048
Leave this one behind and
tie that one to the end of the rope.

01:13:29.488 --> 01:13:31.531
Good God, that nearly killed me.

01:13:31.698 --> 01:13:34.158
You shouldn't go
on these insane missions.

01:13:34.326 --> 01:13:35.827
You're getting too old.

01:13:35.994 --> 01:13:39.622
I thank you for those few kind words.

01:13:40.707 --> 01:13:45.169
The first time I've been hot
since I was in this bloody country.

01:13:46.130 --> 01:13:48.339
- You got a plan of the castle?
- Yes.

01:13:48.507 --> 01:13:50.091
Well, fetch it for me, would you?

01:14:12.156 --> 01:14:14.699
Why don't you give him a hand?

01:14:15.117 --> 01:14:18.494
What for? He's perfectly capable
of looking after himself.

01:14:18.829 --> 01:14:20.913
If I could climb up on my own,
why can't he?

01:14:27.212 --> 01:14:29.672
First left down the stairs, third door.

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:32.091
Next right-hander takes us
into the east wing.

01:14:32.384 --> 01:14:35.386
Down again. Second left.

01:14:35.554 --> 01:14:37.138
Telephone exchange.

01:14:43.645 --> 01:14:47.648
You wouldn't mind giving me a hand,
would you?

01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:58.743
You seem to have a lot of women
stashed around this country, major.

01:14:58.911 --> 01:15:01.120
I'm sorry. This is Mary.
She's one of our group.

01:15:01.288 --> 01:15:03.372
- Lieutenant Schaffer.
- Hello.

01:15:04.958 --> 01:15:06.959
Hello, Mary.

01:15:43.497 --> 01:15:45.081
Thank you.

01:15:45.249 --> 01:15:47.625
Take the rope and the explosives
to your room...

01:15:47.793 --> 01:15:49.919
...and bring them with you
when you come.

01:16:29.835 --> 01:16:33.713
- How's it looking?
- It's quiet enough.

01:16:34.756 --> 01:16:37.091
First thing we gotta do
is cripple that helicopter.

01:16:37.259 --> 01:16:39.427
They might try to fly Carnaby out in it.

01:16:39.595 --> 01:16:41.804
I think we can handle that.

01:17:12.085 --> 01:17:13.669
Hello?

01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:40.738
- You the pilot?
Yes, sir.

01:17:40.906 --> 01:17:43.032
Kommandant wants you on the phone.

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:46.577
It's in the radio office on the left,
around the corner.

01:17:47.329 --> 01:17:51.082
- Do you have a cigarette, lieutenant?
- Yes, sir. Of course.

01:17:52.668 --> 01:17:54.960
- Rather cold, isn't it?
- Oh, yes, sir.

01:18:32.791 --> 01:18:34.291
Well, that was quick.

01:18:34.501 --> 01:18:36.877
Fear lent them wings, as the saying goes.

01:18:37.045 --> 01:18:38.170
What do we do now?

01:18:38.338 --> 01:18:42.383
I think we'd better see how
Cartwright Jones is getting along.

01:19:14.332 --> 01:19:17.835
You are making things
very difficult, Herr General.

01:19:18.003 --> 01:19:22.006
- Very, very difficult, indeed.
There aren't any difficulties, major.

01:19:22.174 --> 01:19:25.468
General Rosemeyer here hasn't forgotten
that Germany's a signatory...

01:19:25.635 --> 01:19:27.344
...to the Hague Convention.

01:19:27.512 --> 01:19:30.681
I have not forgotten,
but my hands are tied.

01:19:30.849 --> 01:19:33.017
I have my orders from Berlin.

01:19:33.185 --> 01:19:35.478
You can tell Berlin
all they're entitled to know.

01:19:35.645 --> 01:19:41.108
I'm General George Carnaby,
United States Army, RA 123-025-3964.

01:19:41.276 --> 01:19:45.780
And one of the chief coordinators
of planning for the second front.

01:19:46.198 --> 01:19:48.407
Which second front is that?

01:19:49.159 --> 01:19:52.328
Well, general, I have done all I can.

01:19:52.496 --> 01:19:55.372
I have tried to hold up the Gestapo.

01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:58.834
I've persuaded the High Command
that the mere fact of your capture...

01:19:59.002 --> 01:20:02.755
...will compel the Allies
to alter their plans...

01:20:03.006 --> 01:20:05.591
...but this, it seems, is not enough.

01:20:05.759 --> 01:20:09.220
For the last time, may I request you
to give us the information?

01:20:09.387 --> 01:20:13.349
General George Carnaby,
United States Army.

01:20:16.728 --> 01:20:19.396
The matter is in your hands, Kramer.

01:20:20.565 --> 01:20:23.734
You know, general,
we have drugs that will make you talk.

01:20:23.902 --> 01:20:27.571
- We do not wish to use them, but...
- Scopolamine. Heh, heh, heh.

01:20:27.739 --> 01:20:29.573
Where's that gonna get you, colonel?

01:20:29.741 --> 01:20:31.992
There are other drugs too.

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:35.621
The lieutenant here is a trained nurse.

01:20:37.791 --> 01:20:39.667
Excuse me.

01:20:40.043 --> 01:20:41.252
Yes?

01:20:44.172 --> 01:20:46.590
And they are who we thought?

01:20:46.758 --> 01:20:48.425
Very good.

01:20:49.219 --> 01:20:51.804
Yes. Yes, you can bring them up now.

01:20:52.848 --> 01:20:56.141
Has there been any further information
about the other two?

01:20:57.894 --> 01:20:59.770
Well, keep me advised.

01:21:03.942 --> 01:21:07.570
Some very interesting company
coming up, general.

01:21:07.946 --> 01:21:10.573
The drugs may not be necessary.

01:21:13.243 --> 01:21:15.786
Don't you think
it's time we make a move?

01:21:17.122 --> 01:21:18.873
Any minute now.

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:21.166
Just be patient.

01:21:50.655 --> 01:21:52.615
A moment.

01:22:03.501 --> 01:22:05.169
Fräulein.

01:22:06.338 --> 01:22:07.922
Did I disturb you?

01:22:08.089 --> 01:22:10.925
- No, I was just going out.
- Well, then I am just in time.

01:22:11.426 --> 01:22:14.678
- You wanted to see me, major?
- Naturally.

01:22:15.305 --> 01:22:16.639
What about?

01:22:19.351 --> 01:22:20.351
Well, nothing.

01:22:20.518 --> 01:22:24.647
I just wanted to see you.
Now, that is not a crime, is it?

01:22:25.065 --> 01:22:26.106
No.

01:22:26.274 --> 01:22:29.944
It's very seldom
we have so pretty a girl here.

01:22:30.362 --> 01:22:34.615
Perhaps I can show you
a little Bavarian hospitality.

01:22:35.033 --> 01:22:37.534
Now, downstairs,
we have an armaments room...

01:22:37.702 --> 01:22:41.080
...which has been converted
into the most marvelous café.

01:22:41.247 --> 01:22:44.249
But my duties,
I have to see the colonel's secretary.

01:22:44.417 --> 01:22:46.752
The colonel's secretary
can wait a little while.

01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:49.046
You and me, we have a lot to talk about.

01:22:49.214 --> 01:22:52.549
- Such as?
- Düsseldorf.

01:22:53.218 --> 01:22:55.803
- Düsseldorf?
- I was a student there for many years.

01:22:55.971 --> 01:22:59.390
From 1929 to 1933.

01:22:59.557 --> 01:23:01.684
To your health, gentlemen.

01:23:06.398 --> 01:23:08.148
You are not drinking, general.

01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:11.735
That's understandable...

01:23:12.237 --> 01:23:16.824
...when your rescuers turn out to be,
well, birds of a different feather.

01:23:18.451 --> 01:23:19.910
And the return trip, gentlemen.

01:23:20.537 --> 01:23:22.538
How was that to be accomplished?

01:23:22.706 --> 01:23:24.415
- Through Switzerland.
- Mm-hm.

01:23:24.582 --> 01:23:27.418
Then it should be quite easy
for you to return to London.

01:23:27.585 --> 01:23:30.546
A rubber dinghy across the Rhine,
and then a short walk.

01:23:30.714 --> 01:23:31.880
You'll be in Whitehall...

01:23:32.048 --> 01:23:35.259
...reporting General Carnaby's
transfer to Berlin before you know it.

01:23:35.427 --> 01:23:40.389
Back to London? Are you mad?
Not with Smith and Schaffer still alive.

01:23:40.890 --> 01:23:42.933
What do you take us for?

01:23:43.101 --> 01:23:47.271
You will also, of course, be reporting
the unfortunate demise of Major Smith.

01:23:48.898 --> 01:23:51.608
- Is he dead?
We are not quite sure.

01:23:52.027 --> 01:23:54.820
- It is being looked into right now.
- It's getting late.

01:23:54.988 --> 01:23:58.824
- Please remember the important issue.
- Yes, sir.

01:23:59.492 --> 01:24:01.952
I think the situation
has changed sufficiently...

01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:05.289
...for you to give us the information
we have been asking for.

01:24:05.457 --> 01:24:07.958
Nothing's changed, colonel.

01:24:09.377 --> 01:24:11.962
Most unfortunate.

01:24:39.491 --> 01:24:43.077
Just a waste of good scopolamine.
Don't move, any of you.

01:24:43.578 --> 01:24:45.245
Lieutenant.

01:24:45.413 --> 01:24:48.832
No, I'd advise you not to, colonel.

01:24:50.502 --> 01:24:54.254
Well, gentlemen, I'm glad to see you all
here, safe and sound, enjoying a drink.

01:24:54.422 --> 01:24:57.299
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

01:24:57.467 --> 01:24:59.510
Lieutenant, drop that gun.

01:25:00.595 --> 01:25:03.013
- What?
- Drop that gun and sit down.

01:25:06.684 --> 01:25:09.520
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Sit down!

01:25:19.030 --> 01:25:22.866
- Major, if I live to be 100...
- Do nothing, lieutenant.

01:25:25.995 --> 01:25:28.372
In your own idiom, you're a punk...

01:25:29.374 --> 01:25:31.875
...and a pretty second-rate punk at that.

01:25:32.043 --> 01:25:37.256
- If I might have some explanation...
- In good time, colonel. All in good time.

01:25:37.423 --> 01:25:40.759
I was about to say scopolamine
would have little effect on our friend...

01:25:40.927 --> 01:25:45.013
...except to prove he's not General Carnaby,
but a certain Cartwright Jones...

01:25:45.181 --> 01:25:47.516
...an American actor
impersonating General Carnaby.

01:25:47.684 --> 01:25:50.644
- Who are you?
- Just a passer-by, as you might say.

01:25:50.812 --> 01:25:53.397
In fact, I think the drug
would probably work better...

01:25:53.565 --> 01:25:56.859
...on our friends at the end of the table.
They're our real enemies.

01:25:57.026 --> 01:25:59.862
- Don't listen to him, general. It's a bluff!
- Keep quiet!

01:26:03.199 --> 01:26:06.869
Allow me to introduce myself.
Major Johann Schmidt.

01:26:07.036 --> 01:26:10.080
SS Military Intelligence, Stuttgart.

01:26:10.248 --> 01:26:12.332
- Can you prove that?
- Certainly, colonel.

01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:15.919
Before I do, I wonder if you'd be
good enough to call one of your guards.

01:26:16.087 --> 01:26:20.591
I don't fancy talking and keeping my eye
on these people at the same time.

01:26:23.052 --> 01:26:24.970
Strange.

01:26:26.890 --> 01:26:29.433
I seem to remember...

01:26:29.601 --> 01:26:32.811
...that the cathedral was
on the other side of the square.

01:26:35.773 --> 01:26:37.524
Well...

01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:41.778
Of course, I might be mistaken.
It's been a long time.

01:26:43.198 --> 01:26:46.408
Oh, no, major.
I could have made a mistake.

01:26:46.576 --> 01:26:49.912
I haven't been to Düsseldorf
for three years.

01:26:50.371 --> 01:26:52.247
It's very easy to forget.

01:26:52.415 --> 01:26:55.500
Yes. It's very easy.

01:26:59.964 --> 01:27:03.133
Fräulein, you seem to be
a little bit distracted.

01:27:04.385 --> 01:27:06.845
- Is anything wrong?
- No. No, it's nothing.

01:27:07.013 --> 01:27:10.807
Just a slight headache.
I've had a long day traveling.

01:27:11.809 --> 01:27:14.311
Oh, yes, of course. And here I am...

01:27:14.479 --> 01:27:18.440
...I'm talking about silly things
like Düsseldorf.

01:27:19.317 --> 01:27:21.485
- You will forgive me?
- Of course.

01:27:21.653 --> 01:27:23.153
Thank you. I tell you what.

01:27:23.321 --> 01:27:27.824
We will have one more schnapps together
and then I'll see you to your quarters.

01:27:27.992 --> 01:27:29.493
- Thank you.
- Fräulein!

01:27:34.832 --> 01:27:38.168
Well, now that we're all comfortable,
the first order of business...

01:27:38.336 --> 01:27:42.381
...is to find out exactly who everybody is
and what they're doing here.

01:27:42.632 --> 01:27:45.008
Now, first the lieutenant.

01:27:45.176 --> 01:27:46.677
He's an assassin...

01:27:46.844 --> 01:27:51.265
...a member of the American
intelligence organization known as OSS.

01:27:51.432 --> 01:27:55.560
His job was to shoot you, Colonel Kramer,
and you, General Rosemeyer.

01:27:55.728 --> 01:27:59.189
Now, General Carnaby's mission
was twofold:

01:27:59.357 --> 01:28:01.233
First, to allow himself to be tortured...

01:28:01.401 --> 01:28:03.986
...into giving you the wrong plans
for the second front.

01:28:04.153 --> 01:28:05.988
And secondly, to afford the British...

01:28:06.155 --> 01:28:09.324
...a perfect excuse to send in
a team of experts to rescue him.

01:28:09.492 --> 01:28:12.286
Which brings us
to our three friends here...

01:28:12.453 --> 01:28:14.871
...and the cleverest phase
of the British operation.

01:28:15.039 --> 01:28:17.416
- They are, of course, members of Ml6.
- That's a lie.

01:28:17.583 --> 01:28:19.543
Let him finish!

01:28:19.711 --> 01:28:22.546
Their job was to penetrate
the German High Command...

01:28:22.714 --> 01:28:26.550
...instead of the real
Thomas, Berkeley and Christiansen...

01:28:26.718 --> 01:28:28.677
...who worked for us in London...

01:28:28.845 --> 01:28:32.472
...and were discovered and captured
by the British about a month ago.

01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:34.850
That's another lie.
You can't prove any of this.

01:28:35.018 --> 01:28:36.601
Can't I?

01:28:37.228 --> 01:28:39.730
Any denials, lieutenant?

01:28:43.234 --> 01:28:46.403
Now, General Carnaby,
perhaps you'd be good enough...

01:28:46.571 --> 01:28:49.698
...to give us your real name, rank
and serial number.

01:29:00.168 --> 01:29:02.627
Cartwright Jones, corporal, U.S. Army...

01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:06.798
...RA 123-025-3964.

01:29:06.966 --> 01:29:08.592
Thank you.

01:29:09.010 --> 01:29:12.763
Having successfully substituted
these three British agents for our men...

01:29:12.930 --> 01:29:15.349
...what was the next phase
of the British plan?

01:29:15.516 --> 01:29:17.934
To penetrate the German High Command.

01:29:18.102 --> 01:29:20.395
How? Simple.

01:29:20.563 --> 01:29:24.733
Stage a fake air crash
with a fake American general on board...

01:29:24.901 --> 01:29:27.444
...send in special agents
to effect his release...

01:29:27.612 --> 01:29:29.738
...be sure that they fail in their mission...

01:29:29.906 --> 01:29:32.115
...and these men
would be taken to Berlin...

01:29:32.283 --> 01:29:35.118
...where they would be
right in the heart of the Wehrmacht.

01:29:35.286 --> 01:29:38.789
And you, Major Schmidt,
what were your orders on this mission?

01:29:39.457 --> 01:29:42.250
To lead them in and make
my own way out through Switzerland.

01:29:42.919 --> 01:29:46.880
- But it... It's incredible.
- Yes.

01:29:47.048 --> 01:29:49.299
But to the British, very, very simple.

01:29:49.842 --> 01:29:52.636
You were going to give us
some proof of who you are.

01:29:52.804 --> 01:29:54.638
Certainly, general.

01:29:54.847 --> 01:29:58.141
The proof is in three parts.
First, if I'm not who I say I am...

01:29:58.309 --> 01:30:01.561
...what am I doing here?
What can I possibly hope to gain?

01:30:01.729 --> 01:30:05.816
The rescue of an impostor,
the exposure of three spies. Who to?

01:30:05.983 --> 01:30:08.652
To the very people
they're supposed to be working for.

01:30:08.820 --> 01:30:11.113
I have nothing to gain.

01:30:11.531 --> 01:30:15.283
Also, if these people
are what they say they are...

01:30:15.451 --> 01:30:19.162
...they would know the name
of our top agent in Whitehall.

01:30:19.330 --> 01:30:21.623
- Yes.
- So why don't we ask them?

01:30:26.838 --> 01:30:29.548
They should know the man
who sent them on this mission.

01:30:29.715 --> 01:30:31.842
We all work through contacts.

01:30:32.009 --> 01:30:34.219
It wasn't necessary
or safe for us to know...

01:30:34.387 --> 01:30:36.304
...where our orders were coming from.

01:30:36.472 --> 01:30:40.517
Then I should be in the same boat as you,
but I know his name and you don't.

01:30:43.813 --> 01:30:45.188
Secondly, colonel, you have...

01:30:45.356 --> 01:30:48.150
...one of the most powerful
radio transmitters in Europe.

01:30:48.317 --> 01:30:51.027
Put a radio telephone call through...

01:30:51.195 --> 01:30:53.864
...to Field Marshal Kesselring's
headquarters in Italy...

01:30:54.031 --> 01:30:58.577
...and ask for his Chief of Intelligence,
a Major Wilhelm Wilner.

01:31:06.878 --> 01:31:09.045
Major. Major.

01:31:09.213 --> 01:31:10.589
Major.

01:31:10.756 --> 01:31:15.760
There's Colonel Kramer on the telephone
from the Schloss Adler in Bavaria.

01:31:16.345 --> 01:31:18.472
He says it's very urgent.

01:31:19.891 --> 01:31:21.725
Major Wilner speaking.

01:31:22.643 --> 01:31:23.727
Ja, colonel.

01:31:23.895 --> 01:31:27.397
- Can you describe him?
- That will not be necessary.

01:31:27.565 --> 01:31:29.566
Ask him to show you his right forearm.

01:31:30.401 --> 01:31:34.070
- May I see your right forearm?
- Certainly.

01:31:35.198 --> 01:31:39.868
There are two
parallel scars, about three centimeters apart.

01:31:40.036 --> 01:31:41.286
The scars are there.

01:31:42.079 --> 01:31:43.747
Ask how did he get them.

01:31:44.332 --> 01:31:46.541
- How did you get those?
- I was born with them.

01:31:46.709 --> 01:31:48.084
He says he was born with them.

01:31:48.461 --> 01:31:51.296
That is right. Then tell him he's a traitor.

01:31:51.631 --> 01:31:52.797
Tell him he's a renegade.

01:31:54.592 --> 01:31:57.010
That is Schmidt. No question about it.

01:31:58.221 --> 01:32:01.306
- Thank you, major.
- Thank you, colonel.

01:32:01.474 --> 01:32:03.433
Good night.

01:32:04.352 --> 01:32:06.478
Give me the water.

01:32:10.775 --> 01:32:13.777
As you know, the real Thomas,
Christiansen and Berkeley...

01:32:13.945 --> 01:32:16.696
...while working
for British counterespionage...

01:32:16.864 --> 01:32:21.368
...were responsible for setting up an
excellent chain of agents throughout Britain.

01:32:21.536 --> 01:32:24.246
Now, if these men are
who they claim to be...

01:32:24.413 --> 01:32:25.914
...it would be reasonable...

01:32:26.082 --> 01:32:29.292
...to expect them to be able
to write down a list of those agents.

01:32:29.460 --> 01:32:32.754
You could then compare their lists
with the genuine one...

01:32:32.922 --> 01:32:36.132
...which I have in this book.
- There's something very wrong, colonel.

01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:40.053
I don't doubt who Schmidt is,
but there has been some mistake.

01:32:40.221 --> 01:32:43.348
Yes, and you're the ones
who have made it.

01:32:43.516 --> 01:32:47.644
Fräulein, would you be good enough
to get some pencils and some notebooks...

01:32:47.812 --> 01:32:51.356
...and we'll soon find out
who's speaking the truth.

01:32:54.068 --> 01:32:57.529
Good night, Maria.
You are a most charming girl.

01:32:57.697 --> 01:32:58.989
Good night and thank you.

01:32:59.156 --> 01:33:01.283
We must get to know each other
a little better.

01:33:01.450 --> 01:33:02.867
- Yes.
- Good night.

01:33:03.035 --> 01:33:04.661
Good night.

01:33:57.340 --> 01:33:59.424
Any one of these will do.

01:34:29.747 --> 01:34:32.332
Now compare it with my original.

01:34:47.682 --> 01:34:48.890
Guard!

01:34:52.687 --> 01:34:54.104
Stay as you were, gentlemen.

01:34:55.314 --> 01:34:56.481
Just relax.

01:35:01.946 --> 01:35:03.279
Second-rate punk, huh?

01:35:04.407 --> 01:35:06.574
All I could think of
on the spur of the moment.

01:35:06.742 --> 01:35:10.286
- Thanks. That even makes it worse.
- Sorry.

01:35:10.955 --> 01:35:13.957
Well, between them,
they shouldn't have missed anything.

01:35:14.125 --> 01:35:17.711
This is all you want. Those books?
- Lots of nice names and addresses.

01:35:19.296 --> 01:35:22.799
And these men?
Then they are who they claim to be?

01:35:23.718 --> 01:35:26.928
I'm afraid so. They've been
under suspicion for some time.

01:35:27.096 --> 01:35:31.141
Classified information was going out
and useless information was coming in.

01:35:31.308 --> 01:35:34.936
It took several weeks to pin it on
the departments controlled by those men.

01:35:35.104 --> 01:35:37.522
But we knew we couldn't prove it.
Even if we could...

01:35:37.690 --> 01:35:40.316
...what we really wanted
was the names of their contacts.

01:35:40.484 --> 01:35:43.820
These names and addresses.
So we thought this plan up.

01:35:43.988 --> 01:35:46.322
And Wilner,
Kesselring's Chief of Intelligence?

01:35:46.490 --> 01:35:49.159
He truly believes me
to be one of his top agents in Italy.

01:35:49.326 --> 01:35:53.246
I've been feeding him useless, false and
out-of-date information for a couple years.

01:35:53.414 --> 01:35:55.165
- All right, gentlemen...
Stay where you are!

01:35:58.878 --> 01:36:02.964
I'd advise everyone to keep perfectly still.

01:36:04.842 --> 01:36:07.051
Drop your gun, major.

01:36:09.180 --> 01:36:11.264
You too, lieutenant.

01:36:19.148 --> 01:36:20.273
By the fireplace.

01:36:23.861 --> 01:36:25.862
Thank God you're here.
We were just about...

01:36:26.030 --> 01:36:28.740
Sit down, colonel!

01:36:34.914 --> 01:36:38.291
Everybody remain as he is...

01:36:39.585 --> 01:36:43.421
...until I find out
what exactly is going on here.

01:36:43.589 --> 01:36:45.799
What do you mean?
Surely, you can see what's...

01:36:45.966 --> 01:36:49.469
Sit down, colonel.

01:36:49.637 --> 01:36:52.388
It's perfectly simple.
The lieutenant and myself...

01:36:52.556 --> 01:36:54.974
...have uncovered a plot
to assassinate the Führer.

01:36:55.267 --> 01:36:58.269
- This is preposterous!
- General!

01:36:59.063 --> 01:37:00.104
Sit down.

01:37:03.275 --> 01:37:06.945
These people were all involved in
a conspiracy to overthrow the Third Reich.

01:37:07.112 --> 01:37:09.906
In my pocket here,
I have the names of all the conspirators.

01:37:10.074 --> 01:37:13.284
Just before you interrupted us,
we put this entire party under arrest.

01:37:13.577 --> 01:37:17.080
The list in his pocket are the names
of German agents working in Britain!

01:37:17.414 --> 01:37:19.249
I don't expect you to believe me, major.

01:37:19.875 --> 01:37:24.128
But you'll certainly believe these names
if you'll permit me to show them to you.

01:37:27.383 --> 01:37:29.342
Let me see them.

01:37:31.804 --> 01:37:34.222
Careful, major.

01:37:35.933 --> 01:37:37.725
Go very slowly.

01:37:52.908 --> 01:38:00.665
Bring them here.

01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:02.959
Smith.

01:38:15.472 --> 01:38:18.808
All of you, get up! Stand over there.

01:38:19.184 --> 01:38:20.894
Put your hands up.

01:38:22.021 --> 01:38:23.980
Put your hands up!

01:38:24.815 --> 01:38:27.650
Jones, see if you can find
something to tie them up with.

01:38:27.818 --> 01:38:29.903
Mary, bring that bag over here.

01:38:32.823 --> 01:38:35.408
- What do we do with these three?
- We take them with us.

01:38:35.576 --> 01:38:36.618
You were late.

01:38:36.785 --> 01:38:39.621
- One day I won't come at all.
- Keep your eye on those three.

01:38:39.788 --> 01:38:41.497
Lieutenant, in the next 15 minutes...

01:38:41.665 --> 01:38:44.667
...we have to create enough confusion
to get out of here alive.

01:38:44.835 --> 01:38:48.421
Major, right now you got me
about as confused as I ever hope to be.

01:38:48.589 --> 01:38:51.382
The armory's here.
If we blow it up, the castle will think...

01:38:51.550 --> 01:38:53.343
...it's being attacked by a division.

01:38:53.552 --> 01:38:56.346
On the other side of the castle over here
is the radio room.

01:38:56.513 --> 01:38:59.641
I'll take the others and meet you there.
You take the map.

01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:10.693
Mary, we're going.

01:39:12.613 --> 01:39:15.531
Let me make myself
perfectly understood.

01:39:15.699 --> 01:39:20.703
If any of you utters a word, I'll kill you all.
You understand?

01:39:20.871 --> 01:39:23.456
- Jones, get the major's gun. Now move.
- Yes, sir.

01:39:23.624 --> 01:39:24.958
Move!

01:39:25.125 --> 01:39:26.668
Go!

01:39:55.614 --> 01:39:57.281
This way.

01:40:19.388 --> 01:40:21.097
Jones.

01:42:05.369 --> 01:42:09.413
Wait. Go back. Jones, go on.
Mary, get in. Get in there.

01:42:38.443 --> 01:42:40.361
At ease.

01:42:43.866 --> 01:42:45.575
Hello.

01:44:32.307 --> 01:44:33.349
Get them in.

01:46:54.282 --> 01:46:56.784
All right, inside, quickly.

01:47:03.667 --> 01:47:05.543
You may need this.

01:47:31.361 --> 01:47:35.364
Broadsword calling Danny Boy.

01:47:42.414 --> 01:47:45.708
- We got company.
- Broadsword calling Danny Boy.

01:48:20.410 --> 01:49:18.801
Broadsword calling Danny Boy.

01:49:27.435 --> 01:49:31.355
Get the rest of the men out of here
and report to the Kommandant.

01:49:42.325 --> 01:49:45.369
Danny Boy calling Broadsword. Over.

01:49:45.537 --> 01:49:48.622
Everything ready.
We need transport. Understood?

01:49:48.790 --> 01:49:50.833
- Over.
- Understood.

01:49:51.001 --> 01:49:53.502
Do you have it? Over.

01:49:53.670 --> 01:49:56.672
We have it. We have it all. Over.

01:49:56.840 --> 01:49:58.215
All sins forgiven.

01:50:05.348 --> 01:50:07.099
Damn it.

01:50:21.948 --> 01:50:24.658
Get Thomas out of there. Quickly.

01:50:34.502 --> 01:50:35.794
Now!

01:50:50.101 --> 01:50:52.603
Get out. Climb out.

01:50:52.771 --> 01:50:54.146
Get on with it!

01:51:05.867 --> 01:51:07.534
Grenades.

01:51:40.193 --> 01:51:41.944
Corporal!

01:52:02.215 --> 01:52:05.551
Outside! Out! Out!

01:52:39.127 --> 01:52:40.753
All right.

01:52:41.671 --> 01:52:43.672
Lieutenant, get the rope.

01:53:17.791 --> 01:53:19.792
Back. Get back.

01:53:39.229 --> 01:53:41.522
All right, to the right.

01:54:20.854 --> 01:54:22.813
Quick. Move it.

01:54:30.071 --> 01:54:32.447
Damn! Blast it!

01:54:33.700 --> 01:54:35.409
Get moving.

01:54:53.177 --> 01:54:55.554
All right. Get those men untied.

01:54:58.808 --> 01:55:03.312
Better put those coats on if you don't
want to freeze to death. Quickly, now.

01:56:14.384 --> 01:56:15.384
Christiansen.

01:57:02.056 --> 01:57:04.725
Jones, get them out. Mary.

01:57:44.390 --> 01:57:47.851
Watch them. Right.

01:59:59.025 --> 02:00:03.445
- The doors to the corridor are locked.
- See what winch controls they have.

02:00:11.245 --> 02:00:15.498
- There's a stop and start button.
- See if you can make the motor work.

02:00:20.213 --> 02:00:22.464
Not bad, huh?
- Yes, good.

02:00:22.632 --> 02:00:26.635
Now bring it down here and we'll get
on top, and you can take us back inside.

02:00:32.225 --> 02:00:35.560
- Mary, bring them out here!
- Go on.

02:00:46.530 --> 02:00:48.949
Get ahold of the rope and climb down.

02:00:50.785 --> 02:00:52.661
Climb down!

02:01:29.156 --> 02:01:30.782
Look out!

02:01:43.546 --> 02:01:45.380
Schaffer?

02:01:46.590 --> 02:01:49.592
Schaffer? Schaffer?

02:01:49.844 --> 02:01:53.763
We've got him, Smith! Now, listen, Smith.

02:01:53.931 --> 02:01:55.557
I'll make a deal with you.

02:01:55.975 --> 02:02:00.645
You let us go down in the car
and we won't kill Schaffer.

02:02:03.733 --> 02:02:04.774
Smith!

02:02:04.942 --> 02:02:07.610
You bring him out
so I can see he's still alive.

02:02:10.364 --> 02:02:12.407
I'm bringing him out now.

02:02:12.700 --> 02:02:14.743
Get in the car.

02:03:13.969 --> 02:03:15.762
Give me that.

02:03:26.023 --> 02:03:27.857
Damn it!

02:03:34.156 --> 02:03:36.741
Up there. Get him!

02:05:22.681 --> 02:05:25.141
Help me. No.

02:05:29.438 --> 02:05:32.106
No. No!

02:05:36.445 --> 02:05:38.446
Help me.

02:05:46.288 --> 02:05:47.288
Please.

02:05:57.132 --> 02:06:01.636
No!

02:08:28.784 --> 02:08:30.618
Lieutenant.

02:08:34.123 --> 02:08:36.457
- Where's the major?
- He's on the cable car.

02:10:15.849 --> 02:10:17.725
Jones, the bag.

02:10:33.700 --> 02:10:35.368
Let's go.

02:11:49.276 --> 02:11:52.153
Set the bombs to go off
in three and a half minutes.

02:12:24.353 --> 02:12:26.729
- Almost ready?
- Almost.

02:12:27.648 --> 02:12:30.858
Jones. Mary.

02:12:38.617 --> 02:12:39.700
All set.

02:12:45.374 --> 02:12:46.707
Go.

02:14:29.102 --> 02:14:33.064
- Twenty-five minutes. Can we make it?
- We can make it.

02:14:33.231 --> 02:14:35.733
- Point is, will they?
- God knows.

02:15:07.057 --> 02:15:09.350
Everybody on the floor.

02:16:10.078 --> 02:16:13.122
Emergency. Get me
the Oberhausen Airfield immediately.

02:16:52.287 --> 02:16:56.624
- We've got company.
- Yeah, I saw them in the mirror.

02:16:59.835 --> 02:17:02.463
How long before we reach the poles?

02:17:02.630 --> 02:17:04.632
Just around the next turn.

02:17:05.091 --> 02:17:07.259
Oberhausen Airfield?

02:17:08.386 --> 02:17:10.054
Give me the Kommandant's office.

02:19:34.281 --> 02:19:35.907
Get ready.

02:21:23.725 --> 02:21:25.726
Set the rest of them and get out of here.

02:23:50.204 --> 02:23:54.207
Oberhausen control tower.
Oberhausen control tower.

02:23:55.043 --> 02:23:56.668
Oberhausen control. Over.

02:23:57.253 --> 02:24:01.798
I'm in serious trouble.
Request urgent permission to land. Over.

02:24:02.925 --> 02:24:05.802
Identify. Over.

02:24:05.970 --> 02:24:07.095
Leutnant Ulrich.

02:24:07.555 --> 02:24:11.516
Third Jaeger Junker squadron
on night navigational exercise.

02:24:11.684 --> 02:24:14.394
One engine out. Losing altitude. Over.

02:24:15.271 --> 02:24:17.397
You are cleared
for immediate landing. Over.

02:24:17.565 --> 02:24:19.650
Coming in. Over.

02:25:59.459 --> 02:26:03.003
Fighter Wing 126,
Oberhausen Airfield calling. Over.

02:26:03.504 --> 02:26:04.963
Fighter Wing 126, Ober...

02:26:05.965 --> 02:26:08.175
Get the control tower.

02:26:10.845 --> 02:26:12.262
Come in... Aah!

02:27:26.504 --> 02:27:28.088
Get down.

02:28:33.446 --> 02:28:37.032
- Berkeley wrote these names?
- Yes, sir.

02:28:38.993 --> 02:28:43.079
Ted Berkeley. I can't believe it.

02:28:43.247 --> 02:28:46.958
And Thomas. And Christiansen.

02:28:48.169 --> 02:28:50.003
All three of them?

02:28:52.131 --> 02:28:55.842
- My God, it's incredible.
- Yes, quite.

02:28:56.010 --> 02:29:01.014
But not as incredible as the one name
that's missing from that list, colonel.

02:29:02.683 --> 02:29:05.310
What name is that, major?

02:29:05.853 --> 02:29:09.314
I have it in this notebook
here in my pocket.

02:29:09.482 --> 02:29:12.275
Earlier tonight, I showed it
to Colonel Kramer.

02:29:12.443 --> 02:29:17.405
He agreed with me that this was
the top German agent in Britain.

02:29:30.211 --> 02:29:32.796
It's your name, colonel.
Don't look so shocked.

02:29:33.339 --> 02:29:35.799
Surely, you suspected it.

02:29:36.008 --> 02:29:38.051
Otherwise, why were you here
to meet us?

02:29:39.053 --> 02:29:40.595
In case you were found out?

02:29:43.891 --> 02:29:45.642
Go on.

02:29:47.061 --> 02:29:49.813
You see, you underestimated
Admiral Rolland.

02:29:49.981 --> 02:29:52.482
He'd suspected you and the others
for some time.

02:29:52.775 --> 02:29:56.069
He brought me and Mary back from Italy
because we were the only two...

02:29:56.237 --> 02:29:59.239
...in his department that he could trust,
yourself included.

02:29:59.865 --> 02:30:02.534
He asked you to choose a leader
for this expedition.

02:30:03.160 --> 02:30:05.829
You chose me because you knew
from German intelligence...

02:30:05.997 --> 02:30:09.207
...that I was a double agent.

02:30:09.834 --> 02:30:12.752
Admiral Rolland knew I was not.

02:30:12.920 --> 02:30:15.755
But for you, I was the perfect choice.

02:30:16.215 --> 02:30:20.719
- Now you're guessing, Smith.
- No guesswork, colonel.

02:30:20.886 --> 02:30:24.889
Your pointing that gun at me
is sufficient evidence.

02:30:28.269 --> 02:30:30.603
You are pointing it at me, aren't you?

02:30:32.648 --> 02:30:33.898
Go on.

02:30:34.066 --> 02:30:37.736
Mary was brought on the mission without
your knowledge because I needed her...

02:30:37.903 --> 02:30:41.156
...to get me into the castle.
The lieutenant, being an American...

02:30:41.323 --> 02:30:43.324
...had no possible connection with Ml6...

02:30:43.492 --> 02:30:46.036
...and was the only member of the group
I could trust.

02:30:46.203 --> 02:30:48.788
I wasn't even sure of
Harrod and MacPherson...

02:30:48.956 --> 02:30:50.582
...until they were killed by the others.

02:30:53.210 --> 02:30:57.130
Fascinating. Very fascinating.

02:30:57.298 --> 02:30:59.049
Perhaps even true.

02:31:00.593 --> 02:31:03.678
- Assuming for a moment...
- You're finished, colonel.

02:31:08.893 --> 02:31:14.147
- You're overlooking something, aren't you?
- Not at all.

02:31:14.648 --> 02:31:17.567
Admiral Rolland took you
to the plane himself, didn't he?

02:31:18.152 --> 02:31:22.238
He also made certain
that you had that gun, didn't he?

02:31:22.948 --> 02:31:27.368
We took the precaution of removing
the firing pin before the mission started.

02:31:36.295 --> 02:31:37.754
Put it down, colonel.

02:31:42.676 --> 02:31:46.679
Not so hasty, lieutenant.
We mustn't cheat the hangman.

02:31:50.726 --> 02:31:53.353
What now, major?

02:31:53.896 --> 02:31:56.272
You'll be tried for treason.

02:32:00.069 --> 02:32:03.404
A public trial would be embarrassing.

02:32:03.572 --> 02:32:06.366
Painful, not only for myself...

02:32:06.534 --> 02:32:10.703
...but also for British Intelligence
and Admiral Rolland.

02:32:11.122 --> 02:32:15.542
Perhaps, but not as painful as
that long drop to the end of the rope.

02:32:19.463 --> 02:32:21.047
Well...

02:32:22.383 --> 02:32:27.554
...I seem to have no cards left to play,
do I?

02:32:28.806 --> 02:32:30.056
No, colonel, you don't.

02:32:31.725 --> 02:32:35.395
- Do I have an alternative?
- If you want it.

02:32:43.571 --> 02:32:44.904
Mm.

02:32:47.992 --> 02:32:49.659
Thank you.

02:32:51.078 --> 02:32:54.247
I'll have those books.

02:33:45.799 --> 02:33:48.092
Well, is that it, major?

02:33:48.844 --> 02:33:51.346
Yes, that's it, lieutenant.

02:33:53.015 --> 02:33:54.307
Do me a favor, will you?

02:33:54.475 --> 02:33:58.811
Next time you have one of these things,
keep it an all-British operation.

02:34:00.522 --> 02:34:02.398
I'll try, lieutenant.
