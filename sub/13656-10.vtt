00:06.399 --> 00:07.632
Congratulations.

00:10.169 --> 00:12.190
How is 63rd street school
doing? Great to see you.

00:12.258 --> 00:13.524
Good to see you.

00:13.592 --> 00:15.521
Keep up the good work.
Thanks so much.

00:15.589 --> 00:18.401
Oh, oh, Mr. Mayor.

00:18.468 --> 00:19.836
Um...

00:35.429 --> 00:37.163
We know that the job of
superintendent of our schools,

00:37.231 --> 00:40.432
to which Dr. Massoud
is about to dedicate himself,

00:40.500 --> 00:41.734
is not an easy one.

00:41.802 --> 00:43.402
As mayor, I thank him

00:43.470 --> 00:46.372
for putting
his inspirational leadership

00:46.440 --> 00:48.940
at the disposal
of our city's youth.

00:49.008 --> 00:52.712
Dr. Massoud, we are here
not only to wish you luck,

00:52.780 --> 00:53.881
but to offer you our support.

00:53.949 --> 00:54.883
Hear, hear!

00:54.951 --> 00:56.451
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

00:57.921 --> 00:59.724
Now, Judge Cully,
let's get this thing over with

00:59.792 --> 01:01.459
before the good doctor
changes his mind.

01:06.631 --> 01:08.665
Raise your right hand
and repeat after me.

01:08.767 --> 01:11.503
I, Dr. Aamil Massoud...

01:11.570 --> 01:13.706
I, Dr. Aamil Massoud...

01:13.774 --> 01:15.208
having been appointed
to the office

01:15.275 --> 01:16.809
of school
superintendent...

01:16.877 --> 01:18.678
having been appointed to the
office of school...

01:18.746 --> 01:19.679
Judge?

01:19.747 --> 01:21.581
Judge, you all right?

01:21.649 --> 01:22.849
Judge...

01:22.917 --> 01:25.684
oh, my God!
Can I have some help here?!

01:25.752 --> 01:27.553
Someone call 911!

01:27.620 --> 01:29.754
Lay him down.
Lay him down.

01:29.822 --> 01:31.456
Easy, easy.

01:35.627 --> 01:38.428
Judge Cully! Judge Cully!
Look at me... a-are you in pain?

01:38.496 --> 01:39.763
Please te...

01:39.831 --> 01:41.297
what the hell?

01:43.500 --> 01:44.667
Oh, my God.

01:44.734 --> 01:45.967
Help me! Help me!
He's been shot!

01:47.336 --> 01:49.304
Sir,
you need to leave <i>now.</i>

01:49.372 --> 01:50.706
Somebody help me!

01:50.807 --> 01:53.509
Get them out of here... now!

01:53.577 --> 01:56.012
Come on!
Out, out, out! Out!

01:58.000 --> 02:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:08.961 --> 02:11.663
Throw up
a six-block perimeter.

02:11.731 --> 02:14.968
Get airships checking rooftops
right now.

02:15.035 --> 02:18.571
And get me an ETA
on paramedics, damn it!

02:19.907 --> 02:22.376
Chief Taylor!

02:37.761 --> 02:41.365
5.56, boat-tail
match-grade round.

02:41.432 --> 02:43.300
This comes from
a precision rifle.

02:43.368 --> 02:45.369
We're talking
professional hit here.

02:51.443 --> 02:53.411
Did you hear a gunshot?

02:53.479 --> 02:55.414
There was a little snap.

02:55.482 --> 02:57.717
I...Didn't think much of it
at the time.

02:57.785 --> 03:01.288
I thought the judge
was having a heart attack.

03:01.389 --> 03:04.758
Does threat management have
any background on our victim?

03:04.826 --> 03:07.661
No, but Dr. Massoud received
five death threats

03:07.729 --> 03:09.430
in the last two weeks,

03:09.498 --> 03:12.033
mostly from parents worried
about a Muslim being in charge

03:12.101 --> 03:13.869
of their children...
that sort of thing.

03:13.936 --> 03:16.972
Look, Massoud's on his way
to Major Crimes,

03:17.073 --> 03:18.741
waiting to talk to you.

03:18.809 --> 03:20.076
Thank you, chief.

03:25.083 --> 03:27.951
Do you have any idea
of the sniper's location yet?

03:28.019 --> 03:29.320
Just a second.

03:29.421 --> 03:31.989
Flynn!
Flynn, give me a hand up here.

03:32.090 --> 03:35.826
All right, Buzz, show Flynn
where the victim was standing.

03:35.928 --> 03:37.662
Here... like this.

03:44.036 --> 03:45.604
Height
of the entry wound...

03:47.073 --> 03:48.773
54 inches...

03:48.841 --> 03:50.976
just above the heart,
right there.

03:51.043 --> 03:52.110
And the exit wound?

03:52.178 --> 03:53.578
Exit...

03:55.214 --> 03:57.849
44 inches... just to the right
of the spine.

03:58.951 --> 04:00.485
That's about the angle.

04:00.553 --> 04:01.853
Excuse me.

04:01.954 --> 04:04.456
Which puts the killer...

04:04.523 --> 04:06.591
Somewhere up... There.

04:31.017 --> 04:32.184
Yeah?

04:32.252 --> 04:33.719
I'm 10 minutes out.
Were you followed?

04:33.786 --> 04:35.688
Negative. My position
has not been compromised.

04:35.755 --> 04:37.423
Requesting release authority
at this time.

04:37.491 --> 04:40.059
Yes. As always, however,
you must guarantee no witnesses.

04:40.127 --> 04:42.128
Roger that. I expect payment
on confirmation.

04:42.196 --> 04:43.196
You got it.
Out.

05:01.181 --> 05:02.982
This won't be
the proper angle,

05:03.050 --> 05:05.518
because I think the killer
stood back from the window

05:05.586 --> 05:08.855
to avoid being seen
before pulling the trigger.

05:08.923 --> 05:10.523
Take a look
for yourself.

05:59.910 --> 06:01.144
Wait a second.

06:01.211 --> 06:03.479
Target was
about 500 yards away.

06:03.580 --> 06:05.548
Usually you need a spotter
for a shot like this.

06:05.616 --> 06:06.783
Not always.

06:06.851 --> 06:08.885
A pro might have
special equipment.

06:10.087 --> 06:13.690
Looks like a screen was across
this entry to the balcony.

06:13.757 --> 06:15.792
And he left the tape,
Captain.

06:15.860 --> 06:17.560
A screen wouldn't interfere
with his optics,

06:17.628 --> 06:19.128
and it would make him invisible
from the street.

06:19.196 --> 06:21.130
But he didn't just stand
right here.

06:21.198 --> 06:23.599
He had to be higher
somehow.

06:26.603 --> 06:28.104
Ooh.

06:28.172 --> 06:29.839
Let's get SID to go
through this place inch by inch.

06:29.906 --> 06:31.073
Get Buzz
to check security cameras

06:31.141 --> 06:32.708
surrounding the building.

06:32.775 --> 06:34.910
See if any of them caught
our shooter coming or going.

06:37.980 --> 06:41.083
Mr. Reyes, you said
this apartment's on the market?

06:41.150 --> 06:42.551
Yes, ma'am.

06:42.618 --> 06:43.885
Who has keys to it?

06:43.953 --> 06:47.256
Um... Everyone
at the sales desk, me,

06:47.323 --> 06:49.291
and, um, I have
a spare set at home.

06:49.359 --> 06:51.726
Hey, Captain.
Look at this.

06:51.794 --> 06:53.962
I think someone was standing
right here.

06:59.034 --> 07:00.101
Who are you?

07:00.169 --> 07:01.702
Oh, hey.

07:01.770 --> 07:03.804
I, uh, was just visiting
a friend in the building,

07:03.872 --> 07:06.007
and thought I'd check
the place out that's for sale.

07:06.074 --> 07:07.141
It was unlocked...

07:19.054 --> 07:21.022
Looks like
we had a witness.

07:21.090 --> 07:22.323
I don't see any blood.

07:22.391 --> 07:25.359
Maybe this supposed witness
got away.

07:41.377 --> 07:45.279
Two sets of footprints coming
out of the stairwell, Captain.

07:45.347 --> 07:49.350
So, no blood anywhere...
No more gunshots...

07:49.418 --> 07:51.686
Sykes, check if
there's a body down here.

07:53.155 --> 07:54.822
Skid marks.

08:02.298 --> 08:03.698
And they're fresh.

08:06.001 --> 08:08.737
Looks like
there's another set down there.

08:48.878 --> 08:50.912
Hey, Buzz.

08:50.980 --> 08:52.814
Is it time-stamped?

08:52.915 --> 08:54.015
How clear is the video?

08:56.152 --> 08:58.786
The parking garage
exits onto a one-way street,

08:58.854 --> 09:00.755
and there's an atm
on the first corner.

09:00.823 --> 09:04.058
Now... Here we are
six minutes after the shooting,

09:04.126 --> 09:05.893
and watch this car
running the red light.

09:05.961 --> 09:07.361
My guess...
that's our witness

09:07.429 --> 09:09.063
trying to get
the hell out of there.

09:09.131 --> 09:10.898
Get a better look
at the license plate.

09:12.534 --> 09:15.002
Maybe I can work some pixel
magic on it. May take a while.

09:15.070 --> 09:17.772
A Phoenix. There's not
many of them around.

09:17.839 --> 09:21.175
I'll look up late-'70s Pontiacs
and see what we find, Captain.

09:21.243 --> 09:22.743
Thank you, Detective.

09:22.811 --> 09:24.045
Let it play, Buzz.

09:26.315 --> 09:27.382
Freeze it there.

09:27.450 --> 09:28.383
And enlarge it.

09:28.450 --> 09:30.084
No side-view mirror.

09:30.152 --> 09:32.353
And we just happened to find one
in the parking garage.

09:32.454 --> 09:34.255
That's not a coincidence.

09:34.323 --> 09:36.024
Looks like the shooter
was still chasing our witness.

09:36.091 --> 09:40.161
Captain Raydor,
this is Dr. Aamil Massoud.

09:40.228 --> 09:44.132
Agent Howard and I
have been arranging protection

09:44.199 --> 09:45.433
for he and his family

09:45.500 --> 09:46.934
until we can
sort this whole thing out.

09:47.002 --> 09:48.469
We'll also monitor
the hate-group websites,

09:48.537 --> 09:49.804
see if we get
any chatter.

09:49.871 --> 09:50.971
Thank you,
special agent Howard.

09:51.039 --> 09:52.273
Dr. Massoud.

09:52.340 --> 09:54.475
Assassinations are usually
about something

09:54.542 --> 09:56.076
bigger than the target.

09:56.144 --> 09:59.446
Were you proposing any
educational policy changes...

09:59.514 --> 10:01.015
if you're asking
if I suggested

10:01.082 --> 10:02.783
imposing sharia law
on the student body,

10:02.851 --> 10:04.785
my answer
is an emphatic "no."

10:04.853 --> 10:07.054
My most controversial
suggestion so far

10:07.122 --> 10:10.058
seems to have been updating
the sex-education courses.

10:10.125 --> 10:12.827
Hey. Got a seating chart
of the doctor's swearing-in.

10:12.895 --> 10:17.532
Shows where everyone is
supposed to be on the platform.

10:17.600 --> 10:18.967
Even has Judge Cully

10:19.034 --> 10:20.835
and Dr. Massoud
at the microphone.

10:20.903 --> 10:22.904
All right,
if this is north,

10:22.972 --> 10:25.040
then 500 yards
to the southeast over here

10:25.107 --> 10:27.976
is what the sniper would call
his "hide."

10:28.044 --> 10:31.914
Dr. Massoud, uh, is this
where you were positioned

10:31.982 --> 10:33.416
on the platform
this morning?

10:33.517 --> 10:35.185
It is, yes.

10:35.252 --> 10:37.353
And the way
we rehearsed it yesterday, too.

10:37.421 --> 10:39.188
You rehearsed it?
Yes.

10:39.256 --> 10:41.524
So everyone was where
they were supposed to be.

10:43.294 --> 10:44.394
Strange.

10:48.632 --> 10:49.899
Uh... Captain?

10:49.967 --> 10:51.067
Hmm?

10:51.135 --> 10:52.602
Were you expecting
Rusty's father?

10:59.542 --> 11:01.443
I left <i>several</i> messages

11:01.545 --> 11:03.846
apologizing to you and Rusty
about what happened.

11:03.913 --> 11:06.081
And maybe you're not calling me
back because you're mad,

11:06.149 --> 11:07.549
but you don't have
all the facts.

11:07.617 --> 11:08.984
And you need
to hear them.

11:09.052 --> 11:10.919
I look forward to that,
Daniel.

11:10.987 --> 11:13.555
Take a seat in my office.
I'll be with you shortly.

11:17.026 --> 11:18.460
I think I know

11:18.528 --> 11:22.030
how the killer managed
without a spotter, Captain.

11:22.098 --> 11:24.433
It's the right shot
target system.

11:24.501 --> 11:26.902
It's a top-of-the-line
sight attachment

11:26.970 --> 11:30.004
that projects the precise point
of impact into the rifle scope,

11:30.072 --> 11:31.405
taking into account
all the factors

11:31.473 --> 11:33.874
that interfere
with a long-distance shot...

11:33.942 --> 11:36.542
weather, wind velocity,
barometric pressure.

11:36.610 --> 11:39.110
Makes it nearly impossible
to miss.

11:39.177 --> 11:40.911
Then why didn't he hit
his target?

11:44.248 --> 11:46.215
Maybe he did.

11:51.154 --> 11:55.924
Our shooter wasn't aiming
at Dr. Massoud.

12:02.331 --> 12:04.532
He was aiming
at Judge Cully.

12:20.175 --> 12:22.810
I made a mistake.
I'm not denying it.

12:22.877 --> 12:24.478
I feel terrible
about how I lost my temper,

12:24.546 --> 12:27.415
but... You only have
one side of this story.

12:27.482 --> 12:29.316
Okay.

12:29.384 --> 12:30.951
But before you fill in
the blanks,

12:31.019 --> 12:33.021
I want to establish
some facts.

12:33.088 --> 12:35.757
You came here today on your own,
not at my request,

12:35.824 --> 12:37.425
to make
a spontaneous statement.

12:37.493 --> 12:38.526
Is that correct?

12:38.594 --> 12:40.361
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right.

12:40.429 --> 12:42.197
All right. Go ahead.

12:42.264 --> 12:45.434
My fiancée, Annie, is <i>very
</i> protective of her little girls,

12:45.501 --> 12:49.270
and Rusty just
drops this bombshell on us.

12:49.338 --> 12:52.040
Look, I get that he was
in a tough situation.

12:52.141 --> 12:53.375
But what he did...

12:53.476 --> 12:57.012
the way that he sold himself
on the street...

12:57.080 --> 12:59.547
it shows
such terrible judgment.

12:59.615 --> 13:02.117
The idea of taking a kid
that has done that kind of stuff

13:02.185 --> 13:03.952
and putting him
into a normal family,

13:04.020 --> 13:05.053
it freaked Annie out.

13:05.154 --> 13:06.354
Oh, I can't imagine.

13:06.422 --> 13:07.555
I had to take Rusty
outside

13:07.623 --> 13:09.791
just so she had a chance
to calm down.

13:09.859 --> 13:12.827
And... Explain to him
why he should apologize.

13:12.895 --> 13:15.330
The words that he used...
I could tell you what he said.

13:15.398 --> 13:16.498
No, it's not necessary.

13:16.566 --> 13:18.568
Okay.

13:18.635 --> 13:21.003
Anyway, he ends up
calling me an asshole,

13:21.071 --> 13:22.238
and I hit him.

13:22.306 --> 13:24.874
It was much harder
than I intended.

13:24.942 --> 13:26.476
And I had no idea
that he would run off.

13:26.543 --> 13:28.544
And I ju... I wanted...
I wanted to discipline the kid.

13:28.612 --> 13:31.981
He...
<i>needs</i> discipline.

13:32.049 --> 13:33.883
Is that what you told
your fiancée...

13:33.951 --> 13:38.821
that Rusty disappeared
because you disciplined him?

13:38.889 --> 13:40.923
Uh... Wh... n-no.

13:41.025 --> 13:42.525
No, I-I-I-I said
that he ran off

13:42.592 --> 13:44.360
and that
I-I couldn't catch him,

13:44.428 --> 13:45.895
which is true...
that happened.

13:45.962 --> 13:47.930
But... I...

13:48.031 --> 13:51.167
Look, I-I need
to talk to... to Rusty.

13:52.369 --> 13:54.036
Annie wants...

13:56.406 --> 13:58.173
I need to talk to Rusty.

13:58.241 --> 14:00.275
All right.

14:00.376 --> 14:03.345
Why don't we make
a tentative appointment

14:03.412 --> 14:05.446
for you and Rusty to talk

14:05.514 --> 14:08.582
tomorrow at 4:00 P.M.
in the conference room here?

14:10.552 --> 14:12.887
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

14:14.189 --> 14:16.457
Because we can fix this.
We can.

14:18.026 --> 14:22.228
Fixing this is a...
Very big priority here,

14:22.296 --> 14:23.697
as you can see.

14:29.470 --> 14:31.270
See you tomorrow,
Daniel.

14:54.527 --> 14:57.363
You sure you don't want us
to just arrest the bastard?

14:57.431 --> 14:59.366
That's a bell
that can't be unrung.

14:59.433 --> 15:01.067
Let's keep
our options open.

15:01.135 --> 15:03.936
What did we find out
about Judge Cully?

15:04.004 --> 15:06.605
59, married, with three kids.
Long list of commendations.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.340
Been on the state's
appellate bench

15:08.441 --> 15:09.908
for 18 years, ma'am.

15:09.976 --> 15:12.510
And, according
to his active calendar,

15:12.611 --> 15:16.647
he's got another 23 decisions
pending in the next few months.

15:16.715 --> 15:18.382
Any of those drug cases?

15:18.450 --> 15:20.484
Mm, doesn't say.

15:20.552 --> 15:23.654
Why do you ask,
Special Agent Fritz Howard?

15:23.722 --> 15:25.189
Curiosity.

15:25.290 --> 15:28.092
Um, I just googled
Judge Cully's name, Captain.

15:28.160 --> 15:31.161
First thing that comes up is
an article about a pot case...

15:31.229 --> 15:32.963
<i>People vs. William.</i>

15:33.031 --> 15:34.365
Says here, "from the nature
of Judge Cully's questions",

15:34.432 --> 15:35.600
"the decision is expected

15:35.667 --> 15:37.468
"to open the door
for the legalization

15:37.536 --> 15:39.604
"of marijuana cultivation
in California

15:39.672 --> 15:42.039
in defiance
of federal law."

15:42.107 --> 15:44.609
What a coincidence
you should ask about drugs.

15:44.676 --> 15:46.143
Call it a hunch.

15:46.211 --> 15:48.179
Listen, if you let me
take a closer look

15:48.247 --> 15:50.515
at that bullet you recovered
from the crime scene,

15:50.583 --> 15:54.052
I could probably tell you
something... More definitive.

15:59.558 --> 16:02.394
Oh, and hold off
on calling for a DA right now.

16:02.461 --> 16:04.496
U.S. attorney
might want this one.

16:14.508 --> 16:17.010
Excuse me, officers.

16:17.078 --> 16:19.479
I was wondering if you could help
me out with something real quick.

16:19.547 --> 16:21.248
Sorry to bug you.

16:21.316 --> 16:24.585
Some kid just hit my car...
took the mirror right off.

16:24.686 --> 16:28.055
I got his license plate
before he left.

16:28.122 --> 16:29.389
I was hoping
I could just talk to him,

16:29.457 --> 16:30.724
maybe get him
to do the right thing.

16:30.792 --> 16:32.760
I can't afford
another insurance hike.

16:32.827 --> 16:34.428
I mean,
unless you guys want me

16:34.529 --> 16:36.330
to fill out a report...
I can do it.

16:36.398 --> 16:37.731
No, no, no.
It's fine.

16:37.799 --> 16:39.733
Let me, uh...
See what I come up with.

16:39.801 --> 16:41.435
I really appreciate it,
guys.

16:41.536 --> 16:43.570
I literally
<i>just</i> got this car.

16:50.078 --> 16:51.211
It's warm, huh?

16:54.582 --> 16:57.685
Okay.
Got a phone number.

16:59.588 --> 17:00.721
Is that good enough?

17:03.725 --> 17:05.126
Absolutely.

17:05.227 --> 17:06.694
I think I can handle it
from here.

17:06.762 --> 17:08.796
You guys have a good one,
all right? Thank you.

17:24.112 --> 17:25.279
No.

17:25.347 --> 17:26.646
No, no.

17:26.748 --> 17:28.115
I'm fine.

17:29.518 --> 17:32.253
You watching the news?

17:32.320 --> 17:34.388
I know.
Pretty crazy, right?

17:34.456 --> 17:35.790
I'm just glad I caught you

17:35.857 --> 17:38.125
before you went
all the way downtown.

17:38.193 --> 17:39.760
I know.

17:39.828 --> 17:43.063
Listen, that place is gonna
have to be off-limits for now

17:43.131 --> 17:45.165
'cause of the shooting.

17:45.233 --> 17:47.167
Hey, babe,
believe me, okay?

17:47.234 --> 17:48.668
I can't get into everything
right now,

17:48.769 --> 17:52.071
but you're so lucky
you weren't with me today.

17:52.139 --> 17:55.073
No. No, I mean it.

17:55.141 --> 17:56.508
Yeah.
So, I don't know.

17:56.610 --> 17:58.343
I guess we're just gonna have to
find some other place...

18:00.714 --> 18:03.282
Wait, wait, wait.

18:04.485 --> 18:05.519
I'll call you back.

18:14.896 --> 18:16.698
Angel?

18:16.799 --> 18:18.233
Dad.

18:18.300 --> 18:19.668
You scared the crap
out of me.

18:19.735 --> 18:21.803
What are you...
I thought you were on till 6:00.

18:21.871 --> 18:25.207
There was a guy with
a gun in one of the buildings.

18:25.308 --> 18:26.475
He shot someone.

18:26.543 --> 18:28.177
Detectives
started questioning me,

18:28.244 --> 18:29.545
shut down the building.

18:29.646 --> 18:30.879
Loco.

18:30.947 --> 18:33.482
I came home to make sure
my keys were here.

18:36.219 --> 18:38.320
Hopefully, the police
don't check up on us.

18:38.388 --> 18:40.222
They're not gonna be looking
for undocumented workers.

18:40.290 --> 18:41.523
They're gonna be looking
for a killer.

18:43.526 --> 18:46.495
If we were back in Juárez
and I was still police,

18:46.562 --> 18:48.196
I would be looking at <i>us.</i>

18:49.799 --> 18:50.899
You got a shift?

18:50.967 --> 18:52.635
Yeah... till midnight.

18:52.702 --> 18:55.337
Don't worry, pop.
We're okay.

19:28.904 --> 19:30.638
How we doing
on those plates?

19:30.706 --> 19:31.940
We're getting close.

19:32.008 --> 19:33.641
About an hour?

19:33.709 --> 19:37.312
We've been combing the books
for unsolved sniper homicides,

19:37.380 --> 19:38.613
trying to figure out

19:38.681 --> 19:41.483
what our good friend
Special Agent Fritz Howard

19:41.551 --> 19:43.419
was being
so tight-lipped about.

19:43.486 --> 19:45.321
Yeah, and get this...
of the five unsolved

19:45.388 --> 19:47.189
assassination-style murders
we found,

19:47.257 --> 19:49.858
two were prominent figures
in the movement to legalize pot.

19:49.926 --> 19:52.595
Yeah, one was a city council
member from Phoenix,

19:52.662 --> 19:54.430
the other
was a DEA Agent

19:54.497 --> 19:56.731
killed four months ago
outside his house in Santa Fe.

19:56.799 --> 19:58.700
Both guys hit
with body shots

19:58.768 --> 20:01.336
from a 556 match-grade
precision rifle, ma'am.

20:01.404 --> 20:03.838
And that rifle officially
makes this an FBI investigation.

20:03.906 --> 20:05.406
You're kidding me.

20:05.474 --> 20:06.941
Turns out the bullet
from our shooting

20:07.009 --> 20:08.743
came from the same weapon

20:08.810 --> 20:11.545
used in those two other murders
you were talking about.

20:11.613 --> 20:15.283
So this assassination <i>is</i> related
to legalizing marijuana?

20:15.350 --> 20:18.218
Which is the last thing
the cartels want us to do.

20:18.286 --> 20:20.787
So they've hired a pro...
this, uh, ghost.

20:20.855 --> 20:23.223
Don't know his name,
what he looks like.

20:23.290 --> 20:24.791
He never leaves
a trace of himself behind...

20:24.859 --> 20:26.526
or a witness,
for that matter.

20:26.594 --> 20:28.762
In other words, you're
no further along than we are.

20:28.829 --> 20:30.830
Doesn't matter...
the murder of a DEA Agent

20:30.931 --> 20:33.366
means the FBI
has jurisdiction.

20:33.433 --> 20:36.402
We need to wish
Special Agent Howard good luck.

20:36.470 --> 20:37.603
Thank you, chief.

20:37.671 --> 20:39.572
Sorry, guys.
I appreciate all your help.

20:39.640 --> 20:41.807
I'll be back in touch.

20:41.875 --> 20:46.912
The FBI has the mandate
and the resources for this.

20:46.980 --> 20:48.747
It's better on <i>their</i> dime
than ours.

20:48.815 --> 20:49.848
Understood.

20:51.618 --> 20:53.352
Thank you, chief.

20:57.390 --> 20:59.424
Of course, we still have
a legal obligation

20:59.492 --> 21:01.626
to search for and determine

21:01.693 --> 21:04.996
the identity
of our possible witness.

21:08.367 --> 21:10.801
And our assassin...

21:10.869 --> 21:13.637
Is probably looking
for that witness, too.

21:14.973 --> 21:16.674
Good assumption.

21:17.776 --> 21:21.578
But before we pass
that suggestion on to the FBI,

21:21.646 --> 21:23.414
I'd like to be certain
of all our facts.

21:23.481 --> 21:26.016
We wouldn't want to send
the federal government

21:26.084 --> 21:29.019
on a wild-goose chase,
now, would we, Lieutenant?

21:29.087 --> 21:31.321
Oh, I should hope not,
Captain.

21:31.389 --> 21:35.092
I should certainly
hope not.

21:43.586 --> 21:45.458
So, Daniel came today,
like you said he would, huh?

21:46.837 --> 21:47.473
Yes.

21:48.337 --> 21:49.854
He wants to apologize.

21:50.925 --> 21:52.292
Sure he does.

21:53.114 --> 21:55.027
So, not returning his calls
was the right thing to do?

21:55.095 --> 21:56.629
Oh, yeah.

21:57.092 --> 21:58.697
I wouldn't have been able
to record him

21:58.765 --> 22:00.832
in a phone conversation
without a warrant.

22:01.153 --> 22:03.635
But his apology
could work perfectly

22:03.703 --> 22:05.870
as a spontaneous
confession.

22:06.485 --> 22:08.005
So, I don't have to
see him again, right?

22:08.073 --> 22:10.141
Because I really
don't want to.

22:10.208 --> 22:12.610
It'll be uncomfortable
for a few minutes,

22:14.115 --> 22:17.360
but then you have a chance
to solve this problem forever.

22:17.719 --> 22:19.316
Are you sure
about all this?

22:19.384 --> 22:21.852
Honey, I do this
for a living.

22:24.632 --> 22:25.432
Right.

22:26.246 --> 22:28.359
Rusty,
if you change your mind,

22:28.969 --> 22:30.027
we can still arrest him.

22:30.550 --> 22:32.329
Otherwise,
4:00 tomorrow,

22:32.397 --> 22:35.398
two minutes...
you're done.

22:36.730 --> 22:37.934
Captain,
I'm sorry to interrupt,

22:38.002 --> 22:40.236
but we just got enough of the
plate on the Phoenix to run it,

22:40.304 --> 22:41.801
and we have a problem.

22:47.719 --> 22:49.078
We pulled the registration
on the Pontiac

22:49.145 --> 22:50.813
and sent a patrol car
to pick up our witness.

22:50.880 --> 22:52.648
Thing is, he doesn't live
at that address.

22:52.716 --> 22:54.316
Exactly.

22:54.384 --> 22:56.050
The officer just called, said
the woman who does live there

22:56.118 --> 22:57.752
sold the Pontiac
a couple of weeks ago,

22:57.820 --> 22:59.320
and she gave him an address
for the buyer, ma'am.

22:59.388 --> 23:00.955
On which
I ran a utility check,

23:01.023 --> 23:02.256
and the guy
paying the water bill

23:02.324 --> 23:04.643
where the car went
is one Gustavo Reyes.

23:05.100 --> 23:06.861
Why do I know
that name?

23:06.928 --> 23:08.429
Mr. Reyes
is the handyman

23:08.497 --> 23:10.903
at the apartment building
this morning.

23:11.366 --> 23:12.666
What else?

23:12.734 --> 23:14.169
The woman
at that first address...

23:14.236 --> 23:16.071
the one who sold the car...
she told the officers

23:16.139 --> 23:18.774
that someone else had
just called about the Pontiac.

23:18.842 --> 23:20.109
That could be
our shooter.

23:20.177 --> 23:22.011
And he's ahead of us.

23:24.982 --> 23:25.982
Just a second.

23:31.356 --> 23:32.889
Can I help you?

23:32.990 --> 23:35.058
Uh, I'm sorry
to bother you at home.

23:35.159 --> 23:36.760
My name's Dave.

23:36.827 --> 23:39.696
My daughter, she's friends
with... with your son.

23:39.764 --> 23:40.764
Angel?

23:40.831 --> 23:42.065
Angel.

23:42.133 --> 23:43.767
He sounds like a great kid.

23:43.835 --> 23:45.069
Is he around?

23:45.170 --> 23:46.971
Angel just left for work
a little while ago.

23:47.039 --> 23:48.740
Is there a problem?

23:48.808 --> 23:50.208
No, there's no problem.

23:50.276 --> 23:53.411
Actually, uh,
this is a little weird, but...

23:53.512 --> 23:56.148
She wrote a note for him,
and she asked me to deliver it.

23:56.215 --> 23:57.816
Okay.

23:57.884 --> 23:59.985
Leave it with me.
He'll see it when he gets home.

24:01.288 --> 24:03.422
Look...
I-I'll level with you.

24:04.791 --> 24:06.025
My daughter's only 17.

24:06.093 --> 24:08.360
I-I would really
just like to meet him.

24:09.463 --> 24:11.431
Could you tell me
where he works?

24:13.934 --> 24:15.468
Where did she meet angel,
again?

24:15.536 --> 24:17.837
Oh, I think
it was at a party.

24:17.905 --> 24:19.406
Huh.

24:19.474 --> 24:21.909
'Cause angel
already has a girlfriend.

24:21.976 --> 24:25.780
Maybe it's better you leave
this note with me and I'll...

24:25.881 --> 24:28.282
hey, what are you doing?!
What the hell?!

24:28.350 --> 24:29.917
Are you crazy
or something?!

24:29.985 --> 24:31.352
What's wrong
with you?!

24:40.263 --> 24:42.297
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

25:52.403 --> 25:54.037
We got a body!

25:55.940 --> 25:58.108
Oh, damn it.

26:04.917 --> 26:06.451
Smell the smoke?

26:06.519 --> 26:08.887
We didn't miss our killer
by much.

26:10.223 --> 26:11.490
All clear!

26:11.558 --> 26:13.326
Back here, captain.
Back here.

26:20.534 --> 26:24.337
Must have been Gustavo's son
in the apartment this morning.

26:25.406 --> 26:26.406
His name is Angel.

26:26.474 --> 26:28.107
Why didn't he call us?

26:28.175 --> 26:30.109
Maybe the boy wasn't supposed to
be the building.

26:30.177 --> 26:32.946
Maybe he's not supposed to be
in the United States.

26:33.014 --> 26:35.382
The Pontiac sale
wasn't transferred properly.

26:35.449 --> 26:37.117
There's no insurance
on it.

26:37.185 --> 26:39.487
Gustavo and his son
are probably both undocumented.

26:40.958 --> 26:42.523
So the killer shows up
looking for Angel.

26:42.590 --> 26:43.657
Angel isn't here.

26:43.725 --> 26:45.996
Dad won't help.
Bang.

26:49.198 --> 26:51.500
He searched the room,
but he didn't toss it all.

26:51.567 --> 26:53.469
Maybe he found what he was
looking for, Captain.

26:53.536 --> 26:56.505
Then maybe he already knows
where the kid is.

27:00.235 --> 27:01.610
Apron.
He works in a restaurant.

27:01.678 --> 27:03.679
If we're going to save
this boy's life,

27:03.747 --> 27:05.811
we need to find him,
and now.

27:52.300 --> 27:54.301
The kid is safe
and working his shift, Captain.

27:54.369 --> 27:56.302
The staff doesn't know
we're here, but we've managed

27:56.404 --> 27:58.204
to replace all the customers
with our people,

27:58.272 --> 28:00.107
and we have more coming in,
as you requested.

28:00.175 --> 28:01.508
Has the FBI arrived yet?

28:01.576 --> 28:03.443
Yes, and they're
a little anxious.

28:03.511 --> 28:05.979
We're next in the valet line,
Lieutenant.

28:06.047 --> 28:07.314
Roger that, Chief.
See you inside.

28:07.382 --> 28:09.316
We didn't need
the feds.

28:09.384 --> 28:12.419
I told you once we confirmed
we had a witness,

28:12.487 --> 28:14.354
we'd share it
with the FBI.

28:14.422 --> 28:16.357
I thought you were just
covering your ass

28:16.424 --> 28:18.059
so we could
keep our case.

28:18.126 --> 28:20.428
I was precisely
following the law.

28:20.495 --> 28:24.199
God. It's like working for
a hall monitor every single day.

28:30.572 --> 28:34.141
Detective, anyone, uh, ask you
to keep their car idling

28:34.209 --> 28:35.509
while they went in?

28:35.610 --> 28:37.945
Uh, no, ma'am. Our killer
won't want more witnesses.

28:38.012 --> 28:39.513
But he's probably
nesting somewhere,

28:39.614 --> 28:41.248
waiting to take the boy
outside.

28:41.316 --> 28:42.982
I forgot your ticket. Mm-hmm.

28:43.050 --> 28:45.051
From anywhere above 20 feet,
facing South,

28:45.119 --> 28:48.955
the sniper has a great
line of sight on the Phoenix.

28:49.624 --> 28:51.325
The driver's seat
is the one place

28:51.392 --> 28:53.360
he knows
Angel is going to be.

28:53.428 --> 28:54.528
Stay safe.

28:54.629 --> 28:56.197
Yes, ma'am.

28:59.635 --> 29:01.469
The things I do
for this job.

29:15.318 --> 29:17.186
Gentlemen,
what's the latest?

29:17.253 --> 29:19.988
Had a helicopter fly over
about 10 minutes ago.

29:20.056 --> 29:21.590
Pilot didn't see
anything.

29:21.657 --> 29:23.191
Thought a second pass
would be too risky.

29:24.260 --> 29:27.596
Okay, here we are,
and if Sanchez is right,

29:27.664 --> 29:29.598
this whole area
is the kill zone.

29:29.666 --> 29:31.233
It's pretty huge.

29:31.301 --> 29:33.135
Captain Raydor, Lieutenant,
this is Agent Goodwin.

29:33.203 --> 29:34.537
Thanks for bringing us
in on this.

29:34.605 --> 29:36.372
Oh,
this is <i>your</i> case.

29:36.440 --> 29:38.085
Always nice when the LAPD
recognizes our jurisdiction.

29:39.030 --> 29:41.900
As far as the kill zone
Lieutenant Flynn was mentioning,

29:42.280 --> 29:44.782
we got two teams
slow-walking the area,

29:44.850 --> 29:47.218
agents in a van out back
monitoring the rooftops.

29:47.285 --> 29:49.053
The problem is,
there is a limit

29:49.121 --> 29:50.888
to how late
we can keep this place open

29:50.956 --> 29:52.189
without him catching on.

29:52.257 --> 29:54.191
If we start
actively searching for him...

29:54.259 --> 29:57.161
Then he'll try and get away.
Thank you.

29:57.229 --> 30:00.698
Let me be clear about this.
The FBI needs this guy alive.

30:00.765 --> 30:02.233
He's a transnational
threat

30:02.300 --> 30:04.935
operating under the direction
of the Maldova Cartel.

30:05.003 --> 30:06.770
If we can get him
to name his paymaster,

30:06.838 --> 30:08.205
maybe turn him
against his employers...

30:08.272 --> 30:10.173
That would be huge,
Captain.

30:10.241 --> 30:11.675
Huge.

30:11.742 --> 30:13.009
Where's
our runaway witness?

30:14.144 --> 30:16.746
He's right over
there.

30:19.850 --> 30:21.351
Hello, Angel.

30:22.520 --> 30:24.254
We need to talk.

30:24.321 --> 30:26.456
You saw something
this morning

30:26.523 --> 30:28.991
at the apartment in the building
where your father works.

30:29.059 --> 30:31.027
You talked to my dad?

30:31.095 --> 30:32.729
You told him
I was in that apartment...

30:32.796 --> 30:33.796
that's how you knew
I was here?

30:40.438 --> 30:42.972
Dad must be
freaking out.

30:43.040 --> 30:46.442
Look, you can't just send him
back to Mexico. You can't.

30:48.212 --> 30:49.479
Angel, you...

30:51.949 --> 30:54.951
your father isn't going to be
mad at you at all.

30:56.019 --> 30:58.020
And he isn't
going to be deported.

30:58.088 --> 31:01.390
In fact, if we could have
brought your dad with us,

31:01.458 --> 31:04.259
I know that he would want you
to tell us what happened today.

31:04.327 --> 31:05.427
We don't have much time,
angel.

31:05.495 --> 31:07.996
If we don't catch this guy
tonight,

31:08.063 --> 31:10.298
you could be at risk
for a very long time.

31:10.366 --> 31:12.800
Why don't you start
by telling us

31:12.868 --> 31:14.803
why you were
at the apartment building

31:14.870 --> 31:15.804
to begin with?

31:15.872 --> 31:18.140
Uh...

31:18.208 --> 31:20.142
The salespeople
don't show it on mondays.

31:20.210 --> 31:23.913
I was planning
on meeting my girlfriend there.

31:23.980 --> 31:26.082
I went there early
to get the place ready.

31:27.484 --> 31:30.186
There was this guy there...
this weird guy.

31:30.254 --> 31:31.788
I've never seen him before.

31:31.855 --> 31:34.157
So I said, "who are you?"

31:34.225 --> 31:35.892
And while
he was answering,

31:35.960 --> 31:37.794
he took this gun out
and he shot at me,

31:37.862 --> 31:39.496
so I just started running
as fast as I could.

31:39.564 --> 31:41.132
Why didn't you come
to the police?

31:41.199 --> 31:43.968
I didn't want my dad to know
what I was doing.

31:44.036 --> 31:48.440
Plus, I call you guys,
tell you what I saw,

31:48.508 --> 31:50.075
you start
looking into us...

31:50.143 --> 31:52.378
We can't go back to Mexico.

31:52.445 --> 31:55.882
My dad was a police officer
in Juárez.

31:55.950 --> 31:57.417
They, um...

31:58.852 --> 32:00.252
They murdered my mom
and my brothers.

32:01.321 --> 32:04.457
My dad...
he gave up <i>everything</i>

32:04.524 --> 32:06.392
to bring me here
and keep me safe.

32:07.628 --> 32:09.362
Everything.

32:09.430 --> 32:12.799
Angel, nobody's going back
to Mexico.

32:14.368 --> 32:17.370
What we need you to do now...
as best you can...

32:17.438 --> 32:20.373
is tell us what the guy
who shot at you looked like.

32:20.441 --> 32:22.876
Um...

32:25.079 --> 32:26.946
Dark hair...
Brown eyes...

32:27.014 --> 32:29.349
About 6 feet...
Maybe 190 pounds...

32:29.417 --> 32:32.519
Gray t-shirt...
Dark jeans.

32:32.587 --> 32:34.154
What else?

32:34.222 --> 32:35.889
He sounded American.

32:35.957 --> 32:37.892
Oh.

32:37.959 --> 32:39.527
He had this...

32:39.594 --> 32:42.030
this big black bag
over his shoulder.

32:43.366 --> 32:45.367
Looked heavy.

32:45.435 --> 32:48.103
Very impressive description,
kid.

32:48.170 --> 32:49.404
Yes.

32:49.472 --> 32:51.873
The killer has good reason
to be here.

32:55.111 --> 32:57.379
How much personnel do you want
in the restaurant, Captain?

32:57.446 --> 32:58.880
Parking lot's
almost full.

32:58.948 --> 33:01.116
We're running out of time.

33:01.184 --> 33:03.251
And the search
isn't getting very far.

33:03.319 --> 33:05.153
Lieutenant Flynn,
are you absolutely sure

33:05.221 --> 33:07.022
there's no more room
in the parking lot?

33:07.090 --> 33:09.224
Yeah, and we still have cars
lined up at the valet.

33:09.292 --> 33:11.627
Since our search for the killer
seems to be failing,

33:11.694 --> 33:13.361
it's time
to implement plan "B."

33:13.429 --> 33:14.596
There's a plan "B"?

33:14.663 --> 33:16.331
We're gonna
start collecting car keys

33:16.399 --> 33:17.899
from all
the restaurant staff.

33:17.967 --> 33:19.301
Detectives
Sykes and Sanchez

33:19.369 --> 33:21.403
are gonna start moving
their vehicles out of the lot

33:21.471 --> 33:23.573
to make room
for new arrivals.

33:23.640 --> 33:25.408
Lieutenant,
may I see the map?

33:25.476 --> 33:27.009
Since we are all agreed

33:27.077 --> 33:30.546
that the killer's best shot
is at angel's car,

33:30.614 --> 33:33.081
let's move it somewhere
harder for him to see.

33:37.253 --> 33:39.521
I'm gonna take a break.

34:59.729 --> 35:01.263
Bye, angel.
Have a good night.

35:01.331 --> 35:03.198
See you tomorrow.

35:23.116 --> 35:25.183
Freeze! Drop your weapon!
Drop it!

35:25.751 --> 35:27.718
Put the gun down!
Put it down!

35:28.686 --> 35:29.619
Get on the ground now!

35:29.720 --> 35:32.055
Drop it. Now.

35:34.791 --> 35:36.124
Put your gun down!

35:36.226 --> 35:38.393
Listen to me!
Put your gun down!

35:38.461 --> 35:40.094
Put it down,
or we will kill you!

35:40.162 --> 35:41.562
Put it down!

36:05.085 --> 36:06.152
You all right?

36:08.188 --> 36:10.122
That was a close one.

36:10.190 --> 36:11.323
Good job,
Agent Goodwin.

36:11.424 --> 36:13.225
Call this in!

36:13.293 --> 36:15.428
Roll the paramedics now!

36:17.197 --> 36:19.398
Sir, I'm afraid
medical attention

36:19.466 --> 36:21.667
will not be reaching you
in time.

36:21.735 --> 36:25.404
Could I have a name to put
on your death certificate?

36:38.752 --> 36:40.186
Who the hell is this guy?

36:52.268 --> 36:55.089
So, where are we
on our mystery shooter. Today?

36:55.214 --> 36:56.878
That's the FBI's problem now.

36:57.003 --> 36:58.570
I'm taking personal charge
of this case,

36:58.638 --> 37:00.705
along with your witness,
angel,

37:00.773 --> 37:02.307
who's going under
federal protection.

37:02.375 --> 37:05.578
The truth is,
we may <i>never</i> ID this guy.

37:05.645 --> 37:07.313
I have confidence we'll
eventually figure this one out.

37:07.381 --> 37:10.851
I certainly hope so,
because whoever this man was,

37:10.918 --> 37:12.519
there are more like him
out there.

37:18.459 --> 37:20.560
This way, please,
Daniel.

37:20.628 --> 37:23.697
You know, it's a shame we're not
sitting down making a deal today.

37:23.765 --> 37:27.334
Oh, looks like there's still
a little... Negotiating to do.

37:27.401 --> 37:28.468
Hmm.

37:31.406 --> 37:34.208
Daniel, if, uh,
you'd join us right here.

37:34.275 --> 37:35.409
Thank you.

37:36.778 --> 37:38.712
Oh, well, uh...

37:38.780 --> 37:41.416
I was hoping that,
uh...

37:43.018 --> 37:44.653
I'd like to talk to Rusty
by myself.

37:44.720 --> 37:47.223
The people here want to be sure
of my safety, Daniel.

37:49.392 --> 37:51.793
Okay. I get it.

37:51.861 --> 37:53.295
And I'm sorry.

37:53.363 --> 37:55.631
I am so very sorry.

37:55.699 --> 37:56.832
And I want to promise you,
Rusty,

37:56.900 --> 37:58.367
and everyone else here,

37:58.435 --> 38:00.235
I will <i>never</i> hit you
like that again.

38:00.336 --> 38:01.670
Like this, you mean?

38:01.738 --> 38:04.372
This first set of pictures
is what Rusty looked like

38:04.440 --> 38:06.541
when he came home
the night you beat him.

38:06.609 --> 38:08.309
And the second set

38:08.377 --> 38:10.478
is what he looked like
the day after.

38:15.517 --> 38:18.019
I had no idea
that this was...

38:18.087 --> 38:19.588
Rusty, I don't know
what I need to do

38:19.689 --> 38:20.722
to try and make this okay,
but I want to try.

38:20.789 --> 38:22.457
Annie wants to try.

38:22.525 --> 38:24.359
I apologized.
Tell me what else I can do.

38:24.427 --> 38:26.294
Well, if you want to prove
that you're sorry,

38:26.362 --> 38:27.662
then you can sign
this paper

38:27.730 --> 38:29.430
surrendering
your parental rights

38:29.498 --> 38:31.265
and allow me
to become a ward of the state.

38:31.333 --> 38:32.967
Wait a se... hold on, Rusty.
Wait. W-w-w-wait.

38:33.035 --> 38:34.735
Annie wants to add you
to our family.

38:34.803 --> 38:37.538
I don't think
you understand, Daniel.

38:37.606 --> 38:40.875
We're trying very hard
to avoid arresting you.

38:43.011 --> 38:44.378
Arresting me?

38:44.446 --> 38:45.780
For what?

38:45.848 --> 38:47.915
For child abuse.

38:47.983 --> 38:50.918
To which you confessed yesterday
in my office.

38:50.986 --> 38:55.055
And that you should have to ask
why we would arrest you

38:55.123 --> 38:57.591
after seeing
those pictures...

38:57.659 --> 39:00.628
It's just a very bad sign,
Danny boy.

39:01.764 --> 39:04.499
Look, we put you
in front of a judge...

39:04.566 --> 39:06.734
That's assault and battery
of a minor.

39:06.802 --> 39:08.870
That will trigger investigations
with any other children

39:08.937 --> 39:10.738
who might be
under your supervision.

39:10.806 --> 39:12.774
Like
your fiancée's daughters.

39:12.841 --> 39:14.642
On the other hand,
your booking photo

39:14.710 --> 39:16.912
might make a nice addition
to your wedding album.

39:16.979 --> 39:18.580
Hold on! Hold on!
Y...

39:20.550 --> 39:22.651
I admit
that I made a mistake.

39:24.989 --> 39:27.457
But...

39:27.524 --> 39:28.958
I did my best.

39:29.026 --> 39:30.393
Unfortunately, Daniel,

39:30.461 --> 39:33.429
your very best
turns out to be a crime.

39:35.399 --> 39:36.799
You...

39:36.867 --> 39:38.501
You don't understand.

39:38.602 --> 39:41.671
If I tell Annie that
I signed away my responsibility

39:41.739 --> 39:43.440
for my own son...

39:43.508 --> 39:45.976
There are two choices
in front of you.

39:46.043 --> 39:49.880
They are both very clear
and easy to understand.

39:51.049 --> 39:53.083
Sign this document,

39:53.151 --> 39:56.687
surrender your parental rights
over Rusty,

39:56.755 --> 39:59.690
or prepare to be arrested
and arraigned for trial.

40:01.059 --> 40:03.760
If it's any comfort to you,
Daniel,

40:03.828 --> 40:05.929
yesterday, I was reminded
just how much

40:05.997 --> 40:09.033
good fathers are willing
to sacrifice for their children.

40:09.100 --> 40:11.735
You're not cut out
for the job.

40:34.078 --> 40:35.921
You may just have
ruined my life.

40:40.209 --> 40:41.089
Good.

40:58.520 --> 40:59.820
Congratulations, kid.

40:59.888 --> 41:03.724
We should all sign on
as witnesses.

41:03.792 --> 41:07.094
Now, this is the best deal
we've done so far.

41:07.161 --> 41:10.730
Guys, Sharon,
thank you so much.

41:10.797 --> 41:12.064
Thank you.

41:13.867 --> 41:16.602
How weird is it
that I'm happy to be an orphan?

41:17.737 --> 41:19.872
You're not an orphan,
Rusty.

41:19.940 --> 41:21.841
You may not have
a mom and dad,

41:21.909 --> 41:24.210
but you are family.

41:24.277 --> 41:25.912
You are.
