Looks great, Rick.

Rick?

00:55.455 --> 00:57.252
Barry,
can you hear me out there?

00:57.323 --> 00:58.722
Yeah, lock up the street.
I'm coming out.

01:31.391 --> 01:33.018
child molester...

01:33.093 --> 01:35.891
and one of his victims,
Scott Fisher.

01:46.439 --> 01:50.876
Four years ago,
Dr. Joseph Vinton,
a therapist...

01:51.177 --> 01:54.203
recognized for his treatment
of disturbed children...

01:54.280 --> 01:55.941
took Scott Fisher...

01:56.015 --> 01:59.246
then 11 years old,
to this restaurant.

02:02.922 --> 02:04.651
[People applauding]

02:09.329 --> 02:12.127
Now, Dr. Vinton sat here
with Scott...

02:12.265 --> 02:13.698
he bought him ice cream...

02:13.766 --> 02:18.601
and he convinced Scott
not to say anything about the
abuse that he'd committed...

02:18.671 --> 02:21.731
moments earlier at
his Greenwich Village office.

02:21.808 --> 02:24.276
But eventually,
Scott did tell his mother...

02:24.344 --> 02:26.574
and Dr. Vinton went to prison.

02:27.213 --> 02:28.578
Dr. Vinton.

02:28.781 --> 02:32.148
It must be strange for you
coming back to this place.

02:32.585 --> 02:36.043
I'm not concerned
about myself.
I'm here to help others.

02:36.656 --> 02:40.888
I've committed
unspeakable crimes, and while
I've served my time in jail...

02:40.960 --> 02:42.621
I know it's not enough.

02:42.695 --> 02:46.096
Eighteen months for the abuse
of seven children.

02:46.199 --> 02:47.427
Sounds like a cruise.

02:47.500 --> 02:48.762
Is that justice?

02:48.902 --> 02:51.097
I don't know what justice is.

02:51.237 --> 02:53.364
I know what I did was awful.
I hurt people.

02:53.439 --> 02:55.464
I can't ever live it down.

02:55.642 --> 02:57.974
Not in 18 months,
or in 18 years.

02:58.044 --> 03:01.207
Now, you wrote a book
in prison
about your experiences.

03:01.314 --> 03:04.408
Who would you think
would want to read it?
Certainly not my audience!

03:04.484 --> 03:06.008
[People booing]

03:09.088 --> 03:11.716
I didn't face what I'd done
until I was in prison.

03:11.791 --> 03:15.955
The book is
part of my recovery. Part of
the reason I'm free today...

03:16.296 --> 03:17.558
to say...

03:18.064 --> 03:19.395
I'm sorry.

03:20.066 --> 03:22.762
To say he's sorry
to two of his victims...

03:22.835 --> 03:25.531
Scott Fisher,
and his mother Sarah.

03:25.738 --> 03:26.796
Now, Scott...

03:26.873 --> 03:30.934
this man took you
into his care
and he abused you.

03:31.978 --> 03:33.639
(Mason)
He's willing
to acknowledge that.

03:33.713 --> 03:35.044
But if I were you...

03:35.114 --> 03:37.810
I think I would
still be a little angry.

03:37.951 --> 03:39.350
I am, but...

03:40.453 --> 03:42.717
I'm hoping to...

03:42.789 --> 03:44.313
make a start...

04:50.490 --> 04:53.015
I was on air, I didn't see
the father come in.

04:53.092 --> 04:55.754
You knew who he was?
I wanted him on the show.

04:55.828 --> 04:58.160
The wife says he's there,
she's not.

04:58.231 --> 05:00.961
Who dreams he's going
to show up and shoot Vinton?

05:01.034 --> 05:02.524
Vinton gonna make it?

05:02.602 --> 05:04.092

05:11.711 --> 05:13.144
four million witnesses.

05:13.212 --> 05:16.181
Did the father know
the psychiatrist was going
to be here today?

05:16.249 --> 05:18.080
[Siren wailing]
No way.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.346
We're on location every week.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.481
We never announce
where we're going to be.

05:22.555 --> 05:24.182
That's what I do.

05:25.258 --> 05:28.193
My guests are in a hotel
two days before air.

05:28.628 --> 05:32.894

<i>[Woman chattering

05:36.436 --> 05:38.495

Look, if there's
nothing else...

05:40.807 --> 05:42.331
can I take care
of my staff?

05:42.408 --> 05:45.309
Let me give you my card.
You remember anything else
give me a call.

05:45.878 --> 05:48.676
Why did he do it?
Because he's crazy,
that's why.

05:48.748 --> 05:50.943
You thought your husband
was capable of violence?

05:51.017 --> 05:54.384
It's my fault. He blames me
for what happened to Scotty.

05:54.454 --> 05:55.853
He blames me for everything.

05:55.922 --> 05:59.881
I don't talk to my husband.
I haven't seen him
in three years.

06:00.126 --> 06:01.753
So, you didn't expect him
here today?

06:01.828 --> 06:03.819
Well, he attacked Vinton
at his trial.

06:03.896 --> 06:05.363
He got thrown out of the Army.

06:05.431 --> 06:06.989
Why do you think
I divorced him?

06:07.066 --> 06:08.499
Is my dad going to be okay?

06:08.568 --> 06:09.967
(Briscoe)
The wound's not serious.

06:10.036 --> 06:13.403
Officer O'Brien is going to
take you home, all right?

06:15.675 --> 06:17.768
Where is that
security director Talbott?

06:17.844 --> 06:20.540
I sent him back
to the precinct.
We'll get his statement.

06:20.613 --> 06:23.104
What? He's an ex-cop.
He did his job.

06:23.182 --> 06:24.945
You want to book him
for shooting the father?

06:25.017 --> 06:26.450
If you don't mind,
I've got a question.

06:26.519 --> 06:28.783
How'd the father know
to come here today?

06:28.855 --> 06:31.653
Come on, Mike, break it up,
move along.
Nothing to see here.

06:31.724 --> 06:35.353
Secret location,
lots of security.
How did Fisher get here?

06:35.595 --> 06:37.756
He shot the guy
who molested his kid.

06:37.830 --> 06:39.923
I don't care
if an avenging angel sent him.

06:39.999 --> 06:41.796
I might've done the same thing
if it was my kid.

06:41.868 --> 06:42.926
Oh, I guess, case closed.

06:43.002 --> 06:44.993
That's what Van Buren
will say.

06:46.172 --> 06:47.833
How did the father
get there?

06:47.907 --> 06:49.067
Who cares?

06:49.142 --> 06:51.804
In Narcotics,
we didn't care when
scum dealers got shot...

06:51.878 --> 06:53.903
we did want to find out
who shot them.

06:53.980 --> 06:57.074
We have the killer
in an operating room
at Bellevue.

06:57.150 --> 06:58.981
Just tell me
how Fisher got there.

06:59.051 --> 07:01.349
We drop it and he does
his 25 years.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.912
What did the wife say?
He was in the Army...

07:03.990 --> 07:05.958
in the Rangers in Vietnam?

07:06.025 --> 07:07.993
Those guys
can track a leopard
in the rain...

07:08.060 --> 07:09.652
so, maybe
he stalked the shrink.

07:09.729 --> 07:11.754
(Logan)
A shrink child molester.

07:11.831 --> 07:13.298
I wonder what's next
on his show...

07:13.366 --> 07:14.993
family dog gets a sex change?

07:15.067 --> 07:17.092
Or girl gives birth
to a baby pig.

07:17.170 --> 07:20.867
My mother likes those shows,
along with
the rest of America.

07:21.474 --> 07:22.941
What do you want to do?

07:23.009 --> 07:25.876
Hey, we already have
four open homicides.

07:26.112 --> 07:29.570
Now, wait a minute.
If he stalked him, he could
have hit him in an alleyway...

07:29.649 --> 07:31.276
he could have hit him
driving a car.

07:31.350 --> 07:34.012
He picks today
when four million people
are watching...

07:34.086 --> 07:36.020
in a place he's not even
supposed to know about?

07:36.088 --> 07:37.521
I'm just saying
let's give it a day.

07:37.590 --> 07:40.423
If nothing happens,
the case closes itself.

07:41.427 --> 07:43.452
Talbott,
Masors head of security...

07:43.529 --> 07:46.293
the one who shot the father,
we've got him upstairs. So?

07:46.365 --> 07:47.764
Bring him down.

07:48.468 --> 07:51.801
I don't know how he got there.
At least I zipped him.

07:51.871 --> 07:54.431
God knows
who he would have shot next.

07:54.507 --> 07:56.975
You'd think someone
would have noticed him
at the restaurant.

07:57.043 --> 07:59.375
They were
rounding up audience
off the street.

07:59.445 --> 08:01.504
I wish I'd seen him sooner,
but, hey...

08:01.581 --> 08:02.775
it was a crowd.

08:02.849 --> 08:04.441
You'd already met the father?

08:04.517 --> 08:06.542
Saw his picture in a file.

08:06.886 --> 08:08.410
Hey, hold on...

08:08.688 --> 08:12.818
Twenty years in the 31, I
know the drill. Now, am I here
to give a statement or what?

08:12.892 --> 08:14.792
Easy, Barry.
Nobody's blaming you.

08:14.861 --> 08:16.886
But the wife said
her husband was a wacko.

08:16.963 --> 08:18.260

08:18.331 --> 08:20.196

myself...</i>

08:20.266 --> 08:22.791
Yeah, I knew he was a nut,
but a gun?

08:23.870 --> 08:25.997
You're sure Mrs. Fisher
didn't know
where the show was?

08:26.072 --> 08:27.767
Unless she reads minds.

08:27.840 --> 08:30.707
She don't find out
until we drive her there.

08:30.776 --> 08:34.506

Finish typing up
this statement.

Oh, sure.

Retired cop.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.279
What?

08:44.155 --> 08:47.785
He knows Fisher
was in the Army,
has a history of violence.

08:48.127 --> 08:50.823
What? He's surprised the guy
shows up with a gun?

08:50.897 --> 08:53.491
Well, I thought you said
we had four open homicides.

08:53.566 --> 08:56.865
The bodies are frozen.
They're not
going to thaw out.

08:57.770 --> 08:59.738
Okay, let's call the D.A.

08:59.805 --> 09:03.172
Maybe we get in to see
Pop Fisher. He sure as hell
knows how he got there.

09:03.242 --> 09:07.178
Yeah, he's in post-op,
sedated. They won't put him
in his room till the morning.

Listen up,
no jury puts me in jail
for what I did.

09:27.066 --> 09:29.000
Sid, you listen.
It's a question
of for how long.

09:29.068 --> 09:30.160

All right, look, we can do
this the easy way, or we can
do this the hard way.

09:40.379 --> 09:43.576
But you know the name
of the head of his security.

09:44.150 --> 09:46.550
Hell, yeah, I know his name.
He put a hole in my shoulder.

isn't getting anywhere.

this would happen, obviously

you'd been through...

09:57.196 --> 10:00.029
some people would wonder
why you went on TV at all.

10:00.099 --> 10:04.331
I thought we could help
others. I thought
it would be good for Scotty.

10:04.937 --> 10:07.337
We'd have an ending,
a resolution.

to the detectives alone.

10:44.076 --> 10:47.375
You see how upset he is?
We're victims of this, too.

10:48.214 --> 10:52.548
My husband's temper destroyed
my son and my marriage.
I didn't tell him.

10:52.618 --> 10:55.018
I didn't know
where we were going.

10:56.922 --> 10:58.913
He can't remember
how he found Vinton.

10:58.991 --> 11:00.982
Must be trauma
from the wound.

11:01.060 --> 11:02.960
Had to be his wife.
She got to him.

11:03.029 --> 11:05.520
Mrs. Fisher's lying?
Come on,
she hates her husband.

11:05.598 --> 11:07.828
She doesn't have to like him
to wind him up.

11:07.900 --> 11:09.333
Yeah, but she
wouldn't want him there.

11:09.402 --> 11:11.029
She'd be afraid
he'd shoot her.

11:11.103 --> 11:14.561
"The killing of Dr. Vinton
comes at the start
of the television period...

11:14.640 --> 11:19.236
<i>"known as sweeps. Ratings of
Rick Masors Final Confession
are expected to rise...</i>

11:19.311 --> 11:23.145
30% in the top 25 markets."

11:23.416 --> 11:25.748
Oh, Mason did it
for the ratings.

11:25.851 --> 11:29.582
He's a saint, and his show
caters to the highest
instincts of human nature.

11:29.655 --> 11:30.781
Look at him, he's scum.

11:30.856 --> 11:32.255
So, change the channel.

11:32.324 --> 11:35.555
Are you listening to yourself?
First Pop, then Mom,
now Mason.

11:35.628 --> 11:37.323
It's an Oliver Stone movie.

11:37.396 --> 11:38.920
All right, nobody planned it.

11:38.998 --> 11:43.162
It still doesn't answer
my question. How did Fisher
know where to go?

11:43.602 --> 11:45.695
That security chief, Talbott?

11:45.771 --> 11:49.070
He had the mother and son
in a hotel for two days.

11:52.912 --> 11:54.675
Fifth floor. Adjoining suites.

11:54.747 --> 11:56.942
Mrs. Fisher and the boy.
Very private.

11:57.049 --> 11:58.914
So, if we called
we couldn't get through.

11:58.984 --> 12:00.815
Discretion is our middle name.

12:00.886 --> 12:05.016
No, Mr. Masors guests
and Mr. Talbott
werert even on the computer.

12:05.124 --> 12:06.489
Here we go.

12:07.026 --> 12:10.393
The Fishers, no phone calls.
Talbott, local only.

12:11.697 --> 12:14.097
All to the same number.
Masors office.

12:14.166 --> 12:15.827
Was Mr. Mason here
Tuesday night?

12:15.901 --> 12:17.766
He came in about 5:00.

12:18.003 --> 12:20.471
I took him up myself
in the service elevator.

12:20.539 --> 12:23.372
Mr. M. Hates the lobby.
Samsonite tourists.

12:23.476 --> 12:25.205
He left about 7:00.

12:25.377 --> 12:28.403
Are there any pay phones
upstairs?
On the residential floors?

12:28.481 --> 12:30.506
If they use pay phones,
we lose our surcharge.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.244
Anywhere other than the lobby?

12:32.318 --> 12:35.810
Yeah, there's one
on the mezzanine, third floor.
Very private.

12:35.955 --> 12:37.786
Okay, thanks. Hey.

12:38.157 --> 12:39.818
9:53 p.m.

12:40.259 --> 12:42.557
A phone call
from the mezzanine.

12:43.062 --> 12:45.394
To 526 East 91st Street.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.259
Sid Fisher's place.

12:47.333 --> 12:49.494
I guess the bellboy
made the call.

12:49.568 --> 12:51.297
Mason left at 7:00.

12:52.004 --> 12:53.403
Talbott was still there.

12:53.472 --> 12:55.303
Somebody has good instincts.

12:55.374 --> 12:58.343
Which one of you said
Mr. Talbott should learn
to lie better?

12:58.410 --> 12:59.775
Both of us.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.975
He said 20 years on the force?

13:03.048 --> 13:06.347
Sixteen. Never made sergeant,
tried three times.

13:06.418 --> 13:09.216
I.A. Investigation
said payoffs from dealers.

13:09.288 --> 13:11.882
They never made the case.
He resigned.

13:15.928 --> 13:18.362
Even a hero needs a pension,
Barry.

13:18.764 --> 13:20.664
This is what you wanted
to talk about?

13:20.733 --> 13:22.724
How much is your pension?

13:24.036 --> 13:25.264
(Buren)
You don't have one.

13:25.704 --> 13:28.969
You didn't do 20 years.
Your career was over in 16.

13:29.842 --> 13:32.242
We're having a problem
with your statement.

13:32.311 --> 13:35.508
You see, Barry,
you said you never talked
to Sid Fisher.

13:35.581 --> 13:39.881
You said Mrs. Fisher
and her son were under
your full-time surveillance.

13:39.952 --> 13:44.787
Trouble is, somebody called
Mr. Fisher the night
before the broadcast.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.617
From a pay phone at the hotel.

13:46.692 --> 13:49.525
Now either you called,
or you know who did.

13:50.129 --> 13:53.860
One last shot
at the Sergeant's Exam.
Check the box.

13:54.667 --> 13:58.103
Is accessory to murder
an A or a B felony?

13:58.637 --> 14:00.264
I lost my pencil.

14:01.273 --> 14:03.264
The call was made, Barry.

14:03.776 --> 14:07.473
You were a cop,
work your own testimony,
see where it leads.

14:12.985 --> 14:14.009
[Sighs]

14:14.086 --> 14:15.212
<i>I...</i>

14:16.155 --> 14:17.747
I got four kids.

14:18.257 --> 14:19.884
I needed the job.

14:21.093 --> 14:25.154
I didn't call Fisher.
I didn't tell Mrs. Fisher
where the show was.

14:26.265 --> 14:27.391
The night before...

14:27.466 --> 14:30.833
Rick's on the phone
at the hotel. He's on
the phone with his lawyer.

14:30.903 --> 14:32.234
I'm worried.

14:32.304 --> 14:36.001
We know Fisher is wired,
he slugged the shrink
at the trial.

14:36.408 --> 14:39.468
I heard he pistol-whipped
some kid in the Army.

14:39.578 --> 14:41.341
I hear Rick say to the lawyer:

14:41.413 --> 14:43.813
"We talked about this.
What do you want me to do?

14:43.883 --> 14:45.282
"Cancel the show?

14:45.351 --> 14:48.912
If it happens, just tell me
what kind of trouble I'm in."

14:50.089 --> 14:52.489
I figured
I'd better clean my gun.

14:58.597 --> 15:01.896
Take a breath, Detective.
This is completely absurd.

15:01.967 --> 15:04.367
What am I hearing?
That you're investigating
my client?

15:04.436 --> 15:06.404
On the word of a crooked
ex-cop?

15:06.472 --> 15:09.407
Who was crooked
when you hired him.
And when I fired him.

15:09.475 --> 15:11.340
Did he tell you that?
Day after the show.

15:11.410 --> 15:14.436
Barry Talbott was hired
to protect my client's guests.

15:14.513 --> 15:16.504
I told Barry, heads-up...

15:16.815 --> 15:20.342
Fisher could track his wife.
Why do you think
I wanted Fisher on the show?

15:20.419 --> 15:23.820
We get him there,
we could've made sure
he didn't have a gun.

15:23.889 --> 15:28.019
The day it happened,
you were surprised
he owned a gun.

15:28.460 --> 15:31.054
The idea that my client
is responsible...

15:31.130 --> 15:33.360
Your client?
Check your shorts.

15:33.432 --> 15:37.630
Mr. Talbott tells us
that Mr. Mason called you
before the shooting.

15:37.703 --> 15:39.637
Says you knew about
the mystery guest.

15:39.705 --> 15:41.832
One, no such conversation.

15:42.207 --> 15:45.040
Two,
this imaginary conversation
took place?

15:45.144 --> 15:47.840
Privileged. Three,
if Talbott overheard it...

15:47.913 --> 15:52.043
privilege extends to him
as an employee of my client.
Close your notebook.

15:52.117 --> 15:53.982
The interview is over.

15:54.653 --> 15:56.052
She denied talking to him?

15:56.121 --> 15:57.952
Oh, but you should have seen
the look on her face.

15:58.023 --> 15:59.422
This is one scared lady.

15:59.491 --> 16:02.983
The D.A. Says it's not enough.
Dirty ex-cop?
Not a great witness.

16:03.062 --> 16:05.326
Look, we know
Mason set this up.

16:05.397 --> 16:08.332
He wanted the guy shot,
he somehow got the father
there.

16:08.400 --> 16:11.392
Mason, all these guys,
they'll do anything
for higher ratings.

16:11.470 --> 16:12.994
So, that's what's going down.

16:13.439 --> 16:15.964
Somebody gets killed,
these guys break out
the champagne.

16:16.041 --> 16:19.272
We can't prove that.
We don't know who called
the father from the hotel.

16:19.345 --> 16:22.803
Fisher's wife.
Mason called her.
Or he told the kid.

16:23.015 --> 16:25.745
That makes no sense.
Sarah Fisher protecting Mason?

16:25.818 --> 16:28.082
If she knew he set it up,
why won't she tell us?

16:28.153 --> 16:29.814
Who knows why this lady
does anything?

16:29.888 --> 16:32.152
Why'd she bring her kid
on TV in the first place?

16:32.224 --> 16:35.557
"Hello, America,
here's my molested son,
watch him suffer."

16:35.627 --> 16:38.721
We have shrinks
on the payroll.
Give them a call.

16:40.833 --> 16:44.098
You're asking me to explain
the behavior of a woman
I've never met.

16:44.169 --> 16:47.104
(Logan)
Look, we need an idea,
someplace to start.

16:47.172 --> 16:50.471
I usually try and avoid
making diagnoses over lunch.

16:54.013 --> 16:57.505
Okay, this is speculation.
What did Mason
do for Sarah Fisher?

16:57.583 --> 16:59.551
He gave her an obituary.

16:59.651 --> 17:03.246
She wanted Vinton dead?
I don't think so.
He molested her son.

17:03.355 --> 17:06.449
And in a way she was molested,
too. She goes on TV,
she gets support.

17:06.525 --> 17:08.857
She even gets applause.
She doesn't want
Vinton dead...

17:08.926 --> 17:10.622
<i>she wants to do
Oprah and Donahue with him.</i>

17:10.695 --> 17:12.128
That's her way
of getting through it.

17:12.196 --> 17:14.790
Then she wouldn't have helped
her husband kill Vinton.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.493
No, but her son might.

17:16.568 --> 17:19.002
That makes more sense.
Mason tells the kid...

17:19.070 --> 17:20.470
the kid phones his father.

17:20.539 --> 17:23.906
She's not protecting Mason.
She's protecting her son.

17:26.444 --> 17:28.503
You're making it worse
by being here.

17:28.580 --> 17:30.844
Your husband
didn't do this alone.

17:30.916 --> 17:33.248
Mason picked you and Scott
for a reason.

17:33.318 --> 17:36.754
<i>I watched his shows.
I guess
I should have realized...</i>

17:37.890 --> 17:40.154
I really can't tell you
anything.

17:40.225 --> 17:43.023
You knew what your husband
was planning...

17:43.495 --> 17:47.397
and you called him.
That makes you a coconspirator
and you could be indicted.

17:47.466 --> 17:50.299
Mom, don't...
Scotty! I don't know anything.

17:50.402 --> 17:53.371
Mason went to the hotel
and he told you
to call your husband.

17:53.439 --> 17:55.634
(Briscoe)
Did he tell you it would make
a better show?

17:55.707 --> 17:59.302
Did he offer you money?
Did he tell you your husband
was going to shoot Vinton?

17:59.378 --> 18:01.369
Unless, of course,
he talked to you, Scott.

18:01.447 --> 18:03.438
Scotty, I don't think
you should be here right now.

18:03.515 --> 18:04.641
Mom, you don't have to...

18:04.716 --> 18:07.617
It doesn't matter
who Mr. Mason talked to...

18:07.786 --> 18:09.447
it's too late now.

18:09.721 --> 18:10.745
[Sighs]

18:10.823 --> 18:13.758
Neither of us
should have been alone
with him.

18:14.159 --> 18:16.389
We shouldn't be alone
with you.

18:17.196 --> 18:18.390
[Telephones ringing]

18:18.464 --> 18:20.830
Olivet's right.
She's not giving up her son.

18:20.899 --> 18:25.836
Masors gonna get away
with this. Do you think
the D.A.'s gonna touch this?

18:25.904 --> 18:28.668
Nah, guys like Mason
don't go to jail.

18:28.740 --> 18:31.675
They go to country clubs
and they get awards.

18:32.010 --> 18:35.411
Yeah,
what did Sarah Fisher say?

18:36.081 --> 18:39.175
She watched his shows,
so she should have known.

18:39.751 --> 18:43.016
So?
So, do you watch his show?
I don't.

18:43.188 --> 18:46.282
Maybe we should.
Maybe the guy's got some bad
habits we don't know about.

18:46.358 --> 18:47.916
Yeah,
that'll get us an arrest.

18:47.993 --> 18:51.952
It might get us something
that will convince the D.A.
That this guy set up a murder.

18:55.367 --> 18:56.664
I never watch
the competition.

18:56.735 --> 18:58.066
Hey, this isn't
a press conference.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.002
Masors a major player
in this industry.

19:00.072 --> 19:02.870
Mr. Hudson, we're interested
in opinions, not resumes.

19:02.941 --> 19:04.841
And this is
a murder investigation.

19:04.910 --> 19:07.572
Well, which opinion
would you like?
Masors Nielsens were down?

19:07.646 --> 19:12.140
<i>Read it in Variety.
Which comes first?
His conviction or his Emmy?</i>

19:13.819 --> 19:17.380
Well, what are you, new?
Nobody in the business
was surprised.

19:17.456 --> 19:19.356
You see that woman in Florida?

19:19.424 --> 19:21.449
Husband shoots her
at their daughter's grave.

19:21.527 --> 19:23.392
Same day network news.

19:23.495 --> 19:25.326
I'd sell my poodle
for that kind of hype.

19:25.397 --> 19:27.763
And shooting a child molester
is even better.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.164
Cable operators are asking...

19:29.234 --> 19:32.465
the State of Nevada
to televise executions
pay-per-view.

19:32.538 --> 19:33.937
Snuff for you?

19:34.006 --> 19:37.772
Smell blood yet?
Television 101, no jeopardy,
no viewers.

19:37.843 --> 19:40.471
No viewers, no sponsors.
No sponsors...
No money.

19:40.546 --> 19:43.538
Oh, no, marquee.
The marquee,
his name over the title.

19:43.615 --> 19:46.607
Without a show,
Masors nothing
but letterhead.

19:47.786 --> 19:50.584
I know a girl, Debby Corrio.
Sweet kid.

19:51.490 --> 19:55.449
She used to work for him.
She'll take you backstage.

19:56.128 --> 19:59.029
Why does everyone think
I was fired? I quit.

19:59.231 --> 20:01.222
Better job?
Better life.

20:01.300 --> 20:02.790
I couldn't take
another minute.

20:02.868 --> 20:05.496
<i>What's on 4:30?
Final Confession.</i>

20:05.571 --> 20:07.937
5:00, last rites.

20:08.006 --> 20:11.066
Nobody ever got shot
on his show.
It was coming.

20:12.511 --> 20:13.876
You know the Pulisi trial?

20:13.946 --> 20:17.211
He had one of the jurors on.
Four days later,
the man disappeared.

20:17.282 --> 20:20.479
Hey, a mob-trial juror
goes on TV?
He's asking for it.

20:20.552 --> 20:24.386
You should have seen Mason
trying to convince him
he'd be safe.

20:25.190 --> 20:27.283
Eight months ago
we were doing this spot.

20:27.359 --> 20:30.328
I found a diva, 19,
has an act in The Village.

20:30.395 --> 20:33.262
I say, "Rick Mason
wants you to sing
on his show."

20:33.332 --> 20:35.027
So, she's in heaven.

20:35.100 --> 20:38.558
No, he's at Bergdorf's
picking out
a little black dress.

20:38.837 --> 20:40.828
He's wearing a dress. So?

20:41.573 --> 20:43.507
You want to see why I quit?

20:43.575 --> 20:45.008
I'll get you the tape.

20:45.711 --> 20:47.804
I don't care if he's a bully.
It's not admissible.

20:47.879 --> 20:49.540
We're not talking
admissibility.

20:49.615 --> 20:52.982
It's motive. They're trying
to give you a reason
to make the case.

20:53.051 --> 20:54.416
Watch this.

20:56.555 --> 21:00.958

The father walked out
of the show
and had a coronary.

22:17.669 --> 22:20.399
The kid felt so guilty,
a week later
he killed himself.

22:20.472 --> 22:22.235
Mason destroys people.

22:22.307 --> 22:25.606
It doesn't prove anything.
Claire, it proves who he is.

22:25.677 --> 22:29.477
We can't make this work,
all we got left
is rubber hoses.

22:30.482 --> 22:32.382
You can hit him harder.

22:39.524 --> 22:41.321
You can't be serious.

22:41.560 --> 22:43.357
You don't think
we should go after him?

22:43.428 --> 22:46.397
What he does may be sleazy,
but it's not criminal.

22:46.465 --> 22:48.296
If he arranged a murder,
it is.

22:48.367 --> 22:51.598
You can't believe
that Mason knew Fisher
was coming with a gun.

22:51.670 --> 22:54.138
Miss Kincaid, he wanted
to get the man there.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.231
Expected a fistfight,
got a homicide.

22:56.308 --> 22:59.539
If intent to cause injury
causes death, it's man one.

22:59.611 --> 23:01.101
At the least,
it's facilitation.

23:01.179 --> 23:03.079
How do we prove facilitation?

23:03.148 --> 23:06.379
You're not suggesting
we offer the father a deal
for his sors testimony?

23:06.451 --> 23:08.442
Why not?
He gets man one anyway.

23:08.520 --> 23:11.148
And no jury convicts
on murder two.

23:11.690 --> 23:14.921
Half the country
wants to name him
Father of the Year.

23:14.993 --> 23:16.961
You know what Masorll do.

23:17.028 --> 23:19.758
Call himself a journalist
and wrap himself
in the First Amendment.

23:19.831 --> 23:23.062
Well, let him wrap himself
in the American flag.
He's not Tom Brokaw.

23:23.135 --> 23:27.094
By the way, Adam,
the father fired his lawyer.
He's going pro se.

23:27.205 --> 23:28.297
Jerk.

23:28.807 --> 23:31.401
So, I figure we offer him
a deal,
he doesn't want to take it...

23:31.476 --> 23:33.774
we say we're adding his son
to the charge.

23:33.845 --> 23:36.905
It's not the father
we're after, it's Mason.

23:37.082 --> 23:38.913
We're not going to
indict the kid to get him.

23:38.984 --> 23:41.509
No, but the father
doesn't know that.

23:42.454 --> 23:43.819
Let's hope.

23:44.689 --> 23:47.021
My son had nothing to do
with it.

23:47.626 --> 23:48.650
[Sighs]

23:48.727 --> 23:52.458
Well, we think that your wife
will testify otherwise.

23:53.165 --> 23:54.894
Not against my son.

23:57.235 --> 23:58.702
Mr. Fisher...

23:59.971 --> 24:03.737
if your son did help you
get to Dr. Vinton...

24:04.743 --> 24:06.404
he's an accessory.

24:07.212 --> 24:09.112
He will go to Spofford.

24:09.181 --> 24:11.206
I shot a man on principle.

24:12.784 --> 24:15.309
<i>You torment my son
in front of me...</i>

24:16.855 --> 24:20.814
You have no principles.
And you speak for the State.

24:22.627 --> 24:24.527
We'll see you in court.

24:25.730 --> 24:28.665
We'll provide you with help
for your defense.

24:31.636 --> 24:35.970
If you leave my son alone,
I'll tell you
what you want to know.

24:39.544 --> 24:43.036
The offer is manslaughter
in the first degree,
you do 8-to-25...

24:43.114 --> 24:46.572
if you tell the truth and
if your testimony is useful.
That is the deal.

24:46.651 --> 24:51.179
The deal is my son
never appears in court,
for any reason.

24:51.890 --> 24:53.084
Agreed?

24:53.325 --> 24:55.259
I can promise that
he won't be indicted.

24:55.327 --> 24:57.852
I cannot promise you
that he won't appear
as witness.

24:57.929 --> 25:00.227
You don't need him
as a witness.

25:03.201 --> 25:06.193
Mason called
a couple of weeks
before the show.

25:08.039 --> 25:10.405
Said Sarah was dragging
Scotty on.

25:11.610 --> 25:12.634
Humiliate him.

25:12.711 --> 25:17.148
Vinton sells a million books,
laughs till he cries.
What am I going to do?

25:17.983 --> 25:22.647
He told me it was at Waverly.
I went and shot
the son of a bitch.

25:22.921 --> 25:24.445
(Stone)
That's a lie, sir.

25:25.891 --> 25:29.383
I told you the deal depends
on you telling the truth.

25:30.095 --> 25:32.120
I cannot let you
commit perjury.

25:32.197 --> 25:36.031
I am not dragging Scotty
through anything else,
do you hear me?

25:36.668 --> 25:39.330
My boy had to testify
against Vinton.

25:40.705 --> 25:44.004
He never appears
in court again
the rest of his life.

25:45.343 --> 25:48.506
I didn't get any calls,
I didn't talk to anybody.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.847
We can't use him. He'll lie.

25:59.291 --> 26:01.486
He probably
did talk to Mason.

26:02.160 --> 26:04.924
Well, that's not
the whole truth
and we both know it.

26:04.996 --> 26:09.330
He laid it all on Mason
to keep it away from his son,
and Masors smart.

26:09.801 --> 26:14.534
He used the son to incite
the father, makes facilitation
that much harder to prove.

26:14.606 --> 26:18.542
Plus, he could figure that
the Fishers would never want
the kid back in the limelight.

26:18.610 --> 26:20.202

there's no case.

you both as accessories.

to feel that way.

where it was going to be.

for you.

Is this today's solution?
Blame it on our son?

27:27.579 --> 27:32.073
Don't dump this on me.
I put him in therapy,
you put him in a murder trial.

At least
we can have recovery.

27:35.086 --> 27:37.486

Scotty's telling the truth,
he called Sid.

27:44.429 --> 27:46.624
He told me after it happened.

27:48.066 --> 27:49.431
You wanted corroboration.

You're a public servant.

29:20.558 --> 29:22.389
You serve the public

29:22.460 --> 29:24.018

Neither did my client.
He had no motive.

nobody indicted him.
Nobody got shot on his show.

The call is privileged.

30:19.150 --> 30:20.981
Mr. Talbott worked
for my client. In essence...

30:21.052 --> 30:23.680
he was my client.
Oh, really? On what grounds?

30:23.755 --> 30:26.656
He was a necessary agent

conducting his business.

30:26.724 --> 30:29.716
The necessary agent theory?
Fine for the law journals,

30:29.794 --> 30:31.352
We don't make law here,

Really? You want to try
proving any of that?

31:21.012 --> 31:22.138

That he covers the news.

31:54.012 --> 31:57.448
But in this case,
he didn't cover the news,
he made it.

Nothing draws people
to their television sets...

32:05.823 --> 32:08.451

the higher the ratings.

32:20.838 --> 32:25.002
The higher the ratings,
the more money
goes into Mr. Masors pockets.

32:26.511 --> 32:29.503
And these stakes
are human lives.

32:31.382 --> 32:33.782
Not just the life
of Dr. Vinton...

32:33.952 --> 32:36.921
but the lives of
the entire Fisher family.

32:38.623 --> 32:43.560
Now, Mr. Mason
brought them together as
you would gasoline and fire.

32:44.562 --> 32:46.860
And he waited
for the explosion.

32:48.399 --> 32:51.698
The People will prove
that the explosion came...

32:52.537 --> 32:55.700
because the defendant
deliberately lit the match.

32:58.743 --> 33:02.144
Mr. Stone has a strange notion
of human behavior.

33:02.680 --> 33:06.844
The defendant, he believes,
is responsible
for what other people do.

33:07.485 --> 33:09.953
He says, let's be clear
about motive.

33:10.021 --> 33:12.819
I suggest, let's be clear
about the facts.

33:13.358 --> 33:17.419
Here's what you'll learn from
the witnesses. The defendant
didn't fire a gun.

33:17.495 --> 33:19.929
He didn't put a gun
in anyone's hand,
he didn't coerce...

33:19.998 --> 33:22.296
anyone to appear
on his program.

33:23.434 --> 33:25.868
And I remind you
of one other fact.

33:26.437 --> 33:29.895
Long before the defendant
ever met the Fisher family...

33:30.174 --> 33:33.234
Scott Fisher's father
attacked Joseph Vinton.

33:34.545 --> 33:38.481
Did Richard Mason provoke
Mr. Fisher to fire a gun?

33:39.851 --> 33:43.150
Or was he provoked
in a courtroom...

33:43.921 --> 33:46.822
long before Richard Mason
ever heard of him?

33:49.494 --> 33:51.792
That phone call
scared the hell out of me.

33:51.863 --> 33:54.093
What specifically worried you?

33:54.298 --> 33:56.823
Mr. Mason always said
Fisher might show up.

33:56.901 --> 34:00.200
When he asked his lawyer
what kind of trouble
he'll be in...

34:00.271 --> 34:02.136
I figure he knows for sure.

34:02.206 --> 34:05.369
Did you do anything
about your concerns?
Well, I told him:

34:05.443 --> 34:08.536
"Let me hire an extra man."
He said, "Forget it.

34:08.612 --> 34:13.346
Fisher comes,
I'll let the guy talk."
I said, "The guy's nuts...

34:13.650 --> 34:17.178
anything can happen."
And what did Mr. Mason
say to that?

34:17.655 --> 34:20.681
He said, "We're doing a show.
Things are supposed
to happen."

34:20.757 --> 34:22.726
Thank you. Your witness.

34:24.328 --> 34:26.728
So, Mr. Talbott, you thought
there'd be trouble?

34:26.797 --> 34:28.264
Did you call the police?

34:28.331 --> 34:31.995
I followed Mr. Masors orders.
Did you follow orders
as a cop?

34:32.070 --> 34:34.630
Why did you leave
the Police Department?
Objection.

34:34.705 --> 34:36.764
Is it true
you resigned because...

34:36.841 --> 34:39.275
Miss Hutton.
Counsel will approach.

34:43.414 --> 34:45.541
When he objects,
you wait for my ruling.

34:45.616 --> 34:49.177
Now, Mr. Talbott wasrt
convicted of a crime, get near
that again, you'll regret it.

34:49.253 --> 34:51.016
Objection sustained.

34:53.791 --> 34:57.955
Mr. Talbott, this call you say
you overheard.

34:58.429 --> 35:00.488
Did you mention it
in your statement
to the police?

35:00.565 --> 35:02.032
No, I didn't.

35:02.100 --> 35:04.625
Well, you lied then,
or you're lying now.

35:04.702 --> 35:07.296
Is it true you no longer work
for Richard Mason...

35:07.371 --> 35:10.898
that you were fired
the day after the shooting
of Joseph Vinton?

35:10.975 --> 35:13.341
Yeah, I was fired.
Well, you lied to the police.

35:13.411 --> 35:17.108
I wonder, are you angry enough
at Richard Mason to lie now?

35:19.217 --> 35:23.711
I didn't want my son on TV.
What did you tell Mr. Mason?

35:26.124 --> 35:30.925
I said, "You put Scotty on,
I'm gonna be there.
It'll be trouble."

35:31.996 --> 35:36.490
Mason says, "It's news
to America. You don't like
the news, make your own."

35:36.868 --> 35:40.099
And what did that mean to you?
Objection.
Asks for conclusion.

35:40.171 --> 35:42.401
No, I'll allow it. Mr. Fisher?

35:43.474 --> 35:45.101
It meant lump it.

35:45.209 --> 35:49.043
He wanted me to come
and attack Vinton.
Thank you. Your witness.

35:50.715 --> 35:54.242
So, you testified your son
told you where to go that day.

35:54.318 --> 35:58.982
Can you tell the court
why wasrt Scott charged
as an accessory in this crime?

36:00.925 --> 36:01.914
I don't know.

36:01.993 --> 36:05.019
Is that so? You said you
made a deal with Mr. Stone.

36:05.096 --> 36:08.259
You'd implicate Mr. Mason
in exchange for
a reduced sentence.

36:08.332 --> 36:10.664
Was your son a part
of that deal?

36:13.337 --> 36:16.636
They threatened
to indict Scotty.
"They," Mr. Fisher?

36:16.741 --> 36:19.073
Mr. Stone,
the District Attorney.

36:20.278 --> 36:22.371
He said he'd indict my son.

36:23.314 --> 36:27.307
Compelling incentive.
If my son were threatened,
I'd say anything.

36:27.618 --> 36:29.085
No further questions.

36:29.153 --> 36:31.951
Mason did it!
He made Scotty call me.

36:32.123 --> 36:34.819
He's a parasite! He's filth!
Mr. Fisher!

36:35.927 --> 36:39.158
The jury will ignore
the witness's remark.
Strike it from the record.

36:39.230 --> 36:42.757
Redirect, Your Honor?
If the witness
can control himself.

36:43.234 --> 36:47.364
Mr. Fisher, did you ever offer
to lie in your testimony?

36:49.507 --> 36:52.408
I wanted to say
Mason told me where to go.

36:54.378 --> 36:57.541
I wanted to say Scotty
had nothing to do with it.

36:58.182 --> 37:00.047
And how did I respond?

37:00.751 --> 37:05.450
You said that was perjury.
You said
you couldn't let me do that.

37:06.591 --> 37:08.889
Thank you.
No further questions.

37:11.395 --> 37:14.489
It was at the hotel.
I was in my room.

37:14.565 --> 37:16.430
And what did Mr. Mason
tell you?

37:16.500 --> 37:20.994
He said where the show
was gonna be...

37:21.372 --> 37:22.862
might be painful.

37:22.940 --> 37:27.434
And what did you say to that?
I told him I was scared...

37:27.511 --> 37:29.604
about seeing Dr. Vinton.

37:30.314 --> 37:33.374
I didn't want to know
where it was.

37:34.518 --> 37:38.352
He said he had to tell me.
The Waverly,
where Dr. Vinton...

37:38.422 --> 37:40.617
took me after the sessions.

37:40.925 --> 37:44.884
Did Mr. Mason explain to you
why he had to tell you
where it was?

37:46.163 --> 37:48.495
He said my dad
ought to be there.

37:49.567 --> 37:53.936
He couldn't tell Dad
where the show was
going to be, but I could.

37:56.007 --> 38:00.273
He took me to
a pay phone downstairs
and I called my dad.

38:00.411 --> 38:03.039
Thanks, Scott. Your witness.

38:05.082 --> 38:09.883
I know this is difficult
for you, Scott. All we want
you to do is tell the truth.

38:09.954 --> 38:14.015
Now, you met with Dr. Vinton
for how long?
About three years.

38:14.091 --> 38:17.060
And did your mother ever
ask you about your sessions
with the doctor?

38:17.128 --> 38:19.392
Objection. Relevance?
Goes to credibility.

38:19.463 --> 38:21.988
I'll allow it, but make
the connection quickly.

38:22.066 --> 38:25.968
Go on, Scott.
Sure, my mom asked me.

38:26.170 --> 38:30.129
And in three years
you never told her
what Dr. Vinton did to you?

38:31.942 --> 38:35.343
No, she wanted me to go.
You wanted to
please your mother...

38:35.413 --> 38:37.608
so you didn't tell the truth.

38:38.149 --> 38:40.709
You want to make it
sound like I'm lying.

38:40.785 --> 38:44.778
I'm not. Mr. Mason told me
to call my dad.

38:44.855 --> 38:47.289
I didn't know
what he was gonna do.

38:47.591 --> 38:49.889
Scott, didn't Mr. Stone
prepare you for today?

38:49.960 --> 38:51.951
Didrt he tell you exactly
what to say?

38:52.029 --> 38:55.521
He told me just like you,
to tell the truth.

38:58.469 --> 38:59.993
No further questions.

39:01.005 --> 39:03.200
She couldn't break him, Adam.

39:03.607 --> 39:07.566
Ben, who said all cases
are made
by prepping the witnesses?

39:07.678 --> 39:10.476
You did, I think.
About 400 times.
Oh, yeah.

39:10.548 --> 39:13.608
Ben, Mr. Mason
just held a press conference.

39:13.684 --> 39:15.242
He fully expects
to be acquitted.

39:15.319 --> 39:18.413
He's suing for false arrest
and malicious prosecution.

39:18.489 --> 39:20.184
$5 million in damages.

39:20.257 --> 39:22.020
Well, the last guy
that tried that
with me...

39:22.093 --> 39:23.355
is still doing
three-to-nine.

39:23.427 --> 39:25.918
I wouldn't eat that canary
just yet.

39:26.163 --> 39:30.190
It's a long trip
from your witnesses
to motive and conviction.

39:30.301 --> 39:32.166
I'm pretty sure
Mr. Mason will get us there.

39:32.236 --> 39:35.000
Well, but he might be
a better performer
than you.

39:35.072 --> 39:36.903
Certainly had
as much practice.

39:36.974 --> 39:39.204
Well, then I
can learn something.

39:43.214 --> 39:45.842
Why did you visit Scott
at the hotel that night?

39:45.916 --> 39:50.182
I spend time with all
my subjects. Especially
a vulnerable 15-year-old.

39:50.254 --> 39:54.156
What did you tell Scott?
I reminded him
how hard it would be.

39:55.393 --> 39:58.385
Frankly,
I wanted to assure myself that
he wouldn't be damaged...

39:58.462 --> 40:01.625
and if I wasrt convinced,
I would have canceled
the show.

40:01.699 --> 40:05.760
Did you tell him where
the show would be and ask him
to call his father?

40:05.836 --> 40:08.396
Absolutely not.
I spoke to Mr. Fisher.

40:08.472 --> 40:10.736
Anyone could see the man
was dangerous.

40:10.808 --> 40:14.175
Did you instruct Barry Talbott
to curtail his vigilance
in any way?

40:14.245 --> 40:15.644
The opposite.

40:15.713 --> 40:19.877
I was concerned
that Mr. Fisher might find out
the location of the show.

40:19.950 --> 40:22.851
I told Mr. Talbott
to stop him at all costs.

40:23.921 --> 40:28.756
Mr. Mason, do you
consider yourself to have
high professional standards?

40:28.993 --> 40:30.324
Yes, I do.

40:30.528 --> 40:34.089
There are some things
I will not do
in pursuit of a story.

40:34.465 --> 40:39.198
I've never used a hidden
camera. I don't surprise
subjects in parking lots.

40:40.070 --> 40:42.402
And I don't pay
convicted felons.

40:42.840 --> 40:47.436
I might add that some of
my colleagues at the networks
are not so particular.

40:47.878 --> 40:49.846
Thank you. Your witness.

40:51.816 --> 40:55.183
So, you have high professional
standards, sir, yet...

40:55.686 --> 40:59.122
you put the Fisher family
on your show, you knew
that Mr. Fisher was dangerous.

40:59.190 --> 41:00.623
Is that a high standard?

41:00.691 --> 41:03.854
I took every precaution.
Didrt you provoke Mr. Fisher?

41:03.928 --> 41:06.920
Didrt you refuse
to hire additional security?

41:07.131 --> 41:10.066
Didrt you manipulate
Scott Fisher?
None of that is true.

41:10.134 --> 41:13.194
What about guests on your
previous shows?
Didrt you arrange to have...

41:13.270 --> 41:15.363
Objection. May we approach?

41:19.410 --> 41:22.675
Mr. Masors past programs
are irrelevant.
It goes to motive, Your Honor.

41:22.746 --> 41:25.306
And they're inadmissible.
Put it in your pocket, Ben.

41:25.382 --> 41:28.146
I didn't let her do it
to your witness,
you don't do it to hers.

41:28.219 --> 41:29.982
Objection sustained.

41:37.761 --> 41:39.092
Mr. Stone?

41:41.098 --> 41:44.397
Are you telling this court,
sir, that you feel
no responsibility...

41:44.468 --> 41:45.765
for the death of Dr. Vinton?

41:45.836 --> 41:50.273
It was a tragedy,
but I would never knowingly
put anyone's life in danger.

41:52.743 --> 41:55.177
Judge, you can't allow this.
You want to go
in the back door?

41:55.246 --> 41:56.611
Your client opened the door.

41:56.680 --> 41:59.672
Hello there,
send the arguments
toward my door.

42:01.619 --> 42:05.055
Mr. Stone tried to sneak in
character testimony before.

42:05.122 --> 42:08.182
He wanted to tarnish my client
but you said no.

42:08.459 --> 42:12.088
Mr. Masors past programs
haven't suddenly
become relevant.

42:12.263 --> 42:14.197
But they have,
Alice. Mason lied.

42:14.265 --> 42:16.790
He said he never
put anyone in danger.
He did.

42:17.134 --> 42:21.969
He said "knowingly."
He would never knowingly
put anyone in danger.

42:22.406 --> 42:23.737
Ben, you have rebuttal
on this?

42:23.807 --> 42:24.796
(Stone)
I do, Your Honor.

42:24.909 --> 42:27.377
A witness who was there
and she'll testify.

42:27.444 --> 42:29.435
It's grossly prejudicial.

42:30.047 --> 42:34.313
<i>People v. Zackowitz,
Benjamin Cardozo on the
New York Court of Appeals.</i>

42:34.385 --> 42:35.818
<i>What about Wigmore?</i>

42:35.886 --> 42:39.014
Character is never an issue
unless the defendant chooses
to make it one...

42:39.089 --> 42:42.752
which is what your client did.
It's too bad, he should
have kept his mouth shut.

42:42.826 --> 42:43.884
I'm going to allow this...

42:43.961 --> 42:46.759
but you better hope
your witness knows
what she's talking about.

42:50.334 --> 42:52.234
We wanted the juror
from the Pulisi trial...

42:52.303 --> 42:55.534
to talk about
organized crime.

42:56.106 --> 42:58.802
We picked juror number six,
James Davis.

42:59.009 --> 43:02.467
And why did you want
that particular juror
on your show?

43:03.047 --> 43:06.039
He was the one who pushed
the jury to convict.

43:06.283 --> 43:09.275
He said
he would talk about it,
but he was afraid.

43:09.353 --> 43:13.380
Mr. Mason assured him
that we'd alter his voice,
silhouette his face.

43:13.457 --> 43:15.982
(Stone)
And did Mr. Mason do that?

43:16.060 --> 43:17.527
Sure, he did.

43:18.429 --> 43:21.057
Then he invited
Nick Pulisi's son
on the show.

43:21.131 --> 43:24.032
Mr. Davis didn't know
until halfway through.

43:25.035 --> 43:27.435
He disappeared
from a parking lot.

43:31.809 --> 43:33.606
They never found him.

43:37.081 --> 43:40.312
Were you involved in the show
that featured...

43:40.517 --> 43:43.179
prostitutes in Times Square?

43:43.420 --> 43:45.445
I helped find those girls.

43:46.056 --> 43:50.993
The day of the show one
of them, her name was Cheryl,
she was a little tired.

43:51.762 --> 43:53.229
Mr. Mason was upset.

43:53.297 --> 43:56.824
The first time we talked
to her, she was all lit up,
she was funny.

43:56.900 --> 43:59.528
Lit up, you mean
that she was on drugs?

44:00.070 --> 44:01.799
She was on cocaine.

44:03.040 --> 44:06.305
(Stone)
And what did Mr. Mason do
to help her be funny?

44:06.377 --> 44:09.540
He gave her $300, told her
to take a little walk.

44:10.014 --> 44:11.538
Did she come back?

44:11.615 --> 44:12.707
Yeah.

44:13.617 --> 44:14.948
She was her old self.

44:15.019 --> 44:17.351
She was buzzed.

44:19.023 --> 44:22.015
We were just off the air
when she keeled over.

44:22.159 --> 44:24.423
Later, we found out
she bought some bad stuff.

44:24.495 --> 44:26.929
She barely made it
to the hospital.

44:28.165 --> 44:30.395
Miss Corrio,
one last question.

44:31.168 --> 44:34.535
How did Mr. Mason
react to that news?

44:35.839 --> 44:37.830
He said, "What a waste...

44:38.108 --> 44:40.542
too bad she didn't OD
on the show."

44:40.644 --> 44:44.774
He said,
"What we really needed was for
somebody to die on the air."

44:49.653 --> 44:52.850
On the first count
of the indictment manslaughter
in the first degree...

44:52.923 --> 44:54.618
how does the jury find?

44:54.692 --> 44:57.024
We find the defendant
not guilty.

44:57.494 --> 44:59.291
(Steinman)
On the second count
of the indictment,

44:59.363 --> 45:01.058
the charge
of criminal facilitation...

45:01.131 --> 45:03.929
in the first degree,
how does the jury find?

45:04.001 --> 45:06.196
We find the defendant guilty.

45:11.909 --> 45:14.036
Move to continue bail
until sentencing.

45:14.111 --> 45:15.635
Motion granted.

[People chattering]

45:20.851 --> 45:23.376
(Mason)
I'm disappointed,
but not only for myself.

45:23.454 --> 45:26.082
It's a sad day
for the First Amendment.

45:28.125 --> 45:30.491
He'll do 18 months,
better than nothing.

45:30.561 --> 45:32.756
Eighteen months
is what Vinton got,
right?

45:32.830 --> 45:34.855
Mason
could write his own book
in that time.

45:34.932 --> 45:37.867
Oh, he's off the air.
Oh, I don't know about that.

45:37.935 --> 45:40.995
Five hundred cable channels
coming? He could start
the Prison Channel.

45:41.071 --> 45:42.402

45:42.473 --> 45:44.134
