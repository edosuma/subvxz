WEBVTT

00:10.911 --> 00:11.845
What do we got?

00:11.945 --> 00:13.181
The victim is
Rosalie Gonzalez,

00:13.281 --> 00:15.949
23 years old, just moved
in six months ago.

00:16.050 --> 00:18.619
You the first on the scene?
Yeah, unfortunately.

00:18.719 --> 00:20.088
What do we know so far?

00:20.188 --> 00:21.589
The call came in
as a wellness check.

00:21.689 --> 00:22.790
Her parents hadn't
heard from her,

00:22.890 --> 00:24.525
and she didn't
show up for work today.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.361
When I got here,
I rang the bell,

00:27.461 --> 00:29.163
but there was
no answer.

00:29.263 --> 00:30.564
Any signs of forced entry?

00:30.664 --> 00:31.732
No. The back door was open,

00:31.832 --> 00:33.501
but not forced.
That's how I got in.

00:35.569 --> 00:37.871
The vic's phone. Her
mom's been calling her

00:37.971 --> 00:39.607
since I got here.
You got an address?

00:39.707 --> 00:40.741
Yeah.
Good.

00:40.841 --> 00:42.343
Make the notification in person.

00:42.443 --> 00:44.078
Will do.

00:44.878 --> 00:47.448
The rosary beads
are black onyx, the note...

00:47.548 --> 00:49.217
"Return to me,
for I have redeemed you."

00:49.317 --> 00:51.219
Strangled, posed...

00:51.319 --> 00:54.288
it has all the earmarks
of our Dr. Walker.

00:54.388 --> 00:56.557
Yeah, except he's
in Bellehaven right now.

00:56.657 --> 00:57.891
Reagan.

00:57.991 --> 00:59.026
What?

00:59.127 --> 01:01.162
Rosary beads,
posed, note?

01:01.262 --> 01:03.364
Okay, got it.

01:03.464 --> 01:04.665
They just found another victim.

01:04.765 --> 01:07.368
Same MO, except this
one's in Suffolk County.

01:07.468 --> 01:09.203
Copycat?
God only knows.

01:09.303 --> 01:11.172
I got to take a road trip.

01:11.272 --> 01:13.941
The city is still continuing
to see a surge in crime--

01:14.041 --> 01:16.544
okay, not just quality-of-life,
but violent crime--

01:16.644 --> 01:17.778
among the homeless

01:17.878 --> 01:19.580
and emotionally disturbed population.

01:19.680 --> 01:20.881
That's about to end.

01:20.981 --> 01:22.550
Oh, is that a crystal ball
you've got there?

01:22.650 --> 01:25.119
No, just a dynamic initiative.

01:25.219 --> 01:27.821
I'm excited to announce
Open Arms,

01:27.921 --> 01:31.492
a joint effort with the NYPD
to remove and transport

01:31.592 --> 01:33.661
homeless and
emotionally disturbed citizens

01:33.761 --> 01:36.964
from our streets and
to dedicated shelters.

01:37.064 --> 01:38.166
By charging them with what?

01:38.266 --> 01:39.800
They don't need to be charged.

01:39.900 --> 01:42.703
Our finest will be
strategically and humanely

01:42.803 --> 01:44.071
"talking them into handcuffs,"

01:44.172 --> 01:47.408
the first step for
their fresh start.

01:49.377 --> 01:51.445
I mean...

01:51.545 --> 01:53.981
"talk 'em into handcuffs"?

01:54.081 --> 01:58.186
The only way that works
on our streets, with our cops,

01:58.286 --> 01:59.720
is if that talk starts with

01:59.820 --> 02:01.589
"You're under arrest,
dot dot dot."

02:01.689 --> 02:04.225
But the mayor made it sound
like it was an option.

02:04.325 --> 02:06.927
Well, I don't know, Helen.

02:07.027 --> 02:09.263
It's hard to know
what the mayor's thinking,

02:09.363 --> 02:12.866
but you can't just
pluck people off the street

02:12.966 --> 02:15.236
because they might
cause a disturbance

02:15.336 --> 02:17.538
or could be bad for tourism.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.473
Commissioner, the mayor called
Open Arms

02:19.573 --> 02:21.509
a joint effort with NYPD.

02:21.609 --> 02:26.747
Well, I just heard about
"mission impossible"

02:26.847 --> 02:29.817
about an hour ago,
like the rest of the world.

02:30.718 --> 02:32.486
And, look...

02:32.586 --> 02:35.323
I'm just as surprised

02:35.423 --> 02:38.759
and dismayed as my cops.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.632
And that's all, folks.

02:46.767 --> 02:50.404
I can't go! Please!

02:50.504 --> 02:52.473
My son's at home.
You have to stay still.

02:52.573 --> 02:53.841
Hey, I'm Officer Janko,

02:53.941 --> 02:55.576
this is Officer Badillo.
We're going to help you.

02:55.676 --> 02:56.577
Where's your son?

02:56.677 --> 02:58.446
At home with a neighbor...

02:58.546 --> 02:59.713
We got her address.

02:59.813 --> 03:00.881
Okay. We're gonna
make sure he's okay.

03:00.981 --> 03:02.583
Who did this to you?

03:02.683 --> 03:04.585
Uh, uh...
Did you get a good look
at him or her?

03:04.685 --> 03:08.622
Him. Uh, g-gray hoodie,

03:08.722 --> 03:10.123
um, black jeans and...

03:10.224 --> 03:11.859
black and red sneakers.

03:11.959 --> 03:12.960
Young? Old?

03:13.060 --> 03:15.128
Twenties, I-I think...
All right.

03:15.229 --> 03:17.398
2-9 David to central, be advised

03:17.498 --> 03:18.899
we are on the lookout
for one suspect.

03:18.999 --> 03:21.068
Male, last seen headed south
on the East River...

03:21.168 --> 03:22.536
...wearing black jeans,
a gray hoodie,

03:22.636 --> 03:24.004
and black and red sneakers.

03:25.773 --> 03:27.508
I think this could be him.

03:27.608 --> 03:29.243
Matches the description.
Pull us over.

03:30.311 --> 03:32.846
Hey, police. Hold up. Hey!

03:44.625 --> 03:46.427
Help me cuff him up.

03:46.527 --> 03:48.028
Man, I didn't even do nothing.

03:48.128 --> 03:49.162
Yeah? Why'd you run?

03:49.263 --> 03:50.364
Is it a crime to run?

03:50.464 --> 03:51.332
And what happened
to your hands, huh?

03:51.432 --> 03:52.366
Man, that's nothing.

03:52.466 --> 03:53.667
Looks like blood.

03:53.767 --> 03:55.469
You're under
arrest for assault.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.204
Looks like you're
gonna need a lawyer.

03:57.305 --> 03:58.406
I don't need no lawyer.

03:58.506 --> 03:59.673
You just call Erin Reagan.

03:59.773 --> 04:01.875
Erin Reagan? Why is that?

04:01.975 --> 04:03.577
'Cause she'll take care of me.

04:05.112 --> 04:06.780
Come on.

04:06.880 --> 04:09.717
Fighting fire with fire
just burns down the house.

04:09.817 --> 04:11.251
And what would you have me do?

04:11.352 --> 04:13.887
Shuffle on up to the mic
with marbles in my mouth?

04:13.987 --> 04:15.923
I'd have you let me do my job!
Be happy to.

04:16.023 --> 04:18.125
You can start with
rewinding the clock

04:18.225 --> 04:19.727
and giving me
a heads-up on this.

04:19.827 --> 04:21.829
Boss, to be fair, it
came out of left field.

04:21.929 --> 04:24.231
For all of us.
Let's take a time-out here.

04:24.332 --> 04:25.533
And do what?

04:25.633 --> 04:27.868
Let the mayor
rewrite the Patrol Guide?

04:28.736 --> 04:30.270
Look, call his office,

04:30.371 --> 04:32.973
and give him a heads-up
that I'm coming over.

04:33.073 --> 04:35.676
See? No ambush.
I'm playing nice.

04:35.776 --> 04:36.744
I'm riding shotgun.

04:36.844 --> 04:39.547
No, you're not. Not this time.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.148
I am not gonna give you a chance

04:41.248 --> 04:44.284
to water down
just how insane this is.

04:49.957 --> 04:53.126
I've got a ton
of vacation time banked.

04:53.226 --> 04:55.095
High time I took some.

05:04.438 --> 05:05.673
I don't know.

05:07.708 --> 05:08.609
Hi.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.143
Hi...

05:10.243 --> 05:12.045
I just wanted to pop by.
I heard that you're announcing

05:12.145 --> 05:14.715
your run at the Bar Association
dinner on Friday night.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.084
That was supposed
to be a secret.

05:17.184 --> 05:18.952
I just wanted to wish you luck.

05:19.052 --> 05:20.454
Well, you could've
wished me luck there.

05:20.554 --> 05:21.555
I'm not gonna be there.

05:21.655 --> 05:24.358
But you love hosting. Oh.

05:25.893 --> 05:27.895
You bowed out for me.
It's better this way.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.797
The focus should just be
on your run.

05:29.897 --> 05:33.033
Not that your ex-husband
is introducing you.

05:33.133 --> 05:35.202
Anyway, it's, uh,
it's no big deal.

05:35.302 --> 05:37.004
I got to go. Um...

05:37.771 --> 05:38.739
Break a leg.

05:38.839 --> 05:41.108
Thank you.

05:43.010 --> 05:46.246
Erin.
Nice to see you, Anthony.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.314
Hey.

05:47.415 --> 05:48.782
What's going on?

05:48.882 --> 05:50.451
There's a woman, Louise
Johnson, in the hospital.

05:50.551 --> 05:51.819
She was
assaulted, beaten

05:51.919 --> 05:53.921
and stomped on
by one Tyler Green.

05:54.021 --> 05:55.456
Why is that name familiar?

05:55.556 --> 05:57.658
He was arrested for assault
a couple of weeks ago.

05:57.758 --> 05:59.693
Right. We made him an offer...

05:59.793 --> 06:01.995
And agreed to a program,
instead of jail time.

06:02.095 --> 06:03.897
But apparently, he hasn't
shown up for the program.

06:03.997 --> 06:05.733
Well, how's the victim?
How's she doing?

06:05.833 --> 06:07.701
I really don't know.

06:17.811 --> 06:20.748
You know,
never thought I'd find you

06:20.848 --> 06:22.816
in a setting
like this.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.885
Me, neither.

06:25.853 --> 06:28.321
Far cry from Staten Island.

06:29.289 --> 06:31.258
Yeah. Aw.

06:32.526 --> 06:33.827
You look good.
You, too.

06:33.927 --> 06:36.630
Mm.
So you're
the big chief now, huh?

06:36.730 --> 06:37.998
Yep.

06:38.098 --> 06:39.867
Of a town with a quarter
of the number of people

06:39.967 --> 06:41.802
in the East Village. Wow.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.671
So, not a lot of crime?
Well...

06:43.771 --> 06:45.773
Drunk driver,
missing dog,

06:45.873 --> 06:47.140
neighbor dispute,

06:47.240 --> 06:49.309
but not until
a couple weeks ago. Yeah.

06:49.409 --> 06:50.844
What's the story?

06:50.944 --> 06:55.248
A, uh, summer renter rented
a bungalow off of Main Street.

06:55.348 --> 06:57.184
Found strangled and posed.

06:57.284 --> 06:58.619
With rosary beads
and a biblical quote?

06:58.719 --> 07:01.321
"Vengeance is mine,
I will repay."

07:01.421 --> 07:02.990
Yeah, same MO as my guy.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.792
I'll take it from here.
Ah, no, no, no, no, no.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.293
I don't think so.

07:06.393 --> 07:09.563
You're the best detective
I've ever worked with, but...

07:09.663 --> 07:13.366
this guy is not the only one who
wants a little vengeance, so...

07:13.467 --> 07:14.635
we'll work it together.

07:14.735 --> 07:16.804
I'd love to.

07:18.539 --> 07:20.173
Hey, Baez.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.109
Looks like this isn't
a copycat killer after all.

07:22.209 --> 07:23.711
Why not?
Because I just

07:23.811 --> 07:25.012
talked to Bellehaven.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.481
Dr. Walker was released
three weeks ago.

07:55.743 --> 07:57.511
Yeah. And on the given day,

07:57.611 --> 08:00.748
dozens of cops tied up
in wrongful arrest allegations.

08:00.848 --> 08:02.215
Ah, we'd handle that, too.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.952
Mr. Mayor, you can't
just "handle" all of this.

08:05.052 --> 08:05.986
You can if you're me.

08:06.086 --> 08:07.921
I need proof.
I need facts.

08:08.021 --> 08:09.557
I need partners
who get on board.

08:09.657 --> 08:12.025
And I need partners
who look before they leap.

08:12.125 --> 08:13.694
I did look.

08:13.794 --> 08:14.962
I can't always factor in

08:15.062 --> 08:16.329
your litany of grievances
and excuses.

08:16.429 --> 08:19.032
The world moves
too fast for that.

08:19.132 --> 08:20.834
Late for the governor.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.903
Well, you're always late.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.838
Who is on board,
if you didn't know.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.473
We're not done yet.

08:26.574 --> 08:27.875
Yeah, we kind of are.

08:27.975 --> 08:29.610
I'll ride with you.

08:30.911 --> 08:32.145
How the hell did he get out?

08:32.245 --> 08:33.647
And why the hell
didn't you tell me?

08:33.747 --> 08:35.849
Uh, I have no idea what
you're talking about right now.

08:35.949 --> 08:37.384
Dr. Leonard Walker.

08:37.484 --> 08:38.986
The nutjob that killed
all those women.

08:39.086 --> 08:40.120
He's in Bellehaven.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.022
No, he <i>was</i> in Bellehaven.

08:42.122 --> 08:43.490
He got out three weeks ago,

08:43.591 --> 08:45.726
and now I got two more
dead women on my hands.

08:45.826 --> 08:47.995
I-I had no idea he was released.

08:48.095 --> 08:50.263
Oh, okay, fine, you didn't
know he was released.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.365
Can we at least
charge the guy now?

08:52.465 --> 08:54.134
With what? You have new evidence

08:54.234 --> 08:55.869
tying him to the recent murders?

08:55.969 --> 08:57.237
You mean besides
the lock of hair

08:57.337 --> 08:58.639
that he had in his possession?

08:58.739 --> 09:00.540
The one that didn't match
any of our victims?

09:00.641 --> 09:02.710
Well, what about
the rosary beads?
You have no prints,

09:02.810 --> 09:03.844
no evidence, okay?

09:03.944 --> 09:05.478
He bought rosary beads.

09:05.579 --> 09:07.781
You know how many Catholics
there are in New York City?

09:07.881 --> 09:09.249
You have nothing.

09:09.349 --> 09:11.451
He confessed to me
that he killed those women.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.486
In the waiting room
of a psych ward.

09:13.587 --> 09:14.688
And he recanted.

09:14.788 --> 09:16.089
It's your word against his.

09:16.189 --> 09:18.659
I have two more women
killed with the same MO.

09:18.759 --> 09:20.293
What the hell am I
supposed to do with that?

09:20.393 --> 09:22.830
You're supposed to get
some evidence, a witness,

09:22.930 --> 09:23.997
a signed confession,

09:24.097 --> 09:26.066
surveillance video, something.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.567
Something tangible.

09:27.668 --> 09:29.336
Hey.

09:29.436 --> 09:32.239
Erin, we just
picked up a guy--
I know, Tyler Green.

09:32.339 --> 09:34.007
And there's nothing I can do
to change it.

09:34.107 --> 09:35.575
I followed protocol.

09:35.676 --> 09:37.077
Meaning she's not in the mood
to help either of us.

09:37.177 --> 09:38.345
Are you kidding me?

09:38.445 --> 09:40.047
I am sick and tired
of the two of you

09:40.147 --> 09:41.882
feeling like you can
come up here any time

09:41.982 --> 09:44.151
and complain about what you
think is wrong with the system.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.252
So how about this?

09:45.352 --> 09:46.720
The revolving door is now shut.

09:46.820 --> 09:49.923
Go to any other ADA
with your complaints,

09:50.023 --> 09:51.458
but do not come to me.

09:58.198 --> 10:00.701
You can't ask
my cops to haul in

10:00.801 --> 10:04.604
an emotionally disturbed person
based on loopholes in city law.

10:04.705 --> 10:08.008
Do EDPs generally raise
obscure legal technicalities?

10:08.108 --> 10:12.345
Generally, they raise broken
bottles and hypodermic needles.

10:16.383 --> 10:17.918
Charlie, this detour
needs a detour of its own.

10:18.018 --> 10:18.986
Come on, move it.

10:19.086 --> 10:21.054
Get out of the city!

10:22.723 --> 10:23.891
Get out of the city!

10:23.991 --> 10:25.225
What are you doing here?

10:25.926 --> 10:27.227
Get out of here!

10:27.327 --> 10:28.662
Get off of me!

10:33.166 --> 10:34.634
Get off of me!

10:34.735 --> 10:36.704
You're nothing but trouble.

10:38.071 --> 10:39.606
Get off of him.

10:42.676 --> 10:44.978
And you want us
to round up that

10:45.078 --> 10:46.513
for sleeping in doorways?

10:46.613 --> 10:49.582
And you want some little
old lady to go up against that?

10:50.383 --> 10:51.919
You know what else
is way off here?

10:52.019 --> 10:53.821
How my NYPD driver rerouted

10:53.921 --> 10:56.757
to this particular nightmare
of an intersection.

10:56.857 --> 10:58.125
How he slowed to a crawl

10:58.225 --> 11:00.293
the second the light
turned yellow.

11:00.393 --> 11:02.095
How damn convenient this is

11:02.195 --> 11:04.031
for your little show-and-tell.

11:04.131 --> 11:06.366
You're saying I set this up?

11:06.466 --> 11:07.868
I wouldn't put it past you.

11:07.968 --> 11:09.770
And it didn't get past me.

11:09.870 --> 11:12.205
You're out of line, Mr. Mayor.

11:12.305 --> 11:13.640
If I am, I'll apologize.

11:13.741 --> 11:16.376
But I want this entire
incident investigated,

11:16.476 --> 11:19.546
reverse-engineered,
every single move.

11:28.722 --> 11:29.723
Hello, Mr. Walker.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.224
Doctor.

11:31.324 --> 11:33.026
That's right. My apologies.

11:33.126 --> 11:34.661
I forgot. You're a healer.

11:34.762 --> 11:37.030
I didn't have to come
in here, you know.

11:37.130 --> 11:38.131
No, you didn't.

11:38.231 --> 11:39.833
And I appreciate you coming in.

11:40.834 --> 11:42.169
I was thinking maybe
you could help me

11:42.269 --> 11:43.636
with two more murder victims.

11:43.737 --> 11:45.005
If I can.

11:45.105 --> 11:46.907
Great.

11:47.007 --> 11:49.042
The first
is Rosalie Gonzalez.

11:49.142 --> 11:51.511
Same MO as before. Strangled.

11:51.611 --> 11:52.746
Posed.

11:52.846 --> 11:54.047
Biblical quote.

11:54.147 --> 11:55.448
And what makes you think

11:55.548 --> 11:56.850
I'd know anything about that?

11:56.950 --> 11:58.819
She was missing a lock of hair.

12:02.923 --> 12:05.658
Next is Melinda Cohen.

12:05.759 --> 12:07.294
She was renting a home
on Long Island.

12:07.394 --> 12:11.464
Ooh, I do like the color
of her nail polish.

12:11.564 --> 12:12.665
Do you?

12:12.766 --> 12:14.301
I believe that's
called "ballet pink."

12:14.401 --> 12:16.436
Ballet pink... Hmm.

12:16.536 --> 12:19.206
You remember what you
told me before, Doc?

12:20.373 --> 12:22.342
You told me that you
killed them all.

12:22.442 --> 12:25.178
No, I don't recall that.

12:26.046 --> 12:27.314
Okay.

12:28.248 --> 12:32.719
With your expertise
and insight, maybe you can

12:32.820 --> 12:35.688
help me figure out who
the person was who did this.

12:35.789 --> 12:38.425
What makes you think
it's only one person?

12:40.360 --> 12:41.862
What are you talking about?

12:41.962 --> 12:44.331
Well, I'm just wondering if...

12:44.431 --> 12:46.433
it might be a team.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.669
A teacher and an apprentice.

12:50.938 --> 12:52.439
Who are you talking about?

12:54.041 --> 12:56.643
There is something called
doctor-patient confidentiality.

12:56.743 --> 12:58.611
Which goes out the window
when murder is involved.

12:58.711 --> 13:01.281
But I still wouldn't want
to betray anyone's confidence.

13:01.381 --> 13:02.315
That's fair.

13:02.415 --> 13:04.017
I can respect that.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.519
Maybe we could start
with just a first name.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.258
His name's Jeremy.

13:11.358 --> 13:12.592
Jeremy.

13:12.692 --> 13:14.061
Okay.

13:14.161 --> 13:16.396
Does Jeremy have a last name?

13:16.496 --> 13:18.065
I think I've said too much.

13:18.165 --> 13:19.399
I believe he'd be

13:19.499 --> 13:21.401
angry that I told.

13:21.501 --> 13:23.370
Maybe I could talk to Jeremy?

13:23.470 --> 13:25.305
You know, take you
out of the equation.

13:25.405 --> 13:27.807
You help me, I help you.

13:27.908 --> 13:29.542
No. That makes no sense.

13:29.642 --> 13:30.410
Why not?

13:30.510 --> 13:32.712
I don't need any help.

13:39.719 --> 13:40.487
Ms. Johnson?

13:40.587 --> 13:42.455
I'm ADA Erin Reagan.

13:42.555 --> 13:44.057
I was hoping to ask
you a few questions.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.592
Reagan?

13:45.692 --> 13:48.728
Aren't you the one who let
that animal go free?

13:48.828 --> 13:52.199
He was not set free,
he was placed in a program.

13:52.299 --> 13:54.935
And you have the nerve

13:55.035 --> 13:57.070
to come talk to me?

13:57.170 --> 13:58.538
Look at my face.

13:58.638 --> 14:01.541
I can't do much
unless you give me

14:01.641 --> 14:02.876
the details about what happened.

14:02.976 --> 14:04.344
What happened was

14:04.444 --> 14:07.780
he was arrested
for assaulting another woman,

14:07.881 --> 14:09.216
three weeks ago.

14:09.316 --> 14:11.784
And you let him loose
to do it again

14:11.885 --> 14:15.755
because you don't give a damn
about victims like me.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.125
I'm very sorry that
this happened to you--

14:18.225 --> 14:19.292
Get out!

14:19.392 --> 14:21.394
Get out!

14:24.664 --> 14:26.299
I can't talk
to you right now.

14:26.399 --> 14:27.867
But you can listen.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.469
I didn't mean
to set you off earlier.

14:29.569 --> 14:30.904
It's fine, forget it.

14:31.004 --> 14:34.041
Just want you to understand,
it was nothing personal.

14:34.141 --> 14:36.409
Right. "Nothing personal."

14:36.509 --> 14:39.046
You know, every week,
I sit at that table

14:39.146 --> 14:40.747
surrounded by cops.

14:40.847 --> 14:43.883
At this point, I'm the only one
not in the family business.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.953
And that's fine.
I... I'm fine with it.

14:46.053 --> 14:48.888
But it would be nice
if once in a while

14:48.989 --> 14:50.623
you guys realized
that these things hit me

14:50.723 --> 14:52.459
just as much
as they hit you.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.227
I know they do.
Right, but the difference is

14:54.327 --> 14:57.264
you have 35,000 brothers in blue

14:57.364 --> 14:59.332
who have your back
all the time,

14:59.432 --> 15:00.934
especially during tough times.

15:01.034 --> 15:01.969
I don't have that.

15:02.069 --> 15:04.271
I don't have a wall of ADAs

15:04.371 --> 15:06.773
standing up there beside
me to take the heat.

15:06.873 --> 15:09.309
So when my own
family piles it on,

15:09.409 --> 15:12.012
it gets a bit much.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.519
Look, I don't know what
you want me to tell you.

15:19.619 --> 15:21.388
Dr. Walker was released
because he was no longer

15:21.488 --> 15:23.590
a danger to himself or others.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.125
Why don't you tell
that to the two women

15:25.225 --> 15:26.759
he killed since
you let him out?

15:26.859 --> 15:28.761
Then why don't you
arrest him, Detective?

15:28.861 --> 15:30.297
All right.
Hold on a second, Doc.

15:30.397 --> 15:31.798
What if it was your
girlfriend, or your wife?

15:31.898 --> 15:33.400
Or your sister
or your mother?

15:33.500 --> 15:34.534
Would it be different
for you then?

15:34.634 --> 15:35.935
What do you want from me?

15:36.036 --> 15:37.737
He told me that some guy
Jeremy was the killer.

15:37.837 --> 15:40.273
Did he ever mention
this Jeremy to you?
Yes.

15:40.373 --> 15:41.674
Well, who the hell is Jeremy?

15:41.774 --> 15:44.344
Jeremy is Dr. Walker's
alternate identity.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.080
What are you talking about?

15:47.180 --> 15:49.616
Walker suffers from
Dissociative Identity Disorder.

15:49.716 --> 15:51.251
Multiple personalities?

15:51.351 --> 15:52.552
That's what it
used to be called.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.087
It's when you feel the presence

15:54.187 --> 15:56.856
of two or more people
talking and living in your head.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.458
So...?

15:58.558 --> 16:01.794
So, Jeremy, I'm afraid,
is Dr. Walker.

16:09.602 --> 16:11.738
You got to be kidding me.
I wish.

16:11.838 --> 16:13.206
'Fraid not, boss.

16:13.306 --> 16:14.574
How the hell...

16:14.674 --> 16:16.409
Cops' chat rooms
and forum threads

16:16.509 --> 16:19.712
blew up after the mayor's
appearance on that radio show.

16:19.812 --> 16:22.082
Mostly the usual
huffing and puffing.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.184
But there was someone
on the mayor's detail

16:24.284 --> 16:26.653
that put out word
when you got in his ride.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.021
But a decision was made

16:28.121 --> 16:31.391
to detour through
those specific blocks.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.793
Yeah.
Two homeless shelters,

16:33.893 --> 16:36.329
three liquor stores,
four weed shops

16:36.429 --> 16:37.930
and a methadone clinic,

16:38.031 --> 16:40.800
all within 100 feet
of that light.

16:40.900 --> 16:43.903
And the EDP was known
to the beat cops

16:44.003 --> 16:46.273
to be triggered
by official vehicles.

16:46.373 --> 16:49.909
There may have been some... encouragement.

16:50.977 --> 16:54.347
I wish all our cops
could be that resourceful.

16:54.447 --> 16:55.915
We got names.

16:57.050 --> 16:58.585
Of the officers involved.

16:58.685 --> 16:59.786
He gets that, Sid.

16:59.886 --> 17:01.721
Oh. You want 'em
up here forthwith?

17:01.821 --> 17:03.356
No.

17:03.456 --> 17:04.557
When, then?

17:04.657 --> 17:06.493
I don't.

17:07.827 --> 17:09.429
I've been PC
long enough to know

17:09.529 --> 17:13.100
the culture of this department
can only be seen as top-down.

17:13.200 --> 17:16.069
As stupid as that stunt was,

17:16.169 --> 17:18.738
I'm not throwing anybody
under the bus.

17:18.838 --> 17:21.474
I'll take the heat myself.

17:25.212 --> 17:27.180
How many more of these
do we have to do?

17:27.280 --> 17:29.349
Just two.

17:29.449 --> 17:30.883
Or three.

17:30.983 --> 17:33.486
<i>Ay, Dios mío.</i> What do you want?

17:33.586 --> 17:34.954
Alissa Martin?

17:35.054 --> 17:36.389
Depends.
You were assaulted
two months ago?

17:36.489 --> 17:38.024
Yeah. Where were you then?

17:38.125 --> 17:40.960
We have someone in custody we
think might be your attacker.

17:41.961 --> 17:42.862
We want you to come
down to precinct,

17:42.962 --> 17:44.063
sit with a detective,

17:44.164 --> 17:45.064
...look at a photo array,

17:45.165 --> 17:46.266
go over the case.

17:46.366 --> 17:47.734
I don't think so.

17:47.834 --> 17:49.369
Don't you want to find
the guy that assaulted you?

17:49.469 --> 17:51.371
Sure I do.
But let's say I cooperate.

17:51.471 --> 17:52.772
Then what? You arrest him

17:52.872 --> 17:54.174
and then he gets released
back onto the street

17:54.274 --> 17:55.642
and who do you think
he'll be looking for?

17:55.742 --> 17:56.776
The bitch that turned him in.

17:56.876 --> 17:58.211
No, thanks.

17:58.311 --> 17:59.879
How many more doors
do we need to get

17:59.979 --> 18:01.248
slammed in our face
before we decide

18:01.348 --> 18:02.549
to call it a day?

18:02.649 --> 18:04.117
Wait, don't you
think it's weird

18:04.217 --> 18:05.752
that she doesn't want
to help put the guy away?
No.

18:05.852 --> 18:07.019
Not in a
neighborhood like this.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.521
Did you see the tattoo
on her wrist?

18:08.621 --> 18:09.756
I didn't notice. Why?

18:09.856 --> 18:11.057
Louise Johnson had
the exact same one.

18:11.158 --> 18:12.992
What are the odds of that?

18:13.960 --> 18:15.328
Three blue stars.

18:15.428 --> 18:16.963
And according
to the gang unit,

18:17.063 --> 18:18.765
it's a common symbol for
the Flatbush Disciples.

18:18.865 --> 18:20.300
I'm not familiar with them.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.001
Well, they got their start
out at the projects

18:22.101 --> 18:23.503
in East Flatbush.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.972
Initiation into the gang
includes agreeing to a beatdown.

18:26.072 --> 18:27.507
You can't fight back,
you're supposed

18:27.607 --> 18:28.641
to just take your punches.

18:28.741 --> 18:30.510
Wait, you think our vic was...

18:30.610 --> 18:33.079
beaten up as a gang initiation?

18:33.180 --> 18:34.414
I don't know,
but it would explain

18:34.514 --> 18:36.216
why she wouldn't
cooperate with us.

18:36.316 --> 18:38.818
But she described her attacker.
Why would she do that?

18:38.918 --> 18:40.086
I don't know that, either.

18:40.187 --> 18:41.421
But who you know who else
is a member

18:41.521 --> 18:43.556
of the Flatbush Disciples?
Tyler Green.

18:50.563 --> 18:52.532
So the buck stops here.

18:53.400 --> 18:56.169
And... I'm very sorry.

18:57.437 --> 18:59.206
Thought you had
nothing to do with it.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.409
Like I said...

19:02.509 --> 19:03.576
Yeah, yeah.

19:03.676 --> 19:05.578
The buck stops there.

19:05.678 --> 19:07.980
What about the guilty cops?

19:08.080 --> 19:10.350
They are being dealt with.

19:10.450 --> 19:11.784
How?

19:11.884 --> 19:13.953
Commendations, a parade?

19:14.053 --> 19:17.190
Modified duty,
pending investigation.

19:17.290 --> 19:20.960
Your detail is being switched
out even as I speak.

19:21.060 --> 19:23.230
And if the allegations
are substantiated,

19:23.330 --> 19:25.398
they will be sent
back to patrol.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.700
You say that like
I'm supposed to salute you

19:27.800 --> 19:29.669
with tears in my eyes.

19:29.769 --> 19:31.938
Who the hell was involved?

19:33.873 --> 19:35.242
That is police business.

19:35.342 --> 19:37.176
It's also City Hall business.

19:37.277 --> 19:39.212
Some of your cops
put this city's mayor

19:39.312 --> 19:40.547
in physical jeopardy.

19:40.647 --> 19:45.184
It is an ongoing
internal investigation.

19:50.056 --> 19:51.924
Hmm.

19:53.626 --> 19:57.297
I'm dedicating a new intake
facility for our homeless

19:57.397 --> 20:01.468
and mentally challenged,
tomorrow afternoon.

20:02.369 --> 20:05.838
Either you join me
at the podium

20:05.938 --> 20:09.442
and sing my praises
like it's the national anthem...

20:10.977 --> 20:13.613
...or your cops
will be ferreted out

20:13.713 --> 20:16.015
and named to the press.

20:18.885 --> 20:21.321
Where's the buck stop, again?

20:23.456 --> 20:25.024
With me.

20:26.593 --> 20:28.961
Then I'll see you there.

20:46.279 --> 20:47.780
I knew I'd find you here.

20:47.880 --> 20:48.781
Ah...

20:48.881 --> 20:50.283
Don't tell Baez. Ha.

20:50.383 --> 20:52.519
She's the one that told me
to bring you the coffee.

20:52.619 --> 20:54.287
Mm.
So, you're not fooling
either of us.

20:54.387 --> 20:56.656
Mm, still Captain
Obvious, I guess.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.358
Yeah.

20:58.458 --> 20:59.659
All right,
so what's the plan?

20:59.759 --> 21:01.761
We're gonna sit in front
of this guy's house

21:01.861 --> 21:03.796
until he makes a mistake?
I'm just filling in
for the regular detail

21:03.896 --> 21:06.032
till they show up. Walker
didn't show up for work,

21:06.132 --> 21:08.134
I'm hoping he's inside.
That's it.

21:08.234 --> 21:10.403
I forgot how personally
you take your cases.

21:10.503 --> 21:13.172
If I remember correctly, you
take them pretty personal, too.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.308
Well, I guess now
maybe you lost that

21:15.408 --> 21:17.644
since you moved
to Suffolk County.

21:17.744 --> 21:19.078
No.

21:19.178 --> 21:20.447
I just mellowed.

21:20.547 --> 21:23.450
It's hard not to
when you realize

21:23.550 --> 21:26.052
there's a portion of the world
that cares if someone's pool

21:26.152 --> 21:28.588
is five feet
from the fence, but...

21:28.688 --> 21:30.690
that's the world
I want to live in.

21:31.458 --> 21:32.792
You know, you should try it.

21:32.892 --> 21:34.293
Yeah, maybe I will.

21:34.394 --> 21:36.195
After we nail
this son of a bitch.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.130
Seriously, the longer
he's out here,

21:38.230 --> 21:40.299
the more likely it is
he finds another victim.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.335
What about that, uh,
lock of hair we found?

21:42.435 --> 21:44.103
Don't know who it belongs to.

21:44.203 --> 21:45.872
Try Ancestry?
Don't have a match yet.

21:45.972 --> 21:47.774
One second.

21:47.874 --> 21:49.241
Reagan.

21:50.209 --> 21:51.611
What the hell
are you talking about?

21:51.711 --> 21:53.179
I'm sitting on his
house right now.

21:53.279 --> 21:55.482
Son of a bitch.

21:55.582 --> 21:57.817
Yeah, thank you.

21:57.917 --> 21:59.486
They found another victim.

22:00.587 --> 22:03.189
Welcome back, Jackie. Yeah.

22:16.969 --> 22:18.805
We got no comment!

22:18.905 --> 22:20.339
Thank you.

22:21.107 --> 22:23.042
You okay?

22:23.142 --> 22:24.811
Do you want a drink?

22:24.911 --> 22:26.813
Just want to forget
this whole thing happened.

22:26.913 --> 22:28.515
It'll all blow over soon.

22:28.615 --> 22:30.650
Well, not for Louise Johnson,
it won't.

22:30.750 --> 22:33.786
I mean, even if I can prove
that Tyler Green attacked her,

22:33.886 --> 22:36.823
her injuries didn't
cause permanent damage.

22:36.923 --> 22:38.525
So, without her cooperation,

22:38.625 --> 22:41.293
he's looking at... maybe a year?

22:42.361 --> 22:44.497
All because of me.

22:44.597 --> 22:46.165
How were you supposed
to know that Tyler Green

22:46.265 --> 22:47.434
was gonna go out
and attack someone?

22:47.534 --> 22:49.268
You don't have a crystal ball.

22:49.368 --> 22:52.204
Well, apparently, I don't
have good judgement, either.
Yeah, you do.

22:52.304 --> 22:53.873
You got great judgement.

22:53.973 --> 22:56.008
It was one mistake.

22:56.108 --> 22:57.710
And once this election is over,

22:57.810 --> 23:00.146
you're never gonna have to deal
with this kind of stuff anymore.

23:00.246 --> 23:02.381
How do you figure that?
Are you kidding?

23:02.482 --> 23:04.016
You're gonna be too busy

23:04.116 --> 23:06.185
wining and dining
and giving speeches

23:06.285 --> 23:09.589
and press conferences
and lobbying politicians.

23:09.689 --> 23:12.792
Well, I didn't think
of it that way. Absolutely.

23:12.892 --> 23:15.595
You're not gonna have time
to deal with victims anymore.

23:16.963 --> 23:18.865
And that's what you want, right?

23:22.268 --> 23:24.036
Yeah. Right.

23:24.804 --> 23:27.106
Cassandra Petsanas.
23 years old.

23:27.206 --> 23:29.341
Sitting on his house
for hours before you showed up.

23:29.442 --> 23:31.343
If he was there,
he couldn't have left.

23:31.444 --> 23:33.145
Maybe he went out the back.

23:33.245 --> 23:35.281
Looks like his phone pinged
about a half a mile from here,

23:35.381 --> 23:36.949
so he was in the vicinity.

23:37.049 --> 23:38.851
And then, after that,
we didn't get any signal.

23:38.951 --> 23:41.153
So he turns off his phone,
kills our vic and then what?

23:41.253 --> 23:43.022
Called the squad,
looking for you.

23:43.656 --> 23:45.224
He called the squad
looking for me?

23:45.324 --> 23:46.759
What the hell did he say?
The message was

23:46.859 --> 23:48.695
he saw you sitting
out front of his house

23:48.795 --> 23:51.197
and he just wanted
to wish you a good night.

24:05.111 --> 24:06.278
Your client is looking at

24:06.378 --> 24:08.515
assault one
and attempted murder.

24:08.615 --> 24:09.916
That's five to 25.

24:10.016 --> 24:11.884
If he pleads, I can offer ten.

24:11.984 --> 24:13.553
Let's not waste each
other's time, Erin.

24:13.653 --> 24:15.187
I know that Louise Johnson isn't
cooperating with your office.

24:15.287 --> 24:17.524
Your client stomped
on the victim.

24:17.624 --> 24:19.859
Well, has your victim given
a statement to that effect?

24:19.959 --> 24:21.828
I didn't think so.

24:21.928 --> 24:22.895
Even if you brought
this to trial,

24:22.995 --> 24:24.430
you don't have enough to win.

24:24.531 --> 24:26.165
Frankly, you don't even have
enough for an indictment.

24:26.265 --> 24:28.701
Louise Johnson
will be cooperating.

24:28.801 --> 24:30.837
Assault three. Six months.

24:30.937 --> 24:32.338
Take it or leave it.

24:32.438 --> 24:35.107
I'll take my chances
with the jury. Fine.

24:35.207 --> 24:38.778
Good luck telling the victim
that you screwed her over twice.

24:45.585 --> 24:46.819
We got a match
from the hair.

24:46.919 --> 24:49.221
Miriam Walker,
66 years old.

24:49.321 --> 24:51.423
She went missing
seven years ago.

24:51.524 --> 24:53.225
Miriam Walker...

24:53.325 --> 24:56.529
Like as in Dr. Walker's mom?
Looks that way.

24:56.629 --> 24:58.865
She was living in the house
with him when she went missing.

24:58.965 --> 25:00.032
He probably killed her.

25:00.132 --> 25:01.901
We don't have a body.

25:02.001 --> 25:04.303
That's how
we're gonna catch him.

25:04.403 --> 25:06.873
How?
We're gonna play his game.

25:08.507 --> 25:11.978
My lawyer told me not to talk
to you without her present.

25:12.078 --> 25:14.480
Yeah, she told me
she'll be here any minute.

25:14.581 --> 25:15.748
Hmm.
We can wait.

25:15.848 --> 25:17.984
I think we should. Great.

25:29.796 --> 25:31.330
What have you got there?

25:31.430 --> 25:34.266
Did you know human hair can last
a very long time like this--

25:34.366 --> 25:37.737
in a plastic bag--
before it decomposes?

25:37.837 --> 25:38.971
That's not yours.

25:39.071 --> 25:41.273
No, it's not. It's actually...

25:41.373 --> 25:42.642
your mother's.

25:42.742 --> 25:45.244
That's what
the DNA test said.

25:45.344 --> 25:46.746
Miriam Walker.

25:46.846 --> 25:48.648
Well, she's been missing
for a long time.

25:48.748 --> 25:50.016
What are you saying?

25:50.116 --> 25:52.051
You know,
in the Victorian times,

25:52.151 --> 25:54.887
people would take
a lock of hair like this

25:54.987 --> 25:56.255
as a sign of affection

25:56.355 --> 25:58.791
or to preserve
someone's memory.

25:58.891 --> 26:00.660
Which one was it for you, Doc?

26:00.760 --> 26:02.695
I know what you're doing.

26:02.795 --> 26:04.496
Do you?

26:06.633 --> 26:08.835
You and I, we're...

26:08.935 --> 26:11.070
...we're not
that different.

26:11.170 --> 26:12.905
Actually,
we're very different.

26:13.005 --> 26:15.241
You like to murder
innocent young women,

26:15.341 --> 26:16.442
and I don't.

26:16.542 --> 26:19.679
But you see yourself
as an avenger.

26:19.779 --> 26:21.013
Am I right?

26:21.113 --> 26:24.817
I'd like to ask Jeremy
what he thinks.

26:24.917 --> 26:26.653
He doesn't talk to strangers.

26:26.753 --> 26:27.954
Then maybe
you should ask him

26:28.054 --> 26:29.121
where the hell he was yesterday

26:29.221 --> 26:31.090
between the hours
of 6:30 and 8:30.

26:31.190 --> 26:34.026
Jeremy is unavailable
at this time.

26:34.126 --> 26:35.194
Then where the hell were you

26:35.294 --> 26:36.495
between the hours
of 6:30 and 8:30?

26:36.595 --> 26:37.997
I was home watching you

26:38.097 --> 26:39.966
sitting outside my house.

26:43.602 --> 26:45.271
I have to leave now.

26:46.205 --> 26:47.606
We're not finished.

26:47.707 --> 26:52.178
I'm sorry, but I have a lot
of work left to do.

26:52.278 --> 26:54.480
Follow me this way.

26:58.651 --> 26:59.952
I got nothing from him.

27:00.052 --> 27:01.453
I have some good news.

27:01.553 --> 27:03.690
Apparently, Walker's mother
had a house in Mattituck

27:03.790 --> 27:05.591
registered in her maiden name.

27:05.692 --> 27:07.026
Jackie's securing a warrant.

27:07.126 --> 27:08.194
Great. Do you want
to take a ride?
Yeah.

27:08.294 --> 27:10.429
Of course.
Let's go.

27:20.439 --> 27:22.508
I already told you,
I'm not giving a statement.

27:22.608 --> 27:25.077
so why can't you
just leave me alone?

27:25.177 --> 27:26.713
Because we think you haven't
told us the whole truth.

27:26.813 --> 27:28.147
Now I'm a liar?

27:28.247 --> 27:30.549
Your tattoo is from
the Flatbush Disciples.

27:30.649 --> 27:32.051
So?

27:32.151 --> 27:33.853
So maybe you got assaulted
as part of a gang initiation.

27:33.953 --> 27:35.621
Oh, my God.

27:35.722 --> 27:37.156
Look, we're just trying to help.

27:37.256 --> 27:39.591
You're accusing me of lying
about being attacked.

27:40.392 --> 27:42.729
You're basically telling me
I asked to get beat up

27:42.829 --> 27:45.131
so I could become part
of the Flatbush Disciples.

27:45.231 --> 27:46.398
Really?
You tell us.

27:46.498 --> 27:47.934
We're out there busting our ass

27:48.034 --> 27:49.301
trying to bring Tyler Green
to justice

27:49.401 --> 27:50.937
and you're doing absolutely
nothing to help.

27:51.037 --> 27:52.739
I'm not trying
to protect myself.

27:52.839 --> 27:54.673
I'm trying to protect my son.

27:54.774 --> 27:56.475
Then tell us the truth.

27:57.710 --> 27:59.311
We can help you with that.

28:00.446 --> 28:01.948
I...

28:02.048 --> 28:05.217
...didn't get beat up because
I trying to get into a gang.

28:06.385 --> 28:09.989
I got beat up because
I wanted to get out of it.

28:11.791 --> 28:14.160
What happened when you
asked to leave the gang?

28:14.260 --> 28:16.028
Tyler Green told me the only way

28:16.128 --> 28:18.297
someone can leave the gang
is in a body bag.

28:27.539 --> 28:29.508
...and the spirit
of our gathering today

28:29.608 --> 28:32.411
comes right from Emma Lazarus'
beautiful sonnet

28:32.511 --> 28:35.347
inscribed on our
Statue of Liberty.

28:35.447 --> 28:39.551
We welcome not only
"your tired, your poor,

28:39.651 --> 28:42.121
your huddled masses yearning
to breathe free"...

28:42.221 --> 28:45.758
So if you give in to
blackmail, is it a sin?

28:45.858 --> 28:47.860
Hmm. I'm not sure.

28:47.960 --> 28:49.261
Well, say it is.

28:49.361 --> 28:52.932
So if you defy blackmail,
is it a virtue?

28:53.032 --> 28:55.701
Again, I'm not sure.

28:55.802 --> 28:57.736
...proud
New Yorkers welcome

28:57.837 --> 29:00.739
your marginalized,
your disenfranchised,

29:00.840 --> 29:03.843
your mentally
and emotionally challenged

29:03.943 --> 29:06.846
yearning to be
safe and warm,

29:06.946 --> 29:09.581
fed and cared for.

29:13.986 --> 29:16.956
I'm honored that my partner
in Mission: Open Arms

29:17.056 --> 29:18.590
could be with us today.

29:20.726 --> 29:23.762
Please welcome
Commissioner Frank Reagan.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.535
Thank you, Mr. Mayor,

29:29.635 --> 29:31.237
and thank you,
Commissioner Reagan,

29:31.337 --> 29:33.405
for so graciously
offering up your time

29:33.505 --> 29:36.075
so that I might celebrate

29:36.175 --> 29:37.776
and bless this...

29:37.877 --> 29:39.545
wonderful partnership.

29:42.882 --> 29:45.617
We're all God's children,

29:45.717 --> 29:48.187
but in the warp and woof
of the daily grind,

29:48.287 --> 29:52.158
we sometimes forget to recognize
and embrace that.

29:53.359 --> 29:56.095
But today, here...

29:56.195 --> 29:58.130
the mayor...

29:58.230 --> 29:59.665
and the commissioner...

29:59.765 --> 30:03.335
have brought us together
in harmony.

30:13.312 --> 30:15.547
With all due respect,
Your Eminence--

30:15.647 --> 30:17.683
Which always means disrespect
is about to follow.

30:17.783 --> 30:19.818
I am the mayor,
on the mayor's schedule.

30:19.919 --> 30:22.421
And I'll be brief
if you'll just be quiet.

30:23.722 --> 30:27.693
Now, a person walks
down the block

30:27.793 --> 30:29.828
and the crowds part
and the men tip their hats

30:29.929 --> 30:32.031
and the women curtsy

30:32.131 --> 30:33.832
and a stranger
in this town

30:33.933 --> 30:36.202
asks, "Who is that person?"

30:36.302 --> 30:38.737
What town are we in?

30:39.939 --> 30:42.341
Well, the answer is never,

30:42.441 --> 30:44.576
"Oh, he's the commissioner
of this place"

30:44.676 --> 30:46.545
or "He's the archbishop
of this place."

30:46.645 --> 30:50.416
No, the answer is always,
"He's the <i>mayor</i> of this place."

30:53.519 --> 30:57.356
He's the mayor of this place
and he deserves your respect.

30:57.456 --> 30:59.258
Hmm?

31:00.893 --> 31:02.995
How long have you been
in office? Three years?

31:03.095 --> 31:04.830
Three and a half.
Uh-huh.

31:04.931 --> 31:08.167
He's been rising through
the ranks of the NYPD

31:08.267 --> 31:10.302
since he was 22 years old.

31:12.638 --> 31:15.474
He's forgotten more
about policing this city

31:15.574 --> 31:17.676
than you'll ever learn
about being its mayor.

31:17.776 --> 31:18.945
He's a professional

31:19.045 --> 31:20.479
and as best as they come,

31:20.579 --> 31:23.149
and he deserves your respect.

31:27.386 --> 31:31.823
The uncompromising leader
always goes it alone.

31:32.591 --> 31:34.793
And the people he leads
always lose

31:34.893 --> 31:37.229
and suffer because of it.

31:38.164 --> 31:40.399
Start leading together

31:40.499 --> 31:42.701
and save your
political grandstanding

31:42.801 --> 31:44.836
for the bathroom mirror.

31:44.937 --> 31:46.705
Huh?

31:46.805 --> 31:48.407
Now shake hands.

31:51.277 --> 31:53.345
I mean it.

32:18.437 --> 32:20.606
He's upstairs. Okay.

32:20.706 --> 32:22.441
Uh, you know, I'm gonna head
down to the basement.

32:22.541 --> 32:23.976
Sounds good.

32:27.980 --> 32:29.448
Anything?

32:29.548 --> 32:31.150
Yeah, there's food
in the fridge,

32:31.250 --> 32:32.818
electricity's been
turned on.

32:32.918 --> 32:34.686
Somebody has definitely
been using this place.

32:34.786 --> 32:36.788
All right.
Let's keep looking.

32:38.924 --> 32:41.260
Danny, neighbor said
she saw him two days ago.

32:41.360 --> 32:43.695
All right. I haven't
checked the garage yet.

32:43.795 --> 32:46.498
You know what?
Get the cadaver dog.

32:53.105 --> 32:55.107
Let's do a once-over.

32:55.207 --> 32:56.142
Search.

32:56.242 --> 32:58.477
Search.

33:03.349 --> 33:05.184
Looks like we got
a hit here, Detective.

33:05.284 --> 33:06.218
In the wall?
Yes.

33:06.318 --> 33:07.553
All right, step out.

33:13.259 --> 33:15.461
Yeah, let's get that open.

33:31.077 --> 33:32.911
I think we found
his mother.

33:42.288 --> 33:43.189
Oh.

33:43.289 --> 33:44.756
Wow. What are you doing here?

33:44.856 --> 33:47.326
Uh, not exactly 35,000,
but not bad, right?

33:47.426 --> 33:50.429
Think of us as your
brotherhood of justice.

33:50.529 --> 33:51.530
And sisterhood.

33:51.630 --> 33:53.299
Not sure where
that leaves me.

33:54.266 --> 33:56.068
And what are you doing here?

33:56.168 --> 33:58.637
I heard that, uh, we were
forming a support group,

33:58.737 --> 34:00.672
and I wanted to support you.

34:00.772 --> 34:02.208
So, don't
leave us hanging,

34:02.308 --> 34:03.642
did you get
the indictment?

34:03.742 --> 34:05.744
The jury voted to indict

34:05.844 --> 34:07.113
Tyler Green.

34:07.946 --> 34:09.581
Two counts of attempted murder,

34:09.681 --> 34:10.849
one count of assault.

34:10.949 --> 34:12.684
That is fantastic. Yep.

34:12.784 --> 34:13.985
Great investigative work.

34:14.086 --> 34:15.354
I couldn't have done it
without you.

34:15.454 --> 34:16.755
All right,
so what do you say

34:16.855 --> 34:18.524
we go out for a drink
to celebrate?

34:18.624 --> 34:19.758
Yeah.
Great. You buying?

34:19.858 --> 34:21.327
Yes.

34:21.427 --> 34:22.928
And we're gonna go
out that way

34:23.028 --> 34:24.930
because there's
reporters that way.

34:26.898 --> 34:28.500
All right. Great.

34:36.175 --> 34:37.176
I would like
to make a statement.

34:37.276 --> 34:38.977
Uh, I'm sure you're all hearing

34:39.077 --> 34:40.612
just about now that
we got an indictment

34:40.712 --> 34:43.081
in the Tyler Green case,
thanks to the testimony

34:43.182 --> 34:45.784
of multiple victims,
including Louise Johnson.

34:46.618 --> 34:48.587
He will be arraigned
in Supreme Court

34:48.687 --> 34:51.823
and is looking at 25 years
if convicted.

34:51.923 --> 34:54.493
So justice was served.
Today, at least.

34:54.593 --> 34:58.130
Um, recent events have
clarified a few things for me,

34:58.230 --> 35:01.500
so I want to address
the question of...

35:01.600 --> 35:03.969
when I will be announcing
officially my run

35:04.069 --> 35:05.637
for Manhattan District Attorney.

35:05.737 --> 35:07.706
And the answer to that is:

35:07.806 --> 35:09.508
not this time around.

35:11.643 --> 35:13.379
I believe I am where
I need to be

35:13.479 --> 35:15.681
and where I will do
the most good.

35:15.781 --> 35:17.015
And, uh...

35:17.115 --> 35:19.651
right now,
it's as simple as that.

35:19.751 --> 35:21.119
Just a quick question.

35:21.220 --> 35:22.554
So, thank you.

35:25.023 --> 35:26.658
You ready to celebrate?

35:26.758 --> 35:30.061
Wow, you are full
of surprises today.

35:30.162 --> 35:32.130
well, you ain't seen
nothing yet.

35:49.748 --> 35:51.016
How was your vacation?

35:51.116 --> 35:53.084
Wonderful.

35:53.185 --> 35:55.187
Where'd you go?

35:55.287 --> 35:57.923
Knicks at the Garden,
Hopper at the Whitney

35:58.023 --> 36:00.526
and take-out on my couch.

36:02.528 --> 36:06.432
With a stop at
St. Patrick's Cathedral?

36:08.700 --> 36:10.269
Why would I do that?

36:11.470 --> 36:13.305
Because real leaders
have a compass

36:13.405 --> 36:16.007
and yours directed you there.

36:22.681 --> 36:24.149
He tell you?

36:25.083 --> 36:26.985
No.

36:27.085 --> 36:28.754
Just a wild guess.

36:31.257 --> 36:32.591
You need a wingman,

36:32.691 --> 36:35.694
whether you know it or not
or like it or not.

36:37.062 --> 36:39.164
If you say so.

36:40.399 --> 36:42.067
Plus, Kearns has God
backing him up.

36:42.167 --> 36:44.770
So you had to listen, being you.

36:47.606 --> 36:48.374
Dinner?

36:48.474 --> 36:49.975
Only if you're buying.

36:50.075 --> 36:52.711
Elio's, 7:30.

36:54.145 --> 36:55.581
See you there.

36:59.251 --> 37:01.520
We're done here.
Let's head back to the city.

37:01.620 --> 37:03.955
Good. I don't want
to leave Elena for so long.

37:04.055 --> 37:05.291
I don't blame you.

37:05.391 --> 37:06.692
Jackie said the
license plate readers

37:06.792 --> 37:08.760
didn't track Walker's
car down here.

37:08.860 --> 37:10.962
Well, he hasn't made it back
to his place in the city.

37:11.062 --> 37:13.098
What about his phone?
His phone's off.

37:13.198 --> 37:14.400
Detectives?

37:14.500 --> 37:15.767
I'm looking for Chief Curatola?

37:15.867 --> 37:17.336
She left a little
while ago. What's up?

37:17.436 --> 37:18.937
I think we found something
worth looking at.

37:19.037 --> 37:20.306
May I?

37:27.346 --> 37:29.180
He wore a Con Electric uniform.

37:30.716 --> 37:33.184
That's how he got the girls
to let him in their place.

37:33.285 --> 37:34.986
He wore
a Con Electric uniform.

37:43.128 --> 37:45.063
Damn.

37:46.231 --> 37:47.333
Danny.

37:47.433 --> 37:48.867
We figured out how
he tricked the--

37:48.967 --> 37:50.168
Listen, let me call you back.
My lights just went out.

37:50.268 --> 37:51.503
The-- Your l--

37:52.237 --> 37:53.472
Jackie? Hello?

38:03.315 --> 38:04.716
Oh!

38:05.183 --> 38:06.518
We got to go.

38:09.154 --> 38:10.922
Ow!

38:31.209 --> 38:32.378
I'll take the front,
you go around the side.

38:32.478 --> 38:34.380
You got it.

38:42.287 --> 38:43.622
Jack?

38:43.722 --> 38:44.890
Jackie?

38:46.925 --> 38:47.926
Hey.

38:48.026 --> 38:49.060
Yeah.
You okay?

38:49.160 --> 38:50.362
Yeah.
Where is he? Where's Walker?

38:50.462 --> 38:52.197
I don't know. But he left.
Danny?

38:52.297 --> 38:53.432
Hey! Take care of her. Yeah.

38:53.532 --> 38:55.100
I'm going after Walker.

38:56.234 --> 38:57.703
You okay?

39:13.184 --> 39:14.653
Damn it.

39:14.753 --> 39:17.222
He's in the wind, but he's
running out of places to go.

39:17.322 --> 39:19.491
Yeah. Well, if you
hear anything...

39:19.591 --> 39:21.326
You'll be the first call. Same.

39:21.427 --> 39:22.928
Got to admit,

39:23.028 --> 39:25.263
it feels like old times
working with you again, Jack.

39:25.363 --> 39:29.334
Yeah. Brought back everything
I hate about the job.

39:29.435 --> 39:31.570
Yeah, I bet.
But everything I...

39:31.670 --> 39:34.740
I love about
working with you. Same.

39:36.742 --> 39:38.143
But you don't miss
any of it at all?

39:38.243 --> 39:39.978
I mean, besides
working with me?
You?

39:40.078 --> 39:41.980
Yes, I miss you.

39:42.080 --> 39:43.982
But, no, the city?
No, no.

39:44.082 --> 39:45.651
Yeah.
Not even a little bit.

39:45.751 --> 39:47.853
Because...
I don't know,

39:47.953 --> 39:50.756
I finally...
I found my happy place.

39:50.856 --> 39:51.723
Yeah, you did.

39:51.823 --> 39:53.291
And I think you should, too.

39:53.391 --> 39:55.794
I have.

39:55.894 --> 39:58.229
Yeah, I could tell.

39:58.329 --> 39:59.397
But if I ever need
a change of pace,

39:59.498 --> 40:00.732
I'll be knocking on that door

40:00.832 --> 40:02.801
with a six-pack
and a bottle of red wine.

40:02.901 --> 40:04.803
I'd like that.

40:04.903 --> 40:07.338
Me, too. You take care.

40:24.055 --> 40:25.857
You ready?
Yeah.

40:27.258 --> 40:29.260
You okay?
Mm-hmm.

40:29.360 --> 40:31.229
Yeah, I'm...

40:31.329 --> 40:32.798
right where I want to be.

40:46.177 --> 40:47.646
Do you really
feel like that?

40:47.746 --> 40:49.681
Like where you are is exactly
where you want to be?

40:49.781 --> 40:50.849
I do.

40:50.949 --> 40:53.218
Turns out,
the bluebird of happiness

40:53.318 --> 40:54.586
was in my own backyard.

40:54.686 --> 40:55.887
So you're
saying putting

40:55.987 --> 40:57.222
dirtbags behind bars

40:57.322 --> 40:58.957
is the bluebird
of your happiness?

40:59.057 --> 41:00.592
For me, it is, yeah, mm-hmm.

41:00.692 --> 41:01.993
What about the rest of you?

41:02.093 --> 41:04.029
Well, it definitely is for me,
too, sad to say.

41:04.129 --> 41:05.664
Me, too.
Me three.

41:05.764 --> 41:06.665
Me four.

41:06.765 --> 41:08.433
I am sorry that you, and Jack,

41:08.534 --> 41:09.835
came all the way home

41:09.935 --> 41:12.237
for my non-announcement.

41:12.337 --> 41:14.105
Well, sorry not sorry.

41:14.205 --> 41:17.643
It filled this table for
the first time in a long time.

41:18.877 --> 41:20.211
I miss this.

41:20.311 --> 41:22.981
Trust me, I trust you guys
more than you miss me.

41:24.215 --> 41:25.617
I second that.

41:25.717 --> 41:27.619
You realized that you
just seconded that...

41:27.719 --> 41:29.120
we don't miss you very much.

41:29.220 --> 41:30.255
Shut up.

41:30.355 --> 41:31.389
Already?

41:31.489 --> 41:33.358
Music to my ears.

41:34.292 --> 41:37.228
I'm even more proud of you than
if you'd run for office and won.

41:37.328 --> 41:38.630
Thank you.

41:38.730 --> 41:39.831
You would've
never lasted, though.

41:39.931 --> 41:41.199
DA's a political office.

41:41.299 --> 41:43.569
Totally different species
of shark than you.

41:43.669 --> 41:44.770
Hmm.

41:44.870 --> 41:46.104
I think he meant that
as a compliment.

41:46.204 --> 41:47.673
Okay, yeah.

41:47.773 --> 41:49.440
Well, you know the PC
has to play in politics, too.

41:49.541 --> 41:50.709
You saying he's a shark?

41:50.809 --> 41:52.277
I'd say he's more bull
than shark.

41:52.377 --> 41:53.478
Lone wolf.

41:53.579 --> 41:55.146
Every mayor's white whale.

41:55.246 --> 41:57.315
All of the above.

41:58.584 --> 42:00.552
Hey, I'm just your
humble civil servant

42:00.652 --> 42:03.421
trying to get along
with everybody.

42:06.124 --> 42:07.926
And again...

42:08.026 --> 42:10.528
I can't tell you
how good it feels to...

42:10.629 --> 42:13.832
have the whole
peanut gallery here today.

42:20.471 --> 42:22.140
Who wants to say grace?

42:22.240 --> 42:24.475
Under the circumstances,

42:24.576 --> 42:26.812
I think it should be
a group effort.

42:26.912 --> 42:28.413
There you go.

42:31.983 --> 42:34.786
Bless us, O Lord,
and these thy gifts

42:34.886 --> 42:37.756
which we are about to receive
from thy bounty

42:37.856 --> 42:40.692
through Christ our Lord. Amen.

42:43.394 --> 42:44.562
Okay.
Okay.
