00:02.013 --> 00:03.905
Previously
on Being Mary Jane...

00:03.944 --> 00:06.600
The Gifting Alliance? How did
you manage to get an invite?

00:06.621 --> 00:08.127
Because I'm Paul
Patterson, hater.

00:08.150 --> 00:10.174
I just don't understand
how one minute

00:10.181 --> 00:11.977
you're twirling mattress
signs on the corner,

00:12.001 --> 00:13.595
and then the next,
you're being invited

00:13.602 --> 00:15.340
to elite millionaire
investment meetings.

00:15.356 --> 00:18.137
There is no "We." There's
you, and then there's me.

00:18.160 --> 00:19.690
I want to be involved
with Treyvion.

00:19.700 --> 00:21.755
Treyvion doesn't know you.
You left.

00:21.779 --> 00:24.365
You should go through the
process of freezing your eggs.

00:24.388 --> 00:28.107
It's a follicle stimulating
hormone injection,

00:28.117 --> 00:30.190
and you'll give
it to yourself.

00:30.200 --> 00:32.940
Then why can't we just take
a beat and talk about it?

00:32.950 --> 00:34.232
Just give me the damn shot.

00:34.242 --> 00:37.492
I don't need a lecture or a
diagnosis from you. Just the shot.

00:37.511 --> 00:39.148
I want to make sure
you're doing this for you

00:39.158 --> 00:40.856
and not some one-up to David.

00:40.866 --> 00:41.981
You know what? Never mind.

00:41.991 --> 00:43.357
I'll do it myself. Thank you.

00:43.367 --> 00:44.690
My sister
was telling me

00:44.700 --> 00:46.571
that three of her
girlfriends are doing it.

00:46.602 --> 00:49.148
It's like the modern day
woman's insurance policy.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:26.400 --> 01:29.973
Today's woman continues to be
educated and career-focused,

01:29.983 --> 01:32.973
waiting longer and longer
to start a family.

01:32.983 --> 01:35.390
And while there's still
no time machine,

01:35.400 --> 01:36.973
modern technology is proving

01:36.983 --> 01:39.640
to have a jump on
slowing down the clock.

01:39.650 --> 01:41.849
In fact, just two years ago,

01:41.859 --> 01:45.181
egg freezing was still
considered experimental.

01:45.191 --> 01:47.724
Now it's a standard within
the fertility community.

01:47.734 --> 01:52.181
SNC's own Mary Jane Paul has
bravely taken on the journey,

01:52.191 --> 01:53.807
and she is back for a checkup

01:53.817 --> 01:57.015
with Dr. Jacob Marrs,
renowned fertility expert

01:57.025 --> 01:59.973
and director of the Oocyte
Cryopreservation Center.

01:59.983 --> 02:01.724
Mary Jane?

02:01.734 --> 02:03.056
Yes, I am back.

02:03.066 --> 02:04.390
I don't know how easy it is,

02:04.400 --> 02:05.973
but I'm back.

02:05.983 --> 02:08.056
Actually, Dr. Marrs,
it was fairly easy

02:08.066 --> 02:09.139
except for the needles--

02:09.150 --> 02:10.556
Hello?
- Lisa, are you seeing this?

02:10.567 --> 02:12.181
Yes, Aunt
Helen, I'm watching.

02:12.191 --> 02:13.973
To increase your
egg production.

02:13.983 --> 02:15.473
By next week, it'll be
out of your system.

02:15.483 --> 02:17.432
You won't be able to blame
any mood swings on me.

02:17.442 --> 02:19.390
Oh, but I will.

02:19.400 --> 02:21.973
So I'm here today because I'm at
the end of my hormone regimen

02:21.983 --> 02:23.765
and you are measuring
my follicles.

02:23.775 --> 02:26.682
Exactly. I'm measuring
and counting.

02:26.692 --> 02:30.515
You see, removing the eggs
is a delicate process,

02:30.525 --> 02:33.015
and timing is everything.

02:33.025 --> 02:35.098
If we take them out too soon,

02:35.108 --> 02:36.307
they might not be ready.

02:36.317 --> 02:37.807
But leave them in too long,

02:37.817 --> 02:39.973
and the eggs might
expire, if you will,

02:39.983 --> 02:41.140
and then they're useless.

02:41.150 --> 02:42.765
It's an imprecise science,

02:42.775 --> 02:44.557
but we like to see
about ten follicles.

02:44.567 --> 02:46.015
If they're of good size,

02:46.025 --> 02:48.098
we can be confident that
we'll get the eggs we need,

02:48.108 --> 02:49.849
and an ultrasound is the
best way to get a picture

02:49.859 --> 02:52.348
of what we've
got, so legs up.

02:52.358 --> 02:54.432
Oh, goodness, I can
hear my mother now.

02:54.442 --> 02:56.181
"What are you doing?

02:56.191 --> 02:58.724
What are you doing?"

02:58.734 --> 03:01.265
Take a deep breath and relax.

03:01.275 --> 03:03.473
Whoo, okay.

03:03.483 --> 03:06.390
I w as hoping for a little
wine and roses before,

03:06.400 --> 03:10.432
but I'm sure my
follicles are huge,

03:10.442 --> 03:12.015
because I picked up a
little extra weight

03:12.025 --> 03:13.390
around my waistline.

03:13.400 --> 03:16.473
I see three-- no,
four follicles.

03:16.483 --> 03:18.223
Quality over quantity, right?

03:21.525 --> 03:23.515
Doctor?

03:25.650 --> 03:29.140
Mary Jane, it's not what
we were hoping for.

03:29.150 --> 03:33.307
They're measuring, I would
say, on average 6 millimeters.

03:33.317 --> 03:37.140
That's far short of what I
expect to see at this stage.

03:37.150 --> 03:38.640
Okay.

03:38.650 --> 03:40.432
What are you telling me?

03:40.442 --> 03:42.432
This is abnormal,

03:42.442 --> 03:44.765
but you can always try again.

03:47.859 --> 03:49.390
Kara, don't
let her drown.

03:49.400 --> 03:51.223
Throw it back to me.

03:54.817 --> 03:58.265
Mary Jane, wrap it up.

03:58.275 --> 04:00.557
We'll be right back
in just a second.

04:00.567 --> 04:01.973
You're out.

04:01.983 --> 04:03.015
Commercial up.

04:04.525 --> 04:06.223
Kara, what
are you doing?

04:06.233 --> 04:08.181
Just stand by. I'll let
you know what's going on.

04:08.191 --> 04:10.056
Going back to
Mary Jane-- confirm?

04:10.066 --> 04:11.432
Hold on. Wait for instructions.
Hold on.

04:11.442 --> 04:13.557
Oh my God. What went wrong?

04:13.567 --> 04:15.056
Huh? What went wrong?

04:15.066 --> 04:17.223
Could I have taken
the medicine wrong?

04:17.233 --> 04:19.640
I mean, you said
38 isn't old-old.

04:19.649 --> 04:22.973
God, could it be
my sexual history?

04:22.983 --> 04:24.515
Could I have
damaged something?

04:24.525 --> 04:26.557
It could be a
myriad of reasons.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.849
I did have tequila
and not just wine.

04:28.859 --> 04:31.390
It could be as simple as
adjusting your hormone dosage.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.015
Okay, how do I fix it?

04:33.025 --> 04:35.307
I am supposed to extract
for Friday's newscast.

04:35.317 --> 04:38.140
I'm supposed to
have eggs, okay?

04:38.150 --> 04:40.682
I would advise against
extraction given your condition.

04:40.692 --> 04:43.682
Oh--condition. Great. I am not
supposed to have a condition.

04:43.692 --> 04:45.390
I'm referring to your eggs.

04:45.400 --> 04:47.056
They aren't in the
ideal condition.

04:47.066 --> 04:48.557
If we do extract--

04:51.734 --> 04:53.307
No.

04:53.317 --> 04:56.724
If done successfully, that
wouldn't have an impact.

04:56.734 --> 04:59.390
Let's not jump to any
conclusions, all right?

04:59.400 --> 05:01.765
I would advise you to do
another cycle of hormones

05:01.775 --> 05:03.098
at a higher dosage,

05:03.108 --> 05:05.599
give us another shot
at that perfect egg.

05:05.609 --> 05:07.181
I bet you can do it.
- 50 seconds.

05:07.191 --> 05:08.973
Along with additional
lifestyle support,

05:08.983 --> 05:10.973
I would expect we
can get there.

05:13.692 --> 05:16.973
And what if they
don't get better?

05:16.983 --> 05:19.599
Kara, Kara,
I can handle this.

05:19.609 --> 05:20.849
Just let me know
what we're doing.

05:20.859 --> 05:23.223
No, no, no, no, no.

05:23.233 --> 05:26.223
Mary Jane is going to
sign off of her own show.

05:26.233 --> 05:29.348
But thank you.
- We're up in 30 seconds.

05:29.358 --> 05:30.807
We're good.

05:30.817 --> 05:33.807
Will you just excuse
me one second?

05:33.817 --> 05:36.973
Mary Jane, listen
to me, baby girl.

05:36.983 --> 05:38.682
Breathe, okay?

05:38.692 --> 05:39.849
Breathe.

05:39.859 --> 05:43.515
Listen, I know I
can put Gayle on,

05:43.525 --> 05:45.849
and she can do the
closing of the show,

05:45.859 --> 05:47.599
but I know you want to
finish this strong.

05:47.609 --> 05:49.473
You understand? Just
sign off, Mama.

05:49.483 --> 05:51.140
All right?

05:51.150 --> 05:53.181
Okay.

05:53.191 --> 05:55.265
Just talk about the nature
of live television.

05:55.275 --> 05:58.015
Let them know you're in the
studio again tomorrow.

05:58.025 --> 06:01.390
You've got this.
You're fine, right?

06:01.400 --> 06:03.473
You're fine.

Just like live television,

06:31.066 --> 06:34.056
life is unpredictable.

back in the studio

06:38.483 --> 06:41.849
and investigate the new schemes

06:41.859 --> 06:45.223
Until then, thank
you for listening.

06:45.233 --> 06:46.473
I'm Mary Jane Paul.

06:48.983 --> 06:50.515
And we're clear.

06:50.525 --> 06:52.432
That was great.

06:52.442 --> 06:54.640
Why did you let me do this?

06:54.650 --> 06:57.973
Why?

06:57.983 --> 06:59.599
Everybody clear
the room please.

06:59.609 --> 07:01.056
No, no, no, no! Please,
everybody stay,

07:01.066 --> 07:03.973
'cause the world now
knows my business!

07:03.983 --> 07:07.140
Why don't you shoot a little B
roll, huh, of my breakdown?

07:07.150 --> 07:08.599
Everybody, clear the room.

07:08.609 --> 07:09.973
Please, give us
a few minutes.

07:09.983 --> 07:12.140
Thank you. Thank you.

07:12.150 --> 07:14.056
Oh, my God.

07:14.066 --> 07:15.265
Oh, my God.

07:15.275 --> 07:17.807
Mary Jane.

07:17.817 --> 07:21.390
Mary Jane, I can only imagine
how you're feeling right now.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.557
No, you cannot imagine
how I'm feeling.

07:23.567 --> 07:26.640
The doctor said that this
is not a perfect process

07:26.650 --> 07:28.473
and that these
things can happen.

07:28.483 --> 07:31.973
So I don't think anyone is
laughing at you, baby girl.

07:31.983 --> 07:33.682
I think they're gonna
be compassionate,

07:33.692 --> 07:35.807
and not just for you,
but for all those women

07:35.817 --> 07:37.432
out there that are
going through this.

07:37.442 --> 07:40.557
Wasn't that our goal
for this story? Huh?

07:40.567 --> 07:43.515
And if you really want
a baby, Mary Jane,

07:43.525 --> 07:45.348
you're gonna have
to go through this.

07:45.358 --> 07:49.599
You said, "Keep going."

07:49.609 --> 07:53.181
"Just keep taking the shots.

07:53.191 --> 07:55.432
"Have a little hope.

07:55.442 --> 07:58.973
"Experience your
worst nightmare.

07:58.983 --> 08:02.724
And then, let's air it."

08:02.734 --> 08:06.515
Kara, where was
your compassion?

08:06.525 --> 08:07.557
That's what I needed:

08:07.567 --> 08:09.265
your compassion.

08:17.609 --> 08:20.557
I knew this wasn't
a good idea.

08:20.567 --> 08:21.973
She can't have babies,

08:21.983 --> 08:23.557
and now the whole
damned world knows.

08:23.567 --> 08:25.724
She's doing it for all
the women who are in this

08:25.734 --> 08:28.223
Lisa, I heard the
man just now

08:28.233 --> 08:30.849
tell my baby that
she's abnormal.

08:30.859 --> 08:33.972
I have never raised my
children to be abnormal.

08:33.982 --> 08:35.807
What tends to happen,
Aunt Helen, is that--

08:35.817 --> 08:37.056
Of course, I
didn't raise them

08:37.066 --> 08:38.515
to spread their
legs on TV, either.

08:38.525 --> 08:40.140
Okay, listen,
it's not that--

08:40.150 --> 08:43.472
How does someone wait 40
years to think about a baby,

08:43.482 --> 08:45.973
and then do this
on national TV?

08:45.983 --> 08:47.515
More and more
women are doing this.

08:47.525 --> 08:50.432
Well, if she is barren

08:50.442 --> 08:52.432
because of my lupus,

08:52.442 --> 08:54.015
I'll never forgive myself.

08:54.025 --> 08:55.807
How did you make
this about you?

08:55.817 --> 08:58.307
There could be a million
reasons why this didn't work.

08:58.317 --> 09:01.056
And even if she was, your lupus
wouldn't be one of them.

09:01.066 --> 09:04.348
Well, she brought all this
attention to her vagina.

09:04.358 --> 09:07.307
Okay, Miss Helen, will
you hold on one second please?

09:07.317 --> 09:11.973
Paul, how do we face this?

09:14.733 --> 09:15.733
Oh.

09:18.733 --> 09:21.568

10:43.925 --> 10:46.749
Damn, do you know another
emotion besides anger?

10:46.759 --> 10:49.332
I mean, I'm here because I'm
concerned about my friend.

10:49.342 --> 10:51.540
Honestly, I don't
have time for this.

10:51.550 --> 10:53.457
Time might be what you need.

10:53.467 --> 10:54.582
Maybe it's a blessing.

10:54.592 --> 10:56.540
I see single women every day

10:56.550 --> 10:58.707
who think that they're
ready for a baby,

10:58.717 --> 11:01.665
and they find out they're
completely unprepared.

11:01.675 --> 11:04.540
Who is ever prepared
for a baby?

11:04.550 --> 11:07.582
I'm just saying that maybe
right now your lifestyle

11:07.592 --> 11:08.956
isn't conducive to
having a child.

11:08.966 --> 11:11.373
I'm sorry. I'm
sorry--conducive?

11:11.383 --> 11:12.873
What are you--what?

11:12.883 --> 11:14.749
Conducive--helpful,
in alignment with--

11:14.759 --> 11:17.499
I don't need a
definition, Lisa.

11:17.509 --> 11:20.749
I need to know where you get
off questioning my lifestyle.

11:20.759 --> 11:22.998
Just calm down.
I'm just saying

11:23.008 --> 11:24.873
that I'm concerned about
some of your choices.

11:24.883 --> 11:26.540
Oh, my choices--oh,
you mean, like,

11:26.550 --> 11:32.081
because I don't choose to be
dateless or sexless or joyless?

11:32.091 --> 11:34.956
Are those the choices that
you're concerned about?

11:34.966 --> 11:37.624
See, I was hoping that I'd
be able to come over here

11:37.634 --> 11:39.373
without you thinking
you had carte blanche

11:39.383 --> 11:41.081
to be as rude and
nasty as you want.

11:41.091 --> 11:42.873
No, you couldn't have
been hoping that,

11:42.883 --> 11:44.665
because you wouldn't have
come at me sideways.

11:44.675 --> 11:46.665
Really--my lifestyle?

11:46.675 --> 11:48.332
You work like a dog,

11:48.342 --> 11:50.749
and if you were serious
about having a baby,

11:50.759 --> 11:52.873
you wouldn't be running around
like a hamster on a wheel.

11:52.883 --> 11:56.165
How else am I supposed
to afford a kid?

11:56.175 --> 11:58.873
I told you your stress
levels were high.

11:58.883 --> 12:02.415
And in the last six months, you
haven't made a single decision

12:02.425 --> 12:04.749
to suggest that you
even want a baby,

12:04.759 --> 12:06.624
let alone should be
allowed to have one.

12:06.634 --> 12:08.290
Wait, allow? Allow?

12:08.300 --> 12:10.873
Oh, wow.

12:10.883 --> 12:12.873
Well, it's like I
just got stabbed,

12:12.883 --> 12:14.998
and instead of
getting a bandage,

12:15.008 --> 12:16.207
I just keep getting stabbed.

12:16.217 --> 12:17.707
Okay. Okay.

12:17.717 --> 12:19.040
It's the middle of the day,

12:19.050 --> 12:20.749
and you already have a drink.

12:20.759 --> 12:22.707
Even if that were good
for your fertility,

12:22.717 --> 12:25.873
I don't think a baby should
be raised by someone

12:25.883 --> 12:28.081
who gets a drink as
soon as the cock crows.

12:28.091 --> 12:31.332
Well, speaking of cocks
crowing, as many blowjobs

12:31.342 --> 12:33.123
as you have given,

12:33.133 --> 12:36.165
you really want to talk to me
about drinking some tequila?

12:36.175 --> 12:39.207
Oral sex is sex, Dr. Hudson.

12:39.217 --> 12:41.915
I shared that with you
as a part of my healing,

12:41.925 --> 12:43.665
and you're gonna throw
that back in my face?

12:43.675 --> 12:45.040
Your healing--okay, yeah.

12:45.050 --> 12:47.081
You're always healing
or reading some book.

12:47.091 --> 12:51.290
At some point, you've got to
just let it go and move on.

12:51.300 --> 12:53.956
Yeah, I get that that is
my issue to figure out,

12:53.966 --> 12:56.290
and you can deflect
all you want,

12:56.300 --> 12:59.707
but you still got your work,
your mister married guy,

12:59.717 --> 13:01.873
David, your mom and your
pop, and what else?

13:01.883 --> 13:05.540
Stop it. How are you
so self-righteous?

13:05.550 --> 13:06.873
This is a joke, right?

13:06.883 --> 13:09.499
You are so extremely
self-righteous.

13:09.509 --> 13:11.749
The only reason that
you have not slept

13:11.759 --> 13:14.956
with a married man is because
you haven't met him yet.

13:14.966 --> 13:18.415
So none of what I'm saying
is true, Mary Jane?

13:18.425 --> 13:20.415
'Cause it's all right to
admit that you're wrong.

13:20.425 --> 13:24.956
I could maybe accept
what you're saying,

13:24.966 --> 13:29.415
except I know where this
is really coming from.

13:29.425 --> 13:32.749
We've been having the same
argument in some way,

13:32.759 --> 13:35.624
shape, or form for
the last five years.

13:37.592 --> 13:41.123
Why are you only mad
at me and not David?

13:41.133 --> 13:43.081
Because you were my friend

13:43.091 --> 13:44.873
and you're supposed
to be loyal to me.

13:44.883 --> 13:46.081
There we go.

13:46.091 --> 13:47.873
There we go. Now we're
getting somewhere.

13:47.883 --> 13:49.540
You finally admitted it.
Here we go.

13:49.550 --> 13:52.081
I can't believe I'm about
to have this stupid-ass

13:52.091 --> 13:53.707
high school discussion,
but here we go.

13:53.717 --> 13:55.873
Since you love
revisionist history,

13:55.883 --> 13:57.373
let me give you a
little reminder.

13:57.383 --> 14:00.915
You kept calling
David your friend,

14:00.925 --> 14:02.998
so he asked me out.

14:03.008 --> 14:08.290
I did not accept until
you said, "Okay."

14:08.300 --> 14:09.873
So don't come in my house

14:09.883 --> 14:12.707
and try to lecture me about
accepting my decisions.

14:15.717 --> 14:17.040
Wait. Wait. Wait a second.

14:17.050 --> 14:18.499
Wait a second, Lisa.

14:18.509 --> 14:19.749
Lisa, wake up.

14:21.634 --> 14:24.665
He didn't want you.

14:24.675 --> 14:27.123
Well, now you know

What are you doing here?

16:28.883 --> 16:31.749
I thought maybe you
could use a friend.

16:31.759 --> 16:34.165
I was worried about you.

16:34.175 --> 16:38.457
You have a lot of things to
be worried about these days.

16:38.467 --> 16:42.081
Does that mean I can't
still worry about you?

16:42.091 --> 16:43.998
I guess.

16:46.675 --> 16:50.873
Well, I'm sure you probably
need to get to work.

16:50.883 --> 16:52.415
I do.

16:52.425 --> 16:55.582
I'm not gonna hold you up. I
just wanted to give you these.

16:57.634 --> 17:00.373
Thank you.

17:00.383 --> 17:04.749
And call me if you
need anything.

17:04.759 --> 17:07.373
I'm here.

17:07.383 --> 17:08.624
I know.

17:11.008 --> 17:12.873
Hey.

17:18.175 --> 17:20.040
I'm always gonna be here.

17:22.509 --> 17:24.707
Some things are complicated,

17:24.717 --> 17:27.207
but this doesn't need
to be one of 'em.

17:43.550 --> 17:45.582
Have a good day, all right?

18:02.966 --> 18:04.873
Come on, Trey.

18:04.883 --> 18:07.873
I told you we call him
by his full name.

18:07.883 --> 18:10.332
Yo, what are you doing, man?

18:10.342 --> 18:11.665
Don't yell at my son.

18:11.675 --> 18:13.956
Look, he's my son too, Niecy.

18:15.425 --> 18:18.373
Well, Cameron, you should
act like it more often.

18:18.383 --> 18:21.582
Look, unless you got something
to tell me, this is my son too,

18:21.592 --> 18:23.165
so he needs to obey me.

18:23.175 --> 18:24.540
Obey you?

18:24.550 --> 18:25.956
He doesn't even know you.

18:25.966 --> 18:28.081
And you constantly
reminding me of that

18:28.091 --> 18:31.873
isn't helping anything,
Niecy, especially Trey...

18:31.883 --> 18:34.415
vion.

18:34.425 --> 18:36.332
You know what?

18:36.342 --> 18:38.499
You can show yourself out.

18:38.509 --> 18:41.123
Go. Show yourself out.

18:41.133 --> 18:43.415
Bye...

18:43.425 --> 18:45.415
for another two years.

18:45.425 --> 18:49.499
Sometimes we have to do
what's best for our children,

18:49.509 --> 18:52.040
even when it doesn't
benefit us.

18:52.050 --> 18:54.915
Let me translate in a language
you can understand...

18:56.883 --> 18:59.707
It ain't always about you.

19:04.425 --> 19:05.707
Don't worry, my man.

19:05.717 --> 19:07.624
We're gonna get out of here.

19:07.634 --> 19:09.457
Go ahead and go
upstairs, baby.

19:09.467 --> 19:11.457
Every day for
the next 15 years,

19:11.467 --> 19:14.915
roughly 10,000 Baby
Boomers will turn 65.

19:14.925 --> 19:17.707
The market to provide housing
communities for this aging group

19:17.717 --> 19:20.749
is wide open, particularly
at the design level.

19:20.759 --> 19:23.665
Now, I believe my thoughtful
and cutting edge approach,

19:23.675 --> 19:25.998
combined with your
development contracts

19:26.008 --> 19:27.873
can position us to
launch the first

19:27.883 --> 19:29.915
in a collection of high-end
retirement communities

19:29.925 --> 19:31.499
right here in Georgia.

19:31.509 --> 19:36.248
And as you'll see,
within six quarters,

19:36.258 --> 19:41.081
we'd create infrastructure to
expand to additional states.

19:41.091 --> 19:43.123
I'll get straight
to the chase, Paul.

19:43.133 --> 19:45.290
There's definitely
an angle here,

19:45.300 --> 19:47.332
but what really
snatched my interest

19:47.342 --> 19:48.956
was that you actually

19:48.966 --> 19:52.165
already own significant choice
acreage at Lake Keowee.

19:52.175 --> 19:53.915
Thank you.

19:53.925 --> 19:56.207
My family's vacationed there
many times when I was young.

19:56.217 --> 19:57.998
I knew it was a
special place then.

19:58.008 --> 20:00.081
I've been buying the land
since I was in college.

20:00.091 --> 20:01.540
Well, you've got a good eye,

20:01.550 --> 20:03.373
'cause everybody
wants it now.

20:03.383 --> 20:05.332
Is that why you switched
to architecture

20:05.342 --> 20:07.831
and gave up on
the law degree?

20:07.841 --> 20:09.707
Guilty.

20:09.717 --> 20:10.915
Listen. This is great.

20:10.925 --> 20:12.290
I mean, I get it.

20:12.300 --> 20:14.665
City council over there
has offered up some land

20:14.675 --> 20:17.123
development permits and
you need me to get one.

20:17.133 --> 20:18.790
And build it.

20:18.800 --> 20:21.415
Besides the land and
some fancy drawings,

20:21.425 --> 20:23.707
what are you bringing
to the table?

20:23.717 --> 20:28.290
Well, tell me what
else you need.

20:28.300 --> 20:32.415
Another investor with 3
to 5 million in capital

20:32.425 --> 20:34.665
to take you seriously.

20:37.342 --> 20:41.165
Eight, nine, and ten.

20:42.841 --> 20:44.165
All right, come on, son.

20:44.175 --> 20:46.081
We're playing hide and
go seek, all right?

20:46.091 --> 20:47.749
That means you got to
hide your whole body,

20:47.759 --> 20:49.248
not just half, all right?

20:49.258 --> 20:51.081
What are you doing?

20:53.883 --> 20:56.707
What are you doing here?

20:56.717 --> 20:59.457
You know, playing
hide and go seek.

20:59.467 --> 21:02.040
Well, you can't just come
up in my house unannounced.

21:02.050 --> 21:03.749
It's my house,

21:03.759 --> 21:05.873
and I told him he
could come back.

21:07.675 --> 21:11.624
Cameron, leave now, for real.

21:11.634 --> 21:14.415
No, no, no.

21:14.425 --> 21:18.332
We're not gonna do this.

21:18.342 --> 21:20.290
You let him come up in here,

21:20.300 --> 21:23.499
and I'm wrong?

21:23.509 --> 21:25.457
Let me talk to you, Niecy.

21:31.342 --> 21:33.123
Why would you do that?

21:34.925 --> 21:37.956
I told you this
wasn't about you.

21:37.966 --> 21:39.873
He needs to show
me some respect.

21:39.883 --> 21:42.873
How has he disrespected you?

21:42.883 --> 21:44.873
You just doing this
to get back at me.

21:44.883 --> 21:47.707
Oh, little girl,
you're not mad at me

21:47.717 --> 21:52.373
or your auntie or Cameron
or the little Filipino boy.

21:52.383 --> 21:53.582
It's you.

21:53.592 --> 21:56.207
You're angry with yourself.

21:56.217 --> 21:58.540
Hell, I see you
rolling your eyes

21:58.550 --> 22:02.040
like I'm the big bad
wolf in your life,

22:02.050 --> 22:06.040
but I'm standing right
here tussling with you

22:06.050 --> 22:08.873
because I know you
can do better.

22:11.883 --> 22:14.540
You could have at least
told me he was here.

22:16.300 --> 22:19.873
I was mad that
you were asleep.

22:19.883 --> 22:21.998
Grandma, I was up all
night with Belle.

22:23.592 --> 22:26.373
It's funny.

22:26.383 --> 22:29.998
You barely ever cried
when you were a baby.

22:31.467 --> 22:34.956
I used to always say you were like me.
Mm-hmm.

22:34.966 --> 22:37.665
Came here to get things done.

22:37.675 --> 22:39.749
Didn't have time to cry.

22:47.592 --> 22:51.499
Prove me right, please.

22:53.091 --> 22:56.081
Now, you know Grandma
likes to be right.

22:58.217 --> 23:02.873
Now, now, now,
don't get those.

23:02.883 --> 23:05.499
I'm tearing up because you
just said that you love me.

23:05.509 --> 23:10.290
Well, but he's gonna think
it's about him, so stop.

23:11.966 --> 23:15.873
Your job is to let him
be the boy's daddy.

23:15.883 --> 23:19.998
Don't make it hard
for him to show up,

23:20.008 --> 23:24.332
and don't do cartwheels
when he does.

23:24.342 --> 23:27.749
Let him walk this.

23:27.759 --> 23:30.665
I'm sorry for everything.

23:30.675 --> 23:34.540
I love you.

23:34.550 --> 23:37.665
Now, now, don't be sorry.

23:37.675 --> 23:40.749
Just live right
the first time.

23:40.759 --> 23:42.582
Translation:

23:42.592 --> 23:44.915
keep your legs closed.

23:46.759 --> 23:50.540
I'm gonna get me
some more apples.

23:53.342 --> 23:55.165
Before I sign off,

23:55.175 --> 23:57.499
I need to address the special
segment which aired yesterday.

23:57.509 --> 23:59.665
Uh-oh. Here we go.

23:59.675 --> 24:01.582
What are you
doing, Mary Jane?

24:01.592 --> 24:03.873
I have no Xanax on me today.

24:03.883 --> 24:06.873
I have been overwhelmed
by your emails...

24:06.883 --> 24:08.415
Push in, damn it.

24:08.425 --> 24:10.499
And Facebook posts
offering your support

24:10.509 --> 24:12.915
and heartfelt testimonials.

24:12.925 --> 24:14.873
While my physician and
I have not yet decided

24:14.883 --> 24:18.457
on my next course of action,
I want to genuinely say

24:18.467 --> 24:21.123
thank you for your
thoughts and your prayers.

24:21.133 --> 24:24.998
And moreover, I thank you
for sharing in my journey.

24:25.008 --> 24:27.332
Carl Gustav Jung said,

24:27.342 --> 24:31.373
"He who looks outside dreams.

24:31.383 --> 24:35.373
He who looks inside awakes."

24:35.383 --> 24:37.415
And I'm Mary Jane Paul.

24:37.425 --> 24:38.665
Thank you for listening.

24:40.717 --> 24:42.582
What was I thinking?

24:42.592 --> 24:43.915
And why didn't you stop me

24:43.925 --> 24:46.081
from doing this whole
infotainment thing?

24:46.091 --> 24:49.165
I could have done the
Modern Motherhood series

24:49.175 --> 24:52.457
without inserting
myself into it.

24:52.467 --> 24:54.582
I'm a corporate whore.

24:54.592 --> 24:57.332
Well, it is a step
up from being

24:57.342 --> 24:59.582
just a regular old ho.

25:01.342 --> 25:03.248
Hello? This thing on?

25:03.258 --> 25:04.915
Hello? Hello?

25:04.925 --> 25:07.165
Oh, Mary Jane, come on.

25:07.175 --> 25:09.499
We all make compromises.

25:09.509 --> 25:11.665
Okay, look, remember,
I'm the dude

25:11.675 --> 25:13.665
who is doing the news

25:13.675 --> 25:17.373
standing up with no tie.

25:17.383 --> 25:20.165
Mark, I realize it's
a big deal for you,

25:20.175 --> 25:24.665
but it does not compare to
being told live, on air,

25:24.675 --> 25:25.915
that you are broken.

25:25.925 --> 25:28.540
It's about as bad as
when Geraldo Rivera

25:28.550 --> 25:30.123
opened up Capone's vault,

25:30.133 --> 25:32.873
and all they found
were dust and cobwebs.

25:32.883 --> 25:34.332
I mean, it's not journalism.

25:34.342 --> 25:36.873
This is mental midgetry.

25:36.883 --> 25:39.040
I mean, we are doing all
these gymnastics to pander

25:39.050 --> 25:41.207
to an audience that doesn't
even appreciate real news

25:41.217 --> 25:43.373
unless they are info-tained.

25:43.383 --> 25:44.665
Okay, hold on, Mary Jane.

25:44.675 --> 25:46.749
Look, what you did-- you know what?
Scratch that.

25:46.759 --> 25:50.499
What you are doing--it resonates
with a lot of viewers.

25:50.509 --> 25:54.248
I actually like your story.

25:54.258 --> 25:56.915
Before Eric and I broke up,

25:56.925 --> 26:01.081
we were actually talking
about adopting a baby.

26:01.091 --> 26:03.290
Adoption? Really?

26:03.300 --> 26:05.457
Yeah, you know,

26:05.467 --> 26:09.873
here I am in my 40s just
dancing three years now.

26:09.883 --> 26:12.248
He's gone, I'm alone,

26:12.258 --> 26:17.582
and I have no clue
what my future holds.

26:17.592 --> 26:20.123
Baby, why couldn't you
just say that you're 43?

26:20.133 --> 26:24.332
'Cause I refuse.

26:24.342 --> 26:26.207
Why didn't you tell me?

26:26.217 --> 26:27.998
Look, despite what Eric
thought, you know,

26:28.008 --> 26:31.248
some conversations are
just best between lovers,

26:31.258 --> 26:35.624
so while I don't have follicles
or eggs or a vagina,

26:35.634 --> 26:39.415
it doesn't mean you're alone.
Mary Jane--

26:39.425 --> 26:42.499
Oh, my God, I can't
stop crying.

26:42.509 --> 26:44.415
Oh great--walls of glass.

26:44.425 --> 26:45.540
Listen. Listen. Listen.

26:45.550 --> 26:47.415
Don't worry, okay? I got you.

26:47.425 --> 26:49.207
I got you, all right?

27:00.883 --> 27:02.749
So what does she
want in return

27:02.759 --> 27:05.749
for this kind of latitude?

27:05.759 --> 27:08.165
She must want to see some kind
of quantitative investment

27:08.175 --> 27:10.290
on your part, otherwise she's
assuming all the risk.

27:10.300 --> 27:13.873
A $5 million investment
to prove I'm serious.

27:13.883 --> 27:15.915
She says a straightforward
capital investment

27:15.925 --> 27:17.956
will legitimize the project.

27:17.966 --> 27:20.373
Now, that's what I've
been building towards,

27:20.383 --> 27:23.415
but I just don't
have 5 million.

27:23.425 --> 27:26.499
Mm-hmm. Well, I hope you're
not expecting it from me.

27:26.509 --> 27:29.873
No. Look, that's not
what I'm asking, okay?

27:29.883 --> 27:33.707
I just need some advice on
the offer she's making.

27:33.717 --> 27:35.956
Well, the first question
is do you want to partner

27:35.966 --> 27:39.540
with an angel investor
or a venture capitalist?

27:39.550 --> 27:41.873
Well, I've already talked to
Jake, and he's pretty sure

27:41.883 --> 27:44.707
we can convince his
father to double down.

27:44.717 --> 27:46.123
Are you really
sure you want Jake

27:46.133 --> 27:47.290
to have a stake
in your company?

27:47.300 --> 27:48.540
No, no.

27:48.550 --> 27:49.665
Jake didn't go
to that meeting.

27:49.675 --> 27:51.040
You did.

27:51.050 --> 27:52.123
Jake didn't secure the offer.

27:52.133 --> 27:53.873
You did.

27:53.883 --> 27:56.873
Jake didn't
conceptualize the idea.

27:56.883 --> 27:58.116
You did.

27:58.147 --> 28:00.624
Don't let that boy and his
daddy capitalize off of you

28:00.634 --> 28:04.373
simply because they were born
into the freedom of wealth.

28:04.383 --> 28:08.262
Donald Sterling's rants
didn't teach you anything?

28:09.550 --> 28:11.248
Stick with your own.

28:11.258 --> 28:12.290
That's the way they do it.

28:12.300 --> 28:14.457
Okay.

28:14.467 --> 28:17.290
I know there'll always be
people who think like that,

28:17.300 --> 28:19.165
but Jake's my friend first.

28:19.175 --> 28:21.499
I trust him.

28:21.509 --> 28:24.081
You know, this sounds like a
great investment opportunity

28:24.091 --> 28:28.998
for a young internet
guru with liquid assets.

28:30.883 --> 28:32.248
David?

28:32.258 --> 28:34.873
New money's always
looking to spend money,

28:34.883 --> 28:36.998
and he'll probably give you
double of what you ask him

28:37.008 --> 28:39.123
just to impress Pauletta.

28:39.133 --> 28:42.123
He likes this family. He's
not gonna mess that up.

28:42.133 --> 28:44.956
Use it to your advantage.

28:44.966 --> 28:47.665
I just don't want
to piss of Letta.

28:47.675 --> 28:51.665
You know how complicated
they like to be.

28:51.675 --> 28:54.081
I get why she's
not calling me,

28:54.091 --> 28:57.123
but why isn't she
calling you?

28:57.133 --> 28:58.873
She's mad at me again.

28:58.883 --> 29:00.873
You know your daughter.

29:00.883 --> 29:04.332
She could be dead like
that girl she reported on.

29:04.342 --> 29:06.665
Really, you girls...

29:06.675 --> 29:08.290
I'm sure she'll call you.

29:15.217 --> 29:18.165
I think they're gonna
choose house number two.

29:18.175 --> 29:20.373
Me too.

29:20.383 --> 29:23.040
Hey, what's up, PJ?
- Yo, glad to see you, brother.

29:23.050 --> 29:24.998
Thanks for
coming by so quickly.

29:25.008 --> 29:26.873
Oh, no problem. I
was in the neighborhood.

29:26.883 --> 29:29.582
Hey, Lisa. How's Mary Jane?

29:34.217 --> 29:35.956
I'm fine, David.

29:35.966 --> 29:37.873
Thanks for asking.

29:46.258 --> 29:49.373
Okay, first, let me thank you
for taking the time to stop by.

29:49.383 --> 29:51.749
Oh yeah, I mean, you sounded
pretty serious on the phone, so.

29:51.759 --> 29:54.915
It is very serious.

29:54.925 --> 29:56.582
It's not about my sister.

29:56.592 --> 29:58.624
Calm down. Okay?

29:58.634 --> 30:00.081
Yeah, all right.

30:00.091 --> 30:03.165
I have a business
opportunity for you.

30:03.175 --> 30:06.081
Now, I've mentioned
to you many times

30:06.091 --> 30:10.499
about my retirement
community development.

30:10.509 --> 30:11.915
Oh, yeah, over
at Lake Keowee?

30:11.925 --> 30:13.290
Yeah.

30:13.300 --> 30:15.207
Well, now I have the attention
of Barbara Ling-Cho,

30:15.217 --> 30:17.415
CEO of Carter.

30:17.425 --> 30:19.081
Wow.

30:19.091 --> 30:20.582
That's impressive,
grasshopper.

30:20.592 --> 30:22.248
Thank you.

30:22.258 --> 30:24.790
Well, the real estate trade's
been talking Keowee up.

30:24.800 --> 30:27.332
Yes, and I know how committed
you are to promoting

30:27.342 --> 30:32.040
and investing in our community's
economic participation, so I--

30:32.050 --> 30:34.207
That's something I say
when I give speeches.

30:36.841 --> 30:38.998
All right?
- Yeah.

30:39.008 --> 30:42.373
She's looking for a commitment.
How much?

30:42.383 --> 30:45.749
5 mill.

30:45.759 --> 30:47.790
Hmm.

30:56.425 --> 30:59.665
Yeah, I think I
can raise that.

30:59.675 --> 31:02.123
You think you can--okay.

31:02.133 --> 31:04.081
But when I do,

31:04.091 --> 31:07.998
my group's gonna need
49.9% ownership equity.

31:08.008 --> 31:10.040
Come on, man.
You're killing me.

31:10.050 --> 31:13.207
I'm already splitting my
profit in half with Jake.

31:13.217 --> 31:15.540
That's not my issue, is it?

31:15.550 --> 31:17.540
I mean, you guys
are gonna maintain

31:17.550 --> 31:19.332
controlling interest
of the company,

31:19.342 --> 31:22.290
and how you split that between
the two of you is your business.

31:22.300 --> 31:24.081
But one thing I do
want to make sure of

31:24.091 --> 31:27.040
is that we're being
transparent with Mary Jane.

31:27.050 --> 31:28.540
What does she think
about all this?

31:28.550 --> 31:30.665
She's cool. Look, come on.

31:30.675 --> 31:33.956
You know us Pattersons,
we stick together.

31:33.966 --> 31:36.915
So why don't I
call your office

31:36.925 --> 31:39.956
once my lawyer draws
up the paperwork?

31:39.966 --> 31:41.499
Sounds good.

31:41.509 --> 31:43.499
Whew, well, give it to me.

31:43.509 --> 31:45.749
We're family, man. Come here.

31:45.759 --> 31:48.873
We've already teased
a conclusion to part one,

31:48.883 --> 31:51.040
and the promotions
department would prefer

31:51.050 --> 31:52.707
to air it on Monday.

31:52.717 --> 31:54.915
The live team is still
prepared for a second visit

31:54.925 --> 31:57.998
to Dr. Marrs' office should you
go through with the extraction.

31:58.008 --> 31:59.540
We can sell
it as a long shot--

31:59.550 --> 32:00.873
a hopeful long shot.

32:00.883 --> 32:02.707
You know, chart the costs,

32:02.717 --> 32:06.123
spin an angle on the insurance
coverage or the lack thereof,

32:06.133 --> 32:08.956
and we'd reinvigorate
the Obamacare debate,

32:08.966 --> 32:11.332
which would flow nicely
into the legacy package.

32:11.342 --> 32:14.540
You know, take a look
back before moving ahead.

32:14.550 --> 32:15.873
I'm almost done vetting

32:15.883 --> 32:17.665
the founder of that
co-parenting site,

32:17.675 --> 32:19.290
Modamaly.

32:19.300 --> 32:21.665
Maybe we could sell a part two
before concluding part one?

32:21.675 --> 32:23.207
No, no, no. Absolutely not.

32:23.217 --> 32:26.749
No. That's not the conversation
we're having at all.

32:26.759 --> 32:30.915
Look, Mary Jane, I know this is
difficult for you personally,

32:30.925 --> 32:32.873
but we have got to
give these guys

32:32.883 --> 32:35.749
some kind of direction
before tomorrow.

32:35.759 --> 32:37.707
And if you're not going
back to Dr. Marrs,

32:37.717 --> 32:39.873
then we need to
prepare a conclusion

32:39.883 --> 32:42.873
for this segment before we
launch into anything else.

32:47.383 --> 32:49.123
I'll let you know.

32:55.342 --> 32:57.749
Oh, boy. Okay.

33:18.883 --> 33:19.998
Hey, Dad.

33:20.008 --> 33:21.165
What are you doing here?

33:21.175 --> 33:22.873
Hey. Couldn't sleep.

33:22.883 --> 33:24.873
And the hot light was on.

33:27.342 --> 33:28.707
Smart girl.

33:28.717 --> 33:29.873
Oh, yeah.

33:29.883 --> 33:31.248
Better than a dog,

33:31.258 --> 33:32.665
quiet, and just as effective.

33:32.675 --> 33:33.873
Come on.

33:36.717 --> 33:38.457
So everybody's
doing all right?

33:38.467 --> 33:41.332
Yeah, believe it or not.

33:41.342 --> 33:44.332
I think they may have
reached an understanding...

33:44.342 --> 33:45.915
finally.

33:47.883 --> 33:51.499
And Cameron is coming
around, so it's good.

33:51.509 --> 33:54.248
Really? Good for her.

33:59.592 --> 34:02.624
I don't know anymore, Dad.

34:02.634 --> 34:05.956
I mean, when that
thing first started,

34:05.966 --> 34:10.123
I just kind of felt like
it was work, you know?

34:10.132 --> 34:14.248
But after what happened
yesterday, I mean, God,

34:14.257 --> 34:17.456
it's frightening, 'cause
it's finally dawning on me.

34:17.467 --> 34:21.373
Like, what if I can't
have babies at all?

34:21.382 --> 34:24.165
Well, baby, maybe that's
not such a bad thing.

34:24.175 --> 34:26.456
Why would you say
something like that?

34:26.467 --> 34:29.498
Because I'm not convinced that
you really want children.

34:29.509 --> 34:30.706
Were you watching yesterday?

34:30.717 --> 34:32.081
Yeah.

34:32.091 --> 34:34.040
Do you think I would suffer
public embarrassment

34:34.050 --> 34:36.623
because I don't
want to have kids?

34:36.634 --> 34:41.956
Call it a father's intuition.

34:41.966 --> 34:45.873
Call it 38 years of watching
and raising a child

34:45.882 --> 34:50.081
who, from college to grad
school to the news room,

34:50.091 --> 34:53.456
always went after what
she wanted and got it.

34:53.467 --> 34:57.749
Call it doing the analysis

34:57.759 --> 35:00.873
and finding it strange
that the only goal

35:00.883 --> 35:03.873
that has eluded you is
a husband and a baby.

35:05.717 --> 35:09.624
You're trying to make it seem
like it's all within my control,

35:09.634 --> 35:11.040
like I can just cast a spell,

35:11.050 --> 35:12.873
and poof: husband and a baby.

35:12.883 --> 35:15.582
I mean, getting what
you and mom have--

35:15.592 --> 35:17.540
it doesn't happen like that.

35:17.550 --> 35:19.499
What we have started
in a tradition

35:19.509 --> 35:22.040
that I don't think is
even relevant today.

35:22.050 --> 35:23.665
You've got to throw
out of your mind

35:23.675 --> 35:25.665
what we have and
start focusing in

35:25.675 --> 35:29.165
on what it is that
makes you happy.

35:29.175 --> 35:31.956
Pauletta Patterson, what
your mother and I have

35:31.966 --> 35:35.123
is not something you
should aspire to.

35:35.133 --> 35:37.749
I am confused.

35:37.759 --> 35:42.165
I'm saying that I
worked my ass off

35:42.175 --> 35:44.624
at the airlines for years to
give my children everything,

35:44.634 --> 35:46.081
and what I'm beginning to see

35:46.091 --> 35:49.040
is my children are
drifting out to sea

35:49.050 --> 35:50.873
with no direction,
unaware of the fact

35:50.883 --> 35:55.207
that a rip tide is about
to pull them under.

35:55.217 --> 35:57.207
Pauletta, figure it out.

35:57.217 --> 36:01.123
That boy loves you,
and you love him.

36:01.133 --> 36:05.123
You've even got his
college shirt on.

36:05.133 --> 36:09.290
So what if it's not
the perfect package?

36:09.300 --> 36:13.665
Let that woman give him the
babies that you don't want.

36:13.675 --> 36:16.207
So what am I supposed to
do, just go get my man

36:16.217 --> 36:18.040
even though he's
with somebody else?

36:18.050 --> 36:21.040
No, you're supposed to go out
there and get your happiness.

36:21.050 --> 36:24.207
And if it's David,

36:24.217 --> 36:27.165
don't let misunderstandings
and misinterpretations

36:27.175 --> 36:28.873
get in your way.

36:28.883 --> 36:31.499
Stop chasing some Leave
It to Beaver dream

36:31.509 --> 36:33.956
that doesn't really work.

36:33.966 --> 36:37.873
Stop chasing goals that
you really don't want.

36:37.883 --> 36:39.915
Focus on the ones
that you do,

36:39.925 --> 36:43.540
and move toward
'em with gusto.

36:43.550 --> 36:47.624
I'm also saying if it's
not David, move on.

36:47.634 --> 36:51.873
And if you don't want to
live in Atlanta anymore, go.

36:51.883 --> 36:56.915
Don't tether yourself to
us, worrying about us,

36:56.925 --> 36:59.873
and forgetting about you and
what it is that you want.

37:03.883 --> 37:05.873
I'm exhausted.

37:11.509 --> 37:13.415
I can't stand it
anymore, Dad.

37:15.509 --> 37:18.873
Well, don't have children.

37:34.008 --> 37:35.624
Hey
Kara, it's me.

37:35.634 --> 37:37.373
I hope you're not at work,
but you probably are,

37:37.383 --> 37:39.457
so go home.

37:39.467 --> 37:40.873
I'm not gonna go
through with it,

37:40.883 --> 37:43.290
but I have an idea
for Friday's show,

37:43.300 --> 37:44.956
so I'll talk to you later.

38:43.509 --> 38:45.165
Egg freezing is most ideal

38:45.175 --> 38:48.123
for women between the
ages of 30 and 38.

38:48.133 --> 38:51.207
And while most experts agree
success largely depends

38:51.217 --> 38:54.873
on the woman's age, cancellation
due to immature follicles

38:54.883 --> 38:59.165
occurs in 10% to 20% of
IVF treatment cycles.

38:59.175 --> 39:00.582
With the cost of such treatments

39:00.592 --> 39:03.749
ranging from $10 to
$20,000 a cycle,

39:03.759 --> 39:06.332
it's no wonder the process
can become emotionally

39:06.342 --> 39:09.332
and financially exhaustive.

39:09.342 --> 39:10.873
I don't recommend it.

39:10.883 --> 39:13.165
But is there a chance
I can get pregnant

39:13.175 --> 39:15.165
with one of those four eggs?

39:15.175 --> 39:17.332
Yes.

39:17.342 --> 39:18.749
Then I want to
take that chance.

39:18.759 --> 39:20.873
Okay then.

39:20.883 --> 39:22.665
The trigger shot will
give your follicles

39:22.675 --> 39:24.749
one last boost before
the extraction.

39:24.759 --> 39:27.248
You'll take home a
syringe and two vials.

39:27.258 --> 39:29.081
I will not proceed
on the path

39:29.091 --> 39:32.081
toward freezing my eggs
here on Talk Back,

39:32.091 --> 39:34.123
but I encourage every woman
out there to continue

39:34.133 --> 39:38.332
to explore different paths
to modern day motherhood.

39:38.342 --> 39:41.873
As Plato said: "Necessity
breeds invention."

39:41.883 --> 39:43.915
And I suspect that
society will continue

39:43.925 --> 39:45.873
to prove this to be true.

39:45.883 --> 39:47.415
Until next week,

39:47.425 --> 39:48.665
I'm Mary Jane Paul.

39:48.675 --> 39:50.207
Thanks for listening.

39:50.217 --> 39:53.373
Time is of the essence, so
once you take the shot,

39:53.383 --> 39:54.922
you'll have 36 hours

39:54.945 --> 39:57.707
until you need to get back
here for the extraction.

39:57.717 --> 40:00.373
And then, of course,
we'll hope for the best.
