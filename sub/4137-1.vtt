contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:36.570 --> 00:38.515
Have those printed
out on my desk.

00:38.539 --> 00:41.351
Mm-hmm. I'll be in in an hour.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.695
Oh, I need to go
over the layouts

00:42.719 --> 00:43.999
with the art department as well.

00:44.023 --> 00:45.615
Yep. Same time as usual.

00:48.549 --> 00:49.549
Uh-huh.

00:51.285 --> 00:52.753
Yeah.

00:55.133 --> 00:56.133
Okay.

00:56.157 --> 00:59.203
Did you get my memo on
the testing results?

00:59.227 --> 01:01.371
The tea caddy's gonna
be huge this year!

01:01.395 --> 01:04.241
Coffee's king, but tea's
trending this season,

01:04.265 --> 01:05.509
which reminds me,

01:05.533 --> 01:07.277
I still have a lot
of serious concerns

01:07.301 --> 01:08.536
about that lemon squeezer.

01:10.838 --> 01:12.882
Uh-huh.

01:12.906 --> 01:15.119
All right, we're all set to
finalize the catalogue...

01:15.143 --> 01:16.686
It's black, white, touch of red.

01:16.710 --> 01:19.380
Classic, but a little
bit of whimsy.

01:22.850 --> 01:24.728
Uh-huh?

01:24.752 --> 01:27.231
Okay, well then, what
time is the meeting?

01:27.255 --> 01:28.165
Well, cancel it.

01:28.189 --> 01:30.424
We're gonna have to
work through lunch.

01:33.561 --> 01:35.805
Uh-huh.

01:35.829 --> 01:38.208
So what did the memo say?

01:38.232 --> 01:39.752
We're going to feature
the chafing dish

01:39.776 --> 01:41.711
with the Brussels sprouts.

01:41.735 --> 01:44.248
Because Brussels sprouts
are the new asparagus.

01:44.272 --> 01:45.749
Alright.

01:45.773 --> 01:48.618
No. No! That is not
what my father said.

01:48.642 --> 01:52.213
We're gonna lead with the
electric pepper grinder.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.825
Mm-hmm.

01:55.849 --> 01:59.863
Okay. We still need to deal
with the cheese-slicer issue.

01:59.887 --> 02:01.298
Perfect.

02:01.322 --> 02:03.491
Thank you! Enjoy.

02:04.892 --> 02:07.471
Cheddar's out. Jarlsburg's in.

02:07.495 --> 02:09.439
Swiss, yes. I'm sorry.

02:09.463 --> 02:10.507
Um... sorry.

02:10.531 --> 02:12.376
Sorry. Can I...

02:12.400 --> 02:13.577
One second. Yep.

02:13.601 --> 02:15.812
Swiss, yes. Colby, no.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.914
Havarti's the new parmesan.

02:17.938 --> 02:19.883
Well, don't stop there.

02:19.907 --> 02:21.885
What about cheez whiz?

02:21.909 --> 02:24.412
Gridley?

02:25.713 --> 02:26.956
Josie?

02:26.980 --> 02:29.659
I'm gonna have to call you back.
Hi!

02:29.683 --> 02:30.960
Hi!

02:30.984 --> 02:32.529
Um, how long has it been?

02:32.553 --> 02:33.597
Uh...

02:33.621 --> 02:35.299
- High school?
- Yeah!

02:35.323 --> 02:37.667
Oh, it's been, like, a
million years since... prom!

02:37.691 --> 02:39.636
Uh, yeah!

02:39.660 --> 02:41.971
- Oh! No...
- Oh! No.

02:41.995 --> 02:42.906
- Yeah...
- Ugh.

02:42.930 --> 02:44.574
Ah, I can still see
your parents' faces

02:44.598 --> 02:45.609
when I opened that door.

02:45.633 --> 02:46.913
Yeah, well, I'm still seeing you

02:46.937 --> 02:48.345
in your shiny green tux.

02:48.369 --> 02:49.613
It was festive!

02:49.637 --> 02:51.348
It was pretty green.

02:51.372 --> 02:54.284
Well, I can still see you
at the top of the stairs.

02:54.308 --> 02:55.885
You had that sparkly dress
and your hair all...

02:55.909 --> 02:56.786
- whatever...
- Big. Really big.

02:56.810 --> 02:58.855
Whatever you call it,
with the flowers.

02:58.879 --> 03:00.557
You were the prettiest
girl I'd ever seen.

03:00.581 --> 03:02.859
Thanks.

03:02.883 --> 03:04.894
What happened to you? You
really let yourself go.

03:04.918 --> 03:06.330
Yeah.

03:06.354 --> 03:07.531
So I've heard all these
stories about you,

03:07.555 --> 03:09.299
just traveling, all
over the place.

03:09.323 --> 03:11.401
What are you doing
back here in the city?

03:11.425 --> 03:12.369
- You remember Teddy?
- Yeah.

03:12.393 --> 03:13.237
From high school?

03:13.261 --> 03:15.372
Teddy who sat behind
me in algebra?

03:15.396 --> 03:16.940
Yeah, so he sold
his tech company,

03:16.964 --> 03:18.804
and I'm house-sitting
while he's in California.

03:18.828 --> 03:21.345
Six months free rent,
plus valet parking.

03:21.369 --> 03:23.613
Then I find a place of my own.

03:23.637 --> 03:24.717
And I see, in the meantime,

03:24.741 --> 03:27.317
you're dealing in driftwood.

03:27.341 --> 03:28.852
Yes. Driftwood is
the new plywood.

03:28.876 --> 03:29.953
Is it?

03:29.977 --> 03:31.721
When they sell, I
do pretty well.

03:31.745 --> 03:32.989
These are really amazing.

03:33.013 --> 03:36.526
Thank you. And you're
running a corporate empire?

03:36.550 --> 03:37.527
No, still working for my dad

03:37.551 --> 03:38.662
at Mayfield's.

03:38.686 --> 03:39.829
Oh, I just bought
one of your spoons.

03:39.853 --> 03:40.897
Did you? Pasta? Salad?

03:40.921 --> 03:41.998
I have no idea,

03:42.022 --> 03:43.400
but it makes a
great minute-hand.

03:43.424 --> 03:45.535
- That is pasta...
- Salad? Pasta.

03:45.559 --> 03:46.870
It's pasta.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.438
What is this? A sundial?

03:48.462 --> 03:51.341
Yep. It's, uh, 7:30-ish.

03:51.365 --> 03:52.509
7:30.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.173
Well, that's... I mean,
it's really 7:20.

03:54.197 --> 03:55.345
Yeah, your watch says 7:30.

03:55.369 --> 03:57.049
I set it 10 minutes
early, so I'm not late.

03:57.073 --> 03:58.548
Why not 15?

03:58.572 --> 03:59.812
Because that would be neurotic?

03:59.836 --> 04:00.784
Mm. Funny.

04:00.808 --> 04:02.319
I'm gonna go,

04:02.343 --> 04:03.887
but would you like
to share contacts?

04:03.911 --> 04:06.323
I don't have a phone.

04:06.347 --> 04:08.024
- Okay...
- Anywhere.

04:08.048 --> 04:09.893
But if you got a pen,
I'll write it on my hand.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.595
- I definitely don't have a pen.
- Yes.

04:11.619 --> 04:12.859
Are you gonna be here tomorrow?

04:12.883 --> 04:14.364
Low tide all week.

04:14.388 --> 04:16.300
Great. I will see you tomorrow.

04:16.324 --> 04:18.302
- Alright.
- Behave yourself.

04:18.326 --> 04:20.036
No promises. Hey!

04:20.060 --> 04:21.962
Let me know how that
cheese thing turns out!

04:23.364 --> 04:25.375
Pasta!

04:25.399 --> 04:27.911
You're kidding me.

04:27.935 --> 04:30.347
Greetings. I'm Josie Mayfield.

04:30.371 --> 04:32.816
38 years ago, my father
founded Mayfield's

04:32.840 --> 04:34.918
right here in my
mother's kitchen.

04:34.942 --> 04:36.820
Since then, the name Mayfield's

04:36.844 --> 04:38.422
has been synonymous
with cookware,

04:38.446 --> 04:40.557
bakeware, wooden spoons...

04:40.581 --> 04:42.426
And this year, we are
thrilled to introduce

04:42.450 --> 04:44.060
our new Mayfield's tea line

04:44.084 --> 04:45.895
and lemon squeezer.

04:45.919 --> 04:46.930
Ouch!

04:46.954 --> 04:48.932
Uh... ha.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.434
Okay. Well.

04:50.458 --> 04:53.503
Obviously, we will reshoot
the lemon mishap,

04:53.527 --> 04:54.838
but you get the idea.

04:54.862 --> 04:56.702
And I look at this as a
two-pronged approach...

04:56.726 --> 04:58.074
We have a weekly video blog,

04:58.098 --> 04:59.809
and a way to introduce
our customers

04:59.833 --> 05:01.478
to new, exciting products.
Such as...

05:01.502 --> 05:03.380
The Mayfield's home sodamaker...

05:03.404 --> 05:05.081
For the serious soda aficionado.

05:05.105 --> 05:07.016
Mayfield's is about
coffee and tea, not soda.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.618
Yes, sir, I know,

05:08.642 --> 05:10.887
but the 18 to 49-year-old male
is not drinking earl grey

05:10.911 --> 05:12.622
while watching Monday
night football.

05:12.646 --> 05:13.757
Josie, do you know why.

05:13.781 --> 05:14.924
Mayfield's is still in business?

05:14.948 --> 05:15.859
Yes, because we stay the course

05:15.883 --> 05:17.661
and give the customers
what they expect.

05:17.685 --> 05:19.085
- Exactly.
- We're not growing, dad.

05:19.109 --> 05:20.730
We're not shrinking either.

05:20.754 --> 05:21.898
Fine. Alright.

05:21.922 --> 05:24.534
The reps are in. I
will handle them.

05:24.558 --> 05:26.118
Francis in accounting
just had her baby,

05:26.142 --> 05:27.637
so we sent her a very
nice gift basket

05:27.661 --> 05:28.861
with a Mayfield bottle-warmer.

05:28.885 --> 05:30.974
And the product testing
for the cheese-slicer.

05:30.998 --> 05:33.076
Is tomorrow, that does it.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.678
Not quite. You are coming home

05:34.702 --> 05:35.782
for the party this weekend?

05:35.806 --> 05:37.747
- Of course.
- Alone?

05:37.771 --> 05:38.682
No. I'm bringing Richard.

05:38.706 --> 05:39.816
Oh, I see.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.751
Daddy, what is wrong
with Richard?

05:41.775 --> 05:42.752
He's the perfect man.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.654
On paper, yes.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.523
He's... ambitious.

05:46.547 --> 05:47.657
You love ambitious.

05:47.681 --> 05:48.992
He talks too fast.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.494
Really?

05:50.518 --> 05:51.961
Alright, I don't know, exactly,

05:51.985 --> 05:53.863
but there's just
something about him.

05:53.887 --> 05:56.132
Fine. Is there anyone
I could bring home

05:56.156 --> 05:57.567
that you would approve of?

05:57.591 --> 06:00.561
I guess you're just
still my little girl.

06:02.996 --> 06:04.574
Janet, where are those reports?

06:04.598 --> 06:06.158
The client's been
waiting since Monday.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.945
Hey. What are you doing here?

06:08.969 --> 06:10.580
- I missed you.
- Mm-hmm?

06:10.604 --> 06:11.881
And?

06:11.905 --> 06:14.083
And I need five minutes
with your father.

06:14.107 --> 06:15.519
He's not returning my calls.

06:15.543 --> 06:16.720
Richard...

06:16.744 --> 06:18.455
I know, but this
client's a perfect fit.

06:18.479 --> 06:20.857
MBA from Penn, 10
years at P&G...

06:20.881 --> 06:22.125
He could run Mayfield's
foreign sales

06:22.149 --> 06:23.860
with his eyes closed,
and he speaks mandarin.

06:23.884 --> 06:24.994
Trust me... The only mandarin

06:25.018 --> 06:26.618
my father cares about
is "moo shoo pork."

06:26.642 --> 06:28.202
Just put us in a room.
You have his ear.

06:28.226 --> 06:29.098
I have his DNA.

06:29.122 --> 06:30.722
And you two have been
in a room together.

06:30.746 --> 06:33.202
It did not go well. I really
want him to like you.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.538
He will!

06:34.562 --> 06:36.806
No, he won't, if you
keep pitching him.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.642
Plus, he thinks
you're a fast-talker.

06:38.666 --> 06:39.843
What's wrong with talking fast?

06:39.867 --> 06:41.107
Fast-talkers are untrustworthy.

06:41.131 --> 06:42.331
I'll wear him down. You'll see.

06:42.355 --> 06:43.780
What, like water
erodes a mountain?

06:43.804 --> 06:44.748
Exactly.

06:44.772 --> 06:46.683
You do know that takes
billions of years?

06:46.707 --> 06:48.452
I can wait.

06:48.476 --> 06:49.653
Dinner tonight?

06:49.677 --> 06:51.220
Uh, clients. Breakfast tomorrow?

06:51.244 --> 06:52.856
Uh, reps. How about lunch?

06:52.880 --> 06:54.991
Can't. Tied up all day.
Day after looks good.

06:55.015 --> 06:56.726
Oh. 12:30? 1:00.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.686
- Bye.
- Bye.

07:01.822 --> 07:04.191
â™ª â™ª

07:10.130 --> 07:12.108
This placement's not
a walk in the park.

07:12.132 --> 07:13.972
We're not gonna get this
guy in a lateral hire.

07:13.996 --> 07:15.512
He's got options.

07:15.536 --> 07:17.547
Well, what do you want
me to say to you?

07:17.571 --> 07:19.106
I'll call you back.

07:23.711 --> 07:25.579
â™ª â™ª

07:27.014 --> 07:29.759
Mr. Mayfield. Richard.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.561
Richard Wright of
Wright, Silver,

07:31.585 --> 07:34.063
and Gumm Executive Search...

07:34.087 --> 07:36.156
Your daughter's boyfriend?

07:37.925 --> 07:40.236
Yes. I remember.

07:40.260 --> 07:42.639
Did you press all
of those buttons?

07:42.663 --> 07:45.899
No, sir... some kid
must have been in here.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.078
But while we're trapped in here,

07:49.102 --> 07:51.981
I'd like to run
something by you.

07:52.005 --> 07:53.807
â™ª â™ª

07:55.643 --> 07:58.021
So how's next week
looking for you?

07:58.045 --> 08:00.624
Um...

08:00.648 --> 08:02.550
Another time, then?

08:05.085 --> 08:07.888
â™ª â™ª

08:14.562 --> 08:16.005
Well, her invites are ecru,

08:16.029 --> 08:18.608
so she'd like the napkins
to be the same color.

08:18.632 --> 08:20.877
Alright, just please
remember the dessert forks,

08:20.901 --> 08:21.845
sterling only.

08:21.869 --> 08:22.879
Thank you.

08:22.903 --> 08:24.280
Coronation?

08:24.304 --> 08:26.115
Close. My parents are having
a party this weekend.

08:26.139 --> 08:27.584
It's their 40th
wedding anniversary

08:27.608 --> 08:28.888
wow! Congrats.
Send them my best.

08:28.912 --> 08:29.886
Yeah.

08:29.910 --> 08:31.430
On second thought,
why ruin their day?

08:31.454 --> 08:32.922
What are you making here?

08:32.946 --> 08:34.558
I'm thinking camel.

08:34.582 --> 08:38.160
Oh. Camels don't really sell.

08:38.184 --> 08:39.563
Uh, donkey?

08:39.587 --> 08:41.731
Ooh. Political connotations.

08:41.755 --> 08:43.667
You don't want to
limit your clientele.

08:43.691 --> 08:45.068
Alright. How about a horse?

08:45.092 --> 08:46.302
Yes! Yes. Horses

08:46.326 --> 08:48.237
are the number-four
favorite animal,

08:48.261 --> 08:49.773
after dogs, cats, and dolphins.

08:49.797 --> 08:51.575
Then a horse it is! Giddy-up.

08:51.599 --> 08:53.342
Mm-hmm.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.779
You know what? My boyfriend's
partners play polo.

08:55.803 --> 08:57.843
This might look really nice
in their reception area.

08:57.867 --> 08:59.148
You have a boyfriend?

08:59.172 --> 09:00.216
Yeah.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.251
Are you seeing somebody?

09:02.275 --> 09:05.054
Not at the moment.

09:05.078 --> 09:07.824
So...

09:07.848 --> 09:10.226
Who's the lucky guy?

09:10.250 --> 09:13.229
Ooh. Thank you. He is an
executive headhunter.

09:13.253 --> 09:14.964
Ouch.

09:14.988 --> 09:17.734
And what do your folks
think of this boyfriend?

09:17.758 --> 09:18.768
Mm, you know my dad,

09:18.792 --> 09:20.704
he doesn't think anybody's
good enough for me.

09:20.728 --> 09:22.939
I know he didn't think I
was good enough for you.

09:22.963 --> 09:24.073
Don't feel bad.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.257
Richard has everything that's
on my father's checklist,

09:26.281 --> 09:27.811
and he still doesn't approve.

09:27.835 --> 09:29.145
Ah... the Mayfield checklist!

09:29.169 --> 09:31.180
Good job, good family,
good manners.

09:31.204 --> 09:32.816
Goodbye.

09:32.840 --> 09:33.841
Pretty much.

09:35.108 --> 09:36.385
Well, I'm just gonna
come out and say it.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.169
You know why your dad's
repulsed by this guy?

09:38.193 --> 09:39.604
I never said he was repulsed!

09:39.628 --> 09:40.957
Look, it's his job.

09:40.981 --> 09:43.660
No father wants his daughter
dating a cannibal in a suit.

09:43.684 --> 09:45.662
He's not a cannibal.
He is a headhunter.

09:45.686 --> 09:47.096
What's the difference?

09:47.120 --> 09:49.999
Richard places clients
in employment positions,

09:50.023 --> 09:52.702
and a cannibal chops people
up and eats them for dinner.

09:52.726 --> 09:55.739
Tomato, tom-ah-to.

09:55.763 --> 09:56.940
Hey!

09:56.964 --> 09:59.042
Hey! Hey-hey-hey!
That's my minute-hand!

09:59.066 --> 10:00.176
It's okay!

10:00.200 --> 10:01.945
I'll get you another one.

10:01.969 --> 10:03.379
I'll hold you to it.

10:03.403 --> 10:05.281
Okay.

10:05.305 --> 10:08.075
â™ª â™ª

10:18.085 --> 10:21.121
Hello. This is Josie Mayfield.
Please leave a message.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.434
Josie, it's your mother.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.170
I hope you're not bringing

10:27.194 --> 10:29.438
that Richard person
to the party.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.374
Your father had a most
uncomfortable incident

10:31.398 --> 10:33.442
with him in the
elevator yesterday.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.770
At any rate, get back to me
as soon as you can, dear.

10:41.008 --> 10:42.686
Dad, you should go to bed.

10:42.710 --> 10:44.077
You look tired.

10:46.947 --> 10:49.649
â™ª â™ª

10:56.489 --> 10:58.902
You're micro-shuffling again.

10:58.926 --> 11:00.904
How else is this place
going to get in shape?

11:00.928 --> 11:02.568
Claire, there's not a
napkin out of place.

11:02.592 --> 11:03.707
There hasn't been in years.

11:03.731 --> 11:04.908
Please. Just sit.

11:04.932 --> 11:06.333
Rex, dear. Come.

11:08.135 --> 11:09.345
Rex.

11:09.369 --> 11:11.271
Come.

11:14.842 --> 11:16.886
Mindy's coming in tomorrow.

11:16.910 --> 11:18.390
You do recall you
have two daughters?

11:18.414 --> 11:20.023
When Mindy wants to
join the company,

11:20.047 --> 11:21.791
I will muster more enthusiasm.

11:21.815 --> 11:23.092
For heaven's sake...

11:23.116 --> 11:24.596
Let the girl finish
college in peace.

11:24.620 --> 11:25.929
She's been there for five years.

11:25.953 --> 11:27.230
Josie finished in three.

11:27.254 --> 11:30.190
Yes, dear. I know. I
was at the graduation.

11:33.093 --> 11:35.929
â™ª â™ª

11:42.803 --> 11:44.848
I just talked a little
business, that's all.

11:44.872 --> 11:46.149
I spoke slowly.

11:46.173 --> 11:47.483
He doesn't trust people
who speak slowly!

11:47.507 --> 11:49.018
I thought he didn't trust
people who speak fast.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.053
He doesn't! Honey.

11:50.077 --> 11:51.397
Can we just keep
our relationship

11:51.421 --> 11:52.922
separate from
Mayfield's business?

11:52.946 --> 11:54.824
You're right. I'm sorry.

11:54.848 --> 11:56.128
I thought we were
going to lunch?

11:56.152 --> 11:58.312
We are, but first, I want you
to see a driftwood horse.

11:58.336 --> 11:59.062
What?

11:59.086 --> 12:00.166
I ran into a friend of mine

12:00.190 --> 12:01.197
and I would like to buy

12:01.221 --> 12:02.932
one of his sculptures
for your office.

12:02.956 --> 12:04.934
Please! Just indulge me.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.398
He's an old friend
from high school,

12:06.422 --> 12:07.499
and I want to help him.

12:07.523 --> 12:08.271
Why?

12:08.295 --> 12:09.815
Because we were good friends.
You know?

12:09.839 --> 12:11.519
We did all the nerdy
little clubs together,

12:11.543 --> 12:13.542
like glee club and
prom decorating,

12:13.566 --> 12:15.311
and he seems a bit lost.

12:15.335 --> 12:17.881
Uh-huh.

12:17.905 --> 12:20.950
Uh-oh. You'll lose your
head there, buddy.

12:20.974 --> 12:22.151
Hi!

12:22.175 --> 12:25.054
Hey. Corporate
takeover at the park?

12:25.078 --> 12:27.791
Gridley, this is Richard,
Richard, this is Gridley.

12:27.815 --> 12:29.092
Richard Wright.

12:29.116 --> 12:32.028
Ah. So you are Mr.
"Right," literally.

12:32.052 --> 12:33.930
Good to meet you.

12:33.954 --> 12:34.998
You as well.

12:35.022 --> 12:36.165
Oh.

12:36.189 --> 12:37.400
So you two were friends?

12:37.424 --> 12:39.969
Yep! Old friends.
Maplewood High.

12:39.993 --> 12:42.505
Yeah, not to mention we
went to prom together.

12:42.529 --> 12:45.508
Uh, sun tea, anyone? Fresh jug.

12:45.532 --> 12:47.176
Actually, we're just
on our way to lunch.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.412
But I wanted to Richard
to see your horse.

12:49.436 --> 12:52.481
Right. About that...

12:52.505 --> 12:54.417
I know you said
camels don't sell,

12:54.441 --> 12:56.385
but I had to listen to my gut,

12:56.409 --> 12:58.221
and my gut just said...

12:58.245 --> 13:00.890
- Camel?
- Camel. Said "camel."

13:00.914 --> 13:04.451
Now the only question is...
Dromedary, or...

13:07.620 --> 13:09.365
- Bactrian?
- Bactrian. It's more dramatic.

13:09.389 --> 13:11.167
Alright, well, now
that that's settled,

13:11.191 --> 13:13.269
you kids ready for the
big anniversary weekend?

13:13.293 --> 13:14.938
- Oh!
- Oh, by the way...

13:14.962 --> 13:16.305
Do not wear a green tux.

13:16.329 --> 13:17.907
They hate that.

13:17.931 --> 13:19.771
Thanks for the tip, but
I'm actually not going.

13:19.795 --> 13:21.077
My parents are being my parents.

13:21.101 --> 13:22.879
Ah, well, don't
take it personally.

13:22.903 --> 13:25.248
Mr. M gives all Josie's
boyfriends a rough time.

13:25.272 --> 13:26.592
I mean, I probably
won't even go,

13:26.616 --> 13:27.583
so it's fine.

13:27.607 --> 13:29.367
Well, if you don't go,
they'll blame Richard.

13:29.391 --> 13:30.711
There's no coming
back from that.

13:30.735 --> 13:32.388
True. That is a lose/lose.

13:32.412 --> 13:34.412
Well, we should head off.
Good luck with the, uh...

13:34.436 --> 13:35.624
The camel.

13:35.648 --> 13:36.592
Alright. Thank you.

13:36.616 --> 13:37.961
Ooh! For you.

13:37.985 --> 13:40.463
What's this?

13:40.487 --> 13:43.066
The pasta and the salad spoon!

13:43.090 --> 13:44.133
Thank you.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.201
You're welcome.

13:45.225 --> 13:47.070
Now I can add a second-hand!

13:47.094 --> 13:49.238
Good luck.

13:49.262 --> 13:51.040
I got it!

13:51.064 --> 13:52.933
I got it!

13:54.367 --> 13:57.080
Hey. What are you
doing this weekend?

13:57.104 --> 13:58.647
Well, I'd have to
check my schedule.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.249
Uh...

14:00.273 --> 14:01.550
I'm wide open.

14:01.574 --> 14:03.152
You know what would
make your parents

14:03.176 --> 14:04.888
roll out the welcome mat for me?

14:04.912 --> 14:05.922
Him.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.056
What?

14:07.080 --> 14:08.925
Bring him to the party.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.193
I mean, your parents think

14:10.217 --> 14:11.594
that there's somebody
better out there for you.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.662
What if they see that
there's someone worse?

14:13.686 --> 14:14.998
No offense.

14:15.022 --> 14:16.132
Uh, none taken.

14:16.156 --> 14:17.466
That's a terrible idea, Richard.

14:17.490 --> 14:19.335
Uh, well, actually,

14:19.359 --> 14:21.270
to be honest, it's kind
of a brilliant idea.

14:21.294 --> 14:24.373
I mean, Mr. and Mrs. M
probably still hate me.

14:24.397 --> 14:26.575
After a weekend with him,

14:26.599 --> 14:28.211
they'll think that I'm a prince.

14:28.235 --> 14:30.213
Okay. I'm uncomfortable
with this,

14:30.237 --> 14:32.348
and that's a bad
position to put you in.

14:32.372 --> 14:33.282
Yeah, you're right, I don't...

14:33.306 --> 14:35.418
Okay. Just a thought.

14:35.442 --> 14:37.020
Okay.

14:37.044 --> 14:38.654
- Bye.
- Bye.

14:38.678 --> 14:40.623
So where do you want
to go for lunch?

14:40.647 --> 14:42.691
Oh, I know this great new place.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.251
You know what?

14:45.485 --> 14:47.096
I'll do it.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.231
Yeah?

14:48.255 --> 14:49.398
Yeah!

14:49.422 --> 14:51.968
Hey. Anything to help
you lovebirds out.

14:51.992 --> 14:54.503
Alright! Well, we owe you.

14:54.527 --> 14:55.604
What's this?

14:55.628 --> 14:58.007
This is gas money.
It's a long drive.

14:58.031 --> 14:59.375
Oh, no, no. My truck
runs on vegetable oil.

14:59.399 --> 15:00.443
Converted it with a kit.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.045
For vegetable oil, then.

15:02.069 --> 15:03.279
No, I get a free supply

15:03.303 --> 15:05.543
from the Chinese food place
across the street. Thank you.

15:05.567 --> 15:06.415
Okay.

15:06.439 --> 15:08.417
Are you sure you're
okay with this?

15:08.441 --> 15:11.320
When do we leave?

15:11.344 --> 15:13.213
â™ª â™ª

15:16.616 --> 15:18.995
We're going to need more
testing on the sodamaker.

15:19.019 --> 15:21.230
Well, it's just not up
to our standards yet.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.132
Sorry about that.

15:23.156 --> 15:24.600
Boy, it never stops, does it?

15:24.624 --> 15:26.669
That is family business for you.

15:26.693 --> 15:29.238
We have to make it perfect
if it has the Mayfield name.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.607
Personal sodamaker?
Sounds expensive.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.471
You know, you can buy
soda at the dollar store.

15:33.495 --> 15:35.979
Well, I'm sure it's not as good.

15:36.003 --> 15:38.314
No! It's terrible,
but it's a dollar.

15:38.338 --> 15:41.050
Our target market can afford it.

15:41.074 --> 15:43.086
So how is it working
for your dad?

15:43.110 --> 15:44.187
You know,

15:44.211 --> 15:46.255
the less things change, the
more they stay insane.

15:46.279 --> 15:47.556
Change is good.

15:47.580 --> 15:48.524
Sometimes.

15:48.548 --> 15:49.828
It will buy you a
bottle of soda.

15:49.852 --> 15:51.995
Touche.

15:52.019 --> 15:54.397
Thanks again for
coming this weekend.

15:54.421 --> 15:55.531
My pleasure.

15:55.555 --> 15:57.500
We owe you.

15:57.524 --> 15:59.026
Ah, what are friends for?

16:08.368 --> 16:13.040
â™ª â™ª

16:17.344 --> 16:18.554
Are you ready for this?

16:18.578 --> 16:20.513
Absolutely.

16:25.418 --> 16:26.686
We're here!

16:28.255 --> 16:30.290
Hello, dear!

16:31.724 --> 16:33.236
- Hi, daddy.
- Hello, sweetheart.

16:33.260 --> 16:35.171
Mr. and Mrs. M.

16:35.195 --> 16:36.605
- Happy 50th!
- 40th!

16:36.629 --> 16:38.774
Well, 30, 40, 50...

16:38.798 --> 16:40.443
The main thing is,
you're still together,

16:40.467 --> 16:42.445
and so happy.

16:42.469 --> 16:43.546
Who's this?

16:43.570 --> 16:45.381
You remember Gridley,
from high school?

16:45.405 --> 16:47.150
Yes.

16:47.174 --> 16:48.675
Vividly.

16:49.686 --> 16:50.686
- Ah!
- Uh-uh.

16:50.710 --> 16:51.587
Uh...

16:51.611 --> 16:53.222
How do you want to
handle this, Mr. M?

16:53.246 --> 16:54.290
Handshake?

16:54.314 --> 16:55.291
High-five? Knuckle-bump?

16:55.315 --> 16:57.093
Handshake. Um...

16:57.117 --> 17:00.396
Your vehicle, it's,
um, it's leaking oil.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.365
Ahh. Well, no worries.
It's vegetable oil.

17:02.389 --> 17:04.233
A good hosing'll
wash that right off.

17:04.257 --> 17:06.435
Something smells
like Chinese food.

17:06.459 --> 17:07.569
Oh, yeah. That might be me.

17:07.594 --> 17:09.672
Nan-king gardens... Good call.

17:09.695 --> 17:12.474
Well, we appreciate you
bringing Josie home.

17:12.499 --> 17:14.510
Can I get you a glass of
water before you leave?

17:14.534 --> 17:15.854
Oh, no, mother,
he's not leaving.

17:15.877 --> 17:17.579
He's staying for the weekend.

17:17.604 --> 17:18.604
I don't understand.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.684
He's my plus-one.

17:21.708 --> 17:24.577
â™ª â™ª

17:36.389 --> 17:37.833
Ugh. What is this?

17:37.857 --> 17:40.469
We thought you were still
seeing that "Richard" person.

17:40.493 --> 17:41.804
You didn't approve of Richard,

17:41.828 --> 17:43.272
so I started seeing
other people.

17:43.296 --> 17:45.108
He's on the back
burner for right now.

17:45.132 --> 17:47.710
And Maxwell Gridley is
on the front burner?

17:47.734 --> 17:50.179
Yes. I ran into him while
I was out jogging,

17:50.203 --> 17:53.516
and we have a history
together, he makes me laugh!

17:53.540 --> 17:55.184
He has a very contagious
outlook on life.

17:55.208 --> 17:56.885
Let's hope that's all
that's contagious.

17:56.909 --> 18:00.280
â™ª â™ª

18:20.533 --> 18:21.910
Mindy?

18:21.934 --> 18:23.336
Gridley?

18:24.371 --> 18:26.382
Ah!

18:26.406 --> 18:27.816
Hey!

18:27.840 --> 18:28.817
Look at you all grown-up!

18:28.841 --> 18:30.719
You look great!

18:30.743 --> 18:31.983
Oh, you need your eyes checked.

18:32.007 --> 18:33.522
Nah. I'm 20/20.

18:33.546 --> 18:35.624
Are you and Josie, like...

18:35.648 --> 18:36.859
Ah, yes and no.

18:36.883 --> 18:38.194
More "no."

18:38.218 --> 18:39.262
You just getting here?

18:39.286 --> 18:41.697
I wish. Just running errands
for mother superior.

18:41.721 --> 18:43.166
What is that, a weapon?

18:43.190 --> 18:44.267
"Grape scissors."

18:44.291 --> 18:46.326
Ah... crucial.

18:47.560 --> 18:50.506
Okay. Does the driveway
smell like Chinese food?

18:50.530 --> 18:52.432
Come on.

18:54.501 --> 18:55.911
Hiya, sis!

18:55.935 --> 18:57.646
Hey!

18:57.670 --> 18:59.239
Hi!

19:00.473 --> 19:01.850
Honey, you look so good!

19:01.874 --> 19:03.519
Guess who's in town?

19:03.543 --> 19:04.687
Wade Wilson!

19:04.711 --> 19:06.489
- Did you talk to him?
- No, I can't!

19:06.513 --> 19:07.756
Invite him to the party.

19:07.780 --> 19:10.260
Mom would be furious. You know
how she feels about the Wilsons.

19:10.284 --> 19:11.494
So?

19:11.518 --> 19:12.595
Besides, he wouldn't come.

19:12.619 --> 19:14.763
Mrs. M, this place...

19:14.787 --> 19:16.456
It's even better
than I remember.

19:17.590 --> 19:18.634
Oh, wow!

19:18.658 --> 19:19.868
Uh, don't touch that, please.

19:19.892 --> 19:20.869
It's expensive.

19:20.893 --> 19:22.371
It's Faberge.

19:22.395 --> 19:23.595
- Oh.
- Dad gave that to mom...

19:23.619 --> 19:25.208
for their first
wedding anniversary.

19:25.232 --> 19:27.210
Our second anniversary.

19:27.234 --> 19:29.245
Our first anniversary,
we were poor.

19:29.269 --> 19:31.414
Well, poor in money,
rich in love.

19:31.438 --> 19:32.939
Something like that.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.385
Hey, who's this?

19:36.409 --> 19:38.887
He's new.

19:38.911 --> 19:40.556
Rex, come.

19:40.580 --> 19:42.391
Rex?

19:42.415 --> 19:44.693
Come!

19:44.717 --> 19:46.595
Come!

19:46.619 --> 19:49.522
Rex... come!

19:53.860 --> 19:56.529
He doesn't like people.

19:58.331 --> 19:59.675
Oh!

19:59.699 --> 20:01.444
Hey, fella.

20:01.468 --> 20:03.812
There you are.

20:03.836 --> 20:05.348
Oh, that's a good boy.

20:05.372 --> 20:06.382
Hi, Rex.

20:06.406 --> 20:08.584
Hi. Oh!

20:08.608 --> 20:09.909
Hey, fella.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.432
Gridley, you remember
my grandfather, right?

20:14.456 --> 20:15.858
Yes! Of course.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.360
How are you, sir?

20:17.384 --> 20:18.784
You took me fishing
once, remember?

20:20.287 --> 20:22.265
Oh, I love this show!

20:22.289 --> 20:23.832
He doesn't speak.

20:23.856 --> 20:25.734
It's been almost two years now.

20:25.758 --> 20:27.736
Oh? Cool...

20:27.760 --> 20:29.538
Like a vow of silence?

20:29.562 --> 20:31.374
Dementia.

20:31.398 --> 20:33.542
Oh!

20:33.566 --> 20:35.086
Well, who doesn't
have a touch of that?

20:35.110 --> 20:38.447
"Which overweight U.S.
president got stuck

20:38.471 --> 20:39.631
in the presidential bathtub?"

20:39.655 --> 20:41.450
Oh! I know this. I know this...

20:41.474 --> 20:42.385
It's, um...

20:42.409 --> 20:43.852
Wait! Yeah!

20:43.876 --> 20:45.554
William Howard Taft.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.456
Everyone.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.292
I have a thrilling announcement.

20:49.316 --> 20:51.927
It appears patience and hard
work really do pay off.

20:51.951 --> 20:54.430
The Mayfield house has secured

20:54.454 --> 20:55.798
the coveted "beautiful
homes" page

20:55.822 --> 20:57.300
in this Sunday's Chronicle!

20:57.324 --> 20:58.734
Kudos, Mrs. M!

20:58.758 --> 21:00.035
Mom, that is so great.

21:00.059 --> 21:02.471
Yeah. You've wanted
that forever.

21:02.495 --> 21:03.472
Or at least since

21:03.496 --> 21:05.541
the Wilsons' house was selected.

21:05.565 --> 21:06.575
There you go.

21:06.599 --> 21:07.710
The Wilsons, huh?

21:07.734 --> 21:09.412
They still live next door?

21:09.436 --> 21:10.579
Unfortunately.

21:10.603 --> 21:11.871
He doesn't drink.

21:17.510 --> 21:18.921
Well, at any rate,

21:18.945 --> 21:20.723
the photographer will
be here tomorrow night

21:20.747 --> 21:22.491
to shoot the party.

21:22.515 --> 21:24.527
And it goes without saying,

21:24.551 --> 21:26.495
everything has to look perfect.

21:26.519 --> 21:28.697
And when hasn't it?

21:28.721 --> 21:30.590
Thank you, dear.

21:31.758 --> 21:33.101
To the Mayfields!

21:33.125 --> 21:34.102
To the Chronicle.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.328
To Josie and Gridley.

21:39.799 --> 21:41.510
Mm! I almost forgot.

21:41.534 --> 21:43.503
I brought presents.

21:44.637 --> 21:46.048
That isn't necessary.

21:46.072 --> 21:47.072
Ah...

21:49.075 --> 21:50.853
Hey, this really
isn't necessary.

21:50.877 --> 21:52.078
Ah, it's no problem.

21:54.547 --> 21:56.392
Alright!

21:56.416 --> 21:58.827
Mindy...

21:58.851 --> 22:02.422
This is for welcoming me
so warmly into your home.

22:03.856 --> 22:05.892
Sir.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.673
I remembered how
much you liked hats.

22:10.697 --> 22:12.297
That's your favorite
color, if I recall?

22:12.321 --> 22:13.642
Thanks, Gridley.

22:13.666 --> 22:16.603
Go on. I think you're
gonna like it.

22:19.772 --> 22:21.774
I know you love the canines.

22:23.743 --> 22:25.912
Oh... he looks
exactly like Prince.

22:28.415 --> 22:29.692
Who's Prince?

22:29.716 --> 22:31.494
It's her favorite dog.
He died last year.

22:31.518 --> 22:33.596
Oh, that's terrible! Should I...

22:33.620 --> 22:35.664
No.

22:35.688 --> 22:38.133
Oh, uh...

22:38.157 --> 22:40.903
Bet you haven't seen one
of those in a while, huh?

22:40.927 --> 22:42.671
No, I haven't.

22:42.695 --> 22:45.465
Quite unexpected.

22:48.134 --> 22:49.912
Hey, come on over here. Come on.

22:49.936 --> 22:51.614
That's a good boy.

22:51.638 --> 22:53.882
Mrs. M, I am so
sorry about Prince.

22:53.906 --> 22:56.509
Let's just not talk
about it, shall we?

22:57.644 --> 22:59.579
Come on. Let go.

23:12.625 --> 23:14.670
I am so sorry! I'll clean it up.

23:14.694 --> 23:15.795
No! I've got it!

23:21.668 --> 23:23.546
And take off that
ridiculous hat.

23:23.570 --> 23:26.573
â™ª â™ª

23:32.479 --> 23:33.813
Look what he's done to you!

23:38.651 --> 23:40.011
I rented a tux in
that color once.

23:40.035 --> 23:41.229
Yes. We remember.

23:41.253 --> 23:42.465
I think it looks festive.

23:42.489 --> 23:44.423
Go wash that out right now.

23:45.725 --> 23:47.770
Can you please

23:47.794 --> 23:49.705
give us a moment alone
with our daughter?

23:49.729 --> 23:50.939
Of course.

23:50.963 --> 23:52.841
And don't touch
anything in there!

23:52.865 --> 23:54.242
It's for the party.

23:54.266 --> 23:56.202
Roger that.

23:59.205 --> 24:01.216
What were you thinking,
bringing him here?

24:01.240 --> 24:03.085
I don't even have
a word for him!

24:03.109 --> 24:05.044
Well, I'm sure
you'll think of one.

24:11.050 --> 24:12.761
It's a "big-mouth bass."

24:12.785 --> 24:15.263
For the fisherman in all of us.

24:15.287 --> 24:17.223
May I?

24:22.862 --> 24:27.042
â™ª Way down upon the
Swanee River â™ª

24:27.066 --> 24:30.269
â™ª Far, far away â™ª

24:37.844 --> 24:40.155
Well, let's begin, shall we?

24:40.179 --> 24:42.958
Bon appetit.

24:42.982 --> 24:44.462
Well, I don't know
about anyone else,

24:44.486 --> 24:45.728
but I could eat a horse.

24:45.752 --> 24:46.753
Or a camel.

24:48.154 --> 24:50.966
I thought I told you
to wash that out?

24:50.990 --> 24:52.901
I tried, it wouldn't come out.

24:52.925 --> 24:53.936
Well, it better not

24:53.960 --> 24:55.120
look like that tomorrow night

24:55.144 --> 24:55.988
when the photographer gets here.

24:56.012 --> 24:57.973
It's not the end of
the world, Claire.

24:57.997 --> 24:59.274
Maxwell?

24:59.298 --> 25:01.309
I assume you have appropriate
attire for the party

25:01.333 --> 25:02.711
tomorrow night?

25:02.735 --> 25:04.375
Don't worry, Mrs. M I
won't embarrass you.

25:04.399 --> 25:06.314
Learned that lesson at prom.

25:06.338 --> 25:09.818
Nevertheless, Mr. Mayfield will
lend you a jacket and a tie.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.119
Ooh! Quite the selection.

25:11.143 --> 25:12.223
You will have 30 dark suits

25:12.247 --> 25:14.823
and 30 matching ties
to choose from.

25:14.847 --> 25:16.124
Your father has always
been a creature of habit,

25:16.148 --> 25:17.092
haven't you, dear?

25:17.116 --> 25:18.918
Not always.

25:27.326 --> 25:28.971
Well, this chicken is fantastic.

25:28.995 --> 25:30.238
It's cornish game hen.

25:30.262 --> 25:31.807
It's a bit dry.

25:31.831 --> 25:33.909
It's like I always make it.

25:33.933 --> 25:36.302
Yes. It is.

25:39.238 --> 25:43.085
Tell me, Maxwell, what exactly
do you do for a living?

25:43.109 --> 25:45.821
- And the inquisition begins.
- Well, to be honest...

25:45.845 --> 25:46.889
there aren't enough
hours in the day

25:46.913 --> 25:48.256
to do everything I'd like to do.

25:48.280 --> 25:49.758
And what might those things be?

25:49.782 --> 25:51.550
Gridley works with
driftwood, dad.

25:52.752 --> 25:54.329
There's a living in that?

25:54.353 --> 25:57.265
Well, my income ebbs and
flows with the tide.

25:57.289 --> 25:59.101
Just like our business, dad.

25:59.125 --> 26:01.125
But I can't say enough good
things about driftwood.

26:01.149 --> 26:04.452
It's got character, it won't rot, and...
it's free!

26:07.199 --> 26:08.944
Of course, I do have
other ventures.

26:08.968 --> 26:10.646
Topiary. And I teach

26:10.670 --> 26:12.190
water aerobics at the
community center

26:12.214 --> 26:13.415
on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

26:14.941 --> 26:17.910
Driftwood, topiary
and water aerobics.

26:19.145 --> 26:20.889
Hmm. It appears you're
a triple-threat.

26:20.913 --> 26:22.782
Thank you.

26:24.150 --> 26:26.653
Mindy... do you
really need that?

26:29.088 --> 26:32.058
Don't put it back. You've
already touched it.

26:33.993 --> 26:36.138
There's more for you
and me, gramps.

26:36.162 --> 26:39.107
Maxwell, you'll be staying
in the yellow room tonight.

26:39.131 --> 26:40.876
The yellow room? Where's that?

26:40.900 --> 26:43.211
It is as far from my
bedroom as possible,

26:43.235 --> 26:44.336
without being outdoors.

26:46.305 --> 26:48.641
â™ª â™ª

26:55.782 --> 26:57.622
I don't know what in the
world she sees in him.

26:57.646 --> 27:00.763
I should never have told her
that I didn't like Richard.

27:00.787 --> 27:03.055
Oh! Richard's a dream
compared to this one.

27:04.190 --> 27:06.625
â™ª â™ª

27:10.162 --> 27:13.041
Okay, so what is going on

27:13.065 --> 27:14.877
with you and Gridley?

27:14.901 --> 27:16.178
I have to be honest with you,

27:16.202 --> 27:18.146
out of all the guys that
you ever brought home,

27:18.170 --> 27:20.716
he's the only one that
I ever really liked.

27:20.740 --> 27:22.260
Alright, I'm gonna
tell you something,

27:22.284 --> 27:23.886
but you do not say a
word to mom and dad.

27:23.910 --> 27:24.953
Are we clear?

27:24.977 --> 27:26.121
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

27:26.145 --> 27:29.157
He's just here to make
Richard look better.

27:29.181 --> 27:30.292
What?

27:30.316 --> 27:32.356
He's doing me a favor. You
know how mom and dad are.

27:35.755 --> 27:37.790
You're really gonna
like Richard.

27:39.258 --> 27:42.437
Okay, well, uh...
What is he like?

27:42.461 --> 27:45.440
Well, he's sharp
and really driven,

27:45.464 --> 27:46.842
and good-looking.

27:46.866 --> 27:49.001
So... he's you.

27:55.041 --> 27:57.376
Definitely yellow.

28:02.849 --> 28:04.492
Oh, there's nothin'
to see in there, pal,

28:04.516 --> 28:05.928
but I did bring you

28:05.952 --> 28:08.463
a little treat from
the dinner table.

28:08.487 --> 28:10.265
Come here!

28:10.289 --> 28:12.091
There you go.

28:15.795 --> 28:17.773
I think today went pretty well.

28:17.797 --> 28:19.875
Sort of.

28:19.899 --> 28:21.243
I mean, as long
as Josie's happy,

28:21.267 --> 28:22.835
I'm golden, right?

28:24.804 --> 28:26.114
What do you think, Rex?

28:26.138 --> 28:28.083
Did I pull it off?

28:28.107 --> 28:30.342
Oh! You're easy.

28:36.315 --> 28:38.484
â™ª â™ª

28:42.388 --> 28:43.966
Oh, dear.

28:43.990 --> 28:46.201
Is one of your daughters
dating a handyman?

28:46.225 --> 28:48.503
I hear your son's in town.

28:48.527 --> 28:51.173
I hope he hasn't
flunked out already.

28:51.197 --> 28:54.209
Quite the opposite. He's a
perfect fit for an Ivy.

28:54.233 --> 28:55.210
Joseph went to Yale.

28:55.234 --> 28:56.311
Really?

28:56.335 --> 28:57.913
And now he sells wooden spoons.

28:57.937 --> 28:59.281
A lot of them.

28:59.305 --> 29:00.940
Hmph.

29:11.383 --> 29:13.452
Just saw that dreadful
Audrey Wilson.

29:14.887 --> 29:17.232
Here's your egglette
and bagelette, dear.

29:17.256 --> 29:19.234
Photographer's coming at 6:00.

29:19.258 --> 29:21.870
I'll never have
everything ready in time.

29:21.894 --> 29:22.805
I don't know why

29:22.829 --> 29:24.429
you insist on doing
everything yourself.

29:24.453 --> 29:25.240
Because that way,

29:25.264 --> 29:26.875
I'll know things
will be done right.

29:26.899 --> 29:28.367
I'm sure everything
will be fine.

29:30.602 --> 29:32.114
Morning, Mrs. M.

29:32.138 --> 29:33.548
Mr. M.

29:33.572 --> 29:35.292
Rex and I were just
about to go for a walk.

29:35.316 --> 29:36.318
The dog'll get filthy.

29:36.342 --> 29:37.502
I'll have to bathe him again!

29:37.526 --> 29:38.586
It's a dog, Claire.

29:38.610 --> 29:40.889
Rex, dear, come.

29:40.913 --> 29:42.390
Rex...

29:42.414 --> 29:43.950
Come!

29:46.585 --> 29:48.120
Rex! Come on, boy.

29:51.490 --> 29:53.068
Whoa-ho!

29:53.092 --> 29:54.336
Oh, no!

29:54.360 --> 29:56.362
Oh!

30:07.173 --> 30:08.951
What have you done?

30:08.975 --> 30:11.086
It wasn't me, it was...

30:11.110 --> 30:12.955
What am I talking about?

30:12.979 --> 30:15.523
It was totally my fault.
I am so sorry!

30:15.547 --> 30:16.859
It's not so bad...

30:16.883 --> 30:18.217
The tray is fine.

30:19.886 --> 30:21.463
This is a nightmare.

30:21.487 --> 30:23.298
Mom! It's an accident.
It's just a cake.

30:23.322 --> 30:26.401
No, this was my signature
Dulce de Leche cake,

30:26.425 --> 30:28.403
that was going to be
featured in the Chronicle.

30:28.427 --> 30:30.038
I can fix this.

30:30.062 --> 30:32.074
Oh, you can't imagine my relief!

30:32.098 --> 30:34.242
Just give me an hour. Two, tops.

30:34.266 --> 30:35.543
Why not take half an hour?

30:35.567 --> 30:38.380
Or 15 minutes? After all, I only
spend half the night baking it!

30:38.404 --> 30:39.948
Claire...

30:39.972 --> 30:42.150
Call Village Bakery. I'm
sure they can do something.

30:42.174 --> 30:43.351
Oh, better yet,

30:43.375 --> 30:45.053
why don't I send Mindy
to the supermarket

30:45.077 --> 30:47.079
to get a frozen pie?

30:48.314 --> 30:49.314
Claire!

30:51.183 --> 30:53.095
Are you protecting Rex?

30:53.119 --> 30:54.453
Hey, he's got to live here.

30:56.122 --> 30:58.157
Poor Rex.

31:01.928 --> 31:04.973
I'm gonna fix this cake.
Any ideas?

31:04.997 --> 31:06.408
Oh, I don't bake, I don't cook.

31:06.432 --> 31:08.143
I can't even use a
lemon squeezer.

31:08.167 --> 31:09.368
Oh!

31:15.307 --> 31:18.120
I haven't had a Twinkie
since we were little kids!

31:18.144 --> 31:19.521
Yeah, I bought them on sale.

31:19.545 --> 31:21.423
Look, Gridley, you
don't have to do this.

31:21.447 --> 31:25.260
Yeah... I do.

31:25.284 --> 31:26.929
The point was to
change her mind,

31:26.953 --> 31:28.263
not break her heart.

31:28.287 --> 31:29.287
Look alive.

31:30.456 --> 31:32.424
She's not gonna like it.

31:33.659 --> 31:35.971
We'll see.

31:35.995 --> 31:37.339
Oops! You got it?

31:37.363 --> 31:38.406
Yep, beautiful. Perfect.

31:38.430 --> 31:39.474
Do you want it level

31:39.498 --> 31:40.475
or do you want it staggered?

31:40.499 --> 31:42.177
Do it level, slightly staggered,

31:42.201 --> 31:43.478
a little cantilever.

31:43.502 --> 31:45.280
It's like the arch
we made for prom.

31:45.304 --> 31:46.481
Oh, yeah! That was awesome.

31:46.505 --> 31:48.216
It was awesome till it fell

31:48.240 --> 31:49.952
on all those poor
little juniors.

31:49.976 --> 31:52.387
Oh, yeah! That was awesome.

31:52.411 --> 31:54.389
Stop it.

31:54.413 --> 31:55.533
Alright, where does this go?

31:55.557 --> 31:58.160
Tell me that isn't the same tree

31:58.184 --> 31:59.227
that I, uh...

31:59.251 --> 32:00.428
TP'd?

32:00.452 --> 32:01.629
You knew?

32:01.653 --> 32:03.398
- Yeah, I knew!
- Did your folks know?

32:03.422 --> 32:06.034
Oh, no, they blamed
Wade Wilson for years!

32:06.058 --> 32:07.102
Oh! Wade Wilson!

32:07.126 --> 32:08.703
Whatever happened to that brat?

32:08.727 --> 32:10.538
That's "Dr. Brat" to you, sir.

32:10.562 --> 32:12.307
He's is first-year med school.

32:12.331 --> 32:14.076
Well, I knew he'd never
amount to anything!

32:14.100 --> 32:15.277
Right.

32:15.301 --> 32:16.941
You remember that trick
that I used to do?

32:16.965 --> 32:17.679
Don't do it!

32:17.703 --> 32:18.983
- You remember it?
- Don't do it.

32:19.007 --> 32:20.448
You mean this one? This trick?

32:20.472 --> 32:21.583
- So annoying!
- This trick?

32:21.607 --> 32:23.167
- It's like the most annoying...
- Look!

32:23.191 --> 32:24.286
Ohh!

32:24.310 --> 32:26.654
- You did not...
- Stop it! Be an adult!

32:26.678 --> 32:28.647
Stop! My phone's ringing.

32:31.317 --> 32:33.761
Richard! Hi. How's golf?

32:33.785 --> 32:35.530
What's in your hair?

32:35.554 --> 32:38.433
Huh? Do I have frosting... I
have frosting in my hair.

32:38.457 --> 32:40.602
Um, uh, Gridley's making a cake.

32:40.626 --> 32:42.437
Really? So...

32:42.461 --> 32:44.272
Things are going well then?

32:44.296 --> 32:45.473
Mm! Mm-hmm. Fantastic.

32:45.497 --> 32:46.741
Yeah. They hate me.

32:46.765 --> 32:48.610
They do! They hate you so much.

32:48.634 --> 32:50.312
- Hey!
- Ahh!

32:50.336 --> 32:52.080
Honey, I gotta call
you back, okay?

32:52.104 --> 32:53.304
Clock is ticking on this cake.

32:53.328 --> 32:54.863
- Bye-bye!
- Sure...

33:01.213 --> 33:04.026
Mom! What do you think?

33:04.050 --> 33:06.128
Well, it's not my cake,
but I suppose it will do.

33:06.152 --> 33:07.792
I can give you the
recipe, if you'd like.

33:07.816 --> 33:09.231
That will not be necessary.

33:09.255 --> 33:10.632
Dodged a bullet there, huh?

33:10.656 --> 33:12.134
Could you please
put down that toy?

33:12.158 --> 33:13.801
It's annoying.

33:13.825 --> 33:17.263
Okay, girls, follow me.
We have work to do.

33:18.530 --> 33:21.276
Anyone up for a walk?

33:21.300 --> 33:22.444
No, thank you.

33:22.468 --> 33:24.246
Maybe I'll take granddad, then.

33:24.270 --> 33:25.747
He won't go.

33:25.771 --> 33:26.781
Okay. Rex?

33:26.805 --> 33:28.083
He won't go either.

33:28.107 --> 33:30.709
Alright. Guess
I'll go by myself.

33:34.313 --> 33:36.482
â™ª â™ª

33:43.622 --> 33:45.657
â™ª â™ª

33:53.632 --> 33:55.510
I always loved this town.

33:55.534 --> 33:58.513
I grew up near the gas
station up on hill.

33:58.537 --> 34:00.282
Wasn't the most
glamorous address,

34:00.306 --> 34:01.746
but we did have nice,
big old trees.

34:01.770 --> 34:04.219
Oak.

34:04.243 --> 34:06.154
They're sycamore trees.

34:06.178 --> 34:08.156
Yeah.

34:08.179 --> 34:10.558
Good call on that William
Howard Taft, though.

34:10.581 --> 34:12.427
Wait!

34:12.451 --> 34:14.696
I... I thought you didn't talk.

34:14.719 --> 34:15.797
Dementia or...

34:15.821 --> 34:16.831
Oh, no, no, no, no.

34:16.855 --> 34:18.800
I'm-I'm-I'm sharp
as a tack, yeah.

34:18.824 --> 34:20.101
Yeah.

34:20.126 --> 34:22.060
This way, I get to
tune everybody out.

34:23.329 --> 34:25.097
But that's...

34:28.467 --> 34:29.877
That's genius!

34:29.900 --> 34:31.746
Who else knows about this?

34:31.770 --> 34:34.449
Nobody, and I want
to keep it that way.

34:34.473 --> 34:36.418
My lips are sealed.

34:36.442 --> 34:37.676
Time to turn around.

34:42.348 --> 34:44.759
But what about Josie and Mindy?

34:44.783 --> 34:47.629
Ah, that's a tough one.

34:47.652 --> 34:49.464
Collateral damage, I guess.

34:49.487 --> 34:53.225
But don't worry... I'll
make up for it in my will.

34:58.597 --> 35:00.666
- Ready?
- Yep.

35:02.768 --> 35:04.846
I thought the party was inside.

35:04.870 --> 35:08.150
Oh, it's just in case
someone looks out a window.

35:08.174 --> 35:09.617
What are we doing?

35:09.641 --> 35:12.187
Re-arranging the deck
chairs on the Titanic.

35:12.211 --> 35:14.156
I wanted to mention to you

35:14.180 --> 35:15.340
that Richard really does have

35:15.364 --> 35:16.458
a lot of great contacts.

35:16.482 --> 35:18.293
So if you're ever
looking for, like, a...

35:18.317 --> 35:19.161
A real job?

35:19.185 --> 35:20.785
Well, I mean, it's not
like you need one,

35:20.809 --> 35:23.365
but should the driftwood
thing ever drift away...

35:23.389 --> 35:26.501
I'll call Richard Wright of
Wright, silver, and gunk.

35:26.525 --> 35:27.569
That's gumm.

35:27.593 --> 35:28.903
- What?
- Gumm?

35:28.927 --> 35:30.729
Oh, no, thanks. Trying to quit.

35:32.264 --> 35:34.576
Hey, I'm sorry about
the green hair.

35:34.600 --> 35:38.180
Actually, I owe you an apology.

35:38.204 --> 35:39.681
I lied. It does come out.

35:39.705 --> 35:41.216
What?

35:41.240 --> 35:42.384
I like having green hair.

35:42.408 --> 35:43.918
Makes me feel like
I'm someone else.

35:43.942 --> 35:48.490
Mindy, why would you want
to be somebody else?

35:48.514 --> 35:50.858
Uh, because I'm invisible.
In this family.

35:50.882 --> 35:52.694
I'm like an afterthought.

35:52.718 --> 35:53.728
That's not true.

35:53.752 --> 35:55.230
Come on, Josie.

35:55.254 --> 35:57.765
You've always been the favorite.

35:57.789 --> 35:59.667
You're the go-getter, like dad,

35:59.691 --> 36:02.370
and I'm the Mayfield
black sheep.

36:02.394 --> 36:03.429
Or the green sheep.

36:04.930 --> 36:06.774
Alright, look, you're not

36:06.798 --> 36:08.638
supposed to know what
you're doing at this age.

36:08.662 --> 36:09.644
Well, you did.

36:09.668 --> 36:11.870
But you're in college still.

36:14.473 --> 36:15.750
I dropped out.

36:15.774 --> 36:17.419
Mindy... when?

36:17.443 --> 36:19.287
Last year.

36:19.311 --> 36:21.223
Please don't tell
mom and dad, okay?

36:21.247 --> 36:22.890
They're just gonna freak out.

36:22.914 --> 36:24.392
Look, I have a job.

36:24.416 --> 36:27.429
At a coffeehouse.
I'm singing there.

36:27.453 --> 36:29.731
The thing is...

36:29.755 --> 36:31.333
I want to be a singer.

36:31.357 --> 36:32.934
Like...

36:32.958 --> 36:34.969
I know how incredibly
stupid that sounds...

36:34.993 --> 36:37.305
No, it's not. It's not stupid.

36:37.329 --> 36:38.373
Really?

36:38.397 --> 36:39.474
No, remember?

36:39.498 --> 36:40.898
We used to goof
around all the time.

36:40.922 --> 36:42.344
Singing the oldies.

36:42.368 --> 36:44.812
â™ª Won't you come
home Bill Bailey? â™ª

36:44.836 --> 36:46.481
Yeah, but I was 8.

36:46.505 --> 36:48.350
How come you didn't
tell me this before?

36:48.374 --> 36:50.785
I don't know.

36:50.809 --> 36:52.620
I guess I just assumed
you wouldn't approve.

36:52.644 --> 36:55.281
That's crazy! Why
wouldn't I approve?

36:56.448 --> 37:00.328
Uh... because you have an MBA,

37:00.352 --> 37:02.430
and you went straight
into the family business,

37:02.454 --> 37:05.733
and you pretty much haven't made
a misstep since you could walk.

37:05.757 --> 37:07.935
Mindy.

37:07.959 --> 37:09.904
You are a great singer.

37:09.928 --> 37:11.105
You always have been,

37:11.129 --> 37:14.041
and I'm really, really proud
of you for doing this, okay?

37:14.065 --> 37:16.411
That other stuff, that's dad,
that's stuff he cares about,

37:16.435 --> 37:17.669
not me.

37:19.070 --> 37:21.616
Wait. Are you saying
that I'm like dad?

37:21.640 --> 37:23.309
Heads up!

37:24.910 --> 37:26.578
Geez!

37:32.651 --> 37:34.586
â™ª â™ª

37:36.522 --> 37:38.366
It's Wade Wilson.

37:38.390 --> 37:39.434
What?

37:39.458 --> 37:40.702
It's Wade Wilson. What do I do?

37:40.726 --> 37:41.969
We gotta throw it back.

37:41.993 --> 37:43.705
You hand it back.

37:43.729 --> 37:45.307
And then what do I do?

37:45.331 --> 37:47.542
Well, just think about
what your mother would do,

37:47.566 --> 37:49.301
and do the exact opposite.

37:50.402 --> 37:51.579
Okay. Now.

37:51.603 --> 37:52.847
- No! No...
- Yes. Yes.

37:52.871 --> 37:54.773
Yes. Good luck.

37:56.608 --> 37:59.445
We should probably go.

38:04.850 --> 38:06.428
Mindy?

38:06.452 --> 38:07.853
Hey...

38:08.987 --> 38:09.997
Thanks.

38:10.021 --> 38:11.866
You're welcome.

38:11.890 --> 38:13.559
I like your hair.

38:15.527 --> 38:16.662
Thanks.

38:17.863 --> 38:19.441
Is that Gridley?

38:19.465 --> 38:20.942
Yeah.

38:20.966 --> 38:23.110
That guy got me blamed
for TP'ing your yard!

38:23.134 --> 38:25.813
Yeah. I think there's still
some left up on our roof.

38:25.837 --> 38:27.415
Hey,

38:27.439 --> 38:29.451
so, um, how much longer
are you in town for?

38:29.475 --> 38:31.786
Just the weekend. You?

38:31.810 --> 38:33.955
Oh, just until my
parents' party is over.

38:33.979 --> 38:35.857
We weren't invited.

38:35.881 --> 38:37.683
Oh, lucky you.

38:39.451 --> 38:41.496
What have you been
doing in school?

38:41.520 --> 38:43.422
Oh, you know...

38:44.823 --> 38:47.025
Come on, let's give these
kids some privacy.

38:48.960 --> 38:51.406
Hey, you don't think I'm
like my dad, do you?

38:51.430 --> 38:53.140
Nah. You're way prettier.

38:53.164 --> 38:55.610
Maybe a little.

38:55.634 --> 38:56.611
I could be wrong.

38:56.635 --> 38:57.579
No. You're right.

38:57.603 --> 38:58.883
I mean, he's like a Swiss watch,

38:58.907 --> 39:00.014
and I suppose I am, too.

39:00.038 --> 39:02.584
I haven't had a spontaneous
moment in forever.

39:02.608 --> 39:04.118
Hey! You invited me home.
He wouldn't have done that.

39:04.142 --> 39:05.853
Oh, Richard invited
you home, actually.

39:05.877 --> 39:07.557
And I got through the
front door this time.

39:07.581 --> 39:09.382
Good work.

39:11.550 --> 39:14.662
"Dulce de Leche?"

39:14.686 --> 39:16.788
I think we just found your
mom's "signature" cake.

39:18.824 --> 39:19.967
It's from a bakery.

39:19.991 --> 39:21.551
I cannot believe that,
all these years,

39:21.575 --> 39:22.975
she's been pretending
to make this.

39:23.995 --> 39:25.635
I mean, what am I saying?
Of course I can.

39:25.659 --> 39:27.094
Let's put it back.

39:29.968 --> 39:31.946
Who's out there?

39:31.970 --> 39:34.181
It's just me...

39:34.205 --> 39:36.007
Wade Wilson!

39:38.977 --> 39:40.746
What are you doing?

39:47.052 --> 39:48.863
Alright, alright, but
what about the time.

39:48.887 --> 39:50.689
Mrs. L put on the panda suit?

39:53.091 --> 39:55.661
And she was...

39:57.463 --> 39:58.873
It was so dumb!

39:58.897 --> 40:01.509
She was a good teacher.

40:01.533 --> 40:02.944
Aw, she was alright.

40:02.968 --> 40:06.113
Oh, man. How many times
did we skip chemistry

40:06.137 --> 40:07.915
to play frisbee?

40:07.939 --> 40:10.151
Well, it's because the
auditorium window

40:10.175 --> 40:11.853
was always loose...
They made it too easy.

40:11.877 --> 40:13.812
Probably still is.

40:15.514 --> 40:17.692
Now?

40:17.716 --> 40:19.618
â™ª â™ª

40:37.603 --> 40:39.246
Shh. Come on.

40:39.270 --> 40:41.106
Maybe there's another
open window.

40:49.214 --> 40:51.182
I'll go.

40:53.051 --> 40:55.062
I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go.

40:55.086 --> 40:56.154
Okay.

40:58.590 --> 40:59.758
Oh, my god.

41:03.529 --> 41:05.163
- Watch out.
- Sorry.

41:06.965 --> 41:07.975
We did it!

41:07.999 --> 41:09.210
Get the door.

41:09.234 --> 41:11.169
Okay.

41:14.305 --> 41:16.474
â™ª â™ª

41:22.914 --> 41:24.816
Good work.

41:27.018 --> 41:28.029
Ah.

41:28.053 --> 41:29.555
It's so small.

41:32.090 --> 41:34.301
- Nice!
- Yes.

41:34.325 --> 41:37.004
I'm home!

41:37.028 --> 41:38.988
I wonder if they got the
number back on my locker.

41:39.012 --> 41:39.841
No.

41:39.865 --> 41:41.909
- No! Numberless.
- Is it?

41:41.933 --> 41:43.493
And they took the green
day sticker off.

41:43.517 --> 41:45.179
How dare they?

41:45.203 --> 41:46.714
- Right?
- Ruined!

41:46.738 --> 41:48.149
Where are our pictures?

41:48.173 --> 41:49.684
Are they in the trophy case?

41:49.708 --> 41:51.318
We have to look.

41:51.342 --> 41:52.702
I mean, we were a
pretty big deal.

41:52.726 --> 41:54.628
I mean, pretty big!

42:00.051 --> 42:01.629
No, this is sports.
That was not...

42:01.653 --> 42:03.373
We weren't even allowed
to look at this one.

42:03.397 --> 42:03.998
Not us.

42:04.022 --> 42:05.800
Gridley! Here we are!

42:05.824 --> 42:08.936
"Senior Prom Decorating
Committee." Look at that.

42:08.960 --> 42:10.905
Aw!

42:10.929 --> 42:12.940
Why did you let me wear
my hair like that?

42:12.964 --> 42:14.041
It's awful!

42:14.065 --> 42:15.042
Well, clearly,
hair was my thing.

42:15.066 --> 42:17.612
Well... no, you were captain
of building things.

42:17.636 --> 42:20.114
Yeah. And sometimes,
they even stayed up.

42:20.138 --> 42:22.684
It was all so much fun.

42:22.708 --> 42:24.218
What happened? Why
did we lose touch?

42:24.242 --> 42:26.120
We were such great friends.

42:26.144 --> 42:28.756
I don't know. Life
goes on, I guess.

42:28.780 --> 42:31.292
You went to Wharton,
I went to Walmart.

42:31.316 --> 42:32.994
Hey, what did
happen with school?

42:33.018 --> 42:34.796
I mean, you had
really good grades.

42:34.820 --> 42:36.540
Yeah, I went. For a year.
Got a scholarship.

42:36.564 --> 42:37.632
Where?

42:37.656 --> 42:39.100
M.I.T. Engineering.

42:39.124 --> 42:41.636
Gridley, you did not
drop out of M.I.T.

42:41.660 --> 42:43.137
Well, you know, my mom got sick,

42:43.161 --> 42:46.140
and I wanted to help out,
and then, after she died,

42:46.164 --> 42:47.875
I just kind of lost
interest in school.

42:47.899 --> 42:49.243
Hey, I didn't know any of that.

42:49.267 --> 42:50.344
I'm sorry. That's horrible.

42:50.368 --> 42:52.079
It's alright. I...

42:52.103 --> 42:53.748
It pushed me in
another direction.

42:53.772 --> 42:55.883
I groomed horses in Kentucky.

42:55.907 --> 42:57.985
I taught english in Guatemala.

42:58.009 --> 43:00.354
I did ski patrol in Utah,

43:00.378 --> 43:01.923
I even crewed a lobster
boat in Maine.

43:01.947 --> 43:02.990
Won't be doing that again.

43:03.014 --> 43:04.015
- Oh!
- I know.

43:05.083 --> 43:06.794
You've lived, like... 10 lives.

43:06.818 --> 43:07.962
I can barely manage one.

43:07.986 --> 43:10.331
Oh, I think you're
managing pretty well.

43:10.355 --> 43:12.133
I should've defended
you back then.

43:12.157 --> 43:13.200
No. It's alright.

43:13.224 --> 43:14.936
It's not.

43:14.960 --> 43:16.671
I mean, it did bother me

43:16.695 --> 43:18.615
that your parents didn't
think I was good enough.

43:18.639 --> 43:20.074
But it was a long time ago.

43:20.098 --> 43:22.167
They were wrong.
They're wrong now.

43:25.003 --> 43:27.849
I'm sorry. I want you to know that.
I'm...

43:27.873 --> 43:29.283
I'm really sorry.

43:29.307 --> 43:32.377
Apology accepted.

43:34.312 --> 43:36.323
Oh!

43:36.347 --> 43:37.347
â™ª â™ª

43:39.951 --> 43:42.053
Go, go!

43:45.056 --> 43:47.859
â™ª â™ª

43:59.470 --> 44:01.015
I'm sorry to interrupt.

44:01.039 --> 44:03.084
Apparently, I'm supposed
to borrow a dark suit,

44:03.108 --> 44:05.176
a white shirt, and a tie.

44:08.947 --> 44:10.424
You winning?

44:10.448 --> 44:13.118
And losing.

44:23.394 --> 44:25.030
Rook to queen's bishop.

44:26.865 --> 44:30.011
I wouldn't have taken
you for a chess player.

44:30.035 --> 44:31.813
Well, my dad taught me.

44:31.837 --> 44:34.172
Hmm. Pull up a chair.

44:35.907 --> 44:38.452
What does your dad
do for a living?

44:38.476 --> 44:39.921
Mechanic.

44:39.945 --> 44:41.422
Actually, he fixed
your car once.

44:41.446 --> 44:43.815
He worked at the
station up on hill.

44:45.047 --> 44:46.127
Yeah, it's a long time ago,

44:46.151 --> 44:47.294
you probably don't remember.

44:47.318 --> 44:49.420
Big guy, red hair.

44:50.956 --> 44:51.966
That was him.

44:51.990 --> 44:53.300
I do remember.

44:53.324 --> 44:56.070
He did a really good job.

44:56.094 --> 44:57.739
Very reasonable, too.

44:57.763 --> 44:59.173
That he was.

44:59.197 --> 45:00.474
He still working?

45:00.498 --> 45:01.743
Ah, a little.

45:01.767 --> 45:03.277
Moved to Florida
after my mom died.

45:03.301 --> 45:05.012
- Aw, I'm sorry.
- Nah.

45:05.036 --> 45:07.782
They had a lot of
good years together.

45:07.806 --> 45:09.483
Not as many as you and Mrs. M.

45:09.507 --> 45:12.210
We've had a lot of
years, I'll say that.

45:13.278 --> 45:15.156
40.

45:15.180 --> 45:17.491
That's a lifetime.

45:17.515 --> 45:19.217
Sometimes, it feels
like two lifetimes.

45:22.553 --> 45:25.466
She's working really hard
to make this party nice.

45:25.490 --> 45:27.534
It must mean a lot to her.

45:27.558 --> 45:29.536
What means a lot to Claire

45:29.560 --> 45:31.305
is getting on the cover
of the Chronicle.

45:31.329 --> 45:33.975
Your move.

45:33.999 --> 45:36.043
Uh, by the way, thank
you for the slinky.

45:36.067 --> 45:38.279
It, uh... Well, it reminds me

45:38.303 --> 45:40.848
of a time when things
weren't so ordered.

45:40.872 --> 45:43.374
You're welcome.

45:44.509 --> 45:45.844
Check.

45:46.945 --> 45:50.148
You know, it's good manners
to let your host win.

45:51.482 --> 45:53.885
Not a chance.

45:57.288 --> 46:00.125
â™ª â™ª

46:09.467 --> 46:11.578
Wow!

46:11.602 --> 46:12.914
You look...

46:12.938 --> 46:14.215
Like my mother?

46:14.239 --> 46:15.316
Well, I was going
to say beautiful,

46:15.340 --> 46:16.183
but yeah, that works.

46:16.207 --> 46:18.352
Well, look at you,
you're just like...

46:18.376 --> 46:21.088
The C.E.O. Of "Driftwood, Inc."

46:21.112 --> 46:22.323
Full-windsor, half-windsor,

46:22.347 --> 46:24.058
eldredge, or cape knot?

46:24.082 --> 46:25.159
What?

46:25.183 --> 46:26.663
Half-windsor is the
new full windsor.

46:26.687 --> 46:28.395
Eldredge is the
new half-windsor.

46:28.419 --> 46:29.596
Oh, it's a tough call.

46:29.620 --> 46:31.156
Eldredge.

46:34.559 --> 46:35.793
Handsome.

46:37.095 --> 46:39.974
â™ª â™ª

46:39.998 --> 46:40.908
I'm gonna go fix that

46:40.932 --> 46:43.510
before the national
guard gets called in.

46:43.534 --> 46:45.103
Yes. Of course.

46:48.239 --> 46:49.516
Okay, there we go.

46:49.540 --> 46:51.919
Alright, easy now.
Watch your step.

46:51.943 --> 46:53.254
Careful.

46:53.278 --> 46:54.288
It's slippery. Careful.

46:54.312 --> 46:55.289
- Careful.
- I'm fine.

46:55.313 --> 46:57.024
I'm not fine!

46:57.048 --> 46:58.059
Oh!

46:58.083 --> 47:00.385
Whoa!

47:02.353 --> 47:05.590
â™ª â™ª

47:11.562 --> 47:13.107
- Oh!
- Oh...

47:13.131 --> 47:14.465
Uh... Richard.

47:17.035 --> 47:18.369
"Mr. Right."

47:20.071 --> 47:23.384
Hi. Sorry to intrude.
The door was open.

47:23.408 --> 47:26.120
I just wanted to drop off
an anniversary gift.

47:26.144 --> 47:29.991
May your next 40 years be
as happy as the first 40.

47:30.015 --> 47:30.992
Thank you, Richard.

47:31.016 --> 47:32.059
You want to open it?

47:32.083 --> 47:34.385
I know how much you like
coffee and tea products...

47:36.354 --> 47:39.633
And this baby is straight
from Switzerland.

47:39.657 --> 47:42.336
The next generation in
espresso machines...

47:42.360 --> 47:43.600
Hasn't even hit the market yet.

47:43.624 --> 47:45.139
I had a client pull
a few strings.

47:45.163 --> 47:46.974
Oh, that's very generous.

47:46.998 --> 47:48.033
Very.

47:49.600 --> 47:51.112
Hi, granddad.

47:51.136 --> 47:53.247
Richard, this is my granddad.

47:53.271 --> 47:55.606
Hi! Nice to meet you... sir.

47:57.508 --> 47:58.868
He can hear. He
just doesn't speak.

47:58.892 --> 47:59.686
Oh.

47:59.710 --> 48:00.988
It's okay.

48:01.012 --> 48:03.690
And this is my sister, Mindy.

48:03.714 --> 48:05.492
Hi, Mindy. I've heard
so much about you.

48:05.516 --> 48:07.318
You too.

48:08.686 --> 48:10.055
Posture, Mindy.

48:11.456 --> 48:14.168
So I can see that you've all
got a lot going on here,

48:14.192 --> 48:16.270
so I will just head out
before your guests arrive.

48:16.294 --> 48:19.073
I won't hear of it. You'll
stay for the party.

48:19.097 --> 48:21.057
Oh, no, thank you, but I've
got a long drive back.

48:21.081 --> 48:22.043
Nonsense!

48:22.067 --> 48:23.210
We insist you stay.

48:23.234 --> 48:24.311
In fact, you'll spend the night.

48:24.335 --> 48:25.579
You can have the blue room,

48:25.603 --> 48:27.014
upstairs at the end of the hall.

48:27.038 --> 48:28.115
Thank you.

48:28.139 --> 48:30.151
You know, we used
to stock this line,

48:30.175 --> 48:32.353
but the... The frother
always broke.

48:32.377 --> 48:33.554
Not on this one.

48:33.578 --> 48:35.218
This is a Jura Impressa
from Switzerland.

48:35.242 --> 48:37.024
Top of the line.

48:37.048 --> 48:38.248
Why don't you let me show you?

48:38.272 --> 48:40.108
Let's go to the kitchen.

48:49.727 --> 48:52.173
This baby is the Lamborghini
of espressomakers...

48:52.197 --> 48:53.474
All the bells and whistles.

48:53.498 --> 48:55.342
Die-cast aluminum boiler,

48:55.366 --> 48:57.235
uh, overheating
protection device...

49:04.675 --> 49:06.453
20-bar high-pressure pump.

49:06.477 --> 49:08.555
I'm just going to plug
it in and fire it up,

49:08.579 --> 49:10.481
and I will show you how am...

49:16.421 --> 49:19.533
â™ª â™ª

49:19.557 --> 49:21.035
Oh! I don't believe it!

49:21.059 --> 49:23.537
That stupid fish
knocked the power out.

49:23.561 --> 49:25.430
What did I do to deserve this?

49:30.135 --> 49:32.403
â™ª â™ª

49:40.345 --> 49:42.589
Mom, where are the
extra candles?

49:42.613 --> 49:45.059
I don't know! I
can't see a thing.

49:45.083 --> 49:47.294
Joseph! Get a flashlight.

49:47.318 --> 49:48.595
Flashlight app.

49:48.619 --> 49:49.730
Thank you, Richard.

49:49.754 --> 49:51.434
Where's the panel? I'll
check the breakers.

49:51.458 --> 49:53.160
You've done quite enough.

49:55.460 --> 49:57.495
How do I get out of here?

50:07.838 --> 50:10.175
â™ª â™ª

50:16.614 --> 50:19.250
â™ª â™ª

50:20.168 --> 50:21.328
You know what, Mrs. Mayfield?

50:21.352 --> 50:22.792
I'll be happy to
check the breakers.

50:22.816 --> 50:23.693
They're downstairs.

50:23.717 --> 50:24.798
I'll help you.

50:24.822 --> 50:26.757
â™ª â™ª

50:31.596 --> 50:34.275
Do you know how hard it
is to get candle wax out?

50:34.299 --> 50:35.859
Next thing you know,
there'll be a fire!

50:35.883 --> 50:37.744
The electrician can't get
here until tomorrow.

50:37.768 --> 50:39.280
This is a disaster!

50:39.304 --> 50:42.149
The photographer's gonna
be here any minute!

50:42.173 --> 50:44.251
You know, I saw a generator
in the Wilsons' yard.

50:44.275 --> 50:46.220
We don't associate
with the Wilsons.

50:46.244 --> 50:47.154
Claire! Take a deep breath.

50:47.178 --> 50:48.858
Sit down, I'm sure
everything will be fine.

50:48.882 --> 50:50.757
I don't see how.

50:50.781 --> 50:52.826
â™ª â™ª

50:52.850 --> 50:53.927
Which door is it?

50:53.951 --> 50:55.796
Slow down. It's on the left.
Right here.

50:55.820 --> 50:57.364
- Okay.
- Okay, shine the light.

50:57.388 --> 50:58.823
It's over here.

51:00.525 --> 51:01.835
What are you doing here?

51:01.859 --> 51:03.537
Why were your arms around him?

51:03.561 --> 51:06.207
Oh, Richard. I lost my balance.

51:06.231 --> 51:07.541
This was a bad idea.

51:07.565 --> 51:08.742
No! He's doing us a favor.

51:08.766 --> 51:09.743
Oh, yeah?

51:09.767 --> 51:11.647
Well, it looks like he's
having too good a time.

51:11.671 --> 51:12.679
He's not.

51:12.703 --> 51:14.281
Besides, my parents
just invited you

51:14.305 --> 51:16.307
to spend the night.

51:18.476 --> 51:19.820
You're right. I'm sorry.

51:19.844 --> 51:21.188
I just... I saw you with him,

51:21.212 --> 51:22.589
and I got a little bit jealous.

51:22.613 --> 51:24.325
How crazy is that?

51:24.349 --> 51:26.127
Right?

51:26.151 --> 51:28.629
â™ª â™ª

51:28.653 --> 51:31.122
Uh...

51:40.798 --> 51:42.409
Come on.

51:42.433 --> 51:44.378
Do you know what
this reminds me of?

51:44.402 --> 51:46.213
Our first date.

51:46.237 --> 51:47.681
Oh, this is worse.

51:47.705 --> 51:50.817
Well, the electricity went
out in that restaurant.

51:50.841 --> 51:52.419
Don't remind me.

51:52.443 --> 51:53.620
I forgot my wallet.

51:53.644 --> 51:56.190
I know, I lost my contact lens.

51:56.214 --> 51:58.392
I couldn't even pay the bill.

51:58.416 --> 52:01.352
We couldn't pay a lot
of bills in those days.

52:09.194 --> 52:11.405
Alright, this should
do the trick.

52:11.429 --> 52:13.731
Oh, perfect! Thanks, guys.

52:15.566 --> 52:17.468
Hey, no problem.

52:20.571 --> 52:23.784
You know, it's nice
to see Mindy open up.

52:23.808 --> 52:25.719
Maybe we should get
you some green hair.

52:25.743 --> 52:26.953
Oh, no. No.

52:26.977 --> 52:28.679
I'll stick with the gray.

52:29.880 --> 52:31.625
Can I be honest with you?

52:31.649 --> 52:34.252
Well... If you have to.

52:35.420 --> 52:37.564
I kind of like being
in a relationship,

52:37.588 --> 52:40.334
even if it's pretend.

52:40.358 --> 52:42.303
Still pretend, huh?

52:42.327 --> 52:44.971
Does it matter?
She's with Richard.

52:44.995 --> 52:47.432
That guy's a stiff.

52:50.335 --> 52:53.714
I don't know, gramps. I might
be in over my head here.

52:53.738 --> 52:55.516
Let me tell you something.

52:55.540 --> 52:57.718
If you never commit to anything,

52:57.742 --> 52:59.420
you're gonna miss out

52:59.444 --> 53:01.312
on some of the best
things in life.

53:02.913 --> 53:04.425
You know you're a guy

53:04.449 --> 53:07.352
who hasn't spoken to his
family in two years?

53:09.920 --> 53:12.690
Alright. Fingers crossed.

53:18.596 --> 53:20.006
Oh!

53:20.030 --> 53:21.030
Just in time!

53:24.669 --> 53:26.680
Easy. Watch your step.

53:26.704 --> 53:28.515
We can't thank you enough.

53:28.539 --> 53:29.950
Well done, Richard.

53:29.974 --> 53:31.885
- Bravo!
- My pleasure.

53:31.909 --> 53:33.387
I don't know what
we would have done.

53:33.411 --> 53:35.646
You gonna let that
suit take credit?

53:37.014 --> 53:38.659
That's what I'm here for.

53:38.683 --> 53:40.851
Well, if you say so.

53:43.854 --> 53:45.532
Alright, let's get going.

53:45.556 --> 53:47.436
We have so much to do
before everyone gets here.

53:47.460 --> 53:49.336
Joseph, go check on the food.

53:49.360 --> 53:50.837
Richard, get... Get
those candles.

53:50.861 --> 53:52.806
Um... sure.

53:52.830 --> 53:55.642
Okay, dad, you need to get dressed.
Go on.

53:55.666 --> 53:56.710
You, too, Richard.

53:56.734 --> 54:00.004
How do we think today went, Rex?

54:01.372 --> 54:04.241
Yeah. That's what I thought.

54:06.911 --> 54:08.689
Oh.

54:08.713 --> 54:10.291
Thank goodness.

54:10.315 --> 54:11.715
Help me get this
noose off my neck.

54:11.739 --> 54:12.893
What are you doing?

54:12.917 --> 54:14.961
Well, your parents love Richard,

54:14.985 --> 54:16.497
they hate me... My
work here is done.

54:16.521 --> 54:17.631
You're not leaving.

54:17.655 --> 54:18.935
Well, you don't need me anymore.

54:18.959 --> 54:19.959
Yeah, I do!

54:20.725 --> 54:22.002
You do?

54:22.026 --> 54:23.770
Gridley...

54:23.794 --> 54:26.840
Just stay. It's a party, okay?

54:26.864 --> 54:28.224
Okay, so let me get
this straight.

54:28.248 --> 54:30.944
You want me to be
your plus-two now?

54:30.968 --> 54:33.547
Or am I your plus-one

54:33.571 --> 54:35.916
and Richard's your plus-two?

54:35.940 --> 54:37.875
Just stay.

54:40.110 --> 54:42.413
â™ª â™ª

54:44.081 --> 54:45.091
Josie!

54:45.115 --> 54:46.393
Where are you?

54:46.417 --> 54:47.937
- So you're gonna stay? Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

54:48.886 --> 54:50.855
But I'm stickin'
with "plus-one."

54:52.122 --> 54:53.800
I was here first.

54:53.824 --> 54:56.861
Thanks for fixing the lights.

54:58.028 --> 55:00.297
â™ª â™ª

55:01.799 --> 55:04.369
How do ya like that?

55:11.909 --> 55:12.986
It's not here.

55:13.010 --> 55:14.570
Well, it couldn't have
just disappeared.

55:14.594 --> 55:15.389
Well, that's it.

55:15.413 --> 55:17.053
- We've looked everywhere.
- What's wrong?

55:17.077 --> 55:18.825
Your mother's Faberge
egg is missing.

55:18.849 --> 55:20.527
We've combed the room!
It's gone.

55:20.551 --> 55:21.862
I hate to be the one to say it,

55:21.886 --> 55:23.964
but I think we all
know where it's gone.

55:23.988 --> 55:24.998
What do you mean?

55:25.022 --> 55:26.533
Where's Gridley?

55:26.557 --> 55:27.868
Oh, you're not blaming Gridley?

55:27.892 --> 55:29.536
What do you really
know about him, Josie?

55:29.560 --> 55:31.137
Stop it! I've known
Gridley my whole life.

55:31.161 --> 55:32.539
It's been a long time
since high school.

55:32.563 --> 55:33.440
Gridley is not a thief!

55:33.464 --> 55:35.075
He would never do
anything like that!

55:35.099 --> 55:36.943
He doesn't care about an egg.

55:36.967 --> 55:38.527
Do you know how much
that egg is worth?

55:38.551 --> 55:39.480
Mother, yes.

55:39.504 --> 55:40.647
We all know.

55:40.671 --> 55:41.948
It'll show up, Claire,

55:41.972 --> 55:43.612
and if it doesn't,
we'll get another one.

55:45.410 --> 55:47.378
It's the Chronicle.

55:49.647 --> 55:51.592
Did you take that egg
to make him look bad?

55:51.616 --> 55:53.694
No! He's done that
all on his own.

55:53.718 --> 55:55.318
- So you didn't take it?
- Of course not.

55:59.123 --> 56:00.767
Ready, Mrs. Mayfield?

56:00.791 --> 56:02.135
Welcome to our happy home.

56:02.159 --> 56:04.505
Smile!

56:04.529 --> 56:07.598
â™ª â™ª

56:21.111 --> 56:23.848
â™ª â™ª

56:37.762 --> 56:39.440
Hi, Richard.

56:39.464 --> 56:40.707
Gentlemen! Over here, please?

56:40.731 --> 56:42.667
Oh! Uh...

56:47.972 --> 56:50.083
And can I get your names
for the Chronicle?

56:50.107 --> 56:51.952
- I'm...
- Richard Wright, of Wright...

56:51.976 --> 56:53.186
Silver, and Gumm.

56:53.210 --> 56:54.521
This is my card.

56:54.545 --> 56:55.922
Uh, Gridley.

56:55.946 --> 56:58.592
Of, um... Well, just Gridley.

56:58.616 --> 56:59.793
Been there.

56:59.817 --> 57:00.927
Haven't we all?

57:00.951 --> 57:02.629
And who are you gentlemen
to the family?

57:02.653 --> 57:04.931
I'm Josie Mayfield's boyfriend.

57:04.955 --> 57:06.066
And I'm her...

57:06.090 --> 57:07.668
He's, uh... an acquaintance.

57:07.692 --> 57:09.803
But Josie and I did
go to prom together.

57:09.827 --> 57:10.971
Maplewood High.

57:10.995 --> 57:12.873
My alma mater.

57:12.897 --> 57:15.108
You're kidding?

57:15.132 --> 57:19.980
â™ª Bear down, Maplewood
fight, Leafs, fight! â™ª

57:20.004 --> 57:21.804
Roots in the community,
enduring friendship...

57:21.828 --> 57:24.985
The Chronicle loves this stuff!
Are you from here, too?

57:25.009 --> 57:26.520
Sadly, no.

57:26.544 --> 57:27.788
- But I'm...
- Miss Mayfield?

57:27.812 --> 57:29.055
I'd love to get a shot of you

57:29.079 --> 57:30.479
and your old
high-school boyfriend.

57:30.503 --> 57:32.125
Oh, no, we only went
out the one time,

57:32.149 --> 57:34.027
but it was memorable.

57:34.051 --> 57:35.261
That it was.

57:35.285 --> 57:36.965
Would you mind putting
your arm around her?

57:36.989 --> 57:38.264
I think I can do that.

57:38.288 --> 57:40.024
Perfect!

57:41.892 --> 57:43.704
Great. Thank you.

57:43.728 --> 57:45.038
- Honey... oh.
- Excuse me.

57:45.062 --> 57:46.773
What are you guys, best friends?

57:46.797 --> 57:48.909
Can you take that
around to the back?

57:48.933 --> 57:51.211
Thank you.

57:51.235 --> 57:53.237
Why aren't you socializing?

57:54.772 --> 57:56.683
Because he isn't coming.

57:56.707 --> 57:57.984
Who isn't coming?

57:58.008 --> 57:59.219
Wade.

57:59.243 --> 58:00.954
I invited him to the party.

58:00.978 --> 58:02.122
Well, what do you expect,

58:02.146 --> 58:03.724
with those horrible
parents of his?

58:03.748 --> 58:04.958
Well, I like him.

58:04.982 --> 58:08.061
And I thought he was
starting to like me, too.

58:08.085 --> 58:09.445
You'll find someone
else, come on.

58:09.469 --> 58:10.296
Mom...

58:10.320 --> 58:13.233
What if I don't want
to find someone else?

58:13.257 --> 58:14.535
Excuse me?

58:14.559 --> 58:16.594
How about a picture of you two?

58:17.695 --> 58:19.305
Of course.

58:19.329 --> 58:21.009
Could you shoot her
from the right, please?

58:21.033 --> 58:22.878
Do you have to control
everything that I do?

58:22.902 --> 58:23.810
Somebody has to.

58:23.834 --> 58:25.011
You're right.

58:25.035 --> 58:27.071
Me.

58:30.051 --> 58:31.171
Put your hair behind your...

58:31.195 --> 58:32.296
Look, mom! Mom...

58:34.278 --> 58:36.890
I like the green hair.
And I'm keeping it.

58:36.914 --> 58:39.292
Look, I know it doesn't fit
into the Mayfield image,

58:39.316 --> 58:40.916
but I don't fit into
the Mayfield image!

58:40.940 --> 58:41.995
Mindy... My whole life...

58:42.019 --> 58:43.897
I've been under Josie's shadow,

58:43.921 --> 58:45.899
trying to be who
you want me to be!

58:45.923 --> 58:47.834
I'm not Josie, but I
am worth something!

58:47.858 --> 58:50.895
And I dropped out of college!

58:51.962 --> 58:53.674
What?

58:53.698 --> 58:55.041
When did this happen?

58:55.065 --> 58:57.243
Two semesters ago.

58:57.267 --> 58:59.713
And where has my
tuition been going?

58:59.737 --> 59:02.082
It's in a bank account.
You can have it all back.

59:02.106 --> 59:03.774
I have a job...

59:05.075 --> 59:06.587
I'm singing.

59:06.611 --> 59:08.088
In a coffee house.

59:08.112 --> 59:09.723
You can't be serious.

59:09.747 --> 59:11.291
This is who I am!

59:11.315 --> 59:13.951
And who exactly might that be?

59:15.953 --> 59:17.021
Ahem.

59:38.208 --> 59:41.287
â™ª Won't... you come home â™ª

59:41.311 --> 59:43.247
â™ª Bill Bailey? â™ª

59:44.649 --> 59:47.918
â™ª Won't you come home? â™ª

59:49.186 --> 59:53.123
â™ª She moans all day long â™ª

59:54.358 --> 59:55.558
Look, this really isn't app...

59:55.582 --> 59:58.152
â™ª I'll do the cookin', honey â™ª

59:59.429 --> 01:00:02.676
â™ª I'll pay the rent â™ª

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:05.912
â™ª I know that I've... â™ª

01:00:05.936 --> 01:00:08.906
â™ª Done wrong â™ª

01:00:10.675 --> 01:00:14.087
â™ª Remember that rainy evenin' â™ª

01:00:14.111 --> 01:00:17.724
â™ª I kicked you out â™ª

01:00:17.748 --> 01:00:25.748
â™ª With nothin' but a
fine-tooth co-o-omb â™ª

01:00:26.023 --> 01:00:28.301
â™ª I know â™ª

01:00:28.325 --> 01:00:30.227
â™ª I'm to blame â™ª

01:00:31.862 --> 01:00:35.075
â™ª Ain't that a shame? â™ª

01:00:35.099 --> 01:00:41.948
â™ª Bill Bailey, won't you
please come home? â™ª

01:00:41.972 --> 01:00:43.116
Come on, everybody!

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:45.451
â™ª Won't you come
home, bill Bailey? â™ª

01:00:45.475 --> 01:00:48.021
â™ª Won't you come home? â™ª

01:00:48.045 --> 01:00:51.181
â™ª She moans the
whole night long â™ª

01:00:52.382 --> 01:00:55.395
â™ª I'll do the cookin', honey â™ª

01:00:55.419 --> 01:00:57.163
â™ª I'll pay the rent â™ª

01:00:57.187 --> 01:01:01.125
â™ª I know that I've done wrong â™ª

01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:05.939
â™ª Remember that rainy evening â™ª

01:01:05.963 --> 01:01:07.440
â™ª I kicked you out â™ª

01:01:07.464 --> 01:01:13.013
â™ª With nothing but a
fine-tooth comb â™ª

01:01:13.037 --> 01:01:15.248
â™ª I know I'm to blame â™ª

01:01:15.272 --> 01:01:17.417
â™ª Ain't that a shame? â™ª

01:01:17.441 --> 01:01:21.121
â™ª Oh, Bailey won't
you please come... â™ª

01:01:21.145 --> 01:01:23.356
â™ª Come on, Bailey, now â™ª

01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:26.927
â™ª Bill Bailey won't you
please come home? â™ª

01:01:26.951 --> 01:01:27.861
â™ª Oh, Bailey â™ª

01:01:27.885 --> 01:01:31.197
â™ª Bill Bailey, won't
you please come... â™ª

01:01:31.221 --> 01:01:33.166
â™ª Ba-doop boop-a-doop, de-doo â™ª

01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:37.094
â™ª O-o-oh... â™ª

01:01:46.336 --> 01:01:47.981
Yay!

01:01:48.005 --> 01:01:50.216
Yeah, it's Richard.

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:52.352
I need a favor.

01:01:52.376 --> 01:01:55.379
I need you to check
someone out for me.

01:02:02.019 --> 01:02:03.954
â™ª â™ª

01:02:18.302 --> 01:02:20.847
â™ª â™ª

01:02:20.871 --> 01:02:22.515
Enjoying yourself, granddad.

01:02:22.539 --> 01:02:24.785
I noticed people were
starting to sweat,

01:02:24.809 --> 01:02:26.386
so, finally, I walked into
the middle of the room,

01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:28.410
and I said, "listen... If
you can't take the heat",

01:02:28.434 --> 01:02:29.835
get out of the
kitchen business."

01:02:30.915 --> 01:02:32.475
Dad's telling jokes
and mom's laughing.

01:02:32.499 --> 01:02:33.526
Who are these people?

01:02:33.550 --> 01:02:34.870
Tell me they're
not going to turn

01:02:34.894 --> 01:02:37.030
back into our parents again.

01:02:37.054 --> 01:02:38.164
Hey, do you remember that?

01:02:38.188 --> 01:02:39.833
Of course, I remember that!

01:02:39.857 --> 01:02:41.301
Do you remember
what you were like

01:02:41.325 --> 01:02:42.969
when you started the business?

01:02:42.993 --> 01:02:44.938
You were so full of ideas!

01:02:44.962 --> 01:02:47.407
Mayfield's was your idea.

01:02:47.431 --> 01:02:49.910
Oh, no! I may have
contributed a bit.

01:02:49.934 --> 01:02:51.277
More than a bit!

01:02:51.301 --> 01:02:52.478
There would be no Mayfield's,

01:02:52.502 --> 01:02:54.514
if it was not for your kitchen.

01:02:54.538 --> 01:02:56.140
Thank you.

01:02:58.275 --> 01:03:00.344
It was sort of fun
back then, wasn't it?

01:03:01.478 --> 01:03:02.522
We were a team.

01:03:02.546 --> 01:03:04.548
We were.

01:03:07.852 --> 01:03:09.129
You know...

01:03:09.153 --> 01:03:11.031
Oh, this probably isn't
the right moment,

01:03:11.055 --> 01:03:13.566
but I have had a thought
about the business.

01:03:13.590 --> 01:03:15.936
Oh, no. I shouldn't say it.

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:18.128
Of course, you should say it.

01:03:19.229 --> 01:03:21.407
Well...

01:03:21.431 --> 01:03:23.143
I was thinking about
a line of dogware,

01:03:23.167 --> 01:03:25.278
for the kitchen...
You know, plates,

01:03:25.302 --> 01:03:27.280
bowls, et cetera.

01:03:27.304 --> 01:03:29.182
Do you remember
Prince's favorite bowl?

01:03:29.206 --> 01:03:31.617
Didn't he eat that bowl?

01:03:31.641 --> 01:03:33.619
Yes! Yes, he did.

01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:35.221
And...

01:03:35.245 --> 01:03:37.490
Gentlemen, let me introduce
you to my daughters...

01:03:37.514 --> 01:03:38.491
Josie and Mindy.

01:03:38.515 --> 01:03:39.893
- Hi.
- How are you?

01:03:39.917 --> 01:03:42.162
How do you do? And how's
business, Joseph?

01:03:42.186 --> 01:03:44.898
Oh, could be better,
right, Josie?

01:03:44.922 --> 01:03:47.033
Oh, it could be worse. We're
certainly not shrinking.

01:03:47.057 --> 01:03:49.069
The fact is, is that
we're not growing,

01:03:49.093 --> 01:03:52.873
and, actually, Claire just
had a very interesting idea.

01:03:52.897 --> 01:03:53.806
I think that Mayfield's

01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:56.877
is going to introduce
a line of dogware.

01:03:56.901 --> 01:03:58.078
A canine line!

01:03:58.102 --> 01:04:00.947
Oh, mom, I love it! It's great!

01:04:00.971 --> 01:04:03.016
And why don't we do a
line for cats as well?

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:04.574
Smiles, please?

01:04:07.511 --> 01:04:09.322
Great! I've got
everything I need,

01:04:09.346 --> 01:04:11.324
so you enjoy the rest
of your evening.

01:04:11.348 --> 01:04:13.894
No! We were just about
to cut the cake.

01:04:13.918 --> 01:04:15.395
I'll take care of it, Mrs. M.

01:04:15.419 --> 01:04:17.354
Twist my arm.

01:04:19.023 --> 01:04:22.026
â™ª â™ª

01:04:32.402 --> 01:04:34.414
To Mr. and Mrs. M...

01:04:34.438 --> 01:04:37.617
Still together, after
all these years.

01:04:37.641 --> 01:04:40.320
The tide may have taken
you here or there,

01:04:40.344 --> 01:04:42.022
but true love...

01:04:42.046 --> 01:04:43.489
Like driftwood,

01:04:43.513 --> 01:04:47.952
reinvents itself and
stands the test of time.

01:04:49.186 --> 01:04:50.964
â™ª â™ª

01:04:50.988 --> 01:04:53.323
To love.

01:04:55.692 --> 01:04:58.328
May it always find its way.

01:05:04.038 --> 01:05:05.078
Well, that is certainly...

01:05:05.102 --> 01:05:06.947
Fantastic!

01:05:06.971 --> 01:05:08.505
Yes. It is.

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:11.217
I love that!

01:05:11.241 --> 01:05:12.452
Did you make this?

01:05:12.476 --> 01:05:14.955
Uh, well, I...

01:05:14.979 --> 01:05:16.689
Uh, she did!

01:05:16.713 --> 01:05:19.059
It's not what she
normally makes,

01:05:19.083 --> 01:05:20.126
but this time,

01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:22.228
she decided to try something
a little different.

01:05:22.252 --> 01:05:24.064
It's incredible, Mrs. Mayfield.

01:05:24.088 --> 01:05:25.665
Thank you.

01:05:25.689 --> 01:05:29.259
I'd love to get some shots
of the family with the cake.

01:05:31.495 --> 01:05:33.397
Smiles, everyone.

01:05:35.332 --> 01:05:37.243
What's that shiny
thing over there?

01:05:37.267 --> 01:05:40.680
Oh! Uh, this is a, uh, Jura
Impressa coffee machine.

01:05:40.704 --> 01:05:42.582
This is imported
from Switzerland.

01:05:42.606 --> 01:05:44.250
Yeah, I'm getting a
reflection from that.

01:05:44.274 --> 01:05:46.286
Do you think we could,
uh, move it somewhere?

01:05:46.310 --> 01:05:47.720
Preferably out of the room.

01:05:47.744 --> 01:05:50.114
Oh. Not a problem.

01:05:55.285 --> 01:05:56.662
Could you grab that?

01:05:56.686 --> 01:05:59.256
Yeah.

01:06:02.759 --> 01:06:04.537
Smiles, everyone!

01:06:04.561 --> 01:06:06.363
Beautiful...

01:06:12.102 --> 01:06:14.138
What a cake.

01:06:15.272 --> 01:06:16.616
What's it made of?

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:18.551
That's my little secret.

01:06:18.575 --> 01:06:21.645
â™ª â™ª

01:07:03.187 --> 01:07:05.689
â™ª â™ª

01:07:09.259 --> 01:07:10.270
Cake?

01:07:10.294 --> 01:07:11.371
Oh, thank you.

01:07:11.395 --> 01:07:12.838
It's delicious, Mrs. Mayfield.

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:14.307
Thank you, dear.

01:07:14.331 --> 01:07:16.566
What is that taste?
It's so familiar.

01:07:18.202 --> 01:07:20.270
It really is good, isn't it?

01:07:21.371 --> 01:07:24.074
â™ª â™ª

01:07:45.329 --> 01:07:47.464
â™ª â™ª

01:07:48.665 --> 01:07:49.775
I need to know.

01:07:49.799 --> 01:07:51.701
What's in the cake?

01:07:52.902 --> 01:07:54.614
What's in the cake?

01:07:54.638 --> 01:07:56.573
It's incredible!

01:08:13.290 --> 01:08:15.201
Oh, my!

01:08:15.225 --> 01:08:16.669
I don't believe it.

01:08:16.693 --> 01:08:18.537
We made the front page.

01:08:18.562 --> 01:08:20.305
Congratulations, dear.

01:08:20.330 --> 01:08:21.541
Oh!

01:08:21.564 --> 01:08:24.344
When the Wilsons were in,
they only got page 9.

01:08:24.368 --> 01:08:27.412
Oh! Listen to this.

01:08:27.437 --> 01:08:28.514
"To my great relief,"

01:08:28.537 --> 01:08:29.915
the Mayfield house was not

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:32.318
yet another picture-perfect
postcard...

01:08:32.341 --> 01:08:34.587
Instead it was a
delightful combination

01:08:34.611 --> 01:08:36.456
of whimsy, warmth and fun.

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:39.192
Claire Mayfield has
created a true home,

01:08:39.216 --> 01:08:41.861
"and an anniversary cake
made of Twinkies..."

01:08:41.885 --> 01:08:44.197
Twinkies?

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:46.666
I knew that tasted familiar!

01:08:46.689 --> 01:08:48.634
Oh!

01:08:48.658 --> 01:08:50.636
Congratulations
on the Chronicle,

01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:52.705
after waiting all these years.

01:08:52.729 --> 01:08:54.631
Yes, and the cover too.

01:08:55.965 --> 01:09:00.345
I'm sorry. What page was
your little story on again?

01:09:00.370 --> 01:09:02.715
You know, we're so
proud of our Wade.

01:09:02.738 --> 01:09:05.551
It'll be so nice to have
another doctor in the family.

01:09:05.575 --> 01:09:08.587
Perhaps he'll specialize
in plastic surgery.

01:09:08.612 --> 01:09:11.624
And what are your
daughters doing nowadays?

01:09:11.648 --> 01:09:13.526
You know, I'm so glad you asked.

01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:15.528
Josie is still in wooden spoons,

01:09:15.551 --> 01:09:17.462
and Mindy...

01:09:17.487 --> 01:09:19.465
She sings in a coffeehouse.

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:21.834
Oh, dear.

01:09:21.858 --> 01:09:23.269
She's very good.

01:09:23.292 --> 01:09:26.305
In fact, we couldn't be prouder.

01:09:26.330 --> 01:09:28.298
Enjoy your day.

01:09:32.502 --> 01:09:34.837
Good grief, that
woman is a snob.

01:09:37.341 --> 01:09:39.719
You know what's funny?

01:09:39.743 --> 01:09:41.254
I wanted this party

01:09:41.278 --> 01:09:43.456
so I could get in the Chronicle.

01:09:43.479 --> 01:09:44.857
I guess I was so caught up

01:09:44.881 --> 01:09:45.890
in appearances

01:09:45.915 --> 01:09:47.327
because they're all I have.

01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:48.528
That's not true.

01:09:48.551 --> 01:09:50.296
It is.

01:09:50.319 --> 01:09:52.365
The girls are grown.

01:09:52.389 --> 01:09:54.767
You and I... We've drifted,

01:09:54.791 --> 01:09:57.603
like a piece of that wood.

01:09:57.627 --> 01:09:59.639
I mean, until last night,

01:09:59.663 --> 01:10:01.006
I'd forgotten what it was like

01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:03.843
to have you listen to me.

01:10:03.867 --> 01:10:05.811
I like being a team again.

01:10:05.835 --> 01:10:07.647
So do I.

01:10:07.671 --> 01:10:09.939
And suddenly...

01:10:11.975 --> 01:10:14.019
Our anniversary means
so much more to me

01:10:14.043 --> 01:10:15.945
than any newspaper.

01:10:17.347 --> 01:10:20.384
â™ª â™ª

01:10:25.021 --> 01:10:26.499
Here it is!

01:10:26.523 --> 01:10:27.700
So?

01:10:27.724 --> 01:10:29.435
Better than I even imagined.

01:10:29.459 --> 01:10:31.504
Oh, mom, I'm so excited for you.

01:10:31.528 --> 01:10:33.339
Thank you, dear.

01:10:33.363 --> 01:10:35.308
- Oh, my.
- Wow!

01:10:35.332 --> 01:10:37.310
- Where's granddad?
- Oh, he went for a walk.

01:10:37.334 --> 01:10:39.054
- All by himself?
- Oh, don't worry, Mrs. M.

01:10:39.078 --> 01:10:40.946
He's been around the
block a few times.

01:10:40.970 --> 01:10:42.348
Well, that's true.

01:10:42.372 --> 01:10:43.849
Nonfat latte, Mr. Mayfield?

01:10:43.873 --> 01:10:45.375
Thank you, Richard.

01:10:47.644 --> 01:10:49.245
Gridley?

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:53.526
I thought you might be able
to use this for your vehicle.

01:10:53.550 --> 01:10:55.328
Extra virgin olive oil?

01:10:55.352 --> 01:10:57.062
This is the good stuff!

01:10:57.086 --> 01:10:59.832
Of course! We are
Mayfields, after all.

01:10:59.856 --> 01:11:02.702
I can get an extra five miles
to the gallon with this.

01:11:02.726 --> 01:11:04.904
Thank you. I'll
put it by my bag.

01:11:04.928 --> 01:11:06.372
You're welcome.

01:11:06.396 --> 01:11:07.740
You know, I was, uh...

01:11:07.764 --> 01:11:10.576
I was thinking about
your driftwood.

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:13.379
Now, we normally go with
acacia on our salad bowls,

01:11:13.403 --> 01:11:15.348
but I wouldn't mind
mixing things up a bit.

01:11:15.372 --> 01:11:17.350
Now, I know you're not
exactly a corporate guy,

01:11:17.374 --> 01:11:19.685
although you did look
good in my suit.

01:11:19.709 --> 01:11:21.053
Can't argue with that!

01:11:21.077 --> 01:11:22.655
Why don't you pop by the office

01:11:22.679 --> 01:11:23.839
and we'll discuss some ideas?

01:11:23.863 --> 01:11:25.325
Your schedule permitting.

01:11:25.349 --> 01:11:26.659
My schedule? Um...

01:11:26.683 --> 01:11:28.352
Yep, I'm wide open
at the moment.

01:11:29.719 --> 01:11:32.698
Sorry to interrupt, but
that's not exactly true...

01:11:32.722 --> 01:11:34.967
Is it, Gridley?

01:11:34.991 --> 01:11:36.702
Something on your mind, dick?

01:11:36.726 --> 01:11:38.571
Actually, there is.

01:11:38.595 --> 01:11:40.275
Just wondering why
you're leaving next week

01:11:40.299 --> 01:11:41.341
on a one-way ticket?

01:11:41.365 --> 01:11:43.543
Puerto Rico this time, is it?

01:11:43.567 --> 01:11:44.777
What's going on?

01:11:44.801 --> 01:11:46.412
I made a few calls
and I'm glad I did.

01:11:46.436 --> 01:11:49.649
This guy moves every six months.

01:11:49.673 --> 01:11:51.417
Obviously, he's running
from something.

01:11:51.441 --> 01:11:53.653
Richard, why are you doing this?

01:11:53.677 --> 01:11:55.197
I'm just trying to
protect you, Josie.

01:11:55.221 --> 01:11:56.522
And your family.

01:11:56.546 --> 01:11:58.358
Okay, but just so you know,

01:11:58.382 --> 01:12:00.826
Gridley is going to Puerto Rico

01:12:00.850 --> 01:12:02.094
because it's a place
he's never been before,

01:12:02.118 --> 01:12:03.798
and a friend invited
him to crew on a boat.

01:12:03.822 --> 01:12:05.030
You knew?

01:12:05.054 --> 01:12:06.866
Of course I knew!

01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:08.490
I mean, it's just
Gridley being Gridley.

01:12:08.514 --> 01:12:09.602
No.

01:12:09.626 --> 01:12:12.538
Josie... um...

01:12:12.562 --> 01:12:15.941
Mr. Wright here is right.

01:12:15.965 --> 01:12:17.534
I haven't been
completely honest.

01:12:20.404 --> 01:12:21.814
Mr. and Mrs. M,

01:12:21.838 --> 01:12:24.417
I have some confessions to make.

01:12:24.441 --> 01:12:25.851
Um...

01:12:25.875 --> 01:12:27.920
Number one,

01:12:27.944 --> 01:12:32.392
I TP'd your house in 12th grade.

01:12:32.416 --> 01:12:34.684
It was a brilliant job, but
I feel bad nonetheless.

01:12:35.952 --> 01:12:37.162
Number two...

01:12:37.186 --> 01:12:39.956
I do move around a lot.

01:12:41.458 --> 01:12:43.403
I've never stayed
anywhere for very long

01:12:43.427 --> 01:12:46.706
because I never really
had a reason to.

01:12:46.730 --> 01:12:48.998
But I think I might
have a reason now.

01:12:50.166 --> 01:12:51.868
Here you are.

01:12:54.504 --> 01:12:56.440
And three...

01:12:57.807 --> 01:12:59.709
I still have feelings
for your daughter, sir.

01:13:04.648 --> 01:13:06.459
Josie, I...

01:13:06.483 --> 01:13:08.051
My egg!

01:13:11.955 --> 01:13:13.156
Oh...

01:13:15.124 --> 01:13:16.201
Oh, no.

01:13:16.225 --> 01:13:19.095
And I was just
starting to like you.

01:13:20.497 --> 01:13:22.742
I have no idea how
that got in there.

01:13:22.766 --> 01:13:25.077
This is... This is
just disappointing.

01:13:25.101 --> 01:13:27.813
Mrs. M, I didn't... I
didn't take your egg.

01:13:27.837 --> 01:13:29.482
I don't even like eggs.

01:13:29.506 --> 01:13:31.216
Well, I'm sure there's
an explanation.

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:32.885
Isn't there?

01:13:32.909 --> 01:13:35.411
Probably.

01:13:37.881 --> 01:13:39.649
I don't have one.

01:13:41.618 --> 01:13:43.698
Look, I am a lot of things
that you don't approve of,

01:13:43.722 --> 01:13:45.757
but I am not a thief.

01:13:59.068 --> 01:14:00.904
I think I should go.

01:14:10.113 --> 01:14:13.726
Aw, Rex. You're a good boy, hey?

01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:15.685
Go to Mrs. M.

01:14:17.621 --> 01:14:19.956
â™ª â™ª

01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:23.493
Oh, Rex.

01:14:30.767 --> 01:14:32.702
Gridley!

01:14:35.204 --> 01:14:37.040
I know you didn't take the egg.

01:14:38.307 --> 01:14:40.243
Thank you.

01:14:42.278 --> 01:14:46.291
Um... look, about
what I said in there,

01:14:46.315 --> 01:14:48.155
I shouldn't have put you
on the spot like that,

01:14:48.179 --> 01:14:51.016
but I meant every word.

01:14:53.189 --> 01:14:55.200
I don't know.

01:14:55.224 --> 01:14:58.037
I just... I don't know.

01:14:58.061 --> 01:15:00.840
Oh, hey. Hey, don't.

01:15:00.864 --> 01:15:03.075
Don't. It's okay.

01:15:03.099 --> 01:15:06.646
What did I expect? I mean,
this wasn't the plan.

01:15:06.670 --> 01:15:09.673
Everything worked out the
way it was supposed to.

01:15:11.741 --> 01:15:13.677
I just want you to be happy.

01:15:17.981 --> 01:15:20.684
â™ª â™ª

01:15:38.201 --> 01:15:40.345
Well, this brunch is excellent.

01:15:40.369 --> 01:15:42.271
Thank you, Richard.

01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:45.250
Mr. Mayfield,

01:15:45.274 --> 01:15:46.819
if you have a moment
before we leave,

01:15:46.843 --> 01:15:50.255
um, I'd love to talk with
you about my client.

01:15:50.279 --> 01:15:52.357
Well, how about right now?

01:15:52.381 --> 01:15:55.094
Great! Because this guy is
perfect for your foreign sales.

01:15:55.118 --> 01:15:57.262
He's an international
marketing genius

01:15:57.286 --> 01:15:58.764
and he speaks Mandarin.

01:15:58.788 --> 01:16:00.824
Mandarin?

01:16:02.502 --> 01:16:03.502
What is it?

01:16:03.526 --> 01:16:05.237
Well, I was just thinking
of Gridley's van

01:16:05.261 --> 01:16:07.006
running on Chinese food.

01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:08.140
Do you know how hungry I was,

01:16:08.164 --> 01:16:09.108
driving up in that thing?

01:16:09.132 --> 01:16:10.932
All I could think about
was beef and broccoli.

01:16:10.956 --> 01:16:13.245
I would kill for some
orange chicken right now.

01:16:13.269 --> 01:16:14.346
Kung pao shrimp!

01:16:14.370 --> 01:16:15.380
Moo goo gai pan!

01:16:15.404 --> 01:16:17.650
I just can't believe he
was gonna steal my egg.

01:16:17.674 --> 01:16:19.284
Mother, he wasn't gonna steal your egg.
We've been over this.

01:16:19.308 --> 01:16:20.986
- I know, but...
- Claire.

01:16:21.010 --> 01:16:22.187
Forget the egg.

01:16:22.211 --> 01:16:23.255
How can I?

01:16:23.279 --> 01:16:24.648
Because...

01:16:26.149 --> 01:16:27.884
Because it's a fake.

01:16:28.985 --> 01:16:30.295
What?

01:16:30.319 --> 01:16:32.665
I couldn't afford to buy
you a real one back then.

01:16:32.689 --> 01:16:34.299
I was just trying
to impress you,

01:16:34.323 --> 01:16:37.136
and I know you were disappointed
on our first anniversary.

01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:39.639
I wasn't disappointed.

01:16:39.663 --> 01:16:41.874
But it was only a rose.

01:16:41.898 --> 01:16:43.867
â™ª â™ª

01:17:00.083 --> 01:17:03.386
I've kept that
rose for 39 years.

01:17:04.688 --> 01:17:08.200
â™ª â™ª

01:17:08.224 --> 01:17:09.735
Alright. Ahem.

01:17:09.759 --> 01:17:11.160
Here we go.

01:17:13.229 --> 01:17:15.264
My signature Dulce
de Leche cake?

01:17:16.332 --> 01:17:17.867
From a bakery.

01:17:21.370 --> 01:17:23.048
Never made it. Not even once.

01:17:23.072 --> 01:17:25.150
I never liked that cake.

01:17:25.174 --> 01:17:26.409
Neither did I.

01:17:27.877 --> 01:17:30.322
Oh, Josie, I have
some news for you.

01:17:30.346 --> 01:17:33.049
I believe your mother's is gonna
be returning to the company.

01:17:34.483 --> 01:17:35.895
Oh, mom!

01:17:35.919 --> 01:17:38.163
Mom, that's... I
mean, it's perfect.

01:17:38.187 --> 01:17:39.699
It's perfect!

01:17:39.723 --> 01:17:40.800
You can have my office!

01:17:40.824 --> 01:17:42.744
You can redecorate, you
can do anything you want!

01:17:42.768 --> 01:17:44.570
I don't understand.

01:17:45.428 --> 01:17:48.207
I will always be
your little girl,

01:17:48.231 --> 01:17:49.809
but...

01:17:49.833 --> 01:17:51.400
You've laid my whole
life out for me.

01:17:52.902 --> 01:17:54.446
Daddy, I don't care
about tea caddies

01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:56.481
or mixing bowls... I don't cook!

01:17:56.505 --> 01:17:59.451
It's like I woke up one
day and I was in my 30s,

01:17:59.475 --> 01:18:02.746
and I can't even take a
walk without mapquesting.

01:18:05.114 --> 01:18:07.116
What are you saying, then?
Are you quitting?

01:18:09.018 --> 01:18:12.898
I just think I definitely need
some time to figure things out.

01:18:12.922 --> 01:18:14.991
Isn't this a bit sudden?

01:18:16.225 --> 01:18:17.961
Actually, I think it's
very long overdue.

01:18:21.464 --> 01:18:23.475
Well, maybe you're right.

01:18:23.499 --> 01:18:25.010
Maybe you're right.

01:18:25.034 --> 01:18:27.279
We trust your decisions.

01:18:27.303 --> 01:18:29.214
If you and Richard
want to be together,

01:18:29.238 --> 01:18:30.783
it's with our blessing.

01:18:30.807 --> 01:18:34.954
Oh! Honey... Isn't that great?

01:18:34.978 --> 01:18:37.489
And we trust your
decisions, too, Mindy.

01:18:37.513 --> 01:18:40.049
Even if they involve green hair.

01:18:41.317 --> 01:18:42.928
I don't know what to say.

01:18:42.952 --> 01:18:44.229
Me either.

01:18:44.253 --> 01:18:47.423
What if we say it's about time?

01:18:49.793 --> 01:18:51.336
Well, uh...

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:53.438
Wade's coming to hear
me sing next week.

01:18:53.462 --> 01:18:55.374
Maybe you guys could come, too?

01:18:55.398 --> 01:18:56.508
We'd love to.

01:18:56.532 --> 01:18:57.967
Wouldn't we, Joe?

01:18:59.202 --> 01:19:01.971
You haven't called
me "Joe" in ages!

01:19:03.873 --> 01:19:06.551
Hey! That's... That's my watch.

01:19:06.575 --> 01:19:07.552
Rex!

01:19:07.576 --> 01:19:10.179
â™ª â™ª

01:19:11.915 --> 01:19:13.292
Oh, Rex.

01:19:13.316 --> 01:19:15.427
What did you do?

01:19:15.451 --> 01:19:17.386
Oh, Rex!

01:19:22.125 --> 01:19:24.027
Well...

01:19:26.029 --> 01:19:27.840
There's your thief.

01:19:27.864 --> 01:19:29.942
So, Gridley was
telling the truth?

01:19:29.966 --> 01:19:32.435
Excuse me.

01:19:33.937 --> 01:19:36.339
â™ª â™ª

01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:41.420
You know, if this
client works out,

01:19:41.444 --> 01:19:43.022
I've got another one
in distribution.

01:19:43.046 --> 01:19:44.489
He's a genius.

01:19:44.513 --> 01:19:47.416
Why don't we just stick
with the one for now?

01:19:49.218 --> 01:19:51.220
Yeah.

01:19:56.860 --> 01:19:59.404
So... what now?

01:19:59.428 --> 01:20:01.606
What do you mean?

01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:03.909
Josie...

01:20:03.933 --> 01:20:06.278
You've been bringing guys
home like Richard for years,

01:20:06.302 --> 01:20:09.614
and just using dad's disapproval
as an excuse to say goodbye.

01:20:09.638 --> 01:20:11.875
That's not true.

01:20:13.309 --> 01:20:16.488
Okay. Well... It
just seems to me

01:20:16.512 --> 01:20:19.224
that if you ever really
liked any of them,

01:20:19.248 --> 01:20:21.517
you'd have fought for them.

01:20:24.187 --> 01:20:26.198
Okay. I'll, uh,
I'll talk to her,

01:20:26.222 --> 01:20:27.967
and I'll call you right back.

01:20:27.991 --> 01:20:30.069
Hi. Babe, I just
got off the phone

01:20:30.093 --> 01:20:31.136
with my guy at R&L.

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:32.304
I think I can get you a job,

01:20:32.328 --> 01:20:33.305
but I have to act fast.

01:20:33.329 --> 01:20:34.439
Richard...

01:20:34.463 --> 01:20:37.042
I can't.

01:20:37.066 --> 01:20:38.466
You don't... You
don't want the job?

01:20:38.490 --> 01:20:39.544
No. Okay.

01:20:39.568 --> 01:20:40.880
You and I don't make sense.

01:20:40.904 --> 01:20:42.614
Maybe we do on paper,

01:20:42.638 --> 01:20:44.283
I'm just...

01:20:44.307 --> 01:20:46.551
I'm so sorry.

01:20:46.575 --> 01:20:47.619
I don't...

01:20:47.643 --> 01:20:49.121
I don't understand.

01:20:49.145 --> 01:20:51.280
Well, that's the problem.

01:20:52.916 --> 01:20:55.418
Is this about your little
high-school sweetheart?

01:20:57.620 --> 01:20:59.364
You can't be serious
about Gridley!

01:20:59.388 --> 01:21:01.433
I mean, the guy is
a complete loser.

01:21:01.457 --> 01:21:03.235
No, he's not.

01:21:03.259 --> 01:21:06.205
And I let him walk
away once before...

01:21:06.229 --> 01:21:08.407
I can't do it again.

01:21:08.431 --> 01:21:09.465
Take my car.

01:21:11.567 --> 01:21:14.013
Jo...

01:21:14.037 --> 01:21:15.981
Josie!

01:21:16.005 --> 01:21:17.482
You're going after Gridley!

01:21:17.506 --> 01:21:19.418
Oh!

01:21:19.442 --> 01:21:21.020
You go, girl.

01:21:21.044 --> 01:21:22.487
What?

01:21:22.511 --> 01:21:24.180
I knew it!

01:21:25.348 --> 01:21:26.358
Dad!

01:21:26.382 --> 01:21:28.527
Huh?

01:21:28.551 --> 01:21:30.295
Oh!

01:21:30.319 --> 01:21:32.097
I-I...

01:21:32.121 --> 01:21:34.699
Guess I have some
explaining to do.

01:21:34.723 --> 01:21:36.568
You certainly do!

01:21:36.592 --> 01:21:39.104
How long have you
been able to speak?

01:21:39.128 --> 01:21:43.008
I don't care! Oh... dad.

01:21:43.032 --> 01:21:45.177
Oh!

01:21:45.201 --> 01:21:47.603
â™ª â™ª

01:22:23.772 --> 01:22:26.609
â™ª â™ª

01:22:38.187 --> 01:22:39.707
Bet you regret tearing
up that ticket.

01:22:41.357 --> 01:22:43.735
I didn't really think
it all the way through.

01:22:43.759 --> 01:22:45.304
This weekend didn't turn out

01:22:45.328 --> 01:22:47.272
like I thought it would.

01:22:47.296 --> 01:22:49.341
Nothing ever does.

01:22:49.365 --> 01:22:51.143
I have a confession
to make, too.

01:22:51.167 --> 01:22:52.711
What kind of confession?

01:22:52.735 --> 01:22:54.113
I don't want Mr. Right.

01:22:54.137 --> 01:22:56.239
- No?
- I want Mr. Wrong.

01:22:59.475 --> 01:23:02.145
Mr. Totally Wrong.

01:23:05.681 --> 01:23:10.986
