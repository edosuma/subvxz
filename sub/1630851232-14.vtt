WEBVTT

00:16.059 --> 00:19.280
<i>A passing is not an ending.</i>

00:19.323 --> 00:22.457
In the words
of the "Bhagavad Gita"...

00:22.500 --> 00:25.199
"The soul cannot be
cut down by any weapon

00:25.242 --> 00:27.853
"nor burnt by fire,
drenched by water,

00:27.897 --> 00:29.594
"nor withered by the wind.

00:29.638 --> 00:33.468
"We are not slain
when our bodies are slain.

00:33.511 --> 00:36.471
We have never not existed."

00:36.514 --> 00:39.343
- Some of you, many of you,
probably don't know about Vijay

00:39.387 --> 00:43.347
is that he was born
before the separation

00:43.391 --> 00:45.871
of Pakistan and India,
which led him

00:45.915 --> 00:49.658
to become an officer
in the military, a soldier...

00:52.313 --> 00:54.184
A soldier who became a healer.

00:54.228 --> 00:57.013
- The healer who became...
- So slow.

00:57.057 --> 01:00.973
And when I say slow, I mean the
man was practically glacial,

01:01.017 --> 01:04.629
but those methods extended
to his bedside manner.

01:04.673 --> 01:07.545
He would talk to his patients,
take his time,

01:07.589 --> 01:11.506
and not because he was slow
but because he...

01:11.549 --> 01:16.380
- Listened,
and he taught me that, uh...

01:16.424 --> 01:19.731
you can search and search
for the answers, but sometimes,

01:19.775 --> 01:23.300
sometimes all you need to do
is just be still

01:23.344 --> 01:26.477
and be ready
to receive the answers,

01:26.521 --> 01:27.913
to...

01:27.957 --> 01:30.742
to catch them out of the air.

01:30.786 --> 01:33.702
- Like that fly ball
that hit him right in the face.

01:33.745 --> 01:35.834
Vijay was the absolute

01:35.878 --> 01:39.708
worst softball player
in our league,

01:39.751 --> 01:42.537
but, man,
Vijay running bases...

01:42.580 --> 01:44.321
maybe it was
from playing cricket

01:44.365 --> 01:46.758
back in the day,
but the old dude...

01:46.802 --> 01:51.111
- Was the only doctor
to say "hello" to me

01:51.154 --> 01:53.069
on my first day
at New Amsterdam.

01:53.113 --> 01:56.159
I think that he knew
what it was like

01:56.203 --> 02:00.424
to be a new physician
in a new country.

02:00.468 --> 02:02.209
It was a simple gesture,
really,

02:02.252 --> 02:05.081
but it meant the world to me
to be seen, and I suspect...

02:05.125 --> 02:06.778
- Karen Brantley, you might
want to leave the room

02:06.822 --> 02:08.302
for this one, but...

02:08.345 --> 02:12.175
Vijay and I once snuck a
patient into another hospital--

02:12.219 --> 02:15.657
yeah--to get him the care
that he needed.

02:17.702 --> 02:19.530
And then we had
to sneak him back.

02:20.923 --> 02:23.230
- I didn't realize
that instead of ignoring me

02:23.273 --> 02:26.624
when I wanted answers...

02:26.668 --> 02:31.281
he was actually preparing me...

02:31.325 --> 02:35.242
leading me
to not need him at all.

02:37.722 --> 02:39.028
<i>I just, uh...</i>

02:42.727 --> 02:44.599
Oh, God.

02:44.642 --> 02:47.776
I, um...

02:47.819 --> 02:50.170
- Light and love to you.

02:50.213 --> 02:51.780
- You'll be forever
in our hearts.

02:51.823 --> 02:53.999
- I'm gonna miss your wisdom.
- Thank you for blessing us.

03:00.049 --> 03:01.485
Goodbye, Vijay.

03:33.300 --> 03:36.390
- You know, he's still here.

03:36.433 --> 03:39.958
- We all carry him
inside of us everywhere we go.

03:41.743 --> 03:45.225
You can still honor him
if you need to.

03:46.574 --> 03:49.446
- Got any prayers
you recommend?

03:49.490 --> 03:52.493
- I was thinking lunch.

03:52.536 --> 03:55.757
The Hindu mourning tradition's
a beautiful gesture.

03:55.800 --> 03:59.326
By feeding others,
we feed our own grieving souls.

03:59.369 --> 04:02.894
- There you go.

04:02.938 --> 04:04.592
Hey, what about
the other chaplains?

04:04.635 --> 04:07.072
- Oh, what other chaplains?
I'm all that's left.

04:07.116 --> 04:08.378
- What?
What do you mean?

04:08.422 --> 04:10.380
What about Reverend Salazar
or Rabbi Cohen?

04:10.424 --> 04:11.990
Reverend Salazar

04:12.034 --> 04:14.297
was so overworked
by the pandemic, she resigned.

04:14.341 --> 04:15.646
She did?

04:15.690 --> 04:19.389
- Rabbi Cohen passed away
while helping others.

04:19.433 --> 04:22.697
- Here you go.
- But I do what I can.

04:22.740 --> 04:24.916
What else can we do, right?

04:24.960 --> 04:27.092
- Ooh.
- You okay?

04:27.136 --> 04:28.398
Yeah, enough about that.

04:28.442 --> 04:29.617
Tell me about
jolly old England.

04:29.660 --> 04:32.010
England.

04:32.054 --> 04:34.883
England is, uh--it's great.

04:34.926 --> 04:37.102
It's everything
I hoped it would be, you know?

04:37.146 --> 04:39.757
And more, if I'm being honest.

04:39.801 --> 04:41.585
I feel kind of guilty
saying that,

04:41.629 --> 04:43.718
especially today,
especially here.

04:43.761 --> 04:47.287
- Never apologize for embracing
what life shows us, Max,

04:47.330 --> 04:49.419
especially joy.

04:49.463 --> 04:52.379
I think that Vijay
would approve.

04:52.422 --> 04:54.468
I hope so.

04:54.511 --> 04:56.774
I think I'm doing everything
Vijay would've wanted.

04:56.818 --> 04:59.777
You know, I'm slowing things
down a little bit,

04:59.821 --> 05:03.303
spending more time with Luna,
reading in the park,

05:03.346 --> 05:05.522
feeling the grass under our...

05:06.958 --> 05:08.699
Be right back.

05:11.441 --> 05:13.617
Hey, hey, you all right?

05:13.661 --> 05:15.402
Would you like a sandwich?

05:15.445 --> 05:16.794
- Thank you.
- Sure.

05:16.838 --> 05:18.970
- Help!
Someone help!

05:20.972 --> 05:23.148
Chaplain Alpert.

05:23.192 --> 05:25.934
- What happened?
- I don't know. He just fell.

05:28.676 --> 05:31.461
- Male, 30s, no ID.

05:31.505 --> 05:33.811
Blood pressure is 210 over 135.

05:33.855 --> 05:35.857
We pushed six milligrams
of Ativan and got nothing.

05:38.903 --> 05:41.341
- Okay, okay.
Uh, Walsh, Turan, trauma one.

05:41.384 --> 05:44.169
Turn him around.

05:44.213 --> 05:46.476
One, two, and...

05:50.480 --> 05:51.829
- Push two milligrams
of Ativan.

05:51.873 --> 05:53.962
- Were maxed out.
- Levetiracetam?

05:54.005 --> 05:57.618
- Loading dose in.
- Starting a continuous drip.

06:00.316 --> 06:02.536
- Okay, up his Phenytoin drip?
- Last time the paramedics

06:02.579 --> 06:03.885
did that,
his blood pressure crashed.

06:03.928 --> 06:05.626
- He won't survive
another hypotensive episode.

06:05.669 --> 06:07.584
- Okay, I'm running
out of options here, guys.

06:12.284 --> 06:14.286
- Load Phenobarb.
- Seriously?

06:14.330 --> 06:16.201
- You want to induce a coma?
- I don't see another option.

06:16.245 --> 06:17.507
On it.

06:21.511 --> 06:23.252
You know him?

06:23.295 --> 06:26.603
It's Rohan, Dr. Kapoor's son.

06:32.522 --> 06:32.914
.

06:32.957 --> 06:34.568
- Incoming!
Help.

06:34.611 --> 06:36.483
- Excuse me?
- I got a 58-year-old.

06:36.526 --> 06:37.832
Post collapse in the field.
He's stable for now.

06:37.875 --> 06:39.442
Okay, triage this way.

06:39.486 --> 06:41.662
- Oh, uh, is Dr. Bloom on?
I can---

06:41.705 --> 06:44.316
Triage this way.

06:44.360 --> 06:45.883
Okay.

06:50.671 --> 06:52.847
This is not triage.
This is a waiting room.

06:52.890 --> 06:54.370
- Brand-new.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.980
- I'm sorry.
This is Chaplain Alpert.

06:56.024 --> 06:57.939
He needs a full workup,
heart monitor, oxygen...

06:57.982 --> 06:59.331
- Okay, please use
our automatic kiosk,

06:59.375 --> 07:00.985
where you can enter
your insurance information,

07:01.029 --> 07:02.291
credit application,

07:02.334 --> 07:04.424
and an optional
patient satisfaction survey.

07:04.467 --> 07:06.426
Once we have
all your information,

07:06.469 --> 07:08.297
we'll call your number
based on a personalized

07:08.340 --> 07:10.430
seven-point evaluation.
Okay?

07:15.783 --> 07:17.262
- So where did they, uh--

07:17.306 --> 07:19.395
where did they move
the chemo lounge to?

07:19.439 --> 07:21.702
- They didn't.
It was eliminated.

07:21.745 --> 07:23.834
Eliminated?

07:23.878 --> 07:26.228
But the patients loved
that lounge.

07:26.271 --> 07:28.012
They used to play
cards in there,

07:28.056 --> 07:30.667
listen to music, laugh even.

07:30.711 --> 07:33.453
- Dr. Fuentes thought the room
took up prime floor space.

07:33.496 --> 07:36.368
- Prime floor space?
For what?

07:36.412 --> 07:39.546
- This--
top-of-the-line surgical suite.

07:39.589 --> 07:42.070
- This used to be
our hematological research lab.

07:42.113 --> 07:43.985
- And now
it's a surgical suite.

07:44.028 --> 07:46.074
- Okay, so where
did they put Dr. Shaffer?

07:46.117 --> 07:48.424
Dr. Shaffer got let go...

07:48.468 --> 07:51.122
since we stopped
all of our stem cell trials.

07:51.166 --> 07:53.647
- How did any of this
get past Dr. Wilder?

07:53.690 --> 07:54.952
Dr. Wilder?

07:54.996 --> 07:56.737
She's been signing
these changes away

07:56.780 --> 07:58.478
with a smile on her face.

08:00.175 --> 08:01.959
- I want to give you
the benefit of the doubt,

08:02.003 --> 08:03.352
and I want to be respectful,

08:03.395 --> 08:04.919
but I'm not going
to stand idly by

08:04.962 --> 08:08.009
while you gut the department
that I built and love and--

08:08.052 --> 08:11.752
And is still here, all of it,

08:11.795 --> 08:14.189
just hidden from view.

08:14.232 --> 08:16.365
What do you mean?

08:16.408 --> 08:19.194
Welcome to the resistance.

08:20.804 --> 08:22.458
Shut the door.

08:31.249 --> 08:33.774
- Mr. Ehrlich?
- Inside.

08:38.648 --> 08:39.997
Oh.

08:40.041 --> 08:42.347
Hi.

08:42.391 --> 08:44.480
- I used to have one of these
when I was a kid,

08:44.524 --> 08:47.962
but I remember it
being more fun.

08:48.005 --> 08:50.094
- You're, uh--
you're Jack Ehrlich?

08:50.138 --> 08:52.227
Yeah, your 11:00.

08:52.270 --> 08:54.795
- Where are your parents?
Did you--did you bring them?

08:54.838 --> 08:57.319
- They drove me, but I told
them to grab a coffee.

08:57.362 --> 08:58.973
They can be
a little oppressive.

08:59.016 --> 09:00.191
Oppressive?

09:00.235 --> 09:01.889
- I really need your help,
Doctor.

09:01.932 --> 09:04.326
Okay.

09:04.369 --> 09:07.024
Okay, what seems
to be the problem?

09:07.068 --> 09:10.332
- I want to be emancipated.
- Huh.

09:10.375 --> 09:11.986
- How old are you?
- Almost nine.

09:12.029 --> 09:13.161
Which is eight.

09:13.204 --> 09:14.771
- Okay, sure,
but hear me out.

09:14.815 --> 09:16.991
I'm a straight-A student,
spelling bee champ.

09:17.034 --> 09:20.168
I've been playing the piano
since I was two, so I'm ready.

09:24.694 --> 09:28.219
- Wouldn't living on your own
require an income?

09:28.263 --> 09:31.222
- No, because if you get
emancipated before you're 18,

09:31.266 --> 09:33.268
your parents
have to pay child support.

09:33.311 --> 09:36.532
- That's, uh...
- I Googled it.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.839
Right.

09:38.882 --> 09:41.189
So you would buy
your own clothes,

09:41.232 --> 09:42.756
your own food,
do your own laundry.

09:42.799 --> 09:44.584
- I'd live close enough
to my folks so they could help.

09:44.627 --> 09:46.629
My mom would still do
my laundry,

09:46.673 --> 09:48.544
and my dad
could still cook me dinner.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.939
I'm eight.
I'm not crazy.

09:51.982 --> 09:53.244
Hmm.

09:55.682 --> 09:58.815
- You know,
there's coffee inside?

09:58.859 --> 10:00.469
Uh, yeah.

10:00.512 --> 10:02.602
Yeah, I just wanted
to get some fresh air.

10:03.951 --> 10:06.475
You're trying to avoid me.

10:07.607 --> 10:08.912
Isn't that what you wanted?

10:08.956 --> 10:11.306
- Us aside,
what I don't want

10:11.349 --> 10:13.351
is for you to leave
this hospital because of me.

10:13.395 --> 10:15.876
This ED depends on you.

10:15.919 --> 10:19.793
If you leave, this department
and your patients will suffer.

10:21.272 --> 10:23.318
I've been through
breakups before.

10:23.361 --> 10:26.930
I can handle you being here,
us working together.

10:26.974 --> 10:28.715
I have issues with you,

10:28.758 --> 10:30.325
but the way you run an ED
isn't one of them.

10:30.368 --> 10:32.457
Why are you doing this?

10:32.501 --> 10:35.896
- Because I'm not gonna be
your reason for leaving.

10:35.939 --> 10:38.638
- You're not.
It's me.

10:40.248 --> 10:42.250
Stop.

10:42.293 --> 10:44.861
I'm not gonna
let you quit, okay?

10:44.905 --> 10:48.517
I'll reapply for my residency.
I will find another hospital.

10:48.560 --> 10:50.562
No.

10:50.606 --> 10:52.086
Then stay.

11:00.442 --> 11:02.618
- What about Spotify?
- No.

11:02.662 --> 11:06.143
- Pandora?
- Uh, let's get through this.

11:06.187 --> 11:08.145
All right, there,
the graft is holding.

11:08.189 --> 11:10.278
Let's close up Mr. Wilson.

11:10.321 --> 11:11.758
- This is Mr. Villa.

11:11.801 --> 11:13.673
Mr. Wilson was
three patients ago.

11:13.716 --> 11:16.458
- Sorry, everyone.
- Cut yourself some slack.

11:16.501 --> 11:18.329
Thanks to Veronica,
I'm starting to feel

11:18.373 --> 11:20.070
like I'm on the line
at a GM plant.

11:20.114 --> 11:22.725
- You know, I wouldn't mind
if we got to do anything else,

11:22.769 --> 11:27.643
you know, like remove a tumor,
stabilize a spine.

11:27.687 --> 11:30.602
- Who do we got next?
- Uh, Jason Forbes.

11:30.646 --> 11:32.779
63...

11:32.822 --> 11:36.130
- Don't say it.
- CABG surgery.

11:36.173 --> 11:38.262
Oh, come on.

11:38.306 --> 11:39.873
- Maybe you should talk
to Veronica?

11:39.916 --> 11:41.222
And say what?

11:41.265 --> 11:42.527
That these symptoms
could've been managed

11:42.571 --> 11:44.355
by low-cost medication,

11:44.399 --> 11:47.315
but, no, instead
they're referring them to us

11:47.358 --> 11:50.274
for needless
and expensive surgeries?

11:50.318 --> 11:51.972
That'd be a start.

11:55.062 --> 11:57.804
Forceps.

12:01.068 --> 12:02.939
- 58-year-old man,

12:02.983 --> 12:06.116
status post-cardiac arrest
and resuscitation in the field.

12:06.160 --> 12:08.118
Max?

12:08.162 --> 12:09.729
- Chaplain Alpert
needs our help.

12:09.772 --> 12:13.080
- Uh, Walsh, take the Chaplain
to curtains for a full eval.

12:13.123 --> 12:15.212
- What's with the jacket?
- What's with the waiting room?

12:15.256 --> 12:17.649
The very first thing you ever
said to me was get rid of it.

12:17.693 --> 12:19.086
Veronica.

12:19.129 --> 12:22.219
I was forced to reinstate it
when she slashed pay.

12:22.263 --> 12:25.396
Staff naturally left, and then
Veronica cut the number of beds

12:25.440 --> 12:27.137
to match the decreased
staffing levels.

12:27.181 --> 12:28.791
- Let me guess--time to care
went through the roof,

12:28.835 --> 12:30.358
so you had to put in
a waiting room.

12:30.401 --> 12:32.273
- Then, ironically, I had to
hire more people to staff it

12:32.316 --> 12:34.579
and, tragically,
not the people that I fired.

12:34.623 --> 12:36.494
So I ended up
spending more time

12:36.538 --> 12:38.845
- and more money on training--
- Why didn't you tell me?

12:38.888 --> 12:41.282
Max, why would I?

12:41.325 --> 12:44.024
You're not here.

12:47.549 --> 12:49.551
- The Chaplain has severe
carotid stenosis

12:49.594 --> 12:50.944
- with right-sided heart failure.
- Okay.

12:50.987 --> 12:53.033
- Let's get surgery down here.
- I already called them.

12:53.076 --> 12:55.078
- Hey, if you need anything--
- We're good.

12:55.122 --> 12:56.819
It's good to see, Max, really.

12:58.952 --> 13:00.649
- All right, what's the latest?
- Scans and labs

13:00.692 --> 13:04.131
showed no sign of a brain bleed
or multi-organ failure.

13:04.174 --> 13:05.393
Okay.

13:05.436 --> 13:06.829
- His BUN
and creatinine levels, however,

13:06.873 --> 13:08.570
are through the roof
with a bicarb of 18.

13:08.613 --> 13:11.529
- Okay, let's correct that.
- Bicarb, right away.

14:01.492 --> 14:01.884
.

14:01.928 --> 14:04.495
All right, so emancipation.

14:04.539 --> 14:05.932
Yes, and I'd prefer

14:05.975 --> 14:07.542
if you didn't try to talk me
out of it.

14:07.585 --> 14:10.675
- Oh, no, no, not trying to.
Not my job,

14:10.719 --> 14:13.461
just trying to understand.

14:13.504 --> 14:15.506
Come on, hit me back.

14:18.422 --> 14:21.904
So, uh, were your parents
abusive at all?

14:21.948 --> 14:24.080
- No.
- Okay.

14:24.124 --> 14:25.690
Do you feel unsafe
or threatened?

14:25.734 --> 14:27.214
Nope.

14:27.257 --> 14:29.869
- Any other member of your
family make you feel unsafe?

14:29.912 --> 14:32.175
- You're on the wrong track,
Dr. Frome.

14:34.003 --> 14:36.223
Thanks for that.

14:36.266 --> 14:40.488
Um, okay, pivot--
do you love your parents?

14:40.531 --> 14:41.837
Yep.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.230
- And they know
that you want to leave?

14:43.273 --> 14:44.579
- They do.
- How do they feel about that?

14:44.622 --> 14:47.016
- You're on the wrong track
again, Dr. Frome.

14:47.060 --> 14:49.323
- All right, okay,
I'm starting to get that.

14:49.366 --> 14:52.456
Maybe you can steer me
in the right direction?

14:52.500 --> 14:54.937
- I'm not here to talk
about my problems.

14:54.981 --> 14:57.766
I'm here because
on advice of counsel.

14:57.809 --> 15:00.551
- You have a lawyer?
- Two and they're total sharks.

15:00.595 --> 15:02.553
They're gonna file a motion
for emancipation

15:02.597 --> 15:05.165
in conjunction
with my child-support action.

15:05.208 --> 15:07.689
And they want a shrink
to support their claim.

15:07.732 --> 15:09.430
- I see.
- So, if I sense

15:09.473 --> 15:11.867
you're trying to steer me
away from my stated goal,

15:11.911 --> 15:14.696
I'll shut down
and run out the clock.

15:14.739 --> 15:17.090
- You'd do that?
- Try me.

15:24.532 --> 15:26.316
- The narrowing
of his carotid arteries

15:26.360 --> 15:28.318
is obstructing
the blood flow to his brain.

15:28.362 --> 15:30.494
- Endarterectomy?
- That's what he needs.

15:30.538 --> 15:32.627
- So when can we schedule it?
- I can't.

15:32.670 --> 15:35.499
- I don't do them anymore.
- What--since when?

15:35.543 --> 15:37.675
- Chaplain Alpert has been here--
- I know, for a long time.

15:37.719 --> 15:39.416
And he's helped us through some
of our darkest days.

15:39.460 --> 15:41.157
- He has, and now
it's our turn to help him.

15:41.201 --> 15:43.116
- I want to,
but it's out of my hands.

15:43.159 --> 15:45.466
- Out of your ha--
Floyd, you head the department.

15:45.509 --> 15:47.424
- Are you seriously telling me--
- I'm telling you this.

15:47.468 --> 15:49.687
I'm doing the best I can under
the impossible circumstances

15:49.731 --> 15:52.212
to keep even the most basic
procedures in this hospital--

15:52.255 --> 15:53.996
- If we don't act now,
he's gonna die.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.302
- Well, then send him
to Baptist.

15:55.345 --> 15:56.738
Baptist?

15:56.781 --> 15:58.174
- Baptist--they'll do it,
and they'll do a good job.

15:58.218 --> 15:59.784
- Baptist is
a private hospital.

15:59.828 --> 16:01.525
A surgery like this is gonna
cost 100 grand--you know that.

16:01.569 --> 16:03.440
Even with insurance, he will
never be able to afford it.

16:03.484 --> 16:05.529
And if we can't take care of
our own, then who the hell can?

16:05.573 --> 16:08.010
- There is no
"we" anymore, Max.

16:09.272 --> 16:11.144
That's how it works
around here now...

16:13.842 --> 16:15.887
If it even works at all.

16:18.107 --> 16:21.328
You're better than this.

16:21.371 --> 16:22.677
Am I?

16:35.603 --> 16:37.126
- What the hell happened?
- BP spiked.

16:37.170 --> 16:39.389
He's going into SVT,
Pushing beta blockers now.

16:39.433 --> 16:40.695
No, wait.

16:40.738 --> 16:42.044
- He can't wait.
He'll go into heart failure--

16:42.088 --> 16:43.741
- Push six milligrams
of adenosine instead.

16:43.785 --> 16:45.743
- Why?
- Just do it.

16:45.787 --> 16:47.049
Copy.

17:05.502 --> 17:08.679
- I got your tox screen.
- Thanks.

17:08.723 --> 17:11.508
There's a significant increase
of amphetamines.

17:11.552 --> 17:13.858
Apparent overdose.

17:13.902 --> 17:17.166
If we had pushed beta blockers,
we would've killed him.

17:18.733 --> 17:20.648
Good call, Dr. Bloom.

17:22.998 --> 17:25.174
Yeah, good call.

17:27.524 --> 17:29.961
- So you're basically running
a shadow hospital?

17:30.005 --> 17:32.268
Bingo.

17:32.312 --> 17:34.792
What about our research lab?

17:34.836 --> 17:38.405
- Oh, it's not gone.
It's just, uh, moved offsite.

17:38.448 --> 17:40.146
Secretly folded
into another lab

17:40.189 --> 17:41.625
that we outsource
our biopsies to.

17:41.669 --> 17:44.367
- Look at you,
you little rebel rouser.

17:44.411 --> 17:47.109
I didn't know
you'd be so clandestine.

17:47.153 --> 17:48.719
Hey, we're just continuing

17:48.763 --> 17:52.288
the tradition
that you and Max started.

17:52.332 --> 17:54.160
How can I help?

17:54.203 --> 17:56.466
- Chaplain Alpert
needs an endarterectomy

17:56.510 --> 17:58.251
to save his life,
but guess what--

17:58.294 --> 17:59.861
- we don't do those anymore.
- You got my text.

17:59.904 --> 18:01.689
- You know, he's given
everything to this hospital,

18:01.732 --> 18:03.299
and we can't give it
back to him?

18:03.343 --> 18:04.866
We can't give him the dignity,
the--the...

18:04.909 --> 18:06.607
Why are we in the morgue?

18:06.650 --> 18:08.913
- Because we're gonna save
the Chaplain's life.

18:08.957 --> 18:10.263
We are?

18:10.306 --> 18:12.134
Welcome to the resistance.

18:20.360 --> 18:24.364
- Oh, there's my
holistic-wellness chieftess.

18:24.407 --> 18:27.671
- Please, have a seat.
- Thank you.

18:27.715 --> 18:29.151
You saw my request.

18:29.195 --> 18:31.458
How could I miss it,

18:31.501 --> 18:34.504
being as large
and inflated as it is?

18:34.548 --> 18:36.332
- I prefer to think of it
as aspirational.

18:36.376 --> 18:38.508
Well, wanting an entire floor

18:38.552 --> 18:41.076
of the hospital
certainly qualifies.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.078
What's wrong
with your current situation?

18:43.122 --> 18:47.561
- "Low ceilings and tiny rooms
cramp the soul and the mind."

18:47.604 --> 18:49.519
Dostoevsky.

18:49.563 --> 18:52.522
- Yes, wow.
Um, oh, my gosh.

18:52.566 --> 18:55.134
People usually just think
I'm quoting Deepak Chopra.

18:55.177 --> 18:56.439
Not me.

18:56.483 --> 18:59.138
That's why I hired you.

18:59.181 --> 19:02.184
So you want more space
for acupuncture

19:02.228 --> 19:04.447
and for meditation.

19:05.883 --> 19:08.364
That's a pretty big ask,

19:08.408 --> 19:10.975
but I think
I can make that happen.

19:11.019 --> 19:12.673
Really?

19:12.716 --> 19:15.241
- Why ask
if you didn't think I could?

19:15.284 --> 19:19.506
- I--no, I'm--
Wow, wow, that's--that's great.

19:19.549 --> 19:22.900
This is, um--thank you.
This is a dream manifesting.

19:22.944 --> 19:25.381
- Good, good.

19:25.425 --> 19:28.776
- Now, while that's
gonna help your department,

19:28.819 --> 19:30.778
I'm gonna ask
a little something of you

19:30.821 --> 19:32.562
that's gonna help
the whole hospital.

19:32.606 --> 19:34.390
- Yeah.
No, anything I can do

19:34.434 --> 19:37.915
to help push that
rock up the mountain.

19:37.959 --> 19:40.831
- So what do you know
about the so-called resistance?

19:46.097 --> 19:49.318
- Yeah, it's funny that
you should ask about that.

19:54.105 --> 19:54.236
.

19:54.280 --> 19:56.847
- You got the faster car, man.
This isn't fair.

19:56.891 --> 19:58.719
Come on, come on.

19:58.762 --> 20:01.287
- Come on. No!
- Yes!

20:01.330 --> 20:02.897
Die, purple loser!

20:02.940 --> 20:05.726
That was very unkind.

20:05.769 --> 20:09.904
- But it was fun.
- Yeah, yeah, it was fun.

20:09.947 --> 20:11.775
Do your, uh--do your parents
let you play video games?

20:11.819 --> 20:13.603
Yeah, they're not monsters,

20:13.647 --> 20:15.779
but they think
I'm wasting my time.

20:15.823 --> 20:17.738
- What would they rather
you be doing?

20:17.781 --> 20:19.783
- I don't know.
Accomplish things, I guess.

20:19.827 --> 20:21.524
- You are accomplished.
- Not enough.

20:21.568 --> 20:23.483
They're always
worried about my future.

20:23.526 --> 20:24.745
It's not like we're rich,
you know?

20:24.788 --> 20:26.573
They want me to skip grades,

20:26.616 --> 20:28.923
be in the same class
as 12-year-olds.

20:28.966 --> 20:31.665
- 12-year-olds are weird.
- That's got to suck--

20:31.708 --> 20:32.927
feeling like
you're giving it your all,

20:32.970 --> 20:34.624
but you're still not enough.

20:34.668 --> 20:37.279
- Which is why I figure
it's better just to get out--

20:37.323 --> 20:41.327
better for me
and better for my parents.

20:41.370 --> 20:44.068
- Oh, you have a lot of games.
- Yeah, I do.

20:44.112 --> 20:47.594
In fact, how would you feel
about coming back next week

20:47.637 --> 20:50.292
and giving me
another butt kicking?

20:50.336 --> 20:52.294
- I see what you're doing,
Dr. Frome.

20:52.338 --> 20:53.687
We're just talking.

20:53.730 --> 20:56.298
- You're building
a therapeutic alliance,

20:56.342 --> 20:59.301
hoping to lean me away from
my desire to be emancipated.

20:59.345 --> 21:01.347
- Well, that is
very astute, Jack,

21:01.390 --> 21:03.174
but you are dead wrong,
all right?

21:03.218 --> 21:05.742
If we meet, I won't be leading
you anywhere.

21:05.786 --> 21:06.787
Whatever we do in here,

21:06.830 --> 21:08.267
whatever you want to play,
we play.

21:08.310 --> 21:10.312
Whatever you want to
talk about, we'll talk about.

21:10.356 --> 21:12.009
It's your time, not mine.

21:12.053 --> 21:13.881
But what if nothing changes?

21:13.924 --> 21:16.623
There's no epiphany,
no breakthrough?

21:16.666 --> 21:19.713
- Yeah, sometimes there isn't.
- Then it's just wasted time.

21:19.756 --> 21:21.758
- Who feels the need
to accomplish now,

21:21.802 --> 21:23.717
you or your parents?

21:27.677 --> 21:29.418
One hour a week?

21:29.462 --> 21:32.726
One hour a week, just...

21:32.769 --> 21:35.642
wasting time.

21:35.685 --> 21:38.166
- That's gonna be
very challenging.

21:38.209 --> 21:39.341
I know, right?

21:52.789 --> 21:54.878
- Hey.
- Hi.

21:56.402 --> 21:58.752
How's Rohan doing?

21:58.795 --> 22:00.841
Better.

22:00.884 --> 22:03.017
Yeah, he's gonna make
a full recovery.

22:03.060 --> 22:04.758
It's just a matter of time.

22:06.934 --> 22:09.153
And how's Lauren?

22:11.634 --> 22:13.157
The truth?

22:15.290 --> 22:16.726
Preferably.

22:30.697 --> 22:32.699
What are these?

22:32.742 --> 22:34.788
They are black beauties.

22:36.572 --> 22:38.095
Amphetamines.

22:39.488 --> 22:41.360
It's Rohan's.

22:42.709 --> 22:44.885
- I didn't.
- Okay.

22:44.928 --> 22:46.800
Okay, all right.

22:51.282 --> 22:53.589
This whole place

22:53.633 --> 22:56.549
is like a trigger for me,
you know?

22:56.592 --> 23:00.161
And not even my sobriety.
It's like my sanity.

23:02.468 --> 23:04.948
I want to leave.

23:04.992 --> 23:07.342
I mean, I need to leave.

23:08.865 --> 23:10.650
But Leyla...

23:12.129 --> 23:14.610
Leyla said that she would

23:14.654 --> 23:17.874
basically quit if I left...

23:17.918 --> 23:20.442
that the ED needs me,

23:20.486 --> 23:23.967
New Amsterdam needs me.

23:24.011 --> 23:26.448
- Well, that--that doesn't seem
very fair.

23:28.232 --> 23:29.582
Fair.

23:32.541 --> 23:34.717
Who says I deserve fair?

23:40.506 --> 23:45.162
- Lauren, whatever you've done,
you've got to let that go.

23:45.206 --> 23:47.600
You have to forgive yourself.

23:49.602 --> 23:50.864
I can't.

23:53.475 --> 23:55.782
I don't want to.

23:55.825 --> 23:59.525
- So you just want to keep
punishing yourself, do you?

24:01.222 --> 24:03.050
- Because that's what
I deserve.

24:11.972 --> 24:14.583
Lauren...

24:14.627 --> 24:15.758
look at me.

24:22.852 --> 24:25.638
Come here, sweetheart.
Come here.

24:28.902 --> 24:31.513
Now, you listen to me.

24:31.557 --> 24:36.518
If you need to leave
for your sobriety

24:36.562 --> 24:38.694
and for your sanity,

24:38.738 --> 24:41.480
then you go.

24:41.523 --> 24:42.916
Do you understand?

24:45.875 --> 24:48.791
Because nothing
is more important.

24:57.017 --> 25:00.237
- Clamp.
- Hemostat.

25:00.281 --> 25:02.065
What am I doing here?

25:02.109 --> 25:04.372
- A CABG procedure
on Ellen Greenfield?

25:04.415 --> 25:06.766
I'll make sure
not to tell her you asked.

25:06.809 --> 25:08.202
Meanwhile, Chaplain Alpert

25:08.245 --> 25:10.857
needs a surgery
that I can do in my sleep.

25:10.900 --> 25:13.163
- You did what you could.
- Did I?

25:13.207 --> 25:15.426
For every CABG we do,
there are ten patients

25:15.470 --> 25:19.387
like Chaplain Alpert that get
either transferred or ignored.

25:19.430 --> 25:22.825
That's the definition
of a bad system.

25:22.869 --> 25:25.828
- It needs to stop.
- So stop it.

25:25.872 --> 25:27.613
You're the chair
of surgery, right?

25:27.656 --> 25:31.051
- You don't think I've tried?
Sponge.

25:31.094 --> 25:34.576
World-class facility,
resources,

25:34.620 --> 25:37.492
experience, and for what?

25:37.536 --> 25:40.495
So people can do
jerry-rigged procedures

25:40.539 --> 25:43.324
in whatever empty room
they can find?

25:44.630 --> 25:47.981
- That's not really happening,
is it?

25:52.333 --> 25:55.728
- Forget I said anything.
I'm sorry, I got riled up.

25:55.771 --> 25:59.079
- Floyd,
patients could get hurt.

25:59.122 --> 26:00.733
Patients could die.

26:03.126 --> 26:04.737
Unless we help them.

26:22.493 --> 26:25.453
- Kind of feels like
you've done this before.

26:25.496 --> 26:29.544
- We have, but never
a procedure this risky.

26:32.678 --> 26:34.636
Uh, everyone,
look at me, please.

26:34.680 --> 26:37.465
I need you all
to consent to the following.

26:37.508 --> 26:39.206
You're all here
of your own free will.

26:39.249 --> 26:42.688
You are aware of the medical
risks of this procedure.

26:42.731 --> 26:46.692
And you know by performing
surgery in this place

26:46.735 --> 26:48.171
under these circumstances,

26:48.215 --> 26:51.044
we are all
putting our jobs on the line.

26:53.133 --> 26:55.570
But every one of us here

26:55.614 --> 26:59.792
feels a duty
to save this man's life.

27:08.670 --> 27:10.803
Let's get him intubated.

27:16.243 --> 27:20.334
- It's okay. It's Reynolds.

27:20.377 --> 27:22.118
- How do you know for sure?
- I know him.

27:22.162 --> 27:23.163
He's here to help.

27:27.210 --> 27:29.691
Thought you were gone.

27:35.305 --> 27:38.047
When I heard the resistance
was in the morgue,

27:38.091 --> 27:39.614
I thought, "Isn't that poetic?"

27:39.658 --> 27:42.573
And I just had to come
and see it for myself.

27:46.273 --> 27:47.753
And here you are.

27:47.796 --> 27:51.800
How does that saying go?
Uh, <i>"Liberte. Egalite..."</i>

27:51.844 --> 27:53.976
What's the other one?

27:56.631 --> 27:57.588
Busted?

28:00.722 --> 28:00.896
.

28:04.204 --> 28:05.988
Welcome back, Chaplain.

28:06.032 --> 28:07.076
How you feeling?

28:09.383 --> 28:11.341
I'm feeling...

28:11.385 --> 28:14.997
like I just had surgery.

28:15.041 --> 28:17.826
- It's 'cause you did.

28:17.870 --> 28:20.611
A very successful one.

28:21.874 --> 28:23.527
- I'll give you both
some privacy.

28:23.571 --> 28:25.138
Thank you, Dr. Morgan.

28:27.531 --> 28:29.490
Ah, nearly 30 years,

28:29.533 --> 28:32.014
you'd think I'd know
every doctor in New Amsterdam.

28:32.058 --> 28:33.712
- Well, you do.
This isn't New Amsterdam.

28:33.755 --> 28:35.278
This is Baptist.

28:36.802 --> 28:38.412
You mean...?

28:38.455 --> 28:41.371
You needed help that, uh...

28:41.415 --> 28:43.373
we weren't able to give you.

28:43.417 --> 28:46.637
I thought
I could make it happen,

28:46.681 --> 28:48.857
but, um...

28:48.901 --> 28:51.642
my hope
for New Amsterdam was...

28:53.166 --> 28:56.647
You needed the best care
possible, and I got in the way.

28:56.691 --> 28:58.867
Sorry.

28:58.911 --> 29:01.565
- Come on,
it'd be sorry if I had died.

29:03.089 --> 29:04.699
- Then again,
maybe I have, huh?

29:04.743 --> 29:07.136
This view...

29:08.311 --> 29:11.184
And this bill...

29:12.446 --> 29:13.664
No bill.

29:16.798 --> 29:18.234
Excuse me?

29:18.278 --> 29:19.627
- Baptist--

29:19.670 --> 29:21.585
they started a fund
for medical professionals--

29:21.629 --> 29:22.761
anyone who works in health care

29:22.804 --> 29:24.414
that can't get
the care they need

29:24.458 --> 29:28.767
at their own hospital, which
is systemic, unfortunately.

29:28.810 --> 29:31.813
But this hospital--
they stepped up.

29:36.644 --> 29:38.211
Max, thank you.

29:39.516 --> 29:42.824
Now go live your life.

29:45.392 --> 29:48.134
Embrace the blessings
when they come.

29:53.748 --> 29:55.706
Time to go home, Max.

30:10.156 --> 30:12.071
Hey.

30:12.114 --> 30:13.724
How you feeling?

30:17.119 --> 30:19.208
Ashamed.

30:19.252 --> 30:21.167
- Mm-hmm.

30:21.210 --> 30:23.822
You know, part of me thinks
you should feel that way.

30:27.260 --> 30:29.828
This was a day
about your father.

30:29.871 --> 30:31.830
You made it about you.

30:34.484 --> 30:35.877
Was that your intention?

30:41.840 --> 30:43.798
No.
Okay.

30:47.497 --> 30:49.804
Then I, uh, have to ask you
a hard question.

30:54.591 --> 30:56.289
Were you trying
to end your life?

30:58.378 --> 31:01.120
Does it matter?

31:01.163 --> 31:04.253
- It does.
- Why?

31:06.212 --> 31:09.911
- Nothing about me
was good enough for him.

31:09.955 --> 31:12.653
And...

31:12.696 --> 31:14.263
he was right.

31:16.178 --> 31:17.919
I was desperate for his love,

31:17.963 --> 31:20.356
and all I could do
was disappoint.

31:23.707 --> 31:26.972
He loved you very much.

31:27.015 --> 31:30.540
No, he did.
He loved you.

31:30.584 --> 31:32.934
It was just his...

31:35.589 --> 31:37.591
It was his expectations

31:37.634 --> 31:40.942
that prevented him
from showing it.

31:40.986 --> 31:43.118
Showing it the way
that you needed him to.

31:55.696 --> 31:57.306
I miss him.

31:59.308 --> 32:00.570
I know.

32:06.794 --> 32:08.317
I know you do.

32:13.148 --> 32:15.324
But I really do believe...

32:17.631 --> 32:20.068
That if he had lived
a little bit longer...

32:22.201 --> 32:26.031
You two would've found
your way back to each other.

32:26.074 --> 32:27.989
I believe that, Rohan.

32:29.643 --> 32:31.036
Well...

32:33.299 --> 32:36.389
We'll never know,
now, will we?

32:39.174 --> 32:41.568
I think that's up to you.

32:43.483 --> 32:44.614
How?

32:49.141 --> 32:52.231
Everything your father was,

32:52.274 --> 32:56.409
everything that he could be...

32:56.452 --> 32:58.237
that's in you.

33:00.021 --> 33:02.067
No, it is.
It's inside of you.

33:02.110 --> 33:04.112
His life is in yours.

33:06.245 --> 33:07.898
How are you gonna live it?

33:34.447 --> 33:36.362
Sorry I'm late.

33:42.063 --> 33:45.762
The "resistance."

33:45.806 --> 33:48.504
The <i>resistance.</i>

33:50.289 --> 33:54.206
Ignoring mandates,
conducting illicit surgeries,

33:54.249 --> 33:56.686
risking the accreditation
of this hospital--

33:56.730 --> 33:58.123
It was me!

34:00.212 --> 34:02.649
- I authorized
the Chaplain's surgery,

34:02.692 --> 34:04.129
and I was going to lead it,

34:04.172 --> 34:08.089
so you do not need
to punish anyone else here.

34:12.006 --> 34:14.182
Please accept my resignation.

34:14.226 --> 34:17.359
- No, Dr. Wilder, I do not
accept your resignation,

34:17.403 --> 34:21.102
because, unfortunately,
your surgeries generate

34:21.146 --> 34:25.541
a staggering amount
of revenue for this hospital.

34:25.585 --> 34:28.066
- Yeah, but I will not stay
here under these conditions.

34:28.109 --> 34:30.198
- Well, actually,
I think you might.

34:30.242 --> 34:32.070
Otherwise,
I'll have to report you

34:32.113 --> 34:33.636
to the AMA for what you did,

34:33.680 --> 34:35.377
and then they'll strip you
of your license,

34:35.421 --> 34:37.205
and it will get
very, very messy indeed.

34:37.249 --> 34:38.685
No, no, that's enough.

34:38.728 --> 34:41.209
Hey, you are entitled
to call us out, that's fine,

34:41.253 --> 34:42.819
but you don't get to--

34:42.863 --> 34:44.821
- I don't get to what,
Dr. Frome?

34:44.865 --> 34:46.084
Do my job?

34:46.127 --> 34:47.824
Which unlike you, Dr. Frome,

34:47.868 --> 34:49.913
I happen to take
very seriously.

34:49.957 --> 34:51.393
Oh, do you?

34:51.437 --> 34:54.135
- And, actually, while I have
you, let me ask you this.

34:54.179 --> 34:56.572
How many scheduled patients
did you see today?

34:56.616 --> 34:59.793
Um, scheduled?

34:59.836 --> 35:02.100
- Scheduled, yes, mm-hmm.
- One.

35:02.143 --> 35:03.623
Well, actually, I know that,

35:03.666 --> 35:06.234
because while you were
playing video games,

35:06.278 --> 35:08.106
the other five
were rescheduled.

35:08.149 --> 35:10.108
That's revenue
straight out the door.

35:10.151 --> 35:14.590
I just don't know
how much longer I can drag you

35:14.634 --> 35:17.115
by the ear
before I see some semblance

35:17.158 --> 35:18.638
of professional behavior
from you.

35:18.681 --> 35:20.770
- I called
each of those patients,

35:20.814 --> 35:22.250
and I rescheduled them.

35:22.294 --> 35:25.645
- As of now, you are no longer
chair of your department.

35:25.688 --> 35:27.777
Sorry, has to be done.

35:27.821 --> 35:29.823
- No, what?
What?

35:29.866 --> 35:34.044
- Dr. Bloom, you were going
to resign today as well.

35:34.088 --> 35:35.176
Is that correct?

35:38.136 --> 35:41.139
I was going to...

35:41.182 --> 35:44.359
but after everything
I've seen today...

35:46.100 --> 35:47.667
I'm staying.

35:47.710 --> 35:51.410
- Well, unfortunately, that's
not your decision to make.

35:51.453 --> 35:55.805
So I happily accept
your resignation,

35:55.849 --> 35:57.633
and I sincerely thank you

35:57.677 --> 35:59.592
for everything that you've done
for New Amsterdam.

36:04.553 --> 36:06.207
Mia..

36:06.251 --> 36:08.296
Mia, Mia...

36:08.340 --> 36:10.777
If you weren't
the sole practitioner

36:10.820 --> 36:13.214
of holistic medicine,
I would have no choice

36:13.258 --> 36:16.652
but to relieve you
of your duties as well.

36:16.696 --> 36:18.828
You had the chance
to come to me

36:18.872 --> 36:21.266
and to tell me the truth.

36:21.309 --> 36:23.224
And you chose not to.

36:25.705 --> 36:28.447
But I'm going to give you
a second chance,

36:28.490 --> 36:30.449
against my better judgment.

36:32.494 --> 36:34.496
But I certainly hope
you follow the lead

36:34.540 --> 36:36.237
of Dr. Reynolds in the future.

36:40.110 --> 36:43.070
You had the courage
to come forward

36:43.113 --> 36:45.594
and to alert me
about the resistance.

36:47.466 --> 36:49.424
Not just for your patients,

36:49.468 --> 36:52.384
but for all the patients
at New Amsterdam

36:52.427 --> 36:54.386
because you saw
that there was a possibility

36:54.429 --> 36:57.737
of doing them harm,
and our oath states

36:57.780 --> 37:02.611
that we must protect them
at all costs.

37:04.526 --> 37:06.441
And for that, I'm grateful.

37:08.008 --> 37:09.096
So please send me a list

37:09.139 --> 37:10.793
of the surgeries
you would like restored.

37:10.837 --> 37:13.622
And let's certainly hope
this never happens again.

37:15.755 --> 37:19.280
And if you'll excuse me,
I have a hospital to run.

37:29.029 --> 37:31.031
- Uh--

38:08.373 --> 38:10.549
- Hey.
- Floyd, have you seen Ma--

38:33.659 --> 38:37.315
- Out of the night
that covers me.

38:37.358 --> 38:40.013
Black as the pit
from pole to pole.

38:43.625 --> 38:48.369
<i>Thank whatever gods may be...</i>

38:48.413 --> 38:50.980
<i>for my unconquerable soul.</i>

38:53.505 --> 38:56.682
In the fell clutch
of circumstance,

38:56.725 --> 38:59.989
I have not winced
nor cried aloud.

39:02.905 --> 39:06.474
<i>Under the bludgeonings</i>
<i>of chance...</i>

39:06.518 --> 39:09.390
<i>my head is bloody</i>
<i>but unbowed.</i>

39:10.522 --> 39:12.524
Beyond this place
of wrath and tears

39:12.567 --> 39:15.265
looms but the horror
of the shade.

39:17.355 --> 39:20.662
<i>And yet, diminished</i>
<i>of the years</i>

39:20.706 --> 39:24.492
<i>finds and</i>
<i>shall find me unafraid.</i>

39:24.536 --> 39:26.886
In matters not
how straight the gate,

39:26.929 --> 39:29.497
how charged
with punishments the scroll.

39:29.541 --> 39:33.196
I am the master of my fate.

39:33.240 --> 39:36.156
I am the captain of my soul.

40:00.006 --> 40:03.705
- Heard about the meeting?
- From everyone.

40:05.925 --> 40:09.319
I keep thinking there's
something I should do, but...

40:09.363 --> 40:13.889
I try to remember that
it's just not my fight anymore.

40:13.933 --> 40:14.977
No?

40:19.460 --> 40:21.288
Let's grab Luna and go.

40:27.816 --> 40:29.514
What is it?

40:32.560 --> 40:34.040
I can't let you.

40:36.085 --> 40:38.740
I can't let you leave.

40:38.784 --> 40:41.526
- Helen--
- Because you're wrong, Max.

40:41.569 --> 40:44.529
Of course this is your fight.

40:44.572 --> 40:46.966
After what I saw today...

40:47.009 --> 40:50.448
This place...

40:50.491 --> 40:55.148
these patients, our friends...

40:55.191 --> 40:58.151
they're all losing.

40:58.194 --> 41:02.329
They're fighting back,
and they are losing...

41:02.372 --> 41:03.939
because you're not here.

41:03.983 --> 41:06.768
- I did everything
I could, Helen.

41:06.812 --> 41:09.423
I did everything I could,
and so did you

41:09.467 --> 41:13.209
to try to leave this place
better when we...

41:13.253 --> 41:14.950
And it didn't work out.

41:16.691 --> 41:19.128
And I have
to make peace with that.

41:19.172 --> 41:21.304
- No.
No, forget peace.

41:21.348 --> 41:23.089
This is war.

41:23.132 --> 41:26.005
So you need to stay here,
and you need to fight.

41:26.048 --> 41:28.790
You need to fight
alongside our friends.

41:28.834 --> 41:30.531
You need to fight
for this hospital.

41:30.575 --> 41:33.316
You have to fight
for my legacy and yours.

41:33.360 --> 41:35.884
And when you win...

41:35.928 --> 41:38.670
and you will win...

41:38.713 --> 41:40.628
then you get your ass
on a plane,

41:40.672 --> 41:43.631
and you come back to me,
do you understand?

41:45.546 --> 41:47.069
What if I lose you?

41:53.380 --> 41:55.338
Losing me is impossible.

42:00.605 --> 42:04.043
Now you get in there...

42:04.086 --> 42:07.437
and you show them
what you're made of.
