deconstructed poppy here?

09:42.216 --> 09:45.417
- Yes, I was inspired by
the interiors of the flowers...

09:45.419 --> 09:48.454
- Yeah, yeah.
- And how beautiful it is.

09:48.456 --> 09:52.091
<i>And the idea of it
kind of blooming back to life.</i>

09:52.093 --> 09:53.292
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

09:53.294 --> 09:55.827
- This challenge
has a deeper meaning to me,

09:55.829 --> 09:57.228
<i>coming from Afghanistan</i>

09:57.230 --> 10:00.631
<i>and coming into a
new beginning here in the U.S.</i>

10:00.633 --> 10:03.568
So I want to put
an emphasis on her breasts

10:03.570 --> 10:05.036
and around her hips.

10:05.038 --> 10:08.039
<i>It is a place print and
I have to get it 100% right.</i>

10:08.041 --> 10:09.507
Otherwise, if it's messed up,

10:09.509 --> 10:11.710
it's gonna mess up
the whole thing.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.845
<i>- Okay, the paper that
you have in the background,</i>

10:13.847 --> 10:15.313
<i>you want to get rid
of those little--</i>

10:15.315 --> 10:17.849
- Yeah, all that--all the--
All the white goes.

10:17.851 --> 10:19.384
It's too spaced out.
Yeah.

10:19.386 --> 10:21.386
Right now, it looks like
my grandmother's couch.

10:21.388 --> 10:25.123
- As you can see here, I want,
like, about an 18-inch repeat.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.858
Do you see on layer seven,

10:26.860 --> 10:30.761
those little peach
and yellow fan shapes?

10:30.763 --> 10:33.131
I've never worked with
a graphic designer in this way.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.066
<i>Usually, I do it.</i>

10:35.068 --> 10:36.735
I have full control
over what's happening.

10:38.937 --> 10:40.405
- I want to keep yellow,
keep the yellow.

10:42.007 --> 10:43.742
- No, no, keep the yellow.

10:43.744 --> 10:45.877
- Keep--keep the yellow.
Keep the yellow.

10:45.879 --> 10:47.545
As someone who
proclaims themselves

10:47.547 --> 10:49.881
to be a textile designer,
I was like,

10:49.883 --> 10:51.816
"Please let my textile
come out okay,

10:51.818 --> 10:54.052
so that I don't make
a fool of myself."

10:54.054 --> 10:56.822
But the circumstances
under which we are designing

10:56.824 --> 11:01.826
and creating are not normal,
so we'll see what happens.

11:01.828 --> 11:04.697
I--I want this shape over
the whole background repeated.

11:04.699 --> 11:05.698
Okay?

11:05.700 --> 11:06.966
- Okay. No, don't take--
Don't get rid of the yellow.

11:07.166 --> 11:15.166
<i>- So I got your floral image.</i>

11:17.912 --> 11:19.310
<i>What do you want to do with it?</i>

11:19.312 --> 11:20.980
<i>What's your idea?</i>

11:20.982 --> 11:23.781
- I want to take
my printed floral fabric

11:23.783 --> 11:25.583
and slash it up into strips.

11:25.585 --> 11:28.252
I want to create a print
with my print

11:28.254 --> 11:32.324
<i>and mix it with the hardness
of leather and grommets</i>

11:32.326 --> 11:34.125
<i>and silk gazar.</i>

11:34.127 --> 11:36.562
Yeah, I like that.
I like how it is now.

11:36.564 --> 11:38.764
I don't know what I want to do
for the bottom,

11:38.766 --> 11:40.699
but I do know that

11:40.701 --> 11:43.268
I like the direction
that I'm going in for the top.

11:43.270 --> 11:45.803
- I want more--
I want it to be more full,

11:45.805 --> 11:48.707
so if you can make
the flowers more visual.

11:48.709 --> 11:52.611
With this look, what I want
to do is I want to make

11:52.613 --> 11:58.116
<i>a mini cocktail halter dress
with a jacket</i>

11:58.118 --> 12:01.285
<i>that turns into, like,
this oversized flower bomb.</i>

12:01.287 --> 12:03.354
That's fine.
The flower colors are fine.

12:03.356 --> 12:05.757
- Well, this is my inspiration
for the coat

12:05.759 --> 12:07.158
and this for the jumpsuits.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.493
- That's cute.

12:08.495 --> 12:09.994
<i>- This is a challenge
where I want</i>

12:09.996 --> 12:11.463
<i>to push myself a little bit.</i>

12:19.905 --> 12:21.105
<i>The print I designed,</i>

12:21.107 --> 12:23.775
it's basically telling my story.

12:23.777 --> 12:27.046
<i>And that all stems
from coming from Afghanistan.</i>

12:27.048 --> 12:29.280
<i>It was a time of war.</i>

12:29.282 --> 12:32.883
You know, the Taliban's coming
in and suppressing women.

12:32.885 --> 12:36.454
<i>My birth mother died
escaping Afghanistan</i>

12:36.456 --> 12:38.856
<i>and being refugees in Pakistan.</i>

12:38.858 --> 12:40.591
It was such a rough road for me.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.893
It was a difficult time.

12:42.895 --> 12:46.665
<i>From there, I was adopted
by my uncle and aunt</i>

12:46.667 --> 12:48.332
<i>around the age
of eight years old.</i>

12:48.334 --> 12:49.801
<i>And for a long time,</i>

12:49.803 --> 12:52.004
<i>I was scared of how people
are going to treat me,</i>

12:52.006 --> 12:54.272
how they're going to look
at me differently.

12:54.274 --> 12:57.476
Let me try that shape.

12:57.478 --> 13:02.079
<i>- I would like to create
something that shows feminine</i>

13:02.081 --> 13:04.149
but strength at the same time.

13:04.151 --> 13:08.987
<i>So I think I'm going to create
a suit with three pieces:</i>

13:08.989 --> 13:12.690
<i>pants, jacket with a lot
of movement and volume,</i>

13:12.692 --> 13:13.958
<i>and a vest.</i>

13:13.960 --> 13:17.295
Woman in a suit, it means a lot.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.163
<i>It's so hard to be,
you know, like,</i>

13:19.165 --> 13:22.034
a mother
and a professional woman, too.

13:22.036 --> 13:25.036
<i>I'm sure that Katie and Chasity,</i>

13:25.038 --> 13:26.872
<i>they are living
the same situation.</i>

13:26.874 --> 13:31.309
Chasity have two babies.
Katie have four babies.

13:31.311 --> 13:32.311
This is hard.

13:32.313 --> 13:33.444
- Who'd you get for your model?

13:33.446 --> 13:35.112
- Roberta.
- Okay.

13:35.114 --> 13:38.249
I feel like I finally have the
challenge that I'm excited--

13:38.251 --> 13:40.385
Like I'm really
excited about, so.

13:40.387 --> 13:44.388
I feel like I can toe the line
between crafty and artsy

13:44.390 --> 13:46.325
<i>and I always want something
that I make</i>

13:46.327 --> 13:48.659
to be something that you could
not find in any store.

13:48.661 --> 13:51.529
It would need to be like
a Katie Kortman store.

13:51.531 --> 13:55.134
- Who's your model?
- I have Cassandra.

13:55.136 --> 13:56.335
- What are you making for her?

13:56.337 --> 13:58.402
- I think I'm making a jumpsuit.

13:58.404 --> 13:59.670
- Okay.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.272
<i>- I have a different
point of view.</i>

14:01.274 --> 14:02.774
<i>I represent someone</i>

14:02.776 --> 14:05.877
<i>who has been living
the regular everyday mom life,</i>

14:05.879 --> 14:08.346
<i>but I also come
from a background of art</i>

14:08.348 --> 14:10.581
<i>and expression and abstraction</i>

14:10.583 --> 14:15.219
<i>and I like that I merge
both of those worlds together</i>

14:15.221 --> 14:17.088
<i>to create fashion.</i>

14:17.090 --> 14:21.726

33:56.263 --> 33:58.730
I saw it
as a cover of "Vogue Arabia."

33:58.732 --> 34:02.668

do choose to wear the burqa,

34:02.670 --> 34:05.002

feel empowered.

<i>- Prajjé really delivered
on this challenge.</i>

39:30.463 --> 39:31.996
- He can tailor.

39:31.998 --> 39:33.764
<i>And he did have some
technical issues in the back.</i>

39:33.766 --> 39:35.032
- No, it was stunning.

39:35.034 --> 39:36.867
She could walk in it
and she could feel good in it.

39:36.869 --> 39:38.135
- Right.

39:38.137 --> 39:40.070
- It was really designed
keeping in mind his model.

39:40.072 --> 39:41.538
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

39:41.540 --> 39:44.208
- I was very moved
with Shantall's inspiration.

39:44.210 --> 39:50.215
- Hers was a really modern
graphic take on the flower.

39:50.217 --> 39:52.550
It made us look closer.

39:52.552 --> 39:55.352
- But I have to be
the devil's advocate here.

39:55.354 --> 39:57.622
This was a floral challenge.
- I knew you're gonna say that.

39:57.624 --> 40:01.458
<i>- Can we really allow
Shantall's look to win</i>

40:01.460 --> 40:03.794
when the floral note
was a whisper?

40:03.796 --> 40:07.765
- Elaine, sometimes a whisper
is more powerful than a scream.

40:07.767 --> 40:09.233
- But it was still bold.

40:09.235 --> 40:12.536
- Prajjé delivered against
the remit more specifically.

40:12.538 --> 40:15.172
<i>He took the floral challenge
head-on,</i>

40:15.174 --> 40:16.775
and he served it up to us

40:16.777 --> 40:18.309
in a way
that took our breath away.

40:18.311 --> 40:21.445
<i>- Shantall made three
spectacular pieces</i>

40:21.447 --> 40:25.550

and wear them independently.

40:25.552 --> 40:27.384

on the winner?

40:27.386 --> 40:28.719

40:28.721 --> 40:30.054
- Well, let's talk about
who should go home.

40:30.056 --> 40:31.723
Can we talk about Sabrina?
- Please.

40:31.725 --> 40:33.992
- You guys, Sabrina?
- I mean--

40:33.994 --> 40:35.559
- It is.
It's a hot mess.

40:35.561 --> 40:40.064
- She took a $3.99
fluorescent pink organza poly

40:40.066 --> 40:42.066
and she was willing
to go to bat for that.

40:42.068 --> 40:43.700
- You know, she said
she put the skirt on

40:43.702 --> 40:45.202
'cause
she didn't want to offend,

40:45.204 --> 40:47.204
but like really, if you look
at the message of why she had

40:47.206 --> 40:49.139
<i>the burqa with that outfit,
it's really beautiful.</i>

40:49.141 --> 40:53.445
- I like the print.
I know it could be polarizing.

40:53.447 --> 40:55.747
- Darren is somebody who knows
how to design.

40:55.749 --> 40:57.582
He is not yet a designer.

40:57.584 --> 40:58.850
- But you also have to know

40:58.852 --> 41:01.485

these garments

41:01.487 --> 41:03.554

or that you have to sell,

41:06.425 --> 41:10.027
and I don't think either way,
that outfit worked.

41:10.029 --> 41:12.563
- Let's talk about Katie.
- Chaotic.

41:12.565 --> 41:16.233
And the fact that Katie was
like, "It's Christian's fault."

41:16.235 --> 41:17.969
I'm like,
"Don't bring him into this."

41:17.971 --> 41:20.971
- Katie, to me, also had a lot
of bad fabric choices,

41:20.973 --> 41:23.907
not only in terms of that
leather that looked like felt.

41:23.909 --> 41:27.978
- Oh God, the scalloping.
- It looked like a costume.

41:27.980 --> 41:30.447
- So it's settled?

41:30.449 --> 41:30.514
Let's get the designers back
on the runway.

41:30.583 --> 41:38.583
