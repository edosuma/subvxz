WEBVTT

00:01.601 --> 00:02.536
You're absolutely right.

00:02.602 --> 00:04.204
[laughs]

00:04.270 --> 00:08.041
[crying]
All my baby birds
have left the nest.

00:08.108 --> 00:10.577
Synclaire is
your only baby bird.

00:10.644 --> 00:13.680
May I have my moment, please?

00:13.747 --> 00:16.783
Having successfully covered
the ugly blemish on her face

00:16.850 --> 00:19.052
the maid of honor
returns to the party

00:19.119 --> 00:20.053
where she'll, no doubt

00:20.120 --> 00:23.089
offer some words of wisdom.

00:23.156 --> 00:25.859
If you're looking for Max,
you'll find her in the closet

00:25.926 --> 00:28.161
with a busted up
camcorder next to her.

00:30.964 --> 00:33.399
Maxine, what
a thoughtful wedding gift.

00:33.466 --> 00:36.369
Endless hours of rambling
footage punctuated

00:36.436 --> 00:38.138
by grating commentary.

00:38.204 --> 00:41.241
Watch it or I'll shoot you
from an unflattering angle.

00:41.307 --> 00:43.276
Meaning, I'll work
your face into this shot.

00:44.778 --> 00:46.547
Excuse me, uh,
Madam Videographer

00:46.613 --> 00:48.014
but maybe my baby sister

00:48.081 --> 00:50.483
might wanna say a few words
to the soon‐to‐be‐wed.

00:50.551 --> 00:52.485
‐ Hook her up.
‐ Oh!

00:52.553 --> 00:53.887
Alright, come on, girl,
we're burning tape.

00:53.954 --> 00:55.221
Okay, okay, okay.

00:55.288 --> 00:57.190
Congratulations, Overton.

00:57.257 --> 00:59.125
Even though I know
when mom gets here tomorrow

00:59.192 --> 01:01.635
she'll probably
start in on her chorus of

01:01.702 --> 01:03.003
"It's you turn now, Olivia.

01:03.069 --> 01:05.438
Time to find a man
before your eggs dry up."

01:05.506 --> 01:07.107
[chuckles]

01:07.173 --> 01:08.108
Whoo!

01:08.174 --> 01:09.242
Alrighty, everybody.

01:09.308 --> 01:11.578
It's 24 hours
until the ceremony.

01:11.645 --> 01:13.814
That means, it's time
for you two to say bye‐bye

01:13.880 --> 01:15.448
until you exchange vows.

01:15.516 --> 01:17.350
So, when we see
each other at the alter

01:17.417 --> 01:19.352
it'll be like we're meeting
for the first time

01:19.419 --> 01:20.554
and, and thinkin'

01:20.621 --> 01:22.856
"Man, this is moving fast."

01:24.090 --> 01:25.191
Well, Sweet Pea

01:25.258 --> 01:27.928
time for your last kiss
as a unmarried woman.

01:27.994 --> 01:28.929
Okay.

01:33.934 --> 01:35.201
Oh, when you're 50 years old

01:35.268 --> 01:36.570
and too weak to pucker,
you'll thank me for this.

01:36.637 --> 01:38.805
Come on.
Get in there.

01:38.872 --> 01:40.807
Slip her the tongue.
Slip her the tongue.

you're pretty sturdy for a guy

who's about to walk
the plank tomorrow.

02:22.088 --> 02:24.758
Yeah, that's 'cause I got
a life preserver of love

02:24.825 --> 02:26.693
called Synclaire,
thanks to you.

02:26.760 --> 02:28.094
You know what,
I sure hope your wedding

02:28.161 --> 02:29.429
turns out better than mine.

02:29.495 --> 02:31.798
See, the bachelor party
was the night before.

02:31.865 --> 02:33.800
Bourbon and barbecue
till sun up.

02:33.867 --> 02:35.068
I must've had too much of both

02:35.135 --> 02:36.870
'cause 30 seconds after
I kissed the bride

02:36.937 --> 02:38.238
I was hugging the commode.

02:38.304 --> 02:39.405
[laughs]

02:39.472 --> 02:41.007
Uh, uh, how about a hot leg?

02:41.074 --> 02:43.176
Uh, no, after that picture
you just painted

02:43.243 --> 02:45.211
I'll have
a sip of water. Thanks.

02:46.647 --> 02:50.016
That's the thing about weddings.
Something always goes wrong.

02:50.083 --> 02:52.252
‐ Always?
‐ Oh, yeah.

02:52.318 --> 02:54.821
My best man lost the ring.

02:54.888 --> 02:57.223
To this day, Lilah
still hasn't forgiven me

02:57.290 --> 03:00.366
for slipping my wayward nephew's
nipple ring around her finger.

03:01.301 --> 03:02.235
Ouch.

03:02.302 --> 03:03.570
Look, I'm gonna go.

03:03.637 --> 03:06.673
See, 'cause the hot tub
at the hotel close at 9:00.

03:06.740 --> 03:07.908
I want to get in
a couple of more hours

03:07.974 --> 03:09.710
of smokin' and soakin'.

03:09.776 --> 03:11.011
I'm gonna take these legs.

03:11.077 --> 03:12.412
‐ Okay?
‐ 'Okay, okay.'

03:12.478 --> 03:13.714
I'm right behind you.

03:13.780 --> 03:14.981
Lilah wants
to go sightseeing

03:15.048 --> 03:18.719
which, roughly translated,
means, Bloomingdales.

03:18.785 --> 03:20.721
(Overton)
'Okay. See you tomorrow, dad.'

03:22.188 --> 03:23.724
Well, Kyle..

03:23.790 --> 03:26.760
My last night as a resident
of this here loft.

03:26.827 --> 03:29.229
I'm just glad Synclaire
and I found a little love nest

03:29.295 --> 03:30.797
right here in the building,
though.

03:30.864 --> 03:33.099
You know, Overton, man,
I really envy you.

03:33.166 --> 03:35.301
I mean, you're about to start
a lifelong relationship

03:35.368 --> 03:37.370
with a woman
who really loves you.

03:37.437 --> 03:39.940
Whereas I am stuck
in a twisted relationship

03:40.006 --> 03:41.942
with the devil's half‐sister.

03:43.376 --> 03:45.078
Yeah, but you keep on eating

03:45.145 --> 03:47.848
in hell's kitchen though,
don't you?

03:47.914 --> 03:49.950
You know, I just wish Max
was mature enough

03:50.016 --> 03:52.118
to accept a real relationship,
you know?

03:52.185 --> 03:53.920
I take it she wasn't phased
when you told her

03:53.987 --> 03:56.156
about your job offer
in London, huh?

03:56.222 --> 03:57.824
‐ I didn't tell her.
‐ What?

03:57.891 --> 04:00.360
Well, man,
every time I came close

04:00.426 --> 04:02.736
I just pictured her staring
at me with those bullet eyes

04:02.803 --> 04:04.738
saying, "So, the freak what?"

04:06.840 --> 04:08.374
Hey, as long as you two
have known each other

04:08.441 --> 04:10.777
she's got to develop
some kind of feelings for you.

04:10.844 --> 04:13.446
Hell, even a grizzly bear
can be taught to cuddle.

04:14.681 --> 04:16.349
Yeah, man, maybe you're right.

04:16.416 --> 04:18.250
I'll tell her
about London tonight.

04:18.317 --> 04:20.053
Hell, what have I got to lose?

04:20.120 --> 04:22.756
I already lost my dignity
the first time I slept with her.

that was laughed.

The toe‐curling sex with Obie.

05:00.126 --> 05:02.335
I just can't believe
that Synclaire

05:02.402 --> 05:03.570
is the first one
to get married.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.238
I always thought
it would be Regine.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.640
[voice breaking]
Me, too.

05:07.941 --> 05:10.544
Ladies and gentlemen,
the tears of a spinster.

05:12.679 --> 05:15.015
I have done everything

05:15.081 --> 05:17.050
to make myself eligible.

05:18.184 --> 05:21.421
I've‐I've read every book.

05:21.487 --> 05:23.757
I've‐I've‐I've kept
myself looking..

05:25.125 --> 05:26.392
Look at me.

05:28.629 --> 05:29.763
‐ Oh, my.
‐ Oh!

05:29.830 --> 05:31.264
‐ Hey, watch it.
‐ Oh, oh!

05:31.331 --> 05:33.534
‐ Hey, now.
‐ Alright, okay.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.569
What am I doing wrong?

05:36.236 --> 05:37.671
What about Russell?

05:37.738 --> 05:39.172
[groans]

05:39.239 --> 05:42.876
Well, he certainly has
a love Jones for you.

05:42.943 --> 05:44.310
Be true.

05:44.377 --> 05:48.248
Russell... is not
marriage material.

05:48.314 --> 05:50.083
Unless I wanted my first son

05:50.150 --> 05:52.619
to come out hittin'
on the nurse.

05:53.787 --> 05:55.288
[toilet flushes]

05:56.690 --> 05:59.392
I can't think of a more
appropriate time to share this.

06:03.537 --> 06:06.439
Marriage is for fools.

06:06.507 --> 06:08.074
'A wise person once said'

06:08.141 --> 06:09.876
"Men are good for two things.

06:09.943 --> 06:12.078
Sperm and support."

06:13.814 --> 06:15.381
Well, you can go
to a bank for sperm

06:15.448 --> 06:16.750
and strap on a bra
for support, so..

06:16.817 --> 06:17.751
[blows a raspberry]

06:19.986 --> 06:21.788
Max, that is a bunch of crap.

06:21.855 --> 06:24.490
Now, if you met the right man,
why wouldn't you make that move?

06:24.558 --> 06:27.493
I don't see you jumpin'
to tie the knot with Charles.

06:27.561 --> 06:29.930
Well, Charles and I are over.

06:30.697 --> 06:31.765
Considering his schedule

06:31.832 --> 06:33.900
the only way we'd
ever spend time together

06:33.967 --> 06:36.202
is if I went in
for another operation.

06:36.269 --> 06:38.939
Khadijah, he is a doctor.

06:39.940 --> 06:42.509

getting you engaged

06:42.576 --> 06:44.678

Don't you think?

[chuckles]

07:34.134 --> 07:35.301
Admit it, Max.

Um, I haven't given
them the answer yet.

I was kinda wondering
what you thought about it.

08:38.705 --> 08:40.573
As a matter of fact, uh

08:40.640 --> 08:42.808
an old law school buddy
from Philly

08:42.876 --> 08:45.311
has asked me
to be a partner in her firm.

08:45.378 --> 08:47.948

09:18.519 --> 09:19.620
You, too.

09:30.030 --> 09:31.231
I'm headed back
to the church.

09:31.297 --> 09:33.600
I got just enough time
to get a quick prayer in.

09:33.667 --> 09:35.736
You're gonna say a prayer
for Synclaire and Obie?

09:35.802 --> 09:38.505
Please, I got
bigger fish to fry.

09:38.572 --> 09:41.575
I've realized with all of
my husband‐hunting this year..

09:41.642 --> 09:42.809
Thanks.

09:42.876 --> 09:44.945
I've overlooked
my strongest resource.

09:45.011 --> 09:46.312
The almighty.

09:46.379 --> 09:48.782
Yeah, God should be
your full‐time love connection.

09:48.849 --> 09:50.784
Bump world peace and famine.

09:52.485 --> 09:54.955
Hey, don't forget to put
some lotion on them legs.

09:58.559 --> 10:00.460
Ah, hello, Maxine.

10:00.527 --> 10:02.335
[British accent]
Cheerio, mate.

10:02.402 --> 10:04.738
‐ What's that supposed to mean?
‐ Nothin'.

10:04.805 --> 10:07.240
Tally‐ho and all that rot.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.243
Well, I'll be damned.

10:10.310 --> 10:12.178
The maverick is
wounded by the news

10:12.245 --> 10:14.114
of my departure to London.

10:14.180 --> 10:15.849
[both chuckles]

10:15.916 --> 10:17.417
The Brits are going
to love you.

10:17.483 --> 10:18.685
They're big on pomposity.

10:18.752 --> 10:20.320
I'm gonna let you
have that last dig

10:20.386 --> 10:22.055
as a goin'‐away present.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.490
You give my regards to the city
of brotherly love, yeah?

10:25.692 --> 10:26.860
Oh, I will.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.962
Every single brother.

10:31.532 --> 10:32.833
[exhaling]

10:32.899 --> 10:34.801
Heh‐heh, you and Kyle
pull an all‐nighter?

10:34.868 --> 10:37.538
Nope, he was puffin'
about some job offer

10:37.604 --> 10:39.973
he got in London,
so I fired back

10:40.040 --> 10:42.709
that I was gonna go work
for my girl in Philly.

10:42.776 --> 10:43.944
Hey, Max, why do you
treat this thing

10:44.010 --> 10:46.747
with you and Kyle
like a game you have to win?

10:46.813 --> 10:48.148
What if he's the one?

10:48.214 --> 10:51.251
There is no one
for me, Khadijah.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.154
That stuff for people like, uh

10:54.220 --> 10:55.221
Synclaire and Overton.

10:55.288 --> 10:57.858
I, I am more evolved.

10:57.924 --> 11:00.426
Yeah, well, I hope
you don't find yourself

11:00.493 --> 11:02.468
a old woman
in a house full of cats

11:02.536 --> 11:04.771
dialin' 911 for company.

11:06.072 --> 11:08.742
Ooh, last time
I'll touch this bannister

11:08.809 --> 11:10.043
as a single woman.

11:10.110 --> 11:12.979
Last time I'll touch
this wall as a single woman.

11:13.046 --> 11:14.380
Last time I'll see you
stare at me

11:14.447 --> 11:16.983
with that confused look
as a single woman.

11:17.050 --> 11:19.219
Last time I'll touch this sofa
as a single woman.

11:19.285 --> 11:22.956
And now, he is ready
to meet his bride.

11:23.023 --> 11:23.957
[exhaling]

11:24.024 --> 11:25.859
Or‐or his maker.

11:25.926 --> 11:28.461
You have not eaten anything
in over 24 hours.

11:28.529 --> 11:30.196
Don't you want
a candy bar or somethin'?

11:30.263 --> 11:32.866
Oh, man, I‐I'll eat
when I get married.

11:32.933 --> 11:34.267
I don't wanna
kiss my new bride

11:34.334 --> 11:36.770
with nougat between my teeth.

11:36.837 --> 11:37.871
And about that ring.

11:37.938 --> 11:40.807
I got it, Overton.
Man, relax.

11:40.874 --> 11:42.543
‐ I am relaxed.
‐ Mm..

11:42.609 --> 11:44.444
‐ I'm the picture of relaxation.
‐ Uh‐huh.

11:44.511 --> 11:45.879
Hell, if I was
any more relaxed

11:45.946 --> 11:47.881
I'd probably just pass out.

11:50.551 --> 11:51.552
Girl, I don't know
how I'm gonna do it.

11:51.618 --> 11:53.687
Walking down
the aisle in heels

11:53.754 --> 11:55.589
Draggin' that big old train.

11:55.656 --> 11:59.292
[sighs]
Tryin' to see relatives
through all this gauze.

11:59.359 --> 12:00.300
[chuckling]

12:01.735 --> 12:03.169
Oh.

12:03.236 --> 12:05.305
Ooh, you're getting married.

12:07.908 --> 12:10.310
Why you leavin' me with Regine?

12:11.444 --> 12:12.946
‐ Oh.
‐ I'll miss you, boo.

12:13.013 --> 12:16.416
Oh, oh, woo‐woo‐woo, boo.

12:16.482 --> 12:18.719
Woo, woo, woo, boo.

12:18.785 --> 12:21.421
I mean, no matter
how much we say

12:21.487 --> 12:23.824
things won't change, they will.

12:23.890 --> 12:26.492
You'll call less and less.

12:26.560 --> 12:29.295
And then the letters
will stop.

12:29.362 --> 12:31.397
But, but I'll see you
when I come downstairs

12:31.464 --> 12:33.399
from my apartment, right?

12:35.836 --> 12:37.203
I guess.

12:37.270 --> 12:38.204
Alright.

12:38.271 --> 12:40.206
‐ Oh.
‐ Oh.

12:40.273 --> 12:42.776
Bye, Synclaire James.

12:45.946 --> 12:47.848
You feelin' any better, son?

12:47.914 --> 12:49.883
Yeah, a little bit, rev.

12:49.950 --> 12:52.252
Uh, look, I'm not gonna
get, uh, struck by lightning

12:52.318 --> 12:54.888
and nothin' for scarfing down
these communion wafers, am I?

12:54.955 --> 12:56.890
[chuckles]
Don't you worry about that.

12:56.957 --> 12:58.491
Uh, I haven't blessed them yet.

12:58.559 --> 13:01.768
Well, in that case,
can I get a swig of wine?

13:01.835 --> 13:05.071
There'll be plenty of time
for that after you're married.

13:05.138 --> 13:07.908
‐ I'll see you at the altar.
‐ Alright.

13:07.974 --> 13:08.942
[sighs]

13:09.009 --> 13:10.844
You're not nervous,
Overton, are you, man?

13:10.911 --> 13:13.146
‐ Give me that.
‐ Yeah, I'm nervous, man.

13:13.213 --> 13:14.681
My parents haven't showed up.

13:14.748 --> 13:18.084
I‐I just passed out, and
I still ain't seen that ring.

13:18.151 --> 13:20.987
Here, look. Satisfied?

13:21.054 --> 13:24.525
Man, I hope I'm not this
jittery the day of my wedding.

13:24.591 --> 13:27.393
Yeah, that's 'cause you'd be
too busy arguin' with Max

13:27.460 --> 13:29.530
over who's gonna wear the tux.

13:31.264 --> 13:32.999
‐ Max?
‐ Yeah.

13:33.066 --> 13:35.669
I mean, tragic as it is, shorty

13:35.736 --> 13:37.103
she's your destiny.

13:39.239 --> 13:41.141
What have we here?

13:41.207 --> 13:43.844
A brick house
in the house of the Lord.

13:46.146 --> 13:47.948
Hey, Russell.

13:48.014 --> 13:50.751
Have I ever thanked you for that
lunch we had the other day?

13:50.817 --> 13:52.919
That was six months ago.

13:52.986 --> 13:55.255
And I gave you the chance
to thank me properly

13:55.321 --> 13:57.123
but you kept your clothes on.

14:00.360 --> 14:03.303
Baby, don't run off like that.
I missed you crazy.

14:08.675 --> 14:09.910
Regine, Tanya.

14:09.976 --> 14:11.111
Tanya, Regine.

14:11.177 --> 14:12.312
Charmed.

14:13.547 --> 14:15.148
[chuckles]
Ah, come on, Russell.

14:15.215 --> 14:17.551
Let's see how our names look
together in the guest book.

14:22.923 --> 14:25.258
A man can't wait
forever, Regine.

14:29.295 --> 14:30.631
(Max)
'Hey, girl.'

14:30.697 --> 14:33.099
Aren't you the sorriest‐looking
fireplug on the street, girl?

14:33.166 --> 14:35.401
You look tore up.
What's wrong with you?

14:35.468 --> 14:36.703
Oh, you're pathetic,
you know that.

14:36.770 --> 14:38.371
Phony concern from somebody

14:38.438 --> 14:40.974
who only cries when
we run out of Miracle Whip.

14:42.876 --> 14:44.811
I care.

14:44.878 --> 14:46.847
And to prove it,
here's something

14:46.913 --> 14:48.849
that's sure to cheer you up.

14:50.517 --> 14:54.220
Kyle and I have been
seeing each other for months.

14:58.124 --> 15:00.193
But it's over now

15:00.260 --> 15:03.403
and you missed every
freaky‐sneaky detail.

15:05.138 --> 15:08.809
Oh. And everybody knew, but you.

15:13.346 --> 15:15.281
Alright, ladies, one minute.

15:18.752 --> 15:19.686
[door slams]

15:21.221 --> 15:24.290
‐ Oh, hi, Khadijah.
‐ Hey.

15:24.357 --> 15:26.492
Uh, Max, can I talk
to you for a minute?

15:26.560 --> 15:28.328
Alright..

15:29.563 --> 15:31.431
Uh..

15:31.497 --> 15:33.634
Look, after all
we've been through

15:33.700 --> 15:36.803
it doesn't seem right
to end on such a sour note.

15:36.870 --> 15:39.673
So I just wanted
to tell you that, uh

15:39.740 --> 15:41.708
I really have enjoyed
knowing you.

15:41.775 --> 15:44.678
Despite our numerous
psychotic episodes.

15:46.379 --> 15:49.650
Knowing you hasn't been
entirely stomach‐turning.

15:49.716 --> 15:51.852
[chuckles]

15:51.918 --> 15:55.889
Well, anyway, um, I have decided
to take that job in London.

15:55.956 --> 15:58.258
‐ Onward and upward.
‐ Yeah.

15:58.324 --> 16:00.827
So, um, if you ever feel like

16:00.894 --> 16:03.136
legally driving
on the wrong side of the road

16:03.203 --> 16:04.705
give me a call.

16:06.607 --> 16:07.874
I love you.

16:12.713 --> 16:14.515
Wh‐what?

16:14.581 --> 16:15.782
Huh?

16:15.849 --> 16:17.017
Come on, you guys!
Come on.

16:17.083 --> 16:19.485
We got 30 seconds. Let's go.

16:30.531 --> 16:33.433
Hey, try and walk like a lady.

16:34.568 --> 16:35.502
Go.

16:38.672 --> 16:40.741
[whispering]
Max, stop it!

16:40.807 --> 16:43.510
Excuse me. I just can't
stop staring at you.

16:43.577 --> 16:46.112
Would you like
to have dinner sometime?

16:46.179 --> 16:47.447
Desmond Howard?

16:47.514 --> 16:49.983
Yep, I'm Overton's cousin,
Smoke Eye's son.

16:51.217 --> 16:54.320
Oh. Oh, save me a dance
at the reception.

16:57.157 --> 16:59.459
Oh, thank you.

16:59.526 --> 17:01.668
You're good
and you're fast.

17:05.105 --> 17:06.507
Whoo. Okay.

17:07.941 --> 17:09.976
Alright, boo,
I'm goin' in.

17:10.042 --> 17:12.512
Alright, you warm up
the crowd for me, okay?

17:12.579 --> 17:15.048
Okay. Okay.
Y'all watch my back.

17:15.115 --> 17:16.382
Keep me company.

17:16.449 --> 17:18.318
[instrumental music]

17:18.384 --> 17:21.221
(Synclaire)
'Okay.'

17:21.287 --> 17:23.289
Now, you make sure
you walk real slow, okay?

17:23.356 --> 17:25.592
I know, you want
to savor the moment.

17:25.659 --> 17:26.693
That, and I'm afraid
of slippin'

17:26.760 --> 17:28.493
on all those rose petals
out there.

17:28.561 --> 17:30.330
[laughing]
I love you.

17:30.396 --> 17:32.188
Oh, I love you, too, daddy.

17:32.188 --> 17:33.192
Come on.

17:39.039 --> 17:41.975
<i>["Wedding March" plays]</i>

17:48.815 --> 17:50.416
This is so beautiful.

17:50.483 --> 17:52.553
[sobbing]
Yes, it is.

17:53.687 --> 17:55.589
Now, I gotta get Regine hitched

17:55.656 --> 17:58.058
so she can get
some beans in that oven.

17:58.124 --> 17:59.960
Okay.

18:00.026 --> 18:01.568
Dearly beloved

18:01.635 --> 18:04.437
this is indeed a glorious day.

18:04.505 --> 18:05.572
Come on, shake a leg, Otis.

18:05.639 --> 18:07.073
Our pumpkin's about
to tie the knot.

18:07.140 --> 18:08.441
Odelle, I told you.

18:08.509 --> 18:11.211
Travel by bus is
cost‐effective and timely.

18:11.277 --> 18:14.047
Fine. You take
the bus back. I'm flying.

18:14.114 --> 18:17.450
Two of God's children,
Overton and Synclaire

18:17.518 --> 18:19.953
'are going to be
joined as one.'

18:24.024 --> 18:26.359
And now the maid of honor
and best man

18:26.426 --> 18:28.695
will pay tribute
to our blessed couple

18:28.762 --> 18:31.665
