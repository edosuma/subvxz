00:02.128 --> 00:03.459
Previously on "Teen Wolf..."

00:03.671 --> 00:05.286
You know what I want for my birthday?

00:05.465 --> 00:07.126
To not be a 17-year-old virgin.

00:10.553 --> 00:12.544
Stiles, all her friends
say you were the last person who saw her.

00:12.763 --> 00:14.014
You wanna help?

00:14.223 --> 00:15.303
Find something real.

00:15.516 --> 00:18.303
- Okay, they're on our side now.
- Well, then maybe you should tell her

00:18.478 --> 00:20.218
what her mother
was actually trying to do that night.

00:20.438 --> 00:22.019
There's a dead body. It's Erica.

00:22.231 --> 00:23.391
Who's the other girl?

00:23.608 --> 00:24.848
The one locked in there with Boyd?

00:25.485 --> 00:27.066
She's my sister, my younger sister.

00:27.278 --> 00:28.358
Scott, you gotta get out of there.

00:28.571 --> 00:29.981
They haven't felt the full moon in months.

00:30.156 --> 00:31.771
No! Don't break the seal!

01:03.314 --> 01:04.269
Got one!

01:09.445 --> 01:10.560
What are you doing, dumbass?

01:10.780 --> 01:12.236
You're supposed to put holes in the lid.

01:12.448 --> 01:14.063
Otherwise you'll kill them.

01:14.283 --> 01:15.318
Do l have to let him go?

01:15.535 --> 01:17.400
Do you want him to die?

01:47.775 --> 01:48.764
Billy?

01:52.697 --> 01:54.062
Run! Run!

02:14.927 --> 02:16.918
He's gonna get in. He's gonna get inside.

02:17.138 --> 02:18.594
Shut up. Shut up.

03:18.908 --> 03:19.943
You lost them?

03:20.159 --> 03:21.990
Yeah, I kind of had to.

03:23.996 --> 03:25.281
Wasn't exactly the plan.

03:25.498 --> 03:27.830
I know, which is why I think
that we should stick together.

03:28.042 --> 03:28.997
Trust me, he's too strong, too fast,

03:29.210 --> 03:31.826
and way too angry
for one person to handle.

03:32.046 --> 03:33.126
We've got to do this together.

03:33.339 --> 03:35.000
Look, I'm at the trails
by the entrance to the preserve.

03:35.216 --> 03:36.831
- Can you meet me here?
- Yeah.

03:37.051 --> 03:39.508
Just got to drop something off first.

04:36.861 --> 04:38.977
Mom, I'm going to the store.

04:41.031 --> 04:42.692
Mom, do you hear me?

04:43.451 --> 04:45.157
Of course you didn't.

04:45.911 --> 04:48.402
You would have heard me
screaming like a lunatic.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.165
Lunatic.

05:10.227 --> 05:11.637
Is it them?

05:12.104 --> 05:14.186
We're not the only ones
that decided to stick together.

05:15.483 --> 05:18.099
Is that gonna make it easier
or harder to catch them?

05:18.569 --> 05:19.809
I don't know.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.106
Derek.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.201
I saw Boyd try to rip two little kids apart.

05:31.540 --> 05:33.201
Are they gonna do that
to everyone they find?

05:34.877 --> 05:35.866
Everyone and anyone.

06:13.123 --> 06:14.158
Oh, God.

06:30.224 --> 06:31.760
Oh, my God.

06:31.976 --> 06:34.092
Oh, my God, please don't be dead.

06:34.603 --> 06:37.720
Please don't be dead.
Please don't be dead. Please don't be dead.

06:39.191 --> 06:40.351
Please don't be dead.

06:40.568 --> 06:42.854
Please don't be dead. Please don't be dead.

06:45.531 --> 06:46.896
Oh, my God.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.369
Are you kidding me?

07:38.751 --> 07:39.866
She tried killing you.

07:42.004 --> 07:43.164
Yeah, yeah.

07:43.505 --> 07:45.166
Why didn't you tell me?

07:46.759 --> 07:47.919
I'll tell you everything, okay?

07:48.135 --> 07:49.966
I'll tell you anything that you want to know,
but right now...

07:50.179 --> 07:51.589
Just tell me why.

07:55.935 --> 07:57.175
l... I couldn't.

07:59.563 --> 08:02.270
Allison, I couldn't let that be
the last memory that you had of her.

08:31.762 --> 08:32.717
You coming?

08:32.930 --> 08:35.387
Okay,
there is a snake out here the size of a train.

08:35.557 --> 08:37.934
- Then kick it.
- Uh, yeah, if I kick it,

08:38.143 --> 08:41.635
it will swallow my foot
and drag me back down to Mordor.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.356
Then jump over it.

08:46.402 --> 08:48.563
Oh! Oh, whoa, whoops, whoa.

08:49.113 --> 08:50.444
Oh.

08:50.614 --> 08:51.694
Wow.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.815
Nice touch.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.289
You're nervous.

09:04.461 --> 09:05.746
You make me nervous.

09:06.964 --> 09:09.125
That a good thing or a bad thing?

09:09.550 --> 09:10.539
All good.

09:13.971 --> 09:16.132
Ooh, ooh. That is a mood killer, though.

09:20.769 --> 09:22.100
Better?

09:22.312 --> 09:23.472
Better.

09:42.791 --> 09:44.827
- I can't... I can't be in here, I...
- Emily, wait!

09:45.544 --> 09:46.704
Emily!

10:00.225 --> 10:01.305
Emily?

10:02.686 --> 10:04.392
Emily?

10:04.605 --> 10:06.721
Emily, where are you?

10:06.940 --> 10:08.146
Emily!

10:12.529 --> 10:13.518
Em?

10:38.972 --> 10:40.678
Emily, where are you?

10:41.600 --> 10:42.715
Emily!

11:43.370 --> 11:45.156
- Are you okay?
- What?

11:45.873 --> 11:47.033
Are you all right?

11:48.667 --> 11:50.328
You need to get out of here, okay?

11:51.044 --> 11:51.999
Get out of the woods.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.668
Get out of here as fast as you can.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.804
Lydia? Lydia?

12:05.017 --> 12:07.133
- Lydia, are you okay?
- I'm okay.

12:07.352 --> 12:08.967
That, over there,

12:10.314 --> 12:11.474
not okay.

12:12.816 --> 12:14.352
Yeah, all right. I'm gonna call my dad.

12:14.568 --> 12:16.058
I already called 911.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.851
You called the police before you called me?

12:18.238 --> 12:20.854
I'm supposed to call you first
when | find a dead body?

12:21.074 --> 12:22.154
Yes!

12:24.661 --> 12:26.276
- Are you sure?
- Yep.

12:26.455 --> 12:28.446
Throat ripped out, blood everywhere.

12:28.665 --> 12:29.996
It's like the freaking "Shining" over here.

12:30.209 --> 12:31.699
If two little twin girls
come out of the woods,

12:31.919 --> 12:33.204
start asking me
to play with them forever and ever,

12:33.420 --> 12:34.535
I'm not gonna be surprised.

12:34.755 --> 12:36.586
Can you get a little closer
to make sure it was them?

12:36.757 --> 12:37.712
Make sure it was them?

12:37.883 --> 12:39.748
Scott, who else is going
around ripping throats out?

12:39.927 --> 12:41.713
Please just do it.

12:57.486 --> 12:59.147
This doesn't make any sense.

12:59.404 --> 13:01.190
The public pool is all the way
on the other side of the woods.

13:01.406 --> 13:02.987
We haven't tracked them
anywhere near there.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.360
Derek, they killed someone.

13:04.701 --> 13:06.077
- How are they moving so fast?
- Derek.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.992
They can't be that fast on foot.

13:08.205 --> 13:09.695
They killed someone.

13:10.249 --> 13:13.616
Some totally innocent kid is dead.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.671
And it's our fault.

13:19.841 --> 13:20.830
It's my fault.

13:21.051 --> 13:22.166
We need help.

13:22.719 --> 13:23.754
We have Isaac now.

13:23.929 --> 13:25.009
I mean real help.

13:27.349 --> 13:29.260
They're too fast for us, for all of us.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.216
They're too strong, too rabid.

13:31.436 --> 13:33.017
- We'll catch them.
- What happens if we do?

13:33.230 --> 13:35.596
We're just gonna hold them down
until the sun comes up?

13:37.776 --> 13:40.188
Maybe it would be easierjust to kill them.

13:40.904 --> 13:43.395
Killing them isn't the right thing to do.

13:43.615 --> 13:45.025
What if it's the only thing to do?

13:46.159 --> 13:48.696
If we can't even catch them,
what else do we do?

13:49.413 --> 13:51.324
Find someone
who knows what they're doing.

13:51.540 --> 13:52.620
Who?

13:53.458 --> 13:56.165
Someone who knows
how to hunt werewolves.

14:05.220 --> 14:06.300
So, Caitlin,

14:06.513 --> 14:08.674
you and Emily,
were the two of you drinking?

14:09.599 --> 14:10.930
No, no.

14:11.143 --> 14:12.349
Anything else?

14:12.561 --> 14:13.550
Caitlin?

14:14.688 --> 14:16.303
We split a tab of X.

14:18.108 --> 14:20.975
Well, MDMA can cause hallucinations,

14:21.194 --> 14:23.856
and it could've been laced
with something, too.

14:24.072 --> 14:25.608
You think I hallucinated.

14:25.991 --> 14:29.825
You think you saw a girl
with glowing eyes and fangs?

14:29.995 --> 14:31.280
And claws.

14:33.206 --> 14:36.494
Hey, we're gonna get you to the hospital,
figure out exactly what it was that you took.

14:36.710 --> 14:38.325
What about the other three?
The three guys?

14:38.545 --> 14:41.161
We'll need better descriptions of them, too.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.802
Let's get an APB out on Emily.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.930
The other girl, too, as soon as we get
something better than claws and fangs.

14:53.352 --> 14:54.808
You believe her?

14:57.230 --> 14:58.731
She saw something.

14:59.316 --> 15:01.056
YOU mean someone.

15:09.201 --> 15:11.487
It has to be the one with the eggs.

15:24.091 --> 15:25.126
Uh...

15:25.300 --> 15:26.289
gene;

15:27.010 --> 15:29.467
- Do you think this is gonna work?
- Nope.

15:29.638 --> 15:30.753
Me neither.

15:33.141 --> 15:36.258
So your, uh... Your sister.

15:41.483 --> 15:43.189
Sorry, yeah, it's...

15:43.402 --> 15:44.892
It's bad timing. I'm sorry.

15:46.196 --> 15:48.152
I'll ask later. It's fine.

15:51.785 --> 15:52.991
Or never.

15:53.203 --> 15:54.693
Yeah, yeah, I'm good with never.

15:54.913 --> 15:57.325
First of all, why would I care
about anyone related to Derek?

15:57.541 --> 15:59.372
And second, I don't know this kid Boyd.

15:59.584 --> 16:00.994
I don't even know his last name.

16:01.211 --> 16:02.246
Boyd is his last name.

16:02.796 --> 16:04.457
- What's his first name?
- Vernon.

16:06.049 --> 16:07.585
And just curious,

16:08.093 --> 16:10.254
is there a reason the gun
is still pointed at me?

16:12.264 --> 16:14.630
There's probably still some part of
me that wants to shoot you.

16:16.059 --> 16:17.344
I get that.

16:21.356 --> 16:25.440
Scott, I watched my father
brainwash my daughter,

16:27.195 --> 16:28.981
almost turn her into a killer.

16:30.198 --> 16:33.315
That world, your world decimated mine.

16:33.535 --> 16:36.993
My wife, sister, father, my entire family.

16:37.205 --> 16:38.820
Why would I ever step foot in it again?

16:39.958 --> 16:42.165
Because people are going to die.

16:43.462 --> 16:45.544
And because you know how
to catch Boyd and Cora

16:45.755 --> 16:46.881
without killing them.

16:49.843 --> 16:51.174
I'm sorry.

16:52.095 --> 16:53.335
I can't help you.

16:56.224 --> 16:57.509
Um...

17:00.854 --> 17:03.971
Do you think you could do me,
like, one little, tiny favor?

17:22.209 --> 17:23.574
- Left or straight?
- Left.

17:23.793 --> 17:26.660
Sorry. It's right around the corner.
That parking lot there.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.713
Yeah, just a little further up,
right here.

17:47.150 --> 17:49.106
Thanks again for the ride.

17:52.572 --> 17:55.530
They did this? Boyd and...

17:56.117 --> 17:57.152
Cora.

18:01.540 --> 18:03.496
Where's the last place you saw them?

18:05.210 --> 18:07.041
- You're tracking them by print?
- Trying to.

18:07.212 --> 18:09.168
Well, then, you've been wasting your time.

18:10.215 --> 18:13.252
There's only one creature on earth
that can visually track footprints,

18:14.219 --> 18:15.504
and that's man.

18:15.720 --> 18:17.051
And if you're not trained like me,

18:17.222 --> 18:19.053
you have no idea that this print is Boyd's

18:19.266 --> 18:20.631
- and these...
- Are Cora's.

18:20.850 --> 18:23.136
Nope. They're yours.

18:23.812 --> 18:27.020
You trampled Cora's
as soon as you walked over here.

18:27.190 --> 18:29.772
Listen, I know the three of you
are focusing half your energy

18:29.985 --> 18:33.102
on resisting your own urges
under the full moon,

18:33.321 --> 18:36.028
but that puts you at
a severe disadvantage to Boyd and Cora,

18:36.199 --> 18:37.530
who have fully given in.

18:37.742 --> 18:38.993
They put the pedal to the floor

18:39.160 --> 18:40.866
while you three are barely
hitting the speed limit.

18:41.371 --> 18:42.702
So what do we do?

18:42.872 --> 18:45.124
Focus on your sense of smell.

18:45.959 --> 18:47.574
Actual wolves are known to track their prey

18:47.794 --> 18:50.706
by up to 100 miles a day by scent.

18:50.922 --> 18:53.789
A trained hunter can use scent
to track them.

19:03.351 --> 19:04.386
If the wind is with them,

19:04.603 --> 19:07.060
wolves can track a scent
by a distance of two miles,

19:07.230 --> 19:09.061
which means we can draw them to us...

19:09.816 --> 19:11.181
...or into a trap.

19:12.319 --> 19:15.026
Full moon does give us one advantage.

19:15.196 --> 19:16.777
They'll have a higher heat signature,

19:17.198 --> 19:19.484
which makes them easier
to spot with infrared.

19:29.044 --> 19:31.410
Thanks, but I've got my own.

19:32.547 --> 19:35.084
Just remember,
we're not hunting wild animals.

19:35.258 --> 19:39.251
Underneath those impulses
are two intelligent human beings.

19:39.888 --> 19:42.004
Don't think they can't rely
on that human side.

19:42.390 --> 19:44.767
It's suppressed, but it's there,

19:45.852 --> 19:49.845
reminding them how to mask their
scent, how to cover their tracks,

19:50.065 --> 19:51.646
how to survive.

20:06.206 --> 20:08.071
When's the last time you saw your sister?

20:08.500 --> 20:10.206
Nine years.

20:10.418 --> 20:12.249
I thought she died in the fire.

20:13.213 --> 20:15.579
Do you feel like
you have a lock on her scent?

20:18.718 --> 20:22.006
Scott, how confident are you in your skills?

20:22.222 --> 20:24.133
Honestly, most of the time,

20:24.307 --> 20:27.595
I'm trying not to think
about all the things I can smell.

20:31.231 --> 20:34.723
The problem is when they breach the woods
and hit the residential area.

20:34.943 --> 20:38.185
Once they're past the high school,
they're right in the middle of Beacon Hills.

20:38.405 --> 20:41.272
They're not gonna kill
everything they see, are they?

20:42.075 --> 20:43.155
No.

20:44.327 --> 20:47.535
But there is an important difference
to recognize.

20:49.457 --> 20:52.415
Wolves hunt for food.
At a certain point, they get full.

20:52.627 --> 20:55.539
Boyd and Cora are hunting
for the pleasure of the kill,

20:55.755 --> 20:59.498
for some primal apex
predatory satisfaction

20:59.718 --> 21:02.926
that comes from the ripping
of warm bodies to bloody shreds.

21:03.138 --> 21:05.254
And who knows
when that need gets satiated?

21:05.473 --> 21:06.758
We can't kill them.

21:07.225 --> 21:08.635
What if we can't catch them?

21:11.938 --> 21:14.520
Then maybe we just need to contain them.

21:15.692 --> 21:17.648
There's no one in the school at night,
is there?

21:17.944 --> 21:19.229
You want to trap them inside?

21:19.696 --> 21:22.403
If there's somewhere
with a strong enough door,

21:22.615 --> 21:24.651
no windows or access to the outside.

21:24.868 --> 21:26.984
What about the boiler room?

21:27.203 --> 21:28.739
It's just one big steel door.

21:31.958 --> 21:33.619
You're sure the school's empty?

21:34.294 --> 21:35.830
It has to be.

21:36.504 --> 21:39.462
There can't be anyone there this late, right?

22:05.325 --> 22:07.031
These are ultrasonic emitters.

22:07.243 --> 22:09.450
It's one of the tools
we use to corral werewolves,

22:10.038 --> 22:12.370
pushing them into a direction
we want them to run.

22:13.958 --> 22:16.335
Gives off a high-pitched frequency
that only they can hear.

22:17.086 --> 22:18.121
No kidding!

22:23.176 --> 22:25.041
These are gonna drive them to the school?

22:25.261 --> 22:28.003
And then it's up to you
to get them into the basement.

22:28.223 --> 22:32.011
Does anyone else want to rethink
the plan where we just kill them?

22:32.227 --> 22:33.888
It's going to work.

22:37.190 --> 22:38.600
It'll work.

23:34.789 --> 23:36.529
You didn't have to follow me home.

23:36.749 --> 23:38.910
I just wanted to make sure you got in okay.

23:39.127 --> 23:40.992
I had a police escort.

23:41.212 --> 23:43.294
I know the inner workings
of that force, all right?

23:43.464 --> 23:45.000
They're not nearly as reliable
as people think.

23:45.216 --> 23:47.593
Well, you also didn't have
to follow me into my room.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.045
Well, I...

23:51.723 --> 23:54.806
Uh, yeah, I don't have an answer for that.

23:55.018 --> 23:56.178
I can leave.

23:56.394 --> 23:59.136
Are you really gonna go
without asking me the question

23:59.355 --> 24:02.688
that you've been dying to ask me?

24:03.318 --> 24:06.981
Well, I'm not...
I haven't been dying to ask anything.

24:07.196 --> 24:08.936
No questions here for Stiles.

24:09.198 --> 24:10.358
Nothing.

24:11.492 --> 24:13.153
I can see it on your face.

24:14.704 --> 24:18.697
Maybe my face just has, like,
a naturally interrogatory expression.

24:19.208 --> 24:22.575
Well, your interrogatory expression
is getting on my nerves.

24:29.010 --> 24:32.844
The answer is, I have no clue
how I ended up finding that body.

24:34.390 --> 24:37.097
I didn't even know where I was
until I got out of the car.

24:37.769 --> 24:39.976
Yeah, but the last time
something like this happened...

24:44.817 --> 24:46.148
Derek's uncle.

24:49.405 --> 24:50.565
Peter.

24:51.574 --> 24:54.862
And the hunted becomes the hunter.

24:55.912 --> 24:59.154
You really think a few
high-tech dog whistles are gonna help?

24:59.374 --> 25:01.740
I don't see you offering a hand.

25:03.378 --> 25:05.710
Personally, I'm trying
to cut down on futile endeavors.

25:06.214 --> 25:07.329
Cora's alive.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.296
I heard.

25:09.509 --> 25:10.794
Let's throw the reunion party

25:11.010 --> 25:12.966
when she's not
an unstoppable killing machine.

25:13.179 --> 25:14.680
- I can stop her.
- Sure you can.

25:14.889 --> 25:16.470
By killing her.

25:16.641 --> 25:19.178
Which happens
to be the point of this little exercise.

25:19.394 --> 25:21.931
Deucalion wants you to kill them.

25:22.146 --> 25:23.761
He wants you to get rid of his baggage,

25:23.982 --> 25:25.847
making it easier for you to join his pack.

25:26.067 --> 25:27.978
The fact that it was supposed to happen
in the vault,

25:28.194 --> 25:32.483
and not up here,
out in the open, doesn't change his plan.

25:32.699 --> 25:36.817
It just means that Boyd and Cora
are gonna kill a few innocent people first.

25:37.203 --> 25:39.615
And I should just let them?

25:39.831 --> 25:41.742
I should be okay
with innocent people dying?

25:42.125 --> 25:43.865
Unless you're okay killing your own.

25:45.044 --> 25:45.999
I can catch them.

25:46.212 --> 25:47.167
Oh, come on.
How much damage can they do?

25:47.380 --> 25:50.747
So they off a few homeless people,
a drunk stumbling out of a bar too late.

25:50.967 --> 25:53.128
So what?
Let Scott deal with it.

25:53.344 --> 25:56.006
Let him be the hero
of his morally black and white world.

25:56.222 --> 25:59.555
The real survivors, you and I,

26:00.768 --> 26:02.429
we live in shades of gray.

26:03.563 --> 26:06.305
Then again, even if you did kill
them, you're still an Alpha.

26:13.448 --> 26:16.030
You can always make more werewolves.

26:23.499 --> 26:24.534
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:24.751 --> 26:25.991
Over here.

26:26.210 --> 26:28.041
And if you tell anyone
that I showed you this,

26:28.254 --> 26:30.495
I swear to God,
I will kill you painfully and slowly.

26:30.673 --> 26:32.834
Why do you want
to show me a body I've already seen?

26:33.051 --> 26:35.212
Because you haven't seen everything.

26:38.556 --> 26:39.841
See this around his neck?

26:40.058 --> 26:42.299
That's a ligature mark.
That means that he was strangled

26:42.518 --> 26:45.134
with something, like cord, rope...

26:45.354 --> 26:46.890
Ah, okay, wait a second.

26:47.106 --> 26:49.062
What kind of werewolf
strangles someone?

26:49.275 --> 26:52.517
You know, that's not very werewolf-y.

26:52.695 --> 26:54.356
My thoughts exactly.

26:54.572 --> 26:55.652
And then there's this.

27:01.871 --> 27:04.613
God, man, what is that?
Is that brain matter?

27:04.832 --> 27:06.288
Yeah, it's brain matter, of course.

27:07.210 --> 27:08.245
See the indentation?

27:08.461 --> 27:11.919
He was hit in the back of the head,
hard enough to kill him.

27:12.131 --> 27:14.873
In fact, any one of these things
could have killed him.

27:15.093 --> 27:17.709
I mean, someone seriously
wanted this poor kid dead.

27:17.929 --> 27:20.841
All right, so then this couldn't have
been Boyd or Cora, you know?

27:21.057 --> 27:22.513
They wouldn't have done all that.

27:22.683 --> 27:23.934
So maybe this is just one murder.

27:24.102 --> 27:26.935
I mean,
maybe it's just a random coincidence.

27:27.146 --> 27:29.387
- I don't think it was just one.
- How come?

27:30.024 --> 27:34.017
Because that girl over there,
she's got the exact same injuries.

28:02.056 --> 28:03.512
Do you see that?

28:05.226 --> 28:06.591
Yeah, it's a firefly.

28:07.687 --> 28:09.427
No, no, I know, it...

28:10.189 --> 28:11.144
What?

28:13.109 --> 28:14.349
It's, uh... It's very unusual.

28:14.569 --> 28:18.653
The California fireflies
aren't bio-luminescent.

28:20.199 --> 28:21.484
They don't glow.

28:24.162 --> 28:25.151
Does that mean something?

28:54.483 --> 28:56.064
Oh, great.

29:03.659 --> 29:04.694
Come on.

29:16.964 --> 29:18.170
They're not
going through the school.

29:19.091 --> 29:20.297
They're going over it.

29:23.221 --> 29:25.553
The ME said this one
wasn't just strangled.

29:25.765 --> 29:27.005
Whoever did it used a garrote,

29:27.225 --> 29:29.056
which is a stick
that you put through the rope,

29:29.268 --> 29:30.929
and you just kind of keep twisting.

29:31.687 --> 29:32.676
Stiles?

29:35.441 --> 29:37.727
Oh, my God, did you know her?

29:37.944 --> 29:40.811
I'm so sorry. I didn't even think.

29:43.199 --> 29:44.439
I was...

29:47.203 --> 29:48.943
I was at her party.

29:50.498 --> 29:52.739
It was her birthday.

29:52.917 --> 29:54.578
Her name is Heather.

29:58.422 --> 30:02.165
Okay, we need to call your father,
'cause you're a witness.

30:15.398 --> 30:16.387
Stiles.

30:17.316 --> 30:19.693
- Ijust turned 17 today.
- Mmm.

30:19.902 --> 30:21.062
And you know what I want for my birthday?

30:21.279 --> 30:23.520
To not be a 17-year-old virgin.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.410
Has anyone else been through here tonight?

30:35.584 --> 30:38.792
Any other bodies, or even anybody missing?

30:38.963 --> 30:41.045
Uh, no, no bodies, but, um...

30:42.383 --> 30:43.793
- What?
- Two girls.

30:44.010 --> 30:46.626
They brought the first one in, Caitlin,
for a fox screen,

30:46.846 --> 30:50.009
and then I overheard that
her girlfriend, Emily, just disappeared.

30:50.224 --> 30:51.304
I mean, they were out in the woods and...

30:51.517 --> 30:53.223
Nobody's found her yet?

30:53.436 --> 30:54.596
I don't know.

30:54.812 --> 30:56.473
- Okay, first one.
- Caitlin.

30:56.647 --> 30:57.602
Is she here?

30:57.773 --> 30:59.149
- Is she here right now?
- I think so.

30:59.358 --> 31:01.974
- Okay, where?
- Okay, okay, wait. Just wait a minute.

31:02.153 --> 31:03.893
- I have to talkto her.
- Why?

31:04.989 --> 31:07.571
Because I think I know what's happening.

31:08.409 --> 31:11.321
The red doors,
someone has to get them open.

31:11.537 --> 31:13.243
Someone has to drive them inside.

31:13.456 --> 31:15.913
- I'll go.
- No. I'm faster.

32:06.050 --> 32:07.256
Come and get us.

33:16.120 --> 33:17.826
Did that actually just work?

33:19.999 --> 33:21.034
It worked.

33:41.979 --> 33:43.719
- What are you hearing?
- Heartbeats.

33:46.233 --> 33:47.393
Both of them?

33:49.195 --> 33:50.275
Actually,

33:53.157 --> 33:54.146
three of them.

34:18.224 --> 34:19.339
Hello?

34:21.268 --> 34:23.008
ls someone there?

34:37.993 --> 34:39.858
We weren't doing anything that bad.

34:40.079 --> 34:42.035
I mean,
I've camped out there plenty of times.

34:42.248 --> 34:43.613
Right, but why tonight?

34:44.124 --> 34:46.957
We wanted to be alone for one night.

34:47.127 --> 34:51.211
Emily lives with her mom,
and I have three roommates.

34:51.423 --> 34:53.755
Not exactly romantic settings, you know?

34:54.218 --> 34:56.675
How long have you two been together?

34:56.887 --> 34:58.843
Three months.

34:59.056 --> 35:01.297
And you wanted to make it romantic.

35:02.851 --> 35:05.888
Yeah, you know, because...

35:07.523 --> 35:09.764
Because it was her first time.

35:14.530 --> 35:16.896
They're gonna find her, right?

35:17.116 --> 35:18.322
Aren't they?

35:29.336 --> 35:31.167
What are you doing?

35:33.215 --> 35:34.830
Close the door behind me and keep it shut.

35:36.218 --> 35:38.595
You go in there alone,

35:38.804 --> 35:40.169
and you're either gonna kill them,

35:40.806 --> 35:42.307
or they kill you.

35:47.062 --> 35:48.518
That's why I'm going in alone.

37:54.231 --> 37:55.391
Scott?

38:02.197 --> 38:03.858
The sun's coming up.

38:05.617 --> 38:06.993
Scott!

38:07.202 --> 38:08.908
The sun's coming up!

38:33.771 --> 38:35.352
There's a teacher.

38:36.607 --> 38:37.687
I'll take care of her.

38:40.903 --> 38:42.109
Get them out of here.

39:53.392 --> 39:55.599
So Boyd and Cora
might not have killed anyone?

39:56.311 --> 39:57.596
You're gonna wish they did.

39:58.605 --> 39:59.640
Why?

40:01.191 --> 40:03.147
I'm not exactly sure yet.

40:05.112 --> 40:07.569
The other girl who was
out in the woods, Emily,

40:08.782 --> 40:09.942
eventually they're gonna find her.

40:12.202 --> 40:13.817
She's one of them.

40:15.080 --> 40:16.741
Emily, Heather,

40:17.583 --> 40:19.949
the guy Lydia found at the pool,

40:21.086 --> 40:22.917
all three were virgins.

40:41.023 --> 40:44.686
And they're all gonna
have the same three injuries,

40:45.110 --> 40:48.273
strangled, throat slashed,
head bashed in.

40:52.200 --> 40:54.532
It's called the threefold death.

40:54.745 --> 40:58.158
So if these aren't random killings,
then what are they?

41:05.589 --> 41:07.170
Human sacrifices.
