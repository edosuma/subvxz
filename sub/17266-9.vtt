OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

THERE'S DR. J.

06:39.033 --> 06:40.300
TELL HER
THAT WE'RE NOT LESBIANS?

06:40.367 --> 06:42.900
- YOU KNOW WHAT, IT MIGHT BE
GOOD JUST TO BE HONEST.

06:42.967 --> 06:44.333
YOU KNOW, JUST, LIKE,
RIP THE BAND-AID OFF.

06:44.400 --> 06:46.500

06:52.200 --> 06:53.734
WE'RE JUST
STRETCHING IT OUT AND--

06:53.800 --> 06:55.166
- DEEP LUNGES REALLY WORK.

06:55.233 --> 06:56.567
APPARENTLY PINK TRIED IT.

06:56.633 --> 06:57.967
SHOOK THE BABY
RIGHT OUT OF HER.

06:58.033 --> 06:58.934

07:10.734 --> 07:12.300
WHAT IS IT?
"NEW USES FOR OLD THINGS"?

07:12.367 --> 07:14.567
- OH, YEAH, THE BUNDT PAN
THAT'S USED AS A...

07:14.633 --> 07:15.867
- CORN HOLDER!

07:15.934 --> 07:17.467
OH, MY GOD!
DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED.

07:17.533 --> 07:21.500
WE USE THAT EVERY SUMMER AT
OUR BEACH HOUSE ON BLOCK ISLAND.

07:21.567 --> 07:24.033
- OH, COME ON! [laughs]

07:24.100 --> 07:27.233

07:47.000 --> 07:48.567
STANDARD COUPLES
AND ALSO LOVERS.

07:48.633 --> 07:51.533

OR A LOVER, THEN, TO ATTEND.

07:51.600 --> 07:52.667

07:52.734 --> 07:56.767

THAT VERY SHORT-ARMED MAN?

08:11.900 --> 08:13.834
- THAT'S OUR, UH, COUSIN--
- SPERM DONOR.

08:13.900 --> 08:16.233
- IT'S THE COUSIN
OF OUR SPERM DONOR.

08:16.300 --> 08:19.000
- YEAH, OUR SPERM DONOR
DIED IN A FIERY MOTORCYCLE...

08:19.066 --> 08:20.433
- CAR ACCIDENT.
HE WAS ACTUALLY IN THE SIDECAR.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.433
- COLLISION, UH-HUH.

08:21.500 --> 08:22.900
- SIDECAR?
- YEAH.

08:22.967 --> 08:25.333
AND THEN WE BECAME FRIENDS--
- GUYS, I ALMOST DIDN'T MAKE IT.

08:25.400 --> 08:26.600
- OH, THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE.
- OH.

08:26.667 --> 08:28.867
- WOW, WELL,
I WILL LET YOU GUYS CATCH UP.

08:28.934 --> 08:33.300
IT'S AMAZING WHAT YOUR COUSIN
DID FOR THESE TWO.

08:33.367 --> 08:36.333
I'M SORRY
FOR HIS UNTIMELY PASSING.

08:36.400 --> 08:37.800
- OKAY.

08:37.867 --> 08:38.900
- WAIT, WHAT HAPPENED
TO COUSIN TONY?

08:38.967 --> 08:40.066
- JUST SHUT UP, SHUT UP.
JUST SHUT UP.

08:40.133 --> 08:41.300
- TONY JOES IS DEAD?
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

08:41.367 --> 08:42.734
- SHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT UP.
- OH, MY GOD.

08:42.800 --> 08:44.867
- NO, NO, STOP.
- OH, MY GOD.

08:44.934 --> 08:45.867
OH, MY GOD.
- OH, MY GOD.

08:45.934 --> 08:48.066
both: OH, MY GOD.

08:48.133 --> 08:49.133
OH, MY GOD.

08:49.200 --> 08:50.567
- WE'RE JUST LUNGING IT OUT,

08:50.633 --> 08:51.700
PINK STYLE.
both: OH, MY GOD.

08:57.700 --> 08:59.000
- YOU'RE THE COUSIN
OF THE SPERM DONOR.

08:59.066 --> 09:00.467
HE DIED IN A FIERY CRASH.

09:00.533 --> 09:01.900
- BUT TONY JOES IS OKAY?

09:01.967 --> 09:03.567
- OH, MY GOD.
- YES, TONY JOES IS OKAY.

09:03.633 --> 09:04.934
- THANK GOD.
I LOVE THAT GUY.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.533
- YEAH. NO, I KNOW.
- WHY ARE WE DOING THIS AGAIN?

09:06.600 --> 09:07.734
- BECAUSE WE MESSED UP

09:07.800 --> 09:09.300
AND WE TOLD DR. J
THAT WE WERE LESBIANS,

09:09.367 --> 09:10.500
BUT WE CAN'T TELL HER
THAT IT'S A LIE

09:10.567 --> 09:11.633
BECAUSE THEN IT WOULD BE
REALLY WEIRD

09:11.700 --> 09:13.133
WHEN WE NEED HER
TO DELIVER THE BABY.

09:13.200 --> 09:14.867
- YEAH, PLUS,
SHE INVITED US TO BLOCK ISLAND,

09:14.934 --> 09:16.967
WHICH IS LIKE A DREAM OF MINE,
YOU KNOW THAT.

09:17.033 --> 09:18.900
- COME ON.
- I'M THE SPERM DONOR'S BROTHER.

09:18.967 --> 09:20.900
- OH, MY GOD, YOU'RE THE COUSIN.
YOU'RE THE COUSIN.

09:20.967 --> 09:23.333
- COUSIN. GOD DAMN IT!
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING RIGHT.

09:23.400 --> 09:24.867
I ALMOST MISSED THIS THING.

09:24.934 --> 09:27.066
IT'S THE ONE SEVEN-HOUR STRETCH
THAT I'M AT A CARNIVAL,

09:27.133 --> 09:28.400
YOU KNOW,
AND THEN YOU GO INTO LABOR.

09:28.467 --> 09:29.600
IT'S PERFECT.

09:29.667 --> 09:30.600
- WHAT WERE YOU DOING
AT A CARNIVAL

09:30.667 --> 09:33.900
FOR SEVEN HOURS, BRUCE?

09:36.667 --> 09:38.700
- 'CAUSE I WAS
WINNING YOU THIS.

09:38.767 --> 09:40.100
- WHAT IS THAT?

09:40.166 --> 09:44.166
- IT'S A DOLPHIN, MAGGIE.

09:44.233 --> 09:45.533
- WHY ARE YOU STARING AT ME
LIKE THAT?

09:45.600 --> 09:48.600
- IT'S A DOLPHIN.

09:48.667 --> 09:50.934
- I'M SORRY.
I'M NOT--I DON'T--

09:51.000 --> 09:52.667
I'M NOT FOLLOWING,
AND I DON'T--

09:52.734 --> 09:53.800
- REMEMBER?

09:53.867 --> 09:55.166
WE TOOK OUR HONEYMOON
IN KISSIMMEE.

09:55.233 --> 09:56.200
WE WANTED TO GO SWIMMING
WITH DOLPHINS...

09:56.266 --> 09:57.700
- MM-HMM, MM-HMM.

09:57.767 --> 09:59.900
- BUT WE COULDN'T BECAUSE THEY
ACCIDENTALLY MIXED IN A PORPOISE

09:59.967 --> 10:01.834
AND IT GOT REALLY AGGRESSIVE
WITH ONE OF THE TODDLERS AND...

10:01.900 --> 10:03.200
both: TOOK A TOE OFF.
- YEAH.

10:03.266 --> 10:04.667
- AND WE HAD TO SPEND
THE WHOLE DAY AT A DENNY'S,

10:04.734 --> 10:05.967
AND YOU WERE SO SAD.

10:06.033 --> 10:07.834
- YEAH, BECAUSE THE POOL
THAT WE WERE GONNA SWIM IN

10:07.900 --> 10:08.934
WAS FILLED WITH BLOOD.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.834
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT
TO REMIND ME OF?

10:10.900 --> 10:13.367
- NO, I WANTED TO SAY...

10:13.433 --> 10:15.900
HERE'S YOUR DOLPHIN.

10:15.967 --> 10:18.834
YOU CAN SWIM WITH IT NOW.

10:20.533 --> 10:22.600
YOU CAN SWIM WITH IT NOW.

10:23.667 --> 10:26.633
- [groaning]

10:26.700 --> 10:29.133
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?
WHY IS SHE STARING AT ME?

10:29.200 --> 10:30.333
- SHE'S HAVING A CONTRACTION.

10:30.400 --> 10:31.467
- THIS IS A CONTRACTION?
- OKAY, YES.

10:31.533 --> 10:33.333
- IT'S COMING RIGHT NOW.
I CAN GET IT.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.700
- NO, NO.
- CAN I HELP GET IT OUT?

10:34.767 --> 10:36.266
- NO, NO, NO, NO.
I DON'T NEED THIS.

10:36.333 --> 10:37.900
- OKAY, CAN EVERYONE GET OUT,
PLEASE?

10:37.967 --> 10:39.533
- HEY, I AM
YOUR EMOTIONAL LIAISON.

10:39.600 --> 10:41.667
- I DON'T KNOW.
- BRUCE, LET'S GO.

10:43.967 --> 10:45.800
HOW ARE YOU EATING
THAT JELL-O

10:45.867 --> 10:48.133
AND CRYING THIS HARD
AT THE SAME TIME?

10:48.200 --> 10:50.233
- I EAT ON AN INHALE.

10:50.300 --> 10:51.734
[coughs]

10:51.800 --> 10:52.834
OH, MY GOD.

10:52.900 --> 10:54.500
I JUST GOT JELL-O LODGED
IN MY TRACHEA.

10:54.567 --> 10:57.033
- YOU JUST CHOKED ON JELL-O?
- I JUST CHOKED ON JELL-O.

10:57.100 --> 10:58.233
- OKAY, WELL,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:58.300 --> 10:59.734
THIS ISN'T
IN THE DOULA HANDBOOK,

10:59.800 --> 11:01.934
BUT I'M GONNA SLAP YOU
ACROSS THE FACE.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.767
- DO YOU THINK IT'LL HELP?
- I DO.

11:03.834 --> 11:06.433
- HUH. OKAY.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.700
UH, SO MAYBE, LIKE,

11:08.767 --> 11:10.834
KIND OF COUNT ME IN,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

11:10.900 --> 11:14.700
LIKE A ONE--

11:14.767 --> 11:17.633
- ARE YOU DEAD?
- NO.

11:17.700 --> 11:18.934
THAT WAS REALLY GOOD.
- YEAH.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
- THAT FELT GREAT.
THAT FELT GREAT.

11:22.066 --> 11:23.467
- OKAY, YOU'RE WELCOME.

11:23.533 --> 11:26.433
NOW, WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:26.500 --> 11:27.767
- I DON'T WANT TO SCREW UP
BEING A DAD

11:27.834 --> 11:30.900
THE SAME WAY THAT I SCREWED UP
MY MARRIAGE.

11:30.967 --> 11:34.066
I DON'T WANT TO MESS UP
FOR THIS BABY

11:34.133 --> 11:35.200
'CAUSE I LOVE HER ALREADY,

11:35.266 --> 11:37.867
AND SHE'S NOT EVEN
OUT OF MAGGIE YET.

11:37.934 --> 11:40.533
- LOOK, BRUCE, YOU DID MESS UP
WITH MAGGIE, OKAY?

11:40.600 --> 11:42.200
BUT YOU HAVEN'T MESSED UP
WITH THIS BABY YET.

11:42.266 --> 11:43.867
YOU HAVE A CLEAN SLATE.

11:43.934 --> 11:45.433
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO PROVE

11:45.500 --> 11:47.066
THAT YOU ARE GONNA BE
A GOOD DAD.

11:47.133 --> 11:48.367
- I DO WANT TO PROVE IT.

11:48.433 --> 11:50.266
- GOOD, SO WHEN WE GO BACK
INTO THAT ROOM,

11:50.333 --> 11:51.567
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

11:51.633 --> 11:53.834
- I'M GONNA KEEP IT TOGETHER.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

11:53.900 --> 11:54.900
- I'M NOT EVEN GONNA MENTION

11:54.967 --> 11:56.133
THAT I ALMOST CHOKED
ON THIS JELL-O.

11:56.200 --> 11:57.400
- I WANT YOU
TO LITERALLY TELL HER NOTHING

11:57.467 --> 11:59.667
ABOUT YOURSELF, OKAY?
- OKAY.

11:59.734 --> 12:01.934
CAN YOU DO ME
ONE MORE FAVOR?

12:02.000 --> 12:02.934
CAN YOU HIT ME IN THE FACE
ONE MORE TIME?

12:03.000 --> 12:06.367
AAH!

12:06.433 --> 12:09.000
- ALL RIGHT, OKAY.
- [groaning]

12:09.066 --> 12:11.200
- I WANT YOU TO THINK
ABOUT THE COOL WAVES

12:11.266 --> 12:12.633
AT BLOCK ISLAND, OKAY?

12:12.700 --> 12:15.533
- OKAY, OKAY.
MY TOES ARE IN THE SAND.

12:15.600 --> 12:17.200
- YEAH, AND THERE'S DR. J,
AND--

12:17.266 --> 12:19.066
[gasps]
AND TERI'S JUST BROUGHT OUT

12:19.133 --> 12:20.567
SOME FRESH CLAMS
FOR A CLAM BAKE.

12:20.633 --> 12:23.166
- OH, MY GOD,
ON A HAND-PAINTED TRAY.

12:23.233 --> 12:24.567
- YEAH, MM-HMM.
- THANK YOU, TERI.

12:24.633 --> 12:26.934
- SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE, RIGHT?
- NO.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.867
- AND THEN THEY'RE PASSING OUT
CASHMERE PASHMINAS

12:29.934 --> 12:31.333
THAT WE CAN TAKE HOME.
- WHAT?

12:31.400 --> 12:33.433
THE TAKE-HOME IS CASHMERE?
- YEP.

12:33.500 --> 12:36.734
- OH, MY GOD, TERI!
- TERI!

12:36.800 --> 12:37.734
OH.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.200
OH, GOD.

12:39.266 --> 12:40.633
ALL RIGHT,
AND YOU'RE DONE.

12:40.700 --> 12:41.734
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

12:41.800 --> 12:45.400
LET ME GET YOU SOME WATER.
OKAY.

12:45.467 --> 12:46.934
- [sighs]
- THERE WE GO.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.834
- YOU THINK
THERE WILL REALLY BE CASHMERE?

12:48.900 --> 12:50.066
- OH, I KNOW THERE WILL.

12:50.133 --> 12:51.533
- IS NOW A GOOD TIME?

12:51.600 --> 12:53.000
- [sighs]
DO YOU HAVE IT TOGETHER?

12:53.066 --> 12:55.000
- HE'S GOT IT TOGETHER.
DOULA'S HONOR.

12:55.066 --> 12:57.300
- I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT--

12:57.367 --> 12:58.533
- OH, HERE WE GO.

12:58.600 --> 13:00.367
- OKAY, DON'T PROPOSE TO ME,
MAN.

13:00.433 --> 13:02.433
I CAN'T--
I CAN'T HANDLE IT RIGHT NOW.

13:02.500 --> 13:03.667
- NO, I'M NOT.

13:03.734 --> 13:05.500
THIS IS A PROPOSAL
FOR AN APOLOGY.

13:05.567 --> 13:07.600
- OKAY, JUST--
YOU CAN JUST APOLOGIZE.

13:07.667 --> 13:10.467
- OKAY, LOOK, I KNOW I REALLY
MESSED THINGS UP WITH YOU,

13:10.533 --> 13:13.333
AND I KNOW I CAN'T GO BACK
AND FIX IT.

13:13.400 --> 13:15.934
BUT I'M GONNA BE THERE 100%
FOR THIS LITTLE GIRL.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.367
WHATEVER SHE NEEDS, I'M GONNA BE
THE BEST DAD AROUND.

13:19.433 --> 13:22.200
- THANK YOU, BRUCE.
THAT'S--THAT MEANS A LOT.

13:22.266 --> 13:24.200
- NOW, IF ANYBODY NEEDS ME,
I'M GONNA BE IN THE CORNER

13:24.266 --> 13:26.600
BLOWING UP THIS PLASTIC DOLPHIN
WITH AIR FROM MY MOUTH.

13:26.667 --> 13:28.467
- ALL RIGHT, BUDDY.

13:28.533 --> 13:31.367
- OH.
[laughs] FULL HOUSE.

13:31.433 --> 13:32.333
- YEAH.

13:32.400 --> 13:33.600

13:33.667 --> 13:34.900
- OH, WELL, THIS IS, UM,
MAGGIE'S BROTHER ZACH.

13:34.967 --> 13:37.934

13:38.000 --> 13:40.500
SO IF YOU NEED SOMEBODY
TO TAG IN AT ANY POINT...

13:40.567 --> 13:43.900
[clicks tongue]

13:43.967 --> 13:45.100
- OKAY.
- I GOT IT.

13:45.166 --> 13:46.433
- THANK YOU.
HI, MAGGIE.

13:46.500 --> 13:48.533
- HI.
- HI. HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

13:48.600 --> 13:50.200
IS THE PAIN BEARABLE?

13:50.266 --> 13:51.700
- YEAH, I'M DOING GOOD.
- GOOD.

13:51.767 --> 13:54.133
- I THINK I'M GONNA STILL TRY TO
DO IT WITHOUT AN EPIDURAL, SO--

13:54.200 --> 13:56.333
- YEAH,
MAGGIE'S REALLY STRONG.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.567
I ALWAYS SAY SHE'S LIKE
AN OLD THOROUGHBRED MARE.

13:58.633 --> 14:00.567
- OW.
- YOU KNOW?

14:00.633 --> 14:02.500
THAT'S WHAT FIRST ATTRACTED ME
TO HER, HER STRENGTH.

14:02.567 --> 14:04.700
I REMEMBER
IN OUR COMMITMENT CEREMONY,

14:04.767 --> 14:07.834
I WAS A MESS,
BUT THIS OLD THOROUGHBRED--

14:07.900 --> 14:10.166
SHE WAS JUST STRONG
AS A ROCK.

14:10.233 --> 14:12.133
- WOW.
WHERE WAS IT?

14:12.200 --> 14:15.734
- OH, IN BOCA RATON.

14:15.800 --> 14:18.233
UM, I WAS WEARING
A TANKINI TWO-PIECE,

14:18.300 --> 14:22.867
AND YOU WERE IN A SLEEVELESS
WHITE TUXEDO TOP, RIGHT?

14:22.934 --> 14:24.100
WITH, UH...
- YEAH, MM-HMM.

14:24.166 --> 14:25.400
- SOME CAPRI PANTS.

14:25.467 --> 14:26.633
- YES.

14:26.700 --> 14:29.266
THEY WERE BY, UM--
WHAT WAS THE DESIGNER?

14:29.333 --> 14:31.233
- HUGO, UH--
- HUGO BOSS.

14:31.300 --> 14:32.367
- YEP.
- YEAH.

14:32.433 --> 14:34.200
I ALWAYS LOVE
THE CUT OF HIS SUITS--

14:34.266 --> 14:35.667
OH!
- OKAY.

14:35.734 --> 14:36.633
- HERE IT COMES.
- OKAY.

14:36.700 --> 14:37.800
- OKAY, YOU NEED SOMETHING?

14:37.867 --> 14:39.333
- [groans] THAT PILLOW.
THAT WEIRD PILLOW.

14:39.400 --> 14:41.100
- PILLOW--ZACH, ZACH,
CAN YOU GET THE PILLOW?

14:41.166 --> 14:42.600
- IT'S NOT IN HERE.
- ZACH, COME ON, MAN.

14:42.667 --> 14:43.800
- GRAB THE PILLOW!

14:43.867 --> 14:44.934
- IT'S A PILLOW,
AND IT LOOKS LIKE A MOTH.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.400
- KEEP BREATHING.
- USE THE DOLPHIN!

14:46.467 --> 14:47.400
USE THE DOLPHIN!

14:47.467 --> 14:48.967
- QUIET.
- USE THE DOLPHIN.

14:49.033 --> 14:50.266
- FOCUS PLEASE.
- OH, GOD.

14:50.333 --> 14:51.600
DON'T PRESS DOWN, MAN!

14:51.667 --> 14:52.667
- SHH, SHH, KEEP BREATHING.
- WHAT IS THIS?

14:52.734 --> 14:54.033
WHAT IS THIS?
NOBODY WANTS THAT.

14:54.100 --> 14:56.033
NOBODY WANTS THAT.
OH, MY GOD.

14:56.100 --> 14:58.266
WAIT, GET YOUR HEAD OUT
FROM BETWEEN HER LEGS!

14:58.333 --> 14:59.367
THAT IS SO WEIRD OF YOU.

14:59.433 --> 15:00.633
- I THINK
THERE'S A HOLE IN THERE.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.400
- OH, GOD. OKAY.
- GET THE DOLPHIN AWAY FROM ME!

15:02.467 --> 15:04.333
- I'M TRYING TO DO THIS
FOR MY BABY, ALL RIGHT?

15:04.400 --> 15:05.900
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
IT'S OUR CHILD,

15:05.967 --> 15:08.467
BECAUSE YOU ARE THE COUSIN
OF THE SPERM DONOR--

15:08.533 --> 15:10.000
- OF COURSE I RECALL.
IT'S MY COUSIN.

15:10.066 --> 15:11.767
- NO, NO, NO, NO.
[overlapping shouting]

15:11.834 --> 15:13.266
SHUT UP FOR A SECOND!

15:13.333 --> 15:15.467
EVERYBODY JUST BE QUIET.

15:15.533 --> 15:17.367
IN THIS MOMENT--
IN THIS MOMENT,

15:17.433 --> 15:20.233
I'M GONNA TELL THE TRUTH.

15:20.300 --> 15:21.800
OKAY, HE'S NOT THE COUSIN
OF THE SPERM DONOR.

15:21.867 --> 15:23.066
HE'S THE DAD.

15:23.133 --> 15:25.033
AND THIS IS MY BEST FRIEND,

15:25.100 --> 15:26.900
AND THIS IS MY BROTHER,
AND YOU'RE DR. J.

15:26.967 --> 15:29.967
AND I'M HAVING A CONTRACTION,
AND THEN I'M GONNA HAVE A BABY.

15:30.033 --> 15:33.100
- OKAY, I-I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.567
- WE'RE REALLY SORRY, DR. J.

15:34.633 --> 15:36.600
WE LET YOU BELIEVE
WE WERE LESBIANS

15:36.667 --> 15:38.567
BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST
SUCH A GOOD DOCTOR AND--

15:38.633 --> 15:39.834
- WE DIDN'T WANT
TO MAKE IT WEIRD,

15:39.900 --> 15:41.433
BUT WE MADE IT WEIRD ANYWAY.

15:41.500 --> 15:43.467
- YEAH, AND WE JUST WANTED YOU
TO LIKE US.

15:43.533 --> 15:45.967
SO, UM, I AM ACTUALLY
THE BEST FRIEND.

15:46.033 --> 15:47.233
I DROPPED EVERYTHING,

15:47.300 --> 15:48.567
AND I MOVED IN TO HELP HER
WITH THE BABY.

15:48.633 --> 15:49.633
- OKAY.

15:49.700 --> 15:52.934
FOR THE RECORD,
THIS A LITTLE LESBIAN-Y.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.467
- [sighs]

16:02.800 --> 16:03.967
- [moaning]
- OKAY, OKAY.

16:04.033 --> 16:06.967
I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW.
- OH, IT HURTS.

16:07.033 --> 16:08.133
OH, GOD!
-WHERE IS RAMONA?

16:08.200 --> 16:09.600
I CALLED HER, LIKE,
FIVE MINUTES AGO!

16:09.667 --> 16:11.100
OKAY, ZACH, CAN YOU GET ME
THE WARM RICE THING

16:11.166 --> 16:12.367
IN THE SOCK, PLEASE?

16:12.433 --> 16:15.033
- EMMA, I DON'T--I DON'T
THINK I CAN DO THIS.

16:15.100 --> 16:16.800
- NO, YOU'RE DOING SO GREAT.
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

16:16.867 --> 16:18.734
- OKAY, BUT I THINK
I MIGHT NEED AN EPIDURAL.

16:18.800 --> 16:20.600
I KNOW I SAID I DIDN'T WANT ONE.
IS IT BAD?

16:20.667 --> 16:22.133
- YOU ARE GONNA HAVE
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

16:22.200 --> 16:23.800
I DON'T CARE. I'LL GO SHIRLEY
MACLAINE ON THESE PEOPLE.

16:23.867 --> 16:25.500
- SHIRLEY MACLAINE
FROM STEEL MAGNOLIAS?

16:25.567 --> 16:27.133
- NO, NO, NO.
TERMS OF ENDEARMENT, HONEY.

16:27.200 --> 16:28.533
TERMS OF ENDEARMENT.
- OKAY, THANK YOU!

16:28.600 --> 16:30.133
- HOW ARE WE DOING?

16:30.200 --> 16:31.633
- I'M IN A LOT OF PAIN,
AND I'M HURTING.

16:31.700 --> 16:33.734
- I KNOW. THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU'RE ALMOST CLOSE, HONEY.

16:33.800 --> 16:36.066
I'M GONNA GO WASH UP,
BUT YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

16:36.133 --> 16:37.333
- DR. J, CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

16:37.400 --> 16:39.867
ZACH, ZACH--
I'M GONNA BE RIGHT BACK.

16:39.934 --> 16:41.066
OKAY, I'M GONNA BE RIGHT BACK.

16:41.133 --> 16:42.834
- [moaning]

16:42.900 --> 16:45.100
- OKAY, I KNOW WE SAID WE DIDN'T
WANT AN EPIDURAL,

16:45.166 --> 16:46.667
BUT WE ACTUALLY HAVE
CHANGED OUR MIND.

16:46.734 --> 16:47.667
- OH, WELL,
IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT.

16:47.734 --> 16:48.767
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

16:48.834 --> 16:49.767
- SHE'S ABOUT
TO START PUSHING.

16:49.834 --> 16:51.000
THERE'S NO TIME.

16:51.066 --> 16:52.567
- NO, NO, NO. SOMEBODY
SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME THAT

16:52.633 --> 16:53.800
BECAUSE WE NEED TO FIGURE
SOMETHING OUT, THEN.

16:53.867 --> 16:55.333
BECAUSE SHE IS
IN A LOT OF PAIN RIGHT NOW.

16:55.400 --> 16:57.500
SO WHAT I NEED YOU TO DO IS GO
GET AN ANESTHESIOLOGIST, OKAY?

16:57.567 --> 16:59.033
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

16:59.100 --> 17:00.734
- I'M GOING TO REMIND YOU
THAT YOU'RE HER BEST FRIEND,

17:00.800 --> 17:01.834
AND I AM HER DOCTOR.

17:01.900 --> 17:02.800
AND IT'S NOT ADVISABLE
RIGHT NOW.

17:02.867 --> 17:04.266
THAT BABY IS TOO FAR DOWN.

17:04.333 --> 17:06.133
IF YOU WANT MOM AND BABY
TO BE HEALTHY,

17:06.200 --> 17:07.633
WE CANNOT HAVE AN EPIDURAL.

17:07.700 --> 17:08.700
- I KNOW,
BUT I PROMISED HER

17:08.767 --> 17:09.867
THAT I WOULD GET HER
AN EPIDURAL.

17:09.934 --> 17:10.967
SHE NEEDS AN EPIDURAL.

17:11.033 --> 17:13.967
- THE ONLY THING
SHE NEEDS RIGHT NOW...

17:14.033 --> 17:15.300
IS YOU.

17:17.033 --> 17:18.266
I'M GONNA GO GET SUITED UP.

17:18.333 --> 17:19.200
I'LL MEET YOU IN THERE.

17:19.266 --> 17:22.100
WE'RE ABOUT TO HAVE A BABY.

17:22.166 --> 17:24.400
- OKAY.

17:24.467 --> 17:25.266
[exhales]

17:25.333 --> 17:26.967
SHIRLEY MACLAINE.

17:27.033 --> 17:28.667
AHEM!

17:28.734 --> 17:30.967
- AAAAHHHH!

17:31.033 --> 17:32.200
- I CAN SEE THE HEAD!

17:32.266 --> 17:33.867
SHE'S GOT ALL THIS HAIR.
IT'S GORGEOUS!

17:33.934 --> 17:35.633
OKAY, THIS IS VERY EXCITING.
THIS IS VERY EXCITING.

17:35.700 --> 17:37.700
- MAGGIE, JUST A COUPLE MORE
GOOD PUSHES LIKE THAT.

17:37.767 --> 17:39.000
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

17:39.066 --> 17:40.400
- OKAY, BUT I'M TIRED.
I'M SO, SO TIRED.

17:40.467 --> 17:41.367
- I KNOW, BUT YOU'RE
DOING SO GOOD.

17:41.433 --> 17:42.433
YOU'RE DOING SO GOOD, OKAY?

17:42.500 --> 17:44.066
- CAN SHE JUST MAYBE
TAKE IT OUT

17:44.133 --> 17:46.734
AND THEN I'LL SEE YOU
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT?

17:46.800 --> 17:48.867
'CAUSE I'M JUST, LIKE,
REAL TIRED

17:48.934 --> 17:50.166
IS WHAT IS HAPPENING.

17:50.233 --> 17:51.600
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE'RE ALMOST DONE.

17:51.667 --> 17:53.233
- ALSO, IT HURTS
IS WHAT IT DOES, IS IT HURTS.

17:53.300 --> 17:54.333
- WE'RE ALMOST DONE.

17:54.400 --> 17:56.233
SO CAN YOU JUST GIVE ME
ONE MORE PUSH?

17:56.300 --> 17:58.433
- NO, I CAN'T. I CAN'T.

17:58.500 --> 17:59.767
- NO, NO! MAGGIE?

17:59.834 --> 18:00.900
- CAN'T DO IT.

18:00.967 --> 18:03.533
- OKAY.

18:03.600 --> 18:04.700
OKAY.

18:04.767 --> 18:06.734
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN TO ME.
LISTEN TO ME.

18:06.800 --> 18:08.767
I'M GONNA GET REAL DARK
WITH YOU FOR JUST ONE SECOND.

18:08.834 --> 18:10.333
BUT I PROMISE YOU,
IT WILL HAVE A GOOD ENDING.

18:10.400 --> 18:11.400
ALL RIGHT, DO
YOU REMEMBER THE MORNING

18:11.467 --> 18:12.367
OF YOUR PARENTS' FUNERAL?

18:12.433 --> 18:14.033
- WHAT?
- STAY WITH ME.

18:14.100 --> 18:16.834
WHEN WE GOT TO THE CHAPEL
YOU SAID, "I CAN'T DO IT.

18:16.900 --> 18:18.467
I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE TO THEM."

18:18.533 --> 18:19.333
- [crying]

18:19.400 --> 18:22.233
- AND I SAID, "YES, YOU CAN.

18:22.300 --> 18:24.367
YES YOU CAN, BECAUSE I'M GONNA
BE RIGHT HERE WITH YOU."

18:24.433 --> 18:26.600
- OKAY.
- SO YOU LEANED ON MY SHOULDER

18:26.667 --> 18:27.867
AND YOU WALKED
DOWN THAT AISLE.

18:27.934 --> 18:30.233
OKAY, WELL, GUESS
WHO'S HERE RIGHT NOW.

18:30.300 --> 18:31.233
YOUR MOM.

18:31.300 --> 18:32.667
- [crying]

18:32.734 --> 18:35.667
- SHE'S HERE.
SHE'S HERE, MAGS, YES.

18:35.734 --> 18:37.900
AND SHE'S WEARING
THAT WEIRD HOUSECOAT

18:37.967 --> 18:39.433
SHE USED TO WEAR
AT HIGH SCHOOL

18:39.500 --> 18:41.934
THAT WE TRIED TO THROW OUT
SO MANY TIMES.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.266
- OH, THAT WAS UGLY.

18:43.333 --> 18:44.633
- SO YOU KNOW
WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO?

18:44.700 --> 18:46.400
I WANT YOU TO GRAB MY HAND.

18:46.467 --> 18:48.333
AND I WANT YOU
TO GRAB HER HAND.

18:48.400 --> 18:49.900
AND I WANT YOU TO PUSH THAT BABY
RIGHT OUT OF YOU.

18:49.967 --> 18:51.000
- OKAY.

18:51.066 --> 18:52.900
- OKAY? I LOVE YOU.
LET'S DO THIS!

18:52.967 --> 18:54.166
- OKAY.
- LET'S DO THIS!

18:54.233 --> 18:55.266
- LET'S DO IT!
- LET'S HAVE A BABY, OKAY?

18:55.333 --> 18:56.667
COME ON!

18:56.734 --> 18:58.533
- IT'S COMING, IT'S COMING,
IT'S COMING.

18:58.600 --> 19:00.233
OKAY, OKAY.
- OKAY.

19:00.300 --> 19:04.066
- [screaming]

19:04.133 --> 19:05.200
- HOLD THAT PUSH,
HOLD IT.

19:05.266 --> 19:06.166
HOLD IT.

19:06.233 --> 19:07.867
- [screaming]
- I CAN SEE IT!

19:07.934 --> 19:09.633
- [screaming]

19:09.700 --> 19:11.300
- [baby cries]

19:11.367 --> 19:13.834
- YOU HAVE
A BEAUTIFUL BABY GIRL.

19:13.900 --> 19:15.000
- [baby cries]

19:15.066 --> 19:17.633
- OH, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD!
OH, MY GOD!

19:17.700 --> 19:20.633
OH, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD!

19:20.700 --> 19:21.834
- [baby cries]

19:21.900 --> 19:24.934
- I'M SORRY! I'M SORRY.
DID WE WAKE YOU?

19:25.033 --> 19:26.300
[laughs]

19:26.367 --> 19:28.567
- [baby cries]

19:33.467 --> 19:35.033
- HEY! OH, GOD, HOW IS SHE?

19:35.100 --> 19:36.133
IS SHE GOOD?
ARE THEY GOOD?

19:36.200 --> 19:37.433
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

19:37.500 --> 19:39.900
SHE PUSHED IT OUT OF HER.
SHE WAS PHENOMENAL.

19:39.967 --> 19:42.800
I MEAN, HONESTLY, SHE IS THE
STRONGEST PERSON IN THE WORLD.

19:42.867 --> 19:44.233
WHERE IS TINA?
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

19:44.300 --> 19:46.066
- OH, YEAH, IT'S OKAY.
IT'S FINE.

19:46.133 --> 19:48.066
NO, SHE'S, UM--
SHE WENT TO HER MOM'S.

19:48.133 --> 19:50.133
SHE, UH, SHE NEEDS
A COUPLE OF DAYS TO COOL OFF.

19:50.200 --> 19:51.333
WHAT'S HER NAME?

19:51.400 --> 19:53.066
- CHARLOTTE,
AFTER MAGGIE'S MOM.

19:53.133 --> 19:54.867
AND--OH, MY GOD, MARK--
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

19:54.934 --> 19:56.800
SHE IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING
YOU'VE EVER SEEN.

19:56.867 --> 19:58.100
SHE HAS THESE BIG BLUE EYES.

19:58.166 --> 19:59.967
AND SHE CAME OUT,
AND IT WAS JUST LIKE,

20:00.033 --> 20:01.433
"RAWWRR! I'M HERE!"

20:01.500 --> 20:04.000
YOU KNOW? I MEAN, SHE'S PROBABLY
A BABY GENIUS.

20:04.066 --> 20:05.867
BUT WE'RE GONNA ENCOURAGE HER
TO BE WHATEVER SHE WANTS.

20:05.934 --> 20:08.000
YOU KNOW, LIKE A SENATOR
OR A COSMONAUT OR--

20:08.066 --> 20:09.400
I MEAN, IF SHE WANTS TO WORK
AT CLAIRE'S BOUTIQUE,

20:09.467 --> 20:12.300
THAT'S OKAY WITH US,
JUST AS LONG AS SHE'S HAPPY.

20:12.367 --> 20:13.533
- YOU KNOW WHAT, I DON'T--

20:13.600 --> 20:15.934
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER
SEEN YOU THIS HAPPY.

20:16.000 --> 20:16.967
HA HA!

20:17.033 --> 20:18.133
I BOUGHT YOU
SOME OF THIS, UH,

20:18.200 --> 20:19.500
JUNK FOOD STUFF
THAT YOU LIKE

20:19.567 --> 20:21.400
JUST BECAUSE I FIGURED
YOU NEEDED A LITTLE SUSTENANCE.

20:21.467 --> 20:22.667
- OH, PLEASE,
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
