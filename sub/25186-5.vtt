00:16.000 --> 00:20.960
Previously on Love Island...

00:22.960 --> 00:24.960
..there were reconciliations.

00:25.960 --> 00:29.480
<font color="#FFFF00">I haven't given you a chance. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Can we</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">give it a little bit  of a chance?</font>

00:29.960 --> 00:31.960
<font color="#FFFF00">OK, we will give it a chance.</font>

00:31.960 --> 00:33.960
And relationships hit the rocks.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm going to wait until I get what</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I want from it.</font>

00:37.960 --> 00:39.960
<font color="#FFFF00">That is all I needed to hear.</font>

00:39.960 --> 00:44.320
<font color="#11FF11">You are so scared to, like, let us</font>
<font color="#11FF11">in,  that you are, like, trying to</font>
<font color="#11FF11">push us away.</font>

00:51.960 --> 00:53.960
Tonight...

00:56.960 --> 01:00.960
..the recoupling is looming.

01:00.960 --> 01:03.480
<font color="#FFFF00">Tonight there will be a re-coupling.</font>

01:03.640 --> 01:06.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, my... Oh, my God.</font>

01:06.960 --> 01:10.960
<font color="#11FF11">Maybe I do need to get to know you</font>
<font color="#11FF11">just as much  as I've got to know</font>
<font color="#11FF11">everyone else.</font>

01:10.960 --> 01:13.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I do still like you.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">It is going to be a hard decision.</font>

01:13.960 --> 01:16.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I really don't know what I'm going</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to do. I'm in two minds.</font>

01:33.960 --> 01:37.960
It's night time in paradise,
and having made up with Dani,

01:37.960 --> 01:41.960
Jack's about to enjoy a bit
of red-hot action in his bed.

01:41.960 --> 01:45.960
With Eyal. Had you worried there,
Danny Dyer, didn't I?!

01:46.000 --> 01:48.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Mate, honestly, I'm over the moon,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">mate.</font>

01:48.960 --> 01:50.960
The girls are getting ready.

01:50.960 --> 01:52.960
Hayley's borrowed Georgia's
foundation,

01:52.960 --> 01:54.960
Laura's borrowed Dani's lippy,

01:54.960 --> 01:57.960
and Rosie's borrowed a tail
from the farmer's horse.

01:57.960 --> 02:01.960
<font color="#FFFF00">The boys must get so bored</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">when we're getting ready.</font>

02:01.960 --> 02:04.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah, what do they do?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I think a few of them nap, you know?</font>

02:04.960 --> 02:06.960
<font color="#11FF11">Look at all those chickens!</font>

02:15.960 --> 02:18.960
They scrub up nice, this lot,
don't they?

02:19.960 --> 02:22.960
Outside, Niall and Georgia
are having a little chat.

02:22.960 --> 02:27.800
Sorry to interrupt, guys, but I was
wondering what is your favourite
Basement Jaxx song?

02:27.960 --> 02:30.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Where's your head at?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Well, you. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> OK (!)</font>

02:30.960 --> 02:32.960
<font color="#FFFF00">You know it is.</font>

02:32.960 --> 02:36.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Like, do you know what I mean? With</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you, I can talk to you easily,  and</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">not like...</font>

02:37.000 --> 02:40.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah, I'm your mate now as well,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">babe. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Are you friend zoning me? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> No!</font>

02:40.960 --> 02:45.960
<font color="#00FFFF">As long as you are always honest</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to me and I'm always honest to you,</font>

02:45.960 --> 02:48.960
<font color="#00FFFF">then...our ship is sailing fine.</font>

02:48.960 --> 02:53.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I think that, too. I think it is.</font>

02:53.960 --> 02:55.960
<font color="#00FFFF">That's nice.</font>

02:55.960 --> 02:59.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Wait. No. Are you gonna pie it?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I thought that was a good moment.</font>

03:04.960 --> 03:08.000
<font color="#00FFFF">Don't, you dick!</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">You are such an idiot.</font>

03:08.160 --> 03:11.960
<font color="#00FFFF">You are doing my head in already.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm joking.</font>

03:11.960 --> 03:13.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Georgia's on a level,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">that's all I wanted!</font>

03:13.960 --> 03:18.480
<font color="#00FFFF">A girl to come in, embrace it</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and just be a laugh. OH!</font>

03:18.640 --> 03:22.320
<font color="#00FFFF">She is so fit as well!</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">It is brilliant!</font>

03:22.480 --> 03:26.960
Earlier today, Hayley and Dani
hatched a plan to swap their other
halves.

03:26.960 --> 03:28.960
I went to a dinner party
like that one time.

03:28.960 --> 03:30.960
Never did get my car keys back.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.960
<font color="#FFFF00">HAYLEY: We had that conversation</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and then we played Truth or Dare.</font>

03:34.960 --> 03:40.960
<font color="#FFFF00">And then I was thinking, "I'm with</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Eyal.  I don't see myself going any</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">further  with him than a friend."</font>

03:40.960 --> 03:44.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Well, if I'm not happy with Eyal,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the only other safe option is Jack!</font>

03:44.960 --> 03:47.640
<font color="#FFFF00">Do you know what I mean?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I thought, well, right now</font>

03:47.800 --> 03:50.000
<font color="#FFFF00">no one is in here I am feeling</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">physically attracted to.</font>

03:50.160 --> 03:52.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I will pair up with him</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">in the re-coupling,</font>

03:52.960 --> 03:55.960
<font color="#FFFF00">and then hopefully</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I have an opportunity</font>

03:55.960 --> 03:59.160
<font color="#FFFF00">to find what I want in a man,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">do you know what I mean?</font>

03:59.320 --> 04:01.960
<font color="#FFFF00">But then, obviously, I noticed you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">got upset.</font>

04:01.960 --> 04:04.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't know what you've been upset</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">over, what happened?</font>

04:04.960 --> 04:06.960
<font color="#00FFFF">It wasn't about you</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">or anything like that.</font>

04:06.960 --> 04:09.960
<font color="#00FFFF">We wanted to give it a chance and</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">see what happens,</font>

04:09.960 --> 04:12.960
<font color="#00FFFF">get to know each other a bit more.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">OK, yes, cool.</font>

04:12.960 --> 04:15.640
<font color="#00FFFF">I do not want you to think</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm going back on my word.</font>

04:15.800 --> 04:19.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I want to see what happens.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">You've tried.</font>

04:19.959 --> 04:22.960
<font color="#FFFF00">If you have got a spark with him,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">then obviously, Dan,</font>

04:22.960 --> 04:27.480
<font color="#FFFF00">you are very lucky because not many</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">people have that spark so soon.</font>

04:27.640 --> 04:29.960
<font color="#FFFF00">If she genuinely feels</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">those feelings</font>

04:29.960 --> 04:32.960
<font color="#FFFF00">and feels like she's being genuine</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to herself, then yes,</font>

04:32.960 --> 04:36.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I believe she should give it a go.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Like, why not?</font>

04:36.960 --> 04:39.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm just going to get to know</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">everyone at the same level.</font>

04:39.960 --> 04:42.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I feel like I need to speak to Eyal</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and just say like,</font>

04:42.960 --> 04:45.960
<font color="#FFFF00">"If you have a spark with</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">any of these girls, crack on."</font>

04:46.000 --> 04:48.960
<font color="#FFFF00">But maybe I haven't</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">shown some interest.</font>

04:48.960 --> 04:50.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I think he does genuinely</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">like you, though.</font>

04:50.960 --> 04:53.960
<font color="#00FFFF">At least you are saying his name</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">right now.</font>

04:53.960 --> 04:59.000
<font color="#FFFF00">Right now, it is only Laura and Dani</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that know they're really safe ones</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">when it comes to re-coupling.</font>

04:59.160 --> 05:01.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I think the rest of the girls,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">they are vulnerable,</font>

05:01.960 --> 05:04.960
<font color="#FFFF00">but you do not know</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">what will happen, do you?</font>

05:04.960 --> 05:07.800
<font color="#FFFF00">Like, you've just got to wait</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and see, I suppose.</font>

05:07.960 --> 05:11.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Do you know what? I actually feel</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">being in here is making me a bit</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">wiser. I genuinely do.</font>

05:15.800 --> 05:17.960
After the ups and downs
of the last few days,

05:17.960 --> 05:20.960
Adam's taken Kendall aside
for a heart-to-heart.

05:20.960 --> 05:25.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I do not want to be a dick saying</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">this,  but I think, like, the way</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">things have panned out,</font>

05:25.960 --> 05:27.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I don't really know</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">what I can do more.</font>

05:27.960 --> 05:31.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Like, I gave you space</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">when you needed space.</font>

05:31.960 --> 05:36.480
<font color="#00FFFF">Like, it took, like, a lot to, like,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">couple up and, like,  actually pick</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you anyway.</font>

05:36.960 --> 05:41.960
<font color="#00FFFF">And, like, I've gave you, like,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">a lot more, like,</font>

05:41.960 --> 05:43.960
<font color="#00FFFF">and not really seen anything back.</font>

05:43.960 --> 05:46.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I've reassured you, like...</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">like, a lot.</font>

05:48.960 --> 05:53.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Then what makes you think</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that I've thought the opposite?</font>

05:53.960 --> 05:56.480
<font color="#00FFFF">Well, because,  Truth or Dare</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">today...</font>

05:56.640 --> 05:59.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, but that's because</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you ignored me all morning.</font>

05:59.960 --> 06:03.960
<font color="#FFFF00">So, like, going off my gut instinct,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">obviously I'm going to think that.</font>

06:03.960 --> 06:08.960
<font color="#FFFF00">And, like, Rosie kissed you and</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you said you found her attractive.</font>

06:08.960 --> 06:11.960
<font color="#FFFF00">A girl knows when a girl knows.</font>

06:11.960 --> 06:16.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Like, I said, like, I wasn't gonna</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">rush  just because two new girls are</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">in here.</font>

06:16.960 --> 06:21.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I think there's been a few things</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and it's probably better we're just</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">friends.</font>

06:21.960 --> 06:24.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I just don't really see us</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">going, like, any further.</font>

06:24.960 --> 06:28.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I feel I've tried a lot.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm not, like... like,</font>

06:28.960 --> 06:34.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I don't want to upset you, but I'd</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">rather nip it in the bud now  before</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">it goes further.</font>

06:36.160 --> 06:38.160
<font color="#FFFF00">OK.</font>

06:44.960 --> 06:47.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Well, that's my issue then.</font>

06:50.960 --> 06:52.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Like, you're a good-looking lad.</font>

06:52.960 --> 06:57.480
<font color="#FFFF00">Like, obviously, the girls that walk</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">in are going to want to pick you.</font>

06:57.640 --> 07:02.960
<font color="#00FFFF">But I've not shown you any reason</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">why I wouldn't jump from who I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">fancy the most.</font>

07:02.960 --> 07:04.960
<font color="#00FFFF">It would still be you right now.</font>

07:04.960 --> 07:07.960
<font color="#00FFFF">But it's ran its course now.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">It's done.</font>

07:07.960 --> 07:09.960
<font color="#FFFF00">OK.</font>

07:09.960 --> 07:15.000
<font color="#FFFF00">It's fine. That's fine.</font>

07:17.960 --> 07:23.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I've come in here to find someone</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and I don't...</font>

07:23.960 --> 07:32.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't just want to, like, make an</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">effort with people  for the sake of</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">it.</font>

07:32.960 --> 07:35.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Like, just because</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Adam's pied me now,</font>

07:35.960 --> 07:38.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm not gonna</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">jump on anyone else, like...</font>

07:38.960 --> 07:42.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I was into Adam.  (SNIFFLES)</font>

07:50.960 --> 07:55.960
<font color="#00FFFF">She was a little bit upset, which I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">did genuinely  feel a little bit</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">sorry about.</font>

07:55.960 --> 07:59.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Because I don't want</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to upset anyone.</font>

07:59.960 --> 08:01.960
<font color="#00FFFF">You have got to do</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">what you've got to do.</font>

08:01.960 --> 08:03.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm gonna look after myself.</font>

08:03.960 --> 08:05.960
<font color="#00FFFF">That's good timing!</font>
<font color="#11FF11">What?</font>

08:05.960 --> 08:07.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Do you want to go over there?</font>

08:07.960 --> 08:11.960
<font color="#11FF11">EYAL: You OK? </font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, are you?</font>

08:11.960 --> 08:18.960
<font color="#00FFFF">That was really good timing. You OK?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Yeah, are you?</font>

08:18.960 --> 08:20.960
<font color="#11FF11">What's going on?</font>

08:21.960 --> 08:24.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I just had a bit of a chat with</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Kendall. </font><font color="#11FF11"> About?</font>

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
<font color="#00FFFF">I just nipped it in the bud.</font>

08:27.160 --> 08:29.160
<font color="#11FF11">Where is your head at now?</font>

08:29.320 --> 08:32.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Mine? Where do you think?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I don't know.</font>

08:32.960 --> 08:35.960
<font color="#11FF11">I literally haven't spoken to you</font>
<font color="#11FF11">on your own at all.</font>

08:35.960 --> 08:37.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I know, this is the thing, isn't it?</font>

08:37.960 --> 08:40.960
<font color="#11FF11">I sorta made it clear</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I'm interested,</font>

08:40.960 --> 08:44.159
<font color="#11FF11">but I feel a bit awkward,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">so I just left you to it.</font>

08:44.320 --> 08:49.000
<font color="#11FF11">I was really nervous because Kendall</font>
<font color="#11FF11">is obviously around and she's nice</font>

08:49.160 --> 08:51.160
<font color="#11FF11">and I didn't want to upset her.</font>

08:51.320 --> 08:53.320
<font color="#11FF11">She is a nice girl, obviously.</font>

08:53.480 --> 08:57.960
<font color="#11FF11">But then, I wasn't going to just</font>
<font color="#11FF11">not say I didn't like you either.</font>

08:57.960 --> 09:00.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Bloody hell.</font>
What's going on?

09:01.000 --> 09:04.160
<font color="#00FFFF">He just asked if we could, like,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">go for a chat.</font>

09:04.320 --> 09:08.960
<font color="#00FFFF">He basically just said, like,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">"Let's call it a day."</font>

09:08.960 --> 09:10.960
<font color="#11FF11">He said that?</font>

09:10.960 --> 09:13.160
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah. I get where he's coming from.</font>

09:13.320 --> 09:19.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Like, I don't expect him to be here</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and, like, wait a week or two weeks</font>

09:19.960 --> 09:24.960
<font color="#00FFFF">when he has got someone that is,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">like, proper, like, gonna...</font>

09:24.960 --> 09:28.960
<font color="#11FF11">You know, he's not holding out</font>
<font color="#11FF11">for some weird reason.</font>

09:28.960 --> 09:31.960
<font color="#11FF11">Even though he said</font>
<font color="#11FF11">that he kind of would.</font>

09:31.960 --> 09:36.960
<font color="#11FF11">He is thinking about his place here</font>
<font color="#11FF11">as well, isn't he?</font>

09:36.960 --> 09:40.960
<font color="#11FF11">She is going to give him guarantee.</font>

09:40.960 --> 09:43.960
<font color="#00FFFF">How was your kiss in Truth or Dare?</font>

09:43.960 --> 09:46.960
<font color="#11FF11">Nice, yeah. How was it for you?</font>

09:46.960 --> 09:49.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I can't really remember.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">You remember?</font>

09:49.960 --> 09:53.960
<font color="#00FFFF">No. Need to do it again.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Try it again?</font>

09:55.960 --> 09:58.640
<font color="#FFFF00">Oi. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> What?</font>

10:01.960 --> 10:04.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, my God, Kendall is literally...</font>

10:05.960 --> 10:07.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Has Kendall seen that?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">No.</font>

10:19.960 --> 10:23.000
Coming up,
Kendall attempts a come back.

10:23.160 --> 10:25.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I would like to carry on</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">getting to know you.</font>

10:25.960 --> 10:28.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I just know what I want</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and I want Adam.</font>

10:34.960 --> 10:39.960
After dropping Kendall, Adam was
kissing Rosie within four minutes.

10:39.960 --> 10:41.960
Disgraceful.

10:41.960 --> 10:45.960
If he'd run back from the swing
chair, he could have been going at it
in under two.

10:45.960 --> 10:48.320
And only Wes and Laura
saw what they were up to.

10:48.480 --> 10:51.960
<font color="#FFFF00">So you're getting on well, then?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> A little bit.</font>

10:51.960 --> 10:53.960
<font color="#11FF11">We literally didn't even...</font>

10:53.960 --> 10:55.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I just looked at you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and I was like...</font>

10:55.960 --> 10:58.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I was looking over, I could see</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you two, I can deal with them.</font>

10:58.960 --> 11:00.960
<font color="#11FF11">No-one else saw.</font>

11:00.960 --> 11:02.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm shaking.</font>

11:03.960 --> 11:06.640
<font color="#11FF11">Shaking because you like him,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">though?</font>

11:06.800 --> 11:09.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I like him, he's very much my type,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and we can chat.</font>

11:09.960 --> 11:15.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I just talk until someone shuts me</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">up.  Yeah...</font>

11:20.640 --> 11:23.800
<font color="#00FFFF">Adam has actually</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">really surprised me.</font>

11:23.960 --> 11:26.960
<font color="#00FFFF">He said there was a bit of something</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">there with me and him,</font>

11:26.960 --> 11:30.480
<font color="#00FFFF">which was nice. So we did have a</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">little kiss, yeah.</font>

11:31.960 --> 11:34.960
So Rosie's happy,
but Kendall is feeling down.

11:34.960 --> 11:37.000
So Eyal's taken her to the pool
for a talk.

11:37.160 --> 11:39.960
At the deep end, obvs.

11:39.960 --> 11:42.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Adam's basically just</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">pulled me aside and said,</font>

11:42.960 --> 11:46.960
<font color="#FFFF00">"I just want to call it a day</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with me and you."</font>

11:46.960 --> 11:49.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Just because two new girls</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">have come in,</font>

11:49.960 --> 11:52.000
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm not going to jump on him,</font>

11:52.160 --> 11:54.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm not going to like</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">be all over him and kiss him.</font>

11:54.960 --> 11:58.480
<font color="#FFFF00">That would be fake. He tried to kiss</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">me twice last night and I didn't,</font>

11:58.640 --> 12:00.960
<font color="#FFFF00">because I just wanted</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to take it slow.</font>

12:00.960 --> 12:02.960
<font color="#FFFF00">And I think,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you're just making me look...</font>

12:02.960 --> 12:05.960
<font color="#FFFF00">like a bit of an idiot.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">You know what I mean?</font>

12:05.960 --> 12:11.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I don't wanna like just try</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and save my place and save me</font>

12:11.960 --> 12:17.960
<font color="#FFFF00">for the sake of it when other people</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">can be happy. You know what I mean?</font>

12:17.960 --> 12:22.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah, but at the same time, I don't</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">think you should put pressure on</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">yourself to feel something yet.</font>

12:23.160 --> 12:27.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, well, I wasn't. And then</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">he's fucking done that, so...</font>

12:27.960 --> 12:30.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah, but, like, all due respect,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I like Adam a lot,</font>

12:30.960 --> 12:34.960
<font color="#00FFFF">but I think his track record</font>

12:34.960 --> 12:39.960
<font color="#00FFFF">says that he likes to fucking know</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and get what he wants. Straight up.</font>

12:40.000 --> 12:43.640
<font color="#00FFFF">Otherwise he's probably out</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and onto the next one.</font>

12:43.800 --> 12:47.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I just feel so stupid</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">for crying all the time.</font>

12:47.960 --> 12:51.960
<font color="#00FFFF">It's OK to cry sometimes.</font>

12:52.000 --> 12:55.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Maybe in here, you're gonna cry</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">more than in the outside world</font>

12:55.960 --> 12:57.960
<font color="#00FFFF">because emotions run high.</font>

12:59.480 --> 13:01.480
<font color="#FFFF00">(SIGHS)  God.</font>

13:01.640 --> 13:04.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I see an opportunity with Kendall</font>

13:04.960 --> 13:07.960
<font color="#00FFFF">that I can maybe</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">just get to know her</font>

13:07.960 --> 13:11.960
<font color="#00FFFF">and actually just be there for her,</font>

13:11.960 --> 13:15.000
<font color="#00FFFF">and obviously</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm attracted to her, so...</font>

13:15.160 --> 13:17.960
<font color="#00FFFF">And that's something</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">that interests me.</font>

13:17.960 --> 13:22.960
After today, it's pretty clear Jack
would give his eye teeth for a
relationship with Dani.

13:22.960 --> 13:26.960
And those bad boys have
a street value of 17,000 euros.

13:26.960 --> 13:29.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I said it from the start, I've not</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">changed what I've said,</font>

13:29.960 --> 13:31.960
<font color="#FFFF00">you've made the right decision.</font>

13:31.960 --> 13:33.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I know. I think I have.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">You have, I promise you.</font>

13:33.960 --> 13:36.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I just want us to get to know</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">each other a bit more.</font>

13:36.960 --> 13:39.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I feel like me and Jack today</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">have actually grown a little bit.</font>

13:39.960 --> 13:44.960
<font color="#00FFFF">In one day, we have grown.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I actually feel more myself now.</font>

13:44.960 --> 13:46.960
<font color="#00FFFF">A little bit more open with him.</font>

13:46.960 --> 13:49.160
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm happy today. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> You're happy today?</font>

13:49.320 --> 13:52.000
<font color="#FFFF00">This is the happiest I've felt</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">since I've been here.</font>

13:52.160 --> 13:55.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I promise you, I'm not... All jokes</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">aside,  it's the happiest I've been.</font>

13:56.000 --> 14:01.960
<font color="#FFFF00">You know what I mean? I feel like</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a weight's been lifted. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Yeah? </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I do.</font>

14:01.960 --> 14:06.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I honestly do. Do you?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Do you or not? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Of course I do.</font>

14:06.960 --> 14:08.960
<font color="#00FFFF">It's just been weird, hasn't it.</font>

14:08.960 --> 14:12.960
<font color="#11FF11"># Bring me a higher love</font>

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
<font color="#FFFF00">It's on!</font>

14:23.960 --> 14:28.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, my God. What is wrong with him?</font>

14:28.960 --> 14:31.800
<font color="#00FFFF">Wes, you need to calm down</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">on the caffeine.</font>

14:31.960 --> 14:33.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Woo! Finally!</font>

14:33.960 --> 14:35.960
<font color="#00FFFF">We had a kiss and I felt like</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I just got married.</font>

14:35.960 --> 14:39.960
<font color="#00FFFF">When Meghan walked down the aisle</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and got married and that,</font>

14:39.960 --> 14:42.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I feel like that was me. Everyone</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">was cheering. It was lovely.</font>

14:42.960 --> 14:46.960
<font color="#00FFFF">The audience was great, and</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I can't thank them for it. Enough.</font>

14:46.960 --> 14:48.960
<font color="#00FFFF">But, nah, it was all right,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">weren't it?</font>

14:49.960 --> 14:54.960
<font color="#11FF11">Shake it for me. Shake it.</font>

14:54.960 --> 14:57.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I love it, mate.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I saw that, necking on.</font>

14:57.960 --> 15:01.000
<font color="#FFFF00">I tell you what,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I must be like a Cheshire cat,</font>

15:01.160 --> 15:03.160
<font color="#FFFF00">I haven't stopped smiling.</font>

15:03.320 --> 15:06.960
<font color="#FFFF00">It didn't feel weird,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">it just felt nice and natural.</font>

15:06.960 --> 15:10.800
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm really happy, and I'm</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">excited now. I'm really excited.</font>

15:11.960 --> 15:15.320
So they're all smiles now,
but I smell a rat.

15:15.480 --> 15:18.960
Not that kind,
it's a figure of speech.

15:22.960 --> 15:26.960
<font color="#FFFF00">You know what's gone on, don't you?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">They had a little kiss.</font>

15:26.960 --> 15:28.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, you didn't?</font>

15:28.960 --> 15:31.960
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, that took long.  That's fine.</font>

15:31.960 --> 15:33.960
<font color="#11FF11">You know what?</font>

15:33.960 --> 15:35.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Cos he's not gonna tell you.</font>

15:35.960 --> 15:38.960
<font color="#11FF11">He's kissed her.</font>

15:38.960 --> 15:41.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Mate, I've snogged her</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">already tonight. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Have you?</font>

15:41.960 --> 15:44.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Straight in for the kill.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I love the naughty side of her.</font>

15:44.960 --> 15:47.640
<font color="#FFFF00">She's got a fucking</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">little cheeky side to her,</font>

15:47.800 --> 15:49.960
<font color="#FFFF00">and it makes us crease every time.</font>

15:49.960 --> 15:52.000
<font color="#FFFF00">Like, you know when</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the flirt is there.</font>

15:52.160 --> 15:55.960
<font color="#00FFFF">That is excellent, mate.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm gonna sleep on the sofa tonight.</font>

15:55.960 --> 16:00.480
<font color="#00FFFF">That would make a good statement.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">That's not a bad idea, to be honest.</font>

16:00.960 --> 16:03.960
<font color="#11FF11">I lose everything.</font>

16:03.960 --> 16:06.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Kendall, I was gonna talk to you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">in the morning,</font>

16:06.960 --> 16:09.640
<font color="#FFFF00">because I didn't think tonight</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">was the right time.</font>

16:09.800 --> 16:12.960
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, yeah. It's all right. He spoke</font>
<font color="#11FF11">to me before it happened with you.</font>

16:13.000 --> 16:19.000
<font color="#FFFF00">I was going to speak to you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">in the morning. </font><font color="#11FF11"> It's all right.</font>

16:19.160 --> 16:23.640
<font color="#11FF11">It's all right. No, it's fine.</font>

16:52.960 --> 16:56.960
<font color="#00FFFF"># I usually love sleeping all alone </font>

16:56.960 --> 16:59.960
<font color="#00FFFF"># This time bring a friend with you</font>

16:59.960 --> 17:03.800
<font color="#00FFFF"># But we ain't really</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">gonna sleep at all</font>

17:03.960 --> 17:07.960
<font color="#00FFFF"># You ain't gonna catch me with them</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">sneak pictures, sneak pictures</font>

17:07.960 --> 17:10.960
<font color="#00FFFF"># In my city I'm a young god...</font>

17:33.000 --> 17:36.960
<font color="#00FFFF"># I've been talking to your</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">answerphone, nah, nah</font>

17:36.960 --> 17:40.960
<font color="#00FFFF"># Something tells me</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you don't want to know, nah, nah</font>

17:40.960 --> 17:42.960
After all the drama of yesterday,

17:42.960 --> 17:46.960
those poor islanders
have earned themselves a lie-in.

17:51.960 --> 17:55.960
Which they can have tomorrow.
Where's my curtain remote control?

17:56.960 --> 17:58.960
These things are brilliant!

17:58.960 --> 18:01.480
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, my bum cheeks</font>
<font color="#11FF11">from that bloody thing!</font>

18:01.640 --> 18:05.160
<font color="#00FFFF">I was just thinking the same.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">My legs!</font>

18:06.320 --> 18:09.320
<font color="#00FFFF">I did not expect you</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to be on the bloody couch tonight.</font>

18:20.960 --> 18:25.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Did you message Rosie at one point?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Because her phone went off.</font>

18:25.960 --> 18:27.960
<font color="#11FF11">You did, didn't you?</font>

18:27.960 --> 18:29.960
<font color="#11FF11">Ha!</font>

18:30.960 --> 18:32.960
<font color="#FFFF00">What did it say?</font>

18:32.960 --> 18:36.000
<font color="#00FFFF">Plenty of room, dot, dot, dot.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Did it actually?</font>

18:38.640 --> 18:41.960
<font color="#11FF11">Adam. Adam is great.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">He's a great guy.</font>

18:41.960 --> 18:44.960
<font color="#11FF11">I just love he's embracing</font>
<font color="#11FF11">that he is an oily big snake.</font>

18:44.960 --> 18:47.960
<font color="#11FF11">Just snaking everyone.</font>

18:47.960 --> 18:50.960
Adam's finally got Rosie onto a sofa.

18:50.960 --> 18:54.960
But I'm guessing this isn't quite
what he had in mind. The oily snake.

18:54.960 --> 18:56.960
<font color="#00FFFF">How was last night?</font>

18:56.960 --> 19:02.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, I was a bit torn.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I didn't know what to do.</font>

19:02.960 --> 19:05.480
<font color="#00FFFF">What do you mean?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Like, to come and see you or not.</font>

19:05.640 --> 19:08.800
<font color="#FFFF00">You didn't text me back.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Well, you know...</font>

19:08.960 --> 19:12.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Don't be playing those games.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm not playing those games.</font>

19:12.960 --> 19:16.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I fell asleep. I did. I fell asleep.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I had a really nice sofa to myself.</font>

19:16.960 --> 19:19.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Was it comfy? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> It was actually</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">really comfy, you know.</font>

19:19.960 --> 19:22.960
<font color="#00FFFF">You would have really enjoyed it.</font>

19:22.960 --> 19:25.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, I'm definitely excited</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">about Adam.</font>

19:25.960 --> 19:30.160
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm definitely a bit giddy,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">bit like a schoolgirl, and smiling.</font>

19:30.320 --> 19:34.960
<font color="#FFFF00">It started well, anyway,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">but I do want to take it slow.</font>

19:34.960 --> 19:38.480
<font color="#FFFF00">Hopefully it will lead somewhere.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">We'll see.</font>

19:38.640 --> 19:43.960
Kendall and Dani are doing one of
those emotional workouts which are
all the rage in the gym right now.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Come on, guys. No pain, no gain.

19:46.160 --> 19:48.160
<font color="#FFFF00">How are you feeling today?</font>

19:48.320 --> 19:50.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Feeling all right today.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Good, I worry about you.</font>

19:50.960 --> 19:53.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I have got a clear head today.</font>

19:53.960 --> 19:55.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Like, it is what it is.</font>

19:55.960 --> 19:57.960
<font color="#FFFF00">It weren't meant to happen</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">for a reason.</font>

20:02.640 --> 20:05.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Like, that was a bit, like,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">oh, that hurt.</font>

20:05.960 --> 20:08.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I heard that, like,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">they had a kiss,</font>

20:08.960 --> 20:12.640
<font color="#00FFFF">so he obviously</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">wants to move quicker</font>

20:12.800 --> 20:15.960
<font color="#00FFFF">and he doesn't want to wait around</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">for me, which is fair enough.</font>

20:15.960 --> 20:17.960
<font color="#00FFFF">It was just really cut-throat.</font>

20:17.960 --> 20:21.960
<font color="#00FFFF">It does get to me a little bit,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">because obviously I am attracted to</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">him.</font>

20:22.960 --> 20:25.960
The villa's favourite oily snake
has been a bit of a love rat

20:25.960 --> 20:30.960
but now the cat's out of the bag
Kendall wants to hear the truth
straight from the horse's mouth.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
Hang on, what animal is he?

20:33.160 --> 20:36.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Obviously I heard that</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">last night, like,</font>

20:36.960 --> 20:41.960
<font color="#00FFFF">you had a little kiss with Rosie.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah.</font>

20:43.960 --> 20:45.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I do feel gutted.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah?</font>

20:45.960 --> 20:50.960
<font color="#00FFFF">It is not nice.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Really?</font>

20:50.960 --> 20:55.960
<font color="#FFFF00">It's so weird, I feel like</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">there was nothing really wrong</font>

20:55.960 --> 21:00.960
<font color="#FFFF00">with me and you, I just got the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">feeling it couldn't go any further.</font>

21:00.960 --> 21:03.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I do think we do get on.</font>

21:03.960 --> 21:07.800
<font color="#00FFFF">I am not gonna lie and say neither</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">of us are attracted to each other.</font>

21:07.960 --> 21:10.960
<font color="#FFFF00">No, of course we are.  I still am.</font>

21:10.960 --> 21:14.640
<font color="#FFFF00">I still fancy you from</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the first time I saw you.</font>

21:14.800 --> 21:17.800
<font color="#00FFFF">Then maybe this is the chance</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">for me to tell you</font>

21:17.960 --> 21:19.960
<font color="#00FFFF">that I do still...</font>

21:19.960 --> 21:21.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I do still like you.</font>

21:21.960 --> 21:23.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I would like to carry on</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">getting to know you.</font>

21:23.960 --> 21:25.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I know obviously</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you have called it a day</font>

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
<font color="#00FFFF">and you are hitting</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">things off with Rosie</font>

21:28.160 --> 21:30.960
<font color="#00FFFF">but, like, I do get jealous.</font>

21:32.800 --> 21:36.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Kendall has pretty much just</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">in two minutes gave us more</font>

21:36.960 --> 21:41.320
<font color="#FFFF00">than the whole time I spent with her</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">in the full villa previously.</font>

21:41.480 --> 21:44.960
<font color="#FFFF00">It took me kissing Rosie</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to actually spark that.</font>

21:44.960 --> 21:47.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I like the fact</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">she actually came over to us</font>

21:47.960 --> 21:51.640
<font color="#FFFF00">and said it upset her, because</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">now I know she actually cares.</font>

21:51.800 --> 21:56.000
<font color="#FFFF00">It is probably bad</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">but I prefer you jealous.</font>

21:56.160 --> 21:59.960
<font color="#00FFFF">You are such a boy.</font>

21:59.960 --> 22:01.960
<font color="#FFFF00">No, I don't</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">mean I prefer you jealous.</font>

22:01.960 --> 22:03.960
<font color="#FFFF00">But I prefer the fact...</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">hold on, right,</font>

22:03.960 --> 22:07.960
<font color="#FFFF00">it is the first time you have said</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">something like that to us ever.</font>

22:07.960 --> 22:09.960
<font color="#00FFFF">To you?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah.</font>

22:09.960 --> 22:12.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah, you had to push</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">my buttons to get it.</font>

22:18.960 --> 22:22.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I just know what I want</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and I want Adam.</font>

22:22.960 --> 22:24.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I am not gonna...</font>

22:24.960 --> 22:28.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I am not going to pursue anything</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">else just to try and save my skin.</font>

22:30.800 --> 22:34.320
<font color="#FFFF00">I will come over and then we will</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">get a drink. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> All right, see you in a</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">bit.</font>

22:44.800 --> 22:47.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I think I might have judged</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Kendall a little bit too soon.</font>

22:47.960 --> 22:49.960
<font color="#FFFF00">If I'm being brutally</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">honest with myself.</font>

22:49.960 --> 22:52.640
<font color="#FFFF00">Yes, it was annoying</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">when I was with her, </font>

22:52.800 --> 22:55.960
<font color="#FFFF00">but maybe I was a bit rash</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with my decision.</font>

22:55.960 --> 22:58.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Maybe I was a bit rash.</font>

22:58.960 --> 23:01.960
<font color="#FFFF00">She told us pretty much</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">everything I wanted to hear.</font>

23:01.960 --> 23:03.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Now it is playing</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with my head completely,</font>

23:04.000 --> 23:07.960
<font color="#FFFF00">because now I am considering</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the both of them as options for me</font>

23:07.960 --> 23:09.960
<font color="#FFFF00">when it comes to re-coupling.</font>

23:09.960 --> 23:12.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I am surprised at that reaction.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I didn't expect to get it.</font>

23:12.960 --> 23:16.960
<font color="#FFFF00">It is a good reaction from her,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the best reaction I've had from her.</font>

23:16.960 --> 23:18.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Funny how that works, isn't it?</font>

23:18.960 --> 23:21.960
<font color="#11FF11">Makes you feel more towards them,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">dunnit? </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Yeah.</font>

23:28.960 --> 23:30.960
Still to come...

23:30.960 --> 23:32.960
Text spells trouble.

23:32.960 --> 23:34.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Tonight there will be re-coupling.</font>

23:34.960 --> 23:38.960
<font color="#FFFF00">The girl not picked to be in a</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">couple  will be dumped from the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">island.</font>

23:38.960 --> 23:40.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh my days!</font>

23:48.800 --> 23:51.480
This show has been accused
of dumbing down Britain.

23:51.640 --> 23:53.960
We are about to prove
the naysayers wrong.

23:53.960 --> 23:58.960
Step aside, Radio 4, as we deliver
some cold, hard politics.

23:58.960 --> 24:00.960
Georgia, if you will.

24:00.960 --> 24:03.960
<font color="#FFFF00">What do you think about Brexit?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">What's that?</font>

24:03.960 --> 24:06.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Where we are leaving</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the European Union.</font>

24:06.960 --> 24:08.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I seriously don't have a clue.</font>

24:08.960 --> 24:12.800
<font color="#11FF11">It was to leave the EU,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">so we wouldn't be part of Europe.</font>

24:12.960 --> 24:15.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Which would mean, like, welfare,</font>

24:15.960 --> 24:18.960
<font color="#FFFF00">and things we trade with</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">would be cut down.</font>

24:18.960 --> 24:20.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Does that mean</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">we won't have any trees?</font>

24:20.960 --> 24:22.960
<font color="#11FF11">Cheese?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Trees.</font>

24:22.960 --> 24:26.480
<font color="#FFFF00">No, that's got nothing to do</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with it, babe. That is weather.</font>

24:26.640 --> 24:29.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Why wouldn't we have trees?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Well, you was talking about...</font>

24:29.960 --> 24:31.960
<font color="#FFFF00">We are just not in</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the European Union.</font>

24:31.960 --> 24:33.960
<font color="#FFFF00">It is still classed</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">as being in Europe.</font>

24:33.960 --> 24:37.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Doesn't it mean it would be harder</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to, like,  go to like, Spain and</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">stuff?</font>

24:37.960 --> 24:40.960
<font color="#11FF11">It will be harder to go on holiday?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, I think so.</font>

24:40.960 --> 24:42.960
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, I love my holidays.</font>

24:47.960 --> 24:53.960
Sorry, guys, I am still reeling from
finding out Nigel Farage is gonna cut
down all the trees.

24:53.960 --> 24:55.960
Just send them a text!

24:55.960 --> 24:58.640
(BEEPING)
<font color="#FFFF00">Got a text!</font>

24:58.800 --> 25:00.800
(CHEERING)

25:12.960 --> 25:17.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, my fucking days.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, my God.</font>

25:17.960 --> 25:21.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Shi-it.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, my fuck.</font>

25:21.960 --> 25:24.960
<font color="#11FF11">I think I want to cry a little bit.</font>

25:24.960 --> 25:27.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Boys have got all</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the power right now.</font>

25:27.960 --> 25:29.960
<font color="#FFFF00">It is actually terrifying.</font>

25:29.960 --> 25:33.800
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, my God.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Be dumped from the island?</font>

25:33.960 --> 25:36.960
<font color="#00FFFF">That is fucking full out! That was</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">mad.  One girl is gonna go.</font>

25:36.960 --> 25:38.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Re-coupling, tonight.</font>

25:38.960 --> 25:41.960
<font color="#00FFFF">People starting to get a bit</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">panicky and be, like, whoa,</font>

25:41.960 --> 25:44.960
<font color="#00FFFF">because I don't think</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">we expected it at all.</font>

25:44.960 --> 25:46.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Eyal, love you! </font>

25:49.960 --> 25:52.960
<font color="#11FF11">My gut is telling me</font>
<font color="#11FF11">that Hayley is not genuine.</font>

25:52.960 --> 25:56.960
<font color="#11FF11">Even what she just did outside,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">when the text came through,</font>

25:56.960 --> 26:00.960
<font color="#11FF11">she ran up to me and said,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">"I love you", and gave me a hug,</font>

26:00.960 --> 26:02.960
<font color="#11FF11">and it's like,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">are you fucking serious?</font>

26:02.960 --> 26:04.960
<font color="#FFFF00">At least you are all right.</font>

26:05.960 --> 26:08.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Girls, we don't know</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">that for a fact.</font>

26:08.960 --> 26:11.960
<font color="#11FF11">Are you gonna go mad on the spot?</font>

26:11.960 --> 26:15.960
<font color="#00FFFF">He has got a screw loose.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">And so have I.</font>

26:15.960 --> 26:17.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Think that is why we are all right.</font>

26:17.960 --> 26:19.960
<font color="#FFFF00">You just bounce off each other,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you two.</font>

26:19.960 --> 26:23.640
<font color="#00FFFF">At the end of the day, girls,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you really don't know.</font>

26:23.800 --> 26:26.960
<font color="#00FFFF">He might see me tonight and think,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">she ain't a bit of me.</font>

26:26.960 --> 26:30.960
<font color="#11FF11">I doubt that, George.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I really hope Niall picks me.</font>

26:30.960 --> 26:34.960
<font color="#00FFFF">To be honest, I haven't really</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">tried with anybody else.</font>

26:34.960 --> 26:39.960
<font color="#00FFFF">So now that could work</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to my disadvantage. I think.</font>

26:39.960 --> 26:43.960
You'll be all right, Georgia.
You are the Hermione to Niall's Ron.

26:43.960 --> 26:48.960
Rosie is worried Adam might give her
a bit of the old 'expelliarmus'.

26:48.960 --> 26:50.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Are you stressed about the text?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Hmm?</font>

26:50.960 --> 26:53.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Are you stressed about the text?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">No, it's just a bit...</font>

26:53.960 --> 26:56.960
<font color="#00FFFF">obviously we've only</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">been in here a day.</font>

26:56.960 --> 26:59.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I only got to know you</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">a bit better last night.</font>

26:59.960 --> 27:02.960
<font color="#00FFFF">We have played it a bit careful</font>

27:02.960 --> 27:04.960
<font color="#00FFFF">because we didn't want</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to hurt Kendall.</font>

27:04.960 --> 27:09.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah. I am considering everything</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">but I'm not gonna give anyone</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">an answer right now.</font>

27:09.960 --> 27:13.640
<font color="#FFFF00">I am a normal human being. I have</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">got to know  a lot of people in here.</font>

27:13.960 --> 27:16.480
<font color="#00FFFF">Right now I am worried</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">about the re-coupling.</font>

27:16.640 --> 27:19.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Adam just said he is</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">considering his options.</font>

27:19.960 --> 27:22.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I am not really a girl</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you can keep playing with</font>

27:22.960 --> 27:25.960
<font color="#00FFFF">and leading on and then</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">changing your mind.</font>

27:25.960 --> 27:29.960
<font color="#00FFFF">You are either in it or you're not.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">If you're not...bye-bye.</font>

27:29.960 --> 27:32.000
Well, Adam made his sofa bed

27:32.160 --> 27:34.960
and it looks like
Rosie might not want to lie in it.

27:34.960 --> 27:37.960
But I do know someone who is still
holding a 'Kendall' for him.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.960
<font color="#FFFF00">The thing is with Adam,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I think he thinks he's got it.</font>

27:40.960 --> 27:43.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Good with Rosie. I think</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">he'd prefer to be with Rosie</font>

27:43.960 --> 27:47.000
<font color="#FFFF00">because he knows where</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">he stands with her.</font>

27:47.160 --> 27:50.800
<font color="#FFFF00">So I am just prepared to go now.</font>

27:50.960 --> 27:53.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I think he's into her.</font>

27:53.960 --> 27:57.800
<font color="#FFFF00">But then I can't help</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">being attracted to him.</font>

27:57.960 --> 27:59.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Urgh!</font>

27:59.960 --> 28:02.960
Hayley is beginning to think
she might have to decide

28:02.960 --> 28:05.960
between spending summer
in a luxury villa in paradise

28:05.960 --> 28:08.960
or an EasyJet flight home.
It's a tough one.

28:14.320 --> 28:16.320
<font color="#00FFFF">As one of his options.</font>

28:16.480 --> 28:19.960
<font color="#00FFFF">You're one of his options</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and Kendall is one of his options.</font>

28:22.960 --> 28:27.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Just see where it goes. If it</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">doesn't go anywhere at least you can</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">say you've had a go, haven't you?</font>

28:27.960 --> 28:31.480
<font color="#00FFFF">It is better than fucking going</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">home and doing nothing, isn't it?</font>

28:31.640 --> 28:33.640
<font color="#FFFF00">I am just shitting myself now.</font>

28:33.800 --> 28:37.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't want to act like I'm</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">grafting  because fucking re-coupling</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">is coming up.</font>

28:37.960 --> 28:39.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I feel like I'm going, to be honest.</font>

28:44.960 --> 28:48.480
Hayley or Kendall,
Eyal's got some thinking to do,

28:48.640 --> 28:50.640
and no-one does thinking like Eyal.

28:50.800 --> 28:52.800
Hashtag deep.

28:52.960 --> 28:54.960
For Jack, however,
the decision has been made.

28:55.000 --> 28:59.160
<font color="#FFFF00">Am I safe tonight then, yeah?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Obviously, you know you are.</font>

28:59.320 --> 29:04.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I didn't even think of it.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Imagine that...</font>

29:04.960 --> 29:07.960
<font color="#FFFF00">The first week has been nice.</font>

29:07.960 --> 29:11.960
<font color="#00FFFF">We have done a full week together,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">haven't we?</font>

29:11.960 --> 29:14.960
<font color="#FFFF00">It has felt like it 'n all!</font>

29:14.960 --> 29:19.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I would be surprised</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">if he didn't choose me.</font>

29:19.960 --> 29:25.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Hopefully he does. He would be silly</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">not to, really. I have given him the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">time of day now, haven't I?</font>

29:25.960 --> 29:27.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Might cry when you give me</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">your speech.</font>

29:27.960 --> 29:30.640
<font color="#00FFFF">I look forward to giving the speech.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Are you?</font>

29:30.800 --> 29:33.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Nervous though.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">She's so beautiful and lovely.</font>

29:33.960 --> 29:35.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, God!</font>

29:35.960 --> 29:37.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I swear, don't laugh at me, please.</font>

29:37.960 --> 29:39.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Wear nice trousers.</font>

29:40.960 --> 29:45.960
Hayley has just heard all the extra
leg-room seats on the EasyJet flight
have gone.

29:45.960 --> 29:47.960
Looks like Eyal it is.

29:47.960 --> 29:51.960
<font color="#11FF11">I don't want you to think, like,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">it's out of desperation or anything,</font>

29:51.960 --> 29:57.320
<font color="#11FF11">but obviously I feel like</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I have not got to know Eyal</font>

29:57.480 --> 30:01.960
<font color="#11FF11">as much as everyone else, and maybe</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I have ruled it out  before I've even</font>
<font color="#11FF11">tried with you.</font>

30:02.160 --> 30:04.160
<font color="#11FF11">Maybe I do need to get to know you</font>

30:04.320 --> 30:06.960
<font color="#11FF11">just as much as I've got</font>
<font color="#11FF11">to know everyone else.</font>

30:06.960 --> 30:11.960
<font color="#FFFF00">All I ever wanted was for you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to try and get to know me.</font>

30:11.960 --> 30:14.960
<font color="#FFFF00">And yes, since yesterday and today,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I feel like you have.</font>

30:14.960 --> 30:19.960
<font color="#11FF11">Have you got a spark with anyone?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Because if you do, then fair do's.</font>

30:19.960 --> 30:23.960
<font color="#11FF11">But obviously be open about it.</font>

30:23.960 --> 30:27.960
<font color="#11FF11">I wanted to tell you</font>
<font color="#11FF11">how I feel about the situation.</font>

30:27.960 --> 30:30.960
<font color="#11FF11">Obviously I am just explaining</font>
<font color="#11FF11">before you make your decision.</font>

30:31.000 --> 30:35.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I know you are,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and I really appreciate that.</font>

30:35.960 --> 30:39.960
<font color="#FFFF00">It lets me know a little bit</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">where your head is actually at.</font>

30:41.960 --> 30:44.320
<font color="#11FF11">Just shit.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, it is shit.</font>

30:47.960 --> 30:51.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Now I'm in this position Hayley has</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">started to show me some interest.</font>

30:51.960 --> 30:55.960
<font color="#FFFF00">In a sense it is too little,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">too late.</font>

30:55.960 --> 30:59.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Why are you all of a sudden</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">showing me this interest</font>

30:59.960 --> 31:02.960
<font color="#FFFF00">because you know that</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">re-coupling is coming up?</font>

31:02.960 --> 31:04.960
<font color="#00FFFF">What are you thinking</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">for a re-couple?</font>

31:04.960 --> 31:09.160
<font color="#FFFF00">I actually have no fucking idea</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">at this moment in time.</font>

31:09.320 --> 31:13.480
<font color="#FFFF00">I am not going to have an idea</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">until right before it happens.</font>

31:13.640 --> 31:18.960
<font color="#00FFFF">It is either Kendall</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">or Hayley, innit?</font>

31:18.960 --> 31:22.960
<font color="#FFFF00">As soon as Hayley saw me</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">kiss Kendall yesterday</font>

31:22.960 --> 31:27.960
<font color="#FFFF00">she has completely changed her tune.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Her whole vibe towards me.</font>

31:27.960 --> 31:29.960
<font color="#11FF11">In the sense of like...?</font>

31:29.960 --> 31:35.160
<font color="#FFFF00">In the sense of trying</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to get to know me.</font>

31:35.320 --> 31:37.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I am not here to hurt</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">anyone's feelings</font>

31:37.960 --> 31:41.960
<font color="#FFFF00">or to make any rash...</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">crazy decisions</font>

31:41.960 --> 31:45.960
<font color="#FFFF00">that I can't come back from. I am</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">not here to  be someone's lifeline.</font>

31:45.960 --> 31:49.160
<font color="#11FF11">Not even as friends? </font><font color="#FFFF00"> No, there are</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">other people  in this villa</font>

31:49.320 --> 31:51.320
<font color="#FFFF00">that I would like to get to know.</font>

31:51.480 --> 31:54.960
<font color="#11FF11">I think Eyal might choose Kendall,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">because he has tried with Hayley</font>
<font color="#11FF11">already.</font>

31:54.960 --> 31:58.960
<font color="#11FF11">If I was Hayley right now</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I would be worried.</font>

31:58.960 --> 32:02.320
<font color="#11FF11">It is just awful.</font>

32:02.480 --> 32:04.960
We know Jack has written
his re-coupling speech

32:04.960 --> 32:06.960
and Adam has finished his too.

32:06.960 --> 32:09.960
It goes, "I love this girl
more than life itself."

32:09.960 --> 32:13.960
Then there is a blank space where he
can stick a name when he makes up his
mind.

32:13.960 --> 32:16.960
<font color="#00FFFF">What would you miss more,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">if Kendall walked out now</font>

32:16.960 --> 32:18.960
<font color="#00FFFF">or Rosie walked out now?</font>

32:18.960 --> 32:20.960
<font color="#00FFFF">What would make your heart</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">ache more?</font>

32:20.960 --> 32:22.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Who would I miss more?</font>

32:22.960 --> 32:27.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Like, I would miss Kendall more</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">because I have had more time</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to spend with her</font>

32:27.960 --> 32:31.960
<font color="#FFFF00">and I have spoken to her much more.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I have only spoken to Rosie for a</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">day.</font>

32:31.960 --> 32:35.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Rosie was cheeky and Rosie was fun</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">but is it a dead end?</font>

32:35.960 --> 32:38.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Is it never gonna work?</font>

32:38.960 --> 32:42.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Am I just coupling up with someone</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">who is going to be a dead end</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">anyway?</font>

32:42.960 --> 32:45.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Will it be the whole thing</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">for the whole time here?</font>

32:45.960 --> 32:47.960
<font color="#00FFFF">That is it, that is a dead end.</font>

32:47.960 --> 32:50.320
<font color="#00FFFF">That is a regret, then, isn't it?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah.</font>

32:50.480 --> 32:54.960
<font color="#FFFF00">That's worse, isn't it? Not knowing</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">is worse than messing up, isn't it?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah.</font>

32:55.960 --> 32:57.960
<font color="#FFFF00">She's fit as well.</font>

32:58.960 --> 33:00.960
Still to come...

33:00.960 --> 33:02.960
It's decision time for Adam.

33:02.960 --> 33:05.320
<font color="#FFFF00">The girl that I want</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to couple up with is...</font>

33:14.960 --> 33:18.960
Darkness is falling, the air is
thick with tension, and there is an

33:18.960 --> 33:24.320
Uber waiting out front. It is nearly
time for the re-coupling.

33:24.480 --> 33:32.960
<font color="#FFFF00">It is on Adam, isn't it?</font>

33:36.960 --> 33:39.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I think there's definitely tension</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">in the villa at</font>

33:39.960 --> 33:43.000
<font color="#00FFFF">the moment with the re-coupling</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">being so imminent. Some of the boys</font>

33:43.160 --> 33:46.960
<font color="#00FFFF">do not even know who they will be</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">re-coupling with. I think there</font>

33:46.960 --> 33:49.800
<font color="#00FFFF">might be a few surprises to come.</font>

33:49.960 --> 33:52.960
<font color="#FFFF00">How is everyone feeling? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Nervous.</font>

33:52.960 --> 33:58.960
<font color="#11FF11">It is happening. Got to go with it.</font>

33:58.960 --> 34:02.960
<font color="#FFFF00">The re-coupling tonight feels like</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">it is the biggest thing that has</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">happened so far.</font>

34:06.960 --> 34:13.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I wish Kendall had not had</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the chat with us today. Before that,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I was set on what I was doing.</font>

34:20.960 --> 34:24.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I feel like there is not even any</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">point speculating, as we do not</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">even</font>

34:24.960 --> 34:28.960
<font color="#FFFF00">know. Someone is going home, it is</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">really sad, it could be me, I don't</font>

34:28.960 --> 34:39.000
<font color="#FFFF00">know. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, my God, Hayley. I am</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">borrowing that. You will be.</font>

34:39.159 --> 34:42.960
<font color="#11FF11">I am so nervous right now.</font>

34:42.960 --> 34:47.960
<font color="#11FF11">Obviously I could be going. I am in</font>
<font color="#11FF11">a very vulnerable situation right</font>
<font color="#11FF11">now.</font>

34:47.960 --> 34:52.960
<font color="#11FF11">I have to wait to see what happens,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I don't know where Eyal's head is</font>
<font color="#11FF11">at.</font>

34:57.000 --> 34:58.960
<font color="#FFFF00">What are you thinking, big man?</font>

34:59.000 --> 35:03.960
<font color="#00FFFF">To go slightly against my gut, but</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">trust in what I stand by.</font>

35:03.960 --> 35:09.800
<font color="#00FFFF">I will go with</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">how I feel and trust in myself.</font>

35:09.960 --> 35:11.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Whatever happens...</font>

35:18.960 --> 35:22.320
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm just glad I spoke to him today.</font>

35:22.480 --> 35:25.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I probably would have regretted not</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">putting it out there.</font>

35:25.960 --> 35:32.320
<font color="#FFFF00">I am quite nervous, actually. I do</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">feel pretty sick. About re-coupling</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">now.</font>

35:32.480 --> 35:35.960
You are nervous?
<font color="#FFFF00">Really nervous.</font>

35:35.960 --> 35:40.480
It is weird,
things change so quickly in here.

35:40.640 --> 35:45.960
<font color="#FFFF00">If he means what he said and he does</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">feel a connection.</font>

35:45.960 --> 35:51.000
Do you feel that there is a
connection? <font color="#FFFF00">Yes. My head is</font>

35:51.160 --> 35:55.960
<font color="#FFFF00">going crazy, my stomach is going</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">crazy. I literally don't know what</font>

35:55.960 --> 36:00.960
<font color="#FFFF00">he is thinking. Or what Adam is</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">going to do, I have no idea.</font>

36:00.960 --> 36:05.960
I think there is a lot of tension,
you could almost cut the atmosphere
with a knife.

36:05.960 --> 36:09.960
I am still in two minds as to what
I'm going to do. I have

36:09.960 --> 36:14.960
obviously got Kendall, who I have
had some sort of thing with for the

36:14.960 --> 36:18.960
last few days. Until obviously
speaking to Rosie, who has recently

36:18.960 --> 36:24.800
come in. It's going to be a hard
decision, that is the simplest way
to put it.

36:32.960 --> 36:36.480
It's time for the re-coupling, and
the boys are about to pick the girl

36:36.640 --> 36:40.960
they want to couple up with. The
girl left single will be dumped from

36:40.960 --> 36:43.960
the villa. First up is Wes.

36:45.960 --> 36:48.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I want to couple up with this girl</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">because every single moment</font>

36:48.960 --> 36:52.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I have spent with her has been</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">filled with passion, excitement.</font>

36:52.960 --> 36:55.960
<font color="#FFFF00">We feel mutual about each other, I</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">cannot think of anyone else</font>

36:55.960 --> 36:57.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I would rather spend my time in the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">villa with.</font>

36:57.960 --> 37:03.960
<font color="#FFFF00">The girl I want to couple up with</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">is...Laura.</font>

37:17.320 --> 37:20.960
Next up is Alex who was originally
paired with Samira.

37:20.960 --> 37:23.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I have chosen to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">couple up with this person because</font>

37:23.960 --> 37:31.960
<font color="#FFFF00">they are a kind and warm person to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">be around. I feel so strongly that</font>

37:31.960 --> 37:36.960
<font color="#FFFF00">this person deserves to have the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">opportunity to find love. To find</font>

37:36.960 --> 37:41.960
<font color="#FFFF00">the right girl, guy, sorry, or girl.</font>

37:43.640 --> 37:46.960
<font color="#FFFF00">The girl I want to couple up with</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">is Samira.</font>

37:48.960 --> 37:55.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Love you, Alex.</font>

37:59.960 --> 38:02.960
Next to pick is Jack.

38:02.960 --> 38:07.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I want to couple up with this girl</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">because I think she has got an</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">absolutely amazing personality.</font>

38:08.960 --> 38:13.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I clicked with her straightaway, I</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">have really enjoyed spending time</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with her.</font>

38:13.960 --> 38:17.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I love that she is really kind and</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">she puts other people before</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">herself.</font>

38:17.960 --> 38:20.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I think she is beautiful, inside and</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">out.</font>

38:20.960 --> 38:24.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I fancied her more and more every</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">day since I have been in the villa.</font>

38:24.960 --> 38:27.960
<font color="#FFFF00">We got lost at one point, but we are</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">back on track.</font>

38:31.960 --> 38:33.960
<font color="#FFFF00">The girl I want to couple up with</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">is...</font>

38:39.960 --> 38:41.960
<font color="#FFFF00">..Dani.</font>

39:02.960 --> 39:08.960
Up next is Niall, who was originally
coupled with Kendall before she was
stolen by Adam.

39:09.960 --> 39:15.000
<font color="#00FFFF">The reason I want to couple with</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">this girl, apart from  the fact she</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">is  absolutely stunning,</font>

39:15.160 --> 39:18.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I feel our personalities just</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">get each other.</font>

39:19.800 --> 39:23.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I have been throwing my rod out and</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I have caught my rainbow fish.</font>

39:23.960 --> 39:32.960
<font color="#00FFFF">The girl I want to</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">couple up with is...</font>

39:34.800 --> 39:36.640
<font color="#00FFFF">..Georgia.</font>

39:52.960 --> 39:58.960
Next up is Eyal, who had originally
coupled up with Hayley, but has been
showing interest in Kendall.

40:00.960 --> 40:05.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I want to couple up with this girl</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">because she is beautiful and</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">confident.</font>

40:09.960 --> 40:11.960
<font color="#FFFF00">She has beautiful eyes.</font>

40:16.960 --> 40:20.960
<font color="#FFFF00">And I would genuinely just like to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">get to know her a little bit better.</font>

40:20.960 --> 40:22.960
<font color="#FFFF00">That is why.</font>

40:25.800 --> 40:28.160
<font color="#FFFF00">The girl that I would like to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">couple up with is...</font>

40:34.960 --> 40:36.960
<font color="#FFFF00">..Hayley.</font>

40:36.960 --> 40:40.960
<font color="#00FFFF">That is  the hardest thing I have</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">ever done.</font>

40:50.960 --> 40:55.800
<font color="#00FFFF">Talk about a sweat! </font> It all comes
down to Adam, who has got to choose

40:55.960 --> 40:57.960
between Kendall and Rosie.

41:05.960 --> 41:09.960
<font color="#FFFF00">So I want to couple up with this</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">girl because I think she is</font>

41:09.960 --> 41:14.960
<font color="#FFFF00">gorgeous. I was attracted to her</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">from the first time I saw her.</font>

41:18.960 --> 41:24.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't really think that I gave her</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">enough of a chance. And I do think</font>

41:24.960 --> 41:27.960
<font color="#FFFF00">that I should probably get to know</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">her a little better.</font>

41:31.960 --> 41:34.960
<font color="#FFFF00">So the girl</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that I want to couple up with is... </font>

41:49.960 --> 41:51.960
<font color="#FFFF00">..Rosie.</font>

42:11.960 --> 42:15.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I am gutted.</font>

42:23.960 --> 42:27.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I am so happy that I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">get to stay.</font>

42:27.960 --> 42:31.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Now I am here, Kendall has to leave.</font>

42:31.960 --> 42:37.960
<font color="#00FFFF">She is a classy lady. She has got</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">such a brilliant personality.</font>

42:37.960 --> 42:41.960
<font color="#00FFFF">She is marriage material. Why her ex</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">did not marry her, I will never</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">know.</font>

42:41.960 --> 42:48.960
<font color="#FFFF00">That was not an easy decision. </font><font color="#11FF11"> It's</font>
<font color="#11FF11">fine, don't feel like you have to</font>
<font color="#11FF11">explain yourself.</font>

42:48.960 --> 42:56.160
<font color="#11FF11">I had a gut feeling. Don't</font>
<font color="#11FF11">worry about it.</font>

43:01.960 --> 43:06.160
<font color="#FFFF00">Making the decision during the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">re-coupling was extremely difficult</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">for me.</font>

43:06.320 --> 43:12.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I care about Kendall and how she</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">feels, but I cannot see me and</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Kendall ever moving forward.</font>

43:12.960 --> 43:16.960
<font color="#FFFF00">It was the right decision and the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">decision I had to make.</font>

43:18.960 --> 43:26.640
<font color="#00FFFF">I am so glad I followed my gut</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">with him. That is one thing I can</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">say about it.</font>

43:26.800 --> 43:32.960
<font color="#FFFF00">It is just a shit situation,</font>

43:32.960 --> 43:37.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Kendall sleeps in the bed next to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">me. Tomorrow I will wake up</font>

43:37.960 --> 43:44.960
<font color="#FFFF00">and she will not be there. When</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">someone that you click with from the</font>

43:44.960 --> 43:48.960
<font color="#FFFF00">word go has gone out the villa.</font>

43:53.960 --> 43:59.960
<font color="#00FFFF">What are you going to miss the most?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">You girls.</font>

43:59.960 --> 44:04.960
<font color="#11FF11">I don't think she is sad to leave</font>
<font color="#11FF11">the villa, I think she is sad</font>

44:04.960 --> 44:09.960
<font color="#11FF11">that it did not work out with Adam.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">If that is the case, it is not her</font>

44:09.960 --> 44:15.960
<font color="#11FF11">time to be here. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> You have had the</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">best time.</font>

44:15.960 --> 44:18.960
<font color="#FFFF00">We will see you when we get out.</font>

44:22.640 --> 44:26.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I was really enjoying getting to</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">know Kendall, I felt like there</font>

44:26.960 --> 44:31.960
<font color="#00FFFF">was something potentially there, I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">would have liked to get to know her</font>

44:31.960 --> 44:33.960
<font color="#00FFFF">more. I will definitely miss her.</font>

44:41.960 --> 44:46.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I am gutted to be dumped from the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">villa first. Quite gutting.</font>

44:46.960 --> 44:53.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I feel like maybe I have not had my</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">chance to find somebody.</font>

44:53.960 --> 44:57.960
<font color="#FFFF00">The hardest</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">thing I have found is understanding</font>

44:57.960 --> 45:04.960
<font color="#FFFF00">my situation. Since coming out of my</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">relationship, I have only dated one</font>

45:04.960 --> 45:09.960
<font color="#FFFF00">person. I knew I would find it</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">harder than other people maybe.</font>

45:12.960 --> 45:20.960
On Sunday night...not one, not two,
but three new islanders enter the
villa.

45:20.960 --> 45:23.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I am Charlie, I am 23. I am</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">coming to Love Island</font>

45:23.960 --> 45:32.960
<font color="#FFFF00">because I am ready to find the one</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and have some fun in the sun. I am</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">not sure what my type is .</font>

45:32.960 --> 45:36.960
<font color="#00FFFF">I am Meghan, I am 24 from Essex. I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">get a lot of attention from</font>

45:36.960 --> 45:40.640
<font color="#00FFFF">guys, but it always seems to be the</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">wrong ones. I have been single for</font>

45:40.800 --> 45:44.160
<font color="#00FFFF">two years, been unlucky in love, but</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm looking for the one.</font>

45:44.320 --> 45:52.960
<font color="#11FF11">I'm Josh, I'm from London. I am</font>
<font color="#11FF11">going to go into the villa and I am</font>
<font color="#11FF11">looking for love.</font>

45:52.960 --> 45:55.960
<font color="#11FF11">If I fancy a girl in the villa and</font>
<font color="#11FF11">she is with someone else,</font>

45:55.960 --> 45:57.960
<font color="#11FF11">let's play the game. It is Love</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Island.</font>

45:57.960 --> 46:00.960
Get ready for a villa meltdown.
