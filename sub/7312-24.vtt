17:25.565 --> 17:27.608
Well, he should know.That's what I thought.

17:27.652 --> 17:28.913
Location?

17:28.956 --> 17:30.391
Northrop Hotel, 27th and M.

17:30.434 --> 17:32.521
She went there to bring
Ray back to her place.

17:32.565 --> 17:34.217
Thought it would
be safer.

17:34.260 --> 17:36.347
Is there a problem?The problem is, I
haven't checked in yet.

17:36.391 --> 17:39.521
I was on assignment. I just got
back to D.C. an hour ago.

17:39.565 --> 17:41.086
Where is Ziva?I really don't know, sir.

17:41.130 --> 17:42.043
TONY:
Can't find her.

17:42.086 --> 17:43.739
Tried her home and cell.

17:43.782 --> 17:45.695
I knew I shouldn't have
let her go alone.

17:45.739 --> 17:48.086
This is not your responsibility.

17:48.130 --> 17:49.869
Kort lied.No, he didn't.

17:49.913 --> 17:51.869
His information
was accurate.

17:51.913 --> 17:53.347
Who else had access to your
travel plans, Cruz?

17:53.391 --> 17:55.956
My itinerary's classified, sir.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.478
Classified never stopped
Cobb before.

17:57.521 --> 17:58.956
What if he
got there first?

17:59.000 --> 18:00.260
DiNozzo, BOLO
out on Ziva.

18:00.304 --> 18:01.739
McGee, get me Kort.

18:01.782 --> 18:03.304
Boss, he's already
in the building.

18:07.956 --> 18:11.521
It's been a long time,
Mr. Secretary.

18:11.565 --> 18:15.086
We weren't supposed
to see each other again.

18:15.130 --> 18:16.608
Per your request.

18:16.652 --> 18:19.608
I certainly wish
that were the case.

18:19.652 --> 18:21.913
Oh, Leon, do we have to
talk about this again?

18:21.956 --> 18:24.521
Am I boring you, Kort?

18:24.565 --> 18:26.652
You know I have a
limited attention span.

18:26.695 --> 18:31.130
Well, let me see if I can
keep it interesting for you.

18:31.173 --> 18:34.434
Here's what your boy Cobb
just did to one of my men.

18:34.478 --> 18:36.434
I trained him
to kill, Director.

18:36.478 --> 18:38.130
Selection is entirely
his decision.

18:38.173 --> 18:39.478
Do you remember

18:39.521 --> 18:41.000
when this operation
was conceived?

18:41.043 --> 18:43.391
Like it was yesterday.

18:43.434 --> 18:46.086
Your clever notion,
I believe.

18:46.130 --> 18:48.217
Scribbled on a note pad

18:48.260 --> 18:50.521
during your days
at the war college.

18:50.565 --> 18:51.521
Who knew

18:51.565 --> 18:54.043
it would become
a joint venture

18:54.086 --> 18:55.956
between the Navy
and the CIA?

18:56.000 --> 18:58.347
It was flawed from the get-go.
It should have been aborted.

18:58.391 --> 18:59.565
It was conceptually brilliant.

18:59.608 --> 19:02.869
The results were
generally positive.

19:02.913 --> 19:05.478
Except Kort lost control
of one of his men.

19:05.521 --> 19:06.826
It wasn't from
lack of trying.

19:06.869 --> 19:09.565
Cobb was strong-willed.

19:09.608 --> 19:11.478
Got a taste for killing.

19:11.521 --> 19:13.173
You pushed him.

19:13.217 --> 19:15.695
You used him on assignments
outside of the program.

19:15.739 --> 19:17.043
With approval.

19:17.086 --> 19:19.000
Those who
needed to know

19:19.043 --> 19:20.304
did.

19:20.347 --> 19:22.652
And now somebody has
to take the heat.

19:22.695 --> 19:25.173
Special Agents Barrett and Gibbs
have failed to stop him.

19:25.217 --> 19:26.608
You can't blame them.

19:26.652 --> 19:29.956
Mr. Secretary,

19:30.000 --> 19:31.521
for once the weight

19:31.565 --> 19:34.565
does not fall on the bottom
of the pyramid.

19:34.608 --> 19:36.869
This operation
was your call.

19:36.913 --> 19:37.782
Accept it.

19:41.086 --> 19:44.000
Pam, is he in here?

19:44.043 --> 19:45.739
Sir, we're in SCIF mode.
You don't have clearance.

19:45.782 --> 19:48.130
[alarm beeping]

19:48.173 --> 19:49.304
Excuse me.

19:52.695 --> 19:54.086
Leon.

19:54.130 --> 19:55.608
We need to talk.

19:55.652 --> 19:56.956
Not now, Gibbs.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.695
Is Trent Kort in there with you?

19:58.739 --> 20:03.956
Agent Gibbs, this meeting
requires access beyond
your need to know.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.826
I need to know if he sent one
of my people into a trap.

20:06.869 --> 20:08.521
Ziva went to meet Ray Cruz

20:08.565 --> 20:10.043
at his hotel,
and he wasn't there yet.

20:10.086 --> 20:11.956
And now she's missing.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.521
Gibbs, all I did was provide
your team with Cruz's location.

20:15.565 --> 20:17.391
Well, we think Cobb got her.

20:17.434 --> 20:18.956
You think I sent her
in there on purpose?

20:19.000 --> 20:20.869
To gain what, exactly?

20:20.913 --> 20:22.130
If she gets hurt,

20:22.173 --> 20:24.608
you answer to me.

20:26.086 --> 20:28.826
Is he threatening me, Director?

20:28.869 --> 20:30.347
If he wasn't,

20:30.391 --> 20:32.260
I am.

20:34.565 --> 20:36.782
What do you mean the security
camera's not working?

20:36.826 --> 20:39.260
I told you, Tony, the system's
down all over the hotel.

20:39.304 --> 20:41.086
It has been for days.Isn't that illegal?

20:41.130 --> 20:43.043
Same M.O. No fingerprints.

20:43.086 --> 20:44.695
The place has been
wiped clean.

20:44.739 --> 20:48.173
How could she just walk out
of here and nobody notices?

20:48.217 --> 20:50.173
Tony.

20:50.217 --> 20:52.086
Sorry.

20:52.130 --> 20:53.739
We're all worried
about Ziva.

20:53.782 --> 20:55.521
I know.

20:55.565 --> 20:58.173
It's just different
for some of us.

20:58.217 --> 20:59.434
[knocking]

21:04.521 --> 21:06.478
I think you people
are looking for me.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.304
BARRETT:
This isn't right.

21:36.347 --> 21:37.608
It's too easy.

21:37.652 --> 21:40.130
He knows where Ziva is.

21:40.173 --> 21:41.521
There's nothing
easy about it.

21:41.565 --> 21:43.695
Cobb's playing us.

21:43.739 --> 21:46.304
Playing Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

21:46.347 --> 21:48.000
Guy must have
a death wish.

21:48.043 --> 21:50.043
What does he want?

21:50.086 --> 21:51.304
Rule 16:

21:51.347 --> 21:52.956
If someone thinks they
have the upper hand,

21:53.000 --> 21:55.565
break it.

21:55.608 --> 21:57.826
[door opens]

21:57.869 --> 21:58.826
[door closes]

22:12.521 --> 22:14.478
[chuckles]

22:14.521 --> 22:17.478
Something funny?

22:17.521 --> 22:19.565
I mean, you're so confident.

22:19.608 --> 22:21.000
So proud.

22:21.043 --> 22:24.434
Nothing to be proud of.
You gave yourself up.

22:24.478 --> 22:27.304
Why?

22:27.347 --> 22:29.869
Well, because most
of my work is done.

22:29.913 --> 22:31.913
Most?

22:31.956 --> 22:34.913
Agent Gibbs, are you incapable
of savoring a moment?

22:34.956 --> 22:38.565
Nothing to savor. Yet.

22:38.608 --> 22:41.652
One of my team
is still missing.

22:43.826 --> 22:45.695
Where is she?

22:49.086 --> 22:51.000
It's time to
put Samson down.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.086
You don't know
about Samson, do you?

22:57.130 --> 22:59.130
[chuckles]

22:59.173 --> 23:02.478
Surely Agent Barrett
wrote about him in that,

23:02.521 --> 23:05.347
that psych profile she
holds so near and dear?

23:05.391 --> 23:07.434
I'm listening.

23:10.652 --> 23:15.826
Once there was a boy whose
father was in the Navy.

23:15.869 --> 23:22.000
He was a captain, with enough
bravery and determination

23:22.043 --> 23:25.826
to make up for his
son's obvious shortcomings.

23:25.869 --> 23:30.304
One day, the young man turned
to the captain for help.

23:30.347 --> 23:32.521
You see, his aging horse,
Samson, was sick,

23:32.565 --> 23:34.260
and a decision
needed to be made.

23:34.304 --> 23:37.739
Now, the boy knew that
a visit from the vet

23:37.782 --> 23:39.956
meant putting
the animal down.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.826
Which was the right
and humane thing to do.

23:43.869 --> 23:48.652
But what kind of lesson would
that be for the boy to learn?

23:48.695 --> 23:51.391
So the captain
drew his sidearm.

23:51.434 --> 23:56.304
Fired... point blank.

23:58.956 --> 24:02.434
Put poor Samson
out of his misery.

24:02.478 --> 24:05.565
Would you like me to put you
out of your misery, Cobb?

24:05.608 --> 24:08.521
Your agent is still
out there, Gibbs.

24:12.782 --> 24:15.391
Now, what kind of
lesson would you learn

24:15.434 --> 24:17.695
if my actions were humane?

24:20.347 --> 24:22.739
You failed as a Navy officer.

24:22.782 --> 24:25.173
You were an embarrassment
to the CIA.

24:25.217 --> 24:28.565
A disappointment
to your dad.

24:28.608 --> 24:31.086
And you want to
teach me a lesson?

24:33.739 --> 24:35.739
Where is she?

24:39.521 --> 24:42.826
Who's holding the sidearm now?

24:48.347 --> 24:50.826
Tell me what you know.

24:54.695 --> 24:57.260
[sighs] Kort oversaw
two divisions.

24:57.304 --> 25:00.086
The first one was
a legitimate covert squad

25:00.130 --> 25:02.130
operating under the
auspices of the Agency.

25:02.173 --> 25:04.304
Operation Frankenstein.

25:04.347 --> 25:06.000
Now, the second one

25:06.043 --> 25:08.304
was a team designed for,
uh, the private sector.

25:08.347 --> 25:09.478
Hit men.

25:09.521 --> 25:11.391
Guns for hire.

25:11.434 --> 25:13.304
Used mostly by rich,
foreign politicos

25:13.347 --> 25:15.130
with targets on their
backs, you understand?

25:15.173 --> 25:16.695
Who collected the profits?

25:16.739 --> 25:18.086
I can't tell you that.

25:18.130 --> 25:19.478
What I will tell you is that

25:19.521 --> 25:22.391
Kort skimmed enough
off the top to retire.

25:22.434 --> 25:25.347
And do you think Cobb would have
turned himself in the way he did

25:25.391 --> 25:28.521
unless he was after
something very specific?

25:28.565 --> 25:31.347
Something he could only
find right here at NCIS?

25:41.565 --> 25:43.043
Have you gone bloody mad?!

25:43.086 --> 25:45.434
What does Cobb really want?

25:45.478 --> 25:47.956
You have no idea
how high this goes.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.086
I know all about
Operation Frankenstein.

25:50.130 --> 25:52.521
You don't know anything.

25:52.565 --> 25:56.173
Certain people had a lot
to gain from this project.

25:56.217 --> 25:57.521
I need to find Ziva.

25:57.565 --> 26:01.130
Stop looking for
a straight line, DiNozzo!

26:01.173 --> 26:04.304
If this were a chess game,
think four moves ahead.

26:04.347 --> 26:06.826
It's all about the checkmate.

26:06.869 --> 26:09.956
He's clever that way.

26:15.739 --> 26:17.565
Abbs? You okay?

26:19.565 --> 26:22.086
The blood on Cobb's hands...

26:22.130 --> 26:23.565
It's Ziva's.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.695
It does not mean
that she's gone.

26:28.739 --> 26:31.521
You find anything
on Cobb's clothes?

26:31.565 --> 26:32.826
Um...

26:32.869 --> 26:37.260
There's concrete dust
from the ground

26:37.304 --> 26:39.478
where Cade and
Levin were shot...

26:39.521 --> 26:40.913
that's no big surprise.

26:40.956 --> 26:45.347
But I found some weird trace
elements on his pants.

26:45.391 --> 26:48.782
There was dead bluegrass,
and sheet-metal rust

26:48.826 --> 26:52.956
and some homeopathic oils.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.695
It was, uh, arnica, and
butcher's broom and bitterwort.

26:55.739 --> 26:57.956
Bitterwort?

26:58.000 --> 26:59.217
Yeah.

26:59.260 --> 27:00.956
Also known as gentian.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.217
It aids in muscle aches
in older people.

27:03.260 --> 27:05.913
What if they weren't people?

27:08.391 --> 27:10.739
Remember: positive.

27:15.956 --> 27:17.826
Start talking, McGee.

27:17.869 --> 27:19.478
Abby forwarded
the chemical breakdowns

27:19.521 --> 27:20.956
she found on Cobb's clothing.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.652
Any link to
a horse named Samson?

27:22.695 --> 27:25.434
McGEE: All the oils are used in
over-the-counter liniments.

27:25.478 --> 27:27.608
For horses to keep their
muscles limber...
Yeah.

27:27.652 --> 27:29.652
GIBBS:
Yeah, McGee. I know
what they are.

27:29.695 --> 27:32.347
Pull up location of the
Cobb family farm in Maryland.

27:32.391 --> 27:35.434
McGEE:
Captain Lowell Cobb bought the
horse farm in Burtonsville

27:35.478 --> 27:37.391
22 years ago.

27:37.434 --> 27:39.652
When he died, he and Jonas
hadn't spoken in years.

27:39.695 --> 27:42.956
The land fell into disarray
and was auctioned off later.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.652
Go. Find DiNozzo.

27:44.695 --> 27:45.956
And Ray Cruz.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.521
You think Ziva's there?

27:47.565 --> 27:49.782
Yeah. You can bet
the farm on it.

27:49.826 --> 27:52.608
Road trip.
If you don't mind,
Gibbs, I'd like to come.

27:52.652 --> 27:54.130
Got orders from upstairs.
They want you benched.

27:54.173 --> 27:55.521
Who?

27:56.956 --> 27:59.608
I'm not supposed
to talk about it.

27:59.652 --> 28:01.260
Talk about what, Gibbs?

28:05.000 --> 28:07.478
I know that your
uncle is SECNAV.

28:07.521 --> 28:11.130
I have since day one.

28:11.173 --> 28:14.217
That's supposed to
be confidential.

28:14.260 --> 28:16.391
I gotta know my
team, Barrett.

28:18.521 --> 28:20.913
Is there anything else
you want to tell me?

28:20.956 --> 28:22.608
With all due respect,

28:22.652 --> 28:26.086
I've worked hard to get here.

28:26.130 --> 28:27.695
I earned Rota.

28:27.739 --> 28:29.956
And my personal relationship
to the Secretary

28:30.000 --> 28:31.347
had nothing to do with it.

28:31.391 --> 28:33.608
I never said it did.

28:38.043 --> 28:39.956
RAY:
All clear!
TONY:
Nothing here, boss.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.608
McGEE:
Looks totally abandoned.

28:48.913 --> 28:52.347
[toy cymbals crashing,
monkey hooting]

28:55.173 --> 28:57.217
Heads up...

29:07.521 --> 29:09.869
[muffled yelling]

29:09.913 --> 29:11.043
RAY:
Ziva...

29:11.086 --> 29:12.347
You all right?

29:12.391 --> 29:14.173
I'm all right.

29:14.217 --> 29:16.739
ZIVA:
Hiding me is a decoy, Gibbs.
