WEBVTT

00:11.761 --> 00:13.596
[male voice] Almost there, Alyssa.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.891
Three out of the four sections.

00:20.437 --> 00:21.771
There's no cover.

00:24.190 --> 00:27.902
I present you with the single
most powerful incantation ever recorded

00:27.986 --> 00:29.404
and you focus on the binding?

00:29.487 --> 00:31.031
I'm sorry, Magus.

00:31.656 --> 00:32.824
You're right. It's...

00:32.907 --> 00:35.035
It's an amazing feat.

00:35.452 --> 00:38.705
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations to us both.

00:39.539 --> 00:42.250
We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you,
and I won't forget that.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.049
Even in its incomplete form...

00:51.009 --> 00:52.260
I've learned so much.

00:52.927 --> 00:55.638
The book wants to be whole,
it wants to be one.

00:55.722 --> 00:58.641
It's been looking for me
as much as I've been looking for it.

00:59.309 --> 01:00.894
You talk about it like it's alive.

01:00.977 --> 01:02.979
It is, in its own way.

01:03.438 --> 01:05.774
And once I pledge my loyalty
to the book...

01:07.233 --> 01:08.860
it will make itself whole.

01:16.868 --> 01:17.911
[Alyssa gasps]

01:21.122 --> 01:23.792
[Edward speaking in Latin]

01:26.920 --> 01:28.713
It's a binding contract.

01:29.506 --> 01:30.965
I need you to be the witness.

01:32.509 --> 01:35.887
[stuttering] You want me to...
to cut off my finger?

01:37.097 --> 01:38.515
Your thumbprint will do.

01:40.725 --> 01:41.810
Oh.

01:43.895 --> 01:45.688
[blade cutting]

01:49.609 --> 01:52.070
Is this a contract with the Vade Maecum

01:52.779 --> 01:53.780
or with you?

01:53.863 --> 01:54.781
Both.

01:56.491 --> 01:57.575
[sighs]

02:01.287 --> 02:03.289
[faint ringing]

02:04.207 --> 02:05.667
[Edward] And so we begin.

02:05.834 --> 02:09.045
The Vade Maecum will draw
the missing piece to it like a magnet.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.089
The rest of the book can be summoned
from anywhere,

02:11.172 --> 02:12.340
so keep your eyes open.

02:12.966 --> 02:13.800
I will.

02:14.676 --> 02:15.677
I know you will.

02:23.726 --> 02:24.936
[high-pitched ringing]

02:25.019 --> 02:27.522
-[Jack groans]
-[Randall groans]

02:30.525 --> 02:33.403
-Well, that was intense.
-It's probably Edward.

02:33.486 --> 02:34.445
And Alyssa,

02:34.946 --> 02:38.074
off making sweet,
sweet magic together somewhere.

02:44.205 --> 02:46.040
I meant that in a literal sense.

02:46.124 --> 02:48.251
I don't want to talk about this
anymore, okay?

02:51.880 --> 02:52.964
[Jack] Mm.

02:54.841 --> 02:55.717
[gasps]

02:57.093 --> 03:00.763
Know what? I just don't understand why
she can't see what a monster he is!

03:00.847 --> 03:02.515
[Hamish] Because your monster is her idol.

03:02.599 --> 03:05.977
You can't tear someone's idol down
for them, they have to do that themselves.

03:06.060 --> 03:08.229
-The Hamster's right.
-Don't call me that.

03:08.521 --> 03:11.107
I'm no fan of Coventry's, but objectively,

03:11.191 --> 03:13.318
he does have a high bang-ability factor.

03:13.401 --> 03:16.279
-You're talking about my girlfriend.
-Ex-girlfriend.

03:16.362 --> 03:18.823
-And my dad.
-[Lilith] He's not your dad.

03:18.907 --> 03:21.743
He's some guy who dumped his seed
into your mom and took off.

03:21.826 --> 03:24.037
-Whoa!
-You got a better way to describe it?

03:24.120 --> 03:25.997
-Biological father?
-[Lilith] Mm.

03:26.748 --> 03:27.707
Sure, that works.

03:29.667 --> 03:32.295
Maybe Alyssa's right
about you quitting The Order.

03:32.378 --> 03:35.215
It's not that easy. Remember what happened
to Lilith and her memory?

03:35.632 --> 03:37.634
-I don't.
-If I'm lucky, that's all they'll take.

03:37.717 --> 03:40.094
Knights, we have a new project.

03:40.386 --> 03:43.765
Find a way to restore Jack's memory.
We can test it out on Lilith.

03:43.932 --> 03:46.851
-I don't want my memory back.
-Lil, it would be so cool.

03:46.976 --> 03:49.854
What if you find out you can shred
the electric guitar?

03:49.938 --> 03:52.899
We could start a band.
Randall and the Werewolves.

03:53.024 --> 03:56.194
-Why don't I get top billing?
-If you have to ask, that's why.

03:56.277 --> 03:57.779
[Lilith] I can deal with the shredding.

03:57.862 --> 04:01.032
I just don't want to live in any world
where I was besties with Alyssa Drake.

04:01.407 --> 04:07.121
-[ringing resumes]
-[all groan]

04:07.205 --> 04:10.541
-That was annoying.
-And longer than usual.

04:10.959 --> 04:13.461
-Maybe we should check that out?
-[Hamish] It's been a long night.

04:13.544 --> 04:15.672
Get some rest.
Whatever it is, it can wait.

04:27.517 --> 04:29.435
Go inside and pack. You're done here.

04:29.769 --> 04:30.645
No.

04:31.145 --> 04:34.315
-This isn't a debate.
-You're right. I'm staying.

04:36.693 --> 04:37.944
We had a plan.

04:39.070 --> 04:42.365
-And it was a good one.
-No, it was a long shot, Pops, okay?

04:42.448 --> 04:45.410
And now you're letting some girl
fuck it all up.

04:46.035 --> 04:47.370
No, we broke up.

04:50.373 --> 04:52.625
Oh. Okay, let's get some breakfast.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.460
-Maybe we can still salvage this mess.
-Pops!

04:56.754 --> 05:01.968
My life is really complicated right now,
and I'm trying to sort some stuff out.

05:02.051 --> 05:04.846
You're eighteen.
How complicated can your life be?

05:08.766 --> 05:10.727
-Do you really want to know?
-Yeah.

05:11.269 --> 05:12.854
Why don't you show me, champ?

05:12.937 --> 05:16.107
Show me and your mother just how complic--

05:17.775 --> 05:19.777
[Jack snarls]

05:19.902 --> 05:21.988
What the ever-loving fuck?

05:28.119 --> 05:31.331
-What have they done to you?
-The Order didn't do anything, Pops.

05:31.706 --> 05:33.624
Remember that werewolf I was hunting?

05:33.708 --> 05:36.294
Well, it turns out he's part
of another secret society,

05:36.377 --> 05:37.670
The Knights of St. Christopher,

05:37.754 --> 05:40.548
and I've basically been working
as a double agent for them.

05:40.631 --> 05:42.467
Okay? Is that complicated enough for you?

05:43.051 --> 05:44.969
You'd rather fight The Order with...

05:46.012 --> 05:49.057
a bunch of werewolves
than your own flesh and blood?

05:49.140 --> 05:50.850
That's your take-away from this?

05:52.060 --> 05:54.645
How does that even matter,
as long as we take down Coventry?

05:55.938 --> 05:56.773
Right?

05:57.690 --> 05:58.524
Yeah.

06:02.528 --> 06:03.446
Well, then...

06:05.907 --> 06:07.784
Do you at least have a plan?

06:08.284 --> 06:10.119
Coventry is searching for something.

06:11.079 --> 06:13.289
And I'm trying to figure out what it is.

06:14.791 --> 06:15.833
[laughs]

06:15.917 --> 06:18.669
God, unbelievable.

06:20.546 --> 06:22.590
You-- You've got fangs,

06:23.257 --> 06:24.509
you've got claws...

06:27.345 --> 06:28.930
and you still don't know what to do.

06:30.598 --> 06:32.934
-What the hell's wrong with you?
-I don't know, Pete.

06:33.434 --> 06:35.311
Maybe I don't want to kill people.

06:36.437 --> 06:39.315
Maybe I'm fucking tired
of everyone else telling me what to do.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.945
Yeah... I guess it's your choice.

06:47.698 --> 06:49.367
Nothing was ever my choice.

06:53.496 --> 06:55.206
[Vera] Hemmings is dead.

06:55.456 --> 06:58.751
There was a fire at his lab.

06:59.377 --> 07:00.253
[sighs]

07:00.336 --> 07:02.338
At least he died doing what he loved.

07:03.297 --> 07:04.966
[Vera] The fire was magical

07:05.049 --> 07:08.344
and used to cover up the fact
that he was murdered by werewolves.

07:10.012 --> 07:11.264
-Oh.
-It also...

07:12.014 --> 07:16.686
destroyed several manuscripts
and artifacts from this reliquary.

07:16.769 --> 07:19.021
Items Hemmings took without my permission.

07:19.313 --> 07:21.482
And there's only one way
he could've done that.

07:21.941 --> 07:22.775
Magic.

07:23.484 --> 07:25.486
Or Edward granted him access.

07:26.571 --> 07:28.322
Hemmings was working for the Grand Magus?

07:28.406 --> 07:29.782
What do you think he was doing?

07:30.241 --> 07:31.993
-[door hinges creak]
-I'll tell you.

07:32.869 --> 07:35.580
Hemmings was trying to protect the temple

07:36.372 --> 07:37.331
and its disciples.

07:38.374 --> 07:42.462
And yes, I empowered him
without consulting the Gnostic Council.

07:42.837 --> 07:44.172
Time was of essence.

07:44.547 --> 07:45.923
It's a phone call.

07:46.007 --> 07:49.302
With a conference line,
and someone's always late.

07:50.928 --> 07:51.888
He's not wrong.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.850
We have a werewolf problem
that won't go away.

07:55.933 --> 07:57.935
So, you admit that you knew about it.

07:58.019 --> 08:00.313
Well, you make it seem like
I have something to answer for.

08:00.396 --> 08:03.191
You weren't capable of dealing
with the situation,

08:03.274 --> 08:05.193
so I asked Hemmings to find a way.

08:05.943 --> 08:07.653
[Kepler] That does sound reasonable, Vera.

08:08.696 --> 08:12.783
The Gnostic Council exists
for the welfare of the entire Order.

08:12.867 --> 08:13.910
Oh, absolutely.

08:14.577 --> 08:16.287
Which is why I'm here to tell you

08:16.454 --> 08:20.625
that I have initiated the Vade Maecum
Infernal as approved by this Council.

08:21.292 --> 08:23.503
-You've restored the book?
-Almost.

08:24.128 --> 08:28.758
As it turns out, the Vade Maecum
is all that I need to destroy these pests.

08:29.884 --> 08:30.968
And until then?

08:31.844 --> 08:33.137
We need to do everything we can

08:33.221 --> 08:35.139
to keep the werewolves away
from the temple.

08:35.348 --> 08:38.017
You were right, Kepler,
the book attracts them.

08:38.768 --> 08:40.061
It's time for action.

08:40.603 --> 08:42.438
I want to build our new future.

08:42.897 --> 08:44.607
I trust I have the Council's support.

08:44.941 --> 08:45.900
Of course.

08:46.734 --> 08:49.445
The incantation
will be our crowning achievement.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.322
I know.

09:02.333 --> 09:04.669
I thought you were working
on recovered memory spells.

09:04.794 --> 09:05.795
[Randall] We did.

09:06.587 --> 09:07.672
Now, we're relaxing.

09:07.755 --> 09:08.798
A previous Tundra,

09:08.881 --> 09:11.717
the most brilliant of the Knights,
wrote about it in one of the journals

09:11.801 --> 09:15.054
-and this Tundra found it.
-[Randall] So, now you can quit,

09:15.513 --> 09:17.974
get wiped, and then we can reboot you.

09:19.141 --> 09:21.102
-You're sure it works?
-[glass shatters]

09:21.978 --> 09:25.314
-It worked on Lilith.
<i>-</i>[Lilith] We told each other everything!

09:25.398 --> 09:28.442
Mm, she's particularly enjoying
the Alyssa memories.

09:29.569 --> 09:30.528
I'm going to do it.

09:31.487 --> 09:34.657
-You're kicking magic to the curb?
-I am quitting The Order.

09:35.116 --> 09:35.950
It's about time.

09:36.033 --> 09:37.159
[Lilith screams upstairs]

09:38.202 --> 09:40.329
[Lilith] I told her everything!

09:40.955 --> 09:43.541
We braided each other's hair!

09:47.003 --> 09:49.964
It's funny, I always thought the temple
was under the reference library

09:50.047 --> 09:52.425
instead of this haunted house,

09:52.508 --> 09:55.386
which makes more sense,
you know, metaphorically.

09:57.179 --> 09:59.890
I remember when getting into The Order
was all I ever wanted.

10:02.768 --> 10:04.353
Now, I'm just walking away from it.

10:05.813 --> 10:07.106
Priorities change.

10:09.191 --> 10:10.318
Yeah, I guess.

10:12.486 --> 10:14.947
Now, get in there and lose your mind.

10:15.072 --> 10:17.158
-[Randall laughs]
-[Jack sighs]

10:17.241 --> 10:19.452
Don't worry. I've got your back.

10:31.339 --> 10:33.424
-What's going on?
-Some Armageddon spell.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.301
[sighs]

10:35.384 --> 10:37.553
-Are you kidding me?
-[Brandon] I'm editorializing.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.681
It's something huge and world-changing.

10:41.682 --> 10:42.558
We're destroying

10:43.059 --> 10:45.311
-the Fatty Mason Internal.
-The Fatty what?

10:46.228 --> 10:47.480
Is this for the Grand Magus?

10:47.563 --> 10:49.732
Would I be down on my hands and knees
for anyone else?

10:49.815 --> 10:51.400
Twenty bucks says yes.

10:52.401 --> 10:53.277
[Alyssa] Brandon?

10:54.320 --> 10:56.155
Have you finished? Is it immaculate?

10:56.322 --> 10:57.406
Yes, Medicum.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.283
Okay. Then get changed, it's time.

11:00.159 --> 11:02.161
[fire crackling, indistinct chatter]

11:02.578 --> 11:04.413
Everyone get dressed. Now.

11:04.872 --> 11:06.082
[all] Yes, Medicum.

11:11.295 --> 11:12.922
You can't be here right now.

11:13.714 --> 11:16.801
You should be happy to see me.
I'm here to get hit with the amnesia dust.

11:18.594 --> 11:20.346
You want to quit? Right now?

11:20.429 --> 11:23.432
Yeah. Anything to help me forget
what I saw last night.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.017
[high-pitched ringing starts]

11:27.812 --> 11:29.063
What are you doing in there?

11:30.398 --> 11:32.692
[ringing]

11:34.235 --> 11:35.945
You'll contaminate the ceremony.

11:36.028 --> 11:37.071
[ringing stops]

11:37.154 --> 11:39.865
All this for Edward? The Fatty Mason?

11:40.032 --> 11:41.450
[Alyssa] It's called the Vade Maecum.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.703
-What's that?
-What did you see last night?

11:43.869 --> 11:46.414
You,
climbing into Coventry's midlife crisis.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.333
Why don't you say what you're thinking.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.168
[ringing resumes]

11:51.252 --> 11:52.211
[Alyssa] Go ahead.

11:54.255 --> 11:56.632
[ringing continues]

12:01.178 --> 12:04.432
My mother is dead because of your...

12:06.767 --> 12:07.935
your hero.

12:08.602 --> 12:09.687
He's my mentor.

12:09.770 --> 12:10.771
Oh, fuck, come on.

12:11.647 --> 12:13.482
And fuck you for thinking anything else.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.901
Well, we both get what we want
if you do what I ask.

12:17.445 --> 12:19.739
And trust me, it'll be the last thing
I'll ever ask you for.

12:20.448 --> 12:21.741
Why don't you just leave now?

12:21.907 --> 12:23.868
You'll be kicked out
for skipping the ceremony.

12:23.951 --> 12:26.370
Win-win for both of us,
so I think that you should--

12:27.329 --> 12:28.164
Jack.

12:28.247 --> 12:30.499
[ringing resumes]

12:30.583 --> 12:31.500
Jack!

12:31.625 --> 12:35.296
[ringing continues]

12:38.174 --> 12:40.718
[ringing continues]

12:43.304 --> 12:45.598
[Alyssa] Jack, you can't go... Jack!

12:45.681 --> 12:46.891
[ringing fades]

12:48.017 --> 12:49.602
[Jack] It's like it stung me.

12:50.978 --> 12:52.521
[Alyssa] You need to get out of here.

12:52.980 --> 12:53.981
Right now.

12:54.064 --> 12:55.941
[female voice]
Is everything all right, Alyssa?

12:58.360 --> 12:59.445
[Gabby] Alyssa?

13:00.821 --> 13:02.323
You're the worst Acolyte ever!

13:02.448 --> 13:04.325
First, you're late,
then you tell me you're sick?

13:04.408 --> 13:06.786
-Pretend that you're sick.
-Oh, that won't be hard.

13:07.870 --> 13:09.121
[Alyssa] What were you thinking?

13:09.205 --> 13:11.207
You could've sneezed on the altar
in an incantation!

13:11.290 --> 13:12.458
You'd ruin everything!

13:16.420 --> 13:17.338
[Alyssa] Randall!

13:18.297 --> 13:19.381
Something's wrong.

13:19.924 --> 13:22.802
Did you wipe too much of his memory?
Does he think he's a baby?

13:23.260 --> 13:24.303
-Hey.
-[Jack] No.

13:24.386 --> 13:25.805
[Randall] What happened to you?

13:26.514 --> 13:28.557
It's Silverback. Something's wrong.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.602
-He's fighting me.
-You need to get him out of here. Hurry!

13:37.233 --> 13:38.651
Have I taught you nothing?

13:39.026 --> 13:40.361
I'm drinking to forget.

13:40.486 --> 13:42.071
At least let me garnish it.

13:42.154 --> 13:43.656
[door crashes open]

13:43.781 --> 13:47.034
Guys, something's wrong.
Something's wrong with Jack.

13:47.117 --> 13:48.661
[Jack] My skin, it's on fire.

13:48.744 --> 13:50.037
[Jack gasps]

13:52.081 --> 13:54.208
[Randall] Guys, guys, look.

13:54.458 --> 13:55.334
[Jack yells]

13:55.417 --> 13:56.460
Sorry.

13:56.919 --> 13:58.796
-[Jack groans]
-[ripping]

13:58.879 --> 14:00.214
[Randall] That's Silverback.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.467
Who did this to him?
Was it that bitch, Alyssa?

14:04.134 --> 14:05.219
Whom I loved, once.

14:07.805 --> 14:09.223
Like a sister, you perverts.

14:11.642 --> 14:13.227
What were they doing at that temple?

14:13.310 --> 14:17.606
They're preparing for something
called the... the Vade Maecum.

14:17.940 --> 14:18.774
[gasps]

14:18.858 --> 14:20.401
[Lilith] Oh, fuck.

14:21.318 --> 14:23.445
I really wish
you hadn't returned my memory.

14:24.947 --> 14:27.741
[Jack screams]

14:34.748 --> 14:36.709
-Guys?
-[male voice] Jack!

14:37.668 --> 14:39.837
[clock ticking loud]

14:40.254 --> 14:41.213
Finally!

14:41.422 --> 14:42.339
Amir?

14:45.301 --> 14:46.719
What took you so long?

14:48.053 --> 14:50.514
-I've been waiting here for an eternity.
-But you're...

14:51.765 --> 14:53.225
-you're dead.
-I'm dead. [laughs]

14:53.851 --> 14:54.768
I know.

14:55.185 --> 14:57.521
I know everything, actually.
I know about The Order's magic,

14:57.605 --> 15:00.524
I know you're a werewolf,
I know your dad is a total choad.

15:00.608 --> 15:01.525
Okay, stop!

15:02.735 --> 15:04.945
What's happening here? Where are we?

15:06.989 --> 15:08.324
This is the afterlife.

15:14.246 --> 15:16.290
So, you're a ghost?

15:16.373 --> 15:18.375
Yeah. Or a spirit, I don't know.

15:18.709 --> 15:20.794
I'm a little shaky on the terms, but...

15:23.255 --> 15:24.632
Are you saying that I'm dead?

15:26.133 --> 15:27.676
I'm saying we should go get a drink.

15:31.388 --> 15:35.392
[faint ghostly voices]

15:39.730 --> 15:40.731
Clean this.

15:42.191 --> 15:43.817
[phone chiming]

16:10.219 --> 16:12.179
Miss Drake, I hope I'm not disturbing you.

16:13.055 --> 16:14.098
[locks phone screen]

16:14.390 --> 16:15.474
Of course not, Magus.

16:16.517 --> 16:18.978
You have been with him
since the beginning.

16:19.561 --> 16:21.772
He trusts you,
which means now I have to trust you,

16:21.855 --> 16:24.316
which is not ideal, but here we are.
Now, tell me.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.610
What is happening to the Grand Magus?

16:28.445 --> 16:29.655
He's bonding with the book.

16:30.739 --> 16:32.074
He says they're becoming one.

16:33.325 --> 16:35.536
-I think it's changing him.
-Of course it is.

16:36.537 --> 16:39.790
Starting prematurely was dangerous.
There's no way he's in control of it.

16:41.917 --> 16:44.420
He's just tired and worried.
This is his life's work.

16:44.503 --> 16:46.380
Don't do that.

16:46.922 --> 16:49.258
You are far too smart to act so stupid.

16:51.051 --> 16:54.888
He's the Grand Magus. That means we're
supposed to serve him, no matter what.

16:54.972 --> 16:56.557
We serve The Order.

16:57.641 --> 17:00.102
Not Edward Coventry or his ambition.

17:02.604 --> 17:05.315
Maybe you're enjoying your access
a little bit too much to see

17:05.399 --> 17:06.734
what's actually happening.

17:07.484 --> 17:10.154
The next incantation starts in 15 minutes.

17:10.612 --> 17:11.613
Be ready!

17:11.947 --> 17:13.407
[all] Yes, Magus.

17:20.080 --> 17:22.082
[insects chirping]

17:23.167 --> 17:25.169
[leaves rustling]

17:27.546 --> 17:28.756
[moans faintly]

17:30.215 --> 17:31.592
[Randall sighs]

17:33.010 --> 17:36.597
You've been mixing that stuff all night,
isn't it ready yet?

17:36.680 --> 17:39.058
[Lilith] Do you want it made fast,
or made right?

17:39.141 --> 17:40.601
Sure you know what you're doing?

17:40.684 --> 17:42.644
You're the one who found
my stupid memories,

17:42.728 --> 17:44.646
so shut up and let me use them!

17:44.855 --> 17:46.607
[Randall]
This potion will cure him, right?

17:46.690 --> 17:50.235
[Lilith] No, but it should buy us time
to figure out what is happening.

17:51.653 --> 17:53.405
Pour this into that...

17:54.448 --> 17:55.324
and shake it.

17:58.285 --> 18:01.538
I remember when you'd have broken my arm
for even suggesting we do magic.

18:01.622 --> 18:03.457
I'll break it if you don't shake faster.

18:03.540 --> 18:06.293
So, how could a spell book do this to him?

18:08.003 --> 18:09.296
I already told you.

18:09.588 --> 18:12.174
The Vade Maecum isn't just a spell book.

18:13.258 --> 18:15.511
It gives you absolute control over magic.

18:15.594 --> 18:19.264
No sacrifices, no potions, no spells.

18:20.265 --> 18:22.184
It's like you literally become magic.

18:22.893 --> 18:24.520
Then why doesn't everyone do it?

18:25.354 --> 18:27.940
One book, one person. That's the deal.

18:28.315 --> 18:29.358
We should be ready.

18:31.401 --> 18:32.361
Sit him up.

18:33.445 --> 18:35.447
[Randall] All right, Jack, up we go.

18:35.739 --> 18:37.407
-Up we go.
-[Jack groaning]

18:37.491 --> 18:39.952
Up we go. Here we go, buddy.

18:40.077 --> 18:42.079
[Jack groans]

18:42.246 --> 18:44.456
[Randall] Oh, shit. [sighs]

18:45.332 --> 18:47.084
-[Randall] There you go.
-Okay.

18:47.167 --> 18:49.837
[Hamish] Sippy time. Yeah.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.340
-[Randall] That's good? Yummy.
-[Hamish] Good stuff.

18:53.423 --> 18:56.093
[Lilith] Okay. And swallow.

18:58.053 --> 18:58.971
[Lilith sighs]

19:01.014 --> 19:03.642
[sighs]

19:04.518 --> 19:06.770
[seething]

19:08.063 --> 19:09.106
I think it's working.

19:12.526 --> 19:14.278
-[seething]
-[Jack yells]

19:15.696 --> 19:18.699
[Randall]
Guys, I hate to sound so pre-med,

19:18.782 --> 19:21.827
-but that looks like tissue rejection.
-Then what do we do?

19:22.578 --> 19:24.204
We have to remove Silverback.

19:24.997 --> 19:28.125
The only way to get a hide off a knight
is by death. That's the rule.

19:28.208 --> 19:30.544
And it's not like us to ever break a rule.

19:31.128 --> 19:32.337
[Lilith] It's not our call.

19:32.421 --> 19:35.299
Okay, fine, let's just ask him then.
Jack, buddy?

19:35.591 --> 19:37.092
You want us to save your life?

19:37.384 --> 19:38.969
[Jack groans]

19:39.094 --> 19:40.429
I'm taking that as a yes.

19:44.349 --> 19:46.602
-[phone keyboard clicking]
-Who are you calling?

19:48.353 --> 19:49.479
His grandfather.

19:49.563 --> 19:52.191
-[dialing tone]
-He deserves to know what's happening.

19:53.609 --> 19:55.569
[Amir's voice]
<i>Jack, your nose is bleeding.</i>

20:01.366 --> 20:02.409
[Jack] I'm not dead?

20:04.578 --> 20:07.789
My bet is you're dying.
Otherwise, you wouldn't be here.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.335
Oh, that's terrible.

20:13.378 --> 20:14.504
Tastes fine to me.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.674
So, how long have you been here?

20:19.343 --> 20:22.137
All I know is that one minute
I was being murdered by your roommate,

20:22.221 --> 20:24.306
and the next I was here.

20:25.182 --> 20:27.476
-Wait, you remember your own death?
-Yeah.

20:27.851 --> 20:30.938
I told you. We remember... everything.

20:31.021 --> 20:31.897
Who's we?

20:32.689 --> 20:33.607
[female voice] We.

20:34.733 --> 20:36.151
[Jack] Drea? Weston?

20:36.401 --> 20:37.361
You're here, too?

20:38.111 --> 20:40.364
I told you he asks
too many fucking questions.

20:40.989 --> 20:42.658
Ignore him. He's bitter.

20:42.741 --> 20:46.328
The afterlife is a college campus.
Of course I'm bitter.

20:46.536 --> 20:48.664
The afterlife
is wherever you want it to be.

20:48.747 --> 20:49.915
I don't want to be here.

20:50.791 --> 20:52.793
-I like it.
-Yeah, I bet you do.

20:53.126 --> 20:55.045
I was always really looking forward
to college.

20:56.171 --> 20:58.090
They say it's where you meet
your true friends.

20:58.674 --> 20:59.967
Or your best enemies.

21:00.968 --> 21:03.011
[male voice] Wait, what? [laughs]

21:03.136 --> 21:04.137
Alyssa?

21:04.221 --> 21:06.473
He's been tutoring you for how long
and you still haven't learned

21:06.556 --> 21:09.184
-a single incantation, huh?
-Kyle, what if someone hears you?

21:09.268 --> 21:12.896
Whatever. I'll just wipe their minds with
little obfuscation powder. Who cares?

21:12.980 --> 21:13.855
[Jack] Hey!

21:13.939 --> 21:15.691
-Get off her!
-Ignore it.

21:15.774 --> 21:17.401
They're not really here.

21:18.527 --> 21:19.903
[Drea] You get used to it.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.076
Used to what?

21:27.494 --> 21:30.414
That wasn't actually Kyle and Alyssa.

21:30.747 --> 21:31.832
It's just a memory.

21:31.915 --> 21:34.084
[Drea]
You were probably thinking about her.

21:34.960 --> 21:35.836
[Jack] I was...

21:36.753 --> 21:40.007
I was remembering what she said to me
the day I kicked Weston's ass.

21:40.090 --> 21:42.301
Oh, my God, I was hungover.
Do you wanna go again?

21:42.384 --> 21:43.635
Leave him alone.

21:44.136 --> 21:46.847
So, there you go.
You were thinking about her

21:47.306 --> 21:48.598
and she appeared.

21:48.849 --> 21:52.311
So, do you always think about
your girlfriends with other dudes, perv?

21:52.894 --> 21:55.981
I didn't know Alyssa when she was
dating Kyle. I wasn't even at Belgrave.

21:56.273 --> 21:57.107
Ah.

21:58.900 --> 22:00.068
That's not my memory.

22:01.445 --> 22:02.529
Where you going?

22:10.037 --> 22:12.039
-[fire crackling]
-[knocking on door]

22:13.040 --> 22:16.376
[door rattles, slams open]

22:16.626 --> 22:17.669
[Alyssa] Magus?

22:18.545 --> 22:19.379
[Edward] Come.

22:22.299 --> 22:23.925
We're ready for the next incantation.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.723
[door rattles shut]

22:31.099 --> 22:32.059
Your hand.

22:32.642 --> 22:33.977
[sighs]

22:34.269 --> 22:35.896
Have you seen anything yet?

22:36.563 --> 22:39.191
Any signs of the last section?

22:40.400 --> 22:41.443
No, Magus.

22:43.070 --> 22:46.531
But I have to admit,
I don't know what I'm looking for.

22:46.615 --> 22:48.492
[Edward] You'll know when you see it.

22:48.992 --> 22:51.328
Just expect the unexpected.

22:52.412 --> 22:54.331
Maybe if we slow down a little,

22:54.539 --> 22:56.541
give the book a chance to summon itself?

22:56.625 --> 22:58.168
[Edward] We're on a clock.

22:58.251 --> 23:01.546
The final incantation has to be performed
within three days.

23:02.714 --> 23:03.882
Should we stop?

23:03.965 --> 23:07.469
[Edward] The Vade Maecum Infernal
doesn't offer second chances.

23:08.011 --> 23:10.514
If I don't complete it, it will finish me.

23:12.307 --> 23:13.600
[Alyssa] The last part will come.

23:14.142 --> 23:16.645
It should already be here!

23:19.564 --> 23:21.525
Someone must be blocking it.

23:24.194 --> 23:25.112
Vera,

23:25.612 --> 23:27.280
twisting her little...

23:28.657 --> 23:30.325
knives against me.

23:32.619 --> 23:34.621
Asking too many questions.

23:35.872 --> 23:37.249
She's not loyal.

23:37.332 --> 23:40.001
I thought you didn't want
unquestioned loyalty.

23:48.510 --> 23:49.594
Within reason.

23:51.054 --> 23:52.639
I want you to take care of her.

23:54.683 --> 23:56.268
I'll talk with her, I promise.

23:56.351 --> 23:57.602
Did I say talk?

23:58.311 --> 23:59.521
Take her to my house.

24:00.021 --> 24:02.357
Tell her I want you both
to escort Maddox here.

24:02.441 --> 24:03.608
She knows he's a requirement.

24:04.651 --> 24:05.735
Requirement?

24:05.902 --> 24:07.195
[Edward] And when you return,

24:08.655 --> 24:10.907
I want that blade covered in her blood.

24:17.372 --> 24:18.832
[door rattles]

24:27.257 --> 24:28.133
Magus--

24:28.216 --> 24:29.593
[thump]

24:31.261 --> 24:32.554
You're wrong about her.

24:35.432 --> 24:37.851
You'll know soon enough, Magus.

24:38.435 --> 24:40.812
I see your hunger, Gabrielle Dupres.

24:43.857 --> 24:45.275
It's bigger than you are.

24:49.821 --> 24:52.449
[Randall]
Should we move him to the couch, or...

24:52.699 --> 24:53.909
[knocking on door]

24:53.992 --> 24:54.951
[male voice] Jack!

24:55.035 --> 24:56.536
-[knocking]
-Jack!

24:58.538 --> 24:59.456
Where is he?

24:59.539 --> 25:01.458
-Mr. Morton, I'm Hamish Duke.
<i>-</i>Jack!

25:04.002 --> 25:05.003
Jacky-boy.

25:05.545 --> 25:06.379
[Jack] Pops!

25:06.463 --> 25:08.381
It's Pops, buddy. I'm here.

25:10.592 --> 25:12.594
-What's wrong?
-[Hamish] I don't know what you know,

25:12.677 --> 25:15.347
-but you're gonna need to brace yourself.
-[Pops] He's a werewolf,

25:15.430 --> 25:17.474
and he's been fucked up by magic.

25:17.891 --> 25:19.601
He knows quite a bit.

25:22.437 --> 25:23.438
Tell me everything.

25:23.897 --> 25:26.358
Jack went to the temple to quit The Order.

25:26.441 --> 25:29.694
[Hamish] They were preparing for a spell.
Somehow it infected him.

25:29.778 --> 25:32.030
-When he came back, he was like this.
-[Pops] Oh, God.

25:32.113 --> 25:34.658
[Lilith] We think his hide
is trying to separate from him.

25:34.866 --> 25:36.826
-That's all we know.
-[Pops sobs]

25:39.663 --> 25:40.539
Okay.

25:41.206 --> 25:43.583
Okay. We gotta get him to a hospital.

25:45.085 --> 25:46.461
Doctors can't help him.

25:50.465 --> 25:51.508
[Pops sobs]

25:51.925 --> 25:53.552
[Pops] Oh, God, no!

25:55.929 --> 25:56.763
[Pops sobs]

25:56.846 --> 25:58.682
Look, Jack's Grandpa.

25:58.932 --> 26:01.768
Jack's body is under attack by his hide.

26:02.352 --> 26:06.064
He'll never heal as long as it keeps
pulling off and reattaching.

26:06.147 --> 26:08.525
-His hide? What?
-[Lilith] It's what makes us werewolves.

26:09.150 --> 26:11.111
We may be able to save him,

26:11.611 --> 26:13.655
if we can remove the hide.

26:14.656 --> 26:15.949
So-- So...

26:16.616 --> 26:20.745
if you pull it off, that's good, right?
I mean, he won't be a werewolf anymore?

26:24.499 --> 26:25.417
You don't know.

26:26.501 --> 26:28.753
We do know that doing nothing
is killing him.

26:36.303 --> 26:37.178
Do it.

26:42.392 --> 26:45.228
[Vera] I've seen the Grand Magus
doing superlative work today.

26:45.312 --> 26:47.272
[Alyssa] He's under a lot of pressure.

26:47.355 --> 26:50.275
[Vera]
Yes. Did he happen to mention to you

26:50.859 --> 26:53.361
why we're fetching his son so early?

26:54.362 --> 26:56.448
He wasn't in the mood for questions.

26:56.531 --> 26:58.825
Silence, subservience, and observance.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.202
You're certainly nailing two out of three.

27:01.453 --> 27:02.370
[horn honks]

27:03.121 --> 27:05.957
-He's always encouraged me to speak out--
-[Vera] That's worked a treat.

27:06.041 --> 27:08.835
Here you are,
going to get his son to be sacrificed.

27:10.337 --> 27:11.171
Oh, yes.

27:12.005 --> 27:12.922
Yes.

27:13.840 --> 27:17.719
Sacrificing Maddox is the price
that the Vade Maecum demands.

27:19.304 --> 27:20.138
His son?

27:21.431 --> 27:22.682
And his humanity.

27:23.308 --> 27:24.851
[horn honks]

27:27.062 --> 27:28.563
No, we're not that.

27:28.647 --> 27:29.689
[Vera] I know we're not.

27:30.231 --> 27:31.149
Do you?

27:31.691 --> 27:33.443
You're the one who gave him the book.

27:35.487 --> 27:38.281
The Vade Maecum's success rate is abysmal.

27:40.992 --> 27:42.285
You were hoping he'd fail.

27:43.995 --> 27:45.413
Odds were in my favor.

27:45.997 --> 27:46.873
[Alyssa sighs]

27:54.589 --> 27:55.507
Not anymore.

27:59.344 --> 28:00.345
[horn honks]

28:01.096 --> 28:02.722
[horn honks]

28:02.806 --> 28:04.933
I'll move when I'm ready!

28:17.529 --> 28:18.571
Okay.

28:20.073 --> 28:21.074
Now what?

28:22.909 --> 28:23.785
We wait.

28:25.495 --> 28:26.663
[sniffles]

28:27.247 --> 28:28.498
[Jack grunts]

28:29.624 --> 28:32.210
[seething, bubbling]

28:37.465 --> 28:39.008
Next time it breaks through.

28:48.768 --> 28:51.271
[squelching]

28:53.106 --> 28:55.191
[squelching]

28:55.275 --> 28:56.359
Now!

28:56.443 --> 29:00.155
[Jack screaming]

29:00.238 --> 29:03.283
[Jack roars]

29:03.366 --> 29:06.619
I take it back! This is more like a birth
than tissue rejection.

29:06.703 --> 29:08.663
[Lilith]
On what planet is this like a birth?

29:08.747 --> 29:10.623
-[Jack grunts]
-[squelching]

29:10.707 --> 29:12.417
Guys, there's something written
inside of it.

29:12.500 --> 29:14.627
[Jack yells]

29:14.711 --> 29:16.337
[seething]

29:16.421 --> 29:18.214
[Jack groans]

29:18.298 --> 29:19.799
[Randall] I got it. I got it. 

29:37.567 --> 29:38.401
Oh!

29:39.027 --> 29:39.861
No.

29:40.528 --> 29:41.362
No.

29:46.493 --> 29:47.410
No.

29:56.085 --> 29:57.212
You know magic.

29:58.463 --> 29:59.714
Bring him back.

30:03.635 --> 30:04.594
[shudders]

30:05.178 --> 30:06.054
We can't.

30:07.305 --> 30:08.306
I'm sorry.

30:09.974 --> 30:12.185
[voice wavering]
We can't resurrect the dead.

30:23.905 --> 30:25.198
First, my Chloe.

30:27.742 --> 30:28.701
And now, Jack.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.001
Mr. Morton, wait.

30:40.505 --> 30:41.631
[door thuds shut]

30:52.725 --> 30:54.519
I can't move it. What should I do?

30:55.478 --> 30:56.312
[Amir] Huh.

30:56.396 --> 30:59.440
This is 100% not what I expected
when you said Bone Room.

31:04.571 --> 31:06.406
Oh, Alyssa told me about this place.

31:06.489 --> 31:08.908
She was in the mind of a sleeping corpse.

31:10.034 --> 31:11.244
[Amir] That makes sense.

31:12.537 --> 31:14.831
This is where she got the second part
of the Vade Maecum.

31:14.914 --> 31:16.332
-[whoosh]
-[Alyssa gasps]

31:16.875 --> 31:18.877
-[slithering]
-[Alyssa gasps]

31:21.629 --> 31:23.006
[Alyssa gasps]

31:26.801 --> 31:28.052
This isn't my memory.

31:29.596 --> 31:30.555
It's Alyssa's.

31:32.348 --> 31:35.143
And if she's not dead, that means
we're inside of a living memory.

31:35.226 --> 31:40.064
Amir, this isn't the afterlife,
it's more like the collective unconscious.

31:40.315 --> 31:41.357
Oh, cool.

31:41.983 --> 31:45.278
-I'm a bit of a socialist myself, so--
-No. Dude, Carl Jung?

31:46.571 --> 31:48.656
Come on, man. This is Psych 101.

31:49.532 --> 31:51.367
I missed that class
on account of being dead.

31:51.451 --> 31:53.119
Oh, shit, you're right.

31:53.202 --> 31:54.871
Ah, okay, sorry.

31:55.663 --> 32:00.209
Collective unconscious is basically
all of human experience in one place.

32:00.668 --> 32:04.005
It's like this big pool of memory
that we can all drink from.

32:05.340 --> 32:07.050
You should never drink from a pool, right?

32:07.133 --> 32:07.967
What?

32:08.217 --> 32:10.511
No, I'm saying this is the pool.

32:11.054 --> 32:13.097
We're in it right now.
And every living person,

32:13.181 --> 32:16.017
all of their memories,
everything they know is here.

32:16.517 --> 32:18.645
[Amir] So, that explains
how I know you're a werewolf,

32:19.062 --> 32:21.022
and that your roommate killed me, and...

32:21.272 --> 32:24.651
[laughs]
your nickname in Boy Scouts was Pee Pants.

32:25.818 --> 32:27.070
That was one time, okay?

32:27.779 --> 32:31.074
It was because Tyler punched me
in the dink. I couldn't control it.

32:31.157 --> 32:32.367
It just-- it came out.

32:33.076 --> 32:33.910
Come on.

32:40.875 --> 32:41.709
Hey.

32:42.961 --> 32:44.337
You can't help him anymore.

32:45.922 --> 32:48.633
-[crickets chirping outside]
-[wind whistling]

32:49.550 --> 32:50.718
[Randall sniffles]

32:57.225 --> 32:59.602
[Hamish] I think this writing
is part of that Vade Maecum

32:59.686 --> 33:00.853
you were talking about.

33:00.937 --> 33:02.146
You found something?

33:02.563 --> 33:05.316
This is the journal of Grafton Davis,
also known as Alpha.

33:05.650 --> 33:07.443
[Lilith] Alpha? There was another Knight?

33:07.568 --> 33:11.072
Apparently. The journal only goes up
to the late '50s and then it just stops.

33:11.155 --> 33:13.908
That's around the last time
Silverback was in action.

33:13.992 --> 33:17.161
Does he explain why Jack's hide
was acting like the carpet in Aladdin?

33:17.245 --> 33:22.333
I think so. Grafton recruited a guy
by the name of Jurgen Sawyer.

33:22.417 --> 33:24.585
At first, Sawyer was a perfect Knight.

33:24.669 --> 33:28.047
Then he learned about
the Vade Maecum Infernal.

33:28.339 --> 33:29.340
And get this.

33:29.882 --> 33:33.052
It's our responsibility
to keep the thing in pieces.

33:33.136 --> 33:36.264
-[growling]
-We are doing a bang-up job.

33:37.056 --> 33:39.851
Sawyer became obsessed
with the Vade Maecum.

33:40.727 --> 33:43.980
Because he was a Knight,
he was able to track down all the pieces.

33:44.814 --> 33:47.859
Sawyer was the first person in centuries
to restore the book.

33:48.109 --> 33:49.193
Let me guess.

33:49.861 --> 33:51.362
Sawyer was Silverback.

33:51.446 --> 33:55.158
Grafton and the Knights tracked him down
and tore the Vade Maecum apart,

33:55.241 --> 33:59.412
just as he was about to complete the final
incantation and become one with the book.

33:59.495 --> 34:03.207
-If Sawyer was bound to the book...
-Then the book was bound to Silverback.

34:04.167 --> 34:06.294
That's why the page got stuck to the hide.

34:07.128 --> 34:11.966
Silverback wasn't hibernating
for the last fifty-odd years.

34:13.176 --> 34:14.635
He-- He was in a time-out.

34:15.720 --> 34:18.973
We were supposed to keep Silverback
from bonding with anyone,

34:19.057 --> 34:21.517
instead, I let him escape.

34:24.979 --> 34:26.981
Guys, I fucked up.

34:27.440 --> 34:28.316
We all did.

34:28.858 --> 34:32.111
[Hamish]
We had one job to do and we failed.

34:32.195 --> 34:34.322
[faint snarling]

34:34.781 --> 34:37.992
<i>"Et a quattuor angulis terrae</i>

34:38.534 --> 34:40.078
<i>atque quattuor</i>

34:40.787 --> 34:42.663
<i>plagis maris..."</i>

34:42.747 --> 34:46.876
Maybe we shouldn't recite the evil words
from the demon book?

34:46.959 --> 34:49.504
[Hamish] Whatever she's doing,
it's calming Silverback down.

34:49.587 --> 34:51.005
We should put him away.

34:52.048 --> 34:54.425
-[faint snarling]
-I'll take it downstairs.

34:55.635 --> 34:57.220
[faint growling]

34:59.472 --> 35:01.474
[growls]

35:01.974 --> 35:03.184
Hey.  Do you want help?

35:03.267 --> 35:05.520
Pretty sure I can lock a wolf hide
in a box.

35:14.529 --> 35:15.571
[door bangs]

35:19.283 --> 35:21.410
Oh, shit. How the hell did I get here?

35:22.245 --> 35:24.330
You furry bastard, you did this.

35:27.458 --> 35:29.460
[doors bang shut]

35:29.544 --> 35:31.379
[Edward] Lilith Bathory.

35:33.631 --> 35:35.007
Do you believe in destiny?

35:35.800 --> 35:38.636
You memory-stealing son of a bitch!

35:38.719 --> 35:40.471
[wood creaking]

35:42.265 --> 35:43.808
One of my new powers...

35:44.892 --> 35:46.769
is controlling your power.

35:48.062 --> 35:48.896
And I...

35:50.189 --> 35:53.234
[laughing]
I just rooted your feet to the floor.

35:53.818 --> 35:55.778
You know, I always regretted
expelling you.

35:56.487 --> 35:57.363
[Lilith grunts]

35:57.446 --> 35:59.657
You had so much potential.

36:01.075 --> 36:02.535
But now I wonder...

36:03.536 --> 36:05.079
if it was meant to happen?

36:08.040 --> 36:10.251
Because it's given us
this moment together.

36:10.334 --> 36:13.004
Let me go, and I'll give you a moment
you'll never forget.

36:13.129 --> 36:15.256
Thanks, but I'm gonna save you...

36:16.215 --> 36:17.216
and your friends.

36:18.426 --> 36:21.012
I'll need someone to practice my power on.

36:22.096 --> 36:25.349
Just as soon as I complete this book.

36:32.481 --> 36:33.858
[flesh twisting]

36:33.941 --> 36:36.110
[seething]

36:42.575 --> 36:43.701
[thump]

36:46.370 --> 36:49.457
[Hamish]
Well, you were right about one thing.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.126
What's that?

36:52.585 --> 36:54.462
He was a perfect choice for a Knight.

36:55.379 --> 36:56.214
Yeah.

36:57.715 --> 36:58.841
He was okay.

36:59.050 --> 36:59.926
[laughs]

37:00.718 --> 37:01.636
Lilith!

37:02.261 --> 37:03.304
What do we do now?

37:04.055 --> 37:05.556
According to one of the journals,

37:05.640 --> 37:08.309
we should eat him
and absorb his warrior spirit.

37:10.061 --> 37:11.270
Or we could bury him.

37:11.354 --> 37:12.313
Sounds good to me.

37:13.231 --> 37:14.106
Lilith!

37:22.323 --> 37:23.157
Lilith!

37:28.955 --> 37:29.956
It's empty.

37:34.085 --> 37:34.919
[Edward] Yes!

37:41.008 --> 37:42.260
Why are you doing this?

37:42.843 --> 37:44.345
You know what that book is.

37:44.887 --> 37:47.139
It's the opportunity of a lifetime.

37:47.348 --> 37:50.810
You're trading your humanity for what?
Unlimited magic?

37:50.893 --> 37:51.852
[Edward] I know.

37:52.353 --> 37:53.604
It's a hell of a bargain.

37:53.896 --> 37:55.273
It's a deal with the devil.

37:55.356 --> 37:57.900
[Edward] Oh, stop being so melodramatic.

37:58.651 --> 38:01.237
Magic isn't good or evil, it just is.

38:01.654 --> 38:02.571
Yeah.

38:02.655 --> 38:04.824
-[creaking]
-[Lilith gasps]

38:06.701 --> 38:08.494
The world needs a reboot.

38:09.537 --> 38:11.664
Who better to push that button than me?

38:12.957 --> 38:16.294
You monumental narcissistic asshole!

38:16.377 --> 38:17.712
[electrical crackling]

38:21.757 --> 38:23.217
[Amir] This is the temple?

38:25.761 --> 38:27.388
This is really cool.

38:27.888 --> 38:30.391
Sorry you died
before you got the chance to see it.

38:31.559 --> 38:32.893
I mean, you did try to warn me.

38:33.436 --> 38:35.646
I just had to have a celebratory beer.

38:36.105 --> 38:39.233
Ha, I'm a Degrassi episode
on the dangers of underage drinking.

38:40.067 --> 38:41.277
He completed the book.

38:42.737 --> 38:44.322
I've been working my whole life

38:44.905 --> 38:46.157
to try and bring him down

38:46.240 --> 38:48.492
and the son of a bitch still comes out
on top.

38:49.577 --> 38:51.287
Yeah, it sucks.

38:51.620 --> 38:53.581
I mean, I was murdered, but...

39:04.175 --> 39:05.259
I know how to stop him.

39:06.927 --> 39:07.887
I gotta get out of here.

39:08.471 --> 39:10.139
You... you can't.

39:10.222 --> 39:13.351
-You're dying. You might already be dead.
-Amir, I have to save my friends

39:13.434 --> 39:15.019
and maybe a whole bunch of other people!

39:15.102 --> 39:17.229
Don't you get it?
If you wanted to be out of here...

39:18.230 --> 39:19.315
you'd be out of here.

39:19.815 --> 39:21.192
You're saying I want this?

39:21.859 --> 39:24.487
Well, you did tell Pete
you'd never made a decision before.

39:24.570 --> 39:27.073
One, stay out of my memories, and...

39:27.656 --> 39:29.784
two, I don't wanna die.

39:32.787 --> 39:33.829
I don't want to die.

39:36.123 --> 39:37.333
I don't want to die!

39:38.751 --> 39:39.752
Oh!

39:39.835 --> 39:41.545
Fuck, that hurts!

39:41.629 --> 39:44.090
[gasping]

39:44.507 --> 39:46.717
[panting]

39:48.052 --> 39:49.720
Hello!

39:50.513 --> 39:51.514
[sighs]

39:51.597 --> 39:52.640
[door bangs]

39:52.723 --> 39:54.725
-Jack! Jack, you're alive!
-[Jack screams]

39:54.809 --> 39:55.643
I'm sorry.

39:56.143 --> 39:59.021
I'm just-- I'm just so happy
you're alive. Oh, shit.

39:59.105 --> 40:00.606
[Jack groans]

40:00.689 --> 40:03.025
Jack, you were just dead,
you should probably rest.

40:03.109 --> 40:04.276
No, we're out of time.

40:04.527 --> 40:08.406
I saw Lilith, she was in my dream
or the afterlife.

40:08.989 --> 40:11.242
-I don't know which one.
-Dude, you're not making any sense.

40:11.325 --> 40:13.828
Lilith is gone. And she took Silverback.

40:14.120 --> 40:16.455
She's at the Temple. Coventry has her.

40:17.748 --> 40:20.042
-Are you sure?
-Yeah. I was in his memory.

40:21.001 --> 40:22.336
We need to get into that temple.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.255
Jack's not going anywhere
in his condition.

40:24.338 --> 40:27.299
[Jack] I'm fine. [groans]

40:27.383 --> 40:29.552
-Just give me a minute.
-Yeah.

40:29.635 --> 40:32.972
Without Silverback, you're going
to have to heal at human speed.

40:33.222 --> 40:34.390
No, we don't have time.

40:35.975 --> 40:37.309
Maybe there's another way.

40:38.644 --> 40:39.854
[Jack] Gentle.

40:39.937 --> 40:42.064
[groans]

40:43.899 --> 40:45.317
Hey, Cannon Fodder...

40:46.986 --> 40:49.530
what do you say you and I go fight
some evil magic?

40:51.240 --> 40:52.199
[Jack sighs]

40:54.535 --> 40:55.536
Nope?

40:57.455 --> 40:58.330
Duh...

40:58.414 --> 41:00.749
It should be jumping in to me by now,
shouldn't it?

41:02.585 --> 41:03.502
[sighs]

41:05.254 --> 41:08.549
Okay, you told me Cannon Fodder
picks anyone who gets close to it.

41:09.258 --> 41:10.134
Yeah.

41:10.968 --> 41:12.261
It usually does.

41:12.595 --> 41:13.721
It sure worked with Kyle.

41:13.804 --> 41:16.432
Maybe it's because I'm still bonded
with Silverback?

41:16.599 --> 41:19.602
[Hamish] The journals never called him
Cannon Fodder. He's Midnight.

41:20.519 --> 41:22.521
Grafton Davis called him
the noblest of the Knights.

41:23.022 --> 41:24.857
-Who?
-He's another Knight.

41:25.232 --> 41:26.942
[Hamish] And according to Grafton,

41:27.026 --> 41:29.612
Midnight would always be the one
who would...

41:32.323 --> 41:33.407
Who would what?

41:34.825 --> 41:35.993
Sacrifice himself.

41:38.746 --> 41:40.039
[sighs] Okay.

41:40.789 --> 41:41.707
Midnight,

41:42.791 --> 41:43.792
please.

41:45.002 --> 41:46.295
We've got work to do.

41:47.213 --> 41:49.006
I know the risk. I accept it.

41:51.467 --> 41:54.261
[tingling]

41:56.347 --> 41:57.765
[Randall sighs]

42:07.525 --> 42:09.068
[Alyssa gasps]

42:09.151 --> 42:11.362
You and your fucking Daddy issues.

42:13.405 --> 42:15.074
What are you doing here?

42:15.157 --> 42:17.618
-Edward has the book.
-The Vade Maecum, I know.

42:17.701 --> 42:18.869
[Lilith] Let me finish.

42:19.370 --> 42:21.163
He has the whole book.

42:24.166 --> 42:25.960
We have to get you out of here.

42:26.043 --> 42:28.796
He used an Acedia incantation on me.

42:29.505 --> 42:30.965
I can't reverse it.

42:31.549 --> 42:32.591
[Alyssa] I can.

42:42.434 --> 42:44.478
[Alyssa whispering] Come on.

42:44.562 --> 42:46.814
<i>Ipsa liberetur.</i>

42:47.231 --> 42:49.233
[dull roaring sound]

42:49.316 --> 42:50.568
[Lilith sighs]

42:50.651 --> 42:52.319
Okay.<i> </i>Do you know where the book is?

42:52.403 --> 42:54.822
He's been carrying it around
like it's his baby.

42:57.575 --> 42:58.742
Are you out of your mind?

42:58.826 --> 43:00.953
You're not leaving
without the Vade Maecum.

43:01.120 --> 43:03.914
Now, when Edward arrives,
wait for my signal.

43:04.540 --> 43:06.166
Make a break for it. I'll grab the book.

43:06.250 --> 43:07.418
This is a terrible plan.

43:07.501 --> 43:09.253
-Do you have a better idea?
-Several.

43:09.336 --> 43:11.255
-[doors clang open]
-[Alyssa] Shh.

43:11.338 --> 43:12.381
Alyssa.

43:15.467 --> 43:17.094
I was starting to worry.

43:18.220 --> 43:20.723
It's harder to hide a body than I thought.

43:20.806 --> 43:21.640
I know.

43:22.683 --> 43:23.976
Is there blood on the blade?

43:30.941 --> 43:32.026
Like you asked.

43:33.944 --> 43:34.945
Excellent.

43:46.081 --> 43:48.417
Did Vera struggle?

43:49.627 --> 43:50.502
She did.

43:51.545 --> 43:52.379
Did you?

43:53.714 --> 43:55.341
Why do you think it took so long?

43:59.595 --> 44:01.013
[clothes ripping]

44:01.096 --> 44:02.181
[snarls]

44:02.473 --> 44:04.099
[fierce snarls]

44:04.183 --> 44:06.727
-[knife clangs]
-[wolf snarls]

44:07.686 --> 44:08.771
Thanks for the shirt.

44:08.854 --> 44:11.106
-[Randall] I wear it better.
-[Hamish] We need to talk about a plan.

44:11.190 --> 44:12.983
[Jack] Go to the temple,
get Alyssa and Lilith,

44:13.067 --> 44:14.610
stop the ceremony, and destroy the book.

44:14.693 --> 44:17.279
-That's not a plan. It's an end goal.
-I love it.

44:17.446 --> 44:19.114
We're not going in there guns blazing.

44:19.198 --> 44:22.201
-Coventry will take us all down.
-Then we go in guns not-blazing.

44:22.284 --> 44:23.243
But we go in.

44:23.494 --> 44:25.704
Long is the road and short is the life.

44:27.206 --> 44:29.541
-Okay. Let's do it.
-Shit. Pete.

44:30.250 --> 44:32.628
-[Hamish] Are you kidding me?
-What? He thinks I'm dead.

44:33.212 --> 44:34.713
I need to let him know I'm all right.

44:34.797 --> 44:36.006
[phone chimes]

44:37.549 --> 44:38.509
Oh, shit.

44:40.302 --> 44:41.970
-[door slams]
-Where are you going, Jack?

44:42.388 --> 44:44.848
[Jack panting]

44:44.932 --> 44:45.766
[Randall] Jack!

44:46.183 --> 44:47.017
Jack!

44:47.434 --> 44:48.894
So much for plan A.

44:52.022 --> 44:53.982
[Alyssa panting]

44:54.066 --> 44:56.068
-[Alyssa groans]
-[Jack] Alyssa!

44:57.236 --> 44:58.070
[Jack] Hurry!

44:58.987 --> 44:59.822
Leave it!

45:00.906 --> 45:03.701
[Alyssa gasping]

45:20.968 --> 45:22.094
[gun cocks]

45:24.722 --> 45:25.556
Pops.

45:26.849 --> 45:29.977
[rebound, descending-pitch whine]

45:31.937 --> 45:32.980
[thud]

45:37.818 --> 45:38.652
Jack?

45:38.736 --> 45:40.529
[Edward roars]

45:40.612 --> 45:41.572
[splat]

45:41.655 --> 45:43.073
No!

45:50.080 --> 45:52.833
-[Alyssa] Don't. It's too late.
-[Edward] I offered you a front row seat

45:52.916 --> 45:54.668
to the greatest moment in history

45:55.377 --> 45:56.545
and you betrayed me.

45:56.628 --> 45:58.964
He's too strong. He's too strong.

45:59.256 --> 46:00.424
[Edward] It doesn't matter.

46:00.507 --> 46:01.550
Neither do you.

46:02.968 --> 46:04.136
Or your friends.

46:04.678 --> 46:06.180
[thump]
