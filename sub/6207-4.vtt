00:02.169 --> 00:03.212
Something turned him into a monster.

00:03.421 --> 00:06.173
What are we dealing with?
Croatoan. A demonic virus.

00:06.257 --> 00:07.633
Demonic germ warfare.

00:07.717 --> 00:10.136
PAMELA: What if we all have it?
What if we all go crazy?

00:11.303 --> 00:16.517
JOHN: Back in 1835, Samuel Colt made
a gun. They say this gun can kill anything.

00:16.892 --> 00:18.144
-I'm a vessel?
-The vessel.

00:18.352 --> 00:21.230
You need my consent. Michael needs
my say-so to ride in my skin.

00:21.439 --> 00:24.066
-Unfortunately, yes.
-The answer's no.

00:24.150 --> 00:26.318
-You know who I am.
-Lucifer.

00:26.402 --> 00:28.988
You're the one, Sam.
You're my vessel.

00:29.196 --> 00:30.322
That will never happen.

00:30.531 --> 00:31.949
I know you don't trust me.

00:32.158 --> 00:33.951
-What are you saying?
-I'm dangerous.

00:34.160 --> 00:36.412
Maybe it's best
we just go our separate ways.

00:41.417 --> 00:44.170
Hi, good evening, brother.
Is your soul rapture-ready?

00:44.253 --> 00:46.672
Thank you, brother. God bless.

00:46.756 --> 00:48.883
Good evening.
Is your soul rapture-ready?

00:49.091 --> 00:53.846
What I'd like to do is show you what
God's love is for you. Okay. God bless.

00:54.054 --> 00:58.434
Excuse me. But have you taken time out
to think about God's plan for you?

01:00.436 --> 01:02.438
Too frigging much, pal.

01:06.609 --> 01:09.361
We're talking about the Colt, right?

01:09.570 --> 01:12.364
-I mean, as in "the" Colt?
CASTIEL: We are.

01:12.573 --> 01:15.826
That doesn't make any sense.
Why would the demons keep a gun...

01:16.035 --> 01:17.077
...that kills demons?

01:17.286 --> 01:21.290
What? What? Dean-- I didn't--

01:21.499 --> 01:22.625
I didn't get that.

01:22.833 --> 01:23.918
(DEAN CHUCKLES)

01:24.126 --> 01:26.629
That's funny, talking
to a messenger of God on a cell phone.

01:26.837 --> 01:29.590
It's, you know, like watching
a Hells Angel ride a moped.

01:29.799 --> 01:32.676
This isn't funny. The voice says
I'm almost out of minutes.

01:32.885 --> 01:35.095
Okay. All right. I'm telling you, Cass...

01:35.346 --> 01:37.515
...the mooks have
melted down the gun by now.

01:37.723 --> 01:39.308
Well, I hear differently.

01:39.391 --> 01:45.022
And if it's true, and if you are still set
on the insane task of killing the devil...

01:45.105 --> 01:47.149
-...this is how we do it.
-Okay. Where do we start?

01:48.025 --> 01:51.195
-Where are you now?
-Kansas City.

01:53.113 --> 01:56.200
-Century Hotel, room 113.
-I'll be there immediately.

01:56.408 --> 01:58.327
Whoa, whoa, whoa, no.
Come on, man.

01:58.410 --> 02:01.247
I just drove like 16 hours straight.
Okay?

02:01.372 --> 02:03.624
I'm human
and there's stuff I gotta do.

02:03.833 --> 02:06.752
-What stuff?
-Eat, for example. In this case, sleep.

02:07.002 --> 02:09.964
-I just need four hours once in a while.
-Yes.

02:10.172 --> 02:12.341
Okay.
So you can pop in tomorrow morning.

02:12.424 --> 02:14.176
Yes.

02:14.260 --> 02:15.386
I'll just...

02:19.640 --> 02:21.267
...wait here then.

02:24.520 --> 02:27.857
(BUZZING)

02:33.153 --> 02:36.156
Damn it, Cass, I need to sleep.

02:36.365 --> 02:38.284
SAM:
Dean, it's me.

02:38.868 --> 02:40.536
Sam?

02:41.912 --> 02:43.455
It's quarter past 4.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.541
This is important.

02:47.418 --> 02:50.045
So you're his vessel, huh?

02:51.422 --> 02:54.133
Lucifer's wearing you to the prom.

02:54.341 --> 02:55.384
That's what he said.

02:55.467 --> 02:58.679
Just when you thought you were out,
they pull you back in, huh?

02:58.762 --> 03:00.806
So that's it? That's your response?

03:01.181 --> 03:04.476
-What are you looking for?
-I don't know, a little panic, maybe.

03:04.685 --> 03:07.980
I'm a little numb to earth-shattering
revelations at this point.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.940
What are we gonna do about it?

03:10.149 --> 03:12.192
What do you wanna do about it?

03:12.818 --> 03:14.403
I want back in, for starters.

03:14.695 --> 03:15.738
-Sam--
-I mean it.

03:15.946 --> 03:18.324
I'm sick of being a puppet
to these sons of bitches.

03:19.366 --> 03:22.369
-I'm gonna hunt him down.
-We're back to revenge, are we?

03:22.453 --> 03:26.332
-Because that worked out well last time.
-Not revenge.

03:26.749 --> 03:28.000
Redemption.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.920
You're gonna walk back in
and we'll be the dynamic duo again?

03:31.128 --> 03:33.380
Look, Dean, I can do this. I can.

03:33.464 --> 03:35.299
I'm gonna prove it to you.

03:39.178 --> 03:42.640
Look, Sam, it doesn't matter.

03:43.098 --> 03:45.142
Whatever we do.

03:46.352 --> 03:49.229
I mean, it turns out that you and me,
we're the--

03:49.438 --> 03:51.231
The fire and the oil
of the Armageddon.

03:51.440 --> 03:55.235
You know, on that basis alone,
we should just pick a hemisphere.

03:56.362 --> 03:57.655
Stay away from each other.

03:57.863 --> 04:00.282
It doesn't have to be like this.
We can fight it.

04:00.366 --> 04:03.994
Yeah, you're right, we can.
But not together.

04:04.787 --> 04:09.291
We're not stronger
when we're together, Sam.

04:09.375 --> 04:11.543
I think we're weaker...

04:12.169 --> 04:15.047
...because whatever we have
between us...

04:15.255 --> 04:19.009
...love, family, whatever it is,
they are always...

04:19.218 --> 04:21.011
...gonna use it against us...

04:21.261 --> 04:23.263
...and you know that.

04:28.435 --> 04:30.813
Yeah, we're better off apart.

04:31.438 --> 04:34.066
We got a better chance
of dodging Lucifer and Michael...

04:34.274 --> 04:36.360
...and this whole damn thing...

04:37.861 --> 04:39.780
...if we just go our own ways.

04:40.447 --> 04:41.657
Dean, don't do this.

04:44.576 --> 04:46.453
Bye, Sam.

06:39.358 --> 06:41.110
Little girl?

06:44.571 --> 06:46.323
Little girl?

06:48.575 --> 06:50.202
Are you hurt?

06:53.372 --> 06:56.458
You know the not-talking thing
is kind of creepy, right?

07:12.808 --> 07:14.643
Oh, crap.

07:55.058 --> 07:56.476
(OVER SPEAKERS)

-Well, do you love me?

-I'm in the groove
-Now do you love me?

08:03.483 --> 08:05.485
Do you love me?

08:05.694 --> 08:13.493
Now that I can dance?

Right. No more sports.

Congress revoked the right
to group assembly.

09:23.814 --> 09:26.942
What's left of Congress, that is.
Hardly a quorum if you ask me.

09:27.025 --> 09:30.779
-How did you find me?
-Had to tap some unorthodox resources.

09:30.988 --> 09:32.030

We've been making inspirational visits
to the fringier Christian groups.

told to keep an eye out.

-Onward, Christian soldiers.
-Good.

Now send me back, you son of a bitch.

-Marinate?
-Three days, Dean.

Three days to see
where this action takes you.

09:58.932 --> 10:03.937
-What's that supposed to mean?
-That your choices have consequences.

In fact, why don't you give me
one good reason...

12:37.632 --> 12:40.552
...why I shouldn't gank you
right here and now?

...is that you had every hidden lock pick,
box cutter and switchblade that I carry.

They were pink and satiny
and you know what?

14:12.811 --> 14:13.895

Touché.

14:24.823 --> 14:27.492
So, what, Zach zapped you up here
to see how bad it gets?

14:27.701 --> 14:28.952
I guess.

14:30.412 --> 14:33.123
Croatoan virus, right?
That's their endgame?

14:33.331 --> 14:37.294
It's efficient, it's incurable
and it's scary as hell.

14:37.711 --> 14:39.588
Turns people into monsters.

14:39.796 --> 14:42.924
Started hitting the major cities
about two years ago.

Sam didn't make it.

-You weren't with him?
-No.

15:10.869 --> 15:13.747
No. Me and Sam, we haven't talked...

15:14.581 --> 15:16.791
...in, hell, five years.

15:20.086 --> 15:22.088
We never tried to find him?

15:23.840 --> 15:25.967
We had other people to worry about.

15:26.176 --> 15:29.179
-Where you going?
-I gotta run an errand.

15:30.347 --> 15:31.848
-You're gonna leave me here?
-Yes.

15:32.390 --> 15:36.353
Got a camp full of trauma survivors with
an apocalypse hanging over their head.

is a version of The Parent Trap.

have to cuff me, man.

Hi. Listen, we're pretty good
on canned goods for now...

16:34.661 --> 16:38.123
...but we're down to next to nothing
on perishables and hygiene supplies.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.834
People are not gonna be happy
about this.

16:41.042 --> 16:43.336
So, what do you think we should do?

16:44.963 --> 16:45.922
I don't know.

16:47.549 --> 16:51.219
Maybe share?
You know, like in a kibbutz.

16:53.096 --> 16:55.932
Wait, aren't you supposed to be
out on a mission right now?

16:56.182 --> 16:58.309
-Absolutely, and I will be.
-Uh-oh.

didn't you?

17:05.692 --> 17:07.902
What? I-- Did I?

17:08.570 --> 17:10.864
I thought we had a "connection."

17:11.072 --> 17:13.116
-Well, I'm sure that we do.
-Yeah?

17:13.533 --> 17:15.368
-Hi, Risa.
RISA: Screw you.

17:17.078 --> 17:19.497
I'm getting busted for stuff
I haven't done yet.

17:19.706 --> 17:20.749
What?

17:21.499 --> 17:22.959
Never mind.

17:23.209 --> 17:27.005
Hey, Chuck, is Cass still here?

17:27.088 --> 17:30.842
Yeah. I don't think
Cass is going anywhere.

17:42.103 --> 17:48.151
CASTIEL: In this way, we are each
a fragment of total perception.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.153
Just...

17:50.236 --> 17:56.451
...one compartment in that
dragonfly eye of group mind.

17:57.160 --> 17:58.203
Now...

17:58.411 --> 18:03.333
...the key to this total
shared perception is--

18:03.917 --> 18:06.169
It's surprisingly physical.

18:08.254 --> 18:11.925
Excuse me. I think I need to confer
with our fearless leader for a minute.

18:12.383 --> 18:14.260
Why not go get washed up
for the orgy?

18:18.515 --> 18:20.266
You're all so beautiful.

18:29.025 --> 18:30.568
What are you, a hippie?

18:30.777 --> 18:34.030
I thought you'd gotten over trying
to label me.

18:35.907 --> 18:38.034
-Cass, we gotta talk.
-Whoa, strange.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.160
What?

18:39.285 --> 18:42.580
You are not you.
Not now you anyway.

18:42.956 --> 18:45.041
No. Yeah. Yes. Exactly.

18:45.750 --> 18:47.669
-What year are you from?
-2009.

18:49.212 --> 18:52.090
-Who did this to you? Is it Zachariah?
-Yes.

18:53.842 --> 18:56.469
-Interesting.
-Oh, yeah. It's frigging fascinating.

18:56.678 --> 18:58.680
Why don't you strap
on your angel wings...

18:58.930 --> 19:02.433
...and fly me back to my page
on the calendar?

19:04.227 --> 19:11.025
I wish I could just strap on my wings,
but I'm sorry, no dice.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.612
What are you, stoned?

19:14.821 --> 19:16.823
Generally, yeah.

19:19.367 --> 19:20.702
What happened to you?

19:22.120 --> 19:23.830
Life.

19:50.732 --> 19:52.275
Hey, hey. Watch out!

20:04.037 --> 20:05.663
Damn it.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.250
I'm not gonna lie to you. Me and him...

20:09.459 --> 20:12.170
...it's a pretty messed-up situation
we got going.

20:12.253 --> 20:13.338
But believe me...

20:14.756 --> 20:17.133
...when you need to know something,
you will know it.

20:18.176 --> 20:20.887
Until then, we all have work to do.

20:25.683 --> 20:28.519
-What the hell was that?
-What the hell was that?

20:28.728 --> 20:30.313
You just shot a guy in cold blood.

20:31.022 --> 20:33.316
We were in an open quarantine zone...

20:33.524 --> 20:36.069
...got ambushed by some Crotes
on the way out.

20:36.277 --> 20:39.155
Crotes. Croatoans.
One of them infected Yeager.

20:40.198 --> 20:41.449
How do you know?

20:41.658 --> 20:43.868
Because after a few years of this,
I know.

20:44.077 --> 20:46.245
I started seeing symptoms
about a half-hour ago.

20:46.454 --> 20:49.040
Wasn't gonna be long
before he flipped.

20:49.457 --> 20:51.960
I didn't see the point in troubling
a good man with bad news.

20:52.168 --> 20:55.129
"Troubling a good man?" You blew
him away in front of your people.

20:55.338 --> 20:57.924
-Don't you think that freaked them out?
-It's 2014.

20:58.341 --> 21:01.970
Plugging some Crote,
it's called commonplace.

21:02.178 --> 21:06.015
Trading words with my frigging clone,
that might've freaked them out a little.

21:06.224 --> 21:08.351
-All right, look--
-No, you look.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.311
This isn't your time. It's mine.

21:10.728 --> 21:15.483
You don't make the decisions, I do.
So when I say stay in, you stay in.

21:22.365 --> 21:27.912
All right, man. I'm sorry.
Look, I'm not trying to mess you-- Me--

21:28.121 --> 21:30.331
-Us up here.
-I know.

21:33.626 --> 21:36.170
This has been
a really wacky weekend.

21:36.379 --> 21:38.214
Tell me about it.

21:46.848 --> 21:49.392
What was the mission anyway?

21:59.027 --> 22:00.611
The Colt?

22:02.613 --> 22:04.407
The Colt.

22:06.200 --> 22:07.660
Where was it?

22:07.869 --> 22:09.287
Everywhere.

22:09.495 --> 22:11.247
They've been moving it around.

22:12.206 --> 22:13.750
It took me five years...

22:15.752 --> 22:17.837
...but I finally got it.

22:18.629 --> 22:19.797
Tonight....

22:21.507 --> 22:24.135
Tonight, I'm gonna kill the devil.

22:33.561 --> 22:36.814
So that's it? That's the Colt.

22:38.149 --> 22:40.985
If anything can kill Lucifer, this is it.

22:41.194 --> 22:45.490
Great. Have we got anything
that can find Lucifer?

22:45.865 --> 22:49.243
-Are you okay?
-We were in Jane's cabin last night...

22:50.203 --> 22:56.000
...and apparently,
we and Risa have a connection.

22:59.462 --> 23:01.214
You wanna shut up?

23:01.297 --> 23:04.425
We don't have to find Lucifer.
We know where he is.

23:04.550 --> 23:07.261
The demon
that we caught last week...

23:07.345 --> 23:10.181
...he was one of
the big guy's entourage. He knew.

23:10.264 --> 23:13.726
So a demon tells you where Satan's
gonna be and you just believe it?

23:13.935 --> 23:16.229
No, trust me, he wasn't lying.

23:16.312 --> 23:17.480
RISA:
And you know this how?

23:17.563 --> 23:20.608
Our fearless leader, I'm afraid,
is all too well-schooled...

23:20.817 --> 23:23.444
...in the art of getting to the truth.

23:24.862 --> 23:26.572
Torture?

23:28.699 --> 23:32.203
Oh, so we're torturing again.

23:32.954 --> 23:34.831
That's good.

23:35.039 --> 23:36.290
Classy.

23:39.252 --> 23:42.296
What? I like past you.

23:43.506 --> 23:45.424
Lucifer is here. Now.

23:45.633 --> 23:48.344
I know the block, I know the building.

23:48.928 --> 23:51.139
Good.
It's right in the middle of a hot zone.

23:51.347 --> 23:53.850
Crawling with Crotes.
You saying my plan is reckless?

23:54.058 --> 23:56.269
Are you saying we walk in,
up the driveway...

23:56.352 --> 23:58.688
...past the demons and Crotes,
and shoot the devil?

23:58.771 --> 23:59.897
-Yes.
-Okay.

24:00.106 --> 24:03.693
If you don't like "reckless"
I could use "insouciant," maybe.

24:03.901 --> 24:05.653
Are you coming?

24:06.445 --> 24:09.866
Of course. But why is he?
I mean, he's you five years ago.

24:10.074 --> 24:11.993
If something happens to him,
you're gone.

24:12.243 --> 24:14.328
-He's coming.
-Okay.

24:15.329 --> 24:17.373
We'll get the grunts moving.

24:17.623 --> 24:19.542
We're loaded and on the road
by midnight.

24:19.750 --> 24:21.377
CASTIEL:
Alrighty.

24:24.505 --> 24:28.301
-Why are you taking me?
-Relax, you'll be fine.

24:29.093 --> 24:31.429
Zach's looking after you, right?

24:32.972 --> 24:34.390
No, that's not what I mean.

24:36.100 --> 24:37.977
I wanna know what's going on.

24:42.023 --> 24:43.816
Yeah, okay.

24:48.446 --> 24:51.449
You're coming
because I want you to see something.

24:52.408 --> 24:54.452
I want you to see our brother.

24:55.661 --> 24:57.455
Sam?

24:58.456 --> 24:59.540
I thought he was dead.

25:02.501 --> 25:05.463
Sam didn't die in Detroit.

25:06.005 --> 25:07.340
He said yes.

25:08.424 --> 25:09.467
"Yes"?

25:14.680 --> 25:16.015
Wait.

25:18.392 --> 25:19.727
-You mean--?
-That's right.

25:19.936 --> 25:22.438
The big yes...

25:22.521 --> 25:24.357
...to the devil.

25:24.440 --> 25:27.151
Lucifer's wearing him to the prom.

25:32.406 --> 25:35.451
-Why would he do that?
-Wish I knew.

25:36.410 --> 25:38.371
But now we don't have a choice.

25:39.622 --> 25:41.874
It's in him and it's not getting out...

25:43.542 --> 25:45.378
...and we've gotta kill him, Dean.

25:49.215 --> 25:51.467
And you need to see it...

25:51.968 --> 25:55.388
...the whole damn thing, how bad
it gets, so you can do it different.

25:55.471 --> 25:58.224
-What do you mean?
-Zach was gonna bring you back.

25:58.349 --> 26:00.226
-Right? To '09?
-Yeah.

26:00.434 --> 26:02.270
When you get back home...

26:03.396 --> 26:05.439
...you say yes.

26:06.107 --> 26:08.484
You hear me? Say yes to Michael.

26:08.901 --> 26:10.278
That's crazy.

26:10.486 --> 26:12.613
If I let him in,
then Michael fights the devil.

26:12.822 --> 26:16.409
-Battle's gonna torch half the planet.
-Look around you, man.

26:16.742 --> 26:20.496
Half the planet's better than no planet,
which is what we have now.

26:20.913 --> 26:23.416
If I could do it over,
I'd say yes in a heartbeat.

26:23.499 --> 26:25.501
-So why don't you?
-I've tried.

26:25.584 --> 26:28.004
I've shouted yes
till I was blue in the face.

26:28.212 --> 26:31.424
The angels aren't listening.
They just left, gave up.

26:31.507 --> 26:35.886
-It's too late for me, but for you--
-Oh, no. There's gotta be another way.

26:36.012 --> 26:37.722
Yeah, that's what I thought.

26:37.930 --> 26:40.057
I was cocky...

26:40.266 --> 26:42.852
...never actually thought I'd lose.

26:44.562 --> 26:46.230
But I was wrong.

26:47.481 --> 26:49.275
Dean...

26:49.692 --> 26:51.694
...I was wrong.

26:53.279 --> 26:55.448
I'm begging you.

26:56.324 --> 26:58.117
Say yes.

27:07.418 --> 27:09.587
But you won't.

27:11.339 --> 27:12.423
Because I didn't.

27:16.093 --> 27:18.512
Because that's just not us, is it?

27:27.813 --> 27:29.982
CHUCK:
So you're really from '09?

27:30.191 --> 27:31.317
DEAN:
Yeah, afraid so.

27:31.525 --> 27:32.735
Some free advice.

27:32.943 --> 27:36.280
Ever get back there,
you hoard toilet paper.

27:36.489 --> 27:37.782
Understand me? Hoard it.

27:37.990 --> 27:40.868
Hoard it like it's made of gold,
because it is.

27:41.077 --> 27:43.412
-Thanks, Chuck.
-Oh, you'll thank me, all right.

27:43.621 --> 27:45.498
Mark my words.

27:45.581 --> 27:49.335
-I'll see you around.
-Yeah. Okay.

28:07.645 --> 28:08.521
Let me see those.

28:09.397 --> 28:10.898
Want some?

28:12.566 --> 28:14.443
Amphetamines?

28:14.652 --> 28:17.571
It's the perfect antidote
to that absinthe.

28:20.199 --> 28:23.411
Don't get me wrong, Cass. I, uh....

28:23.619 --> 28:28.207
I'm happy that the stick is out
of your ass, but what's going on?

28:28.416 --> 28:31.502
What's with the drugs and the orgies
and The Love Guru crap?

28:33.337 --> 28:35.256
What's so funny?

28:35.589 --> 28:37.633
Dean, I'm not an angel anymore.

28:37.716 --> 28:39.802
-What?
-Yeah. I went mortal.

28:40.428 --> 28:41.554
What do you mean? How?

28:41.637 --> 28:44.515
It had something to do
with the other angels leaving.

28:44.598 --> 28:49.770
When they bailed, my mojo
just kind of, pchoo, drained away.

28:50.146 --> 28:53.274
Now, you know, practically human.

28:53.524 --> 28:55.067
I mean, Dean, I'm all but useless.

28:55.276 --> 28:58.404
Last year, broke my foot,
laid up for two months.

28:58.612 --> 28:59.613
-Wow.
-Yeah.

28:59.822 --> 29:01.699
So you're human.

29:03.617 --> 29:04.994
Well, welcome to the club.

29:05.202 --> 29:06.829
Thanks.

29:07.371 --> 29:10.624
Except I used to belong
to a much better club.

29:11.417 --> 29:12.668
I mean, now I'm powerless...

29:13.711 --> 29:14.837
...I'm hapless, I'm hopeless.

29:15.045 --> 29:19.758
I mean, why the hell not bury myself
in women and decadence?

29:19.967 --> 29:21.427
Right? It's the end, baby.

29:21.802 --> 29:23.471
That's what decadence is for.

29:23.679 --> 29:25.931
Why not bang a few gongs
before the lights go out?

29:27.975 --> 29:30.186
But that-- That's--

29:30.394 --> 29:32.813
That's just how I roll.

29:55.127 --> 29:58.589
There. Second floor window.
We go in there.

29:59.798 --> 30:01.717
RISA:
You sure about this?

30:01.800 --> 30:03.844
They'll never see us coming.

30:04.720 --> 30:05.846
Trust me.

30:06.472 --> 30:08.682
Now, weapons check,
we're on the move in 5.

30:08.891 --> 30:11.810
Hey, uh, me.

30:12.019 --> 30:14.021
Can I talk to you for a sec?

30:20.736 --> 30:21.946
Tell me what's going on.

30:22.154 --> 30:23.614
-What?
-I know you.

30:24.490 --> 30:27.326
You're lying to these people
and to me.

30:27.743 --> 30:29.995
-Is that so?
-Yeah.

30:30.621 --> 30:33.916
See, I know your lying expressions.
I've seen them in the mirror.

30:35.668 --> 30:38.170
-There's something you're not telling us.
-I don't know what you're talking about.

30:38.379 --> 30:42.091
Really? I don't seem to be the only member
of your posse with questions...

30:42.299 --> 30:44.760
...so maybe I'll just take my doubts
over to them.

30:44.843 --> 30:47.638
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait.

30:48.013 --> 30:50.266
-What?
-Take a look around you, man.

30:50.808 --> 30:52.935
This place should be white-hot
with Crotes.

30:53.644 --> 30:55.521
Where are they?

30:56.772 --> 30:59.316
They cleared a path for us...

30:59.692 --> 31:02.319
-...which means that this is--
-A trap. Exactly.

31:02.528 --> 31:05.114
-Then we can't go through the front.
-Oh, we're not.

31:05.322 --> 31:06.532
They are.

31:08.409 --> 31:12.079
They're the decoys. You and me,
we're going in through the back.

31:13.872 --> 31:17.960
You mean you're gonna
feed your friends into a meat grinder?

31:18.168 --> 31:20.170
Cass too?

31:20.671 --> 31:23.173
You're gonna use their deaths
as a diversion.

31:24.800 --> 31:26.969
Oh, man, something is broken in you.

31:27.970 --> 31:31.390
You're making decisions I'd never make.
I wouldn't sacrifice my friends.

31:31.599 --> 31:33.559
You're right. You wouldn't.

31:34.101 --> 31:37.396
It's one of the main reasons
we're in this mess, actually.

31:38.522 --> 31:40.858
These people count on you.
They trust you.

31:40.941 --> 31:44.236
They trust me to kill the devil
and to save the world...

31:44.320 --> 31:45.738
...and that's what I'll do.

31:45.821 --> 31:48.616
No. Not like this, you're not.
I'm not gonna let you.

31:48.699 --> 31:49.825
-Oh, really?
-Yeah--

31:52.703 --> 31:56.790
(AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE IN DISTANCE)

32:12.389 --> 32:15.142
(THUNDER CRASHES)

32:18.771 --> 32:20.731
(CRACKS)

32:24.902 --> 32:26.654
Oh.

32:27.488 --> 32:29.365
Hello, Dean.

32:36.997 --> 32:38.248
Aren't you a surprise?

32:40.292 --> 32:43.295
You've come a long way to see this,
haven't you?

32:48.842 --> 32:50.719
Well, go ahead.

32:51.261 --> 32:53.931
-Kill me.
-Kill you?

32:57.935 --> 33:00.479
Don't you think that would be
a little redundant?

33:04.149 --> 33:05.901
I'm sorry.

33:06.568 --> 33:12.074
It must be painful,
speaking to me in this shape.

33:12.282 --> 33:15.160
But it had to be your brother,
it had to be.

33:20.499 --> 33:23.377
You don't have to be afraid of me, Dean.

33:24.294 --> 33:26.338
What do you think I'm going to do?

33:27.923 --> 33:31.135
I don't know,
maybe deep-fry the planet?

33:32.553 --> 33:34.263
Why?

33:34.888 --> 33:38.225
Why would I want to destroy
this stunning thing?

33:38.726 --> 33:42.771
Beautiful in a trillion different ways...

33:42.980 --> 33:46.191
...the last perfect handiwork of God?

33:51.155 --> 33:53.198
Ever hear the story
of how I fell from grace?

33:53.449 --> 33:57.119
Oh, good God, you're not gonna tell me
a bedtime story, are you?

33:57.327 --> 33:58.996
My stomach's almost out of bile.

33:59.204 --> 34:01.123
You know why God cast me down?

34:04.001 --> 34:06.336
Because I loved him...

34:07.254 --> 34:08.464
...more than anything...

34:10.257 --> 34:11.842
...and then God created...

34:15.971 --> 34:17.389
...you.

34:19.349 --> 34:21.101
The little...

34:22.269 --> 34:24.021
...hairless apes.

34:25.105 --> 34:28.192
And then he asked all of us
to bow down before you...

34:28.776 --> 34:31.361
...to love you more than him...

34:33.030 --> 34:35.824
...and I said, "Father...

34:36.200 --> 34:37.826
...I can't."

34:38.494 --> 34:41.038
I said, "These human beings...

34:41.246 --> 34:43.373
...are flawed, murderous."

34:45.000 --> 34:47.044
And for that...

34:48.170 --> 34:52.591
...God had Michael cast me into hell.

34:53.217 --> 34:55.219
Now tell me...

34:56.053 --> 34:58.680
...does the punishment fit the crime?

34:59.515 --> 35:01.767
Especially when I was right.

35:03.644 --> 35:07.564
Look what 6 billion of you
have done to this thing...

35:08.565 --> 35:11.360
...and how many of you blame me
for it?

35:15.072 --> 35:16.907
You're not fooling me, you know that?

35:17.658 --> 35:20.410
With this sympathy-for-the devil crap.

35:21.537 --> 35:23.080
I know what you are.

35:24.414 --> 35:26.875
-What am I?
-You're the same thing, only bigger.

35:27.084 --> 35:31.171
The same brand of cockroach
I've been squashing my whole life.

35:31.880 --> 35:38.387
An ugly, evil, belly-to-the-ground,
supernatural piece of crap.

35:39.304 --> 35:43.225
The only difference
between them and you...

35:43.433 --> 35:45.727
...is the size of your ego.

35:54.444 --> 35:56.488
I like you, Dean.

35:57.406 --> 36:00.075
I get what the other angels see in you.

36:01.493 --> 36:03.370
Goodbye.

36:03.871 --> 36:05.914
We'll meet again soon.

36:08.584 --> 36:09.877
Better kill me now.

36:13.380 --> 36:15.883
-Pardon?
-You better kill me now...

36:16.091 --> 36:20.387
...or I swear I will find a way
to kill you...

36:21.555 --> 36:24.474
-...and I won't stop.
-I know you won't.

36:24.933 --> 36:27.769
I know you won't say yes
to Michael either...

36:28.520 --> 36:30.314
...and I know you won't kill Sam.

36:31.148 --> 36:33.400
Whatever you do...

36:33.483 --> 36:37.654
...you will always end up here.

36:37.946 --> 36:39.531
Whatever choices you make...

36:40.532 --> 36:45.746
...whatever details you alter,
we will always end up...

36:47.873 --> 36:49.374
...here.

36:51.710 --> 36:53.587
I win.

36:55.088 --> 36:56.924
So I win.

36:58.967 --> 37:00.802
You're wrong.

37:03.680 --> 37:05.390
See you in five years, Dean.

37:25.077 --> 37:28.872
Oh, well, if it isn't
the Ghost of Christmas Screw-You.

37:29.081 --> 37:30.290
Enough.

37:30.540 --> 37:31.708
Dean, enough.

37:33.085 --> 37:35.045
You saw it, right?
You saw what happens?

37:35.253 --> 37:39.049
You're the only person
who can prove the devil wrong.

37:39.383 --> 37:41.426
-Say yes.
-How do I know that this thing...

37:41.635 --> 37:43.887
...isn't one of your tricks, huh?

37:44.096 --> 37:45.389
Some angel hocus-pocus?

37:45.597 --> 37:47.057
The time for tricks is over.

37:48.642 --> 37:50.268
Give yourself to Michael.

37:50.852 --> 37:53.939
Say yes and we can strike...

37:54.606 --> 37:57.067
...before Lucifer gets to Sam...

37:57.275 --> 37:58.902
...before billions die.

38:20.966 --> 38:22.509
No.

38:24.261 --> 38:25.429
"No"?

38:27.139 --> 38:28.724
You haven't learned your lesson?

38:28.932 --> 38:32.519
Oh, I've learned a lesson, all right.
Just not the one you wanted to teach.

38:32.728 --> 38:35.564
Well, I'll just have to teach it again...

38:35.772 --> 38:39.901
...because I got you now, boy,
and I'm never letting you--

38:42.779 --> 38:43.905
Son of a--

38:47.701 --> 38:49.327
That's pretty nice timing, Cass.

38:49.703 --> 38:51.079
We had an appointment.

38:56.793 --> 38:58.378
Don't ever change.

39:00.672 --> 39:03.008
How did Zachariah find you?

39:03.633 --> 39:05.177
Long story.

39:05.385 --> 39:09.097
Let's just stay away from Jehovah's
Witnesses from now on, okay?

39:09.389 --> 39:11.183
What are you doing?

39:11.266 --> 39:14.144
Something I should have done
in the first place.

39:50.806 --> 39:52.390
Sam.

40:05.987 --> 40:08.406
If you're serious, you want back in...

40:12.202 --> 40:13.870
...you should hang onto this.

40:14.079 --> 40:15.622
I'm sure you're rusty.

40:23.880 --> 40:25.590
Look, man, I'm sorry.

40:27.217 --> 40:29.219
I don't know...

40:29.302 --> 40:32.264
...whatever I need to be, but I was...

40:33.223 --> 40:34.891
...wrong.

40:37.227 --> 40:39.354
What made you change your mind?

40:41.648 --> 40:43.483
Long story.

40:45.402 --> 40:47.404
The point is...

40:48.405 --> 40:50.782
...maybe we are
each other's Achilles' heel.

40:51.449 --> 40:55.203
Maybe they'll find a way to use us
against each other. I don't know.

40:58.290 --> 41:00.667
I just know we're all we've got.

41:05.130 --> 41:07.007
More than that.

41:09.092 --> 41:11.178
We keep each other human.

41:13.847 --> 41:15.390
Thank you.

41:16.850 --> 41:19.227
Really, thank you.

41:20.061 --> 41:22.022
-I won't let you down.
-Oh, I know it.

41:23.190 --> 41:26.276
I mean, you are the second best
hunter on the planet.

41:30.530 --> 41:31.907
So, what do we do now?

41:34.284 --> 41:36.244
We make our own future.

41:37.871 --> 41:39.247
Guess we have no choice.
