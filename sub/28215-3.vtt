00:18.502 --> 00:21.570
Hiya.

00:21.572 --> 00:23.639
Helen! Please!

00:23.641 --> 00:25.507
Please feel free to turn the lights on

00:25.509 --> 00:27.142
when you arrive in the morning.

00:27.144 --> 00:29.493
The day I become a member
of the custodial union,

00:29.518 --> 00:30.683
I certainly will, Dale.

00:30.708 --> 00:32.842
That is not one of the rules.

00:33.017 --> 00:35.551
Now I can see what I'm doing here.

00:43.044 --> 00:44.448
- Hi, Ralph.
- Good morning, Helen.

00:44.473 --> 00:46.306
Oh, the morning
announcements are just...

00:46.331 --> 00:47.664
we're just chock full of 'em.

00:47.689 --> 00:49.636
And we can't be late like yesterday.

00:49.661 --> 00:50.941
Check this one out.

00:51.689 --> 00:53.756
"Don't eat the broccoli in the cafeteria

00:53.781 --> 00:56.114
or you'll get birth
defects." Helen, what is this?

00:56.139 --> 00:57.735
Food services couldn't get in the door,

00:57.760 --> 00:59.893
so they left everything
for the whole week

00:59.918 --> 01:02.120
on the front lawn, and
then the landscapers came

01:02.145 --> 01:04.144
and blasted the whole
thing with Roundup.

01:04.194 --> 01:05.861
So the broccoli got the brunt of it

01:05.886 --> 01:07.476
because it's in bags with holes.

01:07.501 --> 01:10.001
Well, Helen, just tell them
to throw the broccoli out.

01:10.026 --> 01:12.304
What if the announcement
is, "Don't eat broccoli

01:12.329 --> 01:14.329
out of the trash, now more than ever?"

01:14.452 --> 01:16.118
- Make it sound positive.
- Okay.

01:16.143 --> 01:19.111
Speaking of announcements,
you got 28 minutes, kid.

01:19.136 --> 01:20.569
Oh, gosh.

01:20.594 --> 01:22.831
- Hi.
- Happy hump day, Jack.

01:22.856 --> 01:26.011
- All right.
- Or, for my dogs, that's every day.

01:26.035 --> 01:28.168
It can mean just about
anything to them, you know?

01:28.170 --> 01:30.338
Hello, good-bye, I like your style.

01:30.363 --> 01:31.605
- Oh.
- Hey, you're in my yard.

01:31.607 --> 01:32.989
- Get out of here.
- Yeah.

01:33.014 --> 01:34.281
You know, I'm gonna kill you someday.

01:34.305 --> 01:35.593
Oh, I'm gonna kill you first.

01:35.618 --> 01:37.820
- No, really, you drive me nuts.
- Let's do it. You wanna go?

01:37.844 --> 01:40.077
- Guy... guys, let's... 
- Yeah.

01:40.079 --> 01:41.278
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

01:41.280 --> 01:42.673
- We got in trouble.
- Okay.

01:42.713 --> 01:44.880
Listen, Jack, I would
love to stay and chat,

01:44.882 --> 01:47.949
but these next 28 minutes
decide whether we grab

01:47.951 --> 01:52.454
the ram by the horns or
whether the rams kinda grab us.

01:52.456 --> 01:54.456
Well, the hooves...

01:54.458 --> 01:56.531
I guess it'd be a hug.

01:56.556 --> 01:58.223
Ram hug. Don't wanna get hugged.

01:58.398 --> 02:01.016
- That fell apart.
- Hey, early bird. What you need?

02:01.041 --> 02:02.821
Well, I'm just here early
doing a little research for

02:02.845 --> 02:05.775
- my new book about Toledo's working class.
- Mm-hmm.

02:05.800 --> 02:07.574
I was down in the
cafeteria observing Ronda

02:07.599 --> 02:09.530
and the lunch ladies
as they cheerfully made

02:09.555 --> 02:11.701
- about 200 breakfast burritos.
- Mmm.

02:11.703 --> 02:13.536
And then she was mixing up
about three vats of what she

02:13.538 --> 02:15.338
- was calling fiesta tots.
- Mmm.

02:15.340 --> 02:17.031
So, anyway, I just
need to type up my notes

02:17.056 --> 02:19.056
and I was hoping to do
that in my massage chair.

02:19.058 --> 02:21.926
And you have that, so, uh, give me it.

02:21.928 --> 02:23.091
Cricket nipples.

02:23.116 --> 02:25.052
- I gave it to Lynette in accounts payable.
- Oh.

02:25.077 --> 02:27.175
Because I read that if
you sit on a yoga ball...

02:27.200 --> 02:30.256
- Uh-huh.
- It really strengthens your groin.

02:30.281 --> 02:33.593
- Does it?
- So you don't have a dumpy groin.

02:33.618 --> 02:35.616
- Ah.
- And who wants a dumpy groin?

02:35.641 --> 02:37.289
So, sorry, where is... 
where is accounts payable?

02:37.313 --> 02:38.579
I'd like to go see this Lynette.

02:38.603 --> 02:40.203
Oh, it's that way. Left, two rights.

02:40.228 --> 02:41.656
- Left and two rights.
- Yeah. Okay.

02:41.681 --> 02:42.892
- Hi.
- Hi, Sarika.

02:42.917 --> 02:45.071
Here are all the violations
I witnessed so far today.

02:45.096 --> 02:46.496
Well, you'd better tell them to me.

02:46.520 --> 02:48.558
- Dale was ten minutes late this morning.
- Oh, my God.

02:48.582 --> 02:50.596
Travis Hexter put the
school up for sale on eBay.

02:50.647 --> 02:52.680
- It's at $300.
- That's pretty good.

02:52.705 --> 02:55.406
Anyway, back to this roofing debacle.

02:55.431 --> 02:57.788
The guy shows up, he's a half hour late.

02:57.813 --> 03:01.368
He comes in Mr. Fancy
carrying a coffee like he has

03:01.393 --> 03:03.507
not a care in the world. I...

03:03.532 --> 03:05.336
Hi, is this accounts payable?

03:05.361 --> 03:06.790
I was wondering if I
could ask you to part ways

03:06.814 --> 03:08.114
- with that chair because... 
- No, no.

03:08.138 --> 03:09.905
I run the school's social media.

03:09.930 --> 03:11.528
Lynette's payroll.

03:11.553 --> 03:13.780
Anyway, my husband says to the guy,

03:13.805 --> 03:16.138
"How much to get the
whole roof reshingled?"

03:16.163 --> 03:18.096
The guy says, "Eight thou."

03:18.121 --> 03:20.305
He says, "Eight thou? Fat chance."

03:20.330 --> 03:21.868
Hello.

03:21.893 --> 03:23.383
Hi, I'm Jack.

03:23.408 --> 03:25.282
I hate to tell you this,
but you're sitting on a chair

03:25.306 --> 03:27.206
that I technically bought so, you know,

03:27.208 --> 03:29.642
bottom line is, that's my chair.

03:29.644 --> 03:32.845
It's weird to say it's yours
just because you bought it.

03:32.847 --> 03:34.026
Do you know what I mean?

03:34.051 --> 03:36.822
I bought that chipmunk,
but he doesn't belong to me.

03:36.847 --> 03:38.246
He belongs to the world.

03:38.271 --> 03:40.004
Actually, yes, you're
making a very valid

03:40.029 --> 03:42.797
philosophical point. No
one really owns anything.

03:43.297 --> 03:45.230
Nice, nice.

03:45.660 --> 03:47.660
- It was Jack, right?
- Yeah.

03:47.662 --> 03:49.862
Yeah, I was named after my grandfather.

03:49.864 --> 03:52.164
"My grandfather," very formal.

03:52.166 --> 03:54.333
I think I see what's going on here.

03:54.335 --> 03:57.603
You grew up around
horses, didn't you, Jack?

03:57.605 --> 03:59.722
Which was nice because Mommy and Daddy

03:59.747 --> 04:01.526
wouldn't give you a little brother.

04:01.551 --> 04:04.385
After high school, you ran off to Egypt.

04:04.410 --> 04:06.877
That is, until Daddy said
it's time to come home.

04:06.902 --> 04:08.902
He pulled strings to
get you into Kent State,

04:08.927 --> 04:13.196
a nice little place where you
pledged Beta and played soccer.

04:13.221 --> 04:16.555
But that was too big a pond
for this fish, wasn't it?

04:16.624 --> 04:20.226
So you came crawling back
home to breed your pit bulls

04:20.228 --> 04:23.763
and blow your family's
fortune on online poker.

04:26.701 --> 04:28.267
None of that is right.

04:28.269 --> 04:30.035
Yeah.

04:30.037 --> 04:31.837
But can you imagine if it was?

04:33.710 --> 04:35.543
One, two, three, four!

04:35.568 --> 04:38.602
♪ Next time, I'll listen to my heart ♪

04:38.627 --> 04:41.461

04:50.625 --> 04:51.991
He was peeing in the pool,

04:52.016 --> 04:54.370
- and he wasn't even swimming in it.
- Oy.

04:54.395 --> 04:58.297
Thank you, Sarika. Dave,
have you lost weight?

04:58.651 --> 05:00.984
I keep telling you, I have a parasite.

05:01.009 --> 05:02.942
Oh.

05:02.967 --> 05:04.734
Don't write that down.

05:04.839 --> 05:07.406
Helen, my office is freezing.

05:07.408 --> 05:09.341
The radiator isn't hissing
like it usually does.

05:09.343 --> 05:10.902
- I'm on it, Ralph.
- Okay.

05:10.927 --> 05:13.795
Oh, Coach, thank you for
jumping in last minute

05:13.820 --> 05:15.720
- for that crossing guard.
- No problem.

05:15.850 --> 05:17.917
It's a real shame about Eugene.

05:17.919 --> 05:20.917
- If I had my way, no one would ever die.
- I hear you,

05:20.942 --> 05:22.999
although I do worry
that the overpopulation

05:23.024 --> 05:24.290
would lead to people eatin' each other.

05:24.292 --> 05:25.958
- True.
- Right.

05:25.960 --> 05:28.861
Oh, I didn't realize
there were readin' glasses

05:28.863 --> 05:31.630
in the pocket here. These
must have been Eugene's.

05:31.632 --> 05:33.098
- Oh.
- Yeah, should we, uh...

05:33.100 --> 05:35.100
Well, I'm sure his family would want me

05:35.102 --> 05:37.102
to just pitch those.

05:39.440 --> 05:41.307
Anything else in the pockets? Nothin'.

05:41.309 --> 05:43.175
Nothin', really, nope.

05:43.177 --> 05:45.110
Oh, pardon me. Comin' out.

05:45.112 --> 05:46.825
Faculty comin' out. Move way.

05:46.850 --> 05:49.384
Oh, here come the hornies.

05:58.059 --> 06:00.292
Mm, that's...

06:00.294 --> 06:02.646
What's going on? Why are you early?

06:02.671 --> 06:05.141
Well, I... I, uh, I
spent the morning studying

06:05.166 --> 06:07.900
Ronda and the lunch gals,
and then I went to get

06:07.902 --> 06:10.650
my massage chair from this payroll lady,

06:10.675 --> 06:13.216
but she refused and did this sort of

06:13.241 --> 06:15.474
verbal jiu-jitsu thing on me.

06:15.476 --> 06:17.476
I couldn't tell what was
a joke and what wasn't.

06:17.478 --> 06:20.846
There was just something about her.

06:22.817 --> 06:25.885
Um, are you about to sing?

06:25.887 --> 06:30.609
No, no, uh, I'm never
about to sing, Anthony.

06:30.634 --> 06:34.615
Murph... Murphy and
Nagel. Yeah, that's it.

06:34.640 --> 06:35.710
"The Myth of Ownership."

06:35.735 --> 06:37.735
Yeah, I... I just figured
out what she was quoting.

06:38.587 --> 06:42.589
I shall have my chair. I shall have
it by the time school starts.

06:47.019 --> 06:49.153

07:28.373 --> 07:29.806
Welcome to the meat locker.

07:37.549 --> 07:39.211
Hey, Victor, look up.

07:43.888 --> 07:45.621
Okay, Ralph,

07:45.623 --> 07:48.110
this guy's gonna get
the heating working ASAP.

07:48.135 --> 07:49.559
All right.

07:49.561 --> 07:52.728
A...

07:52.730 --> 07:54.548
Okay, here's something sad.

07:54.573 --> 07:57.095
Somebody put a hamster
in the vending machine,

07:57.120 --> 07:58.626
and it's stuck in G9.

07:59.745 --> 08:00.977
He's $2, Ralph.

08:02.815 --> 08:05.782
- He's $2, Ralph.
- All right, here.

08:05.784 --> 08:07.150
- Oh.
- There you go.

08:07.152 --> 08:08.919
Oh, they tallied the students' votes

08:08.921 --> 08:10.620
for the new football stadium name.

08:10.622 --> 08:11.688
Oh, what name won?

08:11.690 --> 08:13.423
It's a write-in.

08:13.425 --> 08:14.825
It's Boner Palace.

08:17.162 --> 08:18.829
- Hi, Ralph.
- Hey.

08:18.831 --> 08:20.964
So I have to admit, it was very hard

08:20.966 --> 08:23.541
to sum up 94 years of a man's life,

08:23.566 --> 08:25.702
but I think I have a pretty solid eulogy

08:25.704 --> 08:27.704
- for our crossing guard.
- Ooh.

08:27.706 --> 08:29.272
You still want this on the
morning announcements, right?

08:29.274 --> 08:31.675
Absolutely. I loved Eu... Eugene.

08:31.677 --> 08:34.211
Wow, uh, this is...

08:34.212 --> 08:35.779
This is really long.

08:35.780 --> 08:38.014
Um, anything you can
cut out of this, maybe?

08:38.015 --> 08:39.816
And quickly, if possible.

08:39.818 --> 08:42.184
Well, I guess we could skip the part

08:42.187 --> 08:44.688
- about his marital affairs.
- Mmm.

08:44.690 --> 08:45.989
Although that's my favorite section.

08:45.991 --> 08:48.892
Mm, you know what...

08:50.963 --> 08:52.219
Oh, hey, Mary?

08:52.244 --> 08:53.752
I see you're on the phone there.

08:53.777 --> 08:56.911
I just wanted to say that I
got $10 of my own money here.

08:56.936 --> 08:58.946
I really didn't even
need to interrupt ya.

08:58.971 --> 09:00.871
There's no headline
here. This is my money.

09:00.873 --> 09:03.673
Hey, uh, Mary, do you know a
Lynette that works in payro...

09:03.675 --> 09:05.075
Oh, I'm sorry, you're on the phone.

09:07.246 --> 09:09.145
That begs the question,
why were you talking to her?

09:09.147 --> 09:10.981
Hey, I got ten of my own dollars here.

09:10.983 --> 09:12.349
What's with the third degree?

09:12.851 --> 09:14.384
Okay.

09:14.386 --> 09:17.153
I says, "When do you think
the roof will be done?"

09:17.155 --> 09:20.156
He says, "In the summer."
I says, "Like hell."

09:20.158 --> 09:21.648
I got a lot of things to do.

09:21.673 --> 09:23.827
Murphy and Nagel.

09:23.829 --> 09:26.162
Touché, touché. Yeah, yeah.

09:26.164 --> 09:27.831
I forgot about Murphy and Nagel's

09:27.833 --> 09:29.866
"The Myth of Ownership."

09:29.868 --> 09:31.701
- My chair, please.
- What's happening?

09:31.703 --> 09:34.104
Well, uh, what we were
talking about before.

09:34.106 --> 09:35.372
You know how you were saying, like,

09:35.374 --> 09:37.310
that nobody really owns anything.

09:37.335 --> 09:39.342
I realized you were
quoting Murphy and Nagel.

09:39.344 --> 09:41.513
Yeah, were you a philosophy major?

09:41.538 --> 09:44.114
I did not give my money
to one of those places.

09:44.116 --> 09:46.227
Did you really go to
school for four years

09:46.252 --> 09:48.385
to learn something that
is kind of common sense?

09:48.387 --> 09:50.921
I... I did, yeah.

09:50.923 --> 09:52.188
Nine years, actually.

09:52.190 --> 09:54.758
Love that.

09:54.760 --> 09:58.862
So you got the other
type of doctor title.

09:58.864 --> 10:00.864
- I did, yeah.
- Thank you.

10:00.866 --> 10:02.933
Uh, yeah, which is why I also know about

10:02.935 --> 10:05.368
Robert Nozick's rebuttal
to Murphy and Nagel.

10:05.370 --> 10:07.037
Not sure if you're familiar
with a little book called

10:07.039 --> 10:08.772
"What's Mine is Mine."

10:08.774 --> 10:10.907
Are we not...

10:17.291 --> 10:18.625
_

10:18.627 --> 10:20.114
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

10:20.139 --> 10:22.139
I think in order to get
my, uh, massage chair

10:22.164 --> 10:23.692
back from this Lynette,

10:23.717 --> 10:25.976
I'm gonna need to know
everything about her.

10:26.001 --> 10:28.068
I just can't figure
out how someone like her

10:28.070 --> 10:30.437
could be a payroll employee
in Toledo, you know.

10:30.439 --> 10:33.106
You know what, Sarika, I
bet you've got some intel

10:33.108 --> 10:35.742
on Lynette in that good old
snitch notebook of yours, hmm?

10:40.414 --> 10:41.891
Lynette Marie Hofstadter.

10:41.916 --> 10:44.751
Drives a very large Buick
that takes up two spaces.

10:44.753 --> 10:46.207
Takes frequent smoke breaks which,

10:46.232 --> 10:48.432
although not against a
rule, are immoral because

10:48.457 --> 10:50.745
she's not smoking.
It's an empty vape pen.

10:52.740 --> 10:54.824
Yo, she's actually out there right now.

10:54.849 --> 10:56.282
- For real?
- For real.

10:56.432 --> 10:57.631
Where, where, where, where, where?

10:57.633 --> 10:59.599
Ooh, she is. Yep, checkmate.

10:59.601 --> 11:02.202
Okay, um, I'm gonna go
get my chair right now.

11:02.204 --> 11:05.305
Uh, Marcus, Anthony,
um, you guys distract her

11:05.307 --> 11:07.214
if she tries to come back in, okay?
Let's go. Come on.

11:07.238 --> 11:09.138
Let's go. Come on, come on.

11:09.268 --> 11:10.962
What's up, man?

11:10.987 --> 11:12.345
Come on. Can we... can we do this?

11:12.347 --> 11:15.148
You're gonna have to adjust to my pace.

11:15.150 --> 11:16.310
So slow.

11:16.335 --> 11:17.349
Okay.

11:31.241 --> 11:32.341
Oh!

11:36.138 --> 11:38.038
Ah!

11:42.678 --> 11:44.644
Oh!

11:46.482 --> 11:47.575
If you're looking for any feedback,

11:47.599 --> 11:49.060
it is plenty warm.

11:49.085 --> 11:51.829
Ralph, I thought you should
know that the algebra teachers

11:51.854 --> 11:53.687
are having a huge argument on the lawn.

11:53.689 --> 11:56.030
Ken was like, "You still owe me $200."

11:56.055 --> 11:58.843
And Vivek was like, "Well, how
about you take this instead?"

11:58.868 --> 12:00.504
And he grabbed her right by the groin

12:00.529 --> 12:02.829
and he's twisting, and there's F-bombs

12:02.831 --> 12:05.565
- just raining down.
- Hit them with the sprinklers.

12:05.567 --> 12:07.767
Call Vivek's wife.
Tell her to bring $200.

12:07.769 --> 12:11.605
Tell her to come immediately.

12:11.607 --> 12:14.241
Come on, baby. Come on!

12:23.585 --> 12:25.552
- Your cousin again?
- Yeah.

12:25.554 --> 12:27.687
We fight a lot, but,
at the end of the day,

12:27.689 --> 12:29.356
it's okay 'cause we
really do hate each other.

12:29.358 --> 12:30.523
Mm-hmm, yeah.

12:30.548 --> 12:32.423
You know, speaking of hate,
did you see those two dudes

12:32.447 --> 12:35.014
fighting out front? I
love a morning skirmish.

12:35.039 --> 12:37.022
Punching somebody with a
belly full of scrambled eggs?

12:37.046 --> 12:38.609
Mary, Mary?

12:38.634 --> 12:39.900
May I please have a moment, please?

12:39.902 --> 12:41.668
Oh, sure, Coach.

12:45.229 --> 12:47.296
Let's see.

12:49.211 --> 12:50.877
Gross.

12:50.879 --> 12:52.746
Hazelnut? Just...

12:55.584 --> 12:58.418
Oh, no. Oh, it's so wet.

12:58.420 --> 13:00.253
Okay.

13:00.255 --> 13:03.256
You got this. Okay.

13:03.258 --> 13:05.225
Face. She got a neck,

13:05.733 --> 13:08.732
- old neck, saggy neck, okay.
- What's up, Coach?

13:08.733 --> 13:11.708
Mary, I told you that
this $10 bill was my own,

13:11.733 --> 13:14.568
but that was a gol dang it lie.

13:14.570 --> 13:17.470
If I told you every gol dang
it lie that I tell in a day,

13:17.472 --> 13:18.672
girl, you would call the police.

13:18.674 --> 13:22.442
Mary, I stole this from Eugene.

13:22.444 --> 13:24.311
Eugene who...

13:24.313 --> 13:25.745
- Passed away of old age, yeah.
- Yeah.

13:25.747 --> 13:28.748
Him. This is a dead man's ten.

13:28.750 --> 13:30.951
I am a liar and a thief

13:30.953 --> 13:33.687
- and it's killing me.
- Coach, it's fine.

13:33.689 --> 13:35.288
Dead people don't shop.

13:35.290 --> 13:37.257
Just, uh, go get yourself
a breakfast sandwich

13:37.259 --> 13:39.759
- or some waffles.
- How about a burrito?

13:39.761 --> 13:42.329
- Sure.
- 'Cause I'd prefer a burrito.

13:42.331 --> 13:44.264
Yeah, okay, very cool. Very cool, man.

13:44.266 --> 13:45.632
- Okay.
- All right, there you go.

13:45.634 --> 13:47.467
Right, not supposed to have tortillas,

13:47.469 --> 13:49.502
but I think I can make an exception.

13:49.504 --> 13:53.019
So the roofing guy's looking
at me, and I'm looking at him.

13:53.044 --> 13:54.167
My husband looks at me,

13:54.192 --> 13:56.159
but I'm still looking at the other guy.

13:56.184 --> 13:58.531
You got all three of us in
some kind of messed up...

13:58.556 --> 14:00.422
Oh!

14:09.636 --> 14:12.503
And I can tell you...

14:14.441 --> 14:16.942
_

14:16.966 --> 14:20.995
We are locked in a battle of wits
with a worthy opponent.

14:21.020 --> 14:22.391
That girl you have a crush on?

14:22.416 --> 14:24.883
I'm an adult, Marcus.
I don't get crushes.

14:24.908 --> 14:27.220
No, I... but I have come
up with a fairly genius plan

14:27.245 --> 14:28.813
to get my chair back.
Now, follow me here.

14:28.837 --> 14:31.337
It involves capturing a
deer, pref... preferably one

14:31.362 --> 14:32.629
with a broken leg,
otherwise we're gonna have

14:32.653 --> 14:34.980
- to break it.
- I'll do it!

14:35.005 --> 14:36.604
- You'll break the deer's leg?
- Yeah.

14:36.629 --> 14:37.676
Okay, great.

14:37.701 --> 14:40.028
So we know that Lynette locks
the chair when she goes out

14:40.053 --> 14:42.058
for a fake smoke, but,
uh, I think if she hears

14:42.083 --> 14:43.883
an injured, braying deer
in the hall, she might...

14:43.907 --> 14:46.508
If I can bray convincingly,
can we not have Grace

14:46.533 --> 14:49.000
break the deer's leg?

14:49.331 --> 14:51.171
Yeah, fine. Let's hear it.

15:03.185 --> 15:04.518
We have our deer.

15:10.957 --> 15:12.390
Get the hell out of here!

15:37.286 --> 15:40.253
Girl, I think I might
be Coach's only friend.

15:40.278 --> 15:41.992
I'm like, "I didn't sign up for that."

15:42.017 --> 15:44.577
No.

15:49.397 --> 15:52.598
This is rough.

15:52.623 --> 15:54.289
Stef, look at this.

15:54.314 --> 15:55.747
The assignment was to create

15:55.772 --> 15:58.306
a photorealistic portrait
of your grandmother,

15:58.331 --> 16:01.432
not draw a circle with a dang
Panera French loaf on top.

16:03.027 --> 16:04.982
You know what? That... 
that is just mean.

16:05.007 --> 16:06.112
Okay?

16:06.137 --> 16:09.230
Because I think this... this
is very good, if you ask me,

16:09.255 --> 16:11.455
okay, very, very good.

16:11.480 --> 16:14.815
I mean, to... to me, if you
were to say to m... to ask me

16:14.840 --> 16:18.021
if this was very, very good,
this is... you know, so...

16:18.046 --> 16:19.412
I drew this, okay,

16:19.437 --> 16:21.437
because I spit your nasty-ass coffee

16:21.462 --> 16:23.162
all over Jason's grandma.

16:23.187 --> 16:25.487
And you know I'm not a good droor.

16:25.512 --> 16:27.145
Do you mean drawer?

16:27.170 --> 16:29.537
Well, it's spelled
like a dr... a drawer.

16:29.562 --> 16:31.428
I... I say droor.

16:31.453 --> 16:33.187
D... droor? Draw-were?

16:33.212 --> 16:36.813
Anyways, I mean, what are we
gonna tell poor little Jason?

16:43.247 --> 16:44.536
This is a very good plan, and I...

16:44.560 --> 16:46.027
and I think it could work.

16:46.052 --> 16:48.270
A lot of it does ride on
whether Ronda the lunch lady

16:48.295 --> 16:50.232
can do an Australian accent,
but I... I bet she can do it.

16:50.256 --> 16:51.301
- Uh... 
- Yep.

16:51.326 --> 16:54.060
Crikey, mate, I'll take a crack at it.

16:55.323 --> 16:57.056
Solid. That's very, very good.

16:57.081 --> 16:58.612
But, if you're doing that,
who's gonna pop out

16:58.636 --> 17:00.170
of the Amazon box, you know what I mean?

17:00.194 --> 17:02.261
I think we got something here. I do.

17:02.318 --> 17:04.651
You guys ready? All right.

17:04.833 --> 17:06.433
Here we go.

17:06.435 --> 17:10.200
Ralph, the hamster,
we got him out from G9,

17:10.224 --> 17:14.881
but he tumbled down
to H16, so he's $4 now.

17:14.906 --> 17:16.804
- Damn it.
- I'll... I'll get it.

17:16.829 --> 17:18.219
Michelle, do you have something nice

17:18.242 --> 17:19.843
and short for me?

17:19.867 --> 17:21.667
"Hey, that crossing guard is dead.

17:21.693 --> 17:24.127
He was a proud vet who killed
a lot of Japanese people

17:24.153 --> 17:25.769
and cheated on his wife.

17:25.794 --> 17:28.695
But today let us think of
Eugene in his orange vest

17:28.720 --> 17:30.387
watching over all of us,

17:30.412 --> 17:33.217
watching everything we do."

17:33.242 --> 17:35.508
Oh, what have I become?

17:42.726 --> 17:44.526
I believe there's an
injured deer in the hall.

17:44.873 --> 17:47.440
Well, according to state, the fire...

17:47.442 --> 17:49.142
That sounded great, dude.

17:49.144 --> 17:51.478
Now he's here on Tuesday.

17:51.480 --> 17:53.880
Well, Tuesday's the day
they do street sweeping.

17:53.882 --> 17:56.606
- Leverage.
- So I says to the roofing guy, Bruce,

17:56.631 --> 17:59.440
"You gotta move your truck or
it's gonna get towed"

17:59.465 --> 18:01.568
He says, "My name's not Bruce."

18:01.593 --> 18:06.029
I says, "Who the hell are
you, been on my roof all day?"

18:06.061 --> 18:07.905
Hey, there.

18:07.930 --> 18:10.808
This is your teacher's chair so...

18:10.833 --> 18:12.333
Oh, wow.

18:19.031 --> 18:21.598
Hey.

18:25.834 --> 18:27.300
Oh my God, I did it.

18:27.302 --> 18:29.341
I found the Toledo Strangler.

18:30.785 --> 18:32.084
Yeah, no, this... that's funny.

18:32.109 --> 18:35.317
Um, this is actually all 100% biology,

18:35.342 --> 18:38.009
and it's not a crazy
plan to get my chair back.

18:38.034 --> 18:39.801
Although it does say right there,

18:39.826 --> 18:41.759
"Get my chair back from Lynette."

18:41.784 --> 18:43.933
Do you think you're the only
Lynette in this whole school

18:43.957 --> 18:46.257
that has a chair that I want?

18:46.282 --> 18:47.382
My mistake.

18:49.598 --> 18:50.998
Just gonna grab this.

18:51.023 --> 18:52.622
That's mine.

18:52.647 --> 18:54.113
Thanks, yep.

18:54.138 --> 18:56.606
You got it.

18:57.153 --> 18:58.419
Wipe out.

19:07.249 --> 19:10.651
Non-athlete, do you want this burrito?

19:10.676 --> 19:12.342
Sure.

19:12.367 --> 19:15.668
It belongs to a dead man.

19:20.778 --> 19:22.006
The curse is yours now.

19:24.782 --> 19:28.005
I am so sick and tired of
you guys spitting coffee

19:28.030 --> 19:29.184
on each other's artwork.

19:29.209 --> 19:32.514
'Cause this sweet nugget
of a boy does not deserve

19:32.539 --> 19:35.108
to have coffee spat on his art.

19:35.133 --> 19:37.389
The madness has got to stop.

19:37.414 --> 19:39.881
Look at this sweet little egg.

19:39.906 --> 19:42.974
I mean, who would wanna hurt
these sweet baby egg cheeks?

19:42.999 --> 19:45.433
- Who would do that?
- Who would do that?

19:45.458 --> 19:46.883
Oh, time to ring the bell. Toot, toot.

19:46.907 --> 19:48.067
Oh, time to ring the biz-ell.

20:00.133 --> 20:05.803
♪ I don't believe I'll
fall in love today ♪

20:07.828 --> 20:09.539
Hey, hey, Lynette.

20:09.564 --> 20:11.831
Uh, I...

20:11.856 --> 20:13.592
I have a really embarrassing confession.

20:13.617 --> 20:15.650
- I stole your chipmunk.
- Oh, my God.

20:15.675 --> 20:17.842
And I'm sorry. And here you go.

20:20.658 --> 20:22.958
Yeah, I have a confession to make too.

20:22.983 --> 20:24.783
I stole your wallet off your desk.

20:24.808 --> 20:27.509
- Oh.
- You know what?

20:27.534 --> 20:29.299
- You keep the chipmunk.
- Really?

20:29.324 --> 20:30.409
Yeah.

20:30.434 --> 20:32.994
I'll figure out a way to get him back.

20:33.863 --> 20:35.630
You know what? Keep my wallet.

20:35.655 --> 20:37.821
Yeah, I'll figure out
a way... actually, no.

20:37.846 --> 20:38.981
Uh, no, I... I need that back.

20:39.005 --> 20:41.090
- That's... that's got my money in it.
- That's fair.

20:46.466 --> 20:47.971
Ten seconds.

20:47.996 --> 20:50.010
All right, give me a tight,
short eulogy, Michelle.

20:50.035 --> 20:53.120
Uh, Eugene cheated on his wife and died.

20:53.145 --> 20:54.221
Nailed. It.

20:54.246 --> 20:56.579
Five, four...

20:56.604 --> 20:59.348
Oh, jeez, the east
bathroom's flooding big time.

20:59.373 --> 21:00.939
The east... are you... flooding?

21:00.964 --> 21:05.033
- Three, two, one.
- Hello, faculty and students.

21:05.058 --> 21:06.237
I'm Principal Durbin,

21:06.262 --> 21:08.262
and these are your
morning announcements.

21:08.548 --> 21:10.381
Let's grab today by the horns

21:10.406 --> 21:13.474
and make this a wonderful
Whitlock Wednesday.

21:14.102 --> 21:18.905
We got lots, we got lots,
we got lots of tater tots.
