whether Americans

15:23.545 --> 15:27.399
They will shed their
blood on foreign soil.

15:29.154 --> 15:33.008
It's nice when you have a friend,
ready to give you a weapon.

15:36.547 --> 15:38.892
Even more preferably,

To celebrate our victory.

19:21.697 --> 19:23.780

20:07.710 --> 20:09.793
Thank you.

20:11.012 --> 20:13.095
I recognized you immediately.

20:14.004 --> 20:17.579
And ... what you
told Sonia about me?

20:19.256 --> 20:22.780
He told me to shave,
sprayed with cologne

20:22.953 --> 20:26.472

20:26.597 --> 20:29.895

- And so?

20:32.197 --> 20:34.657
No, he told me, to see
you in a bathing suit

20:34.783 --> 20:38.273
and to understand that should
immediately marry you.

20:39.615 --> 20:41.698
And did you know him?

20:42.487 --> 20:44.570
Boris.

20:47.617 --> 20:49.700
Lyudmila.

20:52.051 --> 20:54.633
But if we are serious ...
- Aviators are!

20:54.899 --> 20:56.982
I need time.

21:02.527 --> 21:05.644
Yes ... very interesting
book Ludal.

21:06.461 --> 21:09.367
So you say Ludal.
I'm very pleased.

21:09.737 --> 21:11.522
Lyudmila! - Masha.

21:11.695 --> 21:15.547
As we promised, we invite you
To celebrate our victory.

21:15.721 --> 21:18.356
And you, young man,
you are welcome.

21:19.675 --> 21:21.473
I disagree with you.

21:21.647 --> 21:25.957
How can you be against war? Only
it will create a fairer world.

21:26.083 --> 21:28.177
And we will create it!

21:28.350 --> 21:31.421
No, your opinion is very
popular today, I know.

21:31.650 --> 21:33.813
But I never believed in it.

21:34.930 --> 21:38.559
So vain popinjay, there
will be no such war.

21:41.254 --> 21:44.347
Above is better. The
war has already begun.

21:44.472 --> 21:48.601
But you are afraid to admit it.
And this is your weakness.

21:48.727 --> 21:50.810
Why? - Because you're a coward.

21:51.462 --> 21:55.364
Want others to protect
family, country, your wife.

21:55.490 --> 21:57.933
And you can you protect someone?

21:58.675 --> 22:01.933
To protect ... not. But
to save him - yes!

22:05.485 --> 22:07.224
It occurred to me toast.

22:07.397 --> 22:09.480
Drink to, but ...

22:09.850 --> 22:13.484
For the ball, which bounced right!

- Thank you, Nicholas, on Sunday.

22:25.133 --> 22:28.275

Ludal and Masha home.

22:28.448 --> 22:32.196
At lunch. See it stands silent.
A girls almost flew.

22:32.322 --> 22:35.892

22:36.710 --> 22:40.704
Lyudmila, take the example of Masha.
Or it can fly.

22:46.634 --> 22:50.997
So you're an only child. - Only.

22:52.631 --> 22:54.752
And where you live in Kiev?

22:55.189 --> 22:58.791
In the house you live in or block?
- In block.

22:58.965 --> 23:01.290

- This is not nonsense.

23:15.363 --> 23:20.830
Ludmila, say, have you how
many children you will have.

23:21.997 --> 23:24.080
How many guys. And
in general ...

23:25.467 --> 23:28.049
What you care most
about her husband.

23:28.206 --> 23:30.289
Winning well, loves you?

23:31.397 --> 23:35.659
Dad, Mom, do not tire yourself in our

23:39.910 --> 23:42.162

23:42.335 --> 23:45.483

- Oh, I'll tell you.

23:45.713 --> 23:49.398
Wrestling is our big problem.
He is a very good boy.

23:49.572 --> 23:54.641
Everything from Odessa invested in it.

23:54.814 --> 23:57.371
And how difficult accepted
Medicine in Odessa?

23:57.497 --> 24:00.927
You know what they said about him?
- That has golden hands.

24:01.052 --> 24:05.657
Lyusik, now in Kiev is known!
- But this is not important!

24:06.467 --> 24:11.029
My son can make a man
to yourself happy!

24:11.627 --> 24:15.871
And when he meets this woman
will and gave a wedding ring!

24:16.044 --> 24:18.904
Wrestling, bring the
ring, Show it to Lyusya!

24:20.219 --> 24:25.317
Lyudmila ... do not expect much.
The ring is not very expensive.

24:25.491 --> 24:28.810
When Lyusik gave me a ring ...
- not even gold.

24:28.935 --> 24:32.959
... He straightened more than Deribas!
- We have another value.

24:33.085 --> 24:35.456

24:58.848 --> 25:00.931
Did you understand?

25:07.067 --> 25:09.430
Did you know about what "later"?

25:09.660 --> 25:14.759
You laugh? Turn on the radio.

26:31.142 --> 26:33.225
To enter, we'll be late.

26:50.018 --> 26:53.385
Ludal, you are not
obliged to do so.

26:58.715 --> 27:01.031
War is no place for women.

27:02.665 --> 27:06.269
War is no place for cowards.
- Youths quiet!

27:21.330 --> 27:23.413

masters for the right shot.

28:05.976 --> 28:08.059
And I'm needed there.

28:10.083 --> 28:12.583
You fight go. Go to the opera.

28:19.136 --> 28:21.219
Ludal. Ludal!

28:40.980 --> 28:42.740
Here we are foreign.

28:42.914 --> 28:45.151
<i> Embassy of the USSR in
the USA 1942 ?. </i>

28:45.277 --> 28:47.360
There's a war, and here ...

28:48.544 --> 28:53.430
Here care whether my underwear
Silk is and what is my lipstick.

28:55.809 --> 28:58.531
Ludal, can you explain
what is that ?!

29:07.836 --> 29:11.090
What whispers in English
the wife of the president?

29:11.216 --> 29:15.076
What counsel? - can
you tell us normal?

29:18.167 --> 29:21.511
Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt
invited Miss Pavlichenko

29:21.684 --> 29:26.082
to live in the White House
during visit her in America.

29:26.255 --> 29:29.584
And only invites
Miss Pavlichenko!

29:31.393 --> 29:34.276
Do we have any instruction
in this occasion?

29:34.402 --> 29:39.400
Soviet citizen has not remained
White House without its delegation.

29:41.199 --> 29:43.386
I can not go anywhere!

29:51.459 --> 29:54.181
We must cling every chance.

29:54.380 --> 29:59.615
In the presidential house solve important
questions. Good to have our man.

30:07.721 --> 30:09.804
M-to ...

30:12.611 --> 30:15.544
You know what, Miss Pavlichenko?

30:17.162 --> 30:19.358
Decide you alone!

30:32.262 --> 30:37.262
Next week will be hot. Do not you
want to update her wardrobe?

30:39.590 --> 30:43.223
I need a uniform. The press
used to seeing her so.

30:45.814 --> 30:48.497
You did everything? - of course?

30:53.211 --> 30:56.458
I wanted to know Ludal as
woman understands a woman.

30:56.791 --> 31:00.046
How can coolly to
kill 309 people?

31:00.846 --> 31:04.930
Why is holding the gun?
This is not women's work.

31:05.714 --> 31:09.540
Our journalists have
called it Lady Death.

31:09.978 --> 31:12.914
I noticed how hurt her.

31:13.088 --> 31:17.530
She was smart and well educated.
She was a beauty!

31:18.206 --> 31:22.337
Just war came to her
home, she had no choice.

31:22.510 --> 31:28.644
Moreover, she had real talent to
become invisible and pinpoints.

31:30.671 --> 31:32.871
Training ground,
the summer of 1941

31:32.996 --> 31:37.323
First task of sniper: Unbeknownst
to get out of position.

31:37.455 --> 31:40.449
For this purpose, it is necessary
properly to crawl on his belly.

31:40.574 --> 31:42.657
<i> ass below! </i> - Lower!

31:42.783 --> 31:45.470
Left foot, rifle, right foot.

31:45.644 --> 31:51.646
Sliding, sliding, do not climb!
- Do it for time!

31:52.213 --> 31:56.787
Killed her! Hoity ass. Excellent
target for the enemy.

32:06.119 --> 32:08.202
Petty!

32:17.354 --> 32:20.648
And how you're going
to fight using that ?!

32:22.719 --> 32:24.802
What are you smiling?

32:28.001 --> 32:30.847
I see that one here does not
conceive that the Germans

32:30.973 --> 32:35.938
They took Zhitomir, Riga and
to Kiev, and Leningrad!

32:38.454 --> 32:42.897
We believed that the war would be
slight and will bring quick victory.

32:43.070 --> 32:46.529
But we retreat.
You see, retreat!

32:46.959 --> 32:48.979
And suffer huge losses!

32:49.152 --> 32:51.960
Tomorrow these losses will you!

32:52.184 --> 32:54.267

33:28.369 --> 33:30.452
Faster.

33:33.400 --> 33:35.791
Go!

33:40.398 --> 33:44.268
Dig deeper!
- Pull up the ass and slipped it!

33:45.068 --> 33:47.887
Come quickly, get together!

34:03.648 --> 34:05.731
Heel!

34:06.525 --> 34:08.608
Report changes!

34:10.708 --> 34:13.665
A stone disappeared.
- The cross also.

34:13.839 --> 34:16.735
Haystack is moved left.
With five meters.

34:16.860 --> 34:19.262
Lump is the site of the stump.

34:19.435 --> 34:23.848
Is this it? - The stone was moved
to The left. with The meter.

34:24.286 --> 34:26.739
Not bad ... Heel!

34:43.650 --> 34:46.551
Incorrect! Let's see then.

34:47.266 --> 34:49.360
This is the correct position.

35:01.704 --> 35:03.787
Killed her.

35:04.850 --> 35:07.475
Interestingly decision
but ineffective.

35:09.011 --> 35:13.408
<i> Good camouflage guarantee the
survival of the sniper. </i>

35:16.705 --> 35:19.943
Killed her. The flowers
are not of this meadow.

35:35.545 --> 35:37.966
Comrade Major, are killed.

35:38.805 --> 35:41.579
When are we going to shoot?

36:28.974 --> 36:31.132

36:31.362 --> 36:34.700
Still you want of shooting?
- Aye!

36:35.443 --> 36:37.526

36:54.435 --> 36:57.216
Comrade Major, depart. - Shoot.

Take men girls do not give them.

37:46.886 --> 37:49.606
They have a lot to learn.

37:49.964 --> 37:53.276
They not fired yet, just
brought us bullets.

37:53.450 --> 37:55.753
All have passed a
course on shooting.

37:56.710 --> 37:59.293
Half a year are shot there.

38:04.013 --> 38:07.391
Pity me. - And I'm sorry for my.

38:09.691 --> 38:12.195
They were less than half.

38:12.639 --> 38:14.722

Questions?

38:49.769 --> 38:52.408
And the tanks, Comrade Captain?

38:56.357 --> 38:59.291
The tank can be
stopped in two ways.

38:59.911 --> 39:03.716
First - with grenades
from short range.

39:05.371 --> 39:07.479

Hit twice in the same place.
The glass will crack.

39:15.812 --> 39:18.351
By the third shot
kill mechanic driver.

39:18.477 --> 39:20.560
Clear.

39:23.975 --> 39:26.993
Comrade Captain, then give flak.

39:40.888 --> 39:42.971

main burden of the war.

48:09.931 --> 48:12.742
But fascist aggression

Confidence begins with a smile.

49:16.417 --> 49:18.935
Softer and more natural.

49:19.916 --> 49:23.506
Remember now smile is
your primary weapon.

49:23.735 --> 49:27.393
It is hard. It's
hard to talk so.

49:27.567 --> 49:31.451
Of course it is difficult.

01:11:27.873 --> 01:11:29.956
Welcome, General.

01:11:30.902 --> 01:11:35.943
The first line of defense now
passes 13 km from Sevastopol.

01:11:36.867 --> 01:11:39.895
Thus the city is vulnerable
for the German artillery.

01:11:40.125 --> 01:11:43.302
We can not repel enemy further.

01:11:43.475 --> 01:11:46.871
But we could, defense
line will stretch

01:11:46.997 --> 01:11:50.601
and we will not be able to hold.
How to protect your city?

01:11:51.772 --> 01:11:55.881

01:12:06.436 --> 01:12:09.658
Their fire can overwhelm
the enemy artillery.

01:12:10.624 --> 01:12:16.088

My task is to protect the fleet. But
in this situation I have no right ...

Our common task is to
protect Sevastopol!

01:12:28.405 --> 01:12:32.932
The war moved on land. Your
inability or unwillingness

01:12:33.371 --> 01:12:36.026

death of seafarers.

01:12:38.641 --> 01:12:42.507

Not so. We are not any Fascists?

01:22:44.947 --> 01:22:48.953
Why did not let me kill him?
They do not deserve easy death.

They killed ... - not them work.
Wu is you.

01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:55.947
It should not live

War is not only death, she still ...
such a life.

01:23:02.061 --> 01:23:04.869
If you do not figure
out why live on war

You two. Here are
your two points.

01:23:30.065 --> 01:23:32.391

No. Otherwise I would have had I
regret that I was in love with her.

01:29:29.655 --> 01:29:32.538

But we thought that if
we are together ...

01:37:33.490 --> 01:37:35.573
not scary.

01:37:38.389 --> 01:37:40.472

01:37:40.696 --> 01:37:43.827

01:39:24.019 --> 01:39:26.285
Let them see that I'm a woman.

01:39:29.774 --> 01:39:32.936
You're not a woman.
You're a Soviet soldier.

01:39:34.614 --> 01:39:36.697
Remember this.

01:39:37.206 --> 01:39:41.831
Release: Stalin common

01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:38.792
I can not any more.

01:40:40.268 --> 01:40:43.792
Men were required

01:40:53.620 --> 01:40:56.167
<i> Sevastopol, summer 1942 ?. </i>

01:40:57.665 --> 01:40:59.819
Ludal.

01:41:07.051 --> 01:41:09.134

So I am guilty before you.
The war is over for you.

01:43:35.194 --> 01:43:38.195
Debilitating, unfit
for military service.

01:43:38.602 --> 01:43:41.267
Whom to invite disability?

01:43:41.837 --> 01:43:44.208
Pavlichenko is no
longer just a fighter.

01:43:44.664 --> 01:43:47.762
It is a symbol, and
symbols are not disabled.

01:43:47.935 --> 01:43:51.774
Immediately leave the hospital!
- Military Tribunal What you want?

01:43:53.592 --> 01:43:56.663
This is not a sanatorium
for prewar girlfriends.

01:43:57.201 --> 01:44:00.753
Do not you read? The
Germans said they killed.

01:44:01.246 --> 01:44:05.852
Third storm approaching, my soldiers enter

Give hand. - Leave me.

01:44:20.606 --> 01:44:22.752
Can higher?

01:44:27.847 --> 01:44:30.138
It does not seem very heroic.

01:44:32.935 --> 01:44:35.035
Smile.

01:44:35.369 --> 01:44:37.452
Above the head.

01:44:38.438 --> 01:44:40.521
More the merrier.

most terrible pages

01:54:38.282 --> 01:54:40.365
this great war.

01:54:41.108 --> 01:54:44.561
Defense of Sevastopol
lasts 250 days,

01:54:45.356 --> 01:54:47.868
but the city still He was
captured by the enemy.

01:54:48.996 --> 01:54:53.006

January rescues man who so He
fails to make its proposal.

01:55:39.015 --> 01:55:43.203
He gives her his pass muster.
This is a gap to life ...

01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:08.177
Lyudmila loved Boris,
her friend Masha

01:56:08.615 --> 01:56:13.063
and about 80 000 inhabitants and
defenders Sevastopol remain ashore.

01:56:13.188 --> 01:56:16.320
Themselves against the enemy.

01:56:19.535 --> 01:56:22.189
They are doomed to
death or captivity.

01:56:24.342 --> 01:56:28.434
Ludal often told me,
they are all heroes.

01:57:12.811 --> 01:57:17.432
Lord, I'm 25 years old.

01:57:22.410 --> 01:57:27.494

return to the front.

01:58:06.971 --> 01:58:10.129
