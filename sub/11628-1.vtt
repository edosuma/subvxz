No way I agreed to that!

09:38.459 --> 09:41.083
I couldn't have said yes. No way!

09:41.584 --> 09:42.916
I was meeting mom.

09:43.709 --> 09:44.916
Sure.
Your mom hates me.

09:45.250 --> 09:46.791
Don't slam the door, please.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.041
Hate? No.
She thinks you're immature.

09:49.209 --> 09:50.583
I'm not immature.

09:50.750 --> 09:51.541
You're not?

09:51.709 --> 09:53.083
Go easy on the door.

09:53.250 --> 09:55.666
It's a heap of stinking metal!

10:07.709 --> 10:09.166
- He doesn't know?
- No.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.166
Am I immature?

10:13.709 --> 10:14.499
Immature?

10:17.084 --> 10:18.124
Cut it out.

10:19.500 --> 10:20.874
What's the problem?

10:21.334 --> 10:23.249
Lisa wants us to live together.

10:23.417 --> 10:23.999
What?

10:24.625 --> 10:26.999
After only 5 years together?

10:29.584 --> 10:30.499
I know.

10:30.667 --> 10:32.041
The time's flown by.

10:33.084 --> 10:34.624
I'll have to sell the car.

10:35.042 --> 10:37.666
Then we'll get a Labrador.

10:38.125 --> 10:40.041
Then decorate a bedroom...

10:42.250 --> 10:44.208

14:16.334 --> 14:17.458
Sorry?

14:18.209 --> 14:19.416
What?

14:20.709 --> 14:22.166
- What's up?
- No idea.

14:26.792 --> 14:28.124

tell us more?

15:01.834 --> 15:03.458
Zaief is a fanatic.

15:03.584 --> 15:04.916
Totally unpredictable.

15:05.375 --> 15:07.666
I want her back alive.

15:08.084 --> 15:08.999
Is that clear?

15:09.167 --> 15:12.208
Do we have any idea where they are?

15:12.375 --> 15:14.166
In his tribal stronghold,

15:14.542 --> 15:16.666
Zaief thinks he's untouchable.

15:17.500 --> 15:20.499
We can send in
a special forces unit.

15:20.625 --> 15:22.499
- How many men?
- Around sixty.

15:22.667 --> 15:23.333

17:44.334 --> 17:45.708
one line on the right.

17:45.875 --> 17:48.124
If you step out of line,

17:48.292 --> 17:50.541
I set you straight. My way.

17:53.667 --> 17:57.749
You're all gonna learn
to spit thunder out front

17:58.125 --> 17:59.833
and fart lightning out behind.

18:11.834 --> 18:13.541

18:31.542 --> 18:33.999
Victor, put your pop gun away.

18:34.417 --> 18:36.249
The boss is here. He's waiting.

18:37.042 --> 18:39.083
What's with the t-shirt?

18:39.250 --> 18:41.583
- I got you one. Kiddie size.
- You did?

18:43.459 --> 18:44.583

18:44.750 --> 18:46.708
You're my little canary!

20:32.584 --> 20:33.833

20:34.375 --> 20:35.041
Commander!

20:35.209 --> 20:35.791
Gentlemen.

20:38.750 --> 20:40.333
Yes, we have a new sniper.

20:41.125 --> 20:42.708
New and never been fucked.

20:43.250 --> 20:44.208
Distance record?

20:44.375 --> 20:46.416
I killed a rabbit at 253 meters.

20:46.625 --> 20:47.458

20:52.834 --> 20:54.333
Rabbit's on the menu.

20:55.334 --> 20:56.166
The bad news...

20:57.500 --> 20:59.291
The hostages are in Pakistan.

20:59.459 --> 21:00.583
In the tribal areas.

21:00.750 --> 21:01.749
Happy birthday!

21:02.292 --> 21:04.833
The good news is
it's only reconnaissance.

21:05.042 --> 21:07.791
For once, we're in the front row,
not on stage.

21:08.375 --> 21:09.416
Questions?

21:09.542 --> 21:10.708
For your information,

21:10.875 --> 21:13.291
Casanova opposes our presence here.

21:13.459 --> 21:14.749
Any other questions?

21:14.917 --> 21:16.083
Yeah.

21:16.834 --> 21:17.916
Is she pretty?

24:34.917 --> 24:36.458
Bring in Salemani.

Permission granted, admiral.

26:02.209 --> 26:04.124

26:05.125 --> 26:07.541
When they take off,
I gotta talk to Kovax.

26:11.042 --> 26:14.124
12 hours later

26:14.584 --> 26:16.291
- Enough, turn it off.
- He's sick.

26:17.209 --> 26:20.374
No French woman will be decapitated
for the world to see.

26:21.125 --> 26:23.374
How long before your men
can intervene?

26:23.500 --> 26:24.374
24 hours.

26:24.500 --> 26:26.249
In that case, we've lost.

26:26.584 --> 26:27.291
Perhaps not.

26:27.459 --> 26:29.499
We have an ace up our sleeves.

26:42.875 --> 26:44.249
That's the situation.

26:47.417 --> 26:49.291
Slight change of plans.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.333
The chances of success?

26:58.500 --> 27:01.458
There are no guarantees
with ops like this.

27:01.584 --> 27:03.124
That's why they're special.

27:06.417 --> 27:08.041
Permission to proceed.

27:20.625 --> 27:21.791
Double ammo time.

27:24.500 --> 27:25.416
What's that?

27:30.250 --> 27:31.624
We'll give it a shot.

27:42.209 --> 27:43.916

By the almighty Prophet, welcome.

31:23.500 --> 31:25.458
Greetings, men of the Shura.

31:31.500 --> 31:32.624
He didn't kill her.

31:38.709 --> 31:41.499
Many of our brothers think
you can't be trusted.

31:42.750 --> 31:44.374
On what grounds?

31:44.750 --> 31:46.874
They say you work for your own glory

31:47.084 --> 31:49.249
rather than to achieve God's will.

31:51.417 --> 31:53.583
I'm the Shura's loyal servant.

31:54.459 --> 31:56.624
She's like those impure sluts

31:57.292 --> 31:59.624
he frequented in London.

32:02.417 --> 32:03.624
Women are the weak point

32:04.292 --> 32:05.666
of the West.

32:07.750 --> 32:09.999
Don't be taken in again.

32:15.417 --> 32:16.999
If this woman is to die,

32:17.709 --> 32:20.124
it's a sign she must go
to meet Allah.

32:23.209 --> 32:25.291
Don't disappoint me.

32:53.292 --> 32:55.208
Is it me
or are they multiplying?

32:55.542 --> 32:57.083
There's not enough of us.

32:57.250 --> 32:59.541
Shut it, Tic Tac.
Tell us where they are.

33:07.042 --> 33:09.333

33:09.625 --> 33:11.374
That's their holiday home.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.541
Movement, 3 o'clock.

33:18.334 --> 33:19.499
What are they doing?

33:21.459 --> 33:22.833
Stay put.

33:24.167 --> 33:25.166
We just watch?

33:26.209 --> 33:27.208
Yes.

33:28.084 --> 33:29.083
Why?

33:30.084 --> 33:31.583
That's not why we're here.

33:35.667 --> 33:37.083
Not why we're here.

34:27.667 --> 34:28.416
Showtime!

35:27.000 --> 35:27.583
Elias,

35:27.875 --> 35:28.874
you with us?

35:29.084 --> 35:29.749
Right here.

35:30.792 --> 35:32.124
On 3.

35:33.084 --> 35:33.999
1...

35:35.542 --> 35:36.541

35:37.334 --> 35:38.134

36:11.750 --> 36:12.833
Clear!

36:44.709 --> 36:45.833
French army!

36:47.167 --> 36:47.708
Keep calm!

36:50.042 --> 36:50.624
Hi!

36:51.334 --> 36:52.708
Elsa Casanova?

36:53.750 --> 36:54.499
Amin Takharoud?

36:56.417 --> 36:57.291
Turn around!

37:05.292 --> 37:06.499
- Got that?
- Yes.

37:16.792 --> 37:18.374
- They know we're here.
- Out!

37:20.375 --> 37:21.333
Head down.

38:01.500 --> 38:02.541
I'm unhurt!

38:03.084 --> 38:04.416
Get over here!

38:09.500 --> 38:11.624
They're coming in from all sides.

38:25.459 --> 38:26.791
Contact rear!

38:36.625 --> 38:37.624
Go!

38:50.209 --> 38:52.333
Elias, fall back.

38:56.584 --> 38:58.416
If you can hear me, fall back.

38:58.542 --> 38:59.499
I'll hold them off

38:59.667 --> 39:00.708
and catch you up.

39:38.417 --> 39:39.749
What's going on here?

39:44.834 --> 39:45.874
Sir!

39:46.084 --> 39:50.291
Commandos came to rescue them!

40:27.625 --> 40:28.791
We lost 2 radio bags.

40:29.209 --> 40:30.708
This one's dead.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.499
The choppers'll be there.

40:36.084 --> 40:36.833
Show me your arm.

40:37.209 --> 40:38.208
Look after her.

40:43.125 --> 40:44.916
Rest assured, it'll be fine.

40:45.375 --> 40:46.916
You follow me.

40:47.125 --> 40:49.374
It's easier if you hold my pack.

40:50.667 --> 40:52.666
Come on, take my hand.

40:56.084 --> 40:57.124
Let's go.

41:04.625 --> 41:06.499
Any tighter, I'll punch you.

41:34.750 --> 41:36.249
Swarming with sharks.

41:36.417 --> 41:37.124
GPS?

41:37.459 --> 41:39.458
36 north 72 east.

41:41.334 --> 41:43.166
We can dodge them that way.

41:43.667 --> 41:45.666
But we won't make the pick-up.

41:45.834 --> 41:47.166
The distress signal?

41:47.334 --> 41:48.749
The Taliban might locate it.

41:48.917 --> 41:50.291
They already located us.

41:50.584 --> 41:51.791
You and Marius go ahead.

41:54.042 --> 41:56.499
- Where are we going?
- Later. We gotta move.

42:01.667 --> 42:03.208
Look who it is...

42:08.167 --> 42:09.749
He's made some new friends.

42:31.584 --> 42:32.916
It's the whole Mexican army!

42:33.125 --> 42:33.874
C'mon, buddy.

42:41.750 --> 42:43.791
- What's he doing?
- Winding them up.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.291
They're playful.

42:59.375 --> 43:01.624
Wait...

43:03.500 --> 43:04.166
Now!

43:19.792 --> 43:21.541
I don't know why...

43:22.084 --> 43:24.624
I hesitate more and more
about pushing a button.

43:25.625 --> 43:28.791
It's getting obsessive.
I'll mention it to my shrink.

43:29.084 --> 43:30.541
Shut up and press, captain.

43:31.000 --> 43:31.833
Yes, Marius.

43:32.042 --> 43:33.291
Can I help?

43:39.250 --> 43:40.749
I'll change the dressing.

43:41.750 --> 43:42.874
It needs closing up.

43:43.584 --> 43:44.416
Sure.

43:44.542 --> 43:45.541
Of course.

43:45.875 --> 43:48.041
We're 22 km from the pick-up.

43:48.209 --> 43:49.624
On top of the world's asshole.

43:49.792 --> 43:51.499
There are ladies present.

43:51.750 --> 43:53.708
Sorry, it must be the emotion.

43:56.417 --> 43:58.833
By the way,
I'm not very good at sewing.

44:02.709 --> 44:03.749
Ready?

44:08.334 --> 44:09.083
Okay?

44:10.084 --> 44:10.749
Fine.

44:20.167 --> 44:21.416
A distress signal.

44:21.542 --> 44:23.124
20 km from the pick-up.

44:24.417 --> 44:25.249
Moving?

44:25.417 --> 44:26.417
Negative.

44:29.792 --> 44:31.124
We're 30 minutes ahead.

44:32.250 --> 44:35.166
- The choppers?
- They'll go to the pick-up first.

44:35.334 --> 44:36.249
You okay?

44:36.417 --> 44:38.333
We haven't eaten for 3 days.

44:38.500 --> 44:40.458
Tell her to take her time.

44:42.875 --> 44:44.874
Lucas took your article to heart.

44:45.125 --> 44:47.166
The military doesn't like criticism.

44:50.250 --> 44:51.416
They patch you up?

44:51.542 --> 44:52.291
She did.

44:52.625 --> 44:54.666
- Really?
- Wipe that smile off.

44:54.834 --> 44:57.041
- Your analysis was interesting.
- Thanks.

44:58.167 --> 44:59.791
I didn't say I agreed.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.708
Good or bad,
politics isn't our concern.

45:31.209 --> 45:32.458
Lively down there.

45:32.584 --> 45:33.791
What's going on?

45:34.209 --> 45:35.499
Our taxis catching shit.

45:39.667 --> 45:41.499
Gaining. 10 minutes behind.

45:42.084 --> 45:42.999
Shit.

45:44.750 --> 45:45.833
Pick-up's screwed.

45:58.709 --> 46:00.124
They failed.

46:01.125 --> 46:02.916
Nobody at the pick-up zone.

46:03.125 --> 46:06.749
A chopper crash-landed,
with one man seriously wounded.

46:06.917 --> 46:08.166
The hostages?

46:08.334 --> 46:10.916
No news of the commandos
for 3 hours.

47:11.667 --> 47:13.708
DAY 2

47:29.334 --> 47:31.583
Let's rest up,
she can't take any more.

47:34.250 --> 47:35.458
Break time.

48:00.709 --> 48:02.333
You have a Plan B?

48:02.709 --> 48:04.041
No, there's no Plan B.

48:08.917 --> 48:10.416
What's he plan on doing?

48:10.584 --> 48:11.791
I don't know.

48:12.584 --> 48:14.624
Looking at him, we won't like it.

48:14.792 --> 48:16.166
Here, captain.

48:17.667 --> 48:18.499
Victor.

48:28.625 --> 48:30.166
Well? What's the plan?

48:31.125 --> 48:33.708
For Afghanistan,
we have one entry.

48:33.875 --> 48:34.999
And it's right there.

48:40.417 --> 48:41.749
You're completely nuts.

48:45.209 --> 48:47.416
We're here to get you back
and we will.

48:49.750 --> 48:51.374
Anybody got a better idea?

48:55.209 --> 48:58.499
One hour of glory
beats an eternity of anonymity.

49:16.375 --> 49:19.124
Their chances get slimmer
by the hour.

49:19.292 --> 49:22.124
Until proven otherwise,
we keep looking.

49:22.500 --> 49:24.291
I want everybody to stay alert.

49:43.042 --> 49:44.874
How did you wind up here?

49:45.834 --> 49:47.083
By parachute.

49:48.334 --> 49:49.499
You know what I mean.

49:50.084 --> 49:51.374
At last!

49:51.500 --> 49:54.666
I wondered
when the journalist would resurface.

49:55.750 --> 49:57.249
What do you want to know?

49:57.584 --> 50:00.499
How I wound up
with these boneheads in uniform?

50:00.750 --> 50:03.041
No, I didn't mean that.

50:03.459 --> 50:05.749
Sure.
We're not all Nobel prizewinners.

50:06.584 --> 50:07.874
But you guys neither.

50:09.000 --> 50:10.499
Are you married?

50:11.292 --> 50:12.416
Not right now.

50:16.500 --> 50:17.791
Biscuits with your tea?

50:22.000 --> 50:23.666
- What?
- We'll never make it.

50:23.834 --> 50:25.499
You'd rather sit and wait?

50:26.709 --> 50:28.499
I hope you've called this right.

50:29.917 --> 50:31.166
Me too.

50:31.667 --> 50:32.791
You were very brave.

50:33.709 --> 50:34.791
That's not bravery.

50:37.375 --> 50:39.541
Bravery
is that woman in the village.

50:40.500 --> 50:42.999
Before her execution,
she raised her burqa.

50:43.459 --> 50:44.833
Know what she did then?

50:46.334 --> 50:47.708
She smiled at them.

50:48.917 --> 50:50.458
And what did I do?

50:52.292 --> 50:53.499
Nothing at all.

50:57.417 --> 50:59.999
Sorry,
I'm not much good at chatting.

51:02.250 --> 51:03.374
You okay?

51:03.834 --> 51:04.624
Sure.

51:33.542 --> 51:36.374
DAY 3

51:39.459 --> 51:40.166
Tic Tac.

51:43.334 --> 51:44.541
I'm on it.

52:01.875 --> 52:03.124
Is he trustworthy?

52:03.709 --> 52:04.499
What?

52:04.625 --> 52:06.333
Is he trustworthy, yes or no?

52:10.125 --> 52:12.833
The Taliban massacred his family.
Good enough?

52:30.625 --> 52:31.791
Thanks.

52:34.667 --> 52:36.666
I believe breakfast is served.

52:50.334 --> 52:52.874
- They won't drop it.
- They like you too much.

52:58.584 --> 53:01.458
Elsa, why won't he let it go?

53:02.125 --> 53:03.833
It became personal.

53:04.375 --> 53:06.124
Sorry, I don't understand.

53:06.292 --> 53:07.874
They're getting bigger here.

53:11.917 --> 53:14.916
He can't lose face.
He'll do anything to get me.

53:15.125 --> 53:17.083
It gets better and better.

53:19.167 --> 53:20.499
Pay no attention.

53:22.834 --> 53:23.916
Go on.

53:30.750 --> 53:33.333
Straight up,
3 days running from these jerks...

53:34.709 --> 53:36.708
Yeah, aren't you sick of it?

54:32.542 --> 54:33.999
Contact front!

56:06.334 --> 56:06.916
Reload!

56:07.125 --> 56:08.041
Lead!

56:39.750 --> 56:41.499
Turn around! Go back!

56:42.500 --> 56:43.416
Turn around!

56:43.750 --> 56:44.916
They're devils!

56:46.500 --> 56:47.791
Go back up there!

56:48.000 --> 56:48.749
Why?

56:48.917 --> 56:49.749
The Hindu Kush

56:49.917 --> 56:52.083
will vanquish the woman.

56:57.375 --> 56:58.916
Go back and kill her!

57:00.584 --> 57:01.291
Oakley!

57:04.584 --> 57:05.624
Western women

57:07.417 --> 57:09.499
are stronger than you think.

57:10.584 --> 57:11.791
Go on! Catch them!

57:14.750 --> 57:15.916
Go back!

57:40.584 --> 57:43.416
DAY 4

57:50.459 --> 57:51.791
They're massacring us.

57:52.625 --> 57:54.541
"The reasons behind a fiasco."

57:54.709 --> 57:56.583
"Defense indefensible."

57:59.375 --> 58:01.749
If we did nothing,
it'd be the same.

58:03.542 --> 58:07.166
Six guys are out there,
trying to bring her home.

58:24.459 --> 58:26.041
Friend or enemy?

58:27.542 --> 58:29.249
The next peak's 5,000 meters.

58:29.417 --> 58:31.916
We won't make it
without food and clothing.

58:36.500 --> 58:38.583
What the hell are they doing?

59:12.292 --> 59:13.916
Next time, I tie you up.

59:45.000 --> 59:46.791
Indoctrination in the madrassas.

59:47.667 --> 59:49.083
The children come home

59:49.459 --> 59:51.041
to impose sharia law.

59:53.250 --> 59:54.749
No wonder they dislike them.

01:00:02.625 --> 01:00:04.999
- What do you think?
- Yeah, that one.

01:00:05.375 --> 01:00:06.333
It's a deal.

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:07.916
This one, too.

01:00:08.292 --> 01:00:10.624
- We'll take them all.
- They're great.

01:00:25.125 --> 01:00:27.124
- Come and get it!
- Give me that!

01:00:41.125 --> 01:00:43.124
There you go, friend.
Suits you better.

01:00:46.792 --> 01:00:48.041
Get down!

01:00:48.209 --> 01:00:49.291
Hide!

01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:50.583
Take cover!

01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:51.833
Get up!

01:00:52.792 --> 01:00:55.416
He's dead! Victor, move it!

01:00:56.125 --> 01:00:57.708
Let go!

01:00:57.875 --> 01:00:59.083
He's dead!

01:03:11.667 --> 01:03:15.083
DAY 5

01:04:16.292 --> 01:04:17.499
I'm going with him.

01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:21.999
We can't just let them go.

01:04:22.167 --> 01:04:23.999
No martyrs! It's pointless.

01:04:24.167 --> 01:04:26.249
Their hospitality's gonna
get them killed.

01:04:26.667 --> 01:04:27.499
So what?

01:04:27.625 --> 01:04:30.374
We've already lost Marius
because of a dumbass journalist.

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:32.416
We're not dying for some hicks.

01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:38.041
The dumbass journalist
would rather stay with the hicks.

01:04:38.209 --> 01:04:39.541
Negative!

01:04:40.459 --> 01:04:42.458
Lucas, stay with your new friend.

01:04:43.625 --> 01:04:45.166
We're going humanitarian.

01:05:17.209 --> 01:05:21.083
We're delighted
to have you in our village.

01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:24.916
Everybody wishes you a warm welcome.

01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:36.499
Where is she?

01:05:52.834 --> 01:05:53.999
Find her!

01:06:13.375 --> 01:06:14.874
I'm sorry.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.666
I didn't mean what I said.

01:06:59.042 --> 01:07:00.541
You never know.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:13.999
He loved this gun.

01:07:19.667 --> 01:07:20.499
For Marius.

01:08:41.167 --> 01:08:43.416
Can't you hear the gunfire?

01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:45.249
Find them!

01:09:35.125 --> 01:09:37.541
- I ever say I love this job?
- No, never.

01:11:43.417 --> 01:11:44.374
Victor!

01:11:45.625 --> 01:11:46.499
Fuck!

01:11:48.334 --> 01:11:49.708
Victor's down! Fall back!

01:11:49.875 --> 01:11:50.916
Grab hold!

01:12:23.167 --> 01:12:24.333
Reload!

01:12:42.125 --> 01:12:42.916
Amin's dead.

01:12:47.250 --> 01:12:48.083
Reload.

01:12:51.709 --> 01:12:53.291
Go, I'll cover you.

01:12:54.375 --> 01:12:55.874
I'll be okay.

01:12:59.375 --> 01:12:59.999
Go on!

01:13:09.042 --> 01:13:10.166
Shit!

01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:11.583
Take it easy!

01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:13.374
Put him down there.

01:13:17.459 --> 01:13:18.916
Can you do a tourniquet?

01:13:19.125 --> 01:13:20.041
It hurts!

01:13:20.250 --> 01:13:21.624
Put your hands there.

01:13:21.792 --> 01:13:23.041
Press down hard.

01:13:32.625 --> 01:13:33.374
Amin?

01:13:36.875 --> 01:13:37.916
Hang in there.

01:13:38.834 --> 01:13:39.874
Tough it out.

01:13:40.125 --> 01:13:41.916
- We wait for Elias?
- No.

01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:44.166
Why not?

01:14:30.417 --> 01:14:31.833
Let's take five!

01:14:38.667 --> 01:14:39.374
Leave me.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:42.916
Leave me here.

01:14:43.125 --> 01:14:45.041
Sure, when you stop breathing.

01:14:46.167 --> 01:14:47.874
Until then, hang in there.

01:14:48.917 --> 01:14:50.249
I will.

01:14:51.834 --> 01:14:53.583
We'll never make it.

01:14:54.792 --> 01:14:55.999
What's the altitude?

01:14:57.334 --> 01:14:58.916
3,800 - 3,900.

01:15:01.334 --> 01:15:02.749
It's starting to snow.

01:15:03.375 --> 01:15:04.791
The temperature's falling.

01:15:07.625 --> 01:15:08.499
It ain't good.

01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:15.791
We need a shelter.

01:15:22.042 --> 01:15:23.416
Victor, let's go.

01:15:23.709 --> 01:15:25.083
Elsa, take my blanket.

01:15:27.584 --> 01:15:29.624
C'mon, man! That's good.

01:15:33.375 --> 01:15:34.083
Good man!

01:15:55.334 --> 01:15:57.499
DAY 6

01:16:20.417 --> 01:16:21.791
He's having convulsions.

01:16:22.125 --> 01:16:22.874
Pin him down.

01:16:23.292 --> 01:16:24.166
Hold his legs.

01:16:24.334 --> 01:16:25.291
I've got him.

01:16:27.834 --> 01:16:29.124
- More morphine?
- No way.

01:16:30.292 --> 01:16:31.333
It'd kill him.

01:16:34.042 --> 01:16:34.916
He's suffocating.

01:16:35.584 --> 01:16:37.249
Get his jaw open.

01:16:44.625 --> 01:16:47.208
That's good, Victor. Come on!

01:16:55.084 --> 01:16:57.084
Deep breaths.

01:18:23.875 --> 01:18:26.458
You're as scared as me!

01:18:29.334 --> 01:18:31.291
And I don't even hate you!

01:19:28.084 --> 01:19:29.249
You okay?

01:19:30.625 --> 01:19:32.291
I was far away, huh?

01:19:32.875 --> 01:19:34.833
What matters is you're back.

01:19:36.875 --> 01:19:38.833
Tic Tac lost his wife 9 years ago.

01:19:40.250 --> 01:19:42.291
I'd like him to be happy.

01:19:45.625 --> 01:19:46.708
Rest.

01:21:07.334 --> 01:21:09.749
DAY 7

01:22:08.084 --> 01:22:09.124
What are you doing?

01:22:12.625 --> 01:22:16.374
How many dead before you see
you'll never be back for them?

01:22:17.334 --> 01:22:18.499
Who's next, you or me?

01:22:22.834 --> 01:22:23.999
What do you want?

01:22:24.167 --> 01:22:25.208
Stop!

01:22:27.042 --> 01:22:27.874
Stop it!

01:22:33.125 --> 01:22:34.749
You never listen!

01:22:35.417 --> 01:22:37.083
I'm staying here.

01:22:38.334 --> 01:22:40.083
Do you have children?

01:22:40.542 --> 01:22:41.458
No.

01:22:41.834 --> 01:22:44.708
We're taking you home
and you can have loads.

01:22:48.167 --> 01:22:48.916
Listen up.

01:22:49.459 --> 01:22:51.083
Lisa is pregnant.

01:22:51.250 --> 01:22:54.583
Do me a favor,
make it home and take care of her.

01:23:42.625 --> 01:23:44.458
I don't have kids either.

01:23:47.167 --> 01:23:49.333
Is that an offer, captain?

01:23:50.584 --> 01:23:53.874
I'm serious.
I'd really like to see you again.

01:24:03.167 --> 01:24:04.833
I'm gonna be a dad?

01:24:08.625 --> 01:24:09.874
Yes, buddy.

01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:40.624
DAY 8

01:25:02.459 --> 01:25:03.624
Shit!

01:25:05.834 --> 01:25:07.999
Why'd she suffer in silence?

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:09.999
Out of respect.

01:25:11.042 --> 01:25:12.458
She's got guts.

01:25:12.834 --> 01:25:15.124
Ballsy.
Wait for her to faint to be nice.

01:25:25.625 --> 01:25:26.791
Don't look.

01:25:30.209 --> 01:25:31.124
It's okay.

01:25:46.625 --> 01:25:48.666
You know Victor's last words?

01:25:49.209 --> 01:25:50.708
"I love this job."

01:26:05.500 --> 01:26:06.999
DAY 9

01:26:09.750 --> 01:26:12.999
How'd you become a reporter
in a war zone?

01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:16.249
By falling in love

01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:18.458
with countries like this.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.416
Choose Holland next time.

01:26:22.417 --> 01:26:23.458
Why Holland?

01:26:23.584 --> 01:26:24.874
It's flat.

01:26:27.875 --> 01:26:30.041
Honestly,
how did you wind up here?

01:26:31.167 --> 01:26:32.791
It was this or Holland.

01:26:33.459 --> 01:26:34.874
Holland's cool.

01:26:35.084 --> 01:26:36.666
Yeah, it's flat.

01:26:41.084 --> 01:26:41.708
That's good.

01:26:41.875 --> 01:26:44.374
Yeah, let's not talk about it.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:48.541
Next time, I'll take you
to an Italian restaurant.

01:26:49.042 --> 01:26:51.374
Neapolitan specialties.
Near my place.

01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:52.624
You'll love it.

01:26:52.792 --> 01:26:55.374
They make wonderful risottos.

01:26:55.500 --> 01:26:57.874
Risotto with porcini mushrooms.

01:26:58.875 --> 01:27:00.083
Maybe.

01:27:00.334 --> 01:27:01.666
In another life.

01:27:03.125 --> 01:27:05.249
It's not come to that yet.

01:27:05.417 --> 01:27:06.499
Don't worry.

01:27:06.750 --> 01:27:08.208
We'll make it.

01:28:32.417 --> 01:28:33.499
Contact!

01:28:33.667 --> 01:28:34.791
Take cover!

01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:22.208
Lucas!

01:30:47.625 --> 01:30:49.666
Are you okay?

01:30:57.375 --> 01:30:58.499
Shit!

01:31:02.167 --> 01:31:03.458
It'll be okay.

01:31:05.167 --> 01:31:06.291
You'll make it.

01:31:11.334 --> 01:31:13.499
It went too fast.

01:31:33.042 --> 01:31:34.124
You'll be okay!

01:33:40.834 --> 01:33:43.083
DAY 10

01:34:08.125 --> 01:34:10.249
Shit, we've gone 3 km in 2 hours.

01:34:12.292 --> 01:34:14.333
See the mountain we just crossed?

01:34:16.417 --> 01:34:18.124
That's the border.

01:34:38.417 --> 01:34:39.208
Move!

01:34:59.334 --> 01:35:00.166
Pull!

01:35:11.542 --> 01:35:12.342
Jesus!

01:35:20.334 --> 01:35:21.374
I'll be okay.

01:35:47.500 --> 01:35:48.874
Finish up without us.

01:36:05.375 --> 01:36:06.499
Take it.

01:36:09.459 --> 01:36:11.291
I'm not leaving you here.

01:36:11.792 --> 01:36:13.083
Look at us.

01:36:15.542 --> 01:36:17.166
We can't go any farther.

01:36:20.209 --> 01:36:21.458
Please.

01:36:22.292 --> 01:36:23.499
Take it.

01:36:37.584 --> 01:36:39.124
Take this compass, too.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:44.208
Take the compass.

01:36:46.334 --> 01:36:48.416
Keep heading west.

01:36:49.584 --> 01:36:51.624
West. Head west.

01:36:52.709 --> 01:36:54.416
I can't leave you here.

01:36:55.542 --> 01:36:56.333
You can

01:36:57.250 --> 01:36:58.208
and you will.

01:36:58.792 --> 01:37:00.499
I'm sorry, I can't.

01:37:00.625 --> 01:37:03.249
If not for yourself,
do it for the others.

01:37:07.917 --> 01:37:10.499
You have to make it
or all this means nothing.

01:37:11.709 --> 01:37:13.041
Go home.

01:37:21.459 --> 01:37:23.059
Go on.

01:38:24.250 --> 01:38:25.333
Go.

01:39:00.875 --> 01:39:02.624
She's hot for me.

01:39:03.334 --> 01:39:04.499
Sizzling.

01:39:08.750 --> 01:39:10.166
I love the girl.

01:39:12.167 --> 01:39:13.291
She'll make it.

01:39:54.500 --> 01:39:55.749
I'm going home.

01:40:02.500 --> 01:40:03.916
Anyway, you're all dead!

01:40:14.709 --> 01:40:18.041
DAY 11

01:41:30.500 --> 01:41:33.124
DAY 12

01:41:35.250 --> 01:41:36.624
- Admiral!
- Yes?

01:41:38.750 --> 01:41:40.124
She's alive.

01:41:47.250 --> 01:41:49.916
- You'll be in Paris tomorrow.
- I won't leave Kabul.

01:41:50.292 --> 01:41:51.666
Be reasonable.
You need treatment.

01:41:52.042 --> 01:41:54.083
I'm staying till you get them.

01:41:54.250 --> 01:41:57.083
These people are here
to look after you.

01:42:01.125 --> 01:42:01.874
Sorry.

01:42:02.084 --> 01:42:03.083
Please...

01:42:03.417 --> 01:42:04.624
Excuse me.

01:42:14.167 --> 01:42:15.499
- Climb up?
- Yes.

01:42:15.834 --> 01:42:16.624
What's going on?

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.166
A quick flight and we'll be back.

01:42:23.125 --> 01:42:24.208
Admiral!

01:42:24.375 --> 01:42:26.208
Yes, I know, Minister.

01:42:30.667 --> 01:42:31.749
Thank you.

01:42:32.459 --> 01:42:34.374
For what? I should've found you.

01:45:07.334 --> 01:45:11.999
For Jonathan and all French soldiers
fallen in Afghanistan.

01:45:12.167 --> 01:45:14.124
And for all war reporters

01:45:14.292 --> 01:45:18.166
who take risks covering the news
all over the globe.
