♪ One night in Bangkok
makes a hard man humble... ♪

00:16.135 --> 00:19.704
I have been buzzing you with
the call button for half an hour!

00:19.739 --> 00:21.973
Something's wrong with my husband.

00:22.007 --> 00:23.808
Um, I'm sorry, but it's Halloween.

00:23.843 --> 00:25.877
We all kind of like
letting loose on Halloween.

00:25.911 --> 00:27.312
I think he's dying!

00:31.851 --> 00:33.518
(music playing in distance)

00:33.552 --> 00:35.286
(woman laughing)

00:35.321 --> 00:37.489
Have you seen Dr. Mike?
Someone is having an emergency

00:37.523 --> 00:39.391
that just can't wait
till the party is over.

00:39.425 --> 00:41.993
My husband has C.O.P.D.
He can't breathe.

00:42.027 --> 00:43.395
Are you sure he's not just dressed up

00:43.429 --> 00:45.864
- as a dude with C.O.P.D.?
- Uh, pretty sure Dr. Mike

00:45.898 --> 00:47.565
is in the back rack looking
for quaaludes. (chuckles)

00:48.901 --> 00:50.668
NURSE: Dr. Mike?

00:52.605 --> 00:53.738
Hello, ladies.

00:53.773 --> 00:55.340
My husband needs a doctor!

00:55.374 --> 00:56.908
(chuckles): But it's Halloween.

00:56.942 --> 00:58.576
- That's what I told her.
- Please,

00:58.611 --> 00:59.577
I'm begging you.

00:59.612 --> 01:01.713
All right.

01:01.747 --> 01:05.583
If I have to save a
life tonight, so be it.

01:05.618 --> 01:08.086
It is what I do.

01:08.120 --> 01:10.321
DR. MIKE: Deep breath.

01:10.356 --> 01:11.890
Yeah, again.

01:11.924 --> 01:13.925
(crunching) -
Uh-huh. Again.

01:15.761 --> 01:17.729
Okay. (clears throat)

01:17.763 --> 01:19.164
His lungs need to be drained.

01:19.198 --> 01:20.899
I say we wait until morning.

01:20.933 --> 01:22.500
Give him the procedure now!

01:22.535 --> 01:24.169
Or I swear, I'll make sure

01:24.203 --> 01:26.037
all of you lose your medical licenses.

01:26.071 --> 01:28.206
I will shut this hospital down.

01:30.776 --> 01:33.878
Okay, you know what? Um...
you're absolutely right.

01:33.913 --> 01:37.782
It's like we forgot our
Hippocratic oath. Okay.

01:37.817 --> 01:40.084
Bill, uh, I am going
to give you a sedative,

01:40.119 --> 01:42.687
and then I am personally
going to take you to the O.R.

01:42.721 --> 01:45.390
Okay? Where I will be
performing your procedure, okay?

01:46.826 --> 01:48.026
Everything will be fine.

01:48.060 --> 01:49.861
Baby, I love you so much.

01:49.895 --> 01:53.431
You're my life, you're my everything.

01:53.466 --> 01:55.567
How's our son doing?

01:55.601 --> 01:57.202
Good. Good.

01:57.236 --> 01:58.903
(sniffles) Excited for you to come home.

01:58.938 --> 02:00.071
WOMAN (over intercom):
Nurse Lancer, please bring

02:00.105 --> 02:02.106
Hawaiian Punch to the Halloween party.

02:02.141 --> 02:04.976
DR. MIKE: Okay. Ma'am,
gonna have to ask you

02:05.010 --> 02:06.578
to go wait in the waiting room.

02:06.612 --> 02:07.612
Okay.

02:07.646 --> 02:10.215
Thank you so much, Doctor.

02:10.249 --> 02:12.784
Okay, Bill.

02:14.320 --> 02:15.854
Sleepy time.

02:17.590 --> 02:19.090
I owe you.

02:19.124 --> 02:20.959
It's what I do.

02:27.433 --> 02:29.968
(sighs) I cannot believe we're
missing the party for this.

02:31.470 --> 02:33.171
Screw that.

02:33.205 --> 02:35.139
This hospital was originally built

02:35.174 --> 02:37.008
as a tuberculosis
clinic, but the patients

02:37.042 --> 02:39.577
who were checking in just
kept getting sicker and sicker

02:39.612 --> 02:41.513
until they realized it
was because they built it

02:41.547 --> 02:43.615
up against this rancid swamp.

02:43.649 --> 02:45.917
So they closed it down for a
decade until they reopened it,

02:45.951 --> 02:48.520
and now we are the fourth
best performing hospital

02:48.554 --> 02:50.622
out of four in the area,
which is great for us

02:50.656 --> 02:52.957
because it keeps expectations super low.

02:54.460 --> 02:56.594
I never liked this swamp.

02:56.629 --> 02:58.830
I grew up around here and... (pants)

02:58.864 --> 03:00.298
the kids used to always talk

03:00.332 --> 03:03.935
about a... a monster
that lived back here.

03:03.969 --> 03:06.538
The Green Meanie.

03:06.572 --> 03:08.640
Swamp itself is the monster.

03:08.674 --> 03:10.642
You know if you leave a body out here,

03:10.676 --> 03:11.809
between the bugs and the bacteria,

03:11.844 --> 03:14.445
it will disappear in a matter of days?

03:14.480 --> 03:16.114
We're just gonna leave him here?

03:16.148 --> 03:19.717
I made up all that crap
about doing the procedure.

03:19.752 --> 03:22.720
He'll be dead within the hour,
and then we'll get the blame.

03:24.089 --> 03:27.525
So we will dump his body out here,

03:27.560 --> 03:30.194
fake the paperwork, say
we did the procedure,

03:30.229 --> 03:33.665
that he checked himself out, and
then rock out to Sheena Easton

03:33.699 --> 03:34.832
(grunts) all night long.

03:34.867 --> 03:35.833
(chuckles)

03:35.868 --> 03:37.035
What about his wife?

03:37.069 --> 03:39.370
It's her word against ours.

03:39.405 --> 03:40.939
(grunts)

03:41.907 --> 03:43.207
NURSE: Now, wait.

Catherine Hobart?

04:53.345 --> 04:55.213
Hi.

04:55.247 --> 04:57.749
I'm Dr. Brock Holt. I went to Harvard.

04:57.783 --> 05:00.051
And I'm Dr. Cassidy
Cascade. Nice to meet you.

05:00.085 --> 05:01.219
Right this way.
Right this way.

05:01.253 --> 05:02.520
I say "Right this way."
Okay.

05:04.623 --> 05:07.925
Okay, Catherine Hobart
of Laconia, New Hampshire.

05:07.960 --> 05:10.261
You've been diagnosed
previously with a severe case of

05:10.295 --> 05:12.964
hypertrichosis, aka Werewolf Syndrome.

05:12.998 --> 05:15.600
I was once arrested by a dogcatcher.

05:15.634 --> 05:17.802
Hey. Here's one thing
that is contraindicated

05:17.836 --> 05:21.239
to any treatment we
prescribe: self-pity.

05:21.273 --> 05:22.807
Your hair is so soft.

05:22.841 --> 05:24.976
What conditioner do you use?

05:25.010 --> 05:27.679
It's Kiehl's. I know it's expensive, but

05:27.713 --> 05:29.180
so worth it.
So worth it.

05:29.214 --> 05:32.784
You and I are gonna get along just fine.

05:32.818 --> 05:34.252
CASSIDY: Your condition
is being caused by

05:34.286 --> 05:36.521
an inverse mutation on chromosome 17.

05:36.555 --> 05:39.190
I know. I've seen hundreds of doctors.

05:39.224 --> 05:41.292
And I'd almost given up
hope, before Dr. Munsch

05:41.326 --> 05:43.361
found me in that
creepy disease chat room

05:43.395 --> 05:46.330
and told me if I came
here, she could cure me.

05:46.365 --> 05:48.166
Do I keep my word? Hi.

05:48.200 --> 05:51.469
I'm Dr. Cathy Munsch. And
welcome to my hospital.

05:51.503 --> 05:53.971
You know you're not really a doctor.

05:54.006 --> 05:55.940
(chuckles) Well, I'm sorry.

05:55.974 --> 05:57.542
But when I gave the commencement address

05:57.576 --> 05:59.310
at the University of
Pittsburgh last year,

05:59.344 --> 06:01.713
they gave me the actual
honorary doctorate

06:01.747 --> 06:03.114
they stripped from Bill Cosby.

06:03.148 --> 06:05.817
Anyway, Ms. Hobart,
you have the great honor

06:05.851 --> 06:08.986
of being our first patient
here at the C.U.R.E. Institute.

06:09.021 --> 06:11.889
Our motto is: "Where
the incurable are cured."

06:11.924 --> 06:13.191
I wouldn't get her hopes up.

06:13.225 --> 06:15.126
(whispers): She's incurable.

06:15.160 --> 06:17.962
MUNSCH: (scoffs) You want
to talk about impossible?

06:17.996 --> 06:20.031
You want to talk about
the world saying no,

06:20.065 --> 06:23.134
and you beating it like
a dog until you make it

06:23.168 --> 06:25.236
sit, stay and beg to say yes?

06:25.270 --> 06:27.839
Well, then you have
to be talking about one

06:27.873 --> 06:29.474
Dr. Dean Cathy Munsch

06:29.508 --> 06:33.044
and her journey to opening
this palace of healing.

06:34.513 --> 06:36.147
MUNSCH: <i>By now, you're
probably asking yourself,</i>

06:36.181 --> 06:38.516
<i>"Wait a second, isn't
this</i> the <i>Cathy Munsch,</i>

06:38.550 --> 06:41.252
<i>"the iconoclastic
bestselling author</i>

06:41.286 --> 06:42.754
<i>"whose very name has
become synonymous with</i>

06:42.788 --> 06:43.821
<i>"New New Feminism?</i>

06:43.856 --> 06:45.990
<i>How did she get here?"</i>

06:46.024 --> 06:47.725
<i>Well, I'll tell you.</i>

06:47.760 --> 06:52.563
When Pope Francis asked
me, "Cathy, what's next?"

06:52.598 --> 06:56.434
honestly, I found myself
at a loss for words.

06:56.468 --> 06:57.602
Why?

06:57.636 --> 06:59.270
Because I'd done it all.

06:59.304 --> 07:03.107
And I knew in that instant
that I needed a new cause:

07:03.142 --> 07:05.943
reforming America's health care system.

07:07.780 --> 07:10.414
Ask medical student what
do they want to become.

07:10.449 --> 07:13.384
They'll say plastic
surgeons, dermatologists.

07:13.418 --> 07:15.620
They want to perform Lasik.

07:15.654 --> 07:17.722
They want to make money.

07:17.756 --> 07:21.025
And that requires repeat customers.

07:21.059 --> 07:25.696
The perverse incentives baked
into our health care system

07:25.731 --> 07:27.732
keep people sick.

07:27.766 --> 07:32.403
Let me introduce you to the C.U.R.E.

07:32.437 --> 07:35.807
Caregivers United in
Restorative Ideology.

07:35.841 --> 07:40.978
It is entirely funded by my
own personal publishing fortune.

07:41.013 --> 07:43.881
And I am hiring only the best doctors,

07:43.916 --> 07:45.783
who are going to find cures

07:45.818 --> 07:49.620
for diseases 21st century medicine

07:49.655 --> 07:52.590
has deemed... incurable.

07:52.624 --> 07:54.625
I'd love to answer any
questions you might have.

07:54.660 --> 07:56.227
We have a few minutes.
WOMAN: Dr. Munsch.

07:56.261 --> 07:57.562
What about the Chanels?

07:57.596 --> 07:59.964
Do you have any comment
on what became of them?

07:59.998 --> 08:01.999
MUNSCH: <i>The Chanels.</i>

08:02.034 --> 08:04.101
<i>For two whole years,
I barely thought of them.</i>

08:04.136 --> 08:06.904
<i>But then a Netflix documentary
series turned them into</i>

08:06.939 --> 08:08.372
<i>a national obsession.</i>

08:11.043 --> 08:12.410
(gavel bangs)

08:12.444 --> 08:14.011
Please state your name for the record.

08:14.046 --> 08:17.849
I am Special Agent Denise Hemphill.

08:17.883 --> 08:20.151
And I take it you're currently

08:20.185 --> 08:21.919
an agent with the FBI.

08:21.954 --> 08:23.588
Correction.

08:23.622 --> 08:26.290
<i>Special</i> agent. Huh?

08:26.325 --> 08:27.625
(chuckles)

08:27.659 --> 08:29.360
At the time of the Wallace murders,

08:29.394 --> 08:31.963
I was an employee of the security firm

08:31.997 --> 08:33.965
Secure Enforcement Solutions,

08:33.999 --> 08:36.267
along with my dear friend Shondell,

08:36.301 --> 08:39.971
who was later stabbed in the
face and pushed out a car.

08:40.005 --> 08:42.773
Can I ask what you have to contribute to

08:42.808 --> 08:44.041
my clients' appeal?

08:44.076 --> 08:46.878
The killer confessed.

08:46.912 --> 08:49.513
And I got it right here!

08:49.548 --> 08:50.982
On videotape.

08:51.016 --> 08:52.283
(gallery murmurs)

08:52.317 --> 08:55.286
Yes. I orchestrated the whole thing.

08:55.320 --> 08:57.288
But you can't lay a hand on me.

08:57.322 --> 08:58.956
It's called double jeopardy.

08:58.991 --> 09:01.125
You can't be tried for
the same crime twice.

09:01.159 --> 09:03.027
But you haven't been tried twice.

09:03.061 --> 09:04.862
The <i>Chanels</i> were
tried the first time.

09:04.897 --> 09:08.065
But <i>someone</i> was convicted,
so it's double jeopardy.

09:08.100 --> 09:09.367
Uh, no.

09:09.401 --> 09:12.870
Again, <i>you</i> haven't
been tried yet at all.

09:12.905 --> 09:14.171
It's double jeopardy!

09:14.206 --> 09:15.673
It's single jeopardy!

09:15.707 --> 09:17.642
(banging on door, gasps)

09:17.676 --> 09:19.644
MUNSCH: <i>The Chanels
haven't been seen since.</i>

09:19.678 --> 09:22.680
<i>Those Kappa sisters were
nothing but a distant memory.</i>

09:22.714 --> 09:24.081
<i>Except for one.</i>

09:24.116 --> 09:27.919
<i>One that I felt
deserved an opportunity</i>

09:27.953 --> 09:29.754
to make something of
her life. (Zayday sighs)

09:29.788 --> 09:31.689
(sirens wailing in
distance, dog barking)

09:31.723 --> 09:33.190
Oh, no.

09:33.225 --> 09:34.725
I've got nothing to say to you.

09:36.128 --> 09:37.862
Are you smoking a joint?

09:37.896 --> 09:39.030
No.

09:39.064 --> 09:41.132
Yes.

09:43.769 --> 09:45.836
Can I buy you a drink?

09:45.871 --> 09:47.672
(sighs)

09:47.706 --> 09:50.041
ZAYDAY: I just want to distance myself

09:50.075 --> 09:51.542
from everything that happened.

09:51.576 --> 09:52.910
I hunkered down and
powered through undergrad

09:52.945 --> 09:54.345
in just a year and a half.

09:54.379 --> 09:57.448
After seeing all that death,
I felt the need to do something

09:57.482 --> 09:59.951
to prevent other people from dying.
Mm.

09:59.985 --> 10:02.219
So now I'm in my first
year of med school.

10:02.254 --> 10:04.221
Working three jobs to pay for it.

10:04.256 --> 10:06.223
I want to pay for it.
Excuse me?

10:06.258 --> 10:08.025
You heard me.

10:08.060 --> 10:10.361
Look, I like you, Zayday.

10:10.395 --> 10:12.563
I think you have tremendous potential.

10:12.597 --> 10:15.199
Now, I don't know if you're aware,

10:15.233 --> 10:16.600
but I've opened a teaching hospital.

10:16.635 --> 10:19.870
And I would like you
to come work for me.

10:19.905 --> 10:21.772
It will count toward
your residency, of course.

10:21.807 --> 10:25.776
Why would you want to go through
all this trouble to help me?

10:25.811 --> 10:27.111
I don't get it.

10:27.145 --> 10:30.748
Let's just say

10:30.782 --> 10:34.919
that I have a very
personal, deep-seated reason

10:34.953 --> 10:38.422
for wanting to see
this hospital succeed.

10:38.457 --> 10:41.125
And whether or not you
choose to believe it,

10:41.159 --> 10:45.429
I see you as being an
integral part of its success.

10:46.698 --> 10:48.099
What do you say?

10:49.134 --> 10:50.568
(sighs)

10:50.602 --> 10:53.237
I mean...

10:53.271 --> 10:55.439
(chuckles): yes!

10:55.474 --> 10:56.741
Yes, I'm in.

10:56.775 --> 10:58.275
Yes, you are.

10:58.310 --> 11:00.011
Congratulations.

11:00.045 --> 11:01.178
Cheers.

11:05.953 --> 11:08.844
Welcome to King Brock's kingdom,
where King Brock is king.

11:08.881 --> 11:11.383
Sometimes I like to
wheel in rando patients,

11:11.417 --> 11:12.618
not knowing their medical condition

11:12.652 --> 11:13.619
and just start cutting.

11:13.653 --> 11:14.953
Discovering as I go.

11:14.988 --> 11:19.224
Sometimes, I just stare
at my hands and cry.

11:19.258 --> 11:20.892
Hmm. Hi.

11:20.927 --> 11:23.829
You must be Dr. Cascade.
I'm Zayday Williams.

11:23.863 --> 11:25.297
I just want to let
you know straight out,

11:25.331 --> 11:26.898
I'm not interested in
having a girlfriend.

11:26.933 --> 11:28.967
And I know that's tough to hear.

11:29.002 --> 11:30.736
I'm basically female Viagra.

11:33.106 --> 11:34.139
I'm here for my MD,

11:34.173 --> 11:36.208
not my MRS.

11:36.242 --> 11:38.143
So, Dr. Holt, since you're
such a brilliant surgeon,

11:38.177 --> 11:39.711
tell me what you're doing here.

11:39.746 --> 11:42.080
I was up at the Mayo
Clinic when I got poached.

11:42.115 --> 11:43.849
Dean Munsch saw my layout
in <i>Playgirl...</i>

11:43.883 --> 11:45.050
"Ten Hottest Doctors,"

11:45.084 --> 11:46.985
and she offered me a
gigantic signing bonus.

11:47.020 --> 11:49.187
I became a doctor after seeing

11:49.222 --> 11:50.822
the terrible medical care
some of my family has gotten

11:50.857 --> 11:52.057
over the years.

11:52.091 --> 11:53.659
So, after I saw her TED talk online,

11:53.693 --> 11:54.660
I sought her out.

11:54.694 --> 11:56.028
I liked her philosophy and realized

11:56.062 --> 11:58.597
that's the kind of medicine
I wanted to study, too.

11:58.631 --> 11:59.765
Hmm.

11:59.799 --> 12:01.900
What happened to your wrist?

12:01.934 --> 12:03.101
Suicide attempt?

12:03.136 --> 12:04.336
(chuckling): No.

12:04.370 --> 12:05.337
I'm the recipient of the world's

12:05.371 --> 12:06.905
first complete hand transplant.

12:06.939 --> 12:07.939
Are you serious? That's
not your real hand?

12:07.974 --> 12:09.608
(loud bang)

12:09.642 --> 12:11.410
Of course it's my real hand.

12:11.444 --> 12:12.711
You buy a used car, is it yours

12:12.745 --> 12:14.713
or the guy who used to own it?

12:14.747 --> 12:16.915
I'm the genius, not the hand.

12:16.949 --> 12:17.949
How'd you lose it?

12:18.985 --> 12:20.719
Super Bowl accident.

12:20.753 --> 12:22.187
You played in the Super Bowl?

12:22.221 --> 12:23.355
Sorry.

12:23.389 --> 12:25.557
Super Bowl <i>party</i> accident.

12:25.591 --> 12:27.559
MEN (chanting): <i>Beast mode,
beast mode, beast mode!</i>

12:27.593 --> 12:29.594
(whistle blows) <i>It
was Super Bowl 49.</i>

12:29.629 --> 12:31.063
<i>I was working in a hospital</i>

12:31.097 --> 12:33.031
<i>up in Seattle.</i>

12:33.066 --> 12:34.900
<i>The next tragic series
of events still haunts me.</i>

12:34.934 --> 12:36.034
<i>First, the power goes out.</i>

12:36.069 --> 12:38.203
(all yelling)
Really?

12:38.237 --> 12:41.873
<i>Next, my idiot friend Matty
starts flipping light switches</i>

12:41.908 --> 12:43.275
<i>to see if they're working.</i>

12:43.309 --> 12:45.477
<i>Next, I started getting
stressed about the mess.</i>

12:45.511 --> 12:47.479
<i>I had surgery in the morning
and I can't go to sleep</i>

12:47.513 --> 12:48.547
<i>with a dirty house,</i>

12:48.581 --> 12:50.782
<i>so I started doing the dishes.</i>

12:50.817 --> 12:53.285
<i>The soap must have
lubed up my hands, because</i>

12:53.319 --> 12:55.721
<i>my Harvard class ring fell of.</i>

12:55.755 --> 12:57.289
<i>Did I tell you I went
to Harvard? Well, I did.</i>

12:57.323 --> 12:58.957
<i>Harvard University.</i>

12:58.991 --> 13:00.592
<i>Anyway, my ring fell
down the drain,</i>

13:00.626 --> 13:03.395
<i>I... I stuck my hand down
to retrieve it, not realizing</i>

13:03.429 --> 13:05.597
<i>that Matty had turned on
the garbage disposal.</i>

13:05.631 --> 13:08.133
<i>Then, the power came back on.</i>

13:08.167 --> 13:09.301
(disposal whirring)

13:09.335 --> 13:11.636
(men whooping) (screaming)

13:11.671 --> 13:16.041
(screaming continues)

13:18.511 --> 13:20.979
Oh, my God. That's horrible.

13:21.013 --> 13:22.414
That wasn't the worst part.

13:22.448 --> 13:24.916
You see, once in every generation,

13:24.951 --> 13:27.119
a surgical prodigy arises.

13:27.153 --> 13:29.087
That prodigy is me.

13:29.122 --> 13:30.856
At 23, I was the head surgeon

13:30.890 --> 13:34.359
on the operation that separated
the Hemsworth brothers.

13:34.393 --> 13:36.261
W-Wait. They're not even twins.

13:36.295 --> 13:38.497
Well, that's what made
the procedure so difficult.

13:38.531 --> 13:41.266
The point is, that for years,
I was the guy you called

13:41.300 --> 13:42.868
when no one else could do the job.

13:42.902 --> 13:44.336
I was the best.

13:44.370 --> 13:45.537
And, uh,

13:45.571 --> 13:47.672
I got my hand and...

13:47.707 --> 13:49.107
couldn't get a job.

13:49.142 --> 13:50.776
I was like "Shoeless" Joe Jackson,

13:50.810 --> 13:53.044
being banned from baseball in his prime.

13:53.079 --> 13:55.247
"Handless" Joe Jackson.

13:57.383 --> 14:00.018
For two years, I suffered

14:00.052 --> 14:02.621
as I watched other
lesser surgeons do my job.

14:02.655 --> 14:04.289
It broke my heart,

14:04.323 --> 14:06.725
'cause I knew I could still do it.

14:06.759 --> 14:08.126
I mean, yes,

14:08.161 --> 14:09.528
I would still see the patients.

14:09.562 --> 14:10.829
And don't get me wrong, I'm a genius

14:10.863 --> 14:12.531
at solving
medical problems...

14:12.565 --> 14:14.466
You know, connecting the dots, but...

14:14.500 --> 14:16.301
(loud bang) I'm a surgeon!

14:16.335 --> 14:17.502
It's my identity.

14:17.537 --> 14:19.004
And it's why I owe Dean Munsch

14:19.038 --> 14:21.339
for finding me and
giving me a second chance.

14:21.374 --> 14:23.708
That is admirable.

14:23.743 --> 14:25.477
Well, what choice do I have?

14:25.511 --> 14:26.845
This place is my last chance.

14:26.879 --> 14:29.748
If it doesn't work out,

14:29.782 --> 14:32.551
I've got nothing.

14:32.585 --> 14:33.585
Hmm.

14:33.619 --> 14:34.586
(gasps)

14:34.620 --> 14:35.921
You're freezing.

14:35.955 --> 14:37.556
Yeah, I, uh,

14:37.590 --> 14:38.723
I run cold.

14:38.758 --> 14:40.192
Oh, no, my grandmother runs cold.

14:40.226 --> 14:41.393
She has to wear a little
knit cap in the fall,

14:41.427 --> 14:42.894
but you...

14:42.929 --> 14:44.529
you feel like a block of ice.

14:44.564 --> 14:47.065
Well, I envy ice.

14:47.099 --> 14:49.501
At least, if you give
it warmth, it melts.

14:49.535 --> 14:51.036
WOMAN (over speaker): Dr. Semedla,

14:51.070 --> 14:52.838
please report to urology.

14:52.872 --> 14:54.840
CATHERINE: <i>I'm
basically a shut-in.</i>

14:54.874 --> 14:57.342
The only night I go out is Halloween.

14:57.376 --> 14:59.544
Just, I want a normal life.

14:59.579 --> 15:00.679
Of course you do, sweetheart.

15:00.713 --> 15:01.947
And-and you deserve that.

15:01.981 --> 15:03.381
Yeah, but like they say,

15:03.416 --> 15:04.583
deserve has got nothing to do with it.

15:04.617 --> 15:05.851
We were right the first time,

15:05.885 --> 15:06.885
there's nothing we could do.

15:06.919 --> 15:08.353
No, that's not possible.

15:08.387 --> 15:09.454
We just have to try harder.

15:09.488 --> 15:11.122
No, it... this
is an issue

15:11.157 --> 15:12.791
on a chromosomal level.
Right.

15:12.825 --> 15:15.060
It's be like asking us
to make your eyes blue.

15:15.094 --> 15:16.728
- Mm-hmm.
- Or me warmer.

15:16.762 --> 15:18.763
WOMAN (over speaker):
14. Chamberlain Jackson

15:18.798 --> 15:20.699
and his magic cart. Room 314.

15:20.733 --> 15:22.634
CATHERINE: <i>I knew it. I
should have never come here.</i>

15:22.668 --> 15:24.135
Let you get my hopes up.

15:24.170 --> 15:25.237
Oh...
Sorry to interrupt,

15:25.271 --> 15:26.972
but I thought I heard a patient

15:27.006 --> 15:28.807
who maybe needs a little
bit of cheering up.

15:28.841 --> 15:30.709
Excuse me?

15:30.743 --> 15:31.943
You can't just barge
into a room like this.

15:31.978 --> 15:33.211
Well, actually, that is my job.

15:33.246 --> 15:35.647
The Craigslist ad said, "uplifting male,

15:35.681 --> 15:38.950
"20 to 30, needed for
unpaid nurse's aid position

15:38.985 --> 15:40.218
to start immediately."

15:40.253 --> 15:41.887
How you doing, pretty little lady?

15:41.921 --> 15:43.922
My name is Chamberlain
Jackson, and I'm your

15:43.956 --> 15:45.924
friendly neighborhood candy striper.

15:45.958 --> 15:48.493
This right here is what
I call my magic cart.

15:48.527 --> 15:51.296
Take two of these and call
me in the morning, Hairy Mary.

15:51.330 --> 15:52.430
Boo-yeah!

15:52.465 --> 15:53.565
(laughs)

15:53.599 --> 15:54.966
I am leaving here

15:55.001 --> 15:56.067
right now.

15:56.102 --> 15:57.469
I've never been so embarrassed

15:57.503 --> 15:59.237
in all my life!
No, no, please.

15:59.272 --> 16:00.405
Just give us one week.

16:00.439 --> 16:01.940
Okay? I promise you,

16:01.974 --> 16:04.776
by next week, we
<i>will</i> have a cure.

16:08.047 --> 16:09.781
Yeah, sure.

16:11.017 --> 16:13.418
Okay.

16:13.452 --> 16:16.388
There's no way I can eat
that. S... stick to me.

16:17.490 --> 16:18.323
She's good.

16:19.892 --> 16:23.328
Okay. We need to have a discussion.

16:23.362 --> 16:24.362
(groans)

16:24.397 --> 16:25.630
Does it involve

16:25.665 --> 16:27.198
the inane decision

16:27.233 --> 16:29.434
to make our first case an incurable

16:29.468 --> 16:30.936
genetic disorder?

16:30.970 --> 16:33.305
Why on Earth did I insist

16:33.339 --> 16:36.141
on making Werewolf
Girl our flagship case?

16:36.175 --> 16:37.676
It'd be easier to cure Zika.

16:37.710 --> 16:39.210
Does it not bother you that

16:39.245 --> 16:41.646
this hospital staff is just
me and a whole bunch of dudes?

16:41.681 --> 16:42.681
I thought you were this

16:42.715 --> 16:44.382
icon of New Feminism, or something.

16:44.417 --> 16:46.785
Feminism... is just so boring.

16:46.819 --> 16:48.687
What <i>I'm</i> saying,

16:48.721 --> 16:51.156
is we could use some
more ladies around here.

16:53.392 --> 16:55.894
Okay. I get your point.

16:57.330 --> 16:59.864
And I have an idea.

16:59.899 --> 17:02.667
I know exactly what I'm gonna do.

17:08.538 --> 17:10.873
(sighs)

17:10.906 --> 17:13.209
(sighs) Good morning, idiot hookers.

17:13.242 --> 17:14.977
Good morning, Chanel.
Good morning, Chanel.

17:15.011 --> 17:16.811
CHANEL: <i>You would've thought</i>

17:16.847 --> 17:18.146

17:18.181 --> 17:20.182
<i>by an award-winning
Netflix documentary,</i>

17:20.217 --> 17:23.185
and let out of the asylum, that
<i>the Chanels would be heroes.</i>

17:23.220 --> 17:25.287
<i>You would be wrong.</i>

17:25.321 --> 17:27.490
<i>We were pariahs. We
were innocent of the crime,</i>

17:27.523 --> 17:30.159
<i>but guilty of being awful.</i>

17:30.193 --> 17:33.262
<i>Our grade-A blue ribbon
realness got us ostracized.</i>

<i>but quickly learned that

18:00.357 --> 18:02.358
(light applause) <i>And then,</i>

18:02.392 --> 18:03.993
<i>I realized something.

what's expected of you.

23:05.772 --> 23:08.741
All right, Chanels, your job is

23:08.775 --> 23:11.176
to follow the doctors
around and observe them.

23:11.211 --> 23:13.445
You just stand there silently.

23:13.480 --> 23:15.581
Something I like to call "ghosting."

23:15.615 --> 23:17.816
Point of order? I don't think
that's what "ghosting" is.

23:17.851 --> 23:20.085
"Ghosting" is when you leave a
party without saying good-bye.

23:20.120 --> 23:21.687
That's a French exit. Okay,
you guys are all idiots.

23:21.721 --> 23:23.021
"Ghosting" is when you've
been texting with a guy

23:23.056 --> 23:24.456
for a long time, and you know,

23:24.491 --> 23:26.191
things are going really, really well,

23:26.226 --> 23:27.459
and you think that he's
really into you, and then,

23:27.494 --> 23:28.994
all of a sudden, one day, he just stops

23:29.028 --> 23:30.362
texting back because he
finally saw what you look like.

23:30.397 --> 23:31.797
And so you just text
him, and you're like,

23:31.831 --> 23:33.165
"Hey, sexy, where'd you go?" And then

23:33.199 --> 23:34.600
he just doesn't answer
because he ghosted.

23:34.634 --> 23:36.668
Wait. Isn't "ghosting"
when you do a number two

23:36.703 --> 23:38.704
and you look down at the paper,
and there's nothing there,

23:38.738 --> 23:40.439
and so you stand up, and
you look in the toilet,

23:40.473 --> 23:42.441
and there's nothing there
either, because the turd somehow

23:42.475 --> 23:44.443
got shot down the hole
before you even flushed?

23:44.477 --> 23:47.446
That's ghosting.
All right! There are a lot of

23:47.480 --> 23:49.014
uses for the term "ghosting."

23:49.048 --> 23:51.049
The usage I am describing is

23:51.084 --> 23:54.219
where you stand
silently and say nothing.

23:55.488 --> 23:56.889
That's not ghosting.

23:58.691 --> 24:00.159
ZAYDAY: Well, Catherine,
we have good news.

24:00.193 --> 24:01.794
I've done a whole bunch
of research, and I think

24:01.828 --> 24:03.295
we may have found the way to treat

24:03.329 --> 24:04.696
and possibly cure your disease.

24:04.731 --> 24:06.031
Wait. Why are you doing all the talking?

24:06.065 --> 24:07.366
You're not even a doctor.

24:07.400 --> 24:09.067
Why aren't they telling me anything?

24:09.102 --> 24:11.737
I find that oftentimes silence
is the only appropriate response

24:11.771 --> 24:13.972
to the gaping expanse of
emptiness that stretches out

24:14.007 --> 24:15.641
before each and every one of us.

24:15.675 --> 24:18.410
Sorry. I'm just finishing up a text.

24:18.445 --> 24:20.078
And... sent.

24:20.113 --> 24:21.580
(phone whooshes) What?

24:21.614 --> 24:23.015
Who are they? Oh, don't mind us.

24:23.049 --> 24:25.184
We're ghosting. Yeah, we're ghosting.

24:25.218 --> 24:27.052
Isn't "ghosting" when
you leave a party early

24:27.086 --> 24:28.420
without saying good-bye?

24:28.455 --> 24:30.088
Yes, it is. Okay, just one question,

24:30.123 --> 24:31.523
and then I promise I'll start ghosting.

24:31.558 --> 24:32.891
How do you not, like, freak out

24:32.926 --> 24:34.493
every single time you
look in the mirror?

24:34.527 --> 24:36.895
Oh, my God, thank you. I
had the exact same question.

24:36.930 --> 24:38.764
You guys need to shut
your mouths right now!

24:38.798 --> 24:41.099
In a second. One last thing.

24:41.134 --> 24:42.868
So sometimes when I'm
feeling a little bit bloaty,

24:42.902 --> 24:44.336
and I really need to puke,

24:44.370 --> 24:46.104
I try to, like, envision
a hairy shower drain.

24:46.139 --> 24:47.940
And sometimes it works, and I can barf.

24:47.974 --> 24:50.108
But then, other times, the
image is just not gross enough.

24:50.143 --> 24:51.543
So I was just wondering
if you could maybe

24:51.578 --> 24:53.111
describe your shower drain for me.

24:53.146 --> 24:55.447
No! I'm...
Wait. I'm picturing it right now.

24:57.817 --> 24:59.718
(retching)

24:59.752 --> 25:01.220
(gulps)

25:01.254 --> 25:03.222
Mm-hmm. Thank you.
That'll work really well.

25:03.256 --> 25:05.090
I am sorry about their behavior.

25:05.124 --> 25:06.458
They're new to the hospital setting.

25:06.493 --> 25:08.460
I want to outline what I think could be

25:08.495 --> 25:10.529
a very promising experimental treatment.

25:10.563 --> 25:12.731
Researchers in Berlin have
isolated what is called

25:12.765 --> 25:14.867
a "brain-derived neurotrophic factor"

25:14.901 --> 25:16.268
that is prominently
involved in the control

25:16.302 --> 25:18.136
of Murine hair follicle cycling.

25:18.171 --> 25:20.138
This BDNF is active
in the basal forebrain.

25:20.173 --> 25:21.573
That's at the front of the brain,

25:21.608 --> 25:23.308
right above the eye sockets.

25:23.343 --> 25:25.744
Now, while such a procedure
has never been attempted before,

25:25.778 --> 25:29.147
it is my belief that
if we drill a small hole

25:29.182 --> 25:30.749
into the skull...

25:30.783 --> 25:32.651
You want to give me a lobotomy?!

25:32.685 --> 25:35.554
Now, Catherine, let's
not get our dander up.

25:35.588 --> 25:37.756
Now, listen, I have
to be honest with you.

25:37.790 --> 25:40.993
Now, in a case as severe as
yours, we have very few options.

25:41.027 --> 25:45.764
Now, this procedure, you know,
somewhat, uh, invasive and all,

25:45.798 --> 25:48.567
could provide a little relief

25:48.601 --> 25:49.968
from your symptoms.

25:50.003 --> 25:51.336
I really do want it all gone.

25:51.371 --> 25:53.405
We know that this is a big decision,

25:53.439 --> 25:54.973
and we don't want to rush you,

25:55.008 --> 25:57.142
but as this is an
experimental procedure,

25:57.176 --> 25:58.610
if you do decide to move forward,

25:58.645 --> 26:00.078
we're gonna need you to sign this

26:00.113 --> 26:02.481
consent form.

26:04.651 --> 26:07.019
Um...

26:07.053 --> 26:08.954

26:08.988 --> 26:11.023

your concerns, Nurse Hoffel.

26:59.005 --> 27:00.372
Listen, little girl,

27:00.406 --> 27:01.907
just so we're clear,

27:01.941 --> 27:03.408
I don't like you.

27:03.443 --> 27:07.512
You mess with me, and I

She was just filling

down in the examination room?

27:28.101 --> 27:29.434

27:29.469 --> 27:30.869

27:32.372 --> 27:34.039
Instead of choosing
to help the poor woman,

27:34.073 --> 27:35.440
you chose to humiliate her.

27:35.475 --> 27:37.843
Okay, once again,

27:37.877 --> 27:40.112
you have completely misread a situation

27:40.146 --> 27:42.414
and blown it way out of proportion.

27:42.448 --> 27:45.450
Dean Munsch, if you don't
fix this problem right now,

27:45.485 --> 27:48.120
I am fully prepared to
tender my resignation.

27:48.154 --> 27:49.888
Zayday, that won't be necessary.

27:49.922 --> 27:51.723
Chanels, you are now

27:51.758 --> 27:53.625
on academic probation,

27:53.660 --> 27:57.262
and confined to your
dormitories until further notice.

27:57.296 --> 27:59.431
And in the meantime,
I expect 10,000 words

27:59.465 --> 28:02.200
on bedside manner in
clinical practice by Thursday.

28:02.235 --> 28:04.870
Hold on. We still get
our salaries, right?

28:04.904 --> 28:06.405
(chuckles)
What?

28:06.439 --> 28:08.373
Our doctor's salaries?

28:08.408 --> 28:09.975
No! <i>What?!</i>

28:10.009 --> 28:12.210
(laughs) You were never getting paid.

28:12.245 --> 28:14.212
You're not doctors.

28:14.247 --> 28:15.981
You are getting free room and board,

28:16.015 --> 28:18.216
and you are getting put
through medical school.

28:18.251 --> 28:20.719
I don't know where you got the idea

28:20.753 --> 28:22.821
that you were also getting a salary.

28:22.855 --> 28:26.491
(Chanels screaming)

28:31.375 --> 28:33.502
You know, it isn't actually so bad at all.

28:33.521 --> 28:36.323
Seriously, after one day
of work, I, like, definitely

28:36.357 --> 28:38.658
needed a vacation to just,
like, unplug, you know?

28:38.693 --> 28:41.161
You stupid dugongs!

28:41.195 --> 28:44.130
Don't you get it? It wasn't so long ago

28:44.165 --> 28:47.233
that I was on the fast track to
becoming a network news anchor.

28:47.268 --> 28:51.171
I had a dream, and that dream
was to be the next Diane Sawyer,

28:51.205 --> 28:54.174
and now I realize that's
never gonna happen!

28:54.208 --> 28:56.710
Sorry. What did you say?
I zoned out for a sec.

28:57.945 --> 28:59.879
Wait a second.

28:59.914 --> 29:02.515
Maybe we won't be network news anchors.

29:02.550 --> 29:05.151
But what's stopping us
from becoming special

29:05.186 --> 29:07.187
medical correspondents for Fox News?!

29:07.221 --> 29:08.355
What are you talking about?

29:08.389 --> 29:09.889
We'll become TV doctors.

29:09.924 --> 29:11.424
We'll have our own doctor TV shows,

29:11.459 --> 29:13.660
like Dr. Drew or Dr. Phil or Dr. Oz,

29:13.694 --> 29:15.061
or... <i>The Doctors.</i>

29:15.096 --> 29:17.897
Just imagine the amazing
TV show I could do.

29:17.932 --> 29:19.566
I mean, I could have segments like,

29:19.600 --> 29:22.602
"How to Swallow a Tapeworm
with Dr. Chanel Oberlin."

29:22.637 --> 29:24.904
And then, Number Three
and I can do a segment

29:24.939 --> 29:28.174
where we come on the show with
exotic animals from the zoo!

29:28.209 --> 29:31.611
Damn it, Number Five, no
network would ever hire you.

29:31.646 --> 29:33.346
Your face is what they
in the business call

29:33.381 --> 29:35.682
"a channel changer."

29:35.716 --> 29:38.451
So what do we do? Get back
in Dean Munsch's good graces

29:38.486 --> 29:39.886
and get our medical degrees.

29:39.920 --> 29:42.088
How do we do that?

29:42.123 --> 29:43.923
By pulling an all-nighter
and figuring out a cure

29:43.958 --> 29:45.725
for that Werewolf Girl
before Zayday does.

29:45.760 --> 29:48.128
(crickets chirping)

30:03.511 --> 30:05.278
(gasps) Chanel.

30:05.312 --> 30:07.881
What are you doing here?
Scared the crap out of me.

30:07.915 --> 30:10.550
(chuckles) Well, I was pulling
an all-nighter with the Chanels

30:10.584 --> 30:12.485
trying to find a cure for Werewolf Girl,

30:12.520 --> 30:17.057
when suddenly I realized
that both Chanels are idiots.

30:17.091 --> 30:19.626
What are you doing here? Yeah, the same.

30:19.660 --> 30:21.961
We cannot perform a
lobotomy on that girl.

30:21.996 --> 30:23.596
So what have you come up with?

30:23.631 --> 30:26.066
Well, I'm just trying
to go over the facts.

30:26.100 --> 30:29.235
Uh, fact
number one...

30:29.270 --> 30:32.972
Patient's covered in thick
hair from head to toe. Right.

30:33.007 --> 30:35.742
Also a fact that hirsutism can be caused

30:35.776 --> 30:37.911
by polycystic ovary syndrome, but

30:37.945 --> 30:39.512
Catherine hasn't complained
of any abdominal pain

30:39.547 --> 30:40.914
or irregular periods.

30:40.948 --> 30:42.449
She does have irregular eating habits.

30:42.483 --> 30:44.250
Have you seen this nurse's report?

30:44.285 --> 30:46.619
It's gross. Beef,
liver and kidney beans?

30:46.654 --> 30:50.090
Crab legs and oyster sauce?

30:50.124 --> 30:54.794
12-egg omelet, no yolks,
just whites and canned tuna,

30:54.829 --> 30:56.429
three glasses of whole milk?

30:56.464 --> 30:59.799
That's not an unhealthy diet, per Se.

30:59.834 --> 31:02.535
I mean, all those foods
are loaded with vitamin D.

31:02.570 --> 31:04.204
Vitamin D

31:04.238 --> 31:05.839
is a very good...

31:05.873 --> 31:08.641
I should be on that
diet. It's good for dudes.

31:08.676 --> 31:12.479
(Chanel laughs) Boost the testosterone.

31:12.513 --> 31:14.147
Do...?

31:14.181 --> 31:17.617
Testosterone.

31:17.651 --> 31:18.618
That's it.

31:18.652 --> 31:19.786
Stop! Stop the operation!

31:19.820 --> 31:22.122
Chanel, you can't just
barge in here like that.

31:22.156 --> 31:24.858
Yeah, you guys do know this is
a sterile environment, correct?

31:24.892 --> 31:26.192
Testosterone.

31:26.227 --> 31:27.627
What?
Catherine,

31:27.661 --> 31:29.562
your diet is extremely
high in vitamin D.

31:29.597 --> 31:31.164
It's boosting your testosterone.

31:31.198 --> 31:34.200
We're gonna put you on a
soy-based diet immediately.

31:34.235 --> 31:36.636
It'll spike your estrogen and
bring your hormones into balance.

31:36.670 --> 31:38.304
Your boobs will
probably get bigger, too.

31:38.339 --> 31:39.873
(chuckles) Starting a regimen

31:39.907 --> 31:41.141
of dihydrotestosterone.

31:41.175 --> 31:42.876
It's a byproduct of testosterone.

31:42.910 --> 31:44.544
It's what causes hair loss in men.

31:44.578 --> 31:47.313
See, if we can introduce
enough DHT into your system,

31:47.348 --> 31:50.016
well, you'll lose hair
naturally, the way a man would.

31:50.050 --> 31:52.252
Most men, really.

31:52.286 --> 31:54.387
Interesting. Yeah. It really is a...

31:54.421 --> 31:56.422
compelling solution, now, isn't it?

31:56.457 --> 31:59.759
I mean, here you were, ready to, uh, jam

31:59.794 --> 32:01.194
an ice pick into the patient's brain

32:01.228 --> 32:04.097
and sort of randomly
root around willy-nilly,

32:04.131 --> 32:06.366
and then we come in at the last minute,

32:06.400 --> 32:09.669
We. saving the day, coming in with
a much better treatment option,

32:09.703 --> 32:13.673
rendering your original
procedure unnecessary. Bummer.

32:13.707 --> 32:16.376
Wait, hold on. So we're just
not gonna do the surgery?

32:16.410 --> 32:18.912
That's right. Change of plans.
I say we go with Chanel's idea

32:18.946 --> 32:21.347
first. (gasps, chuckles)

32:21.382 --> 32:24.350
Oh, so, Dr. Hot, just to be clear,

32:24.385 --> 32:27.520
you're saying that our idea
is better than Zayday's idea?

32:27.555 --> 32:29.756
Uh... yeah.

32:29.790 --> 32:31.925
In this case, I would.

32:31.959 --> 32:35.061
Awesome. Later, Zayday.

32:36.230 --> 32:37.931
Chanels!
(gasps)

32:37.965 --> 32:39.799
(panting)

32:53.050 --> 32:54.718
How's our little Hairy Mary

32:54.752 --> 32:57.187
doing this morning? (gasps)

32:57.221 --> 32:58.221
(screams)
(screams)

32:58.255 --> 32:59.589
Oh, my God, it worked.

32:59.623 --> 33:00.423
We cured her.

33:00.458 --> 33:01.424
You didn't tell me

33:01.459 --> 33:03.760
I would lose all of my hair!

33:03.794 --> 33:06.196
I have no hair anywhere!

33:06.230 --> 33:08.565
I look like a cancer patient!

33:08.599 --> 33:11.034
No. You look like a large baby.

33:11.068 --> 33:13.369
This is not okay!

33:13.404 --> 33:14.604
Now, hold on.

33:14.638 --> 33:16.439
I spent a full hour

33:16.474 --> 33:18.675
flirting with Dr. Brock to
try to find a cure for you.

33:18.709 --> 33:20.610
So I'll be damned if
we're giving up now.

33:20.644 --> 33:24.247
(sighs) Catherine, I think we need
to consider one more procedure.

33:24.281 --> 33:25.782
A makeover.

33:25.816 --> 33:28.251

Thank you so much!

34:34.385 --> 34:36.920
You girls changed my life!

34:36.954 --> 34:38.621
(chuckles)

34:38.656 --> 34:42.292
I'm gonna go take my first
Tinder profile picture.

34:42.326 --> 34:44.627
Side angle, dim light. We
got rid of all your hair,

34:44.661 --> 34:46.362
but you're still a good
15 pounds from being

34:46.397 --> 34:47.697
even a New Jersey six.

34:47.731 --> 34:51.067
Oh. Okay. Okay. Okay. (chuckles)

34:52.235 --> 34:54.337
Ladies, you have made

34:54.371 --> 34:56.505
this hospital very proud.

34:56.540 --> 34:58.174
I mean, we're batting 1000.

34:58.209 --> 35:00.210
Albeit with a very small sample size.

35:00.244 --> 35:02.178
ZAYDAY: I hope y'all
learned a valuable lesson

35:02.213 --> 35:03.980
about how fulfilling
being a doctor can be.

35:04.014 --> 35:06.549
And I hope you learned a
valuable lesson, Zayday,

35:06.584 --> 35:07.817
about how easy being

35:07.852 --> 35:09.052
a doctor can be.

35:09.086 --> 35:10.720
And maybe now we can put to bed

35:10.754 --> 35:12.956
all of your righteous
lecturing about hard work

35:12.990 --> 35:14.457
and accept the fact
that, through the power

35:14.491 --> 35:16.693
of the Internet, anyone can be an M.D.

35:16.727 --> 35:19.162
(chuckles) Let's go, ladies.

35:21.232 --> 35:23.199
(sighs)

35:23.234 --> 35:24.834
CHANEL #3: I don't know why
everyone talks about how hard it is

35:24.869 --> 35:26.970
being a doctor, because
we're doing an awesome job

35:27.004 --> 35:28.171
and it seems like
curing incurable diseases

35:28.205 --> 35:29.572
is super easy.
(chuckles)

35:29.607 --> 35:31.474
(elevator bell dings)

35:31.508 --> 35:33.476
Hello, Chanels.

35:33.510 --> 35:35.712
Still dressing like sluts, I see.

35:35.746 --> 35:37.480
Hello, Dean Munsch. Hello, Nurse.

35:37.514 --> 35:39.849
I thought I smelled something "Hoffel."

35:39.884 --> 35:41.818
(laughing): That's hilarious.

35:41.852 --> 35:45.355
I just registered that your
name sounds like "awful."

35:45.389 --> 35:48.391
You know, a broken clock
is still right twice a day.

35:48.425 --> 35:49.993
Just because you solved your first case

35:50.027 --> 35:51.761
doesn't make you doctors.

35:51.795 --> 35:55.098
Your obvious stupidity
will not get past me.

35:55.132 --> 35:57.734
I got your number,
you rich, dumb whores.

35:57.768 --> 35:59.002
Good to know.

35:59.036 --> 36:00.570
Come on, Chanels.

36:00.604 --> 36:03.039
It is appletini-o'clock.

36:03.073 --> 36:05.041
You don't belong here.

36:06.877 --> 36:08.778
Keep riding them.

36:08.812 --> 36:10.079
Hard.

36:10.114 --> 36:12.115
I've got plans for them.

36:14.485 --> 36:16.552
So do I.

36:16.587 --> 36:18.554
Good news. Dean Munsch was so impressed

36:18.589 --> 36:20.290
with our work on Chewbacca

36:20.324 --> 36:22.058
she decided to lift
our academic probation.

36:22.092 --> 36:23.693
Number Five still has to
work graveyard shift tonight,

36:23.727 --> 36:26.396
but, other than that,
we are fully liberated.

36:26.430 --> 36:29.098
Wait, why do I have to work
tonight and you guys don't?

36:29.133 --> 36:32.535
The graveyard shift, also
known as the virgin shift,

36:32.569 --> 36:35.038
the single and lonely shift,
and the dateless shift.

36:35.072 --> 36:37.240
And you're the only one
who doesn't have a date.

36:37.274 --> 36:39.609
I got asked out by Dr. Brock Holt.

36:39.643 --> 36:41.811
And I got asked out by Cassidy Cascade.

36:41.845 --> 36:44.047
(sighs)

36:44.081 --> 36:45.882
I like to look into these rooms

36:45.916 --> 36:47.550
and think about all the
people who died in them,

36:47.584 --> 36:50.286
how every hope and resentment
and emotional trauma

36:50.321 --> 36:52.121
they ever felt just
disappeared into irrelevance

36:52.156 --> 36:55.558
the second it took their
hearts to stop beating.

36:55.592 --> 36:57.560
Do you want to go on a date?

36:57.594 --> 36:59.228
Yeah. I guess.

36:59.263 --> 37:02.131
No! I refuse to accept this, okay?

37:02.166 --> 37:05.168
We need a fresh start, guys.
I want to reinvent myself.

37:05.202 --> 37:07.170
Chanel,

37:07.204 --> 37:11.140
remember back at the asylum
when we were really close and,

37:11.175 --> 37:14.911
you know, just like, sit on
the bench sharing secrets?

37:14.945 --> 37:17.080
First of all, I'm not
the one who decided

37:17.114 --> 37:19.315
to stop taking her meds
when we got released.

37:19.350 --> 37:21.751
And second, it's pretty lousy

37:21.785 --> 37:24.454
for you to make me feel
bad about trying to move on

37:24.488 --> 37:26.856
from the most traumatic
experience of my life.

37:26.890 --> 37:30.126
I think you should take the
six hours of working alone

37:30.160 --> 37:31.761
in this empty, creepy hospital

37:31.795 --> 37:34.097
to think about ways you
can reinvent yourself

37:34.131 --> 37:36.766
into a better friend.

37:36.800 --> 37:40.103
Sometimes I think you're
just not a very nice person.

37:40.137 --> 37:42.472
(gasps, sighs)

37:42.506 --> 37:44.173
(water running) CATHERINE:
Thank you for doing this.

37:44.208 --> 37:47.477
They said I have to take
two baths a day, or my skin

37:47.511 --> 37:50.279
will get flakey. You know,
doctors have been using

37:50.314 --> 37:52.215
hydrotherapy as a treatment
for nervous exhaustion

37:52.249 --> 37:53.983
since, like, forever.

37:54.018 --> 37:56.285
These used to put insane
people in these things.

37:56.320 --> 37:59.322
And no matter how much of
a raving lunatic you are,

37:59.356 --> 38:01.324
after an hour, you're,
like, super chill.

38:01.358 --> 38:03.559
But that water looks really hot.

38:03.594 --> 38:05.795
A hydrotherapy tub should be practically

38:05.829 --> 38:09.132
scalding, right to the point where
you can barely stand it. Hmm. Mm-hmm.

38:09.166 --> 38:11.567
Okay.
Oh.

38:11.602 --> 38:13.202
Oh. Mm-hmm.

38:19.043 --> 38:21.577
Oh!

38:21.612 --> 38:23.546
Trust me, I've done it before.

38:23.580 --> 38:27.483
It's amazing. Now I'm
just gonna close this lid.

38:27.518 --> 38:29.218
Mm-hmm.

38:29.253 --> 38:31.888
There we go.

38:31.922 --> 38:35.191
Uh, did it...? Did this just lock?

38:35.225 --> 38:37.593
Yeah, but don't worry.
I'll be here the whole time.

38:37.628 --> 38:41.197
Oh.
(humming)

38:41.231 --> 38:44.934
Wait. What are you do...? Duh. I'm
doing one, too, okay? I'm super stressed!

38:44.968 --> 38:46.702
(water splashing)

38:46.737 --> 38:48.638
Ooh. It's bracing.

38:54.078 --> 38:56.412
(lid squeals, thuds shut)

38:57.748 --> 39:00.016
Well, did you just
lock <i>yourself</i> in?

39:00.050 --> 39:02.618
How are we gonna get out of here?
Relax!

39:02.653 --> 39:04.787
I told Chamberlain that
we were coming down here.

39:04.822 --> 39:06.389
He's gonna come down for us in an hour.

39:06.423 --> 39:08.858
So just sit back and let the

39:08.892 --> 39:10.927
scalding hydrotherapy water

39:10.961 --> 39:14.430
melt away all of your
stress and anxiety.

39:17.801 --> 39:20.236
Okay.

39:24.808 --> 39:27.844
(clock ticking)

39:29.113 --> 39:31.481
(hinges creaking)

39:36.086 --> 39:38.421
(hinges creaking, door closes)

39:38.455 --> 39:41.257
Chamberlain, is that you?

39:45.462 --> 39:49.031
(metallic scraping)

39:57.875 --> 40:00.309
