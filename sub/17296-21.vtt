Buenos dias, amigos!

00:27.375 --> 00:29.812
You fools ready
to celebrate Cinco de Mayo?

00:32.032 --> 00:33.903
I love Cinco de Mayo!

00:33.946 --> 00:34.991
What day is that again?

00:35.035 --> 00:37.124
It is Cinco de Mayo!

00:38.603 --> 00:40.910
- He asked what day.
- Cinco.

00:42.085 --> 00:43.217
Perhaps tell us the month.

00:43.260 --> 00:44.522
Mayo.

00:46.133 --> 00:47.656
Answer the question!

00:47.699 --> 00:51.181
On what day during what month
does Cinco de Mayo occur?

00:51.225 --> 00:52.965
Cinco de Mayo.

00:54.228 --> 00:55.359
Bro, be cool!

00:55.403 --> 00:58.406
It's simple. Cincomeans five,

00:58.449 --> 00:59.711
andmayo means May!

00:59.755 --> 01:02.584
So, Cinco de Mayo means
the fifth of May!

01:02.627 --> 01:05.021
Well, that's today!

01:08.546 --> 01:10.592
What are we celebrating,
exactly?

01:10.635 --> 01:14.726
Basically, back in the 1800's, them
colonizers was trying to take over Mexico.

01:14.770 --> 01:17.555
And everybody was like,
"Oh, snap. It's over!"

01:17.599 --> 01:19.340
'Cause there was, like,
a ton of colonizers,

01:19.383 --> 01:22.256
but then the Mexican army
dudes was like, "Nuh-uh-uh.

01:22.299 --> 01:23.474
"Get out of here, fools."

01:23.518 --> 01:25.346
And so Mexico won!

01:25.389 --> 01:28.000
So... When did that happen?

01:28.044 --> 01:29.263
May 5!

01:29.306 --> 01:30.786
Don't you mean...

01:30.829 --> 01:32.309
Cinco de Mayo?

01:35.443 --> 01:38.098
And now we celebrate
by having a party

01:38.141 --> 01:39.838
and eating that good food!

01:41.927 --> 01:45.583
Check it, yo. A delicious
Cinco de Mayo feast.

01:45.627 --> 01:49.239
Chalupas, mole poblano,
and chiles en nogata!

01:55.550 --> 01:59.119
Mmm! Spicy! Y delicioso!

01:59.162 --> 02:03.384
Mmm. Ooh, the fiery sweats
feel the amazing!

02:06.387 --> 02:07.823
Caliente.

02:09.564 --> 02:11.392
Bro, get in on this.

02:11.435 --> 02:13.263
I will not get in on that.

02:13.307 --> 02:15.396
Spicy foods are
my only weakness.

02:15.439 --> 02:18.181
Try some pico de gallo.
It ain't spicy!

02:18.225 --> 02:19.965
Pico de gallo, eh?

02:20.009 --> 02:21.837
Eh... What's in it?

02:21.880 --> 02:22.968
Mostly tomatoes.

02:23.012 --> 02:24.666
I like tomatoes.

02:24.709 --> 02:28.365
Ah, it burns!
It burns!

02:28.409 --> 02:30.193
You said tomatoes!

02:30.237 --> 02:32.369
Oh, there's some onions
in there, too.

02:32.413 --> 02:34.197
Onions?

02:34.241 --> 02:35.416
It's fire!

02:35.459 --> 02:37.244
It's agony!

02:37.287 --> 02:40.247
Perhaps you might enjoy the
unadorned chip of the tortilla?

02:42.162 --> 02:43.337
A plain chip?

02:43.380 --> 02:45.208
I can do that.

02:50.344 --> 02:53.042
Ow, ow, ow, ow. I can't breathe, I
can't breathe, I can't breathe.

02:53.085 --> 02:55.305
It was just a lightly salted
chip, dude.

02:55.349 --> 02:57.307
Salted?

02:59.527 --> 03:02.660
Are you trying to kill me?
No more!

03:02.704 --> 03:04.401
There must be some way
to get the friend Robin

03:04.445 --> 03:07.099
to eat the food item
he would normally avoid.

03:07.143 --> 03:08.231
Hmm...

03:13.497 --> 03:15.107
Oh! I gots it.

03:16.457 --> 03:18.372
Avocado!

03:18.415 --> 03:20.939
No... No...
No more of your spicy foods.

03:20.983 --> 03:24.160
Bro, this avocado
is a super food.

03:24.204 --> 03:27.424
Avocados got those good
monounsaturated fats, son.

03:27.468 --> 03:29.644
The kind that can
help lower cholesterol.

03:29.687 --> 03:31.863
See you later, triglycerides!

03:31.907 --> 03:34.214
The avocado
is also the sodium free,

03:34.257 --> 03:36.825
and can reduce
the risk of the heart disease.

03:36.868 --> 03:38.653
They really do sound super.

03:38.696 --> 03:40.263
But are they spicy?

03:40.307 --> 03:42.570
Bro, they don't taste
like nothing.

03:46.835 --> 03:48.271
Oh, yeah.

03:48.315 --> 03:51.535
Avocado, I love you.

03:56.410 --> 03:58.499
So mushy... So flavorless...

03:58.542 --> 04:00.457
I like it!

04:02.111 --> 04:03.330
Crime alert.

04:05.462 --> 04:07.856
- Should we go with him?
- He'll be fine.

04:13.383 --> 04:15.820
Play time is over, Cinderblock.

04:35.536 --> 04:37.320
Whoa... This power...

04:37.364 --> 04:38.669
Where is it coming from?

04:38.713 --> 04:41.368
The shield... It looks
like avocado skin!

04:41.411 --> 04:43.544
Avocado!

04:43.587 --> 04:45.241
Superfood.

04:49.158 --> 04:50.333
Peel punch!

04:51.639 --> 04:54.250
Skin slam, straight for it!

04:55.991 --> 04:57.079
Seed smash!

04:58.385 --> 04:59.429
Laser beam!

05:02.127 --> 05:04.304
Mega-poof!

05:08.351 --> 05:11.180
It seems avocados
truly are a superfood.

05:17.142 --> 05:18.361
Huh? What?

05:18.405 --> 05:20.755
It appears these powers
are only temporary.

05:20.798 --> 05:22.452
Huh. Not a problem...

05:24.106 --> 05:27.022
Mmm!

05:28.415 --> 05:29.938
With the power of avocados,

05:29.981 --> 05:32.593
I will be
the greatest force for good

05:32.636 --> 05:34.159
Jump City has ever seen!

05:36.597 --> 05:38.250
Sandwich time.

05:38.294 --> 05:39.556
Gimme that B.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.384
Gimme that L.

05:41.428 --> 05:42.472
Gimme that T.

05:42.516 --> 05:44.387
Gimme that A...
Hey, where's my A?

05:44.431 --> 05:46.476
You'll have to live
with the B, L, and T for now.

05:46.520 --> 05:48.173
The A belongs to me.

05:51.612 --> 05:54.441
Not enough.
I need more.

05:54.484 --> 05:56.268
Bro, you ate all them A's!

05:56.312 --> 05:57.922
I need more!

05:57.966 --> 05:59.837
Without avocados, I won't be
able to keep the city safe.

05:59.881 --> 06:03.624
With each bite I grow
more powerful.

06:03.667 --> 06:04.538
You should slow down.

06:04.581 --> 06:06.583
Avocados are high in the fats.

06:06.627 --> 06:07.628
It's the good kind!

06:07.671 --> 06:10.065
Dude, too much good fat
is bad fat.

06:10.108 --> 06:12.197
And... Aren't you worried
they're expensive?

06:12.241 --> 06:14.591
A superfood like this
is worth every penny.

06:14.635 --> 06:16.376
But I admit, cost is a concern.

06:16.419 --> 06:18.595
That's why I'm growing my own.

06:18.639 --> 06:22.904
This seed will one day
be a mighty avocado tree.

06:22.947 --> 06:25.515
It will give me an endless
supply of superfood,

06:25.559 --> 06:28.431
making me
an unstoppable force of good.

06:28.475 --> 06:31.216
Soon... Soon.

06:31.260 --> 06:33.523
Why are you saying "soon"
like that?

06:33.567 --> 06:35.090
Because it roughly describes
the time it will take

06:35.133 --> 06:37.658
for me to become an
unstoppable force of good.

06:37.701 --> 06:41.488
Soon.
Very soon. Very soon.

06:41.531 --> 06:45.579
But, in the meantime, I need fresh
avocados to maintain my power.

06:45.622 --> 06:46.754
Well, you ate them all.

06:46.797 --> 06:48.930
No problem,
I'll have my power back...

06:48.973 --> 06:50.366
Soon...

06:50.410 --> 06:52.890
Soon. Soon.

06:54.109 --> 06:56.067
But wait, there's more.

06:56.111 --> 06:57.417
Call within the next 4 seconds
and get a second Bat Army Knife

06:57.460 --> 06:58.461
absolutely free!

07:00.637 --> 07:02.160
Crime alert!

07:02.204 --> 07:03.466
A break-in
at the Jump City warehouse!

07:03.510 --> 07:04.946
Anyone seen Robin?

07:04.989 --> 07:06.774
Not since he left to get
more of the avocados.

07:06.817 --> 07:08.166
Then he'll have to catch up.

07:08.210 --> 07:09.646
Titans, booyah!

07:17.437 --> 07:19.656
An avocado warehouse?

07:19.700 --> 07:21.702
Oh, no...

07:21.745 --> 07:23.747
Oh, yes...

07:30.711 --> 07:32.930
Why you stealing
all these A's, fool?

07:32.974 --> 07:35.324
Oh, I'm merely borrowing them.

07:35.367 --> 07:36.891
With the strength they give me,

07:36.934 --> 07:39.502
I will soon
make this superfood...

07:39.546 --> 07:41.286
The only food.

07:56.693 --> 07:59.304
Ah, my little seedling.
It's funny...

07:59.348 --> 08:02.525
The beginning of its life
is the end of yours.

08:02.569 --> 08:03.787
What are you doing, Robin?

08:03.831 --> 08:07.356
The man you once knew
as Robin is no more.

08:07.399 --> 08:10.315
I am the God of Avocados!

08:10.359 --> 08:13.318
The Avogodo!

08:19.629 --> 08:21.109
What's happening?

08:28.725 --> 08:31.989
I will replace every crop in the
country with this superfood.

08:32.033 --> 08:34.818
Avocado in Idaho,
avocado in Florida.

08:34.862 --> 08:37.299
Avocado everywhere!

08:37.342 --> 08:39.170
You, sir, have gone mad.

08:39.214 --> 08:43.784
There is no place for you, sir,
in my new avocado kingdom.

08:45.655 --> 08:47.309
You can't do us like this!

08:49.006 --> 08:51.574
Goodbye, you pathetic oranges.

08:53.054 --> 08:55.883
Hello, my magnificent superfood.

08:55.926 --> 08:58.363
- Yo!
- Titans?

08:58.407 --> 09:01.758
That's right!
You's going down, Avogodo!

09:01.802 --> 09:02.977
Titans, shaplow!

09:13.161 --> 09:14.162
Huh?

09:15.206 --> 09:16.207
Ooh!

09:32.397 --> 09:33.398
Ow!

09:34.965 --> 09:37.533
The dude is unstoppable!
How can we beat him?

09:39.753 --> 09:43.321
How about a little
Cinco de Mayo celebration, yo?

09:50.851 --> 09:52.809
No, my precious A's!

09:52.853 --> 09:54.245
What have you done?

09:54.289 --> 09:57.248
Just made some delicious
guacamole, yo.

09:57.292 --> 10:00.338
Guacamole, huh?
What's in it?

10:00.382 --> 10:01.905
Mostly avocados.

10:01.949 --> 10:05.343
I like avocados. Hmm...

10:05.387 --> 10:06.736
Okay. Not bad.

10:06.780 --> 10:09.696
Soon my...
My throat's a little itchy.

10:09.739 --> 10:11.654
Soon you will...

10:11.698 --> 10:13.438
Oh, the heat.

10:13.482 --> 10:15.919
- What's in this?
- You know, avocados...

10:15.963 --> 10:18.661
- Onions!
- The salt and the pepper.

10:18.705 --> 10:20.750
And a dash of hot sauce.

10:20.794 --> 10:23.710
Avocado is ruined!

10:23.753 --> 10:27.104
Too much spice!
Too much spice.

10:28.758 --> 10:30.194
You are defeated!

10:30.238 --> 10:33.502
Like the colonizers.

10:33.545 --> 10:36.853
We'll have to keep you here until the
effects of the avocado wear off.

10:36.897 --> 10:38.115
Thanks, guys.

10:38.159 --> 10:40.030
I can't believe I fell
for that marketing hype.

10:40.074 --> 10:42.119
Superfoods... What a scam.

10:42.163 --> 10:43.860
Can we get you the anything?

10:43.904 --> 10:46.515
Just a glass of water, thanks.

10:56.090 --> 10:58.266
Soon...

10:58.309 --> 11:01.008
Soon... Soon!
