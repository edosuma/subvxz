WEBVTT

00:07.311 --> 00:09.400
<i>I found a new
purpose down here.</i>

00:09.400 --> 00:10.619
I think we should get married.

00:11.707 --> 00:13.622
<i>We kissed.</i>

00:13.622 --> 00:16.146
You're the only person down
here who understands me.

00:16.146 --> 00:17.495
The exiles are back.

00:19.062 --> 00:20.672
They were looking for this.

00:20.672 --> 00:22.979
This must be Moore's
journal, his complete work.

00:22.979 --> 00:25.025
It's our way home.

00:25.025 --> 00:27.853
<i>I don't know if it was James
or Kira who sent the exiles,</i>

00:27.853 --> 00:30.552
but I want us to figure
this out together.

00:30.552 --> 00:31.727
I do too.

00:32.771 --> 00:34.382
<i>So why are you back?</i>

00:34.382 --> 00:36.036
<i>I told Gavin that I had a
plan to bring everyone home.</i>

00:36.036 --> 00:37.254
But the truth is, I don't.

00:37.254 --> 00:38.647
I'm here to kill James.

00:48.135 --> 00:49.788
Where are you going?

00:49.788 --> 00:51.964
I have to get back to Gavin.

00:51.964 --> 00:53.096
But we just started.

00:53.096 --> 00:54.532
You brought me
Dr. Moore's notes,

00:54.532 --> 00:55.881
so we could complete
his work and get

00:55.881 --> 00:57.535
Gavin and his family home.

00:57.535 --> 00:59.189
We're not making
any progress, Dad.

00:59.189 --> 01:00.756
So we'll keep at it.

01:00.756 --> 01:02.845
Gavin doesn't even
know I have them.

01:02.845 --> 01:06.283
If I don't get back, you know
where he'll turn for help.

01:06.283 --> 01:08.111
You're worried about James.

01:09.460 --> 01:14.552
All those years ago, I--
I swore I'd protect your son

01:14.552 --> 01:17.077
and keep him away
from your husband.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.775
I failed.

01:19.775 --> 01:21.342
I'm sorry.

01:22.256 --> 01:24.432
You did what you could.

01:28.392 --> 01:30.960
Still, give me the papers.

01:30.960 --> 01:33.571
I'll keep working
on Moore's notes.

01:33.571 --> 01:35.138
You go.

01:35.138 --> 01:36.835
Protect your son.

02:39.289 --> 02:40.986
There's the man of the hour.

02:40.986 --> 02:43.511
Got to tell you, Riley is very
excited about your wedding.

02:43.511 --> 02:45.295
Look, this is her idea.

02:45.295 --> 02:46.818
You look very dapper,
my friend.

02:46.818 --> 02:50.170
I'm glad everyone's
looking forward to it.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.128
Uh, how are you doing?

02:52.128 --> 02:53.129
I'm good.

02:53.129 --> 02:55.000
I'm good, just--

02:55.000 --> 02:56.437
busy.

02:56.437 --> 02:57.873
Sounds like me at my wedding.

02:57.873 --> 03:01.093
I got to tell you, I had
my doubts on my big day.

03:01.093 --> 03:02.312
Listen.

03:02.312 --> 03:05.968
Marriage is never perfect.

03:05.968 --> 03:07.796
But from what I can tell,
you're built to handle

03:07.796 --> 03:09.145
whatever comes your way.

03:09.145 --> 03:10.494
The gift exchange
is the most important part

03:10.494 --> 03:11.582
of a Tonga wedding.

03:11.582 --> 03:13.193
You need to share
some of your wine.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.324
What wine?

03:14.324 --> 03:15.717
Who says I have wine?

03:15.717 --> 03:16.544
Oh, my god.

03:16.544 --> 03:18.328
Are you kidding, Judah?

03:18.328 --> 03:21.244
Look, your lips
are stained red,

03:21.244 --> 03:22.680
and you smell like
Two-Buck Chuck. OK?

03:22.680 --> 03:24.639
Cough up the stash.
- OK, fine, fine, fine.

03:24.639 --> 03:26.118
You can have two
bottles from Argentina,

03:26.118 --> 03:27.207
but nothing from France.
- What?

03:27.207 --> 03:28.295
No need to argue.

03:28.295 --> 03:29.774
There will be plenty to drink.

03:29.774 --> 03:31.341
I've heard the fermented
corn is quite good.

03:31.341 --> 03:32.951
Gross.
You can have that.

03:32.951 --> 03:34.431
No, you can have it.

03:34.431 --> 03:36.172
No, man, I'm gonna
be drinking your wine.

03:36.172 --> 03:37.869
Hey.

03:37.869 --> 03:40.785
I think this would look
pretty great on you.

03:40.785 --> 03:42.396
Yeah.

03:42.396 --> 03:43.962
It's cute for a dress that was
pulled off a wardrobe truck

03:43.962 --> 03:45.225
and fell through a sinkhole.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.878
- I'm gonna try it on.
- OK.

03:49.098 --> 03:51.883
So nice to
see her smile like that.

03:51.883 --> 03:53.494
I know.

03:53.494 --> 03:55.060
Maybe a wedding is what
everybody needs right now.

03:55.060 --> 03:57.193
Right?

03:57.193 --> 03:59.848
Actually, there's
something I need to ask you.

03:59.848 --> 04:03.025
I'd like you
to be my best woman.

04:03.025 --> 04:06.289
You've seen me at my very
worst and at my best.

04:06.289 --> 04:10.075
I know we haven't known each
other long, but you're family.

04:10.075 --> 04:11.642
Ty.

04:11.642 --> 04:13.688
Oh, I would be honored.
I would.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.477
What else?

04:22.392 --> 04:26.091
Eve, I went to the building,

04:26.091 --> 04:29.356
and I learned something I need
to share with you and Gavin--

04:29.356 --> 04:31.096
alone.

04:33.490 --> 04:37.277
Project Blue Moon--
what does that even mean?

04:38.408 --> 04:39.975
James named the
project after a drawing

04:39.975 --> 04:42.586
that Gavin made
when he was a child.

04:42.586 --> 04:45.981
So he wants to go back
to when I was a kid?

04:45.981 --> 04:47.330
I think so.

04:47.330 --> 04:49.593
If he wants to
change his past,

04:49.593 --> 04:51.726
it will also change
all of ours.

04:51.726 --> 04:53.945
Gavin will be raised by James.

04:55.120 --> 04:57.384
You and Eve will never meet.

04:57.384 --> 04:58.950
Josh and Izzy--

04:58.950 --> 05:00.648
They'll never be born.

05:02.432 --> 05:05.217
And I'll never come
to 10,000 BC.

05:05.217 --> 05:07.394
I'll never find the second
chance I found here.

05:07.394 --> 05:08.873
We can't let this happen.

05:08.873 --> 05:10.440
How do we know this
is even real, OK?

05:10.440 --> 05:11.789
Ty heard this from Kira,

05:11.789 --> 05:14.879
the woman who sent
the exiles to attack us.

05:14.879 --> 05:16.403
How can we believe
anything she says?

05:16.403 --> 05:18.100
It wasn't just Kira.

05:18.100 --> 05:21.756
In my session with James,
I saw his desire to go back.

05:21.756 --> 05:23.323
And you saw that he
was willing to sacrifice

05:23.323 --> 05:24.411
his own grandchildren?

05:25.890 --> 05:26.978
I don't know.

05:26.978 --> 05:29.503
But I may have
a way of finding out.

05:29.503 --> 05:32.201
I invited James to the wedding.

05:32.201 --> 05:35.335
Gavin, we can talk to him,

05:35.335 --> 05:37.032
find out the truth
about Blue Moon.

05:39.948 --> 05:41.253
Could work.

05:41.253 --> 05:42.733
Can you give us a second?

05:46.998 --> 05:48.435
I do not like this.

05:48.435 --> 05:51.960
My father is the only
one who can save your life.

05:51.960 --> 05:54.310
He can use that channel
to fix the machine

05:54.310 --> 05:56.007
and send you and everyone home.

05:56.007 --> 05:57.357
But I'm not willing
to sacrifice the lives

05:57.357 --> 05:58.662
of our children.

05:58.662 --> 06:00.098
Which is why I won't
give him the journal

06:00.098 --> 06:02.318
unless I'm sure about him.

06:02.318 --> 06:03.711
I meant what I said yesterday.

06:03.711 --> 06:04.929
OK?

06:04.929 --> 06:06.844
From now on,
we make choices together.

06:06.844 --> 06:08.716
I won't do anything
unless you agree.

06:11.980 --> 06:13.155
I trust you.

06:22.599 --> 06:25.385
Ty just told me
about Blue Moon.

06:25.385 --> 06:26.777
We have to stop James.

06:28.083 --> 06:30.390
I told Gavin I would
give him a chance.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.826
I have to trust him, Levi.

06:31.826 --> 06:33.610
I can't risk throwing
everything away.

06:33.610 --> 06:35.177
Gavin isn't seeing
clearly right now,

06:35.177 --> 06:36.657
because James is his father.

06:38.093 --> 06:40.791
He's gonna be protected
at the wedding.

06:40.791 --> 06:42.967
I don't know if I'm gonna
be able to get close to him.

06:42.967 --> 06:44.099
But you're family.

06:44.099 --> 06:45.579
You can.

06:45.579 --> 06:47.058
Are you hearing what
you're asking me to do?

06:47.058 --> 06:48.582
What I'm asking you
to do is make sure

06:48.582 --> 06:51.759
that Josh and Izzy stay safe.

06:51.759 --> 06:56.328
Now, the only way to do
that is to kill James.

06:56.328 --> 06:57.504
There's no other way?

06:57.504 --> 06:59.157
You know me.

06:59.157 --> 07:00.681
I wouldn't be doing
this if there was.

07:03.510 --> 07:05.033
As long as he is alive,
he is a threat.

07:08.732 --> 07:10.952
Please, Eve.
I can't do this without you.

07:17.480 --> 07:20.048
I can't figure out how
Aaron had this journal.

07:20.048 --> 07:21.615
He has some connection
to this place,

07:21.615 --> 07:23.486
but I don't know what it is.

07:23.486 --> 07:25.183
So the guy has that
book on him the whole time

07:25.183 --> 07:26.358
you're with him,
and he never says

07:26.358 --> 07:27.664
anything about how he got it?

07:27.664 --> 07:29.623
Never.

07:29.623 --> 07:32.452
But look, he added something
to it on the last page.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.497
Here.
That's Aaron's handwriting.

07:38.066 --> 07:39.937
What are those, Bible verses?

07:39.937 --> 07:41.765
Same ones
he made us memorize.

07:41.765 --> 07:42.766
And look how he wrote them.

07:42.766 --> 07:43.985
Some are horizontal.

07:43.985 --> 07:45.465
Some are vertical.

07:45.465 --> 07:48.206
It's like some puzzle,
but I can't solve it.

07:48.206 --> 07:50.121
Hey, don't beat
yourself up about it.

07:50.121 --> 07:52.689
I mean, maybe the Bible
verses don't mean anything.

07:52.689 --> 07:54.691
But it does.

07:54.691 --> 07:57.041
I can feel it.

07:57.041 --> 07:58.869
Aaron always said
that these verses

07:58.869 --> 08:00.392
served a higher purpose.

08:00.392 --> 08:01.916
I just thought he meant
getting into heaven.

08:01.916 --> 08:03.700
But now I think that
he must have been

08:03.700 --> 08:05.441
talking about something else.

08:05.441 --> 08:06.529
You know, I hate the fact you
still got to think

08:06.529 --> 08:08.400
about this creep.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.098
He took away
so much of my life.

08:10.098 --> 08:12.883
I just want all the things
that I went through

08:12.883 --> 08:14.537
to be for some purpose.

08:14.537 --> 08:19.542
Hey, whatever it takes,
we're gonna figure it out.

08:20.761 --> 08:24.460
I'm here for you.

08:24.460 --> 08:25.896
OK.

08:25.896 --> 08:29.509
Hey, lovebirds,
you guys coming or what?

08:39.083 --> 08:41.651
Thank you for coming.

08:47.570 --> 08:49.398
Today is the chance
to celebrate.

08:49.398 --> 08:51.574
Here in this fort, we are
people of mixed cultures.

08:51.574 --> 08:53.663
With our union here today,
we look forward

08:53.663 --> 08:54.925
to welcoming even more.

08:54.925 --> 08:56.666
Please enjoy the bounty.

08:56.666 --> 09:00.017
- Great.
- Oh, thank you.

09:04.805 --> 09:06.284
Everything OK?

09:06.284 --> 09:07.851
You know, it's funny.

09:07.851 --> 09:11.159
Just a short time ago,
I was a man with no future.

09:11.159 --> 09:13.378
Now I've got one,
and I'm terrified

09:13.378 --> 09:15.467
of someone taking it away.

09:15.467 --> 09:19.036
We can't control tomorrow,
only today.

09:19.036 --> 09:21.082
But today is good.

09:24.912 --> 09:26.653
There's no DJ,
no photo booth.

09:26.653 --> 09:30.439
But I heard there might be
some dancing.

09:30.439 --> 09:32.223
I didn't know
you could dance.

09:32.223 --> 09:33.790
Are you kidding me?

09:33.790 --> 09:35.096
Back home I'm--

09:36.140 --> 09:38.229
kind of a legend.

09:38.229 --> 09:39.666
Never do that again.

09:41.232 --> 09:44.409
But you could talk me into
a slow dance

09:44.409 --> 09:46.498
since you clean up so nice.

09:46.498 --> 09:48.370
Why, thank you.

09:49.545 --> 09:53.810
Uh, guys,
I think I need to leave.

09:53.810 --> 09:55.507
You just got here.

09:55.507 --> 09:57.509
The warriors
are giving me wedding gifts

09:57.509 --> 10:00.774
because I killed Taamet,
like I'm some kind of hero.

10:00.774 --> 10:03.472
Look.

10:04.691 --> 10:08.085
Sweet belt.
What's the problem?

10:08.085 --> 10:10.610
I have been doing everything
that I can to try and forget

10:10.610 --> 10:12.742
the fact that I
stabbed a man to death,

10:12.742 --> 10:15.440
and I really don't
want a trophy for it.

10:15.440 --> 10:16.964
Then there's that
girl behind me.

10:16.964 --> 10:18.313
She won't leave me alone.

10:23.884 --> 10:26.016
I need a mindful moment.

10:38.376 --> 10:41.684
Gavin, how does it feel
to be back home

10:41.684 --> 10:43.033
after all these years?

10:43.033 --> 10:44.687
It's a lot to take in.

10:44.687 --> 10:48.038
I remember a lot of it-- the
garden, the smell of the fire.

10:48.038 --> 10:50.171
That's where
you used to sleep.

10:51.738 --> 10:52.782
Come.

10:52.782 --> 10:55.350
Let's meet some old friends.
- OK.

10:58.440 --> 11:03.053
You go ahead.
I'll catch up.

11:08.624 --> 11:10.713
Levi?

11:10.713 --> 11:11.758
What are you doing?

11:14.586 --> 11:16.240
This is the Datura flower.

11:17.851 --> 11:19.200
It's a slow-acting poison.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.071
All you have to do
is remove its seeds

11:21.071 --> 11:22.899
and put it in his drink.

11:22.899 --> 11:25.554
All right, listen.
I've thought about it.

11:25.554 --> 11:26.903
I'm not on board with this.

11:26.903 --> 11:28.339
Eve--

11:28.339 --> 11:29.689
I know the risks,
but I made Gavin a promise.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.734
And I'm not gonna
go back on that.

11:31.734 --> 11:33.431
- He'll understand in time.
- How?

11:33.431 --> 11:34.868
Because this is
about your children.

11:34.868 --> 11:36.608
Yeah.

11:36.608 --> 11:38.045
And if he's right about James,
then he can save my children.

11:38.045 --> 11:39.699
All of us can go home.

11:39.699 --> 11:42.266
No, Eve.

11:42.266 --> 11:43.703
Why is this
so important to you?

11:43.703 --> 11:46.140
Because James took
everything from me.

11:46.140 --> 11:47.489
My wife--

11:50.405 --> 11:53.234
My wife is dead because of him.

11:53.234 --> 11:55.105
So maybe I can stop him
before he takes

11:55.105 --> 11:56.585
your family from you as well.

11:58.805 --> 12:00.197
What happened?

12:09.032 --> 12:12.819
Marissa and I were
tracking sinkholes together.

12:12.819 --> 12:14.168
One of them caught us
by surprise.

12:14.168 --> 12:16.344
The building collapsed.

12:16.344 --> 12:18.346
I survived.
She didn't.

12:24.047 --> 12:26.310
I'm really sorry.

12:26.310 --> 12:27.790
I really am.

12:27.790 --> 12:29.618
But when you said Gavin
wasn't thinking straight,

12:29.618 --> 12:31.141
there's no way you are either.

12:31.141 --> 12:32.316
This isn't who you are, Levi.

12:32.316 --> 12:33.796
You're not a murderer.

12:33.796 --> 12:35.015
James is responsible
for those sinkholes.

12:35.015 --> 12:36.494
He has blood on his hands.

12:36.494 --> 12:38.279
Do you want to have
blood on your hands too?

12:38.279 --> 12:41.499
When Gavin was drinking and I
was spiraling, I was so lost.

12:41.499 --> 12:44.111
And you reminded me
of who I was.

12:44.111 --> 12:46.461
You steadied me.

12:46.461 --> 12:49.420
Please let me be
that for you now.

12:50.595 --> 12:52.859
Please?

13:01.737 --> 13:02.782
Thank you.

13:06.046 --> 13:07.438
Let's get back to the wedding.

13:11.747 --> 13:13.270
James.

13:13.270 --> 13:14.532
I'm so glad
you decided to come.

13:14.532 --> 13:16.273
Well,
it's an honor to be included.

13:16.273 --> 13:18.798
It's been some time since I've
been to a good celebration.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.190
Come on, please.

13:20.190 --> 13:21.235
So how are you?

13:21.235 --> 13:23.803
I am--

13:23.803 --> 13:25.369
well-rested.

13:25.369 --> 13:26.893
You know, last night I thought
about everything you said,

13:26.893 --> 13:29.330
and something clicked.

13:29.330 --> 13:31.419
I had my first sound
sleep in months.

13:31.419 --> 13:34.291
For so long,
I thought there was

13:34.291 --> 13:37.251
only one possible
relationship with my son.

13:37.251 --> 13:38.948
And now?

13:38.948 --> 13:40.645
Now I'm learning to see
that you have to appreciate

13:40.645 --> 13:42.169
what's in front of you.

13:42.169 --> 13:43.213
Gavin.

13:43.213 --> 13:44.519
It's good to see you.

13:44.519 --> 13:46.216
Thanks for coming.

13:46.216 --> 13:48.175
What do you say
you show me around?

13:48.175 --> 13:49.524
Yeah, please.

13:54.485 --> 13:56.923
You need to come join
everybody at the party

13:56.923 --> 13:59.447
and have, like,
a little bit of fun.

13:59.447 --> 14:00.752
Just keeping an eye on James.

14:00.752 --> 14:03.059
I'm not crazy about
letting him in.

14:03.059 --> 14:06.410
I don't like it either.

14:06.410 --> 14:07.890
But I know that's
not the reason why

14:07.890 --> 14:10.850
you're sitting all alone.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.635
OK, fine.

14:13.635 --> 14:18.031
Maybe all this got me
thinking about my wedding.

14:18.031 --> 14:20.511
Did I ever tell you about this
tiny church we got married at?

14:20.511 --> 14:22.644
Only about 100 times.

14:24.472 --> 14:27.301
Yeah, well,
sometimes it just feels

14:27.301 --> 14:33.655
like other people are moving
on, making new memories here.

14:33.655 --> 14:35.396
And mine are all
still back home.

14:35.396 --> 14:38.486
Dad, we're gonna
go home soon.

14:38.486 --> 14:39.922
We found Moore's journal.

14:39.922 --> 14:41.445
Caroline's working
on the notes now.

14:41.445 --> 14:42.925
These are all
really good things.

14:42.925 --> 14:46.059
So you did find
something in Moore's cave.

14:49.932 --> 14:51.020
Josh.

14:51.020 --> 14:52.065
Hey, come on.

14:52.065 --> 14:54.415
Can we talk about this?

14:54.415 --> 14:55.546
I think I heard plenty.

14:55.546 --> 14:57.070
I'm sorry I lied.

14:57.070 --> 14:59.246
After everything
we've been through,

14:59.246 --> 15:00.856
you still don't trust me?

15:00.856 --> 15:03.380
No, Josh, this
isn't about trust.

15:03.380 --> 15:05.295
Caroline made me promise
to keep this a secret.

15:05.295 --> 15:06.296
Not from your dad.

15:07.950 --> 15:09.343
So it sounds like
maybe it's just about me.

15:18.004 --> 15:19.222
I could slip 'em
a few oranges,

15:19.222 --> 15:21.268
get them
to play "Brown-Eyed Girl."

15:23.052 --> 15:24.967
You all right?

15:24.967 --> 15:26.316
What's up?

15:26.316 --> 15:27.839
I thought coming
to the wedding

15:27.839 --> 15:29.624
would help me get my mind
off those Bible verses,

15:29.624 --> 15:31.147
but it's not working.

15:34.498 --> 15:37.458
You know,
I might know how to fix this.

15:40.548 --> 15:41.897
If you're up for an adventure.

15:43.551 --> 15:44.856
How could I say no to that?

15:53.517 --> 15:54.954
Did she say why she's here?

15:54.954 --> 15:59.959
No, just that she
wanted to speak to you.

16:03.527 --> 16:05.616
Kira, you can't be here.

16:05.616 --> 16:07.009
How are you feeling, Doctor?

16:07.009 --> 16:09.011
You've taken me
away from my wedding.

16:09.011 --> 16:10.012
What is it that you want?

16:10.012 --> 16:11.448
To talk about James.

16:11.448 --> 16:13.015
There's nothing
to talk about.

16:13.015 --> 16:15.061
I heard you sent the
exiles to our clearing.

16:15.061 --> 16:17.585
I was only following
James' orders.

16:17.585 --> 16:19.979
He is obsessed with
getting that journal.

16:19.979 --> 16:24.200
Until he has it,
he'll hurt anyone he needs to.

16:24.200 --> 16:25.506
Let me in, Ty.

16:25.506 --> 16:27.029
I can stop him.

16:27.029 --> 16:29.684
And I will use that journal
for the greater good.

16:29.684 --> 16:31.773
Why should I believe you?

16:31.773 --> 16:33.993
Because I actually care.

16:33.993 --> 16:37.997
I joined this project to help
people, to save our world.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.737
James is only thinking
about himself.

16:39.737 --> 16:41.739
And what if I told you
that you're wrong,

16:41.739 --> 16:43.611
that he might have changed?

16:43.611 --> 16:46.483
Then I'd say he's
gotten inside your head.

16:47.441 --> 16:51.967
The moment he has that journal,
you'll see who he really is.

16:54.796 --> 16:56.754
It's time for you to leave.

16:56.754 --> 16:59.148
I'm sorry to say this
on your wedding day.

17:00.889 --> 17:02.630
This will not end well for you.

17:08.375 --> 17:13.162
Keep your eyes closed.

17:14.076 --> 17:15.208
Well, we're here.

17:15.208 --> 17:16.339
Oh.

17:16.339 --> 17:19.647
You can--
you can open your eyes.

17:19.647 --> 17:21.388
Nature's hot tub.

17:21.388 --> 17:22.171
What do you think?

17:22.171 --> 17:25.435
I think it's amazing.

17:25.435 --> 17:27.046
But that's not all.

17:30.136 --> 17:31.789
No.
Is that a Pop-Tart?

17:31.789 --> 17:32.790
How did you--

17:32.790 --> 17:33.791
It sure is.

17:33.791 --> 17:36.142
How did you...

17:36.142 --> 17:41.234
Uh, Lucas, how is
this supposed to help me

17:41.234 --> 17:43.105
figure out those Bible verses?

17:43.105 --> 17:45.977
It'll take your mind off it.

17:45.977 --> 17:47.631
Sometimes when
you've got a problem,

17:47.631 --> 17:51.505
the best thing you can do
is just walk away for a bit.

17:51.505 --> 17:54.551
Mm.

17:54.551 --> 17:55.813
So jump in.

17:55.813 --> 17:56.814
Relax.

17:56.814 --> 17:58.033
See if it helps.

18:00.949 --> 18:02.298
Come on.

18:02.298 --> 18:03.430
It's really nice.

18:07.173 --> 18:09.523
Oh, I-- I won't peek.

18:43.078 --> 18:44.079
You're right.

18:44.079 --> 18:45.472
This is relaxing.

18:45.472 --> 18:46.864
Ah, see?

18:46.864 --> 18:47.865
I told ya.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.361
You're back.

19:48.361 --> 19:50.145
What the hell
is James doing here?

19:50.145 --> 19:53.409
Maybe first you should
tell me where you've been.

19:53.409 --> 19:55.933
I was worried.

19:55.933 --> 19:59.720
I did find a piece of Moore's
work, pages of his notes.

19:59.720 --> 20:02.113
I've been with my father
trying to make sense of it.

20:02.113 --> 20:03.289
But we couldn't.

20:03.289 --> 20:04.464
OK.

20:04.464 --> 20:06.509
There's something
I need to show you.

20:06.509 --> 20:07.771
We found this yesterday.

20:07.771 --> 20:11.297
It's Moore's journal,
his completed work.

20:13.908 --> 20:15.605
Let me take a look.

20:15.605 --> 20:17.041
OK.

20:22.090 --> 20:24.614
So this is where you grew up.

20:24.614 --> 20:26.964
Yeah.

20:26.964 --> 20:30.620
I wish I could remember
more from before then, but,

20:30.620 --> 20:32.535
you know.

20:32.535 --> 20:35.103
Hey,
after we figure this out,

20:35.103 --> 20:36.931
I'm gonna take you
to a spot you loved.

20:36.931 --> 20:38.280
It's up on a hill.

20:38.280 --> 20:41.152
You used to picnic
and watch the mammoths move

20:41.152 --> 20:43.067
across the valley.

20:43.067 --> 20:45.635
It's--it's beautiful up there.

20:45.635 --> 20:47.768
You know,
I'd really like that.

20:47.768 --> 20:49.248
I would.

20:54.688 --> 20:56.080
You should go.

20:58.213 --> 21:01.825
Thank you all
for being here today.

21:01.825 --> 21:04.654
Every day since we've got
here has been a struggle,

21:04.654 --> 21:09.093
and we've certainly faced
our share of hardships.

21:09.920 --> 21:12.053
But we've also had
our share of blessings.

21:12.053 --> 21:14.316
Today is one of them.

21:14.316 --> 21:18.407
We're surrounded by friends, family,

21:18.407 --> 21:20.409
and the people we love.

21:20.409 --> 21:23.194
No matter what time
we're in,

21:23.194 --> 21:26.154
those are the things
that matter.

21:26.154 --> 21:28.548
You've each been given
a handful of seeds.

21:28.548 --> 21:31.420
When you throw them,
we each share in the blessings

21:31.420 --> 21:33.509
of this union and this day.

21:33.509 --> 21:36.860
You know,
there's one of my traditions

21:36.860 --> 21:38.253
I'd also like to share.

21:40.429 --> 21:42.039
May I?

22:03.757 --> 22:05.236
Now let's celebrate!

22:27.520 --> 22:29.260
Can you save some
for the rest of us?

22:29.260 --> 22:30.653
Sorry.
I was just--

22:30.653 --> 22:32.220
You were swiping
booze at a wedding

22:32.220 --> 22:33.352
when no one was watching.

22:33.352 --> 22:34.918
Your secret's safe with me.

22:34.918 --> 22:36.616
You must be Josh.

22:38.226 --> 22:39.183
I'm James.

22:39.183 --> 22:40.663
I know.

22:40.663 --> 22:43.623
It's nice to finally
meet my grandson.

22:43.623 --> 22:47.409
Looking at you is like
staring into a mirror--

22:47.409 --> 22:51.979
a very old mirror.

22:51.979 --> 22:53.023
I'm sorry.

22:53.023 --> 22:54.285
This must be a lot.

22:54.285 --> 22:55.243
You know,
we need to break the ice.

22:55.243 --> 22:56.592
Fermented corn.

22:56.592 --> 22:58.681
It's not as bad as it sounds.

22:58.681 --> 23:00.204
No, not at all.

23:04.557 --> 23:05.427
See?

23:05.427 --> 23:06.863
Ice officially broken.

23:06.863 --> 23:08.387
Tell me more about you.

23:08.387 --> 23:10.301
How are you enjoying
the wedding?

23:10.301 --> 23:12.042
The drinks are good.

23:12.042 --> 23:13.522
Girls are complicated.

23:13.522 --> 23:16.046
That sounds a lot
like my teenage years.

23:16.046 --> 23:18.397
So even in the future
girls crush your soul.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.268
Oh, yeah.

23:20.268 --> 23:22.749
I wish I could tell you
that our species

23:22.749 --> 23:26.492
has evolved as much
as our technology, but no.

23:26.492 --> 23:28.407
I see you two have met.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.713
I would say we've
become fast friends.

23:30.713 --> 23:31.975
Yeah.

23:31.975 --> 23:34.282
He was giving me some
relationship advice.

23:34.282 --> 23:36.458
You want some real advice?

23:36.458 --> 23:38.460
What I've come
to realize as of late

23:38.460 --> 23:42.812
is that mistakes are made
in every relationship.

23:42.812 --> 23:46.337
All you can do is apologize,
hope you've learned a lesson,

23:46.337 --> 23:47.469
and move on.

23:50.124 --> 23:51.473
You can't move backwards.

23:51.473 --> 23:53.823
I like this version of you.

23:53.823 --> 23:57.653
Being outside of the
building suits you.

23:57.653 --> 24:02.658
Look at us,
three generations all together.

24:02.658 --> 24:04.747
I wouldn't trade
this day for anything.

24:15.541 --> 24:17.020
- Hey.
- Hi.

24:17.020 --> 24:18.021
You having fun?

24:18.021 --> 24:19.196
Yeah.

24:19.196 --> 24:21.416
You have some admirers.

24:21.416 --> 24:24.027
Why don't you go talk to 'em?

24:24.027 --> 24:25.028
It's a wedding.

24:25.028 --> 24:26.029
Have fun.

24:26.029 --> 24:27.422
Maybe later.

24:30.773 --> 24:33.123
You all right?

24:33.123 --> 24:36.083
It's probably nothing, but--

24:36.083 --> 24:37.519
Levi seemed a little off.

24:37.519 --> 24:38.825
I know.
I know.

24:38.825 --> 24:40.391
I think maybe
being at a wedding

24:40.391 --> 24:41.915
just brought up
feelings about his wife.

24:41.915 --> 24:43.307
Yeah.

24:43.307 --> 24:45.527
That's what I thought,
so I followed him

24:45.527 --> 24:46.659
just-- just to talk.

24:46.659 --> 24:48.399
But he was picking flowers.

24:48.399 --> 24:49.836
What flowers?

24:49.836 --> 24:53.143
Ones that Scott told
us were poisonous.

24:53.143 --> 24:54.188
Mom.

24:54.188 --> 24:56.103
Mom, what's going on?

25:12.641 --> 25:15.383
Eve, everything OK?

25:15.383 --> 25:16.689
Yeah.

25:16.689 --> 25:18.517
Yeah,
everything's gonna be fine.

25:21.171 --> 25:23.565
I was just given the
most inappropriate gift

25:23.565 --> 25:26.176
for someone dealing with the
emotional fallout of killing

25:26.176 --> 25:29.832
a man with a freaking dagger.

25:29.832 --> 25:31.355
You want to leave?

25:31.355 --> 25:34.445
No, man, I want to
keep drinking and play

25:34.445 --> 25:36.796
my favorite game, No Filter.

25:36.796 --> 25:38.319
I've never heard of that.

25:38.319 --> 25:39.755
Easy to pick up.

25:39.755 --> 25:41.844
Just point at someone
and say the truth about them

25:41.844 --> 25:43.063
without any--

25:43.063 --> 25:44.064
Filter?

25:44.064 --> 25:45.065
Yeah.

25:45.065 --> 25:46.066
OK.

25:46.066 --> 25:48.285
Uh--

25:48.285 --> 25:50.592
is convinced those
dance moves are sexy.

25:51.985 --> 25:54.683
Someone really
needs to talk to him.

25:54.683 --> 25:56.119
Right?

25:56.119 --> 25:58.339
Mm... bah!

25:58.339 --> 26:00.384
Very attractive
when she's angry.

26:00.384 --> 26:01.472
No, dude.

26:01.472 --> 26:03.300
- What? What?
- Scott.

26:03.300 --> 26:04.780
Oh, come on.
Come on. Get over it.

26:04.780 --> 26:05.868
Real talk.

26:05.868 --> 26:07.087
Your turn.

26:07.087 --> 26:08.392
Fine.

26:08.392 --> 26:09.785
Uh--

26:12.135 --> 26:14.094
Prefers lying over the truth.

26:14.094 --> 26:14.921
Wow.

26:14.921 --> 26:16.705
That got dark quick.

26:16.705 --> 26:18.185
This a fun game.

26:18.185 --> 26:21.971
Can I play?

26:21.971 --> 26:23.364
Worried about what
I'm gonna say next?

26:23.364 --> 26:25.888
Go on and get us
all drinks now.

26:25.888 --> 26:28.064
Love that idea.

26:31.415 --> 26:33.853
I just want to ask
a simple question.

26:33.853 --> 26:36.943
You like my daughter?

26:36.943 --> 26:39.641
Is it OK to say yes?

26:39.641 --> 26:42.601
Well, if you like someone,
you want them to be happy.

26:42.601 --> 26:47.301
So why are you both
miserable at a wedding?

26:47.301 --> 26:51.044
I'm-- I'm not sure I want
to have this conversation.

26:51.044 --> 26:55.396
Well, we're having it.

26:55.396 --> 27:00.096
I know you've gone through some
tough times with your parents.

27:00.096 --> 27:03.186
You've seen what secrets
can do to a relationship.

27:03.186 --> 27:06.320
You're afraid of the same
thing happening to you.

27:09.236 --> 27:10.280
Yeah.

27:10.280 --> 27:12.848
Yeah, I guess
that's kind of it.

27:12.848 --> 27:16.243
I understand
how you're feeling.

27:16.243 --> 27:18.637
But a lot of this
relationship crap

27:18.637 --> 27:21.161
boils down to one question.

27:21.161 --> 27:24.512
You want to be right,
or you want to be together?

27:53.062 --> 27:55.543
Caroline.

27:57.414 --> 27:58.546
You're here.

27:58.546 --> 27:59.678
I should go.

27:59.678 --> 28:00.940
Please.

28:00.940 --> 28:02.028
It doesn't have to be
like this.

28:06.597 --> 28:11.080
Do you think maybe
we could talk for a bit?

28:11.080 --> 28:14.693
You sent agents after me,
exiles after my family.

28:14.693 --> 28:16.172
And now you want to talk?

28:16.172 --> 28:17.521
I didn't know about
any of that, I swear.

28:17.521 --> 28:18.740
You know about
every decision that

28:18.740 --> 28:20.002
comes out of that building.

28:20.002 --> 28:22.352
Times have changed.

28:22.352 --> 28:24.093
There are others
who see the project

28:24.093 --> 28:25.878
very differently than I do.

28:25.878 --> 28:28.184
I am capable of many things,

28:28.184 --> 28:30.709
but hurting you
was never one of them.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.449
I don't believe you.

29:01.783 --> 29:02.741
Whoa.

29:02.741 --> 29:04.307
Easy, fellas.

29:04.307 --> 29:05.961
I just want to have a drink
with the big boss man.

29:05.961 --> 29:08.181
It's all right.

29:08.181 --> 29:10.531
Any friend of Gavin's
is a friend of mine.

29:12.576 --> 29:14.840
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:14.840 --> 29:17.277
Wanna dance?

29:20.802 --> 29:22.717
So I have this habit--

29:22.717 --> 29:24.545
more of a ritual, actually,
from the air force.

29:24.545 --> 29:26.242
Every time I'm
stationed somewhere new,

29:26.242 --> 29:28.244
I find the guy in charge
and buy him a beer.

29:28.244 --> 29:29.985
I'm kind of a guest here,
but a wise man

29:29.985 --> 29:32.901
never turns down a free drink.

29:32.901 --> 29:33.989
Cheers.

29:40.300 --> 29:42.128
- Everything OK?
- I'll be right back.

29:42.128 --> 29:43.825
Stay right there.
Don't move.

29:45.871 --> 29:48.612
Hey, Levi, I think you
accidentally grabbed my drink.

29:48.612 --> 29:50.963
I don't think I did.

29:50.963 --> 29:52.878
We were just trying to
have a conversation.

29:52.878 --> 29:54.183
Yeah, sure, I know.

29:54.183 --> 29:55.489
I just wanted to
get my drink back.

29:55.489 --> 29:56.838
No need to argue
on my behalf.

29:56.838 --> 29:59.232
Thanks.

29:59.232 --> 30:02.148
My mistake.

30:02.148 --> 30:03.279
Let's get back
to our friends.

30:03.279 --> 30:04.628
Yeah?
Can you excuse us?

30:04.628 --> 30:05.891
Yeah, no problem.

30:05.891 --> 30:07.980
Let's have a drink
another time.

30:07.980 --> 30:09.372
Definitely.

30:19.556 --> 30:21.297
OK, that bite
just changed my life.

30:21.297 --> 30:22.385
You have to try this.

30:22.385 --> 30:23.909
No, come on.
I got it for you.

30:27.477 --> 30:28.652
So did any of this help?

30:28.652 --> 30:31.351
So far I got nothing.

30:31.351 --> 30:34.963
It's been a pretty
great day, though.

30:52.938 --> 30:55.723
Silas, hey!

30:55.723 --> 30:56.593
Hey.

30:56.593 --> 30:58.682
You have to help me.

30:58.682 --> 31:01.685
I have to get to my grandson.

31:01.685 --> 31:03.339
You're all in terrible danger.

31:07.561 --> 31:09.128
I thought we agreed
you were done with this.

31:09.128 --> 31:10.825
I know you were trying
to help me earlier,

31:10.825 --> 31:12.696
but you're the one who's
not thinking clearly.

31:12.696 --> 31:15.351
James is dangerous.

31:15.351 --> 31:16.700
Levi, after everything
I've seen today,

31:16.700 --> 31:18.528
I think maybe he
deserves a chance.

31:18.528 --> 31:20.008
So he got in your head too?

31:20.008 --> 31:21.009
Levi--

31:21.009 --> 31:22.924
Hey.

31:22.924 --> 31:23.882
What's going on?

31:26.362 --> 31:28.495
Whatever it is, you two
need to tell me right now.

31:33.674 --> 31:35.937
Gavin,
Levi tried to kill James today,

31:35.937 --> 31:37.112
but it's over now.

31:37.112 --> 31:39.680
I was trying
to protect your family.

31:39.680 --> 31:44.598
You knew about this,
and you didn't talk to me?

31:49.603 --> 31:52.127
I mean, I thought we were
past all the secrets.

31:52.127 --> 31:54.521
Clearly, I was wrong.
- Gavin, just hear me out.

31:54.521 --> 31:56.566
No, no, no, no.
You and I, we're through.

31:56.566 --> 31:59.874
I don't want you
anywhere near my family.

32:12.147 --> 32:15.063
I have to check on Caroline.

32:21.809 --> 32:22.636
Silas!

32:22.636 --> 32:26.031
He's been shot.

32:26.031 --> 32:28.685
I'll go get Sam.

32:28.685 --> 32:30.992
They're here.

32:30.992 --> 32:32.385
Who?

32:35.344 --> 32:36.998
- Caroline?
- Gavin.

32:36.998 --> 32:38.260
Gavin.

32:38.260 --> 32:41.437
Uh-- listen.

32:41.437 --> 32:44.701
Something terrible
has happened.

32:54.755 --> 32:56.626
I found her like this.

32:56.626 --> 32:59.020
She's gone.

32:59.020 --> 33:00.282
I'm sorry.

33:00.282 --> 33:01.501
Mom.

33:04.547 --> 33:06.462
I'm sorry.

33:06.462 --> 33:09.552
Did you-- did you do this?

33:09.552 --> 33:11.076
I would-- I would never.
Why would--

33:11.076 --> 33:12.077
For the journal.

33:12.077 --> 33:13.469
What journal?

33:13.469 --> 33:17.473
She was trying
to protect me from you!

33:17.473 --> 33:19.084
I should've never
let you come here.

33:19.084 --> 33:22.826
You did let me come because
you know-- you know

33:22.826 --> 33:24.306
deep down
that you can trust me.

33:24.306 --> 33:27.005
No.

33:27.005 --> 33:30.008
I needed to know the truth
about you, about Blue Moon.

33:33.054 --> 33:38.233
If you want the truth,
Gavin, I can give that to you.

33:38.233 --> 33:41.715
Blue Moon is real.

33:41.715 --> 33:44.674
I was in pain.

33:44.674 --> 33:48.765
I needed some way
to make it stop.

33:48.765 --> 33:54.032
But then I met Izzy,
and I met you, and I met Josh.

33:54.032 --> 33:56.599
And this family,
your family,

33:56.599 --> 34:00.429
taught me that Blue Moon
was wrong.

34:00.429 --> 34:03.345
I did not take the journal, and
I would never hurt Caroline.

34:03.345 --> 34:04.346
Well, I don't believe you!

34:04.346 --> 34:07.175
Gavin, stop!

34:07.175 --> 34:08.394
He killed her.

34:08.394 --> 34:09.743
He killed her!

34:13.573 --> 34:14.922
No.

34:14.922 --> 34:16.054
No, Gavin,
I don't think he did.

34:16.054 --> 34:16.837
Silas is here.

34:16.837 --> 34:17.925
He's been shot.

34:17.925 --> 34:20.232
What?
By who?

34:20.232 --> 34:22.190
Kira.

34:28.370 --> 34:30.024
Close the gate!

34:30.024 --> 34:32.331
She's got Moore's journal!

34:45.257 --> 34:46.693
Let him go!

34:46.693 --> 34:48.477
Take another step
and I'll shoot him.

34:48.477 --> 34:51.132
Paara,
please, my love, stay there.

34:51.132 --> 34:54.135
I don't want you or
anyone else getting hurt.

34:54.135 --> 34:56.224
I'll be OK.

34:56.224 --> 34:58.400
I promise you.

35:02.752 --> 35:05.755
Get in the truck now.

35:30.737 --> 35:31.825
Are your scouts back yet?

35:31.825 --> 35:33.348
No.

35:33.348 --> 35:34.784
They're still tracking Kira.

35:34.784 --> 35:36.569
We are gonna do everything
we can to get Ty back.

35:38.440 --> 35:40.138
I'm sending my people
to a village south of here

35:40.138 --> 35:42.444
to gather more warriors.

35:42.444 --> 35:45.621
When we go after Ty,
we go with force.

36:19.916 --> 36:21.788
Hey.

36:26.662 --> 36:29.839
You know, when I was a kid,
I used to imagine meeting her.

36:29.839 --> 36:36.063
She'd take me for a drive,
and she'd tell me everything--

36:36.063 --> 36:41.851
her funny stories,
her favorite food.

36:41.851 --> 36:43.462
We never did any of that.

36:46.291 --> 36:48.771
I barely know
a thing about her.

36:52.819 --> 36:54.951
You know she loved you.

36:54.951 --> 36:57.650
That's all that really matters.

37:02.307 --> 37:03.786
What happened today?

37:06.441 --> 37:09.618
I thought we were
in this together.

37:09.618 --> 37:11.533
When Ty told us
about Blue Moon,

37:11.533 --> 37:14.188
I got really scared
for the kids.

37:14.188 --> 37:15.929
It was all I could think about.

37:15.929 --> 37:21.282
And then-- and then Levi came
to me and he wanted my help.

37:21.282 --> 37:23.589
So you considered it.

37:23.589 --> 37:25.286
Yeah, but just for a minute.

37:25.286 --> 37:29.508
And then I shut it down,
and I thought he did too.

37:29.508 --> 37:31.814
Yeah.

37:31.814 --> 37:34.208
Gavin, I made a mistake.

37:37.255 --> 37:41.520
You know, one way or another,
I feel like my entire life

37:41.520 --> 37:45.915
I've been fighting to put
my family back together.

37:45.915 --> 37:47.917
Please don't stop trying.

37:54.010 --> 37:55.316
Please.

38:05.935 --> 38:08.111
OK.

38:27.174 --> 38:29.176
How's he doing?

38:29.176 --> 38:31.309
Sam thinks he's gonna be OK.

38:32.222 --> 38:34.834
Want to tell me what this is?

38:34.834 --> 38:38.185
I asked Silas if he
knew Aaron, and he did.

38:38.185 --> 38:40.709
Silas said he worked
in the building.

38:40.709 --> 38:42.232
Holy crap.

38:42.232 --> 38:46.498
He was a computer engineer,
worked in the basement.

38:46.498 --> 38:49.196
He was like, nobody important.

38:49.196 --> 38:50.676
But he had the journal.

38:50.676 --> 38:54.375
Well, I think
he stole the journal.

38:54.375 --> 38:56.246
And he used the portal
to get to our time.

38:56.246 --> 38:58.858
Silas said that he would take
work from other scientists

38:58.858 --> 39:01.382
and try and pass it off
as his own, try to get noticed.

39:01.382 --> 39:03.428
Yeah, once a creep,
always a creep.

39:03.428 --> 39:06.822
He acted so smart,
so in control.

39:09.564 --> 39:12.611
Anyway, the computer
thing gave me an idea.

39:12.611 --> 39:14.177
Programming is all numbers.

39:14.177 --> 39:17.964
And Bible verses,
also numbers.

39:19.400 --> 39:21.054
If you write out just the
numbers of Aaron's Bible

39:21.054 --> 39:23.709
verses the way that he
put them in the journal,

39:23.709 --> 39:26.494
what does that look like
to you?

39:26.494 --> 39:27.713
Longitude and latitude.

39:27.713 --> 39:29.715
This is a map.

39:29.715 --> 39:34.415
What-- what do you
think it's for?

39:34.415 --> 39:36.069
I don't know.

39:36.069 --> 39:39.289
But I have a feeling it's gonna
help us get everyone home.

39:42.467 --> 39:44.425
I did it, Lucas.

39:44.425 --> 39:45.948
I beat him.

39:48.647 --> 39:50.779
Thanks for helping me.

40:02.225 --> 40:04.532
How are your children?

40:04.532 --> 40:05.794
They're hurting.

40:08.710 --> 40:11.713
We need to know more
about Kira.

40:11.713 --> 40:15.456
I have known her for years,
and I never saw this coming.

40:15.456 --> 40:17.763
But since both my guards
left with her,

40:17.763 --> 40:21.462
it's safe to assume
she's now in charge of Lazarus.

40:21.462 --> 40:23.551
She'll tell you it's
for altruistic reasons,

40:23.551 --> 40:26.946
but the truth is, she's
always wanted to be in power.

40:26.946 --> 40:28.817
Do you think there's any
way to reason with her?

40:28.817 --> 40:30.428
No.

40:30.428 --> 40:33.692
She sees everything outside
the project as a distraction.

40:33.692 --> 40:35.520
And given you tried
to destroy the machine,

40:35.520 --> 40:37.478
she'll never let you
near that building again.

40:39.959 --> 40:42.396
We need the machine
to save Eve's life.

40:42.396 --> 40:44.964
Well,
then it's a good thing I kept

40:44.964 --> 40:46.835
a few secrets from Kira.

40:46.835 --> 40:48.881
You have a way
into the building?

40:48.881 --> 40:50.404
I do.

40:50.404 --> 40:54.408
We can get back inside
together if you

40:54.408 --> 40:56.236
are willing to trust me.
