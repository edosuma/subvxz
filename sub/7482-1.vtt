00:01.116 --> 00:03.210
Previously on NCIS: Los Angeles:

00:03.384 --> 00:04.408
Janvier.

00:04.586 --> 00:07.317
- What are we gonna sell this year?
- A nuclear bomb.

00:07.489 --> 00:11.119
He took it off one joint at a time.

00:12.093 --> 00:13.151
Tracking device.

00:13.328 --> 00:14.420
Can't be removed.

00:14.596 --> 00:17.122
- The deal will be done.
- Very good.

00:19.801 --> 00:22.600
I have a daughter, 16 years old.
She lives in Paris.

00:22.770 --> 00:24.431
Bring me one
of the Russian women alive.

00:24.606 --> 00:28.770
Sidorov is going to kill
your beloved partner.

00:32.012 --> 00:34.345
- Is Quinn an agent?
- No.

00:44.626 --> 00:47.254
- Michelle!
- Aah!

00:47.795 --> 00:49.092
Kensi!

00:53.801 --> 00:55.462
Michelle!

00:55.637 --> 00:56.763
- Hang on!
- Aah!

01:47.589 --> 01:48.920
Go! Go!

02:49.417 --> 02:51.909
Hetty, I need an ambulance now.

03:15.143 --> 03:17.874
Twenty-eight-year-old female,
high-speed motorcycle crash victim.

03:18.046 --> 03:19.070
Helmeted, no LOC,

03:19.247 --> 03:21.272
multiple contusions
along neck and spine.

03:21.449 --> 03:23.941
Maya Yerzov,
former Russian special forces.

03:24.118 --> 03:26.485
- We know everything about you.
- Not now.

03:26.654 --> 03:30.090
BP 118/76, pulse 94,

03:30.258 --> 03:32.590
in full spinal immobilization
for mechanism.

03:32.760 --> 03:34.387
You're about to spend
your life in prison

03:34.562 --> 03:37.793
- unless you give us Sidorov's location.
- Back off.

03:37.965 --> 03:39.490
Does it meet trauma-center criteria?

03:39.667 --> 03:41.431
Any neurological deficits?

03:41.602 --> 03:43.127
Checking.

03:44.005 --> 03:47.805
Maya, we're gonna use this
to test your foot,

03:47.975 --> 03:50.501
so you tell me if this feels sharp,
okay?

03:50.678 --> 03:51.873
Okay.

03:56.250 --> 03:57.479
You feel that?

03:57.652 --> 03:59.313
No. No.

03:59.687 --> 04:02.054
Okay, let's try the other side.

04:02.223 --> 04:03.987
What about that?

04:04.492 --> 04:05.653
Anything?

04:05.960 --> 04:08.122
Uh, no.

04:08.296 --> 04:10.355
Am I paralyzed?

04:11.265 --> 04:13.893
We just have to get you
to the hospital quickly.

04:14.068 --> 04:16.332
Radio in.
We need a neurosurgeon to meet us,

04:16.504 --> 04:17.562
and have them hold an OR.

04:17.738 --> 04:19.332
No, no.

04:19.507 --> 04:20.997
Tell the driver to pull over.

04:21.175 --> 04:24.008
- What are you doing?
- Tell him to pull over. Now.

04:26.114 --> 04:27.809
Michael, pull over for a second.

04:27.982 --> 04:29.848
Copy that. What's up?

04:30.017 --> 04:31.041
Just pull over.

04:33.988 --> 04:36.650
If she doesn't get treatment
immediately, she will be paralyzed.

04:36.824 --> 04:38.815
There are two federal agents' lives
on the line.

04:39.727 --> 04:42.753
You tell me what Sidorov's location is
immediately.

04:43.364 --> 04:44.456
Oh, my God.

04:44.632 --> 04:47.795
You wanna spend the rest of your life
in a wheelchair? That what you want?

04:49.237 --> 04:51.171
Then tell me where he is.

04:54.041 --> 04:56.305
It's an auto body shop.

04:56.477 --> 04:58.673
East 14th and Elwood.

04:58.846 --> 05:01.577
- Eric, you got that?
- Checking.

05:02.984 --> 05:06.147
There is an auto body shop
at that location.

05:08.356 --> 05:10.916
Sidorov's Mercedes is parked in back.

05:11.759 --> 05:15.354
The good news is,
you're gonna be just fine.

05:17.899 --> 05:19.128
I felt that.

05:19.434 --> 05:21.698
The bad news is,

05:22.103 --> 05:24.367
this little piggy's going to prison.

05:27.542 --> 05:28.634
- Mr. Callen.
- Yes?

05:28.810 --> 05:30.778
We found Sidorov's location.

05:31.612 --> 05:32.773
Okay.

05:42.323 --> 05:44.155
You're gonna finish this deal.

05:44.325 --> 05:45.451
Or what?

05:45.626 --> 05:47.754
You're gonna punch me
in the face again?

05:47.929 --> 05:49.055
I'm thinking about it.

05:49.897 --> 05:54.801
If you send me out there,
it would give me a chance to escape.

05:54.969 --> 05:56.334
You'll be on a leash.

05:58.206 --> 06:02.165
Many a mad dog
has broken their leash, Agent Callen.

06:02.510 --> 06:04.376
Good luck with that.

06:05.413 --> 06:10.317
Call Sidorov, and then you call Vaziri,
set up a meet.

06:13.087 --> 06:15.852
And the game continues.

06:19.126 --> 06:24.326
Oh, by the way, have you recovered
Agent Hanna's body yet?

06:30.371 --> 06:32.703
Are you there, Agent Callen?

06:32.874 --> 06:36.242
I'm here. Watching and listening.

06:37.144 --> 06:40.603
It's a complicated relationship
we have.

06:40.781 --> 06:44.217
I consume you,
and you consume me.

06:44.719 --> 06:46.585
It's not complicated.

06:46.754 --> 06:48.188
It's obsessive.

06:48.356 --> 06:50.051
And sad.

06:51.559 --> 06:53.789
You might be right.

06:55.830 --> 06:58.697
You know that tracking spray
on your neck doesn't wash off.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.934
Oh, yes.

07:01.102 --> 07:02.797
My collar.

07:03.337 --> 07:05.305
Collars are for animals.

07:05.473 --> 07:07.271
Don't flatter yourself.

07:07.441 --> 07:08.465
They're here.

07:10.177 --> 07:12.077
Get close to them quickly.

07:13.981 --> 07:15.005
- Kens.
- Yes?

07:15.449 --> 07:17.349
- Go.
- Done.

07:44.111 --> 07:45.704
I got Sam.

07:45.880 --> 07:48.406
Deeks? Deeks, no.

07:49.317 --> 07:50.944
- Deeks?
- Oh, no.

07:51.118 --> 07:53.712
- Deeks? Hey.
- Sam?

07:55.056 --> 07:57.024
- Sam?
- Hey, it's me. It's me.

07:57.191 --> 07:58.659
- You...
- It's me.

07:58.826 --> 08:01.107
- You gotta get me out of here.
- Agent Hanna, look at me.

08:05.600 --> 08:06.897
Come on, Sam.

08:07.335 --> 08:09.235
You know who I am?

08:10.538 --> 08:11.972
Yeah.

08:12.373 --> 08:14.432
Kensi, the kit.

08:18.879 --> 08:20.404
You gotta cut me loose.

08:20.581 --> 08:23.016
We don't have much time, and I...
I can't.

08:23.184 --> 08:25.278
What...? What...? What are you...?

08:25.453 --> 08:26.978
What's happening?

08:27.154 --> 08:29.953
You have to stay here
just a while longer, okay?

08:30.124 --> 08:32.024
I'm sorry.

08:39.066 --> 08:40.124
- Kens.
- Go.

08:40.301 --> 08:42.133
Party's over. They're leaving.

08:54.482 --> 08:56.109
Isaak.

08:59.754 --> 09:02.485
You sent Barbies after me?

09:02.657 --> 09:03.920
I hate Barbies.

09:04.091 --> 09:06.287
I used to pull their heads off
when I was a kid.

09:07.895 --> 09:09.454
How did you find me?

09:09.764 --> 09:11.698
A Barbie told me.

09:11.866 --> 09:14.335
Right before I pulled her head off.

09:15.002 --> 09:17.164
Why'd you do it, Isaak?

09:18.639 --> 09:21.131
Your boyfriend is a federal agent.

09:24.145 --> 09:25.840
No, he isn't.

09:26.313 --> 09:28.714
Sadly, he is.

09:40.561 --> 09:42.051
Do you know this one?

09:44.265 --> 09:48.361
I saw this guy outside of a hotel once
where we were staying.

09:48.636 --> 09:50.934
I thought he was a cop.

09:51.405 --> 09:53.134
Who is he?

09:53.307 --> 09:55.173
Your boyfriend's handler.

09:56.477 --> 09:58.741
We don't know what agency.

09:58.913 --> 10:01.678
I had to make sure I could trust you.

10:26.040 --> 10:27.872
Who are you?

10:30.611 --> 10:33.376
Open your eyes
and tell me who you are.

10:34.815 --> 10:37.807
You did a hit
on Congressman Aquino.

10:40.988 --> 10:43.218
I was assigned to go undercover.

10:44.158 --> 10:46.456
Are you a federal agent?

10:49.864 --> 10:52.356
Are you a federal agent?

10:58.372 --> 10:59.771
FBI.

10:59.940 --> 11:01.601
All right, listen.

11:02.610 --> 11:05.011
You let us walk out of here,

11:05.279 --> 11:06.747
and you guys walk out of here.

11:06.914 --> 11:08.575
Nobody even knows we're here.

11:09.450 --> 11:11.714
You kill a federal agent,
you're as good as dead.

11:13.954 --> 11:15.581
No. No.

11:23.931 --> 11:26.798
Remember, Isaak,
he said he loved me too.

11:33.073 --> 11:34.666
I understand.

11:35.142 --> 11:36.610
Good.

11:38.012 --> 11:40.106
Let's get out of here
and make some money.

12:02.635 --> 12:04.296
Come on. Let's go.

12:05.705 --> 12:08.003
All right, there's one over here
and another in there.

12:08.174 --> 12:10.165
Quickly. Come on.

12:11.845 --> 12:13.836
Paramedics are here.

12:14.180 --> 12:16.512
We'll get you out of here, Sam.

12:17.016 --> 12:18.848
Open your mouth. Open.

12:19.018 --> 12:20.679
You were electrocuted?

12:21.154 --> 12:22.883
It's okay, Sam.

12:23.656 --> 12:26.182
Yeah,
he's got multiple dental trauma.

12:26.359 --> 12:29.954
A possible fractured mandible.
He's gonna need an oral surgeon.

12:30.129 --> 12:32.461
Whoa. Whoa, whoa. Hold on, hold on.

12:32.632 --> 12:33.793
Sam, sit down.

12:33.967 --> 12:34.991
Deeks.

12:36.169 --> 12:37.728
Did you give up Michelle?

12:39.138 --> 12:40.196
No.

12:40.373 --> 12:42.671
Was Sidorov playing her just now?

12:44.711 --> 12:46.543
I didn't give her up.

12:47.580 --> 12:48.741
I didn't give her up.

12:48.915 --> 12:52.374
All right, Sam. You need
to let the paramedics do their job.

12:52.785 --> 12:54.253
Thank you.

12:55.255 --> 12:56.347
Pulse is 120.

12:59.325 --> 13:00.815
Trauma team to ER, stat.

13:00.994 --> 13:03.224
Still hypertensive after 500 cc's.

13:03.396 --> 13:05.626
Two beds open in Trauma 1.

13:07.166 --> 13:09.066
Four units O-neg
ready if you need them.

13:09.235 --> 13:11.465
Anesthesia standing by.

13:12.739 --> 13:15.640
Start 75 cc's of blood.

13:15.808 --> 13:18.243
- Let's get him on the sheet.
- I got the LINPAC.

13:18.411 --> 13:20.175
- Line's clear.
- Spike another liter.

13:20.346 --> 13:22.144
Are we ready? Lift on three.

13:22.315 --> 13:25.341
- One, two, three.
- Aah!

13:25.518 --> 13:27.885
Three liters of saline.
Four migs of morphine.

13:28.054 --> 13:29.414
Send a troponin
to check for damage

13:29.555 --> 13:31.455
and a CK for rhabdo
and kidney failure.

13:33.026 --> 13:35.586
I'm Dr. Garcia.
I need to look inside your mouth.

13:36.329 --> 13:37.421
No.

13:37.597 --> 13:40.066
Detective, I need you
to open your mouth.

13:40.233 --> 13:41.928
Can you hear me?

13:42.101 --> 13:45.298
You swallowed a lot of blood.
Please open your mouth.

13:46.539 --> 13:47.699
I'm gonna need to sedate him.

13:47.840 --> 13:49.706
Back off. Give him a minute.

13:52.145 --> 13:55.274
Deeks, you've got to listen
to the doctor.

13:56.182 --> 13:57.206
Deeks.

13:59.552 --> 14:01.145
- Deeks.
- Come on, Agent Blye.

14:01.321 --> 14:02.345
We've got work to do.

14:26.846 --> 14:29.144
- This the exchange site?
- Yeah.

14:29.315 --> 14:31.841
Janvier's on the top level
of the garage.

14:32.018 --> 14:33.281
Sidorov and Vaziri are late.

14:33.453 --> 14:35.148
- They get spooked?
- I'm not sure.

14:35.321 --> 14:38.086
There was a lot of talk at the meet
I couldn't hear.

14:38.791 --> 14:41.658
- How are they?
- Not good.

14:42.128 --> 14:43.425
It was pretty brutal.

14:43.963 --> 14:46.159
Deeks won't even look at me.

14:47.300 --> 14:48.324
My fault.

14:48.501 --> 14:50.993
It was simply the cost
of completing this mission.

14:51.170 --> 14:52.638
Yeah, then the cost is too high.

14:52.805 --> 14:54.899
Two nuclear weapons
mean thousands of innocent lives.

14:55.074 --> 14:57.099
I know what the math is.

14:58.978 --> 15:01.140
I run it through my head
every few minutes.

15:01.314 --> 15:02.782
Yeah.

15:04.150 --> 15:05.675
Sodol.

15:13.292 --> 15:15.522
Everybody's here.

15:15.695 --> 15:17.754
The minute they mention
the location of the bombs,

15:17.930 --> 15:19.989
we move in and this ends.

15:20.166 --> 15:22.294
Professionally,
they're all armed and dangerous.

15:22.468 --> 15:24.994
Proceed with extreme caution.

15:25.905 --> 15:31.309
Personally, I don't need any of them
to spend another day on this Earth.

15:36.082 --> 15:38.483
Here we go. Get ready to move.

15:38.651 --> 15:40.085
I'm going to check the gold.

15:40.253 --> 15:41.914
It's all there.

15:42.722 --> 15:44.816
We count it just the same.

15:45.324 --> 15:47.656
We aren't gonna cheat you.

15:48.161 --> 15:52.530
It's a small price to pay
to make Iran a nuclear power.

15:54.467 --> 15:59.598
And for you, my friend,
$2 million in Dutch bearer bonds.

15:59.772 --> 16:01.433
They're untraceable, like cash.

16:01.607 --> 16:03.200
Come on,
tell us where the bombs are.

16:03.776 --> 16:05.642
It's all here.

16:05.978 --> 16:08.037
Pleasure doing business with you.

16:08.748 --> 16:10.739
Too bad it won't buy you a hand.

16:12.018 --> 16:13.611
I'll see you in hell.

16:14.220 --> 16:15.710
Maybe sooner.

16:18.458 --> 16:20.392
We have a deal.

16:20.560 --> 16:23.689
When this is done,
you leave me alone.

16:24.397 --> 16:27.128
I never go back on my word.

16:33.406 --> 16:35.704
- Yes?
- How'd they look?

16:35.875 --> 16:37.900
Everything is checked.
It's on its way.

16:38.077 --> 16:39.704
Okay.

16:43.783 --> 16:47.742
The merchandise was checked
and it's being taken to the ship.

16:49.989 --> 16:51.389
Bombs are being delivered
to a ship?

16:51.691 --> 16:53.216
We can't bust them
till we know where.

16:53.526 --> 16:55.790
We have to stay with them.
I'll take Vaziri.

16:55.962 --> 16:59.455
- I'll take Michelle and Sidorov.
- Eric, Nell, find that ship fast.

17:04.103 --> 17:05.537
Okay, to avoid sanctions,

17:05.704 --> 17:09.368
Iran sails ships
under flags of Zanzibar, Moldova...

17:09.541 --> 17:12.382
See if there were any large trucks
near the auto body shop that match...

17:12.512 --> 17:14.173
Any of the local ports.

17:16.781 --> 17:20.082
Callen,
Janvier is not moving towards you.

17:20.252 --> 17:22.619
- He went into the mall.
- What?

17:22.788 --> 17:25.189
You still have
his Overwatch signature?

17:25.358 --> 17:27.520
Yeah. The mall has skylights.
I'm tracking him.

17:27.827 --> 17:29.124
He's moving to the north end.

17:37.136 --> 17:39.332
He's gone down the escalator.
He's on the first level.

17:50.683 --> 17:53.948
All right, he's leaving the main area.
It looks like a maintenance area.

17:55.388 --> 17:59.120
Uh, I lost his Overwatch signature, but I
still have the button cam on his jacket.

17:59.292 --> 18:00.350
Which way, Eric?

18:00.693 --> 18:02.821
Go to your left. You should see a door
to maintenance.

18:04.096 --> 18:07.691
It leads to a hallway behind the stores
that runs the length of the mall.

18:25.718 --> 18:26.742
Oh, no.

18:26.919 --> 18:29.013
Callen, Janvier just killed somebody.

18:29.889 --> 18:32.756
He stole his ID and a phone.

18:33.025 --> 18:34.652
He can't get away.

18:39.699 --> 18:41.030
What is he trying to do?

18:47.640 --> 18:49.039
We've lost visual contact.

18:50.676 --> 18:52.337
Still no Overwatch?

18:54.113 --> 18:55.512
Eric, talk to me.

18:55.681 --> 18:59.174
Uh... All right, I got him.
He's moving back into the mall.

19:02.922 --> 19:06.085
Okay, I'll try to locate him
on the security cameras.

19:16.235 --> 19:18.533
Callen, he's dressed
as a maintenance worker.

19:18.704 --> 19:21.105
Overalls and a cap.
Just past the food court.

19:21.274 --> 19:22.901
On my way.

19:25.111 --> 19:26.203
Lost visual.

19:26.379 --> 19:29.576
Overwatch says he's just north,
heading toward the end of the wing.

19:33.119 --> 19:36.020
- He's running.
- No, he's not. He's on a cart.

19:36.188 --> 19:37.656
He's headed for the north exit.

19:38.291 --> 19:39.315
Got him.

19:51.304 --> 19:52.931
It's not him.

19:53.239 --> 19:55.435
Overwatch signature
says he's right in front of you.

19:55.608 --> 19:58.339
- What did he do?
- I don't know.

20:15.161 --> 20:16.822
He cut off his Overwatch spray.

20:17.296 --> 20:19.924
He cut the skin off his own body?

20:21.133 --> 20:23.363
And now he's untraceable.

21:12.484 --> 21:15.419
- Yes.
- Where's Michelle?

21:16.421 --> 21:17.855
She's with Sidorov.

21:20.358 --> 21:21.848
Why didn't you pull her out?

21:22.026 --> 21:25.690
We believe the nuclear devices
are onboard a ship

21:25.864 --> 21:27.855
possibly bound for Iran.

21:28.032 --> 21:30.763
- But you don't know which one?
- No.

21:30.935 --> 21:35.930
She's staying in to see if Sidorov
knows anything about the ship.

21:36.107 --> 21:37.575
Where are they?

21:37.742 --> 21:40.643
Agent Hanna,
you were severely injured.

21:40.812 --> 21:44.248
I'm ordering you
to remain in the hospital.

21:48.920 --> 21:50.115
Miss Blye.

21:50.288 --> 21:52.347
- Yeah, Hetty.
- Status?

21:52.524 --> 21:55.186
Sidorov, Andros and Michelle
are in the Camford Hotel.

21:55.360 --> 21:57.727
Agent Hanna will be calling you.

21:57.896 --> 22:00.797
Do not give him your location.

22:00.965 --> 22:03.457
It's for his own good.

22:05.103 --> 22:06.935
Anything on the ship?

22:07.105 --> 22:09.506
The Port of Los Angeles
is the busiest in the country.

22:09.674 --> 22:11.802
Eight million containers
move through there a year.

22:11.976 --> 22:13.603
Not to mention
the Port of Long Beach.

22:13.912 --> 22:16.279
- Granger with Vaziri?
- Yes.

22:16.448 --> 22:18.348
You wanna bring Vaziri in,
question him?

22:18.516 --> 22:21.076
He has diplomatic immunity.
We wouldn't be able to keep him long.

22:21.219 --> 22:23.085
And he'll never admit
to buying the weapons.

22:23.254 --> 22:25.450
Let alone give us
the name of the ship.

22:25.623 --> 22:27.591
What's the last location we have
on Janvier?

22:27.759 --> 22:30.854
Uh, he left the mall on foot,
but we lost him after that.

22:31.029 --> 22:33.123
We have a BOLO out
and facial recognition

22:33.298 --> 22:35.767
running at the borders
and international airports.

22:35.934 --> 22:38.369
We need to stay focused
on the bombs.

22:38.536 --> 22:40.800
Janvier is obsessed with you.

22:40.972 --> 22:43.873
It might be wise
not to be obsessed with him.

22:44.042 --> 22:45.669
I have to be.

22:45.844 --> 22:47.209
Janvier's a threat.

22:47.378 --> 22:49.142
He lives for revenge.

22:49.647 --> 22:51.308
He'll come after me.

22:51.483 --> 22:54.453
Or any agent I'm connected to.

23:17.442 --> 23:21.003
I owe you for the rest of my life
for what you did for me.

23:27.619 --> 23:29.815
I just wanted you to know.

23:31.589 --> 23:33.318
I think I'm, uh...

23:34.125 --> 23:36.685
I think I'm done being a cop.

23:40.798 --> 23:43.267
That would be a huge mistake.

23:46.704 --> 23:48.331
You're a great cop.

23:50.008 --> 23:51.533
You're gonna make a great agent.

23:57.248 --> 23:59.683
I never thought I'd hear that
coming from you.

24:00.952 --> 24:03.250
Yeah, that was my mistake.

24:08.493 --> 24:10.552
I won't make it again.

24:40.959 --> 24:46.329
1982 Chateau Bel Orme Tronquoy
de Lalande.

24:46.998 --> 24:48.898
I've waited years to open this.

24:49.067 --> 24:51.399
Now...

24:53.304 --> 24:54.965
Now you're done waiting.

24:55.139 --> 24:57.005
- Very much.
- Hm.

25:22.233 --> 25:23.291
I need a minute.

25:27.505 --> 25:29.337
Just one minute.

25:32.744 --> 25:34.678
I'll be back.

25:52.897 --> 25:54.456
Who's this?

25:56.434 --> 25:57.924
Hello?

26:01.506 --> 26:04.635
I got a call from the Camford Hotel.
That's where Michelle and Kensi are.

26:09.947 --> 26:12.973
- It's a text.
- That's gotta be from Michelle.

26:13.151 --> 26:14.641
Get everything you can
off that phone.

26:14.819 --> 26:15.980
Just give me a minute.

26:18.022 --> 26:20.457
I don't like being teased, Quinn.

26:20.825 --> 26:22.953
You don't want me
breaking down the door.

26:23.127 --> 26:25.186
Just a sec.

26:28.332 --> 26:31.358
You are supposed to be
in a hospital.

26:31.536 --> 26:32.856
Do you know what room they're in?

26:33.004 --> 26:35.234
Michelle got Sidorov's phone.
Eric's downloading it now.

26:35.606 --> 26:38.268
I asked you,
do you know what room she's in?

26:38.443 --> 26:39.467
No.

26:39.644 --> 26:41.976
You better promise me
Hetty will never know you were here.

26:42.447 --> 26:45.542
Something tells me
that's gonna be impossible.

26:46.150 --> 26:48.847
I just got a hit for a plane ticket
purchased for an...

26:49.020 --> 26:51.717
- Adeline Janvier.
- Janvier's daughter.

26:51.889 --> 26:54.085
The ticket is from Las Vegas
to Los Angeles.

26:54.258 --> 26:55.555
Flight landed ten minutes ago.

26:55.727 --> 26:57.247
Las Vegas?
I thought Janvier's daughter

26:57.395 --> 26:58.988
- was in Paris.
- She was.

26:59.163 --> 27:01.188
I got everything off Sidorov's phone.

27:05.670 --> 27:07.900
I'm waiting, Quinn.

27:08.072 --> 27:10.040
Coming.

27:30.027 --> 27:32.086
You bit me.

27:32.497 --> 27:33.965
Did it hurt?

27:35.266 --> 27:36.427
Yes.

27:38.636 --> 27:41.537
That's only the beginning.

27:44.041 --> 27:46.567
Where is my phone, Quinn?

27:47.245 --> 27:49.543
But then I guess
Quinn isn't your real name.

27:52.884 --> 27:53.942
Andros!

27:55.286 --> 27:57.118
I found an address of the port.
Big screen.

27:57.288 --> 27:58.768
Gotta be the dock
where the bombs are.

27:58.923 --> 28:00.584
Or were.

28:02.326 --> 28:03.885
I want Michelle out now.

28:04.562 --> 28:08.089
- Could be one of a half dozen ships.
- I don't give a damn. We'll find it.

28:08.266 --> 28:10.894
Have Homeland Security
lock down the dock,

28:11.068 --> 28:12.399
and alert the NEST team.

28:12.570 --> 28:13.833
Yeah.

28:14.672 --> 28:15.764
Mr. Hanna?

28:15.940 --> 28:16.998
Yes, Hetty.

28:17.175 --> 28:18.472
How did she know you were here?

28:18.743 --> 28:20.643
That's a discussion for another day.

28:20.812 --> 28:22.302
Get Michelle out now.

28:22.480 --> 28:23.606
With pleasure.

28:27.985 --> 28:29.953
Federal agent.
We need to know what room he's in,

28:30.121 --> 28:31.247
and we need a key fast.

28:31.722 --> 28:33.053
I checked him in.

28:33.224 --> 28:34.453
Room 1504.

28:34.725 --> 28:36.250
Thank you.

28:47.171 --> 28:48.969
Federal agents!

28:55.279 --> 28:56.872
They're gone.

29:13.663 --> 29:15.290
Eric, what are you seeing?

29:15.465 --> 29:17.593
They've disabled the camera
outside the room,

29:17.767 --> 29:19.207
and they're not on any
other cameras.

29:19.369 --> 29:20.962
I'm looking at the lobby,
the garage...

29:21.137 --> 29:23.196
What about traffic cameras
surrounding the hotel?

29:23.373 --> 29:24.568
Searching.

29:25.809 --> 29:28.835
Sidorov found a way out. Find it.

29:30.213 --> 29:34.207
This is the woman from Las Vegas
flying under the name Adeline Janvier.

29:34.384 --> 29:37.285
And this is actually Adeline Janvier.

29:37.454 --> 29:38.649
It's not the same woman.

29:38.822 --> 29:41.792
Then why is she flying
under Janvier's daughter's name?

29:41.958 --> 29:43.448
Almost like he wants us to find her.

29:43.927 --> 29:46.021
Bait, perhaps?

29:46.930 --> 29:48.921
Okay, I found the woman
from Las Vegas

29:49.099 --> 29:52.433
getting in a cab at LAX
a half hour ago.

29:52.602 --> 29:54.969
Find out who she is
and where she went.

29:55.305 --> 29:57.205
That's what Janvier
would want us to do.

29:57.707 --> 30:01.041
Sam, I just got a hit for a private plane
chartered out of LAX,

30:01.211 --> 30:03.145
booked under one
of Sidorov's companies.

30:03.313 --> 30:04.712
Takes off in 15 minutes.

30:04.881 --> 30:08.215
Alert Homeland Security at LAX.
That plane does not take off.

30:08.384 --> 30:09.852
Hold on. I got another hit

30:10.019 --> 30:11.779
for a private jet
out of the Ontario airport.

30:11.921 --> 30:13.116
And another one from Burbank.

30:13.289 --> 30:15.087
Another one for John Wayne.

30:15.258 --> 30:17.989
- What is he doing?
- Hedging his bets?

30:18.161 --> 30:20.596
We stop one, he's not gonna be able
to get to the other one.

30:20.930 --> 30:22.898
There's one more for San Diego.

30:23.433 --> 30:24.559
That's two hours away.

30:24.734 --> 30:26.429
Where do you wanna go?

30:27.103 --> 30:30.562
I... I don't know,
but, Eric, none of those flights take off.

30:36.246 --> 30:39.443
Just tracked Vaziri
to an apartment in Hollywood.

30:39.616 --> 30:41.277
We any closer
on the ship with the bombs?

30:41.451 --> 30:43.351
We believe we found the dock,

30:43.520 --> 30:45.045
and the NEST team
has been dispatched

30:45.221 --> 30:46.848
to the Port of Los Angeles.

30:47.023 --> 30:49.082
As soon as you find the bombs,
I'll take him in.

30:50.960 --> 30:52.519
Okay, the woman from Las Vegas

30:52.695 --> 30:56.529
traveling under Janvier's
daughter's name is Kayla Bishop.

30:56.699 --> 31:01.796
She's an exotic dancer with convictions
for fraud, theft and prostitution.

31:01.971 --> 31:05.373
Janvier likes to hire small-time crooks
that wanna make some quick cash.

31:05.542 --> 31:07.670
The question is why?

31:08.044 --> 31:09.671
The charter company
just texted the pilot

31:09.846 --> 31:11.871
to expect the passengers
in less than an hour.

31:12.048 --> 31:14.847
- Where? LAX?
- No. San Diego.

31:15.118 --> 31:17.815
But that doesn't make any sense.
He can't get down there that fast.

31:23.193 --> 31:25.662
- Sidorov never left the hotel.
- What are you talking about?

31:26.095 --> 31:28.587
Eric, check the roof
of the Camford Hotel for a helipad.

31:28.765 --> 31:29.960
It's got one.

31:30.133 --> 31:32.329
And there's a bunch of suitcases.

31:33.636 --> 31:34.660
It's the gold.

31:34.837 --> 31:36.236
They gotta be there somewhere.

31:36.673 --> 31:38.300
There's a helicopter inbound.

31:43.179 --> 31:44.874
The chopper's two minutes out.

31:45.048 --> 31:46.982
Sam, we got them.
They're on the helipad.

31:54.924 --> 31:56.414
Federal agents!
Drop your weapons!

31:59.696 --> 32:01.323
Eric, get that chopper out of here.

32:01.764 --> 32:03.163
Lower your weapons.

32:03.933 --> 32:05.367
Where you gonna go?

32:05.535 --> 32:06.900
It's over.

32:11.374 --> 32:13.706
Looks like you lost your ride.

32:14.310 --> 32:16.244
Lower your guns
and get away from the door.

32:16.512 --> 32:17.536
Not happening.

32:17.714 --> 32:19.739
Yes, it is. You know why?

32:20.350 --> 32:22.842
Because your love for her
is your weakness.

32:23.019 --> 32:24.646
I could say the same for you.

32:24.821 --> 32:26.721
The difference is,
I'm willing to kill her,

32:26.889 --> 32:29.187
but you are only willing
to die for her.

32:29.726 --> 32:31.285
In a New York second.

32:31.995 --> 32:34.054
Do I have to put a bullet
in her shoulder?

32:34.731 --> 32:36.665
Lower your weapons
and get away from the door.

32:36.833 --> 32:38.301
Don't do it, Sam. Shoot him.

32:39.936 --> 32:40.960
Last chance.

32:41.504 --> 32:43.802
Okay. Okay.

32:43.973 --> 32:45.304
You win.

32:46.042 --> 32:47.942
Do what he says.

32:48.111 --> 32:49.306
Move!

32:51.381 --> 32:52.815
Don't hurt her.

32:56.119 --> 32:57.780
Don't hurt her.

32:59.222 --> 33:00.246
Okay.

33:02.325 --> 33:03.815
Go.

33:27.350 --> 33:29.182
Cut these.

33:34.090 --> 33:36.684
Deeks, are you okay? Wha...?

33:37.327 --> 33:38.761
No, I'm good.

33:41.230 --> 33:42.823
You good?

33:43.132 --> 33:45.260
Yeah, I'm good.

34:06.054 --> 34:08.955
The NEST team
is at the Port of Los Angeles, Dock 23.

34:09.123 --> 34:11.388
They're scanning the containers
for radiation signatures.

34:11.827 --> 34:14.387
Okay, using the license plate
from the taxi,

34:14.563 --> 34:17.054
I've tracked the woman
posing as Janvier's daughter

34:17.232 --> 34:19.098
to an apartment in Hollywood.

34:19.266 --> 34:21.463
That's the apartment
Granger tracked Vaziri to.

34:21.770 --> 34:25.797
According to the cab's records,
she got there just before Granger.

34:27.641 --> 34:29.402
Make sure Granger knows
Janvier may be there,

34:29.543 --> 34:30.978
and tell him to wait for me.

34:31.146 --> 34:33.513
Surely it's a trap, Mr. Callen.

34:35.217 --> 34:36.878
I know.

34:50.098 --> 34:51.690
Janvier?

34:51.867 --> 34:54.699
I haven't seen him.
He could've come in through the back.

34:56.170 --> 34:57.661
Let's finish this.

34:57.839 --> 34:59.170
Ground rules.

34:59.775 --> 35:01.937
If Janvier wants to die
by suicide-by-cop...

35:02.110 --> 35:03.190
I have no interest in that.

35:03.345 --> 35:05.370
I'm just saying,

35:05.580 --> 35:07.912
let's be clean about it.

35:08.750 --> 35:10.684
As a whistle.

35:23.632 --> 35:25.031
Go.

35:27.068 --> 35:28.365
Federal agents!

35:32.474 --> 35:33.964
Vaziri's men.

36:06.107 --> 36:08.576
This wasn't a trap for us.

36:09.110 --> 36:12.341
He used the girl to lure Vaziri.

36:12.514 --> 36:15.677
Vaziri cut off Janvier's hand.

36:15.851 --> 36:19.446
Janvier cuts off
both of his in return.

36:21.656 --> 36:24.125
He didn't care about getting away.

36:24.993 --> 36:26.518
It's all about revenge.

36:29.097 --> 36:30.861
He's alive.

36:33.468 --> 36:35.698
Balcony.

36:36.505 --> 36:38.269
Balcony.

36:44.312 --> 36:46.371
You looking for the guy
who just jumped off there?

36:46.848 --> 36:49.647
- Where did he go?
- Down the street.

36:49.818 --> 36:51.718
He got into the black Beemer.

37:22.918 --> 37:24.147
Finish it.

37:25.954 --> 37:27.718
We both want it.

37:42.771 --> 37:44.364
Hey.

37:45.407 --> 37:49.810
Hey.
They, uh, recover the bombs?

37:49.978 --> 37:52.106
Yeah. NEST team found them

37:52.280 --> 37:55.341
hidden in a container
headed for Iran via Africa.

37:55.517 --> 37:57.576
They're securing them now.

37:58.086 --> 38:00.612
Well, I love happy endings.

38:02.691 --> 38:04.090
What are you doing?

38:08.263 --> 38:10.925
I don't know. I was just, uh...

38:11.232 --> 38:14.167
I was just cleaning some stuff out,
but I don't...

38:15.003 --> 38:16.732
I don't know.

38:16.905 --> 38:18.100
Yeah.

38:20.709 --> 38:24.077
- I know what you're going through...
- I really hope that you never do.

38:26.715 --> 38:28.149
Right.

38:30.085 --> 38:34.022
But if you wanna talk about it,
or not talk at all,

38:34.456 --> 38:35.480
I'm here for you.

38:35.657 --> 38:37.887
I just... I wanna walk away from it.

38:38.059 --> 38:39.549
Yeah, so take some time off.

38:39.728 --> 38:42.993
I need to get away from everything,
you know? I just, like... I just...

38:47.302 --> 38:49.396
And everyone?

38:55.343 --> 38:56.936
Okay.

39:03.551 --> 39:04.575
- Kens.
- Yeah?

39:04.753 --> 39:08.155
Ahem. Hey, I just want you to know
that the place I went to in my head

39:09.324 --> 39:13.693
to, uh, stop the pain

39:14.863 --> 39:16.160
was you.

39:18.733 --> 39:23.261
I just kept thinking about your smile

39:24.873 --> 39:26.932
and your laugh.

39:32.013 --> 39:33.845
Everything.

39:41.990 --> 39:44.425
It's the only thing
that got me through.

39:46.728 --> 39:48.389
For whatever it's worth.

39:52.033 --> 39:54.297
- I'll be home really early.
- Great.

39:54.903 --> 39:57.929
- I love you.
- I love you, baby.

39:58.173 --> 40:00.540
Michelle going back
to being Mrs. Sam Hanna?

40:00.709 --> 40:02.629
Ah, she's helping our daughter
with her homework.

40:02.777 --> 40:06.304
- Mm-hm. How long is that gonna last?
- I don't know.

40:06.948 --> 40:10.077
Deeks, got you a present.

40:17.926 --> 40:19.690
Wow, that is, um...

40:23.164 --> 40:24.427
What?

40:24.599 --> 40:25.828
Too soon?

40:26.101 --> 40:28.365
It might be a little too soon.

40:28.536 --> 40:29.935
So then this isn't cool?

40:31.439 --> 40:34.238
- No?
- Ha-ha-ha-ha.

40:34.409 --> 40:36.878
That's... No, that's amazing actually.

40:37.045 --> 40:39.139
- All right.
- Yes.

40:41.015 --> 40:44.349
Hey. Laughing's good.

40:46.287 --> 40:47.686
Yeah.

40:48.156 --> 40:49.555
Okay.

40:50.759 --> 40:52.284
Let's get out of here.

40:52.460 --> 40:54.155
Drinks are on me.

40:57.465 --> 40:58.830
Nothing cold.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.593
Or warm.

41:00.769 --> 41:01.793
Or chewy.

41:30.865 --> 41:34.495
Eight feet wide, 11 feet long.

41:35.103 --> 41:37.800
Twenty-three-hour-a-day lockdown.

41:37.972 --> 41:40.805
Triple life sentence.

41:41.309 --> 41:42.799
Priceless.

41:44.012 --> 41:47.642
I didn't think I would see you again.

41:48.683 --> 41:51.948
I just had to see this
with my own eyes.

41:58.293 --> 42:04.630
Two-hour plane flight
just to see me step into a cell.

42:06.701 --> 42:10.001
Not much going on at home,
I guess.

42:22.283 --> 42:26.379
Did you ever read
The Count of Monte Cristo?

42:30.725 --> 42:35.720
It's the story of a man
who spent 21 years in prison,

42:36.097 --> 42:39.692
only to escape
and exact his revenge.

42:54.649 --> 42:56.413
Agent G. Callen.

42:59.187 --> 43:02.452
The game is not over.
