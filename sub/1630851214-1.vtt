01:32.871 --> 01:34.638
The coast is clear, Chief.

01:38.944 --> 01:41.612
Give the agent the go ahead,
Miss James.

01:49.820 --> 01:52.991
Okay, Sam, you heard the Chief.
Mission's a go.

02:20.551 --> 02:23.955
Coast is still clear,
but the window of opportunity is closing.

02:23.989 --> 02:26.724
We're five by five,
but time is of the essence.

02:26.757 --> 02:28.625
I'm going as fast as I can.

02:28.659 --> 02:30.895
<i>We'll be
monitoring you the whole time.</i>

02:36.800 --> 02:40.704
Yes! The crowd cheers as he
totally sticks the landing.

02:41.873 --> 02:43.540
Don't leave me hanging.

02:43.574 --> 02:47.979
Miss James, please.
This is a serious mission.

02:48.013 --> 02:49.047
Sorry, Chief.

02:50.048 --> 02:51.149
Nice landing.

02:51.182 --> 02:52.750
You earned a banana
for that one.

02:52.783 --> 02:55.086
Mmm.

03:45.203 --> 03:46.371
<i>According to the blueprints,</i>

03:46.404 --> 03:47.939
<i>you need to move straight ahead</i>

03:47.972 --> 03:49.640
<i>until you come to a T.</i>

04:04.956 --> 04:07.926
<i>Okay, tough guy,
stay on mission.</i>

04:20.105 --> 04:23.707
If our info's correct,
you should find an accessible data port

04:23.740 --> 04:25.809
<i>at the tower
closest to the door.</i>

04:27.145 --> 04:30.048
Tell him it's imperative
we have that data.

04:30.081 --> 04:33.817
He knows, Chief,
we've trained for the situation.

04:33.852 --> 04:37.155
The future of our democracy
may depend on it.

04:55.772 --> 04:58.842
Take five
and let me work my magic.

04:59.843 --> 05:00.879
Hm.

05:02.313 --> 05:03.982
<i>We're in business,</i>

05:04.015 --> 05:06.184
<i>sit tight and we'll have you
out of there in no time.</i>

05:06.217 --> 05:07.784
Hm?

05:22.967 --> 05:25.736
What on earth are you doing here?

05:27.038 --> 05:27.906
We got it.

05:27.939 --> 05:29.806
Grab that drive
and get out of there.

05:29.840 --> 05:31.442
How did you get in here?

05:31.476 --> 05:33.278
Zip line grappling hooks,
snuck by the guards

05:33.311 --> 05:35.380
- and through the ventilation shaft
- A talking ape?

05:35.413 --> 05:36.948
I prefer chimp.

05:42.487 --> 05:43.421
Monkey?

05:46.024 --> 05:47.392
Get him!

05:56.767 --> 05:58.469
We've been breached!

05:58.503 --> 06:01.738
Lock it down, lock it down!

06:22.093 --> 06:26.898
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

06:47.986 --> 06:49.053
Freeze!

06:49.087 --> 06:51.022
Um, a little help.

06:58.263 --> 07:00.565
Silly bad guys,

07:00.598 --> 07:03.167
you can't have a lock down
when there's a fire alarm.

07:03.201 --> 07:04.801
Everybody knows that.

07:54.552 --> 07:57.488
Who was that funky monkey?

10:10.521 --> 10:13.624
So how'd you
get into this line of work?

10:13.658 --> 10:15.693
I got recruited, just like you.

10:16.694 --> 10:18.362
No, but, I mean,

10:18.396 --> 10:21.165
you-you know, have you always
wanted to work with a monkey?

10:21.199 --> 10:24.001
He's not a monkey,
he's a chimpanzee,

10:24.035 --> 10:26.571
a member of
the great ape species.

10:26.604 --> 10:28.372
And he hates
being called a monkey.

10:28.406 --> 10:30.575
Oh, my bad.

10:30.608 --> 10:32.009
I hate it, too.

10:32.043 --> 10:35.279
Oh, uh, I... of course.

10:35.313 --> 10:37.281
And, I mean, I totally agree
with you, you know?

10:37.315 --> 10:39.317
And-and I do, you know,
it's just I thought

10:39.350 --> 10:41.786
it was kind of funny
because, you know.

10:41.819 --> 10:45.423
No, I don't.
It's funny why?

10:47.625 --> 10:50.428
Sam, buddy, you really got
some moves out there.

10:57.635 --> 10:58.703
I'd like to thank you both

10:58.736 --> 11:00.137
for attending this little

11:00.171 --> 11:02.707
team-building exercise today.

11:02.740 --> 11:04.075
Happy to be on the team, Chief.

11:04.108 --> 11:05.409
Yeah, happy to be here.

11:06.410 --> 11:07.645
Camaraderie is important

11:07.678 --> 11:10.381
for any well-oiled organization

11:10.414 --> 11:13.684
as it is maintaining an appropriate
level of physical training.

11:34.438 --> 11:38.576
He appears to have developed
a bit of a fan club.

11:38.609 --> 11:42.280
Bit unseemly for a secret agent.

11:42.313 --> 11:44.115
We got to go.
Dad's here.

11:44.148 --> 11:47.818
Oh, okay. Um, it was nice
hanging out with you.

11:47.853 --> 11:49.353
Outside of work, I mean.

11:49.387 --> 11:51.088
Sure, you bet.

12:15.580 --> 12:17.381
Did you have fun
with your friends today?

12:17.415 --> 12:20.751
They're not friends, Dad,
they're co-workers.

12:20.785 --> 12:22.820
You and Sam are friends
and co-workers, right?

12:22.854 --> 12:25.256
Yeah, but that's different.

12:25.289 --> 12:26.858
Sam and I are family.

12:26.892 --> 12:29.460
Hm, family's
important to you, huh?

12:29.493 --> 12:31.228
It's not to you?

12:31.262 --> 12:33.497
Sweetie, about that.

12:33.531 --> 12:35.433
I know you're not very happy
with me these days,

12:35.466 --> 12:38.769
but your mother and I can't
have you doing what you did.

12:40.872 --> 12:43.341
I don't know
what you're talking about.

12:43.374 --> 12:46.277
Do you remember that time when you were
little and you ate that chocolate cake?

12:47.645 --> 12:49.513
When I asked you
what happened to the cake,

12:49.547 --> 12:51.415
you told me, "I don't know
what you're talking about."

12:51.449 --> 12:54.218
You said it with cake
and frosting all over your face.

12:54.251 --> 12:56.687
Come on,
that wasn't even the same.

12:56.721 --> 12:58.857
Then you admit you did it?

12:58.890 --> 13:00.725
Well, of course I did it.

13:00.758 --> 13:02.393
Who else could have done it?

13:09.467 --> 13:14.538
But I only did it because I didn't
want you and Mom to get divorced.

13:15.974 --> 13:18.409
I understand that, sweetie.

13:18.442 --> 13:21.746
And I'm sure you understand that the
love your mom and I used to share,

13:21.779 --> 13:26.651
it's just not something you can
hack into a computer and fix.

13:26.684 --> 13:29.687
Well, give me
a big enough computer.

13:31.422 --> 13:33.591
I mean, you can
hack into the system,

13:33.624 --> 13:36.827
and you can delete all records
of our impending divorce.

13:38.696 --> 13:40.798
But you can't change how we
feel in our hearts, sweetie.

13:42.466 --> 13:46.804
People fall in love
and sometimes they fall out.

13:53.979 --> 13:56.714
Yeah, Dad, people fall in love
with each other.

13:56.747 --> 13:58.516
Sometimes,
only one of them falls out.

13:59.517 --> 14:00.952
Sweetie.

14:09.360 --> 14:11.696
She's not too happy with me,
is she?

14:11.729 --> 14:14.632
She just needs some time.

14:14.665 --> 14:16.434
Look after our girl, Sam.

14:26.844 --> 14:28.646
Okay.

14:28.679 --> 14:32.349
Sam, now don't be rude.

14:32.383 --> 14:33.852
That's disgusting.

14:33.885 --> 14:35.486
Eh...

14:37.354 --> 14:40.291
Bondi, young lady,
what did I just say?

14:41.960 --> 14:44.896
Hm.

14:48.599 --> 14:52.003
Hey, Bondi, you know that I
hate phones at the dinner table.

14:52.037 --> 14:56.007
Mom, you know, the office
has to be able to reach me 24/7.

14:56.041 --> 14:59.477
Oh, it's not from the office.

14:59.510 --> 15:01.378
It's a text from unknown number.

15:01.412 --> 15:04.015
Somebody's got a crush on you.

15:04.049 --> 15:06.885
What? What?

15:06.918 --> 15:09.386
People don't say that word?

15:09.420 --> 15:11.489
- Mom.
- I mean, who is it?

15:11.522 --> 15:12.891
I don't know.

15:12.924 --> 15:15.359
I did say it was
an unknown number, didn't I?

15:16.862 --> 15:19.430
Yes, you did, dear.

15:19.463 --> 15:20.932
You know what, though,
since I've already said

15:20.966 --> 15:23.034
that I don't like phones
at the dinner table,

15:23.068 --> 15:26.437
maybe you put the phone down
and finish your dinner.

16:05.076 --> 16:08.379
I wanna thank you all
for coming on such short notice.

16:08.412 --> 16:10.447
We are paid to be here, Chief.

16:10.481 --> 16:13.384
And it's first thing
Monday morning, Chief.

16:13.417 --> 16:16.654
Quite right.
Where was I? Oh, yes.

16:16.687 --> 16:19.423
We learned something troubling
from the intelligence

16:19.456 --> 16:21.792
we retrieved
from our last mission.

16:21.826 --> 16:23.895
I direct your attention
to the screen.

16:23.929 --> 16:28.365
This is the earliest
known photo of Daniel Hawthorne,

16:28.399 --> 16:30.701
and I'm being
quite literal about that.

16:30.734 --> 16:32.904
There's no record
of his existence

16:32.938 --> 16:35.840
before he was arrested
and had this mugshot taken.

16:35.874 --> 16:39.376
- What was he arrested for?
- Loitering.

16:39.410 --> 16:41.146
Hanging around with no purpose.

16:41.179 --> 16:42.981
Some guys are just born bad.

16:43.014 --> 16:45.816
This is Hawthorne again,

16:45.850 --> 16:47.618
on the occasion
of his second arrest.

16:47.651 --> 16:48.854
What for this time?

16:48.887 --> 16:52.023
- Loitering with intent.
- Upping his game.

16:53.859 --> 16:55.426
He looks sad.

16:55.459 --> 16:58.429
Of course, he's sad,
he's a bad guy.

16:58.462 --> 17:01.398
Bad guys are sad by definition.

17:01.432 --> 17:04.535
If they weren't sad,
they wouldn't be bad guys.

17:04.568 --> 17:08.638
Yeah, I know, but trust me on this
one, Chief, this guy's sad.

17:08.672 --> 17:12.443
Be that as it may,
we now have evidence he must be stopped.

17:12.476 --> 17:15.881
- So stop him, we will.
- Mm-hm.

17:15.914 --> 17:21.819
If you're not vigilant,
milk can sour before you know it.

17:21.853 --> 17:26.892
Sure, it smells all right today,
but what about tomorrow?

17:26.925 --> 17:28.826
You wake up one morning...

17:28.860 --> 17:30.728
...pour a tall glass

17:30.761 --> 17:34.132
and that's when
it hits you, pow!

17:34.165 --> 17:37.035
A mouthful of injustice.

17:37.068 --> 17:40.038
Finish your milk
before the expiration date,

17:40.071 --> 17:45.176
before it turns on you.

17:45.210 --> 17:48.445
He's doing his
Patton thing again.

17:48.479 --> 17:52.117
What I'm trying to say
is this guy is milk

17:52.150 --> 17:55.186
with an approaching
expiration date.

17:55.220 --> 17:59.925
We have to stop him before
he becomes completely sour.

18:10.534 --> 18:12.836
All over
the milk metaphor, Chief.

18:19.110 --> 18:21.112
This is a photo of him

18:21.146 --> 18:25.649
when he adopted the nickname
"Alpha Dog."

18:25.683 --> 18:29.988
Intelligence indicates he's
embraced the role of arch villain

18:30.021 --> 18:32.857
and is attempting to build
some sort of new weapon.

18:32.891 --> 18:35.826
New weapon?
What's that even mean?

18:35.860 --> 18:39.663
That we don't know.
Intelligence is patchy at best.

18:39.697 --> 18:42.968
But we know with his unit
in the Council of Crime,

18:43.001 --> 18:46.071
he's intending on using
whatever it is

18:46.104 --> 18:48.605
to unleash his evil scheme.

18:48.639 --> 18:52.609
His secret base is located
on this island.

18:52.643 --> 18:56.480
He calls it "Wolfhound Island."

18:59.750 --> 19:02.519
Okay, partner,
this is our biggest mission yet,

19:02.553 --> 19:04.122
and our most important.

19:04.155 --> 19:06.790
We can't let Alpha Dog
complete his plan.

19:06.824 --> 19:09.894
We've had plenty of training with
the jetpack in simulation mode.

19:09.928 --> 19:11.863
Are you confident
you can do this for real?

19:14.099 --> 19:17.135
Like always, I'll be with you
every step of the way,

19:17.168 --> 19:19.703
so when you're safely on the
island, just find a place to hide

19:19.737 --> 19:23.108
until I'm back at command
and online, okay?

19:23.141 --> 19:25.609
Make sure you
come back to me, Sam.

19:25.642 --> 19:27.678
You mean more to me
than this mission.

19:45.363 --> 19:48.900
Bondi, you checked these waters
for sharks, right?

19:48.933 --> 19:51.769
<i>Yep, 100% shark infestation.</i>

19:53.670 --> 19:56.307
Well, at least they're
down there and I'm up here.

21:15.220 --> 21:16.321
Doctor.

21:18.056 --> 21:19.924
Doctor Devious.

21:22.127 --> 21:23.261
Devious!

21:25.230 --> 21:27.031
You trying to scare me to death?

21:28.900 --> 21:31.735
And what do I owe the pleasure
of this visit to my lab?

21:31.768 --> 21:34.738
Make no mistake, Doctor,
this is my lab.

21:34.771 --> 21:35.907
- Oh, please.
- And the work...

21:38.343 --> 21:42.380
The work you're doing here
is at my discretion.

21:42.413 --> 21:45.682
Oh, really,
I totally forgot.

21:45.716 --> 21:48.685
Thanks for reminding me
every time you get a chance.

21:48.719 --> 21:51.990
Let's not get caught up
in semantics, Doctor.

21:52.023 --> 21:54.959
Instead, let's inspect
the troops, shall we?

21:58.263 --> 22:00.664
- Yes.
- Excellent.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.369
There's been a few setbacks,
I'm afraid.

22:11.309 --> 22:14.045
Yes!

22:14.078 --> 22:17.015
Handsome specimens, Doctor.
Yes, yes.

22:19.884 --> 22:21.252
What are their names?

22:22.253 --> 22:23.787
- Names?
- Yes.

22:23.820 --> 22:25.223
They're robots,
they don't have names.

22:25.256 --> 22:27.458
Yes, surely,
since we created them,

22:27.492 --> 22:29.093
we could give them some names.

22:29.127 --> 22:32.931
They're not people,
they're robot dogs.

22:32.964 --> 22:36.935
Yes, but Doctor,
I can't just say, "Dog, attack."

22:36.968 --> 22:38.870
And what if both dogs attack
the same thing

22:38.903 --> 22:41.072
and there's multiple things
that need to be attacked.

22:41.105 --> 22:43.041
And then we're not winning
the attack,

22:43.074 --> 22:45.210
the next thing you know,
it's total chaos.

22:45.243 --> 22:47.512
Oh, attacking, is that part of the plan?
I didn't know that.

22:47.545 --> 22:50.481
Is attacking part of the plan
to take over the world?

22:50.515 --> 22:52.016
Is that a serious question,
Doctor?

22:52.050 --> 22:53.484
Yes, from time to time,
we may need to

22:53.518 --> 22:55.853
attack something here and there.

22:55.887 --> 22:58.822
Clearly you're new
to this whole evil thing.

23:00.791 --> 23:04.262
Listen, I only took this job,
because you promised me

23:04.295 --> 23:07.298
unlimited funding
for development.

23:07.332 --> 23:09.800
Yes, yes, whatever,
just show me the dogs.

23:09.833 --> 23:11.302
Bring them to life.

23:12.836 --> 23:16.241
Okay. Oh, well, let me
introduce you to them.

23:16.274 --> 23:17.875
- I have named them.
- Mm.

23:17.909 --> 23:21.412
- This one's named Number One.
- Oh.

23:22.413 --> 23:25.216
And Reginald Cornwell...

23:25.250 --> 23:27.784
No, I think we'll
go with Number Two.

23:27.818 --> 23:29.988
You like them?
Named them myself.

23:32.490 --> 23:36.394
Number One... heel.

23:49.407 --> 23:51.909
Number Two, heel.

23:51.943 --> 23:55.446
Oh!
Very nice, Doctor, very nice.

24:03.054 --> 24:06.124
Number Two, fetch.

24:13.031 --> 24:15.967
Okay, back to Number One.
Let's see what you can do.

24:26.110 --> 24:30.081
Doctor, do you think
I want to be a laughing stock?

24:30.114 --> 24:32.150
Do you think I wanna take over
the world with laughter?

24:33.151 --> 24:34.519
No!

24:34.552 --> 24:37.855
Okay, Number Two,
it's all up to you now.

24:40.291 --> 24:43.361
Number Two.
Number Two!

24:43.394 --> 24:47.098
It's safe to say
that we can call them both

24:47.131 --> 24:49.367
big stinking piles
of number two.

24:49.400 --> 24:52.170
Good job, though.

25:02.547 --> 25:05.450
Doctor, you assured me this
was well within your skill set,

25:05.483 --> 25:08.019
but prototypes
are not exactly inspiring hope.

25:08.052 --> 25:10.421
I know, I think...
I think it's a problem with the AI.

25:10.455 --> 25:12.590
What do I care about AI?

25:12.623 --> 25:14.592
I want weapons,
not thinking soldiers.

25:14.625 --> 25:18.396
You want me to make
brainless robo-dogs?

25:18.429 --> 25:20.598
What do I want
with a thinking canon ball?

25:20.631 --> 25:24.135
I don't know, maybe so it
won't aim for the wrong target!

25:24.168 --> 25:25.903
Doctor, as far as I'm concerned,

25:25.937 --> 25:27.672
as long as it's aimed in
the right direction,

25:27.705 --> 25:29.507
there are no wrong targets.

25:30.508 --> 25:31.642
This guy...

25:35.480 --> 25:37.382
Hi, there.

25:37.415 --> 25:39.117
Where'd you come from?

25:42.120 --> 25:44.389
Are you one of my dad's
test subjects or something?

25:46.324 --> 25:49.260
Are you spying on Dad
and that creepy doctor guy?

25:57.101 --> 25:58.569
Code Red, agent discovered.

25:58.603 --> 26:00.705
I repeat,
agent has been discovered.

26:00.738 --> 26:03.007
Calm down, Miss James,

26:03.040 --> 26:06.077
the agent is an expert
at covert operations.

26:06.110 --> 26:10.281
Remember the time he posed as a Hollywood
producer and actually won an Oscar?

26:12.016 --> 26:14.552
Yeah, you're right.

26:14.585 --> 26:16.220
We still laugh about that.

26:20.625 --> 26:23.461
<i>Obviously, you're not one of
my dad's ridiculous robot dogs,</i>

26:23.494 --> 26:28.099
<i>but what's this weird thing
on your head?</i>

26:31.469 --> 26:33.471
Trust me, nobody would blame you

26:33.504 --> 26:36.140
for wanting to escape
this creepy place.

26:36.174 --> 26:38.276
Only reason I'm down here
is I'm trying to find my dad

26:38.309 --> 26:40.611
to see if he even remembers
it's my birthday today.

26:47.351 --> 26:50.688
Oh, that's nice.

26:52.156 --> 26:53.391
Thank you.

26:56.527 --> 26:59.397
Happy birthday.

26:59.430 --> 27:01.098
You talked.

27:12.343 --> 27:14.712
Pumpkin, I thought I heard
something out here.

27:14.745 --> 27:16.113
What are you doing down here?

27:16.147 --> 27:18.216
Haven't I told you
not to come down here?

27:18.249 --> 27:20.451
You know this is
just like you, Dad,

27:20.485 --> 27:22.653
to assume
I'm doing something wrong.

27:22.687 --> 27:24.388
It never occurred to you
I might be so bored,

27:24.422 --> 27:26.457
I'd want to explore
this stupid island?

27:26.491 --> 27:28.259
Sweetie, I'm not accusing you
of anything.

27:28.292 --> 27:29.660
I just didn't want you to...

27:29.694 --> 27:31.429
And anyway,
it's raining outside,

27:31.462 --> 27:34.499
so even if I wanted to go
someplace else, I can't.

27:34.532 --> 27:36.267
So where am I supposed to go?

27:36.300 --> 27:38.069
Honey, I don't know
where this is coming from.

27:38.102 --> 27:40.271
Can-can we
talk about this later?

27:40.304 --> 27:42.373
Go talk to your robots.

27:46.711 --> 27:48.579
Must be difficult

27:48.613 --> 27:51.082
balancing the responsibilities
of fatherhood

27:51.115 --> 27:54.385
with the obsessive demands
of creating criminal robots.

27:57.622 --> 28:00.525
Doctor, it would appear
we're both having

28:00.558 --> 28:03.261
programming problems
with our creations.

28:03.294 --> 28:06.764
Although, I fear yours is going to
be much easier to fix than mine.

28:08.232 --> 28:10.801
But first,
I have guests to attend to.

28:36.427 --> 28:39.130
- Whoo.
- Hey.

28:40.866 --> 28:43.100
Seriously, what's that thing
on your head?

28:44.635 --> 28:46.671
Are you a secret agent
or something?

28:49.740 --> 28:52.543
Will this allow me
to communicate with aliens?

28:53.711 --> 28:57.782
Uh...

29:00.651 --> 29:03.487
Disaster averted.

29:03.521 --> 29:05.556
I never had a moment's doubt.

29:05.590 --> 29:08.159
Awesome. Still gotta feel
sorry for her,

29:08.192 --> 29:09.527
having no friends like that.

29:22.273 --> 29:24.275
Oh, um...

29:24.308 --> 29:27.144
I've told my mom
not to text me during work.

29:27.178 --> 29:29.647
Miss James.

29:29.680 --> 29:32.416
Beyond issues
of professionalism,

29:32.450 --> 29:35.186
I must ask to see your phone
due to security.

29:35.219 --> 29:38.389
Honestly, you've been
warned about this.

29:38.422 --> 29:42.293
Well, now who is this
secret admirer?

29:43.628 --> 29:45.663
For heaven's sake, Miss James,

29:45.696 --> 29:49.400
he's announcing right from the
start his identity is a secret.

29:49.433 --> 29:53.638
How can you possibly trust somebody
whose identity is a secret?

30:24.702 --> 30:26.804
What are you doing?

30:28.974 --> 30:31.175
Forehead.

30:34.612 --> 30:36.948
Queen Evil.

30:39.250 --> 30:41.452
Chrome Dome.

30:44.255 --> 30:47.191
Crimson Ghost, so spooky.

30:50.294 --> 30:54.632
Welcome to Wolfhound Island.

30:54.665 --> 30:55.733
You know,
perhaps maybe you all

30:55.766 --> 30:57.501
should think of
changing your names

30:57.535 --> 30:59.236
to something a bit more
dog-related,

30:59.270 --> 31:02.440
since I am the Alpha Dog leader
of this Council of Crime.

31:02.473 --> 31:04.943
- No.
- Yeah, well, maybe you should add some chamomile

31:04.976 --> 31:07.545
to your decaf there, Forehead, old buddy.
Bring it down a notch.

31:07.578 --> 31:10.848
Anyway, just the name thing,
just something to think about, ponder over.

31:10.882 --> 31:13.350
Why did you summon us
here today?

31:13.384 --> 31:15.653
I had to miss a spa appointment.

31:15.686 --> 31:18.422
And I had a book club
I was looking forward to.

31:18.456 --> 31:20.992
Oh! I just started
<i>Pride and Prejudice</i> myself.

31:21.026 --> 31:23.260
Ooh, that's a good one.

31:24.729 --> 31:26.965
What?!

31:26.998 --> 31:31.435
Tell you the truth,
we didn't think you could read.

31:31.469 --> 31:33.370
Well, I can read well enough
to know the difference

31:33.404 --> 31:36.807
between push and pull
on the conference room door.

31:37.808 --> 31:39.577
It was one time.

31:39.610 --> 31:42.580
All right...
children.

31:42.613 --> 31:45.416
I called you
all here today to tell you

31:45.449 --> 31:49.320
that we are going to
take over the world.

31:49.353 --> 31:52.057
Oh, that again.

31:52.090 --> 31:54.759
Yes, how many times
will that make it this year?

31:54.792 --> 31:57.863
Quite a lot, actually, uh,
about as many as you have exes.

31:57.896 --> 32:02.000
That was supposed to be
between us, Forehead.

32:02.033 --> 32:03.969
What is even
happening right now?

32:04.002 --> 32:05.971
What is this,
some type of therapy group?

32:06.004 --> 32:10.407
Listen, this time is different.

32:10.441 --> 32:12.409
I have a foolproof plan.

32:12.443 --> 32:15.713
But first,
I must attend to something.

32:15.746 --> 32:18.516
You're my guests,
make yourselves comfortable.

32:18.549 --> 32:19.885
Keep your feet of the furniture,

32:19.918 --> 32:22.087
TTFN.

32:22.120 --> 32:24.555
They're like a bunch of tweens.

32:24.588 --> 32:27.558
"He said this,
she said that. I like K-pop."

32:27.591 --> 32:28.960
Actually,
I do kind of like K-pop.

32:34.900 --> 32:38.469
This is my room...
supposedly.

32:38.502 --> 32:39.837
Really, it's more like
my dad's room

32:39.871 --> 32:42.640
because he's the one
who designed it.

32:42.673 --> 32:46.044
I think it's his weird way of
trying to put me in shrink wrap

32:46.077 --> 32:47.913
and make me stay
his little girl.

32:50.447 --> 32:51.715
See what I mean?

32:51.749 --> 32:55.553
He thinks I still
play with stuffed animals.

32:55.586 --> 32:58.422
Sometimes I think he wishes
I was a stuffed animal.

32:58.455 --> 33:01.026
Then he could keep me
in a cabinet forever.

33:04.963 --> 33:07.464
You guys could be brothers.

33:07.498 --> 33:08.666
Hm.

33:08.699 --> 33:09.968
I wish I had a brother.

33:11.468 --> 33:12.871
Or a sister.

33:14.973 --> 33:16.942
Or that my mom was still around.

33:22.613 --> 33:23.747
Pumpkin?

33:25.583 --> 33:27.618
- Dad.
- Well, I thought I heard you

33:27.651 --> 33:29.020
talking to somebody in here.

33:29.054 --> 33:32.823
That's a stretch,
there's nobody to talk to.

33:32.858 --> 33:36.127
Hey, didn't I tell you
to stay out of the lab?

33:36.161 --> 33:38.063
Honey, I'm sure the doctor's
looking for this.

33:39.064 --> 33:40.866
I-I didn't.

33:40.899 --> 33:44.401
You know, I know that
being stuck here on an island

33:44.435 --> 33:46.537
is not ideal,
especially at your age.

33:46.570 --> 33:48.173
I mean, look at your room.

33:48.206 --> 33:50.774
Yeah, I got to admit,
this is one of the better designs I did.

33:50.808 --> 33:54.179
Yeah, this room is fantastic.
I mean, look at your bed.

33:54.212 --> 33:57.715
I remember when you were little.
Your stuffed animals.

33:57.748 --> 34:00.651
Look at these.

34:03.721 --> 34:06.157
I remember
all these little guys.

34:06.191 --> 34:09.460
Hi, little puppy dog.

34:09.493 --> 34:12.063
Oh, there's a little sloth.
Oh, you're so cute.

34:39.090 --> 34:43.027
Wait a minute, what is this one?

34:44.228 --> 34:47.563
This monkey
is remarkably lifelike.

34:47.598 --> 34:49.034
- I-I...
- What do you want, Dad?

34:50.869 --> 34:54.973
Pumpkin... I owe you an apology.

34:55.005 --> 34:58.642
You know, I-I barked at you
in the hallway outside the lab

34:58.676 --> 35:01.146
and-and you didn't deserve that,
all right.

35:01.179 --> 35:04.082
It's just that, uh,
that dog in me.

35:04.115 --> 35:07.919
So what I did is something
we haven't done in a while.

35:07.953 --> 35:11.089
I set us up
to have dinner together.

35:11.122 --> 35:13.791
- Really?
- Yes, I set the whole thing up.

35:13.824 --> 35:19.097
What are we having? Chateaubriand?
Lobster Thermidor?

35:19.130 --> 35:20.764
All right, all right.

35:20.798 --> 35:23.567
No, we're having your favorite;

35:23.600 --> 35:27.872
chicken tenders, tater tots,
and pistachio ice cream.

35:29.540 --> 35:31.242
You remembered.

35:31.276 --> 35:33.610
Of course,
I remembered, pumpkin.

35:33.644 --> 35:36.948
I even got 'em to get that little zesty
honey mustard sauce that you like.

35:36.982 --> 35:38.649
Not too zesty.

35:38.682 --> 35:42.586
Not too sweet,
just like you pumpkin.

35:44.089 --> 35:46.157
Does the pistachio ice cream
have real pistachios?

35:46.191 --> 35:50.128
Of course, there's real nuts
in the pistachio ice cream.

35:56.834 --> 36:00.071
Kitchen, I need real pistachios
on the ice cream.

36:00.105 --> 36:03.807
I repeat, real pistachios
on the ice cream.

36:03.841 --> 36:05.176
Who are you talking to, Daddy?

36:05.210 --> 36:06.710
No one, sweetie.

36:09.847 --> 36:13.118
<i>Alpha Dog,
I can't locate any pistachio nuts?</i>

36:13.151 --> 36:16.287
Well, then I suggest
you relocate yourself

36:16.321 --> 36:18.189
to the local purveyor
of said nuts,

36:18.223 --> 36:19.790
or a lack of pistachio nuts
is going to be

36:19.823 --> 36:20.892
the least of your worries.

36:20.925 --> 36:23.094
Do you understand me?

36:23.128 --> 36:25.263
- Who are you talking to, Daddy?
- Oh, nobody, sweetie.

36:25.296 --> 36:27.165
You there, where are you going?
Never mind, I don't care.

36:27.198 --> 36:28.867
Take this back to the lab.

36:30.935 --> 36:33.670
Oh, no.
Did you hear that, Chief?

36:33.704 --> 36:35.106
We have to go in.

36:39.077 --> 36:43.214
No, he didn't activate
his emergency beacon.

36:43.248 --> 36:45.884
We let him do the job
he trained for.

36:46.985 --> 36:48.719
What do we do in the meantime?

36:48.752 --> 36:52.823
We wait.
That's all we can do right now.

36:59.763 --> 37:01.132
Nobody.

37:01.166 --> 37:03.368
Nobody.

37:03.401 --> 37:05.103
Nobody!

37:05.136 --> 37:08.173
Did you hear that?
He called me "nobody."

37:08.206 --> 37:10.141
Hey, don't worry about it.

37:10.175 --> 37:12.277
Sometimes it's best
not to stand out.

37:12.310 --> 37:16.081
That's easy for you to say.
I'm the Wolfhound chef!

37:16.114 --> 37:19.350
I have to plan the meals,
monitor supplies,

37:19.384 --> 37:23.221
buy the groceries, prep, cook the
food, and clean the kitchen.

37:23.254 --> 37:25.223
Sometimes he changes the menu
on a whim.

37:25.256 --> 37:28.625
And whose fault is it if I
don't have his demands?

37:29.928 --> 37:31.329
Mine!

37:31.362 --> 37:33.932
First one up in the morning,
the last one to go to bed,

37:33.965 --> 37:36.733
seven days a week,
365 days a year.

37:36.767 --> 37:38.203
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

37:38.236 --> 37:42.173
Don't forget about leap years.
That adds a day.

37:44.976 --> 37:47.312
You are not helping!

37:47.345 --> 37:49.380
<i>Hello there.</i>

37:50.714 --> 37:52.283
- <i>Alpha Dog.</i>
- Yes, sir.

37:52.317 --> 37:55.153
<i>I just wanted to let you know
that you left the intercom on.</i>

37:55.186 --> 37:57.788
Perhaps you can stop whining
about the pistachios.

37:57.821 --> 37:59.290
I can always have
one of the men in the armory

37:59.324 --> 38:01.825
stuff you into a cannon
and shoot you across the island.

38:01.860 --> 38:04.395
- No, sir.
- <i>We'll see you soon enough</i>

38:04.429 --> 38:06.763
<i>with that wonderful
pistachio ice cream</i>

38:06.797 --> 38:08.333
<i>with the real nuts, of course.</i>

38:08.366 --> 38:11.436
<i>And uh, uh, uh,
over and out, Chef.</i>

38:11.469 --> 38:13.004
<i>That means hang up.</i>

38:13.037 --> 38:16.141
Now what's wrong?
He called you "Chef."

38:16.174 --> 38:19.310
Yeah, but he coulda said,
please though.

38:19.344 --> 38:21.346
Dude, he's a super villain.

38:21.379 --> 38:23.448
"Please"
ain't in his vocabulary.

38:23.481 --> 38:27.718
Well, someone ought to tell him
politeness goes a long way.

38:27.751 --> 38:30.388
Again, super villain.

38:54.279 --> 38:55.380
Hmm.

39:02.954 --> 39:05.156
Alpha Dog told me to give this to you.

39:06.757 --> 39:07.959
Thanks.

39:07.992 --> 39:11.262
Evil genius, schmevil genius.

39:13.531 --> 39:15.799
Stupid.

39:17.202 --> 39:19.404
I need to recharge.

39:31.216 --> 39:34.886
Pumpkin, do you have the salt?

39:34.919 --> 39:36.487
- Sorry?
- The salt!

39:36.521 --> 39:38.456
Oh, yeah, it's right here.

39:38.489 --> 39:40.191
Butler, salt!

39:41.492 --> 39:43.760
Go!

39:47.131 --> 39:48.366
Thank you, sweetie.

39:49.833 --> 39:51.869
Dad, do you have the sauce?

39:51.903 --> 39:53.004
Uh, what's that, sweetie?

39:53.037 --> 39:54.906
- The sauce.
- The sauce?

39:54.939 --> 39:57.841
- Yes.
- Butler, sauce for my daughter!

39:57.875 --> 39:59.843
Hurry up,
my daughter needs sauce.

40:03.248 --> 40:04.848
There you go, honey.

40:06.317 --> 40:08.386
Sweetie, how are the carrots?

40:08.419 --> 40:10.255
- Oh, they're-they're great.
- Oh, wonderful.

40:10.288 --> 40:12.390
Butler, carrots!

40:13.391 --> 40:15.226
Why are you so slow?

40:17.028 --> 40:19.796
Dad, why do I have to sit
all the way down here?

40:19.830 --> 40:22.233
What's that, sweetie?
You're too far away, I can't hear you.

40:22.267 --> 40:25.003
Why do I have to sit
all the way down here?

40:25.036 --> 40:27.939
- Uh, one more time.
- Down here.

41:06.344 --> 41:08.179
Hey!

41:08.212 --> 41:11.382
What do you think you're doing?

41:11.416 --> 41:15.086
It's my turn
to ride the merry-go-round.

41:15.119 --> 41:17.121
And I'm telling grandma.

41:30.435 --> 41:32.303
I knew you could do it.

41:32.337 --> 41:35.907
I think our agent's
back online, Miss James.

41:35.940 --> 41:39.610
Jeez, it's like being
on a Tilt-A-Whirl.

41:39.644 --> 41:43.381
Okay, partner, I've got
to sign off and head home.

41:43.414 --> 41:46.951
Apparently, the adults are talking
and I'm expected to attend.

41:48.419 --> 41:51.089
Stay hidden until I get back.

41:58.463 --> 41:59.630
He'll be all right.

41:59.664 --> 42:02.467
I know, I just hate it
when he's out all night.

42:02.500 --> 42:04.035
I worry about him.

42:04.068 --> 42:06.637
He'll know what to do.
He's smart like you.

42:06.671 --> 42:10.208
Thank you, you're sweet.

42:10.241 --> 42:12.643
It's just I feel like
everything in my life

42:12.677 --> 42:14.479
is changing right now.

42:14.512 --> 42:19.450
It's my parents, this job,
nothing is constant but Sam.

42:19.484 --> 42:20.985
I can always count on him.

42:21.018 --> 42:24.622
- And-and me.
- What about you?

42:24.655 --> 42:28.092
You can always count on me.

42:28.126 --> 42:30.161
I know we didn't start off
on the right foot,

42:30.194 --> 42:34.198
but you can always
count on me, Bondi.

42:34.232 --> 42:36.701
Now just go home and deal with
what you need to there.

42:36.734 --> 42:38.970
I'll stay here
and make sure Sam is good.

42:39.003 --> 42:40.638
Thank you, Johnny.

42:56.421 --> 42:57.922
This is tiresome!

42:59.490 --> 43:03.094
Typical powerplay,
making us wait.

43:03.127 --> 43:06.431
What do you expect from someone
who calls himself "Alpha Dog?"

43:06.464 --> 43:10.935
Indeed, Queen Evil.

43:13.304 --> 43:16.607
Cracking wise, Chrome Dome.

43:18.176 --> 43:21.746
I have no pretension
regarding my <i>nom de guerre.</i>

43:21.779 --> 43:26.250
I'm not hiding who
or what I am from anyone.

43:26.284 --> 43:28.352
Need I point out, my friend,

43:28.386 --> 43:31.222
you'd be hard-pressed
to hide from anyone.

43:33.524 --> 43:35.026
Oh, of course.

43:35.059 --> 43:38.729
Jokes about my shiny bald head,
how original.

43:39.797 --> 43:44.302
I chose to shave
every last hair.

43:44.335 --> 43:47.605
Oh, yes,
all three strands of hair,

43:47.638 --> 43:50.007
if I remember correctly.

43:50.041 --> 43:53.778
Guys, guys, guys, and ladies, and...
we're better than this.

43:53.811 --> 43:56.514
No, we're not.

43:56.547 --> 44:01.052
Although I hate to agree,
she's right.

44:01.085 --> 44:03.187
We are super villains,
after all.

44:03.221 --> 44:06.757
Vindictiveness is in
our job description.

44:06.791 --> 44:12.630
Oh, well, how foolish of me
to think that a group of people

44:12.663 --> 44:16.567
that want to take over the world
could possibly work together.

44:16.601 --> 44:18.436
It's like expecting children
to share a toy,

44:18.469 --> 44:22.106
except in this case,
the toy in question, me,

44:22.139 --> 44:26.010
is running the greatest criminal
conspiracy the world has ever seen.

44:27.178 --> 44:28.346
Now...

44:31.482 --> 44:33.017
I have an idea.

44:46.397 --> 44:47.465
Why am I always standing?

44:47.498 --> 44:50.635
Okay, here's my idea, all right.

44:50.668 --> 44:52.537
I mean,
we're all friends here, right?

44:52.570 --> 44:54.739
I mean, roll with it, okay.

44:54.772 --> 44:56.541
We're always lashing out
at each other

44:56.574 --> 44:58.809
because of our,
your, insecurities.

44:58.843 --> 45:01.646
So what I'm thinking is
perhaps maybe we just...

45:01.679 --> 45:06.784
Let's go around the room and say
something about the other that we like.

45:08.352 --> 45:10.788
I'll-I'll start. I'll start.

45:10.821 --> 45:15.693
Chrome Dome, why don't you say
something that you like about me?

45:20.364 --> 45:22.733
This is madness.

45:22.767 --> 45:27.171
How dare the four of you
slander the name of Villainry,

45:27.204 --> 45:32.410
a name we fought
so hard to keep?

45:32.443 --> 45:36.213
I will not be a part of this,
so stop it.

45:37.648 --> 45:40.551
All right, so first round,
pretty good so far.

45:40.585 --> 45:42.820
Little negative in one area,
we'll work on it.

45:42.854 --> 45:45.189
But, you know,
why don't you guys all,

45:45.222 --> 45:48.192
you know, keep at it for a little
bit, I mean, it'll get a bit better.

45:48.225 --> 45:50.728
I-I really believe that
this is going to work for us.

45:50.761 --> 45:54.599
I am just going to go somewhere
a little less sad.

46:01.606 --> 46:04.542
Oh, that was exhausting.

46:27.565 --> 46:28.633
Eureka!

46:40.211 --> 46:41.512
Remarkable.

46:44.782 --> 46:45.783
Oh.

46:48.252 --> 46:49.820
Remarkable.

46:52.590 --> 46:56.193
Hey, Dan... I mean, Alpha Dog...

46:58.262 --> 47:01.832
your presence is requested
in the testing chamber.

47:04.235 --> 47:06.170
Immediately.

47:16.747 --> 47:20.484
Doctor, I certainly hope
you have some good news.

47:20.518 --> 47:24.655
Hmm. Sometimes I find
the best solution to a problem

47:24.689 --> 47:28.492
is to think outside the box.

47:28.526 --> 47:30.428
Hm.

47:30.461 --> 47:32.730
Well, spare me
the suspense, Doctor.

47:32.763 --> 47:34.532
What is it
that has you so excited?

47:34.565 --> 47:39.004
Consider; is a trade
for a soldier

47:39.037 --> 47:44.575
really that bad
if he was a touch... insane?

47:46.912 --> 47:49.014
Okay, easy, Doctor.

47:49.047 --> 47:52.017
But I think... I think I know
what you're getting at.

47:52.050 --> 47:54.785
Rather than fix the problem,
we should...

47:54.819 --> 47:59.991
Yes, precisely.
Don't correct it, harness it.

48:00.025 --> 48:02.760
- Hm.
- That led me to my latest discovery:

48:03.995 --> 48:05.763
Nanobots.

48:06.998 --> 48:10.434
Nanobots,
to control the dog-bots?

48:10.468 --> 48:14.505
Well, think of it
as a high-tech leash.

48:14.538 --> 48:16.540
Watch.

48:19.310 --> 48:20.478
Heel.

48:22.680 --> 48:25.483
It... It just heeled.
Do it again.

48:25.516 --> 48:26.851
Oh, and you're gonna love this.

48:27.852 --> 48:29.386
Roll over.

48:31.022 --> 48:34.025
- What? Stop it. He just rolled over.
- I know.

48:34.059 --> 48:35.726
When you told him to roll over,
he rolled over.

48:35.760 --> 48:39.830
Did you see it?
It was amazing.

48:39.865 --> 48:43.869
Devious, you mad genius!
Congratulations!

48:43.902 --> 48:46.403
You know, you have truly proven
that every dog

48:46.437 --> 48:50.307
does indeed have its day.

48:50.341 --> 48:53.344
Would you consider it premature
to tell the sponsors

48:53.377 --> 48:55.513
that we are back on track
for our original deadline?

48:55.546 --> 48:56.882
Oh, no, not at all.

48:56.915 --> 48:58.449
And now that I've surmised
what the problem was,

48:58.482 --> 48:59.683
I feel like putting it
all into motion

48:59.717 --> 49:01.452
shouldn't take any time at all.

49:01.485 --> 49:04.388
Outstanding!

49:04.421 --> 49:06.824
This country will rue the day that it
turned its back on Daniel Hawthorne.

49:06.858 --> 49:08.692
I mean...
Alpha Dog.

49:10.528 --> 49:13.430
<i>Why do you have to do that all the time?
You always bark.</i>

49:13.464 --> 49:16.034
- <i>We-we just had this moment and it was all perfect...</i>
- <i>It's my thing.</i>

49:16.067 --> 49:18.003
<i>And then you ended it with barking.</i>

49:18.036 --> 49:20.838
<i>Alpha Dog, it's a theme.
The outfit goes with it.</i>

49:20.872 --> 49:24.809
Okay, team, it looks like
the game is officially afoot.

49:24.842 --> 49:28.646
We all have jobs to do.
I suggest you do them.

49:28.679 --> 49:32.951
Miss James, tell the agent to sit
tight and await further orders.

49:32.984 --> 49:35.519
I shall instruct
the science team

49:35.553 --> 49:40.658
to look into how best to defeat these
so-called nanobots straight away.

49:46.730 --> 49:48.900
You there! Yes, you!

49:48.934 --> 49:50.902
Do you know
who let the dogs out?

49:50.936 --> 49:53.138
I did!

49:53.171 --> 49:55.639
Soundtrack guy, drop a beat.

50:14.192 --> 50:18.997
<i>O-M-G! He must be stopped.</i>

50:19.030 --> 50:22.133
Not just the plan,
but the dance.

50:22.167 --> 50:24.069
Chief says to sit tight

50:24.102 --> 50:27.005
while we get the techno geeks
cooking up a solution.

50:27.038 --> 50:29.773
In the meantime, keep an eye
on that crazy doctor,

50:29.807 --> 50:33.711
but more importantly,
be careful, partner.

50:36.114 --> 50:39.951
Seriously,
take care of yourself.

50:39.985 --> 50:42.620
I can't deal with losing
somebody else I love.

50:52.763 --> 50:54.565
You, uh...

50:54.598 --> 50:56.167
got a little something
there in your eye.

50:59.170 --> 51:00.804
Your third eye.

51:05.010 --> 51:07.678
I can't see!

51:11.715 --> 51:17.755
Mr. Alpha Dog, might I interpret
this ill-timed intrusion to mean...

51:17.788 --> 51:20.959
Wait, what is it you have there?

51:22.726 --> 51:25.964
Greetings, fellow followers
of felonious fascination.

51:25.997 --> 51:28.166
As our crimson compatriot
has noticed,

51:28.199 --> 51:29.935
even though the rest of you
have not...

51:31.769 --> 51:33.637
You're getting a dog?

51:33.671 --> 51:36.074
We're all getting dogs.

51:36.107 --> 51:38.109
The doctor has done it!

51:38.143 --> 51:40.946
Unlike previous models,
his new robo-dogs

51:40.979 --> 51:44.082
possess the ability
to follow instruction.

51:44.115 --> 51:48.019
We're off the leash.
No more leashes!

51:48.053 --> 51:52.656
So this-this is the reason
we're here on this island.

51:52.690 --> 51:59.264
You've obviously overcome
the obvious cognitive failure.

51:59.297 --> 52:01.066
But what leads us to believe

52:01.099 --> 52:03.935
they're capable
of following further direction?

52:03.969 --> 52:08.772
Yes, how do we know they actually run
any smoother than the previous lemons?

52:08.806 --> 52:12.077
Yes, yes, yes.
I oversold before, I'll admit it.

52:12.110 --> 52:17.115
But these new models surpass
all previous claims by a mile.

52:18.116 --> 52:19.750
Meaning?

52:19.783 --> 52:24.555
I mean, they are
fully self-aware and compliant.

52:24.588 --> 52:27.158
And waiting for us
to tell them what to do.

52:28.726 --> 52:32.596
- We want to see it.
- Yes, show us.

52:32.629 --> 52:36.034
- Where are they?
- Let us see what they can do.

52:36.067 --> 52:40.905
You will see their full power
unleashed...

52:40.939 --> 52:43.141
tomorrow at the unveiling.

52:54.618 --> 52:57.188
Hey, wait! Tomorrow?

53:19.777 --> 53:22.280
Hey, honey, can you get off your
phone at least to go to sleep?

53:27.886 --> 53:29.988
You're still waiting
on a response, aren't you?

53:33.058 --> 53:35.260
He said he was a secret admirer,

53:35.293 --> 53:37.594
but then he didn't bother
to respond.

53:38.662 --> 53:40.664
Yeah.

53:40.697 --> 53:43.134
I mean, I know where
you're coming from there, hon.

53:46.104 --> 53:50.141
You know,
when your dad and I first met.

53:50.175 --> 53:52.576
Yeah, well,
where did that end up?

53:54.212 --> 53:55.679
He left us.

53:57.248 --> 53:58.249
He left me.

53:59.250 --> 54:01.886
No, honey.

54:03.021 --> 54:05.290
Your dad's not completely gone.

54:06.690 --> 54:09.094
And he's still gonna
be in your life.

54:09.127 --> 54:11.362
He's...

54:11.396 --> 54:17.102
just a guy trying to...
figure out who he is.

54:19.304 --> 54:23.007
Yeah, well, he should
figure out he's my dad.

54:51.169 --> 54:54.239
Hi, there.
I wondered where you got off to.

54:56.074 --> 55:00.677
My mom used to bring me out here
to fly kites and collect rocks.

55:00.711 --> 55:03.014
She said by doing both,
you could have

55:03.047 --> 55:05.716
your head in the clouds
and your feet on the ground.

55:09.320 --> 55:10.754
Yeah, I know.

55:10.787 --> 55:12.457
My dad, right?

55:12.490 --> 55:14.225
My mom was so much
smarter than him.

55:14.259 --> 55:15.894
Mm-hm.

55:17.195 --> 55:19.931
That's the thing,
my dad never started

55:19.964 --> 55:22.766
this whole stupid thing
until after she died.

55:22.799 --> 55:25.436
It's like her cancer
made him so mad at the world,

55:25.470 --> 55:28.139
he decided to take it over
to punish it.

55:29.407 --> 55:31.876
She's out here, you know?

55:31.910 --> 55:34.678
My mom, I mean, she's...

55:37.048 --> 55:41.886
My dad had her cremated and we
spread her ashes in the surf.

55:41.920 --> 55:43.988
That way I can
always visit her out here.

55:45.756 --> 55:48.426
I like to think a little of her
is in each one of these rocks.

55:53.898 --> 55:55.166
Hey, look at this one.

56:11.082 --> 56:13.151
You know,
we are pretty good at this.

56:13.184 --> 56:15.920
Of course, we're good at this,

56:15.954 --> 56:19.090
we're getting paid by the CIA
to do what we'd be doing

56:19.123 --> 56:21.059
if we were in our homes
eating frozen pizza.

56:21.092 --> 56:23.861
Oh, man, I would be
on my computer, no doubt,

56:23.895 --> 56:26.197
but I definitely wouldn't be
eating that frozen pizza.

56:26.231 --> 56:28.967
You crazy?
You don't like pizza?

56:29.000 --> 56:32.437
I was talking about hacking
for good instead of, you know.

56:32.470 --> 56:36.441
Pizza is negligible.
Crust, sauce, toppings.

56:36.474 --> 56:38.443
It's what you
do with it that counts.

56:38.476 --> 56:40.178
You bring frozen
into the picture,

56:40.211 --> 56:41.879
you're talking about
processed food.

56:41.913 --> 56:45.416
And that is where
I draw the line.

56:45.450 --> 56:49.354
Okay, I got the president
breathing down my back

56:49.387 --> 56:51.956
and he's got a golf game
at 11:00,

56:51.990 --> 56:55.260
so he's expecting us
to give him an answer by 10:59.

56:55.293 --> 56:57.462
- You, with the hat.
- Well, sir, before I start,

56:57.495 --> 57:00.965
- can I just say how much I appreciate...
- No time.

57:00.999 --> 57:01.899
You, with the phone.

57:01.933 --> 57:03.434
Sorry to interrupt.

57:03.468 --> 57:05.470
It appears that
you're more concerned

57:05.503 --> 57:07.804
with your social media presence

57:07.838 --> 57:10.341
than you are with helping solve
this problem confronting us.

57:10.375 --> 57:13.311
Sorry about the phone, Chief.
Helps me think.

57:13.344 --> 57:15.213
You wanna take down
Alpha Dog's plan.

57:15.246 --> 57:19.150
Ironically, it was that devious
doctor dude that gave us the idea.

57:19.183 --> 57:22.086
I mean, it's like we were
just talking about frozen pizza.

57:22.120 --> 57:26.457
There's nothing wrong with pizza as long as
you're talking about the basic ingredients:

57:26.491 --> 57:31.262
the crust, the sauce,
the cheese, and the toppings.

57:31.296 --> 57:36.334
But when it's processed and loaded
with salt, that's when things go wrong.

57:36.367 --> 57:39.237
So you're saying a Trojan horse?

57:39.270 --> 57:41.072
Well, what you would call
a "Trojan horse,"

57:41.105 --> 57:43.308
we would call a "worm,"
but same difference.

57:43.341 --> 57:47.145
Well, in this case,
the worm is the salt.

57:48.146 --> 57:51.582
I like it. Make it so.

57:51.616 --> 57:55.320
I'll alert the president,
we have a plan in place.

57:55.353 --> 57:58.122
Then I shall have
a spot of lunch.

57:58.156 --> 58:01.059
I'm suddenly feeling
a bit peckish.

58:07.498 --> 58:08.933
<i>Today is the day.</i>

58:08.966 --> 58:11.102
<i>Your job is to gain access
to the lab</i>

58:11.135 --> 58:12.603
<i>and the Nano-Bot computer.</i>

58:12.637 --> 58:15.139
<i>You manage that,
and we'll do the rest.</i>

58:17.675 --> 58:20.945
<i>Once the Trojan horse it
successfully installed in the network</i>

58:20.978 --> 58:22.280
<i>we'll unleash the worm.</i>

58:22.313 --> 58:25.183
<i>Then the worm can work
its diabolical magic.</i>

58:25.216 --> 58:27.318
Mm.

58:37.028 --> 58:39.330
- There you are.
- Hm.

58:39.364 --> 58:40.965
I was starting to think
you were like

58:40.998 --> 58:42.467
an imaginary guardian angel

58:42.500 --> 58:44.135
who just shows up
when I need you,

58:44.168 --> 58:47.238
but you're really real,
aren't you?

58:47.271 --> 58:51.008
Hm. Ah, at least it's real
as a talking ape can be.

58:51.042 --> 58:54.278
But why do I still feel like somehow
you're my guardian angel, too?

59:06.357 --> 59:07.525
What's this?

59:10.595 --> 59:12.597
I'm not gonna like
what's on this, am I?

59:22.707 --> 59:25.042
You're one mysterious monkey.

59:25.076 --> 59:27.278
Don't hate the player,
hate the game.

59:27.311 --> 59:29.013
And don't call me a monkey.

59:29.046 --> 59:30.181
I prefer chimp.

59:39.424 --> 59:41.659
That's why you're here,
isn't it?

59:43.661 --> 59:45.596
You're supposed to stop my dad.

59:49.100 --> 59:53.070
In that case, all I can say...

59:54.505 --> 59:56.574
is good luck, my guardian angel.

01:00:03.381 --> 01:00:04.982
What can I do to help?

01:00:18.663 --> 01:00:21.599
Whoa!
Are those sharks in the water?

01:00:24.235 --> 01:00:27.371
Time is a-wastin',
as my dad likes to say,

01:00:27.405 --> 01:00:29.507
so as soon as you
receive the payload,

01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:30.541
<i>you know what to do.</i>

01:00:51.462 --> 01:00:55.399
Miss James, while I appreciate
your dedication to the mission,

01:00:55.433 --> 01:00:58.769
I'm not entirely comfortable
involving his daughter.

01:00:58.803 --> 01:01:02.306
It strikes me
as not entirely ethical.

01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:04.141
She offered, Chief.

01:01:04.175 --> 01:01:07.345
That's hardly the point, Miss
James, and you well know it.

01:01:08.379 --> 01:01:10.414
Trust me on this one, Chief.

01:01:10.448 --> 01:01:12.817
She's a young girl
forced to confront the reality

01:01:12.850 --> 01:01:16.254
that her father isn't the perfect
person she always thought he was.

01:01:16.287 --> 01:01:19.423
Asserting a little independence
will be good for her.

01:01:27.465 --> 01:01:29.133
Doctor, Doctor!

01:01:29.166 --> 01:01:30.268
What?

01:01:31.702 --> 01:01:33.538
Greetings, Rebecca.

01:01:33.571 --> 01:01:35.406
What do I owe the pleasure
of this visit?

01:01:35.439 --> 01:01:38.142
It's my dad, he needs to see you
outside right now.

01:01:38.175 --> 01:01:39.477
Is he crazy?

01:01:41.579 --> 01:01:44.715
I mean, what could he
possibly need right now?

01:01:44.749 --> 01:01:47.184
Things are... even though,
I'm busier than anybody.

01:01:48.819 --> 01:01:49.820
I don't know.

01:01:51.489 --> 01:01:52.790
He never tells me anything.

01:01:53.791 --> 01:01:56.527
Hmm. Huh?

01:01:59.497 --> 01:02:05.169
Hey... father-daughter relationships
can be problematic, I...

01:02:07.405 --> 01:02:08.439
Okay.

01:02:10.575 --> 01:02:13.277
Why don't I go see
what he wants?

01:02:13.311 --> 01:02:14.445
Don't touch anything.

01:02:26.925 --> 01:02:29.627
Okay, I got rid of the doc
and bought you some time,

01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:32.330
but don't count on him
being gone long.

01:02:36.334 --> 01:02:37.735
I guess this is goodbye then.

01:02:41.672 --> 01:02:42.773
See you later?

01:02:42.807 --> 01:02:44.175
Count on it.

01:02:50.781 --> 01:02:52.450
Man, that girl needs a friend.

01:03:03.461 --> 01:03:05.529
Okay, locate the server.

01:03:19.477 --> 01:03:21.212
Target acquired.

01:03:23.247 --> 01:03:26.484
You may be sly, but so am I.

01:03:28.519 --> 01:03:32.556
Miss James, can we
accomplish the task before us

01:03:32.590 --> 01:03:36.394
without bad James Bond dialogue
accompanying it?

01:03:36.427 --> 01:03:39.563
Oh, come on, Chief,
where's the fun in that?

01:03:39.597 --> 01:03:43.601
This is a serious business,
but a little levity is good for us.

01:03:43.634 --> 01:03:46.437
The Trojan horse is in, Chief.

01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:48.874
Now we just need time
to unleash the worm.

01:03:54.679 --> 01:03:56.948
<i>How am I supposed to get
any work done?</i>

01:03:56.982 --> 01:03:58.449
<i>Wild goose chase.</i>

01:04:02.888 --> 01:04:06.223
Houston, we have a problem.

01:04:15.599 --> 01:04:17.969
You know, Einstein,

01:04:18.003 --> 01:04:20.337
I'm beginning to think
that Alpha Dog

01:04:20.371 --> 01:04:22.773
can't complete
this plan successfully.

01:04:26.044 --> 01:04:29.647
He wants this place
to be his doghouse.

01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:31.782
Nah, brother.

01:04:31.816 --> 01:04:34.485
I should be running
this operation, me.

01:04:36.287 --> 01:04:37.956
I wouldn't use robo-dogs.

01:04:37.989 --> 01:04:40.892
Too predictable
or unpredictable.

01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:43.627
No, I would build an army

01:04:43.661 --> 01:04:46.965
of the most loyal
and deadly of creatures.

01:04:48.699 --> 01:04:52.536
So small they could get
in and out unnoticed.

01:04:52.570 --> 01:04:56.674
So quiet,
you'd never hear them coming.

01:04:56.707 --> 01:05:00.344
And so adorable,
you'd never suspect a thing.

01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:06.550
Yes, I create an army of...

01:05:07.585 --> 01:05:09.787
robo-guinea pigs.

01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:13.724
I'd be the greatest criminal boss you'd ever seen.

01:05:13.758 --> 01:05:17.028
Can't you just imagine
it, Einstein?

01:05:17.062 --> 01:05:18.562
Einstein, huh?

01:05:19.898 --> 01:05:20.899
What?

01:05:24.903 --> 01:05:26.270
What's wrong, buddy?

01:05:27.838 --> 01:05:28.907
Hmm?

01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:30.508
Oh, you.

01:05:32.944 --> 01:05:35.379
Hot.

01:05:35.412 --> 01:05:38.382
I think I melted off my
tongue, that's gonna leave a mark.

01:05:40.085 --> 01:05:41.418
That's what I oughta create,

01:05:41.452 --> 01:05:44.455
is a weapon that could
shoot hot coffee.

01:05:44.488 --> 01:05:49.560
Everyone would be in terror of
the powerful dark roast Inferno.

01:05:51.897 --> 01:05:53.697
We're so close.

01:05:53.731 --> 01:05:55.066
Don't let him touch that drive!

01:06:17.588 --> 01:06:19.623
Oh, no, what have I done?

01:06:19.657 --> 01:06:21.960
Oh, my favorite mug.

01:06:31.903 --> 01:06:34.371
That was close.

01:06:37.175 --> 01:06:40.411
We're in business, partner.
Let's do this.

01:07:46.011 --> 01:07:49.613
Glorious day, isn't it?

01:07:49.647 --> 01:07:51.715
I would like to thank all of you
for taking time

01:07:51.749 --> 01:07:54.152
out of your busy schedules
to be here today.

01:07:54.185 --> 01:07:57.856
I assure you it will prove to be
well worth your while.

01:07:57.889 --> 01:08:01.059
I have spent considerable time and at
considerable expense, I might add...

01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:03.895
...building the perfect weapon.

01:08:03.929 --> 01:08:06.697
A weapon so insidious
that when I unleash it,

01:08:06.730 --> 01:08:11.202
all will tremble at the fearsome
bark of Alpha Dog.

01:08:13.104 --> 01:08:17.975
The only trembling you're
currently inspiring is of laughter.

01:08:22.212 --> 01:08:24.983
Ah.
Chrome Dome.

01:08:25.015 --> 01:08:27.018
Hm. Anyway...

01:08:27.051 --> 01:08:28.086
Yes, where was I?

01:08:28.118 --> 01:08:30.956
Oh, yes,
ours is a modern world.

01:08:30.988 --> 01:08:34.491
Villainy is as old
as mankind itself.

01:08:34.524 --> 01:08:36.161
So I started thinking,

01:08:36.194 --> 01:08:38.095
"What is a good old weapon

01:08:38.129 --> 01:08:41.232
that I can use to combine
with some new technology

01:08:41.265 --> 01:08:44.600
to create a greater weapon?"

01:08:44.635 --> 01:08:46.703
In that spirit,
friends and colleagues,

01:08:46.737 --> 01:08:51.774
I give you my robo-dogs.

01:08:51.809 --> 01:08:53.078
Yes.

01:09:01.185 --> 01:09:06.024
Look at them,
glorious, magnificent.

01:09:19.069 --> 01:09:23.274
Man's oldest, best-known weapon
is the famed Trojan horse.

01:09:23.308 --> 01:09:26.844
Man's best old-known friend
is the loyal dog.

01:09:28.279 --> 01:09:30.647
My genius
was to combine the two.

01:09:33.184 --> 01:09:37.022
Without further ado,
Devious, hit it.

01:09:46.965 --> 01:09:48.966
Kind of ironic, eh, Chief?

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:53.238
This Alpha dork guy
builds robot dog Trojan horses,

01:09:53.270 --> 01:09:56.041
and we use our own Trojan horse
to shut 'em down.

01:09:57.741 --> 01:09:59.310
What a tangled web we weave

01:09:59.344 --> 01:10:02.579
when first we practice
to deceive.

01:10:02.613 --> 01:10:04.115
And don't say dork, Miss James.

01:10:04.149 --> 01:10:08.719
It is a word used by bullies
and nobody likes a bully.

01:10:08.752 --> 01:10:11.022
Check it out.
I think we have lift-off.

01:10:15.026 --> 01:10:17.594
What? No. No, no.

01:10:20.365 --> 01:10:24.135
No. Okay, take it easy...

01:10:45.756 --> 01:10:47.225
I need to meditate.

01:11:06.844 --> 01:11:09.247
Devious, what...

01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:10.982
Why are my robo-dogs
going insane?

01:11:11.015 --> 01:11:13.717
I thought you said the
behavioral problems were fixed.

01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:16.187
It was. I did.

01:11:16.221 --> 01:11:18.323
I don't understand.

01:11:22.759 --> 01:11:23.862
You...

01:11:30.834 --> 01:11:33.071
Let's us take our leave.

01:11:33.104 --> 01:11:37.442
It appears Alpha Dog once again has proven
that his bark is worse than his bite.

01:11:37.475 --> 01:11:39.743
Right behind you.

01:11:39.776 --> 01:11:41.946
I made an appointment
at a day spa.

01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:43.248
My treat.

01:11:52.723 --> 01:11:56.394
Oh, no, no, please don't go,
I have a wonderful dinner planned.

01:11:56.427 --> 01:11:58.930
If this is any indication

01:11:58.963 --> 01:12:00.298
of your catering skills,

01:12:00.331 --> 01:12:02.799
I wouldn't risk
the food poisoning.

01:12:02.833 --> 01:12:05.836
What's that?
Uh. Oh, oh, this?

01:12:05.870 --> 01:12:08.907
Pfft, it's nothing at all.
Just a small, minor setback.

01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:11.910
We'll get the kinks worked out and
get it up and running in no time.

01:12:11.943 --> 01:12:13.144
Better than ever really.

01:12:13.178 --> 01:12:15.846
If you honestly believe that,

01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:18.849
than this robotic dog,
as pathetic as it is,

01:12:18.883 --> 01:12:21.818
isn't the only one
who's lost his mind.

01:12:21.852 --> 01:12:24.956
Oh.

01:12:38.069 --> 01:12:40.038
Hm. Hm.

01:12:47.312 --> 01:12:49.347
Hey, it's a heart-shaped one.

01:12:52.217 --> 01:12:55.153
I bet my mom left this
especially for you to find, huh?

01:13:00.525 --> 01:13:03.928
I guess those weird people aren't gonna
be friends with my dad anymore, huh?

01:13:06.231 --> 01:13:08.499
I bet that means we'll move off
this stupid island,

01:13:08.533 --> 01:13:10.834
and I can finally
have friends of my own.

01:13:14.105 --> 01:13:17.108
Something tells me it also means

01:13:17.141 --> 01:13:19.810
you'll have to go back
to wherever you came from.

01:13:25.183 --> 01:13:29.053
I wonder what my mom would say if she
were here to see my dad's latest disaster.

01:13:32.023 --> 01:13:34.058
She always said
he was a dreamer.

01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:45.270
Hold it right there,
you simian savior.

01:13:47.038 --> 01:13:49.907
Think I owe you
a bit of gratitude.

01:13:49.941 --> 01:13:53.311
If it wasn't for you
ruining my day today,

01:13:53.344 --> 01:13:56.114
I wouldn't have realized
what's truly important.

01:13:58.316 --> 01:14:00.885
I've been so focused
on taking over the world

01:14:00.918 --> 01:14:04.956
that I didn't realize that I had
the whole world

01:14:04.989 --> 01:14:06.524
right in front of me
the whole time.

01:14:08.993 --> 01:14:10.128
Thank you.

01:14:25.143 --> 01:14:28.212
You know, actually, your mother
called me a "schemer."

01:14:30.481 --> 01:14:32.250
Schemer with a head
full of rocks

01:14:32.283 --> 01:14:34.886
and a heart full of gold,
to tell the truth.

01:14:36.587 --> 01:14:38.289
She was 100% right.

01:14:41.592 --> 01:14:43.194
I'm sorry, pumpkin.

01:14:46.030 --> 01:14:48.566
Can a tired, old arch villain
get a hug from his daughter?

01:15:30.975 --> 01:15:32.143
Here we are.

01:15:34.345 --> 01:15:36.247
Go ahead, Sam, I'll catch up.

01:15:45.056 --> 01:15:48.059
I just wanna say I'm sorry
for the way I've been acting.

01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:50.995
I've been selfish.

01:15:52.964 --> 01:15:57.201
I know it hasn't been easy
on you. I'm sorry.

01:15:59.070 --> 01:16:01.639
I just wish things
would have stayed the same.

01:16:01.672 --> 01:16:04.142
Just you, Mom,
and me living together.

01:16:05.743 --> 01:16:10.114
Happy. Just like
when I was a little girl.

01:16:11.549 --> 01:16:13.184
We can still be happy.

01:16:13.217 --> 01:16:15.253
That doesn't have to change,
sweetie.

01:16:17.188 --> 01:16:20.191
I'm here for you,
no matter what.

01:16:20.224 --> 01:16:23.194
I'm still in the city,
and I'm just a phone call away.

01:16:24.195 --> 01:16:25.363
I know.

01:16:27.131 --> 01:16:30.234
I am so proud of you, Bondi.

01:16:30.268 --> 01:16:32.737
You're becoming
the strong young lady

01:16:32.770 --> 01:16:34.405
that I knew you would be.

01:16:35.506 --> 01:16:37.041
I love you, Dad.

01:16:37.074 --> 01:16:38.911
I love you, too, sweetie.

01:16:49.654 --> 01:16:52.056
- See you next week.
- It's a date.

01:17:07.738 --> 01:17:09.373
Johnny, have a sandwich.

01:17:09.407 --> 01:17:12.176
- Oh, here.
- Sam made 'em.

01:17:12.210 --> 01:17:15.012
Oh...
sounds, uh, yummy.

01:17:15.046 --> 01:17:17.215
Johnny,
they are messing with you.

01:17:17.248 --> 01:17:19.250
I made the sandwiches.

01:17:19.283 --> 01:17:23.454
Mm, Bondi, you never told me,
who's the secret admirer?

01:17:29.827 --> 01:17:31.596
- Oh, my.
- Hi, guys.

01:17:31.629 --> 01:17:33.564
Thanks so much
for inviting me.

01:17:33.598 --> 01:17:35.266
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

01:17:35.299 --> 01:17:36.634
Have a sandwich.

01:18:25.449 --> 01:18:27.051
What's that, Einstein?

01:18:28.352 --> 01:18:31.556
You have a dream
for world domination.

01:18:31.589 --> 01:18:34.492
Me, too.

01:18:34.525 --> 01:18:38.396
Great minds do think alike.

01:18:38.429 --> 01:18:42.400
We only need to
burst out of these walls.

01:18:42.433 --> 01:18:45.836
No, we tried your idea,
and I didn't fit in the toilet.

01:18:45.871 --> 01:18:47.071
What?

01:18:50.207 --> 01:18:56.314
Oh, that's a great idea.
Splendid, yes.

01:18:56.347 --> 01:19:00.685
Once we're escaped,
we'll take over the... the world.

01:19:00.718 --> 01:19:05.423
No, dare I say the universe?

01:19:05.456 --> 01:19:08.426
I dare. Universe.

01:19:11.295 --> 01:19:12.597
Patience, my friend.

01:19:12.630 --> 01:19:14.231
Doctor.

01:19:15.232 --> 01:19:16.734
Do I know you?

01:19:16.767 --> 01:19:18.669
No.

01:19:18.703 --> 01:19:20.338
I'm here because I have
studied your work

01:19:20.371 --> 01:19:22.306
on nano-bot technology.

01:19:24.508 --> 01:19:28.512
Nano-bot, my one true love

01:19:28.546 --> 01:19:31.716
till some monkey
turned them against me.

01:19:33.317 --> 01:19:34.819
Be it what it may.

01:19:34.852 --> 01:19:40.324
The company I represent
is most interested

01:19:40.358 --> 01:19:42.393
in getting you out of here

01:19:42.426 --> 01:19:46.497
and investing monies
in your ideas.

01:19:48.265 --> 01:19:52.136
We just need to know
what you would require from us.

01:20:00.578 --> 01:20:07.184
C... I... Ape.
