00:03.933 --> 00:06.367
>> CAITLYN: Vanity Fair is out!

00:06.367 --> 00:08.567
(cheering)

00:08.567 --> 00:10.167
Living my true identity is like

00:10.167 --> 00:11.733
somebody taking a thousand

00:11.733 --> 00:13.867
pounds off my shoulders.

00:13.867 --> 00:15.100
>> RONDA: Bathing suits.

00:15.100 --> 00:17.033
You need a sexy one for Candis.

00:17.033 --> 00:18.233
>> SPENCER: Which one's Candis?

00:18.233 --> 00:19.233
Oh!

00:19.233 --> 00:20.233
>> RONDA: And look how close she

00:20.233 --> 00:21.233
is. Look.

00:21.233 --> 00:22.233
>> CAITLYN: Candis is a

00:22.233 --> 00:23.867
beautiful woman, but as far as

00:23.867 --> 00:26.167
dating...

00:26.167 --> 00:29.467
I have absolutely no idea.

00:29.467 --> 00:30.600
>> CANDIS: You ready for this?

00:30.600 --> 00:31.833
You're gonna be good.

00:31.833 --> 00:33.067
You're gonna be good.

00:33.067 --> 00:34.300
>> CAITLYN: Is this back to the

00:34.300 --> 00:35.300
"real world"?

00:35.300 --> 00:36.800
>> CANDIS: Yeah, the real world.

00:36.800 --> 00:38.633
>> CAITLYN: Oh, God.

00:38.633 --> 00:39.933
Khloe hasn't been here,

00:39.933 --> 00:40.933
Kourtney hasn't been here.

00:40.933 --> 00:42.967
Maybe them not being around is

00:42.967 --> 00:45.467
their way of saying, "I don't

00:45.467 --> 00:46.633
know if I really agree with

00:46.633 --> 00:47.967
this."

00:47.967 --> 00:49.267
For most people dealing with

00:49.267 --> 00:50.567
this, there's a lot of families

00:50.567 --> 00:52.167
that just are torn apart by it.

00:52.167 --> 00:53.467
I don't want to tear my family

00:53.467 --> 00:55.433
apart.

01:08.867 --> 01:12.300
(insects buzzing and trilling)

01:12.300 --> 01:13.700
(sighs)

01:13.700 --> 01:15.067
Oh, God.

01:15.067 --> 01:17.433
2:57 in the morning.

01:17.433 --> 01:20.500
I just woke up in an absolute...

01:20.500 --> 01:22.300
panic.

01:22.300 --> 01:26.533
I had this...

01:26.533 --> 01:31.200
nightmare that I was in, um,

01:31.200 --> 01:33.600
a parking area, and there were

01:33.600 --> 01:36.067
so many paparazzis around me

01:36.067 --> 01:38.100
that, um,

01:38.100 --> 01:40.067
I couldn't get out.

01:40.067 --> 01:41.700
And they're, like, taking

01:41.700 --> 01:43.567
pictures and just...

01:43.567 --> 01:45.833
It was, like, horrible.

01:45.833 --> 01:47.567
Absolutely horrible.

01:47.567 --> 01:49.533
And you know that those pictures

01:49.533 --> 01:51.167
are going into the rags and

01:51.167 --> 01:52.533
they're gonna write their own

01:52.533 --> 01:55.300
stupid little story, you know?

01:55.300 --> 01:58.567
And...

01:58.567 --> 02:00.333
I-I don't want that.

02:00.333 --> 02:01.733
I got a much bigger message to

02:01.733 --> 02:03.833
get across.

02:03.833 --> 02:06.433
(sighs)

02:10.467 --> 02:12.533
(phone rings)

02:12.533 --> 02:14.200
Baby doll!

02:14.200 --> 02:15.667
>> CANDIS: Hi. This is Candis.

02:15.667 --> 02:18.533
>> CAITLYN: Candis, baby.

02:18.533 --> 02:19.800
How are you doing?

02:19.800 --> 02:21.400
>> CANDIS: I'm doing good.

02:21.400 --> 02:22.800
How are you doing?

02:22.800 --> 02:24.333
>> CAITLYN: Well, I'm just

02:24.333 --> 02:25.400
sitting here, seeing what

02:25.400 --> 02:26.467
they're saying about my

02:26.467 --> 02:27.500
children.

02:27.500 --> 02:28.500
>> CANDIS: Who?

02:28.500 --> 02:29.600
>> CAITLYN: The world.

02:29.600 --> 02:31.133
>> CANDIS (laughing): The world!

02:31.133 --> 02:32.200
>> CAITLYN: So what's up?

02:32.200 --> 02:33.900
>> CANDIS: Well, I mean, I was

02:33.900 --> 02:35.200
just thinking, you know, I

02:35.200 --> 02:36.533
talked to you about doing, like,

02:36.533 --> 02:38.067
a girls' sleepover thing, and I

02:38.067 --> 02:39.500
just wanted to know if you would

02:39.500 --> 02:41.633
want to come over and, like,

02:41.633 --> 02:43.067
order pizza or...

02:43.067 --> 02:44.133
>> CAITLYN: A sleepover?

02:44.133 --> 02:45.333
>> CANDIS: Something.

02:45.333 --> 02:46.600
Yeah, like a little sleepover.

02:46.600 --> 02:47.967
>> CAITLYN: Wow.

02:47.967 --> 02:50.300
A sleepover at Candis's.

02:50.300 --> 02:52.133
It sounds very elementary, but

02:52.133 --> 02:55.200
in a way, I'm kind of just in

02:55.200 --> 02:56.567
the beginning of this whole

02:56.567 --> 02:57.900
transition.

02:57.900 --> 02:59.200
I'm, you know, like a young

02:59.200 --> 03:00.767
little girl going through all

03:00.767 --> 03:02.333
these things.

03:02.333 --> 03:03.867
Having a sleepover with the

03:03.867 --> 03:06.067
girls actually sounds like fun.

03:06.067 --> 03:07.433
What do we do on a sleepover?

03:07.433 --> 03:09.100
You know me, I like to get to

03:09.100 --> 03:10.167
bed early.

03:10.167 --> 03:11.333
Do we have, like, pillow fights

03:11.333 --> 03:12.400
and all that stuff?

03:12.400 --> 03:14.300
>> CANDIS: (laughs) No.

03:14.300 --> 03:15.600
I invited a couple girls.

03:15.600 --> 03:17.400
They might not come because it's

03:17.400 --> 03:19.400
Trans Pride this weekend.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.667
>> CAITLYN: Um, I'm just

03:20.667 --> 03:22.200
wondering how the heck I'm ever

03:22.200 --> 03:24.667
going to get out of here, 'cause

03:24.667 --> 03:26.400
I don't want anybody following

03:26.400 --> 03:27.900
me, certainly to your house.

03:27.900 --> 03:29.533
But I'm gonna give it a shot.

03:29.533 --> 03:31.100
>> CANDIS: Okay, cool.

03:31.100 --> 03:32.367
>> CAITLYN: Till then, babe.

03:32.367 --> 03:33.867
>> CANDIS: Till then.

03:33.867 --> 03:35.967
>> CAITLYN: Okay, bye.

03:35.967 --> 03:37.933
>> CANDIS: Bye.

03:39.967 --> 03:41.900
>> CAITLYN: Court!

03:41.900 --> 03:43.100
>> COURTNEY: Yeah?

03:43.100 --> 03:44.300
>> CAITLYN: Courtney!

03:44.300 --> 03:45.533
>> COURTNEY: I'm coming.

03:45.533 --> 03:47.167
Uh-oh.

03:47.167 --> 03:48.333
>> CAITLYN: Is it too big or

03:48.333 --> 03:49.600
what, the hair?

03:49.600 --> 03:50.700
>> COURTNEY: It's never too big.

03:50.700 --> 03:51.833
It's never too big.

03:51.833 --> 03:53.600
That's not a possibility,

03:53.600 --> 03:54.933
really.

03:54.933 --> 03:56.067
>> CAITLYN: No?

03:56.067 --> 03:57.133
Can't get it too big?

03:57.133 --> 03:58.367
>> COURTNEY: No.

03:58.367 --> 03:59.367
>> CAITLYN: Oh, God.

03:59.367 --> 04:00.733
My life.

04:00.733 --> 04:01.867
>> COURTNEY: What's going on?

04:01.867 --> 04:03.133
>> CAITLYN: Well, Kim calls and

04:03.133 --> 04:05.700
says that she wants to talk.

04:05.700 --> 04:07.933
She thinks I didn't say good

04:07.933 --> 04:09.233
things about Kris, and on and on

04:09.233 --> 04:10.233
and on.

04:10.233 --> 04:11.733
I'm just, I'm like, God.

04:11.733 --> 04:13.067
>> COURTNEY: It's one of those

04:13.067 --> 04:14.233
things you have to deal with,

04:14.233 --> 04:15.633
'cause it's the kids.

04:15.633 --> 04:16.667
It's not avoidable, even though

04:16.667 --> 04:17.667
it's not easy.

04:17.667 --> 04:18.667
>> CAITLYN: You know, it's like

04:18.667 --> 04:20.233
you just can't please everybody.

04:20.233 --> 04:21.300
I thought the Vanity Fair

04:21.300 --> 04:22.833
article was so fair, especially

04:22.833 --> 04:24.067
on Kris's part.

04:24.067 --> 04:25.067
>> COURTNEY: Yeah.

04:25.067 --> 04:26.067
>> CAITLYN: I don't know, it's

04:26.067 --> 04:27.267
like they-- it's like I can't do

04:27.267 --> 04:28.067
anything right.

04:28.067 --> 04:28.900
They're always pissed off at me.

04:28.900 --> 04:29.700
>> COURTNEY: No, I mean, it's

04:29.700 --> 04:30.367
hard to please everyone.

04:30.367 --> 04:31.200
>> CAITLYN: It'll be interesting

04:31.200 --> 04:32.167
to see what she has to say.

04:32.167 --> 04:33.067
>> COURTNEY: Isn't it nice that

04:33.067 --> 04:34.133
they're all fighting over you

04:34.133 --> 04:35.067
and not...

04:35.067 --> 04:36.167
>> CAITLYN: They're all

04:36.167 --> 04:37.167
fighting over me.

04:37.167 --> 04:38.200
Okay, I'll think of it that way.

04:38.200 --> 04:39.367
They're all fighting over me.

04:39.367 --> 04:40.067
>> COURTNEY: They're all

04:40.067 --> 04:40.867
fighting over you, so...

04:40.867 --> 04:41.733
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, okay,

04:41.733 --> 04:43.700
all right.

04:46.300 --> 04:48.333
>> KIM: Hey, hey, hey.

04:48.333 --> 04:49.400
>> CAITLYN: Uh-oh, it's trouble

04:49.400 --> 04:51.067
in town.

04:51.067 --> 04:53.067
How are you doing?

04:53.067 --> 04:54.067
I can get you a water.

04:54.067 --> 04:55.067
Would you like a water?

04:55.067 --> 04:56.467
>> KIM: Oh, no, I brought one.

04:56.467 --> 04:57.600
Thank you.

04:57.600 --> 04:58.700
>> CAITLYN: You sure?

04:58.700 --> 04:59.733
>> KIM: Yes.

04:59.733 --> 05:00.800
>> CAITLYN: So...

05:00.800 --> 05:01.700
>> KIM: Oh, I'm just so

05:01.700 --> 05:02.700
exhausted.

05:02.700 --> 05:04.067
>> CAITLYN: Am I in trouble?

05:04.067 --> 05:05.200
>> KIM: Are you?

05:05.200 --> 05:06.533
Oh, yes, you're in trouble.

05:06.533 --> 05:07.533
>> CAITLYN: I'm in trouble?

05:07.533 --> 05:08.700
How could I be in trouble?

05:08.700 --> 05:09.800
Sweet, adorable, little thing

05:09.800 --> 05:11.933
like me?

05:11.933 --> 05:13.467
>> KIM: You still have a little

05:13.467 --> 05:14.600
Bruce in you.

05:14.600 --> 05:15.800
I thought Caitlyn would be a

05:15.800 --> 05:17.967
little kinder.

05:17.967 --> 05:18.967
>> CAITLYN: Really?

05:18.967 --> 05:19.967
Kinder, sweeter, gentler.

05:19.967 --> 05:20.967
>> KIM: Where do you want to go?

05:20.967 --> 05:22.233
Sit here?

05:22.233 --> 05:24.433
>> CAITLYN: I hear that...

05:24.433 --> 05:27.500
certain family members are upset

05:27.500 --> 05:28.933
with the Vanity Fair article.

05:28.933 --> 05:32.500
Khloe wrote me a very... nasty,

05:32.500 --> 05:35.667
um, text message.

05:35.667 --> 05:37.333
She felt like I said bad things

05:37.333 --> 05:38.533
about Kris.

05:38.533 --> 05:39.900
You know, you can't please

05:39.900 --> 05:41.833
everybody, and obviously

05:41.833 --> 05:43.433
there's some people in my family

05:43.433 --> 05:45.933
that I didn't please, so it's

05:45.933 --> 05:49.067
time to listen to them, see what

05:49.067 --> 05:50.367
they have to say, and hopefully

05:50.367 --> 05:52.867
defend myself.

05:52.867 --> 05:54.200
Where do we start?

05:54.200 --> 05:56.600
>> KIM: Um, let's start with

05:56.600 --> 05:57.600
Khloe.

05:57.600 --> 05:58.867
I know that she's really harsh

05:58.867 --> 06:01.233
when she communicates with you.

06:01.233 --> 06:02.500
>> CAITLYN: Wow. You want to

06:02.500 --> 06:03.567
read her texts?

06:03.567 --> 06:05.567
>> KIM: She sent them to me.

06:05.567 --> 06:07.900
Um, and that's how Khloe talks

06:07.900 --> 06:09.167
to all of us.

06:09.167 --> 06:10.167
>> CAITLYN: Right.

06:10.167 --> 06:11.633
>> KIM: So it's not just you.

06:11.633 --> 06:13.733
Khloe sees my mom upset, and so

06:13.733 --> 06:14.867
she gets defensive.

06:14.867 --> 06:16.067
>> CAITLYN: And doesn't know

06:16.067 --> 06:17.067
anything about my side of the

06:17.067 --> 06:18.067
story.

06:18.067 --> 06:19.367
>> KIM: But that's what kids do.

06:19.367 --> 06:22.433
She is gonna get defensive.

06:22.433 --> 06:23.600
>> CAITLYN: The Vanity Fair

06:23.600 --> 06:24.667
article was very interesting

06:24.667 --> 06:26.167
for me to do, because it was

06:26.167 --> 06:27.400
the first time I ever really

06:27.400 --> 06:28.767
had the opportunity to be

06:28.767 --> 06:29.867
absolutely truthful with a

06:29.867 --> 06:31.333
reporter about every aspect of

06:31.333 --> 06:32.600
my life.

06:32.600 --> 06:33.800
>> KIM: You know, I read the

06:33.800 --> 06:35.367
Vanity Fair as well, and I

06:35.367 --> 06:36.500
think that there are some

06:36.500 --> 06:38.067
things that you said that you

06:38.067 --> 06:39.633
might not realize are hurtful.

06:39.633 --> 06:40.700
>> CAITLYN: Go.

06:40.700 --> 06:41.700
>> KIM: You said Kendall and

06:41.700 --> 06:45.067
Kylie were a distraction.

06:45.067 --> 06:46.967
And so when they read that,

06:46.967 --> 06:48.400
they're gonna think...

06:48.400 --> 06:49.733
I don't know if they'll quite

06:49.733 --> 06:51.200
understand that.

06:51.200 --> 06:52.300
>> CAITLYN: You know how the

06:52.300 --> 06:53.533
print word is, yeah.

06:53.533 --> 06:55.067
>> KIM: Yeah. Then it said,

06:55.067 --> 06:57.067
"Had Kris been accepting to who

06:57.067 --> 07:00.133
I am, we still would be

07:00.133 --> 07:01.200
together."

07:01.200 --> 07:02.633
And that's the most unfair thing

07:02.633 --> 07:04.367
in the world to say.

07:04.367 --> 07:06.267
>> CAITLYN: I don't-- see, I

07:06.267 --> 07:07.367
don't look at it that way.

07:07.367 --> 07:08.433
>> KIM: You don't look at it

07:08.433 --> 07:09.600
that way, but my mom does.

07:09.600 --> 07:11.500
>> CAITLYN: Okay. Okay.

07:11.500 --> 07:12.733
It was an honest article, and

07:12.733 --> 07:14.300
sometimes when you're honest,

07:14.300 --> 07:16.567
um, you know, it can be

07:16.567 --> 07:18.700
upsetting to some people.

07:22.067 --> 07:23.067
>> KIM: But she's not...

07:23.067 --> 07:24.067
>> CAITLYN: She was fine with

07:24.067 --> 07:25.067
it.

07:25.067 --> 07:26.067
>> KIM: You are a woman now.

07:26.067 --> 07:27.067
She is not a lesbian.

07:27.067 --> 07:27.800
She does not want to be with a

07:27.800 --> 07:28.467
woman. That's not fair.

07:28.467 --> 07:29.267
>> CAITLYN: I'm not saying I

07:29.267 --> 07:29.967
would've gone this...

07:29.967 --> 07:30.967
I'm not saying I would've gone

07:30.967 --> 07:32.533
this route, but as time went on,

07:32.533 --> 07:33.667
our relationship changed

07:33.667 --> 07:35.067
drastically.

07:35.067 --> 07:37.167
In my eyes, it's like she...

07:37.167 --> 07:38.200
"I don't, I don't need him

07:38.200 --> 07:39.200
anymore."

07:39.200 --> 07:40.200
You know? "I got all the girls."

07:40.200 --> 07:41.200
>> KIM: I don't think it was

07:41.200 --> 07:42.200
that. I think, honestly...

07:42.200 --> 07:43.200
>> CAITLYN: I felt it in the way

07:43.200 --> 07:44.200
she treated me.

07:44.200 --> 07:45.833
>> KIM: Yeah.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.233
>> CAITLYN: She wanted me out of

07:47.233 --> 07:48.933
the house.

07:48.933 --> 07:50.867
She was like, (claps)

07:50.867 --> 07:51.700
"You're out of here."

07:51.700 --> 07:52.533
>> KIM: Because it wasn't meant

07:52.533 --> 07:53.233
to be.

07:53.233 --> 07:53.967
>> CAITLYN: "You're out of

07:53.967 --> 07:54.767
here."

07:54.767 --> 07:55.767
>> KIM: You should say, "Thank

07:55.767 --> 07:56.833
you, good riddance, 'cause now I

07:56.833 --> 07:58.167
am who I am and I'm happy."

07:58.167 --> 07:59.167
>> CAITLYN: Okay, but then don't

07:59.167 --> 08:00.833
come back and be so, you know,

08:00.833 --> 08:02.733
emotional over the breakup.

08:02.733 --> 08:03.733
She wanted me out.

08:03.733 --> 08:05.167
>> KIM: But you can't fault her.

08:05.167 --> 08:06.633
That obviously means she really

08:06.633 --> 08:08.333
loved you and cherished your 25

08:08.333 --> 08:10.300
years together as a family.

08:10.300 --> 08:11.533
>> CAITLYN: And I loved her,

08:11.533 --> 08:14.533
too.

08:14.533 --> 08:15.433
>> KIM: Towards the end, it

08:15.433 --> 08:16.200
never would've worked, and

08:16.200 --> 08:17.267
that's fine, and she's okay

08:17.267 --> 08:18.100
with that.

08:18.100 --> 08:20.467
You both agree that the end was

08:20.467 --> 08:22.067
bad.

08:22.067 --> 08:24.567
You guys were in a bad place.

08:24.567 --> 08:26.133
But if I was with someone for 25

08:26.133 --> 08:27.700
years, I would try to look for

08:27.700 --> 08:29.833
the positive things and just end

08:29.833 --> 08:33.067
it on a good note.

08:33.067 --> 08:34.133
You said, "Oh, Kris mistreated

08:34.133 --> 08:35.133
me."

08:35.133 --> 08:36.233
It sounded like she beat the

08:36.233 --> 08:37.067
(bleep) out of you.

08:37.067 --> 08:37.933
>> CAITLYN: Take it easy.

08:37.933 --> 08:38.600
Don't go...

08:38.600 --> 08:39.300
>> KIM: You could've had a

08:39.300 --> 08:40.067
little bit more respect, but I

08:40.067 --> 08:41.067
think...

08:41.067 --> 08:42.100
>> CAITLYN: Don't go... I can

08:42.100 --> 08:43.300
see where you're trying to go

08:43.300 --> 08:44.067
here.

08:44.067 --> 08:45.800
Don't go there.

08:45.800 --> 08:47.067
>> KIM: You got the fame, but

08:47.067 --> 08:49.067
you're losing your family.

08:53.067 --> 08:54.167
>> CANDIS: Oh, my God, you have

08:54.167 --> 08:56.367
to go look in the mirror here.

08:56.367 --> 08:58.100
How gorgeous is that?

08:58.100 --> 08:59.367
It's hot.

08:59.367 --> 09:02.067
(laughs) It's a little low.

09:02.067 --> 09:03.367
It needs a strap.

09:03.367 --> 09:05.967
Now, this is the look.

09:05.967 --> 09:06.967
>> CAITLYN: We really haven't

09:06.967 --> 09:07.967
had a chance to sit down and

09:07.967 --> 09:09.300
talk after you sent me those

09:09.300 --> 09:11.100
really tough texts.

09:11.100 --> 09:12.333
>> KHLOE: We don't care if you

09:12.333 --> 09:13.267
want to transition, but we don't

09:13.267 --> 09:14.267
think...

09:14.267 --> 09:14.933
>> CAITLYN: Mm-hmm.

09:14.933 --> 09:16.067
>> KHLOE: ...that that entails

09:16.067 --> 09:17.467
you speaking negatively about my

09:17.467 --> 09:18.467
mom.

09:18.467 --> 09:19.500
And then when you try to tell me

09:19.500 --> 09:20.300
that I don't know what I'm

09:20.300 --> 09:21.100
talking about because I...

09:21.100 --> 09:21.933
>> CAITLYN: Because you don't

09:21.933 --> 09:23.900
know.

09:27.067 --> 09:27.767
>> KIM: You could've had a

09:27.767 --> 09:28.767
little bit more respect, but I

09:28.767 --> 09:29.433
think if you only had

09:29.433 --> 09:30.100
positive things to say...

09:30.100 --> 09:30.933
>> CAITLYN: Don't go...

09:30.933 --> 09:31.733
I can see where you're trying to

09:31.733 --> 09:32.400
go here.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.400
Don't go there.

09:34.400 --> 09:35.967
>> KIM: You've got the fame, but

09:35.967 --> 09:39.167
you're losing your family.

09:39.167 --> 09:40.433
>> CAITLYN: Honestly, I want

09:40.433 --> 09:41.833
nothing but good to come out of

09:41.833 --> 09:42.900
this.

09:42.900 --> 09:43.833
I want nothing but good to come

09:43.833 --> 09:44.867
out of my relationship with all

09:44.867 --> 09:45.967
my kids.

09:45.967 --> 09:47.400
>> KIM: You look amazing, it's

09:47.400 --> 09:48.667
your time, but you don't have

09:48.667 --> 09:51.400
to bash us on your way up.

09:53.433 --> 09:54.600
>> CAITLYN: I tried to be as

09:54.600 --> 09:56.467
honest as I could in how I felt.

09:56.467 --> 09:57.267
>> KIM: Yeah.

09:57.267 --> 09:58.233
>> CAITLYN: Is everybody,

09:58.233 --> 10:00.067
especially Kris, reading too

10:00.067 --> 10:02.033
much into every little word

10:02.033 --> 10:03.367
that's out there?

10:03.367 --> 10:06.433
I have never once ever tried to

10:06.433 --> 10:08.700
do anything that would hurt her.

10:08.700 --> 10:10.700
I'm so upset that everybody kind

10:10.700 --> 10:13.067
of is taking things the wrong

10:13.067 --> 10:15.000
way, everybody's on edge.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.800
She's feeling bad, I feel bad.

10:16.800 --> 10:17.633
>> KIM: No matter what, we're a

10:17.633 --> 10:18.733
family.

10:18.733 --> 10:20.500
And even though you and my mom

10:20.500 --> 10:21.800
aren't together anymore and

10:21.800 --> 10:23.633
there's this full separation, we

10:23.633 --> 10:25.367
still need to have a united

10:25.367 --> 10:27.100
front and understand each other.

10:27.100 --> 10:28.100
>> CAITLYN: I get that.

10:28.100 --> 10:29.067
I get that.

10:29.067 --> 10:30.333
>> KIM: So just mend it, so we

10:30.333 --> 10:31.333
can all...

10:31.333 --> 10:32.300
>> CAITLYN: Move on.

10:32.300 --> 10:33.300
>> KIM: ...move on and have

10:33.300 --> 10:34.267
unity.

10:34.267 --> 10:35.033
>> CAITLYN: Do we start with

10:35.033 --> 10:35.800
publicly mending it?

10:35.800 --> 10:36.900
Do you think a tweet?

10:36.900 --> 10:37.733
>> KIM: I think so.

10:37.733 --> 10:38.867
I mean, I think if you publicly

10:38.867 --> 10:39.800
acknowledged, it would, it

10:39.800 --> 10:41.200
would, you know, help her

10:41.200 --> 10:42.933
spirits, all your kids' spirits.

10:42.933 --> 10:43.967
>> CAITLYN: I-I get that.

10:43.967 --> 10:44.733
>> KIM: So I think to make

10:44.733 --> 10:45.667
everything good with everybody,

10:45.667 --> 10:46.333
if-if the kids...

10:46.333 --> 10:47.000
>> CAITLYN: But I can't

10:47.000 --> 10:47.667
apologize.

10:47.667 --> 10:48.900
I can't apologize unless they

10:48.900 --> 10:52.000
come out here.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.500
Nobody's come out.

10:53.500 --> 10:54.933
Kourtney hasn't made a move at

10:54.933 --> 10:55.800
all.

10:55.800 --> 10:57.133
Obviously, Khloe hasn't come

10:57.133 --> 10:58.033
close.

10:58.033 --> 11:00.067
I feel so isolated out here.

11:00.067 --> 11:01.300
You know, it's like all of a

11:01.300 --> 11:02.900
sudden there's this wall that's

11:02.900 --> 11:05.767
up there.

11:05.767 --> 11:07.333
>> KIM: I think that you just

11:07.333 --> 11:10.100
have to get the family unity

11:10.100 --> 11:13.533
going again.

11:13.533 --> 11:14.300
>> CAITLYN: I just want

11:14.300 --> 11:15.967
everybody to be happy.

11:15.967 --> 11:18.667
I love, love, love all my kids.

11:18.667 --> 11:19.867
I wish you guys were here every

11:19.867 --> 11:21.833
damn day.

11:25.067 --> 11:27.067
(seagulls squawking)

11:32.533 --> 11:34.333
I gotta figure out what I should

11:34.333 --> 11:36.267
take to a slumber party.

11:36.267 --> 11:37.267
Hold on.

11:37.267 --> 11:38.300
>> COURTNEY (laughs): Whose

11:38.300 --> 11:39.700
slumber party are you going to?

11:39.700 --> 11:40.500
Ooh!

11:40.500 --> 11:41.767
(Caitlyn laughs)

11:41.767 --> 11:42.733
Oh, what kind of slumber party

11:42.733 --> 11:43.867
is this?

11:43.867 --> 11:44.667
>> CAITLYN: Candis.

11:44.667 --> 11:45.667
Well, yeah, I don't know.

11:45.667 --> 11:46.633
You know who gave me that?

11:46.633 --> 11:47.667
>> COURTNEY: Who?

11:47.667 --> 11:48.567
>> CAITLYN: Kris.

11:48.567 --> 11:49.500
>> COURTNEY: She gave it to you

11:49.500 --> 11:50.400
or you stole it?

11:50.400 --> 11:51.133
>> CAITLYN: No, uh, no.

11:51.133 --> 11:52.067
She gave it to me.

11:52.067 --> 11:53.267
>> COURTNEY: That's interesting.

11:53.267 --> 11:54.400
>> CAITLYN: She gave it to me.

11:54.400 --> 11:56.500
What about that?

11:56.500 --> 11:57.400
>> COURTNEY: I think you should

11:57.400 --> 11:58.200
bring that, but I think you

11:58.200 --> 11:59.400
should bring other options in

11:59.400 --> 12:00.467
case you want to have, like, a

12:00.467 --> 12:01.600
lingerie dress-up.

12:01.600 --> 12:02.633
'Cause sometimes you do that

12:02.633 --> 12:03.700
just for fun.

12:03.700 --> 12:05.667
>> CAITLYN: God.

12:05.667 --> 12:06.833
>> COURTNEY: So is this just you

12:06.833 --> 12:08.100
and Candis or are there other

12:08.100 --> 12:09.267
girls coming?

12:09.267 --> 12:10.633
>> CAITLYN: Well, right now I

12:10.633 --> 12:11.900
think the only one she has firm

12:11.900 --> 12:14.200
is the two of us.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.367
>> COURTNEY: Hmm.

12:15.367 --> 12:16.667
>> CAITLYN: Don't even go there.

12:16.667 --> 12:17.467
>> COURTNEY: That's my dream.

12:17.467 --> 12:18.133
>> CAITLYN: Are you telling

12:18.133 --> 12:20.467
me...? Don't even go there.

12:20.467 --> 12:21.267
>> COURTNEY: Okay, so I think we

12:21.267 --> 12:22.067
should go back to the white.

12:22.067 --> 12:22.833
>> CAITLYN: Get your mind out of

12:22.833 --> 12:23.500
the gutter.

12:23.500 --> 12:24.200
>> COURTNEY: We should go back

12:24.200 --> 12:24.867
to the white.

12:24.867 --> 12:25.867
>> CAITLYN: What about...

12:25.867 --> 12:27.633
>> COURTNEY: Ooh-- oh.

12:27.633 --> 12:29.100
I like that.

12:29.100 --> 12:30.100
Maybe you'll go with black

12:30.100 --> 12:30.967
'cause you're feeling a little

12:30.967 --> 12:31.833
naughty.

12:31.833 --> 12:33.500
(Caitlyn laughs)

12:33.500 --> 12:34.600
>> CAITLYN: A slumber party.

12:34.600 --> 12:35.900
Kind of sounds like fun, but I

12:35.900 --> 12:37.733
have no idea what goes on,

12:37.733 --> 12:38.833
I don't know if I'll feel

12:38.833 --> 12:40.167
comfortable.

12:40.167 --> 12:41.133
You know, there's just a lot of

12:41.133 --> 12:42.633
questions.

12:42.633 --> 12:44.233
What happens at a slumber party?

12:44.233 --> 12:45.733
>> COURTNEY: You, like, pillow

12:45.733 --> 12:47.200
fight, you tell ghost stories.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.233
>> CAITLYN: Pillow fight!

12:48.233 --> 12:49.067
>> COURTNEY: You compare your

12:49.067 --> 12:50.067
boob sizes.

12:50.067 --> 12:51.133
>> CAITLYN: Ew, God.

12:51.133 --> 12:52.133
>> COURTNEY: You never know

12:52.133 --> 12:53.100
where the night's gonna go with

12:53.100 --> 12:53.900
Candis.

12:53.900 --> 12:54.900
>> CAITLYN: You just never quite

12:54.900 --> 12:55.900
know.

12:55.900 --> 12:56.900
>> COURTNEY: Never know who's

12:56.900 --> 12:57.900
gonna not show up.

12:57.900 --> 12:58.767
>> CAITLYN: That's true.

12:58.767 --> 12:59.767
>> COURTNEY: And you leave you

12:59.767 --> 13:00.833
two alone. (chuckles)

13:00.833 --> 13:02.800
>> CAITLYN: True. Oh, God.

13:04.867 --> 13:08.467
(Caitlyn humming)

13:08.467 --> 13:10.133
(Candis laughs)

13:10.133 --> 13:10.833
>> CANDIS: You made it up the

13:10.833 --> 13:11.833
stairs.

13:11.833 --> 13:13.133
>> CAITLYN: God, I'm exhausted.

13:13.133 --> 13:13.933
>> CANDIS: Come here.

13:13.933 --> 13:15.067
>> CAITLYN: Hi, baby. Here I am.

13:15.067 --> 13:15.900
>> CANDIS: Hi, honey.

13:15.900 --> 13:16.967
Let me get that for you.

13:16.967 --> 13:18.100
(dog barks)

13:18.100 --> 13:19.333
That's Samson and this is

13:19.333 --> 13:20.367
Delilah.

13:20.367 --> 13:21.433
>> CAITLYN: Well, nice to meet

13:21.433 --> 13:22.367
you guys.

13:22.367 --> 13:23.300
>> CANDIS: You look gorge.

13:23.300 --> 13:24.533
>> CAITLYN: So do you, babe.

13:24.533 --> 13:25.400
(Candis laughs)

13:25.400 --> 13:26.067
>> CANDIS: We're in caj.

13:26.067 --> 13:27.067
>> CAITLYN: We're very caj.

13:27.067 --> 13:27.767
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

13:27.767 --> 13:29.467
Do you want some wine?

13:29.467 --> 13:30.300
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, why not?

13:30.300 --> 13:31.467
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

13:31.467 --> 13:33.600
I say that we open up a little

13:33.600 --> 13:34.467
Santa Margarita.

13:34.467 --> 13:35.867
>> CAITLYN: Oh!

13:35.867 --> 13:36.800
Love it.

13:36.800 --> 13:37.500
>> CANDIS: What do you think?

13:37.500 --> 13:38.433
Okay.

13:38.433 --> 13:39.433
>> CAITLYN: Perfect.

13:39.433 --> 13:40.733
My God, look at that picture of

13:40.733 --> 13:41.567
yourself.

13:41.567 --> 13:42.600
>> CANDIS (laughing): I know, I

13:42.600 --> 13:43.833
can't help it.

13:43.833 --> 13:45.267
>> CAITLYN: So who's coming

13:45.267 --> 13:46.267
over?

13:46.267 --> 13:47.533
>> CANDIS: I think, you know,

13:47.533 --> 13:48.567
some girls are going to try to

13:48.567 --> 13:49.500
come.

13:49.500 --> 13:50.233
>> CAITLYN: Right.

13:50.233 --> 13:51.133
>> CANDIS: If not, like...

13:51.133 --> 13:52.333
>> CAITLYN: Whoever shows up.

13:52.333 --> 13:53.067
>> CANDIS: You know, whoever

13:53.067 --> 13:53.700
shows up, they show up.

13:53.700 --> 13:54.433
>> CAITLYN: We got our own wine.

13:54.433 --> 13:55.100
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

13:55.100 --> 13:55.767
>> CAITLYN: Absolutely.

13:55.767 --> 13:56.500
>> CANDIS: We have our wine, we

13:56.500 --> 13:57.733
have our pizza.

13:57.733 --> 13:58.633
Well, cheers.

13:58.633 --> 13:59.367
>> CAITLYN: I know.

13:59.367 --> 14:00.667
>> CANDIS: I can't believe I got

14:00.667 --> 14:01.433
you here.

14:01.433 --> 14:02.167
>> CAITLYN: My God, I'm just

14:02.167 --> 14:03.200
such a free spirit.

14:03.200 --> 14:04.200
>> CANDIS: I know it's hard,

14:04.200 --> 14:05.433
'cause I'm the same way.

14:05.433 --> 14:06.867
I like to just recluse a little

14:06.867 --> 14:08.367
bit, but I know how important it

14:08.367 --> 14:09.500
is...

14:09.500 --> 14:10.600
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

14:10.600 --> 14:11.700
>> CANDIS: ...to just spread

14:11.700 --> 14:12.567
your wings and take off.

14:12.567 --> 14:13.867
>> CAITLYN: I know. I know.

14:13.867 --> 14:15.700
I'm worried about somebody

14:15.700 --> 14:16.767
approaching me and how to handle

14:16.767 --> 14:17.900
them.

14:17.900 --> 14:18.800
>> CANDIS: Really?

14:18.800 --> 14:20.933
>> CAITLYN: Um... yeah.

14:20.933 --> 14:22.400
>> CANDIS: Would you like to go

14:22.400 --> 14:24.267
out on a date?

14:24.267 --> 14:25.833
>> CAITLYN: Yeah. Would I?

14:25.833 --> 14:26.567
>> CANDIS: Like, if somebody

14:26.567 --> 14:27.800
walked up to you who was

14:27.800 --> 14:29.333
beautiful and I was like, "Would

14:29.333 --> 14:31.500
you like to go out on a date

14:31.500 --> 14:32.333
sometime?"

14:32.333 --> 14:34.700
What would you say?

14:34.700 --> 14:35.733
>> CAITLYN: You're making

14:35.733 --> 14:37.467
this... so tough.

14:37.467 --> 14:38.767
What would I say?

14:38.767 --> 14:40.233
>> CANDIS: Cait, she's

14:40.233 --> 14:42.300
discovering this new life-- with

14:42.300 --> 14:44.067
me, which is kind of crazy, you

14:44.067 --> 14:45.200
know?

14:45.200 --> 14:47.167
Like, I'm suddenly going along

14:47.167 --> 14:48.533
this journey with her and this

14:48.533 --> 14:50.633
is the beginning of her process.

14:50.633 --> 14:52.267
And I'm really enjoying spending

14:52.267 --> 14:54.667
time with her and she's open to

14:54.667 --> 14:57.233
everything, which I really love.

14:57.233 --> 14:58.500
So if you had a dream dress to

14:58.500 --> 15:00.400
wear, what would it be?

15:00.400 --> 15:02.333
>> CAITLYN: I like elegant,

15:02.333 --> 15:05.200
flowing, um...

15:05.200 --> 15:06.933
Color? I don't know.

15:06.933 --> 15:07.933
>> CANDIS: I have a whole closet

15:07.933 --> 15:09.433
up there.

15:09.433 --> 15:10.500
So you can start testing out

15:10.500 --> 15:11.733
your theories.

15:11.733 --> 15:12.567
>> CAITLYN: My God, yeah, I

15:12.567 --> 15:13.367
know.

15:13.367 --> 15:14.200
And actually, we're probably

15:14.200 --> 15:15.400
very close in size.

15:15.400 --> 15:16.233
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

15:16.233 --> 15:17.067
>> CAITLYN: You're bigger in the

15:17.067 --> 15:17.800
ass.

15:17.800 --> 15:18.667
>> CANDIS: I am... (laughs)

15:18.667 --> 15:19.633
I am bigger in the ass, that's

15:19.633 --> 15:20.633
for sure.

15:20.633 --> 15:21.433
>> CAITLYN: Okay, let's go look.

15:21.433 --> 15:22.233
>> CANDIS: Okay, let's go look.

15:22.233 --> 15:23.067
>> CAITLYN: Let's go check it

15:23.067 --> 15:24.067
out.

15:24.067 --> 15:25.167
(crickets chirping)

15:25.167 --> 15:26.367
My God, look at all this stuff.

15:26.367 --> 15:27.367
>> CANDIS: I know!

15:27.367 --> 15:29.067
It's so good.

15:29.067 --> 15:30.567
>> CAITLYN: Wait a second.

15:30.567 --> 15:31.733
>> CANDIS: See, this is a

15:31.733 --> 15:34.067
number. (inhales)

15:34.067 --> 15:34.767
>> CAITLYN: See, that would get

15:34.767 --> 15:35.600
you in trouble right there.

15:35.600 --> 15:36.533
>> CANDIS: No, this would be so

15:36.533 --> 15:37.367
good on you.

15:37.367 --> 15:38.533
It is so flattering.

15:38.533 --> 15:39.667
And this would be, like,

15:39.667 --> 15:40.633
elegant.

15:40.633 --> 15:41.667
Like, "I'm going to..."

15:41.667 --> 15:42.367
You know.

15:42.367 --> 15:43.233
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

15:43.233 --> 15:44.400
Yes.

15:44.400 --> 15:45.300
>> CANDIS: I want to see you in

15:45.300 --> 15:46.300
this.

15:46.300 --> 15:48.600
Like, I really kind of do.

15:48.600 --> 15:50.267
It would look so good on you.

15:50.267 --> 15:51.900
Will you put it on?

15:51.900 --> 15:53.300
And there's this version.

15:53.300 --> 15:54.600
I have two versions, that and

15:54.600 --> 15:55.967
this is the more sheer version.

15:55.967 --> 15:57.100
>> CAITLYN: Oh, my God!

15:57.100 --> 15:57.933
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

15:57.933 --> 15:58.700
>> CAITLYN: What do you wear

15:58.700 --> 15:59.433
under that?

15:59.433 --> 16:00.200
>> CANDIS: Nothing.

16:00.200 --> 16:01.067
>> CAITLYN: Oh, God.

16:01.067 --> 16:01.800
>> CANDIS: It doesn't show.

16:01.800 --> 16:03.067
When your, when your nipples are

16:03.067 --> 16:04.167
pressed up against it, it

16:04.167 --> 16:04.933
doesn't show a nipple at all.

16:04.933 --> 16:05.733
>> CAITLYN: Really, it doesn't,

16:05.733 --> 16:06.500
they don't show any nipples?

16:06.500 --> 16:07.233
>> CANDIS: No. Yeah, 'cause

16:07.233 --> 16:08.500
there's some pink in there.

16:08.500 --> 16:09.467
>> CAITLYN: Mm-hmm.

16:09.467 --> 16:10.600
(Candis laughs)

16:10.600 --> 16:11.667
I will try it on.

16:11.667 --> 16:12.500
>> CANDIS: Try it on.

16:12.500 --> 16:13.600
I'm gonna pull some outfits for

16:13.600 --> 16:15.467
you.

16:15.467 --> 16:16.933
(gasps)

16:16.933 --> 16:18.067
You don't like it?

16:18.067 --> 16:18.833
>> CAITLYN: I love it.

16:18.833 --> 16:19.833
>> CANDIS: Okay, it looks really

16:19.833 --> 16:20.667
good.

16:20.667 --> 16:21.600
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

16:21.600 --> 16:22.767
>> CANDIS: It fits really good,

16:22.767 --> 16:23.567
right?

16:23.567 --> 16:24.433
>> CAITLYN: The butt? Working?

16:24.433 --> 16:25.933
The butt working?

16:25.933 --> 16:26.800
>> CANDIS: The butt is working.

16:26.800 --> 16:27.667
Yes.

16:27.667 --> 16:28.633
Wait, here.

16:28.633 --> 16:30.233
>> CAITLYN: Oh, my God.

16:30.233 --> 16:31.067
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

16:31.067 --> 16:32.367
(laughs)

16:32.367 --> 16:33.600
We'll be right back.

16:33.600 --> 16:34.433
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, we'll be right

16:34.433 --> 16:35.167
back.

16:35.167 --> 16:36.067
>> CANDIS: Oh, I like the bra.

16:36.067 --> 16:37.067
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

16:37.067 --> 16:38.067
Get 'em up there!

16:38.067 --> 16:39.167
>> CANDIS: Get 'em up there.

16:39.167 --> 16:40.200
Oh, my God, you have to go look

16:40.200 --> 16:42.067
in the mirror here.

16:42.067 --> 16:44.500
How gorgeous is that?

16:44.500 --> 16:45.833
It's hot.

16:45.833 --> 16:47.833
(laughs)

16:47.833 --> 16:49.100
It's a little low.

16:49.100 --> 16:49.867
It needs a strap.

16:49.867 --> 16:50.700
>> CAITLYN: Yes, it needs, like,

16:50.700 --> 16:51.500
a wide strap there.

16:51.500 --> 16:52.233
>> CANDIS: Well, and it shows...

16:52.233 --> 16:52.900
it shows a lot of...

16:52.900 --> 16:53.633
>> CAITLYN: It kind of shows--

16:53.633 --> 16:55.233
yes.

16:55.233 --> 16:55.967
>> CANDIS: Now, this is the

16:55.967 --> 16:56.733
look.

16:56.733 --> 16:57.567
This is New York City.

16:57.567 --> 16:58.600
See? How good?

16:58.600 --> 17:01.400
Yes, I love it!

17:01.400 --> 17:02.600
>> CAITLYN: I love these little

17:02.600 --> 17:03.633
slumber parties.

17:03.633 --> 17:04.533
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

17:04.533 --> 17:08.533
(crickets chirping)

17:08.533 --> 17:09.967
(doorbell rings)

17:09.967 --> 17:10.700
(door opens)

17:10.700 --> 17:11.600
Hi, gorge.

17:11.600 --> 17:12.367
>> JEN: Hi.

17:12.367 --> 17:13.400
>> CANDIS: Hi.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.333
>> JEN: How are you?

17:14.333 --> 17:15.433
>> CAITLYN: I haven't seen you

17:15.433 --> 17:16.500
forever.

17:16.500 --> 17:17.167
>> JEN: Forever.

17:17.167 --> 17:17.833
How are you?

17:17.833 --> 17:18.600
>> CAITLYN: I know.

17:18.600 --> 17:19.367
>> JEN: Good to see you.

17:19.367 --> 17:20.067
>> CAITLYN: And you brought

17:20.067 --> 17:20.700
along a friend.

17:20.700 --> 17:21.433
>> JEN: I want to introduce you

17:21.433 --> 17:22.133
two.

17:22.133 --> 17:23.233
Caitlyn, this is Kate.

17:23.233 --> 17:23.967
>> KATE: Hello.

17:23.967 --> 17:24.700
>> CAITLYN: How are you doing?

17:24.700 --> 17:25.967
Probably one of the most

17:25.967 --> 17:28.833
experienced people in this field

17:28.833 --> 17:30.267
is Kate Bornstein.

17:30.267 --> 17:32.233
She's written books, she's been

17:32.233 --> 17:34.433
an advocate for the last 30, 40

17:34.433 --> 17:35.467
years.

17:35.467 --> 17:37.333
She has seen so many transitions

17:37.333 --> 17:39.333
take place and she is just an

17:39.333 --> 17:41.433
absolute wealth of information.

17:41.433 --> 17:44.700
I am so excited to meet her.

17:44.700 --> 17:45.533
>> KATE: You and I share

17:45.533 --> 17:46.533
timelines.

17:46.533 --> 17:47.200
We go like this.

17:47.200 --> 17:48.067
>> CAITLYN: Oh, God, let's sit

17:48.067 --> 17:48.667
down.

17:48.667 --> 17:49.433
(laughter)

17:49.433 --> 17:50.200
>> JEN: Let's get right in.

17:50.200 --> 17:50.933
>> CAITLYN: Let's sit down.

17:50.933 --> 17:52.367
We need to talk.

17:52.367 --> 17:53.367
>> JEN: Yes. The first time I

17:53.367 --> 17:54.700
met Kate was at an event in

17:54.700 --> 17:55.700
Chicago.

17:55.700 --> 17:57.367
A lot of her message is-is aimed

17:57.367 --> 17:59.067
at that population, people who

17:59.067 --> 18:00.433
are really struggling, and I

18:00.433 --> 18:01.767
remember what really struck me

18:01.767 --> 18:03.433
was, there was this event in

18:03.433 --> 18:04.767
Chicago, and then she sat down

18:04.767 --> 18:06.433
afterwards, and there was just a

18:06.433 --> 18:08.433
long line of people, and, like,

18:08.433 --> 18:10.100
an hour and a half later, Kate

18:10.100 --> 18:11.100
was the last person to leave

18:11.100 --> 18:12.433
that room, after everyone had

18:12.433 --> 18:14.100
come forth and kind of poured

18:14.100 --> 18:16.433
out their hearts to this woman.

18:16.433 --> 18:17.767
And there's not many people who

18:17.767 --> 18:19.100
would do that for us.

18:19.100 --> 18:20.100
>> CAITLYN: The love that I've

18:20.100 --> 18:21.433
seen and the goodness that I've

18:21.433 --> 18:22.767
seen come out of this has

18:22.767 --> 18:24.767
been... been great.

18:24.767 --> 18:26.100
And it's because of people like

18:26.100 --> 18:27.433
yourself, you know, that have

18:27.433 --> 18:29.100
really struggled for years, and,

18:29.100 --> 18:30.433
you know, it's made a difference

18:30.433 --> 18:32.767
for everybody, you know?

18:32.767 --> 18:34.100
>> KATE: Well, you've joined the

18:34.100 --> 18:35.433
club.

18:35.433 --> 18:38.100
Your mind must be fried.

18:38.100 --> 18:39.433
>> CAITLYN: It's just, it's

18:39.433 --> 18:41.100
overwhelming to me, so it's been

18:41.100 --> 18:42.433
a fun journey for me.

18:42.433 --> 18:43.767
I've learned so much in the

18:43.767 --> 18:45.433
last, you know, month, six

18:45.433 --> 18:46.433
weeks.

18:46.433 --> 18:47.433
>> KATE: Have you been dealing

18:47.433 --> 18:49.767
well with the freak factor?

18:49.767 --> 18:52.767
'Cause... that's... that's a

18:52.767 --> 18:56.433
fact.

18:56.433 --> 18:58.767
We are freaks in... to a lot of

18:58.767 --> 19:00.800
the world.

19:05.167 --> 19:06.833
>> CAITLYN: Um...

19:06.833 --> 19:08.500
I really feel like what we're

19:08.500 --> 19:10.500
really trying to do here is kind

19:10.500 --> 19:12.833
of normalize this as much as we

19:12.833 --> 19:14.500
possibly can.

19:14.500 --> 19:16.167
>> KATE: Well, part of the

19:16.167 --> 19:17.833
reason you want to is 'cause you

19:17.833 --> 19:19.800
don't want to be a freak.

19:27.167 --> 19:28.500
>> CAITLYN: Um...

19:28.500 --> 19:30.167
I really feel like what we're

19:30.167 --> 19:32.167
really trying to do here is kind

19:32.167 --> 19:34.500
of normalize this as much as we

19:34.500 --> 19:35.833
possibly can.

19:35.833 --> 19:37.833
>> KATE: Well, part of the

19:37.833 --> 19:39.500
reason you want to is 'cause you

19:39.500 --> 19:42.500
don't want to be a freak.

19:42.500 --> 19:44.167
And who does?

19:44.167 --> 19:45.167
That's what stopped me for

19:45.167 --> 19:46.167
years and years from moving

19:46.167 --> 19:47.167
forward.

19:47.167 --> 19:48.500
>> CAITLYN: Yeah. Yeah.

19:48.500 --> 19:49.833
Oh, I agree.

19:49.833 --> 19:51.833
You are gonna have that segment

19:51.833 --> 19:53.167
of the population that's gonna

19:53.167 --> 19:54.500
say: yes, this is the biggest

19:54.500 --> 19:55.500
freak show I've ever seen in

19:55.500 --> 19:56.500
life.

19:56.500 --> 19:57.500
Especially for me to do

19:57.500 --> 19:58.500
something like that.

19:58.500 --> 19:59.500
But as time...

19:59.500 --> 20:00.500
>> KATE: Well, going from

20:00.500 --> 20:02.167
hyper-guy to hyper-girl, yeah.

20:02.167 --> 20:03.167
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, to...

20:03.167 --> 20:04.500
Yeah, hyper-girl, you know?

20:04.500 --> 20:05.833
>> KATE: (gasps) Wink at me one

20:05.833 --> 20:06.833
more time and you're in trouble,

20:06.833 --> 20:07.833
missy.

20:07.833 --> 20:10.167
(everyone laughs)

20:10.167 --> 20:11.500
>> CAITLYN: I'll remember that.

20:11.500 --> 20:12.833
Thanks for the warning, babe.

20:12.833 --> 20:13.833
>> JEN: Cait... Cait is this

20:13.833 --> 20:14.833
community's biggest flirt.

20:14.833 --> 20:15.833
Just...

20:15.833 --> 20:16.833
>> CAITLYN: Yeah. Yeah.

20:16.833 --> 20:17.833
>> JEN: Which we love.

20:17.833 --> 20:18.833
We love it.

20:18.833 --> 20:20.500
>> CAITLYN: But, um, how I

20:20.500 --> 20:22.167
present myself to the world,

20:22.167 --> 20:24.167
okay, is important to me.

20:24.167 --> 20:25.167
>> KATE: Of course.

20:25.167 --> 20:26.167
>> CAITLYN: You know?

20:26.167 --> 20:28.833
So how do you see a way to get

20:28.833 --> 20:32.167
over the freak factor?

20:32.167 --> 20:33.833
>> KATE: The only way I've

20:33.833 --> 20:36.833
gotten through it is to own it.

20:36.833 --> 20:38.833
Owning the "freakdom" with

20:38.833 --> 20:40.833
heart...

20:40.833 --> 20:41.833
>> CAITLYN: Right.

20:41.833 --> 20:42.833
>> KATE: ...and going: yeah, I'm

20:42.833 --> 20:44.500
a freak, and I love you, and I

20:44.500 --> 20:46.167
won't hurt you, and I won't be

20:46.167 --> 20:47.500
mean to you...

20:47.500 --> 20:48.500
>> CAITLYN: Right.

20:48.500 --> 20:49.500
>> KATE: ...and you have my word

20:49.500 --> 20:50.500
on that.

20:50.500 --> 20:53.500
So that's how it's got to go.

20:53.500 --> 20:56.167
I have problems with the word

20:56.167 --> 20:57.833
"ally."

20:57.833 --> 21:00.567
Um, many people think, "I accept

21:00.567 --> 21:03.900
you, uh, therefore I'm an ally."

21:03.900 --> 21:05.233
No, you're not.

21:05.233 --> 21:07.233
No, you're an accepting person.

21:07.233 --> 21:10.567
"Ally" means you ask me what I

21:10.567 --> 21:14.567
need, I tell you, and you tell

21:14.567 --> 21:18.233
me what or how much of that you

21:18.233 --> 21:19.900
can actually supply.

21:19.900 --> 21:22.233
If I say I need help getting

21:22.233 --> 21:24.900
through that crowd of people who

21:24.900 --> 21:27.567
think I'm a freak, and I need

21:27.567 --> 21:30.567
you to be a bodyguard, that

21:30.567 --> 21:33.567
would be an ally to me.

21:33.567 --> 21:35.900
And ask.

21:35.900 --> 21:37.567
Don't assume you know.

21:37.567 --> 21:39.233
Don't assume that everybody's

21:39.233 --> 21:41.567
big issue is gender-free

21:41.567 --> 21:43.233
bathrooms.

21:43.233 --> 21:45.567
Uh, it's not.

21:45.567 --> 21:47.233
And for some people it is the

21:47.233 --> 21:49.567
most pressing issue.

21:49.567 --> 21:50.567
Ask.

21:50.567 --> 21:51.900
That's the first step of being a

21:51.900 --> 21:53.233
good ally.

21:53.233 --> 21:55.567
Oh, one word of warning, okay?

21:55.567 --> 21:57.567
>> CAITLYN: Okay. Go.

21:57.567 --> 21:58.900
>> KATE: You're entering an

21:58.900 --> 22:00.300
adolescence.

22:00.300 --> 22:02.967
You're going to go through

22:02.967 --> 22:04.300
everything you went through in

22:04.300 --> 22:05.967
adolescence before.

22:05.967 --> 22:07.633
It's gonna happen again.

22:07.633 --> 22:09.300
This happens whenever someone

22:09.300 --> 22:11.300
takes on a new identity.

22:11.300 --> 22:12.633
It's all about, "Oh, my God,

22:12.633 --> 22:13.967
they're looking at me.

22:13.967 --> 22:14.967
Oh, I am...

22:14.967 --> 22:16.633
Oh, no, they're looking at me.

22:16.633 --> 22:18.300
What am I gonna do?"

22:18.300 --> 22:22.633
And we learn to get through

22:22.633 --> 22:24.300
adolescence.

22:24.300 --> 22:25.300
>> CAITLYN: What type of

22:25.300 --> 22:27.633
suggestions would you give me as

22:27.633 --> 22:30.300
I move forward?

22:30.300 --> 22:31.633
>> KATE: When the rug gets

22:31.633 --> 22:32.967
pulled out from under you...

22:32.967 --> 22:34.300
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

22:34.300 --> 22:35.633
>> KATE: ...jump.

22:35.633 --> 22:37.633
(Jen laughs)

22:37.633 --> 22:38.633
>> CAITLYN: I thank you

22:38.633 --> 22:39.633
for your advice.

22:39.633 --> 22:40.633
It's really an honor to meet

22:40.633 --> 22:41.633
you.

22:41.633 --> 22:42.967
I appreciate all you've done.

22:42.967 --> 22:45.300
>> KATE: I appreciate how you're

22:45.300 --> 22:46.967
using your position and

22:46.967 --> 22:48.633
privilege to do good.

22:48.633 --> 22:49.967
>> CAITLYN: Well, keep it going,

22:49.967 --> 22:50.967
all right?

22:50.967 --> 22:52.300
I did, uh, that one more wink.

22:52.300 --> 22:53.300
Look out.

22:53.300 --> 22:54.967
(laughter and clapping)

22:54.967 --> 22:56.300
>> KATE: Didn't escape me, baby

22:56.300 --> 22:57.300
girl.

22:57.300 --> 22:58.300
>> CAITLYN: Really? Okay.

22:58.300 --> 23:00.067
Okay, good, really.

23:00.067 --> 23:01.700
I've found so many people that

23:01.700 --> 23:03.700
love and accept you and... of

23:03.700 --> 23:05.067
who you really are.

23:05.067 --> 23:06.700
They want to change society's

23:06.700 --> 23:09.700
perception of gender identity.

23:09.700 --> 23:11.067
And to be honest with you,

23:11.067 --> 23:12.700
they're so normal, I can't stand

23:12.700 --> 23:14.367
it.

23:14.367 --> 23:16.367
>> CANDIS: Are you good, honey?

23:16.367 --> 23:17.367
>> CAITLYN: No.

23:17.367 --> 23:19.067
>> CANDIS: No? You're not good?

23:19.067 --> 23:20.367
>> CAITLYN: Uh, I'm close.

23:20.367 --> 23:23.067
One second.

23:23.067 --> 23:24.067
>> CANDIS: (gasps) That's so

23:24.067 --> 23:24.700
cute.

23:24.700 --> 23:25.700
>> CAITLYN: Is that cute?

23:25.700 --> 23:26.700
>> CANDIS: No, that's super

23:26.700 --> 23:27.367
cute.

23:27.367 --> 23:28.367
>> CAITLYN: We had these for,

23:28.367 --> 23:29.367
uh, we had...

23:29.367 --> 23:30.367
>> CANDIS: I like the silk.

23:30.367 --> 23:31.367
>> CAITLYN: I know, they're

23:31.367 --> 23:32.067
so...

23:32.067 --> 23:33.067
>> CANDIS: I don't have...

23:33.067 --> 23:34.067
I don't have pajamas.

23:34.067 --> 23:35.067
>> CAITLYN: You don't have

23:35.067 --> 23:35.700
pajamas?

23:35.700 --> 23:36.700
>> CANDIS: No.

23:36.700 --> 23:37.700
>> CAITLYN: What do you sleep

23:37.700 --> 23:38.700
in?

23:38.700 --> 23:40.667
>> CANDIS: Nothing. (laughs)

23:44.767 --> 23:46.100
>> CAITLYN: To be very honest

23:46.100 --> 23:47.100
with you, if she would have been

23:47.100 --> 23:48.100
okay with me...

23:48.100 --> 23:49.100
>> KHLOE: Okay with you

23:49.100 --> 23:49.867
transitioning and still being

23:49.867 --> 23:50.533
married to her?

23:50.533 --> 23:51.300
>> CAITLYN: Not so much even

23:51.300 --> 23:52.067
transitioning, just living with

23:52.067 --> 23:53.100
it-- she would just have to be

23:53.100 --> 23:54.100
okay.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.100
>> KHLOE: Mm-hmm.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.100
>> CAITLYN: Instead, I

23:56.100 --> 23:57.433
constantly had to hide myself.

23:57.433 --> 23:59.100
I wasn't able to talk about it.

23:59.100 --> 24:00.500
Then once I got out to Malibu

24:00.500 --> 24:01.500
and we went our separate

24:01.500 --> 24:02.500
directions, I said: here I am,

24:02.500 --> 24:03.500
at my age, and I got the same

24:03.500 --> 24:04.500
problems I had when I was ten

24:04.500 --> 24:05.500
years old.

24:05.500 --> 24:06.500
>> KHLOE: Uh-huh.

24:06.500 --> 24:07.500
>> CAITLYN: What the hell am I

24:07.500 --> 24:09.467
gonna do with this?

24:18.933 --> 24:20.933
>> CANDIS: You're all changed

24:20.933 --> 24:22.267
and ready?

24:22.267 --> 24:23.600
>> CAITLYN: A beautiful day.

24:23.600 --> 24:25.567
>> CANDIS: It's a beautiful day.

24:29.267 --> 24:31.267
>> CAITLYN: Perfect. Perfect.

24:31.267 --> 24:32.267
(Candis laughs)

24:32.267 --> 24:33.267
I'll be able to sneak out and

24:33.267 --> 24:34.267
sneak in.

24:34.267 --> 24:34.933
>> CANDIS: Yes.

24:34.933 --> 24:35.933
>> CAITLYN: Thank you.

24:35.933 --> 24:36.600
That was fun.

24:36.600 --> 24:37.600
>> CANDIS: Yeah, that was so

24:37.600 --> 24:38.267
much fun.

24:38.267 --> 24:39.267
>> CAITLYN: I know...

24:39.267 --> 24:40.267
>> CANDIS: I'm glad that you get

24:40.267 --> 24:40.933
to...

24:40.933 --> 24:41.933
>> CAITLYN: I know.

24:41.933 --> 24:42.933
>> CANDIS: ...sneak away for a

24:42.933 --> 24:43.600
minute.

24:43.600 --> 24:44.500
>> CAITLYN: All right, babe.

24:44.500 --> 24:45.167
>> CANDIS: All right, honey.

24:45.167 --> 24:45.833
I'll see you later.

24:45.833 --> 24:46.600
>> CAITLYN: Till the next time.

24:46.600 --> 24:47.600
>> CANDIS: Till the next time.

24:47.600 --> 24:48.600
>> CAITLYN: Look at that hot

24:48.600 --> 24:49.600
shot.

24:49.600 --> 24:50.600
That's the final reminder.

24:50.600 --> 24:51.600
(Candis laughs)

24:51.600 --> 24:52.600
Okay. Thank you!

24:52.600 --> 24:55.267
>> CANDIS: Thanks.

24:55.267 --> 24:56.600
>> CAITLYN: Candis and I have

24:56.600 --> 24:57.600
been spending a lot of time

24:57.600 --> 24:58.600
together.

24:58.600 --> 24:59.600
I really like Candis.

24:59.600 --> 25:00.667
I admit, she's nice.

25:00.667 --> 25:01.667
She's a beautiful lady.

25:01.667 --> 25:04.333
We have a lot of fun.

25:04.333 --> 25:05.667
I'm just learning so much from

25:05.667 --> 25:07.067
her, and she's really a lot of

25:07.067 --> 25:08.967
fun to be around.

25:15.700 --> 25:17.067
>> SUSAN: Caitlyn!

25:17.067 --> 25:18.067
>> CAITLYN: How are you?

25:18.067 --> 25:18.900
>> SUSAN: How are you, honey?

25:18.900 --> 25:19.700
>> CAITLYN: Oh, I'm doing fine.

25:19.700 --> 25:20.700
How about you?

25:20.700 --> 25:22.500
>> SUSAN: Good, good, good.

25:22.500 --> 25:23.567
>> CAITLYN: Susan Landon-- she

25:23.567 --> 25:24.767
works for the L.A. Transgender

25:24.767 --> 25:26.333
Center, primarily with families,

25:26.333 --> 25:28.867
and she has been extremely

25:28.867 --> 25:30.500
supportive during this

25:30.500 --> 25:31.867
transition.

25:31.867 --> 25:33.367
Let's start with family.

25:33.367 --> 25:34.700
>> SUSAN: Okay.

25:34.700 --> 25:35.700
>> CAITLYN: Where we're at with

25:35.700 --> 25:36.700
the family.

25:36.700 --> 25:37.700
>> SUSAN: Yes.

25:37.700 --> 25:38.700
What's your relationship with

25:38.700 --> 25:39.700
them right now?

25:39.700 --> 25:41.067
Are you... are you kind of...?

25:41.067 --> 25:42.067
>> CAITLYN: I really haven't

25:42.067 --> 25:43.067
talked much to them. Yeah.

25:43.067 --> 25:44.067
>> SUSAN: Okay.

25:44.067 --> 25:45.667
>> CAITLYN: It's extraordinarily

25:45.667 --> 25:48.100
difficult with the girls.

25:48.100 --> 25:49.367
And I've said right from the

25:49.367 --> 25:51.700
beginning: I don't want to hurt

25:51.700 --> 25:53.067
my kids.

25:53.067 --> 25:54.067
>> SUSAN: I know.

25:54.067 --> 25:55.700
>> CAITLYN: And then having a

25:55.700 --> 25:57.367
difficult time with pretty much

25:57.367 --> 25:59.700
everything I do hurts... down in

25:59.700 --> 26:00.767
your soul.

26:00.767 --> 26:01.767
>> SUSAN: Yeah.

26:01.767 --> 26:03.767
>> CAITLYN: Um, I text Khloe all

26:03.767 --> 26:05.100
the time.

26:05.100 --> 26:07.767
And, um, you know, I don't get

26:07.767 --> 26:09.100
a, like, a big response from

26:09.100 --> 26:10.100
her.

26:10.100 --> 26:11.100
>> SUSAN: Right, right.

26:11.100 --> 26:12.100
>> CAITLYN: Which is a shame.

26:12.100 --> 26:13.100
Most of her issues are not the

26:13.100 --> 26:15.100
whole transition stuff.

26:15.100 --> 26:16.100
>> SUSAN: Mm-hmm.

26:16.100 --> 26:18.200
>> CAITLYN: It's more... she

26:18.200 --> 26:19.533
didn't like the Vanity Fair

26:19.533 --> 26:20.700
article, 'cause she thought I

26:20.700 --> 26:22.433
was putting her mom down.

26:22.433 --> 26:23.433
>> SUSAN: Uh-huh.

26:23.433 --> 26:24.433
>> CAITLYN: All this kind of

26:24.433 --> 26:25.433
stuff.

26:25.433 --> 26:26.433
>> SUSAN: Well, you know, it's

26:26.433 --> 26:28.433
all really new, and there have

26:28.433 --> 26:29.767
been lots of dynamics.

26:29.767 --> 26:30.767
>> CAITLYN: Mm-hmm.

26:30.767 --> 26:31.767
>> SUSAN: All right?

26:31.767 --> 26:32.767
In the family, over time, as in

26:32.767 --> 26:34.300
every family.

26:34.300 --> 26:35.333
>> CAITLYN: Right, I'm trying to

26:35.333 --> 26:36.467
do this right.

26:36.467 --> 26:37.833
They don't-- haven't-haven't had

26:37.833 --> 26:39.333
a chance to see that other side,

26:39.333 --> 26:40.367
you know?

26:40.367 --> 26:41.467
>> SUSAN: Right, right, exactly.

26:41.467 --> 26:42.467
>> CAITLYN: And that to me is

26:42.467 --> 26:43.467
frustrating, 'cause I feel

26:43.467 --> 26:44.567
better this way than I did in

26:44.567 --> 26:45.567
the old days.

26:45.567 --> 26:46.767
>> SUSAN: Of course you do!

26:46.767 --> 26:48.167
And you're more present.

26:48.167 --> 26:49.667
And you feel more available for

26:49.667 --> 26:51.067
the world and for everybody.

26:51.067 --> 26:52.333
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

26:52.333 --> 26:54.200
>> SUSAN: However, it may take

26:54.200 --> 26:57.533
some of them more time than,

26:57.533 --> 26:59.533
than feels comfortable for you.

26:59.533 --> 27:01.667
Caitlyn has a big family.

27:01.667 --> 27:04.100
So there are gonna be lots of

27:04.100 --> 27:05.333
dynamics to deal with and to

27:05.333 --> 27:06.567
talk through and to take time

27:06.567 --> 27:08.067
with.

27:08.067 --> 27:10.767
You can't force acceptance.

27:10.767 --> 27:12.600
It just, unfortunately, it

27:12.600 --> 27:14.433
doesn't work that way, and I

27:14.433 --> 27:17.767
think, uh, a lot of this is

27:17.767 --> 27:19.733
extremely painful for her.

27:23.367 --> 27:24.567
>> CAITLYN: Hello.

27:24.567 --> 27:25.567
>> LORENZO: Hi.

27:25.567 --> 27:26.567
Lorenzo Benet.

27:26.567 --> 27:27.567
>> CAITLYN: Lorenzo, nice to see

27:27.567 --> 27:28.567
you.

27:28.567 --> 27:29.567
>> LORENZO: We've met before.

27:29.567 --> 27:30.567
>> CAITLYN: Yes, how are you?

27:30.567 --> 27:31.567
>> BOB: I'm Bob Weiner with the

27:31.567 --> 27:32.567
hospital.

27:32.567 --> 27:33.567
>> CAITLYN: Today Candis and I

27:33.567 --> 27:35.067
are going over to visit a group,

27:35.067 --> 27:36.900
Transforming Family.

27:36.900 --> 27:38.500
This is a support group for

27:38.500 --> 27:40.467
families whose children are

27:40.467 --> 27:41.967
dealing with gender identity

27:41.967 --> 27:43.133
issues.

27:43.133 --> 27:44.933
I'm just so excited, you know,

27:44.933 --> 27:46.233
to have the opportunity to talk

27:46.233 --> 27:47.967
to these kids and see how this

27:47.967 --> 27:51.567
program gives these kids time

27:51.567 --> 27:54.233
and a good environment to be

27:54.233 --> 27:56.300
able to mend their relationships

27:56.300 --> 27:58.167
with their family.

27:58.167 --> 28:00.233
Sometimes it's good to really

28:00.233 --> 28:01.800
go see how other families have

28:01.800 --> 28:03.667
dealt with issues like this.

28:03.667 --> 28:05.567
Hopefully I'll be able to learn

28:05.567 --> 28:07.167
something today, so it can help

28:07.167 --> 28:09.067
me with dealing with my kids.

28:09.067 --> 28:10.200
Well, hi there.

28:10.200 --> 28:11.567
>> CHAZ: Hello.

28:11.567 --> 28:12.633
>> CAITLYN: Good to see you.

28:12.633 --> 28:13.767
>> CHAZ: Good to see you, too.

28:13.767 --> 28:14.967
>> CAITLYN: How you doing, Chaz?

28:14.967 --> 28:16.367
In your transition...

28:16.367 --> 28:17.367
>> CHAZ: Yes.

28:17.367 --> 28:18.367
>> CAITLYN: Okay? Which

28:18.367 --> 28:19.533
obviously I was watching and

28:19.533 --> 28:20.767
everybody else was watching.

28:20.767 --> 28:22.067
>> CHAZ: Mm-hmm.

28:22.067 --> 28:23.200
>> CAITLYN: I know it's been a

28:23.200 --> 28:24.367
lot of hard work, but you've

28:24.367 --> 28:25.367
done a very good job.

28:25.367 --> 28:26.367
>> CHAZ: Thank you.

28:26.367 --> 28:27.367
>> CAITLYN: And I was really

28:27.367 --> 28:28.367
glad to see that.

28:28.367 --> 28:29.367
For the longest time, I've

28:29.367 --> 28:30.700
wanted to talk to Chaz.

28:30.700 --> 28:31.867
Uh, I met him at Dancing with

28:31.867 --> 28:33.267
the Stars briefly and obviously

28:33.267 --> 28:34.867
I couldn't tell him my story.

28:34.867 --> 28:36.733
You know, he came out publicly

28:36.733 --> 28:38.367
before I did, so finally having

28:38.367 --> 28:40.167
the opportunity to spend some

28:40.167 --> 28:42.067
time with him, uh, I think it's

28:42.067 --> 28:43.100
gonna be great.

28:43.100 --> 28:44.733
I can learn a lot from him.

28:44.733 --> 28:46.900
Hello.

28:46.900 --> 28:48.533
>> NICK: Come on in.

28:48.533 --> 28:50.067
>> CAITLYN: Well, hi, everybody.

28:50.067 --> 28:51.400
How are you doing?

28:51.400 --> 28:53.200
>> OTHERS: Good.

28:53.200 --> 28:54.600
>> CAITLYN: I'm Caitlyn.

28:54.600 --> 28:55.600
This is Candis if you didn't

28:55.600 --> 28:56.600
know.

28:56.600 --> 28:57.600
>> CANDIS: Hi, everybody.

28:57.600 --> 28:58.900
>> CAITLYN: My good friend.

28:58.900 --> 29:00.200
>> NICK: Hello. My name is Nick,

29:00.200 --> 29:01.467
and I work at GLAAD.

29:01.467 --> 29:02.633
And this is a group for both the

29:02.633 --> 29:03.633
kids and the parents and the

29:03.633 --> 29:04.833
siblings and the grandparents to

29:04.833 --> 29:06.467
come and get support.

29:06.467 --> 29:07.833
>> CHAZ: Nick and I both started

29:07.833 --> 29:10.633
facilitating here in 2009, so...

29:10.633 --> 29:12.233
>> CAITLYN: Oh, wow, okay.

29:12.233 --> 29:13.767
>> CHAZ: And to see the

29:13.767 --> 29:15.367
transition that happens, the

29:15.367 --> 29:16.733
magic that happens, 'cause we

29:16.733 --> 29:18.233
don't know what goes on in

29:18.233 --> 29:19.767
there, but there is a magic that

29:19.767 --> 29:21.300
happens in there with the

29:21.300 --> 29:22.800
parents, and we just get to see

29:22.800 --> 29:24.167
the effect that it has on the

29:24.167 --> 29:25.933
kids in here.

29:25.933 --> 29:28.833
And I've had the privilege of

29:28.833 --> 29:30.867
seeing kids come in in a kind of

29:30.867 --> 29:33.600
difficult place sometimes,

29:33.600 --> 29:35.500
because their parents are just

29:35.500 --> 29:36.967
not understanding and not

29:36.967 --> 29:38.867
accepting, and we get to see,

29:38.867 --> 29:40.667
through the kids, the

29:40.667 --> 29:42.267
transformation that happens with

29:42.267 --> 29:43.567
the parents, and suddenly the

29:43.567 --> 29:45.067
kids are, you know, doing so

29:45.067 --> 29:46.333
much better.

29:46.333 --> 29:47.767
The families are doing better.

29:47.767 --> 29:49.133
They're happy, they're healthy.

29:49.133 --> 29:50.767
A different kid, you know,

29:50.767 --> 29:52.500
emerges.

29:52.500 --> 29:53.800
>> AUBREY: Having that, like,

29:53.800 --> 29:55.967
base, um, has just let me do so

29:55.967 --> 29:57.133
much more; without my parents

29:57.133 --> 29:58.900
supporting me, I would never be

29:58.900 --> 30:00.233
in, you know, college.

30:00.233 --> 30:01.233
I would never be getting a

30:01.233 --> 30:02.233
degree.

30:02.233 --> 30:03.733
I, you know, wouldn't be able to

30:03.733 --> 30:04.900
have a connection with my

30:04.900 --> 30:06.500
siblings or my cousins and

30:06.500 --> 30:07.667
actually be active, you know,

30:07.667 --> 30:09.133
and be kind of political,

30:09.133 --> 30:10.800
almost.

30:10.800 --> 30:12.067
>> ZOEY: I started my transition

30:12.067 --> 30:13.467
when I was nine years old, and

30:13.467 --> 30:15.400
so I feel like the fact that I

30:15.400 --> 30:16.833
have support from my mom and my

30:16.833 --> 30:18.133
sister and my brother, I feel

30:18.133 --> 30:19.533
like it's made me so much more

30:19.533 --> 30:21.100
confident and it's helped me get

30:21.100 --> 30:22.400
better grades in school.

30:22.400 --> 30:23.467
It's helped me stay in school

30:23.467 --> 30:24.600
still.

30:24.600 --> 30:25.933
And I feel like, without my

30:25.933 --> 30:27.200
mom's support, I wouldn't be

30:27.200 --> 30:28.367
here today.

30:28.367 --> 30:29.367
Also I feel like I'm very

30:29.367 --> 30:30.367
honored and happy to have her

30:30.367 --> 30:31.800
in my life, so yeah.

30:31.800 --> 30:33.033
>> CAITLYN: Whose parents really

30:33.033 --> 30:34.100
had a difficult struggle with

30:34.100 --> 30:35.100
it?

30:35.100 --> 30:36.400
Right there.

30:36.400 --> 30:37.900
>> SCOTT: Yeah, my mom and dad

30:37.900 --> 30:39.000
didn't believe it at first.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.933
They were like, "That's crazy."

30:40.933 --> 30:42.567
And we had this jar, and it was,

30:42.567 --> 30:44.400
if you called me the wrong

30:44.400 --> 30:46.033
pronoun, you gave me a dollar.

30:46.033 --> 30:47.100
(laughter)

30:47.100 --> 30:48.100
>> CAITLYN: How did that work

30:48.100 --> 30:49.100
out?

30:49.100 --> 30:50.100
>> SCOTT: I made a hundred

30:50.100 --> 30:51.100
dollars.

30:51.100 --> 30:52.633
>> CAITLYN: Hey! That's, uh,

30:52.633 --> 30:53.967
pretty good.

30:53.967 --> 30:55.367
>> NICK: So, now we're going to

30:55.367 --> 30:56.733
allow our guests to go talk to

30:56.733 --> 30:57.933
the parents.

30:57.933 --> 30:58.933
>> CAITLYN: Let's go talk to the

30:58.933 --> 31:00.067
parents.

31:00.067 --> 31:01.067
>> CANDIS: Mm-hmm.

31:01.067 --> 31:02.067
>> CAITLYN: Thank you all for

31:02.067 --> 31:03.067
sharing your stories.

31:03.067 --> 31:04.067
>> CANDIS: It warms my heart, it

31:04.067 --> 31:05.533
inspires me to see what a great

31:05.533 --> 31:07.467
start you guys have.

31:07.467 --> 31:08.467
It's incredible.

31:08.467 --> 31:09.467
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

31:09.467 --> 31:10.467
>> NICK: All right, well,

31:10.467 --> 31:11.467
thank you so much for having us.

31:11.467 --> 31:12.467
>> CAITLYN: Thank you for coming

31:12.467 --> 31:13.467
in.

31:13.467 --> 31:14.467
>> NICK: Thank you.

31:14.467 --> 31:17.433
>> CAITLYN: There are so many

31:17.433 --> 31:20.200
good people out there that

31:20.200 --> 31:22.733
really are dedicated to

31:22.733 --> 31:24.833
dealing with this issue in the

31:24.833 --> 31:26.667
transgender community.

31:26.667 --> 31:28.933
I know how these kids can feel.

31:28.933 --> 31:30.567
I've been there.

31:30.567 --> 31:31.800
And the love and acceptance of

31:31.800 --> 31:33.400
your family is extraordinarily

31:33.400 --> 31:35.167
important.

31:35.167 --> 31:37.067
Uh, I want to thank all of you

31:37.067 --> 31:38.633
for coming in, because the

31:38.633 --> 31:40.267
parenting thing is tough.

31:40.267 --> 31:41.667
I mean, there is a very dark

31:41.667 --> 31:43.067
side to this.

31:43.067 --> 31:44.733
I've heard such horror stories

31:44.733 --> 31:46.633
of families kicking their kids

31:46.633 --> 31:48.100
out of the house, and so,

31:48.100 --> 31:49.900
protecting your children from

31:49.900 --> 31:51.833
all of that, um, being a good

31:51.833 --> 31:53.767
loving parent, um, and

31:53.767 --> 31:55.867
supportive is extraordinarily

31:55.867 --> 31:57.633
important.

31:57.633 --> 31:59.300
>> CANDIS: I'm as well-adjusted

31:59.300 --> 32:01.333
as I am because my parents, from

32:01.333 --> 32:02.833
the very beginning, were

32:02.833 --> 32:04.800
completely supportive.

32:04.800 --> 32:06.567
So I applaud you guys for being

32:06.567 --> 32:08.600
here and being so supportive.

32:08.600 --> 32:10.333
>> JULIA: Yeah, I mean, I came

32:10.333 --> 32:12.067
here as a, you know, uh,

32:12.067 --> 32:14.667
completely lost almost two years

32:14.667 --> 32:17.767
ago, panic-driven, I guess, and

32:17.767 --> 32:20.500
not even two years later, seeing

32:20.500 --> 32:22.633
Elliot become Elliot has changed

32:22.633 --> 32:24.667
how I perceive myself, how I

32:24.667 --> 32:26.633
perceive the world and what I

32:26.633 --> 32:28.833
think is important.

32:28.833 --> 32:30.233
>> CYNDIE: As parents, I think

32:30.233 --> 32:32.700
we, we know our children and we

32:32.700 --> 32:34.300
know who they are.

32:34.300 --> 32:35.700
And people ask me a lot of "Oh,

32:35.700 --> 32:36.700
well, what if they change their

32:36.700 --> 32:37.700
mind?"

32:37.700 --> 32:38.700
>> CAITLYN: Hmm.

32:38.700 --> 32:39.700
>> CYNDIE: They're not going to

32:39.700 --> 32:40.700
change their mind.

32:40.700 --> 32:41.800
The kid has been this way since

32:41.800 --> 32:42.967
he was two, you know?

32:42.967 --> 32:43.967
They're not gonna change their

32:43.967 --> 32:44.967
mind.

32:44.967 --> 32:45.967
>> SCOTT: We had, we got those

32:45.967 --> 32:46.967
questions right away.

32:46.967 --> 32:47.967
It's like, "Are you sure?"

32:47.967 --> 32:49.367
I was like, "Look, I-I'm just

32:49.367 --> 32:50.633
following his lead." Right?

32:50.633 --> 32:51.833
We-we cut off the hair, he's a

32:51.833 --> 32:53.567
happier kid, right?

32:53.567 --> 32:54.833
We-we changed his name, he's a

32:54.833 --> 32:55.933
happier kid.

32:55.933 --> 32:56.933
>> JED: If you have a

32:56.933 --> 32:58.067
transgender kid, you are living

32:58.067 --> 33:00.267
with a unicorn, an amazing human

33:00.267 --> 33:01.867
being, like, to be next to

33:01.867 --> 33:03.500
someone so brave, so cool, so

33:03.500 --> 33:05.133
close to themselves.

33:05.133 --> 33:06.600
And the reality is, Avery has

33:06.600 --> 33:08.833
been on point from age two

33:08.833 --> 33:09.833
apparently, you know what I

33:09.833 --> 33:10.833
mean?

33:10.833 --> 33:11.833
So the reality is, it's just,

33:11.833 --> 33:13.567
it's such an honor.

33:13.567 --> 33:14.867
>> OFELIA: It's so true what

33:14.867 --> 33:15.900
he's saying, because I didn't

33:15.900 --> 33:16.967
know I was as strong as I am

33:16.967 --> 33:18.333
until Zoey.

33:18.333 --> 33:19.833
People tell me, "Who's your role

33:19.833 --> 33:21.133
model? Who helps you?"

33:21.133 --> 33:23.400
She does, because I learned from

33:23.400 --> 33:26.500
her to move forward and do what

33:26.500 --> 33:28.233
she needs.

33:28.233 --> 33:30.500
>> CAITLYN: Transitioning is a

33:30.500 --> 33:31.533
difficult, difficult thing to

33:31.533 --> 33:32.800
do.

33:32.800 --> 33:34.367
Anybody goes through something

33:34.367 --> 33:35.667
like this, you realize that

33:35.667 --> 33:36.700
there's a lot of adjustments in

33:36.700 --> 33:38.200
the family.

33:38.200 --> 33:39.933
Right now, it's a little bit

33:39.933 --> 33:41.533
strained with Khloe.

33:41.533 --> 33:42.867
And I don't want that in my

33:42.867 --> 33:44.333
li... I want Khloe to continue

33:44.333 --> 33:46.100
to be very close to me.

33:46.100 --> 33:47.633
You know, I think we have, as

33:47.633 --> 33:49.567
parents, tremendous challenges

33:49.567 --> 33:51.567
in dealing with something like

33:51.567 --> 33:52.833
this.

33:52.833 --> 33:54.100
Thank you so much for coming in.

33:54.100 --> 33:55.600
I'm so glad I had an opportunity

33:55.600 --> 33:56.900
to meet all of you.

33:56.900 --> 33:58.867
I love what you're doing.

34:09.467 --> 34:10.800
Stevie!

34:10.800 --> 34:11.800
>> STEVIE: Good to see you

34:11.800 --> 34:12.800
again.

34:12.800 --> 34:14.400
>> CAITLYN: How you doing?

34:14.400 --> 34:15.633
Khloe and I have always been,

34:15.633 --> 34:17.400
um, very close.

34:17.400 --> 34:18.767
Khloe is also very opinionated.

34:18.767 --> 34:19.767
>> KHLOE: Thanks for calling me

34:19.767 --> 34:20.767
after I left your house.

34:20.767 --> 34:21.767
I haven't spoke to you since

34:21.767 --> 34:22.767
then when I left in tears.

34:22.767 --> 34:23.767
So you obviously...

34:23.767 --> 34:24.567
>> CAITLYN: You didn't call me,

34:24.567 --> 34:25.567
either.

34:25.567 --> 34:26.567
>> KHLOE: Why should I?

34:26.567 --> 34:27.333
You're the one who was (bleep)

34:27.333 --> 34:28.333
lying to me.

34:28.333 --> 34:29.067
>> CAITLYN: I'm not lying,

34:29.067 --> 34:29.967
Khloe.

34:29.967 --> 34:30.700
>> KHLOE: You were, until we got

34:30.700 --> 34:31.667
it out of you.

34:31.667 --> 34:32.367
>> CAITLYN: I just didn't

34:32.367 --> 34:33.367
tell you.

34:33.367 --> 34:34.367
She certainly has had her issues

34:34.367 --> 34:35.600
with me, especially the Vanity

34:35.600 --> 34:37.233
Fair article.

34:37.233 --> 34:38.300
And so today, I'm going over

34:38.300 --> 34:39.300
there.

34:39.300 --> 34:40.633
Gonna spend a little time with

34:40.633 --> 34:42.067
her and see if we can kind of

34:42.067 --> 34:44.167
hash things out.

34:44.167 --> 34:46.200
Oh, God.

35:09.100 --> 35:10.700
>> KHLOE: Oh, hey!

35:10.700 --> 35:12.433
>> CAITLYN: Hi, babe.

35:12.433 --> 35:13.433
>> KHLOE: How are you?

35:13.433 --> 35:14.433
>> CAITLYN: I'm wonderful.

35:14.433 --> 35:15.733
>> KHLOE: Let me see your purse.

35:15.733 --> 35:17.200
>> CAITLYN: Oh, don't get

35:17.200 --> 35:18.200
jealous.

35:18.200 --> 35:19.800
Donatella Ver... Versace sent

35:19.800 --> 35:20.800
it.

35:20.800 --> 35:22.433
>> KHLOE: Gorgeous.

35:22.433 --> 35:23.800
>> CAITLYN: It's a, uh, not on

35:23.800 --> 35:24.900
the market yet, but, so...

35:24.900 --> 35:25.867
>> KHLOE: It's not on

35:25.867 --> 35:26.400
the market?

35:26.400 --> 35:27.067
>> CAITLYN: Neither are

35:27.067 --> 35:27.567
the glasses.

35:27.567 --> 35:28.300
>> KHLOE: You don't say

35:28.300 --> 35:28.800
"the market."

35:28.800 --> 35:29.633
>> CAITLYN: Okay, not, not...

35:29.633 --> 35:30.667
>> KHLOE: Like, not in

35:30.667 --> 35:31.500
stores yet.

35:31.500 --> 35:32.500
>> CAITLYN: It's not in stores

35:32.500 --> 35:33.533
yet. Neither are the...

35:33.533 --> 35:34.467
>> KHLOE: Yeah, you don't say

35:34.467 --> 35:35.400
"on the market."

35:35.400 --> 35:36.233
>> CAITLYN: She also sent the...

35:36.233 --> 35:37.267
>> KHLOE: Those are cool.

35:37.267 --> 35:38.167
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

35:38.167 --> 35:39.200
>> KHLOE: I'm an aviator girl,

35:39.200 --> 35:40.200
but these are very...

35:40.200 --> 35:41.533
You know, I could see MJ wearing

35:41.533 --> 35:42.367
these.

35:42.367 --> 35:43.367
Like, they're very, like, chic,

35:43.367 --> 35:44.100
like Jackie O.

35:44.100 --> 35:45.100
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

35:45.100 --> 35:45.900
>> KHLOE: Who does

35:45.900 --> 35:46.600
your eyelashes?

35:46.600 --> 35:47.467
Do you know how to do that?

35:47.467 --> 35:48.467
>> CAITLYN: I can do it, but

35:48.467 --> 35:49.467
certainly somebody else does it

35:49.467 --> 35:50.567
better.

35:50.567 --> 35:51.333
>> KHLOE: I don't know

35:51.333 --> 35:52.100
how to do it.

35:52.100 --> 35:52.800
I don't wear fake lashes

35:52.800 --> 35:53.533
normally.

35:53.533 --> 35:54.133
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

35:54.133 --> 35:54.867
>> KHLOE: Have you ever heard of

35:54.867 --> 35:55.967
eyelash extensions?

35:55.967 --> 35:57.167
>> CAITLYN: Yes, I have heard of

35:57.167 --> 35:58.333
that, but I haven't done it.

35:58.333 --> 35:59.467
>> KHLOE: Yeah.

35:59.467 --> 36:00.733
We were saying that we should

36:00.733 --> 36:02.067
take you to a place to do it.

36:02.067 --> 36:03.200
Kendall and I were saying that.

36:03.200 --> 36:04.333
>> CAITLYN: I'm game.

36:04.333 --> 36:05.767
You got really good bottom

36:05.767 --> 36:06.833
lashes.

36:06.833 --> 36:07.833
>> KHLOE: I have really good

36:07.833 --> 36:08.833
lashes.

36:08.833 --> 36:09.600
>> CAITLYN: You have

36:09.600 --> 36:10.167
really good...

36:10.167 --> 36:11.467
Well, all the "K" girls do.

36:11.467 --> 36:12.467
>> KHLOE: That's the Armenian.

36:12.467 --> 36:13.233
>> CAITLYN: That's why I went

36:13.233 --> 36:14.267
with a "C."

36:14.267 --> 36:15.600
>> KHLOE: My God.

36:15.600 --> 36:18.067
(laughs)

36:18.067 --> 36:19.167
What were you doing today?

36:19.167 --> 36:20.233
>> CAITLYN: Khloe, you just

36:20.233 --> 36:21.467
can't even imagine the last

36:21.467 --> 36:23.200
couple of months, the stuff that

36:23.200 --> 36:25.733
I've learned.

36:25.733 --> 36:27.700
So much of it is so scary.

36:27.700 --> 36:30.067
I've met some incredible people.

36:30.067 --> 36:31.300
>> KHLOE: That's awesome.

36:31.300 --> 36:32.300
>> CAITLYN: Incredible

36:32.300 --> 36:34.367
organizations, all want to help.

36:34.367 --> 36:36.167
I spent some time with

36:36.167 --> 36:38.533
Chaz Bono and a whole group.

36:38.533 --> 36:42.133
But there's such big problems.

36:42.133 --> 36:43.800
The homelessness, people on the

36:43.800 --> 36:45.167
streets.

36:45.167 --> 36:46.167
>> KHLOE: Aw.

36:46.167 --> 36:47.167
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

36:47.167 --> 36:48.167
>> KHLOE: That's not good.

36:48.167 --> 36:50.367
>> CAITLYN: No, no, but, um,

36:50.367 --> 36:52.367
anyway, enough of that.

36:52.367 --> 36:54.733
We really haven't had a chance

36:54.733 --> 36:56.233
to sit down and talk after you

36:56.233 --> 36:58.833
sent me those really kind of...

36:58.833 --> 37:01.467
tough texts.

37:01.467 --> 37:02.500
>> KHLOE: Kim said that you said

37:02.500 --> 37:03.267
they were tough, and Kim read

37:03.267 --> 37:04.733
all of them, and then she was

37:04.733 --> 37:05.933
like, "These really weren't that

37:05.933 --> 37:07.100
tough."

37:07.100 --> 37:08.267
I just said, look, we don't care

37:08.267 --> 37:09.267
what you're doing, like,

37:09.267 --> 37:10.433
meaning, like, we don't care if

37:10.433 --> 37:11.167
you want to transition.

37:11.167 --> 37:12.167
We want to support you and be

37:12.167 --> 37:13.167
there for you.

37:13.167 --> 37:14.167
>> CAITLYN: Right.

37:14.167 --> 37:15.267
>> KHLOE: But we don't think

37:15.267 --> 37:17.800
that that entails you speaking

37:17.800 --> 37:19.167
negatively about my mom.

37:19.167 --> 37:20.467
In our opinion, you don't need

37:20.467 --> 37:21.567
to even mention our mom.

37:21.567 --> 37:23.433
Let's focus on the actual cause

37:23.433 --> 37:25.467
here, and let's not drag my mom

37:25.467 --> 37:26.600
through the mud.

37:26.600 --> 37:27.733
I would think you would come

37:27.733 --> 37:29.300
from a place of more compassion,

37:29.300 --> 37:30.567
especially when you have two

37:30.567 --> 37:31.800
young daughters who are greatly

37:31.800 --> 37:32.900
affected by it.

37:32.900 --> 37:35.067
And that was really my premise

37:35.067 --> 37:36.533
for the text messages, and then

37:36.533 --> 37:37.733
when you try to tell me that I

37:37.733 --> 37:38.733
don't know what I'm talking

37:38.733 --> 37:39.733
about...

37:39.733 --> 37:40.733
>> CAITLYN: Because you don't

37:40.733 --> 37:42.067
know, you don't know.

37:42.067 --> 37:43.467
To be very honest with you, if

37:43.467 --> 37:44.467
she would've been okay with

37:44.467 --> 37:45.467
me...

37:45.467 --> 37:46.067
>> KHLOE: Okay with you

37:46.067 --> 37:47.067
transitioning and still being

37:47.067 --> 37:47.767
married to her?

37:47.767 --> 37:48.533
>> CAITLYN: Not so much even

37:48.533 --> 37:49.267
transitioning, just living with

37:49.267 --> 37:50.133
it-- she would just have to be

37:50.133 --> 37:51.133
okay.

37:51.133 --> 37:53.133
Instead, I constantly had to

37:53.133 --> 37:54.500
hide myself.

37:54.500 --> 37:55.867
I wasn't able to talk about it.

37:55.867 --> 37:57.833
Then, once I got out to Malibu

37:57.833 --> 37:58.967
and we went our separate

37:58.967 --> 38:00.167
directions, I said, "Here I am

38:00.167 --> 38:01.700
at my age, and I got the same

38:01.700 --> 38:02.933
problems I had when I was ten

38:02.933 --> 38:03.967
years old.

38:03.967 --> 38:05.367
What the hell am I gonna do

38:05.367 --> 38:06.467
with this?

38:06.467 --> 38:09.567
Am I gonna continue to hide?

38:09.567 --> 38:11.533
I'm sick of that."

38:15.067 --> 38:16.200
>> CAITLYN: Once I got out to

38:16.200 --> 38:17.067
Malibu and we went our

38:17.067 --> 38:18.067
separate directions, I said,

38:18.067 --> 38:19.533
"Here I am at my age, and I got

38:19.533 --> 38:20.967
the same problems I had when I

38:20.967 --> 38:22.067
was ten years old.

38:22.067 --> 38:23.467
What the hell am I gonna do

38:23.467 --> 38:24.633
with this?

38:24.633 --> 38:28.067
Am I gonna continue to hide?

38:28.067 --> 38:30.967
I'm sick of that."

38:30.967 --> 38:32.600
I didn't think it was, like, a

38:32.600 --> 38:35.267
hatchet job on your mother.

38:35.267 --> 38:37.200
I have no... no issues with her.

38:37.200 --> 38:38.267
>> KHLOE: Yeah.

38:38.267 --> 38:40.100
Caitlyn kind of...

38:40.100 --> 38:42.067
She's allowed to have her own

38:42.067 --> 38:43.200
feelings, but she's very

38:43.200 --> 38:44.367
one-sided, and I don't think

38:44.367 --> 38:45.500
that's fair.

38:45.500 --> 38:46.800
There's so much I could say, but

38:46.800 --> 38:47.933
it's a losing battle and I'm

38:47.933 --> 38:48.967
just over it.

38:48.967 --> 38:50.567
At the end of the day, some

38:50.567 --> 38:51.767
things Cait will never

38:51.767 --> 38:53.467
understand, and I really just

38:53.467 --> 38:54.767
don't want to fight anymore.

38:54.767 --> 38:56.100
>> CAITLYN: You know, we took

38:56.100 --> 38:58.167
our break,

38:58.167 --> 39:00.800
and she was happier, I think,

39:00.800 --> 39:02.167
and I was happier.

39:02.167 --> 39:03.767
>> KHLOE: Yeah, I think you guys

39:03.767 --> 39:04.833
are both way happier.

39:04.833 --> 39:06.067
This is what should've happened.

39:06.067 --> 39:07.200
>> CAITLYN: Honestly, I wish she

39:07.200 --> 39:08.200
would call, you know?

39:08.200 --> 39:09.300
>> KHLOE: Well, tell her that.

39:09.300 --> 39:10.333
'Cause I think...

39:10.333 --> 39:11.333
>> CAITLYN: I have no problem.

39:11.333 --> 39:12.333
I'd have her out to the house.

39:12.333 --> 39:13.333
>> KHLOE: I think it's very

39:13.333 --> 39:14.400
weird... I could not imagine

39:14.400 --> 39:15.533
having a child with someone and

39:15.533 --> 39:16.967
not having some sort of

39:16.967 --> 39:18.233
relationship with them.

39:18.233 --> 39:19.900
I wish my mom and Caitlyn would

39:19.900 --> 39:21.900
conversate a little bit, even

39:21.900 --> 39:23.067
for the sake of Kendall and

39:23.067 --> 39:24.067
Kylie.

39:24.067 --> 39:25.067
I would understand if she

39:25.067 --> 39:26.200
doesn't want to see her, 'cause

39:26.200 --> 39:27.267
that might be uncomfortable for

39:27.267 --> 39:28.367
my mom, but I do think they

39:28.367 --> 39:29.367
should be able to pick up the

39:29.367 --> 39:30.367
phone.

39:30.367 --> 39:32.067
If something bad happens, my mom

39:32.067 --> 39:33.067
should check on her and vice

39:33.067 --> 39:34.067
versa.

39:34.067 --> 39:35.067
So I definitely want to say

39:35.067 --> 39:36.067
something to my mom.

39:36.067 --> 39:37.067
>> CAITLYN: I don't have any

39:37.067 --> 39:38.067
issues with her.

39:38.067 --> 39:39.067
I had 23 great years.

39:39.067 --> 39:40.067
>> KHLOE: Well, good.

39:40.067 --> 39:41.067
>> CAITLYN: Okay.

39:41.067 --> 39:42.067
Next question.

39:42.067 --> 39:45.067
When I said that the kids were a

39:45.067 --> 39:47.400
distraction, you're taking it in

39:47.400 --> 39:49.767
the wrong context.

39:49.767 --> 39:51.933
Uh, a distraction from who I am,

39:51.933 --> 39:53.067
yes.

39:53.067 --> 39:54.333
It doesn't mean they were just,

39:54.333 --> 39:55.500
I used them as a distraction.

39:55.500 --> 39:57.167
It was a distraction from

39:57.167 --> 39:58.367
my soul.

39:58.367 --> 39:59.733
>> KHLOE: I understand that.

39:59.733 --> 40:00.833
They were more offended by that.

40:00.833 --> 40:03.100
Kendall was.

40:03.100 --> 40:04.567
Kendall will never be

40:04.567 --> 40:05.667
confrontational with you.

40:05.667 --> 40:07.533
That's like-- she does not want

40:07.533 --> 40:08.700
that at all.

40:08.700 --> 40:09.900
So instead she'll vent to me or

40:09.900 --> 40:11.233
do this, and then I feel like I

40:11.233 --> 40:13.167
have to be the only person--

40:13.167 --> 40:15.333
well, now Kim, thank God, is

40:15.333 --> 40:16.467
actually saying things because

40:16.467 --> 40:17.700
I don't like being the only

40:17.700 --> 40:19.433
person that's, like, saying how

40:19.433 --> 40:21.467
everybody else feels.

40:21.467 --> 40:22.667
It makes me seem like this crazy

40:22.667 --> 40:24.067
bitch, and I'm like, I'm only a

40:24.067 --> 40:25.100
bitch.

40:25.100 --> 40:26.100
I don't want to be the crazy and

40:26.100 --> 40:27.100
the bitch.

40:27.100 --> 40:28.400
I want to just be one.

40:28.400 --> 40:30.700
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, and I see

40:30.700 --> 40:32.200
that.

40:32.200 --> 40:34.800
Just know that there's no...

40:34.800 --> 40:36.367
maliciousness in my heart and

40:36.367 --> 40:37.833
in my soul.

40:37.833 --> 40:40.100
>> KHLOE: Yeah.

40:40.100 --> 40:41.233
There's a lot of

40:41.233 --> 40:42.433
miscommunication, I think,

40:42.433 --> 40:43.500
'cause our channels of

40:43.500 --> 40:44.600
communication have dwindled a

40:44.600 --> 40:45.600
lot.

40:45.600 --> 40:47.200
>> CAITLYN: So many people in

40:47.200 --> 40:48.500
this family. (chuckles)

40:48.500 --> 40:49.767
>> KHLOE: Yeah, but you could

40:49.767 --> 40:50.833
do... Have you ever done group

40:50.833 --> 40:51.933
texting?

40:51.933 --> 40:53.033
>> CAITLYN: Oh, God.

40:53.033 --> 40:54.233
Group texting?

40:54.233 --> 40:55.267
You think that's the way to go?

40:55.267 --> 40:56.267
>> KHLOE: I mean, if you have an

40:56.267 --> 40:57.267
important dinner, you could just

40:57.267 --> 40:58.467
send a text one time, and you

40:58.467 --> 41:00.067
say, "Hey, dinner."

41:00.067 --> 41:01.333
(Khloe beeps, whooshes)

41:01.333 --> 41:02.433
>> CAITLYN: How do I do that?

41:02.433 --> 41:04.133
>> KHLOE: Let me show you.

41:04.133 --> 41:06.600
So, messages.

41:06.600 --> 41:08.067
That little box right there.

41:08.067 --> 41:09.500
>> CAITLYN: Okay, hold on.

41:09.500 --> 41:10.733
>> KHLOE: That's where you text.

41:10.733 --> 41:11.933
Your phone's right here.

41:11.933 --> 41:13.200
>> CAITLYN: In my Donatella

41:13.200 --> 41:14.267
Versace.

41:14.267 --> 41:15.267
>> KHLOE: Go to that button.

41:15.267 --> 41:16.267
>> CAITLYN: Okay, button.

41:16.267 --> 41:17.267
Wait a second, now what-- who

41:17.267 --> 41:18.267
did...?

41:18.267 --> 41:19.300
>> KHLOE: We have group texts

41:19.300 --> 41:20.300
going on all the time.

41:20.300 --> 41:21.300
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, I know.

41:21.300 --> 41:22.300
All right, I love you.

41:22.300 --> 41:23.533
I want my relationship with

41:23.533 --> 41:24.833
Khloe to stay very close.

41:24.833 --> 41:26.433
I want her to know that she can

41:26.433 --> 41:27.533
call me any time.

41:27.533 --> 41:28.967
I want to know that it's okay if

41:28.967 --> 41:29.967
I call her.

41:29.967 --> 41:31.700
I realize that when you make a

41:31.700 --> 41:33.200
drastic change in life...

41:33.200 --> 41:34.333
>> KHLOE: Love you.

41:34.333 --> 41:35.333
>> CAITLYN: ...everything takes

41:35.333 --> 41:36.333
time.

41:36.333 --> 41:37.667
You're going to make mistakes,

41:37.667 --> 41:38.833
but if you can keep the

41:38.833 --> 41:40.267
communication open, you can

41:40.267 --> 41:41.700
pretty much get through

41:41.700 --> 41:42.700
anything.

41:42.700 --> 41:44.100
Did we clear anything up?

41:44.100 --> 41:45.100
>> KHLOE: Mm-hmm.

41:45.100 --> 41:46.100
We're good.

41:46.100 --> 41:47.300
>> CAITLYN: I am... (snapping)

41:47.300 --> 41:48.300
out of here.

41:48.300 --> 41:50.633
>> KHLOE: Bye.

42:00.933 --> 42:01.767
>> CANDIS: You should come to

42:01.767 --> 42:02.767
New York. I'm performing there

42:02.767 --> 42:03.767
for Gay Pride.

42:03.767 --> 42:04.767
>> CAITLYN: Okay, guys.

42:04.767 --> 42:06.200
This is it. To New York.

42:06.200 --> 42:07.533
>> CANDIS: To an amazing trip.

42:07.533 --> 42:09.733
(laughter)

42:09.733 --> 42:12.267
(cheering)

42:12.267 --> 42:13.567
>> WOMAN: Ladies and gentlemen,

42:13.567 --> 42:15.800
the courageous, the stunning

42:15.800 --> 42:18.067
Caitlyn Jenner.

42:18.067 --> 42:19.333
>> CAITLYN: Uh-oh!

42:19.333 --> 42:20.333
Who is in the house?

42:20.333 --> 42:21.833
This is Zeem.

42:21.833 --> 42:22.833
>> MATT: Good to meet you.

42:22.833 --> 42:23.800
>> ZEEM: Hi. I'm gonna tell my

42:23.800 --> 42:24.567
friends back home.

42:24.567 --> 42:25.433
They gonna be like, "Whatever.

42:25.433 --> 42:26.333
You lying."

42:26.333 --> 42:27.067
(laughter)

42:27.067 --> 42:27.833
>> REFEREE: May the best team

42:27.833 --> 42:29.133
win!

42:29.133 --> 42:30.367
>> CAITLYN: Don't let it go!

42:30.367 --> 42:31.833
>> CANDIS: You're changing your

42:31.833 --> 42:32.967
life, you're changing your name.

42:32.967 --> 42:34.067
Let's celebrate the new

42:34.067 --> 42:35.367
beginning.

42:35.367 --> 42:37.200
>> CAITLYN: Hey!

42:37.200 --> 42:38.200
>> WOMAN: Oh, my God,

42:38.200 --> 42:39.200
Boy George!

42:39.200 --> 42:40.200
(cheering)

42:40.200 --> 42:41.500
>> CAITLYN: For the first time,

42:41.500 --> 42:44.067
I feel like I fit in someplace,

42:44.067 --> 42:45.500
because of these ladies over

42:45.500 --> 42:45.867
here.

42:45.867 --> 42:47.800
(applause)

42:47.800 --> 42:49.600
>> KRIS: You're sensitive and

42:49.600 --> 42:51.567
amazing to all these new people

42:51.567 --> 42:52.900
in your life.

42:52.900 --> 42:54.267
You're just not so sensitive and

42:54.267 --> 42:55.767
amazing to the family that you

42:55.767 --> 42:57.067
left behind.

42:57.067 --> 42:58.067
>> CAITLYN: I try to do

42:58.067 --> 43:00.067
everything I can to be nice,

43:00.067 --> 43:01.333
reach out.

43:01.333 --> 43:03.267
You have to see it from my

43:03.267 --> 43:04.300
perspective.

43:04.300 --> 43:05.967
Be an ally when it comes to

43:05.967 --> 43:07.267
dealing with the kids.

43:07.267 --> 43:08.833
>> KRIS: When you feel like you

43:08.833 --> 43:10.200
gave your whole life to

43:10.200 --> 43:11.933
somebody, and the sum of it all

43:11.933 --> 43:14.300
was, "You were a distraction..."

43:14.300 --> 43:15.833
>> CAITLYN: Don't go there.

43:15.833 --> 43:17.533
This is not the issue.

43:17.533 --> 43:19.700
I was defending myself.

43:19.700 --> 43:21.833
It was a distraction from the

43:21.833 --> 43:23.067
sense of who I was.

43:23.067 --> 43:24.300
That doesn't mean I didn't love

43:24.300 --> 43:25.633
you or the kids.
