WEBVTT

00:00.067 --> 00:01.867
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Of all the indignities</i>
<i> of middle school,</i>

00:01.869 --> 00:05.037
<i> nothing was worse than the</i>
<i> soul-crushing humiliation</i>

00:05.039 --> 00:07.473
<i> of being forced to swim</i>
<i> in gym class.</i>

00:07.475 --> 00:09.975
All right, swimmers,
let's have some fun!

00:09.977 --> 00:14.013
<i> The sickening smell</i>
<i> of chlorine, the thick,</i>
<i> humid air,</i>

00:14.015 --> 00:15.414
<i> having to be shirtless</i>
<i> in front of your class</i>

00:15.416 --> 00:18.050
<i> while you were at your most</i>
<i> gawky and awkward.</i>

00:18.052 --> 00:19.351
<i> And it was worse</i>
<i> for the girls.</i>

00:19.353 --> 00:20.753
<i> They would have to parade</i>
<i> in front of us</i>

00:20.755 --> 00:22.354
<i> at the most</i>
<i> self-conscious time</i>
<i> in their lives.</i>

00:22.356 --> 00:24.823
Please don't look at me.
Please don't look at me.
Please don't look at me!

00:24.825 --> 00:30.262
<i> Yep, you dreaded it all year</i>
<i> until, at last,</i>
<i> it was unavoidable.</i>

00:30.264 --> 00:31.263
<i> Or was it?</i>

00:31.265 --> 00:35.401
Goldfarb.
No suit, again, I see.
What is it this time?

00:35.403 --> 00:36.902
I have a contagious butt rash.

00:36.904 --> 00:38.103
ADULT ADAM: <i> I hated</i>
<i> swimming so much,</i>

00:38.105 --> 00:40.572
<i> I would try pretty much</i>
<i> anything to get out of it.</i>

00:40.574 --> 00:42.474
Swimming is against
my religion.

00:42.476 --> 00:43.409
I'm allergic to water.

00:43.411 --> 00:44.410
I have an irritable bowel.

00:44.412 --> 00:46.645
I got one heck
of a fungus downstairs.

00:46.647 --> 00:48.814
<i> Yep, I had beaten the system.</i>

00:48.816 --> 00:50.349
Adam is failing
gym class.

00:50.351 --> 00:51.250
ADULT ADAM: <i> Or so I thought.</i>

00:51.252 --> 00:53.452
I'd say the failing is yours,
but continue.

00:53.454 --> 00:57.356
Your son comes in every day
with a new excuse
for why he can't swim.

00:57.358 --> 00:58.490
If my schmoop says
he can't swim,

00:58.492 --> 01:01.660
then he must have
a legitimate reason,
and I fully support him.

01:01.662 --> 01:05.097
So, you can vouch for your
son's claim that he can't
get into the pool

01:05.099 --> 01:08.700
because he's a CIA operative
wearing a wire?

01:08.702 --> 01:09.768
That's classified.

01:09.770 --> 01:13.338
I think I can shed some light
on what's going on here.

01:13.340 --> 01:14.373
Wow. Please do.

01:14.375 --> 01:18.310
Your boy is self-conscious
because of his wig.

01:18.312 --> 01:19.745
He doesn't wear a wig.

01:19.747 --> 01:21.046
Well, I'm stumped.

01:21.048 --> 01:22.247
But you better
figure something out,

01:22.249 --> 01:24.883
because an 'F' in gym
means Adam
will never get to be

01:24.885 --> 01:27.686
a physical educator
later in life.

01:28.589 --> 01:28.987
Oh, no.

01:28.989 --> 01:31.290
He'll also have to repeat
the 8th grade.

01:31.292 --> 01:31.890
Oh, no!

01:31.892 --> 01:34.193
Yeah, probably
should've led with that.

01:35.763 --> 01:36.829
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

01:36.831 --> 01:41.233
<i> ¶ But nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

01:43.370 --> 01:44.303
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

01:44.305 --> 01:48.340
<i> ¶ But the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

01:48.442 --> 01:50.676
ADULT ADAM: <i> It was</i>
<i> October 14, 1980-something,</i>

01:50.678 --> 01:53.378
<i> and Erica was doing</i>
<i> what she did every day,</i>

01:53.380 --> 01:54.746
<i> hanging with the cool kids.</i>

01:54.748 --> 01:56.882
This one's shiny,
and this one's thermal.

01:56.884 --> 01:57.850
This one's flannel.
(GASPS)

01:57.852 --> 02:00.385
This one's denim.
Ooh, that's super-rare.

02:00.387 --> 02:01.420
Oh, my God.

02:01.422 --> 02:05.991
We are smart,
ambitious women, and we're
talking about scrunchies.

02:05.993 --> 02:08.927
Is this really the best
that we can do in our lives?

02:08.929 --> 02:11.296
Ooh, wait.
I've got something.

02:11.298 --> 02:12.664
No. It's also about
scrunchies.

02:12.666 --> 02:16.401
ADULT ADAM: <i> But lately she had</i>
<i> been finding hanging</i>
<i> with the cool kids</i>

02:16.403 --> 02:17.469
<i> a little less fulfilling.</i>

02:17.471 --> 02:20.005
<i> Luckily, her search</i>
<i> for meaning came to an end</i>

02:20.007 --> 02:22.841
<i> when she saw</i>
<i> one iconic video.</i>

02:22.843 --> 02:24.910
We are the world,
<i> an epic song for charity</i>

02:24.912 --> 02:27.779
<i> that brought together</i>
<i> all America's</i>
<i> biggest music legends.</i>

02:27.781 --> 02:31.550
<i> And for Erica,</i>
<i> it was about to give her</i>
<i> shallow life meaning.</i>

02:31.552 --> 02:33.986
Look, Kenny Rogers
and Kenny Loggins!

02:33.988 --> 02:36.622
That's the two best Kennys
in one room. Unheard of.

02:36.624 --> 02:41.059
ERICA: You're right.
If they can make
a difference, so can I.

02:43.030 --> 02:46.265
This changes everything.

02:46.267 --> 02:47.065
Attention, everyone.

02:47.067 --> 02:51.770
After some careful reflection,
I am devoting myself
to changing the world.

02:51.772 --> 02:53.005
Good for you,
sweetheart.

02:53.007 --> 02:55.340
That's very selfless
and admirable.

02:55.342 --> 02:57.576
Yeah, that's great.
(COUGHING) Poser.

02:57.578 --> 02:58.076
Excuse me?

02:58.078 --> 03:00.312
Oh, I was just
agreeing with Pops.
(COUGHING) Poser.

03:00.314 --> 03:02.247
You take it back
right now.

03:02.249 --> 03:04.449
Poser!
I am not a poser.

03:04.451 --> 03:06.518
P-P-P-Poser,
poser, P-P-Poser.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.287
Stop it. Stop.
(VOCALIZING)

03:08.289 --> 03:09.388
(COUGHS) Poser.
Shut up!

03:09.390 --> 03:12.758
ADULT ADAM: <i> Back then,</i>
<i> "poser" was the worst name</i>
<i> you could call someone.</i>

03:12.760 --> 03:14.126
<i> It meant you were a fake,</i>
<i> a phony,</i>

03:14.128 --> 03:17.696
<i> or wearing the t-shirt of</i>
<i> a band you knew nothing about.</i>
(COUGHING)

03:17.698 --> 03:19.298
Poser.
I am not a poser.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.166
Social awareness
is super-important to me.

03:21.168 --> 03:24.136
I even got Principal Ball
to start a social awareness
club at school.

03:24.138 --> 03:27.906
Aw. It's just like when we saw
that <i> We Are The Earth</i> song.

03:27.908 --> 03:30.375
You got inspired
by music? Ha!

03:30.377 --> 03:31.310
I am not a poser, okay?

03:31.312 --> 03:34.746
You're the one
who pretends to be a rapper
and a Kara-Te master.

03:34.748 --> 03:36.114
I don't pretend anything.

03:36.116 --> 03:39.017
At my core,
I'm a break-dancing
samurai ninja

03:39.019 --> 03:41.320
who spits mad rhymes
and dunks mad jams.

03:41.322 --> 03:43.188
That's just a smorgasbord
of absurd things

03:43.190 --> 03:45.290
mashed together
in one ridiculous human.

03:45.292 --> 03:46.325
You want to know
what's ridiculous?

03:46.327 --> 03:51.296
That you think people would
actually care about your dumb
social awareness club,

03:51.298 --> 03:53.365
especially one
started by a poser.

03:53.367 --> 03:53.899
You're a poser!

03:53.901 --> 03:56.268
Copied my insult!
Ergo, you're a poser!

03:56.270 --> 03:57.069
Logic! Barry wins!

03:57.071 --> 03:59.071
You did not!
Erica wins!

03:59.073 --> 04:01.340
No, he won.
You copied him.

04:01.342 --> 04:03.141
It was weak, sweetheart.

04:03.143 --> 04:06.445
Have a slice of pizza
and be happy.

04:06.447 --> 04:09.014
ADULT ADAM: <i> While Barry</i>
<i> was tearing down Erica's idea,</i>

04:09.016 --> 04:10.682
<i> my mom was about</i>
<i> to try to build me up.</i>

04:10.684 --> 04:14.319
<i> Why don't we try to get</i>
<i> the chief in a good mood</i>
<i> for a change?</i>

04:14.321 --> 04:17.789
Nell Carter looks like
she gives great hugs.

04:18.659 --> 04:20.025
What's going on with you?

04:20.027 --> 04:21.927
GIRL: (ON TV)
<i> I hate dress...</i>

04:21.929 --> 04:22.728
Hey!
No!

04:22.730 --> 04:24.796
Guess who just had
a meeting with Coach Mellor.

04:24.798 --> 04:27.232
Apparently,
Adam is failing.

04:27.234 --> 04:29.534
I don't get it.
You used to love to swim.

04:29.536 --> 04:31.903
But I figured it out.
Really?

04:31.905 --> 04:33.305
Yeah.
It's your bathing suit.

04:33.307 --> 04:36.608
You're growing fast,
and it's pinching
your little coin purse.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.210
That's why I got you
these jams.

04:38.212 --> 04:41.647
Nice roomy
swim trunks for all
your bits and berries.

04:41.649 --> 04:44.850
Go on.
Model them for mama.

04:44.852 --> 04:45.817
I don't want
to model the jams.

04:45.819 --> 04:47.419
Come on.
They're jams.
I know they're jams.

04:47.421 --> 04:51.223
Well, then show us
how handsome you look
in your new jams.

04:51.225 --> 04:52.057
I don't want the jams.

04:52.059 --> 04:53.025
Come on.
They're jams.

04:53.027 --> 04:54.760
He doesn't want the damn jams!
Leave the boy alone already!

04:54.762 --> 04:58.563
Well, someone has
to address the issue
with his little marbles.

04:58.565 --> 05:01.199
Nobody wants their mom
talking about their yam bag.

05:01.201 --> 05:04.169
My God! The problem
isn't the swimsuit.

05:04.171 --> 05:07.072
It's just...
I hate taking off my shirt.

05:07.074 --> 05:07.606
Why?

05:07.608 --> 05:10.609
I'm ashamed of my body.
Okay?

05:11.612 --> 05:12.511
You're ashamed?

05:12.513 --> 05:15.180
Of this beautiful wall
of deliciousness?

05:15.182 --> 05:17.716
Those words
make it so much worse.

05:17.718 --> 05:18.784
I'm never swimming again.

05:18.786 --> 05:22.020
Even if George Lucas
invited me to a pool party

05:22.022 --> 05:26.224
in the swamps of Dagobah,
I'd still say no.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.461
I mean,
I'd go and check it out.

05:29.463 --> 05:31.897
How many chances do you have
to meet Yoda?

05:31.899 --> 05:33.832
But I would not go
into the pool.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.667
ADULT ADAM: <i> My mom hoped</i>
<i> she could save me.</i>

05:35.669 --> 05:37.803
<i> Meanwhile, my sister</i>
<i> was saving the world.</i>

05:37.805 --> 05:42.474
What's all this about?
It's the first meeting
of the social awareness club.

05:42.476 --> 05:43.075
Erica's dumb thing?

05:43.077 --> 05:45.444
But it's packed.
And with cool kids.
How's this possible?

05:45.446 --> 05:48.447
And that's when I decided
that I had to change
the world.

05:48.449 --> 05:51.583
Wait, she's getting
interviewed by the
<i> William Penn Mirror?</i>

05:51.585 --> 05:54.920
Come on. Don't get all
jealous 'cause your sister's
making news.

05:54.922 --> 05:58.957
And me eating 32 fish sticks
in the cafeteria isn't?

05:58.959 --> 06:01.259
This is
classic media bias!

06:01.261 --> 06:03.762
Please tell me the paper
is writing an article about

06:03.764 --> 06:05.397
how you're the biggest poser
in school.

06:05.399 --> 06:07.165
No, because
I'm not a poser.

06:07.167 --> 06:09.668
But I did tell them
that you were one, poser.

06:09.670 --> 06:13.171
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy on the p-word, huh?

06:13.173 --> 06:13.872
What is this, a disco?

06:13.874 --> 06:17.709
I really love my community
and want to give back,
but Erica won't let me.

06:17.711 --> 06:20.946
Please! He's joining
so that he can ruin my club
from the inside.

06:20.948 --> 06:24.549
You know, I think the <i> Mirror</i>
might be interested to know

06:24.551 --> 06:28.820
that a social awareness club
discriminates.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.122
What are you writing?

06:30.124 --> 06:31.623
We don't discriminate.

06:31.625 --> 06:34.292
Barry is welcome,
of course.

06:34.294 --> 06:36.395
You can quote me on that.

06:38.232 --> 06:39.765
Hmm.

06:41.468 --> 06:43.602
Okay, moving on
to our first fundraiser,

06:43.604 --> 06:46.505
I was thinking that a song
could inspire people,

06:46.507 --> 06:47.539
kind of like
<i> We Are The World.</i>

06:47.541 --> 06:51.943
I think that we focus
on one issue
that's super-important today,

06:51.945 --> 06:53.211
helping the people of Africa.

06:53.213 --> 06:54.513
Question.
What?

06:54.515 --> 06:56.081
Why do you get to pick
the issue?

06:56.083 --> 06:57.716
Because it's the
most important one.

06:57.718 --> 06:59.818
To you, but what about
the rainforest

06:59.820 --> 07:01.853
or raising awareness
for the ozone

07:01.855 --> 07:03.889
or why Air Jordans
are so expensive?

07:03.891 --> 07:05.424
Air Jordans?
That's not even a cause.

07:05.426 --> 07:08.427
You know, I think the <i> Mirror</i>
might be interested to know

07:08.429 --> 07:11.430
a social awareness club
is run by a dictator.

07:11.432 --> 07:13.832
No, just put Barry's ideas
in your song, Erica.

07:13.834 --> 07:16.935
Say, does anyone else have
an issue to be made aware of?

07:16.937 --> 07:18.303
Perhaps my wonderful
girlfriend has a few.

07:18.305 --> 07:21.973
Now that I think of it,
there are, like,
way too many nuclear weapons.

07:21.975 --> 07:23.375
Ooh! That's a good one.
Put it down.

07:23.377 --> 07:26.945
Yeah, but nuclear energy
is cleaner
than burning fossil fuels.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.413
That's true.
So write "Yes nukes."

07:28.415 --> 07:29.948
But I just wrote down
"No nukes."

07:29.950 --> 07:32.250
Who else has a cause?
Don't be shy.

07:32.252 --> 07:33.285
Save the whales, bro.
Gotta do it.

07:33.287 --> 07:36.588
Except the killer whales.
They're bad,
'cause they're killers.

07:36.590 --> 07:37.556
So, I guess
save some whales?

07:37.558 --> 07:40.959
That makes no sense.
Write it down!
Come on! Shout it out!

07:40.961 --> 07:41.893
There are no bad ideas.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.328
Poverty!
Scrunchies!

07:43.330 --> 07:44.129
Our town
needs a Bennigan's!

07:44.131 --> 07:45.764
JOHNNY: Spay and neuter.
NAKED ROB: Politics.

07:45.766 --> 07:46.498
ANDY: Acid rain.

07:46.500 --> 07:49.034
ADULT ADAM: <i> As Erica</i>
<i> was beginning to realize</i>
<i> she had a problem,</i>

07:49.036 --> 07:51.470
<i> my mom was trying</i>
<i> to solve mine.</i>

07:51.472 --> 07:53.705
What's shakin', bacon?
(SNAPPING)

07:53.707 --> 07:55.106
You up
for a little chat about

07:55.108 --> 07:59.044
Oh, I don't know,
<i> Star Wars,</i> robots,
your body, video games?

07:59.046 --> 08:00.278
Please, just go away.

08:00.280 --> 08:05.450
Okay, not until you look
at yourself in the mirror.
Come on.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.288
Drink it all in.

08:10.290 --> 08:14.359
Now say
"I have a beautiful body."

08:14.361 --> 08:16.061
Yeah, not gonna happen.

08:16.063 --> 08:16.595
Oh, it will.

08:16.597 --> 08:20.899
Look in the mirror
and tell that beautiful body
just how beautiful it is.

08:20.901 --> 08:22.100
You need to leave.

08:22.102 --> 08:22.701
Say it.

08:22.703 --> 08:26.171
No!
Say "I have
a beautiful body."

08:26.173 --> 08:27.272
Never!

08:27.274 --> 08:30.308
Let me show you
how it's done.
(CLEARS THROAT)

08:30.310 --> 08:32.410
I like my eyes
'cause they sparkle.

08:32.412 --> 08:36.681
I like my shoulders
'cause they look good with
or without pads. (CHUCKLES)

08:36.683 --> 08:39.684
I like my tummy
'cause it's where
I baked you.

08:39.686 --> 08:44.189
Make it stop!
Wait!
My little angel's a 10!

08:44.191 --> 08:45.657
You are a 10!

08:45.659 --> 08:47.058
You're a (BLEEP) 10!

08:47.060 --> 08:48.126
ADULT ADAM:
<i> After that debacle,</i>

08:48.128 --> 08:50.795
<i> I needed a laugh,</i>
<i> so I turned to the</i>
<i> funniest movie</i>

08:50.797 --> 08:54.132
<i> about a dancing gopher</i>
<i> ever made,</i> Caddyshack.

08:54.134 --> 08:56.935
<i> But instead of cracking me up,</i>
<i> it gave me an idea.</i>

08:56.937 --> 09:01.740
<i> I couldn't be expected</i>
<i> to swim if the pool</i>
<i> was suddenly shut down.</i>

09:01.742 --> 09:05.343
Those poor schmucks think
someone had an accident,

09:05.345 --> 09:07.279
but it's just a candy bar!

09:07.281 --> 09:09.014
This movie is a hoot!

09:09.016 --> 09:10.148
(POPS LAUGHING)

09:10.150 --> 09:12.150
Things are just getting good.
Where you going, kiddo?

09:12.152 --> 09:15.587
I suddenly got a craving
for a Baby Ruth.

09:15.589 --> 09:19.925
At 6:49 this morning,
our faithful janitor

09:19.927 --> 09:21.927
discovered a foreign object
in the pool.

09:21.929 --> 09:25.697
Initially, we thought
the object was

09:25.699 --> 09:27.232
organic in nature,

09:27.234 --> 09:31.069
so we followed school protocol
and drained the facilities.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.938
Upon closer inspection,
we determined

09:32.940 --> 09:37.342
that the floater in question
was, in fact, a candy bar.

09:37.344 --> 09:38.076
(ALL LAUGH)

09:38.078 --> 09:40.946
Laugh it up, chuckleheads,
but Caddyshacking a pool

09:40.948 --> 09:43.248
is a serious offense.
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)

09:43.250 --> 09:44.983
I said no press!

09:44.985 --> 09:45.850
Damn it.

09:45.852 --> 09:47.218
Now this is gonna be
all over the <i> Mirror.</i>

09:47.220 --> 09:49.220
(ALL LAUGH)
ADULT ADAM:
<i> My plan had worked.</i>

09:49.222 --> 09:53.391
<i> The question was, how long</i>
<i> could I get away with it?</i>

09:53.393 --> 09:55.460
(PIANO PLAYING)
<i> ¶ We don't want</i>
<i> a nuclear winter</i>

09:55.462 --> 09:59.230
<i> ¶ That's why we need</i>
<i> a nuclear freeze</i>

09:59.232 --> 10:01.266
<i> ¶ I know</i>
<i> that's confusing... ¶</i>

10:01.268 --> 10:03.468
God. What the hell
rhymes with "freeze"?

10:03.470 --> 10:05.437
Did someone say "Barry"?

10:05.439 --> 10:06.037
Get out!

10:06.039 --> 10:07.906
Because of you,
I have to write
a ridiculous song

10:07.908 --> 10:09.207
about every issue
in the world.

10:09.209 --> 10:13.979
Chill, girl.
Big Tasty's got the answer
to all your problems.

10:13.981 --> 10:14.980
Merch.

10:14.982 --> 10:16.114
Go away!

10:16.116 --> 10:16.748
Just hear me out.

10:16.750 --> 10:20.118
Songs are cute,
but if you want to start
making real cheddar,

10:20.120 --> 10:21.353
merch is where it's at.

10:21.355 --> 10:22.020
Why are you still here?

10:22.022 --> 10:26.825
Did you know
the Rolling Stones make 93%
of their money on t-shirts?

10:26.827 --> 10:28.460
And the other 22%?

10:28.462 --> 10:29.361
Stickers!

10:29.363 --> 10:30.629
Merch, baby!
Merch!

10:30.631 --> 10:32.564
I'm not doing
a thing you say.

10:32.566 --> 10:33.231
Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup.

10:33.233 --> 10:36.668
Reserve your judgment
until you see the back.

10:36.670 --> 10:37.602
Are you kidding me?

10:37.604 --> 10:40.171
Your merch is all about
getting you sneakers.

10:40.173 --> 10:40.639
Exactly!

10:40.641 --> 10:43.341
You see, at first, I thought
you were just some dumb poser,

10:43.343 --> 10:45.443
but then I realized
your dumb poser crap

10:45.445 --> 10:46.444
can help get me
my Air Jordans.

10:46.446 --> 10:49.981
That's it! I don't care
what the Principal says.
You're out of my club.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.116
You can't do that!
I just did.

10:51.118 --> 10:53.885
Oh-ho. The <i> Mirror's</i> gonna have
a field day with you, poser.

10:53.887 --> 10:56.421
Call me "poser" all you want.
I don't care anymore.

10:56.423 --> 11:00.091
In fact, you are worse
than a poser.
All you are is a joke.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.459
Oh, we'll see
who the joke is

11:01.461 --> 11:06.564
once I start my own
rival social awareness club
to raise money for barity.

11:06.566 --> 11:08.099
Barity?
That's not a thing.

11:08.101 --> 11:11.202
It's a Barry charity.
A barity.

11:11.204 --> 11:13.338
And it will crush
your charity.

11:14.307 --> 11:15.373
Wha...

11:15.375 --> 11:18.376
Stop! Barry!

11:18.378 --> 11:19.511
Stop it!

11:19.513 --> 11:20.378
All right, listen up!

11:20.380 --> 11:24.516
I figured keeping you here
hours after class
would flush out our prankster.

11:24.518 --> 11:26.217
Alvin, our janitor,
gave me that pun.

11:26.219 --> 11:31.289
If the culprit doesn't
come forward by next class,
you will all be punished!

11:31.291 --> 11:33.324
But know this,
I will find you.

11:33.326 --> 11:34.659
ADULT ADAM:
<i> My time was running out,</i>

11:34.661 --> 11:36.861
<i> so my only option</i>
<i> was to create confusion.</i>

11:36.863 --> 11:39.998
Whoever did this,
stop being a putz
and just admit it.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.534
Honestly, dude,
we were all kind
of thinking it was you.

11:42.536 --> 11:45.537
Guys, it can't be me.
That would be too obvious.

11:45.539 --> 11:48.473
It's always the last person
that you suspect.

11:48.709 --> 11:49.874
Don't nod at me.

11:49.876 --> 11:51.476
Everyone knows
Dave Kim's allergic to nuts.

11:51.478 --> 11:55.447
And how do you just happen
to know that candy bar
had nuts?

11:55.449 --> 11:56.681
They all have nuts!

11:56.683 --> 11:58.016
Not Milky Way.
That's nougat.

11:58.018 --> 12:01.486
Nougat is nuts!
You're making that up.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.655
The primary ingredients
in nougat are

12:03.657 --> 12:05.156
sugar, nuts,
and egg whites.

12:05.158 --> 12:09.594
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Like a criminal mastermind,</i>
<i> I had created confusion,</i>

12:09.596 --> 12:10.295
<i> and it was glorious.</i>

12:10.297 --> 12:13.631
<i> But Erica was about to create</i>
<i> confusion of a different kind.</i>

12:13.633 --> 12:15.567
Hey, Lainey.
Yeah, Erica?

12:15.569 --> 12:17.102
When did the earth die?

12:17.104 --> 12:17.635
TOGETHER: Today.

He gave me all the
day-old doughnuts
they were gonna trash.

You people are eating
garbage pastries.

Why don't you write a song
about it, Bob Dylan?

13:58.438 --> 13:59.037

one doughnut at a time.

Fine. I give up.

You're the poser, not me.

14:10.717 --> 14:13.484

you were right.

two long, swimless days,

14:28.869 --> 14:33.738
and our prankster
still hasn't admitted
to Caddyshacking the pool.

14:33.740 --> 14:35.707
Until our culprit
comes forward,

14:35.709 --> 14:40.612
you will all run laps

we run laps
instead of swimming?

That's right.
Nice!

14:47.687 --> 14:48.686
Wait, hold on.
Stop, stop, stop.

14:48.688 --> 14:53.591
You're telling me you'd rather
run laps indefinitely
than get in the pool?

14:53.760 --> 14:54.659
ALL: Yeah.

14:54.661 --> 14:56.394
ADAM: Yeah
Yeah. That's good.

14:56.396 --> 14:57.896
Well, in that case

swimming for the
rest of the year!

14:59.733 --> 15:02.967
We can't just swim all year.
What about basketball?

15:02.969 --> 15:04.202
It'll be water basketball.

Okay, fine.
I know who did it.

The other day
after class, Adam...

15:17.984 --> 15:20.752
...made us realize
it was Dave Kim.

15:20.754 --> 15:21.753
What?

15:21.755 --> 15:23.021
I didn't see that coming.

15:23.023 --> 15:24.389
Dave Kim, my office.

15:24.391 --> 15:27.325
It's a setup!
It couldn't
have been me!

Maybe we're being
a little hasty.

You can't protect him
now, Goldfarb.

15:33.934 --> 15:35.767
He made his choice.

15:35.769 --> 15:38.870
Not so funny now,
are you, candyman?

15:45.178 --> 15:47.278

Hey!

15:48.882 --> 15:51.082
"Caddyshame"?

15:51.084 --> 15:52.984
Dave Kim is guilty?

15:52.986 --> 15:53.751

Dave Kim is
allergic to nuts,

15:56.890 --> 15:57.889
and nougat is nuts.

15:57.891 --> 16:00.758
No, this has Adam
written all over it.

16:00.760 --> 16:03.561
We've watched that movie
a million times.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.229
No! Adam wouldn't do that.

16:05.231 --> 16:08.833
I solved his problems
by forcing him
to love his body.

16:08.835 --> 16:12.203
Nobody wants to hear
that sort of thing
from their mother.

16:12.205 --> 16:12.971
Well, if that's true,

16:12.973 --> 16:15.840
then I suppose he needs
to hear it from his father.

16:15.842 --> 16:16.741
Or his grandfather.

16:16.743 --> 16:19.677
I'm not saying that
weird stuff to the boy.

16:19.679 --> 16:20.445

16:20.447 --> 16:22.580
Murray, you need
to do this!

16:22.582 --> 16:26.050
Now go up there and tell him
he has a beautiful body

he doesn't.

16:39.165 --> 16:39.731
What?

16:39.733 --> 16:41.032
To tell you
you got a beautiful body.

16:41.034 --> 16:43.267
What?
You know, that you got
a beautiful body.

16:43.269 --> 16:47.005
See, you keep trailing off,

16:47.007 --> 16:48.673
You got a beautiful body.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.942
This body of yours...
Beautiful!

16:50.944 --> 16:53.044
Don't ever
tell me that again!

16:53.046 --> 16:55.346
Deal. But...

16:55.348 --> 16:56.848
Let's be truthful.

16:56.850 --> 17:00.385
You don't have
a beautiful body.
Thanks.

17:00.387 --> 17:02.120
You're in middle school.

17:02.122 --> 17:05.790
Your body,
it's stinky and greasy

17:05.792 --> 17:07.458

17:07.460 --> 17:11.963
And when you talk,
it's...it's like a...

17:17.771 --> 17:19.103
Since when have
you had a shred

17:19.105 --> 17:21.172
of insecurity
about your body?

17:21.174 --> 17:24.275
You'll go anywhere
in your tighty-whities.

17:24.277 --> 17:24.909
That's now.

17:24.911 --> 17:27.745
When I was your age,
I hated my body.

17:27.747 --> 17:29.747
The good news is,
I grew up,

17:29.749 --> 17:31.849
and life beat me down
so hard

17:31.851 --> 17:33.885
that I eventually
stopped caring.

17:33.887 --> 17:37.722
And someday, life will
crap on you so hard

17:37.724 --> 17:40.191
that you'll stop
caring, too!

17:40.193 --> 17:42.693
That's...
Oddly comforting.

17:42.695 --> 17:43.728
Trust me.

17:43.730 --> 17:44.495
Eventually, you'll realize

17:44.497 --> 17:46.297
it doesn't matter
what other people think.

like to say

17:57.377 --> 18:00.978
before you begin
your aquatic odyssey?

18:00.980 --> 18:02.880
I didn't do it.

18:04.484 --> 18:07.085

18:07.087 --> 18:08.152
Wait.

18:08.154 --> 18:11.055
I did it.
I caddyshacked the pool.

Innocent!

18:12.826 --> 18:15.259
Look, this wasn't
some prank.

18:15.261 --> 18:18.429
I did it
because I hate swimming.

18:18.431 --> 18:19.063
We all do.

18:19.065 --> 18:21.799
We dread having to
wear our swimsuits
in front of each other

18:21.801 --> 18:25.570
because we feel super-weird
about our super-weird bodies.

18:25.572 --> 18:29.507
So if it's a crime
to be self-conscious,

18:29.509 --> 18:31.409
then I guess I'm guilty.

18:31.411 --> 18:33.511
But just ask yourself...

18:33.513 --> 18:36.814
Isn't that
punishment enough?

18:36.816 --> 18:39.484
No. A month's detention.

18:39.486 --> 18:40.351
Balls.

18:40.353 --> 18:42.053
As for
the rest of you...

18:42.055 --> 18:43.354

18:43.356 --> 18:45.256
ALL: Yeah.

18:45.258 --> 18:46.190
All right, look.

Others just look like
a sack of paste.

how you feel,
then I am willing

18:59.839 --> 19:02.473

a little more comfortable.

19:16.923 --> 19:18.389

your Air Jordan money.

19:18.391 --> 19:19.657
Why would you
give this to me?

a poser, but so am I.

it looks like it,

safe with me.

and so are all our friends.

trying to figure it out.
