JP: Wow, Craig, I don't know if

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
it's this light that you're in

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
or that huge poop you just took,

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
but you are glowing, buddy.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
Guys! Guys, you're back!

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
So, Craig, how do you feel?

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
Amazing. Like a new boy.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Also, your dad says hi,

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
and he treasures every day with you?

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
Huh?

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
So, what did you do while I was --

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
while I was pooping?

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Oh, let's see if you can guess.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Oh, you tried on a bunch of different hats

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
and pretended to be a hat model?

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Oh, wait. Did you -- Did you go swimming in the creek

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
and get a leech on your foot?

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Oh, I know!

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Uh, you took some time to do some personal writing.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
Then you went outside to sharpen your sword.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Wow, JP, you -- you got it.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
But then you got distracted by a squirrel...

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Uh-huh.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
...and chased the leaves it was dropping

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
from the trees... I did that, too.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
...and ended up at the meadow...

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
I don't understand how you know all this.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
...and ran through the grass...

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Yeah.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
...and tumbled down a hill...

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Yep.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
...and embraced the serenity of nature.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
I mean, that's pretty much exact.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Then you went to steal some seeds

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
from that one guy's backyard,

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
but you nearly got sprayed by his sprinkler.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
-Whoa. -And you narrowly escaped.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
You're blowing my mind, buddy.
