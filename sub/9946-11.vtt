WEBVTT

00:03.138 --> 00:05.641
Tickets this way
for the Chatsworth Express.

00:05.640 --> 00:10.714
Come and watch pikeys making
a mess of the lives they

00:12.215 --> 00:14.638
were given by 'im upstairs.

00:14.628 --> 00:18.064
And kids they're convinced
aren't actually theirs.

00:18.056 --> 00:19.148
Stay away!

00:19.142 --> 00:21.667
What sounds on Earth
could ever replace...

00:21.660 --> 00:22.934
Oi!

00:22.924 --> 00:25.904
..kids needing money
or wives in your face?

00:25.895 --> 00:29.592
Cos this, people reckon -
and me included -

00:29.592 --> 00:33.380
is why pubs and drugs
were kindly invented.

00:33.374 --> 00:37.162
To calm us all down to
stop us going mental.

00:37.156 --> 00:41.536
These are Chatsworth Estate's
basic essentials.

00:41.529 --> 00:43.747
We are worth every penny.

00:43.745 --> 00:48.045
For grinding your
axes you shit on our head.

00:48.141 --> 00:50.441
But you pay the taxes.

00:53.399 --> 00:57.062
Imagine a Britain without
Chatsworth buccaneers

00:57.055 --> 00:59.478
who'd come on your face
for the price of a beer.

00:59.478 --> 01:03.619
Make poverty history!
Cheaper drugs now!

01:03.612 --> 01:06.001
Make poverty history!

01:05.994 --> 01:07.507
Cheaper drugs now!

01:09.000 --> 01:15.074

01:24.279 --> 01:26.053
Had double maths today.

01:26.043 --> 01:28.159
We had to make up our own sums.

01:28.154 --> 01:31.692
Peter Brannigan calculated how many
times a bloke will masturbate

01:31.687 --> 01:33.700
during their lifetime.

01:33.696 --> 01:36.540
He didn't use that word though.

01:36.533 --> 01:38.296
Got a detention.

01:38.294 --> 01:40.467
I worked out
the total number of days

01:40.460 --> 01:44.305
I spent with Mum
before she left. Twice.

01:44.301 --> 01:46.952
Hiya, love.

01:46.941 --> 01:48.351
Came to 1,976.

01:48.348 --> 01:48.712
Made your favourite.

01:48.712 --> 01:52.716
Not great when you consider
I've been on the planet for 4,382.

01:52.709 --> 01:56.224
Makes you want
to become self-sufficient.

01:56.225 --> 01:58.170
You know,
cope with stuff on your own.

01:58.160 --> 02:01.232
Means no-one will ever
let you down again.

02:01.226 --> 02:02.705
Oh, and in case you're wondering,

02:02.701 --> 02:07.627
it's 5,783 - the number of times
a bloke will, you know.

02:07.626 --> 02:10.481
What they teaching you
at school - how to be a twat?

02:10.482 --> 02:12.461
She's been cooking all afternoon.

02:12.458 --> 02:12.935
Didn't ask her to.

02:12.926 --> 02:15.906
She's bending over backwards.
Show some respect.

02:15.897 --> 02:17.558
She's trying to impress Dad.

02:17.551 --> 02:21.612
Grow up! They're here to stay,
so get used to it.

02:21.604 --> 02:23.424
I'll give them a month.

02:23.417 --> 02:27.638
Stella loves having them here,
never seen her so happy.

02:27.632 --> 02:31.295
Sleeping through for the first time
ever. Don't fuck it up for her!

02:34.846 --> 02:36.848
DOORBELL RINGS

02:36.842 --> 02:38.594
Hold yer friggin' horses!

02:46.924 --> 02:48.505
Dad found out I'm gay.

02:48.499 --> 02:51.525
I left a porno in the bathroom
and he went schizo.

02:51.518 --> 02:52.587
He did that?!

02:54.400 --> 02:56.004
I'm going round there.

02:56.002 --> 02:57.401
No! He's lost the plot.

02:57.392 --> 02:58.245
Didn't Mum do anything?

02:58.240 --> 03:01.118
She wasn't there.
She hasn't been for a month.

03:01.110 --> 03:03.761
She's run off with another bloke.

03:03.753 --> 03:06.108
And nobody bothered to tell me?
Thanks(!)

03:06.106 --> 03:08.745
I don't want to go back there
until he's calmed down.

03:12.117 --> 03:13.891
Stay here for a few days.

03:13.886 --> 03:15.353
Cheers, mate.

03:15.345 --> 03:16.141
You can sleep with me.

03:17.791 --> 03:20.055
Top to tail.

03:20.046 --> 03:22.219
So, how did your dads react
when they found out?

03:26.561 --> 03:28.461
What - they don't know?

03:28.460 --> 03:30.997
I'm just waiting for
the right moment, you know.

03:30.987 --> 03:31.954
There's no point telling him
any more.

03:31.952 --> 03:33.362
What do you mean?

03:34.489 --> 03:36.878
We're seeing each other.

03:36.871 --> 03:37.792
Fuck me! So you're bi?

03:39.206 --> 03:40.707
Just found the right person.

03:40.700 --> 03:42.110
(RETCHES)

03:44.777 --> 03:46.722
Oi, greedy arse,
you going to pass that or what?

03:58.743 --> 04:01.257
I didn't hear your dad come in.

04:01.254 --> 04:01.959
He didn't.

04:01.951 --> 04:03.316
So who's that for? Me.

04:03.313 --> 04:04.405
No, you don't. It's illegal.

04:03.313 --> 04:06.498
You can't tell me what to do.

04:06.491 --> 04:09.346
What is it with you, Liam?
Do you know what?

04:09.344 --> 04:10.572
Don't bother speaking at all

04:10.566 --> 04:13.148
if you're going to be
a cheeky little prick.

04:16.914 --> 04:18.120
'Night, love.

04:23.788 --> 04:27.667
Now, that's what I call service!

04:28.995 --> 04:32.544
I'll be wanting some money
off this. Got a dint in it.

04:32.542 --> 04:34.863
Yeah, I know. I saw you do it.
Full price.

04:34.861 --> 04:36.704
10p cheaper at Cost Chopper.

04:36.695 --> 04:39.289
Piss off to Cost Chopper, then!

04:39.289 --> 04:41.120
I'll be buying me girls' condoms
elsewhere an' all!

04:44.993 --> 04:46.517
You're going to have to stop

04:46.517 --> 04:49.281
taking your sexual frustration
out on customers.

04:49.274 --> 04:50.718
Jamie still making the earth move?

04:50.710 --> 04:53.213
Yeah, I've got
a great sex life, thanks.

04:53.212 --> 04:56.124
Really - so when did you last come?

05:05.816 --> 05:08.614
How many times, Joe? It's over.

05:08.613 --> 05:12.333
You're doing my fucking head in.
This is getting sorted out.

05:16.200 --> 05:17.599
It's already sorted.

05:17.594 --> 05:19.915
I'm with the bloke
that I want to be with.

05:19.915 --> 05:21.086
Yeah? Deal with it.

05:22.335 --> 05:23.279
Right.

05:24.939 --> 05:27.169
I will!

05:39.547 --> 05:41.026
Morning, love.

05:51.510 --> 05:53.671
Made any friends at big school?

05:56.618 --> 05:58.620
You're welcome
to invite them back.

05:58.612 --> 06:00.580
As long as they aren't gingas.

06:00.571 --> 06:01.265
What about your breakfast?

06:01.255 --> 06:01.994
I'm all right.

06:03.781 --> 06:05.373
I'm worried about him.

06:05.373 --> 06:06.431
Worry's like a rocking chair -

06:06.422 --> 06:10.074
gives you something to do
but never fucking gets you anywhere.

06:10.074 --> 06:11.314
Needs his cherry popping.

06:11.304 --> 06:15.252
I think it's obvious what
his behaviour's signifying.

06:15.244 --> 06:16.404
He needs mothering.

06:16.394 --> 06:18.248
Have to bloody find her first.

06:23.252 --> 06:24.810
Bit early, innit?

06:24.800 --> 06:27.052
I'm still in a bit of pain.

06:27.047 --> 06:29.584
You need to be discreet
to survive around here.

06:29.574 --> 06:32.941
Anyone finds out you're a mincer,
your life won't be worth living.

06:32.931 --> 06:35.161
So just follow my lead,

06:35.151 --> 06:37.358
and if a bloke catches you
perving...

06:38.438 --> 06:41.373
What you looking at, faggot?!

06:41.362 --> 06:44.479
..there's only one way out of it.

06:44.475 --> 06:46.670
I don't know,
but you're looking at a Maguire.

06:49.700 --> 06:51.486
Bruce!

07:13.458 --> 07:17.269
I don't know what you bothered
changing the locks for.

07:17.268 --> 07:20.453
He'll never want
to step foot in here again!

07:20.447 --> 07:22.802
So he thought
he'd come crawling to you?

07:22.799 --> 07:24.585
He couldn't exactly get very far!

07:24.582 --> 07:28.439
You haven't got a bloody clue
what things have been like.

07:28.438 --> 07:29.723
Turning your back on your son!

07:29.719 --> 07:32.381
He smokes that shit
from the minute he wakes up...

07:32.379 --> 07:35.758
Oh, right, so you chucked
him out for being a stoner.

07:35.749 --> 07:38.024
He needed a wake-up call, the loser!

07:38.019 --> 07:40.931
Coward!
You're just making up excuses

07:40.921 --> 07:43.640
to cover up for the fact that you
threw him out because he's gay.

07:45.591 --> 07:47.218
Bruce is what?

07:47.212 --> 07:49.680
Pathetic! I'm glad
Mum's seen the light.

07:49.675 --> 07:54.271
She should've left you years ago.
What - you going to give me
a crack as well?

07:54.267 --> 07:55.791
What the fuck
has he been telling you?

08:10.655 --> 08:11.940
I'm going to call the police.

08:11.936 --> 08:13.244
He's probably at Homework Club.

08:13.238 --> 08:14.808
It's nearly ten!

08:14.803 --> 08:16.919
He could be at a friend's.

08:16.912 --> 08:19.198
I don't like this,
he's not been himself.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.206
Oh, cheers, great welcome.

08:23.204 --> 08:26.583
Liam's not home from school yet.

08:26.576 --> 08:28.760
Probably run off -
wouldn't be the first time.

08:28.750 --> 08:30.763
I knew a lad who ran
away to London once.

08:30.756 --> 08:34.408
Ended up living in the slums,
forced into a life of crime.

08:34.405 --> 08:35.929
That'll be Oliver Twist.

08:35.929 --> 08:37.590
He'll be back when he wants feeding.

08:37.580 --> 08:41.493
You ever thought of entering
Father Of The Year(?)

08:41.486 --> 08:44.024
You read about all sorts.
Anything could've happened.

08:44.017 --> 08:46.144
You are a little
ray of sunshine, Patty.

08:46.144 --> 08:47.748
DOOR OPENS

08:47.748 --> 08:50.205
Oh, thank God!

08:53.988 --> 08:56.570
We thought you were
heading somewhere exotic.

08:56.564 --> 08:58.862
So where've you been?

08:58.853 --> 08:59.456
Out.

08:59.450 --> 09:03.181
I thought we could go into town
on Saturday. Just you and me.

09:03.179 --> 09:04.817
Who's she?

09:04.816 --> 09:06.397
Wayne Dobson's little sister.

09:06.389 --> 09:08.220
Thought you two could play.

09:08.220 --> 09:09.721
I'm 11!

09:09.715 --> 09:12.024
No, I mean go and...

09:12.016 --> 09:13.153
"play".

09:17.431 --> 09:21.595
Would you like me
to read you a bedtime story?

09:32.349 --> 09:33.543
So, were you in the army?

09:33.533 --> 09:35.967
RAF.

09:35.962 --> 09:37.247
What plane did you fly?

09:38.896 --> 09:41.694
Spitfire.

09:41.684 --> 09:42.821
What was the name of your squadron?

09:42.819 --> 09:44.992
This is worse than
the bloody Gestapo.

09:44.992 --> 09:48.439
Your school said
it'd only take half hour.

09:48.438 --> 09:49.587
I don't want to do
this any more than you do -

09:49.582 --> 09:52.813
I wanted someone from World War I,
but they're all dead.

09:52.808 --> 09:56.539
Stupid bloody soldiers
and stupid bloody wars.

09:56.533 --> 09:58.114
"We make war that we
may live in peace."

09:58.107 --> 10:00.769
Aristotle.

10:00.791 --> 10:04.431
Be lot less bother if people
actually talked,

10:04.430 --> 10:06.398
told each other what was wrong.

10:06.391 --> 10:09.690
Like Churchill said,
"Less war war, more jaw jaw."

10:15.633 --> 10:17.498
(COUGHS)

10:20.606 --> 10:22.335
(WHEEZES)

10:26.266 --> 10:29.155
Piss off if you're going.

10:29.152 --> 10:31.655
How long've you got?

10:31.651 --> 10:33.004
I said piss off.

10:56.453 --> 10:58.956
You've done this before.

10:58.952 --> 11:01.113
I'm surrounded by cabbages at home.

11:09.115 --> 11:11.060
I'd better go.

11:11.059 --> 11:14.096
Your teacher said
you'd fail this module

11:14.090 --> 11:17.389
if you didn't get this assignment in.

11:17.384 --> 11:20.057
Come tomorrow, huh?

11:22.074 --> 11:24.713
Let yourself in. Any time.

11:31.600 --> 11:32.771
Do you ever get any gay boys in here?

11:35.664 --> 11:36.790
Only the ones who
like hospital food.

11:36.787 --> 11:39.381
What you drinking?

11:39.381 --> 11:40.905
Better have a pint.

11:40.905 --> 11:43.282
Two pints, please, Karen.

12:05.254 --> 12:07.267
Straight enough for you?

12:07.264 --> 12:10.074
You don't have to go overboard.

12:10.069 --> 12:13.379
Mam, this is Bruce, Maxine's
brother. He's staying with us.

12:13.377 --> 12:17.939
About time we had a bit of eye candy
round here, aye, Karen?

12:17.932 --> 12:19.285
Mimi Maguire.

12:19.275 --> 12:20.993
Oh, Katie's nana?

12:20.982 --> 12:22.688
You must really miss her.

12:22.685 --> 12:25.301
Feel like I've had
me heart ripped out.

12:25.292 --> 12:27.556
I hear she doted on you.

12:27.547 --> 12:30.357
I was always in her nightmares.

12:30.352 --> 12:32.092
Saving her from the monsters, like.

12:34.095 --> 12:38.225
Good-looking lad like you could
have her with the click of a finger.

12:39.363 --> 12:42.924
She's not got the right bits.

12:42.914 --> 12:43.801
He means she's not his type.

12:43.792 --> 12:45.760
He likes big tits,
not fried eggs.

12:45.751 --> 12:47.503
I'm gay.

12:51.390 --> 12:52.926
Urgh!

12:55.300 --> 12:58.758
Better stick some Kylie on the
jukebox for the fudge-packer.

12:58.752 --> 13:01.289
LAUGHTER

13:08.839 --> 13:11.888
LAUGHTER

13:16.022 --> 13:19.173
Go on, get on with it.
Give him a fuck.

13:19.163 --> 13:22.394
He only went and told
everyone he's a Mary!

13:23.880 --> 13:27.714
I just wish you'd had the bloody
decency to tell me first.

13:27.709 --> 13:28.528
I'm not really.

13:29.701 --> 13:30.781
I saw you in the pub.

13:30.774 --> 13:31.945
I was just having a laugh.

13:31.938 --> 13:35.135
So why did you tell everyone
that's why I kicked you out?

13:35.134 --> 13:37.750
I kicked him out to force
him to sort himself out.

13:40.434 --> 13:40.718
Make-up!

13:40.710 --> 13:42.689
You snidey little...

13:42.689 --> 13:47.331
We all tell porkies occasionally.
He's not a doctor. He isn't anything.

13:55.139 --> 13:58.074
You complete fuck-up.

13:58.071 --> 13:59.390
I needed somewhere to...

14:09.131 --> 14:11.042
Going to miss footie practice
tonight.

14:11.040 --> 14:12.291
You, miss footie?

14:13.602 --> 14:14.990
He must be seeing a bird.

14:19.991 --> 14:20.901
Well, are ya?

14:20.897 --> 14:22.797
Yeah.

14:26.814 --> 14:29.931
Mimi, any chance of you sticking
this one on the slate?

14:29.926 --> 14:33.293
Same chance
as me sitting on yer face.

14:33.285 --> 14:38.291
The milk of human kindness curdles
and turns slowly sour.

14:41.923 --> 14:43.595
Yes, mate?

14:43.590 --> 14:45.387
Pint and a whisky chaser. Double.

14:49.075 --> 14:52.465
It's like a jungle out there,

14:52.461 --> 14:55.419
sometimes I wonder
how I keep from going under.

14:57.582 --> 15:01.780
So, well, they say a problem
shared is a problem halved.

15:04.589 --> 15:05.487
Could you get him a drink?

15:05.479 --> 15:08.357
Oh, cheers. You're a gent.
Frank Gallagher.

15:08.348 --> 15:10.361
Ian's father?

15:10.358 --> 15:12.474
Well, sort of.

15:12.467 --> 15:14.526
Cameron Donnelly. Maxine's dad.

15:14.524 --> 15:18.096
Oh, hoh, the meeting of the in-laws!
Mimi, line them up.

15:18.094 --> 15:22.918
Need to celebrate the coming
together of two noble tribes.

15:22.909 --> 15:25.173
Great. Cheers, mate.

15:29.601 --> 15:32.024
So, either your missus has left you,

15:32.017 --> 15:33.234
or you've just discovered
your son's a poof.

15:33.234 --> 15:35.407
Both.

15:35.405 --> 15:38.294
Shit! Two emergency Es, Mimi.

15:38.293 --> 15:41.069
What would you do if you
found out your son was bent?

15:41.063 --> 15:42.883
Actually...

15:45.738 --> 15:46.989
..I don't think I'd mind.

15:46.981 --> 15:49.529
Well, it has its advantages,
doesn't it?

15:49.526 --> 15:50.311
They don't have nippers,

15:50.304 --> 15:53.796
so you 'aven't got robbing
grandkids bleeding you dry.

15:53.791 --> 15:57.113
They've got lots of girlie mates,
so you've got plenty to ogle at.

15:57.111 --> 16:00.217
And statistically they die younger,
you know, AIDS and shit.

16:00.209 --> 16:05.806
They may come into a bit of money,
plus you'd never have to run a
Hoover across the house again -

16:05.803 --> 16:07.668
they like a nice clean home,
don't they?

16:07.667 --> 16:10.181
Hey, what would you do, Paddy,

16:10.180 --> 16:12.250
if you discovered one of
your lads was a fruit?

16:12.250 --> 16:13.820
I'd do the right thing.

16:15.626 --> 16:16.763
I'd put him out of his misery.

16:38.680 --> 16:40.682
You're going to fuckin' night school!

16:40.673 --> 16:43.130
What the hell are you
doing following me?

16:43.121 --> 16:44.554
Just wanted to see
what she looked like.

16:44.549 --> 16:48.508
Where is she?
Finishing off her macrame basket?

16:48.506 --> 16:51.669
What's this?

16:51.667 --> 16:54.192
I have to write down all
the times I get narked.

16:54.187 --> 16:56.303
I'm doing an anger management
course.

16:56.302 --> 16:59.089
Yeah, right!

17:01.216 --> 17:02.308
So there's no girlfriend?

17:07.163 --> 17:07.992
Look, if you're doing this for me...

17:07.989 --> 17:09.991
I'm not.

17:09.983 --> 17:13.464
I need to sort meself out.
I know I've got a problem.

17:13.454 --> 17:14.637
You could've told me.

17:14.636 --> 17:16.330
It's none of your business.

17:16.323 --> 17:18.063
It is if you're talking
about me in there.

17:18.055 --> 17:19.146
I talk about me.

17:20.816 --> 17:22.477
You can't do this on your own.
I can help.

17:22.469 --> 17:23.935
Leave it.

17:30.215 --> 17:33.821
Oh, thank the Lord. I've phoned
all the hospitals, Frank.

17:33.815 --> 17:34.315
That's a strange habit.

17:34.305 --> 17:36.819
Like a dog - always finds
his way home eventually.

17:36.814 --> 17:37.974
Come sit down, Ray.

17:37.965 --> 17:39.705
Oh!

17:39.702 --> 17:42.296
DRUNKEN LAUGHTER

17:42.292 --> 17:46.331
Hey, didn't realise Tories
knew how to party!

17:46.330 --> 17:49.322
CAM-ER-0NI CAM-ER-0NI CAM-ER-0NI

17:49.313 --> 17:51.076
Where were you again last night?

17:51.076 --> 17:52.623
I think he's got a girlfriend.

17:52.621 --> 17:53.167
Ooohhh!

17:53.158 --> 17:56.013
We don't all need adoration
to mask our insecurities.

17:56.009 --> 18:00.434
It's not, it's not a problem
if she's a minger, son.

18:00.434 --> 18:01.947
We all have to start somewhere.

18:01.940 --> 18:03.692
I was at Reggie's.

18:03.691 --> 18:06.034
Bring him round.
Want to see if he's as geeky as you.

18:06.028 --> 18:07.541
He can't walk.

18:07.535 --> 18:10.333
You don't want to be hanging
around with a raspberry ripple, son.

18:10.323 --> 18:12.359
It's crap for your street cred.

18:12.350 --> 18:14.557
He doesn't go to my school.

18:14.557 --> 18:17.503
Even worse! Kid from another school,
you got to beat the shit out of 'em.

18:17.499 --> 18:19.797
Oh, don't do that again, sir...

18:19.791 --> 18:22.567
He doesn't go to any school.
He's 84.

18:24.833 --> 18:29.896
What are you doing spending all
your time with a coffin-dodger for?

18:29.892 --> 18:34.761
You know what for. You signed
the consent form for school.

18:34.755 --> 18:36.302
I just don't show up
on your radar, do I?

18:36.295 --> 18:39.549
Who is he, where's he live?

18:41.678 --> 18:46.240
Come here, give me the bag,
give me... Give me the bag!

18:46.233 --> 18:47.257
No! It's mine.

18:49.448 --> 18:51.632
What's this?

18:51.626 --> 18:53.856
When did this come?

18:53.851 --> 18:56.763
We're all worried sick about her
and you kept this to yourself!?

18:56.753 --> 18:57.765
Easy, Carl.

18:57.758 --> 18:58.998
Four days ago!

18:58.993 --> 19:02.679
Debbie sent it to me,
it's mine, it's private.

19:02.672 --> 19:06.403
"Dear Liam, hope you lot haven't
burnt the bloody house down.

19:06.399 --> 19:10.074
"By the time you read this
I'll be in Afghanistan,

19:10.070 --> 19:12.140
"just been told
I've been posted there."

19:12.139 --> 19:14.152
Is this what you've
been worried about?

19:15.852 --> 19:17.717
Afghanistan!

19:17.717 --> 19:19.161
Liam, if you need to talk.

19:20.601 --> 19:25.004
If you're after getting
something off your chest,

19:24.994 --> 19:26.746
some sort of touchy feely nonsense,

19:26.745 --> 19:28.588
you've come to the wrong place.

19:28.579 --> 19:31.969
All I'm after's a bit of privacy,
so that's fine by me.

19:31.964 --> 19:35.445
You're having a bad time,
don't worry, it won't last forever.

19:44.198 --> 19:45.813
What the hell's this?

19:45.809 --> 19:48.164
It's for you,
for helping with my project.

19:50.835 --> 19:52.837
You shouldn't go wasting your money.

19:52.831 --> 19:56.369
I've got enough shit
in this place as it is.

20:05.297 --> 20:07.492
What was it like?

20:08.800 --> 20:09.949
Flying?

20:12.721 --> 20:14.643
I don't want to talk about it.

20:15.720 --> 20:20.066
PROPELLER AIRCRAFT AND GUNFIRE

20:20.065 --> 20:22.989
I read a lot of pilots found
it hard to cope after the war.

20:22.983 --> 20:25.190
They missed it so much.

20:32.078 --> 20:33.841
Reggie. Reggie.

20:33.831 --> 20:35.765
Yeah?

20:39.389 --> 20:44.941
You're the only person I know
who enjoys meals on wheels.

20:44.934 --> 20:46.970
Why do you get them delivered?

20:46.962 --> 20:49.396
Legs don't work.

20:49.393 --> 20:53.397
No-one to push me,
since I lost the wife.

20:53.398 --> 20:55.377
Why don't you ask for some help?

20:55.374 --> 20:57.103
I like to keep myself to myself.

20:58.827 --> 21:00.727
Like a bit of privacy.

21:08.439 --> 21:10.213
Two little ducks, 22.

21:12.076 --> 21:13.213
Kelly, love, Libby wants a word.

21:13.206 --> 21:14.594
It's about Liam.

21:14.586 --> 21:16.861
What's up?

21:16.854 --> 21:19.436
He's just really withdrawn.

21:19.433 --> 21:20.809
Plus, he's lost his appetite.

21:20.809 --> 21:23.482
I thought he might open up to you.

21:23.481 --> 21:26.996
Young and keen, number 15.

21:26.986 --> 21:29.022
How's he doing at school?
Has he made any friends?

21:29.012 --> 21:30.240
Not really.

21:30.237 --> 21:33.058
But he has befriended a retired
gentleman. Always round there.

21:33.050 --> 21:36.099
S and M. Number 10.

21:36.097 --> 21:36.688
What's wrong?

21:36.681 --> 21:40.458
Well...why would an old geezer
want to spend time

21:40.447 --> 21:41.550
with an 11-year-old boy?

21:43.051 --> 21:45.815
I'll have a word.

21:45.811 --> 21:47.779
Danny La Rue, 52.

21:47.771 --> 21:50.547
Where have they all come from?

21:50.544 --> 21:53.320
Autumn Days.
Nursing home on Brewer Lane.

21:53.314 --> 21:56.397
Sister-in-law works there. She's
give me the entertainment budget.

21:56.396 --> 22:00.878
They keep forgetting to cross
off the bloody numbers. Senile!

22:15.459 --> 22:17.245
Frank Gallagher!

22:33.261 --> 22:36.025
Sky, speed, adrenalin -

22:36.015 --> 22:39.678
the best thrill, the purest high,
of my entire life!

22:39.672 --> 22:41.765
Feel it. Feel it.

22:41.757 --> 22:43.475
Feel it, lad -

22:43.473 --> 22:45.509
that energy, that strength!

22:45.503 --> 22:47.789
That's how we lived.
That's how we got through it.

22:47.785 --> 22:50.276
Grasp every opportunity.

22:50.267 --> 22:53.577
Take it and squeeze every second out
of every minute, out of every hour,

22:53.575 --> 22:58.525
out of of every day,
knowing it could be your last.

22:59.522 --> 23:03.964
No!
every bullet that whistled through the
air every streak of fire

23:04.002 --> 23:07.002
that flew from the enemy guns,
could mean you'd be over, like that.

23:08.556 --> 23:10.346
Faces melted,

23:10.386 --> 23:12.297
blown apart, torn limb from limb.

23:12.297 --> 23:13.309
The screams, the pleas.

23:13.304 --> 23:16.523
"You would not tell
with such high zest

23:16.514 --> 23:19.449
"To children ardent
for some desperate glory

23:19.448 --> 23:23.680
"The old lie

23:23.679 --> 23:26.716
"Dulce et decorum est
Pro patria mori."

23:26.709 --> 23:29.598
My sister's just been sent
to Afghanistan.

23:32.123 --> 23:32.384
I'm sorry.

23:33.501 --> 23:35.287
But that's how it is.

23:50.159 --> 23:52.263
Nutter's flipped again.

23:56.463 --> 23:58.306
Karen. What the fuck?!

23:58.296 --> 24:01.345
What? There's a free Engie Benjy
in selected boxes.

24:01.336 --> 24:03.429
He's Connor's favourite.

24:17.328 --> 24:19.137
Not our lucky day, eh?

24:24.284 --> 24:25.444
Sorry about the mess.

24:33.912 --> 24:36.597
Hey, hey. How much did you get
for her? (CHUCKLES)

24:39.520 --> 24:40.373
You OK, kiddo?

24:42.186 --> 24:45.838
I, er...hear you've got
a new friend.

24:48.973 --> 24:51.077
Where'd you get the cash
for all that?

24:51.076 --> 24:53.010
Used my dinner money.

24:54.663 --> 24:55.937
You get free meals.

24:57.883 --> 24:59.680
How did the interview go?

24:59.672 --> 25:01.390
All right. OK.

25:01.390 --> 25:04.609
Good. I dunno.

25:04.602 --> 25:07.162
Well, they'd be stupid
not to take you on.

25:07.162 --> 25:09.904
What does a head cleaner do, anyway?
Get a bigger brush?

25:19.400 --> 25:21.436
You did the right thing. He needs
to stand on his own two feet.

25:21.428 --> 25:24.534
Chucking your own brother
out on the streets?!

25:24.527 --> 25:25.539
Homophobe!

25:29.859 --> 25:31.019
What can I get for you?

25:36.311 --> 25:38.324
Two pints. Vodka and coke.

25:38.323 --> 25:40.325
He said anything about me?

25:41.985 --> 25:44.442
Only that you made him very welcome.

25:44.432 --> 25:49.017
Considering he's a royalty-loving,
right-wing nonce,

25:49.016 --> 25:50.984
your dad's quite a laugh, in't he?

25:49.016 --> 25:50.984
You've met me dad?

25:50.982 --> 25:54.429
Met?! He was Sonny to my Cher.

25:54.422 --> 25:56.913
Portland Street Hotel. We're barred.

25:56.912 --> 25:59.415
It's nice to know
he's busy enjoying himself.

26:02.315 --> 26:04.237
I don't think he's coping very well.

26:04.231 --> 26:08.258
That's why he needed
some medicinal support.

26:08.250 --> 26:10.616
Listen. As much as we care
about our kids,

26:10.614 --> 26:12.696
we don't always
do the right thing by them.

26:13.842 --> 26:17.619
Even I have been neglectful
on occasion.

26:17.618 --> 26:19.893
He doesn't give a shit about me.

26:19.889 --> 26:21.800
He never has.

26:21.800 --> 26:23.836
You see, that's where you're wrong.

26:23.826 --> 26:27.296
You leaving home and living with us
was a kick in the teeth for him.

26:27.296 --> 26:28.285
He said so himself.

26:31.579 --> 26:34.855
Listen, you'll have to act straight
when you're serving.

26:34.850 --> 26:39.128
Oh, it's a good job I left my Lycra
hot pants at my dad's, then, innit?

26:39.118 --> 26:40.892
Punters aren't used to it.

26:40.887 --> 26:43.674
Don't usually get
arse-bandits round here.

26:43.671 --> 26:47.983
I'm not the only bloke here who gets
a stiffy watching the Rugby League.

26:54.613 --> 26:55.898
Hi, son.

27:04.407 --> 27:05.851
Excuse me.

27:11.406 --> 27:12.850
What the...?

27:16.271 --> 27:17.203
What?

27:18.665 --> 27:20.212
Your mother's left me up shit creek.

27:22.158 --> 27:23.682
When did you last eat?

27:23.682 --> 27:24.706
Can't remember.

27:25.836 --> 27:28.748
Right, get your arse in the bath.
Tea'll be ready when you come down.

27:29.923 --> 27:32.539
And chuck your dirty washing
down t'stairs.

27:37.073 --> 27:38.961
Did "time outs" tonight.

27:38.952 --> 27:41.978
Leaving a situation whenever
you start to feel uptight.

27:41.968 --> 27:44.846
Yeah, well, I think it's
a load of touchy-feely bollocks.

27:44.838 --> 27:47.238
Well, it's working.
As you've already seen.

27:49.683 --> 27:52.925
Can see why your Liam likes
going to that old boy's house.

27:52.923 --> 27:53.810
Spoiling him rotten.

27:53.801 --> 27:56.395
Bags of sweets and...

27:56.395 --> 27:58.659
Thought he'd be chuffed, but...

27:58.648 --> 28:01.196
Looked far from chuffed
when I just saw him.

28:04.698 --> 28:06.097
(FRANK) Vroom, vroom!

28:07.692 --> 28:10.047
Frank! What are you doing with that?

28:10.047 --> 28:11.935
(CHUCKLES) Found it in the yard.

28:14.698 --> 28:17.075
So why's that old bloke
been giving you sweets?

28:17.066 --> 28:17.953
Button it up, Jenson.
