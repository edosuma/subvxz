11:29.356 --> 11:31.581
suppressing his deeper urges.

11:31.674 --> 11:32.598
But...

11:32.693 --> 11:35.752
now that he's taken
his first life...

11:35.770 --> 11:37.845
he'll do it again.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.605
And soon.

11:40.367 --> 11:43.535
You can't keep a good man down.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.706
EDRISA:
How long

11:47.933 --> 11:50.099
do we stare at it
before we go crazy?

11:50.193 --> 11:52.293
Oh, I'm already crazy.

11:54.122 --> 11:55.939
You must really love it, though.

11:56.032 --> 11:57.549
To do it as a hobby.

12:00.111 --> 12:01.778
Growing up...

12:01.796 --> 12:05.598
my parents used to take me
on their research trips.

12:07.135 --> 12:10.453
I was six years old...

12:10.472 --> 12:13.047
when I accidentally
played with a voodoo doll.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.900
And, um, like, a year later,

12:16.052 --> 12:18.361
I saw my first cadaver.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.797
The two are unrelated.

12:20.890 --> 12:22.815
Mm... I think.

12:22.968 --> 12:24.225
The point is,

12:24.244 --> 12:25.985
that when it came
to making friends,

12:26.079 --> 12:27.895
I never really fit in.

12:27.989 --> 12:30.415
But then I found
the Killabustas.

12:30.642 --> 12:34.002
And, you know,
they're a bunch of misfits.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.672
But together, we're a family.

12:38.650 --> 12:40.333
JT:
Got an ID.

12:40.485 --> 12:41.834
Vic's name is

12:41.928 --> 12:43.911
Alex Malone.

12:44.005 --> 12:45.412
60-year-old retiree from Queens

12:45.432 --> 12:47.915
who's also a member
of the Audubon society.

12:47.934 --> 12:50.101
He fought for
the conservation of birds.

12:50.253 --> 12:51.844
Well, that can't
be a coincidence.

12:51.997 --> 12:53.513
It isn't.

12:54.666 --> 12:58.167
Um, Alex was a member
of the Killabustas.

12:58.261 --> 13:01.004
We called him Birdboy.

13:01.022 --> 13:03.239
He was my friend.

13:04.192 --> 13:05.617
Edrisa, I'm sorry.

13:05.768 --> 13:07.844
So...

13:07.862 --> 13:09.770
we were trying to track

13:09.790 --> 13:11.380
how The Vulture
might've acquired

13:11.382 --> 13:12.791
the birds in his videos.

13:12.942 --> 13:15.442
Alex was following
a lead on Craigslist.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.278
BRIGHT:
Well, maybe he found something.

13:17.297 --> 13:20.206
Alex got too close and
The Vulture flicked the switch.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.116
He killed to keep
his identity hidden.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.968
You and Dani check Alex's house.

13:24.195 --> 13:25.804
I'll talk to Gil, get a warrant.

13:25.955 --> 13:27.380
Good, got it.

13:27.474 --> 13:28.473
I'll go with them.

13:28.700 --> 13:29.974
No.
No, no, you won't.

13:30.126 --> 13:33.061
No, I-I won't.

13:40.211 --> 13:42.445
(engine shuts off)

13:43.990 --> 13:45.306
You coming?

13:45.325 --> 13:48.051
You know, I lost someone
in the field once.

13:48.069 --> 13:50.161
When I was undercover.

13:51.406 --> 13:53.998
Shouldn't we go
look for a crime scene or...

13:57.745 --> 13:58.837
I'm fine.

13:59.064 --> 14:00.563
I know I say that a lot.

14:00.582 --> 14:01.714
Her name was Kayla.

14:03.068 --> 14:05.844
I watched her OD and...

14:05.995 --> 14:07.345
I couldn't save her.

14:07.572 --> 14:10.740
Everyone told me that
I should take a break after,

14:10.758 --> 14:13.000
but I lied

14:13.094 --> 14:14.911
and told them that I was fine.

14:14.929 --> 14:16.688
Just like you always do.

14:17.765 --> 14:19.248
Cocaine helped.

14:19.267 --> 14:22.360
Not feeling, not... thinking.

14:22.511 --> 14:25.346
Until I OD'd.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.698
And...

14:26.849 --> 14:30.702
when everything went dark,
all I could think was...

14:31.779 --> 14:33.663
...I deserve this.

14:36.042 --> 14:37.950
I'm sorry.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.211
I don't want
your sympathy, Bright.

14:40.363 --> 14:41.938
I want you to listen to me.

14:41.956 --> 14:45.049
Trauma doesn't just disappear
because you want it to.

14:45.201 --> 14:47.276
You have to face it.

14:47.295 --> 14:49.762
But you don't have
to face it alone.

14:50.949 --> 14:52.039
(knocking)

14:52.133 --> 14:54.058
Hey! Sorry!

14:56.229 --> 14:57.637
Okay, I pulled a Bright.

14:57.789 --> 15:00.289
But I couldn't just, you know,
sit back and do nothing.

15:00.308 --> 15:01.757
The son of a bitch
killed my friend!

15:01.809 --> 15:04.652
It's fine, just don't make
"pulling a Bright" a habit.

15:08.800 --> 15:10.533
This looks like our crime scene.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.819
BRIGHT:
Whoever broke in

15:13.972 --> 15:14.913
used serious force.

15:15.064 --> 15:16.664
Maybe a chain saw.

15:19.402 --> 15:20.710
Stop! NYPD!

15:23.998 --> 15:26.165
Stop! Stop!

15:26.259 --> 15:28.242
-I said stop!
-Bright, get out of the road!

15:28.261 --> 15:32.430
It's a four-door hybrid,
fuel-efficient family car.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.675
-Bright!
-I said stop!

15:35.827 --> 15:38.010
(grunts)

15:38.163 --> 15:40.271
Bright!

15:41.608 --> 15:43.524
Oh! Aah!

15:45.019 --> 15:46.778
Hey, look.

15:46.929 --> 15:48.187
It worked.

15:48.339 --> 15:49.447
-(car door opens)
-WOMAN: Oh, God.

15:49.674 --> 15:50.782
Is he dead?

15:51.009 --> 15:52.842
I knew I shouldn't have been
the getaway driver!

15:52.860 --> 15:55.769
-I have night blindness!
-You had right of way.
He can't sue.

15:55.863 --> 15:57.180
Put your hands on the car!

15:57.198 --> 15:59.123
Whoa! Whoa!
I can help. I'm a fireman.

15:59.275 --> 16:01.442
DANI:
I said on the car.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.461
Wait, I know you.

16:03.612 --> 16:04.704
You're MrJuly.

16:04.856 --> 16:06.613
No, no, no,
they're-they're not suspects.

16:06.633 --> 16:10.593
These are my super close friends
from online.

16:11.362 --> 16:14.263
They're all Killabustas.

16:23.875 --> 16:25.984
MARTIN:
Well, that's quite a bump

16:26.211 --> 16:28.528
you got on your keppy.

16:29.897 --> 16:32.323
And I'm hallucinating.

16:34.736 --> 16:36.385
Not good.

16:36.404 --> 16:39.055
I'm talking to someone
who isn't here.

16:39.073 --> 16:42.000
That's psychosis, if I'm lucky.

16:42.227 --> 16:44.335
Schizophrenia if I'm not.

16:44.562 --> 16:47.288
Or it could be a four-door
hybrid running you down.

16:48.082 --> 16:49.899
Why won't you open up to Dani?

16:49.917 --> 16:51.917
Be honest with her.

16:52.070 --> 16:54.904
She's practically
begging for it.

16:54.922 --> 16:57.073
What?

16:57.166 --> 16:58.349
You're not okay.

16:58.501 --> 17:01.502
All this trauma
you're trying to push down.

17:01.596 --> 17:03.079
You know,
it's not gonna disappear

17:03.097 --> 17:04.713
as soon
as you solve another case.

17:05.767 --> 17:08.842
The only thing I need
to disappear is you.

17:08.862 --> 17:11.604
Look, I'm not your father.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.847
I'm just that part of your mind

17:13.867 --> 17:17.426
that you really, really, really
want to ignore.

17:17.487 --> 17:19.929
Talk to her.

17:20.022 --> 17:22.022
She's not like the others.

17:22.116 --> 17:24.024
You can trust her.

17:24.118 --> 17:26.360
You're not here.

17:26.379 --> 17:29.505
You're not here.
You're...

17:34.370 --> 17:36.596
...not here.

17:38.466 --> 17:40.725
So, you're MrJuly.

17:40.952 --> 17:42.876
The one who found
The Vulture's videos.

17:42.970 --> 17:46.564
I thought you didn't know
anyone else's real identity.

17:46.791 --> 17:47.957
Oh, I didn't.

17:48.050 --> 17:51.051
I mean, MrJuly's avatar
was a super-hot fireman.

17:51.071 --> 17:52.386
I figured it was a sock puppet.

17:52.405 --> 17:53.571
You know, like,

17:53.722 --> 17:56.240
a fake picture
that you put on your profile.

17:57.744 --> 17:58.984
But you're real.

17:59.079 --> 18:01.228
So are you.

18:01.247 --> 18:02.729
You can call me Blaze.

18:02.749 --> 18:03.897
Yes I can.

18:03.991 --> 18:04.990
(both chuckling)

18:05.085 --> 18:08.311
(clears throat)
Okay, Blaze.

18:08.329 --> 18:10.646
We still need to ask you
a few questions.

18:10.781 --> 18:12.573
Ashton, why were you at Alex's?

18:12.592 --> 18:15.484
Same as you. Trying to find out
what went down with Birdboy.

18:15.578 --> 18:17.244
Which is a little crazy,
but not...

18:17.263 --> 18:19.430
"jump in front of a car" crazy.

18:19.582 --> 18:21.841
Is that police procedure--
jumping in front of a car?

18:21.935 --> 18:23.434
No, no it isn't.

18:23.661 --> 18:25.344
<i> BLAZE:</i>
<i> I was worried about Birdboy.</i>

18:25.496 --> 18:27.588
He went radio silent
on the message board.

18:27.607 --> 18:30.775
So Blaze messaged the group that
he was going to Birdboy's house.

18:30.926 --> 18:35.004
But only LululeMom and DeadHead
were willing to meet in person.

18:35.022 --> 18:38.599
I can't believe he's dead.

18:38.618 --> 18:39.842
Murdered.

18:39.935 --> 18:42.036
By The Vulture.

18:45.032 --> 18:47.867
I, uh, like your jacket,
by the way.

18:48.019 --> 18:50.294
Oh.
It's pleather.

18:50.446 --> 18:51.671
Blaze.

18:51.798 --> 18:54.448
How did you know that
Alex was The Vulture's victim?

18:54.542 --> 18:56.783
<i> SASHA:</i>
<i> Alex reached out to Blaze</i>

18:56.878 --> 18:59.286
a few days ago.
He wanted to meet up.

18:59.305 --> 19:01.030
We thought he found
something on the killer.

19:01.048 --> 19:02.623
But Alex didn't show.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.308
So I started looking for him.

19:04.460 --> 19:07.478
Do you know there are 86
Alex Malones in New York City?

19:07.630 --> 19:10.890
But only one of them
is in the Audubon society.

19:10.984 --> 19:12.316
Sasha drove.

19:12.543 --> 19:13.893
We waited in the car
while Blaze went inside

19:13.987 --> 19:15.227
to make sure it was safe.

19:15.380 --> 19:17.213
I did a quick sweep,
but didn't find anything.

19:17.231 --> 19:19.048
I was about
to fill in the others

19:19.066 --> 19:20.825
when I ran into you.

19:21.052 --> 19:22.401
But, look, I-I get it.

19:22.495 --> 19:25.312
Breaking into the home
of a murder victim?

19:25.331 --> 19:26.555
I mean...

19:26.649 --> 19:28.574
it's a little suspicious.

19:28.726 --> 19:30.251
You think?

19:31.579 --> 19:34.079
Alex sent me a-a pamphlet

19:34.232 --> 19:35.748
from the Audubon society.

19:35.900 --> 19:39.326
I almost threw it out,
but I saw a note hidden inside.

19:39.345 --> 19:40.511
Oh, my God.

19:40.663 --> 19:42.180
I got a mailer
from the Audubon Society.

19:42.331 --> 19:43.497
-I tossed it.
-When?

19:43.516 --> 19:44.831
Yesterday.

19:44.967 --> 19:47.501
But I don't take my recycling
out until Thursday.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.745
-Let's go.
-Okay.

19:49.764 --> 19:51.247
Oh.

19:51.265 --> 19:54.417
You know, give me
a call sometime...

19:54.435 --> 19:57.987
if you want to fight
a real fire.

20:10.768 --> 20:13.377
-Gil. What are you...
-Bright

20:13.529 --> 20:16.530
said you needed your statement
from Martin's arrest.

20:16.549 --> 20:17.739
It wasn't easy.

20:17.741 --> 20:19.792
But I wrangled them
and everything else

20:19.944 --> 20:21.277
that wasn't bolted down
by the D.A.

20:21.295 --> 20:23.612
Remind me to take Malcolm
out of my will.

20:23.631 --> 20:25.781
He just wanted to help.

20:25.800 --> 20:27.391
So do I.

20:29.136 --> 20:30.469
Buyer's remorse?

20:30.621 --> 20:33.138
Uh, I have multiple remorses.

20:33.233 --> 20:35.608
I'm in way over my head.

20:37.128 --> 20:38.885
But thank you.

20:38.980 --> 20:40.721
Come on, Jess.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.889
You can do this.

20:42.984 --> 20:44.800
You have overcome enough

20:44.893 --> 20:46.244
for a dozen bestsellers.

20:46.471 --> 20:50.248
But everybody's already
made their mind up about me.

20:51.325 --> 20:53.501
I'm not gonna change anything.

20:55.663 --> 20:57.421
(exhales)

20:58.499 --> 21:01.575
You know, when you came in
for questioning...

21:01.669 --> 21:05.245
every cop in that precinct
thought you were guilty.

21:05.265 --> 21:07.765
That you knew about his crimes.

21:08.917 --> 21:10.101
But by the end,

21:10.252 --> 21:13.729
they all felt for you.

21:15.441 --> 21:17.441
Some still do.

21:19.020 --> 21:21.696
(both laugh)

21:23.508 --> 21:25.766
This memory lane

21:25.785 --> 21:27.693
you're heading down...

21:27.845 --> 21:29.770
I can help.

21:29.789 --> 21:32.698
I got myself
into this mess and...

21:32.850 --> 21:36.294
I need to get through it
on my own.

21:40.133 --> 21:43.359
(grunts)
So, welcome, come in, relax.

21:43.452 --> 21:45.636
I don't know, office area...
bedroom.

21:45.788 --> 21:48.306
It's... oh, not relevant,
it's just, you know,

21:48.457 --> 21:51.792
elephant in the room,
it's right-right-right there.

21:51.811 --> 21:53.035
Queen-size bed, pillow-top.

21:53.128 --> 21:54.795
-Recycling?
-Yeah, uh, the sink.

21:54.889 --> 21:56.221
(alarm chirping)

21:56.316 --> 21:58.316
Oh, that's my Killabusta alert.

22:00.378 --> 22:01.444
Mm...

22:03.064 --> 22:04.547
Oh, it's nothing new.

22:04.640 --> 22:06.715
It's just LululeMom
updating the group about Alex.

22:06.734 --> 22:09.234
(phone vibrating)

22:09.329 --> 22:12.054
Oh.
It's a text from Blaze.

22:12.073 --> 22:13.313
(laughs): Ah.

22:13.407 --> 22:15.074
He wants to go
on a date tonight.

22:15.226 --> 22:19.078
Do you think that he is
the romance from my horoscope?

22:19.230 --> 22:21.080
How tall do you think he is?

22:21.232 --> 22:22.340
I don't know.
Six feet?

22:22.567 --> 22:24.157
Really?
I thought he was six, three.

22:24.177 --> 22:26.177
It's... No? It's so hard
to tell from down here.

22:26.328 --> 22:27.678
Oh, look, there it is.

22:27.830 --> 22:30.389
Huh.
Yeah.

22:32.076 --> 22:33.184
From Alex.

22:33.335 --> 22:35.411
He knew you worked
with the NYPD?

22:35.429 --> 22:37.913
I let it slip that I was
a medical examiner.

22:38.006 --> 22:39.357
Well, good that you did.

22:39.584 --> 22:42.101
He found out that The Vulture
bought their birds online

22:42.195 --> 22:45.512
under the username
Save The Sparrows.

22:45.531 --> 22:47.106
Save The Sparrows?

22:47.258 --> 22:49.425
I know that username.
He's...

22:49.443 --> 22:51.260
He's a member
of the Killabustas.

22:51.278 --> 22:53.037
He infiltrated the group.

23:13.393 --> 23:15.041
(monitor beeping)

23:15.061 --> 23:17.210
(clears throat)
Uh, Dr. Capshaw.

23:17.230 --> 23:19.212
I'm sorry.
Um...

23:19.232 --> 23:21.732
Kameron's IV is leaking.

23:24.128 --> 23:25.653
Oh, thank you.

23:27.481 --> 23:28.797
I'll fix it.

23:28.816 --> 23:31.075
If you loosen my leash,
I could fix it for you.

23:31.226 --> 23:32.559
That won't be necessary.

23:32.578 --> 23:34.578
You can't keep
pushing me away, Vivian.

23:34.730 --> 23:37.665
Stop. Now.

23:38.567 --> 23:39.750
Just doing my job.

23:39.902 --> 23:43.662
Speaking of, I noticed
Kameron also has impetigo.

23:43.814 --> 23:46.999
An infection like that
can spread like bed bugs.

23:47.093 --> 23:49.001
I can handle my patients.

23:49.095 --> 23:50.410
So I shouldn't tell Mr. Benjamin

23:50.504 --> 23:53.246
he has a precancerous mole
behind his left ear?

23:53.266 --> 23:55.766
I'd get that checked out ASAP.

23:55.918 --> 23:57.226
That's enough.

23:58.012 --> 24:00.438
Not for me, Vivian.

24:00.665 --> 24:02.648
(laughs)

24:03.684 --> 24:04.733
(laughter)

24:08.263 --> 24:10.281
I thought we had
an understanding.

24:10.432 --> 24:12.841
Well, I thought you valued
my medical intellect.

24:12.893 --> 24:14.176
Or are you just upset

24:14.195 --> 24:15.936
because I noticed
the impetigo first?

24:16.030 --> 24:17.179
You're making a scene.

24:17.272 --> 24:19.039
I'm only getting started.

24:21.461 --> 24:23.109
Mr. Benjamin,

24:23.129 --> 24:26.112
Whitly's agitated
and aggressive.

24:26.132 --> 24:28.357
-Restrain him.
-MARTIN: No...

24:28.450 --> 24:30.426
-(Kameron laughing)
-(grunts)

24:38.644 --> 24:39.977
Anyone else?

24:42.373 --> 24:44.231
(grunts)

24:49.547 --> 24:52.156
-(laughter)
-I can't believe it.

24:52.307 --> 24:53.532
What?

24:55.328 --> 24:57.620
KamaSutures.

24:59.147 --> 25:02.625
Just feels like I just
went on a date with a celebrity.

25:04.061 --> 25:06.152
Who says it has to end?

25:06.247 --> 25:08.756
Not me.
Definitely not me.

25:19.093 --> 25:22.761
Oh, um, watch out.

25:22.855 --> 25:25.064
I bite.

25:39.205 --> 25:41.263
Any update on Save The Sparrows?

25:41.282 --> 25:42.873
He sent some threatening
messages to Alex,

25:43.100 --> 25:44.116
tech can't trace him

25:44.268 --> 25:46.410
and he's really good
at hiding online.

25:47.213 --> 25:49.288
Hmm.
He isn't really hiding.

25:49.382 --> 25:52.866
He's looking for a place
to belong.

25:52.885 --> 25:55.052
The Killabustas
are the only people

25:55.203 --> 25:57.446
who really know him.

25:57.464 --> 26:00.040
That's a seriously twisted mind.

26:00.059 --> 26:02.351
Sure.
The kind I get.

26:04.138 --> 26:07.122
The Vulture
spends his life alone.

26:07.141 --> 26:09.382
Ignored, isolated.

26:09.402 --> 26:12.052
He killed birds online
for attention.

26:12.146 --> 26:14.313
That's what Edrisa's group
gives him.

26:14.465 --> 26:16.556
But Alex was gonna
out him to the group.

26:16.576 --> 26:21.470
You're right. Killing Alex
wasn't about self-preservation.

26:21.563 --> 26:24.306
It was about
preserving the group.

26:24.325 --> 26:25.749
The Vulture needs them.

26:25.976 --> 26:29.044
None of this is getting us any
closer to finding the killer.

26:30.497 --> 26:32.314
What if we already have?

26:32.333 --> 26:35.408
Who found the videos
in the first place?

26:35.428 --> 26:38.262
Who was supposed to meet Alex
before he was murdered?

26:38.489 --> 26:40.598
Who organized the break-in
and invited

26:40.825 --> 26:43.342
the others to meet in real life?
One person.

26:43.494 --> 26:45.102
Blaze. He fits.
He works odd hours

26:45.329 --> 26:46.495
knows his way
around a chain saw.

26:46.588 --> 26:48.689
And he's on a date
with Edrisa right now.

26:54.855 --> 26:56.688
Oh, no.

26:56.841 --> 26:58.841
Blaze beat us here.

26:58.934 --> 27:00.008
Oh!

27:00.027 --> 27:02.511
Dani?
B-Bright?

27:02.604 --> 27:03.603
What are you doing here?

27:03.697 --> 27:05.289
Are you sure about this profile?

27:05.440 --> 27:07.499
I was.

27:09.778 --> 27:12.187
Wait, y-you think
I'm The Vulture?

27:12.280 --> 27:14.632
Uh, that was our working theory.

27:14.783 --> 27:16.467
But, uh...

27:17.619 --> 27:18.952
...our killer
would never order takeout.

27:18.971 --> 27:21.347
No, we didn't order takeout.

27:22.867 --> 27:24.558
BRIGHT:
Well, what's this, then?

27:30.724 --> 27:33.633
EDRISA:
What? What is it?

27:33.727 --> 27:35.694
We found our victim's head.

27:54.064 --> 27:56.298
♪ ♪

28:08.170 --> 28:10.062
We've met before.

28:11.857 --> 28:15.133
You spoke
at my medical school in '95.

28:15.194 --> 28:17.510
Dr. Martin Whitly,

28:17.530 --> 28:21.514
the great
cardiothoracic surgeon.

28:21.608 --> 28:23.759
I wanted what you had.

28:23.777 --> 28:28.330
The career, the respect.

28:29.099 --> 28:31.283
I was top of my class.

28:31.435 --> 28:32.935
(chuckles)

28:33.028 --> 28:34.770
You even congratulated me.

28:34.788 --> 28:39.133
But once I started residency,
it fell apart.

28:40.627 --> 28:45.389
I pushed myself to be the best,
the next great surgeon.

28:47.284 --> 28:49.309
I wasn't part of their club.

28:51.121 --> 28:53.063
Didn't play their games.

28:54.959 --> 28:58.652
They called me reckless.

28:59.554 --> 29:01.888
So, since you asked,

29:01.982 --> 29:04.742
that's how I landed here.

29:06.804 --> 29:08.746
Out in the cold.

29:12.993 --> 29:14.901
Surgeons can be real bastards.

29:14.995 --> 29:18.330
To break a child's rib cage
with your hands

29:18.482 --> 29:22.742
because you know that you can
undo what God has done.

29:22.762 --> 29:25.578
There's a reason they call them
"killer instincts."

29:25.598 --> 29:29.433
Yeah. I bet you say that
to all the girls.

29:29.584 --> 29:30.509
(both laugh)

29:30.603 --> 29:32.844
You know, listen,
I watched you drill

29:32.997 --> 29:34.513
into a man's head freestyle.

29:34.665 --> 29:38.108
Well, they were wrong
about you, Dr. Capshaw.

29:38.335 --> 29:40.110
And I'm sorry about, uh,

29:40.262 --> 29:42.170
undermining your authority.

29:42.264 --> 29:44.948
You should always
feel in control.

29:45.100 --> 29:48.768
Well, sometimes
it's fun to lose control.

29:48.862 --> 29:50.270
(laughs softly)

29:50.289 --> 29:53.181
No, no.
You, uh...

29:53.275 --> 29:55.292
You've got to forget
about me, Viv.

29:55.519 --> 29:56.868
What do you mean?

29:57.021 --> 29:58.295
You deserve someone

29:58.446 --> 30:02.257
who can help you make
your dreams come true.

30:04.136 --> 30:06.428
I'm only good at nightmares.

30:07.473 --> 30:10.307
You have no idea
what I dream about.

30:22.321 --> 30:23.737
(clicking)

30:26.400 --> 30:28.992
We're gonna have
to make this quick.

30:29.995 --> 30:31.995
Well, I can't make any promises.

30:42.842 --> 30:45.250
Hey, uh, thanks
for offering your place.

30:45.402 --> 30:47.386
I feel better
knowing she's safe.

30:48.663 --> 30:51.306
Can't believe The Vulture
knows where I live.

30:52.576 --> 30:54.743
(chuckles): Oh.

30:54.761 --> 30:56.436
This is nice.

30:57.764 --> 30:59.505
Gil's ready to shut down
the group until it's safe.

30:59.525 --> 31:01.375
The killer's obviously
targeting members.

31:01.377 --> 31:04.653
Not yet. We need to see
what they do next.

31:05.606 --> 31:06.605
(Edrisa exhales)

31:06.757 --> 31:09.107
I did not know
you were into bondage.

31:09.259 --> 31:11.660
You're, uh, into bondage?

31:12.687 --> 31:15.355
(scoffs)
Like, light bondage.

31:15.374 --> 31:17.332
(whispers):
And not so light.

31:20.120 --> 31:22.045
(tongue clicking)
Oh.

31:22.197 --> 31:25.457
This is a fridge
of a very sad person.

31:25.609 --> 31:27.442
We should order sushi.

31:27.461 --> 31:29.202
And I acknowledge the fact
that it is weird

31:29.296 --> 31:31.555
that I still want takeout.

31:32.616 --> 31:33.798
(knocking on door)

31:33.951 --> 31:35.634
Did you already order?

31:36.395 --> 31:40.713
Better.
I invited the Killabustas.

31:40.733 --> 31:42.048
Ones with alibis.

31:42.067 --> 31:43.383
Thank God you called.

31:43.402 --> 31:44.884
I was about to get crunk
on Chardonnay,

31:44.978 --> 31:46.144
but this is much
more productive.

31:46.238 --> 31:47.720
I've got a good update.

31:47.740 --> 31:49.907
A Killabusta in Thailand
was able to pull 50 hours

31:50.058 --> 31:51.557
of surveillance footage
from the warehouse.

31:51.652 --> 31:53.577
Do I want to know
how they did that?

31:54.471 --> 31:56.229
No.
You definitely do not.

31:56.248 --> 31:58.306
I'll set us up
on the big screen.

31:58.325 --> 32:00.626
Maybe we'll find something.

32:01.995 --> 32:04.146
What is happening?

32:04.164 --> 32:05.923
Oh, we are web-sleuthing.

32:06.074 --> 32:07.649
(chuckles)
Pretty cool, right?

32:08.502 --> 32:11.053
We're turning the case
over to them?

32:18.662 --> 32:20.845
ASHTON:
Okay, guys.
I've zoomed in on it.

32:20.940 --> 32:22.922
What is it?

32:23.016 --> 32:24.975
They clocked a van
parked outside the warehouse

32:25.127 --> 32:26.168
on the night of the murder.

32:26.261 --> 32:28.353
You think
they're onto something?

32:28.447 --> 32:29.354
We'll see.

32:29.448 --> 32:30.596
Look, it's got blinds,

32:30.691 --> 32:32.598
and they're closed,
so you can't see inside.

32:32.618 --> 32:35.953
And that-that is
an Arizona plate. Arizona!

32:36.104 --> 32:37.696
Why is that important?

32:37.848 --> 32:39.864
Because The Vulture got
all of his birds from Arizona.

32:39.959 --> 32:41.533
Great eye, Ashton.

32:41.685 --> 32:44.444
Oh, I'm just a truck driver.
But what do you think?

32:44.538 --> 32:46.779
What are the chances
that van's still there?

32:46.799 --> 32:48.614
-Yeah, let's check it out.
-Yeah,

32:48.634 --> 32:50.801
-Babysitter's got
another two hours.
-I think we'll just get snacks.

32:51.028 --> 32:52.302
Uh, I'm sorry, guys,

32:52.454 --> 32:54.304
but the NYPD
is gonna take over from here,

32:54.531 --> 32:56.122
just to be safe.

32:56.141 --> 32:58.383
Ugh. Buzzkill.
Fine.

32:58.477 --> 33:00.385
I'll go put my stupid kids
to bed.

33:00.537 --> 33:02.370
I need a ride to my rig.
Blaze?

33:02.464 --> 33:05.732
Oh, yeah, don't worry,
I can take you.

33:09.896 --> 33:11.488
Uh...

33:12.640 --> 33:14.049
It's not much, but...

33:14.067 --> 33:15.742
I want you to be safe.

33:25.337 --> 33:27.671
I'll see you around,
KamaSutures.

33:33.828 --> 33:35.345
(door closes)

33:36.164 --> 33:37.088
EDRISA:
Exciting, right?

33:37.241 --> 33:39.090
I mean, the van-- that's a clue.

33:39.243 --> 33:40.909
That's a real clue.

33:40.927 --> 33:42.185
I'm not sure.

33:42.337 --> 33:44.079
What, are you jealous?

33:44.172 --> 33:45.747
I'm sorry Blaze is so jacked.

33:45.766 --> 33:47.340
That's not it.

33:47.434 --> 33:48.750
Um, the cruiser did a drive-by.

33:48.752 --> 33:51.177
The van is still there,
with Arizona plates.

33:51.196 --> 33:52.529
-Of course it is.
-(phone vibrating)

33:53.273 --> 33:55.590
Gil, what did you find?

33:55.609 --> 33:57.259
Plates aren't registered
to a van, they were stolen

33:57.277 --> 33:59.110
from a truck depot
outside Phoenix.

33:59.263 --> 34:00.454
DANI:
Truck depot.

34:01.281 --> 34:03.498
Run a background on Ashton.

34:04.768 --> 34:06.434
Wait, what does this have
to do with Ashton?

34:06.453 --> 34:08.937
We didn't find the clue,
we were shown it.

34:08.955 --> 34:12.774
50 hours of grainy black-
and-white surveillance footage,

34:12.793 --> 34:14.125
and after barely an hour

34:14.278 --> 34:16.444
he finds an out-of-focus
license plate.

34:16.538 --> 34:18.871

34:18.998 --> 34:20.615
of the plates on Ashton's cab.

34:20.634 --> 34:23.009
Looks like he's been
through Arizona

34:23.062 --> 34:24.469
six times in the last year.

34:24.621 --> 34:26.471
EDRISA:
No, no, no, he-he said
all of his routes

34:26.565 --> 34:28.290
were in the northeast.

34:28.308 --> 34:30.975
-Why would he lie?
-Because Ashton is The Vulture.

34:31.128 --> 34:32.977
Oh, my God.

34:33.130 --> 34:34.887
-He's with Blaze.

<i> Bright, Ashton's van</i>

34:48.903 --> 34:51.046
That's not good.

34:59.581 --> 35:03.341
<i>-It's locked, and there's blood.</i>
-That's not good either.

35:04.161 --> 35:07.062
Call it in. I got to go.
Edrisa!

35:11.926 --> 35:13.610
Hey.

35:13.761 --> 35:15.737
What's up, guys?

35:17.007 --> 35:17.948
Ashton.

35:18.099 --> 35:21.343
Great.
Uh, we got a new lead.

35:21.361 --> 35:22.268
You should come back up
to the loft.

35:22.362 --> 35:24.955
I think you guys can help.

35:25.182 --> 35:26.456
Sure. Yeah.

35:26.608 --> 35:28.941
Uh, Edrisa, could you give me
a hand with this stuff?

35:28.961 --> 35:31.128
BRIGHT:
Where's Blaze?

35:31.964 --> 35:33.797
Oh, he's pulling the car around.

35:33.948 --> 35:36.299
Great.
I'll call him.

35:36.526 --> 35:38.552
(line ringing)

35:41.531 --> 35:44.432
I'm sorry, Edrisa.

35:45.552 --> 35:47.702
He's not gonna answer.

35:47.721 --> 35:50.372
-(line beeping)
-He's bleeding out in my truck.

35:50.465 --> 35:52.374
Thought I'd pick up
some cleaning supplies

35:52.467 --> 35:54.800
-before I take him apart.
-EDRISA: How can you be

35:54.895 --> 35:56.153
The Vulture?

35:56.304 --> 35:58.396
I thought we were friends.

35:58.548 --> 36:00.306
We are friends.

36:00.325 --> 36:03.735
Everything I've done
has been for us.

36:03.887 --> 36:04.903
For the group.

36:04.997 --> 36:06.312
I've been a freak my whole life.

36:06.406 --> 36:09.148
I had no one
until that bird video.

36:09.168 --> 36:11.059
Suddenly I was a part
of something.

36:11.077 --> 36:12.894
But Alex found out who you were,

36:12.913 --> 36:14.820
so you killed him.

36:15.507 --> 36:18.416
-He was gonna ruin everything.
-EDRISA: Ashton,

36:18.568 --> 36:20.068
please, you can't let Blaze die.

36:20.161 --> 36:21.252
He's one of us.

36:21.405 --> 36:24.072
No.
This is how this has to be.

36:24.090 --> 36:26.332
Blaze will die, I will escape,

36:26.351 --> 36:28.351
and then you
will keep looking for me.

36:28.578 --> 36:32.314
-This is our family.
-Ashton, it won't work.

36:33.174 --> 36:35.099
Family will only go so far.

36:35.252 --> 36:37.510
'Cause once
they know the truth--

36:37.604 --> 36:40.846
who they're really after--

36:40.866 --> 36:43.241
they'll give up on you.

36:45.704 --> 36:47.537
And no...

36:47.689 --> 36:49.021
more...

36:49.041 --> 36:50.490
family.

36:51.359 --> 36:54.461
No.
She'll never let me go.

36:56.882 --> 36:58.698
BRIGHT:
You're right.

36:58.717 --> 37:00.508
She won't.

37:01.294 --> 37:03.303
Aah!

37:05.707 --> 37:08.040
(groaning)

37:08.060 --> 37:09.709
I'll call a bus.

37:09.728 --> 37:11.561

He's alive!

37:27.746 --> 37:31.248
-Hey.
-Oh, Blaze.

37:31.416 --> 37:34.993
Look at you.
I thought you were dead.

37:35.145 --> 37:37.479
But you're gonna be fine.

37:37.497 --> 37:38.997
Very, very fine.

37:39.149 --> 37:40.331
It was Ashton.

37:40.425 --> 37:42.333
I know.

37:42.427 --> 37:43.334

37:43.428 --> 37:44.577
I mean, I got him.
