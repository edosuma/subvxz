00:15.140 --> 00:19.476
This is parkour.
lnternet sensation of 2004,

00:19.686 --> 00:22.146
and it was in one
of the Bond films.
lt's pretty impressive.

00:22.230 --> 00:25.774
The goal is to get
from point A to point B
as creatively as possible.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.568
So technically
they are doing parkour,

00:27.652 --> 00:31.113
as long as point A is delusion
and point B is the hospital.

(lNAUDlBLE)

02:20.056 --> 02:22.391
Ever since MichaeI's
Monica Lewinsky incident.

02:22.559 --> 02:23.892
He didn't do
anything sexual.

02:24.102 --> 02:26.937
He just made far,
far too many Monica
Lewinsky jokes.

02:27.730 --> 02:30.315
lt was just easier for
corporate to shut down
the program.

02:33.278 --> 02:35.404
Think she did him?
l bet there's
something there.

02:35.530 --> 02:36.989
l was with them in
the kitchen yesterday,

02:37.073 --> 02:39.199
and they were all too happy
to be cleaning the freezer.

02:39.325 --> 02:41.660
lf they get married
before l do, l'm going
to kill myself.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.912

Nobody.

lf somebody doesn't tell me,
l'm gonna start screaming.

lt's Eric and Megan.

Hey, l hired them.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.881
This place is like
Spaniard fly.

02:53.965 --> 02:56.091
They're not getting married.
lt's just talk.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.759
Did everybody know
about this but me?

02:57.844 --> 02:59.803
There's nothing to know.
lt's just gossip.

03:02.098 --> 03:03.307
Okay. Okay.

03:04.434 --> 03:06.018
We haven't told anyone
that l'm pregnant.

03:06.102 --> 03:09.354
What with her being unmarried,
knocked up by some guy.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.857
The yakety-yaks in this office
would have a field day.

03:11.941 --> 03:13.692
Yeah, and we don't
want them at the
wedding thinking

03:13.776 --> 03:16.778
Jim's being marched
down the aisle by my
dad with a shotgun.

03:18.114 --> 03:19.364
Wait, there's not going
to be a shotgun?

03:19.449 --> 03:20.490
Nope.

03:20.575 --> 03:23.243
No shotgun? Because
that changes everything.

03:23.453 --> 03:24.786
Can't back out
now, Halpert.

03:25.580 --> 03:28.624
What are you going
to do about it?
There's no shotgun, so,

03:30.084 --> 03:32.211
free at last,
free at last.

03:33.421 --> 03:34.504
No, keep it up.

03:36.132 --> 03:37.132
You'll never guess
what l know.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.134
Okay. Let me finish
this thought.

03:39.636 --> 03:41.094
Eric likes Megan.

03:42.347 --> 03:43.639
He most definitely does.

03:43.806 --> 03:45.766
He's been asking her out
repeatedly for weeks.

03:45.850 --> 03:48.769
She finally said yes.
They went out on a group
date the other night.

03:48.853 --> 03:50.229
Apparently
it went very well.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.232
How do you know this?
People tell me things.

03:53.316 --> 03:55.234
l guess l have
a face you can trust.

03:55.318 --> 03:57.319
l think it's because
of my low cheek bones.

03:58.196 --> 04:01.907
And boom. Okay, what is it?
What can't l guess?

04:02.951 --> 04:05.577
l hate, hate, hate
being left out.

04:05.870 --> 04:10.374
Whether it's not being
picked for a team or
being picked for a team

04:10.458 --> 04:13.627
and then showing up
and realizing that
the team doesn't exist,

04:14.629 --> 04:16.546
or that the sport
doesn't exist.

04:17.382 --> 04:19.383
l should have known.

04:20.677 --> 04:23.553
Oh, man, l know
how you feel.
Third wheel.

04:23.638 --> 04:26.848
l have been the third wheel
so many times in my life.

04:27.517 --> 04:29.643
My mom told me something
once that made me
feel a lot better.

04:29.727 --> 04:33.855
She said, "The third wheel
is what makes it a tricycle."

04:34.148 --> 04:35.190
What are you
talking about?

04:35.275 --> 04:37.526
l am talking about
your group date
with Megan and Eric.

04:37.652 --> 04:38.860
At Tinks?
Yes.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.320
How'd you know
about that?
Well. . .

04:40.405 --> 04:41.655
Did Stanley tell you?

04:42.365 --> 04:44.741
Stanley was on your
group date?

04:45.034 --> 04:46.868
No. Stanley
was with his wife.

04:46.953 --> 04:48.537
l waved at him
but he didn't wave back.

04:50.039 --> 04:51.039
(CHUCKLES)

04:51.124 --> 04:52.582
Does anybody else
know about this?

No.

Anybody hear anything?

05:06.222 --> 05:08.974
Nothing? l got a little
something-something.

05:09.559 --> 05:10.892
l don't know
if l should say.

05:11.102 --> 05:12.311
So just keep it
to yourself, then.

05:12.395 --> 05:14.563
Stanley is having
a midlife crisis.

05:14.647 --> 05:16.815
Stanley is way past
the middle of his life,

05:16.899 --> 05:18.650
especially considering
his height-to-weight ratio.

05:18.735 --> 05:21.278
Well, apparently,
he and his wife

05:21.362 --> 05:23.989
were out dancing
at a club
for young people.

05:24.073 --> 05:25.657

05:27.994 --> 05:30.829
She's at an interior
decorating expo in Philly.

05:31.039 --> 05:35.792
And Stanley hates crowds,
kids and music. l think you
should check your facts.

05:43.092 --> 05:46.428
You stupid son of a bitch.
You set me up.

05:46.596 --> 05:47.554
What are you
talking about?

05:47.638 --> 05:49.264
Stanley's wife
is out of town.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.349
He was with somebody.

05:50.433 --> 05:51.475
He was definitely
with someone.

05:51.601 --> 05:54.102
Oh ! Was he?
Well, who?
His sister?

05:55.438 --> 05:56.605
l don't get it!

05:57.106 --> 05:59.900
lf that was his sister,
then what they were doing
was totally illegal.

06:01.110 --> 06:02.110
Drugs?

06:03.488 --> 06:04.696
Making out.

06:10.453 --> 06:11.787
Okay.

06:16.459 --> 06:17.959
Okay.
No, it's okay.

right now, thrilled perhaps,
to be a part of the office,

06:28.638 --> 06:30.305
to be a part of
the conversation.

06:30.390 --> 06:34.017
When you have somebody's
attention, and their eyes
are lighting up

06:34.102 --> 06:36.853
because they are
very interested in
what you have to say,

06:36.938 --> 06:38.063
that is a great feeling.

06:38.147 --> 06:40.524
And I experienced that
firsthand today.

lt is wonderful to be
the center of attention.

06:51.661 --> 06:54.121
He could be doing
a crossword puzzle
with that pencil.

What's that letter,
right there? Same
letter here and here.

06:57.959 --> 06:59.668
What haven't you guessed?
T.

T! Yes! Yes!
That is a T.

there. Just sound that out.

stop telling people.

07:36.205 --> 07:39.833
Okay. l get it. You feel
out of the loop and you
feel sorry for yourself,

07:39.917 --> 07:42.085

sad because everybody
thinks you're a loser.

they saw you at the club,

and they all said
it was you.

it was a stupid idea. . .

lt's so stupid.
. . .to go up in that club.

traveling a lot lately.

Cynthia's been
keeping me company.

08:38.601 --> 08:42.145
She was my nurse
when l was
in rehabilitation.

08:42.313 --> 08:45.774
We used to go
on these long walks
on the treadmill.

08:47.902 --> 08:49.319
l didn't intend. . .

08:49.403 --> 08:51.738
Wait, wait, wait.

So it is true?

Yeah, but Michael,
l'm going to go
break it off.

08:56.035 --> 08:57.202
That's where l'm headed
right now. l swear.

08:57.286 --> 08:59.037
Oh, my God.
Wait a second.

08:59.121 --> 09:03.250
Do people often say
they're going on sales calls
and then go someplace else?

09:03.334 --> 09:04.376
Because that's not cool.

09:04.460 --> 09:09.130
l just need you to promise
not to say a word
about this to anyone.

09:09.590 --> 09:10.549
Michael, please.

09:10.633 --> 09:12.425
l'm not saying
a damn thing.

09:12.510 --> 09:13.885

on you, Michael.

Oh, that smells good.

lt just depends
on how many l eat.

Did you hear about Angela?
That's pretty weird.

09:26.857 --> 09:30.318
Yeah. What do you
mean exactly?

09:30.611 --> 09:35.490
Well, the fact that
she apparently is dating
an 81 -year-old billionaire.

How do you
un-tell something?
You can't.

09:46.168 --> 09:48.336
You can't put words
back in your mouth.

09:48.421 --> 09:53.133
What you can do is
spread false gossip,

09:53.676 --> 09:56.845
so that people think
that everything that's
been said is untrue,

09:57.096 --> 09:59.514
including "Stanley
is having an affair."

10:01.225 --> 10:04.936
lt's like the end of
Spartacus. l've seen that
movie half a dozen times,

10:05.313 --> 10:07.731
and l still don't know
who the real Spartacus is.

10:08.065 --> 10:11.818
And that is what makes that
movie a classic whodunit.

We should do something.

10:20.161 --> 10:21.286
Nothing can be done.

10:21.370 --> 10:24.372
Just have to tell
everybody and hope
for the best, l guess.

Yeah. So. . .

Mmm-hmm.

Did you hear
Pam is pregnant?

10:41.515 --> 10:42.849
(WHlSPERlNG) Really?
Yeah.

10:53.361 --> 10:54.944

Tea.

10:56.030 --> 10:57.739

You would.

10:58.240 --> 11:01.576
l like tea.
Oh, l bet you like it.

11:01.661 --> 11:06.456
Yeah. l like it a lot.
l love tea.

as you like men's butts?

11:09.794 --> 11:12.754
What?
Because you're gay.

11:14.757 --> 11:20.095
Who told you that?
Was it Broccoli Rob?
Someone from Chi Psi?

11:20.596 --> 11:22.263
Or did you run
into someone from
my high school?

This is not the first
time rumors about me
being gay have come up.

11:27.103 --> 11:28.353
Twice before, actually.

11:29.689 --> 11:34.234
Just a weird coincidence.
lt's a little too weird.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.320
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

11:37.613 --> 11:40.532

if it's not a coincidence
at all. Whoa!

11:41.492 --> 11:42.909
Which it is, of course.

11:44.620 --> 11:46.162
But it makes you wonder.

11:47.123 --> 11:50.458
Did you hear the rumor
about me, that l'm gay?

11:50.710 --> 11:52.585
l did, yes.

11:53.295 --> 11:55.296

What?

Do you think that l'm gay?

to other men?

(SCOFFlNG)

12:05.641 --> 12:06.683
No.

12:07.977 --> 12:09.936
But let me kick
you a scenario.

12:10.146 --> 12:14.441
l'm at, like, a beach cabana
and Brad Pitt approaches,

12:14.650 --> 12:16.192
tries to lean in
and kiss me.

12:18.362 --> 12:24.159
l would definitely resist,
like, at first,
but if he was persistent,

12:24.994 --> 12:29.664
l might give in a little bit
to just sort of see
what it felt like.

12:30.124 --> 12:35.795
Would l push him away?
How hard? Like, what if he's,
like, really aggressive?

12:35.963 --> 12:41.885
lf you resisted Brad Pitt
a little bit, he would
still need to get to you?

12:41.969 --> 12:46.139
This is not real Brad Pitt,
this is, like, in my. . .
This is my fantasy.

12:46.348 --> 12:50.226
Or it's, like, not fantasy,
it's, like, what l'm. . .
lt's just a scenario.

12:50.686 --> 12:56.858
Well, l wish l could help you.

OSCAR: What exactIy
is my responsibility here?

fall to me.

A few months.
That's why they're
rushing the wedding.

(SOFTLY) Guys, guys,
guys, you can't believe
everything you hear.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.793
Like Stanley
having an affair.

13:14.877 --> 13:17.879
That is crazy.
There's no stock in it.

13:18.255 --> 13:21.090
lt's a weird day
for false facts.
Just let it go.

13:21.634 --> 13:27.180
Okay, everybody, big day.
Last day for our interns.
Lot of other stuff.

13:27.556 --> 13:31.601

Dwight, the honors.

13:33.020 --> 13:38.066
Present these to the Dean

l've attached my card.

13:38.150 --> 13:40.193
Call me any time
of the day or night.

13:40.569 --> 13:41.820
Why would we call
you at night?

13:42.780 --> 13:45.323
Well, now you can't call me
at all, so problem solved.

13:45.449 --> 13:46.950
You're going to regret that
when you find yourself

13:47.034 --> 13:49.077
between a moose
and her cubs at night.

13:49.370 --> 13:52.330
Look to the intern

Now to your right.

One of you will do
exceedingly well in business,
just unlimited potential.

13:56.961 --> 13:59.921
One of you
will make a living
and nothing more.

14:00.339 --> 14:03.967
And one of you
will make
a great mother.

14:05.469 --> 14:08.638
lt's up to you to choose
which you want to be.

14:10.808 --> 14:12.559
l am so happy
you're eating again.

14:12.643 --> 14:13.893
Me, too.

14:14.103 --> 14:16.437
Tuna, how come you never
try to set me up?

14:16.730 --> 14:19.774
l don't really do that.
But Pam might have
some friends, though.

14:20.025 --> 14:21.526
Women friends?
Yeah.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.111
Not guy friends?

14:23.445 --> 14:25.697
Are you interested
in her guy friends?

14:25.781 --> 14:28.449
No. l mean,
for the record,
l prefer women.

14:28.576 --> 14:31.703
Okay.
But off the record,
l'm kind of confused.

14:31.954 --> 14:32.996
Really?

14:33.122 --> 14:36.207
Yeah, the evidence
is sort of stacked
against me, l feel like.

14:36.333 --> 14:38.501
Well, you've got to
figure this out.
Yeah, right?

14:38.586 --> 14:39.752
Yeah.
How?

14:39.837 --> 14:41.588
You've got to have
sex with a woman.

14:41.672 --> 14:42.714
Righto.

14:42.798 --> 14:44.716
And then a man.
And then compare.

14:44.800 --> 14:45.800
Oh !

14:48.095 --> 14:49.095
All right.

Yep.

conceived out of wedlock
is still a bastard.

What?

15:07.072 --> 15:08.156
Want me to say it again?

15:08.240 --> 15:09.782
Why did that come
into your brain?

Can l talk to you
for a second?

15:13.162 --> 15:14.579
So, they know.

Who did you tell?
l didn't tell anyone.
Who did you tell?

Nobody.

15:18.292 --> 15:22.128
Hey, did one of you tell
Stanley that l have asthma?
Because l don't.

15:22.212 --> 15:24.464
lf it gets out they
won't let me scuba.

15:24.548 --> 15:28.051
lf l can't scuba,
then what's this
all been about?

15:28.135 --> 15:29.510
What am l working toward?

15:29.637 --> 15:33.139
What? You think
l'm the voice
of the Taco Bell dog?

15:33.891 --> 15:37.894
What are you guys talking
about? l have a daughter.
How could l be a virgin?

15:38.187 --> 15:41.272
Hey, has everyone heard
a crazy rumor about
themselves today?

15:41.357 --> 15:42.482

Yeah, yeah ! You know what,
let's discredit these rumors.

15:45.194 --> 15:47.320
Yeah, sure, but who's been
saying all that stuff?

15:47.404 --> 15:50.573
lt's not important, Jim.
l just think we shouldn't
listen to any of this crap.

15:50.658 --> 15:52.450
Sure, but we should
get to the bottom of this.

and trace it back
to the beginning.

15:54.662 --> 15:56.371
l need to do
mine first.

15:56.747 --> 16:00.249
Who's been saying
that there's another
person inside of me

16:00.542 --> 16:02.585
working me
with controls?

16:02.795 --> 16:05.088

16:05.339 --> 16:06.631
l heard it from Erin.

16:06.715 --> 16:07.757
KEVlN: What?

16:07.841 --> 16:09.509
l heard it from Michael.

16:10.344 --> 16:11.344

16:13.263 --> 16:14.263

16:15.474 --> 16:16.641

Nowhere.

my manure comes from.

16:49.133 --> 16:50.508
Even the fact
that l'm gay?

16:50.592 --> 16:52.260
Yes.
Yes!

16:52.511 --> 16:55.596
But, guys,
l'm a victim here,
too. Okay?

16:55.681 --> 16:57.849
People have been saying
that l'm a J.Crew model.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.851
No, we heard
that about Jim.

16:59.935 --> 17:04.022
Jim? No, no, l spread
the rumor that somebody
here was a J.Crew model

17:04.106 --> 17:05.440
and l was referring
to myself.

17:05.607 --> 17:06.733
How is that
a bad rumor?

17:06.817 --> 17:10.737
Because a lot of people think
that models, even though
they're very attractive,

17:10.821 --> 17:14.323
are somewhat vapid.
lt's set our industry
back quite a bit.

17:14.450 --> 17:18.453
Michael, why? Why say all
these things? Why make up
an eating disorder,

17:18.662 --> 17:21.205
Stanley's affair,
me being a spokesdog?

17:21.290 --> 17:23.207
You told everyone
l was having an affair?

17:23.292 --> 17:25.043
Okay, okay,
here's the thing.

17:26.128 --> 17:30.840
There was one true rumor
out there today. l didn't want
everybody to know what it was,

17:30.966 --> 17:34.218
so all of you
are off the hook except
for this one person.

17:34.595 --> 17:36.554
Well, then what's
the one true rumor?

17:36.638 --> 17:37.972
We have a right to know.

17:38.182 --> 17:40.933
Michael, am l gay?

17:41.810 --> 17:46.272
The one true rumor,
and this is going to ruin
this person's life, is that. . .

17:46.356 --> 17:47.356
That Pam's pregnant.

17:47.524 --> 17:49.692
ANGELA: l knew it, l knew it.
l knew it!

17:49.902 --> 17:53.613
Her breasts were
a tiny bit bigger.
At first, l thought,

17:53.822 --> 17:56.115
"Oh ! She has a new
bra with padding."

17:56.200 --> 17:59.994
But then l thought,
"Pam doesn't need padding."

18:00.329 --> 18:01.829

add up, Jim.

fall on the sword this way.

Yes.

to defend us,

was inconclusive.
