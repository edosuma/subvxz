00:00.360 --> 00:01.360
Previously
on Roswell, New Mexico...

00:01.360 --> 00:03.560
SANDERS:
I've seen that thing before.

00:03.560 --> 00:05.800
It is definitely explosive.

00:05.800 --> 00:07.840
It can be killed.
I got to get back to my lab.

00:07.840 --> 00:09.400
MICHAEL:
They're shooting the fireworks
into the wind.

00:09.400 --> 00:11.400
MAX:
All it's gonna take is
one tiny spark, and this

00:11.400 --> 00:14.040
whole place is gonna blow.
You don't know what he is, son.

00:14.040 --> 00:15.080
I know what he means to Alex.

00:15.080 --> 00:16.080
(both screaming)

00:16.080 --> 00:17.120
No.

00:17.120 --> 00:18.440
Max!

00:18.440 --> 00:20.000
Hey, hey.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.480
Liz, what happened?!
Let me take over.

00:21.480 --> 00:22.680
I can't lose him again.

00:22.680 --> 00:24.680
You are the only one
who can save an entire

00:24.680 --> 00:26.440
carnival of people
from a bomb!

00:26.440 --> 00:27.880
(panting)

00:29.720 --> 00:31.920
(crowd screaming, clamoring)

00:34.840 --> 00:36.360
Isobel!

00:36.360 --> 00:39.840
Liz... I'm trying to keep
the fire away from it, but...

00:39.840 --> 00:41.280
I think there might be too much!

00:42.600 --> 00:44.880
I have to activate
the ingredients first, but

00:44.880 --> 00:47.080
once I introduce
my solution to this system,

00:47.080 --> 00:49.000
it should kill
the cellular matrix.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.080
And-and deactivate the bomb?

00:51.080 --> 00:52.240
Yes.

00:53.480 --> 00:54.920
(strains)

00:56.320 --> 00:57.320
Aah!

00:57.320 --> 00:58.400
It's hot.

00:58.400 --> 01:00.320
I have less time than I thought.

01:00.320 --> 01:02.800
(panting):
Oh, God.

01:02.800 --> 01:04.800
Please, I'll do anything.

01:04.800 --> 01:07.120
I'll... I'll be better.

01:07.120 --> 01:08.800
Please...
(gasps)

01:08.800 --> 01:09.800
Oh, God.

01:09.800 --> 01:12.520
(coughing)

01:12.520 --> 01:14.320
Rosa, what happened?

01:14.320 --> 01:15.720
Check on Flint-- is he alive?

01:15.720 --> 01:17.280
(grunting)

01:17.280 --> 01:19.680
What did you do to him?

01:23.320 --> 01:26.680
Rosa, help me get Flint
to the hospital.
Okay.

01:28.680 --> 01:30.920
(coughing)

01:32.680 --> 01:34.120
What are you doing here?

01:34.120 --> 01:36.040
I told you, you
are free to go!

01:36.040 --> 01:39.200
Jesse Manes was the only one
who was supposed to get hurt.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.680
(coughing)

01:41.680 --> 01:43.040
Okay, okay,
keep her conscious.

01:43.040 --> 01:44.800
We're almost there--
down the hall.
Stay with us.

01:44.800 --> 01:47.120
It's okay, you're gonna be okay.

01:47.120 --> 01:48.480
Let's get an IV on her.
Hang in there.

01:48.480 --> 01:49.680
(clamoring)

01:52.280 --> 01:54.240
Is that supposed
to happen?

01:55.280 --> 01:57.000
Get as many families

01:57.000 --> 02:00.640
out of here as you can
and then run, Isobel, go!

02:00.640 --> 02:02.720
There is no reason for both
of us to die-- go!

02:02.720 --> 02:04.440
No!

02:04.440 --> 02:05.480
I can't leave you.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.800
Gregory, listen.

02:10.800 --> 02:12.480
You and I have had our
differences in the past,

02:12.480 --> 02:14.440
but you should
stand with me now.

02:14.440 --> 02:16.200
You're not well, Dad.

02:17.280 --> 02:18.400
MAN:
Move, move!

02:23.640 --> 02:26.000
ALEX:
Guerin, get the atomizer!

02:26.000 --> 02:27.800
Get it away from my brother!

02:27.800 --> 02:29.200
MICHAEL:
Alex, I can't.

02:31.600 --> 02:33.480
At least you came prepared.

02:33.480 --> 02:35.000
(winces)

02:38.440 --> 02:40.000
(Isobel straining)

02:49.040 --> 02:50.200
Liz,
get back!

02:53.080 --> 02:54.040
(gasps)

02:59.880 --> 03:00.920
MATT:
Liz!

03:00.920 --> 03:03.440
Isobel! Liz!

03:03.440 --> 03:06.440
(groans)
You disabled it, you...

03:06.440 --> 03:08.480
you saved everyone.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.000
I-Is Flint dead?

03:10.000 --> 03:12.280
Did you kill him?

03:14.680 --> 03:15.880
Drop it, Guerin.

03:17.040 --> 03:19.280
Drop it!
(gunshot)

03:19.280 --> 03:21.040
(crowd screaming)

03:25.320 --> 03:26.320
Greg.

03:26.320 --> 03:28.720
(choking)

03:30.480 --> 03:33.640
I should have defended you
from him a long time ago.

03:39.640 --> 03:43.000
There are no more
Manes men left.

04:02.480 --> 04:04.120
JAVIER:
You're late, Liz-- order up!

04:04.120 --> 04:05.480
Oh, sorry, Javi, I just
haven't really been sleeping.

04:05.480 --> 04:07.000
You've said that every day
since CrashCon.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.200
Still having nightmares?

04:08.200 --> 04:10.000
I'm fine.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.680
Did you read the papers
this morning?

04:11.680 --> 04:14.880
Oh, I've, uh, kind of been
trying to avoid the papers.

04:14.880 --> 04:17.320
Did you hear about that veteran
who died at the carnival?

04:17.320 --> 04:20.440
They're going to have
a parade, build a statue.

04:20.440 --> 04:22.120
Did you know
he was disabled?

04:22.120 --> 04:24.480
Here, seats two and three.

04:24.480 --> 04:26.840
I did know that, yeah.

04:26.840 --> 04:28.440
The CrashCon discourse is saying

04:28.440 --> 04:30.440
aliens invaded
and killed the guy.

04:30.440 --> 04:32.360
That should be
good for tourism.

04:32.360 --> 04:34.280
Newspaper said it was
smoke inhalation, though.

04:34.280 --> 04:35.600
He was making sure all
the kids got out safely

04:35.600 --> 04:37.040
and the smoke
overwhelmed him.

04:37.040 --> 04:39.360
WOMAN: We need
more people like him.

04:39.360 --> 04:41.800
(gasps)

04:41.800 --> 04:45.200
(groans) Uh, yeah, so table six
has been waiting forever.

04:45.200 --> 04:47.520
Okay, thank you.

04:49.600 --> 04:51.640
Oh, my God.

04:51.640 --> 04:53.480
Oh, God.

04:53.480 --> 04:55.800
Hi, your specials are
Steak Me to Your Leader

04:55.800 --> 04:57.680
and UnidentiFried Chicken.

04:57.680 --> 05:00.440
What do you recommend?

05:00.440 --> 05:02.080
I thought you went
back to Denver.

05:02.080 --> 05:04.000
I did go back,
I just really missed

05:04.000 --> 05:06.080
the Space Junk-Loaded
Cheese Fries.

05:06.080 --> 05:08.200
Uh, Elizabeth Ortecho,

05:08.200 --> 05:10.320
I'd like you to meet Doctor...
Margot Meyerson.

05:10.320 --> 05:12.000
I've-I've read all your studies.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.080
I'm assuming you're not here
for the Space Junk.

05:17.880 --> 05:19.800
What you doing?

05:19.800 --> 05:22.440
Oh, they cut your bracelet
off during surgery.

05:22.440 --> 05:24.120
How are you?

05:24.120 --> 05:25.640
You look better.

05:25.640 --> 05:29.440
Liz has been stopping
by every day to inject me

05:29.440 --> 05:31.120
with witch serum.

05:31.120 --> 05:32.880
Ooh, the synthetic
nucleotide

05:32.880 --> 05:34.520
excision repair
genomogenate?

05:34.520 --> 05:36.640
Mm-hmm.
We're lucky.

05:36.640 --> 05:38.320
You're only part alien,
otherwise there wouldn't

05:38.320 --> 05:40.080
have been enough left
of you for her to save.

05:40.080 --> 05:41.280
(exhales):
Yeah.

05:41.280 --> 05:43.120
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

05:43.120 --> 05:44.440
Listen.

05:44.440 --> 05:46.680
Do you think you could...

05:46.680 --> 05:49.240
use your telekinesis
to open this box?

05:50.600 --> 05:52.320
Mimi left it when she visited.

05:52.320 --> 05:55.520
It's a family heirloom,
but she forgot the key.

05:55.520 --> 05:57.360
Mimi hasn't exactly
been leading you

05:57.360 --> 05:59.080
in the right
direction lately.

05:59.080 --> 06:01.400
Her psychic visions led you

06:01.400 --> 06:03.360
toward a bomb instead
of away from it.

06:03.360 --> 06:05.280
Seeing you like
that-- all sick

06:05.280 --> 06:08.240
and pale and quiet--
I-I started praying.

06:15.480 --> 06:17.320
(sighs)

06:17.320 --> 06:21.000
So, uh, I got to get to work,
Iz, maybe we can...

06:21.000 --> 06:23.320
I wish I understood why Louise
and Nora would spent a year

06:23.320 --> 06:26.600
building an alien weapon
of mass destruction.

06:26.600 --> 06:28.640
I don't think
it was a bomb.

06:28.640 --> 06:30.600
I... think it's a
communication device.

06:30.600 --> 06:32.120
It's like a remote,
you know, it just

06:32.120 --> 06:34.440
happens to be combustible.

06:34.440 --> 06:35.800
Are you mad at me, Max?

06:35.800 --> 06:37.360
Did I do
something wrong?

06:37.360 --> 06:38.560
Is it that we're not related,

06:38.560 --> 06:40.040
or are you upset
about the abortion? Because I...

06:40.040 --> 06:41.800
Whoa, whoa, uh,
Iz, whoa, God, no.

06:41.800 --> 06:42.800
Because you're not talking
to me!

06:42.800 --> 06:44.880
You're not... the only one.

06:44.880 --> 06:47.480
I didn't want
everyone to worry,

06:47.480 --> 06:49.440
you know, 'cause I, uh...

06:49.440 --> 06:52.080
I've been taking...

06:52.080 --> 06:53.680
some of Liz's antidote.

06:53.680 --> 06:56.200
And things are
coming back to me.

06:56.200 --> 07:00.080
Little flashes, sort of, mostly.

07:00.080 --> 07:01.800
Michael said that you kind of

07:01.800 --> 07:05.720
zoned out when you touched
that alien bomb... remote thing.

07:05.720 --> 07:07.720
Did it trigger a memory?

07:07.720 --> 07:09.440
When I touched the
console, I heard

07:09.440 --> 07:12.880
whispers that I could
almost understand.

07:12.880 --> 07:15.080
All right, it's like
the same with those symbols.

07:15.080 --> 07:18.000
I mean, it's like their meaning
is, is just beyond reach.

07:19.040 --> 07:20.840
Except for one word. I, uh...

07:20.840 --> 07:22.920
I took this from Graham Green's

07:22.920 --> 07:25.360
display at CrashCon.
See that?

07:25.360 --> 07:26.720
It's an aerial photo
of some crop circles,

07:26.720 --> 07:28.320
from Roswell in 1948.

07:28.320 --> 07:30.120
This farm belonged to a guy

07:30.120 --> 07:31.280
called Jones.

07:31.280 --> 07:32.720
Pretty sure it says "savior."

07:32.720 --> 07:35.040
I don't understand.

07:35.040 --> 07:36.600
This is my name.

07:36.600 --> 07:37.800
Maybe that means that
you and Michael's parents

07:37.800 --> 07:39.440
weren't the only ones
that survived the crash.

07:39.440 --> 07:41.280
Right, maybe I had
a family, too.

07:41.280 --> 07:43.480
You know, maybe, maybe my
mom was just across town.

07:43.480 --> 07:45.200
Max.

07:45.200 --> 07:47.040
Max...

07:47.040 --> 07:49.040
I really wish
that you could...

07:49.040 --> 07:51.280
just focus
on the present.

07:51.280 --> 07:54.080
You know, I mean,
as a recently deceased man,

07:54.080 --> 07:55.840
I really feel like
you should be enjoying

07:55.840 --> 07:57.400
the simple pleasures
in life,

07:57.400 --> 07:59.880
you know,
like reading nerdy books,

07:59.880 --> 08:01.680
the smell of leather, and...

08:03.600 --> 08:06.280
...that feeling when you wake up
before your alarm

08:06.280 --> 08:09.440
and... the person you love is

08:09.440 --> 08:12.280
still asleep and they're
kind of snoring a little bit.

08:14.320 --> 08:16.320
It's like the best thing
that's ever happened to you.

08:19.440 --> 08:20.680
Stuff like that.

08:23.520 --> 08:25.880
I want all those things, too.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.120
But I feel
like if I only

08:28.120 --> 08:31.880
know half of myself,
I'm only half living.

08:31.880 --> 08:35.040
And I know you
understand that, Iz,

08:35.040 --> 08:38.360
because I've watched
you this year

08:38.360 --> 08:41.240
become your entire self.

08:43.320 --> 08:45.320
And it is so
beautiful.

08:45.320 --> 08:47.120
Okay, I am... am not
at all mad at you.

08:47.120 --> 08:48.440
Are you kidding me?

08:48.440 --> 08:49.480
I am so proud of you.

08:49.480 --> 08:51.200
I am... I am so proud

08:51.200 --> 08:53.120
that you're my sister.

08:53.120 --> 08:54.280
(sniffles)

08:54.280 --> 08:56.240
Oh, Max.

08:59.480 --> 09:00.720
(knocking)

09:03.720 --> 09:05.720
Hey.
Hey.

09:05.720 --> 09:08.920
Maria made me bring food over.

09:08.920 --> 09:11.440
Gave it to Gregory.

09:13.600 --> 09:15.600
He seems to be holding up okay.

09:17.720 --> 09:21.120
Everything my family
touches turns to crap.

09:21.120 --> 09:22.720
My dad used
to talk about

09:22.720 --> 09:24.680
how my Grandpa Harlan
built this shed

09:24.680 --> 09:26.120
with his bare hands
when he was, like,

09:26.120 --> 09:28.040
seventy.

09:28.040 --> 09:31.480
For a long time it
was my safest space.

09:32.520 --> 09:34.440
And then one night...

09:35.760 --> 09:37.680
...my dad destroyed it.

09:43.920 --> 09:45.920
You're right.

09:51.480 --> 09:53.320
(sighs)

09:54.480 --> 09:55.680
This place sucks.

10:02.200 --> 10:03.840
(both shouting)

10:10.920 --> 10:13.280
I don't understand
the violence, Max.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.760
Flint could have
had brain damage,

10:14.760 --> 10:17.080
given how long he
wasn't breathing.

10:17.080 --> 10:19.400
You risked your life to hurt
him, and-and he had already

10:19.400 --> 10:22.520
thrown the weapon
away, Max, so why?

10:22.520 --> 10:24.440
I can't get that
image out of my head,

10:24.440 --> 10:26.680
of you trying to
kill Alex's brother.
I know.

10:26.680 --> 10:28.240
I snapped.

10:28.240 --> 10:30.400
Last year, Noah told me
that we were energized

10:30.400 --> 10:33.680
by killing and not by healing.

10:33.680 --> 10:36.520
Even then, I knew
he was right. I...

10:36.520 --> 10:39.520
Obviously I can usually fight
that, but I guess this time

10:39.520 --> 10:41.600
my better angels
just didn't show up.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.680
We have to stop keeping
secrets from each other, Max.

10:44.680 --> 10:46.440
There's a scientist in town.

10:46.440 --> 10:47.880
She's a supervisor at Genoryx.

10:47.880 --> 10:50.400
She has a job for me
in California.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.400
She's offered to sponsor
my dad's citizenship.

10:52.400 --> 10:54.880
And it could put me in
a position to help Rosa, too.

10:54.880 --> 10:56.280
I mean, I'd be able
to do a lot of good

10:56.280 --> 10:57.720
with the grant money
they're offering,

10:57.720 --> 10:59.760
and I know that all sounds
too good to be true, but...

10:59.760 --> 11:02.840
It sounds like someone
finally realizes

11:02.840 --> 11:05.800
how valuable your mind is.

11:07.720 --> 11:10.800
I think that a change of scenery
will be so good for us.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.880
I mean,
we could get a place

11:12.880 --> 11:14.440
by the beach
and-and you can write.

11:14.440 --> 11:17.480
Uh, you want me to,
to come with you?

11:17.480 --> 11:19.840
Of course I do.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.280
Well, I mean, I...
(sniffles)

11:21.280 --> 11:23.440
I just told you I have
this killer instinct,

11:23.440 --> 11:25.720
and you want me to come
to California with you.

11:25.720 --> 11:27.040
We'll figure it out.

11:27.040 --> 11:28.840
Okay? We'll figure
all of it out,

11:28.840 --> 11:30.400

This is Tripp.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
My grandfather killed Tripp.

12:43.160 --> 12:44.440
Hey.

12:44.440 --> 12:46.080
Evans.

12:46.080 --> 12:48.240
Did you get arrested again?

12:48.240 --> 12:50.080
Ah, you found out about that.

12:50.080 --> 12:51.920
Yeah.

12:51.920 --> 12:53.800
(laughs)

12:53.800 --> 12:55.400
Okay.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.240
Thank you for that, Cam.
Thank you very much.

12:57.240 --> 12:58.840
You, uh,

12:58.840 --> 13:00.520
you hear from Charlie?

13:00.520 --> 13:02.600
Yeah.

13:02.600 --> 13:05.880
She texted me from a burner
phone that she was all right,

13:05.880 --> 13:08.720
and then she vanished again.

13:08.720 --> 13:10.600
So, um,

13:10.600 --> 13:13.080
I was gonna go eat my feelings
about it at the diner,

13:13.080 --> 13:15.000
if you want to join.
Oof. I would,

13:15.000 --> 13:17.800
but I have
a doctor's appointment,

13:17.800 --> 13:20.240
'cause that's a thing I do now.
Mm.

13:20.240 --> 13:24.080
Listen, um, I was wondering
if you would be interested

13:24.080 --> 13:25.840
in a little undercover work?

13:27.200 --> 13:29.120
MICHAEL:
So, Alex thinks Harlan found out

13:29.120 --> 13:33.280
Tripp was an alien sympathizer
all that time and he offed him.

13:33.280 --> 13:36.080
So Mimi must have known
that you would find it.

13:36.080 --> 13:38.240
That's why she left the box.

13:38.240 --> 13:41.240
Look, I know that you don't
trust my mom's visions,

13:41.240 --> 13:43.280
but I was the only one
that could grab that atomizer

13:43.280 --> 13:44.480
and run with it.

13:44.480 --> 13:47.480
If it had been you,
you'd be dead.

13:50.280 --> 13:52.320
What are you doing?

13:52.320 --> 13:54.000
Maria, that prevents
brain damage.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.400
I'm only part alien,

13:55.400 --> 13:56.920
but it is a part of me.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.160
Even if it's dangerous,

13:58.160 --> 14:00.240
I can't just turn off
a piece of myself.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.520
So I'm supposed
to sit around, helpless,

14:02.520 --> 14:04.200
as you fade away?

14:04.200 --> 14:07.440
Maria, I cannot watch you
disappear. I love you.

14:10.280 --> 14:12.040
(quietly):
I love you, too.

14:16.800 --> 14:18.800
So can we just let this go?

14:20.440 --> 14:22.320
You have it wrong.

14:22.320 --> 14:25.720
Mimi hasn't disappeared.
Yes, she can be inconvenient,

14:25.720 --> 14:27.280
she can make people
uncomfortable, but maybe

14:27.280 --> 14:30.200
she's supposed to be
an uncomfortable inconvenience

14:30.200 --> 14:32.000
that saves lives.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.600
And now,

14:33.600 --> 14:36.240
I need to be inconvenient,

14:36.240 --> 14:39.520
and I don't want to be
someone that hurts you.

14:42.200 --> 14:45.680
I think that we should
find out what's next,

14:45.680 --> 14:48.920
apart from each other.
Wait, so you think that if...

14:48.920 --> 14:52.800
if we break up, I'm gonna be
able to stop caring about you?

14:52.800 --> 14:56.680
I learned so much,
being with you.

14:56.680 --> 14:58.280
You sacrificed yourself

14:58.280 --> 15:00.840
without hesitation
when Alex needed you.

15:02.720 --> 15:04.520
I would have done
the same for you.

15:06.880 --> 15:08.880
I know.

15:08.880 --> 15:10.640
I don't doubt
your capacity for love,

15:10.640 --> 15:12.280
'cause you made me so happy
this year.

15:12.280 --> 15:14.520
(laughs)
And I loved

15:14.520 --> 15:17.600
being someone
that made you happy.

15:17.600 --> 15:21.600
I just think that we should
leave it be,

15:21.600 --> 15:23.720
before I wonder if someone else
could make you happier.

15:23.720 --> 15:25.040
(sniffles)

15:27.480 --> 15:29.320
Open the box, Guerin.

15:33.120 --> 15:35.160
Let's see what comes next.

15:40.080 --> 15:43.920
MICHAEL:
Tripp gave this to Maria's
grandmother Patricia.

15:46.920 --> 15:49.880
"Dear Patricia.
My name is Eugene Manes.

15:49.880 --> 15:52.160
If you're reading this,
I'm dead."

15:52.160 --> 15:54.520
His story starts the
night of the UFO crash.

15:57.440 --> 15:58.920
(gasps)

15:58.920 --> 16:00.640
TRIPP:
I couldn't hurt her.

16:00.640 --> 16:03.040
She was from another galaxy,
and yet...

16:05.240 --> 16:09.000
...somehow, she was as familiar
as my own reflection.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.680
It took a few weeks
to find her,

16:11.680 --> 16:13.720
but I was drawn back
to the Long Farm.

16:13.720 --> 16:17.080
Wait. Don't be afraid.
I'm not here to hurt you.

16:19.480 --> 16:22.000
You must know that.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.640
The same way I know
you aren't here to hurt me.

16:30.680 --> 16:33.240
It's warmer, closer to the fire.

16:39.120 --> 16:42.800
TRIPP:
It was as if we were built
from the same star...

16:42.800 --> 16:45.120
"...drawn together
by something cosmic."

16:48.200 --> 16:50.080
Hmm.

16:51.120 --> 16:53.280
What do you think will happen?

16:53.280 --> 16:55.120
What do you mean?
(laughs softly)

16:55.120 --> 16:57.200
When I die, idiot.

16:57.200 --> 16:59.160
(laughs softly)
You know,

16:59.160 --> 17:02.120
Socrates thought that death
was a blessing,

17:02.120 --> 17:04.120
because only one
of two things could happen.

17:04.120 --> 17:06.280
Either consciousness ceases,

17:06.280 --> 17:08.280
and it's like falling
into a dreamless sleep.

17:08.280 --> 17:12.400
Or, you go to where all who have
died before you have gone.

17:13.680 --> 17:16.080
Your loved ones,

17:16.080 --> 17:18.080
people you admire.

17:20.400 --> 17:23.720
If you lived a good
and just life,

17:23.720 --> 17:27.280
you will be surrounded
by goodness and justice,

17:27.280 --> 17:29.320
in a place
without fear.

17:35.800 --> 17:38.320
(grunts softly)
Sorry.

17:38.320 --> 17:40.600
I thought a lot about this
when my dad passed, so I-I...

17:40.600 --> 17:42.880
I'm sorry.

17:44.880 --> 17:47.160
I'm so sorry that I'm putting
you through this again.

17:47.160 --> 17:49.520
No.

17:49.520 --> 17:51.680
No, no, no.

17:51.680 --> 17:53.680
I want to be here.

18:01.520 --> 18:03.080
Sorry. It can wait.

18:03.080 --> 18:05.280
Max said you guys
had an appointment.

18:05.280 --> 18:07.080
It's okay.

18:07.080 --> 18:08.520
KYLE:
Don't flirt with
other doctors

18:08.520 --> 18:09.800
while I'm gone.

18:09.800 --> 18:11.680
(Steph laughs softly)

18:18.720 --> 18:21.920
I was very impressed with her
work when we first pursued her,

18:21.920 --> 18:24.880
but when I met her today,
not so much.

18:24.880 --> 18:27.160
Why? 'Cause she had a little
ketchup on her uniform?

18:27.160 --> 18:28.280
(gasps)

18:28.280 --> 18:30.280
Oh, my God.

18:30.280 --> 18:32.720
(slurring):
You're, like, so pretty.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.520
Like, I just think
that women

18:34.520 --> 18:39.160

they're beautiful, you know?

Okay.

18:46.320 --> 18:47.680
I am so sorry.

18:47.680 --> 18:50.200
Anyway, I think we
should move on.

18:50.200 --> 18:51.600
DIEGO (over device):
Okay, wait a second.

18:51.600 --> 18:53.640
Liz has been working
on something recently,

18:53.640 --> 18:55.640
but she signed this NDA.

18:57.920 --> 19:00.480
Although, I-I guess
she can't be blamed

19:00.480 --> 19:02.240
if we took a peek,

19:02.240 --> 19:03.400
you know,

19:03.400 --> 19:04.640

19:04.640 --> 19:06.200
MARGOT:
Okay.

19:10.080 --> 19:13.520
You know what I'm saying here,
right, Max?

19:14.840 --> 19:16.400
(phone vibrating)

19:17.680 --> 19:19.920
Oh-- I-I got to take this.

19:19.920 --> 19:21.920
CAMERON: You were right.
It is too good to be true.

19:21.920 --> 19:24.920
Diego just told some woman he
can get her access to Liz's lab.

19:24.920 --> 19:27.280
He must have followed her there.
Well, there's a security system.

19:27.280 --> 19:28.840
The way he's talking,
it sounded like

19:28.840 --> 19:31.640
Diego's pretty certain
he can get access.

19:31.640 --> 19:33.400
They just left here, Evans.
You need to tell Liz

19:33.400 --> 19:36.640
to get anything incriminating
out of there now.

19:44.040 --> 19:45.640
So, did he make
a move or what?

19:45.640 --> 19:47.680
Come on, Michael.
Read it out loud.

19:47.680 --> 19:50.000

23:04.680 --> 23:06.160
You look like me.

23:06.160 --> 23:08.520
Can whatever this is
wait till tomorrow?
ISOBEL: Nope.

23:08.520 --> 23:10.320
We spent the day reading
Tripp Manes' journal.

23:10.320 --> 23:11.520
Caffeinate, Max.

23:11.520 --> 23:13.040
Screw caffeine.

23:13.040 --> 23:15.680
You earned it.
Yeah, I know I earned it--
it's mine.

23:15.680 --> 23:17.240
Okay, so...

23:17.240 --> 23:20.080
when I asked Sanders
about this photo of Nora,

23:20.080 --> 23:22.120
he said he didn't know
whose hand this was.

23:22.120 --> 23:25.600
He was all, "Mr. Bernhardt,
Mr. Jones, Old Man Gibbons.

23:25.600 --> 23:27.120
Could've been
anybody."

23:27.120 --> 23:30.520
Jones? That's the guy who grew
the crop circles in the shape

23:30.520 --> 23:31.920
of my name.
Ten points to Hufflepuff.

23:31.920 --> 23:34.040
MICHAEL:
So, in October '48,
Nora decided

23:34.040 --> 23:37.040
not to finish building the ship
with Louise.

23:37.040 --> 23:39.120
She decided to go
to the reservation with Tripp.

23:39.120 --> 23:40.640
But then little Walt

23:40.640 --> 23:42.480
convinced her to go to
the fall festival, where,

23:42.480 --> 23:44.560
after successfully avoiding him
for a year,

23:44.560 --> 23:46.320
she finally ran into
the alien stowaway

23:46.320 --> 23:48.080
who had crashed the ship--
he'd been masquerading

23:48.080 --> 23:49.320
as a farmer.

23:49.320 --> 23:50.320
Mr. Jones.

23:50.320 --> 23:51.880
Tripp saw Jones approach Nora,

23:51.880 --> 23:53.600
and he recognized him
from the night of the crash,

23:53.600 --> 23:55.600
but he didn't have a chance
to ask Nora about it

23:55.600 --> 23:57.680
before Harlan called
for a raid on the farm.

23:57.680 --> 23:59.040
Yeah. And after
the massacre,

23:59.040 --> 24:01.120
Jones was
never heard from again.

24:01.120 --> 24:04.120
Crop circles...
were all that was left.
If you were in hiding,

24:04.120 --> 24:06.400
why would you grow corn
in the shape of an alien symbol?

24:06.400 --> 24:07.480
Maybe they
just grew that way.

24:07.480 --> 24:08.640
It's the same way that

24:08.640 --> 24:10.280
this symbol
just shows up everywhere,

24:10.280 --> 24:12.480
you know?
Wait,

24:12.480 --> 24:14.440
when did...?

24:16.680 --> 24:18.480
Oh, I got it when,
uh, we weren't sure

24:18.480 --> 24:19.600
if you were coming back.

24:22.320 --> 24:25.480
It didn't feel like it was ever
gonna be the same again.

24:26.880 --> 24:29.080
(softly):
All right.

24:29.080 --> 24:32.320
There. Now, can we all
cowboy up and focus, please?

24:32.320 --> 24:33.840
Let's feel our feelings

24:33.840 --> 24:36.320
after we've solved the mystery
of the unknown alien.

24:36.320 --> 24:37.760
After the raid

24:37.760 --> 24:40.520
on the farm, Nora was held
by Project Shepherd.

24:41.560 --> 24:43.200
Don't let Harlan
find you here.

24:43.200 --> 24:45.080
He'll make you
prove you hate me.

24:45.080 --> 24:46.520
Can you use your abilities

24:46.520 --> 24:48.640
to unlock this?
They've been putting
needles in me.

24:48.640 --> 24:52.240
Is Louise all right?
And the baby?

24:52.240 --> 24:53.560
There's still a heartbeat.

24:54.520 --> 24:56.000
But Louise won't speak
to anyone.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
She goes into her mind,

24:58.000 --> 24:59.480
where things
are beautiful,

24:59.480 --> 25:00.600
where there's no pain.

25:02.640 --> 25:03.760
Where we're all together.

25:03.760 --> 25:06.200
I'll get you out of here,
I swear.
No.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.200
You have to obey them.
Tripp,

25:08.200 --> 25:11.240
if your brother kills you and
Louise is lost in her mind,

25:11.240 --> 25:13.640
there will be no one
to protect my son,

25:13.640 --> 25:15.640
her daughter and...
(sniffles)

25:15.640 --> 25:17.000
the other.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.920
Without me
to wake them,

25:18.920 --> 25:20.840
they won't emerge for 50 years.

25:20.840 --> 25:23.400
June 14, 1997.

25:23.400 --> 25:25.000
It'll be safer then.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.200
What?

25:26.200 --> 25:28.080
No, I-I'll be long gone.

25:28.080 --> 25:30.200
Perhaps you'll have a son.

25:30.200 --> 25:31.640
Someone you can trust

25:31.640 --> 25:32.680
with a secret.

25:32.680 --> 25:34.080
Nora...

25:35.520 --> 25:38.200
I don't want
a family without you.

25:39.240 --> 25:42.200
You have to know that by now.

25:49.320 --> 25:51.240
(footsteps, laughter nearby)

26:11.640 --> 26:12.840
Liz, who would do this?

26:19.680 --> 26:21.440
(indistinct radio chatter)

26:24.640 --> 26:27.520
CHARLIE:
You never could
sit still, Jenna.

26:29.640 --> 26:31.480
You're here.
I was picking up

26:31.480 --> 26:33.000
another fake I.D.,

26:33.000 --> 26:34.840
a new name, and I...

26:34.840 --> 26:36.640
just couldn't do it.

26:36.640 --> 26:38.560
I fought so hard

26:38.560 --> 26:40.600
to become who I am,
and I just trade her in

26:40.600 --> 26:42.080
every time I get scared?

26:42.080 --> 26:44.080
No.

26:44.080 --> 26:46.120
I don't want to be
on the run anymore.

26:46.120 --> 26:48.200
I just...
Just be my sister.

26:49.880 --> 26:51.640
I'll keep you safe,
Charlie. Just stay.

26:54.080 --> 26:56.480
(crying quietly)

26:59.440 --> 27:01.800
What ever happened to that thing
that she and Louise

27:01.800 --> 27:03.320
were building
out in the dessert?

27:03.320 --> 27:05.720
I mean, did she ever tell him
where it was

27:05.720 --> 27:07.080
or what it was?
Nope.

27:07.080 --> 27:09.680
And when Tripp asked Louise
about it,

27:09.680 --> 27:11.200
she was silent.

27:16.400 --> 27:18.280
Why'd you do it, Max?

27:21.040 --> 27:24.320
I'd been asking you for weeks
to clear out that lab, okay?
I knew it wasn't safe.

27:24.320 --> 27:26.880
Alex installed a military-grade
security system.

27:26.880 --> 27:28.400
A system designed
by Genoryx, okay?

27:28.400 --> 27:29.800
Diego could
have hacked it.

27:29.800 --> 27:30.960
He could already
know everything.

27:30.960 --> 27:32.640
And his nefarious plan
is to what,

27:32.640 --> 27:35.680
set us up with a condo in L.A.,
give my family a second chance?

27:35.680 --> 27:37.320
Okay, I have a family
to protect, too.

27:37.320 --> 27:39.080
Yes, and you
could have stopped Diego

27:39.080 --> 27:41.800
without destroying a year
of my work!

27:41.800 --> 27:43.120
I had to act fast!

27:43.120 --> 27:45.240
So your first instinct was to go
with the one method

27:45.240 --> 27:46.920
that would break my heart?
Oh, I'm sorry,

27:46.920 --> 27:48.920
I wasn't thinking about
your heart when I'm staring

27:48.920 --> 27:50.120
No.
at jars with
Noah's liver

27:50.120 --> 27:51.800
and his brain.
I mean, what else

27:51.800 --> 27:53.400
did you harvest from us, Liz?

27:53.400 --> 27:54.920
Those are just cells.

27:54.920 --> 27:56.440
(sighs)

27:56.440 --> 27:58.920
I-I wasn't hurting anyone.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.040
I don't know what you thought
love was gonna be like

28:06.040 --> 28:07.720
when we were 17,

28:07.720 --> 28:09.440
but it isn't
just sunsets

28:09.440 --> 28:11.120
and horseback rides.

28:11.120 --> 28:12.280
You can't put this all on me.

28:12.280 --> 28:13.320
Okay? You were
sneaking around

28:13.320 --> 28:14.920
behind my back...

28:14.920 --> 28:15.920
I apologized.

28:17.480 --> 28:18.680
I stopped.

28:19.920 --> 28:22.080
Max, you died this year.

28:22.080 --> 28:24.080
I was all alone

28:24.080 --> 28:26.120
because of a choice you made,
but still,

28:26.120 --> 28:28.720
every single thing I did
was for you

28:28.720 --> 28:30.600
and about you

28:30.600 --> 28:32.000
and-and-and with you.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.920
So when you were back,

28:33.920 --> 28:36.640
when I could finally
touch you...

28:38.240 --> 28:41.400
...when I
could finally breathe...

28:41.400 --> 28:43.280
I needed to take just one moment

28:43.280 --> 28:46.040
to remember where I end
and where you begin.

28:46.040 --> 28:49.120
To just be whole
in who I am.

28:49.120 --> 28:51.120
I am a scientist.

28:52.440 --> 28:54.240
I am...
I am fighting for something

28:54.240 --> 28:55.720
that is bigger than me.

28:55.720 --> 28:58.000
I am trying to leave this world
a better place.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.200
And I am in love

29:00.200 --> 29:02.080
with you.

29:02.080 --> 29:04.400
And right now, I hate it.

29:10.120 --> 29:12.880
(door opens in distance)

29:12.880 --> 29:14.400
(door closes)

29:27.040 --> 29:28.440
(inhales sharply)

29:44.720 --> 29:47.880
ROSA:
So, Dad's checking your oil

29:47.880 --> 29:49.440
and making sure
you have enough chili.

29:49.440 --> 29:51.600
Mm, good man.
Also,

29:51.600 --> 29:54.800
you left...
this in our room.

29:54.800 --> 29:56.320
Mom's been texting.

29:56.320 --> 29:57.760
(exasperated groan)

29:57.760 --> 29:59.200
Trying to come up
with a better response

29:59.200 --> 30:01.440
than, "Go duck
yourself."
(laughs)

30:03.760 --> 30:05.800
(softly):
You should come with me.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.840
The Ortecho sisters
take California.

30:09.840 --> 30:11.840
(laughs)

30:11.840 --> 30:13.840
I wish.

30:13.840 --> 30:16.080
But I can't.

30:16.080 --> 30:19.120
I'm going back to rehab tonight.

30:21.120 --> 30:24.160
I want to see
the program through.

30:24.160 --> 30:25.320
Sorry.

30:27.120 --> 30:29.080
(softly):
Don't be.

30:29.080 --> 30:32.920
It's the best possible thing
you could have said.

30:37.200 --> 30:39.440
You know...

30:39.440 --> 30:41.880
Max should be your
road trip buddy.

30:41.880 --> 30:43.520
You love him.

30:43.520 --> 30:46.080
You're gonna forgive him.

30:46.080 --> 30:49.080
Besides, we both know if you try
to leave town without him again,

30:49.080 --> 30:51.840
he's just gonna show up
with some big, grand

30:51.840 --> 30:54.200
romantic gesture
to stop you.

31:17.600 --> 31:21.160

31:21.160 --> 31:23.680
Feels like my dad's

Flint should be okay.
