<i>Some days,
my childhood feels so very far away.</i>

00:20.092 --> 00:22.342
<i>And others,</i>

00:22.425 --> 00:25.592
<i>I can almost see it.</i>

00:25.675 --> 00:28.175
<i>The magical land of my youth,</i>

00:28.258 --> 00:33.633
<i>like a beautiful dream of when the
whole world felt like a promise</i>

00:33.717 --> 00:38.258
<i>and the lessons that lay ahead
yet unseen.</i>

00:38.342 --> 00:41.967
<i>Looking back,
I wish I'd listened.</i>

00:42.050 --> 00:44.717
<i>Wish I'd watched more closely</i>

00:44.800 --> 00:46.842
<i>and understood.</i>

00:46.925 --> 00:50.300
<i>But sometimes you can't see
what you're learning</i>

00:50.383 --> 00:53.508
<i>until you come out
the other side.</i>

01:42.758 --> 01:44.342
Come on!

02:00.300 --> 02:02.467
Come on!

02:09.092 --> 02:10.133
Come on!

02:44.925 --> 02:47.758
I'm gonna miss out.

02:51.092 --> 02:52.842
I've seen this contest

02:52.925 --> 02:56.467
humble even the most
seasoned warriors, Diana.

02:56.550 --> 02:58.258
I can do it.

02:59.175 --> 03:01.342
Just do your best.

03:01.425 --> 03:02.758
And remember,

03:02.842 --> 03:05.758
greatness is not
what you think.

03:05.842 --> 03:07.800
Pace yourself and watch.

09:18.217 --> 09:19.342
No!

09:27.800 --> 09:29.008
No!

09:29.092 --> 09:30.467
That's not fair!

09:31.217 --> 09:32.342
No.

09:32.425 --> 09:34.217
No. But...

09:34.300 --> 09:36.508
- You took the short path.
- But...

09:36.592 --> 09:38.133
- You cheated, Diana.
- No.

09:38.217 --> 09:39.175
But that...

09:39.258 --> 09:41.633
That is the truth.

09:41.717 --> 09:43.175
That is the only truth,

09:43.258 --> 09:45.342
and truth is all there is.

09:45.425 --> 09:46.800
But I would've won,
if you didn't...

09:46.883 --> 09:48.842
But you didn't.

09:48.925 --> 09:53.092
You cannot be the winner,
because you are not ready to win,

09:53.175 --> 09:55.133
and there is no shame in that.

09:57.258 --> 09:59.883
Only in knowing
the truth in your heart

09:59.967 --> 10:02.217
and not accepting it.

10:02.300 --> 10:05.842
No true hero is born from lies.

10:11.717 --> 10:13.550
Your time will come, Diana.

10:13.633 --> 10:15.383
When?

10:16.758 --> 10:18.967
When you're ready.

10:20.133 --> 10:22.508
Look to the
Golden Warrior Asteria.

10:24.092 --> 10:27.217
She did not become a legend
out of haste.

10:27.300 --> 10:31.092
She did it through
true acts of bravery.

10:31.175 --> 10:34.467
Like patience, diligence,

10:34.550 --> 10:37.800
and the courage
to face the truth.

10:43.300 --> 10:47.717
One day, you'll become
all that you dream of and more,

10:47.800 --> 10:51.508
and everything
will be different.

10:51.592 --> 10:56.883
This world is not yet ready
for all that you will do.

11:20.342 --> 11:22.883
<i>Welcome to the future.</i>

11:22.967 --> 11:26.092
<i>Life is good,
but it can be better.</i>

11:26.175 --> 11:27.758
<i>And why shouldn't it be?</i>

11:27.842 --> 11:29.425
<i>Everything we've
ever dreamed about</i>

11:29.508 --> 11:31.425
<i>is right at our fingertips.</i>

11:31.508 --> 11:34.175
<i>But are you
reaping the rewards?</i>

11:34.258 --> 11:35.342
<i>Do you...</i>

11:35.425 --> 11:36.883
<i>...have it all?</i>

11:42.175 --> 11:43.217
Slow down, dude.

11:43.300 --> 11:44.342
No way.

11:58.550 --> 11:59.925
Dude!

12:00.008 --> 12:02.008
<i>Welcome to
Black Gold Cooperative.</i>

12:02.092 --> 12:03.883
- Oh, my gosh. Guys!
- <i>The first oil company</i>

12:03.967 --> 12:06.217
<i>run for the people,
by the people.</i>

12:06.300 --> 12:07.717
<i>Think about finally having</i>

12:07.800 --> 12:09.925
<i>everything you've
always wished for.</i>

12:10.008 --> 12:11.092
Let's go!

12:11.175 --> 12:12.675
Hey!

12:14.675 --> 12:16.008
<i>For a low monthly fee,</i>

12:16.092 --> 12:17.758
<i>you can own a piece</i>

12:17.842 --> 12:20.800
<i>of the most lucrative industry
in the world.</i>

12:20.883 --> 12:23.175
<i>And every time we strike gold,</i>

12:23.258 --> 12:25.133
- <i>you strike gold.</i>
- Oh!

12:33.217 --> 12:36.842
<i>No matter who you
are, no matter what you do,</i>

12:36.925 --> 12:39.758
<i>you deserve to have it all.</i>

12:39.842 --> 12:43.217
<i>Do you have everything
you've ever wanted?</i>

12:43.300 --> 12:46.675
<i>Aren't you tired of
always wishing you had more?</i>

12:46.758 --> 12:49.092
- Hey, move it. It's my turn.
- <i>Join me today.</i>

12:49.175 --> 12:51.133
- Yes!
- <i>Operators are standing by.</i>

12:51.217 --> 12:55.383
<i>You don't need a pile of money or
some business degree to get started.</i>

12:55.467 --> 12:57.550
<i>You don't even have
to work hard for it.</i>

12:57.633 --> 12:59.550
Good morning.

12:59.633 --> 13:01.342
- Good morning.
- Don't even think about it.

13:01.425 --> 13:04.467
<i>At Black Gold
Cooperative, all you need</i>

13:04.550 --> 13:06.217
<i>is to want it!</i>

13:10.258 --> 13:13.050
We get what we want,
and we go.

13:13.133 --> 13:15.592
- What do you want?
- None of this junk.

13:15.675 --> 13:17.550
Word is on the street

13:17.633 --> 13:20.050
you got a nice little black market
side business going on back there.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.092
If you don't tell,
we won't tell.

13:24.592 --> 13:27.425
Yes, yes, yes!

13:30.300 --> 13:33.008
Oh, thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

13:34.467 --> 13:36.633
Yes, yes, yes!

13:51.050 --> 13:52.883
Sir, are you all right?

13:53.675 --> 13:54.758
Gun!

13:54.842 --> 13:56.425
He's got a gun!

13:56.508 --> 13:59.675
Shut up! Please!

13:59.758 --> 14:01.258
Come on, dude. Can't hide.
Let's get out of here!

14:01.342 --> 14:03.092
Stop! Mall Security!

14:03.175 --> 14:04.842
No, no, you, you, right there!

14:04.925 --> 14:06.925
Right there! Freeze. Stop!

14:07.008 --> 14:08.217
Move, move, move!

14:08.300 --> 14:09.425
Chief, they're running up
the escalator.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.800
Hey! Stop! Freeze!

14:12.342 --> 14:13.425
Freeze!

14:13.508 --> 14:14.883
No!

14:18.300 --> 14:20.342
We have several
armed assailants running free.

14:20.425 --> 14:22.425
We need the police here,
right now.

14:24.842 --> 14:25.925
Freeze!

14:26.008 --> 14:26.967
Freeze!

14:28.175 --> 14:29.842
Freeze! Freeze!

14:29.925 --> 14:32.050
Whoa, whoa! Hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

14:32.133 --> 14:33.592
No. Dude, dude, calm...

14:33.675 --> 14:35.342
- Get back, man. I'll do it!
- Hey!

14:35.425 --> 14:36.675
Hey, what are you doing?

14:36.758 --> 14:38.133
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.

14:38.217 --> 14:39.425
What are you doing?

14:40.550 --> 14:41.842
Hey, what are you doing?

14:41.925 --> 14:43.592
- I'm not going back!
- No, no, no!

14:44.925 --> 14:46.133
Just chill out.
Just chill.

14:46.217 --> 14:48.383
- Stand back!
- Don't do it!

14:48.467 --> 14:50.175
No, no, no!

14:50.258 --> 14:52.092
Put the kid back.

14:52.175 --> 14:53.592
Listen to me.

14:53.675 --> 14:55.967
Listen to me!

14:56.050 --> 14:57.300
- No!
- What are you doing?

14:57.383 --> 14:59.800
Pull her back.
Pull her back in!

14:59.883 --> 15:01.133
I'm not going back!

15:01.217 --> 15:02.342
No!

15:02.425 --> 15:03.508
Gonna let her go!

15:03.592 --> 15:05.092
- No, no, no!
- No, no!

15:13.133 --> 15:14.258
What? Who? What?

15:26.092 --> 15:27.758
We won't be doing that today.

15:43.842 --> 15:45.217
Whoa.

15:53.050 --> 15:54.717
We... We... We should go...

15:54.800 --> 15:57.383
Oh, my gosh!

15:58.675 --> 16:00.217
Hold tight.

16:11.175 --> 16:12.550
I hate guns.

16:12.633 --> 16:14.300
We've got to go now. Come on.

16:43.342 --> 16:45.008
Yo.

16:46.383 --> 16:48.258
I'm sorry, lady.

16:48.342 --> 16:50.092
- Shh.
- I'm sorry. Okay?

16:50.175 --> 16:52.217
It was his idea.

17:01.675 --> 17:03.800
<i>And the
authorities still have questions.</i>

17:03.883 --> 17:06.467
<i>In fact, the first is
a real doozy, which is,</i>

17:06.550 --> 17:09.383
<i>who exactly
even stopped this crime?</i>

17:09.467 --> 17:11.967
If the story around here
is to be believed,

17:12.050 --> 17:13.925
it wasn't the police,

17:14.008 --> 17:16.967
but a mysterious female savior

17:17.050 --> 17:18.633
that multiple witnesses saw.

17:18.717 --> 17:21.592
<i>If this sounds familiar,
it should.</i>

17:21.675 --> 17:25.050
<i>We've now had more than
a half-dozen similar sightings</i>

17:25.133 --> 17:28.592
<i>across the greater D.C. area
in the last year.</i>

17:28.675 --> 17:31.633
<i>Which, of course,
begs the biggest question of today,</i>

17:31.717 --> 17:33.800
<i>who is this woman</i>

17:33.883 --> 17:36.258
<i>and where did she come from?</i>

18:53.050 --> 18:55.550
Excuse me.
Are you waiting for someone?

18:55.633 --> 18:57.842
No. Just me.

19:15.967 --> 19:17.383
Taxi!

19:24.092 --> 19:26.092
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't see you there.

19:26.175 --> 19:28.758
Hey, we could share,
if you like?

19:28.842 --> 19:31.217
No, thanks. I'll wait.

20:15.342 --> 20:16.967
Oh, my.

20:20.383 --> 20:22.133
- Yeah.
- Hey, Jake.

20:22.217 --> 20:23.842
Jake, hi. Can you...

20:27.842 --> 20:31.967
Hi. I know, walk much?
The latch of my...

20:35.633 --> 20:36.800
Good morning.

20:37.467 --> 20:39.050
Hi. Thank you.

20:39.133 --> 20:42.800
Diana Prince,
cultural anthropology and archaeology.

20:42.883 --> 20:45.508
Barbara Minerva.
Geology, gemology, lithology,

20:45.592 --> 20:47.133
and part-time cryptozoologist.

20:47.217 --> 20:48.008
Oh, wow.

20:48.092 --> 20:50.217
I kept busy in college.

20:52.925 --> 20:55.883
Sorry. It's these heels,
you know. It's stupid.

20:55.967 --> 20:58.258
I don't know why I was gonna wear heels.
Scientists don't wear heels.

20:58.342 --> 21:00.925
- Sometimes we do.
- Right.

21:01.008 --> 21:03.050
- Right. Those are cool!
- Have a nice day.

21:03.133 --> 21:04.217
I like those.

21:04.300 --> 21:05.592
Animal print.

21:06.842 --> 21:08.175
Do you want to get lunch?

21:08.842 --> 21:09.717
I, uh...

21:09.800 --> 21:11.258
Not now, obviously.

21:11.342 --> 21:14.050
It's morning.
But later today, or whenever.

21:14.133 --> 21:16.175
Like, around...
Like, at lunchtime?

21:16.258 --> 21:17.925
I have a lot of work today.

21:18.008 --> 21:20.258
- But maybe some other time?
- Oh.

21:20.342 --> 21:23.008
- Yeah, I'm busy today, too.
- Great.

21:23.092 --> 21:27.008
Ah! Diana, do you happen to
know who a Barbara Minerva is?

21:27.092 --> 21:28.800
Oh, hi, Carol. Hi.

21:28.883 --> 21:32.008
It's me. I'm Barbara.
Remember? You hired me.

21:32.092 --> 21:34.383
- Started last week.
- Oh!

21:34.467 --> 21:35.758
Gemologist?

21:35.842 --> 21:37.425
Yes. And zoologist.

21:37.508 --> 21:39.508
- We had a couple interviews.
- Yeah.

21:39.592 --> 21:43.008
Well, the FBI are gonna drop off
some artifacts later this afternoon.

21:43.092 --> 21:44.383
The FBI?

21:44.467 --> 21:46.300
- Yeah. Yes.
- They're coming here?

21:46.383 --> 21:47.883
The mall heist yesterday,

21:47.967 --> 21:50.050
apparently they were using
a jewelry store as a front.

21:50.133 --> 21:51.842
Front for what?

21:51.925 --> 21:54.758
Black market. Stolen jewels and
art meant for private buyers.

21:54.842 --> 21:57.008
But we could use your help
identifying one in particular.

21:57.092 --> 21:59.883
My help?
Yeah, I'll help the FBI

21:59.967 --> 22:01.717
with whatever they need.

22:01.800 --> 22:02.925
Is that a yes?

22:03.008 --> 22:04.258
Yes. I would, um...

22:04.342 --> 22:06.342
- I would love to assist you.
- Wonderful.

22:06.425 --> 22:08.550
It's nice to meet you.

22:08.633 --> 22:10.258
We've met.

22:11.300 --> 22:13.258
Have a nice day.

22:13.342 --> 22:14.633
Bye, Diana.

22:16.842 --> 22:20.925
Okay, item number 23.

22:21.008 --> 22:22.842
Shoot. That's not it.

22:28.008 --> 22:30.800
Oh, the Empress of Siam.

22:30.883 --> 22:34.800
Originally found in the wreck
of the <i>Nuestra Senora de Atocha.</i>

22:35.508 --> 22:36.592
Wow.

22:36.675 --> 22:40.092
Sorry. I couldn't resist
coming to see.

22:40.175 --> 22:42.050
Oh, it's okay.

22:43.092 --> 22:44.092
Here it is.

22:44.175 --> 22:46.592
- What is it?
- Um...

22:47.800 --> 22:48.967
Uh...

22:49.758 --> 22:51.675
I can't tell.

22:54.217 --> 22:55.925
Some light.

22:58.258 --> 23:03.008
I think the technical term here
is "extremely lame."

23:03.092 --> 23:05.092
Um...

23:05.175 --> 23:07.550
It's... It's citrine.

23:07.633 --> 23:11.425
A classic stone used in fakes
throughout history.

23:11.508 --> 23:15.300
I can't imagine this is worth
any more than $75.

23:15.383 --> 23:16.592
What do you think?

23:16.675 --> 23:19.258
Fakes aren't my forte,
but let me see.

23:20.092 --> 23:21.133
Mmm.

23:21.217 --> 23:22.508
Latin.

23:22.592 --> 23:24.300
At least
it's an antique, right?

23:24.383 --> 23:27.300
Or a purchase from a stall
on the Ponte Vecchio last week.

23:27.383 --> 23:29.633
- Mmm-hmm.
- You never know.

23:29.717 --> 23:33.133
"Place upon the object held

23:33.217 --> 23:34.925
but one great wish."

23:35.008 --> 23:36.300
You read Latin?

23:36.383 --> 23:39.342
Yeah. Yeah.
Languages are a hobby.

23:39.425 --> 23:41.342
So maybe it's, like,
a lucky charm or something?

23:41.425 --> 23:42.717
Yeah, I guess.

23:42.800 --> 23:44.050
Strange.

23:44.133 --> 23:46.050
I really wish I had a coffee.

23:47.008 --> 23:48.842
You're funny.

23:48.925 --> 23:50.383
Hey, I got Erika a coffee, but she's
out sick. Does anybody want this?

23:50.467 --> 23:53.050
What?
Yeah, I'll take one.

23:53.883 --> 23:54.800
Ooh, hot!

23:54.883 --> 23:55.925
Hot, hot!

23:56.008 --> 23:57.425
Did you see that?

23:59.883 --> 24:01.050
Oh...

24:02.008 --> 24:03.883
Can you imagine?

24:03.967 --> 24:06.175
- If only.
- Hmm.

24:07.800 --> 24:11.675
So many things,
I don't even know what I would wish for.

24:16.217 --> 24:18.258
I do.

24:20.800 --> 24:23.967
Well, um, anyway,
sorry to bother you.

24:24.050 --> 24:26.550
If you need anything,
I'm around.

24:26.633 --> 24:28.092
- Oh, yeah, I'm good.
- Yeah.

24:28.175 --> 24:29.800
But thank you for...

24:29.883 --> 24:31.800
That's okay. It's my job.

24:31.883 --> 24:33.842
And I'll look into it more
when I have a chance.

24:33.925 --> 24:34.883
Okay.

24:34.967 --> 24:37.675
Well, thanks for...

24:37.758 --> 24:40.342
talking to me.

24:40.425 --> 24:42.425
I'm... I'm sorry, uh...

24:43.092 --> 24:45.175
I mean, I'm fine.

24:45.258 --> 24:47.383
You know, we could go
and grab early dinner

24:47.467 --> 24:52.508
and talk about exactly
how lame that stone is.

24:52.592 --> 24:53.592
Really?

24:53.675 --> 24:55.217
Yeah, I mean, citrine?

24:55.300 --> 24:57.508
Who are they kidding, right?

24:57.592 --> 24:58.967
- So lame.
- Dorky.

24:59.050 --> 25:00.383
- Lame.
- Yeah, let's go.

25:00.467 --> 25:02.967
That's, like,
the lamest of lames.

25:31.925 --> 25:34.633
Wow. You're so funny.

25:34.717 --> 25:36.842
- Oh. Thank you.
- Wow.

25:36.925 --> 25:40.675
I mean, no one's made me laugh
like this in such a long time.

25:40.758 --> 25:43.050
I mean, it's true,
I don't get out much socially.

25:43.175 --> 25:44.800
You don't get out much?

25:44.883 --> 25:46.050
No, not really.

25:46.133 --> 25:47.717
- No.
- I'm sorry. I'm just surprised.

25:47.800 --> 25:50.133
Because you just seem like
the kind of person

25:50.217 --> 25:51.633
who's, like, always out.

25:51.717 --> 25:53.675
Like, people are asking you
to go out all the time

25:53.758 --> 25:55.967
and you live out.
You're just out.

25:56.050 --> 25:58.550
Like, you never get in.

25:58.633 --> 26:01.342
You just seem
like you'd be really popular.

26:01.425 --> 26:03.467
And I would know because
I've never been popular.

26:03.550 --> 26:04.633
You haven't?

26:04.717 --> 26:06.133
You're so personable.

26:06.217 --> 26:09.258
So... free.

26:09.342 --> 26:12.842
I mean, honestly,
I gotta say that I envy that.

26:12.925 --> 26:14.133
What?

26:14.217 --> 26:16.967
You envy me?
That doesn't make any sense.

26:17.050 --> 26:19.050
Oh, my gosh.

26:19.133 --> 26:21.258
People think I'm weird.
They avoid me

26:21.342 --> 26:24.175
and talk behind my back when
they don't think I can hear them.

26:24.258 --> 26:26.300
I'm like, "Guys,
I can hear you."

26:30.383 --> 26:32.592
Barbara, my life

26:32.675 --> 26:35.967
hasn't been
what you probably think it has.

26:37.217 --> 26:39.342
We all have our struggles.

26:39.425 --> 26:40.425
Yeah, we do.

26:42.758 --> 26:44.217
Have you ever been in love?

26:46.592 --> 26:48.717
Uh... Yeah.

26:48.800 --> 26:51.383
- A long, long time ago.
- Mmm.

26:51.467 --> 26:52.550
You?

26:52.633 --> 26:54.842
So many times, yeah.
All the time.

26:54.925 --> 26:56.550
Often.

26:56.633 --> 26:57.842
So what happened?

26:57.925 --> 27:00.008
Where'd he go, your guy?

27:00.092 --> 27:01.717
He, uh...

27:02.342 --> 27:04.342
He died.

27:04.425 --> 27:10.050
But I still think sometimes that
I see him up there in the sky.

27:10.133 --> 27:11.217
He was a pilot.

27:11.300 --> 27:14.425
- Oh!
- He was all kinds of things,

27:14.508 --> 27:18.050
but he was great. It was true.

27:19.758 --> 27:21.717
I get it.

27:21.800 --> 27:24.050
Well, cheers to us.

27:24.133 --> 27:27.383
Wishing us better luck,
I guess.

27:34.800 --> 27:35.925
Hey, Leon.

27:36.008 --> 27:37.550
Hey there, Barbara. Late night?

27:37.633 --> 27:39.133
Yeah. Going back to work.

27:39.217 --> 27:41.300
I wanted to bring this to you
while it was still hot.

27:41.383 --> 27:44.217
- Oh, you're too good to me.
- It's not a problem.

27:44.300 --> 27:45.717
Stay warm.

27:54.717 --> 27:57.925
Hey there, sweetheart.
You need some help?

27:58.008 --> 27:59.383
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

28:00.133 --> 28:01.925
'Cause, uh,

28:02.008 --> 28:04.883
you know, you look as though you're
having a little bit of trouble

28:04.967 --> 28:06.175
walking in those heels, huh?

28:06.258 --> 28:07.550
It's okay. I wear
these heels all the time.

28:07.633 --> 28:09.383
Hey, come on.
Let me walk you home.

28:09.467 --> 28:12.008
- I'm not going home.
- Hey, I'm just trying to be nice here.

28:12.092 --> 28:14.467
Huh? Come on.

28:14.550 --> 28:18.425
Hey, hey. Hey, hey!

28:18.508 --> 28:20.008
- What are you doing?
- Hey, hey!

28:20.092 --> 28:21.592
Let go of me!

28:21.675 --> 28:23.008
- I'm just trying to help you!
- Let go of me! Let go of me!

28:23.092 --> 28:25.550
Let go!

28:38.717 --> 28:41.467
Forgot my keys. Lucky.

28:41.550 --> 28:43.300
- How did you...
- Simple self-defense.

28:43.383 --> 28:45.633
Used his own momentum against him.
I'll teach you.

28:45.717 --> 28:48.050
Honestly, it takes
no power at all.

28:49.342 --> 28:50.383
Are you okay?

28:50.467 --> 28:52.967
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Good.

28:53.050 --> 28:54.508
- Thank you.
- Of course.

28:54.592 --> 28:55.758
Go home, okay?

28:55.842 --> 28:57.717
- Yeah.
- Good night.

29:36.383 --> 29:39.217
I do know what I'd wish for.

29:41.883 --> 29:44.300
To be like Diana.

29:45.258 --> 29:49.175
Strong, sexy,

29:49.258 --> 29:51.217
cool.

29:54.342 --> 29:56.467
Special.

30:57.175 --> 30:58.133
Oh...

31:29.467 --> 31:30.717
Oh, no! Oh!

31:30.800 --> 31:32.092
Sorry.

31:33.258 --> 31:34.467
Oh, it's okay.

31:34.550 --> 31:36.050
Barbara, thank God
you're good in heels.

31:36.133 --> 31:37.717
Oh.

31:39.050 --> 31:41.300
- Hey, Barbara.
- Hi, Jake.

31:41.383 --> 31:43.300
Wow. Looking good.

31:43.383 --> 31:45.467
- Oh, thanks.
- Yeah.

31:45.550 --> 31:48.592
This is our
Earth Sciences lab.

31:49.258 --> 31:50.550
Oh, Barbara!

31:50.633 --> 31:51.717
Hi.

31:52.842 --> 31:53.967
Perfect.

31:54.050 --> 31:55.592
I have someone
I would like you to meet.

31:55.675 --> 31:58.175
- A pleasure, Ms. Minerva.
- Oh.

31:58.258 --> 32:01.050
Uh,
it's "Doctor," actually.

32:01.133 --> 32:03.342
Um... Have we met before?
You look familiar.

32:03.425 --> 32:06.050
- Do the thing. Do the thing.
- No.

32:06.133 --> 32:09.258
Life is good,
but it can be better.

32:10.592 --> 32:11.925
Oh, my gosh. From TV.

32:12.008 --> 32:13.633
Oh, my gosh.
You're the oil guy.

32:13.717 --> 32:16.133
- "The oil guy." I'll take it.
- That's right.

32:17.550 --> 32:19.383
Mr. Lord is considering

32:19.467 --> 32:21.925
becoming a Friend of the
Smithsonian at the Partner level.

32:22.008 --> 32:23.842
- Oh.
- Which entitles him to a handful

32:23.925 --> 32:25.050
of private tours
of our facilities,

32:25.133 --> 32:27.633
and he asked for you by name.

32:27.717 --> 32:30.342
- Me?
- Well, what can I say, Doctor?

32:30.425 --> 32:32.175
Your reputation precedes you.

32:32.258 --> 32:36.133
And apparently we share
a passion for gemology.

32:36.217 --> 32:39.008
- Wow, okay. We do.
- I'll leave you to it.

32:39.092 --> 32:40.633
Uh...

32:40.717 --> 32:43.300
Oh, let me just drop this off
in my office,

32:43.383 --> 32:45.258
and we'll go.

33:05.800 --> 33:09.508
Oh! Oh, gosh. Don't look in there.
It's such a mess.

33:11.133 --> 33:14.675
So, I thought maybe
we could start upstairs.

33:19.425 --> 33:21.425
I love that ruby.

33:21.508 --> 33:22.758
Oh, no. Be careful with that.

33:22.842 --> 33:24.425
- What?
- That's very...

33:26.175 --> 33:28.717
Hey, have you seen
my friend? Where'd he go?

33:28.800 --> 33:30.092
- I'm right here.
- You are.

33:30.175 --> 33:31.800
Thank God.

33:31.883 --> 33:33.217
Oh, wait. You've got
a little dust on you.

33:33.300 --> 33:34.592
- Sorry.
- Hey, good morning.

33:34.675 --> 33:35.592
Oh, hi.

33:35.675 --> 33:37.050
- Hi.
- Oh! Uh...

33:37.133 --> 33:39.592
This is the one and only,

33:39.675 --> 33:41.717
Mr. Maxwell Lord.

33:42.675 --> 33:44.508
It's him.

33:45.925 --> 33:47.092
Life is good,

33:48.342 --> 33:49.592
but it can be better.

33:51.467 --> 33:53.092
He's from TV.

33:53.175 --> 33:54.425
Oh, I don't have a TV.

33:54.508 --> 33:56.092
Well, I have a great
relationship with Sears.

33:56.175 --> 33:58.425
I can get you a brand-new TV
by the end of the day.

33:58.508 --> 34:00.175
Nineteen inches.

34:00.258 --> 34:02.633
- No strings attached.
- I'll stick to the one I don't have.

34:02.717 --> 34:04.258
But thank you.

34:04.342 --> 34:05.300
Okay.

34:05.383 --> 34:08.050
You're so generous. Um...

34:08.132 --> 34:09.842
Headline... Uh...

34:09.925 --> 34:11.007
Mr. Lord

34:11.092 --> 34:14.467
took a tour
of the entire Smithsonian

34:14.550 --> 34:16.300
while considering partnership,

34:16.382 --> 34:18.842
and guess
what he decided to do?

34:18.925 --> 34:20.842
Give his entire donation

34:20.925 --> 34:23.007
to our department.

34:23.092 --> 34:25.175
He's announcing it
at tonight's Members' Gala.

34:25.257 --> 34:26.675
It's going to be
an amazing party.

34:26.757 --> 34:29.050
I hope you have
something nice to wear.

34:29.132 --> 34:31.175
I actually tend
to skip these events.

34:31.257 --> 34:35.132
I find that our benefactors with
a true eye towards philanthropy

34:35.217 --> 34:37.132
prefer to stay
out of the spotlight.

34:37.217 --> 34:39.717
To let the museum's work
garner the attention.

34:39.800 --> 34:40.967
I agree.

34:41.050 --> 34:42.050
Except,

34:42.132 --> 34:45.967
I like to party.

34:46.050 --> 34:48.800
Oh, my gosh.
You're such a good dancer.

34:48.882 --> 34:50.092
- You like Latin dancing?
- I love it.

34:50.175 --> 34:51.717
I know that
I'm a terrible dancer.

34:51.800 --> 34:53.257
No, I doubt that
you're a terrible dancer...

34:53.342 --> 34:55.007
No, I've got a hip injury
from high school.

34:55.092 --> 34:56.050
...the shape that you're in.

34:56.132 --> 34:57.550
Great, so,

34:57.633 --> 34:59.883
- thank you so much for coming.
- Oh, yeah.

34:59.967 --> 35:01.550
You know,
I really should be going.

35:01.633 --> 35:02.800
Thank you for the tour.

35:02.883 --> 35:06.175
I will have to see you tonight.

35:06.258 --> 35:08.425
See you tonight.

35:08.508 --> 35:11.300
Bye. Have a good day.

35:12.383 --> 35:13.550
I'll find you.

35:16.967 --> 35:18.217
What?

35:19.175 --> 35:21.342
I like him.

35:30.425 --> 35:31.758
Thank you, John.

35:36.758 --> 35:38.425
Ladies.

35:38.508 --> 35:40.467
Mr. Lord.

35:40.550 --> 35:41.550
Mr. Lord.

35:41.633 --> 35:43.383
Not now, Raquel.
My supplements?

35:43.467 --> 35:47.342
On your desk,
but Mr. Lord.

35:47.967 --> 35:49.842
Mr. Lord.

35:54.383 --> 35:56.008
Mr. Lord.

36:17.967 --> 36:19.217
Mr. Lord.

36:20.758 --> 36:22.342
Mr. Lord.

36:22.425 --> 36:23.342
Dad!

36:23.425 --> 36:24.467
How?

36:25.175 --> 36:26.967
How!

36:27.050 --> 36:28.508
It's your weekend.

36:28.592 --> 36:30.592
Yes, clearly.

36:30.675 --> 36:33.592
Alistair.

36:33.675 --> 36:34.883
Where's the pool, Daddy?

36:34.967 --> 36:36.842
It's not done yet, buddy.

36:36.925 --> 36:38.758
But it doesn't matter.

36:38.842 --> 36:40.633
You just have
to be patient.

36:40.717 --> 36:43.050
I told you the pool,

36:43.133 --> 36:44.633
the helicopter,

36:44.717 --> 36:47.425
you'll have it all.
But remember,

36:47.508 --> 36:50.425
Rome wasn't built in a day,
was it? No.

36:50.508 --> 36:52.467
Hasn't it been
a lot of days?

36:52.550 --> 36:55.467
Well, it takes time
to become a great, great,

36:55.550 --> 36:58.800
number-one man,
like your dad is going to be.

36:58.883 --> 37:02.300
Are you lying to your son,
like you lie to everyone else?

37:06.967 --> 37:08.217
Simon.

37:09.717 --> 37:11.300
These offices aren't ready
for guests yet.

37:11.383 --> 37:13.758
It's over, Max.

37:13.842 --> 37:16.467
I don't want to hear it anymore.
I'm out.

37:16.550 --> 37:18.050
Alistair, go wait with Raquel.

37:18.133 --> 37:19.050
Simon.

37:20.633 --> 37:22.467
I know it's hard
to see right now,

37:22.550 --> 37:25.133
but we are finally right at the
edge of turning this thing around.

37:25.217 --> 37:27.050
"Turning it around"?

37:27.133 --> 37:30.300
There is no oil.
There never was.

37:30.383 --> 37:32.675
So how are you gonna
turn it around?

37:32.758 --> 37:35.675
Get more
sucker investors, like me?

37:35.758 --> 37:37.467
- It's called a Ponzi scheme.
- No!

37:37.550 --> 37:39.758
I have a big...

37:39.842 --> 37:42.092
There's something in the works.

37:42.175 --> 37:43.967
And it's no scheme.

37:44.050 --> 37:48.467
Simon, we have millions of acres
of potentially oil-rich land.

37:48.550 --> 37:50.883
You have oil rights on land

37:50.967 --> 37:53.008
that everyone else
passed on already.

37:53.092 --> 37:54.550
Now, it didn't take
much digging

37:54.633 --> 37:55.925
to find that out.

37:56.008 --> 37:58.050
I should have
done some digging on you, too,

37:58.133 --> 37:59.925
Maxwell Lorenzano.

38:00.008 --> 38:03.175
Didn't take long to find out you're
nothing but a lowlife con man.

38:03.258 --> 38:05.633
I am not a con man!

38:08.758 --> 38:12.050
I am a television personality.

38:12.133 --> 38:13.550
And a respected businessman

38:13.633 --> 38:15.050
- with a plan.
- Come on.

38:15.133 --> 38:17.883
- With... With... With a great plan.
- Oh!

38:17.967 --> 38:20.550
"If you can dream it,
you can have it."

38:20.633 --> 38:22.550
Something like that?

38:23.883 --> 38:26.217
You have 48 hours

38:26.300 --> 38:28.383
- to get my money...
- You're going to regret this.

38:28.467 --> 38:31.592
...or the FTC gets an anonymous report.

38:31.675 --> 38:33.758
- Loser.
- Simon, wait.

38:33.842 --> 38:36.258
Simon, wait.

38:45.633 --> 38:47.550
I am not a loser.

38:48.842 --> 38:51.050
He's a loser!

38:51.133 --> 38:54.092
And don't you ever believe
a word that man said.

38:54.175 --> 38:56.550
He's a liar...

38:56.633 --> 38:58.925
and he's wrong.

39:01.008 --> 39:05.133
And he will rue the day
he walked away from me.

39:12.800 --> 39:14.425
And you...

39:16.675 --> 39:21.592
You are going to be so proud
to be my son.

39:23.342 --> 39:25.300
Okay.

39:29.925 --> 39:31.883
You'll see.

39:34.217 --> 39:36.092
Everyone will.

40:20.050 --> 40:22.675
These are known
for a terrific fit.

40:22.758 --> 40:26.508
Yeah, I'm just
not so great with heels.

40:26.592 --> 40:28.133
Just try them.

40:29.883 --> 40:32.675
Come out and show me.

40:32.758 --> 40:34.550
Okay. Hmm.

40:43.467 --> 40:44.883
They do fit well.

40:44.967 --> 40:45.967
Ah.

40:46.050 --> 40:47.133
Huh.

40:51.133 --> 40:53.633
- Yeah, I like it.
- You look

40:53.717 --> 40:55.258
amazing.

40:55.342 --> 40:56.675
Do you think it's too tight?

40:56.758 --> 40:59.175
I think it's just right.

40:59.258 --> 41:01.133
- Wow.
- Yeah.

41:02.675 --> 41:04.217
I'll take it.

41:23.383 --> 41:25.175
Hey there. How are you doing?

41:53.342 --> 41:55.258
- Those shoes are incredible.
- Thank you.

41:55.342 --> 41:58.008
- What a beautiful dress.
- You look fantastic.

41:58.092 --> 41:59.842
Thank you so much.

42:09.342 --> 42:10.508
Dr. Minerva.

42:12.508 --> 42:16.133
You look breathtaking.

42:17.008 --> 42:18.758
Thank you.

42:18.842 --> 42:22.550
I... You know, we have to go to
these sort of things for work a lot,

42:22.633 --> 42:25.050
so I've probably worn this
dress a million times.

42:25.133 --> 42:26.217
Mmm.

42:26.300 --> 42:27.467
Um...

42:27.550 --> 42:30.467
- Actually, no.
- I...

42:30.550 --> 42:32.425
I just bought this today.

42:32.508 --> 42:35.133
I never look like this.
Um, not even close.

42:35.217 --> 42:37.717
Took me a long time
to get ready.

42:41.883 --> 42:43.925
Biotin.

42:44.717 --> 42:46.258
You should try it.

42:46.342 --> 42:48.800
Makes you glow like a teenager.

42:48.883 --> 42:50.133
Reverses the clock.

42:50.217 --> 42:53.258
Never accept
the limitations of nature.

42:53.342 --> 42:54.633
Yeah, no.

42:54.717 --> 42:57.050
Especially not
a beautiful woman like you.

42:57.133 --> 42:58.300
Oh...

43:01.508 --> 43:03.842
God, it's so loud in here.

43:03.925 --> 43:05.217
Yeah.

43:06.383 --> 43:08.342
Can we go somewhere?

43:08.425 --> 43:10.508
- Just me and you?
- Yes.

43:12.467 --> 43:13.842
Hmm... Your office?

43:25.342 --> 43:30.675
Oh, wow! Look at all
of this stuff. It's so...

43:30.758 --> 43:32.967
It's so beautiful.

43:34.592 --> 43:36.550
Like you.

43:42.133 --> 43:44.092
What is that?

43:44.175 --> 43:45.342
Um...

43:45.425 --> 43:48.383
Uh, it's nothing special,
really.

43:48.467 --> 43:52.508
But the FBI did ask me
to help them identify it.

43:52.592 --> 43:54.050
Wow.

43:54.133 --> 43:55.592
Though it certainly
has me stumped so far.

43:55.675 --> 43:57.508
Let me help you.

43:57.592 --> 44:00.550
Max is here. No need to be
stumped ever again.

44:00.633 --> 44:03.425
I have a dear friend
in Roman antiquities.

44:03.508 --> 44:06.175
- Roman antiquities.
- Could give it a look, if you like?

44:08.633 --> 44:10.925
It is Latin, isn't it?

44:13.467 --> 44:15.925
I really shouldn't let it
go out of the museum.

44:26.550 --> 44:29.467
- Hey there, beautiful.
- No, thank you. Excuse me.

44:30.175 --> 44:31.675
Oh, Diana.

44:32.508 --> 44:34.425
Hoping I'd see you.

44:34.508 --> 44:36.717
Hey, do you know
I'm at the White House now?

44:36.800 --> 44:40.758
Yeah, that's right. Interning,
but requested by name, so...

44:40.842 --> 44:43.633
Listen, I've had my eyes on you
for some time.

44:43.717 --> 44:46.633
- So if you ever need...
- That's great, Carl.

44:49.967 --> 44:52.008
Diana.

44:56.758 --> 44:58.425
Diana.

44:58.508 --> 45:01.133
Excuse me, I don't even know
you, so please stop following me.

45:06.175 --> 45:08.008
- Good night.
- But...

45:08.092 --> 45:10.383
I wish we had more time.

45:15.550 --> 45:17.008
Why did you say that?

45:17.925 --> 45:19.675
Don't say that to me.

45:19.758 --> 45:21.342
You don't even know me.

45:21.425 --> 45:23.758
Yes, I do.

45:34.717 --> 45:37.133
I can save today...

45:37.217 --> 45:40.092
but you can save the world.

45:47.967 --> 45:49.967
Steve?

45:53.925 --> 45:55.800
Diana.

45:58.550 --> 46:00.342
But how?

46:00.425 --> 46:02.633
I don't know.

46:08.842 --> 46:10.592
Oh, my God.

46:13.008 --> 46:14.175
It's you.

46:25.217 --> 46:27.592
I missed you.

46:30.550 --> 46:32.425
<i>So what do you remember?</i>

46:33.300 --> 46:35.842
I remember...

46:35.925 --> 46:37.550
I remember taking
the plane up...

46:37.633 --> 46:38.925
Mmm-hmm.

46:39.008 --> 46:40.883
...and then...

46:41.508 --> 46:44.175
nothing, really.

46:44.258 --> 46:45.675
Nothing.

46:45.758 --> 46:48.342
But somehow, I know
I've been someplace since then.

46:48.425 --> 46:51.092
Someplace that's, uh...

46:52.467 --> 46:55.342
I can't really put words to it.

46:55.425 --> 46:59.133
But it's... It's good.

47:04.925 --> 47:07.467
And then I, uh...
I woke up here.

47:07.550 --> 47:08.383
Where?

47:08.467 --> 47:11.883
I ended up in a bed. Uh...

47:11.967 --> 47:16.300
Strange, strange pillow bed
with slats.

47:16.383 --> 47:18.133
- A futon, yeah.
- A futon?

47:18.217 --> 47:19.592
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

47:19.675 --> 47:24.383
Well, not comfortable.
And really a bit backwards

47:24.467 --> 47:26.592
if I'm being
really honest with you.

47:26.675 --> 47:29.217
I mean, for a futuristic time
like this. Nineteen...

47:29.300 --> 47:32.967
Eighty-four. 1984.

47:42.675 --> 47:45.717
That's amazing.

47:59.217 --> 48:03.217
Would you like
to see my futon?

48:14.758 --> 48:16.550
Yeah. Um...

48:17.467 --> 48:19.592
You don't have to tell me.

48:19.675 --> 48:24.175
The place is a mess.
Cheese on demand.

48:24.258 --> 48:27.008
I spent all morning
cleaning his bedroom,

48:27.092 --> 48:30.425
but he seems to me
to be an engineer.

48:30.508 --> 48:32.925
Lots of pictures of himself.

48:33.008 --> 48:38.717
Not what I would do,
but to each his own.

48:38.800 --> 48:40.967
Oh, so this is
how you found me.

48:41.050 --> 48:43.342
Yeah, the phone book.

48:43.425 --> 48:46.008
I guess some things
are just future-proof.

48:46.092 --> 48:47.342
So you went to my apartment?

48:47.425 --> 48:48.925
Yeah, I tried to use
the bike at first.

48:49.008 --> 48:53.925
I couldn't really figure out
how to get it going,

48:54.008 --> 48:57.550
so I ran over
and saw you come back.

48:58.592 --> 49:02.675
And I was stunned.

49:04.383 --> 49:05.842
There you were.

49:07.717 --> 49:10.508
So I just, uh...

49:10.592 --> 49:12.967
followed you, like a creep.

49:16.092 --> 49:19.008
Diana, look at you. It's...

49:19.092 --> 49:23.425
It's like not one day
has passed.

49:23.508 --> 49:26.092
I can't say the same thing
about you.

49:26.175 --> 49:31.300
Right, right, right.
Right.

49:38.717 --> 49:40.300
Yeah, he's, uh...

50:07.008 --> 50:08.383
He's got it.

50:08.467 --> 50:11.175
No, I like him.

50:12.383 --> 50:16.925
He's great,
but all I see is you.

50:37.008 --> 50:41.217
"One great wish."
I've been waiting.

50:46.758 --> 50:49.425
I wish to be you.

50:49.508 --> 50:52.217
The Dreamstone itself.

51:51.342 --> 51:52.258
Hi.

51:54.092 --> 51:55.342
Come here.

51:55.425 --> 51:57.175
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

52:02.092 --> 52:03.675
Been eating Pop-Tarts
all morning,

52:03.758 --> 52:06.508
and I've had about
three pots of coffee.

52:06.592 --> 52:10.758
This place is amazing.

52:11.842 --> 52:13.592
- This place?
- Yeah.

52:13.675 --> 52:15.883
You know,
if I really think about it,

52:15.967 --> 52:19.008
I don't think I've ever been
in a room more amazing.

52:20.217 --> 52:21.717
- It's true.
- Yeah.

52:21.800 --> 52:23.842
This room is
the most amazing place

52:23.925 --> 52:25.217
I've ever been in,
in my entire life.

52:25.300 --> 52:26.800
It's the most
amazing place, right?

52:26.883 --> 52:30.258
So let's stay. We shouldn't go.

52:30.342 --> 52:32.758
- I really don't want to.
- So, let's not.

52:32.842 --> 52:33.842
- Okay.
- Okay.

52:33.925 --> 52:35.050
Let's just stay here.

52:35.133 --> 52:36.675
Let's just stay here.

52:37.300 --> 52:38.800
Forever.

52:41.883 --> 52:43.050
Although...

52:43.133 --> 52:45.883
I should probably go
and figure out

52:45.967 --> 52:50.967
how a stone brought my boyfriend
back in someone else's body.

52:55.175 --> 52:57.550
That's a fair point. Let's go.

53:40.175 --> 53:41.342
Whoa.

53:55.467 --> 53:56.633
Mr. Stagg?

53:56.717 --> 53:58.633
Thank you, Belinda.

53:59.467 --> 54:00.550
Oh, God.

54:01.633 --> 54:03.758
You'd better be here
with my money.

54:03.842 --> 54:06.967
I'll have your money, Simon.
Today, I'm here for an apology.

54:07.050 --> 54:09.633
Are you out of your mind?
I'm not going to apologize.

54:09.717 --> 54:10.925
I'm sorry.

54:11.008 --> 54:13.925
I messed up. I messed up.

54:14.008 --> 54:15.508
I lied.

54:16.842 --> 54:18.592
And I'm sorry.

54:18.675 --> 54:21.842
You know, the truth is, I knew we
were going to sink a long time ago.

54:21.925 --> 54:24.008
The wells were coming up dry.

54:24.092 --> 54:27.675
And no data suggested
that was going to change.

54:27.758 --> 54:29.383
I should have folded then.

54:29.467 --> 54:32.633
But all the people that bought
in, that believed in me.

54:32.717 --> 54:35.008
- I wanted to do right.
- Oh, come on.

54:35.092 --> 54:36.842
Max, look, you don't have to...

54:36.925 --> 54:40.758
Simon, don't you understand
that I wished for better?

54:40.842 --> 54:43.342
That with every ounce
of my being,

54:43.425 --> 54:47.800
I wished that Black Gold would
change the world for all of us.

54:49.592 --> 54:51.175
And I know
you wished that, too.

54:51.258 --> 54:54.050
Of course I wished that, too.

54:57.883 --> 54:59.758
Then your wish is granted.

54:59.842 --> 55:02.633
And in return,
I'll take all of your shares...

55:04.675 --> 55:06.592
and full control of Black Gold,

55:06.675 --> 55:09.717
after you are somehow magically
removed from my path...

55:09.800 --> 55:12.092
- You're gonna what?
- ...forever.

55:14.508 --> 55:16.383
Max!

55:16.467 --> 55:18.050
Hey, Max!

55:19.508 --> 55:22.717
- Get back here! Max!
- Ow.

55:22.800 --> 55:26.008
What the hell is going on?

55:31.842 --> 55:33.217
We have a warrant
for Simon Stagg.

55:33.300 --> 55:34.800
My word. Are we in danger?

55:34.883 --> 55:36.842
No, sir.
Federal taxation crime.

55:36.925 --> 55:38.758
It doesn't concern you.
Move along.

55:39.675 --> 55:41.008
Send them through.

55:41.092 --> 55:43.133
- Okay. Follow me.
- Let's go, guys.

55:55.467 --> 55:56.675
Ooh.

55:58.967 --> 56:02.383
So you said a stone
started all of this?

56:02.467 --> 56:04.758
Yeah, that's what we need
to go and find out.

56:04.842 --> 56:07.342
I mean, it must have
done something.

56:07.425 --> 56:10.383
This is dynamite.

56:10.467 --> 56:11.550
What do you think?

56:11.633 --> 56:13.925
- Yeah. Yeah...
- Huh? Right?

56:14.008 --> 56:17.300
I saw a couple of magazine pictures.
They roll these up.

56:17.383 --> 56:19.175
I think we can do better.

56:19.258 --> 56:21.800
Look at all the pockets in this.
There are pockets here.

56:21.883 --> 56:23.258
There are pockets
all over the pant.

56:23.342 --> 56:26.967
American issue bag, adjustable.

56:27.050 --> 56:28.675
Parachute pants?

56:28.758 --> 56:31.467
- Yeah. Uh...
- Does everybody parachute now?

56:31.550 --> 56:33.133
<i>You know,
I'm not so keen on this one.</i>

56:33.217 --> 56:36.675
I figure you are, but you know
what, I'm ready to go.

56:36.758 --> 56:37.717
Mmm-mmm.

56:37.800 --> 56:40.217
- Right?
- No.

56:40.300 --> 56:42.758
- You're not even giving it a second.
- It's not good.

56:42.842 --> 56:45.508
"Too much" in a good way
or a bad way? Right?

56:45.592 --> 56:47.258
- In a bad way.
- Oh.

56:49.342 --> 56:50.550
Now that's great.

56:50.633 --> 56:52.508
It's beautiful.

56:52.592 --> 56:55.133
Yeah. I would absolutely
never wear it.

56:55.217 --> 56:56.967
- I feel like a pirate.
- Steve.

56:57.050 --> 56:59.800
Who would wear this?

56:59.883 --> 57:01.008
Diana,

57:01.092 --> 57:02.550
have you seen these shoes?

57:02.633 --> 57:05.008
- Let's keep the shoes.
- Let's keep the shoes. Yes!

57:05.092 --> 57:06.342
- Let's keep the shoes.
- Yes!

57:15.883 --> 57:18.383
This is a special one, okay?

57:18.467 --> 57:20.675
- Let's do this together.
- Uh-huh.

57:22.342 --> 57:24.842
One foot after the other.

57:24.925 --> 57:26.800
Now stay on this one.

57:26.883 --> 57:28.675
Go to the middle.

57:28.758 --> 57:30.675
No, Steve...

57:30.758 --> 57:32.717
Steve, you're gonna fall.

57:38.383 --> 57:40.967
I really thought
I was gonna fall.

57:56.175 --> 57:57.967
What's up?

58:18.633 --> 58:20.633
This is break dance.

58:20.717 --> 58:22.383
- Dancing?
- Yeah.

58:27.633 --> 58:28.925
- Whoa!
- Oh, don't worry.

58:29.008 --> 58:30.217
- It's fine. It's just a move.
- Yeah? Oh.

58:30.300 --> 58:31.425
It's nothing.

58:36.592 --> 58:38.883
It's all art.

58:41.675 --> 58:42.758
Yeah.

58:47.508 --> 58:49.175
Uh... That's just a trash can.

58:49.258 --> 58:51.258
It's just a trash can.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

58:54.925 --> 58:57.633
Is that a plane?

58:57.717 --> 59:00.467
Come on.
I want to show you something.

59:20.258 --> 59:22.800
This is incredible!

59:36.842 --> 59:39.300
<i>And every time we strike gold,</i>

59:39.383 --> 59:41.467
<i>you strike gold.</i>

59:41.550 --> 59:46.300
<i>Think about finally having
everything you've always wished for.</i>

59:46.383 --> 59:48.717
Raquel?

59:50.050 --> 59:52.383
Raquel?

59:54.467 --> 59:57.508
Black Gold. Can you hold, please?

59:59.467 --> 01:00:02.508
Black Gold. Yes. Hold, please.

01:00:02.592 --> 01:00:04.133
- Raquel?
- Hold, please.

01:00:04.217 --> 01:00:05.383
The wells struck pay!

01:00:05.467 --> 01:00:06.842
- Which ones?
- All of them.

01:00:06.925 --> 01:00:08.883
And the investors
heard about it somehow.

01:00:08.967 --> 01:00:11.383
They're calling to up their buys.
Their friends are calling to buy in.

01:00:11.467 --> 01:00:13.550
New investors are calling
out of thin air.

01:00:13.633 --> 01:00:15.342
Hold on, please.
I need more help.

01:00:15.425 --> 01:00:18.217
- Black Gold. Can you hold, please?
- I'll get you help.

01:00:20.425 --> 01:00:22.717
Tell me again.
You wish you had more help?

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:24.467
Yes, I wish I had more help.

01:00:24.550 --> 01:00:26.133
There are just
too many calls to take.

01:00:26.217 --> 01:00:27.800
Uh... Hi.

01:00:27.883 --> 01:00:29.342
I'm sorry to bother you.

01:00:29.425 --> 01:00:31.300
I'm meant to be interviewing
at an accounting firm.

01:00:31.383 --> 01:00:32.717
- You're hired!
- Oh...

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:33.883
Welcome aboard!

01:00:33.967 --> 01:00:35.550
- Emerson.
- Emerson!

01:00:35.633 --> 01:00:37.217
Is this the employment office?

01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:38.633
Yes! You're hired, too!

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:41.967
Mr. Lord,
it's <i>Wall Street Journal.</i>

01:00:42.050 --> 01:00:45.342
They want to interview you
about company's sudden surge.

01:00:46.550 --> 01:00:48.883
I'll take it in my office.

01:00:50.092 --> 01:00:53.550
And bring me my vitamins.

01:00:53.633 --> 01:00:55.550
So I did read
about four books last night...

01:00:57.717 --> 01:00:58.967
...to try to get to the bottom of this.
And did find out, Roger, you were right.

01:00:59.050 --> 01:01:00.383
This is from the Song Dynasty.

01:01:00.467 --> 01:01:01.550
You were correct.

01:01:01.633 --> 01:01:03.383
And also interesting,

01:01:03.467 --> 01:01:05.217
I was looking at a couple of
encyclopedias last night and you...

01:01:06.425 --> 01:01:07.842
Thanks. Um...

01:01:10.425 --> 01:01:13.425
So funny, all this reading seems
to have cured my eyesight somehow.

01:01:15.133 --> 01:01:17.008
- Interesting fact which we...
- Hey.

01:01:17.092 --> 01:01:18.967
- Hi.
- Good morning.

01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:21.550
This is Steve. He's my, um...

01:01:21.633 --> 01:01:22.592
- Old friend.
- Yeah.

01:01:22.675 --> 01:01:25.092
Hi, old friend Steve.

01:01:25.175 --> 01:01:27.258
I'm Barbara,
Diana's new friend.

01:01:27.342 --> 01:01:28.758
So what do you do?

01:01:28.842 --> 01:01:30.467
I'm a pilot.

01:01:30.550 --> 01:01:32.217
- Pilot? Isn't that...
- Can I speak to you for a second?

01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:33.508
Sure.

01:01:36.258 --> 01:01:40.008
So, I just wanted to speak
to you about that stone.

01:01:40.092 --> 01:01:41.467
The citrine one.

01:01:42.592 --> 01:01:44.258
- Do you have it?
- Uh...

01:01:44.342 --> 01:01:47.800
Long story, actually,
about that.

01:01:47.883 --> 01:01:51.175
Max Lord came by
to visit yesterday.

01:01:51.258 --> 01:01:53.592
Which was actually
pretty great.

01:01:53.675 --> 01:01:55.800
I'll tell you
about it later. Um...

01:01:55.883 --> 01:01:58.300
I let him

01:01:58.800 --> 01:01:59.800
borrow it.

01:01:59.883 --> 01:02:01.092
What? Why?

01:02:01.175 --> 01:02:02.425
Well, Diana,

01:02:02.508 --> 01:02:03.925
he just gave us
a huge amount of money.

01:02:04.008 --> 01:02:05.717
It's not like he's a stranger
or anything.

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:07.383
Plus he has a friend who's an
expert, and I don't know...

01:02:07.467 --> 01:02:09.300
What do you mean?
How could you loan it?

01:02:09.383 --> 01:02:11.217
- It's not even ours to loan.
- Whoa. Whoa.

01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:13.383
What are you getting
on my case for?

01:02:13.467 --> 01:02:17.050
I've got 15 things in my office
more valuable than that stone.

01:02:17.133 --> 01:02:18.883
Do you know where he took it?

01:02:18.967 --> 01:02:21.383
No, I have no idea.

01:02:21.467 --> 01:02:23.300
Then I'll tell you
what we find out.

01:02:23.383 --> 01:02:24.633
Let's go.

01:02:24.717 --> 01:02:26.800
- I like your pants very much.
- Oh, thanks.

01:02:26.883 --> 01:02:28.258
Yeah. Call me.

01:02:28.342 --> 01:02:30.633
Or not. Whatever.

01:02:30.717 --> 01:02:32.967
But I'd be curious.

01:02:38.925 --> 01:02:41.633
<i>Call the Black Gold hotline.</i>

01:02:41.717 --> 01:02:44.467
<i>Shares are not available
in the building.</i>

01:02:47.967 --> 01:02:49.092
What are these people doing?

01:02:49.175 --> 01:02:50.383
Whatever it is,

01:02:50.467 --> 01:02:52.425
we're not getting in that way.

01:02:54.258 --> 01:02:57.467
Diana. Diana, this way.

01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:07.925
Have at it.

01:03:22.508 --> 01:03:23.800
Strong lock.

01:03:38.675 --> 01:03:39.925
Steve.

01:03:56.175 --> 01:03:59.050
- It's so dusty.
- Yeah.

01:04:00.175 --> 01:04:02.300
It's like a bomb went off.

01:04:14.008 --> 01:04:16.842
Whatever this is,
he's been looking for it for a long time.

01:04:29.092 --> 01:04:32.967
"Place upon
the object held."

01:04:35.842 --> 01:04:37.758
What is it?

01:04:37.842 --> 01:04:40.467
The language of the Gods.

01:04:40.550 --> 01:04:43.342
Which God wrote it,
is the question.

01:04:46.217 --> 01:04:47.467
Thanks.

01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:49.133
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah. It's okay.

01:04:49.217 --> 01:04:51.342
I gotta go do something. Okay.
I'll talk to you. All right?

01:04:51.425 --> 01:04:53.758
- Hello?
- <i>Barbara, I need your help.</i>

01:04:53.842 --> 01:04:55.925
<i>I need you to find out</i>

01:04:56.008 --> 01:04:58.633
exactly where
that stone was found.

01:04:58.717 --> 01:05:00.967
"Where" is what I need to know.
You understand?

01:05:01.050 --> 01:05:03.258
<i>Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'm on it.</i>

01:05:03.342 --> 01:05:05.008
Thanks.

01:05:07.342 --> 01:05:09.342
You look like you saw a ghost.

01:05:10.925 --> 01:05:12.633
I did.

01:05:15.383 --> 01:05:17.883
There were many Gods

01:05:17.967 --> 01:05:20.675
and they did different things
for different reasons.

01:05:20.758 --> 01:05:24.842
One was making
objects like this.

01:05:24.925 --> 01:05:27.217
There are universal elements
in this world,

01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:30.300
and when they're imbued
into something,

01:05:30.383 --> 01:05:34.800
they can become
very, very powerful.

01:05:35.758 --> 01:05:37.633
Like my Lasso of Truth.

01:05:37.717 --> 01:05:40.008
The truth is what powers it,
not me.

01:05:40.092 --> 01:05:43.175
The truth is bigger
than all of us.

01:05:43.258 --> 01:05:45.133
But what is this?

01:05:46.758 --> 01:05:48.383
I don't know. Uh...

01:05:50.133 --> 01:05:52.050
Brought me back.

01:05:53.592 --> 01:05:57.508
Love or hope...

01:05:58.217 --> 01:05:59.967
maybe?

01:06:00.050 --> 01:06:03.508
Maybe.

01:06:03.592 --> 01:06:08.425
Well, whatever it is, I can promise you
this is too powerful for Maxwell Lord.

01:06:08.508 --> 01:06:10.300
We need to find this guy.

01:06:10.383 --> 01:06:12.300
Uh...

01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:21.592
Look at this.

01:06:21.675 --> 01:06:24.092
If this date's right,
he's going to Cairo.

01:06:25.008 --> 01:06:27.092
Cairo?

01:06:27.175 --> 01:06:30.383
Yeah.
Growth opportunity, you know?

01:06:30.467 --> 01:06:32.925
"King of Crude"?

01:06:33.008 --> 01:06:35.008
How is this so fast?

01:06:36.633 --> 01:06:38.467
You have a plane that can fly

01:06:38.550 --> 01:06:40.008
from here to Cairo in one shot?

01:06:40.092 --> 01:06:41.925
That is amazing.

01:06:42.008 --> 01:06:44.592
Yeah, but we can't get you on one
because you don't have a passport.

01:06:44.675 --> 01:06:46.175
I don't want to get on one,

01:06:46.258 --> 01:06:48.050
I want to fly one.
I want to fly the plane.

01:06:48.133 --> 01:06:49.633
I want to fly this plane.

01:06:50.717 --> 01:06:51.883
Yeah?

01:07:17.258 --> 01:07:19.633
Oh, my Betsy.

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:26.633
Hey, Steve, this way.

01:07:26.717 --> 01:07:28.467
Yeah.

01:07:28.550 --> 01:07:31.800
Look at these gams.

01:07:41.175 --> 01:07:42.717
You wanna choose?

01:07:45.550 --> 01:07:46.800
This one.

01:07:47.508 --> 01:07:48.967
I like it.

01:07:59.967 --> 01:08:01.425
Okay.

01:08:04.258 --> 01:08:07.258
Okay. Uh...

01:08:08.717 --> 01:08:10.050
No.

01:08:10.133 --> 01:08:11.883
Uh...

01:08:13.008 --> 01:08:14.425
All right. Good, good.

01:08:14.508 --> 01:08:16.550
Fuel, fuel, fuel.

01:08:16.633 --> 01:08:18.216
Here we go. Engine.

01:08:20.258 --> 01:08:21.591
Here goes nothing.

01:08:24.841 --> 01:08:26.008
Oh...

01:08:38.091 --> 01:08:39.300
- Ken?
- What?

01:08:39.383 --> 01:08:41.050
There's an aircraft
on the runway.

01:08:41.133 --> 01:08:42.550
What do you mean,
"There's an aircraft on the runway"?

01:08:42.633 --> 01:08:43.925
Approach, this is Tower.

01:08:44.008 --> 01:08:45.341
There's an unlisted aircraft
on the runway.

01:08:45.425 --> 01:08:46.675
Are you seeing this?

01:08:50.841 --> 01:08:52.508
- Can you get us up there?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:08:52.591 --> 01:08:54.091
I just have to pick up
speed first,

01:08:54.175 --> 01:08:55.758
and then I'll take off.

01:08:55.841 --> 01:08:58.758
The way I fly,
they will never find us.

01:09:03.133 --> 01:09:05.258
- Oh, I forgot to tell you.
- What?

01:09:05.341 --> 01:09:06.716
Radar. I can't explain now,

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:09.008
but they'll see us anywhere,
even in the dark.

01:09:09.091 --> 01:09:11.841
Well, will they shoot at us?

01:09:12.966 --> 01:09:15.133
- Well, shit, Diana.
- Right.

01:09:21.633 --> 01:09:23.841
- Diana.
- Wait. Shh! I know.

01:09:23.925 --> 01:09:27.050
I know. Focus.

01:09:27.133 --> 01:09:28.966
Focus.

01:09:29.050 --> 01:09:31.175
My father hid Themyscira
from the world,

01:09:31.258 --> 01:09:33.508
and I've been trying to learn
how he did it.

01:09:33.591 --> 01:09:34.675
Did what?

01:09:34.758 --> 01:09:36.633
Made something invisible.

01:09:36.716 --> 01:09:38.883
But in 50 years,
I've only done it once.

01:09:38.966 --> 01:09:40.508
Well, now's not a bad time
to start trying.

01:09:40.591 --> 01:09:42.716
- How long does it last?
- I don't know.

01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:45.341
It was just a coffee cup...

01:09:45.425 --> 01:09:47.050
and I lost it.

01:10:12.675 --> 01:10:13.633
Approach,

01:10:13.717 --> 01:10:14.842
the aircraft has vanished.

01:10:14.925 --> 01:10:16.092
Do you have eyes on it?

01:10:44.342 --> 01:10:46.633
An invisible jet.

01:11:09.842 --> 01:11:11.300
What's that?

01:11:13.592 --> 01:11:14.550
Oh, it's okay.

01:11:14.633 --> 01:11:16.592
It's just fireworks.

01:11:16.675 --> 01:11:19.342
The Fourth. Of course.

01:11:19.425 --> 01:11:20.925
The Fourth of July?

01:12:01.383 --> 01:12:02.550
Wow.

01:12:14.133 --> 01:12:15.717
I got an idea.

01:12:51.550 --> 01:12:53.842
You know, it's the one thing.

01:12:53.925 --> 01:12:56.217
The one thing
that's always been you to me.

01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:57.217
What?

01:12:57.300 --> 01:12:58.383
Flight.

01:12:58.467 --> 01:13:00.133
Your gift.

01:13:00.217 --> 01:13:02.717
I'll never understand it.

01:13:03.467 --> 01:13:05.008
Ah, it's...

01:13:06.425 --> 01:13:08.675
It's so easy, really.

01:13:08.758 --> 01:13:11.800
It's wind and air

01:13:11.883 --> 01:13:15.967
and knowing how to ride it,
how to catch it.

01:13:17.383 --> 01:13:19.008
How to join with it.

01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:22.008
Yeah.

01:13:22.092 --> 01:13:24.675
It's like anything, really.

01:13:49.258 --> 01:13:51.175
Great, thanks.

01:13:51.258 --> 01:13:54.425
Found the last one.

01:13:54.508 --> 01:13:56.508
This should keep you busy
for a while.

01:13:58.050 --> 01:14:01.675
Anything else I can get you?
Coffee?

01:14:02.092 --> 01:14:03.675
Tea?

01:14:03.758 --> 01:14:05.717
Me?

01:14:07.133 --> 01:14:09.967
I don't need anything from you,
and I'm done.

01:14:10.050 --> 01:14:11.842
You're done?

01:14:11.925 --> 01:14:14.842
Hey, you don't have
to be mean about it.

01:14:21.717 --> 01:14:23.842
Hey, babe.
Where you going?

01:14:23.925 --> 01:14:25.633
No thanks.

01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:31.592
Ooh, you're pretty.

01:14:31.675 --> 01:14:33.758
Hey, slow down, sexy.

01:14:38.925 --> 01:14:40.217
You talking to me?

01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:42.342
Yep. I'm talking to you.

01:14:43.508 --> 01:14:46.842
Why don't you just
slow down a bit, huh?

01:14:46.925 --> 01:14:48.842
Come on, girl.

01:14:48.925 --> 01:14:51.675
I'd rather not.
You know what I mean?

01:14:54.008 --> 01:14:56.383
I'd rather not have anything
to do with someone like you.

01:14:56.467 --> 01:14:59.092
I'd rather you stop
harassing people.

01:15:00.550 --> 01:15:02.883
Like me.

01:15:02.967 --> 01:15:04.258
Do you remember me?

01:15:06.133 --> 01:15:08.758
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:15:08.842 --> 01:15:12.092
I remember.
Where were we, huh?

01:15:15.008 --> 01:15:16.175
No.

01:15:20.258 --> 01:15:21.425
No.

01:15:27.967 --> 01:15:28.967
No.

01:15:31.258 --> 01:15:32.342
She's right.

01:15:32.425 --> 01:15:34.717
It's not that hard.

01:15:40.008 --> 01:15:43.008
Yeah, I think I get it now.

01:15:44.300 --> 01:15:46.342
His body weight
does do all the work.

01:15:50.508 --> 01:15:52.092
So easy.

01:15:54.050 --> 01:15:55.342
I think

01:15:55.425 --> 01:15:56.967
I could do this...

01:15:59.508 --> 01:16:01.675
all...

01:16:03.175 --> 01:16:04.383
night...

01:16:05.883 --> 01:16:07.842
long!

01:16:25.300 --> 01:16:26.883
Barbara?

01:16:30.342 --> 01:16:32.217
What are you doing?

01:16:34.592 --> 01:16:36.967
Mind your business.

01:16:44.717 --> 01:16:46.092
Sir?

01:16:53.675 --> 01:16:58.592
Your fortune the last few days
has been impressive, to say the least.

01:16:58.675 --> 01:17:02.258
But why come all this way
to meet with me? Hmm?

01:17:03.342 --> 01:17:05.008
To meet a peer.

01:17:05.092 --> 01:17:06.842
A peer?

01:17:06.925 --> 01:17:10.550
No, Mr. Lord. I only agreed to meet
with you because I was curious.

01:17:10.633 --> 01:17:13.800
No one gets that lucky.
How did you do it?

01:17:16.425 --> 01:17:20.300
On my journey
to self-fulfillment...

01:17:20.383 --> 01:17:22.675
I lucked into a secret.

01:17:22.758 --> 01:17:24.925
The secret of the wish.

01:17:25.758 --> 01:17:27.008
So I wished for it.

01:17:27.092 --> 01:17:30.508
Or someone
wished for it for me.

01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:34.425
Tell me what you wish for,
Your Highness,

01:17:34.508 --> 01:17:37.050
and I will show you
how it works.

01:17:38.467 --> 01:17:41.133
I wish for things
one cannot attain.

01:17:41.217 --> 01:17:42.758
Like what?

01:17:44.758 --> 01:17:47.175
All of my land to be returned.

01:17:47.258 --> 01:17:48.967
My ancestral realm.

01:17:49.050 --> 01:17:51.342
The Bialyian Dynasty.

01:17:51.425 --> 01:17:54.300
And for all the heathens
who dare trod upon it

01:17:54.383 --> 01:17:59.592
to be kept out forever,
so that its glory may be renewed.

01:17:59.675 --> 01:18:01.633
You wish for that?

01:18:01.717 --> 01:18:04.592
I wish for that deeply.

01:18:09.842 --> 01:18:12.133
Your wish is granted.

01:18:12.217 --> 01:18:15.425
And in return,
I will take your oil.

01:18:21.550 --> 01:18:23.758
You truly delight me.

01:18:23.842 --> 01:18:26.092
You know so little.

01:18:26.175 --> 01:18:29.425
I sold my oil to the Saudis.

01:18:29.508 --> 01:18:30.925
You are a silly man.

01:18:39.508 --> 01:18:41.550
Then I will take
your security team

01:18:41.633 --> 01:18:43.508
and leave you here
with nothing to defend yourself

01:18:43.592 --> 01:18:47.258
against the wrath you most
certainly will face.

01:19:27.425 --> 01:19:30.425
Stop! Stop the car!

01:19:30.508 --> 01:19:31.800
What are you doing?

01:19:31.883 --> 01:19:34.175
Stop what you're doing now!
I'm telling you.

01:19:34.258 --> 01:19:36.133
I command you to stop!

01:19:37.092 --> 01:19:38.175
Stop!

01:19:38.258 --> 01:19:40.508
Stop! Stop!

01:19:42.508 --> 01:19:45.342
<i>This
unbelievable and unexplainable wall</i>

01:19:45.425 --> 01:19:47.050
<i>appears to somehow be the work</i>

01:19:47.133 --> 01:19:49.050
<i>of Emir Said Bin Abydos.</i>

01:19:49.133 --> 01:19:51.842
<i>The government is reporting
old rulings have emerged</i>

01:19:51.925 --> 01:19:54.175
<i>acknowledging his claim
to the land.</i>

01:20:05.133 --> 01:20:06.675
You okay?

01:20:06.758 --> 01:20:09.175
I'm fine.

01:20:09.258 --> 01:20:13.050
You keep saying that, but...

01:20:15.217 --> 01:20:16.300
That was him!

01:20:16.383 --> 01:20:18.467
That was Max Lord.

01:20:46.508 --> 01:20:48.633
Get rid of them, please.

01:21:24.383 --> 01:21:25.467
I got this.

01:21:25.550 --> 01:21:26.508
What?

01:21:27.758 --> 01:21:29.008
Diana!

01:21:42.925 --> 01:21:44.717
The brakes still work.

01:23:59.383 --> 01:24:00.925
Max Lord,

01:24:01.008 --> 01:24:04.342
you're putting yourself and
everyone else in grave danger.

01:24:04.425 --> 01:24:06.300
I need you
to give me the stone.

01:24:06.383 --> 01:24:08.467
What happened to it?

01:24:08.550 --> 01:24:10.508
You're looking at it.

01:24:16.717 --> 01:24:17.883
Whoa!

01:25:08.842 --> 01:25:10.383
Steve!

01:25:10.967 --> 01:25:11.925
Diana!

01:26:11.842 --> 01:26:14.467
So who's the next
closest person with oil?

01:26:34.217 --> 01:26:37.467
Diana. Diana.

01:26:37.550 --> 01:26:42.508
My God.
What's going on with you?

01:26:42.592 --> 01:26:45.258
<i>A truly bizarre phenomenon
that is being called the Divine Wall.</i>

01:26:45.342 --> 01:26:46.842
What is happening?

01:26:46.925 --> 01:26:48.467
<i>It's an unexplainable event</i>

01:26:48.550 --> 01:26:50.425
<i>that now sees
Egypt's poorest communities</i>

01:26:50.508 --> 01:26:52.842
<i>entirely cut off from their
only supply of fresh water.</i>

01:26:52.925 --> 01:26:55.717
<i>An already
tense situation now escalating</i>

01:26:55.800 --> 01:27:00.050
<i>as the Soviet Union announces they
will recognize the Emir's claim.</i>

01:27:00.133 --> 01:27:01.675
- Oh, no.
- <i>The United States,</i>

01:27:01.758 --> 01:27:04.133
<i>a longtime ally of Egypt,
has declared</i>

01:27:04.217 --> 01:27:06.842
<i>their intention to side
with the government.</i>

01:27:06.925 --> 01:27:09.217
<i>Bedlam on the home front
now as well</i>

01:27:09.300 --> 01:27:11.800
<i>as the shocking news
that American businessman</i>

01:27:11.883 --> 01:27:14.633
<i>Max Lord has somehow
come into possession</i>

01:27:14.717 --> 01:27:17.092
<i>of over half
of the world's oil reserves.</i>

01:27:17.175 --> 01:27:20.300
<i>The instability in the
oil community has resulted</i>

01:27:20.383 --> 01:27:22.258
<i>in a nationwide run on gas,</i>

01:27:22.342 --> 01:27:24.300
<i>and experts are girding themselves...</i>

01:27:24.383 --> 01:27:25.383
Hello?

01:27:25.467 --> 01:27:26.800
Barbara, it's Diana.

01:27:26.883 --> 01:27:30.175
- Did you...
- <i>Yeah. Uh, well, sort of.</i>

01:27:30.258 --> 01:27:32.800
<i>I haven't figured out
exactly what the stone is,</i>

01:27:32.883 --> 01:27:35.800
<i>but I've found
historical images of it.</i>

01:27:35.883 --> 01:27:36.800
From where?

01:27:36.883 --> 01:27:38.342
That's the weird thing.

01:27:38.425 --> 01:27:40.092
From everywhere.

01:27:40.175 --> 01:27:43.633
It first appeared in the Indus
Valley almost 4,000 years ago.

01:27:43.717 --> 01:27:46.425
It popped up again
in Carthage in 146 BC.

01:27:46.508 --> 01:27:48.342
Kush, 4 AD.

01:27:48.425 --> 01:27:50.342
Romulus, the last
Emperor of Rome,

01:27:50.425 --> 01:27:53.425
he had it on him when
he was assassinated in 476.

01:27:53.508 --> 01:27:57.508
<i>The last record is in some
previously unknown dead city</i>

01:27:57.592 --> 01:27:59.008
<i>near Dzibilchaltun.</i>

01:27:59.092 --> 01:28:00.842
- The Mayans.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

01:28:00.925 --> 01:28:03.050
Anyway, it just led me
to a bunch of dead ends,

01:28:03.133 --> 01:28:06.800
and my last lead
is not that promising.

01:28:06.883 --> 01:28:08.050
What's that?

01:28:08.133 --> 01:28:09.800
<i>A flier I found.</i>

01:28:09.883 --> 01:28:11.675
Grabbed it at the embassy.

01:28:11.758 --> 01:28:14.592
Some guy advertising
to be a Mayan shaman.

01:28:14.675 --> 01:28:18.217
But he literally teaches a course
in a squat next to Galaxy Records.

01:28:18.300 --> 01:28:21.050
- And he knows about the stone?
- <i>So he says.</i>

01:28:21.133 --> 01:28:23.258
I'm gonna go there
in the morning.

01:28:23.342 --> 01:28:27.050
Okay, we'll meet you there.
And thank you.

01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:31.675
What is it?

01:28:33.508 --> 01:28:34.883
The stone has
traveled the world

01:28:34.967 --> 01:28:36.717
to seemingly random
and different places,

01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:39.217
- but they all have one thing in common.
- What?

01:28:39.300 --> 01:28:42.342
Their civilizations collapsed
catastrophically.

01:28:42.425 --> 01:28:44.717
Without a trace as to why.

01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:46.592
You don't think
the stone could have...

01:28:47.258 --> 01:28:48.633
Do you?

01:28:48.717 --> 01:28:50.925
I don't know
what to think, Steve.

01:28:51.842 --> 01:28:54.758
I can only hope I'm wrong.

01:29:22.508 --> 01:29:24.717
Babajide?

01:29:29.842 --> 01:29:31.925
- That was fast.
- Morning.

01:29:34.008 --> 01:29:35.508
Hello.

01:29:37.008 --> 01:29:39.133
One second.

01:29:41.175 --> 01:29:43.175
So you're a Mayan?

01:29:43.258 --> 01:29:45.675
What? I'm a citizen
of the world.

01:29:45.758 --> 01:29:47.133
It says your name is Frank.

01:29:47.217 --> 01:29:50.467
Yeah. Most of what I know
is a past-life thing.

01:29:50.550 --> 01:29:51.800
So that's a no.

01:29:51.883 --> 01:29:54.217
But to answer
your question, yes.

01:29:54.300 --> 01:29:57.508
My great-great-grandfather

01:29:57.592 --> 01:29:59.175
left me this.

01:29:59.258 --> 01:30:02.342
I don't know everything about
it, but I have been warned

01:30:02.425 --> 01:30:03.883
I'm better off that way.

01:30:03.967 --> 01:30:07.550
What I do know is,
it destroyed our people

01:30:07.633 --> 01:30:08.967
in a matter of months.

01:30:09.050 --> 01:30:11.633
The few survivors,
they buried the stone,

01:30:11.717 --> 01:30:14.800
never to be exhumed
under any circumstances.

01:30:14.883 --> 01:30:17.633
- Can I see that?
- Be my guest.

01:30:32.008 --> 01:30:33.425
What?

01:30:34.133 --> 01:30:35.175
What is it?

01:30:39.092 --> 01:30:40.842
<i>Dechalafrea Ero.</i>

01:30:40.925 --> 01:30:42.008
What's that?

01:30:42.092 --> 01:30:44.383
A very bad God.

01:30:44.467 --> 01:30:47.008
The God of Lies,
Dolos, Mendacius,

01:30:47.092 --> 01:30:49.342
Duke of Deception.
He's been called by many names.

01:30:49.425 --> 01:30:51.758
But if he's the one
who empowered that stone,

01:30:51.842 --> 01:30:53.217
there has to be a trick.

01:30:53.300 --> 01:30:55.258
What do lies have to do
with granting wishes?

01:30:55.342 --> 01:30:57.717
It seems more like
a Dreamstone to me.

01:30:58.758 --> 01:31:01.383
Wishes with a trick.

01:31:01.467 --> 01:31:03.925
"The Monkey's Paw."

01:31:04.008 --> 01:31:05.717
Beware what you wish for.

01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:09.133
It grants your wish,
but takes your most valued possession.

01:31:10.467 --> 01:31:12.300
Diana, your powers.

01:31:12.383 --> 01:31:13.842
No, that doesn't
make any sense.

01:31:13.925 --> 01:31:15.883
What's more precious
than what you wish for?

01:31:15.967 --> 01:31:17.175
How do we stop this?

01:31:17.258 --> 01:31:18.717
The legend said

01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:20.800
it can only be stopped
by destroying the stone itself

01:31:20.883 --> 01:31:22.800
or give back what was given.
My people couldn't do the first thing

01:31:22.883 --> 01:31:24.467
and refused to do the second.

01:31:25.425 --> 01:31:27.258
Now the culture's destroyed.

01:31:27.342 --> 01:31:29.217
Wiped from the face
of the Earth.

01:31:29.300 --> 01:31:32.258
- No one renounced their wish?
- But the stone is already destroyed.

01:31:32.342 --> 01:31:34.133
What? When?

01:31:36.300 --> 01:31:38.633
"You're looking at it."

01:31:38.717 --> 01:31:42.508
"You're looking at it." That's
what Max Lord said to me.

01:31:42.592 --> 01:31:44.300
Maybe it's him.

01:31:44.383 --> 01:31:46.300
He's become it somehow.

01:31:46.383 --> 01:31:48.258
But how would
that happen?

01:31:48.342 --> 01:31:50.758
I mean, if he wished for...

01:31:59.258 --> 01:32:02.175
No, that's crazy. No.

01:32:02.258 --> 01:32:04.425
If we destroy it,

01:32:04.508 --> 01:32:06.550
if we destroy him...

01:32:07.550 --> 01:32:08.800
all the wishes go back.

01:32:08.883 --> 01:32:10.467
What are you
talking about? No.

01:32:10.550 --> 01:32:12.342
I'm not gonna be
a part of that. No.

01:32:12.425 --> 01:32:14.258
Or if everyone
renounces their wish.

01:32:14.342 --> 01:32:17.758
No, there has to be
a better way.

01:32:17.842 --> 01:32:19.258
No.

01:32:22.842 --> 01:32:24.217
She's right.

01:32:24.300 --> 01:32:26.425
We don't know enough.
We just don't know enough.

01:32:26.508 --> 01:32:29.467
But what we do know is that we need
to stop him before he grants any more.

01:32:29.550 --> 01:32:33.300
Stopping him might
not be enough, Diana.

01:32:33.383 --> 01:32:34.967
Wishes have been made.

01:32:37.175 --> 01:32:38.550
Barbara?

01:32:40.008 --> 01:32:41.425
Barbara?

01:32:49.550 --> 01:32:52.133
Like I want any of
these people in the club anyway.

01:32:52.217 --> 01:32:53.717
Can we tell them
they're not invited?

01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:55.008
No, sir.

01:32:55.092 --> 01:32:56.925
- The FCC said we couldn't...
- Oh, the FCC.

01:32:57.008 --> 01:33:00.800
The BBB, the FBD.

01:33:00.883 --> 01:33:03.633
It's a conspiracy
against my success.

01:33:03.717 --> 01:33:05.800
They're jealous. That's why.
Who's next?

01:33:05.883 --> 01:33:08.592
- Who's next?
- Well, everyone you asked for,

01:33:08.675 --> 01:33:10.342
Lai Zhong, Mr. Khalaji,

01:33:10.425 --> 01:33:13.508
- that televangelist who stole your slot.
- Mmm.

01:33:13.592 --> 01:33:15.217
And you have Alistair
for the night.

01:33:15.300 --> 01:33:18.508
Alistair? Again?
How many weekends do I have?

01:33:18.592 --> 01:33:19.633
What? What? When?

01:33:19.717 --> 01:33:21.133
Tonight?

01:33:25.925 --> 01:33:27.092
He's here already.

01:33:27.175 --> 01:33:28.925
His mom is with her boyfriend.

01:33:34.425 --> 01:33:36.675
Send in Mr. Zhong, please.

01:33:36.758 --> 01:33:39.675
And buy Alistair a pony.

01:33:39.758 --> 01:33:42.217
No! A race car.
Get him a race car.

01:33:44.633 --> 01:33:46.717
Let's get to it, Lai.

01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:48.467
Tell me...

01:33:49.217 --> 01:33:50.758
what do you want?

01:33:51.883 --> 01:33:54.883
What do you wish for?

01:33:54.967 --> 01:33:57.050
- Me? Truly?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:33:57.133 --> 01:33:59.050
Mmm-hmm.

01:33:59.133 --> 01:34:01.883
The Soviets have sided
with Iran.

01:34:01.967 --> 01:34:05.258
Iraq is preparing to defend
ourselves, as unrest spreads.

01:34:05.342 --> 01:34:08.383
And you need? What do you...

01:34:08.467 --> 01:34:10.383
What do you wish for?

01:34:10.467 --> 01:34:12.675
Consider the sex tape gone.

01:34:12.758 --> 01:34:14.758
And God darn it,
if I have to keep doing this

01:34:14.842 --> 01:34:17.800
one by one, by one, by one...

01:34:17.883 --> 01:34:19.425
- How's your health?
- Well...

01:34:19.508 --> 01:34:20.675
Forget that.

01:34:20.758 --> 01:34:22.842
But I will take
your entire congregation

01:34:22.925 --> 01:34:24.300
and your time slot.

01:34:24.383 --> 01:34:25.383
Let me ask you,

01:34:25.467 --> 01:34:27.550
when they pray,
is there any way

01:34:27.633 --> 01:34:30.883
I could get all of them to...

01:34:30.967 --> 01:34:32.258
join hands with me?

01:34:32.342 --> 01:34:34.050
And simply say, "I wish"

01:34:34.133 --> 01:34:36.133
rather than, "I pray"?

01:34:36.217 --> 01:34:37.592
Would that even work?

01:34:37.675 --> 01:34:38.592
I don't...

01:34:38.675 --> 01:34:40.008
I need to find a way

01:34:40.092 --> 01:34:42.925
to touch a lot of people
at the same time.

01:34:44.175 --> 01:34:45.925
Sir. The police are here.

01:34:46.008 --> 01:34:48.258
They're challenging the
jurisdiction of your security team.

01:34:48.342 --> 01:34:50.342
Oh, God!

01:34:50.425 --> 01:34:53.592
This isn't working.
Bring in someone new.

01:34:53.675 --> 01:34:54.842
And my son.

01:34:54.925 --> 01:34:56.925
You, beat it.

01:35:06.425 --> 01:35:08.217
Alistair!

01:35:10.258 --> 01:35:12.717
I've missed you, buddy.

01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:14.675
Come. Sit down with Daddy.
I'm sorry.

01:35:16.342 --> 01:35:21.425
But, your dad is on the absolute
precipice of everything.

01:35:21.508 --> 01:35:23.842
Remember when I told you
that I would be number one?

01:35:23.925 --> 01:35:25.800
Do you remember? Your dad?

01:35:25.883 --> 01:35:28.092
Well, I'm inches away. Huh?

01:35:28.175 --> 01:35:30.133
I know it's hard. I know.

01:35:30.217 --> 01:35:31.633
But listen,

01:35:31.717 --> 01:35:33.967
I also know what you wish for,
and I wish for it, too.

01:35:34.050 --> 01:35:36.175
Do you hear that?
I wish for it, too.

01:35:36.258 --> 01:35:37.592
I just wish
I could be with you...

01:35:37.675 --> 01:35:39.258
No!

01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:43.508
You don't use your
one wish like that, Alistair.

01:35:43.592 --> 01:35:46.467
You don't wish for something
that you already have.

01:35:46.550 --> 01:35:49.217
You wish for greatness,
for success.

01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:51.508
That's why
I'm doing all of this.

01:35:51.592 --> 01:35:56.467
Don't you see that my greatness
is your greatness? Huh?

01:36:00.050 --> 01:36:01.925
Then I wish for your greatness.

01:36:02.008 --> 01:36:04.050
No. No!

01:36:16.883 --> 01:36:18.425
Thank you.

01:36:19.758 --> 01:36:21.842
I love you so much.

01:36:21.925 --> 01:36:23.800
And I promise you, one day,

01:36:23.883 --> 01:36:26.342
everything is going
to make sense.

01:36:26.425 --> 01:36:29.342
And one day, you'll thank me.

01:36:30.717 --> 01:36:33.425
But right now, I, uh...

01:36:33.508 --> 01:36:36.842
Right now, I need you to stay here
with Emerson, okay? I'll be back.

01:36:36.925 --> 01:36:39.175
You stay here.

01:36:50.133 --> 01:36:51.550
You. You.

01:36:51.633 --> 01:36:53.175
Yes, sir?

01:36:53.258 --> 01:36:55.508
Don't you wish I had an audience
with the President today?

01:36:55.592 --> 01:36:57.383
Of course I do.

01:36:57.467 --> 01:36:59.217
And can I tell you how happy I am
that you value my opinion, sir.

01:36:59.300 --> 01:37:01.633
Wait a minute.
Have I asked for your wish before?

01:37:01.717 --> 01:37:03.800
Yesterday. A Porsche.

01:37:03.883 --> 01:37:05.383
What is it with you aides
and Porsches?

01:37:05.925 --> 01:37:07.175
You!

01:37:07.258 --> 01:37:08.675
Hi.

01:37:08.758 --> 01:37:10.800
This way.

01:37:15.592 --> 01:37:16.592
How's traffic?

01:37:16.675 --> 01:37:18.342
Huh? Terrible.

01:37:18.425 --> 01:37:20.050
Don't you wish it wasn't?

01:37:20.133 --> 01:37:23.092
And that everywhere you went
parted like the great Red Sea?

01:37:23.175 --> 01:37:27.467
Of course I wish that.
Sadly, ain't gonna happen.

01:37:35.342 --> 01:37:36.675
Hey, you! Stop!

01:37:36.758 --> 01:37:39.008
Come on in. It's not safe.

01:37:39.092 --> 01:37:41.092
There's a riot
at the Saudi Embassy

01:37:41.175 --> 01:37:43.758
and there are Porsches
racing up and down the street.

01:37:43.842 --> 01:37:44.925
Come on. It's mad.

01:37:45.008 --> 01:37:47.925
But my cows.

01:37:48.008 --> 01:37:51.633
I told a man I wanted a farm.

01:37:51.717 --> 01:37:54.133
I didn't mean here.

01:37:58.550 --> 01:38:00.967
I'll be right back.

01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:01.675
Diana, I know it's been hard.

01:39:01.758 --> 01:39:04.008
You don't know. You don't.

01:39:04.092 --> 01:39:05.967
But we...

01:39:06.050 --> 01:39:07.467
It can't go on like this.

01:39:07.550 --> 01:39:09.717
- I can't talk about this.
- We have to talk about it.

01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:11.467
Steve, I can't talk about this!

01:39:17.092 --> 01:39:19.592
I give everything I have,
every day.

01:39:19.675 --> 01:39:21.550
And I'm happy to.

01:39:21.633 --> 01:39:25.050
But this one thing...

01:39:25.133 --> 01:39:29.800
You're all that I've wanted
for so long.

01:39:29.883 --> 01:39:33.550
You're the only joy I've had
or even asked for.

01:39:34.383 --> 01:39:36.092
I am so sorry...

01:39:38.133 --> 01:39:40.842
but that's crazy.

01:39:40.925 --> 01:39:44.842
There's a world
out there full of

01:39:44.925 --> 01:39:46.217
so many better guys, for one.

01:39:46.300 --> 01:39:48.550
I mean, how about this guy?
How about him?

01:39:48.633 --> 01:39:51.175
I don't want him. I want you.

01:39:51.258 --> 01:39:54.675
Why, for once, can't I just
have this one thing, Steve?

01:39:54.758 --> 01:39:56.425
This one thing.

01:39:59.300 --> 01:40:01.717
I'm not sure we have a choice.

01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:06.383
Well, I do have a choice.

01:40:06.467 --> 01:40:07.967
And I can't give you up.
I can't.

01:40:08.050 --> 01:40:10.425
So I won't.
So we need to stop him

01:40:10.508 --> 01:40:12.717
so we can figure that out.

01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:14.092
There has to be another way.

01:40:15.550 --> 01:40:17.092
Has to.

01:40:30.175 --> 01:40:31.258
Wow.

01:40:32.092 --> 01:40:35.217
This is incredible.

01:40:40.175 --> 01:40:41.300
What's that?

01:40:42.675 --> 01:40:44.383
From my culture.

01:40:44.467 --> 01:40:49.133
The armor of an ancient Amazon warrior.
One of our greatest.

01:40:49.217 --> 01:40:51.883
It's huge. This whole thing?

01:40:53.967 --> 01:40:55.300
What is it made out of?

01:40:55.383 --> 01:40:57.258
Here. Let me show you.

01:40:58.050 --> 01:40:59.883
Give me your hand.

01:40:59.967 --> 01:41:01.592
What are you talking about?
I haven't lied.

01:41:01.675 --> 01:41:04.300
The Lasso does more than
just make you tell the truth.

01:41:04.383 --> 01:41:06.508
It can make you see it, too.

01:41:12.300 --> 01:41:14.008
<i>Her name was Asteria.</i>

01:41:14.092 --> 01:41:15.967
<i>She was our greatest warrior.</i>

01:41:16.050 --> 01:41:20.467
<i>When mankind enslaved the
Amazons, my mother freed us.</i>

01:41:20.550 --> 01:41:23.592
<i>But someone had to stay behind
to hold back the tide of men</i>

01:41:23.675 --> 01:41:26.842
<i>so the others
could escape to Themyscira.</i>

01:41:26.925 --> 01:41:28.967
<i>My people gave up
all of their armor</i>

01:41:29.050 --> 01:41:34.300
<i>to make her one suit strong
enough to take on the whole world.</i>

01:41:34.383 --> 01:41:39.758
<i>And Asteria sacrificed herself
for a better day for others.</i>

01:41:43.675 --> 01:41:45.092
That's...

01:41:46.883 --> 01:41:48.008
That's incredible.

01:41:48.092 --> 01:41:51.133
When I came here,
I searched for her.

01:41:51.217 --> 01:41:54.633
But all I could find
was her armor.

01:41:54.717 --> 01:41:56.300
What is this?

01:41:57.508 --> 01:41:59.300
Where is he going?

01:41:59.383 --> 01:42:00.800
Oh, no.

01:42:20.508 --> 01:42:22.217
Diana, Diana!
What are you doing?

01:42:22.300 --> 01:42:23.967
- Where are you going?
- Steve, I'm going. You need to stay.

01:42:24.050 --> 01:42:26.050
No. No. Listen to me.

01:42:26.133 --> 01:42:27.425
You're getting weaker, Diana.

01:42:27.508 --> 01:42:28.758
- What if you fall?
- I won't.

01:42:28.842 --> 01:42:31.758
You might. We don't know that.

01:42:31.842 --> 01:42:34.217
There has to be another way in.

01:42:46.717 --> 01:42:48.758
Everything okay, Mr. President?

01:42:49.175 --> 01:42:50.258
Yes.

01:42:51.133 --> 01:42:53.467
Something very strange. I...

01:42:53.550 --> 01:42:57.175
I thought I was somewhere else entirely.
Suddenly...

01:42:58.508 --> 01:43:01.342
Anyway. Hectic times.

01:43:02.592 --> 01:43:04.883
Give us a minute.

01:43:10.675 --> 01:43:11.675
Excuse me.

01:43:15.133 --> 01:43:16.800
- Carl.
- Diana.

01:43:16.883 --> 01:43:18.592
- Hi.
- What a pleasure.

01:43:18.675 --> 01:43:20.800
Good to see you.
How have you been?

01:43:20.883 --> 01:43:22.175
- Good.
- This is Steve.

01:43:22.258 --> 01:43:23.925
Steve, this is Carl.
My colleague.

01:43:24.008 --> 01:43:26.383
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:43:26.467 --> 01:43:27.758
Shall we, uh...

01:43:27.842 --> 01:43:30.300
Yeah, we shall.

01:43:30.383 --> 01:43:31.925
I'm sorry, Mr. Lord.

01:43:32.008 --> 01:43:34.300
In fact, I don't even know
what we're supposed to discuss.

01:43:34.383 --> 01:43:35.633
Exactly that, Mr. President.

01:43:35.717 --> 01:43:39.633
These hectic days,
hectic times.

01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:42.092
And you.

01:43:42.175 --> 01:43:43.467
<i>These aren't
exactly my favorite</i>

01:43:43.550 --> 01:43:45.258
of the busts on display here,

01:43:45.342 --> 01:43:48.633
but it's a little picture of my top
ten, maybe top five at a push.

01:43:48.717 --> 01:43:50.925
Oh, here's something up ahead
that will interest you.

01:43:51.008 --> 01:43:55.883
These are floor tiles originally
laid by none other than Jan Lincoln,

01:43:55.967 --> 01:43:58.467
a little-known descendent
of Abraham.

01:43:58.550 --> 01:44:01.133
You're having some troubles?

01:44:01.217 --> 01:44:02.675
Everywhere suddenly.

01:44:02.758 --> 01:44:04.633
Cuba, Egypt,

01:44:04.717 --> 01:44:06.217
even here.

01:44:06.883 --> 01:44:08.383
But Russia...

01:44:08.467 --> 01:44:10.508
- very troublesome.
- Mmm.

01:44:12.342 --> 01:44:13.758
I appreciate your concern,

01:44:13.842 --> 01:44:16.050
but all the money in the world
won't help us now.

01:44:16.175 --> 01:44:18.508
It's not money I'm offering.

01:44:18.592 --> 01:44:20.133
You.

01:44:21.050 --> 01:44:23.008
You are a man of faith,

01:44:23.092 --> 01:44:26.008
and I have been
very blessed lately.

01:44:29.342 --> 01:44:32.092
I want to share
my blessing with you.

01:44:33.050 --> 01:44:35.717
The power of positive thinking.

01:44:39.508 --> 01:44:41.633
Now...

01:44:41.717 --> 01:44:45.175
tell me, Mr. President,
what do you need?

01:44:45.258 --> 01:44:48.717
And you're not speaking to me
here, but to the universe.

01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:51.175
What do you wish for?

01:44:53.425 --> 01:44:56.175
What is there to wish for but more?

01:44:56.258 --> 01:44:58.383
More nuclear weapons.
More than they have.

01:44:58.467 --> 01:45:00.092
Closer to 'em.

01:45:00.175 --> 01:45:02.050
If I just had that in place,

01:45:02.133 --> 01:45:04.258
then they would
have to listen to us.

01:45:04.342 --> 01:45:07.550
A nice thought.
And I grant you...

01:45:10.383 --> 01:45:11.717
Oh... Oh, my...

01:45:16.675 --> 01:45:20.008
And you know what I'd like?

01:45:20.092 --> 01:45:24.217
I would want all of your power,
influence, authority.

01:45:24.300 --> 01:45:25.633
All the respect you command

01:45:25.717 --> 01:45:30.050
and the command
everyone must respect.

01:45:35.758 --> 01:45:38.717
I mean, what else is there?

01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:41.592
Now, tell your people
I would appreciate

01:45:41.675 --> 01:45:45.425
absolutely no interference
whatsoever.

01:45:45.508 --> 01:45:47.800
No taxes, no rule of law,
no limits.

01:45:47.883 --> 01:45:52.550
Treat me like a foreign nation
with absolute autonomy.

01:45:53.842 --> 01:45:55.175
Very good, sir.

01:45:55.258 --> 01:45:56.383
Right away.

01:46:03.967 --> 01:46:05.133
What's this?

01:46:05.217 --> 01:46:06.467
Global Broadcast Satellite.

01:46:06.550 --> 01:46:08.092
Top-secret program
that enables us

01:46:08.175 --> 01:46:10.175
to override any broadcast
system in the world

01:46:10.258 --> 01:46:14.133
in case we need direct contact
with the people of an enemy state.

01:46:14.217 --> 01:46:15.383
So what does that mean?

01:46:15.467 --> 01:46:17.758
You're taking over
everyone's TVs?

01:46:17.842 --> 01:46:19.008
How?

01:46:19.092 --> 01:46:20.550
It uses
particle beam technology,

01:46:20.633 --> 01:46:22.550
just like
the Star Wars program.

01:46:22.633 --> 01:46:25.925
Apparently, it bathes the landscape
in a signal of particles that goes in

01:46:26.008 --> 01:46:28.800
and fiddles with
any technology it touches.

01:46:28.883 --> 01:46:31.717
New or old.
Broadcast whatever you want.

01:46:31.800 --> 01:46:33.300
Very impressive.

01:46:33.383 --> 01:46:37.883
You said "touches"?

01:46:37.967 --> 01:46:41.050
As in the particles
you are sending...

01:46:43.633 --> 01:46:48.258
are touching everything?

01:46:48.342 --> 01:46:49.800
It's a figure of speech,

01:46:49.883 --> 01:46:51.467
but yes.

01:46:51.550 --> 01:46:52.967
- That's how it was explained to me.
- I need immediate access

01:46:53.050 --> 01:46:55.633
to this satellite.
And a chopper

01:46:55.717 --> 01:46:56.925
to get me there.

01:46:57.008 --> 01:46:58.300
Yes, sir. Right away.

01:47:08.925 --> 01:47:10.842
Well, aren't you resourceful?

01:47:10.925 --> 01:47:14.217
Come with me before you do
any more damage, Max.

01:47:14.300 --> 01:47:15.883
No. I don't think so.

01:47:15.967 --> 01:47:17.633
Remove this woman, please...

01:47:17.717 --> 01:47:19.592
permanently.

01:47:28.425 --> 01:47:30.758
- Are you okay?
- I don't know.

01:47:33.925 --> 01:47:35.092
No, Steve. You can't use that.

01:47:35.175 --> 01:47:37.758
It's not their fault.

01:48:25.383 --> 01:48:26.717
That's neat.

01:49:00.050 --> 01:49:01.633
Barbara.

01:49:04.675 --> 01:49:06.592
I can't let you do this, Diana.

01:49:37.258 --> 01:49:40.050
Barbara. What...

01:49:40.133 --> 01:49:43.133
- How...
- I can't let you stop Max.

01:49:43.217 --> 01:49:45.883
You're not the only one
with something to lose.

01:49:49.425 --> 01:49:51.800
Turns out wishing
to be like you...

01:49:53.008 --> 01:49:55.092
came with some surprises.

01:49:58.592 --> 01:49:59.842
Hands up.

01:49:59.925 --> 01:50:01.175
- Hands up.
- Hands up, hands up.

01:50:01.258 --> 01:50:02.342
Hands up!

01:50:02.425 --> 01:50:04.258
- Hands up!
- Now! Now, now!

01:50:17.842 --> 01:50:19.217
Open fire!

01:50:33.967 --> 01:50:37.175
Oh, how sweet,
defending your love. Huh?

01:50:37.258 --> 01:50:40.133
What do you wish for?
Do you wanna be a real boy?

01:50:40.217 --> 01:50:41.633
No.

01:50:41.717 --> 01:50:44.050
Just not to be handcuffed to
you, but now I am.

01:50:51.675 --> 01:50:53.467
I just learned that.

01:51:05.550 --> 01:51:06.967
Barbara, stop!

01:51:09.467 --> 01:51:10.633
Ahh!

01:51:18.258 --> 01:51:19.342
Listen.

01:51:19.425 --> 01:51:20.383
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

01:51:20.467 --> 01:51:21.758
I'm not what you think.

01:51:21.842 --> 01:51:23.092
You can't possibly
understand or handle...

01:51:23.175 --> 01:51:25.258
Oh, I can't
possibly understand?

01:51:28.842 --> 01:51:29.967
Oh...

01:51:30.050 --> 01:51:31.675
Dumb little old me.

01:51:31.758 --> 01:51:33.258
Dumb little, poor little

01:51:33.342 --> 01:51:35.300
nothing, nobody me.

01:51:35.383 --> 01:51:36.925
I couldn't possibly handle it.

01:51:37.008 --> 01:51:39.633
No, Barbara.
That's not what I'm saying.

01:51:45.550 --> 01:51:48.425
Well,
I'm handling it beautifully.

01:51:48.508 --> 01:51:50.217
And I'm not giving it back!

01:52:14.508 --> 01:52:15.425
Go.

01:52:16.425 --> 01:52:17.467
Run!

01:52:18.550 --> 01:52:19.883
Everyone, stand down.

01:52:20.550 --> 01:52:22.800
Nobody hurts her.

01:52:24.383 --> 01:52:26.633
They couldn't if they tried.

01:52:31.050 --> 01:52:33.092
You've always
had everything,

01:52:33.175 --> 01:52:36.175
while people like me
have had nothing.

01:52:36.258 --> 01:52:40.675
Well, now it's my turn.
And you are not taking it from me. Ever!

01:52:42.258 --> 01:52:44.008
But what is it costing you?

01:52:44.092 --> 01:52:45.550
What is it costing me?

01:52:45.633 --> 01:52:49.008
If it's the monkey's paw,
it takes as much as it gives.

01:52:51.050 --> 01:52:53.925
Yes, you're strong...

01:52:54.008 --> 01:52:57.050
but what did you lose, Barbara?

01:52:57.133 --> 01:53:00.675
Where's your warmth, your joy,

01:53:00.758 --> 01:53:02.258
your humanity?

01:53:02.342 --> 01:53:06.217
You're attacking innocent men,
Barbara. Look at yourself.

01:53:06.300 --> 01:53:08.217
Forget about me.

01:53:08.300 --> 01:53:10.550
What is it costing you?

01:53:15.592 --> 01:53:18.092
Yeah, yeah.

01:53:18.217 --> 01:53:20.092
That's right.

01:53:20.842 --> 01:53:22.925
Get used to it.

01:53:25.550 --> 01:53:28.008
If you go after Max Lord...

01:53:28.758 --> 01:53:31.092
or hurt him in any way,

01:53:31.175 --> 01:53:32.717
I will destroy you.

01:53:32.800 --> 01:53:33.842
Barbara!

01:53:51.133 --> 01:53:53.008
Are you all right?

01:54:14.383 --> 01:54:16.550
Room for one more?

01:54:25.050 --> 01:54:26.342
<i>Sir, you need to wait.</i>

01:54:26.425 --> 01:54:27.717
The President has
a meeting right now.

01:54:27.800 --> 01:54:28.717
We need
to see the President.

01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:30.342
He needs to be told.

01:54:30.425 --> 01:54:32.258
- This is a matter of life and death.
- What is going on?

01:54:32.342 --> 01:54:35.258
The Soviets' early detection
system picked up our new nukes.

01:54:35.342 --> 01:54:37.300
<i>What new nukes?</i>

01:54:37.383 --> 01:54:39.842
<i>A hundred warheads just went
online, ready to launch.</i>

01:54:39.925 --> 01:54:42.133
<i>They're taking this
as an act of war.</i>

01:54:42.217 --> 01:54:43.758
Prepping to return fire.

01:54:43.842 --> 01:54:45.467
Return? What?

01:54:45.550 --> 01:54:47.508
We haven't done anything.

01:54:47.592 --> 01:54:49.092
That's not how it looks.

01:54:49.175 --> 01:54:51.592
And we'd fire for less.

01:54:54.508 --> 01:54:56.175
Are you kidding me?

01:54:56.258 --> 01:54:58.133
You blew through that light right there!
You didn't even see!

01:54:58.217 --> 01:54:59.550
How do you not see that?

01:54:59.633 --> 01:55:01.467
Riots across
the world erupting

01:55:01.550 --> 01:55:05.217
as America and the Soviet Union
end communication,

01:55:05.300 --> 01:55:07.217
declaring war!

01:55:07.300 --> 01:55:08.883
No one knows
any more than that.

01:55:08.967 --> 01:55:10.967
But as you can imagine
with what's at stake,

01:55:11.050 --> 01:55:13.342
there has been
madness down here

01:55:13.425 --> 01:55:14.800
in downtown Washington, D.C.

01:55:14.883 --> 01:55:16.717
The national guard
has been brought in...

01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:19.467
<i>Attention! Attention!</i>

01:55:19.550 --> 01:55:21.800
<i>By executive order,
all civilians</i>

01:55:21.883 --> 01:55:25.258
<i>must immediately evacuate the
Pennsylvania Avenue corridor</i>

01:55:25.342 --> 01:55:28.175
<i>between 3rd
and 12th streets northwest.</i>

01:55:36.133 --> 01:55:38.550
It is the final days
of tribulation

01:55:38.633 --> 01:55:40.758
that is happening to us now.

01:55:40.842 --> 01:55:44.300
Can you see
what your sinfulness has done?

01:55:44.383 --> 01:55:45.925
Your greed?

01:55:46.008 --> 01:55:48.717
You gotta do something!
You gotta do something!

01:55:49.925 --> 01:55:52.925
Come on! This way! Come on!

01:55:57.633 --> 01:55:59.342
Riley!

01:55:59.425 --> 01:56:00.967
All units.

01:56:01.050 --> 01:56:02.008
Riley!

01:56:02.092 --> 01:56:04.425
We need help.

01:56:04.508 --> 01:56:07.092
- It's chaos out here.
- Riley!

01:56:07.175 --> 01:56:10.842
What do you want me to do?
I don't know what to do.

01:56:10.925 --> 01:56:13.175
Somebody help me.

01:56:13.258 --> 01:56:15.550
I don't know what to do.

01:56:19.842 --> 01:56:21.342
Diana.

01:56:22.300 --> 01:56:24.133
Diana, listen to me.

01:56:28.717 --> 01:56:32.133
I had a great life.

01:56:33.092 --> 01:56:34.175
Steve...

01:56:34.258 --> 01:56:36.883
And you only made it better.

01:56:38.467 --> 01:56:41.717
But you know
what you need to do.

01:56:41.800 --> 01:56:43.383
The world needs you.

01:56:48.175 --> 01:56:50.342
- All right?
- No.

01:56:50.425 --> 01:56:52.092
Yeah.

01:57:04.925 --> 01:57:06.633
I'll never love again.

01:57:06.717 --> 01:57:08.717
I pray that isn't true.

01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:11.842
There's a wonderful,
big world out there.

01:57:11.925 --> 01:57:15.508
This crazy new world.

01:57:15.592 --> 01:57:18.800
And I am so happy
I got to see it...

01:57:19.675 --> 01:57:21.883
but it deserves you.

01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:33.842
I can't say goodbye.

01:57:33.925 --> 01:57:36.758
I can't say goodbye.

01:57:37.550 --> 01:57:39.508
You don't have to.

01:57:43.508 --> 01:57:46.175
I'm already gone.

01:58:00.050 --> 01:58:02.050
I'll always love you, Diana,

01:58:02.133 --> 01:58:05.008
no matter where I am.

01:58:05.092 --> 01:58:06.842
I love you.

01:58:09.550 --> 01:58:12.217
I renounce my wish.

01:59:07.092 --> 01:59:08.508
<i>It's easy.</i>

01:59:10.800 --> 01:59:13.717
<i>It's only wind and air...</i>

01:59:15.175 --> 01:59:17.092
<i>and how to ride it.</i>

01:59:19.133 --> 01:59:21.300
<i>How to catch it.</i>

02:00:34.342 --> 02:00:35.675
You made a wish too, huh?

02:00:40.050 --> 02:00:41.758
They're a bitch, aren't they?

02:00:41.842 --> 02:00:45.425
Make you pay a price,
but I've never been one for rules.

02:00:45.508 --> 02:00:47.675
Luckily, I have a way
to reverse it.

02:00:49.092 --> 02:00:51.550
The answer is always more.

02:00:51.633 --> 02:00:53.258
But you only get one wish.

02:00:53.342 --> 02:00:56.133
But I, my dear,
grant the wishes.

02:00:56.217 --> 02:00:59.342
So I take
what I want in return.

02:00:59.425 --> 02:01:02.342
There's nothing in this world
someone doesn't have.

02:01:02.425 --> 02:01:06.050
I'll rebuild my health,
wish by wish, organ by organ...

02:01:06.842 --> 02:01:08.217
if I have to.

02:01:09.592 --> 02:01:11.342
I'll be invincible.

02:01:12.758 --> 02:01:14.342
Tell me,

02:01:14.425 --> 02:01:16.467
what do you want?

02:01:16.550 --> 02:01:18.800
I'm feeling generous.

02:01:22.008 --> 02:01:26.300
I don't want to be
like anyone anymore.

02:01:28.342 --> 02:01:30.758
I want to be number one.

02:01:33.425 --> 02:01:36.133
An apex predator,

02:01:36.217 --> 02:01:39.717
like nothing
there's ever been before.

02:01:40.925 --> 02:01:43.550
I like the way you think.

02:01:44.800 --> 02:01:46.258
Go on.

02:01:58.967 --> 02:02:02.717
You heard we were
coming, I presume?

02:02:02.800 --> 02:02:05.800
How many broadcasting signals
can I take over at once?

02:02:05.883 --> 02:02:08.133
Well, as many as you like, sir.

02:02:08.217 --> 02:02:09.758
I'll take all of them.

02:02:09.842 --> 02:02:11.592
All of them?

02:02:11.675 --> 02:02:15.967
And I sure wish this works
for me. Don't you?

02:02:16.550 --> 02:02:17.925
Yes, sir.

02:02:20.925 --> 02:02:23.092
Lights, camera...

02:02:23.175 --> 02:02:24.800
Okay, stations 12,

02:02:24.883 --> 02:02:26.925
9, 16, go transmit.

02:02:27.008 --> 02:02:29.842
I need it now.
16, 9, 12. Do you receive?

02:02:29.925 --> 02:02:31.217
Copy. Maximum power.

02:02:31.300 --> 02:02:32.550
Okay. Moving forward now.

02:02:32.633 --> 02:02:34.300
Global transmission in five,

02:02:34.383 --> 02:02:36.967
four, three, two...

02:02:40.758 --> 02:02:43.050
<i>Citizens of the world,</i>

02:02:43.133 --> 02:02:47.592
<i>allow me to introduce myself.</i>

02:02:47.675 --> 02:02:50.258
<i>I am Max Lord,</i>

02:02:50.342 --> 02:02:52.925
<i>and I'm here
to change your life.</i>

02:02:53.842 --> 02:02:56.550
<i>All you have to do...</i>

02:02:57.592 --> 02:02:59.592
<i>is make a wish.</i>

02:03:00.758 --> 02:03:03.508
<i>Anything you want.</i>

02:03:03.592 --> 02:03:06.217
<i>Anything you dream of,
you can have it.</i>

02:03:07.550 --> 02:03:09.300
<i>If you can dream it...</i>

02:03:09.383 --> 02:03:10.342
Daddy?

02:03:10.425 --> 02:03:13.008
<i>...you can achieve it.</i>

02:03:13.092 --> 02:03:15.967
<i>So just look into my eyes...</i>

02:03:17.133 --> 02:03:19.550
<i>and make a wish.</i>

02:03:19.633 --> 02:03:22.967
<i>Anything you dream of,</i>

02:03:23.050 --> 02:03:24.175
<i>have it.</i>

02:03:25.675 --> 02:03:28.300
<i>Right now.</i>

02:03:28.383 --> 02:03:31.300
<i>Do you want to be rich?</i>

02:03:31.383 --> 02:03:34.467
<i>Do you want to be powerful?</i>

02:03:34.550 --> 02:03:36.133
Yeah, yeah.
Whatever you say.

02:03:36.217 --> 02:03:37.633
- <i>Say it out loud!</i>
- You know what I wish?

02:03:37.717 --> 02:03:39.175
- What? What?
- I wish all you Irish bastards

02:03:39.258 --> 02:03:41.633
would get sent back
to where you came from!

02:03:41.717 --> 02:03:43.133
Yeah? Well, I wish
you'd drop dead!

02:03:43.217 --> 02:03:46.258
<i>Look around you.</i>

02:03:46.342 --> 02:03:48.675
<i>Make your wish!</i>

02:03:48.758 --> 02:03:50.592
<i>Take what's yours.</i>

02:03:50.675 --> 02:03:52.592
<i>Whatever you want,</i>

02:03:52.675 --> 02:03:54.258
<i>you can have it.</i>

02:03:54.342 --> 02:03:56.175
I wish for a million dollars.

02:04:01.717 --> 02:04:03.342
<i>Wish for it.</i>

02:04:15.925 --> 02:04:18.217
<i>Anything you want.</i>

02:04:18.300 --> 02:04:22.592
<i>Anything you dream of, have it.</i>

02:04:23.300 --> 02:04:24.675
<i>Yes.</i>

02:04:24.758 --> 02:04:26.217
<i>I can hear it.</i>

02:04:26.300 --> 02:04:29.050
<i>I hear you.</i>

02:04:29.133 --> 02:04:30.217
<i>Yes, say it.</i>

02:04:30.300 --> 02:04:32.050
<i>Say it out loud.</i>

02:04:32.133 --> 02:04:33.925
That's right.
"I wish."

02:04:35.467 --> 02:04:36.425
Take it.

02:04:36.508 --> 02:04:38.800
Take it. It's all yours.

02:04:38.883 --> 02:04:40.717
It's all yours for the taking!

02:04:45.300 --> 02:04:48.258
And I... I take your health

02:04:48.925 --> 02:04:51.133
and your strength.

02:04:51.217 --> 02:04:52.800
Give her your rage

02:04:52.883 --> 02:04:54.800
and your prowess.

02:04:54.883 --> 02:04:57.800
And I take your power.

02:04:57.883 --> 02:05:00.008
I take your life force.

02:05:00.092 --> 02:05:01.925
Yes.

02:05:02.008 --> 02:05:03.508
Yes!

02:05:05.842 --> 02:05:07.633
That's right.

02:05:07.717 --> 02:05:10.425
You're doing great.

02:05:16.550 --> 02:05:18.300
<i>It's all yours.</i>

02:05:18.383 --> 02:05:19.842
I wish you were here, Daddy.

02:05:19.925 --> 02:05:21.800
I wish you'd come back.
Daddy, please!

02:05:21.883 --> 02:05:24.967
- <i>All you have to do is wish for it.</i>
- I'm still here, Daddy.

02:05:25.050 --> 02:05:26.883
Daddy, please!

02:06:40.425 --> 02:06:42.425
Barbara.

02:06:43.175 --> 02:06:45.550
What did you do?

02:08:33.050 --> 02:08:34.050
No.

02:08:35.425 --> 02:08:37.633
You renounced your wish.

02:08:37.717 --> 02:08:40.633
I had to. And so do you.

02:08:40.717 --> 02:08:44.300
Nothing good is born
from lies, Barbara.

02:08:44.383 --> 02:08:47.133
We're wasting precious time.

02:08:47.217 --> 02:08:51.467
Even now, patronizing me.

02:10:21.133 --> 02:10:22.883
Barbara...

02:10:22.967 --> 02:10:24.758
I know you're in there. Please.

02:10:24.842 --> 02:10:26.592
Please, renounce your wish.

02:10:26.675 --> 02:10:28.008
It's over.

02:10:28.092 --> 02:10:30.050
Please!

02:10:30.133 --> 02:10:31.883
Renounce your wish.

02:10:31.967 --> 02:10:33.217
Never!

02:10:36.425 --> 02:10:38.342
Then I'm so sorry.

02:11:21.175 --> 02:11:22.675
That's right.

02:11:22.758 --> 02:11:24.467
Just wish for it.

02:11:24.550 --> 02:11:26.008
It's yours now.

02:11:27.217 --> 02:11:29.758
All you have to do is
say it out loud.

02:11:29.842 --> 02:11:32.383
Make a wish. Any wish.

02:11:32.467 --> 02:11:35.717
Look into my eyes,
and everything you've been waiting for,

02:11:35.800 --> 02:11:37.383
it's all yours.

02:11:37.467 --> 02:11:38.425
You're too late.

02:11:40.175 --> 02:11:42.008
Granted.

02:11:42.925 --> 02:11:44.383
Granted.

02:11:45.175 --> 02:11:46.967
Granted.

02:11:47.800 --> 02:11:49.592
Granted!

02:11:49.675 --> 02:11:52.342
- Granted.
- Why are you doing this?

02:11:52.425 --> 02:11:54.133
Don't you have enough?

02:11:54.217 --> 02:11:56.050
Why not more?

02:11:56.133 --> 02:11:57.800
Why not wish for more?

02:11:57.883 --> 02:12:00.300
But they don't know
what you're taking from them.

02:12:00.383 --> 02:12:02.467
We want what we want.

02:12:02.550 --> 02:12:04.258
Just like you did.

02:12:06.342 --> 02:12:07.842
So make a wish.

02:12:07.925 --> 02:12:09.008
Very good.

02:12:19.133 --> 02:12:21.175
Granted.

02:12:23.133 --> 02:12:25.758
It's too late, Diana.

02:12:25.842 --> 02:12:28.425
They already heard me.

02:12:28.508 --> 02:12:30.883
Already wished!

02:12:32.758 --> 02:12:36.842
And those that haven't yet...

02:12:38.967 --> 02:12:42.092
oh, they will!

02:12:55.300 --> 02:12:57.342
Granted.

02:12:57.425 --> 02:12:59.467
Granted.

02:13:00.508 --> 02:13:01.967
Granted.

02:13:07.717 --> 02:13:10.008
Poor Diana.

02:13:10.967 --> 02:13:13.300
Why be such a hero?

02:13:14.508 --> 02:13:17.217
You could have kept your pilot

02:13:17.300 --> 02:13:18.925
and your powers,

02:13:19.008 --> 02:13:22.217
if only you'd join me.

02:13:22.300 --> 02:13:25.550
Wanna reconsider?

02:13:26.550 --> 02:13:29.758
I'm a forgiving man!

02:13:33.717 --> 02:13:35.800
You want him back?

02:13:35.883 --> 02:13:38.342
Just say the word.

02:13:38.425 --> 02:13:41.008
You can have it all!

02:13:41.092 --> 02:13:45.300
You just have to want it!

02:13:47.342 --> 02:13:50.633
I've never wanted
anything more.

02:13:56.508 --> 02:13:59.467
But he's gone...

02:13:59.550 --> 02:14:02.592
and that's the truth.

02:14:02.675 --> 02:14:04.967
And everything has a price.

02:14:05.050 --> 02:14:07.550
One I'm not willing to pay.

02:14:07.633 --> 02:14:09.217
Not anymore.

02:14:15.925 --> 02:14:21.133
This world was a beautiful
place just as it was...

02:14:22.217 --> 02:14:25.592
and you cannot have it all.

02:14:25.675 --> 02:14:29.258
You can only have the truth.

02:14:29.342 --> 02:14:32.300
And the truth is enough.

02:14:32.383 --> 02:14:34.717
The truth is beautiful.

02:14:37.717 --> 02:14:39.883
So look at this world...

02:14:41.217 --> 02:14:45.675
and look at what your wish
is costing it.

02:14:45.758 --> 02:14:49.633
You must be the hero.

02:14:49.717 --> 02:14:53.258
Only you can save the day.

02:14:54.800 --> 02:14:57.675
Renounce your wish

02:14:57.758 --> 02:14:59.883
if you want to save this world.

02:14:59.967 --> 02:15:02.342
Why would I...

02:15:02.425 --> 02:15:06.175
when it's finally my turn?

02:15:07.675 --> 02:15:11.217
The world belongs to me!

02:15:11.300 --> 02:15:15.300
You can't stop me. No one can!

02:15:16.675 --> 02:15:18.758
I wasn't talking to you.

02:15:26.425 --> 02:15:29.883
I was talking to everyone else.

02:15:34.050 --> 02:15:37.342
<i>Because you're not the only one
who has suffered.</i>

02:15:38.800 --> 02:15:40.175
<i>Who wants more.</i>

02:15:44.133 --> 02:15:47.300
<i>Who wants them back.</i>

02:15:48.967 --> 02:15:52.092
<i>Who doesn't want
to be afraid anymore.</i>

02:15:55.550 --> 02:15:57.550
<i>Or alone.</i>

02:15:57.633 --> 02:15:59.050
<i>Stop!</i>

02:15:59.133 --> 02:16:01.425
Cut the signal! Stop!

02:16:01.508 --> 02:16:03.550
Or frightened.

02:16:03.633 --> 02:16:06.217
Or powerless.

02:16:06.300 --> 02:16:09.967
'Cause you're not the only one
who imagined a world

02:16:10.050 --> 02:16:13.383
where everything was different.

02:16:17.883 --> 02:16:19.175
<i>Better.</i>

02:16:19.258 --> 02:16:21.842
<i>Finally.</i>

02:16:25.175 --> 02:16:29.425
<i>A world where they were loved</i>

02:16:29.508 --> 02:16:32.758
<i>and seen, and appreciated.</i>

02:16:33.383 --> 02:16:34.342
Finally.

02:16:34.424 --> 02:16:36.424
<i>Oh, my God. Who is he?</i>

02:16:36.508 --> 02:16:38.758
He doesn't even speak English.

02:16:38.842 --> 02:16:40.592
What is he eating?

02:16:40.674 --> 02:16:41.758
Look at his shoes!

02:16:43.133 --> 02:16:44.174
Weirdo!

02:17:03.758 --> 02:17:07.633
<i>But what is it costing you?</i>

02:17:07.717 --> 02:17:10.217
Do you see the truth?

02:17:22.342 --> 02:17:23.342
<i>Daddy!</i>

02:17:25.049 --> 02:17:26.967
<i>Daddy!</i>

02:17:36.924 --> 02:17:40.717
The Russians are launching.
We've got orders to counter.

02:17:40.799 --> 02:17:42.633
All right, all right.

02:18:00.217 --> 02:18:02.133
Alistair!

02:18:03.424 --> 02:18:04.883
<i>Emergency alert.</i>

02:18:04.967 --> 02:18:07.217
<i>You have four minutes
to find shelter.</i>

02:18:12.092 --> 02:18:14.342
Alistair!

02:18:14.424 --> 02:18:16.592
My son!

02:18:16.674 --> 02:18:19.549
<i>Stay calm
and stay indoors.</i>

02:18:19.633 --> 02:18:21.342
Alistair!

02:18:21.424 --> 02:18:24.342
<i>Daddy! Daddy!</i>

02:18:24.424 --> 02:18:25.467
Help me, Daddy!

02:18:25.549 --> 02:18:27.174
<i>This is not a test.</i>

02:18:27.258 --> 02:18:28.342
Daddy!

02:18:30.967 --> 02:18:32.383
<i>Daddy!</i>

02:18:32.467 --> 02:18:34.258
<i>One-minute warning.</i>

02:18:35.299 --> 02:18:37.258
Wait. My son!

02:18:37.342 --> 02:18:39.174
I can see my son!

02:18:39.258 --> 02:18:41.092
Save him, Max.

02:18:42.633 --> 02:18:44.299
I have to save my son.

02:18:44.383 --> 02:18:45.967
<i>Daddy!</i>

02:18:46.049 --> 02:18:47.217
Alistair.

02:18:47.299 --> 02:18:49.549
Daddy!

02:18:49.633 --> 02:18:50.717
Daddy!

02:18:51.383 --> 02:18:54.174
My... Alistair.

02:18:55.467 --> 02:18:57.842
I renounce my wish!

02:19:12.508 --> 02:19:14.217
I renounce my wish.

02:19:17.508 --> 02:19:20.133
We have missiles
disappearing, sir.

02:19:21.133 --> 02:19:22.383
Yes, sir.

02:19:22.467 --> 02:19:24.717
<i>They are vanishing
from our screen.</i>

02:19:28.174 --> 02:19:30.592
<i>Only just hearing
now that a ceasefire</i>

02:19:30.674 --> 02:19:33.049
<i>between the Soviet Union
and the United States</i>

02:19:33.133 --> 02:19:35.758
<i>has averted
a global nuclear crisis.</i>

02:19:37.592 --> 02:19:39.424
I renounce my wish.

02:19:57.592 --> 02:19:58.967
- I take back my wish.
- I renounce my wish.

02:20:21.258 --> 02:20:23.550
Alistair!

02:20:30.092 --> 02:20:32.008
Alistair!

02:20:32.425 --> 02:20:35.050
Alistair!

02:20:37.508 --> 02:20:38.508
Daddy!

02:20:45.008 --> 02:20:46.925
- Daddy!
- Alistair!

02:20:51.050 --> 02:20:52.800
Alistair.

02:20:55.967 --> 02:20:58.008
Oh, Alistair, Alistair.

02:20:58.092 --> 02:21:00.508
I'm so sorry, baby.

02:21:02.425 --> 02:21:06.633
I'm so glad I wished you'd come.
I knew it would work.

02:21:09.592 --> 02:21:10.675
No.

02:21:11.758 --> 02:21:13.800
That is not why I'm back.

02:21:14.467 --> 02:21:15.550
No.

02:21:17.425 --> 02:21:19.633
I've been lying to you.

02:21:21.050 --> 02:21:24.175
I'm not a great guy.

02:21:24.258 --> 02:21:27.092
In fact, I'm a pretty
messed up, loser guy.

02:21:29.092 --> 02:21:31.883
And I made terrible mistakes.

02:21:32.717 --> 02:21:34.467
But you...

02:21:36.342 --> 02:21:40.133
you don't ever have to make
a wish for me to love you.

02:21:41.592 --> 02:21:44.133
I'm here because I love you.

02:21:46.467 --> 02:21:48.425
I just...

02:21:48.508 --> 02:21:50.675
I just wish and I pray that,
one day,

02:21:50.758 --> 02:21:52.342
I'll be able to
make you proud enough

02:21:52.425 --> 02:21:55.133
that you'll be
able to forgive me.

02:21:56.592 --> 02:21:58.425
And love me.

02:21:58.508 --> 02:22:01.467
Because I'm nothing
to be proud of, Alistair.

02:22:01.550 --> 02:22:04.592
I don't need you
to make me proud.

02:22:04.675 --> 02:22:07.133
I already love you, Daddy.

02:22:07.217 --> 02:22:09.425
You're my dad.

02:22:56.383 --> 02:22:59.133
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Sorry.

02:22:59.217 --> 02:23:01.675
It's okay. It's okay.

02:23:06.717 --> 02:23:08.967
So beautiful.

02:23:14.050 --> 02:23:18.633
Sorry.
Just talking to myself.

02:23:20.883 --> 02:23:22.758
It's all right.

02:23:22.842 --> 02:23:24.550
It's just that...

02:23:24.633 --> 02:23:29.633
It's wonderful.
It's so many things.

02:23:30.592 --> 02:23:32.133
Yeah.

02:23:33.133 --> 02:23:35.175
I know what you mean.

02:23:40.550 --> 02:23:42.508
I like your...

02:23:42.592 --> 02:23:43.800
I like your outfit.

02:23:44.342 --> 02:23:46.008
You like...

02:23:46.092 --> 02:23:47.092
Thanks.

02:23:47.175 --> 02:23:49.050
You know, my friends...

02:23:49.133 --> 02:23:52.508
they kinda tease me about it,
but it works, right?

02:23:52.592 --> 02:23:54.467
- You look great.
- Thank you.

02:23:54.550 --> 02:23:57.008
You just made my day.

02:24:04.717 --> 02:24:07.717
- Happy holidays. See you around.
- Happy holidays.

02:24:47.675 --> 02:24:50.883
So many things.

02:24:53.258 --> 02:24:56.925
So, so many things.

02:26:32.925 --> 02:26:34.842
- Whoa!
- Look out!

02:26:37.592 --> 02:26:39.092
Oh, my God.

02:26:40.800 --> 02:26:42.717
- Mom, would you take her?
- Yeah.

02:26:42.800 --> 02:26:44.383
Um, excuse me.

02:26:44.467 --> 02:26:47.633
Excuse me. Please,
you have to let me thank you, Miss...

02:26:48.967 --> 02:26:50.092
Asteria.

02:26:50.175 --> 02:26:52.925
Asteria. Wow.
That's a beautiful name.

02:26:53.008 --> 02:26:54.467
It's from my culture.

02:26:54.550 --> 02:26:56.925
I can't thank you enough.
I mean, you saved my daughter.

02:26:57.008 --> 02:26:58.758
How did you do that?

02:26:58.842 --> 02:27:02.842
It's just a simple shift of weight.
Takes practice.

02:27:02.925 --> 02:27:06.342
But I've been
doing this a long time.
