WEBVTT

00:00.023 --> 00:01.786
He was my father, Magnum.

00:01.823 --> 00:05.157
I am the private investigator
so let me investigate.

00:08.164 --> 00:11.099
Miles Archer was court-martialed
for absence.

00:11.134 --> 00:13.102
He wasn't a coward or a thief.

00:13.136 --> 00:15.536
It was 40 years ago.
What does it matter now?

00:15.571 --> 00:17.664
The past lives in the past.

00:17.707 --> 00:20.608
You want to handle this?
Then do it by yourself!

00:20.643 --> 00:24.282
Why are you pursuing an obviously futile
exercise with such determination?

00:24.307 --> 00:27.470
- What did I tell you?
- Come on, T.C., we didn't get a scratch.

03:59.562 --> 04:01.723
Stay where you are! Don't move!

04:04.734 --> 04:09.034
OK, hold your fire, boys.
I'm gonna come without a fight.

04:46.175 --> 04:49.440
Supposed to get any sleep?

04:53.149 --> 04:54.946
- Hi, ladies.
- Good morning.

04:54.984 --> 05:00.217
Hello, Agatha. Higgins,
do you have any idea what time it is?

05:00.256 --> 05:02.315
Yes, and I'm dreadfully sorry.

05:02.358 --> 05:05.054
- You are?
- Yes, I should have started earlier.

05:05.094 --> 05:09.258
After all, you woke me at 5:30,
roaring in here like Mario Andretti.

05:09.298 --> 05:11.698
Higgins, I was on a case. Really!

05:11.734 --> 05:15.465
I mean, I was staking out
this all-night Mongolian barbecue on King.

05:15.504 --> 05:18.098
Actually,
you might find this interesting...

05:18.140 --> 05:23.578
Please, Magnum. Where, how and
with whom you spent the night is irrelevant.

05:23.613 --> 05:28.175
I cannot ready this float for the maritime festival
tiptoeing around your schedule.

05:28.217 --> 05:35.180
Higgins, don't you think you ought to
finish the float before you start taking photos?

05:35.891 --> 05:38.325
Or is it finished?

05:38.361 --> 05:42.195
Hardly. I'm doing a photo-essay
delineating each stage of its development.

05:42.231 --> 05:44.426
Oh, well, who's developing this?

05:44.467 --> 05:48.961
We are the Anglo-Polynesian
Savants of the Sea, Mr. Magnum.

05:49.005 --> 05:52.099
It's a charity dedicated to
the preservation of our oceans.

05:52.141 --> 05:56.202
For one whose appreciation of the sea
is limited to sushi bars and surf skiing,

05:56.245 --> 05:59.772
- I can hardly expect you to understand.
- I understand, Higgins.

05:59.815 --> 06:03.444
This is clear as a bell.
There's only one thing I don't understand.

06:04.920 --> 06:06.911
What is it?

06:08.357 --> 06:10.848
It is perfectly obvious.

06:10.893 --> 06:13.191
It is?

06:20.436 --> 06:22.427
Thanks.

06:25.641 --> 06:27.768
How did you get through the gate?

06:27.810 --> 06:31.769
It was open, Mr. Magnum.
Hi, I'm Bridget Archer, your new client.

06:31.814 --> 06:35.477
I beg your pardon. I am not Mr. Magnum.
He is Mr. Magnum.

06:35.518 --> 06:39.477
People always mix us up. Thomas Magnum,
Miss Archer, what can I do for you?

06:39.522 --> 06:43.014
A lot, I hope. Lieutenant Poole said
maybe you could help me.

06:43.059 --> 06:44.890
Lieutenant Poole? Where'd you meet her?

06:44.927 --> 06:47.828
She was one of the people
who interrogated me.

06:47.863 --> 06:50.525
- Interrogated you?
- Right after the arrest.

06:51.600 --> 06:54.398
- The Navy arrested you?
- Have you had breakfast?

06:54.437 --> 06:57.634
Are you kidding? I haven't eaten
anything decent since Cleveland.

06:57.673 --> 07:01.473
- Except a moldy bear claw.
- I think I can do better than that.

07:01.510 --> 07:03.808
Don't bet on it.

07:03.846 --> 07:08.112
- And why not?
- Philadelphia will destroy the Cavaliers.

07:08.150 --> 07:11.449
- Not this time.
- You're kidding. They'll walk all over them.

07:11.487 --> 07:15.287
I got a C-note it's gonna be Philly
by ten points.

07:15.324 --> 07:17.849
You got a C-note? Let me see it.

07:17.893 --> 07:21.351
Come on, T.C., that's a figure of speech.
You know what I'm saying.

07:21.397 --> 07:24.423
I know. What you're saying is you ain't got it.

07:24.467 --> 07:26.298
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Thomas.

07:26.335 --> 07:29.361
- What's the morning line?
- Want to bet on the Cavalier-Philly game?

07:29.405 --> 07:32.499
You can forget the morning line.
No one knows this yet,

07:32.541 --> 07:35.772
but Wedman pulled a hamstring,
Robinson's got the flu.

07:35.811 --> 07:39.804
I hate to admit it,
but the Sixers are going to cream them.

07:39.849 --> 07:42.010
So, take Philly by 20 points.

07:45.221 --> 07:48.315
Well, what do you expect? Cookie recipes?

07:53.129 --> 07:56.064
What about the Pistons and the Bucks?

07:56.098 --> 07:58.225
I think I'm in love.

07:58.934 --> 08:03.564
Ten minutes to ten. I wondered how long
it was gonna take you to fall in love today.

08:07.676 --> 08:10.270
Boy...

08:10.312 --> 08:12.712
It sure beats the view from my motel.

08:12.748 --> 08:16.206
All I can see are the backs of those hotels
in Waikiki.

08:16.252 --> 08:18.379
- Miss Archer...
- Bridget.

08:19.021 --> 08:20.454
Bridget.

08:20.489 --> 08:24.755
It's a little bit like looking at a football game
from behind the bleachers.

08:24.794 --> 08:26.853
- Bridget.
- What?

08:27.396 --> 08:29.387
Why did the Navy arrest you?

08:30.499 --> 08:35.265
They didn't.
They just sort of intercepted the boat.

08:35.304 --> 08:37.966
- What boat?
- I rented a boat.

08:38.006 --> 08:40.770
How the hell else
could I get to the Arizona? Walk?

08:40.809 --> 08:42.573
You could always take the tour.

08:42.611 --> 08:44.909
Look, I asked the Navy to help, see?

08:44.947 --> 08:49.043
I talked to everybody from the local recruiter
in Cleveland to some general in Honolulu.

08:49.084 --> 08:51.951
Admiral. In the Navy, they're admirals.
More coffee?

08:51.987 --> 08:57.357
Yeah. There's some uniform
named Wheeler who's very hoity-toity.

08:57.393 --> 08:59.384
Boy, all he could say was no.

08:59.428 --> 09:01.658
He'd been in the Navy for six years.

09:02.465 --> 09:04.330
Admiral Wheeler?

09:04.366 --> 09:07.062
- My father.
- Oh!

09:07.536 --> 09:09.766
Seaman Second Class, Miles Archer.

09:12.341 --> 09:16.004
Served on the Arizona
when Pearl Harbor was attacked.

09:17.379 --> 09:19.370
I'm sorry.

09:19.415 --> 09:21.542
No, no. He survived.

09:23.052 --> 09:27.352
He passed away here, last month, in
Honolulu. That's why I'm here. To bury him.

09:29.892 --> 09:33.794
And since the Navy won't help,
well, I decided...

09:34.997 --> 09:36.521
to bury him myself.

09:41.270 --> 09:43.465
- Dad?
- Dad.

09:50.713 --> 09:52.704
Are you finished with these?

09:53.816 --> 09:57.445
- Yeah, I'm not gonna eat anything else.
- OK. Thanks.

09:58.821 --> 10:04.282
So you just rented a boat and motored out
to dump his ashes over the Arizona, right?

10:05.227 --> 10:07.058
Yeah.

10:07.096 --> 10:10.065
And I'm gonna do it, too. With your help.

10:18.707 --> 10:22.143
<i>Being a private investigator's
pretty flexible.</i>

10:22.177 --> 10:26.511
<i>But there are a few cardinal rules
we always try and follow.</i>

10:28.183 --> 10:30.447
<i>First, talk money right up front</i>.

10:31.287 --> 10:36.691
<i>Second, if it doesn't feel right,
don't do it, regardless of the money.</i>

10:36.725 --> 10:39.387
<i>Now, with Bridget, I'd blown both rules</i>.

10:39.428 --> 10:43.091
<i>We hadn't settled on a fee,
and she was pretty weird.</i>

10:43.132 --> 10:46.624
<i>But she had guts and a decent story,
which makes up for a lot,</i>

10:46.669 --> 10:51.971
<i>and brings me to a personal rule</i> -
<i>never count on anything, especially rules</i>.

10:52.007 --> 10:55.807
We've got rules and regulations.
They exist for very good reasons.

10:55.844 --> 10:59.336
Of course. But you gotta admit
she's got a legitimate request.

11:00.149 --> 11:03.380
Which has been processed and denied.

11:03.419 --> 11:07.856
Sure, by some paper-clipper
following a book of regulations.

11:09.258 --> 11:12.989
It's signed by Admiral Philip Wheeler.
Good enough?

11:14.029 --> 11:16.190
- Wheeler?
- Sorry, Magnum.

11:17.366 --> 11:19.357
This material's classified.

11:23.939 --> 11:25.930
Lieutenant...

11:27.710 --> 11:30.235
Lieutenant, let me ask you something.

11:31.647 --> 11:33.638
Why did you send Bridget to me?

11:33.682 --> 11:37.243
I mean, it's so... unofficial.

11:38.454 --> 11:40.149
She was upset.

11:40.189 --> 11:44.148
- I thought, if she had someone to talk to...
- See!

11:44.193 --> 11:46.286
You do have a heart. I knew it!

11:46.328 --> 11:48.091
Well, of cour...

11:48.130 --> 11:51.725
That's irrelevant! Absolutely irrelevant!
What I did was just...

11:51.767 --> 11:55.032
Very thoughtful. Very considerate.

11:55.070 --> 11:57.197
It was what anyone else would have done.

11:57.239 --> 11:59.673
Not necessarily, Lieutenant.

12:00.209 --> 12:03.178
I think what you did was...

12:03.812 --> 12:06.337
I don't know. Nice.

12:07.916 --> 12:11.079
She took advantage of you.
That's the problem, isn't it?

12:11.120 --> 12:15.853
People are just not used
to dealing with nice people like you.

12:15.891 --> 12:18.655
It's not that. She's actually very nice.

12:18.694 --> 12:22.653
Maybe so, but, Maggie,
I think that Bridget was out of line.

12:22.698 --> 12:26.361
I mean, she has got to understand
about rules and regulations,

12:26.402 --> 12:28.393
the way things work.

12:28.437 --> 12:29.870
Thanks for the time.

12:29.905 --> 12:34.239
With any luck, I'll have her
on the first plane back to Cleveland.

12:36.679 --> 12:38.374
Magnum.

12:41.884 --> 12:45.376
Look, I'd really hate for her to go home
with this unresolved.

12:45.421 --> 12:48.913
Oh, Maggie,
I don't want you to compromise.

12:49.758 --> 12:51.817
Miles Archer was court-martialed

12:51.860 --> 12:55.352
in January 1942
for misappropriation of government property.

12:55.397 --> 12:56.386
What?

12:56.432 --> 13:00.300
The reason he was able to stand trial
was he was AWOL

13:00.335 --> 13:03.793
from the Arizona
on the morning of December 7th.

13:10.177 --> 13:12.168
She's lying. She's gotta be.

13:12.813 --> 13:14.804
No, she's not.

13:15.816 --> 13:18.876
She's just a good officer doing her job.

13:18.919 --> 13:23.253
Making other people's lives miserable.
What does she know about my father?

13:23.290 --> 13:27.226
He's just some name on a form,
he's a damn file number.

13:28.062 --> 13:30.053
Bridget...

13:30.097 --> 13:32.793
how much do you know about your father?

13:40.774 --> 13:44.642
I saw my dad maybe... four times
out of my whole life.

13:46.246 --> 13:49.579
There wasn't a thing
he didn't know about being a sailor

13:49.616 --> 13:53.712
- but he was rusty on the father bit.
- Well, it's a tough job.

13:53.754 --> 13:56.518
Yeah. My mother,
she never gave him much of a chance.

13:56.557 --> 14:00.926
I tell you one thing he wasn't, though.
He wasn't a coward or a thief.

14:00.961 --> 14:03.327
My old man was a straight-shooter.

14:03.364 --> 14:08.028
I'm gonna prove it. I'm gonna get him buried
on the Arizona, just like he asked.

14:08.936 --> 14:12.201
Bridget, that's not exactly gonna be easy.

14:12.239 --> 14:15.003
I can afford to stay in this dump
a couple more days.

14:15.042 --> 14:19.035
I'm gonna find people that knew him.
I'm going to find out the truth.

14:20.247 --> 14:22.841
You don't have to sweat it.
You're off the hook.

14:22.883 --> 14:25.249
I'm not worried about that.

14:26.887 --> 14:29.355
You want to settle up? Right? OK.

14:29.390 --> 14:32.985
OK, that's fine, you know. Here.
I hate owing anybody.

14:35.529 --> 14:37.793
I'll bill you.

14:40.467 --> 14:42.458
OK. Thanks.

14:46.340 --> 14:48.001
Bridget...

14:50.544 --> 14:52.774
You could bury him here.

14:52.813 --> 14:56.909
- In a cemetery, on the island.
- No! No! He was counting on me.

14:57.618 --> 15:02.612
Not many people in this world are counting
on Bridget Archer. I'm sticking with this!

15:04.291 --> 15:08.421
<i>There's another cardinal rule
a good private investigator follows.</i>

15:09.029 --> 15:13.989
<i>Don't try telling a client something
she doesn't want to hear. It never works.</i>

15:14.034 --> 15:17.162
<i>Sometimes you've just gotta let people go</i>.

15:17.838 --> 15:20.773
<i>If they want to tilt at windmills, let 'em tilt</i>.

15:28.315 --> 15:33.082
<i>I know what you're thinking,
but she had no money, no friends,</i>

15:33.120 --> 15:36.419
<i>and nothing but
the name of her father's landlady.</i>

15:36.457 --> 15:40.917
<i>I figured I'd just tag along
and try and keep her out of trouble.</i>

15:40.961 --> 15:43.259
<i>If I could keep up, that is</i>.

15:49.436 --> 15:52.303
- Mrs. Timura?
- Tamura.

15:52.339 --> 15:54.432
Hi. I'm Bridget Archer.

15:55.108 --> 15:56.769
Miles's daughter.

16:00.514 --> 16:01.879
Oh.

16:04.318 --> 16:05.683
Yes.

16:06.820 --> 16:10.847
You have the same eyes,
same tilt to the head,

16:12.793 --> 16:14.317
same color hair.

16:14.361 --> 16:17.387
Oh, you've known my father a long time.

16:17.431 --> 16:19.865
He's been bald for years.

16:22.202 --> 16:24.329
He was a boarder here for many years.

16:24.371 --> 16:28.535
Then he must have talked
about his days in the Navy, huh?

16:29.977 --> 16:32.104
Your father was a very private man.

16:33.347 --> 16:40.116
Um, Mrs. Tamura, I've been trying
to bury my father on the Arizona,

16:40.153 --> 16:44.021
and the Navy keeps telling me
he was a coward and a criminal,

16:44.057 --> 16:47.026
and I need to talk to somebody
who knew him then.

16:47.060 --> 16:48.994
The past lives in the past.

16:49.029 --> 16:52.294
Maybe, but I have questions
to ask about the past.

16:52.332 --> 16:56.701
Miss Archer,
your father was a decent man, always.

16:56.737 --> 17:00.730
- You can be proud of him.
- I am, that's why I'm trying to do this.

17:02.476 --> 17:06.502
Mrs. Tamura, if I could just talk to you
for a couple more seconds...

17:06.547 --> 17:10.175
Hey, wait a minute!
I gotta talk to her! What...?

17:13.387 --> 17:16.685
- Climb in. I'll be right back.
- Where are you going?

17:16.723 --> 17:19.123
To ask Mrs. Tamura something,
without you.

17:19.159 --> 17:21.354
- He was my father, Magnum.
- Look.

17:21.395 --> 17:25.525
I am the private investigator
so let me investigate. In private!

17:25.566 --> 17:27.864
- But...
- Bridget, you are always talking!

17:27.901 --> 17:31.098
It doesn't give anyone else a chance.
Trust me.

17:32.406 --> 17:35.102
Where have I heard that one before?

17:49.456 --> 17:51.447
- Yes?
- Mrs. Tamura.

17:51.491 --> 17:56.019
I'm Thomas Magnum, a private investigator.
May I come in for a minute?

17:56.063 --> 17:57.928
I've said all I can.

17:59.600 --> 18:03.730
Mrs. Tamura,
you said the past lives in the past.

18:03.770 --> 18:07.968
But for those without history,
there is only the present. Isn't that true?

18:08.008 --> 18:10.442
Yes, that is correct.

18:10.477 --> 18:13.674
Well, Bridget and her father
didn't have much time together.

18:13.714 --> 18:18.583
So in order to honor him and his memory,
she's got to do it now, in the present.

18:28.395 --> 18:30.727
Come in, please.

18:35.335 --> 18:37.326
Sit down.

18:39.473 --> 18:42.636
I knew Miles Archer since before the war.

18:42.676 --> 18:47.136
As friends at first, then... as much more.

18:47.180 --> 18:49.444
We were lovers for many years.

18:53.520 --> 18:58.048
- You knew him during the court martial.
- Yes, but he was innocent.

18:58.091 --> 19:01.288
Others implicated him
to protect themselves.

19:02.229 --> 19:06.563
Miles's only crime
was not speaking the truth,

19:06.600 --> 19:08.966
- or allowing me to do so.
- What truth?

19:09.002 --> 19:14.668
He discovered that two of his Navy shipmates
were selling in the black market.

19:14.708 --> 19:18.007
He threatened to report them,
but before he could do so,

19:18.045 --> 19:22.141
an incident was created
to make it appear that Miles was involved.

19:22.182 --> 19:24.650
- They set him up?
- Yes.

19:25.986 --> 19:28.921
The night it happened, December 6th,

19:29.856 --> 19:32.381
I was sick with a terrible fever.

19:32.426 --> 19:34.826
Miles came to me and would not leave.

19:34.861 --> 19:37.022
He was with you the entire night?

19:40.934 --> 19:44.529
He arrived at Pearl Harbor
the next morning

19:44.571 --> 19:46.937
in time to see his ship go down.

19:48.375 --> 19:50.536
He never got over that.

19:53.980 --> 19:57.541
Mrs. Tamura,
why didn't you testify at the court martial?

19:58.552 --> 20:00.452
I am Japanese.

20:00.487 --> 20:05.515
The officer who defended Miles felt
it would be useless for me to appear.

20:06.793 --> 20:12.254
Miles worried that I would be harmed
if anyone knew of our relationship.

20:15.535 --> 20:17.025
Miles...

20:18.038 --> 20:21.997
lived with this sadness for so long.

20:25.045 --> 20:28.640
Is it necessary that
his daughter now share it as well?

20:30.150 --> 20:32.141
It sure is.

20:37.724 --> 20:40.852
<i>Miles's story was like
a hundred others I'd seen.</i>

20:40.894 --> 20:45.058
<i>The closer you looked, the more you saw,
and the more you wanted to know.</i>

20:45.098 --> 20:48.829
<i>I asked Rick to do a little research
on the black market in '41,</i>

20:48.869 --> 20:53.966
<i>the kind of stuff you wouldn't find
in history books or Navy records.</i>

20:58.712 --> 21:01.340
<i>As for me, after a day with Bridget,</i>

21:01.381 --> 21:04.748
<i>I just wanted
a cold beer and some peace and quiet.</i>

21:05.886 --> 21:09.822
Magnum, there's nothing like
the whine of a high-performance engine

21:09.856 --> 21:13.883
to disrupt an absolutely delightful
afternoon tea. How thoughtful of you.

21:13.927 --> 21:19.092
- Gee, Higgins, I'm sorry. I just didn't realize.
- You didn't think, as usual.

21:19.132 --> 21:23.967
I suppose I should be grateful you didn't bring
that... whatever-she-does back here.

21:24.004 --> 21:27.303
She is a cocktail waitress
and she's at her motel freshening up.

21:27.340 --> 21:30.639
- Of course.
- Oh, how is the tea going?

21:30.677 --> 21:33.840
Are you dipping scones
and baking hot-cross buns?

21:33.880 --> 21:37.714
The tea, save for your interruption,
is smashing, absolutely smashing.

21:37.751 --> 21:40.879
That's exactly what this car is, smashing.

21:42.756 --> 21:47.284
What a beauty! Expensive mistress, huh?

21:48.094 --> 21:52.087
- Worth every penny, I'll bet.
- She sure is. You know, in fact I think...

21:52.132 --> 21:56.193
Yes, the Ferrari is one of Robin Masters'
favorites, Admiral Wheeler.

21:56.236 --> 21:59.501
Jonathan!
Oh, Jonathan, come quickly!

22:00.073 --> 22:02.041
Your buns are smoking!

22:06.313 --> 22:07.644
Excuse me.

22:08.515 --> 22:12.246
Hell, in a week and a half
I'll be jumping out of this uniform

22:12.285 --> 22:16.085
and I'm damn tempted
to go and try one of these things on.

22:16.756 --> 22:18.724
Don't you tell my wife that.

22:18.758 --> 22:20.350
I'm Thomas Magnum, sir.

22:20.393 --> 22:23.556
- Heard a lot about you.
- Probably too much.

22:23.597 --> 22:25.224
Hope it's all favorable.

22:25.265 --> 22:30.362
Well, you know, as a matter of fact,
I have a friend, her name's Bridget Archer,

22:30.403 --> 22:32.462
and she just flew out from Cleveland.

22:32.505 --> 22:35.770
You may know her. She checked
with you about her father. Miles.

22:35.809 --> 22:38.778
He was a seaman on the Arizona.

22:38.812 --> 22:43.044
- What business did you say you were in?
- I didn't. I'm a private investigator.

22:43.083 --> 22:47.884
I assume you know that Miles Archer was
court-martialed for unauthorized absence?

22:48.755 --> 22:52.156
I think it's possible
he didn't have an adequate defense, sir.

22:52.192 --> 22:55.491
- He had perfectly competent counsel.
- This woman...

22:55.528 --> 22:59.487
Archer was AWOL
on the eve of Pearl Harbor.

22:59.532 --> 23:03.127
His shipmates were not.
They've been dead for 40 years.

23:04.004 --> 23:08.031
Now, in my book, that gives him
no right to be buried with them.

23:08.942 --> 23:10.933
Good day.

23:15.048 --> 23:18.779
Wheeler was tough, Rick.
I mean, really tough.

23:18.818 --> 23:22.049
- The Navy's all business.
- They don't make mistakes.

23:22.088 --> 23:23.112
Thanks, Deborah.

23:23.156 --> 23:25.750
Yeah, I know. Wheeler reminded me.

23:25.792 --> 23:29.626
But there's just more to it than this, Rick.
There's gotta be.

23:29.663 --> 23:31.358
I can just feel it.

23:31.398 --> 23:33.366
- Hi.
- Hi.

23:33.400 --> 23:36.460
- How'd you do in the game?
- Hey, I scored big. Thank you!

23:36.503 --> 23:39.700
Don't mention it.
I was playing liar's dice with Wilkerson,

23:39.739 --> 23:42.731
that's how I found out about those guys.

23:42.776 --> 23:45.802
Thanks.
You're about the smartest lady I ever met.

23:46.579 --> 23:48.843
Thanks yourself.

23:48.882 --> 23:53.546
- So, what did you find out?
- You want to talk about this now?

23:53.586 --> 23:56.578
Yeah, if it's about my dad,
we'll talk about it now.

23:58.091 --> 24:01.925
OK. There's this guy in town,
his name is Vic Stout.

24:02.896 --> 24:07.390
About 40 years ago, his uncle Duke
ran all the black market here in Honolulu.

24:07.434 --> 24:12.428
At the time, Vic was just a runner.
When Duke died, he took over everything.

24:12.472 --> 24:15.202
Did you ever hear of Intra Pacific Imports?

24:15.241 --> 24:19.337
IPI is a legitimate front,
but Stout's in everything.

24:19.379 --> 24:22.644
The word on the street is
he's making megabucks heisting luxury cars

24:22.682 --> 24:26.379
- and selling them to the mainland.
- I'd like to talk to him.

24:26.419 --> 24:29.820
- You don't wanna talk to this guy.
- I wanna talk to this guy.

24:29.856 --> 24:32.324
You don't mess around
with a guy like Vic Stout,

24:32.359 --> 24:35.294
especially not about something like this.

24:36.863 --> 24:41.391
OK, back in '41,
a couple of honest coppers got iced.

24:41.434 --> 24:46.497
The story is that Vic Stout made his bones
on both of those hits. Listen, both of you.

24:46.539 --> 24:51.875
There's no statute of limitations on murder.
So just forget about this, please.

24:51.911 --> 24:57.076
Rick, Stout has got to be a businessman.
Maybe we can scratch each other's backs.

24:57.684 --> 24:59.049
With what?

25:01.554 --> 25:07.891
This is a horrible idea. In fact,
it's worse than horrible, it's a terrible idea.

25:07.927 --> 25:10.054
- You could have stayed with Bridget.
- You kidding?

25:10.096 --> 25:14.396
She was so mad you didn't let her come,
she would have torn me to pieces,

25:14.434 --> 25:16.629
which is probably what will happen anyway.

25:16.669 --> 25:18.500
Relax. Nothing will go wrong.

25:18.538 --> 25:22.099
Besides, we've been sitting here
for eight hours! I got a club to run.

25:22.142 --> 25:24.633
Hey, we got a nibble.

25:29.382 --> 25:31.373
- We got company.
- What?

25:36.322 --> 25:38.313
Oh, no.

25:38.358 --> 25:42.385
I spent half a day's budget
cruising this town looking for you guys.

25:42.429 --> 25:45.159
- How'd you find us?
- Psychic.

25:46.466 --> 25:48.696
- We're taking off.
- Wait for me!

25:58.111 --> 26:01.911
- Rick, he's getting away!
- Do you want me to drive on the sidewalk?

26:01.948 --> 26:05.543
- It'd be tight, but you could try.
- Hell, why not?

26:37.984 --> 26:41.511
<i>Going fishing for Stout
with a Ferrari as bait was a long shot,</i>

26:41.554 --> 26:44.022
<i>a very expensive long shot</i>.

26:44.057 --> 26:47.493
<i>But somehow I just knew
it was gonna click. And it did.</i>

26:47.527 --> 26:49.825
<i>A nibble, we hooked him,</i>

26:49.863 --> 26:52.525
<i>and now all we had to do
was let him run for a while.</i>

26:52.565 --> 26:55.557
<i>Simple, clean, neat</i>.

26:55.602 --> 26:59.663
<i>But that's what being a professional
is all about, right?</i>

27:01.808 --> 27:03.935
Hey! Come on, we're gonna lose him!

27:31.652 --> 27:35.554
So, what's a $60,000 car between friends?
They get lost all the time.

27:35.589 --> 27:38.251
It wasn't lost, T.C., it was stolen.

27:38.292 --> 27:39.953
Uh-huh!

27:41.262 --> 27:43.526
Got a call from Bridget just before we left.

27:43.564 --> 27:46.590
- She called you?
- Looking for you.

27:46.634 --> 27:48.693
Said you was real mean.

27:49.470 --> 27:51.995
Yeah, I kept saying no.

27:52.039 --> 27:55.566
She don't seem like the type
to take no for an answer.

27:56.610 --> 27:58.942
You're right. She's not.

28:00.714 --> 28:03.683
There's nothing back there.

28:04.451 --> 28:07.386
There's also 6,000 feet
of nothing beneath us.

28:07.421 --> 28:12.757
Look, I saw an Intra Pacific Imports truck,
and it was coming or going somewhere.

28:12.793 --> 28:14.818
Where?

28:14.862 --> 28:16.261
Maybe right there.

28:17.064 --> 28:20.056
- Let's go down and take a look.
- The view's fine from here.

28:20.100 --> 28:23.729
Come on, T.C., nothing can go wrong.
Take it down.

28:23.771 --> 28:26.865
"Come on, T.C., nothing can go wrong."

28:26.907 --> 28:31.867
I wish I had a dollar for every time
you said that. It would cover your gas bill!

29:08.749 --> 29:11.240
Nobody's home. Let's go.

29:15.389 --> 29:18.358
Don't bother.
I know what you're going to say.

29:48.022 --> 29:50.013
Hey!

29:54.161 --> 29:58.222
There are about 19 or 20 guys
all over 250 pounds, let's go in.

32:12.566 --> 32:16.332
- What did I tell you?
- Come on, we didn't even get a scratch.

32:25.879 --> 32:30.373
<i>The more I got involved in this case,
the more I wondered why I was doing it.</i>

32:31.151 --> 32:34.951
<i>But I guess it probably had a lot to do
with the way I felt about the Navy,</i>

32:34.988 --> 32:40.949
<i>and my own dad, with things like fair play
and honor thrown in to confuse things.</i>

32:40.994 --> 32:44.395
<i>Not that Bridget wasn't doing
a terrific job of that already.</i>

32:44.431 --> 32:48.299
<i>But at least I'd finally lost her. I hoped</i>.

32:48.335 --> 32:49.666
Yes?

32:49.703 --> 32:52.228
- I'd like to see Mr. Stout.
- Is he expecting you?

32:52.272 --> 32:54.263
- Yes.
- No.

32:55.976 --> 32:59.343
- I'll take care of him.
- Hi. Thomas Magnum.

32:59.379 --> 33:03.509
Listen, I'd really like to chat with you,
but I think I should see Mr. Stout

33:03.550 --> 33:07.316
because I've got
some real personal snapshots for him.

33:14.962 --> 33:17.522
Nice guy. Should have been a maître d'.

33:28.508 --> 33:32.035
You obviously have me
at a disadvantage, Mr...?

33:32.079 --> 33:34.070
Magnum.

33:35.415 --> 33:37.406
Just who and what are you?

33:38.785 --> 33:40.776
I'm a private investigator.

33:42.122 --> 33:44.113
And a photographer?

33:46.026 --> 33:48.586
These don't prove a thing.

33:48.629 --> 33:51.894
Maybe not, but I kind of think
the police will be fascinated.

33:51.932 --> 33:56.232
See, this pretty little red one here?
That's mine.

33:56.270 --> 34:01.264
Actually, it's not mine, but it's
more mine than yours. And... this truck?

34:01.308 --> 34:03.208
That's yours.

34:06.580 --> 34:10.107
I see your point.
You'll have it back this afternoon.

34:10.150 --> 34:13.119
- Now, if that's all...
- It's not.

34:13.152 --> 34:16.554
There was a black market scam
in Honolulu in 1941.

34:17.757 --> 34:20.351
Hundreds of them, probably.

34:20.393 --> 34:24.295
Well, this one involved
a sailor named Miles Archer,

34:24.331 --> 34:28.199
who was set up for a bust
when he found out about one of your deals.

34:29.503 --> 34:32.199
Doesn't ring any bells. Sorry.

34:33.239 --> 34:36.697
OK. I guess
I'll have to make some phone calls.

34:38.378 --> 34:39.811
Uh, Magnum...

34:41.547 --> 34:44.244
I'm starting to hear some jingling.

34:44.284 --> 34:47.719
Archer was a kid that was stuck
between a rock and a hard place.

34:47.754 --> 34:49.585
It was purely business.

34:49.623 --> 34:52.251
And it was 40 years ago.
What does it matter now?

34:52.292 --> 34:54.089
Who set him up?

34:54.127 --> 34:57.426
Couple of sailors
that went down on the Arizona.

34:57.464 --> 34:59.489
What were their names?

35:01.268 --> 35:03.168
What are you doing here?

35:04.137 --> 35:06.162
- Tell him to let her go.
- Let her go.

35:07.240 --> 35:09.231
God!

35:10.210 --> 35:14.613
What was I supposed to do? Wait out there
and miss my chance to talk to Mr. Big?

35:15.382 --> 35:19.876
He was my father and the Navy's
gonna know that he wasn't a crook.

35:19.920 --> 35:23.583
And, yes, I followed you. You know what,
for a P. I., you're pretty easy.

35:23.623 --> 35:25.454
And not very discreet.

35:25.492 --> 35:30.987
- Look, she will not cause you any trouble.
- Oh, I'm sure. But this little chat is over.

35:31.031 --> 35:32.999
- Show them out.
- Just a minute!

35:33.033 --> 35:37.265
Until I get those negatives,
the Ferrari will do nicely as collateral.

35:37.304 --> 35:39.568
- I am not leaving here...
- Say goodbye!

35:39.606 --> 35:42.006
- Goodbye?
- Thank you.

35:43.176 --> 35:46.737
I don't want either of them
opening up the past, do you understand?

35:46.780 --> 35:48.543
I'll take care of it.

36:00.360 --> 36:02.294
- What did he say?
- He said nothing.

36:02.329 --> 36:04.024
- Nothing?
- Nothing!

36:04.064 --> 36:06.259
Come on, what did he say?

36:06.299 --> 36:08.893
Just wait, just wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

36:08.935 --> 36:11.733
Wait! I asked you
to let me handle this, didn't I?

36:11.772 --> 36:13.831
I even said please, didn't I?

36:13.874 --> 36:17.503
You want to handle this?
Then do it, by yourself!

36:19.112 --> 36:22.138
I guess I really put my foot in it again, huh?

36:24.551 --> 36:26.382
You sure as hell did!

36:26.420 --> 36:30.220
If you hadn't come barging in,
I might have got somewhere with this guy.

36:30.257 --> 36:32.384
But you don't listen! You won't...

36:35.929 --> 36:37.021
I'm sorry.

36:39.566 --> 36:44.765
- I'm sorry, I shouldn't have yelled at you.
- Oh, no, I'm sorry, I deserved it.

36:48.408 --> 36:51.844
I'm just always getting myself into trouble.

36:53.980 --> 36:55.971
Sometimes I think I'm cursed.

36:57.484 --> 36:59.475
No, you're not.

37:01.088 --> 37:03.079
You want to bet?

37:05.659 --> 37:07.650
Doesn't that belong to you?

37:12.766 --> 37:15.894
<i>Bridget might have had a point
about the curse.</i>

37:15.936 --> 37:19.872
<i>We were getting nowhere fast,
and running out of leads even faster.</i>

37:19.906 --> 37:23.069
<i>40 years could hide a lot of truth.
And a lot of lies.</i>

37:24.211 --> 37:28.671
<i>So those court-martial transcripts
began to loom up as important.</i>

37:28.715 --> 37:32.742
<i>So I left Bridget where I knew
she couldn't escape, with Rick,</i>

37:32.786 --> 37:36.916
<i>and headed for an understanding heart
and a helping hand.</i>

37:36.957 --> 37:39.118
No, the answer is simply no.

37:39.159 --> 37:41.184
Come on, Lieutenant.

37:41.228 --> 37:44.254
It's just a bunch of boring legal stuff.

37:44.297 --> 37:47.994
No one's even looked at it in 40 years.
Except you.

37:48.034 --> 37:50.025
I'm simply doing my job.

37:50.070 --> 37:52.800
So, did you find anything interesting?

37:52.839 --> 37:56.002
Magnum, I told you,
those transcripts are confidential.

37:56.042 --> 38:02.106
Oh, come on, Maggie. I remember
a dozen times that Mac bent the rules a little.

38:02.949 --> 38:06.146
That's because Lieutenant MacReynolds
was different.

38:06.887 --> 38:11.415
- Very different.
- Yeah. Right.

38:11.458 --> 38:13.722
I could appeal to his heart.

38:13.760 --> 38:16.251
Yeah. And his stomach.

38:16.296 --> 38:20.232
Oh, come on!
That food stuff, that was just an excuse.

38:20.267 --> 38:25.864
Listen, underneath that stomach
was a heart as big as... that stomach.

38:25.906 --> 38:27.271
He cared, Lieutenant.

38:27.307 --> 38:31.073
I know he cared, but rules are rules
and regulations are regulations.

38:31.111 --> 38:33.511
I know that. You're right.

38:33.547 --> 38:37.142
That's exactly what I told Bridget,
that even though you're right,

38:37.184 --> 38:40.711
you can't take advantage of people
because they've got a heart.

38:40.754 --> 38:42.745
That is not fair.

38:45.759 --> 38:50.992
Of course, Mac didn't care about fair
when it came to doing the right thing.

38:55.569 --> 38:57.161
The transcripts are on my desk.

38:57.204 --> 39:01.265
You have 30 minutes, not one second longer.
You tell anyone about this...

39:07.347 --> 39:11.113
<i>30 minutes was about
a half-hour longer than I needed.</i>

39:11.151 --> 39:16.054
<i>The court martial had been open-and-shut.
Miles didn't say 20 words in his defense.</i>

39:16.723 --> 39:20.318
<i>He evidently listened to the young lieutenant
assigned to defend him,</i>

39:20.360 --> 39:24.194
<i>a bright young officer who, in 1942,
was on the way up...</i>

39:25.131 --> 39:28.931
<i>and now...
had made it all the way to the top.</i>

39:41.629 --> 39:44.689
Your request is absolutely preposterous,
Magnum.

39:44.733 --> 39:47.827
Admiral Wheeler is a hero, a living legend.

39:47.869 --> 39:50.929
Some legend! He railroaded my father.

39:50.972 --> 39:53.497
That is a highly personal evaluation that,

39:53.541 --> 39:57.705
given that the incident occurred
before you were born, is totally baseless.

39:57.746 --> 40:01.682
- How do you know what the truth is?
- We don't, damn it!

40:03.184 --> 40:04.845
That's why we want to meet him.

40:04.886 --> 40:08.049
I will not use my personal influence
to arrange a meeting,

40:08.089 --> 40:10.319
especially with the parade about to start.

40:11.459 --> 40:15.259
- Higgins, you seem to be a real horse's...
- Bridget, shut up.

40:18.733 --> 40:21.395
Higgins, look, all we want is five minutes.

40:21.436 --> 40:23.734
That's not much to ask after 40 years.

40:23.772 --> 40:26.138
Magnum, you were a naval officer yourself.

40:26.174 --> 40:29.871
Why pursue an obviously futile exercise
with such determination?

40:30.879 --> 40:33.211
Probably because I was an officer.

40:34.149 --> 40:37.209
I haven't forgotten
what the word duty means.

40:38.019 --> 40:43.787
Remember one thing. Nothing noble
can ever come from tarnishing a hero.

40:46.995 --> 40:49.156
Well... what do you think?

40:49.197 --> 40:54.225
- Think he'll talk to Wheeler?
- He'll do it.

41:32.307 --> 41:35.765
- Five minutes, that's it.
- That should be long enough, sir.

41:35.810 --> 41:39.246
For an incident that happened
more than 40 years ago.

41:39.280 --> 41:41.942
A court martial
is a lot more than an incident.

41:41.983 --> 41:46.511
Since it destroyed Miles Archer's life,
you owe his daughter some answers.

41:46.554 --> 41:49.648
Now, wait... Just a mother-lovin' second.

41:49.691 --> 41:52.956
He doesn't owe me anything.
He owes my dad.

41:55.930 --> 41:57.158
Aiko Tamura.

42:03.138 --> 42:07.006
Why didn't you call her to testify?
She would have come, I know it.

42:07.041 --> 42:10.772
You've forgotten that 1942 was not
a good year for the Japanese in Hawaii.

42:10.812 --> 42:14.680
But wasn't it worth a try?
Wasn't anything worth a try?

42:14.716 --> 42:16.707
It would not have done any good.

42:17.685 --> 42:22.054
We were so angered at the attack,
so bent on avenging our dead,

42:22.090 --> 42:26.993
that no court martial would have listened
to the testimony of a Japanese sweetheart.

42:27.028 --> 42:28.859
Maybe not then, but they would now!

42:28.897 --> 42:32.458
Archer wasn't exactly a hero,
he was AWOL. He admitted it.

42:32.500 --> 42:36.869
Because his girl was sick! It wasn't his fault
the Japanese attacked that morning.

42:36.905 --> 42:42.400
Whatever the reason, he was not
at his duty station when his ship went down!

42:42.443 --> 42:45.173
But he paid for that, sir,
for the rest of his life.

42:45.213 --> 42:48.046
And there were extenuating circumstances.

42:48.082 --> 42:53.486
Most important of all is he's not guilty
of the other charges. Aiko can testify to that.

42:56.658 --> 43:01.152
- The man is dead.
- All he wants is to be buried with his ship.

43:01.196 --> 43:05.428
Is that too much to ask for
after 40 years of punishment,

43:05.466 --> 43:07.832
most of which... he didn't even do?

43:11.873 --> 43:15.274
You could reopen the case, Admiral.
Aiko could testify.

43:15.310 --> 43:18.609
- So could you.
- Do you know what you're asking?

43:18.646 --> 43:23.379
It's not just dusting off books, looking at
a court martial everyone's forgotten about.

43:23.418 --> 43:25.545
Not everyone, Admiral.

43:25.587 --> 43:28.715
Nothing is the same now.

43:28.756 --> 43:33.591
No one would understand how people felt,
why they did things, how they did them.

43:33.628 --> 43:38.964
I have a reputation and name to think about.
I have 45 good years in the Navy.

43:39.500 --> 43:43.368
All of that is a hell of a lot more
than my dad ever had.

43:47.175 --> 43:51.976
Admiral, you're being honored today
as a man of courage and integrity.

43:54.515 --> 43:57.916
I guess you're the only one
who knows for sure.

44:14.068 --> 44:16.059
Bridget...

44:18.940 --> 44:21.306
This was so stupid.

44:21.342 --> 44:23.742
- No, it wasn't.
- The hell it wasn't!

44:25.346 --> 44:29.282
A barmaid from Cleveland
squaring off against the Navy...

44:32.654 --> 44:37.114
Oh, God... that's a good one.

44:38.893 --> 44:41.361
Drive me back to my motel, Magnum.

44:44.198 --> 44:46.928
I want to pick up Dad and go back home.

44:55.143 --> 44:57.668
- Look, why don't we talk...
- Come on.

45:02.950 --> 45:05.783
You go for Stout, I'll kick the big guy in the...

45:05.820 --> 45:09.449
Right, and get us both killed?
Let's just see what he has to say.

45:16.998 --> 45:21.492
I liked you, Magnum. I liked your moxie.
Kind of liked hers, too.

45:22.737 --> 45:24.568
But I thought we had an understanding.

45:24.605 --> 45:28.371
- How come he keeps saying "liked"?
- Will you shut up? For once?

45:29.243 --> 45:35.512
That's good advice, but a little late. You both
talk too much and to the wrong people!

45:35.550 --> 45:38.849
Yeah, well, I was never much
on keeping my mouth shut.

45:44.392 --> 45:46.257
Well, help!

45:46.294 --> 45:49.161
You behave or she'll get mad at you too.
Give me that!

45:49.831 --> 45:52.857
- I told you not to do that!
- You're gonna complain now?

45:52.900 --> 45:56.358
- It worked, didn't it?
- Well, what if it didn't?

45:56.404 --> 45:59.896
Please! Don't we need a cop or an MP?

45:59.941 --> 46:05.743
In the Navy we call them SPs, Miss Archer.
And I think we can help you find one.

46:06.814 --> 46:10.250
As well as I think we can help you
solve your other problems.

46:21.129 --> 46:24.656
<i>There really are some stories
with happy endings.</i>

46:24.699 --> 46:30.194
<i>Of course, Higgins got the Ferrari back.
And Bridget Archer, something else.</i>

46:30.238 --> 46:33.298
<i>Something she could take back
with her to Cleveland.</i>

46:33.341 --> 46:36.606
<i>Pride in her father, and herself</i>.

46:41.149 --> 46:43.049
Ready...

46:44.085 --> 46:45.950
Aim...

46:45.987 --> 46:47.284
Fire!

46:51.092 --> 46:54.459
Aim... fire!

46:55.263 --> 46:57.959
Aim... fire!

47:09.610 --> 47:12.443
Present... arms!
