NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:03.211 --> 00:05.338
I was, like, in the middle of a crisis.

00:05.422 --> 00:08.299
Robin and me are back,
and you're acting all jealous.

00:08.383 --> 00:09.384
-Of what?
-Robin.

00:09.467 --> 00:10.301
Don't flatter yourself.

00:10.677 --> 00:12.637
What if I took her for a test-spin?

00:12.721 --> 00:14.556
You, uh... You mean a solo drive?

00:14.639 --> 00:17.684
You mean you just let some guy
just drive off in your bus like that?

00:17.767 --> 00:19.269
Gina, what do you say we go out

00:19.352 --> 00:22.147
and have a nice,
quiet victory celebration?

00:22.230 --> 00:24.482
Henry and I are going to the Red Lion.

00:26.109 --> 00:28.069
-(chattering)
-STAN: Item ten.

00:28.820 --> 00:31.114
Lieutenant Hunter's motor home
was stolen yesterday.

00:31.197 --> 00:32.741
(murmuring)

00:32.824 --> 00:36.244
The lieutenant has asked me to emphasize
he doesn't want this handled any different

00:36.327 --> 00:38.121
than any other grand theft auto.

00:38.204 --> 00:41.374
-Meaning he never wants to see it again.
-(laughter)

00:42.000 --> 00:44.127
STAN: Uh, BCI shows a want on the perp.

00:44.210 --> 00:45.920
He's a white male, mid-30s,

00:46.004 --> 00:49.549
goes by the name Lawrence McKeever,
real name, Lonny Stone.

00:49.632 --> 00:53.261
He's wanted in Massachusetts
for snatching his son, age six,

00:53.344 --> 00:56.598
named, uh, Christopher,
on a custody dispute.

00:56.931 --> 01:00.727
The guy's been leapfrogging the country
ever since in stolen vehicles.

01:00.810 --> 01:05.106
Complete description upstairs.
Now, item 11; assignments.

01:05.190 --> 01:08.068
Officer Coffey is released
from normal tour today.

01:08.401 --> 01:10.695
He's going to be attending
a lecture and a training session

01:10.779 --> 01:12.906
with Sergeant Kass of the K9 corps.

01:12.989 --> 01:13.990
(crowd barking)

01:14.074 --> 01:16.367
That means, uh,
Officer Buzhardt's gonna ride

01:16.451 --> 01:18.078
with Sergeant Bates again today.

01:18.161 --> 01:21.081
All right! Women! Women! Women!

01:21.164 --> 01:25.085
Captain Furillo today
is on a command retreat downtown

01:25.168 --> 01:26.252
at the Hotel Marquis.

01:26.336 --> 01:30.840
In his absence, Lieutenant Calletano
has assumed station command.

01:30.924 --> 01:34.969
-(mimics Ray) Captain Marvel!
-(laughter)

01:35.053 --> 01:36.846
Now, last item...

01:38.306 --> 01:40.975
last item is from Division,

01:42.352 --> 01:44.270
who would like us to know...

01:45.563 --> 01:47.148
overtime is back.

01:47.232 --> 01:51.069
-(all cheering)
-Just call me "Double Shift" Hill!

01:51.152 --> 01:55.865
(cheering, applauding)

01:56.282 --> 01:58.284
So, we got these balmy temperatures.

01:58.368 --> 02:01.246
We got the prospect of a few
more bucks in our pocketbook.

02:01.329 --> 02:03.498
Let's ride that good feeling.
Let's get out there--

02:03.581 --> 02:05.792
Let's do it to them
before they do it to us.

02:05.875 --> 02:10.130
(cheering, applauding)

02:11.798 --> 02:13.925
(chairs scraping)

02:14.008 --> 02:15.760
(telephone ringing)

02:16.928 --> 02:19.931
-Officer Coffey, right? Sergeant Kass.
-Nice to meet you.

02:20.014 --> 02:22.350
Now, I got Ginger here and Baron.

02:22.433 --> 02:24.269
-(chain clangs)
-Oh, boy. (chuckles)

02:24.978 --> 02:27.272
So, you guys gonna be nice to me
on my first day or what?

02:27.355 --> 02:29.065
Here you go, good manners. Shake hands.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.109
Where's your manners?
Come on, shake. (snap fingers)

02:31.192 --> 02:32.360
There you go.

02:32.443 --> 02:33.653
Baron's new, too. Don't worry.

02:33.736 --> 02:34.779
-I got him from Customs.
-(dog barking)

02:34.863 --> 02:36.072
-Great.
-Let's go.

02:38.366 --> 02:39.993
Good morning, Stan, Howard.

02:40.076 --> 02:42.328
-Ray.
-Lieutenant Goldblume wasn't at home.

02:42.745 --> 02:45.915
You started without me,
but I'll forgive you.

02:46.833 --> 02:48.626
I have planned no major shake-ups.

02:48.877 --> 02:51.004
Stan to squad room, Howard, EATers,
Henry, you'll--

02:51.087 --> 02:54.215
Uh, I have a lunch today, Ray.

02:57.302 --> 03:00.138
No problem. I'll cover for you, old sport.

03:00.430 --> 03:01.431
Good, Howard

03:01.848 --> 03:03.641
I appreciate the extra pitching in.

03:03.933 --> 03:06.060
Well, let's have a good shift.

03:07.729 --> 03:08.563
Yeah.

03:13.818 --> 03:16.821
Oh, Frank, your retreat has been canceled?

03:16.905 --> 03:18.823
No, no, no. You're still in command, Ray.

03:19.616 --> 03:22.660
I just thought I'd take some
paperwork along in case there's a break.

03:23.286 --> 03:25.872
Maybe if I get lucky,
somebody will phone in an emergency.

03:26.539 --> 03:28.374
Looks good. You don't mind?

03:29.042 --> 03:30.501
It's entirely appropriate.

03:31.044 --> 03:31.878
Thanks.

03:47.268 --> 03:49.687
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

03:50.188 --> 03:51.856
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

03:51.940 --> 03:55.860
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

03:55.944 --> 03:57.445
(sirens wailing)

04:02.909 --> 04:05.536
(theme music playing)

05:07.515 --> 05:08.558
RAY:<i> How you doing, guys?</i>

05:08.641 --> 05:09.642
Just swell, sir.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.686
I see you're drinking some of Rosa's tea.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.355
That's Rosa's? That's nice.

05:14.439 --> 05:16.899
I thought, "Why shouldn't
we have a choice?"

05:16.983 --> 05:18.026
BOBBY: Thanks, Lieutenant.

05:18.109 --> 05:19.360
Any problems today?

05:20.069 --> 05:23.406
-Because if you do have any problems--
-(hoarsely) It's this damn sore throat.

05:24.032 --> 05:25.867
-Tea.
-BOBBY: Right.

05:25.950 --> 05:26.784
I'm here.

05:27.577 --> 05:28.953
My office door is open.

05:31.122 --> 05:35.043
Can you imagine if that<i> hombre</i>
becomes a full-fledged<i> capitano?</i>

05:35.293 --> 05:37.128
(mimics Ray)
I know you have some problems.

05:37.211 --> 05:39.714
That's why my door is always open.

05:39.797 --> 05:42.717
Ugh! Just give the man a chance, Renko.
He's a little nervous.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.344
(in normal voice) This tea is bitter.

05:44.427 --> 05:45.595
It's good for you.

05:47.263 --> 05:49.140
-Hi.
-Hi.

05:49.599 --> 05:50.850
What are you doing here?

05:50.933 --> 05:52.518
You forgot your lunch this morning.

05:52.769 --> 05:54.437
I was gonna eat at the diner.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.856
Oh, and you also forgot
your dry-cleaning ticket.

05:56.939 --> 05:59.192
Stuff's not ready until tomorrow.

05:59.275 --> 06:02.195
-I know. I just wanted to see you.
-(chuckles)

06:02.653 --> 06:05.740
Hey, Sarge, what do you say?
Change your mind about dinner tonight?

06:05.823 --> 06:07.950
Can't. Bowling.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.702
You won't believe
a nice Italian girl like me

06:09.786 --> 06:11.829
could make
one of the world's great kielbasas.

06:11.913 --> 06:14.457
Bowling league's
not until tomorrow night, Sergeant.

06:14.916 --> 06:16.334
I'm gonna redrill my ball.

06:16.417 --> 06:17.960
So, another time, maybe?

06:18.961 --> 06:19.796
Yeah.

06:19.879 --> 06:21.005
I gotta go.

06:21.589 --> 06:22.465
I love you.

06:33.976 --> 06:36.521
How goes the loneliness of command, Ray?

06:36.854 --> 06:38.981
So far, so good, Lieutenant.

06:41.109 --> 06:43.444
You look terrible. Oversleep?

06:44.070 --> 06:44.904
Uh-uh.

06:45.863 --> 06:46.697
No sleep.

06:52.203 --> 06:53.955
I have never in my life...

06:54.747 --> 06:55.581
ever

06:56.290 --> 06:58.459
spent a night like I spent last night.

06:58.793 --> 07:00.294
You sound like a man in love.

07:00.586 --> 07:02.130
I never thought of myself as a lover,

07:02.213 --> 07:07.927
but last night this woman
rotated me 180 degrees.

07:08.010 --> 07:10.054
I am deeply...

07:10.763 --> 07:12.473
physically, emotionally...

07:14.517 --> 07:16.769
physically... in love.

07:17.228 --> 07:19.188
It's like a building fell on me.

07:19.522 --> 07:21.065
Hmm, I know what you mean.

07:21.607 --> 07:26.112
Even after 22 years,
every time Rosa and I make love,

07:26.737 --> 07:30.074
it's like a building falling on me, too.

07:30.408 --> 07:31.742
I'm happy for you.

07:33.453 --> 07:34.287
Thanks, Ray.

07:34.579 --> 07:36.372
If you want to talk, I'm free for lunch.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.458
I got a date, remember?

07:39.083 --> 07:42.753
But if an emergency comes up,
you can find me at the Hotel Wellington.

07:42.837 --> 07:44.088
(door opens, closes)

07:47.633 --> 07:48.801
(door slams)

07:49.177 --> 07:50.553
We're gonna be throwing the spotlight

07:50.636 --> 07:52.680
on a lot of things
you've been keeping buried,

07:53.264 --> 07:55.641
resentments, animosities
that have built up,

07:56.142 --> 07:58.936
maybe some things you haven't
even admitted to yourself yet.

07:59.645 --> 08:01.397
Now, there are some ground rules.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.441
Number one, there is no violence.

08:03.816 --> 08:05.651
-You can yell, you can scream.
-(chuckles)

08:06.402 --> 08:07.737
But if you strike another guy, you're out.

08:08.529 --> 08:11.574
Two, there's no rank here.
We're all equals.

08:11.657 --> 08:13.784
We're on a first-name basis.
That's number three.

08:13.868 --> 08:15.244
(in low voice) This is ridiculous.

08:15.620 --> 08:18.039
So, I'm Mike.

08:18.122 --> 08:20.374
Uh... and you're?

08:20.875 --> 08:23.002
-(mouths)
-I didn't hear that.

08:23.544 --> 08:24.837
Warren.

08:26.380 --> 08:27.882
Are you uncomfortable, Warren?

08:28.424 --> 08:30.218
Would you like to take off
your coat and tie?

08:30.301 --> 08:32.053
(scoffs) What is that,
part of the rules or what?

08:32.136 --> 08:34.096
No, I'm just saying you can
if you want to.

08:42.730 --> 08:45.399
Oh, and there's no hardware here.
You're not gonna need it,

08:45.733 --> 08:47.818
although at times
you may feel like you do.

08:48.861 --> 08:49.779
(guns thud)

08:55.952 --> 08:57.703
(police siren wailing)

08:57.787 --> 08:59.455
(tires screech)

09:01.958 --> 09:03.918
(chattering)

09:20.434 --> 09:21.978
What can I do for you?

09:23.938 --> 09:24.814
Officer...

09:25.773 --> 09:26.774
Yes?

09:28.776 --> 09:29.777
(stutters) I ran a light.

09:29.860 --> 09:34.323
I thought if I stopped too fast
I might lose control of the car.

09:34.574 --> 09:35.616
RENKO: Uh-huh.

09:37.451 --> 09:38.744
Anything else, officer?

09:40.121 --> 09:43.916
Well, I think you might
get that steering wheel checked out

09:44.000 --> 09:46.877
-before it melts on you completely.
-Huh?

09:46.961 --> 09:49.297
-(chuckles)
-Nothing, nothing.

09:51.257 --> 09:54.093
Um, license and registrations, man.

09:58.055 --> 09:59.181
(sighs)

10:01.183 --> 10:05.062
-Paul Stover? Is that you?
-Yes, sir.

10:05.479 --> 10:06.480
RENKO: Hmm.

10:08.524 --> 10:09.900
Is this your Stove, Mr. Car?

10:11.819 --> 10:12.945
-Bobby...
-Yes, sir.

10:14.572 --> 10:15.573
Hmm?

10:17.825 --> 10:20.745
-I know.
-(both laughing)

10:27.835 --> 10:30.379
Well, Mr. Stover, the good news,

10:30.463 --> 10:32.590
we're gonna let you go
with a warning today.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.801
The other good news
is that you win an award

10:35.885 --> 10:40.431
for having the ugliest driver's license
I ever saw in my life!

10:40.514 --> 10:42.516
-(both laughing)
-This picture, man--

10:42.600 --> 10:46.896
You are allowed to wear your false teeth
when you have them pictures taken.

10:46.979 --> 10:49.357
(laughter)

10:50.316 --> 10:52.068
I forgot them that day.

10:52.151 --> 10:54.445
Forgot them that day. You're all right.

10:54.862 --> 10:56.489
Just a moment, sir.

10:56.572 --> 10:59.784
(both laughing)

11:01.077 --> 11:06.123
You know what?
I am about to just fall out, man.

11:06.207 --> 11:07.416
Me, too.

11:07.833 --> 11:09.919
(laughter continues)

11:14.256 --> 11:16.050
He looked like Mister Ed.

11:16.133 --> 11:18.302
(both laughing)

11:22.264 --> 11:24.266
-Bobby...
-Huh?

11:24.892 --> 11:26.936
I feel strange.

11:27.019 --> 11:31.649
I feel like someone has
perpetrated something on us.

11:33.484 --> 11:36.070
And I am certain
that I am under the influence

11:36.654 --> 11:38.739
of some illegal substance.

11:41.784 --> 11:42.743
Yeah.

11:43.327 --> 11:44.662
Strange.

11:50.251 --> 11:51.210
Bobby...

11:52.628 --> 11:54.213
Did I ever tell you

11:55.089 --> 11:58.509
that I consider you
to be the brother I never had?

11:59.051 --> 12:01.387
Renko, you have a brother.

12:01.637 --> 12:02.471
I know.

12:03.639 --> 12:06.267
But sometimes I feel that...

12:08.269 --> 12:10.146
you are me,

12:11.313 --> 12:14.525
that... I'm over here

12:15.484 --> 12:16.777
and you're over there.

12:17.361 --> 12:18.487
You are me.

12:20.948 --> 12:23.659
I love you, my brother.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

12:23.743 --> 12:24.577
I love you.

12:25.327 --> 12:28.247
-Uh...
-That's what I'm trying to tell you.

12:28.330 --> 12:30.124
Vice versa, Andy.

12:30.207 --> 12:33.210
-Vice versa, man. Ooh.
-I know.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.509
Can I get my license back?

12:40.926 --> 12:41.969
Who are you?

12:53.564 --> 12:55.065
Okay, clamps are on.

12:55.149 --> 12:56.734
MAN: Bear with us, please.

12:58.235 --> 13:02.698
I... I stalled out, officers.
We're just about hooked up.

13:02.782 --> 13:06.327
-Nice going stopping in the driving lane.
-It's the only way I could get close.

13:06.410 --> 13:08.621
Look, you're jamming traffic.
Get it moved.

13:09.121 --> 13:11.248
Jeez, we're almost hooked up.
Could he just take it--

13:11.332 --> 13:13.000
Get it moved or get it cited, pal.

13:14.710 --> 13:18.547
Officer Buzhardt,
check your item ten roll call.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.508
Sight. Give me a position, please.

13:21.133 --> 13:22.009
(thuds)

13:22.802 --> 13:25.805
-Hey!
-Okay, no mistakes now!

13:25.888 --> 13:28.307
-Don't make me do something.
-Just take it easy.

13:28.390 --> 13:31.143
-Take it real easy.
-Yeah, we'll all take it easy.

13:31.936 --> 13:35.105
We all just recognized each other.
Open the door, Chris!

13:35.648 --> 13:37.775
We're going inside, Buzhardt.
You're going inside with us.

13:37.858 --> 13:39.026
Okay, okay, just don't kill me!

13:39.109 --> 13:41.779
-I'm not gonna kill you. Come on.
-Hey, hey, I got an idea.

13:41.862 --> 13:44.156
Nobody's been hurt. The kid's there...

13:44.240 --> 13:46.492
Just put that gun down,
and we'll work it out. What do you say?

13:46.575 --> 13:48.953
I'm with you, lady.
Give me someone to talk to.

13:49.036 --> 13:50.371
We'll work it all out.

13:50.454 --> 13:52.540
Get the door. Get the door.

13:52.998 --> 13:54.166
Get the windows, Chris!

13:55.084 --> 13:57.378
(train rumbling)

13:57.461 --> 13:59.380
(police sirens wailing)

13:59.463 --> 14:02.925
-(tires screeching)
-(helicopter whirring)

14:03.008 --> 14:04.927
MAN: Bomb squad, get in position.

14:06.512 --> 14:08.055
How are we doing, folks?

14:10.057 --> 14:11.767
Got me someone to talk to?

14:12.268 --> 14:13.519
Mr. Stone?

14:15.020 --> 14:16.814
It's Lieutenant Howard Hunter.

14:17.982 --> 14:19.149
Are you kidding me?!

14:19.233 --> 14:20.693
Not on your life.

14:21.735 --> 14:24.446
A little late getting back
from my test-drive.

14:24.530 --> 14:26.532
<i>The hell with the vehicle, Mr. Stone.</i>

14:27.157 --> 14:31.161
I was hoping we could negotiate
a safe conclusion to this situation.

14:32.162 --> 14:35.624
How's your boy and Officer Buzhardt?

14:36.542 --> 14:38.168
Everyone's hunky-dory.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.463
No offense, Lieutenant.

14:42.673 --> 14:44.633
Have you got the weight to make a deal?

14:44.717 --> 14:48.679
I have full authorization
to hear your request.

14:48.762 --> 14:51.640
That's real clever
how you put that, Lieutenant,

14:51.724 --> 14:54.184
so in case you think
we're gonna be dancing around

14:54.268 --> 14:58.272
with word games like that,
I want you to listen to somebody.

15:03.611 --> 15:05.070
Look, he's not kidding.

15:05.404 --> 15:08.782
He's gonna give you a real list,
and he wants answers right away.

15:08.866 --> 15:09.992
He's not kidding!

15:13.704 --> 15:15.039
(inhales deeply)

15:15.456 --> 15:16.790
Okay, Lieutenant?

15:17.666 --> 15:22.546
So let's not dish out the crapola
with your "allowed to hear what I want."

15:22.922 --> 15:24.757
I'm gonna throw out this list.

15:24.840 --> 15:27.551
If you can't give me answers,
you read it to whoever can.

15:27.635 --> 15:29.011
Then I want to hear from you.

15:29.553 --> 15:31.263
Okay, here comes the list.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.728
A little slower, Howard, please.

15:38.312 --> 15:41.482
A twin-engine seaplane.

15:41.565 --> 15:44.109
Raymondo, there is no way
in God's green earth

15:44.193 --> 15:47.571
that we are going to accede
to those demands. Judas Priest.

15:47.655 --> 15:50.741
-Why are you writing them down?
<i>-To have a record.</i>

15:50.824 --> 15:53.243
We have warrants
from seven different states.

15:53.327 --> 15:57.915
We've also heard from Massachusetts,
and his ex-wife is flying here,

15:57.998 --> 16:00.584
<i>though I don't think</i>
<i>we want him to know that.</i>

16:00.876 --> 16:01.919
Are you sure, Ray?

16:02.252 --> 16:04.588
I mean, the only dents
we seem to make in it

16:05.255 --> 16:07.091
are on the subject of his boy's welfare.

16:07.174 --> 16:08.592
Use your judgment.

16:08.676 --> 16:11.303
But remember, this man kidnapped his son.

16:11.845 --> 16:13.973
He may not think kindly of the mother.

16:14.306 --> 16:15.683
<i>How is Buzhardt?</i>

16:16.517 --> 16:18.435
Uh, she's a little frayed at the edges.

16:19.520 --> 16:20.396
(clicks tongue)

16:20.479 --> 16:23.816
Listen, I didn't mean
to snap at you before, old sport.

16:23.899 --> 16:24.984
<i>That's all right, Howard</i>

16:25.067 --> 16:26.151
Frequent contact.

16:26.735 --> 16:28.988
-HARRY: What do you call it, then?
-I call it people being adult

16:29.071 --> 16:30.614
and going out
with who they want to go out with.

16:30.698 --> 16:31.824
Yeah, I call it stealing.

16:31.907 --> 16:34.076
Plus, he comes in this morning--
Is he man enough to tell me?

16:34.159 --> 16:35.202
No. He tells Calletano.

16:35.285 --> 16:37.788
-You're a child. Yes.
-I'm a child?

16:38.747 --> 16:40.874
You're right. I'm acting like a jerk.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.794
If the woman doesn't want me,
it's not Goldblume's fault.

16:44.211 --> 16:47.339
Harry, there's lots of women out there
who'd like to date you.

16:48.507 --> 16:50.634
You, uh... You one of them, Pats?

16:51.635 --> 16:56.265
Nice. Someone else loads your gun,
you want me to pull the trigger.

17:00.185 --> 17:01.103
GINA: Who is it?

17:02.479 --> 17:04.273
It's the police, ma'am. Open up.

17:05.399 --> 17:07.234
Is anybody else out there?

17:08.485 --> 17:09.570
No, ma'am, just me.

17:12.406 --> 17:13.615
Hi, Henry.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.745
Holy moly.

17:17.828 --> 17:18.871
Like it?

17:19.663 --> 17:21.832
"Like" doesn't begin to describe it.

17:21.915 --> 17:23.375
(clangs)

17:23.459 --> 17:24.793
Hmm.

17:25.252 --> 17:28.047
Maybe you better... come inside.

17:28.505 --> 17:29.548
(chuckles softly)

17:41.435 --> 17:43.187
Ever since you left this morning,

17:43.270 --> 17:46.398
I haven't been able to think
of anything else but you.

17:46.482 --> 17:47.357
Me either.

17:48.150 --> 17:50.819
I can't keep my hands off of you.

17:51.487 --> 17:52.446
I admire that in a woman.

17:52.529 --> 17:55.074
And it's not just sex, either,

17:55.574 --> 18:00.746
not that the sex isn't incredible,
because it is with you,

18:00.829 --> 18:03.624
but it's deeper than sex.

18:03.874 --> 18:07.753
It's like... we're fused.

18:09.129 --> 18:10.005
I know.

18:10.547 --> 18:11.465
Henry...

18:13.675 --> 18:14.510
What?

18:15.302 --> 18:16.595
I want you...

18:17.471 --> 18:18.472
today...

18:19.932 --> 18:20.974
tomorrow...

18:22.476 --> 18:23.519
forever.

18:25.354 --> 18:29.066
I want to make you happy
in every conceivable way.

18:31.610 --> 18:34.530
I totally, totally love you.

18:37.533 --> 18:41.370
So... there I was,
thinking I'd get a beating.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.956
Well, I had a black eye.

18:44.873 --> 18:47.167
Maybe I was more scared
she'd start thrashing me, too,

18:47.251 --> 18:48.836
for going to that playground.

18:49.711 --> 18:52.840
But the thing Mom told me that day
has stayed with me all my life.

18:53.507 --> 18:56.844
"Fletcher, it's not
the size of the dog in the fight,

18:56.927 --> 18:59.555
it's the size of the fight in the dog."

18:59.638 --> 19:00.681
Oh, please.

19:00.764 --> 19:01.932
The men know that

19:02.015 --> 19:04.685
that I'm a battler in my struggles
for their welfare.

19:05.644 --> 19:07.187
I may ruffle a few feathers along the way.

19:07.271 --> 19:09.148
I'm not always a perfect gentleman.

19:09.398 --> 19:11.984
But dammit,
when you've got Daniels in your corner,

19:12.067 --> 19:14.111
you've got him for all 15 rounds.

19:14.194 --> 19:15.154
Excuse me.

19:16.363 --> 19:18.532
-Where are you going?
-It's killing me.

19:18.615 --> 19:19.908
I can't stand it anymore.

19:20.576 --> 19:22.244
You got something you want
to tell me, Joe Daley?

19:22.327 --> 19:26.498
Yeah. You're here talking all this time
how the men respect you,

19:26.582 --> 19:27.958
they know you're on their side.

19:28.041 --> 19:30.794
You haven't the faintest idea
what these cops think.

19:31.753 --> 19:33.255
Suppose you tell me.

19:33.672 --> 19:36.967
They think all you're concerned
about is your image.

19:37.050 --> 19:38.969
You couldn't care less about them.

19:39.052 --> 19:40.345
That's not fair.

19:40.429 --> 19:41.263
You were gonna clean things up.

19:41.346 --> 19:43.724
The department has more rat holes
than the North Street Bridge.

19:43.807 --> 19:46.476
I've done everything in my power
to eradicate corruption.

19:46.560 --> 19:47.978
No, you haven't, Chief.

19:48.353 --> 19:50.439
When push came to shove,
it was what Joe said,

19:50.522 --> 19:53.734
you were more concerned with the
department's image than with its honesty.

19:53.817 --> 19:55.360
<i>Et tu, </i>Frank?

19:55.736 --> 20:00.908
Stan Mizell, Tony Marino, Jerry Fuchs,
Joe Keenan's still getting a paycheck.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.660
Who else?! Huh?

20:04.828 --> 20:06.455
Who else hates my guts?

20:07.289 --> 20:08.874
-I can't eat this.
-(plate clangs)

20:08.957 --> 20:10.125
Where's the milk I asked for?

20:11.251 --> 20:12.127
Ulcer, Joe?

20:12.419 --> 20:14.463
You know when I got it?
When he took over the department.

20:16.173 --> 20:18.926
Fletcher, how do you feel right now?

20:19.384 --> 20:23.680
Oh, in a day of rancid stupidities,
that question takes the cake.

20:24.348 --> 20:25.307
How do you feel?

20:25.891 --> 20:29.144
-Like I'm being savaged by a pack of dogs.
-There you go.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.395
That's what he thinks of us.

20:30.479 --> 20:32.439
Why don't you check your watch, Joe?

20:33.607 --> 20:36.568
Not every man has the privilege to know
to the exact second

20:36.652 --> 20:37.736
when his career ended.

20:37.819 --> 20:39.321
-You're out of line.
-Hey!

20:39.404 --> 20:42.032
My career ended
the day he took over the department.

20:42.115 --> 20:43.909
Fair enough. No, that's fair.

20:44.785 --> 20:46.078
You know why, Mike?

20:46.912 --> 20:50.499
I got a snoot detector for mediocrity.
He<i> was </i>finished when I came in.

20:50.916 --> 20:52.584
JOE: And don't think I didn't know it,

20:52.668 --> 20:54.920
and don't think it didn't hurt
that I worked that way!

20:55.003 --> 20:56.463
So what are you gonna do now, Fletch?

20:56.546 --> 20:58.715
You gonna bury me in a desk somewhere?

20:58.799 --> 21:00.926
So what? I got 18 years in.

21:01.009 --> 21:02.844
Two more years and I'm out from under.

21:02.928 --> 21:05.013
How is cooping in a desk
gonna be any different

21:05.097 --> 21:06.848
from how you've run the Ferry? Huh, Joe?

21:07.432 --> 21:10.936
Guy's got more deadwood in his squad room
than any other three captains.

21:11.019 --> 21:15.357
Joe's idea of a personnel decision
is hoping the man gets a back problem.

21:15.440 --> 21:18.902
MIKE: Fletcher, if you could let go
of your anger for just a minute,

21:19.987 --> 21:23.073
I think you'd hear Joe trying to tell you
something very important.

21:23.865 --> 21:24.950
He's telling you

21:25.617 --> 21:27.744
that he's a non-functioning cop.

21:27.828 --> 21:31.581
He's marking his time
with no commitment to the future, no hope.

21:31.665 --> 21:33.542
Oh, you're breaking my heart!

21:33.625 --> 21:34.793
Listen to what's being said.

21:34.876 --> 21:37.587
MIKE: Now, I can't judge
the validity of his allegations,

21:37.671 --> 21:39.673
but I can validate that man's pain.

21:40.841 --> 21:43.343
And the way he shut himself down
just to survive.

21:43.427 --> 21:45.637
And that hurts everybody. That hurts you.

21:46.179 --> 21:47.514
-(exhales)
-That hurts Joe.

21:48.473 --> 21:50.600
But most of all, it hurts the department

21:51.018 --> 21:53.937
because Joe's frustrations
just can't be his.

21:55.272 --> 21:57.232
They're symptomatic of something larger,

21:59.192 --> 22:00.569
and it ought to be looked at...

22:02.446 --> 22:03.363
with some care...

22:05.949 --> 22:07.242
by every one of you here.

22:17.210 --> 22:22.049
I wish I could give you
something more definitive, Mr. Stone.

22:22.758 --> 22:26.428
Uh, we haven't gotten "nos"
and we haven't gotten "yeses."

22:26.511 --> 22:29.723
-What we have are a bunch of "maybes."
-(scoffs)

22:30.724 --> 22:33.643
We ain't gonna get squat, Mr. Christopher.

22:33.727 --> 22:34.895
Well, how do you know?

22:34.978 --> 22:37.731
Maybe he really hasn't gotten
any answers yet.

22:38.190 --> 22:41.234
HOWARD:<i> Mr. Stone,</i>
<i>if we can just be patient...</i>

22:42.778 --> 22:44.863
They're gonna try to wear Father down.

22:46.156 --> 22:48.116
They're gonna keep talking to Father,

22:48.658 --> 22:51.119
giving him the hip, taking it away.

22:52.287 --> 22:54.164
It's gonna be a lot like life.

22:56.041 --> 22:57.209
Mr. Stone...

22:57.292 --> 22:58.960
-(sighs)
-Mr. Stone...

22:59.044 --> 23:00.379
Sorry, Janie.

23:04.383 --> 23:05.509
<i>Mr. Stone...</i>

23:08.845 --> 23:09.679
Yeah.

23:10.180 --> 23:13.809
Thanks for the insult
to my intelligence, Lieutenant.

23:14.351 --> 23:17.813
I figure this is probably
a low-priority item,

23:17.896 --> 23:20.482
what with a cop and kid being hostage.

23:20.565 --> 23:23.693
You probably haven't
been able to get through to anyone.

23:23.777 --> 23:25.695
I've gotten through, Mr. Stone.

23:26.238 --> 23:28.407
I just don't have any definitive answers.

23:28.490 --> 23:31.701
We're gonna do this
front to back, huh, Lieutenant?

23:32.452 --> 23:35.372
We started lying to each other
about this motor home.

23:35.455 --> 23:37.999
We're gonna keep it up
until you blow me away.

23:40.544 --> 23:42.629
That doesn't have to happen, Mr. Stone.

23:48.176 --> 23:50.137
Why don't you send your son out, sir?

23:56.393 --> 23:57.227
Close it.

24:05.152 --> 24:07.362
I kept it up as long as I could, son.

24:08.989 --> 24:10.824
I can't see any way now.

24:10.907 --> 24:12.701
But I don't want to go.

24:13.326 --> 24:14.870
You've got to, Christopher.

24:16.246 --> 24:18.039
Now you gotta go it alone.

24:19.624 --> 24:21.543
Just remember all of it, all right?

24:22.419 --> 24:25.338
When they tell you what it was
and what it wasn't,

24:26.256 --> 24:27.674
you remember all of it.

24:29.926 --> 24:30.844
Come here.

24:35.098 --> 24:36.516
Someone coming!

24:48.904 --> 24:49.738
So long.

24:50.906 --> 24:51.907
So long, Dad.

24:53.658 --> 24:54.618
I love you.

25:04.461 --> 25:05.295
(trailer door opens)

25:05.921 --> 25:07.047
MAN: Trailer door open.

25:08.256 --> 25:09.883
MAN: All right.
It's the kid. It's the kid.

25:23.647 --> 25:25.732
COP 1: Stay back, stay back, stay back.

25:26.816 --> 25:27.984
COP 2: Holding position.

25:41.540 --> 25:45.794
Mr. Stone, an officer is gonna pull up
with your car now.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.588
Do I gotta say, "May I"? Let's go!

25:49.005 --> 25:51.591
<i>It's coming.</i>
<i>The car will be in position shortly...</i>

25:51.925 --> 25:52.968
Listen.

25:54.469 --> 25:57.806
We can both get out.
We can still both get out.

25:58.181 --> 25:59.808
We are both getting out--

26:00.767 --> 26:01.726
Canada.

26:02.936 --> 26:07.190
Crisp days... very crisp nights.

26:07.983 --> 26:11.069
Listen, they're not gonna
let you out of here.

26:11.486 --> 26:14.531
You're a smart guy. You gotta know
they're not gonna let you leave.

26:14.614 --> 26:16.491
HOWARD:
<i>Officer Buzhardt? Officer Buzhardt!</i>

26:16.575 --> 26:18.785
Here's what I hope it's like...

26:19.661 --> 26:21.079
going to the doctor.

26:21.997 --> 26:24.457
"Here comes the doctor. Close your eyes."

26:24.541 --> 26:26.293
(screams)

26:26.376 --> 26:29.337
You make a loud noise in your head,
and you think of something till it's over.

26:31.756 --> 26:32.674
Then it's over.

26:34.759 --> 26:35.760
You got through it.

26:36.261 --> 26:37.846
You faked your way through.

26:37.929 --> 26:41.266
HOWARD:<i> I need to hear</i>
<i>Officer Buzhardt's voice, Mr. Stone.</i>

26:41.349 --> 26:43.476
(helicopter whirring)

26:43.560 --> 26:44.978
That little boy loves you.

26:45.270 --> 26:46.229
(sobs)

26:46.313 --> 26:48.273
You got love in your life.

26:48.898 --> 26:49.983
Don't die.

26:57.866 --> 26:59.492
I'm not gonna screw around.

27:00.577 --> 27:01.661
On position.

27:02.203 --> 27:03.580
Prepare to assault.

27:04.122 --> 27:05.290
BUZHARDT: Hold it!

27:05.957 --> 27:07.751
Hold it, nobody fire!

27:07.834 --> 27:10.003
-We're coming out!
-Hold it! Hold it!

27:10.629 --> 27:12.714
(indistinct conversations)

27:13.131 --> 27:14.257
MAN: Standing by.

27:18.094 --> 27:19.429
Come on out, Mr. Stone.

27:21.806 --> 27:22.974
MAN 1: Appears to be unarmed.

27:23.058 --> 27:24.517
Man 2: Suspect out. Suspect out.

27:24.601 --> 27:26.519
Heads up. Heads up.

27:27.354 --> 27:29.147
HOWARD: Okay, down. Down! Spread-eagle!

27:29.230 --> 27:30.523
Ooh!

27:30.607 --> 27:31.650
Christopher!

27:33.360 --> 27:34.527
All right, dress him down.

27:36.696 --> 27:37.947
Where's my son?

27:38.615 --> 27:39.783
Where's my son?

27:41.701 --> 27:42.827
Christopher...

27:45.538 --> 27:47.749
Natalie, got a little<i> agua</i>
for these hounds here?

27:47.832 --> 27:49.668
Yeah, sure, there's a bowl around
here somewhere.

27:49.751 --> 27:51.836
Oh! Hello, doggies!

27:51.920 --> 27:53.880
It's okay. She likes it right behind the--

27:53.963 --> 27:57.008
(barking)

27:57.092 --> 27:59.969
-(barking continues)
-Hey, hey, easy!

28:00.053 --> 28:01.721
-Easy!
-Hey!

28:04.974 --> 28:07.894
-Okay now, easy!
-Easy, easy!

28:07.977 --> 28:08.937
Easy, easy. Sit, sit, sit!

28:09.020 --> 28:11.981
-What the hell's going on with them mutts?
-Easy, easy there.

28:12.524 --> 28:14.734
See what kind of goods
we got here, huh, Baron?

28:15.402 --> 28:16.486
(sniffs)

28:17.779 --> 28:20.782
I don't know who the prankster is
or what's going on here, but, uh...

28:20.865 --> 28:22.909
you guys keep this stuff up here
regular or what?

28:22.992 --> 28:24.828
-What, that tea?
-It's marijuana.

28:24.911 --> 28:26.746
What do you mean, marijuana?

28:26.830 --> 28:28.373
That's what they're taught
to sniff out, Sarge.

28:28.456 --> 28:29.958
What's the problem here?

28:30.041 --> 28:31.960
Dog says your tea is marijuana.

28:32.043 --> 28:34.421
Very high-quality stuff,
by the sounds of them.

28:34.504 --> 28:37.257
I was led to believe it was
ordinary Orange Pekoe.

28:37.340 --> 28:39.008
No. He don't bark at Pekoe.

28:39.884 --> 28:41.010
I'm not a dog...

28:41.636 --> 28:43.930
but to me, this smells like ordinary tea.

28:44.013 --> 28:45.140
-(sniffs)
-(dog whining)

28:45.223 --> 28:48.059
Maybe with something mixed in.

28:48.143 --> 28:50.520
Anybody here have an apple or an apple?

28:50.603 --> 28:53.189
Hey, Sarge, um...

28:53.606 --> 28:55.775
I know this is gonna sound funny,

28:55.859 --> 29:00.280
but did anybody complain
about being lightheaded?

29:00.697 --> 29:03.366
I know with the weather
being warm and everything,

29:03.450 --> 29:05.201
it makes you feel kind of
lightheaded, but--

29:05.285 --> 29:06.661
Did either of you happen to have

29:06.745 --> 29:09.038
any of Lieutenant Calletano's
tea this a.m.?

29:09.122 --> 29:11.082
Yeah, both of us.

29:11.166 --> 29:12.792
It was loaded with marijuana.

29:13.543 --> 29:14.544
Huh?

29:14.627 --> 29:16.337
You and Andy are stoned.

29:16.421 --> 29:17.464
-So am I.
-(dog whines)

29:17.547 --> 29:20.300
RAY: Stan, find out who else is stoned.

29:20.383 --> 29:22.302
And make sure they stay off the street.

29:22.385 --> 29:23.678
Right. Come on, let's clear out.

29:23.762 --> 29:26.097
-Come on.
-(barking)

29:26.723 --> 29:27.807
Natalie, can we do this?

29:27.891 --> 29:30.685
Lonny Stone a.k.a. Lawrence McKeever,

29:30.769 --> 29:33.271
robbery, attempted murder,
reckless endangerment, assault--

29:33.354 --> 29:35.440
Hang on, Sarge. Let me catch up.

29:35.523 --> 29:39.694
Lieutenant, a Mr. Stiglitz, line 4,
Northwest Firemen's Insurance?

29:39.778 --> 29:41.321
Aha!

29:41.404 --> 29:42.447
Nice work, Jane.

29:42.530 --> 29:44.073
NEAL: Package for you, Lieutenant.

29:44.991 --> 29:46.701
...grand theft auto...

29:48.411 --> 29:50.789
-Neal, got a scissors?
-...out of state.

29:51.122 --> 29:51.956
Thanks.

29:53.374 --> 29:55.543
RENKO: Just in time to watch me go down.

29:55.627 --> 29:57.212
Coming up for the execution?

29:57.295 --> 29:58.880
You pathetic bastard!

29:58.963 --> 30:00.507
Just don't screw up the kid, huh?

30:00.590 --> 30:03.676
Just don't screw him up
like you screwed up everything else!

30:05.178 --> 30:07.764
Lieutenant, this is the boy's mother.

30:08.765 --> 30:12.268
I know how difficult this is,
but you must be prepared.

30:12.352 --> 30:14.395
I know. I've been warned.

30:14.896 --> 30:15.897
Are you all right?

30:16.606 --> 30:17.816
I think so.

30:19.442 --> 30:20.276
This way.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.529
Yosemite, where the bears live.

30:22.612 --> 30:24.364
Then we went someplace else and stayed.

30:24.614 --> 30:26.658
-California?
-(door opens)

30:26.741 --> 30:28.952
Chris? Someone to see you.

30:32.080 --> 30:33.081
Hi, Chrissy.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.431
(sobs)

30:51.641 --> 30:54.227
Oh-ho-ho, Henry, you hound!

30:54.853 --> 30:56.771
You total Schnauzer.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.147
Let me see it.

30:59.315 --> 31:01.734
Oh! Man...

31:01.985 --> 31:04.571
-We're talking 24k here.
-Mm-hmm.

31:04.654 --> 31:05.864
We're talking.

31:06.447 --> 31:07.532
Aha!

31:07.615 --> 31:10.618
"My life is yours. Gina."

31:10.702 --> 31:12.620
Believe that? Brother.

31:12.704 --> 31:17.375
Ah, Mr. Stud service-- Gotta flaunt it
the one time you ever got it.

31:17.458 --> 31:19.919
-You got a problem, Harry?
-No, no problem.

31:20.003 --> 31:23.298
Hey, guys, Henry tell you about the time
I took him to the dating service?

31:23.548 --> 31:25.258
They sent him an S&amp;M queen.

31:25.341 --> 31:27.343
-Hey, Garibaldi.
-Lighten up, Harry.

31:27.427 --> 31:29.929
You know, Lieutenant,
that girl has been through a lot.

31:30.013 --> 31:31.931
What she needs is somebody
to take care of her,

31:32.015 --> 31:33.474
not mess with her head.

31:34.684 --> 31:36.311
Mess with her head?

31:36.394 --> 31:38.229
That's right, mess with her head,
which is what you're.

31:38.313 --> 31:40.398
Hey! Cut it out, man! Cut it out!

31:40.481 --> 31:41.649
Come on. Come on.

31:41.733 --> 31:42.817
MAN: Keep it down, guys.

31:43.985 --> 31:46.863
-Look... I'll tell her you said hello.
-(clangs)

31:46.946 --> 31:48.239
Come on, man.

31:52.744 --> 31:53.870
(exhales)

31:57.957 --> 31:58.958
NEAL: That was dumb...

31:59.208 --> 32:00.668
That was dumb.

32:01.127 --> 32:02.503
You know what gets me?

32:03.421 --> 32:05.006
The guy is twice her age.

32:05.381 --> 32:07.425
He's been married, he's got kids.

32:07.884 --> 32:09.469
I bet his idea of a great night

32:09.552 --> 32:11.846
is three hours of watching
public television.

32:11.930 --> 32:13.723
Twenty-four-carat gold, babe.

32:13.806 --> 32:16.017
I'd say the lady's made her own choice.

32:19.771 --> 32:20.730
FLETCHER: Okay.

32:21.481 --> 32:24.400
Up to now, I've stayed out of things,
pretty much.

32:24.484 --> 32:27.820
Uh, that's okay. That means we're having
a successful day so far.

32:28.071 --> 32:30.490
I think you guys are doing terrific.

32:30.573 --> 32:31.741
I feel like hell.

32:31.824 --> 32:33.159
That's as expected.

32:33.826 --> 32:34.827
Now, as far as I know,

32:34.911 --> 32:37.747
no one's come up with a magical drug
for emotional hurt.

32:37.997 --> 32:38.998
But I do know this,

32:39.082 --> 32:43.503
that old cliché, "no gain without pain,"
has a lot of bearing.

32:43.586 --> 32:44.587
As far as I'm concerned,

32:44.671 --> 32:47.423
I don't care if I ever see any of these
guys again as long as I live.

32:47.757 --> 32:49.884
Well, you just can't expect to shake hands

32:49.968 --> 32:51.886
and forget about everything
that's happened.

32:52.553 --> 32:55.723
And when you put your guns on today
and walk out of here,

32:56.182 --> 32:57.517
I'm not saying you're healed.

32:57.600 --> 33:00.061
But we're bringing
a lot of poison to the surface.

33:00.603 --> 33:03.815
Maybe in the days to come,
you'll learn something about forgiveness.

33:03.898 --> 33:05.775
Three days from now,
maybe you'll call one of these guys up

33:05.858 --> 33:08.820
and say, "Hey, I'm sorry,"
or "I didn't know,"

33:09.862 --> 33:11.864
or even "Let's get together."

33:12.991 --> 33:13.908
Now...

33:14.826 --> 33:16.077
In that spirit...

33:18.079 --> 33:19.956
does anyone have anything
they want to say?

33:23.584 --> 33:27.338
Yeah, I'd like to say
something to Joe Daley.

33:28.464 --> 33:29.424
Get a job.

33:29.507 --> 33:31.300
Hey, that's a jerk crack!

33:31.384 --> 33:32.635
(laughs) It's a joke!

33:32.927 --> 33:34.595
I'm trying to introduce some levity.

33:34.679 --> 33:37.140
God, you guys all take
yourselves so seriously.

33:37.557 --> 33:38.558
(scoffs)

33:40.476 --> 33:42.895
Know what? I got something I want to say.

33:46.107 --> 33:47.692
-I quit.
-(thuds)

33:48.151 --> 33:49.402
What are you doing?

33:49.485 --> 33:51.821
-Fletcher, say something to the man.
-Joe, Joe!

33:51.904 --> 33:52.989
Hey, come on, Joe.

33:54.532 --> 33:56.075
Honest to God, I think I mean it.

33:56.451 --> 33:59.787
Come on, Fletcher. For crying out loud,
tell him his job's okay.

33:59.871 --> 34:03.207
Not just 'cause of what Fletch said.
I don't need it.

34:03.750 --> 34:06.002
I got a brother who died
of a heart attack last year,

34:06.377 --> 34:07.670
two years younger than me.

34:08.546 --> 34:09.839
I want to lead a life.

34:10.840 --> 34:11.674
I'm going home.

34:11.758 --> 34:14.927
Joe, come on!
We'll have lunch one day this week.

34:15.011 --> 34:16.721
We'll iron it all out!

34:17.055 --> 34:18.056
(door opens, closes)

34:27.732 --> 34:29.859
Well, he'll... He'll be back tomorrow.

34:29.942 --> 34:32.737
He'll change his mind. He'll be back.

34:34.405 --> 34:35.406
Maybe not.

34:39.160 --> 34:42.413
He's a man who's been very unhappy
with what he's doing for a long time.

34:43.081 --> 34:44.332
I don't believe this.

34:47.877 --> 34:49.087
This is what's wrong.

34:49.962 --> 34:52.465
This is what's wrong
with this whole department here.

34:53.966 --> 34:55.635
You all sit around here,

34:56.094 --> 34:59.430
and you let a guy screw up
his entire career like that.

34:59.722 --> 35:03.476
He's got two years to go,
two years, fellas.

35:03.559 --> 35:06.187
And you let him walk
out of here like that,

35:06.604 --> 35:08.439
and nobody does anything?

35:09.190 --> 35:13.361
We just watched a man
commit professional suicide in this room!

35:13.778 --> 35:15.947
Who says change has to be a bad thing?

35:16.030 --> 35:19.117
I'm so sick and tired
of your psychobabble baloney.

35:20.076 --> 35:22.745
The next thing, you're gonna be saying
that the reason I'm upset

35:23.246 --> 35:26.082
is because I wish
I was doing what Joe just did!

35:26.165 --> 35:27.333
Nobody's saying that.

35:27.416 --> 35:29.168
Oh, I'm sick of all of you.

35:29.460 --> 35:32.964
I'm sick of the whole bunch of you.
I'm sick of all of you--

35:33.714 --> 35:34.841
the whole bunch of you!

35:45.184 --> 35:46.144
(sighs)

35:50.022 --> 35:52.859
-(telephone ringing)
-(chattering)

35:57.572 --> 35:58.614
Hey, Sarge.

36:03.703 --> 36:05.079
What the hell is this?

36:05.955 --> 36:06.873
Weekend shift.

36:08.374 --> 36:11.127
I worked the last two weekends.
You give it to somebody else.

36:11.752 --> 36:14.630
If you can work out a trade on your own
be my guest.

36:23.973 --> 36:25.516
I've had a bellyful of this.

36:26.350 --> 36:27.727
What's that, Detective?

36:28.436 --> 36:30.771
Of you giving me and Robin
the cold shoulder,

36:31.898 --> 36:34.025
of you giving me this kind of crap!

36:35.401 --> 36:37.528
You got no reason to treat me like this.

36:38.321 --> 36:40.114
To what are you referencing, Detective?

36:40.281 --> 36:42.533
Don't give me that "detective" crap.

36:42.992 --> 36:45.077
I'm referencing me and Robin.

36:46.287 --> 36:49.290
What do I have to do for you and me
to be friends again, break up with her?

36:49.540 --> 36:50.499
Of course not.

36:51.709 --> 36:53.336
A young man like yourself,
you should have a girl.

36:53.669 --> 36:56.005
Then why are you making it
like I gotta choose between you?

36:56.088 --> 36:59.425
Look, I don't wanna be some old guy
hanging around between the two of you,

36:59.967 --> 37:02.929
you not knowing how to tell me to go home
without hurting my feelings.

37:03.012 --> 37:04.055
I got my pride.

37:04.722 --> 37:06.766
Oh, hearing this makes me angry.

37:06.849 --> 37:07.725
-Baloney--
-Yes, it is!

37:07.808 --> 37:09.060
-Baloney--
-Yes, it is!

37:09.769 --> 37:11.562
You picked me up when I was down.

37:13.564 --> 37:15.149
You treated me special.

37:16.734 --> 37:18.778
I never had a friend like that before.

37:21.656 --> 37:24.450
I could talk to you
like I used to talk to my father.

37:24.700 --> 37:26.244
I'm not your father, and I don't wanna be.

37:26.327 --> 37:27.536
And I don't want one!

37:27.620 --> 37:29.038
I needed a friend.

37:30.581 --> 37:32.833
I thought I had one. Maybe I was wrong.

37:36.921 --> 37:38.422
(snoring)

37:46.138 --> 37:47.181
STAN: Mrs. Furillo!

37:48.766 --> 37:51.269
I beg your pardon.
This is the ladies' room!

37:51.602 --> 37:53.562
I beg your pardon, ma'am,
this is the men's room.

37:55.398 --> 37:56.232
Oh.

37:56.983 --> 38:00.861
Well, I certainly hope so...
for your sake.

38:01.153 --> 38:02.113
Excuse me.

38:10.663 --> 38:11.497
Here, give me that.

38:13.666 --> 38:14.917
Look, Mick, I, uh...

38:17.461 --> 38:18.838
I was hurt. I, uh...

38:19.463 --> 38:22.508
I don't know. I felt left out in the cold,
and I took it out on you.

38:23.926 --> 38:24.760
I'm sorry.

38:28.973 --> 38:29.807
Okay?

38:32.351 --> 38:33.185
Pfft!

38:39.984 --> 38:42.153
I'm sorry I said
anything about my daughter.

38:42.236 --> 38:44.030
Her problems are none
of your damn business.

38:44.113 --> 38:47.283
Hey, a lot of guys' daughters
have drug problems.

38:47.366 --> 38:48.409
But I'm just saying,

38:48.492 --> 38:51.495
I do not want any of this
coming back to me

38:51.579 --> 38:54.790
-from anybody here, all right?
-MIKE: It won't be.

38:54.874 --> 38:56.125
We've all agreed to that.

38:57.835 --> 38:59.003
Okay.

38:59.837 --> 39:00.963
Home stretch, guys.

39:02.590 --> 39:04.675
I want to put you
on the spot one last time.

39:05.134 --> 39:08.179
I think we can agree at this point
that no one here's perfect.

39:08.637 --> 39:09.847
Frank's perfect.

39:10.431 --> 39:11.265
Thinks he is.

39:11.974 --> 39:14.643
Assuming that,
I'm gonna ask each of you in turn,

39:14.727 --> 39:17.563
if there was one thing
that you could change about yourself...

39:19.440 --> 39:20.608
what would you change?

39:20.691 --> 39:21.609
Like what?

39:22.568 --> 39:24.653
I wish I wasn't going bald.

39:25.696 --> 39:26.655
You mean like that?

39:27.948 --> 39:31.452
I'm asking, if you could reach down
into your guts

39:31.535 --> 39:33.746
and change something
fundamental about yourself,

39:33.829 --> 39:35.456
about the way you live your life,

39:37.416 --> 39:38.751
what would you change?

39:39.085 --> 39:41.796
If I was Gene Scapizi,
I'd change my underwear once in a while.

39:42.338 --> 39:45.841
Hey, wise guy, once is a little funny,
two is a little funny.

39:46.008 --> 39:47.426
You've been sitting over there all day.

39:47.676 --> 39:49.512
You do it one more time,
I'm gonna come over,

39:49.595 --> 39:52.139
I'm gonna put my fist down your throat.
You understand, huh?

39:52.223 --> 39:53.265
Big man, huh?

39:57.061 --> 39:58.813
If I could change anything...

40:00.356 --> 40:02.817
I'd change that I get so scared.

40:03.692 --> 40:04.860
What scares you, Gene?

40:08.155 --> 40:09.198
Sometimes...

40:10.908 --> 40:11.742
everything.

40:12.910 --> 40:14.161
What scares you the most?

40:14.829 --> 40:16.539
What scares me the most?

40:23.754 --> 40:28.551
What scares me the most
is that maybe my wife is having an affair.

40:28.801 --> 40:31.262
Not "scared maybe."
You know she's having an affair.

40:33.806 --> 40:35.015
I put in my hours...

40:35.850 --> 40:39.353
I go out for some drinks
with some of the guys after work.

40:41.939 --> 40:43.107
I get home...

40:45.067 --> 40:46.527
feeling dead inside.

40:48.904 --> 40:50.614
Sometimes she's not even there.

40:53.826 --> 40:55.453
I don't know how to tell her...

40:57.246 --> 40:58.205
I love her.

41:03.252 --> 41:05.254
I don't wanna ask her any questions

41:05.588 --> 41:08.549
because I'm afraid of the answers.

41:11.677 --> 41:14.096
My God, the woman is so beautiful.

41:15.848 --> 41:16.765
(inhales)

41:17.433 --> 41:20.519
She must have lost 20 pounds
in the last six months.

41:20.603 --> 41:22.521
She's gotta be doing it for somebody.

41:22.855 --> 41:24.064
What would you change?

41:26.859 --> 41:28.861
I just wouldn't want it to be like that.

41:29.403 --> 41:31.322
What would you do
to make it not like that?

41:34.241 --> 41:35.826
Put my arms around her...

41:40.206 --> 41:42.208
and tell her how beautiful she is.

41:43.375 --> 41:46.212
And I don't care
who she's getting herself beautiful for.

41:47.838 --> 41:49.089
By God, I'd tell her...

41:50.049 --> 41:50.883
I love her.

41:55.387 --> 41:58.724
I'd tell her I don't want to feel
dead inside anymore.

42:06.565 --> 42:07.900
I hope you do that, Gene.

42:12.780 --> 42:13.739
How about you, Pete?

42:14.406 --> 42:15.616
Change my color.

42:17.201 --> 42:18.077
Yeah.

42:18.911 --> 42:21.580
God help me,
that's what I would like to do.

42:21.664 --> 42:23.666
I would like to just change my color.

42:25.376 --> 42:26.335
Why?

42:26.710 --> 42:28.045
Because, um...

42:29.255 --> 42:32.007
I'm not as brave as I'm supposed to be

42:32.091 --> 42:36.262
because I'd like things
to be just a little bit easier!

42:36.762 --> 42:38.055
What's your second choice?

42:39.181 --> 42:40.349
(chuckles)

42:43.310 --> 42:44.186
Okay...

42:46.981 --> 42:48.399
Okay. Um...

42:49.066 --> 42:49.900
Um...

42:51.527 --> 42:52.861
I guess I would like...

42:53.988 --> 42:54.947
(sighs)

42:55.030 --> 42:59.285
...for my frustrations
not to get to me all the time.

42:59.368 --> 43:00.578
Seems like, um...

43:01.537 --> 43:05.249
Sometimes I just... defeat myself.

43:14.049 --> 43:15.009
How about you, Frank?

43:15.092 --> 43:16.302
I don't think I can answer.

43:17.219 --> 43:19.847
Told you. The guy thinks he's perfect.

43:23.684 --> 43:25.269
No, I reject the premise.

43:26.687 --> 43:29.356
I have to live with who I am,
not who I'd want to be.

43:31.191 --> 43:32.985
You can't sit here
and speculate about yourself

43:33.068 --> 43:36.905
as if you could reach down inside
and amputate what you don't like.

43:37.406 --> 43:39.992
But if you could? Uh, humor me.

43:41.952 --> 43:43.996
That I have to keep myself
reined in so tight.

43:44.413 --> 43:45.331
What if you let go?

43:46.248 --> 43:47.416
I can't trust myself.

43:50.794 --> 43:53.005
I'm not like other people.
I'm an alcoholic.

43:55.549 --> 43:57.635
I'm capable of things that are monstrous,

43:58.719 --> 44:01.472
so I have to take life as it comes,
a day at a time.

44:02.014 --> 44:04.058
A crap. I knew that's what this was.

44:04.516 --> 44:05.893
That "crap" saved my life.

44:06.226 --> 44:08.520
Getting hooked on meetings
instead of bottles, huh?

44:08.896 --> 44:11.982
Trading in your cocktails
for a couple of catchphrases

44:12.066 --> 44:14.151
and penny-ante psychology?

44:14.234 --> 44:15.527
What do you need, Warren?

44:16.528 --> 44:17.613
You're no better than the rest of us.

44:17.696 --> 44:19.948
-I never said I was.
-You say it every day.

44:20.032 --> 44:23.535
St. Francis Furillo
with his altar-boy manners

44:23.619 --> 44:25.913
-and his Barbie-doll wife--
-Leave her out of it!

44:25.996 --> 44:27.915
Frank! Hey, hey!

44:27.998 --> 44:31.126
MIKE: Frank, Warren didn't mean anything.
Come on.

44:36.173 --> 44:37.007
I'm sorry.

44:41.595 --> 44:42.971
Disown the behavior, Frank.

44:43.931 --> 44:45.307
Don't disown the feelings.

44:47.601 --> 44:50.813
You're as miserable as the rest of us,
Furillo.

44:51.980 --> 44:54.108
You're... You're as miserable as I am.

44:55.776 --> 44:56.652
As I am.

45:05.911 --> 45:06.912
Stan.

45:07.621 --> 45:09.498
Oh, Ray, you wanna catch me up?

45:09.581 --> 45:12.126
Frank, there is something I must explain.

45:18.340 --> 45:20.718
I brought in some tea
that had marijuana in it.

45:21.135 --> 45:22.845
At least six people drank it.

45:22.928 --> 45:23.846
Marijuana?

45:24.847 --> 45:27.433
If there is an investigation,
I will open house and heart.

45:27.808 --> 45:28.892
I am innocent.

45:28.976 --> 45:30.394
I spoke with Rosa.

45:30.853 --> 45:33.272
It was the tea of her cousin
Elvira from Ecuador,

45:33.355 --> 45:34.982
who stayed with us last year.

45:35.065 --> 45:36.024
I swear it.

45:37.276 --> 45:38.193
I believe you.

45:38.902 --> 45:40.446
But will Internal Affairs?

45:40.529 --> 45:42.990
-Well, there been any citizen complaints?
-No.

45:43.073 --> 45:44.908
Then it'll never get to Internal Affairs.

45:46.952 --> 45:49.705
Listen, I heard a cop
was taken hostage today.

45:50.164 --> 45:52.916
Yes. The release of Officer Buzhardt

45:53.000 --> 45:55.794
was achieved without
any loss of life or injury.

45:55.878 --> 45:59.465
Well, I talked to Howard on the car phone,
and he says that you held a steady hand

45:59.548 --> 46:02.050
and made some sound judgments
that helped the resolution.

46:02.134 --> 46:03.177
I hope so.

46:03.427 --> 46:04.970
Yes, yes, I believe so.

46:05.053 --> 46:08.265
So, we have one meaningful victory,

46:08.348 --> 46:11.018
and one defeat that
we'll laugh off tomorrow.

46:11.101 --> 46:13.896
I call that an above-average day.

46:15.105 --> 46:15.939
Thank you.

46:16.565 --> 46:17.441
Thank you.

46:25.532 --> 46:27.576
In my seven years as Lieutenant,

46:27.993 --> 46:31.413
this was only my second day
of a station command.

46:32.039 --> 46:32.915
I liked it.

46:33.707 --> 46:34.541
I know.

46:43.967 --> 46:47.721
-Mm, the munchies.
-Mm-hmm.

46:48.222 --> 46:51.099
Still feeling the aftereffects
of Rosa Calletano's tea.

46:51.183 --> 46:52.309
(laughs)

46:53.060 --> 46:56.188
I can't remember
what I used to like about the sensation.

46:57.064 --> 46:58.565
Maybe it's age or wisdom,

46:58.649 --> 47:00.984
but I don't like feeling
so out of control.

47:01.068 --> 47:02.820
Neither do I after today.

47:03.403 --> 47:04.321
Oh.

47:04.947 --> 47:06.031
Well, give me the dirt.

47:06.990 --> 47:10.494
-Did Fletcher get his comeuppance?
-Well, among others.

47:10.577 --> 47:11.995
(laughs)

47:13.330 --> 47:17.668
Do I gather our man Furillo
was the target of some verbal blows?

47:18.919 --> 47:21.255
Well, Warren Briscoe got in a few shots.

47:21.338 --> 47:22.214
Really?

47:23.507 --> 47:25.259
Nothing our man didn't already know.

47:25.926 --> 47:29.179
Just put together
with spit and baling wire,

47:30.097 --> 47:33.016
and that the model still needed some work
after it left the plant.

47:34.852 --> 47:38.188
Well, sounds like he barely
laid a glove on you.

47:38.605 --> 47:40.774
It felt as if he was landing haymakers.

47:44.486 --> 47:45.487
Mm.

47:46.780 --> 47:48.323
Ooh! What's going on?

47:48.824 --> 47:51.076
I'm... checking for bruises.

47:51.159 --> 47:54.538
(both laughing)

47:54.621 --> 47:56.373
FRANK: Wait a minute, wait a minute,
a little to the left.

47:56.456 --> 47:58.625
-JOYCE: Uh-huh.
-(both laughing)

47:58.709 --> 48:00.210
FRANK: Bingo.

48:02.588 --> 48:04.715
(theme music playing)
