00:56.048 --> 00:58.259
Lornsome night.

00:59.343 --> 01:04.056
Babbits bawlin', wind bitin' the bone.

01:05.933 --> 01:07.810
Wind like this...

01:09.019 --> 01:11.021
full of voices.

01:12.273 --> 01:15.234
Ancestry howlin' at ya,

01:16.026 --> 01:18.320
yibberin' stories.

01:20.364 --> 01:25.160
All voices... tied up in't'one.

01:27.663 --> 01:29.999
One voice different...

01:30.749 --> 01:32.293
One voice,

01:33.586 --> 01:39.341
whisperin' out there,
spyin' from the dark.

01:40.593 --> 01:44.179
That fangy devil,

01:45.222 --> 01:48.183
Ol' Georgie himself.

01:50.728 --> 01:53.522
Now you hear up close,

01:53.981 --> 01:58.652
and I'll yarn you about
the first time we met,

01:58.777 --> 02:01.071
eye to eye.

02:05.159 --> 02:09.205
<i>And thus it was that I made the
acquaintance of Dr. Henry Goose,</i>

02:09.330 --> 02:12.082
<i>the man I hoped might
cure me of my affliction.</i>

02:23.844 --> 02:26.055
Have you lost something?

02:27.556 --> 02:29.725
Question one.

02:29.850 --> 02:35.940
What secret in Sixsmith's report
would be worth killing for?

02:36.065 --> 02:37.566
Question two.

02:37.691 --> 02:42.821
Is it reasonable to believe that they
would kill again to protect that secret?

02:42.863 --> 02:45.824
And if so, question three.

02:45.950 --> 02:47.868
What the fuck am I doing here?

02:50.246 --> 02:53.081
<i>While my extensive
experience as an editor</i>

02:53.082 --> 02:55.416
<i>has lead me to a disdain for flashbacks</i>

02:55.417 --> 02:58.462
<i>and flashforwards, and all
such tricksy gimmicks,</i>

02:58.963 --> 03:00.881
<i>I believe that if you, dear reader,</i>

03:00.882 --> 03:04.051
<i>can extend your patience
for a just a moment,</i>

03:04.635 --> 03:08.097
<i>you will find there is a method
to this tale of madness.</i>

03:08.764 --> 03:11.058
<i>My dearest Sixsmith,</i>

03:11.183 --> 03:14.520
<i>I shot myself through the roof
of my mouth this morning,</i>

03:14.562 --> 03:16.355
<i>with Vyvyan Ayrs' Luger.</i>

03:18.399 --> 03:23.654
<i>A true suicide is a paced,
disciplined certainty.</i>

03:24.989 --> 03:29.785
<i>People pontificate "suicide
is an coward's act".</i>

03:29.869 --> 03:32.371
<i>Couldn't be further from the truth.</i>

03:32.997 --> 03:35.332
<i>Suicide takes tremendous courage.</i>

03:39.003 --> 03:41.087
Any problem, sir,
you just hit this button.

03:41.088 --> 03:42.172
Thank you.

03:48.554 --> 03:52.683
On behalf of my Ministry,
and the future of Unanimity,

03:52.808 --> 03:56.186
I would like to thank you
for this final interview.

04:05.321 --> 04:07.156
– Hello.
– Press pass.

04:08.282 --> 04:09.533
Expecting trouble?

04:09.825 --> 04:14.079
I was Dermot Hoggins' publisher,
not his shrink or his astrologer,

04:14.205 --> 04:16.290
and the ruddy, bloody truth is,

04:16.874 --> 04:20.127
I had no idea what the man
was gonna do that night.

04:20.252 --> 04:24.632
This beach was once
a cannibal's banqueting hall,

04:24.757 --> 04:29.762
where the strong gorged on the weak,
but the teeth, sir, they spat out,

04:29.803 --> 04:33.682
like you or I would
expel a cherry stone.

04:34.850 --> 04:39.188
Do you know the price a quarter
pound of these will earn?

04:39.813 --> 04:43.943
Remember this is not
an interrogation or a trial.

04:44.860 --> 04:48.697
Your version of the truth
is all that matters.

04:49.573 --> 04:52.034
Truth is singular.

04:53.369 --> 04:56.664
Its "versions" are... mistruths.

04:58.123 --> 05:00.834
<i>Don't let them say
I killed myself for love.</i>

05:02.127 --> 05:05.129
<i>Had my infatuations, but we
both know in our hearts</i>

05:05.130 --> 05:08.008
<i>who is the sole love
of my short, bright life.</i>

PACIFIC ISLANDS, 1849

05:35.703 --> 05:38.122
There you are, Mr. Ewing,

05:38.247 --> 05:41.834
as binding a covenant
there can ever be between men...

05:41.959 --> 05:44.044
outside the province of Scripture.

05:44.169 --> 05:46.045
Thank you, Reverend Horrox, I...

05:46.046 --> 05:48.841
know my father-in-law is
profoundly excited about this deal.

05:49.216 --> 05:51.635
Haskell Moore is a great man.

05:52.011 --> 05:54.555
Future generations depend
on men like him,

05:54.638 --> 05:57.474
men capable of speaking the truth.

05:57.600 --> 05:58.934
Quite.

06:03.147 --> 06:05.733
When I first encountered
Haskell Moore's writing,

06:05.774 --> 06:09.820
its perspicuity stroke me as though
delivered through divine revelation.

06:09.987 --> 06:11.278
The learned doctor here and I,

06:11.279 --> 06:13.741
already spent many a night
debating Mr. Moore's tractus.

06:13.766 --> 06:16.131
I'm only willing to conceive
that he makes a compelling case

06:16.160 --> 06:19.496
as to why we are sitting here,
enjoying this divine lamb,

06:19.538 --> 06:23.918
while Kupaka stands
there, contempt to serve.

06:24.043 --> 06:26.295
Indeed, ain'it.
Uh, Kupaka...

06:26.420 --> 06:30.132
you enjoy your life here
with us, do you not?

06:30.257 --> 06:32.301
Oh, yes, Reverend, sir.

06:32.426 --> 06:34.345
Kupaka very happy here.

06:34.470 --> 06:36.722
See, you see, this is Moore's
ladder of civilization.

06:36.723 --> 06:39.183
The reason behind this natural order...

06:39.225 --> 06:40.768
Please, Giles, do shut up.

06:41.101 --> 06:43.270
I've been listening to
this for weeks, I...

06:43.395 --> 06:46.649
would love to know what his own
son-in-law has to say about it.

06:47.441 --> 06:48.817
Let's see...

06:49.526 --> 06:53.322
It is an inquiry concerning
God's will and the nature of men.

06:53.447 --> 06:55.866
And what does he have to say
about the nature of women?

06:57.576 --> 07:01.247
I'm afraid that's a subject
he prefers to pass by in silence.

07:01.789 --> 07:03.707
He wouldn't be the first.

07:03.791 --> 07:05.960
Uh, prey, Mr. Ewing, continue.

07:06.293 --> 07:09.547
Well, uh... the question
he does pose is...

07:10.047 --> 07:13.841
if God created the world, how do
we know what things we can change,

07:13.842 --> 07:17.638
and what things must remain
sacred and inviolable?

07:19.306 --> 07:22.893
Reverend Horrox' real specific
how to run plantation.

07:23.102 --> 07:25.354
Georgian way best way he say.

07:25.437 --> 07:28.190
God, this heat is unbearable.
How do they take it?

07:28.399 --> 07:30.150
Reverend Horrox say

07:30.276 --> 07:33.195
slaves like camel, bred for desert.

07:33.320 --> 07:37.199
He say... they not feel
heat like civilized folk.

07:37.324 --> 07:39.743
Now we should get you out of the sun.

07:41.287 --> 07:44.665
Now what... what is that noise?

08:49.813 --> 08:52.066
– Ah, there you are.
– What happened?

08:53.525 --> 08:57.363
It is as I suspected.
Gusano Coco Cervello,

08:57.404 --> 08:59.615
better known as the Polynesian worm.

08:59.740 --> 09:02.868
Once saw a man's brain after
the worm had finished with him...

09:02.993 --> 09:04.662
maggoty cauliflower. Ooph.

09:06.413 --> 09:10.793
But have no fear, this particular
devil and I... are well acquainted.

09:10.918 --> 09:15.589
Here we go.
Ah, yes, yes, all gone.

09:19.843 --> 09:23.264
I-I don't know what I would have
done had our paths not crossed.

09:23.389 --> 09:25.182
Well for starters, you would have died.

09:27.393 --> 09:29.812
I... I shall find a way to repay you.

09:29.853 --> 09:34.483
Oh, unnecessary, I assure you.
I am a doctor, Adam.

09:34.900 --> 09:37.319
A tiger cannot change its stripes.

09:38.195 --> 09:40.530
CAMBRIDGE, 1936

09:40.531 --> 09:45.202
<i>Sixsmith, I do hope you will be able
to find it in your heart to forgive me.</i>

09:48.122 --> 09:49.039
<i>Mr. Frobisher.</i>

09:51.792 --> 09:54.003
<i>Mr. Robert Frobisher!</i>

09:56.797 --> 09:59.466
The management would like
a word with you, please, sir.

10:03.971 --> 10:06.223
<i>Mr. Frobisher, open this door, please!</i>

10:08.017 --> 10:10.936
I do know you're in there, Mr. Frobisher,
please, comply.

10:15.357 --> 10:18.235
A letter is being drafted
to your father, sir.

10:28.829 --> 10:30.915
<i>Mr. Frobisher!</i>

10:31.749 --> 10:36.086
<i>Hated leaving you like that.
Wasn't the goodbye I had in mind.</i>

10:40.216 --> 10:44.136
<i>By the time you read this,
I will be on my way to Edinburgh,</i>

10:44.220 --> 10:47.014
<i>on my way to fame and fortune.</i>

10:47.223 --> 10:50.226
<i>I know you haven't heard of him,
but trust me,</i>

10:50.351 --> 10:54.271
<i>Vyvyan Ayrs is one of
the musical greats, Sixsmith.</i>

10:54.355 --> 10:58.317
<i>The tragedy is that he hasn't produced
any new work in years due to illness.</i>

10:58.484 --> 11:03.030
<i>My scheme is to persuade him
to hire me as his amanuensis,</i>

11:03.155 --> 11:05.908
<i>and aid him in the creation
of a masterpiece,</i>

11:06.033 --> 11:08.952
<i>before shooting up through
the musical firmament,</i>

11:08.953 --> 11:11.789
<i>eventually obliging
Pater to admit that yes,</i>

11:11.914 --> 11:15.291
<i>the son he disinherited is none
other than Robert Frobisher,</i>

11:15.292 --> 11:18.671
<i>the greatest British composer of his time.</i>

11:19.171 --> 11:23.175
<i>I know, Sixsmith, you groan and
shake your head, but you smile too,</i>

11:23.300 --> 11:25.010
<i>which is why I love you.</i>

11:26.387 --> 11:27.471
<i>P.S.:</i>

11:28.556 --> 11:30.015
<i>Thanks for the waistcoat.</i>

11:31.433 --> 11:34.061
<i>I needed something of yours
to keep me company.</i>

11:35.396 --> 11:37.481
St. George and the Dragon.

11:38.899 --> 11:42.027
Reminds me that composing is a crusade.

11:42.152 --> 11:44.697
Sometimes you slay the dragon,

11:44.822 --> 11:48.242
sometimes the dragon slays you.

11:49.743 --> 11:50.870
Alright, then.

11:51.620 --> 11:53.372
Frobisher, is it?

11:53.497 --> 11:56.709
I trust Mackerras told
you enough to be useful.

11:57.084 --> 12:00.753
I've had this little melody for viola
rattling about my head for months,

12:00.754 --> 12:02.631
let's see if you can get it down.

12:15.811 --> 12:18.606
Subtle grace note before the third.

12:22.818 --> 12:26.739
Soft and simple. Got it?
Now, it gets interesting.

12:37.333 --> 12:38.751
Good.

12:38.876 --> 12:40.419
Play that back.

12:42.880 --> 12:44.423
Would love to, sir.

12:46.967 --> 12:50.137
Um... what key are we in?

12:50.262 --> 12:52.973
What key?
G minor, of course.

12:53.098 --> 12:55.059
And the time signature?

12:55.809 --> 12:57.895
For Christ's sake, did you hear it or not?

12:58.437 --> 13:01.106
– Just... just need a little more time.
– You need?

13:01.398 --> 13:04.109
My dear boy, who is working for whom here?

13:04.235 --> 13:06.820
– I apologize, sir...
– Are you an amanuensis or an apologist?

13:06.862 --> 13:07.780
Now pay attention.

13:07.821 --> 13:09.949
Three-four, changes to
four-four on fourth bar

13:09.990 --> 13:11.617
and back to three-four on bar five,

13:11.700 --> 13:13.452
if you can count that high.

13:13.619 --> 13:18.374
Crotchet G, pause for a quaver, repeat
G quaver, then E-flat on the down beat.

13:20.668 --> 13:22.127
And so on.

13:22.545 --> 13:24.630
Alright, let me hear you.

13:52.575 --> 13:54.827
Stop, please! You're hurting me!

13:54.910 --> 13:58.122
You must have misheard me,
I said I had a melody not a malady!

13:58.163 --> 13:59.582
Vyvyan...

13:59.623 --> 14:02.084
Jocasta, deliver me!

14:02.626 --> 14:06.255
– What's going on in here?
– An exercise in futility.

14:06.380 --> 14:07.631
Should I be introduced?

14:07.715 --> 14:10.843
There's really no point,
the boy is useful as the clap.

14:11.093 --> 14:13.637
Fortunately, he'll be much
easier to get rid of.

14:13.721 --> 14:16.557
Would you be a dear
and get Henry to show the boy out.

14:16.724 --> 14:18.726
Yes, of course, darling.

14:35.951 --> 14:37.620
That's beautiful.

14:39.538 --> 14:40.915
Yes...

14:41.874 --> 14:45.085
That's it.
That's my melody!

14:48.631 --> 14:50.507
SAN FRANCISCO, 1973

14:50.549 --> 14:54.136
Com'on, Luisa, we're made to be together!

14:54.303 --> 14:56.680
Luisa, Luisa, com'on, com'on,
I'm telling you,

14:56.722 --> 14:59.183
I'm telling you baby,
you can't leave me. It's a...

14:59.225 --> 15:01.727
Don't know if it's a past life thing
or a future life thing,

15:01.769 --> 15:03.103
but you know, you and me...

15:03.104 --> 15:07.566
Look. For the last hour, all I could think
about was throwing you off the balcony.

15:07.691 --> 15:10.069
Well then who the hell you think you are?

15:10.152 --> 15:13.489
You write a bullshit
column for a fucking rag.

15:13.989 --> 15:15.157
Elevator!

15:18.786 --> 15:20.162
Thank you.

15:24.083 --> 15:27.253
Nice to know the age
of chivalry isn't dead.

15:41.475 --> 15:42.893
You okay?

15:43.519 --> 15:45.646
No bones broken, I think.

15:46.605 --> 15:50.317
No, no, no, you sit... you sit yourself.
Let me see.

15:59.243 --> 16:02.288
Great. Power outage.

16:02.663 --> 16:06.166
Perfect end to a perfect day.

16:10.629 --> 16:13.632
Still glad the age of chivalry isn't dead?

16:15.175 --> 16:19.054
I'd still rather be right here
than back up there.

16:19.096 --> 16:22.224
Guess Mr. Kipin isn't
everyone's cup of tea.

16:22.433 --> 16:26.061
Guys like that are just
an occupational hazard.

16:27.563 --> 16:31.942
– You were interviewing him?
– Yeah, for Spyglass magazine.

16:33.360 --> 16:34.862
Luisa Rey.

16:35.279 --> 16:36.947
Rufus Sixsmith.

16:37.489 --> 16:39.033
Rey...

16:41.619 --> 16:45.289
You wouldn't happen to be related
to the journalist Lester Rey?

16:45.915 --> 16:48.500
Yeah.
He was my father.

16:48.918 --> 16:53.005
Really? He must have been
enormously proud of you,

16:53.130 --> 16:55.174
– following in his footsteps.
– Hmm.

16:57.259 --> 17:00.262
That's her. My niece, Megan.

17:00.679 --> 17:02.139
She's lovely!

17:02.223 --> 17:06.518
Born physicist, with a better mind
for mathematics than I ever had.

17:07.144 --> 17:10.521
Did her PhD at Cambridge,
a woman at Caius!

17:11.482 --> 17:13.317
Gives you hope for the world.

17:16.819 --> 17:18.155
It's hot.

17:21.075 --> 17:23.702
And we're still here.

17:32.586 --> 17:35.005
That's a very peculiar birthmark.

17:36.340 --> 17:39.635
Yeah.
My little comet.

17:40.678 --> 17:42.888
My mother was sure it was cancer,

17:43.055 --> 17:45.057
she wanted me to get it removed, but...

17:45.224 --> 17:47.768
don't know. I kinda like it.

17:48.477 --> 17:52.022
I knew someone who had
a birthmark that was...

17:52.523 --> 17:54.942
– similar to that.
– Really?

17:55.484 --> 17:56.610
Who was it?

17:58.279 --> 18:00.573
Someone I cared about very much.

18:03.909 --> 18:09.039
A uh... a hypothetical
question for you, Miss Rey.

18:10.165 --> 18:12.418
As a journalist,

18:12.793 --> 18:15.546
what price would you pay
to protect the source?

18:16.171 --> 18:17.464
Any.

18:18.132 --> 18:19.466
Prison?

18:20.634 --> 18:23.721
If it came to that, yes.

18:23.846 --> 18:26.181
Would you be prepared to...

18:26.307 --> 18:28.309
compromise your safety?

18:32.855 --> 18:36.232
My father braved booby-trapped marshes and

18:36.233 --> 18:39.612
the wrath of generals
for his journalistic integrity.

18:40.404 --> 18:44.575
What kind of daughter would I be if I
bailed when things got a little tough?

19:00.174 --> 19:02.009
Saved.

19:02.051 --> 19:04.136
Taxi!

19:04.720 --> 19:08.390
– You sure you don't need a cab?
– No, I've got my car.

19:09.058 --> 19:14.104
Well, you know if... there's ever
something I can do for you,

19:14.188 --> 19:16.023
please give me a call.

19:17.107 --> 19:18.817
Thank you, I will.

19:19.443 --> 19:20.402
Bye.

19:24.823 --> 19:26.116
LONDON, 2012

19:26.242 --> 19:28.744
<i>It was the night of the Lemon Prizes,</i>

19:29.954 --> 19:32.790
<i>and in its two lead forced duality,</i>

19:32.915 --> 19:36.001
<i>I recall a moment of introspection.</i>

19:36.126 --> 19:42.424
<i>Why. Why would anyone in their
right mind choose to be a publisher?</i>

19:42.550 --> 19:45.719
<i>This was the precise moment
that Dermot found me.</i>

19:45.761 --> 19:48.430
– Oy, Timothy.
– Aah, Dermot.

19:48.556 --> 19:51.267
<i>Bad news inexorably does.</i>

19:51.392 --> 19:52.601
Fockin' waste.

19:53.310 --> 19:55.520
Never forget Herman Melville,

19:55.521 --> 19:59.441
writes a ripping yarn about a big white
whale which is summarily dismissed,

19:59.483 --> 20:02.695
and yet today, it is lugged
around in the backpacks

20:02.736 --> 20:05.072
of every serious student
of literature in the world.

20:05.114 --> 20:07.198
I don't give a fock what
happens when I'm dead,

20:07.199 --> 20:09.034
I want people to buy me book now!

20:09.785 --> 20:13.163
Well, as your publisher, obviously
nothing would make me happier.

20:13.205 --> 20:15.541
But sadly, for whatever reason,

20:15.749 --> 20:18.294
"Knuckle Sandwich" has yet
to connect to its audience.

20:18.335 --> 20:20.504
You want a reason? I'll give you a reason.

20:20.588 --> 20:23.382
– Right there!
– Aah. You mean Mr. Finch?

20:23.507 --> 20:25.342
Felix fockin' Finch!

20:25.885 --> 20:30.472
That cunt that shat all over me book
in his poncy fockin' magazine!

20:30.598 --> 20:32.975
– It wasn't that bad!
– No?

20:36.145 --> 20:40.441
"Mr. Hoggins should apologize to
the trees failed for the making of his

20:40.566 --> 20:44.820
bloated autobio novel.
Four hundred vain-glorious pages

20:44.945 --> 20:49.658
expire in an ending that is flat
and inane beyond belief."

20:50.576 --> 20:55.497
Steady now, Dermot. What is a critic
but one who reads quickly,

20:55.623 --> 20:58.834
arrogantly, but never wisely.

21:04.340 --> 21:05.799
Fock it.

21:06.592 --> 21:07.885
Dermot!

21:17.519 --> 21:19.271
Ladies and gentlemen!

21:19.980 --> 21:23.567
We have an additional award tonight,
fellow book faeries.

21:23.692 --> 21:26.987
An award for "most eminent critic".

21:27.112 --> 21:30.157
Mr... oh, beg pardon,

21:30.282 --> 21:35.579
SIR! Felix Finch.
O, B and E!

21:39.500 --> 21:42.628
And what might my prize be, I wonder?

21:42.753 --> 21:46.757
A signed copy of an
unpulped "Knuckle Sandwich"?

21:46.882 --> 21:49.176
Can't be many of those left.

21:53.055 --> 21:54.223
Well...

21:55.599 --> 21:58.977
Just what does that lead-less
pencil you call an imagination

21:58.978 --> 22:02.648
have in mind to end this scene. Hmm?

22:08.195 --> 22:10.364
I think you're gonna love this one.

22:20.499 --> 22:24.295
Now, that's an ending that is
flat n'inane beyond belief.

22:28.924 --> 22:30.718
<i>My thoughts?</i>

22:30.843 --> 22:34.471
<i>If I'm honest, I admit that the
obvious emotions like shock</i>

22:34.513 --> 22:37.808
<i>and horror flew as Finch had,
here and gone.</i>

22:37.933 --> 22:39.852
Tequila, couple of fingers.

22:40.436 --> 22:44.105
<i>While deep down,
I experienced a nascent sense</i>

22:44.106 --> 22:48.277
<i>of a silver lining to
this most tragic turn.</i>

22:48.402 --> 22:54.617
<i>Overnight, Dermot "Dusty" Hoggins
became a cult hero to the common man.</i>

22:58.162 --> 23:04.418
<i>"Knuckle Sandwich" shifted ninety
thousand copies in less than two months.</i>

23:04.543 --> 23:07.922
<i>I was for the briefest
of moments, Cinderella,</i>

23:08.047 --> 23:12.760
<i>and all memory of past misfortune
receded in the rearview mirror</i>

23:12.801 --> 23:15.179
<i>of my dream come true.</i>

23:17.765 --> 23:21.560
– What the fuck...
– Tim-o-tee Cavendish... oy presume.

23:21.602 --> 23:23.145
Caught wi' your cacks down!

23:23.854 --> 23:27.190
Uh, my office hours are eleven to two,
and my secretary

23:27.191 --> 23:30.319
would be more than happy to schedule
an appointment if you so desire.

23:30.361 --> 23:32.445
Friends like us don't
need appointments.

23:32.446 --> 23:34.240
We like it all cozy like this.

23:34.365 --> 23:38.118
– Visited Dermot in the joint.
– Our brother's got a question for you.

23:38.244 --> 23:41.163
Where's our focking money?

23:42.540 --> 23:45.209
Boys. Boys, look here.

23:45.584 --> 23:48.586
Dermot signed what we call
a copyright transfer contract,

23:48.587 --> 23:50.047
which means that legally...

23:50.172 --> 23:54.927
Dermot didn't sign a fockin' contract
for the event of a fockin' season!

23:55.052 --> 24:00.391
Er, Perhap-perhaps... er, we could
moot a provisional sum...

24:00.432 --> 24:03.049
as a basis for on-going negotiation.

24:03.133 --> 24:05.218
Okeydokey.

24:06.564 --> 24:09.024
What sum we gonna moot?

24:09.149 --> 24:11.527
Fifty K will do for starters.

24:11.652 --> 24:13.362
Fifty sounds reasonable.

24:13.487 --> 24:15.239
Tomorrow afternoon.

24:15.364 --> 24:17.241
Tomorrow afternoon?

24:17.366 --> 24:19.036
– Cash.
– No bullocks.

24:19.098 --> 24:21.252
– No checks.
– Old fashioned money.

24:21.287 --> 24:22.744
Gentlemen...

24:22.872 --> 24:25.332
– The law says...
– The law?!

24:31.130 --> 24:35.342
What'd the law do
for Felix fockin' Finch?

24:38.345 --> 24:42.266
NEO SEOUL 2144

24:44.351 --> 24:49.106
Ordinarily, I begin by asking prisoners
to recall their earliest memories...

24:50.149 --> 24:54.445
to provide a context for the
corporatic historians of the future.

24:54.570 --> 24:57.823
Fabricants have no such
memories, Archivist.

24:58.908 --> 25:03.746
One twenty-four hour cycle in Papa
Song's is identical to every other.

25:04.580 --> 25:07.708
May I say you speak
Consumer surprisingly well.

25:07.750 --> 25:09.661
[speaks Korean]

25:09.685 --> 25:13.464
<i>It is unfortunate that the officials of
the Unanimity can only speak one language.</i>

25:13.589 --> 25:18.135
As an officer of Unanimity, I am of
course restricted from using sub speak.

25:18.260 --> 25:19.428
Of course.

25:20.638 --> 25:24.558
Please describe a typical
twenty-four hour Papa Song cycle.

25:26.143 --> 25:30.981
At hour four, each server
is woken by auto-stimulin.

25:36.403 --> 25:39.573
From revival, we proceed to the hygiener.

25:43.953 --> 25:47.581
After dressing, we file into the dinery.

25:53.837 --> 25:58.884
At hour five, we man our stations
to greet the new day's consumers.

25:59.009 --> 26:00.927
Welcome to Papa Song's.

26:00.928 --> 26:06.225
For the next nineteen hours,
we input orders, tray food, vend drinks,

26:06.267 --> 26:10.271
upstock condiments, wipe tables,
and bin garbage,

26:10.312 --> 26:13.357
all done in strict adherence
to First Catechism.

26:15.568 --> 26:18.195
What is the First Catechism?

26:18.279 --> 26:20.447
"Honor Thy Consumer."

26:21.949 --> 26:24.076
After the final cleaning,

26:24.201 --> 26:27.955
we imbibe one soap sack
and return to our sleep box.

26:28.789 --> 26:31.750
That is the blueprint
of every single day.

26:32.960 --> 26:35.504
Did you ever think about the future?

26:36.881 --> 26:41.886
Papa Song servers have
just one possible future.

26:42.011 --> 26:44.722
You mean "Exultation".

26:44.847 --> 26:47.725
Could you describe this
annual Rite of Passage?

26:47.850 --> 26:53.814
On first day, Seer Rhee would
stamp a star on each of our collars.

26:54.565 --> 26:57.943
Twelve stars meant an end to our contract.

26:58.068 --> 27:02.114
How did you feel when you watched
one of your sisters ascend?

27:02.239 --> 27:03.782
Excitement.

27:04.074 --> 27:06.285
I was happy for them,

27:06.410 --> 27:08.412
but envious as well.

27:09.079 --> 27:11.957
Did your sister servers feel as you did?

27:13.792 --> 27:15.544
Most of them.

27:17.254 --> 27:21.300
I would like to ask about
the infamous Yoona-939.

27:59.338 --> 28:04.343
If Yoona-939 woke you,
who woke her?

28:05.094 --> 28:07.012
Seer Rhee.

28:07.137 --> 28:10.182
Why would Seer wake a server?

28:10.516 --> 28:13.435
Perhaps you should ask him, Archivist.

28:17.690 --> 28:19.733
What's wrong with him?

28:22.570 --> 28:24.363
He drinks soap.

28:25.447 --> 28:27.366
It makes him happy.

28:29.702 --> 28:33.080
Then he sleep like us in our box.

28:38.335 --> 28:45.217
Do you ever think about... what it must
be like, up there with the consumers?

28:47.511 --> 28:50.639
Third Catechism forbids such questions.

28:50.764 --> 28:53.934
Yes. It does.

28:54.810 --> 28:57.938
Come. Let me show you a secret.

28:59.857 --> 29:02.693
<i>Platform four, Lost and Found.</i>

29:16.916 --> 29:20.002
Now... Sonmia,

29:22.254 --> 29:25.674
we are inside a secret.

29:30.012 --> 29:31.805
A Kino?

29:32.348 --> 29:36.435
– We are not allowed.
– Sonmia, no one will ever know.

29:37.102 --> 29:38.270
Come.

29:50.199 --> 29:54.703
This is a violation of the
ruddy Incarceration Act!

29:54.787 --> 29:58.165
I will not be subjugated
to criminal abuse.

30:02.339 --> 30:06.102
This is a violation of the
ruddy Incarceration Act!

30:06.215 --> 30:10.302
I will not be subjugated
to criminal abuse.

30:12.137 --> 30:14.098
You could have been excised.

30:14.223 --> 30:17.309
How did you justify
such a risk to yourself?

30:17.935 --> 30:19.853
She was my friend.

30:21.397 --> 30:25.985
Please describe the events of
September 18th from your perspective.

30:26.527 --> 30:29.697
I was stationed at pedestal one.

30:54.847 --> 30:58.225
I will not be subjugated
to criminal abuse!

31:37.932 --> 31:42.061
<i>Step away. Code yellow,
the area is secured.</i>

31:45.648 --> 31:49.193
Hawaiian Islands
106 WINTERS AFTER THE FALL

31:49.318 --> 31:54.198
<i>Nay, this life all rot n' lockin'
no smile a' some yawnee.</i>

31:54.323 --> 31:59.370
<i>In rear's time, I ever fest
the secret of Sloosha's hallow.</i>

31:59.495 --> 32:04.583
<i>Adam, my bro' by law, n' his son n' me

32:04.708 --> 32:11.423
<i>It was Adam's custom to cult out
his ancestry with offerin's n' honorin's.</i>

32:18.973 --> 32:25.020
<i>Suddenwise, that fangy
devil's eyes, I felt'em.</i>

32:29.441 --> 32:30.818
Who there?

32:35.698 --> 32:42.079
Ooh, a darky spot you're in, friend.

32:42.121 --> 32:43.122
Ol' Georgie...

32:43.163 --> 32:47.137
Ain't no blade can protect you
from the True-True.

n' his boy by sunup.

33:30.669 --> 33:33.297
You say it all the time, ain'ya?

33:33.422 --> 33:37.134
"The Weak are Meat, the Strong do Eat."

33:45.809 --> 33:48.270
The True-truth, what that is.

34:02.159 --> 34:06.956
<i>Whole valley whisperin' about
the blood o' Adam and his son on my hands.</i>

34:07.081 --> 34:10.751
<i>But Rose and Catkin never
believed those rumors, and stood by me.</i>

34:10.876 --> 34:15.130
– Uncle Zach, look!
– Yeah, I see them.

34:15.880 --> 34:19.134
<i>Prescients come batterin' twice a year,</i>

Yeah. We must go find ya' Ma.

34:43.951 --> 34:47.121

34:48.330 --> 34:50.583
She say we gotta keep out our eyes on ya.

34:52.458 --> 34:54.753
You mindin' me, while I mind the goats?

34:57.506 --> 34:58.465
I see.

35:00.175 --> 35:03.429
Stump is, who's gonna mind
your Ma at the Barter?

35:03.554 --> 35:06.223
She got no tongue for hagglin',
not like you and me.

35:06.348 --> 35:07.766
Sure you alright?

35:07.892 --> 35:10.603
Swear by. Be home for suppin'.

<i>Why words slink n' slide off a tongue,

35:30.080 --> 35:33.626

– Special guest hosting.

35:33.751 --> 35:36.795
Thank you for the kindsome hostin'

35:36.921 --> 35:39.131
I ain't saysoe this, Rose.

35:39.256 --> 35:43.510

– She can be hostin' then?

35:46.639 --> 35:48.557
I brin' you gift, Zachry.

35:49.850 --> 35:52.269
Need no gift from the stranger.

36:14.333 --> 36:17.460
<i>No one queried what fusion engine was,</i>

<i>cos they didn't want to look

<i>True really was, Meronym
answered the questions,</i>

36:29.014 --> 36:32.810
<i>All o' that answerin' done was

36:43.279 --> 36:46.699
Watch her, watch her close.

36:47.783 --> 36:51.120
She's got secrets.

37:38.375 --> 37:39.043
Zachry Bailey?

37:39.084 --> 37:41.670
Sorrysome for wakin'
you up but... a dream.

37:42.213 --> 37:44.256
Some diresome's gonna happen.

37:44.381 --> 37:45.674
Come in, come in.

37:47.259 --> 37:50.387
Ooh, let Sonmi guide your heart.

37:51.096 --> 37:53.891
Ohh, I gonna hear it for us,

37:54.016 --> 37:56.393
I'm prayin' for you.

37:56.815 --> 38:01.148
Ooh, Old Georgie's
hungerin' for your soul.

38:01.232 --> 38:03.192
Ooh, I knew it.

38:03.776 --> 38:06.946
Spit a cuss on your dreams.

38:14.370 --> 38:17.665
"Bridge is broken, hide below"

38:17.790 --> 38:20.459
"Hands are bleedin', can't let go"

38:20.584 --> 38:24.505
"Enemy's sleepin', don't slit that throat"

38:26.048 --> 38:27.508
An augurin'...

38:33.639 --> 38:35.724
Trust Sonmi...

38:37.017 --> 38:42.439
Keep her warnin' with you,
nail it to your memory.

38:43.899 --> 38:47.903
Thank you. Thank you, Abbess.
Thank you.

39:15.222 --> 39:17.182
Wait! Wait.

39:18.267 --> 39:21.186
There's... no reason to hide.

39:23.397 --> 39:27.860
I know you are... Sonmi-451.

39:30.070 --> 39:33.240
My name is... Hae-Ju Zheng.

39:34.158 --> 39:37.494
What has happened to Seer Rhee?

39:37.620 --> 39:39.997
Soap overdose.

39:40.122 --> 39:44.543
It is unfortunate that it had to happen
with everything gone so well.

39:45.294 --> 39:47.378
Cos now it is probable
that the Enforcers

39:47.379 --> 39:50.132
and the DNA sniffers
will find out about you.

39:50.758 --> 39:52.301
And if they do...

39:52.343 --> 39:56.472
if they realize your connection
to Yoona-939, you will be excised.

39:58.182 --> 40:00.226
But you have a choice.

40:01.060 --> 40:05.481
You can remain here
and risk being discovered,

40:07.942 --> 40:09.693
or you can come with me.

40:22.456 --> 40:24.792
– Bear away, boy.
– Aye, aye captain.

40:28.337 --> 40:31.924
<i>Friday the 15th. We made sail
with the morning tide.</i>

40:32.967 --> 40:35.511
<i>Mr. Boerhaave had my cabin changed.</i>

40:35.636 --> 40:40.057
<i>I have been quarantined to a store room
away from the other passengers and crew.</i>

40:40.182 --> 40:44.061
<i>Henry argued in vain that the
Polynesian worm was not contagious.</i>

40:44.186 --> 40:45.563
<i>Not that it matters.</i>

40:45.646 --> 40:47.062
<i>All I want to do now is return home</i>

40:47.063 --> 40:49.316
<i>and unburden myself
from this responsibility.</i>

40:52.528 --> 40:56.198
<i>My dear Sixsmith, I am in
desperate need of your help.</i>

40:56.323 --> 40:59.410
<i>After my last letter, I'm sure
you're rushing to pack your bags,</i>

40:59.451 --> 41:00.995
<i>but you needn't, really.</i>

41:01.120 --> 41:06.000
<i>Unless of course, you wish to witness
the rebirth of Robert Frobisher.</i>

41:07.751 --> 41:14.717
<i>Is it not miraculous how one's fortune
can turn so quickly, so completely.</i>

41:15.009 --> 41:18.053
<i>One moment, leaping from
a hotel window, the next</i>

41:18.137 --> 41:22.182
<i>gainfully employed by one of the
world's greatest living composers.</i>

41:23.225 --> 41:26.478
<i>My only problem is that I
accidentally got hooked on a journal</i>

41:26.604 --> 41:29.439
<i>written in 1849 by a dying
lawyer during the voyage</i>

41:29.440 --> 41:32.151
<i>from the Pacific islands
to San Francisco.</i>

41:32.735 --> 41:35.904
<i>To my great annoyance,
the pages cease mid-sentence.</i>

41:35.905 --> 41:39.073
<i>Half the book is missing.
It's completely killing me.</i>

41:39.074 --> 41:41.076
<i>Could you be a mensch and when
you're next foraging</i>

41:41.077 --> 41:43.120
<i>at Otto's Book's, make an inquiry?</i>

41:43.579 --> 41:49.293
<i>A half finished book is, after all,
a half finished love affair.</i>

41:55.382 --> 41:59.011
America loves oil.

41:59.136 --> 42:02.556
America is addicted to oil.

42:02.681 --> 42:07.311
Some fantasize about
wind turbines or peat gas.

42:08.270 --> 42:11.541
But I'm here today to
tell you that the cure

42:11.580 --> 42:16.403
for oil is right here.
The cure is nuclear power.

42:16.528 --> 42:18.906
The cure is Swannekke.

42:26.997 --> 42:31.043
<i>Hello, Miss Rey. I'm frightfully
sorry for calling you at this hour.</i>

42:31.377 --> 42:33.254
Dr. Sixsmith?

42:33.379 --> 42:34.421
<i>I need help.</i>

42:35.089 --> 42:40.093
I need £ 50,000, not 2,000, 50,000!

42:40.094 --> 42:42.763
<i>I'm going through it again,
Mr. Cavendish, but the total's right.</i>

42:42.805 --> 42:45.182
<i>2,343 pounds and 16 pence.</i>

42:45.266 --> 42:49.228
How is this possible?
The ruddy money was pouring in.

42:49.311 --> 42:52.898
<i>Debts mostly, Mr. Cavendish.
Solvency has its drawbacks.</i>

42:54.900 --> 42:56.943
<i>The situation looked dire,</i>

42:56.944 --> 43:01.532
<i>but I knew that Timothy
Cavendish's capital in this town</i>

43:01.657 --> 43:04.618
<i>could not be defined by
an accountant's balance sheet!</i>

43:04.660 --> 43:05.870
McCluskie!

43:05.995 --> 43:08.789
Look, how are those
delightful kiddies of yours?

43:10.499 --> 43:16.463
Mon cher, tis "Cavendish the Ravenous,"
your favorite Timothy.

43:18.090 --> 43:18.674
Mon cher?

43:18.716 --> 43:21.594
You heard it correctly,
Charles Dickens' own original

43:21.635 --> 43:25.639
authentic writing desk for £ 60,000.
I think that's very fair.

43:25.723 --> 43:28.350
<i>But our records indicate that the
desk is already accounted for</i>

43:28.392 --> 43:29.852
<i>by the Dickens House Museum.</i>

43:29.853 --> 43:32.771
Okay, what about
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's desk?

43:40.487 --> 43:44.491
<i>In the darkness, I suddenly saw the light.</i>

43:44.617 --> 43:47.328
<i>Blood has always trumped water.</i>

43:47.494 --> 43:50.831
<i>If the Hogginses brutes wanted
to turn this into a family affair,</i>

43:51.123 --> 43:56.128
<i>they'd find the Cavendish Clan
more than ready for the task at hand.</i>

43:57.838 --> 44:00.925
Oh, Satan's gonads, not again.
Look,

44:00.966 --> 44:04.345
just bugger off and leave us in peace.
I'm only gonna asking you nicely once.

44:04.386 --> 44:05.429
Good to see you, Denny.

44:05.471 --> 44:08.599
I'm not lending you a ruddy farthing
until you pay back the last lot.

44:08.807 --> 44:12.061
Why-Why should I be forever
giving you a hand out?

44:12.228 --> 44:13.687
Denny...

44:14.230 --> 44:16.941
I had a minor running with the wrong sort.

44:17.066 --> 44:21.403
If I don't get my hands on £ 60,000,
I got to get an awful beating.

44:21.445 --> 44:24.281
Well, get them to video it for us,
would you? Now fuck off.

44:24.615 --> 44:27.826
– I'm not joking, Denholme.
– Why is this my problem?

44:27.952 --> 44:31.163
Because we're brothers!
Don't you have a conscience?

44:31.872 --> 44:35.626
Couple of my special little pills
and a G&T should just set me right.

44:35.751 --> 44:38.254
Denny. Help.

44:40.756 --> 44:42.007
Please.

44:43.467 --> 44:45.302
Den, who are you talking to?

44:45.761 --> 44:49.431
– Hello, Georgette.
– Hello, Timothy.

44:54.436 --> 44:56.730
Right. Right, right.

44:56.772 --> 44:58.023
What did you-60 grand?

44:58.065 --> 44:59.942
It's gonna take some time, but, uh...

44:59.984 --> 45:02.778
in the interim, I've got
the perfect place for you to hide.

45:05.698 --> 45:10.035
<i>I begun to fear I might never hold
my beloved Tilda in my arms again.</i>

45:10.995 --> 45:15.082
<i>My parasite writhes at night,
igniting spasms of pain,</i>

45:15.374 --> 45:18.377
<i>while visions and voices,
obscene and monstrous, haunt me.</i>

45:18.419 --> 45:20.254
Mister Ewing...

45:20.796 --> 45:22.339
In the name of God!

45:24.091 --> 45:26.135
Mister Ewing, no fear.

45:26.260 --> 45:28.304
No harm, no shout.

45:28.429 --> 45:31.599
Please.
My name Autua.

45:31.724 --> 45:35.436
You know I... see Maori whip I...

45:36.437 --> 45:37.813
You know I.

45:40.482 --> 45:44.153
– What do you want?
– You help, Mr. Ewing.

45:44.278 --> 45:47.406
If you no help, I in trouble dead.

45:47.531 --> 45:50.242
Well, you're already
very much "in trouble dead."

45:50.367 --> 45:51.952
The Prophetess is a mercantile vessel,

45:51.953 --> 45:54.371
not an underground railroad
for escaping slaves.

45:54.622 --> 45:57.708
I be able seaman, I earn passage.

45:57.833 --> 46:00.753
Well, then I suggest you surrender
to the captain's mercies forthwith.

46:00.836 --> 46:04.131
No, no. They no hear I.

46:04.715 --> 46:08.636
They say "swim away home, nigger",
and throw I in drink, but you...

46:08.677 --> 46:12.514
you law man, right? Please.
Captain hear you, Mr. Ewing.

46:12.556 --> 46:14.516
I-I can't help you.

46:14.642 --> 46:19.146
I'm afraid your fate is entirely
your own, and I desire no part in it.

46:20.731 --> 46:22.691
Then kill I.

46:22.733 --> 46:24.568
Don't be absurd...

46:24.985 --> 46:29.573
If you no help, you kill I just the same,
is true. You know it.

46:29.698 --> 46:32.243
I ain't be no fish food, Mr. Ewing.

46:32.284 --> 46:35.913
Die here better.
Do it.

46:36.914 --> 46:38.707
Do it quick.

46:39.750 --> 46:42.378
I found an old transway marker, Captain.

46:43.254 --> 46:45.005
It's got to be the red mountain.

46:46.173 --> 46:48.300
The problem is, the valley
people are afraid of it.

46:48.301 --> 46:50.469
They think the Devil lives up there.

46:50.594 --> 46:54.181
I can't find anybody to guide me
through the Kona territory.

46:54.306 --> 46:55.849
Meronym...

46:56.392 --> 46:59.812
Every day you're out there,
you increase your RAD levels.

46:59.937 --> 47:03.607
This dream of yours is going to kill you.
And for what?

47:03.691 --> 47:06.986
The Off-World colonies
may no longer exist.

47:07.403 --> 47:08.821
I got to go, Captain.

47:11.240 --> 47:13.659
Thank you for coming, I'm in 1404.

47:13.742 --> 47:15.870
<i>I'll be right up.</i>

47:54.992 --> 47:57.161
Dr. Sixsmith?

48:09.381 --> 48:10.883
It's me, Luisa.

48:58.097 --> 49:00.766
Go call the police.
Right now, call the police!

49:37.177 --> 49:41.891
<i>My dear Sixsmith, you alone can
understand how I'm feeling right now.</i>

49:42.016 --> 49:47.021
<i>Today, Ayrs and I presented our first
collaboration to Tadeusz Kesselring,</i>

49:47.146 --> 49:49.899
<i>Ayrs favorite conductor
who arrived from Berlin.</i>

49:50.858 --> 49:54.277
<i>It's called "eternal recurrence".
Wish you could hear it.</i>

49:54.278 --> 49:57.363
<i>It's the most accomplished tone poem
I know of written since the war,</i>

49:57.364 --> 49:58.824
<i>and I tell you, Sixsmith,</i>

49:58.825 --> 50:02.286
<i>that more than of the few
of its best ideas are mine.</i>

50:06.290 --> 50:13.047
At our time of life, Ayrs,
a man has no right to such daring ideas.

50:14.882 --> 50:20.846
I suppose I've won a rearguard action
or two in my war against decrepitude.

50:20.971 --> 50:24.725
<i>Diner of pheasant with
Bordeaux rich as buttercream.</i>

50:24.850 --> 50:27.518
<i>How I love to listen to men
of distinguished lives,</i>

50:27.519 --> 50:30.648
<i>sing of past follies and glories.</i>

50:30.773 --> 50:34.610
<i>The only broken note in the entire
evening was Ayrs wife, Jocasta,</i>

50:34.652 --> 50:37.321
<i>excusing herself early.</i>

50:38.155 --> 50:41.867
<i>Sensed the buried bone.
Later I asked Ayrs about it.</i>

50:41.992 --> 50:45.371
<i>He said Kesselring had
introduced Jocasta to him.</i>

50:45.454 --> 50:48.958
<i>I pried, had Kesselring
been in love with her?</i>

50:49.333 --> 50:51.418
<i>The subject was a prickly one.</i>

50:51.460 --> 50:53.546
Jocasta is a Jew.

50:53.754 --> 50:56.465
Obviously her relationship was impossible.

50:56.590 --> 50:58.259
Why obviously?

50:59.426 --> 51:04.390
Can you really be so ignorant
of what is happening in Germany?

51:04.974 --> 51:08.477
<i>At this point in my life,
all I know, Sixsmith,</i>

51:08.602 --> 51:13.148
<i>is that this world spins
from the same unseen forces</i>

51:13.190 --> 51:15.234
<i>that twist our hearts.</i>

51:16.360 --> 51:19.446
– How is it, Mr. Zachry?
– Thin whiles.

51:20.114 --> 51:22.783
– Minding some company?
– Nay.

51:23.200 --> 51:24.493
But...

51:24.743 --> 51:28.998
Goats, and so do herders,
they're known for housin' temper.

51:30.791 --> 51:33.210
Feelin' that own n' your reveal count out,

51:33.252 --> 51:35.963
for invadin' your house with no saysoe.

51:36.088 --> 51:37.798
True sorrysome.

51:39.008 --> 51:41.135
Well it... Now it's done.

51:41.760 --> 51:46.682
So, you mindin' a stranger
coverin' about your thrivin'?

51:46.807 --> 51:49.935
Swap you. Query for query.

51:52.229 --> 51:53.689
Fair buy.

51:53.772 --> 51:58.110
Cog you and come dow.
Learn stitchin' n' milkin' our heardin'.

51:59.653 --> 52:01.488
Why you here?

52:01.989 --> 52:04.033
I needin' a guide.

52:04.700 --> 52:06.994
Guide? To where?

52:08.245 --> 52:10.289
Mauna Sol.

52:17.755 --> 52:20.799
<i>"Bridge is broken, hide below"</i>

52:22.843 --> 52:24.303
What's wrong?

52:53.874 --> 52:58.003
<i>We cross and recross
our old tracks like figure skaters.</i>

52:58.045 --> 53:01.006
<i>And just as I was reading
a new submission,</i>

53:01.298 --> 53:04.176
<i>a powerful déjà-vu ran through my bones.</i>

53:06.220 --> 53:08.806
<i>I had been here before.</i>

53:09.181 --> 53:11.559
<i>Another lifetime ago.</i>

53:12.893 --> 53:14.311
<i>Ursula.</i>

53:15.688 --> 53:18.315
<i>The love of my life.</i>

53:18.440 --> 53:21.193
<i>I could think of no other
serious applicants.</i>

53:22.027 --> 53:24.530
<i>What had happened to her?</i>

53:24.655 --> 53:26.615
<i>And more importantly,</i>

53:26.740 --> 53:28.701
<i>what had happened to the young man</i>

53:28.742 --> 53:32.162
<i>who had ridden the same train
composing sonnets,</i>

53:32.788 --> 53:35.457
<i>to his so bound a love.</i>

53:35.791 --> 53:37.793
Your augurin' come true, Abbess.

53:37.918 --> 53:39.711
Broke bridge, just like you say.

53:39.712 --> 53:43.007
Meronym were there, yebberin' about
trackin' up Mauna Sol,

53:43.132 --> 53:46.260
why can this Prescient woman
come cursin' n' twistin' on my life?

53:46.385 --> 53:48.721
Mind the words of Sonmi.

53:51.265 --> 53:54.935
"Our lives are not our own.

53:55.811 --> 53:59.565
From womb to tomb, we are bound to others.

54:00.941 --> 54:04.153
Past and present.

54:06.113 --> 54:08.365
And by each crime...

54:10.284 --> 54:12.953
and every kindness...

54:13.829 --> 54:15.873
we birth our future."

54:24.089 --> 54:27.134
Welcome to Neo Seoul.

54:39.730 --> 54:41.398
Come on, out you come.

54:42.650 --> 54:45.443
This... maybe the biggest mistake
of my life, but here.

54:45.444 --> 54:47.529
Thank you, Mr. Ewing.

54:50.658 --> 54:53.409
Now to tell the truth, I was
worried you might try and eat me,

54:53.410 --> 54:55.246
if you didn't get
something in the stomach.

54:55.579 --> 54:57.706
Oh, you safe, Mr. Ewing.

54:57.831 --> 54:59.708
I no like white meat.

55:01.961 --> 55:03.837
Ah. Right.

55:05.172 --> 55:08.425
Before I decide what
I'm going to do with you,

55:09.802 --> 55:12.596
tell me why you were
being whipped so savagely?

55:12.721 --> 55:15.224
My uncle was a sailor.

55:15.349 --> 55:18.602
He took me on a French whaler
when I was ten years old.

55:18.727 --> 55:20.938
Seen too much of the world.

55:21.605 --> 55:23.440
I no good slave.

55:25.025 --> 55:27.152
Why did you look at me?

55:28.779 --> 55:30.573
Pain strong, aye.

55:31.365 --> 55:33.492
Friend's eye more strong.

55:34.076 --> 55:38.038
Look, you are a runaway slave,
and I am a lawyer.

55:38.831 --> 55:41.333
How did you imagine
we could possibly be friends?

55:46.630 --> 55:48.007
All you need.

55:58.475 --> 55:59.810
Ah, Jesus!

55:59.935 --> 56:02.754
Javier Gomez, what did I tell you
about jumping onto my balcony?

56:02.777 --> 56:05.315
Why d'you leave the door open
if you don't want me to come in?

56:05.316 --> 56:06.400
Because, smarty pants,

56:06.525 --> 56:09.068
the only thing worse than having
you jumping onto my balcony,

56:09.069 --> 56:12.448
is the idea of you jumping onto my
balcony, and being stuck out there.

56:12.531 --> 56:13.657
Okay!

56:15.075 --> 56:16.619
What are you reading?

56:19.997 --> 56:21.373
Old letters.

56:21.916 --> 56:27.213
<i>Sixsmith, the plot has
taken a sensual turn.</i>

56:27.630 --> 56:30.548
<i>Last week, Jocasta and I became lovers.</i>

56:30.549 --> 56:34.553
<i>But don't alarm yourself, it is only
a carnal act, performed in service,</i>

56:34.887 --> 56:37.389
<i>not unlike my role as amanuensis.</i>

56:38.265 --> 56:43.729
<i>And I confess women's hearts like
their desire remain a mystery to me.</i>

56:47.024 --> 56:51.278
<i>Afterward, she cried and thanked me
for bringing life back into their home.</i>

56:51.403 --> 56:55.241
<i>I can get clear that Vyvyan
had been there the entire night,</i>

56:55.366 --> 57:00.579
<i>between us like the silence between notes,
that holds the key to warm music.</i>

57:03.624 --> 57:06.293
<i>P.S.: Best news of all,</i>

57:06.752 --> 57:08.921
<i>I've started my own work.</i>

57:14.176 --> 57:18.806
Uh, I... called about an old recording,

57:18.847 --> 57:21.976
written by a man named Robert Frobisher.

57:22.476 --> 57:24.728
Oops. Busted.

57:25.563 --> 57:27.564
I know I shouldn't be playing it, I was...

57:27.565 --> 57:29.733
checking it to make sure
it wasn't scratched,

57:29.858 --> 57:33.194
but... honestly,

57:33.195 --> 57:35.364
I just can't stop listening to it.

57:35.489 --> 57:37.741
This is the Cloud Atlas Sextet?

57:39.567 --> 57:41.453
It's... the symphony.

57:47.001 --> 57:48.794
It's beautiful.

57:48.919 --> 57:51.212
but I think I've heard this before.

57:51.213 --> 57:53.549
I can't imagine how.

57:53.674 --> 57:57.803
I doubt there's no more than a... handful
copies in the whole of North America.

57:57.928 --> 57:59.471
But I know it.

58:01.724 --> 58:03.559
I know I know it.

58:04.018 --> 58:10.065
<i>Before I realized it, my feet had brought
me back to the Temple of Sacrifice,</i>

58:10.190 --> 58:12.443
<i>where I offered up my virginity.</i>

58:12.568 --> 58:15.321
<i>Back to those four-days of Paradise,</i>

58:15.362 --> 58:19.116
<i>when Ursula's Mater and Pater
slift off to Greece,</i>

58:19.283 --> 58:21.118
<i>for a long weekend...</i>

58:24.538 --> 58:26.665
<i>Or so we thought.</i>

58:28.459 --> 58:29.627
Ursula!

58:33.297 --> 58:37.259
Sir! Madam! I assure you
this is completely innocent...

58:41.555 --> 58:44.475
<i>Two sprained ankles, one cracked rib.</i>

58:44.600 --> 58:47.937
<i>Official cause of accident,
listed on hospital form...</i>

58:48.062 --> 58:49.021
<i>pussy.</i>

58:53.025 --> 58:56.528
<i>What were the chances that
she still lived in this house?</i>

58:58.447 --> 59:00.908
<i>And yet, there she was.</i>

59:01.742 --> 59:03.077
<i>Ursula.</i>

59:04.036 --> 59:07.790
<i>Why had I never returned
her calls or letters?</i>

59:07.915 --> 59:12.878
<i>Shame, spinessless,
hallmarks of the Cavendish clan.</i>

59:14.046 --> 59:19.260
<i>I realized I had a choice. I could
slink off and continue as planned,</i>

59:19.385 --> 59:21.398
<i>or I could go boldly to the door,</i>

59:21.406 --> 59:24.390
 and discover what hope,
if any, would lay within.

59:26.308 --> 59:28.227
Abbess, come quick,
it's the Bailey girl.

59:28.352 --> 59:30.396
– Catkin?
– Aye, she dyin'.

59:34.855 --> 59:36.675
– What-what...
– Zach.

59:40.447 --> 59:42.866
– Sonmi...
– It's scorpion fish.

59:43.492 --> 59:46.287
Healer said she be gone by sundown.

59:46.412 --> 59:49.582
Ain't right, ain't fair,
but nothing to be done.

59:58.465 --> 01:00:00.426
Be very still.

01:00:00.551 --> 01:00:03.304
Termination charge.
Here!

01:00:03.762 --> 01:00:07.391
Just enough to blow your carotid.

01:00:34.084 --> 01:00:35.794
How does it feel?

01:00:37.963 --> 01:00:39.340
Good.

01:00:43.135 --> 01:00:44.762
Catkin's dying!

01:00:45.763 --> 01:00:47.681
– What?
– She trod on a scorpion fish.

01:00:49.558 --> 01:00:52.185
You can save her.
You got spesh smart in that gearbag,

01:00:52.186 --> 01:00:54.813
that'll save her.
That's the True-true!

01:00:54.939 --> 01:00:58.108
Prescient Councils swear
by a special order.

01:00:58.234 --> 01:01:01.194
Say I can't go play Lady Sonmi
for everythin' twistin' wrong,

01:01:01.195 --> 01:01:04.198
and click fingers, make right.

01:01:04.323 --> 01:01:07.450
I just a stupid goat herder but
I cog you're killin' Catkin by not actin',

01:01:07.451 --> 01:01:11.247
just... by lettin' you up on that bridge,
you Kona meat.

01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:17.461
If a Prescient be layin',
with poison meltin' her heart n'lungs?

01:01:17.545 --> 01:01:19.547
If it be your kin?

01:01:20.881 --> 01:01:23.717
Why the Precient's life worth
more than a Valleysman?!

01:01:33.352 --> 01:01:35.771
I'll take you to Mauna Sol.

01:01:35.896 --> 01:01:37.982
I know the way!

01:01:38.023 --> 01:01:40.109
If you save Catkin,

01:01:40.818 --> 01:01:44.321
I will guide you to the Devil's door,
if that's where you wanna go.

01:01:49.410 --> 01:01:54.248
<i>While the past may call to us
with the enchantment of a siren,</i>

01:01:54.373 --> 01:01:58.794
<i>better, I believed, to stay
the course set by dear brother Den.</i>

01:01:58.919 --> 01:02:00.921
Just sign right here.

01:02:04.258 --> 01:02:09.263
<i>Tomorrow, life could begin
afresh, afresh, afresh.</i>

01:02:09.388 --> 01:02:10.514
This way.

01:02:15.519 --> 01:02:16.437
Come.

01:02:30.534 --> 01:02:32.119
<i>Designating texture.</i>

01:02:44.173 --> 01:02:46.342
That's old Seoul.

01:02:47.426 --> 01:02:49.511
If the tides keep rising
at their present rate,

01:02:49.553 --> 01:02:52.389
Neo-Seoul will also be under
water in a hundred years.

01:03:26.507 --> 01:03:28.842
Your food is in here.

01:03:29.635 --> 01:03:33.055
It's not what you're used to,
but I think you will like it.

01:03:34.265 --> 01:03:35.975
This is your bed...

01:03:37.351 --> 01:03:39.395
These are your clothes.

01:03:43.065 --> 01:03:47.611
Mine? But these are...
Pureblood clothes.

01:03:47.736 --> 01:03:50.155
No. They are yours.

01:03:51.031 --> 01:03:53.450
Did you know he was Union?

01:03:53.576 --> 01:03:56.412
No, but it wouldn't have mattered.

01:03:56.537 --> 01:03:58.372
Why not?

01:03:58.497 --> 01:04:00.207
Because...

01:04:00.332 --> 01:04:04.378
It was the first time
a Pureblood had showed me kindness.

01:04:11.969 --> 01:04:13.637
I hungry.

01:04:38.537 --> 01:04:40.206
Do you like them?

01:04:42.833 --> 01:04:44.418
You look lovely.

01:04:45.461 --> 01:04:47.004
Here...

01:04:48.589 --> 01:04:50.132
Come here.

01:04:51.508 --> 01:04:55.387
Now, this used to play Vidis,
but the chip is corrupted.

01:04:55.512 --> 01:04:59.099
Stuck in a loop, so I digit it
and found the rest of it.

01:04:59.225 --> 01:05:00.851
The rest of it?

01:05:19.119 --> 01:05:21.609
...the bloody hell are
you doing in my room?

01:05:21.632 --> 01:05:26.335
Keys... go walkies, let's give these
to Miss Judd for safekeeping, shall we?

01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:29.797
Leave my things alone,
you pilvering cow.

01:05:30.506 --> 01:05:35.761
Cause you're new, I shall not make
you eat soap powder, this time...

01:05:35.844 --> 01:05:36.887
You're warned.

01:05:36.971 --> 01:05:41.100
I cannot stand for offensive language
in our arrays, not from anyone.

01:05:41.225 --> 01:05:44.728
And I never make idle threats,
Mr. Cavendish. Never.

01:05:44.770 --> 01:05:47.982
I'll talk to you as I ruddy
will like, you thief!

01:05:48.107 --> 01:05:51.860
Make me eat soap powder?
I'd like to see you try.

01:05:53.269 --> 01:05:55.155
Ooh, bloody hell!

01:05:56.115 --> 01:05:58.784
A disappointing start.

01:05:58.909 --> 01:06:02.580
Is this some sort of kinky S&M hotel?

01:06:02.705 --> 01:06:07.793
I am nurse Noakes,
you do not wish to cross me.

01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:18.137
I am so sorry to keep you waiting.
Uh, I know it's a Miss...

01:06:18.262 --> 01:06:19.388
Rey.

01:06:19.513 --> 01:06:23.142
– Luisa Rey, Spyglass magazine.
– Right, right.

01:06:23.267 --> 01:06:26.979
Luisa, this is Joe Napier,
our security chief.

01:06:27.104 --> 01:06:29.315
I was surprised to get your query.

01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:32.484
I mean, don't get me wrong,
it-it is a feisty magazine, but...

01:06:32.610 --> 01:06:34.403
Anything you need,
sir, just let me know.

01:06:34.445 --> 01:06:37.031
We'll do. Guys, I'm good,
thank you very much.

01:06:37.948 --> 01:06:40.450
Our editor's trying to
spice things up a little bit,

01:06:40.451 --> 01:06:42.912
he says the public wants
more substance, so...

01:06:43.037 --> 01:06:44.330
Probably just a fad.

01:06:45.915 --> 01:06:49.043
Come on, follow me, let's start
you with the Chicken Ranch.

01:06:49.168 --> 01:06:50.961
That is where we keep the Eggheads.

01:07:01.096 --> 01:07:04.516
Hello, Mr. Cavendish,
feeling super this morning?

01:07:04.642 --> 01:07:09.188
No. I checked in last night,
believing that Aurora House was a hotel.

01:07:09.313 --> 01:07:13.275
My brother made the booking you see,
his idea of a practical joke.

01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:17.488
But listen, you have a bigger problem
closer to home.

01:07:17.613 --> 01:07:20.990
There's some demented bitch
calling herself Noakes,

01:07:20.991 --> 01:07:25.037
rampaging about the place,
impersonating a chamber maid.

01:07:25.663 --> 01:07:30.876
But the point is this:
she struck me, and she stole my keys.

01:07:33.212 --> 01:07:36.632
Right? I'll need those
keys back, straight away.

01:07:37.716 --> 01:07:41.762
Aurora House is your home now,
Mr. Cavendish. Your signature

01:07:41.887 --> 01:07:44.265
– authorizes us to apply...
– Signature?

01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:47.601
The custody document
you signed last night.

01:07:47.726 --> 01:07:49.687
Your residency papers.

01:07:49.728 --> 01:07:53.315
Oh no, no, no. That was
the hotel register.

01:07:53.357 --> 01:07:56.277
Ah, never mind, it's all academic, huh?

01:07:56.402 --> 01:07:59.071
This is gonna make a hell
of a diner party story.

01:07:59.113 --> 01:08:02.616
Most of our guests get cold feet
on their first mornings.

01:08:02.741 --> 01:08:04.660
– My keys, please.

01:08:04.702 --> 01:08:08.122
– Residents are not...
– I'm not a ruddy resident!

01:08:08.247 --> 01:08:11.166
You'll find temper tantrums
won't help you at Aurora House!

01:08:11.292 --> 01:08:14.169
You're breaking the... ruddy...

01:08:16.255 --> 01:08:19.133
acting... conservation act,
or some ruddy thing,

01:08:19.258 --> 01:08:22.761
and I will not be subjugated
to a criminal abuse.

01:08:25.305 --> 01:08:29.727
I will not be subjugated
to criminal abuse.

01:08:35.858 --> 01:08:41.029
<i>Outside, fat snow flakes
are forming on slate roofs.</i>

01:08:41.154 --> 01:08:47.411
<i>Like Solzhenitsyn laboring in Vermont,
I shall beaver away in exile.</i>

01:08:47.536 --> 01:08:52.124
<i>Unlike Solzhenitsyn, I shan't be alone.</i>

01:09:00.674 --> 01:09:02.218
Off somewhere?

01:09:02.593 --> 01:09:05.888
You bet I am.
To the land of the living.

01:09:07.765 --> 01:09:14.688
Soylent Green is people.
Soylent Green is made of people!

01:09:16.607 --> 01:09:19.068
Oy! Get back here, you!

01:09:21.237 --> 01:09:23.904
You keep away from me, or
I'll be forced to name you,

01:09:23.906 --> 01:09:25.908
in the police report, as an accomplice.

01:09:26.033 --> 01:09:27.785
I have better things to do than this.

01:09:28.202 --> 01:09:32.331
Then go, pit and do them,
you bloody sucker son of...

01:09:34.082 --> 01:09:35.501
Right!

01:09:38.546 --> 01:09:42.216
God, you take hands off me,
you ruddy bloody...

01:09:44.718 --> 01:09:50.015
You can maintain power over people,
as long as you give them something.

01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:55.187
Rob a man of everything, and that
man will no longer be in your power.

01:09:56.021 --> 01:10:00.150
Alexander Solzhenitsyn,
20th century philosopher complete works,

01:10:00.401 --> 01:10:02.611
banned by Unanimity.

01:10:02.736 --> 01:10:05.447
How do you know about him?

01:10:05.573 --> 01:10:06.865
Hae-Ju.

01:10:09.785 --> 01:10:13.080
– Sir Zheng.
– Please, you must call me Hae-Ju.

01:10:14.248 --> 01:10:15.416
Hae-Ju...

01:10:17.668 --> 01:10:20.963
Fabricants can be excised for this...

01:10:21.714 --> 01:10:25.092
Well, survival often demands some courage.

01:10:41.984 --> 01:10:45.654
<i>Knowledge is a mirror,
and for the first time in my life,</i>

01:10:45.696 --> 01:10:50.743
<i>I was allowed to see who I was,
and who I might become.</i>

01:10:58.375 --> 01:11:00.294
Go clean the head.

01:11:01.545 --> 01:11:02.838
Good morning, captain.

01:11:02.839 --> 01:11:07.009
You can help it remain so,
Quillcock, by buggering off.

01:11:07.134 --> 01:11:09.595
I'm afraid I can't do it, sir.

01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:12.764
If I was, I would be unable
to inform you of the stow-away

01:11:12.765 --> 01:11:14.934
– that I have discovered in my...
– Stow-away?

01:11:15.017 --> 01:11:17.561
I assure you that this
Moriori had no choice.

01:11:18.103 --> 01:11:21.232
Now he has sworn to me that he is
a first class, able bodied seaman,

01:11:21.273 --> 01:11:23.609
capable of earning passage
if only given a chance.

01:11:23.651 --> 01:11:29.031
A stow-away is a stow-away,
even if he shits silver nuggets.

01:11:30.532 --> 01:11:33.994
Did he ever explain anything to you?

01:11:34.119 --> 01:11:39.792
He told me their goal was
the creation of a free willed Fabricant.

01:11:41.502 --> 01:11:43.546
Yoona had failed.

01:11:44.296 --> 01:11:46.382
I was their last hope.

01:11:50.928 --> 01:11:54.639
I have to say if all lady
journalists look like you,

01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:58.936
I might start to take this, uh,
women's lib thing more seriously.

01:11:59.061 --> 01:12:01.981
Well, I'm sure they can use your support.

01:12:03.232 --> 01:12:04.525
Nice.

01:12:04.650 --> 01:12:08.779
Okay, uh, you wait here and I will
go find someone smarter who can, uh,

01:12:08.821 --> 01:12:11.240
walk you through the details
of some of your questions.

01:12:11.282 --> 01:12:12.449
Great.

01:12:32.386 --> 01:12:33.846
What would Dad do?

01:12:42.646 --> 01:12:45.649
Who the bloody hell is this?
Have you any idea what time it is?

01:12:45.774 --> 01:12:48.193
– Denny, it's me, Tim.
<i>- Timothee?</i>

01:12:49.695 --> 01:12:50.738
Where are you?

01:12:50.863 --> 01:12:54.033
<i>Ah, I think you ruddy know
about where I am.</i>

01:12:54.158 --> 01:12:56.619
But residents are
denied access to phones.

01:12:56.702 --> 01:12:58.037
<i>Someone smuggled one in?</i>

01:12:58.579 --> 01:13:01.832
– You know the rules?
<i>- I helped write them, Timmy.</i>

01:13:01.957 --> 01:13:05.294
<i>I have been a principal investor
in Aurora House for twelve years,</i>

01:13:05.419 --> 01:13:06.587
it's incredibly lucrative.

01:13:06.629 --> 01:13:10.174
You can't believe what people would pay
to lock-out their parents.

01:13:11.926 --> 01:13:13.594
Look, Den, you've had your fun,

01:13:13.886 --> 01:13:17.181
I think it's high time you put an end
to this little game of yours.

01:13:17.306 --> 01:13:21.810
No, no, no, Timmy.
My fun has just begun.

01:13:21.936 --> 01:13:23.354
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

01:13:23.355 --> 01:13:26.023
I am your brother, why are
you doing this to me?

01:13:26.148 --> 01:13:30.778
<i>I think the better question is-would be,
what have you done to deserve this?</i>

01:13:30.903 --> 01:13:32.446
I don't know what you mean.

01:13:32.571 --> 01:13:35.199
Oh come, naughty old brother,
don't insult me.

01:13:35.241 --> 01:13:38.702
You can't think that I didn't know
about you and Georgette!

01:13:40.162 --> 01:13:41.455
Georgette?

01:13:44.041 --> 01:13:46.502
Look, Den...

01:13:46.627 --> 01:13:48.546
I didn't mean to hurt you.

01:13:48.629 --> 01:13:51.256
I'm afraid your penance
has come due, Timbo,

01:13:51.257 --> 01:13:53.509
it's time to account for your crimes.

01:13:54.134 --> 01:13:55.302
Den...

01:13:55.970 --> 01:13:58.597
– I'm... I'm so, so sorry.

01:13:58.639 --> 01:14:00.933
<i>- No no no, there's
no need to apologize.</i>

01:14:01.016 --> 01:14:03.519
<i>Your exile is more than enough reparation.</i>

01:14:03.644 --> 01:14:07.940
Oh, I do have my fingers crossed
for a scenario involving you,

01:14:07.982 --> 01:14:10.177
nurse Noakes and a broom handle.

01:14:10.296 --> 01:14:12.381
Cherry up, Timmy.
Bye bye now.

01:14:14.238 --> 01:14:15.739
He sends his love.

01:14:26.333 --> 01:14:29.086
I would like to ask about
the night of your arrest.

01:14:30.504 --> 01:14:34.592
I remember...
listening to his heart beat.

01:14:35.801 --> 01:14:39.179
Your heart beats much slower than ours.

01:14:40.264 --> 01:14:43.350
There is a gentleness to the sound.

01:14:43.475 --> 01:14:46.645
I find it... comforting.

01:14:49.398 --> 01:14:52.651
– Vyvyan, what time is it?
– I don't know. Who cares...

01:14:52.776 --> 01:14:55.863
I've heard a melody, boy.
For violin.

01:14:55.988 --> 01:14:57.281
Quick...

01:14:57.406 --> 01:14:59.241
Find-find a pen.

01:15:00.159 --> 01:15:04.830
I heard it in a dream.
I was in a nightmarish café...

01:15:04.955 --> 01:15:09.627
Blaring, bright lights,
but underground and no way out.

01:15:11.253 --> 01:15:15.716
And the waitresses...
they all had the same face.

01:15:15.841 --> 01:15:20.846
There was music playing, not like
any music I've ever heard in my life.

01:15:24.558 --> 01:15:29.021
It began...
It began...

01:15:29.146 --> 01:15:30.397
Wait...

01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:35.653
It was so clear a minute ago.

01:15:37.154 --> 01:15:40.491
Help me, Robert, help me.
It's slipping away!

01:15:42.826 --> 01:15:44.078
I've lost it.

01:15:45.871 --> 01:15:47.122
It'll come to you, sir.

01:15:47.915 --> 01:15:50.543
The minute you stop trying
to find it, it will find you.

01:15:50.668 --> 01:15:52.586
You are naive, Robert.

01:15:55.756 --> 01:15:57.591
I am anything but.

01:15:57.716 --> 01:16:00.553
There is a gulf between these chairs.

01:16:01.387 --> 01:16:03.764
What you want is no different
from what I want.

01:16:05.099 --> 01:16:07.184
The gulf is an illusion.

01:16:08.561 --> 01:16:11.480
<i>How do I describe that night, Sixsmith...</i>

01:16:11.605 --> 01:16:16.026
<i>What had happened between
Vyvyan and I transcended language.</i>

01:16:17.236 --> 01:16:21.323
<i>It was music that poured from his eyes,
and breathed from his lips.</i>

01:16:23.742 --> 01:16:27.121
<i>Music as beautiful as any
I have ever heard.</i>

01:16:33.210 --> 01:16:35.129
What-what are you doing in here?

01:16:39.341 --> 01:16:40.843
They found us.

01:17:08.162 --> 01:17:11.790
I'll be with you the whole way,
now focus on me.

01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:19.757
Stay with me.

01:17:20.257 --> 01:17:22.885
Right here.
I won't let you go.

01:17:41.362 --> 01:17:42.947
– Mr. Ewing.
– It-It's alright.

01:17:43.072 --> 01:17:45.824
I-I talked to the captain,
he'll hear your case.

01:17:45.950 --> 01:17:47.618
What's your name, boy?

01:17:48.410 --> 01:17:50.579
Autua, sir.

01:17:50.704 --> 01:17:53.916
This Christian gentleman,
who knows nothing about ships,

01:17:54.166 --> 01:17:57.336
tells me that you're a first-class sailor.

01:17:58.754 --> 01:18:02.132
Very well, let's see you'd
lower the main top, son.

01:18:08.055 --> 01:18:10.224
Mr. Roderick, my bottle is empty.

01:18:20.693 --> 01:18:23.320
Mr. Boerhaave, ready my piece.

01:18:23.737 --> 01:18:28.158
What? Sir, you...
gave me your word, Captain.

01:18:28.284 --> 01:18:30.411
P-Please, you can't do this.

01:18:30.536 --> 01:18:34.373
Nobody tells me what I can
and cannot do on my own ship.

01:18:34.498 --> 01:18:37.084
Specially when it concerns
nigger stow-away.

01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:06.696
Captain look!
He's got fish-hooks for toes.

01:19:06.697 --> 01:19:09.658
Boerhaave, you don't
make a mess of my deck.

01:19:44.777 --> 01:19:46.695
Captain, please...

01:19:49.740 --> 01:19:52.117
Look, if you can just hear me, I'm...

01:20:10.386 --> 01:20:13.222
The darkie's salt as I am.

01:20:15.349 --> 01:20:17.309
Mr. Boerhaave!

01:20:18.269 --> 01:20:20.853
It appears we have an
addition to our crew.

01:20:20.854 --> 01:20:22.481
Make sure he earns his keep.

01:20:24.942 --> 01:20:26.193
Mr. Hooks.

01:20:27.570 --> 01:20:32.116
I found her. She was in the chem labs,
looking for the bathroom.

01:20:32.992 --> 01:20:37.997
Ah? Well, perfect, then, uh, why don't
you take over from here, Sachs,

01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:40.666
you know, introduce our
little tribe, and uh...

01:20:40.749 --> 01:20:43.711
and guide Ms. Rey through the...
through the tower.

01:20:44.253 --> 01:20:47.423
The funny thing is, I am not
even supposed to be here.

01:20:47.548 --> 01:20:51.134
I was meant to be in Seoul,
but the air traffic controller strike

01:20:51.135 --> 01:20:54.721
put everything up, so now
I'm on the... time jumper tonight.

01:20:54.722 --> 01:20:58.017
Did you ever think that
the universe was against you?

01:20:58.142 --> 01:20:59.602
All the time.

01:21:00.769 --> 01:21:02.104
You mind?

01:21:02.479 --> 01:21:04.231
I'm cool.

01:21:17.244 --> 01:21:19.663
You seem nervous, Isaac.

01:21:19.788 --> 01:21:21.665
– Do I make you nervous?
– No.

01:21:23.375 --> 01:21:25.044
Actually, just the opposite.

01:21:43.938 --> 01:21:46.482
Will you gonna tell me
why you covered for me?

01:21:52.321 --> 01:21:57.284
<i>Freedom. The fatuous jingle
of our civilization.</i>

01:21:57.952 --> 01:22:02.581
<i>But only those deprived of it have
the barest inkling of what it really is.</i>

01:22:20.599 --> 01:22:24.979
There's much disagreement
on what should be done with you.

01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:28.607
The Corprocrats want you
euthanased as a deviant,

01:22:28.732 --> 01:22:31.527
the Manufacturer is
demanding a period of study,

01:22:31.569 --> 01:22:35.781
the Pyschogenomicists are screaming
for an immediate cerebral vivisection.

01:22:37.157 --> 01:22:42.788
However, the problem you
create is a political one.

01:22:45.291 --> 01:22:48.669
Which means you are my problem.

01:22:49.670 --> 01:22:54.466
I find it intriguing
to imagine that beneath this...

01:22:54.550 --> 01:23:00.598
perfectly engineered features, are thoughts
that terrify the whole of Unanimity.

01:23:05.269 --> 01:23:09.231
I'm not afraid of such thoughts,
because I do not fear the truth.

01:23:10.816 --> 01:23:15.029
There's a natural order
to this world, fabricant.

01:23:15.154 --> 01:23:19.700
And the truth is this order
must be protected.

01:23:31.795 --> 01:23:35.507
Inform the Archivist,
prepare for excisement.

01:23:35.633 --> 01:23:37.593
– Yes sir.
– Sir...

01:23:40.930 --> 01:23:43.891
Can you tell me what
happened to Hae-Ju Zheng?

01:23:44.266 --> 01:23:47.269
Killed, I was told.

01:24:08.958 --> 01:24:12.487
All this feast and excitements,
really Adam, it's...

01:24:12.502 --> 01:24:15.172
all too much, you'll need to rest.

01:24:29.103 --> 01:24:30.938
I had...

01:24:31.522 --> 01:24:37.278
a girlfriend once, she kept trying
to get me to read Carlos Castenada.

01:24:37.403 --> 01:24:40.155
– You ever read any o' that shit?
– Oh yeah.

01:24:42.575 --> 01:24:45.202
But the relationship was doomed.

01:24:45.327 --> 01:24:47.371
Every time she brought up a new...

01:24:47.413 --> 01:24:51.166
karma, past-life stuff,
I-I couldn't stop myself from laughing.

01:24:53.377 --> 01:24:54.420
And yet...

01:24:55.963 --> 01:24:58.632
I can't explain it...

01:24:58.757 --> 01:25:02.094
but I knew when I opened that door...

01:25:14.857 --> 01:25:18.068
They destroyed most of
the copies of the report.

01:25:20.237 --> 01:25:21.864
Most?

01:25:24.992 --> 01:25:27.703
There's no good choice here, is there?

01:25:27.828 --> 01:25:30.956
If I help you, I can lose my job...

01:25:31.081 --> 01:25:32.333
or worse,

01:25:34.376 --> 01:25:38.172
If I don't, a lot of people...

01:25:40.216 --> 01:25:42.426
Yeah, it will be worse than worse.

01:25:44.762 --> 01:25:47.264
You have to do...

01:25:47.389 --> 01:25:49.892
whatever you can't not do.

01:25:56.482 --> 01:25:58.817
Someone preyin' on you, Zachry?

01:25:59.902 --> 01:26:02.821
You really ain't feary about meetin'
Ol' Georgie on the summit?

01:26:02.947 --> 01:26:06.075
I'm more scaresome 'bout
the weather than in the Devil.

01:26:09.745 --> 01:26:11.455
You cog he's real?

01:26:12.164 --> 01:26:14.917
Who tripped the Fall,
if not Old Georgie?

01:26:17.002 --> 01:26:18.504
True-true?

01:26:22.508 --> 01:26:24.260
The Old Uns.

01:26:25.135 --> 01:26:27.221
That's just a rope o'smoke.

01:26:27.263 --> 01:26:29.848
Old Uns got the Smart.

01:26:30.599 --> 01:26:33.143
They mastered sick and seeds,

01:26:33.269 --> 01:26:35.604
they make miracles and fly across the sky.

01:26:35.646 --> 01:26:39.149
True. All true.
But they got somethin' else.

01:26:39.275 --> 01:26:43.612
A hunger in their hearts, a hunger
that's stronger than all their Smart.

01:26:44.989 --> 01:26:47.032
Hunger? For what?

01:26:48.826 --> 01:26:50.286
A hunger for more.

01:26:52.162 --> 01:26:55.583
<i>Belief like fear or love</i>

01:26:55.624 --> 01:27:00.462
<i>is a force to be understood as we
understand the theory of relativity,</i>

01:27:00.546 --> 01:27:02.882
and principles of uncertainty.

01:27:03.716 --> 01:27:07.428
<i>Phenomena that determine
the course of our lives.</i>

01:27:08.929 --> 01:27:13.225
<i>Yesterday, my life was
headed in one direction.</i>

01:27:16.437 --> 01:27:20.316
<i>Today, it is headed in another.</i>

01:27:20.774 --> 01:27:26.572
<i>Yesterday, I believed I would never
have done what I did today.</i>

01:27:26.697 --> 01:27:30.618
<i>These forces that often
remake time and space,</i>

01:27:30.743 --> 01:27:34.246
<i>they can shape and alter
who we imagine ourselves to be,</i>

01:27:34.371 --> 01:27:39.251
<i>begin long before we are born,
and continue after we perish.</i>

01:27:44.298 --> 01:27:47.426
<i>Our lives and our choices</i>

01:27:47.551 --> 01:27:52.932
<i>like quantum trajectories are
understood moment to moment</i>

01:27:53.390 --> 01:27:58.187
<i>at each point of intersection,
each encounter,</i>

01:27:58.312 --> 01:28:02.524
<i>suggest a new potential direction.</i>

01:28:04.944 --> 01:28:07.071
<i>Proposition:</i>

01:28:07.196 --> 01:28:10.449
<i>I have fallen in love with Luisa Rey.</i>

01:28:11.617 --> 01:28:17.540
<i>Is this possible?
I just met her, and yet...</i>

01:28:17.623 --> 01:28:23.629
<i>I feel like something important
has happened to me.</i>

01:28:33.973 --> 01:28:35.432
That's it.

01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:37.977
The music from my dream.

01:29:19.977 --> 01:29:24.607
This is from my dream,
that night I came to your room.

01:29:24.732 --> 01:29:29.403
This is the music I heard in my head,
somehow I gave it to you.

01:29:29.528 --> 01:29:32.197
I've been working on
this piece for weeks now.

01:29:32.323 --> 01:29:36.493
I suspect you heard it, and
incorporated it into your dream.

01:29:37.578 --> 01:29:40.122
I call it the Cloud Atlas Sextet.

01:29:44.168 --> 01:29:47.796
This is obviously the result
of our collaboration.

01:29:48.923 --> 01:29:51.759
The Atlas, I believe,

01:29:51.926 --> 01:29:55.012
is the only thing I've done
in my life that is of value.

01:29:56.847 --> 01:29:59.308
But I know I could not have written it,

01:30:00.643 --> 01:30:03.020
if I hadn't met you.

01:30:03.145 --> 01:30:06.815
There are whole movements in
the Atlas that I wrote imagining us,

01:30:06.941 --> 01:30:11.403
meeting again and again,
in different lives and different ages.

01:30:11.445 --> 01:30:12.571
Yes...

01:30:13.656 --> 01:30:20.579
Something as important as this
cannot be described as "yours" or "mine",

01:30:20.955 --> 01:30:22.915
it is "ours".

01:30:29.588 --> 01:30:31.799
That this is exactly how I feel, Vyvyan.

01:30:52.444 --> 01:30:53.946
I'm sorry, I...

01:30:54.989 --> 01:30:58.701
– I thought...
– You thought? You thought what?

01:30:58.826 --> 01:31:04.790
That I might fancy a little buggering
from a fine young dandy like yourself?

01:31:08.002 --> 01:31:09.837
I pack my bag, and be gone by morning.

01:31:09.879 --> 01:31:12.798
You'll do no such thing, you'll leave
only when I say you can leave.

01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:17.386
You will continue working
on Vyvyan Ayrs' Cloud Atlas.

01:31:17.511 --> 01:31:20.472
When it is finished, then I will
decide what to do with you.

01:31:20.514 --> 01:31:22.933
You can't keep me here!
I'm leaving!

01:31:23.058 --> 01:31:26.644
Good luck with your composing.
I'm sure a sterile old fuck like yourself

01:31:26.645 --> 01:31:29.523
is still capable of something
completely immemorable.

01:31:29.648 --> 01:31:34.320
I suggest you think about this, Robert.
Think about reputation.

01:31:35.529 --> 01:31:40.868
Reputation is everything in our society.
Yours, my disinherited reprobate,

01:31:40.993 --> 01:31:42.828
has expired.

01:31:42.953 --> 01:31:47.041
Did you not think that we would inquire
about someone living under our roof?

01:31:47.166 --> 01:31:50.211
Mackerras himself wrote, and I quote:

01:31:50.252 --> 01:31:54.924
"He is a prostitute whose liaisons
with perverts and sodomites

01:31:55.132 --> 01:31:59.887
were common place in his brief
and forgettable career at Caius.

01:32:00.012 --> 01:32:04.308
Lock up the silverware."
Unquote.

01:32:06.644 --> 01:32:10.022
Be warned.
Leave here without my consent,

01:32:10.231 --> 01:32:15.945
and all the musical society will know
of the degenerate Robert Frobisher.

01:32:17.154 --> 01:32:19.114
After that,

01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:23.911
even if you compose one of the
greatest symphonies ever written,

01:32:24.119 --> 01:32:26.247
no one will hear it,

01:32:26.747 --> 01:32:30.459
because no one will want
anything to do with you.

01:33:10.207 --> 01:33:12.167
I won't let you go again.

01:33:18.090 --> 01:33:20.676
I told you he'd come.

01:33:21.218 --> 01:33:22.970
<i>Two things became clear.</i>

01:33:23.095 --> 01:33:27.057
<i>Hanging myself from Edinburgh's flagpole
is preferable to letting that parasite</i>

01:33:27.099 --> 01:33:28.893
<i>plunder my talent a day longer.</i>

01:33:29.184 --> 01:33:31.437
<i>I must complete my sextet.</i>

01:33:31.478 --> 01:33:34.356
<i>I can't do it here,
so tonight I plan to make my escape.</i>

01:33:47.119 --> 01:33:49.622
<i>Please stand by for vehicle scan.</i>

01:33:51.749 --> 01:33:54.001
<i>Clearance granted.</i>

01:34:12.978 --> 01:34:15.898
Any jailbreak's a risky proposition.

01:34:16.023 --> 01:34:20.611
One little cock-up, and we are
dangling at her majesty's pleasure.

01:34:20.736 --> 01:34:22.821
I know, I know.

01:34:22.905 --> 01:34:24.907
We could use code names,

01:34:24.990 --> 01:34:28.160
but the truth is I'd probably
be the first to forget mine.

01:34:28.369 --> 01:34:31.372
So, Mr. Cavendish...

01:34:31.956 --> 01:34:33.832
Ernie Blancksmith.

01:34:33.958 --> 01:34:39.004
This is Mr. Meeks
and my girl Veronica Costello.

01:34:39.838 --> 01:34:42.716
– To trust.
– To trust.

01:34:43.717 --> 01:34:46.804
I know, I know.

01:34:47.972 --> 01:34:50.391
What about the parrot, then?

01:34:50.516 --> 01:34:52.309
If ever that was a likely songbird.

01:34:52.434 --> 01:34:57.106
Mr. Meeks is a fine and honorable
gentleman, he would never betray us.

01:34:57.231 --> 01:35:00.442
Besides, no one's ever heard
him say anything else.

01:35:00.568 --> 01:35:02.653
I know, I know.

01:35:02.778 --> 01:35:05.322
Question is, old man,

01:35:05.406 --> 01:35:07.449
think you're up to snuff?

01:35:22.548 --> 01:35:24.425
<i>Unanimity requires compliance.</i>

01:35:24.426 --> 01:35:27.720
<i>We have a security code Red,
prepare to be boarded.</i>

01:35:27.845 --> 01:35:29.805
What are you going to do?

01:35:29.930 --> 01:35:32.057
Stay calm, stay calm.

01:35:33.142 --> 01:35:36.812
<i>" It will end in tears."
You've warned me.</i>

01:35:36.937 --> 01:35:39.106
<i>I suppose I'm as hopeless
as Adam Ewing,</i>

01:35:39.231 --> 01:35:42.358
<i>oblivious towards the unspeakable
forms lying and waiting,</i>

01:35:42.359 --> 01:35:44.778
<i>blind to the fact his friend
is poisoning him.</i>

01:35:44.820 --> 01:35:46.488
Wait, please...

01:35:46.530 --> 01:35:49.116
The idea of losing this ring
distresses me beyond measure.

01:35:49.241 --> 01:35:50.534
Don't be a silly puff here, Adam,

01:35:50.576 --> 01:35:54.288
I'm sure your wife will set
your health above a golden loop.

01:35:54.622 --> 01:35:59.168
I have seen the onset for dropsy
and it is not a pretty sight!

01:36:00.961 --> 01:36:04.297
I know an excellent Spanish goldsmith,
who works with such alacrity,

01:36:04.298 --> 01:36:07.426
that your Tilda may not have
to know this was ever removed.

01:36:08.969 --> 01:36:12.723
– Give it to me!
– Get your fucking hands off my pudding!

01:36:12.765 --> 01:36:15.684
It's not your pudding, you
Alzheimer riddled lout!

01:36:15.809 --> 01:36:17.269
You've already eaten...

01:36:24.443 --> 01:36:26.320
Better get in here.

01:36:46.715 --> 01:36:48.467
Mr. Cavendish!

01:36:57.601 --> 01:37:00.854
<i>The room stank of bitter medicine.</i>

01:37:07.111 --> 01:37:10.029
<i>Curiously heavy things, guns.</i>

01:37:10.030 --> 01:37:12.825
Why did I take it, exactly?

01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:15.077
<i>Can't say.</i>

01:37:15.202 --> 01:37:16.620
<i>An intuition.</i>

01:37:16.745 --> 01:37:18.914
<i>A sense of significance.</i>

01:37:19.707 --> 01:37:21.750
<i>That from this point on...</i>

01:37:23.252 --> 01:37:25.045
<i>there was no going back.</i>

01:37:43.105 --> 01:37:46.734
Just seein' them clouds,
we run out o' time.

01:37:51.447 --> 01:37:56.327
– Don't need no smart rope.
– Yeah, see you fall,

01:37:57.077 --> 01:37:58.954
I'll catch you.

01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:17.431
Hands in the air. Now!
Move it, step off of the vehicle!

01:38:17.473 --> 01:38:20.893
Get down.
Down, now!

01:38:24.563 --> 01:38:26.774
Fuckin' migrant monkey-talk.

01:38:27.274 --> 01:38:29.902
Why do they hire these greasy stubs?

01:38:30.986 --> 01:38:32.780
Negative, sir.
Definite illegal.

01:38:32.905 --> 01:38:34.198
You turn him from now.

01:38:34.865 --> 01:38:36.200
I'm reading a second life form!

01:38:36.201 --> 01:38:37.868
– Where?
– In the truck.

01:38:37.993 --> 01:38:40.204
– Check it out.
– Yes, sir.

01:39:11.902 --> 01:39:16.282
You troddin' on the Devil's ground now,

01:39:16.407 --> 01:39:17.783
Valleysman.

01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:26.500
I'm sayin' just once.
That off-lander ain't gettin' to the top.

01:39:27.710 --> 01:39:31.672
Time for you to let go that rope.

01:39:31.797 --> 01:39:33.465
You trespass...

01:39:34.091 --> 01:39:35.759
You pay the price.

01:39:37.511 --> 01:39:40.097
Now drop that rope.

01:39:40.222 --> 01:39:43.684
Drop that rope.

01:39:45.436 --> 01:39:48.272
– Forcecom 1, entering the truck.
– Roger that.

01:39:48.522 --> 01:39:50.399
I turn in visual.

01:39:51.984 --> 01:39:54.236
– It's her!
– It'll be okay, uh?

01:40:11.295 --> 01:40:13.464
Fire at me.
Fire at me!

01:40:30.314 --> 01:40:31.774
Who are you?

01:40:32.316 --> 01:40:33.817
Commander Hae-Ju Zheng.

01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:38.072
First science officer
of the Union rebellion.

01:40:38.197 --> 01:40:40.741
Why are you doing this?

01:40:41.325 --> 01:40:44.620
Because I believe you have
the power to change this world.

01:40:45.037 --> 01:40:49.959
<i>Drop that rope...
Let go that rope.</i>

01:40:50.084 --> 01:40:52.878
<i>"Hands are bleedin', can't let go"</i>

01:40:53.629 --> 01:40:57.007
Hands are bleedin'.
Can't let go.

01:41:10.854 --> 01:41:12.356
Thank you Zachry.

01:41:14.024 --> 01:41:15.859
You savin' me twice, ain't ya?

01:41:17.027 --> 01:41:18.904
You fall, I catch you.

01:42:01.989 --> 01:42:04.283
<i>Excessive force confirmed.</i>

01:42:07.244 --> 01:42:08.662
<i>Stop them.
Stop them now.</i>

01:42:23.093 --> 01:42:26.805
What are you doing, boy?
I thought I made myself clear.

01:42:26.931 --> 01:42:31.268
– Do what you want. I'm leaving!
– Fine, Frobisher...

01:42:31.393 --> 01:42:33.938
Go, but I take this.

01:42:34.772 --> 01:42:36.232
– Give that to me.
– It's mine!

01:42:36.315 --> 01:42:37.316
I'm warning you!

01:42:37.441 --> 01:42:39.610
Under the conditions of this relationship,

01:42:39.652 --> 01:42:42.238
I'm certain that I'm in my legal rights.

01:42:43.197 --> 01:42:47.201
Give it to me. Give it to me, or I swear
to God I will kill you as you stand!

01:42:48.953 --> 01:42:52.122
Please... you're a coward.

01:42:52.164 --> 01:42:55.251
– I'll do it.
– You won't pull that trigger.

01:42:57.378 --> 01:42:59.797
Your kind never does.

01:43:19.733 --> 01:43:24.154
PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ADAM EWING

01:43:41.297 --> 01:43:44.008
Yes. Yes, well...

01:43:44.049 --> 01:43:47.553
How-how fares our worm today, Adam?

01:43:48.679 --> 01:43:51.265
I- I'm afraid it has taken the best of me.

01:43:51.348 --> 01:43:53.976
Oh no no no. Nonsense.
Nonsense.

01:43:54.059 --> 01:43:57.813
You mustn't give up.
You must think of your beautiful wife.

01:43:58.063 --> 01:44:00.733
You must think of Tilda.

01:44:21.545 --> 01:44:23.547
They're trapped in the downway.
We've got them.

01:44:35.684 --> 01:44:37.269
What are you doing?

01:45:36.245 --> 01:45:39.081
<i>Nay, the dead never stay dead.</i>

01:45:43.168 --> 01:45:47.756
<i>Open your ears, and
they'll never stop a yibberin'.</i>

01:46:02.354 --> 01:46:04.356
What is this place?

01:46:05.274 --> 01:46:07.818
Before the Fall,

01:46:07.943 --> 01:46:11.071
Old Uns built dwellings,

01:46:11.113 --> 01:46:14.742
beyond the sky, among the stars,

01:46:16.076 --> 01:46:20.289
this place joined here with there.

01:46:29.778 --> 01:46:31.398
Sonmi.

01:46:37.431 --> 01:46:38.933
It is she.

01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:42.770
The Old Uns pray to Sonmi
same as Valleysmen?

01:46:43.938 --> 01:46:48.025
Nay... not 'zactly same.

01:47:12.216 --> 01:47:15.553
Stay close.
Fabricants get snatched here.

01:47:17.763 --> 01:47:19.890
– All clear.
– Thank you.

01:47:19.932 --> 01:47:23.394
No sweat, we're partners.
But you got to tell me what's happening.

01:47:23.519 --> 01:47:25.646
Okay, let me take off these clothes,
call the cops,

01:47:25.647 --> 01:47:28.273
and I promise I tell you everything
that happen in the morning.

01:47:28.274 --> 01:47:30.776
Okay. But I hope you
realize you just said exactly

01:47:30.818 --> 01:47:32.987
what every character in
any decent mystery says

01:47:33.153 --> 01:47:34.822
right before they get killed.

01:47:34.947 --> 01:47:36.574
Good night, Javier.

01:48:19.783 --> 01:48:22.076
What'd you mean down there?
'bout...

01:48:22.077 --> 01:48:27.416
The Old Uns and Valleymen prayin'
to Sonmi not 'zactly the same?

01:48:29.335 --> 01:48:32.379
Old men... they were different.

01:48:34.215 --> 01:48:35.966
Different?

01:48:36.091 --> 01:48:37.509
How?

01:48:40.346 --> 01:48:42.473
You want the True-true?

01:48:55.027 --> 01:48:57.154
This is where you live?

01:48:57.279 --> 01:49:00.241
This... is where Union was born.

01:49:08.499 --> 01:49:10.668
Sonmi were no God.

01:49:10.834 --> 01:49:16.423
She died hundreds of years ago
on a faraway peninsula, deadlanded now.

01:49:17.049 --> 01:49:18.050
What?

01:49:18.884 --> 01:49:20.302
I cog Valleysmens beliefs,

01:49:20.344 --> 01:49:22.805
I know Abbess teach you
Sonmi was a miracle,

01:49:22.888 --> 01:49:27.268
birthed o' Darwin god o' Smart,
but ain't the True-true.

01:49:27.977 --> 01:49:33.107
Her life was sad n' judased, she died
tryin' to change the Old-Uns thinkin'.

01:49:33.232 --> 01:49:38.779
<i>Liiiies... nothing but lying.</i>

01:49:38.862 --> 01:49:41.282
Nay, nay you-you're lying.

01:49:52.835 --> 01:49:55.832
The nature of our immortal
lives is in the...

01:49:55.880 --> 01:49:57.464
Sonmi?

01:49:58.215 --> 01:50:01.385
Before she died, she spoke
of her acts n' deedins'.

01:50:01.594 --> 01:50:05.222
Her words are heart savin' blessin',
remindin' me what's the True-true.

01:50:05.347 --> 01:50:09.143
How long you lissin' to this?!
How long you jus' stand there,

01:50:09.226 --> 01:50:14.940
n' let a stranger keep fuggin'
your beliefs up n' down, in n' out!

01:50:15.399 --> 01:50:18.360
<i>Our lives are not our own,</i>

01:50:18.611 --> 01:50:22.531
<i>from womb to tomb,
we're bound to others.</i>

01:50:24.143 --> 01:50:25.263
Zachry.

01:50:26.577 --> 01:50:27.995
You alright?

01:50:29.246 --> 01:50:30.581
Finish your saysoe...

01:50:38.881 --> 01:50:41.258
If I wanted to kill you, you'd be dead.

01:50:42.218 --> 01:50:45.679
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I just want to talk.

01:50:46.180 --> 01:50:48.390
Be cool.
Alright.

01:50:51.769 --> 01:50:54.647
And if I wanted to kill you,
you'd be dead already.

01:50:54.772 --> 01:50:58.776
How's it feel, uh?
Good conversation start, isn't it?

01:51:01.403 --> 01:51:04.573
You are Lester Rey's daughter,
that's for goddamn sure.

01:51:05.115 --> 01:51:08.327
– You knew my father?
– Korean War.

01:51:09.036 --> 01:51:10.955
I was in the two-one.

01:51:12.498 --> 01:51:15.417
That's me on the end, next to your dad.

01:51:15.793 --> 01:51:18.587
Mortar landed so close
it could have dropped out of my ass.

01:51:18.712 --> 01:51:22.675
If your father hadn't done what he did,
I wouldn't be here.

01:51:27.846 --> 01:51:29.765
Guess that makes two of us.

01:51:39.567 --> 01:51:47.241
You ain't let go that rope cause you' a
lustin' for that darkly, sweet'meat.

01:51:47.366 --> 01:51:49.285
I cog it all, now.

01:51:49.326 --> 01:51:55.416
This whore, with her cokeynut
skin, and her slywise mask,

01:51:55.624 --> 01:51:59.503
smilin' n' wormin' her way into
your trust so you brin' her here,

01:51:59.628 --> 01:52:03.549
scavin' n' sivvin' for what?

01:52:03.632 --> 01:52:06.093
For what, fool?

01:52:06.260 --> 01:52:11.307
They want the island.
The Prescients want it all.

01:52:11.348 --> 01:52:16.979
You judasin' your kin for a piece of ass.

01:52:17.271 --> 01:52:19.732
She ain't your tribe, she
ain't even your color,

01:52:19.773 --> 01:52:22.693
she just 'bout ignorin'
all your yarns n' ways,

01:52:22.902 --> 01:52:27.823
spinnin' n' spoutin' her whoahsomse lies,
and you lap it up, like a dog in heat!

01:52:28.032 --> 01:52:31.076
– That ain't truth.
– Ain't it? Then do sumthin', stop her!

01:52:31.118 --> 01:52:35.706
Take your spiker an' slit her throat!

01:52:35.998 --> 01:52:39.542
Protect your tribe,
protect your sister, little Caktin,

01:52:39.543 --> 01:52:42.463
kill her now, before it's too late!

01:52:47.051 --> 01:52:48.469
They will kill you.

01:52:49.178 --> 01:52:51.847
– You don't know these people like I do.
– Yeah?

01:52:52.264 --> 01:52:54.892
Well if that's all you came to tell me,

01:52:54.975 --> 01:52:56.602
you're a little bit late.

01:52:56.685 --> 01:53:00.022
Somebody just forced me off
the Swannekke bridge.

01:53:03.776 --> 01:53:06.153
This is out of control.

01:53:07.029 --> 01:53:08.364
Do you know who did it?

01:53:08.489 --> 01:53:11.242
The contractor calls himself Bill Smoke.

01:53:11.367 --> 01:53:13.702
– And...
– What?

01:53:15.454 --> 01:53:16.956
He got Sachs.

01:53:17.581 --> 01:53:18.582
Isaac?

01:53:18.666 --> 01:53:20.167
A bomb on his plane.

01:53:22.127 --> 01:53:24.255
The press is blaming the PLO.

01:53:25.965 --> 01:53:31.011
He was a treat.
Like Sixsmith, like... you.

01:53:39.186 --> 01:53:40.688
Bring them thru.

01:53:51.574 --> 01:53:55.411
Sonmi 451,
I'm most honored to meet you.

01:53:55.703 --> 01:53:59.540
I am General An-Cor Apis,
leader of Union.

01:54:01.125 --> 01:54:02.751
Who is paying them?

01:54:03.210 --> 01:54:05.045
The same guy that pays me.

01:54:05.754 --> 01:54:07.423
Lloyd Hooks?

01:54:07.673 --> 01:54:09.884
Hughes & Pikes Consulting.

01:54:10.718 --> 01:54:12.636
I've heard of them.

01:54:12.720 --> 01:54:16.181
They're, uh... lobbiers for oil companies.

01:54:18.350 --> 01:54:25.524
Why would big oil... hire
Lloyd Hooks to run a nuclear reactor?

01:54:28.152 --> 01:54:33.157
You get that same look your father
used to get. You see I told you.

01:54:33.782 --> 01:54:35.951
Hooks doesn't want the report discovered,

01:54:35.993 --> 01:54:38.287
because he doesn't want the reactor fixed.

01:54:38.537 --> 01:54:40.414
He wants it to fail.

01:54:40.456 --> 01:54:43.167
This is about the future
of energy in this country.

01:54:43.918 --> 01:54:47.838
They want the explosion.
The chaos and carnage.

01:54:47.963 --> 01:54:50.633
The more deaths, the better.

01:55:02.394 --> 01:55:05.606
Can't cog o' thing,
words n'worrins' like a wasp's nest,

01:55:05.648 --> 01:55:07.233
proke'd n'prod'd by you.

01:55:07.274 --> 01:55:11.237
You come elbowin' in' our life,
yibberin' about the True-true,

01:55:11.278 --> 01:55:13.280
and never tellin' the whole true.

01:55:13.614 --> 01:55:15.491
I need to cog what you doin'!

01:55:15.866 --> 01:55:19.370
I told you.
I come to send a plea o' help.

01:55:19.495 --> 01:55:21.371
Help, why?

01:55:21.372 --> 01:55:23.916
To steal our land?
To kill n' slave us all?!

01:55:23.958 --> 01:55:25.376
What d'you want?!

01:55:35.469 --> 01:55:39.139
Prescients' dyin', Zach.
Just like Catkin.

01:55:39.598 --> 01:55:42.601
This world poison me n' all my kin'.

01:55:43.143 --> 01:55:46.480
We get no help,
ain't no home if I don' find a way.

01:55:46.605 --> 01:55:50.150
I say the truesome.
We not survive.

01:55:51.569 --> 01:55:53.279
We not survive...

01:55:56.991 --> 01:55:59.034
<i>Ayrs has the dogs after me.</i>

01:56:00.077 --> 01:56:03.080
<i>The bullet passed through,
killing little more than his appetite,</i>

01:56:03.163 --> 01:56:06.959
<i>and he's out for blood.
I'll have to pay the piper.</i>

01:56:08.043 --> 01:56:10.880
– I should call the cops.
– It won't help.

01:56:11.839 --> 01:56:14.258
How do I know you're not lying to me?

01:56:14.383 --> 01:56:17.970
Smoke will be coming for me,
as soon as he figures out I'm with you.

01:56:18.095 --> 01:56:20.389
We need that report.

01:56:20.514 --> 01:56:22.766
I can't protect you for long without it.

01:56:24.351 --> 01:56:27.438
– General Apis...
– You, my dear...

01:56:27.479 --> 01:56:30.816
are proof... our efforts were not in vain.

01:56:30.858 --> 01:56:33.819
But... I'm just a dinery server.

01:56:33.944 --> 01:56:37.114
I was not genomed to alter reality.

01:56:37.197 --> 01:56:39.575
No revolutionary ever was.

01:56:44.288 --> 01:56:46.332
I'm sorry.

01:56:46.457 --> 01:56:49.126
I cannot do what you're asking.

01:56:52.463 --> 01:56:55.883
It would be a difficult choice for anyone.

01:56:57.843 --> 01:57:01.680
But, before you call your decision final,

01:57:01.722 --> 01:57:04.725
there is one last thing
I would like you to see,

01:57:04.934 --> 01:57:08.771
in order to fully understand
what we are fighting for.

01:57:29.500 --> 01:57:31.752
Cross your fingers n' toes.

01:58:20.634 --> 01:58:22.720
If your pray' be answered,

01:58:23.721 --> 01:58:26.640
nay Prescients never
return to the Valley again?

01:58:30.519 --> 01:58:34.857
Those wishin' to come with us,
they're welcome.

01:58:37.401 --> 01:58:39.194
The Valley is my home.

01:59:26.867 --> 01:59:28.619
Are you alright?

01:59:29.370 --> 01:59:32.831
I know... it is forbidden.

02:00:03.988 --> 02:00:08.951
<i>Sixsmith. I climb the steps of
the Scot monument every morning.</i>

02:00:09.034 --> 02:00:10.828
<i>And all becomes clear.</i>

02:00:11.704 --> 02:00:14.248
<i>Wish I could make you
see this brigthness.</i>

02:00:15.332 --> 02:00:18.544
<i>Don't worry, all is well.</i>

02:00:18.669 --> 02:00:22.089
<i>All is so perfectly, damnably well.</i>

02:00:23.883 --> 02:00:30.764
<i>I understand now, that boundaries
between noise and sound are conventions.</i>

02:00:33.851 --> 02:00:39.273
<i>All boundaries are conventions,
waiting to be transcended.</i>

02:00:41.775 --> 02:00:43.944
<i>One may trandcend any convention,</i>

02:00:44.153 --> 02:00:47.239
<i>if only one can first
conceive of doing so.</i>

02:00:53.245 --> 02:00:58.626
<i>Moments like this, I can feel your heart
beating as clearly as I feel my own,</i>

02:00:59.752 --> 02:01:02.838
<i>and I know that separation is an illusion.</i>

02:01:09.511 --> 02:01:13.599
<i>My life extends far beyond
the limitations of me.</i>

02:01:31.534 --> 02:01:35.287
Storm is coming, Mr. Ewing.
Gonna get you down below.

02:01:37.498 --> 02:01:41.877
I'm not running a fuckin' charity,
out with you! Off you go!!

02:01:42.878 --> 02:01:47.091
Aah, Mr. Ewing!
A-a-a word if you may.

02:01:47.925 --> 02:01:53.097
Dangerous times we have here.
About that scandal. They say that

02:01:53.222 --> 02:01:57.309
ruffian Robert Frobisher is a composer.

02:01:58.227 --> 02:02:02.606
You're a composer too,
aren't you Mr. Ewing?

02:02:02.731 --> 02:02:06.527
– What d'you want?
– The constable asked to search my rooms.

02:02:06.652 --> 02:02:08.737
I know how hard... you're working,

02:02:08.779 --> 02:02:12.032
so I told him there's
no one on the third floor.

02:02:12.533 --> 02:02:17.538
It costs quite a bit of money
to keep an entire floor empty.

02:02:27.381 --> 02:02:29.300
– That's all I have.
– Hmm...

02:02:34.263 --> 02:02:37.558
What a beautiful... waistcoat.

02:02:39.602 --> 02:02:41.520
If these letters are important,

02:02:41.645 --> 02:02:44.064
– why d'you keep reading them?
– I don't know.

02:02:44.815 --> 02:02:48.319
Maybe I'm... just trying
to understand something.

02:02:49.737 --> 02:02:50.696
What?

02:02:51.822 --> 02:02:57.328
Why we keep making the
same mistakes, over and over.

02:02:57.995 --> 02:03:01.165
Maybe you should ask... Megan.

02:03:01.957 --> 02:03:04.418
– What?
– Do you know a Megan?

02:03:04.543 --> 02:03:07.421
That's his niece.
How do you know that?

02:03:09.632 --> 02:03:11.467
Looks like he mailed something to her.

02:03:11.926 --> 02:03:15.554
Probably used the envelope
he was keeping letters in.

02:03:17.556 --> 02:03:20.351
Come on, Luisa.
First rule of mystery writing:

02:03:20.434 --> 02:03:23.187
a good clue always leads to another clue.

02:03:23.729 --> 02:03:28.692
When the ghostly ordeal of Timothy
Cavendish is turned into a film,

02:03:28.817 --> 02:03:33.948
I'm thinking for the role of the hero,
one patch of Laurence Olivier

02:03:34.073 --> 02:03:35.866
with a dash of Michael Caine.

02:03:36.742 --> 02:03:38.118
Who the hell is this?

02:03:38.244 --> 02:03:41.079
<i>The Doctor Conway of Aurora House,
I'm covering for Dr. Upward.</i>

02:03:41.080 --> 02:03:44.249
– Ooh, is this about mother?
– Yes, it is, Mr. Hotchkiss,

02:03:44.250 --> 02:03:45.834
I-I'm afraid you must deal yourself,

02:03:45.876 --> 02:03:47.878
I don't think that she's
gonna last the night.

02:03:48.420 --> 02:03:50.798
<i>Unfortunately, it is an
unconvenient time for us,</i>

02:03:50.839 --> 02:03:53.008
do we really need to come right now?

02:03:53.425 --> 02:03:57.137
No no, of course not, but she
did ask for you specifically,

02:03:57.429 --> 02:04:00.224
and she seems quite upset
about her last will.

02:04:04.019 --> 02:04:05.187
I'll be right there.

02:04:15.781 --> 02:04:18.951
<i>The plan was a series of topling dominoes,</i>

02:04:18.993 --> 02:04:22.913
<i>that had commenced with Ernie
announcing my death to nurse Noakes.</i>

02:04:23.455 --> 02:04:25.626
– I know, I know.
– Shhh!

02:04:26.041 --> 02:04:30.838
<i>The entire ambush hinged upon
the silence of Mr. Meeks.</i>

02:04:31.046 --> 02:04:33.009
– I know, I know.
– Shh!

02:04:37.970 --> 02:04:39.847
Mr. Cavendish?

02:04:41.056 --> 02:04:42.516
Everything alright?

02:04:46.103 --> 02:04:48.105
– Don't leave me here.
– Shh.

02:05:03.078 --> 02:05:04.830
Mr. Cavendish?

02:05:10.294 --> 02:05:13.380
– I knew it was too good to be true!
– You temp-temperous witch!

02:05:13.964 --> 02:05:18.302
Mr. Hotchkiss, your mother is my
dearest friend here. Do please hurry.

02:05:22.431 --> 02:05:24.683
And so... adieu!

02:05:24.808 --> 02:05:30.147
Which, translated literally from the
French, means: "To command before...

02:05:30.272 --> 02:05:31.440
God"!

02:05:38.197 --> 02:05:41.992
<i>I have Joe Napier on Line 1,
Mr. Hooks. He said it can't wait.</i>

02:05:43.994 --> 02:05:46.539
For God sake, Joe,
I am late already. What's up?

02:05:46.664 --> 02:05:51.001
<i>I got a call from that reporter. Rey...</i>

02:05:51.126 --> 02:05:53.420
She was asking about Sixsmith.

02:05:53.504 --> 02:05:54.421
<i>I see.</i>

02:05:54.547 --> 02:05:56.465
You said she wasn't gonna be a problem.

02:05:58.509 --> 02:06:01.929
Well, some problems are
more resilient than others, Joe.

02:06:04.431 --> 02:06:07.685
– Where's the ruddy key?
– He didn't leave it in the ignition!

02:06:07.810 --> 02:06:09.769
His wife was driving, she took it,

02:06:09.770 --> 02:06:12.356
the ruddy female took
the key in with her!

02:06:12.481 --> 02:06:15.234
Oh Sweet Saint Ruddy Jude,
what do we do now?

02:06:15.359 --> 02:06:17.111
Look under the sunpad.

02:06:21.740 --> 02:06:23.075
What is it?

02:06:23.200 --> 02:06:24.783
It's not a key, what'd you do with it?

02:06:24.784 --> 02:06:26.912
– What else could it be?
– Well, how does it work?

02:06:29.665 --> 02:06:31.166
– Shite!
– Oh no!

02:06:31.458 --> 02:06:33.335
Well, think of something,
you're the genius,

02:06:33.336 --> 02:06:35.546
you're the bloody ruddy genius!

02:06:37.715 --> 02:06:39.008
We're done for.

02:06:47.266 --> 02:06:51.353
Oh right... I can't even believe
I'm going to do this.

02:06:52.354 --> 02:06:55.024
<i>Is this thing working?
I mean is it still on, can you hear me?</i>

02:06:55.149 --> 02:06:56.692
Just keep walking.

02:07:04.033 --> 02:07:05.451
I think he's behind me.

02:07:06.285 --> 02:07:08.579
Whatever you do, don't look back.

02:07:12.291 --> 02:07:13.876
Get out of my car!

02:07:22.301 --> 02:07:24.136
Press that button thru!

02:07:37.107 --> 02:07:40.486
Oh no, it's Mr. Meeks,
he doesn't want to come.

02:07:44.114 --> 02:07:46.283
Ruddy bloody hell!

02:07:48.327 --> 02:07:50.496
All for one and one for all?

02:08:05.803 --> 02:08:07.179
The gate!

02:08:08.889 --> 02:08:11.809
Veronica, would you unlock
the door for Mr. Meeks.

02:08:13.561 --> 02:08:17.022
Hello Mr. Meeks,
we're off for a lifetime trife.

02:08:17.147 --> 02:08:19.149
I know, I know.

02:08:24.071 --> 02:08:27.700
– Rev in speed!
– Ho, how fondling!

02:08:30.786 --> 02:08:31.318
Oh, no!

02:08:31.319 --> 02:08:33.372
Go for it, cavendish!
– Here we go!

02:08:49.263 --> 02:08:50.931
Here we go.

02:09:23.505 --> 02:09:26.884
Come on, Adam, we haven't all day.
You really need to drink this.

02:09:27.009 --> 02:09:29.386
The worm fights back,

02:09:29.428 --> 02:09:32.514
it is always darkest before the dawn.

02:09:32.556 --> 02:09:34.016
Mr. Ewing?

02:09:34.934 --> 02:09:38.186
Mr. Ewing is at a critical
juncture in his treatment.

02:09:38.187 --> 02:09:41.482
The next few hours will
determine if he lives or die.

02:09:41.607 --> 02:09:43.275
Then I stay here.

02:09:43.400 --> 02:09:47.696
– No, no, no you can't.
– I must. Mr. Ewing saved my life.

02:09:48.030 --> 02:09:49.406
It my duty.

02:09:51.992 --> 02:09:55.037
Listen to me, you ignorant ape,

02:09:55.162 --> 02:09:56.914
Mr. Ewing doesn't want you around him,

02:09:56.956 --> 02:09:58.791
you probably infected him to begin with.

02:09:59.250 --> 02:10:03.128
He begged me, and I quote:
"Keep that dirty nigger away from me!"

02:10:03.254 --> 02:10:06.298
So please kindly respect his wishes!

02:10:37.705 --> 02:10:39.373
– Where'd he go?
– I don't know.

02:10:43.794 --> 02:10:45.004
Shit!

02:11:03.188 --> 02:11:04.732
To freedom.

02:11:29.548 --> 02:11:36.013
You are going to be sorry
in ways you cannot even imagine.

02:12:24.979 --> 02:12:27.106
– No immigrants here, no immigrants here.
– Look,

02:12:27.147 --> 02:12:29.775
I'm not an inspector.
We need your help...

02:12:32.194 --> 02:12:33.277
I don't understand.

02:12:33.278 --> 02:12:35.070
[IN PERFECT SPANISH]
We don't want the police to get involved,

02:12:35.071 --> 02:12:36.907
but there is a man trying to kill me

02:12:36.908 --> 02:12:39.326
and we really need your help.

02:12:44.623 --> 02:12:48.711
Are there no true Scotsmen in the house?

02:12:50.045 --> 02:12:54.091
Those there English gerrrrunts

02:12:54.133 --> 02:12:58.721
are trampling all over
my God-given rrights!

02:12:59.597 --> 02:13:02.057
These people are mine.

02:13:06.186 --> 02:13:11.317
They've used me an' my pals most direly,

02:13:11.442 --> 02:13:15.738
and we're in need
of a wee pit of assistance!

02:13:15.863 --> 02:13:17.406
Right, pal...

02:13:20.159 --> 02:13:21.827
We'll not gonna let ye down.

02:13:21.952 --> 02:13:24.079
Now you just look here, you grebo,

02:13:24.121 --> 02:13:26.832
you can go shag your bloody sporran...

02:14:01.367 --> 02:14:03.744
They two people came in here,
which way did they go?

02:14:07.373 --> 02:14:09.500
Which way they go?!

02:14:11.877 --> 02:14:13.045
Shut up!

02:14:14.338 --> 02:14:15.965
Shut the fuck up!

02:14:21.220 --> 02:14:23.013
Stupid fucking wetback.

02:14:27.851 --> 02:14:29.478
What-what's that, Ewing?

02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:34.275
How shall I comprehend
when you drool and dribble so?

02:14:34.358 --> 02:14:36.902
Oh, let me hazard a guess,
something in the key of

02:14:36.944 --> 02:14:39.863
"Oh Henry, how could you do this to me?

02:14:40.155 --> 02:14:44.201
I thought we were friends?"
Oh, unfortunately, you're wrong.

02:14:44.410 --> 02:14:48.622
Wrong like Horrox and
your silly father-in-law.

02:14:48.747 --> 02:14:54.002
There is only one rule that binds
all people, one governing principle

02:14:54.003 --> 02:14:56.672
that defines every relationship
on God's green earth.

02:14:57.381 --> 02:15:02.011
"The Weak are Meat
and the Strong Do Eat."

02:15:36.128 --> 02:15:37.129
That way.

02:15:42.593 --> 02:15:46.013
I told Hooks you couldn't be trusted, Joe.

02:15:46.055 --> 02:15:48.390
You'll be next, you silver bitch.

02:15:48.515 --> 02:15:50.434
Part of the business.

02:15:51.268 --> 02:15:53.520
Enjoy your retirement.

02:15:59.151 --> 02:16:02.696
Amaba... a este... perro!

02:16:06.492 --> 02:16:09.078
And don't call me a fucking wetback.

02:16:13.666 --> 02:16:15.668
"Why?" you ask.

02:16:15.751 --> 02:16:21.257
It's absurdly simple,
there is gold in your trunk, I want it.

02:16:21.423 --> 02:16:23.842
so I've killed you for it.

02:16:32.977 --> 02:16:35.353
Get off Mr. Ewing or you know I kill you!

02:16:38.941 --> 02:16:41.026
Mr. Ewing, Mr. Ewing!

02:16:41.151 --> 02:16:44.321
Gotta flush you out.
Com'on, Mr. Ewing.

02:17:45.090 --> 02:17:46.799
What was that?

02:17:46.799 --> 02:17:49.136
Kona war-cry.

02:17:49.553 --> 02:17:50.721
Zachry!

02:17:56.268 --> 02:17:57.686
Oh no no, Sonmi, no.

02:17:58.520 --> 02:17:59.688
Zachry!

02:18:06.779 --> 02:18:09.740
This is what the general wanted me to see?

02:18:20.876 --> 02:18:25.589
<i>The end rushes towards me.
Unable to eat or sleep.</i>

02:18:25.714 --> 02:18:30.093
<i>Like Ewing, the "mortal coil"
has become a noose.</i>

02:18:33.931 --> 02:18:36.433
<i>I'd rather become music.</i>

02:18:45.817 --> 02:18:49.237
They believe they're going to Exultation.

02:18:49.655 --> 02:18:52.532
But they are not, are they?

02:19:06.046 --> 02:19:08.465
Welcome to Exultation.

02:19:09.674 --> 02:19:11.135
Take a seat.

02:19:14.888 --> 02:19:16.849
Just relax.

02:19:17.892 --> 02:19:20.686
This is to remove your collar.

02:21:38.991 --> 02:21:42.995
<i>"Enemy's sleepin', don't slit that throat"</i>

02:22:27.540 --> 02:22:32.503
The genomics industry demands a huge
quantity of biomatter for wombtanks.

02:22:32.628 --> 02:22:35.923
and more importantly to sustain
their engineered labor force.

02:22:37.091 --> 02:22:40.553
Recycled Fabricants are
a cheap source of protein.

02:22:41.804 --> 02:22:43.389
Soap.

02:22:45.891 --> 02:22:49.144
They feed us to ourselves.

02:23:00.239 --> 02:23:01.657
That ship...

02:23:04.743 --> 02:23:07.454
The ship must be destroyed.

02:23:09.456 --> 02:23:10.666
Yes.

02:23:10.791 --> 02:23:15.337
The systems that built them
must be turned down.

02:23:16.797 --> 02:23:17.840
Yes.

02:23:19.091 --> 02:23:25.389
No matter if we're born in a tank
or a womb, we are all Pureblood.

02:23:27.892 --> 02:23:28.684
Yes.

02:23:31.270 --> 02:23:36.817
We must all fight...
and if necessary, die

02:23:37.693 --> 02:23:41.822
to teach people the truth.

02:23:49.955 --> 02:23:52.499
This is what we have been waiting for.

02:23:59.298 --> 02:24:00.799
<i>It's done.</i>

02:25:21.922 --> 02:25:25.885
You were then taken to
a Union control satellite link.

02:25:26.760 --> 02:25:32.975
I broadcast my Revelation to the
twelve States and four Off-World colonies.

02:25:33.642 --> 02:25:38.355
18 minutes later,
the Enforcers attacked.

02:25:39.899 --> 02:25:42.610
<i>To be is to be perceived.</i>

02:25:43.235 --> 02:25:48.699
And so to know thyself is only possible
through the eyes of the other.

02:25:51.619 --> 02:25:54.037
<i>The nature of our immortal lives</i>

02:25:54.038 --> 02:25:58.000
is in the consequences
of our words and deeds,

02:25:58.918 --> 02:26:03.339
that go on and are pushing
themseves throughout all time.

02:26:45.839 --> 02:26:47.716
Hide.

02:27:14.743 --> 02:27:18.080
From good chief, now you're meat.

02:28:20.392 --> 02:28:23.270
– Catkin...
– Uncle Zach.

02:28:30.402 --> 02:28:31.737
Thanks, Zachry.

02:28:32.446 --> 02:28:34.990
No, thank you.

02:28:44.375 --> 02:28:48.170
Com'on, Mr. Ewing.
One more.

02:28:48.671 --> 02:28:52.841
One more.
Salt clean out your stomach.

02:28:56.136 --> 02:28:59.890
Close.
Com'on Mr. Ewing, com'on!

02:29:03.852 --> 02:29:08.190
Do you see where we are, Mr. Ewing?

02:29:10.150 --> 02:29:11.151
Home.

02:29:18.200 --> 02:29:20.202
Megan Sixsmith?

02:29:30.629 --> 02:29:32.089
Make them pay.

02:29:36.635 --> 02:29:38.679
You can count on it.

02:29:48.063 --> 02:29:49.189
Thank you.

02:29:53.193 --> 02:29:55.279
My uncle was a scientist,

02:29:55.404 --> 02:29:58.949
but... he believed that love was real.

02:30:00.201 --> 02:30:04.121
A kind of... natural phenomenon.

02:30:06.665 --> 02:30:11.629
He believed that love could outlive death.

02:30:15.049 --> 02:30:19.011
<i>I finished it in a frenzy that reminded me
of our last night in Cambridge.</i>

02:30:20.387 --> 02:30:24.642
<i>Watched my final sunrise,
enjoyed the last cigarette.</i>

02:30:25.142 --> 02:30:27.644
<i>Didn't think the view
could be anymore perfect,</i>

02:30:27.645 --> 02:30:30.022
until I saw that beat-up trilby.

02:30:31.899 --> 02:30:35.986
<i>Honestly, Sixsmith, as
ridiculous as that thing makes you look,</i>

02:30:36.111 --> 02:30:39.365
<i>I don't believe I've ever seen
anything more beautiful.</i>

02:30:45.746 --> 02:30:48.290
<i>Watched you for as long as I dared.</i>

02:30:50.459 --> 02:30:55.130
<i>I don't believe it was a fluke
that I saw you first.</i>

02:30:58.242 --> 02:30:59.494
– Okay.
– Thank you.

02:31:04.890 --> 02:31:07.268
Captain saysoed he take you with us.

02:31:07.393 --> 02:31:10.729
– I wanna go with Meronym.
– Go... Go where?

02:31:11.730 --> 02:31:16.235
Prescients in the same boat as all us.
Got no home neitherwise.

02:31:18.112 --> 02:31:21.282
Nay, not yet.

02:31:23.075 --> 02:31:28.581
You think someone will gonna hear
your prayer, come down from the sky?

02:31:28.956 --> 02:31:30.499
Perhaps...

02:31:30.624 --> 02:31:32.585
Perhaps one day.

02:31:32.710 --> 02:31:35.087
One day ain't but a flea o' hope.

02:31:35.629 --> 02:31:38.007
Yay, and fleas ain't so easy to rid.

02:31:52.062 --> 02:31:55.441
<i>I believe there is another
world waiting for us, Sixsmith.</i>

02:31:55.566 --> 02:31:57.484
<i>A better world.</i>

02:31:57.985 --> 02:32:00.195
<i>And I'll be waiting for you there.</i>

02:32:02.656 --> 02:32:03.866
May I help you, sir?

02:32:03.867 --> 02:32:07.119
Yes, thank you. I-I'm looking for
a friend who came to Edinburg...

02:32:14.126 --> 02:32:16.712
<i>I believe we do not stay dead long.</i>

02:32:18.589 --> 02:32:22.134
<i>Find me beneath the Corsican
stars where we first kissed.</i>

02:32:23.594 --> 02:32:27.389
<i>Yours eternally.
R.F.</i>

02:33:36.792 --> 02:33:40.921
The report said commander Zheng
was killed in the assault.

02:33:41.630 --> 02:33:43.215
That is correct.

02:33:44.800 --> 02:33:46.844
But you say that you loved him?

02:33:48.554 --> 02:33:50.139
Yes I do.

02:33:51.432 --> 02:33:54.727
You mean you are still in love with him?

02:33:55.311 --> 02:33:57.980
I mean that I will always be.

02:34:01.191 --> 02:34:04.486
Our lives are not our own.

02:34:05.654 --> 02:34:10.492
From womb to tomb,
we're bound to others.

02:34:13.412 --> 02:34:16.040
Past and present.

02:34:23.923 --> 02:34:27.676
And by each crime and every kindness,

02:34:29.303 --> 02:34:32.223
we birth our future.

02:34:56.205 --> 02:35:00.041
In your Revelation, you spoke of
the consequences of an undividual's life

02:35:00.042 --> 02:35:03.420
replicated throughout eternity.

02:35:06.090 --> 02:35:09.176
Does this mean that
you believe in an afterlife?

02:35:10.302 --> 02:35:12.388
No heaven or hell?

02:35:15.224 --> 02:35:19.353
I believe death is only a door.

02:35:21.188 --> 02:35:25.234
When its closes, another opens.

02:35:26.819 --> 02:35:29.488
If I'd care to imagine heaven,

02:35:30.114 --> 02:35:32.741
I would imagine a door open.

02:35:34.410 --> 02:35:36.537
And behind it,

02:35:37.788 --> 02:35:41.917
I will find him there, waiting for me.

02:35:52.678 --> 02:35:54.138
My love.

02:35:58.642 --> 02:36:01.312
Oh God, I missed you so much.

02:36:08.110 --> 02:36:09.528
Thank you, sir.

02:36:11.655 --> 02:36:14.491
If I may ask one last question...

02:36:14.950 --> 02:36:18.454
You had to know this Union
scheme was doomed to fail.

02:36:18.579 --> 02:36:19.580
Yes.

02:36:19.872 --> 02:36:22.249
And why did you agree to it?

02:36:22.499 --> 02:36:26.462
This is what general Apis asked of me.

02:36:26.587 --> 02:36:28.672
What, to be executed?

02:36:29.089 --> 02:36:33.801
If I had remained invisible,
the truth would stay hidden.

02:36:33.802 --> 02:36:35.846
I couldn't allow that.

02:36:38.349 --> 02:36:42.186
And what if no one believes this truth?

02:36:44.813 --> 02:36:46.815
Someone already does.

02:37:06.544 --> 02:37:08.295
Adam, good God...

02:37:08.420 --> 02:37:12.049
I have just been recounting
your astonishing adventure.

02:37:12.174 --> 02:37:14.759
Please, join us.
Give him a chair.

02:37:14.760 --> 02:37:16.262
No no, thank you.

02:37:16.387 --> 02:37:18.389
I cannot stay.

02:37:18.472 --> 02:37:22.101
What are you doing here? Has not the
doctor said at least three weeks in bed?

02:37:22.268 --> 02:37:24.937
He did, but this couldn't wait.

02:37:26.105 --> 02:37:28.106
I need to speak with you, sir.
Privately.

02:37:28.107 --> 02:37:30.150
Of course.

02:37:38.701 --> 02:37:41.745
Is that the contract
from Reverend Horrox?

02:37:42.955 --> 02:37:46.458
– It is indeed.
– Well, you know I could have sent a boy.

02:37:51.922 --> 02:37:54.091
Are you insane?!

02:37:54.466 --> 02:37:58.512
I owe my life to a self-freed slave.

02:37:59.471 --> 02:38:03.976
And I cannot in good conscience participate
in this kind of business any longer.

02:38:06.687 --> 02:38:08.856
This would make such a good book.

02:38:08.981 --> 02:38:10.608
I'll drink to that.

02:38:20.409 --> 02:38:26.916
<i>Outside, fat snow flakes are falling
on slate roofs and granite walls.</i>

02:38:27.041 --> 02:38:32.630
<i>Like Solzhenitsyn laboring in Vermont,
I shall beaver away in exile.</i>

02:38:32.713 --> 02:38:36.967
<i>Unlike Solzhenitsyn, I shan't be alone.</i>

02:38:48.771 --> 02:38:54.068
Goddamn you, sir, if you were
not my daughter's husband...

02:38:54.193 --> 02:38:55.736
Hello, Father.

02:38:56.403 --> 02:38:57.571
Tilda?

02:39:00.407 --> 02:39:01.783
What's going on?

02:39:01.784 --> 02:39:04.245
I've come to say goodbye.

02:39:04.370 --> 02:39:06.872
Goodbye?
Where are you going?

02:39:06.997 --> 02:39:10.709
We're moving back East,
to work with the abolitionists.

02:39:10.834 --> 02:39:12.336
What?

02:39:13.295 --> 02:39:17.633
That poison has rotted your brain.

02:39:17.675 --> 02:39:20.302
Oh if it has, I highly recommend it.

02:39:20.511 --> 02:39:22.638
I've not felt this good in years.

02:39:22.763 --> 02:39:26.850
Tilda, I forbid you from going
anywhere with this mad man.

02:39:26.976 --> 02:39:30.104
I've been afraid of you
my whole life, Father.

02:39:32.940 --> 02:39:35.276
I'm going with my husband.

02:39:40.322 --> 02:39:41.240
Adam.

02:39:45.286 --> 02:39:47.079
Listen to me...

02:39:47.580 --> 02:39:51.292
For the sake of my grandson,
if not your own...

02:39:51.417 --> 02:39:54.544
there is a natural order to this world,

02:39:54.545 --> 02:39:58.257
and those who try to upend it
do not fare well.

02:39:59.884 --> 02:40:02.803
This movement will never survive.

02:40:03.429 --> 02:40:07.975
If you join them, you and
your entire family will be shunned.

02:40:08.100 --> 02:40:12.688
At best, you exist as pariah,
to be spat on and beaten.

02:40:13.230 --> 02:40:16.775
At worst, lynched or crucified.

02:40:34.418 --> 02:40:36.337
And for what?

02:40:37.880 --> 02:40:39.340
For what?

02:40:39.465 --> 02:40:42.675
No matter what you do, it will
never amount to anything more

02:40:42.676 --> 02:40:46.388
than a single drop in a limitless ocean.

02:40:47.556 --> 02:40:51.060
What is an ocean but a multitude of drops?

02:41:04.490 --> 02:41:06.408
Fire is dyin'.

02:41:07.785 --> 02:41:10.913
Just as well, my yawnin' is done.

02:41:10.938 --> 02:41:12.938
No, please Gran'Pi, Please!

02:41:14.959 --> 02:41:18.420
Come on, come here, you little buggars!
Com'on, it's getting cold!

02:41:18.504 --> 02:41:21.716
No, you heard your Gran'mi,
com'on, get on with you.

02:41:33.435 --> 02:41:36.397
You like it down here, don't you Gran'pi?

02:41:37.064 --> 02:41:41.026
Supposin'... reminds me of my Valley.

02:41:41.151 --> 02:41:42.903
Which is Earth?

02:41:45.990 --> 02:41:49.034
That in there, that blue shimmerin'.

02:41:54.290 --> 02:41:56.542
Now, help your Gran'pi up.

02:42:00.671 --> 02:42:04.429
You gonna tell us about the
roguesome ship, and the big split,

02:42:04.430 --> 02:42:05.718
and all the next-next?

02:42:05.843 --> 02:42:09.430
Oh, your Gran'mi tells the next-next
way better than me.

02:42:11.348 --> 02:42:13.642
D'you still love Gran'mi?

02:42:15.895 --> 02:42:20.649
Your Gran'mi is the best thin'
that ever happened to me.

02:42:26.822 --> 02:42:28.991
Come on, you Gran'pi.

02:42:29.116 --> 02:42:32.036
Let me warm that li'le ol' bone.

02:42:50.548 --> 02:42:58.548
