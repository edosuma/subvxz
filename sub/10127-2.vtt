ONCE AGAIN.

I'M SHOOTING
A DOCUMENTARY
FOR FEENY'S FILM CLASS.

BE YOURSELVES.

OF 3 NEW ROOMMATES.

02:24.500 --> 02:25.967
YEAH, LONG TIME.

02:25.967 --> 02:27.133
THE REAL REASON
I MOVED IN HERE

02:27.133 --> 02:29.600
WAS BECAUSE MY DAD THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE A GOOD CHANCE

02:29.600 --> 02:32.233
FOR ME TO GET TO KNOW
MY HALF-BROTHER JACK.

08:52.467 --> 08:54.600
I'M SORRY
I BOTHERED YOU AT ALL.

08:54.600 --> 08:57.000
HAVE A NICE DATE, OK?

08:58.033 --> 09:00.133
CORY?

09:00.133 --> 09:03.867
SHAWN AND I
ARE NOT GETTING OFF
TO A GOOD START.

09:03.867 --> 09:06.500
I REALLY DON'T KNOW
WHY IT ISN'T WORKING.

09:06.500 --> 09:09.300
MAYBE
THIS WHOLE THING
WAS A MISTAKE.

09:09.300 --> 09:10.767
IT'S BEEN
TOO MANY YEARS.

09:10.767 --> 09:12.000
WHAT WAS
MY DAD THINKING?

09:12.000 --> 09:13.767
HE PUTS US
IN AN APARTMENT
TOGETHER,

09:13.767 --> 09:15.800
AND WE'RE SUDDENLY
SUPPOSED TO BE
BROTHERS?

09:15.800 --> 09:17.000
WHAT MAKES US
BROTHERS?

09:17.000 --> 09:19.100
CORY'S
MORE MY BROTHER.

09:19.100 --> 09:21.900
GUY'S FIRST TIME
AWAY FROM HOME

09:21.900 --> 09:24.834
ABOUT TO DO LAUNDRY
UNSUPERVISED.

09:24.834 --> 09:27.767
HELLO. DO YOU KNOW
WHERE YOUR STORY IS?

09:27.767 --> 09:30.800
NO, NO, NOT IN
THE HOT WATER.
IT'LL SHRINK!

09:30.800 --> 09:32.700
OH. I SHOULD
BE THERE

09:32.700 --> 09:34.400
TO TALK HIM
THROUGH THIS.

09:34.400 --> 09:37.000
HE'S AN IDIOT.
CUT THE CORD.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.033
GUYS, THIS IS ERIC.

09:39.033 --> 09:40.967
HIS REAL NAME
IS LARRY.

09:40.967 --> 09:43.133
HE'S MY BEST FRIEND
BARBIE'S BROTHER.

09:43.133 --> 09:44.600
BUT AROUND US,
HE'S ERIC.

09:44.600 --> 09:45.600
HI, MOM, DADDY.

09:45.600 --> 09:47.467
WHAT'S GOING ON,
PLEASE?

09:47.467 --> 09:49.100
WE ALL MISS ERIC SO MUCH,

09:49.100 --> 09:50.900
I HIRED LARRY TO BE ERIC.

09:50.900 --> 09:51.900
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

09:51.900 --> 09:54.700
DOES HE PLAY BASKETBALL?

09:54.700 --> 09:56.934
HI, MOM, DADDY.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.600
WHO ARE YOU?

10:02.600 --> 10:03.600
ERIC.

10:03.600 --> 10:05.367
WHO ARE YOU?

10:05.367 --> 10:06.767
ERIC.

10:06.767 --> 10:07.867
WELCOME.

10:07.867 --> 10:10.000
HEY, I'M GOING TO NEED
SOME MORE CLOTHES.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.400
NO KIDDING.

10:11.400 --> 10:12.400
OH, CORY, QUESTION.

10:12.400 --> 10:14.767
YOU KNOW SHAWN
BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE.

10:14.767 --> 10:15.800
WHAT IS WRONG WITH HIM?

10:15.800 --> 10:17.500
WHY CAN'T HE GET ALONG
WITH JACK?

10:17.500 --> 10:18.500
I'LL TALK TO HIM.

10:18.500 --> 10:19.767
YOU BETTER GET OVER THERE

10:19.767 --> 10:21.233
'CAUSE THEY'RE GOING
TO KILL EACH OTHER.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.667
AND ALL THROUGH MY LIFE
EVERYONE'S ALWAYS ASKED ME,

10:30.667 --> 10:33.600
"WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO BE WHEN YOU GROW UP,
YOUNG WHIPPERSNAPPER?"

10:33.600 --> 10:34.600
WHO TALKS LIKE THAT?

10:34.600 --> 10:35.700
CRAZY PEOPLE.

10:35.700 --> 10:37.367
AND THE POINT IS
IT WAS A LOT OF
PRESSURE.

10:37.367 --> 10:39.600
AND NOW THAT
I'VE FOUND SOMETHING
THAT I'M GOOD AT,

10:39.600 --> 10:40.834
IT'S LIKE
THE PRESSURE'S OFF.

10:40.834 --> 10:42.100
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST
PUT DOWN YOUR CAMERA

10:42.100 --> 10:43.667
AND REALIZE THAT
YOUR FRIEND IS IN TROUBLE?

10:43.667 --> 10:45.500
PRESSURE, PRESSURE
FROM A GIRLFRIEND.

10:45.500 --> 10:46.900
I THOUGHT
I WAS DOING YOU
A FAVOR.

10:46.900 --> 10:47.900
I DON'T NEED
YOUR CHARITY.

10:47.900 --> 10:48.900
Jack: IT'S NOT CHARITY.

10:48.900 --> 10:50.500
I FELT BAD FOR YOU

10:50.500 --> 10:52.600
BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T AFFORD
THOSE CONCERT TICKETS,
SO I BOUGHT THEM.

10:52.600 --> 10:55.700
I DON'T WANT
ANYTHING YOU BOUGHT WITH
YOUR FATHER'S MONEY, OK?

10:55.700 --> 10:56.700
FOR YOUR
INFORMATION,

10:56.700 --> 10:58.100
I WORK
EVERY SUMMER
FOR MY MONEY.

10:58.100 --> 11:00.100
I'M NOT SOME SPOILED
LITTLE RICH KID, OK?

11:00.100 --> 11:01.200
I PAY FOR SCHOOL
WITH STUDENT LOANS.

11:01.200 --> 11:03.400
AND WHAT HAVE YOU
AGAINST MY FATHER,
SHAWN?

11:03.400 --> 11:04.967
NOTHING.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HIM.

11:04.967 --> 11:07.233
WHAT DO YOU HAVE
AGAINST YOUR REAL FATHER?

11:07.233 --> 11:09.367
SHAWN, MY FATHER
IS THE ONE
WHO RAISED ME.

11:09.367 --> 11:11.800
I CAN'T JUST HAVE
FEELINGS FOR SOMEONE
I DON'T KNOW.

11:13.233 --> 11:14.900
YEAH?

11:14.900 --> 11:16.667
WELL, NEITHER CAN I.

11:16.667 --> 11:20.133
YOU CAN FIND YOURSELF
ANOTHER ROOMMATE.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.300
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU HIDE
BEHIND THAT CAMERA
AND DISAPPEAR?

11:29.300 --> 11:32.934
THAT MUST NOT BE A VERY GOOD
LENS IF YOU CANNOT SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

11:32.934 --> 11:35.500
TOPANGA, LISTEN,
I UNDERSTAND WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING, OK?

11:35.500 --> 11:36.867
BUT WHAT
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND

11:36.867 --> 11:37.867
IS THAT
THE ASSIGNMENT

11:37.867 --> 11:39.100
IS TO MAKE
A DOCUMENTARY.

11:39.100 --> 11:42.867
I'M LIKE THE GUY
MAKING A NATURE FILM
IN AFRICA,

11:42.867 --> 11:46.300
AND WHEN THAT ANTELOPE
IS ABOUT TO GET EATEN
BY THE LION,

11:46.300 --> 11:48.700
THE GUY
BEHIND THE CAMERA
DOESN'T STOP THE LION.

11:48.700 --> 11:51.800
HE FILMS IT AND LETS
NATURE TAKE ITS COURSE.

11:51.800 --> 11:54.767
AND AS A FILMMAKER,
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

11:54.767 --> 11:56.100
BUT AS A FRIEND,

11:56.100 --> 11:59.934
WELL, THEN I GUESS
WE'LL HAVE TO LET
NATURE TAKE ITS--

11:59.934 --> 12:01.133
NATURE
TAKE ITS WHAT?

12:01.133 --> 12:02.600
THAT'S HOW YOU
END A SENTENCE?

12:02.600 --> 12:05.700
WHERE DO YOU
COME UP
WITH THESE?

12:06.800 --> 12:08.734
MORGAN, I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU MISS ERIC,

12:08.734 --> 12:12.367
BUT YOU
CAN'T REPLACE HIM BY
HIRING THIS YOUNG MAN.

12:12.367 --> 12:13.867
I'M NOT TRYING
TO REPLACE HIM.

12:13.867 --> 12:16.500
I JUST WANT TO MISS
MY REAL BROTHER LESS.

12:16.500 --> 12:19.467
YOUR PARENTS CAN'T
POSSIBLY APPROVE OF THIS.

12:19.467 --> 12:20.467
YEAH, THEY DO.

12:20.467 --> 12:23.200
MY DAD EVEN PLAYS
BASKETBALL WITH HIM.

12:24.367 --> 12:26.600
NOW I WANT YOU
TO GIVE HIM SOME ADVICE,

12:26.600 --> 12:28.600
LIKE YOU ALWAYS GAVE ERIC.

12:29.667 --> 12:33.133
RUN, MAN.
RUN LIKE THE WIND.

12:35.500 --> 12:37.200
HEY, CORY.

12:41.100 --> 12:45.000
THOSE JUNIPERS ARE COMING IN
QUITE NICELY THIS YEAR,
HUH, MR. FEENY?

12:45.000 --> 12:47.200
DON'T MOCK MY GARDEN.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.200
I KNOW YOU TOO WELL,
MR. MATTHEWS.

12:49.200 --> 12:51.934
IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM,
JUST COME OUT WITH IT.

12:51.934 --> 12:53.867
DID YOU MEAN IT
WHEN YOU SAID

12:53.867 --> 12:55.834
I COULD BE
AN EXCELLENT FILMMAKER?

12:55.834 --> 12:59.100
I THINK YOUR PROJECT
SHOWS GREAT POTENTIAL.

12:59.100 --> 13:00.600
YEAH. YEAH, IT DOES.

13:00.600 --> 13:03.400
I MEAN, IT'S GOT PASSION,
IT'S GOT CONFLICT,

13:03.400 --> 13:05.967
EVERYTHING THAT MAKES
A FILM GREAT, RIGHT?

13:05.967 --> 13:07.767
MM-HMM. LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE ON TRACK.

13:07.767 --> 13:09.133
YEAH. THE PROBLEM
IS TOPANGA.

13:09.133 --> 13:11.667
SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
THAT THE GUY BEHIND THE CAMERA

13:11.667 --> 13:16.100
HAS TO STAY BEHIND THE CAMERA
AND NOT GET EMOTIONALLY
INVOLVED,

13:16.100 --> 13:20.467
EVEN THOUGH THIS MEANS
THAT SHAWN AND HIS NEW BROTHER

13:20.467 --> 13:21.900
MAY NOT BE GETTING ALONG.

13:23.300 --> 13:24.900
I SEE.

13:24.900 --> 13:26.934
WELL, MR. MATTHEWS,

13:26.934 --> 13:28.500
I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY

13:28.500 --> 13:30.734
THAT NO MATTER
HOW YOUR FILM TURNS OUT,

13:30.734 --> 13:35.934
YOU HAVE THE POTENTIAL
OF BEING A SENSITIVE
AND CARING FILMMAKER

13:35.934 --> 13:37.400
IF YOU SO CHOOSE.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.667
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

13:39.667 --> 13:42.934
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU TO BE
A SENSITIVE AND CARING
YOUNG PERSON.

13:42.934 --> 13:44.900
AND I'LL BE VERY
INTERESTED IN SEEING

13:44.900 --> 13:47.600
HOW YOUR STORY
TURNS OUT.

13:47.600 --> 13:49.600
FILM.

13:49.600 --> 13:50.934
YES.

13:50.934 --> 13:52.500
FILM.

14:00.934 --> 14:04.667
[MUSIC PLAYING]

14:11.867 --> 14:13.133
HEY, JACK.

14:13.133 --> 14:16.934
GOT SOME LOVELIES
HERE FROM 3-B
WHO JUST WANNA DANCE.

14:16.934 --> 14:18.467
DANCE, JACK.

14:18.467 --> 14:19.500
I'M DANCING.

14:19.500 --> 14:21.300
YOU DON'T SEEM TO BE
ENJOYING YOURSELF.

14:21.300 --> 14:23.734
OH, HE IS
ENJOYING HIMSELF,
LET ME TELL YOU.

14:23.734 --> 14:25.300
THIS WILD MAN HERE
IS THE KIND OF GUY

14:25.300 --> 14:27.400
WHO LIKES TO DANCE
ON THE INSIDE.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.033
DANCE ON
THE OUTSIDE, JACK.

14:29.033 --> 14:31.367
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE WE SHOULD
CALL IT A NIGHT.

14:31.367 --> 14:33.400
OH, NO.
NO, NO, NO. NO.

14:33.400 --> 14:36.500
NO, THE DAY ERIC MATTHEWS
CALLS IT A NIGHT AT 7:00

14:36.500 --> 14:38.000
IS THE DAY
HE LEAVES THE BUSINESS.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.400
YOU LOOK
REALLY DEPRESSED.

14:40.400 --> 14:43.600
SHOULD I DO
A COMEDIC MONOLOGUE?

14:43.600 --> 14:44.834
TOMORROW!

14:44.834 --> 14:46.800
TONIGHT YOU SLEEP,
TOMORROW YOU DO
THE MONOLOGUE.

14:46.800 --> 14:49.600
I TELL YOU, WE
WANT TO BE WELL-RESTED
FOR THAT MONOLOGUE, TOO.

14:49.600 --> 14:52.734
HEY, WE'RE AT
THE DOOR NOW, OK?
BYE-BYE THEN.

14:54.133 --> 14:57.400
YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE
REASON I WANTED SHAWN
TO MOVE IN HERE

14:57.400 --> 14:58.734
WAS SO I COULD
GET TO KNOW HIM.

14:58.734 --> 14:59.800
AND HE WON'T LET ME.

14:59.800 --> 15:01.000
I REACH OUT,
HE RESENTS ME.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.700
I TRY TO BE
HONEST WITH HIM,
HE RUNS OUT.

15:02.700 --> 15:04.900
THIS BROTHER THING
ISN'T GOING TO WORK,
MAN.

15:04.900 --> 15:06.800
EH, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.700
WHY DON'T YOU JUST,
YOU KNOW, WALK AWAY?

15:08.700 --> 15:10.767
THEN YOU WON'T BE
BROTHERS ANYMORE,
RIGHT?

15:10.767 --> 15:12.700
YEAH, I MEAN, WE DON'T
EVEN KNOW EACH OTHER.

15:12.700 --> 15:15.000
WHAT MAKES US BROTHERS
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

15:15.000 --> 15:17.100
OK.

15:17.100 --> 15:18.100
WHEN I WAS 12,

15:18.100 --> 15:19.800
CORY AND I WENT
TO A PHILLIES GAME.

15:19.800 --> 15:22.367
MY FATHER GAVE ME
JUST ENOUGH MONEY
FOR 2 HOT DOGS,

15:22.367 --> 15:24.400
SO, YOU KNOW, I WENT
AND I BOUGHT 2 HOT DOGS.

15:24.400 --> 15:28.100
OF COURSE
I REALIZED BY THE TIME
I GOT BACK TO CORY,

15:28.100 --> 15:29.700
I ATE 'EM BOTH.

15:29.700 --> 15:31.967
CORY CRIED. HA HA.

15:31.967 --> 15:34.300
THIS IS VERY SAD.

15:34.300 --> 15:36.100
THAT WAS
THE HAPPY PART.

15:36.100 --> 15:37.100
YOU WANT SAD?

15:37.100 --> 15:38.667
I WENT UP AND DOWN
THE AISLE

15:38.667 --> 15:40.367
TRYING TO COLLECT
MONEY FROM PEOPLE.

15:40.367 --> 15:42.834
I GOT A DIME HERE,
A QUARTER THERE.

15:42.834 --> 15:45.400
AND I WENT AND
I BOUGHT CORY A HOT DOG.

15:45.400 --> 15:47.700
MAN, HE WAS SO HAPPY.
HE SMILED.

15:47.700 --> 15:49.900
AND THEN I SMILED
'CAUSE I FELT GOOD.

15:49.900 --> 15:51.300
YOU KNOW,
I DID THE RIGHT THING.

15:51.300 --> 15:53.400
I WAS A GOOD
OLDER BROTHER.

15:54.500 --> 15:55.767
HE STARTED GIGGLING,

15:55.767 --> 15:58.400
REACHED HIS LITTLE
HAND OUT FOR THAT
HOT DOG AND...

15:58.400 --> 16:01.000
TOOK A FOUL BALL
RIGHT SMACK-DAB
IN THE HEAD.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.400
POW! KNOCKED HIM
UNCONSCIOUS.

16:03.400 --> 16:05.934
CORY DOESN'T
GIGGLE ANYMORE.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.400
NEXT TO WENDY'S
UNICORN MONOLOGUE,

16:08.400 --> 16:11.300
THAT'S THE WORST STORY
I'VE EVER HEARD.

16:11.300 --> 16:12.934
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

16:12.934 --> 16:15.133
THAT IS
A REALLY BAD STORY.

16:15.133 --> 16:16.667
SO...

16:16.667 --> 16:19.700
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME ONE
ABOUT<i>YOUR </i>BROTHER?

16:32.133 --> 16:34.834
HEY. LOOK WHO'S HERE.

16:34.834 --> 16:36.700
THE DOCUMENTARY MAN.

16:36.700 --> 16:39.734
SOUTH PHILLY,
MAKING MOVIES.

16:39.734 --> 16:42.600
YEAH, I...FIGURED
YOU'D BE HERE.

16:44.200 --> 16:47.300
GOSH, I HAVEN'T BEEN
HERE SINCE YOU MOVED
TO THE TRAILER PARK.

16:47.300 --> 16:48.834
YEAH.

16:48.834 --> 16:51.600
YOU KNOW,
JACK LIVED HERE, TOO.

16:51.600 --> 16:54.867
ALTHOUGH I'M SURE
HE'S FORGOTTEN.

16:56.100 --> 16:59.200
SO WHY DON'T YOU...
START ROLLING THAT THING,

16:59.200 --> 17:00.467
AND WE'LL FINISH
YOUR MOVIE.

17:00.467 --> 17:03.200
NO. NO, I'M NOT
HERE FOR THAT.

17:03.200 --> 17:05.400
THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT
ANYMORE.

17:05.400 --> 17:06.600
IT IS TO ME.

17:06.600 --> 17:10.200
I'VE GOT SOMETHING
TO SAY. TURN IT ON.

17:15.934 --> 17:20.834
I WAS 7 WHEN
MY DAD FIRST TOLD ME
THAT I HAD A BROTHER.

17:21.900 --> 17:24.734
YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS
WANTED A BROTHER.

17:24.734 --> 17:26.100
I WONDERED...

17:26.100 --> 17:28.100
WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE,

17:28.100 --> 17:29.133
IF HE'D LIKE ME,

17:29.133 --> 17:31.734
IF HE EVEN
KNEW ABOUT ME.

17:31.734 --> 17:33.767
WHEN I WAS 10,
I FINALLY GOT THE COURAGE

17:33.767 --> 17:37.667
TO WRITE JACK A LETTER
TELLING HIM ALL ABOUT ME.

17:37.667 --> 17:40.400
I DIDN'T GET AN ANSWER.

17:40.400 --> 17:41.900
BUT I KEPT WRITING TO HIM

17:41.900 --> 17:44.600
BECAUSE HE WAS MY BROTHER.

17:44.600 --> 17:47.233
BUT I MUST HAVE SENT HIM,
LIKE, 15 LETTERS,

17:47.233 --> 17:48.867
AND I NEVER GOT
A SINGLE THING BACK.

17:48.867 --> 17:54.100
SO I KNEW THAT
HE DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH ME,

17:54.100 --> 17:55.600
AND HE STILL DOESN'T.

17:55.600 --> 17:58.100
Jack: I NEVER
GOT ANY LETTERS.

17:59.200 --> 18:00.600
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

18:00.600 --> 18:02.200
MY MOM MUST HAVE
THROWN THEM AWAY

18:02.200 --> 18:04.200
WITHOUT
SHOWING THEM TO ME.

18:04.200 --> 18:06.300
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

18:06.300 --> 18:08.767
YOU'RE ASHAMED OF ME.
YOU ALWAYS WERE.

18:08.767 --> 18:10.000
SHAWN--
LET ME GO.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.033
NO.

18:11.033 --> 18:13.000
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING
TO HIM.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
OK?

18:14.000 --> 18:15.867
NOW LISTEN
TO WHAT HE HAS TO SAY.

18:15.867 --> 18:16.867
DON'T GET IN
THE MIDDLE OF THIS.

18:16.867 --> 18:18.133
NO, THE PROBLEM IS, SHAWN,

18:18.133 --> 18:19.767
I DIDN'T GET IN THE MIDDLE
OF THIS IN THE BEGINNING.

18:19.767 --> 18:22.734
YOU WERE BEHIND
YOUR CAMERA FROM
THE BEGINNING.

18:23.934 --> 18:26.700
I DIDN'T REALIZE
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

18:26.700 --> 18:30.400
LISTEN, IT'S NOT
ABOUT MY FILM ANYMORE.

18:31.500 --> 18:33.600
IT'S TOO PERSONAL NOW.

18:34.667 --> 18:37.200
THIS IS YOUR LIFE.

18:38.400 --> 18:41.567
GIVE IT
A HAPPY ENDING, OK?

18:53.033 --> 18:55.233
DID SHE REALLY
THROW 'EM AWAY?

18:56.300 --> 18:57.834
I NEVER GOT 'EM, MAN.

18:57.834 --> 19:00.066
BUT IF YOU HAD...

19:00.066 --> 19:01.300
WOULD YOU HAVE
WRITTEN ME BACK?

19:01.300 --> 19:03.567
IF I HAD KNOWN
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME,

19:03.567 --> 19:06.767
I WOULD'VE GOTTEN
ON A BUS AND FOUND YOU.

19:07.834 --> 19:09.467
YEAH?

19:10.500 --> 19:13.900
I FOUND YOU NOW,
DIDN'T I?

19:15.000 --> 19:18.133
ALL I EVER WANTED
WAS A BROTHER.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.834
OK.

19:21.934 --> 19:23.667
YOU GOT ONE.

19:31.700 --> 19:33.834
AND CLEAN UP THIS MESS,
WILL YA?

19:33.834 --> 19:35.934
THIS ISN'T MY MESS,
THIS IS YOUR MESS.

19:35.934 --> 19:38.367
CLEAN UP THIS MESS,
YOU PIG.

19:38.367 --> 19:40.000
PIG?!

19:40.000 --> 19:42.600
DID YOU JUST CALL ME A PIG?

19:42.600 --> 19:45.200
MY BROTHER
JUST CALLED ME A PIG.

19:45.200 --> 19:47.033
I THINK THIS MIGHT WORK OUT.

19:47.033 --> 19:50.233
YESTERDAY,
SHAWN AND I WENT OUT
FOR A COUPLE OF HOT DOGS.

19:50.233 --> 19:52.834
NOT MUCH OF A STORY,
BUT IT'S A START.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.500
THEY GO ROUND AND ROUND.

20:03.500 --> 20:06.300
AND THAT'S WHAT DRIES THEM.

20:08.400 --> 20:10.767
I COULD'VE
BEEN A GOOD ERIC.

20:10.767 --> 20:12.600
I WASN'T GIVEN A CHANCE.

20:12.600 --> 20:14.867
HE WASN'T AS GOOD AN ERIC
AS HE THOUGHT.

20:14.867 --> 20:17.900
HE COASTED.
TOOK THE JOB FOR GRANTED.

20:17.900 --> 20:20.300
WE COULDN'T
TELL MORGAN THIS,

20:20.300 --> 20:22.000
BUT HE STOLE.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.400
WE FOUND THIS
IN HIS BACKPACK.

20:28.834 --> 20:32.767
I'M THINKING OF PUTTING
MY HOUSE UP FOR SALE.

20:32.767 --> 20:35.734
I THOUGHT ONCE THE KIDS
STARTED GETTING OLDER,

20:35.734 --> 20:39.667
THINGS WOULD QUIET DOWN,
BUT, UH...

20:39.667 --> 20:41.767
IT JUST GETS WEIRDER.

20:41.767 --> 20:44.400
I'VE BEEN MEETING WITH
THE PEOPLE AT DISNEY.

20:44.400 --> 20:46.500
THEY ARE VERY INTERESTED
IN MY FILM.

20:46.500 --> 20:47.934
THEY'RE TALKING
3-PICTURE DEAL.

20:47.934 --> 20:51.467
PERSONALLY, I'M THINKING ABOUT
GOING THE INDEPENDENT ROUTE.

20:51.467 --> 20:54.500
MAYBE THE SUNDANCE
FILM FESTIVAL.

20:54.500 --> 20:58.100
[SIGHS] I NEED TO THINK.

20:59.700 --> 21:02.600
Cory: THIS IS THE STORY
OF JACK, SHAWN, AND ERIC:

21:02.600 --> 21:03.900
3 NEW ROOMMATES.

21:03.900 --> 21:06.300
THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT,
AND THEY'VE MADE IT.

21:06.300 --> 21:08.734
NOW NOTHING
WILL TEAR THEM APART.

21:08.734 --> 21:10.367
YOU'RE BREATHING
LOUD AGAIN.

21:10.367 --> 21:12.100
SO I'M
A LOUD BREATHER.

21:12.100 --> 21:14.500
WHY CAN'T YOU
BREATHE MORE LIKE ME?

21:14.500 --> 21:16.934
Cory: WHAT DO I KNOW?
