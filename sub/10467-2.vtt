WEBVTT

00:04.613 --> 00:07.572
I HAVE PUT TOGETHER
THE ULTIMATE CARE PACKAGE
FOR CLAUDIA.

00:07.572 --> 00:10.140
I FOUND THOSE
PEANUT BUTTER PRETZEL
THINGS SHE LIKES,

00:10.140 --> 00:12.577
AND 4 PAPERBACKS
ON YOUNG MUSICIANS
IN LOVE.

00:12.577 --> 00:13.796
LISTEN TO THIS.

00:13.796 --> 00:15.406
A VERITABLE MEDLEY
OF GUMMI BEARS--

00:15.406 --> 00:16.886
KIRSTEN!WHAT?

00:16.886 --> 00:18.409
LISTEN TO THIS.

00:18.409 --> 00:20.150
Answering machine:
CHARLIE, IT'S DAPHNE.

00:20.150 --> 00:22.283
YOU GOTTA STOP--
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T
KEEP CALLING ME.

00:22.283 --> 00:24.546
I CAN'T THINK.
I'M JUST--
I DON'T KNOW.

00:24.546 --> 00:27.157
COULD YOU TURN DOWN
THE MUSIC? PLEASE?!

00:27.157 --> 00:30.291
YOU'RE MAKING ME CRAZY,
CHARLIE. YOU GOTTA STOP.

00:30.291 --> 00:32.032
YOU GOTTA
LEAVE ME ALONE.

00:33.120 --> 00:35.731
CAN YOU
BELIEVE THAT?

00:35.731 --> 00:37.298
I'M MAKING HER CRAZY.

00:37.298 --> 00:39.778
SHE TAKES OFF,
BARELY SAYS A WORD TO ME...

00:39.778 --> 00:42.564
IS CAMPING OUT ON
SOME GUY'S COUCH THAT
I DON'T EVEN KNOW,

00:42.564 --> 00:44.087
AND I'M MAKING HER CRAZY.

00:45.958 --> 00:47.830
I'M GONNA LEAVE
YOU ALONE.

00:49.397 --> 00:51.921
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?DAPHNE AND I

00:51.921 --> 00:54.576
ARE GONNA
GET A FEW THINGS
STRAIGHT RIGHT NOW.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.973
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.WHAT?

01:00.973 --> 01:06.283
IT'S DISCONNECTED.
SHE DISCONNECTED
THE PHONE.

01:06.283 --> 01:09.678
WELL...THAT
WAS A STUPID
THING TO DO.

01:09.678 --> 01:12.246
MAN, I DON'T...

01:12.246 --> 01:15.597
HOW DO I KNOW
SHE'S NOT GONNA JUST
TAKE OFF AND GO?

01:15.597 --> 01:17.077
FOR ALL I KNOW,
SHE'S ALREADY GONE.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.861
SHE COULD
DO ANYTHING.

01:18.861 --> 01:20.297
SHE COULD LEAVE
THE STATE. SHE COULD
LEAVE THE COUNTRY.

01:20.297 --> 01:21.951
THEN HOW
WILL I FIND HER?

01:25.259 --> 01:27.130
THEN I'M NEVER
GONNA FIND HER.

02:07.475 --> 02:09.912
PUNCH IN LATE,
I'LL DOCK YOU.

02:09.912 --> 02:12.480
DON'T MEET
YOUR SANDWICH QUOTA,
I'LL DOCK YOU.

02:12.480 --> 02:15.613

02:15.613 --> 02:18.964
WOW. I--I DIDN'T KNOW
ANYONE COULD LOOK GOOD
IN THESE HATS.

02:18.964 --> 02:20.183
JOSH!

02:20.183 --> 02:21.445
YOU TWO KNOW
EACH OTHER?

02:21.445 --> 02:23.055
YEAH.
NOT REALLY.

02:23.055 --> 02:25.580
I DON'T USUALLY LET
FRIENDS WORK TOGETHER.

02:25.580 --> 02:27.582
TOO MANY DISTRACTIONS.

02:27.582 --> 02:29.627
I'VE GOT MY EYE
ON YOU TWO.

02:32.195 --> 02:35.590
LOOKS LIKE IT'S
UP TO ME TO SHOW
YOU THE ROPES.

02:35.590 --> 02:36.765
SPEARS OR CHIPS?

02:36.765 --> 02:38.680
YOU READ THE MANUAL.

02:38.680 --> 02:40.638
NO. MY FAMILY
OWNS A RESTAURANT.

02:40.638 --> 02:43.163
BIG MISTAKE
PUTTING THAT DOWN ON MY
WORK STUDY APPLICATION.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.165
THAT'S NOT WHY
YOU GOT THE JOB.

02:46.905 --> 02:48.690
I GOT A BUDDY
IN WORK STUDY.

02:48.690 --> 02:51.127
AND YOU...PULLED SOME STRINGS,

02:51.127 --> 02:53.912
PROMISED I'D WRITE
HIS TERM PAPER,
AND DO HIS LAUNDRY.

02:53.912 --> 02:55.436
JUST FOR A MONTH.

02:55.436 --> 02:57.133
ALL TO GET ME
ASSIGNED NEXT TO YOU?

02:57.133 --> 02:59.309
I JUST THOUGHT,
YOU KNOW, WE'RE
BOTH WRITERS,

02:59.309 --> 03:00.832
WE'RE BOTH STUCK
IN WORK STUDY.

03:00.832 --> 03:02.356
WHY NOT MAKE IT FUN?

03:02.356 --> 03:04.227
YOU KNOW, SPAR OVER
WHETHER CORDELIA'S

03:04.227 --> 03:06.011
REALLY KING LEAR'S
BEST DAUGHTER

03:06.011 --> 03:07.796
OR JUST A PAIN
IN THE BUTT

03:07.796 --> 03:09.624
WHO CAUSED ALL
HIS PROBLEMS...

03:09.624 --> 03:12.279
WHILE WE'RE
CHOPPING TOMATOES.

03:12.279 --> 03:15.978
BUT IF YOU WANT
ME TO GO BACK
TO MY BUDDY...

03:15.978 --> 03:19.590
HAND ME SOME GLOVES.YOU SURE?

03:19.590 --> 03:21.766
SPEAKING FROM
A STRICTLY FEMINIST
PERSPECTIVE,

03:21.766 --> 03:23.551
IT WOULDN'T HAVE
KILLED CORDELIA

03:23.551 --> 03:25.988
TO BE A LITTLE MORE
PROACTIVE.

03:30.166 --> 03:32.168
DON'T HELP ME OUT
OR ANYTHING.

03:32.168 --> 03:33.169
OH!

03:33.169 --> 03:34.083
SORRY.

03:37.173 --> 03:39.175
THANKS.
I GOT THE REST.

03:39.175 --> 03:40.785
IS THIS ALL THERE IS?

03:40.785 --> 03:42.787
ALL? THAT'S ABOUT
5 DAYS' WORTH...

03:42.787 --> 03:45.181
ON ACCOUNT OF
HOW THIS MAILMAN

03:45.181 --> 03:49.794
CAN'T SEEM TO GET DOWN
WITH HOW REEVES LIVES
WITH SALINGER.

03:49.794 --> 03:52.014
THE GUY'S CLEARLY
A MENTAL GIANT.

03:52.014 --> 03:54.843
HEY, SOME OF THAT
MIGHT BE FOR ME.

03:54.843 --> 03:57.367
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL
WITH THE MAIL ANYWAY?

03:57.367 --> 04:00.283
I HAVEN'T HEARD
FROM MY MOTHER
IN 2 MONTHS.

04:00.283 --> 04:02.067
UH-HUH. I SEE.
SO YOU'RE UPSET

04:02.067 --> 04:04.244
BECAUSE YOU
HAVEN'T GOTTEN
ONE OF HER LETTERS,

04:04.244 --> 04:07.682
WHICH WHEN YOU DO GET,
YOU JUST THROW IN
A DRAWER ANYWAY.

04:07.682 --> 04:10.032
I'VE SEEN YOU.
YOU DON'T EVEN
READ THEM.

04:10.032 --> 04:13.209
YEAH. WELL, IT'S
BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT
THEY'RE GONNA SAY.

04:13.209 --> 04:17.431
YOU KNOW, HOW IT WAS
A BAD IDEA FOR ME
TO MOVE IN WITH YOU,

04:17.431 --> 04:19.476
AND HOW I HURT THEM.

04:19.476 --> 04:21.304
WHO NEEDS TO READ
THAT STUFF ANYWAY?

04:21.304 --> 04:23.741
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE I
DON'T LIKE TO GET THEM.

04:23.741 --> 04:27.310
LOOK AT THIS--
"COMMITTEE TO SAVE
THE ATTACK RIFLE."

04:27.310 --> 04:31.009
WHY ME? WHAT MAKES THEM
THINK I WOULD FORK OVER
GOOD MONEY--

04:31.009 --> 04:33.011
BAILEY, I'M WORRIED.

04:33.011 --> 04:36.276
DON'T BE. I PROMISE,
NOT ONE DIME.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.278
NOT ABOUT THAT.
ABOUT MY PARENTS.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.323
THEY COULD BE SICK
OR SOMETHING.

04:40.323 --> 04:42.717
MY DAD'S HEART
IS NOT THAT GREAT.

04:42.717 --> 04:45.023
REALLY? YOU NEVER
TOLD ME THAT.

04:45.023 --> 04:48.418
YEAH. HIS FAMILY
HAS A HISTORY OF
HEART DISEASE.

04:48.418 --> 04:53.554
WELL, MAYBE YOU JUST...
YOU KNOW...MISS THEM.

04:53.554 --> 04:56.644
NO. NO. I AM WORRIED.
I TOLD YOU.

04:56.644 --> 04:58.950
SARAH, THAT'S ALLOWED.

04:58.950 --> 05:00.604
YOU'RE ALLOWED
TO MISS THEM.

05:00.604 --> 05:02.432
I MEAN, THEY'RE
YOUR PARENTS, RIGHT?

05:04.434 --> 05:07.002
SO, WE FIGURED ONCE
THE BABY WAS BORN,

05:07.002 --> 05:09.439
IF SHE COULDN'T HANDLE
BEING A MOTHER...

05:09.439 --> 05:11.180
I'D BE THE MOTHER...
AND THE FATHER.

05:11.180 --> 05:13.095
I'D DO IT MYSELF.

05:13.095 --> 05:16.272
I SEE. AND YOU HAVE
THIS AGREEMENT IN
WRITING, RIGHT?

05:16.272 --> 05:18.448
NOT EXACTLY,
BUT SHE KNOWS THAT.

05:18.448 --> 05:21.451
DAPHNE KNOWS
HOW IMPORTANT
THIS KID IS TO ME,

05:21.451 --> 05:24.411
AND THAT'S WHY...
IF SHE TAKES OFF,

05:24.411 --> 05:26.413
WE GOTTA STOP HER.

05:26.413 --> 05:29.764
I MEAN, IT'S TAKEN ME
A LONG TIME TO FIGURE OUT

05:29.764 --> 05:31.983
WHAT I WANT,
HOW I SEE MY LIFE,

05:31.983 --> 05:34.464
AND BEING SICK,
HAVING CANCER,

05:34.464 --> 05:36.858
KIND OF MADE EVERYTHING
COME INTO FOCUS.

05:36.858 --> 05:39.469
I'M SORRY.
YOU HAD CANCER?

05:42.080 --> 05:45.649
YEAH. BUT, UH...
I'M OK. I'M FINE.

05:45.649 --> 05:49.305
I GOT THE ALL CLEAR FROM
MY DOCTOR 8 MONTHS AGO,

05:49.305 --> 05:51.525
AND IT'S TOTALLY BEHIND ME.

05:51.525 --> 05:55.659
AND, UM, I'M COVERED,
INSURANCE-WISE,
THROUGH MY BROTHER.

05:55.659 --> 05:57.574
YOUR BROTHER?
WELL, WHY WOULDN'T...

05:59.359 --> 06:01.491
DOES YOUR JOB NOT HAVE
HEALTH BENEFITS?

06:03.624 --> 06:06.017
WELL...

06:06.017 --> 06:08.455
SEE, UH...

06:08.455 --> 06:11.153
I DON'T HAVE A JOB
RIGHT AT THE MOMENT.

06:11.153 --> 06:12.502
I WAS RUNNING
OUR FAMILY BUSINESS--

06:12.502 --> 06:13.808
CHARLIE.

06:13.808 --> 06:15.766
I AM DOING SOME
CARPENTRY OVER THERE.

06:15.766 --> 06:16.637
CHARLIE.

06:18.421 --> 06:20.858
THERE'S NO POINT IN
MY TAKING YOUR CASE

06:20.858 --> 06:24.427
BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU
RIGHT NOW, WE'D LOSE.

06:24.427 --> 06:27.430
NOW, I'VE BEEN DOING
THIS A LONG TIME,

06:27.430 --> 06:30.433
AND I GAVE NEVER
SEEN A JUDGE AWARD
FULL CUSTODY

06:30.433 --> 06:32.522
TO AN UNMARRIED,
UNEMPLOYED DAD.

06:32.522 --> 06:34.350
IT'S JUST NOT
GONNA HAPPEN.

06:37.614 --> 06:41.052
LOOK, EITHER YOU GO OUT
AND YOU FIND A JOB,

06:41.052 --> 06:45.100
OR THE COURT WILL SAY
THE BABY IS BETTER OFF
WITH ITS MOTHER.

06:47.755 --> 06:50.584

06:50.584 --> 06:52.586

OH, MAN, DAVE...

06:58.287 --> 07:01.943
YOU'RE, LIKE,
THE BEST SONGWRITER
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

07:01.943 --> 07:04.728
OBVIOUSLY, YOU
DON'T GET OUT MUCH.

07:04.728 --> 07:06.948
NOT FOR ABOUT 7 MONTHS.

07:06.948 --> 07:10.299
CHARLIE WON'T EVEN LET ME
CRANK THE STEREO.

07:10.299 --> 07:13.476
OH, REMEMBER THAT TIME
WHEN YOU STILL LIVED
UPSTAIRS FROM ME,

07:13.476 --> 07:15.652
AND THAT GUY ACROSS
THE HALL CALLED
THE COPS ON US?

07:15.652 --> 07:19.700
YEAH! OH, MY GOD!
THAT WAS MY 21st
BIRTHDAY PARTY.

07:19.700 --> 07:23.617
YOU, STAN, AND ISAAC
PLAYED ME THE BEATLES'
BIRTHDAY SONG--

07:23.617 --> 07:25.532
FOR, LIKE,
12 HOURS STRAIGHT.

07:25.532 --> 07:29.884
YEAH! HA! OH, MAN...
I MISS THOSE GUYS.

07:29.884 --> 07:32.713
SO, LET'S CALL 'EM,
GET 'EM OVER HERE.

07:32.713 --> 07:34.541
WAIT. WHERE
ARE YOU GOING?

07:34.541 --> 07:37.152
UH, PAY PHONE.

07:37.152 --> 07:40.372
I SORT OF FORGOT TO
PAY THE PHONE BILL,

07:40.372 --> 07:42.505
AND THEY KINDA
TURNED IT OFF, HEH.

07:43.941 --> 07:44.855
DAVE?

07:48.598 --> 07:49.686
DAVE!

07:52.515 --> 07:55.039
WHAT DO THEY DO AT
A KIWANIS MEETING,
ANYWAY?

07:55.039 --> 07:57.694
THEY COULD
SACRIFICE A VIRGIN,
FOR ALL I KNOW.

07:57.694 --> 08:01.872
I BRING THE FOOD,
THEY PAY THE BILL, AND
YOU GET THE LEFTOVERS.

08:01.872 --> 08:02.917
EVERYBODY'S HAPPY.

08:05.876 --> 08:09.271
SO, WOW...DORM LIFE.
NOT BAD.

08:09.271 --> 08:12.056
I COULD SEE LIVING
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS.

08:12.056 --> 08:14.058
COME ON, YOU
HATED COLLEGE.

08:14.058 --> 08:16.191
THE WAY I DID IT,
YEAH--

08:16.191 --> 08:18.585
HALF IN SCHOOL AND
HALF AT THE RESTAURANT.

08:18.585 --> 08:20.500
YOU WERE JUST
WORKING TOO MUCH.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.893
3 HOURS A DAY
IS NOT SO BAD.

08:22.893 --> 08:26.114
3...WHAT?
YOU'RE WORKING?

08:26.114 --> 08:27.898
FOOD SERVICES.
WANNA SEE MY HAT?

08:27.898 --> 08:30.031
WAIT A SECOND.

08:30.031 --> 08:32.512
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
TO WORK ON TOP OF BEING
A FULL-TIME STUDENT.

08:32.512 --> 08:33.861
I CAN HANDLE IT.

08:33.861 --> 08:35.689
YEAH, BUT YOU
SHOULDN'T HAVE TO.

08:35.689 --> 08:38.300
THIS IS STANFORD.
JULE, YOU GOTTA
KEEP ON THE BALL.

08:38.300 --> 08:40.911
YOU GOTTA STAY FOCUSED.
IF YOU'RE NOT IN CLASS,

08:40.911 --> 08:42.173
THEN YOU SHOULD BE
IN THE LIBRARY.

08:42.173 --> 08:44.262
OH, GEE, THANKS, DAD.

08:44.262 --> 08:46.613
OR HANGING OUT WITH
FRIENDS. THAT'S PART
OF COLLEGE, TOO--

08:46.613 --> 08:48.223
HAVING FUN.

08:48.223 --> 08:52.270
WELL, THE THING IS,
IT SORT OF IS FUN.

08:52.270 --> 08:54.359
LOOK, I KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

08:54.359 --> 08:56.666
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT
THE MONEY, RIGHT?

08:56.666 --> 09:00.627
WELL, DON'T BE, BECAUSE
I WOULD BE REALLY HAPPY
TO HELP OUT.

09:00.627 --> 09:02.542
I'LL JUST WRITE YOU--BAILEY, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THAT.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.848
I KNOW. I WANT TO.BUT I'M TELLING YOU--

09:04.848 --> 09:07.503
LOOK, WILL YOU
SHUT UP AND JUST
LET ME DO THIS?

09:07.503 --> 09:09.461
PLEASE? REALLY...

09:09.461 --> 09:12.377
IT'LL MAKE ME
HAPPY KNOWING THAT
AT LEAST ONE OF US

09:12.377 --> 09:14.466
HAD A PURE
COLLEGE EXPERIENCE.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.253
GO TELL THEM
YOU QUIT.

09:21.778 --> 09:24.346
I CANNOT SPEND
ANOTHER WEEKEND HELD
HOSTAGE AT HANOVER.

09:24.346 --> 09:26.957
I MEAN, IF WE
DON'T GO TO BOSTON,
I'LL DIE.

09:26.957 --> 09:29.351
YOU THINK
YOUR DOOFUS BROTHER
WILL DRIVE US?

09:29.351 --> 09:32.528
BOSTON, COOL.
THAT'S, LIKE, 50 MILES
FROM HERE, RIGHT?

09:32.528 --> 09:35.792
OH, I HAVE JUST BEEN
DYING TO CHECK OUT
HARVARD SQUARE.

09:35.792 --> 09:37.489
UH-HUH.

09:37.489 --> 09:40.971
MY BROTHER--
HE HAS 28 UNPAID
PARKING TICKETS.

09:40.971 --> 09:42.930
MY DAD TOOK
THE CAR AWAY.

09:42.930 --> 09:45.410
OK, LET'S START.
LAST NIGHT'S HOMEWORK,

09:45.410 --> 09:50.415
QUESTION ONE:
2 SUBSTANCES, EQUAL MASS,
UNEQUAL VOLUME.

09:50.415 --> 09:52.548
WHICH HAS
THE SMALLER DENSITY...

09:52.548 --> 09:54.158
MS...HAMILTON?

09:55.943 --> 09:57.031
I DON'T KNOW.

09:57.031 --> 09:58.685
MS. BROOKS?

09:58.685 --> 10:00.077
I DON'T KNOW.

10:01.557 --> 10:03.864
MS...SALINGER?

10:05.169 --> 10:06.475
I DON'T KNOW.

10:06.475 --> 10:08.782
SOUNDS LIKE A TRIO.

10:08.782 --> 10:11.262
MS. HAMILTON, THINK.

10:11.262 --> 10:12.612
HARD.

ON YOUR FEET.

22:04.627 --> 22:06.325
THIS, UH--
THIS TEACHING GIG.

22:06.325 --> 22:07.891
THAT'S JUST TEMPORARY,
RIGHT?

22:07.891 --> 22:09.980
UNTIL YOU GET
THIS THING SETTLED.

22:09.980 --> 22:13.027
NO, BAY.WHY NOT?

22:13.027 --> 22:16.073
BECAUSE THIS
IS NOT ABOUT ME JUST
LOOKING RESPONSIBLE

22:16.073 --> 22:18.859
FOR THE 15 MINUTES
THE JUDGE IS
REVIEWING MY FILE.

22:18.859 --> 22:21.514
IT'S ABOUT ME REALLY
MAKING A COMMITMENT
TO SOMETHING

22:21.514 --> 22:23.167
THAT WILL ALLOW ME
TO KEEP MY KID.

22:23.167 --> 22:25.561
SO YOU'RE COMMITTING
TO BEING A SHOP TEACHER?

22:25.561 --> 22:29.870
COME ON, MAN.
WE USED TO MAKE FUN
OF THOSE GUYS.

22:29.870 --> 22:31.698
REMEMBER MR. SINCLAIR...

22:31.698 --> 22:35.092
WITH THE DANDRUFF
AND THE MISSING PINKY?

22:35.092 --> 22:37.834
IT'S A JOB, BAILEY,
AND I NEEDED A JOB.

22:37.834 --> 22:41.490
SO IS BEING AN ARCHITECT.
WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT?

22:41.490 --> 22:43.100
YOUR WHOLE LIFE,
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED.

22:43.100 --> 22:45.276
THAT TAKES TIME...
AND MONEY.

22:45.276 --> 22:48.497
I GOTTA BE AN INTERN,
I GOTTA GO TO SCHOOL...

22:48.497 --> 22:51.108
OK, SO I'LL PAY FOR THAT.I DON'T WANT YOU TO.

22:51.108 --> 22:54.503
LOOK, I KNOW HOW MUCH
YOU LIKE TO WHIP OUT
THE CHECKBOOK

22:54.503 --> 22:56.375
AND BE EVERYBODY'S
FIXER,

22:56.375 --> 22:58.464
BUT YOU CAN'T FIX
THIS ONE.

22:58.464 --> 23:03.556
OK? I GOTTA SHOW
THE COURT THAT I CAN
SUPPORT MY BABY--ME.

23:03.556 --> 23:06.559
AND NOT
MY LITTLE BROTHER
OR ANYBODY ELSE.

23:06.559 --> 23:10.127
AND IT DOESN'T
MATTER WHAT BIG PLANS
I HAD TO GIVE UP

23:10.127 --> 23:12.129
OR WHAT JOB
I GOTTA TAKE.

23:12.129 --> 23:15.698
WHATEVER IT TAKES,
I'LL DO IT.
I DON'T CARE.

23:15.698 --> 23:19.049
IF IT MEANS I GET
TO KEEP MY BABY.

23:28.755 --> 23:30.670
OH, COME ON.
JEWEL WOULDN'T
EVEN EXIST

23:30.670 --> 23:32.411
IF IT WEREN'T
FOR JONI MITCHELL.

23:32.411 --> 23:34.369
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

23:34.369 --> 23:37.807
YOU WERE MEANT
FOR ME IS A CLASSIC
IN ITS OWN RIGHT.

23:37.807 --> 23:39.896
PLEASE! BLUE,

THE CANYON.

23:41.811 --> 23:44.248
YOU JUST LIKE JEWEL
'CAUSE SHE'S GOT
BIG BOOBS.

23:44.248 --> 23:47.034
I THINK SHE'S
GENUINELY TALENTED.

23:47.034 --> 23:48.905
WHAT'S WRONG WITH
BIG BOOBS ANYWAY?

23:48.905 --> 23:50.951
WHAT DO YOU
THINK, JULIA?

23:50.951 --> 23:55.129
HMM? YOU ARE NOT
DRAGGING ME INTO YOUR
LITTLE LOVERS QUARREL.

23:55.129 --> 23:57.392
I'VE GOTTA GET
TO CLASS. BYE!

23:57.392 --> 23:58.785
BYE!

23:58.785 --> 24:01.309
YOU HAVE
THE WORST TASTE
IN MUSIC,

24:01.309 --> 24:03.746
BUT YOU GOT
SUCH GREAT TASTE
IN WOMEN.

24:11.188 --> 24:15.192
I ALWAYS THOUGHT
HER LETTERS WOULD
BE ABOUT ME--

24:15.192 --> 24:18.979
HOW WRONG I WAS...

24:18.979 --> 24:20.589
"BAILEY'S NOT RIGHT
FOR YOU."

24:20.589 --> 24:23.810
"YOU DON'T KNOW HOW
TO LIVE YOUR LIFE."

24:23.810 --> 24:26.421
AND THEY'RE NOT?

24:26.421 --> 24:28.467
YEAH, FOR A WHILE,
THEY WERE.

24:30.033 --> 24:33.254
THEN SHE JUST SAID,
"COME BACK."

24:33.254 --> 24:34.908
YOU KNOW?
NO MATTER WHAT.

24:36.605 --> 24:39.695
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I SHOULD'VE.

24:39.695 --> 24:42.872
'CAUSE IT'S LIKE AFTER
I LEFT, THEY HAD NOTHING
TO TALK ABOUT.

24:42.872 --> 24:45.571
THEY EVEN STOPPED
FIGHTING FOR A WHILE.

24:47.747 --> 24:51.577
GOD, MY MOM, AFTER
I LEFT, SHE JUST...

24:51.577 --> 24:54.144
AFTER YOU LEFT?

24:54.144 --> 24:56.756
SARAH, NO.

24:56.756 --> 25:01.761
NO. THEY DIDN'T
BREAK UP BECAUSE
OF YOU.

25:01.761 --> 25:04.154
I MEAN,
REMEMBER THAT.

25:04.154 --> 25:06.330
REMEMBER HOW THEY
PUSHED YOU AWAY.

25:06.330 --> 25:08.463
THEY PUSHED YOU.

25:08.463 --> 25:10.247
YEAH, BUT IF I HAD
READ THESE LETTERS

25:10.247 --> 25:12.249
LIKE NORMAL PEOPLE DO
WHEN THEY GET MAIL...

25:12.249 --> 25:13.903

NO. IF I HAD
READ THESE

25:13.903 --> 25:15.557
AND GONE TO SEE
THEM...

25:17.559 --> 25:18.995
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

25:23.434 --> 25:25.698
IF I MIX A MOLE OF SODIUM

25:25.698 --> 25:28.135
WITH A BEAKER OF H2O...

25:28.135 --> 25:30.267

MS. BROOKS.

25:30.267 --> 25:32.966

25:32.966 --> 25:35.403

HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT.

25:35.403 --> 25:37.666
IT'S GONNA BE
ON THE TEST.

25:37.666 --> 25:40.756

ABOUT SODIUM AND H2O,

26:28.456 --> 26:32.852

26:38.814 --> 26:40.816

PUT THEM TOGETHER

I'D BEEN UP FOR, LIKE,
24 HOURS STRAIGHT

LOST THE LUXURY OF
PEEING IN PRIVATE,

HAVEN'T EATEN ANY REAL

28:15.563 --> 28:17.826

NOT TAKING CARE OF IT.

NOT EVERYTHING.

33:19.693 --> 33:21.695
BUT ESSENTIALLY,
SHE WAS A STRIPPER.

33:21.695 --> 33:23.262
SHE SUPPORTED HERSELF
BY STRIPPING.

33:24.828 --> 33:26.482

FIRST MOVED HERE, SHE--

33:41.628 --> 33:44.457
BUT THAT WAS TOTALLY
NOT HER FAULT. LOOK...

33:46.198 --> 33:48.722
SHE WAS REALLY YOUNG.

33:48.722 --> 33:51.072
DO YOU WANT TO
WIN THIS CASE, CHARLIE?

33:53.814 --> 33:56.860
SHE WAS DANCING IN
SOME CLUB, JUST DANCING,

33:56.860 --> 34:00.777
AND I GUESS THE MANAGER
WAS RUNNING SOME KIND OF
ESCORT SERVICE ON THE SIDE,

34:00.777 --> 34:04.912
AND ONE NIGHT,
THE POLICE MADE A SWEEP...

34:04.912 --> 34:06.740
OK,

34:06.740 --> 34:10.135
WE CAN USE THAT.
PROSTITUTION ARREST.

34:10.135 --> 34:11.701
ANYTHING ELSE?

34:24.801 --> 34:26.890
Owen: CHARLIE,
OVER HERE!

34:28.414 --> 34:29.850
MAN, THAT TOOK FOREVER.

34:29.850 --> 34:32.070
I KNOW IT DID, KIDDO.
I'M SORRY.

34:32.070 --> 34:33.854
WE FOUND
A PARKING SPACE,

34:33.854 --> 34:36.030
WHICH MEANS WE
SHOULD PROBABLY JUST
EAT IN THE AREA.

34:36.030 --> 34:37.249
OK.

34:37.249 --> 34:39.120
SO, TELL ME.

34:42.254 --> 34:43.646
IT DIDN'T GO GREAT.

34:43.646 --> 34:45.692
NO, IT'S, UH...

34:45.692 --> 34:49.826
SHE THINKS WE'RE IN
PRETTY GOOD SHAPE,
ACTUALLY.

34:49.826 --> 34:51.263
OK?

34:51.263 --> 34:53.091
IT'S JUST...

34:53.091 --> 34:56.442
I TOLD HER SOME
STUFF ABOUT DAPHNE,

34:56.442 --> 34:58.531
THINGS THAT I
SHOULDN'T HAVE,

34:58.531 --> 35:01.708
STUFF DAPHNE
TOLD ME WHEN...

35:01.708 --> 35:03.666
WELL, YOU KNOW WHEN
YOU'RE FIRST GETTING
TO KNOW SOMEBODY

35:03.666 --> 35:05.059
AND YOU WANT THEM
TO LIKE YOU,

35:05.059 --> 35:06.669
YOU--YOU TELL THEM
ALL YOUR STORIES,

35:06.669 --> 35:09.063
YOUR WORST MOMENTS,
YOUR BIGGEST MISTAKES,

35:09.063 --> 35:11.674
THE THINGS YOU
CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DID.

35:11.674 --> 35:13.850
AND YOU
TOLD YOUR LAWYER?

35:13.850 --> 35:15.722
YEAH, I TOLD HER.

35:17.637 --> 35:18.855
WHAT?

35:18.855 --> 35:20.553
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

35:20.553 --> 35:22.555
NOTHING.

35:22.555 --> 35:25.166
JERRY SPRINGER,
ACTUALLY.

35:25.166 --> 35:27.603
THAT'S WHAT
I WAS THINKING.

35:27.603 --> 35:29.649
YOU EVER WATCH
SHOWS LIKE THAT

35:29.649 --> 35:32.260
WHERE THESE CRAZY
PEOPLE JUST TURN ON
EACH OTHER

35:32.260 --> 35:34.610
AND THEY REVEAL
ALL THIS PAINFUL,
PRIVATE STUFF?

35:34.610 --> 35:36.525
AND IT'S FUN
TO WATCH, RIGHT,

35:36.525 --> 35:37.700
'CAUSE IT
DOESN'T SEEM REAL.

35:37.700 --> 35:39.485
BUT YOU NEVER
ACTUALLY THINK,

35:39.485 --> 35:41.617
"GOD, THAT COULD
BE ME UP THERE.

35:41.617 --> 35:43.576
I'M CAPABLE
OF THAT."

35:45.621 --> 35:47.145
BUT, I MEAN,

35:47.145 --> 35:49.886
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU
HAD A CHOICE, RIGHT?

36:06.251 --> 36:07.513
LOOK, I...

36:07.513 --> 36:08.949
UM...

36:13.388 --> 36:16.391
I KNOW YOU--YOU ALL
HATE ME HERE.

36:16.391 --> 36:18.872
I MEAN, YOU THINK
I'M LIKE THIS

36:18.872 --> 36:20.352
BRAINIAC,

36:20.352 --> 36:21.962
GEEK.

36:21.962 --> 36:23.920
AND IT'S TRUE.

36:23.920 --> 36:25.922
I--I CAN'T
CHANGE THAT.

36:25.922 --> 36:30.927
I MEAN,
I CAN'T JUST--JUST
FORGET WHAT I KNOW.

36:30.927 --> 36:32.886
WELL, SO IF
THAT'S THE WAY
IT HAS TO BE,

36:32.886 --> 36:34.931
THEN SO BE IT.

36:34.931 --> 36:39.109
IT'S JUST THE WAY
IT HAS TO BE.

36:39.109 --> 36:42.504
DO YOU THINK WE COULD GO
OVER TONIGHT'S ASSIGNMENT?

36:44.898 --> 36:45.812
SURE.

36:48.293 --> 36:49.903
YEAH. UH...

36:49.903 --> 36:51.948
SILVER CHLORIDE.

36:51.948 --> 36:53.950
WHAT'S IT LIKE?
UM...

36:53.950 --> 36:55.300
AH, LIKE
NEW MASCARA,

36:55.300 --> 36:56.953
SMOOTH, LIQUIDY,

36:56.953 --> 36:59.391
BUT YOU KNOW
WHEN IT GETS ALL
OLD AND CLUMPY?

36:59.391 --> 37:01.219
OH, I HATE THAT.
IT FLAKES OFF.

37:01.219 --> 37:03.090
YES, THAT'S
THE PRECIPITATE.

37:03.090 --> 37:04.831
[DOOR OPENS]

37:12.099 --> 37:13.361
WHAT'S A CATALYST?

37:14.493 --> 37:16.016
GOT A LIPSTICK?

37:22.501 --> 37:23.719
HELLO?

37:28.071 --> 37:29.116
HELLO!

37:29.116 --> 37:32.075
HEY, MAN.

37:32.075 --> 37:35.383
AREN'T YOU EVEN A LITTLE
BIT WORRIED ABOUT A STRANGE
GUY WALKING INTO YOUR HOUSE?

37:35.383 --> 37:37.516
MAYBE YOU
SHOULD GET A LOCK.

37:39.039 --> 37:40.606
YOU A COP?

37:40.606 --> 37:42.172
NO.

37:42.172 --> 37:45.045
THEN NO PROBLEM.

37:45.045 --> 37:48.004
LOOK, I'M LOOKING FOR DAPHNE.
I'VE GOTTA TALK TO HER.

37:48.004 --> 37:50.268
SHE'S NOT HERE.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.095
NOT HERE? WHAT DO
YOU MEAN NOT HERE?
SHE'S STAYING HERE, RIGHT?

37:52.095 --> 37:54.228
SHE TOLD ME SHE
WAS STAYING WITH YOU.

37:54.228 --> 37:56.361
SHE TOOK OFF
THIS MORNING.

37:56.361 --> 37:59.189
WITH WHO? WHERE?

37:59.189 --> 38:04.151
WHAT, YOU LET A PREGNANT
WOMAN WALK OUT OF HERE ALONE
WITH NO QUESTIONS, NOTHING?

38:04.151 --> 38:06.545
HEY, MAN,
DON'T YELL AT ME.

38:06.545 --> 38:08.242
SHE JUST LEFT.

38:10.200 --> 38:12.638
HEY, YOU WANT
SOME PIZZA, MAN?

38:12.638 --> 38:13.987
I NEED TO USE YOUR PHONE.

38:13.987 --> 38:15.205
UH...

38:17.207 --> 38:19.122

[LAUGHING]

38:33.615 --> 38:38.185
NO. UH, I THINK SHE
JUST NEEDS TO MEDITATE
FOR A WHILE,

38:38.185 --> 38:39.882
REGAIN HER CENTER.

38:39.882 --> 38:41.623
[SIGHS]

38:41.623 --> 38:45.410
WHY DID YOU TELL HIM
I WAS YOUR BOYFRIEND
ANYWAY?

38:47.194 --> 38:48.587
I DON'T KNOW.

38:48.587 --> 38:51.198
'CAUSE YOU WERE THERE

38:51.198 --> 38:54.114
AND YOU WERE NAKED,

38:54.114 --> 38:57.770
AND IT WAS
EITHER THAT OR...

38:57.770 --> 39:02.949
OR MAKE THIS
HUGE ANNOUNCEMENT
ABOUT HOW I FEEL

39:02.949 --> 39:05.778
ABOUT GUYS.

39:05.778 --> 39:07.736
WHICH IS HOW?

39:09.782 --> 39:11.087

39:14.787 --> 39:16.441
I'M MARRIED.

39:16.441 --> 39:19.008
WHOA.

39:19.008 --> 39:21.184
[LAUGHS] YEAH.

39:21.184 --> 39:24.449
ACTUALLY, I'M--
I'M NOT EVEN MARRIED,
I'M SEPARATED.

39:26.233 --> 39:28.148
AND I CAN'T--

39:28.148 --> 39:29.671
I KEEP...

39:32.152 --> 39:34.197
IT'S JUST SO WEIRD.

39:34.197 --> 39:36.809
'CAUSE FOR, LIKE,
THE LONGEST TIME

39:36.809 --> 39:40.813
I WAS COMPLETELY WRAPPED
UP IN THIS ONE GUY--

39:40.813 --> 39:44.817
GRIFFIN--AND--AND
NOW, ALL OF A SUDDEN,

39:44.817 --> 39:47.210
THERE'S THIS
OTHER GUY--JOSH--

39:47.210 --> 39:49.212
AND HE'S FUNNY,
AND HE'S SMART,

39:49.212 --> 39:51.563
AND HE'S
READ KING LEAR.

39:51.563 --> 39:52.999
I GET IT.

39:52.999 --> 39:54.348
NO, YOU DON'T.

39:54.348 --> 39:56.394

COLLEGE SWEETHEART

40:03.836 --> 40:06.229
UH, I MEAN, IT'S GREAT.

40:06.229 --> 40:09.232
WE KNOW EACH OTHER
BETTER THAN ANYONE.

40:09.232 --> 40:10.712
THERE'S NO SURPRISES.

40:12.671 --> 40:15.587
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT SUCKS?

40:17.719 --> 40:20.156
NO SURPRISES.

40:23.072 --> 40:24.683
I THINK IF
YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH

40:24.683 --> 40:26.946
TO MEET SOMEONE NEW
WHO YOU REALLY LIKE...

40:29.818 --> 40:32.604
I THINK YOU KINDA
OWE IT TO YOURSELF
TO GO FOR IT,

40:32.604 --> 40:36.303
EVEN IF YOU DID
SPEND HIGH SCHOOL IN
LOVE WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

40:47.140 --> 40:49.359
HEY, THERE'S
3 MOVIES AT CINE-CITY

40:49.359 --> 40:52.406
THAT START WITHIN
15 MINUTES OF EACH OTHER.

40:52.406 --> 40:55.757
I VOTE WE JUST SHOW UP
AND GO TO WHICHEVER ONE
WE'RE NOT LATE FOR.

40:55.757 --> 40:59.674
I VOTE WE GO TO THE ONE
WHERE THE WORLD DOESN'T
EXPLODE IN EVERY SCENE.

40:59.674 --> 41:02.329
THAT COULD BE TOUGH,

41:02.329 --> 41:05.027
DEFINITELY TOUGH,
BUT WE OUGHT TO GET GOING.

41:07.682 --> 41:11.730
YOU TAKE A SNAPSHOT
OF YOUR LIFE

41:11.730 --> 41:15.734
THE LAST TIME
YOU LEAVE SOMEPLACE.

41:15.734 --> 41:19.651
THEN I DON'T KNOW,
IT'S DUMB, BUT YOU THINK
IT'S NEVER GONNA CHANGE.

41:27.354 --> 41:30.270
YOU FIGURED
YOU COULD GO BACK
ANY NIGHT AT 11:00

41:30.270 --> 41:32.707
AND THEY'D BE
WATCHING NIGHTLINE.

41:35.623 --> 41:37.364
YEAH, YOU GET THIS.

41:38.713 --> 41:41.629
I'VE GOT SNAPSHOTS, TOO,

41:41.629 --> 41:43.718
WITH PARENTS IN THEM.

41:51.291 --> 41:52.901
YOU KNOW, I WAS
ALL SET TO THE TAKE
THE HIGH ROAD--

41:52.901 --> 41:55.121
CHARLIE--

41:55.121 --> 41:56.470
TO SEE IF MAYBE THE TWO
OF US COULDN'T FIND SOME
WAY TO WORK THIS OUT,

41:56.470 --> 41:57.819
BUT SCREW THAT.LISTEN--

41:57.819 --> 41:59.125
I DON'T CARE
WHAT I HAVE TO DO,

41:59.125 --> 42:00.692
I DON'T CARE
WHAT IT TAKES,

42:00.692 --> 42:01.780
I'M NOT TAKING ANOTHER
SECOND OF HER CRAP.

42:01.780 --> 42:02.781
CHARLIE, STOP.

42:02.781 --> 42:04.260
THIS IS CHARLIE SALINGER.

42:04.260 --> 42:06.306
I NEED TO SPEAK
TO MARTHA LEVITON RIGHT AWAY.

42:06.306 --> 42:07.394
DAPHNE'S DISAPPEARED.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
THE HELL SHE IS.

42:07.394 --> 42:08.613
CHARLIE...

42:37.903 --> 42:39.687
YOU'RE BACK.

42:39.687 --> 42:40.993
YEP...

42:42.908 --> 42:44.083
NO...

42:46.912 --> 42:49.349
I GUESS.

42:49.349 --> 42:51.177
WELL...

42:53.266 --> 42:55.094
I'M GLAD.

42:56.269 --> 42:58.619
THE THING IS,

42:58.619 --> 43:02.797
I DON'T REALLY WANT
TO BE HERE, CHARLIE.

43:04.103 --> 43:06.409
YOU AND ME,

43:06.409 --> 43:08.629
WE'RE NOT
RIGHT FOR EACH OTHER,
THAT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS.

43:12.894 --> 43:15.157
AND IF I COULD
GO SOMEPLACE ELSE...

43:17.464 --> 43:19.684
BUT I CAN'T.

43:22.077 --> 43:23.949
YOU SEE,

43:23.949 --> 43:26.386
I THOUGHT I COULD
JUST WALK AWAY.

43:28.301 --> 43:32.044
BUT NO MATTER
HOW FAR AWAY I WALK,

43:32.044 --> 43:34.307
THE BABY'S STILL THERE.

43:40.269 --> 43:42.837
I CAN'T DO THIS
BY MYSELF.

43:42.837 --> 43:44.317
SO...

43:46.058 --> 43:47.625
HERE I AM.

43:56.459 --> 43:57.635
COME INSIDE.
