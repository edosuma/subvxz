If you drove a car today, charged
your cell phone, or made breakfast,

00:16.516 --> 00:19.728
chances are Carrington Atlantic
had something to do with it.

00:19.811 --> 00:21.479
Oh, my God. Hi, Daddy.

00:21.563 --> 00:23.231
This is Cristal, my fiancée.

00:23.314 --> 00:26.276
My dad said "get to know her."
That's what I need you to do.

-Goodbye.

-Sam.

-Your father offered me the COO position.
-That was supposed to be mine.

-You the black sheep of your family, too?
-No. She is.

00:39.247 --> 00:42.542
-I know everything.
-I have an investment opportunity for you.

your new competition.

00:48.006 --> 00:51.593

Windbriar, you heard of it?

Thought you were interested
in what's above ground.

00:54.137 --> 00:56.681

he's gonna cover his bases.

05:09.142 --> 05:13.146
Detectives at the scene think there was
a malfunction with the thumper truck.

05:13.229 --> 05:15.690
The blast seriously injured Blaisdel

05:15.773 --> 05:19.569
and a shard struck the wind turbine
that sealed the deal.

05:19.652 --> 05:24.574
But the faulty truck was
Carrington Atlantic owned and operated.

05:24.657 --> 05:26.492

10:41.974 --> 10:43.309
[Blake]  Last night was a fiasco.

10:45.019 --> 10:46.312
But we got through it.

10:47.104 --> 10:50.316
The photos weren't bad.
Unconscious is a good look for you.

10:51.233 --> 10:52.693
Not today, all right?

10:53.444 --> 10:56.656
I've been thinking about it,
and we need to present a united front

10:56.739 --> 10:58.449
to the police and the press,

10:58.532 --> 11:01.410
which means eliminating anything
that might undermine that.

11:01.494 --> 11:04.955
Starting with that photo you sent me,
Fallon, of Cristal and Matthew.

11:05.039 --> 11:09.335
-Because it proves Cristal killed him?
-Because it risks damaging her reputation.

11:09.418 --> 11:12.505
Erasing anything makes it look like
we're destroying evidence.

11:12.588 --> 11:15.633
-It's sensitive family information.
-No, I'm with Cristal on this.

11:15.716 --> 11:18.219
Why should I have to cover up
that she's a homewrecker?

11:19.637 --> 11:21.180
Who's to say she didn't kill him?

11:21.263 --> 11:24.225
Fallon, you had someone spying on him
two days before his death.

11:24.308 --> 11:27.269
Plus they think someone rigged
the truck to cause the explosion,

11:27.353 --> 11:29.480
and you had access to the vehicles.

11:29.563 --> 11:32.316
-And what motive?
-To tank the value of the wind farm

11:32.400 --> 11:34.652
so you and Jeff could buy it
out from under Dad

11:34.735 --> 11:37.780
as revenge for him promoting Cristal
to COO instead of you.

11:39.073 --> 11:40.157
That's fair.

11:40.866 --> 11:43.702
Whoever you got to take that photo,
I don't wanna know.

11:44.370 --> 11:45.538
Just erase your tracks.

11:45.621 --> 11:48.499
We need to eliminate any traces of Matthew

11:48.582 --> 11:50.835
beyond his employment
at Carrington Atlantic.

11:50.918 --> 11:54.213
What you saw last night, that is
the downside of being a Carrington.

11:54.880 --> 11:59.844
The upside... is that we'll go to the ends
of the earth to protect each other.

12:02.430 --> 12:04.056
'Cause you can only trust family.

13:08.746 --> 13:11.749

Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

[Cristal] No, I can't take your sweater.

-[Matthew] Are you kidding me?
-[Cristal] You're so sweet.

13:16.962 --> 13:18.047
I'm Matthew.

13:18.130 --> 13:19.256

-Okay.

13:34.146 --> 13:35.189
Good to know.

13:36.357 --> 13:39.401
-What are you doing here?
-Blake felt you should have some support

13:39.485 --> 13:40.778
during this delicate task.

13:40.861 --> 13:42.863
Support or enforcement?

13:42.947 --> 13:45.950
Anything that needs to be removed,
I can take it off your hands.

13:46.033 --> 13:48.285
You're not good
at covering your own tracks.

13:48.369 --> 13:51.080
If you have something to say to me,
you should just say it,

13:51.163 --> 13:53.290
'cause I'm starting to think
you're bluffing.

13:54.124 --> 13:56.001
Otherwise, why not tell Blake?

13:56.877 --> 13:58.504
It would break his heart.

13:58.963 --> 14:01.340
And for now,
I think you could be quite good for us.

14:02.550 --> 14:04.385
You spin scandal for a living.

14:04.760 --> 14:08.013
That's a valuable skillset
for a Carrington.

14:11.016 --> 14:12.393
If only you could master it.

14:17.356 --> 14:18.732
[door opens]

14:18.816 --> 14:20.234
[phone vibrates]

14:20.317 --> 14:21.610
[door closes]

14:31.161 --> 14:32.246
[Fallon] Knock, knock.

14:32.496 --> 14:34.290
I need you to do something for me.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.333
Mm. Name the position.

14:36.917 --> 14:38.711
-Business first.
-Mm-hm.

14:39.461 --> 14:42.548
It seems I am stuck
cleaning up Cristal's mess.

14:42.631 --> 14:43.799
What mess?

14:43.883 --> 14:48.220
Well, remember that little photo of her
you sent me the other day? With Matthew?

14:48.304 --> 14:50.222
You mean when you had me follow her.

14:50.848 --> 14:53.726
Well, in light of yesterday's events,

14:54.018 --> 14:57.438
I think it's best that none of us
are caught hanging on to that photo.

14:57.521 --> 14:59.440
My dad is meeting with the police today.

14:59.523 --> 15:01.984
I'm not sure they'll understand
how innocent it is.

15:03.027 --> 15:05.195
-You deleted it, right?
-Of course.

15:05.279 --> 15:07.698
Well, I never doubted you, obviously.

15:07.781 --> 15:09.909
I used a disposable phone

15:10.618 --> 15:11.785
and I trashed it...

15:12.828 --> 15:16.040
right after I sent it
to your encrypted account.

15:17.374 --> 15:18.792
And what did you do with it?

15:20.294 --> 15:23.213
I didn't realize there was gonna
be a murder investigation.

15:23.923 --> 15:27.509
So, I deleted the e-mail,
just... after I sent it to my dad.

15:28.510 --> 15:30.179
You forwarded the e-mail?

15:31.013 --> 15:33.807
-E-mails leave trails, you know that.
-How do I erase it?

15:33.891 --> 15:36.560
I don't know. I'm the driver. Not IT.

15:40.856 --> 15:44.068
-Where are you going?
-IT. I owe you one.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.238
[Willy] Thanks for coming.

15:48.322 --> 15:51.909
-I wasn't even sure you'd remember me.
-Of course I remember you, Willy.

15:52.493 --> 15:53.953
You were Matthew's partner.

15:54.536 --> 15:56.872
-I heard you were with him when...
-Yeah.

15:57.581 --> 16:00.542
I'm, uh... pretty torn up.

16:02.753 --> 16:03.587
You?

16:05.339 --> 16:06.882
I know Matthew cared about you.

16:09.343 --> 16:10.636
Before he died, he, uh...

16:11.887 --> 16:13.389
He called out your name.

16:14.556 --> 16:16.558
I didn't tell Claudia obviously...

16:17.393 --> 16:19.770
but I think Matthew would've
wanted me to tell you.

16:21.230 --> 16:23.107
And to... To warn you.

16:24.233 --> 16:27.236
The family you're cozying up to,
you know they're not like us.

16:27.319 --> 16:31.699
-What? They're just people, Willy.
-We're just people. We play by the rules.

16:34.868 --> 16:36.870
Carringtons? Especially Blake?

16:40.582 --> 16:42.543
The day before Matthew was killed...

16:43.460 --> 16:46.588
Blake tried to transfer him
to this post in China.

16:47.506 --> 16:50.009
Matthew was sure
that Blake found out about you two

16:50.092 --> 16:51.760
and wanted him out of the picture.

16:53.220 --> 16:55.472
He turned down the offer,
gave Blake his notice,

16:55.556 --> 16:58.058
and that-- That's when things got heated.

16:58.142 --> 17:00.894
Blake's used to getting what he wants.
He comes off strong--

17:00.978 --> 17:03.105
You've known him how long? Four months?

17:05.148 --> 17:06.942
Matthew knew him 18 years.

17:08.777 --> 17:11.030
Long enough to know
where the bodies are buried.

17:12.071 --> 17:14.992
Willy, are you accusing my husband
of killing Matthew?

17:15.576 --> 17:17.118
I wouldn't put it past him.

17:19.121 --> 17:20.497
And neither should you.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.835
I don't know why someone would do this.

17:25.252 --> 17:28.213
Matthew's been a member of the CA family
for nearly two decades.

17:28.797 --> 17:30.591
What if it wasn't him they were after?

17:30.674 --> 17:32.968
Can you think of anyone
who'd have a grudge?

17:34.386 --> 17:36.638
-[Blake] Against Matthew?
-[Stansfield] Or the company.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.559
[Blake] I've got a lot of enemies
if I'm doing my job right.

17:41.769 --> 17:44.897
Now that you mention it...
there is someone that comes to mind.

17:46.648 --> 17:47.900
Jeff Colby.

17:50.194 --> 17:52.279
Maybe he did it
to damage CA's reputation.

17:52.362 --> 17:54.698
Maybe he did it
to tank the value of Windbriar

17:54.782 --> 17:56.867
so he could buy it out from underneath me.

17:56.950 --> 18:00.454
Either way, he had access to
CA thumper trucks thanks to my daughter.

18:01.705 --> 18:03.332
All right. I'll talk to him.

18:06.835 --> 18:08.587
I'm just saying, hypothetically,

18:08.670 --> 18:11.548
if someone wanted to make
a little digital something disappear,

18:11.632 --> 18:12.925
how would they do that?

18:13.300 --> 18:15.511
-Like what?
-Like... photos,

18:15.594 --> 18:17.721
e-mail, whatever,
sent from a private server.

18:19.181 --> 18:20.974
I guess I need more details.

18:21.517 --> 18:24.436
How big are the files?
How nosy are the people looking for it?

18:24.520 --> 18:25.854
Doesn't matter.

18:25.938 --> 18:28.607
Seems to me it does
or else you'd be saying more.

18:29.566 --> 18:31.193
What, don't you trust me?

18:31.944 --> 18:34.863
Oh. It's Stansfield, my dad's pocket cop.

18:35.781 --> 18:39.701
Miss Carrington, Mr. Colby.
Your father told me you were here.

18:39.785 --> 18:41.411
Should I get us a private room?

18:41.745 --> 18:45.249
I'm here to speak to Mr. Colby... alone.

19:16.238 --> 19:17.656
[Blake] Company Christmas present.

19:18.782 --> 19:23.620
About... six years ago, I think.
A little sporty for my taste.

19:23.871 --> 19:26.248
-I thought you were with Stansfield.
-No, he left.

19:27.374 --> 19:28.584
What are you looking for?

19:29.960 --> 19:33.172
Those cuff links I gave you.
I was gonna let Sammy Jo borrow them.

19:33.255 --> 19:35.716
I didn't realize
tank tops required cuff links.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.638
Matthew had that same watch.

19:43.473 --> 19:45.142
Is that why you recognized it?

19:46.351 --> 19:49.313
-I'm sorry, I should've asked you.
-No. No apology necessary.

19:50.689 --> 19:53.275
Everything mine is yours, always.

19:57.487 --> 19:59.448
I have to go see Claudia Blaisdel.

19:59.531 --> 20:03.410
She's spouting lies about some
hostile confrontation I had with Matthew.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.747
-What do you mean, hostile?
-Who knows? It didn't happen.

20:07.247 --> 20:10.250
I just wanna make it clear to her
that we are not the enemy.

20:11.460 --> 20:12.544
I'm coming with you.

20:14.296 --> 20:15.130
All right.

20:18.258 --> 20:20.969

20:22.471 --> 20:24.389

20:29.353 --> 20:30.229
Hey there.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.815
I was gonna do some laps.

20:34.441 --> 20:35.484
Like minds?

20:37.152 --> 20:39.279
-Can I ask you something?
-Yeah.

20:40.948 --> 20:44.576
The day of the wedding, you said Cristal
was the black sheep of your family.

20:45.535 --> 20:46.745
What'd you mean exactly?

20:47.829 --> 20:51.583
Just that... no one in our family
moves more than a mile away...

20:52.542 --> 20:54.169
much less to another country.

20:54.503 --> 20:57.506
I didn't mean to throw shade on her. Okay?

20:57.589 --> 20:59.967
Last thing I need
is for her to kick me out of here.

21:01.551 --> 21:03.178
How long are you staying?

21:05.722 --> 21:07.849
I'm still figuring out my long-term goals.

21:08.392 --> 21:11.353
Short term... I'm thinking hot tub.

21:12.896 --> 21:13.939
Wanna join?

21:14.439 --> 21:16.191
I was thinking we should press pause.

21:16.984 --> 21:19.278
Your aunt, my dad.
We're practically family.

21:19.861 --> 21:21.196
Yeah, we were friends first.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.615
And what's a little incest
between friends?

21:24.199 --> 21:25.409
[both chuckle]

21:26.910 --> 21:31.039
It's funny in Spanish.
But fine. Whatever you want.

21:32.708 --> 21:35.335
If you wanna borrow a swimsuit next time,
you can ask me.

21:48.015 --> 21:49.016
[Blake] Are you ready?

21:49.391 --> 21:50.267
[knocking on door]

21:57.774 --> 22:01.653
Claudia, we're sorry to disturb you.
We were hoping we could talk.

22:03.822 --> 22:05.824
Sure, Carrington. Let's talk.

22:10.037 --> 22:12.789
[Blake]  Carrington Atlantic is doing
everything we can to cooperate.

22:13.749 --> 22:16.335
The police are gonna find
who did this to your husband.

22:16.752 --> 22:19.338
Tell them to look no further.
He's right across from me.

22:20.297 --> 22:21.298
Why are you here?

22:23.008 --> 22:27.220
My lawyers would ask the same question.
They advised me to keep my distance,

22:27.304 --> 22:29.306
but I couldn't do that to Matthew.

22:30.640 --> 22:32.517
-I couldn't let you be alone.
-She's not.

22:33.602 --> 22:35.228
[Blake] It is good of you to be here.

22:35.854 --> 22:40.067
And I want you to know you can take
as much time off work as you need.

22:40.650 --> 22:42.235
Now, let me cut to the chase.

22:43.361 --> 22:45.739
Carrington Atlantic wants to help
in any way we can.

22:46.448 --> 22:49.201
Along with keeping you
on the company healthcare plan...

22:50.744 --> 22:54.664
we would like to pay for Matthew's funeral
and host the wake.

22:56.291 --> 22:58.543
We just don't want you
to worry about anything.

23:04.299 --> 23:06.093
Filthy rich and squeaky clean.

23:06.885 --> 23:08.887
That's what Matthew used to say about you.

23:09.971 --> 23:11.681
You pay people to keep them quiet.

23:12.891 --> 23:18.396
This is what I promised Matthew
if he agreed to relocate to China.

23:20.148 --> 23:22.692
It seems only right that I give it to you.

23:25.195 --> 23:26.113
[exhales]

23:27.280 --> 23:29.533
I don't remember him mentioning China.

23:29.616 --> 23:32.619
-I wasn't aware that he had accepted.
-No, he didn't.

23:32.702 --> 23:35.956
No, he said that money
didn't matter to him.

23:38.041 --> 23:42.003
Not when it meant risking a life that
he'd built and losing the woman he loved.

23:50.303 --> 23:52.305
He kept some things in the office.

23:53.515 --> 23:56.017
I'm sure they have sentimental value
to both of you.

24:02.149 --> 24:03.150
[chuckles]

24:16.580 --> 24:17.622
Still smells like him.

24:21.918 --> 24:24.504
How could you give her those things?
My things.

24:25.130 --> 24:27.132
Do you have any idea
how that made me feel?

24:27.799 --> 24:28.633
Heartbroken?

24:29.551 --> 24:33.054
Manipulated? Disgusted? That's how I felt
when I saw what you held on to.

24:33.513 --> 24:36.808
I gave everything to Anders when
you said it could threaten the family.

24:36.892 --> 24:38.351
I did everything you asked.

24:38.435 --> 24:41.605
I didn't want the police to find
Matthew's things in our possession.

24:41.688 --> 24:44.441
-I was protecting you.
-Is that why you didn't tell the cops

24:44.524 --> 24:47.819
that you threatened to send Matthew
to China? To protect me?

24:47.903 --> 24:49.362
Who told you I threatened him?

24:50.405 --> 24:51.406
I just know you.

24:52.407 --> 24:53.450
Well, if you knew me,

24:53.533 --> 24:56.620
you wouldn't question my intentions,
because everything I do,

24:56.703 --> 24:57.954
I do for you and my family.

25:00.373 --> 25:02.334
Yet every time tears well up in your eyes,

25:02.417 --> 25:05.295
I can't tell if you're mourning Matthew
or that you married me.

25:16.723 --> 25:18.475
[phone vibrates]

25:19.935 --> 25:21.186
I've been trying to call you.

25:21.269 --> 25:23.271
Finally finished up with that cop.

25:23.855 --> 25:27.317
Apparently, Blake sold him
on this whole  CSI Atlanta  episode

25:27.400 --> 25:30.612
about me orchestrating the explosion
to strike a better deal.

25:30.695 --> 25:33.281
I orchestrated the deal.
Not that it's about credit.

25:33.365 --> 25:37.118
This isn't a joke, Fallon.
It's a homicide investigation.

25:37.202 --> 25:38.870
Prather, the guy who owns Windbriar,

25:38.954 --> 25:41.414
got a call from Stansfield
saying I was a suspect.

25:41.498 --> 25:43.917
Now he's pressing pause
on the entire deal.

25:45.377 --> 25:46.628
Blake's screwing us.

25:47.045 --> 25:49.589
I can't believe your own father
would do this to you.

25:49.673 --> 25:51.883
Look, I'm sorry. We'll fix it, okay?

25:53.843 --> 25:56.721
-You were questioned by the cops?
-It's no big deal.

25:56.805 --> 25:59.557
Cops are always a big deal
when mixed with Carringtons.

25:59.641 --> 26:01.810
It's fine, okay? Fallon's on my side.

26:01.893 --> 26:05.981
Is she? Because as long as I've known her,
the only side Fallon Carrington's been on

26:06.064 --> 26:07.232
is Fallon Carrington's.

26:08.733 --> 26:12.821
Wherever this obsession you have with
Fallon comes from, it's a little cliché.

26:14.114 --> 26:16.366
Recent billionaire brother
chasing a white chick?

26:17.158 --> 26:18.368
It's not like that.

26:18.451 --> 26:20.412
Whatever it is, it's dangerous.

26:20.829 --> 26:21.830
[Jeff] Don't you trust her?

26:21.913 --> 26:25.292
I don't have to.
I'm not in business or in bed with her.

26:25.375 --> 26:27.460
Hey, it's a crazy line tonight.

-I take it we're even.

26:43.768 --> 26:47.272
Don't ever let it be said the Carringtons
don't pay their debts in full.

26:47.355 --> 26:49.858
I think I might actually owe you now.

26:50.900 --> 26:51.735
Later.

26:52.235 --> 26:54.779
I may soon be unemployed
with nothing else to do.

26:56.031 --> 26:57.741
My father sent the cops after Jeff,

26:57.824 --> 27:00.410
which left a major wrinkle
in our negotiations.

27:00.952 --> 27:04.331
Have you ever considered
maybe your dad is right about Colby?

27:04.414 --> 27:05.915
[scoffs] No.

27:06.291 --> 27:09.294
My dad's a terrible judge of character.
Look at Cristal.

27:09.377 --> 27:10.795
She's got some nice qualities.

27:10.879 --> 27:13.590
So does a cocker spaniel, but I wouldn't
want my father to marry one.

27:13.673 --> 27:14.507
[chuckles]

27:16.259 --> 27:17.886
Shouldn't you be getting out there?

27:20.555 --> 27:21.556
[Fallon] Eh...

27:21.639 --> 27:22.932
I barely knew the guy.

27:32.567 --> 27:36.946
[priest] We will not all sleep,
but we will all be changed in an instant.

27:37.697 --> 27:39.032
In the twinkling of an eye,

27:39.574 --> 27:42.535
at the last trumpet
for the trumpet will sound,

27:42.827 --> 27:49.125
the dead will be raised imperishable,
and we will be changed.

27:49.626 --> 27:52.337
Matthew Blaisdel enjoyed
the simplicities of life,

27:52.420 --> 27:55.298
but he was by no means a simple man.

27:55.382 --> 27:56.841
He was a man of passion.

27:56.925 --> 27:59.761
♪ Leave in the morning
With everything you wanted ♪

27:59.844 --> 28:01.763
[Cristal]  You didn't think to tell me
you were married?

28:01.846 --> 28:04.224
[Matthew]  I didn't tell you
because I'm leaving her.

28:04.307 --> 28:06.142
Why would you lie to me?

28:06.935 --> 28:08.353
My life's complicated.

28:08.895 --> 28:11.064
Lying is-- Lying is easy.

28:12.357 --> 28:15.068
You just spit it out
and kick sand over it.

28:19.197 --> 28:23.451
[priest] Matthew Blaisdel was one of those
whose life was taken too early,

28:23.785 --> 28:26.621
and yet we stand here
in the same spirit of love.

28:27.497 --> 28:30.667
Ones who leave a legacy
with stories to tell.

28:31.418 --> 28:33.378
Ones so extraordinary that heaven

28:33.670 --> 28:38.299
feels as if it needs to summon
them home even before we expect it.

28:38.883 --> 28:40.176
[sobbing]

28:40.260 --> 28:41.261
Oh.

28:41.845 --> 28:43.388
There's the grieving widow.

28:44.973 --> 28:46.474
I came to pay my respects.

28:49.728 --> 28:52.313
You know you're not the star
of this Lifetime movie?

28:53.606 --> 28:56.151
-The role belongs to his actual wife.
-Back off.

28:56.234 --> 28:59.904
With her condition, think we'll have to
remind her every day that Matthew died?

28:59.988 --> 29:03.324
Maybe it's best we don't so she can
forget about her pathetic husband.

29:03.408 --> 29:04.451
He was a good man.

29:04.534 --> 29:08.288
We both know it's easy to confuse good
with good in bed.

29:10.206 --> 29:11.875
You're so sheltered, Fallon.

29:12.959 --> 29:15.336
You have no idea what life's really like.

29:16.254 --> 29:18.798
How hard it is
to be stuck in a loveless marriage.

29:18.882 --> 29:21.634
Even before Claudia's accident,
they weren't a happy couple.

29:24.721 --> 29:26.473
That must've been really hard...

29:27.390 --> 29:30.560
when you learned that he chose
brain damage over damaged goods.

29:33.146 --> 29:34.647
I get now why you were crying.

29:41.613 --> 29:42.614
[Fallon gasps]

29:43.740 --> 29:44.699
You bitch!

29:44.908 --> 29:46.493
You're gonna wish you buried me!

30:05.053 --> 30:05.970
[Blake] Welcome.

30:10.266 --> 30:11.601
Uh, these are...

30:12.060 --> 30:12.977
[woman] Cristal?

30:14.103 --> 30:16.606
Marla? I didn't know you knew Matthew.

30:17.440 --> 30:20.026
-Did the magazine ask you to come?
-Blake did.

30:23.154 --> 30:25.740
Fallon really is her mother's daughter,
isn't she?

30:31.621 --> 30:33.331
-[Blake] What are you wearing?
-A bold choice.

30:33.414 --> 30:35.667
-I didn't die.
-No, but Cristal might kill you.

30:35.750 --> 30:37.961
Oh, she tried.
Why do you think I had to change?

30:38.920 --> 30:41.714
Looks like your new bride
missed your "protect family" memo,

30:41.798 --> 30:44.467
-but apparently so did you.
-What are you talking about?

30:44.551 --> 30:48.304
While I was trying to delete that photo
to protect her, you sic the cops on Jeff?

30:48.388 --> 30:49.389
Colby isn't family.

30:49.472 --> 30:52.934
Neither was she until two minutes ago,
now we're in a murder investigation.

30:53.017 --> 30:56.020
-[Steven] How is that her fault?
-Everything's her fault. Get on board.

30:57.105 --> 30:59.357
You're pissed
Jeff and I went after Windbriar.

30:59.440 --> 31:01.025
It's more than that.

31:01.109 --> 31:04.153
The reason I left the company
is because you didn't believe in me.

31:04.237 --> 31:05.154
You didn't trust me.

31:07.073 --> 31:08.867
If you're trying to teach me a lesson,

31:08.950 --> 31:11.619
all I learned is that
I never should've trusted you.

31:15.290 --> 31:17.542
We need to get you on that honeymoon.

31:17.625 --> 31:20.253
Yeah. This is a long ways away
from French Polynesia.

31:20.336 --> 31:22.255
Well, you should be free to go soon.

31:22.338 --> 31:25.675
Team up in Floyd County
are honing in on a new suspect,

31:25.758 --> 31:28.720
a third party unaffiliated with CA.

31:29.012 --> 31:30.972
I hear the FBI is getting involved.

31:35.768 --> 31:37.061
What are you doing up here?

31:39.564 --> 31:40.940
[Cristal] Just needed some space.

31:41.774 --> 31:42.817
You?

31:42.901 --> 31:45.862
-It's not particularly fun down there.
-Sam, it's a funeral.

31:45.945 --> 31:50.116
I just thought it'd be different with
the Carringtons. More like a "fun-eral."

31:52.076 --> 31:52.952
Nope.

31:53.995 --> 31:55.288
Shouldn't you be with Blake?

31:57.123 --> 31:58.917
He has plenty of company.

32:00.293 --> 32:04.464
He turned this whole thing into a PR event
to control the narrative.

32:05.089 --> 32:07.258
The lengths he'll go to
and the lies he'll tell

32:07.342 --> 32:08.801
to protect his own family...

32:09.802 --> 32:12.096
it's like the rest of the world
doesn't matter.

32:13.014 --> 32:14.724
Isn't that why you love him?

32:16.017 --> 32:17.185
You have a lot in common.

32:17.268 --> 32:19.729
You've done questionable things
for family, too.

32:20.813 --> 32:21.940
Crossed lines for them.

32:22.857 --> 32:24.442
-That's different.
-Is it?

32:26.569 --> 32:30.198
All I know is that I was very lucky
to have you on my side growing up.

32:31.407 --> 32:33.618
And this family is very lucky
to have you now.

32:44.796 --> 32:45.630
Wow.

32:46.464 --> 32:47.590
This wake is lit.

32:48.257 --> 32:49.968
Oh, it's definitely not.

32:50.468 --> 32:53.596
And if you're here to confront my dad,
it's the worst possible time.

32:53.680 --> 32:57.684
-So, clearly, I'm all for it.
-This isn't about him. It's about you.

32:59.352 --> 33:02.230
I understand you have trust issues.

33:02.313 --> 33:04.691
With a family like yours,
I'm not surprised.

33:04.774 --> 33:07.694
I don't have trust issues.
I just know better.

33:07.777 --> 33:11.572
Well, if we're gonna work together...
I need you to know me better.

33:12.281 --> 33:15.368
-[Fallon] What's on here, your sugarpics?
-[scoffs] You wish.

33:15.451 --> 33:19.539
I wrote a virus to wipe whatever file path
you pointed to on your e-mail server.

33:20.039 --> 33:21.749
No one will suspect the missing data.

33:22.792 --> 33:25.003
You're not even gonna ask me
what I'm erasing?

33:26.879 --> 33:30.341
I trust you...
even if you don't trust me yet.

33:31.592 --> 33:32.802
Gotta start somewhere.

33:36.097 --> 33:37.640
Want me to show you how it works?

33:39.392 --> 33:41.144
[guests chattering]

33:51.696 --> 33:52.989
Who are all these people?

33:53.865 --> 33:55.783
Because they're not friends of Matthew's.

33:56.826 --> 33:58.703
You trying to honor the dead
or yourself?

33:58.786 --> 34:01.456
You've had too much to drink.
Let's get you some water.

34:01.539 --> 34:02.373
Water?

34:03.207 --> 34:05.168
That's what you're offering to shut me up?

34:05.585 --> 34:08.004
What happened,
you exhaust all your funds on Claudia?

34:08.087 --> 34:10.422
-That's enough.
-You really are a great salesman...

34:10.882 --> 34:11.716
Carrington.

34:12.632 --> 34:16.179
You told Claudia what she wanted to hear
and she fell for it.

34:16.262 --> 34:17.847
Willy, don't do this.

34:18.598 --> 34:21.601
You said Matthew didn't wanna move
because of the woman he loved.

34:22.310 --> 34:23.143
Is that not true?

34:24.562 --> 34:26.397
I think we all know who that woman was.

34:27.607 --> 34:30.318
-Let's call you a cab, Willy.
-Well, speak of the devil.

34:32.402 --> 34:35.114
I can't say that I'm surprised
to know where you stand.

34:37.199 --> 34:39.452
You really slept your way to the top,
didn't you?

34:42.580 --> 34:44.290
You wanna know the truth, Willy?

34:45.166 --> 34:47.502
-Matthew was in love with me.
-What are you doing?

34:47.585 --> 34:51.172
But I'm sure he was too proud to tell you
that it was completely one-sided.

34:52.130 --> 34:55.301
How can you say that about him
at his own funeral?

34:56.511 --> 34:57.970
The truth's not hard to say.

34:58.513 --> 35:00.473
You just spit it out
and kick sand over it.

35:02.058 --> 35:04.560
You ride along
on the Carringtons' coattails,

35:04.644 --> 35:07.146
somehow thinking you're morally superior,

35:07.230 --> 35:11.275
when really you're just a pathetic drunk
who loves to trash the boss,

35:11.359 --> 35:13.778
but lacks the nerve to actually quit.

35:14.570 --> 35:16.739
So, let me give you a push, Willy.

35:19.283 --> 35:22.703
As the new COO... you're fired.

35:24.413 --> 35:25.665
[chuckles]

35:27.708 --> 35:28.709
I was wrong about you.

35:31.462 --> 35:33.631
-You are one of them.
-Get out of my house.

35:48.020 --> 35:49.313
What's going on?

35:53.901 --> 35:56.237
-Are you okay?
-No, I'm not okay.

35:59.407 --> 36:01.826
Do you have any idea
how hard that was for me?

36:02.660 --> 36:03.911
How hard any of this is?

36:06.831 --> 36:09.167
Willy was Matthew's friend,
and I lied to him.

36:10.501 --> 36:11.794
Why did you?

36:12.336 --> 36:16.382
To protect this family. To protect you.

36:17.550 --> 36:20.052
The press you invited here
to sell your story...

36:21.053 --> 36:23.806
now they're gonna write about
how Willy got drunk and fired,

36:24.473 --> 36:27.602
and not how you threatened Matthew's life
because I slept with him.

36:27.685 --> 36:30.146
Like I said, I didn't threaten Matthew.

36:33.107 --> 36:35.234
I just told him
I was never letting you go.

36:37.320 --> 36:38.196
And why would I?

36:43.326 --> 36:47.747
I know how hard it is
to be part of my family and my life.

36:51.083 --> 36:52.960
But I can't imagine it without you.

36:55.213 --> 36:57.089
It's my life, too, now.

37:28.329 --> 37:30.331
[piano playing funeral march]

37:39.757 --> 37:42.134
A little on the nose, isn't it?

37:45.179 --> 37:47.348
-Do you play?
-I'm more of a synths kind of guy.

37:47.431 --> 37:49.517
-You play synths?
-No.

37:50.559 --> 37:53.145
I'll leave you to it,
assuming we're still on a break.

37:55.022 --> 37:55.940
We are.

37:56.023 --> 37:57.900
[plays chord]

38:01.237 --> 38:03.072
I'm not the guy you think I am.

38:05.950 --> 38:10.830
Ever since I met you in that bar,
I... gave you the wrong impression.

38:12.915 --> 38:17.461
I came across as some...
sex-addled sexaholic.

38:17.545 --> 38:20.840
You are literally
the most buttoned-up person I know.

38:20.923 --> 38:21.924
See, that's my point.

38:23.426 --> 38:24.343
You don't know me.

38:25.261 --> 38:27.346
You had no idea I was a Carrington...

38:28.347 --> 38:30.391
trying to escape being a Carrington.

38:31.517 --> 38:32.643
Actually...

38:34.520 --> 38:35.396
I did.

38:36.439 --> 38:38.399
And as long as we're telling the truth...

38:40.109 --> 38:43.279
I didn't just run into you
the day before the wedding.

38:45.364 --> 38:46.198
I targeted you.

38:48.534 --> 38:51.078
I know I said Cristal
is the black sheep of our family,

38:51.162 --> 38:53.164
but actually we both are,
and I thought that

38:53.789 --> 38:56.667
if I showed up here uninvited,
she would kick me out.

38:56.751 --> 38:59.587
So, you used me for your foot in the door.

39:03.215 --> 39:04.133
I'm glad it worked.

39:06.302 --> 39:07.261
Honestly?

39:08.888 --> 39:10.431
I didn't know if it was going to.

39:11.891 --> 39:12.892
Wait.

39:13.684 --> 39:14.852
You knew?

39:15.644 --> 39:17.313
It was a pretty big coincidence.

39:19.315 --> 39:20.441
So, we're cool?

39:21.359 --> 39:22.234
You're not mad?

39:22.318 --> 39:25.613
Any idea how many people use me
for my name and don't confess to it?

39:25.696 --> 39:28.074
What about it being too complicated?

39:28.157 --> 39:31.202
Well, in case you haven't noticed...

39:33.746 --> 39:36.207
this family thrives on complicated.

39:48.928 --> 39:50.429
How will you sign the guestbook?

39:52.223 --> 39:53.224
So many choices.

39:54.183 --> 39:55.101
"Miss Flores"?

39:55.851 --> 39:56.977
"Mrs. Carrington"?

39:58.854 --> 40:01.524
Or did he know you best
as "Miss Celia Machado"?

40:04.860 --> 40:05.861
But what's in a name?

40:12.993 --> 40:15.162
Did you know Colby's car
was parked outside?

40:16.330 --> 40:17.748
Tony said he saw him come in.

40:21.961 --> 40:24.797
-What the hell is he doing here?
-Helping me solve a problem.

40:24.880 --> 40:26.465
In fact, he's helping you, too.

40:27.383 --> 40:28.884
Call if you have issues, Fallon.

40:30.719 --> 40:31.595
What is that?

40:32.304 --> 40:34.682
He gave it to me
to erase our digital tracks.

40:35.266 --> 40:37.852
I didn't tell him anything.
I didn't have to.

40:37.935 --> 40:41.230
Turns out there are people who don't
operate from a place of distrust.

40:41.313 --> 40:43.315
He's the one that can't be trusted.

40:43.899 --> 40:46.694
-Tell me you didn't--
-Put his stick in? Relax, Daddy.

40:46.777 --> 40:48.195
We didn't run it yet.

40:48.779 --> 40:50.030
But this is perfect.

40:50.114 --> 40:53.409
You can run it yourself,
after you call Stansfield

40:53.492 --> 40:56.370
and explain to him why you mistakenly
sent the cops after Jeff.

40:57.872 --> 40:59.832
I know you hate to admit
when you're wrong,

40:59.915 --> 41:02.126
but I think you should start
getting used to it.

41:02.626 --> 41:03.669
Excuse me.

41:04.253 --> 41:05.963
We have a situation.

41:12.261 --> 41:13.721
How can we be of help?

41:13.804 --> 41:15.264
We're here for Mr. Carrington.

41:21.896 --> 41:23.981
You have the right to remain silent.

41:24.064 --> 41:27.193
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

41:27.276 --> 41:30.446
You have the right to an attorney.
If you can't afford an attorney...

41:30.529 --> 41:32.781
-[Fallon] Steven.
-...one will be provided for you.

41:33.616 --> 41:37.620
You can exercise any of these rights
