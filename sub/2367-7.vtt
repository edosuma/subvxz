WEBVTT

00:13.681 --> 00:15.223
[door slamming]

00:54.221 --> 00:55.723
[elevator dinging]

00:57.224 --> 00:58.516
[dinging continues]

01:11.614 --> 01:12.990
[yelling]

01:24.417 --> 01:26.211
[man speaking Japanese]
Where is it?

01:26.795 --> 01:27.838
I don't know.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.590
Where is the Black Sky?

01:33.551 --> 01:34.970
[screaming]

01:36.554 --> 01:40.643
You have three limbs left.

01:40.726 --> 01:43.520
And other appendages no man wants to lose.

01:44.604 --> 01:47.440
Where is the Black Sky?

01:47.524 --> 01:49.026
It's gone.

01:50.235 --> 01:52.279
They...

01:52.362 --> 01:54.114
They put it on a ship.

01:54.197 --> 01:56.408
[man]
Where's the ship headed?

01:57.034 --> 01:58.869
New York City.

01:59.327 --> 02:00.370
[whimpering]

02:00.453 --> 02:01.622
Swear to it.

02:01.705 --> 02:03.666
Upon my family.

02:07.836 --> 02:12.758
They're better off without you.

02:27.439 --> 02:29.441
[theme music playing]

03:30.961 --> 03:33.588
Devil, my shapely Irish ass.

03:35.465 --> 03:36.884
Guy's a coward.

03:36.967 --> 03:40.428
Would and I wouldn't give for the chance
to rip that corny mask off and...

03:41.679 --> 03:42.931
And what?

03:43.015 --> 03:45.100
Punch him... in the face...

03:45.183 --> 03:48.020
with my... fisticuffs.

03:49.772 --> 03:53.108
I don't know, he seems, uh...
pretty fisticuffy.

03:53.191 --> 03:56.319
Please tell me I don't detect
a hint of admiration for that terrorist.

03:56.403 --> 04:00.448
This is just all speculation.
Nobody knows if he's a terrorist or what.

04:00.532 --> 04:02.534
You're absolutely right.
Terrorists have causes.

04:02.617 --> 04:04.244
They claim responsibility.

04:04.327 --> 04:08.206
Al-Qaeda wanted the world to know
exactly what kind of assholes they were.

04:08.290 --> 04:10.542
This guy? Not a peep.

04:10.625 --> 04:12.044
All terror without the "-ist."

04:12.127 --> 04:14.087
You know what they call that?
Nut job.

04:14.587 --> 04:15.672
-Hmm, maybe.
-[groans]

04:16.089 --> 04:17.715
[wincing]
How's your side?

04:17.800 --> 04:19.885
Downgraded to agony.

04:19.968 --> 04:22.179
All right, what do you think, Matt?

04:22.262 --> 04:25.808
I think Foggy'll be pitching
for the Mets by mid-season.

04:25.891 --> 04:27.309
[chuckling]
I'm being serious.

04:27.392 --> 04:29.352
[chuckles] So am I.
Have you seen their bullpen?

04:29.436 --> 04:32.898
Come on, you telling me
this dickhead blowing up our backyard

04:32.981 --> 04:34.107
doesn't piss you off?

04:34.191 --> 04:35.483
What happened to Hell's Kitchen,

04:35.567 --> 04:39.112
to you and to Elena,
and to all the people that were hurt...

04:39.196 --> 04:40.738
yeah, it pisses me off.

04:40.823 --> 04:42.699
But this man, whoever he is,
whatever his motive,

04:42.783 --> 04:44.785
he shouldn't be tried
and convicted in the press.

04:44.868 --> 04:47.620
We're lawyers, we know
that's not how it's supposed to work.

04:47.704 --> 04:51.041
So, uh, hypothetically,
if this guy got caught...

04:51.124 --> 04:53.751
needed counsel, Nelson and Murdock
would offer to defend him?

04:53.836 --> 04:54.878
[Foggy] Hell no.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.421
It would be his right.

04:57.255 --> 04:59.132
What about my right
to punch him in the melon?

04:59.216 --> 05:01.343
They pulled a piece of glass
out of my side.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.428
Elena needed 12 stitches.

05:03.511 --> 05:05.763
And you want to Perry Mason
the guy responsible?

05:05.848 --> 05:08.266
I wanna make sure the right person
pays for what happened.

05:08.350 --> 05:09.935
The whole thing's moot.

05:10.018 --> 05:12.562
After shooting those cops, police are
probably looking to settle things

05:12.645 --> 05:15.148
the old-fashioned way
if they catch up to him.

05:15.232 --> 05:18.276
Yeah, it's more than likely.

05:18.360 --> 05:22.823
Just a thought, but we may wanna go
a bit peppier at the end of the day.

05:22.906 --> 05:26.118
Leave on a note slightly higher
than deeply depressing.

05:27.035 --> 05:30.080
She's right.
You're bringing us down, Murdock.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.206
[laughing] Me?

05:32.332 --> 05:36.086
-High note! Softball!
-[laughs]

05:36.169 --> 05:37.921
When are we getting
a company team together?

05:38.005 --> 05:40.048
We have three employees.

05:40.966 --> 05:43.218
At least two of them aren't blind.

05:43.301 --> 05:45.387
Naysayers, each and every one of you.

05:45.470 --> 05:46.721
Karen, come on.

05:46.804 --> 05:48.598
Batting practice, you and me,
Chelsea Piers.

05:48.681 --> 05:50.808
-What do you say?
-Um, I...

05:50.893 --> 05:53.145
Or not. Totally cool.

05:53.228 --> 05:55.188
[Karen] No, no, I would, I would.
It's just that I, um...

05:55.272 --> 05:56.899
I have this, uh, thing.

05:56.982 --> 05:59.151
[Foggy] Go, do that thing.

06:00.485 --> 06:01.611
Not a problem.

06:01.694 --> 06:04.822
Okay, so, um...
see you tomorrow.

06:04.907 --> 06:08.368
We'll be here,
ready to high note and stuff.

06:08.451 --> 06:09.452
Good.

06:10.578 --> 06:12.705
[sighs heavily]

06:12.789 --> 06:13.790
[imitates banging sound]

06:14.499 --> 06:15.625
Smooth.

06:15.708 --> 06:18.253
Admittedly, I'm a work in progress.

06:19.671 --> 06:21.631
Did you know she has mace
on her keychain?

06:21.714 --> 06:22.925
Is that a bad thing?

06:23.008 --> 06:24.884
You ever worry about her?

06:24.968 --> 06:28.221
Worry, like,
something she's not telling us?

06:28.305 --> 06:30.307
Everyone has secrets, Foggy.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.976
I don't.
I'd like some.

06:33.060 --> 06:36.980
Your kind...
like with Hottie McBurner-Phone.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.524
I mean, I assume she's hot.
Is she hot?

06:39.607 --> 06:41.026
Oh...

06:41.109 --> 06:42.777
How would I know?

06:42.860 --> 06:44.571
This again.

06:44.654 --> 06:46.281
You always know.

06:46.364 --> 06:47.740
I mean, you guys getting serious?

06:47.824 --> 06:49.952
Should I dust off the tux
I'll need to rent?

06:50.035 --> 06:51.119
[laughs]

06:52.037 --> 06:55.457
No, uh... it didn't work out.

06:55.540 --> 06:56.541
Oh.

06:56.624 --> 06:59.211
I'm... I'm sorry, man.

06:59.294 --> 07:00.753
Yeah, me too.

07:02.214 --> 07:05.508
Hey, look, I'm gonna order in tonight,
get a jump on this tenement case.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.010
You want me to stay?

07:07.094 --> 07:09.012
No, I'll be all right.
Thanks, buddy.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.847
See you in the morning.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.231
Hey, Matt...

07:19.314 --> 07:21.691
her loss, man.
Seriously.

07:27.030 --> 07:28.198
[door opens]

07:28.823 --> 07:29.866
[door closes]

07:29.950 --> 07:31.451
Owlsley, Leland: Financial Advisor...

07:31.534 --> 07:33.786
at the prestigious firm
of Silver & Brent...

07:43.130 --> 07:46.049
The funds have been reallocated
as requested.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.343
All the arrangements
made per your agreement

07:48.426 --> 07:50.887
with the guy we're not supposed to
blah blah blah.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.639
Business may continue?

07:52.722 --> 07:56.893
In the best possible way...
uninterrupted.

07:56.977 --> 08:00.355
So, uh, what are you going to do with it
when it arrives?

08:01.898 --> 08:05.318
What, you think
I'm a doddering pencil pusher

08:05.402 --> 08:10.782
who moves enormous amounts of money
with no clue as to what it's connected to?

08:11.408 --> 08:12.575
[Leland chuckles]

08:12.659 --> 08:14.536
The numbers are like tea leaves.

08:14.619 --> 08:16.829
Nobody reads them like I can.

08:18.290 --> 08:22.252
You're laying out major reserves
to clear the docks...

08:22.335 --> 08:26.506
to make sure the police
don't come within 10 blocks.

08:26.589 --> 08:29.259
More to bribe the comptrollers

08:29.342 --> 08:31.928
to guarantee straight greens.

08:32.012 --> 08:33.805
[Leland chuckles]

08:33.888 --> 08:35.723
Know how much all that costs?

08:35.807 --> 08:36.849
I do.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.686
There is a point to all your words?

08:40.520 --> 08:42.064
Yeah, I got a--

08:44.191 --> 08:45.400
[Leland clears throat]

08:46.484 --> 08:49.112
What happened to the Russians...

08:49.196 --> 08:52.157
We need to be careful, all of us.

08:52.240 --> 08:56.203
I look out for you... you look out for me.

08:56.286 --> 08:57.537
All I'm saying.

09:00.415 --> 09:04.001
Each man must stand... for himself...

09:04.086 --> 09:06.629
or fall with the unworthy.

09:07.630 --> 09:09.591
What the hell does that mean?

09:11.426 --> 09:12.677
[car engine starting]

09:18.933 --> 09:20.102
Prick.

09:22.812 --> 09:23.980
[car door unlocking]

09:27.024 --> 09:28.318
Oh, God!

09:28.401 --> 09:30.528
What do you want?
My wallet?

09:30.612 --> 09:33.781
You know what I want.
Tell me about the man you work for.

09:33.865 --> 09:37.577
[exhales]
I work for Silver & Brent.

09:38.745 --> 09:40.622
I'm gonna ask you again.

09:41.748 --> 09:44.084
Think about your answer.

09:46.253 --> 09:47.670
Who do you work for?

09:47.754 --> 09:50.465
I told you, I work for Silver and--

09:54.094 --> 09:55.637
You work for Wilson Fisk...

09:55.720 --> 09:58.431
moving his money around.

09:58.515 --> 10:01.601
Which means you have records,
proof of who--

10:02.185 --> 10:03.603
[cane tapping]

10:06.439 --> 10:07.690
-[buzzing]
-[groans]

10:09.192 --> 10:10.902
[Leland] Asshole.

10:12.654 --> 10:13.946
[groaning]

10:14.030 --> 10:15.698
[car engine starts]

10:19.369 --> 10:20.870
[cane tapping]

10:21.704 --> 10:23.540
[groans]

10:34.801 --> 10:37.429
You just gonna lie there all night?

10:39.806 --> 10:41.849
[overlapping voices and sounds]

10:50.733 --> 10:51.984
He's getting worse.

10:52.068 --> 10:57.031
When we first took him in,
Matthew's problems seemed less severe.

10:57.114 --> 10:59.451
Now he's in so much pain.

10:59.534 --> 11:05.122
Doctors, clergy, no one has any idea
what's wrong with him.

11:05.207 --> 11:08.251
We heard about your work
with special children

11:08.335 --> 11:10.378
and thought maybe you could help.

11:10.462 --> 11:11.921
Not for free.

11:13.005 --> 11:15.883
His father left a sizeable inheritance.

11:15.967 --> 11:18.177
What about the mother?
Is she dead?

11:18.261 --> 11:20.137
No, she's--

11:20.222 --> 11:23.266
Well, that's another story.
Here we are.

11:26.436 --> 11:29.939
Make the check out to cash.
I'll take it from here.

11:31.733 --> 11:33.485
[Matt panting]

11:39.907 --> 11:42.201
They think you're getting worse.

11:43.202 --> 11:46.539
But... you're not, are you, kid?

11:49.041 --> 11:50.377
[keys jingling]

11:51.711 --> 11:53.713
You're getting stronger.

11:53.796 --> 11:56.924
[exhales]
Let's get started.

12:00.803 --> 12:02.389
[Matt]
So what kind of training is this?

12:02.472 --> 12:04.349
You like ice cream?

12:04.432 --> 12:06.058
Yeah.

12:06.142 --> 12:09.979
Then shut up and eat it.
I'll ask the questions.

12:11.481 --> 12:13.483
First thing you gotta understand is

12:13.566 --> 12:17.612
nobody feels sorry for you
and nobody ever will.

12:18.530 --> 12:21.783
'Cause when it comes
to being born lucky...

12:21.866 --> 12:23.868
you won the friggin' lottery.

12:23.951 --> 12:25.036
I did?

12:25.995 --> 12:28.205
What did I say about questions?

12:28.290 --> 12:29.457
"Shut up."

12:30.292 --> 12:31.543
Good.

12:32.585 --> 12:35.713
How old were you when you got blinded?

12:35.797 --> 12:37.674
-Nine.
-Nine?

12:38.675 --> 12:42.637
So you had nine whole years
of looking at movies,

12:42.720 --> 12:46.474
blue skies, up girlies' skirts
that I never had.

12:46.558 --> 12:49.185
I was born blind.

12:49.268 --> 12:51.646
You don't hear me whining about it,
do you?

12:51.729 --> 12:52.772
No.

12:52.855 --> 12:58.277
So, you're nine years old, walking along,
minding your own business

12:58.361 --> 13:00.530
and whammo!

13:00.613 --> 13:04.116
Get hit by a truck,
killed dead on the spot.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.618
I wasn't killed.

13:05.702 --> 13:07.036
You lived?

13:07.119 --> 13:08.788
Praise God, it's a miracle.

13:08.871 --> 13:11.791
So you survive the truck

13:11.874 --> 13:15.294
and get this chemical shit in your eyes.

13:15.378 --> 13:16.421
What next?

13:16.504 --> 13:18.255
I hear things.

13:18.340 --> 13:19.966
What kind of things?

13:20.049 --> 13:21.092
Everything.

13:21.175 --> 13:24.721
Coughs and fights and cats meowing.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.639
Sometimes blocks away.

13:26.723 --> 13:27.765
I can sense things.

13:27.849 --> 13:30.309
I know where things are
and when they move.

13:31.769 --> 13:32.812
But I can't see.

13:32.895 --> 13:36.065
You know what they call stuff like that?

13:36.148 --> 13:37.274
Gifts.

13:37.359 --> 13:39.986
The special kind.

13:40.069 --> 13:43.072
The kind that very few people have.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.324
Or deserve.

13:45.408 --> 13:47.034
I never thought of it that way.

13:47.118 --> 13:49.078
Well, that's because you're stupid.

13:49.161 --> 13:50.705
I'm not stupid, I'm smart.

13:50.788 --> 13:52.289
Because you taught yourself

13:52.374 --> 13:56.085
how to run your little fingers
over the bumps and read Braille?

13:56.168 --> 13:58.755
Smart don't come out of books, kid.

13:58.838 --> 14:03.718
Smart is making the right decision
at the right time.

14:05.011 --> 14:06.929
Like now.

14:07.013 --> 14:09.056
What's it gonna be, Matty?

14:09.140 --> 14:13.645
You gonna spend your life crying
and rocking yourself to sleep at night?

14:13.728 --> 14:16.606
Or are you gonna dig deep

14:16.689 --> 14:21.403
and find out what it takes
to reshuffle those cards life dealt you?

14:22.820 --> 14:24.155
Your call.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.953
[chuckles] Good choice, kid.

14:33.540 --> 14:36.042
No one's bought me ice cream
since my dad died.

14:36.125 --> 14:37.669
What's it taste like?

14:37.752 --> 14:39.712
-Vanilla.
-[man scoffs]

14:39.796 --> 14:42.590
Everybody can taste vanilla.

14:42.674 --> 14:46.469
Pay a little more attention,
use those gifts.

14:46.553 --> 14:48.388
You know what you got?

14:49.472 --> 14:51.974
Sugar grains, vanilla bean,

14:52.058 --> 14:57.063
milk from three different dairies
from two states...

15:00.191 --> 15:01.776
ugh...

15:01.859 --> 15:05.572
batch of chemicals
straight off the periodic tables and...

15:07.865 --> 15:10.577
dirt off the guy's hand
that served it to you.

15:11.744 --> 15:14.706
He spent his morning gardening.

15:14.789 --> 15:18.793
Whole world around you, Matty,
and it is friggin' huge.

15:18.876 --> 15:20.587
And all you need...

15:21.879 --> 15:23.715
are the guts to let it in.

15:23.798 --> 15:25.341
Try.

15:25.425 --> 15:28.761
That dog, what's his story?

15:28.845 --> 15:30.472
[dog panting]

15:30.555 --> 15:32.014
He's hungry...

15:32.098 --> 15:33.558
his stomach's growling...

15:34.476 --> 15:38.438
and he's dying to eat the hot dogs
that guy's carrying just upwind of him.

15:40.314 --> 15:41.899
Not bad.

15:41.983 --> 15:44.276
What about the girl?

15:46.446 --> 15:48.740
Her skin's... Her skin's too hot.

15:51.117 --> 15:53.369
-Her heart's beating fast.
-[indistinct talking]

15:53.453 --> 15:54.746
Is she sick?

15:54.829 --> 15:56.539
Worse.

15:56.623 --> 15:57.999
She's in love.

15:58.082 --> 15:59.584
And the old man?

16:04.547 --> 16:05.798
He's...

16:08.259 --> 16:09.469
He's dying.

16:09.552 --> 16:12.054
And there's nothing you can do about it.

16:13.890 --> 16:18.478
Big world...
not all of it flowers and sunshine.

16:19.353 --> 16:24.734
And the only way
guys like you and me can survive

16:24.817 --> 16:28.613
is to grab it by the throat
and never let go.

16:29.864 --> 16:32.199
[Matt] If I ask you a question,
will you hit me?

16:32.825 --> 16:34.368
Depends on the question.

16:34.451 --> 16:37.539
How did you find me?
How did you know?

16:37.622 --> 16:41.167
Old bitty at the orphanage
thinks it's her idea.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.085
But it wasn't, was it?

16:44.921 --> 16:47.048
Maybe it's one of my gifts.

16:47.131 --> 16:49.466
Or you just got lucky.

16:49.551 --> 16:51.135
[scoffing]
That's not an answer.

16:51.218 --> 16:52.303
[man chuckles]

16:53.805 --> 16:55.848
You catch on quick.

16:58.267 --> 16:59.519
You're going to help me?

17:00.102 --> 17:02.063
No, I'm gonna train you.

17:03.314 --> 17:07.151
How to control your gift,
make it work for you...

17:07.234 --> 17:10.572
use it, and how to fight.

17:10.655 --> 17:12.574
My dad never wanted me to fight.

17:12.657 --> 17:15.827
Your dad ain't here.
You'll need skills for the war.

17:15.910 --> 17:17.244
What war?

17:17.870 --> 17:21.958
We'll get to that part...
when you're ready.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.251
I don't even know your name.
What do I call you?

17:24.335 --> 17:25.837
Stick.

17:25.920 --> 17:29.506
Are you gonna lie there all night
or get up off your ass?

17:30.424 --> 17:31.593
Jesus, kid.

17:31.676 --> 17:34.929
I'm gone five minutes,
you turn this place into a shit show.

17:35.012 --> 17:36.305
[Masked Man]
You've been gone 20 years.

17:37.640 --> 17:38.850
What are you doing back in my city?

17:38.933 --> 17:40.935
Your city?

17:41.018 --> 17:43.270
Hell's Kitchen hates your guts.

17:43.354 --> 17:47.191
They have you pegged as a cop killer
and some kind of mad bomber.

17:47.274 --> 17:48.525
Yeah, I'm taking care of it.

17:48.610 --> 17:50.361
An old guy just lit you up.

17:50.444 --> 17:52.196
You ain't taking care of shit.

17:52.279 --> 17:53.948
Why are you here?

17:54.031 --> 17:55.950
To save you...

17:56.033 --> 17:59.328
and everyone in the Kitchen
from a horrible death.

17:59.411 --> 18:01.038
[scoffs]

18:01.122 --> 18:02.498
More or less.

18:04.416 --> 18:05.668
[Karen sighs]

18:05.752 --> 18:08.462
Paper trail on Union Allied's a bust.

18:08.545 --> 18:10.006
Whoever's pulling the strings

18:10.089 --> 18:12.925
busted up the one big corporation
into a bunch of little ones.

18:13.009 --> 18:14.426
It's an old game.

18:14.510 --> 18:17.471
Spread the records far and wide,
discourage investigation.

18:17.554 --> 18:19.556
[sighs] God. I mean, it's like...

18:19.641 --> 18:22.894
It's like trying to straighten out
a bowl of spaghetti.

18:22.977 --> 18:24.937
Well, you could always let it go.

18:25.855 --> 18:28.315
Not gonna happen.

18:28.399 --> 18:29.734
I already told you that.

18:29.817 --> 18:32.779
Stop complaining.
This is the job.

18:32.862 --> 18:35.531
-Researching, gathering facts.
-[Karen sighs]

18:35.615 --> 18:39.451
It's long and boring and complicated,
and half the time you still come up empty.

18:40.662 --> 18:43.998
Well, you're just
a little ray of sunshine.

18:44.081 --> 18:45.917
Just giving you the lay of the land.

18:47.168 --> 18:51.338
For every exposé I've had published,
there were a dozen that didn't pan out.

18:51.422 --> 18:53.132
All right, all right,
so I'm the new girl on the block,

18:53.215 --> 18:55.134
I don't know what I'm doing, I get it.

18:59.764 --> 19:02.767
What about you?
What'd you find?

19:05.061 --> 19:07.271
Ah, bits and pieces. Yakuza...

19:07.354 --> 19:09.899
Wait, [stuttering] the Japanese mafia?

19:10.900 --> 19:13.527
Triads, too.
Drugs, I think.

19:14.821 --> 19:19.033
Then there's the bombings
that took out the Russians.

19:19.116 --> 19:23.120
And you think
it's all connected to Union Allied?

19:23.204 --> 19:24.580
Doesn't matter what I think.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.498
Only matters what I can prove.

19:26.582 --> 19:30.377
Wait, what about the cops that got shot?

19:30.461 --> 19:33.172
I mean, you really think
that was the guy in the mask?

19:36.133 --> 19:39.636
I was standing right next to one of them
when it happened.

19:41.013 --> 19:43.015
Detective named Blake.

19:44.851 --> 19:47.436
Didn't like each other very much.

19:47.519 --> 19:49.396
Yeah, I met him...

19:49.480 --> 19:51.858
when they brought me into the precinct.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.610
I see why you didn't get along.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.821
Did what I could.

19:56.904 --> 19:59.323
If he comes out of a coma, maybe...

19:59.406 --> 20:03.285
maybe he'll thank me,
tell me what really happened out there.

20:03.369 --> 20:05.287
Till then...

20:05.371 --> 20:07.749
the man in the mask pops up...

20:07.832 --> 20:10.584
do me a favor, run the other way.

20:11.961 --> 20:14.130
He saved my life, Ben.

20:15.256 --> 20:18.050
How do you know
he wasn't there just to, um...

20:18.968 --> 20:20.552
hurt somebody else?

20:22.722 --> 20:26.683
I... I never...
never thought about it like that.

20:26.768 --> 20:31.522
My experience...
there are no heroes, no villains.

20:31.605 --> 20:33.149
Just people with different agendas.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.942
Yeah, and one of those was to kill me.

20:35.026 --> 20:36.277
Mmm-hmm.

20:36.360 --> 20:37.403
It was.

20:37.486 --> 20:40.239
And you're not careful,
maybe they'll want a second crack at it.

20:42.408 --> 20:45.912
The only way I'll ever feel safe again

20:45.995 --> 20:48.915
is if the people that
you are talking about are put away.

20:48.998 --> 20:51.918
Then we better try harder
to straighten out that spaghetti.

20:54.921 --> 20:56.047
So...

20:57.131 --> 20:58.758
if we can connect...

21:00.051 --> 21:03.679
the tenements, and the shootings,
and Union Allied...

21:04.596 --> 21:06.808
that something
you'd take to your editor?

21:06.891 --> 21:08.225
[chuckles]

21:08.309 --> 21:10.144
Yeah.

21:10.227 --> 21:12.271
-Probably bring home a Pulitzer.
-[Karen laughs]

21:12.354 --> 21:14.065
But, uh, I think it's a long shot.

21:14.148 --> 21:18.069
Well, I was a mean three-point shooter
on my high school basketball team.

21:18.152 --> 21:20.279
I like the long shots.

21:20.362 --> 21:22.156
This isn't a game, Karen.

21:22.239 --> 21:24.533
I... I know that.

21:24.616 --> 21:28.620
Anything happens to you...
it's gonna be on me,

21:28.704 --> 21:30.331
and, uh...

21:33.500 --> 21:35.627
I don't want to be responsible for that.

21:37.964 --> 21:39.423
I can't.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.594
I'll be okay.

21:45.221 --> 21:47.473
They're not gonna win.

22:05.282 --> 22:06.993
[engine starts]

22:21.924 --> 22:24.218
[scoffs] What a shithole.

22:25.344 --> 22:27.138
You have any idea what I pay in rent?

22:27.221 --> 22:28.847
Expensive shithole.

22:28.931 --> 22:29.932
[sniffing]

22:30.016 --> 22:31.433
You had a woman in here.

22:31.517 --> 22:32.684
That's none of your business.

22:32.768 --> 22:34.937
When's she coming back?

22:35.812 --> 22:37.481
-Never.
-Good.

22:37.564 --> 22:40.234
You got a warped perspective on the whole
good/bad thing, you know that?

22:40.317 --> 22:41.527
[sighs]

22:41.610 --> 22:43.570
Women are a distraction.

22:44.280 --> 22:48.951
Just like...
furniture, apartments...

22:49.701 --> 22:50.995
Whoa.

22:51.828 --> 22:53.247
[sighs]

22:53.330 --> 22:54.706
Silk sheets.

22:54.790 --> 22:57.043
Cotton feels like sandpaper
on my skin.

22:58.460 --> 23:00.922
You'd be better off
sleeping on real sandpaper

23:01.005 --> 23:03.674
than surrounding yourself
with all this bullshit.

23:03.757 --> 23:06.802
This is my life and
I made something of it, without you.

23:06.885 --> 23:09.013
That's the part that really
pisses you off, isn't it?

23:09.096 --> 23:12.849
No, Matty.
No, I'm proud of you, I really am.

23:12.934 --> 23:16.938
The things you've done,
what you've made of yourself, but...

23:18.064 --> 23:19.273
this is...

23:19.356 --> 23:24.361
Surrounding yourself with soft stuff
isn't life, it's death.

23:25.362 --> 23:28.449
Someday those silk sheets
are gonna crawl up behind you,

23:28.532 --> 23:31.910
wrap themselves around your throat
and choke you to death.

23:31.994 --> 23:33.079
You're a warrior.

23:33.162 --> 23:34.621
Yeah...

23:34.705 --> 23:35.957
that's not all I am.

23:36.040 --> 23:41.003
A warrior, heir to the Spartans,
baddest of the bad-asses.

23:41.087 --> 23:43.089
They knew what they had to do
and they did it.

23:43.172 --> 23:44.215
And what was that?

23:44.298 --> 23:46.758
Cut it loose, all of it.

23:47.676 --> 23:50.096
Cut yourself free...

23:50.179 --> 23:53.432
from the women,
the comforts, the fancy job.

23:53.515 --> 23:55.559
[laughs]
The job's not that fancy.

23:55.642 --> 23:58.312
Do you have friends?
People you care about?

23:58.395 --> 23:59.896
Yeah, two.

23:59.981 --> 24:02.108
Cut 'em loose, for their sake.

24:02.191 --> 24:04.986
Break their hearts if you have to,
just do it quick.

24:05.069 --> 24:06.237
I'm not gonna do that.

24:06.320 --> 24:09.156
Then they will suffer
and you will die.

24:10.532 --> 24:14.120
Relationships are a luxury
men like you and me can't afford.

24:14.203 --> 24:15.621
Is that why you left?

24:17.706 --> 24:19.291
Huh? To protect me?

24:19.375 --> 24:21.043
I had my reasons.

24:21.127 --> 24:22.544
I was a kid.

24:23.754 --> 24:25.214
You still are.

24:26.340 --> 24:28.425
"Boo-hoo. Stick left me.

24:28.509 --> 24:31.762
Think I'll bury my sorrows
between the legs of a supermodel."

24:31.845 --> 24:32.929
Don't push it, Stick.

24:33.014 --> 24:34.931
Or what?

24:35.016 --> 24:37.184
I'm trying to teach you how to stay alive.

24:37.268 --> 24:39.353
Christ, you're worse than your old man.

24:39.436 --> 24:42.023
Born to lose Battlin' Jack.

24:42.106 --> 24:45.109
At least your daddy got paid
when he hit the floor.

24:46.193 --> 24:47.486
[grunting]

24:47.569 --> 24:48.862
You're hurting me.

24:48.945 --> 24:50.989
Make me stop.

24:51.073 --> 24:52.908
-I can't.
-Then quit.

24:52.991 --> 24:54.785
Murdocks never quit.

24:58.914 --> 25:00.041
Then beat me.

25:01.333 --> 25:04.045
[sighs]
I've got all day, kid.

25:05.712 --> 25:07.256
You're just a bully.

25:07.339 --> 25:11.260
World's full of 'em.
What are you gonna do about it?

25:12.761 --> 25:13.762
Feel the breeze.

25:18.309 --> 25:19.976
You got heart, kid.

25:20.894 --> 25:22.396
But heart's not enough.

25:22.479 --> 25:24.731
You've got to control that rage.

25:24.815 --> 25:26.024
You said anger's a weapon.

25:26.108 --> 25:28.569
Anger is a spark, good.

25:28.652 --> 25:34.158
Rage is a wildfire,
out of control, therefore useless.

25:34.241 --> 25:36.285
Just like you laying there.

25:43.209 --> 25:44.543
[gasping]

25:46.462 --> 25:48.547
I thought Murdocks never quit.

25:48.964 --> 25:50.006
[whimpering]

25:50.924 --> 25:53.510
[sobbing] It's my fault! It's my fault!

25:53.594 --> 25:55.096
I did it, I killed him!

25:55.179 --> 25:56.222
Killed who?

25:56.305 --> 25:58.014
My dad.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.519
They paid him to lose against Creel.

26:02.603 --> 26:05.189
But... But I wanted him to win.

26:05.272 --> 26:06.982
So he did because of me.

26:07.065 --> 26:08.817
Because of me.

26:10.652 --> 26:12.613
I just wanted him to come home.

26:12.696 --> 26:14.948
But he didn't,
and he never will.

26:15.031 --> 26:17.659
We all pay for our choices, kid.

26:18.619 --> 26:22.789
Maybe your old man fought for you,
maybe he did it for himself.

26:22.873 --> 26:26.710
The only thing you know for sure
is he's gone now.

26:28.420 --> 26:29.588
But I'm here.

26:30.631 --> 26:32.883
Now, get up.

26:32.966 --> 26:36.303
Time to stop taking a beating
and start giving one.

26:38.054 --> 26:39.848
Get up.

26:42.684 --> 26:43.894
Get up.

26:45.771 --> 26:46.980
Get up!

26:53.737 --> 26:54.988
[chuckles]

26:55.071 --> 26:59.117
Come on, kid.
Show me I'm not wasting my time.

27:07.042 --> 27:08.294
[breathing heavily]

27:08.377 --> 27:09.920
[both grunting]

27:11.922 --> 27:13.215
[Stick laughing]

27:14.300 --> 27:17.303
Took you 20 years
to learn how to get out of that one.

27:18.220 --> 27:19.971
Yeah, I've learned a lot
since you've been gone.

27:20.055 --> 27:21.557
-Like what?
-You're a dick.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.725
That's true.

27:23.809 --> 27:25.060
You got any beer?

27:25.686 --> 27:27.438
[chuckles]
Yeah, in the fridge.

27:29.022 --> 27:30.106
I'll bet...

27:31.442 --> 27:34.695
it's that German piss, isn't it?

27:35.696 --> 27:38.156
So you gonna tell me why you're here?

27:38.240 --> 27:40.951
Or is the suspense supposed to kill me?

27:41.868 --> 27:44.079
-It's the war, Matty.
-[pops cap]

27:48.375 --> 27:49.835
Never-ending war.

27:49.918 --> 27:52.045
With who?
You never got around to that part.

27:52.128 --> 27:55.382
Now, the Japanese, mostly.

27:55.466 --> 27:59.052
Look, I don't want you tearing up
Hell's Kitchen going after the yakuza.

27:59.135 --> 28:00.637
Yakuza? [chuckles]

28:01.597 --> 28:04.433
You don't know what's going on
in your own backyard.

28:04.516 --> 28:07.811
The guy that was yappin'
with that old man you slapped around,

28:07.894 --> 28:09.020
he's pretty high up.

28:09.104 --> 28:12.858
He goes by a lot of names.
Using Nobu this time around.

28:14.025 --> 28:15.151
So, Nobu,

28:15.236 --> 28:17.613
you want him so bad, why'd you
let him get away back in the garage?

28:17.696 --> 28:19.155
[sighs] I don't want him.

28:19.240 --> 28:22.659
I want what's on the ship
he's meeting at the docks tonight.

28:22.743 --> 28:24.870
Right, Owlsley was talking about that.

28:25.912 --> 28:28.290
What's Nobu bringing in?
Drugs or something?

28:28.374 --> 28:30.041
A weapon.

28:30.125 --> 28:32.961
They call it Black Sky,
the bringer of shadows.

28:33.044 --> 28:34.045
What kind of weapon?

28:34.129 --> 28:36.715
The kind you don't want in your world.

28:38.384 --> 28:39.426
Just say it.

28:39.510 --> 28:41.553
-Say what?
-Say that you want my help.

28:41.637 --> 28:44.055
I want you to help yourself.

28:44.139 --> 28:46.725
Nobu and his guys are in tight with Fisk.

28:46.808 --> 28:49.185
You hurt them, you hurt baldy--

28:49.270 --> 28:51.187
-You know about Fisk?
-[Stick scoffs]

28:51.272 --> 28:52.564
I know a lot of shit.

28:52.648 --> 28:55.651
This beer, for example, sucks.

28:55.734 --> 28:59.696
After all your talk
about cutting friends loose, and...

29:00.531 --> 29:01.573
now you need one.

29:01.657 --> 29:05.286
I don't need a friend.
I need a soldier. Committed.

29:05.369 --> 29:08.330
Not some bleeding heart idealist
hanging onto half measures.

29:08.414 --> 29:11.082
You don't know anything
about what I'm doing here.

29:11.166 --> 29:13.877
Kid, in war, people die.

29:13.960 --> 29:16.797
If it's not you, it's the guy next to you.

29:19.090 --> 29:23.345
How many men have you killed
protecting this city?

29:28.016 --> 29:30.436
You're still afraid to cross that line.

29:30.519 --> 29:33.980
Someday, it's gonna come down
to you or the other guy.

29:34.064 --> 29:36.483
If it's not Fisk, somebody else.

29:36.567 --> 29:38.151
What're you gonna do then?

29:38.234 --> 29:41.613
Yeah, a Russian asshole
asked me the same thing recently...

29:41.697 --> 29:43.073
right before he died.

29:43.156 --> 29:45.617
Are you the one
that put him in the ground?

29:46.117 --> 29:47.202
No.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.622
Half measures, Matty.

29:52.207 --> 29:54.167
Ah, screw it.

29:55.544 --> 29:57.879
Ride with me tonight...

29:57.963 --> 30:01.049
help me destroy Black Sky,
keep it off the streets,

30:01.132 --> 30:03.176
and I promise you this...

30:03.259 --> 30:06.972
Wilson Fisk will know the taste of fear
the day he faces you

30:07.055 --> 30:10.601
'cause he'll know that
you kicked the guy he's afraid of

30:10.684 --> 30:12.353
right in the nuts.

30:14.229 --> 30:15.481
What do you say, kid?

30:16.940 --> 30:18.233
One rule...

30:19.192 --> 30:20.486
you don't kill anybody.

30:20.569 --> 30:21.820
[sighs]

30:23.279 --> 30:27.242
I swear I will not kill anybody.

30:30.746 --> 30:31.997
Pussy.

30:37.794 --> 30:38.920
Uh...

30:39.004 --> 30:41.840
[speaking Spanish]
How's your head?

30:41.923 --> 30:43.258
I'm alive.

30:43.342 --> 30:45.218
It's enough.

30:46.345 --> 30:48.555
How much do I owe you for the groceries?

30:48.639 --> 30:52.100
[speaking English] No, no, no, no, no.
Put that away.

30:52.183 --> 30:53.935
[speaking Spanish]
I don't want your money.

30:54.019 --> 30:56.355
No, I don't take charity.

30:56.438 --> 30:58.189
All right.

30:58.273 --> 31:00.859
You can pay me if you want...

31:00.942 --> 31:02.277
with information?

31:02.819 --> 31:04.571
What can I tell you?

31:04.655 --> 31:07.491
A lot, I hope.

31:09.325 --> 31:13.246
I'm working on a legal case...

31:13.329 --> 31:15.248
Oh, yes, yes...

31:15.331 --> 31:17.459
with the handsome lawyer.

31:19.044 --> 31:21.171
[speaking English]
Yeah, um, Matt. [laughs]

31:21.254 --> 31:23.799
[speaking Spanish]
No, Mr. Foggy.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.091
Oh.

31:25.175 --> 31:27.010
[speaking Spanish]
You think Foggy is handsome?

31:27.093 --> 31:28.219
-[Karen laughs]
-[Elena exclaims]

31:28.303 --> 31:31.056
I see the way he looks at you.

31:31.139 --> 31:34.184
Never is a man more good looking

31:34.267 --> 31:36.352
than when he is in love.

31:36.437 --> 31:37.438
[gasps]

31:38.480 --> 31:39.565
[speaking English]
Oh, Christ.

31:40.148 --> 31:41.232
Oh, uh...

31:42.859 --> 31:43.860
[speaking Spanish]
I'm sorry.

31:45.153 --> 31:46.655
[laughs] Um...

31:47.322 --> 31:49.825
[speaking English]
Moving on, um...

31:49.908 --> 31:55.622
[speaking Spanish]
I'm trying to make a connection...

31:56.372 --> 32:00.126
between a construction company

32:00.210 --> 32:05.006
and the repairman
that did this to your apartment.

32:05.090 --> 32:08.719
Why don't you ask Mr. Tully?

32:08.802 --> 32:10.721
He sent them.

32:10.804 --> 32:13.474
I can't find him.

32:13.557 --> 32:18.144
His lawyers say he's on vacation.

32:18.228 --> 32:19.270
[exclaims]

32:19.354 --> 32:21.690
I live like this

32:21.773 --> 32:26.069
and that fat shit is lying on a beach?

32:26.737 --> 32:28.196
Ugh. Oh.

32:28.279 --> 32:29.280
Excuse me.

32:29.364 --> 32:30.741
No, no.

32:30.824 --> 32:32.493
I think...

32:32.576 --> 32:34.870
it's pretty damn appropriate
in this case.

32:37.038 --> 32:41.167
Do you have papers
from the repairs?

32:41.251 --> 32:42.919
Receipts? Anything you had to--

32:43.003 --> 32:44.004
Sign?

32:44.087 --> 32:45.464
No, I'm sorry.

32:45.547 --> 32:49.092
I just called Mr. Tully,
and he sent them over.

32:49.175 --> 32:50.886
Can you tell me what they looked like?

32:50.969 --> 32:52.428
Yes.

32:52.513 --> 32:53.805
One was bald.

32:53.889 --> 32:54.890
[speaking English]
Okay.

32:54.973 --> 32:59.645
[speaking Spanish] And the other
had a big tattoo on his arm.

32:59.728 --> 33:01.772
[speaking English]
A tattoo?

33:01.855 --> 33:02.856
[speaking Spanish]
Of what?

33:04.274 --> 33:05.859
Not a picture.

33:06.860 --> 33:08.529
It was like a...

33:08.612 --> 33:10.196
pattern.

33:10.280 --> 33:12.991
Ugly. Went up to his neck.

33:13.074 --> 33:15.494
Thank God he's no son of mine.

33:15.577 --> 33:17.162
[Karen laughs]

33:17.245 --> 33:18.955
Thank you, Elena.

33:19.039 --> 33:21.166
That might help.

33:23.418 --> 33:26.797
All of this makes me worry.

33:27.548 --> 33:29.299
[speaking English]
No.

33:29.382 --> 33:30.592
No, no, no. Elena...

33:30.676 --> 33:32.010
[speaking Spanish]
They...

33:32.093 --> 33:34.805
They're the ones
that should be worried.

33:36.014 --> 33:37.933
If I can find a connection...

33:38.016 --> 33:41.436
to the men that did this
and the company...

33:41.520 --> 33:43.980
[speaking English] ...then we will have
their dicks in a vice.

33:44.648 --> 33:45.857
Sorry.

33:45.941 --> 33:48.026
[speaking Spanish]
How long have you been like this,

33:48.109 --> 33:49.152
Miss Page?

33:49.903 --> 33:50.946
Um...

33:51.988 --> 33:53.489
Ever since...

33:54.783 --> 33:56.577
I got to New York.

33:56.660 --> 33:57.703
Oh.

33:59.996 --> 34:01.081
Adiós.

34:39.452 --> 34:40.996
[Karen yelping]

34:41.079 --> 34:42.998
So, why you bothering the old woman?

34:43.081 --> 34:44.750
Get off of me!

34:45.291 --> 34:47.586
-Ahh!
-She gonna spray you.

34:47.669 --> 34:50.881
Maybe I take that away from you,
empty the whole thing in your face.

34:50.964 --> 34:53.592
Burn your eyes out so you don't go
snooping where you're not supposed to.

34:53.675 --> 34:54.926
[Karen grunts]
[man groans]

34:55.010 --> 34:56.970
-Ahh!
-Stupid bitch!

34:59.723 --> 35:00.849
[men groaning]

35:03.059 --> 35:06.021
Foggy?
Oh, my God.

35:07.063 --> 35:09.274
[panting]
Wait... what are you doing here?

35:09.357 --> 35:11.026
-What are you doing here?
-What are you doing here?

35:11.109 --> 35:13.069
-What are you doing here?
-Are you following me?

35:13.153 --> 35:14.529
-Yeah.
-[exasperated] Why?

35:14.613 --> 35:17.448
Because you were acting weird.
I was worried about you.

35:18.241 --> 35:19.618
[man screaming]

35:21.077 --> 35:22.663
I can take care of myself.

35:22.746 --> 35:25.290
Let's discuss that
away from the maniacs, okay?

35:25.373 --> 35:27.583
-Come on!
-Oh, shit.

35:28.752 --> 35:30.170
[man groaning]

35:52.525 --> 35:54.277
How many do you read?

35:55.445 --> 35:57.656
I'm picking up a dozen heartbeats.

35:58.281 --> 36:00.951
Slow, steady, not even a flutter.

36:02.368 --> 36:03.870
There's one more.

36:04.788 --> 36:05.997
Stronger...

36:07.540 --> 36:08.541
different.

36:09.084 --> 36:10.460
Nobu.

36:11.377 --> 36:13.964
[Masked Man] They're armed.
MP7s with suppressors.

36:14.380 --> 36:15.757
Huh.

36:15.841 --> 36:17.508
Somebody wants things quiet.

36:17.592 --> 36:19.344
We'll be quieter.

36:22.638 --> 36:24.766
-You remember how to use these?
-I won't need 'em.

36:24.850 --> 36:25.934
Yeah, you will.

36:26.852 --> 36:28.770
Thin out the herd.

36:28.854 --> 36:31.481
-I'll take care of the Black Sky.
-How?

36:31.564 --> 36:34.234
Just do your job, I'll do mine.
Move.

37:32.583 --> 37:34.335
[loud thud]

37:54.355 --> 37:56.983
[heart beating]

38:30.976 --> 38:32.268
-[arrow whistling]
-[boy grunting]

38:32.352 --> 38:33.979
[men shouting in Japanese]

38:37.065 --> 38:38.358
[speaking Japanese]
Kill him!

38:39.359 --> 38:41.069
[men grunting]

38:44.447 --> 38:45.698
Go!

38:56.584 --> 38:57.919
[breathing heavily]

39:02.340 --> 39:03.967
[Stick exclaiming]

39:11.557 --> 39:12.600
[exclaims]

39:12.683 --> 39:13.768
Break.

39:14.519 --> 39:16.021
What rules the body?

39:16.104 --> 39:17.147
My mind.

39:17.230 --> 39:18.564
[grunting]

39:19.399 --> 39:21.359
[Stick]
What's your strongest weapon?

39:21.442 --> 39:22.527
My body.

39:29.910 --> 39:32.245
Connection, mind, body?

39:33.204 --> 39:36.166
The mind controls the body,
the body controls our enemies,

39:36.249 --> 39:39.460
our enemies control jack shit
by the time we're done with them.

39:39.544 --> 39:40.795
Right.

39:44.132 --> 39:46.259
Fighting is just the start.

39:48.719 --> 39:51.890
You have to control your feelings...

39:51.973 --> 39:54.475
your deep down inside feelings.

39:54.559 --> 39:57.062
-How?
-Meditate.

39:57.145 --> 39:59.522
You mean that thing
where you pretend not to sleep?

39:59.605 --> 40:01.191
[chuckling]

40:01.274 --> 40:03.944
Yeah. Yeah, that one.

40:05.236 --> 40:08.739
Open yourself up to it...
learn it,

40:08.823 --> 40:12.035
make you way stronger,
more focused.

40:12.953 --> 40:15.246
Even heal your wounds faster.

40:15.330 --> 40:16.372
You can do that?

40:16.456 --> 40:18.499
How do you think I'm still alive, kid?

40:18.583 --> 40:20.501
I'll learn how, just like you.

40:20.585 --> 40:22.253
Good.

40:22.337 --> 40:24.880
Tomorrow we start with knives.

40:24.965 --> 40:27.008
Try not to get stabbed.

40:28.009 --> 40:29.970
-Stick?
-Yeah?

40:31.512 --> 40:33.514
I have something for you.

40:39.104 --> 40:41.147
It's a bracelet.

40:42.482 --> 40:45.818
From the wrapper on the ice cream
you got me when we first met.

40:46.819 --> 40:48.488
You remember?

40:49.405 --> 40:50.991
I do.

41:01.126 --> 41:02.835
Your training is over.

41:04.170 --> 41:06.006
I can't help you anymore.

41:11.469 --> 41:12.595
What?

41:13.888 --> 41:14.889
Why?

41:15.723 --> 41:16.807
[sighs]

41:16.891 --> 41:19.060
I expected too much of you.

41:59.017 --> 42:01.061
You promised me
you weren't gonna kill anyone.

42:01.686 --> 42:02.812
Yep.

42:04.814 --> 42:06.857
Then what the hell was that back there?

42:06.941 --> 42:08.359
The mission.

42:10.361 --> 42:13.948
That's what your war's come to?
Killing children?

42:14.990 --> 42:17.410
That thing in the container
was not a child.

42:17.493 --> 42:18.911
I could hear his heartbeat.

42:18.994 --> 42:21.747
It was light and fast.
He hadn't even hit puberty.

42:21.831 --> 42:24.292
-You're emotional.
-Yeah, no shit.

42:25.668 --> 42:29.380
If you'd have focused
beyond your crybaby feelings,

42:29.464 --> 42:31.632
you would've sensed
what that kid really was.

42:31.716 --> 42:33.384
He was just a kid.

42:34.635 --> 42:36.596
You're blind as you ever were.

42:37.305 --> 42:40.475
Maybe you should've stuck around
and finished training me yourself.

42:40.558 --> 42:43.769
I needed a soldier.
You wanted a father.

42:44.687 --> 42:47.190
Well, I guess
we're both disappointed then.

42:47.273 --> 42:48.858
I guess we are.

42:48.941 --> 42:50.068
[grunts]

42:52.820 --> 42:54.239
You take care of yourself, Matty.

42:54.322 --> 42:55.948
I'm not gonna let you kill that kid.

42:56.991 --> 42:58.576
Oh, he's already dead.

42:58.659 --> 43:02.913
I caught up with the van while you
were dicking around with Nobu's men.

43:04.039 --> 43:06.126
I put an arrow in that thing's heart.

43:06.751 --> 43:08.128
[Matt yelling]

43:21.141 --> 43:23.934
You can't even tag an old man.

43:50.461 --> 43:51.671
Get up.

43:56.134 --> 43:57.343
Get up!

44:01.972 --> 44:03.224
Get up!

44:08.938 --> 44:10.022
[exclaims]

44:50.646 --> 44:51.897
[groans]

44:53.566 --> 44:55.443
[both breathing heavily]

45:04.201 --> 45:05.620
Get out of my city.

45:05.703 --> 45:06.787
[grunts]

45:08.664 --> 45:10.375
[breathing heavily]

45:13.794 --> 45:16.171
Maybe there's hope for you yet.

45:16.797 --> 45:17.923
[laughs]

45:18.966 --> 45:20.050
[groaning]

45:25.139 --> 45:26.391
[panting]

45:29.560 --> 45:31.271
Nice catching up.

45:31.937 --> 45:32.980
Eh?

45:33.856 --> 45:37.568
You can keep the sticks.
You're gonna need 'em.

45:49.830 --> 45:52.958
What part of "Don't tell anyone
about this" didn't you understand?

45:53.042 --> 45:54.710
Foggy's not just anyone... all right?

45:54.794 --> 45:56.211
He's a kick-ass attorney,

45:56.296 --> 45:57.963
and sooner or later
we're gonna need one of those.

45:59.256 --> 46:01.384
And he just plain kicks ass.

46:02.510 --> 46:04.094
When the need arises.

46:05.220 --> 46:07.765
[Karen]
You can trust him, Ben.

46:07.848 --> 46:09.892
He's one of the good ones.

46:12.102 --> 46:13.979
Show him the board.

46:15.690 --> 46:17.983
All right, Ben has everything laid out...

46:18.067 --> 46:22.697
all of the, uh, possible connections...
starting at the bottom...

46:22.780 --> 46:25.074
and moving up.

46:25.950 --> 46:27.201
The king of diamonds?

46:27.284 --> 46:28.869
The man at the top.

46:28.953 --> 46:30.413
Any idea who he is?

46:30.496 --> 46:31.831
No.

46:31.914 --> 46:34.291
But I think he might have been
the one behind Union Allied.

46:34.375 --> 46:36.919
There's another player on the field.

46:38.045 --> 46:39.380
Man in black.

46:39.464 --> 46:41.716
You think he's working for the king?

46:41.799 --> 46:43.092
No.

46:43.175 --> 46:47.179
No, he never would have helped me
expose Union Allied if he were.

46:48.514 --> 46:50.099
If that's the case...

46:51.351 --> 46:52.935
they're working against each other.

46:53.978 --> 46:55.771
So the question is...

46:59.692 --> 47:01.777
which one trumps the other?

48:08.719 --> 48:10.012
It's done.

48:11.055 --> 48:12.264
Black Sky...

48:13.849 --> 48:15.685
no longer a threat.

48:16.686 --> 48:18.979
[man] For now.

48:19.063 --> 48:20.815
What about Murdock?

48:22.983 --> 48:26.403
Stubborn, immature...

48:26.487 --> 48:27.655
[laughs]

48:29.156 --> 48:31.701
still a real pain in the ass.

48:32.743 --> 48:35.162
Will he be ready when the doors open?

48:38.332 --> 48:39.584
[sighs]

48:42.169 --> 48:45.089
I have no idea.

48:48.551 --> 48:50.553
[dramatic music playing]
