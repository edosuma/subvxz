WEBVTT

00:04.475 --> 00:06.543
Huh? Amazing, right?

00:06.577 --> 00:08.590
- Yeah.
- Bathroom.

00:08.624 --> 00:09.609
Bedrooms.

00:09.643 --> 00:10.644
Nice.

00:10.679 --> 00:13.335
Views of other
bedrooms and bathrooms.

00:13.369 --> 00:16.306
I really appreciate you
letting me crash here, bud.

00:16.341 --> 00:17.740
Are you kidding?
You're doing us a favor.

00:17.775 --> 00:20.347
No flush Tony
just moved out last week.

00:21.420 --> 00:22.489
You're sure this
isn't a problem?

00:22.524 --> 00:23.590
Seriously, the best day
of my life

00:23.625 --> 00:25.459
was when I heard you got
traded to the rangers.

00:25.493 --> 00:27.357
You're family. My place
is your place, man.

00:27.392 --> 00:28.590
Technically, it's my place.

00:30.459 --> 00:31.693
Okay, and next time I say,

00:31.728 --> 00:33.662
"Hey, let me
help you with that,"

00:33.696 --> 00:36.765
let's try
"No thanks, I got it."

00:38.472 --> 00:40.671
You look like an eater.

00:40.706 --> 00:42.510
So, just so we're clear,

00:42.544 --> 00:43.710
the left side
of the fridge is mine.

00:45.547 --> 00:47.349
I got it.
Tucker, come on.

00:47.383 --> 00:48.783
My brother
and my best friend--

00:48.818 --> 00:50.651
It's never gonna get
any better than this.

00:50.685 --> 00:52.355
The three of us together,

00:52.389 --> 00:54.390
there's nothing
that's gonna stop us.

00:58.796 --> 01:00.464
Except for maybe that.

01:03.435 --> 01:05.302
There's a baby on my doormat.

01:27.654 --> 01:29.389
But whoever left it,
they couldn't have gotten far.

01:30.825 --> 01:32.459
Stay there, baby.

01:32.493 --> 01:33.493
Make sure she stays there!

01:38.667 --> 01:39.700
I'm just saying,

01:39.735 --> 01:41.468
for a woman who
just had a baby,

01:41.503 --> 01:42.803
she moves remarkably fast.

01:43.839 --> 01:45.606
How could she just
leave her here?

01:45.641 --> 01:46.674
Ben, you gotta calm down, okay?

01:46.708 --> 01:48.810
I'm sure she's not even
your baby.

01:48.845 --> 01:50.344
Exactly, it could
just as easily

01:50.379 --> 01:51.445
be your baby, right?

01:54.515 --> 01:56.483
Not so much, no.

01:57.485 --> 01:58.685
And I've only been
in town an hour.

01:58.719 --> 02:01.421
I mean, I'm fast, but...

02:01.455 --> 02:02.621
I'm not that fast.

02:02.656 --> 02:04.290
This is not my baby.

02:04.324 --> 02:05.457
Wait, wait, wait!

02:05.491 --> 02:07.625
Guys, we got a note.

02:07.660 --> 02:08.693
Her name's Emma.

02:10.463 --> 02:11.730
I don't know any Emmas.

02:11.765 --> 02:14.533
The baby's name is Emma.

02:14.568 --> 02:17.536
Hi, Emma.

02:19.507 --> 02:20.640
Hey, Ben.
Did I ever tell you

02:20.675 --> 02:22.709
about that hot waitress
I went out with named Emma?

02:22.743 --> 02:24.511
Danny, focus!

02:24.546 --> 02:25.546
The mother.

02:25.580 --> 02:26.547
- Oh, yeah.
- Who's the mother?

02:26.581 --> 02:27.748
Sorry, um,

02:27.782 --> 02:28.782
Angela.

02:30.819 --> 02:32.486
Angela!

02:32.521 --> 02:34.321
- Of course.
- That's right.

02:34.356 --> 02:35.322
Who is Angela?

02:35.356 --> 02:36.557
She was nice. Actress.

02:36.591 --> 02:38.558
That girl was crazy.

02:39.794 --> 02:41.628
Does it say anything else?

02:41.662 --> 02:44.330
Uh, she's sorry.

02:44.364 --> 02:46.432
She didn't know
what else to do.

02:46.466 --> 02:47.733
And she just needs
a little time.

02:47.767 --> 02:49.368
Time? How much time?!

02:50.503 --> 02:51.704
And that would be
the perfect amount of time.

02:51.738 --> 02:52.705
Oh.

02:52.739 --> 02:54.474
That's Riley.

02:54.508 --> 02:55.675
I gave her a call
while you were outside.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.377
Riley?

02:57.411 --> 02:59.412
Fatpants Perrin?

02:59.447 --> 03:00.413
What's she doing here?

03:00.448 --> 03:02.383
You have a friend
named Fatpants?

03:03.619 --> 03:05.753
Oh, I'm definitely
marking my food.

03:05.788 --> 03:07.622
No.

03:07.656 --> 03:09.491
Riley's in law school now.

03:09.525 --> 03:10.559
It took her a while.

03:10.593 --> 03:12.327
I guess the LSAT's
kind of tricky,

03:12.362 --> 03:13.762
but trust me, she will
know what to do.

03:18.436 --> 03:20.504
Ri-Gantor?

03:20.538 --> 03:22.472
Ben-wetter!

03:22.507 --> 03:23.574
Look at you.

03:24.609 --> 03:26.376
You look amazing.

03:26.410 --> 03:27.544
How did that happen?

03:28.646 --> 03:30.414
I may have lost a pound or two.

03:30.448 --> 03:31.448
Hundred.

03:32.650 --> 03:33.750
You sat on my head and gave me

03:33.784 --> 03:35.519
a concussion, remember?

03:35.553 --> 03:37.754
Tuck, Riley.
Riley, Tucker.

03:37.789 --> 03:39.323
Hi.

03:39.357 --> 03:40.557
Riley grew up across
the street from us

03:40.592 --> 03:41.658
and used to kick
the crap out of Ben

03:41.693 --> 03:42.793
every day of his life.

03:42.828 --> 03:44.762
Oh, and congrats
on the law school thing.

03:44.797 --> 03:46.397
- Thanks.
- Don't worry--I know a bunch

03:46.432 --> 03:47.632
of people that had
a hard time getting in.

03:49.501 --> 03:51.670
- Ow, ow, ow, ow!
- Why did you tell him that?

03:52.805 --> 03:53.805
I didn't do anything.

03:56.609 --> 03:58.343
Oh.

03:58.378 --> 03:59.678
Hey.

03:59.712 --> 04:02.581
Hey, it's okay, princess.

04:03.683 --> 04:05.651
Aren't you gonna pick her up?

04:07.321 --> 04:08.721
Me?

04:08.755 --> 04:09.722
What, you guys see breasts

04:09.756 --> 04:11.557
and instantly think mommy?

04:13.560 --> 04:15.694
Okay, fine.

04:15.729 --> 04:17.529
Hi.

04:17.564 --> 04:18.630
Okay.

04:18.665 --> 04:20.599
Come here, angel.

04:20.632 --> 04:22.434
Oh.

04:26.473 --> 04:27.440
Hi.

04:28.709 --> 04:29.809
Believe me,

04:29.843 --> 04:31.477
I know how scary it is
to wake up

04:31.512 --> 04:32.511
in a strange place.

04:39.685 --> 04:41.352
I'm just making conversation.

04:42.454 --> 04:43.754
Are you hungry?

04:43.789 --> 04:45.489
I bet you're hungry, huh?

04:45.523 --> 04:47.624
Let's see
what you got--

04:47.659 --> 04:49.793
Is this all you
brought with you?

04:49.828 --> 04:51.562
Oh, well, that's okay.

04:51.596 --> 04:53.364
We'll just send
one of these boys out

04:53.398 --> 04:54.765
for provisions and--

04:54.799 --> 04:56.566
Oh...

04:56.601 --> 04:58.369
I think somebody
needs her diaper changed.

04:58.403 --> 04:59.403
I'll go to the store.

04:59.437 --> 05:00.371
Yeah, I'm going, too.

05:01.639 --> 05:02.706
No.

05:04.309 --> 05:06.744
Boys are so stupid,
aren't they?

05:06.778 --> 05:08.380
Yes, they are.

05:08.414 --> 05:09.647
They're so stupid.

05:09.682 --> 05:11.282
<i>Yes, they are.</i>

05:11.316 --> 05:12.617
All right, so then you just

05:12.651 --> 05:14.618
stick the tabs down,

05:14.653 --> 05:16.420
and voila,

05:16.455 --> 05:17.655
she's good to go.

05:17.689 --> 05:18.656
Oh.

05:18.690 --> 05:19.657
Hold her while
I get her bottle ready,

05:19.691 --> 05:20.658
- would you?
- Uh, me?

05:20.692 --> 05:22.660
I'm not really a baby person.

05:23.729 --> 05:24.729
Hold her.

05:26.000 --> 05:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:37.375 --> 05:38.475
Whee!

05:38.510 --> 05:39.610
Isn't this fun?

05:39.644 --> 05:41.345
There you go.

05:41.379 --> 05:42.580
All right.

05:42.614 --> 05:44.448
Want to maybe, uh,

05:44.483 --> 05:45.716
take a step over here?

05:45.751 --> 05:46.751
Is she okay?

05:46.785 --> 05:47.752
Uh-huh.

05:49.688 --> 05:51.389
Have a seat.

05:51.423 --> 05:53.324
Oh.

05:53.359 --> 05:54.759
Nice and easy.

05:56.728 --> 05:57.828
Ah.

06:01.533 --> 06:04.568
Is she having fun?

06:04.603 --> 06:05.670
Yeah.

06:05.704 --> 06:07.371
You guys look comfy.

06:10.742 --> 06:12.409
I can't believe
this is happening.

06:14.479 --> 06:15.613
I'm not ready to be a dad.

06:17.415 --> 06:18.615
What if Angela
never comes back?

06:18.650 --> 06:19.783
Oh, my God, taste this.

06:24.322 --> 06:25.623
Yo.

06:25.657 --> 06:28.492
Chicken, carrots, and pasta.

06:28.526 --> 06:30.328
Okay?

06:30.362 --> 06:31.529
All in this little jar.

06:33.465 --> 06:34.499
It's like, gross,

06:34.533 --> 06:35.700
yet oddly delicious.

06:39.506 --> 06:41.574
Come on, man.
It's gonna be okay.

06:41.608 --> 06:42.609
How do you know?

06:42.643 --> 06:44.410
I don't, but it's all I got.

06:45.746 --> 06:46.747
Excuse me,

06:46.781 --> 06:49.516
how old is your baby?

06:49.551 --> 06:50.651
Oh, um...

06:50.685 --> 06:51.651
That's a good question.

06:52.754 --> 06:54.521
I met Angela at that
party in the village...

06:54.556 --> 06:56.456
- Mm.
- And we dated for maybe six weeks

06:56.491 --> 06:57.457
before we were...

06:57.492 --> 06:58.725
Intimate.

07:01.762 --> 07:02.728
And she broke up with me

07:02.762 --> 07:05.297
pretty much right after that.

07:05.332 --> 07:07.399
I'm sure there was
no correlation.

07:08.701 --> 07:10.368
So, we're into August now,

07:10.402 --> 07:11.736
and they take,
like, nine months

07:11.770 --> 07:13.271
once they're up and running.

07:13.305 --> 07:14.272
I think so.

07:14.306 --> 07:15.305
So...

07:22.646 --> 07:23.612
Three months.

07:23.647 --> 07:25.448
Three months!

07:25.482 --> 07:26.515
My baby's three months old.

07:30.553 --> 07:31.720
Mm-mm.

07:31.755 --> 07:34.390
- Put this back.
- What?

07:34.424 --> 07:35.391
She ain't got no teeth.

07:35.425 --> 07:36.492
Put it back.

07:37.728 --> 07:39.596
So, the first thing
Ben has to do

07:39.630 --> 07:40.730
is take a paternity test.

07:43.400 --> 07:44.667
I mean,

07:44.701 --> 07:46.669
though it's pretty obvious
she's his.

07:48.372 --> 07:49.571
Same smile,

07:49.606 --> 07:50.739
<i>same ears,</i>

07:50.773 --> 07:52.574
same little sparkly
fleck of yellow

07:52.608 --> 07:53.709
in the iris.

07:56.646 --> 07:58.380
What?

07:58.414 --> 07:59.447
Do I have something in my nose?

07:59.481 --> 08:00.414
I know you guys think
that's funny,

08:00.448 --> 08:01.615
but it's not.

08:01.650 --> 08:03.517
You like Ben.

08:03.551 --> 08:05.318
What?

08:05.353 --> 08:06.453
No, that's insane.

08:06.487 --> 08:08.354
I've tormented the guy
every day of my life.

08:08.389 --> 08:09.355
Holy crap!

08:09.390 --> 08:10.557
You really do like Ben.

08:11.759 --> 08:13.259
We're back.

08:13.294 --> 08:14.494
Hey. Ben,
you're not gonna believe

08:14.529 --> 08:15.495
what Riley was just--

08:15.530 --> 08:16.696
- Aah!
- How'd it go?

08:17.732 --> 08:19.299
You guys left

08:19.333 --> 08:20.367
and I realized I should have

08:20.401 --> 08:21.368
given you a list.

08:21.403 --> 08:22.636
Why? I mean,
everyone knows

08:22.670 --> 08:24.504
you're not supposed to
give a baby solid food

08:24.539 --> 08:25.572
until it's at least
four months old

08:25.606 --> 08:26.573
and sitting up on its own.

08:26.607 --> 08:27.707
That woman was mean.

08:29.711 --> 08:31.578
I think we're all done here.

08:31.612 --> 08:33.447
Oh, all right.

08:33.481 --> 08:34.515
Just one good belch

08:34.549 --> 08:35.582
and she's done.

08:35.616 --> 08:36.751
I think you can
handle this part.

08:36.784 --> 08:37.751
What, me? Right now?
Are you sure?

08:37.785 --> 08:39.587
Hey, Tucker?

08:39.621 --> 08:41.323
Oh, okay.

08:41.357 --> 08:42.424
- Great. Danny?
- Yeah?

08:42.457 --> 08:43.424
- You're in charge.
- Wait.

08:43.458 --> 08:44.560
You're not leaving, are you?

08:44.594 --> 08:45.595
- Yes.
- No, I'll be good. I promise.

08:45.629 --> 08:47.330
I showed you
how to do everything.

08:47.364 --> 08:48.631
Yeah, but I wasn't
paying attention.

08:48.665 --> 08:49.665
You can't go.

08:49.699 --> 08:51.400
Ben, tell Riley she can't go.

08:51.434 --> 08:52.467
- You can't go.
- Bye.

08:52.502 --> 08:54.436
Ooh, wow, Ben.

08:56.338 --> 08:57.572
I never noticed how sparkly

08:57.606 --> 08:58.773
your eyes are.

09:01.743 --> 09:03.277
Please, Riley.

09:03.311 --> 09:04.278
We'll never make it
through the night

09:04.312 --> 09:05.279
without you.

09:14.689 --> 09:16.357
Fine.

09:16.391 --> 09:17.425
I'll stay.

09:19.695 --> 09:22.464
See? That's what
I'm talking about.

09:23.666 --> 09:24.700
Right?
Hey, she didn't spit up

09:24.734 --> 09:25.734
on my shirt though, did she?

09:28.371 --> 09:29.571
- No, looks good.
- No, no, you're great.

09:29.606 --> 09:31.306
Brand new, bud.

09:31.341 --> 09:32.541
Good. All right.

09:45.410 --> 09:46.544
I should be back by five.

09:46.578 --> 09:47.645
Wait. Where
are you going?

09:47.679 --> 09:49.313
Uh, work.
I got a shift.

09:49.347 --> 09:50.480
Wait, you couldn't get anyone
to cover for you?

09:50.515 --> 09:52.416
Oh, see, that would have
been a good idea.

09:52.450 --> 09:53.417
Too late now.

09:53.451 --> 09:54.418
No, wait, bro.

09:54.452 --> 09:55.485
Tuck and I are not
watching your kid.

09:55.520 --> 09:57.187
Yeah.
The big guy's right.

09:57.221 --> 09:58.321
I mean, there is no--

09:58.355 --> 09:59.422
Hey!

09:59.456 --> 10:01.324
Thanks, man.
See you!

10:01.358 --> 10:03.393
How does this
keep happening to me?

10:08.332 --> 10:10.233
Whoa.

10:13.538 --> 10:14.538
Oh.

10:16.707 --> 10:19.210
Wow. Very impressive.

10:19.244 --> 10:21.278
And who said you had
no discernable skills?

10:21.313 --> 10:22.546
I think that was you.

10:24.416 --> 10:26.351
Riley,
what am I supposed to do?

10:26.385 --> 10:28.486
Well, there's not really
that much we can do

10:28.521 --> 10:30.655
until Angela comes back.

10:30.690 --> 10:32.224
But I think we should
probably talk about

10:32.258 --> 10:33.625
the elephant in the room.

10:33.660 --> 10:35.294
Which for once isn't me.

10:36.730 --> 10:38.631
How much do you
want to be involved?

10:38.665 --> 10:41.501
I don't know what I want.

10:41.535 --> 10:43.535
Last year, I was
doing construction.

10:43.570 --> 10:44.636
Before that,
I was waiting tables.

10:44.671 --> 10:46.638
Now I'm flipping bottles.

10:46.673 --> 10:49.307
I haven't figured
my life out yet.

10:49.342 --> 10:50.308
I'm not you.

10:50.343 --> 10:51.476
What does that mean?

10:51.510 --> 10:53.244
Oh!
Come on.

10:53.278 --> 10:54.378
College,

10:54.412 --> 10:55.513
law school, this...

10:55.547 --> 10:57.348
Transformation.

10:58.683 --> 11:02.186
You see what you want
and you go for it.

11:02.220 --> 11:03.654
Yeah.

11:03.689 --> 11:04.689
Not always.

11:06.292 --> 11:07.492
Oh!

11:07.526 --> 11:09.461
Ice down my bra.

11:10.497 --> 11:11.563
Hey.

11:11.598 --> 11:13.299
I'm really sorry
I sat on your head

11:13.333 --> 11:14.400
all those times.

11:15.635 --> 11:16.602
Angela's back.

11:16.637 --> 11:17.637
I'm on break, man.

11:18.672 --> 11:21.373
I'm sorry I sat on your head.

11:21.408 --> 11:22.508
Smooth move, Fatpants.

11:22.542 --> 11:23.542
Yes.

11:25.478 --> 11:26.545
Where is she?
Where's Angela?

11:26.579 --> 11:27.613
First of all,

11:27.647 --> 11:29.381
she woke up the baby.

11:31.417 --> 11:32.450
Second, she wanted me

11:32.484 --> 11:33.484
to give you that envelope.

11:33.518 --> 11:35.553
You let her leave?

11:35.587 --> 11:36.653
What's the matter with you?

11:36.688 --> 11:38.354
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:38.389 --> 11:40.590
My bad, but I was
a little preoccupied

11:40.624 --> 11:42.425
raising your child.

11:44.561 --> 11:46.729
Read it. I think
you'll be happy.

11:48.265 --> 11:49.265
They're adoption papers.

11:49.299 --> 11:50.700
She's putting Emma
up for adoption

11:50.734 --> 11:52.602
and she needs me
to relinquish my rights.

11:55.606 --> 11:57.607
If I sign this,
I'm not a father anymore.

11:57.641 --> 11:59.576
Amazing, right?

12:01.312 --> 12:02.445
Well, see, I'm not the only one

12:02.480 --> 12:04.447
who's excited.

12:04.482 --> 12:07.517
Yay! Whoo!

12:14.391 --> 12:16.659
So, I sign this
and Emma has a new daddy?

12:16.693 --> 12:18.193
Pretty much.

12:18.228 --> 12:19.194
The letter says
they already have

12:19.229 --> 12:20.296
a family lined up.

12:22.699 --> 12:24.301
If I do this,

12:24.335 --> 12:26.236
if I let her go,

12:26.270 --> 12:27.337
I don't want to hear about it.

12:27.372 --> 12:29.440
I never want to talk
about it again, okay?

12:29.474 --> 12:31.542
- Okay.
- Okay.

12:33.345 --> 12:36.381
Where is my precious
little grandbaby?

12:36.416 --> 12:38.317
Mom, what are you doing here?

12:38.351 --> 12:39.418
I'm a grandma!

12:39.452 --> 12:40.586
- Hey, ma.
- Aah!

12:40.620 --> 12:41.587
What is she doing here?

12:41.621 --> 12:42.654
Did you tell her?

12:42.689 --> 12:44.556
I didn't even tell her
I was here.

12:44.591 --> 12:45.624
Oh, I'll get to you.

12:47.361 --> 12:48.528
Oh.

12:48.562 --> 12:49.696
Hi.

12:49.730 --> 12:52.332
Oh, she is just

12:52.366 --> 12:54.701
a big ol' pile of love.

12:54.735 --> 12:56.503
Yeah, I really don't
think that's love

12:56.537 --> 12:57.571
that you're smelling.

12:59.540 --> 13:01.475
Okay, who wants
to explain to me

13:01.509 --> 13:03.578
why I had to hear
that I was a grandma

13:03.612 --> 13:06.314
while I was
getting my nails done?

13:06.348 --> 13:08.450
That Jennifer Perrin
couldn't wait

13:08.484 --> 13:10.185
to let me have it.

13:10.219 --> 13:11.620
Ever since that
Fatpants daughter of hers

13:11.654 --> 13:13.422
got into law school
she's just--

13:17.428 --> 13:18.495
Hi, Riley.

13:20.631 --> 13:22.398
I didn't see you there.

13:22.433 --> 13:25.268
You're so thin now,
you should wear a bell.

13:29.439 --> 13:30.439
Oh.

13:33.676 --> 13:35.277
Is this duct tape?

13:38.547 --> 13:41.282
We were having a closure issue.

13:41.317 --> 13:43.285
Oh, what, you couldn't
find a stapler?

13:43.319 --> 13:44.352
Honestly.

13:44.387 --> 13:46.288
I can't sign those papers now.

13:46.323 --> 13:47.289
It's not gonna happen.

13:47.324 --> 13:48.591
Hey, don't worry about mom.

13:48.625 --> 13:50.226
You gotta do
what you think is right.

13:50.260 --> 13:51.361
I'll totally back you up.

13:51.395 --> 13:52.362
What papers?

13:52.396 --> 13:53.630
You're on your own, bro.

13:58.369 --> 13:59.670
Mom...

13:59.704 --> 14:01.271
I have some news.

14:01.306 --> 14:02.572
Yeah. You knocked up
some girl

14:02.607 --> 14:04.207
because you couldn't
figure out the basics

14:04.241 --> 14:05.308
of birth control.

14:05.342 --> 14:06.542
We're past that, honey, okay?

14:08.445 --> 14:09.411
Mrs. Wheeler?

14:09.446 --> 14:10.546
Bonnie.

14:10.580 --> 14:12.547
- Really?
- Mrs. Wheeler.

14:12.582 --> 14:15.350
Emma's mom wants to put
Emma up for adoption

14:15.384 --> 14:17.252
and for Ben
to sign away his rights.

14:18.253 --> 14:19.286
Really?

14:20.455 --> 14:22.257
So you're--

14:22.291 --> 14:24.325
you're thinking about
giving up this little girl?

14:25.594 --> 14:27.295
Yeah, I was thinking about it.

14:29.398 --> 14:31.199
Oh, good.

14:32.235 --> 14:33.302
Good-- what do you
mean, good?

14:33.336 --> 14:34.470
Oh, Ben, honey.

14:34.504 --> 14:36.438
You can't begin to understand

14:36.473 --> 14:37.673
the kind of sacrifice it takes

14:37.707 --> 14:39.341
to be a parent.

14:39.376 --> 14:40.442
When I married your father,

14:40.477 --> 14:41.443
and I had you two,

14:41.478 --> 14:43.245
I had to put my dreams on hold.

14:43.280 --> 14:45.514
- What dreams?
- Being single and childless.

14:48.285 --> 14:49.486
Ben...

14:49.520 --> 14:51.221
Honey, I love you,

14:51.256 --> 14:53.290
but you can't raise
this little girl.

14:53.325 --> 14:55.259
You haven't even finished
raising yourself.

14:55.293 --> 14:56.527
You can't cook,

14:56.562 --> 14:58.396
you're barely
paying your bills...

14:58.430 --> 15:00.364
Honey, I still buy your pants.

15:06.470 --> 15:08.604
This baby
needs a grown-up.

15:08.639 --> 15:10.372
You gotta sign those papers.

15:17.102 --> 15:18.114
9 am.

15:18.722 --> 15:19.689
She'll be ready.

15:21.969 --> 15:23.057
Done.

15:23.274 --> 15:24.341
Somebody from
the adoption agency

15:24.375 --> 15:27.177
will be here first thing
in the morning.

15:27.212 --> 15:28.179
You okay?

15:28.213 --> 15:30.482
Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

15:30.516 --> 15:32.217
Ben, if you don't
want to do this, man--

15:32.251 --> 15:33.351
It doesn't matter.

15:33.386 --> 15:35.321
Mom was right.

15:35.355 --> 15:36.355
I couldn't raise this baby

15:36.389 --> 15:37.456
even if I wanted to.

15:37.490 --> 15:40.126
Bro, it's going to be okay.

15:40.160 --> 15:41.161
It happened,

15:41.195 --> 15:42.162
you dealt with it,

15:42.196 --> 15:43.363
and now, like you said,

15:43.397 --> 15:45.264
we're never talking
about this again.

15:47.134 --> 15:48.501
I could have been a model.

15:50.436 --> 15:52.470
But you've seen
your uncle Danny.

15:52.504 --> 15:53.505
Yeah.

15:53.539 --> 15:56.341
No body could
recover from that.

15:58.344 --> 16:00.045
He was so big,

16:00.079 --> 16:02.413
I had to have
a "c," "d," and "e" section.

16:05.451 --> 16:07.051
No, don't.
I swear to God.

16:07.085 --> 16:08.319
- Okay. Okay.
- No, I will hurt you.

16:08.353 --> 16:09.353
Okay.

16:10.355 --> 16:11.422
<i>So...</i>

16:11.456 --> 16:13.157
Did you always like Ben?

16:13.191 --> 16:15.125
Oh, my God, you're obsessed.

16:16.294 --> 16:19.228
I don't know.
Kind of.

16:19.263 --> 16:20.396
Guess I always thought
maybe someday,

16:20.430 --> 16:21.431
but back then I just figured

16:21.465 --> 16:23.266
I was too fat,
or too--

16:23.300 --> 16:25.468
loud, or too hairy, or--

16:25.502 --> 16:28.404
Okay, we're not making a list.

16:28.439 --> 16:30.240
Well, you've grown
to be a beautiful

16:30.274 --> 16:31.441
and successful woman--
I think you can

16:31.476 --> 16:33.411
safely move on
from Ben Wheeler.

16:33.445 --> 16:35.113
Why would I want to do that?

16:35.147 --> 16:36.448
Uh, did you miss
the part in the story

16:36.482 --> 16:37.449
about the baby?

16:37.483 --> 16:39.284
The baby he doesn't
want to give up?

16:39.319 --> 16:41.387
If that's true, then why
did he make that call?

16:41.421 --> 16:43.122
Because his entire family

16:43.157 --> 16:45.124
is telling him he can't do it.

16:45.159 --> 16:46.125
If nobody believes in him,

16:46.160 --> 16:47.160
how can he believe in himself?

16:47.194 --> 16:49.029
He can't do it alone.

16:49.063 --> 16:50.230
You don't know that.

16:53.167 --> 16:54.434
Oh, it's Ben.

16:54.468 --> 16:55.435
Your mom's about
to leave him alone

16:55.470 --> 16:56.436
with the baby.

16:56.471 --> 16:57.437
You're going?

16:57.472 --> 16:59.540
"Alone" is in all caps.

17:01.109 --> 17:02.276
Ow! Ow!

17:02.310 --> 17:03.277
What was that for?

17:03.311 --> 17:05.045
For making me
talk about my feelings.

17:05.079 --> 17:06.280
You know I hate that.

17:06.314 --> 17:08.048
And go easy on your brother,

17:08.083 --> 17:09.150
okay?

17:09.184 --> 17:11.050
He looks up to you.

17:11.085 --> 17:13.019
In his eyes,
you have everything.

17:18.058 --> 17:19.391
Not everything.

17:23.396 --> 17:24.396
Wait, wait, wait!

17:24.430 --> 17:25.396
- Wait.
- Oh, my God.

17:25.431 --> 17:27.332
You-- you gotta
give me a minute.

17:31.403 --> 17:34.271
Maybe now I know
why I was traded.

17:37.075 --> 17:38.375
You were right.

17:38.409 --> 17:40.277
I didn't believe in him.

17:40.311 --> 17:42.079
I didn't think he could do it.

17:42.113 --> 17:43.447
So why are you telling me?

17:43.481 --> 17:45.215
Because...

17:45.250 --> 17:46.317
If you go in there
and help him,

17:46.351 --> 17:48.385
he'll never believe
in himself, either.

17:50.423 --> 17:52.358
Riley, Riley,
Riley, Riley, please?

17:52.392 --> 17:55.294
She's hungry,
or thirsty, or tired.

17:55.328 --> 17:57.463
I don't know,
I don't speak baby.

18:00.367 --> 18:01.367
Tuck.

18:02.470 --> 18:04.037
What is going on?

18:04.071 --> 18:05.071
Vanessa and I
were at the movies

18:05.105 --> 18:06.138
when Ben called and said

18:06.173 --> 18:07.406
Emma's having
some kind of meltdown.

18:07.441 --> 18:09.375
I don't think
Emma's the problem.

18:09.409 --> 18:10.442
Tucker, I swear

18:10.477 --> 18:12.311
if you're not home
in two seconds...

18:12.345 --> 18:14.146
I'm gonna eat all your food.

18:14.180 --> 18:16.013
Tucker?!

18:19.050 --> 18:20.050
Okay!

18:20.084 --> 18:21.318
Turn it off!

18:37.269 --> 18:38.335
Okay.

18:40.171 --> 18:41.138
So, it looks like
it's just gonna be

18:41.172 --> 18:42.239
you and me, huh?

18:44.143 --> 18:45.509
Guess we're really
gonna do this thing.

18:47.379 --> 18:49.013
Okay.

18:49.048 --> 18:50.182
Okay, Emma, hi.

18:50.216 --> 18:51.416
Hi, baby.

18:51.451 --> 18:52.451
Come on, it's okay.

18:55.089 --> 18:56.255
Please don't break,
please don't break,

18:56.290 --> 18:57.357
please don't break.

18:57.391 --> 18:58.358
Okay.

18:58.392 --> 19:00.994
Okay. It's okay.

19:01.029 --> 19:02.062
It's okay.

19:02.096 --> 19:03.430
It's okay.

19:03.464 --> 19:05.232
It's okay, Emma.

19:05.266 --> 19:06.366
Daddy's here.

19:06.401 --> 19:07.368
It's okay.

19:10.105 --> 19:11.071
Aah.

19:11.106 --> 19:12.106
It's okay.

19:16.010 --> 19:17.244
I'm telling you,
there is no way.

19:17.278 --> 19:19.279
Bodily functions
make him queasy.

19:19.314 --> 19:20.414
He can do it.

19:20.448 --> 19:22.048
Where's your faith, man.

19:24.485 --> 19:25.452
See?

19:25.486 --> 19:28.087
Here you go.

19:28.122 --> 19:29.355
There.

19:29.389 --> 19:30.989
Okay.

19:31.024 --> 19:32.224
Hi. Hi.

19:43.502 --> 19:44.502
Hi.

19:46.372 --> 19:47.405
Emma?

19:48.441 --> 19:50.175
Please eat.

19:50.210 --> 19:52.177
Come on, Emma.

19:52.212 --> 19:53.312
Look, look, Emma, it's good.

19:53.346 --> 19:54.379
It's good.

19:54.413 --> 19:56.215
Mmm.

19:59.052 --> 20:00.352
Oh, total lie.

20:00.387 --> 20:02.421
It's actually quite disgusting.

20:02.456 --> 20:04.256
No wonder you don't
want to eat.

20:07.294 --> 20:08.394
Please eat.

20:09.462 --> 20:11.397
Come on, Emma.
Just a sip, okay?

20:12.432 --> 20:13.432
Come on.

20:14.434 --> 20:16.035
Okay, come on.

20:16.069 --> 20:17.302
Come on, you have to eat.

20:17.337 --> 20:19.405
I'm begging you.

20:19.439 --> 20:21.073
Come--

20:37.489 --> 20:39.056
What?

20:39.091 --> 20:40.091
You like that?

20:42.327 --> 20:43.427
Look what daddy can do.

20:43.461 --> 20:45.061
Huh?

20:45.096 --> 20:47.163
I do this at work every day.

20:47.198 --> 20:48.331
Huh?

20:48.366 --> 20:49.432
You want some now?

20:49.467 --> 20:51.267
You want some?

20:51.302 --> 20:52.368
Here it comes.

20:52.403 --> 20:53.436
Here it comes, baby.

20:57.374 --> 21:00.108
Oh, my God, you're eating.

21:00.143 --> 21:03.011
Thank you so much.

21:04.246 --> 21:05.246
Holy crap,

21:05.281 --> 21:06.247
now I'm crying.

21:08.151 --> 21:10.051
Crap. Don't say crap.

21:10.086 --> 21:12.220
Don't use swear words.

21:12.255 --> 21:14.456
Oh, I can't believe
you're eating.

21:19.429 --> 21:21.063
You're so cute.

21:26.831 --> 21:28.565
Hey, wake up.

21:28.634 --> 21:30.267
Dude, you're drooling on me.

21:30.336 --> 21:31.335
Oh.

21:32.337 --> 21:33.270
Ahh...

21:33.339 --> 21:34.271
Boo!

21:34.340 --> 21:36.106
Ooh.

21:39.511 --> 21:40.444
Hey.

21:40.513 --> 21:42.179
Hey. You okay?

21:42.248 --> 21:43.247
Yeah.

21:44.582 --> 21:46.150
I think I want to do this.

21:47.419 --> 21:48.520
I can't let her go.

21:49.854 --> 21:51.121
I love her.

21:53.925 --> 21:55.292
Did you guys hear me?

21:55.361 --> 21:56.326
Yeah.

21:56.393 --> 21:57.326
Yeah, we heard you.

21:57.394 --> 21:58.361
You should probably
call the agency.

21:58.429 --> 21:59.429
It's almost 7:00.

21:59.498 --> 22:01.532
Come on, mi amor.

22:01.598 --> 22:02.532
Here we go.

22:02.601 --> 22:04.809
Ooh, somebody could use a bath.

22:06.104 --> 22:07.871
Oh. You both could.

22:07.938 --> 22:09.105
I'm gonna go get a bottle ready.

22:09.173 --> 22:10.473
But I want to give
it to her, okay?

22:10.541 --> 22:11.474
We're really gonna have to get

22:11.542 --> 22:12.542
on some kind of schedule though.

22:12.611 --> 22:13.861
- For real.
- What do you mean?

22:13.981 --> 22:15.445
Well, we have a
baby now so I mean,

22:15.512 --> 22:16.713
we kind of have to be adults.

22:16.782 --> 22:18.449
Okay. I'll do the shopping.

22:18.517 --> 22:20.518
Okay, but
let's talk about...
