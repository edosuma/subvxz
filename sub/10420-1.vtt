03:01.617 --> 03:05.735
Hold on, hold on!
It's Frapp, for Christ's sake!

03:05.817 --> 03:08.775
You damn fool!
You could have killed my horse!

03:09.457 --> 03:11.607
What's wrong with you, huh?

03:11.697 --> 03:13.767
Don't you wanna have fun no more?

03:14.537 --> 03:16.289
Too old for this, I reckon.

03:17.537 --> 03:20.654
- Damn you, Henry Frapp!
- Oh, shit. Damn.

03:20.737 --> 03:24.047
I thought you lost your hair
down in the Bayou Sallot.

03:24.137 --> 03:27.174
Hell, no! I aim to keep my scalp a while.

03:29.337 --> 03:31.726
Looks like you been trapping.
Where you been?

03:31.817 --> 03:34.775
Absaroka, Yellowstone. Where you up from?

03:34.857 --> 03:37.974
Been back in the settlements.
I just come from St Louis.

03:38.937 --> 03:40.768
- See any sign?
- Heap.

03:41.777 --> 03:44.575
Whole war party, Blackfoot,
working right hereabouts.

03:44.657 --> 03:47.729
No, they're Crow.
I seen the moccasin tracks.

03:47.817 --> 03:50.285
They've been trying to steal my horses
for a week.

03:50.377 --> 03:52.129
Them are Blackfoot.

03:52.217 --> 03:53.650
Crow, I reckon.

03:53.737 --> 03:56.649
Blackfoot! I can read sign, God damn it!

03:58.097 --> 04:00.406
- What's beaver in St Louis?
- $5.

04:01.217 --> 04:02.536
$5?

04:03.977 --> 04:08.129
Be a cold day in hell
before I sell my plews for $5.

04:08.217 --> 04:10.651
- How about in Taos?
- Same thing.

04:10.737 --> 04:13.615
Where the hell you been?
Don't you go to rendezvous no more?

04:13.697 --> 04:15.688
Not for a couple of winters now.

04:16.737 --> 04:18.887
- You heading there?
- You damn right!

04:18.976 --> 04:20.296
I got to get some whisky.

04:20.377 --> 04:23.369
If I don't get some whisky soon,
I'm gonna die!

04:23.897 --> 04:25.012
Hell.

04:25.377 --> 04:29.450
I've a mind to rendezvous myself,
if you don't mind the company.

04:29.537 --> 04:31.687
Glad to have you.
I need somebody who can shoot centre...

04:31.777 --> 04:34.086
...in case we got to fight them Blackfoot.

04:34.857 --> 04:37.894
- Crow!
- Blackfoot, God damn it!

04:40.857 --> 04:43.655
- Got any baccy?
- I guess so.

04:43.737 --> 04:45.455
- Give us a chaw.
- Yeah.

04:46.857 --> 04:49.974
No hard feelings, old coon? Oh, shit!

04:52.377 --> 04:53.730
Nary a one.

04:54.937 --> 04:56.450
Son of a bitch!

05:02.217 --> 05:04.048
Buffalo on the Platte?

05:05.097 --> 05:06.496
Mighty thin.

05:07.457 --> 05:10.290
Goddamn Pawnees been
shooting them again for the hides...

05:10.377 --> 05:12.732
...leaving the meat out
there to rot in the sun.

05:12.817 --> 05:14.250
What's old Bridger doing?

05:14.337 --> 05:17.693
I heard he was in Santa Fe,
bushwaying for a bunch of greasers.

05:17.777 --> 05:18.846
Mr Frapp! Whoa!

05:19.937 --> 05:22.656
- My God, Mr Frapp!
- Where you been, asshole?

05:23.377 --> 05:26.016
I made the assumption
you had gone downstream.

05:26.097 --> 05:29.055
You assumpted? Well, don't do
no more goddamn assumpting.

05:29.137 --> 05:32.288
- I thought you got lost again.
- Haven't you ever been lost?

05:33.097 --> 05:36.407
Fearsome confused for a month or two,
but I ain't never been lost.

05:36.817 --> 05:38.455
This here's Bill Tyler.

05:39.897 --> 05:42.536
You gonna shoot me with your ramrod?

05:45.017 --> 05:47.770
Now, that's Nat Wyeth from Massachusetts.

05:47.857 --> 05:49.734
Says he's a ice merchant.

05:50.257 --> 05:51.326
Ice?

05:52.137 --> 05:54.332
Got to take him to the rendezvous.

05:54.417 --> 05:58.251
I'm travelling to Oregon, Mr Tyler.

05:59.777 --> 06:02.007
I have a plan to send
salmon east in barrels.

06:02.097 --> 06:03.496
Salmon?

06:03.577 --> 06:06.569
Well, let's get to the rendezvous.
I got a powerful dry on.

06:06.657 --> 06:08.932
How you gonna get them barrels
over the Rockies?

06:09.017 --> 06:11.485
- Wagons, Mr Tyler.
- Wagons? You can't get wagons over...

06:11.577 --> 06:13.408
I'm joining a train of immigrants
at the rendezvous.

06:13.497 --> 06:15.055
Immigrants, huh?

06:15.897 --> 06:18.775
Lmmigrants! Lmmigrants!

06:23.937 --> 06:25.973
It's the promised land, Mr Tyler.

06:26.497 --> 06:29.534
What in the hell would
anyone want to go to Oregon for?

06:30.257 --> 06:32.088
To trade, to build...

06:32.177 --> 06:35.328
...to till the soil, to farm the land.

06:35.417 --> 06:38.648
You can't farm nothing in Oregon.
Won't nothing grow there.

06:38.737 --> 06:40.728
I could've told you that.
But he won't listen to me.

06:40.817 --> 06:43.775
Mark my word, Mr Tyler,
one day there'll be a wagon road...

06:43.857 --> 06:46.451
- ... all the way from St Louis to Oregon.
- Oh, bullshit!

06:46.537 --> 06:49.005
It's a new empire, virgin and untrammelled.

06:49.097 --> 06:51.452
- Hey, Henry, give us another chaw, will you?
- It's a land of...

06:51.537 --> 06:53.926
- Jesus.
... limitless opportunity.

06:56.297 --> 06:57.935
- Shit!
- What's wrong?

06:58.017 --> 07:00.485
What's wrong?
You can see what's wrong, can't you?

07:00.577 --> 07:01.976
Well, I don't see anything.

07:02.057 --> 07:04.696
- Well, you don't see it 'cause it ain't there.
- What ain't there?

07:04.777 --> 07:07.530
The goddamn rendezvous ain't there,
God damn it!

07:13.337 --> 07:17.376
- What's it say?
- How do I know what it says? You read this.

07:25.857 --> 07:29.611
"Come on to Popo Agie.
Plenty whisky and white women."

07:30.657 --> 07:33.615
Popo Agie? That can't be.

07:33.697 --> 07:36.257
The hell you say.
They got white women, ain't they?

07:36.337 --> 07:38.771
Hell and gone the other side of the Divide!

07:38.857 --> 07:40.006
Well, you don't expect them...

07:40.097 --> 07:42.850
...to go dragging them white women
all the way across the Rockies, do you?

07:58.297 --> 08:01.972
Traders been coming to the mountains
for rendezvous for 10 years.

08:02.057 --> 08:04.935
Now they got white women,
they won't leave the prairie. Shit.

08:05.017 --> 08:08.851
Before long, they'll have us
packing our plews clean back to St Louis.

08:09.657 --> 08:13.013
Listen, what do you plan to do
about them Blackfoot...

08:13.097 --> 08:15.372
...that's been following us all day long?

08:16.697 --> 08:18.449
- Crow.
- Blackfoot, God damn it!

08:18.537 --> 08:20.846
I know Blackfoot.
I can smell them a mile off.

08:20.937 --> 08:24.486
Well, you don't know hog jowls
from horseshit, 'cause they're Crow.

08:24.577 --> 08:28.411
They won't bother us none.
However, keep an eye on the horses.

08:29.497 --> 08:30.930
Crow ain't so bad.

08:31.017 --> 08:33.690
I spent a couple of winters with them
in the Absaroka.

08:33.777 --> 08:35.654
You trust their honour,
you'll be safe enough.

08:35.736 --> 08:39.173
You trust their honesty,
you're gonna lose your long johns, too.

08:40.817 --> 08:42.091
Hey, Henry!

08:42.177 --> 08:44.691
I hear you got into the money end
of this miserable business.

08:44.777 --> 08:48.133
Yeah. I packed in supplies from St Louis...

08:48.217 --> 08:50.412
...watered down the whisky,
jacked up the prices...

08:50.497 --> 08:51.816
...and went to trading for beaver.

08:51.897 --> 08:54.730
- Yeah? What happened?
- Lost my ass.

08:54.817 --> 08:57.172
Turned around
and sold everything to Fontenelle.

08:57.257 --> 08:59.168
Well, beaver will shine again.

09:00.297 --> 09:02.253
Look at these here plews of mine.

09:02.337 --> 09:04.293
It took you two years
to get them, too, didn't it?

09:04.377 --> 09:06.607
I mind the time you get
that many beaver in one fall hunt.

09:06.697 --> 09:08.653
And wait till you see what Fontenelle's
gonna give you for them...

09:08.737 --> 09:10.090
...when you get to the rendezvous.

09:10.217 --> 09:13.289
Well, damn Fontenelle!
I'm a free trapper, by God.

09:13.377 --> 09:16.255
I trade my plews
to the highest bidder, cash money.

09:16.337 --> 09:17.895
Well, then you're shit out of luck, son...

09:17.977 --> 09:20.332
...'cause Fontenelle's the only bidder
you got this year.

09:20.417 --> 09:21.770
Stand clear!

09:49.217 --> 09:50.252
What was that?

09:50.337 --> 09:52.134
- What was what?
- I heard something.

09:52.217 --> 09:55.289
You've been hearing something
all the way from Missouri.

10:01.697 --> 10:03.096
- You hear something, Tyler?
- I told you.

10:03.177 --> 10:05.611
Shut up! Hear that?

10:05.697 --> 10:07.574
I'm telling you, there
is something out there.

10:07.657 --> 10:09.727
Of course there's something out there.

10:09.817 --> 10:12.126
There's always something out there.

10:12.217 --> 10:15.573
Why, there's rabbits and coons
and mule deer...

10:16.497 --> 10:18.965
...and sometimes
there's just your own horses.

10:19.577 --> 10:20.896
That's it again!

10:21.257 --> 10:24.215
Set down, flatlander.

10:32.697 --> 10:35.575
- Blackfoot! Mind your scalp!
- They're Crow.

10:35.657 --> 10:37.295
You mind your own scalp.

10:37.377 --> 10:40.130
- What the hell are you doing, Tyler?
- Is he just gonna lie there?

10:40.217 --> 10:42.253
You want to get us killed?

10:42.337 --> 10:44.646
Them goddamn Blackfoot
is trying to steal my mules!

10:44.737 --> 10:47.490
Strikes me they're doing you a favour.
Now, looky here.

10:47.577 --> 10:50.091
Them Crow put the sneak on us
half an hour ago.

10:50.177 --> 10:51.576
There's at least 20 of them out there.

10:51.657 --> 10:54.410
Shit! I mind the time when
10-to-1 was good odds for mountain men.

10:54.497 --> 10:56.010
- 7-to-1.
- You don't count!

10:56.097 --> 10:58.691
God damn it, I ain't gonna lay here
and let them sons of bitches...

10:58.777 --> 11:03.567
You go out there now, you'll lose
half the horses and all your hair.

11:03.657 --> 11:05.375
I aim to keep them both.

11:25.177 --> 11:26.451
- Come on.
- What the hell?

11:26.537 --> 11:28.129
Roll out, roll out.

11:29.057 --> 11:32.094
There's your cayuse.
Saddle him and let's ride.

11:32.177 --> 11:34.293
- Well, how'd you get them back?
- I stole them back.

11:34.377 --> 11:36.288
Come on, we ain't got all day.

11:38.777 --> 11:40.256
That's Cross Otter.

11:40.737 --> 11:43.376
Damnedest pirate you ever saw.

11:44.697 --> 11:45.732
Blackfeet?

11:45.817 --> 11:49.332
No. He told you they was Crow,
didn't he, you goddamn idiot?

11:58.217 --> 11:59.332
What's he want?

11:59.417 --> 12:02.887
He wants the goddamn horses back.
What the hell you think he want?

12:05.577 --> 12:09.695
He says, "Smoke pipe friendly, go away".

12:10.657 --> 12:11.851
My ass.

12:12.857 --> 12:14.848
Come on in, Cross Otter!

12:21.417 --> 12:23.726
- What should I do?
- Just keep your hand on that scattergun.

12:23.817 --> 12:26.615
Don't take your eyes off them,
that's what you do.

12:44.337 --> 12:45.895
Jesus.

12:52.017 --> 12:54.167
Well, speak your piece, Cross Otter.

12:55.377 --> 12:56.605
Tyler...

12:58.337 --> 13:01.090
...your heart is black.

13:01.497 --> 13:04.216
Damn it, you stole them horses first,
and you know it.

13:04.297 --> 13:06.367
I have many men in my camp.

13:06.457 --> 13:08.573
Strong. Young.

13:09.137 --> 13:10.570
Maybe they kill you.

13:10.657 --> 13:13.330
You keep ahold of your young men,
or I'll lift their hair.

13:13.417 --> 13:15.931
But you stole our horses in the winter.

13:16.017 --> 13:17.655
Well, you stole them from me last fall.

13:17.737 --> 13:20.297
You're lucky
I didn't take your whole remuda.

13:21.657 --> 13:25.206
You give us presents, we go in peace.

13:25.297 --> 13:28.846
You can go in dog shit, dingleballs.
Had about enough out of you.

13:28.937 --> 13:31.895
Or we take, we take horses!

13:31.977 --> 13:34.047
Well, that'll be after the fight.

13:35.497 --> 13:38.728
You speak with your tongue,
like young girls.

13:41.777 --> 13:44.132
You eat dung of white cows!

13:45.937 --> 13:46.972
Shit!

13:47.057 --> 13:48.649
I assume now there's going to be a fight.

13:50.377 --> 13:53.449
I told you there was Blackfoot hereabouts.
God damn it!

13:53.537 --> 13:54.970
You might be right.

14:01.537 --> 14:03.016
Open your eyes, son.

14:14.417 --> 14:15.850
Come on, son, load!

14:16.857 --> 14:18.051
Load, damn it!

14:27.337 --> 14:29.407
After one or two of them bastards
gets killed...

14:29.497 --> 14:31.965
...they sure lose
their stomach for fighting.

14:41.937 --> 14:45.293
Crow dogs,
I crap on the graves of your fathers!

14:51.417 --> 14:53.647
Crow and Blackfeet don't get along,
it seems.

14:53.737 --> 14:55.614
Blackfoot don't get along with nobody.

14:55.697 --> 14:58.848
I've seen them take off a man's skin
a strip at a time.

14:58.937 --> 15:02.054
Blackfoot, come out and fight!

15:03.057 --> 15:04.172
Send me your men!

15:04.257 --> 15:07.215
Cross Otter, why don't you
quit your cussing and send for your braves?

15:07.297 --> 15:08.889
Men without balls!

15:20.657 --> 15:22.932
Now, that's something now, greenhorn.

15:25.137 --> 15:27.605
- I just took an arrow.
- I can see that.

15:28.697 --> 15:31.165
- Here, hold still.
- No! No!

15:32.297 --> 15:34.288
I ain't gonna hurt you, damn it!

15:35.937 --> 15:38.007
Good thing it weren't in too deep.

15:50.257 --> 15:53.567
- Crow warriors!
- Right on time, huh, shithead?

17:32.297 --> 17:35.130
Yeah! Crow strong warriors.

17:42.017 --> 17:45.805
You ought to stick to stealing horses.
Horse will carry you, at least.

17:49.737 --> 17:52.968
- Did you kill her?
- She damn near killed me.

17:53.057 --> 17:55.287
You got yourself a heap of trouble
is what you done.

17:55.377 --> 17:59.370
Yeah? What was I supposed to do?
Let Cross Otter cut her up for wolf bait?

18:00.937 --> 18:02.495
She's dead, Mr Tyler.

18:11.097 --> 18:12.416
Oh, shit.

18:13.857 --> 18:18.009
If you want to run,
show some sense, for Christ's sake!

18:18.097 --> 18:19.496
Run the other way!

18:19.577 --> 18:23.172
Before you know it, Cross Otter will be
back here with a fistful of bloody scalps.

18:23.257 --> 18:26.932
He won't make no bones about cutting
your fine long locks, neither.

18:38.257 --> 18:39.406
Excuse me.

18:44.537 --> 18:46.653
Oh, yeah. Heap of trouble.

19:02.297 --> 19:04.128
How many more will you kill?

19:05.497 --> 19:08.136
We have always fought the Crow.

19:08.217 --> 19:09.855
Not over squaw.

19:11.097 --> 19:13.657
Let the girl go. She means nothing to you.

19:13.737 --> 19:15.773
She is my woman.

19:16.497 --> 19:19.694
You treat her like a coyote bitch.

19:19.777 --> 19:22.416
It is not the girl for what she is.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.453
It is the long knives...

19:27.977 --> 19:29.615
...the hair-faces...

19:30.937 --> 19:33.292
...more and more of them.

19:35.297 --> 19:37.333
If they are not stopped...

19:37.897 --> 19:40.172
...there will be no food to hunt...

19:41.857 --> 19:45.850
...no lands left for us.

19:45.937 --> 19:49.725
Then why not try
and make peace with them, trade with them?

19:49.817 --> 19:51.967
They spit on our land...

19:54.377 --> 19:56.447
...destroy our buffalo herd...

19:59.777 --> 20:01.369
...trap our beaver.

20:05.817 --> 20:07.455
The hair-face...

20:09.217 --> 20:10.536
...big one...

20:11.257 --> 20:13.487
he opens the path for others.

20:16.737 --> 20:18.853
But he will not have her...

20:19.377 --> 20:22.767
...or one more thing belonging to my people.

20:25.937 --> 20:27.893
You're a Blackfoot, ain't you?

20:28.937 --> 20:31.132
I come from another village.

20:31.537 --> 20:33.892
My father sold me to Heavy Eagle.

20:34.217 --> 20:36.412
One horse, one gun.

20:37.777 --> 20:39.688
- Slave?
- Wife.

20:41.657 --> 20:44.046
- The same.
- Heavy Eagle.

20:46.177 --> 20:48.008
He beat you some, huh?

20:59.657 --> 21:01.534
Where'd you learn American?

21:03.697 --> 21:05.176
Fort McKenzie.

21:07.537 --> 21:09.767
In the summer we trade beaver there.

21:10.217 --> 21:11.855
You learned good.

21:12.777 --> 21:14.210
I go with you.

21:15.177 --> 21:16.246
No.

21:18.097 --> 21:19.576
You go your own way.

21:23.897 --> 21:25.888
I cannot go back to Heavy Eagle.

21:26.937 --> 21:28.131
Hell!

21:29.257 --> 21:31.248
You can come to rendezvous...

21:32.337 --> 21:34.726
...but, looky here,
after that you got to clear out.

21:34.817 --> 21:36.967
I packed a squaw along before.

21:37.057 --> 21:38.410
Six year.

21:38.497 --> 21:41.330
Damnedest slut as ever cried for foofaraw.

21:41.417 --> 21:44.534
Always wanting vermilion...

21:44.617 --> 21:47.654
...and blue beads and mirrors and such.

21:48.657 --> 21:51.694
Bedding down with every buck
that come her way.

21:53.657 --> 21:55.295
She was pretty, though.

22:08.177 --> 22:11.965
- What's your name?
- Running Moon.

22:15.257 --> 22:17.213
You'll clear out if I tell you.

23:49.097 --> 23:51.565
Whisky!

23:59.977 --> 24:01.330
Whisky!

24:10.217 --> 24:12.856
I'm a mountain man, by God!

24:12.937 --> 24:15.087
I can whip any 10 of you niggers!

24:18.977 --> 24:21.969
I'm sorry. Mistake. Accident.

24:25.617 --> 24:28.290
I was weaned on rattlesnake blood!

24:28.377 --> 24:32.370
My mammy was a wolf,
and my pa was a gore grizzly!

25:47.617 --> 25:50.211
- $3.
- $3?

25:50.817 --> 25:55.572
God damn it, Fontenelle, you know that
this beaver's worth a heap more than $3.

25:55.657 --> 25:58.694
- This here is prime fur.
- $3.

25:59.377 --> 26:01.811
This here's a $5 plew if there ever was one.

26:01.897 --> 26:04.889
$3 seems fair enough... What are you doing?

26:04.977 --> 26:07.366
$3. I don't go no higher.

26:07.857 --> 26:11.452
You got buffalo robes?
I give you $20 apiece for them.

26:11.537 --> 26:15.132
I never thought I'd see the day
when buffalo brought more than beaver.

26:15.217 --> 26:19.768
You're robbing him blind, Fontenelle.
I never traded cutthroat like that.

26:20.817 --> 26:22.773
Take it while you can, boys.

26:22.857 --> 26:25.894
Next year you may not be able
to sell beaver at all.

26:25.977 --> 26:29.287
The way things are going,
this may be your last rendezvous.

26:29.377 --> 26:31.288
- What d'you mean?
- Silk.

26:32.537 --> 26:35.097
- What's that?
- Silk hats.

26:35.177 --> 26:37.566
They're not making them
out of beaver no more, Bill.

26:37.657 --> 26:40.046
Silk's the fashion now in London.

26:55.857 --> 26:58.371
A heap of fat meat can't shine forever.

26:59.217 --> 27:02.573
- I seen it coming.
- Beaver'll shine again, Henry.

27:02.657 --> 27:04.887
Actually, it seems reasonable
that if there's no demand...

27:04.977 --> 27:08.049
Silk. What the hell is silk?

27:08.137 --> 27:12.096
Don't you know nothing?
Silk. Made out of worms.

27:16.177 --> 27:19.692
Injuns coming! Injuns coming!

27:19.777 --> 27:21.893
- Asshole. Shit.
- Blackfeet.

27:21.977 --> 27:24.616
Blackfeet? They found us.

27:27.617 --> 27:30.927
No, them are Crow, for Christ's sake.
Ain't we learned you nothing?

27:31.017 --> 27:33.167
That's Iron Belly's village.

27:34.057 --> 27:36.651
Sure do make a spectacle, don't they?

27:39.977 --> 27:41.615
Who in goddamn is that?

27:42.777 --> 27:46.975
God damn, that's Medicine Wolf!
He come west with me in '23.

27:47.057 --> 27:50.891
We raised hell
from South Forks to Three Pass, we did.

27:55.577 --> 27:56.976
Hey, Medicine Wolf!

28:12.577 --> 28:14.090
Let me through there.

28:15.817 --> 28:18.047
No. Come on, let me through. Here.

28:18.377 --> 28:20.971
Let him through! Let him through!
Let him through!

28:24.697 --> 28:26.927
Medicine Wolf, how the hell are you?

28:28.017 --> 28:29.291
God damn!

28:29.937 --> 28:32.246
Here, old horse, have a drink.

28:37.857 --> 28:39.529
God damn!

29:08.457 --> 29:11.096
Mean as if he had a red-hot poker
up his asshole.

29:11.177 --> 29:14.374
- Well, listen.
- I'm a mad dog!

29:21.457 --> 29:23.652
Maybe Iron Belly help you.

29:23.737 --> 29:26.205
He knows the beaver like his own children.

29:26.897 --> 29:29.570
Christ, I thought he was dead.

29:29.657 --> 29:32.854
He outlive seven squaws.
Last winter he had a son.

29:33.417 --> 29:36.295
- Say, what the hell is that stuff?
- Kinnikinnick.

29:36.377 --> 29:39.449
- It tastes like buffalo shit.
- It is.

29:47.937 --> 29:50.132
- You should've heard him howl!
- Oh, that's good!

29:50.217 --> 29:53.095
- I don't care if it's true or not!
- Iron Belly?

29:59.657 --> 30:03.013
Iron Belly, it's me, Tyler.

30:04.177 --> 30:08.250
- How the hell old is he?
- 110.

30:11.257 --> 30:12.406
Look at that.

30:13.257 --> 30:14.770
That's Spanish armour.

30:19.017 --> 30:20.132
Iron Belly.

30:21.937 --> 30:24.656
Iron Belly, it's Bill Tyler.

30:28.177 --> 30:31.487
- Bill Tyler?
- Yeah. It's me.

30:32.977 --> 30:35.286
- Bill Tyler?
- The same.

30:36.457 --> 30:39.130
I thought you were dead.

30:44.057 --> 30:47.732
He Who Runs With the Wind,
speak your heart.

30:49.657 --> 30:52.774
Beaver's getting mighty scarce, Iron Belly.

30:53.937 --> 30:56.610
That damn Fontenelle's paying
next to nothing for the plews.

30:56.697 --> 30:59.370
- Ought to fight him.
- Outfits are going sky-high.

30:59.457 --> 31:04.292
Vermilion and beads and scalping knives
and such are mighty dear these days.

31:07.977 --> 31:10.207
Some say fur is down for good...

31:11.137 --> 31:12.934
...beaver won't never shine again.

31:13.017 --> 31:15.133
I am old, Bill Tyler.

31:15.657 --> 31:18.933
Beaver gone. Soon I gone, too.

31:19.017 --> 31:22.771
Damn it, Iron Belly,
it can't all be trapped out.

31:24.457 --> 31:27.813
In the mountains of the River of Wind...

31:28.937 --> 31:30.336
...there is a valley.

31:30.577 --> 31:32.533
The Wind River Range?

31:32.617 --> 31:35.177
It's the land of our enemies, the Blackfeet.

31:35.257 --> 31:38.932
Their hearts are bad,
their eyes red with blood.

31:39.537 --> 31:41.926
And it's chock-full of beaver, ain't it?

31:43.657 --> 31:44.976
- Ain't it?
- No.

31:45.057 --> 31:46.206
Has to be.

31:46.577 --> 31:48.852
Blackfeet been keeping
everybody out of there for years.

31:48.937 --> 31:49.926
It must be so full of beaver...

31:50.017 --> 31:52.212
...you don't even have to trap them,
just club them on the bank.

31:52.297 --> 31:53.412
Sure.

31:53.737 --> 31:54.772
Iron Belly.

31:54.857 --> 31:57.849
Higher in the mountains there is a valley.

31:57.937 --> 32:02.488
It is guarded fiercely by the Blackfeet
for there are beaver there...

32:02.977 --> 32:05.537
...as many as the stars in the sky.

32:05.617 --> 32:07.289
You said that already.

32:07.377 --> 32:11.211
Wind Rivers is a big range.
Can you narrow it down some?

32:11.297 --> 32:13.015
I have no more words.

32:17.097 --> 32:18.212
Iron Belly.

32:20.297 --> 32:23.812
You will know when you find it.

32:45.857 --> 32:47.893
Damn your eyes, Running Moon.

32:48.857 --> 32:51.735
I left you possibles to get you home,
didn't I?

33:00.737 --> 33:02.170
Well, damn it!

33:04.697 --> 33:08.246
<i>Voil�!</i> You're sober now,
huh, Billy Tyler?

33:08.777 --> 33:10.608
Sure you can take her?

33:11.497 --> 33:14.534
Better watch out, Billy,
she's gonna lift your hair!

33:17.337 --> 33:20.170
- What'd you do that for?
- You lied to me!

33:20.257 --> 33:23.886
- You said you'd go when I asked you.
- But you have not said so.

33:23.977 --> 33:26.650
Running Moon, why don't you go home?

33:26.737 --> 33:28.250
I have no home.

33:28.337 --> 33:30.009
Oh, for Christ's sake!

33:30.097 --> 33:33.089
It is the custom of my people.
I go with you.

33:33.177 --> 33:37.170
Tribal custom? <i>Sacr�e dame!</i>
She's <i>tr�s</i> pumpkin, Billy Tyler.

33:37.257 --> 33:40.329
I never heard of no such tribal custom.

33:40.697 --> 33:43.131
If Tyler does not want the squaw...

33:43.217 --> 33:45.094
...I take the squaw.

33:45.177 --> 33:47.133
That's my tribal custom. Huh?

33:49.577 --> 33:51.966
What d'you wanna latch on to me for?

33:52.057 --> 33:53.888
I have nowhere to go.

33:54.137 --> 33:57.573
Hey, Tyler,
you give me that Crow of a bitch, huh?

33:57.657 --> 34:00.376
I'm not afraid of her. She won't hurt me.

34:04.737 --> 34:06.011
Excuse me.

34:06.777 --> 34:08.654
You don't wanna get him riled, froggy.

34:08.737 --> 34:11.205
He might have you for lunch. There you go.

34:19.857 --> 34:22.974
Well, I thank you.

34:24.456 --> 34:25.889
Why don't you learn trapping?

34:25.976 --> 34:30.652
Take up a decent trade, instead of
latching on to that damn wagon string.

34:30.737 --> 34:32.534
Train. Wagon train.

34:33.137 --> 34:34.172
Come on.

34:34.857 --> 34:37.166
We're going clear to Oregon, Mr Tyler.

34:37.257 --> 34:39.407
You won't get past the Snake!

34:40.257 --> 34:42.725
You can't get wagons
through the mountains!

34:43.697 --> 34:45.369
Damn pilgrim!

34:46.337 --> 34:47.690
Dumb asshole.

35:31.057 --> 35:32.934
Reckon you're gonna keep her?

35:33.897 --> 35:35.569
You reckon I got any choice?

35:35.657 --> 35:38.535
I don't know. Got sand in her, she does.

35:39.297 --> 35:40.446
Hell.

35:42.537 --> 35:44.255
Kicked the shit out of you.

35:44.737 --> 35:47.376
Christ. Sand.

36:28.217 --> 36:31.653
You ain't gonna catch nothing up here
except rheumatism, Tyler.

36:32.737 --> 36:36.252
We'd best move on in the morning.
This sure Lord ain't the place.

36:37.457 --> 36:41.245
Yes, sir,
whole valley swarming with beaver...

36:41.337 --> 36:42.690
...fighting to get into your trap.

36:42.777 --> 36:45.052
- "Take me, take me," they say.
- God damn it, Henry.

36:45.137 --> 36:48.766
A place like that ain't gonna be
easy to find, it stands to reason.

36:50.497 --> 36:51.850
You see any sign?

36:52.697 --> 36:54.574
Sure as shit ain't no sign of beaver.

36:54.657 --> 36:56.454
I don't mean beaver sign.

36:57.337 --> 37:00.773
Oh, maybe. I can smell Blackfoot a mile off.

37:00.857 --> 37:02.575
No offence, Running Moon.

37:02.657 --> 37:05.012
This child smells Blackfoot, too.

37:05.097 --> 37:08.407
Nothing particular, just a feeling.

37:08.497 --> 37:10.488
My people come here many times.

37:11.537 --> 37:14.290
- You've been here before?
- Many times.

37:16.457 --> 37:19.176
- Why in the hell didn't you say so?
- You did not ask.

37:19.257 --> 37:21.896
You know about this valley
all full of beaver?

37:21.977 --> 37:24.730
My people kept it a secret
from the other tribes.

37:25.417 --> 37:29.012
They say it was rich in fur,
thick and sleek.

37:29.777 --> 37:32.894
- Where in the hell is it?
- I don't know. I don't remember.

37:32.977 --> 37:34.171
What do you mean, you don't remember?

37:34.257 --> 37:36.771
- You was raised here, for Christ's sake...
- Henry!

37:36.857 --> 37:38.529
She says she don't know.

37:41.457 --> 37:42.970
It's only a legend.

37:45.337 --> 37:46.565
Well...

39:01.337 --> 39:04.409
- Where you been?
- Trapping.

39:06.417 --> 39:09.648
- Any Injun sign?
- Oh, some.

39:11.937 --> 39:15.486
- Do you reckon they'll be back?
- Not the ones that tangled with me.

39:15.577 --> 39:16.851
You look all tuckered out, Bill.

39:16.937 --> 39:18.893
I think you're getting too old
for the mountains.

39:18.977 --> 39:22.094
- Losing your wind.
- Could be, Henry.

39:24.497 --> 39:25.771
Could be.

40:04.697 --> 40:05.812
Injuns!

40:07.057 --> 40:08.775
Injuns, God damn it!

40:16.617 --> 40:19.051
Damn Blackfoot stealing my mules.

40:19.137 --> 40:21.367
If I was you, I'd let them keep them.

40:21.817 --> 40:24.411
Anyways, you was guarding the stock.

40:24.497 --> 40:26.727
They snuck up on me, God damn it.

40:26.817 --> 40:29.092
That's what Injuns do for a living.

40:33.257 --> 40:34.531
Heavy Eagle.

40:35.417 --> 40:37.772
- Him?
- No.

40:40.577 --> 40:42.215
Do you reckon he saw you?

40:56.057 --> 40:57.934
Looks like they crossed here.

40:58.497 --> 41:00.453
Must be halfway to Three Forks.

42:00.057 --> 42:01.206
Running Moon!

42:07.577 --> 42:08.930
Running...

42:14.737 --> 42:16.534
I thought you'd gone under.

42:16.617 --> 42:19.973
Heavy Eagle will hunt us.
His blood burns. He will...

42:21.137 --> 42:22.570
Where's Frapp?

44:57.337 --> 44:58.690
Where's my shirt?

45:02.017 --> 45:06.454
Damn it. Running Moon, where's my shirt?
You promised to mend it.

45:08.657 --> 45:11.091
Damn thing's plumb wore out anyways.

45:15.857 --> 45:17.131
Well, what'd...

45:21.697 --> 45:23.130
Well, now, then.

45:27.417 --> 45:28.930
That shines. That...

45:34.097 --> 45:35.815
That truly shines.

47:28.617 --> 47:31.814
The woman is of our nation. She's mine.

47:33.137 --> 47:35.412
- Go on, get!
- I stay with you.

47:35.537 --> 47:38.290
- You'll go under if you do.
- I stay!

48:35.177 --> 48:36.735
Running Moon!

48:40.337 --> 48:41.372
Running...

49:03.097 --> 49:04.894
Where's Running Moon?

49:05.177 --> 49:07.771
Is the long knife a swift runner?

49:08.457 --> 49:10.288
What do you mean, run?

49:10.377 --> 49:12.572
It was not for me to decide.

49:13.657 --> 49:16.091
The council of elders are like squaws.

49:16.537 --> 49:19.495
The white man's medicine makes us weak.

49:24.977 --> 49:27.445
We die like flies at Fort McKenzie.

49:27.977 --> 49:29.330
You mean the pox?

49:29.537 --> 49:33.246
We trade at the fort,
and our faces rot and fall off.

49:33.817 --> 49:36.172
Even the wolves will not touch us.

49:47.017 --> 49:51.169
This is strange, evil medicine.

49:54.057 --> 49:56.013
And we can do nothing about it.

49:57.897 --> 49:59.649
But you and I are the same.

50:01.817 --> 50:04.615
A few passing suns will see us no more.

50:05.897 --> 50:09.606
Our bones will bleach in the sun
with the bones of the buffalo.

50:09.977 --> 50:11.729
But we shall be remembered.

50:15.657 --> 50:17.932
Tomorrow, you'll see your last sunrise.

50:18.017 --> 50:19.575
Where is Running Moon?

50:24.177 --> 50:25.929
She is dead.

51:10.097 --> 51:11.212
Run.

54:24.297 --> 54:25.935
He cannot be found.

59:09.177 --> 59:11.133
You hunt for him still?

59:13.097 --> 59:16.055
No man can live in that water.
Not the Gros Ventre.

59:17.297 --> 59:19.811
- He is dead.
- I survived.

59:21.937 --> 59:23.575
When his scalp...

59:24.497 --> 59:26.328
...hangs from my lodge...

59:26.577 --> 59:29.569
...when his head sits on my spear...

59:31.817 --> 59:33.455
...then he will be dead.

59:33.537 --> 59:35.175
It will be winter soon.

59:37.417 --> 59:39.453
Running Moon, go. Bring us wood.

59:48.697 --> 59:50.255
We have little to eat.

59:51.017 --> 59:52.689
We must move the village.

59:53.617 --> 59:56.927
When the snow fall, it will hide his tracks.

59:57.577 --> 59:58.976
We need no tracks.

59:59.177 --> 01:00:01.771
We will move the village
before the snow come.

01:00:03.657 --> 01:00:05.454
Then we will hunt.

01:00:10.377 --> 01:00:13.175
There is only one place
he can survive the winter.

01:00:14.937 --> 01:00:17.246
In the village of Iron Belly, the Crow.

01:00:25.177 --> 01:00:26.292
Git!

01:00:28.617 --> 01:00:29.686
Go on!

01:02:25.097 --> 01:02:27.895
- You black your face for a hunt?
- For this hunt.

01:04:04.177 --> 01:04:05.292
Christ.

01:05:27.497 --> 01:05:28.725
I am dying.

01:05:29.777 --> 01:05:31.130
There is no more.

01:05:32.897 --> 01:05:34.216
I am hungry, too.

01:05:35.897 --> 01:05:37.774
I am Medicine Wolf.

01:05:38.857 --> 01:05:41.894
I will not die like a slave.

01:05:42.097 --> 01:05:43.450
Medicine Wolf?

01:05:44.817 --> 01:05:48.093
You know Bill Tyler? He spoke of you.

01:05:52.457 --> 01:05:54.925
- Bill Tyler is my friend.
- When did you see him?

01:05:55.017 --> 01:05:58.566
- Was he not in your village?
- No.

01:05:58.657 --> 01:06:01.251
He escaped from Heavy Eagle
before the winter.

01:06:02.697 --> 01:06:04.449
- Maybe he go under.
- No.

01:06:06.217 --> 01:06:07.969
I know that he's alive.

01:06:08.857 --> 01:06:10.256
Maybe he go north.

01:06:11.217 --> 01:06:12.696
Yellowstone country.

01:06:13.897 --> 01:06:17.207
Many trappers winter on the Madison River.

01:06:19.777 --> 01:06:21.290
I am Tyler's woman.

01:06:23.417 --> 01:06:24.975
I will bring you more.

01:07:04.177 --> 01:07:06.088
What the hell took you, Tyler?

01:07:06.857 --> 01:07:07.926
Henry?

01:07:08.297 --> 01:07:10.811
Sit your ass down and have a cup of coffee.

01:07:22.417 --> 01:07:23.896
Oh, that's good, man.

01:07:25.617 --> 01:07:27.050
That's mighty good.

01:07:28.217 --> 01:07:29.616
Look here, Henry.

01:07:30.497 --> 01:07:32.055
If I'd a knowed...

01:07:32.577 --> 01:07:34.533
You was laying there scalped.

01:07:35.377 --> 01:07:37.493
If I'd a knowed you weren't dead...

01:07:37.577 --> 01:07:39.693
I never would've left you, not for nothing.

01:07:39.777 --> 01:07:43.531
You don't have to tell me that,
for Christ's sake. I know that.

01:07:44.137 --> 01:07:45.968
Well, I was laying there.

01:07:46.257 --> 01:07:48.134
Come to all by my lonesome.

01:07:49.057 --> 01:07:51.855
Them Blackfeet was so busy
taking off after you...

01:07:52.217 --> 01:07:54.412
...they even forgot to take my rifle.

01:07:55.257 --> 01:07:57.612
I got back to camp, I seen you was gone.

01:07:57.857 --> 01:07:59.927
Just walked the hell out of there.

01:08:00.777 --> 01:08:04.087
Takes a lot more than a scalping knife
to put this child under.

01:08:04.177 --> 01:08:06.133
It sure must've smarted some, though.

01:08:06.217 --> 01:08:08.492
Well, I guess.

01:08:11.937 --> 01:08:13.575
Ain't that the shits?

01:08:15.577 --> 01:08:18.011
I tell you, it felt mighty queersome.

01:08:19.657 --> 01:08:21.932
Hey, where in the hell's Running Moon?

01:08:24.096 --> 01:08:25.814
She's gone under, Henry...

01:08:28.136 --> 01:08:30.252
...when Heavy Eagle stove her head in.

01:08:30.697 --> 01:08:31.925
Oh, shit.

01:08:33.737 --> 01:08:35.216
God damn!

01:08:36.537 --> 01:08:38.209
She was some pumpkin, too.

01:08:38.537 --> 01:08:39.652
Well...

01:08:40.296 --> 01:08:43.015
Say, you ever find that valley?

01:08:43.096 --> 01:08:45.406
The one that's
always swarming with the beavers?

01:08:45.497 --> 01:08:49.410
Where they run up on the banks
and fight one another to get in your trap?

01:08:50.817 --> 01:08:53.729
Hollering, "Take me, Bill Tyler! Take me!"

01:08:55.577 --> 01:08:58.488
Beaver, many as stars in the sky.

01:09:18.617 --> 01:09:21.336
- There's an old horse outside.
- What?

01:09:21.417 --> 01:09:22.930
There's an old horse outside.

01:09:23.017 --> 01:09:26.214
You are only a slave.
They will not go after you.

01:09:37.337 --> 01:09:39.850
Find Tyler. Tell him I wait.

01:09:41.417 --> 01:09:42.452
Go.

01:10:05.737 --> 01:10:07.807
Before I got there, he'd burnt it out.

01:10:07.897 --> 01:10:11.094
Killed the old man,
and the squaws and the young ones, too.

01:10:11.497 --> 01:10:14.295
Left me between a rock and a hard place.

01:10:15.257 --> 01:10:19.455
All I could do was try for the Flathead
countries, see if they'd take me in.

01:10:20.097 --> 01:10:22.691
I worked across the Yellowstone.

01:10:24.497 --> 01:10:28.331
Yeah, you got the hair of the bear on you,
Tyler, that's for damn sure.

01:10:28.457 --> 01:10:30.766
I seed the back door to hell, Henry.

01:10:32.057 --> 01:10:34.969
Yeah, look at her. There she is.

01:10:36.737 --> 01:10:38.853
You little rascal. Go on, get out.

01:10:39.817 --> 01:10:41.728
Traded a good pinto for her.

01:10:41.817 --> 01:10:43.455
Course, I stole him from her pappy first.

01:10:43.537 --> 01:10:46.449
The old son of a bitch got so goddamn
many horses, he didn't recognise his own...

01:10:46.537 --> 01:10:48.095
...when I brung him back.

01:10:48.457 --> 01:10:49.890
She don't know a damn word of English...

01:10:49.977 --> 01:10:53.174
...but she can be mighty comforting
on a night like this one.

01:10:53.857 --> 01:10:55.575
I do miss my mules, though.

01:10:56.577 --> 01:10:59.649
Hey, Tyler, where's your squaw?

01:11:03.377 --> 01:11:05.937
Oh, I know. You get too old, huh?

01:11:08.777 --> 01:11:12.087
Gros Ventre bitch. Big melons.

01:11:12.777 --> 01:11:14.415
What'd you pay for her?

01:11:16.297 --> 01:11:18.174
I bet she hump you good, huh?

01:11:18.297 --> 01:11:20.572
Shut up, shit for brains.

01:11:21.217 --> 01:11:22.730
I like red meat, huh?

01:11:22.817 --> 01:11:26.127
I said, shut up,
you goddamn pork-eating frog turd!

01:11:28.217 --> 01:11:31.732
"I said, shut up. I said, shut up," huh?

01:11:32.857 --> 01:11:35.530
I can't stand that nasty-talking bastard.

01:11:40.657 --> 01:11:43.091
You know, it's goddamn lonesome out here.

01:11:43.297 --> 01:11:46.289
It took you 20 years
to figure that one out, huh?

01:11:47.337 --> 01:11:49.646
I'm getting long in the tooth for this.

01:12:05.417 --> 01:12:08.773
- That ain't a elk.
- I reckon not.

01:12:15.857 --> 01:12:18.007
No presents now, Tyler, you hear?

01:12:18.417 --> 01:12:19.930
No damn meat either.

01:12:26.857 --> 01:12:30.372
Watch yourself, Bill, God damn it.
He's liable to have the pox.

01:12:31.777 --> 01:12:33.369
He ain't got the pox.

01:12:33.457 --> 01:12:37.132
The whole tribe caught it
over to Port Union last fall, God damn it.

01:12:37.497 --> 01:12:38.725
What the hell!

01:12:38.897 --> 01:12:41.969
- I am Medicine Wolf.
- I know who you are, damn it.

01:12:42.177 --> 01:12:43.292
What happened?

01:12:43.377 --> 01:12:46.972
Medicine Wolf hunting. They take prisoner.

01:12:48.337 --> 01:12:49.531
All die.

01:12:51.617 --> 01:12:53.096
- Hungry.
- Yeah...

01:12:53.217 --> 01:12:56.095
...you'll eat just as soon as
we get you back to camp.

01:12:56.577 --> 01:12:58.010
How'd you get away?

01:13:00.217 --> 01:13:01.411
Running Moon.

01:13:01.857 --> 01:13:04.212
- What?
- Running Moon.

01:13:04.297 --> 01:13:08.654
She help Medicine Wolf. Give horse.

01:13:09.697 --> 01:13:11.335
- She says...
- She's alive?

01:13:11.417 --> 01:13:14.295
...she waits.

01:13:17.617 --> 01:13:20.927
What'd he say? What'd he say?

01:13:22.657 --> 01:13:24.136
He says he's hungry.

01:13:26.017 --> 01:13:27.086
God.

01:13:27.177 --> 01:13:30.408
For Christ's sakes,
tell him we ain't got no meat to spare.

01:13:30.817 --> 01:13:34.651
We can't go feeding every starving-ass
Indian comes wandering into...

01:13:36.937 --> 01:13:38.256
Oh, Jesus.

01:13:46.977 --> 01:13:49.207
I don't reckon he'll eat much, Henry.

01:13:51.497 --> 01:13:54.250
You fellers ever find that valley
you was hunting?

01:13:54.337 --> 01:13:56.407
The one Iron Belly told you about?

01:13:56.897 --> 01:13:58.535
There ain't no valley, Joe.

01:13:58.617 --> 01:14:02.610
- I hear Iron Belly tell you different.
- Iron Belly's an old man.

01:14:02.697 --> 01:14:06.007
He was just yarning me.
It didn't make no never mind to him.

01:14:06.217 --> 01:14:08.412
Maybe he tell you the truth.

01:14:08.857 --> 01:14:11.007
Which way might you be heading,
come break-up?

01:14:11.097 --> 01:14:12.086
North.

01:14:12.177 --> 01:14:15.294
Drop on over Kicking Horse Pass,
trap the wolf.

01:14:15.737 --> 01:14:17.295
Maybe the Peace River.

01:14:18.257 --> 01:14:19.895
It's British territory.

01:14:20.177 --> 01:14:24.056
Hudson's Bay ain't gonna be too happy
to hear you trapping their ground.

01:14:24.337 --> 01:14:28.694
If the Blackfeet couldn't lift my hair, I
reckon I can stay ahead of the Britishers.

01:14:29.777 --> 01:14:31.005
Coyotes?

01:14:43.697 --> 01:14:46.165
Remember the first time we saw the Tetons?

01:14:46.617 --> 01:14:50.007
Standing tall and white
as a woman's breast.

01:14:50.377 --> 01:14:52.288
Whole country so new it made a man think...

01:14:52.377 --> 01:14:55.210
...he was the first one to set foot on it.

01:14:55.857 --> 01:14:59.213
You could walk for a year
in any direction with just your rifle.

01:14:59.297 --> 01:15:02.528
Live good and easy.
Never say "sir" to nobody.

01:15:09.177 --> 01:15:11.850
- What made you change your mind?
- What do you mean by that?

01:15:11.937 --> 01:15:16.135
I mean, Running Moon ain't dead, is she?
Well, no more than I am.

01:15:16.937 --> 01:15:20.293
So I don't reckon
you're heading for no Peace River, are you?

01:15:23.217 --> 01:15:24.616
No, she ain't dead.

01:15:25.737 --> 01:15:27.887
Bastard Heavy Eagle lied to me.

01:15:30.297 --> 01:15:33.175
- There ain't no valley, Henry.
- I wasn't thinking about that.

01:15:33.257 --> 01:15:35.168
There ain't no beaver
up there, God damn it!

01:15:35.257 --> 01:15:39.489
I just thought you might need some help
stealing Running Moon back, that's all.

01:15:40.657 --> 01:15:42.170
I don't need no help.

01:15:44.377 --> 01:15:46.333
Don't reckon I need any help.

01:15:47.657 --> 01:15:50.535
Heavy Eagle might have
something to say about that.

01:15:50.657 --> 01:15:51.851
Maybe.

01:15:52.737 --> 01:15:55.968
Well, I was only trying to help you,
you contrary old fart.

01:15:57.217 --> 01:15:58.366
I know it.

01:16:03.377 --> 01:16:04.730
Good luck to you.

01:16:07.097 --> 01:16:08.928
Good luck to you, too, Henry.

01:17:01.257 --> 01:17:03.532
Well, somebody's gotta look after you.

01:17:04.977 --> 01:17:06.808
What happened to your squaw?

01:17:07.457 --> 01:17:10.210
I traded her back to her pappy
for the pinto.

01:17:11.857 --> 01:17:13.051
You ain't riding it.

01:17:13.137 --> 01:17:16.812
The old fart stole him back again,
goddamn thieving redskin.

01:17:38.217 --> 01:17:39.366
Tyler.

01:17:42.097 --> 01:17:44.327
Didn't figure on meeting you two up here.

01:17:44.417 --> 01:17:46.692
Wind River's a long ways
from Kicking Horse Pass.

01:17:46.777 --> 01:17:48.369
I changed my mind.

01:17:51.097 --> 01:17:52.610
Yeah, I can see that.

01:17:56.897 --> 01:17:59.695
You're free trappers.
You hunt where you want.

01:18:00.697 --> 01:18:03.336
But I'm telling you,
there ain't no valley up here...

01:18:03.417 --> 01:18:04.850
...and there ain't no beaver.

01:18:04.937 --> 01:18:07.531
No? So why you here, then?

01:18:18.097 --> 01:18:20.930
You boys are on your own hook.
Stay out of my way.

01:18:26.617 --> 01:18:27.766
Why...

01:18:33.497 --> 01:18:35.135
...you forsake your people?

01:18:37.417 --> 01:18:38.770
I have no people.

01:18:40.817 --> 01:18:42.250
I am the people.

01:18:46.097 --> 01:18:48.133
They will not die while I live.

01:18:55.857 --> 01:18:58.166
You cannot leave, Running Moon.

01:19:02.777 --> 01:19:04.051
He will come...

01:19:06.457 --> 01:19:07.606
...as I did.

01:19:12.217 --> 01:19:13.570
And he will die.

01:19:35.097 --> 01:19:36.815
That wasn't here this morning.

01:19:36.897 --> 01:19:38.410
Two, three hours old.

01:19:38.497 --> 01:19:40.647
Six, seven of them. War party.

01:19:41.537 --> 01:19:43.573
Don't try to teach me my business, Henry.

01:19:43.657 --> 01:19:45.648
Travelling too fast for hunters.

01:19:46.217 --> 01:19:47.730
Maybe they was in a hurry.

01:19:47.817 --> 01:19:50.729
Where the hell do you think they're going?
Church social?

01:19:50.817 --> 01:19:54.332
You'd best get back on to camp,
check up on them two chichacos.

01:19:54.417 --> 01:19:56.055
I'll scout around some.

01:20:16.737 --> 01:20:19.809
That crap Walker don't come in by now,
he don't come in.

01:20:20.737 --> 01:20:23.376
Quit worrying.
You've been out longer yourself.

01:20:27.937 --> 01:20:30.371
<i>Sacr�e merde!</i>
I think you one goddamn Injun.

01:20:31.297 --> 01:20:33.367
If I was an Injun, you'd be dead.

01:20:36.977 --> 01:20:39.537
- I thought you was hunting with Walker.
<i>- Oui?</i>

01:20:45.577 --> 01:20:49.855
- You bury him.
- Bullshit! You'll kill us all, Tyler.

01:20:52.657 --> 01:20:56.445
And then take all the beaver for yourself!
Maybe you kill my friend.

01:20:56.817 --> 01:21:00.526
- Then maybe you kill me, huh?
- That ain't a bad idea, frog ass.

01:21:00.617 --> 01:21:01.686
<i>Sale con!</i>

01:21:04.737 --> 01:21:08.173
I seen the village, Henry.
I got close enough to spit on it.

01:21:08.257 --> 01:21:09.849
Running Moon up there?

01:21:09.937 --> 01:21:12.929
It's near empty.
The braves are out hunting us.

01:21:13.017 --> 01:21:15.690
- Only a bunch of old men and boys...
- Is Running Moon up there?

01:21:15.777 --> 01:21:17.654
- Sure, she's there.
- Well?

01:21:18.577 --> 01:21:21.489
- Figured how to get her out of there?
- Walk in and take her.

01:21:21.577 --> 01:21:24.296
Take her? Christ's sakes, Tyler, take her?

01:21:24.377 --> 01:21:26.368
They'll be just down to the end
of that valley.

01:21:26.457 --> 01:21:29.529
We ride into the valley from the east,
then we work up a side canyon.

01:21:29.617 --> 01:21:32.654
I know they're watching us all the time,
so I'm certain they'll go after us.

01:21:32.737 --> 01:21:35.535
Go after us? You tetched?
Go after... Jesus Christ.

01:21:35.617 --> 01:21:39.132
Once we draw off Heavy Eagle and his boys,
we put the sneak on them.

01:21:39.217 --> 01:21:40.855
We work past them in the thick country...

01:21:40.937 --> 01:21:43.167
...and walk into that village
as slick as you please.

01:21:43.257 --> 01:21:45.088
Who in the hell
d'you think you're messing with?

01:21:45.177 --> 01:21:47.645
- Them boys kill for a living, you know?
- No!

01:21:47.737 --> 01:21:51.207
By the time they get wind of where
we're at, we'll be long gone.

01:21:54.497 --> 01:21:56.215
Hey, wake up, you old fart.

01:22:02.657 --> 01:22:04.488
La Bont lit out on us, did he?

01:22:04.577 --> 01:22:07.933
Yeah, took the pack stock with him, too.
Asshole.

01:22:10.297 --> 01:22:12.288
Well, you was guarding the horses.

01:22:12.377 --> 01:22:14.652
The hell you say!
It was your turn, God damn it!

01:22:14.737 --> 01:22:18.013
My turn? My turn? You old bastard!

01:22:18.297 --> 01:22:20.572
Well, it's never your turn
to guard the goddamn horses!

01:22:20.657 --> 01:22:22.568
- Every goddamn time we lose the horses...
- Oh, shut up!

01:22:22.657 --> 01:22:25.046
...it's my turn to guard them, ain't it?

01:22:26.937 --> 01:22:29.246
Yeah? Well, what about the time
the Rees snuck off...

01:22:29.337 --> 01:22:31.976
...with old Gabe's mules
down on the Bighorn, huh?

01:22:32.737 --> 01:22:35.092
- You was guarding the stock.
- I was guarding the stock?

01:22:35.177 --> 01:22:37.247
Bullshit I was guarding the stock!

01:22:37.937 --> 01:22:39.848
What about that time
down on the Seedskadee...

01:22:39.937 --> 01:22:41.336
...when the Sioux jumped your ass, huh?

01:22:41.417 --> 01:22:44.136
- You was...
- What the hell?

01:22:44.257 --> 01:22:45.406
Oh, balls.

01:22:46.337 --> 01:22:47.850
He's leading them right back to us!

01:22:47.937 --> 01:22:50.326
Asshole!

01:22:52.417 --> 01:22:53.896
Damn. They nearly got me.

01:22:53.977 --> 01:22:55.456
Where the hell's my horses?

01:22:55.537 --> 01:22:57.573
What do you think?
The goddamn Indians get them.

01:22:57.657 --> 01:22:59.329
What the hell'd you come back here for...

01:22:59.417 --> 01:23:03.615
...you goddamn ignorant,
foreign goddamn shithead frog?

01:23:14.337 --> 01:23:17.932
We sure put the sneak on them.
Yes, sir. Sure fooled them.

01:23:23.297 --> 01:23:25.174
Nobody guarding this village.

01:23:28.537 --> 01:23:29.970
Yes, sirree.

01:23:30.577 --> 01:23:32.135
All we got to do is...

01:23:32.457 --> 01:23:34.129
...give them the slip
in the thick country...

01:23:34.217 --> 01:23:37.527
...and then whip right up there
and rescue good old Running Moon...

01:23:37.617 --> 01:23:39.175
slick as you please.

01:23:39.657 --> 01:23:41.056
You got any ideas?

01:23:41.897 --> 01:23:44.855
Well, maybe if we can hold them off
till dark...

01:23:46.577 --> 01:23:50.013
...get our asses out of here
and up to that village before sunup.

01:23:50.497 --> 01:23:53.489
'Cause you know Heavy Eagle ain't gonna
try to butcher us until daybreak.

01:23:53.577 --> 01:23:56.091
By then,
we could be halfway to Yellowstone.

01:23:56.297 --> 01:23:59.095
What makes you think
he won't butcher us at night?

01:23:59.337 --> 01:24:01.931
Blackfeet don't fight at night.
You know that.

01:24:02.417 --> 01:24:06.296
Henry, you ain't got the brains
God give geese.

01:24:17.937 --> 01:24:21.054
Hey, what d'you think?
Maybe we make deal?

01:24:21.417 --> 01:24:23.806
We give them horses, they let us go, no?

01:24:27.617 --> 01:24:29.448
I've been down that trail before.

01:24:29.537 --> 01:24:31.812
He wants parley. We give it to him, no?

01:24:32.297 --> 01:24:35.050
You suit yourself.
I got nothing to say to him.

01:24:36.657 --> 01:24:40.616
- He's way out of range.
- I know it. I just don't like him.

01:25:30.137 --> 01:25:32.207
- Don't miss.
- I never miss.

01:25:46.897 --> 01:25:49.047
Say, Henry...

01:25:49.937 --> 01:25:53.452
...ain't no need for you
to fight your way into that village.

01:25:53.657 --> 01:25:55.932
- We could join up...
- I ever tell you about the time...

01:25:56.017 --> 01:25:59.089
...the Arapahos chased me up a canyon
over in the Big Lost?

01:25:59.497 --> 01:26:01.249
No. I reckon you're gonna tell me.

01:26:01.337 --> 01:26:04.056
Well, it was over on the Horse Prairie.

01:26:04.297 --> 01:26:06.970
This band of Arapahos
has been chasing me three days.

01:26:07.057 --> 01:26:10.493
So I seen this canyon. I figured, well,
I'll whip in there, and then I'll slip out.

01:26:10.577 --> 01:26:13.569
The trouble was that there was a way in,
but there weren't no way out at all.

01:26:13.657 --> 01:26:16.217
Nothing but cliffs half a mile high
all the way around.

01:26:16.297 --> 01:26:19.289
A whole damn tribe
of Blackfoot down there...

01:26:19.377 --> 01:26:21.607
...just madder than turpentine wildcats.

01:26:22.297 --> 01:26:24.970
So I holed up behind some rocks,
but that didn't do no good...

01:26:25.057 --> 01:26:27.890
...because they just kept on a-coming,
entire Sioux nation.

01:26:27.977 --> 01:26:31.287
Me out of powder, out of lead.
God damn, I was one scared nigger.

01:26:31.377 --> 01:26:34.449
- Thought you said they was Arapaho.
- No, God damn it! They was Pawnee.

01:26:34.537 --> 01:26:35.936
Well, what happened to you?

01:26:36.017 --> 01:26:38.292
- Well, I got killed, of course.
- You got killed, of course.

01:26:39.577 --> 01:26:42.489
Say, did you see anything of Heavy Eagle
after La Bont got killed?

01:26:42.577 --> 01:26:43.726
Reckon not.

01:27:23.137 --> 01:27:25.253
You're getting too old for Injun-fighting,
Henry.

01:27:25.337 --> 01:27:26.975
You're losing your wind.

01:27:29.017 --> 01:27:30.655
You call this fighting?

01:27:43.337 --> 01:27:44.565
Jesus.

01:27:45.497 --> 01:27:48.295
I told you,
you needed somebody to look after you.

01:27:48.617 --> 01:27:49.732
Now you...

01:27:50.737 --> 01:27:54.969
You just lay quiet there a spell,
and I'll have you out of here.

01:27:55.057 --> 01:27:58.493
Oh, bullshit. Going under, ain't I?

01:28:01.337 --> 01:28:02.736
Son of a bitch!

01:28:05.697 --> 01:28:08.848
Well, we trapped a heap, didn't we?

01:28:11.017 --> 01:28:15.408
The country was ours for the taking
and, by God, we reached out and took it.

01:28:16.657 --> 01:28:18.887
Yeah, them was shining times.

01:28:19.817 --> 01:28:22.092
You and Running Moon gotta move fast.

01:28:22.697 --> 01:28:24.733
Get the hell up in the high country.

01:28:24.817 --> 01:28:26.728
Injuns don't like it up there.

01:28:28.577 --> 01:28:32.206
- You can have my pack mule.
- You ain't got no pack mule.

01:28:32.817 --> 01:28:34.455
Look, don't talk so damn much.

01:28:34.537 --> 01:28:38.416
Oh, Christ's sakes, I'm bleeding to death.
I'm gonna talk all I damn want.

01:28:39.017 --> 01:28:41.770
Listen, you old son of a bitch.

01:28:42.097 --> 01:28:43.655
You tell me the truth.

01:28:44.537 --> 01:28:45.970
That valley's up there.

01:28:46.057 --> 01:28:47.934
You and Running Moon found it,
didn't you?

01:28:48.017 --> 01:28:50.326
It's up there, ain't it? Ain't it?

01:28:53.417 --> 01:28:54.532
Yeah, Henry.

01:28:59.497 --> 01:29:00.976
Yeah, it's up there.

01:29:02.537 --> 01:29:04.812
A whole valley full of prime beaver.

01:29:06.497 --> 01:29:09.375
A man could live easy the rest of his days.

01:29:10.057 --> 01:29:13.527
- Was they like stars in the sky?
- Yeah.

01:29:17.097 --> 01:29:21.249
Did they holler, "Take me, take me"?

01:29:22.897 --> 01:29:24.967
Like it was in the Ashley days...

01:29:26.417 --> 01:29:28.248
...when we was free trappers.

01:29:34.057 --> 01:29:35.456
Oh, God damn it.

01:29:40.937 --> 01:29:43.132
God damn you, Henry Frapp.
