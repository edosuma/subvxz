00:36.041 --> 00:38.166
- Your daughter is gorgeous.
- Bone structure.

00:39.542 --> 00:41.333
This is such
an interesting piece.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.667
Boner structure.

00:43.709 --> 00:47.625
Reminder, there's
sponge cake and/or cheeses
in the piano room.

00:47.667 --> 00:49.625
Ooh.
That sounds delightful.

00:49.667 --> 00:51.458
Okay, I've got
a good joke.

00:51.500 --> 00:54.458
What's the difference between
a golf ball and a G-spot?

00:58.125 --> 01:00.375
Uh, that's just
the setup, honey.

01:00.417 --> 01:02.709
A man will spend 20 minutes
looking for a golf ball.

01:04.792 --> 01:07.709
Because it's more important
to find a golf ball
than to please our wives!

01:10.083 --> 01:12.583
Looks like the health care bill
is mired in the Senate again.

01:12.625 --> 01:15.041
Oh, come on!

01:15.083 --> 01:17.583
I don't think our health care
system can be reformed.

01:17.625 --> 01:19.208
Oh, really? Why not?

01:19.250 --> 01:21.000
Uh-huh.

01:22.291 --> 01:24.250
Uh-huh, what?

01:24.291 --> 01:27.417
You caught me.

01:27.458 --> 01:31.000
I have no idea.
I just say stuff sometimes.

01:32.875 --> 01:35.041
Look, everyone.
Her dress is see-through!

01:35.083 --> 01:39.375
How come every time
we go to a party,
you push me in the pool?

01:39.417 --> 01:41.917
Everyone's always afraid
to be the first one in the pool.

01:41.959 --> 01:43.750
You're that girl.
You're the party starter!

01:43.792 --> 01:47.041
My purse tampons
were floating in the water!

01:47.083 --> 01:49.750
People were impressed
by how big they got.

01:49.792 --> 01:51.834
Francine embarrassed you
again, huh?

01:51.875 --> 01:54.083
Klaus, she's terrible
in social situations.

01:54.125 --> 01:55.834
She doesn't know when
to laugh at jokes,

01:55.875 --> 01:58.000
she talks about things
she doesn't know about.

01:58.041 --> 02:02.417
You know, Stan, she's the reason
you never get invited
to fancy events--

02:02.458 --> 02:05.583
- Like Bullock's cocktail parties.
- Exactly.

02:05.625 --> 02:08.750
Bullock always has dignitaries
and heads of state there.

02:08.792 --> 02:11.709
Like, I bet if I was married
to Helen Mirren,
we'd get invited.

02:11.750 --> 02:13.667
She'd wear
her silver mane up,

02:13.709 --> 02:16.083
showing off
that sophisticated neck.

02:16.125 --> 02:20.333
A bobby pin would fall out,
and a rebellious lock
would cascade down.

02:20.375 --> 02:25.000
I'd get in real close
and whisper, "You have
a loose hair, hellcat."

02:28.917 --> 02:31.500
Dudes! Vince Chung
is throwing a bonfire...

02:31.542 --> 02:33.417
beneath the water tower
tomorrow night.

02:33.458 --> 02:36.041
And get this,
anyone can come...

02:36.083 --> 02:39.500
as long as they
bring booze or girls!

02:39.542 --> 02:41.125
My sister's a girl.

02:41.166 --> 02:45.041
Yeah, but they have to be
prettier than Leelee Sobieski.

02:45.083 --> 02:48.500
Oh!
Then we shall gain our entry
with booze.

02:48.542 --> 02:51.834
A kid from Hebrew school told me
about a guy named Warren...

02:51.875 --> 02:56.083
who hangs out in the alley
behind Liquor Time
and buys kids beer.

02:56.125 --> 02:58.625
Excellent!
We'll go after school.

02:58.667 --> 03:01.041
So you're still doing
that whole Hebrew thing, huh?

03:01.083 --> 03:03.792
Yes, Steve! It's who I am!

03:03.834 --> 03:05.709
It's everything to me!

03:08.166 --> 03:13.041
This is interesting, Francine.
Congress is in session now.
In.

03:13.083 --> 03:15.208
So if we're at a party, say,

03:15.250 --> 03:18.500
and someone asks
whether it's in or not,
you'll know that it is in.

03:18.542 --> 03:21.083
Mmm.

03:21.125 --> 03:23.667
Oh, and look at this. It says
energy drinks for women...

03:23.709 --> 03:25.792
are the hottest thing
in a cool pink can.

03:25.834 --> 03:27.792
What am I doing?
I'm reading an ad.

03:27.834 --> 03:29.667
Knock, knock.
Sorry to interrupt.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.709
Hi, Libby.
I just got a call.

03:31.750 --> 03:34.709
My father's coming into town
and will be staying with us
for a few days.

03:34.750 --> 03:37.834
Oh, that sounds nice.
Yeah, yeah,
should be great fun.

03:37.875 --> 03:39.792
Oh, also,
he doesn't know I'm gay.

03:39.834 --> 03:43.083
So if I could keep
a few things over here while
he's in town, that'd be great.

03:43.125 --> 03:47.333
Our Mapplethorpe prints,
our baby, this nude drawing
I did of Burt Reynolds.

03:47.375 --> 03:49.000
It's unfinished.
Don't finish it.

03:49.041 --> 03:50.917
Terry, this is insane.

03:50.959 --> 03:53.917
Okay, the kitchen door entrance
is supposed to be just family.

03:53.959 --> 03:55.709
We've been together
for nine years.

03:55.750 --> 03:57.917
We have a baby. You have
to tell your father!

03:57.959 --> 03:59.834
You don't understand, okay?

03:59.875 --> 04:02.125
You don't know
what it's like
being the son of Tank Bates.

04:02.166 --> 04:04.792
Wait. Tank Bates
is your father?

04:04.834 --> 04:07.917
The All-Pro fullback
for the Washington Redskins,
Tank Bates?

04:07.959 --> 04:11.417
Yes. That's why
he's coming into town.
They're retiring his jersey.

04:11.458 --> 04:13.750
Theismann pitches out to Bates.
Bates comes around the end.

04:13.792 --> 04:16.542
The offensive line clears
a hole. He leaps over the top,
and he's short!

04:16.583 --> 04:18.458
He's stopped
at the one-yard line!

04:20.291 --> 04:22.959
Oh, it's okay.
They scored on the next play.
Quarterback sneak.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.709
Football! Catch the fever!

04:25.750 --> 04:28.041
Terry, Greg is right.

04:28.083 --> 04:32.834
You don't want Libby to grow up
thinking being gay is something
to be ashamed of, do you?

04:32.875 --> 04:36.458
As her godmother, I'll be there
to support you all the way.

04:37.625 --> 04:39.458
You know what?
You're right.

04:39.500 --> 04:42.750
It's time I tell
my father the truth.
Mmm.

04:42.792 --> 04:45.709
You mind if I come over
and toss the old pigskin
around with your dad...

04:45.750 --> 04:47.667
before you tell him
you're a banana-crammer?

04:47.709 --> 04:49.250
He probably
won't feel like it after.

04:53.834 --> 04:55.709
I don't see him.
Just some kids.

04:55.750 --> 04:58.875
We all see the kids,
Steve! God!

04:58.917 --> 05:01.500
There he is.

05:04.709 --> 05:07.000
♪ A little bit of Monica
in my life ♪

05:07.041 --> 05:09.208
E-Excuse me, are you Warren?

05:09.250 --> 05:11.208
Help you boys get loaded?

05:11.250 --> 05:14.166
You're the guy
who buys booze for kids?

05:14.208 --> 05:16.041
Sure. It's a great way
to make money.

05:16.083 --> 05:19.166
That's how I bought
my boom box, that's how
I bought my dog, Pepper,

05:19.208 --> 05:21.917
and that's how I bought
this folding chair
that turns into a backpack.

05:21.959 --> 05:23.834
I put it on
and I'm completely mobile.

05:23.875 --> 05:25.834
Great!
We'd like liquor, please.

05:25.875 --> 05:27.667
All right.
Be right back.

05:27.709 --> 05:29.709
If some little girl with
a bruise on her cheek...

05:29.750 --> 05:32.041
comes by and says
this is her dog, it is.

05:32.083 --> 05:33.625
Pepper is stolen.

05:35.917 --> 05:38.041
Terry, don't worry.
It'll be fine.

05:39.542 --> 05:42.542
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Oh, God! Oh, God!

05:42.583 --> 05:44.875
Sweetie, you can do this.

05:49.458 --> 05:51.667
Hey there, kid.
Hi, Dad.

05:51.709 --> 05:53.750
- He's so big!
- Sorry I'm late. Traffic was--

05:53.792 --> 05:55.583
Dad, I have
something to tell you,

05:55.625 --> 05:58.291
and if I don't do it right now,
I might never be able to.

05:58.333 --> 06:01.792
- All right. What is it?
- Y-You see, I--

06:01.834 --> 06:03.542
I'm--

06:07.458 --> 06:10.083
This is my girlfriend,
Francine, and we had
this baby out of wedlock,

06:10.125 --> 06:12.750
and I didn't tell you
because I knew
you wouldn't approve.

06:12.792 --> 06:14.750
And who are they?
Oh, that's Stan and Greg--

06:14.792 --> 06:16.625
the homos from
across the street.

06:22.125 --> 06:23.917
Morning, Greg.
How'd you sleep?

06:23.959 --> 06:27.583
Terrible. Is that
the first couch ever made?
Uh--

06:27.625 --> 06:31.792
I can't believe Terry.
That is my house
and my partner and my baby!

06:31.834 --> 06:33.834
And here I am living
out of an overnight bag...

06:33.875 --> 06:35.917
in the teardown
across the street!

06:38.375 --> 06:40.834
Good morning, Mr. Bates.
Morning.

06:40.875 --> 06:42.917
You know, I was just wondering
what the hell this is.

06:42.959 --> 06:45.208
Oh, it's Terry's. He--

06:45.250 --> 06:49.000
Our sex last night
was so satisfying.

06:49.041 --> 06:51.208
When I entered you--
that was divine.

06:51.250 --> 06:53.709
Terry, I've slept on it,

06:53.750 --> 06:56.667
and I've decided
I can accept this.

06:56.709 --> 06:59.375
Even though you had this baby
out of wedlock,

06:59.417 --> 07:01.875
I know you'll do the right thing
and get married.

07:01.917 --> 07:04.542
Yes, of course we will.

07:04.583 --> 07:06.333
Finally make
an honest woman out of me--

07:06.375 --> 07:08.000
Her! Out of her.

07:10.417 --> 07:13.458
Francine,
you need to come home.
Greg won't stop being snarky.

07:13.500 --> 07:16.542
Please be patient, Stan.
Terry said
he'll tell his father.

07:16.583 --> 07:19.041
He's just waiting
for the right moment.

07:22.208 --> 07:26.417
Oh, look at him.
He's just gonna float away,
float away like a fairy.

07:28.417 --> 07:31.959
Look at him,
carrying those heavy trash cans
like a girl.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.041
He probably wishes that rock
was a big, naked man.

07:39.166 --> 07:41.750
Yeah. Whistle a show tune,
you drag queen!

07:46.250 --> 07:48.500
What a day.
Where's dinner?
At the store.

07:48.542 --> 07:51.000
I don't cook, Stan.
We'll just have to
go out to dinner.

07:51.041 --> 07:55.041
But it's a weekday.
That's "once in a while
on weekends" talk.

07:55.083 --> 07:56.875
Straight women
don't ask for much, do they?

07:56.917 --> 07:58.875
They really don't.
Just use coasters
now and again...

07:58.917 --> 08:00.917
and don't whiz
in the shower
on her birthday.

08:00.959 --> 08:03.291
Have you seen Steve?
I want to see his face...

08:03.333 --> 08:06.458
when I tell him the midget
who acted inside of R2-D2 died.

08:06.500 --> 08:08.834
Love it.
Love everything about it.
But he's out at a party.

08:08.875 --> 08:11.125
I bought him so much beer!

08:11.166 --> 08:14.208
Roger, you can't
buy beer for Steve.
He's only 14.

08:14.250 --> 08:18.417
Maybe I didn't
make myself clear.
I did it for $12 profit.

08:22.166 --> 08:24.709
Director Bullock!
Smith.

08:24.750 --> 08:26.417
Hi. Greg Corbin,
Stan's neighbor.

08:26.458 --> 08:28.750
From Action News.
Of course!

08:28.792 --> 08:31.083
You and your partner,
Terry, are great.

08:31.125 --> 08:34.709
I had several gay experiences
when I was in boarding school.

08:34.750 --> 08:39.125
Nothing too big,
just some boyish
night poundings.

08:39.166 --> 08:42.166
What a coincidence.
That's my favorite vintage.

08:42.208 --> 08:44.375
Would you like to join us
for a glass,
Director Bullock?

08:44.417 --> 08:46.583
I suppose I could stay
for one glass.

08:50.834 --> 08:52.792
And Heisenberg's wife
was unhappy...

08:52.834 --> 08:55.375
because when her husband
had the time,
he didn't have the energy,

08:55.417 --> 08:57.542
and when he had the position,
he didn't have the momentum.

09:00.250 --> 09:02.834
See, because of his wife--
I don't even know!

09:02.875 --> 09:04.917
You know, Stan,
this is very last-minute,

09:04.959 --> 09:08.208
but I'm having a small
cocktail party tomorrow night.

09:08.250 --> 09:10.291
Would you and Greg
care to come?

09:11.834 --> 09:16.792
♪ Say it loud
and there's music playing ♪

09:16.834 --> 09:19.041
♪ Say it soft ♪

09:19.083 --> 09:23.417
♪ And it's almost
like praying ♪

09:23.458 --> 09:25.959
♪ Maria ♪

09:26.000 --> 09:29.500
♪ I'll never stop saying ♪

09:29.542 --> 09:35.375
♪ Maria ♪

09:38.500 --> 09:40.959
Excellent way
to express joy.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.375
See you both
tomorrow night, then.

09:43.417 --> 09:47.834
I finally got invited
to a Bullock party!
I'm in the big leagues now!

09:47.875 --> 09:50.709
My Helen Mirren,
my little queen.

09:50.750 --> 09:52.542
Hi, Francine.

09:52.583 --> 09:55.000
I'm just calling to tell you
this'll all be over soon.

09:55.041 --> 09:57.333
I locked Terry and Tank
in the den.

09:57.375 --> 10:00.333
They're not going anywhere
until Terry tells him the truth.

10:00.375 --> 10:02.125
I gotta go.
Here's my credit card.

10:02.166 --> 10:04.125
Put $30 on it.
That's what I feel like I owe.

10:07.625 --> 10:11.000
Terry, I hope you're talking
to your father in there.

10:11.041 --> 10:12.834
Talking to me about what?

10:12.875 --> 10:15.667
Uh, well, I-I need
to tell you something.

10:15.709 --> 10:17.417
Stan, what are you doing?

10:17.458 --> 10:19.166
What's going on?
What's been said?

10:19.208 --> 10:22.208
Not much. Terry's crazy broad
locked us in here.

10:22.250 --> 10:24.875
It was pretty quiet
until I flipped to Skinemax.

10:24.917 --> 10:29.709
Yep. Just father and son
sitting around and watching
a guy plow a girl.

10:29.750 --> 10:32.417
You only like this
50%, huh, fairy?

10:32.458 --> 10:34.834
I like this 100%.

10:36.917 --> 10:38.792
See what he's like?

10:38.834 --> 10:41.625
Francine,
I appreciate you trying,
but I am never telling him.

10:41.667 --> 10:43.375
I don't know
what I was thinking.

10:43.417 --> 10:45.750
Thank God Stan burst in
when he did.

10:45.792 --> 10:47.583
Why did you do that?
Do what?

10:47.625 --> 10:50.000
Test the ax that could
save our lives in a fire?

10:50.041 --> 10:52.750
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe because I care
a whole hell of a lot!

10:52.792 --> 10:55.000
I mean, I try so hard
and you try so little.

10:55.041 --> 10:57.750
And I-- I just--
I-I don't know.

10:57.792 --> 11:00.583
You're prettier
than all your sisters.

11:00.625 --> 11:03.417
- Roger, Steve could be dead!
- He could be--

11:03.458 --> 11:05.625
What up, you--

11:05.667 --> 11:08.750
you stupid-ass--

11:08.792 --> 11:12.834
Well, hello, potty mouth.
So I guess the party
was pretty good, then?

11:12.875 --> 11:16.875
'S awesome! I made out with
a girl I met at this place
that I went to after...

11:16.917 --> 11:19.166
to get some late-night
'za and 'da.

11:19.208 --> 11:20.917
'Za and, uh--

11:20.959 --> 11:23.458
Pizza and soda.

11:23.500 --> 11:26.458
When you're drunk,
you don't have time
for the beginning of words.

11:26.500 --> 11:28.792
All you care about
is 'ood and 'oonani.

11:28.834 --> 11:31.458
You're fun hammered.

11:31.500 --> 11:34.333
I swear that's the first time
you've genuinely made me laugh.

11:34.375 --> 11:36.917
You guys wanna meet her?
Come on in, baby!

11:44.792 --> 11:48.333
She's so heinous!
What have I done?

11:48.375 --> 11:52.333
Oh, Hayley, you were right!
Minors should never
drink alcohol. I see that now!

11:52.375 --> 11:55.583
Eat my mouth.

11:59.166 --> 12:02.542
I will make up
for what I have done
if it takes the rest of my life!

12:02.583 --> 12:04.583
Ooh, ooh.
Still wet. Still wet.

12:04.625 --> 12:07.166
You don't have toenails.

12:07.208 --> 12:09.500
Hello, I'm Roger.
I like to pretend!

12:09.542 --> 12:11.375
Come on!

12:16.208 --> 12:18.667
Your book was so inspiring,
Mr. Mandela.

12:18.709 --> 12:20.333
It made me want
to become a journalist.

12:20.375 --> 12:23.125
I am so happy
it spoke to you.

12:23.166 --> 12:25.792
I don't know what book
he's talking about,
but I love your movies.

12:25.834 --> 12:29.792
Especially The Bucket List.
Whoo! It got me. It got me.

12:29.834 --> 12:31.875
Uh, Stan,
I think you're mistaken.

12:31.917 --> 12:35.041
Aren't you Morgan Freeman?
This is Nelson Mandela!

12:35.083 --> 12:37.667
Why did you think
I was calling him
Mr. Mandela?

12:37.709 --> 12:41.917
I thought it was one of
Freeman's many nicknames,
like Captain Morgan or Freckles.

12:41.959 --> 12:43.875
Hey, Freckles,
you wanna hear a joke?

12:43.917 --> 12:47.417
Do they have jokes
in your country, or is it
just sadness all the time?

12:47.458 --> 12:49.583
Are you sad right now?

12:51.417 --> 12:54.667
He-- He pushed me in the pool!

12:54.709 --> 12:58.375
Oh, my God!
I'm his Francine!

12:58.417 --> 13:00.125
Drink to dull your shame?

13:00.166 --> 13:02.375
Oh, piggy wants two drinks.

13:02.417 --> 13:04.834
Drink it, piggy.
Does it taste good, pig?

13:07.625 --> 13:09.458
Yes, I am.

13:09.500 --> 13:12.083
Hey! Yoo-hoo!
Hey, plus one!

13:12.125 --> 13:15.208
You remember--
remember me, the person
that you came here with?

13:15.250 --> 13:18.625
Who's the old guy?
Stan Smith,
this is Elie Wiesel,

13:18.667 --> 13:21.166
Nobel-winning author of Night
and founder of--

13:21.208 --> 13:23.041
You're a son of a b-bitch,
you know that?

13:23.083 --> 13:26.291
Stan, please!
No! No!

13:26.333 --> 13:29.208
You're embarrassed of me.
Admit it!

13:29.250 --> 13:31.709
Don't touch me!
Don't ever touch me!

13:31.750 --> 13:34.333
Stan, you're making a scene.
That is not a scene!

13:34.375 --> 13:36.083
You-You want--
You want a scene?

13:36.125 --> 13:37.917
Here's your scene!

13:37.959 --> 13:39.667
Hope you can swim,
weasel!

13:41.166 --> 13:44.125
It's Wiesel. And yes, I can.

13:46.417 --> 13:51.375
Well, you don't have to worry
about me embarrassing you
ever again!

13:53.667 --> 13:56.208
Where's my wife?

13:56.250 --> 14:00.291
Francine, I need you
to come home right now.
Greg was mean to me!

14:00.333 --> 14:03.375
What are you talking about,
fruit loop?
She's Terry's girlfriend.

14:03.417 --> 14:06.000
No, she's not. She's my wife!

14:06.041 --> 14:09.875
- Greg is Terry's boyfriend.
- What?

14:09.917 --> 14:13.834
Terry and Greg are in love.
Your son is gay!

14:13.875 --> 14:15.834
Oh!

14:15.875 --> 14:18.375
See? That's not how
a straight guy faints.

14:18.417 --> 14:20.125
This is how
a straight guy faints.

14:25.500 --> 14:28.166
What? Where am I?
What happened?

14:28.208 --> 14:30.417
You outed Terry to his father,

14:30.458 --> 14:35.750
then passed out, woke up, puked
and stumbled into the bushes!

14:35.792 --> 14:38.709
My dad's upstairs packing.
He didn't say a word.

14:38.750 --> 14:42.709
He just looked at me
like he was envisioning all
the guys I ever had sex with,

14:42.750 --> 14:45.709
every late-night massage,
every back-alley zipper fight,

14:45.750 --> 14:48.750
ever Frasier cast party,
every Honda test drive
with Darryl.

14:48.792 --> 14:51.041
Terry!
Everybody calm down.
I'll talk to Tank.

14:51.083 --> 14:53.625
I know what he's feeling.
I used to think like him--

14:53.667 --> 14:56.166
scared of
the intimate man dance.

14:56.208 --> 14:58.375
And there's always
an underlying reason
for this kind of thing.

14:58.417 --> 15:00.291
You just have to figure out
what it is.

15:00.333 --> 15:03.458
I'm sorry I told you
your son was gay.

15:03.500 --> 15:06.333
But deep down,
you must have known,
so this is a good thing.

15:06.375 --> 15:08.959
No. I had no idea.
This is terrible.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.750
But... while you think
it's terrible,

15:11.792 --> 15:14.375
you're still glad
your son's happy.
No.

15:14.417 --> 15:18.125
Although, while you don't care
about your son's feelings,

15:18.166 --> 15:20.875
you realize that your prejudice
is based in ignorance.

15:20.959 --> 15:23.208
No. I understand it.
I just don't like it.

15:23.250 --> 15:27.166
However, while you may
understand it and not like it,

15:27.208 --> 15:30.834
you're sad that your son
was unhappy and kept this secret
from you for so long.

15:30.875 --> 15:34.083
No. I'm happy I didn't know.
I wish I'd never known.

15:34.125 --> 15:37.000
Be that as it may,
you think it's a choice...

15:37.041 --> 15:39.583
and you didn't realize
that people are born that way.

15:39.625 --> 15:43.291
No, I know it's not a choice,
and it still sickens me.

15:44.875 --> 15:47.583
Francine, you wanna
jump in here?
Anytime, sweetheart.

15:47.625 --> 15:51.625
Dad, please.
No. I'm going to a hotel until
my jersey retirement ceremony.

15:51.667 --> 15:53.500
You are no longer welcome.

15:56.375 --> 15:58.500
He's fine.

15:58.542 --> 16:00.917
He's probably just wondering
how two guys can do it.

16:00.959 --> 16:03.041
He'll calm down when I explain
it's like cramming together...

16:03.083 --> 16:05.000
two puzzle pieces
that don't quite fit.

16:05.041 --> 16:06.750
Shut up, Stan!
You've done enough!

16:08.500 --> 16:10.458
They're fine.

16:10.500 --> 16:12.291
Oh! I can't believe you!

16:13.959 --> 16:16.333
She's fine.

16:16.375 --> 16:19.792
I just need to figure out
the reason for Tank's hatred.

16:19.834 --> 16:23.083
I got it! I know why
Tank is reacting this way!

16:23.125 --> 16:25.083
I'm sorry. Are you--
Are you talking to me?

16:25.125 --> 16:28.041
What? Oh, no. I was just having
an out loud realization.

16:28.083 --> 16:31.208
Ah.
Would you like me to fill you in
on what it was?

16:31.250 --> 16:34.125
No, thanks. I have
a lot of stuff going on
in my own life right now.

16:36.417 --> 16:40.041
What's he got going on
that's so important?

16:42.291 --> 16:47.125
And my Megan, she would have
been 19 years old today.

16:47.166 --> 16:50.750
Thank you, Mrs. Holiday.

16:50.792 --> 16:54.333
Your last name
is very misleading
given your tragic circumstances.

16:54.375 --> 16:58.208
And now our last speaker
from MADD, Warren Beanstalk.

17:00.166 --> 17:03.959
Wow. I recognize a lot of faces
here today.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.041
I've bought alcohol
for many of you. But no more!

17:07.083 --> 17:09.500
I've changed my ways.

17:09.542 --> 17:13.041
I now understand
what a terrible epidemic
underage drinking is.

17:14.834 --> 17:17.917
Sixty-seven percent
of young people...

17:17.959 --> 17:21.291
who drink before the age of 15
will try an illicit drug.

17:21.333 --> 17:25.583
Last year, 21% of underage
drivers killed in accidents
were intoxicated.

17:26.917 --> 17:28.834
And 96% of you...

17:28.875 --> 17:31.542
will wind up making out
with a girl of this caliber.

17:46.709 --> 17:48.667
Roger, I can't believe
you did this to me!

17:48.709 --> 17:50.417
Oh, you'll feel better
after a few beers.

17:50.458 --> 17:53.250
Come on.
Let's go get drunk.
You're driving.

17:53.291 --> 17:56.417
Today we retire the jersey
of a heck of a guy...

17:56.458 --> 17:58.750
and a hell of
a football player.

17:58.792 --> 18:01.959
It's an honor to be here
with Tank Bates,

18:02.000 --> 18:04.417
All-Pro fullback
for the Washington Redskins.

18:09.583 --> 18:13.166
In his rookie season,
Tank rushed
for over a thousand--

18:13.208 --> 18:15.542
Tank Bates is a homosexual.

18:15.583 --> 18:18.458
Tank Bates is a homosexual.

18:18.500 --> 18:21.625
Tank Bates
is a homosexual.

18:21.667 --> 18:24.333
This is your plan to reunite me
and my father?

18:24.375 --> 18:26.000
Yeah.
It totally makes sense.

18:26.041 --> 18:28.041
But my dad's not gay!

18:28.083 --> 18:32.333
Yes, he is. That's why
he can't accept you,
because he can't accept himself,

18:32.375 --> 18:33.917
like Kevin Spacey...

18:35.083 --> 18:36.834
in K-PAX.

18:41.083 --> 18:44.834
I'm not gay!
You see how scared he is
of being judged?

18:44.875 --> 18:47.875
- Come on, people.
- Show your support!

18:47.917 --> 18:50.000
I am not gay!

18:50.041 --> 18:53.041
It's true.
He's a notorious womanizer.

18:53.083 --> 18:56.250
He slept with
all the cheerleaders,
the coach's daughter...

18:56.291 --> 19:01.125
and-- you're gonna love this--
my wife, last week.

19:01.166 --> 19:04.291
Shattered our family,
and here I am shaking his hand.

19:04.333 --> 19:07.709
I'm an embarrassment,
but I need to work.

19:07.750 --> 19:11.000
I mean, what am I
supposed to do?

19:11.041 --> 19:15.375
Okay, fine.
But if 50,000 people were
willing to accept you...

19:15.417 --> 19:17.458
when they thought
you were gay,

19:17.500 --> 19:19.709
don't you think you should give
your own son a chance?

19:22.583 --> 19:25.750
No! You think I care
what these drunken slobs think?

19:25.792 --> 19:27.709
They'll cheer for anything!
Watch!

19:27.750 --> 19:29.709
I just had a beer fart!

19:35.041 --> 19:38.875
Dad, I'm sorry to do this here,
but I'm gay. That's who I am.

19:38.917 --> 19:41.792
And this is who I'm with.
Greg is my partner.

19:41.834 --> 19:45.083
We have a child together.
We're a family.

19:45.125 --> 19:49.083
I want you to be part of it,
but only if you can
accept me for who I am.

19:50.667 --> 19:53.834
I can't. It's wrong,
and I want nothing
to do with it.

19:56.500 --> 20:00.333
Brenda, don't.
You're breaking my heart.

20:00.375 --> 20:03.417
How could you do this?
How could you bring us here?

20:03.458 --> 20:07.667
How could you be so stupid?
How could you--
Now hold on a minute.

20:07.709 --> 20:12.333
Sure, Stan took something
extremely private and made it
into a public spectacle,

20:12.375 --> 20:14.750
but he was just trying to help.

20:14.792 --> 20:18.333
He may act like an idiot,
but it comes from a good place.

20:18.375 --> 20:20.583
That should count for something.

20:20.625 --> 20:23.875
It counts! It counts for a lot!

20:23.917 --> 20:26.959
See that? She loves him
for who he is,

20:27.000 --> 20:29.250
in spite of his many,
many, many faults.

20:29.291 --> 20:33.083
If your dad can't accept you
for who you are, then you
don't need him in your life.

20:33.125 --> 20:36.458
Yeah! Cut him out of your life!

20:36.500 --> 20:39.750
No. I don't need him
in our life.

20:39.792 --> 20:43.375
Yeah! All's well.

20:43.417 --> 20:48.083
You-- You stood up for me,
even though I acted like
a complete fool.

20:48.125 --> 20:52.333
Of course. You're my husband.
My idiot husband.

20:59.959 --> 21:03.583
Rudy! Rudy! Rudy!

21:03.625 --> 21:07.333
Rudy! Rudy! Rudy!

21:07.375 --> 21:11.041
He did it! He got in the game
for one play and made a tackle!

21:19.792 --> 21:23.834
Okay. What's the difference
between a priest and a watch?

21:27.208 --> 21:28.959
That wasn't the punch line.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.750
Joke's over, fellow.
The lady laughed. Move on.

21:44.208 --> 21:45.959
Bye! Have a beautiful time.
