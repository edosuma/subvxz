WEBVTT

00:00.923 --> 00:02.924
Carroll was convicted in 2004

00:03.045 --> 00:05.293
for the murders
of 14 young women.

00:05.395 --> 00:07.927
The warden granted Joe
Carroll's request for a transfer.

00:08.034 --> 00:08.738
He's leaving.

00:08.834 --> 00:10.185
Joe's not in the
transport vehicle.

00:10.299 --> 00:11.312
Where the hell is he?

00:13.134 --> 00:15.211
So Joe's free,
and now I get locked up.

00:15.323 --> 00:17.172
Protective custody.
Better if I don't know.

00:17.356 --> 00:18.623
Quantico sent in a new guy.

00:18.721 --> 00:20.629
Nick Donovan,
top of the food chain.

00:20.722 --> 00:23.032
This investigation starts
at my desk now.

00:23.139 --> 00:23.991
Joe Carroll!

00:24.454 --> 00:25.729
How the hell are you?

00:26.113 --> 00:27.140
I'm Roderick.

00:27.271 --> 00:29.593
Emma, why did you leave us?

00:29.708 --> 00:30.858
Emma!

00:30.951 --> 00:32.455
Any word from Jacob and Paul?

00:32.555 --> 00:33.313
They haven't called.

00:33.438 --> 00:34.701
- Hang on. I'm gonna get us some help.
- Thank you.

00:35.398 --> 00:36.918
I love my wife.

00:37.022 --> 00:38.399
She's not here.

00:38.820 --> 00:41.026
Losing Claire was a mistake,

00:41.137 --> 00:42.692
but I have an idea
how we can find her.

00:42.817 --> 00:44.956
Agent Weston, tell
us where Claire is.

00:45.045 --> 00:45.930
I don't know anything.

00:46.027 --> 00:46.955
Claire's location.

00:47.052 --> 00:48.914
He's the only one who does
know where Claire is.

00:49.078 --> 00:50.124
Everyone's waiting.

00:50.234 --> 00:51.646
- What for?
- For you.

00:53.437 --> 00:56.413
Good morning, everybody.

00:57.067 --> 00:59.185
How did Carroll
escape in a helicopter

00:59.298 --> 01:00.264
in broad daylight?

01:00.375 --> 01:01.941
Carroll's people infiltrated
the prison system,

01:02.042 --> 01:03.137
the warden was compromised.

01:03.246 --> 01:06.067
Agent Parker how many people are
a part of Joe Carroll's cult?

01:06.239 --> 01:08.061
Early evidence suggested
somewhere under 12,

01:08.188 --> 01:11.219
but in light of Carroll's
recent escape,

01:11.338 --> 01:13.368
tactical resources, manpower,

01:13.517 --> 01:14.904
it could be upwards
of a hundred.

01:15.016 --> 01:16.232
How did you arrive
at that number?

01:16.344 --> 01:18.406
Carroll's visitors log
in prison contained

01:18.523 --> 01:20.188
47 false identities,

01:20.292 --> 01:22.863
and his internet usage,
although heavily encrypted,

01:22.972 --> 01:24.281
suggested twice that many.

01:24.398 --> 01:26.080
That's a guess at best, Agent.

01:26.183 --> 01:27.566
Are we looking
for a cult compound

01:27.704 --> 01:28.919
like Waco or Jonestown?

01:29.039 --> 01:30.373
Yes. We believe
there to be

01:30.494 --> 01:32.433
some sort of safe haven.

01:32.553 --> 01:34.086
But you don't know
where that is.

01:35.358 --> 01:37.721
No. We don't.

01:39.547 --> 01:41.388
Our working theory is that it's

01:41.511 --> 01:44.203
within a 3-state radius
of Virginia.

01:44.311 --> 01:45.239
Let me get this straight.

01:45.356 --> 01:46.586
There's an organized gathering

01:46.715 --> 01:48.346
of dozens of killers out there,

01:48.600 --> 01:50.486
and you have no idea
where they are.

01:50.591 --> 01:51.783
Can I just remind everyone

01:51.930 --> 01:54.901
that this is a briefing
and not an inquisition?

01:55.019 --> 01:56.145
Who are these people
he recruits?

01:56.248 --> 01:57.566
They can't all be
serial killers.

01:57.677 --> 01:59.537
He has recruited from
all walks of life--

01:59.660 --> 02:03.849
housewives, teachers, accountants,
military, law enforcement.

02:03.969 --> 02:05.295
All of whom fit
the personality types

02:05.408 --> 02:07.151
associated with
cult susceptibility--

02:07.267 --> 02:09.954
empty, lost, maladjusted.

02:10.061 --> 02:11.050
They're full-blow
psychopaths.

02:11.152 --> 02:13.190
The acolytes that we've
encountered have run the gamut

02:13.343 --> 02:15.113
from visionary to hedonistic,

02:15.242 --> 02:17.398
one-time killers,
mission-oriented killers,

02:17.528 --> 02:19.023
fans of killers, groupies.

02:19.136 --> 02:22.372
Mr. Hardy, an agent was captured
and assaulted by cult members.

02:22.487 --> 02:24.187
Was he able to identify
his captors?

02:24.293 --> 02:25.693
That agent--
Mike Weston--

02:25.839 --> 02:27.450
we have a sketch artist
standing by

02:27.573 --> 02:29.138
for the moment he
regains consciousness.

02:29.256 --> 02:30.491
And his cult--
have you identified

02:30.617 --> 02:32.322
their religion or manifesto?

02:32.433 --> 02:35.287
Both a novelist
and a professor,

02:35.430 --> 02:37.650
Carroll's using
literary themes found

02:37.781 --> 02:39.615
in the works
of Gothic Romanticism.

02:39.727 --> 02:42.457
"All that we see or seem

02:43.169 --> 02:46.820
is but a dream
within a dream."

02:47.387 --> 02:50.642
That is what
this moment is for me.

02:50.750 --> 02:52.709
He's speaking to his subjects

02:52.829 --> 02:56.142
with the promise of
elevating their lives--

02:56.783 --> 02:59.164
through death, one
experiences life.

02:59.278 --> 03:05.104
I will never forget
what you have all done for me,

03:05.343 --> 03:07.894
the sacrifices you have made,

03:08.599 --> 03:11.982
but now the time
has come for you...

03:12.102 --> 03:14.775
By his own admission,
Carroll has engaged his followers

03:14.911 --> 03:16.510
to write their own chapters,

03:16.624 --> 03:20.037
become part of this
novel that he's writing.

03:20.166 --> 03:25.033
I want to hear from each
and every one of you.

03:25.154 --> 03:26.742
Tell me...

03:26.886 --> 03:29.849
what inspires you.

03:29.978 --> 03:31.559
I need your help

03:32.418 --> 03:36.688
to finish our story.

03:36.801 --> 03:38.032
He's united with his people.

03:38.135 --> 03:40.794
He will do something
to ignite them to action.

03:40.952 --> 03:42.235
I see it in your eyes.

03:42.351 --> 03:44.705
I know you are ready.

03:46.779 --> 03:49.394
It's time for him to tell
the next part of his story.

03:51.770 --> 03:53.585
And so we begin.

www.addic7ed.com

04:01.785 --> 04:03.322
That didn't go well.

04:03.466 --> 04:05.187
Eh, too many people have died.

04:05.635 --> 04:07.073
It's a PR nightmare.

04:07.703 --> 04:08.769
Got to blame someone.

04:08.885 --> 04:10.109
Agent Parker!

04:10.272 --> 04:11.479
I just heard from Franklin.

04:13.181 --> 04:14.464
Will you excuse us?

04:16.841 --> 04:18.244
I'll wait in the car.

04:21.194 --> 04:22.580
Am I out?

04:22.752 --> 04:24.449
I know they're discussing it.
Just tell me.

04:24.563 --> 04:27.559
No, but they are taking the
operation control to DC.

04:27.903 --> 04:29.299
Where does that leave me?

04:30.405 --> 04:33.629
Everyone recognizes that Ryan
Hardy's integral to all this,

04:33.765 --> 04:35.303
but he's a wild card.

04:35.430 --> 04:37.829
They want you to stay
on, hold his hand.

04:38.436 --> 04:39.714
You'll keep your taskforce here

04:39.862 --> 04:41.911
and continue to report to me.

04:44.658 --> 04:46.268
Understood.

05:48.232 --> 05:49.768
Mom.

05:51.856 --> 05:55.833
For, uh, my chapter,
I thought that I...

05:57.489 --> 06:00.660
I'm sorry. I've been
working on this forever.

06:01.174 --> 06:03.524
I'm just so nervous
with you here.

06:03.686 --> 06:05.824
Um, where was I?

06:06.109 --> 06:07.820
Yes. My chapter.

06:08.197 --> 06:10.738
It's okay.
Hey. Relax.

06:11.569 --> 06:14.256
Come on. Shake it out.
Shake it out.

06:14.380 --> 06:15.517
Oh. Okay.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.285
Thank you for seeing me.

06:22.635 --> 06:25.352
I've been wanting
to visit for so long now.

06:25.456 --> 06:27.643
I know I must seem like
some groupie to you.

06:27.788 --> 06:29.201
No. No, Amanda. No.

06:29.352 --> 06:34.083
I found your letters
really quite moving.

06:34.199 --> 06:35.890
I'm glad to finally meet you,

06:36.011 --> 06:39.194
and you wrote in your last one

06:39.569 --> 06:41.643
that something
had happened. What?

06:41.754 --> 06:45.714
Yes, but I-- I couldn't
write it in a letter.

06:46.635 --> 06:50.052
Let me guess.
Your husband.

06:50.182 --> 06:51.655
You know, he was cheating on me

06:51.766 --> 06:53.366
with that boney-ass thing
he works with--

06:53.470 --> 06:55.481
Lindsay, the one
with the huge fake things--

06:55.585 --> 06:58.213
right under my nose in my bed.

06:58.350 --> 07:00.243
I could smell it on my sheets.

07:00.358 --> 07:02.233
I knew you had your suspicions.

07:02.383 --> 07:04.760
You wrote in a letter,

07:05.893 --> 07:09.249
"insist on happiness."

07:11.263 --> 07:16.427
So I took a shotgun
to both of them.

07:16.530 --> 07:17.868
My daddy was big on gaming.

07:17.978 --> 07:19.651
He could hunt anything.

07:19.943 --> 07:22.460
I know my way around animals,

07:22.581 --> 07:25.011
so I went to a hardware store

07:25.128 --> 07:27.229
and bought a hatchet,
electric hacksaw,

07:27.346 --> 07:29.023
some ammonia, and a bucket.

07:29.139 --> 07:30.917
It took a few days
to bag them up.

07:31.072 --> 07:32.953
Then I drove to Florida
and dumped in a swamp

07:33.064 --> 07:34.820
and drove straight here.

07:35.132 --> 07:37.257
They're gonna find some pieces.

07:37.366 --> 07:40.165
They can DNA
and CSI that stuff.

07:40.284 --> 07:42.027
They'll come for me.

07:42.332 --> 07:45.071
Do you have to go
back to Oklahoma?

07:45.174 --> 07:49.518
I don't have
anywhere to go, Joe.

07:52.381 --> 07:54.248
I have a friend.

07:54.510 --> 07:56.397
His name is Roderick.

07:57.024 --> 08:01.003
He's been known to help
other friends of mine.

08:01.957 --> 08:05.562
I'm sure he'd be able to
give you a place to stay.

08:09.778 --> 08:12.416
You love your wife.

08:13.039 --> 08:15.140
I know you want her back,

08:15.317 --> 08:18.636
and I want that for you, Joe.

08:20.234 --> 08:26.554
I want my chapter to
have a happy ending.

08:29.327 --> 08:31.172
Go on.

08:39.129 --> 08:40.465
Jacob.

08:40.576 --> 08:42.119
What?

08:44.486 --> 08:46.722
He's my friend, mom,
and he's hurt.

08:46.856 --> 08:48.260
I recognize him.

08:48.415 --> 08:50.554
Your faces are plastered
all over the news.

08:50.667 --> 08:54.158
You're a wanted fugitive--
kidnapping, murder?

08:54.280 --> 08:55.695
I never killed anybody, mom.

08:55.814 --> 08:57.639
- The FBI said you did.
- Well, I haven't.

08:57.771 --> 08:59.811
They say that you're involved
with that serial killer,

08:59.931 --> 09:01.330
you're part of a cult?

09:01.532 --> 09:03.358
I didn't say that
I was innocent.

09:04.625 --> 09:05.808
Why are you here?

09:05.963 --> 09:07.945
Because it's
impossible at home.

09:08.052 --> 09:11.423
There are federal agents
patrolling our house.

09:11.513 --> 09:13.680
Reporters are following
your father to work.

09:15.341 --> 09:17.466
Well, that's a bummer.

09:17.746 --> 09:19.149
Poor guy.

09:21.292 --> 09:23.696
Help me understand this, Jacob.

09:25.431 --> 09:27.009
I'm you're mother,
and I love you,

09:27.149 --> 09:29.260
but I don't understand this.

09:34.618 --> 09:37.089
I don't think that
I can explain.

09:52.504 --> 09:53.978
No, Detective.

09:54.124 --> 09:55.121
I'm staring at it right now.

09:55.244 --> 09:57.819
That's not Paul Torres,
that's not Jacob Wells.

09:57.934 --> 10:00.078
Nope. Absolutely sure.

10:00.528 --> 10:01.883
Neither man.

10:02.335 --> 10:04.404
Nope. Not a waste
of my time. Thanks.

10:04.515 --> 10:05.641
Complete waste of my time.

10:05.743 --> 10:08.271
This is the Chief Homicide
Detective in Dallas.

10:08.388 --> 10:09.812
I'm sorry.
I let it through.

10:09.929 --> 10:11.157
He was convinced.

10:11.589 --> 10:12.950
Ryan Hardy.

10:13.204 --> 10:14.490
Hello, Ryan.

10:16.125 --> 10:17.477
What can I do for you, Joe?

10:17.574 --> 10:20.618
I just wanted to see how your
friend Agent Weston was doing.

10:20.733 --> 10:23.826
I heard that he took
quite a beating.

10:24.156 --> 10:26.464
He's expected to make
a full recovery.

10:26.597 --> 10:29.712
Oh. Oh. That's good--
good to hear.

10:30.106 --> 10:32.010
Sorry about
your friends, though.

10:32.330 --> 10:34.095
They're kind of dead.

10:34.213 --> 10:36.963
That's okay.
I have more. Heh.

10:39.560 --> 10:41.935
So what do you want, Joe?

10:42.880 --> 10:44.660
You know, just a chat.

10:44.813 --> 10:47.431
I'm feeling
a-a bit down.

10:48.039 --> 10:52.314
Tell me, do you miss
Claire, Ryan?

10:52.452 --> 10:53.915
I know I do.

10:54.060 --> 10:56.328
Ironically, you're
the only person

10:56.437 --> 10:59.284
who really understands
how I feel at the moment,

10:59.394 --> 11:02.591
being we both love
the same woman.

11:02.884 --> 11:07.299
Why is love so punishing, Ryan?

11:07.412 --> 11:08.198
Come on.
Get something.

11:08.298 --> 11:09.087
He's on a satellite phone.

11:09.189 --> 11:10.140
It's sending me to Singapore.

11:10.238 --> 11:11.691
Link to Homeland,
see if they can intercept.

11:11.830 --> 11:13.445
Love's elation always seems to

11:13.560 --> 11:15.222
turn to pain.

11:15.553 --> 11:19.241
How true the adage
"love hurts," huh?

11:19.920 --> 11:27.055
Tell me, how much-- how much
hurt can one man endure, Ryan?

11:28.268 --> 11:32.589
At, uh, what point
does he break?

11:33.438 --> 11:35.317
You must let me know.

11:46.421 --> 11:48.463
I can't remember.
What is good here?

11:48.581 --> 11:50.945
Did I get the hamburger
steak last time?

11:51.064 --> 11:52.931
You liked it, didn't love it.

11:53.156 --> 11:55.038
That's fine.
Will you order?

11:55.150 --> 11:56.807
Uh, no onions,
gravy on the fries.

11:56.918 --> 11:58.198
I'm gonna wash my hands.

12:14.084 --> 12:16.594
I'm sorry.
Can I help you?

12:16.908 --> 12:18.211
Yes, you can.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.676
I need you to give
someone a message.

12:20.788 --> 12:22.376
I'm sorry.
Do I know you?

12:23.018 --> 12:25.271
What are you doing?
What's in your hands?

12:25.414 --> 12:26.736
Oh, it's nothing really.

12:26.921 --> 12:28.548
I need you to do
something for me.

12:28.669 --> 12:29.935
It's like a favor.

12:30.090 --> 12:33.537
There's this man
named Ryan Hardy.

12:33.643 --> 12:35.389
I think you have
the wrong table.

12:35.793 --> 12:37.611
This is important.

12:38.012 --> 12:41.331
You need to tell Ryan
Hardy that some--

12:41.635 --> 12:45.054
sometimes love hurts.

12:45.160 --> 12:46.275
Can you remember that?

12:46.440 --> 12:48.190
Hey.
Hi.

12:48.329 --> 12:50.064
- Who is this?
- I don't know.

12:50.175 --> 12:51.551
She has something in her hands.

12:51.672 --> 12:52.854
What do you have there?

12:52.969 --> 12:54.858
A customized 24-inch
pressurized spear gun

12:54.996 --> 12:56.854
mainly used for
deep sea fishing.

12:57.184 --> 12:58.599
What are you
gonna do with that?

13:00.622 --> 13:03.732
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to laugh.

13:03.987 --> 13:05.122
I'm gonna try it out.

13:06.536 --> 13:08.198
- Unh!
- Oh, my God!

13:08.329 --> 13:10.868
Oh, my God! Help!
She's bleeding!

13:10.976 --> 13:12.613
Don't forget what I told you.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.857
Oh, my God! Help me!
Somebody help me!

13:14.984 --> 13:16.001
Thank you.

13:16.521 --> 13:18.449
Oh, my God! Help me!

13:18.747 --> 13:19.818
She's bleeding!

13:20.075 --> 13:22.719
Help me!
Somebody, help me!

13:40.925 --> 13:45.467
And then she just
walked right out the door.

13:45.670 --> 13:50.593
She said, "tell Ryan
Hardy that love hurts."

13:50.707 --> 13:52.386
I don't understand.

13:52.598 --> 13:54.667
Why would she kill Claire?

13:57.023 --> 13:58.053
Excuse me, ma'am.

13:58.173 --> 14:01.397
Hi. Uh, your friend
Claire Dobkins,

14:01.509 --> 14:02.961
was she married?

14:03.745 --> 14:05.750
She was separated.

14:06.062 --> 14:07.383
Why?

14:07.607 --> 14:09.291
What was her maiden name?

14:11.073 --> 14:12.922
It was Matthews.

14:16.984 --> 14:19.634
Hey. You need to make sure
Claire is safe.

14:19.737 --> 14:21.155
She is safe. We moved
her to a new location

14:21.249 --> 14:23.001
- after Weston's attack.
- Well, check again. Confirm it.

14:23.149 --> 14:24.033
She's safe, Ryan.

14:24.143 --> 14:25.497
She can't turn on the TV, okay?

14:25.605 --> 14:26.866
If she sees this,
it's going to kill her.

14:26.995 --> 14:29.145
- You're overreacting.
- You need to take away all media access.

14:29.226 --> 14:30.863
- Let them do their job.
- Just do it!

14:33.050 --> 14:34.420
Hey. You okay?

14:34.540 --> 14:36.700
No. I'm fine.
I'm good, I'm good.

14:36.825 --> 14:38.034
It's just...

14:38.564 --> 14:42.732
Joe said, "how much hurt
can one man endure?

14:42.858 --> 14:43.703
He's trying to break you.

14:43.816 --> 14:46.939
By targeting women
with his wife's name.

14:47.054 --> 14:49.490
I mean, how many Claire
Matthews are out there?

14:57.217 --> 14:58.583
Your wound is infected.

14:58.688 --> 14:59.985
Can you help me?

15:00.413 --> 15:01.579
You're a nurse, right?

15:01.761 --> 15:03.995
Jacob said you were a nurse.

15:04.098 --> 15:07.577
I was.
I'm not anymore.

15:09.402 --> 15:12.666
Who are you calling?
Who are you calling?

15:12.765 --> 15:14.829
I'm leaving another
message for Emma.

15:15.155 --> 15:17.512
She's not gonna call you back.

15:18.405 --> 15:20.918
Don't you get it?
She left us.

15:21.767 --> 15:23.972
She left us to die.

15:24.088 --> 15:25.815
At the farmhouse?

15:25.919 --> 15:28.459
I-- I never trusted her.

15:29.243 --> 15:31.616
She never trusted me either.

15:33.695 --> 15:35.199
Her name is Robyn Stewart.

15:35.311 --> 15:37.108
She works at the Moser plant
near the boatyard.

15:37.211 --> 15:39.060
I've been watching her
for a few months now.

15:40.082 --> 15:42.314
I think she's perfect for you.

15:44.416 --> 15:46.492
What? You mean, you want
me to do this by myself?

15:46.613 --> 15:47.709
Yeah. Why not?

15:47.812 --> 15:49.270
- You don't trust me.
- It's not that.

15:49.387 --> 15:50.663
Emma, I've killed before.

15:50.774 --> 15:52.303
But not with us.

15:53.347 --> 15:55.148
Look. If it will
make you feel better,

15:55.564 --> 15:57.094
Jacob will go with you.

16:08.574 --> 16:10.890
Look. I want to
be here, all right?

16:10.997 --> 16:12.127
I moved here, didn't I?

16:12.227 --> 16:15.229
I gave up everything in El
Paso just to be near Joe.

16:22.930 --> 16:26.765
Look. You can
trust me, I promise.

16:27.338 --> 16:28.846
And you can trust us.

16:28.984 --> 16:30.209
I can't trust you.

16:30.316 --> 16:31.700
I can't trust you.

16:31.810 --> 16:32.830
I can't trust you.

16:32.927 --> 16:34.036
Hey. Hey!

16:34.167 --> 16:36.213
Easy, easy, easy.

16:36.322 --> 16:37.447
Shh.

16:39.324 --> 16:40.678
I'm sorry.

16:41.293 --> 16:43.219
I'm sorry.

16:49.113 --> 16:50.502
We're reporting
live from a diner

16:50.617 --> 16:51.831
in the Union Hill District,

16:51.967 --> 16:54.751
where earlier today
a woman was brutally murdered.

16:54.875 --> 16:57.399
This is another in a series
of slayings attributed

16:57.516 --> 17:00.068
to serial killer Joe Carroll
and his cult of killers...

17:00.160 --> 17:01.268
Is everything okay?

17:01.427 --> 17:03.221
Mmm. Very much so.

17:03.330 --> 17:05.698
I was quite worried about
our nervous little Amanda,

17:05.800 --> 17:09.339
but she appears to be rather
proficient with her weapons.

17:09.453 --> 17:10.980
Sources tell us
that Ms. Matthews

17:11.102 --> 17:13.089
was placed
in protective custody

17:13.286 --> 17:16.223
since her ex-husband's
recent prison escape.

17:22.773 --> 17:24.332
Are we okay?

17:24.598 --> 17:29.890
I'm not sure we should
advertise our indiscretion.

17:32.409 --> 17:34.380
Is it really so bad?

17:36.265 --> 17:39.684
I thought it was
worth it, personally.

17:41.907 --> 17:46.167
Roderick, um, is there any
news on Jacob or Paul?

17:46.286 --> 17:48.910
No, no. Not yet.
I'll keep looking.

17:49.005 --> 17:51.057
Yes. Yes. Thank you.

17:51.744 --> 17:56.156
I'm sure Emma
would be most grateful.

18:10.138 --> 18:12.113
I'm sorry about that, mom.

18:12.225 --> 18:15.201
He's got sepsis.
You realize that?

18:17.581 --> 18:21.134
If you don't get him to a hospital
immediately, he's going to die.

18:22.334 --> 18:24.060
Can you help him?

18:24.912 --> 18:26.640
He needs a blood transfusion,

18:26.756 --> 18:29.950
antibiotics, surgery
when he's stable.

18:30.716 --> 18:33.152
You need to get him
to a hospital.

18:40.608 --> 18:42.397
You should go now.

18:43.357 --> 18:45.836
Before your father gets here.

18:46.610 --> 18:48.408
He's on his way.

18:50.785 --> 18:52.298
Louise Sinclair we know,

18:52.413 --> 18:53.658
and this is Amanda Porter.

18:53.757 --> 18:55.255
She's wanted for murder
in Oklahoma City.

18:55.376 --> 18:56.359
It's believe she killed
her husband

18:56.455 --> 18:57.565
and the woman
he was sleeping with.

18:57.670 --> 18:58.714
Their dismembered remains
were discovered

18:58.819 --> 19:00.210
in a Florida swamp in '07.

19:00.313 --> 19:02.971
Okay. So we got 87
Claire Matthews in the US,

19:03.094 --> 19:04.499
14 in the state.

19:04.607 --> 19:06.218
5, including Joe Carroll's ex,

19:06.321 --> 19:07.463
reside in the Richmond area.

19:07.560 --> 19:09.215
We're in the process
of locating them now.

19:09.312 --> 19:10.919
Claire Matthews
on Monroe Drive, she's safe.

19:11.061 --> 19:11.958
Local PD have her.

19:12.102 --> 19:13.812
Good. That's one.
3 more to find.

19:13.933 --> 19:15.518
Come on. Let's go,
let's go.

19:26.950 --> 19:28.257
Hello?

19:29.030 --> 19:30.362
What?

19:33.338 --> 19:36.371
Authorities are asking
anyone named Claire Matthews

19:36.494 --> 19:39.450
to please contact
their local law enforcement.

19:40.722 --> 19:42.673
Someone's at the door.

19:46.102 --> 19:46.915
Who is it?

19:47.038 --> 19:47.846
It's the police,

19:47.937 --> 19:49.513
we are looking
for Claire Matthews.

19:49.621 --> 19:51.126
Hang on.
It's the police.

20:14.053 --> 20:17.315
Joe Carroll is targeting
women with the same name as his wife.

20:17.440 --> 20:19.034
We have law enforcement
across the country

20:19.166 --> 20:21.038
responding to this threat,
but we need your help locally

20:21.154 --> 20:23.010
to get the word out
and be on alert.

20:23.145 --> 20:25.804
This is our suspect
Amanda Porter,

20:25.929 --> 20:30.010
35 years of age, wanted in
suspicion of at least two murders.

20:30.136 --> 20:32.287
If anyone sees her,
do not engage.

20:32.385 --> 20:35.038
Contact your local authorities
or the FBI immediately.

20:35.279 --> 20:36.429
Okay.

20:36.974 --> 20:39.117
Hey. We found
another Claire.

20:39.227 --> 20:40.046
She's in protection.

20:40.141 --> 20:41.600
That means just one
still out there.

20:42.121 --> 20:44.911
There's something
too pedestrian about this.

20:45.017 --> 20:47.486
Why would Joe call me up
and foreshadow

20:47.623 --> 20:48.445
what he was up to?

20:48.558 --> 20:49.495
He can't have Claire.

20:49.585 --> 20:50.753
He wants to punish you for it.

20:50.856 --> 20:52.139
What if this isn't
about me at all.

20:52.312 --> 20:54.319
Maybe he's trying
to lure her out

20:54.422 --> 20:56.836
because I'm telling you if
she knows this is happening

20:56.957 --> 20:58.164
she will offer herself up.

20:58.271 --> 20:59.222
But she doesn't.

20:59.324 --> 21:01.302
She's not seeing it.
I believe Nick.

21:01.514 --> 21:03.295
She has no media access.

21:04.682 --> 21:06.131
I hope you're right.

21:10.879 --> 21:13.175
Amanda Porter kills
her husband and his mistress

21:13.294 --> 21:14.899
in a single act of rage.

21:15.018 --> 21:17.438
How does she escalate to mission
killer on a murder spree?

21:17.551 --> 21:18.811
You got add the cult component.

21:18.917 --> 21:21.149
This his her chapter of
Joe Carroll's playbook.

21:21.258 --> 21:22.180
I mean, look at these murders.

21:22.287 --> 21:23.521
They're public statements.

21:23.730 --> 21:26.060
This guy is big on theatrics.

21:26.182 --> 21:28.329
Look at the weapons.
They're like props--

21:28.451 --> 21:31.594
spear gun, garrote,
even he uses an ice pick.

21:31.706 --> 21:35.377
This is a cult member who's
using her leader's playbook

21:35.501 --> 21:39.351
complete with...
romantic underpinnings.

21:39.856 --> 21:41.097
"Love hurts."

21:42.182 --> 21:43.594
Drink some water.

21:46.890 --> 21:49.055
You've got to get him
to a hospital, Jacob.

21:49.171 --> 21:51.065
You're just worried dad's gonna
come home and see me, aren't you?

21:51.166 --> 21:52.881
He's going to call the police.

21:53.069 --> 21:55.080
Do you want that?
You're a murderer.

21:55.176 --> 21:56.958
Stop saying that, mom!

21:57.059 --> 21:58.898
I never killed anyone.

22:00.395 --> 22:01.601
Tell her.

22:02.439 --> 22:04.659
Come on. Tell her
the truth.

22:16.029 --> 22:18.710
A friend of dad's--
this was back in El Paso--

22:18.822 --> 22:20.000
he was a badass
ex-Marine.

22:20.106 --> 22:21.594
He used to make fun
of me all the time,

22:21.703 --> 22:24.043
really lay in on me,
rough me up.

22:24.163 --> 22:25.675
One night, I just had enough.

22:25.974 --> 22:29.697
I cracked his head, and I
pushed him down the stairs.

22:29.854 --> 22:30.931
Heh heh.

22:31.366 --> 22:32.802
I was 12.

22:41.663 --> 22:43.463
So is this an audition?

22:43.572 --> 22:46.372
Yeah. I mean, I got
to be careful.

22:46.479 --> 22:47.739
Well, so do I.

22:47.854 --> 22:49.204
You stab her first.

22:49.905 --> 22:52.122
No, man. It's all you.
That was the deal.

22:52.225 --> 22:54.157
How do I know I can
trust the two of you?

22:54.252 --> 22:55.656
Hey. How do I know
you're not setting me up?

22:55.748 --> 22:56.438
Why would we do that?

22:56.521 --> 22:57.873
Look. I don't know.

22:58.828 --> 23:01.077
I'll finish her off. You just
have to take the first stab.

23:01.176 --> 23:02.976
That way, I know we
can trust each other.

23:04.567 --> 23:06.045
All right?

23:20.119 --> 23:21.934
You've never killed anyone.

23:22.045 --> 23:24.138
- Yes, I have.
- Then do it.

23:25.945 --> 23:28.485
Ha ha ha!

23:36.771 --> 23:38.141
Does your little
girlfriend know?

23:38.250 --> 23:39.223
Honesty and trust

23:39.326 --> 23:40.232
are the foundation

23:40.322 --> 23:41.160
of all relationships.

23:41.245 --> 23:42.357
Screw you, man.

23:42.481 --> 23:43.794
Take it easy.

23:43.907 --> 23:45.885
All right? Relax.
Don't hyperventilate.

23:45.984 --> 23:48.157
Take a breath.
Ha ha ha!

23:58.165 --> 24:00.359
Jacob's telling the truth.

24:04.451 --> 24:06.947
He's never killed anyone.

24:29.461 --> 24:30.956
Ha ha ha!

24:42.441 --> 24:43.849
You bumming?

24:43.972 --> 24:45.639
You look like you're bumming.

24:46.554 --> 24:48.104
I'm not.

24:49.917 --> 24:51.325
Want to get drunk?

24:52.685 --> 24:55.112
How are you
the sheriff of a town?

24:56.020 --> 24:57.508
Well...

24:58.819 --> 25:00.753
first you go to
the police academy,

25:00.854 --> 25:01.692
get your diploma.

25:01.811 --> 25:02.639
They give you a gun.

25:02.730 --> 25:04.469
Get a badge, walk patrol.

25:17.274 --> 25:20.954
My family is big
on public service.

25:21.090 --> 25:22.792
I mean, they practically
preached it.

25:22.937 --> 25:26.682
My dad was military, mom
loves her politics,

25:27.119 --> 25:28.381
blah blah.

25:30.413 --> 25:32.288
But you found Joe.

25:32.580 --> 25:33.960
Yeah.

25:34.821 --> 25:38.778
Joe, uh, speaks to
my contradictions.

25:41.447 --> 25:44.052
We all have our
gray areas, Emma.

25:45.036 --> 25:46.508
For instance,
Joe loves his wife,

25:46.647 --> 25:48.968
and, I mean, he loves his wife,

25:49.086 --> 25:52.142
and yet he slept with you.

25:54.975 --> 25:57.633
You need to mind
your own business.

25:58.224 --> 26:01.139
And you have
a boyfriend somewhere.

26:02.740 --> 26:04.651
And your boyfriend's
got a boyfriend,

26:05.038 --> 26:06.073
and...

26:06.471 --> 26:10.023
I'd call that a gray
area, wouldn't you?

26:10.183 --> 26:11.393
You don't know
anything about it.

26:11.493 --> 26:13.191
Are you even worried
about them?

26:14.055 --> 26:16.476
Do you even care if we find Jacob?
Yes, I care!

26:19.137 --> 26:20.769
I love Jacob.

26:21.892 --> 26:23.421
I want him here with me.

26:23.528 --> 26:24.553
Really?

26:24.657 --> 26:26.669
I checked your satellite phone.

26:27.287 --> 26:29.327
It's just full of messages

26:29.456 --> 26:31.769
from your little
lost boyfriend.

26:33.980 --> 26:35.725
"Emma!

26:37.118 --> 26:39.933
Why'd you leave, huh?

26:40.322 --> 26:42.168
Why'd you leave us?

26:42.290 --> 26:44.123
I love you, Emma!

26:45.179 --> 26:48.552
Please, call me."

27:00.513 --> 27:05.073
So Carroll made two
attempts to get his wife.

27:05.195 --> 27:06.447
Both failed.

27:06.557 --> 27:08.515
So now he's making
public statements?

27:08.655 --> 27:11.436
Why? To get at you?

27:13.200 --> 27:14.948
That's what he wants
me to think.

27:15.065 --> 27:17.671
I think he's speaking
directly to Claire.

27:17.797 --> 27:21.047
I think he's trying to reach her, to
lure her out of protective custody.

27:21.163 --> 27:22.608
That hasn't happened.

27:22.725 --> 27:25.501
I have confirmation she
is not aware of this.

27:27.896 --> 27:30.523
Just spoke with the roommate of
our missing Claire Matthews.

27:30.660 --> 27:32.512
She's a student
at Thurman Community.

27:32.623 --> 27:34.958
The roommate says she's at some
school festival just off campus.

27:35.066 --> 27:35.974
She left her cell phone
at home,

27:36.077 --> 27:37.666
- so they can't reach her.
- Let's go.

27:37.773 --> 27:39.272
Call ahead and
notify local police.

27:39.425 --> 27:41.860
Get every available
agent there now.

27:46.941 --> 27:48.642
The e-mail worked.

27:48.958 --> 27:50.292
Roderick just sent us
an address.

27:50.386 --> 27:52.186
They're gonna meet us and
take us to the others.

27:56.587 --> 27:58.489
Your father's gonna
be here in 5 minutes.

27:58.595 --> 28:00.401
You have to leave now.

28:03.272 --> 28:04.910
Come on. I need to get you
out of here.

28:05.109 --> 28:06.305
Come on. Come on.

28:06.428 --> 28:08.130
No, no.

28:08.223 --> 28:09.081
Come on. We have to go.

28:09.198 --> 28:10.855
No, no.

28:12.122 --> 28:14.178
No, no.
You go.

28:14.265 --> 28:16.001
Dad's gonna call the police.
We need to go.

28:16.099 --> 28:16.878
You owe me.

28:16.962 --> 28:17.620
What are you talking about?

28:17.707 --> 28:19.256
I'm not just gonna
leave you here.

28:19.374 --> 28:20.264
Just go.

28:20.338 --> 28:21.302
I wouldn't do that
to you. Come on.

28:21.395 --> 28:22.553
You owe me.

28:23.109 --> 28:24.239
What are...

28:25.545 --> 28:27.171
You owe me.

28:29.922 --> 28:30.979
What the hell's
wrong with you, man?

28:31.088 --> 28:32.568
I can't believe
that just happened.

28:32.694 --> 28:34.714
I mean-- I mean,
the way you just--

28:34.899 --> 28:36.276
did you see her eyes?

28:36.533 --> 28:37.310
Did you see her eyes?

28:37.415 --> 28:38.766
Hey, hey.
Take it easy.

28:39.291 --> 28:40.176
Hey. Come here.

28:40.279 --> 28:42.632
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.

28:45.950 --> 28:47.223
It's okay.

28:54.285 --> 28:55.744
All right?

28:57.045 --> 28:59.772
Emma's-- Emma's
gonna hate me.

29:00.315 --> 29:01.266
She doesn't know about this.

29:01.377 --> 29:02.078
She'll hate me!

29:02.181 --> 29:03.563
We're not gonna tell her.

29:08.135 --> 29:10.441
Why would you do that for me?

29:12.890 --> 29:14.584
Because I like you.

29:14.707 --> 29:16.398
I mean, you're a good guy.

29:19.291 --> 29:21.650
Besides, now you owe me.

29:25.960 --> 29:27.859
- All right?
- All right.

29:31.515 --> 29:32.938
Please.

29:33.047 --> 29:35.210
I want my life
to mean something.

29:35.921 --> 29:39.539
That's-- that's really
all I ever wanted.

29:43.428 --> 29:47.570
It's perfect.
It's perfect.

29:49.966 --> 29:51.842
You can do this.

29:52.573 --> 29:53.929
You can do it.

30:01.513 --> 30:03.014
Jacob.

30:05.187 --> 30:06.971
Thank you.

30:10.397 --> 30:11.951
I love you.

31:20.264 --> 31:21.720
We're looking
for Claire Matthews,

31:21.835 --> 31:24.921
22, dark brown hair, 5'8",

31:25.028 --> 31:27.434
last seen wearing
a blue jacket and jeans.

31:27.538 --> 31:28.973
Canvass the entire block.

31:29.079 --> 31:31.276
Everyone stay
in constant radio contact.

31:31.372 --> 31:32.664
Let's move!

31:37.395 --> 31:38.797
Hey. I'm Steve.
What's your name?

31:39.147 --> 31:40.620
Claire.

31:40.766 --> 31:42.211
Let's see your face.

31:44.765 --> 31:46.004
Come on.

32:07.729 --> 32:11.057
Hey. I spotted Louise just
south of the dance floor.

32:11.166 --> 32:12.408
I'm in pursuit.

32:20.126 --> 32:21.210
Wait. Don't I know you?

32:21.325 --> 32:22.757
I don't think so.

32:22.946 --> 32:24.598
Is your last name Matthews?

32:24.742 --> 32:26.139
How did you know that?

32:26.235 --> 32:28.059
The police are looking for you.

32:28.428 --> 32:30.073
Hang on. Let me
pull it up.

32:32.174 --> 32:35.618
They say she's killing people
named Claire Matthews.

32:36.353 --> 32:38.567
You should find
a cop or something.

32:48.452 --> 32:50.071
That's her.

32:50.180 --> 32:51.707
Get out of here!

32:53.702 --> 32:54.562
Leave her alone.

32:54.761 --> 32:58.240
Aw. What do we have
here-- Mr. Helper?

33:04.961 --> 33:06.548
Ryan, do you still have Louise?

33:06.651 --> 33:07.862
I lost her.

33:08.975 --> 33:12.823
Hey. I got somebody
hurt here by the ferris wheel.

33:14.263 --> 33:15.920
I need some backup now!

33:27.471 --> 33:30.447
Help me! There's a woman
who wants to kill me!

33:36.643 --> 33:38.402
Help me! Help me!
Help me, please!

33:38.518 --> 33:40.576
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Miss Matthews?

33:40.698 --> 33:41.799
Yeah.

33:42.752 --> 33:44.806
It's okay. You're
gonna be fine.

33:44.921 --> 33:46.225
Just stay here.

33:47.321 --> 33:49.664
All available units,
I have Claire Matthews.

33:49.769 --> 33:51.872
I have Claire Matthews
at the festival exit.

34:00.007 --> 34:01.658
Help me!

34:02.684 --> 34:05.441
Stop right there!
Hands in the air!

34:06.466 --> 34:08.005
Drop the weapon!

34:10.395 --> 34:12.545
And if I refuse?

34:12.716 --> 34:14.201
I will shoot you dead.

34:14.525 --> 34:16.233
I don't think you
have the--

35:19.791 --> 35:21.245
Aah!

35:23.307 --> 35:24.806
Agh!

35:27.605 --> 35:29.388
She's after me!

35:29.502 --> 35:31.080
Help me, please!

35:37.303 --> 35:39.216
Claire. Claire.

35:39.322 --> 35:40.743
She's right here.

35:50.260 --> 35:51.789
Drop the gun, Ryan.

35:52.348 --> 35:53.852
Do it!

36:00.489 --> 36:03.204
- Don't hurt her.
- Kick it away, now!

36:05.639 --> 36:06.595
Let her go.

36:06.722 --> 36:08.038
No, Ryan.

36:08.136 --> 36:09.380
It doesn't work that way.

36:09.491 --> 36:12.960
She has to die because
you have to be punished.

36:13.069 --> 36:14.644
You slept with Joe's wife,

36:14.759 --> 36:17.400
and between you and me,
I don't take that lightly.

36:17.543 --> 36:19.244
Let her go!
That's not Joe's wife!

36:19.340 --> 36:21.232
It's a freaking metaphor, Ryan!

36:25.517 --> 36:26.976
Tell them to stay back.

36:27.081 --> 36:29.554
Back, back.
Stay back, stay back.

36:29.652 --> 36:30.877
Okay.

36:32.235 --> 36:33.593
Now you got to let her go.

36:33.903 --> 36:37.072
Hey. Kill me.

36:37.480 --> 36:40.018
No. I have to
kill her.

36:40.117 --> 36:41.402
Love hurts, Ryan.

36:41.497 --> 36:42.780
That's the theme here.

36:42.892 --> 36:44.298
Joe Carroll gets
a happy ending!

36:44.395 --> 36:47.314
You don't get one. Cheaters
don't get happy endings!

36:47.421 --> 36:48.692
My husband didn't get one!

36:48.796 --> 36:51.969
You're right.
It was a mistake.

36:52.084 --> 36:54.575
I-- I-- I shouldn't
have done it.

36:54.937 --> 36:56.235
Then why did you?

36:56.347 --> 36:57.493
Please, please just let her go.

36:57.590 --> 37:00.182
Why? Why did you
do it?

37:05.320 --> 37:07.398
Because I love her.

37:10.082 --> 37:12.017
Thank you.

37:12.646 --> 37:14.882
That was very honest.

37:14.971 --> 37:16.560
And now...

37:17.211 --> 37:19.181
you got to do something for me

37:20.011 --> 37:21.550
because you're right.

37:22.892 --> 37:24.361
I do...

37:24.708 --> 37:26.567
I need to be punished.

37:28.801 --> 37:30.457
Come on. Just kill me...

37:30.567 --> 37:31.413
Stay back.

37:31.534 --> 37:33.188
Because I still love her,

37:33.722 --> 37:36.113
and I can't unlove her.

37:37.521 --> 37:39.500
The only way that you and Joe

37:40.067 --> 37:42.176
are gonna get a happy ending

37:42.276 --> 37:44.180
is if you kill me.

37:45.587 --> 37:47.601
So come on. Just do it.

37:47.774 --> 37:52.012
Just... take that
nail gun,

37:52.685 --> 37:54.260
shoot me right in the head.

37:54.434 --> 37:57.097
You can do it. Come on.

37:57.234 --> 37:58.558
I know you can.

37:58.662 --> 37:59.949
Do it now.

38:00.789 --> 38:02.829
Now. Now!

38:02.925 --> 38:04.938
No! Ohh! Aah!

38:05.290 --> 38:07.355
No! No!

38:21.187 --> 38:23.214
Ryan Hardy's proven
to be more of a challenge

38:23.323 --> 38:24.768
than I thought.

38:24.889 --> 38:27.143
Eh. I wouldn't
underestimate that man.

38:27.246 --> 38:29.124
I made that mistake once.

38:30.829 --> 38:32.545
What happened?

38:33.550 --> 38:35.561
Louise is dead.

38:35.696 --> 38:36.548
Oh.

38:36.645 --> 38:38.567
Amanda's in federal custody.

38:38.924 --> 38:41.339
That is unfortunate.

38:41.443 --> 38:42.779
I'm sorry about Louise.

38:43.268 --> 38:45.768
I know she was
important to you.

38:48.450 --> 38:50.349
Not really.

38:51.477 --> 38:53.621
Maybe. I don't know.

38:54.742 --> 38:56.163
There is good news.

38:56.291 --> 38:58.303
At noon today,
FBI Agent Nick Donovan

38:58.411 --> 39:01.113
made an encrypted cell phone
call to Quantico, Virginia,

39:01.225 --> 39:03.558
checking the status
of Claire Matthews.

39:03.710 --> 39:05.482
We deciphered that encryption.

39:05.899 --> 39:07.578
And what did you find?

39:07.757 --> 39:08.946
Well, call was transferred

39:09.055 --> 39:10.208
to several Bureau offices

39:10.312 --> 39:12.808
before it was
finally transferred

39:12.910 --> 39:14.552
to US Marshal Scott Turner,

39:14.655 --> 39:17.200
currently in charge of
personal security for Claire.

39:17.313 --> 39:18.512
We were able to narrow
her location

39:18.619 --> 39:20.352
to the nearest
cell phone tower.

39:21.564 --> 39:25.589
Your wife is in Huntington
County, Pennsylvania.

39:27.495 --> 39:29.109
Oh. That...

39:29.229 --> 39:32.949
that is excellent
work, my friend.

39:35.186 --> 39:37.254
I want to interview Amanda
first thing in the morning.

39:37.357 --> 39:38.941
Agent Donovan said that
wasn't gonna happen.

39:39.037 --> 39:40.201
Yeah. Well, we could
break her.

39:40.310 --> 39:41.351
Thing about Joe's cult members,

39:41.460 --> 39:43.626
they don't come
to this party sane.

39:43.916 --> 39:45.399
We just got to speak
their own language.

39:45.498 --> 39:47.887
Look. I agree with you,
but Director Franklin

39:47.991 --> 39:50.027
ordered that she be
transferred to DC.

39:50.151 --> 39:52.024
They're questioning her
at headquarters.

39:52.867 --> 39:54.009
You're kidding me.

39:54.582 --> 39:56.597
They're moving the whole
investigation there.

39:56.692 --> 39:57.578
They're taking the lead.

39:57.674 --> 39:59.057
How do you feel about that?

40:00.525 --> 40:02.149
Like a failure.

40:06.947 --> 40:10.156
Hey. You're not.

40:14.223 --> 40:18.547
So... all that stuff Ryan was saying
tonight about Claire Matthews--

40:19.397 --> 40:21.165
he's still hung up on her?

40:21.490 --> 40:22.946
He loves her.

40:24.131 --> 40:26.043
That's just twisted.

Joe maybe?

What is it?

41:19.738 --> 41:20.942
Well Joe's a little
busy right now,

41:21.057 --> 41:23.079

41:23.495 --> 41:25.054

41:28.474 --> 41:31.247
Earlier I received
a very exciting e-mail,

41:31.854 --> 41:33.302

41:33.431 --> 41:37.016
but I thought I'd surprise you.
