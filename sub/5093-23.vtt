00:01.826 --> 00:05.689
<i>Previously, on </i> Blue Bloods...
What is happening

00:05.689 --> 00:08.125
<i>at the Bitterman Houses</i>
<i>has gone on long enough.</i>

00:08.127 --> 00:11.245
In the Bitter End,
Los Lordes makes the move.

00:11.247 --> 00:12.163
Hector.

00:12.165 --> 00:13.831
Is that you?
Skinny Vinny.

00:13.833 --> 00:14.865
Gang that runs this place--

00:14.867 --> 00:16.200
they got a mute button
they can push.

00:16.202 --> 00:17.534
That's Santana,
right there.

00:17.536 --> 00:18.719
He's the leader
of Los Lordes.

00:18.721 --> 00:21.088
<i>Oh, and she's his girl?</i>

00:21.090 --> 00:22.640
So it's war that you want.

00:22.642 --> 00:23.758
If I gotta step on your throat,

00:23.760 --> 00:25.760
<i>so be it.</i>
Stop! Police!

00:26.979 --> 00:28.596
- Vinny, it's a setup.
- Come on.

00:28.598 --> 00:29.564
You're gonna be okay.

00:29.566 --> 00:32.016
I told you this is the end.

00:36.772 --> 00:38.406
Reagan,
you heard me wrong.

00:38.408 --> 00:40.891
We still got nothing to pick
up Santana and his crew on,

00:40.893 --> 00:42.526
No warrant...
No, I heard you right.

00:42.528 --> 00:43.494
But they killed Vinny.

00:43.496 --> 00:45.162
...want cards,
nothing.

00:45.164 --> 00:46.563
Come on, they killed a cop.

00:46.565 --> 00:47.865
Or they know who did.

00:47.867 --> 00:49.584
But we still
don't have a play.

00:49.586 --> 00:51.285
I'm still not taking
"no" for an answer.

00:51.287 --> 00:53.904
Me either.
But... what are we gonna do?

00:53.906 --> 00:55.756
We're gonna do what my mother
told us to do

00:55.758 --> 00:57.041
as kids on a rainy day:

00:57.043 --> 00:58.793
we're gonna go make our own fun.

01:00.045 --> 01:02.630
<i>It's worse than a bad idea...</i>

01:02.632 --> 01:04.348
This isn't about your comfort level, Frank.
Comfort level?

01:04.349 --> 01:05.850
You want me to get up
in front of

01:05.852 --> 01:07.018
an auditorium full of people...

01:07.020 --> 01:07.802
Citizens of our city.

01:07.804 --> 01:08.919
Yes, some of whom

01:08.921 --> 01:10.304
almost certainly
have information

01:10.306 --> 01:12.556
about the murder of
one of my police officers

01:12.558 --> 01:13.641
and won't say a word.

01:13.643 --> 01:14.925
So speak your piece--

01:14.927 --> 01:16.143
to them, in their house.

01:16.145 --> 01:17.478
We got a big divide here.

01:17.480 --> 01:19.096
You want to win all
their hearts and minds,

01:19.098 --> 01:21.198
I want to grab some of 'em
by the short and curlies.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.317
Frank, the promise you made
to this city was to heal the rift...

01:23.319 --> 01:24.435
Yeah...
between the NYPD

01:24.437 --> 01:26.320
and the Bitterman community.
Which starts

01:26.322 --> 01:27.455
when one of them
gives up Officer Cruz.

01:27.457 --> 01:28.789
They have to make
the first move.

01:28.791 --> 01:30.825
Enough.
Exactly.

01:34.446 --> 01:36.464
Town Hall meeting, Frank--
7:00 p.m.,

01:36.466 --> 01:37.765
Bitterman Housing Project.

01:37.767 --> 01:40.468
I'll see you there; you and me.
Is that an order?

01:40.470 --> 01:42.303
It's an opportunity you don't
want to pass up, Commissioner.

01:42.305 --> 01:44.338
So it's an invitation.

01:46.091 --> 01:47.224
Yes.

01:47.226 --> 01:48.809
It's an invitation, Frank,
to that part of you

01:48.811 --> 01:50.594
that's smart enough to hold
more than one equation

01:50.596 --> 01:52.146
in your thick Irish head.

01:54.950 --> 01:56.934
<i>So what are you saying?</i>
<i>You're not gonna serve me now?</i>

01:56.936 --> 01:58.352
Get out.

01:58.354 --> 01:59.803
Well, I have rights,
you know.

01:59.805 --> 02:02.156
For your own damn good, get out.

02:02.158 --> 02:03.607
Why?

02:03.609 --> 02:05.026
Oh, 'cause Santana's
coming down.

02:05.028 --> 02:06.610
Huh?

02:06.612 --> 02:08.746
Well, you just texted him
when I walked in.

02:08.747 --> 02:10.364
Oh, don't play dumb;
I saw you.

02:10.366 --> 02:12.166
Reagan, you
did me a favor once--

02:12.168 --> 02:14.251
you took care
of me and my sister.

02:14.253 --> 02:15.586
I'm not gonna forget that.

02:15.588 --> 02:17.788
Well,
you just returned the favor

02:17.790 --> 02:19.990
by calling Santana down here.

02:19.992 --> 02:20.991
You're crazy.

02:20.993 --> 02:22.376
Yeah?

02:22.378 --> 02:24.045
Well, you want to hear
something really crazy?

02:24.047 --> 02:26.830
I can kind of predict
the future, Nona,

02:26.832 --> 02:29.717
and this, uh,
doesn't end good for you.

02:30.585 --> 02:32.203
Yeah.

02:32.205 --> 02:34.138
Detective.

02:36.558 --> 02:38.943
This is a place
of business.

02:38.945 --> 02:40.061
That right?

02:40.063 --> 02:43.314
And you're bad
for this business.

02:44.851 --> 02:46.617
Oh, what's this?

02:46.619 --> 02:49.070
An NYPD officer was
murdered in cold blood

02:49.072 --> 02:51.188
in the Bitterman Houses.

02:51.190 --> 02:54.158
I was wondering if you may know
something about the shooter.

02:54.160 --> 02:55.859
I don't know nothing.

02:55.861 --> 02:58.829
Detective Baez, are Mr. Santana
and his associates

02:58.831 --> 03:00.030
displaying a threatening

03:00.032 --> 03:01.499
or hostile attitude,
in your opinion?

03:01.501 --> 03:03.033
Definitely, Detective Reagan.

03:03.035 --> 03:05.202
Mm-hmm. And are you
at all concerned

03:05.204 --> 03:06.804
that Mr. Santana
and his associates

03:06.806 --> 03:08.672
may be carrying
concealed weapons?

03:08.674 --> 03:09.540
Very concerned.

03:09.542 --> 03:11.058
Me, too.

03:11.060 --> 03:13.210
Turn around and get your hands
against the bar-- move!

03:13.212 --> 03:15.262
You, too.

03:15.264 --> 03:16.547
Move!

03:16.549 --> 03:19.383
You know,
your own rules say, "Stop,

03:19.385 --> 03:20.935
question and frisk."

03:20.937 --> 03:22.820
Yeah. Um, how's this
for a question?

03:22.822 --> 03:24.655
What's your favorite movie?

03:25.273 --> 03:26.941
Oh...

03:28.827 --> 03:30.411
...what do we have here?

03:30.413 --> 03:32.830
You got a carry permit
for this, tough guy?

03:32.832 --> 03:34.415
I left it at home.

03:34.417 --> 03:36.784
Really? Too bad for you.

03:36.786 --> 03:38.902
What's with the phone?

03:38.904 --> 03:40.921
My name is Carlos
Villalobos.

03:40.923 --> 03:43.090
I'm Mr. Santana's attorney.
Yeah?

03:43.092 --> 03:45.543
I'm recording two
NYPD detectives

03:45.545 --> 03:47.211
harassing Mr. Santana
in his place

03:47.213 --> 03:48.429
of business.

03:48.431 --> 03:49.547
Put it away.

03:49.549 --> 03:50.931
No police had been summoned,

03:50.933 --> 03:52.416
and no crime was occurring.

03:52.418 --> 03:53.517
I said put it away!

03:53.519 --> 03:56.137
If you do not cease
and desist, I will...

03:56.139 --> 03:57.471
file a complaint.

03:57.473 --> 04:00.057
You stay put,
you come with me.

04:00.059 --> 04:01.592
Turn it off.

04:04.279 --> 04:06.063
Why don't we make
a deal, Detective?

04:06.065 --> 04:07.398
I don't make deals
with you.

04:07.400 --> 04:09.733
You stop jackin' me and
I'll fix the other thing.

04:09.735 --> 04:12.403
Doesn't work that way.
Well, it can if you're smart.

04:12.405 --> 04:15.489
I am smart, and it still
doesn't work that way.

04:15.491 --> 04:16.957
Why don't you ask your papi

04:16.959 --> 04:18.459
before you start
rejecting my, uh,

04:18.461 --> 04:20.577
generous offer?

04:20.579 --> 04:22.746
- What did you say?
- Reagan...

04:22.748 --> 04:25.166
we have a bird in the hand.
Let's take him in.

<i>Commissioner Reagan,</i>

04:46.656 --> 04:49.607
we had 19 murders

04:49.609 --> 04:51.775
in this project last year.

04:51.777 --> 04:54.945
And do you know how many arrests
were made by the NYPD?

04:54.947 --> 04:56.614
Six.

04:56.616 --> 04:58.332
Yeah, six.

04:58.334 --> 05:01.202
I'm not happy,
and you're not happy.

05:01.204 --> 05:04.505
But you can be sure
my homicide detectives

05:04.507 --> 05:06.340
work as thoroughly
and efficiently...

05:06.342 --> 05:08.375
...as they can

05:08.377 --> 05:10.294
under the circumstances.

05:10.296 --> 05:12.880
W-What circumstances?
What does that mean?

05:12.882 --> 05:15.132
It's like
the NYPD can't be bothered

05:15.134 --> 05:16.800
'cause of the address is

05:16.802 --> 05:18.219
more like it!

05:20.690 --> 05:22.806
No, sir.

05:22.808 --> 05:24.725
Could I ask your name?

05:24.727 --> 05:26.694
Raul Pereira.

05:26.696 --> 05:29.446
Mr. Pereira, first of all,

05:29.448 --> 05:34.017
thank you for having
the courage to speak up.

05:34.019 --> 05:37.288
And I would like to
ask you a question.

05:37.290 --> 05:39.740
You're not gonna like
the answer.

05:40.910 --> 05:42.643
I'll take that chance.

05:42.645 --> 05:45.412
Say your cat is stuck up
in a tree,

05:45.414 --> 05:48.716
and you call the fire department
to help you get him down.

05:48.718 --> 05:50.701
But when they get there,

05:50.703 --> 05:53.254
you won't tell 'em
what the cat looks like,

05:53.256 --> 05:55.172
or where the tree is.

05:55.174 --> 05:57.708
Sir, I ain't talking
about no damn cat!

06:03.148 --> 06:06.684
That is exactly the position
you put the NYPD in

06:06.686 --> 06:08.769
when you won't cooperate
with police...

06:14.994 --> 06:18.562
...and identify the who,
the where and the when.

06:22.033 --> 06:23.667
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
please listen.

06:23.669 --> 06:25.619
Just settle down,
and we can finish.

06:25.621 --> 06:27.121
Thank you, Commissioner.

06:27.123 --> 06:30.257
Listen, I, as a child of the
projects myself, completely...

06:30.259 --> 06:32.092
No, I...

06:32.094 --> 06:35.763
I completely understand
your frustration, I do.

The suspect has been identified

07:39.477 --> 07:41.544
as 16-year-old Hector Santiago,

07:41.546 --> 07:43.246
a resident
of the Bitterman Houses.

07:43.248 --> 07:44.280
I know him.

07:44.282 --> 07:45.531
What the hell you mean,
you know him?

07:45.533 --> 07:47.166
Vinny baby-sat him
back in the day.

07:47.168 --> 07:48.534
He called Vinny
"Skinny Vinny""

07:48.536 --> 07:50.036
The kid's, like,
not all there.

07:50.038 --> 07:51.120
I'd say so.

07:51.122 --> 07:52.705
No, I don't mean
'cause he did this.

07:52.707 --> 07:54.090
He, uh... he was born that way.

07:54.092 --> 07:55.791
Hold on. Is he Los Lordes?

07:55.793 --> 07:57.009
A banger? I doubt it.

07:57.011 --> 07:59.045
Or maybe he thought
he was earning his colors.

07:59.047 --> 08:00.329
Maybe, but I can tell you this.

08:00.331 --> 08:01.664
There's no way
the kid acted alone.

08:01.666 --> 08:03.216
Could be
he was promised something

08:03.218 --> 08:05.718
in exchange for taking a shot
at the PC, maybe?

08:05.720 --> 08:08.471
Who said anything about him
taking a shot at the PC?

08:08.473 --> 08:10.439
Nobody, but let's be honest
with ourselves.

08:10.441 --> 08:11.524
Who's the more likely target--

08:11.526 --> 08:13.226
the black mayor
from the projects himself,

08:13.228 --> 08:14.527
or the white top cop?

08:14.529 --> 08:16.863
Where are you going?
I'm going back to work.

08:16.865 --> 08:19.315
As far as I know, I'm the only
detective in the city

08:19.317 --> 08:21.367
with a Los Lordes soldier
in lockup.

08:21.369 --> 08:23.619
I'll pick my rosebuds
while I may.

08:23.621 --> 08:25.988
God help us.

08:25.990 --> 08:27.073
I don't think he can hear you.

08:27.075 --> 08:27.856
What do you mean?

08:27.858 --> 08:29.191
Who wants a drink?

08:29.193 --> 08:30.359
Drink to what?

08:30.361 --> 08:31.360
Jamie.

08:31.362 --> 08:32.828
Pray to what God? For what?

08:32.830 --> 08:34.380
For the fact that both you

08:34.381 --> 08:36.215
and your father are alive,
for starters.

08:36.217 --> 08:38.366
Just cut the crap.
Just stop

08:38.369 --> 08:40.535
kidding ourselves, admit
that it's a losing battle?

08:44.976 --> 08:46.842
How bad?

08:46.844 --> 08:49.178
He took two bullets--
one to the shoulder,

08:49.180 --> 08:50.763
but one's lodged
in the spine.

08:50.765 --> 08:53.516
He's paralyzed from
the waist down,

08:53.518 --> 08:55.685
but they're prepping
him for surgery now.

08:55.687 --> 08:58.053
Who?

08:58.055 --> 08:58.938
Dr. Heller.

08:58.940 --> 09:00.856
- Good.
- Frank!

09:00.858 --> 09:02.108
Jack.

09:02.110 --> 09:04.327
He wants to see you
before we go in.

09:04.329 --> 09:07.113
Come with me.

09:08.916 --> 09:11.534
Mayor Poole?

09:11.536 --> 09:14.236
What, are you bulletproof?

09:14.238 --> 09:15.904
No, just lucky.

09:16.907 --> 09:18.007
They catch that kid?

09:18.009 --> 09:18.958
Yes.

09:18.960 --> 09:20.977
I was just standing there...

09:20.979 --> 09:23.262
all of a sudden...

09:23.264 --> 09:26.315
Yeah.

09:26.317 --> 09:28.551
Who is he?

09:28.553 --> 09:32.138
Just a kid from the projects
is all we know right now.

09:33.890 --> 09:36.359
Show respect...

09:36.361 --> 09:38.945
earn cooperation, make repairs
with that community.

09:38.947 --> 09:40.763
I'll try.

09:40.765 --> 09:42.815
Don't try, just do it, Frank.

09:44.284 --> 09:48.270
I'm sorry
I have to put that on you.

09:48.272 --> 09:50.456
Wouldn't have it any other way.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.659
I mean it, Frank.

09:53.661 --> 09:55.494
I hear you, Carter.

09:55.496 --> 09:57.380
We gotta go.
This way.

10:02.135 --> 10:04.286
Good luck, boss.

10:05.555 --> 10:07.873
<i>All right, how about</i>
<i>we try this again?</i>

10:07.875 --> 10:09.625
Who gave this kid Hector
the gun?

10:09.627 --> 10:11.727
And who planted the gun
in the auditorium?

10:11.729 --> 10:13.846
It's not like
there's a lineup card, man.

10:13.848 --> 10:15.564
It's not like this,
it's not like that--

10:15.566 --> 10:18.184
why don't you tell me what
the hell it's like then, man?

10:18.186 --> 10:19.819
I really got to go
use the toilet.

10:19.821 --> 10:21.637
You'll use the toilet
when you give me something.

10:21.639 --> 10:22.772
For the five-hundredth
time, man!

10:22.774 --> 10:23.990
He has a right to
use the facility.

10:23.992 --> 10:26.359
He'll pee when I say he can!

10:27.644 --> 10:29.996
How about I paint
the picture for you, huh?

10:29.998 --> 10:32.915
Yesterday, I brought you in here
because I believe

10:32.917 --> 10:34.834
you know something
about a cop killing.

10:34.836 --> 10:37.286
Now, if I have you
locked up over that,

10:37.288 --> 10:39.755
I'm sure half the population's
probably gonna want

10:39.757 --> 10:41.090
to bake you a cake.

10:41.092 --> 10:42.792
I told you, I don't got nothing
to do with that!

10:42.794 --> 10:46.962
But today, if I can connect you
and your crew

10:46.964 --> 10:49.265
to the attempted assassination
of, what,

10:49.267 --> 10:52.685
the second black mayor
in the history of New York City,

10:52.687 --> 10:57.807
when word gets around the prison
amongst all the brothers,

10:57.809 --> 11:00.226
that your crew
shot that mayor,

11:00.228 --> 11:03.396
what position you think
that's gonna put you in?

11:03.398 --> 11:05.681
I really gotta go pee, man.

11:05.683 --> 11:07.867
I think it's gonna put you
in two positions:

11:07.869 --> 11:10.185
one position is curled up
on the ground

11:10.187 --> 11:13.239
like a pig with a shiv
stuck in your back...

11:15.192 --> 11:16.692
...and the other position

11:16.694 --> 11:19.045
is on your knees,
serving them

11:19.047 --> 11:21.163
like the bitch
that you are.

11:21.165 --> 11:23.833
Man, this is wack, man.

11:23.835 --> 11:26.034
He peed!

11:26.036 --> 11:28.054
I was telling you
the truth, man. I had to go!

11:28.056 --> 11:29.422
Well, why don't you
tell me the truth

11:29.424 --> 11:30.723
about something else then, huh?

11:30.725 --> 11:33.208
What, man? You turn against
your own crew?

11:33.210 --> 11:35.010
Huh?

11:36.646 --> 11:38.147
We all grew up there.

11:38.149 --> 11:40.599
We all got out moms,

11:40.601 --> 11:43.319
our aunts and cousins
and godparents.

11:43.321 --> 11:45.071
And you know what?

11:45.073 --> 11:47.189
It's not being free
walking around

11:47.191 --> 11:49.241
knowing what's gonna
happen to them.

11:49.243 --> 11:52.278
I don't care how far from
the Bitter End you can get me.

11:52.280 --> 11:54.497
I know that, back home,
they're taking out

11:54.499 --> 11:57.900
the pliers, the butane
and all of that,

11:57.902 --> 12:00.569
trying to find out
where I'm at.

12:00.571 --> 12:03.405
That's the damn truth,
Detective!

12:15.519 --> 12:18.804
I'd say good morning,
but what's the use?

12:18.806 --> 12:20.639
Yeah.

12:20.641 --> 12:22.308
You get anything out
of our friend?

12:22.310 --> 12:24.426
Fear and loathing.

12:24.428 --> 12:25.427
Anything else?

12:25.429 --> 12:27.696
He peed himself, literally.

12:27.698 --> 12:29.482
I'm telling you,

12:29.484 --> 12:31.700
Santana gets more shock and awe
out of these guys

12:31.702 --> 12:32.902
than we ever could, partner.

12:32.904 --> 12:34.570
There's no playing
the weakest link here.

12:34.572 --> 12:36.739
Yeah.

12:36.741 --> 12:39.492
Gonna have
to get Santana himself.

12:39.494 --> 12:40.910
It's all or nothing.

12:42.496 --> 12:44.130
Okay.

12:45.615 --> 12:47.833
<i>And that I will</i>
<i>faithfully discharge</i>

12:47.835 --> 12:50.753
the duties of the Office
of the Mayor, City of New York,

12:50.755 --> 12:53.806
to the best of my abilities,
so help me God.

12:53.808 --> 12:56.642
Thank you.

12:57.594 --> 12:58.878
Thank you.

12:58.880 --> 13:00.679
Bring my car around.

13:00.681 --> 13:02.515
Commissioner Reagan.

13:02.517 --> 13:04.517
A moment?

13:04.519 --> 13:06.135
Ms. Newhouse?
No.

13:06.137 --> 13:11.306
Um, this isn't how anybody wants
to take office, obviously.

13:11.308 --> 13:13.776
Well, until we have
a clearer idea

13:13.778 --> 13:15.694
of Carter's prognosis
going forward,

13:15.696 --> 13:18.531
the Public Advocate
serves as the Acting Mayor.

13:18.533 --> 13:19.999
And the Police Commissioner
serves

13:20.001 --> 13:21.500
at the pleasure of that Mayor.

13:21.502 --> 13:22.585
Yes.

13:22.587 --> 13:24.486
And you'll join me
at the press conference.

13:25.873 --> 13:27.206
Five minutes, tops.

13:27.208 --> 13:30.709
And when the first reporter
asks you, "What's it like

13:30.711 --> 13:32.011
"taking orders from a woman

13:32.013 --> 13:34.263
who's been mayor
for all of half an hour?"

13:34.265 --> 13:37.433
That I serve the people
of the City of New York

13:37.435 --> 13:40.669
and I do so at the pleasure
of the mayor,

13:40.671 --> 13:44.006
for as long as he
or she sees fit.

13:44.008 --> 13:46.325
And <i>she</i> has one request:

13:46.327 --> 13:49.011
to do whatever it takes.

13:49.013 --> 13:51.030
To...?

13:51.032 --> 13:54.450
To round 'em up
and bring 'em in--

13:54.452 --> 13:57.903
everybody with even a whiff
of a role in Cruz's murder

13:57.905 --> 13:59.038
and the mayor's shooting.

13:59.040 --> 14:01.323
We intend to.

14:01.325 --> 14:03.375
Every minute counts, Frank.

14:03.377 --> 14:05.861
I don't want a series
of status reports and updates

14:05.863 --> 14:07.029
which cost me cred

14:07.031 --> 14:08.747
and make my PC
look weak.

14:08.749 --> 14:10.499
We need shock and awe here.

14:10.501 --> 14:12.701
We need evidence
and corroboration.

14:12.703 --> 14:15.054
You have the full support
of this office behind you.

14:15.056 --> 14:18.090
I'm not asking for
nor do I want anything

14:18.092 --> 14:21.227
other than the license
to do my job as I always have.

14:21.229 --> 14:22.761
These are extraordinary
circumstances

14:22.763 --> 14:25.047
and they call for
extraordinary measures.

14:25.049 --> 14:29.935
To make the most of whatever
time you have in this office.

14:29.937 --> 14:34.556
The whole world is watching.
Whether or not you keep your job

14:34.558 --> 14:37.409
will be judged by how you handle
the next few days.

14:37.411 --> 14:40.996
I can be your top cop, Grace.

14:40.998 --> 14:44.416
Doesn't make me your guy.

14:44.418 --> 14:46.669
World of difference there.

14:55.659 --> 14:57.358
There is an enormous
police presence

14:57.359 --> 14:59.896
out here this morning,
a show of force on the heels

14:59.897 --> 15:01.774
of last night's
assassination attempt.

15:01.927 --> 15:04.377
But as one resident put it,
"It is too little, too late

15:04.379 --> 15:07.180
for the community here
at the Bitterman Houses."

15:07.182 --> 15:08.431
You got that right.

15:08.433 --> 15:10.483
Hey, Reagan, there's plenty
of blame to go around.

15:10.485 --> 15:11.818
No point in, you know...

15:11.820 --> 15:14.270
Hey, Vinny ever talk to you
about what it was like

15:14.272 --> 15:15.321
growing up here?
No.

15:15.323 --> 15:18.024
This building.

15:18.026 --> 15:20.410
So, what do you
want to do?

15:20.412 --> 15:23.997
Let's do what Vinny would do
if he were still here with us.

15:23.999 --> 15:25.231
Where are you going?

15:25.233 --> 15:27.367
Let's talk to Hector
Santiago's mom. Come on.

15:27.369 --> 15:29.202
I'm so sorry.

15:38.763 --> 15:41.581
Your detectives have been in
and out of here

15:41.583 --> 15:42.966
all night, asking questions.

15:42.968 --> 15:45.635
Please leave me alone.
I have no more to say.

15:45.637 --> 15:47.604
I'd like to help
your son Hector.

15:47.606 --> 15:49.088
Why would you do that?

15:49.090 --> 15:51.224
In the memory of
my late partner Vinny Cruz.

15:51.226 --> 15:53.526
I don't think
that Hector acted alone.

15:53.528 --> 15:55.595
Makes no difference
if he didn't.

15:55.597 --> 15:57.263
At least tell me how
I can talk to him.

15:57.265 --> 16:00.316
His English is very good,
I saw to that.

16:00.318 --> 16:01.651
I'm not talking
about his English.

16:01.653 --> 16:03.953
What you really want to know
how you can break him?

16:03.955 --> 16:06.439
No.
He's already broken.

16:06.441 --> 16:08.074
He's been broken all his life!

16:08.076 --> 16:11.711
Please, please, can I ask you
for some respect?

16:11.713 --> 16:13.613
I mean,
she's lost her son

16:13.615 --> 16:16.216
as surely
as if he'd been killed himself.

16:16.218 --> 16:18.251
We're trying to help you.

16:18.253 --> 16:20.253
Please, don't come back.

16:20.255 --> 16:21.721
I have lived here all my life,

16:21.723 --> 16:23.789
and I know every trick
in your book.

16:23.791 --> 16:25.675
I will show them
to the elevator.

16:25.677 --> 16:27.460
We can find our own way.

16:27.462 --> 16:29.145
We may not live in palaces,

16:29.147 --> 16:30.597
but that doesn't mean we don't

16:30.599 --> 16:32.265
have pride or manners.

16:32.267 --> 16:34.517
I'll show you to the elevator.

16:41.308 --> 16:43.309
You guys are unbelievable.

16:43.311 --> 16:44.644
What are you
talking about?

16:44.646 --> 16:46.746
Half the people
in there are tied

16:46.748 --> 16:48.198
to Los Lordes, right?

16:48.200 --> 16:49.148
Relatives, godparents...

16:49.150 --> 16:51.817
"We don't think
he acted alone.

16:51.819 --> 16:54.337
How can we get him
to give up the bangers""

16:54.339 --> 16:55.288
Thanks for the tip.

16:55.290 --> 16:57.123
I haven't given it to you.

17:00.127 --> 17:01.494
The radio calms Hector down.

17:01.496 --> 17:04.964
It relaxes him;
it lets him focus.

17:04.965 --> 17:06.999
The all-news stations.

17:07.001 --> 17:09.167
The radio? That's it?

17:09.170 --> 17:10.435
That's it.

17:10.438 --> 17:13.223
You got any idea of the
price of things around here?

17:13.224 --> 17:14.507
Okay.

17:14.509 --> 17:16.842
All right, I've already
wasted too much time

17:16.844 --> 17:18.394
walking you
to the elevator.

17:29.039 --> 17:30.690
Hey, Baez.

17:31.858 --> 17:33.409
Oh, and bring the boss.

17:35.462 --> 17:37.163
All right, these
are the dumps

17:37.165 --> 17:40.049
on Jorge's cellular
over the last three months.

17:40.051 --> 17:41.884
Highlighted blocks represent
a pattern of calls

17:41.886 --> 17:44.203
made every couple of weeks,
always clustered in the evening

17:44.205 --> 17:45.538
over a 48-hour period.

17:45.540 --> 17:47.840
They're always to five specific
numbers that trace back

17:47.842 --> 17:51.594
to Santana Ricky and a few
of the other top dogs.

17:51.596 --> 17:53.012
And they're made on the move.

17:53.014 --> 17:54.647
All the calls are all bouncing
off of different cell towers.

17:54.649 --> 17:56.849
Exactly. Now, the pattern
picked up again last night,

17:56.851 --> 17:59.519
but it went dead right around
the time the mayor got hit.

17:59.521 --> 18:01.387
All right, I'm sort
of following, but...

18:01.389 --> 18:02.772
They move guns and drugs, right?

18:02.774 --> 18:04.240
Well, what if it's all
orchestrated

18:04.242 --> 18:06.109
amongst these five
in a schedule that

18:06.111 --> 18:08.027
the pattern represents?

18:08.029 --> 18:09.996
The schedule got interrupted
by the little ruckus

18:09.998 --> 18:11.581
with the mayor
back at the ranch?

18:11.583 --> 18:12.898
It'd make sense.

18:12.900 --> 18:14.200
There's a lot to fill in.

18:14.202 --> 18:15.618
We start
with an eavesdropping warrant

18:15.620 --> 18:18.288
to go up on their phones,
we do a little surveillance,

18:18.290 --> 18:20.906
wait for them to make a pickup
or a drop, and boom.

18:20.908 --> 18:23.126
All the while hoping
Santana's stupid enough

18:23.128 --> 18:24.794
to just go about
business as usual?

18:24.796 --> 18:28.881
Not stupid enough, Sarge,
arrogant enough.

18:28.883 --> 18:31.184
<i>Detectives,</i>
<i>I'm Officer Reagan.</i>

18:31.186 --> 18:33.853
I'm Detective Crowley,
this is Detective Jones.

18:33.855 --> 18:36.139
You're the PC's kid--
I got that right?

18:36.141 --> 18:37.473
His son, yes.

18:37.475 --> 18:39.892
All right, and they said you
had some information for us.

18:39.894 --> 18:41.427
Well, it's a tip.

18:41.429 --> 18:44.897
Well, I hope it's a crowbar,
because this kid's nailed shut.

18:44.899 --> 18:49.035
The sergeant and I paid a visit
to Hector's mother's apartment,

18:49.037 --> 18:51.937
which was stocked full
of Los Lordes ears, apparently.

18:51.939 --> 18:55.491
The radio calms him down,
helps him focus.

18:55.493 --> 18:56.542
The all-news stations.

18:56.544 --> 18:57.943
The radio.

18:58.829 --> 19:00.713
Geez, that's good to know.

19:07.421 --> 19:08.788
What happened to him?

19:08.790 --> 19:10.473
Looks like he fell down.

19:10.475 --> 19:12.342
Bzzzzt!
Officer, just chain the monkey up

19:12.344 --> 19:14.260
in there, will you?
Ray-gun.

19:14.262 --> 19:16.095
What's that?

19:16.097 --> 19:18.464
Bzzzzt! Skinny Vinny's
friend. Ray-gun.

19:18.466 --> 19:20.266
That's-That's right, Hector.

19:20.268 --> 19:22.185
I'm Jamie Reagan.

19:23.237 --> 19:25.321
They told me it was a toy.

19:25.323 --> 19:26.472
Told you what was a toy?

19:26.474 --> 19:28.474
The heavy gun.

19:28.476 --> 19:30.109
They said it shot caps.

19:30.111 --> 19:31.611
It was supposed to be funny.

19:31.613 --> 19:33.246
Aw, save it for the tape.

19:34.498 --> 19:35.998
You know, we'll...
we'll take it from here.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.117
Take it to where?

19:38.119 --> 19:40.787
Thank you for that tip.

19:50.130 --> 19:52.832
Detectives Crowley and Jones
are trying to break the kid.

19:52.834 --> 19:54.183
What's the progress?

19:54.185 --> 19:55.167
Little to none.

19:55.169 --> 19:56.769
He's got some
serious handicap issues

19:56.771 --> 20:00.022
on top of he's another one born
allergic to cops.

20:00.024 --> 20:02.007
All his rights covered?

20:02.009 --> 20:04.360
Legal Aid attorney,
kid's got his meds,

20:04.362 --> 20:07.063
psych evaluation's been done,
all the bases are covered.

20:07.065 --> 20:08.564
Cover 'em twice.

20:08.566 --> 20:10.349
Our work in this case
will be defined

20:10.351 --> 20:13.853
in one way only--
extraordinary police work.

20:13.855 --> 20:15.354
None of this shock and awe crap.

20:15.356 --> 20:17.323
We're going by
the book as far as we can.

20:17.325 --> 20:18.524
What's that mean, Ed?

20:18.526 --> 20:20.076
There's no chapter in the book

20:20.078 --> 20:22.211
about an attempted assassination
of a mayor.

20:22.213 --> 20:23.880
Well, then we're writing it.

20:24.665 --> 20:26.249
I want cases against these thugs

20:26.251 --> 20:29.201
that the DA has no choice
but to prosecute.

20:29.203 --> 20:31.370
Not the kind we have
to ram down his throat.

20:31.372 --> 20:33.556
Airtight cases
on a silver platter.

20:33.558 --> 20:34.590
Copy that.

20:34.592 --> 20:37.093
The whole department is
to be leakproof

20:37.095 --> 20:39.429
both with the press
and city hall.

20:39.431 --> 20:41.147
Every syllable
goes through Garrett.

20:41.149 --> 20:44.350
Before you return any calls
or e-mails, talk to me first.

20:44.352 --> 20:46.319
This about Newhouse?

20:46.321 --> 20:49.739
This is about us doing our work
without any interference,

20:49.741 --> 20:52.158
any outside agendas
or any showboating.

20:52.160 --> 20:54.059
Understood?

20:54.061 --> 20:55.495
Yes, sir.

20:55.497 --> 20:56.562
Yes, sir.

21:01.401 --> 21:02.869
I don't get it.

21:02.871 --> 21:05.955
None of these guys are using
their cell phones.

21:08.575 --> 21:11.294
All right, tell the other
units to stand by.

21:11.296 --> 21:12.462
Copy that.

21:12.464 --> 21:15.631
Their phones have
been dead since 5:00.

21:15.633 --> 21:17.767
Probably swapped them out
for pre-paid ones.

21:17.769 --> 21:19.268
Yeah.

21:19.270 --> 21:22.104
Not stupid <i>or</i> arrogant.

21:28.145 --> 21:29.812
But on the move.

21:42.626 --> 21:44.577
We got eyes on Santana,

21:44.579 --> 21:46.412
but we don't know
where he's going.

21:57.257 --> 21:58.975
Come on.

21:58.977 --> 22:01.177
He's squaring the block.
He's made us.

22:01.179 --> 22:03.596
Or he's being cautious.
Hold on.

22:06.850 --> 22:08.768
Damn it. He's on the move.

22:11.605 --> 22:13.439
Reagan...
Hang on.

22:17.078 --> 22:18.694
Reagan!

22:21.865 --> 22:24.033
Damn it!

22:35.827 --> 22:37.545
<i>Commissioner.</i>

22:38.857 --> 22:41.058
Dad.

22:46.364 --> 22:50.100
Jamie has something he would
like to... talk to you about.

22:51.736 --> 22:53.770
And he needed to lawyer up?

22:53.772 --> 22:56.323
No, he just asked me
to come along.

22:56.325 --> 22:59.576
Well, I'm pretty
damn busy here, so...

22:59.578 --> 23:01.611
Look, I can't begin
to understand

23:01.613 --> 23:03.297
what you're dealing
with here or...

23:03.299 --> 23:04.781
Cut to it, son.

23:05.884 --> 23:08.552
I think the detectives
interrogating Hector Santiago

23:08.554 --> 23:09.887
are tuning him up.

23:09.889 --> 23:12.455
Or looking the other way
when his guards do.

23:13.274 --> 23:15.225
I don't pretend
to know

23:15.227 --> 23:17.627
what "getting it done" means
under these circumstances.

23:17.629 --> 23:20.480
Do you think an order like that
would've come from this office?

23:20.482 --> 23:22.349
I'm not saying that.

23:22.351 --> 23:24.084
Walks like it, talks like it.

23:24.086 --> 23:25.402
It's not my business.

23:25.404 --> 23:28.438
I am your PC,
and I am your father.

23:28.440 --> 23:30.824
How could it not be
your business?

23:33.611 --> 23:36.697
There's parts of you,
I have no idea what...

23:36.699 --> 23:38.866
goes on.

23:41.836 --> 23:45.505
I thought you should hear this
directly from Jamie.

23:51.012 --> 23:53.213
All right.

23:55.850 --> 23:59.386
Thank you for bringing this
to my attention, Officer Reagan.

23:59.388 --> 24:00.804
Yes, sir.

24:00.806 --> 24:04.358
How did you come to observe
Santiago's treatment?

24:04.360 --> 24:06.693
I brought the detectives
some information that I'd gained

24:06.695 --> 24:08.478
while on patrol
in the Bitterman Houses.

24:08.480 --> 24:10.147
And Santiago was present?

24:10.149 --> 24:11.114
Yes.

24:11.116 --> 24:12.449
Did he remember you?

24:12.451 --> 24:13.317
Respond to you?

24:13.319 --> 24:14.952
Very much so.

24:14.954 --> 24:17.704
<i>Looks like he's pulling</i>
<i>into a parking lot,</i>

24:17.706 --> 24:19.039
<i>middle of the block.</i>

24:19.041 --> 24:21.691
<i>Keep him in sight.</i>
<i>We're almost there.</i>

24:21.693 --> 24:23.860
He's right here.

24:42.096 --> 24:44.231
Where the hell is Santana?
Dropped him uptown.

24:44.233 --> 24:46.516
So you've been driving
this vehicle all night?

24:46.518 --> 24:48.685
No, he picked me up
at my cousin's

24:48.687 --> 24:49.987
and then I dropped him.

24:49.989 --> 24:51.738
Uh-huh. Why are you
parking it here?

24:51.740 --> 24:53.991
He said this is where he wanted
his car for the night.

24:53.993 --> 24:55.192
What the hell is this?

24:57.228 --> 24:58.495
Would you open
the trunk, please?

24:58.497 --> 24:59.863
Open it yourself.

24:59.865 --> 25:01.231
Long as I got
your permission.

25:01.233 --> 25:02.399
Actually...

25:02.401 --> 25:04.084
get a warrant.

25:04.086 --> 25:06.569
I can do that.

25:10.541 --> 25:15.462
We need a warrant, partner.

25:15.464 --> 25:17.014
<i>...is still heavy getting up</i>

25:17.016 --> 25:19.016
toward Fort Hamilton Parkway;
a crash there is now cleared...

25:19.018 --> 25:20.517
Okay, Hector,
let's try this again.

25:20.519 --> 25:23.253
What was the name
of the guy who told you that

25:23.255 --> 25:26.473
the gun was a fake?

25:26.475 --> 25:28.225
Come on.
Help me help you, Hector.

25:28.227 --> 25:30.060
This is a waste of time.

25:30.062 --> 25:31.094
I'm with you.

25:31.096 --> 25:32.612
Let's just give it
a few more minutes.

25:32.614 --> 25:34.431
No, no, no.
I gotta get some air.

25:34.433 --> 25:35.315
Take an umbrella.

25:35.317 --> 25:36.283
What?

25:36.285 --> 25:38.468
Barometric pressure
8.0 and rising,

25:38.470 --> 25:39.936
winds from the
southeast at ten

25:39.938 --> 25:41.271
to 15 knots,

25:41.273 --> 25:42.622
chance of rain 90%

25:42.624 --> 25:43.690
with a likelihood
of severe thunderstorms,

25:43.692 --> 25:44.825
a coastal flood

25:44.827 --> 25:47.160
advisory is in effect
until noon tomorrow.

25:47.162 --> 25:49.246
Traffic in 60 seconds.

25:55.336 --> 25:57.287
Hector.

25:57.289 --> 25:59.339
You're pretty good
at remembering some stuff,

25:59.341 --> 26:01.508
am I right?

26:01.510 --> 26:03.760
What did the guy who gave you
the gun say to you?

26:03.762 --> 26:05.795
Hector, here.

26:05.797 --> 26:07.264
Under my chair.

26:07.266 --> 26:09.232
Okay, and what did he say

26:09.234 --> 26:11.068
when he told you
that he wanted you

26:11.070 --> 26:12.519
to fire the gun in the meeting?

26:12.521 --> 26:14.588
It ain't real, Hector.

26:14.590 --> 26:15.522
It's just for fun, man.

26:15.524 --> 26:17.657
Like <i>Grand Theft Auto:</i>
<i>Vice City.</i>

26:17.659 --> 26:19.159
But, uh...

26:19.161 --> 26:20.977
you don't remember his name?

26:21.812 --> 26:24.114
Hector...

26:24.116 --> 26:25.782
you remember
Skinny Vinny, Ray-Gun,

26:25.784 --> 26:27.817
that kind of thing.
Why is that?

26:28.669 --> 26:30.837
They don't scare me.

26:31.789 --> 26:33.707
Hector, can you tell us
what he looked like?

26:33.709 --> 26:36.376
Mm...

26:36.378 --> 26:37.711
scary.

26:37.713 --> 26:39.096
Okay, but what else?

26:39.098 --> 26:40.881
Mm...

26:40.883 --> 26:42.849
black curly hair,

26:42.851 --> 26:44.551
brown eyes,

26:44.553 --> 26:46.636
Los Lordes tat

26:46.638 --> 26:49.189
here, black T,

26:49.191 --> 26:51.525
gold watch, locs...

26:51.527 --> 26:52.609
Locs? What...

26:52.611 --> 26:53.977
Low-cost sunglasses.

26:53.979 --> 26:55.862
Red sneakers, rosary beads,

26:55.864 --> 26:57.864
red bandana here.

26:58.733 --> 27:00.283
Orlando?

27:01.469 --> 27:03.686
Santana's
foot soldier?

27:06.157 --> 27:07.908
Orlando.

27:14.882 --> 27:17.884
Keep it moving.

27:51.953 --> 27:53.236
Got the warrant.

27:53.238 --> 27:55.005
Good. Keep an eye
on the entrance, all right?

27:55.007 --> 27:56.739
There's been a lot of interest
in this vehicle.

27:56.741 --> 28:00.177
Why don't we just flatbed it
back back to the command?

28:00.179 --> 28:01.962
No, just give me a few minutes,
all right?

28:01.964 --> 28:03.096
Reagan.

28:03.098 --> 28:04.347
Come on!

28:04.349 --> 28:06.183
Look, I'm a Porsche fan, okay?

28:06.185 --> 28:10.053
Same way, say, a...
guy who owns a canoe's a...

28:10.055 --> 28:11.721
big fan of yachts.

28:11.723 --> 28:13.974
Dreamer of dreams.

28:13.976 --> 28:16.109
These things are built
to very specific

28:16.111 --> 28:18.094
tolerances of fit and finish,

28:18.096 --> 28:20.313
down to the millimeter.
If anything's out of whack

28:20.315 --> 28:22.616
in this vehicle,
I'm gonna find it, partner.

28:28.456 --> 28:30.707
Like this. Come here.

28:32.810 --> 28:34.794
This door panel's
t up to spec.

28:39.333 --> 28:40.950
And I don't think this...

28:40.952 --> 28:42.552
is a factory option.

28:42.554 --> 28:45.972
That's a street value
of a dozen Porsches.

28:55.800 --> 28:58.235
Private meeting.
Why don't you beat it?

28:58.237 --> 29:00.270
I said beat it. Move.

29:00.272 --> 29:02.239
You, too.
I'll see you later.

29:04.659 --> 29:07.027
Well, we found
a very large quantity of drugs

29:07.029 --> 29:08.461
in your vehicle, Santana.

29:08.463 --> 29:10.330
Yeah, well, I don't know
how they got there.

29:10.332 --> 29:11.798
Yeah, you do.

29:11.800 --> 29:14.801
But being as it wasn't in your
possession when we found it,

29:14.803 --> 29:17.437
legally we can't charge you.

29:17.439 --> 29:19.339
Nona, however, well...

29:19.341 --> 29:21.608
It was in her
possession,

29:21.610 --> 29:23.443
and we will charge her.

29:23.445 --> 29:26.363
We picked her up,
what, an hour ago?

29:26.365 --> 29:28.231
She's really upset with you.

29:28.233 --> 29:30.200
She knows nothing about nothing.

29:30.202 --> 29:31.551
Let her go.

29:31.553 --> 29:35.805
I don't think you know much
about anything either.

29:36.891 --> 29:38.208
In fact...

29:38.210 --> 29:40.193
this would be
a good time...

29:40.195 --> 29:43.413
for you to do the right thing
for once in your stinkin' life.

29:43.415 --> 29:44.814
Yeah? What's that?

29:44.816 --> 29:46.983
Don't let Nona do a bid for you.

29:46.985 --> 29:48.068
A 20-year bid.

29:48.070 --> 29:49.636
Yeah, right.

29:49.638 --> 29:51.271
You really that cold?

29:51.273 --> 29:52.105
No, sweetheart...

29:52.107 --> 29:52.806
Hey!

29:53.474 --> 29:54.808
She's a detective.

29:54.810 --> 29:55.976
Oh.

30:00.181 --> 30:02.198
You see, if I take the hit
every single time

30:02.200 --> 30:04.634
one of my crew members
gets busted,

30:04.636 --> 30:08.221
I'd have been locked up
since I was, like, nine.

30:08.223 --> 30:09.689
Great.
Now, if you'll

30:09.691 --> 30:11.391
excuse me, Detectives,

30:11.393 --> 30:13.209
I got a business to run.

30:14.545 --> 30:15.929
You don't have the balls
to go down there

30:15.931 --> 30:17.180
and tell her yourself, do you?

30:17.182 --> 30:19.566
You booked her,

30:19.568 --> 30:23.019
and you seem to like
playing her daddy,

30:23.021 --> 30:25.355
so I'll leave that to you.

30:25.357 --> 30:27.991
You appointed yourself
Nona and Noni's protector

30:27.993 --> 30:29.909
since they were
little kids.

30:29.911 --> 30:32.028
You failed.

30:32.030 --> 30:35.248
Now stop trying
to take it out on me.

30:37.084 --> 30:39.669
I'm gonna talk to her.

30:39.671 --> 30:42.589
And I'm gonna tell her
a little story

30:42.591 --> 30:44.574
about a bad little man.

30:44.576 --> 30:45.575
It's a free country.

30:45.577 --> 30:47.560
Not for long.

30:47.562 --> 30:49.763
Not for you.

31:08.932 --> 31:10.933
This is Detective Reagan
from the 5-4 Squad.

31:10.935 --> 31:12.535
The inmate Nona Palmeira

31:12.537 --> 31:15.705
we need to move to protective
custody right away.

31:15.707 --> 31:18.158
Nona Palmeira,
she was arraigned and remanded

31:18.160 --> 31:20.577
earlier this evening--
I need her moved!

31:21.612 --> 31:23.279
What?

31:28.419 --> 31:30.136
What hospital?

31:42.895 --> 31:44.749
How is she?
She took a shiv in her back,

31:44.750 --> 31:47.468
another one in her ribs.
It was a set-up.

31:47.470 --> 31:49.853
Either that or she makes
enemies real fast.

31:49.855 --> 31:53.357
Hey. Look, I'm sorry.
For what?

31:53.359 --> 31:54.475
I should've known
he would do this.

31:54.477 --> 31:56.193
Who?
Santana.

31:56.195 --> 31:57.478
It was four bitches,

31:57.480 --> 31:58.812
Reagan.
Nona...

31:58.814 --> 32:01.031
Please stand back.

32:12.710 --> 32:15.045
Reagan. Here.

32:15.047 --> 32:17.664
Thanks. What do you got?

32:17.666 --> 32:21.251
One of the four inmates involved
received an outside call

32:21.253 --> 32:24.755
at 2320 last night, from a Hispanic male
Mm-hmm.

32:24.757 --> 32:29.059
telling her to "take car""
of Nona Palmeira.

32:29.928 --> 32:31.929
And the C.O.s did nothing.

32:31.931 --> 32:34.515
The officer monitoring the call
took it to mean,

32:34.517 --> 32:36.600
you know, "watch over her."
Great.

32:36.602 --> 32:39.520
Who's the inmate?
Uh, one...

32:39.522 --> 32:42.739
Rosa Escobar, in for assault.

32:42.741 --> 32:45.409
Place of residence, unit 5-5F,

32:45.411 --> 32:46.944
the Bitterman Houses.

32:46.946 --> 32:48.478
Of course.

32:52.667 --> 32:54.585
Rosa Escobar
received a call

32:54.587 --> 32:58.005
from a cell phone which traces
back to a Carlos Villalobos,

32:58.007 --> 32:59.540
a lawyer

32:59.542 --> 33:01.708
who answers to Santana.

33:01.710 --> 33:05.929
With the message to quote,
"take care of you,"

33:05.931 --> 33:07.764
unquote.

33:07.766 --> 33:11.468
I want you to see if you can
follow me, okay, Nona?

33:11.470 --> 33:15.272
You got shanked in jail
on Santana's order,

33:15.274 --> 33:17.458
where you
were being held

33:17.460 --> 33:20.360
for taking the fall
for <i>his</i> narcotics possession,

33:20.362 --> 33:23.530
approximately ten days
after you buried your sister,

33:23.532 --> 33:26.283
who threw herself off of
a roof with your nephew

33:26.285 --> 33:28.619
rather than live the life
that the Los Lordes

33:28.621 --> 33:30.654
had sentenced
the both of you to.

33:30.656 --> 33:32.656
Does that sound
about right?

33:34.409 --> 33:35.926
Okay.

33:35.928 --> 33:38.662
So what the hell are you gonna
do about it, Nona?

33:39.497 --> 33:41.582
What are you offering me?

33:41.584 --> 33:45.869
I am offering you the same thing
I offered you as a kid.

33:46.971 --> 33:49.056
I'm gonna do everything
in my power to see to it

33:49.058 --> 33:52.926
that you can have
a fair shot at a normal life.

33:52.928 --> 33:55.212
I know I failed the last time,

33:55.214 --> 33:57.397
and I don't want to fail again,

33:57.399 --> 33:59.049
but it's up to you.

33:59.051 --> 34:01.602
You got to give
me something

34:01.604 --> 34:03.353
that I can use to help you,

34:03.355 --> 34:06.690
or there's nothing I can do.

34:06.692 --> 34:09.576
And I will walk away
and I won't look back.

34:14.331 --> 34:15.732
Help me, Nona.

34:33.484 --> 34:35.085
Okay.

34:37.472 --> 34:40.440
The DA is still waffling,

34:40.442 --> 34:44.277
but he has indicated
that he is willing to allow

34:44.280 --> 34:48.232
Hector Santiago's testimony
as eyewitness testimony

34:48.234 --> 34:51.534
as long as it is corroborated
by Nona Palmeira's.

34:51.536 --> 34:53.670
Well, you know
I have to ask, Frank:

34:53.672 --> 34:55.205
Was there coercion?

34:55.206 --> 34:56.373
Yes.

34:57.809 --> 35:02.879
She was attacked in prison
on Los Lordes orders.

35:02.881 --> 35:06.250
We flipped her this morning
in the hospital.

35:06.252 --> 35:07.417
And the kid?

35:08.269 --> 35:11.221
There was evidence to suggest

35:11.223 --> 35:16.009
that one of the lead detectives
on the case had engaged in,

35:16.011 --> 35:17.928
or allowed to occur,

35:17.930 --> 35:21.515
some physical abuse
of the suspect.

35:21.517 --> 35:24.067
As soon as it was brought
to my attention,

35:24.069 --> 35:26.603
he and his partner
were removed from the case

35:26.605 --> 35:28.572
and placed
on modified assignment.

35:28.574 --> 35:33.527
So is this clean
in the NYPD sense or...

35:33.529 --> 35:36.196
clean in the larger sense?

35:37.031 --> 35:38.448
Both.

35:41.552 --> 35:45.155
There's one other thing: I...

35:45.157 --> 35:48.508
don't usually go in
for theatrics,

35:48.510 --> 35:52.846
but in this case,
I'd like to make an exception.

35:52.848 --> 35:56.717
A show of force--
an orchestrated sweep.

35:56.719 --> 35:58.268
To what end?

35:58.270 --> 36:01.171
To give the people
what they want.

36:01.173 --> 36:03.607
Courtesy of Mayor Carter Poole.

36:04.475 --> 36:06.676
Thank you, Frank.

36:14.319 --> 36:15.869
Thank you, Carter.

36:15.871 --> 36:18.538
I wish I could be there
standing with you.

36:19.407 --> 36:21.575
So do I.

36:23.411 --> 36:25.662
At 0600 hours this morning

36:25.664 --> 36:29.883
a joint task force consisting
of the Detective Bureau,

36:29.885 --> 36:31.868
the Narcotics Division,

36:31.870 --> 36:34.438
<i>ESU, the Warrant Squad,</i>

36:34.440 --> 36:36.573
<i>the Gang Division</i>

36:36.575 --> 36:39.810
<i>and patrol--</i>

36:39.812 --> 36:41.745
armed with warrants for arrests

36:41.747 --> 36:45.949
on charges including conspiracy
<i>to murder in the cases</i>

36:45.951 --> 36:50.020
of police officer Vincent Cruz
<i>and Mayor Carter Poole,</i>

36:50.022 --> 36:53.106
<i>narcotics possession</i>
<i>with intent to distribute,</i>

36:53.108 --> 36:56.827
<i>enterprise corruption</i>
<i>and racketeering</i>

36:56.829 --> 37:01.164
<i>and a number</i>
<i>of other serious charges--</i>

37:01.166 --> 37:04.418
<i>conducted a sweep of</i>
<i>the Bitterman Housing Projects</i>

37:04.420 --> 37:08.038
<i>and arrested 47 members</i>
<i>and associates</i>

37:08.040 --> 37:10.573
<i>of the Los Lordes</i>
<i>criminal organization,</i>

37:10.575 --> 37:12.626
<i>including their head.</i>

37:26.558 --> 37:30.143
<i>These arrests were made</i>
<i>with information</i>

37:30.145 --> 37:33.530
<i>given by the residents</i>
<i>of the Bitterman Projects,</i>

37:33.532 --> 37:37.534
<i>at their own risk,</i>
<i>with no promise of reward,</i>

37:37.536 --> 37:39.703
<i>other than</i>
<i>full NYPD cooperation</i>

37:39.705 --> 37:44.374
<i>in restoring law and order</i>
<i>to their community.</i>

37:44.376 --> 37:46.493
<i>I would like to note</i>

37:46.495 --> 37:49.212
that this operation was carried
<i>out with the full input,</i>

37:49.214 --> 37:53.616
<i>and by design of,</i>
<i>Mayor Carter Poole,</i>

37:53.618 --> 37:55.669
<i>with the explicit intent</i>
<i>of conducting</i>

37:55.671 --> 37:59.673
the investigations and arrests
<i>in such a manner</i>

37:59.675 --> 38:03.977
<i>as to build trust</i>
<i>between the NYPD</i>

38:03.979 --> 38:06.646
<i>and the Bitterman community--</i>

38:06.648 --> 38:08.965
<i>a trust that has been absent,</i>

38:08.967 --> 38:14.271
<i>on both sides,</i>
<i>for far too long.</i>

38:21.779 --> 38:23.780
Bless us, O Lord,
for these, Thy gifts,

38:23.782 --> 38:25.415
which we are about to receive

38:25.417 --> 38:27.701
from Thy bounty,
through Christ, our Lord. Amen.

38:27.703 --> 38:29.986
Amen.

38:29.988 --> 38:31.204
Amen.

38:31.206 --> 38:33.757
Hope He can hear us.
Amen.

38:33.759 --> 38:35.342
He can always hear you.

38:35.344 --> 38:39.129
But you have to listen very
carefully for His response.

38:40.164 --> 38:43.467
And hear our prayers
for Carter Poole.

38:43.469 --> 38:44.667
And his family.

38:44.669 --> 38:45.936
And his recovery.

38:45.938 --> 38:47.270
Amen.

38:47.272 --> 38:48.355
Okay to pass?

38:48.357 --> 38:49.606
Please.

38:50.808 --> 38:54.060
Danny and I are taking
my sister's house in Quogue

38:54.062 --> 38:55.612
the second week of July.

38:55.614 --> 38:56.897
Quogue.

38:56.899 --> 38:58.815
The Irish Riviera.

38:58.817 --> 39:00.183
Biggest bluefish I ever caught

39:00.185 --> 39:02.369
was off the jetty
just east of there.

39:02.371 --> 39:04.621
Are you, um,
trying to rub it in?

39:04.623 --> 39:06.456
No.

39:06.458 --> 39:07.624
I'm bringing it up

39:07.626 --> 39:10.377
because the house next door
is for rent, too.

39:10.379 --> 39:11.962
Same week.

39:11.964 --> 39:12.963
Nice place.

39:12.965 --> 39:14.831
Five bedrooms,

39:14.833 --> 39:16.583
comes with a boat
and a slip.

39:17.635 --> 39:19.970
Are you asking
what I think you're asking?

39:19.972 --> 39:24.758
Can I just say that I have often
wondered what kind of

39:24.760 --> 39:26.376
fantastic woman
has dinner

39:26.378 --> 39:30.146
with her in-laws every single
Sunday without complaint.

39:30.148 --> 39:32.432
Thank you, Frank.

39:32.434 --> 39:34.651
Look, I know
I'm not the matriarch,

39:34.653 --> 39:36.903
but I am a mother and a nurse,

39:36.905 --> 39:39.889
and I think it's the perfect
prescription for this family.

39:39.891 --> 39:41.191
No cases

39:41.193 --> 39:42.859
except for cold beer,

39:42.861 --> 39:46.563
and no shifts except for who
digs the next batch of clams.

39:46.565 --> 39:48.532
You serious?

39:48.534 --> 39:50.116
Yeah. But it's coming up,

39:50.118 --> 39:53.336
so you got to lock in
some vacation for that week.

39:53.338 --> 39:56.406
Well, I'm kind of moved.

39:56.408 --> 39:58.592
Well, I'm the only one at this
table who, when I cut myself,

39:58.594 --> 40:00.093
I don't bleed NYPD blue,

40:00.095 --> 40:02.379
but from where
I'm sitting...

40:03.214 --> 40:05.248
...you guys need
a break from it.

40:05.250 --> 40:07.100
How would that be a break
from it? We'd just be moving

40:07.102 --> 40:08.751
the family business
to the beach for a week,

40:08.753 --> 40:09.853
way I see it.

40:09.855 --> 40:11.021
Yeah, but this way

40:11.023 --> 40:12.606
you can keep tabs on each other.

40:12.608 --> 40:16.226
And anybody who talks shop
gets kicked off of the island.

40:19.146 --> 40:20.447
So what do you say?

40:20.449 --> 40:21.781
We can take you crabbing.

40:21.783 --> 40:23.933
- We know a great spot.
- You do?

40:23.935 --> 40:26.403
Yeah.

40:26.405 --> 40:28.771
Danny, you okay with this?

40:28.773 --> 40:30.707
Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

40:30.709 --> 40:32.709
We don't have to pay for
the other house though, do we?

40:32.711 --> 40:34.761
No, they'd chip in.
Oh, yeah.

40:34.763 --> 40:36.746
Then of course I am.

40:36.748 --> 40:38.915
What do you guys say?

40:40.751 --> 40:42.752
I'll bite.

40:42.754 --> 40:44.087
Yeah?

40:47.508 --> 40:51.177
Deal then?

41:03.691 --> 41:05.692
A week at the beach.

41:05.694 --> 41:07.611
Amen to that, too.
