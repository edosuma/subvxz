YOU BROKE
YOUR MOTHER'S HEART!

17:12.406 --> 17:13.698
SHE'S UP THERE CRYING

17:13.866 --> 17:15.992
ABOUT HOW
YOU'RE ALL GROWN UP

17:16.160 --> 17:18.661
AND YOU DON'T
NEED HER ANYMORE.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.455
WELL, THAT...

17:20.622 --> 17:22.290
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

17:22.458 --> 17:23.791

17:23.959 --> 17:27.545
YOU'RE A HELPLESS
IDIOT!

TO NEED HELP

17:32.259 --> 17:33.468
WITH MY HOMEWORK.

17:33.635 --> 17:37.722
OH, NO, NO ONE GIVES
A CRAP ABOUT THAT.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.807
OKAY. OH! I COULD PRETEND

17:47.649 --> 17:49.567
RIGHT. I COULD SAY
I HAVE A FEVER.

17:49.735 --> 17:51.110
OR BETTER YET, WE COULD
GO OUT TO THE GARAGE,

17:51.278 --> 17:55.782
I HIT YA IN THE ELBOW
WITH A BASEBALL BAT.

17:58.744 --> 18:01.454
I'M GONNA STICK
WITH THE FEVER.

18:01.622 --> 18:03.206
YOU WANNA GO THROUGH LIFE
DOING EVERYTHING HALF-ASSED,

18:03.373 --> 18:06.667
THAT'S YOUR DECISION, SON.

OH, GOODY. THEY'RE NOT FAT.
THEY'RE JUST OLD.

18:40.994 --> 18:42.411
THEN YOU SHOULD
BE HOT!

18:42.579 --> 18:44.664

18:51.380 --> 18:52.547
