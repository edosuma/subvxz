NOW, DAWN IS THE MAIN
BENEFICIARY OF THE POLICY.

36:06.290 --> 36:07.871
WHEN SHE'S ARRESTED,

36:08.042 --> 36:09.703
THAT SHOULD SAVE YOU
A LOT OF MONEY.

36:09.877 --> 36:10.866
DAWN DIDN'T KILL GEORGE.

36:12.630 --> 36:13.915
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

36:14.131 --> 36:15.962
DAWN AND CASSIE
WERE OUT OF TOWN.

36:17.718 --> 36:19.549
THAT MEANS
IT MUST'VE BEEN YOUR FRIEND...

36:19.720 --> 36:21.005
NICK HOLMAN.

36:21.180 --> 36:23.842
HE'S ALWAYS HAD HIS EYE
ON TAKING OVER THIS FARM.

36:24.058 --> 36:26.219
HE SEEMS PRETTY COMFORTABLE
TAKING GEORGE'S PROPERTY.

36:27.144 --> 36:30.807
MAYBE HE TOOK GEORGE'S COLT,
AS WELL...

36:32.274 --> 36:33.684
AND SHOT HIM WITH IT.

36:35.110 --> 36:36.725
MAYBE GEORGE
HAD AN ACCIDENT?

36:37.321 --> 36:38.857
MAYBE HE DROPPED THE GUN.

36:39.073 --> 36:41.689
SEE, IF IT WAS AN ACCIDENT,
THE COLT WOULD BE HERE.

36:41.867 --> 36:42.822
IT WASN'T.

36:43.035 --> 36:44.571
IT'S NOT AT HIS HOUSE
EITHER.

36:46.121 --> 36:48.032
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I DID FIND
AT HIS HOUSE.

36:50.417 --> 36:51.668
GEORGE'S CELLPHONE.

36:53.504 --> 36:55.040
YOU WERE THE LAST PERSON
HE CALLED.

36:55.255 --> 36:58.383
PHONE RECORDS SAY THE CALL
LASTED FOR 12 MINUTES.

36:59.426 --> 37:02.338
WERE YOU TRYING TO TALK HIM
OUT OF ANOTHER SUICIDE ATTEMPT?

37:02.513 --> 37:04.720
HE SWALLOWED SLEEPING PILLS
THE FIRST TIME.

37:04.890 --> 37:07.927
WE HAVEN'T RUN A TOX SCREEN YET
TO SEE WHAT IT WAS THIS TIME,

37:08.143 --> 37:10.350
BUT I COULD CALL THE HOSPITAL
RIGHT AWAY AND ASK FOR ONE,

37:10.562 --> 37:12.018
AND --
NO.

37:12.231 --> 37:13.391
DON'T.

37:16.819 --> 37:19.151
IT WAS THE SLEEPING PILLS
AGAIN.

37:20.072 --> 37:21.027
GEORGE, WAKE UP!

37:21.240 --> 37:22.776
I'M CALLING THE AMBULANCE!

37:22.991 --> 37:24.322
TOO LATE.

37:25.577 --> 37:27.363
I TOOK ALL OF THEM.

37:29.331 --> 37:31.242
YOU'RE A GOOD FRIEND, TY.

37:31.458 --> 37:32.743
YOU WERE RIGHT.

37:34.378 --> 37:36.164
I DID IT ALL WRONG
THE LAST TIME.

37:36.714 --> 37:38.079
WALT:
WHAT DID HE MEAN?

37:38.298 --> 37:40.425
WHEN HE FIRST
TRIED TO KILL HIMSELF,

37:40.634 --> 37:42.170
I TRIED TO TALK SOME SENSE
INTO HIM.

37:42.886 --> 37:44.001
WHAT'D YOU TELL HIM?

37:44.179 --> 37:45.680
THAT IF HE KILLED HIMSELF,

37:45.889 --> 37:48.801
DAWN AND CASSIE WOULD NEVER
COLLECT ON THE INSURANCE POLICY.

37:49.309 --> 37:52.301
WHAT I MEANT WAS THAT SUICIDE
WOULDN'T SOLVE ANYTHING.

37:52.521 --> 37:54.102
BUT HE HEARD
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

37:54.732 --> 37:57.519
I WANT YOU TO SHOOT ME.
WHAT?!

37:57.735 --> 38:00.568
AFTER I'M DEAD,
SO IT LOOKS LIKE A MURDER

38:00.779 --> 38:02.861
AND MY GIRLS CAN GET
THAT MONEY --

38:04.199 --> 38:05.234
JUST LIKE YOU SAID.

38:06.577 --> 38:12.288
GET RID OF THE PILLS AND THE GUN
WHEN YOU'RE DONE.

38:12.499 --> 38:14.831
I'M ASKING YOU AS MY FRIEND.

38:17.254 --> 38:19.245
THIS IS THE ONLY WAY I...

38:19.465 --> 38:22.047
THIS IS THE ONLY WAY
I CAN SAVE THE FARM.

38:27.890 --> 38:29.346
PLEASE.

38:32.478 --> 38:34.264
GEORGE.

38:34.480 --> 38:35.970
GEORGE!

38:41.820 --> 38:44.778
DO YOU KNOW HOW OFTEN
MY COMPANY HAS DENIED CLAIMS

38:44.990 --> 38:46.776
BECAUSE OF SOME LOOPHOLE?

38:47.743 --> 38:49.984
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES
I'VE TAKEN FROM PEOPLE

38:50.204 --> 38:52.695
SO MUCH MORE
THAN I'VE GIVEN BACK?

38:53.874 --> 38:55.865
GEORGE LINDER WAS
ONE OF THE MOST DECENT,

38:56.084 --> 38:57.290
HONORABLE MEN I KNEW.

38:58.170 --> 38:59.706
AND NOW...

38:59.922 --> 39:03.130
HIS FAMILY WAS GONNA LOSE
EVERYTHING HE STOOD FOR.

I ALWAYS CLAIMED TO BE

39:24.029 --> 39:25.690
THAT'S SOME KIND OF STORY.

39:27.241 --> 39:28.981
BUT A LITTLE FARFETCHED
FOR MY TASTE.

39:32.704 --> 39:35.787
YOU CAN TELL DAWN AND CASSIE
ALL ABOUT IT IF YOU WANT.

39:36.708 --> 39:38.573
BUT I THINK
I'M JUST GONNA DECLARE THIS

39:38.752 --> 39:40.458
AN UNSOLVED HOMICIDE.

41:03.587 --> 41:04.918
[SIGHS]

41:06.548 --> 41:08.163
I DON'T WANT TO READ THIS.

41:09.009 --> 41:11.341
I DIDN'T WANT TO WRITE IT,
BUT...

41:12.512 --> 41:13.922
I DID.

41:16.808 --> 41:18.594
SO NOW YOU HAVE TO OPEN IT.

41:47.631 --> 41:49.292
THIS IS ABOUT BRANCH?

41:50.133 --> 41:51.748
YOU NEED TO READ IT
ALL THE WAY THROUGH.

41:53.512 --> 41:55.423
THERE'S NO WAY
HE SHOULD BE CARRYING

41:55.597 --> 41:57.758
A BADGE AND A GUN RIGHT NOW.

41:59.893 --> 42:02.726
HE'S A TIME BOMB
