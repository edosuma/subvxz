00:21.021 --> 00:22.564
<i>Previously on </i>Manifest…

00:22.647 --> 00:25.984
I'm Aaron Glover. I'm a journalist.
My podcast is <i>828-Gate.</i>

00:26.067 --> 00:29.154
I don't know what holy grail
the major is closing in on,

00:29.237 --> 00:33.408
but I will not let my family be
collateral damage in her quest.

00:33.491 --> 00:35.577
How about we stay up here
and forget the world?

00:35.660 --> 00:37.954
But I'm assuming you have
something to get back to?

00:38.038 --> 00:39.164
I'm not exactly sure.

00:39.247 --> 00:41.958
I had a Calling.
You're not safe with me. You need to run.

00:42.042 --> 00:44.544
I am sending an angel
to guard you along the way.

00:44.627 --> 00:48.256
-I think she may have already been sent.
-What are you waiting for? Go to her.

00:50.216 --> 00:51.051
Zeke.

00:51.718 --> 00:53.511
-I'm still alive, right?
-Yeah.

00:54.554 --> 00:56.931
I was just starting
to finally get over you.

00:57.015 --> 00:58.308
Please don't do this.

00:58.391 --> 01:00.101
He was supposed to be gone, Mick.

01:00.769 --> 01:01.853
We should talk.

01:10.653 --> 01:12.864
"To every thing, there is a season."

01:13.990 --> 01:16.826
"And a time to every purpose
under heaven."

01:17.786 --> 01:21.539
"A time to be born, and a time to die…"

01:37.972 --> 01:39.349
"A time to laugh,

01:39.933 --> 01:41.309
a time to mourn,

01:42.143 --> 01:43.686
and a time to dance."

02:33.319 --> 02:35.321
So the Registry
just can't get enough of you, huh?

02:35.405 --> 02:37.532
-Weren't you just there?
-Yeah, last week.

02:38.032 --> 02:39.993
You're only required
to report once a month.

02:40.076 --> 02:42.245
I know. Something, uh…
something must be up.

02:44.330 --> 02:45.957
You think this is about Henry Kim?

02:46.791 --> 02:50.044
I hope not. No one's supposed to know
he's alive, let alone in the city.

02:50.128 --> 02:51.045
Yeah.

02:52.714 --> 02:54.716
Don't wanna go.

02:56.092 --> 02:57.677
If you skip a Registry summons,

02:57.760 --> 02:59.721
you'll be eating tomorrow's breakfast
behind bars.

02:59.804 --> 03:01.306
And they don't serve fresh-squeezed.

03:01.389 --> 03:04.559
Well, I kind of liked it better
when everyone thought we were miracles.

03:04.642 --> 03:06.769
-Well, I think you're a miracle.
-Oh.

03:09.647 --> 03:10.481
Hey.

03:11.566 --> 03:12.483
Tough night?

03:13.860 --> 03:17.113
Look, we're here for you if you need us.
We love you.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.406
Love you too.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.950
-Okay, I gotta go.
-Bye.

03:30.585 --> 03:31.711
It's Saanvi.

03:32.712 --> 03:35.048
-Hey, uh, can I come in?
-Be my guest.

03:35.131 --> 03:35.965
Thanks.

03:36.549 --> 03:39.260
Guess what was on the black box recording?
No, I mean, you can't--

03:39.344 --> 03:42.180
You're never gonna be able to guess, but…
Okay, just go.

03:42.263 --> 03:43.640
-Uh…
-Okay, I'm just gonna tell you.

03:43.723 --> 03:48.561
During the part where turbulence hits,
you can hear Capt. Daly crying for help.

03:48.645 --> 03:51.105
-Just like--
-Gupta heard at Eureka two years ago.

03:51.189 --> 03:53.399
-How is that possible?
-That's what we need to find out.

03:53.483 --> 03:55.193
You know who might be interested in Daly?

03:55.276 --> 03:58.112
I don't think my dad is interested
in hearing about anything.

03:58.196 --> 04:00.156
Especially if I'm the one saying it.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.658
Of course he's interested.

04:01.741 --> 04:04.827
Ben knew Daly better than anyone.
He might remember something.

04:04.911 --> 04:08.039
I don't know.
You haven't seen him in a few months.

04:08.665 --> 04:09.791
He's gotten worse.

04:11.167 --> 04:14.295
When he stopped responding to texts,
I figured he wanted to be alone.

04:14.379 --> 04:17.423
-Maybe that wasn't a good idea.
-I don't think he knows what he wants.

04:18.883 --> 04:21.177
Okay, just be ready.

04:28.351 --> 04:31.104
<i>Aaron Glover. Again.</i>
<i>I'm not giving up, Ben.</i>

04:31.187 --> 04:34.232
<i>Really want you on the show.</i>
<i>You won't even have to leave the house.</i>

04:34.315 --> 04:36.025
<i>I'll come to you. I'm gonna keep calling.</i>

04:38.152 --> 04:39.612
Ben, hi.

04:48.162 --> 04:49.455
It's really good to see you.

04:50.957 --> 04:52.667
Look, we have some huge news.

04:53.334 --> 04:56.129
Not only do we have
in our possession the black box,

04:56.212 --> 05:00.341
but last night on said black box,
I heard Capt. Daly crying for help.

05:00.425 --> 05:03.261
-You have the black box from 828?
-I do. I can play it for you.

05:04.178 --> 05:05.888
Uh, I believe you.

05:07.974 --> 05:11.686
Hello? Earth to Ben. This is…
this is important. Give it a listen.

05:11.769 --> 05:12.854
Eden's important.

05:14.188 --> 05:17.483
Of course, but the black box came to us
because of a Calling.

05:17.567 --> 05:19.360
Who knows what that's gonna answer for us.

05:21.487 --> 05:25.366
Our Death Date is in 18 months.
We have to follow every lead.

05:25.450 --> 05:28.745
Knock yourselves out.
I don't follow Callings anymore.

05:29.245 --> 05:32.457
All I have to show for it is
a murdered wife and a kidnapped daughter.

05:33.791 --> 05:35.626
The Callings took everything from me.

05:39.672 --> 05:40.965
I don't know what to say.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.634
I'm sorry I bothered you.

06:07.533 --> 06:09.452
Not gonna say I told you so.

06:10.161 --> 06:13.039
Okay. I'm sorry, Cal,
but this is on us now.

06:13.122 --> 06:16.000
After what Angelina did,
our Lifeboat is going to sink.

06:16.084 --> 06:19.045
We need another way,
or we are dead too. All of us.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.636
And while he rocked her, he sang.

06:38.815 --> 06:41.984
There you go. No more tangles, right?

06:42.485 --> 06:44.570
Now the bad man won't recognize us.

06:45.154 --> 06:46.197
We'll be okay.

07:09.220 --> 07:10.221
Sorry.

07:35.788 --> 07:38.124
<i>In the past four weeks,</i>
<i>have you had any encounters</i>

07:38.207 --> 07:40.626
<i>with other passengers of Flight 828?</i>

07:41.127 --> 07:43.629
<i>Ben Stone. Saanvi Bahl.</i>
<i>Just like every other check-in.</i>

07:43.713 --> 07:46.299
In the past week,
have you engaged in any illegal activity

07:46.382 --> 07:49.302
such as human trafficking,
money laundering, terrorism?

07:49.385 --> 07:50.219
No, I haven't.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.472
In the past week,
have you encountered any--

07:52.555 --> 07:54.932
Sorry to interrupt.
Take five, Morales.

07:55.016 --> 07:58.436
We have questions we need to ask Ms. Stone
that aren't on your list there.

07:58.978 --> 08:01.355
I'll take it from here
if you don't mind, Lieutenant.

08:01.439 --> 08:04.150
A passenger who entered the country
illegally is wanted for extradition

08:04.233 --> 08:06.068
for a number of crimes
in Singapore and China.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.198
I'm not hearing a question. Sorry.

08:10.281 --> 08:12.700
Were you at the Port of New York
yesterday morning?

08:13.284 --> 08:14.202
No, I wasn't.

08:14.285 --> 08:15.828
Do you have an alibi for where you were?

08:15.912 --> 08:19.123
Someone who matches your height
and hair color was seen at the port.

08:19.207 --> 08:22.960
So, you wanna try again?
What were you up to yesterday morning?

08:23.044 --> 08:24.253
Yesterday?

08:24.879 --> 08:27.507
Yeah, uh, that was the morning

08:27.590 --> 08:30.843
that the death certificate for my niece
was dropped off.

08:30.927 --> 08:32.887
One of your colleagues
closed down the case,

08:32.970 --> 08:36.641
so I actually spent the morning
comforting a widowed, devastated father

08:36.724 --> 08:40.520
while his only remaining child
was upstairs in her room crying.

08:40.603 --> 08:42.480
Uh, what did you guys do?

08:45.149 --> 08:46.526
She was your partner.

08:47.109 --> 08:48.277
You buying this?

08:49.737 --> 08:50.613
I am.

08:53.449 --> 08:57.578
Great. I'd love to assist you further,
but I actually don't have any information,

08:57.662 --> 08:59.580
nor was I involved,
so if there's nothing else,

08:59.664 --> 09:02.500
then I'd love to get back to my brother.

09:04.001 --> 09:06.170
If you remember anything,
you know where to find us.

09:23.646 --> 09:26.899
Dad, you know Saanvi's
just trying to help.

09:26.983 --> 09:29.110
We've been looking for the plane
for two years,

09:29.193 --> 09:31.529
and now a piece of it's
found its way to us.

09:32.530 --> 09:35.449
And, Dad, it was my Calling
that led us to the black box.

09:37.034 --> 09:38.119
You had a Calling?

09:38.202 --> 09:41.706
I don't know why I'm being trusted again.

09:41.789 --> 09:45.376
You get one Calling, and it leads you
to exactly what you've been looking for.

09:46.669 --> 09:50.881
Dad, you've done everything
you possibly could.

09:54.927 --> 09:56.137
Not everything.

09:57.513 --> 09:59.265
I could go on Aaron Glover's show.

10:00.099 --> 10:03.477
Aaron Glover? What, the podcast guy?
Wait. Why would you do that?

10:03.561 --> 10:05.479
He left messages begging for an interview.

10:05.563 --> 10:07.231
He wants to hear what I have to say.

10:07.315 --> 10:09.358
To help remind the world
that Eden's missing.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.819
This guy does not wanna help you.

10:11.902 --> 10:14.405
He just wants listeners. Period.

10:14.947 --> 10:16.907
Remember what you always told us?

10:17.533 --> 10:19.243
Overexposure could hurt 828ers.

10:19.327 --> 10:21.037
Yeah, we're already hurting.

10:38.387 --> 10:41.515
Go to Grandpa Steve's for a few hours.
You shouldn't be here when they get here.

10:42.808 --> 10:45.061
-Dad--
-I need to do this.

10:51.442 --> 10:52.485
Take a jacket!

10:57.281 --> 11:00.201
Hey, I was telling Henry
I'm securing a safe house for him.

11:00.284 --> 11:02.119
-In the Hamptons.
-Yeah, right.

11:02.203 --> 11:04.622
It'll take another day or two
to work out all the details.

11:04.705 --> 11:07.750
Until then, it is crucial
no one knows his whereabouts.

11:07.833 --> 11:11.504
It's extraordinary what you've done.
Escaping. Finding your way here.

11:11.587 --> 11:14.256
When I was young,
I was struck by lightning.

11:14.965 --> 11:17.802
It gave me this strange-looking scar.

11:17.885 --> 11:19.345
My father told me

11:20.221 --> 11:21.764
the scar's a dragon.

11:21.847 --> 11:23.557
Yeah. Yeah, I can see that.

11:23.641 --> 11:26.477
He said this dragon lives inside me,

11:26.560 --> 11:30.564
making me strong
and capable of doing anything.

11:31.065 --> 11:33.484
Four weeks at sea. It's a miracle.

11:33.567 --> 11:36.654
Not to mention two years as a lab rat.

11:36.737 --> 11:38.698
But I would channel my inner dragon,

11:39.490 --> 11:40.866
breathing through it

11:41.492 --> 11:46.872
until I could lower my heartbeat enough
to feel vibrations from the box.

11:46.956 --> 11:48.416
What do you mean, vibrations?

11:48.499 --> 11:53.129
A humming, as if the box
was meditating along with me.

11:53.212 --> 11:55.506
-That is when it happened.

11:55.589 --> 11:56.882
What happened?

11:56.966 --> 12:01.887
I began to hear
an ocean of voices buried beneath the hum.

12:01.971 --> 12:03.764
Like, multiple voices? What did they say?

12:03.848 --> 12:05.641
I can never make them out.

12:05.725 --> 12:08.477
They're on top of each other all at once.

12:08.561 --> 12:11.355
I didn't hear anything like that.
Other than Daly calling for help.

12:11.439 --> 12:15.025
That comes right at the end.
I'll show you. Can you play?

12:25.453 --> 12:26.704
Close your eyes.

12:27.204 --> 12:28.122
Breathe.

12:28.205 --> 12:29.707
<i>Are you sure about this?</i>

12:31.041 --> 12:32.835
<i>Maintaining level altitude.</i>

12:32.918 --> 12:34.086
<i>Here we go.</i>

12:37.673 --> 12:40.843
There. The humming. Listen.

12:43.888 --> 12:46.390
Voices on top of voices.

12:51.145 --> 12:52.521
<i>Help me!</i>

13:22.843 --> 13:25.930
-Hey. So, I have a few more.

13:27.264 --> 13:28.224
Thank you.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.187
Mick, I'm so sorry.

13:46.492 --> 13:48.911
Do you need me
to pick anything up for the reception?

13:48.994 --> 13:51.163
I don't think
you should come to the reception.

13:52.998 --> 13:55.709
-If this has something to do with what I--
-It does.

13:58.754 --> 14:00.339
What you said about Zeke.

14:02.007 --> 14:03.384
My husband.

14:04.218 --> 14:06.554
It's not okay
that you're in my life anymore.

14:13.477 --> 14:14.520
Say something.

14:15.187 --> 14:17.439
You want me to say it's gonna be okay.

14:19.608 --> 14:20.776
Hey, I get it.

14:22.403 --> 14:23.946
I gambled, and I lost.

14:27.658 --> 14:29.368
And I'd do it all over again.

14:46.343 --> 14:48.721
Are you seriously checking
for bugs right now?

14:48.804 --> 14:50.973
With the Registry, I, you know, just--

14:51.056 --> 14:54.184
Damn, Stone.
You really think I'd do that to you?

14:58.898 --> 15:00.691
You had to pick this park, huh?

15:00.774 --> 15:01.692
It's out of the way.

15:02.192 --> 15:06.155
I don't need to remind you how risky it is
for a badge to be seen with a passenger.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.073
That's why I had Drea send you.

15:09.366 --> 15:11.327
-This about me at the docks?
-Sort of.

15:11.410 --> 15:13.412
China knows Henry's on US soil.

15:14.246 --> 15:16.749
NYPD's tasked with bringing him in.
There's a team standing by.

15:16.832 --> 15:18.292
What are they waiting for?

15:18.375 --> 15:21.503
A location.
We're cooperating with the Chinese.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.797
They're getting his coordinates.
I just don't know how.

15:24.298 --> 15:26.508
Either they're tracking his phone
or a watch.

15:27.009 --> 15:28.469
Or they're tracking him.

15:28.552 --> 15:32.306
If you're stashing this guy somewhere,
you need to get him out fast.

15:39.980 --> 15:42.232
You know, your M's held up better
than my J.

15:42.733 --> 15:44.860
Well, you have terrible handwriting, so…

15:45.819 --> 15:48.656
Remember how I used to have to read you
the cards I'd sent you out loud?

15:48.739 --> 15:50.157
You couldn't make out my writing.

15:52.117 --> 15:53.118
I could read it.

15:58.207 --> 16:00.751
All right, you're running out of time. Go.

16:00.834 --> 16:01.919
Thank you.

16:06.006 --> 16:09.802
I still don't hear anything.
No voices. Not even a hum.

16:09.885 --> 16:13.722
I keep trying to enhance the frequency.
Let me try this.

16:17.559 --> 16:18.936
What's that?

16:19.770 --> 16:20.896
I still don't hear it.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.399
No, I saw something. Over there.

16:23.482 --> 16:26.360
That's one of the machines
we had Dr. Cooper install, right?

16:26.443 --> 16:28.696
Yeah, it's tracking seismic activity.

16:29.655 --> 16:31.240
That's the first time it's gone off…

16:33.367 --> 16:35.452
Stop the recording.
We shouldn't be doing this.

16:35.536 --> 16:38.998
We might be causing real-world damage
again with our experimentation.

16:39.081 --> 16:41.083
Okay, let's get Dr. Cooper in.

16:41.166 --> 16:44.128
Hey, guys. I think the NYPD
might be tracking Henry.

16:44.211 --> 16:46.046
-Why do you think that?
-I have a source.

16:46.130 --> 16:49.299
Do you have a phone on you, Henry?
A watch, jewelry, anything?

16:49.383 --> 16:53.429
I was afraid of that. Is there any chance
they've implanted a chip under your skin?

16:53.512 --> 16:56.098
There were so many tests,
and sometimes I was sedated.

16:56.181 --> 16:58.517
-It is possible.
-Okay, we've gotta get him out of here.

16:58.600 --> 16:59.435
I know a place.

16:59.518 --> 17:02.146
Take the ghost car and Henry.
I'll quarterback from here. Go.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.823
In the past four weeks,
have you experienced

17:12.906 --> 17:15.784
any unexplained visions
or voices in your head?

17:15.868 --> 17:18.620
This time and every time, no.

17:18.704 --> 17:22.791
In the past four weeks,
have you experienced, heard, heard about,

17:22.875 --> 17:26.879
or otherwise become aware of any event
defying conventional explanation?

17:26.962 --> 17:29.048
I'll say the same thing I say every time.

17:29.131 --> 17:32.718
There is an explanation for all this.
You just don't accept my explanation.

17:32.801 --> 17:34.678
Right. The agents of the apocalypse.

17:34.762 --> 17:38.057
Mark it down. Also, mark down
that I refuse to be an agent of anything

17:38.140 --> 17:39.641
except helping my fellow man.

17:40.851 --> 17:43.645
My fingerprints haven't changed
since the last ten times you--

17:51.153 --> 17:54.031
Was that-- Did you just have a vision?

17:54.114 --> 17:55.365
Heard a voice?

17:55.449 --> 17:58.285
I was holding in a sneeze.
I'm fighting off a cold.

17:58.786 --> 18:01.371
You should've mentioned that.
It could affect your vitals.

18:15.010 --> 18:16.970
-Hey.
-Hey. How you doing?

18:17.054 --> 18:18.972
No, no, don't use that on me, Zeke.

18:20.349 --> 18:23.268
It's not a good time.
I gotta get the house ready.

18:23.352 --> 18:26.522
There's never a good time, but I think
it's something you need to hear.

18:27.022 --> 18:28.107
I'm asking for five minutes.

18:38.367 --> 18:39.785
I can feel your anger.

18:39.868 --> 18:41.787
Yeah, well, I'm angry, Zeke.

18:41.870 --> 18:42.871
Toward Cal.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.084
I'm not angry at Cal.

18:47.793 --> 18:49.378
Well, he certainly doesn't know that.

18:50.420 --> 18:53.006
For two years now, this darkness,

18:53.841 --> 18:56.009
it sucks the energy out of the room, Ben.

18:56.677 --> 19:00.722
And by the way, you don't have to be
an empath to feel it. Cal can feel it.

19:00.806 --> 19:03.976
There's no blame here.
I'm just trying to find my daughter.

19:04.059 --> 19:05.185
You know what?

19:05.853 --> 19:08.772
Instead of armchair psychoanalyzing
my family, why don't you--

19:11.900 --> 19:15.154
How about you stick around and use that
empath thing to help find my daughter?

19:17.322 --> 19:18.699
What… what's going on?

19:18.782 --> 19:21.243
I've got an interview, live.
They take calls.

19:21.326 --> 19:24.329
Maybe you'll pick up something.
A witness, an accessory…

19:24.830 --> 19:27.124
-Wait. The interview's happening here?
-Yeah.

19:27.207 --> 19:28.375
Okay.

19:29.293 --> 19:30.419
Can you do that for me?

19:31.253 --> 19:33.088
-I'll try.
-Great, thank you.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.048
I told Cal to stay away from the house,

19:35.132 --> 19:38.468
but we've gotta get rid of any trace
that he lives here.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.053
Divide and conquer?

20:05.162 --> 20:07.789
Excuse me.
I think you left this in the bathroom.

20:09.291 --> 20:10.167
Thank you.

20:12.002 --> 20:13.629
You two in any trouble? I…

20:14.338 --> 20:17.507
I found a hotline for a shelter…

20:17.591 --> 20:19.635
Oh, no. We're fine. Fine.

20:22.763 --> 20:25.974
Oh, so precious.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.560
Is this for me? Oh.

20:31.188 --> 20:34.733
I should probably get her down for a nap.
Time to go, love.

20:35.859 --> 20:36.693
Come on.

20:37.236 --> 20:40.072
Excuse me. Can I get some help here?

20:44.201 --> 20:46.161
Take your next left. They're honing in.

20:50.457 --> 20:51.833
You sure this is gonna work?

20:51.917 --> 20:54.503
The building I'm leading you to
stores magnets so strong,

20:54.586 --> 20:56.672
your credit cards will stop working
in the parking lot.

20:56.755 --> 21:00.384
Okay. I wish you told me that before
I got in the car with every credit card.

21:00.467 --> 21:03.178
Point is, Henry's microchip
doesn't stand a chance.

21:05.055 --> 21:07.849
You gotta get out. They're getting closer.
Gonna block you in.

21:07.933 --> 21:09.309
Yeah. On it.

21:20.988 --> 21:21.863
They're on my tail.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.825
-There.
-Hard right at the intersection.

21:35.836 --> 21:37.462
Guys, they've got air support.

21:37.546 --> 21:40.257
Keep going. We can lose 'em
under the overpass up ahead.

21:47.431 --> 21:50.559
Pick up speed.
Wheels on the ground are closing in.

22:00.819 --> 22:01.903
Hang on.

22:09.786 --> 22:12.706
-Why have you stopped?
-There's a garbage truck blocking me.

22:14.124 --> 22:15.292
I'm turning around.

22:15.375 --> 22:18.587
Hey! Henry, stop! What are you doing?
Get back in the car. We gotta go.

22:19.463 --> 22:22.424
-<i>Henry, get back in the car.</i>
-<i>I've done what I needed to.</i>

22:23.592 --> 22:26.303
-I gave Cal the black box, so go.
-No. No!

22:26.386 --> 22:27.929
No! Henry!

22:28.638 --> 22:30.265
You gotta get out of there now.

22:39.566 --> 22:41.943
Nice and easy. Nice and easy.

23:14.935 --> 23:17.479
I shouldn't have let him go.
I should have stayed with him.

23:17.562 --> 23:19.731
-You'd be in jail.
-There's nothing you could've done.

23:19.815 --> 23:21.858
What about you, Vance?
Is there anything you can do?

23:21.942 --> 23:22.943
I wish there was.

23:23.026 --> 23:25.779
Come on. You are the most hooked-up person
I know. Look at all this.

23:25.862 --> 23:29.574
I tapped into a slush fund
from an old op to get us up and running.

23:29.658 --> 23:31.535
And now no government involvement.

23:31.618 --> 23:34.663
And we should keep it that way
so we don't risk exposing all this.

23:34.746 --> 23:37.582
There has got to be
someone that you trust. Powell?

23:39.209 --> 23:42.838
I'll make a call, but it's gonna be tough
keeping Henry on US soil.

23:42.921 --> 23:46.091
He was used as a human lab rat
and nearly died trying to get to us.

23:46.174 --> 23:48.218
-The least we can do is try.

23:51.012 --> 23:52.806
-Hey.
-<i>Got an hour to spare?</i>

23:54.141 --> 23:55.559
Ben's going live with Aaron Glover.

23:56.852 --> 23:57.769
Is that a joke?

23:57.853 --> 23:59.104
I wish.

23:59.604 --> 24:01.982
Saanvi, can you find the Glover podcast?

24:02.983 --> 24:07.487
You know Ben. He thinks maybe the perp
will call in, and I'll pick up on it.

24:07.571 --> 24:10.907
I'm sitting here in the home
of passenger Benjamin Stone

24:10.991 --> 24:14.369
to talk about the 828er
who committed cold-blooded murder

24:14.453 --> 24:15.829
and got away with it.

24:15.912 --> 24:18.331
Ben's timing sucks.
Our family needs to lay low right now.

24:18.415 --> 24:19.708
The Henry Kim thing just blew up.

24:19.791 --> 24:22.752
<i>-They've got him in custody.</i>
Does the Registry know you were involved?

24:22.836 --> 24:25.464
No, but, uh, only 'cause
someone tipped us off in time.

24:25.547 --> 24:26.465
<i>Thank God.</i>

24:26.965 --> 24:27.841
Yeah.

24:29.092 --> 24:30.427
What aren't you telling me?

24:31.845 --> 24:33.805
You're not using your…

24:33.889 --> 24:35.432
I don't have to. What is it?

24:37.392 --> 24:39.019
It was Jared that tipped me off.

24:39.769 --> 24:41.521
Second Jared-save this week.

24:43.064 --> 24:45.442
-Are you okay with that?
-<i>I don't know. Are you?</i>

24:48.111 --> 24:49.905
We should talk about it later.

24:51.281 --> 24:54.201
-All right. I'll see you tonight.
-Yup.

25:19.059 --> 25:19.893
Um…

25:21.853 --> 25:24.064
You said we should talk, so, um…

25:25.732 --> 25:26.608
I'll start.

25:29.277 --> 25:30.111
Um…

25:33.949 --> 25:35.951
I still have feelings for Jared.

25:37.410 --> 25:39.788
And I hate that I do, but I do.

25:43.166 --> 25:44.125
Um…

25:45.168 --> 25:47.796
I'm sorry that you have to feel that
because that's not…

25:50.006 --> 25:51.591
that's not fair to you.

25:53.385 --> 25:54.970
Frankly, it's not fair to me either

25:55.053 --> 25:57.180
'cause there are things
that are meant to be private,

25:57.264 --> 26:00.016
and that's just not the case
in our relationship.

26:00.100 --> 26:02.394
-It's not like I try to read your mind.
-I know. I know.

26:08.024 --> 26:08.984
Zeke.

26:10.860 --> 26:12.237
The feelings will fade.

26:13.780 --> 26:15.240
It's been a long time.

26:17.450 --> 26:21.454
I don't know, Mick. Maybe you and Jared
were supposed to be together.

26:21.538 --> 26:23.582
-No.
-If I never came out of the cave.

26:23.665 --> 26:25.083
If we never met.

26:25.166 --> 26:26.501
I chose you.

26:27.919 --> 26:31.756
I will continue to choose you
every single day,

26:31.840 --> 26:35.302
no matter if you have
one day left or 10,000.

26:37.596 --> 26:38.888
I love you.

26:40.015 --> 26:42.017
You have to feel that too, no?

26:44.769 --> 26:46.313
I love you so much.

26:47.856 --> 26:48.940
Give us time.

26:52.694 --> 26:54.904
Give us the chance to get back to that.

26:57.866 --> 26:59.784
Just you and me under the stars.

27:14.466 --> 27:17.135
-Hey, where's Henry?
-He's not here. What's going on?

27:17.218 --> 27:19.304
-Well, I need to see him.
-You can't. He's in custody.

27:19.387 --> 27:21.973
What? No. I just had another Calling.
They're actually back.

27:22.057 --> 27:23.350
And Henry was there too.

27:23.433 --> 27:26.519
He was trying to give me something,
but his hands were empty.

27:26.603 --> 27:28.271
He already gave you the black box.

27:28.355 --> 27:31.316
There has to be something else.
I need to talk to him.

27:31.399 --> 27:35.195
God! I finally get the Callings back,
and the one person who can help me…

27:35.278 --> 27:36.529
I have to solve this with him.

27:36.613 --> 27:38.948
Okay, I'm gonna get Vance,
see if he's tracked him down.

27:39.032 --> 27:40.283
Just stay put.

27:40.367 --> 27:44.913
<i>…to find police</i>
<i>surrounding the house and your wife…</i>

27:45.497 --> 27:46.956
-Is that…
<i>-…brutally murdered.</i>

27:47.707 --> 27:52.003
<i>Her alleged killer, Angelina Meyer,</i>
<i>uses a hide-a-key to gain entry</i>

27:52.087 --> 27:53.672
and kidnaps your daughter

27:54.506 --> 27:56.007
and commits murder-suicide.

27:56.091 --> 28:00.428
Angelina Meyer is not only
a murderer and a kidnapper<i>,</i>

28:01.554 --> 28:02.931
but a continued threat.

28:04.057 --> 28:06.643
She is alive.

28:07.560 --> 28:10.438
<i>No body. No eyewitnesses from the bridge.</i>

28:10.522 --> 28:11.564
<i>She's out there.</i>

28:12.482 --> 28:16.569
And if your listeners
would just simply look for her,

28:16.653 --> 28:17.612
we can find her.

28:17.696 --> 28:20.365
And if we find her,
we find my daughter, so please…

28:24.119 --> 28:25.620
Please help me find Angelina.

28:26.705 --> 28:29.249
She's five-foot-two, dark brown eyes--

28:29.332 --> 28:33.712
My brother must have run out for a sec,
but we are so glad that you called.

28:38.758 --> 28:41.511
It's really nice of you to let us stay.

28:43.680 --> 28:46.433
I'll pay you back somehow.
Maybe I could do some cleaning…

28:46.516 --> 28:47.767
Don't be silly, Violet.

28:47.851 --> 28:50.562
We are honored to house an 828er
in a time of need.

28:51.396 --> 28:54.816
So make yourselves at home,
and I'll go get the bed made up for you.

29:10.582 --> 29:13.710
<i>All right, we're on with Steven</i>
<i>calling in with a tip.</i>

29:14.335 --> 29:15.211
Hi, Steven.

29:15.295 --> 29:18.965
<i>Um, yeah,</i>
<i>so I have a tip about Angelina.</i>

29:19.674 --> 29:22.260
<i>You know, I know exactly where she is.</i>

29:23.052 --> 29:24.471
<i>Feeding the fish.</i>

29:24.554 --> 29:29.100
<i>Look, no one survives a jump off a bridge</i>
<i>as high as the one by the Narrows.</i>

29:29.184 --> 29:32.103
<i>-Come on. There's just no way…</i>
Look, this isn't a joke.

29:32.187 --> 29:35.523
No matter what you think of 828 or of me,
a little girl's life is at stake.

29:36.107 --> 29:38.902
She's three years old. She's all alone.
She's done nothing wrong.

29:39.527 --> 29:41.905
So the next question is from me.

29:42.489 --> 29:44.240
What about your other missing child?

29:45.700 --> 29:46.743
What?

29:46.826 --> 29:49.662
<i>You didn't just lose</i>
<i>your daughter that night.</i>

29:49.746 --> 29:51.122
<i>You lost your son too.</i>

29:52.332 --> 29:53.458
Uh…

29:53.541 --> 29:55.210
I'm here to focus on Eden.

29:56.336 --> 29:57.754
There were whispers

29:57.837 --> 30:01.424
that some government officials
would refer to Cal as the Holy Grail.

30:03.009 --> 30:05.762
Do you fear your own son?
Is that why you aren't looking for him?

30:06.805 --> 30:09.682
<i>Cal ran away. He made a choice.</i>

30:10.433 --> 30:13.102
But Eden, she didn't choose any of this.

30:13.186 --> 30:14.896
She's an innocent victim here.

30:21.653 --> 30:23.154
What? Turn it back on. I'm okay.

30:23.238 --> 30:26.449
We've heard enough. Cal, your dad,
he is trying to protect you.

30:26.533 --> 30:29.244
-He doesn't mean any of that.
-Well, it's not like I don't deserve it.

30:29.327 --> 30:31.412
-Cal, no one blames you.
-You sure about that?

30:32.288 --> 30:36.084
My own dad won't even
look me in the eye. And I get it.

30:36.167 --> 30:39.254
Because everybody else knew
Angelina was dangerous. But I--

30:39.337 --> 30:41.172
You were listening to a Calling.

30:41.256 --> 30:43.174
We're doing our best with the Callings.

30:43.258 --> 30:46.761
They're the only hope we have.
You'll get your groove back. Give it time.

30:48.388 --> 30:49.347
Good news.

30:49.931 --> 30:52.600
I got a 20
on where they've got Henry locked up.

30:52.684 --> 30:56.145
Bad news, breaking him out
is gonna be impossible.

30:59.023 --> 31:00.441
What if we break Cal in?

31:04.821 --> 31:05.947
Here you go.

31:07.323 --> 31:09.409
I think you two should be
comfortable in here.

31:13.246 --> 31:17.083
Would it be okay if we just kept it
between us that I'm here?

31:17.750 --> 31:18.668
And why is that?

31:19.711 --> 31:23.298
A lot of people hate us passengers.
They don't think we're human.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.300
What would you say you are?

31:27.510 --> 31:28.469
I…

31:29.429 --> 31:30.430
I don't know.

31:31.014 --> 31:33.308
Well, between us,
it might be good to find out.

31:34.809 --> 31:36.227
You two stay right here.

32:00.126 --> 32:02.295
I don't get it.
You can vibe what Mick wants for a snack,

32:02.378 --> 32:03.630
but on this, you got nothing.

32:04.130 --> 32:06.633
Why is everyone assuming
I can empath through the phone?

32:06.716 --> 32:10.011
Just like you can't control when
you get a Calling, I'm still learning.

32:15.141 --> 32:16.017
I'm sorry.

32:16.517 --> 32:19.896
I know how much you wanted this,
and I'm not asking you--

32:19.979 --> 32:22.231
I'm not in the mood
for another lecture, Zeke.

32:26.402 --> 32:29.155
I'm asking you to make room in your heart
for the rest of your family.

32:29.238 --> 32:31.616
It won't mean you love Eden any less.

32:31.699 --> 32:33.993
You can love more than one person
at the same time.

32:35.870 --> 32:36.871
I would know.

32:44.712 --> 32:45.838
No, no, no.

32:46.631 --> 32:47.632
Don't do that.

32:48.758 --> 32:50.718
I don't need help bearing the pain, Zeke.

32:50.802 --> 32:52.136
-It's mine.

32:55.932 --> 32:58.226
<i>Great show, man.</i>
<i>Calls are still pouring in.</i>

32:58.309 --> 33:01.688
<i>Hey, I'm back at my studio.</i>
<i>Started sifting through the messages.</i>

33:01.771 --> 33:05.358
<i>And some lady said she saw someone</i>
<i>who might match the description.</i>

33:05.441 --> 33:06.818
<i>I figured I'd let you know.</i>

33:08.444 --> 33:09.737
I'm coming with you.

33:11.572 --> 33:13.157
Just remember you were never here.

33:13.241 --> 33:14.283
I know the drill.

33:14.367 --> 33:17.787
Same thing as when I didn't install
that seismology equipment for you.

33:18.287 --> 33:19.163
Here, look at this.

33:19.247 --> 33:23.042
-That's something, right?
-It's definitely something.

33:23.126 --> 33:26.963
Those tremors appear every time
I play the cockpit voice recorder.

33:27.755 --> 33:29.007
But it's odd.

33:29.090 --> 33:31.968
They played it a zillion times at Eureka
and nothing.

33:32.051 --> 33:34.345
Well, the recording's changed.

33:35.221 --> 33:37.807
The black box recording? Changed?

33:38.349 --> 33:39.559
That's not possible.

33:40.852 --> 33:41.894
And yet…

33:48.151 --> 33:49.944
<i>Help me!</i>

33:50.528 --> 33:51.529
Fascinating.

33:51.612 --> 33:55.158
-So the reading spikes every 6.2 seconds.
-6.2 seconds.

33:55.241 --> 33:59.078
So, what? Every time I play the recording,
I'm triggering a 6.2-second earthquake?

33:59.162 --> 34:00.913
You're not triggering any earthquake.

34:00.997 --> 34:03.833
If you were, all these other machines
would be registering it.

34:03.916 --> 34:04.834
But this one's spiking.

34:04.917 --> 34:07.503
That's because this machine
doesn't detect actual tremors

34:07.587 --> 34:11.632
but emissions called
ultra low frequency. ULF.

34:11.716 --> 34:14.510
Frequency as in sound waves?

34:14.594 --> 34:15.762
Uh, sort of.

34:15.845 --> 34:19.015
Um, electromagnetic waves
that can't be heard by the human ear.

34:19.098 --> 34:22.185
The reason that it's relevant to me,
and therefore you,

34:22.268 --> 34:25.104
is that ULF is emitted by earthquakes.

34:25.188 --> 34:29.567
But earthquakes aren't causing
the frequency spike. So, what is?

34:37.033 --> 34:39.535
-I wish I could go in with you, but--
-You can't.

34:39.619 --> 34:42.789
It was my Calling anyway, which sucks
'cause I have no idea what I'm doing.

34:42.872 --> 34:44.916
Yes, you do. You got this, okay?

34:45.416 --> 34:47.418
When you get past that front desk…

34:47.502 --> 34:49.420
Right, left, second door on the right.

34:49.504 --> 34:51.422
-On the left.
-Yeah.

34:51.506 --> 34:52.757
Henry will be inside.

34:52.840 --> 34:54.926
Once you are in there,
you have two minutes tops.

34:55.009 --> 34:57.220
-So find out what he knows and get out.
-Okay.

34:57.303 --> 34:59.013
They won't know who you are
unless you leave a fingerprint.

34:59.097 --> 35:01.349
They took them when we got off the plane
in 2018. Remember?

35:01.432 --> 35:03.226
Yeah, so don't touch anything.

35:03.726 --> 35:06.145
God, I feel like
I'm walking into the Death Star.

35:06.229 --> 35:07.855
That's kinda 'cause you are.

35:09.982 --> 35:11.692
It's gonna… it's gonna work. Trust me.

35:27.208 --> 35:28.960
This is the address he gave me.

35:36.467 --> 35:38.845
That explains why
no one answered the phone.

35:38.928 --> 35:40.847
-We'll come back.
-I can't let this lead get cold.

35:40.930 --> 35:42.640
If Angelina and Eden passed…

35:44.183 --> 35:45.518
passed by here…

35:47.436 --> 35:48.396
I was just here.

35:52.150 --> 35:53.234
<i>It's Anna's house.</i>

35:54.110 --> 35:56.237
I'm pretty sure she has a security camera.
Come on.

36:02.493 --> 36:03.661
Thanks, Anna.

36:04.453 --> 36:06.038
It's about my daughter.

36:06.122 --> 36:08.708
Someone at the laundromat
down the block thought they saw Angelina.

36:08.791 --> 36:11.043
Oh my God. Someone saw her?

36:11.127 --> 36:13.254
She was walking
with a little girl Eden's age.

36:13.337 --> 36:14.338
Oh. Wow!

36:14.422 --> 36:16.382
And I remembered your security cameras.

36:16.465 --> 36:18.801
Can we take a look?
They might have walked by.

36:19.552 --> 36:21.971
Oh, well, the camera's not real.

36:22.471 --> 36:24.932
I just put it up to stop the vandalism.

36:26.809 --> 36:30.313
I'm sorry. I… I wish I could help.

36:31.564 --> 36:32.565
You're lying.

36:37.028 --> 36:38.154
Anna, what's going on?

36:39.864 --> 36:41.032
Why are you so nervous?

36:41.991 --> 36:45.536
You're covering, but inside,
you're afraid you're gonna get caught.

36:45.620 --> 36:46.579
No.

36:48.998 --> 36:50.124
I was helping you.

36:50.750 --> 36:52.543
We saved someone.

36:54.754 --> 36:55.922
She feels regret.

36:56.505 --> 36:57.423
I'm sorry.

37:00.509 --> 37:02.803
-I don't wanna get in trouble.
-What did you do?

37:02.887 --> 37:06.307
I'm so sorry. I couldn't sleep last night.
I was tossing and turning.

37:06.390 --> 37:08.643
I was wondering whether I should call you.

37:10.686 --> 37:13.689
I was manipulated by her. I swear it.

37:13.773 --> 37:14.607
Angelina?

37:18.152 --> 37:20.196
You talked to her? She's alive?

37:24.367 --> 37:25.201
Eden?

37:26.869 --> 37:31.332
Angelina told me
that she saved Eden from you!

37:31.916 --> 37:35.628
She just told me awful things
about you and your wife,

37:35.711 --> 37:39.924
and I was thinking about my nephews
and what I would do to protect them.

37:40.007 --> 37:43.219
And it wasn't until I got
to know you yesterday that I realized--

37:43.302 --> 37:44.262
Eden's alive.

37:49.225 --> 37:50.268
Where is she?

37:51.852 --> 37:52.937
-Where is she?!
-Ben!

37:53.020 --> 37:53.896
-Please!
-Ben!

37:53.980 --> 37:54.855
Where is she?!

37:55.356 --> 37:56.399
Ben…

38:37.648 --> 38:39.358
I just figured I'd report it.

38:39.442 --> 38:42.820
Might be nothing, but it's about an 828er,
so you never know.

38:42.903 --> 38:45.573
Cubicle five.
You can file your incident report there.

38:45.656 --> 38:48.451
Next. Hey, ma'am, how can I help you?
What's your name?

38:48.534 --> 38:49.910
Hi, I'm Jeanine.

39:01.422 --> 39:02.381
Okay.

39:04.342 --> 39:06.135
It's okay. Stay here for Mommy.

39:13.100 --> 39:14.352
Adrian?

39:15.519 --> 39:17.313
-You.
-Help me.

39:31.077 --> 39:32.244
We gotta go. Quick.

39:38.709 --> 39:39.752
Your other left.

39:40.586 --> 39:41.712
I knew that.

39:48.636 --> 39:51.013
Hey, did Intake tell you
about that extra test?

39:51.097 --> 39:51.931
What test?

39:52.515 --> 39:55.601
I'm not sure. You'd better go ask 'em.

39:56.143 --> 39:57.144
I'll keep an eye.

39:59.438 --> 40:00.356
Typical.

40:06.695 --> 40:07.613
Two minutes.

40:07.696 --> 40:09.031
Henry. Thank God.

40:09.573 --> 40:12.034
I hoped I'd get to say goodbye to you.

40:12.118 --> 40:13.953
I'm so sorry
we didn't get you out in time.

40:14.036 --> 40:17.081
But Vance is in touch with his contact
at the UN Human Rights Watch.

40:17.164 --> 40:21.585
-They'll make sure you're okay.
-I am okay. My journey is complete.

40:21.669 --> 40:25.005
How can you say that
after we shared such an awful Calling?

40:25.089 --> 40:27.925
You had your hand out
like you were trying to,

40:28.008 --> 40:29.552
I don't know, give me something?

40:30.136 --> 40:32.012
You have everything you need.

40:32.096 --> 40:34.181
No, I don't. I need help.

40:34.890 --> 40:38.060
For two years,
I've had Callings to find you.

40:38.144 --> 40:40.813
I knew I had to reach you no matter what

40:40.896 --> 40:42.982
to give you what you need.

40:43.691 --> 40:45.192
I have faith in you.

40:45.818 --> 40:49.613
You are strong, capable of anything.

40:50.990 --> 40:52.908
You just need to believe it.

40:56.287 --> 40:58.873
I wear my scar on the outside.

40:59.415 --> 41:02.334
Yours is on the inside.

41:03.210 --> 41:04.962
You're a dragon, Cal.

41:05.629 --> 41:06.881
Just like me.

41:07.381 --> 41:09.967
-You need to bolt, now.

41:10.843 --> 41:12.344
I still don't understand.

41:12.845 --> 41:13.846
You will.

41:20.394 --> 41:22.771
After I saw
what kind of person you really are,

41:22.855 --> 41:25.983
I told her I couldn't do this anymore.

41:26.817 --> 41:29.778
Last night,
she took what she could and left.

41:30.905 --> 41:33.991
-Where are they now?
-I don't know. Truly, I'm sorry.

42:31.590 --> 42:34.385
-Why are we stopping?
-We have to talk.

42:39.557 --> 42:41.559
Mommy's gonna talk to her friend, okay?

42:41.642 --> 42:43.102
-Be right back.
-Okay.

42:52.403 --> 42:54.196
How could you do what you did?

42:56.073 --> 42:58.951
You told me to get my guardian angel.

42:59.034 --> 43:02.288
I didn't tell you to kidnap a child.
I didn't tell you to kill someone!

43:02.371 --> 43:06.542
Grace wouldn't let her go.
And you were right. I needed Eden.

43:07.209 --> 43:11.255
She's kept me safe, and she did it again.
She Called you to save us.

43:11.338 --> 43:13.799
What am I supposed to do with you?
I have a new life.

43:13.882 --> 43:15.926
My hands are full,
helping shepherd 828ers.

43:16.010 --> 43:17.011
Then help me.

43:18.846 --> 43:19.763
Please, Adrian.

43:22.141 --> 43:24.393
Mommy, my tummy! I'm hungry!

43:29.690 --> 43:31.734
Let's go. Just for tonight.

43:39.617 --> 43:40.451
<i>Hello?</i>

43:40.534 --> 43:43.120
Hey, um, I just wanted to say thanks
for dropping Cal off.

43:43.829 --> 43:46.123
No prob. It would've been
too risky to leave together.

43:46.206 --> 43:47.750
<i>Well, I owe you, again.</i>

43:47.833 --> 43:50.169
-Anything, anytime, anywhere.

43:50.252 --> 43:52.546
<i>I know. Just wanted to say thanks.</i>

43:52.630 --> 43:53.839
You never have to.

43:56.008 --> 43:56.884
Who was that?

43:57.509 --> 43:59.219
I thought you weren't a detective anymore.

43:59.720 --> 44:00.596
Oh.

44:00.679 --> 44:03.307
-Are you pulling rank on me now?
-No, never.

44:03.390 --> 44:06.560
But I don't gotta tell you shit.
No strings, remember?

44:06.644 --> 44:07.561
No strings.

44:07.645 --> 44:09.021
-Zero.
-Nada.

44:27.331 --> 44:28.707
Hey, um…

44:29.833 --> 44:32.419
-I thought I'd take the long way home.
-I knew you would.

44:32.503 --> 44:33.420
And I'm glad

44:33.921 --> 44:35.422
because I wanted to do this.

44:44.765 --> 44:49.436
I had this whole speech planned,
and now I'm, uh, speechless.

44:49.520 --> 44:51.355
I have enough to say for the both of us.

44:51.855 --> 44:55.609
Starting with, I know
we're not exactly living the dream

44:55.693 --> 44:58.445
with the picket fence
and the two kids and the minivan--

44:58.529 --> 44:59.863
Minivan. Ooh.

44:59.947 --> 45:02.199
Minivan is not in my dream scenario.

45:03.283 --> 45:05.119
And you know I don't want kids.

45:06.662 --> 45:09.707
Is that what you want?
Do you want the picket fence? The--

45:09.790 --> 45:13.419
I have everything I want.
I don't wanna change anything.

45:15.754 --> 45:17.464
And with Jared…

45:18.757 --> 45:20.426
Look, you have a huge heart.

45:21.343 --> 45:25.139
There's room enough in there for everyone
who's lucky enough to be loved by you.

45:27.015 --> 45:28.809
I choose you, Michaela Stone,

45:29.393 --> 45:30.811
just as you are,

45:32.146 --> 45:34.648
right here, back under the stars.

46:54.895 --> 46:56.730
<i>Maintaining level altitude.</i>

46:56.814 --> 46:58.023
<i>Here we go.</i>

47:01.652 --> 47:02.986
<i>Maintaining level altitude.</i>

47:03.070 --> 47:04.488
<i>Here we go.</i>

47:07.783 --> 47:09.868
<i>Maintaining level altitude.</i>

47:09.952 --> 47:10.994
<i>Here we go.</i>

47:23.507 --> 47:25.092
<i>Don't worry, angel!</i>

47:29.680 --> 47:31.056
<i> If I'm supposed to…</i>

47:31.765 --> 47:32.599
<i>Slower.</i>

47:34.017 --> 47:35.060
<i>Slower.</i>

47:35.143 --> 47:37.062
<i>Go back. Save her.</i>

47:37.145 --> 47:38.647
-<i>Save him.</i>
-<i>Last chance.</i>

47:38.730 --> 47:39.565
<i>Own my truth.</i>

47:39.648 --> 47:41.024
-<i>Last chance.</i>
-<i>Set them free.</i>

47:41.108 --> 47:42.943
-<i>It's all connected.</i>
<i>It's all connected.</i>
