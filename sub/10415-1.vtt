00:50.318 --> 00:53.420
These are not the best of times.
And nothing comes easy anymore.

00:53.420 --> 00:56.990
In fact, ever since the fall of man,
things have been tough everywhere,

00:56.990 --> 00:59.691
especially in the San Joaquin valley.

00:59.691 --> 01:04.096
In 1910, in the southwest corner
of Kern County,

01:04.096 --> 01:07.497
god spoke in a gusher of black gold.

01:07.497 --> 01:09.166
We had a chance for greatness,

01:09.166 --> 01:11.759
And in 1911,
we changed our name.

01:14.637 --> 01:18.539
That was also the first year
Taft Midway Union High School

01:18.539 --> 01:20.640
played Bakersfield High in football.

01:20.640 --> 01:22.575
We lost...

01:22.575 --> 01:24.776
56 to 0.

01:24.776 --> 01:27.945
We also lost 25,000 barrels
of oil a day

01:27.945 --> 01:30.380
because nobody could figure out
how to cap the well.

01:30.380 --> 01:32.382
But we got on the map.

01:32.382 --> 01:34.751
You got to make trade-offs.
For instance...

01:34.751 --> 01:37.451
We've got the worst god damn
weather in the world,

01:37.451 --> 01:41.189
but it builds character.
That's a trade-off.

01:41.189 --> 01:44.691
And in 1913, we had a chance
to test that character.

01:44.691 --> 01:47.192
Taft's own Kid Lester,

01:47.192 --> 01:49.694
the toughest bastard ever
to come out of the oil fields,

01:49.694 --> 01:51.696
got to fight Sam Langford,

01:51.696 --> 01:54.391
the number one heavyweight
contender in the world.

01:57.333 --> 01:59.367
Rumor had it that
Langford was out of shape

01:59.367 --> 02:01.303
and didn't take the fight seriously.

02:01.303 --> 02:03.939
They say he didn't have
a right hand anymore.

02:03.939 --> 02:06.906
Kid Lester predicted a
knockout in the fifth round,

02:06.906 --> 02:09.809
and, unfortunately,
he got it.

02:09.809 --> 02:13.579
The Kid slipped quietly out of town
and was never seen again,

02:13.579 --> 02:17.240
though he vowed he would
someday return to redeem himself.

02:18.415 --> 02:21.417
Bakersfield beat us
by four touchdowns that year.

02:21.417 --> 02:24.319
And then plague was thrown
upon the people of Taft...

02:24.319 --> 02:27.688
that even Jobe didn't
have to deal with... mice.

02:27.688 --> 02:31.924
100 million mice came up out of
a dry lake and marched on Taft.

02:31.924 --> 02:34.227
0nly when thousands of sea gulls

02:34.227 --> 02:36.560
flew over from Ventura County
were they beaten back.

02:36.560 --> 02:39.363
Well, eaten back, actually.

02:39.363 --> 02:42.599
It rained all the next winter.

02:42.599 --> 02:44.567
Bakersfield 82,

02:44.567 --> 02:46.500
Taft 6.

02:47.635 --> 02:50.331
It seems like every year
they beat us 82 to 6,

02:51.138 --> 02:54.207
but in 1972, something happened.

02:54.207 --> 02:56.976
A great athlete rose
up out of the Taft desert

02:56.976 --> 02:59.544
to cast a shadow beyond
the boundaries of Kern County.

02:59.544 --> 03:03.248
A greek god, a leader of men,
a quarterback.

03:03.248 --> 03:05.681
A great quarterback.

03:05.681 --> 03:08.851
We had Reno Hightower.

03:08.851 --> 03:12.020
At last, a chance to beat Bakersfield.

03:12.020 --> 03:16.023
November 15, 1972,
our moment in history,

03:16.023 --> 03:18.391
only seconds left
in a scoreless game.

03:18.391 --> 03:20.025
Reno goes back to pass.
A golden arm...

03:20.025 --> 03:21.526
He lets it fly...
and as he does...

03:21.526 --> 03:24.829
he's hit by half of the Bakersfield team.

03:24.829 --> 03:28.131
His knee is smashed.
His career is over.

03:28.131 --> 03:31.333
But what a pass.
Sixty-five yards in the air.

03:31.333 --> 03:34.270
At least we still had a chance
to beat Bakersfield.

03:34.270 --> 03:36.069
And somebody's open!

03:36.069 --> 03:37.638
Some third-string wide receiver.

03:37.638 --> 03:40.140
The ball's laid right in his hands,

03:40.140 --> 03:43.404
but that son-of-a-bitch dropped it!

03:44.644 --> 03:48.412
I was that son-of-a-bitch.

03:48.412 --> 03:51.415
And as you can see,
my mistake was so horrible,

03:51.415 --> 03:53.916
not only has it haunted me
ever since,

03:53.916 --> 03:59.053
but it's forced the entire town to
slip quietly into oblivion forever.

03:59.053 --> 04:00.953
Sort of like Kid Lester.

04:06.992 --> 04:09.395
I'm sorry, sir.
Your wife is here.

04:09.395 --> 04:11.129
Thank you, Marcy.

04:11.129 --> 04:12.619
Go file something.

04:13.564 --> 04:15.499
I should've caught the damn thing.

04:15.499 --> 04:17.966
What can I do for you?

04:17.966 --> 04:19.668
I'm sorry to disturb you at work.

04:19.668 --> 04:21.269
I know you're a busy man.

04:21.269 --> 04:23.203
Could the bank make a
$100 donation

04:23.203 --> 04:25.672
to the Women's Club production
of "Fiddler on the Roof"?

04:25.672 --> 04:28.574
- We're doing a modern version.
- "If I were that rich dude."

04:28.574 --> 04:30.609
How about $200?

04:30.609 --> 04:33.645
Jack, you're a doll.
Jaki's class is having a party.

04:33.645 --> 04:36.079
Could you drop off
some potato chips?

04:36.079 --> 04:38.014
Honey, I'm the Vice President
of a bank.

04:38.014 --> 04:39.683
- I'm very busy...
- Ruffles.

04:39.683 --> 04:41.274
You have it.

04:42.518 --> 04:43.746
Hon?

04:44.486 --> 04:45.887
Are you happy?

04:45.887 --> 04:47.087
I'm happy.

04:47.087 --> 04:49.189
Don't just say that to make me happy.

04:49.189 --> 04:51.248
- Are you happy?
- I'm happy!

04:52.492 --> 04:53.693
Me, too.

04:53.693 --> 04:55.160
0h, my god.

04:55.160 --> 04:56.261
Daddy's here.

04:56.261 --> 04:57.462
Mayday!

04:57.462 --> 04:59.697
Look busy.

04:59.697 --> 05:02.666
- Does this look busy?
- Looks busy to me.

05:04.168 --> 05:05.434
Surprise!

05:05.434 --> 05:06.835
Hello.

05:06.835 --> 05:09.271
Bring it in, boys.
0n the wall behind the desk.

05:09.271 --> 05:10.838
What's that?

05:10.838 --> 05:15.442
Me. I had ten painted.
0ne for each bank.

05:15.442 --> 05:18.410
All in the tradition of Velazquez.

05:18.410 --> 05:20.244
So, what do you think?

05:20.244 --> 05:21.946
I like Velazquez.

05:21.946 --> 05:24.747
He's damn good for a Mexican, huh?

05:24.747 --> 05:26.816
What are you doing?
Trying to look busy?

05:26.816 --> 05:28.613
Look busy, sir?
I am busy.

05:30.952 --> 05:32.354
Don't get hurt.

05:32.354 --> 05:34.289
Thank you very much for calling.

05:34.289 --> 05:35.618
So, Jack...

05:36.456 --> 05:39.653
What do you think?
Think it's a bit too much?

05:40.926 --> 05:42.561
Tell me the truth.

05:42.561 --> 05:45.363
Well, it's slightly ostentatious.

05:45.363 --> 05:46.863
Damn right!

05:46.863 --> 05:49.165
Grand statement on a grand theme!

05:49.165 --> 05:52.901
No brush strokes.
Paid extra for that.

05:52.901 --> 05:55.303
Well, butterfingers...

05:55.303 --> 05:58.106
Daddy, I'm sorry
you can't stay longer.

05:58.106 --> 06:00.540
Sorry I can't stay
longer, honey.

06:00.540 --> 06:02.042
Got nine more of these to go.

06:02.042 --> 06:03.643
- Is that all?
- Come on, boys.

06:03.643 --> 06:06.378
I hope everything's 0K
in Bakersfield.

06:06.378 --> 06:11.181
0K? Bakersfield High's got
one hell of a team this year!

06:11.181 --> 06:14.014
Should beat Taft 84 to 0 again!

06:15.118 --> 06:16.483
(chuckles)
Bye!

06:19.720 --> 06:21.381
(mocking)
"0K...

06:22.856 --> 06:25.824
Bakersfield High has a great
football team this year!

06:25.824 --> 06:27.693
Should beat Taft..."

06:27.693 --> 06:28.352
[knocking]

06:35.064 --> 06:36.292
0hh.

06:38.734 --> 06:40.469
God damn it!

06:40.469 --> 06:42.904
Why did Reno Hightower
throw that ball to me?

06:42.904 --> 06:44.638
0h, Jack.

06:44.638 --> 06:46.906
You've only seen him once a week
for the last thirteen years.

06:46.906 --> 06:49.242
You've had a thousand chances.
Why don't you ask him?

06:49.242 --> 06:51.611
- What's the problem?
- What's the problem?

06:51.611 --> 06:54.945
The problem is EI,
it's that time of year again

06:54.945 --> 06:57.014
when the first leaf...

06:57.014 --> 07:00.449
"of autumn falls forlornly
on the barren ground below."

07:01.418 --> 07:02.986
EI...

07:02.986 --> 07:05.319
- I'm happy, 0K?
- 0K.

07:05.319 --> 07:07.422
Thanks for the donation.

07:07.422 --> 07:10.084
Don't forget the chips.
Bye-bye.

07:20.464 --> 07:22.565
Aw, Carlos, more sharks.

07:22.565 --> 07:24.699
My client wants lots of sharks.

07:24.699 --> 07:27.436
Lady Di's got to be in deep shit.

07:27.436 --> 07:28.736
It's more emotional.

07:28.736 --> 07:30.704
I thought that was Pia Zadora.

07:32.406 --> 07:34.840
- Is this dry yet?
- Yeah, man. It's ready.

07:34.840 --> 07:36.967
0K, take it down.

07:37.276 --> 07:38.868
Easy, now.

07:39.711 --> 07:41.337
Careful.

07:42.113 --> 07:44.881
What do you think?

07:44.881 --> 07:46.939
- It's your best work, Reno.
- Thanks, man.

07:48.784 --> 07:51.120
(sputtering and backfiring)

07:51.120 --> 07:53.254
A little more shading on the bicep.

07:53.254 --> 07:55.118
God needs more definition.

07:56.356 --> 07:58.458
Hey, Jack. What's your problem?

07:58.458 --> 08:01.086
It sounds like crap.
That's what the problem is.

08:04.728 --> 08:07.064
See, it's clicking.
No, it's pinging.

08:07.064 --> 08:09.633
That's just technical talk.

08:09.633 --> 08:12.235
You need a valve job.

08:12.235 --> 08:13.770
Reno, I need to talk to you.

08:13.770 --> 08:14.336
Not now, honey.

08:14.336 --> 08:16.437
I got a noisy Continental
and a wet Lady Di.

08:16.437 --> 08:19.606
You always got a noisy
Continental and a wet Lady Di.

08:19.606 --> 08:21.141
- Hi, Gigi.
- Hi, Jack.

08:21.141 --> 08:22.541
I want to talk alone.

08:22.541 --> 08:23.633
Come on.

08:31.014 --> 08:34.249
I don't like being embarrassed
like that in front of the guys.

08:34.249 --> 08:36.485
- It's not good for business.
- Sorry.

08:36.485 --> 08:38.587
What do you want, sweetheart?

08:38.587 --> 08:40.386
I want a divorce.

08:40.386 --> 08:42.990
0K. I know your v-dub
needs a new muffler...

08:42.990 --> 08:46.025
Yeah, and ti-rod bushing
and an exhaust manifold...

08:46.025 --> 08:47.559
That's not why I'm here.

08:47.559 --> 08:49.428
I'll get Eddie on it.

08:49.428 --> 08:52.563
My life's out of tune,
not my v-dub.

08:52.563 --> 08:53.965
Well, this is sudden.

08:53.965 --> 08:55.265
No, it's not.

08:55.265 --> 08:56.766
Come on, Reno, face it...

08:56.766 --> 08:58.901
things haven't been
the way they were between us.

08:58.901 --> 09:01.070
They haven't been
that way for a long time.

09:01.070 --> 09:03.272
I made some notes
so I wouldn't mess up.

09:03.272 --> 09:05.405
"I've gotto get out of Taft."

09:05.405 --> 09:09.943
This is no place for
a singer to get launched.

09:09.943 --> 09:12.745
"My mind's made up."
It has been for a long time.

09:12.745 --> 09:16.047
I was waiting for the right time,
but there is no right time.

09:16.047 --> 09:19.983
"L..." I was crying
and the words smudged.

09:19.983 --> 09:22.484
- I can't read this.
- I can read your writing.

09:22.484 --> 09:26.053
"As soon as I get the courage,
I'll talk to Teddy.

09:26.053 --> 09:28.688
I'm sorry, I don't want to
be married to you anymore."

09:28.688 --> 09:30.121
- Right?
- Right.

09:37.128 --> 09:38.596
I... I got to go.

09:38.596 --> 09:40.085
0h, come on, honey.

09:41.465 --> 09:43.634
I'm moving out.

09:43.634 --> 09:45.535
Now, wait a minute, honey.

09:45.535 --> 09:47.035
Bye.

09:47.035 --> 09:48.670
Aw, come on, Gigi.

09:48.670 --> 09:49.932
Aw, shoot.

09:57.210 --> 09:58.710
Ah, a family spat.

09:58.710 --> 10:00.200
Dinner and a movie,
she'll be fine.

10:02.614 --> 10:04.848
Can I offer you some marital advice?

10:04.848 --> 10:05.782
No.

10:05.782 --> 10:08.418
There's only one way a
man can come back to his woman

10:08.418 --> 10:11.253
after she's dumped him
and still maintain one's pride...

10:11.253 --> 10:13.422
There's only one way.

10:13.422 --> 10:15.924
Crawl, with dignity, of course,

10:15.924 --> 10:18.058
and women will forgive anything.

10:18.058 --> 10:19.581
- Shut up, Jack.
- You got it.

10:20.927 --> 10:24.395
Gigi got as far as county line
before she always comes back.

10:24.395 --> 10:26.625
She can't get L.A. Out of her head.

10:27.898 --> 10:30.667
First time she's ever said divorce.

10:30.667 --> 10:32.302
What?

10:32.302 --> 10:33.269
Yeah.

10:34.201 --> 10:37.772
That's a terrible word, Reno,
"Divorce", terrible.

10:37.772 --> 10:40.740
She'll leave me
as soon as I fix her car.

10:40.740 --> 10:43.709
- You gonna fix it?
- Hell, no! I love her!

10:45.177 --> 10:46.644
I don't know what to say.

10:46.644 --> 10:48.009
Neither do I.

10:49.280 --> 10:51.915
You got a burned out
intake valve on number five.

10:51.915 --> 10:53.517
It's going to cost you 400 bucks.

10:53.517 --> 10:55.279
$400?!

10:55.618 --> 10:59.417
How the hell can I argue with you
when your wife just left you.

11:00.355 --> 11:03.058
My great sorrow
at your domestic problems

11:03.058 --> 11:05.592
prevents me from
calling you a crook.

11:05.592 --> 11:07.355
Get out of here.

11:08.728 --> 11:10.395
What about my car?

11:10.395 --> 11:12.664
God damnit!
You've got a choice.

11:12.664 --> 11:14.398
For $400, I'll fix it right,

11:14.398 --> 11:16.766
or for $1.50,
I'll throw in some STP, again.

11:16.766 --> 11:19.368
It'll still run shitty,
but for a week sound great.

11:19.368 --> 11:21.970
- So, what do you want?
- Here's $1.50.

11:21.970 --> 11:23.870
In a week,
I might be dead.

11:23.870 --> 11:26.940
Can I at least have a loaner
so I can get back to the bank?

11:26.940 --> 11:29.141
It'll take 15 minutes.

11:29.141 --> 11:31.234
I've got a board meeting.

11:31.944 --> 11:33.613
That's all I got.

11:33.613 --> 11:35.169
Perfect.

11:52.258 --> 11:54.226
Hey, Jack...

11:54.226 --> 11:57.162
Some of us think you
take a loaner every week

11:57.162 --> 11:59.497
because you're going
to the massage parlor

11:59.497 --> 12:04.567
and need a car you won't
be recognized in.

12:04.567 --> 12:07.866
I won't even dignify that
with a reply.

12:11.006 --> 12:13.838
I've never paid for it
in my life.

12:17.443 --> 12:19.273
Adios, muchacho.

12:36.289 --> 12:38.458
- Visa or Mastercard?
- Visa.

12:38.458 --> 12:39.447
Thanks.

12:41.227 --> 12:44.559
0kay, you can start.
Meter's running.

12:49.166 --> 12:53.802
There are times when a man must look
deep into the bowels of his soul,

12:53.802 --> 12:56.772
into the darkest
chambers where demons lurk.

12:56.772 --> 12:58.406
What's wrong?

12:58.406 --> 13:00.708
- My wife's unhappy.
- How do you know?

13:00.708 --> 13:02.677
Men know.

13:02.677 --> 13:05.310
- Am I a good lover, Darla?
- The best.

13:05.310 --> 13:07.980
Thank you. How do you know?
We never do it.

13:07.980 --> 13:11.416
Women know. Is that what
we're going to talk about?

13:11.416 --> 13:15.018
No. I'm going into
the bowels of hell.

13:15.018 --> 13:16.585
Which bowels of hell?

13:16.585 --> 13:19.587
Taft versus Bakersfield, 1972.

13:19.587 --> 13:21.389
Football.

13:21.389 --> 13:23.515
That's a bowel of hell, all right.

13:25.091 --> 13:28.326
If I'd caught that ball,
my whole life would be different.

13:28.326 --> 13:30.462
This is Ace Jointers and Extruders.

13:30.462 --> 13:33.997
Number 441-06-9542.

13:33.997 --> 13:35.799
$60.

13:35.799 --> 13:37.567
What the hell are you doing?

13:37.567 --> 13:40.035
It's a new rule. We have to
call in anything over $50.

13:40.035 --> 13:42.271
This is outrageous!
I'm emotionally naked!

13:42.271 --> 13:44.572
Get a gold card.
I don't have to call those in.

13:44.572 --> 13:45.772
I've applied.

13:45.772 --> 13:48.475
I want to discuss
my darkest sides!

13:48.475 --> 13:51.844
As soon as I get approval.
I hate this, too.

13:51.844 --> 13:55.313
It hit me right in the hands!

13:55.313 --> 13:58.082
Thank you.
Sorry, Jack. It's no good.

13:58.082 --> 14:00.217
You're right. It's no good.
I can't live like this.

14:00.217 --> 14:01.919
The card!

14:01.919 --> 14:03.852
I'll sue!

14:03.852 --> 14:06.955
Calm down, Jack.

14:06.955 --> 14:10.658
Maybe we can work
something out for under $50.

14:10.658 --> 14:12.860
Can we discuss the game for $50?

14:12.860 --> 14:14.486
- Aw, Jack!
- Please.

14:16.695 --> 14:19.997
I know every county
line in San Jaquine valley.

14:19.997 --> 14:22.365
I came here for a little variety.

14:22.365 --> 14:26.368
All I hear about is some tie game played
13 years ago I can barely remember.

14:26.368 --> 14:28.069
0h, come on, Darla.

14:28.069 --> 14:30.705
You were gridiron princess.

14:30.705 --> 14:32.407
Remember the homecoming queen?

14:32.407 --> 14:36.309
Come on. You remember.
Reno remembers.

14:36.309 --> 14:38.010
The whole town remembers.

14:38.010 --> 14:40.345
- 0K, I remember!
- And?

14:40.345 --> 14:41.913
You should have caught
the damn ball.

14:41.913 --> 14:43.081
0h, I knew it!

14:43.081 --> 14:45.071
0hhh! Aggghhh!

14:49.185 --> 14:50.675
[Sobbing]

14:59.826 --> 15:02.095
Can't you make a comeback?

15:02.095 --> 15:03.595
From what?

15:03.595 --> 15:05.597
I'm not a has-been.

15:05.597 --> 15:07.465
I'm a never-was.

15:07.465 --> 15:09.666
I aspire to be a has-been.

15:09.666 --> 15:14.604
I'm not listening to this crapola,
and it is crapola, every week.

15:14.604 --> 15:16.471
You got unfinished business,
finish it.

15:16.471 --> 15:17.739
How?

15:17.739 --> 15:19.173
Play the game again.

15:19.173 --> 15:21.541
Just play the game again.
You can't play the game again.

15:21.541 --> 15:23.609
- Why not?
- You can't rewrite history.

15:23.609 --> 15:26.011
- Why not?
- It's an unnatural act.

15:26.011 --> 15:28.946
There's no such
thing as an unnatural act.

15:28.946 --> 15:31.182
I should know.
Tell me one good reason

15:31.182 --> 15:32.884
you can't play
that game again?

15:32.884 --> 15:34.550
All right, I'll tell you!

15:34.550 --> 15:36.185
You can't because...

15:36.185 --> 15:37.453
Because...

15:37.453 --> 15:40.012
0ne reason, Jack.
Just one.

15:56.367 --> 15:58.768
- Hey, Teddy.
- Hey, dad.

15:58.768 --> 16:00.203
How was school today?

16:00.203 --> 16:02.305
PE was okay.

16:02.305 --> 16:04.639
Shop teacher started
acting weird again.

16:04.639 --> 16:07.842
He told us Taft, California
was the safest place America

16:07.842 --> 16:09.776
in case of a nuclear war.

16:09.776 --> 16:13.046
- He said it's the winds.
- That's weird enough.

16:13.046 --> 16:14.706
Teddy, are you out there, honey?

16:16.080 --> 16:18.182
I guess mom told you
she's moving?

16:18.182 --> 16:19.950
Yeah, she said something.

16:19.950 --> 16:22.018
It's just to the motel.
She'll be back.

16:22.018 --> 16:24.853
Hell, I know. A women needs
breathing room occasionally.

16:24.853 --> 16:26.388
Hell, I know.

16:26.388 --> 16:29.290
Teddy, give me a hand.

16:29.290 --> 16:30.985
0h, hurry!

16:33.659 --> 16:35.456
Thanks, honey.

16:36.395 --> 16:39.031
I'm bogged down in Taft.

16:39.031 --> 16:41.599
So's your father.
0nly he doesn't know it.

16:41.599 --> 16:43.293
Your father's lost his drive.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.466
0h! Careful!

16:46.836 --> 16:49.238
I'm going to give singing a shot.

16:49.238 --> 16:52.968
I just don't want
to settle for second-best.

16:54.541 --> 16:56.443
Second-best?

16:56.443 --> 16:58.511
Second-best?

16:58.511 --> 17:02.248
I'll tell you why
I don't want to leave Taft.

17:02.248 --> 17:03.881
I'll tell you.

17:03.881 --> 17:05.746
It's a fair question.

17:07.917 --> 17:09.419
You say why...

17:09.419 --> 17:11.721
Why I don't want to leave Taft?

17:11.721 --> 17:15.790
- I'm comfortable here.
- This place is a hellhole.

17:15.790 --> 17:18.124
If you knew anything
you'd know...

17:18.124 --> 17:22.761
Taft has been judged America's
safest city in case of a nuclear war.

17:22.761 --> 17:25.195
It's because of the winds.

17:25.195 --> 17:27.531
Ha! The winds?

17:27.531 --> 17:30.667
0h, man, you're unbelievable!

17:30.667 --> 17:33.902
You think the Russians
won't go for the oil fields?

17:33.902 --> 17:36.972
They'll wipe out our energy.

17:36.972 --> 17:39.473
Taft will be the first to go.

17:39.473 --> 17:42.076
You think they won't hit L. A?

17:42.076 --> 17:48.447
0f course they would, but at least
till then I'd be in the big leagues!

17:48.447 --> 17:51.616
Here's another reason I won't leave.

17:51.616 --> 17:54.551
I have a successful business here.

17:54.551 --> 17:57.319
You owe six months' mortgage.

17:57.319 --> 17:58.721
Five months!

17:58.721 --> 18:00.356
Besides, you can't leave me yet.

18:00.356 --> 18:02.625
Why not?

18:02.625 --> 18:04.488
Your v-dub doesn't work.

18:07.961 --> 18:10.690
I'm taking it to another shop.

18:12.298 --> 18:14.532
0h, wow.

18:14.532 --> 18:17.167
I have never been unfaithful to you.

18:17.167 --> 18:18.668
Never.

18:18.668 --> 18:22.004
0h, you know...

18:22.004 --> 18:24.631
I'm just tired of all the junk.

18:26.040 --> 18:27.941
The junk in my life...

18:27.941 --> 18:30.273
The junk in this yard.

18:32.977 --> 18:36.114
0K, now we're getting somewhere.

18:36.114 --> 18:40.918
Name one piece of junk,
and I'll get rid of it.

18:40.918 --> 18:42.818
You don't even understand.

18:42.818 --> 18:44.487
- I do.
- No, you don't.

18:44.487 --> 18:46.488
Just name one piece of junk...

18:46.488 --> 18:49.150
junk... and it's gone.

18:59.197 --> 19:00.494
What's this?

19:01.800 --> 19:05.502
That's... a '53 Studebaker brake drum.

19:05.502 --> 19:07.037
It's a classic.

19:07.037 --> 19:09.772
Interchangeable with later
model Volvos, small Chevys,

19:09.772 --> 19:12.474
some imported pickups,
'74s to '78s.

19:12.474 --> 19:13.908
Some '79s.

19:13.908 --> 19:15.841
Right.

19:20.946 --> 19:23.641
I'll be at the Top Hat Motel.

19:32.155 --> 19:33.848
[Honking]

19:42.761 --> 19:44.819
Reno, I've got to talk to you.

19:46.364 --> 19:50.535
Reno, I have just
come up with a big idea.

19:50.535 --> 19:52.569
It's a one-in-a-lifetime,
monster concept.

19:52.569 --> 19:54.303
It's a killer.
You want to hear it?

19:54.303 --> 19:55.705
Can't wait.

19:55.705 --> 19:58.036
We play the game again.

19:59.474 --> 20:00.976
What game?

20:00.976 --> 20:02.775
What do you mean,
What game?

20:02.775 --> 20:04.577
The game!

20:04.577 --> 20:06.579
How many were there,
for Christ's sakes?

20:06.579 --> 20:09.715
Your greatest pass,
my greatest drop.

20:09.715 --> 20:11.984
0h, that game.

20:11.984 --> 20:14.218
You and me are going
to breathe new life

20:14.218 --> 20:16.186
into the bowels of our souls.

20:16.186 --> 20:18.287
We'll charge into chambers
where demons lurk

20:18.287 --> 20:20.122
kick the shit out of
the little bastards...

20:20.122 --> 20:23.590
- and change the miserable past.
- I like the miserable past.

20:23.590 --> 20:26.115
0K! All right!
All right! 0K!

20:28.327 --> 20:31.897
If not for me and not for you,

20:31.897 --> 20:34.798
why don't we replay
the game for the whole town.

20:34.798 --> 20:38.427
We can raise Taft out of lethargy.

20:40.636 --> 20:42.904
0kay, you listen to me
for a change.

20:42.904 --> 20:46.173
You dropped the ball.
The whole town didn't.

20:46.173 --> 20:49.710
You want to breathe new life into
the bowels where chambers lurk,

20:49.710 --> 20:50.937
you do it.

20:53.379 --> 20:55.080
Colonel, sir.

20:55.080 --> 21:00.618
I propose we replay
the historic game of 1972.

21:00.618 --> 21:03.419
"Jack, Jack, Jack.

21:03.419 --> 21:05.254
Life is short.

21:05.254 --> 21:08.190
I don't have time for
this descent into this..."

21:08.190 --> 21:10.291
...personal madness of yours.

21:10.291 --> 21:14.328
In layman's terms,
Jack, you make me sick.

21:14.328 --> 21:16.062
Is that a yes?

21:16.062 --> 21:17.496
I'm a busy man.

21:17.496 --> 21:19.865
I got the booster club,
the sports federation...

21:19.865 --> 21:21.866
I've got the Black _
0range Roundtable.

21:21.866 --> 21:26.302
As you know, I'm the CE0
of the new Potato Bowl.

21:26.302 --> 21:28.604
You think I'm here on my own?

21:28.604 --> 21:30.205
Who could you represent?

21:30.205 --> 21:34.007
Taft. The entire god damn town.

21:34.007 --> 21:36.510
I am throwing down the gauntlet!

21:36.510 --> 21:38.378
Gauntlet, my ass!

21:38.378 --> 21:41.647
- I don't believe this!
- Are you afraid, Colonel?

21:41.647 --> 21:44.249
Poor Elly, ten years
ago I gave you a job

21:44.249 --> 21:46.550
so she wouldn't be
married to a bum.

21:46.550 --> 21:48.552
The day I hear she's
thrown you out,

21:48.552 --> 21:51.154
is the day you resign
from the bank

21:51.154 --> 21:53.989
and slip quietly
out of town forever,

21:53.989 --> 21:57.625
- sort of like Kid Lester.
- That was a lucky punch.

21:57.625 --> 22:01.195
Victories for the underdog are
aberrations of the universal order.

22:01.195 --> 22:06.065
That's why I've had few losses.

22:06.065 --> 22:08.900
The biggest was
you marrying my daughter.

22:08.900 --> 22:12.562
She could have had Johnny "0".

22:14.004 --> 22:18.339
You must admit she'd have been better
off married to this great halfback.

22:18.339 --> 22:20.241
I wouldn't say that.

22:20.241 --> 22:24.277
Bakersfield high
school football is my life.

22:24.277 --> 22:26.411
And your tax write-off.

22:26.411 --> 22:29.714
Tax loopholes are a god-given right!

22:29.714 --> 22:32.582
Probably even constitutional.

22:32.582 --> 22:35.518
These young men
are like sons to me.

22:35.518 --> 22:39.388
Look at this.
Great men, great poses.

22:39.388 --> 22:42.091
There's more to life than this.

22:42.091 --> 22:45.759
0h, Jack, you can't even pose.

22:45.759 --> 22:50.930
In your entire life, you've
done one significantly correct thing.

22:50.930 --> 22:53.064
What was that, sir?

22:53.064 --> 22:55.967
You dropped the ball.

22:55.967 --> 22:59.236
You verified the order of things.

22:59.236 --> 23:01.939
We accept the challenge.

23:01.939 --> 23:04.539
Well, thank you, sir.

23:04.539 --> 23:07.702
With all due respect,
we'll kick your ass.

23:09.310 --> 23:11.745
You're replaying what game?

23:11.745 --> 23:14.746
I'm sick of games and hearing
about some ball you dropped.

23:14.746 --> 23:16.715
I'm sick of anything
with a ball in it.

23:16.715 --> 23:20.017
Let me rephrase my intentions.

23:20.017 --> 23:23.452
What I propose to do,
stated rather simply,

23:23.452 --> 23:26.088
is to remake history.

23:26.088 --> 23:28.282
Pass the lima beans, please.

23:31.459 --> 23:34.427
We'll blitz like Dick Butkus
into the future and

23:34.427 --> 23:39.261
throw a vicious forearm shiver on
the demon ball carriers of the past.

23:41.199 --> 23:44.467
I don't want to talk about
Dick Butkus at the dinner table.

23:44.467 --> 23:45.869
I told you that.

23:45.869 --> 23:48.171
Who's Dick Butkus?

23:48.171 --> 23:50.539
All American Linebacker for
the University of Illinois.

23:50.539 --> 23:54.142
11 years all-pro with the Bears.
Now he's doing beer commercials.

23:54.142 --> 23:56.109
And I still don't want
to talk about him.

23:56.109 --> 23:57.711
That's fine, Elly.

23:57.711 --> 24:00.280
But this town is headed
into the bowels of hell.

24:00.280 --> 24:03.214
0nly a great victory can act
as an enema for its soul.

24:03.214 --> 24:05.350
That is gross, dad.

24:05.350 --> 24:07.619
Can I be excused?

24:07.619 --> 24:10.521
Can't we stay at the table and
talk like other families?

24:10.521 --> 24:13.055
[Doorbell play Taft's Alma mater]
Entre.

24:13.055 --> 24:18.092
I'm sick of our doorbell
playing Taft's Alma mater.

24:18.092 --> 24:20.527
- It's a great tune!
- Can I be excused?

24:20.527 --> 24:22.494
I don't like your fights.

24:22.494 --> 24:24.696
It's not a fight.

24:24.696 --> 24:26.364
It's a disagreement.

24:26.364 --> 24:27.765
I forgot.

24:27.765 --> 24:29.233
Did you finish your
thank-you notes?

24:29.233 --> 24:30.701
0ui.

24:42.442 --> 24:45.178
No, she doesn't.
I do.

24:45.178 --> 24:48.181
I've lived with that
dropped ball for 13 years!

24:48.181 --> 24:49.749
I knew you weren't happy.

24:49.749 --> 24:51.616
0nly when you talk
about happiness.

24:51.616 --> 24:53.384
The rest of the time
I never think about it.

24:53.384 --> 24:55.519
That's why we'll kill Bakersfield.

24:55.519 --> 24:59.255
If you play that game again,
you'll humiliate me,

24:59.255 --> 25:03.758
you'll humiliate the town and
yourself worse than you can imagine.

25:03.758 --> 25:05.960
You don't think I'll catch it?

25:05.960 --> 25:08.728
I don't care if you catch it,
drop it or sit on it!

25:08.728 --> 25:10.597
How can I live with someone
who doesn't care?

25:10.597 --> 25:12.198
Jack, you're torturing me!

25:12.198 --> 25:14.961
You call the meaning of life torture?

25:20.836 --> 25:23.738
I hate it when we shout.

25:23.738 --> 25:25.607
Me, too.

25:25.607 --> 25:28.336
Jaki's out of the house.

25:29.743 --> 25:32.039
Mr. Weasel's here.

25:33.545 --> 25:35.775
Bon appetit.

25:37.982 --> 25:39.745
0h, Jack.

25:41.252 --> 25:43.946
Elly, I've got a
new move for you.

25:45.221 --> 25:46.789
Show me.

25:46.789 --> 25:49.124
It's part Smokey Robinson,
part Gladys Knight,

25:49.124 --> 25:50.454
but it's all me.

gotta satisfy.

26:02.166 --> 26:04.168
Sort of a white pip.

26:04.168 --> 26:06.503
I love it.

26:06.503 --> 26:09.528
I love that we can
have sex after fighting.

26:11.773 --> 26:14.297
We do fight about stupid things.

26:15.643 --> 26:16.870
Stupid?

26:18.311 --> 26:20.879
The game. Give me a kiss.

26:20.879 --> 26:22.847
Honey, let me clarify something.

26:22.847 --> 26:26.149
Just because we're making
up after our disagreement

26:26.149 --> 26:29.753
doesn't necessarily mean that
the terms of that disagreement

26:29.753 --> 26:33.121
are necessarily resolved.

26:33.121 --> 26:34.990
Am I right?

26:34.990 --> 26:40.894
I've given you every Monday night for
13 years so you could watch football.

26:40.894 --> 26:46.999
I've given you most bowl games,
excluding, of course,

26:46.999 --> 26:51.502
the hula and blue-gray, which
coincide with our theater production

26:51.502 --> 26:53.203
at the petroleum club.

26:53.203 --> 26:56.296
You've been more than fair.

26:57.740 --> 27:02.676
But for the last few
years and the last few months,

27:02.676 --> 27:06.146
your demons have
become my demons,

27:06.146 --> 27:08.409
and quite frankly, baby...

27:09.882 --> 27:12.450
I can't take it anymore.

27:12.450 --> 27:14.551
0hh. Who can?

27:14.551 --> 27:18.454
And not to mention,
If you play that game again,

27:18.454 --> 27:24.792
I'll have to put up with a whole
new batch of crap from my father.

27:24.792 --> 27:26.660
0h.

27:26.660 --> 27:29.529
I am playing that game again, EI.

27:29.529 --> 27:33.164
Jack, if you play
that game again,

27:33.164 --> 27:36.334
you're not
sleeping in this bed.

27:36.334 --> 27:39.169
Honey, now who's torturing who?

27:39.169 --> 27:41.204
It's a tough choice?

27:41.204 --> 27:43.538

29:10.802 --> 29:13.133
Don't be here when I get back.

29:35.018 --> 29:36.576
Right.

29:42.057 --> 29:44.191
0h, that's a nice sky.

29:44.191 --> 29:45.954
Looks like Taft.

29:51.797 --> 29:53.999
This time I think she's
going to leave me

29:53.999 --> 29:56.367
even if I don't fix her car.

29:56.367 --> 29:58.597
I know how you can
get her back.

30:00.738 --> 30:01.804
No, you don't, Jack.

30:01.804 --> 30:05.341
Yes, I do, Reno.
I really do.

30:05.341 --> 30:08.070
Come on.
I want to show you something.

30:12.746 --> 30:14.914
Pose for me.

30:14.914 --> 30:16.048
What?

30:16.048 --> 30:19.417
- Nobody could pose like you.
- 0h, my god.

30:19.417 --> 30:22.118

stiff arming the tackler

30:22.118 --> 30:24.053
and your right arm's cocked
for quick release.

in the history of Kern County

30:45.502 --> 30:47.337
to have white shoes!

30:47.337 --> 30:50.339

"Reno! Reno! Reno!"

31:17.859 --> 31:19.893

31:19.893 --> 31:23.429
You can't remake history
without an offensive line.

31:23.429 --> 31:25.197
We'll get an offensive line.

33:12.841 --> 33:15.036
Charlie, I got to ask you a question.

33:16.644 --> 33:18.546
Do you think Taft's lethargic?

33:18.546 --> 33:21.280
Damn right. Proud of it.

33:21.280 --> 33:24.616
You don't think we ought to
rise up out of lethargy

33:24.616 --> 33:27.685
and breathe new life
into the bowels of our soul?

33:27.685 --> 33:31.587
Hell no. We got it made.
No one bothers us.

33:31.587 --> 33:37.425

Annually and make it miserable.

33:37.425 --> 33:40.061
You know how many people
moved into Taft last year?

33:40.061 --> 33:43.362
- Just Arthur and Earl.
- That's right.

33:43.362 --> 33:45.965
And if you ask me Arthur won't last.

33:45.965 --> 33:47.489
Come here, Charlie.

33:48.733 --> 33:51.902
Jack Dundee's going
to be coming in here.

33:51.902 --> 33:54.771
He's got a crazy idea
and needs the men of Taft...

33:54.771 --> 33:57.106
he's going to tell you
I'm part of it, but I'm not.

33:57.106 --> 34:02.276
Whatever he asks,
you just tell him no.

34:02.276 --> 34:05.074
Anything for a brother Caribou.

34:13.384 --> 34:18.853
In short, gentlemen,
we really need the men of Taft

34:18.853 --> 34:26.493
to forge from the foundry of
history a new past and a new future

34:26.493 --> 34:31.830
with, hopefully, a new
present caught in the middle.

34:31.830 --> 34:36.960
In closing, I have to say,
Bakersfield must be destroyed!

34:47.309 --> 34:51.011
Motion's on the floor.
Anyone second it?

34:51.011 --> 34:52.145
Second.

34:52.145 --> 34:55.581
Any motion not on the
agenda requires a second second

34:55.581 --> 34:57.550
before discussion.
Second second?

34:57.550 --> 34:58.951
Second second.

34:58.951 --> 34:59.518
- Discussion?
- Discussion.

34:59.518 --> 35:00.718
Second.

35:00.718 --> 35:04.054
Chair thanks Mac Lynch
for seconding these motions

35:04.054 --> 35:06.457
and opens the floor
to discussing the motion

35:06.457 --> 35:11.259
that Taft challenge Bakersfield
to settle the question of who

35:11.259 --> 35:12.693
or is it "whom?"

35:12.693 --> 35:13.828
- Who.
- Second.

35:13.828 --> 35:16.229
Who was the best...

35:16.229 --> 35:20.199
Bestest. Best. Bestest. Best. Better.

35:20.199 --> 35:21.432
Second.

35:24.935 --> 35:27.204
I'd like to go on
record and say

35:27.204 --> 35:30.374
I despise Bakersfield
as much as any man in this room.

35:30.374 --> 35:34.009
However, we don't need
to get our butts whipped again

35:34.009 --> 35:38.145
by some giant metropolitan city
that has an unfair advantage anyway.

35:38.145 --> 35:41.714
- Exactly.
- Sounds like you're scared.

35:41.714 --> 35:43.915
Yeah! That you'll drop
the damn ball!

35:43.915 --> 35:45.150
0rder!

35:45.150 --> 35:47.352
0rder unto the Caribou!

35:47.352 --> 35:48.686
I'm 0K.

35:48.686 --> 35:51.688
Brother Caribou,
let's not rush to judgment.

35:51.688 --> 35:55.891
Jack may have stumbled
across an idea here.

35:55.891 --> 36:02.796
If Jack, who screwed up so badly,
is willing to replay the game,

36:02.796 --> 36:06.133
then we ought to throw some antlers
in the ring and kick some ass.

36:06.133 --> 36:08.167
Yeah!

36:08.167 --> 36:09.535
Kick some ass.

36:09.535 --> 36:12.603
No one hates the scum of
Bakersfield worse than I do.

36:12.603 --> 36:14.905
Half the old team lives out of town.

36:14.905 --> 36:17.473
And the half that don't
is in miserable shape.

36:17.473 --> 36:20.975

Luther Jackson lives in San Jose.

36:23.978 --> 36:26.746
Where's Mando, Bam Bam,
and Dickie Larue?

36:26.746 --> 36:28.982
We'll get them back
and we will get in shape.

36:28.982 --> 36:31.082
- We're not organized.
- We'll get organized.

36:31.082 --> 36:32.817
It's against the bylaws.

36:32.817 --> 36:36.420
- What? Getting in shape?
- Shit no. Getting organized.

36:36.420 --> 36:39.656
Have we no dignity or pride?

36:39.656 --> 36:41.223
I object to your insinuations!

36:41.223 --> 36:43.124
Sit down, Jack!

36:43.124 --> 36:45.558
0rder to the Caribou!

36:49.496 --> 36:51.395
Aaaoooo!

36:58.036 --> 37:01.004
I say in summation,
Jack's idea, no offense,

37:01.004 --> 37:02.539
is sprinkled with horseshit.

37:02.539 --> 37:03.907
Discussion over!

37:03.907 --> 37:10.012
All those who think Jack's proposition
is horseshit signify by saying aye.

37:10.012 --> 37:11.612
Aye!

37:11.612 --> 37:12.245
0pposed.

37:12.245 --> 37:13.814
No.

37:13.814 --> 37:16.015
Ayes are above nos.

37:16.015 --> 37:18.683
- I propose we head to for bar.
- Second.

37:31.726 --> 37:33.994

to disturb me here.

37:33.994 --> 37:38.164
Excuse me for interrupting you,
but the Colonel's on the phone.

37:38.164 --> 37:39.132

37:41.934 --> 37:44.969
I've got a problem.
Nobody here wants to play the game.

37:44.969 --> 37:47.371
Having any luck over there?

37:47.371 --> 37:50.473
There's a lot of excitement here.

37:50.473 --> 37:55.243
I got no players, no coaches, nothing.

37:55.243 --> 37:57.045
0h, my god.

37:57.045 --> 38:00.379
Is there any way
I could get out of this?

38:00.379 --> 38:03.983
You've put me in a difficult position

38:03.983 --> 38:07.886
because everyone here's
giddy with expectation.

38:07.886 --> 38:16.425
I suppose I could let you
off the hook, but you'll owe me one.

38:16.425 --> 38:19.026
Jack-o, just kidding!

38:19.026 --> 38:20.794
You went for the fake as usual.

38:20.794 --> 38:21.852
Pardon me?

38:23.663 --> 38:26.165
Jack, say hello to Tony Tiger!

38:26.165 --> 38:28.599
Grrr!

38:29.602 --> 38:31.568
Jack, we'll eat you alive.

38:31.568 --> 38:33.971
All right,
here are the rules.

38:33.971 --> 38:36.372
0nly men from
the '72 team can play.

38:36.372 --> 38:39.408
We'll go fifteen minute
quarters, NFL style.

38:39.408 --> 38:42.409
0ne point conversions.
We're pros, right?

38:42.409 --> 38:44.678
0ne more thing, Iron Hands.

38:44.678 --> 38:49.774
When you put on your uniform,
the jockstrap goes on the inside.

39:22.405 --> 39:24.338
Buy me a drink?

39:25.974 --> 39:27.976
Whatever she wants, Chico.

39:27.976 --> 39:30.710
Reno, it's me.

39:30.710 --> 39:32.145
Darla.

39:32.145 --> 39:34.347
Darla Robinson!

39:34.347 --> 39:36.916
I didn't recognize you!

39:36.916 --> 39:39.018
It's been what, 12 years?

39:39.018 --> 39:40.712
13.

39:51.126 --> 39:52.928
Have you seen Jack?

39:52.928 --> 39:57.164
He drives around the house
every night, circles the block,

39:57.164 --> 39:59.865
and heads to the motel.

39:59.865 --> 40:01.466
- Seen Reno?
- No.

40:01.466 --> 40:06.804
I think he's been sneaking out to
Darla's the past couple of months.

40:06.804 --> 40:08.706
Darla? Please.

40:08.706 --> 40:10.106
Do you think Jack
ever went out there?

40:10.106 --> 40:12.630
0f course not. I'd know.

40:20.046 --> 40:22.515
I remember it
like it was yesterday.

40:22.515 --> 40:25.350
I was standing on the fifty
yard line at half time.

40:25.350 --> 40:32.522
I was the damn homecoming queen,
surrounded by rocket princesses.

40:32.522 --> 40:33.716
And pregnant.

40:35.924 --> 40:38.694
We both screwed up.

40:38.694 --> 40:40.761
What do they want?

40:40.761 --> 40:44.397
It's simple what men want.
What men want is more eye make-up.

40:44.397 --> 40:46.867
Lots and lots of eye make-up.

40:46.867 --> 40:49.335
Heavy liner on the bottom lid.

40:49.335 --> 40:51.199
Thank you, Linda.

40:54.471 --> 40:57.304
Hey, Darla,
I got to ask you something.

40:58.675 --> 41:02.444
How many touchdown passes did
I throw against Porterville in '72?

41:02.444 --> 41:05.313
Six. You were terrific.

41:05.313 --> 41:08.082
You were a terrific bastard, too.

41:08.082 --> 41:11.017
But we were undefeated, so it was 0K.

41:11.017 --> 41:13.685
You seem nicer now.

41:13.685 --> 41:15.879
- Nicer?
- Yeah.

41:27.395 --> 41:28.555
Hit it.

41:33.266 --> 41:37.099
I always dreamed the
boy I loved would come along.

41:45.041 --> 41:49.272
He'd be tall, handsome,
rich, and strong.

41:50.711 --> 41:53.543
Now that boy I love has come to me.

41:56.416 --> 41:59.112
But it sure ain't the
way I thought it would be.

42:00.985 --> 42:04.422
# Sha-la-la-la
Hey, hey, hey #

42:04.422 --> 42:07.791
# Sha-la-la-la
Hey, hey, hey #

42:07.791 --> 42:11.260
# Sha-la-la-la
Hey, hey, hey #

42:11.260 --> 42:13.693
# 'cause you're the boy I love #

42:14.296 --> 42:17.597
# He don't look like a movie star #

42:17.597 --> 42:21.900
# He don't drive a cadillac car #

42:21.900 --> 42:24.669
# Sure ain't the boy I been dreamin' of #

42:24.669 --> 42:27.160
# but sure is the boy I love #

42:37.412 --> 42:40.514
#... when he holds me tight #

42:40.514 --> 42:44.210
# Everything's right crazy
as it seems #

42:45.551 --> 42:50.721
# I'm his wherever he is
and I forget all of my dreams #

42:50.721 --> 42:52.556
# Everybody knows #

42:52.556 --> 42:55.858
# He doesn't hang diamonds
'round my neck #

42:55.858 --> 42:59.195
# And all he's got's an
unemployment check #

42:59.195 --> 43:02.229
# He sure ain't the boy
I been dreamin' of #

43:02.229 --> 43:04.527
# but he's sure the boy I love #

43:14.138 --> 43:17.440
# I'm his wherever he is #

43:17.440 --> 43:19.808
# But don't forget all
of your dreams #

43:19.808 --> 43:21.376
# But I love him so #

43:21.376 --> 43:23.844
# He doesn't hang
diamonds 'round your neck #

43:23.844 --> 43:27.881
# And all he's got's an
unemployment check #

43:27.881 --> 43:30.849
# Sure ain't the boy
I been dreamin' of #

43:30.849 --> 43:33.352
# But sure the boy I love #

43:33.352 --> 43:34.386
# Whoa-ho-ho. #

43:34.386 --> 43:36.751
Bakersfield kicks ass!

43:42.124 --> 43:43.557
Who was that?

43:47.595 --> 43:49.391
Who the hell did that?

43:50.897 --> 43:53.626
Damn tiger!
I'm going to kick his ass!

43:55.234 --> 43:57.259
I'll kill that bastard.

44:08.878 --> 44:11.242
0f all the dirty tricks!

44:12.646 --> 44:14.514
There's a lunatic out there.

44:14.514 --> 44:16.783
Lunatic, my ass.
It's Bakersfield.

44:16.783 --> 44:18.350
What's is going on here?

44:18.350 --> 44:20.451
Chickenshit son of a bitches.

44:20.451 --> 44:21.919
It's terrorism.

44:21.919 --> 44:25.188
Simple god damn terrorism.

44:25.188 --> 44:26.757
We've been violated.

44:26.757 --> 44:28.125
I don't understand this.

44:28.125 --> 44:29.257
That's how they work.

44:29.257 --> 44:32.060
They confuse you,
then divide and conquer.

44:32.060 --> 44:33.428
That's how terrorism works.

44:33.428 --> 44:35.562
Damn right.

44:35.562 --> 44:39.232
1971 wasn't 42 to 0.
That was 35 to 0.

44:39.232 --> 44:41.256
This graffiti's all wrong.

44:43.001 --> 44:45.265
0h, my god!

44:46.171 --> 44:48.263
Charlie.

44:49.572 --> 44:51.541
They broke my gavel.

44:51.541 --> 44:54.076
Attacking symbols
of office and authority.

44:54.076 --> 44:56.169
It's nihilism, I tell you.

44:57.413 --> 44:58.747
They defaced our women.

44:58.747 --> 45:01.305
We must redeem our dignity and pride.

45:02.849 --> 45:05.052
We'll redeem your
dignity and pride.

45:05.052 --> 45:07.453
My dignity and pride
are just fine, thanks.

45:07.453 --> 45:09.154
I know you're upset.

45:09.154 --> 45:10.922
No shit!

45:10.922 --> 45:13.524
We'll kill Bakersfield for you, ma'am!

45:13.524 --> 45:15.191
Well, I don't care.

45:15.191 --> 45:17.092
You understand that?

45:17.092 --> 45:18.994
She cares.

45:18.994 --> 45:21.095
I propose a vote without
a quorum...

45:21.095 --> 45:25.799
that Reno Hightower was the greatest
quarterback in the history of America!

45:25.799 --> 45:27.133
Yeah!

45:27.133 --> 45:28.501
Right!

45:28.501 --> 45:30.768
Reno, you're going
to play ball again.

45:30.768 --> 45:32.637
Who said anybody
was replaying anything?

45:32.637 --> 45:34.839
Rosie, tell them
this is all unnecessary.

45:34.839 --> 45:38.442
Actually, I'd like
to have my honor defended.

45:38.442 --> 45:40.176
Yeah!

45:40.176 --> 45:43.478
Jack, is it too late
to get the game on?

45:43.478 --> 45:45.343
Geez, I don't know.

45:46.514 --> 45:48.447
Ask Mr. Hightower.

45:51.017 --> 45:52.785
God damn it.

45:52.785 --> 45:55.582
Let's kill Bakersfield!

45:58.790 --> 46:02.058
If I ever find who
did this, I'll kill him!

46:02.058 --> 46:07.563
Land of hope and glory
'neath the azure skies

46:07.563 --> 46:12.499
where our friendships are welded

46:12.499 --> 46:15.797
ever bonded our ties.

46:50.126 --> 46:52.328
Getting in shape isn't enough.

46:52.328 --> 46:55.063
To remake history,
we need an edge.

46:55.063 --> 46:57.599
We don't need an edge,
we need an offensive line.

46:57.599 --> 47:00.930
We need Felipe, Mando,
Bam Bam, Dickie Larue!

47:10.374 --> 47:11.965
Felipe!

47:12.976 --> 47:15.010
Bam Bam!

47:15.010 --> 47:16.272
Mando. Mando.

47:17.612 --> 47:20.080
Bam Bam. Bam Bam!

47:20.080 --> 47:21.911
Dickie Larue!

47:22.716 --> 47:25.885
Return to the scene
of their greatest triumphs.

47:25.885 --> 47:27.253
Ready!

47:27.253 --> 47:29.019
Set!

47:29.019 --> 47:30.145
Hut!

47:34.625 --> 47:36.182
Hut! Hut!

47:45.933 --> 47:49.067
0ur offensive line sounds
like a tuberculosis ward.

47:49.067 --> 47:50.836
We got to get scientific.

47:50.836 --> 47:52.826
- What do you mean?
- Aerobics.

47:53.571 --> 47:54.970
What?

47:55.072 --> 47:59.375
1... 2... 3... 4...

47:59.375 --> 48:03.078
And 1... 2... 3... 4...

48:03.078 --> 48:04.306
and 1...

48:05.346 --> 48:07.815
Get those legs up there, girls.

48:07.815 --> 48:08.712
Yes!

48:13.985 --> 48:16.010
Now dessert!

48:24.660 --> 48:26.787
Well, what do you think?

48:30.397 --> 48:32.299
I think it's pathetic.

48:32.299 --> 48:35.768
Makes a grown man want to cry.
We gotta get back to fundamentals.

48:35.768 --> 48:37.861
- No shit.
- How do we do that?

48:50.278 --> 48:53.147
Men, this is the play book.

48:53.147 --> 48:56.016
There's more than 200 plays in here.

48:56.016 --> 48:59.618
Learn every damn one.

48:59.618 --> 49:01.987
What kind of offense
will Taft run?

49:01.987 --> 49:05.823
0ffense? They're probably
drawing plays in the dirt.

49:05.823 --> 49:08.658
Eddie, this pebble is you.
Chico, you're the bottle cap.

49:08.658 --> 49:11.160
Run a post to this piece of glass.

49:11.160 --> 49:13.628
I thought I was the glass.

49:13.628 --> 49:15.296
You're the twig, damn it!

49:15.296 --> 49:16.964
Twig.

49:16.964 --> 49:19.198
Just go long.

49:19.198 --> 49:21.934
0K. On 4.
Ready? Break!

49:21.934 --> 49:26.504
# Land of hope and glory #

49:26.504 --> 49:31.941
# 'neath the azure skies #

49:31.941 --> 49:36.912

49:36.912 --> 49:42.282

49:42.282 --> 49:46.819

# in the valley so fertile #

50:08.002 --> 50:14.802
# Land of our Alma mater

51:00.171 --> 51:02.731
BIG RE0PENING S00N

51:16.150 --> 51:18.817
Gigi, they've all gone crazy.

51:18.817 --> 51:23.753
Sometimes I think Reno never
knew how to get through to me.

51:27.958 --> 51:30.159
Gigi, I know you're inside.

51:30.159 --> 51:31.994
I want to talk.

51:31.994 --> 51:33.621
Honey?

51:35.129 --> 51:41.334
0K, honey, just listen
to me and... remember.

51:41.334 --> 51:43.069
God.

51:43.069 --> 51:48.972
# Why do birds suddenly appear... #

51:48.972 --> 51:50.607
This is low.

51:50.607 --> 51:52.742
What a cheap shot.

51:52.742 --> 51:54.877
#... every time you are near #

51:54.877 --> 52:00.247
# Just like me they like to be... #

52:00.247 --> 52:03.617
Gigi, we got to get you out of here.

52:03.617 --> 52:09.521
# Why do stars fall down
from the sky #

52:09.521 --> 52:13.717
# every time you walk by #

52:15.125 --> 52:17.026
This way.
0ut the window.

52:17.026 --> 52:19.027
Come on. Shh.

52:19.027 --> 52:22.129
# Close to you #

52:22.129 --> 52:28.333
# on the day that you were
born the angels got together #

52:28.333 --> 52:33.271
# and decided to create
a dream come true #

52:33.271 --> 52:37.041
Careful.
Let's get out of here.

52:37.041 --> 52:41.810
#... hair of gold and
starlight in your eyes of blue #

52:41.810 --> 52:44.005
tiddle-um, tiddle-um.

52:59.423 --> 53:03.761
Look at all that phony,
virile, pseudo-macho posing.

53:03.761 --> 53:06.129
Yeah.
They look great.

53:06.129 --> 53:08.397
Yeah.

53:08.397 --> 53:10.231
Maybe we've been too rough on them.

53:10.231 --> 53:12.800
I know you don't want to se Reno.

53:12.800 --> 53:15.535
Maybe I could ask Jack to dinner.

53:15.535 --> 53:17.136
Just to talk, of course.

53:17.136 --> 53:18.736
You caving in?

53:18.736 --> 53:22.296
No! There'd be very
strict ground rules.

53:25.208 --> 53:27.267
What kind of ground rules?

53:36.450 --> 53:39.752
We shouldn't have trouble
with the ground rules.

53:39.752 --> 53:41.820
What ground rules?

53:41.820 --> 53:44.823
There's two things
we can't talk about.

53:44.823 --> 53:46.190
What?

53:46.190 --> 53:47.891
Football and sex.

53:47.891 --> 53:49.893
0h...

53:49.893 --> 53:52.087
Jesus, what will we talk about?

53:52.795 --> 53:55.127
What are we going to talk about?

53:56.432 --> 54:00.196
Steer clear of anything personal.
Don't make it too hard on them.

54:02.669 --> 54:05.137
What if they pass
the Monday-night test?

54:05.137 --> 54:06.968
Then we can get personal.

54:08.273 --> 54:11.901
I'm not getting personal.
I don't care how good they look.

54:13.743 --> 54:15.111
How do I look?

54:15.111 --> 54:16.812
You look hot.

54:16.812 --> 54:18.279
I look like a dork.

54:18.279 --> 54:20.907
You look hot.

54:22.315 --> 54:24.851
What are we going to talk about?

54:24.851 --> 54:26.853
What are we going to talk about?

54:26.853 --> 54:28.920
Go with the flow.

54:28.920 --> 54:31.155
If things go well,

54:31.155 --> 54:33.424
the old magical glow
could kick in...

54:33.424 --> 54:34.891
we might even score.

54:34.891 --> 54:37.327
We got to be careful.

54:37.327 --> 54:41.429
Right, careful.
With a hint of reckless.

54:41.429 --> 54:44.299

- Hi, Mr. Dundee.
- Hi, boys.

54:56.341 --> 54:58.408
We didn't think
you'd show up tonight.

54:58.408 --> 54:59.542
Why not?

54:59.542 --> 55:01.711
It's Monday night.
Atlanta-Minnesota.

55:01.711 --> 55:03.576
My god!
Monday Night Football.

55:04.746 --> 55:07.882
They scheduled it
on Monday night on purpose.

55:07.882 --> 55:11.918
Atlanta and Minnesota have
lost 17 straight games between them.

55:11.918 --> 55:14.487
Even we don't want to watch them.

55:14.487 --> 55:16.420
- Hi, dad.
- Hey, Jaki.

to talk about again?

55:40.304 --> 55:43.508
It doesn't matter.
Do not take sides at all costs.

55:43.508 --> 55:45.209
No arguments.

55:45.209 --> 55:47.810
Be bland and be strong.

Bland and strong.

55:53.281 --> 55:55.950
- Hello.
- Hi.

55:55.950 --> 55:57.550
It smells super.

55:57.550 --> 55:59.252
The food.

55:59.252 --> 56:01.621
Better than super.

56:01.621 --> 56:04.222
It's really, really super.

56:04.222 --> 56:06.324
That's sweet of you.

56:06.324 --> 56:08.848
Yeah. Thanks.

56:18.098 --> 56:21.001
We've got a lot to talk about.

56:21.001 --> 56:23.235
Where do we start?

56:23.235 --> 56:29.866
We thought maybe we could
talk about, for example, the world.

56:31.475 --> 56:33.443
Just for starters.

56:34.977 --> 56:38.413
I just can't get a
handle on the middle east.

56:38.413 --> 56:40.047
It's a swamp.

56:40.047 --> 56:42.850
A real mess.
Don't you think so?

56:42.850 --> 56:46.419
Yeah, it's a swamp.

56:46.419 --> 56:48.420
You think, honey?

56:48.420 --> 56:50.322
Th... that it's a swamp?

56:50.322 --> 56:52.123
Hey, absolutely.

56:52.123 --> 56:54.258
I thought so.

56:54.258 --> 56:57.426
It's probably too complex
to talk about over dinner.

56:57.426 --> 57:01.430
You know, there's
always the nuclear question.

57:01.430 --> 57:04.566
Since Taft's the
safest city in America...

57:04.566 --> 57:09.569
I think that whole
area is another swamp, too.

57:09.569 --> 57:11.437
But a very complex one,

57:11.437 --> 57:14.873
a swamp with many levels
of political overtones

57:14.873 --> 57:16.907
that can't be fathomed
at the present time,

57:16.907 --> 57:19.509
but needs the distance of the future
to give it a perspective

57:19.509 --> 57:21.677
so you can truly
have a point of view

57:21.677 --> 57:24.413
and realize viscosity
of that quagmire.

57:24.413 --> 57:27.812
And the only way to understand this
is to realize it's incomprehensible.

57:30.350 --> 57:32.419
It's like at the shop.

57:32.419 --> 57:35.581

You got it.

58:36.565 --> 58:39.000
That's a swamp, too.

58:39.000 --> 58:42.335
With that acidity, normal
swamp creatures can't flourish.

58:42.335 --> 58:45.071
They need salinity to survive.

You once said you liked the way I could
command respect without saying much.

01:02:51.777 --> 01:02:54.881
I was always amazed at the way
you could make so much noise

01:02:54.881 --> 01:02:57.177
without doing anything.

01:02:59.216 --> 01:03:03.620

to call off the game?

01:06:33.302 --> 01:06:35.538
She'll be here, Jack.

01:06:35.538 --> 01:06:37.471
She wants to see her old friends.

01:06:40.675 --> 01:06:41.942
Better?

01:06:41.942 --> 01:06:45.645
That is disgusting.

01:06:45.645 --> 01:06:47.846
Mom, what is this game all about?

01:06:47.846 --> 01:06:49.515
I want to understand.

01:06:49.515 --> 01:06:54.085
In your life, isn't there something
you wish you'd done differently?

01:06:54.085 --> 01:06:57.712
If you could do it over,
you'd change things?

01:06:59.822 --> 01:07:01.687
No.

01:07:02.757 --> 01:07:06.193
Maybe you have to
be a grown-up to understand.

01:07:06.193 --> 01:07:09.896
T-a-f-t.

01:07:09.896 --> 01:07:11.697
Taft!

01:07:11.697 --> 01:07:14.824
That was Gigi and the Blenders!
Let's give a good hand!

01:07:17.567 --> 01:07:20.602
Direct your attention
to the rocket ship.

01:07:20.602 --> 01:07:22.871
Welcome back Luther Jackson,

01:07:22.871 --> 01:07:26.600
the greatest running back
in the history of Kern County!

01:07:30.877 --> 01:07:32.878
It's great to return to one's roots!

01:07:32.878 --> 01:07:34.814
How you doing, man?

01:07:34.814 --> 01:07:36.838
Lighten up!

01:07:55.629 --> 01:07:57.561
Reno, look.

01:07:58.597 --> 01:08:00.132
What do I do now?

01:08:00.132 --> 01:08:01.360
- Be cool.
- Be what?

01:08:05.403 --> 01:08:07.571
She's going straight to Gigi...

01:08:07.571 --> 01:08:09.060
Yeah, and...

01:08:11.239 --> 01:08:13.571
Right to the ladies' room.

01:08:17.577 --> 01:08:19.978
This whole thing is a joke, Gigi.

01:08:19.978 --> 01:08:22.948
He has revived Taft.
Jack's doing everything he said.

01:08:22.948 --> 01:08:24.683
I know.

01:08:24.683 --> 01:08:26.750
It's amazing, ain't it?

01:08:26.750 --> 01:08:28.218
Yes.

01:08:28.218 --> 01:08:30.920
Come on.
Dance with the son of a bitch.

01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:32.488
Why should I?

01:08:32.488 --> 01:08:34.356
Because you want to.

01:08:34.356 --> 01:08:36.823
That's not a good reason.

01:08:36.823 --> 01:08:42.028
Then do it because this is his
moment in the sun.

01:08:42.028 --> 01:08:44.863
Tomorrow is Jack's
moment in the sun... the game.

01:08:44.863 --> 01:08:47.665
No, it's tonight
while there's hope,

01:08:47.665 --> 01:08:51.600
because tomorrow Bakersfield's
going to slaughter us.

01:08:56.638 --> 01:08:58.540
They've been in there forever.

01:08:58.540 --> 01:09:00.375
What the hell are
they talking about?

01:09:00.375 --> 01:09:01.841
Jack-o!

01:09:01.841 --> 01:09:03.144
Reno!

01:09:03.144 --> 01:09:05.212
I can't believe
you guys pulled this off.

01:09:05.212 --> 01:09:08.447
After tomorrow,
Taft won't forget your name.

01:09:08.447 --> 01:09:11.415
We were just talking about
the eight touchdown passes

01:09:11.415 --> 01:09:13.417
you threw against Porterville.

01:09:13.417 --> 01:09:16.685
You don't throw eight tds
without great protection.

01:09:16.685 --> 01:09:19.017
Tomorrow, I'll need it.

01:09:20.255 --> 01:09:22.587
We're a lean,
mean fighting machine!

01:09:29.962 --> 01:09:31.656
I'm dancing.

01:10:08.256 --> 01:10:11.224
Elly, is that you?

01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:17.325
If it isn't, disregard
everything you're about to hear.

01:10:21.132 --> 01:10:26.068
You once told me to choose
between you and the game.

01:10:26.068 --> 01:10:28.003
Well...

01:10:28.003 --> 01:10:31.040
I got it wrong.

01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:35.343
Tomorrow we'll get our ass kicked.

01:10:35.343 --> 01:10:41.948
I have no right to ask
you anything at a time like this.

01:10:41.948 --> 01:10:44.583
It would be nice

01:10:44.583 --> 01:10:49.644
if you could dance with me.

01:10:56.991 --> 01:10:59.050
Those are your feet,
aren't they?

01:11:15.204 --> 01:11:17.569
Jack Aquarius.

01:12:21.685 --> 01:12:24.119
What do you want?

01:12:25.754 --> 01:12:28.484
I want you...

01:12:29.557 --> 01:12:32.024
...to kill Bakersfield.

01:12:34.094 --> 01:12:35.526
0kay.

01:14:08.762 --> 01:14:12.398
Do you do that left to right
or right to left?

01:14:12.398 --> 01:14:14.332
Both ways.
Just in case.

01:14:14.332 --> 01:14:15.559
Yeah.

01:14:17.534 --> 01:14:20.870
- You catholic?
- At the moment.

01:14:20.870 --> 01:14:22.337
Excuse me.

01:14:29.210 --> 01:14:31.040
Thank you, Jack.

01:14:34.881 --> 01:14:36.948
Jack, here we are.

01:14:36.948 --> 01:14:39.550
You finally got what you wanted.

01:14:39.550 --> 01:14:41.419
Wretched luck.

01:14:41.419 --> 01:14:44.621
Relax. You're going to be a hero.

01:14:44.621 --> 01:14:46.110
What if I'm not?

01:14:47.656 --> 01:14:49.589
It's just a game.

01:14:58.831 --> 01:15:00.423
Just a game.

01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:15.008
Kickoff time, sports fans.

01:15:15.008 --> 01:15:19.712
0utlined against the November sky,
the four horsemen ride again.

01:15:19.712 --> 01:15:23.716
They were once known as disease,
famine, pestilence, and death.

01:15:23.716 --> 01:15:25.616
We'll need luck.

01:15:25.616 --> 01:15:27.379
No such thing.

01:15:33.723 --> 01:15:39.160
End-over-end kick,
coming down to number 34.

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:41.896
He's at the 5, the 10, the 15.

01:15:41.896 --> 01:15:44.090
The quick reverse to Johnny "0"!

01:15:52.570 --> 01:15:55.093
Touchdown!
Johnny "0", Bakersfield.

01:15:59.241 --> 01:16:00.572
Had to be Johnny "0".

01:16:02.610 --> 01:16:04.878
You lucky son of a bitch!

01:16:04.878 --> 01:16:07.402
Swing it, swing it, swing it, yeah!

01:16:11.049 --> 01:16:13.380
What did that take?
Four seconds?

01:16:14.385 --> 01:16:15.646
Nail them!

01:16:16.486 --> 01:16:19.852
The kick is good.
Bakersfield 7, Taft 0.

01:16:20.322 --> 01:16:22.688
- You a Rocket or a pissant?
- I'm a Rocket

01:16:28.728 --> 01:16:31.457
God damn it!
Come back here!

01:16:40.237 --> 01:16:43.206
I don't want to
sound biased, Arturo,

01:16:43.206 --> 01:16:47.909
but that's a lean, green war machine
down there on the field.

01:16:47.909 --> 01:16:50.010
Let's see what kind
of shape you're in.

01:16:50.010 --> 01:16:52.179
Quick pitch to Luther on 1.
Ready?

01:16:52.179 --> 01:16:53.714
You a Rocket or a pissant?

01:16:53.714 --> 01:16:55.373
- I'm a Rocket!
- Show me!

01:16:57.049 --> 01:16:59.118
Set! Hut!

01:16:59.118 --> 01:17:01.347
Pitch to Luther Jackson.

01:17:02.587 --> 01:17:03.918
He's down at the 5.

01:17:07.056 --> 01:17:09.853
Same play, other side.
0n 1, Ready. Break!

01:17:10.992 --> 01:17:12.788
Set! Hut!

01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:16.926
Luther Jackson down at the 2.

01:17:19.197 --> 01:17:20.824
It's like playing my sister.

01:17:21.967 --> 01:17:24.069
3rd and 18.

01:17:24.069 --> 01:17:26.369
I love this game.

01:17:26.369 --> 01:17:29.439
Luther, split right,
run a straight fly.

01:17:29.439 --> 01:17:31.373
Jack, post pattern on 4.

01:17:31.373 --> 01:17:32.708
Be careful,
Dr. Death is covering you.

01:17:32.708 --> 01:17:35.042
- No sweat.
- I thought he was in jail.

01:17:35.042 --> 01:17:37.043
No, he's on parole.

01:17:37.043 --> 01:17:38.874
0n 4. Ready? Break!

01:17:42.282 --> 01:17:44.816
I'm going to take your teeth out.

01:17:44.816 --> 01:17:46.718
Yeah!

01:17:46.718 --> 01:17:48.652
0n 4.

01:17:48.652 --> 01:17:50.711
0pen your eyes, punk!

01:17:53.257 --> 01:17:54.358
Set!

01:17:54.358 --> 01:17:55.618
0n 4.

01:17:57.325 --> 01:17:59.594
Come on back here.
Wait for the ball.

01:17:59.594 --> 01:18:01.788
I'm open!

01:18:02.663 --> 01:18:04.358
Come on!

01:18:05.431 --> 01:18:09.467
Illegal procedure on number 99,
Jack Dundee.

01:18:09.467 --> 01:18:12.526
Great move, Jack.
You're wide open.

01:18:31.850 --> 01:18:33.750
6 points.

01:18:39.088 --> 01:18:41.291
Great start, huh, Jack?

01:18:41.291 --> 01:18:44.725
In the first quarter,
Taft 0, Bakersfield 13.

01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:48.024
Johnny "0".
Key on "0"!

01:18:50.263 --> 01:18:52.891
Look at this, guys!
Here it is!

01:18:56.467 --> 01:19:01.130
The score is Bakersfield 20,
Taft nothing.

01:19:03.907 --> 01:19:05.271
Kill somebody!

01:19:08.176 --> 01:19:09.904
Incomplete pass from Hightower.

01:19:20.751 --> 01:19:24.187
Hightower thrown for
a loss of 12 yards.

01:19:28.190 --> 01:19:29.680
Ready?

01:19:31.025 --> 01:19:32.492
Set!

01:19:46.103 --> 01:19:47.798
[Thunder]

01:19:56.777 --> 01:19:59.313
A long pass to Johnny "0"

01:19:59.313 --> 01:20:01.615
at the 30, 25, 20...

01:20:01.615 --> 01:20:03.149
Touchdown!

01:20:03.149 --> 01:20:04.883
Johnny "o" of Bakersfield.

01:20:04.883 --> 01:20:07.783
I love it!
Give me a high five!

01:20:10.053 --> 01:20:12.288
God, Morgan, my knee!

01:20:12.288 --> 01:20:14.222
God damn it!

01:20:14.222 --> 01:20:15.757
Jeez!

01:20:15.757 --> 01:20:18.026
Is there a doctor in the house?

01:20:18.026 --> 01:20:19.627
We're coming.

01:20:19.627 --> 01:20:21.495
0h, shit!

01:20:21.495 --> 01:20:22.462
Call my mom.

01:20:24.529 --> 01:20:26.429
Watch my knee.

01:20:29.134 --> 01:20:31.202
Taft 0, Bakersfield 26.

01:20:31.202 --> 01:20:32.794
[Thunder]

01:20:34.337 --> 01:20:37.840
Something's happening to
the blue-grey November sky.

01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:40.409
There seems to be some turbulence.

01:20:40.409 --> 01:20:42.968
20 seconds left
in the first half.

01:21:10.830 --> 01:21:13.732
It's half time now.

01:21:13.732 --> 01:21:16.757
It's starting to get
a bit of a Taft sprinkle.

01:21:17.769 --> 01:21:19.369
Let's get out of here.

01:21:19.369 --> 01:21:23.674
Half time statistics, rushing yardage...
Bakersfield 314 yards,

01:21:23.674 --> 01:21:25.740
Taft minus 12.

01:21:25.740 --> 01:21:27.375
The weather sucks.

01:21:27.375 --> 01:21:30.110
We have a great half-time show.

01:21:30.110 --> 01:21:33.602
Listen to that great
Rocket band.

01:21:53.529 --> 01:21:56.663
Sorry. Some great passes.
Should have had them.

01:21:56.663 --> 01:21:58.290
Forget it.

01:22:19.546 --> 01:22:22.515
Matthew 14, verse 11.

01:22:22.515 --> 01:22:27.218
"Ye shall know the truth,
and it shall make you free."

01:22:27.218 --> 01:22:28.920
Amen, coach!

01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:31.822
0n Monday morning,
they'll still be them,

01:22:31.822 --> 01:22:33.889
and we'll still be us,

01:22:33.889 --> 01:22:41.029
but for the next 30 minutes,
we can rule Kern County!

01:22:41.029 --> 01:22:42.689
Yay!

01:22:45.031 --> 01:22:48.133
Gentlemen, now!

01:22:48.133 --> 01:22:50.067
Now! Now!

01:22:51.203 --> 01:22:53.770
Now we play some football!

01:22:53.770 --> 01:22:55.101
Yay!

01:23:11.050 --> 01:23:14.313
That ought to keep them
going through the kickoff.

01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:20.822
They say a little of this stuff
warms the body and clouds the mind.

01:23:23.493 --> 01:23:25.860
That stuff runs right through you.

01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:28.462
Better go drain the weasel.

01:23:28.462 --> 01:23:32.599
Come on, Ren, have a drink.
We're on a sinking ship.

01:23:32.599 --> 01:23:35.434
The only way to do that
with dignity is to be drunk.

01:23:35.434 --> 01:23:37.869
It's easy for you, isn't it?

01:23:37.869 --> 01:23:40.972
You stunk 13 years ago,
and you stink tonight.

01:23:40.972 --> 01:23:42.939
You haven't lost
a god damn thing.

01:23:42.939 --> 01:23:46.342
This frigging nightmare
is all mine now.

01:23:46.342 --> 01:23:49.878
It's all my fault.
Have a drink.

01:23:49.878 --> 01:23:51.713
It's not your fault.

01:23:51.713 --> 01:23:54.213
0h, yes, it is.

01:23:54.213 --> 01:23:56.909
Have a god damn drink and relax!

01:24:17.497 --> 01:24:19.265
You.

01:24:19.265 --> 01:24:20.933
0h, my god!

01:24:20.933 --> 01:24:21.934
That was you.

01:24:21.934 --> 01:24:24.601
I forgot...
who put that there?

01:24:24.601 --> 01:24:27.604
- You don't think l...
- I ought to kill you!

01:24:27.604 --> 01:24:29.605
Reno, I was framed.

01:24:29.605 --> 01:24:31.505
Framed, my ass!

01:24:33.642 --> 01:24:35.802
God damn it!

01:24:37.178 --> 01:24:40.815
You started this disaster,
and you're going to finish it.

01:24:40.815 --> 01:24:44.544
You quarterback next half,
and they'll kill you.

01:24:46.051 --> 01:24:49.086
You know what will be
on your tombstone?

01:24:49.086 --> 01:24:54.323
Jack Dundee tried to remake history
and got beat 100 to nothing.

01:24:54.323 --> 01:24:56.725
They won't score
that many points.

01:24:56.725 --> 01:24:58.818
They might score 200,
but who cares?

01:25:03.997 --> 01:25:08.228
There you go.
What do you got to say now?

01:25:10.268 --> 01:25:11.969
You're right.

01:25:11.969 --> 01:25:15.638
You're not a
quarterback anymore, Reno.

01:25:15.638 --> 01:25:17.706
You're just a van specialist.

01:25:17.706 --> 01:25:21.699
I shouldn't have expected you
to lift a town out of lethargy.

01:25:23.312 --> 01:25:25.612
I was wrong to think
you were still a leader

01:25:25.612 --> 01:25:30.282
because you've lost it,
not just in football, in life.

01:25:30.282 --> 01:25:33.918
There, I've said it.
I'm sorry.

01:25:33.918 --> 01:25:35.885
Now I'm ready to die.

01:25:39.690 --> 01:25:42.291
Two minutes left to kickoff.

01:25:42.291 --> 01:25:44.726
Time for my last smoke.

01:25:44.726 --> 01:25:47.262
You lazy jive ass!

01:25:47.262 --> 01:25:50.798
You're soft, you're slow,
and your hands are for shit.

01:25:50.798 --> 01:25:53.167
Who woke you up?

01:25:53.167 --> 01:25:55.963
Get on the field and shut up.

01:25:57.736 --> 01:25:59.604
You're a prick.

01:25:59.604 --> 01:26:02.139
You always were a prick.

01:26:02.139 --> 01:26:04.766
Great, great.
Get your ass on the field.

01:26:07.276 --> 01:26:08.765
Now.

01:26:25.154 --> 01:26:26.756
When he was a prick,

01:26:26.756 --> 01:26:28.825
Reno hightower was
the greatest quarterback

01:26:28.825 --> 01:26:30.917
in the history of south
Kern County.

01:26:32.427 --> 01:26:34.395
0ne more thing, Jack.

01:26:34.395 --> 01:26:38.228
You ain't playing in the second half.
You're through.

01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:43.463
Damn you. Reno!

01:26:48.839 --> 01:26:50.340
H0ME

01:26:50.340 --> 01:26:51.307
GUESTS

01:27:07.819 --> 01:27:11.810
Whoa, nellie!
He's wearing his white shoes.

01:27:16.859 --> 01:27:18.189
My god!

01:27:22.730 --> 01:27:24.389
[Crowd chants Reno!]

01:27:28.801 --> 01:27:30.358
Unbelievable!

01:27:32.837 --> 01:27:35.633
The crowd's going wild.

01:27:42.477 --> 01:27:43.909
[Whistle blows]

01:27:53.184 --> 01:27:54.617
Let's go!

01:27:59.389 --> 01:28:01.658
0n the sidelines,
the late arrival is Jack Dundee.

01:28:01.658 --> 01:28:02.920
Right there.

01:28:13.532 --> 01:28:14.965
1st down.

01:28:17.001 --> 01:28:18.798
I'll kick your butt.

01:28:26.542 --> 01:28:28.744
Complete to Luther Jackson
at the Bakersfield 34.

01:28:28.744 --> 01:28:31.613
What the hell's happening?

01:28:31.613 --> 01:28:33.739
Let's get something moving.

01:28:34.781 --> 01:28:36.315
Great catch!

01:28:36.315 --> 01:28:39.552
That's what you're supposed to do
when the ball hits you in the hands.

01:28:39.552 --> 01:28:41.286
I want some protection
from you lazy bastards.

01:28:41.286 --> 01:28:43.220
I'm tired of picking myself
up off the ground.

01:28:43.220 --> 01:28:45.051
Play-action pass to Luther.

01:28:49.292 --> 01:28:50.460
Bring it on, chum.

01:28:50.460 --> 01:28:52.128
Let's go!

01:28:52.128 --> 01:28:53.286
Your mama.

01:29:45.599 --> 01:29:47.759
Wipe that stupid grin
off your face.

01:29:53.837 --> 01:29:56.863
Third quarter Taft 14,
Bakersfield 26.

01:30:00.076 --> 01:30:02.045
I've got hot nuts.

01:30:02.045 --> 01:30:05.410
You ain't had hot nuts
in fifty years.

01:30:23.925 --> 01:30:25.126
What's happening?

01:30:25.126 --> 01:30:26.718
7:36 left to play.

01:31:30.741 --> 01:31:32.842
Great second half, Ren.

01:31:32.842 --> 01:31:35.674
Good thing I'm not in there, huh?

01:31:38.279 --> 01:31:41.975
Did you think I'd never
find out who trashed Gigi?

01:31:42.815 --> 01:31:46.012
0nly a fool would bring that
tiger's head in the locker room.

01:31:47.252 --> 01:31:49.855
I'm a genius at making
a fool of myself.

01:31:49.855 --> 01:31:52.157
Always finding new ways to do it.

01:31:52.157 --> 01:31:54.257
I got one more for you, Jack.

01:31:54.257 --> 01:31:57.556
We get the ball back,
you're in there.

01:31:59.495 --> 01:32:01.396
Why me?

01:32:01.396 --> 01:32:03.386
Let's go, Bummer!

01:32:05.599 --> 01:32:07.800
1st and 10 at the Taft 42.

01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:09.927
1:00 left in the game.

01:32:11.035 --> 01:32:13.298
Just hold on to the ball.

01:32:15.172 --> 01:32:17.230
The ball comes loose!
It's a fumble!

01:32:19.575 --> 01:32:21.236
Who's got the ball?

01:32:30.917 --> 01:32:32.508
Who's recovered the fumble?

01:32:33.318 --> 01:32:34.784
Back off! It's our ball.

01:32:41.224 --> 01:32:45.592
Taft recovered the ball
at their own 5 yard line.

01:32:47.796 --> 01:32:49.559
Lucky bastard!

01:32:51.966 --> 01:32:53.766
Let's go, Jack!

01:32:53.766 --> 01:32:55.301
Where?

01:32:55.301 --> 01:32:57.269
All right!
Go get them, baby.

01:33:01.206 --> 01:33:02.673
0h, shit.

01:33:02.673 --> 01:33:05.708
Number 99, Jack Dundee,
is going in for Taft.

01:33:05.708 --> 01:33:07.368
Boo!

01:33:09.778 --> 01:33:13.337
Get out of bounds.
Anybody screws up, I'll kill you.

01:33:15.482 --> 01:33:17.039
Relax.

01:33:17.983 --> 01:33:20.386
Reno up to the line.

01:33:20.386 --> 01:33:23.153
Dundee flanked to the left.

01:33:23.153 --> 01:33:25.055
They let you back in the game?

01:33:25.055 --> 01:33:26.657
They've got to be kidding.

01:33:26.657 --> 01:33:29.792
Where are your glasses,
Casper the friendly ghost?

01:33:29.792 --> 01:33:31.494
You see that?

01:33:31.494 --> 01:33:33.695
0h, yeah.
Watch out.

01:33:33.695 --> 01:33:37.164
I'm pretty damn fast
for a Caucasian.

01:33:37.164 --> 01:33:38.597
Hut!

01:33:46.938 --> 01:33:49.406
And he's out of bounds at the 30.

01:33:52.842 --> 01:33:54.275
49 seconds left.

01:33:56.078 --> 01:33:57.880
I thought I broke your back.

01:33:57.880 --> 01:34:00.148
Want some more medicine?

01:34:00.148 --> 01:34:01.115
Hut!

01:34:07.986 --> 01:34:09.817
Now on the 45.

01:34:29.201 --> 01:34:32.670
Carlos down at the 50.
The clock's running.

01:34:32.670 --> 01:34:34.728
Taft has one time-out.

01:34:35.239 --> 01:34:36.807
Hurry-up offense.

01:34:36.807 --> 01:34:37.865
Let's go.

01:34:52.684 --> 01:34:54.920
Reno Hightower sacked
for a big loss.

01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:57.689
Time-out! Time!

01:34:57.689 --> 01:34:58.848
Time-out, Taft.

01:35:04.293 --> 01:35:06.962
We got time for one more.

01:35:06.962 --> 01:35:09.063
I can get open.

01:35:09.063 --> 01:35:10.797
He can't get open.

01:35:10.797 --> 01:35:12.932
I can get open.

01:35:12.932 --> 01:35:14.524
Come here, Jack.

01:35:24.774 --> 01:35:28.210
Half these people came
to watch you catch the ball.

01:35:28.210 --> 01:35:32.013
The other half came
to see you drop it.

01:35:32.013 --> 01:35:35.382
I was going to throw it to you,
but I want to win.

01:35:35.382 --> 01:35:38.840
- I'm calling someone else.
- I can get open.

01:35:40.653 --> 01:35:44.055
You drop that again,
your life is over.

01:35:44.055 --> 01:35:46.522
Just throw me the ball.

01:35:52.227 --> 01:35:54.286
Can you get open?

01:36:03.002 --> 01:36:06.505
We are Taft!
We are Taft!

01:36:06.505 --> 01:36:08.233
We are Taft!

01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:12.641
0lin, this stick is you.

01:36:12.641 --> 01:36:14.843
Eddie, you're the bottle cap.

01:36:14.843 --> 01:36:17.378
Take care of that maniac
coming from the right side.

01:36:17.378 --> 01:36:19.881
Chico, block and flare.

01:36:19.881 --> 01:36:24.116
Head for the water bucket
and cut toward the gym.

01:36:24.116 --> 01:36:26.819
Jack, give them your best move.

01:36:26.819 --> 01:36:28.513
My best move.

01:36:29.888 --> 01:36:31.089
You ready?

01:36:31.089 --> 01:36:32.189
Ready.

01:36:32.189 --> 01:36:34.088
0n 2. Ready? Break!

01:36:41.330 --> 01:36:43.364
You're not giving it
to Jack are you?

01:36:43.364 --> 01:36:45.025
You think I'm crazy?

01:36:57.475 --> 01:37:00.143
At their own 45.
No time-outs left.

01:37:00.143 --> 01:37:02.076
Five seconds left on the clock.

01:37:03.979 --> 01:37:05.981
This is it, Jack.

01:37:05.981 --> 01:37:07.538
Throw it to Jack!

01:37:09.749 --> 01:37:11.551
Last play.

01:37:11.551 --> 01:37:13.352
Ready!

01:37:13.352 --> 01:37:15.720
Death, humiliation, and pain.

01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:18.022
You ready for this, Dundee?

01:37:18.022 --> 01:37:19.223
Come and get me, sucker.

01:37:19.223 --> 01:37:20.622
Set!

01:37:21.790 --> 01:37:23.417
[Crowd quiets]

01:38:40.481 --> 01:38:42.505
Touchdown!

01:39:27.382 --> 01:39:29.083
How are your legs?

01:39:29.083 --> 01:39:30.710
My knees are killing me.

01:39:31.851 --> 01:39:33.752
They feel great.

01:39:33.752 --> 01:39:37.085
God, I love to watch you play.

01:39:54.434 --> 01:39:56.002
I did it.

01:39:56.002 --> 01:39:57.525
Nice catch.

01:39:59.038 --> 01:40:01.240
I was so lucky.

01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:04.708
No. No, you were due.

01:40:04.708 --> 01:40:06.709
Hey, Jack!

01:40:06.709 --> 01:40:09.911
I challenge you
to a rematch next year.

01:40:09.911 --> 01:40:11.479
0n astroturf.

01:40:11.479 --> 01:40:12.946
Look out!

01:40:14.215 --> 01:40:15.915
Damn it.

01:40:15.915 --> 01:40:17.439
Let's go home.

01:40:22.353 --> 01:40:25.089
How did that clown
ever catch the ball?

01:40:25.089 --> 01:40:27.091
Clown?

01:40:27.091 --> 01:40:29.626
Did you see that great move?

01:40:29.626 --> 01:40:31.616
That's my son-in-law.

01:40:32.628 --> 01:40:34.424
Hey, 99!

01:40:36.231 --> 01:40:37.789
Nice catch.
