the term "alt-right,"

But at this point,
it's not happening for me.

15:57.207 --> 15:59.584
I'm just a civil lawyer.

15:59.626 --> 16:02.587
I can't bring a case

and one of the people
who has, I think,

01:17:12.924 --> 01:17:14.926
the most serious injuries
of all the plaintiffs.

01:17:23.643 --> 01:17:25.311
And you got pepper sprayed.

01:17:25.395 --> 01:17:26.563
You got maced.

01:17:26.604 --> 01:17:27.772
You got tear-gassed.

01:17:27.814 --> 01:17:30.233
You got hands
put all over you.

01:17:42.203 --> 01:17:44.914
- I think it was incredibly
important for the jury to hear

01:17:44.956 --> 01:17:47.250
what these guys were
and how they had no problem

01:17:47.292 --> 01:17:50.962
revictimizing them
in their cross-examinations.

01:18:00.847 --> 01:18:03.933
- [whispering indistinctly]

01:18:13.109 --> 01:18:16.529
And you should do that
combined with this

01:18:16.613 --> 01:18:18.156
from Damigo to Casey.

01:18:18.239 --> 01:18:19.491
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:18:19.532 --> 01:18:21.868
- You should have a separate
section on, like, once we--

01:18:21.951 --> 01:18:23.870
- After the events
of August 11th and 12th,

01:18:23.953 --> 01:18:26.414
there's a flurry
of communications

01:18:26.498 --> 01:18:31.336
where Kessler is urging Kline
to delete the Discord.

01:18:37.133 --> 01:18:38.968
You write...

01:19:11.126 --> 01:19:14.254
- This is a private
Discord message to you

01:19:14.337 --> 01:19:15.588
from August 14th,

01:19:15.672 --> 01:19:17.507
in which this person says,

01:19:17.549 --> 01:19:20.176
"The Charlottesville server
needs to be deleted.

01:19:20.218 --> 01:19:22.846
"It's compromised
and has people talking

01:19:22.887 --> 01:19:25.515
about committing violence."

01:19:40.405 --> 01:19:43.033
In your tweet,
Mr. Kessler, you say...

01:19:59.507 --> 01:20:02.177
- It was a great success,
and we're gonna do it again.

01:20:02.260 --> 01:20:03.345
This was--

01:20:03.428 --> 01:20:06.097
- I'm finalizing the cross
for Spencer.

01:20:06.181 --> 01:20:08.224
And I need to be doing it
right now because he's likely

01:20:08.266 --> 01:20:11.269
to be called
in the next day or two.

01:20:11.353 --> 01:20:13.563
It could be sort of
any moment now.

01:20:17.776 --> 01:20:19.861
Fundamentally in this case,

01:20:19.944 --> 01:20:22.739
we need to prove that
the defendants conspired

01:20:22.781 --> 01:20:25.116
to commit
racially motivated violence.

01:20:25.158 --> 01:20:27.952
And in order to do that,
you need to elicit

01:20:27.994 --> 01:20:30.747
evidence about their views.

01:20:30.830 --> 01:20:33.750
And that can be difficult
when faced with somebody

01:20:33.792 --> 01:20:35.919
who obviously doesn't want
to admit

01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:37.921
what their actual
intentions are.

01:20:40.965 --> 01:20:42.300
- No, I don't.

01:20:42.384 --> 01:20:46.513
- Richard Spencer has tried
to put a polish

01:20:46.596 --> 01:20:50.225
on extreme hatred and racism.

01:20:52.769 --> 01:20:55.897
- I think what's
very important is to do

01:20:55.980 --> 01:20:59.567
what I can
to knock that polish off.

01:21:04.489 --> 01:21:10.829
- Yes, I have used that term
in private company

01:21:10.912 --> 01:21:12.497
in my life, yes.

01:21:12.580 --> 01:21:17.419
- My job in examining Spencer
is to let people see

01:21:17.502 --> 01:21:21.381
that he is not
who he says he is.

01:21:21.464 --> 01:21:25.677
His views are not just racist,
but they are violent,

01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:28.346
which is the key to our case.

01:21:32.517 --> 01:21:35.186
- I'm--I'm sure
I've heard him say that.

01:21:35.228 --> 01:21:37.522
But that--you know,
a lot of--you have

01:21:37.605 --> 01:21:41.985
to understand, particularly
with the younger people,

01:21:42.027 --> 01:21:44.946
some of these statements
like that

01:21:45.030 --> 01:21:47.907
are almost like
the equivalent of memes.

01:21:47.991 --> 01:21:52.620
- We knew going in
that we needed to have experts

01:21:52.704 --> 01:21:57.125
translate for the jury
the way these guys speak,

01:21:57.208 --> 01:22:00.003
what they say,
and what it really means.

01:22:00.045 --> 01:22:01.963
What we're gonna do today is,
we're gonna kind of do

01:22:02.047 --> 01:22:04.799
a walk-through of how
I see the testimony going.

01:22:04.883 --> 01:22:06.593
So that's the first section,
section one.

01:22:06.676 --> 01:22:08.178
- Okay, sounds good.

01:22:08.219 --> 01:22:10.055
- Professor Lipstadt, all--

01:22:10.138 --> 01:22:12.182
you know, do you swear to tell
the whole truth, yada yada?

01:22:12.223 --> 01:22:15.101
We're gonna put up a video
you should be able to see.

01:22:15.185 --> 01:22:17.145
Let's take a look at tab three.

01:22:23.026 --> 01:22:26.196
- Some people
are confused by the fact

01:22:26.237 --> 01:22:31.284
that anti-Semitism plays
such a part in this trial.

01:22:31.368 --> 01:22:34.037
'Cause after all, this is
a trial of white nationalists,

01:22:34.079 --> 01:22:36.206
white supremacists.

01:22:36.247 --> 01:22:39.042
So how did we get to the Jews?

01:22:39.084 --> 01:22:42.379
It's about
white replacement theory,

01:22:42.420 --> 01:22:47.550
and it is that there is
a plan afoot

01:22:47.592 --> 01:22:52.097
to destroy cultures
that are white

01:22:52.138 --> 01:22:56.976
and to flood these countries
with Black people,

01:22:57.060 --> 01:23:01.231
with brown people,
with Muslims.

01:23:01.272 --> 01:23:03.733
But the theory
also goes on to say

01:23:03.775 --> 01:23:07.570
that these people are not
as capable, as smart,

01:23:07.612 --> 01:23:10.115
as industrious as we are.

01:23:10.156 --> 01:23:14.202
So there must be someone
behind the scenes

01:23:14.285 --> 01:23:16.162
who is making this happen.

01:23:16.246 --> 01:23:19.958
It has to be someone
with the financial ability,

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.795
someone with the smarts,

01:23:23.837 --> 01:23:26.506
and someone who knows how
to operate behind the scenes

01:23:26.589 --> 01:23:28.633
and never be caught.

01:23:28.675 --> 01:23:32.303
And that is the template
for anti-Semitism.

01:23:33.555 --> 01:23:35.849
You will not replace us.
Who's the "you"?

01:23:35.932 --> 01:23:37.100
Who were they talking about?

01:23:37.142 --> 01:23:39.602
They weren't talking about
the Christian Virginians

01:23:39.644 --> 01:23:42.147
standing on the thing
thinking who these people are.

01:23:42.188 --> 01:23:43.648
Who is gonna replace them?

01:23:43.690 --> 01:23:47.152
And then they slipped into
"Jews will not replace us."

01:23:48.153 --> 01:23:50.613
It is a conspiracy theory.

01:23:50.655 --> 01:23:53.324
And essentially it is a theory
that binds together

01:23:53.408 --> 01:23:57.537
many people on the far right

01:23:57.620 --> 01:24:00.248
and sometimes
the not-so-far right.

01:24:00.331 --> 01:24:01.583
- I'm not against
the immigrants.

01:24:01.666 --> 01:24:03.168
I just am for Americans.

01:24:03.209 --> 01:24:04.294
And nobody cares about them.

01:24:04.336 --> 01:24:05.628
It's like, shut up.
You're dying.

01:24:05.670 --> 01:24:06.963
We're gonna replace you.

01:24:07.005 --> 01:24:10.800
- Democrats want to replace
you, the American voters,

01:24:10.842 --> 01:24:13.011
with newly amnestied citizens.

01:24:13.094 --> 01:24:14.763
- It's a flat-out invasion.

01:24:14.846 --> 01:24:16.389
We are being overwhelmed

01:24:16.473 --> 01:24:18.350
every day.

01:24:18.433 --> 01:24:21.394
- The white supremacists
are American citizens.

01:24:21.478 --> 01:24:26.649
The illegal immigrants are
people who shouldn't be here.

01:24:26.691 --> 01:24:31.571
- If the public can understand
that these were not just

01:24:31.654 --> 01:24:35.617
a bunch of crazies who came
to this beautiful town

01:24:35.700 --> 01:24:39.537
of Charlottesville
and did some ugly things

01:24:39.579 --> 01:24:42.248
but there was no
bigger message,

01:24:42.332 --> 01:24:46.503
what I'm saying is,
yes, there was.

01:24:46.544 --> 01:24:49.339
And yes, there is.

what will be in America

01:25:33.383 --> 01:25:37.303
