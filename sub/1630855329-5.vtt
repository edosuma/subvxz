00:13.404 --> 00:14.971
[The Croat] Previously on
Dead City...

00:15.102 --> 00:17.669
[Tommaso] It's methane.
From the sewers.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.802
[Amaia] You get your kid.
We kill the psycho.

00:19.932 --> 00:20.977
Everybody wins a prize.

00:23.240 --> 00:24.328
[Maggie] Ginny!

00:25.503 --> 00:26.243
-[fire rumbling]

00:26.374 --> 00:27.288
[Amaia] Let's go!

[walkers growling]

00:28.376 --> 00:29.290
[grunts]

00:29.420 --> 00:30.595
This way, come on!

00:30.726 --> 00:31.857
[The Croat] Negan!

00:31.988 --> 00:33.294
I know who you want.

00:34.251 --> 00:36.384
I think we bought ourselves
a little bit of time.

00:36.514 --> 00:37.428
[cocks gun]

00:37.559 --> 00:38.908
[Maggie] The sewers.

00:39.039 --> 00:39.952
We can get out
through the sewers.

00:40.083 --> 00:40.997
Let's go!

00:41.128 --> 00:42.216
[walkers growling]

00:44.348 --> 00:47.743
[water running, dripping]

00:48.918 --> 00:54.750
[whirring]

01:02.932 --> 01:04.325
These look recent.

01:04.455 --> 01:06.022
These ones are.

01:06.153 --> 01:08.981
Fresh deposits to
his methane bank.

01:09.112 --> 01:10.766
He called it feeding the beast.

01:10.896 --> 01:12.942
So this is what hotboxing
dead people looks like.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.944
Yeah, and smells like.

01:17.773 --> 01:19.688
Did anyone see
what happened to Negan?

01:19.818 --> 01:21.429
-Mm-mm.
-Nah.

01:23.561 --> 01:26.086
Who's the kid?

01:27.652 --> 01:29.611
She's with me.

01:30.960 --> 01:36.966
[unsettling music]

01:38.359 --> 01:41.753
Hey, you got a name?

01:41.884 --> 01:44.626
She don't talk much.

01:44.756 --> 01:46.584
Doesn't follow orders,
either.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.198
Thought I had
an extra flashlight.

01:51.328 --> 01:53.243
We have one. Here.

01:53.374 --> 01:55.115
Yo, yo, I got it, I got it.

01:58.378 --> 01:59.640
Here.

02:02.513 --> 02:04.820
-This is all my fault.
-[Tommaso] Hey.

02:04.950 --> 02:06.865
-I pushed us to attack them.
-Amaia, Amaia, stop.

02:06.996 --> 02:08.693
-No, I must've missed something.
-Hey.

02:08.824 --> 02:10.347
I should've thought this
through.

02:10.478 --> 02:12.567
Don't do this to
yourself, all right?

02:12.697 --> 02:16.005
The Burazi,they knew.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.660
Hey, we don't got time
to wonder how we got here.

02:18.790 --> 02:20.009
We just need to focus on

02:20.140 --> 02:23.055
getting the hell out,
all right?

02:23.186 --> 02:25.971
Yeah. I'm good.

02:27.799 --> 02:29.627
Hey, your heart starts pounding,

02:29.758 --> 02:32.848
feels like there's a jackhammer
going off in your head--

02:32.978 --> 02:34.110
Let's go.

02:34.241 --> 02:35.459
[Tommaso] --can't
keep your eyes open

02:35.590 --> 02:37.156
or you feel like
you're gonna puke,

02:37.287 --> 02:40.072
that's the methane kicking in.
That's when we start running.

02:40.203 --> 02:41.944
Just be cautious.

02:43.641 --> 02:47.471
[water running, dripping]

02:52.215 --> 02:56.350
[walker growling]

02:58.482 --> 03:10.451

[bird squawking]

04:05.636 --> 04:08.422
[walkers growling]

04:08.552 --> 04:10.380
[Negan] Your boat's sunk by now.

04:10.511 --> 04:11.512
The guy back at the arena,

04:11.642 --> 04:13.775
he's got the whole island
on lockdown.

04:16.778 --> 04:19.737
You do remember
I saved your ass back there.

04:21.086 --> 04:23.654
Whatever that was had
nothing to do with me,

04:23.785 --> 04:27.049
and everything to do
with you and your friend.

04:27.179 --> 04:29.486
He ain't my friend.

04:29.617 --> 04:31.619
Anyway,

04:31.749 --> 04:32.794
you saving me
doesn't bring back

04:32.924 --> 04:36.363
the magistrate
that you did kill,

04:36.493 --> 04:38.539
or the four other men with him.

04:38.669 --> 04:42.891
Those assholes,
they damn near killed my wife.

04:43.021 --> 04:46.851
If you had seen what she
looked like when I found her,

04:46.982 --> 04:49.463
well, I guarantee
you'd done the same.

04:51.856 --> 04:55.773
[walkers growling]

05:08.177 --> 05:09.744
Hey!

05:11.659 --> 05:13.051
Come on.

05:13.182 --> 05:15.619
[walkers growling]

05:20.320 --> 05:21.973
Come on.

05:25.499 --> 05:27.109
Out back.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.901
[water running, dripping]

05:37.032 --> 05:40.034
[group coughing]

05:44.256 --> 05:45.693
[Tommaso] Aw, shit.

05:54.658 --> 05:58.662
Yo, Amaia.
Check this out.

06:01.448 --> 06:04.015
What the hell is that?

06:05.016 --> 06:06.670
No idea.

06:12.894 --> 06:15.505
Oh, oh--
[coughs]

06:17.681 --> 06:19.422
Ugh...

06:19.553 --> 06:22.382
Oh, I think it's fat.

06:24.209 --> 06:25.515
-Ugh.
-Ginny!

06:25.646 --> 06:27.474
[fast-paced music]

06:27.604 --> 06:29.127
[Tommaso] Yo.

06:29.258 --> 06:31.086
[Maggie]
Manholes are sealed!

06:34.916 --> 06:37.135
You trying to go after Negan?
Is that it?

06:37.266 --> 06:41.618
[pants]

06:41.749 --> 06:43.751
He wanted you
to stay at the Bricks.

06:43.881 --> 06:47.145
[pants]

06:47.276 --> 06:49.974
We were so close!

06:50.105 --> 06:52.586
You don't even know him.

06:52.716 --> 06:54.544
What do you think
he's wanted for?

06:54.675 --> 06:56.981
Stealing a loaf of bread?

06:57.112 --> 06:59.027
You do not know the
monster that I know.

06:59.157 --> 07:01.421
But if you stick around
long enough, you will.

07:05.250 --> 07:06.904
Let's go.

07:18.394 --> 07:21.919
[bird squawking]

07:26.663 --> 07:28.012
You wanna tell me
where the hell we're goin',

07:28.143 --> 07:30.711
or is it just
some big-ass surprise?

07:33.409 --> 07:35.150
Chelsea Piers.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.329
Like I said,
the boats are sunk.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.549
Pier, no boats?
Don't that seem

07:42.679 --> 07:45.334
a few ass hairs
short of a dingleberry?

07:45.465 --> 07:48.337
Don't need boats.
Just the dock.

07:53.342 --> 07:54.343
It floats.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.345
All we gotta do
is disconnect it.

07:57.433 --> 07:59.783
You from here.

07:59.914 --> 08:02.830
You're a New Yorker.

08:02.960 --> 08:05.180
Bronx.

08:05.310 --> 08:07.617
Worked for the state.

08:07.748 --> 08:09.663
Drift collection boats.

08:09.793 --> 08:11.621
Scooping up debris.

08:11.752 --> 08:13.493
Keeping the rivers clean.

08:15.451 --> 08:17.279
What were you?

08:17.409 --> 08:19.499
Worked for the state too.

08:19.629 --> 08:21.283
Gym teacher.

10:33.328 --> 10:35.330

10:35.460 --> 10:39.334
Some avant-garde
artist from before?

10:39.464 --> 10:41.641
Or someone who lost
their mind from after.

10:44.339 --> 10:47.168
[walkers growling]

10:47.298 --> 10:48.909
Come on.

10:55.219 --> 11:01.965
[unsettling music]

11:05.795 --> 11:08.058
[Maggie] Amaia, where
do you think we are?

11:08.189 --> 11:10.147
Probably Hell's Kitchen

11:10.278 --> 11:12.019
or Chelsea.

11:23.726 --> 11:27.730
Holy shit!

11:27.861 --> 11:30.298
Oxygen.

11:30.428 --> 11:33.127
Must be extras for the Burazi.

11:33.257 --> 11:36.783
These ones got masks
and shit on them.

11:36.913 --> 11:39.568
Crazy lucky, right?
Now we can breathe easy.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.265
Here.

11:42.397 --> 11:45.356
-[Amaia] They work?
-Let's find out.

11:49.230 --> 11:52.581
[Tommaso breathes deeply]

11:54.235 --> 11:56.977
[Amaia] The kid gets one.
We can trade off the other.

11:58.848 --> 12:00.720
Here.

12:02.809 --> 12:05.725
What? You'd rather
keep huffin' fleshies?

12:08.510 --> 12:10.599
All right, suit yourself.

12:12.253 --> 12:18.476
[unsettling music]

12:18.607 --> 12:21.392
[Amaia] I just
can't figure it out,

12:21.523 --> 12:23.177
how they knew.

12:25.657 --> 12:27.442
Maybe it was Luther
who tipped them off.

12:29.618 --> 12:31.315
He left us.

12:31.446 --> 12:33.665
He didn't wanna go
through with any of it.

12:33.796 --> 12:35.711
-Here.
-No.

12:35.842 --> 12:37.757
No, no, no, no, no.

12:37.887 --> 12:39.889
It can't be Luther.

12:40.020 --> 12:42.762
What would he get out of it?

12:42.892 --> 12:44.589
It was him.

12:46.635 --> 12:48.898
The hell you talkin' 'bout?

12:49.029 --> 12:51.640
[Maggie] You knew exactly
how to get out last night.

12:51.771 --> 12:54.817
You knew to go to the sewers.

12:54.948 --> 12:58.125
You even knew how to get inside
with that bullshit nonno story.

12:58.255 --> 13:00.867
Bullshit? Are you--

13:00.997 --> 13:02.651
Yo, you buggin'.

13:02.782 --> 13:03.913
It's how I got off
the first time

13:04.044 --> 13:05.480
when I was being tortured?

13:07.090 --> 13:10.615
-Or he cut you a deal.
-A deal?

13:10.746 --> 13:12.356
Yo, that methane's
goin' to your head.

13:12.487 --> 13:14.010
You hearin' this?

13:14.141 --> 13:15.490
[Maggie] Had you tell him
where his hideouts were

13:15.620 --> 13:17.187
so he could raid them?
Probably gave him a signal

13:17.318 --> 13:20.364
to let him know
that we were coming.

13:20.495 --> 13:22.279
You're paranoid, you know that?

13:22.410 --> 13:24.194
You don't trust nobody.

13:24.325 --> 13:26.109
[Maggie] Why did you
take off your pack?

13:28.808 --> 13:29.983
What?

13:30.113 --> 13:31.723
Before you found
the oxygen tanks,

13:31.854 --> 13:33.987
why did you take your pack off?

13:40.123 --> 13:41.908
Do you wanna say it, or shall I?

13:48.566 --> 13:50.264
[Tommaso] Amaia.

13:50.394 --> 13:52.353
Amaia, hey, hey.

13:52.483 --> 13:54.007
Amaia, you're not gonna
believe this shit, right?

13:54.137 --> 13:55.617
You can't believe--

13:55.747 --> 13:58.707
[Maggie] He had the tanks
in his pack the whole time!

13:58.838 --> 14:01.362
I bet taking them
was the signal.

14:04.539 --> 14:07.150
[gasps] Why?

14:07.281 --> 14:09.239
'Cause he's a liar.

14:09.370 --> 14:12.373
He doesn't care about
anybody but himself.

14:12.503 --> 14:13.983
-Amaia, it was a--

14:14.114 --> 14:15.289
-It was a fantasy.

14:15.419 --> 14:18.074
Amaia, Amaia, it was a fantasy.

14:18.205 --> 14:21.469
Taking back the island?
Reclaiming our home?

14:21.599 --> 14:24.298
Our home is gone, Amaia.
It's been gone.

14:24.428 --> 14:25.690
Everyone is dead.

14:25.821 --> 14:27.779
What I did, it was the only way.

14:27.910 --> 14:33.394
-I did it for you.
-[sobbing] No, no.

14:33.524 --> 14:36.136
-[Tommaso] I had to.
-[Amaia] No.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.542
And here's the deal, all right?

19:12.673 --> 19:15.066
I help you, and no more of this

19:21.638 --> 19:23.379
You think you know me?
Is that it?

19:23.510 --> 19:27.601
