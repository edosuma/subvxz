- I'm actually a part of the fam...

12:12.144 --> 12:14.718
Doesn't need to hear
your life story, Greg.

12:14.728 --> 12:17.217
- So, uh, thanks for everything.
- No.

12:17.227 --> 12:20.050
But listen, before I do the final photo,

12:20.060 --> 12:24.050
there's a... thing I need to mention.

12:24.060 --> 12:25.561
- Cool.
- You know, just us?

12:27.769 --> 12:30.301
- Oh. Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah?

12:30.311 --> 12:32.676
- Great to meet you.
- Yeah. Thanks for understanding.

12:32.686 --> 12:35.394
- Thank you, Bill.
- You're welcome.

12:36.894 --> 12:39.801
OK. So, uh...

12:39.811 --> 12:44.050
I've turned off the Wi-Fi, and...

12:44.060 --> 12:47.175
this is, uh... this is air-gapped,

12:47.185 --> 12:52.009
so I'm gonna create
a Word document for you,

12:52.019 --> 12:54.382
and then I'm gonna print it,
because I don't want

12:54.393 --> 12:56.217
anything with my handwriting on it.

12:56.227 --> 12:57.718
I think someone has been watching

12:57.728 --> 13:01.342
a few too many spy movies
since they retired, eh, Bill?

13:01.352 --> 13:02.426
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

13:02.436 --> 13:05.342
Yeah, maybe.

13:05.352 --> 13:07.342
Ah. Here.

13:07.352 --> 13:10.092
This, uh, this is the number

13:10.102 --> 13:12.967
of a set of storage files
in the depository,

13:12.977 --> 13:15.050
and the subject is, well,

13:15.060 --> 13:17.634
something that... it's not a big deal,

13:17.644 --> 13:19.759
but it needs to be handled,

13:19.769 --> 13:21.967
and, uh... you're in the family.

13:21.977 --> 13:26.175
So... this is the name
of the legal office

13:26.185 --> 13:27.509
that is the intermediary,

13:27.519 --> 13:31.467
and this is the person outside the firm

13:31.477 --> 13:34.217
that we've been using as a firewall

13:34.227 --> 13:36.967
to deal with the blowback from the NDAs.

13:36.977 --> 13:38.551
Uh... uh-huh.

13:38.561 --> 13:41.342
It's not a big deal, Tom.

13:41.352 --> 13:43.301
Right, but what is it, Bill?

13:43.311 --> 13:44.884
Well...

13:44.894 --> 13:47.843
You... you have two viable options.

13:47.853 --> 13:51.551
I can tell you everything,
and that's fine.

13:51.561 --> 13:55.342
Or I can not tell you,
and... you wouldn't know,

13:55.352 --> 13:58.925
and then you can steer clear
of the whole death pit.

13:58.935 --> 14:00.467
And that would be fine, too.

14:00.477 --> 14:02.551
- Uh-huh.
- So, I mean,

14:02.561 --> 14:06.384
the nice news is, either way,
both ways, everything is fine.

14:06.394 --> 14:09.217
Just keep the nuclear rods cool,
nothing's gonna blow.

14:09.227 --> 14:11.718
OK, so... (LAUGHS)...
there's the death pit,

14:11.728 --> 14:14.843
and at the bottom of the death
pit there's nuclear rods?

14:14.853 --> 14:16.050
Well...

14:16.060 --> 14:18.092
You want to give me
the good news now, Bill?

14:18.102 --> 14:19.551
(CHUCKLES)

14:19.561 --> 14:21.759
- Um...
- (KNOCK ON DOOR)

14:21.769 --> 14:22.967
BILL:
Excuse me.

14:22.977 --> 14:24.509
- Photographer's ready.
- Terrific!

14:24.519 --> 14:25.519
Thanks, Kelly.

14:27.352 --> 14:28.509
And...

14:28.519 --> 14:29.546
(HITS BUTTON)

14:29.557 --> 14:30.801
print.

14:30.811 --> 14:33.967
OK, you need to tell Dad
to back the fuck off.

14:33.977 --> 14:36.634
Hey, shouldn't you be at
1 OAK or something by now?

14:36.644 --> 14:38.801
You know he rehired Frank to babysit me?

14:38.811 --> 14:41.479
I don't need a babysitter. OK?
Especially one I don't get to fuck.

14:41.490 --> 14:42.884
- Seriously?
- Yes.

14:42.894 --> 14:44.676
- Frank is back?
- Yeah. I mean, you're CEO.

14:44.686 --> 14:45.884
Can he even do that?

14:45.894 --> 14:48.050
I don't...

14:48.060 --> 14:49.301
It's... It's a question.

14:49.311 --> 14:51.593
OK, well, have a talk with
him, tell him to butt out,

14:51.603 --> 14:53.050
because we are running the show now.

14:53.060 --> 14:54.634
Tell him he needs to go back to bed

14:54.644 --> 14:56.259
and eat some soup, get some rest.

14:56.269 --> 14:57.843
Look, relax, OK?

14:57.853 --> 14:59.676
The, uh, you know,

14:59.686 --> 15:03.134
the dinosaur is having
one last roar at the meteor

15:03.144 --> 15:05.175
before it wipes him out. But look,

15:05.185 --> 15:07.801
hey... you're doing a great job.

15:07.811 --> 15:09.884
Thank you. Thanks, man.

15:09.894 --> 15:11.967
- (KISSES)
- (ROARS)

15:11.977 --> 15:15.551
It's actually good to hear.
It's a big job.

15:15.561 --> 15:17.759
I know it, bro. Tell me about it.

15:17.769 --> 15:19.759
Do you want some help? I can help you,

15:19.769 --> 15:22.509
we can tag-team it on Dad's
speech at Sad Sack Wasp Trap.

15:22.519 --> 15:25.175
Um, I guess, yeah,

15:25.185 --> 15:27.426
I mean, it is a CEO thing,

15:27.436 --> 15:31.301
so, I mean, like I have
a whole thing prepared

15:31.311 --> 15:33.967
- with jokes, and so...
- You're doing jokes?

15:33.977 --> 15:36.092
Why does everyone keep saying that?
I'm funny.

15:36.102 --> 15:38.551
(LAUGHING) Yup.
I'm sure you're gonna kill it.

15:38.561 --> 15:41.426
- Who you taking?
- Uh, no one. Rava's busy.

15:41.436 --> 15:44.217
- Doesn't want to? Got it.
- So maybe I'll roll solo.

15:44.227 --> 15:47.481
How's that gonna look? CEO can't even
get an ugly sister to go to the ball?

15:47.492 --> 15:50.551
- You know who I'd like to take?
- Hmm?

15:50.561 --> 15:52.925
Anna Newman. That blonde chick from ATN?

15:52.935 --> 15:55.551
The bl... Oh, shit, yeah!
I'd fuck that in a minute.

15:55.561 --> 15:58.301
- Take her.
- It's not cool. I'm her boss.

15:58.311 --> 16:01.884
Oh, come on, what a pathetic beta-cuck.

16:01.894 --> 16:04.175
"Uh, excuse me, uh, would it be cool,

16:04.185 --> 16:06.467
'cause I have something
very secret in my pants.

16:06.477 --> 16:09.020
Would it be OK to show, please?
Or is that a trigger warning?"

16:09.031 --> 16:11.134
Jesus, Roman, you're
a walking fuckin' lawsuit.

16:11.144 --> 16:13.301
Uh, no, I'm honest, I'm just like,

16:13.311 --> 16:16.134
"Hey, I like your face.
I wanna fuck your face.

16:16.144 --> 16:17.467
Can I cum on your face?"

16:17.477 --> 16:19.967
Which is why my face
is drowning in pussy

16:19.977 --> 16:21.811
and you're not even fucking your wife.

16:22.977 --> 16:27.259
Too far. Eeh! Sorry, it just...

16:27.269 --> 16:28.811
Ooh, them's the facts.

16:37.060 --> 16:38.967
- (BANGING ON DOOR)
- No, thank you!

16:38.977 --> 16:41.227
Please leave me alone, please!
Thank you!

16:45.769 --> 16:47.509
LOGAN:
I... I got it.

16:47.519 --> 16:48.718
Morning.

16:48.728 --> 16:50.967
Morning.

16:50.977 --> 16:53.217
(MUTTERS)

16:53.227 --> 16:55.884
OK. Give me a hand. Yeah.

16:55.894 --> 16:59.134
Uh, personal first,

16:59.144 --> 17:01.718
then the corporal.

17:01.728 --> 17:03.342
Corporate.

17:03.352 --> 17:06.009
Um, OK.

17:06.019 --> 17:08.759
Well, personal, nothing much.

17:08.769 --> 17:10.342
Pre-ball piece,

17:10.352 --> 17:12.509
profiles of endowment recipients,

17:12.519 --> 17:14.134
that's all great,

17:14.144 --> 17:16.175
and just a little piece on your health,

17:16.185 --> 17:18.675
but I don't think you need to hear that.

17:18.685 --> 17:19.769
Say it.

17:23.728 --> 17:27.467
Um, "Kendall Roy will give
the traditional address

17:27.477 --> 17:29.676
at the RECNY charity ball tonight,

17:29.686 --> 17:32.259
in a sign that even after
recovery from his stroke,

17:32.269 --> 17:36.686
Logan Roy is intending to wind
down from public duties."

17:38.561 --> 17:41.925
Where did he get that?
Who gave him that?

17:41.935 --> 17:45.217
- I... I don't know.
- Well, here's an idea: find out.

17:45.227 --> 17:49.394
Or find some other prick to pay
ya a million a fuckin' year.

17:52.019 --> 17:53.185
OK.

17:56.977 --> 17:58.436
(MUTTERS)

18:00.603 --> 18:02.676
CONNOR: I just gotta tell
you, handling the ball,

18:02.686 --> 18:04.050
it's just not a big deal for me,

18:04.060 --> 18:05.634
which is the thing that's so nice.

18:05.644 --> 18:08.259
- It is not a big deal.
- "Winding down."

18:08.269 --> 18:10.884
Winding fucking down. I'm winding up.

18:10.894 --> 18:13.593
It's just funny, being in charge.

18:13.603 --> 18:15.634
I remember years ago

18:15.644 --> 18:17.509
I'd be at the table between you and Mom

18:17.519 --> 18:20.801
and we'd look down,
and there'd be the mayor,

18:20.811 --> 18:23.551
and all the names of old New York,

18:23.561 --> 18:25.884
and you'd whisper in my ear, you'd say,

18:25.894 --> 18:29.593
"That Astor used to be that,
and he ran this

18:29.603 --> 18:31.593
till he SNAFUed that,

18:31.603 --> 18:35.634
and he's porking her, and she's a slut."

18:35.644 --> 18:40.593
And it was just... a very lovely time.

18:40.603 --> 18:42.134
Yeah.

18:42.144 --> 18:44.593
Your mom loved all that.

18:44.603 --> 18:47.301
- (CONNOR CHUCKLING)
- Fuckin' Wasp Trap.

18:47.311 --> 18:49.301
(BOTH LAUGHING)

18:49.311 --> 18:51.971
What would you think about me taking
over a little on the foundation?

18:51.982 --> 18:54.467
Could we pivot it away from sick
kids and contemporary dance

18:54.477 --> 18:56.384
and toward tax reform?

18:56.394 --> 18:58.551
- Huh?
- To be frank, everyone's dancing anyway,

18:58.561 --> 19:00.217
and there are a lot of charities

19:00.227 --> 19:02.634
that cater to sad sacks...
God knows I love 'em,

19:02.644 --> 19:05.676
but hey, what about lending a hand
to stimulate free enterprise?

19:05.686 --> 19:09.185
Yeah, well, let's...
let's see how tonight goes, huh?

19:10.603 --> 19:12.925
Yeah.

19:12.935 --> 19:14.977
EVA: I don't have time
for this shit.

19:19.519 --> 19:21.134
- Hey.
- EVA: Hi.

19:21.144 --> 19:24.759
Uh, so... look,

19:24.769 --> 19:27.467
I want you to call off your dogs.

19:27.477 --> 19:29.676
Mm-hmm.

19:29.686 --> 19:31.801
Because this obsession with Joyce,

19:31.811 --> 19:33.342
it's... it's out of line.

19:33.352 --> 19:36.634
It's sitting very high
on your half hour.

19:36.644 --> 19:38.477
Uh-huh.

19:39.728 --> 19:42.217
And it's vindictive.

19:42.227 --> 19:44.519
And actually, it's bad for democracy.

19:49.935 --> 19:51.759
Are you going to respond?

19:51.769 --> 19:54.301
Well, I think it's important to remember

19:54.311 --> 19:57.467
that I'm not the one taking
pictures of my asshole here.

19:57.477 --> 19:59.843
(FORCED LAUGHTER)

19:59.853 --> 20:01.843
Yeah.

20:01.853 --> 20:04.634
Are you running this because you
think my dad likes this shit?

20:04.644 --> 20:08.060
Oh, he wouldn't put that kind
of pressure on his people.

20:09.603 --> 20:11.217
OK.

20:11.227 --> 20:14.175
Look, if I could get some nasty
little tidbits on some other folk,

20:14.185 --> 20:15.634
could you ramp this down?

20:15.644 --> 20:17.718
We're not the only ones
running it, Shiv.

20:17.728 --> 20:19.467
It's a hugely popular story.

20:19.477 --> 20:21.718
Yeah, but you're leading it, Eva.

20:21.728 --> 20:24.551
You had a ten-minute "sexpert" segment

20:24.561 --> 20:26.217
on "How to keep your man happy in bed,"

20:26.227 --> 20:27.509
on a news channel.

20:27.519 --> 20:29.884
OK, you've said your piece, so...

20:29.894 --> 20:31.426
and I've listened.

20:31.436 --> 20:33.394
- Great.
- Great.

20:34.811 --> 20:36.259
Actually, no. You know what?

20:36.269 --> 20:39.301
I'm saying as her strategist,
this level of attack

20:39.311 --> 20:41.634
begins to reflect on
your professional judgement.

20:41.644 --> 20:44.718
And you need to think about
the future, because this...

20:44.728 --> 20:46.342
this is the old world,

20:46.352 --> 20:48.759
and someday, in this world,
things will change.

20:48.769 --> 20:51.509
You know I wouldn't let any other
strategist in the building,

20:51.519 --> 20:52.925
let alone this floor.

20:52.935 --> 20:54.843
Well, I am very grateful.

20:54.853 --> 20:56.701
So when we're talking
professional judgement,

20:56.712 --> 20:58.967
good to bear in mind
that you're only here

20:58.977 --> 21:02.436
because your name matches the
one carved on the building.

21:07.519 --> 21:08.925
KENDALL:
OK, last thing.

21:08.935 --> 21:10.426
For the press and comms,

21:10.436 --> 21:12.354
it's clear, right, that I'm CEO.

21:12.365 --> 21:14.580
We hope one day my dad will
be back, we don't know when.

21:14.591 --> 21:16.591
- FRANK: Great. Thank you.
- Thanks, guys.

21:19.477 --> 21:21.759
JESS: Hey, Kendall.
Stewy's here.

21:21.769 --> 21:23.092
I just put him in the South Tank

21:23.102 --> 21:24.935
in case you want to keep it on the DL.

21:26.352 --> 21:28.801
Hey, Kendall. Can I grab five?

21:28.811 --> 21:30.050
Uh-huh.

21:30.060 --> 21:33.134
TOM: Um, there's
something, uh,

21:33.144 --> 21:35.259
something that you don't know about,

21:35.269 --> 21:38.144
and maybe it's probably something
that you don't want to know about.

21:40.519 --> 21:42.092
And, uh...

21:42.102 --> 21:44.301
You know what my dad always said?

21:44.311 --> 21:46.759
He'd say he loved all his employees,

21:46.769 --> 21:50.676
but he particularly loved the guys who ate
the shit for him and he never even knew it.

21:50.686 --> 21:52.634
Got it.

21:52.644 --> 21:55.467
Got it. Excuse me while I get
myself a knife and a fork

21:55.477 --> 21:57.102
and some Hollandaise.

22:03.227 --> 22:06.134
- Hey!
- Hey, bro.

22:06.144 --> 22:08.175
How's it goin'?

22:08.185 --> 22:10.467
- Good. What's up?
- So your dad's in?

22:10.477 --> 22:11.759
Yup, he made it in.

22:11.769 --> 22:13.925
Which we were all, uh, delighted about.

22:13.935 --> 22:15.884
- You were delighted about?
- Sure.

22:15.894 --> 22:18.134
Sure. What's the story?

22:18.144 --> 22:19.426
No, he's great, you know,

22:19.436 --> 22:21.134
he likes to remind us he's still alive.

22:21.144 --> 22:25.175
It's great to get his take,
but he needs a lot of rest.

22:25.185 --> 22:28.718
- Dad. Hey. Just talkin' about you.
- Sir Roy. Logan.

22:28.728 --> 22:31.342
It's just great to see you.
How have you been?

22:31.352 --> 22:35.634
So, you're the little schmuck
who owns such a big chunk of me.

22:35.644 --> 22:39.342
Dad, it's Stewy. You guys have
met like a million times.

22:39.352 --> 22:41.217
Excuse me barging in,

22:41.227 --> 22:44.009
it's just Gerri told me I have
a meeting with Opalite later...

22:44.019 --> 22:47.718
just to say, "I like it. Buy it."

22:47.728 --> 22:49.925
- OK, Ken?
- OK, good thought.

22:49.935 --> 22:53.384
Uh, I'll come find you
and we can discuss.

22:53.394 --> 22:56.551
Sure, but if I don't see you, I want it.

22:56.561 --> 22:58.925
OK, uh... (LAUGHS)...

22:58.935 --> 23:02.259
Well, it's not necessarily
the best option in the sector,

23:02.269 --> 23:05.925
so, uh, so, yeah, but we can, uh...

23:05.935 --> 23:09.467
I want us into data mining. Buy it.

23:09.477 --> 23:11.384
It's a really flooded sector, OK?

23:11.394 --> 23:13.467
Lotta hustlers, lots of bullshit.

23:13.477 --> 23:14.884
You know, it's a gold rush.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.426
Oh, yeah.

23:16.436 --> 23:19.217
And who wants gold?

23:19.227 --> 23:21.925
Make them an offer
they get excited about.

23:21.935 --> 23:25.718
Make them an offer they want to
tell their wives about at night.

23:25.728 --> 23:27.593
Nice outdated sexism, Dad,

23:27.603 --> 23:30.217
but I'm sure you're
all over the data mining.

23:30.227 --> 23:31.519
Hmm.

23:32.644 --> 23:34.935
(MUMBLES)

23:37.477 --> 23:38.512
I'm sorry?

23:38.523 --> 23:40.967
You OK? Dad?

23:40.977 --> 23:44.426
Hey, should I get... someone?

23:44.436 --> 23:47.009
Maybe you should go home. Yeah?

23:47.019 --> 23:50.603
I just, uh... need to piss.

23:53.977 --> 23:55.925
OK. (CHUCKLES)

23:55.935 --> 23:59.884
Great. Well, thanks for
sharing, uh, old guy.

23:59.894 --> 24:02.301
- Glad he's gonna go piss.
- Uh, sorry. You know.

24:02.311 --> 24:03.801
- He's still recovering.
- Mm-hmm.

24:03.811 --> 24:05.676
Listen, just technically,

24:05.686 --> 24:09.634
and I don't want
to sound reductive, Ken,

24:09.644 --> 24:13.092
but... who's in charge right now?

24:13.102 --> 24:15.884
Me. I am.

24:15.894 --> 24:18.311
Legally and effectively.

24:44.561 --> 24:46.686
(UNZIPPING)

24:49.686 --> 24:52.019
(URINATING)

24:53.477 --> 24:55.551
OK, Rick, thanks for that.

24:55.561 --> 24:56.811
Thank you.

24:56.935 --> 24:58.311
Very useful. Thanks.

25:04.352 --> 25:06.644
(WHISPERS) Fuck off.

25:16.285 --> 25:17.294
Hey.

25:27.185 --> 25:28.925
(TOM EXHALES)

25:28.935 --> 25:33.134
So, Greg, uh... listen.

25:33.144 --> 25:36.342
I just had a meeting
with my private attorney,

25:36.352 --> 25:39.759
and, uh...

25:39.769 --> 25:42.227
it seems I have been exposed to a virus.

25:43.686 --> 25:45.384
Oh. Right.

25:45.394 --> 25:47.593
Yeah.

25:47.603 --> 25:48.935
Sit down.

25:51.728 --> 25:54.217
It's a deadly virus.

25:54.227 --> 25:55.925
And, uh...

25:55.935 --> 26:00.728
(LAUGHING) and now... now I'm fucked!

26:03.227 --> 26:05.060
Forever.

26:06.728 --> 26:08.718
- It sounds bad.
- It is bad.

26:08.728 --> 26:11.884
It is. And, uh,
I kind of need to share it.

26:11.894 --> 26:15.227
But anyone I talk to, uh...

26:17.644 --> 26:20.603
anyone I talk to, I effectively kill.

26:22.102 --> 26:23.144
Here.

26:25.102 --> 26:27.801
That's the death pit, Greg.

26:27.811 --> 26:28.894
Take a look.

26:31.060 --> 26:34.477
I... I mean, I feel like I might
not like it in the death pit.

26:36.561 --> 26:37.811
Go ahead.

26:40.686 --> 26:42.551
You're family.

26:42.561 --> 26:44.436
Thank you.

26:50.436 --> 26:54.009
- It's complicated.
- Kind of, yeah. But not really.

26:54.019 --> 26:56.551
For a number of years there was
an unofficial company policy

26:56.561 --> 26:59.509
on the cruise lines that if there
was a serious criminal incident

26:59.519 --> 27:02.050
we would, if possible, sail, not home,

27:02.060 --> 27:04.676
but to a Caribbean
or South American port

27:04.686 --> 27:06.884
where there were so-called
"friendly" authorities,

27:06.894 --> 27:09.175
and we could minimize the
incident to avoid negative PR.

27:09.185 --> 27:12.009
- Incidents like...
- Theft. Sexual assault.

27:12.019 --> 27:13.884
Rape. Murder.

27:13.894 --> 27:15.884
OK. The bad ones.

27:15.894 --> 27:17.801
Yeah. There's hundreds in there.

27:17.811 --> 27:20.676
You know, the head of cruises
himself, Lester,

27:20.686 --> 27:23.301
would go on these entertainment tours,

27:23.311 --> 27:25.467
meeting the dancers,

27:25.477 --> 27:29.551
and extending the contracts of the
ones that would suck him off.

27:29.561 --> 27:32.634
Everyone we could, we
paid off, we hushed up.

27:32.644 --> 27:36.426
But there are emails, there's
correspondence... it's ready to blow.

27:36.436 --> 27:38.342
It's a fucking time bomb.

27:38.352 --> 27:40.217
So, what are you...
what are you gonna do?

27:40.227 --> 27:41.925
I don't know! I don't know!

27:41.935 --> 27:44.175
Because anyone I ask for
advice, I make complicit.

27:44.185 --> 27:47.342
If you know about this stuff,
you should tell.

27:47.352 --> 27:50.134
But you can't, because you're
gonna spread the virus.

27:50.144 --> 27:52.759
So...

27:52.769 --> 27:55.509
I have the virus, don't I?

27:55.519 --> 27:58.009
OK, Ken, uh...

27:58.019 --> 28:00.894
why don't you grab the Opalite material?

28:02.311 --> 28:04.801
Uh, well, as I explained, Dad,

28:04.811 --> 28:08.676
I think they're kind of
snake oil salesmen, you know?

28:08.686 --> 28:11.551
Like they're the people
who you buy a refrigerator

28:11.561 --> 28:13.676
and their algorithm
is sending you, like,

28:13.686 --> 28:16.634
30 ads for more fridges. Great algo.

28:16.644 --> 28:19.259
Well, you're the business genius
who sold me out

28:19.269 --> 28:20.925
to this fucker,

28:20.935 --> 28:22.718
so I'd like to hear Stewart's thoughts.

28:22.728 --> 28:24.426
OK, I'll get Jess to...

28:24.436 --> 28:27.269
It's a 30-fuckin'-second walkaway, son.

28:32.811 --> 28:34.269
KENDALL: Sure.

28:36.769 --> 28:38.185
So, Stewart...

28:48.227 --> 28:49.384
Jess.

28:49.394 --> 28:50.426
Hey, Jess?

28:50.436 --> 28:51.509
Yeah?

28:51.519 --> 28:53.175
Has anyone been...

28:53.185 --> 28:54.894
Uh, your dad came in
for like two minutes.

29:25.269 --> 29:26.394
What the...

29:27.436 --> 29:29.102
(SNIFFS) Oh, Jesus, fuck.

29:42.019 --> 29:44.134
- STEWY: Just like gone in...
- (LOGAN LAUGHING)

29:44.144 --> 29:46.551
Hey. (CLEARS THROAT)

29:46.561 --> 29:49.843
So, I think we're buyin'.

29:49.853 --> 29:51.801
Good with you, Stewart?

29:51.811 --> 29:53.603
You're the boss.

29:56.102 --> 29:57.644
All good?

30:01.185 --> 30:04.884
Stewart, are you goin' to
the Sad Sack Wasp Trap tonight?

30:04.894 --> 30:07.843
- The...
- He means the RECNY ball.

30:07.853 --> 30:10.884
Oh. Yes. I am. I'm sorry to hear
that you're not gonna make it.

30:10.894 --> 30:12.801
Oh, no, no, I'll be there.

30:12.811 --> 30:15.134
Well, I'm payin' for the fuckin' thing,

30:15.144 --> 30:16.925
so I might as well go.

30:16.935 --> 30:18.477
(LAUGHS) Yeah.

30:19.977 --> 30:21.759
You sure it was him?

30:21.769 --> 30:24.050
You think a lot of people
come in here and take a piss?

30:24.060 --> 30:25.925
GERRI: Maybe someone
spilled something.

30:25.935 --> 30:28.634
Yeah, maybe the massive
fucking ice sculpture

30:28.644 --> 30:30.759
I forgot about melted. It's urine.

30:30.769 --> 30:32.843
ROMAN: This isn't
a false flag, is it?

30:32.853 --> 30:35.175
Did you piss on your own floor?

30:35.185 --> 30:38.676
Why are you looking like that?
What... What if people knew?

30:38.686 --> 30:41.967
- Gerri, you gotta talk to him.
- What do you want me to say?

30:41.977 --> 30:44.925
Well, first tell him where
to go pee-pee and poo-poo.

30:44.935 --> 30:46.646
He came in, he was talking to Stewy.

30:46.657 --> 30:48.759
What's he gonna do next,
start jizzing in my coffee?

30:48.769 --> 30:50.509
Take a dump on my iPad?

30:50.519 --> 30:51.884
He's still in recovery mode.

30:51.894 --> 30:53.384
If he thinks he's OK to come back,

30:53.394 --> 30:54.967
he should talk to you, Gerri,

30:54.977 --> 30:57.342
and the nominating committee,
and set a date. Right?

30:57.352 --> 31:00.259
Well, technically, but it's
kind of a gray area because...

31:00.269 --> 31:02.843
- He says he's coming tonight.
- ROMAN: You're kidding.

31:02.853 --> 31:04.884
OK, well, that's a concern,
because obviously

31:04.894 --> 31:07.050
with major investors and press on hand..

31:07.060 --> 31:10.009
KENDALL: Yeah, I know.
What if he freaks out?

31:10.019 --> 31:12.050
What if he falls asleep in his soup?

31:12.060 --> 31:14.134
What if he starts
shouting racist comments?

31:14.144 --> 31:16.092
Just another Saturday night, baby.

31:16.102 --> 31:19.467
We have a fiduciary duty not to
let the company look, uh, nuts.

31:19.477 --> 31:21.801
What did you do, Kendall, when
you realized he'd done this?

31:21.811 --> 31:25.884
- What did I do?
- Yeah. How did you respond?

31:25.894 --> 31:28.634
I... I don't know, I didn't
want to humiliate him.

31:28.644 --> 31:30.728
- GERRI: Hmm.
- KENDALL: What?

31:36.394 --> 31:39.759
This would be the third injection
I've given you in a month.

31:39.769 --> 31:41.843
He feels he needs to be there.

31:41.853 --> 31:44.092
You're only meant
to have three in a year.

31:44.102 --> 31:45.718
No wonder you're not sleeping.

31:45.728 --> 31:48.551
You're risking long-term nerve damage.

31:48.561 --> 31:52.092

31:52.102 --> 31:54.394

32:00.686 --> 32:03.259
- Yeah?
- So, look, I don't...

32:03.269 --> 32:06.175
I don't wanna get you
into this, but, um,

32:06.185 --> 32:09.217
well, Bill told me,
as part of the handover,

32:09.227 --> 32:11.843
- where some of the bodies were buried.
- Mm-hmm?

32:11.853 --> 32:14.676
And, uh, they're not
very well-buried bodies,

32:14.686 --> 32:17.259
and they're not really
even bodies, they're...

32:17.269 --> 32:19.384
- kind of zombies?
- (SHIV LAUGHS)

32:19.394 --> 32:23.259
They're ready to rise up
from the dead at any moment

32:23.269 --> 32:25.217
- and kill me.
- Uh-huh?

32:25.227 --> 32:28.175
I'm worried that if...
if it does come out,

32:28.185 --> 32:30.759
and it's sort of... it's
kind of bound to come out,

32:30.769 --> 32:32.925
and it's while I'm in charge, I'm dead,

32:32.935 --> 32:35.009
because I know,
and I'm not doing anything.

32:35.019 --> 32:37.884
But if I do do something, I've
gotta, you know, do something.

32:37.894 --> 32:40.884
- Right.
- And I'd like to,

32:40.894 --> 32:43.134
you know, not...
obviously not carry the can,

32:43.144 --> 32:45.134
but maybe do the right thing.

32:45.144 --> 32:46.593
OK.

32:46.603 --> 32:48.426
And what is the right thing?

32:48.436 --> 32:50.050
Well, what I'm thinking...

32:50.060 --> 32:51.843
is a press conference.

32:51.853 --> 32:54.050
- Oh? OK.
- Yeah. And tell...

32:54.060 --> 32:57.301
Get everybody in, tell all the
top execs and the law guys,

32:57.311 --> 32:59.050
and we go public.

33:07.477 --> 33:09.301

33:09.311 --> 33:11.175

- Well, that sounds brave.

- Yes. Right. Is that good?

Yeah?

33:21.185 --> 33:22.843
Look, I did what I can.

33:22.853 --> 33:24.342
It's dropping down the running order.

33:24.352 --> 33:26.759
But long-term, you gotta ask yourself,

33:26.769 --> 33:28.676
will your husband's dirty pink asshole

33:28.686 --> 33:32.301
go nicely with that lovely white

35:20.603 --> 35:23.175
The room is growing lopsided.

35:23.185 --> 35:25.801
- Let's lead them.
- What?

35:25.811 --> 35:28.134
Like sheep, Willa,
let's lead them like sheep.

35:28.144 --> 35:30.925
Go around this way and corral them.
Corral them this way, OK?

35:30.935 --> 35:32.967
- I'm gonna go this way.
- OK. OK.

35:32.977 --> 35:34.718
(CLAPS HANDS) Hello! Everyone!

35:34.728 --> 35:36.925
- Everyone! Hi!
- Come on, everybody,

35:36.935 --> 35:39.301
I'm sorry to interrupt,
you all look fabulous,

35:39.311 --> 35:42.010
I just want to say if you're having
trouble getting a drink over there,

35:42.021 --> 35:43.551
identical bar over here...

35:43.561 --> 35:45.426
If you could just go to this side.

35:45.436 --> 35:47.877
Enjoy the space, there's acres of it.
So have a good time.

35:47.888 --> 35:49.801
The signature cocktail? Too avant-garde.

35:49.811 --> 35:51.551
The servers are creating bottlenecks.

35:51.561 --> 35:53.634
They put pesto in the gin...
it's a disaster.

35:53.644 --> 35:54.942
There's no flow, Stephanie.

35:54.953 --> 35:57.009
The evening is congealing...
there is no flow. OK?

35:57.019 --> 36:00.967
Mark Morris,
yeah, so my dad's first wife

36:00.977 --> 36:03.301
thought she was gonna,
you know, empty the ghettos

36:03.311 --> 36:06.676
and get everyone into ballet
when they started this thing.

36:06.686 --> 36:08.718
- Yeah.
- So patronizing.

36:08.728 --> 36:10.509
What are you drinking?

36:10.519 --> 36:13.009
Uh, a white wine.

36:13.019 --> 36:14.384
Can we get a white wine?

36:14.394 --> 36:16.676

into New York City Ballet

36:16.686 --> 36:18.967

36:18.977 --> 36:21.009
because that's nice or whatever.

36:21.019 --> 36:23.134
No, it's nice.

36:23.144 --> 36:24.925
Yeah. It's, uh...

36:24.935 --> 36:27.676
it's dumb, but it's cool.

36:27.686 --> 36:29.227
Can I have a bitters and soda?

36:31.644 --> 36:34.175
I'm actually kind of nervous
about the speech.

36:34.185 --> 36:35.967
- Are you?
- Yeah.

36:35.977 --> 36:38.843
Maybe you can, uh,
give me some pointers.

36:38.853 --> 36:42.644
- You're the ATN pro, actually.
- (ANNA LAUGHS)

36:44.352 --> 36:45.811
Good, good.

36:45.935 --> 36:47.967
Is that too wry?

36:47.977 --> 36:50.967
About our good works?
Is that, like, snitty?

36:50.977 --> 36:53.509
Uh, well, there's all this,

36:53.519 --> 36:55.551
like, three pages of, you know,

36:55.561 --> 36:58.426
about you and the family, and the
good works, and the big hearts,

36:58.436 --> 37:00.551
and on and on and on.

37:07.686 --> 37:09.384

37:09.394 --> 37:10.551
Hold on, pal. What is this?

Roll that back. What is that?

37:12.603 --> 37:14.467
What?

37:14.477 --> 37:17.217
- "Surprise Logan retirement announcement."
- Uh, yeah.

37:17.227 --> 37:19.394
That came through late.
He said he'd just wing it.

Where are you sitting, man?

37:31.102 --> 37:32.509

- In the basement?

37:32.519 --> 37:34.175
Out by the dumpsters?

37:34.185 --> 37:36.092
Maybe you... do you want to trade?

37:36.102 --> 37:37.551
Maybe you'll meet a wealthy widow

37:37.561 --> 37:39.634
and you can seduce her
with your sad eyes.

37:39.644 --> 37:42.175
She can keep you as a pet

- As do you.

37:47.269 --> 37:49.426
Thank you. So, Tom,

37:49.436 --> 37:50.676
I hear you're thinking about

37:50.686 --> 37:52.603
holding a little press conference?

37:54.185 --> 37:56.769
- You know about that?
- I don't know anything.

37:59.393 --> 38:02.523
- Right. I just think it's the best thing
to do... - Tom, you need to shut up.

38:02.534 --> 38:04.858
This isn't the time to get
your conscience out and shout,

38:04.869 --> 38:06.718
"Hey, look at me! I cannot tell a lie!

38:06.728 --> 38:08.759
I'm a good little boy,
look at my ding-dong."

38:08.769 --> 38:11.925
OK, I don't think that's a fair
characterization of what I'm...

38:11.935 --> 38:13.801
Have you ever heard
of the Sin Cake Eater?

38:13.811 --> 38:16.676
- No.
- He would come to the funeral

38:16.686 --> 38:20.467
and he would eat all the little cakes
they laid out on the corpse...

38:20.477 --> 38:22.551
he ate up all the sins.

38:22.561 --> 38:25.259
And you know what? The Sin
Cake Eater was very well paid.

38:25.269 --> 38:28.801
And so long as there was another
one who came along after he died,

38:28.811 --> 38:30.593
it all worked out.

38:30.603 --> 38:33.217
So, this may not be the best situation,

38:33.227 --> 38:36.676
but there are harder jobs,
and you get a fuckload of cake.

38:36.686 --> 38:39.884
Can I ask you where
you heard about this, please?

38:39.894 --> 38:43.801
Tom, it's tough to have
to tell you like this,

38:43.811 --> 38:46.467
but I'm in a sexual
relationship with your mother.

38:46.477 --> 38:48.603

to check in on something.

aware of Kendall announcing

39:08.102 --> 39:10.092
your retirement this evening?

39:10.102 --> 39:11.467
I mean, I'm sure you were,

39:11.477 --> 39:12.925
but I just wanted to triple-check.

39:12.935 --> 39:16.551
- What?
- Yeah. Is that right?

39:16.561 --> 39:18.175
- No.
- No?

39:18.185 --> 39:20.175
Is it a mistake? Because
Kendall's gonna say it.

39:20.185 --> 39:21.519
It's on the teleprompter.

39:23.853 --> 39:25.853

45:34.394 --> 45:36.593
if he fucks up publicly,

45:36.603 --> 45:38.342
we have a major problem.

45:38.352 --> 45:40.603
- Right.
- You need to talk to him.

45:43.728 --> 45:46.227
- OK. Got it.
- OK? OK.

45:52.561 --> 45:55.925
Lasagna? Did you know
they had some lasagna?

45:55.935 --> 45:58.603
- Would you like some?
- Oh, yeah. (MUMBLES)

45:59.894 --> 46:01.092
- Hey.
- Hmm.

46:01.102 --> 46:03.801
- You good?
- I'm good.

46:03.811 --> 46:04.935
Great.

46:10.519 --> 46:12.217
Good luck tonight.

46:12.227 --> 46:14.134
Gonna knock it out of the park.

46:14.144 --> 46:15.269
Thank you.

46:24.185 --> 46:25.561
CONNOR:
Good luck.

46:26.935 --> 46:29.384
Bon chance. (CHUCKLES)

46:29.394 --> 46:30.925
Best foot forward.

46:30.935 --> 46:32.009
You can do it.

46:32.019 --> 46:35.217
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

46:35.227 --> 46:37.634
- Nervous?
- Not too bad.

46:37.644 --> 46:40.811
I had a thing with the butter,
but... seems to be OK.

46:42.477 --> 46:44.467
- Where you from?
- Bushwick.

46:44.477 --> 46:46.301
Indeed. Yes, indeed.

46:46.311 --> 46:49.384
Well, wonderful. Great effort.

Connor Roy.

46:51.644 --> 46:54.925
People have a lot of
preconceptions about me, too.

46:54.935 --> 46:57.134
It's difficult.

46:57.144 --> 47:00.175
I mean, not... like
I'm sure everything is for you,

47:00.185 --> 47:02.426
- but, you know.
- Right.

47:02.436 --> 47:04.217
See, I actually have this idea

47:04.227 --> 47:05.967
that social equality could be effected

47:05.977 --> 47:08.259
by a complete eradication
of federal support.

47:08.269 --> 47:11.092
Just people like you and I,
doin' it together,

47:11.102 --> 47:13.598
- fighting it out without all the
bullshit... - OK, this is me.

47:13.609 --> 47:15.175
Great! Break a leg, my friend.

- Really.

48:50.728 --> 48:52.509
Hey, terrific evening, huh?

48:52.519 --> 48:56.759
You really showed it to those
cystic fibrosis fuckheads, huh?

48:56.769 --> 48:59.925
Well, it's all about the charity.
It's not about me, buddy.

48:59.935 --> 49:01.144

- OK, thanks.

You won't believe what people

It's amazing! We tore it up.

49:08.977 --> 49:11.551
We nailed it, man! Score, team RECNY!

You're awesome, dude. You're

STEWY: There's a $40
billion market cap

50:16.853 --> 50:19.050
waiting to see if he makes it.

50:19.060 --> 50:22.509
If he falls, I'm gonna lose
one of my several houses,

50:22.519 --> 50:24.227
and you're gonna pay for the next one.

50:26.977 --> 50:29.801
My God, he's really milking the walk.

50:29.811 --> 50:32.019

uh... evening. (CHUCKLES)

50:51.894 --> 50:54.676
First, I'd, uh,

50:54.686 --> 50:58.593
I'd like to thank my wife,
Marcia, for, uh...

50:58.603 --> 50:59.769
everything.

51:02.603 --> 51:03.894
Thank you.

51:05.144 --> 51:07.050
Uh, thanks,

51:07.060 --> 51:08.967
thanks to you all for coming,

51:08.977 --> 51:12.217
and thanks to those
who have supported me

51:12.227 --> 51:14.801
during my recent

51:14.811 --> 51:18.050
health nonsense.

51:18.060 --> 51:20.718
Head cold. (CHUCKLES)

51:20.728 --> 51:23.967
Yeah, uh, yeah, that's, uh, yeah.

51:23.977 --> 51:26.634
So...

51:26.644 --> 51:28.394
personal n-news.

51:30.269 --> 51:35.259
Someone took advantage

51:35.269 --> 51:39.884
of me being in the hospital,

51:39.894 --> 51:42.967
to...

51:42.977 --> 51:46.843
propose...

51:46.853 --> 51:48.426
to my daughter.

51:48.436 --> 51:51.426
So I'd like to take this opportunity

51:51.436 --> 51:56.676
to welcome her fiancé,
Tom Wamsgans, to the family.

51:56.686 --> 51:58.509
Welcome to the family, Tom.

51:58.519 --> 52:00.436
(APPLAUSE)

52:01.603 --> 52:04.259
It's so, so important

52:04.269 --> 52:09.311
that children are supported
and encouraged.

52:10.644 --> 52:12.311
And, uh...

52:14.311 --> 52:16.426
everything I've done,

52:16.436 --> 52:18.967
I've done for my children.

52:18.977 --> 52:22.134
And I'm proud of the way

52:22.144 --> 52:25.301
that they've pulled together

52:25.311 --> 52:27.634
during my issue.

52:27.644 --> 52:31.217
And, in particular,

52:31.227 --> 52:34.019
my son... Kendall.

52:35.561 --> 52:37.467
(APPLAUSE)

52:37.477 --> 52:39.269
Well done, Ken.

52:42.352 --> 52:44.593
And now

52:44.603 --> 52:48.259
for one last announcement of the night.

52:48.269 --> 52:51.519
I'm officially announcing...

52:55.227 --> 52:57.009
I'm back.

52:57.019 --> 52:58.092

Yeah, nice one. Way to go, Dad.

53:35.769 --> 53:37.884
Why would you do that? Huh?

53:37.894 --> 53:39.925
I see you.

53:39.935 --> 53:42.967
I spied you fuckin' out, son.
Don't ever do that to me again.

53:42.977 --> 53:45.801
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

53:45.811 --> 53:48.384
Retire me, shoot me like
a dog in the street.

53:48.394 --> 53:50.426
I heard about your little speech.

53:50.436 --> 53:53.925
My speech? I was gonna do one fuckin'
joke about how you'd never retire.

53:53.935 --> 53:56.384
Bullshit!

53:56.394 --> 53:59.009
Why didn't you just talk to me?

53:59.019 --> 54:00.227
Fuck off.

54:04.394 --> 54:07.134
OK, OK. Pa. You're all right.

54:07.144 --> 54:08.967
OK. Thanks, Mark.

You did well tonight.

54:19.227 --> 54:22.092
I'm really, really proud of you.

54:22.102 --> 54:23.759
I can no longer obey, Dad.

Hey.

54:55.144 --> 54:58.426
You know, look, Anna...

54:58.436 --> 55:00.801
can I just ask...

55:00.811 --> 55:04.175
is there something... going on here?

55:04.185 --> 55:06.634
- As in?
- I don't know,

55:06.644 --> 55:10.009
is there an atmosphere? Did I
say something to offend you?

55:10.019 --> 55:12.509
This has been a lovely evening.

55:12.519 --> 55:14.301
I was so happy to come.

55:14.311 --> 55:17.467
So, am I crazy?

55:17.477 --> 55:19.801
I feel like I'm on a date with an app.

55:19.811 --> 55:23.352
Like there's this invisible bubble wrap.

55:25.185 --> 55:26.977

off the record,

off off,

55:32.185 --> 55:34.676
you seem like a nice... guy.

55:34.686 --> 55:35.894
Thank you.

55:37.352 --> 55:38.884
Eva told me to come.

55:38.894 --> 55:40.801
Asked. I mean,

55:40.811 --> 55:43.342
I asked her to just,
you know, ask your people.

55:43.352 --> 55:45.217
It's fine.

55:45.227 --> 55:47.342
I'm just seeing someone,

55:47.352 --> 55:49.884
but y-you... you're the boss.

55:49.894 --> 55:52.384
No. No, no, no. I'm... I'm not that guy.

55:52.394 --> 55:55.175
Yeah, sure. No. I'm...

55:55.185 --> 55:58.217
But actually, you are the guy.
Right now.

55:58.227 --> 56:00.467
(HUMORLESS CHUCKLE)

56:00.477 --> 56:02.551
What did she say? Eva?

56:02.561 --> 56:03.843
Nothing.

56:03.853 --> 56:05.509
Come on. Please, just...

56:05.519 --> 56:10.593
To make sure that you had
a really good time.

56:10.603 --> 56:12.426
Was she joking?

56:12.436 --> 56:14.217
Sure. (LAUGHS)

56:14.227 --> 56:18.175
OK, uh, and I'd prefer it

56:18.185 --> 56:19.894
if you didn't say anything.

56:22.060 --> 56:24.593
Well, uh, I think I should.

56:24.603 --> 56:26.092
Please don't.

56:26.102 --> 56:27.561
OK. Sure.

56:31.227 --> 56:34.009
Hey, come on, man. This is our charity.

56:34.019 --> 56:37.050
How much a plate? You gotta
get at least a blow job.

56:37.060 --> 56:38.394
That's the law.

56:40.394 --> 56:42.092
That's not the law.

56:42.102 --> 56:44.092
Well, it's the ethical code, then,

56:44.102 --> 56:45.509
and I hate to say this,

56:45.519 --> 56:47.394
but she's behaved
rather unethically here.

57:23.477 --> 57:26.217
Keep talking.

57:26.227 --> 57:28.227
I aim to please, ma'am.
