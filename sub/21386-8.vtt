WEBVTT

00:03.047 --> 00:04.881
Footage has surfaced
of an altercation

00:04.881 --> 00:07.631
in which Ricky Jerret appears to
assault a teenage boy.

00:07.631 --> 00:08.673
(GRUNTS)

00:09.590 --> 00:12.173
You're suffering from
post-concussion syndrome, Ricky.

00:12.173 --> 00:12.964
What?

00:14.089 --> 00:15.298
You're firing me, Charles?

00:15.298 --> 00:17.423
No, Siefert's firing you.
I'm just telling you.

00:18.797 --> 00:19.839
See you, coach.

00:20.590 --> 00:24.590
Spencer, say hi to
the acquisitions team at IMG.

00:24.590 --> 00:26.214
JOE KRUTEL: Why are you
such a masochist, man?

00:26.214 --> 00:27.548
We've got a great business
going here.

00:27.548 --> 00:28.922
SPENCER STRASMORE:
If we've done our jobs,

00:28.922 --> 00:31.298
then clients have learned to
look after themselves.

00:32.964 --> 00:34.089
We're selling ASM.

00:43.423 --> 00:45.131
â™ª Kane is in the building,
nigga... â™ª

00:45.131 --> 00:47.256
( music playing )

00:59.006 --> 01:01.964
â™ª Now tell me
how you love it,
you know you at the top â™ª

01:01.964 --> 01:06.381
â™ª When only heaven's
right above it, we on â™ª

01:06.381 --> 01:08.465
â™ª 'Cause we on â™ª

01:08.465 --> 01:11.423
â™ª Who else
is really trying to fuck
with Hollywood Cole? â™ª

01:11.423 --> 01:13.131
â™ª I'm with
Marley G, bro â™ª

01:13.131 --> 01:16.465
â™ª Flying Hollygrove chicks
to my Hollywood shows â™ª

01:16.465 --> 01:19.631
â™ª And I wanna tell you
something that you probably
should know â™ª

01:19.631 --> 01:22.922
â™ª This that
"Slumdog Millionaire"
Bollywood flow â™ª

01:22.922 --> 01:24.465
â™ª And, uh â™ª

01:24.465 --> 01:26.548
â™ª My real friends
never hearing from me â™ª

01:26.548 --> 01:29.381
â™ª Fake friends
write the wrong answers
on the mirror for me â™ª

01:29.381 --> 01:32.506
â™ª That's why
I pick and choose,
I don't get shit confused â™ª

01:32.506 --> 01:36.131
â™ª Don't like my women single,
I like my chicks in twos â™ª

01:36.131 --> 01:38.881
â™ª And these days
all the girls is down
to roll â™ª

01:38.881 --> 01:41.756
â™ª I hit the strip club
and all them bitches
find the pole â™ª

01:41.756 --> 01:45.131
â™ª Plus, I been sippin',
so this shit is moving
kinda slow â™ª

01:45.131 --> 01:49.089
â™ª Just tell my girl
to tell her friend that
it's time to go. â™ª

01:49.089 --> 01:52.131
( men shouting )

01:54.506 --> 01:56.465
( exhales )

01:56.465 --> 01:58.673
( seagulls screeching )

02:05.881 --> 02:08.590
- Morning, sailor.
- ( chuckles ) Good morning,
honey.

02:08.590 --> 02:10.256
Have you seen
my toothbrush?

02:10.256 --> 02:12.715
Mm, yeah,
it's in the shower.

02:12.715 --> 02:14.298
Cool, I was gonna
check the shower

02:14.298 --> 02:16.173
after I checked the microwave
and the dishwasher.

02:16.173 --> 02:17.631
( Chloe chuckles )
I always brush my teeth
in the shower.

02:17.631 --> 02:19.381
( chuckles ) I see that.
You might wanna try

02:19.381 --> 02:22.047
brushing your teeth
on your side of the sink
using your toothbrush.

02:22.047 --> 02:23.590
It's pink.
I got it for you.

02:23.590 --> 02:26.047
I could put "Chloe"
right there on the handle
if you like.

02:26.047 --> 02:28.715
Well, I like
your electric jobbie

02:28.715 --> 02:30.590
'cause it works great
as a vibrator

02:30.590 --> 02:32.339
on those lonely nights
when you're not home.

02:32.339 --> 02:34.465
Ah, okay, well,
I'll buy you one
of those, too.

02:34.465 --> 02:36.131
( chuckles )
Lighten up.

02:36.131 --> 02:38.256
You're the only one
that I'm using as a sex toy.

02:38.256 --> 02:40.131
Thank you, I hope so, baby.
Listen, I gotta tell ya,

02:40.131 --> 02:42.631
in less than a week,
you've completely rearranged
my kitchen--

02:42.631 --> 02:43.964
Oh, you try finding
cereal in that cupboard.

02:43.964 --> 02:45.465
Look at
my bathroom counter.

02:45.465 --> 02:47.423
It looks like the makeup
counter at Sephora

02:47.423 --> 02:49.381
after a massive
fucking earthquake.

02:49.381 --> 02:50.797
- Okay, this?
- Mm-hmm.

02:50.797 --> 02:52.381
This doesn't happen
without a workout

02:52.381 --> 02:55.089
and a little
war paint, okay?

02:55.089 --> 02:56.256
- Want some coffee?
- I do.

02:56.256 --> 02:58.631
- ( spanks )
- I want more than coffee.

02:58.631 --> 03:01.256
( ringtone playing )

03:08.590 --> 03:10.590
- Hey, Doc.
- Woman: Hello,
Mr. Strasmore.

03:10.590 --> 03:12.089
This is
Dr. Dester's office.

03:12.089 --> 03:14.256
He'd like you to come in
for your results today.

03:14.256 --> 03:16.006
You know, I wish
I could make it,

03:16.006 --> 03:18.173
but I have
a company retreat
that I can't miss.

03:18.173 --> 03:20.881
Oh, those are fun.
Well, let us know when
your schedule clears up.

03:20.881 --> 03:24.423
Hold on, is there any way
that you could give me
the results now?

03:24.423 --> 03:26.131
For situations
like yours,

03:26.131 --> 03:28.423
Dr. Dester prefers
to talk in person.

03:30.756 --> 03:32.881
( sighs )
It's not cancer, is it?

03:32.881 --> 03:34.631
The test
was for sperm count.

03:34.631 --> 03:36.797
Right, uh,

03:36.797 --> 03:38.590
well, listen, I mean,
how did it come back?

03:38.590 --> 03:40.506
Did it come back average,
above average,

03:40.506 --> 03:42.590
off the fucking charts?
Tell me.

03:42.590 --> 03:45.131
You're welcome
to come in at 11:00
and find out for yourself

03:45.131 --> 03:48.590
or you can just
let your imagination
run wild for a week.

03:48.590 --> 03:51.590
( chuckles )
Okay. Okay, okay, fine.

03:51.590 --> 03:54.047
Fine, I'll see you
soon, bully.

03:54.047 --> 03:55.964
- ( music playing )
- Could life get any better?

03:55.964 --> 03:58.423
Yeah, if you pass
that motherfucking bottle.

03:58.423 --> 04:00.631
Oh, what are we drinking?
I love it.

04:00.631 --> 04:02.922
Good drink.
I'll take it easy, though.

04:02.922 --> 04:04.964
Okay. Hello.

04:04.964 --> 04:08.047
- ( ringtone playing )
- â™ª Pick up the phone, baby! â™ª

04:08.047 --> 04:09.964
â™ª I know
you're home, baby! â™ª

04:09.964 --> 04:11.881
â™ª I'm in
the zone, baby. â™ª

04:11.881 --> 04:13.298
What's crackin', ace?

04:13.298 --> 04:14.715
Where the fuck
have you been?

04:14.715 --> 04:18.797
Uh, where I can
always be found--
cloud nine.

04:18.797 --> 04:21.006
Make that
nine and a half.

04:21.006 --> 04:25.006
Great, well, now it's time
to touch down on planet Earth
and deliver that land.

04:25.006 --> 04:27.465
I'm selling my company.
It's the least you could do.

04:27.465 --> 04:30.715
Shit, Strasmore's
going all in.
I love it.

04:30.715 --> 04:33.423
Maybe you should come
kick it with Travis and I
at the casino

04:33.423 --> 04:35.256
since you're in
such a gambling mood.

04:35.256 --> 04:37.339
Too busy pulling rabbits
out of my ass, Wayne.

04:37.339 --> 04:39.339
Might have to give you
a residency, too.

04:39.339 --> 04:40.797
Look, stop
fucking around, okay?

04:40.797 --> 04:42.339
The owners are gonna meet
in about a week and a half,

04:42.339 --> 04:43.839
and if we don't
get our shit together,

04:43.839 --> 04:45.339
this whole fucking thing
can go south.

04:45.339 --> 04:47.548
Relax, we're golden
with the land.

04:47.548 --> 04:49.089
( sighs )
All right,
did you pick up

04:49.089 --> 04:51.173
those abandoned projects
north of the Strip?

04:51.173 --> 04:54.089
- That spot's a dump.
- So, you're gonna put up
your golf course?

04:54.089 --> 04:56.089
My father dropped dead
on that course, buddy.

04:56.089 --> 04:58.173
It's a monument
to the Hastings name.

04:58.173 --> 05:01.423
There are over
500 monuments around the globe
in the Hastings name, Wayne.

05:01.423 --> 05:04.047
- Who gives a shit?
- And Daddy dropped dead
on one of them,

05:04.047 --> 05:05.715
so you can
back off it now.

05:05.715 --> 05:07.673
Okay, Wayne,

05:07.673 --> 05:10.881
I just wanna know exactly
where we're gonna build
this thing, huh?

05:10.881 --> 05:13.173
- That's it.
- I'm meeting with
the seller later on.

05:13.173 --> 05:15.089
Will send pics
once we're locked.

05:15.089 --> 05:16.631
Hope your phone
has 4K.

05:16.631 --> 05:19.922
- Okay.
- ( console beeps )

05:19.922 --> 05:22.339
( sighs )
Fuck.

05:22.339 --> 05:24.590
It's a good thing
that they diagnosed you.

05:24.590 --> 05:26.922
It earns us another chance
with the Pats.

05:26.922 --> 05:30.006
Yeah, the team
can't cut ties with you
just 'cause you batshit crazy.

05:30.006 --> 05:33.381
- Bipolar, bipolar.
- It's a bad look to
put you out on the streets.

05:33.381 --> 05:35.339
Pssh, being diagnosed
as bipolar

05:35.339 --> 05:37.839
is one of the few things
that actually makes sense
this off-season.

05:37.839 --> 05:40.631
Keep taking your pills,
stick at it with therapy,

05:40.631 --> 05:42.381
the Pats will commit
to you long term.

05:42.381 --> 05:45.006
Man, I ain't fucking
with these pills, J.

05:45.006 --> 05:47.756
- It'll affect my performance.
- On the field or in the sack?

05:47.756 --> 05:50.381
- Both.
- You don't take the pills,
you don't suit up.

05:50.381 --> 05:52.839
Well, what's it matter
if I'm too doped up
to do my job?

05:52.839 --> 05:54.423
I'm sure they're
not that bad.

05:54.423 --> 05:56.590
Shit, T, Google
the side effects.

05:56.590 --> 05:58.131
The fuck I look like,
Siri?

05:58.131 --> 05:59.631
Ricky:
So sensitive.

05:59.631 --> 06:02.548
"Common side effects
may include, but are
not limited to

06:02.548 --> 06:05.339
fatigue, nausea,
vertigo,

06:05.339 --> 06:08.922
diarrhea, constipation,
and sexual dysfunction."

06:08.922 --> 06:10.964
Right, that sounds fun.
I'm gonna be walking
around here

06:10.964 --> 06:13.256
tired, limp, dizzy,
and shitting my own pants.

06:13.256 --> 06:15.797
That sounds crazier than
punching some white kid
in the face.

06:15.797 --> 06:18.548
- There's no guarantee you'll
have any side effects at all.
- Don't worry about it.

06:18.548 --> 06:21.131
I mean, if there are,
they could just give you
more pills to fix that shit.

06:21.131 --> 06:23.256
- I'm glad everybody's so
concerned about my health.
- ( phone chimes )

06:23.256 --> 06:25.298
- Oh, fuck me.
- Ricky: More bad news?

06:25.298 --> 06:27.131
Yeah, but not for you.
For Charles.

06:27.131 --> 06:28.298
- Ooh.
- Thank God.

06:28.298 --> 06:29.423
Pass me one
of them grapes, cuz.

06:29.423 --> 06:31.465
You got it.
Bam!

06:31.465 --> 06:33.797
Well, we're always
looking for new talent
to boost our staff.

06:33.797 --> 06:35.131
- Yeah.
- So, you know what?

06:35.131 --> 06:36.423
I'll let you guys
talk it over privately.

06:36.423 --> 06:37.839
Great!
Thanks for
the tour, Lydia.

06:37.839 --> 06:39.256
- Yeah, you're welcome.
- Thanks so much, Lydia.

06:39.256 --> 06:41.006
All right, bye-bye.

06:41.006 --> 06:42.715
Text you later.
Ooh!

06:42.715 --> 06:45.131
She's impressive.
This whole place
is impressive.

06:45.131 --> 06:47.590
- Jeez, you're really
slurping the Kool-Aid.
- I'm not slurping anything.

06:47.590 --> 06:50.465
I'm just saying
our employees are gonna be
very comfortable here.

06:50.465 --> 06:53.131
- It's nice and stable.
- Fuck, I just don't
think our staff

06:53.131 --> 06:55.339
is gonna fit in
with IMG culture,
you know?

06:55.339 --> 06:58.339
I mean, Byron has more porn
on his hard drive than I do.

06:58.339 --> 07:00.964
Phil is
borderline homicidal.

07:00.964 --> 07:03.131
Natalie, precious,
little Natalie, okay?

07:03.131 --> 07:04.922
Every Friday,
she goes into the bathroom

07:04.922 --> 07:07.715
- and sniffs Wite-Out
before happy hour.
- Wow.

07:07.715 --> 07:11.506
And Marcus curses
more in casual conversation
than you or I combined.

07:11.506 --> 07:13.298
That is
fucking impossible.

07:13.298 --> 07:16.673
I don't know,
it just feels like
our outfit is a band of misfits,

07:16.673 --> 07:20.673
- you know, who excel
at unconventional warfare.
- Mm-hmm.

07:20.673 --> 07:22.256
And that's why we love them,
by the way, you know?

07:22.256 --> 07:23.881
That's why we love
our company.

07:23.881 --> 07:26.298
Yeah, well, you know,
they're also survivors, okay?

07:26.298 --> 07:28.131
They're gonna be fine
wherever they land,

07:28.131 --> 07:31.214
whether it's here or--
thank you very much--
or anyplace else.

07:31.214 --> 07:34.006
What about our clients?
How are you gonna drop
the bomb to them?

07:34.006 --> 07:37.756
Ricky, Vern, Charles,
Sizzle, Antonio, Suh.

07:37.756 --> 07:40.047
I will handle it.
I got it all under control.

07:40.047 --> 07:42.131
We need the appraisers
over at ASM by 2:00 p.m.

07:42.131 --> 07:44.631
- Did you set the diversion?
- Yeah, I rented the Ritz
ballroom

07:44.631 --> 07:47.465
for ASM's
meditation retreat.

07:47.465 --> 07:50.423
A real bitch
finding a Zen master
on short notice, by the way.

07:50.423 --> 07:52.548
What the fuck happened
to going down to the Keys
and getting plastered?

07:52.548 --> 07:54.922
Oh, please, come on,
you don't fire
a drunken mob.

07:54.922 --> 07:56.465
Phil will
fucking shiv you.

07:56.465 --> 07:59.006
At least this way,
they'll learn coping skills

07:59.006 --> 08:00.506
before you drop
the bomb.

08:00.506 --> 08:02.381
Oh, listen,
that reminds me--

08:02.381 --> 08:04.256
No, don't! No.
Don't say that
you're gonna be late.

08:04.256 --> 08:05.673
( chuckles )
I'm gonna be
a little late.

08:05.673 --> 08:06.922
- Ugh!
- It's all right.

08:06.922 --> 08:09.631
I just can't cancel
my lunch with Chloe.

08:09.631 --> 08:11.381
- Chloe?
- Yes.

08:11.381 --> 08:14.756
Ugh, here. God damn.
What, are you two all
shacked up now?

08:14.756 --> 08:16.548
( chuckles )
Well, it fucking
seems that way,

08:16.548 --> 08:18.214
but she's in town
just for business.

08:18.214 --> 08:19.839
Oh, well,
that's good.

08:19.839 --> 08:21.298
You can still
get rid of her.

08:21.298 --> 08:23.089
I'm not getting rid
of her, Joe.

08:23.089 --> 08:25.881
Yeah, you will.
I mean, you always do.

08:25.881 --> 08:27.839
Look, I gotta go
set this shit up.

08:27.839 --> 08:30.465
Hey, don't you
fucking dare

08:30.465 --> 08:32.298
make me do
your dirty work
for you.

08:32.298 --> 08:33.548
Why the fuck do you
say it like that for?

08:33.548 --> 08:35.506
- I never do that.
- All right.

08:35.506 --> 08:37.256
I might get
one of these things.

08:37.256 --> 08:40.006
- ( engine starts )
- Oh! Shit.

08:40.006 --> 08:43.047
Coughlin and Smith
have had success with
schemes similar to ours,

08:43.047 --> 08:45.839
but I believe
it's Lions' OC,
Jim Bob Cooter,

08:45.839 --> 08:47.506
- who's the future
leader of this team.
- ( phone buzzing )

08:47.506 --> 08:49.173
If Stafford
hadn't gotten hurt,

08:49.173 --> 08:51.256
the Lions would've made
some noise in the playoffs.

08:53.256 --> 08:55.548
Yeah, didn't they finish
bottom third

08:55.548 --> 08:57.131
in the run game
during that span?

08:57.131 --> 08:58.756
It's a passing league.

08:58.756 --> 09:01.465
A high-flying offense is
what it takes to compete
with the Pats.

09:01.465 --> 09:03.089
- We got the pieces.
- ( phone chimes )

09:03.089 --> 09:05.256
Now we just need the right man
to put them together.

09:08.089 --> 09:10.256
You got more
important business,
sweet cheeks?

09:10.256 --> 09:11.964
( phone chimes )

09:15.339 --> 09:17.298
No. No, sir.

09:17.298 --> 09:19.423
Wife seems to think that
Kiki may have allergies.

09:19.423 --> 09:21.006
They got all-natural
antihistamines

09:21.006 --> 09:22.465
at the Whole Foods
on 10th Street.

09:22.465 --> 09:23.797
Thank you.

09:23.797 --> 09:25.423
I'll let her know
as soon as we're done here.

09:25.423 --> 09:26.465
Good.

09:26.465 --> 09:29.381
Care to offer
any thoughts?

09:29.381 --> 09:31.964
Oh, yeah, I like where
you're going with this.

09:31.964 --> 09:34.964
- Cooter.
- I don't want
a yes man, Charles.

09:34.964 --> 09:36.339
Tell me what
you really think.

09:36.339 --> 09:38.715
( sighs )

09:38.715 --> 09:42.047
All right,
with the emergence of Ajayi
and the addition of Kisan,

09:42.047 --> 09:44.548
we got a serious
two-headed monster
in our backfield.

09:44.548 --> 09:46.381
We can't abandon
the run.

09:46.381 --> 09:47.839
Winning sells
just as many tickets

09:47.839 --> 09:49.922
as chunking the ball up
40 times a game.

09:49.922 --> 09:52.173
Who you got in mind
to lead this running attack?

09:52.173 --> 09:54.006
Larry Csonka.

09:54.006 --> 09:56.298
Absolutely not.

09:56.298 --> 09:58.006
Then, as I said
the first time,

09:58.006 --> 10:00.298
I think
Cooter's the guy.

10:00.298 --> 10:01.631
Me, too.

10:01.631 --> 10:04.298
- ( chatter )
- ( wind chimes tinkling )

10:06.131 --> 10:08.089
( whispering )
Hey, can I get
your cell phone?

10:08.089 --> 10:09.548
- Ugh.
- I know, I know.

10:09.548 --> 10:12.673
- Gotta take the cell phone.
- Oh, Joe!

10:12.673 --> 10:15.506
- You have no idea
how much this means.
- Cool, man.

10:15.506 --> 10:18.465
Yeah, I was on the verge
of a full-on meltdown.

10:18.465 --> 10:20.173
Well, you've been working
really hard, you know?

10:20.173 --> 10:22.673
So maybe this will give you
some balance and perspective.

10:22.673 --> 10:24.673
Yeah, I was gonna
shoot someone.

10:24.673 --> 10:26.006
Not you, of course.

10:26.006 --> 10:29.047
Someone bad
like the homeless guy
at my ATM.

10:29.047 --> 10:33.214
- Yeah, put your cell phone
in the basket.
- Oh. Okay.

10:35.298 --> 10:37.339
- Yo, yo, yo, motherfucker!
- Shh, shh, shh.

10:37.339 --> 10:39.214
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm ready to do this shit.

10:39.214 --> 10:40.797
- I bet you are,
I bet you are.
- Yeah.

10:40.797 --> 10:43.756
And afterwards,
we crush the hotel bar.

10:43.756 --> 10:46.214
- All right, we do it.
- I brought a gram of snizz.

10:46.214 --> 10:48.423
Namaste!

10:48.423 --> 10:50.381
Okay.

10:50.381 --> 10:51.839
( whispers )
Hey, Nat.

10:51.839 --> 10:53.590
I gotta take
the cell phone.

10:53.590 --> 10:55.298
I can't do that.

10:55.298 --> 10:57.590
- Hmm?
- My little BeyoncÃ©
is sick with a cold.

10:57.590 --> 10:59.214
The sitter
might call, so.

10:59.214 --> 11:02.590
Ah, look,
this is just gonna be
for a short time, I promise.

11:02.590 --> 11:04.797
You know?
And so, I'm sure
your daughter's gonna be fine.

11:04.797 --> 11:07.715
- BeyoncÃ©'s my pit bull.
- Oh.

11:07.715 --> 11:09.423
( whispers )
Where's the bathroom?

11:09.423 --> 11:11.381
Nat, come on,
it's not even 5:00 yet.

11:11.381 --> 11:15.173
Why don't we try meditation
before we resort to that,
you know?

11:15.173 --> 11:18.256
- Okay.
- Yeah. And you know what?
Keep the phone.

11:18.256 --> 11:20.214
- Thank you.
- Don't tell anybody.

11:20.214 --> 11:22.756
- I won't.
- Okay. ( chuckles )

11:22.756 --> 11:25.047
- ( sighs ) Oh, God.
- You ain't getting my phone.

11:25.047 --> 11:27.381
I don't want
your fucking phone.

11:27.381 --> 11:28.922
So, you running
this show today?

11:28.922 --> 11:30.256
( scoffs )
Yeah, right.

11:30.256 --> 11:32.131
- Imagine?
- Mm-mm.

11:32.131 --> 11:35.964
But I found the most
reputable Zen master
on the East Coast.

11:35.964 --> 11:38.423
Hoo!
Sorry I'm late.

11:38.423 --> 11:41.381
Biscayne Blvd. was
a fucking nightmare.

11:41.381 --> 11:44.006
- Oh, hi, Virginia.
- Maximo?

11:44.006 --> 11:45.797
That's right, Maximo.

11:45.797 --> 11:47.548
- He's certified.
- In what?

11:47.548 --> 11:50.756
Everything you need.
Just give him 12 hours.

11:54.089 --> 11:56.756
- Jesus Christ.
- ( Dr. Dester chuckles )

11:56.756 --> 11:59.797
- My God, the irony.
- ( chuckles ) Yeah.

11:59.797 --> 12:02.298
- I'm much better
with vaginas, Doc.
- Let's hope so.

12:02.298 --> 12:05.131
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't worry about it,
don't worry about it.

12:05.131 --> 12:06.922
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

12:06.922 --> 12:09.339
Uh, so, I'm good,
right?

12:09.339 --> 12:12.590
I, uh-- I mean, I've never
actually gotten a, um--

12:12.590 --> 12:14.631
gotten a woman
pregnant before,

12:14.631 --> 12:18.173
but I'm sure with
the scroll of lovely ladies
I have in my phone

12:18.173 --> 12:20.797
that one of my swimmers
accidentally hit land,

12:20.797 --> 12:22.756
considering I had
this one three-peat

12:22.756 --> 12:25.797
at the Pro Bowl
back in 2011.

12:25.797 --> 12:27.673
You went to the Pro Bowl
three times in a row?

12:28.881 --> 12:30.715
No, come on, Doc!

12:30.715 --> 12:32.173
Travis Scott?

12:32.173 --> 12:34.298
â™ª I just hit
a three-peat â™ª

12:34.298 --> 12:36.715
â™ª Fucked three hoes
I met this week. â™ª

12:36.715 --> 12:39.839
Except I did all that
in a weekend.

12:39.839 --> 12:44.298
- ( both chuckling )
- Well, according to
your test results,

12:44.298 --> 12:46.339
you do have
functioning swimmers.

12:46.339 --> 12:47.922
- Great.
- Yes.

12:47.922 --> 12:50.047
They're just
more Ryan Lochte
than Michael Phelps.

12:50.047 --> 12:53.339
- Okay, Olympians. Great.
- ( chuckles )

12:53.339 --> 12:55.214
They're declining
at a rapid rate.

12:57.673 --> 13:00.006
- Okay.
- Could be genetic

13:00.006 --> 13:02.298
or could be
lifestyle choices.

13:02.298 --> 13:05.089
I mean,
excessive drinking,
heavy stress,

13:05.089 --> 13:07.756
substance abuse,
smoking, cycling--

13:07.756 --> 13:11.673
No, I mean, look, Doc,
I haven't ridden a bicycle
since I was 11 years old

13:11.673 --> 13:14.381
and I've never had
a cigarette in my life.

13:14.381 --> 13:16.922
Well, according
to Dr. Robbins' file,

13:16.922 --> 13:19.381
three of those factors
are in play.

13:19.381 --> 13:22.631
( chuckles )
Right, well,
I am working very hard

13:22.631 --> 13:24.590
at weaning myself
off the booze

13:24.590 --> 13:26.922
and, um-- and getting rid
of all the pills.

13:26.922 --> 13:28.381
I mean, and plus,
right after this,

13:28.381 --> 13:29.881
I'm going to
a meditation seminar.

13:29.881 --> 13:33.423
All positive steps,
but the damage is
already done.

13:35.673 --> 13:37.590
No, don't say that, Doc.

13:37.590 --> 13:39.047
Come on,
don't say that.

13:39.047 --> 13:42.006
I mean-- I mean,
look, man, I've--

13:42.006 --> 13:45.465
I've given my life
to a fucking game

13:45.465 --> 13:47.548
that doesn't give a fuck
about me anymore.

13:47.548 --> 13:50.256
The only chance that I have
for any kind of legacy

13:50.256 --> 13:52.423
and not be
a goddamn ghost

13:52.423 --> 13:53.922
is to have
a goddamn kid.

13:55.465 --> 13:57.506
That is literally
the most selfish thing

13:57.506 --> 13:59.964
I have ever heard
anyone say.

13:59.964 --> 14:01.964
And I have
10-year-old twins.

14:03.715 --> 14:08.590
- ( sighs )
- But at least
you are honest.

14:08.590 --> 14:10.381
Yeah, to a fault.

14:10.381 --> 14:13.298
- Well, how much time
do I have left?
- You're not dying.

14:13.298 --> 14:16.631
But if you are serious
about having a child
for any reason

14:16.631 --> 14:18.089
other than
the one you just gave,

14:18.089 --> 14:21.756
I suggest
you hop on your pony
and ride, cowboy.

14:21.756 --> 14:24.881
- ( people chattering )
- ( sighs )

14:24.881 --> 14:26.756
( knocks )

14:26.756 --> 14:29.214
Mr. Charles,
there he is.

14:29.214 --> 14:31.715
To what do I owe
the pleasure?

14:31.715 --> 14:33.423
Cooter ain't the guy.

14:35.756 --> 14:37.298
Well, your boss
says he is.

14:37.298 --> 14:39.715
He's wrong,
and his obsession
with the aerial attack

14:39.715 --> 14:41.673
is gonna reverse
all the progress we've made.

14:41.673 --> 14:45.006
We need to focus
on our power run game.

14:45.006 --> 14:46.423
The Falcons would've
won the Super Bowl

14:46.423 --> 14:47.756
if they'd have just
ran the ball.

14:47.756 --> 14:49.298
But then look
at the Patriots.

14:49.298 --> 14:52.339
LeGarrette Blount
led the league in
rushing touchdowns.

14:52.339 --> 14:55.673
We need
a Blount offense--
pun intended.

14:55.673 --> 14:58.089
You know,
I don't appreciate
you coming in here

14:58.089 --> 15:00.298
and telling me how to run
my goddamn team.

15:00.298 --> 15:01.964
I'm just giving you
the straight truth.

15:01.964 --> 15:04.465
I feel like
a man in your position
deserves that.

15:06.506 --> 15:08.922
Look, Charles,

15:08.922 --> 15:10.964
you know ticket sales
have never been

15:10.964 --> 15:12.881
a part of
our decision-making, right?

15:12.881 --> 15:14.964
Then you best inform
your general manager,

15:14.964 --> 15:16.631
'cause that's
the tack he's taking.

15:16.631 --> 15:18.548
Now, if we wanna build
on last season,

15:18.548 --> 15:20.047
we need
to hire the man

15:20.047 --> 15:22.631
that helped lay the bricks
for Miami's success.

15:22.631 --> 15:24.673
Shula's retired,

15:24.673 --> 15:26.006
Griese has
a radio gig,

15:26.006 --> 15:29.214
and Marino-- Marino has
no interest in coaching.

15:29.214 --> 15:32.047
But Larry Csonka's
right under your nose!

15:32.047 --> 15:34.339
Think about it--
players love and respect him,

15:34.339 --> 15:36.173
and he has command
of the locker room.

15:36.173 --> 15:38.881
And don't let that
sunny disposition
of his fool you.

15:38.881 --> 15:41.339
That man has the fire
and the experience

15:41.339 --> 15:42.881
to coach this team
to a division title.

15:42.881 --> 15:44.673
Csonk's a great coach.

15:44.673 --> 15:45.964
- He's loyal.
- Mm-hmm.

15:45.964 --> 15:47.339
I've been thinking
about him.

15:47.339 --> 15:48.756
A little bit
past his prime.

15:48.756 --> 15:50.339
They said the same thing
about Arians.

15:50.339 --> 15:51.590
He won
Coach of the Year honors

15:51.590 --> 15:53.381
two out of his
first three seasons.

15:53.381 --> 15:56.590
- Siefert didn't buy it?
- Wouldn't even hear me out.

15:56.590 --> 15:59.047
We probably could've handled
that Coach Berg situation

15:59.047 --> 16:01.465
- with a little more class.
- ( scoffs ) You think?

16:01.465 --> 16:03.339
I'm the one that
had to fire the guy.

16:05.839 --> 16:08.006
Siefert didn't even
do it himself?

16:08.006 --> 16:09.214
No, sir.

16:10.381 --> 16:12.047
He didn't have
the guts.

16:15.922 --> 16:18.548
- ( music playing )
- ( ringtone playing )

16:19.881 --> 16:21.465
- Hey.
- Spencer: Hey.

16:21.465 --> 16:25.047
- Still down for a late lunch?
- Uh, not anymore.

16:25.047 --> 16:29.298
Niki Nakayama's insisting
that we taste all 13 of
her Kaiseki dishes,

16:29.298 --> 16:31.548
and Wayne wants me
back in Vegas first thing.

16:31.548 --> 16:33.047
Jesus, that's
kind of sudden.

16:33.047 --> 16:34.922
Yeah, well,
he's impulsive like that.

16:34.922 --> 16:36.506
Kind of reminds me
of another

16:36.506 --> 16:38.298
ambitious businessman
that I'm close with.

16:38.298 --> 16:41.381
Listen, Chloe,
I would really love
to see you before you leave.

16:41.381 --> 16:43.214
How about we have
a couple of drinks
tonight, huh?

16:43.214 --> 16:44.590
My retreat ends
around 9:00.

16:44.590 --> 16:46.881
Baby, I'm sorry.
I am on the last flight out.

16:46.881 --> 16:49.047
I'm gonna send
somebody by tomorrow
to grab my things.

16:49.047 --> 16:50.298
At least
spend the night.

16:50.298 --> 16:52.089
I promise I'll make it
worth your while.

16:52.089 --> 16:55.089
Could this possibly mean
eye contact while we do it?

16:56.715 --> 16:58.423
Yes, I'm gonna
deliver a deep,

16:58.423 --> 17:01.423
loving gaze
into your soul.

17:01.423 --> 17:05.590
Well, now that you got me
all hot and bothered,

17:05.590 --> 17:07.173
I'll see
what I can do.

17:07.173 --> 17:08.548
Okay, great.

17:10.881 --> 17:13.214
- ( exhales )
- ( phone chimes )

17:18.756 --> 17:20.631
- ( music playing )
- Why settle for great

17:20.631 --> 17:23.922
when we can make
America spectacular?

17:23.922 --> 17:27.465
- ( horse snorts )
- Welcome to your new home,
Raider Nation!

17:27.465 --> 17:31.465
- Welcome to Wayneville!
- ( neighs )

17:34.715 --> 17:38.298
- ( music playing )
- Maximo: Our careers
can consume our lives.

17:38.298 --> 17:40.298
Stress levels rise.

17:40.298 --> 17:42.298
Relationships suffer.

17:42.298 --> 17:46.006
We drink too much.
We self-medicate.

17:46.006 --> 17:47.797
All damaging behaviors,

17:47.797 --> 17:50.631
both physically
and spiritually.

17:50.631 --> 17:52.673
- But it's fun as balls!
- ( whispers ) Marcus.

17:52.673 --> 17:56.797
Maximo: We try to numb
all the pain that the pressure
and fear create.

17:56.797 --> 17:59.673
The fear of failure
and inadequacy.

17:59.673 --> 18:02.922
- But not missing out.
- Marcus, one more time
and you're fucking done.

18:02.922 --> 18:04.465
I mean it.

18:04.465 --> 18:06.964
That fear creates
a deep-seated anger

18:06.964 --> 18:11.214
that can't be treated with
the breathing and chanting
exercises

18:11.214 --> 18:13.631
that we've been
practicing thus far.

18:13.631 --> 18:15.964
And that concludes
this portion of the meditation.

18:15.964 --> 18:18.465
On my count--
three, two, one.

18:18.465 --> 18:21.465
- And open your eyes.
- ( all exhaling )

18:21.465 --> 18:25.089
- Wow!
- ( Maximo exhales )

18:25.089 --> 18:29.506
But sometimes anger requires
a more visceral outlet.

18:29.506 --> 18:34.256
That leads us
to the rage room.

18:34.256 --> 18:36.631
( Joe chuckles )

18:36.631 --> 18:40.715
What's
the rage room, huh?

18:40.715 --> 18:44.839
Max, tell these guys
what happens in
the rage room.

18:44.839 --> 18:48.548
Anything you like
short of starting a fire.
Destroy everything in sight.

18:48.548 --> 18:52.423
- Piss on the floor.
Shit on the desk.
- ( clears throat )

18:52.423 --> 18:55.381
- Anything within
good taste.
- Yeah.

18:55.381 --> 18:57.548
All part of
the healing process,
right?

18:57.548 --> 18:59.548
- Who's first?
- Me, me! Yep, right here.

18:59.548 --> 19:01.298
Marcus, sit down.

19:01.298 --> 19:05.298
Please! Let me
lay waste to it.

19:05.298 --> 19:08.964
Phil, I think you should do
some more deep breathing
exercises first.

19:08.964 --> 19:10.797
Just-- you can get in there,
but let's just--

19:10.797 --> 19:12.131
what, Natalie,
you wanna go in?

19:12.131 --> 19:13.797
Great,
get on up here.

19:13.797 --> 19:15.339
( chuckles )
Here she comes.

19:15.339 --> 19:16.715
- It's gonna be good.
- Yay!

19:16.715 --> 19:18.173
( elevator dings )

19:19.881 --> 19:21.715
( chatter )

19:23.173 --> 19:25.673
( music playing )

19:34.797 --> 19:37.423
â™ª This goes out to all
my Mile End friends â™ª

19:37.423 --> 19:38.922
â™ª And my Parc-Ex
connects... â™ª

19:38.922 --> 19:40.465
Joe:
Choose your weapon.

19:40.465 --> 19:43.590
- This one.
- Or just the tiny,
little axe.

19:43.590 --> 19:46.089
- Look at you,
full of surprises.
- Woman: Whoo!

19:46.089 --> 19:47.797
- All: Natalie!
- All right.

19:47.797 --> 19:49.881
All: Whoo!

19:49.881 --> 19:52.256
- ( sighs ) Here she goes.
- ( phone chimes )

19:52.256 --> 19:54.548
- ( phone chimes )
- No, Natalie,

19:54.548 --> 19:55.964
I told you,
BeyoncÃ© can wait.

19:55.964 --> 19:57.006
- We talked--
- Uh...

19:57.006 --> 19:58.590
All right, Phil,
go ahead.

19:58.590 --> 19:59.881
Yes!

20:03.590 --> 20:06.047
- Joe: Ah, fuck,
Phil, come on.
- Phil: Yeah, okay.

20:06.047 --> 20:07.756
Hey!

20:07.756 --> 20:09.047
( screams )

20:09.047 --> 20:11.964
- Whoa!
- ( all cheering )

20:14.256 --> 20:16.465
Yeah!

20:16.465 --> 20:18.256
Whoa, yeah!

20:19.631 --> 20:21.922
- ( screams )
- All: Oh!

20:21.922 --> 20:25.797
( panting ) Byron says
there are some weird men
appraising the office.

20:25.797 --> 20:27.423
Is that why
you brought us here?

20:27.423 --> 20:29.131
Are you getting rid
of us?!

20:30.465 --> 20:32.465
- ( chatter )
- Woman: Seriously?

20:34.131 --> 20:36.298
- Man: Come on.
- Natalie: What's going on?

20:36.298 --> 20:38.256
Ah, shit.

20:39.506 --> 20:41.423
( sighs )

20:42.715 --> 20:44.922
I have no idea.

20:44.922 --> 20:47.131
- ( piano music playing )
- ( chatter )

20:48.631 --> 20:49.964
( slurps )

20:51.298 --> 20:52.339
Excuse me.

20:55.506 --> 20:57.047
- ( whispers ) Hey.
- Jesus Christ.

20:57.047 --> 20:58.506
If this qualifies
as meditation,

20:58.506 --> 21:00.131
I should be a lot less
stressed right now.

21:00.131 --> 21:01.506
Shut the--
shut the fuck up.

21:01.506 --> 21:03.964
Cat's out of the bag.

21:03.964 --> 21:06.673
- Fuck, you told them
we're selling?
- Fuck, no!

21:06.673 --> 21:08.381
Byron saw the appraisers
at the office.

21:08.381 --> 21:10.590
- He texted everybody.
- Shit.

21:10.590 --> 21:13.964
I know.
Listen, hey,
are we really doing this?

21:13.964 --> 21:15.756
You're goddamn right
we're really doing this.

21:15.756 --> 21:17.673
Wayne's already got the land.
It's fucking beautiful.

21:17.673 --> 21:19.465
And IMG came in
with an amazing offer.

21:19.465 --> 21:21.173
- Yes, we're doing it.
- ( clears throat )

21:21.173 --> 21:23.214
I don't know, it's just--
obviously, the company

21:23.214 --> 21:25.173
means more to them
than we thought it did.

21:25.173 --> 21:27.006
And, really,
if we sell,

21:27.006 --> 21:29.298
the only people
that stand to benefit
are you and Anderson.

21:29.298 --> 21:30.839
Staff's out
on the street,

21:30.839 --> 21:32.548
our clients are stuck
with new handlers.

21:32.548 --> 21:37.006
Joe, this Vegas deal
gives us a greater stake
in the league, okay?

21:37.006 --> 21:38.506
Makes us legit.

21:38.506 --> 21:40.381
We become more powerful,
we could help out the players,

21:40.381 --> 21:42.214
we can fucking
influence the game.

21:42.214 --> 21:44.214
We sell ASM,
it gives me an opportunity

21:44.214 --> 21:45.590
to pay back
Ricky and Vernon

21:45.590 --> 21:47.339
and it gives you half
of the remaining $4 million.

21:47.339 --> 21:49.715
I'll give you that,
that the Ricky and
Vernon thing--

21:49.715 --> 21:51.548
wait, I get $2 million?

21:51.548 --> 21:52.839
Yes, you get
$2 million.

21:52.839 --> 21:54.881
Half of
fucking four, yes.

21:54.881 --> 21:56.256
Wow, okay.

21:56.256 --> 21:59.339
Uh, well, what are
we gonna do for them?

21:59.339 --> 22:01.173
They're gonna have
a healthy pot to
split as well.

22:01.173 --> 22:02.548
Okay?
Everybody wins.

22:04.006 --> 22:05.381
Okay.

22:05.381 --> 22:07.673
( music playing )

22:07.673 --> 22:09.673
There it is, baby.

22:09.673 --> 22:12.173
â™ª Yes, Lord, ooowee â™ª

22:12.173 --> 22:14.047
â™ª Oh, yeah â™ª

22:14.047 --> 22:16.922
- â™ª Hey, huh â™ª
- â™ª Ooowee â™ª

22:16.922 --> 22:19.964
â™ª I bet you feel so high,
got your head in the clouds â™ª

22:19.964 --> 22:22.964
- â™ª But you still
come around like â™ª
- â™ª Ooowee â™ª

22:22.964 --> 22:24.214
â™ª I see
what you started... â™ª

22:24.214 --> 22:25.756
When I first came
into this job,

22:25.756 --> 22:29.381
I had the best of intentions
and zero experience,

22:29.381 --> 22:31.006
but I learned something
about this business

22:31.006 --> 22:33.256
from each and every
single one of you.

22:34.673 --> 22:36.423
I mean, you guys
are the reason

22:36.423 --> 22:39.839
why ASM has become
such a successful and
profitable firm.

22:39.839 --> 22:41.881
Because you care more
about your clients

22:41.881 --> 22:44.339
than any other company
out there.

22:44.339 --> 22:49.339
But it's that success that has
caught the attention of IMG.

22:49.339 --> 22:53.631
And IMG has officially
put an offer out on the table

22:53.631 --> 22:56.423
to purchase our ASM.

22:56.423 --> 22:59.089
So it's with great thought
and consideration

22:59.089 --> 23:01.673
that Mr. Anderson and I
have decided

23:01.673 --> 23:04.131
to sell the division.

23:04.131 --> 23:08.548
- Man: Damn it.
- Being associated
with a firm of IMG's stature

23:08.548 --> 23:11.715
can only benefit
all of your careers.

23:11.715 --> 23:17.256
And I've put together
a very healthy, um,
parting gift.

23:17.256 --> 23:19.381
Whoa, whoa,
what parting gift?

23:19.381 --> 23:21.047
He's talking about
a severance.

23:21.047 --> 23:23.381
I'm talking
about a payout

23:23.381 --> 23:26.298
from the massive sale
that is gonna happen.

23:27.423 --> 23:28.797
And you know what?

23:28.797 --> 23:30.298
Each of you
deserves it.

23:30.298 --> 23:31.756
Phil:
This is bullshit.

23:31.756 --> 23:33.256
As soon as the papers
are signed,

23:33.256 --> 23:35.298
those corporate whores
will clip us.

23:35.298 --> 23:37.214
- Is that true?
- Maybe, maybe not.

23:37.214 --> 23:40.631
But-- but, hey,
here's what I do know.

23:40.631 --> 23:43.089
IMG, they're all
good people,

23:43.089 --> 23:45.339
and I put in
a really good word
for you guys.

23:45.339 --> 23:48.006
Look, if they come in
and they decide to do
a clean sweep,

23:48.006 --> 23:49.881
guess what,
I'm gonna be right there

23:49.881 --> 23:51.881
helping all you guys
get right back on your feet.

23:51.881 --> 23:55.839
- Okay?
- ( Marcus scoffs )
Fuck that.

23:55.839 --> 23:57.214
Man:
Come on.

24:05.173 --> 24:06.839
Nothing good
about your word.

24:14.797 --> 24:16.506
( exhales )

24:16.506 --> 24:17.964
( exhales )

24:22.173 --> 24:24.047
You know, that went
a lot fucking worse

24:24.047 --> 24:26.673
than I--
than I anticipated.

24:26.673 --> 24:29.881
I don't know
how we could expect
anything else.

24:29.881 --> 24:32.214
Fuck me.
Something I said?

24:32.214 --> 24:34.590
( sighs )

24:34.590 --> 24:36.797
I'm sorry I left you
hanging today.

24:36.797 --> 24:38.881
Huh? Oh.
Oh, forget it.

24:38.881 --> 24:41.881
I'm just as responsible
as you are.

24:41.881 --> 24:44.381
It's just that,
I don't know, man.

24:44.381 --> 24:46.047
If this is
the right thing to do,

24:46.047 --> 24:48.590
then why do I feel
so shitty?

24:48.590 --> 24:51.173
I bet that $2 million
is gonna help you feel
a little bit better.

24:53.756 --> 24:55.465
Little bit.

24:55.465 --> 24:58.173
( chuckles )

24:58.173 --> 25:00.381
I have done a lot worse
for a lot less, right?

25:00.381 --> 25:02.922
- Fucking right, you have.
- ( both chuckling )

25:04.797 --> 25:06.881
But you were
a man of the people.

25:08.423 --> 25:09.922
You fought
for our clients,

25:09.922 --> 25:12.631
you protected them,
you stood by them,

25:12.631 --> 25:14.756
you stood by me,

25:14.756 --> 25:17.423
by every single person
in that office.

25:17.423 --> 25:21.423
You even helped Anderson
when he really needed it.

25:21.423 --> 25:23.089
Yeah.

25:23.089 --> 25:25.089
But I'm afraid that

25:25.089 --> 25:29.756
somewhere in
this wild pursuit
of a mega-stadium deal,

25:29.756 --> 25:34.423
you've become just as aloof
and just as greedy

25:34.423 --> 25:37.964
as those
asshole one-percenters
we used to despise.

26:00.756 --> 26:03.797
â™ª I don't really care
if you cry â™ª

26:03.797 --> 26:06.506
â™ª On the real,
you should've never lied â™ª

26:06.506 --> 26:08.797
- â™ª Should've saw
the way she... â™ª
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

26:08.797 --> 26:12.006
I wouldn't get rid
of those, man.

26:12.006 --> 26:13.797
I don't need them, Pop.

26:13.797 --> 26:15.506
You ain't even
gonna try?

26:15.506 --> 26:17.173
All I've been doing.

26:17.173 --> 26:20.298
Trying to hold it together,
keep it in check,

26:20.298 --> 26:22.548
hang on to the man
that I am.

26:22.548 --> 26:25.256
I don't wanna take these
and turn into somebody else.

26:25.256 --> 26:27.590
People don't like who I am,
fuck it, they should just
stay away.

26:27.590 --> 26:31.548
Man, the Jerret men
have taken that route
for generations.

26:31.548 --> 26:33.423
What-- what are you
talking about?

26:33.423 --> 26:36.673
Man, our family crazy
as a motherfucker.

26:36.673 --> 26:38.922
Big Walt, my daddy?

26:38.922 --> 26:41.006
Nigga lived life like
a fucking maniac, man,

26:41.006 --> 26:43.506
till somebody picked up a gun
and shot him dead in a bar.

26:43.506 --> 26:45.173
And before that,

26:45.173 --> 26:48.006
his daddy
drank himself to death
in his living room.

26:48.006 --> 26:51.089
Look, Ricky,
every bad trait I have

26:51.089 --> 26:53.922
has come straight
down the chain.

26:53.922 --> 26:56.590
Now, don't be hardheaded
about this, son.

26:56.590 --> 26:58.839
So, if the doctors think
that those things can do
some good for you,

26:58.839 --> 27:00.339
give it a try.

27:00.339 --> 27:01.881
I mean,
there's no reason
to end up like

27:01.881 --> 27:03.089
all the other
Jarret men.

27:03.089 --> 27:05.590
You ain't
turned out so bad.

27:05.590 --> 27:07.173
Well, I had help.

27:10.506 --> 27:11.631
Yeah.

27:13.465 --> 27:16.047
Hey, man,
I started taking these
before I came to see you.

27:16.047 --> 27:18.881
- Jesus Christ.
- And that was the best
decision I ever made,

27:18.881 --> 27:20.839
and I owe it
to medication.

27:22.839 --> 27:25.715
You ain't got to
get back on that field
and catch Tommy's bullets.

27:25.715 --> 27:27.381
No, I don't.

27:27.381 --> 27:31.173
But if I was a fool,
I would say neither do you.

27:31.173 --> 27:32.839
( scoffs )

27:36.047 --> 27:39.214
â™ª Medicine, little nigga,
take some â™ª

27:39.214 --> 27:41.173
â™ª Fast car, NASCAR... â™ª

27:41.173 --> 27:43.173
( music playing )

27:45.506 --> 27:48.756
â™ª Temporary light... â™ª

27:50.465 --> 27:52.548
- Spencer: Hey.
- Hey!

27:52.548 --> 27:54.922
This how you planned
to spend your time with me?

27:54.922 --> 27:57.214
Half in the bag
feeling sorry for yourself?

27:57.214 --> 28:00.423
( chuckles )
It's not me I feel sorry for.

28:00.423 --> 28:03.590
Yeah, well, this happens
on the next level.

28:03.590 --> 28:06.673
People get hurt
all the time.

28:06.673 --> 28:09.298
You just have to keep
your eyes on the prize.

28:11.089 --> 28:12.756
Yep.

28:12.756 --> 28:14.339
Come here,
sit down.

28:14.339 --> 28:16.047
Let me ask you
something.

28:19.339 --> 28:21.131
Am I a greedy person?

28:24.089 --> 28:26.047
Do I want too much?

28:26.047 --> 28:29.590
Well, as much as
I would love to say
that you are...

28:31.797 --> 28:33.256
you're actually not.

28:34.673 --> 28:37.964
Most of the time,
you think things through.

28:37.964 --> 28:40.964
You feel
the consequences.

28:40.964 --> 28:42.465
You have
a conscience,

28:42.465 --> 28:43.673
which is more
than I can say

28:43.673 --> 28:45.797
about most men
in your spot.

28:54.631 --> 28:56.715
Come here.

28:56.715 --> 28:59.631
- ( sighs ) Right here.
- ( chuckles )

29:01.506 --> 29:05.839
â™ª So I think
I'm coming down... â™ª

29:09.047 --> 29:10.964
( Chloe panting )

29:10.964 --> 29:15.715
â™ª And freedom to fly â™ª

29:15.715 --> 29:20.089
- â™ª Said his heart's built
with holes inside... â™ª
- Oh, God. Oh, God.

29:20.089 --> 29:23.089
( moaning )

29:23.089 --> 29:27.173
â™ª But I still see stars
in your eyes... â™ª

29:27.173 --> 29:30.047
( gasping )

29:35.339 --> 29:36.839
Oh, God.

29:36.839 --> 29:38.465
( panting )

29:40.006 --> 29:41.339
Oh, fuck.

29:45.214 --> 29:46.964
Did you just...?

29:48.964 --> 29:51.465
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

29:51.465 --> 29:53.673
( clears throat )

29:53.673 --> 30:00.089
â™ª Headlights roll by â™ª

30:00.089 --> 30:03.506
â™ª But I'm still
chasing time â™ª

30:05.881 --> 30:08.922
â™ª Oh â™ª

30:08.922 --> 30:12.465
â™ª Will you still
be mine â™ª

30:12.465 --> 30:16.298
â™ª When morning comes? â™ª

30:16.298 --> 30:18.673
â™ª We'll be fine â™ª

30:18.673 --> 30:24.089
â™ª Oh â™ª

30:24.089 --> 30:28.047
- â™ª Oh â™ª
- â™ª We'll be fine â™ª

30:30.173 --> 30:35.381
â™ª I said I think
I'm coming down â™ª

30:43.548 --> 30:46.756
â™ª Yeah, yeah, yeah â™ª

30:49.590 --> 30:55.381
â™ª Yeah, yeah,
ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. â™ª
