00:35.827 --> 00:42.292


01:07.067 --> 01:09.861
So the patio
goes all the way out to the creek.

01:09.944 --> 01:12.989
Before we ordered, we took off our shoes
and waded into the water.

01:13.073 --> 01:16.159
Taking your shoes off in public.
How scandalous!

01:16.242 --> 01:17.577
Mm. I'm glad I got a pedi.

01:17.660 --> 01:21.164
Uh-huh. I doubt Cal was looking
at your toes. Tell me about dessert.

01:21.247 --> 01:23.833
Oh, it was divine.
They had this strawberry--

01:23.917 --> 01:25.794
You know I'm not asking
about that kinda dessert!

01:25.877 --> 01:27.587
-Sorry I'm late!

01:27.670 --> 01:29.631
-We're three rounds ahead of you!

01:29.714 --> 01:30.673
What?

01:31.716 --> 01:34.844
-How'd we dare start without you?

01:36.429 --> 01:39.516
I have been running
all over hell's half-acre.

01:39.599 --> 01:43.228
I mean, Sundays at that restaurant,
it… it's crazy!

01:43.311 --> 01:46.606
Plus, Annie and I have been trying
to finish prepping the food

01:46.689 --> 01:49.567
for the Vacation Bible School tomorrow,
not to mention--

01:49.651 --> 01:51.778
You've been having sex
with Ronnie Sullivan.

01:51.861 --> 01:53.530
Your seams are showing.

01:53.613 --> 01:54.781
Uh!

01:54.864 --> 01:56.699
-Mm.
-Well, I mean…

01:57.283 --> 01:58.201
I…

01:58.284 --> 01:59.702
-He…
-Ah…

01:59.786 --> 02:01.955
Yes. Once.

02:02.038 --> 02:03.581
-Uh-huh.
-Twice.

02:05.333 --> 02:08.920
Exactly how comfortable
are those beds down at the motor court?

02:09.003 --> 02:11.005
-Yeah!

02:11.089 --> 02:14.634
-Oh wait! Oh, would you lookee here?

02:14.717 --> 02:18.429
-"Maddie Townsend sent you $20."
-What are you two up to?

02:18.513 --> 02:22.058
Well, Helen Decatur's corrupted me.
She's turned me into a gambler.

02:22.142 --> 02:25.019
We had a little wager on how fast
you two would get back together.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.190
Okay. So you're not surprised?

02:29.274 --> 02:30.358
-No!
-No!

02:30.441 --> 02:33.319
I've done enough divorces to know
that anyone who wants their marriage over

02:33.403 --> 02:36.739
doesn't go 18 months
without drawing up papers.

02:36.823 --> 02:39.033
And once Cal solved
your Sullivan's problem,

02:39.117 --> 02:42.412
you could have sent Ronnie packing,
but you didn't because you love him.

02:42.495 --> 02:45.999
Oh yeah, you love him!
I know you love him!

02:47.208 --> 02:48.042
Okay.

02:48.960 --> 02:50.879
Come on, we're happy for you.

02:50.962 --> 02:52.505
Ecstatic. Aren't you?

02:52.589 --> 02:53.840
I don't know.

02:53.923 --> 02:55.967
I mean, yes,

02:56.676 --> 03:00.388
but things are complicated between us,
as you know.

03:00.471 --> 03:04.142
Have been, are, always will be, amen.

03:04.225 --> 03:07.520
I don't want Annie to get her hopes up
that we're getting back together

03:07.604 --> 03:09.731
'cause that is just not what this is.

03:09.814 --> 03:11.357
Not yet, at least.

03:11.441 --> 03:14.194
No, I get it.
You have years of history to sort through.

03:14.277 --> 03:15.195
Mm-hmm.

03:15.278 --> 03:18.781
Nothing says you can't have
a little adult fun while you do.

03:18.865 --> 03:21.075
Yeah, it's a <i>lot </i>of adult fun.

03:21.159 --> 03:23.203
-Ooh!

04:12.877 --> 04:14.212
Have you eaten here before?

04:14.295 --> 04:18.383
No, but I hear good things about the food.

04:19.676 --> 04:22.804
I just always go to Wharton's
or Sullivan's when I'm hungry.

04:22.887 --> 04:24.472
I hear Wharton's makes great pizza.

04:24.555 --> 04:25.890
Haven't you eaten there yet?

04:25.974 --> 04:28.309
-Mm-mm.
-Oh, I understand.

04:28.393 --> 04:31.396
You've only been in this town,
what is it, like, 20 minutes?

04:33.064 --> 04:36.442
Well, restaurant hours make it hard
to eat anywhere else. Hard to do much.

04:36.526 --> 04:41.406
Which is why I appreciate
you taking the time to have lunch with me.

04:49.622 --> 04:52.583
I think we need to talk
about the other night

04:53.876 --> 04:55.086
in front of the spa.

04:57.755 --> 04:59.132
I'm sorry if

05:00.508 --> 05:04.762
I gave the impression that I was looking
for something more than friendship.

05:05.346 --> 05:08.599
There's a lot of things
going on right now, and I just…

05:09.183 --> 05:13.271
Oh, no, no, there's
no need to explain.

05:13.354 --> 05:15.189
I have so much traipsing around
in my head,

05:15.273 --> 05:19.777
I… I'm lucky if I can find
Monday from a hot dog.

05:20.903 --> 05:24.240
I do wanna say that, um, I appreciate you.

05:25.867 --> 05:30.121
Your trust and your wisdom,
your friendship.

05:30.204 --> 05:32.498
It's all so important to me,

05:32.582 --> 05:36.502
and I do not wanna risk any part of this.

05:37.086 --> 05:37.920
Me neither.

05:38.004 --> 05:39.130
Well, thank you.

05:41.382 --> 05:42.216
Well.

05:42.300 --> 05:43.885
-There.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.769
Why am I suddenly craving pizza?

05:52.852 --> 05:53.811
Ah, yes.

05:53.895 --> 05:56.230
Um, can I introduce you to Wharton's?

05:56.314 --> 05:57.398
-Please.

05:57.482 --> 06:00.151
Come on, let's go. We have to tiptoe.

06:03.321 --> 06:04.864
Have a good workout.

06:04.947 --> 06:08.201
It's kind of busy in here.
Giving away free stuff?

06:08.284 --> 06:11.287
Ever since the community meeting,
more people have been stopping by.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.790
You should see the constant traffic
in and out of the café.

06:13.873 --> 06:18.378
Hm. It's well-deserved. Oh, how did
Kyle's physical therapy go this morning?

06:18.461 --> 06:19.420
It was horrible.

06:19.504 --> 06:24.175
I mean, 100% pure, unadulterated horrible.

06:24.258 --> 06:26.928
I know it makes him stronger,
but every time she just…

06:27.553 --> 06:29.597
And…

06:29.680 --> 06:31.682
I… I honestly didn't think
Kyle would make it.

06:31.766 --> 06:35.812
He almost ripped the pad in half
because he hurt so much, bless his heart.

06:35.895 --> 06:36.979
It broke my heart.

06:37.063 --> 06:39.607
I hate to push him
at his at-home exercises

06:39.690 --> 06:41.067
because he hurts so much.

06:41.651 --> 06:43.194
But I know I have to do it.

06:44.487 --> 06:46.614
I've had my fair share
of physical therapy.

06:46.697 --> 06:48.699
Would it help if I took him
to his next appointment?

06:48.783 --> 06:49.992
-Really?
-Yeah.

06:50.535 --> 06:51.494
Please, yes!

06:51.577 --> 06:55.623
If you could handle that half,
I could handle the at-home half better.

06:55.706 --> 06:57.125
Sure. Just let me know when.

06:57.208 --> 06:58.835
Thank you.

07:02.713 --> 07:03.589
Hey.

07:03.673 --> 07:05.591
-Hi.
-The spa looks great.

07:05.675 --> 07:08.594
Um, seems like you've done
a lot of work since the opening.

07:08.678 --> 07:09.637
Mm-hmm.

07:12.181 --> 07:16.185
I stopped by to see if it would be okay
for me to check in on Kyle again?

07:17.478 --> 07:18.604
Oh, I, um…

07:19.480 --> 07:23.985
I… I… I honestly don't even know
when we can make that happen.

07:25.862 --> 07:28.865
I understand. All y'all are busy.

07:31.993 --> 07:34.036
You know what? No.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.707
I know he would love to see you.

07:39.041 --> 07:42.253
So just let me…
let me look at his schedule

07:42.336 --> 07:44.630
and… and see when we can work it out.

07:44.714 --> 07:45.548
Thanks.

07:46.174 --> 07:49.552
You can just text me and let me know
what time works best for Kyle

07:49.635 --> 07:50.678
and for you.

07:50.761 --> 07:53.681
I'm working from home,
so I'm pretty flexible.

07:54.682 --> 07:55.516
Okay.

07:59.187 --> 08:00.771
Working from home?

08:05.860 --> 08:07.987
Welcome, boys. Go have a seat.

08:08.070 --> 08:09.363
-Hey.
-Bonnie!

08:09.447 --> 08:13.659
So glad you and Robbin could be with us
for Vacation Bible School.

08:13.743 --> 08:17.163
Robbin, Annie and I are gonna be in charge
of getting you from station to station.

08:17.246 --> 08:18.456
-You excited?
-Mm-hmm.

08:18.539 --> 08:19.665
Yeah.

08:19.749 --> 08:22.084
-Good evening, Townsends!
-Good evening.

08:22.168 --> 08:25.963
Katie! You excited for VBS?

08:26.047 --> 08:27.590
Annie, I wanna be in your group.

08:27.673 --> 08:30.176
You're too big, Katie.
You're in Lori and Tom's group this year.

08:30.259 --> 08:31.677
There's some killer crafts!

08:31.761 --> 08:34.180
-What about the snacks?
-My mom made them this year.

08:34.263 --> 08:37.099
Let's take a sneak peek
at some of the arts and crafts.

08:40.770 --> 08:43.147
-Hope you guys have a good time.
-Thanks.

08:44.774 --> 08:46.192
Guess we'll see you guys later.

08:48.945 --> 08:51.656
-Uh, did Pastor June give you the--
-Did you know he was coming?

08:52.156 --> 08:53.199
Hey!

08:53.282 --> 08:56.244
Hope it's cool I came
even though I don't go to church here.

08:56.327 --> 08:58.162
Somebody's post said, "All are welcome."

08:58.246 --> 09:00.414
-Kinda the motto of the church.
-Ah.

09:00.498 --> 09:04.043
You're more than welcome.
We're stoked you're here. Right, Annie?

09:04.126 --> 09:04.961
We are.

09:07.004 --> 09:10.091
I can take care of the kids.
You go take care of him.

09:15.388 --> 09:16.389
Right this way.

09:39.453 --> 09:40.538
What's up?

09:49.672 --> 09:50.631
-Ronnie!
-What?

09:50.715 --> 09:53.217
-I'm pretty sure this counts as church.
-Well…

09:53.301 --> 09:57.346
And… and besides, you told me
that you were gonna help, not flirt.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.056
Well, I mean…

09:59.140 --> 10:00.182
…can't I do both?

10:01.058 --> 10:05.354
No, not with all these children around
watching you get fresh!

10:05.438 --> 10:08.566
-We need more lemonade.
-Okay, I'll get some lemonade.

10:08.649 --> 10:09.483
Thank you.

10:14.697 --> 10:17.199
-Where are the dino nuggets?
-What?

10:17.283 --> 10:20.119
Mommy said there
would always be dino nuggets at VBS.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.788
I'm hungrier than a hornet.
Where are the dino nuggets?

10:22.872 --> 10:27.585
You know what, sweetie? You are gonna love
these grilled chicken fingers

10:28.169 --> 10:30.004
and veggie tots.

10:30.796 --> 10:33.215
And because I bet
you can mind your manners,

10:33.924 --> 10:35.801
I'm gonna give you a big-boy brownie.

10:36.886 --> 10:37.720
Hm?

10:37.803 --> 10:40.806
I… want… dino… nuggets!

10:40.890 --> 10:42.808
Well,
I am really sorry about that.

10:42.892 --> 10:44.977
But isn't one of the lessons
we learn at VBS

10:45.061 --> 10:47.146
that we should be thankful
for what we do have?

10:47.229 --> 10:51.692
Hey, let's find a seat, Austin,
and when you're done, you can go play.

10:56.572 --> 10:57.490
Thank you!

11:00.201 --> 11:01.243
Wow!

11:01.327 --> 11:03.329
Your mom really went all-out.

11:03.412 --> 11:06.582
Yeah. Everything's 110% with her
when food's involved.

11:07.083 --> 11:08.918
Did she let <i>you</i> make anything?

11:09.418 --> 11:11.504
I made the ham biscuits.

11:11.587 --> 11:13.798
You should try the ranch wings
because they're amazing.

11:13.881 --> 11:14.840
Mm-hmm.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.677
I can't wait to get dessert!

11:22.473 --> 11:23.933
Come on. Sit down over here.

11:24.016 --> 11:24.850
Hello.

11:24.934 --> 11:26.394
-Hey, that looks good.
-Hi.

11:29.105 --> 11:31.315
Did you see Mark D'Cruz and Jim Frye

11:31.399 --> 11:33.859
got into a fight
outside Wharton's this afternoon?

11:34.694 --> 11:35.695
Really?

11:35.778 --> 11:36.612
Yep.

11:37.238 --> 11:40.700
Yeah. Apparently, Jim pitched a fit
about next year's orchestra program,

11:40.783 --> 11:43.661
so Mark drove off
and left him standing on the sidewalk.

11:43.744 --> 11:44.578
Look.

11:45.287 --> 11:46.747
Why do you think Jackson's here?

11:48.165 --> 11:50.000
Looks like he's getting some snacks.

11:51.502 --> 11:54.839
I thought the one benefit
of no ball this summer was avoiding him.

11:55.339 --> 11:56.257
Here he is.

11:57.258 --> 11:58.634
Being a jerk as always.

12:00.219 --> 12:01.887
Yeah, he's terrible.

12:02.847 --> 12:04.140
Go report him to someone.

12:13.232 --> 12:15.568
Doesn't sound like
you're going to be giving PT

12:15.651 --> 12:17.027
a five-star review on Yelp.

12:17.111 --> 12:18.028
It's the worst.

12:18.612 --> 12:21.866
PT is just some secret sadistic thing
health workers came up with

12:21.949 --> 12:23.993
in order to legally torture patients.

12:24.076 --> 12:26.954
Most of us
don't have that kind of imagination.

12:27.037 --> 12:30.624
I know that it sucks,
but it's really so important.

12:31.208 --> 12:34.420
-Mom, did you tell her to say that?
-No, but you should listen to her.

12:34.503 --> 12:36.756
She's a nurse.
She knows what she's talking about.

12:37.923 --> 12:39.842
I mean, PT is worse
than community service,

12:39.925 --> 12:41.719
and I didn't think that was possible.

12:41.802 --> 12:44.138
At least I'm not picking up trash
by the side of the road.

12:44.221 --> 12:48.184
Yeah. Ew, gross.
I would not wanna be doing that either.

12:48.267 --> 12:49.769
You know, we went on vacation once,

12:49.852 --> 12:51.854
and I accidentally threw
my Darth Vader away.

12:51.937 --> 12:53.898
And, uh…
…some guy who was cleaning up

12:53.981 --> 12:56.400
had to help us
dig through the trash cans to find it.

12:56.484 --> 12:58.652
Yeah, he wasn't too happy about that.

13:01.030 --> 13:02.114
Mom, where was that?

13:02.198 --> 13:04.992
That was down near Jacksonville.

13:05.075 --> 13:06.786
That's right!
We were going to Disney World.

13:06.869 --> 13:09.288
-No, we were going to Daytona.
-Daytona?

13:09.371 --> 13:10.331
How old was I?

13:11.665 --> 13:12.500
You were nine.

13:12.583 --> 13:15.669
Oh yeah. Yeah, that's the trip
when you got sick after you ate oysters.

13:15.753 --> 13:18.130
We do not talk about that night
in this house.

13:19.882 --> 13:23.552
And what was the name of that restaurant?
It had that weird pirate statue.

13:23.636 --> 13:26.472
Mm-hmm. Something to do with prohibition.

13:27.223 --> 13:30.142
Oh, the guy who ran
bootleg alcohol out of his plane!

13:30.226 --> 13:31.727
-Uh-huh.
-You've been there?

13:31.811 --> 13:35.314
My friends and I used to go to Daytona
all the time for spring break.

13:35.397 --> 13:38.359
And we've been to that spot
multiple times. It's called…

13:38.442 --> 13:39.485
It was on the water.

13:39.568 --> 13:41.779
And that little old man!
He was always outside.

13:41.862 --> 13:45.449
-I cannot believe I've forgotten the name.
-It was right there on the glasses.

13:45.533 --> 13:47.701
"Time flies when you're having rum."

13:47.785 --> 13:49.829
-Caribbean Jack's!
-Yes!

13:50.538 --> 13:51.997
That place was awesome!

13:52.081 --> 13:53.624
-Yeah.

13:57.378 --> 13:59.880
Thanks again
for letting me come by, Maddie.

13:59.964 --> 14:02.299
Yeah, well, thanks for cheering him up.

14:03.008 --> 14:04.218
He's a special kid.

14:05.678 --> 14:08.305
I… I have something
that I really need to say.

14:08.389 --> 14:10.599
Um, if I mess it up, I'm sorry

14:10.683 --> 14:13.143
because I tried to figure out
what the right way to say this is.

14:13.227 --> 14:17.523
Still don't know,
but here, now, if I don't just do it…

14:19.066 --> 14:23.654
I'm so sorry
for everything I did to you and your kids.

14:23.737 --> 14:26.031
When I was back home at Mama and Daddy's,

14:26.115 --> 14:27.825
I had a lot of time to think.

14:28.492 --> 14:29.326
A lot.

14:30.911 --> 14:33.038
The one thing I keep coming back to is

14:34.164 --> 14:35.666
I should have known better.

14:36.375 --> 14:37.877
I <i>did</i> know better.

14:38.794 --> 14:40.838
They raised me to know right from wrong,

14:40.921 --> 14:44.550
and sleeping
with another woman's husband is wrong.

14:44.633 --> 14:45.467
Bill is--

14:45.551 --> 14:49.179
You can blame Bill all you want,
but it was my fault too.

14:49.263 --> 14:51.223
I should never have done it.

14:53.100 --> 14:55.978
And, Maddie, I am profoundly sorry

14:56.061 --> 14:58.647
for all of the pain and agony
that I've caused you

14:59.648 --> 15:01.317
and your beautiful children.

15:02.359 --> 15:04.194
No matter what I do or I say,

15:04.278 --> 15:06.655
I know I can't undo ruining your family.

15:07.281 --> 15:09.783
But I want you to know
there's not a day that goes by

15:09.867 --> 15:11.327
that I don't regret what I did.

15:11.410 --> 15:13.245
I just… just pray

15:13.329 --> 15:17.499
that one day you can find it
in your heart to forgive me.

15:33.390 --> 15:34.224
Hi.

15:36.018 --> 15:36.852
Hey!

15:37.519 --> 15:38.979
You came back.

15:40.064 --> 15:41.357
And I made you something.

15:42.691 --> 15:44.610
It's not ham biscuits, but…

15:47.321 --> 15:48.280
It's a camera.

15:55.037 --> 15:55.871
Thank you.

15:59.416 --> 16:00.751
Thank you for seeing me.

16:03.128 --> 16:05.714
What are you two doing out here?
We're starting!

16:11.595 --> 16:14.473
-You're not on the mayor's agenda.
-Nevertheless, we need to talk to him.

16:14.556 --> 16:15.391
It's quite important.

16:15.474 --> 16:16.892
What is so vitally important

16:16.976 --> 16:19.770
you couldn't pick up the phone
and call like civilized adults?

16:19.853 --> 16:24.358
Well, we have some questions for the mayor
about certain goings-on in town.

16:24.441 --> 16:26.568
Things that just don't smell right.

16:26.652 --> 16:30.197
Ladies, the only things
that don't smell right around here

16:30.280 --> 16:31.865
are your fishy allegations.

16:31.949 --> 16:34.743
I won't have you
stinking up this office with lies.

16:34.827 --> 16:35.661
We're not--

16:35.744 --> 16:39.915
I've worked for the mayor,
his daddy, and his granddaddy before him!

16:39.999 --> 16:43.419
Those righteous men have done nothing
but pour their hearts and souls

16:43.502 --> 16:45.796
into doing what's best
for this sweet town of ours.

16:45.879 --> 16:50.300
Were things around here to go catawampus,
he'd be the first to put a stop to it.

16:50.384 --> 16:54.596
-Well, it could be that you don't--
-You are absolutely right, ma'am.

16:54.680 --> 16:58.225
And if something is going wrong,
we should be able to tell him about it

16:58.308 --> 17:00.310
so he can put an end to it.

17:00.394 --> 17:02.521
So if you don't mind,
we're gonna go in there--

17:02.604 --> 17:04.898
Let me be clear!

17:04.982 --> 17:08.360
I don't care if y'all were sent here
by the ghost of my late husband.

17:08.444 --> 17:10.487
May he suffer in torment.

17:10.571 --> 17:13.115
You don't get through those doors
without an appointment.

17:13.198 --> 17:15.034
Fine. Fine!

17:15.117 --> 17:19.872
Could we <i>make</i> an appointment
for today or tomorrow?

17:25.127 --> 17:26.128
What about here? Sorry.

17:26.211 --> 17:28.589
He doesn't have any openings
for the next three months.

17:28.672 --> 17:29.923
Three months?

17:31.467 --> 17:32.301
Three months?

17:32.885 --> 17:34.887
How is he supposed to govern responsibly

17:34.970 --> 17:37.598
if he can't speak
to his constituents for three months?

17:37.681 --> 17:39.558
And I see a lot of golf games on there.

17:39.641 --> 17:41.727
Maybe <i>we</i> need
to book ourselves a tee time.

17:41.810 --> 17:45.355
How the honorable Trent Lewis
chooses to conduct business

17:45.439 --> 17:48.859
on behalf of the good God-fearing people
of Serenity, South Carolina

17:48.942 --> 17:49.985
is his business,

17:50.069 --> 17:51.153
not yours.

17:51.236 --> 17:53.072
My stories is fixing to start.

17:53.572 --> 17:55.115
Show yourselves on out.

18:08.087 --> 18:11.048
I'm telling you, Henrietta knows
that Trent is up to something.

18:11.131 --> 18:13.175
-That's why she wouldn't let us see him.
-Maybe.

18:13.258 --> 18:15.260
-Or maybe she's just mean.

18:15.344 --> 18:17.971
That doesn't have hide nor hair to do
with what Trent's cooking up.

18:18.055 --> 18:22.309
What matters is exposing the Lewises.
People need to know about their schemes.

18:22.392 --> 18:25.896
How? <i>The Sentinel</i> didn't even mention
the meeting at the spa.

18:25.979 --> 18:27.189
Peggy was sitting right there.

18:27.272 --> 18:30.567
Mary Vaughn and Trent are smart.
They got all their bases covered.

18:30.651 --> 18:31.777
So what do we do?

18:31.860 --> 18:32.986
Take 'em out!

18:35.114 --> 18:37.741
Dana Sue, it seems like
you're plotting a coup back there.

18:38.784 --> 18:40.452
I'd follow you three into battle.

18:41.829 --> 18:45.666
A coup would be kinda dramatic.
We could get matching uniforms and--

18:45.749 --> 18:48.377
-Sequined epaulets.
-You know what? That's not a bad idea.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.462
-The sequins or the epaulets?
-The coup.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.757
You see? This is why
I've never tried to crash Margarita Night.

18:54.258 --> 18:56.552
Need to be able to claim
plausible deniability.

18:56.635 --> 18:58.804
Remember Mayor Philip Farrington

18:58.887 --> 19:01.515
from back when we studied
Serenity history in the fourth grade?

19:01.598 --> 19:04.268
Wasn't he that carpetbagger
folks ran out of town

19:04.351 --> 19:06.603
on the back of a mule
before the Depression?

19:06.687 --> 19:08.772
-And how did they do that?
-A recall.

19:08.856 --> 19:10.816
Ah! Bingo!

19:12.067 --> 19:14.820
An election to get him out of office.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.989
Maybe that's what we do to Trent.

19:17.698 --> 19:19.283
He's got so many people mad at him,

19:19.366 --> 19:21.827
folks would probably jump
at the chance to replace him.

19:22.327 --> 19:24.788
Well, it doesn't sound
like sequined epaulets are involved,

19:24.872 --> 19:26.582
but I like everything else.

19:26.665 --> 19:27.499
-Right?
-Yeah.

19:27.583 --> 19:30.002
Let me look at the town charter,
see how we can make it happen.

19:30.085 --> 19:32.045
All right, I hate to interrupt
the revolution here,

19:32.129 --> 19:35.465
but, Maddie, Helen, if you don't mind
taking these to the table

19:35.549 --> 19:36.717
before the kids descend.

19:36.800 --> 19:37.885
Hm.

19:37.968 --> 19:39.678
Should we take the long way back?

19:39.761 --> 19:40.929
Be careful, Dana Sue.

19:41.013 --> 19:45.309
You don't wanna be seen
on Serenity Secrets 415 twice in one week.

19:46.226 --> 19:47.186
I wouldn't mind.

19:49.146 --> 19:50.147
Hm.

19:51.356 --> 19:53.817
-Hi, kids!
-All right, nice!

19:53.901 --> 19:56.653
Here, grab a plate.
Yep, line up. Single file, guys.

19:56.737 --> 19:57.613
There we go.

20:00.115 --> 20:01.617
No dino nuggets again?

20:01.700 --> 20:03.160
They're supposed to be here!

20:03.243 --> 20:04.286
Oh, honey!

20:05.454 --> 20:08.540
I made these from scratch,
special for you.

20:08.624 --> 20:10.751
They're not dino nuggets
like they have at the store.

20:10.834 --> 20:13.754
We don't have any, okay?
But if you just try these--

20:13.837 --> 20:15.964
I… want… dino… nuggets!

20:16.048 --> 20:18.217
Hey. Hey!

20:18.300 --> 20:22.387
Why don't I help you see
what other yummy food we can find?

20:22.471 --> 20:25.182
Yeah? Come on. Sit down here.

20:27.935 --> 20:30.062
Is that boy
trying to get on my last nerve?

20:30.145 --> 20:32.272
The nuggets I made for him are healthier.

20:32.356 --> 20:33.899
And I know he doesn't care about that,

20:33.982 --> 20:36.777
but they taste better too,
if he would just try them!

20:37.277 --> 20:39.571
Isn't that Frank Fletcher's kid?

20:39.655 --> 20:42.407
You know the Fletchers
from over on Ridgeview Way?

20:42.491 --> 20:43.533
Oh, he is!

20:43.617 --> 20:45.994
He's the middle child of five,
and I heard…

20:46.662 --> 20:49.206
-Sorry, Pastor June.

20:49.289 --> 20:51.833
Awareness of people's struggles
is one thing, Lily,

20:51.917 --> 20:55.254
but broadcasting them
is something else altogether.

20:55.337 --> 20:56.421
Yes, ma'am.

21:00.133 --> 21:03.345
Has that boy gone to our church,
and I have missed him every Sunday?

21:03.428 --> 21:07.349
The Fletchers haven't joined yet,
but I'm helping as much as I can.

21:07.432 --> 21:09.101
Well, as much as they'll let me.

21:09.184 --> 21:10.227
Frank's underemployed,

21:10.310 --> 21:12.646
so if you hear anything,
please let me know.

21:12.729 --> 21:14.022
-Of course.
-All right.

21:14.106 --> 21:15.148
Will do. Thank you.

21:17.150 --> 21:19.861
So what's he got
against the nuggets?

21:20.487 --> 21:23.156
I don't think
it's about the… the nugget at all.

21:23.240 --> 21:24.741
I think it's about the dino shape.

21:25.450 --> 21:27.077
Well, why in sam hill would that matter?

21:27.160 --> 21:30.789
I went to school with Frank, and I worked
a couple jobs with his uncle Jack,

21:30.872 --> 21:32.666
so I heard stories.

21:32.749 --> 21:35.335
This might be
the only thing the kid's eating all day.

21:35.419 --> 21:38.922
I can almost guarantee you,
90% of what he's getting at home

21:39.006 --> 21:42.968
is either off-brand, reduced,
or something somebody threw out.

21:43.051 --> 21:44.636
He's not trying to get on your nerves.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.680
He just wants to be
like all the other kids

21:46.763 --> 21:49.641
and have name-brand food
that was bought for him

21:49.725 --> 21:53.061
instead of donated to his family
like an afterthought.

21:53.812 --> 21:56.356
VBS might be
the only place that he gets it.

22:03.280 --> 22:05.115
Sorry it didn't go any better today.

22:05.615 --> 22:06.450
No.

22:07.159 --> 22:09.161
It still hurt.

22:09.244 --> 22:10.704
A lot.

22:13.290 --> 22:14.875
Well, was it a good kinda hurt?

22:15.917 --> 22:16.877
"Good kinda hurt"?

22:17.711 --> 22:21.506
Yeah! Good hurt is what we say
when it's pain that eventually pays off.

22:21.590 --> 22:23.383
In this case, building muscle.

22:23.925 --> 22:26.803
Pain is pain.
I don't see why I have to keep doing this.

22:26.887 --> 22:29.222
This is even worse
than going around on crutches.

22:29.306 --> 22:32.768
Hey, I never told
your brother or mother all of this,

22:32.851 --> 22:35.437
but a few years ago,
I was in a motorcycle accident.

22:35.520 --> 22:36.521
You ride a motorcycle?

22:38.940 --> 22:40.901
-Not anymore.

22:41.693 --> 22:43.820
I crashed. Really bad.

22:44.446 --> 22:47.240
Did a number on myself.
Dislocated my shoulder and broke my leg.

22:47.324 --> 22:49.201
-Ow.
-Yeah, and then some.

22:49.284 --> 22:50.577
Took a long time to recover,

22:50.660 --> 22:53.497
but the only reason I got better
was because I put the work in.

22:53.580 --> 22:56.583
But, man, it hurt.
I can't even describe how much.

22:56.666 --> 22:57.584
Please don't.

22:58.960 --> 23:01.588
Most days, I just wanted to quit,

23:02.464 --> 23:04.466
sit on a beach, and forget all about it.

23:04.549 --> 23:05.509
Why didn't you?

23:05.592 --> 23:08.720
I knew ignoring my problems
would only make them worse.

23:09.221 --> 23:12.391
Because if I didn't bite down
and endure the pain,

23:12.474 --> 23:14.101
my shoulder and leg
would never heal right.

23:14.184 --> 23:16.686
So you're telling me PT is gonna hurt
even more than it does now?

23:16.770 --> 23:19.272
It could, but then it'll get better.

23:19.940 --> 23:20.774
When?

23:20.857 --> 23:22.192
Doesn't work like that.

23:23.318 --> 23:27.447
Maybe your mom won't like me saying this,
but I think you're old enough to hear it.

23:27.531 --> 23:28.490
Life

23:29.991 --> 23:30.992
is full of pain.

23:32.244 --> 23:35.080
Physical, emotional, mental, spiritual.

23:35.163 --> 23:36.081
Take your pick.

23:36.832 --> 23:38.917
And no matter how much you want to,

23:40.127 --> 23:41.169
you can't avoid it.

23:41.670 --> 23:42.754
You can quit PT

23:42.838 --> 23:45.298
and try to walk around on crutches
the rest of your life,

23:45.382 --> 23:47.300
but there will be one day,

23:47.968 --> 23:49.761
one play, one girl,

23:49.845 --> 23:53.348
something that will make you wish
that your leg and knee were strong.

23:54.683 --> 23:56.518
But by then, it'll be too late.

23:57.519 --> 24:01.356
Because you made the decision,
here and now, to take the easy way out.

24:06.987 --> 24:08.864
Is that really what you wanna do?

24:23.670 --> 24:28.425
Would you like to be song leader tonight?
My throat's, um, a little scratchy.

24:28.508 --> 24:29.634
Yes! Please!

24:29.718 --> 24:32.971
I… I mean, I should probably look over
the songs for just a moment.

24:33.054 --> 24:36.266
Why don't <i>you</i> go with Pastor June?
I think I can handle greetin'.

24:37.893 --> 24:38.894
Thank you, Peggy.

24:39.519 --> 24:41.771
I loved being the song leader
when I was her age.

24:41.855 --> 24:45.317
I didn't know that!
Should we be coaxing you into choir?

24:45.400 --> 24:48.236
-Oh, that moment may have passed.
-We'll talk.

24:53.992 --> 24:55.243
Good evening, Peggy.

24:56.328 --> 24:57.162
How are you?

24:57.662 --> 25:00.165
Uh, well, Helen,
this week has been wonderful.

25:00.248 --> 25:05.545
I've had 15 kids in my class each session,
and we've just been learning a lot.

25:05.629 --> 25:08.548
Hm. And Maddie says
that Katie's raved about your class.

25:08.632 --> 25:10.425
-Oh good!
-Hm.

25:13.345 --> 25:14.262
I truly meant,

25:15.680 --> 25:16.973
how are <i>you</i> doing?

25:22.687 --> 25:24.648
You once told me that, uh,

25:25.732 --> 25:29.819
we've never been close friends,
and you're right about that.

25:31.112 --> 25:32.405
But we are neighbors,

25:33.073 --> 25:34.908
sisters in Christ, and…

25:37.202 --> 25:38.328
that means something.

25:39.663 --> 25:42.624
I know you have your family
and, uh, Mary Vaughn,

25:43.833 --> 25:44.709
June,

25:45.669 --> 25:47.629
many other confidantes you can talk to,

25:47.712 --> 25:52.592
but sometimes it's easier
to speak about difficult things

25:52.676 --> 25:54.594
with people you're not close to.

25:56.596 --> 25:57.722
I'm here for that…

26:00.267 --> 26:01.268
if you need me.

26:05.230 --> 26:06.231
God bless you.

26:18.785 --> 26:20.245
All it takes for a recall

26:20.328 --> 26:24.457
is for 20% of registered town voters
to sign the statement of disagreement.

26:24.541 --> 26:25.667
How dope is that?

26:32.090 --> 26:34.301
And then parking meters
come up from the ground

26:34.384 --> 26:36.386
and kidnap all the baseball players.

26:40.098 --> 26:43.351
Have you listened to anything I've said
about what Miss Helen and I researched?

26:43.435 --> 26:44.811
How is no one seeing his act?

26:46.104 --> 26:47.981
-Why do you care?
-Because it's Jackson, and he--

26:48.064 --> 26:50.817
He's all the way over there, okay?
Not harassing you at all.

26:50.900 --> 26:51.776
So what's the big--

26:51.860 --> 26:53.612
So I'm sitting here trying to talk,

26:53.695 --> 26:55.655
and all you wanna do
is complain about Jackson.

26:55.739 --> 26:57.240
Yeah, he's… he's a bad guy!

26:57.324 --> 27:00.452
-Why are you hung up on Jackson?
-I… I'm not! Look at him! Annie--

27:00.535 --> 27:01.411
Annie what?

27:04.456 --> 27:06.666
She should be hanging out
with someone better than that!

27:08.877 --> 27:09.711
Yeah.

27:11.546 --> 27:12.589
Shouldn't we all.

27:17.093 --> 27:18.345
-Hey.
-What?

27:19.846 --> 27:21.264
Should we tell her dad?

27:23.558 --> 27:24.684
Is his sister here?

27:24.768 --> 27:25.602
No.

27:26.227 --> 27:27.604
He's only here because of…

27:37.238 --> 27:38.156
Kyle.

27:38.948 --> 27:41.368
Thanks again for all your help on this.

27:41.451 --> 27:45.080
It's been a true blessing
to have you working so hard on our behalf.

27:45.163 --> 27:47.707
-Sure. I mean, you're… you're welcome.

27:47.791 --> 27:48.708
Well…

27:51.920 --> 27:52.754
Okay.

27:53.755 --> 27:54.881
June, hey!

27:54.964 --> 27:58.009
I really appreciate you letting me help
with refreshments this week.

27:58.093 --> 28:00.095
It has been special.

28:00.178 --> 28:02.472
Grateful to have you
be a part of this, Dana Sue.

28:02.555 --> 28:03.682
Dino nuggets!

28:07.644 --> 28:08.645
Excuse me.

28:10.021 --> 28:12.732
Hey! Wanna set that down
for a second and come with me?

28:13.942 --> 28:15.985
I promise, no one will take it.

28:17.153 --> 28:19.072
I'll hold it for you, Austin.

28:20.323 --> 28:22.492
-Don't take any.
-I promise.

28:23.034 --> 28:23.910
Come here.

28:28.623 --> 28:30.583
These are for you.

28:32.669 --> 28:35.672
You come see me when VBS is over,
and I'll pack 'em up for you, okay?

28:35.755 --> 28:36.965
Also, look at this.

28:38.091 --> 28:42.554
Veg tots, broccoli, raspberries, melon,

28:42.637 --> 28:44.389
all for you to take home, okay?

28:44.472 --> 28:47.934
And this is a gift certificate
to Sullivan's, okay?

28:48.017 --> 28:49.561
Give this to your mom and dad.

28:49.644 --> 28:52.021
Y'all can come into the restaurant
any time you want.

28:52.105 --> 28:54.190
Also, it has my phone number on it, okay?

28:54.274 --> 28:56.735
So whenever you get a hankering
for those dino nuggets,

28:56.818 --> 28:58.069
you just call me,

28:58.153 --> 29:01.114
and I will stop whatever I'm doing
and make 'em for you.

29:01.197 --> 29:02.365
I love VBS.

29:03.450 --> 29:04.409
And I love you.

29:05.493 --> 29:06.494
Aw.

29:12.041 --> 29:14.502
Done a lot of work back here.
It's impressive.

29:14.586 --> 29:17.088
Thanks! Still not sure
it's quite right though.

29:17.922 --> 29:20.175
Well, that's the thing about a garden.

29:20.967 --> 29:22.427
It can grow and change.

29:22.510 --> 29:24.471
You don't have to get
everything right all at once.

29:24.554 --> 29:26.306
Well, that's good to know.

29:27.056 --> 29:28.183
The last few days…

29:31.895 --> 29:33.271
And we've been missing you.

29:35.690 --> 29:36.983
Any chance you wanna

29:37.859 --> 29:39.486
share what's been going on?

29:42.197 --> 29:44.032
Peggy Martin's my birth mother.

29:44.657 --> 29:45.867
That's a lot to take in.

29:48.161 --> 29:49.120
How you feeling?

29:49.746 --> 29:50.622
Confused.

29:52.499 --> 29:54.959
I've dreamt of this moment
going really well.

29:55.877 --> 29:58.004
I've worried about it going really poorly.

29:59.839 --> 30:02.091
But I never really imagined
that it would just

30:02.884 --> 30:03.718
melt.

30:03.802 --> 30:06.554
She wasn't ready at all.

30:08.139 --> 30:09.265
I can imagine.

30:10.517 --> 30:11.351
So,

30:12.018 --> 30:13.061
what's next?

30:14.312 --> 30:17.524
I may get some of these tiered planters
for the corner over there.

30:17.607 --> 30:19.442
See if I can get
some tomato plants out here.

30:19.526 --> 30:23.279
I don't think tomato plants
are gonna fix your problem.

30:25.323 --> 30:29.285
We've discussed how baking got me
out of a funk when a family member passed.

30:29.369 --> 30:30.745
I appreciate you sharing that.

30:30.829 --> 30:34.541
What I haven't told you is how long
it took me to get into the kitchen.

30:36.334 --> 30:38.628
After the funeral, I was a mess.

30:39.128 --> 30:41.339
Didn't get out of bed, didn't shave.

30:41.923 --> 30:43.675
My life stopped.

30:45.260 --> 30:47.011
Actually, that's not true.

30:48.137 --> 30:49.347
My life didn't stop.

30:50.223 --> 30:51.641
I simply stopped living.

30:51.724 --> 30:55.353
I'm still trying to find
and revive those parts of myself.

30:56.521 --> 30:57.981
Bring them back to life.

30:58.064 --> 30:59.941
I don't wanna see that happen to you.

31:00.775 --> 31:02.402
Well, what do you think I should do?

31:02.902 --> 31:05.446
Now this next piece of road
is gonna be scary

31:06.364 --> 31:07.365
and hard.

31:08.575 --> 31:09.742
No escaping that.

31:11.494 --> 31:13.288
But you gotta keep moving forward

31:13.371 --> 31:16.583
with a hope and a prayer
that things will turn out for the best.

31:17.083 --> 31:20.712
And I'm staring down
some uncertainty myself, so I sympathize.

31:21.337 --> 31:23.172
But I got your back if you got mine.

31:23.256 --> 31:24.299
Anytime.

31:27.844 --> 31:29.387
You know,

31:30.847 --> 31:34.684
I just thought of something
that might be good for the both of us.

31:35.935 --> 31:38.438
Always good to see you. Have a good night.

31:52.327 --> 31:53.161
Hello?

31:55.371 --> 31:56.497
Um…

31:56.581 --> 31:58.499
Something happened tonight, and

31:59.834 --> 32:01.127
I really need to see you.

32:03.755 --> 32:04.589
Please.

32:05.882 --> 32:09.177
Think I have that loaves and fishes song
stuck in my head now.

32:09.677 --> 32:12.138
It'll go away… in, like, a week.

32:12.221 --> 32:13.681
-Oh no!

32:13.765 --> 32:16.309
Oh, we should've grabbed you
one of those souvenir backpacks.

32:16.392 --> 32:18.686
Ah, yeah. Well, it's quite all right.

32:20.772 --> 32:22.815
Thanks for coming this week.

32:23.441 --> 32:26.527
I know that Lily already told you,
um, that we were happy you came,

32:26.611 --> 32:29.447
but I hope you learned stuff,

32:29.530 --> 32:31.491
and if you ever wanna come back--

32:31.574 --> 32:34.452
I didn't come for the Bible part.

32:34.535 --> 32:37.497
I mean, it's fine,
but I can get that at my church.

32:38.247 --> 32:39.082
Then,

32:39.791 --> 32:41.250
why did you come?

32:41.334 --> 32:42.710
I think you know.

32:44.587 --> 32:45.421
No.

32:48.716 --> 32:50.677
I came to get to know you.

32:51.552 --> 32:53.846
To spend as much time as I could with you.

32:57.058 --> 32:59.060
If I've got my signals crossed, I'll go.

32:59.143 --> 33:00.728
But I think you knew all that,

33:01.479 --> 33:03.314
and I think you feel the same way.

33:04.399 --> 33:05.233
Don't you?

33:07.318 --> 33:08.152
Yes.

33:33.136 --> 33:34.012
Hey.

33:35.722 --> 33:36.723
Oh my goodness!

33:36.806 --> 33:40.727
Maddie and Cal are on their way.
We don't need them to say happy birthday!

33:40.810 --> 33:43.563
-Thank you. Thank you for coming.
-Happy birthday.

33:43.646 --> 33:46.524
It has been a minute
since I've been at a bar besides mine.

33:46.607 --> 33:49.902
-I'm happy to celebrate you!
-Thank you.

33:49.986 --> 33:52.363
I, uh… I thought that Erik said
he was gonna be here.

33:52.447 --> 33:55.241
Well, Helen Decatur,
I think I found a gap in your talents!

33:55.324 --> 33:56.159
What's that?

33:56.242 --> 33:59.370
You are not meant to be a spy
unless you carefully survey

33:59.454 --> 34:01.164
all of your surroundings.

34:01.247 --> 34:03.374
-Oh!
-Yes.

34:07.837 --> 34:08.671
Yes.

34:27.565 --> 34:28.691
One night off.

34:34.781 --> 34:37.158
Are they doing this
of their own free will?

34:37.241 --> 34:41.287
I didn't force them to go up there.
Might have to force them to come down.

34:43.748 --> 34:44.999
Okay, I got enough of this.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.335
You know what?
Let's turn this bad boy up to 11.

34:47.418 --> 34:49.504
-Helen Decatur!
-Let's turn it. You know I can.

34:49.587 --> 34:50.963
-Are you really?
-You know I--

34:51.047 --> 34:53.466
Serenity Show Choir, let's do this.
Come on, babies!

34:53.549 --> 34:55.885
So it wasn't weird
having Noreen in your house?

34:56.594 --> 34:58.137
Not until she went to leave.

34:58.221 --> 35:01.557
That's when she apologized to me
for having the affair

35:01.641 --> 35:03.142
and asked me to forgive her.

35:04.685 --> 35:05.520
Wow!

35:07.230 --> 35:08.231
What did you say?

35:08.940 --> 35:09.774
Nothing.

35:10.483 --> 35:13.694
Just sat there
like a june bug in a bug zapper.

35:15.613 --> 35:17.115
Well, what did you wanna say?

35:22.411 --> 35:24.247
I know what I'm supposed to say.

35:25.081 --> 35:26.374
Seventy times seven.

35:29.335 --> 35:34.132
But she and Bill ruined my life.

35:35.258 --> 35:37.093
They ruined the kids' lives.

35:37.635 --> 35:41.973
I mean, how am I just supposed to move on
and forget that didn't happen?

35:42.056 --> 35:44.267
How am I supposed
to just forgive and forget?

35:45.226 --> 35:46.936
You have every right to be angry.

35:47.019 --> 35:48.688
Believe me, I am.

35:48.771 --> 35:52.775
And if you wanna hold on to that anger,
nobody is going to fault you, but…

35:54.944 --> 35:55.903
at what cost?

35:55.987 --> 35:58.865
That's what worries me.
What's this doing to the kids?

35:58.948 --> 35:59.824
Maddie,

36:01.242 --> 36:02.535
this is about you.

36:02.618 --> 36:04.704
What holding on is doing to you.

36:06.414 --> 36:09.917
One of the things I love most about you
is how gracious you are.

36:10.001 --> 36:13.379
I don't wanna see the weight of this
destroy that part of you

36:13.462 --> 36:17.925
or your goodness or your sincerity
or any part of you, for that matter.

36:19.802 --> 36:22.263
How am I supposed to just let it all go?

36:23.764 --> 36:25.016
I don't know.

36:25.766 --> 36:28.978
I'm always telling my players
to be the bigger person,

36:29.478 --> 36:31.606
but when someone destroys your world

36:33.065 --> 36:37.236
and ruins everything
that you thought you knew to the point…

36:39.322 --> 36:43.201
where you doubt yourself
and don't know who you are anymore,

36:43.284 --> 36:47.997
I sure as hell don't know
how to pretend like that never happened.

36:50.875 --> 36:54.754
The best I got figured is
don't hold onto the hurt.

36:54.837 --> 36:55.796
Every minute,

36:56.881 --> 36:57.715
try to let go.

36:57.798 --> 36:59.759
Every day, try to let go. And then,

37:01.219 --> 37:03.221
one morning, you'll wake up,

37:04.430 --> 37:05.431
and that weight…

37:08.226 --> 37:10.144
won't be the first thing you think of.

37:13.231 --> 37:14.398
And I'm hoping

37:15.608 --> 37:18.819
that that's the day
you'll finally be able to forgive.

37:26.619 --> 37:29.580
Come on. We're here to celebrate, right?

37:30.331 --> 37:32.041
-Right.
-Mm-hmm.

37:54.855 --> 37:55.982
-Hello!
-Hi!

38:11.539 --> 38:12.581
What else have I missed?

38:12.665 --> 38:13.541
Holy moly.

38:13.624 --> 38:15.501
-I don't even know where to start.
-Oh!

38:15.584 --> 38:18.462
If they get much hotter,
I'm hunting for a fire extinguisher.

38:47.491 --> 38:49.744
-Oh! Oh!

38:49.827 --> 38:52.079
-Come on, man.

39:02.131 --> 39:04.592
I'm going to the bar.
Either of you want something?

39:04.675 --> 39:08.387
-I think this calls for an Aviation.
-It does. I think they've had…

39:08.471 --> 39:10.014
I'll have whatever they're having.

39:22.985 --> 39:23.819
Thank you.

39:24.403 --> 39:28.240
Two Aviations for the birthday table,
and I'll have a Macallan neat, please.

39:31.911 --> 39:33.537
Sorry I called out sick.

39:33.621 --> 39:36.082
Isaac. Everything you've been through,

39:36.165 --> 39:38.751
you take all the time you need
to get back on track.

39:38.834 --> 39:40.461
Thank you.

39:40.544 --> 39:42.171
I'm glad to see you out tonight.

39:42.797 --> 39:44.924
It was Erik's idea, but it's fun!

39:45.549 --> 39:48.177
It's good to focus on something else.

39:48.260 --> 39:49.512
Yeah, I'm sure.

39:50.429 --> 39:52.640
Uh, you're really good.

39:54.558 --> 39:55.601
Thank you.

39:55.684 --> 39:57.978
It's a really random reminder…

39:59.438 --> 40:01.982
You know, things might
seem crazy right now,

40:02.066 --> 40:06.404
but we are looking for adventure
and whatever comes our way.

40:08.155 --> 40:09.281
We are indeed.

40:14.161 --> 40:16.747
Isaac, Beastie Boys!

40:17.415 --> 40:21.293
Excuse me. Apparently,
"No Sleep Till… Castlewood"!

40:49.196 --> 40:52.283
Oh, you know, it's a shame
you two aren't enjoying yourselves.

40:54.326 --> 40:55.369
It's good to see you, Chef.

40:55.453 --> 40:57.955
You don't have to call me Chef here,
rock star.

40:58.038 --> 41:01.417
Oh, that was so much fun!

41:01.500 --> 41:04.879
Dana Sue, you really should think about
doing some karaoke at Sullivan's.

41:04.962 --> 41:07.715
Absolutely not.
We would never get anyone fed

41:07.798 --> 41:11.218
because my kitchen staff
would be rotating through the spotlight.

41:11.302 --> 41:12.261
It's true!

41:15.097 --> 41:16.891
-I'm gonna get another beer.
-Hm.

41:16.974 --> 41:17.975
What's your poison?

41:18.058 --> 41:19.477
Oh, um…

41:20.019 --> 41:21.687
A club soda with a lime.

41:21.770 --> 41:22.771
-Hm.
-Yeah.

41:22.855 --> 41:24.940
-All right, then.
-Thank you.

41:30.112 --> 41:30.946
What?

41:31.447 --> 41:33.449
What are you trying to say, Dana Sue?

41:33.532 --> 41:35.451
Well, I didn't say a word.

41:35.534 --> 41:37.661
Your eyebrows are speaking volumes.

41:37.745 --> 41:39.580
Well, maybe it's not what she has to say.

41:39.663 --> 41:41.832
-It's about what you have to tell us.
-Mm-hmm.

41:41.916 --> 41:44.752
If we have to get margaritas
and pour it out right here, we will.

41:44.835 --> 41:47.046
I do not know
what you two are talking about.

41:47.129 --> 41:49.089
-That song?
-The heat.

41:49.173 --> 41:50.674
-The passion.

41:50.758 --> 41:52.843
The… …the passion.

41:55.804 --> 41:57.890
-Erik and I are just friends.
-Oh, sure.

41:57.973 --> 42:01.018
I actually distinctly remember
someone once telling me

42:01.101 --> 42:05.314
that it is impossible
to be just friends with a man like that.

42:05.397 --> 42:07.775
That was not just friendship
up on that stage.

42:07.858 --> 42:11.028
You certainly have given us
something to talk about.

42:11.111 --> 42:12.571
You two are crazy.

42:35.678 --> 42:37.179
-Hi.
-Hi.

42:37.263 --> 42:40.808
Morning came sooner
than I even knew was possible.

42:40.891 --> 42:43.394
I don't know
if it's the teacher in me or what,

42:43.477 --> 42:45.938
but I cannot hang out
on a school night anymore.

42:46.021 --> 42:48.190
Especially since school
is no longer in session?

42:48.274 --> 42:49.149
Touché.

42:50.359 --> 42:54.488
You wanna come in? I can offer you
some coffee, Advil, maybe a nap?

42:56.365 --> 42:59.243
Actually, Mom,
your boyfriend's not here for you.

42:59.326 --> 43:01.620
He finally realized
I'm the cool one in the family.

43:01.704 --> 43:02.746
Oh, he did?

43:02.830 --> 43:04.415
He thinks I'm really a theater kinda guy.

43:04.498 --> 43:06.166
One step at a time, right?

43:06.250 --> 43:08.544
And don't worry.
I'll bring him back after we take a walk

43:08.627 --> 43:09.878
so I can get my exercise.

43:09.962 --> 43:12.006
Exercise? Are you sure?

43:12.089 --> 43:14.758
-It's part of my program.
-I don't want you to overdo it.

43:14.842 --> 43:17.553
I won't, but life is full of pain.

43:18.137 --> 43:19.430
And you can't avoid it.

43:19.513 --> 43:20.806
That's a little bleak.

43:20.889 --> 43:23.809
I've got work to do, Mom,
and I'm not gonna take the easy way out.

43:25.519 --> 43:26.437
Okay.

43:28.856 --> 43:30.149
-Mm.

43:30.232 --> 43:33.110
-Are we going, or we yammering?
-Let's go.

43:41.493 --> 43:42.870
Come slide with me!

43:43.912 --> 43:45.748
I can't. I'm too big. I'll break it.

43:50.210 --> 43:52.379
What time are CeCe and all them
supposed to be here?

43:52.963 --> 43:53.881
Ten.

43:53.964 --> 43:55.507
What time is it now?

43:56.675 --> 43:57.926
10:15.

44:00.763 --> 44:02.097
Well, where are they?

44:10.856 --> 44:13.400
Well, goodness, Helen.
Are you challenging me to a duel?

44:13.484 --> 44:14.902
This, my dear,

44:14.985 --> 44:18.155
is a signature sheet for the petition
asking for Trent's recall.

44:18.238 --> 44:19.698
Maddie emailed it to us this morning.

44:19.782 --> 44:21.992
So if we collect enough signatures,

44:22.076 --> 44:25.704
we then get to vote
on whether to remove Trent from office.

44:25.788 --> 44:27.122
-How many do we need?

44:27.206 --> 44:28.165
Three thousand.

44:33.462 --> 44:34.463
That's one.

44:36.131 --> 44:37.132
Who's number two?

44:38.092 --> 44:39.134
Oh!

44:40.636 --> 44:41.553
Here we go.

44:43.555 --> 44:45.974
Hey. Do you have a moment?

44:46.058 --> 44:47.101
Mm-hmm.

44:54.608 --> 44:57.027
-I so enjoyed last night.

44:57.111 --> 45:01.657
I need to make sure that it wasn't
your clone I was on stage with.

45:01.740 --> 45:02.574
Oh, right.

45:02.658 --> 45:06.412
-And we didn't even get to my dance moves.
-Show me now.

45:06.495 --> 45:08.580
Oh no. Absolutely not!

45:11.625 --> 45:14.795
Ah, you're a man of many secrets,
Erik Whitley.

45:15.713 --> 45:20.092
I prefer to think of it
as being selective whom I share with.

45:24.680 --> 45:27.891
Oh, did I just leave
the great Helen Decatur speechless?

45:27.975 --> 45:30.144
-I didn't think that was possible.

45:30.227 --> 45:31.562
Ah.

45:38.652 --> 45:42.281
I meant everything I said
about how much I cherish our friendship.

45:43.282 --> 45:46.535
In a town full of people
who mean the world to me, you…

45:46.618 --> 45:51.123
you are quickly becoming
the one I look forward to seeing the most.

45:51.999 --> 45:53.250
I feel the same way.

45:53.917 --> 45:56.837
I don't have to hide
how… how messed up and… and…

45:58.088 --> 45:59.590
and imperfect I am.

45:59.673 --> 46:00.549
Not at all.

46:01.717 --> 46:02.551
You,

46:03.218 --> 46:04.052
me,

46:04.678 --> 46:06.972
and everybody in this town, we're all

46:07.931 --> 46:08.766
broken,

46:10.017 --> 46:11.143
falling short,

46:11.226 --> 46:13.479
and striving to find our way forward.

46:16.023 --> 46:16.940
Well, then…

46:20.778 --> 46:23.572
then let's see
if we can try to do that together.

46:26.033 --> 46:31.413
I know that I… I said
that I didn't wanna risk our friendship,

46:31.497 --> 46:34.708
but that implies that I don't want
our friendship to change.

46:35.209 --> 46:36.126
And, um…

46:39.129 --> 46:40.047
and I do.

46:41.673 --> 46:43.091
So you don't wanna

46:44.009 --> 46:45.427
just be friends?

46:52.142 --> 46:57.773
I wanna explore everything
that we could mean to each other.

47:00.984 --> 47:02.986
Could that be something that you'd want?

47:03.487 --> 47:04.863
That's all I've wanted,

47:05.864 --> 47:07.282
for a very long time.

47:08.033 --> 47:09.493
I was just waiting…

47:11.495 --> 47:12.538
and hoping

47:13.664 --> 47:15.123
for you to want it too.

47:19.670 --> 47:20.754
Oh…

47:21.630 --> 47:22.464
Um…

47:23.215 --> 47:25.467
There's just one last thing.

47:27.928 --> 47:29.179
Cards on the table.

47:30.264 --> 47:31.181
No secrets.

47:32.850 --> 47:33.684
I, um…

47:34.852 --> 47:37.604
I made an appointment
to see a doctor in Charleston.

47:39.356 --> 47:41.733
I'm gonna do IVF to have a baby.

47:41.817 --> 47:45.279
I know this is
not the most romantic prelude

47:45.362 --> 47:46.780
to a relationship,

47:46.864 --> 47:49.116
and if it's something
that you're uncomfortable with,

47:49.199 --> 47:51.660
I… I completely understand.

47:52.202 --> 47:54.162
I won't… I won't be upset,

47:54.246 --> 47:58.083
and I won't hold it against you, but, um…

48:01.461 --> 48:02.421
I need to know.

48:08.385 --> 48:09.219
Okay.

48:11.054 --> 48:11.972
No secrets.

48:12.055 --> 48:13.015
No secrets.

48:16.018 --> 48:17.895
There's something I need to tell you.

48:24.151 --> 48:25.819
Noreen, have you seen my wallet?

48:27.487 --> 48:28.947
I thought it was on the…

48:35.871 --> 48:38.999
Oh. All right. I gotta dip,
or I'm gonna be late for work.

48:39.082 --> 48:40.876
Can I ask you one quick favor?

48:42.502 --> 48:43.712
Yeah, sure.

48:43.795 --> 48:46.381
On your way,
can you drop me off at the hospital?

48:47.215 --> 48:48.258
I'm in labor.
