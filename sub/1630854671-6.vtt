Hey? I've been robbed. Holy shit.

00:08.300 --> 00:11.100
Our new doctor was brutal
about our chances of conceiving.

00:11.140 --> 00:14.940
I've got your money. I've decided
I ain't gonna give you anything.

00:17.060 --> 00:19.940
Allison, fill up the bag!
There's way more than 500g.

00:19.980 --> 00:22.220
Go home, pack our shit,
we get out of here.

00:22.260 --> 00:24.860
You're acting weird.
You acted like this before.

00:24.900 --> 00:28.180
Es, I don't have time for this. Can
I have a quick chat with you both?

00:28.220 --> 00:29.740
Oi! I know you took that money!

00:29.780 --> 00:32.740
Why don't both of you
make yourselves comfortable?

00:32.780 --> 00:36.140
I'll be back with the police.
I'm going to piss on Alfie's chair.

00:36.180 --> 00:40.740
Not pregnant. Kethan's gonna come
looking for us, so Esme's in danger.

00:40.780 --> 00:43.140
I'm afraid Allison and Deacon
are at work. Can I help?

00:43.180 --> 00:44.940
I've come for my $1 million.

00:50.580 --> 00:54.060
Deacon, we need to go. What's the
point? It's all been for nothing.

00:54.100 --> 00:56.820
There is an alarm going off,
which, whilst attracting

00:56.860 --> 00:59.700
police attention,
is also annoying the shit out of me.

00:59.740 --> 01:02.260
So I, for one,
would like to get out of here.

01:02.300 --> 01:04.460
Maybe I would prefer to get caught,
actually.

01:04.500 --> 01:08.140
Are you kidding me, Deacon?
We're on the run, so run!

01:15.100 --> 01:18.660
It's not that I don't trust
a man that is clearly bleeding

01:18.700 --> 01:22.540
on the doorframe, I genuinely
don't know where they are.

01:22.580 --> 01:26.380
That's weird, because you literally
just told me they were at work.

01:26.420 --> 01:30.060
Did I? Well, yeah, there you go.
That's where they are.

01:31.020 --> 01:34.500
If it's alright with you, darling,
maybe I can wait here for them.

01:34.540 --> 01:38.260
No, darling, it's not alright.
You can wait outside.

01:38.300 --> 01:40.700
You'll be a while,
my sister works really late.

01:42.700 --> 01:44.620

a little bit? No.

02:17.060 --> 02:18.500
Why wouldn't I be?

02:19.420 --> 02:22.620
No reason. Oh, gosh,
sorry we took so long at work.

02:22.660 --> 02:25.660
It was, like, a mess over there.
It's fine.

02:25.700 --> 02:27.500
You on your own, are you? Yep.

02:27.540 --> 02:29.260
Just me.

02:29.300 --> 02:32.700
Why, were you expecting someone?
No. I mean, no, God no.

02:32.740 --> 02:34.860
Why would we be expecting someone?
No.

02:35.860 --> 02:37.780
Cool.Cool.

02:37.820 --> 02:41.340
Yeah, cool.
So, it's really, very cool.

03:28.220 --> 03:29.580
it didn't work.

03:30.700 --> 03:34.940
As of per, I am not pregnant.

03:34.980 --> 03:36.900
I'm so sorry.

03:36.940 --> 03:38.580
Come here.

03:38.620 --> 03:40.620
I'm so, so sorry. That sucks.

03:42.220 --> 03:43.660
Yeah.

03:46.260 --> 03:47.940
Allison?

03:47.980 --> 03:49.740
Yeah?

03:49.780 --> 03:51.100
Who the fuck is Kethan,

03:51.140 --> 03:53.900
why is there a giant bag of cash
on top of your wardrobe?

03:53.940 --> 03:57.460
You always go through my stuff!
You're leaving again.

03:57.500 --> 03:59.980
No baby, nothing to keep you here.
You're leaving.

04:00.020 --> 04:04.060
You're taking that Kethan's money
and you're running away again.
Again?

04:04.100 --> 04:06.500
What does she mean again?
Can you explain it again?

04:06.540 --> 04:09.180
Again? It's not that complicated.

04:09.220 --> 04:11.940
My firm is being investigated, yeah?

04:11.980 --> 04:17.020

to get all this down, yeah?

What? You'll be wanting
to get the information down.

04:22.900 --> 04:24.100

Then, I remembered I had
all the files backed up

on this USB stick, yeah?

04:30.620 --> 04:32.100

Turns out that lying toe-rag had
been funnelling money off for years.

04:36.420 --> 04:39.380
I was shocked, and devastated.

04:39.420 --> 04:41.620
Get that down. Devastated. Yeah?

04:41.660 --> 04:44.460
And I had absolutely no idea that
what was going on

04:44.500 --> 04:47.500
even though it was
right under my nose.

you're taking this seriously.

to an investigating officer.

I just work on reception.

05:19.260 --> 05:22.060
I can explain. Explain what?
What does she always do?

05:22.100 --> 05:24.700
No need to. It's Jackson all
over again. What is Jackson?

05:24.740 --> 05:27.620
This is completely different.
Is Jackson a place or a person?

05:27.660 --> 05:31.460
You say you're here for me,
you want to make my life better,
but it's all bullshit.

05:31.500 --> 05:34.740
It's not! Esme, I looked
after you from five years old.

05:34.780 --> 05:37.660
I'll never let you down. Except for
when you ran off and left me.

05:37.700 --> 05:39.500
Is Jackson in Canada? Shut up.

05:39.540 --> 05:41.820
I left you with more than enough
money to get by.

05:41.860 --> 05:44.420
I didn't want the money,
I wanted my sister.

05:48.860 --> 05:49.940
So come with us.

but it's my home,

07:31.740 --> 07:33.700
I don't know who they are. Really?

07:33.740 --> 07:36.820

so now I know you're a liar.

but more importantly,

08:04.460 --> 08:06.620
they stole money from me,

08:06.660 --> 08:08.300
so here is what we're gonna do.

08:08.340 --> 08:12.460
You're gonna tell me everything
you know, we're gonna find them.

08:12.500 --> 08:16.300
And after I've got them,
we'll take our money back.

12:09.960 --> 12:12.600
We've got a plane to catch,
if you wouldn't mind putting

12:12.640 --> 12:17.120
your foot down, that would be great.
Not a problem.Thanks.

12:17.160 --> 12:19.760
Excuse me, it doesn't seem
like you've accelerated.

12:19.800 --> 12:22.120
I assure you, I have.
I can see the speedometer.

12:22.160 --> 12:24.120
It's still on 30.
We will make the flight.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.720
Fucks sake, we're being chased,
you fuck knuckle! Go!

12:26.760 --> 12:29.960
Fucking idiot, put your foot down,
for fucks sake! Go on!

12:32.040 --> 12:33.800
They've gone round, they've gone!

12:33.840 --> 12:36.080
Turn the car round,
turn the car round!

12:36.120 --> 12:38.360
OK, I can't
when you're yelling at me!

12:40.080 --> 12:41.560
Out. What?

12:41.600 --> 12:43.600
Are you insane? This isn't Die Hard.

12:43.640 --> 12:45.880
You can't make taxi drivers
a getaway vehicle.

12:45.920 --> 12:47.680
The train station's close.
Let's run.

12:47.720 --> 12:51.160
There's no taxi in Die Hard.
It's a limo, you prick.

12:51.200 --> 12:53.440
Have you seen Die Hard 3?
Well, say Die Hard 3.

12:53.480 --> 12:57.280
Die Hard 3. Watch more movies.
Leaving the boot open, twat!

12:57.320 --> 12:58.480
You're a prick!

12:58.520 --> 13:01.360
Did you really have to bring
two massive suitcases?

13:01.400 --> 13:04.800
I am sorry that I cannot pack light
for the rest of my entire life.

13:04.840 --> 13:06.240
(TYRES SCREECH)

13:11.400 --> 13:14.440
Just leave the bag.
Oh, I'm so glad we brought these.

13:14.480 --> 13:16.840
What's this, the great escape?
Sorry, mate.

13:16.880 --> 13:19.680
You need more gym time, mate.
Shut up, mate.

13:19.720 --> 13:21.560
Quick, quick, quick, quick!

13:23.000 --> 13:24.200
Oi!

13:24.240 --> 13:25.600
(TRAIN DOORS BEEP)

13:26.520 --> 13:28.800
Go on, quick, quick, quick, quick!

13:30.360 --> 13:31.480
(SCREAMS)

13:34.560 --> 13:35.760
Yes!

13:35.800 --> 13:38.560
You did it! Yes! Sorry.

13:45.880 --> 13:47.280
(PANTS)

13:51.240 --> 13:54.160
Nearly had them. Oh yeah,
given another half an hour

13:54.200 --> 13:57.800
you would have caught up with all
of us. So, what's the plan?

13:57.840 --> 14:01.040
I'm afraid, virgin,
this is the end of the road for you.

14:01.080 --> 14:04.160
What do you mean? If the last
half-hour has proved anything,

14:04.200 --> 14:07.760
it's that teaming up with you
was pointless and a total hindrance,

14:07.800 --> 14:11.360
so I'm gonna go get something
they'll have to come back for.

14:11.400 --> 14:12.600
Alone.

14:12.640 --> 14:15.800
And I'll be using your car.
Why would I give you my car?

14:15.840 --> 14:18.240
Because you'll be in prison.
(SIREN WAILS)

14:19.280 --> 14:21.960
(LAUGHS) Looks like
the USB stick you handed in

14:22.000 --> 14:23.960
incriminated more than just Deacon.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.880
Well, it did after my little chat
with the investigator.

14:27.920 --> 14:29.280
How do you know I did?

14:29.320 --> 14:32.000
I've always been a very good
friend of the law, Alfie.

14:32.040 --> 14:33.520
It's all about leverage.

14:33.560 --> 14:36.320
So now, I'm gonna take
something that means Deacon

14:36.360 --> 14:38.640
and Allison will bring
the money to me.

14:38.680 --> 14:41.720
In a bit. Alfie Bower?
I'm placing you under arrest.

14:41.760 --> 14:45.840
I haven't got a clue what
you're on about.(RECITES CAUTION)

14:47.400 --> 14:48.720
You wanker!

14:48.760 --> 14:51.360
Do you understand your rights?
You dickhead!

14:51.400 --> 14:53.360
Get in the car.
Bring me the sister.

14:53.400 --> 14:54.960
Tiny cock!

14:59.400 --> 15:00.840
So...

15:02.320 --> 15:04.280
Jackson.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.680
We're doing this now?
You really want to know?

15:07.640 --> 15:09.200
Yeah.

15:09.240 --> 15:11.840
Deacon, I was broke.

15:11.880 --> 15:14.960
I basically had to raise Esme
single-handedly.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.480
Yeah, I know that, but...

15:16.520 --> 15:19.400
So, I fell in with a bad crowd
and I met a guy, Jackson.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.880
And he taught me
how to make some money.

15:21.920 --> 15:24.240
Small scams and stuff now and then.

15:24.280 --> 15:25.720
He got cocky,

15:25.760 --> 15:29.080
he wanted to do one, big, last job
as a way of getting out.

15:30.240 --> 15:32.320
Got caught

15:32.360 --> 15:34.120
and I had to run.

15:34.160 --> 15:36.440
You've done it before.

15:36.480 --> 15:40.240
Oh my God, you've done it before.
It's not like I'm Keyser Soze.

15:40.280 --> 15:44.640
Do you know what? I thought
we were on a mad adventure together.

15:44.680 --> 15:47.440
Trying to start a family,

15:47.480 --> 15:49.560
but it turns out I'm a mug.
That's the thing.

15:49.600 --> 15:53.200
I want a family,
I want children with you.

15:53.240 --> 15:56.120
I want, you know,
like, a normal life.

15:56.160 --> 15:58.240
That's why I fell in love with you.

15:58.280 --> 16:01.760
You were normal
until you went all Scarface on me.

16:01.800 --> 16:04.480
Well, who the fuck
do you think made me that way?

16:07.120 --> 16:08.120
(SIGHS)

16:10.680 --> 16:12.240
So, what does this mean?

16:15.000 --> 16:16.880
I don't know anymore.

16:16.920 --> 16:17.920
I mean,

16:18.920 --> 16:22.000
how can I believe anything you say?

16:26.560 --> 16:28.680
Any snacks or beverages?
BOTH: No.

16:31.560 --> 16:33.200
(LINE TRILLING)

16:34.560 --> 16:36.560
Esme is still not picking up.

16:38.360 --> 16:40.680
Oh, so now we're just not talking?

16:43.480 --> 16:45.080
We can't use our own.

16:46.040 --> 16:47.720
Here.

16:47.760 --> 16:50.120
I saved a couple from back
in Jersey just in case.

16:50.160 --> 16:52.080
Of course you did.
Of course you did.

16:52.120 --> 16:55.040
I imagine you paid off security
as well. Knowing you.

16:55.080 --> 16:58.440
What's wrong with you?
I'm just a bit nervous, OK?

16:58.480 --> 17:02.160
This is the face of someone who
isn't a friend of airport security.

17:03.560 --> 17:06.520
Why are we doing this? We're never
gonna get the bag through.

17:06.560 --> 17:08.160
That's why.

17:08.200 --> 17:10.360
(BABY CRIES) (KID SHOUTS)

17:10.400 --> 17:12.560
Why? So we can have an awful family?

17:12.600 --> 17:15.040
No, because it's not fair.

17:15.080 --> 17:17.720
Because everybody gets to have
a family.

17:17.760 --> 17:19.680
Even shit people get to be parents,

17:19.720 --> 17:21.680
growing up I didn't have
a normal family.

17:21.720 --> 17:25.280
Then I met you, and I thought ooh,
maybe this is my chance to have one.

17:25.320 --> 17:27.960
Is that so fucking unreasonable?

17:28.000 --> 17:31.160
Well, no, but I mean...
look where it's got us.

17:31.200 --> 17:33.400
What happens when we get
to the other end of this?

17:33.440 --> 17:35.600
I don't even know
what our plan is anymore.

17:35.640 --> 17:38.440
I'm sick of it.
MAN: Come through.
I'm done with it.

17:38.480 --> 17:41.000
The injections, the examinations,
the hormones,

17:41.040 --> 17:43.320
fucking pineapple cores,
the cold baths.

17:43.360 --> 17:46.400
The constant, crushing,
gut-wrenching disappointment

17:46.440 --> 17:49.800
that my womb is a deformed
fucking failure. I'm sick of it.

17:52.480 --> 17:54.440
Holy shit.
We actually made it through.

17:54.480 --> 17:57.720
I thought we were nailed on
for a cavity search.

18:00.200 --> 18:02.320
Deacon, I'm not gonna
steal the money.

18:02.360 --> 18:06.560
I wasn't saying that. It's just...
I need to get my head straight, OK?

18:06.600 --> 18:09.160
We need to get out of here.
I've got this.

18:17.040 --> 18:19.120
CHED: Yo.Ched, baby.

Can I get you folks a drink?
I'd like a big fucking vodka,
please, Kieran.

18:42.800 --> 18:46.320
Yeah, same. Have you got
one of those big duty free bottles?

18:46.360 --> 18:49.480
Our card machine isn't working.
I don't suppose you've got cash.

18:49.520 --> 18:52.520
Yeah, that's not a problem.
I'll just go get one for you.

18:52.560 --> 18:56.200
It's nice to have something
that isn't a bloody problem.

Deacon,

18:58.920 --> 19:01.280
I am genuinely sorry.

19:01.320 --> 19:04.400
I feel like our plan
not only failed to give us a child

19:04.440 --> 19:06.840
but messed us up, too.

19:06.880 --> 19:08.920
(SIGHS) Yeah, I know.

19:09.920 --> 19:12.200
I mean, maybe it's a blessing
in disguise.

19:12.240 --> 19:13.640

hardly the best situation
to give a kid a good start.

have been worse than them.

Really?

19:35.160 --> 19:36.920
I don't know. Maybe.

19:40.560 --> 19:42.560
Maybe we're better off apart.

19:44.240 --> 19:46.280

to be us

19:46.320 --> 19:49.320
doing something together
for our family,

19:49.360 --> 19:52.600
and turns out we've been lying
to each other the whole time.

really see how we get past that.
