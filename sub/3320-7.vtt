00:02.698 --> 00:03.960
Hi, I'’m Christy.

00:04.046 --> 00:06.136
I will be your server tonight.

00:06.223 --> 00:07.920
Let me tell you
about our specials.

00:08.007 --> 00:11.228
We have a lovely grilled salmon
on a bed of... Holy crap.

00:12.273 --> 00:13.752
[clears throat]

00:13.839 --> 00:15.972
She meant to say jasmine rice.
Excuse me.

00:19.236 --> 00:20.977
What was that?

00:21.064 --> 00:22.413
I can'’t go back in there.

00:22.500 --> 00:24.459
Ever?

00:24.546 --> 00:27.157
There'’s this girl I went to high
school with sitting at the bar.

00:27.244 --> 00:29.203
Don'’t tell me,
you screwed her over.

00:29.290 --> 00:31.031
Why would you say that?

00:31.118 --> 00:32.336
What, you sleep
with her boyfriend?

00:32.423 --> 00:33.337
Get out of my head!

00:33.424 --> 00:35.035
Come on.

00:35.122 --> 00:37.385
I-It was a long time ago.
I'’m sure she'’s over it.

00:37.472 --> 00:38.777
You think?No idea.

00:38.864 --> 00:41.389
Just need
to get you back to work.

00:41.476 --> 00:43.391
Table four--
you sleep with anybody there?

00:43.478 --> 00:45.306
No. Wait.

00:46.959 --> 00:48.091
No.

00:48.178 --> 00:50.180
Good. Take them their entrees.

00:50.267 --> 00:52.487
Try not to bang anyone
on the way.

00:52.574 --> 00:55.316
I can'’t promise anything.

00:55.403 --> 00:58.188
[sighs]

00:58.275 --> 01:01.148
Sobriety has not made
her any less crazy.

01:01.235 --> 01:03.411
You say that
like it'’s a bad thing.

01:04.673 --> 01:06.805
Enjoy your meal.

01:06.892 --> 01:07.763
Christy?

01:11.375 --> 01:12.811
Jessica?

01:12.898 --> 01:14.639
It'’s so good to see you!

01:14.726 --> 01:18.991
Oh, it'’s... good to see you.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.168
What'’s it been, like, 20 years?

01:21.255 --> 01:22.821
Yeah, I guess.
[chuckles]

01:22.908 --> 01:24.345
How'’s life?

01:24.432 --> 01:26.347
Great. Couldn'’t be happier.

01:26.434 --> 01:27.913
And you?

01:28.000 --> 01:29.611
I think my apron says it all.
[chuckles]

01:29.698 --> 01:31.178
Oh. [laughs]

01:31.265 --> 01:33.484
Well, I'’ll let you
get back to it.

01:33.571 --> 01:34.572
[chuckles]

01:34.659 --> 01:36.183
See you at the next reunion.

01:36.270 --> 01:39.186
[chuckles]
I can'’t wait.

01:39.273 --> 01:40.709
Jessica?

01:40.796 --> 01:43.277
Hang on.
Yeah?

01:43.364 --> 01:46.280
Something'’s been bothering me
for a really long time,

01:46.367 --> 01:48.891
and I need to clear the air.

01:48.978 --> 01:50.632
You mean with you and Tony?

01:51.807 --> 01:53.809
We were kids. Forget about it.

01:53.896 --> 01:55.419
Oh, thank you.

01:55.506 --> 01:57.117
[chuckles]

01:57.204 --> 01:59.423
I can'’t tell you
how much this has haunted me.

01:59.510 --> 02:00.946
Aw, all'’s forgiven.

02:01.033 --> 02:02.644
Oh, great!

02:02.731 --> 02:05.603
You know, in a way,
I kind of did you a favor.

02:05.690 --> 02:11.174
I mean, that clown
slept with everybody.

02:11.261 --> 02:12.088
He did?

02:12.175 --> 02:13.089
Oh, my God.

02:13.176 --> 02:14.090
Half the girls in our class

02:14.177 --> 02:16.745
and a couple of the moms.

02:16.832 --> 02:20.966
Lunch lady gave him extra tater
tots, if you know what I mean.

02:21.053 --> 02:22.794
Really?

02:22.881 --> 02:26.494
And from what I hear,
he is still a full-on man whore.

02:27.669 --> 02:29.410
Sorry I'’m late, honey.

02:29.497 --> 02:30.454
Tony?

02:30.541 --> 02:32.891
Christy?

02:32.978 --> 02:34.719
You and Jessica are still...

02:36.025 --> 02:37.069
Got to go.

02:39.550 --> 02:42.727
So, I hear you folks are
celebrating an anniversary.

03:03.052 --> 03:04.575
I really thought
by apologizing to Jessica

03:04.662 --> 03:06.490
I was doing a good thing.
You know?

03:06.577 --> 03:07.796
Making an amends.

03:07.883 --> 03:09.363
It was a good thing.

03:09.450 --> 03:11.974
Except for probably
breaking up their marriage.

03:12.061 --> 03:15.586
Yeah, they did not stay
for dinner.

03:15.673 --> 03:17.153
I hate to be a
stick-in-the-mud...

03:17.240 --> 03:20.330
No, you don'’t.

03:20.417 --> 03:22.593
...but next time you'’re
fixing the past,

03:22.680 --> 03:24.421
try not to break
the present.

03:24.508 --> 03:28.382
Boy, you'’re like
an embroidered pillow with feet.

03:28.469 --> 03:31.341
Okay, let'’s see
if I can do better this time.

03:31.428 --> 03:33.213
Marjorie,

03:33.300 --> 03:35.389
I'’d like to make
a proper amends to you.

03:35.476 --> 03:37.086
What for, sweetie?

03:37.173 --> 03:40.002
You lent me money,
and I never paid you back.

03:40.089 --> 03:42.047
Hey, I lent you money.

03:42.134 --> 03:44.267
Yeah. And you were never there
when I was growing up.

03:44.354 --> 03:45.355
We'’re square.

03:45.442 --> 03:47.401
Anyway,

03:47.488 --> 03:51.187
I'’ve been working extra shifts,
so here it is.

03:51.274 --> 03:52.493
Thank you.

03:52.580 --> 03:54.234
I really appreciate this.

03:56.540 --> 03:57.933
Now, what about your landlord?

03:58.020 --> 03:59.326
What about him?

03:59.413 --> 04:00.762
Christy, you skipped out
on the rent.

04:00.849 --> 04:02.503
You got to make that right.

04:02.590 --> 04:06.115
Or I could give you an extra $20

04:06.202 --> 04:09.553
and we all forget about it.

04:09.640 --> 04:11.251
You know, if you
want to clean house,

04:11.338 --> 04:13.165
you got to vacuum
under the couch.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.864
Another pillow.
Good for you.

04:16.995 --> 04:19.433
Marjorie, I owe him $4,000.

04:19.519 --> 04:21.826
I couldn'’t make that right
if I wanted to.

04:21.913 --> 04:23.611
Offer him a
payment plan.

04:23.698 --> 04:25.961
Give him-- I don'’t know--
50 bucks a month.

04:26.048 --> 04:27.571
50 bucks a month?

04:27.658 --> 04:30.270
That'’s gonna take, like...

04:30.357 --> 04:32.881
BOTH:
Six and a half years.

04:32.968 --> 04:36.580
Damn. Drug dealers
are so good at math.

04:41.629 --> 04:43.500
[sighs]

04:46.721 --> 04:50.072
$50? You owe me $4,000!

04:50.159 --> 04:52.204
But I don'’t have $4,000.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.555
Then you don'’t have your hand!

04:56.470 --> 04:58.341
[screaming]

05:04.173 --> 05:06.088
[exhales]

05:09.657 --> 05:10.962
Come in.

05:11.049 --> 05:12.921
Ooh, I just did my nails.

05:16.141 --> 05:18.448
Mr. Perugian?

05:18.535 --> 05:22.017
Crusty Plunkett.

05:22.104 --> 05:24.106
What do you want?

05:24.193 --> 05:26.587
Uh, well, first of all, hello.

05:28.153 --> 05:30.417
Okay. Um...

05:30.504 --> 05:33.115
you might not remember this,

05:33.202 --> 05:37.293
but I kind of sort of ran out
on the rent.

05:37.380 --> 05:39.991
$4,227.

05:40.078 --> 05:43.343
Okay, in my mind,
I had rounded it down,

05:43.430 --> 05:46.084
but, uh, that sounds
about right.

05:46.171 --> 05:48.565
Anyway, um, I...

05:48.652 --> 05:50.915
want to apologize.

05:51.002 --> 05:54.484
I was totally wrong,
and I...

05:54.571 --> 05:55.485
You have my money?

05:55.572 --> 05:57.748
Not all of it, no.

05:57.835 --> 05:59.707
Just this.

06:02.797 --> 06:04.625
$50?

06:04.712 --> 06:06.583
Ooh.

06:10.108 --> 06:13.808
Yes, I plan to pay you this
every month...

06:13.895 --> 06:14.939
Week.

06:15.026 --> 06:16.463
Week.
[chuckles]

06:16.550 --> 06:18.552
That'’s what I meant.

06:18.639 --> 06:22.207
I will come here every week
and give you $50.

06:22.294 --> 06:23.992
You don'’t have such
a great history

06:24.079 --> 06:26.037
of coming to me with money.
I'’ll come to you.

06:26.124 --> 06:27.256
Where do you live?

06:27.343 --> 06:30.172
Uh, 7219 Sycamore...

06:30.259 --> 06:31.521
Liar!

06:31.608 --> 06:33.523
6423 Sherborn,

06:33.610 --> 06:36.526
apartment 1B.

06:36.613 --> 06:38.223
Come on in.Thank you.

06:38.310 --> 06:40.878
How do you like
my post-divorce digs?

06:40.965 --> 06:42.750
Came furnished.

06:42.837 --> 06:45.230
Did they give you a noose
or you have to supply your own?

06:45.317 --> 06:47.624
Come on, it'’s not so bad.

06:47.711 --> 06:49.713
I get home from work
around 6:00,

06:49.800 --> 06:52.063
microwave dinner,
go down to the rec room,

06:52.150 --> 06:54.196
play a little Ping-Pong
with the other divorced guys,

06:54.283 --> 06:56.154
watch some TV,
and before you know it,

06:56.241 --> 06:59.157
it'’s 6:30.

06:59.244 --> 07:00.637
Is that an electric oven?

07:00.724 --> 07:01.595
Yeah.
Good.

07:03.988 --> 07:06.948
So what'’s up?
Why the cryptic text message?

07:07.035 --> 07:08.819
Well, I had some things
I wanted to talk to you about,

07:08.906 --> 07:10.430
and I wanted to do it
face-to-face.

07:10.517 --> 07:12.388
I'’m sorry.About what?

07:12.475 --> 07:13.998
I don'’t know.
It'’s just a reflex.

07:14.085 --> 07:15.739
Take it easy.

07:15.826 --> 07:17.437
This isn'’t about you;
it'’s about me.

07:17.524 --> 07:20.396
I need to apologize
for the stuff I did to you.

07:20.483 --> 07:21.615
Really?

07:21.702 --> 07:24.313
Wow, my sphincter just relaxed.

07:25.662 --> 07:27.621
What do you have
to apologize for?

07:27.708 --> 07:29.449
I'’m the one
that left you.

07:29.536 --> 07:33.975
Yes, and God is clearly
punishing you for that.

07:34.062 --> 07:36.194
But if our relationship
is going to move forward,

07:36.281 --> 07:39.154
I need to take responsibility
for the mess I made.

07:39.241 --> 07:41.635
Okay, I accept your apology.

07:41.722 --> 07:43.637
No, I need to tell you
all the things that I did

07:43.724 --> 07:45.377
and then ask
for your forgiveness.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.641
How many things we talking?

07:47.728 --> 07:48.946
Ooh.
[sputters]

07:49.033 --> 07:50.557
About 118.

07:50.644 --> 07:52.646
But there are a couple of things
I did twice,

07:52.733 --> 07:55.997
so it'’s up to you if you want
to count those separately.

07:56.084 --> 07:59.087
Okay, let '’er rip.

07:59.174 --> 08:01.481
January 7, 1976--
the night we met.

08:01.568 --> 08:03.787
I stole $100 out of your wallet.

08:03.874 --> 08:05.615
You said that was
my buddy Wayne.

08:05.702 --> 08:07.704
I never talked to him again!

08:07.791 --> 08:09.793
If you'’re gonna flip out
over each one of these,

08:09.880 --> 08:11.534
it'’s gonna take a lot longer
than it needs to.

08:13.101 --> 08:15.277
January 8, 1976.
I slept with Wayne.

08:15.364 --> 08:17.453
What?!

08:17.540 --> 08:19.411
In my defense,
I was trying to console him

08:19.499 --> 08:21.457
because he was so upset
about your friendship ending.

08:24.155 --> 08:26.506
Delivery.

08:26.593 --> 08:28.420
Eh, put it anywhere.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.510
How was the movie?

08:30.597 --> 08:33.991
We didn'’t go to a movie.
We went to a museum instead.

08:34.078 --> 08:37.472
Really? So you did
something educational?

08:37.559 --> 08:39.475
No, it was fun.

08:39.562 --> 08:41.999
Did you guys eat dinner?

08:42.086 --> 08:44.219
Yeah, my girlfriend packed us
some veggie wraps,

08:44.306 --> 08:46.961
so we stopped at
Jack in the Box.

08:47.048 --> 08:48.832
All right, fine.

08:48.919 --> 08:50.921
Go do your homework
and then get ready for bed.

08:51.008 --> 08:52.619
See you next
weekend, buddy.

08:52.706 --> 08:53.620
Love you, Dad.Love you, too.

08:55.796 --> 08:58.668
Well, I am very impressed.

08:58.755 --> 09:00.975
You'’re doing a great job
with him.

09:01.062 --> 09:02.411
Thank you.

09:02.498 --> 09:04.631
And you really turned your life
around.

09:04.718 --> 09:07.721
Good job,
solid relationship with Candace.

09:07.808 --> 09:11.289
Yeah, I'’m not cheating on her
at all.

09:11.376 --> 09:14.205
Boyfriend of the year.

09:14.292 --> 09:16.207
I'’m glad you
feel that way

09:16.294 --> 09:19.689
because I'’ve been wanting
to ask you something important.

09:19.776 --> 09:21.561
Anything.

09:23.475 --> 09:25.652
How would you feel about Roscoe
coming to live with me

09:25.739 --> 09:27.218
and Candace for a while?

09:27.305 --> 09:28.480
What?

09:28.568 --> 09:29.873
You know, we got the big house,

09:29.960 --> 09:31.179
and it'’s right by his school.

09:31.266 --> 09:32.833
He'’s got his own room.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.356
We'’re even thinking
about getting a dog.

09:34.443 --> 09:36.271
Are you out of your mind?

09:36.358 --> 09:38.360
Come on, Christy,
he sleeps in the closet here.

09:38.447 --> 09:40.754
It'’s a bonus room!

09:40.841 --> 09:43.104
Okay, calm down.
I don'’t want to fight.

09:43.191 --> 09:44.714
No one'’s fighting.

09:44.801 --> 09:46.890
I am calmly telling you
that you are a loser,

09:46.977 --> 09:48.631
you'’ll always be a loser,

09:48.718 --> 09:50.415
and you'’re not gonna take my kid
away from me.

09:50.502 --> 09:52.113
Yourkid?

09:52.200 --> 09:53.767
We made him together!

09:53.854 --> 09:56.813
I was in
that bathroom stall, too!

09:56.900 --> 09:58.815
Forget it!
It'’s not gonna happen!

09:58.902 --> 10:00.382
Now get out!

10:00.469 --> 10:02.253
All right,
but I think you should know

10:02.340 --> 10:03.820
that Candace'’s brother

10:03.907 --> 10:06.606
is a lawyer,
and he says I have rights.

10:06.693 --> 10:08.738
Really? You want
to bring a lawyer into this?

10:08.825 --> 10:10.566
Then you better
bring a gun, too!

10:12.220 --> 10:14.701
I'’m telling my lawyer
you said that!

10:21.316 --> 10:23.057
Okay, home stretch.
March 11, 1978.

10:23.144 --> 10:24.754
Your grandmother got
arrested at the airport

10:24.841 --> 10:26.930
carrying a bag
of my weed.

10:27.017 --> 10:29.803
You made my nana a mule?

10:29.890 --> 10:31.718
I didn'’t plan it.

10:31.805 --> 10:33.850
I saw a drug-sniffing dog
coming,

10:33.937 --> 10:36.548
I panicked and stuffed it
in her wheelchair.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.507
Before you say anything,
they let her go,

10:38.594 --> 10:40.683
and I told her
if she kept it a secret,

10:40.770 --> 10:42.163
I'’d give her a great-grandchild.

10:42.250 --> 10:44.687
Here'’s a big one.

10:44.774 --> 10:47.298
Your cousin David.
You still in touch with him?

10:47.385 --> 10:48.996
Yeah, we'’re very close.

10:49.083 --> 10:50.954
Okay, well, then I'’m just
gonna skip that.

10:53.130 --> 10:56.438
And finally, about a
year after you left me...

10:56.525 --> 10:59.136
Well, this is a tough one.

10:59.223 --> 11:01.269
Not proud of this.

11:01.356 --> 11:04.141
I set your vintage Corvette
on fire.

11:06.274 --> 11:08.493
I never owned a Corvette.

11:08.580 --> 11:10.974
Really?

11:12.759 --> 11:14.978
Okay, I'’m gonna have
to track that guy down.

11:16.414 --> 11:18.373
Wow!

11:18.460 --> 11:21.593
I should have done
this years ago.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.726
I feel great.

11:23.813 --> 11:26.381
Like a weight has been
lifted off my shoulders.

11:26.468 --> 11:28.818
Yeah, good for you.

11:28.905 --> 11:30.559
No, good for us.

11:30.646 --> 11:32.561
We have a clean slate,

11:32.648 --> 11:35.607
fresh start,
nothing'’s stopping us.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.566
Sorry, I can'’t do this now.

11:37.653 --> 11:39.089
You need to take a pill?

11:41.613 --> 11:43.572
How could you do
all that stuff to me?

11:43.659 --> 11:45.966
Okay, clearly you don'’t
understand how this works.

11:46.053 --> 11:48.664
See, this is the part
where you forgive me.

11:48.751 --> 11:50.622
Yeah, well, I don'’t think I can.

11:50.710 --> 11:54.191
Hey, I forgave you
for walking out on me.

11:54.278 --> 11:56.063
After hearing all this,

11:56.150 --> 11:59.283
walking out on you was
the smartest thing I ever did!

11:59.370 --> 12:03.157
Okay, I think this party'’s over.

12:06.203 --> 12:09.946
Just so you know, you have
ruined this amends for me!

12:15.996 --> 12:18.041
Hey, how'’d it go with Dad?

12:18.128 --> 12:20.087
Oh, we hate him now.

12:20.174 --> 12:21.566
We do?
Yup.

12:21.653 --> 12:23.090
I'’m gonna need
you to step up.

12:23.177 --> 12:27.268
Well, uh, you can join
me in hating Baxter.

12:27.355 --> 12:29.052
Dumb-ass wants Roscoe
to live with him.

12:29.139 --> 12:30.053
You'’re kidding.

12:30.140 --> 12:31.794
Completely forgetting

12:31.881 --> 12:33.883
that three months ago,
he was living in his van,

12:33.970 --> 12:37.757
smoking pot out of an apple,
then giving Roscoe the apple.

12:39.323 --> 12:40.585
Can you check my
homework, Mom?

12:40.672 --> 12:43.110
What? Oh, yeah, sure.

12:43.197 --> 12:44.633
[clears throat]
Okay.

12:44.720 --> 12:47.288
"Train A leaves the station
traveling at 30 miles

12:47.375 --> 12:48.768
per hour, and Train B leaves..."

12:48.855 --> 12:50.944
You know what?

12:51.031 --> 12:52.815
I have a better math problem
for you.

12:52.902 --> 12:56.340
This is the one the teacher'’s
looking for, but okay.

12:56.427 --> 12:59.779
Train A is leaving
with your mommy.

12:59.866 --> 13:01.128
Train B

13:01.215 --> 13:02.999
is leaving with your daddy.

13:03.086 --> 13:04.914
Which train would you
rather be on?

13:06.437 --> 13:07.612
Where'’s Dad'’s train going?

13:07.699 --> 13:09.484
Loserville.

13:09.571 --> 13:10.833
Where'’s your train going?

13:10.920 --> 13:12.617
Disneyland.

13:12.704 --> 13:15.142
Seriously?

13:15.229 --> 13:16.230
Stay out of it, Violet.

13:17.884 --> 13:20.147
And my train stops
for ice cream on the way.

13:20.234 --> 13:21.496
Let me think.

13:21.583 --> 13:22.845
What'’s there to think about?

13:22.932 --> 13:26.196
I could be the
King of Loserville.

13:26.283 --> 13:27.981
Oh, come on, make a decision.

13:28.068 --> 13:29.896
Roscoe, leave your homework
with me.

13:29.983 --> 13:31.854
Mom'’s not good at math.

13:35.771 --> 13:38.252
You are scary.

13:38.339 --> 13:41.995
No, what'’s scary is the idea
of Baxter trying to parent him.

13:42.082 --> 13:43.561
That'’s not fair. When
you guys were together,

13:43.648 --> 13:44.780
Baxter was a pretty good dad.

13:44.867 --> 13:46.564
Are you seriously defending him?

13:46.651 --> 13:48.784
Do you believe this?

13:48.871 --> 13:52.483
I'’m just here as your mother.
I don'’t want to get involved.

13:52.570 --> 13:55.138
Baxter did nothing
but smoke pot,

13:55.225 --> 13:58.098
sit on the couch and yell
the wrong answers at Jeopardy.

13:58.185 --> 14:01.492
Never once in the form
of a question.

14:01.579 --> 14:03.843
While you got drunk and
disappeared for days.

14:03.930 --> 14:06.019
That'’s not true.

14:06.106 --> 14:08.369
Remember Roscoe'’s
first-grade graduation?

14:08.456 --> 14:09.979
Of course you don'’t.

14:10.066 --> 14:11.851
You were too hung-over
to get out of bed.

14:11.938 --> 14:13.722
But Baxter was there.
Really?

14:13.809 --> 14:15.593
Well, he went to the third
grade graduation first,

14:15.680 --> 14:18.422
but eventually he
found the right room.

14:18.509 --> 14:20.685
Fine. He showed up to one event.

14:20.772 --> 14:22.252
Hooray for Baxter.

14:22.339 --> 14:23.906
Let'’s put him on a stamp.

14:23.993 --> 14:25.386
You may not want to remember

14:25.473 --> 14:27.692
what went on around here,
but I do.

14:33.133 --> 14:34.743
Don'’t worry.

14:34.830 --> 14:38.138
She'’s smoking pot now,
so her memories will fade.

14:40.967 --> 14:42.882
[phone ringing]

14:44.971 --> 14:47.234
Building manager.

14:47.321 --> 14:49.323
Hello, Joanne Wickie in 3B.

14:49.410 --> 14:51.934
What can I do for you?

14:52.021 --> 14:55.242
Hot water cut off in the middle
of your shower again?

14:55.329 --> 14:57.244
I'’ll be right over.

14:57.331 --> 15:00.856
Hey, do me a favor.
Put on a robe this time.

15:00.943 --> 15:03.554
I know you'’re comfortable
with your body, but I'’m not.

15:05.687 --> 15:07.863
I blame Lena Dunham.

15:12.389 --> 15:14.000
Hey.

15:14.087 --> 15:15.915
Oh. Hello.

15:16.002 --> 15:17.481
Got a minute?

15:17.568 --> 15:19.657
I'’m on my way to see
a 300-pound naked woman

15:19.744 --> 15:22.922
with soap in her eyes, so...

15:23.009 --> 15:24.662
yes.

15:26.882 --> 15:29.580
I wanted to apologize for
the way I acted the other day.

15:29.667 --> 15:31.756
Keep going.

15:31.843 --> 15:34.411
I realized the only reason
you told me all those things was

15:34.498 --> 15:37.284
so we could start fresh,
and I really want that.

15:37.371 --> 15:39.808
You didn'’t have to come
all the way over here for that.

15:39.895 --> 15:41.244
You could have just called.

15:41.331 --> 15:43.594
I know, but then
I couldn'’t do this.

15:48.860 --> 15:50.079
[laughs]

15:50.166 --> 15:51.298
Bravo!

15:51.385 --> 15:53.300
[laughs]
[sighs]

15:53.387 --> 15:55.824
I couldn'’t have done it
without you.

15:55.911 --> 15:58.696
35 years.
Worth the wait.

15:58.783 --> 16:01.525
Oh. Is it just me,

16:01.612 --> 16:05.181
or is sex better now
than when we were kids?

16:05.268 --> 16:07.096
Well, it'’s longer.

16:07.183 --> 16:09.055
[both laugh]

16:11.753 --> 16:14.016
[sighs]
It is better.

16:14.103 --> 16:16.018
Yeah. [laughs]

16:16.105 --> 16:18.238
Oh.

16:18.325 --> 16:20.588
You know, I was thinking
about all the secrets

16:20.675 --> 16:21.676
you unloaded on me.

16:21.763 --> 16:23.504
Yeah?

16:23.591 --> 16:27.029
And I thought maybe I should
do the same, clean the slate.

16:27.116 --> 16:28.683
That'’s great.

16:28.770 --> 16:32.295
Okay, here'’s something
you never knew

16:32.382 --> 16:33.993
that'’s always sort of
bothered me.

16:34.080 --> 16:37.431
Ooh!

16:37.518 --> 16:40.347
You remember that Labor Day
weekend you spent in jail

16:40.434 --> 16:42.349
'’cause I couldn'’t afford
to bail you out?

16:42.436 --> 16:44.090
Yeah?

16:44.177 --> 16:48.224
I had the money, but I just
needed a break from you.

16:51.271 --> 16:53.969
[laughs]:
Come on, that'’s funny.

16:56.493 --> 16:58.452
BONNIE:
Get out!

17:01.542 --> 17:04.109
I like you, Dave, but I can'’t
go any lower on this car

17:04.196 --> 17:05.981
without checking
with my manager.

17:06.068 --> 17:07.329
Wish me luck.

17:08.505 --> 17:10.159
[scoffs]
Luck.

17:10.246 --> 17:12.727
[laughs]

17:12.814 --> 17:15.382
Hey.

17:15.469 --> 17:17.558
Baxter, got a minute?

17:17.645 --> 17:20.604
Oh. Hello, Christy.

17:20.691 --> 17:23.085
I'’m being aloof because
of our fight the other day,

17:23.172 --> 17:27.568
unless you'’re here to buy a car,
in which case you look lovely.

17:27.655 --> 17:30.919
I wanted to talk to you
about Roscoe.

17:31.006 --> 17:32.747
I'’m listening.

17:32.834 --> 17:35.924
I'’m sorry I said all those
awful things about you.

17:36.011 --> 17:37.317
Mm-hmm.

17:37.404 --> 17:39.101
Yeah, I was talking to Violet,

17:39.188 --> 17:42.931
and she reminded me
of a couple important factors.

17:43.018 --> 17:43.975
Did she now?

17:44.063 --> 17:45.629
You did a lot of good stuff

17:45.716 --> 17:48.545
for my kids
when I wasn'’t there for them,

17:48.632 --> 17:51.766
and I never thanked you.

17:51.853 --> 17:54.247
So... thank you.

17:54.334 --> 17:56.510
And I'’m sorry.

17:56.597 --> 17:59.078
Hey, is this one of those
amends things?

17:59.165 --> 18:00.775
I guess it is.

18:00.862 --> 18:03.778
Cool, I'’ve never
gotten one of those.

18:03.865 --> 18:05.780
Bring it in. Bring
it in, come on.

18:05.867 --> 18:09.305
I'’m just scared that now
that you have a beautiful house

18:09.392 --> 18:11.351
and a pool
and this great new life

18:11.438 --> 18:14.005
that Roscoe will never want
to come back to my place.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.442
Of course he will.

18:15.529 --> 18:16.921
Why?

18:17.008 --> 18:18.923
Are you kidding?

18:19.010 --> 18:20.490
Because you'’re there.

18:20.577 --> 18:24.494
Oh, God, I'’m not sure I can deal

18:24.581 --> 18:27.932
with you turning into
a decent human being.

18:28.019 --> 18:30.892
It'’s weird, right?

18:32.894 --> 18:34.983
Does this mean you'’re
gonna let him live with me?

18:35.070 --> 18:36.463
[sighs]

18:36.550 --> 18:38.117
How about every other week?

18:38.204 --> 18:40.902
That'’s great. Thank you.

18:40.989 --> 18:43.948
Okay, I'’ll see you soon.

18:44.035 --> 18:45.994
Wait. Christy...

18:46.081 --> 18:48.301
I got to tell you something.

18:48.388 --> 18:49.606
What?

18:51.956 --> 18:54.959
There will never
be a better time

18:55.046 --> 18:58.572
to put yourself in a pre-owned
four-wheel-drive hatchback.

19:01.923 --> 19:03.838
Good-bye, Baxter.

19:09.060 --> 19:10.714
This is your lucky day, Dave.

19:10.801 --> 19:13.369
My manager says we have a deal!

19:20.637 --> 19:21.986
44, 45...

19:22.073 --> 19:23.640
Hang on, hang on.

19:23.727 --> 19:26.817
Uh, 25 cents, 50 cents...

19:26.904 --> 19:27.992
We set a schedule.

19:28.079 --> 19:29.820
How is this a
surprise to you?

19:31.213 --> 19:32.214
Mom, you got five bucks?

19:32.301 --> 19:34.173
Yeah, hold on.

19:36.349 --> 19:38.525
Here you go.

19:38.612 --> 19:40.875
Ladies, your tea
is getting cold.

19:40.962 --> 19:42.485
Who'’s that?

19:42.572 --> 19:45.488
A... friend of ours.

19:45.575 --> 19:48.839
She spoken for?

19:48.926 --> 19:52.365
Just by some cats.

19:52.452 --> 19:56.412
Could you make an introduction?

19:56.499 --> 19:58.414
Sure, I guess.

19:58.501 --> 20:01.330
For 50 bucks.

20:01.417 --> 20:03.202
What?

20:03.289 --> 20:05.813
[mocking accent]: You want
to haggle, it'’s a hundred.

20:10.426 --> 20:12.602
Okay.

20:12.689 --> 20:16.171
Uh, would you like
to come in for some tea?

20:16.258 --> 20:17.477
Sure.

20:21.916 --> 20:24.788
You realize we just pimped out
our dearest friend for 50 bucks.

20:24.875 --> 20:26.442
I think he overpaid.
