00:01.790 --> 00:04.000
[female newscaster] Former
Mayor, William Cadigan Clarke

00:04.040 --> 00:06.540
was released from prison
today after serving two years

00:06.590 --> 00:08.300
of a three
year sentence.

00:08.340 --> 00:10.590
Clarke was charged with
accepting kickbacks

00:10.630 --> 00:12.260
for municipal contracts.

00:12.300 --> 00:15.970
As well as for accepting bribes
for his support on key issues.

00:16.010 --> 00:17.760
I insist that I am innocent.

00:17.800 --> 00:20.100
That I am the victim
of a vast conspiracy--

00:20.140 --> 00:22.180
Orchestrated by the Royal
Newfoundland Constabulary.

00:22.230 --> 00:25.850
This is nothing
other than a smear campaign.

00:25.900 --> 00:27.690
And it's implemented
by the local police.

00:27.730 --> 00:29.150
One officer in particular.

00:29.190 --> 00:31.490
[Hood] Yeah. A
conspiracy to take down

00:31.530 --> 00:34.030
the most corrupt mayor
in our history.

00:34.070 --> 00:36.570
Didn't Clare and Leslie
Bennett have a--

00:36.620 --> 00:37.530
thing?

00:37.580 --> 00:39.700
Yeah, boss. But--

00:39.740 --> 00:41.250
When it came time
to do what had to be done,

00:41.290 --> 00:42.910
Bennett,
she took care of business.

00:42.960 --> 00:43.830
[Tinny]
B'ys.

00:44.540 --> 00:45.500
Hey.

00:45.540 --> 00:46.630
Inspector.

00:46.670 --> 00:48.800
Watching TV on job,
are we?

00:48.840 --> 00:50.090
No.

00:50.130 --> 00:52.340
You're right. Sorry.
Everyone get back to work.

00:53.630 --> 00:55.550
Sorry about that.

00:57.140 --> 01:01.180
Not exactly a great way to start
my tenure as your superior.

01:01.220 --> 01:03.770
I have work to do.
If you'll excuse me.

01:06.060 --> 01:07.900
[newscaster] Clarke, who
served two terms as mayor,

01:07.940 --> 01:08.110
was released today.

01:09.230 --> 01:11.190
Throughout his entire
incarceration,

01:11.230 --> 01:12.530
he has maintained
his innocence.

01:12.570 --> 01:13.450
Clarke is out.
And it's not fit.

01:14.860 --> 01:17.620
Jake, isn't that that super hot
loan shark missus,

01:17.660 --> 01:19.200
Harley Denief?

01:19.240 --> 01:22.240
It's obvious Clarke is picking
up exactly where he left off.

01:22.290 --> 01:23.540
[phone notice sound]

01:23.580 --> 01:25.120
Oh. We gotta meet Mal,

01:27.170 --> 01:28.710
Des, you didn't make a deposit

01:28.750 --> 01:30.090
this week, by any
chance, did you?

01:30.130 --> 01:31.920
No, why? Rose might have.

01:31.960 --> 01:33.590
Yeah, I bet she did.

01:34.470 --> 01:35.510
Probably nothing.

01:35.930 --> 01:36.630
Come on.

01:36.680 --> 01:37.890
Are you coming or what?

01:37.930 --> 01:40.390
Ah, no. And this is a tad
embarrassing, but--

01:40.430 --> 01:43.350
There's an issue
with the bathroom,

01:43.390 --> 01:45.730
that we both now share.

01:45.770 --> 01:48.940
'Cause being roommates and...
It's time sensitive.

01:52.270 --> 01:54.690
[Sloan on phone] Yeah. You
got me. Leave a message.

01:56.200 --> 01:57.610
[Mal]
My son, Jake.

01:57.650 --> 01:59.910
Still learning to tell the big
hand from the little one.

01:59.950 --> 02:02.370
Sorry I'm late. I hope he
wasn't too much of a bother.

02:02.410 --> 02:03.950
I'm actually his legal
guardian.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.370
Elsa Tessier.

02:05.410 --> 02:07.750
It's no bother at all. He's been
more charming than you.

02:07.790 --> 02:09.420
Too bad everyone's
not like him.

02:09.460 --> 02:11.250
[Mal] Elsa's been
getting death threats.

02:11.290 --> 02:13.130
Really. Any idea who might
be behind them?

02:13.170 --> 02:13.630
Likely business related.

02:14.710 --> 02:16.170
My company was awarded
the contract

02:16.220 --> 02:17.380
for the airport expansion.

02:17.420 --> 02:18.510
That ruffled
a few feathers.

02:19.140 --> 02:20.510
Probably nothing.

02:20.550 --> 02:22.930
But this past week, I've
been getting a few random texts.

02:22.970 --> 02:25.350
I thought it would be a good
idea to get some protection.

02:25.390 --> 02:27.600
These are quite
the text messages.

02:27.640 --> 02:29.900
Stop what you're doing
or you're dead.

02:29.940 --> 02:31.940
Liar. Last warning.

02:31.980 --> 02:33.190
Have you gone to
the cops with any of this?

02:33.230 --> 02:35.070
I thought it was
childishness at first.

02:35.110 --> 02:37.900
Then Elsa came out of her
office and found that.

02:39.030 --> 02:40.030
[Jake] Cheater.

02:41.660 --> 02:43.370
I gotta be honest, Elsa.
This whole thing.

02:44.790 --> 02:47.370
It just feels a lot more
personal than professional.

02:47.870 --> 02:48.710
Hear that?

02:49.330 --> 02:50.750
[gauge rattles]

02:52.250 --> 02:53.210
Get down!

02:53.250 --> 02:54.130

take you to the hospital.

03:27.620 --> 03:28.580
Just to be safe.

03:28.620 --> 03:29.830
No. I'm fine. Really.

03:31.080 --> 03:32.870
I think we should call
the cops in on this.

03:32.920 --> 03:35.800
No police. This is a huge
contract for me. I can't--

03:35.840 --> 03:35.920
lose it.

03:37.260 --> 03:39.050
If I seem, in any way,
unable to finish the job,

03:39.090 --> 03:40.920
I'd be in breach of contract.

03:40.970 --> 03:42.130
One of my
competitors will finish it.

03:42.180 --> 03:43.840
My company's
reputation will be ruined.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.100
[Des]
Been there.

03:45.140 --> 03:46.850
I was a Dickie-Dee ice cream
guy one summer.

03:46.890 --> 03:48.470
All of a sudden,
Ice Cream Joe moves in,

03:48.520 --> 03:49.520
and suddenly
I can't move a Dixie cup.

03:50.810 --> 03:52.310
How do you want us to handle
the information

03:52.350 --> 03:53.900
about the big explosion?

03:53.940 --> 03:56.320
As far as anyone's concerned,
this was an industrial accident.

03:56.980 --> 03:58.570
Well, you've hired us.

03:58.610 --> 04:01.820
So, it's your prerogative on how
you want us to proceed. But--

04:02.530 --> 04:03.740
I can't help but feel

04:03.780 --> 04:05.320
like you're holding
something back from us.

04:05.370 --> 04:09.000
Yeah. It all feels a little
personal, don't you think?

04:14.750 --> 04:16.130
Curtis Mercer.

04:16.170 --> 04:18.090
My soon to be ex-husband.

04:19.050 --> 04:20.460
[Jake]
He look familiar to you?

04:20.510 --> 04:21.800
We're going
through a divorce.

04:21.840 --> 04:22.970
I have a pre-nup with him.

04:23.010 --> 04:24.260
So if you split,
he gets nothing.

04:24.300 --> 04:25.640
And if anything
happens to you--

04:25.680 --> 04:27.640
He gets the lot. Yes.

04:27.680 --> 04:30.730
I think it's time we had
a little chat with Curtis.

04:30.770 --> 04:31.640
Don't you?

04:37.060 --> 04:38.980
You see the news today?

04:39.020 --> 04:40.570
The old mayor Clarke
is back in town.

04:40.610 --> 04:42.530
Yeah. He was a crook.
Plain and simple.

04:43.650 --> 04:45.490
And if he had
any dignity left at all,

04:45.530 --> 04:46.950
he'd slither out of town.

04:46.990 --> 04:48.910
You should run for
mayor. I'd vote for you.

04:48.950 --> 04:50.490
Yeah, I can see the
headlines now:

04:50.540 --> 04:52.160
Mayor's son caught
with pants down.

04:52.200 --> 04:53.210
Again.

04:53.250 --> 04:54.750
- Is that smoke?
- Yeah.

04:58.790 --> 05:01.840
You guys are late. Get your
clothes off and get in there.

05:09.640 --> 05:11.720
[Luke] You got a pretty good
deal going here, don't you?

05:12.890 --> 05:15.020
Hooking in with this family.
Nice work.

05:15.060 --> 05:16.310
Like I said.
Be quiet.

05:17.020 --> 05:17.940
Get his cash?

05:18.650 --> 05:19.820
It's in my bag.

05:24.320 --> 05:25.450
That should hold Saul.

05:25.490 --> 05:26.820
I told you we shouldn't have

05:26.860 --> 05:28.700
borrowed from him
in the first place.

05:29.950 --> 05:31.120
[Luke]

05:31.160 --> 05:33.370
[whispering] Shut up.
Hide the cash. Now.

05:33.410 --> 05:34.410
[Rose] Sloan.

05:34.460 --> 05:35.710
I'm changing!

05:35.750 --> 05:36.870
Who's in there?

05:36.920 --> 05:38.040
Nobody. My TV.

05:38.080 --> 05:39.790
My headphones
fell out of my phone.

05:41.800 --> 05:42.920
Get out!

05:42.960 --> 05:43.840
Oh!

05:48.430 --> 05:50.470
Um. Who are you?

05:54.020 --> 05:54.980
I'm Luke.

05:55.980 --> 05:56.940
Sloan's--

05:58.150 --> 05:59.650
I'm her boyfriend.

05:59.690 --> 06:00.610
Well,

06:01.270 --> 06:01.860
Luke.

06:03.150 --> 06:05.860
I suggest you jump out that
window right now.

06:05.900 --> 06:07.780
Before somebody other than me

06:07.820 --> 06:10.120
finds you and
throws you out of it,

06:10.160 --> 06:11.410
Are you jok--

06:13.700 --> 06:15.290
I realize we're on
the second floor.

06:15.330 --> 06:16.250
But I want to teach you

06:16.290 --> 06:17.660
to never come back here again.

06:17.710 --> 06:18.960
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

06:22.090 --> 06:23.090
Good.

06:25.550 --> 06:27.880
Even though Elsa and I are going
through a rough patch right now,

06:27.920 --> 06:29.130
I'd never do
anything to hurt her.

06:29.180 --> 06:30.390
Look Sloan.
Just call me back, all right.

06:30.430 --> 06:30.470
We're working here.

06:32.100 --> 06:35.220
We're creative as a couple.
We're in an open relationship.

06:36.230 --> 06:37.890
I know where I recognize
this guy.

06:37.930 --> 06:39.770
William L. Chafe and Sons.
The store.

06:39.810 --> 06:41.440
We busted him.

06:41.480 --> 06:44.320
He was taking dirty pictures of
women while they were changing.

06:44.360 --> 06:45.690
Brandon Mercer.

06:45.730 --> 06:46.940
I had that changed.

06:46.990 --> 06:47.740
My name is Curtis.

06:49.320 --> 06:52.410
I had issues then. But I got
help. Elsa knows all about it.

06:52.450 --> 06:54.240
Photography is my release.

06:54.280 --> 06:56.660
His release. His release is
hanging out in a garage

06:56.700 --> 06:57.790
that apparently he lives in.

06:57.830 --> 06:59.710
Where everyone including
himself is naked.

06:59.750 --> 07:01.250
You know, Brandon--

07:01.290 --> 07:03.590
I mean Curtis-- some people
might think that's disgusting.

07:03.630 --> 07:05.130
I'm an artist.

07:05.170 --> 07:06.880
There's a fine line between
what some people might think--

07:06.920 --> 07:08.510
Curtis. We know about
the pre-nup.

07:08.550 --> 07:11.340
You won't get a cent. Unless
something was to happen to Elsa.

07:11.390 --> 07:12.590
Wait, wait, wait.

07:12.640 --> 07:14.850
I still love my wife.

07:14.890 --> 07:16.260
And I plan to win Elsa back.

07:16.310 --> 07:19.520
Then you might want to
reconsider the game plan here.

07:23.610 --> 07:24.650
You know--

07:24.690 --> 07:25.320
Curtis. I'm no artist.

07:26.690 --> 07:28.990
But these look like
surveillance pictures to me.

07:29.030 --> 07:30.070
So?

07:30.110 --> 07:32.160
I was following my wife.
Is that illegal.

07:32.200 --> 07:34.740
Yes, actually, it is. And why
would you want to do that?

07:35.950 --> 07:37.990
To find out if Else was
cheating on me.

07:38.040 --> 07:40.870
Says the man who hangs out with
hot naked girls in his garage.

07:41.420 --> 07:42.420
Who's buddy?

07:42.460 --> 07:43.750
[Curtis]
Blake Brogan.

07:43.790 --> 07:45.420
He owns a small contracting
company that bid on

07:45.460 --> 07:48.420
the same airport expansion
contract that Elsa did.

07:48.460 --> 07:50.170
But he lost. She won.

07:50.220 --> 07:53.050
And get this. Now
he works for her.

07:57.310 --> 07:57.350
What?

07:58.600 --> 08:00.140
I dunno. Maybe it's just
Leslie and Clarke.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.770
Now the naked guy
in the garage.

08:01.810 --> 08:03.270
Sounds like the
beginning of a dirty joke.

08:04.520 --> 08:06.940
I got a weird sinking feeling
about Sloan.

08:06.980 --> 08:09.110
Sinking feeling? How?
What do you mean?

08:09.150 --> 08:10.400
Never repeat what
I'm about to tell ya.

08:11.490 --> 08:13.070
But our safe is a lot.
And I mean--

08:13.110 --> 08:15.530
A lot short of cash.

08:16.700 --> 08:18.330
I saw her over by the
thing yesterday.

08:18.370 --> 08:18.410
Oh.

08:19.910 --> 08:23.620
I'm not saying that she had
anything to do with it.

08:23.670 --> 08:26.130
I don't even know what I'm
getting on with.

08:26.170 --> 08:27.090
Even if you're right--

08:27.130 --> 08:28.380
And I'm not saying that I am.

08:28.420 --> 08:29.670
Exactly. We'll deal with it.

08:31.170 --> 08:33.220
She's had a confusing
upbringing. We can't expect her

08:33.260 --> 08:34.510
to be perfect from the start.

08:34.550 --> 08:35.890
[knocking]

08:36.470 --> 08:37.180
[Jake]
Hey!

08:37.220 --> 08:37.260
Buddy.

08:38.850 --> 08:42.180
If you're here for the modeling
gig, Flashy McPerve is...

08:43.020 --> 08:44.480
William Cadigan Clarke.

08:45.690 --> 08:47.400
[Jake] What the hell
are you doing here?

08:47.440 --> 08:48.730
People call me Bill now.

08:48.770 --> 08:51.150
Oh, you shortened it for
prison, did you? How cute.

08:51.190 --> 08:54.110
I'm a free man. You two leave
me alone or I call the cops.

08:54.150 --> 08:55.660
I'm sure they'll
come running.

08:55.700 --> 08:57.410
Look, I don't want
any trouble.

08:57.450 --> 09:00.620
I'm here visiting an old friend.
Looks like Elsa's not here.

09:00.660 --> 09:02.460
So I'll be on my way, okay?

09:03.210 --> 09:04.250
Oh, and Jake.

09:04.290 --> 09:05.670
Say hi to Leslie for me,
will you?

09:06.580 --> 09:08.170
I can't wait to see her again.

09:09.090 --> 09:09.960
What did you say?

09:10.800 --> 09:12.090
You can't wait to see her?

09:12.130 --> 09:12.880
Son. It's not worth it.

09:14.170 --> 09:17.180
Tell you what. If you
even go near Leslie--

09:17.800 --> 09:19.470
I will end you.

09:21.270 --> 09:22.640
Same old Jake, huh?

09:24.730 --> 09:25.890
[camera click]

09:25.940 --> 09:26.810
[camera click]

09:29.520 --> 09:31.400
Okay. That's a bit of
a coincidence.

09:31.440 --> 09:32.530
That Clarke showed up here.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.110
Either he's involved in this.

09:36.450 --> 09:37.490
Or he's following us.

09:37.530 --> 09:38.490
One or the other.

09:42.450 --> 09:44.160
I can't be locked
up here like this.

09:44.200 --> 09:45.500
Compared to Jake and Malachy,

09:45.540 --> 09:48.330
I may be relatively
new to the P.I. thing.

09:49.250 --> 09:50.040
I mean, I'm sort of a junior,

09:51.130 --> 09:52.750
semi-senior,
if you catch my drift.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.760
No. I don't. Why are you
telling me this?

09:54.800 --> 09:56.260
Well, you see, I've developed-

09:56.300 --> 09:59.140
a technique to help people in
your situation.

09:59.180 --> 10:00.890
Would you like to know more?
No pressure.

10:00.930 --> 10:01.890
- No.
- Okay so,

10:01.930 --> 10:02.930
What I do is I take the client,

10:02.970 --> 10:05.100
and I put them
under a microscope.

10:05.140 --> 10:07.600
Of sorts. Not an actual one.
That would be ridiculous.

10:07.640 --> 10:12.230
But on that examines anything
at all that might be relevant.

10:13.440 --> 10:17.320
Even your most intimate
secrets.

10:17.360 --> 10:18.570
Let's begin. So--

10:19.660 --> 10:22.990
You have been engaged
three times.

10:24.490 --> 10:26.660
But only married once.

10:28.870 --> 10:30.000
How do you know that?

10:30.040 --> 10:31.960
Did you do the breaking
up, or did they?

10:34.050 --> 10:35.170
You were dumped.

10:35.210 --> 10:37.510
That is always tough.

10:38.880 --> 10:39.800
Now.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.720
I see you have no record.
But...

10:43.640 --> 10:45.390
- But what?
- But there were

10:45.430 --> 10:48.350
several links of disturbances
to your address.

10:48.390 --> 10:50.770
Now, no judgments.
But is Curtis abusive?

10:50.810 --> 10:55.570
Curtis? No.
I have been known on occasion

10:55.610 --> 10:57.610
to smash up
my husband's art work.

10:58.650 --> 11:00.240
- to make a point.
- What point?

11:00.280 --> 11:02.320
That he's a freeloading
son of a bitch.

11:02.370 --> 11:08.160
Okay, temper. Ah, a temper can
lead to several enemies.

11:08.200 --> 11:10.040
Including your husband. But
he's already a suspect.

11:10.080 --> 11:11.460
I do not have a temper.

11:11.500 --> 11:12.750
Don't go around telling
people that.

11:12.790 --> 11:13.710
I won't. Of course I won't.

11:13.750 --> 11:14.750
Unless people come asking.

11:14.790 --> 11:16.050
Now, on to your
business dealings.

11:16.090 --> 11:16.710
You know what?
I'm leaving.

11:18.010 --> 11:19.970
Tell Mal and whatever
his name is, to hurry up

11:20.010 --> 11:21.800
and find out who's blowing
stuff up around me.

11:21.840 --> 11:22.720
Okay.

11:26.770 --> 11:28.890
Hey. Jake. It's me. Um--

11:29.810 --> 11:31.940
Elsa took off. I'm not sure why.

11:31.980 --> 11:34.020
So I'm gonna tail her.
I'll keep you posted. Bye.

11:39.490 --> 11:41.320
- I'm heading out.
- No you're not. Sit down.

11:41.360 --> 11:42.780
Please. Don't make
a big thing of it.

11:42.820 --> 11:44.410
I had a boy stay over.
So what?

11:44.450 --> 11:45.910
So what? Really?

11:45.950 --> 11:47.660
You think that's where I'm
gonna leave this whole thing?

11:47.700 --> 11:48.700
It's none of your business.
So...

11:49.540 --> 11:50.960
Before you say another word,

11:51.000 --> 11:53.790
think about how disrespectful
you're being. And stop.

11:57.630 --> 12:01.510
I'm not an idiot, my dear. Nor
am I a Stepford wife.

12:01.550 --> 12:03.640
I know that you had
a man in your bed.

12:03.680 --> 12:04.800
And that he slept over.

12:04.840 --> 12:06.390
We didn't do a whole lot of
sleeping.

12:06.430 --> 12:08.180
Don't be crass, Sloan.
You're only sixteen.

12:08.850 --> 12:10.060
Just say you're sorry.

12:10.100 --> 12:11.560
And tell me
you're not gonna invite people

12:11.600 --> 12:13.600
into our house without
our knowledge.

12:13.650 --> 12:14.850
Oh right.
Because if you had known,

12:14.900 --> 12:16.650
you'd have left out
a towel and a toothbrush.

12:16.690 --> 12:21.280
And that you'll respect your
grandfather and this house.

12:21.320 --> 12:23.740
And me, and the rest of
your family.

12:30.160 --> 12:31.370
It was stupid.

12:32.660 --> 12:37.130
Honestly. We had
nowhere to go.

12:38.500 --> 12:41.210
And I figured you were cool.
And you'd rather me

12:41.260 --> 12:44.220
be here than somewhere else.
And we didn't do anything.

12:44.260 --> 12:45.890
- Don't patronize me.
- I'm not.

12:46.430 --> 12:47.430
I wouldn't.

12:48.850 --> 12:50.390
He wanted to do stuff.

12:50.430 --> 12:51.850
That's part of the reason
I brought him here.

12:52.560 --> 12:53.640
So I'd have an out.

12:56.400 --> 13:00.610
Well. I'll let you know if I
decide to tell Jake about this.

13:02.320 --> 13:03.650
It will never happen again.

13:03.700 --> 13:04.660
Oh, I know that.

13:16.420 --> 13:17.830
So you've heard?

13:17.880 --> 13:20.670
Clarke is out on good behavior,
can you believe that?

13:20.710 --> 13:22.550
Our paths crossed on a case
I'm working on.

13:22.590 --> 13:25.340
Looks like he's working with a
known loan shark. Her name is--

13:25.380 --> 13:26.300
Harley Denief.

13:26.340 --> 13:28.140
Harley. Yeah. Harley Denief.

13:28.180 --> 13:30.100
Yeah. I'm familiar with her.

13:30.140 --> 13:31.680
Clarke's prison visiting
records.

13:31.720 --> 13:33.310
Thanks Hood, and, um--

13:33.350 --> 13:36.150
I know. It's all on the QT.
I really hate this guy.

13:37.400 --> 13:38.650
Looks like Harley was
a regular visitor.

13:39.860 --> 13:42.230
She saw Clarke on six separate
occasions.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.440
So they've been working on
something for a long time.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.490
I'll keep you posted if I find
anything else.

13:46.530 --> 13:48.490
Okay thanks. Oh, and Leslie--

13:48.530 --> 13:50.330
- Yeah? - I just--

13:51.950 --> 13:52.830
I miss you.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.080
Just--

13:57.210 --> 13:59.210
Did you guys take this
picture?

13:59.250 --> 14:01.840
No, Mr. Brogan. But a fairly
reliable source did.

14:01.880 --> 14:03.840
Ah. Elsa's idiot husband.

14:05.130 --> 14:07.380
He'll sink her business if
she's not careful.

14:09.140 --> 14:09.760
None of that matters,
does it?

14:10.640 --> 14:12.060
In the end I'll get the contract

14:12.100 --> 14:13.770
just like I should have
gotten it in the first place.

14:13.810 --> 14:16.140
I suppose it's safe to say that

14:16.180 --> 14:18.600
you'd have a lot to gain
if something happened to Elsa.

14:18.650 --> 14:19.940
Let's not get dramatic.

14:19.980 --> 14:21.690
Dramatics aside.

14:21.730 --> 14:23.940
It must sting. You
lose the contract.

14:23.980 --> 14:25.740
And then you ended up
working for her.

14:25.780 --> 14:29.030
In the picture, it looks like
you're arguing.

14:29.070 --> 14:30.160
What was that all about?

14:31.780 --> 14:35.620
Elsa subcontracted some of the
work to me. We were discussing--

14:35.660 --> 14:38.620
some cost overruns and which
one of us would pay for them.

14:38.670 --> 14:40.170
She's got a bit of a temper.
So do I.

14:40.880 --> 14:41.920
It's just business.

14:43.170 --> 14:46.170
Alright. Do you know
of any other contractors

14:46.210 --> 14:47.590
who might have
a grudge against Elsa?

14:47.630 --> 14:49.720
Let's put it this way.
I'm not the kinda guy to write

14:49.760 --> 14:51.100
"cheater" on
the back of her car.

14:51.930 --> 14:54.100
Talk to the moron husband.

14:54.140 --> 14:55.310
I got a terminal to finish.

14:55.350 --> 14:56.810
See yourselves out, would ya?

14:59.310 --> 15:01.350
[Jake] Obviously I might be
reading too much into this,

15:01.400 --> 15:03.440
but why else would Clarke
have been at Elsa's,

15:03.480 --> 15:05.400
if he's not tangled up in
this somehow?

15:05.440 --> 15:07.360
[ring]

15:09.400 --> 15:10.320
Des.

15:10.360 --> 15:12.160
Hey. I've been following Elsa.

15:12.200 --> 15:14.950
And it looks like Clarke and
that Harley missus are too.

15:14.990 --> 15:18.290
Because they're pulling in,
in their Hummer right now.

15:25.340 --> 15:26.800
And they're kidnapping her.

15:26.840 --> 15:28.970
Follow them and
send us a location.

15:29.010 --> 15:31.010
Clarke kidnapped
Elsa. Let's go.

15:32.140 --> 15:33.100
Come on.

15:40.060 --> 15:41.560
Clarke's got Elsa. Why?

15:42.060 --> 15:43.150
Turn here.

15:46.570 --> 15:48.150
Tell Des to fall back.

15:53.990 --> 15:55.160
What the hell are they doing?

15:57.370 --> 15:58.290
Slow down, b'y. You're gonna
pass them.

15:59.620 --> 16:01.250
There's something wrong
with the brakes, Dad.

16:01.290 --> 16:02.120
I think they're cut!

16:02.870 --> 16:04.790
Watch it!
Gear down.

16:04.830 --> 16:06.630
Yes b'y. And tear the
engine right out of her.

16:06.670 --> 16:08.380
This car has been through
enough already.

16:08.420 --> 16:09.090
The car.
Shag the car, Jake.

16:10.010 --> 16:11.630
We can't let anyone get hurt!

16:23.900 --> 16:26.190
I knew Clarke was
involved in all this.

16:26.230 --> 16:28.690
You think he's responsible for
the attacks on Elsa?

16:28.730 --> 16:29.690
Why else would he take her?

16:29.730 --> 16:30.490
Should we call the cops,
at least?

16:30.530 --> 16:32.030
And report the kidnapping.

16:32.070 --> 16:34.200
We could. But then if Clarke
finds out it might spook him.

16:34.240 --> 16:35.700
And he could hurt her.

16:35.740 --> 16:37.830
[Jake] Harley is
our way to Clarke.

16:38.540 --> 16:40.870
Clarke. He has Elsa.

16:41.870 --> 16:42.750
[female voice]
Really.

16:44.120 --> 16:45.040
Boys.

16:46.130 --> 16:46.920
I didn't cut your brakes.

16:47.840 --> 16:48.840
I wanted you to
know that.

16:48.880 --> 16:49.710
Who did?

16:50.510 --> 16:52.630
You're not gonna tell us?

16:52.670 --> 16:53.550
Why are you working with
Clarke?

16:53.590 --> 16:54.760
He hired me.

16:54.800 --> 16:56.590
- To do what?
- To help him get money back

16:56.640 --> 16:58.930
that he's owed
from people around town.

16:58.970 --> 17:00.350
From his time in office.

17:01.270 --> 17:03.140
Money in exchange for favors.

17:03.180 --> 17:04.100
That's disgusting.

17:04.140 --> 17:05.100
[Jake]
Kickbacks.

17:05.150 --> 17:06.440
Des. She means
kickbacks.

17:06.480 --> 17:08.980
I though Clarke ratted
everyone out at the trial.

17:09.020 --> 17:10.070
Not everyone.

17:10.110 --> 17:11.990
Ah, so he left
some people out of it.

17:12.030 --> 17:12.610
And now he's running around town

17:13.860 --> 17:15.200
collecting money
for keeping his mouth shut.

17:16.450 --> 17:18.200
[Mal] Elsa's company got
the airport contract

17:18.240 --> 17:19.950
in exchange for a kickback
to Clarke.

17:19.990 --> 17:21.450
And now he wants
her to pay up.

17:21.490 --> 17:23.370
Something isn't
adding up here.

17:23.410 --> 17:24.870
Clarke is not gonna hurt Elsa.

17:24.910 --> 17:26.250
That way he won't
get any money out of her.

17:27.000 --> 17:27.420
What are you doing here?

17:28.210 --> 17:28.630
Why are you helping us?

17:29.630 --> 17:32.550
I'm a business woman.
But this?

17:34.720 --> 17:37.390
This is all too personal
for my liking.

17:37.430 --> 17:39.300
You're a hired gun with
a conscience.

17:39.350 --> 17:40.850
All I'm saying is that you guys
really did a number on Clarke.

17:42.430 --> 17:45.390
He's a changed man. I don't
know what he's gonna do next.

17:46.520 --> 17:47.940
Just came to give you
fair warning.

17:47.980 --> 17:49.520
Where is he keeping Elsa?

17:51.270 --> 17:54.900
Clarke wants his money.
Elsa's got a safe at her house.

17:55.490 --> 17:56.820
You do the math.

18:01.120 --> 18:01.950
[Mal]
Elsa?

18:03.080 --> 18:04.580
Hands where we can see
them, Clarke.

18:04.620 --> 18:07.000
Easy. Single malt.

18:07.040 --> 18:07.960
- Where's Elsa?
- A toast.

18:09.130 --> 18:11.590
Jake Doyle.
Dumbest guy I've ever met.

18:12.920 --> 18:15.460
We know you've been
running around with Harley

18:15.510 --> 18:17.590
collecting all your
old kickback debts.

18:17.630 --> 18:20.760
Do you, now? So do
you have proof?

18:20.800 --> 18:22.390
Hearsay? Anything?

18:23.680 --> 18:25.390
- Are you okay?
- Yes I'm fine.

18:25.430 --> 18:28.600
Hello police? I have an
intruder in my home.

18:28.650 --> 18:30.940
B and E. Maybe kidnapping.

18:31.820 --> 18:32.940
Looks like you broke parole.

18:32.980 --> 18:34.530
You're going back to
prison, buddy.

18:34.570 --> 18:35.780
[Elsa]
Yes I know them.

18:36.650 --> 18:38.410
It's Jake and Malachy Doyle.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.240
What's up?

18:44.290 --> 18:46.040
I'm just doing a pass on the
books for you.

18:46.080 --> 18:47.540
There's something really odd
here.

18:47.580 --> 18:48.920
Oh. What?

18:48.960 --> 18:51.080
We're missing twenty
thousand dollars.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.040
Twenty grand.

18:52.090 --> 18:53.420
How is that possible?

18:53.460 --> 18:54.670
I have no idea.

18:59.720 --> 19:03.180
Oh. I bet you Jake took it.

19:03.220 --> 19:05.010
He sometimes dips into the till.

19:05.060 --> 19:08.100
Maybe he's got it involved
in some case right now.

19:08.140 --> 19:09.940
No. He asked me earlier today

19:09.980 --> 19:12.150
if I brought any cash to
the bank for an early deposit.

19:12.190 --> 19:14.360
I'm pretty sure he
didn't take it.

19:15.280 --> 19:15.940
[Sloan]
Who died?

19:17.360 --> 19:19.280
Oh my God. Did someone
actually die? I was joking.

19:19.320 --> 19:20.360
[Rose]
No.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.070
We're dealing with a tax
issue right now.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.910
It's boring stuff.

19:32.000 --> 19:32.790
Well, well, well.

19:33.380 --> 19:34.590
Look who's here.

19:34.630 --> 19:35.750
Jake Doyle.

19:36.840 --> 19:38.380
Why am I not surprised
to see you?

19:38.420 --> 19:38.510
Valerie.

19:39.670 --> 19:41.340
I haven't seen you since
the Academy days.

19:42.430 --> 19:44.600
You look great
And congratulations.

19:44.640 --> 19:45.970
Apparently you got the
top job, huh?

19:46.010 --> 19:46.060
One of them.

19:47.600 --> 19:50.190
And this is me exercising
my authority. You have to leave.

19:50.230 --> 19:51.770
No, no. Elsa hired us.

19:51.810 --> 19:53.520
She's our client.
We need to be close.

19:53.560 --> 19:56.020
That's funny. Because she asked
us to keep you away from her.

19:56.070 --> 19:58.150
Leslie, Elsa hired us. Okay?

19:58.190 --> 19:59.030
She was being threatened.

19:59.070 --> 20:00.400
[Valerie]
She seems to think

20:00.450 --> 20:03.610
it's all a misunderstanding.
A prank. So, gotta go.

20:03.660 --> 20:05.120
We were there. She
was almost killed.

20:05.160 --> 20:06.660
[Mal]
Elsa owes Clarke money.

20:06.700 --> 20:07.950
She's probably afraid
she'd go down

20:07.990 --> 20:09.620
for bribing her way
to a contract.

20:09.660 --> 20:11.120
You're gonna have to back off
the case. Including Clarke.

20:12.540 --> 20:14.000
[Valerie] After all these
years, it would be a shame

20:14.040 --> 20:15.500
if our reunion
consists of me having

20:15.540 --> 20:17.630
to lock you up for harassment.

20:17.670 --> 20:18.550
Elsa.

20:19.260 --> 20:20.510
We know what Clarke

20:20.550 --> 20:22.720
has on you. Why don't
you just level with us?

20:22.760 --> 20:24.180
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

20:24.220 --> 20:25.430
Just send me the bill.
You're fired.

20:26.640 --> 20:28.140
You don't know what
you're dealing with.

20:28.180 --> 20:30.140
- You need our help.
- I'll be fine.

20:30.180 --> 20:31.480
Which is more than
I can say for you,

20:31.520 --> 20:32.980
unless you stay away from me.

20:36.400 --> 20:37.400
[click]

20:37.440 --> 20:38.730
Maybe we should stay clear.

20:38.770 --> 20:40.400
It's not like
we got a client any more.

20:40.440 --> 20:41.440
[click]

20:41.490 --> 20:42.450
I don't know.

20:43.820 --> 20:44.700
Maybe.

20:45.160 --> 20:46.030
[click]

20:55.830 --> 20:57.080
Des, what?

20:57.130 --> 20:57.630
I checked into Elsa's
finances.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.710
It turns out she field for
bankruptcy protection.

21:00.760 --> 21:01.920
Elsa's broke?

21:01.960 --> 21:02.670
- Yeah it seem that way. - Okay, good work.

21:04.180 --> 21:06.340
Keep me posted if you find out
anything else, all right?

21:06.390 --> 21:07.510
Oh, oh. And um.

21:07.550 --> 21:09.850
And, just so you know,

21:09.890 --> 21:11.970
I think we're gonna have to
use the bathroom in the Duke

21:12.020 --> 21:13.390
just for a little while. Bye.

21:19.940 --> 21:20.940
Well, now.

21:29.070 --> 21:31.410
I don't think this could get
any more awkward.

21:31.450 --> 21:32.410
[door opens]

21:32.450 --> 21:33.750
And it just did.

21:35.290 --> 21:35.500
What are you doing?

21:36.630 --> 21:38.920
[audio of Elsa and Curtis
making out]

21:43.760 --> 21:45.680
There wasn't a lot of foreplay
before they...

21:46.590 --> 21:48.300
I couldn't...
How are you?

21:49.720 --> 21:51.350
I knew you couldn't leave
this alone.

21:51.390 --> 21:53.970
Elsa's life's in danger.
And I hate Clarke.

21:54.020 --> 21:58.400
So it's kinda like killing two
birds and getting stoned.

22:00.060 --> 22:03.490
Well, I wanna take down Clarke
as much as you.

22:07.860 --> 22:08.370
[audio still plays]

22:09.450 --> 22:11.580
We both got a
lot invested in him.

22:14.120 --> 22:15.870
It's hot in here.

22:26.760 --> 22:27.630
How are you?

22:28.300 --> 22:28.970
Fine.

22:29.890 --> 22:33.180
You didn't take the promotion.

22:33.560 --> 22:34.470
No.

22:34.520 --> 22:34.930
Is that because of me?

22:35.890 --> 22:37.390
You think some lot
of yourself.

22:37.440 --> 22:40.610
Don't ya? It's more along the
lines of too much paperwork.

22:41.310 --> 22:42.400
Not enough cop work.

22:42.440 --> 22:44.990
And not enough time off.

22:47.450 --> 22:49.110
You really think you
should be here.

22:50.200 --> 22:51.320
I'm off duty.

22:54.160 --> 22:55.660
And I'm off
tomorrow too.

22:59.170 --> 23:00.460
I don't know how to
turn off the--

23:01.290 --> 23:03.090
[speakers crash again]

23:07.970 --> 23:09.760
It's been a while since
we've been like this.

23:12.760 --> 23:13.800
Yes, it has.

23:13.850 --> 23:15.680
It's nice to have a
moment with you.

23:18.270 --> 23:19.480
A second alone anyway.

23:22.190 --> 23:24.320
I've really.
I've missed our--

23:26.190 --> 23:31.700
The time that we would have...
we used to have together.

23:34.070 --> 23:36.870
I know exactly what you mean,
Jake. I feel it too.

24:01.770 --> 24:03.020
I missed you so much.

24:03.730 --> 24:04.730
I missed you too.

24:15.870 --> 24:16.790
I love you, Jake.

24:17.790 --> 24:20.460
I love you. I love
you so much.

24:48.440 --> 24:49.320
Hello there.

24:50.570 --> 24:51.860
Hello yourself.

24:56.280 --> 24:57.160
Thank you.

25:06.130 --> 25:07.290
So.

25:07.330 --> 25:09.000
It's okay Jake. We
don't have to talk.

25:09.800 --> 25:10.420
Are you out of your mind?

25:11.670 --> 25:13.800
I've been waiting
to talk to you for months.

25:13.840 --> 25:15.930
It feels like maybe
even my entire life.

25:16.970 --> 25:20.680
Okay. What do you
wanna talk about?

25:24.890 --> 25:25.770
Look.

25:27.940 --> 25:30.820
Leslie, you know how I
feel about you.

25:32.150 --> 25:33.570
Given the recent events,

25:33.610 --> 25:36.240
I'm pretty sure that
you might feel the same way.

25:38.490 --> 25:39.530
I do.

25:40.700 --> 25:42.080
I feel the same. I do.

25:44.710 --> 25:45.920
I just think that,

25:48.880 --> 25:49.790
you and me.

25:52.300 --> 25:53.590
I mean, shouldn't we just be--

25:53.630 --> 25:54.720
[Elsa on camera] Separated.

25:54.760 --> 25:56.680
We are separated.
You wonder why?

25:56.720 --> 25:58.090
Because
you're incompetent.

25:58.140 --> 26:00.640
I asked you to do one thing.

26:00.680 --> 26:04.480
[Curtis] Temper! Temper!
I can take care of it.

26:04.520 --> 26:06.020
Shut up, Curtis.

26:06.060 --> 26:08.310
I'll do it, Elsa.
I will! I will!

26:08.350 --> 26:10.110
We need the money. Go.

26:12.150 --> 26:14.280
[Jake]
So. What do you wanna do?

26:14.320 --> 26:15.280
Follow him.

26:16.700 --> 26:17.910
Alrighty then.

26:41.010 --> 26:42.680
[Leslie] What's
Curtis looking for?

26:42.720 --> 26:45.270
I have no idea.
I'll go find out.

26:58.280 --> 26:59.360
Curtis.

26:59.410 --> 27:01.070
No, no, no. This
isn't happening.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.120
Yes it is.

27:02.160 --> 27:03.660
Actually,
what's happening is--

27:03.700 --> 27:05.830
You're stealing from your
wife's job site.

27:05.870 --> 27:07.290
No, look--

27:07.330 --> 27:09.170
We got a load of highly
explosive explosives in there.

27:10.540 --> 27:12.250
And I was moving them.
because they're dangerous.

27:12.290 --> 27:14.800
You're moving them because your
wife told you to sell them.

27:14.840 --> 27:15.760
Isn't that right?

27:15.800 --> 27:18.760
How did you--
No, no, no.

27:18.800 --> 27:20.050
Curtis.

27:20.090 --> 27:21.930
Who are you selling the
explosives to? Clarke?

27:22.890 --> 27:24.100
We really need
the money, okay?

27:24.140 --> 27:25.510
You're gonna want to
put down that box,

27:25.560 --> 27:27.890
and step slowly
away from the vehicle.

27:27.930 --> 27:29.480
Put your hands where
I can see them.

27:29.520 --> 27:29.850
What?

27:30.650 --> 27:32.100
I'm not doing anything.

27:32.150 --> 27:33.980
Look, he wanted
the explosives.

27:34.020 --> 27:36.230
I don't know why.
But, Elsa and me--

27:36.280 --> 27:37.740
We had no choice
but to sell them to him.

27:37.780 --> 27:38.690
Who?

27:38.740 --> 27:40.280
Are you talking about Clarke?

27:41.570 --> 27:42.410
Stop!

27:43.320 --> 27:44.490
[Jake]
What are you doing?

27:44.530 --> 27:45.700
Curtis, come on!

27:46.450 --> 27:47.450
What a tool.

27:48.080 --> 27:49.620
[tires screech]

27:52.250 --> 27:53.130
[crash]

28:00.170 --> 28:02.590
Curtis. Are you okay?

28:05.300 --> 28:05.890
Ah...

28:06.600 --> 28:07.720
That's a bullet hole.

28:07.770 --> 28:09.680
And I don't think
it came from the crash.

28:10.600 --> 28:12.150
Where did the shot come from?

28:17.820 --> 28:19.610
This place had enough TNT
to take out the airport.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.990
I know that Curtis was gonna
sell those explosives to Clarke.

28:25.320 --> 28:27.290
[Valerie] So this is how
you spend your day off?

28:28.290 --> 28:29.250
You okay?

28:29.830 --> 28:30.710
Yeah. Fine.

28:32.290 --> 28:34.790
We're still trying to figure
out the shooter's vantage point.

28:34.830 --> 28:35.670
We're combing the area.

28:35.710 --> 28:35.750
If I may--

28:37.300 --> 28:38.510
Obviously we know that
this is the bullet hole, right?

28:39.460 --> 28:40.920
And I'm pretty sure
the shooter

28:40.960 --> 28:43.260
was on top of that second
building on the rooftop there.

28:44.260 --> 28:45.590
You always had a
good eye, Jake.

28:45.640 --> 28:46.850
Good luck finding
any evidence.

28:46.890 --> 28:48.720
I mean this guy was a pro.

28:48.760 --> 28:50.140
Besides, he was brazen enough

28:50.180 --> 28:51.310
to take a shot
right in front of a cop.

28:51.350 --> 28:52.520
He wasn't messing around.

28:52.560 --> 28:53.690
Alright.

28:53.730 --> 28:55.230
Make sure we get all of
the explosives.

28:55.270 --> 28:57.570
Process them and bring them
down to the disposal facility.

28:57.610 --> 28:58.480
Got it.

29:03.030 --> 29:03.530
Are you hurt?

29:04.160 --> 29:05.860
No, we're fine.

29:05.910 --> 29:08.660
Good. I only have so much
family leave left.

29:08.700 --> 29:10.240
Any luck searching for Elsa?

29:10.290 --> 29:12.370
No, but we've got people
canvassing the neighborhood.

29:12.410 --> 29:13.710
We'll head down to
her place, then.

29:13.750 --> 29:15.460
Okay. See you guys later.

29:15.500 --> 29:16.080
Bye. Love you.

29:17.340 --> 29:19.340
You gotta say it back, or it
doesn't count.

29:19.380 --> 29:20.710
Tinny. No?

29:22.460 --> 29:24.180
You do have a way with kids,
you know.

29:25.630 --> 29:26.720
Tinny's far from a kid.

29:26.760 --> 29:27.850
Yeah, but she was.

29:27.890 --> 29:28.600
And she looks
up to you.

29:29.720 --> 29:30.850
And I see the way you are
with Sloan.

29:31.560 --> 29:33.180
Are you trying to tell me

29:33.230 --> 29:36.770
that maybe you're reconsidering
the whole having babies with me?

29:38.400 --> 29:41.480
Who said I needed to reconsider
anything in the first place?

29:55.000 --> 29:56.370
You met Rose, right?

29:56.420 --> 29:57.880
The fiery lady who
caught me in my bed?

29:57.920 --> 29:59.380
She'll kill you
if she finds you here.

29:59.420 --> 30:01.880
We got bigger problems than
your fake family right now.

30:01.920 --> 30:04.510
Shut up, Luke.
Stop being such a wimp.

30:04.550 --> 30:05.220
Give Saul the money I gave
you. He'll lay off.

30:06.630 --> 30:08.590
You're messing with the wrong
people here, Sloan.

30:08.640 --> 30:08.800
I can handle Saul.

30:10.220 --> 30:13.350
I hope so. Because he wants
to see you right now.

30:17.190 --> 30:18.400
[Leslie]
She didn't set her alarm.

30:19.310 --> 30:21.070
She must have left in a hurry.

30:22.230 --> 30:23.360
Do you think she's
skipped town?

30:23.400 --> 30:24.610
[Jake]
That depends.

30:24.650 --> 30:27.740
Maybe she heard that Curtis
was dead.

30:27.780 --> 30:30.740
Unless she was the shooter.
Which is unlikely.

30:30.780 --> 30:32.040
Is Clarke any good with a gun?

30:32.740 --> 30:34.540
Not that I know of.

30:34.580 --> 30:36.040
But he was full of surprises.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.000
You don't hear a dog, do you?

30:38.920 --> 30:40.750
No. Probably took it with her.

30:40.790 --> 30:42.050
Let's hope so.

30:43.340 --> 30:45.130
There's a dog tracker
on his collar.

30:45.170 --> 30:46.510
Maybe..

30:46.550 --> 30:48.510
If she's got the dog with
her--

30:49.590 --> 30:50.930
There's the pet tracking
program.

30:50.970 --> 30:51.890
[beeping]

30:54.060 --> 30:54.930
That's weird.

31:00.650 --> 31:03.360
I got the coordinates for our
furry little friend here.

31:04.570 --> 31:05.780
Leslie, get back!

31:06.320 --> 31:07.490
[explosion]

31:10.320 --> 31:11.530
That's one hell of an alarm.

31:11.570 --> 31:12.450
[ring]

31:13.780 --> 31:15.790
Someone wants Elsa dead.
But who?

31:17.410 --> 31:18.500
Des.

31:18.540 --> 31:20.790
Jake. Clarke is here.
He's at the Duke.

31:20.830 --> 31:22.080
Hey, everybody!

31:22.130 --> 31:25.170
Gather round, Come on!
Drinks are on me.

31:25.210 --> 31:26.170
[crown cheers]

31:26.210 --> 31:27.590
What the hell
is he doing there?

31:27.630 --> 31:29.880
He's buying rounds for everyone
including reporters.

31:29.930 --> 31:30.800
It's like he's celebrating.

31:32.010 --> 31:34.010
Listen to me. I need
you to find Dad.

31:34.050 --> 31:37.100
I'm gonna text you Elsa's
coordinates.

31:37.890 --> 31:38.060
Hurry.

31:39.440 --> 31:41.560
Clarke is at the Duke with
a bunch of reporters.

31:41.600 --> 31:43.110
We gotta talk to him now.

31:50.150 --> 31:51.820
- Milo.
- [Des] He's safe.

31:52.280 --> 31:53.200
For now.

31:53.870 --> 31:55.660
Get out of my car.

31:56.990 --> 31:58.200
We need to talk.

31:58.250 --> 31:58.790
You need to leave me alone.

31:58.830 --> 32:00.210
Elsa.

32:00.250 --> 32:02.250
Your husband is dead.
And you're in danger. Please.

32:03.170 --> 32:05.000
You need to
come with us.

32:05.040 --> 32:05.920
[Elsa]
What?

32:06.880 --> 32:07.960
Curtis is--

32:09.420 --> 32:10.090
Curtis is dead?

32:10.720 --> 32:11.630
Yes. I'm sorry.

32:12.260 --> 32:14.350
No. Who did this?

32:14.390 --> 32:14.850
You tell us.

32:15.760 --> 32:17.850
Look. They're not gonna stop.

32:17.890 --> 32:19.350
If Clarke's behind this--

32:19.390 --> 32:21.310
You've gotta come clean
to the cops.

32:21.350 --> 32:21.390
I didn't--

32:22.600 --> 32:24.900
I didn't mean for
any of this to happen.

32:25.610 --> 32:26.860
It's gonna be okay.

32:26.900 --> 32:28.400
But you need to come with
me right now.

32:29.030 --> 32:30.030
Des. Follow us.

32:30.070 --> 32:31.610
He can't smell fear, can he?

32:36.410 --> 32:37.790
[Clarke] That's what
municipal politics is.

32:37.830 --> 32:38.620
It's a snake pit.

32:39.450 --> 32:40.790
And you have to get used--

32:41.290 --> 32:41.330
Jake Doyle.

32:42.460 --> 32:44.380
I knew you'd stop by
sooner or later.

32:44.920 --> 32:45.920
And Leslie.

32:46.540 --> 32:47.710
That's a bonus.

32:47.750 --> 32:50.130
Such a great, great
piece of ass you are.

32:50.720 --> 32:52.090
Oh man. You--

32:53.840 --> 32:55.390
You're gonna stop talking
right now

32:55.430 --> 32:58.180
Well, I'm not the same guy that
you knew before, Jake.

32:58.760 --> 32:59.890
I've changed.

32:59.930 --> 33:01.020
You think I'm scared of you

33:01.060 --> 33:02.770
because you did a little time,
Clarke?

33:04.940 --> 33:07.230
I will wipe this floor up
with your face,

33:08.320 --> 33:09.940
if you say one more thing--

33:09.980 --> 33:11.780
directed towards her.
Do you understand?

33:11.820 --> 33:14.400
Yeah, I do.

33:14.450 --> 33:15.240
[Leslie] Bill, we know
about the kickbacks.

33:16.530 --> 33:18.330
And about Elsa's involvement
in all of that.

33:18.370 --> 33:19.620
I've already
been tried for that.

33:19.660 --> 33:20.950
That's double jeopardy.
You ever hear of that?

33:20.990 --> 33:23.160
I'm answering the
lady's question.

33:23.200 --> 33:25.460
We need to talk to you about
the murder of Curtis Mercer.

33:25.500 --> 33:27.340
And about a bombing
at Elsa Tessier's house.

33:27.380 --> 33:27.420
A bomb.

33:28.920 --> 33:31.250
Where would you think I
learned how to make a bomb?

33:31.300 --> 33:32.840
Because I don't think that's
part of

33:32.880 --> 33:34.630
the correctional
education program.

33:34.680 --> 33:35.800
[laughing]

33:36.760 --> 33:38.720
It's a crazy story,
Sergeant.

33:38.760 --> 33:40.970
You know what? I thought you'd
be a shoe-in for inspector.

33:41.020 --> 33:43.140
But I did my part.

33:43.180 --> 33:44.640
Sleeping with
the mayor. Bringing him down--

33:44.680 --> 33:45.980
Should have fast tracked things
for you. Maybe--

33:47.310 --> 33:49.610
Sleeping with Jake kinda
cancels that out for you.

33:49.650 --> 33:50.530
[punch]

33:51.940 --> 33:52.860
[laughing]

33:52.900 --> 33:54.150
I warned you about that.

33:55.450 --> 33:56.320
You did.

33:57.620 --> 33:58.700
Time to go.

34:00.620 --> 34:01.540
It's okay Jake.

34:01.580 --> 34:03.080
Stand down, okay?

34:08.000 --> 34:08.960
Jake.

34:15.840 --> 34:16.760
Alright Bill.

34:18.220 --> 34:18.850
You win.

34:20.100 --> 34:21.810
I just hope you got
an alibi, that's all.

34:21.850 --> 34:22.180
Yeah.

34:22.810 --> 34:24.140
Been here all day.

34:24.180 --> 34:26.350
I got fifty witnesses. You're
bartender included.

34:26.390 --> 34:27.600
They can corroborate my story.

34:28.810 --> 34:30.520
Oh. Some reporters
here too, Jake.

34:31.980 --> 34:34.530
If we even smell your
involvement in all this, Bill.

34:34.570 --> 34:35.900
You're going down.

34:37.700 --> 34:38.570
Slut.

34:39.490 --> 34:40.370
[punch]

34:57.300 --> 34:59.090
[Elsa] I don't know
who killed Curtis.

34:59.130 --> 35:00.640
Or who's trying to
hurt me.

35:00.680 --> 35:02.430
So who were you planning on
selling the explosives to?

35:02.760 --> 35:03.970
What?

35:04.010 --> 35:05.390
[Valerie] We know all
about the kick back

35:05.430 --> 35:07.270
you gave Clarke in order to
get the airport contract.

35:07.310 --> 35:08.440
[Leslie]
And that he was out

35:08.480 --> 35:10.310
to collect. For keeping
quiet about it.

35:12.060 --> 35:15.860
Okay. Yes. But I couldn't pay
Clarke. I don't have the cash.

35:15.900 --> 35:18.320
Because you're company is
bankrupt.

35:18.360 --> 35:20.030
So you arranged
to sell large amounts

35:20.070 --> 35:22.200
of explosives you were
using on the job site.

35:22.240 --> 35:25.120
I literally have no idea what
you're talking about.

35:25.160 --> 35:28.660
Curtis was killed just before
he told us who the buyer is.

35:28.710 --> 35:32.840
So whoever it is wanted your
husband silent for good.

35:34.590 --> 35:37.880
Look. Curtis drove me crazy.
But--

35:37.920 --> 35:39.050
Deep down I loved him.

35:39.970 --> 35:41.760
I never meant for him to die.

35:41.800 --> 35:42.760
[Leslie]
Come on, Elsa.

35:42.800 --> 35:44.930
You know who's
behind this.

35:44.970 --> 35:45.930
[Valerie]
Tell us.

35:48.850 --> 35:50.020
The man you want
me to betray--

35:50.060 --> 35:52.190
is far more dangerous
than you.

35:53.060 --> 35:54.270
I'm not saying another word.

35:54.770 --> 35:55.650
[knocking]

35:56.730 --> 35:58.070
Now--

35:58.110 --> 36:01.570
If you'll excuse us. I need
to speak with my lawyer.

36:09.790 --> 36:10.920
How much is here?

36:12.210 --> 36:13.130
Twenty.

36:13.170 --> 36:14.080
Very good.

36:14.130 --> 36:15.210
How much
do you owe me?

36:15.250 --> 36:17.340
We borrowed thirty.
Plus interest.

36:17.380 --> 36:20.970
Which is forty. This is twenty.
Do you see a problem here?

36:21.010 --> 36:22.050
I can get the rest.

36:22.090 --> 36:23.930
Don't talk now.
Understand?

36:26.760 --> 36:27.640
Kent.

36:35.110 --> 36:35.900
Twenty grand. Two days.

36:37.190 --> 36:39.610
Or you're going to start
to see my charming side.

36:40.570 --> 36:41.110
Honey.

36:42.280 --> 36:44.870
You do not want to see
my charming side.

36:47.780 --> 36:49.330
[Jake] Has anyone heard
from my daughter today?

36:49.370 --> 36:50.450
[Rose]
Sloan.

36:50.500 --> 36:52.040
Ah, yes. She
should be at school.

36:52.080 --> 36:53.000
I've been calling for hours.

36:53.040 --> 36:54.210
[Mal]
Jake, focus.

36:54.250 --> 36:56.750
Clarke has zero history with
guns or bombs.

36:57.880 --> 36:59.170
He might have been
shaking down Elsa,

36:59.210 --> 37:01.220
But I don't think he could
have killed Curtis.

37:01.260 --> 37:02.300
His name's Milo.

37:03.510 --> 37:05.510
Harley has
a background of violence.

37:05.550 --> 37:07.100
But I don't think
she's that good of a shot.

37:07.140 --> 37:08.430
What do we know about Brogan?

37:08.470 --> 37:10.600
Brogan. He's just a...

37:10.640 --> 37:11.810
An electrician by trade.

37:11.850 --> 37:13.770
He lost the contract to Elsa.

37:13.810 --> 37:15.520
This dog is freaking me out.

37:15.560 --> 37:16.610
Chesterfield.

37:17.770 --> 37:20.900
Oh!
He was staring at me for hours.

37:20.940 --> 37:22.440
I just couldn't let him win.

37:22.490 --> 37:23.240
Brogan?

37:23.280 --> 37:24.360
[Rose]
Yeah. Brogan.

37:24.400 --> 37:25.700
Even though his company
is much smaller,

37:25.740 --> 37:27.240
he was in
on the initial bidding.

37:27.280 --> 37:29.030
So-- Elsa goes down.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.910
Brogan swoops in,
picks up the contract.

37:30.950 --> 37:32.000
[Des]
I couldn't find much on him.

37:32.040 --> 37:33.750
I'm gonna need bit more time.

37:33.790 --> 37:36.290
It's like he didn't exist
before he moved here in 2008.

37:36.330 --> 37:37.630
We need to talk to Brogan.

37:37.670 --> 37:39.920
And if Elsa's
out of the picture,

37:39.960 --> 37:41.840
it's Brogan's site now. Come on.

37:43.380 --> 37:46.090
[announcer on TV] At an
impromptu news conference today,

37:46.130 --> 37:49.140
former mayor Clarke showed
reporters what he says...

37:49.180 --> 37:50.850
B'ys, You gotta be kidding me.

37:50.890 --> 37:53.020
Turn off the TV please.

37:53.060 --> 37:53.810
Sergeant, You're not
gonna like this.

37:54.730 --> 37:56.400
Who did this to me? You ask?

37:57.150 --> 37:58.730
Your local police did.

37:58.770 --> 38:00.440
Sergeant Leslie Bennett
assaulted me in public.

38:01.730 --> 38:04.240
I have witnesses to
corroborate my story.

38:04.280 --> 38:05.610
And before you even ask...

38:05.650 --> 38:07.740
You're damn right. I'm
gonna press charges.

38:07.780 --> 38:09.120
Jake Doyle--

38:09.160 --> 38:11.080
A local Private Eye--
He threatened to kill me.

38:11.120 --> 38:13.830
And they'll be charges
against him too, obviously.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.250
Leslie, this is serious.

38:16.290 --> 38:16.870
Please let me handle this.

38:18.290 --> 38:20.130
I'm gonna make some calls.
Do some damage control.

38:20.170 --> 38:21.290
Do us a favor.

38:21.340 --> 38:23.260
Please. Stay away from Clarke.

38:25.340 --> 38:28.640
[Hood] Leslie. Call your
Rep and your counsel.

38:28.680 --> 38:30.390
Don't go out and make
this any worse.

38:31.350 --> 38:32.810
- What's his address?
- Les...

38:32.850 --> 38:35.230
Clarke's address.
Write it down. Now

38:43.230 --> 38:44.150
Leave it.

38:52.950 --> 38:53.870
[alarm sound]

38:53.910 --> 38:54.790
The alarm.

38:55.500 --> 38:55.580
Cops are on the way.

38:57.250 --> 39:00.670
Good. When they get here, we'll
tell them everything we know.

39:00.710 --> 39:01.750
We should split up.

39:02.290 --> 39:03.300
Be careful.

39:03.340 --> 39:04.210
Yeah.

39:10.300 --> 39:11.180
Brogan!

39:12.720 --> 39:13.970
Look, man, I just--

39:14.010 --> 39:15.020
Arrgh!

39:25.530 --> 39:27.490
Clarke. No!

39:28.650 --> 39:29.530
Arrgh!

39:38.290 --> 39:39.170
[whispering]
Leslie.

39:39.870 --> 39:41.000
[sirens in distance]

39:43.460 --> 39:44.340
[Jake]
Clarke.

39:46.340 --> 39:47.130
Clarke.

39:47.840 --> 39:48.720
[Valerie]
Freeze!

39:49.840 --> 39:50.380
Drop the knife.

39:51.340 --> 39:52.840
[Hood]
Jake. Drop the knife.

39:52.890 --> 39:54.350
Down on the floor now.

40:11.200 --> 40:12.570
Well?

40:12.610 --> 40:14.030
It doesn't look good.

40:14.070 --> 40:15.410
They're gonna keep him here

40:15.450 --> 40:17.790
until they're ready to move
him to Her Majesty's.

40:17.830 --> 40:20.620
The Pen? Jake can't
go back there.

40:20.660 --> 40:22.210
There's too many people inside
who want to hurt him.

40:22.250 --> 40:24.500
It's okay, honey. Leslie will
sort through all of this.

40:24.540 --> 40:26.550
Jake is looking to talk to his
daughter.

40:26.590 --> 40:27.500
Has anybody seen Sloan?

40:27.550 --> 40:28.590
[Tinny]
No.

40:28.630 --> 40:30.220
I've been calling her all day.
Nothing.

40:30.260 --> 40:31.050
Can we see him?

40:31.090 --> 40:32.180
[Walter]
No.

40:32.220 --> 40:33.300
I convinced them to
let him see Sloan.

40:34.090 --> 40:35.510
He's been asking for her.

40:48.860 --> 40:49.990
How are we doing?

40:51.780 --> 40:54.030
I've got it all. You?

40:55.410 --> 40:57.990
Credit cards. Bank accounts.
Corporate accounts.

40:58.580 --> 40:59.080
All transferred.

41:00.040 --> 41:01.250
We're very close to being rich.

41:04.210 --> 41:05.080
Good.

41:09.210 --> 41:10.590
You getting cold feet

41:13.840 --> 41:15.180
These people were good to me.

41:16.090 --> 41:17.810
Wasn't this your plan all along?

41:17.850 --> 41:18.720
No.

41:19.600 --> 41:20.020
Yes.

41:21.180 --> 41:23.020
I mean, I was gonna rip
them off. But...

41:24.140 --> 41:25.310
We don't need to do this.

41:25.350 --> 41:28.320
No. We're doing it.

41:29.440 --> 41:31.230
And next we're gonna
hit Saul's place.

41:31.280 --> 41:32.650
Are you insane?

41:32.690 --> 41:34.650
The Doyle's barely have twenty K
between them.

41:34.700 --> 41:35.820
If we're gonna leave town,

41:35.860 --> 41:37.240
we're gonna need
more than that to live on.

41:38.830 --> 41:39.830
Saul will kill us.

41:40.910 --> 41:43.710
I'm betraying people who
took me in.

41:45.000 --> 41:48.290
We rob Saul. We bail.
And start somewhere new.

41:48.710 --> 41:49.590
Fine.

41:50.380 --> 41:51.260
Whatever.

42:23.410 --> 42:24.500
Hi Leslie.

42:27.500 --> 42:30.250
Now, now, girl.
Easy now.

42:37.720 --> 42:39.470
Shhhh.

42:40.050 --> 42:41.390
Almost there.

42:47.850 --> 42:48.730
Let's go.
