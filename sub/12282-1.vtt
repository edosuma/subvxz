01:19.831 --> 01:23.246
One thing I've learned in the last seven years,

01:23.292 --> 01:28.879
in every game and con there is always
an opponent and there is always a victim.

01:29.924 --> 01:35.594
The trick is to know when you're the latter,
so you can become the former.

01:56.784 --> 01:59.405
How deep did you bury that shareholder, Paul?

02:00.454 --> 02:02.530
Deep.

02:05.334 --> 02:07.623
Are you sure this is a good idea?

02:07.670 --> 02:09.663
He has to pay us something, doesn't he?

02:09.714 --> 02:12.750
But you've got more money
than you could ever spend.

02:12.800 --> 02:15.042
That's all you think about nowadays.

02:15.094 --> 02:17.170
He owes me and he owes you.

02:17.221 --> 02:19.297
Now he has to pay.

02:19.348 --> 02:21.424
It's cause and effect.

03:23.579 --> 03:26.070
Sorry, sir, this table is closed.

03:27.291 --> 03:28.750
Send him up.

03:28.793 --> 03:32.458
I'm not sure that's a good idea, Mr D.
He's got better. I mean, a lot better.

03:32.505 --> 03:33.964
All the tables are closed.

03:38.594 --> 03:40.670
Send him up, Paul.

03:45.601 --> 03:47.226
20.

03:47.270 --> 03:49.346
Hold on.

03:49.397 --> 03:51.520
I think we'll take the stairs, eh, Billy?

03:51.566 --> 03:53.523
You want to walk 20 flights, Jake?

03:53.568 --> 03:54.978
Don't be silly.

03:55.027 --> 03:58.231
I don't like to feel trapped. Never did, never will.

03:58.281 --> 04:02.610
Why should a man
do what he doesn't like to do?

04:03.703 --> 04:07.997
Jake, if you want to take the stairs,
we'll take the stairs...

04:08.040 --> 04:11.291
There's always a choice.
What's wrong with the stairs?

04:14.088 --> 04:15.499
Come on, you'll be all right.

04:33.566 --> 04:36.235
I've got to spend the next two minutes

04:36.277 --> 04:41.272
shaking and sweating like a crack whore
clucking for a fix.

04:42.366 --> 04:48.950
Should have taken the stairs,
cos it's getting very, very tight in here.

05:05.264 --> 05:08.016
I'm afraid it's only two at the table, Mr Green.

05:12.647 --> 05:14.723
Freddy, you're done.

05:19.445 --> 05:21.402
Have a seat, Mr Green.

05:22.907 --> 05:25.480
I hear you've done very well for yourself...

05:26.536 --> 05:28.409
...and against all the odds.

05:28.454 --> 05:32.203
They do say, the harder the battle
the sweeter the victory.

05:33.918 --> 05:37.334
A wise man once told me
there's only one rule in this world,

05:38.422 --> 05:40.830
a small question that drives all success.

05:42.176 --> 05:47.716
The more a man invests in that question,
the more powerful that man will become.

05:48.975 --> 05:51.596
Can you guess what that question is, Mr Green?

05:55.106 --> 05:58.272
What's in it for me?

06:01.028 --> 06:05.073
I've been warned
if I let you sit down at this table I might regret it.

06:06.117 --> 06:09.450
They say you've become
very ambitious in your maturing,

06:09.495 --> 06:12.781
and you now wish to acquire yourself
a business,

06:13.875 --> 06:16.163
a business like my business?

06:16.210 --> 06:18.701
But we both know what you are, don't we, Jake?

06:18.754 --> 06:23.463
You're a man who needs a master.
You're an employee.

06:23.509 --> 06:25.585
So, what's in it for me?

06:26.637 --> 06:30.635
The pleasure of doing an old employee a favour,

06:30.683 --> 06:35.428
by reminding him of the position
nature chose for him.

06:36.522 --> 06:39.013
Rade, how much have you got?

06:40.109 --> 06:41.983
What's that got to do with you?

06:42.028 --> 06:44.519
Toss you for it.

06:46.199 --> 06:48.606
He's got you there, Rade.

06:51.412 --> 06:54.448
It's not worth a heart attack. Get on with it.

06:57.668 --> 07:00.242
I'll toss you for a tenth.

07:00.296 --> 07:04.128
You're a risk-taker of the highest calibre,
ain't you, Rade?

07:06.135 --> 07:08.211
I'll take red.

07:14.685 --> 07:20.024
Very impressive, Mr Green.
You've honed those talents most skilfully.

07:20.066 --> 07:22.771
Pay the man his money, Billy.

07:22.818 --> 07:24.728
Should have bet the whole lot, Rade.

07:26.030 --> 07:28.438
You have to teach me that trick sometime.

07:32.495 --> 07:34.404
You're on.

07:36.832 --> 07:39.703
I'll toss you for everything under your chin.

07:43.214 --> 07:45.787
There isn't a problem is there, Mr D?

07:47.927 --> 07:51.426
You've got a big mouth on a small head,
sunshine.

07:53.558 --> 07:55.431
Be my guest.

07:56.477 --> 07:58.304
I'll take purple.

07:58.354 --> 08:00.430
You're on.

08:03.401 --> 08:05.440
It's a lovely colour, purple,

08:05.486 --> 08:10.647
discretely sandwiched within
the colour spectrum between blue and white.

08:11.242 --> 08:13.531
Always a royal winner.

08:21.002 --> 08:23.457
Billy, do the honours.

08:24.589 --> 08:27.162
Don't you fucking move.

08:28.259 --> 08:32.006
Don't let your mouth put you in more trouble
than your body could handle.

08:32.054 --> 08:35.803
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll exercise a bit of charity.

08:35.850 --> 08:38.139
Double or quits?

08:46.319 --> 08:48.358
You're on.

08:50.239 --> 08:51.437
Come on.

08:53.159 --> 08:57.655
Mr Green, Mr Macha would appreciate it
if you came back to the table.

09:00.249 --> 09:02.325
I haven't finished with him yet.

09:05.296 --> 09:07.372
Now would be a good time.

09:08.841 --> 09:11.213
I think it's time to fly, don't you, Jake?

09:16.849 --> 09:18.925
- Excuse me.
- We're coming through here.

09:18.976 --> 09:22.641
Relax. You're in trouble, Mr Green.
We could help.

09:23.731 --> 09:25.807
Thank you.

09:29.654 --> 09:32.524
I take the stairs.

10:47.440 --> 10:49.516
He got lucky, Mr D, that's all.

10:49.567 --> 10:51.643
Fuck luck, the man's a danger.

10:51.694 --> 10:55.145
Since he's been out, he's made a fortune, Mr D.
He's fat and comfortable.

10:55.198 --> 10:58.732
He's got what he wanted.
I'm sure we won't be hearing from him again.

10:58.784 --> 11:02.200
He ate seven years, Paul.
Seven years doesn't taste nice.

11:02.246 --> 11:05.366
Not to mention the accident
with his brother's wife.

11:08.753 --> 11:12.833
And what the fuck does
"I haven't finished with him yet" mean?

11:18.346 --> 11:20.422
Get rid of him.

11:21.474 --> 11:23.550
And I don't want any mistakes.

11:23.601 --> 11:27.136
No crackheads with sharp sticks
acting like silly fucking gangsters.

11:27.188 --> 11:31.565
You take Sorter and Slim Biggins.
You do it quickly, you do it quietly.

11:31.984 --> 11:34.558
We don't know what caused the blackout.

11:34.612 --> 11:39.488
But we've run some blood tests
and we'll have the results within a few hours.

11:40.535 --> 11:43.785
It's a miracle
you didn't sustain any damage from your fall.

11:43.829 --> 11:45.288
Can I go now?

11:45.331 --> 11:47.489
Once you've put your clothes back on.

11:47.542 --> 11:49.700
We'll call you back with the results.

11:50.753 --> 11:53.125
All right, look, I'll take your man back.

11:54.215 --> 11:56.291
Billy. You go home.

11:56.342 --> 11:58.418
It's late.

12:00.680 --> 12:02.756
Go easy now, yeah?

12:44.390 --> 12:46.715
Joe.

12:46.767 --> 12:47.549
Joe.

12:47.602 --> 12:49.890
Jake. Move.
- Joe.

12:49.937 --> 12:51.645
Move. Get the hell out of here.

13:00.156 --> 13:02.030
Al, drive the fucking car.

13:03.451 --> 13:04.696
Sit down and hold on.

13:14.045 --> 13:15.455
Get in the car.

13:17.757 --> 13:20.711
If I wanted you dead,
I would have shot you already.

13:26.182 --> 13:27.557
Sit back and be quiet.

13:40.571 --> 13:42.647
What?

13:42.698 --> 13:44.572
He missed?

13:46.202 --> 13:48.871
Sorter never fucking misses.

13:48.913 --> 13:51.700
I don't know what happened.

13:51.749 --> 13:54.038
Something went wrong.

13:54.085 --> 13:56.161
I had him in my sights...

13:56.212 --> 13:57.789
three times.

13:59.966 --> 14:02.291
You never miss, let alone three times.

14:03.386 --> 14:05.758
Somebody told him we was coming.

14:09.350 --> 14:11.722
Something is very wrong here.

14:11.769 --> 14:13.975
Yeah, something's fucking wrong all right.

14:14.856 --> 14:16.932
Don't make me angry, Slim.

14:18.067 --> 14:22.444
I might have missed him,
but I ain't going to miss you, not at this range.

14:25.366 --> 14:27.442
Maybe it's better you just drive.

14:32.081 --> 14:35.450
Doreen, Mr Green. Mr Green, Doreen.

14:35.501 --> 14:37.494
Good morning, Mr Green.

14:40.631 --> 14:43.917
Avi, Mr Green.

14:43.968 --> 14:47.135
Mr Green, Avi.

14:47.180 --> 14:49.137
Sit down.

14:56.230 --> 14:58.306
I gather you're quite the player?

15:00.109 --> 15:04.237
I'm a bit of an enthusiast myself.
I thought maybe we could have a few games.

15:04.280 --> 15:07.696
I think you should tell me what is going on,
don't you?

15:10.036 --> 15:12.823
We have your medical results from the hospital.

15:12.872 --> 15:15.742
It's not important how we got them.

15:15.791 --> 15:20.003
What is important, however,
is what it has to say.

15:24.217 --> 15:27.917
You will die within three days
from a very unpleasant ailment

15:27.970 --> 15:30.378
that contaminates your blood and organs.

15:37.772 --> 15:41.604
Thanks, fellas.
I'll get back to you on this one, yeah?

15:43.444 --> 15:45.318
Mr Green.

15:46.405 --> 15:49.442
30 seconds, and you can be on your way.

15:49.492 --> 15:52.493
The longer you listen, the sweeter the pitch.

15:52.537 --> 15:54.446
30 seconds?

16:06.008 --> 16:10.088
We've already saved your life once.
The next time will not be for free.

16:11.389 --> 16:14.010
We shall assist you under two conditions.

16:14.058 --> 16:16.727
These conditions are not negotiable.

16:16.769 --> 16:19.687
Oh, I'm being grafted.

16:19.730 --> 16:21.141
Condition one.

16:23.860 --> 16:25.936
We will bleed you dry.

16:25.987 --> 16:29.569
You have to put on a better shirt
before you bleed me dry, my friend.

16:29.615 --> 16:33.364
You will give us every penny you have got.

16:33.411 --> 16:35.783
This is a con.

16:35.830 --> 16:39.413
It's only natural that you think that
you are somehow being conned,

16:39.458 --> 16:43.242
but think a little harder,
and you will realise that this is not a trick.

16:43.296 --> 16:46.213
Now, condition two.

16:47.300 --> 16:51.297
You will do as we tell you without argument.

16:51.345 --> 16:56.932
This includes
answering any questions that are asked.

16:56.976 --> 17:02.646
You don't have a lot of time,
and, in reality, you don't have a choice.

17:04.525 --> 17:08.653
Now, the most sensible thing to do
would be to get a second opinion.

17:09.739 --> 17:11.815
Macha has unleashed his legions.

17:11.866 --> 17:15.234
We can protect you from the dangers you face.
That is our deal.

17:18.372 --> 17:22.204
You have three hours to decide.
After that, you will be beyond our help.

17:22.251 --> 17:25.252
Think I'm going to part with
my hard-earned cash

17:25.296 --> 17:27.621
for a set of home-made hospital results?

17:27.673 --> 17:29.749
I don't think so.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.758
Not today.

17:45.608 --> 17:49.440
I don't have good news, I'm afraid, Mr Green.

17:49.487 --> 17:53.567
They've thought this one through all right.
Oh, they're smart.

17:53.616 --> 17:56.985
Smart as a pair of a little boy's shoes.

17:58.079 --> 18:00.155
She has to be in on it.

18:00.206 --> 18:02.282
That's how they got the results.

18:02.333 --> 18:05.334
Got to find someone they couldn't have got to.

18:06.420 --> 18:08.793
Well, Jake...

18:15.012 --> 18:17.088
I'm sorry, there's...

18:17.139 --> 18:19.216
there's no easy way to tell you this.

18:19.267 --> 18:22.849
You have a rare blood disease.

18:27.316 --> 18:29.392
How did they get to him?

18:30.444 --> 18:32.318
He's in on it.

18:33.197 --> 18:34.739
After a few days I think...

18:35.867 --> 18:38.867
- How much did they pay you?
- What? Who?

18:38.911 --> 18:39.990
How much?

18:40.037 --> 18:42.872
What are you talking about?
I have no idea what you mean.

18:42.915 --> 18:45.786
You've got five seconds. Five...

18:45.835 --> 18:48.373
I have no idea what you're talking about.

18:48.421 --> 18:50.248
- Four...
- Wh...? I...

18:50.298 --> 18:52.705
- Three... Two...
- I don't know what you mean.

18:52.758 --> 18:54.466
God. No, no.

18:55.553 --> 18:59.385
When you're winning,
who thinks about losing?

18:59.432 --> 19:03.382
But when you're faced with what I'm looking at,

19:03.436 --> 19:07.220
a new and cold reality dawns.

19:08.608 --> 19:12.308
A fact we like to ignore.

19:12.361 --> 19:15.031
You can not win.

19:15.072 --> 19:18.987
The only prize they guarantee
when you play this game

19:19.035 --> 19:21.111
is that you will lose.

19:23.206 --> 19:25.910
It's only a question of when.

19:28.002 --> 19:31.371
I made a mistake.

19:31.422 --> 19:36.417
You never miss,
so why now and why three times?

19:39.639 --> 19:41.927
I had a bad feeling.

19:44.936 --> 19:47.059
"Feeling?"

19:48.356 --> 19:52.484
I'm not sure if I paid you to have feelings,
now, did I, Sorter?

19:54.946 --> 19:57.982
I paid you
because you're the best in the business.

19:58.032 --> 20:02.824
Why would you let feelings
confuse that relationship?

20:03.913 --> 20:05.906
Listen to me.

20:06.999 --> 20:10.249
Urgency has become something of an issue.

20:10.294 --> 20:13.829
So if you could restrain those feelings

20:13.881 --> 20:20.002
until you've completed the mission,
I would be most grateful.

20:21.722 --> 20:23.964
Do you think you could do that for me?

20:24.016 --> 20:25.974
Sure.

20:26.018 --> 20:28.094
I'd appreciate it.

20:44.620 --> 20:49.994
If there is one thing I have learnt
about experts, they're experts on fuck all.

20:51.085 --> 20:56.080
If there's a rule, you can bend it.
If there's a law, it can be broken.

20:57.133 --> 21:05.223
From now on, I am breaking all the rules,
because desperate men do desperate deeds.

21:06.642 --> 21:09.347
Cash just seems to remain king, doesn't it?

21:10.855 --> 21:13.560
New bills. Not too many of them in this town.

21:23.826 --> 21:25.700
I love a new bill.

21:25.745 --> 21:29.196
Represents so much hope.
Look how clean and stiff it is.

21:31.250 --> 21:33.492
It even smells proud.

21:33.544 --> 21:38.040
Your work starts now. You'll be driving.

21:41.344 --> 21:48.640
We are, and I apologise for the
unnecessarily dramatic moniker, loan sharks.

21:48.684 --> 21:53.596
People hate and fear us,
just like you will learn to hate and fear us.

21:53.648 --> 21:55.854
We know how much you love a dollar bill,

21:55.900 --> 22:00.194
and it won't be easy watching them
fall through your hands,

22:00.238 --> 22:03.357
because it will be your money
that we will be loaning.

22:13.834 --> 22:15.911
Don't say a word.

22:17.004 --> 22:20.041
Just hold the bag
and if we nod, leave it on the table.

22:21.175 --> 22:23.251
There's nothing left.

22:24.470 --> 22:28.550
That's a very sad story, Mr Horowitz.
My sympathies are with you and your colleague.

22:28.599 --> 22:33.012
Maybe I am being conned,
maybe I am being fooled.

22:33.062 --> 22:37.439
Excuse us for having to know
the reason for your loan,

22:37.483 --> 22:40.318
but we have to assess our clients very carefully.

22:40.361 --> 22:45.237
They say the sentence has been passed,
the certificate signed, so what's the point?

22:45.283 --> 22:48.616
The point is, this is the only option.

22:53.583 --> 22:57.830
If you snap those fingers at me again,
I'll fucking break 'em.

23:01.257 --> 23:03.380
You know our rates, right?

23:05.052 --> 23:06.630
And our policies?

23:08.764 --> 23:11.884
No offence, gentlemen,
but you have a reputation.

23:15.062 --> 23:17.684
I wouldn't be speaking to you if I had a choice.

23:23.196 --> 23:28.700
It's a strange thing,
but I still don't like to give it away.

23:31.579 --> 23:35.956
I know I can't take it with me, so why the pain?

23:37.001 --> 23:39.622
Why the fuck does it still hurt?

23:48.679 --> 23:53.009
And greasing the sheaths of these two pricks
isn't making it any easier.

24:06.197 --> 24:08.439
We need to know your history with Macha.

24:09.534 --> 24:11.740
How much of it?

24:11.786 --> 24:14.324
All of it.

24:20.169 --> 24:23.870
Macha had these three clowns working for him
called the three Eddies.

24:23.923 --> 24:26.046
Flash, loud, proud and stupid.

24:26.092 --> 24:30.303
They were looking after these shitty little games
going on all over the city.

24:30.346 --> 24:34.474
They were wild and dangerous,
but if you won they paid well.

24:34.517 --> 24:38.182
Macha had lost his card man
just before a big game.

24:38.229 --> 24:42.938
Anyway they knew I could play,
so they wanted me to take his place.

24:42.984 --> 24:46.269
Like any man who was thinking, I refused.

24:46.320 --> 24:49.238
So they started to lean on
my brother and his family.

24:49.282 --> 24:51.737
He'd just had a little girl at the time and...

24:52.785 --> 24:55.110
...the whole situation was getting messy.

24:55.162 --> 24:58.448
# How many legs has daddy long-legs got?

24:58.499 --> 25:02.164
So, for the sake of keeping the peace,
I rolled over and agreed to play.

25:02.211 --> 25:04.334
I won, and I was done.

25:04.380 --> 25:06.456
That's very good, Mr Green,

25:06.507 --> 25:11.050
but tell me, does your mum...
from a donkey?

25:12.847 --> 25:16.097
Then some cowboy starts mouthing off.

25:16.142 --> 25:18.134
I wasn't having any of that shit.

25:18.186 --> 25:20.178
I'm not having any of that shit.

25:22.356 --> 25:24.432
I've got a funny one for you too, George.

25:24.483 --> 25:28.018
Very funny, George.
This one will make you laugh.

25:28.821 --> 25:34.859
Next thing you know, it's a gunfight,
people get hurt and money disappears.

25:34.911 --> 25:38.778
Two weeks later, someone drops my name
and I'm being questioned.

25:38.831 --> 25:43.458
The Eddies thought I might talk,
so they threatened my brother's daughter.

25:43.502 --> 25:47.286
The mother reacted badly, like they do
when their little ones are in danger.

25:47.340 --> 25:50.625
They got into a fight
and she took an angry stray bullet.

25:50.676 --> 25:54.591
My brother lost his wife
and his daughter lost her mother.

25:55.890 --> 25:57.847
I lost my sense of humour and seven years

25:57.892 --> 26:01.592
because I wouldn't tell the authorities
that Macha had organised the games.

26:04.440 --> 26:07.560
Sometime after that,
the Eddies upset Macha in some way,

26:07.610 --> 26:12.817
so he had them used as aggregate and mixed
into some concrete on one of his buildings.

26:14.784 --> 26:17.950
Macha had to pay something, didn't he?

26:19.455 --> 26:24.960
And I know nothing hurts more than humiliation
and a little money loss.

26:31.592 --> 26:33.668
I employ hundreds of people.

26:33.719 --> 26:35.795
They have to be paid tomorrow.

26:36.889 --> 26:39.380
We need three more days.

26:39.433 --> 26:41.225
Try to understand.

26:46.190 --> 26:48.266
What did I sign up for?

26:48.317 --> 26:54.438
Don't try to make sense out of it, not now,
cos it doesn't make sense.

26:55.950 --> 26:59.568
I just know if you start a job then finish it.

26:59.620 --> 27:00.818
I promise.

27:00.872 --> 27:02.948
Yes, you will.

27:02.999 --> 27:05.240
Goddamn right.

27:09.714 --> 27:12.999
Their idea of discretion is to choose a motel

27:13.050 --> 27:15.921
whose only clients are blood,
come and afro sheen.

27:15.970 --> 27:18.046
Make yourself at home.

27:18.097 --> 27:20.173
You'll be hearing from us.

27:28.232 --> 27:29.810
We can't see Gold.

27:29.859 --> 27:32.528
What are you talking about?
I've been here for an hour.

27:32.570 --> 27:34.812
I'm not the one
who asked for a fucking meeting.

27:34.864 --> 27:38.529
Apparently, no-one sees Gold.
We've got one of his representatives, Walker.

27:38.576 --> 27:41.411
- Lilly Walker?
- That's right.

28:06.854 --> 28:09.226
Mr Macha, I don't think we've met.

28:09.273 --> 28:11.349
I'm Miss Walker.

28:11.400 --> 28:13.773
I work for Mr Gold. Do you mind if we walk?

28:15.947 --> 28:19.398
I understand you have been commissioned
to do some work for us?

28:19.450 --> 28:22.570
I thought it might be a good idea
if we had a little chat

28:22.620 --> 28:27.198
to make sure you understand the gravity
of the endeavour you have undertaken.

28:27.250 --> 28:29.741
Yeah, I do, I understand.

28:29.794 --> 28:33.874
Everything's set. The date hasn't changed,
you'll get the powder by Friday.

28:33.923 --> 28:38.834
Good. Mr Gold has put his faith in you,
and he has people to please.

28:38.886 --> 28:41.673
We've heard
you might be having some problems?

28:41.722 --> 28:43.798
No, no.

28:43.850 --> 28:46.341
We don't like publicity, Mr Macha.

28:46.394 --> 28:50.012
No, neither do I.
I won't let you down, I won't let Mr Gold down.

29:18.176 --> 29:20.631
So, we're clear?

29:22.972 --> 29:25.380
Mr Gold doesn't give more time

29:25.433 --> 29:28.350
or second chances.

29:28.394 --> 29:35.441
As you can appreciate, there is no shortage
of people who wish to do business with Mr Gold.

29:35.484 --> 29:37.062
Good day.

30:23.950 --> 30:25.741
Here's your money.

30:25.785 --> 30:27.576
What now?

30:27.620 --> 30:29.613
Have a seat.

30:38.130 --> 30:41.749
We need to know how much time you did,
and who you did it with.

30:41.801 --> 30:43.461
Why?

30:43.511 --> 30:45.254
"Why?"

30:45.304 --> 30:47.131
The deal is we ask the questions.

30:55.147 --> 30:57.224
I had two choices inside,

30:57.275 --> 31:00.940
14 years' normal time or seven years' solitary.

31:03.531 --> 31:05.274
I chose the solitary.

31:14.125 --> 31:17.079
I spent 20 hours a day locked up
in between two salty convicts

31:17.128 --> 31:20.746
who had been down there for more years
than they cared to remember.

31:20.798 --> 31:24.084
One was a chess master,
the other a master conman.

31:24.135 --> 31:26.211
They had never seen or spoken to each other,

31:26.262 --> 31:30.010
but they might as well have been married,
they knew so much about one another.

31:30.057 --> 31:31.600
Once a day, the library on wheels

31:31.642 --> 31:34.560
would be pushed around
by a pair of axe-murdering twins,

31:34.604 --> 31:36.976
that had pushed the trolley for 22 years.

31:40.651 --> 31:44.103
My neighbours used to write down chess moves
and concepts of the con

31:44.155 --> 31:47.405
in the back pages of books
based on subjects like...

31:48.492 --> 31:55.373
Theoretical Astrophysics Part Four,
The Mathematics Of Quantum Mechanics.

31:55.416 --> 31:57.705
They just used them for the con.

31:57.752 --> 32:02.212
I used to intercept the books, because
I was sandwiched in between their cells.

32:02.256 --> 32:07.002
It's a dangerous combination, chess and cons.

32:07.053 --> 32:10.552
These boys were locked up on their own
for ten years with no distractions.

32:10.598 --> 32:14.761
Nothing to do but think about
how to steal one another's pieces.

32:16.812 --> 32:19.019
Yeah, they thought.

32:19.732 --> 32:21.274
They really thought.

32:21.317 --> 32:25.101
I was under the impression that I was
the clever bastard before I went in.

32:25.154 --> 32:29.946
But these boys were a completely different
class. Head tricksters of the premier division.

32:29.992 --> 32:34.156
Their sole ambition was to create
the ultimate con and win the ultimate game,

32:34.205 --> 32:37.159
always thinking quicker, always thinking bigger.

32:37.208 --> 32:41.834
Gradually, they thought
they'd found a formula to the con. Check.

32:41.879 --> 32:45.794
A formula to win the ultimate win, the formula.

32:45.841 --> 32:47.881
I couldn't understand the depth of it,

32:47.927 --> 32:51.177
but they were confident it was real
and I believed them.

32:52.974 --> 32:55.809
After all, they'd been right on everything else,

32:55.852 --> 32:59.221
so now they felt they'd had their moment

32:59.272 --> 33:02.723
and it was time for them
to leave the confines of their cell.

33:02.775 --> 33:05.895
The concrete and steel wasn't even mentioned.

33:05.945 --> 33:09.195
I didn't even doubt them.
They got whatever they wanted anyway.

33:09.240 --> 33:13.107
I could smell their food
through 12 inches of concrete.

33:13.160 --> 33:15.616
Bastards knew it used to drive me mad.

33:15.663 --> 33:17.905
You bastards.

33:17.957 --> 33:22.334
We were all going to go together,
they swore to me. "You're coming with us, Jake."

33:22.378 --> 33:26.127
And I trusted them.
Never for a second did I doubt them.

33:26.173 --> 33:28.665
Next day, they were gone without a trace.

33:28.718 --> 33:31.422
For the next week,
the authorities tore the place apart.

33:31.470 --> 33:36.678
Couldn't find evidence of their existence,
let alone their exit. They just evaporated.

33:37.768 --> 33:39.393
Check.

33:40.479 --> 33:42.686
Two years later, I was out.

33:43.774 --> 33:46.063
But those two knew everything about me.

33:47.403 --> 33:54.236
Everything. All my dirty little secrets,
how much money I had, where I kept it.

33:54.285 --> 33:56.527
The hustling bastards cleaned me out.

33:56.579 --> 34:00.529
They didn't leave so much
as a pair of socks, only a note.

34:00.583 --> 34:04.830
Rule one: You can only get smarter
by playing a smarter opponent.

34:08.466 --> 34:11.004
But I had their formula and

34:11.052 --> 34:13.543
it worked.

34:13.596 --> 34:15.672
It really worked.

34:17.016 --> 34:19.174
Not doing you much good now, is it?

34:23.481 --> 34:25.556
Checkmate.

34:25.608 --> 34:29.024
He needs to get moving.
Give him the addresses.

34:47.295 --> 34:49.289
Why are they dragging this on?

34:50.382 --> 34:53.752
They could just clean me out in one hit.

34:53.803 --> 34:55.795
They want me to suffer.

34:57.348 --> 35:02.140
These twisted bastards are making me pay.
Pay for my own pain.

35:03.229 --> 35:07.274
Hands down, that's the most radical concept
I have ever heard of...

35:08.359 --> 35:11.028
...and a part of me dies every time I think about it.

35:12.321 --> 35:18.988
I told myself if this is my last round,
they'll have to tear me out, piece by piece,

35:20.079 --> 35:22.700
but this I can't take.

35:22.748 --> 35:24.622
They've found a weakness.

35:25.710 --> 35:28.794
Caught me fair and square, cross-haired,

35:28.838 --> 35:33.666
blind-folded, one foot in the grave
and two hands on the coffin.

35:33.718 --> 35:39.637
I'm cooked, well done,
stick a fork in me and see if I bleed.

35:42.226 --> 35:45.726
- Checkmate.
- You're quite good at this game, Mr Green.

35:47.440 --> 35:51.224
I am stuck in a trance...

35:52.403 --> 35:56.531
...somewhere between hell and a hard place...

35:57.617 --> 36:00.190
...in a gear that doesn't exist,

36:01.245 --> 36:03.321
and all I want now...

36:04.415 --> 36:06.491
...is a little peace.

36:10.880 --> 36:12.956
Where are you?

36:13.007 --> 36:15.580
- At the old lady's house.
- Does she have it?

36:15.635 --> 36:18.968
Of course she doesn't have it.
She's barely got a heartbeat.

36:19.013 --> 36:21.884
How the hell is this woman
going to get that kind of money?

36:21.933 --> 36:24.471
That's what she owes. Any furniture?

36:25.561 --> 36:27.388
No.

36:28.481 --> 36:30.972
Take the dog.

36:31.025 --> 36:33.598
I am not taking the dog.

36:33.653 --> 36:36.440
- Then take the TV.
- The TV don't work.

36:36.489 --> 36:38.113
Then get your ass over here.

36:38.157 --> 36:40.150
How do you sleep at night?

36:41.244 --> 36:43.320
How are we doing?

36:43.371 --> 36:45.114
Ask the man.

36:47.250 --> 36:49.326
No thanks, darling.

36:59.887 --> 37:02.046
Time's up, lets go.

37:12.191 --> 37:14.267
Mr Green, you took your time.

37:16.362 --> 37:18.983
- Did you get anything from the old lady?
- No.

37:19.031 --> 37:21.107
Did you get anything from Horowitz?

37:21.158 --> 37:23.235
- No.
- Why not?

37:23.286 --> 37:25.362
Because he didn't have it.

37:25.413 --> 37:28.330
Listen, pal, either he pays or you pay.

37:28.374 --> 37:30.450
I pay anyway.

37:30.501 --> 37:32.577
Don't be a smartass.

37:34.088 --> 37:38.086
Look, man,
we are not sending you out to polish door knobs.

37:38.134 --> 37:40.210
You've got to get with it, man.

37:42.430 --> 37:44.506
Doreen, take his car.

37:44.557 --> 37:47.095
Come with us.

37:47.143 --> 37:49.219
What is this?

37:49.270 --> 37:51.346
Where was security?

37:51.397 --> 37:53.686
They gassed them. We found them tied up.

37:57.653 --> 38:00.025
Hold tight, Mr Green.

38:04.493 --> 38:09.535
It was a 12-ton Hermann and Ziegler safe, Mr D.
It was impossible to break into.

38:09.582 --> 38:11.325
Time's up, let's go.

38:11.375 --> 38:15.373
Obviously, it wasn't fucking impossible
to move, was it, Paul?

38:18.799 --> 38:20.875
What did anyone take it for?

38:20.927 --> 38:23.548
We don't even use that safe, do we, Paul?

38:27.850 --> 38:29.890
Checkmate.

38:32.855 --> 38:34.647
How in the hell did you do that?

38:37.818 --> 38:39.895
Not usually, no.

38:41.113 --> 38:43.818
Sam Gold's powder was in there.
It came in yesterday.

38:47.453 --> 38:50.573
No, Paul, you're wrong.

38:54.377 --> 38:56.950
Try again.

39:02.176 --> 39:04.252
You stupid motherfucker.

39:09.892 --> 39:12.099
That should rattle him.

39:12.144 --> 39:14.718
What the fuck was it doing
on one of our properties?

39:14.772 --> 39:17.144
Why don't you just fucking rape me, Paul?

39:18.568 --> 39:20.644
Pull the troops together.

39:20.695 --> 39:23.316
Break some bones, hurt some people, results.

39:23.364 --> 39:25.440
- You hear me?
- I'll take care of it.

39:25.491 --> 39:28.528
You're damn straight
you're going to fucking take care of it.

39:28.578 --> 39:31.614
The word "excuse" does not exist
in Sam Gold's lexicon.

39:31.664 --> 39:35.080
We are the walking dead
until you fucking remedy this situation.

39:35.126 --> 39:37.415
- Do you understand?
- I'll take care of it.

39:37.461 --> 39:41.411
I said, do you understand?

39:41.465 --> 39:43.541
- Yes.
- You'd better.

39:44.635 --> 39:46.842
In the meantime, get some more powder.

39:46.888 --> 39:50.636
I don't care where it comes from
or how much it costs, just get it.

39:50.683 --> 39:54.515
There's only one man who can get us
that amount on such short notice.

39:54.562 --> 39:56.436
Who?

39:56.480 --> 39:58.438
Lord John.

40:05.615 --> 40:08.651
No way. I'm not nourishing the competition.

40:09.911 --> 40:12.199
That's twice the market price.

40:27.386 --> 40:30.174
Sorry, we can't help, Mr Paul.

40:30.223 --> 40:32.299
Tony'll show you the way out.

40:35.728 --> 40:38.848
All right. Hold on, hold on.

40:40.316 --> 40:42.439
I am prepared to talk.

41:04.590 --> 41:06.879
What do you want to talk about?

41:10.805 --> 41:12.881
OK, get it.

41:12.932 --> 41:15.008
What?

41:16.102 --> 41:18.178
Am I having dÐ¹jÐ°-vu, Paul?

41:18.229 --> 41:20.305
Didn't I just say "get it"?

41:24.527 --> 41:27.563
This is Sam Gold
I have found myself chained to.

41:27.613 --> 41:29.689
Mr Black Magic.

41:29.740 --> 41:31.816
Mr "l-run-this-game" Gold.

41:31.868 --> 41:35.817
Not some plastic gangster
with a pocketknife for backup.

41:35.872 --> 41:40.948
Gold doesn't give second chances, Paul.
I want in and I want rewards.

41:42.712 --> 41:44.788
Got it?

41:53.097 --> 41:55.006
Paul,

41:55.057 --> 42:00.811
when you make the deal, keep both eyes
on that untrustworthy, greedy motherfucker.

42:59.205 --> 43:03.155
If anyone asks, you don't speak the language.

43:11.592 --> 43:13.300
After you, Mr Green.

43:13.344 --> 43:15.467
I'm taking the stairs.

43:15.513 --> 43:17.137
What's the problem, Mr Green?

43:17.181 --> 43:20.965
- I don't like elevators.
- What are you scared of?

43:21.018 --> 43:24.185
Are you fucking deaf?
I said I just don't like them.

43:24.230 --> 43:26.519
Tough, because you're getting in.

43:37.743 --> 43:38.906
Everything?

43:42.999 --> 43:46.118
If he wants a fucking war,
I'm going to give him a fucking war.

43:46.168 --> 43:49.869
I don't think it was Lord John, Mr D.
He knows you'd come looking for him.

43:49.922 --> 43:53.671
He's not far from wrong. Because
that is exactly what I'm going to fucking do.

43:58.556 --> 44:00.548
I'll take the stairs.

44:01.893 --> 44:05.558
Before we do anything, Mr D,
we have to get Sam Gold his powder.

44:05.605 --> 44:08.143
- Don't pull the trigger...
- Shut your fucking mouth.

44:08.191 --> 44:09.982
- I'll get out.
- You ain't going nowhere.

44:13.487 --> 44:15.397
I said you're staying right here.

44:15.448 --> 44:19.576
Get rid of the Lord...
there will be consequences.

44:21.704 --> 44:24.160
Do I look like I'm afraid of the consequences?

44:26.584 --> 44:29.253
- I'm taking the stairs.
- You ain't going nowhere.

44:29.295 --> 44:30.837
You motherfucking listen.

44:30.880 --> 44:34.213
Look at me. You think I'm afraid
of the fucking consequences?

44:34.258 --> 44:36.002
- Take the stairs.
- You listen to me.

44:38.346 --> 44:42.011
You open your mouth one more fucking time,
I'll blow your fucking head off.

44:42.058 --> 44:43.885
Fuck him.

44:43.935 --> 44:45.345
Fuck the consequences.

44:48.022 --> 44:50.098
Fuck them all.

44:50.149 --> 44:52.106
- Do I look like I'm afraid?
- No.

44:52.151 --> 44:54.227
Do you understand me? Do you?

45:02.870 --> 45:04.910
Lou, what's going on?

45:04.956 --> 45:06.284
We're here.

45:08.417 --> 45:09.449
How many?

45:10.586 --> 45:12.294
We're doing a deal in the next room.

45:16.092 --> 45:17.420
When do you make the trade?

45:18.970 --> 45:21.009
- Ten minutes.
- Ten minutes?

45:22.139 --> 45:25.555
- Don't trust those yellow dogs.
- I don't trust anyone.

46:34.503 --> 46:36.377
Lou?

46:36.422 --> 46:38.794
Talk to me, you motherfucker.

46:38.841 --> 46:40.881
Or I'll kill you myself.

46:53.231 --> 46:57.976
The consequences can kiss my black ass.

48:28.701 --> 48:30.859
This has become a large problem, Avi.

48:31.913 --> 48:34.949
There's no such thing as problems, Mr Green,

48:34.999 --> 48:37.870
only situations.

49:01.567 --> 49:03.441
Wake up, Mr Green.

49:08.950 --> 49:11.026
Checkmate.

49:13.996 --> 49:16.072
How?

49:16.123 --> 49:18.199
How what?

49:18.251 --> 49:20.623
We've kept you alive, now you can tell me.

49:20.670 --> 49:22.627
How do you keep winning?

49:22.672 --> 49:24.748
It's very simple.

49:24.799 --> 49:28.417
You do all the hard work, I just help you along.

49:31.889 --> 49:34.380
The art is for me to feed pieces to you

49:34.433 --> 49:40.020
and make you believe you took those pieces,
because you are smarter and I am dumber.

49:40.064 --> 49:45.604
In every game and con there is always
an opponent and there is always a victim.

49:45.653 --> 49:48.570
The more control the victim thinks he has,

49:49.657 --> 49:51.650
the less control he actually has.

49:51.701 --> 49:53.777
Gradually he will hang himself.

49:53.828 --> 49:56.663
I, as the opponent, just help him along.

49:58.708 --> 50:00.665
Is that the treasured formula?

50:00.710 --> 50:03.995
The formula has infinite depth
in its efficacy and application,

50:04.046 --> 50:07.914
but it is staggeringly simple
and completely consistent.

50:07.967 --> 50:13.388
Rule one of any game or con: You can only
get smarter by playing a smarter opponent.

50:13.431 --> 50:14.806
Rule number two.

50:14.849 --> 50:19.594
The more sophisticated the game,
the more sophisticated the opponent.

50:20.688 --> 50:23.013
If the opponent is very good,

50:23.065 --> 50:26.766
he will place his victim
inside an environment he can control.

50:26.819 --> 50:29.571
The bigger the environment,
the easier the control.

50:29.614 --> 50:34.489
Toss the dog a bone, find their weakness,

50:34.535 --> 50:37.572
and give them just a little
of what they think they want.

50:40.499 --> 50:41.780
Check.

50:41.834 --> 50:44.669
So the opponent simply distracts their victim

50:44.712 --> 50:47.962
by getting them consumed
with their own consumption.

50:52.345 --> 50:53.969
Check.

50:55.056 --> 50:57.677
The word "snake" springs to mind.

50:57.725 --> 51:01.675
Don't knock it.
You only get smarter by playing a snake.

51:03.231 --> 51:07.857
The bigger the trick and older the trick,
the easier it is to pull.

51:07.902 --> 51:10.819
Based on two principles.

51:10.863 --> 51:14.232
They think it can't be that old
and they think it can't be that big,

51:14.283 --> 51:16.240
for so many people to have fallen for it.

51:19.413 --> 51:23.245
Eventually,
when the opponent is challenged or questioned,

51:23.292 --> 51:28.797
it means the victim's investment
and thus his intelligence is questioned.

51:29.882 --> 51:31.958
No-one can accept that,

51:32.009 --> 51:34.085
not even to themselves.

51:38.224 --> 51:40.300
Checkmate.

51:41.394 --> 51:43.932
I ain't playing you again.

51:43.980 --> 51:48.108
You'll always find a good opponent
in the very last place you would ever look.

51:48.150 --> 51:52.444
You've got more tricks than a clown's pocket,
don't you, Mr Green?

52:06.002 --> 52:07.875
Everything all right?

52:18.472 --> 52:19.931
Can they hear you?

52:19.974 --> 52:22.132
Two minutes.

52:24.353 --> 52:26.429
You're OK.

52:26.480 --> 52:28.556
Get out, Jake, as soon as you can.

52:28.608 --> 52:31.277
I had to dig very deep
to find someone who'd talk.

52:31.319 --> 52:33.395
They're the last resort.

52:33.446 --> 52:39.733
They're the last resort. When no other
loan sharks will lend them, your boys move in.

52:40.828 --> 52:43.829
They stepped on Gold's toes
and he wouldn't touch 'em.

52:43.873 --> 52:45.415
Gold?

52:45.458 --> 52:48.957
Yes, the Gold, Sam Gold.

52:49.003 --> 52:51.411
Mr Clandestine.

52:51.464 --> 52:53.670
Mr Ambiguous.

52:53.716 --> 52:55.756
Mr Mystery.

52:58.471 --> 52:59.882
Get out of there.

53:01.682 --> 53:03.639
Get out of there, Jake.

53:03.684 --> 53:07.978
No-one lives and displeases Gold.

53:08.022 --> 53:09.730
No-one but your two friends.

53:09.774 --> 53:12.775
Got to be something wrong with 'em
if Gold won't touch 'em.

53:12.818 --> 53:16.022
Got to be something wrong
if the Goldfather won't touch 'em.

53:16.072 --> 53:18.278
No-one sees Gold,

53:18.324 --> 53:20.530
but Gold sees everything.

53:21.619 --> 53:26.364
The smoke signals say,
"Dodge 'em like an angry bullet."

53:26.415 --> 53:29.867
Tell your friend to get out of there.

53:29.919 --> 53:32.410
Jake, get out of there.

53:32.463 --> 53:33.792
Get out of there.

53:33.839 --> 53:36.212
Get out of there.

53:47.353 --> 53:49.595
Tomorrow.

53:56.028 --> 53:58.104
You're worse than a stuck record.

53:58.155 --> 54:00.860
"Tomorrow, tomorrow."

54:00.908 --> 54:02.948
Tomorrow is never going to come, is it?

54:02.994 --> 54:04.452
Hello, it's warming up.

54:04.495 --> 54:07.579
Zach, kick him, see if that jogs him on.

54:07.623 --> 54:09.532
You want me to play mother?

54:09.584 --> 54:12.253
I took care of Horowitz. It's your turn.

54:17.842 --> 54:20.333
Change of plan.

54:20.386 --> 54:22.177
I can see what's coming.

54:22.221 --> 54:23.929
Give it to Mr Green.

54:30.104 --> 54:32.725
Mr Green.

54:32.773 --> 54:34.149
Shoot Fred for me.

54:37.153 --> 54:40.237
Not dead, stupid, just in the back of the knee.

54:40.281 --> 54:42.606
I ain't shooting Fred, Zach.

54:42.658 --> 54:47.071
Sometimes, a little voice
tells you to think about number one.

54:47.121 --> 54:48.781
Told you, Avi.

54:49.874 --> 54:53.409
Never had the gumption,
never going to have what it takes.

54:53.461 --> 54:55.288
It's easier than you think.

54:55.338 --> 54:58.007
It's one little squeeze,

54:58.049 --> 55:00.718
just like a tube of toothpaste.

55:00.760 --> 55:02.669
Who the fuck are you two?

55:02.720 --> 55:05.258
You can't see what's right in front of you.

55:05.306 --> 55:12.353
You're supposed to be stiff, cold and horizontal,
and you still don't trust us?

55:13.439 --> 55:16.773
Shoot him in the kneecap.
The debt has to be paid.

55:17.860 --> 55:21.360
And sometimes it's best to listen to it.

55:22.615 --> 55:24.691
Get your arse up, Fred.

55:27.286 --> 55:28.780
Go on. Get out.

55:31.707 --> 55:34.163
He can't do that, Jake.

55:34.210 --> 55:35.752
Then why don't you stop him, Avi?

55:35.795 --> 55:38.796
What the fuck do you know?
Shoot that toad now.

55:43.302 --> 55:44.927
One more step, Avi.

55:46.639 --> 55:48.548
Just like a squeeze of toothpaste.

55:50.685 --> 55:53.472
You realise what you're doing, Mr Green?

55:53.521 --> 55:59.227
Hold on, Jake. This isn't the plan.
This won't have a happy ending.

56:00.736 --> 56:02.361
One more step, Avi.

56:18.546 --> 56:20.585
Wake up, Mr Green.

56:58.836 --> 57:02.881
Congratulations, Mr Green.
It's past the third day and you have risen.

57:02.924 --> 57:05.000
I think you're due for a check-up.

57:12.099 --> 57:13.973
Did the bad guys get you?

57:14.018 --> 57:16.094
There's no such thing as "bad guys", Rachel.

57:16.145 --> 57:19.229
Yes, there are.
That's why Daddy's friends are looking after us.

57:19.273 --> 57:24.268
Never mind about that. Why don't you be a
good girl and get your Uncle Jake a cold drink?

57:34.872 --> 57:36.948
It's a bit of a mess, isn't it?

57:36.999 --> 57:39.122
Things will sort themselves out.

57:39.168 --> 57:41.244
Is she all right?

57:41.295 --> 57:44.581
Don't you worry about her.
You just look after yourself.

57:48.302 --> 57:51.089
Mr Green, I don't know how to tell you this.

57:51.138 --> 57:55.006
Our first results,
they must have been wrong.

57:59.772 --> 58:02.180
I cannot apologise enough for this error.

58:02.233 --> 58:05.981
You're not a well man, but...

58:26.757 --> 58:28.964
We have to assess our clients very carefully.

58:37.059 --> 58:41.686
There is something about yourself
that you don't know.

58:41.731 --> 58:45.859
Something that you will deny even exists

58:45.902 --> 58:50.231
until it's too late to do anything about it.

58:55.870 --> 58:59.737
It's the only reason you get up in the morning,

58:59.790 --> 59:03.325
the only reason you suffer the shitty boss,

59:03.377 --> 59:06.212
the blood, the sweat and the tears.

59:07.298 --> 59:09.670
This is because you want people to know

59:09.717 --> 59:15.921
how good, attractive, generous, funny,
wild and clever you really are.

59:15.973 --> 59:20.351
"Fear or revere me,
but please think I'm special."

59:21.437 --> 59:23.809
We share an addiction.

59:23.856 --> 59:26.098
We're approval junkies.

59:27.026 --> 59:29.482
We're all in it for the slap on the back

59:29.529 --> 59:31.605
and the gold watch.

59:31.656 --> 59:34.775
The "hip, hip, hoo-fucking-rah."

59:34.825 --> 59:39.238
Look at the clever boy
with the badge, polishing his trophy.

59:39.288 --> 59:42.788
Shine on, you crazy diamond.

59:42.833 --> 59:46.783
Cos we're just monkeys wrapped in suits,

59:46.837 --> 59:50.669
begging for the approval of others.

59:52.843 --> 59:55.928
If we knew this, we wouldn't do this.

59:55.972 --> 59:58.510
Someone is hiding it from us.

59:59.600 --> 01:00:03.812
And if you had a second chance,
you would ask...

01:00:03.855 --> 01:00:05.099
Why?

01:00:05.147 --> 01:00:07.223
- Why what?
- Why am I still alive?

01:00:07.275 --> 01:00:09.979
Why did you give my money away?

01:00:10.027 --> 01:00:12.103
Why didn't you want 'em to know?

01:00:13.364 --> 01:00:15.689
Why didn't you want me to know?

01:00:15.741 --> 01:00:17.734
You'll find out soon enough.

01:00:21.330 --> 01:00:23.406
Whilst I've been digging around on Lord John

01:00:23.457 --> 01:00:26.577
I came across a couple
of cash-talking shit-sniffers

01:00:26.627 --> 01:00:28.287
who came up with the name...

01:00:28.337 --> 01:00:29.997
Green.

01:00:30.047 --> 01:00:32.087
That's right, Jake Green.

01:00:32.133 --> 01:00:34.754
- Go on.
- I'm working for his brother.

01:00:34.802 --> 01:00:35.751
Patrick.

01:00:35.803 --> 01:00:40.714
A couple of opportunists, looking after
his older brother, got a little bit greedy.

01:00:40.766 --> 01:00:42.095
Want to impress you.

01:00:42.143 --> 01:00:46.852
All right, you take Sorter and Slim Biggins
and enough men to avoid an excuse.

01:00:50.401 --> 01:00:52.892
It's about fucking time.

01:00:55.907 --> 01:00:58.314
Now that is a picture.

01:00:59.410 --> 01:01:02.364
You took your sweet-ass time.
I was starting to get bored.

01:01:02.413 --> 01:01:04.536
You should have kept busy with a swim.

01:01:04.582 --> 01:01:08.449
Funny you should say that.
Zach's quite a swimmer, aren't you, Zach?

01:01:08.502 --> 01:01:10.709
20 lengths in ten seconds.

01:01:10.755 --> 01:01:15.832
We thought it might be a record. You want
to try to beat it? Come on in and join us.

01:01:15.885 --> 01:01:19.799
I'll just pop upstairs, grab my trunks,
and be down in a jiffy.

01:01:19.847 --> 01:01:23.097
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- Oh, and why is that, Avi?

01:01:23.142 --> 01:01:25.135
Why do you think we're in this icy birdbath,

01:01:25.186 --> 01:01:28.602
when we could be upstairs, toasty
and cosy, watching the naughty channel?

01:01:31.234 --> 01:01:35.314
How long can it take to get five coffees
and a couple of pizzas?

01:01:41.202 --> 01:01:43.609
You are on your own, Jakey boy.

01:01:48.751 --> 01:01:50.293
Move.

01:02:33.713 --> 01:02:35.836
You've got to tell the boss.

01:02:35.882 --> 01:02:37.958
Why me?

01:02:38.009 --> 01:02:40.334
Because you're the one who ordered the pizza.

01:02:53.691 --> 01:02:56.526
This time you're going to tell me what's going on.

01:02:56.569 --> 01:02:58.645
Two sugars, am I right?

01:02:58.696 --> 01:03:00.404
Forget the tea, Avi.

01:03:01.490 --> 01:03:03.567
Thank you, Jenny, that will be all.

01:03:06.412 --> 01:03:10.624
You didn't tell us the truth
about the three Eddies did you, Mr Green?

01:03:10.666 --> 01:03:12.789
The Eddies upset Macha in some way

01:03:12.835 --> 01:03:17.082
so he had them used as aggregate, and mixed
into some concrete on one of his buildings.

01:03:21.969 --> 01:03:25.219
Would you like us to remind you
of what really happened?

01:03:26.724 --> 01:03:30.259
The Eddies were waiting for you
when you got out of prison.

01:03:30.311 --> 01:03:32.350
It was Macha's fault.

01:03:32.396 --> 01:03:34.804
They didn't work for him any more,
and wanted to...

01:03:34.857 --> 01:03:36.020
...compensate you.

01:03:36.067 --> 01:03:38.106
What they really meant was they wanted...

01:03:38.152 --> 01:03:42.197
...to put 12 grams of angry lead
in the back of your fucking head.

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:45.110
But you gave them an offer they couldn't refuse.

01:03:45.159 --> 01:03:47.366
No-one kills a man
who's going to make 'em money.

01:03:47.411 --> 01:03:51.492
So you would give them 3% a month
on any money they would lend you.

01:03:51.541 --> 01:03:56.416
You needed the money quickly for some small
but profitable deal that you'd made on the inside.

01:03:56.462 --> 01:04:01.504
In fact, it was more profitable than any rate
they can get anywhere, legal or illegal.

01:04:01.551 --> 01:04:03.709
- So, one of them said...
- I'm in.

01:04:03.761 --> 01:04:07.426
- A month later he got his money back.
- Plus your 3%.

01:04:08.516 --> 01:04:11.967
- Now, nobody kills a man...
...who's going to make him money.

01:04:12.019 --> 01:04:15.020
- They always protect their investment.
- I can give you 4% a month.

01:04:15.064 --> 01:04:17.982
- You know this is just between us?
- That's right, Eddie.

01:04:18.025 --> 01:04:20.563
Next deal - this time they're all in.

01:04:20.611 --> 01:04:22.687
I give you 4% a month.

01:04:23.823 --> 01:04:27.951
For two years you always came through,
regular like clockwork.

01:04:27.994 --> 01:04:29.785
But there was no deal.

01:04:29.829 --> 01:04:34.158
You would take money off of one Eddie
and repay the other Eddie, plus the 4%.

01:04:34.208 --> 01:04:36.367
Plus your 4%. On top.

01:04:36.419 --> 01:04:40.463
You were not greedy, you did it nice and slow.

01:04:40.506 --> 01:04:42.250
You were paying for their trust.

01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:45.503
- This is just between us, right, Jake?
- That's right, Eddie.

01:04:45.553 --> 01:04:49.882
It was the easiest money they'd known. Soon
they couldn't give you their money fast enough.

01:04:49.932 --> 01:04:52.767
A few months later they didn't
have enough of their own to lend,

01:04:52.810 --> 01:04:55.099
so they started to borrow money off Macha.

01:04:55.146 --> 01:04:56.889
- 3%?
- Plus your 3%.

01:04:56.939 --> 01:04:59.311
- 4%?
- Plus your 4%.

01:05:00.610 --> 01:05:02.401
5%?

01:05:02.445 --> 01:05:04.022
Macha became interested.

01:05:04.071 --> 01:05:06.562
How could the Eddies
have such a good little earner?

01:05:06.616 --> 01:05:10.779
- They hid you like a dirty little secret.
- Find out who's behind this.

01:05:10.828 --> 01:05:12.073
Who's behind this?

01:05:13.372 --> 01:05:16.207
Ask no questions, hear no lies.

01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:19.500
- They tell anything but the truth.
- Find out if Green is behind this.

01:05:19.545 --> 01:05:23.922
- Is Jake Green behind this?
- I'll tell you, no, it's not Jake Green.

01:05:23.966 --> 01:05:28.379
- They'd do anything to protect their investment.
- I'm not sharing the golden goose.

01:05:28.429 --> 01:05:31.763
But Macha got his interest,
so he kept loaning them more and more.

01:05:31.807 --> 01:05:33.634
Lend them the money.

01:05:33.684 --> 01:05:37.764
You were back gambling, making more money
than you knew what to do with. You were rich.

01:05:37.813 --> 01:05:39.889
I am rich.

01:05:39.941 --> 01:05:41.814
Seriously fucking rich.

01:05:41.859 --> 01:05:45.939
After a year, you had enough of the Eddies'
money, or should I say Macha's money...

01:05:45.988 --> 01:05:50.816
- Now I'm richer. A lot fucking richer.
...to buy a chain of hotels.

01:05:50.868 --> 01:05:53.324
So you went on a discreet three-month holiday.

01:05:53.371 --> 01:05:57.368
You took your brother, his daughter,
Macha's money and you enjoyed yourself.

01:05:57.416 --> 01:06:01.366
A bit of the old sun, sand, sea and sausages.

01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:04.457
The Eddies meanwhile
were having a terminal argument...

01:06:05.550 --> 01:06:09.761
...about how they were going to pay back Macha
that obscene amount of cash they owed him.

01:06:09.804 --> 01:06:12.093
I want my money back, Paul.

01:06:15.601 --> 01:06:20.014
Those boys really suffered, Jake. The more
they told the truth, the more they suffered.

01:06:22.608 --> 01:06:25.645
- It's Jake Green.
- He's telling the fucking truth.

01:06:26.654 --> 01:06:29.608
They told me that story already.
Give me the truth.

01:06:30.658 --> 01:06:33.196
You gave them just enough rope
to hang themselves.

01:06:37.707 --> 01:06:39.783
You're a good little conman, Jake.

01:06:39.834 --> 01:06:46.631
And you think you're smart, and you are,
just not as smart as you think you are.

01:06:53.514 --> 01:06:55.590
Elvis. Come here.

01:06:57.768 --> 01:07:01.019
If I wanted vinegar,
I would have ordered French fries.

01:07:02.106 --> 01:07:05.309
Get me something with a price tag on it.

01:07:07.361 --> 01:07:10.362
...Mr Green. What did he do, anyway?

01:07:12.033 --> 01:07:14.109
Hamish?

01:07:18.247 --> 01:07:21.912
It's OK, we're among friends.
Come on, what have you got for me?

01:07:24.754 --> 01:07:26.627
What am I going to tell him?

01:07:26.672 --> 01:07:30.337
That's your problem, but it had better be good.

01:07:32.386 --> 01:07:34.462
I turned up to pick them up...

01:07:48.069 --> 01:07:50.275
...and that is what I saw.

01:07:54.450 --> 01:07:56.526
That's a fascinating story.

01:07:57.995 --> 01:08:00.071
I have one question for you.

01:08:01.749 --> 01:08:03.955
How?

01:08:04.001 --> 01:08:05.828
How what?

01:08:05.878 --> 01:08:07.954
"How what?"

01:08:08.005 --> 01:08:10.081
There were six of us,

01:08:10.132 --> 01:08:12.884
plus Slim Biggins, who counts as another six.

01:08:12.927 --> 01:08:14.884
How many were there of him?

01:08:17.265 --> 01:08:19.470
- One.
- One.

01:08:20.977 --> 01:08:26.647
So, how exactly did this "one"
manage to disarm and overpower

01:08:26.691 --> 01:08:30.189
a four-time national body-building champion,

01:08:33.072 --> 01:08:39.988
drag him half a block, throw him over a six-foot
wall and then get him to eat his own gun?

01:08:45.792 --> 01:08:47.537
Get down, boss.

01:08:48.462 --> 01:08:50.537
Just find the gunman.

01:08:51.841 --> 01:08:54.046
Don't fucking move.

01:08:54.093 --> 01:08:55.966
Lou. Lou.

01:08:57.305 --> 01:08:59.843
- Keep the boss down.
- What the fuck's going on?

01:09:02.727 --> 01:09:04.636
I don't know.

01:09:04.687 --> 01:09:07.095
Sorter just shot the...

01:09:09.399 --> 01:09:11.558
...and he went in the kitchen.

01:09:11.611 --> 01:09:14.232
- Nobody fucking move.
- Bastard.

01:09:21.912 --> 01:09:23.822
Keep the fucking boss down.

01:11:46.515 --> 01:11:48.722
She shot my finger off.

01:11:48.768 --> 01:11:50.725
The bitch shot my finger off.

01:12:00.655 --> 01:12:02.731
Who is it?

01:12:07.578 --> 01:12:09.072
Happy Tony, Lord John's man.

01:12:10.164 --> 01:12:13.118
Not looking so happy now, is he?

01:12:18.089 --> 01:12:19.880
Check she's dead, Lou.

01:12:20.758 --> 01:12:22.881
Greed gets them all in the end.

01:12:28.182 --> 01:12:30.305
Now, shoot straight, Sorter.

01:12:30.351 --> 01:12:33.103
Glad to see you've got those feelings in check.

01:12:40.570 --> 01:12:45.812
Find a couple of Lord John's boys and
persuade them to tell you where my powder is.

01:14:19.001 --> 01:14:21.919
What is the first rule of any game, Mr Green?

01:14:24.006 --> 01:14:27.755
The only way to get smarter
is by playing a smarter opponent.

01:14:27.802 --> 01:14:30.507
What's rule two of any game?

01:14:30.555 --> 01:14:34.469
The more sophisticated the game,
the more sophisticated the opponent.

01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:38.264
Almost the same,
but where does it stop, Mr Green?

01:14:39.355 --> 01:14:41.680
Where does this game stop?

01:14:41.732 --> 01:14:44.568
It stops when you start to give me answers.

01:14:44.610 --> 01:14:47.018
Don't let them play head games with you, Jake.

01:14:47.071 --> 01:14:49.858
Is it me that's playing head games with you,
Mr Green?

01:14:57.582 --> 01:15:00.867
You've heard their voice for so long,
you believe it to be you.

01:15:02.879 --> 01:15:05.548
You believe it to be your best friend.

01:15:06.173 --> 01:15:09.459
They should believe
their opponent to be their best friend.

01:15:09.510 --> 01:15:12.215
Where's the best place
an opponent should hide?

01:15:13.973 --> 01:15:16.974
In the very last place you would ever look.

01:15:17.018 --> 01:15:20.766
Do you know who Sam Gold is, Mr Green?

01:15:20.813 --> 01:15:22.889
You should,

01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:25.727
because he knows who you are.

01:15:25.776 --> 01:15:27.650
The Gold,

01:15:27.695 --> 01:15:29.569
Sam Gold.

01:15:29.614 --> 01:15:31.357
Mr Clandestine.

01:15:31.407 --> 01:15:33.281
Mr Ambiguous.

01:15:33.326 --> 01:15:35.733
Mr Mystery.

01:15:35.786 --> 01:15:37.862
He's all up here,

01:15:38.956 --> 01:15:40.949
pretending to be you.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.456
No-one sees Gold,

01:15:43.502 --> 01:15:45.910
but Gold sees everything.

01:15:45.963 --> 01:15:48.039
You're in a game, Jake.

01:15:48.090 --> 01:15:50.166
You're in the game.

01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:53.336
Everyone's in his game,

01:15:53.387 --> 01:15:55.463
and nobody knows it.

01:15:55.514 --> 01:15:59.761
And all of this, this is his world.

01:15:59.810 --> 01:16:01.305
He owns it.

01:16:02.396 --> 01:16:04.685
He controls it.

01:16:04.732 --> 01:16:07.852
I've had enough of this shit.
Tell him you've had enough.

01:16:07.902 --> 01:16:09.562
He tells you what to do...

01:16:09.612 --> 01:16:12.185
- Look, that's enough.
...and when to do it.

01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:15.573
- Tell him.
- I said that's enough, Avi.

01:16:15.618 --> 01:16:19.865
Eventually, when the opponent
is challenged or questioned,

01:16:19.914 --> 01:16:24.375
it means the victim's investment
and thus his intelligence is questioned.

01:16:25.419 --> 01:16:27.211
No-one can accept that,

01:16:28.297 --> 01:16:30.420
not even to themselves.

01:16:32.969 --> 01:16:35.970
He's behind all the pain there ever was.

01:16:38.182 --> 01:16:41.432
Behind every crime ever committed.

01:16:47.024 --> 01:16:53.738
How can I be behind all the pain,
all the crime, if I don't even exist?

01:16:53.781 --> 01:17:00.116
And right now,
he's telling you that he doesn't even exist.

01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:07.001
No-one lives and displeases Gold.

01:17:07.044 --> 01:17:09.037
No-one but your two friends.

01:17:10.131 --> 01:17:13.879
We just put you to war
with the only enemy that ever existed,

01:17:13.926 --> 01:17:17.093
and you, you think he's your best friend.

01:17:17.138 --> 01:17:22.049
And they will protect their best friend
with everything they've got.

01:17:23.144 --> 01:17:26.145
You're protecting him, Mr Green,

01:17:28.357 --> 01:17:30.433
but with what?

01:17:30.484 --> 01:17:33.521
Where's the best place
an opponent should hide?

01:17:36.032 --> 01:17:38.238
In the very last place you'd ever look.

01:17:38.284 --> 01:17:41.368
He's hiding behind your pain, Jake.

01:17:46.083 --> 01:17:48.290
You're protecting him with your pain.

01:17:49.337 --> 01:17:54.544
Embrace the pain and you will win this game.

01:17:56.844 --> 01:18:02.598
And I know nothing hurts more
than humiliation and a little money loss.

01:18:02.642 --> 01:18:06.011
If you change the rules on what controls you...

01:18:06.062 --> 01:18:10.142
...you will change the rules
on what you can control.

01:18:11.192 --> 01:18:14.691
How radical are you prepared to be, Mr Green?

01:18:38.844 --> 01:18:42.344
The more power
you think you have in Gold's world,

01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:45.474
the less power you have in the real world.

01:18:48.271 --> 01:18:50.347
You are still in prison, Jake.

01:18:50.398 --> 01:18:53.517
In fact, you never left.

01:18:53.568 --> 01:18:57.945
Remember who they are, Jake.
Head tricksters, word slicksters.

01:18:57.989 --> 01:19:00.610
You wanted answers and they gave you riddles.

01:19:00.658 --> 01:19:04.276
You know the rules,
the longer you listened, the sweeter the pitch.

01:19:04.328 --> 01:19:07.532
He's got all the tricks and all the right answers.

01:19:08.916 --> 01:19:13.625
Don't let them do this to you, Jake.
Don't let them turn you against you.

01:19:16.632 --> 01:19:20.677
You don't give because it's good.
You give because it hurts him.

01:19:42.116 --> 01:19:44.192
What are we doing here?

01:19:45.244 --> 01:19:47.949
He's the enemy, Jake, not me.

01:19:47.997 --> 01:19:51.995
Use your perceived enemy
to destroy your real enemy.

01:19:52.043 --> 01:19:55.708
Do not listen, Jake.
You've got a gun. Use it.

01:19:57.173 --> 01:19:59.212
Don't wake him up. Suffocate him.

01:19:59.258 --> 01:20:02.378
Put the pillow over his head and suffocate him.

01:20:02.428 --> 01:20:05.180
He'd do it to you, Jake.

01:20:05.223 --> 01:20:08.058
If you can't do it, then you're not a free man.

01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:10.473
You are controlled.

01:20:10.519 --> 01:20:13.141
"Controlled? Free man?"

01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:15.644
Jake, wake up.

01:20:24.784 --> 01:20:29.362
Look, Mr Macha, I'm very sorry
to have woken you. Please listen to me.

01:20:31.666 --> 01:20:34.287
Who's that? Mr Green?

01:20:34.335 --> 01:20:38.831
Mr Macha, please, I'm sorry to have woken you.
Listen to me.

01:20:38.881 --> 01:20:41.289
"Sorry." Listen at how you sound.

01:20:42.718 --> 01:20:44.545
I came to apologise.

01:20:44.595 --> 01:20:48.640
Forgive me for the things I've said
and for cheating you out of your money.

01:20:48.683 --> 01:20:50.509
I couldn't think clearly.

01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:52.848
- Shut up.
- No, no, that's too much.

01:20:52.895 --> 01:20:57.059
Shoot the fucker. Shoot him.
He's been trying to kill you.

01:20:57.108 --> 01:21:00.228
He killed your friend, shot like a fucking dog.

01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:05.104
That's better, Jake, in control again.
Do the right thing.

01:21:05.157 --> 01:21:08.158
Take care of your enemy, take care of business.

01:21:08.202 --> 01:21:12.911
Use any means possible
to induce head pain, and engage the enemy.

01:21:12.957 --> 01:21:14.831
Shut up.

01:21:14.876 --> 01:21:17.830
Wake up, Jake.
What are you fucking doing?

01:21:17.879 --> 01:21:19.955
Leave it.

01:21:20.006 --> 01:21:22.082
You're grovelling.

01:21:22.133 --> 01:21:25.502
I now realise you're a man
to be feared and respected.

01:21:29.348 --> 01:21:32.385
I now realise you're a man
to be feared and respected.

01:21:32.435 --> 01:21:34.344
Stop grovelling.

01:21:36.314 --> 01:21:38.390
Where's your pride?

01:21:45.239 --> 01:21:46.568
Where's your pride?

01:21:46.616 --> 01:21:49.533
I made a big mistake, Mr Macha.
Shut up.

01:21:49.577 --> 01:21:52.744
I underestimated your power and your intellect.

01:21:52.788 --> 01:21:56.489
I've made a donation in your name
as a peace offering,

01:21:57.585 --> 01:21:59.874
as a token of my apology.

01:22:01.589 --> 01:22:04.044
I want you to...

01:22:04.091 --> 01:22:06.167
Shut up.

01:22:06.219 --> 01:22:08.128
I want you to forgive my stupidity.

01:22:30.952 --> 01:22:35.779
Wherever you don't want to go
is where you will find him.

01:22:37.917 --> 01:22:41.001
What is it that you are afraid of, Mr Green?

01:23:26.215 --> 01:23:28.920
Why are you doing this to yourself, Jake?

01:23:28.968 --> 01:23:31.044
It's too tight, Jake.

01:23:32.138 --> 01:23:34.214
We've got to get out.

01:23:35.266 --> 01:23:37.638
You're going to die in a tiny space, Jake.

01:23:42.523 --> 01:23:44.599
Have to get out.

01:23:47.778 --> 01:23:49.652
We're stuck, stuck.

01:23:49.697 --> 01:23:51.773
The walls are moving in.

01:23:53.534 --> 01:23:55.610
It's tight. I'm scared.

01:23:55.661 --> 01:23:58.746
We've got to get out. I can hear you.

01:24:02.919 --> 01:24:04.792
I can hear you.

01:24:04.837 --> 01:24:05.868
What?

01:24:05.922 --> 01:24:08.294
I can hear you.

01:24:08.341 --> 01:24:10.629
I'm onto you.

01:24:17.516 --> 01:24:20.352
Who takes care of the good times?

01:24:20.394 --> 01:24:23.146
- We're a team.
- We're best pals, Jake.

01:24:23.189 --> 01:24:27.352
- You want to get rid of me?
- Do you know life without me?

01:24:27.401 --> 01:24:31.233
- No. Because it doesn't...
...exist.

01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:33.107
- Do they talk about me, Jake?
- No.

01:24:33.157 --> 01:24:35.233
Because I don't exist.

01:24:35.284 --> 01:24:39.578
- Tell all your friends about me then, Jake?
- I protect you and I control you.

01:24:39.622 --> 01:24:41.698
I say do, you obey.

01:24:41.749 --> 01:24:44.620
- If I say you're scared...
...you're scared.

01:24:44.669 --> 01:24:47.788
You've been listening to the other side,
haven't you, Jake?

01:24:47.838 --> 01:24:50.958
- Listening to people who want to hurt you.
- New people. New.

01:24:51.008 --> 01:24:53.084
Not old friends like me.

01:24:53.135 --> 01:24:57.762
People you shouldn't trust. Not me. I've been
your friend forever, since the beginning.

01:24:57.807 --> 01:25:00.927
Get rid of them, Jake, forever.
They're the enemy, not me.

01:25:00.977 --> 01:25:04.143
They're new, I'm old. I stay, they go.

01:25:04.188 --> 01:25:06.726
I say you do.

01:25:06.774 --> 01:25:07.889
You do.

01:25:07.942 --> 01:25:10.018
You're weak without me, weak.

01:25:10.069 --> 01:25:11.860
It's us against them, Jake.

01:25:11.904 --> 01:25:14.442
It's us against them.

01:25:14.490 --> 01:25:16.898
I'm coming to get you.

01:25:16.951 --> 01:25:19.703
You want to get rid of me?
You want to make an enemy out of me?

01:25:19.745 --> 01:25:21.904
You want to get rid of me, do you?

01:25:21.956 --> 01:25:23.534
Do you?

01:25:23.583 --> 01:25:26.121
You want to get rid of me, me, me, me?

01:25:41.475 --> 01:25:44.097
Still here, Jake?

01:25:44.145 --> 01:25:47.596
How long have I looked after you?

01:25:47.648 --> 01:25:49.807
You can't win this one without me.

01:25:51.485 --> 01:25:54.107
You know why?

01:25:55.198 --> 01:25:57.274
I am you.

01:26:00.453 --> 01:26:02.529
You ain't me.

01:26:03.873 --> 01:26:12.711
The greatest con that he ever pulled,
was making you believe that he is you.

01:26:14.091 --> 01:26:16.380
You ain't me.

01:26:16.427 --> 01:26:19.761
- I am you.
- You're not me.

01:26:19.805 --> 01:26:21.348
Come on.

01:26:24.477 --> 01:26:26.719
Your best fucking friend.

01:26:30.650 --> 01:26:33.105
I am you.

01:26:42.870 --> 01:26:44.946
You don't control me.

01:26:45.957 --> 01:26:47.783
I control you.

01:27:20.408 --> 01:27:24.951
You come to my house with a loaded gun.

01:27:26.247 --> 01:27:30.541
You speak to me like I'm a fucking idiot.

01:27:32.044 --> 01:27:34.120
What's your game?

01:27:35.631 --> 01:27:37.707
What's your game?

01:27:39.176 --> 01:27:41.253
Speak to me.

01:27:43.014 --> 01:27:45.090
Speak to me.

01:27:45.141 --> 01:27:48.806
Or I'll kill you like the fucking dog that you are.

01:27:55.651 --> 01:27:57.727
Fear me.

01:28:08.998 --> 01:28:11.240
Fear me.

01:29:14.689 --> 01:29:18.223
We have already killed Lord John
and two of your colleagues.

01:29:18.276 --> 01:29:22.225
If you value your life
more than a few bags of white powder,

01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:24.356
you will tell me...

01:29:24.407 --> 01:29:26.446
where it is hidden.

01:29:52.602 --> 01:29:54.678
Is everything all right, Mr D?

01:29:55.771 --> 01:29:58.689
It will be when you take care
of my security, Paul.

01:29:59.859 --> 01:30:01.935
What are you holding the papers for?

01:30:03.029 --> 01:30:05.983
Because you're on the cover of half of them.

01:30:07.700 --> 01:30:11.235
If you don't mind me asking,
what has come over you, Mr D?

01:30:15.917 --> 01:30:17.993
They think you did it.

01:30:22.131 --> 01:30:25.630
Oh, my god.
Take the credit, they'll never know.

01:30:26.719 --> 01:30:29.175
This feels good.

01:30:35.895 --> 01:30:37.971
This feels quite good.

01:30:38.022 --> 01:30:40.311
I'm going to take the credit.

01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:43.689
It might come as a surprise to you, Paul,

01:30:46.322 --> 01:30:48.398
but I do have a heart.

01:30:52.078 --> 01:30:54.569
I have some news about Green.

01:30:54.622 --> 01:30:57.113
I'll give you news about Green.

01:30:57.166 --> 01:31:00.286
He now knows who's boss.

01:31:00.336 --> 01:31:04.334
He was snivelling like a baby
begging for forgiveness.

01:31:04.382 --> 01:31:08.593
It was embarrassing. We're not going to
be hearing from Mr Green for a while.

01:31:08.636 --> 01:31:11.756
I'm not sure if that's the case, Mr D.

01:31:12.848 --> 01:31:15.553
Whilst you've been sleeping, we've been busy.

01:31:15.601 --> 01:31:21.355
If Lord John's boys know where the powder is,
they took it to the grave.

01:31:21.399 --> 01:31:24.068
We know Green's behind everything.

01:31:24.110 --> 01:31:26.980
He took your powder, not Lord John.

01:31:27.029 --> 01:31:31.775
He's been playing games with us,
and he's been playing games with you.

01:31:31.826 --> 01:31:34.032
Fear me. Fear me.

01:31:34.078 --> 01:31:36.450
- Shut up.
- Fear me.

01:31:36.497 --> 01:31:38.869
- Shut up.
- Fear me.

01:31:38.916 --> 01:31:42.368
- It doesn't look good.
- Shut up.

01:31:42.420 --> 01:31:46.085
It doesn't look good.
The drums have been talking.

01:31:56.309 --> 01:31:58.348
And what have the drums been saying?

01:31:58.394 --> 01:32:02.059
They've been saying
what Sam Gold's been hearing.

01:32:04.442 --> 01:32:06.730
Fear me.

01:32:06.777 --> 01:32:11.819
Hearing about the little problems Mr Green
has been giving us, that's embarrassing.

01:32:11.866 --> 01:32:15.235
We have an address for his brother.
We can take care of it.

01:32:15.286 --> 01:32:17.777
Get him to talk, do whatever it takes.

01:32:17.830 --> 01:32:21.080
Take Sorter and an army.
If they give any trouble, hurt 'em.

01:32:21.125 --> 01:32:23.201
Let me read about that in the paper.

01:32:23.252 --> 01:32:26.870
Get a hold of Green and get my powder.

01:32:28.216 --> 01:32:30.208
Go.

01:32:46.776 --> 01:32:48.899
Are we expecting anyone?

01:32:48.945 --> 01:32:51.649
I'll get it.

01:32:51.697 --> 01:32:54.615
I said, are we expecting anyone?

01:32:54.659 --> 01:32:56.735
Shouldn't you check first?

01:33:09.215 --> 01:33:14.506
If you love your daddy,
be a good girl, hide in that cupboard.

01:33:14.554 --> 01:33:16.630
Now.

01:33:45.167 --> 01:33:47.290
Check the house.

01:33:49.964 --> 01:33:52.206
You know why we're here?

01:33:55.386 --> 01:33:57.011
Serpent.

01:34:02.268 --> 01:34:07.974
I said, do you know why we're here?

01:34:09.066 --> 01:34:12.067
I've some kind of an idea, yes.

01:34:13.154 --> 01:34:15.526
Are you going to tell me?

01:34:15.573 --> 01:34:17.649
Paul, I swear to you,

01:34:18.743 --> 01:34:21.530
I haven't got a fucking clue where he is.

01:34:27.793 --> 01:34:29.869
He's been moving about.

01:34:30.963 --> 01:34:33.454
I swear to you, I have no idea where he is.

01:34:38.221 --> 01:34:40.297
It's all right.

01:34:43.434 --> 01:34:46.637
That's it. That's better. That's better.

01:35:03.538 --> 01:35:06.207
I still don't believe you.

01:35:13.130 --> 01:35:16.546
You can't trust anyone.
They're out to destroy me.

01:35:16.592 --> 01:35:19.083
They're out to destroy you.

01:35:19.136 --> 01:35:21.972
- You can't trust anyone.
- I can't trust anyone.

01:35:24.100 --> 01:35:26.176
Can't let Gold down.

01:35:27.270 --> 01:35:29.346
He'll finish the business.

01:35:30.439 --> 01:35:32.515
Then he'll finish me.

01:35:33.985 --> 01:35:36.061
He's coming.

01:35:36.112 --> 01:35:38.188
I won't see it coming.

01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:46.280
He's coming. And I won't see it coming.

01:35:46.330 --> 01:35:48.406
There's a woman here to see you, Mr D.

01:35:51.043 --> 01:35:53.119
Said she cannot wait.

01:35:54.881 --> 01:35:56.957
Don't tell me her name.

01:35:57.008 --> 01:36:00.626
- Says she works for Gold.
- Don't tell me her name. Anyone but her.

01:36:00.678 --> 01:36:03.430
- What's her name?
- Walker.

01:36:03.472 --> 01:36:04.671
Anyone but her.

01:36:04.724 --> 01:36:08.721
And everybody thought you were
such a disgusting man, Mr Macha.

01:36:09.937 --> 01:36:12.938
Here it comes. Here it comes.

01:36:12.982 --> 01:36:17.110
Mr Gold wishes to extend his respect
for such a magnanimous gesture.

01:36:17.153 --> 01:36:18.944
But he was wondering...

01:36:18.988 --> 01:36:21.277
- That's a wreath.
- That's a fucking wreath.

01:36:21.324 --> 01:36:24.241
...if you can afford the time to give so generously,

01:36:24.285 --> 01:36:26.906
why you haven't had time
to conclude our business?

01:36:26.954 --> 01:36:29.196
Everything's under control. I need more time.

01:36:29.248 --> 01:36:32.368
It's anything but under control,
isn't it, Mr Macha?

01:36:34.045 --> 01:36:36.121
Mr Gold doesn't give more time.

01:36:38.257 --> 01:36:40.250
And he doesn't give second chances.

01:36:43.679 --> 01:36:45.755
You will be hearing from him.

01:36:45.806 --> 01:36:47.633
Good day.

01:36:47.683 --> 01:36:50.637
"Good day?" What the fuck does that mean?

01:36:50.686 --> 01:36:52.762
What the fuck does that mean?

01:36:52.813 --> 01:36:55.387
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?

01:36:55.441 --> 01:36:57.517
Some fucking street hustler?

01:36:57.568 --> 01:37:01.483
If he wants to meet me, you send him here
and we'll see what he has to say.

01:37:03.658 --> 01:37:06.065
I'll kill 'em, I'll kill all of 'em.

01:37:06.118 --> 01:37:08.194
I'll kill 'em first.

01:37:08.246 --> 01:37:11.449
They'll kill us first, they'll fucking annihilate me.

01:37:11.499 --> 01:37:13.575
Beg, beg. Take it back, beg, beg.

01:37:13.626 --> 01:37:15.702
Beg, you idiot.

01:37:15.753 --> 01:37:19.288
Wait, wait. I didn't mean what I just said.

01:37:26.305 --> 01:37:29.223
"Good day?" What the fuck does that mean?

01:37:29.267 --> 01:37:33.810
That means he's going to end my game
and I won't see it coming.

01:38:13.352 --> 01:38:15.760
I'm going to make this fair.

01:38:15.813 --> 01:38:17.557
This...

01:38:18.649 --> 01:38:20.725
...is for you.

01:38:23.738 --> 01:38:25.362
These...

01:38:27.074 --> 01:38:29.150
...for me.

01:38:32.330 --> 01:38:37.075
One good chop, and you'll make the sink.

01:38:40.421 --> 01:38:42.627
OK, that's enough.

01:38:45.593 --> 01:38:50.089
Question me again, Sorter,
and we will have a falling out.

01:39:01.525 --> 01:39:03.684
Tell me what's happening, Lou.

01:39:03.736 --> 01:39:08.528
I got tired of waiting by the car, so I went inside.

01:39:08.574 --> 01:39:13.532
Paul, he was getting excited,
you know how he does.

01:39:13.579 --> 01:39:15.821
He started messing with the little girl's hair.

01:39:15.873 --> 01:39:17.533
Out of nowhere, Sorter shot him.

01:39:17.583 --> 01:39:19.540
Your daddy loves you so much.

01:39:19.585 --> 01:39:21.044
- Shot who?
- Paul.

01:39:23.422 --> 01:39:27.171
Then he turned the gun on the two bodyguards,
both gone in a blink of an eye.

01:39:33.015 --> 01:39:35.091
Listen to me, sweetheart.

01:39:35.142 --> 01:39:37.384
None of this is real.

01:39:37.436 --> 01:39:39.892
It's just a game that the grown-ups are playing.

01:39:41.023 --> 01:39:42.897
Now what I want you to do,

01:39:42.942 --> 01:39:47.271
I want you to get in the cupboard
and I want you to put your fingers in your ears,

01:39:47.321 --> 01:39:49.480
and it'll be all over before you know it.

01:39:49.532 --> 01:39:51.608
Do as the man says, babe.

01:39:51.659 --> 01:39:54.232
Put your fingers in your ears
and go in the cupboard.

01:39:54.996 --> 01:39:56.371
Good girl.

01:39:56.414 --> 01:39:58.537
Pull yourself together, man.

01:39:58.583 --> 01:40:01.916
Sorter, we're going to have to take the girl.

01:40:01.961 --> 01:40:05.579
Of course you have.
Now all you've got to do is come and get her.

01:42:06.252 --> 01:42:08.291
I'm the only one left.

01:42:08.337 --> 01:42:09.796
Where's the girl?

01:42:20.266 --> 01:42:22.342
What are we doing here?

01:42:22.393 --> 01:42:24.469
One last treat,

01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:26.596
and bring the powder.

01:42:36.532 --> 01:42:38.691
Jake Green is in the Casino.

01:42:41.454 --> 01:42:43.530
How the fuck does he know?

01:43:01.766 --> 01:43:03.675
Why are we here?

01:43:03.726 --> 01:43:05.802
You have a meeting.

01:43:07.688 --> 01:43:09.764
Got a little time to spare.

01:43:09.815 --> 01:43:12.057
Let's have a game.

01:43:12.109 --> 01:43:14.482
Bring him up.

01:43:33.881 --> 01:43:37.215
You know what's so elegant
about this little game, Jake?

01:43:39.470 --> 01:43:41.546
Nobody knows where the enemy is.

01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:44.882
They don't even know he exists.

01:43:51.399 --> 01:43:54.103
He's in every one of their heads.

01:43:54.151 --> 01:43:56.061
And they trust him...

01:43:59.282 --> 01:44:01.358
...because they think they are him.

01:44:04.412 --> 01:44:11.161
If you try to destroy him to save them,
they'll destroy you to save him.

01:44:11.210 --> 01:44:13.286
It's beautiful, man.

01:44:14.130 --> 01:44:17.084
You have to admire the opponent's elegance.

01:44:17.133 --> 01:44:19.042
Check.

01:44:23.806 --> 01:44:28.682
You're quite good at this game, Mr Green.
I know because I'm quite good at this game.

01:44:33.357 --> 01:44:35.017
Check.

01:44:43.367 --> 01:44:44.826
Check.

01:44:52.501 --> 01:44:55.039
Check.

01:45:03.554 --> 01:45:08.893
The art is for me to feed pieces to you,
and make you believe you took those pieces,

01:45:08.935 --> 01:45:13.312
because you're smarter and I'm dumber.

01:45:24.492 --> 01:45:25.654
Checkmate.

01:45:40.591 --> 01:45:42.584
Wake up, Mr Green.

01:45:46.931 --> 01:45:49.089
You can't see what's right in front of you.

01:45:55.439 --> 01:45:58.891
I never saw or spoke to those boys
in all those years,

01:45:58.943 --> 01:46:02.526
but you know
I would have died for either one of them.

01:46:02.572 --> 01:46:05.941
One was a chess master,
the other a master conman.

01:46:05.992 --> 01:46:09.526
Dangerous combination, chess and cons.

01:46:12.874 --> 01:46:15.115
Those two knew everything about me.

01:46:15.167 --> 01:46:18.999
All my dirty little secrets,
how much money I had, where I kept it.

01:46:19.046 --> 01:46:21.584
Hustling bastards cleaned me out.

01:46:27.722 --> 01:46:31.589
My neighbours used to write down chess moves
and concepts of the con

01:46:31.642 --> 01:46:37.229
in the back pages of books based on subjects
like The Mathematics Of Quantum Mechanics.

01:46:37.273 --> 01:46:38.553
Wake up, Mr Green.

01:46:38.608 --> 01:46:41.525
We were all going to go together,
they swore to me.

01:46:41.569 --> 01:46:43.727
"You're coming with us, Jake."

01:46:43.779 --> 01:46:46.946
We were always going to take you with us, Jake.

01:46:46.991 --> 01:46:51.285
You just weren't ready to hear
how hard that was going to be.

01:46:56.083 --> 01:46:58.242
We didn't do this because we like you.

01:46:59.754 --> 01:47:01.830
We did this because...

01:47:04.383 --> 01:47:06.542
...we are you.

01:47:24.570 --> 01:47:26.646
Time for that meeting.

01:47:27.740 --> 01:47:30.278
Give him what he wants.

01:47:30.326 --> 01:47:32.532
I'm sure that will make him very happy.

01:47:50.054 --> 01:47:54.763
I know you're still there,
cos I can feel you dying.

01:47:55.851 --> 01:47:59.896
I can hear you, tapping me for a little nutrition.

01:48:01.983 --> 01:48:04.059
Now who's clucking for a fix?

01:48:04.110 --> 01:48:06.980
Think it's a little tight in here, do you?

01:48:08.030 --> 01:48:12.408
You're not wrong,
cos the walls are moving in.

01:48:13.494 --> 01:48:16.828
No food here, not today, sunshine.

01:48:17.915 --> 01:48:20.702
My eyes are open and the restaurant's closed.

01:48:20.751 --> 01:48:23.788
Jog on, slide off.

01:48:23.838 --> 01:48:26.543
Find someone else to fill your pipe,

01:48:26.591 --> 01:48:32.545
someone who won't see you coming
or know when you're there.

01:48:38.561 --> 01:48:43.057
You think I'm an evil man.
You think I am an evil man, don't you?

01:48:44.567 --> 01:48:47.402
Rachel, look at me, honey.

01:48:51.449 --> 01:48:54.022
Think I don't know your fucking game?

01:48:54.076 --> 01:48:58.738
I do, I know your game,
I see your game, I am your game.

01:48:58.789 --> 01:49:02.123
Rachel, look at me, baby.

01:49:05.755 --> 01:49:09.040
You don't play by the rules, Mr Green.

01:49:09.091 --> 01:49:15.758
You like to play silly games with my head,
don't you?

01:49:18.643 --> 01:49:22.059
- You're a fucking survivor,
- A winner.

01:49:22.104 --> 01:49:26.149
- You're a pussy drowning in his own shit.
- Shut up and leave me alone.

01:49:27.276 --> 01:49:29.946
He chose his hiding place very carefully.

01:49:29.987 --> 01:49:32.905
I can't let him kill me.

01:49:32.949 --> 01:49:35.025
You're weak. It's too late.

01:49:35.076 --> 01:49:37.567
You're a dead man anyway.
You'll be dead before dawn.

01:49:37.620 --> 01:49:40.241
The word "excuse" does not exist
in Sam Gold's lexicon.

01:49:40.289 --> 01:49:42.697
This is Sam Gold I found myself chained to.

01:49:42.750 --> 01:49:44.826
Mr Black Magic.

01:49:44.877 --> 01:49:46.953
Mr "l-run-this-game" Gold.

01:49:47.004 --> 01:49:50.005
We can't see Gold.
Apparently, no-one sees Gold.

01:49:50.049 --> 01:49:51.840
No-one gets away from Gold.

01:49:53.928 --> 01:49:55.802
Get control of yourself.

01:49:55.846 --> 01:49:59.050
It's anything but under control,
isn't it, Mr Macha?

01:49:59.100 --> 01:50:03.809
He's going to kill me, he'll kill me.
Where's your pride? Where's your pride?

01:50:07.900 --> 01:50:10.937
I'd rather kill myself than let him kill me.

01:50:13.114 --> 01:50:16.483
Why isn't he scared? He's just staring at me.

01:50:19.245 --> 01:50:22.863
- You'll be hearing from him.
- But he can't kill a dead man.

01:50:22.915 --> 01:50:25.406
But he can't kill a dead man,

01:50:25.459 --> 01:50:27.535
can he?

01:50:31.591 --> 01:50:33.667
He can't kill a dead man, can he?

01:50:40.266 --> 01:50:42.638
You can't even do it, can you?

01:50:54.947 --> 01:50:58.197
The greatest con that he ever pulled

01:50:59.285 --> 01:51:02.120
...was making you believe...

01:51:03.206 --> 01:51:04.924
...that he is you.
