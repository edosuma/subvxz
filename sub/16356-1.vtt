else to take his place.

next owl that comes up.

23:04.880 --> 23:08.760

23:08.880 --> 23:11.000
His behavior in the

something sentimental.

your hand, you go up,

24:30.920 --> 24:32.360
They're things that

him for the greater good.

between us and the uprising

Nina!

45:50.040 --> 45:52.520
[gurgling screaming]

46:03.440 --> 46:06.440
Here he is,
the legendary Condor,

46:06.560 --> 46:09.960
now nothing but a traitor.

46:19.640 --> 46:23.240
You killed 12 of my men.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.920
I happened to have
liked a few of them.

46:34.280 --> 46:36.480
You have scars on your body,

46:36.600 --> 46:43.400
but tell me,
have you ever felt real pain?

46:47.720 --> 46:51.880
[grunting]

46:54.400 --> 46:56.560
Well done.

46:56.680 --> 47:00.920
I see I have something
to work with.

47:01.040 --> 47:05.240
This, this was just foreplay.

47:06.680 --> 47:09.520
Smile at the camera.

47:09.640 --> 47:12.560
Your being beamed live,

47:12.680 --> 47:17.120
<i>on our small private network.</i>

47:18.360 --> 47:20.760
By the time I finish with you,

47:20.880 --> 47:26.480
no agent will dare
go against the State.

47:29.840 --> 47:32.440
Ladies and gentleman of sin,

47:32.560 --> 47:36.520
<i>let this be a warning
to all of you.</i>

47:36.640 --> 47:39.520
<i>This is what will happen,</i>

47:39.640 --> 47:43.920
<i>if you turn your
backs on the State.</i>

47:49.640 --> 47:54.600
There is no way that you
would have gotten yourself out

47:54.720 --> 47:59.560
without help from
someone inside.

48:02.560 --> 48:06.160
The only question now,

48:06.280 --> 48:09.160
is who is helping.

48:14.960 --> 48:16.640
Ooh,

48:16.760 --> 48:20.360
your toenails look like
they need a little trimming.

48:27.560 --> 48:31.080
[screams]

48:36.160 --> 48:41.200
Machines, computers,
and reconditioning;

48:41.320 --> 48:42.920
a load of shit.

48:43.040 --> 48:46.240
Torture is best done simply,

48:46.360 --> 48:50.520
- like feeling your teeth...
- No.

48:50.640 --> 48:51.760
- being ripped...
- No.

48:51.880 --> 48:55.640
- ...out of your mouth.
- No.

48:55.760 --> 49:01.400
I need the name.

49:03.360 --> 49:07.320
No, no, no.

49:07.440 --> 49:09.760
No, no!

49:09.880 --> 49:13.400
[screaming]

49:13.520 --> 49:17.080
[men and swords clamoring]

49:24.160 --> 49:26.640
<i>[screaming]</i>

49:59.360 --> 50:01.160
You getting bored?

50:01.280 --> 50:02.920
I'm getting bored.

50:03.040 --> 50:06.920
I need to know a name.

50:11.600 --> 50:14.400
What was your plan, Condor?

50:16.760 --> 50:18.600
Where were you gonna go?

50:18.720 --> 50:20.680
We're everywhere.

50:20.800 --> 50:22.720
We see everything.

50:22.840 --> 50:24.480
Hmm?

50:24.600 --> 50:27.080
Personally,

50:27.200 --> 50:31.640
I really enjoyed your
performance in the shower.

50:31.760 --> 50:34.640
You know,
when I'm done with you,

50:34.760 --> 50:37.840
I think I'll go and
visit your girlfriend

50:37.960 --> 50:41.360
and see if she gives
me the same dedication.

50:46.400 --> 50:50.520
You know,
I can be very persuasive.

50:50.640 --> 50:54.000
Where is she?

50:54.120 --> 50:57.200
She's close.

50:57.320 --> 50:59.760
She's safe for now.

50:59.880 --> 51:03.400
I'm glad that you
enjoyed putting your dick

51:03.520 --> 51:09.120
in that sweet,
sweet little pussy.

51:10.360 --> 51:15.240
'Cause now I know
what part of your body

51:15.360 --> 51:18.360
you do not want to lose.

51:18.480 --> 51:21.640
Pull his pants down.

51:21.760 --> 51:24.080
No, no, no.

51:24.200 --> 51:25.760
No.

51:25.880 --> 51:28.400
That's enough.

51:28.520 --> 51:31.880
Traitor or not,
this is my project.

51:32.000 --> 51:35.640
I won't have you
slicing his manhood

51:35.760 --> 51:38.000
for your own amusement.

51:38.120 --> 51:39.400
It's a necessary evil.

51:39.520 --> 51:40.960
Is it?

51:41.080 --> 51:46.720
Believe me sir, I almost
had a confession from him.

51:46.840 --> 51:48.400
Confession?

51:48.520 --> 51:50.920
Someone on the inside
is working with him.

51:51.040 --> 51:53.480
I don't even think he knows who,

51:53.600 --> 51:56.360
but I will find the
mole in the records.

51:56.480 --> 52:00.600
Someone with access
ended his reconditioning

52:00.720 --> 52:02.120
before it finished.

52:02.240 --> 52:04.760
I trust you will
find this mole.

52:04.880 --> 52:07.760
Oh yes, sir, you
can be sure of that.

52:07.880 --> 52:09.680
I will get straight
into the records

52:09.800 --> 52:13.160
and I will find who
ended his reconditioning.

52:13.280 --> 52:17.880
We will know soon enough
who it is, but first,

52:18.000 --> 52:20.680
I am going to kill that traitor,

52:20.800 --> 52:25.480
as a lesson for the others.

52:28.200 --> 52:30.800
No.

52:30.920 --> 52:36.000
This is my project,
my subject.

52:36.120 --> 52:38.000
He will die by my hand.

52:38.120 --> 52:40.200
Yes, sir.

52:40.320 --> 52:43.400
You've seen better days,
my friend.

52:46.600 --> 52:50.240
Turn that off!

53:00.040 --> 53:01.920
[gunfire]

53:17.480 --> 53:18.800
I don't have time to explain.

53:18.920 --> 53:20.880
- We need to save Nina.
- Where is she?

53:21.000 --> 53:21.960
[screaming]

53:22.080 --> 53:23.840
Go!

53:23.960 --> 53:25.000
Nina?

53:25.120 --> 53:27.280
[groaning]

53:30.920 --> 53:33.040
Let's get outta here.

53:34.440 --> 53:36.440
I'm taking you
to the safe house.

53:36.560 --> 53:39.080
Trust me.

53:41.240 --> 53:43.600
[fireworks exploding]

53:43.720 --> 53:44.920
<i>[woman 2]
Our Director wishes you all</i>

53:45.040 --> 53:47.000
<i>a happy celebration
of Federation.</i>

53:47.120 --> 53:49.600
<i>Thank you for
your dedication to your State.</i>

53:49.720 --> 53:52.320
<i>May our Director live forever.</i>

54:02.600 --> 54:05.400
Pleasant trip?

54:05.520 --> 54:07.080
Come out when you're ready.

54:15.880 --> 54:17.720
What is this place?

54:17.840 --> 54:19.360
This is where it all happens.

54:19.480 --> 54:21.160
We're the resistance.

54:24.360 --> 54:25.840
We don't have much time.

54:25.960 --> 54:27.520
We need to do it
tonight to make it work.

54:27.640 --> 54:28.920
Make what work?

54:29.040 --> 54:29.800
Your mission.

54:29.920 --> 54:31.120
[Axon] What fucking mission?

54:31.240 --> 54:32.000
Freedom.

54:32.120 --> 54:33.160
What are you talking about?

54:33.280 --> 54:35.920
We need to take
out the Director.

54:36.040 --> 54:37.880
- What?
- Mm.

54:38.000 --> 54:39.280
That headquarters building

54:39.400 --> 54:40.560
is fortified like a bunker.

54:40.680 --> 54:42.240
You'd never get in,
and even if you did,

54:42.360 --> 54:44.240
it has like alarms and
codes that reset every hour.

54:44.360 --> 54:46.280
He's the most heavily
protected man in the country.

54:46.400 --> 54:47.520
Not tonight.

54:47.640 --> 54:48.640
[Axon] Every night.

54:48.760 --> 54:50.000
Not this one.

54:50.120 --> 54:51.400
Federation Day celebration,

54:51.520 --> 54:53.240
staff and guards
are at a minimum.

54:53.360 --> 54:54.720
It's the same every year.

54:54.840 --> 54:55.720
How many people?

54:55.840 --> 54:59.440
Outside of the Director, 10.

54:59.560 --> 55:02.280
How about the crowd?
He won't be with them?

55:02.400 --> 55:04.680
The Director's not really
the celebrating type.

55:04.800 --> 55:07.680
He likes to celebrate
in a different way.

55:07.800 --> 55:10.400
Show him.

55:10.520 --> 55:13.880
This is Koyoko Shima,
the daughter of Toshio Shima.

55:14.000 --> 55:15.920
After he had him assassinated,

55:16.040 --> 55:17.840
she's been with him ever since.

55:17.960 --> 55:19.200
Okay good, so she's an ally.

55:19.320 --> 55:23.120
No, she fell in love,
a classic Stockholm syndrome.

55:23.240 --> 55:25.000
Yes, she's fiercely loyal,

55:25.120 --> 55:28.280
but everyday Wednesday,
at 10:30 P.M. on the dot,

55:28.400 --> 55:29.480
she leaves the compound.

55:29.600 --> 55:31.400
The Director lets her
out to bring supplies

55:31.520 --> 55:33.120
to her relatives
down in Little Tokyo.

55:33.240 --> 55:35.320
That's where you come in.
If we can time it right,

55:35.440 --> 55:37.160
we can get you in.

55:41.880 --> 55:45.920
This is important, so pay
close attention to the layout.

55:47.840 --> 55:50.320
Security will be
minimal after 9:00 P.M.,

55:50.440 --> 55:52.280
the Director's mistress
will leave at 10:30,

55:52.400 --> 55:54.280
so he will be alone after that.

55:54.400 --> 55:57.080
This will be our only shot.

55:57.200 --> 55:59.720
When it's done,
meet us at the church.

55:59.840 --> 56:03.160
Here's his access
code to the chambers.

56:03.280 --> 56:05.760
Memorize it.

56:07.840 --> 56:10.600
Yes, but the access code
could change at any moment.

56:10.720 --> 56:14.320
You're right, it does,
except when Koyoko needs to

56:14.440 --> 56:16.600
enter and exit the perimeters.

56:16.720 --> 56:21.160
She's given a pass code that
works only until 10:40,

56:21.280 --> 56:24.360
which will give you 10
minute window to get in.

56:24.480 --> 56:26.040
Do you understand?

56:26.160 --> 56:28.520
No, listen, you might
think you are alone on this,

56:28.640 --> 56:30.080
but you're not.

56:30.200 --> 56:32.200
This is the beginning, Condor.

56:32.320 --> 56:33.920
The uprising is on.

56:34.040 --> 56:39.000
The Director has made a lot
of enemies over the years.

56:39.120 --> 56:40.880
He knows his time is limited.

56:41.000 --> 56:42.280
It makes him dangerous.

56:42.400 --> 56:47.160
I need you to
simply take him out.

56:47.280 --> 56:50.120
Simply?

56:50.240 --> 56:55.720
If, for some reason,
something happens to me,

56:55.840 --> 56:57.880
who will take care of Nina?

56:58.000 --> 57:00.800
I will, my word.

57:00.920 --> 57:02.600
Not that she needs it.

57:02.720 --> 57:06.680
Condor, we are counting on you.
You can do this.

57:06.800 --> 57:10.120
Car will be here in an hour
to take you to the drop zone.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.360
You two can use the
back room to get ready.

57:16.480 --> 57:19.800
Take your time,
get a little rest.

57:19.920 --> 57:23.080
It's going to be a long night.

57:23.200 --> 57:25.480
We're counting on you.

57:46.200 --> 57:48.800
You better make it.

57:51.480 --> 57:54.360
Just promise me you won't die.

57:55.720 --> 57:58.200
Okay,

57:59.600 --> 58:02.000
I promise you.

58:02.120 --> 58:06.320
You do this and
you come back to me,

58:06.440 --> 58:08.920
and we're gonna find our home,

58:09.040 --> 58:12.680
and we'll make
new memories, okay?

58:12.800 --> 58:14.960
Okay.

58:15.080 --> 58:18.280
<i>[man singing]</i>

58:19.760 --> 58:22.080
Just promise me that
you'll be careful.

58:22.200 --> 58:24.880
I will, just don't leave me.

59:00.560 --> 59:02.840
I don't want to leave you.

59:03.840 --> 59:07.120
I can look after myself.

59:07.240 --> 59:08.720
Just make sure you come back.

59:08.840 --> 59:11.400
Oh, I'm coming back,

59:12.680 --> 59:14.200
unless you truly believe

59:14.320 --> 59:19.080
that we can trust the
Controller to free these people.

59:21.280 --> 59:24.040
Don't trust anyone.

59:24.160 --> 59:25.960
I mean it,

59:26.080 --> 59:28.560
not anyone.

59:30.480 --> 59:32.520
Hey. The fuck you doin' in here?

59:32.640 --> 59:34.960
You two have plenty
of time for all that.

59:35.080 --> 59:36.200
Come on, we need to move out.

59:36.320 --> 59:40.240
Cronus you're
involved in this?

59:40.360 --> 59:43.640
This is for you, sir.

59:45.080 --> 59:47.960
Thank you.

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:19.120
So, learning and studying
acupuncture, herbology, massage;

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:22.640
every meridian in
your body is an organ.

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:24.200
Everything is corrected.

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:26.920
Everything is connected
to your nervous system.

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:29.800
Everything is connected
to your brain,

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:31.840
all of your vital organs,

01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:37.000
spine has all of the nerves
coming into all of the organs.

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:42.840
So we massage kidney, liver,
heart, spleen, everything.

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:45.480
This is what I need to teach you

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:49.640
so that you can
do the same to me.

01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:51.960
Do you understand?

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:57.920
[thunderclap]

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:03.760
Hey, Cronus, why you doing this?

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:05.320
Why you doing this?

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:09.200
Sir, this has become my duty.

01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:10.520
I've seen you be tortured,

01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:14.000
and I've seen you make
decisions for the good.

01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:17.480
But that's because
I have no choice.

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:18.640
You do.

01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:20.600
And I think about
every innocent life

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:22.720
that I've needlessly taken.

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:25.760
From now on, I'm in control.

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:40.120
[thunderclap]

01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:52.760
Where is she?

01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:57.400
Six minutes before
the lock changes.

01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:00.160
After that...

01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:02.800
Mission failed.

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:06.200
Here she comes

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:23.880
[silenced guns firing]

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000
I'm going in.

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:27.880
Take out the guard by the tower.

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:39.880
[groaning]

pulled the trigger.

for this moment

01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:56.760
for so long.

01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:00.560

I might give to him.</i>

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.240
It was easy.

01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:11.960

gonna go against the Director?

[Controller] That's what makes
this part of the plan genius.

Bringing you back to him
will give him hope and love.

And his love for you,
even if he has never actually

01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:32.240
seen you in real life,

01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:36.840
it will make him hate the
Director and the State

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:38.600
for taking you away from him.

01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:41.280

01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:58.280
When he sees you,
he will see his one true love.

01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:03.360
And he will go to
war to keep you safe.

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:07.280
That my dear

Once Condor kills the Director,

we will expose the rebels for
the dreamers they really are,

01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:40.279
and we will be

01:08:40.399 --> 01:08:45.479
