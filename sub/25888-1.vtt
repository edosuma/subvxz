00:29.464 --> 00:33.119
There once was a mouse,
happy as can be...

00:33.120 --> 00:37.645
who lives in a field right
under a tree.

00:37.646 --> 00:41.040
Without a care in the world,
he wasn't afraid.

00:41.041 --> 00:44.174
He played every day and
he slept in the shade.

00:46.394 --> 00:49.831
Then one morning the mouse
heard a loud cry...

00:49.832 --> 00:54.009
and a crow black as night
flew down from the sky.

00:54.010 --> 00:57.447
The crow lowered his beak and
tilted his head...

00:57.448 --> 01:00.973
then frightened the mouse
with the next thing he said.

01:04.150 --> 01:07.544
The Darkness hides in the light of day.

01:07.545 --> 01:11.722
Better run little mouse
before it comes out to play.

01:11.723 --> 01:16.249
Because the Darkness is evil
when it plays Hide and Seek.

01:16.250 --> 01:20.775
And it can go anywhere as it
sneaks and it peeks.

01:20.776 --> 01:24.387
The mouse took a few steps
and looked all around.

01:24.388 --> 01:28.826
He spun in a circle, and then
looked up and down.

01:28.827 --> 01:32.134
There's nothing dark here,
you crazy, old bird.

01:32.135 --> 01:36.660
The sun shines so brightly,
that's completely absurd.

01:36.661 --> 01:39.489
But the crow laughed out
loud and said...

01:39.490 --> 01:41.448
"you silly, little rat...

01:41.449 --> 01:44.016
"don't let the Darkness hear
you talking like that.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.848
Now there's one thing to do,
so listen to me.

01:50.849 --> 01:54.330
You must see it first,
if you wish to be free.

01:54.331 --> 01:57.594
Baby Zombie! She's gonna eat
you!

01:57.595 --> 02:01.381
Maddie! What did you do?
Look at your hands.

02:01.382 --> 02:03.905
Okay, no more markers for you.

02:03.906 --> 02:05.298
But I'm bored.

02:05.299 --> 02:06.777
Well, here, draw me a picture...

02:06.778 --> 02:08.431
while I finish packing the car,
okay?

02:08.431 --> 02:09.431
Okay.

02:23.317 --> 02:25.275
Last chance to say goodbye!

02:31.847 --> 02:33.543
Maddie, stay away from the
street, please!

02:33.544 --> 02:35.633
Okay, Mama.

02:42.249 --> 02:46.208
I'm sorry, this is the one day
this guy is in town, honey.

02:46.209 --> 02:48.515
Put it this way. You're gonna
have plenty of time to figure...

02:48.516 --> 02:49.820
out how to make it up to us...

02:49.821 --> 02:53.215
on the long lonely drive
by yourself.

02:53.216 --> 02:56.871
Daddy, look, it's me and Kayla.

02:56.872 --> 02:59.309
Wow. All right, come on, up.

03:02.921 --> 03:04.226
I can do it.

03:04.227 --> 03:07.447
Okay, put your seatbelt on.

03:07.448 --> 03:10.972
Thanks, Daddy.

03:10.973 --> 03:14.018
Don't be mad. I'm sorry.

03:14.019 --> 03:17.718
If you were really sorry,
you would've stuck to the plan.

03:17.719 --> 03:23.419
We'll still have a great time.
I'll just be a little late.

03:23.420 --> 03:24.986
And please call me when you
get there...

03:24.987 --> 03:26.509
so I know you got there okay.

03:26.510 --> 03:29.033
Don't be so dramatic. When will
you be leaving?

03:29.034 --> 03:32.733
This afternoon, so I'll be there
by midnight, at the latest.

03:32.734 --> 03:37.390
Okay. Maybe you could bring me
a midnight snack.

03:37.391 --> 03:38.479
Hmm...

03:41.525 --> 03:42.830
Say goodbye to Daddy.

03:42.831 --> 03:44.397
Bye, Daddy! Love you.

03:44.398 --> 03:46.312
Bye, I love you.

03:46.313 --> 03:47.791
Girl's night out.

03:47.792 --> 03:49.359
Have fun.

03:51.622 --> 03:53.101
I love you.

03:53.102 --> 03:56.060
Bye, Daddy, I love you.Bye.

05:47.825 --> 05:50.784
Okay, we're here.

05:50.785 --> 05:52.656
Finally.

05:53.918 --> 05:55.703
Are we there yet?

06:06.757 --> 06:08.280
Oh, come on.

06:30.085 --> 06:32.391
Who are you? I'm Owen.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.828
Uh, hi.

06:36.352 --> 06:39.268
Just gotta loosen up the
tumblers on the inside.

06:48.930 --> 06:50.670
Wow! Thank you.

06:50.671 --> 06:52.499
No problem.

06:54.196 --> 06:57.677
I'm what passes as local
security around here...

06:57.678 --> 06:59.243
probably because me and my
family are the only ones...

06:59.244 --> 07:00.941
that live here year round.

07:00.942 --> 07:02.856
Wish we could do more of that.

07:02.857 --> 07:04.728
What, living?

07:08.079 --> 07:11.038
There used to be two families
living out here.

07:11.039 --> 07:15.043
Other family lived right here
in your house, for years.

07:17.393 --> 07:18.741
'Til their boy went missing.

07:18.742 --> 07:20.134
Missing?

07:20.135 --> 07:23.267
Was about my age...
name was Johnny.

07:23.268 --> 07:27.271
Was kinda slow-witted, if you
get what I'm saying.

07:27.272 --> 07:28.882
They never found him?

07:28.883 --> 07:31.232
No. Family was really tore up.

07:31.233 --> 07:35.410
Put the house on the market and
never seen 'em again.

07:35.411 --> 07:40.197
Uh, well, I'm Laura and this is
Kayla and Maddie.

07:40.198 --> 07:41.548
Girls, say "hi".

07:43.419 --> 07:45.420
Nice to meet you, ladies.

07:45.421 --> 07:49.206
Don't see much of anybody out
here after season's over.

07:49.207 --> 07:51.121
Gets pretty lonely out here.

07:51.122 --> 07:52.775
Yeah, well, we thought we'd
squeeze in...

07:52.776 --> 07:54.037
at least one trip this year.

07:54.038 --> 07:55.561
Don't blame you.

07:55.562 --> 07:57.694
Well, I appreciate the help,
Owen, thank you.

08:01.219 --> 08:03.525
Just you girls and Mom this
weekend, huh?

08:03.526 --> 08:05.571
And Daddy.

08:05.572 --> 08:08.791
Yeah, he's... he's on his way.
He's right behind us, actually.

08:08.792 --> 08:11.664
Oh, well, that's good to know.

08:11.665 --> 08:14.362
Uh, well, tell Owen "thank you",
girls.

08:14.363 --> 08:16.233
Thank you.

08:16.234 --> 08:18.322
Any time.

08:19.760 --> 08:22.153
Thanks. Y'all take care now.

09:26.348 --> 09:28.132
Tag, I'm it.

09:35.836 --> 09:37.967
Girls, stay away from the water.

09:37.968 --> 09:40.231
Okay.Okay.

09:53.767 --> 09:55.985
You better be calling
from the road.

09:55.986 --> 09:59.510
Actually, I'm running a bit
late.

09:59.511 --> 10:00.860
Oh, you gotta be...

10:00.861 --> 10:03.776
Kidding. So you guys made
it okay?

10:03.777 --> 10:05.516
Yeah, we made it fine.

10:05.517 --> 10:08.563
Hey, girls, it's your dad,
he's on speaker.

10:08.564 --> 10:10.565
Hi, Daddy! Hi, Daddy!

10:10.566 --> 10:12.436
Hi, girls!

10:12.437 --> 10:13.786
Is the house still standing?

10:13.787 --> 10:15.135
Yeah.Yeah.

10:15.136 --> 10:16.527
Perfect.

10:16.528 --> 10:18.094
Daddy, when are you gonna be
here?

10:18.095 --> 10:20.531
Soon.

10:23.492 --> 10:25.494
Bye, Daddy! We love you!

10:27.670 --> 10:29.628
What's that noise?

10:29.629 --> 10:34.241
Uh, it's nothing. I actually
just stopped off to get gas.

10:34.242 --> 10:37.200
I should be there by 11:00.

10:37.201 --> 10:39.159
Okay, I might wait up.

10:39.160 --> 10:40.900
You better.

10:40.901 --> 10:43.032
We'll see. You could get lucky.

10:43.033 --> 10:44.686
I'm planning on it.

10:44.687 --> 10:48.037
Oh, hey... eggs. I forgot eggs.

10:48.038 --> 10:52.259
Eggs. Got it. I'll see you
in a bit.

10:52.260 --> 10:54.654
Drive safe, bye.

10:58.788 --> 11:04.140
Hi, uh, I'd like these gift
wrapped, please.

11:04.141 --> 11:07.362
And two bottles of your best
Merlot.

11:09.407 --> 11:10.887
So what'd you do?

11:13.803 --> 11:15.239
Nothing.

11:19.461 --> 11:21.636
Girls, I'm putting books and
toys in the playroom.

11:21.637 --> 11:23.594
No, the playroom is scary.

11:23.595 --> 11:25.379
No, it's not. Don't be a baby.

11:25.380 --> 11:27.163
I'm not a baby.

11:27.164 --> 11:29.253
Hey! I'm watching you.

12:35.929 --> 12:38.366
Maddie, ready?

12:40.542 --> 12:42.370
You look funny, Kay-Kay.

13:55.573 --> 13:57.924
What's that?

15:06.253 --> 15:07.776
Where does it go?

15:58.000 --> 15:59.610
Girls?

16:04.137 --> 16:05.660
Girls?

16:28.857 --> 16:30.640
I'm a grasshopper.

16:30.641 --> 16:32.991
Oh, really? But you're not
green.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.644
Do we have any green paint?

16:34.645 --> 16:36.169
No, only blue.

16:42.262 --> 16:44.828
Hey, Maddie! Get your shoes off
the bed, come on.

16:44.829 --> 16:46.743
All right, I left your pajamas
out, girls.

16:46.744 --> 16:49.064
Now why don't you get dressed
and get changed into them...

16:50.879 --> 16:53.055
and come on downstairs.

17:03.805 --> 17:05.675
Kayla, what is that?

17:05.675 --> 17:07.676
Nothing.

17:07.678 --> 17:09.592
I just saw you put something
in there. What is it?

17:09.593 --> 17:11.116
It's for Daddy.

17:11.117 --> 17:16.382
Well, let me see. Is it alive?

17:16.383 --> 17:17.905
No.

17:17.906 --> 17:19.602
It better not stink up the
house.

17:19.603 --> 17:22.040
It won't. It doesn't stink.
It smells good.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.867
Alright... well, get changed
and come on down.

17:23.867 --> 17:24.948
I'm gonna make some pizza.

17:41.364 --> 17:44.323
The mouse took a few
steps, and looked all around.

17:44.324 --> 17:47.500
He spun in a circle, then looked
up and down.

17:47.501 --> 17:50.851
There is nothing dark here,
you crazy, old bird.

17:50.852 --> 17:53.767
The sun shines so brightly,
that's completely absurd.

17:53.768 --> 17:58.554
But the crow laughed out loud
and said, you silly little rat..

17:58.555 --> 18:02.123
Don't let the Darkness hear you
talking like that.

18:02.124 --> 18:05.083
Now there's one thing to do,
so listen to me.

18:05.084 --> 18:08.303
You must see it first,
if you wish to be free.

18:08.304 --> 18:09.739
I know what it is.

18:09.740 --> 18:12.046
You do?

18:12.047 --> 18:14.440
I wanna go to bed, Mama.

18:14.441 --> 18:18.183
You do? The story's not over.

18:18.184 --> 18:21.186
You don't want to eat your
pizza?

18:21.187 --> 18:25.104
No? Okay. Go on up.

18:32.981 --> 18:36.636
I'll give you a hint, it hides
in plain sight.

18:36.637 --> 18:40.292
It lives in the dark even
when there is light.

18:40.293 --> 18:43.425
It walks close behind you and
watches you play.

18:43.426 --> 18:46.255
Floating beside you, from your
head to the hay.

18:48.518 --> 18:50.128
Maddie drew this, didn't she?

18:50.129 --> 18:52.434
No, that was already there.

18:52.435 --> 18:54.045
Oh, really?

18:59.355 --> 19:01.792
All right, Kay-Kay.

19:13.848 --> 19:16.720
Maddie, are you hot?

19:21.334 --> 19:25.903
Here. Yeah, that's better.

19:36.436 --> 19:39.090
Goodnight.

19:46.881 --> 19:49.623
Maddie, are you okay?

20:34.058 --> 20:35.625
What are you looking at?

20:52.338 --> 20:54.382
Hey, hi.

20:54.383 --> 20:56.428
Hey, is everybody alright?
I've been calling.

20:56.429 --> 20:59.257
Shit, I left the phone in the
car, I'm sorry.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.781
Okay. What y'all doin'?

21:01.782 --> 21:04.740
Nothing... uh, the girls played
while I unpacked...

21:04.741 --> 21:07.613
and we had some pizza,
now they're sleeping.

21:07.614 --> 21:09.745
What about you, where are you?

21:09.746 --> 21:13.445
Past halfway, so a few more
hours, I guess.

21:13.446 --> 21:16.970
Babe, you should see it,
the lake is just perfect.

21:16.971 --> 21:18.754
It's gorgeous out here.

21:18.755 --> 21:22.192
Uh, that's cool. So all you
wanted was eggs, right?

21:22.193 --> 21:24.673
Shawn, you're ruining it.

21:24.674 --> 21:27.633
I'm sorry, I thought you were
done. Please continue.

21:27.634 --> 21:29.288
It's, uh, really interesting.

21:30.898 --> 21:33.465
You're such an asshole.

21:33.466 --> 21:35.205
At least I remembered the eggs.

21:35.206 --> 21:36.990
Dude, you are so not romantic.

21:36.991 --> 21:38.905
I'll see you in a couple hours.

21:38.906 --> 21:40.820
Oh, hey, I left the gate open
for you.

21:40.821 --> 21:43.692
The pad lock's all jammed up.
I think we might need a new one.

21:43.693 --> 21:45.694
I'll take a look when I get
there.

21:45.695 --> 21:48.828
Okay. You hurry up, I love you.

21:48.829 --> 21:51.178
I love you t...

21:51.179 --> 21:53.181
Shawn?

22:56.070 --> 22:57.593
Mommy?

23:01.380 --> 23:03.077
Mommy?

23:08.474 --> 23:10.432
Mommy?

23:13.087 --> 23:16.046
Something's wrong with Maddie.

23:17.657 --> 23:19.353
What is it?

23:19.354 --> 23:22.226
She's in the playroom, but she
won't tell me.

23:26.187 --> 23:29.625
Maddie? Madison?

23:43.334 --> 23:45.032
Maddie?

23:52.343 --> 23:54.345
Maddie?

24:04.530 --> 24:09.056
Sweetie, hey, why is the
window open?

24:11.362 --> 24:12.886
Oh, it's okay.

24:16.803 --> 24:18.325
Mommy?

24:18.326 --> 24:21.416
It's okay, Kayla. She's just
sick.

24:24.027 --> 24:27.813
Here, you... there you go,
sweetie.

24:27.814 --> 24:29.684
Maddie, are you okay?

24:29.685 --> 24:31.077
Hm?

24:31.078 --> 24:33.688
Here, let me wipe that up.

24:33.689 --> 24:35.734
Mommy, is she okay?

24:35.735 --> 24:38.477
Yeah, she's fine, she's gonna be
fine. She's just sick, honey.

24:39.695 --> 24:41.653
Maddie?

24:41.654 --> 24:43.916
Maddie, hey, breathe, breathe,
let me see, what's in there?

24:43.917 --> 24:46.614
Get your hand out, come on,
let me see, Maddie.

24:46.615 --> 24:49.704
Come on. Maddie, let me see.
Let me see. Maddie?

24:49.705 --> 24:51.924
Okay, I got it. I got it. I got
it. Okay, breathe, breathe.

24:51.925 --> 24:55.667
Okay, all right, we got it, we
got it out. Are you okay?

24:55.668 --> 24:59.888
Take a deep breath. Deep breath,
deep breath, you okay?

24:59.889 --> 25:03.763
Mommy, what's that?

25:13.512 --> 25:16.775
What is this? Did you girls
eat something?

25:16.776 --> 25:20.169
I didn't.

25:20.170 --> 25:23.391
You stay with your sister.

26:07.870 --> 26:10.132
Maddie, look.

26:10.133 --> 26:11.657
A Tea Party!

26:30.937 --> 26:33.199
I saved mine for Daddy.

26:33.200 --> 26:34.070
Where'd you get this?

26:34.071 --> 26:36.725
In the forest.

26:45.255 --> 26:49.607
Maddie, look at me. Did you eat
one of these cupcakes?

26:49.608 --> 26:51.609
No.

26:51.610 --> 26:54.395
Yes, you did. She's lying.

26:56.527 --> 27:02.184
Okay. Maddie, honey... you're
not in trouble, okay?

27:02.185 --> 27:04.578
Mama just needs to know, did you
eat one of these cupcakes?

27:04.579 --> 27:07.321
Tell Mama.

27:10.498 --> 27:12.673
Okay.

27:12.674 --> 27:14.588
I'm sorry.

27:14.589 --> 27:16.156
It's okay, sweetie.

27:54.150 --> 27:59.241
What's wrong? What's wrong?!

28:10.601 --> 28:12.733
Mommy, what is that?

28:12.734 --> 28:14.301
I don't know.

28:25.791 --> 28:28.531
I'm scared.

28:28.532 --> 28:33.449
Honey, hey, here, here, sit on
the couch. It's okay.

28:33.450 --> 28:35.495
There, right by your sister,
right there. You okay, Maddie?

28:35.496 --> 28:37.932
Mama, my tummy hurts. I know, honey.

28:37.933 --> 28:40.413
Mamma? What's wrong with her?

28:40.414 --> 28:42.328
I don't know.

28:42.329 --> 28:45.244
Mommy! I need my phone.

28:45.245 --> 28:47.072
Don't leave. No, Mommy, please!

28:47.073 --> 28:48.813
I'm right here. Stay on the
couch, okay?

28:48.814 --> 28:50.894
I'm gonna be right in the
kitchen. Stay right there.

28:52.208 --> 28:53.688
Shit.

29:26.155 --> 29:27.939
No, don't go! No, turn that back on.

29:27.940 --> 29:29.942
Ssh! Quiet, quiet!

29:36.600 --> 29:38.254
I'm just gonna go to the car.

32:14.541 --> 32:16.194
Let's go, let's go.
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.

32:16.195 --> 32:18.457
No, Mama.No. No!

32:18.458 --> 32:19.980
Get up, come on, stop. Kay-Kay,
we gotta go, let's go right now.

32:19.981 --> 32:21.503
I don't wanna go outside.

32:21.504 --> 32:22.678
It's gonna be okay, but we have
to go right now.

32:22.679 --> 32:24.811
Carry me.

32:24.812 --> 32:26.813
I can't carry both of you, Kay
Kay. You're gonna have to run.

32:26.814 --> 32:29.120
No, Mommy! Please!!

32:29.121 --> 32:31.600
Listen, honey... hey, listen
to me...

32:31.601 --> 32:33.298
we have to get out of this house
right now, okay?

32:33.299 --> 32:35.126
Do you understand? I need you
to come with me, okay?

32:35.127 --> 32:36.518
I can't carry both of you.

32:36.519 --> 32:38.172
You're gonna have to run
right by me, okay?

32:38.173 --> 32:40.218
Mommy, you're scaring me.

32:40.219 --> 32:44.223
It's okay, I've got you,
I've got you right now, here.

32:46.486 --> 32:49.183
Okay.

32:49.184 --> 32:54.580
Quiet... be very quiet. Let's go.
Ssh, quiet.

32:56.104 --> 32:58.584
No, I'm scared! No, Mommy!

32:58.585 --> 33:01.414
Come on, Kayla, come on, come
on, let's go, let's go!

33:03.677 --> 33:06.766
Come on, now get in the back,
come on, come on, come on.

33:10.031 --> 33:16.559
Get in the car, go, go! Get in
the front, quick! Ready? Okay?

33:19.171 --> 33:20.451
Seatbelt on, quick, quick,
quick.

33:46.198 --> 33:47.502
Mommy!

33:47.503 --> 33:50.679
Come on, get the belt off!

33:50.680 --> 33:52.378
Mommy!

33:53.814 --> 33:56.903
Kayla.Mommy.

34:11.571 --> 34:13.440
Kayla, close the curtains
in there.

34:13.442 --> 34:15.270
Come on, quickly, hurry up.

34:17.402 --> 34:20.014
Sit down on the rug. Get down.

34:32.940 --> 34:35.899
Oh, Maddie, oh, Maddie.

34:39.641 --> 34:42.123
Oh, Maddie.

34:44.299 --> 34:46.431
Maddie, can you take a deep
breath for me?

34:52.481 --> 34:56.398
Let me see that you can swallow?
Just take a sip.

35:03.188 --> 35:04.405
I need to go get Maddie some
medicine, okay?

35:04.406 --> 35:06.799
No!

35:06.800 --> 35:11.978
Will you be brave while I go
and get some in the bathroom?

35:11.979 --> 35:15.025
Okay, good girl. I'm gonna be
right back.

35:56.763 --> 35:59.808
I don't feel good.

35:59.809 --> 36:04.205
It's okay. Mommy's getting you
some medicine.

36:22.615 --> 36:26.967
Drink this, Maddie, it's gonna
make you feel better.

36:29.578 --> 36:31.536
All of it, Maddie.

36:31.537 --> 36:34.104
It's gonna open your throat,
it's gonna help you breathe.

36:35.758 --> 36:38.065
Good girl.

36:39.501 --> 36:42.200
Where's Daddy?

36:45.115 --> 36:49.162
He's coming. He's gonna be here
real soon.

38:26.782 --> 38:30.786
Girls, go upstairs right now,
go, go, go, go!

38:49.065 --> 38:50.806
Kayla, hurry up, put your
shoes on.

38:56.377 --> 38:59.205
How did our picture get
out there?

38:59.206 --> 39:02.339
I don't know, baby.

39:02.340 --> 39:05.516
Did you put it...

39:05.517 --> 39:08.257
Why are our faces cut out?

39:08.258 --> 39:10.085
My tummy...

39:10.086 --> 39:13.306
I know, I know, it's okay,
it's gonna be okay.

39:13.307 --> 39:17.963
Daddy's gonna get here soon,
and when he gets here...

39:17.964 --> 39:19.921
he's gonna take us all
to the doctor...

39:19.922 --> 39:22.708
and the doctor's gonna get all
the bad stuff out of your...

39:23.709 --> 39:25.536
Oh, shit.

39:25.537 --> 39:27.538
I'm sorry...

39:27.539 --> 39:32.152
No, no, it's okay, it's okay.
It's not your fault.

39:34.067 --> 39:37.984
Open up, all the way, come on.
Open, open, open.

39:39.594 --> 39:40.943
Maddie, take a deep breath.

39:44.599 --> 39:46.383
We need to go right now
and get help.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.036
No, I don't want to leave.

39:48.037 --> 39:49.211
Kayla, I need you to be brave...

39:49.212 --> 39:50.865
No!

39:50.866 --> 39:53.215
Stop it, stop it, listen to me!
Look at me, look at me.

39:53.216 --> 39:54.782
Maddie's very sick. We can't
stay here.

39:54.783 --> 39:56.480
But you know what, we're gonna
go outside.

39:56.481 --> 39:58.307
We're gonna wait out there so
Daddy can see us...

39:58.308 --> 39:59.352
when he gets here.

39:59.353 --> 40:03.356
But he's already here.

40:03.357 --> 40:05.924
Who, Maddie?

40:05.925 --> 40:08.666
Dada...

40:08.667 --> 40:11.059
Where is he?

40:11.060 --> 40:12.932
Under the tree.

40:37.609 --> 40:40.176
Is that Daddy?

40:43.745 --> 40:45.964
No.

40:45.965 --> 40:47.619
Who did you see?

41:45.677 --> 41:46.895
Okay.

42:31.113 --> 42:32.679
Hello? Laura?

42:37.119 --> 42:38.468
What are you doing?

42:41.123 --> 42:42.211
Laura?

42:44.779 --> 42:46.738
Laura?

42:55.181 --> 42:57.444
Hey, you locked the gate.

44:18.133 --> 44:20.135
Goddamn it.

44:21.746 --> 44:26.358
Hey, guys, it's late.

44:26.359 --> 44:28.578
I've been driving all night.

44:31.451 --> 44:35.194
Can we just, uh, prank me
tomorrow?

44:42.157 --> 44:47.597
Okay, you got me. I'm totally
scared right now.

44:58.434 --> 45:02.699
Oh, shit... Laura, come on, god!

45:07.617 --> 45:09.488
Laura, what the hell?

45:09.489 --> 45:11.409
Laura, what the hell?

45:12.535 --> 45:15.189
Come on... Come on...

45:15.190 --> 45:17.758
What are you doing? What are you doing?

45:20.892 --> 45:23.851
Laura? Laura?

45:25.461 --> 45:27.681
Is that you? Is that you?

45:31.032 --> 45:32.730
Laura... Laura...

45:54.839 --> 45:56.754
Oh, shit.

46:09.462 --> 46:13.682
Breathe.

46:13.683 --> 46:19.514
It's okay. Breathe...
and we relax.

46:19.515 --> 46:21.734
That's good, see?

46:21.735 --> 46:24.084
Do you remember when Grandma
got sick...

46:24.085 --> 46:25.956
and we had to take her
to the doctor?

46:25.957 --> 46:27.827
Yeah.

46:27.828 --> 46:29.655
And remember how brave she was?

46:29.656 --> 46:31.526
Yeah, she didn't even cry.

46:31.527 --> 46:33.659
No, she didn't cry.

46:33.660 --> 46:39.796
She was so brave, and when we
got there everything was fine.

46:39.797 --> 46:42.799
Gave her medicine and she got
better?

46:42.800 --> 46:44.452
Yeah.

46:44.453 --> 46:46.846
When Daddy gets here, he'll take
you to the doctor.

46:46.847 --> 46:49.806
That's right, Kay-Kay. When
Daddy gets here.

46:49.807 --> 46:54.767
So until then, we all just need
to be really, really brave.

46:54.768 --> 46:56.421
Like Grandma?

46:56.422 --> 46:58.640
Yeah, just like her.

47:07.781 --> 47:09.000
What is that?

47:10.349 --> 47:12.481
Mommy. Shh, shh...

48:15.936 --> 48:17.242
Ssh!

48:34.912 --> 48:39.480
Laura? Kids?

48:39.481 --> 48:41.091
It's Daddy.

48:41.092 --> 48:43.310
Ssh, be quiet.

48:43.311 --> 48:45.834
Laura?

48:45.835 --> 48:51.710
Hey, guys, it's late, been
driving all night.

48:51.711 --> 48:54.670
Shawn?

48:58.370 --> 49:00.240
Shawn?

49:00.241 --> 49:04.810
Can you just... Laura?

49:04.811 --> 49:06.638
Stay back, it's all right.

49:06.639 --> 49:07.945
Laura...

49:13.428 --> 49:14.821
Shawn.

49:18.607 --> 49:20.827
Laura, what the...?

49:24.657 --> 49:27.399
It's me.

49:31.055 --> 49:32.665
Hello?

49:33.753 --> 49:36.668
Shawn, is that you?

49:36.669 --> 49:38.497
Is that you?

49:41.195 --> 49:46.243
Laura? Laura!

50:04.740 --> 50:07.004
Laura?

50:13.140 --> 50:14.533
Laura!

50:22.671 --> 50:24.978
Is that you?

50:28.590 --> 50:32.507
Laura.

51:17.813 --> 51:19.119
Please, no... Shawn...

51:25.212 --> 51:27.040
No!

51:37.181 --> 51:38.660
Girls, no!

51:40.836 --> 51:45.405
Daddy! Daddy! He's outside!

51:45.406 --> 51:47.451
It's not Daddy. Yes, it is!

51:47.452 --> 51:49.409
No, it's not. Daddy!

51:49.410 --> 51:51.455
No, it's not Daddy.

51:51.456 --> 51:53.239
Yes, it is. I heard him!

51:53.240 --> 51:55.676
No baby, it's a trick. It's a
bad man outside.

51:55.677 --> 51:57.809
Daddy... It's not Daddy!

51:57.810 --> 51:59.680
Daddy! No, Kayla, Kayla, stop it!

51:59.681 --> 52:03.641
He's gonna hear you. I need you
to be very quiet. Ssh.

52:03.642 --> 52:05.251
I need you to be very quiet,
both of you. Quiet, quiet...

52:05.252 --> 52:06.992
I want Daddy!

52:06.993 --> 52:09.256
Close your eyes. Close your
eyes.

52:16.655 --> 52:20.353
You are safe, okay?

52:20.354 --> 52:22.877
Nobody is going to hurt you.

52:22.878 --> 52:26.446
I will not let them.

52:26.447 --> 52:29.449
Do you believe me?

52:32.366 --> 52:34.194
Mama!

52:36.022 --> 52:37.414
Mama!

52:37.415 --> 52:42.115
Shh, shh, shh... quiet.
Come on, come on.

53:00.177 --> 53:02.701
Now stay right here, hold that.

53:13.494 --> 53:15.756
Maddie, can you run?

53:15.757 --> 53:17.367
I don't wanna go outside.

53:17.368 --> 53:19.412
Now listen to me. Listen, do you
remember what I said...

53:19.413 --> 53:20.674
nobody's going to hurt you,
okay? I won't let them.

53:20.675 --> 53:23.548
Okay, come on, hold on
to my jeans.

53:26.377 --> 53:29.944
Just stay as quiet as you can.
Walk this way.

53:52.359 --> 53:54.709
Kayla, let's go.

54:13.467 --> 54:17.949
Maddie, oh my god, come on,
shit!

54:17.950 --> 54:22.259
Come on, run fast, go, go, go!
Come on! Go, go, go!

54:37.404 --> 54:41.059
Are you okay? Are you okay?
Tell me!

54:41.060 --> 54:42.278
He's gonna get us!

54:42.279 --> 54:43.801
Don't make us go outside.

54:43.802 --> 54:45.019
No, we're not gonna go outside,
okay? I promise.

54:45.020 --> 54:46.195
Let's stay inside.

54:47.762 --> 54:49.373
Okay.

55:22.231 --> 55:27.498
Mommy... Mommy, he drew us.

55:37.899 --> 55:39.336
Mommy!

55:40.467 --> 55:45.646
Girls, go upstairs! Go, go, go!

55:51.086 --> 55:52.740
Go upstairs, now! Mama...

55:55.439 --> 55:57.049
No!

56:05.797 --> 56:08.190
It's okay. It's okay, sweetie.

56:23.945 --> 56:25.119
Mama?

56:25.120 --> 56:26.426
Ssh...

56:32.084 --> 56:33.563
Is he coming?

56:33.564 --> 56:35.348
Quiet.

56:38.177 --> 56:42.790
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

56:49.275 --> 56:52.277
We just have to wait
until morning...

56:52.278 --> 56:55.237
and everything's gonna
be alright.

56:58.458 --> 57:00.241
Mommy?

57:00.242 --> 57:03.289
No, Kayla, stay there.

57:14.474 --> 57:16.737
Hi, Mommy.

57:21.394 --> 57:23.875
Daddy will be here soon.

57:25.093 --> 57:26.877
I wanna go home.

57:26.878 --> 57:29.357
Me, too.

57:29.358 --> 57:31.752
It's okay, it's okay, we're
gonna go home soon.

57:34.929 --> 57:36.975
We're going home soon.

57:49.335 --> 57:50.597
What, Mommy?

57:54.253 --> 57:59.998
The eggs... the car, the car.

58:02.087 --> 58:04.088
No! No, no, Mama!

58:04.089 --> 58:06.133
It's okay, get in, get in,
get in.

58:06.134 --> 58:08.048
Just to go and get something. Don't leave.

58:08.049 --> 58:09.833
I'm not leaving. I'm just gonna
go downstairs.

58:09.834 --> 58:11.399
No, Mama.

58:11.400 --> 58:13.053
Come on, girls, it's okay,
hey, hey, hey.

58:13.054 --> 58:15.273
Kayla, let go, let go,
stop, stop.

58:15.274 --> 58:17.318
Please.

58:17.319 --> 58:21.366
Stop. Kayla, you're such
a big girl.

58:21.367 --> 58:24.674
You're so brave, both of you.
You're so, so brave.

58:24.675 --> 58:27.373
I promise you, I will be right
back, okay?

58:30.028 --> 58:34.161
Here, this lights up.

58:34.162 --> 58:38.252
Here, I want you to look
at this. You count along...

58:38.253 --> 58:42.953
with the second hand, one,
two, three...

58:42.954 --> 58:46.434
and I want you to count
to 20, okay?

58:46.435 --> 58:49.133
And I will be back before you
get to 20, and no matter what...

58:49.134 --> 58:54.007
do not come out of here until I
get back, okay?

58:54.008 --> 58:55.923
Start counting.

59:01.102 --> 59:04.236
One, two...

59:39.010 --> 59:43.144
12, 13...

59:53.198 --> 59:59.508
17, 18, 19, 20.

01:00:18.876 --> 01:00:21.138
We're gonna go to Daddy's car.
He's here?

01:00:21.139 --> 01:00:23.880
Yes. Hold my hand. Let's go.
Hold my hand.

01:00:31.453 --> 01:00:33.499
Get out of our house!

01:00:43.727 --> 01:00:46.033
I have a gun!

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:53.866
Get the fuck out of here!

01:01:13.147 --> 01:01:14.192
Hey.

01:01:20.154 --> 01:01:21.460
Up here!

01:01:23.854 --> 01:01:27.639
Hey! Get up!

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:33.079
Hey! Help, we're up here.
Up here. Yeah, up here.

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:34.908
Mom! Help, up here!

01:01:44.744 --> 01:01:46.006
Yes!

01:01:47.529 --> 01:01:51.750
Help! Up here! Help!

01:01:51.751 --> 01:01:52.795
Mama?

01:01:52.796 --> 01:01:58.410
No, stay back, stay back! Help!

01:02:03.458 --> 01:02:05.242
What are you saying?
I can't hear you.

01:02:05.243 --> 01:02:06.723
Help us.

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:10.160
Oh, god.

01:02:11.815 --> 01:02:15.339
No! No! Behind you! Behind you!

01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:16.906
What?

01:02:16.907 --> 01:02:18.169
No!

01:02:20.084 --> 01:02:23.130
Behind you!

01:02:58.426 --> 01:03:02.169
Come on down. Ssh.

01:04:28.516 --> 01:04:30.867
What is it?

01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:57.066
Kayla, Maddie, come on, we need
to go. Let's go.

01:04:57.067 --> 01:05:00.940
No! No! No, Mommy, no!

01:05:04.030 --> 01:05:09.427
No, Mommy, come back! Mommy! Mommy!

01:05:11.951 --> 01:05:13.735
Mommy!

01:05:41.285 --> 01:05:43.635
Mama! Ssh.

01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:15.232
I don't hear her. She's not
coming back.

01:06:26.112 --> 01:06:28.636
No, Kayla.Shh.

01:06:50.354 --> 01:06:52.399
Mommy?

01:06:53.531 --> 01:06:54.966
Mommy!

01:06:54.967 --> 01:06:56.707
Ssh... Maddie, be quiet.

01:06:56.708 --> 01:06:58.709
No, I want Mama!

01:06:58.710 --> 01:07:00.667
Ssh! He's gonna hear you.

01:07:00.668 --> 01:07:02.887
We have to get Daddy,
Maddie, come on.

01:07:02.888 --> 01:07:05.107
Maddie, come on.No.

01:07:12.767 --> 01:07:15.334
It's Daddy. Come on.

01:07:15.335 --> 01:07:16.857
Are you sure?

01:07:16.858 --> 01:07:18.207
Mommy said he's in the car.

01:07:18.208 --> 01:07:19.818
I'm scared.

01:07:22.429 --> 01:07:25.302
Here, you can hold it.

01:07:27.478 --> 01:07:29.828
Do you want me to go first?

01:07:32.004 --> 01:07:33.788
Okay.

01:08:12.305 --> 01:08:13.654
Do you hear that?

01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:30.932
Daddy!

01:08:41.551 --> 01:08:42.944
Daddy?

01:09:11.277 --> 01:09:13.540
Mommy! Mommy!

01:09:15.281 --> 01:09:16.804
Run!

01:09:21.461 --> 01:09:23.462
Run! Run!

01:10:04.983 --> 01:10:07.290
It's just a trick. It's not
Daddy. It's not Daddy.

01:10:09.770 --> 01:10:12.685
Maddie, run! Go, go, go!

01:10:12.686 --> 01:10:14.122
Mommy!

01:10:23.306 --> 01:10:24.567
Go, go!

01:12:14.025 --> 01:12:16.419
It's okay to be scared.

01:12:23.991 --> 01:12:27.343
My name is John.

01:12:29.345 --> 01:12:34.349
I grew up in this house
a long time ago.

01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:35.612
Momma...

01:12:40.312 --> 01:12:43.576
You come here every year.

01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:48.754
I've been watching you
for a long time.

01:12:48.755 --> 01:12:50.670
Leave us alone!

01:12:54.892 --> 01:12:59.591
I've always been here...
waiting...

01:12:59.592 --> 01:13:02.552
but you couldn't see me.

01:13:05.163 --> 01:13:10.254
That book, the one you read?

01:13:10.255 --> 01:13:13.084
It was given to me
when I was a boy.

01:13:14.781 --> 01:13:17.696
I used to try and guess
the answer...

01:13:17.697 --> 01:13:22.398
but I was wrong, just like you.

01:13:25.444 --> 01:13:29.752
I left it here so you
could find it...

01:13:29.753 --> 01:13:34.931
so you could understand.

01:13:34.932 --> 01:13:38.370
Now I have to make a new book.

01:13:41.286 --> 01:13:47.813
There's a darkness all around
you, but it's not a shadow...

01:13:47.814 --> 01:13:50.338
the darkness is me!

01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:55.778
No! No!

01:13:55.779 --> 01:13:59.564
Maddie! No! No!

01:13:59.565 --> 01:14:01.524
Maddie! No!

01:18:02.939 --> 01:18:05.681
Maddie? Maddie, wake up.

01:18:10.598 --> 01:18:12.252
Maddie...

01:21:37.327 --> 01:21:38.502
Agh!

01:22:05.790 --> 01:22:07.226
No.

01:22:40.390 --> 01:22:43.088
Maddie, Maddie...

01:22:54.186 --> 01:22:56.579
Mommy!

01:22:56.580 --> 01:22:59.278
Oh, my god.

01:23:00.758 --> 01:23:05.631
Mommy. My poor, little...

01:23:05.632 --> 01:23:11.594
Mommy. Mommy.

01:23:11.595 --> 01:23:14.250
Here we go. Come on, honey,
help me with her.

01:23:16.817 --> 01:23:19.036
Mommy... Come on.

01:23:19.037 --> 01:23:20.778
Help me.

01:23:25.609 --> 01:23:27.479
Time's up, little Mouse.

01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:29.394
The riddle is done.

01:23:29.395 --> 01:23:32.658
Can you see where it is
so you don't have to run?

01:23:32.659 --> 01:23:38.447
Because the Darkness,
it hides in the light of the day.

01:23:38.448 --> 01:23:41.277
And if you're not careful,
it will come out to play.

01:23:47.196 --> 01:23:51.503
Now if you're reading this story,
please don't be afraid.

01:23:51.504 --> 01:23:54.899
The Mouse guessed right
and the Crow flew away.

01:24:07.738 --> 01:24:09.521
So come little children...

01:24:09.522 --> 01:24:12.220
let's play a little game.

01:24:12.221 --> 01:24:16.051
Do you know where Darkness
hides on a bright sunny day?

01:24:31.283 --> 01:24:35.199
And just like the Mouse,
if you guess right, too...

01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:39.116
you don't have to worry
that it will come looking for you.

01:24:39.117 --> 01:24:42.686
Mommy... where did he go?
