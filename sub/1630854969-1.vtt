00:06.484 --> 00:09.052
Turner Hayes, voice-over:
After my parents were murdered,

00:09.052 --> 00:11.533
I was adopted by
the richest man in the city.

00:13.752 --> 00:17.930
He took me in.
Gave me everything I could want,

00:17.930 --> 00:20.455
except the reason why.

00:20.455 --> 00:24.328
In a city filled with orphans,
why me?

00:24.328 --> 00:27.897
Turns out that wasn't
the only secret he was keeping.

00:31.205 --> 00:34.251
He hid from the world
who he really was,

00:34.251 --> 00:35.470
behind the mask.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.653
Point.

00:44.653 --> 00:47.351
Turner, voice-over:
But then again, so did I.

00:47.351 --> 00:51.094
Pretending to fit into
a world I didn't belong.

00:51.094 --> 00:54.097
But it's only when you're
forced to take off the mask

00:54.097 --> 00:55.707
that you discover
who you really are.

00:57.231 --> 00:58.493
Just saying.
You could've
thrown the match

00:58.493 --> 01:00.147
and had the next
4 weekends off.

01:00.147 --> 01:02.540
Ha! Clearly, I did not
think this through.

01:02.540 --> 01:04.325
Should I ask Brody
for a do-over?

01:04.325 --> 01:05.804
Deny your dad
the chance to have

01:05.804 --> 01:08.329
another championship
fencer in the family?

01:08.329 --> 01:09.591
Hard nope.

01:09.591 --> 01:10.896
Where is he, anyway?

01:10.896 --> 01:12.333
He said he was
gonna be here.

01:12.333 --> 01:13.943
Guessing he had
to work late?

01:18.121 --> 01:21.342
Hey! Who's up for
a party at my house?

01:31.395 --> 01:32.440
Hey, guys.

01:37.749 --> 01:38.794
Oh!

01:40.012 --> 01:41.275
Uhh!

01:41.275 --> 01:43.103
Nice reflexes. Thanks.

01:44.843 --> 01:45.888
Carrie.

01:47.411 --> 01:48.630
We have trig together?

01:48.630 --> 01:49.718
Right.

01:51.198 --> 01:52.677
Sorry. I suck.

01:52.677 --> 01:54.244
Tell that to all
the people here

01:54.244 --> 01:55.898
to celebrate you
going to State.

01:55.898 --> 01:57.595
I don't know half
their names, either.

01:57.595 --> 01:59.597
Heh.

01:59.597 --> 02:02.731
Desecrating your
father's house, I see.

02:02.731 --> 02:05.429
Well, then,
carry on.

02:05.429 --> 02:07.692
Cressida, I'll make sure
this is all cleaned up.

02:07.692 --> 02:09.868
Oh, I haven't seen a thing.
Certainly haven't seen
the amorous couple

02:09.868 --> 02:12.044
making use of
the billiards room.

02:13.829 --> 02:16.048
Guys, come on.

02:16.048 --> 02:17.441
There are 30 other rooms

02:17.441 --> 02:18.703
in this place
to hook up,

02:18.703 --> 02:21.010
and that's
a 17th-century couch.

02:21.010 --> 02:23.708
Technically,
it's a canape.

02:23.708 --> 02:26.668
Stephanie?
Mom, I swear
we were just talking.

02:26.668 --> 02:28.278
Ha. Yeah.
Sorry, man.

02:28.278 --> 02:30.106
We'll, um,
find somewhere else

02:30.106 --> 02:31.455
to pick up
our conversation.

02:41.335 --> 02:43.772
Mm! Somebody broke into
the good stuff.

02:43.772 --> 02:46.992
Your dad gonna be OK with that?
I don't think
he'll miss it.

02:46.992 --> 02:49.212
As your best friend,
I'm telling you
he's not gonna

02:49.212 --> 02:51.823
miss the 90-decibel
fire code violation

02:51.823 --> 02:53.695
in this great room, either.

02:53.695 --> 02:55.871
I doubt he can hear it
from Wayne Tower.

03:07.230 --> 03:08.275
Hey.

03:18.546 --> 03:19.895
OK, they're blind.
We're clear.

03:22.506 --> 03:25.335
And next time, I'll
ride in the cart.

03:25.335 --> 03:27.337
Yeah, not gonna be
a next time,

03:27.337 --> 03:28.382
at least not with her.

03:33.125 --> 03:35.432
Look. Motion sensors
are toast.

Turner.

It's your father.

08:07.704 --> 08:09.576
I'm so sorry.
I don't even know
how to tell you this.

08:13.014 --> 08:14.058
He's dead.

08:24.895 --> 08:27.028
After what happened
to your parents,

08:27.028 --> 08:28.377
this...

08:38.039 --> 08:39.736
I am gonna find
who did this

08:39.736 --> 08:41.042
and I'm gonna
make them pay.

08:44.698 --> 08:46.569
That's what everybody
said back then.

08:55.883 --> 08:57.406
Turner, there are
gonna be some things

08:57.406 --> 09:00.104
coming out
about your dad,

09:00.104 --> 09:01.715
so I have to
ask you this.

09:03.978 --> 09:05.632
Did you know
he was Batman?

09:09.374 --> 09:10.506
Turner, voice-over:
He can't be Batman.

09:12.073 --> 09:14.075
If he was, where is it?

09:15.424 --> 09:19.080
Where's the bat suit?
Huh?

09:19.080 --> 09:20.211
He would've told me.

09:23.911 --> 09:25.695
Sometimes parents
keep secrets.

09:25.695 --> 09:27.741
I know my dad.

09:29.656 --> 09:31.135
And he
sure as hell was not

09:31.135 --> 09:33.007
sneaking out at night
fighting bad guys!

09:36.532 --> 09:38.099
He would've told me.

09:41.668 --> 09:43.321
It's gonna be OK.

09:51.678 --> 09:52.722
Do you hear that?

10:55.829 --> 10:56.917
My God.

11:06.622 --> 11:07.667
It's true.

11:25.946 --> 11:27.861
Thousands have lined the streets

11:27.861 --> 11:30.646
to honor the city's fallen hero
Bruce Wayne,

11:30.646 --> 11:33.910
who Gotham has now learned
was Batman.

11:33.910 --> 11:37.087
Wayne is survived by his son
Turner Hayes,

11:37.087 --> 11:39.960
who he adopted from
the slums of Burnside.

11:39.960 --> 11:44.573
Now twice orphaned,
Hayes joins a city in grief,

11:44.573 --> 11:47.445
one that is left to wonder
who will protect Gotham

11:47.445 --> 11:49.012
now that Batman is dead.

11:55.627 --> 11:58.761
Dent... got
an anonymous tip

11:58.761 --> 12:00.720
on where Wayne's killers
might be holed up.

12:02.286 --> 12:03.331
Good.

12:08.423 --> 12:11.252
Guys, th-this is
blood money.

12:11.252 --> 12:12.906
This is money that is
finally gonna get you

12:12.906 --> 12:15.778
and me outta Gotham,
and we didn't
kill anyone.

12:15.778 --> 12:18.999
An entire city thinks
that we killed Batman,
which is exactly what

12:18.999 --> 12:21.175
whoever set us up wanted.
I mean, why--why else
would they pay us

12:21.175 --> 12:23.003
all this money up front?
That's your complaint?

12:23.003 --> 12:25.657
Really, that I
didn't get them
on installment plan?

12:25.657 --> 12:27.224
You didn't even
get their name.

12:27.224 --> 12:29.226
Oh, well, what was I
supposed to do?

12:29.226 --> 12:31.228
Ask for an ID?
Maybe a gas bill,

12:31.228 --> 12:32.795
a canceled check?

12:32.795 --> 12:35.058
You see, in crime,
people who hire you

12:35.058 --> 12:36.625
to do something
illegal usually

12:36.625 --> 12:38.366
don't want it
traced back to them.

12:38.366 --> 12:40.237
Exactly, and now

12:40.237 --> 12:41.761
it only traces
back to us.

12:44.372 --> 12:45.460
Funeral's starting.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.245
Want to get
out of here now,

12:48.245 --> 12:49.333
now's our chance.

12:52.380 --> 12:54.904
For years, you knew Bruce Wayne

12:54.904 --> 12:58.038
as Gotham's most
prominent businessman,

12:58.038 --> 13:02.564
and now you know him
as the city's savior, Batman.

13:02.564 --> 13:07.047
But to me...
he was just my dad.

13:10.224 --> 13:12.095
He had an entire city to save.

13:16.752 --> 13:21.104
And yet, he insisted on
saving one more. Me.

13:21.104 --> 13:23.150
Freeze! Don't move!

13:26.327 --> 13:30.287
When my parents were killed,
he gave me a home.

13:30.287 --> 13:34.291
He took a scared, broken kid
from the worst part of Gotham

13:34.291 --> 13:36.337
and raised me as his own.

13:36.337 --> 13:38.861
An orphan himself,

13:38.861 --> 13:41.255
he was no stranger
to how dangerous

13:41.255 --> 13:43.518
and cruel the city can be.

13:43.518 --> 13:47.478
But instead of
retreating into despair,

13:47.478 --> 13:49.219
he became a force for justice.

13:52.005 --> 13:53.310
A beacon of hope...

13:54.921 --> 13:57.227
for all to look to
when hope seems lost.

13:57.227 --> 13:59.751
What he stood for

13:59.751 --> 14:01.841
will always live on.

14:04.844 --> 14:07.194
It was my father's belief
that each of us

14:07.194 --> 14:10.501
could become a light
strong enough to defy
the darkness.

14:35.352 --> 14:36.397
Turner.

14:38.268 --> 14:40.444
Just got word GCPD
apprehended the killers.

14:40.444 --> 14:43.404
They found them with
the money they were
paid for the murder.

14:43.404 --> 14:47.408
I know it's not gonna
bring your dad back,
but I thought

14:47.408 --> 14:50.890
you might find
a little solace
knowing that we got 'em.

14:53.196 --> 14:54.241
No.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.592
Not until I know
who put them up to it.

15:01.509 --> 15:02.553
Turner.

15:04.816 --> 15:07.210
We're gonna find
whoever it was.

15:07.210 --> 15:08.255
Are you sure?

15:09.517 --> 15:10.997
With no Batman,

15:10.997 --> 15:12.868
who's gonna solve
the murder of Bruce Wayne?

15:21.050 --> 15:23.531
Male reporter: The Mutant Gang
has claimed responsibility

15:23.531 --> 15:26.273
for the fires that have
engulfed the Narrows

15:26.273 --> 15:28.057
since the demise of
the Dark Knight,

15:28.057 --> 15:30.886
who we know now was
the late Bruce Wayne.

15:33.889 --> 15:35.630
I'm gonna go see Harvey,
see if he's made
any progress.

15:35.630 --> 15:37.806
I'm sure he will
keep you apprised.

15:37.806 --> 15:39.939
Maybe I can help him.
That might
prove difficult,

15:39.939 --> 15:42.158
since you'll be
in class.

15:42.158 --> 15:44.073
- Cressida--
- I will let slide
the occasional

15:44.073 --> 15:46.162
pillaging of
the wine cellar.

15:46.162 --> 15:50.036
Truancy is another
matter entirely.

15:50.036 --> 15:52.908
It's my job now
to protect you.

15:52.908 --> 15:54.954
Even from yourself.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.957
Your father had Alfred.
You have me.

15:59.654 --> 16:01.917
Only I'll try to be
a bit more fun.

16:04.485 --> 16:07.096
Born in Arkham Asylum.
In and out of juvie.

16:07.096 --> 16:09.229
Back in again.
Petty theft,

16:09.229 --> 16:13.146
grand larceny,
assault, assault...

16:13.146 --> 16:14.799
assault.

16:14.799 --> 16:16.845
And that's just
the stuff you know about.

16:18.673 --> 16:20.805
I would like to speak
with my legal counsel.

16:20.805 --> 16:22.590
Then you shouldn't have
shattered her kneecap.

16:22.590 --> 16:24.113
She shouldn't have tried
to get me to plead guilty

16:24.113 --> 16:25.854
to something I didn't do.

16:25.854 --> 16:28.248
Got your prints on
the gun that killed
Bruce Wayne,

16:28.248 --> 16:30.554
not to mention
the pile of money
we found you with.

16:30.554 --> 16:32.339
Who paid you?

16:32.339 --> 16:34.471
Cascimentos? The McKillens?
I don't know.

16:41.957 --> 16:43.089
Police found this
on you.

16:44.481 --> 16:46.005
So, is it true?

16:46.005 --> 16:49.095
Are you really
the Joker's daughter?

16:49.095 --> 16:51.227
Is that why
you murdered Batman?

16:51.227 --> 16:53.664
You're saying I did it
for the money,

16:53.664 --> 16:56.232
and then you're saying
I did it

16:56.232 --> 16:57.668
out of revenge.

16:57.668 --> 16:59.931
So, let me
get this straight.

16:59.931 --> 17:02.412
Somebody paid me
to do something

17:02.412 --> 17:04.066
that you say
I would have

17:04.066 --> 17:05.807
happily done for free?

17:05.807 --> 17:08.288
I mean, I'm not
a big, fancy lawyer.

17:08.288 --> 17:11.247
I'm just a girl with
two working kneecaps.

17:11.247 --> 17:12.901
But you two
might want to get

17:12.901 --> 17:14.337
your stories straight
before you

17:14.337 --> 17:15.773
take this to a judge.

17:32.181 --> 17:34.357
I'm not gonna ask you
how you're doing.

17:34.357 --> 17:36.316
Thanks.
I'm not gonna lie

17:36.316 --> 17:38.187
and tell you
I'm fine.

17:38.187 --> 17:40.059
Well, if you ever
want to talk or lie,

17:40.059 --> 17:42.104
I happen to be
a very good listener
either way.

17:42.104 --> 17:44.976
Hey. You doing OK?

17:44.976 --> 17:47.066
I'm fine.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.416
Steph told me how rough
it's been on you.

17:49.416 --> 17:50.895
Can't be easy.

17:50.895 --> 17:51.940
And now that
the whole world knows

17:51.940 --> 17:53.855
that your dad's Batman?

17:53.855 --> 17:55.944
I don't know how
you kept that secret
for this long.

17:55.944 --> 17:57.032
Brody.

17:58.468 --> 18:00.122
I didn't know.

18:00.122 --> 18:02.951
Oh, come on.
You had to have known.

18:02.951 --> 18:04.692
At least you
don't have to keep
the secret any longer.

18:04.692 --> 18:06.694
Must be a relief.

18:06.694 --> 18:08.826
Hey.

18:08.826 --> 18:13.092
Yeah. That's what
I'm feeling. Relief.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.571
Turner.

18:44.166 --> 18:45.820
Sorry Brody
was such a dick.

18:47.648 --> 18:49.389
He was right.

18:49.389 --> 18:52.392
The killers knew
he was Batman...

18:52.392 --> 18:55.395
which means they knew
my dad better than I did.

18:55.395 --> 18:58.049
I'm sure there's a reason
he didn't tell you.

18:59.442 --> 19:01.705
Yeah. Put it on
the list of things
I'll never know.

19:03.751 --> 19:06.710
Right next to
who had him killed.

19:06.710 --> 19:08.712
Give it time.

19:08.712 --> 19:11.715
The GCPD is
throwing everything
they have at this.

19:14.805 --> 19:16.242
There's one thing
they don't have.

19:20.246 --> 19:22.248
The Batcave.

19:22.248 --> 19:25.642
Do you have any idea
how powerful this thing is?

19:25.642 --> 19:27.166
No. Do you?

19:27.166 --> 19:30.343
Nope. And that's what
makes me nervous.

19:31.996 --> 19:33.998
And a little excited.

19:33.998 --> 19:35.391
You think you can
use it to hack into

19:35.391 --> 19:37.176
Gotham National Bank?

19:37.176 --> 19:39.482
Never hacked into anything
that secure before.

19:40.875 --> 19:42.181
But I've always
wanted to try.

19:46.968 --> 19:50.841
Harper Row,
straight "A"s,
honor roll,

19:50.841 --> 19:54.193
but 7 months
before graduation,
you drop out.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.282
Unlike you, I didn't
take AP Calculus,

19:56.282 --> 19:58.327
so maybe you can do
that math for me.

19:58.327 --> 20:01.112
It's not math.
It's history.

20:01.112 --> 20:02.766
Mom left.

20:02.766 --> 20:04.855
Dad couldn't beat
on her anymore,

20:04.855 --> 20:07.597
so he turned to
his kids.

20:07.597 --> 20:10.034
He didn't have a problem
with bisexual chicks
in his porn,

20:10.034 --> 20:13.473
but having one
under his roof
was another story.

20:13.473 --> 20:17.085
I had to get me
and my brother
out of there.

20:17.085 --> 20:19.043
Your brother?

20:19.043 --> 20:20.393
Cullen Row.

20:21.698 --> 20:23.657
Really?

20:23.657 --> 20:25.049
'Cause your
birth certificate
says you were--

20:25.049 --> 20:27.878
Hey, don't use
his dead name.

20:27.878 --> 20:30.533
Fine. I got another
dead name for him.

20:30.533 --> 20:31.621
Bruce Wayne!

20:31.621 --> 20:33.275
Ford.

20:33.275 --> 20:34.842
Take a walk.

20:42.676 --> 20:43.851
Sorry about that.

20:45.287 --> 20:46.723
From what your sister
told me, it sounds like

20:46.723 --> 20:49.073
you got enough of that
from your dad.

20:49.073 --> 20:52.033
Look, I--I know
what you're doing,
this building trust

20:52.033 --> 20:53.556
through performative allyship.

20:53.556 --> 20:56.255
Or maybe I'm just
not a dick.

20:58.300 --> 21:01.129
And maybe I know that
you are not a killer.

21:01.129 --> 21:04.263
No. Just desperate
for money.

21:04.263 --> 21:07.875
And then Duela just

21:07.875 --> 21:10.138
pirouettes her way
into Union Street
soup kitchen

21:10.138 --> 21:11.966
with a plan,
a one-time robbery.

21:11.966 --> 21:13.707
And you didn't know
that the thing she really

21:13.707 --> 21:16.362
wanted to take was
Bruce Wayne's life?

21:16.362 --> 21:18.538
No, I--
I can make
a jury believe that.

21:18.538 --> 21:20.061
But that--you can't
make me believe that

21:20.061 --> 21:21.758
because it's not
what happened.

21:21.758 --> 21:23.456
You're just trying
to turn us against
each other.

21:23.456 --> 21:25.501
I'm just trying
to get the truth.

21:25.501 --> 21:27.155
It was me.

21:27.155 --> 21:29.157
I'm the one who
killed Bruce Wayne.

21:29.157 --> 21:31.638
I'll sign whatever
confession you want,

21:31.638 --> 21:33.814
but my brother walks.

21:33.814 --> 21:35.990
Who paid you the money?

21:38.775 --> 21:40.777
I don't know.

21:43.345 --> 21:44.999
Then we don't have a deal.

21:52.876 --> 21:57.054
All we know is that
the killers were paid
a hundred grand in cash.

21:57.054 --> 21:59.056
Let me see if I can
run a search

21:59.056 --> 22:03.017
for cash withdrawals.

22:03.017 --> 22:04.279
Oh.

22:04.279 --> 22:06.455
Yes, I can.

22:06.455 --> 22:08.892
You get into Gotham
National Bank?

22:08.892 --> 22:11.460
I'm in all the banks.

22:11.460 --> 22:13.767
At the same time.

22:13.767 --> 22:16.030
Offshore accounts,

22:16.030 --> 22:18.032
slush funds,

22:18.032 --> 22:20.121
shell corporations.

22:21.731 --> 22:24.343
I could do some damage
with this thing.

22:34.744 --> 22:36.398
Just get me the name
of who paid them.

22:37.834 --> 22:38.966
I'll do the rest.

22:38.966 --> 22:41.621
No.

22:41.621 --> 22:44.841
Whatever we find, we're
turning over to the police.

22:44.841 --> 22:47.061
I'm not helping you
become some vigilante.

22:50.412 --> 22:52.719
That a match?

22:52.719 --> 22:54.982
17 withdrawals over 4 days.

22:54.982 --> 22:57.593
Same account.

22:57.593 --> 23:00.291
Exact amount paid
to the killers.

23:00.291 --> 23:02.119
Whose account is it?

23:05.122 --> 23:06.341
Yours.

23:06.341 --> 23:07.777
What?

23:07.777 --> 23:09.823
This makes it
look like the person

23:09.823 --> 23:11.955
who paid to have
your dad killed is you.

23:11.955 --> 23:13.479
That doesn't make
any sense.

23:15.132 --> 23:17.570
We better call the police
before the bank does.

23:17.570 --> 23:20.399
Think they already did.

23:23.184 --> 23:27.101
Police officer:
Turner Hayes, you have
the right to remain silent.

23:27.101 --> 23:29.451
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

23:29.451 --> 23:31.148
in a court of law.

23:46.120 --> 23:47.600
Gotham is in shock today

23:47.600 --> 23:49.950
over the arrest of
Bruce Wayne's adopted son

23:49.950 --> 23:51.865
Turner Hayes,
who is suspected

23:51.865 --> 23:53.823
of masterminding
the billionaire's murder.

23:55.999 --> 23:57.914
Get him out
of those handcuffs.

23:57.914 --> 24:00.221
Harvey, I didn't do this.

24:00.221 --> 24:03.442
Hey, you listen to me.
You do not talk to anyone

24:03.442 --> 24:06.096
until your dad's lawyers
get here, you understand me?

24:07.620 --> 24:09.273
Listen,
I know Turner.

24:09.273 --> 24:10.927
Serial numbers on
the bills from his account

24:10.927 --> 24:12.320
match the ones the
suspects were found with.

24:12.320 --> 24:14.061
It just--it doesn't
make any sense.

24:14.061 --> 24:15.541
Biological parents
were murdered,
killer never found.

24:15.541 --> 24:17.107
Oh, come on.
He was just a kid.

24:17.107 --> 24:18.631
Now his adoptive
father's gunned down.

24:18.631 --> 24:20.328
Once is a tragedy,
twice is a pattern.

24:20.328 --> 24:21.460
Then what's the motive?

24:21.460 --> 24:23.113
Motive?

24:23.113 --> 24:24.680
3 days before he
was murdered,

24:24.680 --> 24:26.160
Bruce Wayne made
an appointment to alter

24:26.160 --> 24:27.596
his last will
and testament.

24:27.596 --> 24:30.469
Wanted to change
the beneficiary.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.514
Sounds like a hell
of a motive to me.

24:34.908 --> 24:38.215
They think I
killed my dad because
I wanted his money?

24:38.215 --> 24:41.305
Look, you're
the sole beneficiary.

24:41.305 --> 24:42.655
They could argue that
Bruce was planning

24:42.655 --> 24:44.700
to cut you out
of his will.

24:44.700 --> 24:47.529
You mean you could
argue that.

24:47.529 --> 24:49.836
You're the DA, right?

24:49.836 --> 24:52.142
And you told me not
to say anything
without an attorney.

24:52.142 --> 24:55.711
Turner, I talked
to Cressida.

24:55.711 --> 24:58.845
Your dad's law firm is
refusing to represent you.

25:00.281 --> 25:01.935
Everyone thinks I did it.

25:01.935 --> 25:03.545
No. I don't.

25:07.418 --> 25:12.119
But I am having a hard time
making a case for who did.

25:12.119 --> 25:15.731
The night he was killed,
this was found on your father.

25:15.731 --> 25:19.213
Apparently it's
a sixth-century
Athenian coin.

25:19.213 --> 25:23.043
Does it mean anything
to you, anything at all?

25:23.043 --> 25:27.569
No, but there's
a lot of things my dad
didn't tell me about.

25:29.658 --> 25:31.834
On your feet.

25:36.709 --> 25:37.971
Hey.

25:37.971 --> 25:40.060
I've got you.

25:51.288 --> 25:53.769
Oh, look.

25:53.769 --> 25:55.902
It's the bat brat.

25:58.252 --> 26:01.168
I bet you thought it
would be easy to frame me

26:01.168 --> 26:04.040
since...

26:04.040 --> 26:07.174
you know, your pops
killed mine.

26:07.174 --> 26:08.871
Little history, though.

26:08.871 --> 26:11.439
Papa J. ditched
me and my mom in Arkham

26:11.439 --> 26:14.703
before my first
tooth came in,

26:14.703 --> 26:17.401
when he started banging
this little--

26:17.401 --> 26:21.841
this little size-two,
get out of jail free
card named Harley Quinn.

26:21.841 --> 26:25.584
So I would sooner
send your dad
a thank-you note

26:25.584 --> 26:28.282
than send him
flying out a window,

26:28.282 --> 26:30.110
because...

26:32.068 --> 26:33.417
I hate my dad.

26:35.332 --> 26:38.945
But I guess we have
that in common now,
don't we?

26:41.687 --> 26:43.166
What's the matter?

26:43.166 --> 26:46.082
What, you don't talk
to the hired help?

26:46.082 --> 26:49.085
I did not pay you
to kill my dad.

26:49.085 --> 26:52.262
No, you just paid us to
take the fall for it.

26:52.262 --> 26:54.613
You don't know
how lucky you are.

26:54.613 --> 26:57.093
To actually have a dad
who cared about you?

26:57.093 --> 27:00.880
And you had him killed to,
what, speed up that little
inheritance of yours?

27:00.880 --> 27:03.534
You don't
know anything about me.
Get away from him!

27:03.534 --> 27:05.972
Harper, Harper,
I don't need you fighting
my battles for me, all right?

27:05.972 --> 27:07.974
I'm not.
Then why'd you try
and cut a deal to save me?

27:07.974 --> 27:10.585
Hey! What deal? What?
You're gonna say I
pulled the trigger?

27:10.585 --> 27:14.371
She didn't have to!
Your prints are all
over the damn gun!

27:20.987 --> 27:23.598
Let... go of me!
Oh!

27:23.598 --> 27:25.513
Break it up!

27:25.513 --> 27:27.428
Settle down!

27:32.607 --> 27:34.304
Ahh!

27:34.304 --> 27:37.177
Get these animals
cuffed and stuffed!

27:37.177 --> 27:39.658
I'd like my one
phone call now, please.

27:41.181 --> 27:43.966
Mr. Dent,
did Batman's son

27:43.966 --> 27:45.968
really hire
the Joker's daughter?

27:45.968 --> 27:47.840
It's an ongoing investigation.

27:47.840 --> 27:51.321
I would advise the public
not to rush to judgment.

27:51.321 --> 27:53.019
You're a friend of
the Wayne family.

27:53.019 --> 27:55.717
Will you be recusing
yourself from this case?

27:59.503 --> 28:01.201
That's a fair question.

28:01.201 --> 28:02.681
You want an answer?

28:02.681 --> 28:04.508
I don't think
I need one.

28:04.508 --> 28:05.945
City's already
convicted the kid.

28:05.945 --> 28:08.121
You just need
to make it official.

28:08.121 --> 28:10.776
I'm practically his uncle.

28:10.776 --> 28:13.996
Not sure that's
the campaign slogan I
would have picked for you.

28:13.996 --> 28:17.347
It's no secret you have
your eye on the mayor's
office, Harvey.

28:17.347 --> 28:19.654
And what better way to
announce your candidacy

28:19.654 --> 28:21.700
than after putting away
an ungrateful

28:21.700 --> 28:24.659
adopted son who bit
the hand that feeds?

28:26.052 --> 28:29.011
Or your campaign
can down in flames

28:29.011 --> 28:31.013
when the voters believe
that despite

28:31.013 --> 28:33.146
a preponderance
of evidence,

28:33.146 --> 28:35.670
you gave Turner Hayes
preferential treatment

28:35.670 --> 28:37.237
because he's family.

28:42.633 --> 28:44.897
Shouldn't you be using

28:44.897 --> 28:47.073
your one phone call to talk
to a lawyer or somebody?

28:47.073 --> 28:49.031
Right now I just
want to talk

28:49.031 --> 28:50.685
to someone
who believes me.

28:50.685 --> 28:52.643
Of course I do.

28:54.254 --> 28:56.256
You always could see
past the obvious.

28:58.693 --> 29:03.654
When everyone acted
like I hit the
adoption lottery...

29:03.654 --> 29:07.963
you saw that
for Bruce Wayne
to become my dad,

29:07.963 --> 29:10.574
I had to lose
two parents first.

29:12.925 --> 29:15.579
You got me
through that.

29:15.579 --> 29:17.886
Now I need you
to do it again.

29:17.886 --> 29:20.062
Anything.

29:20.062 --> 29:23.065
You found that smoking gun
with the money.

29:23.065 --> 29:25.764
Now I need you to find out
who put it there.

29:27.156 --> 29:28.984
No pressure, right?

29:28.984 --> 29:30.856
Time's up, Hayes.

29:33.902 --> 29:36.687
You're the only one
who can get me out
of this, Steph.

29:59.058 --> 30:02.017
I just want to say,
great job back there.

30:02.017 --> 30:04.106
With the fight.

30:04.106 --> 30:06.761
You made it look
so convincing.

30:06.761 --> 30:10.765
- That was supposed to be fake?
- Well, the punches
were real enough.

30:10.765 --> 30:12.288
And much of the feelings
behind them.

30:12.288 --> 30:14.464
But we had to lure
the cops in somehow.

30:14.464 --> 30:15.988
How else could we get
our hands on a few

30:15.988 --> 30:17.816
of their little trinkets

30:17.816 --> 30:20.383
that we can use to get
out of these cop locks?

30:25.127 --> 30:28.478
We all may hate
each other, but we hate
being dead even more.

30:28.478 --> 30:30.524
What are you
talking about?

30:30.524 --> 30:32.308
What, you haven't
figured it out yet?

30:32.308 --> 30:34.833
We didn't kill your dad
any more than you did.

30:34.833 --> 30:37.487
5 minutes in a cell
with you, and we knew you
didn't have the brains

30:37.487 --> 30:40.534
to be the brains
behind this frame job.
But whoever is behind it

30:40.534 --> 30:43.102
is gonna make sure we have
a little accident
inside Blackgate.

30:43.102 --> 30:46.409
Because the only way
the setup works is if
we all end up dead.

30:46.409 --> 30:49.238
Unless you want to join us
in getting out of here.

30:57.986 --> 31:00.032
All aboard
the Blackgate Express.

31:01.685 --> 31:04.253
Let's go!

31:12.653 --> 31:14.742
Time to pick a side.

31:33.979 --> 31:35.328
What?

31:38.418 --> 31:40.811
What the hell are you doing?

31:40.811 --> 31:43.727
Well, I'm trying
to get these stupid
handcuffs undone

31:43.727 --> 31:45.904
with this damn pin,
and it's not working.

31:47.296 --> 31:48.515
Cullen and Harper
had no problem

31:48.515 --> 31:49.516
getting theirs off.

31:49.516 --> 31:50.691
What?

31:50.691 --> 31:52.171
Aah!

31:56.697 --> 31:57.916
Aah!

32:15.455 --> 32:17.500
What's it gonna be,
bat brat?

32:19.589 --> 32:21.461
Uhh!

32:33.821 --> 32:36.432
Aah!

32:50.098 --> 32:51.839
Hang on to something!

33:08.160 --> 33:09.683
Come out with
your hands up.

33:16.646 --> 33:20.999
Don't shoot.

33:20.999 --> 33:23.131
Got my gun.

33:23.131 --> 33:25.699
And if you all
don't back off,

33:25.699 --> 33:28.658
I am gonna give him
back the bullets!

33:28.658 --> 33:31.618
You're surrounded.
We will fire.

33:31.618 --> 33:34.186
Oh, what a coincidence!
So will I!

33:36.101 --> 33:37.450
No!

33:37.450 --> 33:39.756
What are you doing?

33:39.756 --> 33:41.802
What my father
would want.

33:43.456 --> 33:44.892
We can't prove
we're not killers

33:44.892 --> 33:46.024
by killing someone.

33:49.592 --> 33:53.031
They don't care
if we're innocent.

33:59.472 --> 34:01.735
She's right, you know.

34:01.735 --> 34:03.345
What?

34:03.345 --> 34:05.086
He's in on it.

34:06.566 --> 34:08.176
They all are.

34:15.096 --> 34:17.664
Your little attempt
at escape

34:17.664 --> 34:20.710
just made my job
a little easier.

34:20.710 --> 34:23.583
I hope Daddy's
proud of you,

34:23.583 --> 34:25.933
'cause you're about
to join him.

34:28.718 --> 34:30.416
No hard feelings, kid.

34:39.816 --> 34:41.644
Oh!

35:14.024 --> 35:16.288
Aah!

35:16.288 --> 35:17.854
Who the hell are you?

35:20.770 --> 35:22.076
I'm Robin.

35:25.514 --> 35:27.734
Wait, I know you.

35:27.734 --> 35:29.170
Carrie Kelley.

35:29.170 --> 35:30.476
From trig!

35:31.738 --> 35:34.262
We have to go, now.

35:34.262 --> 35:36.351
T-t-tell me you brought
the Batmobile.

35:36.351 --> 35:37.961
No.

35:37.961 --> 35:39.354
My mom's car.

35:40.921 --> 35:43.532
Gonna be
a tight squeeze.

35:43.532 --> 35:44.881
Uh, excuse me.

35:47.536 --> 35:49.277
I am not going
anywhere with him.

35:49.277 --> 35:51.018
We have to stick together

35:51.018 --> 35:52.585
or they'll pick us
off one by one.

35:52.585 --> 35:54.108
You almost just
got us killed.

35:54.108 --> 35:56.241
I know.
I'm sorry.

35:58.243 --> 35:59.853
Apology accepted.

36:01.811 --> 36:04.162
Ooh! I call shotgun!

36:19.307 --> 36:21.527
How did you know
it wasn't us?

36:23.442 --> 36:25.357
When you work with the
world's greatest detective,

36:25.357 --> 36:27.576
you pick up a few things.

36:30.362 --> 36:32.538
So you knew my dad
was Batman?

36:34.453 --> 36:37.325
He didn't exactly tell me.

36:37.325 --> 36:40.285
I just kind of found out.

36:40.285 --> 36:42.852
Mutant gang threw him
off the roof
of my apartment.

36:42.852 --> 36:44.941
I dragged him to safety.

36:44.941 --> 36:46.900
Not a bad way
to meet your hero.

36:46.900 --> 36:50.033
After that, I became
his eyes and ears.

36:50.033 --> 36:51.731
He even gave me these.

36:54.081 --> 36:56.388
Called me his
little robin.

36:58.303 --> 37:00.696
You knew my dad in a way
I never will.

37:00.696 --> 37:02.698
I knew him well enough
to know that you were

37:02.698 --> 37:04.744
the thing he loved
most in this world.

37:06.702 --> 37:09.401
Not enough to tell me
who he really was.

37:10.924 --> 37:14.841
Turner, he didn't
want you to follow
down that path.

37:14.841 --> 37:17.757
You both lost so much.

37:17.757 --> 37:19.759
He was so impressed
that you never gave in

37:19.759 --> 37:21.935
to the darkness
like he did.

37:23.458 --> 37:26.766
Your father may have
been a hero to
all of Gotham...

37:29.290 --> 37:31.597
but he always used
to tell me that
his hero was you.

37:40.606 --> 37:42.608
Look, unless
we all want to be
buried next to him,

37:42.608 --> 37:44.784
we might want to get
the hell out of here.

37:48.962 --> 37:50.790
In the wake
of the violent escape

37:50.790 --> 37:54.750
from a GCPD convoy
earlier tonight,

37:54.750 --> 37:57.536
I want to assure
the citizens of Gotham

37:57.536 --> 38:01.279
that we are marshalling
all of the city's resources

38:01.279 --> 38:04.760
to hunt down
these fugitives--

38:04.760 --> 38:08.329
Harper and Cullen Row,

38:08.329 --> 38:11.245
the Joker's daughter...

38:11.245 --> 38:14.857
and Bruce Wayne's own son,

38:14.857 --> 38:16.337
Turner Hayes...

38:17.860 --> 38:21.386
as well as anyone
who aids or abets them.

38:31.265 --> 38:33.528
They'll be looking
for us everywhere,

38:33.528 --> 38:36.444
so we stick to
the high ground.

38:36.444 --> 38:38.446
Nobody really knows
about this place.

38:38.446 --> 38:40.840
So what's the plan?

38:40.840 --> 38:42.842
We hide up here
till they hunt us down?

38:42.842 --> 38:45.453
We're gonna find who
really killed my dad

38:45.453 --> 38:47.150
and clear our names.

38:47.150 --> 38:49.239
Look around.

38:49.239 --> 38:51.546
A bunch of thieves
turned fugitives,

38:51.546 --> 38:53.113
Joker's delusional daughter,

38:53.113 --> 38:56.812
a sidekick,
Batman's orphan.

38:56.812 --> 38:59.467
We're a lot of things,
but we're not cops.

38:59.467 --> 39:01.426
Neither was my dad.

39:01.426 --> 39:03.341
Didn't stop him from
taking down criminals.

39:03.341 --> 39:05.604
Hey.
Over here,
in the back.

39:05.604 --> 39:07.562
I'm pretty sure the guy
who killed your dad
was that detective

39:07.562 --> 39:09.738
who tried to do the same to us.
No.

39:09.738 --> 39:12.262
I checked.
Ford was accounted for

39:12.262 --> 39:15.004
at the time of the murder,
which means he was just
a part of the coverup.

39:15.004 --> 39:17.224
And he must have been
paid a lot to do it.

39:19.052 --> 39:21.315
I swiped this from Ford
during our escape.

39:21.315 --> 39:24.840
He owns a pretty nice watch,
even on a dirty cop's salary.

39:24.840 --> 39:27.365
Figured we can fence it.

39:27.365 --> 39:29.018
The engraving on
the back's

39:29.018 --> 39:31.020
definitely gonna ding
the street value.

39:31.020 --> 39:33.109
Let me see.

39:36.548 --> 39:39.681
We should have just
let him kill us,

39:39.681 --> 39:41.379
'cause we're already dead.

39:43.555 --> 39:44.904
Wait, what is that?

39:46.732 --> 39:49.299
It was on a coin
my dad had.

39:51.998 --> 39:54.217
It's the symbol of
the Court of Owls.

39:55.958 --> 39:58.265
They're the ones who
really run this city.

40:00.963 --> 40:03.226
No one knows
who they are,

40:03.226 --> 40:07.230
and you don't dare ask,
because if you find out...

40:07.230 --> 40:10.364
it'll be the last thing
you ever see.

40:12.975 --> 40:14.716
How do you know
all this?

40:14.716 --> 40:19.199
Because while you were
being read bedtime stories,

40:19.199 --> 40:23.203
I was listening to the
warnings that echo through
the halls of Arkham.

40:28.774 --> 40:31.646
"Beware of the Court of Owls

40:31.646 --> 40:33.909
"that watches all the time,

40:33.909 --> 40:37.260
"ruling Gotham from
a shadowed perch

40:37.260 --> 40:40.263
behind granite and lime."

40:42.048 --> 40:44.442
"They watch you
at your hearth."

40:47.793 --> 40:50.404
"They watch you in your bed."

40:54.060 --> 40:56.802
"Speak not a whispered
word of them..."

41:01.110 --> 41:02.938
Uh... no!

41:06.812 --> 41:09.162
"Or they'll send
the Talon for your head."

41:38.191 --> 41:40.236
Greg, move your head!
