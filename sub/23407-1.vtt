WEBVTT

00:04.117 --> 00:06.452
- This nice, ain't it?
- Yes.

00:06.539 --> 00:08.703
The whole family back together again.

00:08.786 --> 00:10.335
Yeah.

00:10.647 --> 00:14.046
I wish we left a few
of them back at the house.

00:14.117 --> 00:15.884
Uh, you did.

00:15.885 --> 00:17.219
Who we leave?

00:17.220 --> 00:18.453
Our twins. Hello?

00:18.454 --> 00:19.821
Oh, please.

00:19.822 --> 00:21.624
They need too many bathroom breaks.

00:23.387 --> 00:24.833
I've never been away
from them this long.

00:24.858 --> 00:25.872
I don't like it.

00:25.897 --> 00:28.348
Look, don't start being
all dramatic, Janine.

00:28.373 --> 00:30.441
Now, I left my little prize
to keep them occupied,

00:30.466 --> 00:32.325
just like I did Malik and Jazzie.

00:32.359 --> 00:35.429
Uh, Uncle Curtis.
You left us two nickles.

00:37.497 --> 00:40.366
And you said rub them together.

00:40.391 --> 00:42.403
I was trying to teach you
the value of money.

00:42.451 --> 00:44.388
Okay, Mr. Value of Money.

00:44.427 --> 00:46.094
Can you please explain to me the value

00:46.095 --> 00:48.478
of why we can't use
the toilet on this thing?

00:48.704 --> 00:52.900
Because your uncle
does not value our bladder.

00:53.759 --> 00:56.548
You know, I don't know how to take that.

00:57.009 --> 01:00.772
Look, when I return this thing,
I want my full deposit.

01:00.889 --> 01:03.936
And if anybody use the toilet,
I got to pay extra.

01:04.120 --> 01:05.975
So that it.

01:08.987 --> 01:10.732
Who the hell's that?

01:10.789 --> 01:13.083
Who's back there?

01:13.660 --> 01:16.559
- Your son.
- I ain't got no son!

01:17.362 --> 01:20.170
Come out the bathroom!

01:20.632 --> 01:22.170
Hey!

01:22.295 --> 01:23.295
Curtis.

01:23.358 --> 01:24.779
You get out of there!

01:24.943 --> 01:26.975
- Pop!
- "Pop" my ass!

01:26.999 --> 01:28.678
Come out that doggone bathroom!

01:28.703 --> 01:30.735
Uncle Curtis, please.
As long as he's been in there,

01:30.736 --> 01:32.515
let's just leave
the door closed, please.

01:32.636 --> 01:34.704
And keep it sealed like the CDC.

01:34.743 --> 01:36.359
- Yes.
- What?

01:36.421 --> 01:38.961
Calvin, you come out of there right now!

01:39.370 --> 01:41.750
Nobody playing with you.

01:45.396 --> 01:46.883
Whew!

01:47.310 --> 01:50.196
- Who's next?
- We all pass.

01:51.744 --> 01:54.603
Did you use the bathroom?

01:54.789 --> 01:56.423
I did.

01:56.558 --> 01:58.427
Didn't I give you a milk carton?

02:00.549 --> 02:02.383
Pops, I'm not going in a milk carton.

02:02.408 --> 02:05.445
You go in there again.
Go on in there. Go.

02:05.487 --> 02:07.121
I promise, swerve this thing so hard,

02:07.189 --> 02:08.660
whatever you put in there,
you gonna be wearing it.

02:08.685 --> 02:11.787
Okay, just stop.
Just... ugh! Disgusting.

02:11.907 --> 02:13.140
How much longer?

02:13.165 --> 02:15.421
Please tell me we're almost there.

02:15.714 --> 02:19.183
Well, should be about
30 miles to the church.

02:19.258 --> 02:20.492
We should've flown.

02:20.493 --> 02:22.187
And who gonna pay for that, Calvin?

02:22.265 --> 02:24.863
Pops, this is your uncle's funeral.

02:24.864 --> 02:28.048
Everybody, just stop it.
It's really not that bad.

02:28.217 --> 02:31.586
What I want to know is why you
insisted on all of us coming.

02:31.696 --> 02:33.845
We don't know this dude.

02:34.910 --> 02:38.897
I got a surprise for your
auntie, and it's life-changing.

02:39.116 --> 02:41.631
And I can't wait for y'all to see it.

02:41.786 --> 02:44.444
Oh, Lord, this ain't gonna be good.

02:46.627 --> 02:48.161
It's gonna be great.

02:48.186 --> 02:50.466
What... what are you talking about?

02:51.015 --> 02:52.582
What are you talking about?

02:54.117 --> 02:56.508
Curtis, what are you talking about?

02:56.533 --> 02:57.790
Curtis, I'm for real.

03:03.309 --> 03:05.365
We sitting back here.

03:05.521 --> 03:07.591
Yeah, that's the problem.

03:26.051 --> 03:28.053
Thing is making me itch.

03:29.597 --> 03:31.855
Then sit somewhere else.

03:32.495 --> 03:35.825
Sit where?
You want me to sit on the roof?

03:35.902 --> 03:38.512
- Please do.
- Anywhere.

03:39.707 --> 03:41.864
- Everything's making me itch!
- Okay, all your complaining

03:41.888 --> 03:43.020
is really giving me a headache.

03:43.045 --> 03:44.676
When did you become such a diva?

03:44.736 --> 03:47.665
- Excuse me?
- You heard what I said.

03:47.800 --> 03:49.690
"Oh, this... This making me itch.

03:49.753 --> 03:51.792
Oh, Lord."

03:52.253 --> 03:54.278
Are you really talking to me right now?

03:54.279 --> 03:58.081
Because, I mean, you're sitting
on a silk sheet on your seat.

03:58.156 --> 04:00.091
Yes, that's because I brought it.

04:00.131 --> 04:01.839
It's for me. Okay?

04:01.870 --> 04:04.315
Only the best for Jazmine Payne.

04:05.128 --> 04:07.525
Well, just be nice to your brother.

04:07.550 --> 04:09.097
You can share. Come on.

04:09.165 --> 04:10.590
- Share?
- Yeah.

04:10.615 --> 04:13.017
Oh, no thank you. This is for this diva.

04:15.730 --> 04:17.940
Why we even going
to this funeral anyway?

04:17.940 --> 04:19.011
I mean, the guy's dead.

04:19.031 --> 04:21.867
It's not like he's gonna
realize that we're not there.

04:24.346 --> 04:27.715
Pops, when was the last time
you even seen Uncle Robert?

04:27.966 --> 04:31.140
It was 1979.

04:31.248 --> 04:33.048
- What?
- Yes.

04:33.049 --> 04:35.384
- Oh, baby, stop that.
- I remember it, Curtis.

04:35.385 --> 04:36.886
You all were arguing over the fact

04:36.887 --> 04:39.351
that he did not pay you your quarters.

04:39.808 --> 04:42.633
And you vowed to never see him again.

04:42.671 --> 04:45.507
You sure made that happen, didn't you?

04:46.308 --> 04:47.909
But can somebody please explain to me

04:47.910 --> 04:49.482
why we're driving
all the way to a funeral

04:49.507 --> 04:52.279
for a relative that we don't know?

04:53.045 --> 04:55.139
Because Uncle Richard
was my favorite uncle.

04:55.277 --> 04:57.893
- R-Robert.
- Um, Uncle Robert.

04:57.956 --> 05:00.198
Right, okay.

05:00.223 --> 05:02.495
- Yeah.
- You remember him, Calvin.

05:02.933 --> 05:05.034
No, I don't.

05:05.562 --> 05:06.929
He the one who used
to throw them oranges

05:06.954 --> 05:08.626
and hit you in the head with them.

05:09.196 --> 05:11.368
That was you.

05:11.666 --> 05:14.306
Oh, yeah, you right.

05:15.103 --> 05:18.240
I remember him, and he was so nice.

05:18.273 --> 05:21.357
He actually gave us $200
when we got married.

05:21.686 --> 05:24.154
- What? He gave y'all $200?
- $200!

05:24.155 --> 05:26.782
Aw, man, no wonder
you're so wealthy now.

05:28.816 --> 05:30.950
So, we're trying to repay the 200

05:30.975 --> 05:33.993
by suffering 2,000 miles to Florida?
Is that it?

05:34.907 --> 05:36.990
Baby, don't you like it
out here in Florida?

05:37.037 --> 05:39.623
- It is beautiful.
- It is nice, Curtis.

05:39.696 --> 05:43.357
But I like the oak trees
and the pine trees in Atlanta.

05:43.475 --> 05:45.977
Yeah. Now, they got
pine trees in Florida, now.

05:45.978 --> 05:47.569
Not like Georgia.

05:47.764 --> 05:51.538
Yeah, well, I mean, this
a great place to retire, though.

05:51.781 --> 05:53.546
Yeah, it's nice.

05:53.835 --> 05:55.280
You agree?

05:55.374 --> 05:56.785
Yes, it is, Curtis. It's nice.

05:56.786 --> 05:58.901
How many times you want me
to tell you that? It's nice.

05:59.155 --> 06:01.541
Said you agree, that's all.

06:01.640 --> 06:03.244
Yes, it is.

06:03.675 --> 06:05.910
And look... Look at all that water.

06:05.911 --> 06:07.912
You see all that water?

06:07.913 --> 06:11.223
You could get baptized all day
in this water.

06:11.387 --> 06:13.734
- We go fishing.
- Curt.

06:13.885 --> 06:15.653
I mean, if we was there,
we'd go fishing.

06:15.654 --> 06:17.707
Curtis, you scared of worms.

06:17.823 --> 06:19.425
Ain't nobody scared of no worm.

06:19.511 --> 06:21.045
Uncle Curtis, you scared of worms?

06:21.046 --> 06:22.379
I ain't scared of no worms.

06:22.380 --> 06:24.542
Please. Not since I got saved.

06:28.987 --> 06:30.767
I am saved, right?

06:32.619 --> 06:34.767
You said I was saved, Ella.

06:35.092 --> 06:37.025
Well, no, you didn't say that.

06:37.207 --> 06:39.409
- Curtis.
- I must've dreamed it.

06:41.717 --> 06:43.918
Well, look like we're here.

06:43.966 --> 06:45.785
Where?

06:45.904 --> 06:48.052
All right, Cousin Joann's house.

06:48.130 --> 06:51.539
Everybody, y'all go inside and
get dressed for the celebration.

06:51.648 --> 06:52.849
I mean the funeral.

06:55.053 --> 06:56.353
Where are you going?

06:56.597 --> 06:58.785
Baby, we be right there.
I got to take Calvin and C.J.

06:58.832 --> 07:00.958
- To see something.
- Okay. Hurry up, Curtis.

07:00.959 --> 07:03.828
I do not want to be late
for the celeb... uh, funeral.

07:06.059 --> 07:07.760
We'll be all right.

07:07.878 --> 07:10.601
- Janine, open my door from the outside.
- I'm coming around, Aunt Ella.

07:10.602 --> 07:12.954
Won't be late.

07:13.069 --> 07:15.472
Ain't like he gonna know it.

07:17.082 --> 07:19.485
Child lock.

07:20.470 --> 07:23.008
- Hurry back, Curtis.
- Okay.

07:23.312 --> 07:25.798
So, Pops, where are we going?

07:25.891 --> 07:27.691
I want you to see the
surprise for your mama.

07:27.810 --> 07:30.056
- What is it?
- You'll see.

07:34.544 --> 07:38.180
- Look! Go look, go look!
- What am I looking at?

07:38.369 --> 07:40.905
Go look, and watch your step.

07:43.309 --> 07:45.574
Okay, okay.

07:45.912 --> 07:47.394
Surprise!

07:47.655 --> 07:50.340
What, uh...

07:50.583 --> 07:52.730
What is this?

07:52.998 --> 07:55.432
Look! Surprise.

07:55.621 --> 07:57.323
I'm looking.

07:57.408 --> 07:59.843
And I'm surprised you didn't
fall through the floor.

08:01.909 --> 08:03.963
Look.

08:04.365 --> 08:07.096
Surprise.

08:07.602 --> 08:09.373
What are we looking at?

08:09.570 --> 08:11.771
Me and your mama's retirement home.

08:11.974 --> 08:13.942
- What?
- Hello!

08:14.084 --> 08:16.218
What are you talking about?

08:16.477 --> 08:19.413
This is where we're gonna
live out the rest of our days.

08:19.506 --> 08:21.897
That's what I'm talking about.

08:21.988 --> 08:23.589
Think you won't have long.

08:25.232 --> 08:26.499
Hmm.

08:26.671 --> 08:29.473
Uncle Curtis, what's going on?

08:29.607 --> 08:31.241
When your uncle Rutherford died...

08:31.242 --> 08:34.586
- Robert.
- W-whatever.

08:34.845 --> 08:38.548
He left us this house and his business.

08:38.549 --> 08:41.160
- What business?
- Laundromat.

08:41.380 --> 08:43.881
Uh, Pops, this is not
a nice neighborhood.

08:43.904 --> 08:46.005
No, but they fixed it up.
They fixed it up.

08:46.006 --> 08:47.640
They built a... they got
a grocery store down there.

08:47.641 --> 08:48.880
- They got...
- Uncle Curtis,

08:48.905 --> 08:51.540
Aunt Ella is not gonna go for this.

08:51.657 --> 08:53.509
Yeah, she will. You'll see.

08:53.657 --> 08:55.258
I'm telling you now.

08:55.376 --> 08:56.443
That she will.

08:56.553 --> 08:57.819
No. I know my mama,

08:57.820 --> 09:00.142
and there's no way she's going for this.

09:00.307 --> 09:02.415
Wait. You didn't tell her?

09:02.502 --> 09:05.650
Can't you see the potential
in this place, man?

09:05.762 --> 09:07.900
When we fix it up!

09:08.191 --> 09:10.993
Put mirrors all everywhere.

09:11.142 --> 09:12.793
Up in the ceiling.

09:12.967 --> 09:14.895
A pole.

09:15.072 --> 09:17.566
Cover pole.

09:18.525 --> 09:19.860
He didn't tell her.

09:21.222 --> 09:23.194
I thought we were here
for his uncle's funeral.

09:23.233 --> 09:25.186
We here for his.

09:26.843 --> 09:28.877
My mama's not going for this.

09:29.366 --> 09:30.818
No, she is not.

09:30.843 --> 09:33.048
Look, the widow and the children
didn't even want the house.

09:33.188 --> 09:35.650
So, I bought it from them
before the funeral.

09:35.651 --> 09:37.019
Wait a minute.

09:37.020 --> 09:39.421
Didn't you just say
they left you the house?

09:39.446 --> 09:43.429
They sold it to me for so cheap
they might as well have left it.

09:43.793 --> 09:46.640
Oh, and wait. Here's the best part.

09:46.929 --> 09:49.164
I packed up everything at the old house,

09:49.351 --> 09:50.694
and me and your auntie moving in.

09:50.813 --> 09:53.014
And we gonna open up the business.

09:53.148 --> 09:54.816
- Wow.
- You heard me.

09:54.896 --> 09:56.882
So y'all just leaving us in Atlanta?

09:56.921 --> 09:59.155
Yes, sir.

09:59.422 --> 10:01.556
My mama said she'll never leave me.

10:01.679 --> 10:03.127
Don't sit down there!

10:03.128 --> 10:05.029
I know, I know, I know.

10:13.066 --> 10:17.002
Man. I can't believe this.

10:17.003 --> 10:19.104
I can't believe Mama agreed to it.

10:19.106 --> 10:21.207
- Aunt Ella done changed.
- Right.

10:21.207 --> 10:23.242
She said she would never leave Atlanta.

10:23.243 --> 10:24.869
- Yeah.
- Wow.

10:30.155 --> 10:32.131
Pops, why y'all didn't tell us?

10:32.147 --> 10:33.815
I'm telling you now.

10:33.816 --> 10:36.420
No, no. No, no. Hold on.

10:36.652 --> 10:39.654
Aunt Ella asked Miss Claretha
to water the plants

10:39.655 --> 10:41.022
and get the mail.

10:41.023 --> 10:42.960
What?

10:44.257 --> 10:46.131
Right.

10:46.461 --> 10:48.596
And she told me the other day
to go over there

10:48.597 --> 10:51.314
and turn on the lights so people
would think we're still home.

10:51.404 --> 10:53.197
What?

10:53.221 --> 10:55.423
Why would she do all of that

10:55.462 --> 10:58.228
if she was packing up all her
stuff and never coming back?

10:58.308 --> 11:00.210
I don't know why she'd do that.

11:03.619 --> 11:06.124
- Wait.
- Yes?

11:07.490 --> 11:09.759
- Uncle Curtis.
- Huh?

11:11.638 --> 11:13.741
- Pops.
- Yes?

11:15.869 --> 11:17.704
Does Mama know about all of this?

11:17.831 --> 11:19.723
Yeah, she know.

11:20.587 --> 11:21.988
She don't know.

11:23.900 --> 11:25.469
She'll know when I tell her.

11:28.288 --> 11:32.234
Wait, so you mean to tell me
you sold all your things?

11:32.518 --> 11:36.193
You don't listen. I didn't sell it.
I packed it up.

11:36.384 --> 11:37.986
It'll be here tomorrow.

11:38.654 --> 11:40.021
"Here" where?

11:40.435 --> 11:42.552
Here here.

11:43.250 --> 11:45.102
To this place?

11:45.786 --> 11:47.446
Yes.

11:47.684 --> 11:51.320
- He can't be serious.
- Y'all trippin'!

11:51.525 --> 11:53.960
All this place needs is...
is a little fixing up.

11:53.961 --> 11:55.656
That's it.

11:56.109 --> 11:58.610
And a little... a little paint.

11:58.971 --> 12:01.707
A little more color on the gang signs.

12:03.963 --> 12:05.791
Little sweeping.

12:06.099 --> 12:08.298
That's when I wish you was here.

12:08.893 --> 12:11.561
- Little trimming.
- Hey.

12:11.804 --> 12:12.904
New numbers.

12:12.929 --> 12:14.697
Hey, hey.

12:14.904 --> 12:16.605
- Pops.
- Lights.

12:17.310 --> 12:19.222
Can I have your truck?

12:20.947 --> 12:22.314
What?

12:22.315 --> 12:24.125
When you die today.

12:24.993 --> 12:27.102
That's all I want you to leave me.

12:27.166 --> 12:29.587
You just gonna be a hater
your whole life, ain't you?

12:29.690 --> 12:32.407
You ain't never gonna
let it go, are you?

12:33.124 --> 12:34.625
You got the keys right now?

12:34.704 --> 12:36.425
No.

12:37.505 --> 12:40.542
I don't know if they got
a big enough casket for you.

12:41.688 --> 12:43.355
I don't need one.

12:43.356 --> 12:46.141
I'm gonna wrap myself up.

12:46.819 --> 12:49.387
And fly-y-y-y!

12:52.365 --> 12:55.282
It was a lovely service.

12:55.435 --> 12:58.003
And I'm so glad you're gonna be around.

12:58.004 --> 12:59.228
What?

12:59.315 --> 13:00.682
She talking about in spirit, baby.

13:00.707 --> 13:02.618
What is she talking about?

13:02.650 --> 13:04.276
You know she be hitting that sauce.

13:04.277 --> 13:05.596
Curtis.

13:05.643 --> 13:07.277
Well, I would love to just...

13:07.278 --> 13:11.057
We have so many people
in need here at the church.

13:11.110 --> 13:13.246
We need a good, strong leader like you.

13:13.293 --> 13:14.560
Well, thank you.

13:14.590 --> 13:18.392
- But I live in Atlanta, and so...
- Well, now you...

13:18.393 --> 13:20.628
O-okay. That's enough talking.

13:20.629 --> 13:23.249
All right, Cousin Joann.
Good to see you. Thank you, bye.

13:23.274 --> 13:25.639
- Oh.
- Thank you.

13:25.773 --> 13:28.428
- All right. See you later!
- Bye.

13:28.709 --> 13:30.639
Almost got busted.

13:30.778 --> 13:33.113
What is she talking about?

13:33.114 --> 13:35.248
Baby, I told you.
You know she on that bottle.

13:37.197 --> 13:40.664
- Okay, can we go now?
- Yes, please. Come on.

13:40.728 --> 13:42.896
We got a long ride and I got
to get back to a date.

13:42.897 --> 13:43.854
Come on, y'all.

13:44.202 --> 13:47.463
Yeah, okay.
I just need to make one stop.

13:47.622 --> 13:49.698
The one stop that'll end it all.

13:50.487 --> 13:52.526
I got to say, Curtis,

13:52.674 --> 13:54.107
when you said you were gonna drive

13:54.140 --> 13:57.945
all the way to Florida
in this R.V., I was skeptical.

13:58.094 --> 14:00.187
Yeah. You sure was, yeah.

14:00.226 --> 14:03.461
Yeah, I mean, really. All the way.

14:03.602 --> 14:05.771
Wait till you find out what he did.

14:07.546 --> 14:09.680
C.J., you want to get out?

14:09.869 --> 14:12.313
No. No, no, I got to see this.

14:13.915 --> 14:16.449
Well, you gonna get
run over. Keep it up.

14:16.551 --> 14:18.503
Trying to throw me under the bus.

14:18.654 --> 14:21.690
You gonna get run over
by a bus when she finds out.

14:24.026 --> 14:25.889
Finds out what?

14:26.540 --> 14:28.553
Baby, it's not good.

14:28.771 --> 14:31.173
It's... it's... It's not good at all.

14:33.091 --> 14:34.679
What is it?

14:35.442 --> 14:36.643
You'll see.

14:38.869 --> 14:41.371
That was a lovely funeral.

14:41.396 --> 14:44.198
I mean, she laid him to rest.

14:44.199 --> 14:45.699
Didn't he... Didn't he look natural?

14:45.700 --> 14:48.776
- He did.
- He looked so natural.

14:49.046 --> 14:50.379
Hair looked good.

14:50.465 --> 14:51.832
- It did.
- Everything.

14:51.857 --> 14:54.370
But you know who looked the best?

14:54.604 --> 14:56.839
My baby.

14:56.997 --> 14:59.269
- You look so good there, baby.
- Curtis, stop.

14:59.355 --> 15:01.003
Baby, I'm not playing with you.

15:01.068 --> 15:03.425
- Okay.
- All that black on.

15:03.683 --> 15:05.940
- You have me back in the day.
- Curtis.

15:06.219 --> 15:08.426
Back when we used to wear
black all the time.

15:08.778 --> 15:10.817
- You look good, baby.
- Thank you.

15:10.842 --> 15:12.324
- You do, too.
- My lovely sweet.

15:12.325 --> 15:13.392
Curtis.

15:13.393 --> 15:15.535
And you know, you know you lost weight.

15:15.638 --> 15:18.006
- You lost weight.
- I know.

15:18.007 --> 15:19.975
Baby, you have.

15:19.976 --> 15:21.475
I mean, I know I done lost weight,

15:21.500 --> 15:23.617
but you done lost weight.

15:23.778 --> 15:26.148
Even your ankles ain't swollen no more.

15:26.782 --> 15:29.072
Curtis, my ankles were never swollen.

15:29.097 --> 15:30.552
They really not swollen now.

15:30.553 --> 15:32.621
Shut up. Why you being so nice to me?

15:32.622 --> 15:34.418
Oh.

15:34.677 --> 15:36.713
I'm always nice to you, Ella.

15:38.778 --> 15:40.712
Oh, go ahead and tell her, Pops.

15:40.713 --> 15:42.762
Hush.

15:43.444 --> 15:45.979
- What's going on?
- Tell her.

15:46.175 --> 15:48.231
Shh!

15:48.591 --> 15:50.184
Aunt Ella.

15:50.489 --> 15:53.317
Uncle Curtis has something
he wants to tell you.

15:53.494 --> 15:54.803
Shut the door!

15:54.963 --> 15:56.928
Don't trip.

15:57.498 --> 16:00.014
Can somebody please just say what it is?

16:00.170 --> 16:02.733
Are you Uncle Curtis?

16:04.405 --> 16:07.141
You know what? All I know is
I want to get off this R.V.

16:09.169 --> 16:11.333
Wasn't this fun?

16:11.454 --> 16:13.622
- This fun.
- Yeah.

16:13.796 --> 16:15.130
A funeral.

16:15.131 --> 16:16.264
Fun.

16:16.289 --> 16:18.477
Wee!

16:19.194 --> 16:20.754
I have to say,

16:20.779 --> 16:22.780
it was really nice having
the whole family together,

16:22.805 --> 16:25.149
even if my babies couldn't be here.

16:25.383 --> 16:26.905
It's really sweet, a road trip.

16:27.039 --> 16:29.006
Looks like we'll be taking
a lot more of these.

16:29.108 --> 16:31.061
What?

16:31.788 --> 16:33.311
See Pops.

16:33.647 --> 16:36.093
But Aunt Ella will be right
across the street from us.

16:36.191 --> 16:37.893
Right, Uncle Curtis?

16:40.085 --> 16:44.086
- What are y'all talking about?
- Baby, they just talking about

16:44.111 --> 16:46.715
how nice it is all
the family back together.

16:46.887 --> 16:48.955
Except Calvin.

16:48.956 --> 16:50.535
What?

16:50.645 --> 16:53.339
Been to divorce court lately?

16:54.328 --> 16:57.303
You in divorce court
more than a divorce lawyer.

16:57.366 --> 17:00.635
- Will you stop it?
- I'm just saying.

17:00.660 --> 17:03.413
One good "shut up" deserves another.

17:03.467 --> 17:05.297
And you still won't shut up.

17:05.298 --> 17:08.502
Why don't you shut up?
Then... then I'll shut up.

17:08.540 --> 17:10.186
How about that?

17:10.272 --> 17:12.459
Well, you gonna be doing
a lot of talking once Mama

17:12.483 --> 17:13.459
finds out that you...

17:13.483 --> 17:15.647
Curtis!

17:16.041 --> 17:20.243
I'm sorry, baby.
There was an idiot in the road.

17:20.512 --> 17:23.481
No, the only idiot is behind the wheel.

17:23.549 --> 17:25.432
- You know what?
- Yo, bro.

17:25.550 --> 17:28.054
Baby, please, just don't poke the bear.

17:30.132 --> 17:32.825
Right, 'cause that's a big
ol' bear you're poking.

17:35.562 --> 17:37.896
I heard that.

17:38.030 --> 17:39.565
Ooh, I'm scared.

17:41.439 --> 17:42.506
Jaz.

17:42.552 --> 17:44.677
- Oh, no!
- What?

17:44.770 --> 17:46.605
We're going through another dead zone.

17:46.747 --> 17:48.894
I think it's actually nice
that we're spending time

17:48.919 --> 17:50.551
with the family
and off of these devices.

17:50.576 --> 17:53.111
- Right.
- You too, Calvin.

17:53.112 --> 17:55.676
Oh, oh, I was checking on my kids.

17:56.637 --> 17:59.540
Yeah, if your kids' names
is Bae and Stella.

18:02.606 --> 18:04.007
Curtis.

18:04.008 --> 18:06.663
Curtis, baby, this is not
the way to the freeway.

18:06.811 --> 18:10.341
- I'm taking a shortcut, baby.
- Through this neighborhood?

18:10.366 --> 18:12.415
This neighborhood is not nice at all.

18:12.416 --> 18:14.951
- Lock the doors.
- Oh, please.

18:15.031 --> 18:16.928
We black. Stop it.

18:17.607 --> 18:20.584
We black without weapons.

18:21.225 --> 18:23.393
Why do you have to go this way?

18:23.394 --> 18:25.762
Because I told you, baby,
I got a surprise for you.

18:25.763 --> 18:29.566
- That's what you calling it?
- That's what he said.

18:29.677 --> 18:31.668
What is going on?

18:33.182 --> 18:35.507
Curtis, we have a nine-hour drive home.

18:35.532 --> 18:36.718
Let's get to the freeway.

18:36.743 --> 18:38.610
You're closer to home than you think.

18:38.611 --> 18:40.413
Curtis!

18:43.793 --> 18:45.994
- Sorry. Keep it up.
- Come on, baby.

18:46.019 --> 18:47.921
I don't know why you getting mad at me.

18:51.124 --> 18:53.603
We're here.

18:53.681 --> 18:55.281
Okay, y'all, come on.

18:55.361 --> 18:57.368
- Get out.
- Mnh-mnh. No.

18:57.630 --> 18:59.532
You better get out!
Everybody, come on, get out!

18:59.675 --> 19:02.017
Everybody come on.

19:02.042 --> 19:03.275
Janine.

19:03.300 --> 19:05.101
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.

19:07.601 --> 19:09.186
Don't look, don't look.

19:13.132 --> 19:14.665
Welcome.

19:15.108 --> 19:17.049
Curtis, what is this?

19:17.610 --> 19:19.043
A haunted house?

19:22.431 --> 19:23.564
You all hear that?

19:23.565 --> 19:25.692
I think I can hear
the ghost of the past.

19:29.972 --> 19:32.809
Nope. Those will be
the gunshots of your future.

19:32.965 --> 19:35.715
- Okay. Okay, honey, listen.
- You shut up.

19:35.811 --> 19:37.011
- Shut your...
- You shut up.

19:37.012 --> 19:39.965
Listen. I'm tired
and I'm ready to go home.

19:40.012 --> 19:42.075
My feet hurt from these heels.

19:42.470 --> 19:44.512
Baby, you ain't got on no heels.

19:50.859 --> 19:52.596
We are home, baby.

19:53.562 --> 19:54.629
We home.

19:54.630 --> 19:56.764
What... What you talking about? What?

19:56.765 --> 19:58.200
Surprise!

20:00.269 --> 20:02.640
Baby, I bought it!

20:05.808 --> 20:08.311
