WEBVTT

01:19.663 --> 01:23.834
Sometimes, I get a good feeling, yeah

01:23.917 --> 01:25.419
Yeah

01:28.172 --> 01:30.215
I get a feeling

01:30.299 --> 01:33.802
That I never, never
Never, never had before

01:33.886 --> 01:35.512
No, no

01:35.596 --> 01:38.765
Yeah

01:38.849 --> 01:43.478
I just wanna tell you right now that I

01:45.606 --> 01:47.107
I believe

01:47.691 --> 01:50.903
I really do believe that

01:50.986 --> 01:54.239
Something's got a hold on me, yeah

01:54.323 --> 01:56.658
Oh, it must be love

01:56.742 --> 02:00.871
Oh, something's got a hold
On me right now, child

02:00.954 --> 02:02.706
Oh, it must be love

02:02.789 --> 02:04.374
Let me tell you now

02:04.458 --> 02:07.377
I got a feeling I feel so strange

02:07.461 --> 02:10.214
Everything about me
Seems to have changed

02:24.144 --> 02:27.189
Yeah, oh, it must be love

02:27.272 --> 02:28.607
You know it must be love

02:28.690 --> 02:30.108
Let me tell you now

02:30.192 --> 02:32.986
My heart feels heavy
My feet feel light

02:33.070 --> 02:35.906
I shake all over, but I feel all right

02:35.989 --> 02:38.158
I never felt like this before

02:38.242 --> 02:40.410
Angela Rose, do you copy?

02:40.494 --> 02:42.579
-OK, copy.
-You guys coming in?

02:42.663 --> 02:46.083
I never thought it could happen to me

02:46.166 --> 02:49.211
Got me happy when I'm in misery

02:49.294 --> 02:52.464
I never thought it could be this way

02:52.548 --> 02:55.008
Love's sure gone and put a hurt on me

02:55.092 --> 02:56.301
I said, oh

03:01.306 --> 03:03.141
Hey, hey, yeah

03:03.225 --> 03:05.060
Oh, it must be love

03:05.143 --> 03:06.562
You know it must be love

03:06.645 --> 03:09.189
You know it walks like love

03:14.152 --> 03:15.571
I see you, Ruby!

03:15.654 --> 03:17.948
I'm cutting off your ice.
I'm not a freaking charity!

03:18.031 --> 03:19.491
It's coming!

03:19.575 --> 03:21.034
How you doing, honey?

03:21.118 --> 03:23.829
Hey, Ruby! I thought you guys
were fishing first ledge.

03:23.912 --> 03:25.706
You done already for the day?

03:27.124 --> 03:28.625
Piece of shit quotas.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.002
Bullshit quotas, right?

03:30.085 --> 03:32.671
What are you gonna give
on those haddock? 2 bucks a pound?

03:32.754 --> 03:35.090
-$2.50. And I'm being generous.
-$2.50?

03:35.174 --> 03:37.092
What are you guys getting at auction?

03:37.176 --> 03:39.303
Calm your liver.
Let me worry about numbers.

03:39.386 --> 03:40.596
Sign over here.

03:40.679 --> 03:42.764
What're you gonna
take her lunch money too?

03:49.813 --> 03:51.690
What a dick.

03:52.316 --> 03:54.610
I keep saying, let's sell our own fish.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.279
They tried it down the Cape.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.156
That all went to hell.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.074
So keep bitching. That'll work.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.285
I got to go. Love you, Dad.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.162
Don't forget about the doctor.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.873
And the nets.

04:07.956 --> 04:09.666
I know.

04:09.750 --> 04:13.045
Bye, shit-face.

04:14.379 --> 04:16.757
Bye, twat waffle.

04:16.839 --> 04:19.091
That's good. It's a new one!

04:19.176 --> 04:20.469
Gone and put a hurt on me

04:20.552 --> 04:21.595
I said, oh

04:26.225 --> 04:27.601
Hey, hey, yeah

04:27.684 --> 04:29.770
Oh, it must be love

04:29.853 --> 04:32.940
You know it must be love

04:33.023 --> 04:35.108
Where the Bill of Rights protected people

04:35.192 --> 04:40.364
from the federal government,
Amendments 13, 14 and 15

04:40.447 --> 04:43.200
protected them
from their state government.

04:44.952 --> 04:48.455
Sadly, there was no amendment
to protect the right to nap.

04:48.539 --> 04:50.332
Ruby... Ruby!

04:50.791 --> 04:52.626
What's wrong?

04:53.961 --> 04:55.963
OK, let's re-read.

04:56.046 --> 04:58.131
And we will resume this tomorrow.

04:58.215 --> 04:59.883
You are free to go!

05:07.558 --> 05:09.476
-Guess what!
-What?

05:09.560 --> 05:11.645
I did it. I hooked up with Tiny Fingers.

05:12.521 --> 05:13.605
Why?

05:14.106 --> 05:16.066
I don't know!
Curiosity got the better of me.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.651
Also, totally wrong!

05:17.734 --> 05:20.237
Despite his tiny little
baby hands, it's...

05:21.738 --> 05:22.739
Really?

05:23.240 --> 05:24.867
Yeah, we have to change the nickname.

05:24.950 --> 05:26.243
Do you smell fish?

05:32.040 --> 05:34.793
Well, at least she's not
doing deaf voice anymore.

05:36.378 --> 05:37.671
That's progress.

05:37.754 --> 05:38.964
Hey, Audra!

05:41.216 --> 05:42.634
Good. Just got out of music.

05:42.718 --> 05:44.219
-What do you got now?
-Math.

05:46.388 --> 05:49.683
So, the goal is to find the elective

05:49.766 --> 05:51.476
that asks the least of you.

05:53.645 --> 05:54.855
Like film club.

05:54.938 --> 05:58.400
Also known as "put your backpack
down and go smoke a bowl."

06:00.652 --> 06:02.696
Plus, Mr. Wabatch is actually
pretty hot, you know?

06:02.779 --> 06:04.239
Like, in a Comic-Con kind of way.

06:04.323 --> 06:05.741
Hi! Choir.

06:07.284 --> 06:08.827
Choir.

06:08.911 --> 06:10.662
OK, just fill this out.

06:10.746 --> 06:11.747
Choir?

06:13.874 --> 06:15.083
Are you high?

06:16.752 --> 06:18.170
I sing all the time.

06:18.253 --> 06:19.254
Thanks.

06:19.338 --> 06:22.090
OK, you're already socially challenged
enough here, but sure.

06:24.134 --> 06:26.053
If you start, you know, beatboxing

06:26.136 --> 06:29.515
or doing that cup clapping thing,
we're done, yeah?

06:37.940 --> 06:39.566
I don't need no words

06:39.650 --> 06:41.193
Gave you first and second chances

06:41.276 --> 06:43.237
You won't see no third

06:43.320 --> 06:45.864
Flying down the highway
and that car looks like a blur

06:46.240 --> 06:47.991
Turn it down!

06:48.075 --> 06:49.326
That's just what you deserve

06:49.409 --> 06:52.746
Black out on these haters
I never been a poser

06:52.829 --> 06:54.665
She bragging, saying I date her

06:56.542 --> 06:57.543
It's loud!

06:58.043 --> 07:00.420
You didn't change after fishing.

07:01.046 --> 07:02.339
You stink.

07:05.467 --> 07:07.761
I love rap music.

07:08.595 --> 07:11.598
My whole ass is vibrating.

07:13.225 --> 07:15.352
Just drive!

07:23.277 --> 07:26.572
It's definitely itchy as hell.

07:27.239 --> 07:28.282
It itches.

07:29.867 --> 07:33.704
My nuts are on fire.

07:35.998 --> 07:37.624
His, you know...

07:38.959 --> 07:43.380
They're like angry hard little beets.

07:44.173 --> 07:48.635
Covered in barnacles.

07:49.511 --> 07:50.554
I got it!

07:51.889 --> 07:54.558
And your mother's got it even worse.

07:56.685 --> 07:59.688
Like a boiled lobster claw.

07:59.771 --> 08:02.774
Right, well, so the layman's
term for what you both have

08:02.858 --> 08:03.984
is "jock itch."

08:04.067 --> 08:06.695
It's common if you spend
a lot of time in damp clothes,

08:06.778 --> 08:10.532
and it's easily
transferable via intercourse.

08:10.908 --> 08:13.076
-You guys have jock itch.
-I'll give you an antifungal cream,

08:13.160 --> 08:15.454
but you both have to keep the area dry

08:15.537 --> 08:17.831
and avoid sex for two weeks.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.710
You two need clean underwear.

08:22.127 --> 08:23.420
And...

08:23.504 --> 08:25.172
you're not allowed to do it anymore.

08:26.632 --> 08:27.883
What?

08:28.467 --> 08:30.260
For how long?

08:30.344 --> 08:31.970
Never again.

08:32.054 --> 08:33.222
Done for life.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.769
Two weeks.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.604
-Impossible.
-Can't do it.

09:08.090 --> 09:09.925
Take those off. It's rude.

09:11.385 --> 09:13.470
What's rude is how noisy you guys are!

09:13.554 --> 09:15.973
I can't focus.

09:18.767 --> 09:19.977
Go eat.

09:30.821 --> 09:34.366
You know why God made farts smell?

09:36.285 --> 09:39.913
So deaf people could enjoy them too.

09:49.715 --> 09:52.092
Don't slouch. You'll get stuck.

09:52.176 --> 09:53.802
Fifteen bucks, really?

09:53.886 --> 09:56.805
You choose weed, I choose wine.

09:59.433 --> 10:01.435
You don't want her! Swipe left.

10:02.227 --> 10:03.937
None of them smile?

10:04.313 --> 10:06.523
So? She's hot.

10:07.357 --> 10:08.692
When I was modeling...

10:08.775 --> 10:09.860
Here we go!

10:09.943 --> 10:13.530
Yes! Your mother was the best!

10:13.614 --> 10:15.908
First year I met her,
she won the Yankee Miss Pageant.

10:15.991 --> 10:17.534
"...she won the Yankee Miss Pageant."

10:17.618 --> 10:19.703
Beat all those hearing girls.

10:20.746 --> 10:22.664
She was hotter than all of them.

10:26.835 --> 10:28.128
What about her?

10:29.129 --> 10:30.339
So-so.

10:32.716 --> 10:36.762
I thought we said no Tinder at the table!

10:38.263 --> 10:41.350
How is music rude but Tinder's okay?

10:42.976 --> 10:46.855
Because Tinder is something
we can all do as a family.

11:06.416 --> 11:08.460
No, I did not tell you to sit.

11:08.544 --> 11:10.712
On your feet, my friends. Up, up!

11:12.130 --> 11:16.343
They made my latte with some kind of
disgusting nut milk this morning,

11:16.426 --> 11:17.678
so I'm in a mood.

11:18.428 --> 11:19.805
Hey, come on! Come on!

11:22.724 --> 11:25.185
My name is Bernardo Villalobos.

11:25.269 --> 11:27.312
Berrrnardo. Berrrna--

11:27.396 --> 11:29.439
If you can't roll your Rs,

11:29.523 --> 11:32.943
please, please, don't embarrass yourself,

11:33.026 --> 11:34.736
and just call me Mr. V.

11:36.530 --> 11:38.991
OK, all of you, on this side.

11:39.074 --> 11:41.076
Come on, move! Everyone to this side.

11:41.785 --> 11:42.870
Move!

11:43.704 --> 11:46.999
Let's see if you're an alto, a soprano

11:47.082 --> 11:49.251
or just watched too many episodes of Glee.

11:50.419 --> 11:53.338
My birthday was last Tuesday,
so in lieu of gifts,

11:53.422 --> 11:55.507
I will be accepting
the Happy Birthday song.

11:55.591 --> 11:58.218
I do not need an entire meal.

11:59.136 --> 12:01.180
I just want to place your voice.

12:01.263 --> 12:03.390
You, Harry Potter. Come on, let's hear it.

12:07.519 --> 12:12.149
Happy birthday to you

12:13.275 --> 12:14.693
Tenor. Next!

12:16.111 --> 12:19.198
Happy birthday to you

12:21.408 --> 12:22.409
Alto.

12:23.160 --> 12:24.369
Next!

12:26.288 --> 12:28.832
Happy birthday to you

12:28.916 --> 12:31.084
Happy birthday

12:31.168 --> 12:33.045
To you

12:33.128 --> 12:34.463
Happy birth...

12:34.546 --> 12:39.092
...day, Mr. Berrrnardo!

12:39.801 --> 12:40.802
Happy

12:40.886 --> 12:43.180
Bir...ir...ir

12:43.263 --> 12:45.599
Happy birthday

12:45.682 --> 12:48.685
To you

12:52.397 --> 12:53.398
Suave.

12:54.066 --> 12:56.068
-Thank you.
-Tenor. Next!

12:58.237 --> 13:00.155
Come on. Yeah, you!

13:01.615 --> 13:02.699
The red shirt.

13:05.994 --> 13:08.330
Bless me with your birthday wishes.

13:15.087 --> 13:16.088
Forget the words?

13:20.843 --> 13:23.554
No, no, don't look at them.
They're not gonna help you.

13:24.721 --> 13:26.098
Come on!

13:32.062 --> 13:33.105
We have a runner.

14:13.312 --> 14:17.482
Happy birthday

14:17.566 --> 14:21.195
To you

14:22.237 --> 14:26.241
Happy birthday

14:26.325 --> 14:29.411
To you

14:29.494 --> 14:32.873
Happy birthday

14:32.956 --> 14:36.793
Happy birthday

14:36.877 --> 14:40.547
Happy birthday

14:40.631 --> 14:44.801
To you

14:58.524 --> 15:00.692
The card was declined!

15:03.987 --> 15:05.948
I'll move money around tomorrow.

15:06.031 --> 15:07.324
It's embarrassing!

15:07.407 --> 15:08.659
What do you want me to do?

15:08.742 --> 15:12.621
I gotta pay for ice, fuel.

15:16.166 --> 15:18.710
Maybe we should sell the boat?

15:19.628 --> 15:21.129
And then what?

15:23.924 --> 15:26.760
It's the one thing I know how to do!

16:12.598 --> 16:14.808
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

16:16.894 --> 16:19.021
Yeah, how it is, is I can
barely feed my family.

16:19.104 --> 16:20.731
Yeah, I can't even maintain my boat.

16:20.814 --> 16:22.774
-It's bullshit!
-Listen, just take it easy.

16:22.858 --> 16:24.902
I'm just telling you
what's going on, all right?

16:24.985 --> 16:27.321
The feds are insisting on at-sea monitors.

16:27.404 --> 16:28.780
Observers are gonna come onto your boat

16:28.864 --> 16:30.657
to make sure you're not
breaking any rules.

16:30.741 --> 16:32.534
That's out of our pocket?

16:32.618 --> 16:34.703
So, I gotta pay to have a spy on my boat?

16:34.786 --> 16:36.246
How much is that gonna cost?

16:37.873 --> 16:39.041
It's $800 a day.

16:39.625 --> 16:41.543
$800 a day.

16:42.211 --> 16:45.839
That's more than we make in a day!

16:45.923 --> 16:47.549
Don't tell me. Tell them.

16:49.426 --> 16:51.762
I've known you guys for years. Come on.

16:51.845 --> 16:52.971
We're not making a...

16:53.055 --> 16:55.224
Oh, for Christ's sake! I know it sucks.

17:03.732 --> 17:04.733
Mr. V?

17:08.194 --> 17:09.570
I'm meditating.

17:11.365 --> 17:12.574
Two minutes to go.

17:14.451 --> 17:15.452
OK.

17:21.208 --> 17:22.459
Do you want me to wait or just--

17:34.263 --> 17:38.100
Most people who are terrified of singing
don't sign up for choir.

17:42.020 --> 17:43.981
Other kids make me nervous.

17:45.607 --> 17:47.234
I used to get made fun of.

17:50.237 --> 17:54.783
I talked funny
when I first started school.

17:57.119 --> 17:59.746
You're the girl with the deaf family?

18:03.166 --> 18:04.751
Everyone but you?

18:04.835 --> 18:05.919
Yeah.

18:07.546 --> 18:09.298
And you sing.

18:10.799 --> 18:12.134
Interesting.

18:13.552 --> 18:14.678
Are you any good?

18:15.804 --> 18:16.847
I don't know.

18:19.808 --> 18:21.685
Why did you run out of my class?

18:23.020 --> 18:24.897
I got scared.

18:24.980 --> 18:27.524
Of what? Other kids?

18:27.608 --> 18:29.067
Maybe.

18:31.111 --> 18:33.447
Or maybe finding out that I'm bad.

18:37.784 --> 18:40.204
Do you know what Bowie said
about Bob Dylan?

18:43.207 --> 18:45.834
"A voice like sand and glue."

18:46.710 --> 18:49.922
There are plenty of pretty voices
with nothing to say.

18:51.131 --> 18:53.091
Do you have something to say?

18:55.260 --> 18:57.179
I think so.

18:57.262 --> 18:58.555
Good.

18:58.972 --> 19:01.767
Then I'll see you in class...

19:02.601 --> 19:03.852
Bob.

19:12.528 --> 19:13.904
Really?

19:14.404 --> 19:16.782
Thank you! Thank you!

19:24.164 --> 19:26.208
-Please don't!
-No, I really... It might be good for you.

19:26.291 --> 19:27.292
Oh my God!

19:29.002 --> 19:30.003
Hi!

19:31.004 --> 19:34.383
Do you have a second to call Grandma?

19:35.092 --> 19:36.593
Use the video relay.

19:37.803 --> 19:40.055
It's awkward to talk to an interpreter.

19:40.722 --> 19:42.307
I have a friend over!

19:42.391 --> 19:45.310
Leave her alone. She's with a friend.

19:45.811 --> 19:47.271
Damn, Leo got hot!

19:48.772 --> 19:50.983
What? He can't hear me.

19:53.151 --> 19:55.654
Does he work out or are those,
like, fishing muscles?

19:55.737 --> 19:57.990
OK, stop. You cannot date my brother.

19:58.073 --> 19:59.116
Why?

19:59.199 --> 20:01.535
Because for you, dating just means sex,

20:02.160 --> 20:04.371
which I don't even want to think about.

20:04.454 --> 20:08.000
OK, I'm sure he doesn't need
his little sister protecting him.

20:08.083 --> 20:10.127
Can you just go back to trying
to get with teachers?

20:10.210 --> 20:12.588
-It's more entertaining.
-OK.

20:20.387 --> 20:21.388
Ruby?

20:23.557 --> 20:25.225
What the hell are we listening to?

20:25.309 --> 20:26.560
The Shaggs.

20:28.979 --> 20:30.981
This song is called My Pal Foot Foot.

20:33.483 --> 20:34.484
Ruby...

20:34.568 --> 20:35.736
Wait, wait.

20:35.819 --> 20:37.237
My pal's name is Foot Foot

20:37.321 --> 20:38.947
That's my favorite part, right there.

20:39.031 --> 20:40.991
-No!
-Right there.

20:41.074 --> 20:43.076
You find the weirdest shit!

20:43.160 --> 20:44.411
I never find him home

20:44.494 --> 20:46.496
Did you get this in the dollar bin?

20:47.581 --> 20:48.957
Wait, I have a serious question.

20:49.041 --> 20:50.584
What's the sign for...

20:51.710 --> 20:53.462
for, "You're really smoking hot"?

20:53.545 --> 20:54.546
No!

20:54.630 --> 20:56.381
What about, "We should totally get it on"?

20:56.465 --> 20:57.591
No!

20:57.674 --> 21:00.177
Is it just... this?

21:00.928 --> 21:03.430
Oh my God. No! Stop!

21:05.140 --> 21:06.558
Then show me!

21:28.121 --> 21:29.706
What's up with Gertie?

21:30.332 --> 21:33.001
She just told me she has herpes.

21:38.340 --> 21:40.968
Energy! Energy!

21:41.051 --> 21:46.598
Let's get it on

21:47.224 --> 21:50.018
Let's get it on

21:51.270 --> 21:53.063
I'm falling asleep!

21:53.146 --> 21:54.940
Let's get it on

21:55.023 --> 21:56.650
Guys, sounds like a funeral!

21:56.733 --> 21:58.735
Come on! Hey, hey, hey!

21:58.819 --> 22:00.445
Guys, come on!

22:00.529 --> 22:03.782
You're teenagers!
All you think about is getting it on.

22:05.450 --> 22:09.162
Bob, come here! Come! Get up here.

22:10.998 --> 22:12.082
Come on!

22:15.586 --> 22:16.920
Come on, sing!

22:23.635 --> 22:26.430
I've been really trying

22:26.513 --> 22:28.599
No, no. No, no, no. No.

22:29.016 --> 22:30.225
You're not breathing.

22:30.893 --> 22:34.146
There's no sound without breath,
and none of you are breathing.

22:34.980 --> 22:36.064
Fill your belly.

22:37.274 --> 22:38.275
Fill it up!

22:39.151 --> 22:41.195
Come on, that's not a belly!

22:41.278 --> 22:43.447
This... This is a belly!

22:45.616 --> 22:47.743
OK, follow me, follow me. Do this...

22:48.577 --> 22:50.996
Remember the little dog, big dog exercise?

22:51.079 --> 22:52.080
OK, little dog.

22:53.248 --> 22:54.750
Do it, come on!

22:56.627 --> 22:57.920
Push, push, push, push!

23:01.173 --> 23:02.216
Medium dog!

23:03.217 --> 23:04.218
Big dog!

23:08.805 --> 23:11.225
You're embarrassed? Really?

23:11.308 --> 23:14.937
Everyone, little dog, big dog!
Come on! And...

23:16.271 --> 23:19.149
Pant! Pant!

23:19.858 --> 23:21.151
Push! Medium dog!

23:24.363 --> 23:25.364
Big dog!

23:27.074 --> 23:28.700
Engage your core!

23:29.076 --> 23:30.410
Blow it out!

23:30.494 --> 23:33.580
Push, push, push, push, push!
Push! Push, push, push!

23:35.123 --> 23:38.168
Engage your core! Push, push, push!

23:38.252 --> 23:39.795
More, more!

23:41.421 --> 23:42.965
And sing!

23:44.883 --> 23:48.637
I've been really trying, baby

23:48.720 --> 23:49.721
Yes!

23:50.681 --> 23:55.727
Trying to hold back
This feeling for so long

23:55.811 --> 23:57.479
Now we're talking!

23:57.563 --> 24:01.692
And if you feel like I feel, baby

24:03.193 --> 24:04.528
Come on

24:06.113 --> 24:08.365
Come on

24:12.703 --> 24:13.954
Well...

24:14.788 --> 24:16.748
it's not sand and glue.

24:17.457 --> 24:18.709
Go.

24:27.467 --> 24:28.677
Shoo!

24:30.095 --> 24:32.514
Ruby, Miles...

24:33.891 --> 24:35.100
Come here, come here.

24:38.061 --> 24:39.897
Today, if it's possible.

24:39.980 --> 24:41.106
Thank you.

24:42.858 --> 24:44.193
Do you guys know each other?

24:44.651 --> 24:46.236
-Kind of.
-Yeah.

24:49.323 --> 24:50.365
Yeah.

24:50.449 --> 24:51.950
I need a duet.

24:52.618 --> 24:54.286
I need a duet for the fall concert.

24:55.662 --> 24:57.539
You're All I Need to Get By.

24:57.623 --> 24:58.749
-You know it?
-Yeah.

24:58.832 --> 24:59.666
Know it?

25:02.044 --> 25:03.295
Educate yourself.

25:05.506 --> 25:06.965
We'll work next class.

25:12.471 --> 25:14.848
-You're all
-Like the sweet morning dew

25:14.932 --> 25:15.891
I need

25:15.974 --> 25:17.184
I took one look at you

25:17.267 --> 25:18.352
To get by

25:18.435 --> 25:20.604
And it was plain to see

25:20.687 --> 25:22.356
You were my destiny

25:22.439 --> 25:23.482
You're all...

25:23.565 --> 25:25.984
With my arms open wide

25:26.068 --> 25:28.070
I threw away my pride

25:28.153 --> 25:30.781
I'll sacrifice for you

25:30.864 --> 25:33.325
Dedicate my life to you

25:33.408 --> 25:35.994
-I will go where you lead
-Come on, baby

25:36.078 --> 25:38.497
Always there in time of need

25:38.580 --> 25:40.541
And when I lose my will

25:40.624 --> 25:43.001
You'll be there to push me up the hill

25:43.085 --> 25:47.381
There's no, no looking back for us

25:48.090 --> 25:52.344
We got love sure enough, that's enough

25:52.427 --> 25:54.054
You're all

25:54.137 --> 25:55.681
You're all I need

26:01.353 --> 26:02.563
800 for 3.

26:02.646 --> 26:04.064
That's as good as I can go.

26:04.147 --> 26:06.191
But I'll take 'em all, OK? Yeah?

26:06.275 --> 26:07.401
All right.

26:09.319 --> 26:10.404
Dad's out back.

26:10.487 --> 26:11.488
What are you giving him?

26:11.572 --> 26:13.574
Stop. I got this.

26:14.157 --> 26:15.367
2.75.

26:17.077 --> 26:19.580
I just heard Tony tell McKinney it was 3.

26:19.663 --> 26:22.541
And his shit looks like
it's been baking in the sun.

26:22.624 --> 26:25.127
Come on! It's 3,
or we take our catch back.

26:25.210 --> 26:27.296
Ruby, get out of here. Out of here!

26:28.881 --> 26:30.424
He's ripping you off!

26:39.433 --> 26:41.185
We're out in public!

26:43.437 --> 26:44.938
It's medical.

26:45.480 --> 26:49.401
I don't think being deaf
makes it legal to spark a fatty.

26:49.776 --> 26:51.153
What the hell was that?

26:52.029 --> 26:53.989
I got the price up, didn't I?

26:54.072 --> 26:57.993
I was handling it!
You made me look stupid.

26:58.076 --> 27:01.580
No, you look stupid when Gio throws out
any number he wants

27:01.663 --> 27:03.665
and you can't cross-check it!

27:04.333 --> 27:05.334
Guys!

27:06.710 --> 27:08.295
You want to fight,

27:08.754 --> 27:12.466
go fight those assholes!

27:13.926 --> 27:16.386
Our family sticks together.

27:21.141 --> 27:25.896
I'd give my left nut to tell them
to go screw themselves.

27:28.482 --> 27:29.650
So do it!

27:30.567 --> 27:32.778
Who's gonna sell our fish?

27:33.195 --> 27:34.321
Us!

27:49.002 --> 27:53.799
Oh, it's your thing
Do what you wanna do

27:55.384 --> 27:59.805
I can't tell you who to sock it to

27:59.888 --> 28:04.017
It's your thing, do what you wanna do

28:05.811 --> 28:09.857
I can't tell you who to sock it to

28:09.940 --> 28:14.361
If you want me to love you
Maybe I will

28:15.279 --> 28:19.575
Believe me woman, it ain't no big deal

28:20.450 --> 28:25.497
Oh, you need love now
Just as bad as I do

28:25.581 --> 28:30.002
Makes me no difference now
Who you give your thing to

28:30.085 --> 28:34.882
Oh, it's your thing
Do what you wanna do

28:37.092 --> 28:39.595
I can't tell you, bop

28:39.678 --> 28:42.055
Who to sock it to

28:52.191 --> 28:56.153
It's your thing, do what you wanna do

28:56.236 --> 28:57.279
Goodbye!

29:01.992 --> 29:04.161
Miles, Ruby, we need to work.

29:09.750 --> 29:11.001
Did you work on the song?

29:12.586 --> 29:13.754
Good!

29:14.254 --> 29:15.631
Blow my tiny mind.

29:17.132 --> 29:18.300
Three, and...

29:18.383 --> 29:22.054
You're all I need

29:24.640 --> 29:27.351
To get by

29:28.185 --> 29:30.270
Like the sweet morning dew

29:30.354 --> 29:32.397
I took one look at you

29:32.481 --> 29:33.524
And it was--

29:33.607 --> 29:35.734
You did not work on this!

29:35.817 --> 29:36.652
We did.

29:37.486 --> 29:39.947
Just not, like, together.

29:40.030 --> 29:41.490
Dios mio!

29:42.074 --> 29:43.367
"Du-et."

29:43.450 --> 29:44.952
It's in the word!

29:45.410 --> 29:47.663
You must DU-ET together!

29:49.289 --> 29:50.666
Face each other.

29:50.749 --> 29:52.292
Come on, face each other!

29:54.586 --> 29:55.629
You're afraid of her.

29:55.712 --> 29:57.047
You're wise.

29:58.215 --> 29:59.842
Come on, he doesn't have piojos.

30:00.467 --> 30:02.970
Guys! This is not
the Pledge of Allegiance!

30:03.053 --> 30:05.973
It's a love song. A love song!

30:06.557 --> 30:10.561
Try to imagine what it's like
to sacrifice everything for another human.

30:11.353 --> 30:12.688
OK?

30:13.730 --> 30:14.857
So, again?

30:15.649 --> 30:16.775
No.

30:17.276 --> 30:18.861
Of course, again!

30:19.570 --> 30:21.196
You go first, Miles. OK?

30:21.280 --> 30:24.700
Let's take it from the verse. Ready?

30:26.368 --> 30:28.871
Like the sweet morning dew

30:28.954 --> 30:31.164
I took one look at you

30:31.248 --> 30:33.250
And it was plain to see

30:33.333 --> 30:34.793
You were my destiny

30:34.877 --> 30:35.878
Ruby!

30:35.961 --> 30:38.005
With my arms open wide

30:38.088 --> 30:40.424
I threw away my pride

30:40.507 --> 30:42.634
I'll sacrifice for you

30:42.718 --> 30:44.553
Dedicate my life to you

30:44.636 --> 30:46.930
I will go where you lead

30:47.014 --> 30:48.932
Always there in time of need

30:49.016 --> 30:49.892
Together.

30:49.975 --> 30:52.102
And when I lose my will

30:52.186 --> 30:54.313
You'll be there to push me up the hill

30:54.396 --> 30:58.901
There's no, no looking back for us

30:58.984 --> 31:00.694
We got love sure enough...

31:00.777 --> 31:03.030
Good, good, good. Stop, stop, stop!
Good, good, good.

31:03.113 --> 31:06.825
In the chorus, try the harmony up. Go...

31:06.909 --> 31:08.869
There's no, no looking...

31:08.952 --> 31:10.579
Back for us

31:11.538 --> 31:12.956
-Cool.
-Got it? Good!

31:13.040 --> 31:14.374
I am not angry at this.

31:14.458 --> 31:15.709
Go work and come back.

31:15.792 --> 31:17.461
-All right.
-Thank you.

31:18.837 --> 31:20.255
Try it on the guitar.

31:20.339 --> 31:22.216
OK, I'll work on it.

31:29.515 --> 31:30.516
You can sing.

31:32.351 --> 31:36.480
I mean, you have no control,
but your tone is lovely.

31:36.563 --> 31:37.648
Thanks.

31:38.774 --> 31:40.692
It's my favorite thing.

31:44.029 --> 31:45.572
What are you doing next year?

31:45.656 --> 31:46.657
I don't know.

31:47.616 --> 31:49.034
Working with my dad.

31:50.202 --> 31:51.578
No college?

31:51.662 --> 31:53.121
I'm not good at school.

31:56.333 --> 31:59.837
Miles is auditioning
for Berklee College of Music.

31:59.920 --> 32:02.089
I've been coaching him for his audition.

32:03.924 --> 32:06.426
What? You don't know Berklee?

32:07.553 --> 32:08.971
I've heard of it.

32:09.054 --> 32:10.055
Come on!

32:10.138 --> 32:12.766
I grew up in Mexico City,
and even I knew Berklee.

32:13.433 --> 32:15.310
Abe Laboriel,
the famous bassist, went there.

32:15.394 --> 32:17.062
I did too.

32:17.688 --> 32:19.398
I can't afford school.

32:20.107 --> 32:21.733
They have scholarships.

32:29.575 --> 32:31.410
How do you feel when you sing?

32:38.083 --> 32:39.793
I don't know.

32:40.836 --> 32:42.629
It's hard to explain.

32:45.465 --> 32:46.633
Try.

33:36.808 --> 33:39.853
You would need to sight-read
and learn a classical piece.

33:40.979 --> 33:43.106
I need your nights and weekends.

33:43.899 --> 33:45.859
I do not waste my time.

33:46.318 --> 33:47.819
So if I'm offering,

33:48.654 --> 33:50.614
it's because I hear something.

34:10.050 --> 34:12.094
I joined the choir.

34:14.346 --> 34:15.347
Why?

34:16.389 --> 34:18.766
I like to sing.

34:25.565 --> 34:26.775
What?

34:30.195 --> 34:32.739
You're a teenager.

34:36.784 --> 34:39.788
If I was blind, would you want to paint?

34:41.915 --> 34:43.958
Why is it always about you?

34:44.668 --> 34:47.754
I'm meeting people. I'm making friends.

34:49.672 --> 34:51.341
You know what?

34:51.425 --> 34:53.677
You should get out in the world too.

34:53.760 --> 34:54.803
Hey!

35:16.825 --> 35:18.702
We should do a co-op.

35:19.244 --> 35:21.955
Look, there's empty warehouses everywhere.

35:22.497 --> 35:25.709
We could organize a business.

35:25.792 --> 35:28.253
Get the other boats on board.

35:28.337 --> 35:29.379
How?

35:29.463 --> 35:31.423
Who's gonna support us?

35:31.840 --> 35:34.176
We're the deaf guys!

35:35.761 --> 35:39.097
They look at us like we're a joke.

35:39.181 --> 35:41.850
Hey! I'm going to Pratty's
for a brew. Who wants to go?

35:41.934 --> 35:43.143
-I'm in!
-I'm in!

35:45.229 --> 35:46.271
I'm gonna go with them.

35:46.355 --> 35:48.524
You want me to text Ruby?

35:48.607 --> 35:49.942
No.

35:50.359 --> 35:52.736
I'm a grown man!

35:54.071 --> 35:55.656
Come on, kid!

36:00.410 --> 36:02.037
Hooks his arm around the pole...

36:02.120 --> 36:04.081
Bear hugging it.

36:04.665 --> 36:06.583
But when he does, he loses his pants.

36:06.667 --> 36:07.918
They go down to his knees.

36:08.001 --> 36:09.419
No word of a lie!

36:09.503 --> 36:10.796
There he is hanging

36:10.879 --> 36:13.257
with his milky white,
ginger ass hanging out.

36:13.882 --> 36:16.093
He's still thirty feet from the pole!

36:19.221 --> 36:20.764
But of course, he's shit-faced.

36:21.765 --> 36:23.141
Shocker!

36:29.606 --> 36:31.650
I'm good! Crashing into shit!

36:34.403 --> 36:36.196
Oh, shit!

36:38.657 --> 36:40.701
Yeah? What is that?

36:42.536 --> 36:44.371
-Don't...
-Get out of my face.

36:45.539 --> 36:48.166
Get out of my face, freak!

36:49.168 --> 36:51.003
Don't, don't!

36:59.469 --> 37:03.182
Take it outside! Take it outside!

37:03.265 --> 37:05.267
Let's get out of here!

37:13.358 --> 37:16.111
Want some ice for your eye?

37:23.243 --> 37:24.411
Yeah, yeah.

38:43.907 --> 38:46.743
At least they support you,
right? Your music?

38:46.827 --> 38:49.246
Well, my dad insists
guitar is a waste of time

38:49.329 --> 38:51.498
because it's not a true string instrument.

38:51.582 --> 38:53.250
They suck the fun right out of it.

38:55.544 --> 38:58.881
I'm sorry about all this.
My house is kind of gross.

38:58.964 --> 39:00.424
It's cool.

39:08.724 --> 39:10.851
No way! The Shaggs?

39:11.310 --> 39:13.645
I'm really just here
to steal these ladies.

39:18.025 --> 39:19.651
God!

39:20.068 --> 39:21.945
I can't believe this actually works!

39:22.029 --> 39:23.405
It sounds like shit.

39:23.488 --> 39:25.115
But so does my stereo.

39:26.241 --> 39:27.993
My mom thought it was a waste of money.

39:28.076 --> 39:30.162
It was $2 from Goodwill.

39:30.662 --> 39:32.247
Do they, like...

39:32.331 --> 39:36.001
Do they, like, even get what music is?

39:36.627 --> 39:39.546
My dad really likes
gangster rap 'cause of the bass.

39:45.594 --> 39:48.639
When we were little,
I used to see you guys in town.

39:49.139 --> 39:51.517
Yeah. We were hard to miss.

39:51.600 --> 39:54.895
There was this one time--
I think it was, like, 3rd grade--

39:55.521 --> 39:56.897
you were at the Seaport Grill,

39:56.980 --> 39:59.399
and you were ordering for your parents.

39:59.483 --> 40:03.737
And you were talking to the waiter
like a total baller.

40:03.820 --> 40:06.406
And then you ordered two beers.

40:06.490 --> 40:08.075
I thought it was so cool.

40:08.575 --> 40:09.618
Really?

40:11.745 --> 40:12.996
Yeah.

40:13.080 --> 40:15.499
My parents wouldn't even
let me ride the bus by myself.

40:16.250 --> 40:17.251
They're weird.

40:17.334 --> 40:19.711
And they hate each other, so there's that.

40:25.801 --> 40:28.804
So, how should we do this?

40:29.680 --> 40:30.681
Stand?

40:31.640 --> 40:33.517
Yeah, maybe we should, like,

40:33.600 --> 40:35.561
I don't know, sing to each other.

40:47.114 --> 40:51.618
You're all I need

40:54.496 --> 40:58.166
To get by

40:58.250 --> 41:00.919
Like the sweet morning dew

41:01.003 --> 41:03.547
I took one look at you

41:03.630 --> 41:05.799
And it was plain to see

41:05.883 --> 41:07.926
You were my destiny

41:08.635 --> 41:11.013
With my arms open wide

41:11.096 --> 41:13.182
I threw away my pride

41:13.265 --> 41:14.600
I'll sac--

41:14.683 --> 41:16.602
I'm sorry. Yeah, I'm sorry.

41:16.685 --> 41:18.270
This is super weird.

41:19.104 --> 41:20.105
OK.

41:20.189 --> 41:21.565
I don't know where to look.

41:23.901 --> 41:27.029
Well, do you want to try,
like, going back to back?

41:27.112 --> 41:28.447
Yeah, please.

41:29.031 --> 41:30.532
All right.

41:37.998 --> 41:42.503
You're all I need

41:45.339 --> 41:48.509
To get by

41:48.592 --> 41:51.637
Like the sweet morning dew

41:51.720 --> 41:54.181
I took one look at you

41:54.598 --> 41:56.558
And it was plain to see

41:56.642 --> 41:59.394
You were my destiny

41:59.478 --> 42:01.813
With my arms open wide

42:01.897 --> 42:04.274
I threw away my pride

42:04.358 --> 42:06.735
I'll sacrifice for you

42:06.818 --> 42:09.446
Dedicate my life to you

42:09.530 --> 42:11.990
I will go where you lead

42:12.074 --> 42:14.493
Always there in time of need

42:14.576 --> 42:16.828
And when I lose my will

42:16.912 --> 42:19.540
You'll be there to push me up the hill

42:19.623 --> 42:24.503
There's no, no looking back for us

42:24.586 --> 42:28.882
We got love sure enough, that's enough

42:28.966 --> 42:31.093
You're all

42:31.176 --> 42:36.181
All that I need to get by

42:40.352 --> 42:42.855
Like an eagle protects his nest

42:42.938 --> 42:45.315
For you I'll do my best

42:45.399 --> 42:47.484
Stand by you like a tree

42:47.568 --> 42:50.070
And dare anybody to try to move me

42:50.153 --> 42:52.739
Darling, in you I found

42:52.823 --> 42:55.117
Strength when I was torn down

42:55.617 --> 42:57.661
Don't know what's in store

42:57.744 --> 43:00.372
But together we can open any door

43:00.455 --> 43:02.457
Just to do what's good for you

43:02.541 --> 43:03.876
Inspire you...

43:05.210 --> 43:06.253
What's that?

43:09.173 --> 43:10.424
Is that your mom?

43:13.635 --> 43:14.803
Is she OK?

43:39.620 --> 43:42.372
We need to discuss this.

43:43.457 --> 43:44.583
No, we don't.

43:44.666 --> 43:46.460
We had no idea you were home.

43:47.044 --> 43:49.922
The doctor said you're not even
supposed to have sex!

43:50.339 --> 43:52.382
Look at your mother!

43:52.466 --> 43:54.134
Hot!

43:55.052 --> 43:58.388
How am I supposed to control myself?

43:58.472 --> 43:59.890
Maybe I should go.

44:00.307 --> 44:01.308
Sit.

44:02.518 --> 44:03.519
OK.

44:04.228 --> 44:07.523
I want to know what your intentions are.

44:07.606 --> 44:09.107
Dad, no.

44:09.191 --> 44:11.485
You two have to use condoms, okay?

44:13.737 --> 44:15.989
Put a helmet on that soldier.

44:38.178 --> 44:40.097
Oh my God! Miles, go!

44:41.515 --> 44:43.100
You guys are the worst!

44:43.517 --> 44:45.894
-Nice to meet you!
-Just please go.

44:50.899 --> 44:52.401
I hate you!

45:02.244 --> 45:03.662
Honestly, good for them.

45:03.745 --> 45:06.123
I don't think my mom's
had sex since my dad left.

45:06.748 --> 45:09.042
Actually, that's not true.
Her divorce attorney.

45:10.794 --> 45:12.713
It was so embarrassing.

45:13.172 --> 45:15.299
I can't ever see him again.

45:15.382 --> 45:16.633
Pizza.

45:17.843 --> 45:19.094
I think it's fine.

45:19.178 --> 45:21.180
He's probably already forgotten about it.

45:25.642 --> 45:27.603
It's very cold.

45:59.635 --> 46:00.719
Hey, Ruby!

46:00.802 --> 46:01.887
Get away from me!

46:01.970 --> 46:03.889
Wait! I didn't do that, OK?
I didn't tell them.

46:03.972 --> 46:04.973
Yes, you did.

46:05.057 --> 46:07.893
No. No, I didn't. I told Jay, one person.

46:08.894 --> 46:10.395
Come on... We were laughing.

46:10.479 --> 46:11.730
I thought it was funny.

46:44.012 --> 46:45.222
-They shake their heads
-Breathe!

46:45.305 --> 46:48.392
They say I've changed

46:48.475 --> 46:50.978
While something's lost

46:51.061 --> 46:53.564
But something's gained

46:53.647 --> 46:54.731
Breathe!

46:54.815 --> 46:58.485
In living every day

46:58.569 --> 47:00.279
I've looked at life

47:00.362 --> 47:01.947
No, let it out! Let it out!

47:02.030 --> 47:04.366
-From both sides now
-Don't hold it!

47:04.449 --> 47:06.618
-From...
-Don't hold it!

47:06.702 --> 47:07.911
Ruby, no!

47:07.995 --> 47:10.789
If you're gonna pick Joni Mitchell,
you gotta sing it.

47:10.873 --> 47:13.500
-This is one of the great songs.
-Yeah, I know.

47:14.668 --> 47:16.420
You either find a way to connect to it

47:16.503 --> 47:18.297
or pick a different song.

47:18.380 --> 47:19.673
OK, come on!

47:19.756 --> 47:21.008
Shake your body! Shake it!

47:21.091 --> 47:22.092
Shake your arms. Come on!

47:23.260 --> 47:25.929
Now, sing back at me.

47:26.013 --> 47:29.766
Mi, mi, mi, mi!

47:29.850 --> 47:30.851
Come on!

47:30.934 --> 47:32.728
Mi, mi, mi, mi!

47:32.811 --> 47:34.438
No, no, you're holding it!

47:34.521 --> 47:36.899
-I'm not!
-Yeah! You're trying to sound pretty!

47:36.982 --> 47:38.525
-I'm not!
-Yes, you are.

47:40.319 --> 47:41.320
OK.

47:42.237 --> 47:44.239
You said when you started school,

47:44.323 --> 47:45.782
you talked funny.

47:47.075 --> 47:48.243
Funny how?

47:50.245 --> 47:51.663
I talked like a deaf person.

47:51.747 --> 47:53.707
What does a deaf person sound like?

47:55.209 --> 47:56.251
You know.

47:56.335 --> 47:57.836
No, no. I don't know.

47:57.920 --> 47:59.588
I want you to tell me.

48:01.381 --> 48:02.216
Different.

48:02.299 --> 48:03.717
Different how?

48:03.800 --> 48:06.220
Like, wrong. Ugly.

48:06.303 --> 48:07.387
"Ugly." OK.

48:07.471 --> 48:09.223
Make an ugly sound for me.

48:09.306 --> 48:11.683
-What?
-Come on! Yeah.

48:11.767 --> 48:14.353
You think you were the only kid
who ever got bullied,

48:14.436 --> 48:16.355
who ever had a funny accent?

48:16.438 --> 48:17.856
Look in my eyes!

48:17.940 --> 48:19.900
Push against my hands as hard as you can.

48:20.943 --> 48:22.152
Push, push!

48:22.236 --> 48:23.278
Look at me!

48:23.362 --> 48:26.240
Make the ugliest, grossest sound
you can. Come on!

48:30.953 --> 48:32.037
No! Be a monster!

48:37.292 --> 48:38.460
Now sing at me!

48:38.544 --> 48:41.129
I've looked at life

48:41.213 --> 48:43.590
From both sides now

48:43.674 --> 48:46.009
From win and lose

48:46.093 --> 48:48.637
And still somehow

48:48.720 --> 48:51.181
Yes! That's it.

48:51.265 --> 48:52.891
That's it!

48:52.975 --> 48:55.310
That's what I was waiting for. Hey!

48:57.729 --> 48:58.730
Yes!

49:00.065 --> 49:02.860
-Give me a break!
-You guys raise the quotas every year.

49:02.943 --> 49:05.404
There used to be 100 boats in that harbor.
There must be 15 now.

49:05.487 --> 49:07.865
Yeah, what are you doing?
Taking kickbacks from the government?

49:07.948 --> 49:11.076
You want to control the fish, but you
don't know what's going on out there!

49:11.159 --> 49:12.619
That's the point of the monitors!

49:12.703 --> 49:16.623
-Right, a snitch!
-Hey, settle down. Settle down!

49:16.707 --> 49:18.208
Let's be respectful.

49:18.292 --> 49:20.335
We're out there to collect data!

49:20.419 --> 49:23.172
Yeah, well, your data is wrong, OK?

49:23.755 --> 49:25.007
Sorry.

49:25.090 --> 49:26.550
You gotta interpret. I'm lost.

49:26.633 --> 49:27.759
You've tested?

49:27.843 --> 49:30.637
Yeah! I see what's coming up
in my nets, you asshole.

49:32.306 --> 49:34.933
We understand that the observers

49:35.017 --> 49:36.685
are a financial hardship.

49:36.768 --> 49:37.978
Really?

49:38.061 --> 49:40.355
But it's critical to protect the fishery.

49:41.190 --> 49:43.400
It's John's job to look out for the fish!

49:43.483 --> 49:46.904
And as head of the council,
it's my job to look out for you!

49:46.987 --> 49:48.280
Bullshit!

49:49.573 --> 49:50.741
Like hell it is.

49:50.824 --> 49:52.451
It's not the old days anymore.

49:52.534 --> 49:56.163
Everyone has to make some sacrifices here.

49:58.373 --> 50:01.043
Guys, we're not the enemy here.

50:16.892 --> 50:17.976
"Suck my dick!"

50:21.104 --> 50:22.940
That's from him, not me.

50:23.941 --> 50:26.360
Got a problem, Frank?

50:34.660 --> 50:36.328
"We're tired of this shit, Gio!"

50:36.411 --> 50:37.579
Yeah!

50:37.663 --> 50:40.332
"You don't care if these guys
regulate us to death...

50:42.292 --> 50:44.378
'cause you're the only one
making money here."

50:48.173 --> 50:50.467
"No one's getting paid
what their catch is worth."

50:54.054 --> 50:56.557
"My dad fished and his dad.

50:57.641 --> 50:59.852
So I'm gonna fight like hell
to stay out on the water."

50:59.935 --> 51:00.978
Yeah!

51:06.066 --> 51:07.818
"Screw yourself!"

51:08.944 --> 51:10.404
"I'm done with the auction."

51:10.487 --> 51:13.198
Yeah? What are you gonna do?

51:23.667 --> 51:25.419
"We're gonna sell our own fish."

51:25.502 --> 51:27.796
Yeah.

51:27.880 --> 51:29.631
"Any of you wanna join us?"

51:29.715 --> 51:30.924
Hey, what is this?

51:35.053 --> 51:38.223
"You like giving this asshole
60% of your paycheck?"

51:39.975 --> 51:42.853
"Bring us your catch,
and we'll double what you're getting now."

51:45.480 --> 51:46.523
Double it?

51:46.982 --> 51:49.276
I have no idea.
It sounded good though, right?

51:52.154 --> 51:53.614
What?

51:56.491 --> 51:58.243
It just came out.

51:58.535 --> 51:59.620
I was in the moment.

51:59.703 --> 52:02.122
How would that even work?

52:02.456 --> 52:06.210
We get customers to sign up.
They buy fish right off the boat.

52:07.920 --> 52:12.299
Do you know how much work that is?
There are so many steps!

52:12.799 --> 52:14.551
I've looked into it.

52:16.261 --> 52:17.971
There's no money for it.

52:18.055 --> 52:20.390
You do our books.

52:20.474 --> 52:22.226
You could work with the other wives.

52:23.477 --> 52:25.771
Those hearing bitches
want nothing to do with me.

52:25.854 --> 52:28.690
Maybe if you didn't call them
"hearing bitches"?

52:29.107 --> 52:30.817
And you! You hate people!

52:32.194 --> 52:34.279
We could finally be part
of this community.

52:34.947 --> 52:36.073
We have our community.

52:36.156 --> 52:37.324
Who?

52:37.407 --> 52:38.825
Your deaf friends?

52:38.909 --> 52:40.536
You see them once a month.

52:41.828 --> 52:44.331
What's the problem? It's a great idea!

52:46.792 --> 52:49.294
We can't talk to these people.

53:32.588 --> 53:35.716
Breaking rocks in the hot sun

53:35.799 --> 53:39.386
I fought the law and the law won

53:39.469 --> 53:41.638
I fought the law and the law won

53:41.722 --> 53:45.309
I needed money 'cause I had none

53:45.392 --> 53:48.145
I fought the law and the law won

53:48.228 --> 53:50.439
Get your fresh catch here!

53:51.356 --> 53:53.567
Sign up now,
and get fish right off the boat!

53:54.318 --> 53:56.028
Ocean to your mouth!

53:56.111 --> 53:57.988
I guess my race is run

53:58.071 --> 54:01.033
She's the best girl that I ever had

54:01.116 --> 54:03.785
I fought the law and the law won

54:03.869 --> 54:06.038
Forte. Very loudly, fortissimo.

54:06.121 --> 54:09.208
Softly, piano, very softly, pianissimo.

54:34.942 --> 54:36.151
Hey!

54:37.486 --> 54:38.987
Ruby, come on! I said I'm sorry.

54:39.571 --> 54:40.572
You're late.

54:40.656 --> 54:42.533
I fought the law and the law won

54:42.616 --> 54:45.327
I fought the law and the law won

54:45.410 --> 54:48.497
I left my baby, and it feels so bad

54:48.580 --> 54:51.208
I guess my race is run

54:51.708 --> 54:55.170
She's the best girl that I ever had

54:55.254 --> 54:58.382
I fought the law and the law won

54:58.465 --> 55:00.551
I fought the law and the

55:01.593 --> 55:04.888
I fought the law and the law won

55:17.359 --> 55:20.195
I fought the law and the law won

55:20.279 --> 55:22.573
I fought the law and the law won

55:22.656 --> 55:26.118
I fought the law and the

55:26.201 --> 55:27.953
Get your ass inside!

55:31.123 --> 55:33.458
I'm sorry. I'm gonna
have to call you back.

55:39.673 --> 55:42.092
That's the third time you're late!

55:42.176 --> 55:43.844
It's only 20 minutes!

55:43.927 --> 55:45.637
I don't care if it's one minute!

55:45.721 --> 55:48.473
It shows me that you don't
respect me or my time.

55:48.557 --> 55:49.933
I have a lot going on!

55:50.017 --> 55:51.602
Me too! Me too!

55:51.685 --> 55:54.646
I have a whole life
that has nothing to do with you.

55:54.730 --> 55:58.442
If you waste my time,
I will not work with you.

56:01.195 --> 56:02.237
OK?

56:02.321 --> 56:03.405
OK.

56:04.406 --> 56:05.866
I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

56:06.325 --> 56:07.659
It better not.

56:07.743 --> 56:09.077
It won't.

56:09.161 --> 56:10.162
OK.

56:23.091 --> 56:25.511
You gonna avoid me until we graduate?

56:26.094 --> 56:29.306
I wasn't laughing at them
for being deaf, OK?

56:29.389 --> 56:30.599
It was the situation.

56:30.682 --> 56:31.683
OK.

56:32.351 --> 56:35.270
Look, I know it's not an excuse,
but it sucks at my house right now,

56:35.354 --> 56:37.189
and you've got this,
like, perfect life, and--

56:37.272 --> 56:38.690
What?

56:38.774 --> 56:40.192
Your parents are madly in love.

56:40.275 --> 56:41.985
They can't keep their hands
off each other.

56:42.069 --> 56:43.445
-And your house is--
-Disgusting.

56:43.529 --> 56:45.030
My house is disgusting.

56:45.113 --> 56:46.949
It's not, OK? It's a home.

56:47.032 --> 56:49.243
And you all work together and laugh.

56:49.326 --> 56:51.328
And my family's not like that.

56:51.411 --> 56:53.539
And then, I listen to you sing, and...

56:55.040 --> 56:57.459
I just do it 'cause it's expected from me.

56:58.168 --> 57:01.129
You have no idea what it's like
to hear people laugh at your family.

57:01.755 --> 57:02.798
You're right. I don't.

57:02.881 --> 57:05.634
And have to protect them,
'cause they can't hear it, but I can.

57:05.717 --> 57:06.718
I know.

57:07.553 --> 57:09.763
I'm sorry, Ruby. I am.

57:13.809 --> 57:14.935
I'm a dick.

57:15.018 --> 57:18.689
Can I make it up to you? Please!

57:18.772 --> 57:21.525
I'll text you every few minutes
until you agree to hang out with me!

57:21.608 --> 57:22.776
That's psychotic!

57:23.527 --> 57:25.487
OK, I will not do that!

57:26.989 --> 57:28.448
I'm not gonna do that.

57:32.119 --> 57:33.871
These foodie people will eat anything now:

57:33.954 --> 57:36.748
heads, tails, all sorts of garbage.

57:36.832 --> 57:39.835
Next thing you know,
fish dick's gonna be the new delicacy.

57:40.335 --> 57:41.420
Fish don't have dicks.

57:42.421 --> 57:44.423
This is your last free batch, kid.

57:44.506 --> 57:45.549
Yeah, I got you.

57:45.632 --> 57:47.551
My fingers are falling off.

57:50.762 --> 57:52.764
I can't fit all these in the car.

57:53.432 --> 57:54.766
We need a truck.

57:55.976 --> 57:57.811
Where are you going?

57:58.228 --> 57:59.730
I have my music practice.

58:00.189 --> 58:01.523
You can't go.

58:06.069 --> 58:07.154
What's this?

58:07.237 --> 58:09.072
The news!

58:09.156 --> 58:10.866
They're doing a story on the family!

58:12.201 --> 58:13.202
Now?

58:14.244 --> 58:15.370
I can't.

58:17.581 --> 58:19.041
How are we gonna do the interview?

58:19.124 --> 58:20.459
I can lip read.

58:20.542 --> 58:21.919
You're not going to get all of it!

58:22.002 --> 58:23.003
This is important.

58:23.086 --> 58:24.421
My stuff is important too!

58:24.505 --> 58:25.672
Do it!

58:25.756 --> 58:27.591
I can't!

58:28.759 --> 58:30.636
You want us to fail?

58:42.523 --> 58:45.275
Hi! You must be Jackie Rossi!

58:45.359 --> 58:46.360
Chet Turner!

58:48.529 --> 58:50.531
"Hopefully, people will support us

58:50.614 --> 58:52.366
and will buy their fish here."

58:52.783 --> 58:57.371
That's great!
So, how does this program work?

58:59.665 --> 59:03.335
Basically, the fishermen are
at the mercy of the big guys.

59:14.054 --> 59:16.598
The goal is to sell fish
directly to the people.

59:42.958 --> 59:44.334
Mr. V!

59:46.378 --> 59:47.754
Mr. V!

1:00:22.331 --> 1:00:23.916
Is that yours?

1:00:31.465 --> 1:00:32.883
I'm sorry.

1:00:34.134 --> 1:00:35.802
I want to do this.

1:00:40.349 --> 1:00:41.934
I don't think so.

1:00:42.851 --> 1:00:44.353
Are you serious?

1:00:46.522 --> 1:00:48.065
You have no discipline.

1:00:48.148 --> 1:00:50.734
You're late. You're unprepared.

1:00:51.652 --> 1:00:53.445
You wouldn't last two days at Berklee.

1:00:54.780 --> 1:00:56.907
Out! Go!

1:00:58.283 --> 1:01:00.786
Well, it's not like that school
did you any good.

1:01:04.957 --> 1:01:08.752
You have, what, 17 years on this planet?

1:01:09.294 --> 1:01:10.629
You don't know shit.

1:01:11.296 --> 1:01:13.090
You want to know why I'm a teacher?

1:01:13.173 --> 1:01:14.967
I'm good at this.

1:01:15.050 --> 1:01:17.845
But I can't do my job unless you do yours.

1:01:18.595 --> 1:01:20.639
And I certainly don't need
a lesson in failure

1:01:20.722 --> 1:01:23.600
from someone who's too afraid to even try.

1:01:31.942 --> 1:01:35.195
I've never done anything
without my family before.

1:01:45.747 --> 1:01:47.916
I want to go to college.

1:01:48.584 --> 1:01:49.626
At Berklee.

1:01:52.087 --> 1:01:53.589
Music school.

1:01:55.215 --> 1:01:58.010
My teacher's been helping me
with my audition.

1:02:00.220 --> 1:02:02.806
College? In Boston?

1:02:03.348 --> 1:02:05.642
That city is full of assholes.

1:02:06.101 --> 1:02:07.394
So is everywhere.

1:02:07.853 --> 1:02:09.563
You can't go now.

1:02:09.646 --> 1:02:11.231
We just started the business. With you!

1:02:11.315 --> 1:02:13.442
That's all you care about?

1:02:14.193 --> 1:02:16.445
Losing your free interpreter?

1:02:16.528 --> 1:02:20.449
You're an important part of this.

1:02:21.408 --> 1:02:22.826
It's terrible timing.

1:02:22.910 --> 1:02:25.746
There will never be a good time.

1:02:26.455 --> 1:02:29.583
I can't stay with you
for the rest of my life!

1:02:29.666 --> 1:02:33.879
Nobody expects that from you.

1:02:34.379 --> 1:02:35.547
I...

1:02:36.048 --> 1:02:39.134
have been interpreting my whole life.

1:02:41.261 --> 1:02:43.722
This is exhausting.

1:02:47.726 --> 1:02:49.937
Singing is what I love.

1:02:51.897 --> 1:02:53.357
It's everything.

1:02:58.987 --> 1:03:00.739
Did you know about this?

1:03:10.707 --> 1:03:12.417
We can't let her go.

1:03:13.752 --> 1:03:15.462
It's college.

1:03:16.004 --> 1:03:17.005
It's not.

1:03:17.089 --> 1:03:18.674
It's music school.

1:03:20.217 --> 1:03:23.512
And what if she can't sing?

1:03:24.555 --> 1:03:26.181
Maybe she's awful.

1:03:26.598 --> 1:03:27.933
She's not awful.

1:03:28.016 --> 1:03:29.351
Really? Have you heard her?

1:03:32.980 --> 1:03:35.315
I'm worried. What if she fails?

1:03:36.358 --> 1:03:37.484
I'm tired.

1:03:37.568 --> 1:03:39.152
I don't wanna talk anymore.

1:03:45.826 --> 1:03:48.370
What do we do if she gets in?

1:03:49.580 --> 1:03:50.956
Then she's gone.

1:03:51.707 --> 1:03:53.417
Our baby's gone!

1:03:54.459 --> 1:03:56.128
She's not a baby.

1:03:56.211 --> 1:03:57.212
She's my baby!

1:03:57.296 --> 1:03:58.714
She was never a baby.

1:04:45.969 --> 1:04:46.970
Where is Ruby?

1:04:47.846 --> 1:04:48.889
She's pissed.

1:04:48.972 --> 1:04:50.349
Yeah, but today?

1:04:53.435 --> 1:04:55.437
Is that the observer, seriously?

1:04:57.064 --> 1:04:58.148
Hello!

1:04:58.524 --> 1:04:59.942
I should make her jump.

1:05:02.277 --> 1:05:04.363
I'm Joanne Biles. I'm your at-sea monitor.

1:05:04.446 --> 1:05:06.365
I'll be coming out with you today.

1:05:13.205 --> 1:05:16.083
Could you help me with...
I don't think I can get across.

1:05:19.628 --> 1:05:20.671
Thanks.

1:05:34.184 --> 1:05:36.770
It feels like it could be
rough seas today!

1:05:58.917 --> 1:06:01.545
Should I throw her overboard?

1:06:09.720 --> 1:06:12.639
So, you gonna murder me?

1:06:12.723 --> 1:06:14.224
I haven't decided.

1:06:25.027 --> 1:06:26.236
Really?

1:06:27.279 --> 1:06:28.280
No. No, no, no.

1:06:28.363 --> 1:06:29.489
Just don't belly flop.

1:06:36.622 --> 1:06:38.457
-Come on!
-Are you crazy?

1:06:45.047 --> 1:06:46.089
That looks freezing.

1:06:46.173 --> 1:06:47.591
Get in!

1:06:48.926 --> 1:06:50.052
Clear!

1:06:50.385 --> 1:06:51.553
Incoming!

1:06:55.098 --> 1:06:56.683
God, it's so cold!

1:06:57.434 --> 1:06:59.019
It went up my nose!

1:07:08.320 --> 1:07:10.531
So, we good now?

1:07:12.824 --> 1:07:14.535
After we do the barge.

1:07:16.161 --> 1:07:18.455
Which one's the barge?

1:07:21.291 --> 1:07:23.293
Wait, that's, like, 40 feet.

1:07:23.377 --> 1:07:24.378
Yep!

1:07:37.975 --> 1:07:40.769
Hey, is the engine regularly maintained?

1:07:41.270 --> 1:07:43.689
When was the last time
that you had your engine checked?

1:07:44.273 --> 1:07:47.526
Yeah, it's loud. That's why I'm asking.

1:08:06.753 --> 1:08:08.589
Him too?

1:08:31.569 --> 1:08:33.322
Haven't kids, like, died doing this?

1:08:33.779 --> 1:08:35.365
It'll definitely flip
your eyelids inside out

1:08:35.448 --> 1:08:37.492
and give you the worst
wedgie of your life.

1:08:37.576 --> 1:08:38.618
OK...

1:08:39.828 --> 1:08:42.872
Your legs are gonna start
shaking, like, cartoon style.

1:08:42.956 --> 1:08:46.001
So jump fast to save yourself.

1:08:46.502 --> 1:08:48.127
OK...

1:08:48.795 --> 1:08:51.965
And there's a branch sticking out
about halfway down, so jump out.

1:08:53.341 --> 1:08:54.885
You're really selling this.

1:08:57.513 --> 1:08:59.096
Is that poison ivy?

1:09:03.519 --> 1:09:05.145
Holy shit!

1:09:06.438 --> 1:09:07.481
OK...

1:09:09.566 --> 1:09:10.943
Should we leave a note

1:09:11.026 --> 1:09:13.028
in case people think it's a joint suicide?

1:09:13.654 --> 1:09:15.279
Nah, let's keep 'em guessing.

1:09:19.451 --> 1:09:22.120
Yeah, there's the shaky legs.

1:09:25.207 --> 1:09:26.500
OK.

1:09:26.959 --> 1:09:28.877
One, two...

1:09:28.961 --> 1:09:30.295
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

1:09:31.046 --> 1:09:32.296
Three! Saving myself!

1:09:35.676 --> 1:09:36.676
No!

1:09:40.346 --> 1:09:41.932
Yeah! That hurt.

1:09:50.858 --> 1:09:52.609
Fishing vessel Angela Rose.

1:09:52.693 --> 1:09:54.695
Fishing vessel Angela Rose. Coast guard.

1:09:54.778 --> 1:09:57.322
25 off your starboard quarter.
Channel 16, over.

1:09:59.825 --> 1:10:02.327
Fishing vessel Angela Rose.
Fishing vessel Angela Rose.

1:10:02.411 --> 1:10:05.247
Coast guard. 25, E21. 25, E21.

1:10:05.330 --> 1:10:07.958
Channel 16. Come in. Over.

1:10:14.923 --> 1:10:17.301
Fishing vessel Angela Rose.
Fishing vessel Angela Rose.

1:10:17.384 --> 1:10:20.387
Coast guard. 25, E21. 25, E21.

1:10:20.470 --> 1:10:22.347
Come in. Over.

1:10:24.474 --> 1:10:27.352
Fishing vessel Angela Rose.
Fishing vessel Angela Rose.

1:10:27.436 --> 1:10:29.730
Coast guard 25. You are in violation of...

1:10:37.821 --> 1:10:38.989
You, sir! Sir, stand up!

1:10:39.072 --> 1:10:41.825
Drop the pick. Stand up!
Stand up! What's going on here?

1:10:41.909 --> 1:10:44.244
Why is no one answering the radio?

1:11:08.936 --> 1:11:09.937
Nailed it.

1:11:12.189 --> 1:11:13.315
No!

1:11:15.526 --> 1:11:17.110
-No!
-No, no!

1:11:19.488 --> 1:11:20.864
Check it out!

1:11:23.617 --> 1:11:24.743
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1:11:35.587 --> 1:11:36.880
Yeah! No!

1:12:28.056 --> 1:12:29.057
What happened?

1:12:30.517 --> 1:12:32.644
You didn't come to work.

1:12:32.728 --> 1:12:34.563
We're done fishing.

1:12:34.646 --> 1:12:36.481
They suspended my license.

1:12:37.566 --> 1:12:38.734
Who?

1:12:39.526 --> 1:12:40.527
Coasties.

1:12:40.611 --> 1:12:43.739
The observer saw we were deaf
and tipped them off.

1:12:44.156 --> 1:12:46.033
Well, they can't do that.

1:12:46.116 --> 1:12:47.910
We were just working

1:12:47.993 --> 1:12:50.913
and they came to board us. We didn't know.

1:12:50.996 --> 1:12:52.122
I told you.

1:12:52.206 --> 1:12:53.415
You need a hearing deckhand.

1:12:54.625 --> 1:12:56.084
Yeah, that's you!

1:12:56.168 --> 1:12:57.211
You were that person!

1:12:57.294 --> 1:12:59.505
I can't always be that person!

1:12:59.963 --> 1:13:01.840
She's right. We need another guy.

1:13:01.924 --> 1:13:03.091
We can't afford it!

1:13:05.302 --> 1:13:08.305
If you'd told me you weren't coming,

1:13:08.388 --> 1:13:10.766
I'd have figured something out.
But you didn't.

1:13:11.475 --> 1:13:13.393
You're seriously blaming me?

1:13:14.228 --> 1:13:16.230
Your father was counting on you.

1:13:20.317 --> 1:13:23.111
No. Don't put this on me.

1:13:25.447 --> 1:13:27.533
It's not my fault.

1:13:34.373 --> 1:13:37.584
You failed to obey an order
by federal law enforcement

1:13:37.668 --> 1:13:39.336
to board your vessel.

1:13:39.920 --> 1:13:42.881
On top of that,
you were operating your vessel

1:13:42.965 --> 1:13:45.676
in a negligent and dangerous manner

1:13:45.759 --> 1:13:48.470
due to your... disability.

1:13:49.972 --> 1:13:55.185
I have no choice but to administer
the minimum fine, which is $1,000,

1:13:55.644 --> 1:13:59.773
and an additional penalty of $1,500.

1:14:04.695 --> 1:14:09.283
We can't pay that unless
we can get back on the water.

1:14:09.950 --> 1:14:12.494
Officer, what do they need
to do to be able to fish again?

1:14:13.787 --> 1:14:17.291
You will be required
to have a hearing individual

1:14:17.374 --> 1:14:19.877
on board at all times

1:14:19.960 --> 1:14:23.797
to answer radios,
hear ship whistles, etcetera.

1:14:24.506 --> 1:14:28.510
We will be monitoring you regularly
to make sure you are in compliance.

1:14:29.595 --> 1:14:31.471
Do you have that person?

1:14:53.785 --> 1:14:56.038
I'll sell the boat.

1:14:56.121 --> 1:15:00.209
Take the money we can. That'll be that.

1:15:01.168 --> 1:15:02.419
It's fine.

1:15:03.086 --> 1:15:04.546
I'll stay.

1:15:05.714 --> 1:15:07.883
I'll work with you on the boat.

1:15:07.966 --> 1:15:09.510
No!

1:15:09.593 --> 1:15:10.677
Yes.

1:15:10.761 --> 1:15:12.804
We can't afford to pay someone else.

1:15:14.890 --> 1:15:17.809
And there's nobody that's
gonna know how to sign.

1:15:19.478 --> 1:15:20.812
Are you sure?

1:15:21.480 --> 1:15:23.190
School can wait.

1:15:25.234 --> 1:15:27.194
I already decided.

1:15:28.612 --> 1:15:30.072
I'm excited.

1:15:34.952 --> 1:15:37.079
Oh, Saint Ruby!

1:15:37.162 --> 1:15:39.373
We'll make a shrine to you on the boat.

1:15:39.456 --> 1:15:40.415
Wait!

1:15:40.499 --> 1:15:41.500
She's trying to help!

1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:43.669
Well, thank God you have her.

1:16:08.902 --> 1:16:10.821
Don't kill me.

1:16:12.573 --> 1:16:18.495
I bought you a red dress for your concert.

1:16:24.168 --> 1:16:26.837
If you don't like it,
you don't have to wear it.

1:16:31.633 --> 1:16:34.386
I'm really glad you're staying.

1:16:37.222 --> 1:16:38.640
Leo isn't.

1:16:39.641 --> 1:16:40.976
It's complicated.

1:16:41.351 --> 1:16:42.686
He feels...

1:16:43.395 --> 1:16:44.521
left out.

1:16:45.564 --> 1:16:46.899
That's crazy.

1:16:48.233 --> 1:16:50.652
It's always the three of you

1:16:50.736 --> 1:16:51.945
and then me.

1:16:55.449 --> 1:16:57.075
I get it.

1:17:07.002 --> 1:17:10.714
Do you ever wish I was deaf?

1:17:24.019 --> 1:17:27.564
When you were born, at the hospital,

1:17:28.774 --> 1:17:31.443
they gave you a hearing test.

1:17:33.070 --> 1:17:37.407
And there you were, so tiny and sweet,

1:17:39.326 --> 1:17:42.204
with these electrodes all over you.

1:17:44.164 --> 1:17:46.667
And I...

1:17:47.459 --> 1:17:50.504
prayed that you would be deaf.

1:17:53.048 --> 1:17:55.676
When they told us

1:17:55.759 --> 1:17:57.469
that you were hearing,

1:17:58.679 --> 1:18:00.222
I felt...

1:18:01.431 --> 1:18:03.517
My heart sank.

1:18:03.600 --> 1:18:04.768
Why?

1:18:05.727 --> 1:18:09.147
I was worried that we wouldn't connect.

1:18:09.731 --> 1:18:11.859
Like me and my mom,

1:18:11.942 --> 1:18:13.485
we're not close.

1:18:14.903 --> 1:18:17.906
I thought I would fail you.

1:18:18.574 --> 1:18:21.451
That being deaf would make me a bad mom.

1:18:26.790 --> 1:18:27.958
Don't worry.

1:18:28.667 --> 1:18:30.252
You are a bad mom

1:18:31.003 --> 1:18:33.130
for so many other reasons.

1:18:36.717 --> 1:18:39.845
I know I drive you crazy

1:18:39.928 --> 1:18:42.598
with the clothes, the makeup.

1:18:49.897 --> 1:18:51.648
But honestly,

1:18:51.732 --> 1:18:55.194
I'm happy that you know who you are.

1:18:57.988 --> 1:18:59.489
You're brave.

1:18:59.948 --> 1:19:01.533
Not like me.

1:19:46.662 --> 1:19:47.746
Get lost.

1:19:48.413 --> 1:19:49.498
You hiding?

1:19:50.499 --> 1:19:52.376
Not very well.

1:19:57.214 --> 1:19:58.215
You still mad at me?

1:20:00.050 --> 1:20:02.052
You can't fish full-time.

1:20:02.135 --> 1:20:03.136
Why not?

1:20:05.556 --> 1:20:07.057
Gertie told me

1:20:07.140 --> 1:20:08.976
that you can really sing.

1:20:09.476 --> 1:20:11.311
That's special.

1:20:12.396 --> 1:20:13.981
You can't stay here.

1:20:14.606 --> 1:20:17.734
They'll keep looking to you
for everything.

1:20:17.818 --> 1:20:19.820
What else am I supposed to do?

1:20:20.946 --> 1:20:22.114
Let me do this!

1:20:22.197 --> 1:20:23.407
I got this!

1:20:23.490 --> 1:20:25.242
I'm the older brother.

1:20:25.325 --> 1:20:27.244
And I get treated like a baby.

1:20:27.327 --> 1:20:29.872
I haven't been able to do a thing
with Fresh Catch!

1:20:29.955 --> 1:20:31.957
Because it all involves
talking to hearing people!

1:20:32.040 --> 1:20:33.917
So what? Who cares!

1:20:34.001 --> 1:20:36.962
You're so afraid that we'd look stupid.

1:20:37.045 --> 1:20:39.673
Let them figure out how to deal
with deaf people!

1:20:40.174 --> 1:20:42.885
We're not helpless.

1:20:45.804 --> 1:20:49.474
Our family was fine before you were born.

1:20:53.187 --> 1:20:54.563
Go.

1:21:04.781 --> 1:21:07.743
Come on. This is... We're not at Fenway.

1:21:20.005 --> 1:21:22.925
OK, guys, you must be ready
to walk onstage in two minutes,

1:21:23.008 --> 1:21:25.052
or you're not performing, OK?

1:21:29.932 --> 1:21:31.350
Ruby.

1:21:37.189 --> 1:21:39.274
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen!

1:21:39.358 --> 1:21:41.318
For those of you who don't know,

1:21:41.401 --> 1:21:44.530
I'm Bernardo Villalobos, the choir master.

1:21:45.030 --> 1:21:46.156
Can you read his lips?

1:21:46.240 --> 1:21:47.699
Most of these kids
call me Mr. V to my face.

1:21:47.783 --> 1:21:48.825
Not really.

1:21:49.535 --> 1:21:51.578
I don't know what they
call me behind my back.

1:21:52.996 --> 1:21:54.164
But I'm very proud of this group.

1:21:54.248 --> 1:21:56.291
They laughed.

1:21:56.375 --> 1:21:57.751
They worked very hard.

1:21:57.835 --> 1:22:02.965
So I will shut up now
and let you see your children,

1:22:03.048 --> 1:22:04.716
which is what you came for.

1:22:21.608 --> 1:22:24.903
Ain't got no troubles in my life

1:22:25.988 --> 1:22:28.407
Ruby looks beautiful.

1:22:28.490 --> 1:22:30.200
No foolish dreams to make me cry

1:22:30.284 --> 1:22:32.578
You have good taste.

1:22:32.661 --> 1:22:34.246
I'm never frightened or worried

1:22:34.329 --> 1:22:37.541
I like how her red dress
matches the curtains.

1:22:37.624 --> 1:22:42.087
I know I'll always get by

1:22:42.963 --> 1:22:44.965
-I heat up
-Heat up

1:22:45.048 --> 1:22:47.176
-I cool down
-Cool down

1:22:47.259 --> 1:22:50.596
When something gets
In my way, I go round it

1:22:51.471 --> 1:22:54.391
Don't let life get me down

1:22:54.474 --> 1:22:55.851
She's good.

1:22:57.561 --> 1:22:59.646
-She's good.
-No idea.

1:22:59.730 --> 1:23:01.857
-No, she said.
-Oh!

1:23:09.031 --> 1:23:11.033
I got the music in me

1:23:11.116 --> 1:23:13.243
I got the music in me

1:23:13.327 --> 1:23:16.371
I got the music in me

1:23:21.376 --> 1:23:24.630
They say that life is a circle

1:23:24.713 --> 1:23:27.591
But that ain't the way that I found it

1:23:27.674 --> 1:23:29.176
I found it

1:23:29.259 --> 1:23:32.679
Gonna move in a straight line

1:23:33.388 --> 1:23:37.935
I leaned back on my radio

1:23:38.018 --> 1:23:41.688
Some cat was laying down
Some rock and roll

1:23:41.772 --> 1:23:43.732
"Lotta soul," he said

1:23:50.906 --> 1:23:51.907
What's wrong?

1:23:52.574 --> 1:23:54.034
My buttons are off.

1:23:54.535 --> 1:23:56.328
That weren't no DJ

1:23:56.411 --> 1:23:59.414
That was hazy cosmic jive

1:24:01.917 --> 1:24:04.044
What do you want for dinner?

1:24:04.753 --> 1:24:08.215
-Spaghetti.
-I'll have to go to the grocery store.

1:24:08.298 --> 1:24:10.467
He'd like to come and meet us

1:24:10.551 --> 1:24:12.719
But he thinks he'll blow our minds

1:24:12.803 --> 1:24:17.057
There's a starman waiting in the sky

1:24:18.225 --> 1:24:19.852
He's told us not to blow it

1:24:19.935 --> 1:24:22.354
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile

1:24:22.437 --> 1:24:25.399
He told me, "Let the children lose it

1:24:25.482 --> 1:24:28.110
"Let the children use it

1:24:28.193 --> 1:24:31.405
Let all the children boogie"

1:25:12.446 --> 1:25:15.449
And now I have a special treat.

1:25:15.532 --> 1:25:19.244
Sometimes, you hear a voice, and
it reminds you to keep making music.

1:25:19.328 --> 1:25:22.039
First song done, second song done.

1:25:22.122 --> 1:25:26.627
Please welcome Miles Patterson
and Ruby Rossi!

1:25:49.942 --> 1:25:54.655
You're all I need

1:25:57.407 --> 1:26:00.536
To get by

1:26:00.869 --> 1:26:03.580
Like the sweet morning dew

1:26:03.664 --> 1:26:05.916
I took one look at you

1:26:05.999 --> 1:26:10.379
And it was plain to see
You were my destiny

1:26:11.296 --> 1:26:13.674
With my arms open wide

1:26:13.757 --> 1:26:15.759
I threw away my pride

1:26:16.426 --> 1:26:18.595
I'll sacrifice for you

1:26:18.679 --> 1:26:21.014
Dedicate my life to you

1:26:21.098 --> 1:26:23.851
I will go where you lead...

1:27:32.878 --> 1:27:34.546
Go, Ruby!

1:27:48.101 --> 1:27:50.521
Hey, Ruby! That was so lovely!

1:27:50.604 --> 1:27:51.605
Thanks!

1:27:51.688 --> 1:27:53.023
Bob!

1:27:54.816 --> 1:27:56.360
Great job! Great, great job!

1:27:56.443 --> 1:27:57.611
Thank you.

1:27:57.694 --> 1:27:59.196
Are these your parents?

1:27:59.279 --> 1:28:02.199
Yeah, Frank and Jackie.
And this is my brother, Leo.

1:28:03.033 --> 1:28:08.205
This is my teacher, Mr. V. And his family.

1:28:10.499 --> 1:28:11.667
Nice to fuck you.

1:28:13.335 --> 1:28:14.795
I learned that on YouTube.

1:28:18.507 --> 1:28:21.718
What? Isn't that, "Nice to meet you"?

1:28:22.511 --> 1:28:23.512
No.

1:28:24.304 --> 1:28:28.475
"Meet" is one finger, not two.
See? This is, like, the legs.

1:28:28.559 --> 1:28:29.643
No!

1:28:29.726 --> 1:28:30.978
No, no, no! I mean...

1:28:31.061 --> 1:28:32.396
Oh my God!

1:28:32.479 --> 1:28:33.981
It's fine. I get it.

1:28:35.023 --> 1:28:36.942
Nice to screw you too.

1:28:40.737 --> 1:28:42.489
These are my kind of parents.

1:28:44.283 --> 1:28:45.409
Please tell them:

1:28:45.492 --> 1:28:47.661
"Their daughter is very talented.

1:28:49.246 --> 1:28:52.708
And they're making a terrible mistake
not sending her off to school."

1:28:53.917 --> 1:28:55.586
I'll just sign the first part.

1:28:55.669 --> 1:28:58.922
I'm meeting Miles at his audition
tomorrow. You still have your slot.

1:28:59.006 --> 1:29:00.883
-What is he saying?
-You have to stop.

1:29:00.966 --> 1:29:02.551
OK, OK.

1:29:02.634 --> 1:29:04.386
But thank you.

1:29:31.371 --> 1:29:34.833
I'm gonna get some air.

1:29:35.334 --> 1:29:36.502
Okay.

1:29:48.889 --> 1:29:50.807
What's up?

1:29:52.392 --> 1:29:54.311
Just thinking.

1:29:58.023 --> 1:30:02.236
The stars here,

1:30:02.319 --> 1:30:07.241
they don't look as good as
they do on the water.

1:30:22.089 --> 1:30:27.469
The song you sang tonight.
What was it about?

1:30:33.934 --> 1:30:35.978
It was about...

1:30:37.688 --> 1:30:41.108
what it is to need another person.

1:30:44.236 --> 1:30:48.282
Can you sing it for me?

1:30:49.283 --> 1:30:50.492
Now?

1:30:50.576 --> 1:30:52.160
Please.

1:31:03.755 --> 1:31:06.675
Like the sweet morning dew

1:31:08.594 --> 1:31:12.431
I took one look at you

1:31:13.432 --> 1:31:16.810
And it was plain to see

1:31:16.894 --> 1:31:20.522
You were my destiny

1:31:21.690 --> 1:31:24.735
With my arms open wide

1:31:24.818 --> 1:31:28.947
Louder. More!

1:31:29.031 --> 1:31:32.075
I'll sacrifice for you

1:31:32.159 --> 1:31:36.455
Dedicate my life to you

1:31:37.831 --> 1:31:41.210
I will go where you lead

1:31:41.293 --> 1:31:44.463
Always there in time of need

1:31:44.546 --> 1:31:48.050
And when I lose my will

1:31:48.133 --> 1:31:50.969
You'll be there to push me up the hill

1:31:51.053 --> 1:31:53.180
There's no

1:31:53.639 --> 1:31:58.769
No looking back for us

1:31:58.852 --> 1:32:03.023
We got love sure enough

1:32:03.106 --> 1:32:04.983
That's enough

1:32:05.275 --> 1:32:07.736
You're all

1:32:08.028 --> 1:32:11.949
All that I need

1:32:14.785 --> 1:32:18.247
To get by

1:32:51.071 --> 1:32:52.447
Are we fishing?

1:32:52.531 --> 1:32:53.532
No.

1:33:10.215 --> 1:33:12.301
You guys, this is ridiculous!

1:33:12.593 --> 1:33:16.597
If we're kicking you out,
we're all doing it as a family.

1:33:40.204 --> 1:33:42.122
Maybe over there?

1:33:59.348 --> 1:34:01.058
I'm gonna park.

1:34:08.774 --> 1:34:10.859
Look how they're dressed.

1:34:10.943 --> 1:34:12.486
It's so different.

1:34:13.070 --> 1:34:15.531
It's fine. You look pretty.

1:34:16.990 --> 1:34:18.492
Hey! I'm here for my audition.

1:34:18.575 --> 1:34:19.493
OK! What's your name?

1:34:19.576 --> 1:34:21.078
Ruby Rossi.

1:34:22.746 --> 1:34:24.915
It looks like you're
about half an hour late.

1:34:24.998 --> 1:34:26.416
Are you ready to go?

1:34:29.086 --> 1:34:30.587
We roll deep.

1:34:30.921 --> 1:34:32.965
I'm sorry. Your family
can't go in with you.

1:34:34.216 --> 1:34:35.592
What did she say?

1:34:36.093 --> 1:34:37.553
You can't go in.

1:34:48.480 --> 1:34:49.481
Ruby!

1:34:49.565 --> 1:34:50.566
Hey!

1:34:50.649 --> 1:34:51.525
You came!

1:34:51.608 --> 1:34:52.776
Is Mr. V here?

1:34:52.860 --> 1:34:55.362
He just left. I can call him.

1:34:55.445 --> 1:34:57.865
I texted him. How did it go?

1:34:59.491 --> 1:35:01.034
I choked.

1:35:01.118 --> 1:35:02.160
What?

1:35:02.244 --> 1:35:03.662
Ruby Rossi?

1:35:17.968 --> 1:35:19.386
Hello there!

1:35:19.469 --> 1:35:20.512
Hi.

1:35:21.138 --> 1:35:22.890
You are...

1:35:22.973 --> 1:35:25.392
Ruby. Ruby Rossi.

1:35:27.352 --> 1:35:29.146
OK, Ruby Rossi.

1:35:29.980 --> 1:35:31.857
Looking at your application,

1:35:31.940 --> 1:35:34.610
aside from your involvement
in the school choir

1:35:34.693 --> 1:35:38.530
and a very nice letter
from Bernardo Villalobos,

1:35:39.114 --> 1:35:41.909
you don't have a lot
of history with music.

1:35:47.164 --> 1:35:49.291
I don't under-- Is there a question?

1:35:59.635 --> 1:36:03.263
Let's go upstairs.

1:36:13.857 --> 1:36:16.151
What is your first song today?

1:36:16.735 --> 1:36:18.737
Both Sides, Now by Joni Mitchell.

1:36:18.820 --> 1:36:20.489
Do you have your sheet music?

1:36:23.742 --> 1:36:25.827
I don't. I forgot.

1:36:28.539 --> 1:36:30.415
Do you know that song?

1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:35.087
All right. You are just going
to have to sing it a cappella.

1:36:37.840 --> 1:36:38.841
OK.

1:36:40.759 --> 1:36:42.594
I can accompany her.

1:36:44.054 --> 1:36:46.306
Sorry for interrupting. Hi!

1:36:47.432 --> 1:36:48.642
How are you?

1:36:48.725 --> 1:36:52.646
I'm Bernardo Villalobos, class of '89.

1:36:53.355 --> 1:36:54.398
Nice to see you all.

1:36:55.774 --> 1:36:57.568
May I?

1:36:59.862 --> 1:37:01.363
I guess so.

1:37:01.446 --> 1:37:03.198
Thank you.

1:37:03.282 --> 1:37:04.491
What is going on?

1:37:23.886 --> 1:37:29.099
Rows and flows of angel hair

1:37:29.183 --> 1:37:34.771
And ice cream castles in the air

1:37:35.272 --> 1:37:37.107
And feather can--

1:37:42.070 --> 1:37:43.780
Sorry. My mistake.

1:37:47.034 --> 1:37:48.827
Can we take it from the top?

1:38:10.307 --> 1:38:15.270
Rows and flows of angel hair

1:38:15.354 --> 1:38:21.109
And ice cream castles in the air

1:38:21.193 --> 1:38:26.865
And feather canyons everywhere

1:38:27.616 --> 1:38:30.911
I've looked at clouds that way

1:38:33.330 --> 1:38:37.668
But now they only block the sun

1:38:37.751 --> 1:38:43.757
They rain and snow on everyone

1:38:43.841 --> 1:38:49.972
So many things I would have done

1:38:50.055 --> 1:38:55.477
But clouds got in my way

1:38:56.019 --> 1:39:00.232
I've looked at clouds
From both sides now

1:39:00.858 --> 1:39:03.777
From up and down

1:39:03.861 --> 1:39:06.488
And still somehow

1:39:06.572 --> 1:39:12.119
It's cloud illusions I recall

1:39:12.202 --> 1:39:17.833
I really don't know clouds

1:39:21.879 --> 1:39:23.714
At all

1:39:27.342 --> 1:39:32.055
Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels

1:39:32.139 --> 1:39:37.394
The dizzy dancing way you feel

1:39:37.477 --> 1:39:43.901
As every fairy tale comes real

1:39:43.984 --> 1:39:47.946
I've looked at love that way

1:39:49.781 --> 1:39:54.328
But now it's just another show

1:39:54.411 --> 1:40:00.209
You leave 'em laughing when you go

1:40:00.292 --> 1:40:06.340
And if you care, don't let 'em know

1:40:06.673 --> 1:40:11.929
Don't give yourself away

1:40:12.012 --> 1:40:16.517
I've looked at love
From both sides now

1:40:16.600 --> 1:40:20.187
From give and take

1:40:20.270 --> 1:40:22.314
And still somehow

1:40:23.106 --> 1:40:28.529
It's love's illusions I recall

1:40:28.612 --> 1:40:33.909
I really don't know love

1:40:38.121 --> 1:40:39.498
At all

1:40:43.252 --> 1:40:48.674
Tears and fears and feeling proud

1:40:48.757 --> 1:40:54.304
To say, "I love you," right out loud

1:40:54.388 --> 1:40:59.643
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds

1:41:00.644 --> 1:41:05.649
I've looked at life that way

1:41:06.441 --> 1:41:11.113
But now old friends
They're acting strange

1:41:11.196 --> 1:41:16.702
They shake their heads
They say I've changed

1:41:16.785 --> 1:41:23.083
Well, something's lost
But something's gained

1:41:23.166 --> 1:41:27.629
In living every day

1:41:27.713 --> 1:41:33.552
I've looked at life
From both sides now

1:41:33.635 --> 1:41:39.183
From win and lose, and still somehow

1:41:39.266 --> 1:41:44.646
It's life's illusions I recall

1:41:44.730 --> 1:41:50.736
I really don't know life

1:41:52.487 --> 1:41:58.785
I've looked at life
From both sides now

1:41:58.869 --> 1:42:03.832
From up and down, and still somehow

1:42:03.916 --> 1:42:09.963
It's life's illusions I recall

1:42:10.047 --> 1:42:14.718
I really don't know life

1:42:32.569 --> 1:42:34.279
Visit me in Boston?

1:42:38.492 --> 1:42:39.535
I don't know.

1:42:39.618 --> 1:42:42.329
You know, you're probably gonna
run off with some cello player

1:42:42.412 --> 1:42:43.830
who wears a fedora.

1:42:45.749 --> 1:42:47.334
Yeah, probably.

1:43:05.143 --> 1:43:06.144
Ready?

1:43:06.228 --> 1:43:07.688
Ready.

1:43:10.357 --> 1:43:11.441
All right!

1:43:13.610 --> 1:43:16.989
Three, two, one...

1:43:26.999 --> 1:43:29.126
You sure you don't want us to come?

1:43:29.209 --> 1:43:32.546
-We can help set up your dorm room?
-No, no! Let's not make this a thing.

1:43:37.718 --> 1:43:40.053
Bye-bye, ass monkey.

1:43:40.554 --> 1:43:42.264
Bye, shit nugget.

1:43:56.486 --> 1:43:57.487
Stop...

1:44:28.435 --> 1:44:30.145
Wait, wait, wait! Stop, stop!

1:44:59.883 --> 1:45:01.009
Go!
