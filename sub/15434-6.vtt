Previously on "Brothers and Sisters"

00:00.880 --> 00:03.240
I'm Amber. I'm your new intern.

00:03.240 --> 00:04.990
You slept with her.

00:04.990 --> 00:07.800
The $12 million? 
Put in back in the fund by the end of the year.

00:07.800 --> 00:10.190
Where are we gonna find $12 million?

00:10.190 --> 00:11.600
We find out where Dad put it.

00:11.600 --> 00:13.420
Somebody has to know where that money is.

00:13.420 --> 00:15.410
I can refer you to a forensic accountant.

00:15.410 --> 00:16.680
If you want to leave, Nora...

00:16.681 --> 00:18.470
Why? Just because my brother is over there

00:18.470 --> 00:20.460
with the woman who was sleeping with my husband?

00:20.460 --> 00:23.150
For a long time, I didn't know about you and William,

00:23.150 --> 00:25.400
so many secrets he only shared with you.

00:25.400 --> 00:26.440
Hey, boss.

00:26.440 --> 00:28.940
We used to know each other. San Marino High.

00:28.940 --> 00:33.470
I like you, and I feel completely and totally out of my league.

00:34.150 --> 00:36.300
And the hardest thing is knowing when to give up.

00:36.300 --> 00:37.720
Jonathan?

00:37.720 --> 00:39.340
He's gone.

00:52.290 --> 00:53.920
It's tantric.

00:53.920 --> 00:57.030
It's exactly like...it is yoga.

00:57.030 --> 00:59.700
Please don't...talk. Don't move.

00:59.700 --> 01:02.660
If you move, something really bad could happen.

01:02.660 --> 01:05.300
Like what?
- Don't talk! Just hold it.

01:05.300 --> 01:07.270
Oh my God! I'm gonna pull a hamstring.

01:07.270 --> 01:10.270
This is the most uncomfortable position ever!

01:10.270 --> 01:13.280
I promised one of my TTC friends I'd try it.

01:14.550 --> 01:16.770
You have to move...!
- Shhh.

01:16.770 --> 01:18.950
God!
- (laughing)

01:20.080 --> 01:21.750
OK!

01:22.230 --> 01:25.390
Oh, Julia, there's gotta be an easier way to make a baby!

01:25.390 --> 01:26.500
God!

01:26.500 --> 01:28.840
What's TTC, anyway?

01:28.840 --> 01:31.440
"Trying To Conceive." It's online.

01:31.440 --> 01:34.060
And this is what you talk about in your chatrooms?

01:34.060 --> 01:38.240
With strangers? Do I need to put a block on the computer?

01:38.240 --> 01:40.580
You ready for round two?

01:40.580 --> 01:43.190
Actually, no. We don't have any time, we gotta go.

01:43.190 --> 01:44.750
We've gotta get over to Sarah's.
- Uh-huh.

01:46.070 --> 01:47.930
You're not going anywhere.

01:52.040 --> 01:53.110
Dude, thanks for coming.

01:53.110 --> 01:55.370
Sorry! Sorry we're late everyone.
- OK, come on.

01:55.370 --> 01:58.210
We don't have much time to take control of the situation.

01:58.210 --> 02:01.210
And we have to stick together. That's the most important thing.

02:01.210 --> 02:03.760
We should go on a road trip and, like, vanish into the desert.

02:03.760 --> 02:07.080
Yeah, for a year, which is how long it'll take for Mom to stop being mad at us.

02:07.080 --> 02:10.630
No, we have to stop this now or it will go on for the rest of our lives.

02:10.630 --> 02:11.680
What is the big deal?

02:11.680 --> 02:14.800
This is a benefit for the Pasadena Children's Hospital, for God's sakes.

02:14.800 --> 02:16.480
(moaning)

02:16.480 --> 02:18.100
That's not the problem. It's Mom.

02:18.100 --> 02:20.490
And the night is staggeringly long!

02:20.490 --> 02:23.500
We have to be this nauseatingly perfect smiling family

02:23.500 --> 02:25.170
until, like, four in the morning. It's awful.

02:25.170 --> 02:26.650
You're lucky you haven't been to one of these.

02:26.650 --> 02:29.390
Just talk to her, guys. Tell her you don't wanna go this year.

02:29.390 --> 02:31.310
I agree. What's the worst that can happen?

02:31.670 --> 02:33.640
Do you know what a War Crimes Tribunal looks like?

02:33.640 --> 02:35.220
I had to go to war to get out of it!

02:35.220 --> 02:37.740
She practically called the White House to get me back for the night.

02:37.740 --> 02:40.460
Look, Sarah's right. We stick together, we're fine,

02:40.460 --> 02:42.370
but if anybody cracks, we're sunk.

02:42.370 --> 02:45.270
You know, I was kinda looking forward to it this year,

02:45.270 --> 02:48.510
you know? The theme is "Back to Broadway" and who doesn't love a musical?

02:48.780 --> 02:50.160
- You are gay!
- What? So?

02:50.160 --> 02:51.910
Listen, no one is going to this thing.

02:51.910 --> 02:54.430
The company has to foot the bill and we can't afford it.

02:55.810 --> 02:59.650
We just can't be throwing money around right now.

03:02.760 --> 03:05.160
OK, so, I'm gonna tell Mom.

03:05.500 --> 03:09.300
All you guys have to do is hold your ground.

03:09.720 --> 03:15.580
The tyranny of Nora's Big Night is over!

03:16.130 --> 03:17.580
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

03:17.580 --> 03:19.740
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

03:20.020 --> 03:22.620
What do you think the chances are that I'm gonna end up living with Mom

03:22.620 --> 03:25.950
and 18 orange cats for the rest of my life?

03:25.950 --> 03:27.060
3 to1.
- Hmm.

03:29.820 --> 03:33.810
So, this, ah... thing that you are talking about,

03:33.810 --> 03:36.560
about how the company is paying for the benefit and not....

03:36.560 --> 03:39.020
Yeah. Look, times are tough.

03:39.390 --> 03:42.480
We've had to make some big decisions, sell off a few divisions.

03:42.480 --> 03:44.580
A few divisons? Wow!

03:45.450 --> 03:47.520
Well, that would be tough times.

03:47.520 --> 03:50.760
Yeah, it was all stuff Dad was preparing to do,

03:50.760 --> 03:54.870
he just.... never got around to it.

03:55.830 --> 03:58.530
Well, is the company gonna be OK?

03:58.530 --> 04:01.830
It won't be the company we grew up with, but it will be fine.

04:04.710 --> 04:08.100
Listen, I need to be the one to tell Mom, OK?

04:08.530 --> 04:13.750
When I do, she'll understand why it's best if we don't go to this ridiculous fundraiser thing this year.

04:15.560 --> 04:17.149
These...

04:17.149 --> 04:21.070
financial problems that you're talking about. Did...

04:21.980 --> 04:24.610
Did they have anything to do with Dad?

04:31.590 --> 04:34.380
They're not his fault, if that what you mean.

04:38.560 --> 04:40.530
OK, well, I gotta go.

04:41.690 --> 04:44.180
Let me know how it goes with Mom.

04:44.790 --> 04:46.900
- Good night.
- Night, Baby.

04:46.900 --> 04:49.420
- Thanks for the pizza.
- You're welcome. Drive safe.

04:49.420 --> 04:52.130
Good night. Thanks.

04:55.170 --> 04:57.100
Oh!

04:57.100 --> 04:58.640
You should've told her.

04:58.640 --> 05:01.090
Yeah. "Hey, Sis...

05:01.090 --> 05:03.890
"You know, your father, who you worshipped and adored"

05:03.890 --> 05:05.950
"and still preach about on national television?"

05:05.950 --> 05:08.570
"Well, not only was he an adulterer,"

05:08.570 --> 05:11.620
"He was also an embezzler who stole million of dollars"

05:11.620 --> 05:14.760
"from his employees who worked tirelessly"

05:14.760 --> 05:17.850
"to make him rich in the first place."

05:19.490 --> 05:21.300
Something like that?

05:23.530 --> 05:24.710
Yeah.

05:25.260 --> 05:27.100
We're running out of time!

05:27.100 --> 05:31.620
Ah, finding a replacement Master of Ceremonies 48 hours before the event, that's gonna be impossible.

05:31.620 --> 05:36.650
I have a secret weapon I can tap: a celebrity who's on TV.

05:39.460 --> 05:41.770
Your entire brood is coming this year, huh?

05:41.770 --> 05:44.460
Kitty no longer has 3000 miles as an excuse.

05:44.460 --> 05:47.310
For the first time, all five of my children will be there.

05:47.310 --> 05:50.840
That's why we do it. For the kids. Right?

05:55.890 --> 05:58.070
Would anyone else like some coffee?

05:58.070 --> 06:00.560
I'm in desperate need of caffeine.

06:00.560 --> 06:03.680
Harry, your assistance is required in the kitchen.

06:06.930 --> 06:09.200
You're doing well, aren't you?

06:09.200 --> 06:12.190
I heard you've already started dating.

06:12.190 --> 06:15.050
What was that? Was that supposed to be charming, huh?

06:15.050 --> 06:17.900
Was I supposed to melt when you put your hand on my thigh like that?

06:17.900 --> 06:20.900
Or just enjoy it so much I would forget you're married to my friend...

06:20.900 --> 06:23.460
who happens to be sitting across the table from us?

06:23.460 --> 06:25.910
- I just thought....
- I doubt that, Harry.

06:25.910 --> 06:29.730
And if you did, you thought very, very, very wrong.

06:30.080 --> 06:32.330
I guess I just misinterpreted a signal.

06:32.330 --> 06:35.280
A signal? I sent no signal, Harry. None.

06:35.280 --> 06:37.020
And I did not go out on a date.

06:37.020 --> 06:39.930
The only resemblance it had to a date was how disastrous it was!

06:39.930 --> 06:43.510
Darling? Nora? Is coffee ready?

06:43.510 --> 06:45.460
Coffee's ready.

06:46.160 --> 06:48.300
So, I studied the records you sent me.

06:48.300 --> 06:51.830
William Walker sold his stock to the company pension fund

06:51.830 --> 06:54.280
at an inflated price of $15 million.

06:54.280 --> 06:58.110
Proceeds from that sale went into his personal bank account for less than 24 hours.

06:58.110 --> 06:59.580
Right, and then the money was wired out.

06:59.580 --> 07:01.980
I could never find out where, leaving us at a dead end.

07:01.980 --> 07:03.700
Because you're not a forensic acountant.

07:04.640 --> 07:09.000
The routing number on the outgoing wire transfer is registered to Prescott National,

07:09.000 --> 07:11.070
and that's a bank in Nevada.

07:11.070 --> 07:12.660
And does William have an account there?

07:12.660 --> 07:15.670
No, the money went into an account held by Ricklean & Cabot.

07:15.670 --> 07:17.880
It's a small brokerage firm at Prescott.

07:17.880 --> 07:22.240
So, let me guess, nobody at Ricklean & Cabot knows anything about William or if they do, they're not talking?

07:22.240 --> 07:25.980
The best that I could do was determine the number of the account at R&C.

07:25.980 --> 07:28.060
That's it. There.

07:28.060 --> 07:31.980
Now, they've got a website so clients can view the accounts remotely.

07:31.980 --> 07:37.900
Unfortunately, the trail stops at a password between 5 and 8 characters long

07:37.900 --> 07:40.740
with over a billion possible combinations.

07:41.790 --> 07:42.670
In other words...

07:42.670 --> 07:46.660
In other words, the odds of you ever seeing that money again are dependent upon one thing, Mr. Holden...

07:46.660 --> 07:47.750
What's that?

07:47.750 --> 07:50.010
How well did you know your brother-in-law?

07:52.500 --> 07:54.920
The man fondled me under the table!

07:54.920 --> 07:57.290
Are you sure he didn't graze you?

07:57.290 --> 08:00.320
Cows graze! This was a millimeter from heavy petting and

08:00.320 --> 08:05.700
What have I done to make every member of this family think I'm a psychosexual hysteric?

08:05.700 --> 08:09.970
Apart from misinterpreting a dinner invitation from an employee as a date?

08:09.970 --> 08:11.390
You can't listen to Kitty.

08:11.390 --> 08:14.770
Republicans don't share a close relationship with the truth.

08:14.770 --> 08:16.920
OK, where the ad for the program?

08:16.920 --> 08:20.270
I have the printer saving an entire page for Ojai.

08:20.270 --> 08:24.360
Actually, Mom, Ojai's what I wanna talk to you about.

08:24.890 --> 08:27.290
It's sensitive.

08:27.760 --> 08:29.350
Sarah, I'm your mother.

08:29.350 --> 08:33.480
There's nothing you could tell I wouldn't take completely in stride.

08:33.480 --> 08:36.289
Like when Kitty told you she wanted to campaign for Reagan?

08:36.289 --> 08:40.570
That's different. She was 12. It was a security issue.

08:41.370 --> 08:42.850
Just tell me.

08:44.169 --> 08:45.430
OK, umm

08:46.280 --> 08:48.150
Money's tight.

08:48.150 --> 08:50.450
Sacrifices need to be made.

08:50.450 --> 08:55.970
Well, I know $25,000 a table is very extravagant, but it's an extremely good cause.

08:57.320 --> 08:59.780
Acually, Mom, it's um...

08:59.780 --> 09:00.660
- No...
- It's...

09:00.660 --> 09:02.030
Listen to me, now...

09:02.030 --> 09:05.140
I know that you and your brothers would rather hammer nails into your foreheads
-- mm hmm

09:05.500 --> 09:06.800
than go to this every year,

09:06.800 --> 09:11.000
and ever year, I exert my maternal pressure to get you to go.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.630
- And do you know why?
- Sadism?

09:13.630 --> 09:15.450
Sarah, please, please, just listen to me.

09:15.450 --> 09:17.010
OK.

09:17.990 --> 09:25.080
One night every year, I get to play out this secret fantasy of mine.

09:25.080 --> 09:31.120
I get to look at you all, this perfectly imperfect family that we are

09:31.120 --> 09:33.340
all dressed up and beautiful

09:33.340 --> 09:38.310
and I get to pretend we're that Great American Family

09:38.310 --> 09:42.640
our own version of the Kennedys.

09:42.640 --> 09:44.340
You know how that ended, right?

09:44.340 --> 09:46.540
All right, it's a dumb fantasy.

09:46.540 --> 09:50.000
OK, but it's my fantasy

09:50.000 --> 09:51.490
and I don't know...

09:51.490 --> 09:54.370
with everything that's happened this year,

09:54.370 --> 09:56.430
I just...

09:56.430 --> 09:58.770
I just need it.

10:04.600 --> 10:06.520
$25,000 for the table?

10:06.520 --> 10:08.380
Well, last year, the company gave $30,000

10:08.380 --> 10:09.820
I was thinking $40,000 this year.

10:09.820 --> 10:11.300
$35,000, not $40,000.

10:11.300 --> 10:13.260
$35,000 is good.

10:17.310 --> 10:19.060
- Tommy.
- Hey.

10:19.410 --> 10:21.690
- How are you doing, Doctor?
- Sorry to keep you waiting.

10:21.690 --> 10:23.150
Yeah.

10:23.880 --> 10:26.730
Hey, why'd you need to see me in person?

10:26.730 --> 10:27.780
Is everything OK?

10:27.780 --> 10:30.090
Please have a seat.

10:32.160 --> 10:34.370
When you came in here for your routine physical and

10:34.370 --> 10:38.330
requested we take a semen sample, what was your reason?

10:38.330 --> 10:39.220
What do you mean?

10:39.220 --> 10:42.410
I just wondered if there were symptoms and you were hesitant to tell us.

10:42.410 --> 10:45.560
A lot of the time, men don't like to talk about it.

10:45.560 --> 10:47.730
We want to have a baby.

10:47.730 --> 10:50.220
I figured, we have sex...a lot

10:50.220 --> 10:53.370
and ... I thought it would've taken by now.

10:53.370 --> 10:56.000
So, before I go ask Julia if she can get tested, I

10:56.000 --> 10:59.350
just, I wanted to make sure it wasn't me, you know?

10:59.740 --> 11:03.790
As it happens, Tommy, your body isn't producing any sperm.

11:08.800 --> 11:11.460
There's no easy way to say this, Tommy.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.620
You're sterile.

11:20.970 --> 11:23.520
...lost the interest of an entire nation.

11:23.520 --> 11:26.710
So that's why I can't get a date!

11:28.420 --> 11:30.670
You let him rattle you too much.

11:30.670 --> 11:35.260
Oh! Right...yeah...thanks.

11:35.260 --> 11:36.200
Don't be sarcastic.

11:36.200 --> 11:40.940
Sarcasm is the refuge for people who know they are wrong and are on the ropes.

11:40.940 --> 11:42.630
I'm not on the ropes, Mother.

11:42.630 --> 11:45.470
We have to go shopping. You need a dress for the benefit.

11:45.470 --> 11:47.490
Oh, you know, I have to get to work in a half an hour

11:47.490 --> 11:50.390
and I don't need a dress because I'm not going to the benefit.

11:52.360 --> 11:56.190
Oh, Mother, please don't look at me like I just confessed to a killing spree!

11:56.190 --> 11:58.230
Nobody is going to the event, nobody...

11:58.230 --> 12:01.400
All your brothers and sisters have confirmed.

12:02.060 --> 12:03.990
They did?

12:07.200 --> 12:09.610
Sarah did? She did?

12:09.610 --> 12:12.510
She was the first one. She bought the table.

12:12.950 --> 12:14.260
Kitty, listen to me,

12:14.260 --> 12:18.880
if you're going to insist upon being this anti-social, non-participating,

12:18.880 --> 12:23.070
sad person all the time, people will think you're aloof.

12:23.070 --> 12:26.720
Sarah, Mom totally nailed me! Whatever happened to sticking together?

12:26.720 --> 12:29.150
I am so sorry.

12:29.150 --> 12:31.280
I just, it-it was so hard... she--

12:31.280 --> 12:34.650
she started going on about the Kennedys and it was all over.

12:34.650 --> 12:37.410
Oh, she did not use that Kennedy fantasy on you?

12:37.410 --> 12:40.280
And you fell for it? You schmuck.

12:40.280 --> 12:42.960
She's used that before? Oh, God, she's good.

12:42.960 --> 12:44.600
You know what? You're gonna help me find a dress

12:44.600 --> 12:47.190
and, you know what? I'm tempted to make the company pay for it.

12:47.190 --> 12:49.020
- No, you won't.
- Yes, I will...

12:49.490 --> 12:51.030
Tommy, are you OK?

12:51.030 --> 12:53.100
Yeah, I'm fine.

12:54.290 --> 12:56.780
Oh, Saul, you have to sit with Mom tomorrow night.

12:56.780 --> 12:59.440
You're the only person who can handle her at this thing.

12:59.440 --> 13:00.830
Well, I would, but...

13:00.830 --> 13:05.000
Oh, no, you cannot get out of this, OK? It is your brotherly duty.

13:05.000 --> 13:09.730
Yeah, well, I'll be sitting at a different table this year.

13:11.110 --> 13:12.320
No, don't tell me.

13:12.320 --> 13:15.570
I've asked Holly Harper to attend and I will forego your editorial.

13:15.570 --> 13:16.860
Editorial?

13:16.860 --> 13:20.290
Saul, you're dating my father's mistress.

13:23.450 --> 13:26.210
I can't imagine she's worth it.

13:26.210 --> 13:29.080
I happen to believe that she is very much worth it.

13:32.480 --> 13:34.750
It's not just that you're smart, you're cool.

13:34.750 --> 13:37.990
Like that thing on the Geneva Convention in a moral universe? Wow.

13:39.350 --> 13:42.880
She's right, War. You skewered Kitty like a piece of chicken.

13:43.300 --> 13:45.260
I'm sorry, hello, hi. It's Kitty.

13:45.260 --> 13:47.090
- Hey, how are you?
- Did you say "piece of chicken?"

13:47.090 --> 13:50.900
I meant a tough, insightful chicken.

13:50.900 --> 13:54.540
I have to go do, the...uh...something.

13:55.300 --> 13:57.430
I thought you were both fantastic.

13:57.430 --> 13:58.450
Have a great weekend, Kitty.

13:58.450 --> 14:00.320
You, too.

14:00.980 --> 14:03.070
Actually, I was looking for you.

14:03.070 --> 14:04.720
I was, ah, I was looking for you, too.

14:04.720 --> 14:05.480
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:05.480 --> 14:08.100
- Do you wanna go first?
- No, I think you should.

14:08.100 --> 14:12.010
OK. Um... are you free tomorrow night?

14:12.010 --> 14:14.860
Well, there's this-this event that my mother is organizing,

14:14.860 --> 14:17.470
It's dreadful. It's full of old monied people.

14:17.470 --> 14:18.870
And you want me to work the door?

14:18.870 --> 14:21.500
No, I want you to come with me.

14:22.240 --> 14:23.200
As in be your date?

14:23.200 --> 14:25.090
As in a platonic, no hand on my knee,

14:25.090 --> 14:28.680
I'll open my own door, placeholder kind of date, but yes

14:28.970 --> 14:31.390
my date, nonetheless.

14:31.840 --> 14:33.660
It wouldn't be appropriate.

14:34.510 --> 14:38.070
I'm sorry. Did you just say that it wouldn't be appropriate?

14:38.070 --> 14:40.120
I've started seeing someone.

14:40.720 --> 14:43.050
Really? Oh..wow.

14:43.920 --> 14:46.570
The point is, even if we went and had a good time,

14:46.570 --> 14:48.640
I wouldn't be able to sleep with you.

14:48.640 --> 14:51.520
Oh, no, that's not the point, Warren,

14:51.520 --> 14:53.460
because I didn't ask you to sleep with me.

14:53.460 --> 14:56.020
I just asked you to a stupid benefit.

14:56.020 --> 14:59.030
And you know what? I take it back.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.650
Hey, hey! How are you?

15:03.650 --> 15:06.100
We are gonna rock the house, Girlfriend!

15:06.100 --> 15:09.560
You know, it-it's kind of stuffy, and pretentious

15:09.560 --> 15:12.660
but, um, the drinks and free, and um...

15:13.050 --> 15:15.440
It's an excuse to dress up.

15:15.440 --> 15:18.640
Sadly, I can't. I'm ...

15:18.640 --> 15:20.470
I'm actually working that event.

15:20.470 --> 15:22.360
- You're kidding.
- I wish I were.

15:22.360 --> 15:24.510
Well, can-can you get someone to fill in?

15:24.510 --> 15:27.790
It's not that. It's--It's kind of a lot of money, Kevin.

15:27.790 --> 15:31.350
Oh, OK. How much do you make on a night like that? Two, three hundred max?

15:31.350 --> 15:34.150
You know...I-I could reimburse you for lost wages.

15:34.150 --> 15:35.640
I'm truthfully a little insulted.

15:35.640 --> 15:38.150
Oh, oh, come on, that's--that's not what I meant,

15:38.150 --> 15:41.900
You know, it's...it's...it's just kind of a big deal for me, you know?

15:41.900 --> 15:44.500
My whole family will be there and I would...

15:44.500 --> 15:48.410
I would like to have you sitting next to me, you know, not serving ajai on toast.

15:48.410 --> 15:50.690
- Now I am officially insulted.
- Oh, stop being so...

15:50.690 --> 15:53.550
Stop being so what? You offered to pay me to be your date.

15:53.550 --> 15:54.640
It's not even your primary job, Scotty.

15:54.640 --> 15:56.430
Whether it's my day job or my night job doesn't matter.

15:56.430 --> 15:59.980
I'm a cater-waiter. You're going out with a cater-waiter. And unlike you,

15:59.980 --> 16:02.190
I actually take it seriously.

16:05.400 --> 16:07.620
Paige, Cooper, I'll be right back.

16:07.620 --> 16:09.730
Don't do that! Ow! Stop it!

16:10.100 --> 16:12.970
- You kids alright?
- Fine. Sorry, Grandma.

16:15.940 --> 16:18.430
Hey, Nora. Wow, you look great.

16:18.430 --> 16:19.520
Thanks.

16:19.520 --> 16:20.580
They give you much trouble?

16:20.580 --> 16:22.700
No. I like it when they destroy things.

16:22.700 --> 16:25.810
It reminds me not to be too attached to material objects.

16:27.870 --> 16:29.060
Has it been that bad?

16:29.060 --> 16:31.760
They're my grandkids. I don't take care if they take the roof off.

16:31.760 --> 16:34.490
Appreciate it. The going rate for a sitter's $20 an hour, so...

16:34.490 --> 16:36.610
Look, Joe, anything I can do to help.

16:36.610 --> 16:39.270
Sarah told me about the money issues.

16:39.270 --> 16:42.410
Well, if anyone can keep Ojai out of bankruptcy, it's your daughter.

16:43.760 --> 16:45.400
Bankruptcy?

16:45.960 --> 16:48.640
Yeah...I thought when...

16:48.640 --> 16:50.390
What's going on, Joe?

16:51.830 --> 16:54.630
I think that you should wait to hear from Sarah.

16:56.130 --> 16:58.970
Whatever you're afraid of Sarah doing to you, I'm her mother.

16:58.970 --> 17:01.830
It stands to reason I'm the one who taught her how.

17:05.150 --> 17:07.290
How bad is it?

17:09.579 --> 17:12.069
It's pretty bad.

17:20.730 --> 17:22.040
Payday.

17:22.210 --> 17:24.310
Sun is shining and I'm here for my moolah.

17:24.310 --> 17:26.540
See what happens when you show up to work sober?

17:26.540 --> 17:29.970
Listen, ah, I have to go to this crazy family benefit thing tonight.

17:29.970 --> 17:32.590
Sorry, you're on the schedule. You're working, dude.

17:32.590 --> 17:34.580
Ah, Julian's covering for me.

17:35.400 --> 17:36.810
Then, why'd you bring it up?

17:36.810 --> 17:39.060
I was wondering if..ah...

17:39.060 --> 17:41.690
you know, now that I'm, like, a little less of a bonehead, if

17:41.690 --> 17:43.890
maybe you found me more attractive?

17:43.890 --> 17:46.130
Is that your way of asking me to go with you?

17:46.130 --> 17:48.060
Maybe.

17:48.060 --> 17:51.220
Oh, they have great food, and it's kinda weird and cool.

17:51.220 --> 17:53.050
This is sorta last minute, Justin, and I...

17:53.050 --> 17:54.830
You're the boss. I mean, you're the man.

17:54.830 --> 17:57.380
You can take off whenever you want, right?

17:59.250 --> 18:01.130
Is it super formal?

18:01.130 --> 18:04.260
No, it's L.A. Nothing is formal. I mean, you'd look great in a toga.

18:04.760 --> 18:07.160
You'd look really great in a toga.

18:07.160 --> 18:09.410
Look, it's for a great cause, I mean, it's a kids' hospital.

18:09.410 --> 18:12.150
It'll be rockin'...

18:12.500 --> 18:13.690
It's a date.

18:13.690 --> 18:16.740
Great. Ah, so, I'll, ah, I'll pick you up at seven.

18:17.780 --> 18:19.850
Write the cheque. Everyone else has stepped up.

18:19.850 --> 18:21.420
Do you want me to tell the committee you're tapped out

18:21.420 --> 18:23.560
because you bought a picnic boat?

18:23.560 --> 18:27.610
$25,000. Yes. Yes.

18:28.760 --> 18:30.910
Ah, you're the best, Carla. Thank you.

18:32.090 --> 18:34.860
Does anybody ever tell you to bugger off?

18:34.860 --> 18:36.950
- We have to talk.
- You hate the dress?

18:36.950 --> 18:39.030
It's about Ojai.

18:39.030 --> 18:41.360
Something horrible is going on with the company

18:41.360 --> 18:43.670
and Sarah is afraid to discuss it with me.

18:43.670 --> 18:45.770
- How did you know?
- How did you know?

18:46.170 --> 18:50.550
And why am I the very last person in this family to find out everything?

18:50.550 --> 18:53.150
Well, because Mother, you're so chill.

18:53.820 --> 18:55.830
Look, money is tight,

18:55.830 --> 18:59.640
and they're maybe going to sell one of the divisons or something,

18:59.640 --> 19:02.410
but I talked to Sarah and everything is going to be fine.

19:02.410 --> 19:04.770
Joe made it sound a whole lot worse than that.

19:04.770 --> 19:06.210
Joe told you?

19:06.210 --> 19:08.520
He let it slip, but I can't get him into trouble,

19:08.520 --> 19:11.900
so you have got to talk to Sarah and find out what is going on

19:11.900 --> 19:13.320
and get her to come to me.

19:13.320 --> 19:16.220
Remind her how understanding I can be.

19:16.220 --> 19:18.290
What?

19:18.960 --> 19:21.690
Wow! Somebody likes shopping.

19:21.690 --> 19:25.570
All right, before you look at the price tags, I want you to know, I'm not keeping them both,

19:25.570 --> 19:27.370
So?

19:28.220 --> 19:29.240
What do you think?

19:29.240 --> 19:33.090
It's fine. Just like the other six black dresses in your closet.

19:34.600 --> 19:36.640
Are you gonna be like this all night?

19:36.640 --> 19:39.660
It's just one evening and it's really important to your mother.

19:39.660 --> 19:42.080
Unzip me, please.

19:42.900 --> 19:45.850
I thought of a name today: Henry.

19:45.850 --> 19:48.240
Henry William. What do you think?

19:48.240 --> 19:49.540
Could be rough on a girl.

19:49.540 --> 19:51.140
Girls' names are harder.

19:51.140 --> 19:54.100
Even the classics sound so trendy.

19:54.100 --> 19:56.980
Emily, Olivia, Alexandra,

19:56.980 --> 19:58.780
I want something unique.

19:58.780 --> 20:01.370
Maybe something with an "N" for your mother.

20:02.940 --> 20:04.820
Tommy?

20:05.260 --> 20:07.130
What is it?

20:08.550 --> 20:11.160
You look gorgeous, that's all.

20:11.740 --> 20:13.990
I'm gonna hop in the shower.

20:15.000 --> 20:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

20:34.310 --> 20:35.830
Oh, hi.

20:36.520 --> 20:38.670
- Hi, Joe.
- Hello, Gorgeous.

20:39.250 --> 20:42.200
OK, Sarah, real quick, I've been trying to call you all day --

20:42.200 --> 20:44.820
Mom told me that the company is in real trouble.

20:44.820 --> 20:47.700
- She what?
- Yeah, apparently, Joe told her.

20:47.700 --> 20:48.950
Joe told her what?

20:48.950 --> 20:51.280
Well, he didn't mean to. He didn't know that you hadn't spoken to her yet,

20:51.280 --> 20:54.030
and you can't be mad at him...you know... just, let's--

20:54.030 --> 20:55.740
Joe?

20:58.390 --> 21:00.570
Hi, Amber. Wow.

21:00.570 --> 21:02.190
Kitty, isn't this so exciting?

21:02.190 --> 21:05.000
Yeah. No, it is. It is exciting.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.410
What are you doing here? Are you bringing me research or something?

21:08.410 --> 21:11.620
You're so funny, Kitty. No, I was asked, at the last second.

21:11.620 --> 21:13.830
Asked? Asked by whom?

21:13.830 --> 21:15.020
Um...

21:15.020 --> 21:17.290
Oh, hello Kitty. You look wonderful.

21:17.290 --> 21:20.360
Oh, thanks. Thanks, Warren.

21:20.360 --> 21:22.810
Warren, Warren, thank you, thank you.

21:22.810 --> 21:24.290
Thank you so much.

21:24.900 --> 21:27.310
Why are you thanking him and why are you kissing him?

21:27.310 --> 21:29.080
Howie Mandel dropped out yesterday,

21:29.080 --> 21:31.260
I had to ask Warren to be our M.C.

21:31.260 --> 21:33.430
and he stepped in like the white knight that he is.

21:34.050 --> 21:35.750
- Really.
- That's great.

21:35.750 --> 21:38.130
Kevin! Kevin!

21:38.600 --> 21:40.200
Sarah, Joe?

21:41.680 --> 21:45.320
Look at my children. You look so beautiful!

21:45.320 --> 21:47.420
I think it's time.

21:47.420 --> 21:49.910
Shall we make our entrance?

21:57.810 --> 21:58.740
Ladies and Gentlemen,

21:58.740 --> 22:03.470
Welcome to the 20th Annual Pasadena Children's Hospital Fund Benefit.

22:03.470 --> 22:05.260
I am your M.C., Warren Salter,

22:05.260 --> 22:07.560
and even thought I play a pundit on TV,

22:07.560 --> 22:10.910
tonight we're here not for politics, but for the children.

22:10.910 --> 22:14.390
"For the children?" That would explain why he brought one.

22:16.090 --> 22:18.700
Last year, Nora Walker and her tireless...

22:18.700 --> 22:20.740
Look at it all! We did it!

22:20.740 --> 22:22.600
...raised over $200,000 dollars.

22:23.950 --> 22:25.770
I'll talk to you later.

22:26.240 --> 22:29.730
Kevin, Scotty's here. He's working. You should talk to him.

22:29.730 --> 22:32.230
Yes, I will. Thank you, Mom. Excuse me.

22:32.230 --> 22:35.020
Tonight, we plan on doubling...

22:35.020 --> 22:37.070
You have to get your sister to talk to me.

22:37.070 --> 22:38.660
No, I am not doing you any more favors, Mom.

22:38.660 --> 22:41.440
How could you ask that man to host? How could you do such a thing?

22:41.440 --> 22:42.730
I had no choice.

22:42.730 --> 22:47.680
He's the only "D"-level celebrity I know, other than you, with all due respect,

22:47.680 --> 22:51.770
Honey, you can't be mad at people for who they bring to this,

22:51.770 --> 22:53.650
It's such a great cause.

22:54.230 --> 22:55.970
Nora,

22:55.970 --> 22:59.150
Hi. Ah, you look so pretty.

22:59.730 --> 23:01.530
Hello, Nora, Kitty

23:01.530 --> 23:04.220
You both look so stunning this evening.

23:04.880 --> 23:08.050
Let's go back to Broadway.

23:09.940 --> 23:13.840
Oh? Time to sit already? Well, I don't wanna be rude.

23:13.840 --> 23:16.510
All right, well, I'm sure we'll see you later.

23:20.500 --> 23:25.010
Well, Mother, you can't be mad at people for who they bring to this. It's--

23:25.010 --> 23:27.530
It's such a great cause.

23:36.490 --> 23:38.130
No...

23:38.760 --> 23:40.750
Please tell me you didn't, Justin...

23:40.750 --> 23:42.770
Justin, it's a black and white ball.

23:42.770 --> 23:44.700
Are you color blind or just a total moron?

23:44.700 --> 23:46.520
I can't stay here. Take me home, now, please.

23:46.520 --> 23:48.310
Wait, wait a second.

23:48.310 --> 23:50.950
We're sitting at the wicked table.

23:50.950 --> 23:52.360
I'm in green.

23:52.360 --> 23:54.130
They'll think I'm the Wicked Witch of the West.

23:54.130 --> 23:57.250
Wait...just don't worry, OK?

23:57.820 --> 24:00.320
Here, put this on.

24:03.990 --> 24:05.850
Nice moves. You see that in some movie?

24:05.850 --> 24:08.530
Yeah, the one where the guy gets the girl.

24:15.810 --> 24:18.100
They look hungry at Camelot.

24:22.230 --> 24:23.750
Could we please talk for a second?

24:23.750 --> 24:25.030
I'm actually working right now.

24:25.030 --> 24:27.710
And you don't wanna get caught talking to the help.

24:27.710 --> 24:29.500
OK, you're still mad, I get it.

24:29.500 --> 24:32.890
Well, at the moment, I have to make sure that everyone at Pippen gets their drinks.

24:32.890 --> 24:35.800
We'll talk a little bit later, OK?

24:35.970 --> 24:37.380
Well, can I have one?

24:37.380 --> 24:39.390
I'm not your waiter. Get it yourself.

24:44.360 --> 24:46.000
I can't believe you told Mom.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.520
All I know is that you told me you were gonna tell her.

24:48.520 --> 24:53.230
Well, one might be more careful when one casually drops a word like 'bankruptcy.'

24:53.230 --> 24:55.270
Sarah, you know, you have got to talk to Mom.

24:55.270 --> 24:57.360
Kitty, it's not that simple.

24:58.290 --> 25:01.710
Oh, goody! There are you, Kitty. Warren said we're dining with you.

25:01.710 --> 25:04.140
Oh? Oh, that's great. That's great.

25:04.140 --> 25:06.360
You know, you can-- yeah, there's a seat right over there for you.

25:07.370 --> 25:09.470
- Did she just say "goody"?
- Yeah.

25:12.700 --> 25:14.910
- Hey, everybody.
- Hi.

25:15.040 --> 25:17.960
Oh, Julia, you look beautiful.

25:18.460 --> 25:21.010
Hey, everyone, this is Tyler. She's my boss.

25:21.010 --> 25:23.380
But, tonight, I'm just his inappropriately-dressed date.

25:23.380 --> 25:27.700
No, don't tell me. Someone forgot to tell you it was a black and white event?

25:29.590 --> 25:32.040
Oh, Kevin, did you see? Scotty's here.

25:32.040 --> 25:33.900
Yeah, I know. I know. Thank you.

25:33.900 --> 25:35.710
Oh, no, I'd better not.

25:35.710 --> 25:37.770
Are you sure? You may need it for the live auction.

25:38.270 --> 25:41.150
Is there something you guys wanna tell us?

25:41.150 --> 25:43.850
- No, not yet.
- Honey...

25:43.850 --> 25:45.990
Have you guys finally decided to start trying?

25:45.990 --> 25:48.610
I'm hoping to be pregnant by Christmas.

25:50.450 --> 25:52.390
You know, Paige was asking for a cousin just last week.

25:52.390 --> 25:53.400
Really?

25:53.400 --> 25:55.400
This is wonderful news! Wonderful!

25:55.400 --> 25:56.990
I think it calls for a toast.

25:56.990 --> 25:59.850
Everyone, please raise your glasses.

25:59.850 --> 26:01.960
To Tommy and Julia,

26:01.960 --> 26:04.770
who are finally going to start to fulfill their end of the bargain

26:04.770 --> 26:07.680
and give me lots of beautiful grandchildren.

26:07.680 --> 26:09.390
- To Tommy and Julia. Cheers!
- Yeah, cheers.

26:09.390 --> 26:12.120
I gotta...I gotta go to the bathroom.

26:12.120 --> 26:13.710
OK.

26:13.710 --> 26:16.980
You must be Mrs. Walker. I've heard so many great things about you.

26:16.980 --> 26:19.470
- From Kitty?
- No, Warren.

26:19.940 --> 26:22.040
Ah, Amber, you wanna dance?

26:22.040 --> 26:24.300
Sure. I love old music.

26:26.740 --> 26:27.990
Where did Amber just go?

26:27.990 --> 26:30.530
Oh, you know, they just opened up the kids' buffet.

26:31.280 --> 26:33.120
That's funny. Come on,

26:33.120 --> 26:36.110
if you're going to insult me, at least do it on the dance floor.

26:37.650 --> 26:40.070
Well, I can do that.

26:41.720 --> 26:44.400
Look, I know we barely know each other, but

26:44.400 --> 26:46.290
could you--could you please be honest with me?

26:46.290 --> 26:48.390
Sure. I'm a bad liar, anyway.

26:48.390 --> 26:50.420
If you were kinda dating this guy

26:50.420 --> 26:55.410
and he said he would pay for you not to come as a catering waiter to this event tonight, but as his date,

26:55.410 --> 26:58.640
is...is that ... so bad?

26:58.640 --> 27:00.300
Yes.

27:00.800 --> 27:03.210
OK, let me rephrase that. If a guy you were kinda dating....

27:03.210 --> 27:05.310
You can't buy someone's time.

27:05.310 --> 27:08.780
It's all tied to pride and the work ethic, like Sigmund Freud said.

27:09.810 --> 27:11.380
What did Freud say?

27:11.380 --> 27:14.230
He said, "Love and work are the cornerstones of our human-ness."

27:15.360 --> 27:18.680
Wow. Do people underestimate you a lot?

27:18.680 --> 27:20.730
It goes with the hair.

27:21.570 --> 27:23.990
Yeah, I mean, I just met her Mom, she's...

27:24.730 --> 27:26.980
So, are you having fun? You seem a little -- are you all right?

27:26.980 --> 27:28.640
- Yeah.
- May I cut in?

27:28.640 --> 27:31.030
No, I'm so sorry, Harry, I'm trying to catch up with my son.

27:31.030 --> 27:33.730
We're all caught up. Go for it, Mr. D. Enjoy.

27:37.830 --> 27:41.210
Harry, I'm telling you, if you make a fool out of me,

27:41.210 --> 27:44.080
I'll cut your nuts off.

27:45.250 --> 27:46.670
I think we should try something.

27:46.670 --> 27:48.670
Oh? What would that be? A menage?

27:48.670 --> 27:51.190
No, it's called a truce.

27:52.310 --> 27:55.030
When did she happen? How did she happen?

27:55.030 --> 27:56.390
I know she's younger...

27:56.390 --> 27:59.330
No "~er." Drop the "~er."

28:00.320 --> 28:02.760
Ugh, I can't believe I broke up with him.

28:02.760 --> 28:07.170
I ended an engagement only to find out that you're dating Malibu Barbie.

28:07.170 --> 28:10.230
You broke up with Jonathan because of what was wrong with you two

28:10.230 --> 28:12.310
not because of what was right with us.

28:12.310 --> 28:14.780
Don't spin it now that you're available, and I'm not.

28:15.230 --> 28:17.480
Oh, OK. You're right.

28:18.910 --> 28:19.960
I am?

28:19.960 --> 28:22.920
- Yes, and I'm sorry.
- You are?

28:23.420 --> 28:28.160
Is is that hard to believe that I have the capacity to acknowledge that I might be wrong about something?

28:28.620 --> 28:30.240
Do you want me to answer that?

28:30.240 --> 28:33.760
No. I just want you to keep on dancing.

28:41.050 --> 28:42.440
Been looking for you.

28:42.440 --> 28:45.830
Hey, sorry, I just, I was getting claustraphobic.

28:46.890 --> 28:48.560
I didn't mean to embarass you.

28:48.560 --> 28:51.340
I just...having a baby is all I think about,

28:51.340 --> 28:55.510
I thought you'd feel more comfortable if you saw your family's reaction.

28:58.030 --> 29:00.530
You're just not ready, are you?

29:02.760 --> 29:05.340
Is that what you think, Jules?

29:06.720 --> 29:10.460
I want this baby so....bad.

29:11.120 --> 29:13.090
Tommy?

29:13.090 --> 29:16.340
Can--Can we--Can we go somewhere more private?

29:16.750 --> 29:18.910
Yeah.

29:20.360 --> 29:25.430
You have no idea how badly I wish I could fix this, do... something...

29:25.430 --> 29:27.360
How long have you known?

29:27.360 --> 29:29.760
Since yesterday.

29:30.600 --> 29:34.620
I am so sorry I let you down. I'm sorry.

29:35.840 --> 29:38.070
It's not your fault.

29:38.970 --> 29:40.550
Tommy

29:40.550 --> 29:43.500
Having children with you would make me the happiest woman in the world,

29:43.500 --> 29:47.440
but, I don't care how we have them.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.750
- God, I love you.
- I love you.

29:56.710 --> 29:58.620
- Tommy?
- Yeah?

29:59.740 --> 30:01.750
What are we doing?

30:03.490 --> 30:05.890
So, it was a bad idea, offering to pay?

30:05.890 --> 30:08.580
Not if the person you offered to pay is a hooker.

30:08.800 --> 30:10.570
Yeah, you're right.

30:12.950 --> 30:16.820
Oh well, "La Bamba" is my cue to leave any dance floor immediately.

30:16.820 --> 30:19.710
Sorry. Go, Twinkletoes.

30:19.710 --> 30:21.600
I think your brother is getting very drunk.

30:21.600 --> 30:24.150
I know, and it's so cool it's not me, right?

30:26.700 --> 30:28.100
Whoa! Not too bad!

30:28.100 --> 30:30.900
Harry, I really got to go, I got -- I got --

30:30.900 --> 30:33.630
I don't think your sister is happy.

30:33.630 --> 30:35.010
Well, give her time.

30:35.010 --> 30:37.490
I don't mean it that way.

30:37.490 --> 30:41.420
She looks afraid...for her life.

30:41.420 --> 30:44.290
She's dancing with Harry Packer.

30:44.290 --> 30:45.810
She should be.

30:46.140 --> 30:50.560
Oh, Harry. Harry, you are on thin ice and you're jumping up and down.

30:50.560 --> 30:53.280
Ooh, I like it when you're stern with me, Nora.

30:53.280 --> 30:55.160
Ooh! Harry!

30:55.160 --> 30:56.800
Harry!

30:57.250 --> 30:58.530
Margaret...

30:58.530 --> 31:00.680
Margaret, I'm so sorry you had to witness that.

31:00.680 --> 31:02.380
So am I.

31:02.380 --> 31:04.880
One of my very best friends making a pass at my husband!

31:04.880 --> 31:05.940
Margaret, I can explain this--

31:05.940 --> 31:08.290
Shut up, Harry. We're going home.

31:11.020 --> 31:12.840
Margaret--

31:14.980 --> 31:17.370
I defended you. llana Sparrow told me.

31:17.370 --> 31:18.990
She said that without a doubt

31:18.990 --> 31:20.780
you'd go after someone else's husband before Christmas.

31:20.780 --> 31:23.030
- What?
- I just didn't think it'd be mine.

31:25.430 --> 31:26.800
- Mom?
- Oh, God, Nora.

31:26.800 --> 31:28.580
Tommy!

31:29.620 --> 31:32.700
Like mother, like son. No sense of decency.

31:32.700 --> 31:35.300
Is that my mink?

31:41.810 --> 31:44.840
On a professional level, I'm asking you, please leave me alone right now.

31:44.841 --> 31:48.640
Look, all I wanted to do was take you a nice dress-up party with my family

31:48.750 --> 31:50.520
and now it's just turned into a quagmire.

31:50.520 --> 31:52.700
We'll talk about this later when you're sober and I'm not at work.

31:52.700 --> 31:54.120
I never get like this, OK?

31:54.120 --> 31:55.980
I never lose control over anyone.

31:55.980 --> 31:57.230
Am I supposed to be flattered?

31:57.230 --> 32:00.540
Yes, so could you please forgive me so I can stop getting drunk?

32:02.500 --> 32:06.200
I promise, I'll never offer to pay for anything ever again, not a dinner

32:06.200 --> 32:09.400
or a movie, or not even a parking meter.

32:09.400 --> 32:12.860
OK. Enough. I forgive you.

32:12.860 --> 32:14.700
Really?

32:17.090 --> 32:18.850
Scotty Wendell

32:19.260 --> 32:21.690
That's it, you're fired.

32:24.640 --> 32:27.930
It's OK. Wait here. Even wasted, I can handle this one.

32:31.160 --> 32:33.190
Stations 4 and 5 need bussing.

32:34.670 --> 32:37.220
Look, I am sorry to fire your little boyfriend back--

32:37.220 --> 32:41.460
Scott's not just my little boyfriend, he's also my little client. I'm an attorney.

32:41.460 --> 32:44.180
Look, don't make this into a gay thing. I'd have done the same thing if you were a chick.

32:44.180 --> 32:46.980
Would all your employees, past and present, confirm that?

32:46.980 --> 32:51.760
I'll tell you why, because first thing tomorrow morning, we'll be asking all of them. I'll do that after scheduling the depositions

32:51.760 --> 32:56.330
and I'll leave yours till last 'cause you'll be way too busy answering the mountain of interrogatories we'll be serving you.

32:57.620 --> 33:03.260
Maybe I should've given Scott a warning first. My fault.

33:03.260 --> 33:06.240
Maybe, but speaking as a guest, Scott's a really hard worker,

33:06.240 --> 33:08.890
so if I were you, I'd give him a raise.

33:10.410 --> 33:13.390
I can't tell you how beautiful you look tonight, Holly. Really.

33:13.770 --> 33:16.840
Look at this. Everybody is staring at you.

33:17.970 --> 33:19.610
I hope that's not because...

33:19.610 --> 33:21.280
Oh, no, no, no, please. Don't be silly.

33:21.280 --> 33:23.230
You're gorgeous.

33:23.230 --> 33:25.380
- I'll be right back. 
- OK.

33:25.380 --> 33:27.300
- I'm gonna go powder my nose.
- Who's this?

33:27.300 --> 33:29.240
- Is that your daughter?
- Yeah.

33:29.740 --> 33:31.630
- What's her name again?
- Her name's Becky.

33:31.630 --> 33:34.120
Becky. That's right, Becky.

33:34.120 --> 33:35.610
She's in college, right?

33:35.610 --> 33:37.760
She was.

33:37.760 --> 33:40.830
She's now doing an Independent Study

33:40.830 --> 33:42.730
if you know what I mean.

33:42.730 --> 33:44.790
Beautiful.

33:45.030 --> 33:47.070
- I'll be right back.
- OK.

33:51.940 --> 33:53.360
Rebecca

33:54.990 --> 33:56.100
Rebecca

33:56.100 --> 33:58.890
Darn it. Have you got a bobby pin? I thought I put one in here.

33:58.890 --> 34:00.490
Sorry.

34:01.840 --> 34:05.580
Take more than a bobby pin to fix this evening.

34:07.390 --> 34:09.150
Have you got children?

34:09.150 --> 34:11.139
Four of them. All grown now.

34:11.420 --> 34:14.340
So are mine, but not tonight, they're not. No, no, no

34:14.340 --> 34:18.050
tonight they're not grown. They're monsters. That's what they are,

34:18.050 --> 34:22.750
and you wanna know why? Because their father was a fornicating cheat who kept a harlot for years.

34:22.750 --> 34:25.750
And now they're furious. You wanna know what else?

34:25.750 --> 34:27.920
The fornicatress is amongst us tonight,

34:27.920 --> 34:30.670
brought by my brother. How do you like that?

34:30.670 --> 34:34.020
My brother married my sister-in-law after she had married my uncle

34:34.020 --> 34:38.610
and they all ended up in jail in Galisteo, New Mexico for selling the mushrooms.

34:52.679 --> 34:54.940
Holly

34:57.050 --> 34:59.250
Nora, here.

34:59.690 --> 35:02.400
If you're really in a pinch, you won't mind sharing.

35:02.400 --> 35:05.490
Oh, I think I've shared quite enough with you already.

35:06.440 --> 35:10.240
I don't know what the etiquette is in our situation,

35:10.540 --> 35:14.050
but at what point am I allowed to be rude back?

35:14.050 --> 35:17.720
You'll forgive me if I don't know what to do about you!

35:17.720 --> 35:21.340
Well, stop seeing me as the woman who slept with your husband.

35:21.340 --> 35:25.030
And what? Start seeing as you as the woman who is manipulating the affections of my brother?

35:25.770 --> 35:29.330
Don't you want your brother to be happy?

35:33.620 --> 35:36.360
The sad thing is, Nora,

35:36.360 --> 35:39.550
Neither one of us really got what we wanted.

35:46.990 --> 35:49.410
And next up, the big ticket item...

35:49.410 --> 35:51.560
A family vacation for 8 to New Zealand,

35:51.560 --> 35:53.580
So go ahead and outbid your friends without guilt.

35:53.580 --> 35:55.780
Speaking of guilt, how was the public sex?

35:55.780 --> 35:57.004
Oh, shut up.

35:57.004 --> 35:57.079
Justin, please. It's not funny.

36:00.290 --> 36:01.940
We're literally laughing-stocks.

36:01.940 --> 36:05.100
Oh, come on, don't be ashamed. A good sex scandal never hurt anyone.

36:05.100 --> 36:09.730
Well, it's very "Kennedy," isn't it? To be part of some luridly, glamorous sex scandal?

36:09.730 --> 36:13.160
There is nothing amusing about anything that's gone on here tonight.

36:13.160 --> 36:16.630
Nora, I am so sorry. I am beyond mortified.

36:16.630 --> 36:18.960
Julia, could you please stop apologizing?

36:18.960 --> 36:23.400
Could we all just stop pretending that we're perfect people?

36:23.400 --> 36:26.290
- Just for 14 seconds?
- That would be great.

36:26.290 --> 36:30.430
Just remember, it's unbelievable countryside, fine dining,

36:30.430 --> 36:33.890
Sarah, you have no reason to be angry at your husband,

36:33.890 --> 36:35.450
I forced it out of him

36:35.450 --> 36:38.370
and I'm sure your sister, Kitty, has told you, I know everything.

36:38.370 --> 36:40.030
You don't know anything.

36:40.540 --> 36:44.270
If the company is in trouble, if the two of you have done something that you should tell me...

36:44.270 --> 36:45.430
We've done something?

36:45.430 --> 36:47.030
I shouldn't be kept in the dark.

36:47.030 --> 36:49.740
It wasn't just your father that built Ojai, it was me, too,

36:49.740 --> 36:51.790
raising you kids all by myself,

36:51.790 --> 36:54.240
that afforded him the luxury to build a company in the first place.

36:54.240 --> 36:59.910
"Company"? If we have a roof over our head in three months, we'll be doing very well.

37:00.520 --> 37:04.320
No, no, no. If it were that bad, your father would have told me.

37:04.320 --> 37:06.820
- Because he shared so much?
- Sarah...

37:08.670 --> 37:11.190
The company's dying, Mom,

37:11.670 --> 37:13.370
now if you wanna blame me, blame me,

37:13.370 --> 37:16.420
or perhaps, in your all-knowing wisdom and mother-ness

37:16.420 --> 37:21.400
you could save it somehow so that we could keep coming to this wretched event year after year!

37:21.500 --> 37:23.750
26? Going once...

37:24.240 --> 37:25.650
Going twice.

37:25.650 --> 37:26.800
Sarah!

37:26.800 --> 37:31.160
Sold! To the lovely and generous Mrs. Nora Walker for $25,800.這?可愛大方的女士拍得
Nora Walker出價二萬五百八千?元!

37:33.300 --> 37:34.450
- No!
- Yeah!

37:34.450 --> 37:35.590
Mom, Mom, you bid.

37:35.590 --> 37:37.500
No, no, you did. You bid.

37:37.500 --> 37:39.200
- I didn't!
- You bid!

37:39.200 --> 37:40.290
I didn't.

37:40.290 --> 37:42.700
Well, listen, I-I always wanted to see New Zealand.

37:42.700 --> 37:45.190
No one knows us there. Maybe we could move there.

37:50.190 --> 37:51.980
No?

38:05.380 --> 38:07.120
Sarah.

38:07.120 --> 38:10.140
Joe, could I have a few moments with my daughter, please?

38:16.820 --> 38:19.110
You walked into it, didn't you?

38:19.990 --> 38:23.200
When you joined the company, and you didn't know what you'd walked into, right?

38:29.720 --> 38:34.560
Dad sold a million dollars worth of stock back to the company

38:34.560 --> 38:36.590
but he inflated the value.

38:36.590 --> 38:39.640
Ojai paid $15 million for it.

38:40.520 --> 38:43.350
$15 million we can't find.

38:44.090 --> 38:46.590
$15 million?

38:46.590 --> 38:50.020
He used the pension fund to cover the short-fall.

38:50.230 --> 38:53.230
Saul tried and tried to hold it together

38:53.230 --> 38:55.170
and so did I.

38:55.170 --> 38:57.240
and so did Tommy.

38:57.670 --> 38:59.950
But, we're sinking fast.

38:59.950 --> 39:01.670
Oh God!

39:01.880 --> 39:06.290
Oh, Mom. I never knew anything could be this hard.

39:06.290 --> 39:10.040
We -- we can't catch a break. There's never any good news.

39:10.040 --> 39:12.990
I work and work and I miss my children, and

39:12.990 --> 39:15.960
I don't recognize myself anymore.

39:15.960 --> 39:19.050
Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry I wasn't there.

39:20.470 --> 39:23.850
You never asked me for anything. You act so self-sufficient all the time.

39:23.850 --> 39:26.210
I got that from you, Mom.

39:26.580 --> 39:28.920
I watched you power through life.

39:28.920 --> 39:32.360
You had Kitty to fight with, Kevin to admire,

39:32.360 --> 39:35.360
Justin to baby, Tommy to lean on,

39:36.340 --> 39:39.340
What were you thinking about me all that time?

39:41.330 --> 39:43.190
What was I thinking?

39:45.070 --> 39:47.680
I was thinking...

39:48.680 --> 39:51.030
I was...

39:51.850 --> 39:55.750
I ... am in awe of you, Sarah.

39:57.210 --> 40:00.190
You became the woman I always wanted to be.

40:00.190 --> 40:04.180
And you did it all without losing your softness or your goodness.

40:04.940 --> 40:07.260
I love all my children,

40:10.070 --> 40:12.880
but I have so much respect for you, Sarah.

40:17.360 --> 40:21.360
All of that and you gave me two of the most perfect grandchildren on Earth.

40:22.460 --> 40:26.130
You're not a daughter, Sarah. You're the damn trifecta.

40:31.090 --> 40:33.320
You rock, Ma.

40:35.180 --> 40:37.510
You just do.

40:38.840 --> 40:41.560
You should go and find your sister.

40:41.560 --> 40:44.130
She needs you now. Your family needs you.

40:44.130 --> 40:46.430
What are you talking about? I can't leave you alone like that.

40:46.430 --> 40:47.680
I'll grab a taxi.

40:47.680 --> 40:50.890
Imagine we were in New York. You'd think nothing of it.

40:50.890 --> 40:52.650
Go on.

40:52.650 --> 40:56.010
I'll be upset if you don't.

40:56.510 --> 40:58.530
It's been a wonderful night.

41:02.280 --> 41:04.090
It has.

41:09.330 --> 41:14.150
*I'm a sparrow on the roof*

41:17.580 --> 41:21.070
*I'm the list of everyone*

41:21.070 --> 41:23.350
*I have to lose*

41:23.350 --> 41:25.520
Compliments of the management.

41:25.520 --> 41:26.980
Fabulous.

41:27.880 --> 41:29.040
Hey, all, what's the skinny?

41:29.040 --> 41:30.610
Scotty, how nice.

41:30.610 --> 41:31.980
Would you care to dance?

41:31.980 --> 41:33.610
No, honey, I don't wanna go inside.

41:33.610 --> 41:36.020
Who said anything about going back inside?

41:37.080 --> 41:40.770
*And how much I can hurt*

41:42.000 --> 41:50.100
*So I will look for you, in stories of the new kings*

41:50.100 --> 41:52.300
*westward leading*

41:52.300 --> 41:54.680
*still proceeding*

41:54.680 --> 41:58.710
*to the world unseen*
