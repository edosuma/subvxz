WEBVTT

00:04.736 --> 00:07.602
I can't, I gotta go drive my car now,

00:07.603 --> 00:10.241
I got-- Huh?
I dunno, ask her.

00:10.308 --> 00:13.674
I gotta drive my automobile, on road!

00:13.675 --> 00:16.541
[laughs]
[slurping]

00:16.542 --> 00:19.207
What? Are you
shitting me?

00:19.208 --> 00:21.574
Pfff, see about this bullshit.

00:21.575 --> 00:23.307
[groans]
[car horn honking]

00:23.308 --> 00:27.207
Hey! Yeah, that's
the ol' pepper!

00:27.208 --> 00:30.641
[chuckling] Take me to
my house that I live in!

00:30.642 --> 00:33.508
[giggles]

00:33.509 --> 00:35.208
[slurping]

00:36.475 --> 00:38.407
[belches]

00:38.408 --> 00:41.374
Oh, oh my God, rumaki.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.508
Do you smell that?

00:42.509 --> 00:45.307
Uh, I did not, actually.
[scoffs]

00:45.308 --> 00:47.508
Matter of fact,
I can't smell anything.

00:47.509 --> 00:48.708
Archer.
Wha--?

00:48.709 --> 00:51.274
Barry?
[laughs] Hey, dummy.

00:51.275 --> 00:52.395
No, no, no.
Wa-wa-wa-wa-wait.

00:54.375 --> 00:56.274
Bulletproof.

00:56.275 --> 00:58.307
[high-pitched whining]

00:58.308 --> 01:00.374
[voice muffled]
You say "bulletproof?"

01:00.375 --> 01:02.307
[Barry, muffled]
You can't tell, can you?

01:02.308 --> 01:04.474
You think I'm gonna be that dumb?
Oh, my God.

01:04.474 --> 01:06.274
Mawp.
...not really surprising.

01:06.275 --> 01:07.641
Bet you're surprised
to see me though, huh?

01:07.642 --> 01:10.441
Yes, I am, Barry,
because I blew your ass up

01:10.442 --> 01:12.508
in a grain elevator!
Oww! [brakes screeching]

01:12.509 --> 01:13.641
Yeah, Archer, I remember.

01:13.642 --> 01:16.274
Every time I look
in the goddamn mirror!

01:16.275 --> 01:18.341
The-- Wait, are you
invisible now?

01:18.342 --> 01:20.241
No, you idiot!

01:20.242 --> 01:22.441
I'm just a walking
titanium endoskeleton.

01:22.442 --> 01:25.274
Oh. So, do you clank, or-- Oww!
[brakes screeching]

01:25.275 --> 01:27.474
Yes, dickhole,
I clank! Happy?

01:27.475 --> 01:30.407
I mean-- Well, I'm not!
And ya wanna know why?

01:30.408 --> 01:32.307
Because, not even in this order,

01:32.308 --> 01:34.341
you shot me,
shattered both my femurs,

01:34.342 --> 01:37.608
cornholed both my fiancées,
got me turned into a robot,

01:37.609 --> 01:40.541
left me to die
in outer frickin' space!

01:40.542 --> 01:43.541
And also blew me up in a grain elevator!
[slurping]

01:43.542 --> 01:48.407
[coughing] Oh my God, Framboise!
Remember her?

01:48.408 --> 01:50.307
Yes, Archer, I do.
And that alone

01:50.308 --> 01:51.674
would be reason enough to kill you!

01:51.675 --> 01:53.574
But that is not why
I came to L.A.

01:53.575 --> 01:57.274
Well, if it was to see the Aztecs
play, I got some bad news.

01:57.275 --> 02:00.307
Will you shut up? I came
out here to find someone.

02:00.308 --> 02:02.641
[chuckles] And then I
saw this little guy.

02:02.642 --> 02:05.508
[Barry laughing] Oh,
for-- Goddamn it, Pam!

02:05.509 --> 02:07.474
I can't believe you're a private eye.

02:07.475 --> 02:09.374
Well, it's better than driving a cab!

02:09.375 --> 02:11.474
I don't drive a cab, super sleuth!

02:11.475 --> 02:14.641
This is just a ruse.
I clamped your car.

02:14.642 --> 02:17.608
Why? Because, you
giant flapping anus,

02:17.609 --> 02:19.641
I wanna hire you! I--

02:19.642 --> 02:22.207
Look, not many people
know this, all right,

02:22.208 --> 02:24.574
but I grew up in an orphanage.
I never met my mother,

02:24.575 --> 02:27.674
and I always felt like
I was missing a big piece of,

02:27.675 --> 02:31.407
not me, necessarily, but the me
I could've been, ya know?

02:31.408 --> 02:34.274
And maybe I brought
some of this on myself,

02:34.275 --> 02:37.541
but I feel that there's
a better other Barry in here.

02:37.542 --> 02:40.474
If I could just reconnect
with my birth mother, maybe,

02:40.475 --> 02:42.509
just maybe, we could find him.

02:44.342 --> 02:47.674
[laughing]

02:47.675 --> 02:52.474
Okay. Okay.
Okay. Okay!

02:52.475 --> 02:56.407
Barry, oh man, I mean
how could it occur to you

02:56.408 --> 03:00.341
for a nanosecond
that I would help you?

03:00.342 --> 03:02.407
Hey, I'm coming to you as a man here.

03:02.408 --> 03:06.608
No, you're not. You're coming
to me as a robot mummy!

03:06.609 --> 03:09.374
Oh my God, who's--
Archer, no!

03:09.375 --> 03:10.508
Who's got--

03:10.509 --> 03:12.674
Don't you say it!
No mummy!

03:12.675 --> 03:15.474
[laughing] Okay, so
now we're doing this.

03:15.475 --> 03:17.241
[laughter continues]

[Archer] Ugh, what is
this, a stairs factory?

04:12.275 --> 04:14.641
Ugh! Oh.
Oh, hey.

04:14.642 --> 04:18.274
So, this is Crab Rangoon,
it is going in the refrigerator,

04:18.274 --> 04:20.608
and it is very much mine.
Any questions?

04:20.608 --> 04:24.441
Krieger, looking at you.
Okay, then.

04:24.442 --> 04:27.207
Oh, and so guess
who I saw last night?

04:27.208 --> 04:29.608
Uh, Barry?
Yeah, wait, how'd you--

04:29.609 --> 04:31.341
[Barry] Ahem.
Wha--?

04:31.342 --> 04:32.608
[chuckling]
Hey, dummy.

[All]
No, no, no! Don't!

04:36.275 --> 04:38.674
We already tried that!

04:38.675 --> 04:41.307
Yeah, so, uh, you wanna
throw it at me now?

04:41.308 --> 04:43.207
You know, like the old-timey
Superman mov--

04:43.208 --> 04:44.741
That was obviously sarcasm.

04:44.742 --> 04:48.274
And yet almost as satisfying
as not helping you

04:48.275 --> 04:50.741
find your stupid mother, which
there's no way I'm gonna do!

04:50.742 --> 04:53.274
Well, you say that...
Archer.

04:53.275 --> 04:54.407
Carol?
Her name's Cher--

04:54.408 --> 04:55.741
Pam, shut up!

04:55.742 --> 04:57.608
[Malory]
Help!

04:57.609 --> 04:59.307
Mother?
She can't hear you.

04:59.308 --> 05:00.741
Help!

05:00.742 --> 05:02.407
Mother!
Still can't hear you.

05:02.408 --> 05:04.274
Where is that?
Where is she?

05:04.275 --> 05:07.608
Carol? She's about
ten feet below that.

05:07.609 --> 05:09.274
What?
What is that?

05:09.275 --> 05:10.674
It's a generator running an air pump!

05:10.675 --> 05:13.541
Which is pumping air
to... Carol?

05:13.542 --> 05:15.341
[Archer]
You son of a--

05:15.342 --> 05:17.641
Wait, how did you do all this
since just last night?

05:17.642 --> 05:20.508
Huh? Oh no, no, no. I've been
planning this for weeks.

05:20.509 --> 05:22.341
I knew when I asked you for help

05:22.342 --> 05:23.574
you'd be a big, weeping dick.

05:23.575 --> 05:26.274
Barry, listen to me.
Okay, but remember,

05:26.275 --> 05:27.574
we don't have a lot of time here.

05:27.575 --> 05:30.274
That generator's only got
about 12 more hours'

05:30.275 --> 05:32.374
worth of fuel,
and once it runs out...

05:32.375 --> 05:34.474
[chuckles]
Whoops.

05:34.475 --> 05:35.641
No!
Yeah.

05:35.642 --> 05:37.307
You animal!

05:37.308 --> 05:38.574
Pfff, a robot's like

05:38.575 --> 05:40.407
the furthest thing
you can be from an anim--

05:40.408 --> 05:41.641
Oww!
Seriously.

05:41.642 --> 05:44.474
So if you wanna find
your mother-- [roars]

05:44.475 --> 05:46.441
[group gasps]
Archer.

05:46.442 --> 05:48.641
So, if we're done with the heroics...

05:48.642 --> 05:50.674
For now at least, yeah, I think so.

05:50.675 --> 05:52.641
Good, because just to reiterate...

05:52.642 --> 05:54.508
Time's a bit of a factor here.

05:54.509 --> 05:56.208
[chuckling]

06:02.442 --> 06:04.541
Hello? Who are you?

06:04.542 --> 06:09.474
Why won't you answer me?
What do you want?

06:09.475 --> 06:11.541
[sobs]

06:11.542 --> 06:14.474
Ow! Quit squeezing
the puppy, Lennie!

06:14.475 --> 06:16.641
Oh hush, you big baby. It's
just a through-and-through.

06:16.642 --> 06:18.641
Yes, which means both holes hurt!

06:18.642 --> 06:21.474
Hey, I know you're upset, but we
are gonna find Barry's mother,

06:21.475 --> 06:23.274
and Malory is gonna be okay.

06:23.275 --> 06:25.608
Now, I believe there
was some mention of holes?

06:25.609 --> 06:27.708
[sighs]
Phrasing, boom.

06:27.709 --> 06:30.274
That's the spirit.
Shut up.

06:30.275 --> 06:33.441
And then talk again, but only to help
me think of a way to kill Barry.

06:33.442 --> 06:35.207
Why don't we just find his mother?

06:35.208 --> 06:36.508
Why, just so she can bury him?

06:36.509 --> 06:38.407
Yeah, because trying to kill Barry

06:38.408 --> 06:40.608
has gone so well for you in the past.

06:40.609 --> 06:43.608
Yeah, Lana, but this time it's, um...

06:43.609 --> 06:46.574
[chuckles] Were you gonna say,
"This time it's personal"?

06:46.575 --> 06:49.341
[chuckling]
Yeah, but I didn't.

06:49.342 --> 06:51.341
[clears throat]
But also it is.

06:51.342 --> 06:52.674
[Cyril] Because here's my concern...

06:52.675 --> 06:54.708
The orphanage where
you grew up burned down.

06:54.709 --> 06:58.341
[giggles] Shut up, and all the
records were lost in the fire,

06:58.342 --> 06:59.474
so not only do you not know

06:59.475 --> 07:00.741
your birth mother's name...
No.

07:00.742 --> 07:02.674
You don't know the hospital
where you were born.

07:02.675 --> 07:05.441
Uh-uh. Or the town,
or even the county.

07:05.442 --> 07:07.441
Nope. Or even your
actual date of birth!

07:07.442 --> 07:09.341
I-- Look, if this was easy

07:09.342 --> 07:11.508
I wouldn't have to bury
ladies out in the desert!

07:11.509 --> 07:13.474
Yeah, so did she struggle?

07:13.475 --> 07:15.341
Did you have to punch her
in her bony face?

07:15.342 --> 07:17.641
No, Creepy Spice, I used chloroform.

07:17.642 --> 07:20.341
Aw. Yeah, her husband
didn't even wake up.

07:20.342 --> 07:22.407
Damn machine.
You need a Ph.D.

07:22.408 --> 07:24.407
for this thing.
It's like the Univac.

07:24.408 --> 07:27.574
It says here "grind." It's
already ground from the store!

07:27.575 --> 07:30.608
I just want it to drip, but
there's no button for drip!

07:30.609 --> 07:34.341
What are you,
in the shower? Hello?

07:34.342 --> 07:36.474
Do I need to mess with "program"?

07:36.475 --> 07:39.474
And because it was a closed adoption
with any record of it sealed,

07:39.475 --> 07:43.241
we need to basically hack into the
state's vital records database,

07:43.242 --> 07:44.641
and comb through millions of records!

07:44.642 --> 07:46.374
Yeah, so then do that.

07:46.375 --> 07:47.741
I-- [sighs] But even
if we could hack in--

07:47.742 --> 07:49.774
Their password security's
probably just eight-bit,

07:49.775 --> 07:52.508
so I'd suggest a combination
of dictionary attack,

07:52.509 --> 07:54.508
reverse cryptographic hash function,

07:54.509 --> 07:56.508
and good old-fashioned
brute force.

07:56.509 --> 07:59.341
Oh, we can do that?
Lemon squeezy.

07:59.342 --> 08:01.541
Oh, okay, but my larger,
sort of overall concern

08:01.542 --> 08:03.274
is that it's a felony.

08:03.275 --> 08:04.474
Well, but so is
painting the walls in here

08:04.475 --> 08:06.508
with you people's tiny brains.

08:06.509 --> 08:10.274
[all gasp] Yeah, so whaddya
say we "get crackin'"?

08:10.275 --> 08:11.608
[chuckles]

08:11.609 --> 08:14.508
See what I did there?
Pun-wise?

08:14.509 --> 08:18.307
Samuel Johnson tells us that puns
are the lowest form of comedy,

08:18.308 --> 08:20.542
but for me it's murder.

08:28.390 --> 08:30.756
[Archer] Damn it, people, my
mother is buried alive!

08:30.757 --> 08:32.756
What is taking so long?

08:32.756 --> 08:34.589
We're going as fast as we can!

08:34.590 --> 08:36.456
And why is it so frickin' hot?

08:36.457 --> 08:37.589
What? Why do you think?

08:37.590 --> 08:38.722
To crack the password we need

08:38.724 --> 08:40.756
every last bit of
this computing power!

08:40.756 --> 08:42.822
Still though...
It is pretty hot.

08:42.823 --> 08:44.922
Sweet Jesus Metal Christ!
Whoa, my God!

08:44.923 --> 08:46.822
What's the matter?
C'mon, Lana.

08:46.823 --> 08:48.523
It's nothing you haven't seen before.

08:48.524 --> 08:49.855
Wait, what?
Yeah, dude,

08:49.856 --> 08:52.556
me and her b-b-b-boned. What?

08:52.557 --> 08:54.556
Did I know this?
When was this?

08:54.557 --> 08:56.756
Way back!
When he was, ya know...

08:56.757 --> 08:59.723
What, back when
I was what, Lana? Human?

08:59.724 --> 09:01.723
I mean--
I still have feelings!

09:01.724 --> 09:03.723
Well, then put some damn clothes on!

09:03.724 --> 09:05.723
No, no!
You can just feast

09:05.724 --> 09:09.689
your beady little eyes
on my... endoskeleton!

09:09.690 --> 09:12.889
[excitedly gasps] Here's an idea!
Turn on the A/C!

09:12.890 --> 09:14.589
[Pam]
Yeah, right!

09:14.590 --> 09:16.855
We're way over maximum voltage.

09:16.856 --> 09:18.689
I got about
a buck-fifty in pennies

09:18.690 --> 09:20.556
crammed in the fusebox as it is.

09:20.557 --> 09:22.822
[all groaning]
Oh, relax.

09:22.823 --> 09:24.889
Worst case, an innocent
migrant farmhand

09:24.890 --> 09:27.789
goes to turn on the milking
machine and gets electrocuted.

09:27.790 --> 09:30.589
What? I mean, worst case
we fry some circuits.

09:30.590 --> 09:31.789
Hmm...
What?

09:31.790 --> 09:33.556
I mean, how's Mother?

09:33.557 --> 09:35.689
I wanna see her,
put her up on the monitor.

09:35.690 --> 09:37.789
Okay!
But just for a second.

09:37.790 --> 09:40.523
Oh and keep it
on "mute." Carol.

09:40.524 --> 09:43.556
[all groaning]
[Barry chuckles]

09:43.557 --> 09:46.422
Yeah, she's really losing her shit.

09:46.423 --> 09:47.822
...hunt you bastards down

09:47.823 --> 09:49.889
and have your guts for
garters, you hear me?

09:49.890 --> 09:52.489
My God, get it together.

09:52.490 --> 09:54.789
You've been in tighter spots
than this.

09:54.790 --> 09:59.456
East Berlin, Warsaw.
Ugh, Khartoum?

09:59.457 --> 10:01.789
At least this time you're not
hooked up to a car battery.

10:01.790 --> 10:04.456
Or up to your ankles in camel blood.

10:04.457 --> 10:05.789
And whoever these bastards are,

10:05.790 --> 10:08.623
they must not want you dead just yet.

10:08.624 --> 10:12.389
But what do they want?
And where is this?

10:12.390 --> 10:13.723
[sighs] Well, it's
hard to say, really.

10:13.724 --> 10:16.389
I mean, we're computating
as fast as we can,

10:16.390 --> 10:18.456
but every possible
permutation of this password

10:18.457 --> 10:20.822
is something on the order of
ten to the ninth power, so--

10:20.823 --> 10:22.789
Got it! Wait, what? Wait, what?

10:22.790 --> 10:25.389
[muttering]
Whoo!

10:25.390 --> 10:26.723
Can't hear anything.

10:26.724 --> 10:29.656
Although I can feel just
the slightest draft, but...

10:29.657 --> 10:33.422
[deep sniff] Hm. Maybe
a hint of diesel?

10:33.423 --> 10:35.456
Doesn't help much,
that could be anywhere.

10:35.457 --> 10:38.589
Although "anywhere" usually
has some kind of sounds.

10:38.590 --> 10:42.756
Traffic, birds, a train.
Here there's just nothing.

10:42.757 --> 10:45.756
Could-- Damn it,
I'm underground!

10:45.757 --> 10:48.855
But what kind of
sick, twisted, bastard...

10:48.856 --> 10:51.855
Whoo! Barry's
baggin' some tea!

10:51.856 --> 10:54.589
[thrusting sounds]

10:54.590 --> 10:56.456
I suppose there's really no telling.

10:56.457 --> 10:57.855
You spend your whole
life in espionage,

10:57.856 --> 11:00.422
you're going to make a few enemies.

11:00.423 --> 11:03.422
But kiddo, you're not gonna
sit here on your keister

11:03.423 --> 11:07.690
waiting to find out who's
behind this. So. Step one.

11:12.457 --> 11:14.523
And now for step two.

11:14.524 --> 11:17.422
[inhales, grunts]

11:17.423 --> 11:20.523
[exhales] Step two's always a bitch.

11:20.524 --> 11:22.822
All right, now step three.

11:22.823 --> 11:24.724
[grunting]

11:27.423 --> 11:28.723
[Barry] Okay, so now what, now what?

11:28.724 --> 11:30.689
Well, I think the first
thing we should do

11:30.690 --> 11:32.723
is make Pam put on some clothes.

11:32.724 --> 11:34.556
Don't try to body shame me!

11:34.557 --> 11:35.822
Dog Tits!
Yeah, shut up.

11:35.823 --> 11:38.389
[sighs] So now, we have to go through

11:38.390 --> 11:40.822
all these millions
of records line by line,

11:40.823 --> 11:42.889
looking for any records
with your given name,

11:42.890 --> 11:45.556
and hope we can
cross-reference that

11:45.557 --> 11:47.689
to find some record of
your birth mother's name.

11:47.690 --> 11:49.556
What? How long is
that gonna take?

11:49.557 --> 11:51.623
I-- Awhile, Archer.

11:51.624 --> 11:53.556
Oh, well then, can I borrow Krieger?

11:53.557 --> 11:55.589
No. How does that help the situation?

11:55.590 --> 11:56.789
It helps my leg, Cyril,

11:56.790 --> 11:58.889
which I think might be
turning septic,

11:58.890 --> 12:01.656
thanks to your new
best friend, Darth Barry!

12:01.657 --> 12:03.789
You do realize I'm not
that kind of a doc--

12:03.790 --> 12:07.689
Krieger, break room now, goddamn it!
So, is it cool if I--

12:07.690 --> 12:10.556
Yeah, but give him some morphine
or something to shut him up,

12:10.557 --> 12:13.556
'cause I've really got this warm,
hopeful feeling right now,

12:13.557 --> 12:15.523
and I kinda feel like
it's gonna be ruined

12:15.524 --> 12:18.523
if I have to pull his spine
out through his face.

12:18.524 --> 12:21.523
Um, and also can I go
to the bathroom? No.

12:21.524 --> 12:23.756
Then why does Archer get
to do whatever he wants

12:23.757 --> 12:26.855
plus morphine when you're not
even my robot supervisor!

12:26.856 --> 12:30.623
Okay, Jesus, go to the bathroom.

12:30.624 --> 12:33.822
Well, if she's going-- Everybody
go to the damn bathroom!

12:33.823 --> 12:36.556
Go crazy, use the frickin' bidet!

12:36.557 --> 12:39.389
I'm not the one
running out of oxygen here.

12:39.390 --> 12:41.589
Oh right, I forgot about Miss Archer.

12:41.590 --> 12:44.689
Although...
[grunts]

12:44.690 --> 12:47.822
step three's no prize.
[groans]

12:47.823 --> 12:49.822
Aha!

12:49.823 --> 12:52.822
And now, for these damn cuffs!

12:52.823 --> 12:54.523
[Krieger]
You lost me.

12:54.524 --> 12:56.889
I want you to Edison this elephant.

12:56.890 --> 13:00.789
Ooo-kay.
Nope, still lost.

13:00.790 --> 13:03.756
Thomas Edison! Remember?
When he killed that elephant

13:03.757 --> 13:06.656
by jamming a big, fat
electric cable up its asshole?

13:06.657 --> 13:08.523
What?
Yeah.

13:08.524 --> 13:10.489
The kindly Wizard of Menlo Park,

13:10.490 --> 13:12.689
bought a sweet old circus
elephant just to murder it.

13:12.690 --> 13:14.756
Now I want you to figure
out a way to zap Barry

13:14.757 --> 13:17.422
with enough juice
to shut down his CPU.

13:17.423 --> 13:21.456
Uh, okay, like-- Like, just brick him.
[zapping sound]

13:21.457 --> 13:24.556
But the KGB built him. I'm sure
all his circuits are shielded.

13:24.557 --> 13:26.723
It would take like,
gigawatts worth of volts.

13:26.724 --> 13:29.523
Okay, that doesn't sound right.
It's not.

13:29.524 --> 13:30.689
But how many volts do
you think we have with

13:30.690 --> 13:32.723
two pounds of pennies
jammed in the fusebox?

13:32.724 --> 13:35.556
Hmm, and if I routed it
all to a single circuit,

13:35.557 --> 13:37.389
like the dimmer switch
in the bullpen,

13:37.390 --> 13:39.723
maybe spilled an electrolytic
solution on the floor

13:39.724 --> 13:42.556
for good measure, and get Barry
to touch said dimmer switch...

13:42.557 --> 13:44.456
Wait, what happened to jamming

13:44.457 --> 13:46.689
a big, fat electric
cable up his asshole?

13:46.690 --> 13:49.689
Well, A, I don't think he even has
an asshole, not that I was looking,

13:49.690 --> 13:51.855
and B, a dimmer switch is way easier.

13:51.856 --> 13:54.623
Okay, but-- But wait,
if you fry Barry's CPU,

13:54.624 --> 13:56.523
he can't tell you
where Miss Archer is!

13:56.524 --> 13:58.855
Well, I'll worry about that
bridge when I come to it!

13:58.856 --> 14:01.556
I kinda think you should
worry about it before then.

14:01.557 --> 14:03.822
Krieger, if I worried about
a fraction of the stuff

14:03.823 --> 14:06.656
I should be worried about,
I'd never get anything done!

14:06.657 --> 14:08.689
I know, but--
Oh my God, BPA!

14:08.690 --> 14:10.790
I--
Transgendered frogs!

14:13.757 --> 14:17.456
[frog bribbit]
Shh, shh, shh.

14:17.457 --> 14:19.789
[Gillette] What? I said
I'm in love with Barry.

14:19.790 --> 14:22.523
[toilet flushes] [laughs]
I knew that was coming.

14:22.524 --> 14:25.889
Oh, my tits, what? How could--
He's a frickin machine!

14:25.890 --> 14:27.855
Well, Ray, a machine
is like a desert.

14:27.856 --> 14:29.756
Either it fascinates or appalls you.

14:29.757 --> 14:32.556
What? It's not "noice!"
Noyce.

14:32.557 --> 14:34.789
How could you be attracted
to a homicidal maniac?

14:34.790 --> 14:37.489
No, that's a quote by Wilfrid Noyce.

14:37.490 --> 14:39.589
Really?
What? Yes!

14:39.590 --> 14:41.723
The mountaineer?
Yes!

14:41.724 --> 14:43.656
Well, here's a quote by me:

14:43.657 --> 14:45.889
Barry's about to violate
the First Law of Robotics...

14:45.890 --> 14:47.855
[whispers]
on my vagina.

14:47.856 --> 14:49.855
[chuckling]
Noice.

14:49.856 --> 14:54.489
Ha! Now just to see
where the hell I am...

14:54.490 --> 14:56.723
What? Oh, for the love!

14:56.724 --> 15:00.889
Although, no matter who
or what ends up killing me,

15:00.890 --> 15:03.623
you could probably
paint that on the wall.

15:03.624 --> 15:06.490
The idiot.

15:12.849 --> 15:15.589
Let's go, people.
The clock is ticking.

15:15.709 --> 15:17.165
Tick tock, tick tock.

15:17.249 --> 15:18.414
Name something a clock would say.

15:18.415 --> 15:20.348
Barry, you could, ya know, help!

15:20.349 --> 15:21.648
[chuckles]
I'm too wound up!

15:21.649 --> 15:23.648
Name something a clock would--
Ray.

15:23.649 --> 15:27.148
Seriously.
I could maybe help you unwind.

15:27.149 --> 15:30.214
[Lana] Ugh. Didn't I
murder you one time?

15:30.215 --> 15:32.314
Maybe...
[Archer] Carol!

15:32.315 --> 15:34.581
Get back to work, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

15:34.582 --> 15:37.281
Well, you guys were
all pretty sweaty,

15:37.282 --> 15:39.648
so I brought you
some Sports Drank to--

15:39.649 --> 15:44.214
Oh, damn it! Damn.
Damn. Damn. Damn it!

15:44.215 --> 15:45.681
Probably because
it's so dark in here.

15:45.682 --> 15:47.548
Yeah, Archer, it is getting dark,

15:47.549 --> 15:49.281
which means your mommy is running out

15:49.282 --> 15:51.214
of both time and oxygen!

15:51.215 --> 15:54.214
It also means potentially
dangerous eye-strain

15:54.215 --> 15:55.548
for these hardworking folks, Barry.

15:55.549 --> 15:57.681
So why don't you go over there
and turn up that dimmer?

15:57.682 --> 16:00.448
You turn up the damn dimmer!
No, Barry, you do it!

16:00.449 --> 16:03.181
Ugh, Jesus, I'll turn up
the stupid dimmer.

16:03.182 --> 16:05.515
Carol, no! Don't touch that dimmer!
Wait a minute...

16:05.516 --> 16:08.348
Why do you want me
to touch the light switch?

16:08.349 --> 16:11.448
Hm? And all the sports drank
conveniently spilled

16:11.449 --> 16:13.615
on the floor, full of electrolytes?

16:13.616 --> 16:16.348
Is it? Are you trying
to electrocute me?

16:16.349 --> 16:18.348
[gasps]
What, no!

16:18.349 --> 16:21.314
[Krieger screams]
[sighs] Apparently not.

16:21.315 --> 16:24.381
If I was electrocuted, how the hell
were you gonna find your mother?

16:24.382 --> 16:26.214
So there were a couple of holes!

16:26.215 --> 16:28.181
[Pam] Wait, are we doing-- Jesus!

16:28.182 --> 16:32.181
You were willing to risk that?
Oh, that is classic you!

16:32.182 --> 16:33.548
A mother!
The one thing

16:33.549 --> 16:36.414
I've been searching for
my entire goddamn life,

16:36.415 --> 16:37.648
and you take it for granted!

16:37.649 --> 16:39.481
Just like you do
with everything else!

16:39.482 --> 16:41.248
Shut up!
Well, guess what!

16:41.249 --> 16:42.648
You take your mother
for granted? Fine!

16:42.649 --> 16:45.348
Good luck finding her
without the coordinates!

16:45.349 --> 16:47.214
[all gasping]
What the shit?

16:47.215 --> 16:49.415
I don't think that's
gonna be a problem.

16:51.282 --> 16:55.248
[exhales] First thing, I'm
taking a long hot bath

16:55.249 --> 16:57.381
with a nice stiff drink.

16:57.382 --> 17:00.581
[grunts]

17:00.582 --> 17:04.348
And then I'm going to kill everybody!

17:04.348 --> 17:06.414
Yeah?
Well, get in line, lady!

17:06.415 --> 17:08.414
[all]
Hey, whoa! Calm down!

17:08.415 --> 17:11.214
After I kill
all you idiots, I'm--

17:11.214 --> 17:12.647
- [Pam] I found her!
- [All muttering]

17:12.648 --> 17:16.414
Found who? Your mom! At
least I think I did.

17:16.415 --> 17:18.615
[all chattering]
Let me see.

17:18.616 --> 17:21.515
So, the Hide-A-Wee
Home For Children...

17:21.516 --> 17:24.314
That's where I grew up!
Took in a newborn baby,

17:24.315 --> 17:26.548
born at County Hospital
close to your dates,

17:26.549 --> 17:29.381
who was christened
Bartholomew Aloysius Dylan.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.548
That's me!
Little baby Barty D.!

17:31.549 --> 17:33.581
And, according to
County Hospital's records,

17:33.582 --> 17:37.615
the baby was put up for adoption
by a young woman named...

17:37.616 --> 17:39.515
You sure you wanna know this?

17:39.516 --> 17:41.582
[gunfire]
[all clamoring]

17:44.182 --> 17:45.548
Yeah.
[sighs]

17:45.549 --> 17:49.481
Tammy Jo Stamps, age 16.

17:49.482 --> 17:50.715
Holy shitsnacks!

17:50.716 --> 17:52.615
And she's still alive, you guys!

17:52.616 --> 17:54.248
She lives in L.A.!

17:54.249 --> 17:55.581
[all muttering]

17:55.582 --> 17:59.448
[bawling] Well? What
are you waiting for?

17:59.449 --> 18:01.515
You got what you wanted!

18:01.516 --> 18:04.214
Go to her!

18:04.215 --> 18:05.681
Just go!

18:05.682 --> 18:09.248
I mean, yeah, right?
I mean, right?

18:09.249 --> 18:11.314
Well, I mean, yeah, but...

18:11.315 --> 18:14.381
But what? I mean, you
can't go like that.

18:14.382 --> 18:15.515
Why, what are you...

18:15.516 --> 18:18.314
Oh my God, I look
like the Terminator!

18:18.315 --> 18:20.214
Well, a Terminator.

18:20.215 --> 18:23.615
I think I may have just the thing.

18:23.616 --> 18:25.581
Okay, I was kinda saving this for...

18:25.582 --> 18:28.515
this other thing, but anyhoo.

18:28.516 --> 18:30.581
[all gasping]

18:30.582 --> 18:32.515
What the shit, Krieger?

18:32.516 --> 18:34.281
What?

18:34.282 --> 18:38.281
Why do you have our heads?

18:38.282 --> 18:41.515
And hands. What, it's for this other...
nothing.

18:41.516 --> 18:45.248
So! Who's it
gonna be, big guy?

18:45.249 --> 18:46.715
[chuckling]

18:46.716 --> 18:49.515
Holy shit, now I know you're crazy.

18:49.516 --> 18:51.414
What, you thought I'd pick you?

18:51.415 --> 18:52.648
I mean...
Or Gillette?

18:52.649 --> 18:55.314
[chuckles] The poor
man's Frank Langella?

18:55.315 --> 18:56.548
Oh my God, I am.

18:56.549 --> 18:59.581
No, this is the face.
How do I look?

18:59.582 --> 19:02.381
[all muttering]

19:02.382 --> 19:04.448
Yeah, right?
Okay, so...

19:04.449 --> 19:07.481
Wow! Off to meet
my birth mother.

19:07.482 --> 19:11.214
Wish me luck, friends!
[all] Good luck.

19:11.215 --> 19:12.581
[chuckles]
Thanks, guys!

19:12.582 --> 19:15.349
[brakes screeching]
[all] Oh!

19:20.482 --> 19:22.281
[Barry]
I'm okay!

19:22.282 --> 19:23.548
[sarcastic muttering]

19:23.549 --> 19:27.414
[sighs]
Like a bad penny.

19:27.534 --> 19:30.215
Oh, shit!
The pennies!

19:38.683 --> 19:41.583
[Lana]
So, what did we learn?

19:41.584 --> 19:42.782
[muttering]

19:42.783 --> 19:45.090
I learned...
Wow.

19:45.210 --> 19:46.749
Nothing?
Nope.

19:46.750 --> 19:48.416
I learned that the cabinet

19:48.417 --> 19:50.483
of Dr. Krieger is
full of our faces.

19:50.484 --> 19:52.649
And hands.
I-- Look,

19:52.650 --> 19:55.416
don't worry about it. I
really feel like we should.

19:55.417 --> 19:57.682
Oh, you worry about everything.

19:57.683 --> 19:59.882
Oh, shit!
I hope Mother's okay.

19:59.883 --> 20:01.617
[dopey laugh]

20:03.817 --> 20:06.145
[trucker]
Evenin'.

20:06.265 --> 20:09.782
I'll give you $1,000 for a
ride to the nearest bar.

20:09.783 --> 20:11.483
[trucker laughs]
What?

20:11.484 --> 20:13.749
Oh, shit yeah, lady, climb on up!

20:13.750 --> 20:17.583
[groans] Yeah, there ya
go, get on up in here.

20:17.584 --> 20:20.616
[Malory groans]
Whew. Thank you.

20:20.617 --> 20:23.682
[trucker chuckles] Thank you.
A thousand bucks?

20:23.683 --> 20:26.550
You're either crazy or rich or both.

20:26.551 --> 20:29.583
[Malory] Well, I don't have
it on me obviously, but...

20:29.584 --> 20:32.616
[trucker] Oh, I betcha we
can work something out.

20:32.617 --> 20:36.550
[Malory] Ahem, your hand
seems to be on my thigh.

20:36.551 --> 20:39.583
[trucker] Yeah, you're
like a silver fox.

20:39.584 --> 20:40.782
[Malory]
I beg your pardon?

20:40.783 --> 20:42.616
[trucker]
And I'm just hopin'

20:42.617 --> 20:46.483
them curtains match the rug,
'cause I like that.

20:46.484 --> 20:48.416
[Malory sighs]

20:48.417 --> 20:49.516
[punching]

20:49.517 --> 20:51.583
[groans, chokes]

20:51.584 --> 20:52.782
[coughing]

20:52.783 --> 20:54.782
[Malory] Ya like an
elbow to the throat?

20:54.783 --> 20:57.550
Shit heel.

20:57.551 --> 21:01.416
Although, if you had worded
that a bit more delicately

21:01.417 --> 21:03.583
it could've been
quite flattering, so...

21:03.584 --> 21:06.816
well, not thank you,
necessarily, but...

21:06.817 --> 21:08.029
[choking]

21:08.149 --> 21:12.782
[Malory] Je ne sais quoi.
Exactement. Ciao!

21:12.783 --> 21:15.650
[continues choking]
