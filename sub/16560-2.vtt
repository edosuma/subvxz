WEBVTT

00:10.010 --> 00:12.637
Guys, cops come in,
find drugs in my club

00:12.721 --> 00:13.680
party's over for everybody.

00:13.763 --> 00:15.056
-Family, okay?
-Come on, man.

00:15.140 --> 00:16.891
Our boy's getting
ball and chained this weekend.

00:16.975 --> 00:18.476
Don't kill his buzz yet.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.520
Yo, I got to drain the dragon.

00:20.770 --> 00:22.981
Hey, keep the drinks coming.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.319
Stop following me.

00:29.362 --> 00:31.656
Get the... Get off me. Don't touch me.

00:37.287 --> 00:39.330
All right guys,
I got to call it a night.

00:39.414 --> 00:41.541
Unlike you degenerates
I have a wife at home.

00:41.624 --> 00:43.293
-What?
-No. No.

00:43.376 --> 00:45.628
-All right, all right.
-Travis, my man.

00:46.004 --> 00:47.338
Welcome to the club.

00:51.426 --> 00:54.054
Hey, babe, I'm on my way home.

00:54.137 --> 00:56.139
I love you. I'll see you soon.

00:56.222 --> 00:57.974
Fingers crossed, you're still awake.

01:00.477 --> 01:01.770
Damn it. It's after five.

01:02.437 --> 01:04.773
How'd it get so late
or I guess so early?

01:05.857 --> 01:07.901
One second, one second.
I think I found something.

01:07.984 --> 01:10.487
Eddie was pretty badly beaten
three months prior to his murder.

01:10.570 --> 01:13.198
-What are you looking at?
-His medical records from New York.

01:13.281 --> 01:16.242
He was admitted on broken ribs
or lacerations hyoid fracture.

01:16.326 --> 01:17.827
Rosie, that's impossible.

01:18.203 --> 01:20.038
I'd have noticed
if he came home beaten up.

01:21.331 --> 01:22.957
Here, let me see this.

01:25.376 --> 01:28.922
Wait a second. I remember the day.
It was a car accident.

01:29.005 --> 01:33.343
He fell asleep on the way home,
hit a guardrail. I met him at the ER.

01:33.426 --> 01:36.513
Look, Villa, Eddie may or may not
have been in a car accident.

01:36.596 --> 01:39.516
But prior to getting into that car
he got the crap beat out of him.

01:39.849 --> 01:42.018
-Are you saying he lied to me?
-Okay, look.

01:42.560 --> 01:44.854
See these cuts right here,
those are bite marks.

01:45.563 --> 01:46.981
Villa, cars don't bite.

01:51.069 --> 01:52.320
Detective Villa.

01:52.403 --> 01:54.572
Uh-oh. You sound irritated, detective.

01:54.906 --> 01:56.324
The sun's barely up.

01:56.407 --> 01:57.742
Did I wake you?

01:57.826 --> 01:59.494
Why are you calling, sir?

01:59.577 --> 02:03.164
"Sir"? Ouch. Thought we were
in a better place than that, but okay.

02:03.498 --> 02:05.542
We got a dead victim
down in East Marl Marsh.

02:05.625 --> 02:06.668
I need you to get down there.

02:06.751 --> 02:08.294
That's all the way across town.

02:08.378 --> 02:09.921
Isn't there anyone closer?

02:10.004 --> 02:11.464
I need you on this one. I trust you.

02:11.548 --> 02:13.925
I'm still trying to figure out
the rest of the department.

02:14.509 --> 02:17.428
Fine. I'll meet you there.

02:17.512 --> 02:19.889
No, not this time.
The sun's barely up, right, Detective?

02:19.973 --> 02:22.559
Someone should enjoy their coffee
and be well rested for the day.

02:22.642 --> 02:23.768
You just keep me posted.

02:27.856 --> 02:30.483
See, isn't this better than
driving that boxy blue standard issue

02:30.567 --> 02:31.484
joy killer you have?

02:31.568 --> 02:33.361
I can't believe
you made me draw straws, Rosie.

02:33.444 --> 02:35.697
What are you, 12?
And my car doesn't kill joy.

02:35.780 --> 02:37.157
Killjoy.

02:37.740 --> 02:40.034
-I just named your car. Killjoy.
-Whatever.

02:40.118 --> 02:41.870
You haven't even been assigned
to this case.

02:41.953 --> 02:44.622
Come on now, Villa.
You, me workin' a crime scene.

02:44.706 --> 02:45.999
That's our happy place.

02:46.249 --> 02:48.585
-Wait, is that weird?
-You know what would make me happy?

02:48.668 --> 02:51.171
If Hornstock was back in command
and Slade

02:51.254 --> 02:54.090
crawled back into whatever men's
fashion magazine he popped out off.

02:54.174 --> 02:57.468
I think we both know that Slade isn't
who you're really mad at right now.

02:57.552 --> 03:00.346
Eddie got mixed up in something shady
and lied to me about it.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.265
You don't know that for sure.

03:02.724 --> 03:06.144
Okay, intentionally crashing your car
so you don't have to explain

03:06.227 --> 03:09.189
to your wife why you got your ass
whooped is a little extreme, I agree.

03:09.272 --> 03:11.316
I mean, if you'd asked me
a month ago

03:11.399 --> 03:14.068
I would have sworn Eddie and I
had no secrets from each other.

03:14.152 --> 03:16.446
Now I'm beginning to think
I didn't know my husband at all.

03:28.708 --> 03:29.626
What're you guys doing here?

03:29.709 --> 03:31.169
I was about to ask you the same thing.

03:31.294 --> 03:33.671
-Slade sent me.
-I'm just her driver. We drew straws.

03:33.755 --> 03:36.799
What? No Diaper bag? No binky?
No sippy cup?

03:36.883 --> 03:38.509
Cap, he didn't send me
to babysit you.

03:39.093 --> 03:41.554
Yeah, sure he didn't.
And it's detective, get used to it.

03:41.638 --> 03:43.848
Here's the vic's wallet,
name's Danny Williams.

03:43.973 --> 03:45.016
Go to town.

03:52.523 --> 03:53.608
What are you doin'?

03:54.400 --> 03:57.528
Daisy said, oranges and apples
are good for relieving stress.

03:57.862 --> 04:00.448
Daisy said that.
Don't do that, you look crazy.

04:01.616 --> 04:02.867
Anyone seen anything?

04:03.952 --> 04:07.247
Couple of teens looking for privacy
stumbled on the scene,

04:07.330 --> 04:08.498
called it in.

04:09.123 --> 04:11.000
Rosie, slow down.
You haven't been assigned this case.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.878
Well, I'm here, I might as well
make myself useful, free of charge.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.299
Villa, you all right?

04:19.801 --> 04:22.011
He's wearing a wedding ring.

04:23.429 --> 04:25.556
Some poor woman is waiting
for her husband to come home

04:25.640 --> 04:27.100
and now that's not gonna happen.

04:27.392 --> 04:29.310
-Need a minute?
-No, I have to do my job.

04:29.727 --> 04:32.063
-No signs of struggle in the car.
-Or on the victim.

04:32.146 --> 04:33.690
Door locks weren't tampered with.

04:33.773 --> 04:35.525
Nor are there needle marks in his arm.

04:35.900 --> 04:38.361
Maybe, the victim's first time
shooting up and it went wrong.

04:38.736 --> 04:40.530
Are you gonna just keep clawing
at the victim like that

04:40.613 --> 04:43.157
or you want to say something
and make this a little less creepy?

04:43.241 --> 04:46.494
Danny Williams
was a recovering addict.

04:46.786 --> 04:49.414
He had calluses on his thumb and
middle finger from repetitive rubbing.

04:49.497 --> 04:50.999
Often seen in crack users.

04:51.082 --> 04:53.543
He also had scar tissue
in between his toes

04:53.626 --> 04:54.961
where he used to inject himself.

04:55.044 --> 04:58.047
All right, so our guy was a junkie
who fell off the wagon and OD'd.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.508
But there's something about this setup
that seems a little too clean.

05:00.591 --> 05:02.885
I mean, all of his scars
are in hidden places.

05:02.969 --> 05:05.555
Why all of a sudden decide
to shoot up in the middle of your arm?

05:05.638 --> 05:07.432
Because Danny Williams
didn't inject himself.

05:07.849 --> 05:09.475
There are no teeth marks
on the tourniquet.

05:09.559 --> 05:11.519
He couldn't have tied it
that tight with one hand.

05:11.602 --> 05:13.730
Exactly. There were calluses
on his left hand which is

05:13.813 --> 05:15.148
his dominant hand which means...

05:15.231 --> 05:17.358
He would inject himself
in his right arm not his left.

05:17.442 --> 05:18.818
The guy had help killing himself.

05:19.235 --> 05:21.154
And where I come from
there's a word for that...

05:22.238 --> 05:23.156
Murder.

05:37.128 --> 05:39.505
So, you're saying
this wasn't an accidental overdose?

05:39.589 --> 05:42.258
Whoever killed Danny Williams
knew about his history of drug abuse.

05:42.467 --> 05:43.676
It's a good thing I sent you out to

05:43.760 --> 05:44.761
-the crime scene.
-Here you are, Captain.

05:44.844 --> 05:45.762
Thank you, Sydney.

05:45.845 --> 05:48.139
Hornstock would have reached
the same conclusion without me.

05:48.222 --> 05:49.640
He had the scene under control.

05:49.724 --> 05:52.810
Come on, Villa. You know an extra set
of eyes is always good on a scene.

05:52.894 --> 05:55.396
And, Captain, I really appreciate you
looking out for me.

05:57.815 --> 05:59.067
Next time send more.

05:59.400 --> 06:02.862
Oh, I wouldn't have taken you
for a hugger. But I like it.

06:02.945 --> 06:06.199
Hey, it's a new day, new Captain.
Why not a new me, right?

06:06.616 --> 06:10.578
Okay, we found a set of prints
on the syringe at the scene.

06:10.661 --> 06:11.871
We're running them now.

06:12.121 --> 06:13.790
With any luck, our killer was sloppy.

06:14.040 --> 06:17.168
Wow. I mean, that would really
make it our lucky day, wouldn't it?

06:17.543 --> 06:19.629
But, hey, something clearly
is in the air this morning,

06:19.712 --> 06:21.631
so why don't we just
keep our fingers crossed.

06:21.839 --> 06:23.383
Villa, talk to the victim's wife,
all right.

06:23.466 --> 06:26.677
See if she can shed some light on to
what her husband was involved in.

06:26.969 --> 06:28.846
Hornstock, why don't you stay on those
magical prints

06:28.930 --> 06:30.807
and process the paperwork
from the crime scene.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.683
My gift to you. No need for a hug.

06:32.767 --> 06:35.812
Paper work? Captain, that's crazy.
I need Hornstock in the field with me.

06:35.895 --> 06:37.980
Villa, it's all good.

06:38.356 --> 06:39.774
Prints and paperwork it is.

06:41.776 --> 06:44.237
Prints and paperwork. The double P.

06:46.739 --> 06:50.159
The EMPD identified traces of heroin
in the syringe in his arm.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.370
Well, we need to run a full toxicology
on the victim.

06:52.453 --> 06:55.164
I need to know exactly how much heroin
was injected into him

06:55.248 --> 06:56.332
and what it was mixed with.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.085
If this is street heroin we might
figure out where our killer got it.

06:59.168 --> 07:00.336
I'll get right on it.

07:00.711 --> 07:01.629
Actually, I can do it.

07:01.712 --> 07:03.256
'Cause you guys need
to dive into the autopsy,

07:03.339 --> 07:04.841
so this is me written all over it.

07:04.924 --> 07:06.926
Actually, Tee,
that's not really your specialty.

07:07.009 --> 07:08.970
Look, we all know
whose specialty this is,

07:09.053 --> 07:11.389
we all know
why she's not here to do it, okay.

07:11.472 --> 07:12.682
End of discussion.

07:12.765 --> 07:15.226
Unless, you want
to keep talking about it.

07:15.309 --> 07:17.895
'Cause you are the boss,
you can fire me.

07:20.356 --> 07:21.732
Thanks.

07:26.988 --> 07:29.073
-Should I go offer some help?
-No, no. Let her do it.

07:29.157 --> 07:31.742
She misses Pipp and
this will help her feel closer to her.

07:33.244 --> 07:35.246
This victim worked
in a hardware store, right?

07:35.621 --> 07:37.999
His hair is dyed
and his nails are manicured.

07:38.082 --> 07:39.750
And this confuses you because...

07:39.834 --> 07:42.170
No, he seems awfully well groomed
for an average Joe.

07:42.253 --> 07:44.755
I can appreciate a man who takes care
of his personal grooming.

07:44.839 --> 07:46.716
Oh, no. With that I completely agree.

07:47.049 --> 07:48.843
I know it's hard to tell,
but I wasn't always into the

07:48.926 --> 07:50.219
whole personal grooming thing.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.972
My ex-girlfriend
used to call me Mogwai.

07:54.432 --> 07:56.017
Mogwai, like Gremlins.

07:57.935 --> 07:59.270
Gizmo... Never mind.

08:00.813 --> 08:02.940
-I worry about you sometimes.
-I worry about me, too.

08:04.233 --> 08:05.776
You've done so much for me.

08:06.360 --> 08:09.655
I'm grateful for my new lawyer
which I promise I will pay you back.

08:10.907 --> 08:13.910
But, you know, I'm just afraid this
whole thing's takin' a toll on you.

08:14.285 --> 08:16.245
I'm fine. I promise.

08:16.329 --> 08:19.457
Now, what I need you to do
is to tell Rebecca

08:19.540 --> 08:22.710
that it's okay to release
the victim's autopsy files.

08:22.793 --> 08:24.879
She says she can't do it
without your consent.

08:25.296 --> 08:26.714
I'm sorry, I can't.

08:27.757 --> 08:30.510
I instructed Rebecca
to keep the files away from you.

08:31.636 --> 08:32.970
Why would you do that?

08:33.387 --> 08:34.597
They're graphic.

08:36.182 --> 08:39.435
You know, it's one thing
to read the court transcripts

08:39.519 --> 08:42.063
and to hear about them,
but it's a whole other thing

08:42.146 --> 08:46.609
when you see for yourself
in these detailed photos.

08:46.692 --> 08:48.986
Gerald, you're innocent.

08:49.862 --> 08:54.492
My son is the best pathologist
in this entire state.

08:54.825 --> 08:57.745
You mean, the son
who still doesn't know I exist?

08:59.997 --> 09:02.750
-It's complicated.
-Why are you here, Donna?

09:05.503 --> 09:07.547
Why are you risking everything
to help me?

09:10.424 --> 09:14.762
The letter you wrote to my son
wasn't about clearing your name.

09:15.846 --> 09:19.684
Your only concern
is closure for the victims.

09:20.434 --> 09:22.979
That their souls wouldn't
truly rest in peace

09:23.062 --> 09:25.648
until their real killer was found.

09:26.566 --> 09:31.904
That spirituality in the face
of everything that has happened to you.

09:33.614 --> 09:35.157
I don't know, I just...

09:37.410 --> 09:40.913
I... I can't turn my back on that.

09:44.875 --> 09:48.170
So, let me help you.

09:51.424 --> 09:56.887
Look... Look, you've done
more than enough for me, Donna.

09:58.347 --> 10:00.099
At great personal cost.

10:02.393 --> 10:04.020
Go back to living your life.

10:09.191 --> 10:11.819
I hear what you're saying,
but it's doesn't make sense.

10:11.902 --> 10:14.739
There is no version
of Danny being dead that makes sense.

10:14.822 --> 10:17.783
Did Danny have any enemies,
anyone he had an issue with recently?

10:17.992 --> 10:19.952
No, everyone loved Danny.

10:20.036 --> 10:21.871
Well, clearly not everyone.

10:22.496 --> 10:23.914
-Villa.
-That's okay.

10:25.249 --> 10:26.334
She's right.

10:27.043 --> 10:29.420
Someone killed Danny and me
sitting here sugar coating things

10:29.503 --> 10:31.255
isn't gonna help you
find who killed him.

10:31.589 --> 10:34.133
Was your husband's history
of drug abuse public knowledge?

10:34.967 --> 10:37.470
-Danny didn't use drugs.
-I'm afraid he did.

10:38.346 --> 10:40.848
He was a recovering addict
and whoever killed him knew that.

10:41.474 --> 10:44.185
He was my husband. Don't you think
I would notice something like that?

10:44.268 --> 10:46.979
You wouldn't be the first wife
who found out her husband was...

10:48.397 --> 10:49.774
a guy with some secrets.

10:50.441 --> 10:51.651
Could you excuse us please?

10:53.653 --> 10:56.238
-What? What is your problem?
-What is my problem?

10:56.322 --> 10:58.908
Look, Villa, I know this is hitting
a little close to home, okay.

10:58.991 --> 11:00.910
If you don't stop doing your best
Azealia Banks impersonation

11:01.077 --> 11:03.204
you're gonna find yourself in the car
while Jenny and I finish talking.

11:03.287 --> 11:04.580
You cannot put me in a time out.

11:04.747 --> 11:06.791
-I'm the one with the badge.
-You're the one with...

11:08.834 --> 11:10.670
Sorry about that.

11:10.878 --> 11:13.589
Can you tell me where
Danny was last night?

11:14.006 --> 11:16.133
He was at a bachelor party
at China's Den.

11:16.217 --> 11:18.094
He left a message saying
he was coming home.

11:19.345 --> 11:20.763
And he never made it.

11:20.846 --> 11:23.516
Danny was the perfect guy
I'd waited my whole life for.

11:24.350 --> 11:27.103
He was funny and loving and generous.

11:28.479 --> 11:29.814
And now he's gone.

11:31.399 --> 11:32.775
How is that fair?

11:35.194 --> 11:36.612
It's not.

11:46.330 --> 11:48.916
You know, I don't get
the whole strip club thing.

11:48.999 --> 11:51.752
It's a bunch of drunk guys
hollering at a girl

11:51.836 --> 11:53.504
as she takes her clothes off
for money.

11:53.587 --> 11:56.298
Not exactly what the feminists
of the sexual revolution had in mind.

11:56.382 --> 11:59.009
-No, not exactly.
-Hey, Rosie. Good to see you.

11:59.093 --> 12:01.303
Liz, hey, like the new hair.

12:01.387 --> 12:02.972
-I like, I like.
-You noticed.

12:03.848 --> 12:05.558
-Seriously...
-Well, first of all,

12:05.641 --> 12:08.352
it's medically proven that strip clubs
are good for men's health.

12:08.811 --> 12:10.688
They lower the cortisol,
which is a stress hormone

12:10.771 --> 12:13.357
and they boost the oxitocin
which is the love hormone.

12:13.441 --> 12:16.110
Right, and in which medical journal
did you read that in, Playboy?

12:16.193 --> 12:17.820
-Second of all--
-Rosie.

12:18.320 --> 12:19.739
Luke, what's up, my man.

12:20.072 --> 12:21.615
We're here on official business.

12:21.699 --> 12:23.617
Do you remember seeing this guy here
last night?

12:23.701 --> 12:24.910
His name is Danny Williams.

12:24.994 --> 12:26.412
He was a part of a bachelor party.

12:26.495 --> 12:29.039
Yeah, his boys were here
partying pretty hard last night.

12:29.123 --> 12:31.083
-And Danny wasn't?
-I mean, he was drinking, yeah.

12:31.167 --> 12:33.210
-But he didn't touch the other stuff.
-Other stuff?

12:34.420 --> 12:36.714
Look, Luke, we're not here
to bust you. All right?

12:36.797 --> 12:38.966
We just... Danny Williams was murdered
last night.

12:39.049 --> 12:41.051
We wanna get down to the bottom
of what happened.

12:41.135 --> 12:42.428
Murdered?

12:43.471 --> 12:46.557
Look, his boys were doing coke.
I told them to get rid of it

12:46.640 --> 12:48.684
and Danny left shortly,
just right after that.

12:48.768 --> 12:49.935
-Was he by himself?
-Yeah.

12:50.019 --> 12:51.854
But he did get into some argument
with a random guy

12:51.937 --> 12:54.899
by the bathroom just before.
I have no idea what it's about, but...

12:54.982 --> 12:56.650
Okay, these security cameras working?

12:56.734 --> 12:59.028
-If so, I'm gonna need to tapes.
-Yeah, for sure.

13:03.407 --> 13:06.535
You know, whatever that computer
did to you I'm pretty sure it's sorry.

13:07.286 --> 13:08.579
What?

13:09.246 --> 13:11.999
-T, is everything good?
-Yeah, never better.

13:12.541 --> 13:14.293
Why wouldn't everything be good?

13:14.376 --> 13:16.128
It's better than good actually.
It's great.

13:16.212 --> 13:19.340
Everything is great.

13:20.424 --> 13:22.468
I'm pretty sure that's exactly
what Beyoncé said to Jay Z

13:22.551 --> 13:24.261
right before she dropped Lemonade.

13:25.721 --> 13:27.264
I'm a member of the Beyhive.

13:28.182 --> 13:29.308
We have a problem.

13:29.391 --> 13:32.603
The prints on the syringe
belong to a Connor Thorne.

13:32.686 --> 13:35.564
That's a lead. That's great. Which is
exactly the opposite of a problem.

13:36.023 --> 13:37.650
Meet Connor Thorne.

13:38.567 --> 13:41.320
-I though his name was Danny Williams.
-Danny was his fake name.

13:41.403 --> 13:44.573
-Ready for things to get even crazier?
-Because that wasn't crazy enough.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.909
Connor Thorne
already has a death certificate.

13:46.992 --> 13:49.161
He died three years ago
in Washington D.C.

13:49.245 --> 13:50.246
-He faked his death.
-Exactly.

13:50.329 --> 13:52.581
So either he has
the worst luck ever or...

13:52.665 --> 13:55.125
Whatever he was running from
finally caught up with him.

14:00.172 --> 14:02.716
This was a typical day in his life
back in D.C.

14:03.968 --> 14:05.719
His hair was darker? Man.

14:06.095 --> 14:10.057
Danny Williams. The perfect husband,
average Joe from the hardware store

14:10.140 --> 14:13.394
-was really a Jordan Belfort wanna be?
-Sheep in wolf's clothing.

14:17.189 --> 14:19.942
I just flipped an idiom.

14:20.609 --> 14:21.819
I know.

14:22.403 --> 14:24.780
Danny was a big time
hedge fund manager back in D.C.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.116
with a serious weakness for cars,
women and drugs.

14:27.199 --> 14:30.035
He started running
a mini made off like ponzi scheme.

14:30.119 --> 14:32.454
Embezzling clients' money
to pay for his lifestyle.

14:32.538 --> 14:34.498
When the SEC
and the Feds caught on to him,

14:34.582 --> 14:35.749
he faked his suicide.

14:35.833 --> 14:39.336
Several witnesses saw him walk into
the ocean down at Virginia beach.

14:39.795 --> 14:42.590
-No one saw him come out again.
-Got to give him points for ingenuity.

14:42.673 --> 14:43.883
No, we don't.

14:43.966 --> 14:47.511
Okay, Danny, Connor... whatever
the hell we're calling him, okay,

14:47.595 --> 14:49.513
received a lot of death threats
from his victims

14:49.597 --> 14:51.223
before his suicide.

14:51.307 --> 14:53.350
Maybe one of those victims
tracked him down to Miami

14:53.434 --> 14:54.602
and made good on their threats.

14:54.685 --> 14:56.896
Or killed him,
trying to get their money back.

14:56.979 --> 15:00.649
When he died the first time there was
over 2.5 million unaccounted for.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.152
See, that's what doesn't add up to me.

15:03.235 --> 15:05.905
The guy on my table, he didn't live
a life of luxury here in Miami.

15:05.988 --> 15:08.866
Lived a simple life, loved his wife,
took pleasure in the little things.

15:08.949 --> 15:09.783
So what are you saying?

15:09.867 --> 15:11.827
I'm saying whoever he was in D.C.,
he changed.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.162
Don't start with your whole

15:13.245 --> 15:15.456
rainbow prison,
with the unicorns and glitter...

15:15.539 --> 15:18.334
-No, more glitter, less bitter.
-No, people's lives were ruined.

15:18.417 --> 15:19.460
By Danny Williams.

15:19.543 --> 15:22.421
At least two of his victims committed
suicide after losing everything.

15:22.504 --> 15:25.883
He doesn't get to start over and play
house with some unsuspecting woman.

15:27.718 --> 15:29.929
You always get this fired up
over your cases, detective?

15:30.638 --> 15:32.806
Let's just say I have
a personal interest in this one.

15:32.890 --> 15:35.517
We need to talk to the wife again.
Right, Rosie.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.353
And I'm gonna hop on
the phone with the Feds

15:37.436 --> 15:38.812
and see about those death threats.

15:39.271 --> 15:40.731
Not so fast, detective.

15:41.231 --> 15:42.733
I have a special job for you.

15:45.569 --> 15:47.321
So these were sent over from the SEC.

15:47.404 --> 15:50.950
They are files on all 954 victims
of Connor Thorne's ponzi scheme.

15:51.075 --> 15:53.661
You want me to go through them
and come up with a list of suspects

15:53.744 --> 15:55.329
who could've got to him here in Miami.

15:55.746 --> 15:59.124
Smart man, Ira.
Go ahead, pump it.

16:00.125 --> 16:02.544
There you go. See, I knew
you were the right guy for the job.

16:03.837 --> 16:05.589
-What's wrong? Is there a problem?
-No.

16:07.216 --> 16:10.052
-I'll get started right away.
-Good man, Ira. Good man.

16:11.637 --> 16:13.097
Quick question, Cap.

16:14.390 --> 16:16.892
How does a trust fund kid
whose parents are still alive

16:16.976 --> 16:18.435
end up in a group home?

16:19.937 --> 16:21.939
I just had to know
who I was working for.

16:24.233 --> 16:25.901
Happy reading, Detective.

16:31.073 --> 16:34.284
Hey, Pipp, it's me.
Please don't delete this.

16:34.743 --> 16:38.247
I'm not calling to tell you
that I miss you or something.

16:38.330 --> 16:41.208
But I do, miss you.
But it's... Never mind.

16:42.167 --> 16:44.128
I'm calling for a reason
that's pretty important.

16:44.211 --> 16:45.879
I gotta-catch-a-murderer-quick
kinda important.

16:45.963 --> 16:48.298
I'm running tox on a victim
who OD'd on heroine.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.801
And I've run
a couple of different samples,

16:50.884 --> 16:53.220
but each time I get
a very different set of results.

16:53.595 --> 16:55.723
The 6-MAM all over the place,

16:55.806 --> 16:58.350
the O2 is like totally inconsistent.

16:58.434 --> 16:59.685
So what am I doing wrong?

16:59.768 --> 17:03.480
And I know that I can just,
you know, ask Mitchie,

17:03.564 --> 17:05.524
so I probably should just ask Mitchie.

17:05.607 --> 17:07.568
So, you know what,
forget that I called.

17:07.651 --> 17:10.946
Okay. Thanks. Sorry. Bye.

17:14.950 --> 17:15.909
Hey.

17:16.702 --> 17:17.786
Hi.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.789
Did that sound as pathetic as it felt?

17:20.873 --> 17:22.374
She just needs more time.

17:22.833 --> 17:25.127
Pippy has mastered the art
of avoidance.

17:25.210 --> 17:27.588
She will come around eventually.

17:28.547 --> 17:30.007
Must be like a family trait.

17:30.924 --> 17:33.302
-Excuse me?
-Come on, Ms. D.

17:33.761 --> 17:35.471
You're never in the lab
when Rosie is anymore.

17:35.554 --> 17:36.805
You're avoiding him.

17:36.889 --> 17:40.184
And my guess is the reason
starts with Ger and ends with Ald.

17:40.267 --> 17:42.102
-Am I right?
-Child, you are talking nonsense.

17:42.186 --> 17:44.313
I've been busy.
Have you seen Mitchie?

17:44.688 --> 17:47.524
Why? You wanna ask him something
you should be asking Rosie?

17:58.035 --> 17:59.036
Sorry.

18:00.037 --> 18:00.996
Did I scare you?

18:01.080 --> 18:03.123
No. No, of course not. I was just...

18:04.291 --> 18:05.667
singing along to gospel music.

18:05.751 --> 18:07.628
Mitchie, I need a favor.

18:09.004 --> 18:12.424
It's just with you Rosewoods
favors often give birth to secrets.

18:12.508 --> 18:15.135
The last time I did one of you a favor
it didn't go so well.

18:15.219 --> 18:16.804
This is gonna be very different.

18:16.887 --> 18:19.181
Okay, so Rosie knows about this favor?

18:19.264 --> 18:21.642
No, he doesn't,
and I'd like to keep it that way.

18:21.725 --> 18:25.938
This is a matter of life and death,
and you will not regret this.

18:28.148 --> 18:29.316
What can I do for you?

18:34.113 --> 18:36.990
Well, you called back.
That's amazing.

18:37.074 --> 18:38.659
Did you break my mass spectrometer?

18:38.742 --> 18:40.744
No, your equipment's fine.

18:41.495 --> 18:43.205
As am I, thank you for asking.

18:44.248 --> 18:45.249
Are you at a party?

18:45.332 --> 18:47.334
Where did you pull
the victim's blood sample from?

18:47.417 --> 18:49.336
Okay, no personal talk. Got it.

18:49.419 --> 18:52.214
From his arm, near where he was
injected and his femoral artery.

18:52.548 --> 18:55.592
Let me guess, you found morphine
in the sample from the arm,

18:55.676 --> 18:56.802
and not the other sample.

18:56.885 --> 18:59.179
Exactly, the other blood
only showed alcohol.

18:59.263 --> 19:02.057
Well, you didn't make a mistake, Tara.
The victim did not OD.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.810
Right, now, he was injected with
morphine, but he was already dead.

19:04.893 --> 19:06.478
No beating heart
means no blood circulation.

19:06.562 --> 19:08.772
Which means
nowhere for the drugs to go.

19:08.856 --> 19:12.484
Which is why no drugs showed up
in the other sample. Okay, got it.

19:13.026 --> 19:14.486
But we completed the autopsy

19:14.570 --> 19:16.572
and there's no sign
of any other cause of death.

19:17.197 --> 19:18.657
Then you guys have a problem

19:18.740 --> 19:21.827
'cause the blood doesn't lie,
and I'm never wrong, so, deuces.

19:25.080 --> 19:27.291
I know who I was married to.
He was a good man.

19:27.374 --> 19:30.335
Whoever this Connor Thorne guy is,
he's not Danny.

19:30.419 --> 19:31.712
-Okay Jenny maybe you just sit down.
-Don't.

19:31.795 --> 19:33.297
I'm not some child
that needs to be handled.

19:33.380 --> 19:35.591
No one is trying to handle you.

19:36.675 --> 19:37.926
Look at me, Jenny.

19:39.511 --> 19:42.514
Woman to woman, widow to widow,

19:42.598 --> 19:44.683
I promise you,
we're telling the truth.

19:46.143 --> 19:47.477
You lost your husband, too?

19:48.812 --> 19:53.275
Yes. And the hardest part can be
finding out they weren't perfect.

19:53.859 --> 19:55.402
Danny clearly had his reasons
for lying to you,

19:55.485 --> 19:57.571
but it doesn't mean
that he didn't love you.

19:58.405 --> 19:59.698
We need your help.

19:59.781 --> 20:03.535
Danny had a fight with this guy
at the stripclub hours before he died.

20:03.619 --> 20:05.370
We think it may be someone
from his past.

20:05.454 --> 20:08.582
-You recognize him?
-God, that's Troy.

20:09.291 --> 20:11.627
Troy Randolph.
He lives across the street.

20:16.173 --> 20:17.674
Damn, we just lost cause of death.

20:18.884 --> 20:21.261
-Villa.
-Yes. What?

20:22.054 --> 20:23.847
-Wanna talk about it?
-Talk about what?

20:24.181 --> 20:25.849
What's clearly on your mind, Eddie.

20:25.933 --> 20:27.726
Nothing to talk about. I'm fine.

20:28.435 --> 20:31.188
Yeah, okay, no, fine's right here
but up the block,

20:31.271 --> 20:32.856
around the corner,
down the next street,

20:32.940 --> 20:34.650
that's you. Whole other zip code.

20:36.318 --> 20:38.445
This is Whiskey X-Ray 448.

20:38.528 --> 20:40.155
I have an emergency priority message.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.282
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What're you doing?

20:42.366 --> 20:43.951
I think we need
something called probable cause

20:44.117 --> 20:45.577
before you go busting down
somebody's door.

20:45.661 --> 20:46.745
Listen.

20:47.204 --> 20:51.500
We'll have probable cause
in exactly three, two, one.

20:52.709 --> 20:54.253
Snap, I hear gunfire.

20:54.336 --> 20:56.213
You hear that, Rosie? We better go in.

20:57.798 --> 20:59.132
Miami PD.

20:59.216 --> 21:00.676
Whole other zip code.

21:00.759 --> 21:03.720
-Commando, one of my favorite movies.
-What the hell?

21:03.887 --> 21:06.848
You can't just break into somebody's
house. I don't care who you are.

21:07.057 --> 21:08.058
Look, I know my rights.

21:08.225 --> 21:10.602
I heard gunfire. I thought
you were in danger. My bad.

21:10.686 --> 21:12.062
Your bad?

21:12.145 --> 21:13.855
I am so gonna have your badge.

21:13.939 --> 21:15.023
Villa.

21:26.034 --> 21:27.786
I wasn't stalking Danny.

21:27.869 --> 21:30.455
I'm sorry. What do you call it
when you follow someone around

21:30.539 --> 21:32.582
and start taking
secret photos of them?

21:32.666 --> 21:35.377
Look, if we're going with the standard
definition of stalking,

21:35.460 --> 21:37.421
then yes, all right, maybe I was.

21:37.504 --> 21:39.172
But not for the reasons you think.

21:39.589 --> 21:40.799
Enlighten me.

21:41.883 --> 21:43.802
I'm really interested
in becoming a PI,

21:43.885 --> 21:47.139
so I needed to practice
taking covert photos and stuff.

21:47.556 --> 21:49.766
-I just--
-Don't you look at me.

21:50.100 --> 21:52.185
Do you know what happens
to weasels like you

21:52.269 --> 21:53.854
when they get thrown
in a cell for life

21:53.937 --> 21:56.356
next to someone called Big Scoops?

21:57.482 --> 22:00.694
You guys would bond,
braid each other's hair.

22:00.777 --> 22:02.070
I don't want to braid anything.

22:02.154 --> 22:04.114
Then try telling me the truth.

22:04.197 --> 22:05.574
Damn it, he didn't deserve her!

22:05.657 --> 22:08.160
He made her miserable,
and I mean like all the time.

22:08.243 --> 22:10.287
When he wasn't home,
I'd catch her at night crying

22:10.370 --> 22:12.039
and I hated seeing her like that.

22:12.914 --> 22:13.957
Jenny Williams.

22:16.376 --> 22:17.586
Wow.

22:18.337 --> 22:19.755
You're in love with Danny's wife.

22:20.255 --> 22:21.840
You killed him to be with Jenny.

22:21.923 --> 22:23.008
What? No, I...

22:23.425 --> 22:25.552
wanted Jenny to choose me over Danny.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.722
And she can't exactly do that
if he's dead, right?

22:28.805 --> 22:31.266
So what?
You were following Danny around,

22:31.350 --> 22:33.810
trying to gather up dirt
that would make Jenny leave him?

22:33.894 --> 22:36.688
Well, not just trying, I succeeded.

22:36.772 --> 22:39.358
Look, Danny was a liar,
he was a cheat.

22:39.441 --> 22:40.817
And I have the photos to prove it.

22:41.151 --> 22:44.363
He was having an affair
with some hot model-looking doctor.

22:44.821 --> 22:47.783
Now, if you ask me,
maybe Danny got tired of the affair,

22:47.866 --> 22:48.867
he tried to end it,

22:48.950 --> 22:51.161
hot doc, she wasn't having that,
so she killed him.

22:51.244 --> 22:55.665
Okay, Columbo, why don't you
just leave the police work to us?

22:57.292 --> 22:58.293
Sit tight.

23:10.597 --> 23:11.681
What? What's wrong?

23:12.724 --> 23:15.602
Well, your ex-almost-mother-in-law
asked me for a favor

23:15.685 --> 23:18.146
and I couldn't say no
'cause she's got this stare

23:18.230 --> 23:19.815
that just peers right into your soul,
you know,

23:19.898 --> 23:21.817
so you gotta say yes.
And now--

23:21.900 --> 23:23.402
-About Gerald?
-Yeah.

23:24.152 --> 23:26.446
Wait. What? You know about him?

23:26.530 --> 23:27.948
How do you know?
How are you so calm about it?

23:28.031 --> 23:29.324
Do you know why he's in prison?

23:29.408 --> 23:30.742
We have to tell Rosie about this.

23:30.826 --> 23:34.037
Okay, just breathe. And, you know,
it's not our place to judge.

23:34.204 --> 23:36.123
The Rosewoods are our family, okay?

23:36.206 --> 23:39.084
And we can't let them implode,
and that's exactly what's gonna happen

23:39.167 --> 23:41.044
as soon as Rosie and Pippy
find out about this.

23:41.128 --> 23:42.587
Any progress on the cause of death?

23:43.046 --> 23:45.215
No, you know what though,
when we find out, we're gonna tell you

23:45.298 --> 23:47.008
'cause we're family. Team MCL, right?

23:47.551 --> 23:49.553
There's no secrets in a family.
Not in this house.

23:49.636 --> 23:51.012
Not in this house!

23:51.680 --> 23:52.806
You all right, Mitchie?

23:55.100 --> 23:56.435
Never better. What's in the box?

23:56.518 --> 23:58.645
Everything that was in Danny's car
at the crime scene.

23:58.728 --> 24:00.730
We have to go over it all
with a fine-tooth comb

24:00.814 --> 24:03.483
and that includes going back
over Danny's body,

24:03.567 --> 24:05.402
No organ goes unturned.

24:05.735 --> 24:08.363
He didn't die magically.
We'll figure it out.

24:13.326 --> 24:14.202
Hey.

24:14.286 --> 24:17.622
So, Danny had a mistress
he met at Mara Soul's Café,

24:17.706 --> 24:20.041
7:45, every Tuesday night.

24:20.750 --> 24:21.960
I'll admit, I didn't see that coming.

24:22.294 --> 24:24.045
That's because you see
the best in people, Rosie,

24:24.129 --> 24:25.172
I see the truth.

24:26.089 --> 24:27.674
-Yeah, uncalled for.
-Super accurate.

24:28.091 --> 24:29.676
Anyway, I don't know who she is,

24:29.759 --> 24:32.095
but I have a pretty good idea
where to find her.

24:32.554 --> 24:34.055
She runs a narcotics
anonymous meeting

24:34.139 --> 24:35.849
across the street from the café.

24:35.932 --> 24:37.100
That's the hot doc up front.

24:37.184 --> 24:39.019
She's wearing the sobriety ring
in the photos.

24:39.102 --> 24:40.937
Know who'd know to kill
and not leave a trace?

24:41.021 --> 24:42.022
A doctor.

24:42.105 --> 24:44.065
-Okay, I'll talk to hot doc.
-No, she's mine.

24:44.566 --> 24:45.901
You get skater boy over there.

24:45.984 --> 24:49.070
He seems a little too on edge
and he keeps checking the door.

24:55.535 --> 24:58.955
Danny was right.
This is exactly where I needed to be.

24:59.331 --> 25:01.666
-You know Danny?
-Danny Williams, yeah.

25:02.167 --> 25:04.127
I'm actually surprised
he didn't show up tonight.

25:05.670 --> 25:08.006
-I'm Annalise.
-Emily.

25:08.882 --> 25:12.552
You know, he mentioned you.
He said incredible things about you.

25:12.636 --> 25:15.555
I mean, if I didn't know any better,
I'd say he had a crush.

25:15.639 --> 25:16.681
What?

25:17.265 --> 25:19.559
No, I mean, he's my sponsor,

25:19.643 --> 25:21.228
so, yeah, we're close,

25:21.311 --> 25:23.980
but there's definitely
nothing romantic between us.

25:25.273 --> 25:26.441
You sure about that?

25:26.942 --> 25:28.568
You're not a friend of Danny's.

25:30.111 --> 25:31.780
What are you? Private Investigator?

25:35.951 --> 25:37.369
Did something happen to Danny?

25:37.702 --> 25:39.371
You know, I'm not surprised
Danny sent you here.

25:39.454 --> 25:40.830
Blesses every life he touches.

25:41.164 --> 25:41.998
Amen, amen.

25:42.332 --> 25:44.042
Sounds like you're talking
from personal experience.

25:44.125 --> 25:44.960
Bro, you kidding?

25:45.043 --> 25:47.379
Danny's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

25:47.462 --> 25:49.714
Hooked me up with this
crazy scholarship after I got clean.

25:49.798 --> 25:51.049
-Sounds like my man.
-Yeah.

25:51.132 --> 25:53.802
You know, I bet everyone in here
has a personal Danny story.

25:55.053 --> 25:57.138
Yeah, he helped Joe and Meg
save their home.

25:57.889 --> 26:00.433
Seem like, I don't know,
forclosure or whatever.

26:00.850 --> 26:04.521
Listen, I don't mean to pry,
but you seem a little on edge.

26:05.146 --> 26:07.274
-Maybe I can help?
-No, man.

26:08.066 --> 26:10.986
It's just Danny never misses a meeting
so I'm getting a little worried.

26:14.781 --> 26:15.782
We're screwed.

26:15.865 --> 26:18.285
We have no cause of death,
and now no suspects either.

26:18.368 --> 26:19.369
What about the kiss?

26:19.786 --> 26:21.329
She mistook his kindness for a crush

26:21.413 --> 26:23.623
and planted a kiss on him
during their last meeting.

26:24.332 --> 26:26.501
She was worried that's the reason
he didn't show up tonight.

26:26.668 --> 26:29.546
Well, why don't we stop by
get some side bowls, regroup,

26:29.629 --> 26:31.214
look over Danny's file again.

26:31.298 --> 26:33.258
Thanks, but I think
I'm gonna call it a night.

26:33.717 --> 26:35.343
Hit it with fresh eyes in the morning.

26:52.986 --> 26:54.029
Come on, Eddie.

27:16.718 --> 27:20.138
Get it together, Annalise,
get it together.

27:43.912 --> 27:44.996
Hey. You okay?

27:46.414 --> 27:47.832
Come on, it's way past midnight.

27:47.916 --> 27:50.710
A little too late for a nightcap.
But okay.

27:51.044 --> 27:52.128
Let me get you a glass you--

27:52.504 --> 27:53.797
Okay, forget about the glass.

27:54.172 --> 27:55.882
What's going on?
What's with the suitcase?

27:56.257 --> 27:57.258
Go ahead, open it.

27:57.717 --> 27:59.636
Open it! It's a surprise.

28:00.095 --> 28:03.431
You get a surprise, I get a surprise,
we all get a surprise!

28:04.015 --> 28:06.810
Well, the headache you're gonna
have tomorrow will not be a surprise.

28:16.528 --> 28:19.322
-What are these photos?
-Don't know. Don't care.

28:19.948 --> 28:21.032
You know who hides money?

28:22.659 --> 28:23.660
Criminals.

28:23.743 --> 28:27.914
Surprise! My lying husband
was a criminal!

28:27.997 --> 28:29.290
Whoo!

28:30.125 --> 28:31.584
You're jumping to conclusions,
you know.

28:31.668 --> 28:35.338
You know what, Rosie, you're right.
I am, but I don't care anymore.

28:37.507 --> 28:41.553
I am done fantasizing about the man
Eddie clearly never was.

28:41.636 --> 28:45.056
I am done turning myself
inside out over him.

28:45.140 --> 28:47.934
I am done.
He can solve his own damn murder.

29:01.197 --> 29:04.159
-Well...
-Not so loud, Mama Rosewood.

29:04.242 --> 29:06.411
It is not what you think.

29:09.164 --> 29:10.623
I slept on the couch.

29:10.707 --> 29:13.710
Or maybe it was the floor.
I don't know, it's all a little fuzzy.

29:18.089 --> 29:20.341
Annalise, what is going on here?

29:20.925 --> 29:23.470
And please don't insult my intelligence
by telling me "nothing."

29:23.553 --> 29:24.846
'Cause I can see you're in pain,

29:24.929 --> 29:26.806
and I'm not just talking about
that hangover.

29:27.140 --> 29:28.141
Thank you.

29:30.602 --> 29:32.687
Eddie isn't who I thought he was.

29:33.897 --> 29:34.939
Your late husband?

29:35.273 --> 29:38.359
All evidence points to him being
involved in something criminal.

29:38.818 --> 29:40.069
Something he kept from me.

29:41.488 --> 29:43.072
And it's probably what got him killed.

29:43.615 --> 29:44.741
I'm so sorry.

29:45.825 --> 29:48.369
-I had no idea.
-Neither did I apparently.

29:51.456 --> 29:52.499
My dear,

29:54.375 --> 29:59.339
sometimes you have to
ignore what the evidence says

30:00.048 --> 30:01.174
and trust your gut.

30:02.050 --> 30:03.718
What you and Eddie had was special.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.428
He deserves the benefit of the doubt.

30:05.512 --> 30:09.432
Well, I can't just turn a blind eye
to the lies and all this money.

30:09.641 --> 30:12.018
Well you don't know where he got the
money, how he was gonna use it.

30:12.101 --> 30:13.853
Maybe it's not as bad as you think.

30:15.104 --> 30:16.105
The money.

30:17.315 --> 30:19.317
That's how Danny Williams
was helping his friends,

30:19.400 --> 30:20.485
with the money he stole.

30:21.194 --> 30:23.071
Okay, I have no idea
what you're talking about,

30:23.154 --> 30:24.906
but I will take your word for it.

30:24.989 --> 30:26.115
I have to go.

30:26.699 --> 30:28.576
Please tell Rosie
I'll catch up with him later.

30:39.921 --> 30:42.882
Not the woman I was expecting,
but a beautiful surprise nonetheless.

30:42.966 --> 30:43.842
Eddie was murdered,

30:43.925 --> 30:46.636
and since this is the first I'm
hearing of it, I've really gotta ask,

30:46.719 --> 30:48.346
why are you
dragging your feet in this?

30:48.429 --> 30:49.722
Why haven't you exhumed the body yet?

30:49.806 --> 30:51.933
I'm trying not to
overstep my boundaries again.

30:53.351 --> 30:55.228
I'll have the body exhumed
if she asks me to.

30:56.187 --> 30:57.355
-I'm following your lead on this one.
-Oh, please!

30:57.438 --> 30:59.065
We Rosewoods
never do anything halfway.

30:59.148 --> 31:00.400
That girl needs closure.

31:00.483 --> 31:03.820
She needs the full
Beaumont Rosewood Jr. on this.

31:03.903 --> 31:05.697
Did you come over here
to talk about Villa?

31:05.780 --> 31:09.659
No, but clearly,
you have a lot on your plate

31:09.742 --> 31:11.119
so it can wait.

31:11.578 --> 31:13.246
Well, what is "it" exactly?

31:13.329 --> 31:15.582
We can talk about it later, son.

31:19.711 --> 31:22.839
I'm working.
Unsuccessfully, but still working.

31:23.298 --> 31:24.215
Well, that would explain

31:24.299 --> 31:26.885
why you haven't called
your older, better looking sibling.

31:27.260 --> 31:29.929
You mean the big-headed,
moderately successful sibling?

31:30.346 --> 31:32.056
Hey, listen, have you
talked to Mom lately?

31:32.140 --> 31:33.933
-I think something's up with her.
-Like what?

31:34.017 --> 31:35.685
If I knew I wouldn't be calling you.

31:36.185 --> 31:38.438
Think it has something to do
with her new friend, Gerald.

31:39.480 --> 31:40.565
The boyfriend.

31:41.024 --> 31:42.358
Fine, I'll check in on her.

31:42.442 --> 31:43.443
Cool.

31:44.152 --> 31:46.154
Listen, I'd hate to think
moving on from TMI

31:46.237 --> 31:48.072
meant you'd moved on
from the rest of us too.

31:48.615 --> 31:49.699
Goodbye, Rosie.

31:54.329 --> 31:55.705
Danny had a hidden bank account?

31:55.872 --> 31:57.206
One his wife didn't know about.

31:57.498 --> 31:59.375
It's where he stashed
the two million dollars he stole,

31:59.459 --> 32:01.169
but he wasn't
using the money on himself.

32:01.252 --> 32:03.212
He used it to help his NA friends.

32:03.296 --> 32:04.339
Guess Rosie was right.

32:04.547 --> 32:06.215
Danny was trying
to make amends for his past.

32:06.299 --> 32:09.636
Know what, Good for him. All I care about
is how this helps me catch a murderer.

32:09.802 --> 32:11.012
There's a large transfer of funds

32:11.095 --> 32:12.889
out of the account
the day before Danny died.

32:13.097 --> 32:15.224
Is that another Robin Hood payout
to one of his friends?

32:15.683 --> 32:16.559
Guess again.

32:16.643 --> 32:18.603
The money went
to Troy Randolph's account.

32:20.772 --> 32:22.649
The neighbor was blackmailing Danny.

32:22.941 --> 32:25.109
So he must have figured out
Danny was really Connor Thorne.

32:25.193 --> 32:27.362
Something he forgot to mention
last time we talked.

32:28.488 --> 32:31.240
You know, maybe it's time I had
a different kind of talk with Troy.

32:36.496 --> 32:39.582
Wow. I see we're abandoning
the tenets of

32:39.666 --> 32:41.125
the Daisy Villa
School of Stress Relief.

32:41.209 --> 32:42.627
Well, I like my way better.

32:44.087 --> 32:46.005
Cap, let's take a walk.

32:46.089 --> 32:48.383
Now's not a good time.
And stop calling me that.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.259
The walk is non-negotiable.

32:57.850 --> 32:59.769
Now I'm not sure
I like this bossy side of you.

32:59.852 --> 33:02.188
Look, I know you don't wanna talk
about whatever got you demoted

33:02.271 --> 33:04.482
-or this weird thing with Slade--
-That's very perceptive of you.

33:04.565 --> 33:07.694
Okay, zip it. I'm not done, okay? You got
a whole department that looks up to you.

33:07.860 --> 33:10.321
Villa, 18 years ago, I showed up
at a suspect's house

33:10.405 --> 33:12.865
and beat him up pretty badly
for laying his hands on his kid.

33:13.533 --> 33:17.412
He lived at 2422 Oreo Lane,
and I showed up 2242.

33:18.287 --> 33:19.831
I beat up the wrong guy 'cause...

33:21.624 --> 33:23.001
I flipped the numbers.

33:23.626 --> 33:24.961
I do that sometimes.

33:25.044 --> 33:27.088
The Chief at the time
made the whole thing go away.

33:27.171 --> 33:28.381
I never asked how.

33:28.464 --> 33:29.966
Slade must know about my dyslexia,

33:30.049 --> 33:32.343
that's why he keeps benching me
with all this paperwork.

33:32.427 --> 33:34.512
Now my guess is
he hates that he can't fire me,

33:34.595 --> 33:36.180
so he's hoping that he can
make me quit.

33:36.264 --> 33:37.390
And I just might.

33:38.307 --> 33:40.226
Because going through
all those papers in there

33:40.560 --> 33:42.103
is literally torture.

33:42.186 --> 33:43.521
You're a hell of a cop.

33:44.564 --> 33:46.024
And a hell of a leader.

33:46.190 --> 33:51.112
Look, I don't care if it takes
one number and one letter at a time,

33:51.779 --> 33:52.780
you can do this.

33:53.906 --> 33:56.200
Okay? And no way
Slade wins on this one.

33:56.284 --> 33:57.368
Not on my watch...

33:58.619 --> 33:59.620
Captain.

34:03.833 --> 34:06.169
We are the best
pathology lab, period.

34:06.544 --> 34:10.339
'Cause we are Team Magic City. I have
no problem sharing the spotlight.

34:10.506 --> 34:13.092
So I'm guessing whatever's on that tray
is the answer to our problems?

34:13.176 --> 34:17.055
Well, I found a white powdery residue
on Danny's items in the evidence box.

34:17.138 --> 34:18.765
Same residue that was on his clothes.

34:18.848 --> 34:21.267
-Cocaine?
-No, not coke. Try keratin.

34:21.350 --> 34:23.853
Human nails keratin.
Danny's nails weren't manicured.

34:23.936 --> 34:25.438
The killer filed them down
before leaving.

34:25.521 --> 34:26.981
Danny must've scratched him
fighting for his life.

34:27.065 --> 34:29.609
So the killer didn't want anyone
to find the tissue or DNA.

34:29.692 --> 34:31.736
Yeah, well too bad he didn't think
to clean up the nail residue

34:31.819 --> 34:34.530
because in it I found
high density polyethylene

34:34.614 --> 34:35.990
and two sets of DNA.

34:36.074 --> 34:39.077
-Okay, Danny and who else?
-That's what I need you to find out.

34:39.494 --> 34:41.412
Well, where's the polyethylene from?

34:41.496 --> 34:43.122
I think I can answer that one.

34:44.248 --> 34:45.249
Welcome back.

34:45.333 --> 34:48.336
Don't get excited. Slow your roll.
I'm not staying.

34:48.419 --> 34:52.423
So, the polyethylene is from the bag
that your killer filled with nitrogen

34:52.882 --> 34:54.050
and placed over Danny's head.

34:55.009 --> 34:56.469
It's a suicide bag kit.

34:56.552 --> 34:58.930
The nitrogen replaces
the oxygen in the body,

34:59.013 --> 35:00.389
suffocating him from the inside.

35:00.473 --> 35:02.767
Leaving no trace... Ta-da!

35:03.142 --> 35:04.310
Silent killer.

35:04.685 --> 35:05.853
How'd you figure it out?

35:07.063 --> 35:08.272
Actually...

35:11.192 --> 35:12.193
you did.

35:12.777 --> 35:16.781
You said that the victim's
oxygen levels were inconsistent.

35:16.864 --> 35:19.992
Now, O2 levels
in arterial and venous blood

35:20.076 --> 35:23.204
they can differ significantly
when someone inhales inert gas.

35:23.412 --> 35:25.164
-Like nitrogen.
-Like nitrogen.

35:25.498 --> 35:27.875
Now, I didn't notice it
the first time I heard your message,

35:27.959 --> 35:29.252
but once I listened to it again,

35:29.335 --> 35:32.130
I realized it was the oxygen levels
that caught my attention.

35:32.588 --> 35:34.549
Wait, you listened to my message
more than once?

35:36.008 --> 35:38.219
On that note,
I've done what I came to do.

35:39.095 --> 35:40.471
-Pippy out.
-Here.

35:41.180 --> 35:42.932
Your job is here
whenever you want it back.

35:44.725 --> 35:45.726
Thanks, bro.

35:46.352 --> 35:48.187
All right, run that DNA
through the sequencer.

35:48.271 --> 35:49.355
Let's nail this bastard.

35:49.438 --> 35:50.439
Yeah, you got it.

35:52.066 --> 35:53.276
Where's the other detective?

35:54.277 --> 35:55.486
The pretty one.

35:55.653 --> 35:58.197
Troy, I am the pretty one.

35:59.740 --> 36:03.077
You can tell me. I mean, you knew
Danny was Connor Thorne, right?

36:03.828 --> 36:04.829
Yes.

36:05.288 --> 36:06.289
Okay?

36:06.706 --> 36:08.124
I blackmailed him. Once.

36:08.791 --> 36:10.168
But I didn't kill him.

36:11.002 --> 36:12.503
Then why didn't you tell us that?

36:13.254 --> 36:14.672
I was thinking about Big Scoops.

36:15.298 --> 36:17.508
Extortion is a felony offense
in Florida.

36:17.592 --> 36:20.261
I wasn't trying to spend
the next 15 years in prison.

36:20.344 --> 36:22.513
You know what carries
a longer sentence, gorgeous?

36:22.597 --> 36:23.806
Murder.

36:23.890 --> 36:24.932
What're you doing?

36:25.016 --> 36:27.059
Just giving you a little glimpse
into your future.

36:27.393 --> 36:29.729
Man, look at that mouth.

36:32.023 --> 36:34.567
Yeah, those prison boys
are gonna eat you up.

36:34.650 --> 36:36.360
Have you ever been
somebody's bitch before?

36:36.444 --> 36:39.739
Okay, I get it.
Just please stop touching me.

36:41.115 --> 36:43.159
I didn't say anything
about Danny being Connor

36:43.242 --> 36:45.620
because I didn't wanna
cause any problems for anyone.

36:46.287 --> 36:48.206
I just know that I didn't kill him.

36:49.457 --> 36:50.583
I swear.

36:51.918 --> 36:53.502
Oh, my God, but you know who did.

36:55.213 --> 36:56.964
-I know who killed Danny.
-And it wasn't Troy.

37:01.260 --> 37:04.096
Of course my DNA was all over Danny.
He was my husband.

37:04.180 --> 37:05.556
Roll up your sleeves.

37:10.228 --> 37:13.022
Bitch, don't make me climb over
this table and do it for you.

37:19.987 --> 37:22.031
Let me tell you a story.
You like stories?

37:22.448 --> 37:24.617
It's about a woman.

37:24.700 --> 37:26.285
Let's call her Penny.

37:26.369 --> 37:27.870
She moves to Miami,

37:28.371 --> 37:31.832
marries what she thought was
the perfect husband,

37:32.166 --> 37:35.002
they live in their perfect
little suburban house,

37:35.086 --> 37:38.381
probably planning to get a dog,
eventually throw in a kid or two,

37:38.464 --> 37:41.425
and then, a nosy lovesick neighbor
comes over

37:41.509 --> 37:44.345
and tells her that her perfect life
is all a lie.

37:44.428 --> 37:47.473
He even has proof that Penny's husband
is a wanted criminal

37:47.556 --> 37:49.850
and tried to pay the neighbor off
to keep him quiet.

37:49.934 --> 37:53.479
Realizing her whole marriage
is a sham, Penny flips her lid

37:54.188 --> 37:55.940
and kills her husband.

37:58.818 --> 38:00.444
Don't you love that story?

38:00.528 --> 38:02.488
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

38:02.571 --> 38:05.533
I get it. I get the impulse
to kill him for lying.

38:05.616 --> 38:07.535
I really get it.

38:08.119 --> 38:09.120
I know why she did it.

38:09.537 --> 38:11.664
Yeah, thanks, but I think
we got it figured out.

38:11.747 --> 38:12.748
No, you haven't.

38:12.832 --> 38:14.667
...to the cops.
Why kill him?

38:14.750 --> 38:17.086
Because killing Connor Thorne
was her plan all along.

38:17.878 --> 38:20.673
Jenny's stepfather is Walter McCall.

38:20.756 --> 38:23.384
He committed suicide
after Connor lost all his money.

38:26.345 --> 38:29.598
You tracked Connor down to Miami
to make him pay for what happened.

38:30.725 --> 38:33.269
Connor got what he deserved.

38:33.602 --> 38:36.939
I lost the only father
I had ever known because of him.

38:37.023 --> 38:38.941
And I would feel sorry for you

38:39.025 --> 38:40.985
if it was just about
avenging your father,

38:41.068 --> 38:42.987
but you showed your true colors.

38:43.070 --> 38:46.115
Somewhere along the way it became
more about greed for you.

38:46.198 --> 38:48.492
That's why you didn't kill him
when you first found him.

38:48.576 --> 38:50.077
You had to find the money first.

38:50.161 --> 38:52.246
Money you felt entitled to.

38:52.872 --> 38:54.749
Troy had the missing piece
of the puzzle,

38:54.832 --> 38:56.500
proof that Danny still had the money.

38:57.626 --> 39:00.379
Hey, look at that.
That's team work right there.

39:00.629 --> 39:01.797
You know what they say, right?

39:01.881 --> 39:03.549
Please don't say
it makes the dream work.

39:03.632 --> 39:05.885
Makes it work!
Yeah, makes it work.

39:06.719 --> 39:09.847
You know, you can't fool me, Slade.
You're proud of your team.

39:10.431 --> 39:11.849
And that includes Hornstock.

39:19.815 --> 39:21.108
Favor granted.

39:22.485 --> 39:23.569
Thank you.

39:26.364 --> 39:28.074
One of you, speak, now.

39:28.157 --> 39:31.327
Well, TMI and I feel that...
We, together, feel that maybe--

39:31.410 --> 39:33.704
You have to tell Pippy and Rosie. about
Gerald They deserve to know.

39:33.788 --> 39:35.706
-What she said.
-Trust your children, Ms. D.

39:35.790 --> 39:37.166
You know their reaction might surprise
you.

39:37.249 --> 39:39.001
And at the end of the day, they're family.

39:39.085 --> 39:40.628
Ohana. Ohana means family,

39:40.711 --> 39:42.838
and family means never get left behind
or forgotten.

39:42.922 --> 39:44.507
Did you just quote Lilo and Stitch?

39:45.257 --> 39:46.717
Thank you, both, for your concern.

39:46.801 --> 39:48.636
And I will take it into consideration.

39:48.719 --> 39:50.221
That's not good enough.

39:50.304 --> 39:52.973
Either you tell Rosie, or I will.

39:57.061 --> 39:57.937
Tell me what?

39:58.020 --> 40:00.356
Okay, that's our cue.
We're just gonna go somewhere else.

40:07.738 --> 40:08.906
What's going on?

40:11.158 --> 40:12.410
It's about Gerald.

40:21.710 --> 40:22.962
Nice digs!

40:24.964 --> 40:26.465
Hey. Yeah.

40:27.091 --> 40:29.427
I'm not one for planting roots.
This is mobile.

40:31.011 --> 40:32.638
Am I in the doghouse or something?

40:32.847 --> 40:34.014
What would make you say that?

40:34.432 --> 40:35.391
Well, the look on your face,

40:35.474 --> 40:37.393
and the fact that you
tracked me down here.

40:40.104 --> 40:42.440
-You want a beer?
-You know, what you're doing to Hornstock,

40:42.731 --> 40:46.068
goes beyond being a dick
and move into full ass hat territory.

40:46.152 --> 40:47.736
I mean you can tell me how you
really feel.

40:47.820 --> 40:50.322
Using his disability
to make him quit--

40:50.406 --> 40:52.575
Wait. What're you talking about?
What disability?

40:52.658 --> 40:53.951
His dyslexia.

40:58.038 --> 40:59.748
Well, I didn't know, I swear it.

41:02.334 --> 41:05.045
Then what the hell
is going on with you two?

41:05.463 --> 41:06.797
Don't tell me "nothing".

41:07.506 --> 41:09.467
Look, he messed up,
he beat up a suspect,

41:09.550 --> 41:12.011
-he broke the rules--
-Is that what you think this is about?

41:12.094 --> 41:14.263
Hornstock thought the guy hurt a kid.
Okay, I get that.

41:14.346 --> 41:16.140
Hell, I probably would've
kicked his ass too.

41:16.223 --> 41:17.349
What I have a problem with

41:17.433 --> 41:20.352
is Hornstock slapping his ass
over to IA 18 years later

41:20.436 --> 41:22.730
and turning himself in.
I mean, that is a punk move.

41:22.813 --> 41:24.648
What am I supposed to do
with a guy like that?

41:24.732 --> 41:26.275
I need guys on my team
that I can trust

41:26.358 --> 41:28.694
to do whatever it takes
to get the bad guys off the street,

41:28.777 --> 41:31.489
not guys who are gonna go running
to IA over every little thing.

41:32.156 --> 41:34.408
And I would love the Hornstock
from 18 years ago.

41:35.117 --> 41:36.952
But I don't think that guy exists anymore.

41:37.661 --> 41:41.040
This Hornstock is exactly the guy
you need on your team, trust me.

41:42.541 --> 41:43.959
You just have to give him a chance.

41:46.420 --> 41:47.671
Enjoy your beer.

41:59.391 --> 42:00.768
Hey, Villa. Everything okay?

42:00.851 --> 42:02.228
Eddie was my husband.

42:02.686 --> 42:04.230
Our love was real, I know that.

42:05.105 --> 42:06.315
I need to trust that.

42:07.316 --> 42:08.359
Trust him.

42:10.277 --> 42:11.570
I'm really ready to do this.

42:12.613 --> 42:13.864
I need to face this thing head on

42:13.948 --> 42:16.116
and get to the bottom of
what happened to Eddie.

42:16.200 --> 42:17.451
Glad to hear you say that.

42:18.202 --> 42:20.663
I just put in a request
to have Eddie's body exhumed.

42:25.918 --> 42:27.127
You're a good friend, Rosie.

42:28.045 --> 42:29.338
Good night.

42:45.896 --> 42:48.607
I figured it was just a matter of time

42:48.691 --> 42:51.527
before we were sitting
across from each other.

42:54.071 --> 42:55.531
I appreciate your coming by.

42:58.117 --> 42:59.660
Explain to me how...

43:01.370 --> 43:02.580
a serial killer,

43:04.248 --> 43:07.084
who gruesomely murdered
two young innocent women,

43:08.752 --> 43:11.880
befriends my mother and convinces her
to put it all on the line for him.

43:16.218 --> 43:17.303
I'm listening.
