01:20.601 --> 01:22.400
Mom, you're cooking!

01:22.435 --> 01:24.567
Well,
it's not every year

01:24.602 --> 01:27.434
Kelly gets promoted
to the next grade.

01:29.067 --> 01:32.267
You know, Kel, for a while there
I was catching up with you.

01:32.302 --> 01:33.501
Another couple of years

01:33.536 --> 01:36.434
and we'd have been
in the same grade.

01:36.469 --> 01:40.133
You could have gone out
with my friend Moosie.

01:40.168 --> 01:41.501
Oh, I couldn't.

01:41.536 --> 01:44.367
Word around school
is that you're dating him.

01:45.534 --> 01:48.033
Come on now, kids.
We're Bundys.

01:48.068 --> 01:50.901
How often do we
get to be happy?

01:52.400 --> 01:54.400
Kelly, I'm so proud of you.

01:54.435 --> 01:57.434
I remember your
first day of school,

01:57.469 --> 01:58.934
How we both cried.

01:58.969 --> 02:00.434
And then you discovered boys,

02:00.469 --> 02:02.434
and I discovered
daytime television.

02:02.469 --> 02:03.634
You know one of these days

02:03.669 --> 02:05.434
you're gonna marry one
of those boys,

02:05.469 --> 02:07.801
and then you'll discover
daytime television.

02:09.300 --> 02:12.434
Is it okay if
I have a life first, Mom?

02:12.469 --> 02:14.801
Sure, give it a try.

02:16.734 --> 02:18.067
Hi, honey.

02:18.102 --> 02:21.300
Peg, I heard some bad news
on the radio driving home.

02:21.335 --> 02:24.167
If you don't use it,
you lose it?

02:27.434 --> 02:30.534
What do I care?
You already got it.

02:30.569 --> 02:33.968
Hey, you know Gary,
the guy who owns the shoe store,

02:34.003 --> 02:35.467
well, he was in a plane

02:35.502 --> 02:39.033
that crashed into the ocean
off the coast of Hawaii.

02:39.068 --> 02:41.901
Gee, everybody gets
to go to Hawaii but us.

02:43.033 --> 02:46.000
Peg, for a change,
you don't understand.

02:46.035 --> 02:48.100
A human life has
just been snuffed out.

02:48.135 --> 02:49.534
Who's going to sign
my paycheck?

02:49.569 --> 02:51.033
What's to sign?

02:51.068 --> 02:53.901
They just hand you
a roll of nickels.

02:55.400 --> 02:58.234
Well, it isn't anything compared
to what you bring home,

02:58.269 --> 03:02.200
like the swine flu you brought
back from your family reunion.

03:02.235 --> 03:05.567
Look, I could end up
unemployed here.

03:05.602 --> 03:07.300
Now, how am I gonna
pay my bills?

03:07.335 --> 03:08.801
Well, if Kelly
ever graduates,

03:08.836 --> 03:10.701
we're gonna have
a heck of a lawsuit

03:10.736 --> 03:13.667
against the board
of education.

03:15.100 --> 03:18.467
We can't count on that, Bud.

03:18.502 --> 03:21.634
You know, they already
call us the Poor Bundys.

03:21.669 --> 03:24.200
I mean, what will they call us
when we have no money?

03:24.235 --> 03:28.634
Those darn poachers?

03:28.669 --> 03:32.467
Eh, what am I worried about?
They're not gonna fire me.

03:32.502 --> 03:35.801
I got experience, I got...

03:35.836 --> 03:38.300
They're not gonna fire me.

03:38.335 --> 03:41.334
You know what really bothers me
about this death thing?

03:41.369 --> 03:44.767
Here's a guy lying dead
at the bottom of the ocean.

03:44.802 --> 03:47.868
And he never even took
the time to meet me.

03:47.903 --> 03:52.334
Well, I bet he's sorry now, Al.

03:52.369 --> 03:54.234
Yeah, you bet.

03:54.269 --> 03:56.033
You know, I worked
for this guy for years

03:56.068 --> 03:58.000
and he never even knew
that I was alive.

03:58.035 --> 03:59.601
You know, I never thought
of this before,

03:59.636 --> 04:01.934
but I deserve
some recognition.

04:01.969 --> 04:04.801
Everybody deserves a pat
on the back every now and then.

04:04.836 --> 04:06.934
Yeah,
what about me, Al?

04:06.969 --> 04:10.934
I'm sorry, honey. I was talking
about people who work.

04:10.969 --> 04:14.868
Now there will be new owners
that will ignore me.

04:14.903 --> 04:19.200
Well, you know, after the family
stops bereaving and all.

04:19.235 --> 04:20.601
You know, Al,
maybe we should send

04:20.636 --> 04:22.834
something special
to the family.

04:22.869 --> 04:25.567
Yeah? How about scuba gear
and a body bag?

04:30.000 --> 04:31.334
No, you're right, Peg.

04:31.369 --> 04:34.267
We ought to get something
big and expensive.

04:34.302 --> 04:37.267
I don't think they'd
appreciate your father,

04:37.302 --> 04:40.133
so, uh...we'll have
to do with flowers.

04:40.168 --> 04:42.133
Al, you never even met Gary.

04:42.168 --> 04:43.634
That's the whole point.

04:43.669 --> 04:45.667
When they see
my present,

04:45.702 --> 04:47.267
they'll
remember Al Bundy.

04:47.302 --> 04:48.767
Well, if you wanted that,

04:48.802 --> 04:51.968
why don't you just
send them your socks?

04:52.003 --> 04:56.234
Mom, how do we know
this tuna isn't dad's boss?

04:56.269 --> 04:58.467
Because we bought it
last year.

05:00.701 --> 05:02.434
I'm gonna call
the florist right now.

05:02.469 --> 05:06.434
You know, Al, all this talk
about death makes you think.

05:06.469 --> 05:09.434
I mean, one minute
the breadwinner is still alive,

05:09.469 --> 05:10.934
and then the next...

05:10.969 --> 05:13.734
You have insurance,
don't you, Al?

05:15.467 --> 05:18.501
Kelly, the guys
in here are naked.

05:18.536 --> 05:22.501
If I ever see anything like this
in your room again,

05:22.536 --> 05:24.501
you can just
kiss it goodbye.

05:24.536 --> 05:25.534
Hello!

05:29.167 --> 05:31.667
Well, they sent
the flowers out.

05:31.702 --> 05:33.667
I sent
so many flowers,

05:33.702 --> 05:35.167
they'll forget
about Gary.

05:35.202 --> 05:38.167
Did you ever think
about sending me flowers, Al?

05:38.202 --> 05:41.667
Why would I do that?
You're still alive.

05:41.702 --> 05:44.300
Well, they should've been
delivered by now.

05:44.335 --> 05:45.801
Stay off the phone.

05:45.836 --> 05:47.701
The family will probably
be calling any minute.

05:47.736 --> 05:49.534
For 300 bucks,
they better.

05:49.569 --> 05:53.801
$300? Al, where
did you get $300?

05:53.836 --> 05:55.300
Our vacation money.

05:55.335 --> 05:59.000
Oh, Al, I was planning
on spending that on clothes.

05:59.035 --> 06:00.501
It's all right.

06:00.536 --> 06:02.267
Our future begins
with Gary's death.

06:03.701 --> 06:05.200
Come on, phone, ring.

06:05.235 --> 06:07.701
Tell me
you got the flowers.

06:07.736 --> 06:09.701
"What a guy! We're gonna
give you a raise."

06:09.736 --> 06:11.067
Come on, ring.

06:12.269 --> 06:13.267
Hello.

06:14.968 --> 06:16.400
Al, it's
the door.

06:16.435 --> 06:18.901
Get it.
I'm on the phone.

06:18.936 --> 06:19.934
Hello.

06:23.300 --> 06:24.334
Hi.
Hi.

06:24.369 --> 06:26.334
Hey, Al, did you
hear about Gary?

06:26.369 --> 06:29.167
Yeah, he's dead.
Great tragedy, and all that.

06:29.202 --> 06:30.567
Stay off my phone.

06:31.769 --> 06:33.400
Hello.

06:33.435 --> 06:35.567
That's the oven
timer, Al.

06:35.602 --> 06:36.834
You cooked?

06:36.869 --> 06:39.701
No, it's just
a reminder to order dinner.

06:41.334 --> 06:42.834
Don't use my phone.

06:42.869 --> 06:44.334
Gary's widow
is gonna call.

06:44.369 --> 06:45.834
No, she's not, Al.

06:45.869 --> 06:47.334
Gary's not dead.

06:47.369 --> 06:49.267
We just heard it
on the news.

06:49.302 --> 06:50.601
He's alive?
Are you sure?

06:52.834 --> 06:55.834
Your boss
is quite a guy, Al.

06:55.869 --> 06:57.334
A self-made millionaire.

06:57.369 --> 06:59.868
He was flying
his own jet,

06:59.903 --> 07:02.367
had an equipment failure,
bailed out,

07:02.402 --> 07:05.534
and washed ashore
at a topless hula school.

07:05.569 --> 07:09.033
They made him a litter
from their grass skirts

07:09.068 --> 07:11.033
and nursed him to health.

07:11.068 --> 07:13.033
They think he's a god.

07:13.068 --> 07:14.400
So do I.

07:15.834 --> 07:17.234
Aw, gee, isn't
that great news, Al?

07:17.269 --> 07:20.100
You just spent $300
on flowers for a millionaire

07:20.135 --> 07:21.968
so that your family
could starve

07:22.003 --> 07:24.467
and your wife
could go naked.

07:24.502 --> 07:25.901
Believe me, Peg,

07:25.936 --> 07:28.901
I'd kill before
I let you go naked.

07:28.936 --> 07:31.901
And no jury would
convict me, either.

07:31.936 --> 07:36.434
All right, all right, so this
guy's still alive. Fine, good.

07:36.469 --> 07:38.234
So, when he gets home,
he'll see the flowers,

07:38.269 --> 07:40.200
see how much I care,

07:40.235 --> 07:41.400
and I'll still
get my raise.

07:41.435 --> 07:43.434
This'll be the best 300 bucks
I ever spent.

07:43.469 --> 07:45.434
I don't think he's going
to see your flowers, Al.

07:45.469 --> 07:47.734
They said the family sent
all the flowers

07:47.769 --> 07:49.133
out to his favorite
charities.

07:49.168 --> 07:51.133
Oh, well, gee,
I hope they send some

07:51.168 --> 07:53.634
to the poor
and stupid home,

07:53.669 --> 07:55.634
'cause that's where
we'll be in a few years.

07:55.669 --> 07:59.000
I told you we're not going
to live with your mother.

08:02.501 --> 08:05.567
Well, Al, at least you have
a boss who is still alive.

08:05.602 --> 08:08.067
Stand back.
It's Mardi gras time.

08:08.102 --> 08:11.567
I got the same stinking
job I always had,

08:11.602 --> 08:13.467
but I'm out 300 bucks.

08:13.502 --> 08:14.667
The only thing
I ever wanted

08:14.702 --> 08:16.300
out of this death
was a little recognition.

08:16.335 --> 08:19.467
Now, not only
is Gary not dead,

08:19.502 --> 08:21.200
he still doesn't
know I'm alive.

08:21.235 --> 08:23.734
But you know, honey,
sometimes at night,

08:23.769 --> 08:25.067
I'm not sure, either...

08:26.968 --> 08:28.334
But then you burp.

08:29.968 --> 08:31.968
You know, Peg, why
don't we just get you

08:32.003 --> 08:34.967
a pointed hat
with a bell on top?

08:35.003 --> 08:37.967
Then you could
squirt me with seltzer.

08:38.003 --> 08:39.900
Doesn't anybody understand
what I'm talking about?

08:39.936 --> 08:42.701
I work for a guy who wouldn't
spit on me if he saw me.

08:42.736 --> 08:44.167
Aw, come on, Al.

08:44.202 --> 08:45.367
Don't be so hard
on yourself.

08:45.402 --> 08:47.801
I'm sure he'd spit
on you if he saw you.

08:47.836 --> 08:50.033
Yeah, I'm sure you're out there
shooting hoops

08:50.068 --> 08:51.234
with Mr. Savings and Loan.

08:51.269 --> 08:53.501
Look, I don't know
the guy who owns the bank.

08:53.536 --> 08:55.133
Who knows his boss today?
Who cares?

08:55.168 --> 08:56.634
Well, I do.

08:56.669 --> 08:58.634
I'm going
to meet my boss.

08:58.669 --> 09:00.133
He owes me that.

09:00.168 --> 09:01.634
I'm tracking him down.

09:01.669 --> 09:04.133
I'm going
to give Gary 30 days

09:04.168 --> 09:07.133
to meet me face to face
in Chicago.

09:07.168 --> 09:09.133
He's going to shake my hand,
he's going to say,

09:09.168 --> 09:11.167
"Thank you, Al Bundy.
Nice job."

09:11.202 --> 09:12.667
What if he doesn't?

09:12.702 --> 09:14.534
Then I'm going to quit.

09:24.102 --> 09:27.501
Mom, what are
you humming about?

09:27.536 --> 09:31.000
This is the day Dad said
he's going to quit.

09:31.035 --> 09:32.467
So young, so young.

09:33.667 --> 09:36.167
Your father's
not going to quit.

09:36.202 --> 09:38.767
From the time he gets home
to the time he goes to sleep,

09:38.802 --> 09:40.367
he hasn't talked
about anything else.

09:40.402 --> 09:42.167
Yes, but have you notice,
in the last week,

09:42.202 --> 09:43.868
he hasn't mentioned it at all?

09:43.903 --> 09:47.434
That's just your father's
way of saying, "Oops!"

09:47.469 --> 09:48.834
Don't worry, honey.

09:48.869 --> 09:50.467
Your father's
not going to quit.

09:50.502 --> 09:53.234
I don't know.
He's a proud man, Mom.

09:53.269 --> 09:54.567
Of what, dear?

09:56.234 --> 09:57.801
I don't know,

09:57.836 --> 09:59.734
but in case
you're wrong,

09:59.769 --> 10:02.734
I figured out a couple
of ways for us to cut back.

10:02.769 --> 10:05.234
Oddly enough, they
all involve Kelly.

10:05.269 --> 10:08.234
I say we make
a clean break right now

10:08.269 --> 10:10.834
before we become
attached to her.

10:12.968 --> 10:14.434
Bud, she's my daughter.

10:14.469 --> 10:18.067
She's my sister and I'm willing
to give her up.

10:18.102 --> 10:23.701
All right. Who put
this ad in the paper?

10:25.000 --> 10:27.968
"Cheap blond,
16, looks 30...

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
"seeks job out of state,

10:32.035 --> 10:35.133
No reading
or writing, please."

10:37.667 --> 10:40.033
Now listen, the day
that I have to get a job,

10:40.068 --> 10:42.033
is the day that I walk
out of this house.

10:42.068 --> 10:44.734
I feel the same way.

10:44.769 --> 10:46.734
Dad's not really
going to quit is he?

10:46.769 --> 10:49.234
I mean, it's like
you always tell me-

10:49.269 --> 10:52.601
"If a man doesn't work,
he's no use at all."

10:52.636 --> 10:55.601
Don't you think
your father knows that?

10:55.636 --> 10:58.601
Just don't say anything
to anyone about Gary,

10:58.636 --> 11:00.601
and I'm sure this
whole thing will blow over.

11:00.636 --> 11:03.100
As long as no one knows,

11:03.135 --> 11:04.934
your father
will never quit.

11:04.969 --> 11:08.801
Five, four, three, two, one!

11:08.836 --> 11:10.868
Goodbye, Al!

11:14.133 --> 11:17.634
So long, shoe man.

11:17.669 --> 11:19.634
You guys
are pretty jolly.

11:19.669 --> 11:22.734
Don't you understand
I'm doing this for us,

11:22.769 --> 11:24.100
the little guys...

11:25.334 --> 11:26.701
And one large woman.

11:28.167 --> 11:31.167
If I can meet my boss,
maybe you can meet yours.

11:31.202 --> 11:34.067
I don't want
to meet my boss, Al.

11:34.102 --> 11:35.033
I steal.

11:36.300 --> 11:39.300
Hey, we came
to see you leave.

11:39.335 --> 11:41.634
Don't let us down.

11:41.669 --> 11:43.234
I'm going.
I'm going.

11:43.269 --> 11:44.634
Wait a second.

11:46.934 --> 11:50.434
Have you seen any sign of a rich
guy in the parking lot?

11:50.469 --> 11:53.434
A helicopter, a plane,
a guy in a suit, anything?

11:53.469 --> 11:54.934
Let me check.

11:54.969 --> 11:58.467
Hey, Ed, do you see
the rich guy coming?

11:58.502 --> 12:00.634
<i>I can't quite hear you.</i>

12:00.669 --> 12:02.968
<i>Some guy in a ski mask</i>

12:03.003 --> 12:06.834
<i>just set off his car
alarm trying to get in.</i>

12:08.868 --> 12:12.467
<i>Hey, mister, no need
to break that window.</i>

12:12.502 --> 12:15.334
<i>I got a coat hanger
you can use.</i>

12:16.834 --> 12:18.334
Look, I got
another appointment.

12:18.369 --> 12:19.701
So if you're not gonna leave,

12:19.736 --> 12:23.067
at least impale yourself
on your shoehorn.

12:23.102 --> 12:26.133
I said I was going,
and I'm going,

12:26.168 --> 12:28.634
but let me
tell you something.

12:28.669 --> 12:30.634
I'm not going
to just disappear.

12:30.669 --> 12:32.167
You'll see me again.

12:32.202 --> 12:35.167
Wherever a fat woman
shoves a smelly foot

12:35.202 --> 12:38.033
in front of some
poor guy's face...

12:39.501 --> 12:41.000
I'll be there.

12:41.035 --> 12:43.501
Whenever someone
comes into the store

12:43.536 --> 12:45.934
and tries to exchange
a pair of shoes

12:45.969 --> 12:47.934
he's been wearing
for three months,

12:47.969 --> 12:49.434
I'll be there.

12:49.469 --> 12:50.934
Whenever
kids come in,

12:50.969 --> 12:52.934
take off
their old shoes,

12:52.969 --> 12:55.734
and try to sneak out
with new ones,

12:55.769 --> 12:57.100
I'll be there too.

12:58.934 --> 13:00.100
Madam...

13:00.135 --> 13:02.601
When Shamu needs a mate,

13:02.636 --> 13:04.033
you'll be there.

13:26.467 --> 13:29.467
Gee, Al, it's almost
3:00 in the afternoon.

13:29.502 --> 13:32.467
You think you might
want to get dressed?

13:32.502 --> 13:33.734
What for?

13:33.769 --> 13:36.300
Aesthetics, and so
you'll look more dignified

13:36.335 --> 13:39.567
when you go beg
for your job back.

13:39.602 --> 13:42.467
I can't do that. You know what
would happen if I went back?

13:42.502 --> 13:45.133
Yeah, I could go back
to enjoying my days.

13:45.168 --> 13:48.400
What do you think I like
being here with you?

13:48.435 --> 13:50.901
It's not like I haven't
checked out the want ads.

13:50.936 --> 13:52.167
Look at this.

13:52.202 --> 13:56.133
All these jobs want a college
degree or computer skills,

13:56.168 --> 13:58.167
or worse- references.

13:58.202 --> 13:59.367
What am I supposed to do?

13:59.402 --> 14:01.534
Stoop as low as this
cheap blond

14:01.569 --> 14:03.300
who can't read or write?

14:08.567 --> 14:10.033
I don't know.

14:10.068 --> 14:13.033
Maybe I should have gone
into my father's line of work.

14:13.068 --> 14:16.367
Al, they have automatic
pinsetters now.

14:19.501 --> 14:22.000
Ah, it's probably
just as well.

14:22.035 --> 14:25.501
I remember many's a night
he'd wake up in a cold sweat

14:25.536 --> 14:26.801
yelling, "Wait! Wait!"

14:30.167 --> 14:33.133
Hey, kids, your father
just moved.

14:34.801 --> 14:35.868
What are you doing?

14:35.903 --> 14:37.267
I'm gonna watch the ballgame.

14:37.302 --> 14:40.267
<i>Excuse me. Spell That Word
is coming on.</i>

14:40.302 --> 14:42.667
And Al, during the day,

14:42.702 --> 14:45.234
this remote control
is mine.

14:45.269 --> 14:48.968
<i>And now, for the His
and Her Car Wax-</i>

14:49.003 --> 14:51.901
<i>Uh-oh, this
is a long one-</i>

14:51.936 --> 14:55.000
<i>Spell newspaper.</i>

15:04.267 --> 15:06.667
<i>Take me, Trevor,
take me.</i>

15:06.702 --> 15:08.467
<i>Take me.</i>

15:08.502 --> 15:09.501
<i>Where?</i>

15:10.901 --> 15:12.067
Who's that?

15:12.102 --> 15:14.534
That's Jade, the one
with the haunted past.

15:14.569 --> 15:16.467
I thought Iris has
the haunted past.

15:16.502 --> 15:19.000
That's another show.

15:19.035 --> 15:21.667
<i>Ooh, this really
is better, Jane.</i>

15:21.702 --> 15:22.834
Who's that?

15:22.869 --> 15:24.834
All, that's the lady
who sells soap.

15:24.869 --> 15:26.000
It's a commercial.

15:26.035 --> 15:28.000
I can't stand this anymore.

15:28.035 --> 15:30.000
You've been home for one day.

15:30.035 --> 15:31.501
And you are
driving me crazy.

15:31.536 --> 15:34.000
What did I do?
How am I driving you crazy?

15:34.035 --> 15:35.000
Who's that?

15:35.035 --> 15:36.501
Oh...

15:36.536 --> 15:38.501
Go back to work!

15:38.536 --> 15:41.033
Who's that?

15:45.501 --> 15:47.000
Hello.
Hi.

15:47.035 --> 15:48.934
We brought you
some leftovers.

15:48.969 --> 15:52.334
Vegetarian fajitas
and tofu croquettes.

15:53.901 --> 15:55.300
Now don't get
the wrong idea, Al.

15:55.335 --> 15:56.367
We are
not doing this

15:56.402 --> 15:57.734
because you're
out of work.

15:57.769 --> 15:59.968
It's just a coincidence,
we happened to make too much.

16:00.003 --> 16:02.467
You'd really be
doing us a favor

16:02.502 --> 16:04.467
taking it off
our hands.

16:04.502 --> 16:06.968
Ah, who are we kidding?
It's charity.

16:07.003 --> 16:08.534
So, how you doing buddy,

16:08.569 --> 16:10.467
enjoying your first day
out of work?

16:10.502 --> 16:12.968
Ooh, nice pajamas.

16:13.003 --> 16:16.567
Unemployment's really agreeing
with you, big guy.

16:16.602 --> 16:18.968
Well, it all comes down
to priorities.

16:19.003 --> 16:21.567
What's more important,
pride or money?

16:21.602 --> 16:22.667
Money, Al.

16:22.702 --> 16:23.968
I love it.

16:24.003 --> 16:26.334
I love
to look at it,

16:26.369 --> 16:28.667
be around it,
and count it.

16:28.702 --> 16:30.501
That's why I went
into the bank biz.

16:30.536 --> 16:33.501
But that's me,
and you're out of work.

16:33.536 --> 16:35.334
But hang in there,
there's plenty of work

16:35.369 --> 16:37.834
for a man with
your qualifications.

16:37.869 --> 16:42.000
Did you ever try
to shoe a horse, Al?

16:42.035 --> 16:46.000
You know, you are tall enough
to be Goofy at Disney World.

16:46.035 --> 16:47.501
Of course, you'd
have to relocate,

16:47.536 --> 16:51.133
But they have real nice
trailer parks there.

16:51.168 --> 16:53.467
You're enjoying
yourself, aren't you, Steve?

16:53.502 --> 16:56.501
Remember what you
did to my dog, Al?

16:56.536 --> 16:58.033
Yes, I do.

16:58.068 --> 16:59.534
To continue, then.

16:59.569 --> 17:02.033
You could get yourself
some flowers and sell them

17:02.068 --> 17:03.534
at the expressway
off-ramp.

17:03.569 --> 17:05.032
Now, Steve.

17:05.068 --> 17:07.534
Oh, can't I
do one more?

17:07.569 --> 17:08.901
Well...okay.

17:10.099 --> 17:12.601
You could
sell your blood, Al.

17:12.636 --> 17:15.467
They give you juice
and cookies afterwards.

17:17.534 --> 17:19.534
Gee, Al, if you could
stagger home

17:19.569 --> 17:21.032
without spilling the juice,

17:21.068 --> 17:23.067
that would be dinner
for the family.

17:24.534 --> 17:27.233
Personally, Al,
I admire your conviction.

17:27.269 --> 17:28.868
Throughout history,
many men,

17:28.903 --> 17:30.601
considered great
in retrospect,

17:30.636 --> 17:33.634
had to stand alone
for their beliefs.

17:33.669 --> 17:36.434
Although I think Al's
the first shoe salesman.

17:39.567 --> 17:43.000
We're gonna go upstairs
and listen to some records.

17:43.035 --> 17:45.567
Who's the guy
in the pajamas?

17:45.602 --> 17:47.567
Is that your dad?

17:47.602 --> 17:48.567
Are you kidding?

17:48.602 --> 17:52.501
No, no.
My father's in prison.

17:52.536 --> 17:54.501
Um...

17:54.536 --> 17:57.501
That's just
my mom's boyfriend.

17:57.536 --> 17:58.701
Oh, cool.

18:00.501 --> 18:02.801
Do they
have to be here?

18:02.836 --> 18:05.734
Yes, Al. Until the state
takes them from us.

18:07.534 --> 18:08.534
Hey, Dad.

18:08.569 --> 18:10.200
This is Teddy.

18:10.235 --> 18:13.033
His dad's been unemployed
for seven years.

18:13.068 --> 18:14.534
So he's gonna drop by tomorrow

18:14.569 --> 18:18.033
and teach you how to play
a game called three-card monte.

18:18.068 --> 18:21.033
Yeah, it really gets us through
some hard times,

18:21.068 --> 18:23.234
and it doesn't interfere
with welfare.

18:25.534 --> 18:28.567
Oh, kids, juice and cookies
for supper tomorrow.

18:30.534 --> 18:33.534
I'm sorry, Peg, but after 16
years of marriage,

18:33.569 --> 18:36.534
I have no blood
left to give.

18:36.569 --> 18:38.567
I have no choice,
I'm going back to work.

18:38.602 --> 18:40.067
Oh, that's wonderful, Al.

18:40.102 --> 18:42.567
I'll tell you what, I'll
bring the kids down tomorrow.

18:42.602 --> 18:44.567
You can buy us lunch.

18:44.602 --> 18:47.934
I just love you so much more
when you're not at home.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.167
Poor Al. He really
thought he was somebody.

18:55.202 --> 18:56.501
We knew he wasn't.

18:56.536 --> 18:59.501
Gee, I guess we
should have told him.

18:59.536 --> 19:01.501
You think we should
tell him now?

19:01.536 --> 19:02.868
Yeah.

19:06.501 --> 19:09.701
Al, you're
not somebody.

19:09.736 --> 19:11.968
But then,
neither are we.

19:12.003 --> 19:13.934
Sure, we made
fun of you,

19:13.969 --> 19:15.534
but deep down
we were really hoping

19:15.569 --> 19:17.534
the rich guy
would show.

19:17.569 --> 19:20.067
All of us mall guys
feel that way.

19:20.102 --> 19:22.534
You were right, Ed.

19:22.569 --> 19:25.534
He came crawling back
after one day.

19:25.569 --> 19:27.033
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

19:27.068 --> 19:30.033
<i>Hey, I guess they
ran out of bags</i>

19:30.068 --> 19:31.534
<i>at the jewelry store.</i>

19:31.569 --> 19:35.567
<i>These two guys are carrying
the stuff out loose.</i>

19:35.602 --> 19:37.567
<i>Hey, slow down, boys.</i>

19:37.602 --> 19:41.100
<i>It's too hot to be running
in this heat.</i>

19:45.734 --> 19:48.434
God, this is ugly.

19:48.469 --> 19:51.567
That's your
reflection, Kel.

19:51.602 --> 19:54.067
Hi, honey. I was going
to bring you a sandwich

19:54.102 --> 19:56.667
you know, to save some money,
but then I figured, why bother?

19:56.702 --> 19:57.667
Let's go eat.

19:57.702 --> 19:59.167
Well, well, well.

19:59.202 --> 20:01.167
Prince of
the Penny Loafers.

20:01.202 --> 20:05.868
King of the Canvas-backed
High Tops.

20:05.903 --> 20:07.367
He's back.

20:07.402 --> 20:08.868
You're back.

20:08.903 --> 20:12.234
Well, where's
your pride now, shoe man?

20:14.000 --> 20:16.367
Hey, Al,
isn't she the one

20:16.402 --> 20:18.767
that got wedged
in the escalator?

20:20.400 --> 20:22.200
You must be the wife.

20:22.235 --> 20:26.100
And you must be why
they're starving in China.

20:29.634 --> 20:31.467
Is Al Bundy around?

20:31.502 --> 20:32.467
Over there.

20:32.502 --> 20:33.501
Another spectator.

20:33.536 --> 20:35.868
Go ahead.
Take your shot.

20:35.903 --> 20:37.334
I'm not sure what
you're talking about.

20:37.369 --> 20:40.167
I just want to meet
Al Bundy and shake his hand.

20:40.202 --> 20:41.634
Just who are you?

20:41.669 --> 20:44.400
Gary. Gary Patterson.
I own this place.

20:44.435 --> 20:45.501
You're Ga-

20:45.536 --> 20:46.667
You're Gary?

20:46.702 --> 20:49.501
Our Gary from Gary's
Shoes and Accessories

20:49.536 --> 20:51.267
for Today's Woman?

20:51.302 --> 20:52.534
I'm Al Bundy.

20:52.569 --> 20:53.968
You know something?
I got your letter,

20:54.003 --> 20:55.968
and it really
affected me.

20:56.003 --> 20:57.968
After years of sleeping
with beautiful women

20:58.003 --> 21:00.467
and living life
just for fun,

21:00.502 --> 21:02.968
I thought I'd
visit the trenches,

21:03.003 --> 21:05.767
say thanks, and get
back to the beach.

21:05.802 --> 21:09.133
You know, I know a great beach
over at my house.

21:09.168 --> 21:12.033
Uh, Gar, as you
might have guessed,

21:12.068 --> 21:13.167
this is the wife.

21:16.467 --> 21:17.834
Hit the showers,
Peg.

21:20.467 --> 21:22.467
Al, I want you to know

21:22.502 --> 21:24.801
I appreciate what
you're doing here.

21:24.836 --> 21:28.667
One day, I would like
to have you on my yacht.

21:28.702 --> 21:30.100
Of course I won't,

21:30.135 --> 21:33.000
but I want you to know that the
next beautiful woman I bed down

21:33.035 --> 21:34.834
is dedicated to you.

21:34.869 --> 21:37.534
Could you make it
a blond?

21:37.569 --> 21:40.501
They make life
worth living, don't they?

21:40.536 --> 21:43.501
I wouldn't know.

21:43.536 --> 21:45.501
How about
showing me around?

21:45.536 --> 21:47.000
Sure.

21:47.035 --> 21:50.000
Yeah, well, over here
we have some shoes.

21:50.035 --> 21:52.434
And over here's
more shoes.

21:52.469 --> 21:54.934
Eh, here's
an old bag.

21:54.969 --> 21:57.434
Back here in the stockroom

21:57.469 --> 22:00.734
is where we keep
the rest of the shoes.

22:00.769 --> 22:02.300
Gee, he did it.

22:02.335 --> 22:04.834
He actually
got the owner here.

22:04.869 --> 22:06.968
You should
be proud, kids.

22:07.003 --> 22:09.968
There's a very special
man in there,

22:10.003 --> 22:12.467
and he's talking
to your father.

22:12.502 --> 22:16.200
You see, Daddy
really does count.

22:16.235 --> 22:20.300
Twenty-three, 24, 25.

22:20.335 --> 22:22.133
The deal was for 50.

22:22.168 --> 22:23.467
Worth every penny.

22:23.502 --> 22:26.300
They really thought
you were Gary, Nick.

22:26.335 --> 22:29.133
I've got alimony.
I'll do anything for money.

22:29.168 --> 22:33.200
Twenty-six, 27... excuse me.
