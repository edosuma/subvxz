01:02.020 --> 01:04.519
Do you recognize
anything around here?

01:04.522 --> 01:06.389
Nope. Should I?

01:06.391 --> 01:08.892
You've been here before.

01:08.894 --> 01:13.362
We used to visit Grandpops all the
time when you were a toddler.

01:13.364 --> 01:15.532
I'm really sorry, Mom.

01:15.534 --> 01:18.001
I know, sweetie.

01:18.003 --> 01:20.403
We're all gonna miss him.

01:20.405 --> 01:25.909
Grandpops was a lovely man who,
ugh, boy, I can't even finish that.

01:25.911 --> 01:31.081
Yeah, no, Grandpops was a cranky
old coot who hated everybody.

01:31.083 --> 01:34.650
- He was nice to me.
- Of course he was.

01:34.652 --> 01:38.454
Don't get me wrong,
I loved the old guy.

01:38.456 --> 01:39.722
He...

01:39.724 --> 01:44.296
...just had a funny way of
doing things, you know?

01:47.399 --> 01:50.433
Oh, here we are.

01:50.435 --> 01:54.403
It's the one with the
airplane in the front yard?

01:54.405 --> 01:56.575
Oh, sweet! A plane!

02:03.581 --> 02:07.416
The will said Grandpops
left us everything.

02:07.418 --> 02:10.454
I didn't realize it
meant everything.

02:10.455 --> 02:12.088
What do you think, Chauncey?

02:12.090 --> 02:16.461
I think this carrying case
violates the Geneva Convention.

02:38.617 --> 02:40.616
Bit of a fixer upper, huh?

02:40.618 --> 02:41.920
Yeah.

02:43.122 --> 02:44.055
You must be Grandpop's lawyer.

02:44.057 --> 02:47.157
Not anymore.
Here are the keys to the house.

02:47.159 --> 02:49.459
- Hey, how are ya?
- Oh, what a cute dog!

02:49.461 --> 02:51.160
Oh, thanks.
I've been working out.

02:51.162 --> 02:54.431
I'm glad you like him. He's yours.
He came with the estate.

02:54.433 --> 02:57.134
He's been house-trained
but don't hold him to that.

02:57.136 --> 02:59.770
Oh, and when he gets
excited he falls asleep.

02:59.772 --> 03:02.505
Really?
He's narcoleptic?

03:02.507 --> 03:04.775
Can a dog be narcoleptic?

03:04.777 --> 03:06.675
Hey, boy!
What's your name?

03:06.677 --> 03:08.010
Hey, I'm Skipper!

03:08.012 --> 03:08.945
- Wanna go for a walk?
- Yeah, I wanna go for a walk!

03:08.947 --> 03:09.879
- Wanna go for a walk?
- This is so exciting!

03:09.881 --> 03:12.949
- This is so...
- Come on, come on!

03:15.119 --> 03:18.021
Hm.
I guess they can be narcoleptic.

03:19.624 --> 03:21.158
I'm up, I'm up!
What'd I miss?

03:21.160 --> 03:22.558
Welcome to Allentown!

03:22.560 --> 03:26.366
I did it again, didn't I?
Did I fall asleep?

03:31.503 --> 03:35.374
Well, here we are.

03:36.541 --> 03:38.874
Hey, boy, I'm Jack.
What's your name?

03:38.876 --> 03:41.848
What's my name?
What's in that cage?

03:48.519 --> 03:50.486
Uh...

03:50.488 --> 03:53.490
Skipper, huh? Hey, Mom,
the dog's name is Skipper.

03:53.492 --> 03:55.658
Great.
Does he wanna help clean up?

03:55.660 --> 03:57.629
What? No.

03:59.665 --> 04:01.130
I'll let you two get acquainted.

04:01.132 --> 04:05.504
Wait, you're just gonna leave me
here with this, uh, dog?!

04:08.707 --> 04:12.541
OK, let me try something.
Uh, sit.

04:12.543 --> 04:14.747
Hey, it works.

04:17.516 --> 04:19.582
Hey, bud.

04:19.584 --> 04:21.250
So, what do you think?

04:21.253 --> 04:24.187
I think we should sell this
place as soon as possible.

04:24.189 --> 04:25.889
There's a canoe
in the living room.

04:25.891 --> 04:28.592
- Yeah.
- So, you're a cat, huh?

04:28.594 --> 04:30.227
No, I'm a giraffe.

04:30.229 --> 04:32.896
Wanna see the
basement? We have mice.

04:32.898 --> 04:34.898
Well, I do like mice.

04:34.900 --> 04:36.600
Come on.
Let's check it out.

04:36.602 --> 04:39.569
I'll show ya.
Just down here.

04:39.571 --> 04:42.204
But it's a pretty
nice town, right?

04:42.206 --> 04:44.076
Yeah, I guess so.

04:46.578 --> 04:48.745
What're you looking
at me like that for?

04:48.747 --> 04:50.913
Look, there's, um...

04:50.915 --> 04:53.083
...something I've been
meaning to tell you.

04:54.186 --> 04:56.119
What was that?

04:56.121 --> 04:58.855
Uh, they said there might
be rats in the basement.

04:58.857 --> 05:01.023
That sounds like a big rat.

05:01.025 --> 05:01.958
Yeah.

05:01.960 --> 05:03.593
That was the dog.

05:03.595 --> 05:05.629
Oh, Chauncey.

05:05.631 --> 05:08.131
Was that you making
all that racket? Come here.

05:08.133 --> 05:13.136
And I am
not cleaning it up.

05:13.138 --> 05:16.673
Hey, check it out.
Look what I found.

05:16.675 --> 05:17.973
Dog treats.

05:17.975 --> 05:20.043
Let's crack this
bad boy open, Jack!

05:20.045 --> 05:22.612
Hey there, Skipper.
What'd you find there, buddy?

05:22.614 --> 05:24.980
I just told you, dog treats.

05:24.982 --> 05:26.917
I don't know if you
wanna eat these, Skipper.

05:26.919 --> 05:30.153
Contains propylene
glycol, arsenic,

05:30.155 --> 05:32.656
and imported Soviet
cattle parts?

05:32.658 --> 05:34.824
This bag is from 1973!

05:34.826 --> 05:35.624
1973!

05:35.626 --> 05:37.793
Skipper, where are
you going, buddy?

05:37.795 --> 05:39.261
Oh, boy, open
the door, open the door!

05:39.263 --> 05:42.132
- I gotta go!
- Skipper?

05:42.134 --> 05:43.667
Skipper, where are you going?

05:43.669 --> 05:44.800
It's not gonna be pretty.

05:44.802 --> 05:45.935
- Stay back, Jack.
- Skipper, wait up, bud.

05:45.937 --> 05:47.170
Stay here if you know
what's good for you.

05:47.172 --> 05:50.142
- Just trust me.
- Skipper, come on.

05:53.645 --> 05:55.644
Who the heck are you?

05:55.646 --> 05:57.781
Who the heck am I?
Who the heck are you?

05:57.783 --> 05:59.648
I'm Jack.

05:59.650 --> 06:03.319
This is, was my
Grandpop's place.

06:03.321 --> 06:06.355
- What do you mean was?
- He, uh...

06:06.357 --> 06:07.790
...passed away.

06:07.792 --> 06:09.658
Oh, jeez.

06:09.660 --> 06:11.860
- Sorry.
- What're you doing here?

06:15.734 --> 06:17.033
Run, Twyla!
I can take him!

06:17.035 --> 06:19.002
Run, before Old Man
Cragmore gets here!

06:19.004 --> 06:21.036
Oh, hey, a dog!

06:21.038 --> 06:24.940
Sorry about that. Fred here
is a little overprotective.

06:24.942 --> 06:26.942
So what do you guys need?

06:26.944 --> 06:30.045
Over the years we've lost a
lot of stuff over this fence.

06:30.047 --> 06:32.983
Mr. Cragmore, your Grandpops,
would never give anything back.

06:32.985 --> 06:34.817
- Ever.
- What kind of stuff?

06:34.819 --> 06:37.286
Footballs, baseballs,
kites, basketballs,

06:37.288 --> 06:38.988
my Baby Googie glider.

06:38.990 --> 06:40.689
Baby Googie glider?

06:40.691 --> 06:42.091
Sorry to sneak in like this.

06:42.093 --> 06:43.326
We thought we could get in the
back without being noticed.

06:43.328 --> 06:45.765
Let's go look in the shed.

06:53.071 --> 06:54.340
Nothing here.

06:57.141 --> 06:58.841
Jack!

06:58.843 --> 07:02.714
I gotta go. I can check
in the basement later.

07:08.886 --> 07:10.819
Who's that girl?

07:10.821 --> 07:13.692
- Just a girl.
- She's cute.

07:18.196 --> 07:23.733
So...
it's pretty great here, hey?

07:23.735 --> 07:25.100
Yeah, I guess so.

07:26.704 --> 07:30.105
Can't you just
smell the fresh air?

07:30.107 --> 07:32.374
OK, what's going on here, Mom?

07:32.376 --> 07:34.110
Wouldn't it be
great to live here?

07:34.112 --> 07:37.747
No, thanks, I'm
more of a city kid.

07:40.451 --> 07:43.786
You're kidding me!
We're moving here?

07:43.788 --> 07:45.788
You never said anything
about moving here!

07:45.790 --> 07:47.891
- I hinted at it.
- I'm 12.

07:47.893 --> 07:50.125
Hints bounce off me like
bullets off Superman.

07:50.127 --> 07:51.728
Come on, Jack.

07:51.730 --> 07:53.762
We've been in that tiny,
cramped apartment

07:53.764 --> 07:55.230
in the city for so long.

07:55.232 --> 07:56.800
It's not cramped.

07:56.802 --> 07:58.901
You sleep on a
cot in the kitchen.

07:58.903 --> 08:00.803
You know I like
breakfast in bed.

08:00.805 --> 08:03.072
We need more space.
And we need a change.

08:03.074 --> 08:05.374
But I like the apartment.
It's big enough!

08:05.376 --> 08:09.278
For two people,
a cat, and now a dog?

08:09.280 --> 08:13.216
The bank says I can transfer
my position to a branch here.

08:13.218 --> 08:15.918
- If I pass the interview.
- But I like the city.

08:15.920 --> 08:18.454
I like my school,
I like my friends.

08:18.456 --> 08:21.760
- This is so unfair!
- Jack!

08:22.994 --> 08:24.961
Take Skipper with you!

08:29.333 --> 08:31.800
That went well.

08:31.802 --> 08:33.302
<i>Why would anyone want to move</i>

08:33.304 --> 08:37.808
<i>to a stupid, boring, small
town like this anyways?</i>

08:44.783 --> 08:45.818
<i>Boringville.</i>

08:46.817 --> 08:49.918
<i>What is Mom even thinking?</i>

08:49.920 --> 08:51.354
<i>This is so lame.</i>

08:51.356 --> 08:54.827
<i>Why would anyone
wanna live here?</i>

09:08.006 --> 09:09.341
Whoa.

09:13.145 --> 09:16.012
Whoa, indeed.

09:16.014 --> 09:19.885
- Who's that?
- That's what I'd like to know.

09:32.564 --> 09:35.331
Mmm, that's premium dog food.

09:35.333 --> 09:39.869
Side of Chewy Bones,
light tones of almond.

09:39.871 --> 09:42.538
And if I'm not mistaken, you've
been drinking from the toilet.

09:42.540 --> 09:45.041
Ew! That dog is sniffing
Mandy's butt!

09:45.043 --> 09:47.911
Excuse me, can you please get that
animal away from Mandy's butt?

09:47.913 --> 09:50.379
Uh, sorry, sorry.
That's just how they say hello.

09:50.381 --> 09:51.413
Skipper.

09:51.415 --> 09:54.017
Yeah, duh. I know that.

09:54.019 --> 09:55.118
Why else would he be doing that?

09:55.120 --> 09:57.553
Did that disgusting junkyard
animal scare you, sweetie?

09:57.555 --> 10:00.190
Yeah, she did kinda
scare me a little.

10:00.192 --> 10:01.924
Oh, you're talking to her.

10:01.926 --> 10:04.494
Then that makes me the, uh...
Hey!

10:04.496 --> 10:07.897
Imagine if
people said hello like that.

10:07.899 --> 10:11.868
You know, like, sniffed
each other's butts.

10:11.870 --> 10:13.570
That's gross.
You're gross.

10:13.572 --> 10:17.039
No, I'm not. I'm Jack.
I just moved here.

10:17.041 --> 10:19.008
- Yay for you.
- OK.

10:19.010 --> 10:22.077
Um, that's a nice
bag you got there.

10:22.079 --> 10:24.447
Where'd you get it?
The library?

10:24.449 --> 10:27.015
- Smooth.
- Really?

10:27.017 --> 10:30.953
This lame tote bag that my
mom got from work is nice?

10:30.955 --> 10:33.188
- Do you want it?
- No, that's OK.

10:33.190 --> 10:35.091
Yeesh. Tough room.

10:35.093 --> 10:37.527
- Um, what's your name?
- My name?

10:37.529 --> 10:39.899
It's stop talking to me.

10:41.466 --> 10:43.899
What is that, French?

10:43.901 --> 10:46.436
Who's she calling a
junkyard animal, anyway?

10:46.438 --> 10:47.269
Hmm.

10:47.271 --> 10:49.938
Oh, so suddenly this
town's not so bad.

10:49.940 --> 10:52.408
Notice of eviction?

10:52.410 --> 10:54.980
We're getting kicked out?

10:57.649 --> 10:59.115
Sorry, Mom.

10:59.117 --> 11:03.919
It's OK, I kinda
sprang this all on you.

11:03.921 --> 11:06.623
I wasn't gone that long,
are you OK?

11:06.625 --> 11:11.326
Huh? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Fine.

11:11.328 --> 11:13.996
Listen,
Mr. Storms Out In A Huff,

11:13.998 --> 11:15.431
you have a job to do.

11:15.433 --> 11:19.434
- I do?
- The basement is a disaster.

11:19.436 --> 11:21.336
It needs to be
cleaned and organized.

11:21.338 --> 11:24.974
- Yeah, no problem.
- Thanks.

11:24.976 --> 11:27.110
Love you!

11:36.954 --> 11:41.023
What is that smell?

11:41.025 --> 11:43.596
Well, let's get to it.

12:35.747 --> 12:37.315
Gunther.

12:38.183 --> 12:40.416
Ronnie!

12:40.418 --> 12:42.217
Gunther.

12:42.219 --> 12:46.054
Keep walking forwards,
you're so close!

12:46.056 --> 12:48.023
Gunther!

12:48.025 --> 12:50.360
- Yes!
- Sorry.

12:50.362 --> 12:52.227
You look like a Ronnie.

12:52.229 --> 12:53.462
I get that a lot.

12:53.464 --> 12:57.600
- Yes.
- So have you acquired transportation?

12:57.602 --> 13:00.403
Oh, oh, oh.

13:00.405 --> 13:04.072
Ah, car alarms.
So obnoxious.

13:04.074 --> 13:05.674
- Shh.
- Oh dear. Oh, no.

13:05.676 --> 13:06.509
I got it, I got it.

13:06.511 --> 13:08.443
- You got...
- That's the panic button!

13:08.445 --> 13:10.779
- No, it's...
- I got it!

13:12.050 --> 13:14.082
Ah, that's better.
Thank you.

13:17.689 --> 13:21.190
I hope you have acquired
accommodations then.

13:21.192 --> 13:24.126
Oh, accommodations.
Top notch!

13:24.128 --> 13:25.293
They're never gonna
know we're there.

13:25.295 --> 13:28.297
Perfect. OK.
And you're sure no one is home?

13:28.299 --> 13:30.099
Positive.
I checked it out.

13:30.101 --> 13:32.601
The old guy croaked,
no family, no friends,

13:32.603 --> 13:34.302
so the place is all ours.

13:34.304 --> 13:37.206
It's gonna be like taking
candy from a kitten.

13:41.112 --> 13:44.212
Wait, I thought you
take candy from a baby.

13:44.214 --> 13:47.582
A baby? No. Kitten.
You take candy from a kitten.

13:47.584 --> 13:50.653
But why would a kitten be
walking around with a candy?

13:50.655 --> 13:52.621
Why would you give a baby candy?
It's unhealthy!

13:52.623 --> 13:54.756
- It's delicious.
- Just take this!

13:54.758 --> 13:57.328
Ah, yes. Baklava.

14:03.267 --> 14:04.402
Let's do it!

14:07.204 --> 14:09.337
You know,
you're shorter than I thought.

14:09.339 --> 14:11.343
I'm short in photos.

14:13.178 --> 14:15.177
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

14:15.179 --> 14:20.450
You go through the window, come
around and open the door for me.

14:20.452 --> 14:22.851
But you're shorter than I am.

14:22.853 --> 14:26.589
Yeah, but you're
taller than I am!

14:26.591 --> 14:28.523
- I didn't really think about it that way.
- Right?

14:28.525 --> 14:29.859
That makes sense a
lot with the physics...

14:29.861 --> 14:31.193
Let's just do this!

14:31.195 --> 14:34.098
Okay.
Pardon me.

14:35.232 --> 14:36.765
One more time.

14:36.767 --> 14:38.603
Yeah, that's right.

14:40.237 --> 14:41.305
Ready?

14:42.806 --> 14:44.208
Go!

14:59.256 --> 15:00.690
What're you doing?

15:02.327 --> 15:03.629
Idiot.

15:09.567 --> 15:11.900
How do we know what
we're looking for?

15:11.902 --> 15:13.735
A box with a key.

15:13.737 --> 15:18.374
The old guy hid the treasure
somewhere in this house.

15:18.376 --> 15:20.208
But how are we gonna find it?

15:20.210 --> 15:23.513
Oh, sweet Ronnie,
that's what this is for.

15:23.515 --> 15:25.280
Oh, boy!

15:25.282 --> 15:28.283
- What is that?
- A scanner.

15:28.285 --> 15:30.418
This is so exciting.

15:30.420 --> 15:34.389
When we find the box
the scanner will change color.

15:35.859 --> 15:39.397
The box is behind
the wall right here.

15:43.601 --> 15:46.505
- Too much club.
- Just a little bit.

15:50.275 --> 15:52.240
One...

15:52.242 --> 15:53.743
Two...

15:55.713 --> 15:57.312
Abort! Abort!

15:57.314 --> 15:59.615
Go! Go!
Get out of here!

15:59.617 --> 16:01.249
Ow, my toe!

16:02.686 --> 16:05.221
Mom! Mom!

16:05.223 --> 16:06.389
Jack! Jacky boy!

16:06.391 --> 16:09.424
Is that you?
What's going on down here?

16:09.426 --> 16:11.626
Can you smell that?
I smell schnitzel.

16:11.628 --> 16:12.861
- Is that schnitzel?
- Jack?

16:12.863 --> 16:15.264
- I think it's schnitzel.
- Jack, what's wrong? Are you OK?

16:15.266 --> 16:18.466
I just saw two
guys go out of there!

16:18.468 --> 16:20.769
- What?
- Ok, I'm smelling schnitzel somewhere.

16:20.771 --> 16:23.639
There was two guys
in masks that just left.

16:23.641 --> 16:24.974
Jack,
do you smell that?

16:24.976 --> 16:26.708
- Anybody? Kim, come on.
- There's nobody here, Jack.

16:26.710 --> 16:28.344
Have you
ever had fresh schnitzel?

16:28.346 --> 16:29.445
There was just two guys.

16:29.447 --> 16:31.447
Probably
my favorite meal.

16:31.449 --> 16:33.416
Are you sure
it wasn't raccoons?

16:33.418 --> 16:37.253
- Raccoons?
- Mom, it would have been really tall raccoons.

16:37.255 --> 16:39.322
Spaghetti and
meatballs and schnitzel.

16:39.324 --> 16:41.423
I do like spaghetti
and meatballs.

16:41.425 --> 16:43.658
You don't believe me.

16:43.660 --> 16:48.364
Oh, Jack. Come here.
Of course I believe you!

16:48.366 --> 16:54.637
But why would two men in masks
wanna break into this dusty old,

16:54.639 --> 16:56.639
well, actually,
not so dusty anymore,

16:56.641 --> 16:59.475
thanks for dusting, basement?

16:59.477 --> 17:03.314
I don't know, to steal
the old toaster oven?

17:04.949 --> 17:08.349
Great, thank you
so much, officer.

17:08.352 --> 17:12.324
I really, really appreciate it.
OK, goodnight.

17:18.997 --> 17:21.029
What did they say?

17:21.031 --> 17:25.034
They said we should change
the lock on the cellar door.

17:25.036 --> 17:28.471
Not that there's any point.

17:28.473 --> 17:29.939
What's going on?

17:29.941 --> 17:34.309
I didn't want to tell you
until tomorrow but um...

17:34.311 --> 17:36.378
I got some troubling news today.

17:36.380 --> 17:38.681
Mom, come on.
It's gonna be OK.

17:38.683 --> 17:40.016
We'll make the best of it.

17:40.018 --> 17:42.354
Whatever it is,
we'll get through it.

17:46.390 --> 17:49.460
Come on.
We're in this together.

17:50.994 --> 17:53.962
I know.
You're right.

17:53.964 --> 17:57.368
Now, what's the problem?

17:58.636 --> 17:59.669
We're gonna lose our house!

17:59.671 --> 18:01.971
Your mom didn't know about
this when you moved in?

18:01.973 --> 18:03.372
No one told us.

18:03.374 --> 18:05.840
Dude, this town is
like 1,000 years old.

18:05.842 --> 18:07.742
The underground water
pipes are all rusted out.

18:07.744 --> 18:09.511
They need to be
ripped out and replaced.

18:09.513 --> 18:11.380
So why don't they just do it?

18:11.382 --> 18:13.348
Well, it costs
millions of dollars

18:13.350 --> 18:15.384
and the town just
doesn't have the money.

18:15.386 --> 18:16.585
If the pipes don't get replaced

18:16.587 --> 18:18.054
the government is gonna
come in and declare

18:18.056 --> 18:20.756
this town is blighted and they're
gonna make everyone move.

18:20.758 --> 18:22.525
Blighted?
What does that mean?

18:22.527 --> 18:24.727
It's basically when they
declare the town is dead,

18:24.729 --> 18:26.862
and they make everyone
pack up and ship out.

18:26.864 --> 18:30.732
- That's terrible.
- Yeah. Welcome to my world.

18:30.734 --> 18:34.103
So why do you think those
guys broke into your basement?

18:34.105 --> 18:36.538
Maybe they lost some balls
over Mr. Cragmore's fence,

18:36.540 --> 18:38.441
and wanted them
back like we did.

18:38.443 --> 18:39.911
Fred, stop trying to help.

18:41.078 --> 18:43.479
Oh.

18:44.448 --> 18:47.450
- What do you see?
- Nothing.

18:47.452 --> 18:51.386
I want to see!

18:51.388 --> 18:53.122
Wow, who would have
thought that someone

18:53.124 --> 18:56.726
would have moved in so soon
after the old guy croaked?

18:56.728 --> 19:00.596
You, that's who.
You were supposed to know.

19:00.598 --> 19:03.098
Oh, you're right,
you're right.

19:03.100 --> 19:06.501
You got me there.
That was my bad.

19:06.503 --> 19:09.105
Ugh, so dizzy.

19:10.808 --> 19:13.576
You know, it was
supposed to be easy.

19:13.578 --> 19:16.612
Sneak into the basement
like the silent shadow,

19:16.614 --> 19:18.748
break down that wall
like conquering army,

19:18.750 --> 19:21.817
triumphantly steal that box
like high seas buccaneer.

19:21.819 --> 19:23.152
- Yes!
- Voila!

19:23.154 --> 19:24.119
Right!

19:24.121 --> 19:26.888
Except all we have
is <i>ein</i> broken toe

19:26.890 --> 19:29.657
because you cannot maintain
your grip on the hammer.

19:29.659 --> 19:32.827
A broken toe?
You're not even limping!

19:32.829 --> 19:35.730
Well, I am mentally disciplined
to ignore extreme pain.

19:35.732 --> 19:39.468
- Ah.
- It's also how I contend with your filthy presence.

19:39.470 --> 19:41.903
Question.

19:41.905 --> 19:44.839
- Hmm?
- What is a <i>schweinhund?</i>

19:44.841 --> 19:48.176
Well, it's German for pig dog.

19:48.178 --> 19:50.846
Oh.
I thought it was a compliment.

19:50.848 --> 19:53.182
Oh, you will get no
compliments from me.

19:53.184 --> 19:56.751
Only degradation and mockery
until we find that box.

19:56.753 --> 20:01.524
- That's fair.
- We will go back tonight.

20:05.663 --> 20:07.863
Oh, baby, daddy missed you!

20:08.933 --> 20:10.935
Whoa, yeah!

20:22.113 --> 20:23.979
Hey, it's OK.

20:23.981 --> 20:25.980
It's OK, we... we can get
you another one.

20:25.982 --> 20:27.650
Wow, this kid's
taking this pretty hard.

20:27.652 --> 20:28.651
Do you mean for real?

20:28.653 --> 20:30.819
- Yeah, yeah, of course.
- We'll get another one.

20:30.821 --> 20:34.824
What's that smell?

20:34.826 --> 20:36.025
Skipper,
where you going, boy?

20:36.027 --> 20:38.160
Hey, guys, check this out.
Oh, right, sorry.

20:53.743 --> 20:56.045
- Was this here last night?
- Definitely not.

20:56.047 --> 20:58.047
I cleaned this place last night.

21:01.085 --> 21:03.853
What is it, Skipper?
Whatcha doing there, boy?

21:03.855 --> 21:06.622
What do you think? I'm trying
to tell you something.

21:06.624 --> 21:08.257
I think he's trying
to tell us something.

21:08.259 --> 21:11.727
Jack, there's
something behind this wall.

21:11.729 --> 21:13.628
There's definitely
something behind that wall.

21:13.630 --> 21:16.600
You're a genius, kid.
My work here is done.

21:18.636 --> 21:21.839
- Should we do it?
- Do it.

21:37.120 --> 21:39.790
There's something back there.

21:45.896 --> 21:47.566
It's a box.

21:50.768 --> 21:53.969
It's got your name on it.

21:53.971 --> 21:56.942
Well, you should
do the honors.

22:01.578 --> 22:02.547
That's it?

22:08.719 --> 22:12.688
I was expecting, like,
a treasure or something.

22:12.690 --> 22:16.325
A key and...
what is this?

22:16.327 --> 22:17.561
A box?

22:20.764 --> 22:22.163
How do you open it?

22:22.165 --> 22:23.766
It's a videotape, Jack.

22:23.768 --> 22:26.301
Don't look at it! What if it's
cursed and seven days later

22:26.303 --> 22:30.739
a long-haired girl
crawls out of your TV?

22:30.741 --> 22:33.677
I watch a lot of horror movies.

22:37.682 --> 22:39.251
You know what?

22:40.818 --> 22:43.954
I think I can make
this thing work.

22:44.922 --> 22:48.624
And that should do it.

22:48.626 --> 22:49.959
Where did you
learn how to do that?

22:49.961 --> 22:52.361
A/V club at school.

22:52.363 --> 22:54.732
We still use videotapes.

22:56.767 --> 22:58.800
We're poorly-funded.

22:58.802 --> 23:00.134
Me there also, school.

23:04.841 --> 23:06.808
That's my grandpa!

23:06.810 --> 23:10.045
<i>Jack. You found the box,</i>

23:10.047 --> 23:14.048
<i>which means your old
Grandpops is a goner.</i>

23:14.050 --> 23:17.155
<i>Don't worry,
I lived a good life.</i>

23:18.755 --> 23:21.323
<i>I used to be a news cameraman.</i>

23:21.325 --> 23:24.996
<i>Traveled the world,
met lots of people.</i>

23:25.829 --> 23:27.863
<i>Most of them all jerks.</i>

23:27.865 --> 23:30.065
<i>You and your mom are
the only folks I know</i>

23:30.067 --> 23:31.799
<i>who aren't total jerks.</i>

23:31.801 --> 23:33.836
<i>Like that one kid who
keeps bothering me</i>

23:33.838 --> 23:36.771
<i>about his stupid glider!</i>

23:36.773 --> 23:37.839
Hey!

23:37.841 --> 23:38.774
- Shhh.
- Shhh.

23:38.776 --> 23:40.342
<i>Baby Googie, my butt.</i>

23:40.344 --> 23:45.247
<i>Jack, years ago,
I was on an assignment</i>

23:45.249 --> 23:49.852
<i>with this German reporter
lady in South America</i>

23:49.854 --> 23:53.355
<i>and we made an
amazing discovery.</i>

23:55.425 --> 23:57.726
<i>But there was problems.</i>

23:57.728 --> 24:01.696
<i>She wanted to steal it
and I outfoxed her</i>

24:01.698 --> 24:04.767
<i>and I got the treasure.</i>

24:04.769 --> 24:05.835
<i>Then I hid it.</i>

24:05.837 --> 24:08.103
Why didn't he just cash
it in and live like a king?

24:08.105 --> 24:09.872
- Quiet.
- Quiet.

24:09.874 --> 24:11.740
<i>You're probably wondering
why I didn't cash it in</i>

24:11.742 --> 24:14.876
<i>and live like a king.</i>

24:14.878 --> 24:18.780
<i>Because I'm not a greedy
idiot, that's why.</i>

24:18.782 --> 24:19.882
This is a long story.

24:19.884 --> 24:23.218
<i>I hid it somewhere
around this town.</i>

24:23.220 --> 24:26.422
<i>So Jack, it's yours to find.</i>

24:26.424 --> 24:29.223
<i>But be warned:
don't tell anyone,</i>

24:29.225 --> 24:33.394
<i>especially a German woman,
that's for sure.</i>

24:33.396 --> 24:35.798
<i>Not even your mother.</i>

24:35.800 --> 24:40.769
<i>Grown-ups, even the ones
that mean well, are greedy!</i>

24:40.771 --> 24:43.305
<i>If they find out about my
treasure they'll cash it in</i>

24:43.307 --> 24:47.942
<i>before you can say, "That kid's
never getting his glider back!"</i>

24:47.944 --> 24:49.811
Yeah, well I did get
it back, you old coot!

24:49.813 --> 24:52.780
- Quiet, Fred!
- Really, Fred, be quiet!

24:52.782 --> 24:55.284
<i>The first clue is...</i>

25:05.296 --> 25:06.765
<i>Just kidding.</i>

25:09.066 --> 25:12.934
<i>The clue is inside</i>

25:12.936 --> 25:16.875
<i>the very first book
I ever read to you.</i>

25:18.309 --> 25:20.476
What's the first book
he ever read to you?

25:20.478 --> 25:23.811
I... I don't remember.

25:23.813 --> 25:26.250
Maybe your mom will know.

25:27.318 --> 25:28.787
Let's go check.

25:38.928 --> 25:41.930
You guys gonna be
OK while I'm out?

25:41.932 --> 25:44.799
Yeah, we'll be fine.
Good luck at your interview.

25:44.801 --> 25:46.501
Thank you.
Do I look OK?

25:46.503 --> 25:47.869
Yeah, you look good.

25:47.871 --> 25:50.338
You look great.
If I could whistle, I would.

25:50.340 --> 25:52.874
Do you remember Grandpops
ever reading me any books?

25:52.876 --> 25:56.878
Yeah, he read to you all the
time when you were little. Why?

25:56.880 --> 25:58.146
Well, the treasure...

25:58.148 --> 26:00.182
Just curious.

26:00.184 --> 26:03.551
He never read you
kids books though,

26:03.553 --> 26:04.886
he thought kids
books were annoying

26:04.888 --> 26:06.821
and he hated all
the stupid pictures.

26:06.823 --> 26:08.222
Yeah, that sounds
like him alright.

26:08.224 --> 26:10.526
Yeah.
He always read you stories

26:10.528 --> 26:13.060
from this old travel
almanac he liked.

26:13.062 --> 26:15.864
Oh, yeah, I remember that.
Have you seen it anywhere?

26:15.866 --> 26:18.866
No, but he did keep a
lot of books at his shop.

26:18.868 --> 26:21.202
- Grandpops owned a shop?
- Yeah, he doesn't anymore

26:21.204 --> 26:24.205
but he owned an antique
store over on Sierra Street.

26:24.207 --> 26:26.141
- Come on, let's go.
- Well, wait, wait, wait.

26:26.143 --> 26:27.476
He doesn't own it anymore.

26:27.478 --> 26:31.579
That's OK, we're
just gonna take a look.

26:31.581 --> 26:34.883
Did I just see a 12-year-old
get excited about antiques?

26:34.885 --> 26:37.251
Don't judge,
it's just a phase.

26:37.253 --> 26:38.923
I'm gonna take a nap.

26:43.894 --> 26:48.396
I remember the book had something to do
with adventures or worlds or something,

26:48.398 --> 26:52.366
but I do remember it had
an old leather bound cover.

26:52.368 --> 26:54.936
Are we really gonna try
and find this treasure?

26:54.938 --> 26:57.372
Yeah. Those guys broke into
my house looking for it.

26:57.374 --> 27:00.374
We can't let them get
their hands on it.

27:00.376 --> 27:03.912
What're you gonna
do with the treasure?

27:03.914 --> 27:07.417
I don't know. I haven't thought
that far ahead yet.

27:37.982 --> 27:39.080
Hey!

28:13.183 --> 28:15.983
Closed
until further notice?

28:15.985 --> 28:17.618
Well, that was fun.
Let's go home.

28:17.620 --> 28:21.258
It's not just closed,
it's completely locked up.

28:25.328 --> 28:27.962
Whaddya suppose they're
doin' in that store?

28:27.964 --> 28:29.064
I do not know.

28:29.066 --> 28:31.432
But I'll bet it has something
to do with the treasure.

28:31.434 --> 28:33.335
- Yeah.
- Let's go back to his house

28:33.337 --> 28:36.505
and see if we can
find another clue.

28:36.507 --> 28:39.510
That's a great idea, Gunther!

28:42.378 --> 28:46.181
The city must
have shut it down.

28:46.183 --> 28:49.651
But if the city shut it down
that means the city council

28:49.653 --> 28:52.153
should still have keys, right?

28:52.155 --> 28:54.959
Which means I have an idea.
Follow me.

29:01.130 --> 29:01.997
That's Jennifer.

29:01.999 --> 29:04.199
We were best friends
when we were little.

29:04.201 --> 29:07.669
Oh, so that's her name.
Jennifer.

29:07.671 --> 29:11.673
- Oh, you met her?
- Yeah, kinda...

29:11.675 --> 29:13.575
- Was she mean to you?
- Yeah.

29:13.577 --> 29:16.243
- She's always mean to nerds.
- I'm not a nerd.

29:16.245 --> 29:18.113
Then why wasn't
she nice to you?

29:18.115 --> 29:19.347
Are you implying
that I'm a nerd?

29:19.349 --> 29:21.083
Well, if she's only
mean to nerds, then...

29:21.085 --> 29:23.585
Ok, how can she help us?
Her mom's a big shot.

29:23.587 --> 29:25.053
Town councilor,
works for the mayor.

29:25.055 --> 29:27.489
Librarian. She'll have a key
to that padlock.

29:27.491 --> 29:29.057
Awesome.

29:29.059 --> 29:33.028
Except we're kinda
total enemies now.

29:33.030 --> 29:34.229
Oh.

29:34.231 --> 29:36.064
But I've got an
ace up my sleeve.

29:36.066 --> 29:37.535
One second.

29:41.070 --> 29:43.505
Well, if it isn't Twyla,
mistress of the dark.

29:44.742 --> 29:46.107
Can I talk to you, Jen?

29:46.109 --> 29:49.544
- Go ahead.
- Privately?

29:49.546 --> 29:52.383
Do we have to go into a crypt?

29:53.183 --> 29:55.153
Here is fine.

29:58.222 --> 30:00.622
So, do you play any sports?

30:00.624 --> 30:02.057
Beach volleyball.

30:02.059 --> 30:03.458
Oh, there's
beaches around here?

30:03.460 --> 30:06.428
No, no. I just meant volleyball
with a beach ball.

30:06.430 --> 30:07.695
Oh, so you're in a league?

30:07.697 --> 30:10.798
No, just with,
like, my friends.

30:10.800 --> 30:12.401
Who? Twyla?

30:12.403 --> 30:14.301
No, just, you know.

30:14.303 --> 30:17.204
No, I don't know.
Isn't Twyla your only friend?

30:17.206 --> 30:18.306
Well, yeah.

30:18.308 --> 30:20.776
So who do you play
beach volleyball with?

30:20.778 --> 30:22.277
Just me.

30:22.279 --> 30:25.146
So long story short,
you own a beach ball.

30:25.148 --> 30:26.414
Yep, that's about it.

30:26.416 --> 30:29.151
- So no sports?
- Yep, I don't play any sports.

30:29.153 --> 30:30.419
- That's cool.
- Mm-hmm.

30:30.421 --> 30:32.119
Alright, we're
all set for tonight.

30:32.121 --> 30:33.622
She'll meet us
there with the key.

30:33.624 --> 30:35.790
Are you sure she'll show?
She looks mad.

30:37.261 --> 30:40.295
Yeah, she'll show.
I told her that if she didn't

30:40.297 --> 30:44.165
I would show this to
all of her friends.

30:44.167 --> 30:47.134
Yeah, we went through a
pretty serious mime phase.

30:47.136 --> 30:49.837
You're evil.

30:49.839 --> 30:52.840
<i>Even the ones that
mean well are greedy.</i>

30:52.842 --> 30:54.576
<i>They find out
about my treasure,</i>

30:54.578 --> 30:56.178
<i>they'll cash it in
before you can say,</i>

30:56.180 --> 31:00.115
<i>"That kid's never
getting his glider back!"</i>

31:02.319 --> 31:04.786
<i>The first clue is...</i>

31:13.163 --> 31:14.328
<i>Just kidding.</i>

31:14.330 --> 31:18.299
<i>The clue is inside</i>

31:18.301 --> 31:22.336
<i>the very first book
I ever read to you.</i>

31:22.338 --> 31:25.207
So what're we to do? We search
the house for the book?

31:25.209 --> 31:27.709
No. The book must be
at the antique store

31:27.711 --> 31:29.344
where the kids were.

31:29.346 --> 31:31.680
But it's all locked up.
How're we gonna get in?

31:31.682 --> 31:33.347
- Idiot!
- Ow!

31:33.349 --> 31:36.518
I mean, we are devious
criminals! We just break in!

31:36.520 --> 31:40.154
Ooooh, I get it!

31:40.156 --> 31:42.324
- Ah.
- That's a great idea!

31:42.326 --> 31:44.162
Well, I came up with it.

31:46.896 --> 31:49.564
- Is it good?
- It's not bad.

31:49.566 --> 31:51.469
May I have a piece?

31:52.735 --> 31:54.171
<i>Danke.</i>

32:00.676 --> 32:05.247
Hey, Jackie Boy,
your girlfriend's here.

32:05.249 --> 32:06.347
You never said he'd be here.

32:06.349 --> 32:08.282
Nice to see you again, too.

32:08.284 --> 32:09.250
Oh, oh, what was that?

32:09.252 --> 32:11.853
Sarcasm?

32:11.855 --> 32:13.888
Yep, definitely sarcasm.

32:13.890 --> 32:16.490
Whatever, let's just
get this over with.

32:16.492 --> 32:18.226
Hi, Jennifer.

32:18.228 --> 32:19.394
Why are you
talking to me, Fred?

32:19.396 --> 32:21.563
Do you remember the rule?
There's no talking to Jennifer.

32:21.565 --> 32:23.765
No talking to Jennifer?
That's a rule?

32:23.767 --> 32:25.901
Right, sorry.
No talking to Jennifer.

32:25.903 --> 32:27.269
I forgot the rule.

32:27.271 --> 32:29.237
- Nice backbone, Fred.
- Thank you.

32:29.239 --> 32:31.673
That's OK, Fred.
You've got my love.

32:31.675 --> 32:33.374
OK, so just so we're clear,

32:33.376 --> 32:35.376
if you guys get caught I
had nothing to do with this.

32:35.378 --> 32:39.314
- Are you coming with us?
- To find some old book?

32:39.316 --> 32:42.416
No thanks, Vampirella.

32:42.418 --> 32:44.419
Fine, then give us the keys.

32:46.423 --> 32:48.589
OK, I'm gonna need these back.

32:48.591 --> 32:50.959
I'll be waiting
across the street.

32:50.961 --> 32:54.296
Which one is it?
There's like 50 keys.

32:54.298 --> 32:56.701
It's the one that
opens the lock. Duh.

33:00.803 --> 33:02.604
So we're looking for a book?

33:02.606 --> 33:04.972
- Yes.
- What kind of book?

33:04.974 --> 33:07.878
We will know it
when we see it.

33:11.280 --> 33:14.719
It must be those
meddling kids. And that dog!

33:18.454 --> 33:20.488
What do you need that for?

33:20.490 --> 33:24.259
For pulling a heist. You pull a
heist, you bring a flashlight.

33:24.261 --> 33:26.627
It's the rules of the street.

33:26.629 --> 33:28.598
It's daytime, Fred.

33:31.501 --> 33:32.567
Shh!

33:32.569 --> 33:34.301
They're gonna hear us!

33:34.303 --> 33:36.438
No kidding, swine monkey!

33:36.440 --> 33:40.342
- Is that a compliment?
- Yeeeee, no.

33:40.344 --> 33:41.542
Do you know the
title of the book?

33:41.544 --> 33:45.846
Uh, it was <i>Travel
World</i> or <i>Book</i> or...

33:45.848 --> 33:49.951
- I don't know.
- OK. Let's split up.

33:49.953 --> 33:53.755
OK, boy, time to put that
nose of yours to work.

33:53.757 --> 33:56.490
See if you can sniff out
Grandpop's scent in this place.

33:56.492 --> 33:59.594
Well, this whole
place smells like Grandpops.

33:59.596 --> 34:02.366
And that's not a good thing.

34:21.451 --> 34:24.451
<i>"How to Become a Mime
in Ten Easy Steps."</i>

34:24.453 --> 34:27.656
Hey, Twyla! I think I found
a book you might like!

34:27.658 --> 34:30.491
If it's about mimes,
you're not funny.

34:56.585 --> 34:58.455
Oh, baby.

34:59.856 --> 35:02.390
<i>"The Single Man's
Buttocks Work Out."</i>

35:02.392 --> 35:04.995
"Have a great butt in 90 days."

35:18.107 --> 35:20.040
<i>"The Super Duper
World of Adventure."</i>

35:20.042 --> 35:22.042
Hey, Jack!

35:22.044 --> 35:26.113
Jack, I've got something here about
<i>Super Duper World of Adventure.</i>

35:26.115 --> 35:27.549
Is that it?

35:27.551 --> 35:29.620
Yeah, that's the book!
Nice job!

35:38.060 --> 35:41.895
Oh, no, that's bad.
That's very bad.

35:41.897 --> 35:43.698
Call them, call them.
That's a good idea.

35:43.700 --> 35:46.935
Hey, guys, I think
I found the book.

35:46.937 --> 35:50.404
<i>"Single Man's
Buttocks Workout."</i>

35:50.406 --> 35:52.573
- Yeah.
- Why do you have that?

35:52.575 --> 35:54.609
No reason.

35:54.611 --> 35:56.544
Twyla, Twyla.

35:56.546 --> 35:58.479
I deleted Twyla.

35:58.481 --> 36:00.884
Quick. We go.

36:03.653 --> 36:05.919
Ooh, it's Jennifer.

36:05.921 --> 36:07.555
There's somebody
in there with you.

36:07.557 --> 36:10.591
Yeah, I know. Jack and Twyla
are in here with me.

36:10.593 --> 36:13.995
Jennifer sure is pretty,
but she's not that smart.

36:13.997 --> 36:15.662
I know, you monkey, OK?

36:15.664 --> 36:17.567
There are two guys,
I just saw them in the window.

36:19.468 --> 36:22.470
You'll have to call her back.

36:22.472 --> 36:23.904
Hello, kiddies.

36:23.906 --> 36:27.642
- The book, please.
- Uh, who are you?

36:27.644 --> 36:29.477
Never mind who we are.

36:29.479 --> 36:32.649
The important thing
is what we want.

36:34.084 --> 36:37.455
The book. Now.

36:39.522 --> 36:43.491
You. Little goth girl.

36:43.493 --> 36:44.993
I love your whole look,
by the way.

36:44.995 --> 36:47.529
Thank you. No one ever
compliments my style.

36:47.531 --> 36:49.533
Oh, it's exquisite.

36:50.767 --> 36:53.667
Pleasantries are concluded.

36:53.669 --> 36:56.638
The book. Now.

36:56.640 --> 36:57.942
Not a chance!

36:59.008 --> 37:01.176
Show them we mean business.

37:01.178 --> 37:03.044
You got it, Gunther.

37:03.046 --> 37:06.046
Please don't hurt me,
I bruise easily.

37:06.048 --> 37:06.948
Do it.

37:06.950 --> 37:08.816
- Do what?
- Fool.

37:08.818 --> 37:11.653
Give him a wedgie, like the
bullies probably gave you

37:11.655 --> 37:13.555
when you were a sad
little schoolboy.

37:13.557 --> 37:15.589
Sorry about this, kid.

37:15.591 --> 37:17.825
It's OK, I get
them all the time.

37:17.827 --> 37:22.229
- I'll take that.
- Good boy, Skipper. Run!

37:22.231 --> 37:25.700
You handle the kids,
I'll get the dog!

37:25.702 --> 37:28.705
Got it! Come here!

37:32.242 --> 37:34.709
Who turned out the lights?!

37:34.711 --> 37:37.212
The lights are out
and I'm scared.

37:37.214 --> 37:40.584
Gunther? Gunther?
Where are you?

37:55.698 --> 37:59.767
Gunther?
I'm gonna get you kids!

37:59.769 --> 38:02.236
Meddling little...
I got you.

38:02.238 --> 38:05.272
I can hear you out there.
Hiyah!

38:05.274 --> 38:08.575
Come on, you wanna fight?
Let's go!

38:08.577 --> 38:09.843
I've got you now!

38:09.845 --> 38:11.848
Aawaaaah!

38:24.026 --> 38:26.261
You puny-brained
little animal!

38:26.263 --> 38:29.129
Puny brained? Who are you
callin' puny-brained?

38:30.566 --> 38:31.899
You are trapped.

38:31.901 --> 38:36.270
And this is why you are on
the bottom of the food chain

38:36.272 --> 38:39.607
and I am on the top.

38:39.609 --> 38:42.142
Yeah, yeah.
Top of the food chain.

38:42.144 --> 38:45.779
Gunther!
Gunther, help me!

38:45.781 --> 38:48.249
Whoa, what was that?
That was one of them kids.

38:48.251 --> 38:50.651
I got you now!
Higaah!

38:50.653 --> 38:52.620
Woooah! Yah!

38:52.622 --> 38:53.955
I smell kids.

38:57.093 --> 39:00.093
- I got you.
- The book, please.

39:01.631 --> 39:04.131
Oh, are you sad? Huh?

39:04.133 --> 39:06.100
Boo hoo, I lost.

39:06.102 --> 39:08.269
Oh, this
is so humiliating.

39:08.271 --> 39:11.104
- The book.
- Oh, OK.

39:11.106 --> 39:13.176
I give up. You win.

39:15.010 --> 39:17.812
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

39:20.749 --> 39:22.716
The day is ours, Ronnie!

39:22.718 --> 39:26.620
I have liberated the book
from that puny-brained animal!

39:26.622 --> 39:28.723
Where's the German guy?
He has the book.

39:28.725 --> 39:30.658
I got it right here.

39:30.660 --> 39:32.292
I switched the books.

39:32.294 --> 39:36.029
Ha! I got you now, you kids!

39:36.031 --> 39:37.832
Aaaah!

39:49.111 --> 39:52.950
What happened?
That was a lot of stairs.

39:54.149 --> 39:56.049
Ronnie!

39:56.051 --> 39:58.720
What have they done to you?

39:58.722 --> 40:01.955
It's OK, buddy.
I have the book!

40:01.957 --> 40:03.191
Ha.

40:03.193 --> 40:06.995
<i>"Single Man's
Buttocks Workouts!"</i>

40:06.997 --> 40:11.135
Why would Grandpops read this
to a little boy?

40:12.801 --> 40:15.303
I've been outsmarted
by a canine!

40:15.305 --> 40:17.671
Haha!
You got that right!

40:19.908 --> 40:21.308
It doesn't taste like schnitzel.

40:22.778 --> 40:25.178
OK, kids.
Hold it right there.

40:25.180 --> 40:26.680
Hello, officer!

40:26.682 --> 40:31.051
OK, if anyone asks
I'm Fido McSniffy.

40:34.356 --> 40:35.990
- Ronnie!
- Gunther!

40:35.992 --> 40:39.259
What happened? My head is
swollen and I can't see!

40:39.261 --> 40:41.095
Shh!
The cops have showed up.

40:41.097 --> 40:42.897
The kids must have
triggered the alarm.

40:42.899 --> 40:45.265
I can't go back to prison.
You can't let them take me!

40:46.102 --> 40:48.903
Oh! Oh, oh, I hit
the mother country!

40:48.905 --> 40:49.904
I'm so sorry, Germany!

40:49.906 --> 40:52.240
Yes, ah, Berlin.

40:52.242 --> 40:55.910
Come on! We must go!
Come on.

40:55.912 --> 40:58.879
Stupid dog. My hind quarters
are in a great deal of pain.

41:01.251 --> 41:02.383
No!

41:03.919 --> 41:06.220
No. This way. Come on.

41:06.222 --> 41:08.455
Come on, grab my jacket.

41:08.457 --> 41:11.361
Follow me.
Like a conga line.

41:13.763 --> 41:16.397
What is that?
What is she holding?

41:16.399 --> 41:21.836
That, my friend, is an M387
World War I 37mm shell case.

41:21.838 --> 41:24.805
Also known as the
pom pom in France.

41:24.807 --> 41:26.073
The problem is it's
covered in grease.

41:26.075 --> 41:27.241
That thing is filthy!

41:27.243 --> 41:28.910
It was
discovered in Greece?

41:28.912 --> 41:30.310
No, not Greece.

41:30.312 --> 41:32.846
France. Weren't you listening?

41:32.848 --> 41:34.115
- Yeah, look, there you go.
- What were you thinking?

41:34.117 --> 41:36.783
There's the grease. See?
It's all over her hands.

41:36.785 --> 41:38.953
- Um.
- Um?

41:38.955 --> 41:40.921
That's all you have
to say for yourself?

41:40.923 --> 41:43.790
But Mom, if we find Grandpop's
treasure, we'll be fine.

41:43.792 --> 41:46.828
We won't ever have
to worry again.

41:46.830 --> 41:49.863
Wait, wait.
I'm the new kid here.

41:49.865 --> 41:52.232
Uh, but are you guys seriously
looking for treasure?

41:52.234 --> 41:54.968
Yes.
Seriously.

41:54.970 --> 41:57.939
Like when we were kids
and we used to play pirates?

41:57.941 --> 41:59.973
No. Real treasure.

41:59.975 --> 42:02.310
- What's going on?
- Jack and the kids broke into the store,

42:02.312 --> 42:03.944
got busted by the 5-0.

42:03.946 --> 42:06.180
- I'm bored already.
- Ugh, cats.

42:06.182 --> 42:10.183
OK, Jack. I hate to have to
tell you this but

42:10.185 --> 42:13.921
your grandfather was a
little on the crazy side.

42:13.923 --> 42:16.292
But why would he go
to all the trouble to...

42:18.827 --> 42:19.826
To hide the...

42:21.531 --> 42:26.968
Look, sometimes lonely old
people do nutty things.

42:29.205 --> 42:31.805
This is hardly a
laughing matter, Jack.

42:33.376 --> 42:35.942
Uh, Kim, you got a little something
just underneath your, uh,

42:35.944 --> 42:37.377
just above your lip there.

42:37.379 --> 42:41.015
- What am I gonna do with you?
- But Mom, this is our chance.

42:41.017 --> 42:42.283
Stop laughing!

42:42.285 --> 42:44.384
We could get enough money
to move back to the city

42:44.386 --> 42:47.455
and leave this stupid town!

42:47.457 --> 42:50.227
Oh, no you didn't.

42:51.160 --> 42:52.959
Stupid town?

42:52.961 --> 42:55.162
Wait, Twyla, I didn't
mean it that way.

42:55.164 --> 42:56.497
Whatever.

42:56.499 --> 42:59.133
Come on, Fred.
Let's go home.

42:59.135 --> 43:00.234
Do you need a ride home?

43:00.236 --> 43:01.868
We can walk.

43:01.870 --> 43:02.904
Come on, Fred.

43:02.906 --> 43:07.174
It was nice talking on
the phone earlier, Jennifer.

43:07.176 --> 43:08.912
Ugh.

43:10.914 --> 43:14.881
Young lady, will you
please hold onto this for me?

43:14.883 --> 43:15.616
Yes, ma'am.

43:15.618 --> 43:18.419
And no matter
how much Jack begs

43:18.421 --> 43:19.886
do not give that back to him.

43:19.888 --> 43:22.957
I am tired of all this
treasure nonsense.

43:22.959 --> 43:25.359
- But Mom...
- Enough, Jack.

43:25.361 --> 43:29.900
I'll deal with you once
you've walked Jennifer home.

43:31.434 --> 43:32.933
Ugh, I can't look.

43:32.935 --> 43:35.035
Does she still have that
stuff all over her face?

43:35.037 --> 43:37.340
Yes. Yeah, she does.

43:39.508 --> 43:41.408
I hope you're proud, Ronnie.

43:41.410 --> 43:46.214
Bested by a small dog
and a cheap globe.

43:46.216 --> 43:48.381
Oh, yeah?
Well, at least I'm not the one

43:48.383 --> 43:51.118
that lost a game of
keep away to three kids.

43:51.120 --> 43:53.421
I would have
triumphed in keep away

43:53.423 --> 43:57.558
if I had not had to babysit a
jabbering nincompoop like you.

43:57.560 --> 44:00.227
I don't even know why you
were hired to assist me

44:00.229 --> 44:02.462
on this endeavor
in the first place.

44:02.464 --> 44:05.433
Well, neither do I.
I just got a call out of nowhere

44:05.435 --> 44:08.602
to go help this
weird German guy.

44:08.604 --> 44:10.904
You dare call me weird?

44:10.906 --> 44:12.640
You are a mindless worm crawling

44:12.642 --> 44:15.977
in the primordial
slime compared to me.

44:15.979 --> 44:19.980
And why must we reside
in this shoddy pup tent?

44:19.982 --> 44:22.917
We're on a covert
mission, Gunther.

44:22.919 --> 44:26.120
The tent is the best way to
hide without being detected.

44:27.089 --> 44:28.488
That must be our pizza.

44:28.490 --> 44:32.896
- You got thin crust, right?
- Of course. I'm not a savage.

44:40.035 --> 44:42.271
- Mama!
- Gunther.

44:47.510 --> 44:52.482
- Oh, and you must be Ronnie.
- That's me, I'm Ronnie.

44:54.149 --> 44:58.685
- Come to me, Ronnie!
- Uh, ok.

44:58.687 --> 45:01.589
- Mmmm.
- Okay, alright.

45:01.591 --> 45:04.258
- Yeah, uh-huh.
- Do you know who I am?

45:04.260 --> 45:07.694
Uh, the lady what
hired me for this job?

45:07.696 --> 45:11.968
Ya!
And I am also your mother.

45:12.702 --> 45:14.368
- What?!
- Ya.

45:14.370 --> 45:18.104
Gunther, this is your
American step-brother.

45:18.106 --> 45:20.006
From when I lived in New Jersey.

45:20.008 --> 45:24.645
I had to give him up for adoption
when I had to flee the country.

45:24.647 --> 45:30.017
The FBI, the CIA, and Walmart
security were after me.

45:30.019 --> 45:32.185
- I had to run.
- Well, yeah.

46:17.367 --> 46:19.734
My brother!

46:19.736 --> 46:22.169
OK, yeah.

46:24.740 --> 46:26.240
Wow.

46:26.242 --> 46:28.412
This is a lot to process.

46:31.180 --> 46:33.279
Come here, bro!

46:33.281 --> 46:38.120
Oh, it's so much fun!
I can see my house.

46:41.723 --> 46:43.457
Could you at least
let me look at the book

46:43.459 --> 46:45.258
until we get back to your place?

46:45.260 --> 46:46.459
I'm not crossing your mom.

46:46.461 --> 46:50.633
If she told my parents
what I did I'll be dead.

46:53.102 --> 46:56.470
So what happened
to you and Twyla?

46:56.472 --> 46:58.439
You used to be best friends.

46:58.441 --> 47:00.808
Yeah, when we were little.

47:00.810 --> 47:02.542
And then I got into
clothes and make-up

47:02.544 --> 47:05.645
and she got into weird
clothes and freaky make-up.

47:05.647 --> 47:08.182
But you used to have
so much in common,

47:08.184 --> 47:11.819
like pretending to be
pirates and the art of mime.

47:11.821 --> 47:14.321
Shut up. She did not show you
that video, did she?

47:14.323 --> 47:17.124
Your stuck in a box
trick was amazing.

47:17.126 --> 47:19.160
Really. It moved me.

47:19.162 --> 47:21.595
Yeah, we thought we were
gonna be world famous mimes.

47:21.597 --> 47:23.499
Doesn't every kid?

47:29.104 --> 47:31.738
So, what about you?

47:31.740 --> 47:34.140
You really think you're gonna
find some old Spanish treasure

47:34.142 --> 47:36.243
hidden by your grandpappy?

47:36.245 --> 47:40.147
It's Grandpops, and yes, I do.

47:40.149 --> 47:42.183
Well, you know that's
impossible, right?

47:42.185 --> 47:45.319
No, it's not. Why do you think
those guys came after us?

47:45.321 --> 47:48.689
Um, ever heard
of security guards?

47:48.691 --> 47:53.326
You know what your problem is?
You have no imagination.

47:53.328 --> 47:54.160
Whatever.

47:54.162 --> 47:56.430
You only care about
hair and clothes.

47:56.432 --> 47:58.765
And that's it.
And that's boring.

47:58.767 --> 48:01.134
Yeah? Well at least
I'm not delusional.

48:01.136 --> 48:02.703
Well, at least my best
friend isn't make-up.

48:02.705 --> 48:04.205
Well, at least my
best friend isn't a dog!

48:04.207 --> 48:07.308
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah!

48:07.310 --> 48:11.479
Well, at least I'm
not a terrible mime!

48:11.481 --> 48:16.649
Grandpops Cragmore hid that
treasure from me for 30 years.

48:16.651 --> 48:21.187
Once he passed away...
Not now, sweetie.

48:21.189 --> 48:25.725
...and I found his obituary
online, I knew where to look.

48:25.727 --> 48:28.229
Tell me, did you find the box?

48:28.231 --> 48:29.897
No, but his grandkid did.

48:29.899 --> 48:32.500
There was a movie
in it with a clue! A book!

48:32.502 --> 48:35.269
- Did you obtain the book?
- No.

48:35.271 --> 48:37.904
That sniveling cretin
of a boy has it!

48:37.906 --> 48:40.241
We shall get that book, mama.

48:40.243 --> 48:43.343
I will start a campaign
of surveillance,

48:43.345 --> 48:46.379
infiltration, and extraction,
and steal that book right from

48:46.381 --> 48:49.350
under that boy's
snotty little nose!

48:49.352 --> 48:51.317
<i>Nein, nein.</i>
There's a better way.

48:51.319 --> 48:53.319
Yeah, Ma's got a better way.

48:53.321 --> 48:55.421
Wait, you're
calling her Ma now?

48:55.423 --> 48:58.392
What?
I call you bro.

48:58.394 --> 48:59.259
Bro.

49:00.030 --> 49:02.662
I cannot believe
I have a brother!

49:06.202 --> 49:08.537
Shut up, dummkopfs.
Let me think.

49:16.946 --> 49:18.779
- You got anything?
- Ma?

49:18.781 --> 49:20.446
- How about now?
- Anything?

49:20.448 --> 49:22.415
- How about now?
- Now?

49:22.417 --> 49:25.285
How about now?
You want a thinking marshmallow?

49:25.287 --> 49:27.590
- Not now, sweetie.
- Ow.

49:41.870 --> 49:44.441
Fred? Fred?

49:45.874 --> 49:47.473
Hey, Fred.

49:47.475 --> 49:49.310
Are you actually
talking to me?

49:49.312 --> 49:51.412
Yeah, you're the
only Fred around here.

49:51.414 --> 49:54.281
Well, Fred Bellson's
over there.

49:55.584 --> 49:57.417
What I meant to say was,
why are you talking to me?

49:57.419 --> 50:00.720
- You hate me.
- OK, I don't hate you, Fred.

50:00.722 --> 50:03.723
I just, I have cool friends
who rag on me when I,

50:03.725 --> 50:05.794
- you know, talk to...
- Nerds?

50:06.928 --> 50:09.330
Yeah, like my old friends.

50:09.332 --> 50:10.663
Anyway, I'm trying
to get a hold of Jack

50:10.665 --> 50:11.999
but I don't think he'll
talk to me anymore

50:12.001 --> 50:14.468
and I don't even know how
to approach Twyla, so...

50:14.470 --> 50:15.636
What's up?

50:15.638 --> 50:18.272
OK, remember that book that you
guys stole from the store?

50:18.274 --> 50:19.740
Oh, you kept it.
That's amazing!

50:19.742 --> 50:20.975
- That's great...
- No, I didn't.

50:20.977 --> 50:23.276
I returned it to the store.
I'm a good person.

50:23.278 --> 50:25.912
Oh, man.
This dream's totally over.

50:25.914 --> 50:28.448
We could have saved the
whole town with that book.

50:28.450 --> 50:31.451
- Really?
- That's what Twyla and I were hoping.

50:31.453 --> 50:33.287
I'm not so sure
about Jack, though.

50:33.289 --> 50:34.988
Well, I was looking
through it last night.

50:34.990 --> 50:36.959
I noticed something.

50:39.861 --> 50:41.363
See?

50:44.700 --> 50:46.937
- Let's go tell the others.
- OK.

50:47.937 --> 50:49.970
Hey, what about me?

50:49.972 --> 50:52.508
- Not you!
- Oh.

51:08.790 --> 51:10.457
Jack?

51:10.459 --> 51:11.991
You down here?

51:11.993 --> 51:14.962
What're you guys doing here?

51:14.964 --> 51:17.367
I wish I knew.

51:21.803 --> 51:24.504
OK, you guys need to see this.

51:24.506 --> 51:26.372
Jennifer found
something in that book.

51:26.374 --> 51:28.375
- What, fashion tips?
- Ooh.

51:28.377 --> 51:29.642
Oh, shut up,
mistress of the dark.

51:29.644 --> 51:31.678
- Oh, that's a burn.
- At least I'm not an illiterate princess.

51:31.680 --> 51:34.381
- Oh, that's a double burn!
- Why are you such a jerk?

51:34.383 --> 51:35.683
Burnfest!

51:35.685 --> 51:36.517
- Why are you such an airhead?
- Scorched.

51:36.519 --> 51:39.553
OK, forget it.
This was a stupid idea.

51:39.555 --> 51:41.921
Wait, wait, wait.
You came all this way.

51:41.923 --> 51:43.490
What did you find?

51:46.595 --> 51:50.363
OK. So I was looking through
the book that you guys stole

51:50.365 --> 51:53.566
and there are a few words
highlighted throughout the pages.

51:53.568 --> 51:55.069
We knew that.

51:55.071 --> 51:58.375
OK, well did you
know what words?

52:00.475 --> 52:04.477
"Hurry the heed,
bell and seat, to your."

52:04.479 --> 52:07.747
Wow. Hurry the heed,
bell and seat, to your.

52:07.749 --> 52:09.549
Jennifer, you cracked it!

52:10.685 --> 52:13.453
Oh. Wait.

52:13.455 --> 52:16.423
No, you didn't.

52:16.425 --> 52:19.396
OK, well I just thought you guys
might know what it means.

52:20.595 --> 52:21.964
Can I see that?

52:26.135 --> 52:29.470
Wait a second.
Wait a second.

52:29.472 --> 52:31.805
If you scramble
the words it says,

52:31.807 --> 52:34.073
"Heed the bell and
hurry to your seat."

52:34.075 --> 52:36.075
It probably means
something about school.

52:36.077 --> 52:39.078
And everybody told me
dyslexia was a bad thing.

52:39.080 --> 52:40.783
Sure worked here.

52:42.952 --> 52:45.486
- What?
- Fred, you're a genius!

52:45.488 --> 52:47.453
You solved it.
Now let's go find the treasure.

52:47.455 --> 52:50.591
Sorry, no. I'm not
breaking into some school

52:50.593 --> 52:52.493
just so Jack here
can strike it rich.

52:52.495 --> 52:55.095
Um, I thought that we were
trying to save the town.

52:55.097 --> 52:59.636
We were.
Jack is trying to leave town.

53:08.144 --> 53:12.515
I'd help but
Twyla's my friend. Sorry.

53:15.017 --> 53:16.649
At least I still
have you, Skipper.

53:16.651 --> 53:21.090
Uh, I need to return some
books to the video store.

53:26.194 --> 53:29.763
So these are the
schools in the area.

53:29.765 --> 53:31.768
Which one is it?

53:36.839 --> 53:40.207
He knows we're watching
and he's waiting.

53:40.209 --> 53:42.542
He's a crafty little devil.

53:42.544 --> 53:46.482
Ah-hah!
He's playing the waiting game!

53:49.051 --> 53:52.785
What is the waiting game?

53:52.787 --> 53:54.854
You know, where he
waits for us to give up

53:54.856 --> 53:57.957
and then he goes in
and gets the treasure.

53:57.959 --> 53:59.493
But we're not giving up!

53:59.495 --> 54:02.562
Don't give our position away!

54:02.564 --> 54:05.665
We must move soon.
No more spying.

54:05.667 --> 54:08.669
- We must take action.
- Yeah!

54:08.671 --> 54:11.705
Thankfully, I have a plan.

54:11.707 --> 54:13.973
No more waiting
game for us, hey, Mama?

54:16.578 --> 54:19.245
Stop that, you're scaring me!

54:19.247 --> 54:21.515
Jack.
Jack, you gotta come upstairs.

54:21.517 --> 54:23.183
Your mom seems pretty upset.

54:23.185 --> 54:25.986
Jack? Hello?
Here, I'll sit for ya.

54:25.988 --> 54:29.890
Jack. Hey, buddy.
Jack? Your mom.

54:29.892 --> 54:31.158
Will you come upstairs with me?

54:31.160 --> 54:36.729
Jack? Oh, right. I'm a dog.
I keep forgetting.

54:39.734 --> 54:40.901
What is it, Skipper?

54:42.037 --> 54:43.506
What is it, boy?

54:53.649 --> 54:57.216
- Mom?
- Hey, bud.

54:57.218 --> 55:00.189
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

55:01.723 --> 55:04.057
You're crying.

55:04.059 --> 55:06.627
I'm not crying,
don't be silly.

55:10.598 --> 55:13.633
I um...

55:13.635 --> 55:17.806
I thought this place would be
a new start for us, you know?

55:19.807 --> 55:23.676
I was a fool to give up
everything for this place.

55:23.678 --> 55:24.912
It's OK, Mom.

55:24.914 --> 55:26.712
It doesn't matter
where we wind up.

55:26.714 --> 55:30.252
As long as we're together,
we're home.

55:31.653 --> 55:32.754
Come here.

55:35.223 --> 55:36.758
Thank you.

55:41.964 --> 55:44.830
What if there was a way for
us to pay for fixing the town

55:44.832 --> 55:46.933
so that we could stay here?

55:46.935 --> 55:49.336
That would take a miracle.

55:49.338 --> 55:53.607
- Or Spanish treasure.
- Not that again, Jack.

55:53.609 --> 55:56.075
Let me try to find it. You said
yourself it's safe here.

55:56.077 --> 55:58.814
So at least let me try, please?

56:00.915 --> 56:02.749
- Alright.
- Yes!

56:02.751 --> 56:06.089
But no breaking
and entering, OK?

56:13.796 --> 56:15.598
What is that smell?

56:18.300 --> 56:21.167
I think I smell steak.

56:21.169 --> 56:24.337
That's impossible.
It's the middle of the night.

56:24.339 --> 56:27.374
Oh, man, that sure smells
like steak, though.

56:27.376 --> 56:30.877
That's impossible. Steaks don't
appear out of no... Oh, oh!

56:30.879 --> 56:32.115
Jackpot!

56:34.850 --> 56:36.283
Eat it, doggie.

56:36.285 --> 56:38.986
A steak magically
appearing in the back yard.

56:38.988 --> 56:41.053
That's never happened before.

56:41.055 --> 56:43.390
It's a delicious steak.

56:43.392 --> 56:45.024
Oh, this is too
good to be true.

56:45.026 --> 56:46.692
I'm not eating that.

56:48.363 --> 56:51.397
Then again, free steak.

56:55.037 --> 56:56.837
Eat it!

56:56.839 --> 56:57.872
What's wrong with this thing?

56:57.874 --> 57:00.874
I don't know! This is every
dog's dream come true!

57:00.876 --> 57:03.776
I'd have to be stupid to eat
that. There is no way someone

57:03.778 --> 57:06.846
would just throw a perfectly
good steak in the back yard.

57:06.848 --> 57:07.982
It's gotta be a trick.

57:07.984 --> 57:10.783
Do you think he knows it's
stuffed full of tranquilizers?

57:10.785 --> 57:13.787
It's probably stuffed
full of tranquilizers.

57:13.789 --> 57:17.723
No! No.
He's just a stupid dog.

57:17.725 --> 57:21.861
Nitwit animal won't comply with
Mama's scheme to sedate him.

57:22.897 --> 57:24.263
Let's just grab him!

57:24.265 --> 57:26.899
Ooh, random back yard steak.

57:26.901 --> 57:28.334
It's all my dreams coming true.

57:28.336 --> 57:29.870
Chauncey,
I would not eat that.

57:29.872 --> 57:32.372
- I think it's a trick.
- Yeah, sure it is.

57:32.374 --> 57:37.810
- You snoozed, you losed.
- OK, fine. Knock yourself out.

57:37.812 --> 57:40.881
Never send a boy
to do a man's job.

57:40.883 --> 57:41.615
Stay here.

57:41.617 --> 57:43.183
You keep eating that,
Chauncey.

57:43.185 --> 57:46.019
I'll take care of those two
guys behind the barrels.

57:46.021 --> 57:48.758
- I believe in you.
- Thank you.

57:51.459 --> 57:53.392
- I got it!
- Yes!

57:53.394 --> 57:57.129
I got him, I got him,
I got him, I got him.

57:57.131 --> 57:59.466
Very good, brother!

57:59.468 --> 58:01.468
You have a real talent
for the dognapping.

58:01.470 --> 58:03.270
Well, I was a
dog-catcher in Jersey.

58:03.272 --> 58:07.473
- One of the best in town.
- It makes sense.

58:07.475 --> 58:10.276
Uh-huh.
Great job, guys.

58:10.278 --> 58:15.048
You've caught <i>ein</i> kitty!
You're a kitty-napper!

58:15.050 --> 58:16.950
You know, you've been a
lot nicer to me ever since

58:16.952 --> 58:18.919
we found out we were brothers.

58:18.921 --> 58:21.220
Well, of course, bro.

58:23.057 --> 58:25.792
Oh, I got a great idea.
This is gonna be good.

58:25.794 --> 58:27.961
This is gonna be so great.

58:27.963 --> 58:29.930
These guys are
gonna be in for it.

58:29.932 --> 58:33.100
We need to find that dog.

58:33.102 --> 58:36.435
Whaddya got?
Whaddya got, Gunther?

58:36.437 --> 58:40.339
- Not now, I'm thinking.
- Whaddya got?

58:40.341 --> 58:44.944
Just gonna wedge
this down there. OK.

58:44.946 --> 58:47.881
Here we go.

58:47.883 --> 58:49.883
Turn this on here.

58:49.885 --> 58:54.089
And that should do it.

58:55.289 --> 58:56.823
Uh...

58:56.825 --> 58:59.258
- Gunther?
- I said not now!

58:59.260 --> 59:02.464
Uh, yeah, but Gunther,
your pants.

59:03.899 --> 59:06.899
- Gunther?
- What?

59:06.901 --> 59:08.167
Your pants.

59:14.977 --> 59:16.112
Uh...

59:17.011 --> 59:18.280
Nice undies.

59:20.481 --> 59:22.816
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

59:24.318 --> 59:27.222
Uh-oh.
Oh, what the heck!

59:29.357 --> 59:33.826
And that is why you never
send a boy to do a man's job.

59:33.828 --> 59:37.300
Hey, man,
get me outta here!

59:39.001 --> 59:42.305
Skipper? Skipper!

59:52.580 --> 59:55.048
"If
you want to see your dog alive again

59:55.050 --> 59:58.151
you will find the treasure
and give it to us.

59:58.153 --> 01:00:01.587
Once you have it, await
further instruction."

01:00:01.589 --> 01:00:04.024
How will they
know if we have it?

01:00:04.026 --> 01:00:06.026
Do you think
they're watching us?

01:00:06.028 --> 01:00:07.060
Huh?

01:00:07.062 --> 01:00:08.428
What are those kids doing?

01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:09.895
They're sitting!

01:00:09.897 --> 01:00:13.899
And, and... they're talking!

01:00:13.901 --> 01:00:17.069
- So can you guys help me?
- You need to call the police.

01:00:17.071 --> 01:00:19.272
But if we call the police,
they'll take the treasure.

01:00:19.274 --> 01:00:22.075
Remember what Grandpops said?
Grown-ups are greedy.

01:00:22.077 --> 01:00:23.977
Yeah, like these dog-nappers.

01:00:23.979 --> 01:00:26.212
You know, I bet it's the school
they closed down years ago.

01:00:26.214 --> 01:00:27.379
I probably have a key for it.

01:00:27.381 --> 01:00:29.448
My mom has the
key to everything.

01:00:29.450 --> 01:00:33.386
- Which one is it?
- Um, I think it's this one.

01:00:33.388 --> 01:00:34.620
Let me see!

01:00:37.292 --> 01:00:40.459
How did these three
buffoons capture me?

01:00:40.461 --> 01:00:41.962
Let me see!

01:00:44.566 --> 01:00:48.067
- Oh.
- Give them back!

01:00:48.069 --> 01:00:49.236
Give them back.

01:00:51.039 --> 01:00:55.241
There. Yeah. I see.

01:00:55.243 --> 01:00:58.111
Look, I'm sorry for what
I said about the town.

01:00:58.113 --> 01:01:00.946
I never asked to move here
and I was mad about it

01:01:00.948 --> 01:01:03.116
but now that you
guys are my friends,

01:01:03.118 --> 01:01:06.252
at least I hope you're
my friends, I wanna stay.

01:01:06.254 --> 01:01:08.988
Well, how can you if these
creeps get the treasure?

01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:11.457
Well, I'm not gonna go to
all that trouble to find it

01:01:11.459 --> 01:01:13.158
and then just hand it
over to them.

01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:16.428
- Do you have a plan?
- No, I'm making it up as I go.

01:01:16.430 --> 01:01:20.135
That doesn't exactly
inspire confidence.

01:01:21.236 --> 01:01:23.035
But I'll still help you.

01:01:23.037 --> 01:01:25.073
- Yeah.
- Let's help.

01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:30.009
They're leaving!

01:01:30.011 --> 01:01:32.044
The game is afoot.

01:01:35.984 --> 01:01:40.419
Don't do the evil laugh.
You sound like a psycho.

01:01:40.421 --> 01:01:42.425
You really think so?

01:01:51.165 --> 01:01:55.968
That's right, kids.
Lead us right to the treasure!

01:01:55.970 --> 01:01:58.604
Faster.

01:01:58.606 --> 01:02:02.008
Mama, we can't go any faster.
We'll pass them.

01:02:02.010 --> 01:02:04.080
- Good point.
- Details.

01:02:24.131 --> 01:02:25.464
This place is creepy.

01:02:25.466 --> 01:02:27.066
It's a lot creepier
with teachers.

01:02:27.068 --> 01:02:29.468
How long ago did
they close this place?

01:02:29.470 --> 01:02:32.205
Before we started
going to school.

01:02:32.207 --> 01:02:35.075
Well, where should we look?

01:02:35.077 --> 01:02:39.044
Well, the clue said heed the
bell and hurry to your seat

01:02:39.046 --> 01:02:41.080
so I think we should
check a classroom.

01:02:41.082 --> 01:02:43.350
Fred?
What're you doing?

01:02:43.352 --> 01:02:46.086
No treasure in here.

01:02:46.088 --> 01:02:50.089
If there were only
some kind of clue.

01:02:50.091 --> 01:02:54.095
Wait a sec.
Let's follow the arrow.

01:02:55.062 --> 01:02:56.331
Hm.

01:03:04.138 --> 01:03:06.538
Gunther, watch <i>mein</i> heel.

01:03:06.540 --> 01:03:08.540
OK.

01:03:08.542 --> 01:03:10.343
Don't worry, Mama.

01:03:10.345 --> 01:03:12.013
We'll get it all.

01:03:17.551 --> 01:03:20.522
Remember the plan.

01:03:21.390 --> 01:03:24.057
Right! Get the clue.

01:03:34.236 --> 01:03:37.707
Heed the bell
and hurry to your seat.

01:03:44.745 --> 01:03:47.413
Well, I'm in my seat.
Now what?

01:03:47.415 --> 01:03:51.453
Maybe someone
else got to it first.

01:03:57.158 --> 01:03:58.825
I hope, for your sake,

01:03:58.827 --> 01:04:03.296
the last moments of your life
aren't spent in this box.

01:04:03.298 --> 01:04:04.798
You need a mint.

01:04:06.734 --> 01:04:08.667
I think Twyla was right.

01:04:08.669 --> 01:04:10.303
Nothing here.

01:04:10.305 --> 01:04:12.138
Maybe it's in this envelope.

01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:15.077
- It's got your name on it.
- Let me see!

01:04:17.312 --> 01:04:20.580
"Go to the home
of the clapping hands?"

01:04:20.582 --> 01:04:22.118
Ah-hah!

01:04:22.617 --> 01:04:25.218
We followed you!

01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:28.821
Once again the adults
outsmart the children.

01:04:28.823 --> 01:04:31.691
Yeah, real smart, pal.
Now where's my dog?

01:04:31.693 --> 01:04:34.194
Oh, you're never
gonna find him,

01:04:34.196 --> 01:04:37.497
'cause we got him locked
in the trunk of our car!

01:04:38.533 --> 01:04:40.834
- Really?
- I am so sorry.

01:04:40.836 --> 01:04:43.372
- That one's on me.
- Yeah.

01:04:50.211 --> 01:04:55.647
I'm running out of
patience with you, young man.

01:04:55.649 --> 01:04:57.883
- Where is it?
- There's nothing here.

01:04:57.885 --> 01:05:00.386
All we found was another clue.

01:05:00.388 --> 01:05:02.158
Give it to me.

01:05:04.191 --> 01:05:05.527
Run!

01:05:06.461 --> 01:05:07.796
After them!

01:05:08.696 --> 01:05:10.231
Go!

01:05:12.633 --> 01:05:16.336
Looks like your friends
have abandoned you.

01:05:16.338 --> 01:05:19.274
Oh, boo-hoo. I'm so sad.

01:05:21.243 --> 01:05:24.243
You don't scare me.
I could take you.

01:05:24.245 --> 01:05:26.678
You want to fight me?

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:28.413
I don't fight with children.

01:05:28.415 --> 01:05:30.350
Chicken.

01:05:30.352 --> 01:05:32.584
No, thank you. I've already
had a complete breakfast.

01:05:32.586 --> 01:05:38.290
- I am full.
- No, I'm calling you a chicken.

01:05:38.292 --> 01:05:40.392
In my homeland
that is a compli...

01:05:40.394 --> 01:05:42.395
My nose!

01:05:46.368 --> 01:05:49.234
Ahh! Ohh.

01:05:49.236 --> 01:05:54.674
Ah, you think you can pummel me
into submission with those balls?

01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:57.442
Think again.

01:05:57.444 --> 01:06:02.881
I am captain of the German
National Dodgeball team.

01:06:02.883 --> 01:06:05.884
Three time world champion!

01:06:05.886 --> 01:06:08.421
If dodgeball was
an Olympic event

01:06:08.423 --> 01:06:10.957
I'd have like three gold meda...

01:06:12.359 --> 01:06:13.892
No! No!

01:06:16.330 --> 01:06:18.434
No! Oh!

01:06:23.939 --> 01:06:25.437
Look, I've been thinking

01:06:25.439 --> 01:06:28.274
and I'm sorry I've been
so stuck up lately, Twyla.

01:06:28.276 --> 01:06:29.441
What're you talking about?

01:06:29.443 --> 01:06:31.611
I'm trying to
apologize to you.

01:06:31.613 --> 01:06:32.812
Now?

01:06:32.814 --> 01:06:34.446
Well, I might not
get a chance later.

01:06:34.448 --> 01:06:37.252
- Well, I'm...
- Just go in here.

01:06:39.254 --> 01:06:40.053
I'm the one who's sorry.

01:06:40.055 --> 01:06:41.386
I was just as stuck
up as you were.

01:06:41.388 --> 01:06:42.654
It's not your fault,
you made new friends.

01:06:42.656 --> 01:06:44.357
Yeah, but I shouldn't
have let them tell me

01:06:44.359 --> 01:06:45.424
who I can be friends with.

01:06:45.426 --> 01:06:47.493
- And I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, too.

01:06:47.495 --> 01:06:49.962
And by the way, I think
you look really cool.

01:06:49.964 --> 01:06:52.464
Thank you.
And you dress really nice, too.

01:06:52.466 --> 01:06:55.435
- I know.
- See, that is so nice.

01:06:55.437 --> 01:06:57.470
You know, I just
reconnected with my brother

01:06:57.472 --> 01:07:01.406
so I know exactly what
you're going through.

01:07:03.345 --> 01:07:05.477
I was being nice!

01:07:22.830 --> 01:07:24.330
You've got nothing!

01:07:24.332 --> 01:07:25.801
What do you have?

01:07:30.372 --> 01:07:32.404
Ahhhh.

01:07:32.406 --> 01:07:34.209
Cat-like reflexes.

01:07:35.644 --> 01:07:37.979
Get that out of my house!

01:07:57.564 --> 01:07:59.334
That is enough!

01:08:00.535 --> 01:08:02.701
I got you now.

01:08:16.383 --> 01:08:18.386
No, no, no, no, no!

01:08:29.029 --> 01:08:32.399
Oh, I'm so pretty.

01:08:35.102 --> 01:08:38.737
You didn't even give me a
chance to stretch my hamstrings!

01:08:38.738 --> 01:08:41.676
Now for the creme de la creme.

01:08:46.448 --> 01:08:47.313
Marbles?

01:08:47.314 --> 01:08:50.416
You think these are
going to defeat me?

01:08:50.417 --> 01:08:52.453
You are not as smart...

01:09:04.098 --> 01:09:05.497
Are you guys OK?

01:09:05.499 --> 01:09:06.499
- We're fine.
- Are you good?

01:09:06.501 --> 01:09:09.035
Yeah. Let's get out of here, OK?
I have the clue.

01:09:09.037 --> 01:09:11.406
- OK, let's go.
- Let's go.

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:15.808
Enough!

01:09:15.810 --> 01:09:17.609
Oh, hey kids.

01:09:22.050 --> 01:09:25.084
What happened to you?
Gunther?

01:09:25.086 --> 01:09:27.620
I don't wish to talk about it.

01:09:27.622 --> 01:09:31.523
- Ronnie.
- I... I went for a little ride.

01:09:31.524 --> 01:09:34.527
Oh, those monsters.

01:09:34.529 --> 01:09:35.827
And the treasure?

01:09:35.828 --> 01:09:38.831
It turns out it
was another clue.

01:09:40.135 --> 01:09:43.769
Grandpops proves to be
a wily opponent,

01:09:43.770 --> 01:09:46.072
even from beyond the grave.

01:09:46.073 --> 01:09:47.939
Sounds like a buffoon.

01:09:49.109 --> 01:09:51.577
The game is over, kinders.

01:09:51.578 --> 01:09:55.113
The papers.
Give us the papers.

01:09:55.115 --> 01:09:58.084
- I don't have it.
- Vat?

01:09:58.086 --> 01:10:00.685
I mean, what?

01:10:00.687 --> 01:10:02.587
My accent is rubbing
off on you, bro.

01:10:05.025 --> 01:10:07.626
- I have it.
- Don't give it to her.

01:10:07.628 --> 01:10:10.796
If you want to get
your little doggie back,

01:10:10.798 --> 01:10:13.868
you will give me the papers.

01:10:24.111 --> 01:10:25.877
Skipper, are you OK, boy?

01:10:25.879 --> 01:10:28.880
Well, she smelled
a little but I'm fine.

01:10:28.882 --> 01:10:31.117
Now, we leave.

01:10:31.119 --> 01:10:32.684
Yeah.

01:10:34.521 --> 01:10:38.023
Ha, ha!
We win again, losers!

01:10:43.964 --> 01:10:45.630
We have it.

01:10:45.632 --> 01:10:47.867
- Just one second.
- I can't reach it.

01:10:47.869 --> 01:10:49.734
Can you reach it for me?

01:10:49.736 --> 01:10:51.440
Very economical!

01:10:56.077 --> 01:10:59.711
- Ha!
- Ha!

01:10:59.713 --> 01:11:01.746
To the right!
I mean left.

01:11:01.748 --> 01:11:02.747
- Are you OK, Skipper?
- Yeah, I'm fine, Jack.

01:11:02.749 --> 01:11:04.015
- Thanks.
- OK.

01:11:04.017 --> 01:11:05.718
It'll take them a while
to figure out the clue

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:07.152
so if we haul tail then
we can get there first.

01:11:07.154 --> 01:11:08.754
What was that gibberish?

01:11:08.756 --> 01:11:10.555
Go to the home of
the clapping hands?

01:11:10.557 --> 01:11:12.224
What does that even mean?

01:11:12.226 --> 01:11:13.528
Follow me.

01:11:25.940 --> 01:11:32.111
All we have to do is find this home
of the clapping hands and we're rich!

01:11:32.113 --> 01:11:36.351
- Oh, yes!
- Yeah!

01:11:40.221 --> 01:11:43.622
So where do you suppose
this place could be?

01:11:43.624 --> 01:11:46.024
Home of the clapping pants?

01:11:46.026 --> 01:11:48.960
- Hands!
- What?

01:11:48.962 --> 01:11:50.295
Hands.

01:11:50.297 --> 01:11:52.298
Your accent is
so strong, Mama.

01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:53.569
Ya.

01:12:12.654 --> 01:12:13.486
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:12:13.488 --> 01:12:15.921
I give you the home
of clapping hands.

01:12:15.923 --> 01:12:17.657
The theater!

01:12:17.659 --> 01:12:19.695
Oh, I get it. Applause.

01:12:26.266 --> 01:12:28.667
Hey, it's
pretty dark in here.

01:12:28.669 --> 01:12:30.268
Hey, guys, someone
should probably see

01:12:30.270 --> 01:12:31.336
if they can get
these lights to work.

01:12:31.338 --> 01:12:33.171
Let me see if I
can get the lights to work.

01:12:33.173 --> 01:12:36.608
Oh, thanks.
Thanks, Twyla, you're a peach.

01:12:36.610 --> 01:12:39.178
Ah, there you go.
That's better.

01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:42.113
So this must be the
home of clapping hands.

01:12:42.115 --> 01:12:45.350
Clapping hands must
mean the audience, right?

01:12:45.352 --> 01:12:48.321
So the clue must
be in the seats?

01:12:48.323 --> 01:12:50.626
- Let's spread out and find it.
- Yeah.

01:13:03.837 --> 01:13:05.004
Someone's here.

01:13:05.006 --> 01:13:08.374
The mannequin hand
factory was a bust.

01:13:08.376 --> 01:13:10.343
This is the only other place

01:13:10.345 --> 01:13:13.011
where there would
be clapping hands.

01:13:13.013 --> 01:13:16.215
What about a
flamenco dance studio?

01:13:16.217 --> 01:13:17.649
That's a good one, bro.

01:13:17.651 --> 01:13:19.988
- Hide!
- Yes, absolutely.

01:13:22.990 --> 01:13:25.791
I'll just hide back here.
They'll never spot me here.

01:13:25.793 --> 01:13:27.062
Thank you.

01:13:39.841 --> 01:13:42.875
Search the theater!

01:13:42.877 --> 01:13:48.749
And if by chance those kids
appear, you know what to do.

01:13:49.751 --> 01:13:51.884
Um...

01:13:51.886 --> 01:13:54.252
You know what to do.

01:13:54.254 --> 01:13:55.420
- Oh, oh, oh!
- Well, I...

01:13:56.690 --> 01:13:58.758
- Oh, oh, oh!
- Ya?

01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:00.725
We take the treasure from 'em!

01:14:00.727 --> 01:14:02.728
- That's right!
- Yes!

01:14:02.730 --> 01:14:04.397
Sweet, sweet Ronnie.

01:14:04.399 --> 01:14:06.165
Shh...

01:14:06.167 --> 01:14:09.104
Now, go!

01:14:12.205 --> 01:14:15.711
Pardon me.

01:14:39.199 --> 01:14:43.738
<i>"The Cameraman and the
Sneaky German Reporter Lady?"</i>

01:14:45.073 --> 01:14:46.908
Grandpops.

01:14:54.414 --> 01:14:56.782
It's Jack.

01:14:56.784 --> 01:14:58.416
- He found another clue.
- OK!

01:14:58.418 --> 01:15:01.389
Oh, someone's there!
We should hide.

01:15:17.805 --> 01:15:19.007
Hm.

01:15:23.945 --> 01:15:25.077
Ah-hah!

01:15:25.079 --> 01:15:29.849
I got you now!
Up you get.

01:15:29.851 --> 01:15:32.151
After you, ladies.

01:15:37.324 --> 01:15:40.428
To the right!
I mean left.

01:15:50.538 --> 01:15:52.708
Oh, sweet, Jack
found something.

01:16:09.390 --> 01:16:11.557
Geez, impatient much?

01:16:11.559 --> 01:16:13.829
Well, he has a point.

01:16:17.899 --> 01:16:21.369
Gunten-hello, little boy.

01:16:26.173 --> 01:16:28.840
Get on there.
Come on, right there.

01:16:30.845 --> 01:16:32.881
There's no running.
Come on.

01:16:37.517 --> 01:16:40.553
Well, well, well, young man.

01:16:40.555 --> 01:16:46.024
Looks like you have the treasure
and we have your friends.

01:16:46.026 --> 01:16:48.393
OK, these kids are in trouble.
I've gotta do something.

01:16:49.663 --> 01:16:54.366
I will give you to the count
of <i>drei</i> to give it to us.

01:16:54.368 --> 01:16:55.434
I've got to do something.

01:16:55.436 --> 01:16:57.603
Don't get excited,
don't get excited.

01:16:57.605 --> 01:16:59.337
Be calm.
Don't wanna fall asleep.

01:16:59.339 --> 01:17:03.341
<i>Eins,</i> two. <i>Drei!</i>

01:17:04.945 --> 01:17:06.347
Uh...

01:17:12.352 --> 01:17:14.355
Let my friends go.

01:17:15.989 --> 01:17:16.755
Whoa.

01:17:16.757 --> 01:17:19.959
This is so cool.

01:17:19.961 --> 01:17:21.960
Bow.

01:17:21.962 --> 01:17:23.295
Bow.

01:17:23.297 --> 01:17:24.095
Fred.

01:17:24.097 --> 01:17:27.566
I am your father.

01:17:27.568 --> 01:17:30.536
I have a very particular
set of skills.

01:17:30.538 --> 01:17:31.504
OK, enough, kid.

01:17:31.506 --> 01:17:33.304
I think you're milking
this a little too much.

01:17:33.306 --> 01:17:37.276
I won't let them go 'til
you give me the treasure!

01:17:37.278 --> 01:17:39.310
You're making a big mistake.

01:17:39.312 --> 01:17:41.045
We have your friends.

01:17:41.047 --> 01:17:44.116
This is your last warning.

01:17:44.118 --> 01:17:47.652
- Who are you to warn us?
- Yeah.

01:17:47.654 --> 01:17:51.991
OK.
Don't say I didn't warn ya.

01:17:51.993 --> 01:17:53.024
Duck!

01:17:54.028 --> 01:17:55.426
Oh, you come back!

01:17:55.428 --> 01:17:57.996
- Ronnie!
- Ronnie!

01:17:57.998 --> 01:17:59.166
Ronnie!

01:18:05.105 --> 01:18:06.307
Gunther!

01:18:14.248 --> 01:18:17.249
Oh, boy. Oh, boy, I gotta,
I gotta do something.

01:18:17.251 --> 01:18:18.250
Man, that smoke looks dangerous.

01:18:18.252 --> 01:18:22.020
My eyes!

01:18:22.022 --> 01:18:24.590
I'm coming! I'm coming!
OK, here we go!

01:18:24.592 --> 01:18:26.061
Three, two, one.

01:18:31.464 --> 01:18:32.965
Are you guys OK?

01:18:32.967 --> 01:18:34.166
- Yeah, yeah, we're OK.
- We're fine, we're fine.

01:18:34.168 --> 01:18:36.201
- Where's the treasure?
- Right here.

01:18:36.203 --> 01:18:39.138
- A poster?
- The treasure is a poster?

01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:42.006
- It's another clue, isn't it?
- I guess you could say that.

01:18:42.008 --> 01:18:45.143
Not so fast.

01:18:45.145 --> 01:18:47.979
Whatever that is, give it to us.

01:18:47.981 --> 01:18:49.216
Or else what?

01:18:51.151 --> 01:18:52.285
Skipper!

01:18:52.287 --> 01:18:56.020
It appears the dog does not
do too well with the smoke.

01:18:56.022 --> 01:18:59.023
- Let him go!
- Not until you give us that clue!

01:18:59.025 --> 01:19:02.193
OK.
But first, one more thing.

01:19:02.195 --> 01:19:04.162
And what would that be?

01:19:04.164 --> 01:19:06.165
He called me.

01:19:08.168 --> 01:19:10.702
Darn it.

01:19:10.704 --> 01:19:12.638
Not again.

01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:16.041
I did not see this one coming.

01:19:19.212 --> 01:19:21.246
Oh, buddy, are you OK?

01:19:21.248 --> 01:19:24.649
- Come on, Skipper, wake up.
- Skipper, please.

01:19:24.651 --> 01:19:27.221
- Oh, buddy.
- I'm so sorry.

01:19:29.123 --> 01:19:32.124
I didn't realize the
smoke would hurt you.

01:19:32.126 --> 01:19:35.963
Come on. You don't want to miss us
finding the treasure, do you, pal?

01:19:38.199 --> 01:19:40.135
Oh, Jack.

01:19:48.109 --> 01:19:49.407
Oh, hey!

01:19:49.409 --> 01:19:51.076
- Skipper!
- Did I save the day?

01:19:51.078 --> 01:19:53.144
I did, I saved the day.
Didn't I, huh?

01:19:53.146 --> 01:19:54.179
- I didn't?
- You're OK!

01:19:54.181 --> 01:19:56.215
I slept.
Did I fell asleep?

01:19:56.217 --> 01:19:58.186
I did? I'm sorry.

01:20:01.154 --> 01:20:03.221
You kids should have
told me about those guys.

01:20:03.223 --> 01:20:04.157
They had Skipper.

01:20:04.159 --> 01:20:05.124
Who knows what they
could have done to him.

01:20:05.126 --> 01:20:07.725
Oh, I think Skipper
can take care of himself.

01:20:07.727 --> 01:20:08.760
Oh, I think old Skipper

01:20:08.762 --> 01:20:10.696
knows how to take
care of himself.

01:20:10.698 --> 01:20:12.598
- So, let's see the clue.
- Yes, come on.

01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:16.135
- Let's see it, come on.
- I wanna see it.

01:20:16.137 --> 01:20:18.437
I remember Grandpops
telling me about this!

01:20:18.439 --> 01:20:20.238
He said it was a huge hit!

01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:22.377
But how is that a clue?

01:20:24.445 --> 01:20:26.715
It's in the shed?

01:20:30.784 --> 01:20:33.285
Oh, it's
petty dark in here, guys.

01:20:33.287 --> 01:20:36.121
OK, OK. Let's spread out
and find this thing.

01:20:36.123 --> 01:20:39.227
Treasure, treasure.
Where is the treasure?

01:20:40.794 --> 01:20:43.194
Here we go. Oh, yeah,
what've we got over here?

01:20:43.196 --> 01:20:44.263
What's this?

01:20:44.265 --> 01:20:45.663
Ugh!

01:20:45.665 --> 01:20:48.666
I don't know what that is but
someone should throw it out.

01:20:48.668 --> 01:20:49.801
Wait, what've we got over here?

01:20:49.803 --> 01:20:51.804
Hey, that's my old Frisbee.
I've been looking for that.

01:20:51.806 --> 01:20:53.138
What's this?

01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:55.640
Hey, what'd you guys find?

01:20:55.642 --> 01:20:58.178
That's Grandpop's trunk.

01:21:00.314 --> 01:21:02.350
Jack, try your key.

01:21:16.329 --> 01:21:17.196
Oh, biscuits!

01:21:17.198 --> 01:21:21.436
It's just a bunch of
old film equipment.

01:21:28.876 --> 01:21:31.876
Those aren't the kind with
the chocolate inside, right?

01:21:31.878 --> 01:21:34.212
Nope.

01:21:34.214 --> 01:21:37.282
Looks like you kids
just saved the town.

01:21:45.359 --> 01:21:49.327
Whew, do not go in there.

01:21:49.329 --> 01:21:51.630
I think this is the life.

01:21:51.632 --> 01:21:53.398
We should live here permanently.

01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:56.535
Hey, guys, nice set-up.
I like it.

01:21:56.537 --> 01:21:58.202
But I was just
talking to the mayor

01:21:58.204 --> 01:22:01.173
and he said that he would
spring for a fancy hotel

01:22:01.175 --> 01:22:03.809
'cause you guys, you know,
saved the town and everything.

01:22:03.811 --> 01:22:06.577
- What do you say?
- Hmm, I'm OK.

01:22:06.579 --> 01:22:07.845
- We're good.
- We can stay here.

01:22:07.847 --> 01:22:11.215
- Yeah.
- I would like to go to the hotel,

01:22:11.217 --> 01:22:13.318
especially if it's fancy.

01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:17.322
Sorry, Jen, I think
you're out-voted.

01:22:17.324 --> 01:22:21.693
But, on another note, I just
came from the lawyer's office

01:22:21.695 --> 01:22:27.602
and it turns out Grandpops
left another surprise for Jack.

01:22:30.404 --> 01:22:35.273
But you're only allowed to
open it on one condition.

01:22:35.275 --> 01:22:38.277
Are you ready for
another adventure?

01:22:38.279 --> 01:22:39.944
Should we do it?

01:22:39.946 --> 01:22:41.679
- Yeah.
- Good.

01:22:41.681 --> 01:22:43.682
Jack, I wouldn't.
Don't open that box.

01:22:43.684 --> 01:22:45.250
Don't open that...

01:22:45.252 --> 01:22:46.620
Oh, man.
