00:34.586 --> 00:37.077
I'm running behind
for my Booster Club meeting.

00:37.188 --> 00:40.351
Now I'll probably have to sit
at the wobbly table.

00:41.326 --> 00:42.486
Yello.

00:42.594 --> 00:45.620
Well, Substitute Teacher
of the Year, Peggy Hill.

00:45.730 --> 00:46.856
Go on.

00:47.632 --> 00:50.465
The high school? Teaching? Me?

00:50.768 --> 00:52.793
Wait, who is this really?

00:53.037 --> 00:54.197
Really?

00:54.839 --> 00:58.400
Today? Yes, of course. Oh, no. Thank you.

00:58.943 --> 01:02.310
Guess who is subbing for high school
geometry teacher Tammy Charbonneau...

01:02.413 --> 01:05.541
while she takes an eight-week,
doctor-ordered, bed-rest, maternity leave?

01:05.650 --> 01:09.347
- Me. Peggy Hill.
- That was going to be my guess exactly.

01:09.454 --> 01:14.016
This is the major leagues, Hank.
The bigs, the show.

01:14.125 --> 01:16.753
Oh, my God! Eight weeks.
Do you know what this means?

01:16.861 --> 01:20.319
It means that I have a pretty good chance
of actually learning their names.

01:20.431 --> 01:23.093
Everything's happening so fast.

01:31.809 --> 01:34.004
It's beautiful, isn't it?

01:39.951 --> 01:41.578
Tammy Charbonneau.

01:43.955 --> 01:45.320
Peggy Hill.

01:47.525 --> 01:50.392
Excusa me? Señora Miriam Caney?

01:50.628 --> 01:52.323
Me llamo Peggy Hill.

01:52.430 --> 01:55.058
I have followed your career
with such interest.

01:55.166 --> 01:57.600
Seventeen years teaching
high school Español...

01:57.702 --> 01:59.033
you have never once gotten sick...

01:59.137 --> 02:01.605
or if you have gotten sick,
you have never called in sick.

02:01.706 --> 02:03.731
Either way, I am subbing geometry.

02:03.841 --> 02:06.810
Well, bienvenido a Arlen High.

02:06.911 --> 02:09.401
My, what lovely spectacles.

02:09.913 --> 02:12.815
The better to see
promising new talent with.

02:16.854 --> 02:18.219
Here you go.

02:18.856 --> 02:23.316
ANNOUNCER: Number 33,
David Kalaiki Alii, The Flying Hawaiian!

02:23.428 --> 02:25.953
He says aloha to the end zone...

02:26.064 --> 02:28.999
and aloha to the Temple Tigers.

02:29.100 --> 02:32.160
It means both hello and goodbye.

02:32.270 --> 02:34.431
My wife is Polynesian.

02:34.539 --> 02:37.167
Arlen High is unstoppable!

02:37.442 --> 02:39.467
[All cheering excitedly]

02:42.046 --> 02:44.571
First order of Booster Club business.

02:44.682 --> 02:48.118
How's the programs coming
for next week's game? Terrel.

02:49.053 --> 02:52.147
As you all know,
the money from the programs...

02:52.256 --> 02:54.622
help pay for the cheerleaders' shoes.

02:54.726 --> 02:57.490
Every business owner here has taken out...

02:57.595 --> 03:00.155
ad space in this week's program...

03:00.264 --> 03:03.756
except Dale Gribble of Dale's Dead-Bug.

03:08.172 --> 03:12.131
My secretary messed up again?
She is so fired.

03:14.245 --> 03:17.009
[Suspenseful instrumental music]

03:19.684 --> 03:24.087
And the man walked
around the world and said to the king:

03:24.489 --> 03:26.980
"Sir, I come from France.

03:27.859 --> 03:29.827
"Sir-come for-ance."

03:30.061 --> 03:31.255
You see?

03:31.362 --> 03:32.488
[Peggy chuckling]

03:35.233 --> 03:39.602
- Hey, dude.
- And you must be David Kalaiki Alii.

03:39.837 --> 03:42.533
Yup. I guess you might have heard of me.

03:42.640 --> 03:44.369
Hey, how's it going?

03:44.609 --> 03:47.100
Yes. You are the person
who did not answer present...

03:47.211 --> 03:49.179
when I took roll 28 minutes ago.

03:49.547 --> 03:50.639
Okay.

03:50.748 --> 03:53.808
I see from Miss Charbonneau's notes
that you all have some homework due.

03:53.918 --> 03:56.682
So, I'll start with you, David.

03:58.089 --> 04:02.549
I didn't do it.
I'll take a C or a B or whatever.

04:02.660 --> 04:05.629
I am not going to tell you
how to do your job.

04:12.470 --> 04:13.698
Peggy!

04:14.372 --> 04:17.238
Hurry up and sit down
before the PE coaches get here.

04:17.341 --> 04:19.103
It gets in your clothes.

04:19.510 --> 04:21.875
- So, how's your day going?
- Glorious.

04:22.180 --> 04:26.014
Although, can I ask you if you know
a student named David Kalaiki Alii?

04:26.117 --> 04:29.484
The Flying Hawaiian. He runs the 40 in 4.5.

04:29.587 --> 04:30.986
Yes. Anyway...

04:31.089 --> 04:34.684
I checked David's records
and he has a B-plus average overall.

04:34.892 --> 04:38.953
But he seems to have trouble
applying himself in geometry.

04:39.363 --> 04:42.127
Marlin Atwater,
Assistant Driver's Ed/Health.

04:42.233 --> 04:44.667
Peggy, David is our star fullback.

04:44.769 --> 04:48.034
He doesn't have a lot of time to study,
so we cut him some slack.

04:48.139 --> 04:51.074
At Tom Landry Middle School,
we would never think of extending...

04:51.175 --> 04:53.075
special privileges to the athletes.

04:53.177 --> 04:55.941
Peggy, this isn't middle school,
this is real life.

04:56.047 --> 04:58.515
We've got college football scouts
at our games...

04:58.616 --> 05:02.017
and they're not coming to watch David
draw a triangle.

05:02.553 --> 05:07.047
Don't worry, Peggy.
David Kalaiki Alii is un-teachable anyway.

05:07.258 --> 05:08.452
Un-teachable?

05:08.559 --> 05:12.188
I spent six weeks in Health
trying to get him to brush up and down.

05:12.296 --> 05:13.888
He's like a wall.

05:16.834 --> 05:20.668
And he continued to sleep peacefully.
It was pure chaos.

05:20.772 --> 05:22.364
Well, how about that?

05:22.473 --> 05:26.569
Your first day on campus
and you already met David Kalaiki Alii.

05:26.677 --> 05:28.508
He's The Flying Hawaiian!

05:30.715 --> 05:33.013
If I were two years younger...

05:33.117 --> 05:35.745
Well, first, he is your age. And second...

05:36.254 --> 05:40.588
David is considered a special case.
They call him "un-teachable."

05:40.758 --> 05:43.318
Well, he can't be good at everything.

05:43.461 --> 05:45.190
You'd be surprised, Bobby.

05:45.296 --> 05:49.198
He plays offense, defense,
and returns punts.

05:49.400 --> 05:52.767
It looks like Luanne isn't the only one
with a crush on David.

05:52.870 --> 05:55.805
But you know what?
He's just another student to me.

05:55.907 --> 05:58.535
No different from the nerds
or the suck-ups.

05:58.643 --> 06:03.137
And I have decided to give that boy
the high-school education he deserves.

06:04.715 --> 06:06.683
So, it may only be a theory...

06:06.784 --> 06:07.751
[School bell ringing]

06:07.852 --> 06:10.320
But it will, in fact,
be on next week's midterm.

06:13.591 --> 06:16.617
Oh, wait. David.
Honey, can you spare a moment?

06:16.994 --> 06:19.690
I wanted to talk to you
about your class work.

06:19.797 --> 06:22.789
I have noticed that you have a zero grade.

06:22.900 --> 06:26.392
You have no homework points
and no participation points.

06:28.906 --> 06:29.964
[Grunts in assent]

06:30.074 --> 06:32.702
I would like to tutor you after class.

06:32.944 --> 06:35.242
I have football practice after class.

06:36.447 --> 06:39.143
How about geometry practice after that...

06:39.250 --> 06:42.185
with a play book by Coach Peggy Hill?

06:43.821 --> 06:44.879
Okay.

06:46.324 --> 06:49.521
And, David, I'm glad we got to rap.

07:08.112 --> 07:09.977
- There you are!
- David.

07:10.882 --> 07:12.110
David.

07:13.317 --> 07:14.443
David!

07:14.552 --> 07:15.678
[Pop music playing on car stereo]

07:17.521 --> 07:19.455
David!

07:20.024 --> 07:21.184
David!

07:23.227 --> 07:25.388
David, you forgot your notes.

07:25.696 --> 07:27.493
Hey, you know, you run fast.

07:39.944 --> 07:41.275
PEGGY: Stop!

07:41.379 --> 07:43.370
Okay. Please hand in your midterm.

07:43.481 --> 07:44.709
[School bell ringing]

07:44.815 --> 07:49.081
David, I just want to say that
it has been a pleasure educating you.

07:49.186 --> 07:53.179
I think I have learned just as much
from you as you have from me.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.551
- Well.
- Okay.

08:04.535 --> 08:06.059
[Tense instrumental music]

08:07.939 --> 08:12.638
Okay. Quarter inch to the left,
and eighth inch back to the right.

08:13.044 --> 08:16.605
- No, an eighth.
- Hank! We just lost our star fullback.

08:16.847 --> 08:19.839
- What? What happened?
- Peggy Hill happened.

08:19.951 --> 08:22.579
"No pass, no play!" She flunked David.

08:22.687 --> 08:24.985
Now he's out for three weeks
academic suspension.

08:25.089 --> 08:27.080
Do you know what happens
in those three weeks?

08:27.191 --> 08:31.355
San Marcos, Belton, McMaynerbury.
McMaynerbury, Hank!

08:31.462 --> 08:34.522
Now, hold on.
I'm sure it was just an accident.

08:34.631 --> 08:37.429
No, Hank. This is an accident.

08:41.105 --> 08:44.006
Now you got two messes to clean up.

08:59.924 --> 09:02.916
How could you flunk The Flying Hawaiian?

09:03.027 --> 09:05.552
Haven't you ever heard
of "no pass, no play"?

09:05.663 --> 09:09.895
Do not try to pin all of this on me.
I only did the "no pass."

09:10.234 --> 09:12.725
What happens after that
is none of my business.

09:12.837 --> 09:15.067
I want you to change his grade.

09:15.172 --> 09:19.609
If I were to give David a passing grade,
that would be a failure on my part.

09:19.710 --> 09:24.238
And I am not failing. I am doing A work.

09:24.548 --> 09:28.143
This is crunch time.
We're going up against San Marcos...

09:28.252 --> 09:31.119
Belton, and McMaynerbury.
McMaynerbury!

09:31.222 --> 09:32.746
We need him to go to state.

09:32.857 --> 09:37.294
I am sorry, Hank. But teaching high school
is my "going to state."

09:38.396 --> 09:43.026
No offense, Peggy, but I don't see anybody
renting buses to go to your state.

09:50.908 --> 09:54.105
Hey, guys. You know,
the strangest thing happened today.

09:54.211 --> 09:58.011
A giant rat crawled into my inbox
and died.

10:02.953 --> 10:06.684
- What happened to your frames?
- They suddenly went out of style.

10:06.857 --> 10:09.087
This is about David, isn't it?

10:10.061 --> 10:13.758
David did failing work.
He got a failing grade.

10:13.864 --> 10:17.595
Of all people, I would expect
my fellow educators to support me.

10:17.701 --> 10:20.534
You want to change the world,
go back to middle school.

10:20.638 --> 10:22.333
It's too late here.

10:26.477 --> 10:29.446
ANNOUNCER: And a third fumble
from senior Charlie Macken...

10:29.547 --> 10:32.744
who was named Arlen's
Scholar Athlete of the Year!

10:32.850 --> 10:34.875
He's all yours, Princeton!

10:38.456 --> 10:40.720
PRESIDENT: All right.
We can absorb this loss.

10:40.825 --> 10:42.952
And it wasn't a conference game.

10:43.060 --> 10:45.221
And we'll probably squeak by next week...

10:45.329 --> 10:48.093
because Belton's still reeling
from the drug bust!

10:48.199 --> 10:50.224
And then it's McMaynerbury!

10:50.334 --> 10:53.895
And there's not a single addict
on that mother-loving team!

10:54.772 --> 10:57.900
Dickie, there's got to be something
in those law books of yours.

10:58.008 --> 10:59.635
Look under "loophole."

10:59.743 --> 11:03.406
What if we got him a work-study
like I had at the print shop my junior year?

11:03.514 --> 11:08.451
Yeah. David drops Mrs. Hill's class,
takes a work-study at Terrell's print shop.

11:08.552 --> 11:11.578
Hey, look, I got Billy
breathing down my neck as it is.

11:11.689 --> 11:14.385
I don't need another punk in there
making me look bad.

11:14.492 --> 11:17.791
I volunteer Strickland Propane
to jump through this little loophole.

11:17.895 --> 11:22.298
Now, David can work for me till
the swallows get back from Capastrami.

11:22.566 --> 11:25.399
Hank, can you slap together
a make-up mid-term?

11:25.503 --> 11:28.939
I'll do it quickly,
but it won't be slapped together.

11:30.241 --> 11:34.200
And the vaporization rate
of a 100-pound propane cylinder...

11:34.311 --> 11:38.407
at 70 degrees Fahrenheit,
is how many BTU's per hour?

11:40.985 --> 11:42.680
Can I have a chair?

11:44.221 --> 11:46.553
- Propane 101?
- Yeah.

11:46.657 --> 11:50.559
It's a work-study thing
approved by the Board of Education.

11:50.661 --> 11:54.563
So, you and your waffle boys
did an end run around Peggy Hill.

11:54.665 --> 11:58.863
Peggy, years from now
no one will remember what a hexagon is...

11:59.336 --> 12:03.397
but you win state
and that goes up on the water tower.

12:05.042 --> 12:08.534
- And how is David doing?
- David is doing great.

12:10.281 --> 12:13.978
He knows more about propane
than any Hawaiian I've ever met.

12:15.586 --> 12:19.317
He does? Oh, what was I thinking?

12:20.691 --> 12:22.283
I am in over my head.

12:22.393 --> 12:25.521
What made me think
that I could teach high school?

12:25.696 --> 12:28.494
I so wanted to be like
Welcome Back, Kotter.

12:28.599 --> 12:32.626
Now I'm like the real Gabe Kaplan.
I am a loser.

12:35.272 --> 12:38.867
Okay. The test is gonna be
one essay question...

12:38.976 --> 12:40.773
open serviceman's manual.

12:40.878 --> 12:44.575
Just tell me what you love most
about propane.

12:58.729 --> 13:00.219
Nice hand-off.

13:00.664 --> 13:04.566
Just like the one you did
three weeks ago in the game.

13:06.804 --> 13:09.967
All right. Let's see what we got here.

13:10.407 --> 13:11.465
Okay.

13:11.575 --> 13:13.975
"Strickland Propene...

13:14.278 --> 13:17.304
"does not have a vending machine.

13:17.481 --> 13:22.214
"It smells, and I thank God every day
I get home...

13:22.686 --> 13:26.315
"that I didn't get exploded. The end."

13:45.142 --> 13:47.906
May God have mercy on me.

14:03.494 --> 14:04.984
David passed, didn't he?

14:05.095 --> 14:08.121
Oh, yeah. I guess he did pass.

14:08.232 --> 14:09.859
I gave him an A.

14:11.535 --> 14:12.934
So coupled with my F...

14:13.037 --> 14:16.200
your A brings him
to a respectable passing C.

14:16.940 --> 14:19.465
Well, good for you. Good for David.

14:19.910 --> 14:23.505
Good for Arlen football.
Everybody's a winner.

14:23.881 --> 14:28.250
Yeah. Though the principal
kind of threw out your F.

14:29.119 --> 14:31.383
So right now he's on honor roll.

14:34.391 --> 14:37.087
I just wanted you to hear that from me.

14:37.661 --> 14:41.529
All I'm saying is
you have the tendencies of a Capricorn.

14:41.932 --> 14:43.399
- There's Hank!
- Hey!

14:43.500 --> 14:47.869
[Singing] For Hank's a jolly good fellow
For Hank's a jolly good fellow

14:47.971 --> 14:50.633
For Hank's a jolly good fellow

14:50.741 --> 14:52.675
Because we're going to state

14:52.776 --> 14:56.268
Because he gave David Kalaiki Alii an A.

14:56.380 --> 14:58.280
- Because he gave...
- All right.

14:59.216 --> 15:03.084
I will not have a respected educator
bend over for his own beer.

15:03.253 --> 15:06.051
Make Peggy do it.
She's got to be good for something.

15:06.156 --> 15:09.819
Now, that is not fair, Dale.
Peggy did the best she could.

15:09.927 --> 15:11.724
Which was crappy.

15:13.864 --> 15:17.300
So, I'm afraid I will have to take
an emergency medical leave.

15:17.901 --> 15:21.428
Well, I have diagnosed myself
as having the early stages...

15:21.538 --> 15:23.904
of single-digit carpal tunnel syndrome.

15:24.007 --> 15:26.237
Or as I call it, "chalk finger."

15:27.010 --> 15:27.999
[Hank sighs]

15:28.112 --> 15:32.310
David failed that test.
His essay made me want to vomit.

15:32.883 --> 15:36.580
Which I did. But I gave him that A
to get us to state.

15:38.822 --> 15:43.020
Hank Hill, I am speechless.
I literally have nothing to say.

15:43.460 --> 15:44.722
Not one word.

15:45.129 --> 15:46.221
Nada.

15:46.630 --> 15:47.756
Zilch.

15:48.999 --> 15:50.057
Zero.

15:51.502 --> 15:53.493
I don't know what you're waiting for.

15:56.073 --> 15:57.404
[Men cheering loudly]

15:57.508 --> 15:58.839
All right!

15:58.942 --> 16:01.843
Get this beautiful human being
some waffles.

16:01.945 --> 16:04.072
MAN 1: Yeah! Way to go, Hank!

16:04.181 --> 16:05.170
[Men booing]

16:05.282 --> 16:07.045
MAN 2: Get her out of here.

16:08.118 --> 16:12.020
David Kalaiki Alii received an A...

16:12.122 --> 16:14.022
on his propane exam.

16:15.025 --> 16:16.390
All right!

16:16.493 --> 16:19.087
But he deserved an F.

16:20.964 --> 16:22.955
[All cheering excitedly]

16:23.500 --> 16:25.127
Long live, Hank!

16:25.235 --> 16:27.066
Now, my wife Peggy...

16:27.304 --> 16:28.862
[Crowd booing]

16:29.139 --> 16:31.266
Now, hold on.

16:31.508 --> 16:34.671
Sure, a week ago
I would have been booing my wife...

16:34.778 --> 16:37.770
HANK: Right along with you guys.
DALE: You were, Hank.

16:39.116 --> 16:40.208
Yeah.

16:40.317 --> 16:44.276
But what I realized
is that she was right all along.

16:44.822 --> 16:49.225
It's time to ground The Flying Hawaiian.
I'm giving him an F.

16:49.326 --> 16:52.921
Too late. I already turned in
the sign-off sheet and the grade.

16:53.030 --> 16:54.463
David is in!

16:54.565 --> 16:56.624
Sir, did you read that essay?

16:57.367 --> 16:58.800
It's a classic.

16:58.902 --> 17:02.702
"I thank God every day
I didn't get exploded."

17:02.940 --> 17:04.237
Gets to you.

17:04.340 --> 17:07.833
Excuse me. But I cannot let you
ruin that boy's life.

17:08.045 --> 17:09.979
I think that there might be people...

17:10.079 --> 17:14.039
who would be interested in the fact that
David is being deprived of an education...

17:14.151 --> 17:17.608
such as his mother, and the school board...

17:17.721 --> 17:19.586
and the secretary of education.

17:19.690 --> 17:21.920
Whoa right there! Wait a minute.

17:22.025 --> 17:25.017
Look. We don't want to go dragging
the boy's mother into this.

17:25.127 --> 17:27.688
I'm sure we could work something out.

17:31.034 --> 17:35.494
You may keep your creamy bribe.
We are going to his mother.

17:36.106 --> 17:38.267
And we are gonna tell on you.

17:40.511 --> 17:43.742
The Booster Club is cheating David
out of an education.

17:44.014 --> 17:47.006
And what is worse,
David is cheating himself.

17:47.317 --> 17:49.581
I'd like to show you something.

17:51.388 --> 17:53.322
David is learning disabled.

17:53.557 --> 17:56.492
He studies every day
as soon as he gets home from practice...

17:56.593 --> 17:58.993
until he falls asleep every night.

17:59.630 --> 18:02.997
I usually come in and find him
slumped over his desk...

18:03.100 --> 18:06.501
using that play book you made him
as a pillow.

18:07.037 --> 18:10.495
He's a good boy.
He just has trouble retaining anything.

18:10.807 --> 18:12.968
He deserves an A for effort, though.

18:13.076 --> 18:15.237
No wonder even I couldn't teach him.

18:15.445 --> 18:17.606
Sports is all God gave David.

18:17.714 --> 18:20.649
And it's the only way he'll get to college.

18:22.052 --> 18:23.986
Well, then...

18:24.288 --> 18:27.689
we're sorry to have disturbed you,
Mrs. Kalaiki Alii.

18:33.597 --> 18:37.533
And the Oscar goes to me!

18:38.268 --> 18:39.792
Come on out, fellows.

18:40.470 --> 18:43.735
We smoked them good.
Bought it hook, line, and sinker.

18:43.840 --> 18:45.831
Thanks to you, Mrs. K.A.

18:47.210 --> 18:48.871
Hey, what's all this crap?

18:49.479 --> 18:51.106
Where's all my Swanks?

18:51.214 --> 18:52.738
We kept you in the game, stud.

18:52.849 --> 18:55.340
Hey, what's going on?

18:56.053 --> 18:57.850
I know all my ABC's.

18:57.955 --> 19:00.549
The Hills were gonna turn you in
for flunking.

19:00.657 --> 19:04.286
- We told them you were a slowpoke.
- I'm not stupid.

19:04.728 --> 19:07.094
I can't believe you did this.

19:07.197 --> 19:08.528
It's so...

19:09.600 --> 19:10.828
stupid.

19:10.968 --> 19:13.732
David, stupid is going
to get you to college.

19:13.837 --> 19:15.964
I'll tell you what's stupid.

19:16.073 --> 19:20.032
Me giving you that Trans Am
if you ain't gonna drive us to state!

19:29.319 --> 19:30.650
Hey, Miss Hill.

19:30.754 --> 19:34.952
Oh, no, David.
The pep rally is down the hallway, honey.

19:35.492 --> 19:38.154
Wait. Did you poop yourself?

19:38.395 --> 19:39.885
I deserve that.

19:40.063 --> 19:41.860
I guess if I'd worked harder...

19:41.965 --> 19:45.264
you guys wouldn't be so willing
to believe I was learning-disabled.

19:45.369 --> 19:48.998
You're not? But that explained everything.

19:49.106 --> 19:50.733
It was all a sham.

19:50.841 --> 19:53.309
My mom and the Booster Club
cooked it up.

19:53.610 --> 19:56.408
Wait. "Sham," that's the right word, right?

19:56.513 --> 19:59.949
Yes. But I would have said "scheme."
It conveys more sneakiness.

20:00.050 --> 20:04.783
Yeah. Well, I've been thinking about this
"no pass, no play" stuff.

20:05.188 --> 20:08.180
And if I don't pass, then I should "no play."

20:08.725 --> 20:09.783
Really?

20:09.893 --> 20:12.453
I probably should have something
to fall back on, anyway.

20:12.562 --> 20:15.929
I mean, the odds of me
not making pro are what, 50-50?

20:16.199 --> 20:19.032
So, what do you say
you teach me geometry before the game?

20:19.136 --> 20:21.195
I am so proud of you, David.

20:21.304 --> 20:24.740
But I could not even teach Albert Einstein
all of geometry...

20:24.841 --> 20:26.035
in an afternoon.

20:26.143 --> 20:29.237
Even if it meant
that Einstein's team could go to state.

20:33.150 --> 20:34.549
Wait.

20:34.651 --> 20:37.950
Maybe there is something
you can learn in an afternoon.

20:38.422 --> 20:41.255
HANK: So, you see, propane is a liquid.

20:41.591 --> 20:44.355
But it comes out as a gas.

20:46.830 --> 20:50.322
What you need, David,
is a way of associating the lesson...

20:50.434 --> 20:52.459
with something that's familiar to you.

20:52.569 --> 20:56.130
For instance, okay, Gatorade is a liquid...

20:56.239 --> 21:00.039
but when you dump it on the coach,
it's a gas. Get it?

21:00.143 --> 21:01.508
- I get that.
- Great!

21:01.611 --> 21:03.044
Hey, but that's not right.

21:03.146 --> 21:07.276
And if you want to remember
the chemical formula for propane C3H8...

21:07.718 --> 21:10.243
maybe you could remember it
like an audible.

21:10.353 --> 21:14.380
C! Three! H! Eight! Propane!

21:14.491 --> 21:15.958
Propane! Hike!

21:22.399 --> 21:23.866
You guys need a ride?

21:23.967 --> 21:26.060
I'm gonna be smoking on that field!

21:26.436 --> 21:30.964
But not near a propane tank
because propane is flammable.

21:33.076 --> 21:37.479
ANNOUNCER: And here he is,
back after a short educational hiatus...

21:37.581 --> 21:41.984
The Flying Hawaiian, David Kalaiki Alii!

21:43.053 --> 21:46.284
Who's stupid now, huh? Not David.

21:46.423 --> 21:49.824
Yup. Not David, Hank. Not David at all.

22:29.533 --> 22:31.467
PEGGY: I don't know
what you're waiting for.
