WEBVTT

00:22.400 --> 00:23.465
What the hell, man?

00:23.500 --> 00:26.265
You can't find us
a cleared path?

00:26.300 --> 00:28.900
Wildlife knows to stay away
from the public park.

00:29.300 --> 00:32.600
You want to hunt game,
cut your own path.

00:47.800 --> 00:49.700
Oh, you're a badass, Denny.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.600
Still got the price tag
on your pants.

00:51.635 --> 00:53.000
Leave it, dude.

00:53.400 --> 00:55.100
30 days... I can return them.

00:56.100 --> 00:57.300
Shut up.

00:58.900 --> 01:01.400
We won't see any game
if you guys keep yapping.

01:06.100 --> 01:08.200
Something's behind those pes.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.200
White-tailed deer
feed around here.

01:11.800 --> 01:13.300
Well, let's go get them.

01:14.500 --> 01:16.500
Slow down.

01:17.200 --> 01:19.100
Find a spot...

01:19.600 --> 01:22.900
...and then wait
and let them come to you.

01:27.600 --> 01:28.600
Rob, you see anything?

01:28.635 --> 01:31.100
No Dennis?

01:33.900 --> 01:35.600
Watch carefully, gentlemen.

01:36.100 --> 01:37.800
This is how it's done.

01:44.100 --> 01:45.600
Hey, way to go, Rambo.

01:45.635 --> 01:46.800
Hey, guys,

01:47.000 --> 01:49.400
isn't it weird
that they're running towards us?

02:02.100 --> 02:03.065
Don't run!

02:03.100 --> 02:04.265
Yell, wave your arms!

02:04.300 --> 02:06.200
He'll think you're larger
than you are!

02:39.500 --> 02:41.200
Yogi over there
is one big-ass bear.

02:41.235 --> 02:42.365
Close to 800 pounds.

02:42.400 --> 02:45.300
800 pounds and counting, Frank.

02:47.600 --> 02:49.800
He's park services problem now.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.600
Our victim's Dennis West.

02:51.900 --> 02:53.900
He's a hunter
down from Tallahassee.

02:54.200 --> 02:56.400
What do you think
he was doing out here?

02:56.435 --> 02:57.900
Part of a hunting package.

02:58.200 --> 03:00.200
Guide's name is Chuck Greene.

03:00.800 --> 03:02.200
Mr. Greene...

03:02.400 --> 03:04.000
Was this man an experienced hunter?

03:04.035 --> 03:06.500
No. Neither were his friends.

03:06.700 --> 03:10.300
More interested in the toys
than bringing home any meat.

03:10.335 --> 03:11.900
Where were you
during the attack?

03:12.700 --> 03:14.000
Right over there.

03:14.300 --> 03:16.000
I tried to tell them...
the worst thing you can do

03:16.035 --> 03:17.465
is turn your back anrun.

03:17.500 --> 03:20.100
I don't think the problem
was turning his back.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.800
Take a look at this vest.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.800
It's coated with
some kind of substance.

03:31.200 --> 03:32.600
Vanilla gel.

03:32.900 --> 03:34.400
That's bear lure.

03:34.500 --> 03:37.165
So that would attract
bears from miles, wouldn't it?

03:37.200 --> 03:39.800
No hunter would knowingly lather
himself up with that stuff.

03:39.835 --> 03:43.200
So that means our victim
was the bait.

04:39.900 --> 04:40.900
Gentlemen.

04:41.400 --> 04:43.000
Who would want Dennis dead?

04:45.200 --> 04:46.500
I don't know.
We're not even from here.

04:46.535 --> 04:47.700
No one knows us.

04:47.800 --> 04:48.565
We're... old college buddies,

04:48.600 --> 04:50.800
and we're just here on
a vacation pkage.

04:51.100 --> 04:52.500
What kind of package?

04:54.900 --> 04:56.500
It's called a "man-cation. "

04:57.100 --> 04:58.065
It's a weekend trip.

04:58.100 --> 04:59.300
You know, vacation for men.

04:59.335 --> 05:00.017
Look, we're 60-hour-a-week

05:00.052 --> 05:00.700
We just needed to get out.

05:00.735 --> 05:01.500
desk jockeys, okay?

05:02.600 --> 05:04.400
Mr. Wolfe,
check them, please.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.700
What, are we radioactive
or something?

05:14.200 --> 05:16.900
I got moderate levels
of glycerin and vanillin.

05:17.300 --> 05:18.265
What that means,
gentlemen,

05:18.300 --> 05:21.100
is the same attractant
is all over you.

05:22.500 --> 05:23.865
How'd it get on us?

05:23.900 --> 05:26.100
That's what we need to find out,
isn't it?

05:34.000 --> 05:35.200
So how you doing?

05:35.600 --> 05:37.200
Good. I'm 100%.

05:38.900 --> 05:41.600
Lab get a new piece of
equipment while I was down?

05:42.700 --> 05:44.200
Eric, this is the MiniRae.

05:44.235 --> 05:45.700
Remember you showed it to me?

05:48.400 --> 05:50.100
Well, what are we
using it for here?

05:51.200 --> 05:52.665
Well, vanilla'
a pretty strong scent.

05:52.700 --> 05:56.100
Hopefully, the MiniRae can
follow the lure to its source.

05:57.600 --> 05:58.500
That's right.

05:58.800 --> 06:00.000
Find the lure...

06:00.400 --> 06:02.300
and we find the guy
who put it on the hunters.

06:02.335 --> 06:03.500
Exactly.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.900
Got the first sign
of blood... starts here.

06:17.935 --> 06:19.765
Well, the victim
was attacked here

06:19.800 --> 06:21.600
and probably dragged
to where we found him.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
Yeah, that bear came on him
really quickly.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.565
You know, these guys were
all in decent shape. Â­

06:31.600 --> 06:33.900
I'm surprised ey didn't get
a little farther than they did.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.100
They were running
for their lives.

06:35.135 --> 06:37.700
It was hardly a track meet.

06:38.700 --> 06:39.800
Wait a minute.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.500
I've got something.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.365
27 parts per million.

06:44.400 --> 06:47.800
The, uh... scent's
getting stronger.

06:55.400 --> 06:56.800
It's up to 60.

07:03.100 --> 07:04.600
Get off my property.

07:05.600 --> 07:07.800
Miami-Dade
Police Department, sir.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.100
We need to ask you
a few questions.

07:11.700 --> 07:12.700
What's your name?

07:13.200 --> 07:14.265
Chadwick.

07:14.300 --> 07:16.600
You liveere alone, Mr. Chadwick?

07:17.100 --> 07:18.200
Yep.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.200
We're investigating the murder of a
hunter that happened this morning.

07:22.500 --> 07:24.200
About a mile from here.

07:25.500 --> 07:27.200
I don't know nothin'
about that.

07:27.700 --> 07:29.400
What do you use
this glycerin for?

07:29.800 --> 07:31.300
Make my own lure.

07:31.600 --> 07:33.065
Wi game. Is that a crime?

07:33.100 --> 07:35.100
Not unless you
used it for one.

07:37.300 --> 07:39.400
Hey, you want to be careful
with that, Hoss?

07:39.600 --> 07:41.800
I don't need the bears
come snooping around here.

07:41.835 --> 07:43.300
This is vanilla.

07:43.700 --> 07:45.800
Just like on
our dead hunter.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.300
Hey, don't look at me.

07:48.335 --> 07:49.900
I sell the stuff.

07:50.600 --> 07:51.365
Hunters...

07:51.400 --> 07:52.600
photographers...

07:52.635 --> 07:53.765
movie big shots...

07:53.800 --> 07:57.300
they all want to see what's
hidden out here in the swamps.

07:57.500 --> 08:01.500
You don't happen to have a list of
the people you sell it to, do you?

08:02.100 --> 08:03.700
I keep my receipts.

08:06.100 --> 08:07.600
Taxes.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.800
Well, I'm going to need
to see that receipt book.

08:16.300 --> 08:19.200
Mr. Greene, you bought
homemade vanilla bear lure

08:19.235 --> 08:21.600
from a guy in the Glades,
is that correct?

08:21.900 --> 08:23.365
We, Billy makes
the best stuff.

08:23.400 --> 08:26.600
Can virtually guarantee a bear
sighting at any one of my hunts.

08:26.635 --> 08:29.200
These city boys pay good money
for their hunting weekends.

08:29.235 --> 08:30.900
They want the whole experiefce.

08:31.300 --> 08:34.700
Does the whole experience
include putting bear lure on them?

08:36.100 --> 08:37.299
No way.

08:37.799 --> 08:40.299
I just put a little bit
on the trees nearby.

08:40.700 --> 08:42.500
I'm real sorry
about what happened,

08:42.900 --> 08:44.700
but it wasn't my fault.

08:45.300 --> 08:47.800
All these guys wanted
to do was party.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.800
Play around with the guns
like they were big-game hunting.

08:51.400 --> 08:53.400
That was the experience
they wanted.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.200
Well, then I guess they got
more than they paid for.

09:05.600 --> 09:06.665
yes, Alexx.

09:06.700 --> 09:08.850
What you got
on our dead hunter?

09:08.885 --> 09:10.965
Huh. Massive soft tissue damage.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.500
Liver, stomach and intestines
are absent.

09:13.700 --> 09:15.265
Long bone fractures.

09:15.300 --> 09:17.100
All consistent with mauling.

09:17.600 --> 09:20.450
You know, the scene indicated
he didn't run very far.

09:20.485 --> 09:23.300
Well, according to his medical
records he was healthy.

09:23.400 --> 09:27.065
Save for a twisted ankle running
the Boston Marathon last year.

09:27.100 --> 09:32.200
So he should have been able to put more than
a f feet distance between him and that bear.

09:34.400 --> 09:36.200
Not with this knee, honey.

09:40.700 --> 09:42.065
That bruise looks fresh.

09:42.100 --> 09:45.000
Baby boy had a comminuted
fracture of the patella.

09:45.200 --> 09:47.000
See the stellate pattern?

09:49.000 --> 09:49.865
A busted kneecap.

09:49.900 --> 09:51.165
You think he did that
in the attack?

09:51.200 --> 09:55.200
Nope. I would expect to see less
of a fracture and more cartilage damage.

09:56.200 --> 09:58.400
Nope. I would expect to see less of a fracture and more
cartilage damage. The bruise has a rectangular shape.

09:58.435 --> 09:59.900
With a crisscross pattern.

10:04.300 --> 10:05.900
I know exactly what made it.

10:06.100 --> 10:07.500
That was fast.

10:07.535 --> 10:08.900
Butt of a rifle.

10:10.500 --> 10:12.500
Dennis was put down
by one of his own.

10:17.900 --> 10:20.050
That is a bruise
on Dennis West's leg.

10:20.085 --> 10:22.200
We matched it
to the stock of your rifle.

10:22.900 --> 10:24.100
You crippled him.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.200
It was chaos.

10:27.600 --> 10:28.465
We were all scrambling.

10:28.500 --> 10:29.900
I don't even remember
what happened.

10:35.700 --> 10:37.365
's one thing
to outrun soone,

10:37.400 --> 10:39.600
it's another thing
to take them out.

10:44.400 --> 10:45.900
Sorry.

10:47.100 --> 10:49.500
I can't remember
any specific details.

10:51.300 --> 10:53.400
So you going to
arrest me or something?

10:53.600 --> 10:55.300
Not at this time.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.400
Well, okay.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.500
Let me know if you have
any other questions.

11:05.100 --> 11:07.500
All right, so we go over
his every move.

11:07.535 --> 11:10.600
Yes, we start
where they stayed.

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
This is an awfully
nice hotel room for a hunting weekend.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.300
Calleigh.

12:16.900 --> 12:18.800
There's definitely
more to the story.

12:21.300 --> 12:23.900
That is a significant
amount of blood.

12:26.900 --> 12:27.965
Yeah, they tried to clean it up

12:28.000 --> 12:30.400
but they didn't realize
the tile was loose.

12:35.800 --> 12:37.900
Bear's not the only killer
in Mmi.

12:38.300 --> 12:39.700
I think we have another victim.

12:39.900 --> 12:42.600
Let's find out what these guys
were really hunting.

13:08.540 --> 13:10.090
There's more blood over here.

13:10.125 --> 13:11.640
It's gravitational drops.

13:12.140 --> 13:14.240
Yeah, maybe the suspect
was injured.

13:21.940 --> 13:25.340
You got all the hunters' DNA references
at the Everglades scene,didn't you?

13:25.375 --> 13:26.505
Yeah.

13:26.540 --> 13:27.605
Primed and ready to go.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.440
I got Natalia waiting
back at the lab.

13:37.440 --> 13:38.640
Hey

13:38.740 --> 13:40.105
Do you think this
came with the room?

13:40.140 --> 13:42.340
No, this place has
a built-in sound system.

13:42.540 --> 13:44.740
Then I wonder who
brought this here.

13:54.240 --> 13:57.440
Maybe we can identify the owner
from the personal playlist.

13:59.340 --> 14:00.940
Could lead us
to our blood donor.

14:13.340 --> 14:14.705
I have a theory.

14:14.740 --> 14:18.440
You can tell a lot about a person
by what they have on their MP3 player.

14:18.475 --> 14:19.405
What you got?

14:19.440 --> 14:21.440
With five Tori Amos
albums on this thing,

14:21.640 --> 14:23.040
we're looking for a girl.

14:23.075 --> 14:24.405
Okay, but I need aame.

14:24.440 --> 14:25.540
There wasn't one on the player?

14:25.575 --> 14:26.540
Nothing.

14:26.840 --> 14:29.840
BuI am going to get you that
name from the music on the player.

14:33.840 --> 14:35.205
Kelly Clarkson, Ludacris...

14:35.240 --> 14:37.105
I mean, half the country
has these songs.

14:37.140 --> 14:40.140
See, when you purchase a song
from the Mystx-Trax website,

14:40.175 --> 14:41.305
it comes from a server farm

14:41.340 --> 14:43.640
allowing Mystx-Trax
to record the purchase.

14:43.675 --> 14:45.940
They know every song
a customer has downloaded.

15:09.040 --> 15:12.340
And they gave yourtruly
temporary access.

15:12.640 --> 15:15.440
So if you match the downloaded
songs on the player

15:15.475 --> 15:18.240
to Mystx's records,
you can find out who owns it?

15:19.540 --> 15:20.640
Aha.

15:21.940 --> 15:23.540
And there it is.

15:23.940 --> 15:25.540
Told you it was a girl.

15:25.740 --> 15:27.440
Anna Sivarro.

15:31.340 --> 15:32.205
Yeah, it's mine.

15:32.240 --> 15:34.140
It got stolen out of my car.

15:35.940 --> 15:37.240
Did you report it?

15:38.340 --> 15:42.140
Oh, I'm sure you would've rushed
right down to investigate.

15:43.440 --> 15:44.305
What am I doing here exactly?

15:45.190 --> 15:49.090
Ms. Sivarro, I brought you in
to make sure you're okay.

15:55.390 --> 15:58.390
Well, aren't you all
"protect and serve. "

15:59.990 --> 16:01.990
You weren't at
the Copper Palms.

16:02.490 --> 16:06.290
And there's an indication that
someone was injured there.

16:06.690 --> 16:08.190
Sorry.

16:08.390 --> 16:10.090
It's like I said,

16:10.290 --> 16:13.190
my tunes got stolen
out of my car last week.

16:13.790 --> 16:15.140
Ms. Sivarro...

16:15.175 --> 16:16.490
It's Anna.

16:16.790 --> 16:18.190
Anna...

16:18.890 --> 16:21.890
were you in the room with
Andy, Rob and Dennis?

16:21.925 --> 16:24.190
Did someone try and hurt you?

16:24.290 --> 16:25.990
Look, you can check me out.

16:27.490 --> 16:28.990
I don't have a mark on me.

16:30.390 --> 16:33.990
I'll do whatever you need
to prove that I wasn't there...

16:34.025 --> 16:36.157
fingerprints, blood.

16:36.192 --> 16:38.290
I would appreciate it.

16:40.290 --> 16:42.590
Look, you don't have to
protect me, Lieutenant.

16:42.625 --> 16:46.090
I hope you're right... Anna.

17:16.790 --> 17:18.454
We caught them
going north on 95.

17:18.490 --> 17:20.089
Looked like they were
heading out of town.

17:20.490 --> 17:23.290
So, you boys headed north?

17:24.890 --> 17:27.055
We wanted to inform
Dennis' family in person.

17:27.089 --> 17:30.090
Were you going to tell them about
the girl at the hotel last night?

17:30.125 --> 17:31.390
Going to have to wait.

17:31.990 --> 17:33.690
We need to search
your vehicle.

17:45.290 --> 17:46.290
Find something?

17:46.690 --> 17:48.490
Yeah, looks like blood.

18:09.590 --> 18:11.490
Pandora's box.

18:15.390 --> 18:16.855
So is this animal blood?

18:16.890 --> 18:19.390
Well, we'll know it
in a second.

18:23.990 --> 18:25.490
Oh, boy.

18:25.525 --> 18:26.990
Yeah.

18:28.990 --> 18:30.740
You gentlemen have a problem.

18:30.775 --> 18:32.490
The blood is
definitely human.

18:33.090 --> 18:34.155
I will take a polygraph.

18:34.190 --> 18:35.390
I don't know anything
about that.

18:35.425 --> 18:36.355
I will, too.

18:36.390 --> 18:38.690
Yeah, well, you're going to have to
take a ride with our officers first

18:38.890 --> 18:42.890
'cause we got a lot of questns to ask
you about what went on in thatotel room.

18:48.790 --> 18:50.090
Okay, so what now?

18:50.390 --> 18:52.590
Got some questions of
our own to answer first.

18:52.625 --> 18:53.555
Starting with

18:53.590 --> 18:56.290
how did human blood
get in this cooler?

18:58.490 --> 19:00.690
Were you ever away from your
clients during the hunt?

19:00.725 --> 19:01.690
No.

19:02.090 --> 19:03.555
The first day, I drove them out.

19:03.590 --> 19:05.990
And then this morning,
they asked to meet me.

19:06.025 --> 19:07.890
I thought that
was a little strange,

19:08.090 --> 19:09.855
but it saved me a trip
to South Beach.

19:09.890 --> 19:12.590
Is there any place along the road
where they could've dumped the body?

19:12.625 --> 19:14.107
At this end of the Glades,

19:14.142 --> 19:15.555
it's one way innd one way out.

19:15.590 --> 19:18.290
So you're saying that I'll need
to search the entire road.

19:18.490 --> 19:19.890
Maybe not.

19:20.790 --> 19:23.090
Did you tell me they all had
bear lure on their clothes?

19:23.125 --> 19:24.290
That's right.

19:24.390 --> 19:26.390
I only put the scent
in one spot.

19:27.190 --> 19:28.055
Great.

19:28.090 --> 19:29.290
You can show me.

19:40.190 --> 19:42.790
I put the lure
all over these trees.

20:01.890 --> 20:04.090
This must be the girl
from the hotel room.

20:16.890 --> 20:19.290
They must've thought the animals
would finish her off.

20:19.890 --> 20:21.990
Lucky for us,
they thought wrong.

20:37.290 --> 20:38.990
So, gentlemen...

20:39.190 --> 20:41.890
why don't u tell me what
happened in that hotel room.

20:42.490 --> 20:43.640
What do you mean?

20:43.675 --> 20:44.755
We just hung out.

20:44.790 --> 20:46.155
We drank, we played some cards.

20:46.190 --> 20:50.090
Was this before or after you dumped
the girl in the Everglades?

20:54.790 --> 20:55.990
I don't know
what you're talking about.

20:56.025 --> 20:58.190
We... we never...
Andy.

20:58.590 --> 20:59.355
Forget it.

20:59.390 --> 21:01.390
Dennis is dead. Why are
we still protecting him?

21:01.425 --> 21:02.557
Protecting him?

21:02.592 --> 21:03.791
How do you mean?

21:03.826 --> 21:04.990
Dennis is the one.

21:05.090 --> 21:06.890
He was wasted.
He wanted to party.

21:07.290 --> 21:08.355
Really party.

21:08.390 --> 21:09.390
Called for a stripper.

21:16.790 --> 21:18.340
And it was way
too intense for us,

21:18.375 --> 21:19.855
so we left to hit
a couple clubs

21:19.890 --> 21:21.990
and when we got back
it was alrdy over.

21:22.590 --> 21:23.690
What's wrong wi her?

21:28.390 --> 21:29.555
She's dead.

21:29.590 --> 21:31.190
What do you mean
she's dead?

21:31.990 --> 21:34.390
She went to the bathroom,
she came out,

21:34.425 --> 21:36.790
her nose was bleeding,
and she collapsed.

21:41.890 --> 21:43.390
So let me get this
straight, gentlemen.

21:43.425 --> 21:45.590
You're implicating
a dead man?

21:47.590 --> 21:48.690
It's true.

21:48.990 --> 21:50.590
Dennis killed her.

21:51.090 --> 21:54.090
We helped him move her,
but that was it.

21:54.890 --> 21:56.890
And moving a body
isn't a crime... I looked it up.

21:56.925 --> 21:58.890
You looked it up,
how studious of you.

21:58.990 --> 22:01.690
I'm charging you with
accessory after the fact.

22:01.725 --> 22:02.990
Look that up.

22:09.890 --> 22:11.490
Any ID on our dead girl?

22:11.590 --> 22:14.490
No, but I ran the blood you
collected from the hotel room.

22:14.525 --> 22:16.090
Does it match our female victim?

22:16.290 --> 22:17.355
The blood drops do,

22:17.390 --> 22:19.890
but the blood that came from
under the tile is from a male.

22:20.390 --> 22:22.890
Doesn't match our weekend
warriors or their instructor.

22:23.090 --> 22:24.690
How many people in that room?

22:24.990 --> 22:26.155
That I cannot answer.

22:26.190 --> 22:28.390
But I'm hoping to be able
to tell you who he was.

22:33.390 --> 22:34.590
Out of prison.

22:35.090 --> 22:37.390
He got right back
on the horse, didn't he?

22:37.690 --> 22:39.190
Pull up his current info

22:44.090 --> 22:46.390
The Pink Velvet Gentlemen's Club.

22:48.890 --> 22:50.290
Know where that is?

22:56.590 --> 22:57.690
Yeah, I know.

23:15.690 --> 23:16.690
Detectives.

23:16.890 --> 23:18.090
Joey Mazzaro.

23:18.290 --> 23:19.690
What can I help you with today?

23:20.290 --> 23:22.590
We need to ask you some
questions, Mr. Mazzaro.

23:22.625 --> 23:23.990
We're friends of the rce.

23:25.290 --> 23:26.555
We got enough friends.

23:26.590 --> 23:28.490
But I bet you want to know
who has enemies.

23:29.490 --> 23:30.790
Does he have enemies?

23:31.090 --> 23:32.790
Rocco's one of
my bodyguards here.

23:33.090 --> 23:35.590
He's an enemy of every guy
he won't let touch the girls.

23:36.190 --> 23:37.255
What about last night?

23:37.290 --> 23:39.990
He, uh, he get any threats?

23:40.290 --> 23:41.190
Nope.

23:41.390 --> 23:44.990
Sent him out on a private last night with
one of my dancers to the Copper Palms Hotel.

23:45.025 --> 23:46.190
I need to talk to him.

23:46.225 --> 23:47.255
Yeah, so do I.

23:47.290 --> 23:49.390
He hasn't checked in.
Neither has my girl.

23:49.990 --> 23:51.590
Well, I wouldn't expect
a call from her.

23:52.290 --> 23:52.955
Why's that?

23:52.990 --> 23:55.490
We may have found her body
dumped in the Glades.

23:55.890 --> 23:56.855
Anna's dead?

23:56.890 --> 23:58.390
Did you say Anna?

23:59.190 --> 24:00.590
Yeah. Anna Sivarro.

24:00.790 --> 24:01.855
New kid.

24:01.890 --> 24:04.490
Shows some real talent.

24:05.691 --> 24:06.691
She certainly does...

24:20.490 --> 24:21.990
Anna, you lied to me.

24:23.490 --> 24:25.690
You were in that
hotel room last night.

24:26.490 --> 24:27.490
I wasn't.

24:28.590 --> 24:30.190
I was supposed to be.

24:30.390 --> 24:32.190
But I gave the job to Tess.

24:39.090 --> 24:40.690
Is that Tess?

24:46.490 --> 24:47.590
Yeah.

24:48.790 --> 24:50.390
That's Tess Gowan.

24:51.390 --> 24:52.555
You gave the job to Tess

24:52.590 --> 24:54.790
because you knew whoever went
would be in danger.

24:54.825 --> 24:56.090
No.

24:56.990 --> 24:58.690
I swear.

24:59.390 --> 25:01.390
Look, it was just a job.

25:02.090 --> 25:04.355
I even gave her my music.

25:04.390 --> 25:06.290
Why didn't you want
to go to work?

25:07.590 --> 25:09.590
I was at a recording studio,

25:09.625 --> 25:11.590
trying to put together my demo.

25:11.625 --> 25:12.890
Your demo?

25:13.190 --> 25:15.190
Well, that's grt.
Now you're an artist?

25:16.590 --> 25:17.490
Frank.

25:17.590 --> 25:19.190
Give me a minute, will you?

25:20.190 --> 25:21.690
Yeah.

25:27.790 --> 25:29.490
Anna, tell me what happened.

25:31.190 --> 25:32.890
I've been waiting
for some studio time,

25:32.925 --> 25:34.790
so I can record some music.

25:36.490 --> 25:37.555
An opening came up,

25:37.590 --> 25:40.790
so I asked Tess
if she could cover for me.

25:41.690 --> 25:43.590
When my session
was over, I...

25:44.090 --> 25:45.490
I called her.

25:46.390 --> 25:48.590
When she didn't answer,
I got worried.

25:48.890 --> 25:51.090
Okay. And so you went
to the hotel.

25:51.390 --> 25:52.690
To check on her, yes.

25:52.725 --> 25:54.190
What'd you see?

25:57.490 --> 25:59.190
A man.

26:02.890 --> 26:03.990
It was dark,

26:04.190 --> 26:06.390
so I really couldn't
make out his face.

26:09.790 --> 26:11.990
He was carrying a body
in a rug.

26:16.690 --> 26:19.790
I knew from the tattoo
that it was Rocco.

26:23.490 --> 26:24.355
I knew that if
Rocco was dead,

26:24.390 --> 26:27.090
something horrible must
have happened to Tess.

26:27.390 --> 26:29.490
I got scared, so I ran.

26:29.890 --> 26:31.490
Anna, why didn't...

26:31.690 --> 26:33.690
why didn't you
mention this before?

26:35.090 --> 26:37.290
'Cause I don't trust cops.

26:38.290 --> 26:41.290
Anna, you need to trust me.

26:41.690 --> 26:43.090
All right?

26:56.090 --> 26:57.155
What can I help you with?

26:57.190 --> 27:00.390
Alexx is taking a long time to
document all the animal activity.

27:00.425 --> 27:02.755
Well, we need to find
the bodyguard's bo.

27:02.790 --> 27:05.590
And according to Anna,
it was transported in a rug.

27:05.625 --> 27:07.707
Well, Tripp's cadets
are searching the area

27:07.742 --> 27:09.755
where we recoved Tess's body
as we speak.

27:09.790 --> 27:12.890
Yeah, but that cooler is too
small to transport two bodie

27:13.690 --> 27:15.890
I think the bodyguard
was dumped somewhere else.

27:16.090 --> 27:18.690
You think they used the rug from
the hotel room and put it back?

27:18.725 --> 27:21.655
Yeah, that's why
I'm examining it right now.

27:21.690 --> 27:23.990
Hm. Well, in that case, trace on the
rug could lead us to the body.

27:24.025 --> 27:24.990
You found anything?

27:25.490 --> 27:28.890
Oh, yeah, plant material
from a Roystonea regia.

27:29.790 --> 27:30.790
What's that?

27:30.990 --> 27:32.155
It's a palm tree.

27:32.190 --> 27:34.890
Well, that doesn't exactly
narrow the search.

27:38.390 --> 27:39.990
This insect might.

27:42.490 --> 27:43.355
What is it?

27:43.390 --> 27:45.690
It's a royal palm bug.

27:46.490 --> 27:49.490
And, uh, and how does that he us?

27:49.890 --> 27:52.290
Well, seeing as they only live
in the palm trees,

27:52.325 --> 27:53.355
at least 12 feet in the air,

27:53.390 --> 27:55.090
what's this little guy
doing on the ground?

27:55.490 --> 27:58.390
This plant material has a clean,
mechanized looking cut.

27:58.425 --> 28:00.255
Maybe the palms
were being trimmed.

28:00.290 --> 28:02.790
If we can find some
freshly cut royal palms,

28:02.825 --> 28:04.557
maybe we can find
our dump site.

28:04.592 --> 28:06.255
And I think I know
where to start...

28:06.290 --> 28:08.790
they were cutting palms when
I was there this morning.

28:22.390 --> 28:23.090
Ryan!

28:31.390 --> 28:33.790
Guess he didn't make it
very far from the hotel, did he?

28:34.390 --> 28:35.890
I'm sure someone wanted
to get rid of the body

28:35.925 --> 28:37.590
before anyone discovered it.

28:47.990 --> 28:49.640
There are at lea
five stab wounds here.

28:49.675 --> 28:51.290
Yeah, and this
shower liner explains

28:51.325 --> 28:53.090
why no blood
got on the rug.

28:56.290 --> 28:57.790
Fiber from the rug?

28:58.890 --> 29:00.290
No, I don't thinso.

29:00.490 --> 29:02.090
The rug was light green.

29:08.790 --> 29:09.990
It's a feather.

29:10.590 --> 29:12.590
Yeah, it's a feather from a duck.

29:13.590 --> 29:15.155
Wait a minute, you're
saying that first of all

29:15.190 --> 29:18.090
there was a killer bear,
and now there's a killer duck?

29:18.990 --> 29:22.755
I'm saying the fiber you found
on Rocco's body was eider duck.

29:22.790 --> 29:26.290
It's used as fill in the most expensive,
high-quality down jackets.

29:26.325 --> 29:29.090
Our dead hunter was wearing
a down-filled vest.

29:29.190 --> 29:32.190
But here's the interesting thing
the bear shredded this vest,

29:32.225 --> 29:33.890
but I don't thin he did this.

29:35.190 --> 29:36.690
It's been cut.

29:37.190 --> 29:37.955
Okay.

29:37.990 --> 29:39.955
All three of our hunters
had knives.

29:39.990 --> 29:43.790
Mm-hmm. The other two guys didn't
have any cuts or tears in their jackets.

29:44.590 --> 29:47.190
So his own knife
cut the vest on the way out.

29:47.890 --> 29:51.090
And Rocco had to be close enough
to get the feathers on him.

30:08.390 --> 30:09.890
Dennis killed the bodyguard.

30:12.190 --> 30:14.755
Andy and Rob were telling
the truth about Dennis.

30:14.790 --> 30:17.090
So the dead guy is a murderer,
but we still haven't confirmed

30:17.125 --> 30:18.455
who killed Tess Gowan.

30:18.490 --> 30:20.090
I'm going to pay Alexx a visit.

30:52.990 --> 30:54.590
Lieutenant, I've got
a business to run.

30:55.790 --> 30:58.490
Yes, you do, and that
business is pandering, Joey.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.090
I employ strippers,

31:00.390 --> 31:03.190
and I don't encourage them
to do anything more than that.

31:03.225 --> 31:05.990
No, you may not, but either
way, you get a cut, don't you?

31:07.490 --> 31:09.490
As long as they pay,
I don't ask.

31:09.525 --> 31:11.490
Where's Anna?
You just missed her.

31:11.525 --> 31:12.690
I got her out on a private.

31:12.725 --> 31:14.090
Where'd you send her?

31:14.890 --> 31:16.190
Can't tell you.

31:16.590 --> 31:18.690
He's one of those clits
in high places.

31:19.290 --> 31:20.655
He was a regular for Tess.

31:20.690 --> 31:21.990
Now that she's gone,
I sent Anna.

31:22.025 --> 31:23.355
She should like it.

31:23.390 --> 31:26.290
He pays ten large
for a private lap dance.

31:26.390 --> 31:27.255
You and I both know

31:27.290 --> 31:30.590
that nobody pays $10,000
to watch, do they?

31:31.090 --> 31:32.790
Lieutenant, you're
so sure I'm a pimp...

31:32.825 --> 31:34.307
what does that make Anna?

31:34.342 --> 31:35.790
Why don't you tell me.

31:36.290 --> 31:38.890
Everything I do
is legal, Lieutenant.

31:39.590 --> 31:41.290
I don't have
to tell you anything,

31:41.790 --> 31:43.390
and you can't do
a thing about it.

31:43.425 --> 31:45.790
That is where you're wrong.

31:51.890 --> 31:52.690
Yeah, Frank.

31:52.691 --> 31:55.391
I need an address and I need it quick.

32:06.990 --> 32:08.990
Tell room service
leave it on the table.

32:09.390 --> 32:10.790
Get back in here

32:16.590 --> 32:17.690
What do you want?

32:21.390 --> 32:23.490
Supervisor O'Shay.

32:27.590 --> 32:29.290
MDPD.

32:29.890 --> 32:32.190
I'll call your director;
we'll work this out.

32:33.590 --> 32:36.790
Supervisor, I have a source
that says you're up here

32:36.825 --> 32:39.490
paying women $10,000 for s.

32:41.190 --> 32:44.190
Well, you see,
this is our first date,

32:44.225 --> 32:46.090
we haven't done
anything, so...

32:47.190 --> 32:50.490
If you're trying to entrap me,
it's not going to work.

32:52.990 --> 32:56.490
Ma'am, did the supervisor
pay you for sex?

33:10.490 --> 33:11.990
You're a lieutenant.

33:12.490 --> 33:14.390
That means you're a smart man.

33:15.590 --> 33:17.690
Then you understand my conflict.

33:17.890 --> 33:20.390
This is clearly
solicitation, Supervisor.

33:20.590 --> 33:22.790
And you realize you're
never going to make captain

33:22.890 --> 33:25.390
if you go ahead with this.

33:26.090 --> 33:27.590
You're making a career move.

33:27.625 --> 33:28.990
So are you.

33:38.190 --> 33:39.490
See you later, honey.

33:53.390 --> 33:54.590
Are you okay?

33:59.790 --> 34:01.390
Joey said that I owed him.

34:01.890 --> 34:03.590
He's blaming me for Tess.

34:03.625 --> 34:05.290
He made me meet this guy.

34:09.190 --> 34:10.690
I believe you.

34:27.489 --> 34:31.389
She has a fractured sternum,
associated spinal injuries.

34:31.790 --> 34:34.889
Something heavy
compressed her chest.

34:34.925 --> 34:36.290
Like a person?

34:37.190 --> 34:40.590
Based on the shape of the congestion
and cyanosis,

34:40.625 --> 34:44.190
related confluent
petechiae... then yeah.

34:44.225 --> 34:45.590
He sat on her.

34:55.790 --> 34:57.940
COD was positional asphyxia.

34:57.975 --> 35:00.055
Now it doesn't happen quick,

35:00.090 --> 35:02.540
so she suggled for
a couple of minutes.

35:02.575 --> 35:04.782
He had to have known
she was suffocating.

35:04.817 --> 35:06.990
Well, that wasn't the
only thing he did.

35:07.090 --> 35:08.590
I took an oral swab.

35:10.890 --> 35:13.790
Semen doesn't live long
in the mouth of a live person

35:13.825 --> 35:15.390
beuse of saliva, does it?

35:15.490 --> 35:19.090
If that's positive,
it was the last thing she did.

35:19.290 --> 35:21.290
If it's positive,
we have our killer.

35:34.290 --> 35:35.990
Why isn't Rob in here?

35:36.190 --> 35:39.590
Because he didn't kill Tess Gowan.
You did that all by yourself.

35:39.625 --> 35:40.290
Well...

35:41.790 --> 35:43.590
did Rob try to put this on me?

35:43.625 --> 35:45.557
Did... did he say something?

35:45.592 --> 35:47.490
No. Your DNA said it all.

35:52.290 --> 35:53.990
Okay, okay, okay.

35:55.090 --> 35:56.690
Okay, listen, you've got
to know this whole thing...

35:56.725 --> 35:57.890
it was just an
accident, okay?

35:57.925 --> 35:58.990
She...
Look.

35:59.190 --> 36:00.290
I don't want to hear it.

36:00.790 --> 36:02.155
It was not an accident.

36:02.190 --> 36:04.090
Tess struggled
under your weight,

36:04.125 --> 36:05.990
fighting for air, okay?

36:07.990 --> 36:09.190
You're too heavy.

36:09.990 --> 36:11.790
Get off me.
Stop, stop.

36:21.190 --> 36:22.690
I got carried away.

36:22.790 --> 36:23.955
You raped and killed her.

36:23.990 --> 36:26.290
How come Rob and Dennis
didn't try and stop you?

36:26.890 --> 36:28.290
They were passed out.

36:29.090 --> 36:30.890
Too many vodka shots.

36:30.990 --> 36:32.390
They woke up
and freaked out.

36:33.790 --> 36:35.690
Oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God.

36:35.725 --> 36:36.990
What did you do?

36:37.090 --> 36:38.390
I didn't do anything, man.

36:38.425 --> 36:39.690
She j... she just died.

36:41.190 --> 36:41.755
It's thbodyguard.

36:41.790 --> 36:43.390
Just... go tell him she left.

36:43.425 --> 36:44.590
Tell him she left.

36:46.290 --> 36:47.990
But Denny killed the bodyguard.

36:48.190 --> 36:49.690
And then you all
covered it up together.

36:51.790 --> 36:55.790
It would have worked if Denny
hadn't grown a conscience.

36:58.990 --> 37:00.590
I- I think we hould go
to the cops.

37:01.090 --> 37:01.755
You crazy, man?

37:01.790 --> 37:03.155
They fry in this state.

37:03.190 --> 37:04.540
I don't think
I can do this, guys,

37:04.575 --> 37:05.890
you know, even if we don't get caught.

37:05.925 --> 37:06.790
Hey.

37:07.390 --> 37:09.790
It's not just you
who's going down here.

37:09.890 --> 37:11.190
We're friends.

37:11.225 --> 37:12.490
We stick together.

37:12.890 --> 37:15.390
That's when Rob and I knew
we had to get rid of Dennis.

37:16.290 --> 37:17.790
Rob wanted to shoot him.

37:18.090 --> 37:20.890
Wanted it to look like
a hunting accident.

37:21.690 --> 37:23.190
Bear saved us the trouble.

37:24.390 --> 37:25.890
Well, actually,
the bear ruined it for you.

37:25.925 --> 37:27.390
If it hadn't have been
for the bear attack,

37:27.425 --> 37:28.990
you might have
gotten away with it.

37:29.890 --> 37:31.790
But I, f one,
am very glad you didn't.

37:43.690 --> 37:46.290
Clearing a path
for Supervisor O'Shay, Rick?

37:46.890 --> 37:49.490
It's not really a surprise the
brass cut him loose on this.

37:49.525 --> 37:51.590
You know how
these things work.

37:51.990 --> 37:53.490
All too well.

37:53.790 --> 37:55.555
So you're going
to fix the system

37:55.590 --> 37:58.290
by confronting him
as he walks out of jail?

38:00.890 --> 38:03.390
He took the same oath we did,
didn't he?

38:05.490 --> 38:07.555
I know he hired a prostitute,

38:07.590 --> 38:10.290
but you ought to save this
battle for something bigger.

38:10.325 --> 38:13.690
Rick, I am not letting this go.

38:16.590 --> 38:18.590
If this goes down,
I can't help you.

38:18.990 --> 38:20.690
Just like old tis, huh?

38:25.590 --> 38:27.355
And move that golf tournament
to the end of the month.

38:27.390 --> 38:30.390
Yes, I wouldn't make plans
that far in advance, Supervisor.

38:30.425 --> 38:31.290
Caine.

38:32.190 --> 38:34.440
Hope you're not here asking
fomore funds, Lieutenant.

38:34.475 --> 38:36.690
Not feeling that generous
towards your lab these days.

38:36.725 --> 38:37.655
It's a pity

38:37.690 --> 38:40.290
because I have an idea
for a new project.

38:40.690 --> 38:42.990
Wish I could help, but
the budget's a bit tight.

38:43.025 --> 38:44.990
Might even have to
have a few cutbacks.

38:45.590 --> 38:48.290
Stay away from Anna Sivarro.

38:51.090 --> 38:53.355
How did you get this far
in your career, Caine?

38:53.390 --> 38:55.990
You really want to
throw it all away over a girl like tt?

38:58.190 --> 39:00.390
You know what I'm curious
about, Supervisor?

39:00.425 --> 39:02.590
How an elected official
like you affords

39:02.625 --> 39:05.390
$10,000 for a dance.

39:06.090 --> 39:08.090
I think we're done
here, Lieutenant.

39:08.890 --> 39:13.090
I sincerely hope so
for your sake, Supervisor.

39:16.590 --> 39:18.490
I reallyo.

39:43.290 --> 39:44.890
Thanks for meeting me here.

39:45.590 --> 39:46.890
Of course.

39:49.090 --> 39:50.890
So you got Tess's killer?

39:51.590 --> 39:53.990
That's right; we arrested
him this afternoon.

39:54.990 --> 39:56.290
Good, good.

39:57.590 --> 39:59.490
Tess's mom will be glad.

40:02.090 --> 40:03.590
How about you?

40:06.490 --> 40:09.190
I'm still feeling guilty
about Tess.

40:11.390 --> 40:14.490
Anna, this is not your fault.

40:16.190 --> 40:17.590
I know.

40:22.690 --> 40:25.240
Something lls me
you don't buy that either

40:25.275 --> 40:27.790
when you try telling that
to yourself.

40:31.490 --> 40:33.990
I heard they let
the big shot go.

40:35.490 --> 40:37.090
That's true.

40:37.290 --> 40:40.990
They did, but he will
not bother you again.

40:44.890 --> 40:47.790
You really do believe all that
protect and serve stuff,

40:47.825 --> 40:49.290
don't you?

40:52.990 --> 40:54.890
It's the only thing...

40:55.090 --> 40:57.990
the only thing
that I know how to do.
