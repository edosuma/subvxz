[seagulls screeching]

00:23.000 --> 00:23.875
[screeches]

00:40.375 --> 00:41.291
[Hassan] Hey, Warren.

00:42.125 --> 00:43.041
Come here.

00:45.791 --> 00:47.833
Hey. Would you tell
the mayor and Miss Keane

00:47.916 --> 00:50.458
to keep off the shoreline
unless they have gloves and galoshes?

00:50.541 --> 00:52.041
-I'll be over directly.
-[Warren] Yeah.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.833
Hey, Mr. Mayor, Sheriff says to
keep off the shoreline unless you've got--

00:58.916 --> 01:01.291
-What's he saying? What happened?
-Give me your, um…

01:01.375 --> 01:03.166
See these ladies off the beach,
would you, Warren?

01:03.250 --> 01:05.375
Wade, we need to talk about this.

01:05.458 --> 01:06.708
-[Wade] In a bit.
-[Bev] We've got…

01:07.375 --> 01:10.916
Sweet boy, no need. I can walk
on a beach just fine. Thank you.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.500
You'll have your say, Bev.

01:13.166 --> 01:14.916
Lord knows you always do. Sheriff!

01:15.750 --> 01:16.791
Mornin'.

01:16.875 --> 01:19.833
I thought I said… You should stay back
till I know more, Mr. Mayor.

01:19.916 --> 01:22.333
It could be this is
some kinda disease or infection.

01:22.416 --> 01:25.791
You know, I remember 2002,
whole flock of, uh…

01:26.416 --> 01:28.125
Starlings. It was starlings.

01:28.208 --> 01:30.666
Hundreds of 'em just fell
out of the sky, covered the beach.

01:30.750 --> 01:32.541
The whole town. The square too.

01:32.625 --> 01:35.125
Never did get a satisfying answer.
Lots of theories.

01:35.208 --> 01:38.833
Lightning, noises, disease.
Never did find out.

01:38.916 --> 01:41.083
Whole pod of dolphins once too,
on the west bank.

01:41.166 --> 01:43.666
More than a dozen,
and they had bites missing.

01:43.750 --> 01:46.208
And now here we are again.
What in the world?

01:47.666 --> 01:50.500
-They washed up from the Uppards, right?
-Yeah, looks like.

01:51.166 --> 01:52.375
They drowned, right?

01:53.041 --> 01:54.541
The Uppards haven't flooded in,

01:54.625 --> 01:58.125
well, 20 years or more,
but that storm, wowzers.

01:58.208 --> 01:59.333
[Hassan] Maybe.

01:59.416 --> 02:02.791
But you said some kind of disease
or infection? You think so?

02:03.625 --> 02:05.791
But you don't see any oil now, do you?

02:06.791 --> 02:08.166
Well, here, look.

02:09.166 --> 02:10.750
-Try not to get too close.
-[Wade] Yep.

02:10.833 --> 02:13.250
[Hassan] Don't want to
pick up parasites. Here.

02:15.500 --> 02:16.666
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:16.750 --> 02:18.750
Nah, no oil.

02:19.250 --> 02:21.416
That's something, anyway.
You should have seen…

02:21.500 --> 02:25.625
Well, folks around here, they seen some
horrible things wash up after the spill.

02:26.166 --> 02:28.875
But you'd see it, you know.
You'd smell it for sure. So that's…

02:29.833 --> 02:32.458
That's somethin' isn't it?
That's a relief, anyway.

02:32.541 --> 02:35.000
[Hassan] The neck's broke.
Ripped up a bit.

02:35.083 --> 02:37.250
Yeah, the gulls have been
at 'em all morning.

02:37.333 --> 02:38.958
[Hassan] All right,
but that's the thing though.

02:39.458 --> 02:43.000
There's no blood. Anywhere.
In the cats, or on the beach.

02:43.083 --> 02:46.208
So I think it happened before they got
in the water or in the water maybe.

02:46.291 --> 02:48.041
Yeah. A predator, huh?

02:49.041 --> 02:52.375
Ospreys maybe? Or some kind of shark?

02:52.458 --> 02:54.833
Maybe lots of baby sharks. I don't know.

02:54.916 --> 02:57.333
You know, we used to
have those before the…

02:57.416 --> 03:00.166
Haven't seen many around,
you know, but maybe that's it.

03:00.250 --> 03:01.625
Maybe the sharks are coming back.

03:01.708 --> 03:03.541
And that wouldn't
necessarily be a bad thing,

03:03.625 --> 03:06.958
because where there's sharks,
there's fish, right?

03:07.041 --> 03:09.291
You know, being new around here, I, uh…

03:09.375 --> 03:11.875
I wouldn't know what sort of wildlife
you have on the island.

03:11.958 --> 03:14.166
"You"? It's your island too, Sheriff.

03:14.250 --> 03:17.250
We have on the island.
So I put it to Ed Flynn.

03:17.333 --> 03:19.833
-Yeah? He out here?
-Yeah, he's been out here all morning.

03:19.916 --> 03:22.041
He says ospreys could get
one or two on a good day,

03:22.125 --> 03:23.958
but this many, it's unlikely.

03:24.041 --> 03:26.333
Maybe it was the cats themselves.
Maybe they fought.

03:26.416 --> 03:28.750
The Uppards is like
Lord of the Flies for those cats.

03:28.833 --> 03:30.375
Spooked by the storm or whatnot.

03:30.458 --> 03:31.791
-He only had one.
-[Wade] What's this?

03:31.875 --> 03:33.250
He said he'd send more if we need.

03:33.333 --> 03:34.875
Oh, we're gonna need.
Did you tell him how many?

03:34.958 --> 03:36.291
I didn't know how many.

03:36.375 --> 03:39.958
He thinks there's a few cats on the beach.
Tell him it's hundreds. You know what?

03:40.041 --> 03:41.958
-Tell him to come down here.
-What's this now?

03:42.041 --> 03:43.791
I figured we'd burn them
in case there's disease.

03:43.875 --> 03:45.000
Get 'em in a pile and burn 'em.

03:45.083 --> 03:47.250
Keep people back,
'cause if you think it smells bad now--

03:47.333 --> 03:49.208
-Hang on a bit, okay?
-I'll go get more.

03:49.291 --> 03:50.583
Just tell him to come down here!

03:50.666 --> 03:52.708
I don't think the folks
are gonna much like that.

03:52.791 --> 03:55.625
That seems a little drastic.
We've had strange things happen before.

03:55.708 --> 03:59.125
Hey, look. It's public safety. Really.
And they'll thank you for it.

03:59.208 --> 04:01.541
Their mayor isn't willing
to gamble with public health.

04:05.500 --> 04:07.666
Hey, you know,
that's a good kid you got there.

04:07.750 --> 04:09.541
It's a good kid, lending a hand like that.

04:10.125 --> 04:13.333
Yeah, he, uh…
Well, he wants to be a part of things.

04:13.416 --> 04:15.375
Well, that's a good instinct.
A place like this,

04:15.458 --> 04:18.583
someone tries to stay separate
or isolated, it just hurts the whole…

04:20.250 --> 04:23.583
We really would love to see
you two in mass one of these days.

04:23.666 --> 04:25.333
Not as a convert, mind you. No, no, no.

04:25.416 --> 04:27.500
You've got your faith,
and, well, God bless.

04:27.583 --> 04:30.791
Nothing but respect.
And I know that you hop the ferry

04:30.875 --> 04:33.750
and you spend your Sundays
on mainland for mosque, but--

04:33.833 --> 04:34.833
Fridays.

04:34.916 --> 04:37.625
Oh, Fridays? Then you're here Sundays,
which is perfect.

04:37.708 --> 04:39.916
You know, I think it would pay dividends
with the community

04:40.000 --> 04:41.375
if you put in an appearance.

04:41.458 --> 04:44.125
Maybe did a reading,
help announcements, nothing major.

04:44.208 --> 04:46.125
You don't have to sign up
for membership or anything,

04:46.208 --> 04:48.375
just show the people you're here,
part of the whole.

04:48.458 --> 04:50.125
You know what I'm sayin', right, Sheriff?

04:50.208 --> 04:51.541
Yeah, I think we burn 'em!

04:52.708 --> 04:55.125
-[Ed] Makes sense. Better safe.
-[Hassan] Yeah?

04:55.208 --> 04:57.625
[Hassan] Get some gas, dig a pit,
get some sand around 'em.

04:57.708 --> 04:58.958
Mornin', Ed.

04:59.041 --> 05:02.250
Riley. Wowzers, you ever seen
something like this, huh?

05:02.333 --> 05:05.750
And natural causes, not the spill,
mind you, but this is natural causes.

05:05.833 --> 05:07.791
You know, I remember 2002 it was,

05:07.875 --> 05:10.583
a whole flock of starlings
just fell outta the sky.

05:10.666 --> 05:12.041
Yeah, some storm.

05:12.833 --> 05:16.041
Riley was out in it,
but he didn't see any cats on the beach.

05:16.125 --> 05:18.875
-You were out here during the storm?
-Why the hell would you do that?

05:18.958 --> 05:21.500
I saw… I thought I saw something.

05:21.583 --> 05:23.375
Yeah. Monsignor Pruitt.

05:23.458 --> 05:25.750
-[chuckles] What?
-I don't… I don't know what I saw.

05:25.833 --> 05:28.291
-You said you were sure last night.
-Well, I don't know.

05:28.375 --> 05:31.041
-Well, he's on the mainland.
-Yes, I know.

05:31.125 --> 05:34.833
So then maybe you saw someone else?
Someone doing somethin' to these cats?

05:34.916 --> 05:37.291
No, I didn't see any cats.
I think, anyway.

05:37.375 --> 05:39.041
I wasn't lookin' at the breakers.

05:40.125 --> 05:43.166
How you doing, Riley?
How's it treatin' you, being back?

05:44.125 --> 05:46.333
Prayed for you every week.
We certainly did.

05:46.416 --> 05:49.333
Yeah. Uh, thanks. It's fine.

05:51.291 --> 05:52.208
Morning!

05:53.625 --> 05:55.708
Morning yourself. Jesus.

05:55.791 --> 05:58.333
Yeah. I wouldn't get too close.

05:58.416 --> 06:01.833
I read this thing somewhere
about cats and pregnant people.

06:02.333 --> 06:04.916
-Pregnant women, I guess.
-Yeah. Tend to be women.

06:05.625 --> 06:08.041
Toxo-something.
There's this parasite in cat shit

06:08.125 --> 06:09.458
that can be bad for pregnant women.

06:09.541 --> 06:12.916
Toxoplasmosis.
It's kind of a myth, really.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.791
More likely to get it from gardening.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.958
All right, well… Lotta cats.
Better safe, you know?

06:18.041 --> 06:21.333
What happened? This really looks like
every stray from the Uppards.

06:21.416 --> 06:23.083
Yeah. They're just gonna burn 'em all.

06:24.708 --> 06:25.541
Uh…

06:26.166 --> 06:30.958
Hey, sorry about last night.
I just wanted to apologize.

06:31.041 --> 06:32.000
What for?

06:32.083 --> 06:35.041
For unloading on you like that.
It won't happen again.

06:35.125 --> 06:38.416
It's fine. And look, it all worked out.
You found your purpose.

06:38.500 --> 06:41.541
-Yeah, cat disposal.
-You gotta start somewhere.

06:42.208 --> 06:45.291
Wild night. I swear I saw…

06:46.541 --> 06:49.541
You know how Monsignor Pruitt
always wears that coat and hat?

06:49.625 --> 06:50.791
Yeah, I guess so.

06:50.875 --> 06:52.375
All right, last night I saw…

06:54.333 --> 06:58.208
Uh… Never mind. He's on the mainland.
I'm just… It's crazy.

07:02.083 --> 07:03.166
[sighs]

07:03.250 --> 07:08.083
Well, I guess I'd better start burning
these cats. Got a boat to catch.

07:09.125 --> 07:11.916
-Greener pastures already?
-Nah, I got a meeting.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.375
-Something good?
-No, it's…

07:16.083 --> 07:17.458
Stay away from the cats, all right?

07:17.541 --> 07:20.666
I don't want you catchin'
toxo-cat-mosis or whatever.

07:20.750 --> 07:22.000
Don't tell me what to do.

Where were you before this?

Lots of gossips in our parish.

10:23.500 --> 10:24.500
Like, lots.

10:24.583 --> 10:27.291
I'd be happy to tell them
if they'd ask me. But…

10:27.375 --> 10:29.708
Well, that's the thing
about where we've been.

10:29.791 --> 10:31.208
It's important, sure.

10:31.291 --> 10:33.375
But it's not as important
as where we're going.

10:33.875 --> 10:36.250
And every place I was
before where I am now,

10:36.333 --> 10:38.875
well, they were just leading me here.

10:38.958 --> 10:42.125
Even if I didn't know it at the time.
Even if I didn't see it.

10:42.791 --> 10:44.375
It's kind of like you.

10:45.625 --> 10:47.250
I've lived here my whole life.

10:47.333 --> 10:50.625
Sure, but there was a before for you too.

10:51.250 --> 10:53.250
It was pointing you here,
and you know what that is?

10:53.333 --> 10:56.583
That's pointing us where we're going,
whether we know it or not?

10:57.791 --> 10:58.750
It's God.

10:59.416 --> 11:02.583
He was pointing you here
the same way He was pointing me here.

11:10.750 --> 11:11.583
Morning!

11:12.666 --> 11:13.666

11:15.500 --> 11:16.833

11:19.958 --> 11:20.833
[Father Paul] You all right?

11:23.541 --> 11:24.500
Leeza?

11:25.333 --> 11:26.333
Oh, I'm fine.

11:27.416 --> 11:28.291
It's fine.

12:03.625 --> 12:05.083
Erin. [chuckles nervously]

12:06.250 --> 12:09.375
-You surprised me. What do you need?
-The Windex.

12:09.458 --> 12:14.000
Did you try adding a bit of water to it?
Usually, you can get more out that way.

12:14.083 --> 12:17.375
I already threw out the bottle.
But I'll try that next time.

12:17.458 --> 12:21.875
You know, your mother
used to put back the empties,

12:22.541 --> 12:24.250
right back into this closet.

12:24.333 --> 12:27.291
Half of them filled
with nothing but water sometimes.

12:27.375 --> 12:28.791
She was so against waste.

12:29.541 --> 12:33.625
I'd have to throw them out myself.
I would say, "Peggy. Peggy Greene,

12:33.708 --> 12:36.458
you are going to bury us
in bottles if you keep it up."

12:37.500 --> 12:40.416
And here you threw it away.

12:41.875 --> 12:43.625
Isn't that just a gas?

12:45.708 --> 12:49.875
You know, it is funny, because at home,
she never met a bottle she couldn't empty.

12:54.416 --> 12:55.375
Here you go.

12:59.833 --> 13:02.333
-What's that for?
-Ugh, rats.

13:03.333 --> 13:05.458
Had a big problem after the spill.

13:06.666 --> 13:08.791
The rats came upon us like locusts.

13:08.875 --> 13:11.708
I guess their regular
food source was polluted.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.083
No fish to eat at the marina,

13:13.166 --> 13:15.291
so they were
in every pantry on the island.

13:15.375 --> 13:20.708
This works like a charm.
But with what happened with those cats…

13:21.708 --> 13:24.666
If there are some wild animals
out there responsible,

13:24.750 --> 13:27.333
some kind of predator on the island,

13:27.416 --> 13:30.541
what did that
to those poor kittens? Well, this…

13:31.541 --> 13:35.125
I plan to just sprinkle a little bit
outside the house, just to be safe.

13:36.916 --> 13:39.625
I could do your house
as well, if you like.

13:39.708 --> 13:41.250
Oh, no. I'll be fine.

13:41.916 --> 13:43.708
Of course you will, dear.

13:50.625 --> 13:51.458
[knocking on door]

13:55.166 --> 13:56.000
[Sarah] Oh.

13:57.125 --> 13:58.166
Sarah.

13:58.250 --> 14:00.250
Yes. Sarah Gunning.

14:01.416 --> 14:04.125
You're… I've heard about you, Father.

14:04.208 --> 14:05.458
Paul. Hill.

14:07.458 --> 14:08.666
What can I do for you?

14:08.750 --> 14:11.750
I'm sure you've heard
that I'm taking over for Monsignor.

14:12.375 --> 14:13.416
I have.

14:13.500 --> 14:16.291
He told me something
as we were discussing the congregation.

14:16.375 --> 14:19.375
Your mother… He said prior
to her health declining…

14:19.458 --> 14:25.041
Prior to that, that she never missed mass.
Not even daily mass. Is that right?

14:25.750 --> 14:26.875
My mother is…

14:27.708 --> 14:29.583
Was very devout.

14:30.958 --> 14:32.791
Well, here's the thing…

14:33.833 --> 14:35.625
[Sarah] Mom, someone's here to see you.

14:38.833 --> 14:40.708
-John?
-[Sarah] No.

14:41.208 --> 14:44.208
She thinks you're Monsignor Pruitt.
Sorry, she gets confused.

14:44.291 --> 14:46.666
-That's an easy mistake, same tailor.
-[chuckles]

14:47.833 --> 14:49.333
Mom, this is Father Paul.

14:49.416 --> 14:53.500
Monsignor Pruitt is away
for a while, and he came to…

14:54.250 --> 14:57.541
Well, I've come
to celebrate mass, young lady.

14:59.041 --> 15:00.083
Ah…

15:14.791 --> 15:17.416
I'll be in there in my office
if you need anything.

15:17.500 --> 15:20.125
If she starts to have
an episode, come get me.

15:20.208 --> 15:21.083
[Father Paul] Of course.

15:38.666 --> 15:41.916
"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,
and the love of God,

15:42.000 --> 15:44.583
and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
be with you all."

16:02.083 --> 16:03.541
Body of Christ, Millie.

16:10.541 --> 16:11.791
Blood of Christ.

16:39.125 --> 16:41.833
Are you really walking by
without saying hi?

16:42.833 --> 16:45.291
[Riley] Uh, I didn't want to bother you.

16:46.083 --> 16:48.166
[Erin] You're very considerate. Um…

16:48.791 --> 16:51.583
-Do you want some tea?
-No, I'm just heading back.

16:52.583 --> 16:53.750
How was your day?

16:57.541 --> 17:00.708
Wow. It's been a long time
since anyone asked me that.

17:00.791 --> 17:02.291
In prison nobody asks?

17:03.416 --> 17:06.333
No, in prison no one needs to ask.
Every day is exactly the same.

17:09.083 --> 17:10.333
How was your day?

17:11.833 --> 17:13.583
[Erin] Honestly, it was dull.

17:14.833 --> 17:16.833
Do you want my routine?
I'll give it away cheap.

17:16.916 --> 17:20.166
Cheap? Well, it better be
'cause I'm literally broke.

17:20.875 --> 17:21.833
You got a pitch?

17:22.500 --> 17:24.125
God, you want an actual pitch?

17:25.333 --> 17:26.625
Used to hear a lot of pitches.

17:26.708 --> 17:28.958
Right, 'cause you were
all Shark Tank for a second there.

17:29.041 --> 17:31.500
Yeah, Shark Tank meets Silicon Valley.

17:32.083 --> 17:33.583
Just call me Mr. Wonderful.

17:34.708 --> 17:35.875
Now, sharks.

17:35.958 --> 17:37.416
[chuckles] Mmm.

17:37.500 --> 17:40.583
Have you ever woken up
and went to AA on the mainland,

17:40.666 --> 17:42.708
and thought,
"There's got to be a better way."

17:42.791 --> 17:43.708
I'm listenin'.

17:43.791 --> 17:47.000
So our patented Erin Routine starts
with 40 minutes of morning sickness.

17:47.083 --> 17:48.166
Huh, go on.

17:48.250 --> 17:51.833
Then, a classroom full of teenagers,
all of whom think you're an idiot,

17:51.916 --> 17:55.250
but half of whom smell like fishing boats
that they spent their mornings working.

17:55.333 --> 17:56.375
Nice.

17:56.458 --> 17:58.958
Then city council,
where you will be kind of,

17:59.041 --> 18:02.083
-but not really, slut-shamed by Bev Keane.
-Ah.

18:02.166 --> 18:04.166
She really misses
your awful mother, by the way.

18:04.250 --> 18:07.291
And that is followed by an hour
of evening morning sickness.

18:07.375 --> 18:10.500
Is evening morning sickness
worse than morning morning sickness?

18:10.583 --> 18:12.208
Oh, substantially.

18:12.291 --> 18:14.166
See, for those reasons, I am out.

18:14.250 --> 18:15.333
That's a bummer.

18:20.250 --> 18:22.791
I should get going.
I don't wanna keep my parents waiting.

18:24.666 --> 18:26.250
Some things never change.

18:29.833 --> 18:34.000
I remember a 15-year-old Riley
sneaking out of my bedroom window,

18:34.750 --> 18:35.958
trying to make curfew.

18:39.833 --> 18:41.458
Don't want to upset the parents.

18:42.833 --> 18:43.791
Have a good night, Erin.

18:46.458 --> 18:47.333

[indistinct chatter]

22:31.125 --> 22:34.250
There they are. Dolly, Wade.

22:35.166 --> 22:36.750
Little more crowded today.

22:36.833 --> 22:38.375
[Bev] Mmm. Just wait till Easter.

22:38.958 --> 22:42.416
If it weren't for that and Christmas,
some people would never come at all.

22:42.500 --> 22:43.750
Not like us though.

22:43.833 --> 22:46.583
[Father Paul] It's great to see
so many of you here today.

22:47.916 --> 22:50.750
But I do have to ask,
why not every Sunday?

22:51.791 --> 22:53.958
Christmas, Easter, I get that.

22:54.041 --> 22:59.541
But there's also always an uptick
around the start of Lent.

23:00.583 --> 23:03.166
Why is that?
What's so special about today?

23:04.291 --> 23:08.583
Ash Wednesday, beginning of Lent.
It's hardly a crowd-pleaser.

23:08.666 --> 23:12.375
The beginning of repentance,
making amends for our sins.

23:13.416 --> 23:14.625
Sin.

23:15.250 --> 23:19.666
This darkness,
this blackness that spilled into us.

23:20.625 --> 23:24.875
That darkness,
we wear it on our forehead today.

23:24.958 --> 23:26.750
Just a smudge of it. Uh…

23:26.833 --> 23:33.375
A smudge of death,
of ash, of sin for repentance.

23:34.250 --> 23:38.500
Because of where this
is all actually heading, which is Easter.

23:39.125 --> 23:43.875
Rebirth, resurrection, eternal life.
Life that rises again.

23:45.958 --> 23:49.791
Even out of blackness, love rises again.

23:49.875 --> 23:53.041
Even out of sin.
And this island, it will rise again.

23:53.125 --> 23:57.708
Even out of disaster,
rebirth, restoration, eternal life.

23:57.791 --> 23:59.041
Jesus sees you.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.958
Sees you, best of all,
and he sees you true.

24:03.041 --> 24:05.083
Because, don't forget,
who did he seek out?

24:05.166 --> 24:08.750
Who did he turn to, to build his church?

24:08.833 --> 24:10.166
His apostles.

24:10.833 --> 24:14.166
Jesus' first disciples,
they were fishermen.

24:14.250 --> 24:16.750
One of his first miracles, right?

24:16.833 --> 24:19.041
The nets are empty, fishermen desperate.

24:19.125 --> 24:23.708
Jesus says, "Put out into deep water
and let down your nets for a catch,"

24:23.791 --> 24:28.208
and when they pulled up those nets,
a bounty of fish.

24:28.291 --> 24:31.291
He sees you. Oh, yes,
he sees you, brothers and sisters,

24:31.375 --> 24:36.041
and he will resurrect this island,
and he will again fill your nets.

24:36.125 --> 24:39.000
It's great you're here today,
but please keep coming back.

24:39.083 --> 24:42.916
Those doors, they're always open,
as the gates are always open.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.458
You just bring yourself.
God will do the rest.

24:45.541 --> 24:47.666
As Psalm 60 tells us,

24:47.750 --> 24:51.708
"God, You have rejected us,
You have broken us down,

24:51.791 --> 24:54.958
You have been angry. Restore us again."

24:55.041 --> 24:58.041
Do you know what psalms are?
They're songs.

24:58.125 --> 25:01.250
The word psalm from the Greek psalmoi.
It means "music."

25:01.333 --> 25:03.833
Songs of prayer. Songs of praise.

25:03.916 --> 25:06.583
That's who we are. That's who we must be.

25:06.666 --> 25:09.000
That's what it means to have faith,

25:09.083 --> 25:12.208
that in the darkness, in the worst of it,

25:12.291 --> 25:16.416
in the absence of light and hope, we sing.

25:17.500 --> 25:22.666
"Restore us," we sing to the sky.
And He will, my friends. He will.

25:22.750 --> 25:26.166
That same hand
that dealt you your hardship,

25:26.250 --> 25:29.375
that same hand will make you whole.

25:36.333 --> 25:38.541
Remember you are dust
and to dust you shall return.

25:38.625 --> 25:39.625
Remember you are dust…

25:39.708 --> 25:40.708
Lorraine, remember you are dust.

25:40.791 --> 25:43.125
To dust you shall return.
To dust you shall return.

25:43.208 --> 25:46.541
Ben, remember you are dust
and to dust you shall return.

25:46.625 --> 25:49.708
Fiona, remember you are dust
and to dust you shall return.

25:50.416 --> 25:53.916
Erin, remember you are dust
and to dust you shall return.

25:56.666 --> 25:59.875
Tom, remember you are dust and to dust…

25:59.958 --> 26:01.958
Riley, come.

26:02.041 --> 26:03.791
No, Mom, it's okay. Just go ahead.

26:04.375 --> 26:06.125
No, honey. It's not a sacrament.

26:06.208 --> 26:08.375
It's a blessing. Please.

26:08.458 --> 26:12.583
Edward, remember you are dust
and to dust you shall return.

26:16.750 --> 26:19.500
Riley, remember you are dust…

26:23.583 --> 26:25.416
and to dust you shall return.

26:28.208 --> 26:29.250
Bless you, son.

26:31.375 --> 26:32.375
Amen.

26:37.166 --> 26:41.333

and to dust you shall return.

You'd have nothing to compare it to,
your first one and all, but…

27:41.791 --> 27:44.708
Well, it used to just be
a spring festival,

27:44.791 --> 27:46.541
but then St. Patrick's came in

27:46.625 --> 27:50.250
and we coined the phrase,
you know, "Crock Pot Luck."

28:04.958 --> 28:06.583
Oh, yeah. My kinda second date.

28:06.666 --> 28:08.208
[Sarah chuckles]

28:08.291 --> 28:10.041
Now, I've been curious about this place

28:10.125 --> 28:13.291
ever since I saw it on the news,
after that tanker crashed.

28:14.041 --> 28:18.500
It is, though, everything you said.
You've gotta get outta here.

28:19.166 --> 28:21.958
Well, I don't know how
to move my mother anywhere else.

28:22.041 --> 28:23.541
I think that time has passed.

28:24.166 --> 28:28.250
And this is where she wants to be.
It's the only place she ever knew.

28:29.041 --> 28:31.875
I don't want her dying
anywhere unfamiliar.

28:32.958 --> 28:34.166
But yes.

28:35.083 --> 28:36.916
After that, I gotta get out of here.

28:37.666 --> 28:40.958
Well, don't look now,
but I think we're upsetting your clergy.

28:41.916 --> 28:42.750
[Sarah] Oh.

28:43.416 --> 28:44.791
He's not mine.

28:44.875 --> 28:48.041
He's new. But I guess
they all kind of have that same…

28:49.666 --> 28:53.208
They have had the same old monsignor here
since before I was born.

28:53.875 --> 28:57.500
And he would stare at me just like that.

28:57.583 --> 29:00.000
All the time. Even back when I was a kid.

29:00.583 --> 29:02.625
I remember it freaking me out, thinking--

29:02.708 --> 29:05.375
-He knows.
-Oh, yeah. Exactly, he knew! [chuckles]

29:06.083 --> 29:07.083
[singing continues]

29:14.666 --> 29:15.750
[sighs]

29:19.208 --> 29:20.750
This is nice, isn't it?

29:20.833 --> 29:23.333
Uh, yeah.
Everybody seems to be havin' fun.

29:24.083 --> 29:28.458
[Father Paul] Easter Festival
on Crockett Island. It's a special thing.

29:28.541 --> 29:31.958
I've always preferred Easter,
even to Christmas, if I'm honest.

29:32.833 --> 29:36.666
This is my favorite time of year.
Renewal, resurrection.

29:37.375 --> 29:39.125
How's Monsignor Pruitt doin'?

29:39.791 --> 29:41.500
Is he comin' back anytime soon?

29:41.583 --> 29:44.541
This was one of his favorites too,
the Crock Pot Luck.

29:44.625 --> 29:46.250
I think he coined that.

29:46.333 --> 29:48.375
Yeah, he's doin' well. He's better.

29:49.375 --> 29:50.208
Not great.

29:50.291 --> 29:53.958
He speaks fondly of you, though,
by the way. Remembers you well.

29:55.791 --> 29:58.750
Is he, uh, up and about at all?

29:58.833 --> 29:59.833
Why do you ask?

30:01.375 --> 30:02.750
Nothing, just…

30:04.833 --> 30:07.458
The other night
when it was really blowing, I…

30:08.833 --> 30:12.666
I swear I saw him down on the beach.
Just walking in the rain.

30:12.750 --> 30:14.916
Uh-huh. Seems unlikely.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.791
Yeah, I suppose it could
have been someone else, but…

30:18.750 --> 30:21.166
The hat, the coat. It…

30:22.416 --> 30:26.458
It's nuts, I know.
If he's off-island, that is.

30:27.041 --> 30:31.041
Uh, I spoke to him
that night on the phone.

30:31.125 --> 30:35.333
This was before the storm,
to bring him up to speed on my first day.

30:35.416 --> 30:38.500
It was after the afternoon ferry.

30:39.083 --> 30:44.625
It was a landline in his room,
so, I mean, unless he swam here.

30:45.875 --> 30:48.916
Between you and I, Riley,
and I am sorry to say this to you,

30:49.000 --> 30:51.583
that man isn't going anywhere.
Not anytime soon.

30:53.500 --> 30:54.666
I'm sorry to hear that.

30:56.583 --> 30:57.500
Yeah.

30:58.250 --> 30:59.791
Everything has its season.

31:01.000 --> 31:04.541
Well, I appreciate your time, Father,

31:04.625 --> 31:07.833
but I bet there's a lot of people here
who'd like your company too.

31:07.916 --> 31:11.083
I don't wanna hold you up
with the town pariah.

31:12.125 --> 31:15.541
Pariah. Well, no… Okay, you smoked me out.

31:15.625 --> 31:18.416
I actually have an agenda.
Your mother mentioned to me

31:18.500 --> 31:22.791
that you have to travel to the mainland
for your AA meetings.

31:22.875 --> 31:26.291
Get that stamp for the parole board. Yes?

31:26.375 --> 31:27.291
Thanks, Mom.

31:27.375 --> 31:30.833
Well, it got me thinking
that I can start a chapter here, anytime.

31:30.916 --> 31:32.833
I could save you
that trip to the mainland.

31:32.916 --> 31:36.041
Spare you having to burn through
a whole day waiting on the Belle.

31:36.625 --> 31:38.458
We could meet at the rec center.

31:38.541 --> 31:42.833
I… I understand why Crockett
doesn't have a chapter already.

31:42.916 --> 31:44.791
I can't imagine
that there's much of a demand.

31:44.875 --> 31:47.416
But that doesn't mean
that there isn't a need.

31:48.166 --> 31:51.083
Plenty of problem drinkers,
especially these days.

31:51.166 --> 31:52.875
One full-blown alcoholic already,

31:52.958 --> 31:55.916
who's responsible for
the drunken hunting accident

31:56.000 --> 31:59.041
that paralyzed little Leeza, I'm told.

31:59.541 --> 32:02.291
[Riley] Yeah, I don't know
that I'd call it a "hunting accident."

32:03.250 --> 32:08.875
There's not much big game around here.
I think Joe was just shootin' to shoot.

32:09.833 --> 32:11.833
[Father Paul] Yeah, and he still won't
put down the bottle.

32:11.916 --> 32:14.958
But someone like you, Riley,
someone who already has,

32:15.041 --> 32:17.083
could set quite the example.

32:17.166 --> 32:19.083
Can you imagine that?
The good you could do?

32:19.166 --> 32:21.375
Just by skipping a trip to the mainland?

32:22.166 --> 32:23.875
Sorry, do you mind if I interrupt?

32:24.708 --> 32:26.250
Not at all, Miss Greene.

32:26.333 --> 32:28.250
Really enjoyed your homily today, Father.

32:28.333 --> 32:31.583
-Oh, thank you. Beautiful day, isn't it?
-[Erin] Mmm-hmm.

32:32.416 --> 32:34.875
Think about what I said.
No hard feelings either way.

-Yeah.

33:00.583 --> 33:03.875
I used to think, "One day I'll be older,
and I'll get drink tickets

33:03.958 --> 33:06.166
and I will exchange them
for a glass of wine."

33:06.250 --> 33:08.208
"And that's when I'll feel like an adult."

33:09.375 --> 33:10.875
And now here we are.

33:10.958 --> 33:15.375
Two adults with drink tickets
that neither of us can use.

33:17.791 --> 33:21.166
My mom used to go around and ask everybody
if they were gonna use theirs,

33:21.250 --> 33:24.666
and at the end of the day she would have
a handful of these blue tickets

33:24.750 --> 33:26.333
that she would dutifully spend.

33:28.166 --> 33:30.958
Night after the potluck
was not great at my house.

33:31.041 --> 33:32.250
I'm sorry.

33:32.916 --> 33:35.416
It's okay. She's just everywhere here.

33:35.500 --> 33:38.375
Her memory. I work in the same job.

33:38.458 --> 33:40.875
I live in the same house,
sleep in the same bed.

33:40.958 --> 33:42.208
And I'm alone just like her.

33:42.291 --> 33:45.625

it's only temporary, but I--

33:45.708 --> 33:46.916
You're nothin' like her.

33:48.791 --> 33:51.416
I remember that much. And you're gonna be…

33:53.208 --> 33:54.916
-Fine.
-Great.

33:56.375 --> 33:59.708

34:54.708 --> 34:59.250
Who did this to a helpless little dog?

34:59.333 --> 35:02.291
Oh, my God. Pike.

35:03.833 --> 35:06.333
Hey. Easy now, Joe.

35:07.791 --> 35:10.750
-Any idea what happened?
-Yes. He was poisoned!

35:11.541 --> 35:13.000
That's what happened.

You don't like me? That's fine!

about me so much either.

35:29.583 --> 35:30.833
Can you help?

35:33.708 --> 35:35.500
Did anybody see him eat anything?

35:36.583 --> 35:38.791
Maybe he got into something
that he shouldn't have.

35:39.583 --> 35:42.375
Or maybe it was a horrible accident.

No, no, it's nothing like that.

38:48.958 --> 38:52.000
I'm just following up
on our little island mystery.

38:52.750 --> 38:53.875
The cats.

38:54.791 --> 38:55.916
The dog.

38:57.375 --> 38:58.791
We confirmed that it was poison.

38:58.875 --> 39:00.750
Oh. That's tragic.

39:00.833 --> 39:01.708
[Hassan] I was wondering,

39:02.583 --> 39:08.166
you were talkin' a while back about
that rat stuff, compound, what was it--

39:08.250 --> 39:09.166
Ten-eighty.

39:09.250 --> 39:11.916
Ten-eighty.
That's it behind you, isn't it?

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
It is.

39:14.166 --> 39:15.541
And yes, you're correct.

39:15.625 --> 39:17.291
After those cats,

39:17.375 --> 39:19.791
not knowing what on earth
could have done it,

39:19.875 --> 39:23.041
I put some out, strategically,
carefully, around my property.

39:23.125 --> 39:25.458
A few others requested
I do the same for them.

39:25.541 --> 39:29.458
And if that poor dog,
if it ingested some, accidentally,

39:30.458 --> 39:31.916
well, I'll just be a wreck.

39:32.708 --> 39:33.875
Is that what you're telling me?

39:34.958 --> 39:37.583
Please, if that's what occurred,
if you're certain…

39:38.125 --> 39:40.458
Well, I don't know
if I'll ever forgive myself.

39:41.625 --> 39:42.833
So is it?

39:43.958 --> 39:45.125
And are you?

39:46.333 --> 39:48.333
Certain, I mean.

39:49.791 --> 39:51.166
I'm not telling you that.

39:51.916 --> 39:54.041
Can't say just about anything for certain.

39:55.625 --> 39:59.041
Anyone else tend to have access
to those chemicals?

39:59.125 --> 40:00.666
Well, I should hope so.

40:00.750 --> 40:03.583
They're for the whole island, after all.
We just store them here.

40:04.583 --> 40:07.708
Heck, you walked right on in here,
didn't you?

40:08.208 --> 40:12.333
If you had wanted to grab a gallon,
who would have known it?

40:14.708 --> 40:16.166
You are right, Sheriff.

40:17.375 --> 40:19.583
I see what you're getting at
and you are right.

40:21.416 --> 40:23.541
I should really lock these up.

40:30.541 --> 40:31.958
You have a good day, Bev.

40:32.041 --> 40:34.041
You do the same, Sheriff.

40:47.583 --> 40:50.500
I'll come by the next couple weeks,
change the oil and air filter for you.

40:50.583 --> 40:51.833
Should be good for a while though.

40:51.916 --> 40:55.291
Why are you doin' this to me, man?
I'm trying to quit dark sodas.

40:55.375 --> 40:56.291
[Joe chuckles]

40:56.375 --> 40:59.458
I don't know if I have enough on me.
I can write ya a check.

41:00.541 --> 41:01.625
You're good.

41:02.416 --> 41:03.458
[Joe] Next time.

41:04.250 --> 41:06.541
Yeah, that'll work.
Just try not to run it for long.

41:07.041 --> 41:09.500
-Only for, like, legit emergencies.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:09.583 --> 41:10.708
[Hassan] Joe.

41:13.125 --> 41:14.083
[Joe] Sharif.

41:15.166 --> 41:16.500
What are you doing here, Bowl?

41:17.250 --> 41:19.958
Helping my man, Joe. Same as every month.

41:20.041 --> 41:23.541
He keeps my genny going.
Changes the filters once in a while.

41:23.625 --> 41:27.541
And if I search your pockets,
that's what I'll find? Air filters?

41:28.500 --> 41:31.583
If you try to search my pockets,
you'll just find a fist up your ass.

41:31.666 --> 41:34.750
[Joe chuckles] Okay. Stop kiddin',
you crazy little fuck. That's…

41:34.833 --> 41:39.166
Sheriff, you search whatever you want
on my property. You knock yourself out.

41:39.875 --> 41:43.583
My friend here is just leaving,
and he means no harm.

41:43.666 --> 41:47.708
Not his fault
he was born woefully fuckin' unfunny.

42:00.208 --> 42:01.833
Kid's just helping me out.

42:01.916 --> 42:03.250
Kid's a drug dealer.

42:03.333 --> 42:04.958
Not when he's here, he's not.

42:05.750 --> 42:09.333
And he's about the only person on
this island treats me like a human being.

42:09.416 --> 42:11.541
So if that's the reason,

42:11.625 --> 42:14.333
well, I kind of wish
all you assholes was drug dealers.

42:14.916 --> 42:16.083
Did you charge her yet?

42:16.166 --> 42:18.833
Miss Keane insists
she has no idea what happened.

42:18.916 --> 42:23.458
Oh, she insists? Why didn't you just
fuckin' say so. That changes everything.

42:23.541 --> 42:26.041
Now, there was some chemicals nearby
for rats and such.

42:26.125 --> 42:26.958
[Joe] Rats.

42:27.041 --> 42:29.291
-If the dog got into something by--
-Pike.

42:30.500 --> 42:31.583
His name was Pike.

42:32.416 --> 42:34.666
If Pike got into something by accident--

42:34.750 --> 42:37.166
There weren't no accident, okay?

42:37.791 --> 42:39.500
But you know what, Sheriff?

42:39.583 --> 42:41.958
I didn't expect
this would go any different.

42:42.541 --> 42:45.791
Not with me, not here, not with her.

42:45.875 --> 42:49.041
She killed half the island
with that fucking settlement.

42:49.125 --> 42:51.916
-What's one more dog on the pile?
-Look, I hear you, Joe.

42:52.000 --> 42:55.458
Yeah, I've known that woman
since grade school.

42:55.541 --> 42:58.250
And nothing she's ever done or does is by…

42:58.958 --> 43:00.750
You know what? Forget it.

43:01.375 --> 43:03.500
You're a smart man, Sharif,

43:03.583 --> 43:07.333
but in this case, you don't know
what the fuck you're talking about.

43:07.416 --> 43:09.541
So let's just leave it there.

43:09.625 --> 43:12.250
I know Bev Keane too, all right?
Not as well as you,

43:12.916 --> 43:14.958
but enough to know
you're not wrong about her.

43:16.458 --> 43:17.708
You're not wrong, Joe.

43:20.333 --> 43:21.500
Thank you.

43:36.166 --> 43:39.083
I gotta say, to be honest,
I hadn't really considered

43:39.166 --> 43:41.083
how awkward this would be
with just two people.

43:41.166 --> 43:43.625
I really don't know
how to start. [chuckles]

43:44.250 --> 43:46.958
-Riley. Alcoholic.
-Hi, Riley.

43:48.291 --> 43:51.625
All right, would you object
if I began with Serenity?

43:51.708 --> 43:54.000
Uh, be my guest.

43:54.083 --> 43:55.166
[Father Paul] All right.

43:56.833 --> 44:00.000
God grant me the serenity
to accept the things that I can…

44:01.916 --> 44:03.666
-Maybe we should do it together.
-Mmm.

44:04.291 --> 44:06.333
[both] To accept the things
I cannot change,

44:06.416 --> 44:11.583
the courage to change the things I can,
and the wisdom to know the difference.

44:12.333 --> 44:13.291
Amen.

44:13.958 --> 44:18.416
[clicks tongue] And we're off.
So how do you wanna do this?

44:19.250 --> 44:20.750
I think we just talk.

44:22.250 --> 44:23.333
Okay.

44:24.000 --> 44:24.916
Um…

44:28.208 --> 44:31.541
-I kinda wanna talk about this place.
-Oh.

44:32.458 --> 44:35.083
Way I hear it, Bev Keane
was encouraging people

44:35.166 --> 44:38.958
to take the settlements from
the oil companies almost from the start.

44:39.041 --> 44:40.666
It seemed like a lot of money, I guess,

44:40.750 --> 44:43.750
until you hold it up against
a couple years of lost wages,

44:43.833 --> 44:46.791
but not a lot of people
really doing that math back then.

44:48.750 --> 44:49.833
And there's Bev Keane saying,

44:49.916 --> 44:52.416
"Go ahead, take the cash.
It's a gift from God."

44:52.500 --> 44:55.333
"And maybe give a little
back to God while you're at it."

44:55.916 --> 44:56.833
And they do.

44:56.916 --> 45:00.166
Take the money, they turn around
and hand some of it right to the church,

45:00.250 --> 45:06.916
which, with Pruitt being sick as he was,
means they really were giving it to her.

45:07.500 --> 45:09.333
And that won't look right, I guess.

45:09.416 --> 45:13.083
So, lo and behold,
she builds this rec center. [scoffs]

45:14.208 --> 45:16.666
Who knows if it actually cost
as much as people gave her.

45:17.416 --> 45:20.625
With so many of them gone now,
there's really no way to know for sure.

45:21.500 --> 45:23.125
Catholic Church in a nutshell.

45:23.750 --> 45:24.833
All over the world,

45:25.416 --> 45:30.791
these small, starving villages
with big, fancy churches.

45:31.583 --> 45:34.375
Gettin' bigger and fancier,
while the towns dry up.

45:34.458 --> 45:40.041
Churches just poppin' up like fat,
plump little ticks suckin' the town dry.

45:40.916 --> 45:46.041
[hesitates] Okay, so…
We can safely say you're not practicing.

45:46.125 --> 45:47.958
-That's safe.
-Not always the case, though.

45:48.041 --> 45:49.500
You were an altar boy.

45:50.250 --> 45:51.750
Does that surprise you?

45:51.833 --> 45:55.083
Monsignor Pruitt said that,
uh, back in the day,

45:55.166 --> 45:57.541
he didn't think
you lacked for belief or faith.

45:57.625 --> 46:02.000
Yeah, I'd rather not go
too far down that road tonight.

46:02.083 --> 46:03.708
I mean, you seem like a nice guy.

46:03.791 --> 46:07.166
You're doin' me a favor.
I just would not want to offend you.

46:07.250 --> 46:08.416
That's tough to do.

46:09.000 --> 46:13.166
And AA, it's not about
protecting people's feelings, is it?

46:13.250 --> 46:16.000
It's about recovery,
responsibility, honesty,

46:16.083 --> 46:18.125
support, more than anything else.

46:18.208 --> 46:22.458
-And of course, the higher power.
-Yeah, that part.

46:22.541 --> 46:24.208
-Mmm-hmm.
-See, it's…

46:25.375 --> 46:28.750
It's not the only game in town
as far as recovery, you know?

46:28.833 --> 46:30.291
You ever heard of RR?

46:31.000 --> 46:33.541
-RR?
-AA for pirates?

46:33.625 --> 46:35.416
Oh. [chuckles]

46:35.500 --> 46:40.083
"Rational Recovery."
It's based more on reason and psychology.

46:40.166 --> 46:42.625
It's about empowering people
instead of saying they're powerless.

46:42.708 --> 46:45.250
So you're the higher power,
is that how it works?

46:45.333 --> 46:49.000
Addictive Voice Recognition Technique,
that's how it works. AVRT.

46:49.083 --> 46:52.166
-Oh.
-Recognizing the addictive voice inside.

46:52.250 --> 46:56.000
It's not that I want to drink, it's that
the addictive voice wants to, the AV.

46:56.083 --> 47:00.625
So you learn to identify it,
separate it and control it.

47:00.708 --> 47:03.750
Being your own higher power,
how is that working out for you?

47:03.833 --> 47:05.750
I haven't had a drop in four years.

47:05.833 --> 47:08.541
Not much of a selection
in prison though, is there?

47:08.625 --> 47:09.958
[chuckles] No.

47:10.041 --> 47:13.583
Look, Jesus' first miracle
was turning water into wine.

47:13.666 --> 47:18.583
Alcohol isn't good or bad.
Not itself. But it's people.

47:19.250 --> 47:20.166
Mmm?

47:21.000 --> 47:22.458
Do you know
how many of us have this problem?

47:22.541 --> 47:24.416
It's a lot actually, 1 in 12 of us.

47:25.708 --> 47:27.500
-I haven't counted.
-Yeah, 12.

47:27.583 --> 47:30.833
That's a funny coincidence,
that number pops up a lot in the Bible,

47:30.916 --> 47:33.875
but there's 1 in 12 of us
for whom alcohol,

47:33.958 --> 47:36.958
this thing which isn't good or bad,
causes great suffering.

47:37.041 --> 47:38.291
Caused you suffering.

47:39.250 --> 47:40.625
I know it did that.

47:40.708 --> 47:45.500
God can take that pain
and turn it into something good.

47:45.583 --> 47:47.291
Something with purpose.

47:48.333 --> 47:50.125
Suffering can be a gift.

47:50.208 --> 47:51.708
It all just depends on us.

47:52.500 --> 47:54.541
What we do with it, how we react to it.

47:54.625 --> 47:58.041
So, alcohol, that isn't good or bad.

47:58.833 --> 48:02.708
The same with guilt, grief, suffering.

48:02.791 --> 48:05.208
It just depends on what we do with it.

48:06.208 --> 48:08.083
What's more empowering than that?

48:08.166 --> 48:09.125
No.

48:10.416 --> 48:13.083
Alcohol isn't good or bad.

48:14.250 --> 48:18.000
But the version of me that would come out
when I had enough to drink,

48:19.500 --> 48:20.458
he was bad.

48:21.750 --> 48:24.583
He was selfish and careless,
and he ruined my life.

48:25.666 --> 48:29.458
There is a saboteur inside of me,

48:29.541 --> 48:32.041
and I always thought,
you know, we'd work it out.

48:32.125 --> 48:36.041
We'd learn to live with each other,
because he wouldn't really hurt me.

48:36.708 --> 48:39.375
Not me. I fed him, so he wouldn't hurt me.

48:40.916 --> 48:43.666
And then one morning I woke up
and found out he killed someone.

48:52.583 --> 48:54.875
I had killed someone.

48:55.958 --> 48:59.791
So who's to blame there?
I am to blame there.

49:01.875 --> 49:03.125
And God?

49:03.833 --> 49:04.708
[scoffs]

49:05.333 --> 49:07.041
He just kinda let it happen, didn't he?

49:08.291 --> 49:11.833
See that? That's the part I cannot square.

49:11.916 --> 49:15.291
Because you're right,
there is so much suffering in the world.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.083
So much.
And then there's this higher power.

49:18.166 --> 49:22.000
This higher power
who could erase all that pain,

49:22.083 --> 49:25.541
just wave his hand
and make it all go away, but doesn't?

49:27.208 --> 49:28.250
No.

49:29.541 --> 49:30.791
No, thank you.

49:30.875 --> 49:34.083
The worst part is that it lets
all the rest of us off the hook.

49:34.166 --> 49:36.166
We can all just stand by

49:36.250 --> 49:39.208
and watch Leeza Scarborough
wheel herself around town.

49:39.291 --> 49:41.750
We can watch Joe Collie
slowly drink himself to death.

49:41.833 --> 49:45.708
We can watch so many people
just slip into these bottomless pits of…

49:46.291 --> 49:48.500
of awful and we can stand it.

49:49.291 --> 49:51.500
We can tolerate it

49:51.583 --> 49:54.666
because we can say things like,
"God works in mysterious ways."

49:54.750 --> 49:58.708
Like there's a plan? Like something good's
gonna come out of it?

49:58.791 --> 50:01.083
Nothing good came out of my drinking.

50:01.666 --> 50:04.333
Nothing good came out
of me killing that poor girl.

50:04.416 --> 50:06.541
Nothing good came out
of Joe Collie's drinking.

50:06.625 --> 50:09.416
Not a single good thing comes out
of Leeza never being able to walk again.

50:10.083 --> 50:14.041
Nothing good came out of a metric ton
of crude oil filling up the bay.

50:14.125 --> 50:18.000
And the only thing, the only fucking thing
that lets people stand by,

50:18.083 --> 50:21.833
watching all this suffering,
doing nothing, doing fucking nothing,

50:23.000 --> 50:25.708
is the idea
that suffering can be a gift from God.

50:28.791 --> 50:30.750
What a monstrous idea, Father.

50:30.833 --> 50:31.750
Yeah.

50:34.458 --> 50:35.291
Yeah.

50:37.416 --> 50:38.291
[inhales]

50:39.041 --> 50:43.000
Look, there's nothing in the scripture,
or in the world for that matter,

50:43.083 --> 50:45.208
that suggests

50:46.666 --> 50:50.583
God negates personal accountability.

50:51.416 --> 50:55.166
There's certainly nothing
in the program to suggest that.

50:55.250 --> 50:56.833
Not at all, in fact.

50:57.666 --> 51:01.333
I believe God can take our work,

51:01.416 --> 51:08.000
even our awful works,
and turn them into something else.

51:08.750 --> 51:10.708
I know He can find the good in them,

51:10.791 --> 51:13.958
and find the love in them,
whether we see it or not.

51:14.958 --> 51:18.416
That I know… Riley Flynn.

51:20.166 --> 51:21.291
That I know.

51:36.666 --> 51:37.541
[thudding]

51:53.833 --> 51:54.916
[thudding continues]

51:55.583 --> 51:57.375
[floorboard creaking]

52:09.125 --> 52:10.041
[thudding]

52:52.083 --> 52:53.083
[urinating]

53:18.375 --> 53:19.333
[inhales sharply]

53:22.541 --> 53:23.750
I'm so sorry.

53:24.541 --> 53:25.791
You did the right thing.

53:25.875 --> 53:27.500
It's better to be safe, you know?

53:28.750 --> 53:29.958
Everything's just fine.

53:30.041 --> 53:31.375
Oh, thank you, God.

53:33.208 --> 53:34.541
Yeah, everything's fine.

53:35.291 --> 53:37.041
-Just a little spotting.
-[Erin sighs]

53:38.833 --> 53:40.375
I'm sorry I woke you up.

53:42.208 --> 53:46.000
If you hadn't, if you'd waited until
tomorrow and something really was wrong?

53:46.083 --> 53:50.833
No, honey. That's why I'm here.
You did the right thing. Here, listen.

53:51.708 --> 53:52.791
[heart beating]

53:55.875 --> 53:57.583
Hi, baby.

53:57.666 --> 53:59.458
See? Baby's just fine.

54:00.708 --> 54:02.875
Mom's a little
worked up though, Littlefoot.

54:02.958 --> 54:04.791
It's just 'cause she loves you, though.

54:05.500 --> 54:07.333
-Thank you again.
-Of course.

54:25.125 --> 54:27.291
-Sarah! Sarah!
-[Sarah gasps]

54:27.375 --> 54:28.375
Jesus, Mom!

54:28.875 --> 54:30.500
-Come quick! Come!
-[Sarah] Jesus.

54:30.583 --> 54:32.958
[Mildred] I thought I saw your father.

54:33.041 --> 54:35.791
His clothes. I thought it was your dad.

54:36.458 --> 54:38.166
Dad's been dead for 15 years.

54:39.291 --> 54:40.916
It's not getting any easier
to tell you that.

54:41.000 --> 54:45.125
No, it was something else.
It came right up to the window.

54:45.208 --> 54:47.375
Oh, Sarah. That face.

54:49.291 --> 54:53.166
[breathing heavily] That face.
Oh. That face.

55:10.291 --> 55:11.375
[creaking]

55:37.625 --> 55:38.458
Hello?

55:39.333 --> 55:40.333
Somebody there?

55:48.125 --> 55:49.000
[echoing] Hello?

55:50.916 --> 55:51.750
Somebody there?

56:09.708 --> 56:10.625
Who's that?

56:14.125 --> 56:15.208
[echoing] Who's that?

56:30.416 --> 56:32.166
That you, Ooker?

56:43.500 --> 56:44.375
[thudding]

56:54.750 --> 56:55.666
[door shuts]

57:03.666 --> 57:05.541
-Good morning, Father.
-[Father Paul] Leeza.

57:16.125 --> 57:19.291
[Bev] Our responsorial psalm today
is Psalm 27.

57:20.083 --> 57:24.625
"The Lord is my light and my salvation,
whom then shall I fear?"

57:25.375 --> 57:31.041
"The Lord is the strength of my life,
of whom then shall I be afraid?"

57:31.125 --> 57:34.041
"When evildoers came upon me
to eat up my flesh,

57:34.125 --> 57:38.083
it was they, my foes and adversaries,
who stumbled and fell."

57:38.166 --> 57:43.375
"Though an army should encamp against me,
yet my heart shall not be afraid."

57:43.458 --> 57:46.291
"And though war should rise up against me,

57:46.375 --> 57:48.208
I will put my trust in Him."

57:48.791 --> 57:52.625
"One thing I have asked of the Lord,
one thing I seek,

57:52.708 --> 57:57.291
that I may dwell in the house of the Lord,
all the days of my life."

57:58.750 --> 57:59.958
[organ playing softly]

58:11.708 --> 58:13.000
Body of Christ, Leeza.

58:13.833 --> 58:14.958
Amen.

58:22.916 --> 58:24.458
Come on. Body of Christ.

58:25.250 --> 58:27.250
Father, what are you doing?
[chuckles nervously]

58:31.166 --> 58:32.833
-Body of Christ.
-What are you doing?

58:38.291 --> 58:39.625
No. No.

58:39.708 --> 58:41.458
[crowd murmuring]
