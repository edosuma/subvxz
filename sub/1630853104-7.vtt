WEBVTT

00:01.088 --> 00:02.785
Previously onHalo.

00:02.828 --> 00:04.526
But war need not be the answer.

00:04.569 --> 00:05.788
Vinsher'’s a fool.

00:05.831 --> 00:07.920
Jin Ha, tell our young one here,

00:07.964 --> 00:10.227
either Madrigal is free,
or it'’s not.

00:12.055 --> 00:15.058
Papa! No!

00:15.102 --> 00:17.930
Covenant forces
on planet Madrigal neutralized.

00:17.974 --> 00:19.454
One survivor.

00:19.497 --> 00:21.325
Keep her safe. Promise me.

00:21.369 --> 00:22.805
I give you my word.

00:22.848 --> 00:25.112
You should not have returned.

00:25.155 --> 00:26.591
Vinsher allowed us

00:26.635 --> 00:28.071
to collect our dead,

00:28.115 --> 00:29.768
but the revolution is over.

00:29.812 --> 00:33.685
Kwan Ha, an instigator.
I need her removed.

00:33.729 --> 00:35.644
Your father visited
a group in the desert.

00:35.687 --> 00:38.125
-Mystics.
-What did they tell him?

00:38.168 --> 00:40.518
Our real reason
for being on Madrigal.

00:40.562 --> 00:42.825
Where can I find these Mystics?

00:42.868 --> 00:44.174
We'’re about to have
Vinsher'’s

00:44.218 --> 00:45.654
entire army on our ass.

00:45.697 --> 00:47.743
Let'’s go.

00:47.786 --> 00:49.527
You owe me one ship

00:49.571 --> 00:51.616
and a shitload
of deuterium money.

00:51.660 --> 00:53.923
-You need to face reality.

00:53.966 --> 00:55.838
Your freedom fighter days
are over.

00:55.881 --> 00:57.187
No one'’s going to step up.

01:00.625 --> 01:02.062
There ain'’t no more heroes.

01:21.255 --> 01:23.257
Wow, Kwan,
how did you do that?

01:23.300 --> 01:25.650
I'’ll never tell.

01:25.694 --> 01:27.174
...20 feet into the well
before he remembered

01:27.217 --> 01:29.219
he was holding
a flaming torch.

01:29.263 --> 01:31.047
Oh, no!

01:31.091 --> 01:33.354
Nearly blew himself
to pieces, the dumb bastard.

01:33.397 --> 01:35.269
-Pass my bowl.
-So, what did you do?

01:35.312 --> 01:37.706
What did I do? What could I do?
I put him on the day shift.

01:39.055 --> 01:40.622
I don'’t--
I don'’t get it.

01:40.665 --> 01:42.450
You don'’t need a torch
on the day shift.

01:42.493 --> 01:44.321
Oh, Professor,
your dinner'’s getting cold.

01:44.365 --> 01:46.106
My apologies to the chef.

01:46.149 --> 01:48.195
I found this one wandering
around like a lost puppy.

01:48.238 --> 01:50.066
General Ha, I'’m sorry, you're
eating. I didn'’t mean to...

01:50.110 --> 01:51.720
Nonsense. Join us.

01:51.763 --> 01:53.069
You look like
you could use a meal.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.679
That'’s very kind.

01:54.723 --> 01:56.420
You'’ve just
enlisted, is that right?

01:56.464 --> 01:58.292
Yes, ma'’am. My name's Ruben.
I'’m from Castra.

01:58.335 --> 01:59.728
Welcome to the fight,
young man.

01:59.771 --> 02:01.338
Thank you, General Terne.

02:01.382 --> 02:03.035
Take a seat
with the wee ones.

02:03.079 --> 02:06.256
-Let the grownups talk, eh?

02:06.300 --> 02:07.692
Show us the trick again,
Kwan. Again.

02:07.736 --> 02:09.172
Not now. Beat it.

02:09.216 --> 02:10.565
Some news from Madrigal City.

02:10.608 --> 02:12.001
Two divisions of Marines
just pulled out,

02:12.044 --> 02:13.655
and they were in a hurry.

02:13.698 --> 02:15.744
They'’re going to send more.
They always do.

02:15.787 --> 02:18.225
From what I hear, it'’s happening
all across the outer colonies.

02:18.268 --> 02:21.663
The UNSC'’s spread thin.
They'’re on the run.

02:21.706 --> 02:24.013
I'’ll take any retreat
as a chance to move forward.

02:24.056 --> 02:27.190
But Agatha is right.
Take nothing for granted.

02:28.452 --> 02:30.019
Aren'’t you handsome.

02:35.372 --> 02:36.591
Nice to meet you.

02:36.634 --> 02:37.940
I'’m Ruben. I'm--

02:37.983 --> 02:39.289
Ruben from Castra.

02:39.333 --> 02:40.856
I heard.

02:48.342 --> 02:49.473
What?

02:50.953 --> 02:52.346
I'’m sorry.
I don'’t speak your--

02:52.389 --> 02:55.436
So, tell me,
Ruben from Castra,

02:55.479 --> 02:57.525
what will you do
after the war?

02:57.568 --> 02:59.396
-After the war?
-Mm.

02:59.440 --> 03:02.051
Um... I don'’t know.

03:02.094 --> 03:05.533
I'’m guessing you grew up
working the heavy water rigs.

03:05.576 --> 03:07.056
Will you go back to that?

03:07.099 --> 03:08.666
I... I guess.

03:08.710 --> 03:11.016
Then nothing really changes
for you, does it?

03:12.061 --> 03:13.541
What do you mean?

03:13.584 --> 03:18.372
I mean, even if we win the war
against the UNSC

03:18.415 --> 03:20.243
and you don'’t die,
you'’ll still be

03:20.287 --> 03:21.984
out there pumping fuel
like the rest of us.

03:22.027 --> 03:23.812
I'’m fighting
for a free Madrigal.

03:23.855 --> 03:26.031
-So was my mother.
-That'’s enough!

03:31.167 --> 03:32.864
If you'’re going to feed
your soldiers, Father...

03:34.518 --> 03:36.259
at least don'’t feed them lies.

03:39.306 --> 03:41.612
-Anywhere but here.
-Kwan!

05:27.892 --> 05:29.590
Who'’s there?

06:44.316 --> 06:45.579
Birds.

06:45.622 --> 06:47.450
You believe that shit?

06:47.494 --> 06:50.758
Goddamn flock of quad wings
got sucked up my intake valves

06:50.801 --> 06:53.325
about a thousand feet
over the surface of Madrigal.

06:53.369 --> 06:55.589
Oh, no! What did you do?

06:55.632 --> 06:58.461
Well, I did what I always do.
I fell back on my training.

06:58.505 --> 07:00.115
I aimed for a sand dune

07:00.158 --> 07:03.335
and brought it down
in a controlled roll...

07:03.379 --> 07:04.511
for about a mile and a half.

07:06.208 --> 07:09.080
Incredible! What an absolutely
incredible story.

07:09.124 --> 07:10.430
It is, isn'’t it?

07:10.473 --> 07:12.432
-Here'’s to you.
-Yes.

07:13.694 --> 07:15.130
Here'’s to me.

07:19.787 --> 07:21.876
Oh, shit. Let'’s go home.

07:23.225 --> 07:25.183
These aren'’t my people.

07:31.973 --> 07:35.411
Bang, I take out two
UNSC Broadswords with one shot,

07:35.455 --> 07:37.108
the old seven-ten split.

07:37.152 --> 07:38.980
But the squad leader'’s
still on my tail,

07:39.023 --> 07:40.547
so I'’m bobbing and weaving,

07:40.590 --> 07:42.984
when, boom, I hit those
goddamn quad wings.

07:43.027 --> 07:44.507
No!

07:44.551 --> 07:46.335
Whole ship
starts breaking apart.

07:46.378 --> 07:48.337
Next thing I know,
I'’m ass-up, doing five G's.

07:48.380 --> 07:49.643
-No way!
-Then I see it.

07:49.686 --> 07:51.209
-The safe I just stole...
-Come on!

07:51.253 --> 07:52.907
...loaded with cash,
comes flying past me--

07:52.950 --> 07:55.562
right out the front window,
I kid you not.

07:55.605 --> 07:57.868
Good thing is, it took out
the ship behind me.

08:00.741 --> 08:04.353
Now, I'’m about ten seconds
from lights out, huh?

08:04.396 --> 08:05.789
And suddenly...

08:07.399 --> 08:09.227
I had a vision.

08:09.271 --> 08:10.794
I saw the love of my life.

08:10.838 --> 08:13.188
I saw my boy,
my beautiful boy.

08:13.231 --> 08:15.059
Aww!

08:15.103 --> 08:16.844
I saw everything
crystal clear.

08:16.887 --> 08:18.585
It was...

08:20.891 --> 08:22.458
it was beautiful.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.504
So beautiful.

08:24.547 --> 08:25.896
-Aww.
-Cheers.

08:25.940 --> 08:27.507
What happened to the girl?

08:30.248 --> 08:34.514
A rebel girl from Madrigal
with a bounty on her head.

08:36.298 --> 08:38.735
Soren had her
here on the Rubble.

08:38.779 --> 08:41.303
But did he share her
with his partner?

08:41.346 --> 08:43.131
No.

08:43.174 --> 08:47.439
He took off with her to collect
the bounty for himself.

08:47.483 --> 08:50.399
The next thing you know,
he'’s back.

08:50.442 --> 08:53.968
No girl, no bounty, no ship.

08:54.011 --> 08:55.360
So, what happened?

08:55.404 --> 08:56.666
Is there a problem, friend?

08:56.710 --> 09:00.714
We had a plan, Trokan and me.

09:00.757 --> 09:02.454
A big score.

09:02.498 --> 09:04.195
Something in it
for all of us.

09:05.980 --> 09:07.721
You didn'’t want to hear it.

09:07.764 --> 09:10.288
I run my business
the way I see fit.

09:10.332 --> 09:13.030
So we should go hungry.

09:13.074 --> 09:14.945
You appear to be eating
pretty well.

09:21.082 --> 09:22.605
People are talking.

09:22.649 --> 09:24.389
Oh, yeah?

09:26.870 --> 09:28.916
And what are they saying?

09:33.137 --> 09:34.312
Like...

09:36.010 --> 09:38.360
maybe Soren'’s lost a step.

09:38.403 --> 09:39.796
That right?

09:41.668 --> 09:43.670
Soren, darling,
forget about it.

09:43.713 --> 09:44.975
No, no.

09:46.760 --> 09:47.978
I want to hear
what he has to say.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.766
Little Squirrel
finally gathered his nuts.

09:55.464 --> 09:57.118
So...

09:57.161 --> 09:59.076
you tell me.

09:59.120 --> 10:00.687
Have I lost a step?

10:15.397 --> 10:17.486
He'’s had too much
to drink.

10:17.529 --> 10:19.662
Come, sweetheart.

10:19.706 --> 10:20.968
It'’s a party.

10:22.317 --> 10:24.319
Yeah.

10:24.362 --> 10:25.494
Let'’s party.

10:35.286 --> 10:37.201
Leave that alone.

10:40.552 --> 10:42.293
-I said leave it!
-Kwan Ha.

10:46.210 --> 10:47.864
How do you know my name?

10:51.781 --> 10:53.043
Hey!

11:06.361 --> 11:08.406
You'’re the women my father
came out here to see...

11:09.538 --> 11:11.192
aren'’t you?

11:11.235 --> 11:13.585
I am Desiderata.

11:14.891 --> 11:16.197
My father'’s dead now.

11:18.373 --> 11:20.114
He was killed
defending Madrigal...

11:21.681 --> 11:23.683
because of something
you told him.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.511
This place changed him.

11:26.555 --> 11:28.644
I want to know
what you said to him.

11:28.688 --> 11:29.906
And why should we tell you?

11:29.950 --> 11:31.125
Because...

11:33.518 --> 11:35.433
because I'’m going to finish
what he started.

11:35.477 --> 11:37.566
It didn'’t start
with your father.

11:39.133 --> 11:41.657
There were others
in your family before him.

11:41.701 --> 11:44.007
I'’m all that's left
of my family.

11:45.792 --> 11:47.228
Everyone else is dead, so...

11:48.795 --> 11:51.145
tell me what you told
my father.

11:51.188 --> 11:53.321
Please.

11:55.323 --> 11:56.716
You'’re not ready.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.763
I'’m not a child. I...

12:00.807 --> 12:03.635
I came all this way
by myself.

12:03.679 --> 12:05.420
I'’ve risked everything
looking for you!

12:05.463 --> 12:06.813
You'’re not ready.

12:06.856 --> 12:08.771
I took on a man twice my size
and won.

12:08.815 --> 12:11.252
I'’ll fight you all
if I have to!

12:14.559 --> 12:18.389
Your rage blinds you
to the truth.

12:19.869 --> 12:21.131
Rage...

12:22.567 --> 12:24.134
is all I have left.

12:30.575 --> 12:31.489
Madrigal.

12:32.926 --> 12:36.930
Here I have been hurled
headlong, flaming,

12:36.973 --> 12:39.889
from the ethereal sky

12:39.933 --> 12:42.457
with hideous ruin
and combustion

12:42.500 --> 12:46.243
down to bottomless perdition,
there to dwell.

12:47.636 --> 12:52.597
A dungeon, horrible,
on all sides,

12:52.641 --> 12:55.731
as one great furnace flamed.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.907
Yet from those flames,
no light...

12:59.430 --> 13:02.129
but rather darkness, visible.

13:03.695 --> 13:06.046
Better to reign in hell.

13:06.089 --> 13:07.221
Touché.

13:09.223 --> 13:11.747
You'’re certain that the pirate
left Madrigal by himself?

13:11.791 --> 13:15.403
The cargo captain swore to it
under vigorous questioning.

13:15.446 --> 13:19.276
Little Kwan Ha,
all alone in the wide world.

13:21.017 --> 13:22.714
You suppose she went
looking for them?

13:22.758 --> 13:24.804
If we couldn'’t find them,
she won'’t.

13:24.847 --> 13:27.981
Besides, those desert witches
didn'’t do her father any good.

13:28.024 --> 13:31.288
Those witches are what made
Jin Ha so dangerous.

13:32.637 --> 13:34.204
Franco failed me, Pete,

13:34.248 --> 13:36.206
and you will not
make the same mistake.

13:36.250 --> 13:38.165
We come at her hard this time.

13:38.208 --> 13:39.601
Yes, sir.

13:39.644 --> 13:41.516
She will find no safe haven.

14:00.535 --> 14:02.450
Outta the way!

14:02.493 --> 14:03.799
Come on!

14:04.887 --> 14:06.367
Hola, guapa.Huh?

14:10.588 --> 14:14.462
Hey, ladies,
what'’s happening, huh? Nice.

14:14.505 --> 14:15.855
What the hell?

14:17.813 --> 14:19.467
Kids.

14:28.215 --> 14:29.477
Get to work.

14:42.011 --> 14:43.230
Just in time.

15:04.338 --> 15:05.948
You know, Squirrel,
I'’ve been thinking.

15:05.992 --> 15:08.951
Soren, I was drunk,
and I just got out of line--

15:08.995 --> 15:11.084
I'’ve been thinking...

15:14.130 --> 15:17.568
I haven'’t appreciated you enough
for all that you'’ve done.

15:17.612 --> 15:22.269
In fact, I'’ve been taking you
for granted.

15:24.140 --> 15:26.708
Well, it'’s...
It'’s all right.

15:26.751 --> 15:28.231
Don'’t worry, boss.

15:28.275 --> 15:31.017
I got another tug
ready to go.

15:31.060 --> 15:32.975
You still planning
that score?

15:34.150 --> 15:35.369
You'’re serious?

15:37.110 --> 15:38.285
Tell me about it.

15:40.200 --> 15:42.071
It'’s a UNSC cargo ship.

15:42.115 --> 15:45.379
My guy says they only got
one security officer on board.

15:45.422 --> 15:46.946
What are they hauling?

15:48.034 --> 15:50.688
That'’s the best part.

15:50.732 --> 15:54.127
Military-grade slipspace
engine drivers.

15:54.170 --> 15:56.607
Imagine if we got our hands
on one of those.

15:56.651 --> 15:58.783
Nobody could outrun us.

15:58.827 --> 16:01.612
This is the big score
we'’ve been looking for, boss.

16:03.049 --> 16:04.311
And I'’ve thought of everything.

16:05.529 --> 16:06.791
Let'’s do some business.

16:19.848 --> 16:22.068
Madrigal
was once very different.

16:24.157 --> 16:26.768
Barren and unforgiving.

16:28.509 --> 16:31.773
Food was scarce,
water even scarcer.

16:33.644 --> 16:35.603
Life was a struggle
for the first pioneers.

16:35.646 --> 16:39.085
Your forefather'’s forefather
was one of them.

16:40.782 --> 16:43.306
One night, he left his tribe
in search of water.

16:44.612 --> 16:47.136
He walked deep into the desert

16:47.180 --> 16:48.572
and dug a well.

16:48.616 --> 16:51.836
There he discovered the fuel

16:51.880 --> 16:54.361
that now sustains
the planet.

16:55.753 --> 16:57.625
But his reward
was so much greater.

16:59.453 --> 17:02.108
At the well,
he said he met a being...

17:03.196 --> 17:05.372
a visitor from another time.

17:05.415 --> 17:07.852
Perhaps from
another existence.

17:07.896 --> 17:12.596
It explained to him
his true purpose,

17:12.640 --> 17:14.250
his responsibility...

17:16.165 --> 17:19.168
which has been handed on
to future generations.

17:20.474 --> 17:21.823
To your father...

17:23.433 --> 17:25.305
and now to you.

17:28.308 --> 17:29.657
So, what is it?

17:40.711 --> 17:43.845
You say you'’re ready.
Let'’s find out.

17:43.888 --> 17:45.716
I'’m not afraid.

18:07.869 --> 18:09.305
No, no.

18:09.349 --> 18:10.567
No, no, no, no, no!

18:10.611 --> 18:11.568
Hey! Hey!

18:11.612 --> 18:13.004
Hey!

18:14.180 --> 18:15.572
Master Chief!

18:18.749 --> 18:19.794
I don'’t understand.

18:19.837 --> 18:21.230
Wait, wait!

18:25.191 --> 18:27.497
Master Chief,
what'’s happening?

18:28.672 --> 18:29.804
Why are we back here?

18:31.327 --> 18:32.415
Master Chief!

18:55.656 --> 18:56.787
Chief, wait.

19:00.965 --> 19:02.097
Master Chief!

19:06.145 --> 19:08.059
Why won'’t you talk to me?

19:16.677 --> 19:18.287
-Ah!
-What are you doing here?

19:18.331 --> 19:20.028
Kwan Ha.

19:20.071 --> 19:22.378
Oh! Yes, you are Kwan Ha.

19:23.945 --> 19:26.904
Our star attraction!

19:26.948 --> 19:28.776
Make room! I have
important business here!

19:28.819 --> 19:30.212
Back up, back up!

19:30.256 --> 19:31.822
Form a circle!

19:31.866 --> 19:33.084
What did you do to me?

19:33.128 --> 19:34.347
Give the girl some space!

19:34.390 --> 19:35.652
What was in that drink?

19:35.696 --> 19:36.871
Come on, form a circle!

19:36.914 --> 19:38.264
Give this girl some room!

19:39.917 --> 19:42.703
Fair fight! Fair fight!
Fair fight!

19:42.746 --> 19:43.921
Fight?

19:48.274 --> 19:49.666
This...

19:49.710 --> 19:51.277
this is a mistake.

19:52.843 --> 19:55.368
Let'’s see how your rage
serves you.

20:02.070 --> 20:05.291
Ladies and gentlewomen,
we have a fight on our hands!

20:35.799 --> 20:36.931
No--

20:38.237 --> 20:39.673
Again.

20:46.332 --> 20:49.378
Try not to die
so quickly this time.

21:15.578 --> 21:16.579
Again.

21:19.016 --> 21:21.192
Princess,
you'’re dying out there.

21:21.236 --> 21:23.586
I am not a princess!

21:59.622 --> 22:01.363
What do you want from me?

22:07.108 --> 22:09.066
What do you want?

23:04.774 --> 23:06.559
Are you talking to me?

23:19.572 --> 23:20.834
Who are you?

23:59.699 --> 24:00.961
Papa?

24:01.004 --> 24:02.919
Kwan Ha.

24:02.963 --> 24:04.486
Papa!

24:11.798 --> 24:13.234
Kwan Ha.

25:35.011 --> 25:36.709
Let them come.

25:48.503 --> 25:49.765
Go back, Kwan.

25:51.506 --> 25:54.944
Go back to where
it all began.

25:59.296 --> 26:00.428
Kwan...

26:07.957 --> 26:09.263
I'’m a Protector.

26:11.744 --> 26:13.833
Your father told you
where to go.

26:16.096 --> 26:17.924
Back to where
it all began.

26:20.056 --> 26:21.231
So, go.

26:44.124 --> 26:45.995
On your knees! Get down!

26:46.039 --> 26:48.302
Get down!
I didn'’t tell you to get up!

26:48.345 --> 26:50.043
All yours, boss.

26:54.264 --> 26:55.962
Hello, gorgeous.

26:58.094 --> 26:59.574
Good for you, Squirrel.

27:00.749 --> 27:01.707
There you go!
Come on!

27:03.447 --> 27:05.624
Come on!
Keep coming!

27:05.667 --> 27:10.106
Little more. Little more.
Move your ass! Get over there!

27:10.150 --> 27:12.848
-Come on, little more. Go on.
-It'’s stuck.

27:15.024 --> 27:16.460
Is he okay?

27:20.029 --> 27:21.988
Willy, Chaser,
and the rest of you,

27:22.031 --> 27:24.381
get these boxes
and put '’em on my rig!

27:25.687 --> 27:27.428
Help me!

27:27.471 --> 27:29.473
Trokan, why don'’t you help
the fellas out.

27:31.737 --> 27:32.912
Trokan.

27:34.043 --> 27:35.262
I'’m sorry.

27:39.614 --> 27:42.051
You thought you could
fill my shoes?

27:54.977 --> 27:56.979
Was that
really necessary?

27:57.023 --> 28:00.026
-He could lose his toes.
-Good.

28:00.069 --> 28:03.116
That'’ll teach him to think
before every step he takes.

28:06.206 --> 28:07.511
And the others?

28:07.555 --> 28:09.296
They got to learn.

28:09.339 --> 28:11.385
And what are they learning?

28:11.428 --> 28:13.213
Who'’s in charge,
for starters.

28:15.041 --> 28:16.477
I'’ve been too easy on 'em.

28:18.740 --> 28:21.743
Fear is a hell of a motivator.

28:21.787 --> 28:23.571
Trust me.

28:23.614 --> 28:24.746
Soren.

28:28.881 --> 28:31.361
-Soren.
-It'’s that girl.

28:31.405 --> 28:34.495
That pain-in-the-ass
little girl.

28:38.020 --> 28:39.630
Ah, shit,
it doesn'’t matter now.

28:39.674 --> 28:41.502
She'’s all alone out there.

28:41.545 --> 28:44.723
If the desert doesn'’t get her,
Vinsher'’s goons

28:44.766 --> 28:46.986
have probably already
found her and carved her up.

28:47.029 --> 28:49.423
Kwan Ha is alive.

28:49.466 --> 28:51.512
How do you know?

28:51.555 --> 28:54.820
Because Vinsher
just tripled the bounty.

28:56.735 --> 28:58.606
Tripled.

29:00.695 --> 29:02.044
That damn girl.

29:15.188 --> 29:17.581
-Agatha! Hello!
-Oh, hello!

29:17.625 --> 29:18.887
Come on.

29:22.673 --> 29:25.024
Ah, General...

29:25.067 --> 29:27.504
did I catch you
at a good time?

30:20.253 --> 30:21.863
Such a tragedy.

30:21.907 --> 30:23.473
So much death.

30:25.388 --> 30:26.868
And, in the end,

30:26.912 --> 30:29.915
it wasn'’t even the UNSC
that did Jin in.

30:29.958 --> 30:31.394
Stubborn fool.

30:31.438 --> 30:33.179
Never could tell
who his real friends were.

30:34.702 --> 30:36.747
Jin knew whom
he could trust...

30:38.010 --> 30:39.620
and who'’d betray him.

30:39.663 --> 30:41.709
It was his delusions
that betrayed him.

30:41.752 --> 30:45.669
Tell me, General,
and be honest,

30:45.713 --> 30:48.411
what good did Jin Ha do
for Madrigal?

30:48.455 --> 30:51.632
-He gave us pride.
-Pride?

30:51.675 --> 30:53.939
That'’s not a word
that I would associate

30:53.982 --> 30:56.767
with a colony
of hole-diggers.

30:57.899 --> 31:00.075
And what did this pride bring?

31:00.119 --> 31:02.773
Jin had them stop drilling
for the only resource

31:02.817 --> 31:05.124
their filthy planet produced
and take up arms.

31:05.167 --> 31:06.908
No. Not stop drilling.

31:06.952 --> 31:10.390
Just protect certain areas
for the people of Madrigal.

31:10.433 --> 31:11.608
Agatha...

31:12.958 --> 31:16.918
You and I knew
Jin Ha very well.

31:16.962 --> 31:18.311
This was a sick man,

31:18.354 --> 31:20.704
as was the whole Ha family.

31:20.748 --> 31:23.925
Sick, delusional, and weak.

31:23.969 --> 31:26.710
And yet you are
so deathly afraid of them.

31:35.719 --> 31:38.244
Where is the girl?

31:38.287 --> 31:41.160
Even if I knew,

31:41.203 --> 31:42.944
I wouldn'’t tell you.

31:45.251 --> 31:46.426
Boss.

31:55.043 --> 31:57.437
Now, if there'’s
nothing else you require,

31:57.480 --> 31:59.613
I really must get
my perishables stored.

32:00.744 --> 32:01.920
Yes, yes, of course.

32:11.146 --> 32:12.626
Fetch the car, Pete.

34:41.818 --> 34:43.037
What are you doing here?

34:43.081 --> 34:44.299
Like I told you,

34:44.343 --> 34:45.692
you owe me one ship

34:45.735 --> 34:47.259
and a shitload
of deuterium money.

34:47.302 --> 34:49.304
I'’m not going back
with you.

34:49.348 --> 34:51.219
You might want
to consider your options

34:51.263 --> 34:53.308
'’cause if I found you,
Vinsher can'’t be far behind.

34:53.352 --> 34:54.962
And he don'’t travel solo.

34:55.005 --> 34:57.530
Ah. It'’s the bounty
you'’re after?

34:57.573 --> 34:59.532
I don'’t work like that.

34:59.575 --> 35:01.403
That'’s exactly
how you work.

35:03.623 --> 35:05.103
You wanna insult me,

35:05.146 --> 35:06.626
or you gonna let me
save your ass?

35:08.193 --> 35:09.716
I'’m doing just fine
on my own, thanks.

35:09.759 --> 35:11.413
And yet, here we are.

35:13.763 --> 35:17.593
Look, maybe you'’re too young
or too stupid to understand,

35:17.637 --> 35:20.205
but I made a promise to John
to keep you safe,

35:20.248 --> 35:22.120
and I intend to keep it,
whether I like you or not.

35:26.254 --> 35:28.038
You'’re not exactly
a picnic either.

35:28.082 --> 35:29.997
My pistol.

35:31.694 --> 35:34.306
-Oh, it'’s like that?
-Yeah, it'’s like that.

35:34.349 --> 35:35.829
-You just have to be difficult.
-Me?

35:35.872 --> 35:37.744
-You should talk!
-Kwan!

35:37.787 --> 35:39.224
Damn it.

35:39.267 --> 35:40.834
Let'’s move.

35:40.877 --> 35:42.270
Kwan Ha!

35:43.445 --> 35:46.274
Last of the Has.

35:46.318 --> 35:49.495
The pernicious hour
is at last upon us.

35:51.192 --> 35:54.152
Time to put away
childish things.

35:54.195 --> 35:57.503
There is no hope for escape.

35:57.546 --> 35:59.200
Okay.

35:59.244 --> 36:02.029
Sit your ass down,
stay low,

36:02.072 --> 36:03.726
and start killing people.

36:03.770 --> 36:04.988
You'’ll die.

36:05.032 --> 36:06.207
Not a chance.

36:06.251 --> 36:08.166
We'’ll both die.

36:08.209 --> 36:09.819
You got a better idea?

36:09.863 --> 36:11.430
'’Cause they're coming in fast.

36:12.996 --> 36:14.389
Let them come.

36:14.433 --> 36:16.130
Say what, now?

36:16.174 --> 36:18.654
All the hydrogen gas
runs through here

36:18.698 --> 36:21.048
to the main Sky Pipe
out there.

36:21.091 --> 36:23.224
We fill up the pipe
and then shoot it.

36:23.268 --> 36:26.140
Bam, the whole place
goes up in flames.

36:26.184 --> 36:28.882
-No more Vinsher.
-And no more us.

36:28.925 --> 36:30.840
There'’s a steel vault
a hundred feet across the way.

36:30.884 --> 36:32.973
-I see it.
-As long as we'’re inside

36:33.016 --> 36:35.976
the vault when the pipe
explodes, we'’re probably safe.

36:36.019 --> 36:37.369
Probably.

36:37.412 --> 36:39.588
You wanted a plan?
That'’s it.

36:39.632 --> 36:43.505
If we are going to fight,
we meet them on my terms.

36:43.549 --> 36:46.334
The people
of Madrigal need you!

36:48.945 --> 36:50.251
-Come out.
-All right.

36:50.295 --> 36:51.774
Join us!

36:51.818 --> 36:53.950
Long as I still get to kill
some people.

36:53.994 --> 36:55.343
No harm will come to you.

36:55.387 --> 36:57.998
Of that, I give you
my solemn word.

37:01.480 --> 37:03.569
I loved your father, Kwan.

37:05.658 --> 37:07.268
He was like a brother to me.

37:12.230 --> 37:14.580
This is Kwan Ha,

37:14.623 --> 37:16.799
daughter of Jin Ha.

37:18.279 --> 37:20.673
Madrigal does not
belong to you.

37:20.716 --> 37:23.371
It does not belong
to the UNSC.

37:23.415 --> 37:26.113
It belongs to the people
of Madrigal.

37:27.854 --> 37:31.379
I don'’t want to fight you,
but I will never...

37:32.467 --> 37:34.252
never surrender.

37:34.295 --> 37:35.992
Also, Vinsher...

37:37.124 --> 37:40.606
my dad hated you.

37:41.694 --> 37:42.782
Send them in.

37:58.580 --> 38:00.930
-Uh-oh.
-What do you mean, "uh-oh"?

38:00.974 --> 38:02.671
The gas isn'’t flowing.

38:02.715 --> 38:04.456
Why not?

38:04.499 --> 38:06.458
The valve at the base
of the Sky Pipe must be closed.

38:06.501 --> 38:08.242
I'’ll have to open it manually.

38:08.286 --> 38:09.852
I'’ll open the valve.

38:09.896 --> 38:11.941
-You go to the vault.
-No! I'’ll open it.

38:11.985 --> 38:14.422
Oh, okay. You.

38:14.466 --> 38:16.163
You won'’t make it 10 feet
out there.

38:16.206 --> 38:18.296
I know another way.

38:21.864 --> 38:24.171
Soon as I get the gas flowing,
I'’ll make a break for the vault.

38:24.214 --> 38:25.868
Count to five
and take the shot

38:25.912 --> 38:27.566
right at the base
of the Sky Pipe.

38:27.609 --> 38:29.959
-Got it?
-Yeah.

38:30.003 --> 38:31.918
Make sure you'’re in the vault
when the pipe explodes.

38:31.961 --> 38:33.441
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I know, boom.

38:35.313 --> 38:36.401
Oh...

38:38.011 --> 38:39.839
You'’ve got to be kidding me.

38:41.362 --> 38:42.885
Told you I was rich.

38:54.810 --> 38:56.464
Hold your fire!

38:58.727 --> 39:01.077
We got '’em surrounded!

39:01.121 --> 39:02.688
Clear the building!

39:02.731 --> 39:04.559
Eyes up there.
I need eyes there.

39:06.692 --> 39:09.172
Hey. See you at the vault?

39:09.216 --> 39:11.566
Save a bullet
for the Sky Pipe.

39:16.571 --> 39:18.617
Fan out!

39:36.852 --> 39:38.376
So these are the aliens.

39:39.638 --> 39:40.987
Ugly bastards.

39:41.030 --> 39:42.423
Let'’s go, let's go!

39:47.297 --> 39:48.211
Go left!

39:55.784 --> 39:57.307
Pirate!

40:15.282 --> 40:16.588
Where is he?!

40:42.788 --> 40:45.051
Okay... this way.

41:16.822 --> 41:18.693
He'’s over here!

41:43.370 --> 41:45.198
He'’s everywhere, boss.

41:45.241 --> 41:47.069
-And the girl?
-I don'’t know.

41:47.113 --> 41:48.680
Get the girl!

42:02.737 --> 42:04.391
Look back there!

42:28.284 --> 42:29.895
She'’s right there!

42:43.604 --> 42:45.040
Right there! Right there!

43:06.235 --> 43:07.585
Save one for the Sky Pipe.

43:09.369 --> 43:10.500
This better work.

43:36.526 --> 43:37.615
I got her!

43:52.542 --> 43:53.892
What the hell is this?

43:53.935 --> 43:55.676
Get this thing off me.

43:55.720 --> 43:57.330
Where are you going?

43:57.373 --> 43:58.418
Damn it--

44:15.261 --> 44:16.784
Hold your fire!

44:23.748 --> 44:25.358
Kwan!

44:27.665 --> 44:32.408
Your adventure has come
to its inevitable conclusion.

44:35.411 --> 44:36.717
Come now.

44:38.937 --> 44:40.634
Show yourself.

44:43.506 --> 44:48.337
Let us end this contretemps
with some degree of dignity.

44:56.781 --> 44:59.871
And what of you,
poor Soren?

45:01.263 --> 45:03.526
Thou proud aspirer.

45:03.570 --> 45:05.180
Failed Spartan,

45:05.224 --> 45:07.052
mediocre pirate,

45:07.095 --> 45:11.056
and now martyr for the delusion
of an orphaned young girl.

45:14.059 --> 45:16.235
What kind of fool
does that make you?

45:17.845 --> 45:20.543
A fool thinks himself
to be wise,

45:20.587 --> 45:24.809
but a wise man knows himself
to be a fool.

45:25.940 --> 45:28.726
Or at least he should.

45:38.039 --> 45:39.998
-Come on, kid.

47:17.791 --> 47:19.314
-You sure you don'’t want

47:19.358 --> 47:21.099
to keep some of this cash?

47:21.142 --> 47:22.622
It'’s more
than we agreed to,

47:22.665 --> 47:25.625
and you'’re gonna
need some.

47:25.668 --> 47:27.018
I owe you one ship,

47:27.061 --> 47:28.802
plus a shitload
of deuterium money.

47:28.846 --> 47:30.108
Consider us even.

47:31.544 --> 47:32.719
Yeah, okay.

47:35.591 --> 47:36.723
I could use you...

47:37.855 --> 47:39.030
for whatever comes next.

47:39.073 --> 47:40.292
I'’m sure you could.

47:40.335 --> 47:41.902
But I got my own thing going,

47:41.946 --> 47:45.601
and I'’m not one
for joining lost causes.

47:46.776 --> 47:48.604
I don'’t believe that.

47:49.867 --> 47:51.042
Take care, kid.

47:54.654 --> 47:55.873
We'’ll see each other again.

47:55.916 --> 47:57.613
God, I hope not.
