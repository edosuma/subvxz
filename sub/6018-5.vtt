00:04.571 --> 00:06.471
Love seat is interesting.
Some guy thought:

00:06.639 --> 00:09.665
"If they won't sit closer to us
why not just shorten the furniture?"

00:09.843 --> 00:12.971
My favorite furniture brand
is the La-Z-Boy.

00:13.146 --> 00:16.309
This is very flattering
to the prospective customer, isn't it?

00:17.150 --> 00:21.109
Why not call it the half-conscious-
deadbeat-with-no-job-home-all-day...

00:21.287 --> 00:24.950
...eating-Cheetos
and-watching-TV recliner?

00:25.125 --> 00:27.923
And it goes back so far, that thing.

00:28.094 --> 00:32.223
I mean, go to bed already.
It's over. You're wiped.

00:36.970 --> 00:39.063
So she got you to join a book club?

00:39.239 --> 00:43.300
I got a feeling I'm gonna be
much smarter than you pretty soon.

00:43.476 --> 00:48.379
Well, I think that statement alone
reflects your burgeoning intelligence.

00:48.548 --> 00:50.880
-What about this one?
-No, I don't like that one.

00:51.051 --> 00:55.511
-So, what's your first book?
-<i>Breakfast at Tiffany's</i>. Ninety pages.

00:56.923 --> 01:00.222
-It's kind of old, isn't it?
-They wanted a Truman Capote book.

01:00.760 --> 01:02.227
Oh, sure, Truman Capote.

01:02.395 --> 01:03.885
-He's a great writer.
-Oh, yeah.

01:04.063 --> 01:05.827
-Ever read anything by him?
-No. You?

01:05.999 --> 01:08.058
No.

01:08.701 --> 01:10.464
What about this one?

01:10.637 --> 01:12.468
Look at this. This is it.

01:12.639 --> 01:15.267
This is what I'm looking for.

01:15.442 --> 01:16.932
Oh, yeah.

01:18.611 --> 01:20.442
-Hey, what's going on?
-New couch, baby.

01:20.613 --> 01:22.604
New couch? Why?

01:22.782 --> 01:25.546
I love this couch. The best part is
it doesn't fold out...

01:25.718 --> 01:28.084
...so no one can sleep over.

01:30.990 --> 01:32.753
Hello.

01:33.059 --> 01:34.356
Hello.

01:34.527 --> 01:36.757
Oh, let me get the door for you.

01:39.365 --> 01:41.060
Be careful.

01:41.234 --> 01:43.498
Wait till you see it. It's perfect.

01:43.670 --> 01:46.434
The guy told me it's one of a kind.
They stopped making it.

01:46.606 --> 01:48.130
What are you doing
with your old couch?

01:48.308 --> 01:50.333
The moving guys are taking it.
You want it?

01:50.510 --> 01:51.841
Yeah, I'll take it.

01:52.011 --> 01:53.842
I'm sure they can deliver it to you.

01:54.681 --> 01:56.376
Yes, they can.

01:57.250 --> 01:59.013
-Hey, couch is coming.
-It's here.

01:59.185 --> 02:02.120
All right. Yeah. You know,
I'm excited about this, Jerry.

02:02.288 --> 02:04.279
In a way, I feel like I'm getting
a new couch.

02:04.457 --> 02:05.981
Yeah, so do l.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.454
You remember Poppie?

02:08.928 --> 02:11.055
-You mean from Poppie's restaurant?
-Yeah, yeah.

02:11.231 --> 02:13.631
Anyway, we're going
into business together.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.427
Remember my idea
about the place...

02:15.602 --> 02:18.298
-...where you make your own pizza?
-What was that again?

02:18.471 --> 02:20.769
It's a pizza place
where you make your own pie.

02:20.940 --> 02:23.204
We give you the dough,
the sauce, the cheese.

02:23.376 --> 02:27.676
You pound it, slap it,
you flip it up into the air...

02:27.847 --> 02:31.681
...put your toppings on,
and you slide it into the oven.

02:31.851 --> 02:33.580
That sounds good, huh?

02:33.753 --> 02:37.416
I can't wait to get me a fella
and make my own pie.

02:38.258 --> 02:39.919
What made you resurrect
that old idea?

02:40.093 --> 02:42.084
Well, I happened to be
eating at Poppie's...

02:42.262 --> 02:44.890
...when I told him the old idea
and his eyes:

02:45.632 --> 02:46.860
Just lit up.

02:47.033 --> 02:50.332
-You know, he wants to back it.
-I heard Poppie's was good. Let's go.

02:50.503 --> 02:53.495
I'm not going. Didn't he get busted
by the board of health?

02:53.673 --> 02:55.368
No, that was in the past, Jerry.

02:55.542 --> 02:58.773
As it happens, <i>New York</i> magazine
just judged his kitchen...

02:58.945 --> 03:00.776
...to be one of the cleanest
in the city.

03:00.947 --> 03:04.246
They got a duck there, you think
you died and went to heaven.

03:05.051 --> 03:07.246
I love duck. Come on, come on.

03:07.420 --> 03:09.149
You gotta order it
two days in advance.

03:09.322 --> 03:11.256
I'll call them,
I'll order the duck for you.

03:11.424 --> 03:13.358
Kramer, l--

03:18.831 --> 03:21.561
Right there, guys. That's perfect.

03:22.502 --> 03:23.969
What do you think, Lainey?

03:24.137 --> 03:26.469
Well, I don't know.
I'll have to sit on it.

03:26.639 --> 03:28.664
Oh, no, I don't want anyone
sitting on it.

03:29.409 --> 03:30.933
Sign here.

03:31.844 --> 03:34.210
Excuse me. I was wondering
if it would be possible...

03:34.380 --> 03:37.008
...if you could you deliver
the old couch to my apartment?

03:37.183 --> 03:38.810
-It's not very far.
-Sure.

03:38.985 --> 03:42.113
Okay. You got room in the truck
for me?

03:44.057 --> 03:45.422
I think we can squeeze you in.

03:45.592 --> 03:49.460
Oh, goody. Okay. Well...

03:49.629 --> 03:52.496
...I'll see you chumps later.

03:53.866 --> 03:55.663
Did you offer those guys a drink?

03:55.835 --> 03:57.666
No. Should I have?

03:57.837 --> 04:01.603
-What kind of a person are you?
-I don't know.

04:02.308 --> 04:04.003
Okay, <i>Breakfast at Tiffany's</i>.

04:06.000 --> 04:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here

04:19.524 --> 04:21.288
So he puts the couch down...

04:21.461 --> 04:25.864
...and just as he's about to leave,
he says, "Do you date moving men?"

04:28.401 --> 04:30.835
-You wanna know what I said?
-I can't wait.

04:31.004 --> 04:33.234
"l do now."

04:34.040 --> 04:35.632
-Clever.
-Is that something?

04:35.808 --> 04:38.675
-Is that something?
-Yes, you're something.

04:40.046 --> 04:42.344
So anyway, when they
were in my house before...

04:42.515 --> 04:45.211
...I didn't offer them
anything to drink.

04:45.385 --> 04:48.115
Well, they're real men, Jerry.
They get sweaty.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.984
So anyone sweaty in your house
has to be offered a drink?

04:51.157 --> 04:52.624
Yes.

04:53.259 --> 04:54.624
Would you apologize for me?

04:55.261 --> 04:59.561
Hello. Jerry, so good
to see you again.

05:00.233 --> 05:01.894
Hello...

05:02.068 --> 05:03.433
...Poppie.

05:03.603 --> 05:05.935
-This is Elaine.
-Nice to meet you, Poppie.

05:06.105 --> 05:08.801
-Let me show you to your table.
-Okay.

05:08.975 --> 05:11.876
Your duck is cooking
as we speak.

05:12.045 --> 05:15.742
It is so succulent, so succulent.

05:16.416 --> 05:19.078
So Kramer told us all about
your business venture together.

05:19.252 --> 05:22.551
Your friend and I are gonna make
a lot of money.

05:23.489 --> 05:26.253
Of course,
I already have a lot of money.

05:26.426 --> 05:28.792
Poppie does very well.

05:28.961 --> 05:30.895
Very well.

05:31.931 --> 05:34.991
Well, your mother must be
very proud of you.

05:36.969 --> 05:40.234
My mother
was taken from my house...

05:40.406 --> 05:42.840
...by the communists
in the middle of the night...

05:43.009 --> 05:45.569
...when I was 10 years old.

05:45.745 --> 05:48.680
She was sent
to a slave-labor camp...

05:48.848 --> 05:51.715
...where she labored for 12 years.

05:51.884 --> 05:54.853
Finally, they released her...

05:55.021 --> 05:58.855
...and she was on a boat to America
to reunite with us.

05:59.025 --> 06:05.521
But she was served some bad fish,
and she died on the high seas.

06:09.836 --> 06:11.963
So, what's good tonight?

06:24.851 --> 06:26.876
Boy, I'm really looking forward
to this duck.

06:27.053 --> 06:29.954
I've never had food
ordered in advance before.

06:30.123 --> 06:32.614
Could have stayed home
and ordered pizza from Pokeno's.

06:33.726 --> 06:36.820
Pokeno's? Oh, no. You should never
order pizza from Pokeno's.

06:36.996 --> 06:40.022
-Why not?
-The owner contributes money...

06:40.199 --> 06:42.224
...to those fanatical
anti-abortion groups.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.597
-So you won't eat the pizza?
-No way.

06:44.771 --> 06:46.068
-Really?
-Yeah.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.366
Well, what if...

06:48.541 --> 06:50.600
...Poppie felt the same way?

06:50.777 --> 06:53.610
Well, I guess I wouldn't
eat here then.

06:53.780 --> 06:55.247
Really?

06:55.415 --> 06:56.746
Yeah, that's right.

06:56.916 --> 06:58.941
Well, perhaps we should inquire.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.316
Poppie? Oh, Poppie?

07:02.688 --> 07:06.647
-Could I have a word?
-Yes, Jerry. I just checked your duck.

07:06.826 --> 07:09.522
It is more succulent
than even I had hoped.

07:09.695 --> 07:13.358
Poppie, I was just curious.
Where do you stand on abortion?

07:13.533 --> 07:16.502
When my mother was abducted
by the communists...

07:16.669 --> 07:18.694
-...she was with a child.
-Oh, boy.

07:18.871 --> 07:21.101
But the communists,
they put an end to that.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.708
So on this issue,
there is no debate...

07:23.876 --> 07:26.868
...and no intelligent person
can think differently.

07:27.680 --> 07:31.446
Well, Poppie, I think differently.

07:31.617 --> 07:33.380
And what gives you
the right to do that?

07:34.687 --> 07:38.020
The Supreme Court gives me the right
to do that!

07:38.191 --> 07:39.488
Let's go, Jerry. Come on.

07:39.859 --> 07:41.952
I heard that. Let's go, Henry.

07:42.128 --> 07:44.995
-We just got here.
-I'm with you, Poppie.

07:45.164 --> 07:48.292
-Let's go.
-And I am not coming back!

07:48.468 --> 07:50.299
You're not welcome!

07:54.874 --> 07:57.536
Well, I'm certainly glad
I brought it up.

08:00.313 --> 08:03.407
Well, you should've seen it.
It was quite a scene over there.

08:03.583 --> 08:06.245
-I'm sorry I missed it.
-Oh, you really missed something.

08:06.419 --> 08:08.444
And I have to say...

08:08.621 --> 08:11.021
...it was pretty much all my fault.

08:13.459 --> 08:15.051
So how's the book coming?

08:18.164 --> 08:21.156
-I say how's the book coming?
-Oh, pretty good.

08:22.001 --> 08:22.990
So, what's it about?

08:23.836 --> 08:26.270
-Well, it's about Holly Golightly.
-Holly Golightly.

08:26.439 --> 08:29.272
-Yeah, she's quite a character.
-Haven't read a page, have you?

08:29.442 --> 08:32.035
-No.
-Big surprise.

08:32.211 --> 08:36.705
I couldn't. If it's not about sports,
I find it very hard to concentrate.

08:37.283 --> 08:39.717
You're not very bright, are you?

08:40.620 --> 08:42.280
No, I'm not.

08:42.455 --> 08:44.980
I would like to be, but I'm not.

08:45.491 --> 08:47.891
What am I gonna do?
The book club meets in a few days.

08:48.294 --> 08:50.091
Why don't you rent the movie?

08:50.530 --> 08:53.192
Why don't I rent the movie?

08:53.366 --> 08:54.856
You see? This is when I like you.

08:55.034 --> 08:56.524
Now I'm relieved.

08:57.770 --> 08:59.465
So...

09:00.439 --> 09:02.202
...how was the dinner last night?

09:03.576 --> 09:05.043
Oh, well....

09:05.645 --> 09:07.374
Did you enjoy the duck?

09:07.547 --> 09:11.074
Oh, Elaine, I was just asking
how dinner went last night.

09:11.784 --> 09:14.412
-Oh, well--
-All right, what did you do to Poppie?

09:15.288 --> 09:17.654
-Nothing.
-Well, he's in the hospital.

09:17.823 --> 09:19.791
And the cook says
you put him there.

09:20.526 --> 09:22.892
-What's wrong with him?
-I don't know.

09:23.062 --> 09:24.893
I'm gonna go and visit him later.

09:25.064 --> 09:28.898
It would be nice
if you got him something.

09:32.305 --> 09:33.636
We should get him something.

09:33.806 --> 09:36.104
Yeah, you're right.

09:38.244 --> 09:42.977
Do you know I've been using the same
bottle of shampoo for a year?

09:43.282 --> 09:45.341
And I shampoo every day.

09:47.153 --> 09:48.916
So, what do you think
of my conversation?

09:49.088 --> 09:50.851
Not much.

09:54.827 --> 09:57.489
I would've invited you up...

09:57.663 --> 09:59.426
...but I don't have any furniture.

09:59.765 --> 10:04.099
-You don't have any furniture?
-No, I hate furniture. I can't look at it.

10:07.673 --> 10:09.732
Oh, I can understand that.

10:12.311 --> 10:15.803
-A pretty good date, huh?
-Yeah, no heavy lifting.

10:25.825 --> 10:28.623
Anyway, Jerry and Elaine felt bad
about what happened to you...

10:28.794 --> 10:30.352
...and wanted you to have this.

10:32.932 --> 10:34.524
What's this?

10:34.700 --> 10:39.034
A bottle of wine
and a five-alarm chili?

10:39.205 --> 10:40.638
They're trying to kill Poppie?

10:41.440 --> 10:42.907
-Why?
-Don't they know I have...

10:43.075 --> 10:44.804
...a gastrointestinal disorder?

10:45.211 --> 10:48.203
If I would have any of this,
I would die.

10:48.381 --> 10:50.576
Then Poppie's no good to anyone.

10:50.750 --> 10:53.844
This is a sick, sick joke on Poppie.

10:54.720 --> 10:57.746
How could you be friends
with those two?

10:57.923 --> 10:59.891
Well, we're not very close.

11:00.426 --> 11:03.088
-They owe me for those ducks.
-Yeah.

11:03.262 --> 11:06.322
-They're flown in from Newfoundland.
-They got good ducks there, huh?

11:06.499 --> 11:08.660
Very good ducks.

11:11.637 --> 11:13.764
I'm in love!

11:15.241 --> 11:17.971
This is it, Jerry! This is it!

11:18.144 --> 11:19.839
He is such an incredible person.

11:20.012 --> 11:22.981
He's real. He's honest.
He's unpretentious.

11:23.149 --> 11:24.844
Oh, I'm really lucky.

11:26.085 --> 11:28.178
Did you tell him I was sorry
about the drink?

11:28.354 --> 11:29.946
No. I forgot.

11:30.122 --> 11:33.182
The best part is,
he doesn't play games.

11:33.359 --> 11:35.054
You know? There are no games.

11:35.227 --> 11:38.355
No games? What is the point
of dating without games?

11:38.531 --> 11:40.795
How do you know
if you're winning or losing?

11:40.966 --> 11:42.194
Well, all I know is...

11:42.368 --> 11:44.666
...he doesn't like games,
and he doesn't play games.

11:44.837 --> 11:47.237
You know, he has too much character
and integrity.

11:48.374 --> 11:52.208
And what is his stand on abortion?

11:56.315 --> 11:58.044
What?

11:59.552 --> 12:01.816
What is his stand...

12:01.987 --> 12:03.887
...on abortion?

12:07.059 --> 12:10.119
Well, I'm sure he's pro-choice.

12:10.296 --> 12:12.127
How do you know?

12:12.832 --> 12:15.130
Because he....

12:15.301 --> 12:16.893
Well....

12:17.069 --> 12:19.196
He's just so good-looking.

12:20.439 --> 12:22.100
Well, you should probably ask.

12:22.274 --> 12:26.802
Because if he's gonna be coming over
with those Pokeno's pizzas...

12:26.979 --> 12:28.674
...could be trouble.

12:31.884 --> 12:33.613
I'd like to rent
<i>Breakfast at Tiffany's</i>.

12:33.786 --> 12:36.152
This is out. Someone has it.

12:36.322 --> 12:37.812
Out? Oh, no, I've--

12:37.990 --> 12:40.458
I've been to four places.
You're the only ones with it.

12:40.626 --> 12:43.026
Well, I could put it
on reserve for you if you'd like.

12:43.195 --> 12:46.824
Maybe we could call them
and ask them to return it.

12:47.466 --> 12:50.128
Sorry, we can't do that.

12:50.302 --> 12:53.203
Well, maybe they're done with it.
I could go pick it up.

12:53.372 --> 12:56.705
I don't think so.
It doesn't work that way.

13:13.692 --> 13:15.182
<i>Yes?</i>

13:16.428 --> 13:20.364
Excuse me, are you Joe Temple?

13:20.533 --> 13:22.023
<i>Yes.</i>

13:23.502 --> 13:25.868
Yes, you don't know me.

13:26.038 --> 13:28.404
My name is George Costanza.

13:28.574 --> 13:31.702
Did you happen to rent
<i>Breakfast at Tiffany's</i> ?

13:34.880 --> 13:36.177
-Hey.
-What's happening?

13:36.348 --> 13:38.179
Well, you know,
Poppie's over at my place.

13:38.350 --> 13:41.649
Tonight's the big night. I'll make
the first test pizza at the restaurant.

13:41.821 --> 13:45.348
You got a regular Manhattan Project
going on over there.

13:45.524 --> 13:47.890
Anyway, he's about to leave.
He wants the duck money.

13:48.060 --> 13:51.120
-Oh, okay. Hi, Poppie.
-Hello.

13:51.297 --> 13:53.822
Sorry about the gift.
I didn't know about your condition.

13:53.999 --> 13:55.227
That's fine.

13:55.401 --> 13:57.767
If you just give me my duck money,
I'll be on my way.

13:57.937 --> 13:59.837
Okay, I'll get it.

14:00.773 --> 14:03.901
Why don't you sit down, Poppie,
you're still recuperating.

14:12.151 --> 14:14.051
Are you tired, Poppie?

14:14.220 --> 14:17.678
-No.
-Poppie, you really think people...

14:17.857 --> 14:19.256
...wanna make their own pizza?

14:19.425 --> 14:23.156
Kramer, did I ever tell you
about my mother?

14:24.630 --> 14:27.064
-My mother--
-Here you go.

14:27.233 --> 14:30.896
Anyway, I'm sorry again about the....

14:31.070 --> 14:32.435
-The....
-The what?

14:32.605 --> 14:34.232
The....

14:35.741 --> 14:38.232
-The-- The....
-Okay, Poppie. So long, huh?

14:39.078 --> 14:40.602
I'll see you tonight.

14:42.948 --> 14:44.779
Kramer, what is this?

14:44.950 --> 14:47.009
-What is what?
-This puddle on my sofa!

14:47.186 --> 14:49.552
-What puddle?
-That puddle!

14:52.858 --> 14:54.257
I don't know.

14:55.094 --> 14:56.652
Is it...?

14:57.463 --> 14:58.953
Could it...?

14:59.798 --> 15:02.130
Could he have...?

15:02.301 --> 15:03.962
It is!

15:04.136 --> 15:06.764
Poppie peed on my sofa!

15:08.274 --> 15:11.072
-Are you sure?
-Well, what is it, then?

15:14.980 --> 15:18.643
My new sofa!
Poppie peed on my new sofa!

15:18.817 --> 15:20.341
I'm sure it'll come out.

15:20.519 --> 15:23.647
I don't care if it comes out.
I can't sit on that anymore.

15:23.822 --> 15:26.518
-You're making too much of it.
-Yeah, you're right.

15:26.692 --> 15:30.423
Just a natural human function.
Happens to be on my sofa...

15:30.596 --> 15:33.656
...instead of in the toilet,
where it would normally be.

15:34.199 --> 15:35.188
Right.

15:36.168 --> 15:38.830
Well, anyway, the book club
meets tomorrow, Mr. Temple.

15:39.471 --> 15:43.373
Well, I was gonna watch it
with my daughter.

15:43.542 --> 15:45.339
She likes Audrey Hepburn
very much.

15:45.511 --> 15:47.706
Yeah, she was a delicate flower.

15:50.449 --> 15:52.883
Why didn't you just
read the book?

15:54.520 --> 15:58.684
Well, as I say, the pinkeye
made my vision quite blurry.

15:58.857 --> 16:00.415
Remy.

16:00.592 --> 16:03.493
This is George.

16:04.396 --> 16:07.490
Would you mind if he watched
<i>Breakfast at Tiffany's</i> with us?

16:13.172 --> 16:15.140
-Hi.
-Hi.

16:15.941 --> 16:17.841
-I missed you.
-Oh, I missed you.

16:18.010 --> 16:20.103
I don't remember the last time
I felt this way.

16:20.279 --> 16:21.507
Me either.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.841
-I think about you all the time.
-You do?

16:24.016 --> 16:26.450
-Do you think about me?
-Oh, yeah, all the time.

16:26.618 --> 16:27.983
All the time.

16:28.153 --> 16:29.643
Although...

16:29.822 --> 16:32.757
...recently I've been thinking about
this friend of mine.

16:32.925 --> 16:36.520
-What friend?
-Oh, just this woman.

16:36.695 --> 16:40.563
She got impregnated
by her troglodytic half-brother...

16:40.733 --> 16:42.724
...and decided to have an abortion.

16:46.972 --> 16:48.496
You know, someday...

16:48.674 --> 16:52.110
...we're gonna get enough people on
the Supreme Court to change that law.

16:59.084 --> 17:01.882
So anything to nosh?

17:06.258 --> 17:08.385
What did you want?

17:08.560 --> 17:10.186
Popcorn?

17:10.362 --> 17:13.627
Popcorn? Where do you
think you are?

17:13.799 --> 17:15.767
A lot of people keep popcorn
in the house.

17:15.934 --> 17:18.060
Well, we don't.

17:21.173 --> 17:23.164
You might wanna try it.

17:23.509 --> 17:25.374
Makes the movie more enjoyable,
that's all.

17:25.611 --> 17:29.206
-Here's some nuts.
-Oh, nuts! Excellent!

17:30.049 --> 17:33.212
You know what I love? How there's
two nuts named after people:

17:33.385 --> 17:35.580
Hazel and Filbert.

17:37.956 --> 17:41.016
Can we watch
the movie now, Daddy?

17:41.193 --> 17:44.424
Hey, let's turn off the lights,
get some real movie atmosphere.

17:44.596 --> 17:47.030
The lights are fine.

17:50.169 --> 17:52.763
See? Everybody can do this.
Yeah.

17:52.938 --> 17:56.237
No, no. Use your wrist.
It's all in the wrist.

17:56.408 --> 17:58.706
-Oh, yeah.
-Not too high!

17:58.877 --> 18:00.970
Very good. That's very good.

18:01.146 --> 18:03.876
All right,
put a little sauce on here.

18:08.720 --> 18:11.655
-Now some cheese.
-Not too much.

18:11.824 --> 18:13.985
And cucumbers.

18:14.159 --> 18:16.627
Hey, wait a second.
What is that?

18:17.129 --> 18:18.460
-It's cucumbers.
-No, no.

18:18.630 --> 18:20.257
You can't put cucumbers
on a pizza.

18:20.432 --> 18:21.990
Why not? I like cucumbers.

18:22.167 --> 18:24.601
That's not a pizza.
It will taste terrible.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.829
But that's the idea.
Make your own pie.

18:27.005 --> 18:29.974
Yes, but we cannot give the people
the right...

18:30.142 --> 18:32.133
...to choose any topping they want.

18:32.311 --> 18:34.836
Now, on this issue,
there can be no debate.

18:35.013 --> 18:37.345
What gives you the right
to tell me how I make my pie?

18:37.516 --> 18:38.813
Because it's a pizza.

18:38.984 --> 18:41.282
It's not a pizza
till it comes out of the oven.

18:41.453 --> 18:44.354
It's a pizza the moment
you put your fists in the dough.

18:44.523 --> 18:46.184
-No, it isn't!
-Yes, it is!

18:55.200 --> 18:56.929
-I'm home.
-Hey, honey.

18:57.102 --> 18:59.332
-Hi, Mom.
-Hi, baby.

18:59.505 --> 19:00.836
Hello.

19:03.775 --> 19:06.300
-<i>Breakfast at Tiffany's</i> ?
-Yeah.

19:06.478 --> 19:09.709
I just came back from Angela's.
It's not looking very good for Duncan.

19:09.882 --> 19:11.509
Oh, that's too bad.

19:11.683 --> 19:14.675
The doctor thinks it's just
a matter of time.

19:18.190 --> 19:20.920
Joe. Could you...?

19:21.093 --> 19:23.527
Poor guy. I hate to see him
suffer like this.

19:23.695 --> 19:25.925
-Yeah.
-You know, I'm sorry.

19:26.098 --> 19:27.656
I hate to be one of those people...

19:27.833 --> 19:30.324
...but we're right in the middle
of this thing.

19:30.502 --> 19:31.901
I can't hear.

19:32.371 --> 19:34.100
Who are you?

19:34.706 --> 19:36.503
This is George Costanza.

19:36.675 --> 19:39.508
It's just very hard to follow,
with all the talking.

19:41.113 --> 19:43.013
I'll pause it, okay?

19:45.651 --> 19:47.619
Any more grape juice?

19:51.023 --> 19:52.513
So who is this guy?

19:52.691 --> 19:55.626
-He's in some book club.
-And what's he doing here?

19:55.794 --> 19:57.762
Cheating on his test.

20:01.099 --> 20:04.091
So we watching the movie
or are we still talking?

20:05.504 --> 20:07.563
Okay, come on, let's go.

20:08.373 --> 20:10.034
What?

20:10.209 --> 20:11.437
Come on, you took my seat.

20:11.610 --> 20:13.134
It's not your seat.

20:14.046 --> 20:18.278
-I was sitting there. Come on.
-You didn't save it.

20:19.351 --> 20:21.478
I had the arm. Joe.

20:21.653 --> 20:22.950
What's the difference?

20:23.121 --> 20:25.612
I was very comfortable.
I've got my nuts here.

20:25.791 --> 20:27.315
It's my couch.

20:28.694 --> 20:30.628
All right, come on.
Come on, scootch over.

20:30.796 --> 20:34.596
-Wait, it's my seat!
-Stop being like a 2-year-old.

20:37.970 --> 20:39.995
Look! Look what you did!

20:40.172 --> 20:41.867
You got grape juice
all over our couch.

20:42.040 --> 20:44.702
You ruined our couch!

20:44.876 --> 20:46.571
Joe.

20:50.649 --> 20:54.016
-Oh, my God.
-You see?

20:54.987 --> 20:56.477
So are you gonna get a new couch?

20:56.655 --> 20:58.350
Well, I guess I have no choice.

20:58.690 --> 21:02.751
-What, do you want your old couch?
-I was hoping you'd offer.

21:04.296 --> 21:05.820
-Yeah?
-It's the movers.

21:05.998 --> 21:07.761
-Okay.
-Who's that?

21:07.933 --> 21:11.061
-Your boyfriend. He's taking it out.
-No, he's not my boyfriend.

21:11.236 --> 21:12.726
Why?

21:12.904 --> 21:14.132
Take a guess.

21:15.374 --> 21:17.342
Oh, really.

21:19.611 --> 21:20.976
-Hi.
-Hi.

21:21.146 --> 21:23.205
Hey, Carl, I also need you
to go to Elaine's...

21:23.382 --> 21:25.213
-...and bring my old couch back.
-Today?

21:25.384 --> 21:26.976
-Could you?
-Sure.

21:27.152 --> 21:28.949
Well, what are you doing
with this couch?

21:29.121 --> 21:30.782
George is taking it.

21:31.423 --> 21:34.187
Did you tell him it was peed on?

21:34.359 --> 21:37.260
He said he doesn't care.
He'll just turn the cushion over.

21:39.364 --> 21:42.629
-I'm sorry you feel that way, Elaine.
-Yeah, me too.

21:42.801 --> 21:45.668
-It's just too bad.
-Yeah, it is.

21:45.837 --> 21:49.398
Well, I better get this couch
back to Jerry's.

21:49.574 --> 21:53.066
-Can I offer you anything to drink?
-Yeah, sure.

21:54.079 --> 21:57.310
-All I've got is grape juice.
-Throw it.

21:58.750 --> 22:00.479
The couch!

22:11.229 --> 22:13.527
She didn't want the constraints
of any relationship.

22:13.699 --> 22:15.428
That's why she got rid of the cat.

22:15.600 --> 22:19.627
The most important thing in Holly's life
was her independence.

22:19.805 --> 22:21.864
Well, not really.

22:22.040 --> 22:24.338
After all, she did get together
with George Peppard.

22:28.246 --> 22:29.713
I mean, Fred.

22:30.415 --> 22:33.009
George, Fred's gay.
