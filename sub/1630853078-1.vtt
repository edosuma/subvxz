13:47.494 --> 13:48.745
Sorry.

13:49.913 --> 13:53.708
I think it's kind of ironic
that Hester named her Pearl.

13:53.792 --> 13:55.293
How so?

13:55.377 --> 13:57.671
Pearls are associated
with the color white,

13:57.754 --> 14:03.009
so we connect her with purity,
innocence and all.

14:03.093 --> 14:07.430
Pearl should be read as innocent
because of her association with white.

14:07.514 --> 14:08.723

Well, um, Professor Beckman...

14:16.481 --> 14:17.566
Liv.

the color white was connected with purity.

she was screaming

14:28.994 --> 14:30.912
So...

14:30.996 --> 14:35.875
obviously, some of her behavior
isn't supposed to be innocent.

14:35.959 --> 14:39.170

30:13.604 --> 30:15.356
(Gail sighs)

30:17.942 --> 30:21.195
So that's really serious, Jasmine.

30:21.278 --> 30:24.406
I've never failed before in my life.

30:24.490 --> 30:26.200
Yeah.

30:27.368 --> 30:29.787
Don't take grades personally.

30:29.870 --> 30:33.165
Trust me, it'll save you a lot of grief.

30:34.500 --> 30:37.336
It-it's not the grade, and it's not me.

30:38.671 --> 30:40.339
It's her.

30:41.340 --> 30:42.508
(lively chatter)

30:42.591 --> 30:44.134
I heard they tried
to poach him to Dartmouth,

30:44.218 --> 30:45.970
but then he'd have to move
to New Hampshire,

30:46.053 --> 30:47.763
and you know how he feels about snow.

30:47.846 --> 30:50.307
She's taking a sabbatical
to write a novel--

30:50.391 --> 30:51.433
a YA trilogy.

30:51.517 --> 30:52.851
It's completely shocking.

30:52.935 --> 30:54.728
-Heart attack...
-What?

30:54.812 --> 30:56.355
...in the middle of the lecture hall.

30:56.438 --> 30:58.399
-(laughter)
-You know, whatever, no judgment.

30:58.482 --> 31:01.026
I just, I didn't know that was his genre.

31:01.110 --> 31:03.445
(chatter continues)

31:03.529 --> 31:05.155
Honestly, I think she's

31:05.239 --> 31:07.449
the perfect tenure candidate
for right now.

31:07.533 --> 31:09.118
What's now?

31:09.201 --> 31:12.788
She's incredibly popular with students,
several of whom wrote testimonials...

31:12.871 --> 31:14.206
15 of them.

31:14.290 --> 31:16.625
And let's be honest.

31:16.709 --> 31:18.502
Liv Beckman is a woman of color

31:18.586 --> 31:21.714
in a faculty overwhelmingly not...

31:22.756 --> 31:24.216
...of color.

31:24.300 --> 31:26.927
LAM: That is the image
that Ancaster should have,

31:27.011 --> 31:28.887
-not boring...
-DIANDRA: Irrelevant.

31:28.971 --> 31:33.642
What we have to decide is,
on the basis of what is in here,

31:33.726 --> 31:36.604
does Professor Beckman
deserve to be tenured?

31:36.687 --> 31:38.856
It's a privilege.
It's not a right.

31:38.939 --> 31:40.357
You'd know something about privilege.

31:40.441 --> 31:43.527
Well, her published work is thin
to the point of nonexistence.

31:43.611 --> 31:45.112
GAIL:
Let's be fair.

31:45.195 --> 31:46.614
Liv has published.

31:46.697 --> 31:49.033
Maybe not a ton, but enough.

31:50.159 --> 31:54.413
Gail, do you really think
that you could be impartial?

31:55.456 --> 31:56.540
Why?

31:56.624 --> 31:57.875
Oh, she's your friend.

31:57.958 --> 31:59.460
JULIANNE:
Are you seriously trying

31:59.543 --> 32:00.919
to disenfranchise her right now?

32:01.003 --> 32:02.838
I am perfectly capable
of being professional.

32:02.921 --> 32:04.173
DIANDRA:
You're right.

32:04.256 --> 32:08.969
Actually, I'm surprised
that you don't agree.

32:09.053 --> 32:10.262
When you were tenured,

32:10.346 --> 32:13.182
you'd already had two books published
and how many articles?

32:13.265 --> 32:16.018
-Too many.
-Right. A ton.

32:17.061 --> 32:19.063
We have all been through the process,

32:19.146 --> 32:23.567
and we know how grueling it is,
but we earned it.

32:23.651 --> 32:28.197
We can look each other in the face
and know that we belong here.

32:29.365 --> 32:32.076
Imagine if that's brought into question.

32:36.538 --> 32:38.123
(sighs)

32:40.167 --> 32:42.294
I-I... you know, I-I do have...

32:42.378 --> 32:44.004
(sighs)

32:44.088 --> 32:45.673
...some doubts about Liv.

32:45.756 --> 32:50.636
A freshman in her seminar approached me
with a grade complaint,

32:50.719 --> 32:53.013
and she's filing a dispute
with the registrar.

32:53.097 --> 32:54.598
So...

32:54.682 --> 32:57.893
Grade grubbing is like an extracurricular
with these kids.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.144
GAIL:
Well, yeah, I know,

32:59.228 --> 33:00.938
but she thinks Liv is targeting her,

33:01.021 --> 33:04.650
so now OSL is doing
a performance review and...

33:04.733 --> 33:07.861
This... this is news to me.

33:07.945 --> 33:09.488
That definitely changes things.

33:09.571 --> 33:14.284
What I'm gonna suggest is
that we table this for today and reconvene

33:14.368 --> 33:17.037
when more of the details
come out in the wash.

33:17.121 --> 33:21.500
Now, African dance is in 15, so...
let's give 'em time to move the tables.

33:23.752 --> 33:25.421
Thanks for speaking up, Gail.

33:25.504 --> 33:28.799
