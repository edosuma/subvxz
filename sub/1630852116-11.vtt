WEBVTT

02:36.948 --> 02:41.536
Electro Boy became the youngest leader
of The Union of Justice ever!

02:42.370 --> 02:44.914
We finally have a superhero who can

02:44.998 --> 02:48.001
truly maintain peace in the USA forever!

02:49.252 --> 02:50.086
Carmine!

02:50.170 --> 02:51.171
What's wrong?

03:13.443 --> 03:14.611
How could he be so stupid?

03:15.361 --> 03:18.615
Getting caught pulling a scam
in The Salamander's own casino…

03:18.698 --> 03:19.949
How could he do that?

03:20.033 --> 03:22.660
A hundred million dollars in a month…

03:22.744 --> 03:24.162
There's no way it can be paid.

03:24.662 --> 03:27.206
He just wants villains everywhere
to get the message.

03:27.790 --> 03:30.585
But if it's not paid,
Carmine will be killed.

03:30.668 --> 03:34.047
That's right. So our only choice
is to get him out of the country.

03:35.173 --> 03:39.761
Actually, we could use
some intel I picked up at Supermax.

03:39.844 --> 03:40.845
Forget it.

03:40.929 --> 03:43.181
It's a way we could get 100 million!

03:43.264 --> 03:44.390
I don't want to hear it!

03:45.767 --> 03:48.102
I want you out of here
by the time I'm out of the shower.

03:48.603 --> 03:51.773
I'll arrange for Carmine's fake passport.

03:51.856 --> 03:53.650
Wait! Let's talk…

04:03.534 --> 04:07.121
Running away isn't your style,
is it, gramps?

04:11.125 --> 04:14.921
There will be parades
for days to celebrate him!

04:15.713 --> 04:20.426
"It's him! He's so cool!
Electro Boy! Look at me!"

04:25.974 --> 04:26.808
Not a chance.

04:26.891 --> 04:28.142
Count me out.

04:28.226 --> 04:29.852
How come?

04:29.936 --> 04:32.522
Because every job I've done
with you two has been a failure.

04:33.231 --> 04:36.859
And compared to five years ago,
there are even more superheroes.

04:36.943 --> 04:40.697
They call themselves heroes,
but they all just wanna be famous.

04:41.322 --> 04:45.243
Ghost! Johnny's the one
who came up with this plan, not me…

04:45.326 --> 04:46.327
Ouch…

04:47.578 --> 04:48.788
Take it easy, would you?

04:52.500 --> 04:54.544
I'm done with the villain racket.

04:54.627 --> 04:57.755
The architecture firm I started
has been doing well.

04:57.839 --> 05:00.216
I've got no reason
to go out and commit crimes.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.552
This is to help Carmine!

05:03.678 --> 05:06.639
I really am in big trouble.

05:08.683 --> 05:10.727
Then escape overseas.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.937
I'd be willing to pay for that.

05:13.438 --> 05:15.606
I owe you
that much for protecting me in prison.

05:21.863 --> 05:25.408
Electro Boy. The Utopian. The Flare.

05:25.992 --> 05:30.038
Their unwavering friendship
makes them invincible wherever they go!

05:37.837 --> 05:39.505
Hey! Where do you think you're going?

05:39.589 --> 05:42.258
There's still a whole truck
that needs to be unloaded!

05:42.341 --> 05:44.719
I thought Banks was supposed
to handle the rest.

05:45.303 --> 05:47.513
Banks took off 20 minutes ago.

05:51.809 --> 05:53.561
My wife's waiting for me at home.

05:53.644 --> 05:56.564
She's got the night shift,
so I gotta watch my little girl.

05:56.647 --> 05:59.650
Watch her all you want
after you unload that truck.

06:00.276 --> 06:03.029
I'll wake up the driver.
Don't go anywhere until you're done!

06:07.075 --> 06:08.242
Hey! Wake up!

06:08.326 --> 06:11.037
Hurry up and back this thing
into the loading dock!

06:11.120 --> 06:15.583
Hey! Goddammit! He's sleeping
with his headphones on again.

06:15.666 --> 06:16.626
Hey!

06:18.669 --> 06:19.587
What the…

06:21.047 --> 06:22.381
You fuckin' idiot!

06:22.465 --> 06:24.926
You know using superpowers is prohibited!

06:25.009 --> 06:27.887
My wife will get fired
if she's late for work!

06:27.970 --> 06:31.390
If this gets caught on video,
I'll get fired too!

06:31.474 --> 06:35.269
Put all these back and unload 'em
one by one by yourself! Understand?

06:36.521 --> 06:39.357
Sheesh!
We never shoulda hired an ex-villain.

06:40.066 --> 06:45.321
You awake now? Okay, don't move it yet!
And don't go to sleep either!

06:45.905 --> 06:47.573
Hey there, TK.

06:47.657 --> 06:50.493
Isn't it about time you found a new job?

06:51.536 --> 06:52.411
Johnny…

06:54.789 --> 06:56.624
If this is about a job, forget it.

07:03.965 --> 07:09.095
Nobody would pay ten bucks
for an umbrella on a sunny day like today.

07:09.178 --> 07:10.555
You think so?

07:24.861 --> 07:26.028
I'll take one!

07:26.112 --> 07:27.822
Sure thing! Thank you.

07:27.905 --> 07:29.740
-Me too!
-You got it.

07:29.824 --> 07:31.451
Where did this rain come from?

07:33.995 --> 07:35.746
That sure is odd.

07:36.747 --> 07:40.293
I thought the weather forecast
was for clear skies all day today.

07:44.422 --> 07:47.925
You're not here for an umbrella, are you?

07:52.597 --> 07:56.893
Johnny Bolt, aka Electro Boy,
doesn't take orders from anyone.

07:56.976 --> 07:59.604
Johnny Bolt only fights
alongside his friends

07:59.687 --> 08:01.856
and does things his own way.

08:15.286 --> 08:16.454
My dominant hand!

08:21.292 --> 08:24.795
Their work is as grotesque as ever.

08:24.879 --> 08:28.299
Is it their work
that's grotesque or just them?

08:31.177 --> 08:32.553
You okay?

08:32.637 --> 08:34.222
You better believe it!

08:34.305 --> 08:35.973
I can still brawl!

08:37.225 --> 08:38.184
Sammy!

08:49.153 --> 08:52.573
This is for hurtin' my brother,
you mother fucker!

08:52.657 --> 08:54.325
Beat the shit outta him, Roddy!

09:01.791 --> 09:06.796
For my plan to succeed,
we'll need both Roddy and Sammy.

09:06.879 --> 09:08.839
I hope they can join, but…

09:10.967 --> 09:13.511
Disposable ax kick!

09:35.658 --> 09:37.410
Are you Eleanor's girl?

09:39.912 --> 09:41.247
You a villain?

09:47.378 --> 09:49.213
Mom's been in the hospital for ages.

09:49.964 --> 09:50.881
Oh, I see.

09:51.465 --> 09:53.259
We don't get work for any plebes.

09:53.801 --> 09:55.595
We haven't for ages.

09:56.345 --> 09:57.471
Plebes?

09:58.514 --> 10:00.099
I'm Kasey-Anne.

10:00.182 --> 10:02.184
Didn't your mother tell you about me?

10:02.768 --> 10:05.896
You can't expect me to remember
the names of every rookie villain.

10:06.564 --> 10:07.732
Rookie?

10:09.775 --> 10:10.735
Whatever…

10:11.235 --> 10:12.820
I'm not here for work.

10:12.903 --> 10:16.741
I need a fake passport
and an airline ticket.

10:16.824 --> 10:17.742
For you?

10:17.825 --> 10:19.577
No, for my mentor.

10:19.660 --> 10:21.245
He got into some trouble.

10:21.829 --> 10:23.456
He's got to get out of the country.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.459
I can make you a passport.

10:27.126 --> 10:28.669
Bring him by tomorrow.

10:30.504 --> 10:33.549
You really haven't heard about me?

10:33.633 --> 10:34.467
What?

10:34.550 --> 10:37.887
You haven't heard of
the Phantom Witch, the West Coast Meteor,

10:37.970 --> 10:39.180
or the Eye-Dazzler Blonde?

10:40.389 --> 10:43.809
Holy… How lame.
Sounds like those old porn stars.

10:45.269 --> 10:48.189
But I couldn't stand
the life of a villain anymore,

10:48.272 --> 10:51.734
so I retired and live
a quiet life now, so I don't care.

10:51.817 --> 10:53.527
Really? Okay. See you tomorrow.

10:55.029 --> 10:57.239
But when I was active,
everyone knew my name.

10:57.323 --> 10:58.866
You retired, right?

10:58.949 --> 11:01.243
If you're happy being ordinary,
then be satisfied.

11:01.869 --> 11:03.704
Sorry, but I don't have the time

11:03.788 --> 11:06.165
to listen
to some obscure villain reminisce.

11:19.512 --> 11:23.307
Being a superhero
isn't an occupation but a lifestyle.

11:24.308 --> 11:26.310
It was Johnny Bolt's fate to live a life

11:26.394 --> 11:29.105
that would go down
in the annals of history.

11:33.192 --> 11:35.236
Mommy, what's for dinner tonight?

11:35.319 --> 11:36.362
We're having hamburgers.

11:36.445 --> 11:39.156
Yeah! I love hamburgers!

11:39.240 --> 11:41.992
But before that,
we're going to the park, right?

11:42.076 --> 11:43.494
Oh, that's right! Yeah!

11:43.577 --> 11:46.705
A lion cannot go through life
pretending to be a mouse.

11:47.373 --> 11:51.836
Extraordinary people need
extraordinary thrills to feel alive.

11:58.300 --> 12:01.470
"…need extraordinary thrills
to feel alive."

12:03.347 --> 12:05.182
That's totally what a villain is.

12:18.112 --> 12:22.658
This is where the legend
of Electro Boy begins.

12:44.305 --> 12:47.224
If this is some stupid plan,
I'll kick your ass.

13:03.407 --> 13:05.701
Make sure I look good in these photos.

13:05.784 --> 13:07.536
Don't screw around. Focus.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.454
What's this?

13:08.537 --> 13:10.498
Don't tell me you're jealous.

13:10.581 --> 13:12.750
If you've got time to prattle on,

13:12.833 --> 13:14.919
then hurry up
and tell us who the target is.

13:15.002 --> 13:17.338
No. Not yet, sweetheart.

13:17.922 --> 13:20.049
Only after we get this last team member.

13:20.132 --> 13:22.760
You make it sound as if it'll be so easy.

13:22.843 --> 13:23.886
He's here!

13:25.763 --> 13:27.806
I haven't been on a date in ages.

13:28.307 --> 13:29.767
Are you Glenda?

13:29.850 --> 13:31.060
Sorry to keep you waiting.

13:31.143 --> 13:34.647
Don't worry about it.
I just got here myself.

13:35.231 --> 13:39.109
I couldn't decide what to wear
and got changed three times.

13:39.193 --> 13:41.987
Doesn't that sound ridiculous
from a 40-year-old man?

13:42.655 --> 13:45.115
It's just that your photo was so charming.

13:46.700 --> 13:50.538
You know, you look a lot better
in a skintight suit.

13:53.457 --> 13:55.000
What do you mean by that?

13:55.584 --> 13:56.710
Sit down.

13:56.794 --> 13:58.295
I think you've got the wrong--

13:58.379 --> 14:01.674
I said sit down, Gladiator.

14:05.427 --> 14:06.679
Sheesh.

14:07.930 --> 14:11.809
I heard all kinds of rumors
when I was in Supermax.

14:12.518 --> 14:14.603
Like about the superhero
with a clean image

14:14.687 --> 14:18.274
who even came out of the closet
as gay and got married

14:18.857 --> 14:24.154
but who cheats on his husband
all the time using dating apps.

14:24.738 --> 14:29.743
You villain scum,
I'll make it so you never talk again.

14:31.579 --> 14:34.707
Now, now. My buddies have
this place surrounded.

14:34.790 --> 14:39.879
You don't want this photo you sent me
released to the world, do you?

14:40.462 --> 14:42.798
You're a superhero who catches crooks.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.467
It turns out you're not such
a straight arrow in private.

14:46.468 --> 14:49.513
That guy's lost his mind, man.

14:50.097 --> 14:53.267
What's more,
he was dating one hunk of a villain.

14:53.350 --> 14:55.686
The tabloids would eat it up.

14:57.021 --> 14:58.772
What do you want?

14:59.356 --> 15:02.192
If you help me with a robbery,

15:02.276 --> 15:04.111
I'll delete everything
and forget all about it.

15:04.194 --> 15:07.448
Why you scum-sucking…

15:07.531 --> 15:11.243
I think this job will actually be
something meaningful to you.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.163
How could working
with scumbags be meaningful?

15:14.246 --> 15:16.832
Don't talk like that
until you hear who the target is.

15:18.125 --> 15:21.670
Far, far across the sea,

15:22.546 --> 15:27.009
there is an American who opened a casino
on an island in the south of Japan.

15:27.676 --> 15:32.765
This fine target is stashing away
piles of money on this island

15:32.848 --> 15:36.977
where neither the Network
nor The Union of Justice can reach him.

15:57.915 --> 15:59.416
-The Bastard?
-The Bastard?

15:59.500 --> 16:01.794
The Bastard's in Japan?

16:01.877 --> 16:04.880
Praetorian too. You know him, right?

16:04.964 --> 16:07.257
Weren't you two close friends?

16:09.134 --> 16:12.096
Johnny, this is just way too nuts.

16:14.181 --> 16:17.184
How about it? Still not interested?

16:18.018 --> 16:19.103
Continue.

16:19.728 --> 16:23.023
Christopher Matts, aka The Bastard,

16:23.107 --> 16:25.734
the former top villain of the Network,

16:26.235 --> 16:27.987
has apparently retired

16:28.070 --> 16:31.448
and is living the easy life
painting pictures on that tropical island.

16:32.032 --> 16:37.204
Besides painting, Matts also opened
the Casino Grand Granite.

16:37.287 --> 16:38.163
Granite…

16:38.664 --> 16:43.335
Word is that this island is made of
one enormous block of solid granite.

16:44.044 --> 16:46.922
Matts liked that
and decided to move there.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.508
This is way too reckless. I'm out.

16:49.591 --> 16:50.467
Wait!

16:51.760 --> 16:52.678
This might…

16:53.345 --> 16:54.555
this just might work.

16:56.056 --> 17:01.103
Stealing from the top villain in a country
with zero superheroes or villains…

17:01.186 --> 17:04.565
Are you fucking kidding me?
I told you, I didn't do a goddamn thing!

17:04.648 --> 17:05.691
However--

17:05.774 --> 17:07.359
Keep your paws off of me!

17:09.445 --> 17:11.572
The only things in our way
are two supervillains.

17:12.614 --> 17:15.242
You got a problem, you old geezer?

17:17.286 --> 17:20.122
If we can just sneak in, this could work.

17:21.248 --> 17:22.166
Praetorian.

17:23.208 --> 17:24.418
Out of the way!

17:26.378 --> 17:27.296
Haven't seen this in a while.

17:31.091 --> 17:33.552
-What are you doing?
-Hey! Let me go!

17:34.136 --> 17:35.512
What? Wait a sec--

17:44.313 --> 17:48.150
That Praetorian sullied
the superhero image.

17:48.233 --> 17:50.527
This is a rare chance
to teach him a lesson.

17:51.195 --> 17:56.283
We'll donate your share of the haul
to the LGBTQ charity of your choice.

17:57.451 --> 17:59.578
How about it? Good deal?

18:01.205 --> 18:03.040
You'll delete all the images, right?

18:03.123 --> 18:04.583
Of course.

18:05.375 --> 18:07.669
The final member has joined the crew.

18:23.185 --> 18:25.104
How was it?

18:25.187 --> 18:28.232
I came to a great realization.

18:28.732 --> 18:30.567
That is magnificent.

18:30.651 --> 18:35.322
Death is only a means, not an end.

18:37.407 --> 18:42.454
Why is it
that we are able to sense beauty?

18:43.205 --> 18:45.165
"Beauty," you say?

18:46.166 --> 18:50.587
High Priest, you are my teacher
who guides me in my meditation.

18:50.671 --> 18:56.635
However, when I step outside this place,
I could kill you

18:57.136 --> 18:59.596
without even lifting a finger.

19:00.097 --> 19:02.141
Try thinking about that.

19:02.224 --> 19:04.685
It will change your view of the world.

19:06.228 --> 19:08.272
But don't you worry.

19:08.355 --> 19:11.108
I've decided to never use
my superpower again.

19:11.859 --> 19:16.530
However, when I decide
to take someone's life,

19:17.072 --> 19:21.451
the most important thing is
to cause fear in them.

19:30.127 --> 19:34.590
When we experience fear,
that is when beauty first arises.

19:36.258 --> 19:38.927
I should be able to paint
something quite nice tonight.

20:01.074 --> 20:03.160
There's only one airport on the island.

20:03.744 --> 20:05.954
Matts has boosted security there.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.789
Let's use Kasey there like before.

20:07.873 --> 20:10.125
No. It's way too risky.

20:11.168 --> 20:12.336
There'll be nine of us,

20:12.419 --> 20:14.838
I've never been there
and I can't prep ahead of time.

20:15.422 --> 20:17.090
I could never hide all of us.

20:17.758 --> 20:19.259
How many could you hide?

20:19.885 --> 20:21.261
Maybe one or two.

20:25.557 --> 20:27.351
What are you doing? Hurry up!

20:27.434 --> 20:29.269
Hey! Wait up!

20:37.069 --> 20:40.030
Make sure you have all your belongings.

20:40.113 --> 20:41.365
Watch your step.

20:41.448 --> 20:42.282
Bye.

20:42.366 --> 20:43.367
See you later.

20:55.629 --> 20:56.838
Are we there?

20:57.506 --> 20:59.091
What about us?

20:59.758 --> 21:02.135
The rest will come
by ferry from Kagoshima.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.264
There must be security at the port.

21:05.347 --> 21:07.432
You won't use the port.

21:14.439 --> 21:18.068
I never thought
I'd jump off a ferry at my age.

21:18.735 --> 21:20.487
You can end all this, Forecast.

21:20.570 --> 21:21.488
Sure thing.

21:27.452 --> 21:28.662
Where's Gladiator?

21:29.288 --> 21:30.330
He hates boats.

21:30.414 --> 21:32.040
He'll be here soon.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.834
What? How will he get here?

21:39.548 --> 21:40.674
Aw, jeez…

21:43.302 --> 21:44.136
Whoa!

21:57.566 --> 21:59.234
He's lost his marbles.

22:03.655 --> 22:05.407
Ninety minutes?

22:06.199 --> 22:07.617
I can still shave time off that.

22:09.953 --> 22:11.288
Where's the hot spring?

22:26.094 --> 22:29.431
Kasey, why the costume?

22:29.514 --> 22:31.308
No way I'm letting you see me naked.

22:31.808 --> 22:35.145
I'm the only one
who can see my sweetheart naked.

22:35.228 --> 22:36.897
Don't act like my boyfriend.

22:36.980 --> 22:38.982
It's just a pain to do it for you too.

22:42.235 --> 22:43.111
What?

22:43.195 --> 22:46.823
That one time, it wasn't like
we had a grudge against you.

22:46.907 --> 22:48.700
Yeah. It's just that McCabe was--

22:48.784 --> 22:49.868
Don't talk to me!

22:49.951 --> 22:53.205
The only reason I'm here
is to beat the crap out of Praetorian.

22:53.288 --> 22:54.456
Okay…

22:57.292 --> 22:59.586
Josh, you're quieter than usual.

22:59.669 --> 23:05.092
Any proper villain wouldn't even think
of trying to steal from The Bastard.

23:05.175 --> 23:07.385
I've got the perfect plan.

23:07.469 --> 23:09.387
Don't you worry about it, Ghost.

23:10.055 --> 23:12.766
Then it's about time
you told us that plan, Johnny.

23:12.849 --> 23:13.809
Yeah.

23:23.568 --> 23:27.364
First, we'll enter Matts's estate
right through the front door.

23:40.168 --> 23:42.170
I look pretty good in a suit.

25:23.396 --> 25:28.443
