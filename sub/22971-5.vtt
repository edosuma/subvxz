00:49.883 --> 00:54.596
A battle to break your will!

00:56.014 --> 01:02.520
If the Impure cannot break your armor,
her death surely will.

01:02.604 --> 01:05.355
You shall be mine!

01:06.524 --> 01:08.568
We don't have to fight, Nomura.

01:08.651 --> 01:10.779
You don't. I do.

01:10.862 --> 01:15.450
Sorry. I really was getting to like you.

01:19.788 --> 01:23.833
Fight me, young Gynt!
Or else Gunmar will do us both in.

01:26.127 --> 01:28.671
My friends are here.
We're going home.

01:28.755 --> 01:31.549
Home? Home is gone!

01:44.062 --> 01:48.108
They're in the dungeon. I saw them.
We just have to get back there.

01:48.191 --> 01:51.194
Only one of us is leaving this arena.

01:57.742 --> 01:58.952
Oh, no.

01:59.035 --> 02:02.288
His will, it's weakening.

02:02.372 --> 02:04.749
- We're committing to this.
- Yeah, I'm committed.

02:04.833 --> 02:05.917
Mm, come on!

02:06.000 --> 02:09.044
- Toby, don't hold back.
- I'm not. On three...

02:09.128 --> 02:12.674
- One, two, three!
- One, two, three!

02:14.676 --> 02:18.513
- I really thought we had it this time.
- I don't think this door's gonna open.

02:20.140 --> 02:24.644
Kanjigar said we needed Chompsky to be
our guide and more. You don't think...

02:27.355 --> 02:31.317
You'll forgive me if this works.

02:38.283 --> 02:41.286
- How would Kanjigar know that?
- Who cares! Let's get Jim.

02:41.369 --> 02:43.872
Chompsky, go find Blinky
and Aaarrrgghh!!!

02:43.955 --> 02:46.541
Ha! Such a spunky little fella.

02:51.921 --> 02:55.758
Dictatious, I thought you were dead.
I mourned you.

02:55.842 --> 02:58.511
Sentimental sap.

02:58.595 --> 03:02.599
Despite a plenitude of eyes,
you remain blind to the truth.

03:02.682 --> 03:05.727
Gunmar is Trollkind's salvation.

03:05.810 --> 03:07.854
No. This isn't you, brother.

03:07.937 --> 03:10.064
This is the cursed blade
of Gunmar talking.

03:10.148 --> 03:14.027
This is not the blade's work.
I chose to follow Gunmar.

03:14.110 --> 03:18.448
I idolized you.
Your books fill my library.

03:18.531 --> 03:20.575
And your words waste my time.

03:20.658 --> 03:23.369
Gunmar's restoration of Earth
is finally upon us.

03:23.453 --> 03:28.082
Once you disclose the location
of the Killahead Bridge.

03:28.166 --> 03:30.460
Help you free Gunmar? Ha!

03:30.543 --> 03:34.672
You could torture me a thousand years
on hot pokers, and I'd never tell.

03:36.007 --> 03:37.884
I'll never tell you!

03:37.967 --> 03:41.387
Hmm. Oh, really, brother?

03:41.471 --> 03:43.431
Oh, no!

03:43.514 --> 03:46.434
I didn't think you'd bring pillows
to this fight.

03:48.102 --> 03:51.481
I thought I ordered meat sauce,
not weak sauce.

03:51.564 --> 03:54.067
How about now?

03:54.150 --> 03:56.653
If I wanted to be tucked in,

03:56.736 --> 03:59.030
I would've called Mother.

04:00.573 --> 04:03.701
You always had a weak stomach,
didn't you?

04:03.785 --> 04:06.120
Oh, no! No!

04:06.204 --> 04:10.541
- Where did you move the Bridge?
- Your bark is worse than your bite.

04:10.625 --> 04:12.502
Tell me! Where is it?

04:12.585 --> 04:16.630
Don't you know it's not my nature
to break?

04:16.714 --> 04:19.132
I once admired you.

04:19.216 --> 04:23.763
But now I see, you are the rotten apple
in the family tree.

04:23.846 --> 04:26.516
I'll never tell you!

04:26.599 --> 04:29.394
Oh, but you already have.

04:29.477 --> 04:35.108
It's obvious you would require privacy,
yet space, to rebuild the Bridge,

04:35.191 --> 04:38.861
but it's your choice of wordplay
that gives it away.

04:38.945 --> 04:42.156
Bark, tree, nature.

04:42.240 --> 04:43.741
Oh, no.

04:43.825 --> 04:49.122
Killahead Bridge is in a forest
somewhere near Arcadia.

04:49.205 --> 04:50.999
You evil mastermind!

04:51.082 --> 04:53.042
Soon it will be ours.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.878
Find out where it corresponds
in the Darklands

04:55.962 --> 04:58.881
and inform Gunmar at once.

04:58.965 --> 05:01.301
My flare! If
only I could reach...

05:01.384 --> 05:07.181
Sticks and stones may break your bones
but a Parlok spear can do far worse.

05:07.265 --> 05:10.727
Adieu, brother.

05:13.396 --> 05:16.649
My eyes, my six eyes!

05:17.150 --> 05:22.822
Oh, great destiny! Kanjigar was correct.
Our success could still be fated!

05:22.905 --> 05:26.284
You brat!
You useless little fleabag of a...

05:26.367 --> 05:30.371
Goodbye, Dictatious.

05:32.540 --> 05:33.708
Thank you.

05:37.754 --> 05:39.422
Where are others?

05:39.505 --> 05:42.216
I fear that is the message
he is struggling to convey.

05:42.300 --> 05:45.386
Lead the way, our pint-sized friend.

05:50.433 --> 05:54.604
You're holding back.
Kill the changeling!

05:54.687 --> 05:58.357
This will not end until
you take her life.

06:27.720 --> 06:30.932
Will you listen to me?
There's a way out.

06:31.015 --> 06:33.476
Claire and Toby are here to save us.

06:33.559 --> 06:37.563
You cry for your friends,
but there is no rescue.

06:41.901 --> 06:44.612
There is no home!

06:50.159 --> 06:52.662
We've been here before.
We're running in circles.

06:53.663 --> 06:57.708
I can hear him. He's got to be
on the other side of this skull!

06:57.792 --> 07:01.129
I used to love mazes. Not anymore.

07:01.212 --> 07:02.797
- What did you do?
- That wasn't me.

07:09.887 --> 07:13.224
No one dies today. We're going home.

07:16.644 --> 07:19.021
There's gotta be another way.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.274
Uh...

07:25.987 --> 07:27.238
Come on, come on!

07:27.321 --> 07:29.949
- Yes.
- Come on! Come on!

07:31.075 --> 07:34.495
Your will betrays you
and so does your armor!

07:34.579 --> 07:36.164
Enough, Nomura.

07:36.247 --> 07:38.166
You've proven your loyalty.

07:38.249 --> 07:42.462
Now, leave the final blow to me.

07:42.545 --> 07:45.590
Merlin's Trollhunter is mine.

07:48.176 --> 07:51.137
Your friends. You're not crazy.

07:51.220 --> 07:52.597
Oh, everything hurts.

07:52.680 --> 07:54.849
- Jim!
- Jim!

07:54.932 --> 07:58.519
- Not just Jim!
- Humans? Here?

07:58.603 --> 08:00.938
The Bridge is open!

08:01.022 --> 08:02.690
Catch them!

08:02.773 --> 08:03.691
This way.

08:05.067 --> 08:07.028
It's locked!

08:07.111 --> 08:11.824
- You have to get us to the Bridge.
- Let him follow us? We're not that crazy!

08:13.409 --> 08:15.203
Leave that to me.

08:29.342 --> 08:30.843
There's a keyhole!

08:32.010 --> 08:37.058
- Holy sheeshkebab. The key! It's a crank!
- Don't just stare at it! Use it!

08:47.568 --> 08:49.737
- Hurry!
- What do you think I'm doing?

08:56.786 --> 08:58.079
Yes!

08:58.162 --> 09:00.873
Come on, come on. Let's go, Jim.

09:02.291 --> 09:06.170
Release my army!

09:06.254 --> 09:08.839
- What is Nomura doing here?
- She's with us.

09:08.923 --> 09:12.260
You're supposed to be alone.
Kanjigar said you had to be alone!

09:12.343 --> 09:14.262
Wait, what?

09:14.345 --> 09:16.013
This way!

09:22.186 --> 09:25.523
Hurry, friends.
Your time is slipping away.

09:34.156 --> 09:38.578
- The savage brutality. This is...
- Hmm. Gunmar.

09:38.661 --> 09:42.707
That's more than Gunmar.

09:46.752 --> 09:48.004
No, this way.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.889
Wasn't expecting to find her here.

09:58.973 --> 10:02.435
I know, right? And we're supposed
to rescue Jim. Only Jim.

10:02.518 --> 10:04.520
I don’t know!
You wanna be the one to tell her that?

10:09.984 --> 10:12.695
- We can look for another way around!
- No time.

10:18.576 --> 10:20.411
Youth before beauty.

10:21.829 --> 10:24.332
You ready?

10:28.502 --> 10:29.795
Oh, no.

10:31.213 --> 10:32.506
Hey, watch your hands!

10:32.590 --> 10:35.468
Oh, I really pictured that
going more smoothly.

10:39.930 --> 10:43.476
- Thank you, Ms. Nomura
- I never liked you.

10:43.559 --> 10:46.937
Might be a little tight. But that's fine.

10:47.021 --> 10:51.067
- Ooh. Ay.
- Anything else I can get you?

10:51.150 --> 10:53.694
No, no, no, no, no!

10:55.988 --> 11:00.368
- Pump your legs, like you're on a swing!
- No! Whoa!

11:07.667 --> 11:11.837
- Thanks, Ms. Nomura. Uh?
- I still don't like you.

11:12.421 --> 11:13.964
Master Jim?

11:14.048 --> 11:15.257
Master Jim?

11:20.179 --> 11:22.556
Perhaps we should rendezvous
at the Bridge.

11:27.353 --> 11:29.230
Find friends first.

11:30.356 --> 11:33.192
Come, Aaarrrgghh!!!
Time is running out.

11:33.275 --> 11:36.695
Did you hear that?

11:39.031 --> 11:42.118
I'm hearing a lot of things,
and I'm not liking any of it.

11:42.201 --> 11:46.122
Goblins? I hate Goblins.

11:50.918 --> 11:53.045
- There's too many!
- Run!

12:03.055 --> 12:04.056
Come on!

12:08.644 --> 12:12.022
Not that way!
It's like a goblin rainbow of death!

12:17.361 --> 12:18.362
A dead end!

12:21.532 --> 12:24.201
- They were herding us!
- Herding? To what?

12:24.285 --> 12:26.745
Not what, who.

12:29.707 --> 12:34.420
The Bridge.
You will take me there.

12:34.503 --> 12:38.591
Stay away from the sword.
He'll put you under his control!

12:38.674 --> 12:41.510
Don't worry. I have a general
rule to stay away from sharp things.

12:41.594 --> 12:47.141
Stop toying with the children
and fight one of your own kind.

12:47.224 --> 12:51.562
You are not my kind, Impure.

12:58.194 --> 13:00.154
Go!

13:11.916 --> 13:17.630
You do not deserve my blade.

13:25.095 --> 13:27.890
Toby, help me.
We can't leave her like this.

13:27.973 --> 13:29.475
Or can we?

13:29.558 --> 13:30.643
Fine, fine.

13:34.104 --> 13:37.316
I have waited centuries.

13:37.399 --> 13:39.235
Tell me...

13:39.318 --> 13:42.947
where is the Bridge?

13:43.030 --> 13:45.074
No!

13:46.951 --> 13:47.952
No!

13:50.120 --> 13:52.414
No!

13:53.541 --> 13:56.877
Your armor's
not going to protect you for long!

14:01.382 --> 14:03.968
- I-I think your leg’s broken.
- You think?

14:09.974 --> 14:10.808
Gunmar.

14:12.935 --> 14:14.103
And Master Jim.

14:16.146 --> 14:19.400
Ah, blast this infernal labyrinth!
Where are they?

14:24.154 --> 14:30.286
If you do not tell me,
I will turn you all!

14:30.369 --> 14:32.121
You must tell me!

14:36.125 --> 14:38.043
No!

14:38.127 --> 14:39.837
Jim, hold on!

14:45.759 --> 14:47.761
No!

14:50.764 --> 14:51.891
There they are!

14:53.350 --> 14:55.352
- No!
- How do we get down?

14:55.436 --> 14:58.272
Very well. Uh, nope.

14:58.355 --> 15:00.566
Now you're mine!

15:04.403 --> 15:06.071
You!

15:06.155 --> 15:07.197
Traitor!

15:12.536 --> 15:15.289
Master Jim! Master Jim, you're alive!

15:25.174 --> 15:26.175
Aaarrrgghh!!!

15:26.258 --> 15:32.014
You have gone soft.
Let my blade remake you.

15:35.601 --> 15:42.232
- Never. You've grown old. Weaker.
- Strong enough to kill you still.

15:42.316 --> 15:45.194
- Would you rather die?
- Done that.

15:51.825 --> 15:55.037
Ah-ha! Excelsior! But no time
to celebrate. Let's make haste.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.967
Dark Underlord,
I know where the Bridge is.

16:08.050 --> 16:10.094
We need to gather the armies.

16:10.177 --> 16:12.554
Forget the army. We go now!

16:13.847 --> 16:16.809
Come on! Where are you fools?

16:40.249 --> 16:43.377
Almost there, guys! Gotta keep moving.
Time's running out!

16:47.089 --> 16:49.258
No!

16:49.341 --> 16:51.760
No!

16:56.557 --> 16:59.601
There's no time for this, Jimbo.
We got to keep moving.

16:59.685 --> 17:01.145
We're not leaving her.

17:02.438 --> 17:04.606
Listen to them, little Gynt.

17:05.190 --> 17:07.568
I'm only slowing you down.

17:07.651 --> 17:10.487
But I... But I told you
we were both getting out of here.

17:10.570 --> 17:16.285
It was a nice thought. I'll hold off
as many of them as I can. Go!

17:16.367 --> 17:19.163
- No! Ah!
- Jim!

17:23.375 --> 17:24.376
No!

17:32.092 --> 17:33.844
Okay, boys.

17:34.428 --> 17:36.138
Let's dance.

17:36.221 --> 17:38.348
Let me go! No!

17:41.310 --> 17:43.312
Oh, dear. Master Jim!

17:44.897 --> 17:46.148
Uh.

17:56.533 --> 17:59.703
- What are you doing here?
- My father said I had a choice.

17:59.787 --> 18:03.040
This is my choice. Get in!

18:03.123 --> 18:05.459
- Shotgun!
- Let's get this thing moving!

18:06.251 --> 18:08.587
Make room for one more.
She's coming with us.

18:08.670 --> 18:09.963
Nomura.

18:12.382 --> 18:13.217
Nomura!

18:29.525 --> 18:32.277
- The Bridge! It's closing!
- Go, go!

18:36.615 --> 18:39.076
A Nyarlagroth!

18:41.161 --> 18:44.373
- Don't stop!
- This will do some damage!

18:54.174 --> 18:55.425
Faster! It's closing!

19:14.194 --> 19:15.237
Whew!

19:20.409 --> 19:21.410
Hi.

19:22.828 --> 19:25.330
I know one thing for certain.

19:25.414 --> 19:29.543
I hope to never see the likes
of that Bridge ever again.

19:33.964 --> 19:36.550
- Awesome sauce!
- Master Jim!

19:36.633 --> 19:41.763
- Jim! You're home!
- It's so, so good to see you guys!

19:46.143 --> 19:47.144
You want in?

19:48.478 --> 19:50.480
That's not my thing.

19:50.564 --> 19:52.608
Thank you, little Gynt.

19:52.691 --> 19:56.069
I have to hand it to
you, you were right.

19:56.153 --> 20:00.407
- About what?
- Hope. Friends.

20:01.074 --> 20:01.909
Hmm.

20:01.992 --> 20:05.120
I believe this belongs
to you, Master Jim.

20:16.632 --> 20:20.010
Feels good to have this back.

20:36.360 --> 20:39.738
I missed you.

20:47.496 --> 20:50.290
- Whoa.
- Mm-mm. Private.

20:52.334 --> 20:56.380
- Ugh! A savage custom.
- Absolutely.

20:57.214 --> 20:59.091
I missed you too.

20:59.174 --> 21:01.927
You've also missed a few showers.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.097
Let's get rid of this Bridge
once and for all.

21:05.180 --> 21:09.226
Ha! Just wait until Trollmarket
gets a load of Jim and Aaarrrgghh!!!

21:09.309 --> 21:11.228
Oh, no! The Tribunal!

21:11.311 --> 21:14.523
They're gonna go crazy town banana pants
when they find out what we've been up to!

21:14.606 --> 21:16.191
Frankly, who cares?

21:16.275 --> 21:19.111
We have our Trollhunter back.

21:35.669 --> 21:38.171
Excuse me, where have you been?

21:38.964 --> 21:43.010
You can't just vanish for a whole day
without calling! I've been worried sick...

21:43.093 --> 21:44.386
Oh! Oh...

21:46.930 --> 21:47.764
Oh.

21:48.348 --> 21:50.517
I-I guess it was only a day.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.813
It's just good to be home, Mom.

21:54.819 --> 21:56.819
