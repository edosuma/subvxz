12:21.208 --> 12:23.000
Just like that?

12:23.000 --> 12:26.083
Well, I'm sorry
you find us so boring.

12:26.083 --> 12:27.875
That's one hell of a truck
you got there.

12:27.875 --> 12:30.834
22-inch rims,
Alpine subs, Kicker amp.

12:30.834 --> 12:32.542
My boy Rico hooked us up.

12:32.542 --> 12:34.208
I'm glad
you're treating yourself.

12:34.208 --> 12:35.667
That's what money's for, son.

12:35.667 --> 12:37.792
I'm gonna fire up the grill,

12:37.792 --> 12:39.709
and I hope you're ready
for some manual labor

12:39.709 --> 12:42.750
'cause as you can see,
I'm hardly packed.

12:49.709 --> 12:52.041
I can barely handle my life
in this house with Ray

12:52.041 --> 12:57.000
lying to me all the time,
never mind fucking Bridget.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.166
Ray's still lying to you?

12:59.166 --> 13:00.333
Yeah.

13:00.333 --> 13:03.709
You see that woman
come by here last night?

13:03.709 --> 13:07.417
He expects me to believe
he's not fucking her.

13:07.417 --> 13:10.208
It's like Fatal Attraction.

13:10.208 --> 13:13.250
I bet she wasn't wearing
any panties.

13:13.250 --> 13:16.250
[laughs]

13:16.250 --> 13:18.041
That was Basic Instinct.

13:18.041 --> 13:20.917
[both laugh]

13:23.500 --> 13:27.125
Ray's just like my old man was
with my mom...

13:27.125 --> 13:28.917
too caught up
in his own bullshit

13:28.917 --> 13:31.291
to realize
how beautiful she was.

13:51.291 --> 13:54.250
That didn't happen.

13:54.250 --> 13:56.166
Right.

14:04.333 --> 14:09.458

14:20.375 --> 14:22.625
I spent most
of that day, uh...

14:22.625 --> 14:25.291
at the Fish and Wildlife Center
with Commissioner Miller.

14:25.291 --> 14:27.083
You see Varick Strauss
at all?

14:27.083 --> 14:28.750
No.

14:28.750 --> 14:31.125
Hear anything about
where he might have gone?

14:31.125 --> 14:33.667
No.

14:33.667 --> 14:35.333
Did he ever say anything
to you

14:35.333 --> 14:38.000
about wanting
to visit Central America?

14:38.000 --> 14:39.667
We didn't have
that kind of relationship.

14:39.667 --> 14:41.166
I see.

14:41.166 --> 14:43.834
At the end of the day
you went straight home, right?

14:43.834 --> 14:46.667
Yeah.

14:46.667 --> 14:47.750
Then what?

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
Fell asleep on the couch
watching TV.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.834
What's your relationship like
with his wife...

15:02.834 --> 15:04.375
- Paige Finney?
- Professional.

15:04.375 --> 15:08.750
Ever threaten a member
of the Finney family?

15:08.750 --> 15:10.000
No.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.834
Look, my lawyer
is on his way over here.

15:12.834 --> 15:14.083
I think I should probably
wait for him

15:14.083 --> 15:16.041
before I answer
any more of your questions.

15:16.041 --> 15:20.291
I got a statement here
from the old lady, Charlotte.

15:20.291 --> 15:23.417
Says you forced her
to perform an act of fellatio

15:23.417 --> 15:25.917
on you at gunpoint.

15:32.166 --> 15:36.041
[laughs]
I'm just fucking with you.

15:36.041 --> 15:39.583
No, you didn't go straight home
that day.

15:39.583 --> 15:42.875
You were right here...

15:42.875 --> 15:45.291
in the mountains
outside Santa Clarita.

15:48.333 --> 15:52.333
Now, what were you doing there?

15:52.333 --> 15:56.083
- [door opens]
- That's it. Show's over.

15:56.083 --> 15:58.458
Mr. Donovan is finished
with you now.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.417
Ray, let's go.

16:06.709 --> 16:08.583
Andrew Finney was in
three hours ago

16:08.583 --> 16:11.542
telling the Chief of Police
you killed the guy.

16:11.542 --> 16:13.625
Ray, don't.

16:17.417 --> 16:20.208
You tell Finney he's got
one chance to stop this.

16:20.208 --> 16:21.417
If you give yourself up,

16:21.417 --> 16:23.375
I promise
they'll go easy on you.

16:23.375 --> 16:24.750
Fuck you.

16:24.750 --> 16:28.208
Tell him to walk it back.

16:28.208 --> 16:31.083
Okay, I would have handled
that a little differently.

16:31.083 --> 16:32.875
Well, has he been arrested?

16:32.875 --> 16:34.792
They're processing
the evidence, but I do know

16:34.792 --> 16:37.166
they're gonna want to talk
to you before they charge him.

16:37.166 --> 16:40.291
Well, what about the business?
How much trouble are we in?

16:40.291 --> 16:43.417
Oh, nothing
that can't be fixed.

16:43.417 --> 16:47.375
There's a mountain of favors
owed me in this town,

16:47.375 --> 16:52.125
and if we do lose the team,
since you are now in charge,

16:52.125 --> 16:55.542
I'll let you decide
where to reinvest the money.

16:55.542 --> 16:57.083
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:57.083 --> 16:58.917
But, Paige, I do need you
to go to the police

16:58.917 --> 17:00.875
and back up my story
as soon as possible.

17:00.875 --> 17:02.625
I mean, Windsor
will set it up for you.

17:02.625 --> 17:05.166
- I don't know anything.
- You knew what he was after.

17:09.458 --> 17:11.000
You're the one who hired him.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.875
And you're the one
that slept with him.

17:13.875 --> 17:16.291
You were training him
to take Varick's place.

17:16.291 --> 17:18.959
You were building him up
into something that he wasn't.

17:18.959 --> 17:21.375
Your fucking monster,
not mine.

17:25.208 --> 17:28.667
[cell phone rings]

17:28.667 --> 17:30.291
- Yeah?
- You're not gonna like this.

17:30.291 --> 17:32.000
What?

17:32.000 --> 17:34.417
Poker's gone.

17:34.417 --> 17:36.250
- Cochran.
- Yeah, it's Cochran.

17:36.250 --> 17:38.333
He probably gave it
to the cops.

17:38.333 --> 17:40.333
No, they would have held me
if he did.

17:40.333 --> 17:41.667
I'll call you back.

17:41.667 --> 17:43.375
You're gonna need
a criminal lawyer...

17:43.375 --> 17:44.667
today.

17:59.834 --> 18:02.208
[scoffs]
Of course.

18:09.792 --> 18:11.542
[Abby] You sure you don't want
me to stay?

18:11.542 --> 18:14.250
Yeah, I'm good.

18:14.250 --> 18:17.542
All right, well, get Bunch
to drop you off, yeah?

18:17.542 --> 18:20.041
Okay.

18:20.041 --> 18:22.500
Abby, come on in,
have a hot dog.

18:22.500 --> 18:24.125
Hey.

18:24.125 --> 18:25.208
Today's not the day.

18:25.208 --> 18:27.000
Come on,
I'm moving to Reno.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.917
You can't spare 45 minutes,
say good-bye?

18:28.917 --> 18:30.417
I'm sorry.

18:30.417 --> 18:32.917
I'm just not in the mood
for a party.

18:32.917 --> 18:34.250
I get it.

18:34.250 --> 18:36.083
It's an hour's flight
from Burbank,

18:36.083 --> 18:40.166
for fuck sakes, Mick.

18:40.166 --> 18:42.166
Bye.

18:42.166 --> 18:44.250
Bye.

18:56.083 --> 18:58.250

Wow.

18:58.250 --> 18:59.542
Hi.

18:59.542 --> 19:01.250
What are you
doing here?

19:01.250 --> 19:02.583
Do I know you?

19:02.583 --> 19:04.083
Yeah, Conor.

19:04.083 --> 19:05.583
We hooked up at that party,
remember?

19:05.583 --> 19:07.291
Maybe we could go
to the movies sometime.

19:07.291 --> 19:09.959
Sure.
200 bucks.

19:09.959 --> 19:11.458
I mean,
I could buy your ticket,

19:11.458 --> 19:13.000
but I don't think
it's gonna be 200.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.083
No, the 200 is for me.

19:15.083 --> 19:17.709
That's the price.

19:17.709 --> 19:19.417
Conor.

19:19.417 --> 19:22.750
Why don't you go upstairs,
help Bunchy with the boxes?

19:22.750 --> 19:24.291
All right.

19:26.875 --> 19:30.375

20:22.166 --> 20:24.417
What, you're gonna shoot me now?
Huh?

20:24.417 --> 20:27.000
Fuck yourself,
you Irish piece of shit.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.125
Aah!
God damn!

20:30.125 --> 20:31.834
Where is the poker?

20:33.667 --> 20:34.667
Fuck!

20:36.333 --> 20:39.417
Come on, give it to me.

20:39.417 --> 20:42.834
You better be careful.

20:48.583 --> 20:51.834
[Bunchy]
Come on, Con. Let's go.

20:51.834 --> 20:53.667
Hey, Bunch,
have you seen Michelle?

20:53.667 --> 20:55.959
- Nah, I ain't seen her.
- Okay, you see that bitch,

20:55.959 --> 20:57.250
- come get me.
- What happened?

20:57.250 --> 20:59.125
A $600 Uber bill's
what happened.

20:59.125 --> 21:01.291
Daryll, where's my Caddy?

21:04.083 --> 21:07.291
Daryll?
Hey.

21:07.291 --> 21:08.667
Why's my shit in boxes?

21:08.667 --> 21:10.875
- We're moving to Reno, kiddo.
- Reno?

21:10.875 --> 21:12.875
Yeah, biggest little city
in the world.

21:12.875 --> 21:16.250
See, in Reno, we'll be
a big fish in a small pond.

21:16.250 --> 21:19.709
Between our LA girls and
my East Coast sophistication,

21:19.709 --> 21:21.166
they won't know
what hit 'em.

21:21.166 --> 21:23.291
In fact, LA Girls
ain't a bad name.

21:23.291 --> 21:25.875
Oh, this guy.

21:25.875 --> 21:28.208
I'm sorry to tell you, Pop,
but I'm not going to Reno.

21:28.208 --> 21:29.625
Sure you are.
We're partners.

21:29.625 --> 21:31.166
Get off me.

21:31.166 --> 21:32.667
I've been a fucking idiot.

21:32.667 --> 21:34.750
I spent my whole life
waiting for you

21:34.750 --> 21:36.333
to get out of prison
and be my father.

21:36.333 --> 21:38.458
Done everything
you asked me to do, everything,

21:38.458 --> 21:40.917
and now messing with you,
I owe the IRS money

21:40.917 --> 21:43.750
and got the Armenian Mafia
coming after me.

21:43.750 --> 21:45.250
They got no people in Reno.

21:45.250 --> 21:47.208
I looked into it.

21:47.208 --> 21:49.166
You don't get it, do you?

21:49.166 --> 21:50.917
You know what I want, Mick?

21:50.917 --> 21:53.166
I want a car, a job,
and a normal life

21:53.166 --> 21:56.333
and a woman who, when she says
she's bringing me coffee,

21:56.333 --> 21:58.083
brings me coffee
instead of stealing my money

21:58.083 --> 21:59.792
and taking your car.

21:59.792 --> 22:01.166
Who--who--whose car?

22:01.166 --> 22:02.083
You can go to Reno
if you want,

22:02.083 --> 22:04.166
but my black ass
ain't coming.

22:04.166 --> 22:06.458
Whose car?

22:06.458 --> 22:10.542
Ow! Shit!

22:10.542 --> 22:13.208
You know, I believe that God
brought you back to me, Ray.

22:13.208 --> 22:15.083
No, I do.
I mean, look at you.

22:15.083 --> 22:16.750
You're going down
for the one fucking murder

22:16.750 --> 22:18.291
you didn't commit.

22:18.291 --> 22:19.792
I mean,
that's divine retribution.

22:19.792 --> 22:21.291
Aah-ha!

22:21.291 --> 22:23.375
Ow! Shit!

22:23.375 --> 22:25.417
Where's the poker?

22:25.417 --> 22:27.333
Have you checked
your ass, Ray?

22:27.333 --> 22:29.125
Ow!

22:29.125 --> 22:31.208
W-what'd you think
was gonna happen?

22:31.208 --> 22:33.291
What, did you think you'd be
sitting at the Super Bowl

22:33.291 --> 22:36.083
in a skybox with the Finneys,
sipping Cristal

22:36.083 --> 22:40.125
while Beyoncé shakes her ass
for you down on the field?

22:40.125 --> 22:41.667
Ow! Fuck!

22:41.667 --> 22:43.333
You know, I have bolt cutters
in the van.

22:43.333 --> 22:44.792
I can cut off his testicles.

22:44.792 --> 22:46.291
Please, take my balls, okay?

22:46.291 --> 22:50.208
All they ever caused me
was trouble.

22:50.208 --> 22:52.041
Fuck you, Ray.

22:55.250 --> 22:56.458
All right, all right, all right!
It's in your apartment!

22:56.458 --> 22:58.500
It's in the heating vent
in the bedroom, okay?

22:58.500 --> 23:01.250
But I already called the cops,
so you're too fucking late.

23:01.250 --> 23:03.417
Even if you get there
on time, Ray,

23:03.417 --> 23:05.417
it's still your word
against Andrew Finney's.

23:05.417 --> 23:07.125
Who's gonna believe you?

23:07.125 --> 23:10.500
You're a fucking nobody.

23:10.500 --> 23:13.250
You fucking moron!

this door down.

This shouldn't take long.

23:59.083 --> 24:00.959
Take all the time you need.

24:10.041 --> 24:11.917
What happened here?

24:15.208 --> 24:17.125
I don't recall.

24:23.125 --> 24:25.583
You recognize that face?

24:25.583 --> 24:28.125
That is a picture
taken of Varick Strauss

24:28.125 --> 24:30.458
driving into Mexico
on his way to Belize,

24:30.458 --> 24:33.083
but that's not Varick,
is it?

24:33.083 --> 24:34.667
- Hard to tell.
- Really?

24:34.667 --> 24:36.291
'Cause
his name is Avi Rudin,

24:36.291 --> 24:37.542
and he's worked for you
for 15 years.

24:37.542 --> 24:38.917
Still not ringing any bells?

24:38.917 --> 24:40.083
It's a pretty grainy picture.

24:40.083 --> 24:41.917
[man]
Captain.

24:47.083 --> 24:50.291
Didn't find
what you're looking for?

24:50.291 --> 24:52.250
You can keep that.

24:52.250 --> 24:55.250
Maybe something
will come back to you.

24:55.250 --> 24:57.000
All right, guys, let's go.

25:02.333 --> 25:05.375
- Where you going?
- Oh, hey.

25:05.375 --> 25:08.875
I'm--I'm going over to my friend
Debbie's to grab my homework.

25:08.875 --> 25:10.625
Why doesn't she
