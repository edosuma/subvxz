WEBVTT

00:19.900 --> 00:21.367
What's going on?

00:21.367 --> 00:22.467
Oh, not a whole lot.

00:22.467 --> 00:23.734
Thanks for coming over.

00:23.734 --> 00:28.133
I just wanted to let you know
that I'm going back to Alaska.

00:28.133 --> 00:29.667
Okay.

00:29.667 --> 00:34.166
So, when you get back,
you want to see old
airstrip out, new airstrip in.

00:34.166 --> 00:37.667
Well, the new airstrip in
and hopefully we can start
stripping on the old one.

00:37.667 --> 00:39.333
- Gotcha.
- I mean,
it's still a lot of work.

00:39.333 --> 00:40.400
I know.

00:40.400 --> 00:42.166
I mean, your existing
one's pretty terrible.

00:42.166 --> 00:44.500
So as long as it's an
improvement on that,
you're fine.

00:44.500 --> 00:46.500
- And it's not very flat.
- No.

00:46.500 --> 00:48.934
It's not very long
and it's very narrow.

00:48.934 --> 00:50.133
Okay.

00:50.133 --> 00:51.967
But you are going
to be the one flying
in and out of it.

00:51.967 --> 00:54.233
So I don't--
I don't want to see.

00:54.233 --> 00:56.266
Oh, that wasn't quite
long enough for...

00:56.266 --> 00:58.266
And that been upside
down in the pond.

00:58.266 --> 01:00.367
No, I don't want that either.

01:00.367 --> 01:03.367
But yeah, if you could--
if you could get it done
while I'm gone.

01:03.367 --> 01:04.533
Okay, man.

01:04.533 --> 01:06.800
Well, we'll get after it,
and hopefully we can keep

01:06.800 --> 01:08.467
everything else running
while we're doing that.

01:08.467 --> 01:09.533
Thank you.
And good luck.

01:17.800 --> 01:20.967
We still have a lot of ground
to open up here,
here in the Yukon,

01:20.967 --> 01:24.300
and that starts
to get a little hairy
in the middle of the season.

01:25.867 --> 01:28.867
27-year-old
Parker Schnabel is fighting

01:28.867 --> 01:33.600
a war on two fronts
at his Klondike operation.

01:33.600 --> 01:38.367
They're battling to mine
more ground than ever before.

01:38.367 --> 01:42.166
Mitch and Tyson
have their hands full
with two plants running.

01:42.166 --> 01:45.900
They're right on the edge
of keeping up
with where we need

01:45.900 --> 01:48.700
to be in order
to get all the ground
mined this season.

01:50.800 --> 01:55.867
Parker heads back
to Alaska to keep
his new operation on track.

01:57.433 --> 01:59.000
Back and forth
like a yo-yo.

02:02.867 --> 02:05.266
When he returns
in five days,

02:05.266 --> 02:08.200
he wants to tally up
two weeks worth of gold.

02:12.433 --> 02:16.900
Parker's crew have
finished stripping
the bear cut and are running

02:16.900 --> 02:20.233
the dirt through
both of his wash plants,
but need to open up

02:20.233 --> 02:22.333
more ground to stay ahead,

02:24.266 --> 02:27.400
starting with the 2,000 foot
long runway

02:27.400 --> 02:31.967
that Parker uses to fly
in and out of the Yukon.

02:31.967 --> 02:36.100
A thousand feet southeast,
his crew must now also build

02:36.100 --> 02:38.967
a new airstrip
to keep the skies open.

02:43.967 --> 02:45.900
Well, we got a lot of mud
to move here,

02:45.900 --> 02:50.834
if Parkers want to see another
section of ground open up,
down on the airstrip.

02:50.834 --> 02:54.500
A project this size
is lots to be tackling
this time of year.

02:54.500 --> 02:57.166
So definitely going
to need some reinforcements.

02:57.166 --> 03:02.433
While Mitch builds
a new runway, Chris Doumitt
starts to strip the old one.

03:04.700 --> 03:06.333
It's all hands on deck.

03:06.333 --> 03:08.266
You know what I mean,
that's what we do.

03:08.266 --> 03:10.500
We help out around here.

03:10.500 --> 03:14.600
It feels good to be able to do
this at this age.

03:16.467 --> 03:20.300
Klondike old timer,
Ken Tatlow teams up
with Doumitt.

03:21.433 --> 03:24.266
Of the 84
in the first part
of September,

03:24.266 --> 03:28.634
I'm still able to get up here,
but one thing is,
at the end of the shift,

03:28.634 --> 03:31.400
it doesn't feel quite
as good as it does
in the morning.

03:33.367 --> 03:35.667
Hopefully
some of the best ground
we ever had.

03:35.667 --> 03:38.233
Now, something we definitely
do not want to leave behind.

03:42.634 --> 03:45.433
You know, opening up
this cat is certainly
going to be challenging.

03:45.433 --> 03:47.100
A lot of mud to move here.

03:51.500 --> 03:53.867
Speaking of moving, Ken,
why are you not moving?

04:02.233 --> 04:03.333
Hey, Ken.

04:03.333 --> 04:04.433
You all right over there, buddy?

04:04.433 --> 04:05.600
I see that cat
has been moving.

04:05.600 --> 04:07.066
It didn't break down on you,
did it?

04:07.066 --> 04:08.600
No, no, the cat's fine.

04:08.600 --> 04:11.200
It's just the operator
got stuck again.

04:11.200 --> 04:14.133
I'm sitting on some clay
and sandy material,

04:14.133 --> 04:17.533
so if you can help me out,
I'd greatly appreciate it.

04:17.533 --> 04:22.200
It has rained
a lot and it makes us
absolutely slop.

04:23.367 --> 04:24.533
Yeah, buddy.
No worries.

04:24.533 --> 04:25.667
I'll be right there.

04:25.667 --> 04:27.333
Okay.
Well, one thing for sure.

04:27.333 --> 04:29.200
I'll be here.

04:39.767 --> 04:40.867
All right, Ken.

04:40.867 --> 04:42.533
Let me try and get rid
of some of this for you.

04:42.533 --> 04:44.433
Okay, Mitch.
Thank you.

04:44.433 --> 04:45.600
You ain't kidding.

04:45.600 --> 04:46.767
This stuff's off, man.

04:46.767 --> 04:49.500
Might have to come dig
a little on the side there.

04:49.500 --> 04:51.634
It's just like you're standing
on quicksand.

04:57.934 --> 05:00.266
I could try and get a little
momentum there
and see what she does.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.867
Hopefully that's enough.

05:21.266 --> 05:22.667
Yeah, buddy.
Keep her going.

05:25.900 --> 05:27.300
Yeah.
Now, we got it.

05:27.300 --> 05:29.233
And I'll just get out
of this hole.

05:29.233 --> 05:30.333
No, stop.

05:34.900 --> 05:39.133
Mitch takes over
in the million dollar
D11 to check for damage.

05:56.834 --> 05:58.767
That does not feel right.

06:00.734 --> 06:01.900
Take a look.

06:09.367 --> 06:10.767
You see what's going on here?

06:11.500 --> 06:13.400
Oh, that's not good.

06:13.400 --> 06:15.600
This link is ready to break.

06:15.600 --> 06:17.567
And we're not going
to be able to keep going
on like this,

06:17.567 --> 06:19.667
because if we do,
what's going to happen
is this thing is going

06:19.667 --> 06:23.066
to snap in half and this cat
is going to be stranded out
here in the middle of nowhere.

06:23.066 --> 06:25.834
Hopefully we can get
her back up and run it quick
because as you can see,

06:25.834 --> 06:27.667
we've got a mess
going on here.

06:27.667 --> 06:29.667
This cat's the only way
we're getting
to the bottom of it.

06:41.033 --> 06:43.533
Last week
was pretty much
our best gold week,

06:43.533 --> 06:45.433
but it isn't going to come out
of the ground itself.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.233
Third gear
mine boss Fred Lewis
is finally on a roll.

06:51.233 --> 06:55.634
He's banked 37 ounces of gold
so far this season,

06:55.634 --> 07:00.333
but it's a long way
to go before he hits
his 500 ounce goal.

07:00.333 --> 07:02.900
We set ourselves
a pretty aggressive goal
this season.

07:02.900 --> 07:04.367
We got a lot on the line.

07:04.367 --> 07:07.367
Fuel isn't cheap,
but this group of vets,
I know they've been through

07:07.367 --> 07:10.367
this [bleep] before
and quite frankly, I think
they work better in it.

07:13.166 --> 07:16.800
It's a [bleep] stripping
and ripping down, man.

07:16.800 --> 07:20.266
Fred's crew
are on good pay
in the Freedom Cut.

07:20.266 --> 07:23.867
Last week, they doubled
their season gold haul.

07:23.867 --> 07:28.600
Now they must keep up
the pace feeding
sergeants sluice.

07:32.133 --> 07:34.934
So we've got the 250
over at the wash plant
pumping pay,

07:34.934 --> 07:36.734
but we need a 220 over there.

07:36.734 --> 07:38.433
It's got to be pulling
the overburden

07:38.433 --> 07:39.967
and the tailings away
at the same time.

07:39.967 --> 07:42.300
So without this over there,
we really can't run.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.367
Are you [bleep] kidding me?

07:53.367 --> 07:54.533
Full derate.

07:57.467 --> 07:58.834
This is not good.

08:05.533 --> 08:06.734
Stop beeping.

08:14.100 --> 08:15.700
JB, JB, this is Fred.

08:15.700 --> 08:16.734
How copy over.

08:17.533 --> 08:18.567
Hey, Fred.

08:18.567 --> 08:19.800
Hey, I got bad news, bro.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.834
The 220 is in full derate.

08:21.834 --> 08:24.133
It won't even
rev up or anything.

08:24.133 --> 08:25.734
Negative.
And it's beeping.

08:25.734 --> 08:27.033
It won't shut up.

08:27.033 --> 08:29.133
Without that computer,
we can't reset code,

08:29.133 --> 08:30.233
and it won't do nothing.

08:30.233 --> 08:31.333
Rodger that.

08:34.433 --> 08:35.700
That really
right there,

08:35.700 --> 08:39.100
because it's not just
a mechanical issue.

08:39.100 --> 08:41.433
It's not something
we can just put the new part
in and go.

08:41.433 --> 08:45.967
It's something we absolutely
have to have a certified
technician to reset the code.

08:47.467 --> 08:52.200
In full derate mode,
the 220 is stuck on low power

08:52.200 --> 08:54.500
and can't lift heavy loads.

08:55.500 --> 08:56.867
What's up, guys?

08:58.133 --> 08:59.734
Oh, please tell me great news.

09:00.800 --> 09:01.834
Okay.
Well, see you.

09:03.600 --> 09:06.300
Um, 220 is full derate.

09:07.100 --> 09:08.200
What?

09:08.200 --> 09:10.100
220 is in full derate mode.

09:10.100 --> 09:11.266
It's not good.

09:11.266 --> 09:14.734
What that means is, Christopher,
it's a lot to ask,

09:14.734 --> 09:16.266
but you're going
to basically be stuck

09:16.266 --> 09:19.300
in the 250 indefinitely
feeding the wash plant.

09:20.200 --> 09:22.567
Guys, we got to make
this happen.

09:22.567 --> 09:25.166
You know that that goal
we set's pretty aggressive

09:25.166 --> 09:27.033
and we're not going to hit it,
if we just sit around

09:27.033 --> 09:28.300
and wait for things
to get fixed.

09:28.300 --> 09:30.533
- Yeah.
- So let's adapt, overcome.

09:30.533 --> 09:32.767
It is what it is.
Take the kick and move on.

09:37.166 --> 09:42.800
The 28 ton 250
excavator must now do
the job of two machines.

09:42.800 --> 09:46.734
It'll have to feed the plant
and clear the tailings.

09:48.567 --> 09:52.934
As much as I like being paid
and getting gold
and all that cool stuff,

09:52.934 --> 09:54.533
I hate being in the plant

09:57.367 --> 10:00.300
because of boring past jobs.

10:02.934 --> 10:06.634
22-year-old
Chris Parker became
Fred's stepson,

10:06.634 --> 10:08.266
winning the seven years old.

10:11.634 --> 10:14.066
You know,
people who think that like,

10:14.066 --> 10:18.567
oh, my [bleep] you're the--
you're the boss' son,
and that must be so nice.

10:18.567 --> 10:20.533
No, it [bleep] sucks.

10:23.333 --> 10:26.300
I can get the axe just
as much as anyone else can.

10:33.166 --> 10:34.700
Oh, what the [bleep].

10:40.133 --> 10:41.500
Hey, Buzz, you got a coffee?

10:41.500 --> 10:45.367
I think I just broke
the pen off the 250 track.

10:45.367 --> 10:47.000
So I'll pull out, Chef.

10:47.000 --> 10:51.400
First thing I got to do
is fix the [bleep] track.

10:51.400 --> 10:55.333
Yukon local buzz
has already had to fix
the track

10:55.333 --> 10:57.734
on the 250 once this season.

10:58.433 --> 11:00.066
Just popped off.

11:00.066 --> 11:02.734
Might be a bit of a hassle,
but we'll get it.

11:02.734 --> 11:04.200
Pick it up, flip it over,

11:05.200 --> 11:07.567
hopefully get it back
on that sprocket.

11:07.567 --> 11:09.600
Roll it on, tighten it up.

11:09.600 --> 11:11.100
Get back to [bleep] work.

11:11.100 --> 11:12.233
Yep.
Like that.

11:12.233 --> 11:13.767
Now push it up.

11:13.767 --> 11:15.834
Oh, I came up
over the hill hoping to see
this wash plant running

11:15.834 --> 11:17.767
and instead I see
everybody huddled around.

11:18.900 --> 11:20.200
Slide.

11:20.200 --> 11:21.600
Keep going bro.
Keep it.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.066
Go on, go on, go on.

11:23.066 --> 11:24.333
Come on, come on.

11:25.100 --> 11:26.467
Whoa, it's on.

11:28.200 --> 11:32.834
This season,
Fred's been hit by breakdown
after breakdown.

11:32.834 --> 11:34.433
Let's do it.
Stop the truck.

11:34.433 --> 11:37.367
Gears on his ruck
truck's wheel imploded.

11:38.300 --> 11:39.700
Holy [bleep].

11:39.700 --> 11:42.100
And the bracket
on his dozer cracked.

11:42.100 --> 11:45.100
There's only about
an inch of this piece
holds them together.

11:47.200 --> 11:49.133
What the
is up with the 250 like?

11:49.133 --> 11:50.333
I don't know.

11:50.333 --> 11:52.567
Christopher's been
a little hard on it.

11:52.567 --> 11:55.433
Do you think that those track
pin issues are related
to operator error

11:55.433 --> 11:57.433
or do you think
Christopher's doing
something he shouldn't?

11:57.433 --> 11:58.834
It has a lot to do with it.

11:58.834 --> 12:00.700
- Yeah.
- All right.

12:00.700 --> 12:02.834
I know It's kind of frustrating.

12:02.834 --> 12:04.500
It's not helping us.
It's hurting us pretty bad.

12:08.467 --> 12:09.500
Hey, Chris.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.967
So this is old equipment,
you know that, right?

12:13.967 --> 12:15.333
Pretty [bleep], I know. Yeah.

12:15.333 --> 12:16.533
I agree.
I agree.

12:16.533 --> 12:18.834
I've been talking
to JB about it,
and the consensus

12:18.834 --> 12:20.800
is that we're going
to pull you off the pile.

12:20.800 --> 12:24.567
We think that you're operating
the equipment a little bit
too rough up there.

12:24.567 --> 12:25.900
How?

12:25.900 --> 12:27.800
How am I operating
a bit too rough,
when I'm barely even moving?

12:27.800 --> 12:29.000
Well--

12:29.000 --> 12:30.634
I just said
that this equipment
is [bleep] garbage.

12:30.634 --> 12:31.967
I know you're not going
to like it.

12:31.967 --> 12:33.233
I'm going to pull you off
the pile.

12:33.233 --> 12:34.500
I'll just keep it,
keep it running.

12:34.500 --> 12:36.367
This is pretty ridiculous,
in my opinion.

12:36.367 --> 12:37.767
I'm not blaming you.

12:37.767 --> 12:40.734
What I'm saying is,
I'm going to pull you out
to see if it is you.

12:40.734 --> 12:43.300
The problem stops,
it was obviously you.

12:43.300 --> 12:46.100
And we'll figure out why
and we'll retrain you on it

12:46.100 --> 12:47.433
and we'll move forward
at that point.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.033
Don't hit me with the retrain.

12:49.033 --> 12:50.900
- I'm not--
- I don't need to be retrained.

12:50.900 --> 12:53.133
This is sounding pretty insulting.

12:53.133 --> 12:54.967
Well, I'm not trying
to sell you, Christopher.

12:54.967 --> 12:57.100
Right now the fact
of the matter is,
we need the plant running.

12:57.100 --> 12:59.900
And if it's a problem
that's caused by an operator,
we have to figure out why.

12:59.900 --> 13:01.033
All right?

13:01.033 --> 13:02.433
Well, that's a pretty decision.

13:05.734 --> 13:09.066
I'm [bleep] done with it.
I'm sick of it.

13:09.066 --> 13:10.467
Not going to deal
with it no more.

13:19.300 --> 13:21.200
Yeah.

13:34.233 --> 13:37.634
King of the Klondike,
Tony Beets is running

13:37.634 --> 13:41.700
paydirt 24 hours a day
out of two months to cuts.

13:41.700 --> 13:46.600
And so far, he's banked over
1,600 ounces of gold

13:46.600 --> 13:49.367
toward his 5,000 ounce
season target.

14:02.166 --> 14:05.066
To keep the plant fed
with a constant stream

14:05.066 --> 14:09.433
of gold rich pay,
Tony is alternating
between the two cuts.

14:27.300 --> 14:32.667
Tony jumps between
his nine acre Cold Cut
and six acre Blue Cut,

14:32.667 --> 14:38.634
sluicing white channel pay
from one, while he thaws
the pay channel in the other.

14:38.634 --> 14:40.800
So he doesn't stop
his wash plant.

14:40.800 --> 14:44.567
But the smaller blue cut
runs out of thawed pay

14:44.567 --> 14:47.300
before the Cold Cut
is ready to sluice.

14:50.400 --> 14:54.800
Tony plans to expand
the blue cut
by 40,000 square feet

14:54.800 --> 14:58.500
by the end of the week
to balance
their gold production

14:58.500 --> 15:01.834
and keep his wash plant
fed more consistently.

15:19.333 --> 15:21.667
My father literally
does not know how to relax.

15:21.667 --> 15:25.900
He relax maybe for like
two days and then becomes
a squirrely damn bastard.

15:27.166 --> 15:29.700
Tony's youngest son,
Mike Beets,

15:29.700 --> 15:32.767
has been placed in charge
of the cuts this season.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.400
Just right in front
of my cousin here.

15:37.367 --> 15:38.634
Hey, Cousin.

15:41.400 --> 15:43.066
How much longer until
you think you're done?

15:44.734 --> 15:46.100
An hour.

15:46.100 --> 15:50.166
Alongside Cousin Mike,
he races to get the expansion

15:50.166 --> 15:56.300
done with the two biggest
dozers in Tony's fleet,
the D10 and D11.

16:00.767 --> 16:02.266
...my boots squealing.

16:02.266 --> 16:04.166
Damn,
that is annoying.

16:12.934 --> 16:15.066
No [bleep] traction.

16:15.066 --> 16:17.033
Any time I try to get
a full [bleep] blade,

16:17.033 --> 16:21.266
all I end up doing is sitting
there spinning half the time
instead of pushing it forward.

16:22.233 --> 16:24.734
Then the new grouser
is on the D10 here.

16:27.667 --> 16:33.033
The horizontal
grouser bars on Mike's D10
provide traction,

16:33.033 --> 16:37.133
but they're worn down,
making it impossible
for the dozers tracks

16:37.133 --> 16:39.667
to grip in the slick,
muddy conditions.

16:41.767 --> 16:43.600
Tony Beets, do you copy?
Tony Beets, do you copy?

16:43.600 --> 16:47.634
Yeah, the [bleep] grouser
on this D10 are basically
non-existent.

16:47.634 --> 16:51.433
Can we get Kevin to get
somebody to fix them?

16:51.433 --> 16:56.734
With the D10 down,
you only have the D11 to rip
and we have a

16:56.734 --> 16:58.433
load of ripping
that needs being done.

17:02.200 --> 17:04.100
We're getting later
into the season.

17:05.166 --> 17:07.400
Ground is starting
to freeze up again.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.934
So yeah, stripping
will be a lot harder.

17:13.033 --> 17:14.333
What's going on here?

17:16.200 --> 17:17.233
Yeah.

17:17.233 --> 17:18.533
These tracks
are really bad too.

17:18.533 --> 17:20.767
They're even worse
than the D10.

17:20.767 --> 17:25.934
Worn down
by the harsh Yukon terrain,
both dozers now need

17:25.934 --> 17:29.433
critical maintenance
at the worst possible time.

17:30.500 --> 17:33.200
It's a real [bleep] pushing.

17:33.200 --> 17:36.000
When you lose traction,
then your tracks
spin constantly

17:36.000 --> 17:37.500
instead of you pushing
it forward.

17:41.700 --> 17:43.767
This one will be down
for a while.

17:45.166 --> 17:48.567
Both dozers are down,
bringing the Blue Cut

17:48.567 --> 17:52.900
expansion to a halt,
stopping Tony
from getting enough pay

17:52.900 --> 17:55.634
to last the rest of
the season.

17:55.634 --> 17:57.967
It's a really,
really bad time to have
the dozer down

17:57.967 --> 17:59.600
because now we don't have
any ripper cats.

18:10.266 --> 18:15.667
We're using whatever
good material we can find
to build the airstrip on them.

18:15.667 --> 18:18.700
Tyson Lee paves
the way for the new runway.

18:20.333 --> 18:23.367
Make sure,
it's smooth and level
and 1,000 feet long.

18:27.233 --> 18:32.433
In the Bear Cut
both of Parker's wash plants
chew through stockpiled dirt.

18:34.533 --> 18:37.300
We're nearly out of pay.

18:37.300 --> 18:41.800
Hopefully the guys have
the next cut's ready for me.

18:41.800 --> 18:45.133
While Ken
and Doumitt race
to strip the old runway.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.834
He's got to get
all this ground stripped.

18:48.834 --> 18:51.700
So the push is really
on to get this done.

18:53.300 --> 18:56.100
But without the power
of their D11 dozer,

18:56.100 --> 18:58.500
Parker's crew
won't be able to keep up

18:58.500 --> 19:01.667
with the wash plants
and risk running out of pay.

19:02.700 --> 19:04.266
Jordan,
what's happening, man?

19:04.266 --> 19:06.033
You're probably
going to tell me.

19:06.033 --> 19:07.233
Ha, ha.

19:07.233 --> 19:09.867
Well, so I was running
this thing down on the runway,

19:09.867 --> 19:12.033
noticed to see
how loose track is.

19:12.033 --> 19:13.834
She looks like
she's about ready to let go.

19:13.834 --> 19:15.333
We're kind of
in a pickle without it.

19:15.333 --> 19:19.333
I do have spare used
tracks in the boneyard.

19:19.333 --> 19:22.300
Okay, they any good?

19:23.634 --> 19:26.533
They'll probably string
on this thing and it'll move.

19:26.533 --> 19:28.133
I'll go look at them.

19:28.133 --> 19:30.400
Ryan's in the yard,
so we'll go dig them out.

19:30.400 --> 19:33.000
Let's see, uh,
see what we can make of it.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.867
Well, the sooner
you can get her back running,

19:34.867 --> 19:36.066
man, and the better
off we are.

19:38.867 --> 19:42.433
Getting replacement
tracks for the D11
will take weeks.

19:42.433 --> 19:48.467
Mechanic Jordan sends
his gambling on a rusty
set of spares to do the job.

19:49.367 --> 19:51.066
Think of it like
a train track.

19:51.066 --> 19:55.000
Hook the new one up in line,
so it just train tracks
right on to the next track.

20:20.066 --> 20:25.266
Jordan lines up
the old and new tracks
so the dozer can roll across.

20:25.266 --> 20:27.066
Now,
that's what I'm talking about.

20:30.133 --> 20:31.266
It's good.

20:31.266 --> 20:32.333
It's fine.

20:32.333 --> 20:34.300
You just can't run
the loader very well.

20:35.934 --> 20:37.100
He got a really bad temper.

20:37.100 --> 20:38.433
I've known him
since I was two.

20:38.433 --> 20:39.834
It's very funny.
We have a lot of fun.

20:39.834 --> 20:41.634
Go up and get [bleep] back up.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.934
Okay, so we made
a train track.

20:46.934 --> 20:47.967
Choo-choo.

20:56.233 --> 20:59.033
Just making sure
that the idlers
and the rock guards

20:59.033 --> 21:02.767
are staying square
in the old track
so that when he comes

21:02.767 --> 21:06.533
on to the new track,
it lines up perfectly
and we have no issues.

21:07.634 --> 21:10.266
If it falls off this track,
it's a horrible event

21:10.266 --> 21:12.634
and it'll take hours
to get it back on.

21:25.066 --> 21:26.100
Looking good.

21:36.734 --> 21:38.066
Just got to get her on.

21:40.734 --> 21:43.767
Jordan pulls the new track up
over the rollers

21:43.767 --> 21:45.266
by backing up the dozer.

21:57.667 --> 21:58.867
Oh, [bleep].

22:01.367 --> 22:03.033
We've got to redo
everything again.

22:06.934 --> 22:09.667
Some profound words
I was using there.

22:10.333 --> 22:11.400
Do you wanna just go ahead?

22:11.400 --> 22:13.600
I'll just run the tracks,
check the chain back over.

22:15.400 --> 22:18.500
When you're going over
the sprockets, the--

22:18.500 --> 22:21.433
the hook just grabbed
the sprocket
and just undid the chain.

22:37.634 --> 22:39.100
She is so close.

22:47.667 --> 22:49.000
This has to go on.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.533
We'll just going to snug it up
with this Crescent
wrench here.

22:54.533 --> 22:55.600
We're really close.

22:55.600 --> 22:56.934
We're just putting
the bolts in.

22:56.934 --> 22:59.800
We're going to torque them
and tighten the track

22:59.800 --> 23:04.433
and then,
they can go back to work
and be happy, happy.

23:05.867 --> 23:07.200
Ta da!

23:07.200 --> 23:10.000
Now the D11 is back in action.

23:10.000 --> 23:13.767
Mitch and his crew raced
to strip the old runway,

23:13.767 --> 23:18.467
build the new runway,
and keep the wash plants fed.

23:18.467 --> 23:21.467
So we've got a lot of work
just cutting this
airstrip out,

23:21.467 --> 23:24.500
let alone moving
the material underneath it.

23:24.500 --> 23:26.166
Time to get back after it.

23:26.166 --> 23:27.367
Get some dirt moved.

23:41.700 --> 23:45.233
Every [bleep] upsets us back
instrumentally with that 250

23:45.233 --> 23:47.467
being our only vehicle
right now.

23:47.467 --> 23:49.533
You've got to make it work
or we're not going to hit
our goal.

23:50.700 --> 23:52.233
Fred's stepson, Chris,

23:52.233 --> 23:55.033
is benched
after popping a track

23:55.033 --> 23:58.100
on their only working
excavator, the 250.

23:59.467 --> 24:03.000
Being a mine boss
and the father
on the same job site

24:03.000 --> 24:04.400
is definitely not easy.

24:06.634 --> 24:09.066
Key to this operation
is a 250 feeding the plant.

24:09.066 --> 24:12.467
Whether or not my son
is a problem
is yet to be decided,

24:12.467 --> 24:14.634
but I had to make
the tough decision.

24:14.634 --> 24:15.700
And we've got to move forward.

24:15.700 --> 24:16.900
We've got to get that gold.

24:18.300 --> 24:22.667
Fred replaces Chris
with new recruit Ray Powers.

24:22.667 --> 24:24.166
Oh girl, are you going
to be nice to me.

24:24.166 --> 24:26.967
To find out
if the 250 is suffering

24:26.967 --> 24:32.467
from a malfunction
or if the earlier breakdown
was operator error.

24:32.467 --> 24:35.900
Okay, here we go.
Please do not break.

24:43.900 --> 24:45.567
Booyah.

24:47.867 --> 24:48.934
Yeah.

24:48.934 --> 24:51.967
So Buzz, I've known
for 30 plus years

24:51.967 --> 24:54.000
and I do as wood sales
for him.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.700
Firewood and run his
lumber mill for him.

24:57.700 --> 25:03.000
And one night,
Mr. Fred Lewis is there
and we get talking

25:03.000 --> 25:06.800
and unbeknownst to me,
offers me a job.

25:09.233 --> 25:11.567
Let's see.
What's my experience
at mining?

25:11.567 --> 25:14.233
Well, gold mining, bupkis.

25:15.834 --> 25:21.667
Coal mining,
just a couple of months
shy of 20 years.

25:52.367 --> 25:54.000
me.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.934
track again, man.

25:55.934 --> 25:57.967
Hey, Buzz, you got a copy?

25:57.967 --> 25:59.066
Yeah, go ahead.

25:59.066 --> 26:00.233
Yeah.

26:00.233 --> 26:02.634
This stupid [bleep] track
come off again, man.

26:02.634 --> 26:03.867
Guys, we get sick of this.

26:03.867 --> 26:05.033
We've got to be working.

26:11.767 --> 26:13.533
It's not like
I was doing much other than

26:13.533 --> 26:15.734
trying to walk down
off the [bleep] down pile,

26:15.734 --> 26:17.567
so I could do
what I was supposed to do.

26:17.567 --> 26:18.634
Yeah.

26:18.634 --> 26:20.033
You think you could have
left it

26:20.033 --> 26:22.033
in a better spot, man?

26:22.033 --> 26:23.100
Do your thing, my man.

26:23.100 --> 26:24.667
Let's get her off
and get her fixed

26:24.667 --> 26:26.333
and so I can get back to work.

26:31.867 --> 26:33.834
I'll start by getting it down.

27:13.634 --> 27:15.967
The 250 slip track
has allowed

27:15.967 --> 27:18.700
the tension idler to drop out.

27:18.700 --> 27:20.967
The excavator
can't run without it.

27:28.066 --> 27:30.600
Wrecked pieces
are [bleep] pain in the ass.

27:30.600 --> 27:32.967
The root of all evil
is this thing right here.

27:32.967 --> 27:35.600
This is why I believe
that this track

27:35.600 --> 27:38.033
is freaking constantly
popping pins

27:38.033 --> 27:40.934
cause this here works
kind of like a shock absorber.

27:40.934 --> 27:42.233
This is like seized.

27:42.233 --> 27:43.333
It doesn't move at all.

27:43.333 --> 27:45.467
All that tension goes
into the pins

27:45.467 --> 27:47.767
rather than
into the shocking system.

27:47.767 --> 27:48.967
It really sucks.

27:50.834 --> 27:54.066
Without a working excavator
to feed the plant,

27:54.066 --> 27:56.600
Fred's operation
is shut down.

27:56.600 --> 27:57.767
You know at this point,

27:57.767 --> 27:59.900
every time this thing
goes down,

27:59.900 --> 28:02.900
it's costing us potentially
lost gold because we're--

28:02.900 --> 28:04.066
We're not losing the gold.

28:04.066 --> 28:07.800
It's still in the ground,
but it's not in our sluice.

28:07.800 --> 28:12.433
First,
Buzz fixes the idler
to release the tension.

28:12.433 --> 28:14.567
He removes debris
from the spring.

28:14.567 --> 28:16.600
So you're just
trying to break up
what's inside there

28:16.600 --> 28:18.533
and see if it,
maybe it's gummed up.

28:18.533 --> 28:21.533
A little backed off
or something pull
that out and see

28:21.533 --> 28:22.700
what we can make happen.

28:25.233 --> 28:26.767
Well, well, well.

28:27.934 --> 28:30.467
I bet you feel pretty
stupid right about now,

28:30.467 --> 28:32.233
blaming me
for this [bleep] problem.

28:32.233 --> 28:34.066
Well, in my defense...

28:34.066 --> 28:36.433
I didn't know that
it was breaking on its own.

28:36.433 --> 28:37.567
I want an apology.

28:37.567 --> 28:38.700
I'm not apologizing.

28:38.700 --> 28:40.100
- Apologize me, right away.
- Okay.

28:40.100 --> 28:42.600
I do apologize
for blaming you for breaking

28:42.600 --> 28:45.100
a piece of machinery
that's prone
to break on its own.

28:45.100 --> 28:46.667
But we're going
to get it fixed.

28:46.667 --> 28:49.033
We're going to put the 250 up
on to feed the plant,

28:49.033 --> 28:50.867
keep you from breaking
the track pin.

28:50.867 --> 28:52.333
Apologize for blaming you.

28:52.967 --> 28:54.100
Don't break it again.

28:55.500 --> 28:57.367
I don't think
anyone can control
whether or not

28:57.367 --> 28:58.600
that [bleep] breaks.

28:58.600 --> 29:00.600
That's why we're going
to have to do it.

29:00.600 --> 29:02.233
[bleep] This, bro.

29:04.433 --> 29:06.233
Right now, we're just
putting the idler back in

29:06.233 --> 29:08.300
and get ready to put
the track back together.

29:08.300 --> 29:09.700
All right, Chris,
down a little bit.

29:12.433 --> 29:13.834
Down a little bit.

29:13.834 --> 29:15.500
Oh, yeah.
That looks good.

29:15.500 --> 29:16.967
And then cut this way
a little bit.

29:20.800 --> 29:22.834
Look at that.

29:22.834 --> 29:23.834
Thanks.

29:26.533 --> 29:28.000
Idler's fixed.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.533
The tracks can now
be rolled back on.

29:31.734 --> 29:33.000
All right.

29:33.000 --> 29:36.567
So now we got
to rehook them back
to keep all that tension.

29:36.567 --> 29:38.066
If we hit down
right here.

29:39.567 --> 29:41.300
Okay. All right.
We're on the wheel now.

29:46.100 --> 29:48.266
Got the track tension
back together

29:48.266 --> 29:50.667
and it's ready to get
back up on that pile

29:50.667 --> 29:53.934
and start the plant
and start to now get running.

29:53.934 --> 29:57.100
Okay, girl.
Let's see if you're together.

30:00.100 --> 30:02.467
Well, that's a start.

30:02.467 --> 30:03.700
You go in both directions.

30:03.700 --> 30:05.266
Okay.

30:05.266 --> 30:09.000
Let's get to work
so we can get things
on the go here.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.066
Ready?

30:18.100 --> 30:19.467
Woo-hee!

30:21.033 --> 30:22.166
Put some hours in.

30:24.900 --> 30:27.500
That's a good tense bro!

30:50.600 --> 30:54.567
Right now,
two of our biggest
dozers are down.

30:56.467 --> 30:59.166
I just hope that whatever pay
that we have left

30:59.166 --> 31:02.266
is going to be enough
to keep the plant running.

31:03.600 --> 31:06.700
Tony is running
out of pay in the Blue Cut.

31:06.700 --> 31:09.800
If he doesn't get his dozers
repaired fast,

31:09.800 --> 31:14.233
he won't finish the expansion
and he'll run out of paydirt.

31:24.634 --> 31:26.467
Well, we have
both big cats down.

31:29.233 --> 31:31.567
Once we run out
of [bleep] dirt,

31:31.567 --> 31:32.634
we ain't got
to do.

31:32.634 --> 31:34.667
Yeah.

31:34.667 --> 31:37.066
On the go for myself,
Way too [bleep] much.

31:37.066 --> 31:38.533
This is more
of a welding job anyway.

31:44.934 --> 31:47.433
Tony needs to add
three inches to each

31:47.433 --> 31:51.200
of the 96 grousers
on the D10 and D11.

32:16.166 --> 32:17.567
Tony's plan,

32:17.567 --> 32:21.133
jack up both dozers
on a custom-built
steel platform.

32:23.200 --> 32:25.834
This allows the tracks
to spin freely,

32:25.834 --> 32:30.567
so his crew can safely reach
the underside
to replace the grousers.

32:37.800 --> 32:41.433
So the front of the D10
has two eyes on the bottom

32:41.433 --> 32:45.900
and we want the stand to sit
very stable so it's safer.

32:49.567 --> 32:53.367
Cousin Mike
starts by cutting
a pair of steel eyes

32:53.367 --> 32:57.900
that will lock
to the underside
of the 63-ton D10.

32:57.900 --> 32:59.734
So we make eyes on the stand

32:59.734 --> 33:02.200
and then we'll fit this pin through.

33:02.200 --> 33:04.667
And then it's just solid
with dozer.

33:04.667 --> 33:06.033
So it won't go anywhere.

33:08.333 --> 33:11.467
They fix
the steel eyes to a crossbar,

33:11.467 --> 33:13.834
then lock it in place
beneath the dozer.

33:20.533 --> 33:23.066
- Ready?
- Yeah.

33:23.066 --> 33:24.367
There, that's it.

33:26.600 --> 33:29.000
So we finally got this piece
in here.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.467
Now we're ready to lift
the dozer up with the blade.

33:42.300 --> 33:44.634
Next, they
cut a steel platform

33:44.634 --> 33:46.834
that will fix to the crossbar

33:46.834 --> 33:48.867
and hold the weight
of the D10.

34:16.066 --> 34:20.233
Mike jacks up the D10
using the dozer's blade.

34:20.233 --> 34:24.333
But if Tony's steel platform
can't hold the dozer up,

34:24.333 --> 34:26.433
he won't be able
to get underneath

34:26.433 --> 34:27.934
to complete repairs.

35:09.033 --> 35:12.400
To replace
the track grousers
on the D10 dozer.

35:13.634 --> 35:16.400
Tony is counting
on his improvised platform

35:16.400 --> 35:19.533
holding the weight
of the 63-ton machine.

35:36.467 --> 35:40.000
Cousin Mike
welds both halves
of the platform together.

36:22.700 --> 36:25.033
With the D10 dozer secure,

36:25.033 --> 36:28.100
Tony's crew weld grousers
to its tracks.

36:32.734 --> 36:35.033
And they must
race against the clock

36:35.033 --> 36:37.934
to get the same job done
on the D11.

36:56.500 --> 36:57.900
Yeah. It did.

37:00.100 --> 37:01.200
Oh, yeah.

37:10.800 --> 37:11.867
Yep.

37:19.800 --> 37:23.033
Both dozers repaired
and back in the game,

37:23.033 --> 37:25.533
Mike and his crew
can now complete stripping

37:25.533 --> 37:28.233
the Blue Cut extension
by the end of the week.

37:31.800 --> 37:34.467
It's a good thing
they got them
grousers fixed in time.

37:36.033 --> 37:38.433
And we still have loads
of [bleep] ripping to do.

37:51.367 --> 37:53.600
We've just completed
our new airstrip

37:53.600 --> 37:55.500
and we're going to give it
a little test drive here

37:55.500 --> 37:57.400
in the pickup and see
how it feels.

37:57.400 --> 37:58.967
Hopefully it's pretty smooth.

37:58.967 --> 38:00.967
Parker took off
on the old airstrip.

38:00.967 --> 38:02.500
He's going to be landing
on this one.

38:04.100 --> 38:06.500
Mitch and Tyson
have finally completed

38:06.500 --> 38:10.433
the new 2,500-foot-long runway
on Parker's plane.

38:13.166 --> 38:15.266
It feels pretty good
in the pickup.

38:15.266 --> 38:17.233
It feels like
getting an airplane.

38:17.233 --> 38:19.967
It's long, pretty flat.

38:19.967 --> 38:23.266
We got it in here,
graded it,
rolled it with the trucks.

38:23.266 --> 38:27.700
Really, the next thing
is moving the wind socks
down here.

38:27.700 --> 38:29.200
And this thing
is going to be ready to go.

38:37.433 --> 38:38.634
Tyson, you got a copy?

38:38.634 --> 38:39.800
Tyson?

38:39.800 --> 38:41.567
Go ahead.

38:41.567 --> 38:44.266
Hey, man, we're ready
to move some wind socks here.

38:44.266 --> 38:48.000
You want to grab a loader
and we'll get our new
airstrip up and rolling.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.233
Sounds good man.

39:00.166 --> 39:03.934
Nothing like moving
some wind socks
in 35 degree weather.

39:03.934 --> 39:05.100
- Hey.
- Yeah, dude.

39:08.634 --> 39:09.967
And you just
kind of back up.

39:09.967 --> 39:11.500
Yep.

39:11.500 --> 39:12.700
That'll work perfect.

39:17.700 --> 39:19.066
There it is, right there.

39:19.066 --> 39:20.333
That's the finishing touch.

39:21.400 --> 39:22.767
Hopeful everybody likes it.

39:26.100 --> 39:28.333
Parker is back
in the Yukon,

39:28.333 --> 39:33.033
ready to see how much gold
his crew has banked
in the past two weeks.

39:41.166 --> 39:44.367
Well, it looks like the boys
got the old--

39:44.367 --> 39:46.700
the old airstrip out
and a new one in.

39:46.700 --> 39:48.634
And we landed on it,
and I'm alive.

39:49.634 --> 39:51.433
So I guess it worked.

39:53.467 --> 39:55.867
Let's see what kind of trouble
these guys got into
while I was gone.

40:12.200 --> 40:17.433
At Paradise Hill,
Tony teaches his crew about
a Dutch tradition.

40:42.800 --> 40:44.533
Oh, my God.

40:44.533 --> 40:45.967
That is cheating.

40:53.166 --> 40:54.533
Told you.
I told you so.

41:10.467 --> 41:11.533
Hey, JB.

41:11.533 --> 41:14.367
Is that coffee
or we doing a gold weigh?

41:14.367 --> 41:15.734
Oh, it's some grounds
all right.

41:15.734 --> 41:16.900
All right.

41:16.900 --> 41:19.734
Last week,
Fred's misfits were on a roll

41:19.734 --> 41:22.100
with their best gold
weigh yet.

41:22.100 --> 41:25.433
From 2,100 yards
of Freedom Cut paydirt,

41:25.433 --> 41:29.266
they banged
18.5 ounces of gold.

41:29.266 --> 41:31.800
So we're looking
at 2,100 yards this week.

41:31.800 --> 41:33.367
Obviously,
we had a lot of problems

41:33.367 --> 41:34.767
with that damn 250 track.

41:34.767 --> 41:37.634
We had to put it up
on the mound and 2,100 yards

41:37.634 --> 41:40.233
is what we should be running
in a day and a half,
not a week.

41:40.233 --> 41:41.667
Equipment issues
can't be the reason

41:41.667 --> 41:43.667
why we're not hitting
our goal.
We've got to figure it out.

41:43.667 --> 41:45.233
If we have to adapt
our mining plan

41:45.233 --> 41:47.634
to work around
these deadweight

41:47.634 --> 41:48.700
pieces of equipment,

41:48.700 --> 41:50.000
that's what we're going
to have to do.

41:50.900 --> 41:53.066
All right, Ray, on that note,

41:53.066 --> 41:54.567
you ready to read this
bad boy out?

41:57.533 --> 41:59.166
One, two.

41:59.166 --> 42:03.266
Fred needs
to deliver roughly
nine ounces of gold a day

42:03.266 --> 42:06.800
to hit
his 500-ounce target.

42:06.800 --> 42:08.834
But this week he only sluiced

42:08.834 --> 42:11.300
a day and a half's
worth of pay.

42:11.300 --> 42:17.800
There's the nine,
10, 12, 13, 14, 15.

42:21.400 --> 42:23.934
15.5 brother.

42:23.934 --> 42:25.433
Hey-hey.

42:25.433 --> 42:29.033
Worth over $26,000.

42:30.200 --> 42:31.634
But it's pretty
damn good actually.

42:31.634 --> 42:32.734
Yeah.

42:32.734 --> 42:36.533
So if we run 2,100 yards
and get 15 ounces off of it

42:36.533 --> 42:38.033
and we keep replicating that,

42:38.033 --> 42:42.400
we're above
our 9 to 10 ounces a day easy.

42:42.400 --> 42:43.500
So the goal is there, guys.

42:43.500 --> 42:44.600
That's cool.

42:44.600 --> 42:45.900
We just got to get
our [bleep] fixed.

42:45.900 --> 42:47.033
Yeah.

42:47.033 --> 42:48.600
You know,
that number is nice and all,

42:48.600 --> 42:50.867
but I'd rather be seeing 50.

42:50.867 --> 42:52.033
Wouldn't we all?

42:52.033 --> 42:55.300
And we can do that,
if you get back to work.

42:55.300 --> 42:56.734
I'm off shift, bro.

42:56.734 --> 42:57.800
I'm going back to bed.

42:57.800 --> 42:59.033
Well, let's go.

42:59.033 --> 43:01.066
Let's get the
out of here
and make it happen.

43:02.166 --> 43:03.800
Well, you got some
digging to do.

43:03.800 --> 43:04.934
Let's go.

43:07.700 --> 43:08.900
Good job, guys.

43:18.967 --> 43:20.467
Hello?

43:23.367 --> 43:25.967
I had to call
in reinforcements
to bring all the gold in.

43:27.100 --> 43:28.233
Yeah.

43:29.834 --> 43:31.567
The Beets
gather to find out

43:31.567 --> 43:34.700
how much gold they pulled
from their thawed stockpile

43:34.700 --> 43:36.634
of pay while their dozers

43:36.634 --> 43:39.266
were finishing
the Blue Cut expansion.

43:39.266 --> 43:41.433
It looks like we have quite
a bit of gold this week.

43:42.600 --> 43:43.667
Did we sluice all week?

43:43.667 --> 43:45.000
24 hours, seven days.

43:45.000 --> 43:46.634
That's pretty good.

43:51.033 --> 43:53.100
Let's do this thing.
One, two, three. Let's go!

43:53.100 --> 43:55.667
To hit his
5,000-ounce target,

43:55.667 --> 44:00.900
Tony needs to deliver
at least 350 ounces a week.

44:00.900 --> 44:02.934
150, 160,

44:07.867 --> 44:14.200
one-seventy,
180, 190, 210, 340, 350.

44:19.567 --> 44:23.200
Worth over $800,000.

44:25.734 --> 44:26.900
Mm-hmm.

44:33.734 --> 44:36.100
No, no, not at all.
If it stays that nice.

44:39.934 --> 44:41.433
Well, it doesn't take much
to add up.

44:50.467 --> 44:51.533
Let's be honest.

44:51.533 --> 44:53.567
You're not getting it for him,
you get this for me.

44:59.333 --> 45:01.100
Going to my side
of the family.

45:02.200 --> 45:03.734
Yeah.

45:03.734 --> 45:04.834
Let me think about it.

45:04.834 --> 45:05.934
No.

45:16.467 --> 45:17.500
He's not doing it.

45:17.500 --> 45:19.567
I have no idea.

45:19.567 --> 45:21.900
- Hey there, old climber.
- Hey, young fellow,
how are you?

45:21.900 --> 45:23.500
Good.
Welcome home.

45:23.500 --> 45:24.834
Yeah.

45:24.834 --> 45:26.333
Good to see you.

45:26.333 --> 45:29.066
It's been two weeks
since Parker's crew

45:29.066 --> 45:33.100
had a gold weigh,
and both Slucifer and Big Red

45:33.100 --> 45:34.867
have been running nonstop.

45:36.567 --> 45:37.667
Hey there, youngster.

45:37.667 --> 45:39.300
- Hi.
- Hey, man.

45:39.300 --> 45:41.333
Finally back in the Yukon,

45:41.333 --> 45:44.300
Parker is hoping
for a monster payday.

45:44.300 --> 45:46.834
Well,
thanks for coming up again.

45:46.834 --> 45:48.033
You're welcome.

45:48.033 --> 45:49.800
We always really like
having you here

45:49.800 --> 45:53.433
and appreciate the help
and the steady hand.

45:53.433 --> 45:55.433
Well, thank you very much.

45:55.433 --> 45:56.567
But it's good to be here.

45:56.567 --> 45:58.166
Good.
This is a second home.

45:58.166 --> 46:00.433
You came at...
you flew in back
to camp, didn't you?

46:00.433 --> 46:02.834
Every time I come back,
it's just--

46:02.834 --> 46:03.934
the whole landscape's changed.

46:03.934 --> 46:05.066
Yeah.

46:05.066 --> 46:07.567
Well, took off on one runway,
landed on different one.

46:07.567 --> 46:08.800
Yeah.

46:08.800 --> 46:10.467
I think that's great.

46:10.467 --> 46:11.734
- That runway?
- Yeah.

46:11.734 --> 46:12.967
Boy, it looks like
a beauty to me.

46:12.967 --> 46:14.033
Yeah.

46:14.033 --> 46:15.600
That's like, compared
to the old one.

46:15.600 --> 46:16.734
Oh.

46:16.734 --> 46:19.333
Moved the signs,
set the wind socks and,

46:19.333 --> 46:22.166
like, well, hopefully
they can land on it.

46:22.166 --> 46:23.266
Yeah.

46:23.266 --> 46:25.700
If we see a lot of smoke,
we'll know they couldn't.

46:26.700 --> 46:28.266
Yeah.

46:29.900 --> 46:31.100
This is why you've been gone.

46:31.100 --> 46:32.533
This is what we've put
on the table.

46:32.533 --> 46:34.066
So that's two weeks.

46:34.066 --> 46:35.266
That's for two weeks.

46:35.266 --> 46:38.533
My skill stops at 400 ounces,

46:38.533 --> 46:40.300
and that's big red
right there.

46:40.300 --> 46:42.900
All right,
so we got 400 and...

46:42.900 --> 46:44.066
All right, here we go.

46:46.367 --> 46:48.800
It's a double week
for Big Red,

46:48.800 --> 46:53.834
which this season is averaging
214 ounces of gold a week.

46:53.834 --> 46:55.800
88.6.

46:55.800 --> 46:58.800
So 488.6.

46:58.800 --> 46:59.867
Sweet.

46:59.867 --> 47:03.433
Worth over $830,000.

47:03.433 --> 47:04.667
Not bad, little run there.

47:04.667 --> 47:05.834
That's sweet.

47:05.834 --> 47:08.133
Slucifer
is the same situation,

47:08.133 --> 47:10.033
has 400 ounces there.

47:10.033 --> 47:11.400
And a bigger thermos.

47:11.400 --> 47:13.133
And a little bit bigger
thermos, there we go.

47:13.133 --> 47:14.667
Ready?

47:14.667 --> 47:17.100
Slucifer is also tallying up

47:17.100 --> 47:19.100
two weeks' worth of gold.

47:19.100 --> 47:23.233
An average
is 263 ounces a week.

47:23.233 --> 47:25.066
60, 70.
I bet it's going to be 100.

47:35.600 --> 47:37.300
Yeah.

47:37.300 --> 47:40.000
That's just over
1,000 ounces.

47:40.000 --> 47:43.266
It's 1,055.15.

47:44.200 --> 47:48.533
Worth $1.8 million.

47:48.533 --> 47:50.367
You know,
that's impressive, guys.

47:50.367 --> 47:51.467
Good job.

47:51.467 --> 47:53.500
The gold looks amazing
as always, doesn't it?

47:53.500 --> 47:54.767
Thanks, man.

47:54.767 --> 47:57.166
All right,
we better go eat some dinner.

47:57.166 --> 47:58.734
Take care, youngster.
