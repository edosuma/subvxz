[BREATHING HEAVILY]

37:14.982 --> 37:16.282
What the hell?

37:16.317 --> 37:18.384
[CELLPHONE RINGING]

37:20.988 --> 37:23.355
Uh... hello?

37:23.391 --> 37:24.623
JACINDA: <i> Henry, we found it.</i>

37:24.659 --> 37:26.492
<i>We found the slipper.</i>

37:26.527 --> 37:30.796
The glass just fit together.

37:30.832 --> 37:33.599
Henry, the shoe is real.

37:33.634 --> 37:34.533
I wish I could show you,

37:34.569 --> 37:37.470
but Lucy ran off with it somewhere.

37:37.505 --> 37:39.605
But I think this is good news, right?

37:39.640 --> 37:41.907
With the possible exception of
Lucy running with broken glass,

37:41.943 --> 37:43.008
yes.

37:43.044 --> 37:45.077
Yes, I think this is very good news.

37:45.113 --> 37:47.546
It can't be real.

37:47.582 --> 37:49.415
Can it?

37:49.450 --> 37:52.952
Did we find each other
in some other world?

37:52.987 --> 37:54.753
In a fairy tale?

37:54.789 --> 37:59.959
Well, I happen to know a
lot about that fairy tale,

37:59.994 --> 38:06.765
and there is one crucial
element still missing.

38:06.801 --> 38:08.300
[INHALES SHARPLY]

38:08.336 --> 38:09.935
Wait.

38:09.971 --> 38:12.049
I'm not her yet.

38:12.673 --> 38:16.475
I have a lifetime of
memories of Jacinda,

38:16.511 --> 38:18.144
a struggling single mom

38:18.179 --> 38:19.545
who never thought she'd have romance

38:19.580 --> 38:21.226
in her life again.

38:22.426 --> 38:28.287
And that Jacinda wants
to kiss this Henry.

38:28.322 --> 38:31.357
Is that okay?

38:31.392 --> 38:34.860
That is more than okay.

38:48.676 --> 38:50.009
Yes!

38:51.913 --> 38:55.147
I don't remember anything
from the other life.

38:55.183 --> 38:56.415
Did you kiss?

38:56.450 --> 38:57.583
- Yes.
- Lucy.

38:57.618 --> 39:01.053
There was no magical
thing, no... no pulse.

39:01.088 --> 39:04.456
The curse didn't break.

39:04.492 --> 39:06.225
It didn't work.

39:06.260 --> 39:07.893
I don't understand.

39:09.764 --> 39:11.130
Hold out your hands.

39:20.942 --> 39:24.143
Old love... Blood of your father.

39:24.178 --> 39:25.477
New love...

39:25.513 --> 39:28.080
Blood from the woman with whom
you wish to spend your life.

39:28.115 --> 39:29.582
What? Margot?

39:29.617 --> 39:31.591
- What do you know about Mar...
- Hush.

39:32.353 --> 39:34.086
Love betrayed...

39:34.121 --> 39:35.254
Key to the grove,

39:35.289 --> 39:37.356
which should've been my
daughter's birthright.

39:44.065 --> 39:45.831
So, what's supposed to happen?

39:53.608 --> 39:55.674
- Am I meant to...
- Please don't do this, Tilly.

39:55.710 --> 39:57.438
I'm just one life.

39:58.179 --> 39:59.578
If I truly am your father,

39:59.614 --> 40:03.571
then I'm asking you as a father,

40:04.485 --> 40:06.352
don't do this.

40:06.387 --> 40:08.324
I feel that it's true.

40:09.323 --> 40:11.746
You are my father.

40:12.226 --> 40:13.826
That's why I have to do this.

40:16.497 --> 40:18.664
I can't be responsible for killing you.

40:30.244 --> 40:33.579
ELOISE: Nature's witches, words unheard,

40:33.614 --> 40:38.183
our wishes worthless, worse than dirt.

40:38.219 --> 40:40.753
Until we learned what we were worth

40:40.788 --> 40:44.323
to turn our hurts into your burns.

40:44.358 --> 40:46.458
Our purest urges now emerge.

40:46.494 --> 40:50.796
Old for nursery, dark for church.

40:50.831 --> 40:52.998
Close the circle.

40:53.034 --> 40:55.167
Purge the earth.

41:00.474 --> 41:02.880
Hold on to your mother's hand, dear.

41:04.945 --> 41:06.345
I'm your family.
