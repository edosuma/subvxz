Thank you.

I actually consider myself

11:25.563 --> 11:27.532
a pretty good jump roper
myself.

11:27.533 --> 11:29.462
Do it. Do it.
Can you do it?

11:29.463 --> 11:30.745
No, but, those tricks

11:30.746 --> 11:32.029
that you were doing

11:32.030 --> 11:33.315
were so complicated

11:33.316 --> 11:34.599

already,

"How could you make this
more even more interesting?"

11:53.663 --> 11:54.795

Vivien, look,
you do remind me

12:03.663 --> 12:05.159
why I love this show.

12:05.160 --> 12:07.662
Because, you know, I started
off judging singing shows.

12:07.663 --> 12:08.959
Yes.

12:08.960 --> 12:10.630
And I find just singers being

12:10.631 --> 12:12.299
a bit boring.

12:12.300 --> 12:13.999
And I loved the variety,

12:14.000 --> 12:15.430
and this is the absolute

12:15.431 --> 12:16.859
definition of variety

12:16.860 --> 12:18.862
on a show like
"America's Got Talent."

Sweet.

12:34.930 --> 12:37.459
When I was younger...

12:37.460 --> 12:39.559
I used to be bullied a lot.

12:39.560 --> 12:42.129
And my teammates and my coach,

12:42.130 --> 12:45.429
they turn against me.

12:45.430 --> 12:47.315
And they always told me that

12:47.316 --> 12:49.199
I'm ridiculous,

12:49.200 --> 12:51.299
that I'm the clown of the club

12:51.300 --> 12:52.759
and things like that, so...

12:52.760 --> 12:54.762
But where are they
and look at you.

12:54.763 --> 12:56.360

Teen years old.

14:17.663 --> 14:19.610
To be honest, I just

14:19.611 --> 14:21.559
kind of sing and play piano.

14:21.560 --> 14:22.859
That's really about it.

14:22.860 --> 14:24.299
Sorry, let me try that again.

14:24.300 --> 14:25.929
My name is Joseph O'Brien,

14:25.930 --> 14:27.532
and I'm from Columbia,
Tennessee.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.562
Which is, like,
a really small town.

14:29.563 --> 14:31.062
Sorry, excuse me.
Pardon me.

14:31.063 --> 14:33.632
And I think there's probably
about 10,000 people.

14:33.633 --> 14:35.180
I am an indoor trampoline

14:35.181 --> 14:36.729

14:36.730 --> 14:38.602
which is a very
interesting job.

14:38.603 --> 14:39.965

14:39.966 --> 14:41.329
a figure of authority.

14:41.330 --> 14:42.630
I'm sorry. Just go again.

14:42.631 --> 14:43.929
I'm good. I'm good.

14:43.930 --> 14:45.759
So should I say it again?

14:45.760 --> 14:47.495
I'm 20 years old and I've never

14:47.496 --> 14:49.229
had a girlfriend.

14:49.230 --> 14:51.195
The only time I've ever asked

14:51.196 --> 14:53.159
a girl out was to coffee.

14:53.160 --> 14:55.102
Which is, sort of,
I guess a date.

14:55.103 --> 14:56.532
But in her brain it wasn't
a date.

14:56.533 --> 14:57.859
In my brain it was.

14:57.860 --> 14:59.459
A lot of my songs

14:59.460 --> 15:01.362
are wishes of wanting
to have a relationship.

15:01.363 --> 15:02.499
Nice to meet you.

15:02.500 --> 15:03.900
We're ready
for you on stage now.

15:03.901 --> 15:04.900
Okay.

15:04.901 --> 15:07.329
Are you married or...?

15:07.330 --> 15:08.815
You have a boyfriend?

15:08.816 --> 15:10.299
Nice, sweet. That's cool.

15:10.300 --> 15:11.700

of mine is just

15:11.701 --> 15:13.059
to be a full-time musician.

15:13.060 --> 15:15.132
And so "America's Got Talent"
is my chance

15:15.133 --> 15:16.499
to prove myself.

15:16.500 --> 15:18.132
When I step out onto
that stage,

15:18.133 --> 15:20.132
I really hope that
the judges like me.

15:20.133 --> 15:22.502
In order to not get nervous,
I heard there's this thing

15:22.503 --> 15:24.462
from the internet where you,
like, shake your hands

15:24.463 --> 15:26.102
on a constant, like,
constant basis

15:26.103 --> 15:27.860
'cause it gets rid of, like,
the energy

15:27.861 --> 15:29.299
that you have in your body.

15:29.300 --> 15:30.632
But I'm just gonna
give it my best

15:30.633 --> 15:32.532
and hopefully, you know,
do the best I can.

Hi.
Hi.

15:42.603 --> 15:44.129
Do tell us your name.

15:44.130 --> 15:45.399
My name's Joseph O'Brien.

15:45.400 --> 15:46.559

15:48.360 --> 15:50.702
And who did you come here
with today?

15:50.703 --> 15:52.500
I'm by myself today,

15:52.501 --> 15:54.299
so, you know, all alone.

15:54.300 --> 15:55.899
Just, you know.

15:55.900 --> 15:57.032

A wife? Or...

15:59.233 --> 16:00.395
No, I don't have

16:00.396 --> 16:01.559
a girlfriend.

16:01.560 --> 16:02.810
I've actually been single

16:02.811 --> 16:04.059
my entire life, so...

16:04.060 --> 16:05.302
No!
Really?

16:05.303 --> 16:06.830
Yes. Actually,

16:06.831 --> 16:08.359
never gone on a legit date

16:08.360 --> 16:09.559
or anything like that, so...

16:09.560 --> 16:10.902
Aw.
Really?

16:10.903 --> 16:13.200
But you're a handsome fella.
How's that possible?

16:14.230 --> 16:15.930
I guess, like, the right

16:15.931 --> 16:17.629
opportunity hasn't come along.

16:17.630 --> 16:19.702
So, have you ever snogged
anyone then?

16:19.703 --> 16:21.532
Have I ever what?
Snogged.

16:21.533 --> 16:22.802
I don't even know what
that means.

16:22.803 --> 16:24.030
What does snog mean?

16:24.031 --> 16:25.259
Snogging is kissing.

16:25.260 --> 16:26.462
Kissing.
Kissing with tongue.

16:26.463 --> 16:28.262
Have you ever kissed
anyone then?

16:28.263 --> 16:30.032
No. I have not.
You haven't?

16:30.033 --> 16:31.832
Really?
No kissing.

16:31.833 --> 16:33.699
No, it's not happened.

16:33.700 --> 16:36.699
Aw.

16:36.700 --> 16:38.229
It's gonna happen.

16:38.230 --> 16:40.829
Maybe, who knows.

16:40.830 --> 16:43.202
You're really nervous,
aren't you?

16:43.203 --> 16:45.432
No, I'm not nervous
at all, you know.

26:24.430 --> 26:26.329
He's very funny.

26:26.330 --> 26:27.380
Thank you, Howie.

26:27.381 --> 26:28.429
Thank you.

26:28.430 --> 26:30.532
Whoo, all right,
now I'm gonna sit here

26:30.533 --> 26:32.199
and here what I did wrong.

26:32.200 --> 26:34.359
Okay, let's start with Howie.

26:34.360 --> 26:35.702
You know what, okay.
I got to tell you,

26:35.703 --> 26:38.062
you are really funny,
you are really unique.

26:38.063 --> 26:39.229

26:43.396 --> 26:44.829
the three Xs really funny.

26:44.830 --> 26:47.102
Made what was going on
in this room really funny.

26:47.103 --> 26:48.529
Merci.

26:48.530 --> 26:50.145
I just--I loved it.

Thank you, Howie.

26:51.760 --> 26:53.332
Thank you.

26:53.333 --> 26:54.802
I'm actually gonna agree
with you, Howie.

26:54.803 --> 26:56.065
Because, I'm gonna

26:56.066 --> 26:57.329

they could do that.

27:04.300 --> 27:05.680
You're way funnier

27:05.681 --> 27:07.059
in the moment.

That's better.

My name is Glennis Grace,
I'm 39,

29:17.933 --> 29:20.499
and I'm a singer.

29:20.500 --> 29:22.732
Growing up I lacked
confidence,

29:22.733 --> 29:24.080
and I was

29:24.081 --> 29:25.429
a very insecure girl.

29:25.430 --> 29:27.595
My parents did not have

29:27.596 --> 29:29.760
the most amazing marriage.

29:30.830 --> 29:33.302
So there was a lot of tension
in the house.

And...

29:35.030 --> 29:37.129
You see the fights.

29:37.130 --> 29:38.895

perform for the whole world.

29:57.200 --> 29:59.199
That was my biggest dream.

29:59.200 --> 30:02.229
But then my baby boy was born,

30:02.230 --> 30:05.260
and he changed my life forever
in a really good way.

30:06.630 --> 30:08.332

I love you too.

than I did as a kid.

see a bit of you.

I have to say
that the only reason

34:56.433 --> 34:59.132
why you're not a star yet
is because we haven't seen you

34:59.133 --> 35:00.559

I wanted to do stand-up,

to be a comedian."

I was working for
my brother-in-law's company,

51:02.663 --> 51:04.862

I knew that was my calling.

51:04.863 --> 51:06.480

51:06.481 --> 51:08.099
I decided to leave.

51:08.100 --> 51:09.760

I would work

to do magic, boy,

51:25.901 --> 51:27.329
I was sleeping in my car.

I feel like I need some air.

01:00:29.230 --> 01:00:31.529
But a few years ago

01:00:31.530 --> 01:00:33.465
I kept feeling pain

01:00:33.466 --> 01:00:35.399
in my hands and my feet.

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:37.230
I learned that I had a nerve

01:00:37.231 --> 01:00:39.059
disease called neuropathy.

01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:41.080
And that it would make

01:00:41.081 --> 01:00:43.099
my nerves die slowly

01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:45.030
and very, very painfully.

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:47.999
Since I was diagnosed,

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.430
my hand's already

01:00:49.431 --> 01:00:50.859
partially numb.

01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:52.929
I can barely feel my toes,

01:00:52.930 --> 01:00:55.859
and the pain is 24/7.

01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:57.280
It's like all the nerves

01:00:57.281 --> 01:00:58.699
in my body are screaming

01:00:58.700 --> 01:00:59.865
at the same time,

01:00:59.866 --> 01:01:01.029
they're burning.

01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:02.395
Right now I can't feel

01:01:02.396 --> 01:01:03.759
the strings when I play.

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:05.410
I use my muscle memory

01:01:05.411 --> 01:01:07.059
from my fingers.

01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:08.560
I think the only reason

01:01:08.561 --> 01:01:10.059
I'm still able to play

01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:11.280
is because I haven't

01:01:11.281 --> 01:01:12.499
stopped.

01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:14.600
Being here on AGT means

01:01:14.601 --> 01:01:16.699
everything to me.

01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:18.130

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:26.150

01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:29.880

And today I will be performing
stand-up comedy.

01:07:16.003 --> 01:07:17.250

01:07:17.251 --> 01:07:18.499
the fascination

01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:20.062
and the love for
stand-up comedy.

01:07:20.063 --> 01:07:22.602
So I decided, okay,
I'll go to the comedy club

01:07:22.603 --> 01:07:24.000
on amateur night
and I thought,

01:07:24.001 --> 01:07:25.459
"Well, that's something."

01:07:25.460 --> 01:07:28.502
But it wasn't any money being
paid that you can live on.

01:07:28.503 --> 01:07:30.562
Few years passed and I had
to make a living.

01:07:30.563 --> 01:07:32.399
So I worked a variety of jobs,

01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:34.359

01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:35.829

01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:52.962

I'll get crazy

01:07:52.963 --> 01:07:54.899
and take a different route.

The passion and
the love of stand-up

01:08:01.563 --> 01:08:03.162
just got to be too much,
and at some point I decided

01:08:03.163 --> 01:08:05.559

And you are?

01:16:20.061 --> 01:16:21.429
My name's Brody Ray.

01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:22.445
Hi, Brody Ray.

01:16:22.446 --> 01:16:23.459
And where you from?

01:16:23.460 --> 01:16:25.099
I'm from Kearney, Nebraska.

01:16:25.100 --> 01:16:26.932
Wow.
Go, Big Red!

01:16:26.933 --> 01:16:28.402
Middle America.
Yeah.

01:16:28.403 --> 01:16:29.802
And what do you do
for a living?

01:16:29.803 --> 01:16:31.565
I do homecare for individuals

01:16:31.566 --> 01:16:33.329
with special needs.

01:16:33.330 --> 01:16:34.659

And then what are you going
to be doing for us tonight?

01:16:38.833 --> 01:16:41.262
I'm going to be singing
you guys a song called

01:16:41.263 --> 01:16:42.829
"Stand In The Light."

01:16:42.830 --> 01:16:44.229
Is that an original?

01:16:44.230 --> 01:16:45.862
No, it's a song
by Jordan Smith.

01:16:45.863 --> 01:16:47.830
And is there a reason

01:16:47.831 --> 01:16:49.799
you chose this song?

01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:51.065
It kind of applies

01:16:51.066 --> 01:16:52.329
to my life.

01:16:52.330 --> 01:16:54.145
You know, overcoming struggles

01:16:54.146 --> 01:16:55.959
and battles, and--

01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:57.195
What is the struggle

01:16:57.196 --> 01:16:58.429
that you've overcome?

01:16:58.430 --> 01:17:01.262
I actually was born female.
I'm transgendered.

01:17:01.263 --> 01:17:02.462
Oh. Good for you.
Really?

01:17:02.463 --> 01:17:03.829

01:17:08.730 --> 01:17:10.145
I was born and raised in

01:17:10.146 --> 01:17:11.559
Kearny, Nebraska.

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:14.129
Small town, 30,000 people.

01:17:14.130 --> 01:17:16.699
My name was Natalie.

♪ B, I, N, G, O ♪

01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:20.765
As a little kid I just loved

01:17:20.766 --> 01:17:22.829
to be the tomboy, you know.

01:17:22.830 --> 01:17:24.432
And I just wore
the guys clothes,

01:17:24.433 --> 01:17:26.029
I cut my hair off.

01:17:26.030 --> 01:17:28.359
I was just such a happy kid.

01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:29.680
But I kind of started

01:17:29.681 --> 01:17:30.999
to figure out

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.832
that it wasn't
just about clothes

01:17:32.833 --> 01:17:34.699
and short hair and all that.

01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:36.480
Inside I was a man.

01:17:36.481 --> 01:17:38.259
I was a boy.

01:17:38.260 --> 01:17:41.399
There was nothing I could do.

01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:42.902
I would just cry,
you know,

01:17:42.903 --> 01:17:45.102
and just feel
helpless and hopeless.

01:17:45.103 --> 01:17:46.832
And I was really close
with my family,

01:17:46.833 --> 01:17:49.662
but it was hard to talk about,
you know.

01:17:49.663 --> 01:17:53.229
I just--I tried to fit in.

01:17:53.230 --> 01:17:55.129
In elementary school,

01:17:55.130 --> 01:17:56.900
I was invited to
a girl's sleep over,

01:17:56.901 --> 01:17:58.429
and I went up to the bathroom.

01:17:58.430 --> 01:18:00.532
And I come back down,
and they had slid

01:18:00.533 --> 01:18:03.062
all of their sleeping bags
up against another wall.

01:18:03.063 --> 01:18:04.395
And they'd shoved mine in

01:18:04.396 --> 01:18:05.729
a corner and put tacks

01:18:05.730 --> 01:18:08.429
in my sleeping bag.

01:18:08.430 --> 01:18:10.559
That just, like, destroyed me.

01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:13.062
Like, what did I do to, like,
deserve that?

01:18:13.063 --> 01:18:15.860
Like, I know I'm different,
but I can't help it.

01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:19.762
Puberty, that was like
my worst nightmare.

01:18:19.763 --> 01:18:21.399
My body started changing.

01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:23.150
I was becoming more female

01:18:23.151 --> 01:18:24.899
than ever before.

01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:26.299
It felt wrong.

01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:27.980
It was just like I was trapped

01:18:27.981 --> 01:18:29.659
in a burning building.

01:18:29.660 --> 01:18:32.159
I just didn't want to go on.

01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:33.862
The one thing
that got me through

01:18:33.863 --> 01:18:35.859
was my music and my singing.

01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:37.330
It was giving me something

01:18:37.331 --> 01:18:38.799
to live for,

01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:40.515
and to stay alive for,

01:18:40.516 --> 01:18:42.229
and to fight for.

01:18:42.230 --> 01:18:43.995
But I never was

01:18:43.996 --> 01:18:45.759
really quite...

01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:47.330
complete as a person

01:18:47.331 --> 01:18:48.899
until I started

01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:51.565
my physical transformation

01:18:51.566 --> 01:18:54.229
to male in 2010.

01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:55.530
Finally, I started

01:18:55.531 --> 01:18:56.829
to look like

01:18:56.830 --> 01:18:58.395
the man that I always

01:18:58.396 --> 01:18:59.959
had felt on the inside.

01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:02.699
It was the start of my life

01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:04.862
and now
that I'm fully transitioned,

01:19:04.863 --> 01:19:06.545
people are seeing me

01:19:06.546 --> 01:19:08.229
as to who I really am.

01:19:08.230 --> 01:19:09.380
This show is

01:19:09.381 --> 01:19:10.529
