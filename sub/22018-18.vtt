WEBVTT

00:01.835 --> 00:03.554
I just got an e-mail from the school.

00:03.601 --> 00:06.773
Crossing Guard Sandy
is having a "hip replacement."

00:06.836 --> 00:09.537
Mama, I know this means rehab.

00:09.606 --> 00:12.106
Aww. My little girl is growing up.

00:12.175 --> 00:13.508
Principal Ablin needs

00:13.576 --> 00:15.376
parent volunteers to fill in for her.

00:15.445 --> 00:16.844
Oh, my God, Mom. Please don't.

00:16.913 --> 00:18.146
Don't you know your own mother?

00:18.214 --> 00:19.947
For me, "volunteering"
is in the same category

00:20.016 --> 00:21.816
as cardio and quinoa.

00:21.885 --> 00:24.118
But you did volunteer to run
the Spring Gala.

00:24.187 --> 00:27.188
Only to endear myself to
all those idiot moms I hate.

00:27.257 --> 00:28.556
Have you nailed down a venue yet?

00:28.625 --> 00:32.927
So far, my only options
are the YMCA and...

00:32.996 --> 00:34.328
that's it.

00:34.397 --> 00:36.364
I was hoping something was going
to come to me in that pause,

00:36.433 --> 00:37.732
but nothing showed up.

00:37.801 --> 00:39.734
I'm really starting to worry
about finding a venue.

00:39.803 --> 00:42.437
I know my archenemies are
just waiting for me to fail.

00:42.505 --> 00:43.704
Okay, Batman.

00:43.773 --> 00:45.540
How many archenemies are you up to?

00:45.608 --> 00:47.942
Eight archenemies, three nemesises...

00:48.011 --> 00:50.211
Nemeses.

00:50.280 --> 00:51.813
Nemeses.

00:51.881 --> 00:53.948
And one more mom that
just started to turn on me.

00:54.017 --> 00:55.716
She told me her daughter's name
was Poet.

00:55.785 --> 00:57.218
What am I supposed to do? Not laugh?

00:57.287 --> 00:59.153
Know your audience, Poet's mom!

00:59.222 --> 01:01.756
You know, you should really
look at the Carson House.

01:01.825 --> 01:04.325
It's a huge estate...
gardens, room for dancing,

01:04.394 --> 01:06.294
and, on a historical note,
the outhouse is still there

01:06.362 --> 01:09.597
where Paul Revere took a rush
number two on his midnight ride.

01:09.666 --> 01:11.265
- There's a plaque.
- Hmm.

01:11.334 --> 01:12.433
The Carson House is under the domain

01:12.502 --> 01:13.434
of the Historical Guild.

01:13.503 --> 01:14.902
And as Guild recording secretary,

01:14.955 --> 01:16.844
Stan was in charge
of all rental inquiries.

01:16.907 --> 01:19.907
Hmm. I thought Stan moved
to Nepal to "find himself."

01:19.976 --> 01:21.442
Oh, rehab!

01:21.511 --> 01:22.577
If I do air quotes twice,

01:22.645 --> 01:24.278
it means "flee from bad marriage."

01:24.347 --> 01:26.581
Yes, but his seat was
taken over by his wife,

01:26.649 --> 01:27.982
so that means you're gonna need

01:28.051 --> 01:29.717
to get Chloe Brown Mueller
to sign off on it.

01:29.786 --> 01:31.118
Ugh! Chloe Brown Mueller?

01:31.187 --> 01:32.553
She is never gonna say yes to me.

01:32.622 --> 01:34.255
She's like my number-one archenemy.

01:34.324 --> 01:36.657
The Joker doesn't rent
Arkham Asylum out to Batman

01:36.726 --> 01:37.658
for his bat-parties.

01:37.727 --> 01:39.026
No, he does not.

01:39.095 --> 01:40.595
I need to find someone irresistible

01:40.663 --> 01:42.597
to do my bidding.

01:42.665 --> 01:44.632
Aren't you adorable?

01:44.701 --> 01:45.833
Thank you.

01:45.902 --> 01:47.735
Can I speak to Chloe Brown Mueller?

01:47.804 --> 01:49.051
She's eating her lunch right now,

01:49.129 --> 01:50.671
- and she doesn't like to be...
- Maria, who is that?!

01:50.740 --> 01:52.273
I told you to never reveal details

01:52.342 --> 01:53.641
about my private life.

01:53.710 --> 01:55.309
Ugh, I forgot after I haven't

01:55.378 --> 01:56.611
seen you in a while how rough you look.

01:56.679 --> 01:57.778
Get out of here.

01:57.847 --> 02:00.014
Oh, hi, Anna-Kat. How can I help you?

02:00.083 --> 02:02.383
Okay, first,

02:02.452 --> 02:04.752
you need to compliment the store.

02:04.821 --> 02:07.121
What beautiful wares you have here.

02:07.190 --> 02:08.622
Finally,

02:08.691 --> 02:11.485
someone with a good eye for wares.

02:13.997 --> 02:17.598
Then you need to say something
nice about Chloe's looks.

02:17.667 --> 02:19.433
I love that haircut.

02:19.502 --> 02:21.168
It frames your face perfectly.

02:21.237 --> 02:24.238
And makes my cheekbones look
like Keith Urban's.

02:24.307 --> 02:27.008
It does.

02:27.076 --> 02:30.011
Then take a random shot at Maria.

02:30.079 --> 02:33.180
Maria, there is such a thing
as teeth-whitening strips.

02:33.249 --> 02:35.383
Good one, Anna-Kat!

02:35.451 --> 02:37.018
Up top.

02:38.688 --> 02:41.155
Once the table's set...

02:41.224 --> 02:43.991
then you make the ask.

02:44.060 --> 02:45.526
Oh, I was wondering.

02:45.595 --> 02:47.295
Can my mom please use the Carson House

02:47.363 --> 02:48.496
for the Spring Gala?

02:48.565 --> 02:51.532
Aww. You tell your mama
that I hate her guts

02:51.601 --> 02:53.067
and then laugh at her like this.

02:54.637 --> 02:56.203
She hates your guts.

03:01.277 --> 03:04.211
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx
<font color="#0080ff">www.</font>addic7ed<font color="#0080ff">.com</font>

03:06.282 --> 03:09.584
I need that venue.

03:09.652 --> 03:12.553
Of all people, it had to be
Chloe Brown Mueller.

03:12.622 --> 03:13.955
Well, you got to come up with something.

03:14.023 --> 03:15.122
The Gala's just two months away.

03:15.191 --> 03:16.424
Can you stop screaming at me?

03:16.492 --> 03:17.558
I'm not screaming at you.

03:17.627 --> 03:18.893
You're totally screaming. Doris?

03:18.962 --> 03:20.194
- Yeah, you're making a scene.
- Mm-hmm.

03:20.263 --> 03:21.462
Ugh, I hate it when you guys do that

03:21.531 --> 03:23.130
"You're screaming" thing
when I'm not screaming.

03:23.199 --> 03:24.532
It drives me crazy!

03:24.601 --> 03:25.591
Okay. Now you're screaming.

03:25.607 --> 03:28.174
You sent in a child
to do an assassin's work.

03:28.243 --> 03:31.411
Why not have Angela go
full-on lawyer on Chloe's ass?

03:31.480 --> 03:32.612
Rough her up a bit.

03:32.681 --> 03:34.114
I have her threaten people all the time.

03:34.182 --> 03:35.949
What's that word you use
to intimidate people?

03:36.017 --> 03:37.717
- It sounds dirty?
- Penal code?

03:37.786 --> 03:38.985
- That's the one.
- Yeah.

03:39.054 --> 03:40.253
Do you really think

03:40.322 --> 03:42.455
that you can intimidate
Chloe Brown Mueller?

03:42.524 --> 03:45.058
I could do it in my sleep.

03:45.127 --> 03:47.861
I checked the deed on your shop

03:47.929 --> 03:49.162
and there are some issues.

03:49.231 --> 03:50.697
You have an easement running
through your property.

03:50.766 --> 03:52.999
Also, a problem with
your grantor-grantee index.

03:53.052 --> 03:54.371
And no permit for the add-on

03:54.440 --> 03:55.906
that encroaches on city property.

03:55.975 --> 03:58.275
That's bad.

03:58.344 --> 03:59.510
Wow!

03:59.579 --> 04:01.745
Could you intimidate
the guy at Yogurtland?

04:01.814 --> 04:04.114
He keeps calling me out
for putting on extra toppings

04:04.183 --> 04:06.317
after he's already weighed it.

04:09.889 --> 04:11.956
Right this way. There we go.

04:12.024 --> 04:15.125
- Oh, my God.
- My dad is filling in for Sandy.

04:15.194 --> 04:16.427
Go ahead.

04:16.495 --> 04:18.228
Are you upset because
he's the crossing guard

04:18.297 --> 04:20.498
or because he's wearing a lady's vest?

04:20.565 --> 04:21.899
Remember last year when we did

04:21.968 --> 04:24.034
the count-to-three rule
before you speak?

04:24.103 --> 04:25.836
- It's back.
- Safety first.

04:25.905 --> 04:26.904
Oh, no.

04:26.973 --> 04:28.439
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

04:28.508 --> 04:30.641
Okay. Come on.

04:30.710 --> 04:32.543
Hello, everybody. Hi.

04:32.612 --> 04:34.111
Why is he doing this to us?!

04:34.180 --> 04:35.546
What? It's not that bad.

04:35.615 --> 04:37.548
Imagine if it was your dad out there.

04:40.553 --> 04:42.820
Why did you make me do that?

04:42.889 --> 04:44.722
Has your dad ever been
a crossing guard before?

04:44.790 --> 04:45.489
Never.

04:45.558 --> 04:46.957
He's a natural.

04:47.026 --> 04:49.493
In all my years as an educator,
I've never seen his equal.

04:49.562 --> 04:51.095
Here we go.

04:51.163 --> 04:52.730
My lord, he ZZ Top'd it.

04:54.367 --> 04:55.900
We have to put an end to this.

04:58.271 --> 04:59.403
Hey.

04:59.472 --> 05:00.571
What do you think you're doing?

05:00.640 --> 05:01.872
Chipping in,
giving back to the community.

05:01.941 --> 05:03.741
- Well, knock it off.
- Yeah, you're embarrassing us.

05:03.809 --> 05:05.509
Hey, the school needed
someone to help out,

05:05.578 --> 05:07.745
my work schedule allowed for it,
so I stepped up.

05:07.813 --> 05:08.946
Besides, it's good for you

05:09.015 --> 05:10.347
to be embarrassed every once in a while.

05:10.416 --> 05:11.315
Builds character.

05:11.384 --> 05:12.750
Just gimme the sign, Greg.

05:17.957 --> 05:19.590
Is the baby sleeping
through the night yet?

05:19.659 --> 05:21.892
You'd have to ask the night nurse.

05:21.961 --> 05:23.961
I put on a sleep mask, pop two Ambien,

05:24.030 --> 05:26.063
and, just to be safe,
I crash in the pool house.

05:26.132 --> 05:29.199
Sometimes, I don't wake up
until it's time to come here.

05:29.268 --> 05:31.302
Hey.

05:31.370 --> 05:33.938
So, did you get Chloe Brown
Mueller to bend to your will?

05:34.006 --> 05:35.306
I went over to her shop to talk to her,

05:35.374 --> 05:36.440
you know, play hardball?

05:36.509 --> 05:38.175
The thing is, she played
hardball right back.

05:38.244 --> 05:39.743
But you know what? I don't give in.

05:39.812 --> 05:40.978
And she didn't, either,

05:41.047 --> 05:43.547
and, well, one thing led to another.

05:43.616 --> 05:45.015
What thing led to what other thing?

05:47.000 --> 05:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:59.565 --> 06:02.633
Maria, you're not on break! Clean it up!

06:07.540 --> 06:09.640
Are you being serious right now?

06:09.709 --> 06:12.042
You hooked up with Chloe Brown Mueller?

06:12.111 --> 06:13.510
In front of Maria?

06:13.579 --> 06:15.713
No, we just pre-gamed at the shop.

06:15.781 --> 06:17.548
We ended back up at my place.

06:17.617 --> 06:18.549
You know how you're always telling us

06:18.618 --> 06:20.184
how selfish she is?

06:20.252 --> 06:22.753
That was not my experience.

06:22.822 --> 06:24.488
Oh, my God.

06:24.557 --> 06:25.589
I want to know nothing

06:25.658 --> 06:27.091
and everything at the same time.

06:27.159 --> 06:28.459
I can't believe

06:28.527 --> 06:30.661
you hooked up with Chloe Brown Mueller.

06:30.730 --> 06:31.762
How does that even happen?!

06:31.831 --> 06:32.963
Easy.

06:33.032 --> 06:34.832
She's a lonely Westport
housewife in crisis.

06:34.900 --> 06:35.966
It's kind of my bread and butter.

06:36.035 --> 06:37.234
I'm glad you got your bread buttered,

06:37.303 --> 06:38.802
but did you get the contract signed?

06:38.871 --> 06:40.471
Oh, yeah. That's why I was there.

06:40.539 --> 06:41.673
I forgot that part.

06:47.791 --> 06:49.938
Angela, I sent you to rough her up

06:50.002 --> 06:51.344
and get the contract signed.

06:51.394 --> 06:53.127
Well, I did the first part.

06:53.196 --> 06:55.149
So, are you guys gonna be,
like, an item now?

06:55.212 --> 06:56.978
No. Chloe and I both know

06:57.047 --> 06:58.313
it was a one-and-done thing.

06:58.382 --> 07:00.415
I'm only asking because here she comes.

07:00.484 --> 07:01.816
- Hi!
- Oh, my God.

07:01.885 --> 07:03.685
She stole my Tegan and Sara sweatshirt.

07:03.754 --> 07:05.720
I feel like something magical
is about to happen.

07:05.789 --> 07:08.890
I thought you might be here
with your little breakfast club.

07:08.959 --> 07:11.126
Oh, please! You have to sit here!

07:11.194 --> 07:12.727
Oh, thank you so much.

07:12.796 --> 07:14.614
I've worked up quite an appetite.

07:14.638 --> 07:15.997
Oh.

07:15.999 --> 07:18.133
So, did you tell them about us?

07:18.201 --> 07:20.001
Oh, she told us everything.

07:20.070 --> 07:22.704
And I just want to say,
you both look so good together.

07:22.773 --> 07:24.839
Seriously. You both are glowing.

07:24.908 --> 07:26.007
Aren't they glowing, Katie?

07:26.076 --> 07:28.243
It's hideous... yet I can't look away.

07:28.311 --> 07:30.445
- Listen, Chloe.
- Yes, Angie?

07:30.514 --> 07:32.914
Angers? Angela!

07:32.983 --> 07:34.616
I'm just trying out a few nicknames...

07:34.684 --> 07:35.683
- Uh-huh.
- ...and I'll find it.

07:35.752 --> 07:36.951
Just like you found it...

07:37.020 --> 07:38.086
- Mm.
- ...last night.

07:38.155 --> 07:39.120
Okay, well, listen.

07:39.189 --> 07:40.355
Can you sign this contract

07:40.424 --> 07:42.290
saying that Katie can use
the Carson House

07:42.359 --> 07:43.525
for the Spring Gala?

07:43.593 --> 07:45.160
You know, normally,

07:45.228 --> 07:47.662
I would tell Katie
how much I deeply hate her

07:47.731 --> 07:50.231
and then I'd make some quip
about how her house

07:50.300 --> 07:52.033
could be brought to school as a diorama

07:52.102 --> 07:53.401
because it's a shoe box.

07:53.470 --> 07:55.570
But this morning... I don't know...

07:55.639 --> 07:57.305
I'm feeling good.

07:57.374 --> 07:59.240
Might have something to do with...

07:59.309 --> 08:01.109
how you made me feel good last night.

08:01.178 --> 08:02.510
Okay. Yep, we know.

08:02.579 --> 08:04.245
You two are so cute!

08:04.314 --> 08:06.815
But the thing is,

08:06.883 --> 08:10.051
I have to scan the contract
and e-mail it for Stan to sign.

08:10.120 --> 08:11.419
Wait, you can't sign it?

08:11.488 --> 08:13.388
No, but I'll hear from him
as soon as he wanders

08:13.457 --> 08:15.390
into one of those Internet cafes.

08:15.459 --> 08:16.591
How long will that take?

08:16.660 --> 08:17.826
Could be weeks.

08:17.894 --> 08:18.927
You know what?

08:18.995 --> 08:20.428
I'm gonna go buy something sweet...

08:20.497 --> 08:22.263
- for my sweet.
- Mm.

08:22.332 --> 08:23.631
Okay... Oh. That happened.

08:23.700 --> 08:24.632
Don't miss me too much.

08:24.701 --> 08:26.501
All right.

08:26.570 --> 08:29.170
Katie, I cannot deal with
a stage-five hetero clinger.

08:29.239 --> 08:31.005
- I'm out.
- What? No!

08:31.074 --> 08:32.440
Angela, you have to stay with her

08:32.509 --> 08:34.008
until Chloe gets the contract signed.

08:34.077 --> 08:35.342
I really need this venue.

08:35.412 --> 08:36.678
And I'm having fun!

08:36.746 --> 08:38.413
- She said it could be weeks.
- Suck it up.

08:38.482 --> 08:41.015
I have to sleep with Richard
until I'm 50.

08:41.083 --> 08:42.517
- Why 50?
- It was in the prenup.

08:42.586 --> 08:44.164
Also I'm only allowed to gain 15 pounds.

08:44.210 --> 08:47.111
Angela, please.
I really need this venue.

08:47.165 --> 08:48.131
Fine.

08:48.199 --> 08:50.833
Oh, God. Thank you.

08:50.902 --> 08:53.836
A chocolate angel
for my chocolate angel.

08:53.905 --> 08:55.037
Ooh.

08:55.106 --> 08:57.206
I am so glad I woke up for this.

08:57.275 --> 08:58.708
Mm-hmm.

09:05.583 --> 09:07.250
Oh, my God. He bought a whistle.

09:08.386 --> 09:10.753
Not all heroes wear capes.

09:12.724 --> 09:14.357
Oh, Harriet.

09:14.426 --> 09:16.259
Let me help you with that backpack.

09:16.327 --> 09:17.927
Whoa, is this a crosswalk or a catwalk?

09:17.996 --> 09:19.862
Those are some great-fitting
jeans there, Steve.

09:19.931 --> 09:22.465
- Mr. Otto.
- Gayle, what do you got?

09:22.534 --> 09:25.234
Ow!

09:25.303 --> 09:27.170
Franklin!

09:29.040 --> 09:30.440
Kid, are you okay?

09:30.508 --> 09:31.707
I think so.

09:31.776 --> 09:33.643
I wish there was somebody there
to stop me.

09:33.711 --> 09:35.978
Oh, my God. Franklin,
you have to be more careful.

09:36.047 --> 09:38.414
You need to stop
victimshaming me, Mr. Otto.

09:38.483 --> 09:39.482
We'll take him to the nurse, Dad.

09:39.551 --> 09:41.217
- I think he'll be fine.
- Okay.

09:41.286 --> 09:42.985
Here.

09:45.690 --> 09:47.023
Good acting, Franklin.

09:47.091 --> 09:48.391
Thanks.

09:48.460 --> 09:50.860
I've been hit by cars multiple times.

09:50.929 --> 09:52.495
I'm gonna need your vest, Otto.

09:58.436 --> 09:59.936
And your gun.

10:00.004 --> 10:01.604
You didn't give me a gun.

10:01.673 --> 10:03.473
Oh, good. That's good.

10:11.316 --> 10:13.015
- Chloe?
- Hi, guys.

10:13.084 --> 10:15.351
Welcome to Angela's. Come on in.

10:15.420 --> 10:16.352
Shoes off!

10:16.421 --> 10:17.887
I'm gonna go grab some wine.

10:17.956 --> 10:19.188
Okay.

10:19.257 --> 10:21.757
Why did you invite us over here
if she's here?

10:21.826 --> 10:23.860
Oh, I invited you here
because she's here.

10:23.928 --> 10:25.461
You two are my buffers.

10:25.530 --> 10:27.797
Hey, honey. Where's the corkscrew?

10:27.866 --> 10:29.365
It's in the drawer by the stove.

10:29.434 --> 10:30.967
Oh, we are changing that.

10:31.035 --> 10:32.702
I can't be around her by myself.

10:32.770 --> 10:34.370
What makes you think
she wants to be around me?

10:34.439 --> 10:35.371
She hates me.

10:35.440 --> 10:36.472
Then if you want that venue,

10:36.541 --> 10:37.740
you need to find a way to change that.

10:37.809 --> 10:39.041
Make nice with her.

10:39.110 --> 10:41.177
Ooh, Katie kissing up
to Chloe Brown Mueller!

10:41.246 --> 10:42.712
That sounds like a fun show, too.

10:42.780 --> 10:44.247
I'm back!

10:44.315 --> 10:45.681
Oh. Great.

10:47.385 --> 10:50.186
Did you miss me? 'Cause I missed you.

10:50.255 --> 10:51.654
- Um...
- I did.

10:51.723 --> 10:52.588
Shut up, Katie.

10:52.657 --> 10:54.757
Chloe, listen.

10:54.826 --> 10:58.227
- You make my best friend very happy.
- Aww.

10:58.296 --> 11:00.763
And I was thinking that
it would be for the best

11:00.832 --> 11:03.566
if you and I mended our fences.

11:03.635 --> 11:06.135
I couldn't agree more.

11:06.204 --> 11:08.738
- I've hated you for so long...
- Mm-hmm.

11:08.806 --> 11:10.339
...and I started thinking about it.

11:10.408 --> 11:12.441
Why do I hate you so much?

11:12.510 --> 11:13.910
Is it because you're poor,

11:13.978 --> 11:16.145
because you're tragically sloppy,

11:16.214 --> 11:18.548
or maybe it's those wide hobbit feet?

11:18.616 --> 11:20.516
- Mm-hmm.
- And the answer is yes.

11:20.585 --> 11:22.552
It's all those things.

11:22.620 --> 11:24.687
And you act like you hate me,

11:24.756 --> 11:28.491
but what's really going on
is you hate yourself.

11:28.560 --> 11:30.927
Yeah, it's just my general appearance

11:30.995 --> 11:32.995
that has been a real barrier between us.

11:33.064 --> 11:35.331
But if we're gonna spend time together,

11:35.400 --> 11:37.166
I'm gonna introduce you
to something called

11:37.235 --> 11:38.601
a "drink coaster."

11:38.670 --> 11:40.770
'Cause I can't have those foam
beer sleeves

11:40.838 --> 11:42.672
just laying around my house.

11:42.740 --> 11:43.773
All right, I'm gonna grab some dessert.

11:43.841 --> 11:46.075
- Yeah, you do that.
- Okay.

11:46.144 --> 11:47.710
I'm clay! Mold me.

11:47.779 --> 11:48.911
All right!

11:48.980 --> 11:50.980
I can't do this. Screw the Carson House.

11:51.049 --> 11:52.281
I'll just do it at the YMCA

11:52.350 --> 11:53.916
and tell the intramural
basketball league

11:53.985 --> 11:55.885
that they can only have half
the court that night.

11:55.954 --> 11:57.553
Who's ready for some dessert?

11:57.622 --> 11:59.221
Oh.

11:59.290 --> 12:00.890
Thank you.

12:00.959 --> 12:03.092
Oh, give me two scoops of that.

12:03.161 --> 12:04.794
Okay.

12:04.862 --> 12:06.862
I never want this day to end.

12:06.931 --> 12:09.532
Here you go. Now, this isn't for you.

12:09.601 --> 12:11.434
This is to teach you some willpower.

12:11.502 --> 12:13.302
- Okay, Chloe...
- Oh, you know what?

12:13.371 --> 12:14.337
While I was in the kitchen,

12:14.405 --> 12:16.739
Stan e-mailed me back the contract.

12:16.808 --> 12:17.840
He signed it.

12:17.909 --> 12:18.874
Where is it?

12:18.943 --> 12:20.176
Oh, I just have to print it out.

12:20.244 --> 12:21.844
I don't want to waste
another precious moment

12:21.913 --> 12:23.112
of your alone time with Angela.

12:23.181 --> 12:24.747
E-mail it to me,
and I'll print it at home.

12:24.816 --> 12:25.982
No problem.

12:26.050 --> 12:27.917
You and Chocolate Angel
have a nice night!

12:27.986 --> 12:29.185
I'm coming with!

12:29.253 --> 12:31.087
Okay. Ooh, yeah.

12:31.155 --> 12:32.521
Don't leave me.

12:32.590 --> 12:33.889
I can't take another moment with her.

12:33.958 --> 12:35.625
- Mnh.
- Ha ha.

12:37.428 --> 12:40.429
So, should we retire to the bedroom?

12:41.833 --> 12:42.832
Might as well.

12:47.038 --> 12:49.505
I've got the signed document from Stan.

12:49.574 --> 12:51.874
The Carson House is officially mine.

12:51.943 --> 12:53.109
Congratulations.

12:53.177 --> 12:54.510
At least you can show your face
at school.

12:54.579 --> 12:56.045
No one got mowed down on your watch.

12:56.114 --> 12:57.546
Try to think of all the kids

12:57.615 --> 12:59.548
who didn't get mowed down on your watch.

12:59.617 --> 13:00.683
You don't get it.

13:00.752 --> 13:02.418
You've never been a man of the vest.

13:03.454 --> 13:04.520
I should've been better.

13:06.190 --> 13:07.456
Wow.

13:07.525 --> 13:08.924
Dad is really taking this hard.

13:08.993 --> 13:11.327
Did we do the right thing?

13:11.396 --> 13:13.562
Hey, you two. We did this for a reason.

13:13.631 --> 13:15.831
You want Dad out there in that sash

13:15.900 --> 13:18.100
representing this family?

13:18.169 --> 13:19.301
Smarten up.

13:19.370 --> 13:20.269
Anna-Kat, we were...

13:20.338 --> 13:21.437
- Smarten up.
- But we...

13:21.506 --> 13:22.638
Smarten up!

13:28.579 --> 13:31.614
<i>I got the venue,
and Chloe's out of my life.</i>

13:31.683 --> 13:34.050
<i>Now all I need to do is
run away to Mexico</i>

13:34.118 --> 13:36.819
<i>and everything will be perfect.</i>

13:36.888 --> 13:38.954
<i>Gotta really throw this away.</i>

13:39.023 --> 13:42.091
<i>Nah. I'll save it just in case.</i>

13:46.931 --> 13:48.597
Chloe?

13:48.666 --> 13:50.433
What are you doing here?

13:50.501 --> 13:51.767
And crying?

13:51.836 --> 13:53.836
Angela broke up with me!

13:55.506 --> 13:58.941
Oh, my God.

13:59.010 --> 14:02.745
- Cradle me like a baby bird.
- No.

14:02.814 --> 14:04.413
My wing is broken.

14:04.482 --> 14:07.083
Oh, God! Your earrings are ugly!

14:12.086 --> 14:14.353
I don't understand what I did wrong.

14:14.422 --> 14:16.271
I mean, you know her better
than anybody.

14:16.325 --> 14:17.747
Did she say anything to you?

14:17.818 --> 14:20.841
The connection we had was so powerful.

14:20.896 --> 14:22.354
Why are you here?

14:22.423 --> 14:24.485
You must have plenty of friends
to talk to.

14:24.532 --> 14:25.865
I don't.

14:25.934 --> 14:27.366
I mean, I have my...

14:27.435 --> 14:29.836
hundreds of thousands
of Instagram followers,

14:29.904 --> 14:31.504
but they aren't really friends.

14:31.573 --> 14:32.872
And then there's Maria,

14:32.941 --> 14:34.640
but she keeps changing her phone number.

14:34.709 --> 14:37.443
She said that the phone company
has to do that every month,

14:37.512 --> 14:39.245
but that doesn't make sense.

14:39.314 --> 14:42.582
Well, that is so sad.

14:42.650 --> 14:44.772
You know the best thing for that is?

14:44.812 --> 14:45.811
A warm hug?

14:45.879 --> 14:47.179
No.

14:47.248 --> 14:48.847
Drinking by yourself

14:48.916 --> 14:51.183
at your own home.

14:51.252 --> 14:52.284
I'm so alone.

14:52.353 --> 14:53.252
No, you're not.

14:53.320 --> 14:55.087
I'm here for you...

14:55.155 --> 14:56.822
- in spirit.
- Wait, I...

15:06.400 --> 15:08.033
Greg, honey.

15:08.102 --> 15:10.068
I know you're upset about the incident,

15:10.137 --> 15:12.838
but you are a great parent.

15:12.906 --> 15:14.473
Our kids are lucky to have you.

15:14.541 --> 15:16.608
That school is lucky to have you.

15:16.677 --> 15:19.378
And besides, even if you
had hurt that boy,

15:19.446 --> 15:21.079
- it's Franklin.
- Thanks, honey.

15:21.148 --> 15:23.148
I'm gonna go watch videos
of three-legged dogs.

15:23.217 --> 15:25.284
Their can-do spirit really cheers me up.

15:25.352 --> 15:26.718
But first, I'll play myself out.

15:31.158 --> 15:32.791
- Mom?
- Mm-hmm?

15:32.860 --> 15:34.826
We might have had something to do

15:34.895 --> 15:37.262
with Dad losing his position
as a crossing guard.

15:38.465 --> 15:39.931
They made me go along with it.

15:40.000 --> 15:40.999
It was your idea!

15:41.068 --> 15:42.234
And it was a damn good one.

15:42.303 --> 15:44.236
Guys, I am so disappointed in you.

15:44.305 --> 15:46.638
I know that you didn't like Dad
filling in as crossing guard,

15:46.707 --> 15:49.308
but sometimes, even though
it's not good for you,

15:49.376 --> 15:51.843
you have to do what's good
for someone else.

15:53.280 --> 15:54.446
Damn.

15:54.515 --> 15:56.481
I just said something
that applies to me.

15:56.550 --> 15:57.983
You guys are going to have to find a way

15:58.052 --> 16:00.085
to make this up to your father.

16:00.154 --> 16:02.454
And I've got to go to
Chloe Brown Mueller's house.

16:04.325 --> 16:05.624
I don't know how to play the piano.

16:13.667 --> 16:15.334
Why?!

16:15.402 --> 16:16.868
Chloe?

16:16.937 --> 16:19.805
Oh. Oh, hey.

16:19.873 --> 16:22.207
Okay. Talk to me.

16:22.276 --> 16:24.643
I'm here... for you.

16:24.712 --> 16:26.712
I don't know what I was doing
with Angela.

16:26.780 --> 16:28.680
My life used to be perfect,

16:28.749 --> 16:30.816
and now everything's upside down.

16:30.884 --> 16:32.851
- Within months, I'm single.
- Mm-hmm.

16:32.920 --> 16:34.119
- I'm dating women.
- Mm-hmm.

16:34.188 --> 16:36.922
And now, here I am,
with no one else to turn to,

16:36.990 --> 16:39.324
except you, my nemesis.

16:39.393 --> 16:40.926
- Nemeses.
- That's plural.

16:40.994 --> 16:42.227
Oh, I thought I had it.

16:42.296 --> 16:43.261
Look, Chloe.

16:43.330 --> 16:45.130
You've just hit a rough patch,

16:45.199 --> 16:46.631
but you have so much...

16:46.700 --> 16:49.267
a house, a kid, your shop.

16:49.336 --> 16:53.105
And a sexual future that is,
frankly, uncharted.

16:53.173 --> 16:54.873
You just doubled your dating pool!

16:54.942 --> 16:56.742
No, but nobody wants me.

16:56.810 --> 17:00.145
My husband left.
I screwed things up with Angela.

17:00.214 --> 17:02.013
I mean, the only relationship
I haven't failed at

17:02.082 --> 17:03.749
is with my cosmetic dentist.

17:03.817 --> 17:05.983
See?

17:06.053 --> 17:08.019
You didn't screw things up with Angela.

17:08.088 --> 17:10.155
She was really into you the first night.

17:10.223 --> 17:12.057
That's just what she does...
She's a one-and-done.

17:12.126 --> 17:14.526
Well, not with me. We were 19-and-done.

17:14.595 --> 17:15.594
That's my fault.

17:15.662 --> 17:17.496
I wanted you to sign the papers,

17:17.564 --> 17:18.997
so I forced Angela to stay with you.

17:19.066 --> 17:20.398
The last 18 were on me.

17:20.467 --> 17:23.135
Wait. So it wasn't my fault?

17:23.203 --> 17:26.070
It was her fault and yours.

17:26.140 --> 17:27.705
Yes.

17:27.775 --> 17:30.475
That actually makes me feel
a little better.

17:30.544 --> 17:32.144
If you think about it,

17:32.212 --> 17:34.780
I just did you a favor by telling you.

17:34.848 --> 17:37.115
So... maybe you could do me a favor

17:37.184 --> 17:39.084
and let me keep the Carson House
for the Gala.

17:39.153 --> 17:40.786
I could.

17:40.854 --> 17:43.555
But instead, I'll just do this.

17:46.627 --> 17:48.260
Ya poor.

17:48.328 --> 17:50.629
Whoo! She's back, everybody!

17:50.697 --> 17:52.964
Hey! Your Gala's gonna suck!

18:02.643 --> 18:04.743
Okay, time's up.

18:04.812 --> 18:07.045
I gave you guys two days
to figure out a way

18:07.114 --> 18:09.047
to make it up to your father.

18:09.116 --> 18:11.550
We figured out something
that Dad can do at school.

18:11.618 --> 18:13.118
It will make him happy and, at least,

18:13.187 --> 18:14.986
he's not in view,
so we won't be embarrassed.

18:22.062 --> 18:23.829
<i>As a friendly reminder,</i>

18:23.897 --> 18:26.131
<i>please do not leave
fish-based sandwiches</i>

18:26.200 --> 18:28.200
<i>in your lockers overnight.</i>

18:28.268 --> 18:30.535
<i>This has been the morning announcements.</i>

18:30.604 --> 18:33.972
Before I go, I'd like
to take a minute to tell

18:34.041 --> 18:36.210
my three favorite minutemen

18:36.281 --> 18:37.421
<i>to have a great day.</i>

18:37.478 --> 18:38.810
Don't say our names.

18:38.879 --> 18:40.979
<i>My main man, Oliver Otto.</i>

18:41.048 --> 18:43.114
Oh, no. My mom must have told him.

18:43.183 --> 18:44.716
He's getting revenge.

18:44.785 --> 18:46.184
<i>Your voice changing is
just the beginning</i>

18:46.253 --> 18:48.587
<i>of your journey into manhood.</i>

18:48.655 --> 18:50.489
You got too much heat on you, man.

18:50.557 --> 18:52.858
I've gotta <i>vámonos</i>.

18:52.926 --> 18:55.227
<i>My big girl, Taylor Otto,</i>

18:55.295 --> 18:58.063
<i>who still won't let me
give away her Barbies.</i>

18:58.131 --> 19:00.499
- Not cool, Mr. A.
- He can't hear you.

19:01.902 --> 19:03.935
Not cool, Mr. A!

19:04.004 --> 19:06.104
<i>And last but not least...</i>

19:06.173 --> 19:07.339
Don't do it, Greg.

19:07.407 --> 19:09.875
<i>...my baby girl, Anna-Kat Otto.</i>

19:09.943 --> 19:12.611
<i>If anybody wants to see a slide
show of her baby pictures,</i>

19:12.679 --> 19:14.579
<i>it will be up all day in the gymnasium.</i>

19:14.648 --> 19:17.015
In all my baby pictures,
I'm wearing a helmet.

19:22.422 --> 19:24.589
Anna-Kat, you have
a huge knot under here.

19:24.658 --> 19:26.291
You can't just brush
the top of your hair.

19:26.360 --> 19:27.259
Yeah, yeah.

19:31.999 --> 19:33.064
Oh, my God.

19:33.133 --> 19:34.132
Chloe Brown Mueller says

19:34.201 --> 19:36.067
I can use the Carson House after all.

19:36.136 --> 19:37.435
That's great, Mama.

19:37.504 --> 19:39.404
Why in the world would she do that?

19:39.473 --> 19:41.373
She hates me.

19:43.877 --> 19:45.544
What did you do?

19:47.180 --> 19:48.847
- Ow.
- His ankle!

19:48.916 --> 19:50.882
Oh, what happened?

19:50.951 --> 19:52.584
He tripped over your rug.

19:52.653 --> 19:54.185
It wasn't properly secured.

19:54.254 --> 19:55.420
Of course it was.

19:55.489 --> 19:57.556
Maria! Tell them the rug
was properly secured!

19:57.624 --> 19:59.925
I don't own this place.

19:59.993 --> 20:03.428
His father is a judge.
This is not good for you.

20:03.497 --> 20:07.365
How are we going to make this go away?

20:07.434 --> 20:09.868
You little...

20:09.937 --> 20:12.270
She hates me.

20:12.339 --> 20:14.940
I'm raising myself, and I love it.

20:21.017 --> 20:23.222
Daddy's having "Daddy time."

20:23.268 --> 20:24.670
Bowel issues.

20:24.702 --> 20:25.738
Correct.

20:25.770 --> 20:28.173
Mama's gotta "run a quick errand."

20:28.207 --> 20:29.108
You're napping in your car.

20:29.141 --> 20:30.243
Yes.

20:30.276 --> 20:32.010
Taylor has a "situation."

20:32.044 --> 20:33.546
Tampon mishap.

20:33.578 --> 20:36.081
Good job, sweetie. I'm proud of you.

20:36.114 --> 20:38.451
Fake praise masking "real concern."

20:38.483 --> 20:40.273
Okay, we're done.

20:40.298 --> 20:41.453
You're cutting this off short

20:41.487 --> 20:43.710
because you think I "know too much."
