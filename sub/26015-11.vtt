I hate not using a liner.

and killed it, some people came

01:19.412 --> 01:22.165

01:22.248 --> 01:24.167
did something we haven't
seen from them and killed it.

What you decide to do,

06:14.040 --> 06:18.086
Make sure that all your

of this or something by having

07:55.892 --> 07:57.935
{\an1}a branch with a little,
you know, egret or something?

07:58.019 --> 08:01.314
- Yes, but let's just focus on
getting the sky and the bridge

08:01.397 --> 08:02.565
and this tree line done first.
- Okay.

08:02.648 --> 08:04.734
<i>The deeper we get into</i>
<i>this competition,</i>

08:04.817 --> 08:06.110

08:06.194 --> 08:08.613
because the stronger

08:09.822 --> 08:11.782
while Chris gets
everything else sketched in.

08:11.866 --> 08:15.244

08:15.328 --> 08:16.662
{\an8}They're better.
They know what they're doing.

08:16.746 --> 08:18.581
{\an8}It's a little bit tougher to
actually get people together.

08:18.664 --> 08:21.292
- We can do the sky first,
because the bridge

08:21.375 --> 08:22.543
is just a straight line across.

08:22.627 --> 08:23.794
So if we get the straight
line--

08:23.878 --> 08:25.046

No, no, no, no.

08:26.672 --> 08:28.424
{\an3}Wait, wait, no, don't [bleep]--
don't just take control.

08:28.507 --> 08:29.884
- I'm not.
- Let's all discuss--

08:29.967 --> 08:30.927
{\an1}If we do the straight line,
then Chris can start sketching

It looks like a Turk drawing.
That wasn't a compliment.

09:03.709 --> 09:05.544

it has a lot of contrast.

38:50.619 --> 38:54.331
It's dark.
- It reads more like a temple
