¶¶

00:04.438 --> 00:06.605
<i> Previously on</i> Raven's Home...

00:06.607 --> 00:08.106
I'm gonna go take you
to see your mom.

00:08.109 --> 00:09.708
Yes! Finally!

00:09.710 --> 00:11.977
I've been acting out for weeks!

00:11.979 --> 00:14.613
I've already got
my suitcase packed!

00:14.615 --> 00:15.714
I want to come home.

00:15.716 --> 00:17.049
But we're bringing
Levi to you.

00:17.051 --> 00:19.985
No, Rae, this is over.

00:19.987 --> 00:21.987
-Where's Levi?
-Oh, he got so excited,

00:21.989 --> 00:23.822
he ran up the ramp.
The kids are getting him.

00:23.824 --> 00:25.791
Why is the dock moving
away from the ship?

00:25.793 --> 00:27.893
It's not the dock
that's moving, it's us!

00:27.895 --> 00:29.728
The next stop is Miami!

00:29.730 --> 00:30.996
All:
Miami?!

00:30.998 --> 00:32.664
What are we gonna do, Rae?

00:32.665 --> 00:33.966
I mean, how are we gonna
catch up to them?

00:33.968 --> 00:35.901
-(Chelsea shrieks)
-Hold on tight, Chels!

00:35.903 --> 00:37.970
Can you do this, Raven?!
(shrieks)

00:37.972 --> 00:40.039
Of course I can!
It's for the kids!

00:40.041 --> 00:42.875
-Now stop talking
and hold down my wig!
-(both scream)

00:42.877 --> 00:44.676
(theme music playing)

00:44.678 --> 00:46.645
<i> ¶ Yo!</i>
<i> Let me tell you somethin' ¶</i>

00:46.647 --> 00:47.913
<i> ¶ Had my vision</i>
<i> all worked out ¶</i>

00:47.915 --> 00:49.815
<i> ¶ But then life</i>
<i> had other plans ¶</i>

00:49.817 --> 00:51.417
<i>¶ Tell 'em, Rae ¶</i>

00:51.418 --> 00:53.018
<i> ¶ It's crazy when things</i>
<i> turn upside down ¶</i>

00:53.020 --> 00:55.687
<i> ¶ But ya gotta get up</i>
<i> and take that chance ¶</i>

00:55.689 --> 00:58.023
<i> -¶ Maybe I'm</i>
<i> just finding my way ¶</i>
<i> -¶ Learning how to fly ¶</i>

00:58.025 --> 01:00.659
<i> -¶ Yeah, we're gonna be okay ¶</i>
<i> -¶ Ya know I got you, right? ¶</i>

01:00.661 --> 01:02.928
<i> ¶ It might be wild, but ya</i>
<i> know that we make it work ¶</i>

01:02.930 --> 01:05.063
<i> ¶ We're just kids</i>
<i> caught up in a crazy world ¶</i>

01:05.066 --> 01:06.832
-¶<i> Come on</i> ¶
<i> -¶ It's</i> Raven's Home ¶

01:06.834 --> 01:09.034
<i> -¶ We get loud! ¶</i>
<i> -¶ It's</i> Raven's Home ¶

01:09.036 --> 01:10.736
<i> ¶ It's our crowd! ¶</i>

01:10.738 --> 01:13.072
<i> ¶ Might be tough,</i>
<i> but together</i>
<i> we make it look good ¶</i>

01:13.074 --> 01:15.707
<i> ¶ Down for each other</i>
<i> like family should ¶</i>

01:15.709 --> 01:17.042
<i> ¶ It's</i> Raven's Home ¶

01:17.044 --> 01:18.944
<i> -¶ When it's tough ¶</i>
<i> -¶ It's</i> Raven's Home ¶

01:18.946 --> 01:20.712
<i> ¶ We got love ¶</i>

01:20.714 --> 01:22.881
<i> ¶ 'Cause no matter the weather,</i>
<i> ya know we gon' shine ¶</i>

01:22.883 --> 01:25.751
<i> ¶ There for each other,</i>
<i> ya know it's our time ¶</i>

01:25.753 --> 01:26.919
(Raven laughs)

01:26.921 --> 01:28.754
Yep! That's us.

01:32.760 --> 01:35.127
¶ ¶

01:35.129 --> 01:37.096
(horn blows)

01:37.098 --> 01:39.765
Oh, we're getting
closer and closer, Rae!

01:39.767 --> 01:40.933
(Chelsea laughs)

01:40.935 --> 01:44.069
(motor sputtering)

01:44.071 --> 01:46.772
We're getting
further and further, Rae!

01:46.774 --> 01:49.775
-That's because
we stopped, Chels!
-What?!

01:54.048 --> 01:56.782
-Chelsea?
-Yeah?

01:56.784 --> 02:01.086
Did you get a Jet Ski
that had no gas in it?

02:01.088 --> 02:03.956
I got a Jet Ski
that had a key!

02:04.658 --> 02:07.159
Maybe it had a key

02:07.161 --> 02:10.829
because the gas tank was
on "E."

02:10.830 --> 02:13.065
Did you notice that, Chels?

02:13.067 --> 02:15.134
Yes, yes I did.

02:15.136 --> 02:16.935
But there are countries

02:16.937 --> 02:18.770
where you drive
on the opposite side,

02:18.772 --> 02:21.773
so you know,
maybe "E" stands for "enough."

02:21.775 --> 02:24.843
¶ ¶

02:25.813 --> 02:29.081
Booker:
Okay, this is it. Room 4002.

02:29.083 --> 02:30.983
Nia: Okay,
I will turn on a light,

02:30.985 --> 02:32.818
so we can relish
in the luxury.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.820
Booker:
Ah yeah! Okay!

02:34.822 --> 02:36.088
(Booker screams)

02:37.191 --> 02:39.858
Really? This, right here,

02:39.860 --> 02:41.793
was gonna protect us?

02:41.795 --> 02:43.962
Well, what are
we gonna do?

02:43.963 --> 02:46.130
We're on a cruise
with no adults telling us
what to do.

02:46.133 --> 02:48.967
Yo, it's like one
of those '90s movies
our parents used to watch.

02:48.969 --> 02:50.869
We're <i> Boat Alone.</i>

02:50.871 --> 02:52.838
(yelling)

02:52.840 --> 02:54.873
Let's go have
some fun, people!

02:54.875 --> 02:56.842
All right, you guys
go figure out a plan

02:56.844 --> 02:58.043
while I go get us
some food.

02:58.045 --> 02:59.945
-Okay.
-Ah yeah!

02:59.947 --> 03:01.947
This buffet's
about to get Booker'd!

03:01.949 --> 03:03.916
All:
¶ Uh-huh, uh-huh,
uh, Booker'd! ¶

03:04.885 --> 03:06.852
(rattling)

03:07.888 --> 03:09.922
-(Raven grunts)
-(Chelsea sighs)

03:11.225 --> 03:13.025
Come on, come on, Rae!

03:13.027 --> 03:15.027
Quit it! It's no use!

03:15.029 --> 03:17.829
Pushing that thing
isn't gonna start the Jet Ski!

03:17.831 --> 03:19.164
We're stuck! Oh!

03:19.166 --> 03:20.832
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

03:20.834 --> 03:22.167
Hey, maybe I can signal
to the ship from here!

03:22.169 --> 03:24.036
Hey! Hey! Hey!

03:24.038 --> 03:25.904
-No, Chelsea!
Stop it, Chelsea!
-We're stuck!

03:25.906 --> 03:28.006
-We're stuck!
-Chelsea, sit down!

03:28.008 --> 03:29.208
-(screams)
-Sit down, Chelsea!

03:29.210 --> 03:31.143
You are about to tip us over!

03:31.145 --> 03:33.178
All right?
Calm down, okay?

03:33.180 --> 03:35.981
Maybe, um...
Maybe we'll call for help.

03:35.983 --> 03:38.250
All right. Let me just, uh...
Let me just get my phone.

03:38.252 --> 03:40.152
-(Chelsea shrieks)
-Oh! Okay, okay.

03:41.989 --> 03:44.056
All right, we won't do that.
We won't do that.

03:44.058 --> 03:46.158
-How about I steady it...
-Okay.

03:46.160 --> 03:47.926
-...and you get my phone.
-All right.

03:47.928 --> 03:49.094
-Okay, you ready?
-It's in that front thing.

03:49.096 --> 03:50.896
-Just be careful, please.
-Okay.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.764
Okay. Go.

03:52.766 --> 03:54.066
I'm just gonna get over you.

03:54.068 --> 03:56.068
-Steady it. Steady!
-I'm steadying! I'm steady!

03:56.070 --> 03:59.004
-Steady! Steady! Okay!
-(Raven grunting)

03:59.006 --> 04:01.173
-Okay! All right!
-No. Chelsea. Chelsea!

04:01.175 --> 04:03.842
-I'm getting it!
I'm almost done!
-Just be-- Just...

04:03.844 --> 04:06.178
-(both grunting)
-Chelsea: Whoa!

04:06.180 --> 04:09.281
I got it! I got it!
I got it! I got it!

04:09.283 --> 04:11.883
(both panting)

04:11.885 --> 04:13.952
Okay. All right,
I'm gonna call the cops.

04:13.954 --> 04:16.021
They still have
the same number, right?

04:17.091 --> 04:19.024
Yeah, I'm sure
they do, Chels.

04:19.026 --> 04:20.291
(keypad beeps)

04:22.129 --> 04:23.862
While you're
on that phone,

04:23.864 --> 04:26.131
why don't you tell them
that these fish look suspicious.

04:26.133 --> 04:28.300
I think one of them
just side-eyed me.

04:29.270 --> 04:32.237
Hi. Yes, I'd like
to report a missing person.

04:32.239 --> 04:34.006
Uh, people.

04:34.908 --> 04:38.210
No, no. Me and my friend,
we're missing.

04:39.213 --> 04:40.279
Calling from?

04:40.281 --> 04:42.314
Hey, Rae,
where are we calling from?

04:44.251 --> 04:47.286
A Jet Ski in the middle
of the ocean!

04:49.290 --> 04:52.991
Oh. Did you hear that? Okay.

04:52.993 --> 04:54.893
-Um, what do I see?
-What?

04:54.895 --> 04:56.161
That's funny
you should say that, actually.

04:56.163 --> 04:58.263
I see sea! (laughs)

04:58.265 --> 04:59.998
Hold on. Let me see.
(clears throat)

05:00.000 --> 05:02.267
They want to know
if we can get the number
for the Jet Ski company,

05:02.269 --> 05:04.169
because maybe
they can locate us
on their GPS.

05:04.171 --> 05:06.271
-Good idea,
good idea. Um...
-Yeah.

05:06.273 --> 05:09.107
Okay. Hold on.
I'm just gonna check
one side over here.

05:09.109 --> 05:10.976
No, it's not over there.

05:10.978 --> 05:13.345
No, I don't see it. Let me look
on the other side over here.

05:13.347 --> 05:15.314
Hold on. Hold... (yells)

05:15.316 --> 05:17.916
Okay, okay.

05:17.918 --> 05:19.151
The good news is, Rae,

05:19.153 --> 05:21.186
I found the number
of the Jet Ski company.

05:21.188 --> 05:23.355
-The bad news--
-I know the bad news, Chels!

05:26.327 --> 05:28.093
I'm back!

05:28.095 --> 05:29.995
(cheering)

05:29.997 --> 05:32.964
Did you know, there are
three buffets on every deck?

05:32.966 --> 05:34.266
Well, there are. Eat up!

05:34.268 --> 05:36.301
-We got eight more to go.
-Okay.

05:36.303 --> 05:38.103
Awesome!

05:38.105 --> 05:40.305
Now, I was meant
to live a life of leisure.

05:40.307 --> 05:43.208
Hey, this food is
awesome and all,

05:43.210 --> 05:46.144
but your mom said
this cruise was a...

05:46.146 --> 05:48.180
uh, what was the word?

05:48.182 --> 05:49.314
A paradise.

05:49.316 --> 05:52.284
Yeah, didn't she say
something about a tween disco?

05:52.286 --> 05:54.052
I could be down with that.

05:54.054 --> 05:56.355
She also mentioned
games and prizes.

05:56.357 --> 05:59.224
-Now, uh,
I don't play games...
-Hmm?

05:59.226 --> 06:01.393
-...but I'm down
for some prizes.
-Okay! Okay!

06:01.395 --> 06:04.329
And I definitely saw a pool
when we were sneaking down here,

06:04.331 --> 06:08.033
and I've always wanted to float
on a giant pink flamingo.

06:08.035 --> 06:10.335
You know what I need?
I need a swimsuit.

06:10.337 --> 06:12.337
I could use some board shorts.

06:12.339 --> 06:15.006
And I could use
a surf board.

06:15.008 --> 06:17.442
(chuckles)
On a... on a cruise ship?

06:18.379 --> 06:20.011
We're unsupervised.

06:20.013 --> 06:22.080
And all we gotta do,
is show them this,

06:22.082 --> 06:24.216
and we can buy
whatever we want.

06:24.218 --> 06:28.053
This place is amazing!
You sure we're not
in heaven?

06:28.055 --> 06:31.456
Yeah, behind that door
is a combination toilet-shower.

06:31.458 --> 06:34.259
-We're not in heaven.
-(groans)

06:35.362 --> 06:37.429
Oh, Rae!
Rae, I see it.

06:37.431 --> 06:39.264
I see it,
and the light's still on,

06:39.266 --> 06:42.100
which means they still might be
able to track our location.

06:42.102 --> 06:45.337
It's right there.
Just gotta... get to it.

06:45.339 --> 06:47.372
That's not my phone,
Chels.

06:47.374 --> 06:50.075
That's the sun
reflecting off the water.

06:51.345 --> 06:53.111
Oh!

06:53.113 --> 06:56.181
Huh. Oh,
it's so beautiful.

06:56.183 --> 07:00.218
Chels, you always
manage to make the best
out of the worst situation.

07:00.220 --> 07:02.954
-Oh.
-Remember when
Devon and I broke up,

07:02.956 --> 07:05.257
you were like, uh...
(chuckles)

07:05.259 --> 07:09.027
-"More closet space for you."
-(laughs)

07:09.029 --> 07:10.262
Okay, Chels,

07:10.264 --> 07:12.030
let's live to tell
our grandkids about this.

07:12.032 --> 07:13.432
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Okay.

07:13.434 --> 07:15.300
Um, how about this?

07:15.302 --> 07:17.402
-How about we paddle...
-Okay.

07:17.404 --> 07:21.039
...with our shoes back to shore.

07:21.041 --> 07:23.241
Oh, well, I don't know
why we don't just... (grunts)

07:23.243 --> 07:27.045
...use these, uh,
emergency oars, huh?

07:27.047 --> 07:31.316
-You just... Huh?
-Chels, Chels! Those are not
emergency oars!

07:31.318 --> 07:33.084
That is a part
of the Jet Ski!

07:33.086 --> 07:35.420
You are dismantling
the one thing that's
keeping us alive!

07:35.422 --> 07:37.422
Okay, okay!

07:37.424 --> 07:41.159
All right, let me just snap
these bad boys back on.

07:41.161 --> 07:44.429
-Put them on, Chels!
-All right, they're on!

07:44.431 --> 07:46.498
¶ ¶

07:48.402 --> 07:51.069
Man, I don't know
when we'll get saved,

07:51.071 --> 07:53.405
-but I'm gonna look good
when we do.
-Yeah.

07:53.407 --> 07:56.308
(steel drum playing
Caribbean music)

08:01.181 --> 08:03.248
All right, come on, dude.
Let's go find that wave pool.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.154
Uh, Booker...
A little help here?

08:09.156 --> 08:11.189
Dude... swag.

Booker/Levi:
Yeah!

08:44.391 --> 08:46.358
-Go low, baby.
-Booker: Get it! Get it!

08:46.360 --> 08:48.226
-Go, low, baby! Yes!
-Get it! Get it!

08:48.228 --> 08:49.494
-Here we go.
-Just a little more.

Whoa!

(grunting)

08:57.304 --> 08:58.570
-Ah!
-Others: Ay!

08:58.572 --> 09:01.172
Guys, this is
so much fun.

09:01.174 --> 09:02.407
And nobody even knows
who we are.

09:02.409 --> 09:05.210
-Levi Grayson?
-I'm out.

09:05.212 --> 09:07.412
A girl's gotta do
what a girl's gotta do.

09:09.349 --> 09:11.483
You're Chelsea's son, Levi.

09:11.485 --> 09:13.552
I've seen your picture
in her phone.

09:13.554 --> 09:16.254
So. Many. Pictures.

09:16.256 --> 09:20.525
Ha. So...
Who. Are. You?

09:20.527 --> 09:23.361
I'm Bailey,
your mom's boss.

09:23.363 --> 09:25.380
I've looked
for her everywhere,

09:25.381 --> 09:27.398
and she's not returning any
of my texts or phone calls.

09:27.401 --> 09:29.234
V-rude.

09:30.170 --> 09:31.503
I have a note for your mom.

09:31.505 --> 09:34.272
Do I leave it with you
or one of your peeps?

09:34.274 --> 09:36.207
Uh, I'll take it.

09:36.209 --> 09:38.343
I've gotta set up
for my next presentation.

09:38.345 --> 09:40.612
Is that one
of my lip kitties?

09:40.614 --> 09:42.280
Tabby, put it down!

09:46.286 --> 09:48.353
-I can't believe this!
-I know!

09:48.355 --> 09:50.522
Who even uses notes anymore?

09:50.524 --> 09:52.624
No! My mom's gonna get fired

09:52.626 --> 09:55.627
by the most influential
21-year-old in the country!

09:56.563 --> 09:58.530
That's what she wrote.

10:00.300 --> 10:03.568
It also says Aunt Chelsea
has one more chance
with her seminar today.

10:03.570 --> 10:05.470
Otherwise, she's out
like Nia should have been

10:05.472 --> 10:07.672
after that
veggie platter incident.

10:09.543 --> 10:11.476
Really? That's
what the note said?

10:11.478 --> 10:14.279
Guys, we've got to save
my mom's job.

10:14.281 --> 10:15.380

10:17.651 --> 10:20.151
¶ ¶

10:20.153 --> 10:23.254
Remember that night we came up
with the Mom Commandments?

10:23.256 --> 10:25.457
(laughs)
You stood on the couch
with a staff

10:25.459 --> 10:27.158
and recited them to the kids.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.460
Yeah, I wish I had
that staff right now.

10:28.462 --> 10:30.428
I would stick it into the water,
part the ocean,

10:30.430 --> 10:32.497
and walk right to that boat!

10:33.500 --> 10:35.300
Well, that would be good.

10:35.302 --> 10:38.336
My legs are stronger
than my arms. (chuckles)

10:38.338 --> 10:40.405
That would explain
why you're not paddling.

10:41.174 --> 10:43.341
Oh!
Oh, I'm sorry!

10:43.343 --> 10:45.510
I just got so caught up
in our stories.

10:46.446 --> 10:48.413
(sighs)
Chelsea, I'm tired.

10:50.484 --> 10:52.684
You know, Rae,
one day we're gonna...

10:52.686 --> 10:55.620
we're gonna look back
on this day and laugh.

10:55.622 --> 10:57.522
Yeah, but not today.

10:59.626 --> 11:01.693
I know we're gonna
get through this, Rae.

11:02.663 --> 11:05.597
You and me can never be
defeated, huh?

11:05.599 --> 11:07.365
Mm-hmm.

11:09.536 --> 11:12.370
¶ ¶

11:16.610 --> 11:19.678
Okay, before I do
my mom's presentation,

11:19.680 --> 11:21.479
I need to get in her head.

11:21.481 --> 11:24.582
Quick, does anyone have
a red wig?

11:25.452 --> 11:27.385
Levi, you've got this.

11:27.387 --> 11:28.720
All right?
Just like we rehearsed.

11:28.722 --> 11:30.555
You're right.
Bring in the crowd.

11:31.725 --> 11:34.392
Schmop presentation!

11:34.394 --> 11:35.560
Free pizza!

11:36.363 --> 11:37.395
Free puppies!

11:37.397 --> 11:39.497
Uh, meet Chris Pratt!

11:39.499 --> 11:40.765
Meet Chris Pratt!

11:41.702 --> 11:44.636
What? He's everybody's
favorite Chris.

11:46.406 --> 11:48.406
(crowd murmuring)

11:54.681 --> 11:58.683
Ladies and gentlemen!

11:58.685 --> 12:01.519
The incomparable

12:01.521 --> 12:05.423
Chelsea... Grayson!

12:07.427 --> 12:08.693
Thank you, thank you.

12:08.695 --> 12:11.396
Welcome, everyone.
My name is Levi Grayson,

12:11.398 --> 12:14.566
the son of Schmop creator,
Chelsea Grayson.

12:14.568 --> 12:17.335
As part
of today's presentation,

12:17.337 --> 12:19.738
I'm gonna have
my lovely assistant

12:19.740 --> 12:22.774
pour food and drinks
all over the floor.

12:26.413 --> 12:29.380
Ooh, that's gonna
be a big mess.

12:29.382 --> 12:31.716
-Tess: Oh, no, don't!
-Kids: No!

12:31.718 --> 12:34.552
Nia:
Oh! That's so messy!

12:34.554 --> 12:35.720
Tess:
How are we supposed
to clean it?

12:35.722 --> 12:39.724
And now my assistant will take
his trusty Schmop

12:39.726 --> 12:43.595
and effortlessly clean up
the mess he made.

12:43.597 --> 12:46.431
Baby man, where the heck
is your mama?

12:46.433 --> 12:49.400
I got friends on board
who want their free Schmop.

12:49.402 --> 12:51.503
And since you're offering,
I want my puppy.

12:52.639 --> 12:54.706
And that fine Chris Pratt.

12:56.309 --> 12:58.476
Crowd (chanting):
Puppies, pizza, Pratt!

12:58.478 --> 13:01.613
Puppies, pizza, Pratt!
Puppies, pizza, Pratt!

(floodlight clicks)

13:14.761 --> 13:15.760
Huh?

13:15.762 --> 13:18.429
Chels, it's happened.

13:18.431 --> 13:19.497
What?

13:19.499 --> 13:21.666
The light...

13:23.804 --> 13:25.670
No! Rae!

13:25.672 --> 13:27.472
The kids!
What about our kids?!

13:27.474 --> 13:29.607
Oh, the kids! The kids!
That's right. No, mm-mm.

13:29.609 --> 13:31.876
There's no light that's going
to keep me from my kids!

13:33.346 --> 13:34.813
-MAN (over speaker): <i> Ladies!</i>
-(gasps)

13:34.815 --> 13:36.648
What? What's going on?

13:36.650 --> 13:39.584
It's the light, Chels!
It's coming to get us!
Don't go in the light!

13:39.586 --> 13:41.619
-Don't go in the light!
-I can't help it, Rae!

13:41.621 --> 13:43.454
It's so warm and welcoming.

13:43.456 --> 13:44.622
I don't want
to hear that, Chels!

13:44.624 --> 13:45.857
I got kids to see!

13:45.859 --> 13:48.726
I got kids to see, Chels,
and it's not my time!

13:50.797 --> 13:52.497
Captain:
<i> This is the Coast Guard.</i>

13:52.499 --> 13:54.532
-Both: What?
-Captain: <i> We're here</i>
<i> to save you.</i>

13:54.534 --> 13:56.367
(screaming and cheering)

13:56.369 --> 13:58.469
Oh my gosh!
Oh, it's military men, Rae!

13:58.471 --> 13:59.571
How do I look?

14:01.875 --> 14:04.542
Chels, I can't believe
that's the one thing
on your mind right now!

14:04.544 --> 14:05.877
You look like you've been
asleep on a Jet Ski

14:05.879 --> 14:07.679
for nights and nights!

14:10.851 --> 14:13.451
-Hand me that
pink mango lipstick.
-You got it.

Puppies, pizza, Pratt!

14:19.459 --> 14:20.892
Look, I love you babies,

14:20.894 --> 14:23.561
but this presentation stinks!

14:23.563 --> 14:24.729
Where's Chelsea Grayson?

14:24.731 --> 14:27.498
Hey, be patient, people!

14:27.500 --> 14:29.734
Hey, everybody,
stay in your seats!

14:29.736 --> 14:31.636
The boat's moving!

14:31.638 --> 14:33.905
Whoa, wait! She's here!

14:33.907 --> 14:35.740
-(crowd muttering)
-Woman: Will I get
my money back?

14:35.742 --> 14:38.743
My mom is right here
in my heart.

14:39.746 --> 14:43.915
And so is the secret
to real wealth.

14:43.917 --> 14:46.517
Hold on, now. The baby man
has something to say.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.753
Go ahead, sweetie.

14:49.522 --> 14:50.755
I can't believe I have

14:50.757 --> 14:54.525
the Chelsea Grayson
on my ship!

14:54.527 --> 14:56.928
(laughing)
Yep, it's me!

14:56.930 --> 14:58.596
In the flesh!

14:58.598 --> 14:59.898
Um, how do you know me?

14:59.900 --> 15:01.666
How do I know...?

15:01.668 --> 15:03.768
Well, you invented the Schmop!

15:03.770 --> 15:06.738
You've changed the lexicon
of the Coast Guard!

15:06.740 --> 15:07.906
And soon, the Navy!

15:07.908 --> 15:10.541
We don't say,
"Swab the deck" anymore.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.510
We say, "Schmop the deck."

15:12.512 --> 15:13.912
And the hairstyle known
as the mop top?

15:13.914 --> 15:15.580
It's the Schmop top.

15:15.582 --> 15:16.614
Oh, right!
You know what?

15:16.616 --> 15:18.750
Schmop
with the Schmop-talk.

15:18.752 --> 15:21.753
(laughing)
Schmop-talk.
That's a good one, Rae.

15:21.755 --> 15:22.954
Can I use that?

15:22.956 --> 15:25.857
Well, I'm sure
if you asked her nicely...

15:25.859 --> 15:28.593
Kids, Chels. Kids!

15:28.595 --> 15:29.794
-Yeah.
-I'm cold, right?

15:29.796 --> 15:31.462
I've been waiting
to see my kids!

15:31.464 --> 15:33.765
I've been sitting
on the ocean for six days!

15:33.767 --> 15:36.534
Six days?
More like two hours.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.002
My journey, sir.
My journey.

15:38.872 --> 15:39.971
(Chelsea shivers)

15:39.973 --> 15:42.540
Well, I checked
with Homeland Security,

15:42.542 --> 15:45.576
and we can't intercept
a cruise ship
for a non-emergency.

15:45.578 --> 15:47.578
Can you drop us off
at the shore in Miami?

15:47.580 --> 15:48.813
Yeah, that's where
the cruise ship is heading.

15:48.815 --> 15:50.915
Miami is out of our patrol zone.

15:50.917 --> 15:53.651
-We're gonna have to take
you back to New York.
-Chelsea: What?

15:53.653 --> 15:56.821
Any other destination
would require a heli-Schmopter.

15:56.823 --> 15:58.022

15:59.993 --> 16:02.493
¶ ¶

16:02.495 --> 16:07.899
That's right, the secret
to real wealth is inspiration.

16:07.901 --> 16:10.835
And I am the inspiration...

16:11.905 --> 16:13.571
for the Schmop.

16:13.573 --> 16:17.775
His mom needed to keep him
as far from the mess
as possible.

16:17.777 --> 16:19.711
Thus, the invention
of the Schmop.

16:20.613 --> 16:22.847
Yes, Lil' Levi was
with his mom

16:22.849 --> 16:24.749
through the whole process.

16:24.751 --> 16:27.685
And she was always with me.

16:28.621 --> 16:29.954
And so was my Auntie Rae.

16:29.956 --> 16:33.858
Together, our moms are inspired.

16:33.860 --> 16:36.861
And maybe their
"Mom Commandments"
will inspire you.

16:36.863 --> 16:38.830
-Whoo!
-Uh-huh.

16:38.832 --> 16:41.866
-If thou sayest it...
-Uh-huh.

16:41.868 --> 16:45.536
...thy child will repeat it!

16:45.538 --> 16:46.704
Oh, talk to me now!

16:46.706 --> 16:48.606
And if thou wear-est white,

16:48.608 --> 16:50.808
thy child shall have
something on their hands.

16:50.810 --> 16:52.710
-They gotta have!
Gotta have!
-Amen!

16:52.712 --> 16:55.046
Hey, how about,
housework won't kill you,

16:55.048 --> 16:56.781
but why take the chance?

16:59.986 --> 17:02.854
I'm sorry,
that was my mom.

17:03.890 --> 17:07.657
But I do hear this one a lot
from Ms. B and Ms. G,

17:07.660 --> 17:09.560
Thou breaks it,

17:09.561 --> 17:10.994
thou's gotta buy it.

17:10.997 --> 17:12.563
-(applause)
-(murmurs of assent)

17:12.565 --> 17:13.798
Okay, okay, babies.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.066
Now, that's all gold,

17:15.068 --> 17:17.035
but how's it going
to make me rich?

17:17.037 --> 17:20.972
Miss Bertha, if my mom taught
me anything,

17:20.973 --> 17:24.709
it's that if you love someone
enough to sacrifice for them,

17:24.711 --> 17:26.077
inspiration will come to you

17:26.079 --> 17:30.681
and then you'll finally find
true wealth.

17:30.683 --> 17:32.083
(applause)

17:35.088 --> 17:38.689
That was the wow factor
I was looking for.

17:38.691 --> 17:40.958
Where is your mom, Levi?
She needs to take a bow.

17:42.662 --> 17:45.096
Sadly, we have been
separated from our moms.

17:45.098 --> 17:47.865
Last we saw them, they were
on a pier back in New York.

17:47.867 --> 17:49.934
I really miss my mom.

17:52.072 --> 17:54.005
Oh!

17:54.007 --> 17:56.707
I'm a mom and a grandmother.

17:56.709 --> 17:58.776
And I wish my kids
wanted to see me

17:58.778 --> 18:01.813
as bad as this little one
wants to see his mama.

18:03.683 --> 18:06.717
Turn this boat around now!

18:06.719 --> 18:07.852
Find their moms!

18:16.896 --> 18:18.863

-What?

18:18.865 --> 18:20.798
-If they're not gonna
help us get our kids...
-Yeah.

18:20.800 --> 18:23.101
-...we're gonna
have to help ourselves.
-Yeah, listen.

18:23.103 --> 18:25.736
I think we passed
some lifeboats on the way in.

18:25.738 --> 18:27.255
Good idea, Chels.
Good idea!

18:27.256 --> 18:28.773
You know what? On the count
of three, we make a run for it.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.141
-Okay. Yeah.
-Ready? Okay.

18:30.143 --> 18:31.909
One...

18:31.911 --> 18:33.111
two...

18:33.113 --> 18:35.079
-Whoa!
-Ahoy there, ladies!

18:35.081 --> 18:36.881
You can't just be
Schmoping up in here.

18:36.883 --> 18:38.049
Schmoping "Ahoy," you Schmop.

18:38.051 --> 18:39.884
-You can't do that!
-Yeah!

18:40.887 --> 18:42.720
My apologies.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.755
I just thought
I'd let you know that, um,

18:44.757 --> 18:46.090
your kids are
apparently starting

18:46.092 --> 18:47.992
some kind of commotion
on the cruise ship.

18:47.994 --> 18:51.796
(gasps)
Rae, our kids,
they started a mutiny!

18:51.798 --> 18:54.765
-(gasps) That's exactly
what we would've done.
-Yeah!

18:54.767 --> 18:56.100
I wouldn't call it
a mutiny exactly,

18:56.102 --> 18:58.736
but the captain has put out
an emergency call for help.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.838
-What does that mean?
-What? Yeah.

19:00.839 --> 19:02.939
It means you ladies
may just get
your ride to that boat.

19:02.942 --> 19:04.876
-Come with me.
-Both: Yes!

19:06.179 --> 19:09.113
Oh, it's okay!
We're gonna find the babies.

19:09.115 --> 19:10.815
We're gonna find them.
We'll be...

19:10.817 --> 19:12.116
We'll be right there.
We got it, yeah.

19:28.168 --> 19:30.801
But he doesn't know
where these mothers are,

19:30.803 --> 19:32.170
and he can't move
heaven and earth to find them.

19:32.172 --> 19:34.839
(booing)

19:34.841 --> 19:36.040
Look...

19:36.042 --> 19:38.109
even if we could find them,

19:38.111 --> 19:40.044
you can't just get
on or off a boat

19:40.046 --> 19:42.713
in the middle of the ocean!
It's impossible!

19:42.715 --> 19:45.116
Raven:
Nothing's impossible
when you're a mother!

19:45.118 --> 19:48.186
-(helicopter whirring overhead)
-(crowd gasping)

19:49.989 --> 19:51.789
Kids:
Mom?!

19:51.791 --> 19:54.859
(screams)
Kids, kids! I'm here!

19:54.861 --> 19:55.960
I'm here!

19:58.131 --> 20:00.231
Chelsea, your son is right here!

20:00.233 --> 20:02.900
Just open your eyes
and get a move on!

20:02.902 --> 20:04.168
I can't help it, Rae!

20:04.170 --> 20:06.837
I have a fear
of heights, ladders,

20:06.839 --> 20:08.839
you know, strong winds!

20:08.841 --> 20:11.242
Rae, help me!

20:11.244 --> 20:13.077
That was my vision!

20:13.079 --> 20:15.012
Come on down!

20:15.014 --> 20:17.048
Hold the ladder, kids!
Hold the ladder steady!

20:17.050 --> 20:18.883
Hold the ladder!

20:18.885 --> 20:21.285
(squealing, laughing)

20:28.895 --> 20:30.161
Oh, Levi!

20:32.165 --> 20:33.164
Oh!

20:33.933 --> 20:34.999
-Mom...
-Yeah?

20:35.001 --> 20:37.101
I really tried my best
to save your job.

20:37.103 --> 20:40.204
Oh honey, listen to me, okay?

20:40.206 --> 20:43.841
Being your mother is
the only job I want.

20:43.843 --> 20:44.942
I missed you, Mom.

20:44.944 --> 20:46.844
Oh, honey.

20:46.846 --> 20:48.179
Oh, I missed you, too.

20:49.949 --> 20:51.249
Family hug!

20:52.285 --> 20:53.951
Uh, um...
(clears throat)

20:53.953 --> 20:56.254
I said, "family hug."

20:57.223 --> 20:58.189
(giggles)

20:58.191 --> 20:59.957
Come here.

20:59.959 --> 21:00.925
Chelsea:
Aww.

21:00.927 --> 21:02.860
Hold on, let me
get some of this.

21:02.862 --> 21:04.962
-Nia: Bertha!
-Booker: Ay!

21:04.964 --> 21:07.265

21:07.267 --> 21:09.200
-Booker: Move!
-Nia: Whoop!

21:11.237 --> 21:14.205
Chels, the surfboard is
bigger than he is.

21:14.207 --> 21:16.874
Hey, he insisted
on carrying it.

21:17.977 --> 21:20.211
Oh! Oh, I missed my plant!

21:20.213 --> 21:21.979
Mwah! (giggles)

21:21.981 --> 21:23.981
Oh, I missed all these photos!

21:25.251 --> 21:27.318
Ooh, I do not miss
cleaning that kitchen.

21:28.988 --> 21:31.222
Tess, you left
the kitchen a mess!

21:31.224 --> 21:33.824
Hey, it was either
save the day

21:33.826 --> 21:35.226
or clean the kitchen.

21:36.262 --> 21:38.229
Oh, I'm so happy to be home!

21:38.231 --> 21:40.231
I missed you!
I missed you so much!

21:40.233 --> 21:42.066
You know what, Chels?
We need to talk.

21:42.068 --> 21:43.934
(clears throat)
You might need to sleep
on the couch

21:43.936 --> 21:45.169
for a couple of days,
because I've been using

21:45.171 --> 21:47.371
your bed as a...
as a third closet.

21:48.174 --> 21:51.008

21:55.181 --> 21:57.248
(snores softly)

22:05.958 --> 22:07.058
Oh.

22:07.960 --> 22:09.427
You're here.

22:09.429 --> 22:11.062
You're here.

22:11.931 --> 22:14.265
(chuckles)
That's right.

22:15.268 --> 22:18.102
And I'm not going anywhere.
