WEBVTT

00:06.381 --> 00:08.300
Cadmium.

00:08.383 --> 00:10.427
It was one of the chemicals Strata used.

00:12.679 --> 00:14.765
They said they disposed of it safely,

00:15.682 --> 00:19.436
but… what if they lied?

00:27.277 --> 00:30.239
Don't forget.
Lab reports are due tomorrow.

00:57.683 --> 00:58.684
Hilde?

01:00.269 --> 01:01.520
Hilde?

02:02.372 --> 02:03.957
This is my family's business.

02:04.041 --> 02:06.251
I inherited it from my dad
and my grandfather.

02:08.336 --> 02:12.090
I've been looking at this symbol
like it meant something. It's everywhere.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.433
Guys!

02:21.517 --> 02:25.020
Guys, I just realized
that Strata is everywhere.

02:30.776 --> 02:31.777
You.

02:32.819 --> 02:35.197
Hilde, you wanna come in here?

02:40.536 --> 02:42.871
Hilde, you remember--

02:42.955 --> 02:43.956
Grant Williams.

02:44.665 --> 02:47.292
The president of Strata.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.336
Good to see you again.

03:18.657 --> 03:20.033
What are you doing here?

03:20.117 --> 03:23.287
Well, you did send me
a request for comment.

03:37.467 --> 03:40.470
Strata Tech Industries used cadmium
in their factory,

03:40.554 --> 03:42.347
and now it's showing up in our water.

03:42.890 --> 03:46.435
Are you responsible for poisoning
our town's water supply, Mr. Williams?

03:46.518 --> 03:48.270
No, of course not.

03:49.021 --> 03:52.065
There was a small leak at an old
Strata facility, but we cleaned it up.

03:52.149 --> 03:54.693
I thought Wott Management owned that land.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.950
So he does work for you.

04:03.202 --> 04:04.745
It's one of our subsidiaries.

04:04.828 --> 04:07.539
So, it's a shell company.

04:07.623 --> 04:10.375
I saw what you were doing at that island.

04:10.459 --> 04:12.169
I think you're covering it up.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.962
I get how it might look that way,

04:14.046 --> 04:16.255
and I'm sorry
that we weren't more transparent,

04:16.339 --> 04:17.716
but really, it's an internal issue.

04:18.341 --> 04:22.095
Believe me, I only have Erie Harbor's
best interests in mind.

04:22.179 --> 04:25.891
Then be honest.
Take responsibility for what you did.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.982
This seems kinda personal to you, Hilde.

04:34.066 --> 04:36.193
It kinda seems like
you need me to be the bad guy.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.570
That's not what good reporters do, is it?

04:38.654 --> 04:41.532
We'll see what people think
when they read my article.

04:42.908 --> 04:46.828
Because I think maybe you are the bad guy.

04:48.372 --> 04:51.291
I think maybe
the grown-ups need to have a word outside.

04:59.883 --> 05:02.970
Wait, so Strata is responsible
for that chemical spill.

05:03.053 --> 05:05.556
I never said responsible.
We're involved in the cleanup.

05:05.639 --> 05:08.851
Okay, so then you won't mind
if she publishes the interview.

05:10.185 --> 05:11.770
She can.

05:11.854 --> 05:15.524
But I don't know what good it'll do. Like
I said, we've already taken care of it.

05:15.607 --> 05:17.484
Believe me, the last thing I want

05:17.568 --> 05:20.028
is for anyone in this town
to get hurt on my watch.

05:20.112 --> 05:22.072
Yeah, well, it's a little late for that.

05:22.155 --> 05:24.157
You know, my dad worked at Strata.

05:24.825 --> 05:29.204
Yeah, it turns out your company were using
those chemicals for, what, two decades?

05:29.288 --> 05:30.998
Or was it even longer than that?

05:31.081 --> 05:33.250
They didn't know
they were dangerous back then.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.419
It was just the way things were done.

05:35.502 --> 05:39.006
But that's no reason to scare people away
from Erie Harbor now, is it?

05:40.090 --> 05:43.427
Tank real estate prices. Cut jobs.

05:44.803 --> 05:47.264
I don't think
the town would thank you for that.

05:47.347 --> 05:50.100
Is that
supposed to be some kind of a threat?

05:50.184 --> 05:52.895
Doesn't have to be. Could be a choice.

05:52.978 --> 05:57.274
You're her parents.
You need to get control of your daughter.

06:01.653 --> 06:04.198
Right. Right.

06:22.132 --> 06:24.009
Yeah, well, I emailed my editor,

06:24.092 --> 06:27.387
and I submitted a bunch
of Freedom of Information Act requests.

06:27.471 --> 06:28.472
Yeah?

06:28.555 --> 06:31.099
You know, the records
that my dad has from that time,

06:31.183 --> 06:33.352
that does not sync up
with the story that Grant is selling.

06:33.435 --> 06:36.230
Well, let's hope Strata
left a long paper trail.

06:36.313 --> 06:39.816
Yeah, well, let's hope
it doesn't take a lifetime to sort out.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.694
Yeah, you try explaining red tape
to Hilde.

06:42.778 --> 06:45.531
Do you think we did the right thing?
Letting her publish?

06:46.532 --> 06:49.034
Here she is. What's up?

06:49.117 --> 06:52.746
My story's been live since last night,
and no one is reading it.

06:52.829 --> 06:54.665
Well, what about Donny and Spoon?

06:54.748 --> 06:56.875
They don't really care
about the paper anymore.

06:58.877 --> 07:00.754
I think they're really mad at me.

07:00.838 --> 07:04.424
Did you apologize to them for
what happened at the sheriff's department?

07:04.508 --> 07:08.220
Yeah, I mean, that must have been
pretty scary for those guys.

07:08.303 --> 07:12.015
Yeah, they don't have a dad
who's been arrested three times.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.643
Nice. Yeah, I like that.

07:14.726 --> 07:17.062
I thought publishing the article
would fix it.

07:17.145 --> 07:19.982
Strata can't hurt them
if the truth's already out there.

07:20.774 --> 07:24.111
It sounds to me like your friends
care more about being hurt by you

07:24.194 --> 07:25.237
than by Strata.

07:25.320 --> 07:27.072
So, what do I do?

07:27.155 --> 07:29.324
Hear them out. Show them you're sorry.

07:29.408 --> 07:32.286
You know what? Focus more
on your friends, right? Just for a minute.

07:33.453 --> 07:36.540
-Yeah, isn't it spirit school--
-Spirit week.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.709
Spirit school week.
Spirit week at school or something?

07:39.960 --> 07:43.213
Speaking of which, hey.
Why aren't you wearing your school colors?

07:43.297 --> 07:44.423
I don't know if you noticed,

07:44.506 --> 07:48.343
but I'm not really the school spirit
kinda person, so…

07:50.012 --> 07:51.221
That's mine.

07:53.265 --> 07:56.685
Hey, Junior, I'm sorry we keep missing--

07:56.768 --> 07:58.270
Wait, what?

07:59.479 --> 08:01.773
-What's wrong?
-Turn on the news.

08:01.857 --> 08:03.025
Uh-huh.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.903
Okay. Yep. I will call you right back.

08:12.367 --> 08:14.453
We take you live
to the Johnson family farm,

08:14.536 --> 08:16.622
which has just been sold
to Strata Tech Industries

08:16.705 --> 08:18.332
due to chemicals found on the land.

08:19.917 --> 08:21.293
Junior sold the farm?

08:22.544 --> 08:24.046
He can't give up.

08:24.796 --> 08:27.799
I wanna be transparent about everything.

08:29.301 --> 08:32.429
Traces of cadmium were found
at one of our old facilities

08:32.513 --> 08:34.681
where some chemicals
were being improperly stored.

08:34.765 --> 08:36.892
However,
we alerted the authorities immediately

08:36.975 --> 08:39.227
and conducted a full and thorough cleanup.

08:40.270 --> 08:43.106
Mr. Williams. Mr. Williams!

08:43.190 --> 08:45.025
Is there any danger to public health?

08:45.108 --> 08:46.735
Absolutely not. There never was.

08:46.818 --> 08:49.363
-Unbelievable.
-But he's lying.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.783
Yeah, well, he's controlling
the story, right?

08:52.866 --> 08:54.576
Well, spinning it his way.

08:54.660 --> 08:57.412
We purchased this land
to build a new storage facility

08:57.496 --> 09:00.624
to safely contain
any residual industrial waste.

09:00.707 --> 09:04.628
All of this is to protect Erie Harbor,
the town we love.

09:04.711 --> 09:07.673
The town we've called home
for so many years. Thank you.

09:07.756 --> 09:09.424
How do you prevent runoffs?

09:10.092 --> 09:11.844
Mr. Williams. Mr. Williams!

09:11.927 --> 09:13.971
When are you expecting
to start this build?

09:17.140 --> 09:20.143
So, that's it? Investigation over?

09:21.311 --> 09:25.732
Now no one will know the truth
about what they did to Junior or Pop-Pop.

09:26.441 --> 09:28.944
That was Grant Williams,
head of Strata Tech Industries,

09:29.027 --> 09:32.155
assuring the public
that there's nothing to worry about.

09:49.715 --> 09:51.383
Think that's the last of 'em.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.852
I know you're hurting, Mack,
but I didn't have any choice.

10:01.935 --> 10:06.148
You always have a choice.
You taught me that.

10:08.692 --> 10:10.944
You saw the test. It was rotten.

10:11.528 --> 10:15.073
I had to sell my farm to Strata,
or the state would've seized it.

10:15.157 --> 10:18.076
-Nothing I could do.
-It wasn't just your farm.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.830
It was our family's history.

10:22.497 --> 10:25.876
Our legacy, our name, our everything.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.461
Fought 'em as hard as I could.

10:27.544 --> 10:29.463
We could've fixed it!

10:30.422 --> 10:33.258
How? I can't afford cleanup costs.

10:33.342 --> 10:36.136
I barely got any money out of 'em
as it is,

10:36.220 --> 10:39.139
and if even one of these animals get sick
on that water, that's on me.

10:41.058 --> 10:42.518
If there was any other way, I--

10:43.810 --> 10:47.523
I keep seeing your grandpa's face.
Feel like I'm selling my memories.

10:48.023 --> 10:49.608
Like I'm selling a part of me.

10:49.691 --> 10:50.901
Daddy.

10:53.278 --> 10:55.531
How much time do we have?

10:56.615 --> 10:58.867
Until they take over our property?

11:00.160 --> 11:02.996
Around a week. Maybe two.

11:04.206 --> 11:06.583
I need to find new homes
for all these animals.

11:07.376 --> 11:09.378
Delay 'em, Daddy.

11:09.461 --> 11:13.257
Delay 'em as long as you can.
You gotta give me a chance to fix this.

11:13.841 --> 11:15.717
I've got real power now.

11:16.468 --> 11:20.222
There's gotta be something I can do.
There's gotta.

11:26.103 --> 11:28.188
I never bet against you before,
little girl.

11:28.272 --> 11:30.107
I'm not about to start now.

11:41.577 --> 11:44.621
-What are you wearing?
-What are you wearing?

11:44.705 --> 11:46.081
What?

11:48.041 --> 11:50.961
Sorry, I just didn't know
that you were that guy.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.713
You know, school spirit guy.

11:53.630 --> 11:56.758
But you did though. On some level.
I think you did.

11:56.842 --> 12:00.429
I mean, come on. I'm the captain
of the JV soccer team. I'm so that guy.

12:05.392 --> 12:06.643
Oh, no.

12:09.521 --> 12:12.149
I'm just kidding.
This is for soccer practice.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.942
Oh, my God.

12:14.026 --> 12:16.028
So, is Emma gonna be
at the pep rally tonight?

12:17.821 --> 12:20.866
Look, I know I was weird about it,
but she's your friend,

12:20.949 --> 12:22.618
and I wanna get to know her better.

12:23.368 --> 12:25.162
I know she's important to you.

12:26.997 --> 12:29.666
Yeah, no, we're good. So…

12:29.750 --> 12:33.170
-See, now you're making it weird.
-No, am not!

12:33.962 --> 12:35.589
-Are too.
-No, Ethan!

12:47.726 --> 12:50.020
You're looking at pictures
of you and Mom, Pop?

12:51.897 --> 12:53.065
Any progress?

12:55.984 --> 12:59.780
Well, I found some more
Plant Five employees from that time,

12:59.863 --> 13:02.950
but I can't find any public complaints
about Strata at all.

13:03.033 --> 13:06.161
Well, company town.
People are pretty trusting.

13:06.662 --> 13:09.498
Yeah, but, you know,
we can't be the only family

13:09.581 --> 13:11.708
to have suspected something, right?

13:11.792 --> 13:14.294
Yeah, well, maybe we're the first
to not stay quiet about it.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.678
Hey, wait. Let me see that.

13:26.974 --> 13:28.559
-What?
-What is it, Matty?

13:30.352 --> 13:33.647
Wow. No, I remember this day.

13:33.730 --> 13:37.442
This was Richie's
birthday party at the airfield.

13:38.235 --> 13:41.405
That would've been the last birthday
you spent together, right?

13:42.197 --> 13:44.741
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.835
Wow, yeah. I forgot.

13:54.918 --> 13:57.129
You know, Hank Gillis was there.

14:00.090 --> 14:02.759
Yeah, that's right. He was
showing us around some of the planes

14:02.843 --> 14:05.888
as, like, a treat for Richie's birthday.

14:07.306 --> 14:09.808
Yeah, this would've been
right before the crash too.

14:10.726 --> 14:11.935
The black box.

14:12.644 --> 14:13.645
Yeah.

14:19.943 --> 14:21.570
You remember Hank, Dad?

14:22.613 --> 14:25.365
You remember if you spoke to him that day?

14:26.200 --> 14:28.994
Did he seem upset about anything?

14:29.953 --> 14:33.165
Your mother thought
you looked just like me in this one.

14:34.917 --> 14:36.335
Yeah, well, she's right.

14:37.669 --> 14:38.962
Yeah, she's right.

15:11.453 --> 15:14.414
Hey, guys. Can I help?

15:15.499 --> 15:16.583
Sure.

15:17.167 --> 15:19.628
You can do whatever you want.
It's a free country.

15:23.966 --> 15:26.635
Spoon, I like those shoulder thingies.

15:27.719 --> 15:31.056
They're called epaulets. And thank you.

15:35.686 --> 15:38.146
Donny, is your dad picking you up today?

15:38.230 --> 15:39.690
It's always nice to see him.

15:40.274 --> 15:44.486
Yeah. He has time to drive me around now
ever since he was demoted from his job.

15:45.070 --> 15:48.073
He was supposed to be managing
a whole new team at Strata,

15:48.156 --> 15:51.076
and then suddenly,
they decided that it wasn't working out.

15:51.577 --> 15:53.036
Guilt by association.

15:53.871 --> 15:57.332
Do you think it was because of us?
Because of the paper?

15:59.585 --> 16:02.045
No, Hilde. I think it was because of you.

16:02.588 --> 16:05.132
Look, you got us in trouble
with the biggest company in town.

16:05.215 --> 16:07.843
They're not just giving us
community service.

16:07.926 --> 16:10.012
They're taking it out on my dad.

16:16.935 --> 16:17.936
Wait up!

16:25.194 --> 16:27.487
Come on, Whales. Let's hear it.

16:27.571 --> 16:29.448
We have Whale spirit!

16:31.408 --> 16:32.451
Go Whales!

16:33.202 --> 16:34.244
Yeah, Whales!

16:34.328 --> 16:38.373
Let's go, Whalers!
We have big games coming up this week,

16:38.457 --> 16:41.752
starting off with
our all-star JV soccer team,

16:41.835 --> 16:44.963
and don't forget about
our varsity basketball team

16:45.047 --> 16:48.342
is headed for another slam dunk win.

17:07.361 --> 17:10.696
Can you sign our service logs?
You know, to prove we're not delinquents.

17:12.115 --> 17:16.078
-Do criminals go to college?
-Probably not, Donny. Probably not.

17:17.454 --> 17:20.082
You're not criminals.
You just made a mistake.

17:20.165 --> 17:21.375
People make mistakes.

17:21.458 --> 17:24.044
You know, if I learned anything

17:24.127 --> 17:27.297
from how people treated me
after what happened with my mom,

17:27.381 --> 17:30.592
it's that just because people say things
about you, doesn't make 'em true.

17:31.510 --> 17:34.721
You three, what you have,
that's what really counts.

17:34.805 --> 17:37.140
Principal Collins,
can I steal you for a sec?

17:37.224 --> 17:39.059
-I need two minutes.
-Sure.

17:43.605 --> 17:45.065
Look, guys, I'm really sorry.

17:46.441 --> 17:50.112
I never meant for anyone to get hurt,
especially not your dad, Donny.

17:51.196 --> 17:54.199
No story is worth losing you guys
as friends.

17:55.993 --> 17:57.953
I wanna find some way to make it right.

18:03.625 --> 18:05.586
You will. We will.

18:07.629 --> 18:08.630
Together.

18:09.339 --> 18:11.341
Come on.
This calls for a group hug. Come on.

18:26.899 --> 18:29.234
Thank God.
I was thinking you bailed on me.

18:29.318 --> 18:31.862
Never. I'll always have your back, Iz.

18:31.945 --> 18:33.572
Am I interrupting something?

18:33.655 --> 18:35.616
Nope. Hang out with us.

18:36.450 --> 18:39.077
You didn't strike me
as the pep rally type, Emma.

18:39.161 --> 18:40.329
Really?

18:40.412 --> 18:43.081
Why's that, Ethan?
Do I not seem peppy to you?

18:45.459 --> 18:48.670
This is terrible, right? All this blue.

18:49.546 --> 18:51.423
Yeah, you're right. Let's get out of here.

18:51.507 --> 18:53.634
Wait, really? And go where?

18:53.717 --> 18:55.052
Come on. I'll drive.

19:33.298 --> 19:34.299
Hey, Iz.

19:37.511 --> 19:38.554
Hey.

19:38.637 --> 19:41.515
What are you guys doing here? Isn't
the pep rally just for the high school?

19:41.598 --> 19:45.894
-We had community service.
-Really? What did you guys do?

19:45.978 --> 19:47.771
Criminal trespassing,

19:47.855 --> 19:49.398
but in a purposeful way.

19:49.481 --> 19:50.983
For a good cause?

19:51.066 --> 19:54.611
Okay, cool. Yeah, so we were just leaving.

19:54.695 --> 19:58.740
Yeah, I have my dad's car.
Do you little people want a ride?

20:02.077 --> 20:04.037
We might as well be outcasts together.

20:04.121 --> 20:05.706
-I think she's serious.
-Is this for real?

20:05.789 --> 20:07.499
-We're really going?
-Are you guys coming, or what?

20:07.583 --> 20:10.627
Sure. We have time.

20:34.109 --> 20:37.029
That sucks about Strata
spinning your story like that.

20:37.112 --> 20:39.740
-Yeah, what's your next move?
-We don't have one yet.

20:39.823 --> 20:42.659
We could write another story,
but they'd just spin that one too.

20:42.743 --> 20:45.454
Sounds like this town has the heroes
it needs, but no one's listening.

20:45.537 --> 20:48.582
I don't wanna be a hero.
I wanna be a reporter.

20:48.665 --> 20:50.334
Well, what's the difference?

20:50.417 --> 20:54.087
Well, our dad always says that the job
of a journalist is to be a witness.

20:54.171 --> 20:56.256
Publishing an article
isn't gonna clean up the water,

20:56.340 --> 20:58.759
but an article can make people care.

20:58.842 --> 21:00.552
Can inspire people to change.

21:00.636 --> 21:04.223
It's too bad Strata has
so much of a louder voice than us.

21:04.932 --> 21:06.517
That doesn't mean we should stop trying.

21:06.600 --> 21:09.394
I think there's always
someone out there listening.

21:09.478 --> 21:10.979
Someone who needs to hear us.

21:11.063 --> 21:13.398
Yeah,
and even if you're at a dead end now,

21:13.482 --> 21:15.943
you just need to find another way in.

21:16.026 --> 21:19.196
I think I have an idea.
My mom's Grant's assistant.

21:19.279 --> 21:20.364
Wait, what?

21:21.990 --> 21:24.743
And all his files
are just sitting on her computer.

21:25.285 --> 21:28.455
In my house. Which I have a key to.

21:29.206 --> 21:30.541
I don't know. Are you sure?

21:30.624 --> 21:33.001
I don't want anyone to get in trouble.

21:33.585 --> 21:35.712
Yeah, those orange vests
weren't working for me.

21:35.796 --> 21:36.797
It'll be fine.

21:36.880 --> 21:40.008
We're just taking a quick look
to see if anything seems suspicious.

21:40.092 --> 21:42.761
-It is our water after all.
-And I know my mom.

21:42.845 --> 21:45.222
If Strata
really has been poisoning the town,

21:45.305 --> 21:47.182
she'll be glad we warned everyone.

21:47.266 --> 21:49.184
At some point, you gotta ask yourself,

21:49.268 --> 21:52.145
"Am I a mouse or am I a man?"

21:52.729 --> 21:53.730
I'm a man.

21:54.481 --> 21:57.150
But, I don't know,
won't your mom be, like, weirded out

21:57.234 --> 22:00.028
if we just invite them over to your house?

22:00.112 --> 22:04.032
Hey, Iz? Have you met Ethan's mom before?

22:04.116 --> 22:06.660
No, Ethan's ashamed of me.

22:06.743 --> 22:08.120
She knows who you are.

22:11.582 --> 22:13.458
That's a good idea. You're really smart.

22:16.128 --> 22:18.380
-What are you talking about?
-Then we could just--

22:18.463 --> 22:20.132
Back door. Exactly.

22:20.215 --> 22:23.093
Wait. What's happening right now?

22:23.177 --> 22:26.180
Iz, it's time to meet the parents.

22:30.517 --> 22:32.311
Careful. Careful.

22:32.853 --> 22:35.731
This is a big shot. Careful.

22:35.814 --> 22:39.359
Don't do it to me. Don't do it to me. Man!

22:40.194 --> 22:42.779
Maybe you should just give up
this principal charade and go pro.

22:44.531 --> 22:46.658
Don't worry. I'll let you keep your money.

22:53.665 --> 22:56.001
-Hey. What can I get for you?
-Nice.

22:56.084 --> 22:57.878
Wow, look who's here.

23:05.260 --> 23:07.596
-Just wave.
-No.

23:07.679 --> 23:10.849
It's not awkward.
Nothing to be worried about.

23:16.313 --> 23:17.397
Kim.

23:21.527 --> 23:22.528
Frank.

23:25.447 --> 23:26.573
How you doing?

23:27.699 --> 23:29.576
Fine, all considered.

23:30.577 --> 23:33.497
You know, since you just fired me.

23:34.414 --> 23:36.166
Yeah, that.

23:39.670 --> 23:41.505
Look, Frank, you know me.

23:41.588 --> 23:44.925
You know I didn't wanna do that.
I'm just under a lot of pressure.

23:45.801 --> 23:48.595
A lot of oversight,
a lot of people to keep happy.

23:48.679 --> 23:50.597
It's all part of being the boss.

23:50.681 --> 23:51.932
Yeah, I know.

23:52.015 --> 23:54.017
I always wanted more responsibility.

23:54.852 --> 23:58.355
I don't think I realized how much
it would hurt when my people hurt.

24:01.817 --> 24:05.654
Look, you're doing a great job over there.
Last thing I wanna do is get in your way.

24:08.323 --> 24:09.408
Good.

24:09.950 --> 24:11.368
Then come back.

24:12.077 --> 24:14.288
-Are you serious?
-You know I am.

24:15.330 --> 24:18.041
I'm launching
an investigation into Strata,

24:18.125 --> 24:20.085
and I need someone I can trust.

24:20.169 --> 24:22.254
Rutherford be damned.

24:26.508 --> 24:27.509
Now look.

24:27.593 --> 24:30.387
If you're waiting on me to beg,

24:30.470 --> 24:32.055
well, we'll be here all night.

24:33.807 --> 24:35.392
All right. All right.

24:36.727 --> 24:39.855
Yeah, I'll consider it, boss.

24:41.523 --> 24:44.026
Now, you wanna try and help me
beat this shark over here?

24:44.109 --> 24:45.194
She's killing me.

24:50.616 --> 24:51.825
Uh-oh.

24:51.909 --> 24:53.118
Hold that. Hold that.

24:53.202 --> 24:54.786
The coat's coming off.

25:33.283 --> 25:36.828
You know, I always
blamed myself for the time I lost.

25:36.912 --> 25:39.665
You know, not speaking to each other.

25:42.167 --> 25:45.212
You know, Strata did this to him.

25:49.675 --> 25:50.801
I know, honey.

26:16.201 --> 26:19.788
-Mom? Are you home?
-I'm in here, hon.

26:21.999 --> 26:23.000
Hi.

26:23.584 --> 26:25.752
You didn't tell me
we were having company over.

26:25.836 --> 26:27.963
Mom, you know how I've been
telling you about Izzy

26:28.046 --> 26:30.924
and how her parents were nice enough
to let me sleep over the other night

26:31.008 --> 26:34.052
-while you and Dad were--
-Yelling at each other?

26:34.136 --> 26:37.431
I was gonna say talking, but yeah.

26:37.514 --> 26:41.018
Anyway, this is her.
This is my girlfriend, Izzy.

26:41.768 --> 26:44.771
You are my girlfriend, and this is my mom.

26:46.273 --> 26:48.525
It's really nice to meet you, Mrs. DeLuca.

26:48.609 --> 26:51.570
Gina. Just Gina. It is so great
to have you over here finally.

26:52.821 --> 26:54.740
Wow. This your house?

26:54.823 --> 26:59.745
It's so, like, clean and nice.

26:59.828 --> 27:01.038
Thank you.

27:01.121 --> 27:03.540
Not that I thought
it was gonna be, like, dirty.

27:03.624 --> 27:04.875
It's just really nice.

27:04.958 --> 27:07.169
You guys are adorable. You really are.

27:07.252 --> 27:08.253
Come in.

27:08.337 --> 27:10.214
Can I take your coat?

27:11.965 --> 27:13.217
Thank you.

27:13.842 --> 27:15.344
We are having chicken potpie.

27:17.638 --> 27:19.556
-Yum. I love chicken potpie.
-Good.

27:22.017 --> 27:25.979
-I hope you are hungry.
-Yeah, I'm starving.

27:26.063 --> 27:28.690
This is Ethan's favorite actually.

27:30.067 --> 27:32.319
Look at that. So how was school today?

27:32.402 --> 27:36.114
It was good. You know,
same old. As good as school can be.

28:00.097 --> 28:01.473
Password.

28:07.062 --> 28:10.274
Hurry up, Hilde.
The password changes every 30 seconds.

28:11.817 --> 28:14.194
Guys, are you sure we should do this?

28:14.278 --> 28:15.279
Oh, my God.

28:15.362 --> 28:17.239
-We've come this far.
-The whole fate of the town…

28:17.322 --> 28:19.533
-Just type it in, Hilde.
-…rests on our shoulders.

28:20.075 --> 28:21.368
Okay.

28:56.153 --> 28:57.154
What?

29:12.461 --> 29:14.087
What are we even looking for?

29:22.596 --> 29:23.639
Look.

29:24.306 --> 29:26.934
That's the same guy
who's on the portrait at the mansion.

29:32.814 --> 29:35.692
Grant's grandmother's
last name was Woodruff.

29:36.485 --> 29:38.362
He must own the mansion.

29:38.445 --> 29:41.365
I knew it. That place screamed illuminati.

29:45.536 --> 29:47.496
-Wait.
-What is it?

29:48.580 --> 29:49.581
Lisko.

29:52.167 --> 29:55.170
Proceed to the route on the map.

30:01.093 --> 30:03.637
Why are there a bunch of files in here
about my family?

30:08.976 --> 30:10.018
We're all in here.

30:11.353 --> 30:12.563
It's a hit list.

30:12.646 --> 30:14.606
It's not a hit list. Don't scare her.

30:14.690 --> 30:16.942
We're gonna get taken out. All of us.

30:17.943 --> 30:20.571
Here. Just put it on the thumb drive.
We'll figure it out later.

30:51.143 --> 30:52.644
We've got a problem.

30:53.270 --> 30:56.732
It's nice to be back in Erie Harbor.
Ethan really missed it here.

30:56.815 --> 30:58.150
Obviously.

31:01.945 --> 31:03.197
I know I'm embarrassing you, honey,

31:03.280 --> 31:04.740
but you brought her here
of your own free will.

31:04.823 --> 31:07.034
Yeah, well, I guess I deserve this.

31:15.542 --> 31:16.668
What do we do?

31:16.752 --> 31:18.587
I don't know. Maybe it's nothing.

31:20.756 --> 31:21.924
-Hi.
-Hi.

31:22.007 --> 31:24.301
-Is everything okay?
-Sorry to drop by like this.

31:24.384 --> 31:28.597
I just got a weird security notification
on my phone. I thought I'd stop by.

31:28.680 --> 31:29.973
How can I help?

31:30.057 --> 31:32.559
Well, I guess
we should look at your computer.

31:34.561 --> 31:35.854
We gotta go.

31:35.938 --> 31:38.524
No. If you interrupt the download,
it'll corrupt the files.

31:38.607 --> 31:40.359
Hilde, there's no time.

31:44.530 --> 31:45.614
Hey, kids.

31:54.289 --> 31:55.749
Mom, look. Mom.

32:04.508 --> 32:07.094
We're so sorry about this.

32:09.263 --> 32:10.389
Yeah.

32:12.808 --> 32:14.685
Okay, yeah-- Thank you.

32:14.768 --> 32:17.312
Okay. Sorry again. Bye.

32:20.190 --> 32:23.527
Hilde was stealing data
from Strata servers.

32:26.238 --> 32:29.616
Matt. What is going on with our kid?

32:30.617 --> 32:34.913
Yeah, I know.
No, she pushed it too far for sure.

32:36.832 --> 32:38.917
Well, she gets this tunnel vision,

32:39.001 --> 32:41.170
and she loses sight
of what's right or wrong.

32:41.253 --> 32:42.254
Yeah.

32:44.047 --> 32:45.674
It wasn't her fault.

32:48.886 --> 32:49.887
What do you mean?

32:52.306 --> 32:55.934
It was our idea. We encouraged her.
Me, Ethan and Emma.

32:57.686 --> 32:59.188
Yeah, well, you should know better.

32:59.271 --> 33:01.857
Okay, Strata had files on us though.

33:01.940 --> 33:03.609
Hilde said
they had our whole family on there.

33:03.692 --> 33:05.402
Pictures of us, everything.

33:05.485 --> 33:08.113
Wait. Are you sure?

33:08.197 --> 33:09.823
Do you have any proof of that?

33:10.532 --> 33:13.744
We tried, but we lost the thumb drive.

33:16.705 --> 33:18.874
Come on. It's Hilde.

33:19.541 --> 33:21.126
She wouldn't lie about this.

33:23.670 --> 33:25.881
Yeah, well, that we know.

34:09.716 --> 34:10.801
Hello.

34:13.512 --> 34:14.554
Can't sleep?

34:19.935 --> 34:21.520
Come. Sit.

34:31.405 --> 34:34.283
I failed, Pop-Pop.

34:35.909 --> 34:38.871
Oh, my goodness.
What are you talking about?

34:40.455 --> 34:43.583
I did all this work,
I got in all this trouble,

34:43.667 --> 34:46.628
just to prove that Strata did this to you.

34:47.588 --> 34:49.755
I wanted to make you better, but…

34:52.384 --> 34:53.719
I couldn't do it.

34:55.304 --> 34:57.181
None of it worked.

34:58.390 --> 35:00.225
Hilde, sweetie.

35:02.603 --> 35:03.937
It did work.

35:06.023 --> 35:08.734
I'm just an old man from a small town

35:08.817 --> 35:12.613
who sold bikes and lived
at the same address for 40 years.

35:13.739 --> 35:15.824
I thought my life was small.

35:17.451 --> 35:19.411
I thought, well…

35:21.705 --> 35:23.624
except for you guys, my family,

35:25.375 --> 35:27.794
maybe I didn't matter all that much.

35:30.214 --> 35:34.885
But you showed me
there's no such thing as a small life.

35:35.928 --> 35:39.097
Because if my story can help someone else,

35:39.181 --> 35:42.851
well, then… it matters.

35:44.102 --> 35:46.688
So keep going, Hilde.

35:46.772 --> 35:48.482
Keep telling your story.

35:53.904 --> 35:55.614
Thank you, Pop-Pop.

35:56.615 --> 35:57.824
I love you.

36:00.202 --> 36:01.620
I love you.

36:06.959 --> 36:08.043
What's that?

36:09.086 --> 36:12.714
When your dad--
When your dad was your age,

36:12.798 --> 36:16.677
he never wanted me
to drop him off in front of the school.

36:16.760 --> 36:20.514
I'd have to pull over to the corner,
and he'd run off to his friends.

36:20.597 --> 36:23.600
But he always looked back.

36:24.226 --> 36:27.354
And when he did, I did this.

36:28.188 --> 36:30.607
And that way, he knew that I loved him.

36:32.067 --> 36:33.902
Even from far away.

36:36.488 --> 36:38.282
Yep, that's it.

36:42.870 --> 36:45.914
I just--
I have no idea what I'm gonna do next.

36:48.333 --> 36:49.960
Come read with me.

36:57.301 --> 37:00.262
Even Churchill took time to read
during the Blitz.

37:01.430 --> 37:04.850
Now, do you know
who Winston Churchill was?

37:05.434 --> 37:06.685
A little bit.

37:06.768 --> 37:09.855
He was the prime minister
of England during World War II.

37:09.938 --> 37:14.693
But this book is about him,
and it's a lot about his daughter, Mary.

37:16.069 --> 37:18.280
She really helped him during the war.

37:19.698 --> 37:24.494
-Like me and Dad?
-I would think very much like you and Dad.

38:38.902 --> 38:39.903
Holy--

38:39.987 --> 38:43.824
Today's date is September 20th, 1987.

38:57.254 --> 38:59.506
State your names for the record, please.

38:59.590 --> 39:00.716
Oh, my God.

39:02.759 --> 39:04.261
Hank Gillis, test pilot.

39:05.179 --> 39:07.472
Arthur Conway, air traffic control tower.

39:08.098 --> 39:09.933
And it's your belief--

39:10.017 --> 39:11.685
Come here. Take a look at this.

39:15.022 --> 39:18.025
We just got a tip
from an anonymous email address.

39:19.359 --> 39:20.652
What's it say?

39:21.528 --> 39:23.238
Yeah, well, watch.

39:23.322 --> 39:25.490
State your names for the record, please.

39:26.283 --> 39:27.534
Hank Gillis, test pilot.

39:27.618 --> 39:29.119
-Sam's dad.
-Yeah.

39:30.662 --> 39:32.831
Arthur Conway, air traffic control tower.

39:33.415 --> 39:34.499
Who?

39:36.460 --> 39:37.544
Yeah, that's…

39:39.338 --> 39:41.256
Yeah, Arthur Conway.

39:41.340 --> 39:42.799
He'd worked with Hank.

39:46.678 --> 39:49.306
And it's your belief
that the sealant we used here

39:49.389 --> 39:52.476
is causing adverse health effects.

39:52.559 --> 39:54.686
Yes. That's why we're here.

39:54.770 --> 39:58.148
I overheard some company executives
say that it was the cadmium.

39:58.232 --> 40:00.234
That they tested it, and it was toxic.

40:00.817 --> 40:02.152
And it makes sense.

40:02.236 --> 40:04.738
A lot of workers at the coating plant
have gotten sick.

40:04.821 --> 40:09.618
Strata stopped using cadmium in the '70s,
but this video is from 1987.

40:09.701 --> 40:11.662
That's proof that they lied.

40:12.538 --> 40:15.958
They kept using it even though
they knew people were getting hurt.

40:16.041 --> 40:19.086
How did you
overhear these executives exactly?

40:20.003 --> 40:22.464
I was showing my friend's kid
the new planes.

40:22.548 --> 40:24.299
I guess they didn't see us.

40:25.551 --> 40:28.679
Dad, that must have been Richie.
