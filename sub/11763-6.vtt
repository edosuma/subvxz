WEBVTT

00:00.701 --> 00:02.203
I HATE HALLOWEEN.

00:02.203 --> 00:05.436
YOU KNOW THE BEST PART
ABOUT BEING A GROWN-UP?
THIS?

00:05.436 --> 00:08.039
OKAY. THE SECOND-BESTPART
IS THAT I GET

00:08.039 --> 00:10.281
TO BUY MY OWN DAMN CANDY.
YEAH.

00:10.281 --> 00:13.714
BUT MY DAD LOVES HALLOWEEN,
SO I HAVE TO DECORATE.

00:13.714 --> 00:15.286
CHECK IT OUT.

00:15.286 --> 00:18.149
WOW. IT'S LIKE YOU
ON A SATURDAY NIGHT.
TRUE THAT.

00:18.149 --> 00:19.720
Y'ALL LOVE IT, RIGHT?
"Y'ALL"?

00:19.720 --> 00:22.223
OH, WHEN JULES' DAD
COMES TO VISIT,

00:22.223 --> 00:24.525
SHE STARTS TALKING
ALL FOLKSY.

00:24.525 --> 00:28.099
ELLIE TORRES, I'M FIXIN'
TO GET SO MAD AT YOU.
REALLY? ARE YAFIXIN'?

00:28.099 --> 00:31.132
DAMN IT. LAURIE, I WANT YOU
TO THROW SOMETHING AT ME--

00:31.132 --> 00:34.135
DONE!
LET ME FINISH. I WANT YOU
TO THROW SOMETHING AT ME

00:34.135 --> 00:37.108
WHEN I START TALKING
LIKE THAT.
GOT IT.

00:37.108 --> 00:39.470
(Southern accent) SO WHEN
DOES REDNECK DAD SHOW UP?

00:39.470 --> 00:42.273
MY DAD IS NOT A REDNECK.
WE'RE JUST FROM THE SOUTH.

00:42.273 --> 00:45.216
HE IS NAMED
AFTER A FARM ANIMAL.
(gasps)

00:45.216 --> 00:47.718
(normal voice) DON'T TELL ME.
UM, A DONKEY! NO. CHICKEN!

00:47.718 --> 00:51.182
OH, A GOAT.
YOU THINK MY DAD'S NAME
IS "GOAT"?

00:51.182 --> 00:52.483
I'M SORRY.
IT'S CHICK.

00:52.483 --> 00:54.655
AND I TAKE MY APOLOGY BACK.

00:54.655 --> 00:57.158
BE NICE. THESE VISITS
ARE ALWAYS A DISASTER.

00:57.158 --> 00:58.659
BUT NOT THIS TIME.

00:58.659 --> 01:01.232
I'VE GOT HIS FAVORITE BEER.
TRAV'S COMING HOME.

01:01.232 --> 01:03.734
I'M FIXIN' TO MAKE THIS--
OH! THANK YOU, LAURIE.

01:03.734 --> 01:06.137
I'M GOING TO MAKE THIS
THE BEST VISIT EVER.
(door opens and closes)

01:06.137 --> 01:09.270
SO NO PRESSURE.
EXCUSE ME. I'M LOOKING
FOR THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL

01:09.270 --> 01:10.771
IN THE WORLD.

01:10.771 --> 01:13.644
(gasps) OH.
IT'S NOT YOU.

01:13.644 --> 01:16.107
MY GOODNESS.

01:16.107 --> 01:18.309
DID IT HURT WHEN YOU FELL
DOWN FROM HEAVEN?

01:18.309 --> 01:22.253
I USED TO USE THAT LINE
TO GET LAID. (chuckles)

01:22.253 --> 01:24.285
HOW YOU DOING, SIR?

01:24.285 --> 01:27.158
AAH! THAT IS A MESS
OF PAPERWORK.

01:27.158 --> 01:29.160
THIS IS
STAN'S PRESCHOOL APPLICATION.

01:29.160 --> 01:31.162
YOU HAVE TO APPLY
TO PRESCHOOL?

01:31.162 --> 01:34.225
I THOUGHT YOU JUST SHOW UP
ON THE FIRST DAY, LIKE COLLEGE.
IT'S CRAZY COMPETITIVE.

01:34.225 --> 01:37.568
AS STAN'S LEGAL GUARDIAN,
I'D LIKE TO HAVE A SAY

01:37.568 --> 01:40.571
ON WHERE HE MATRICULATES.
WELL, WHEN WE NAMED YOU
AND JULES STAN'S GUARDIANS,

01:40.571 --> 01:42.733
WE MEANT
MARRIED BOBBY AND JULES,

01:42.733 --> 01:44.805
WHICH, LET'S FACE IT,
MEANT JULES.

01:44.805 --> 01:47.878
WHEN YOU GUYS SPLIT UP,
WE RELIEVED YOU OF YOUR DUTIES.

01:47.878 --> 01:50.841
SO I LOST YOUR KID
IN MY DIVORCE.

01:50.841 --> 01:53.414
IF IT WAS UP TO ME,
WHEN ELLIE DIES,

01:53.414 --> 01:55.416
YOU AND I WOULD RAISE STAN.
COME ON, E-TRAIN.

01:55.416 --> 01:57.448
I'M RESPONSIBLE ENOUGH
TO BE STAN'S GUARDIAN.

01:57.448 --> 02:00.151
HOW MANY SHOES DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE WEARING?

02:00.151 --> 02:03.894
(chuckles) OH. I'LL BE DAMNED.
WHERE'D LEFTY GO?
(mouths word)

02:03.894 --> 02:06.557
YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK I'M JUST
GONNA WAIT UNTIL DINNER.

02:06.557 --> 02:08.699
WELL, I HAVE NO RESPONSE
TO THAT.

02:08.699 --> 02:10.731
(chuckles)
(Grayson and Bobby,
high-pitched voices) OH!

02:10.731 --> 02:13.734
(all, singsongy) PENNY CAN!
(mouths words)

02:13.734 --> 02:16.437
(Bobby, normal voice)
THAT'S RIGHT, BABY. GOOD ONE.
DING-A-LING-A-LING-
A-LING-A-LING!

02:16.437 --> 02:18.869
THAT'S MY CUE,
SINCE I WAS 4.

02:18.869 --> 02:21.872
I USED TO HAVE TO HOLD
THE CAN WITH BOTH HANDS.
AW! THAT'S SO CUTE.

02:21.872 --> 02:25.346
MEMORIES. (chuckles) I-I KNOW
WHO ALL THESE OTHER FOLKS ARE,

02:25.346 --> 02:29.180
BUT WHO ARE YOU AGAIN?
GRAYSON. I'M KIND OF DATING
YOUR DAUGHTER.

02:29.180 --> 02:32.152
KIND OF?
WE'RE SLEEPING TOGETHER.
(singsongy) THANK YOU.

02:32.152 --> 02:35.155
GLAD TO HELP.
(normal voice) UH, JULES TOLD ME
THAT YOU LOVE HALLOWEEN,

02:35.155 --> 02:39.560
AND I'M HAVING A COSTUME PARTY
AT MY PUB TOMORROW NIGHT, SO...
GOD HELP ME,
I LOVE COSTUMES. (chuckles)

02:39.560 --> 02:42.633
HEY, ROBERT, YOU REMEMBER
WHEN WE WENT AS HALL AND OATES?

02:42.633 --> 02:44.465
IBECAMEHALL.

02:44.465 --> 02:46.166
OR WAS IT OATES?

02:46.166 --> 02:48.899
(chuckles) I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I HAD A BEAUTIFUL MUSTACHE.

02:48.899 --> 02:51.872
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO BE
FOR MY COSTUME.

02:51.872 --> 02:54.375
LAST YEAR I WAS OCTOMOM,
BUT... (sighs) CARRYING AROUND

02:54.375 --> 02:57.378
ALL THOSE BABY DOLLS ALL NIGHT
GOT SUPER ANNOYING.

02:57.378 --> 02:59.910
I JUST TOSSED 'EM
IN A DUMPSTER EVENTUALLY,

02:59.910 --> 03:03.284
WHICH... (chuckles) GOT CAUGHT
ON A GRAINY SECURITY CAMERA.

03:03.284 --> 03:05.786
LONG STORY SHORT--
EVENING NEWS.

03:05.786 --> 03:08.589
POLICE RAID AT MY HOUSE.
HUGE MESS.

03:08.589 --> 03:10.891
(chuckles)
I HATE DRESSING UP.

03:10.891 --> 03:14.395
NOT FOR NOTHIN',
BUT I'M NOT DOIN' IT, Y'ALL.

03:14.395 --> 03:17.898
YOU SOUND JUST LIKE YOUR MOM.
SHE HATED COSTUMES.

03:17.898 --> 03:20.901
HEY, I DON'T WANNA WAIT
TILL TOMORROW TO SEE TRAVIS.

03:20.901 --> 03:23.734
I'M--I'M GONNA GO
PICK HIM UP NOW.

03:23.734 --> 03:26.977
I NEED ME ADEZ-Y.
UH, WHO HASN'T BEEN DRINKIN'?

03:26.977 --> 03:30.311
IKNEWI WAS GONNA PAY
FOR THIS.

03:30.311 --> 03:32.583
GRANDPA?

03:32.583 --> 03:35.886
I COME TO PICK YOU UP,
CHAMP.
ALL RIGHT.
LET ME GET MY STUFF.

03:35.886 --> 03:38.419
GOOD LORD.
LOOK AT THE SIZE OF YOU.

03:38.419 --> 03:40.921
HOW'D YOUR MAMA EVER
GET YOU OUT?

03:40.921 --> 03:43.954
SHE NEVER FORGAVE ME, SIR.

03:43.954 --> 03:46.457
WHY ARE YOU GUYS STARING AT ME?
NO REASON.

03:46.457 --> 03:47.998
(screams)

03:47.998 --> 03:50.261
AAH!

03:50.261 --> 03:52.303
HA!
HAPPY HALLOWEEN, BITCH! BOO!

03:52.303 --> 03:54.605
(Chick and Kevin laugh)

03:54.605 --> 03:56.307
IT WAS NOT COOL.

03:56.307 --> 03:58.339
MY R.A. THOUGHT A GIRL
WAS GETTING ASSAULTED.

03:58.339 --> 04:01.842
HEY, DON'T BE A NANCE.
DAD, PLEASE.

04:01.842 --> 04:03.914
(sighs) LOVE YOU.

04:03.914 --> 04:05.616
(chuckles)

04:05.616 --> 04:08.819
(whispers) YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO TAKE PICTURES!

04:08.819 --> 04:10.721
(laughs, normal voice)
NICE.
(chuckles)

04:10.721 --> 04:13.784
(laughs)
OKAY, LISTEN, I'M GONNA
HAVE TO GO TO THE OFFICE.

04:13.784 --> 04:15.926
GRAYSON, WILL YOU TAKE DAD
TO THE PUB,

04:15.926 --> 04:19.330
AND I'LL MEET YOU THERE
FOR DINNER?
I'LL GO THROW ON
MY FREE FOOD PANTS.

04:19.330 --> 04:22.463
(laughs)
HOW COULD IT ALWAYS BE
A DISASTER WHENHEVISITS?

04:22.463 --> 04:25.796
I MEAN, CHICK SEEMS GREAT.
I KNOW. WITH ALL OF YOU,
HE'S CAPTAIN SUPERFUN.

04:25.796 --> 04:28.799
I MAY HAVE JUST FOUND
MY COSTUME.
WHEN IT'S
JUST THE TWO OF US,

04:28.799 --> 04:31.302
HE'S MR. EMOTIONALLY DISTANT.
THAT COULD BEMYCOSTUME.

04:31.302 --> 04:34.475
I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO DRESS UP.
WHENEVER I TRY TO CONNECT
WITH HIM, HE DUCKS AND RUNS.

04:34.475 --> 04:37.478
HE WAS NEVER LIKE THAT
WHEN MY MOM WAS ALIVE.

04:37.478 --> 04:39.510
SHE WAS
OUR BRIDGE BETWEEN US.

04:39.510 --> 04:42.012
THAT'S WHY I'M SO GLAD
YOU'RE HERE.

04:42.012 --> 04:45.486
SO I CAN BE THE NEW BRIDGE.
NO, BECAUSE HE IS GOING
TO HATE YOU. (chuckles)

04:45.486 --> 04:48.389
(chuckles) THAT WAY,
WHEN I SHOW UP FOR DINNER,

04:48.389 --> 04:51.061
HE'S GONNA WANT TO CUT
THE DEAD WEIGHT, WHICH IS YOU...

04:51.061 --> 04:53.023
(chuckles) AND THEN
WE COULD END UP HAVING

04:53.023 --> 04:56.527
NICE, QUALITY FATHER-DAUGHTER
TIME, JUST THE TWO OF US.

04:56.527 --> 04:58.799
IT'S A GREAT PLAN, HUH?
AWESOME!

04:58.799 --> 05:02.032
WHY WOULD HE HATE ME?
FOR STARTERS,
YOUR NAME'S GRAYSON.

05:02.032 --> 05:04.875
GRAYSON IS A COOL NAME.
FOR A HUNTING DOG.

05:04.875 --> 05:07.408
PLUS, MY DAD'S
THE SALT OF THE EARTH,

05:07.408 --> 05:10.411
AND YOU'RE, LIKE,
SOME VAIN LITTLE DANDY.
I'M NOT A VAIN LITTLE--

05:10.411 --> 05:13.914
MIRROR.
WHAT'S UP, PLAYBOY?
AW, YOU ALREADY KNOW. (chuckles)

05:13.914 --> 05:16.417
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU
TALKING TO?

05:16.417 --> 05:18.889
(beep)
THAT WAS
THE SCHILLER SCHOOL.

05:18.889 --> 05:19.920
STAN ISTENTH
ON THE WAITING LIST.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.623
IT'S NOT FAIR.
WHEN I HUGGED THE HEADMASTER,

05:22.623 --> 05:24.755
I LET HIM PRESS UP
AGAINST THE TWINS.

05:24.755 --> 05:26.827
HE GOT SUGAR
FROM THE ICE QUEEN?

05:26.827 --> 05:28.328
HE'S A DEAD MAN!

05:28.328 --> 05:29.960
CALM DOWN. I LIKED IT.

05:29.960 --> 05:31.331
COOL.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.435
WAIT. DON BAUER IS
HEADMASTER AT SCHILLER?

05:34.435 --> 05:37.337
GUESS WHO HE GOLFS WITH?

05:37.337 --> 05:39.339
(click)

05:39.339 --> 05:40.971
THERE YOU ARE, LEFTY.

05:40.971 --> 05:43.444
GRAYSON, I'M ABOUT
TO WALK IN AND SEE YOU,

05:43.444 --> 05:45.446
SO I WANT TO APOLOGIZE
IN ADVANCE

05:45.446 --> 05:47.448
FOR MAKING FUN
OF YOUR $100 HAIRCUT.

05:47.448 --> 05:49.980
SO THANKS AGAIN
FOR LETTING MY DAD...

05:49.980 --> 05:51.452
HATE YOU.

05:51.452 --> 05:53.624

05:53.624 --> 05:55.926

YAY.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.372
(chuckles)
HEY, WE JUST GOT STARTED,

06:12.372 --> 06:14.905

06:14.905 --> 06:16.407

06:16.407 --> 06:17.908

06:17.908 --> 06:19.950

HMM. OH, HEY, LAURIE.

06:19.950 --> 06:21.752

06:38.098 --> 06:42.833
в™Є ...FAMILY JULES в™Є

06:42.833 --> 06:45.806
EVERY HOUSE OUGHT TO HAVE
A JAM ROOM, DON'T YOU THINK?

06:45.806 --> 06:49.079
IDEALLY, IT WOULDN'T BE
IN MY BEDROOM.

06:49.079 --> 06:52.082
WELL, I ALREADY WENT ALL THE WAY
THROUGH THE SPORTS SECTION

06:52.082 --> 06:53.614
ON THE CRAPPER,

06:53.614 --> 06:56.687
SO I'M FIXIN' TO SPEND THE REST
OF THE MORNING IN HERE.
COUNT ME IN.

06:56.687 --> 06:58.749
(chuckles) HEY.
OH, YEAH.

06:58.749 --> 07:01.021
(plays beats)

07:01.021 --> 07:03.654
DRUMS AND GUITAR.
I'M SO LUCKY.

07:03.654 --> 07:05.756
I GOTTA GO. (sighs)

07:05.756 --> 07:08.499
WHATEVER, DUDE. IF IT'S
TOO LOUD, YOU'RE TOO OLD.

07:08.499 --> 07:10.000
AM I RIGHT?

07:10.000 --> 07:12.132
LET'S PLAY.

07:12.132 --> 07:15.736
SO, DAD, I MISSED YOU.
HOW YA BEEN?

07:15.736 --> 07:19.439
THAT SOUNDS MORE LIKE
TALKIN' THAN PLAYIN'.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.742
(chuckles) OKAY, WHAT IF
I, UH, DROP A BEAT?

07:21.742 --> 07:25.075
в™Є SO, DAD, I MISSED YOU,
HOW YOU BEEN? в™Є

07:25.075 --> 07:27.678
I THINK I'M GONNA GO
TAKE A WALK.

07:27.678 --> 07:29.980
DO YOU REMEMBER
HOW MOM USED TO MAKE US

07:29.980 --> 07:33.083
START EVERY SINGLE MORNING BY
SAYING WHY WE LOVED EACH OTHER?

07:33.083 --> 07:36.527
THAT'S WHY
I QUIT EATIN' BREAKFAST.

07:36.527 --> 07:38.088
YOU KNOW WHAT, DAD?

07:38.088 --> 07:40.060
EVERY TIME YOU COME
TO VISIT ME,

07:40.060 --> 07:42.132
I-I ALWAYS HOPE
THAT YOU'RE GONNA WANT

07:42.132 --> 07:45.135
TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH
JUST ME, BUT YOU NEVER DO.

07:45.135 --> 07:47.467
I GUESS THAT'S FINE,

07:47.467 --> 07:49.970
BUT THERE'S REALLY NO REASON
FOR YOU TO BE HERE, IS THERE?

07:49.970 --> 07:52.573
YOU SOUND
JUST LIKE YOUR MOTHER

07:52.573 --> 07:54.575
WHEN SHE GOT TICKED OFF.

07:54.575 --> 07:56.577
NOW GO AHEAD AND DO
WHAT SHE ALWAYS DID

07:56.577 --> 07:59.079
AND JUST FINISH ME OFF
WITH A BIG ONE.

07:59.079 --> 08:03.053
WHY DON'T YOU GET THE HECK
OUT OF MY HOUSE?

08:03.053 --> 08:06.156
ATTAGIRL.

08:06.156 --> 08:08.158
I AM GETTIN' TRICK-OR-TREATERS
THIS YEAR!

08:08.158 --> 08:10.861
A BOAT IS NOT A HOME
UNTIL YOU USE CANDY

08:10.861 --> 08:12.663
TO LURE CHILDREN ON IT.

08:12.663 --> 08:15.165
DAD, NEVER USE THE WORDS
"LURE" AND "CHILDREN"

08:15.165 --> 08:17.197
IN THE SAME SENTENCE.
(chuckles)

08:17.197 --> 08:19.029
COOL. HAUNTED BOAT!

08:19.029 --> 08:22.032
THANKS, BUDDY.
HEY, CAN WE DRESS STAN UP
AS A TINY PIRATE

08:22.032 --> 08:25.105
AND STRAP HIM
TO THE TOP OF THE--
NO. BOBBY, CAN WE TALK?

08:25.105 --> 08:28.008
AND SINCE YOU'RE PALS,
WE THOUGHT YOU COULD TALK

08:28.008 --> 08:31.011
TO THE HEADMASTER TO SEE
IF HE COULD MOVE STAN TO THE TOP

08:31.011 --> 08:35.215
OF THE WAITING LIST, AND, UH,
WE GOT YOU THIS AS A THANK YOU.

08:35.215 --> 08:37.688
AW, THAT'S SWEET, ELLIE.

08:37.688 --> 08:39.750
I WANT BACK IN AS GUARDIAN.

08:39.750 --> 08:41.521
(laughs)

08:41.521 --> 08:43.624
THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

08:43.624 --> 08:47.057
THEY RAN OUT OF PLASTIC SPIDERS,
SO I GOT SOME FAKE DOG POOPS.

08:47.057 --> 08:50.060
BUT IT CAN STILL BE AS SCARY.
WE'LL PUT 'EM IN THE WEB,

08:50.060 --> 08:54.064
AND PEOPLE WILL BE LIKE,
"DAMN, HOW BIG IS THAT SPIDER?"
GREAT IDEA, LAURIE.

08:54.064 --> 08:56.767
ARE YOU STILL PISSY
'CAUSE I SCARED YOU?

08:56.767 --> 08:59.770
DUDE, WE SCARE EACH OTHER
EVERY YEAR.
(imitates teenager) YEAH,
BUT THAT'S WHEN I WAS AKID.

08:59.770 --> 09:02.012
I'MOVERIT.
(scoffs)

09:02.012 --> 09:04.044
HEY, TRAV.
I GOT A COSTUME IDEA.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.046
YOU AND ME--
CAPTAIN AND TENNILLE.

09:06.046 --> 09:09.780
AND NO FIGHTS ABOUT THIS.
I'M TENNILLE.
(normal voice)
BUT I'M NOT REALLY DOING

09:09.780 --> 09:12.653
A COSTUME THIS YEAR, GRAMP.
HE'S JUST BEING A TYPICAL KID
WHO GOES TO COLLEGE AND THEN

09:12.653 --> 09:16.256
THINKS HE'S TOO MATURE FOR ALL
THE FUN STUFF HE USED TO LOVE.

09:16.256 --> 09:20.090
WELL, IF YOU EVER OUTGROW
GO-CARTS, YOU'RE OUT OF MY WILL.

09:20.090 --> 09:22.963
GOT IT.
LAURIE, I DON'T THINK THAT--

09:22.963 --> 09:25.095
WHERE THE HELL
DID LAURIE GO?
BOO!

09:25.095 --> 09:27.798
AAH!
(laughs) THAT'S TWICE!
(deep voice)PEACE!

09:27.798 --> 09:29.800
THAT'S A FUN WAY TO SAY
GOOD-BYE, ISN'T IT?

09:29.800 --> 09:32.072
(deep voice)PEACE!

09:32.072 --> 09:33.944
(normal voice)
IT'S NOT ME, ISN'T IT?
NO, NOT REALLY.

09:33.944 --> 09:35.946
DID YOU REALLY TELL CHICK
TO...

09:35.946 --> 09:38.308
(Southern accent) "GET THE HECK
OUTTA THIS HERE HOUSE"?

09:38.308 --> 09:40.751
I DIDN'T DO IT LIKE
YOSEMITE SAM, BUT YEAH.

09:40.751 --> 09:43.984
Y'ALL JUST DON'T GET IT.
STOP THROWING THINGS!

09:43.984 --> 09:45.916
"Y'ALL" IS OKAY.

09:45.916 --> 09:49.690
WHEN I WAS A KID, MY DAD COULD
SENSE WHEN I NEEDED HIM,

09:49.690 --> 09:52.693
AND HE'D JUST--HE'D PUT
HIS ARMS OUT LIKE THIS,

09:52.693 --> 09:56.667
AND... OH, HIS HUG WOULD
MAKE IT SO MUCH BETTER.

09:56.667 --> 09:59.700
COME HERE.

09:59.700 --> 10:02.272
UGH. YOU'RE JUST
SO SWEATY. JEEZ.

10:02.272 --> 10:06.106
OKAY. WELL, MY WORK HERE IS
DONE. SEE YOU AT THE PARTY.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.608
WHAT'S YOUR COSTUME GONNA BE?
MOLE? RAT?

10:08.608 --> 10:10.110
SOMETHING WITH BEADY EYES?

10:10.110 --> 10:12.112
(chuckles)
SAME THING AS EVERY YEAR.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.614
I'M JUST GONNA THROW
ON MY PRINCE COSTUME,

10:14.614 --> 10:16.286
AND BE HANDSOME.

10:16.286 --> 10:19.289
YOU WATCH. I'M GONNA GET
MY DAD TO OPEN UP TO ME.
DO YOU REALLY THINK

10:19.289 --> 10:23.153
YOU'RE GONNA CHANGE WHO HE IS AS
A PERSON IN THE NEXT TWO DAYS?
NO.

10:23.153 --> 10:25.195
NO, WHEN THE WEEKEND'S OVER,

10:25.195 --> 10:27.197
YOU'RE GONNA KNOW
THAT YOU HURT HIS FEELINGS.

10:27.197 --> 10:28.929
YOU'RE GONNA START
FEELING GUILTY,

10:28.929 --> 10:32.162
START SPIRALING OUT OF CONTROL--
START STRESS EATING,
WHICH SUCKS,

10:32.162 --> 10:35.065
BECAUSE I'M GONNA HAVE TO
DRIVE TO THE KEYS TO GET YOU

10:35.065 --> 10:38.068
THOSE CONCH FRITTERS
THAT YOU LOVE--
ALL BECAUSE YOU WERE MEAN
TO YOUR DADDY.

10:38.068 --> 10:40.971
OH, MY GOD.
I WAS MEAN TO MY DADDY.

10:40.971 --> 10:44.114
OH, GREAT. NOW MY CAR IS
GONNA SMELL LIKE CONCH.
ARE YOU SURE IT WAS CONCH?

10:44.114 --> 10:47.117
YOU KNOW WHAT? IF HE ONLY WANTS
TO BE AROUND OTHER PEOPLE,

10:47.117 --> 10:50.150
THEN FINE. I'LL GO
TO THE PARTY WITH HIM.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.152
HE LOVES TO DRESS UP
IN COSTUMES,

10:52.152 --> 10:54.154
THEN I'M GONNA PUT ON
A COSTUME.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.286
GRAYSON'S MY PRINCE,
AND I'M GONNA BE HIS PRINCESS.

10:56.286 --> 10:59.129
YOU WATCH. I CAN DO THIS.
OH. LOVE YOUR COSTUME.
BANGKOK PROSTITUTE, RIGHT?

10:59.129 --> 11:02.092
AH, HA HA. NOW I DEFINITELY KNOW
WHAT I'M GONNA BE FOR HALLOWEEN.

11:02.092 --> 11:03.233
(chuckles)

11:03.233 --> 11:05.796
(indistinct conversations)

11:05.796 --> 11:09.099
(imitating Ellie)
TA-DA. I'M YOUR WIFE.

11:09.099 --> 11:11.101
(imitates Burt Reynolds) YOU'RE
NOT DINAH SHORE. (chuckles)

11:11.101 --> 11:13.073
(normal voice) OH, THIS IS
GOING TO CAUSE PROBLEMS.

11:13.073 --> 11:15.075
(imitating Laurie)
HEY, PEEPS.

11:15.075 --> 11:17.948
LET'S GET OUR DRINK ON.
WHAT, WHAT? WHAT, WHAT?

11:17.948 --> 11:20.050
SO DUMB.

11:20.050 --> 11:22.753
(gasps)
ANDY,
GO DO WHATEVER I SAY,

11:22.753 --> 11:25.155
EVEN THOUGH YOU MAKE
ALL THE MONEY.

11:25.155 --> 11:28.218
NOBODY PUT A CAMERA
ON THE FLOOR,

11:28.218 --> 11:30.220
'CAUSE I NEVER WEAR...
UNDERWEAR.

11:30.220 --> 11:32.222
(high-pitched voice)
WHAT, WHAT, WHAT?

11:32.222 --> 11:35.425
(laughs)
(laughs)

11:35.425 --> 11:38.929
I AM SO TURNED ON RIGHT NOW.
WHO ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BE?

11:38.929 --> 11:40.931
I'M WINDY GUY. IT'S GREAT.

11:40.931 --> 11:44.234
IF I GET TRAPPED BY SOMEONE
I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO,

11:44.234 --> 11:47.137
I JUST GET BLOWN AWAY.
WHOO! (laughs)

11:47.137 --> 11:50.210
HEY, ELLIE, DO YOU WANT--
OH. NO.

11:50.210 --> 11:53.914
REAL ELLIE, YOU WANNA GO KNOCK
OUT THAT LEGAL GUARDIAN CHAT?
(imitates Laurie) WHATEVS.

11:53.914 --> 11:55.215
(Laurie) JULES.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.917
OH. (chuckles)

11:56.917 --> 11:58.919
I CAN SAY
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL,

11:58.919 --> 12:01.121
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON
I'M EVER NICE TO.

12:01.121 --> 12:03.894
OH, THANK YOU.
OH, LOVE THE SALMON TIE.

12:03.894 --> 12:06.196
(chuckles, lowered voice)
HE MUST BE AN OFFICE BEAR.

12:06.196 --> 12:08.128
(laughs)

12:08.128 --> 12:11.201
MY DAD'S NOT HERE YET. I WANT
HIM TO SEE ME WITH MY PRINCE.

12:11.201 --> 12:13.864
(normal voice)
WHERE'S MY PRINCE?

12:13.864 --> 12:16.506
DEARLY BELOVED,
I'M RIGHT HERE.

12:16.506 --> 12:18.338
OH, THAT PRINCE.

12:18.338 --> 12:21.341
(laughs) YOUR DAD ASKED ME
TO COME REFILL HIS CANDY BOWL,

12:21.341 --> 12:24.344
AND SINCE THE ONLY GUY HITTING
ON ME WAS ANDY, I WAS LIKE,

12:24.344 --> 12:27.347
WHY NOT? DO YOU KNOW WHAT
MY BIGGEST PET PEEVE IS?

12:27.347 --> 12:29.479
WHEN YOU PUT OUT
A "TAKE ONE" SIGN

12:29.479 --> 12:33.483
AND THEN KIDS SWIPE
THE WHOLE BOWL.
I ACTUALLY ASKED MY DAD
TO MAKE YOU GO TO HIS BOAT.

12:33.483 --> 12:36.486
WHY IS THAT, TRAVIS?
BECAUSE...

12:36.486 --> 12:39.129
(high-pitched voice)
I'M HERE!
AAH!

12:39.129 --> 12:42.132
AH! (laughs, deep voice)
TASTE THE CHEESE!

12:42.132 --> 12:44.835
I KNEW
YOU WOULD SCARE ME BACK!

12:44.835 --> 12:47.337
THIS PROVES YOU STILL LOVE
HALLOWEEN, TRAVIS!

12:47.337 --> 12:49.339
(normal voice)
NO, IT DOESN'T.

12:49.339 --> 12:51.441
OKAY. OH, BOY. I'M STUCK.

12:51.441 --> 12:53.473
TRAVIS,
HELP ME OUT, HONEY.

12:53.473 --> 12:56.306
(chuckles) NO, I'M GOOD.
(deep voice)PEACE!

12:56.306 --> 12:59.349
COME ON! HEY, KID.
YOU WANNA HELP ME OUT, PLEASE?

12:59.349 --> 13:03.183
HEY, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
THINKING. I'M WARNING YOU.

13:03.183 --> 13:05.415
JUST TAKE ONE,
LIKE THE SIGN SAYS.

13:05.415 --> 13:07.787
NO! I WILL FIND YOU,

13:07.787 --> 13:11.221
AND I WILLKILLYOU,
YOU LITTLE... AAH!

13:11.221 --> 13:12.522
(imitates
Burt Reynolds' laugh)

13:12.522 --> 13:15.325
(normal voice) HUH?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

13:15.325 --> 13:18.929
YOU'RE DOM DeLUISE DRESSED
AS BURT REYNOLDS. IT'S GENIUS.
HOW COULD YOU?

13:18.929 --> 13:20.270
в™Єв™Єв™Є

13:20.270 --> 13:24.274
OKAY. IF YOU WANT TO GAIN
BACK CUSTODY OF STAN,

13:24.274 --> 13:26.276
I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS.

13:26.276 --> 13:29.579
LET'S SAY JULES, ANDY, AND I
DIE IN A PLANE CRASH--

13:29.579 --> 13:31.281
STOP RIGHT THERE.

13:31.281 --> 13:34.244
DIE IN A NINJA BATTLE.
MUCH COOLER.

13:34.244 --> 13:36.386
OH, I COULD DIE DODGING
CHINESE STARS.

13:36.386 --> 13:41.121
(makes whooshing sounds)

13:41.121 --> 13:43.153
(imitates Laurie)
SERIOUSLY?

13:43.153 --> 13:46.226
(normal voice) COME ON. WE'RE
DEAD. YOU HAVE CUSTODY OF STAN.

13:46.226 --> 13:48.228
WHAT'S THE FIRST THING
YOU DO?

13:48.228 --> 13:49.529
I'D CHANGE HIS NAME.

13:49.529 --> 13:52.362
NEVER LIKED STAN.
I'D CALL HIM RICK.

13:52.362 --> 13:54.464
HE'S KIDDING.
HE--HE LOVES THE NAME "STAN."

13:54.464 --> 13:57.407
I LIKE RICK. RICK'S GOT
YOUR BACK AT A BAR FIGHT.

13:57.407 --> 14:01.111
MY BABY IS NOT GETTING
YOUR BACK IN A BAR FIGHT!
NOT AS A BABY.

14:01.111 --> 14:03.573
COME ON. (chuckles)
WE'D GET OUR ASSES KICKED.

14:03.573 --> 14:06.576
THIS IS FUN. I'M GONNA
GET US SOME MORE BEER,

14:06.576 --> 14:10.020
AND THEN WE'LL KEEP PLAYIN'.
DON'T BOTHER. ANDY, THE THOUGHT
OF HIM RAISING STAN--

14:10.020 --> 14:12.252
IT'S JUST NOT WORTH IT.

14:12.252 --> 14:15.325
(lowered voice) OOH.

14:15.325 --> 14:17.457
GREAT. YOU MADE HIM
BLOW AWAY SAD.

14:17.457 --> 14:19.389
(chuckles) OKAY, YOGI.

14:19.389 --> 14:21.892
LET'S KEEP
OUR PAWS TO OURSELVES.

14:21.892 --> 14:25.135
HEY!

14:25.135 --> 14:28.168
I MISSED A TEXT FROM MY DAD.
WHAT'S WRONG?

14:28.168 --> 14:32.142
HE'S NOT COMING.
HE PACKED UP AND WENT HOME.

14:32.142 --> 14:35.105
(sighs)

14:41.952 --> 14:44.884
I CAN'T BELIEVE MY DAD LEFT.
IT REALLY IS UNBELIEVABLE.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.157
WHA--STUPID BEAR!
YOU'RE NOT EVEN EATING THEM.

14:47.157 --> 14:50.390
(growls)
THAT IS BY FAR
THE MOST ANNOYING BEAR HERE.

14:50.390 --> 14:53.663
WHY COULDN'T HE BE
MORE LIKE THE PANDA?

14:53.663 --> 14:56.066
THE PANDA'S AWESOME.
YOU GET SOME, LING LING!

14:56.066 --> 14:59.669
I HOPE HE'S NOT A MURDERER.
YOUR DAD'S THE BAD GUY IN THIS.
DON'T LET HIM RUIN YOUR NIGHT.

14:59.669 --> 15:02.572
NO ONE CAN BRING ME DOWN.
HELLO, JULES.

15:02.572 --> 15:04.975
EXCEPT HER.
(chuckles)

15:04.975 --> 15:06.977
HI, BARB. WHAT ARE YOU,
A SHREDDED WHEAT?

15:06.977 --> 15:09.539
(chuckles) OH, NO.
I'M A HAYSTACK.
(chuckles) OH.

15:09.539 --> 15:12.382
HEY, FELLAS.
WHO WANTS A ROLL IN THE HAY?

15:12.382 --> 15:15.085
(men wolf whistle)
OH,EVERYBODY.(chuckles)

15:15.085 --> 15:16.386
A NEW LOW.

15:16.386 --> 15:21.921
WOW, I THOUGHT BARB WOULD PICK
A COSTUME MORE...REVEALING!

15:21.921 --> 15:23.954
(chuckles) WOW. OHH.
OH. WOW. BRAVO.
THAT'S... WOW.

15:23.954 --> 15:26.056
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.
WHY SO SAD?

15:26.056 --> 15:29.059
MY DAD USED TO WALK AROUND
IN UNDERWEAR JUST LIKE THAT.

15:30.560 --> 15:33.163
(chuckles) OH, LOOK,
IT'S A MEAN PERSON DRESSED

15:33.163 --> 15:36.166
AS AN AWESOME PERSON.
I DIDN'T GIVE YOU
WHAT YOU WANTED,

15:36.166 --> 15:38.408
SO YOU WON'T HELP STAN
GET INTO PRESCHOOL?

15:38.408 --> 15:40.410
WEAK SAUCE, MY FRIEND!
OH, PLEASE.

15:40.410 --> 15:43.413
THE SECOND I FOUND OUT YOU
NEEDED ME, I CALLED MY BUDDY,

15:43.413 --> 15:47.177
AND I GOT STAN INTO
THAT FANCY BABY SCHOOL.
YOU DID?

15:47.177 --> 15:49.519
OF COURSE I DID.
I'LL ALWAYS HELP THAT KID,

15:49.519 --> 15:51.521
EVEN IF YOU'RE BEING
A POWER TOOL.

15:51.521 --> 15:54.724
BOOM! ANGRY BLOWOFF.

16:01.661 --> 16:03.163
AAH! CHAIR ARMS!

16:03.163 --> 16:04.664
(sighs)

16:04.664 --> 16:06.666
(laughs)
TASTE THAT CHEESE.

16:06.666 --> 16:10.040
STOP SCARING ME.
I'M NOT BUILT FOR IT.

16:10.040 --> 16:12.042
NO. PLUS,
YOU'RE A TOTAL LIAR.

16:12.042 --> 16:14.044
LOOK AT YOU,
SITTING HERE SMILING,

16:14.044 --> 16:16.146
LOOKING AT OLD PICTURES.
DUDE, YOU LOVE HALLOWEEN.

16:16.146 --> 16:19.149
WHY DO YOU CARE SO MUCH?
IT'S JUST, TRAVIS, I'VE BEEN
THROUGH THIS 100 TIMES

16:19.149 --> 16:22.082
WITH ALL OF MY FRIENDS FROM
HIGH SCHOOL WHO WENT TO COLLEGE,

16:22.082 --> 16:23.383
AND I STAYED BEHIND,

16:23.383 --> 16:26.156
AND THEN THEY CAME BACK
TOO COOL FOR SCHOOL,

16:26.156 --> 16:29.189
AND YOU KNOW HOW MANY
I'M STILL TIGHT WITH? BAGEL.
(singsongy) WHATEVER.

16:29.189 --> 16:31.691
(chuckles, normal voice) THAT'S
THE YEAR I DRESSED UP AS A BEAR.

16:31.691 --> 16:34.394
I GOT TO MESS WITH EVERYONE,
AND NO ONE KNEW IT WAS ME.
(sighs)

16:34.394 --> 16:36.396
IT WAS GRANDPA'S IDEA.
HE USED TO SAY,

16:36.396 --> 16:39.369
YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH JUST ABOUT
ANYTHING IF YOU'RE A... BEAR.

16:39.369 --> 16:43.033
YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE?
YOU KNOW, BESIDES YOUR COSTUME.
YOU'RE LUCKY

16:43.033 --> 16:46.176
THE REAL PRINCE WASN'T HERE
TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT.

16:46.176 --> 16:49.779
OH, YEAH. BECAUSE I
COULDN'T KICK HIS ASS.
(high-pitched voice) OOH!

16:49.779 --> 16:51.781
I JUST DON'T GET IT.

16:51.781 --> 16:55.285
WHY IS IT SO HARD
FOR HIM TO BE WITH ME?

16:55.285 --> 16:56.786
I'M GONNA GO HOME.

17:21.471 --> 17:23.473
YOU ARE MY DAD, RIGHT?

17:25.745 --> 17:27.247
NOTHIN' YOU CAN SAY

17:27.247 --> 17:31.251
THAT'S GONNA MAKE ME WANT
TO TALK TO YOU.
(singsongy) OH.

17:31.251 --> 17:33.453
BEAT IT.
OOH.

17:33.453 --> 17:35.225
PARK IT.

17:35.225 --> 17:38.258
(normal voice)
I KNOW I'M HARD ON YOU.

17:38.258 --> 17:40.230
I MAKE FUN OF YOUR BOAT,

17:40.230 --> 17:43.233
YOUR JOB,
THE WAY YOU TALK.

17:43.233 --> 17:45.235
(imitates Bobby) HEY, BUD!

17:45.235 --> 17:49.239
(grunts)

17:49.239 --> 17:51.241
(normal voice)
WHICH IS NOT REALLY TALKING.

17:51.241 --> 17:53.273
BUT EVEN THOUGH
I WAS A JERK TO YOU,

17:53.273 --> 17:56.806
YOU STILL PUT STAN FIRST.
I'LL ALWAYS LOOK OUT
FOR HIM.

17:56.806 --> 17:59.078
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE BACK IN
AS GUARDIAN.

17:59.078 --> 18:02.252
(laughs)
I JUST KNOW IN MY HEART THAT
IF ANYTHING EVER HAPPENED TO ME,

18:02.252 --> 18:05.215
YOU WOULD DO WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO HELP STAN GROW UP

18:05.215 --> 18:07.387
TO BE THE MAN THAT,
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT.

18:07.387 --> 18:11.161
SO IF, UH, YOU, ANDY, AND JULES
BITE THE DUST, HE'S MINE?

18:11.161 --> 18:14.164
YES.
YOU'RE NEVER RIDING
IN THE SAME CAR

18:14.164 --> 18:16.366
WITH THOSE TWO AGAIN,
ARE YA?
NO CHANCE.

18:18.398 --> 18:20.099
(imitating Andy)
HEY, HONEY.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.631
(laughs) OH, MY GOD.

18:21.631 --> 18:23.633
MY WIFE'S WAY TOO HOT
FOR ME,

18:23.633 --> 18:25.705
AND I'M CUBAN,
BUT I DON'T SPEAK SPANISH.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.607
DUDE, THIS IS AWESOME!

18:27.607 --> 18:29.339
COME ON!

18:29.339 --> 18:32.282
COME ON!
(laughs)

18:32.282 --> 18:35.485
THIS BEAR SUIT--WELL, THAT
WAS JUST ME BEING SILLY.

18:35.485 --> 18:38.488
PLUS, IT'S A LITTLE BIT
OF PAYBACK FOR THIS MORNING

18:38.488 --> 18:40.190
AND ALL THAT...

18:40.190 --> 18:43.253
"GET THE HECK OUTTA
MY HOUSE!"

18:43.253 --> 18:46.826
WHY DOES EVERYONE THINK I SWING

MAKE US BE REAL WITH EACH OTHER,

18:55.735 --> 18:59.669

MY BIGGEST FEAR IN LIFE

19:37.477 --> 19:40.250
