I'm unforgettable.

That was the best idea
you've had all day.

00:14.582 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.753
-Previously on Empire...
-You had a mild heart attack.

00:19.787 --> 00:21.255
You might not be so lucky
the next time.

00:21.289 --> 00:23.657
-The car bomb. It was me.
-(yells)

00:23.691 --> 00:25.526
-I'm sorry.
-I hope it's enough.

00:25.559 --> 00:26.927
I'm done apologizing.
I'm done

00:26.960 --> 00:28.662
doing stupid interviews
that I don't want to do.

00:28.696 --> 00:30.231
Got room for only one man
in your life.

00:30.264 --> 00:31.832
He's sitting
right in front of you.

00:31.865 --> 00:34.102
-"Desperate" is what you've
made us.
-Everyone will be paid

00:34.135 --> 00:36.003
once I push this deal through
at Empire,

00:36.036 --> 00:37.271
and we'll all be back
where we belong.

00:37.305 --> 00:39.073
When do we tell the Lyons
that I'm buying Empire?

00:39.107 --> 00:41.209
-Leave the Lyons to me.
-You let Eddie into Empire,

00:41.242 --> 00:43.010
and he's about to steal it
from under you.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.545
I stepped in when you needed me.

00:44.578 --> 00:46.046
I saved your ass!

00:46.080 --> 00:47.981
Get the hell out of my house.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.384
Come on, Ma.

00:50.418 --> 00:51.919
Want to make sure
you get in, Ma.

00:51.952 --> 00:53.921
Boy, I had a heart attack.

00:53.954 --> 00:55.856
Okay? I still got both my legs.

00:55.889 --> 00:57.925
Oh, no offense, Lucious.

00:57.958 --> 00:59.293
LUCIOUS:
None taken.

00:59.327 --> 01:01.429
Um, we're ready.

01:01.462 --> 01:03.097
JAMAL:
All right, Ma,

01:03.131 --> 01:04.932
we got Chef Rahim here,

01:04.965 --> 01:07.401
who has made you the healthiest

01:07.435 --> 01:09.103
vegan Cajun soul food.

01:09.137 --> 01:11.539
Yeah, well, one of them words
don't belong in a sentence

01:11.572 --> 01:13.274
with the other words,
but whatever.

01:13.307 --> 01:15.543
LUCIOUS:
Honey, I have something for you.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.711
What is this now?

01:17.745 --> 01:19.880
It's a fitness bracelet.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.215
What it does is it monitors

01:21.249 --> 01:23.050
your heart rate,
your blood pressure.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.153
If you get too excited,
an alarm will go off

01:25.186 --> 01:28.156
and, via an app,
it will alert both our phones.

01:28.189 --> 01:30.124
-Okay?
-Mm. So, basically,

01:30.158 --> 01:32.726
it's a fancy ankle monitor.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.295
I'm on house arrest. Lord.

01:34.328 --> 01:36.997
You're on love arrest
until you get better.

01:37.030 --> 01:38.999
JUANITA:
Delivery.

01:39.032 --> 01:42.136
From Mr. Eddie Barker.

01:44.872 --> 01:47.808
Eddie wants us to know that he's

01:47.841 --> 01:50.611
sincerely apologetic
for his outburst.

01:50.644 --> 01:53.481
-Yeah, he got to be embarrassed.
-Was it that bad?

01:53.514 --> 01:55.249
I thought he was gonna stroke
out on the floor over there.

01:55.283 --> 01:58.018
Think about it-- before we
roped him into all our mess,

01:58.051 --> 01:59.653
he was retired,

01:59.687 --> 02:02.256
on the golf course,
counting his money.

02:02.290 --> 02:05.025
Now, who knows,
maybe he just got overzealous.

02:05.058 --> 02:06.994
-Well...
-How you like
your breakfast, Ma?

02:07.027 --> 02:09.463
I don't know how he did it.
This is good.

02:09.497 --> 02:12.300
-Yeah.
-See, told you some good
might come out of all this.

02:12.333 --> 02:13.767
When's the last time
we all sat down

02:13.801 --> 02:15.135
and ate some breakfast together?

02:15.169 --> 02:16.970
COOKIE:
We? All of us ain't here.

02:17.004 --> 02:18.872
-Where's Andre?
-Told him not to come.

02:18.906 --> 02:21.342
Right.
So I don't get to see my son

02:21.375 --> 02:23.143
'cause you don't want him here.

02:23.177 --> 02:24.845
He tried to kill me, Cookie.

02:24.878 --> 02:26.947
Hey, you know what, Lucious?
I hate to break it to you,

02:26.980 --> 02:30.184
but everybody at this table,
at one point, wanted you dead.

02:33.020 --> 02:36.357
Look, I... I know
you're doing all of this

02:36.390 --> 02:37.958
'cause you love me,

02:37.991 --> 02:39.627
but if you really want
to heal my heart, Lucious,

02:39.660 --> 02:41.629
please talk to Andre.

02:41.662 --> 02:44.131
Please give him a chance.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.165
Okay?

02:49.002 --> 02:50.571
* We play the game *

02:50.604 --> 02:53.006
* Every time where nobody *

02:53.040 --> 02:54.908
-Keep it sexy. Keep it sexy.
-* Wanting to say *

02:54.942 --> 02:56.544
* But I'm thinking that *

02:56.577 --> 02:57.711
* Maybe it's time *

02:57.745 --> 03:00.147
* For a change, for you and I *

03:00.180 --> 03:01.949
CHOREOGRAPHER:
Let's go.

03:03.717 --> 03:05.085
Hey.

03:05.118 --> 03:06.754
* Pull me, pull me closer *

03:08.422 --> 03:11.259
-* Love me till it's over *
-Milk it.

03:11.292 --> 03:12.893
* Stay with me
right by my side *

03:12.926 --> 03:14.895
* And we'll make it,
we'll make tonight *

03:14.928 --> 03:15.896
* Unforgettable *

03:15.929 --> 03:18.266
Let's go. Hey.

03:18.299 --> 03:20.868
* Unforgettable *

03:20.901 --> 03:23.103
-Clean up. Clean up.
-* I wanted this *

03:23.136 --> 03:25.005
* For so long *

03:25.038 --> 03:27.074
-Right here.
-* Let's make tonight
unforgettable... *

03:27.107 --> 03:28.676
Y'all keep rushing the song.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.043
Why do you keep rushing?

03:30.077 --> 03:31.078
WOMAN:
Sorry, T.

03:31.111 --> 03:32.580
Thought we were on point.

03:32.613 --> 03:34.748
Well, obviously, you weren't.

03:34.782 --> 03:36.016
Look, T, if you just stop

03:36.049 --> 03:37.685
skipping a beat,
they'd be on point.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.953
No, no. Controlling them
is your job, right?

03:39.987 --> 03:42.189
If not, then why are you here?

03:42.222 --> 03:43.757
(scoffs) You know what?
Let's just take five.

03:43.791 --> 03:45.659
Come on, ladies.

03:46.827 --> 03:48.729
What's up?

03:48.762 --> 03:50.898
Oh... Look, I know
you're going through a lot,

03:50.931 --> 03:53.701
but every time you come in,
I can't keep getting sidetracked

03:53.734 --> 03:55.803
when you need a shoulder
to cry on. I'm sorry.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.305
Ain't no tears here, mama.

03:57.338 --> 03:58.806
And get it right.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.274
I'm here to rehearse.

04:01.275 --> 04:02.943
So go ahead and move along.

04:02.976 --> 04:06.880
Actually, you-you're not on the
schedule today, Hakeem.

04:06.914 --> 04:09.883
-I don't reserve spaces we own.
-Of course you don't.

04:09.917 --> 04:12.586
Yet, and still,
we have reserved this space,

04:12.620 --> 04:15.155
so I'm gonna need you guys
to go, because we are having

04:15.188 --> 04:16.790
a super intense rehear... Hey!

04:16.824 --> 04:19.159
Excuse me! Off the snacks.
Come on.

04:19.192 --> 04:21.128
-Come on, let me walk y'all out.
-This ain't gonna work.

04:21.161 --> 04:22.296
Come on, let's go.

04:22.330 --> 04:23.964
Have a good night.
All of the cupcakes?

04:23.997 --> 04:26.266
-Thank you.
-Selfish.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.469
-Where you finna go?
-Ask her.

04:28.502 --> 04:30.438
What?

04:30.471 --> 04:32.873
She's useless, so I fired her.

04:37.611 --> 04:38.812
-(doorbell rings)
-NEWSMAN:
...families and survivors

04:38.846 --> 04:40.113
of the tragic mass shooting.

04:40.147 --> 04:42.416
The president has been
petitioned to meet with...

04:42.450 --> 04:43.751
Porsha, Miss Cookie.

04:43.784 --> 04:46.854
Ooh! Oh, thank you.

04:46.887 --> 04:48.922
I thought I was gonna have to
watch the news all day.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.425
Child, this news is depressing.

04:51.459 --> 04:53.994
-(TV turns off)
-What you got for me, huh?

04:54.027 --> 04:55.696
Got some 20 For 20 info for me?

04:55.729 --> 04:57.931
-What about Becky's A&R budget?
-I'm not supposed to

04:57.965 --> 04:59.199
bring you anything
dealing with business.

04:59.232 --> 05:01.001
That's Lucious' orders.

05:01.034 --> 05:04.538
You know what stresses me out?
Not being at Empire.

05:04.572 --> 05:06.840
I brought you some messages.

05:06.874 --> 05:09.176
Bey and J sent get well wishes,
and some chick named Asia

05:09.209 --> 05:10.878
been blowing up the phone
since you got sick.

05:10.911 --> 05:13.981
It don't say Asia, stupid.
It says Chyna.

05:14.014 --> 05:17.685
Chyna. That's what I said.

05:17.718 --> 05:19.553
She been calling every day.
Who the hell is she?

05:19.587 --> 05:21.722
We were in prison together.

05:21.755 --> 05:23.657
Oh. She wants to see you.

05:23.691 --> 05:27.961
Damn. I haven't talked to Chyna
since we got out.

05:27.995 --> 05:31.164
Well, I'll tell her
you ain't up for it.

05:31.198 --> 05:33.901
No. Call her back.

05:33.934 --> 05:35.335
Tell her I'm sending a car.

05:35.369 --> 05:37.037
-You sure?
-Mm-hmm.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.271
Okay.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.178
-Everything's starting to look
so dated now.
-Pop?

05:45.212 --> 05:48.482
-Mm-hmm.
-Pop. I need you to
take a look at this.

05:48.516 --> 05:50.083
It's your problem, man, now.

05:50.117 --> 05:51.752
You're the one who taught me
to follow my instincts.

05:51.785 --> 05:53.053
Now, ever since Eddie lost it,

05:53.086 --> 05:55.589
my instincts have been
screaming at me.

05:55.623 --> 05:58.225
He flipped out specifically
because his deal fell apart,

05:58.258 --> 06:00.461
like he personally stood
to lose, Pop.

06:03.631 --> 06:06.567
Six entities bought Empire stock
just before,

06:06.600 --> 06:08.235
when Eddie thought we were going
to announce his plan

06:08.268 --> 06:10.203
to sell Empire to Kelly Patel.

06:10.237 --> 06:12.440
Each company bought just enough
shares so that they would remain

06:12.473 --> 06:14.241
under the SEC threshold.

06:14.274 --> 06:16.109
We are a globally
traded company.

06:16.143 --> 06:18.278
Everybody buys and sells
Empire stock.

06:18.311 --> 06:20.247
That's true, Pop, true.

06:20.280 --> 06:23.283
But if the companies
were somehow connected,

06:23.316 --> 06:25.352
someone would've made
hundreds of millions

06:25.385 --> 06:26.954
on the stock valuation alone.

06:35.262 --> 06:39.032
And your instinct
says that Eddie is behind this?

06:39.066 --> 06:40.834
I know I'm right.

06:44.772 --> 06:45.906
Prove it.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.411
*

07:00.921 --> 07:02.255
Hmm.

07:04.792 --> 07:07.427
She Dragon Holdings,
Incorporated.

07:09.930 --> 07:12.232
They bought enough stock
to walk away with $15 million

07:12.265 --> 07:13.567
if Eddie's deal went through.

07:13.601 --> 07:14.968
You know the company?

07:15.002 --> 07:16.737
That's a name
that Eddie used to call his,

07:16.770 --> 07:19.940
um, second ex-wife, Celeste.

07:19.973 --> 07:23.243
She Dragon.
Okay, what about, uh...

07:23.276 --> 07:26.246
Blue-Z Ventures?

07:26.279 --> 07:28.516
You're kidding me.

07:28.549 --> 07:31.318
That was a corny quote

07:31.351 --> 07:33.286
from one of Eddie's
favorite films.

07:33.320 --> 07:36.824
He used to say,
"It's a bluesy adventure."

07:36.857 --> 07:39.459
(sighs) That's two buyers
with a link to Eddie, Pop.

07:39.493 --> 07:41.328
That's no coincidence.

07:41.361 --> 07:43.597
(sighs) I don't know, man.

07:43.631 --> 07:46.366
Eddie has enough money.

07:46.399 --> 07:49.202
I mean, why does he want to
screw me over?

07:49.236 --> 07:51.672
Let's ask Celeste.

07:51.705 --> 07:53.707
The She Dragon.

07:57.477 --> 08:00.781
I am so proud of you.

08:00.814 --> 08:03.116
I mean, all of us
back there are.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.719
I'm in here with you and them.

08:06.554 --> 08:08.221
Ooh.

08:08.255 --> 08:09.690
Uh, I got this. Thank you.

08:09.723 --> 08:12.025
(clears throat)

08:13.594 --> 08:14.728
You know, Chyna,

08:14.762 --> 08:17.665
I know you think I forgot
about you guys,

08:17.698 --> 08:19.432
but it's really not like that.

08:22.035 --> 08:25.072
I wouldn't have survived if it
weren't for you and the crew.

08:25.105 --> 08:27.474
Yeah, well, sometimes
it's just easier to

08:27.507 --> 08:29.509
not deal with life
on the inside.

08:29.543 --> 08:30.578
Yeah.
(laughs)

08:30.611 --> 08:33.246
We spent all those nights

08:33.280 --> 08:35.382
dreaming about getting out.

08:35.415 --> 08:37.685
God...

08:37.718 --> 08:40.220
Never really realizing
how hard it'll be.

08:40.253 --> 08:44.558
Mm. And no one on the outside,
like, gets you. You know?

08:44.592 --> 08:47.360
-Hmm.
-I mean, I was so used to
being on guard 24/7.

08:47.394 --> 08:49.529
You dis me, hey, we gonna fight.
(laughs)

08:49.563 --> 08:51.865
Yeah, you better calm it down,

08:51.899 --> 08:55.368
'cause one false move, they
throw your ass right back in.

08:55.402 --> 08:58.839
You remember how we used to bet
on how long chicks

08:58.872 --> 09:00.407
would be making it
on the outside?

09:00.440 --> 09:04.878
Man, I used to hate seeing them
sad faces walk back in.

09:04.912 --> 09:08.048
Well, I think the mama
was a psycho.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.783
Anybody that do this
to they own child...

09:09.817 --> 09:11.218
Yeah, well, at least
she ain't kill her.

09:11.251 --> 09:14.021
-She tried to.
-No, the mama was sick.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.623
-She had her own pain.
-Hmm.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.224
True, but still...

09:17.257 --> 09:18.558
pain makes people
do crazy things.

09:18.592 --> 09:21.929
Oh, look who's back.

09:21.962 --> 09:23.897
Five years gone,
and I still knew

09:23.931 --> 09:26.466
this bitch would end up
right back in here.

09:26.499 --> 09:28.368
Can I talk to you, Cookie?

09:28.401 --> 09:30.037
After you had me thrown in hell

09:30.070 --> 09:31.404
for your
"get out of jail free" card?

09:31.438 --> 09:33.907
-You got the wrong bitch.
-(drops book)

09:33.941 --> 09:36.209
Uh-uh. Ain't nobody getting
no write-ups today.

09:36.243 --> 09:37.477
Move on, Poundcake. Come on.

09:37.510 --> 09:38.879
Yeah, move on, Poundcake.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.882
Ain't nobody getting
written up today.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.951
I ain't messing with you,
Poundcake. You a snitch.

09:43.984 --> 09:45.052
Sit down.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.754
We reading the Bible next time,

09:46.787 --> 09:48.455
'cause y'all acting crazy.

09:48.488 --> 09:50.290
-What page are we on?
-ALL: 89.

09:50.323 --> 09:54.728
-89. Like I said,
the mama is crazy.
-Right.

09:54.762 --> 09:57.998
Poundcake still on the inside?

09:58.031 --> 10:01.001
Uh, yeah, she's still locked up.

10:01.034 --> 10:03.671
But I heard she was in hospice.

10:03.704 --> 10:07.775
Hospice? (chuckles)
What's wrong with her?

10:07.808 --> 10:09.309
Cancer.

10:11.478 --> 10:13.546
It's bad.

10:15.348 --> 10:18.551
But maybe she finally getting
what she deserved.

10:21.655 --> 10:24.291
* No more crying now *

10:24.324 --> 10:28.095
* They think our picture
is broken *

10:28.128 --> 10:30.430
* But maybe it was
out of focus *

10:30.463 --> 10:32.599
* They don't know we're gold *

10:32.632 --> 10:34.467
* They don't know
we're gold, go. *

10:34.501 --> 10:35.635
(music stops)

10:35.669 --> 10:37.537
Becky, come on.

10:37.570 --> 10:39.940
Literally, first of all,
the fans will love it.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.942
It's unexpected,
it's unapologetic.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.176
It's that new stuff.
You know what I'm saying?

10:43.210 --> 10:44.177
That's what we need.

10:44.211 --> 10:45.312
You are a true artist,

10:45.345 --> 10:48.281
and we are 100% behind you.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.350
-Thanks, y'all.
-However,

10:50.383 --> 10:53.821
we've been doing some testing,
and your fans feel differently.

10:53.854 --> 10:56.489
Testing?

10:56.523 --> 10:57.991
That's what we doing
around here now?

10:58.025 --> 10:59.359
Well, yeah, we've been testing

10:59.392 --> 11:01.528
some of our 20 For 20 releases,

11:01.561 --> 11:05.465
and that is just a bit
of feedback from them.

11:05.498 --> 11:08.068
"Angry Jamal's killing my vibe."

11:08.101 --> 11:10.637
"Who does Jamal Lyon think
he is, Migos?"

11:10.670 --> 11:13.006
This is stupid. These-these are
obviously just trolls.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.975
-Y'all know that.
-All right, but, Jamal,

11:15.008 --> 11:17.377
this bad boy narrative
is on you.

11:17.410 --> 11:20.380
It's the Warren situation,
Angelo, Robin Roberts.

11:20.413 --> 11:22.682
This sort of behavior,

11:22.716 --> 11:25.585
along with this new sound,
is just...

11:25.618 --> 11:29.189
it's not what your fans
expect or want from you.

11:29.222 --> 11:31.158
What they expect.
Okay, well-well,

11:31.191 --> 11:33.360
whatever's happening
outside of the studio, though,

11:33.393 --> 11:35.528
is not the narrative
that I'm selling. The music is.

11:35.562 --> 11:37.030
-I know.
-I guarantee you if y'all

11:37.064 --> 11:38.932
pull together, do your job,

11:38.966 --> 11:41.001
do it right,
you'll sell the record.

11:41.034 --> 11:44.237
Mm. I got to do my job.

11:44.271 --> 11:46.606
Okay, look, I'm feeling
the verses, but the hook

11:46.639 --> 11:49.109
needs a little work, so we're
gonna loop the track, let you

11:49.142 --> 11:50.610
-work it out for a minute.
All right.
-Okay.

11:50.643 --> 11:52.245
You can take five.

11:52.279 --> 11:53.580
(sighs)
You were right, man.

11:53.613 --> 11:54.915
I'm always right.

11:54.948 --> 11:56.416
What about now?

11:56.449 --> 11:58.385
I've been letting
all that Tiana stuff

11:58.418 --> 12:00.788
plus the whole thing
with my mom get to me.

12:00.821 --> 12:02.956
I got to focus on my music.

12:02.990 --> 12:05.692
So hook me up with
some bomb-ass beats, Shine.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.961
Smart man. I got you.

12:07.995 --> 12:09.562
But I need one thing from you.

12:09.596 --> 12:11.564
Young gun in there--

12:11.598 --> 12:12.800
he could use a little
peer mentorship,

12:12.833 --> 12:15.402
help learn the ropes
of the game.

12:15.435 --> 12:18.405
There's not a white boy in the
world that needs help from me.

12:18.438 --> 12:22.209
My mom and dad
taught me that much.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.744
Blake's from Chicago.
He's the real deal.

12:24.778 --> 12:26.479
Being from the Chi
and looking like him

12:26.513 --> 12:28.916
ain't the same as being from
the Chi and looking like me.

12:28.949 --> 12:31.584
-Lucious and Cookie
taught me that, too.
-(chuckles)

12:31.618 --> 12:34.254
He wasn't raised by a Lucious.
Or even a Cookie.

12:34.287 --> 12:35.755
The streets raised him.

12:35.789 --> 12:37.724
See them tats?

12:37.757 --> 12:39.592
It's to cover up
three bullet holes.

12:39.626 --> 12:42.229
He says music
is gonna save his life.

12:42.262 --> 12:45.332
For the record, I don't
deal with no culture vultures.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.500
The boy can spit.

12:50.503 --> 12:52.840
You know, he's a fan of yours,
by the way.

12:52.873 --> 12:54.842
(chuckles)
I got a lot of fans.

12:54.875 --> 12:57.577
Let somebody else save his life.
You know what, man,

12:57.610 --> 13:00.280
forget helping me out
with those tracks.

13:00.313 --> 13:02.782
I'll do it on my own.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.457
*

13:11.391 --> 13:13.393
(Cookie sighs)

13:17.697 --> 13:19.967
Uh, excuse me.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.435
I'm Cookie Lyon,
and I am here to see

13:22.469 --> 13:25.138
my good friend,
uh, Sara Lee Williams.

13:25.172 --> 13:26.606
Well, I call her...

13:26.639 --> 13:28.608
Poundcake.
Yes, she knows you're here.

13:28.641 --> 13:29.877
We'll just be
a few more minutes.

13:29.910 --> 13:30.978
Okay.

13:33.013 --> 13:35.015
(sighs)

13:49.863 --> 13:51.865
-Gin.
-Again?

13:51.899 --> 13:54.467
-Again.
-I don't know how,
but you's over there cheating.

13:54.501 --> 13:57.537
No cheating.
Just age and wisdom, baby.

13:57.570 --> 13:58.906
Age and wisdom.

13:58.939 --> 14:00.707
Um, Ruth, can I
talk to Cookie, please?

14:00.740 --> 14:04.544
-Why you asking her?
-I'm asking her to step away...

14:04.577 --> 14:06.179
Okay, listen.

14:06.213 --> 14:08.715
I need to talk to you
in private.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.586
Mm.

14:13.620 --> 14:14.955
Thank you.

14:19.626 --> 14:21.361
Listen, um...

14:21.394 --> 14:23.663
you have every right
to be mad at me.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.865
Mad don't even begin
to measure it.

14:25.899 --> 14:28.601
I had to find my baby, Cookie.

14:28.635 --> 14:31.538
Because every minute
that she's out there

14:31.571 --> 14:33.240
and I'm in here, it feels like

14:33.273 --> 14:35.875
she's getting
further and further away.

14:35.909 --> 14:37.877
Now, I-I'm... I'm...

14:37.911 --> 14:41.114
I'm sorry that you got hurt.

14:41.148 --> 14:44.617
Really, truly sorry.

14:44.651 --> 14:47.420
But if I'm honest
with you, Cookie,

14:47.454 --> 14:50.223
I'd kill everybody in here

14:50.257 --> 14:52.825
if it helped me
get my baby girl back.

14:54.227 --> 14:55.862
You caused a lot of pain,
Poundcake,

14:55.895 --> 14:58.966
to a lot of people.

14:58.999 --> 15:01.468
But I understand that beat about

15:01.501 --> 15:03.503
doing what you got to do
for your family.

15:06.073 --> 15:08.075
Five minutes, ladies.

15:11.278 --> 15:14.047
I spent five years out there

15:14.081 --> 15:16.049
looking for my little girl,

15:16.083 --> 15:19.319
and the one thing
I know for sure

15:19.352 --> 15:21.421
is that that bastard

15:21.454 --> 15:23.790
made my baby disappear.

15:46.013 --> 15:47.247
Hey.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.949
What the hell you doing here?

15:49.983 --> 15:53.086
Remember, you promised me
you'd never look back.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.354
(chuckles softly)

15:54.387 --> 15:56.523
-You look good, Cake.
-(chuckles weakly)

15:56.556 --> 15:58.958
My Lord. Well...

15:58.992 --> 16:02.429
if you startin' to lie to me,
then I know it's bad.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.464
(chuckles)

16:10.070 --> 16:11.604
Mm-mm.

16:11.638 --> 16:14.507
Stop staring at me
with those sad eyes.

16:16.343 --> 16:19.346
Tell me some good news.
(grunts softly)

16:19.379 --> 16:20.847
Hmm?

16:20.880 --> 16:22.649
Tell me about
that glamorous life of yours.

16:22.682 --> 16:24.851
(clicks tongue)
Oh, please-- it ain't all that.

16:24.884 --> 16:27.454
-(laughs)
-No? So Ebony,

16:27.487 --> 16:29.122
Essence and Jet--

16:29.156 --> 16:31.391
they just lyin'
on your life, huh?

16:31.424 --> 16:34.561
(both laugh)

16:34.594 --> 16:36.729
How are your boys doing?

16:36.763 --> 16:38.231
Uh, they are great.

16:38.265 --> 16:40.900
I mean, I'm-I'm just
thankful to God

16:40.933 --> 16:43.203
that they are all alive
and they're with me.

16:43.236 --> 16:45.705
-Mm-hmm.
-You know, but my oldest, Andre,

16:45.738 --> 16:47.140
(laughing):
I-I can't...

16:47.174 --> 16:48.675
I can't even
get into that, but...

16:48.708 --> 16:51.244
Listen, whatever's going on,

16:51.278 --> 16:53.846
you remember
that you are blessed,

16:53.880 --> 16:56.416
because you have them with you.

16:58.185 --> 17:00.920
I think about my little girl
every day.

17:00.953 --> 17:02.889
I'm sorry, Poundcake.

17:02.922 --> 17:05.392
You still haven't
found her, huh?

17:05.425 --> 17:08.395
No.

17:08.428 --> 17:13.166
She's probably
in college right now.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.401
Mm-hmm.

17:14.434 --> 17:17.036
I like to tell myself

17:17.070 --> 17:20.207
that she wants to be a doctor

17:20.240 --> 17:22.442
or a lawyer.

17:22.475 --> 17:25.245
Or maybe, she might
even want to do computers.

17:25.278 --> 17:26.579
(sniffles)

17:26.613 --> 17:29.282
Yeah. I could, uh,

17:29.316 --> 17:30.783
I could see that.

17:30.817 --> 17:32.285
Mm-hmm.

17:32.319 --> 17:34.387
What else is she up to?

17:34.421 --> 17:37.390
She dating this boy right now.

17:37.424 --> 17:41.361
Mm-hmm, and he... he cute.

17:41.394 --> 17:42.862
Not too cute, you know.

17:42.895 --> 17:45.432
-Mm-hmm.
-He's smart,

17:45.465 --> 17:47.300
and he's real good to her.

17:47.334 --> 17:50.370
You know what? Hell,
maybe she's dating a chick.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.472
(both laugh)

17:52.505 --> 17:56.143
You know, I-I would
be okay with that.

17:56.176 --> 17:57.744
-(laughs)
-Hmm.

17:57.777 --> 18:00.780
'Cause I know
that she got my spirit.

18:00.813 --> 18:02.615
Yes, I know that.

18:02.649 --> 18:06.486
Yeah, she won't
put up with no mess.

18:06.519 --> 18:07.787
Mm.

18:07.820 --> 18:09.822
(sniffles)

18:12.459 --> 18:14.761
-(crying): We've been through
hell, haven't we?
-Yes.

18:14.794 --> 18:17.330
We have, Poundcake.

18:19.199 --> 18:21.668
This is not right,

18:21.701 --> 18:24.471
you laid up here like this.

18:24.504 --> 18:26.473
And your baby girl is out there;

18:26.506 --> 18:29.609
she don't know that you didn't
want to give her up.

18:29.642 --> 18:32.645
She don't know
how much you love her.

18:32.679 --> 18:34.981
(Cookie exhales)

18:36.516 --> 18:40.353
Poundcake.

18:40.387 --> 18:43.356
I'm-a find your baby girl.

18:43.390 --> 18:46.593
I'm gonna find her,
and I'm-a bring her here.

18:46.626 --> 18:47.827
Okay?

18:47.860 --> 18:49.462
So you can see her.

18:49.496 --> 18:50.863
Okay?

18:50.897 --> 18:53.900
O-Okay.

19:00.473 --> 19:04.211
(instrumental beat playing)

19:04.244 --> 19:05.978
(Blake clears throat)

19:06.012 --> 19:08.448
Yo. Sorry to interrupt.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.383
(music stops)

19:10.417 --> 19:12.185
But you're doing it anyway.

19:12.219 --> 19:13.320
What's up?

19:13.353 --> 19:15.788
I heard, uh,

19:15.822 --> 19:18.024
Shine kind of took a heavy hand
on the whole mentor thing,

19:18.057 --> 19:20.693
and I just wanted to let
you know, it wasn't my idea.

19:20.727 --> 19:22.562
I mean... (scoffs)
don't get me wrong.

19:22.595 --> 19:25.865
I respect you, and I know
it'd be a dope opportunity.

19:25.898 --> 19:28.301
Don't worry about it.

19:28.335 --> 19:30.403
(instrumental beat playing)

19:31.438 --> 19:33.973
Yo, is-is this you?

19:34.006 --> 19:35.675
Yeah.

19:35.708 --> 19:37.176
It's nice.

19:37.210 --> 19:38.511
Kind of reminds me of, uh,

19:38.545 --> 19:40.747
"Bread Winner,"

19:40.780 --> 19:44.484
off one of your early mixtapes,
Birth of the Young Lyon? Right?

19:44.517 --> 19:46.219
That's what I'm going for.

19:46.253 --> 19:48.020
Word.
(chuckles)

19:48.054 --> 19:50.923
* Heat seeker, you need fire,
I keep heaters. *

19:50.957 --> 19:52.992
(both laugh)

19:53.025 --> 19:55.027
Yo, uh, I must've played

19:55.061 --> 19:57.830
that song like, over and over
and over and over and over again

19:57.864 --> 19:59.766
when I first heard it, man.

19:59.799 --> 20:01.668
I think it actually,
uh, blew out my speakers.

20:01.701 --> 20:02.902
The bass, you know?

20:04.136 --> 20:05.872
Hey, what's your name?

20:05.905 --> 20:06.873
Blake.

20:06.906 --> 20:09.376
Blake. Memorizing the song

20:09.409 --> 20:10.443
is one thing.

20:10.477 --> 20:12.245
Spitting your own bars

20:12.279 --> 20:13.580
is another.

20:13.613 --> 20:14.881
Right.

20:14.914 --> 20:16.283
I got to get back to work.

20:16.316 --> 20:17.450
Ah, yeah, yeah.

20:17.484 --> 20:19.151
Cool, man.

20:25.392 --> 20:27.794
* Lord forgive
what I'm prepared to do *

20:27.827 --> 20:30.763
* But if you look me in my eyes,
you can see there's a zoo *

20:30.797 --> 20:33.099
* I mean, I guess growing up
in your beach chair is cool *

20:33.132 --> 20:35.935
* Until a white boy got
more street cred than you *

20:35.968 --> 20:38.605
* You can hear my hunger pains
if we clash for fame *

20:38.638 --> 20:41.474
* The type to chop your head off
just to snatch your chain *

20:41.508 --> 20:42.875
* Hold up,
he think he got the sauce *

20:42.909 --> 20:44.143
* Oh, he think
he swagging on me *

20:44.176 --> 20:45.378
* Well, I pack enough shells *

20:45.412 --> 20:46.946
* To turn your sauce
to ravioli *

20:46.979 --> 20:48.648
* Got to habit
to have it on me *

20:48.681 --> 20:50.216
* It's magic,
like pulling rabbits *

20:50.249 --> 20:51.618
* From hats,
I'm a hazard, homie *

20:51.651 --> 20:53.320
* Had a tragic
and drastic lonely past *

20:53.353 --> 20:55.288
* But now I got
these guys all stressed *

20:55.322 --> 20:58.458
* 'Cause I'm coming
to collect like the IRS... *

21:06.333 --> 21:10.236
* I'm a Lyon, you just lying
under oath, that's perjury *

21:10.269 --> 21:11.638
* All these diamonds
cut around my neck *

21:11.671 --> 21:13.340
* I need surgery, emergency *

21:13.373 --> 21:15.642
* I'm-a put this man
in the dirt *

21:15.675 --> 21:17.477
* You just a white boy lost,
that's an AMBER Alert *

21:17.510 --> 21:19.346
-Ugh.
-* Okay, these next
couple words *

21:19.379 --> 21:21.147
* May be very unfamiliar *

21:21.180 --> 21:23.483
* Cash, coins, guap, money,
moola, scratch, skrilla *

21:23.516 --> 21:26.252
-Okay.
-* I'm fresh, cool and fly,
jets to Dubai *

21:26.285 --> 21:29.288
-* You belong in a cubicle with
dress shoes and ties *
-Damn.

21:29.322 --> 21:31.658
* You run around saying
you the best, who am I? *

21:31.691 --> 21:34.327
* If I don't put you on the
guest list, yes, you denied *

21:34.361 --> 21:37.364
* I'm the ruler, I'm the heir,
the prince of Zamunda *

21:37.397 --> 21:38.631
* This a chest
full of treasures *

21:38.665 --> 21:39.832
* Verse a cooler full of beers *

21:39.866 --> 21:41.468
* What's up? *

21:41.501 --> 21:43.703
* Okay, I'm going to the top *

21:43.736 --> 21:45.638
* I'm-a never stop *

21:45.672 --> 21:47.173
* Plus, you got the swag *

21:47.206 --> 21:49.942
* Of an undercover cop,
or a plumber or an opp *

21:49.976 --> 21:51.678
* The dude from Dumb and Dumber,
hold up *

21:51.711 --> 21:53.780
* No wonder you got
the floor covered, you a mop *

21:53.813 --> 21:56.883
* Stop, how you think
we even see even *

21:56.916 --> 21:59.218
* You got your whole style
from a BET season *

21:59.251 --> 22:00.787
* How you pitiful and sloppy *

22:00.820 --> 22:02.722
* Miserable and cocky *

22:02.755 --> 22:04.991
* And I'm what separates
the original from copies *

22:05.024 --> 22:06.959
* Watch me, meditate, levitate *

22:06.993 --> 22:08.695
* You a featherweight,
you was never great *

22:08.728 --> 22:10.997
I'm a heavyweight, if you
hesitate, I'm-a educate *

22:11.030 --> 22:12.298
* You a minute man,
just a second late *

22:12.331 --> 22:14.000
* My crown is a heavy weight *

22:14.033 --> 22:15.201
* If you put it on,
your whole neck will break *

22:15.234 --> 22:16.736
* And I got next,
I expect the hate. *

22:20.239 --> 22:23.676
Let's mess with this beat
and see what happens.

22:23.710 --> 22:26.913
That's what's up.
Let's do it.

22:26.946 --> 22:29.882
ANDRE:
Okay, thank you very much.

22:29.916 --> 22:32.385
Celeste is at her tennis club.

22:33.620 --> 22:35.488
Why are you doing this?

22:35.522 --> 22:37.590
You can't possibly think
that this is gonna

22:37.624 --> 22:39.859
get you back in with me.

22:39.892 --> 22:43.062
Pop, you and I may have
our differences, okay?

22:43.095 --> 22:46.566
But an attack on Empire is
an attack on our entire family.

22:46.599 --> 22:48.635
So now you about family?

22:50.302 --> 22:52.505
(app beeping)

22:52.539 --> 22:54.941
Really?

22:54.974 --> 22:57.410
Got you.

22:57.444 --> 23:01.180
Okay, okay, so that rat bastard
Burleson lives in Wood Haven?

23:01.213 --> 23:04.350
-Text me the address. Thirst...
-(phone vibrates)

23:04.383 --> 23:06.453
Uh, Thirsty,
let me call you back.

23:06.486 --> 23:08.621
Hello, Lucious.

23:08.655 --> 23:10.289
-What's up?
-Your blood pressure,

23:10.322 --> 23:11.691
that's what's up.
What are you doing?

23:11.724 --> 23:13.092
You running laps?

23:13.125 --> 23:15.094
No, look, I got upset.

23:15.127 --> 23:17.764
All right? That bitch Trump
is tweeting again.

23:17.797 --> 23:19.131
How did you know...

23:19.165 --> 23:20.567
It's called technology, baby.

23:20.600 --> 23:21.934
This watch?

23:21.968 --> 23:23.636
Look, I need you to sit down,

23:23.670 --> 23:25.037
put your feet up.

23:25.071 --> 23:26.639
Matter of fact, where's Porsha?

23:26.673 --> 23:29.576
Porsha? Well, you know,
I sent her out

23:29.609 --> 23:32.078
to get me some more tofu.
Look,

23:32.111 --> 23:34.280
I'm gonna put my legs up
right now as we speak.

23:34.313 --> 23:36.082
I'm sitting down, okay?
I'll text you later.

23:36.115 --> 23:37.316
All right, bye-bye.

23:37.349 --> 23:41.588
I can't have this watch
snitching on me.

23:41.621 --> 23:45.091
-(phone vibrates)
-Yes, Lucious?

23:45.124 --> 23:47.126
-Put it back on.
-How did you even...

23:47.159 --> 23:48.394
Well, either you took it off

23:48.427 --> 23:49.629
or you just died.

23:49.662 --> 23:51.531
Now, I need you
to put it back on.

23:55.001 --> 23:56.335
(Porsha chuckles)

23:56.368 --> 23:57.804
Busted.

23:57.837 --> 23:59.506
Shut your ass up

23:59.539 --> 24:01.273
and get Thirsty back
on the line for me.

24:01.307 --> 24:03.175
Treat me like I'm a criminal.

24:05.377 --> 24:07.413
(chuckles)

24:07.446 --> 24:11.350
Okay, so here are the sketches
for the album.

24:11.383 --> 24:13.820
I love this for "Unforgettable."

24:13.853 --> 24:15.688
I'm thinking, like, the whole
Asian motif that we did before.

24:15.722 --> 24:17.857
Classy.

24:17.890 --> 24:20.627
You're the last person I need
up in my face right now.

24:20.660 --> 24:23.796
Yeah, which one? You seem to be
wearing a lot of them lately.

24:23.830 --> 24:26.933
Bye, bitch.

24:26.966 --> 24:30.603
It really is so sad,
the way you just let Eddie

24:30.637 --> 24:32.639
turn you into his little
Barbie Doll.

24:32.672 --> 24:36.308
Well, I don't see you giving
back the hits he gave you.

24:36.342 --> 24:37.777
(chuckles)

24:37.810 --> 24:40.379
You know what? I'm just trying
to help you, okay?

24:40.412 --> 24:43.783
The old Tiana was so confident.
And look at you now.

24:43.816 --> 24:45.718
Are you even happy with what
he's having you do?

24:45.752 --> 24:48.521
'Cause if so, then why is
everyone around you

24:48.555 --> 24:49.689
so miserable?

24:51.724 --> 24:54.794
You know what?
You can stay mad, Tory.

24:54.827 --> 24:56.863
I'm gonna be bigger
than you ever were.

24:56.896 --> 24:59.065
-(chuckles)
-And guess what.

24:59.098 --> 25:02.101
-I don't have to be high
to do it.
-(designer laughs)

25:06.939 --> 25:09.041
I love that one.

25:09.075 --> 25:10.710
(sighs)

25:14.113 --> 25:16.749
JAMAL:
You know this is boring. Like...

25:16.783 --> 25:19.018
are these songs supposed
to be awful?

25:19.051 --> 25:20.352
It wasn't that bad.

25:20.386 --> 25:22.922
With you on it, it's a safe bet.

25:22.955 --> 25:25.491
Let's end for today.

25:25.524 --> 25:27.760
Hey, uh, Jamal, I didn't mean
anything by that comment.

25:27.794 --> 25:29.228
I know you didn't, man.

25:29.261 --> 25:31.497
And we'll just,
we'll hit it hard tomorrow.

25:31.530 --> 25:32.799
Okay.

25:38.204 --> 25:40.406
TORY:
What was that all about?

25:40.439 --> 25:42.208
Becky and her team.

25:42.241 --> 25:43.509
Apparently,
the two and a half fans

25:43.542 --> 25:44.911
I actually still have left

25:44.944 --> 25:47.079
don't like the new music,
so I'm in here

25:47.113 --> 25:49.582
looking for inspiration, but
it's just the same old thing.

25:53.620 --> 25:57.189
* No more crying now,
they think our picture... *

25:57.223 --> 25:59.258
It's like, just let me
have this one song.

25:59.291 --> 26:01.293
You know what I'm saying?

26:01.327 --> 26:03.696
Like, I think this is it.

26:03.730 --> 26:06.733
I need a live audience
to really hear it.

26:06.766 --> 26:08.901
Well, maybe you just need
the right live audience.

26:08.935 --> 26:11.137
* Baby, we just need to
hold on. *

26:11.170 --> 26:13.439
-Okay, okay.
-When you come up...

26:13.472 --> 26:15.908
So we just need to know if Eddie
advised her to buy Empire stock.

26:15.942 --> 26:17.476
LUCIOUS: Well, just let me
do the talking,

26:17.509 --> 26:20.680
'cause, um, Celeste loves me.

26:22.448 --> 26:24.917
Ooh.

26:24.951 --> 26:27.920
That's an amazing form
you got there, as always.

26:27.954 --> 26:31.223
Lucious Lyon. Wow.

26:31.257 --> 26:34.493
Please tell me why I pay
exorbitant dues to this club

26:34.526 --> 26:36.829
when they let thugs
stroll right in here?

26:36.863 --> 26:39.899
Come on, Celeste.
I mean, how've you been?

26:39.932 --> 26:42.168
You mean, how did I make out

26:42.201 --> 26:43.970
after you introduced my husband

26:44.003 --> 26:47.173
to that slut Giselle while
he and I were still married?

26:47.206 --> 26:48.641
You know that I had no idea

26:48.675 --> 26:51.644
that Eddie and Giselle

26:51.678 --> 26:53.479
was gonna become a thing.

26:53.512 --> 26:56.182
Right.
What do you want, Lucious?

26:56.215 --> 26:58.517
I need to know
a couple things about, um,

26:58.550 --> 27:00.352
She Dragon.

27:00.386 --> 27:03.322
I don't have any idea
what you're talking about.

27:03.355 --> 27:07.026
Sweetheart, don't-don't...

27:07.059 --> 27:09.762
don't insult me, all right?

27:09.796 --> 27:13.199
If you think you can come
in here and strong-arm me

27:13.232 --> 27:16.135
into running my mouth
like I'm one of your rappers,

27:16.168 --> 27:19.005
you are sadly mistaken...

27:19.038 --> 27:21.240
sweetheart.

27:25.344 --> 27:26.445
-Okay.
-All right?

27:26.478 --> 27:27.579
-Yeah.
-Let's try another one.

27:33.219 --> 27:34.653
(grunts)

27:37.556 --> 27:39.625
-Right, right.
-LUCIOUS: I'm telling you,

27:39.658 --> 27:41.828
this is a waste of time.

27:41.861 --> 27:45.064
Well, I'll do the talking
this time.

27:47.666 --> 27:51.403
ANDRE:
Hello. Hi. Hi.

27:51.437 --> 27:53.840
Um, I think we might've gotten
off on the wrong foot.

27:53.873 --> 27:55.307
I apologize for that.
I'm Andre Lyon.

27:55.341 --> 27:58.244
I thought I recognized you.

27:58.277 --> 27:59.846
You're the smart Lyon cub.

27:59.879 --> 28:01.513
-Went to Wharton, right?
-That's right, that's right.

28:01.547 --> 28:03.149
I remember you, too.

28:03.182 --> 28:05.852
And might I say, you look
even more beautiful now.

28:05.885 --> 28:08.687
That sounds like one of your
daddy's tired lines.

28:08.721 --> 28:11.223
-You can go.
-We could.

28:11.257 --> 28:12.925
But we're here in the interest
of transparency,

28:12.959 --> 28:15.895
if indeed She Dragon
is your company.

28:15.928 --> 28:19.098
Armando, can you give us
a moment, please?

28:19.131 --> 28:20.499
Sure.

28:20.532 --> 28:22.234
Thank you, Armando.

28:23.469 --> 28:27.006
Transparency about what,
exactly?

28:27.039 --> 28:29.876
We know that Eddie promised
you'd make a lot of money

28:29.909 --> 28:31.844
from Empire's sale
to Kelly Patel.

28:31.878 --> 28:34.113
Unfortunately, that deal
is not happening.

28:34.146 --> 28:37.649
-Why not?
-Because we shut it down.

28:39.085 --> 28:40.953
Eddie said you were on board.

28:40.987 --> 28:42.388
That we'd all be richer
than God.

28:42.421 --> 28:43.689
Oh, don't worry, um,
we're positive

28:43.722 --> 28:45.691
that Eddie will
take good care of you.

28:45.724 --> 28:49.261
He did give you the same deal
points as Giselle, correct?

28:49.295 --> 28:51.363
What the hell does she
have to do with this?

28:51.397 --> 28:52.698
-Um...
-Yeah,

28:52.731 --> 28:54.733
that-that looks about right,
yeah, Pop?

28:57.403 --> 29:00.873
Um... yeah, I mean, Giselle,

29:00.907 --> 29:02.608
she's got the job at Empire.

29:02.641 --> 29:04.076
Oh, right.
So her-her salary's a bonus

29:04.110 --> 29:05.411
on top of her points, right?

29:05.444 --> 29:06.979
That bitch is getting a salary?

29:07.013 --> 29:09.281
-She's getting, like, $300.
-Uh, four, Pop.

29:09.315 --> 29:11.383
-Four?
-Four, $400,000.

29:11.417 --> 29:12.551
Plus her cut
of the clothing line.

29:12.584 --> 29:13.886
CELESTE:
Oh, hell no.

29:13.920 --> 29:17.389
That no-good son of a...

29:17.423 --> 29:20.292
Broke-ass loses all his money...

29:20.326 --> 29:22.294
-Whoa, lost his money?
-Everything.

29:22.328 --> 29:25.264
His, mine, the ex-wives.

29:25.297 --> 29:27.166
Everything we had was invested

29:27.199 --> 29:28.835
in Steve Lawrence's
Ponzi scheme.

29:28.868 --> 29:32.304
Eddie told me
to sell all my property,

29:32.338 --> 29:34.273
and buy up Empire stock.

29:37.043 --> 29:40.779
And this is how he plays me?
Come on.

29:47.219 --> 29:49.688
PORSHA: The way you talk
about this Burleson,

29:49.721 --> 29:50.857
you would think he live
in a castle

29:50.890 --> 29:52.258
in Transylvania or something.

29:52.291 --> 29:54.126
Just because you have
a nice house

29:54.160 --> 29:56.162
don't make you no less
of a monster.

29:56.195 --> 29:57.629
I thought you didn't even like
this Poundcake.

29:57.663 --> 29:59.131
Why you even going
out the way for her?

29:59.165 --> 30:01.868
We went through a lot
on the inside, okay?

30:01.901 --> 30:03.702
I owe her.

30:03.735 --> 30:05.371
You have no idea.

30:05.404 --> 30:06.538
What I do know:
Lucious gonna kill me

30:06.572 --> 30:08.607
for bringing you out here.

30:08.640 --> 30:09.876
-Give me your hand.
-What're you doing?

30:09.909 --> 30:11.677
What're you doing? Cookie!

30:11.710 --> 30:14.713
(stammers) What am I supposed
to do when he call me?

30:14.746 --> 30:16.448
Keep calm, and he won't call.

30:16.482 --> 30:18.317
Remember,

30:18.350 --> 30:20.786
nice, slow,
steady breaths, okay?

30:20.819 --> 30:21.787
Think happy thoughts.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.022
Pretend like you in the Bahamas.

30:23.055 --> 30:24.190
I don't know, child.

30:24.223 --> 30:25.224
The Bahamas?

30:31.163 --> 30:32.664
(knocking on door)

30:34.766 --> 30:38.570
Uh... (laughs)
Oh, my. You're...

30:38.604 --> 30:40.973
Yeah. Does Mr. Burleson
live here?

30:41.007 --> 30:42.975
BURLESON:
Who is it, Joyce?

30:43.009 --> 30:45.211
Yeah?

30:45.244 --> 30:46.979
(women shouting)

30:47.013 --> 30:48.347
Throw her in the hole.

30:48.380 --> 30:51.417
Holloway? Is that you?

30:51.450 --> 30:54.921
-Oh, my God, it is.
-(chuckling) Yeah.

30:54.954 --> 30:56.722
I can't believe it.

30:56.755 --> 30:57.990
After all these years.

30:58.024 --> 30:59.425
See, now, I told you
I wasn't lying.

30:59.458 --> 31:01.560
Well, come on.
Don't just stand there.

31:01.593 --> 31:02.594
-Come on in.
-Come on in.

31:07.566 --> 31:10.702
So, uh... what brings you here?

31:10.736 --> 31:12.704
You writing a book?
Y-You want an interview

31:12.738 --> 31:14.506
with me or something or...?

31:14.540 --> 31:18.077
It's a nice, uh, life
you have, Burleson.

31:18.110 --> 31:21.613
Bo, please.
Friends call me Bo.

31:21.647 --> 31:22.648
Hmm.

31:24.283 --> 31:25.517
What do your kids call you?

31:25.551 --> 31:26.919
Uh, we don't have any kids.

31:26.953 --> 31:29.455
JOYCE:
That's our one regret.

31:29.488 --> 31:31.457
I just never could get pregnant.

31:31.490 --> 31:34.126
Joyce, honey, come on,
that's not talk for company.

31:34.160 --> 31:37.729
Bo would have made
such a great father.

31:37.763 --> 31:39.531
I could tell by, you know,

31:39.565 --> 31:41.533
how much of a difference
he made to all of you.

31:41.567 --> 31:45.037
Yeah. Yeah, he really
changed our lives.

31:45.071 --> 31:46.472
(Joyce laughs)

31:46.505 --> 31:48.975
I always loved hearing
all about his "girls"

31:49.008 --> 31:50.376
looking up to him for guidance.

31:50.409 --> 31:51.743
I mean, look at you now.

31:51.777 --> 31:53.946
Joyce, I hate to say it,

31:53.980 --> 31:56.915
but I wasn't Bo's favorite.

31:56.949 --> 31:58.750
-No?
-No.

31:58.784 --> 32:02.088
-Poundcake was.
-JOYCE: Poundcake?

32:02.121 --> 32:03.622
You didn't tell her
about Poundcake?

32:03.655 --> 32:06.158
(scoffs) She doesn't want to
hear about those old stories.

32:06.192 --> 32:07.893
Oh, I do want to hear
the stories.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.795
Which one's Poundcake, Bo?

32:09.828 --> 32:11.830
Joyce, honey.

32:11.863 --> 32:14.066
Cookie and I got to talk about
that book she's gonna write.

32:14.100 --> 32:16.335
Oh, where are my manners?

32:16.368 --> 32:17.936
Let me go get you two
some snacks.

32:21.707 --> 32:24.010
Get your hands off me.

32:24.043 --> 32:26.745
What the hell you think you're
trying to pull, Holloway?

32:26.778 --> 32:28.680
Must've seemed like
a real smart idea

32:28.714 --> 32:30.616
up there in that cute little
head of yours, huh?

32:30.649 --> 32:32.851
-You know, it's against the law.
-What?

32:32.884 --> 32:34.420
Ex-convict coming
to C.O.'s house.

32:34.453 --> 32:35.988
Now, you get the hell
out of here.

32:36.022 --> 32:38.324
The next time you step your foot
on my property, I'll shoot you.

32:38.357 --> 32:40.126
You know what?
The days of you scaring me

32:40.159 --> 32:41.927
are long gone, Bo.

32:41.960 --> 32:44.830
I got enough dirt
to put your wrinkly ass away

32:44.863 --> 32:46.598
for the rest of your
miserable life.

32:46.632 --> 32:49.868
Hell, I've had the governor
in my house for dinner.

32:49.901 --> 32:51.637
You want to try me?

32:51.670 --> 32:54.806
You want to see how fast
I could drop a dime on your ass?

32:54.840 --> 32:56.642
What do you want, Holloway?

32:56.675 --> 32:59.311
I want to know what you did
with Poundcake's baby.

32:59.345 --> 33:00.779
And if you don't tell me,

33:00.812 --> 33:03.349
I'll just tell your wife
how that baby came to be.

33:03.382 --> 33:05.184
What the hell
do you think happened?

33:05.217 --> 33:07.053
Prison babies go in the system.

33:07.086 --> 33:08.454
You're lying.

33:08.487 --> 33:10.456
That baby never made it
into the system.

33:10.489 --> 33:12.358
So what did you do, Bo?

33:12.391 --> 33:15.494
Hmm? Did you kill that baby?

33:15.527 --> 33:16.895
I didn't kill no baby.

33:16.928 --> 33:19.065
(whispering): Shh. I wouldn't
do that. (clicks tongue)

33:19.098 --> 33:21.667
What kind of monster
you think I am?

33:24.370 --> 33:26.205
Okay, look...

33:26.238 --> 33:28.407
that baby was half-white,
you know.

33:28.440 --> 33:30.209
-Really?
-The dark kids

33:30.242 --> 33:33.412
go in the system.
The lighter kids got adopted.

33:33.445 --> 33:35.481
They took the white kids
and the lighter-skinned kids,

33:35.514 --> 33:38.016
and they put them into
a special adoption agency.

33:38.050 --> 33:40.986
-Hope House, it's called.
-Hope House?

33:41.019 --> 33:42.821
Yeah, you better hope
you're not lying.

33:42.854 --> 33:47.559
Because if you are,
I will blow your life up.

33:47.593 --> 33:50.096
I got lemonade
and fresh cinnamon pound cake.

33:50.129 --> 33:52.931
Oh, that's so sweet of you,
Joyce, but I can't stay.

33:52.964 --> 33:56.902
You know it's good to know that
Bo still like eating pound cake.

33:56.935 --> 34:00.406
-Have a good one.
-What...?

34:04.243 --> 34:06.212
Okay, Cookie,
can we please go?

34:06.245 --> 34:10.082
So Hope House is legit,
huh, Thirsty?

34:10.116 --> 34:12.518
All right, well, then I need you
to find out what you can

34:12.551 --> 34:15.221
about a mixed-race baby
born on the dates I gave you.

34:15.254 --> 34:17.123
Okay.

34:17.156 --> 34:20.392
Finally, can we go now?

34:20.426 --> 34:21.927
-No.
-No...

34:21.960 --> 34:25.264
I'm not done.
Leave the engine running.

34:28.300 --> 34:29.935
Oh. Uh, let me get Bo.

34:29.968 --> 34:31.403
No, no, no, no.

34:31.437 --> 34:33.705
-Joyce, it's you I want
to talk to. -Oh, I don't know.

34:33.739 --> 34:36.708
I, uh... I don't want to get
in the middle of anything here.

34:36.742 --> 34:39.645
Your husband is a rapist.

34:39.678 --> 34:41.313
He beat us. He tortured us.

34:41.347 --> 34:43.081
He raped lots of girls
in prison.

34:43.115 --> 34:47.052
He raped this one girl,
Poundcake. They had a baby.

34:47.085 --> 34:48.487
He took it from her

34:48.520 --> 34:51.089
and sold it to some
baby brokers.

34:51.123 --> 34:54.326
-No.
-You should get out of this.

34:54.360 --> 34:56.228
You need to leave him.
Your husband...

34:56.262 --> 34:57.863
What the hell are you doing?

35:00.699 --> 35:02.768
Believe me.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.910
LUCIOUS:
This is crazy.

35:11.943 --> 35:14.913
I mean, Eddie had ten
shell companies set up.

35:14.946 --> 35:16.515
I mean, he had some plan

35:16.548 --> 35:19.117
in which he was gonna
put himself way back on top.

35:19.151 --> 35:21.953
Yeah, a plan that exposed Empire
to an insider trading scandal,

35:21.987 --> 35:23.822
could've gotten us all
thrown in prison.

35:23.855 --> 35:26.658
You need to give Eddie
his walking papers, Pop.

35:30.962 --> 35:34.300
Hey, Dre, you remember
when you were, like, um...

35:34.333 --> 35:35.934
nine or ten

35:35.967 --> 35:38.604
and the police raided our house
and you hid my gun

35:38.637 --> 35:41.139
inside of your box of Legos?

35:41.173 --> 35:44.276
Yeah, I remember.

35:44.310 --> 35:47.379
It seemed like you always
had my back back then.

35:47.413 --> 35:50.316
What happened to that boy?

35:50.349 --> 35:52.684
What happened to my son?

35:55.921 --> 35:58.190
(sighs)

35:58.224 --> 36:01.493
March 22, 2005,

36:01.527 --> 36:03.262
11:37 a.m.

36:04.763 --> 36:07.899
That's the moment I was
diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

36:07.933 --> 36:11.870
From that day on,
that's all you saw

36:11.903 --> 36:14.706
when you looked at me.

36:14.740 --> 36:16.742
Damaged son.

36:16.775 --> 36:19.511
But you are damaged.

36:19.545 --> 36:21.580
And what about you?

36:21.613 --> 36:25.150
Your sickness is so deep.

36:25.183 --> 36:27.419
You're a sociopath.

36:27.453 --> 36:30.656
You have no remorse
for anything you do,

36:30.689 --> 36:32.524
ever.

36:39.064 --> 36:41.767
You sound pretty damaged
to me, too, Pop.

36:48.274 --> 36:49.841
* Okay, I'm going to the top *

36:49.875 --> 36:51.176
* I'm-a never stop *

36:51.209 --> 36:53.445
* Plus you got the swag
of an undercover cop *

36:53.479 --> 36:55.113
* Or a plumber or an opp *

36:55.146 --> 36:57.182
* The dude from
Dumb and Dumber-- hold up *

36:57.215 --> 36:59.685
* No wonder you got
the floor covered, you a mop. *

36:59.718 --> 37:00.786
We got it.

37:00.819 --> 37:02.721
-(applause)
-Bring it in.

37:02.754 --> 37:04.222
Yup.

37:04.256 --> 37:07.759
Hey, I told you,
hard work pays off, gentlemen.

37:07.793 --> 37:10.762
-Good stuff, boy.
-Yeah. So...

37:10.796 --> 37:12.631
being that this is the end
of a hard day's work,

37:12.664 --> 37:16.234
off to the strip club we go!
(laughs)

37:16.268 --> 37:17.869
Unless you still
locked down, right?

37:17.903 --> 37:19.705
-Stop that, bruh.
-(laughs)

37:19.738 --> 37:21.139
Come on, let's move.

37:23.475 --> 37:24.943
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

37:24.976 --> 37:26.945
Where you think you going,
grasshopper?

37:26.978 --> 37:28.747
You got dues to pay.
Look around.

37:30.349 --> 37:32.050
I got to clean this up?

37:32.083 --> 37:34.320
Hey, don't ask me.
That's your sensei now.

37:34.353 --> 37:36.322
Nah. Start with the ashes
in the carpet.

37:36.355 --> 37:37.989
-(sighs)
-My dad hates that.

37:38.023 --> 37:39.825
Enjoy.

37:39.858 --> 37:41.660
So I'm not going
to the strip club?

37:42.994 --> 37:44.129
(sighs)

37:46.465 --> 37:48.634
SHINE: Hey, man, you gonna love
this club, just opened up.

37:48.667 --> 37:50.936
The girls is out of control.
Wait till you see Cinnamon.

37:50.969 --> 37:53.472
(indistinct chatter)

37:53.505 --> 37:56.174
-I'm gonna catch up with you.
-Yo, where you going?

37:56.207 --> 37:59.244
Hey, hold up. Wait...

37:59.277 --> 38:01.279
Whipped.

38:01.313 --> 38:02.948
MAN:
For real, man.

38:07.319 --> 38:09.321
(Tiana gasps)

38:09.355 --> 38:11.022
You okay?

38:13.124 --> 38:14.760
Yeah, I'm fine.

38:14.793 --> 38:18.296
What, are you back
to take back what you own?

38:18.330 --> 38:19.931
You should probably
get some rest.

38:19.965 --> 38:21.367
No, I shouldn't.

38:21.400 --> 38:22.801
Everything has to be right.

38:22.834 --> 38:25.471
The-the costumes,
the lighting, the moves.

38:25.504 --> 38:27.439
And right now, it's all wrong.

38:27.473 --> 38:29.608
People out here doing
the best they can for you.

38:29.641 --> 38:33.178
You cursing folks out.

38:33.211 --> 38:35.881
Firing folks on the spot.

38:35.914 --> 38:37.449
That's not the girl I know.

38:37.483 --> 38:39.885
I'm not that girl
anymore, Hakeem.

38:39.918 --> 38:42.287
Eddie saw something in me,

38:42.320 --> 38:44.690
and he promised that
if I just stay focused,

38:44.723 --> 38:46.157
that he'd get me here.

38:46.191 --> 38:49.995
Okay, no distractions.

38:50.028 --> 38:52.498
That's why you turned down
my proposal?

38:52.531 --> 38:55.567
Everything is not about you.

38:55.601 --> 38:59.004
Eddie knows what I have to do
to get what I want.

38:59.037 --> 39:02.040
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm
gonna get back to my rehearsal.

39:04.209 --> 39:05.777
Okay.

39:22.928 --> 39:25.831
* This is how it feel to have
a winning streak, baby *

39:25.864 --> 39:27.899
* Rockin' ...
you can't pull off... *

39:27.933 --> 39:29.568
Hey, how you doing?

39:29.601 --> 39:31.770
-It's good to see you.
-Jamal Lyon, DJ Selection.

39:31.803 --> 39:33.338
What's up, man.
Thank you for having us.

39:33.371 --> 39:36.708
-Welcome to my den of misfits.
-Can you play this track, love?

39:36.742 --> 39:38.544
-Who's the artist?
-It's a new artist.

39:38.577 --> 39:40.879
Who'd like to remain anonymous
for the time being.

39:40.912 --> 39:43.415
* Rings, got a few on *

39:43.449 --> 39:45.717
* Got gold like a leprechaun,
my girl got a leopard on... *

39:45.751 --> 39:47.252
All right, y'all.

39:47.285 --> 39:50.355
We got an exclusive
here tonight.

39:50.388 --> 39:51.957
No introductions needed.

39:51.990 --> 39:54.159
You already know what to do.
So let's go.

39:56.261 --> 39:58.964
* They could see us
falling out *

39:58.997 --> 40:01.066
* But I can see us
fall tonight *

40:01.099 --> 40:04.636
* They could see us
coming down *

40:04.670 --> 40:07.038
* But I could see us
going higher *

40:07.072 --> 40:09.708
* Selfish teardrops *

40:09.741 --> 40:12.478
* Fall from memories *

40:12.511 --> 40:14.980
* I broke your heart *

40:15.013 --> 40:17.115
* But no more crying now *

40:17.148 --> 40:18.484
(crowd cheers)

40:18.517 --> 40:21.286
* They think our picture
is broken *

40:21.319 --> 40:23.288
* But maybe it was
out of focus *

40:23.321 --> 40:25.390
* They don't know we're gold *

40:25.423 --> 40:26.892
* They don't know
we're gold... *

40:26.925 --> 40:27.893
* Yeah *

40:27.926 --> 40:29.127
You think Empire's
ready for this?

40:29.160 --> 40:31.963
It don't really matter,
'cause I am.

40:31.997 --> 40:34.466
What'd y'all think?
How'd y'all like it?

40:34.500 --> 40:36.468
* They don't know we're gold,
they don't know we're gold *

40:36.502 --> 40:39.137
* They don't know we're gold. *

40:39.170 --> 40:40.939
(door closes)

40:44.843 --> 40:47.646
-Baby?
-Yeah?

40:47.679 --> 40:48.847
What, you over here working?

40:48.880 --> 40:50.281
You sure your cardiologist
would approve?

40:50.315 --> 40:51.617
No, I'm just putting some money

40:51.650 --> 40:52.918
on the books for some girls

40:52.951 --> 40:54.185
still behind the wall,
that's all.

40:54.219 --> 40:55.954
Somebody shaking you down?

40:55.987 --> 40:57.956
(laughs):
No. Not at all.

40:57.989 --> 40:59.925
So, um...

40:59.958 --> 41:03.194
How did today go?

41:03.228 --> 41:06.464
It was good. It was good.

41:06.498 --> 41:08.500
Okay.

41:13.238 --> 41:15.440
You gonna let me just
walk away with that?

41:15.473 --> 41:18.343
Are you okay, baby?

41:18.376 --> 41:22.347
I saw two women today.

41:22.380 --> 41:24.349
One was dying,

41:24.382 --> 41:26.184
and one was just living a lie.

41:26.217 --> 41:29.955
And after all of this stuff
that happened with my heart

41:29.988 --> 41:33.859
and seeing those women,
I just...

41:33.892 --> 41:36.494
I don't want to take my life
for granted anymore.

41:36.528 --> 41:37.729
And Lucious,
I hear you saying

41:37.763 --> 41:39.497
you want me back
and you want things

41:39.531 --> 41:42.834
back the way they were, but I'm
not interested in going back.

41:42.868 --> 41:44.402
I-I want to move forward.

41:44.435 --> 41:46.071
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What are you saying?

41:46.104 --> 41:49.340
-I mean, are you...
-What?

41:49.374 --> 41:50.909
You're saying you don't want
to be with me anymore?

41:50.942 --> 41:52.010
Is that what...

41:52.043 --> 41:53.545
That's not what I said, Lucious.

41:53.579 --> 41:55.246
For a minute, I thought you were

41:55.280 --> 41:57.215
winding up to sing me
some swan song.

41:57.248 --> 41:58.216
I'm... Look.

41:58.249 --> 42:01.987
I'm being serious. Okay?

42:02.020 --> 42:03.722
I love you.

42:03.755 --> 42:05.557
I do, but I don't

42:05.591 --> 42:07.726
want things to go back
to the way they were

42:07.759 --> 42:10.862
because I can't deal with
the lies and the cheating and...

42:10.896 --> 42:12.931
and the competition.

42:12.964 --> 42:15.867
I just...
(sighs)

42:15.901 --> 42:18.503
I just need things to be better.

42:18.536 --> 42:20.405
You are my better.

42:20.438 --> 42:23.208
I don't want half
of what's yours.

42:23.241 --> 42:26.678
I need to share what's ours.

42:26.712 --> 42:29.681
I want to be your partner
in business

42:29.715 --> 42:31.482
and in life.

42:32.884 --> 42:36.254
I need your respect, Lucious.

42:38.757 --> 42:42.160
(sighs)
Cookie.

42:44.462 --> 42:47.633
I respect you

42:47.666 --> 42:51.569
and appreciate you
more than anything in life.

42:51.603 --> 42:53.905
Okay?

43:12.290 --> 43:14.292
*

44:01.406 --> 44:02.640
Yeah.
