UH, WELL, YEAH, MAYBE,

09:31.750 --> 09:34.041
YOU KNOW, IF, UM,
IF SOMEONE DROPS OUT.

09:34.083 --> 09:36.875
YOU CAN'T GET MORE PRIMAL
AND LIFE GIVING THAN D.N.A.

09:36.917 --> 09:39.041
DELL?

09:39.083 --> 09:42.667
EXCUSE ME. UH, DO YOU STILL
HAVE TIME FOR THAT CONSULT?

09:42.709 --> 09:44.041
THE LITTLE GIRL?

09:44.083 --> 09:46.333
YEAH. UM, PLEASE TELL ME
I'M READING THAT WRONG.

09:46.375 --> 09:48.458
OH.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.667
COOPER ASKED
FOR A SECOND OPINION,

09:50.709 --> 09:53.834
BUT THE GENETIC TESTS WE RAN
CONFIRM THAT

09:53.875 --> 09:56.041
EMILY HAS A SERIOUS PRESENTATION
OF SOMETHING CALLED

09:56.083 --> 09:58.417
PELIZAEUS-MERZBACHER DISEASE.

09:58.458 --> 10:00.125
HOW DO WE CURE IT?

10:00.166 --> 10:02.917
WELL, THERE'S MEDICATION
TO TREAT THE SYMPTOMS,

10:02.959 --> 10:05.208
BUT THERE IS NO CURE.

10:05.250 --> 10:07.291
SO SHE'S...

10:07.333 --> 10:11.041
NOT GOING TO GET BETTER?

10:11.083 --> 10:14.667
EVER?
THE DRUGS CAN GIVE HER
FIVE YEARS, MAYBE MORE.

10:14.709 --> 10:16.417
WHAT?
FIVE YEAR--FIVE?

10:16.458 --> 10:19.750
I'M SORRY. I KNOW THIS IS
DIFFICULT TO HEAR.

10:19.792 --> 10:21.500
AND WE WILL DO EVERYTHING
THAT WE CAN.

10:21.542 --> 10:23.125
WAIT, YOU SAID THAT THIS
WAS GENETIC.

10:23.166 --> 10:26.041
SO ONE OF US MADE HER SICK?
NO, YOU CAN'T THINK OF IT
LIKE THAT.

10:26.083 --> 10:28.917
BECAUSE MY SISTER,
SHE'S TRYING TO GET PREGNANT.

10:28.959 --> 10:30.917
I MEAN,
COULD SHE HAVE THIS, TOO?
WE'LL HAVE TO RUN
SOME BLOOD TESTS.

10:30.959 --> 10:33.667
WE'LL SEE WHICH MUTATION
YOU'RE CARRYING.

10:33.709 --> 10:35.375
IT'S IMPORTANT NOT ONLY
FOR YOUR SISTER,

10:35.417 --> 10:38.166
BUT ALSO FOR YOU,
IFAND WHEN YOU SHOULD DECIDE

10:38.208 --> 10:40.166
YOU WANT OTHER CHILDREN.

10:40.208 --> 10:43.583
NO. EMILY--
EMILY IS ALL WE NEED.

10:49.291 --> 10:51.291
EXCUSE ME. I'M LOOKING FOR
A DAVE WALKER.

10:51.333 --> 10:55.041
HE CAME IN WITH VOMITING
AND SEVERE DEHYDRATION.

10:55.083 --> 10:57.542
HE WAS RELEASED
15 MINUTES AGO.

10:57.583 --> 11:00.375
ON WHOSE ORDERS?

11:00.417 --> 11:02.291
YOU DON'T RELEASE MY PATIENT
WITHOUT CALLING ME.

11:02.333 --> 11:04.291
DON'T LECTURE ME
ON MEDICAL ETIQUETTE.

11:04.333 --> 11:06.291
THE VITALS WERE NORMAL,
WE NEEDED THE BAYS,

11:06.333 --> 11:08.041
AND HE WANTED TO LEAVE.

11:08.083 --> 11:09.291
PROBABLY JUST HAD
SOME 24-HOUR BUG.

11:09.333 --> 11:11.000
WELL, IT DIDN'T
LOOK LIKE A BUG.

11:11.041 --> 11:13.000
HE WAS UNCONSCIOUS
WHEN I FOUND HIM.

11:13.041 --> 11:15.000
HE SAID IT WAS SOMETHING
HE ATE,

11:15.041 --> 11:18.000
BUT HE TESTED NEGATIVE
FOR E. COLI, SALMONELLA--

11:18.041 --> 11:20.291
THAT STILL LEAVES ABOUT
A HUNDRED OTHER POSSIBILITIES,

11:20.333 --> 11:22.291
NONE OF WHICH REQUIRE
HOSPITAL STAYS.

11:22.333 --> 11:24.875
HE WAS FINE, SAM.

11:24.917 --> 11:26.959
BESIDES, GRANDMA SAID
SHE COULD HANDLE IT.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.959
THE SAME GRANDMA WHO COULDN'T
CALL 9-1-1?

11:29.041 --> 11:32.000
THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T RELEASE
MY PATIENTS WITHOUT CALLING ME.

11:35.083 --> 11:37.250
ANY WORD BACK
ABOUT THE LITTLE GIRL?

11:37.291 --> 11:40.041
YEAH, BUT THE TEST RESULTS
DON'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

11:40.083 --> 11:43.542
SOMETIMES THEY CAN BE
HARD TO READ. LET ME SEE.

11:43.583 --> 11:46.041
THIS DOES NOT...
NO, NO.

11:46.083 --> 11:49.041
YOU SEE THE...

11:49.083 --> 11:51.041
THIS DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE.

11:51.083 --> 11:53.125
WHICH MUTATION DID THE PARENTS
PASS ON TO EMILY?

11:53.166 --> 11:54.667
NONE.

11:54.709 --> 11:57.667
WELL, HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

11:57.709 --> 11:59.625
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT
HER PARENTS.

12:06.959 --> 12:09.041
EMILY IS OURS. SHE'S MY BABY.

12:09.083 --> 12:12.000
UH, THERE'S THE CHANCE
THAT THIS WAS HUMAN ERROR--

12:12.041 --> 12:15.792
THE HOSPITAL NURSERY WRISTBANDS
FELL OFF, GOT MIXED UP.

12:15.834 --> 12:18.166
THERE IS ALSO THE POSSIBILITY
THAT SOMEONE

12:18.208 --> 12:21.041
MAY HAVE DONE THIS ON PURPOSE.

12:21.083 --> 12:22.917
ARE--
ARE YOU ACCUSING US?

12:22.959 --> 12:25.041
I MEAN, YOU THINK THAT
WE WANTED THIS?
RIGHT NOW,

12:25.083 --> 12:27.500
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS TAKE CARE OF EMILY,

12:27.542 --> 12:30.834
AND WE'LL FIND OUT
WHAT HAPPENED.

12:30.875 --> 12:34.041
I'M TELLING YOU, THERE IS
SOMETHING WRONG WITH THIS GUY.

12:34.083 --> 12:36.041
WE TELL HIM HIS DAUGHTER'S
DYING, HE'S COLD AS ICE.

12:36.083 --> 12:37.750
WE TELL HIM HE'S NOT
THE FATHER,

12:37.792 --> 12:40.208
HE GETS DEFENSIVE
RIGHT OFF THE BAT.

12:40.250 --> 12:43.041
PEOPLE REACT TO TERRIBLE NEWS
IN DIFFERENT WAYS.

12:43.083 --> 12:46.041
IT'S HIS CHILD.
SHOW SOME EMOTION.
WHERE DID BETH GIVE BIRTH?

12:46.083 --> 12:48.041
ST. AMBROSE.
OH, PERFECT.

12:48.083 --> 12:50.041
CHARLOTTE KING'S HOSPITAL.
I'M GOING OVER THERE.

12:50.083 --> 12:53.041
NO, YOU--YOU NEED TO STAY HERE
AND JUST CALM DOWN. WE'LL GO.

12:53.083 --> 12:54.333
FINE.

12:54.375 --> 12:56.125
(intercom beeps)

12:56.166 --> 12:58.709
WHERE ARE
THOSE NURSERY RECORDS?

12:58.750 --> 13:00.792
THERE WAS
NO STOLEN BABY REPORTED--

13:00.834 --> 13:02.667
NOT IN THIS HOSPITAL,

13:02.709 --> 13:04.166
NOT WHILE I WAS CHIEF.

13:04.208 --> 13:08.041
WELL, THEN TWO SETS OF PARENTS
WENT HOME WITH THE WRONG BABIES.

13:08.083 --> 13:10.041
(scoffs) I SWEAR,
DO YOU ALL TAKE

13:10.083 --> 13:13.000
SOME KIND OF PERVERSE PLEASURE
IN RUINING MY LIFE?

13:13.041 --> 13:16.041
YEAH, THERE ARE SWITCHED BABIES
OUT THERE, BUT THIS IS ABOUT US.

13:16.083 --> 13:19.041
THIS HOSPITAL HAS THE BEST
NURSES IN THE CITY.

13:19.083 --> 13:21.041
NEONATE SPENT A FORTUNE
ON SECURITY.

13:21.083 --> 13:22.583
(intercom beeps)

13:22.625 --> 13:24.583
DID ST. AMBROSE
INSTITUTE NAP TIME,

13:24.625 --> 13:26.750
OR DO I STILL HAVE A STAFF?
THEN WHY DON'T YOU SHOW US

13:26.792 --> 13:29.375
THE RECORDS FOR THE OTHER BABIES
THAT WERE IN THE NURSERY

13:29.417 --> 13:32.000
THE TIME THAT EMILY WAS THERE?

13:35.083 --> 13:37.041
WILL SOMEONE JUST BR--

13:37.083 --> 13:38.625
THANK YOU.

13:41.458 --> 13:43.542
THERE WAS ONLY ONE OTHER

13:43.583 --> 13:46.041
AFRICAN-AMERICAN GIRL
IN THE NURSERY AT THAT TIME.

13:46.083 --> 13:48.041
WHO IS IT?

13:51.417 --> 13:55.375
THIS HOSPITAL SPENT 124 YEARS
BUILDING ITS REPUTATION.

13:55.417 --> 13:58.041
I AM NOT GONNA RUIN THAT
BY CHATTING WITH YOU.

13:58.083 --> 14:00.375
CAN YOU JUST
GIVE US THE NAME?

14:00.417 --> 14:03.291
NOT UNTIL I TALK
TO OUR ATTORNEYS.

14:03.333 --> 14:06.208
BLOOD PRESSURE
125 OVER 84.

14:06.250 --> 14:08.041
THAT'S NORMAL.

14:08.083 --> 14:10.041
YEAH.
I FEEL A LOT BETTER.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.041
OKAY.

14:11.083 --> 14:12.333
MAYBE A LITTLE SHAKY.

14:12.375 --> 14:14.333
WHAT--WHAT DO YOU THINK
IT WAS?

14:14.375 --> 14:16.083
STILL NOT SURE.

14:16.125 --> 14:17.333
JUST TO BE SAFE,

14:17.375 --> 14:19.625
WHY DON'T YOU CLEAN
THE KITCHEN TOP TO BOTTOM?

14:19.667 --> 14:23.041
IT'S NOT THE FOOD
THAT GOT HIM SICK.
MA, PLEASE.

14:23.083 --> 14:25.041
OH, STEVIE.

14:25.083 --> 14:28.041
CLOSE THE DOOR, HONEY.
I'LL LEAVE IT OPEN.

14:28.083 --> 14:29.875
THEN THE NEXT TIME DAD
PASSES OUT,

14:29.917 --> 14:33.125
NO ONE'S GOT TO BREAK
A WINDOW TO GET IN.
HEY, STEVIE.
IS HE OKAY?

14:33.166 --> 14:35.125
OH, HE'S JUST BULLHEADED,
LIKE HIS DAD.

14:35.166 --> 14:38.041
(chuckles)
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
AND YOUR MOM?

14:38.083 --> 14:39.667
WE'RE DOING REAL GOOD, DOC.

14:39.709 --> 14:42.000
THINGS ARE GOOD.

14:47.083 --> 14:49.041
(Sam)
SO WHAT AM I MISSING?

14:49.083 --> 14:51.041
WELL,
IN 90% OF THESE CASES,

14:51.083 --> 14:53.041
IT COMES DOWN TO HISTORY
AND ENVIRONMENT.

14:53.083 --> 14:55.041
OH, WELL, THE ENVIRONMENT'S
ALL MESSED UP.

14:55.083 --> 14:56.417
THE DAD'S DRINKING,

14:56.458 --> 14:58.417
GRANDMA'S GOT WAY MORE
THAN SHE CAN HANDLE,

14:58.458 --> 15:01.417
THE KID'S ACTING OUT.
THAT SOUNDS A LOT MORE SERIOUS
THAN A 24-HOUR FLU.

15:01.458 --> 15:03.417
(elevator bell dings)
SEE, THAT'S WHY I'M WORRIED.

15:03.458 --> 15:05.417
THEY'VE GOT ENOUGH
TO DEAL WITH AS IS.

15:05.458 --> 15:07.417
AND IF DAVID'S GOT SOMETHING
REALLY SERIOUS,

15:07.458 --> 15:10.041
I'M NOT SURE
HOW THEY HOLD IT TOGETHER.
HEY, COOP.

15:10.083 --> 15:11.625
HEY... GINGER.
(laughs)

15:11.667 --> 15:14.166
I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU IN...

15:14.208 --> 15:17.333
I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU. HEY.
HEY.

15:17.375 --> 15:20.333
TELL ME THAT IS NOT THE GIRL
FROM LAST NIGHT.

15:20.375 --> 15:22.333
COOPER'S BRINGING 'EM
TO WORK NOW?

15:22.375 --> 15:27.250
OH, MY GOD. THAT'S IT.
HE HAS JUST CROSSED THE LINE.

15:27.291 --> 15:29.041
SAM JUST HUGGED
A STRIPPER.

15:29.083 --> 15:31.041
GOD, AT LEAST WITH COOPER,
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE.

15:31.083 --> 15:33.041
OKAY, NOW LET'S ALL
CALM DOWN.

15:33.083 --> 15:35.041
SAM IS NOT A DOG.
HE NEVER WAS.

15:35.083 --> 15:36.250
NOW THERE COULD BE

15:36.291 --> 15:38.250
A TOTALLY INNOCENT
EXPLANATION FOR THIS.

15:38.291 --> 15:40.875
WHAT--WHAT--WHAT,
FOR STRIPPER HUGGING?

15:40.917 --> 15:42.875
GIVE ME ONE. GIVE ME ONE.

15:42.917 --> 15:45.041
WELL...

15:45.083 --> 15:48.000
LIKE SHE'S HERE TO SEE
THE REAL DOG.

15:49.792 --> 15:52.250
OH, WOULD--WOULD YOU
LOOK AT HIM?

15:52.291 --> 15:55.166
HE'S ALL...

15:55.208 --> 15:57.750
"I'M A DOCTOR.
MY TOUCH HEALS."

15:57.792 --> 15:59.041
(footsteps approach)

15:59.083 --> 16:01.041
(Charlotte clears throat)

16:01.083 --> 16:04.166
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

16:04.208 --> 16:05.709
I SPOKE TO OUR ATTORNEYS.

16:05.750 --> 16:07.041
AND?

16:07.083 --> 16:09.125
SOME DAYS I REALLY HATE
THE HIPPOCRATIC OATH.

16:09.166 --> 16:10.667
HERE.

16:10.709 --> 16:13.458
HERE'S THE FILE ON THE SECOND
AFRICAN-AMERICAN BABY

16:13.500 --> 16:15.041
IN THE HOSPITAL NURSERY.

16:15.083 --> 16:17.375
YOU'RE JUST GIVING IT TO US,
JUST LIKE THAT?

16:17.417 --> 16:21.667
IF YOU THINK I'M BEING NICE,
READ THE NAME.

16:21.709 --> 16:24.709
OH, GOD.
WHAT?

16:24.750 --> 16:26.166
AND MY PROBLEM
BECOMES YOUR PROBLEM.

16:26.208 --> 16:28.041
MELINDA
AND DUNCAN STINSON.

16:28.083 --> 16:30.041
YOU KNOW THEM?

16:30.083 --> 16:32.291
I GOT THEM PREGNANT.

16:37.875 --> 16:39.709
(man) WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF YOUR HANDIWORK, NAOMI?

16:39.750 --> 16:41.709
(Naomi)
OH, SHE IS SO CUTE.
AND IF YOU TELL ME

16:41.750 --> 16:43.375
I'VE GOT MORE HORMONE'S
TO TAKE,

16:43.417 --> 16:45.041
I'M GONNA SCREAM.
OH, NO. NO, NO, NO.

16:45.083 --> 16:48.000
IT'S JUST, UH, WE NEED
TO RUN SOME BLOOD TESTS

16:48.041 --> 16:49.500
ON ALL OF YOU.

16:49.542 --> 16:52.166
WHAT'S GOING ON?

16:52.208 --> 16:54.333
(Addison) SO HOW ARE YOU
HOLDING UP?

16:54.375 --> 16:58.041
I'LL BE BETTER WHEN WE
FIND OUT WHO DID THIS?

16:58.083 --> 17:00.208
ALL YOUR NURSES CHECK OUT?

17:00.250 --> 17:03.041
ONE MOVED A FEW DAYS LATER,

17:03.083 --> 17:05.041
BUT HER RECORD
WAS IMPECCABLE.

17:05.083 --> 17:08.166
WELL, SOMETHING HAPPENED
IN THAT NURSERY.
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

17:08.208 --> 17:11.041
THAT DOESN'T STOP YOU FROM
TOSSING THE BLAME MY WAY.

17:11.083 --> 17:13.041
I KNOW THAT IF
ONE OF MY PATIENTS

17:13.083 --> 17:14.750
WAS IN THIS MUCH PAIN,

17:14.792 --> 17:17.583
I WOULD BE BUSTING MY ASS
LOOKING FOR ANSWERS.
THANK YOU.

17:17.625 --> 17:21.000
I HADN'T GOTTEN MY EARFUL
OF OCEANSIDE ARROGANCE TODAY.

17:24.667 --> 17:27.792
(Sam) LOOK AT HIM.

17:27.834 --> 17:29.834
HOW IS THAT GUY

17:29.875 --> 17:32.041
AND THE GUY WHO HIRED ME
A STRIPPER

17:32.083 --> 17:34.041
THE SAME PERSON?

17:34.083 --> 17:37.917
(chuckles) HE'S COOPER.

17:37.959 --> 17:39.917
SO THIS OTHER COUPLE...

17:39.959 --> 17:41.917
THEIR BABY WAS BORN
THE SAME NIGHT?

17:41.959 --> 17:43.166
THAT'S RIGHT.

17:43.208 --> 17:45.917
WE'RE--WE'RE RUNNING
BLOOD TESTS ON THEM NOW.

17:45.959 --> 17:48.041
WHAT IF
THE OTHER BLOOD TESTS

17:48.083 --> 17:50.041
COME BACK POSITIVE?

17:50.083 --> 17:51.917
THIS IS THE HARD PART.

17:51.959 --> 17:53.917
UM...

17:53.959 --> 17:57.291
ACCORDING TO CALIFORNIA LAW...

17:57.333 --> 17:59.875
YOU WOULD...

17:59.917 --> 18:02.750
SAY GOOD-BYE TO EMILY...

18:02.792 --> 18:05.750
AND YOU WOULD WELCOME
A NEW CHILD INTO YOUR LIVES.

18:05.792 --> 18:07.750
THAT'S--THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
OKAY?

18:07.792 --> 18:10.291
THE BLOOD TESTS ARE NOT
GONNA COME BACK POSITIVE

18:10.333 --> 18:12.208
AND I DON'T CARE
WHAT OUR BLOOD TESTS SAID--

18:12.250 --> 18:13.750
HONEY, HONEY--

18:13.792 --> 18:16.333
NO. NO. I KNOW EMILY
IS MY DAUGHTER, OKAY?

18:16.375 --> 18:19.500
A MOTHER
CAN FEEL THESE THINGS.

18:19.542 --> 18:21.834
I DON'T LOVE
THAT OTHER CHILD.

18:21.875 --> 18:23.959
I COULDN'T LOVE ANOTHER BABY.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.166
I LOVE EMILY.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.959
WELL, WHY DON'T WE JUST WAIT

18:30.000 --> 18:31.959
FOR THE RESULTS
OF THE BLOOD TEST

18:32.000 --> 18:33.959
AND GO FROM THERE?

18:34.000 --> 18:35.917
(Cooper)
EMILY'S HAD A HARD TIME,

18:35.959 --> 18:38.125
NOW SHE HAS TO ADJUST
TO A WHOLE NEW FAMILY?

18:38.166 --> 18:39.917
WELL, THE BABIES ARE YOUNG.

18:39.959 --> 18:42.667
YOU KNOW, ADOPTIONS TAKE PLACE
AT THIS AGE ALL THE TIME.

18:42.709 --> 18:45.667
THE KIDS ARE USUALLY FINE. IT'S
THE PARENTS I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

18:45.709 --> 18:48.041
THEY'RE THE ONES WHO GRIEVE.
GREG O'BRIEN DOESN'T SEEM
TO BE GRIEVING.

18:48.083 --> 18:50.166
WHAT IS UP WITH YOU
AND THIS CASE?

18:50.208 --> 18:52.250
YOUR EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENT
IS HUGE.
YOU'RE ONE TO LECTURE ME

18:52.291 --> 18:54.333
ABOUT UNHEALTHY
EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENTS.

18:54.375 --> 18:56.333
OKAY, THAT WAS
A NICE DEFLECTION.

18:56.375 --> 18:58.333
BUT UNLIKE YOU,
I AM DETACHING.

18:58.375 --> 19:01.000
YOU WANT TO TRY IT?

19:01.041 --> 19:03.250
IT'S YOURS.

19:03.291 --> 19:04.959
LIGHT.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.083
WHY DIDN'T ALLAN
BUY HIS OWN BIKE?

19:08.125 --> 19:09.542
ON OUR THIRD ANNIVERSARY,

19:09.583 --> 19:11.542
YOU KNOW,
WE TOOK THAT TRIP TO ITALY,

19:11.583 --> 19:14.083
AND HE TOOK ME TO THE TOWN
WHERE THEY MADE THOSE

19:14.125 --> 19:17.083
BECAUSE EVEN AS A CHILD
HE HAD--HE'D WANTED ONE.

19:17.125 --> 19:19.083
SO HE SAVED UP HIS MONEY...

19:19.125 --> 19:21.542
BUT THEN HIS DAD SPLIT
ON HIS MOM,

19:21.583 --> 19:23.542
SO HE HAD TO USE HIS SAVINGS

19:23.583 --> 19:27.041
TO PAY RENT
AND TO KEEP HIS MOM AFLOAT.

19:27.083 --> 19:29.834
AND HE NEVER GOT THE BIKE.

19:29.875 --> 19:31.917
WHAT? WHAT?

19:31.959 --> 19:33.917
TAKE THE BIKE.
YOU LOVE IT.

19:33.959 --> 19:35.917
YEAH, I LOVED IT
WHEN I THOUGHT

19:35.959 --> 19:37.917
IT WAS A COOL, SEXY,
"GET ME LAID" BIKE,

19:37.959 --> 19:40.625
NOT SOME SAD, ALLAN-Y
"CAT'S IN THE CRADLE" BIKE.

19:44.625 --> 19:46.667
(Addison) HEY.

19:46.709 --> 19:48.583
IS THAT STRIPPER
STILL IN YOUR OFFICE?

19:48.625 --> 19:51.333
ENTERTAINER
NOT STRIPPER, AND YES.

19:51.375 --> 19:54.333
AND SHE'S BEEN IN THERE
ALL DAY? WHY?

19:54.375 --> 19:56.667
WE'RE TRYING
A FEW DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES.

19:56.709 --> 19:58.667
(chuckles) OH, YEAH,
I'M SURE YOU ARE.

19:58.709 --> 20:00.208
YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:00.250 --> 20:03.583
NAOMI DOES NOT NEED GINGER
THROWN IN HER FACE.

20:03.625 --> 20:05.750
NAOMI IS A BIG GIRL.
SHE CAN HANDLE IT.

20:05.792 --> 20:08.250
SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO.
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

20:08.291 --> 20:10.250
(Ginger) PETE, IS IT
SUPPOSED TO FEEL TINGLY?

20:10.291 --> 20:13.250
(imitates Ginger) "PETE,
IS IT SUPPOSED TO FEEL..."

20:13.291 --> 20:15.291
(normal voice) YOU KNOW WHAT?
GO. GO DO--

20:15.333 --> 20:18.000
TAKE CARE OF YOUR POOR LITTLE
STRIPPER GIRL AND HER "TINGLY."

20:18.041 --> 20:20.166
ENTERTAINER, AND WHY
ARE YOU SO ANGRY AT ME?
YOU--I--

20:20.208 --> 20:23.166
COOPER'S THE ONE THAT
SET THIS--
YOU KNOW, I AM TRYING
TO TAKE CARE OF MY FRIEND.

20:23.208 --> 20:24.625
AND COOPER IS BAD,
BUT YOU'RE WORSE.

20:24.667 --> 20:26.458
AND YOU KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE YOU'RE SLIPPERY. YEAH.

20:26.500 --> 20:28.834
YOU WALK AROUND PRETENDING
TO BE ALL SOULFUL,

20:28.875 --> 20:31.083
BUT YOU DON'T TAKE THE HEAT.

20:31.125 --> 20:34.417
YOU JUST DO WHATEVER YOU WANT
TO DO AND YOU EVADE.

20:34.458 --> 20:36.458
EVADE, EVADE, EVADE.

20:39.041 --> 20:41.500
DO YOU NEED ME
TO KISS YOU AGAIN?

20:41.542 --> 20:43.375
NO!

20:43.417 --> 20:46.000
OKAY.

20:47.500 --> 20:49.458
(sighs)

20:49.500 --> 20:51.333
OH.

20:54.709 --> 20:57.458
YOU'RE BACK.

20:57.500 --> 20:59.333
NURSES' SCHEDULES...

20:59.375 --> 21:01.041
PERINATAL TESTING,

21:01.083 --> 21:02.667
PERSONNEL FILES.

21:02.709 --> 21:04.875
WHAT'D YOU FIND?

21:04.917 --> 21:06.458
NOT A DAMN THING.

21:06.500 --> 21:09.458
I HAVE BEEN THROUGH EVERY ONE
OF THESE BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS.

21:09.500 --> 21:12.458
YOU'RE SO SURE MY HOSPITAL
RUINED THESE PEOPLE'S LIVES,

21:12.500 --> 21:14.250
THEN HELP ME PROVE IT.

21:14.291 --> 21:15.709
(elevator bell dings)

21:15.750 --> 21:17.250
(woman) PLEASE!
SOMEONE HURRY!

21:17.291 --> 21:19.458
HELP ME! PLEASE!

21:19.500 --> 21:21.375
(shouts indistinctly)
SAM! SAM, FRONT.

21:21.417 --> 21:23.750
HEY! HEY! HELP!
PLEASE, HELP ME!

21:23.792 --> 21:26.375
YEAH, MA'AM, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
PLEASE. OH, HURRY.
GET HIM. HERE.

21:26.417 --> 21:29.041
(speaks indistinctly)
SAM!

21:29.083 --> 21:31.041
STEVIE, WHAT'S GOING ON?
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

21:31.083 --> 21:33.333
WHATEVER MY DAD HAD...
(coughs)
WHOA.

21:33.375 --> 21:35.458
(moans) I GOT IT WORSE.

21:35.500 --> 21:37.041
(groans)

21:42.166 --> 21:43.917
I GOT HOME.

21:43.959 --> 21:45.917
GRANDMA MADE DAD AND ME
SOME SANDWICHES,

21:45.959 --> 21:50.041
THEN... PUKEVILLE.
MRS. WALKER, WHAT DID I
TELL YOU ABOUT THAT KITCHEN?

21:50.083 --> 21:51.750
WELL, IT WAS JUST
A SANDWICH.

21:51.792 --> 21:54.083
THAT COULD'VE KILLED HIM.

21:54.125 --> 21:56.041
(sighs)

21:56.083 --> 21:57.583
WHERE IS YOUR FATHER?

21:57.625 --> 22:01.000
AT--AT WORK.
I DIDN'T WANT
TO BOTHER HIM WITH THIS.

22:01.041 --> 22:03.583
MRS. WALKER, I UNDERSTAND
YOU MEAN WELL FOR YOUR FAMILY,

22:03.625 --> 22:06.375
BUT SOMETHING YOU ARE DOING
IS MAKING THEM SICK.

22:06.417 --> 22:08.375
THIS IS A FAMILY MATTER,
DOCTOR.

22:08.417 --> 22:11.750
IT DOESN'T CONCERN YOU.

22:13.667 --> 22:15.834
HEY, DELL,
CAN YOU HAND CARRY

22:15.875 --> 22:18.417
STEVIE WALKER'S BLOOD
TO THE LAB FOR ME?

22:18.458 --> 22:21.667
PUT A RUSH ON IT. HAVE THEM
SCREEN FOR INGESTIBLE POISONS.

22:24.458 --> 22:27.041
HEY.
I JUST GOT THE TEST BACK
FROM THE STINSONS.

22:27.083 --> 22:29.041
THE O'BRIEN BABY
IS THEIR BABY.

22:29.083 --> 22:32.250
AND THE STINSON BABY
BELONGS TO THE O'BRIENS.

22:32.291 --> 22:33.959
YEP.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.417
HOW DO YOU TELL SOMEONE
THAT THEIR BABY WAS SWITCHED

22:36.458 --> 22:38.417
WITH ANOTHER BABY?

22:38.458 --> 22:40.417
DAMN IT.

22:40.458 --> 22:42.667
(sighs)

22:42.709 --> 22:45.709
(sobbing)

22:48.875 --> 22:50.834
(clears throat)

22:50.875 --> 22:52.834
WELL, THAT WAS
THE HARDEST THING

22:52.875 --> 22:54.375
I'VE EVER DONE.

22:54.417 --> 22:55.834
YOU DID EVERYTHING RIGHT.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.834
AND DAD DOESN'T SHED
A TEAR.

22:57.875 --> 23:00.709
HOW'S IT GOING
WITH NAOMI?

23:00.750 --> 23:02.625
WELL, YOU KNOW,
SO FAR, SO--

23:02.667 --> 23:05.041
(Duncan) DO YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU PUT MY WIFE THROUGH,

23:05.083 --> 23:07.041
WHAT YOU PUT US THROUGH?

23:07.083 --> 23:09.041
AND NOW YOU TELL US
THAT THIS--THIS OTHER BABY

23:09.083 --> 23:11.083
WHO WE'VE NEVER MET IS SICK!

23:11.125 --> 23:13.583
WE DID EVERYTHING
YOU ASKED US TO DO.

23:13.625 --> 23:17.041
I KNOW HOW HARD YOU TWO
WORKED TO GET PREGNANT.
LET DOWN AFTER LET DOWN,

23:17.083 --> 23:18.500
THE--THE MISCARRIAGES,
THE HORMONES...

23:18.542 --> 23:21.500
YOU HOW MANY SHOTS
I HAD TO STICK IN HER?

23:21.542 --> 23:24.000
SHE COULD HARDLY MOVE
SHE WAS SO BRUISED.

23:24.041 --> 23:26.000
I-I WISH THERE WAS
SOMETHING I COULD DO.

23:26.041 --> 23:28.000
YEAH, THERE IS SOMETHING
YOU CAN DO.

23:28.041 --> 23:30.000
YOU CAN START BY EXPLAINING
HOW YOU--

23:30.041 --> 23:32.083
HOW YOU CAN LIVE
WITH YOURSELF--

23:32.125 --> 23:34.125
TAKING OUR MONEY
AND PROMISING US

23:34.166 --> 23:36.500
A HEALTHY BABY.
DUNCAN, I NEVER
PROMISED YOU PERFECTION.

23:36.542 --> 23:40.291
I PROMISED YOU A CHILD.
MY RETIREMENT, VACATION PAY--
OUR FUTURE!

23:40.333 --> 23:43.041
(baby crying)
WE SPENT IT ALL SO WE
COULD HAVE OUR LITTLE GIRL!

23:43.083 --> 23:45.500
DUNCAN, PLEASE.
I WANT MY MONEY BACK.

23:45.542 --> 23:47.500
(crying continues)

23:47.542 --> 23:49.625
I WANT MY DAMN MONEY BACK!

23:49.667 --> 23:53.667
(crying continues)

23:53.709 --> 23:56.041
YOUR HUSBAND...

23:56.083 --> 23:59.542
HE HAS A RIGHT
TO BE ANGRY.

23:59.583 --> 24:01.625
SO DO YOU.

24:03.667 --> 24:05.917
I COULD
JUST TAKE SARAH AND GO.

24:05.959 --> 24:08.375
WE COULD JUST GO AWAY.

24:10.542 --> 24:12.041
NO ONE WOULD FIND US.

24:12.083 --> 24:14.208
EXCEPT YOU WON'T.

24:16.083 --> 24:18.792
BECAUSE EMILY
IS YOUR DAUGHTER.

24:18.834 --> 24:21.333
AND SHE IS SICK.

24:21.375 --> 24:25.542
AND A MOTHER NEVER LEAVES
HER CHILD BEHIND.

24:25.583 --> 24:28.000
NOT A STRONG MOTHER.

24:30.375 --> 24:31.750
NO.

24:31.792 --> 24:32.959
NO.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.250
THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.
I'M NOT GONNA DO IT.

24:35.291 --> 24:37.583
(sniffles) COME ON, BABY.

24:45.458 --> 24:48.959
HEY. STEVIE WALKER'S
LAB RESULTS.

24:50.417 --> 24:52.417
COPRINE?

24:52.458 --> 24:53.959
FROM THE MUSHROOM?

24:54.000 --> 24:56.333
INK CAP MUSHROOMS
CONTAIN COPRINE.

24:56.375 --> 24:58.834
IT'S LIKE A NATURAL FORM
OF ANTABUSE.

24:58.875 --> 25:01.834
WHEN YOU INGEST THE MUSHROOM,
THEN IF YOU DRINK ALCOHOL

25:01.875 --> 25:04.041
YOU GET REALLY--
REALLY, REALLY SICK.

25:04.083 --> 25:06.750
SO SOMEONE'S
POISONING STEVIE?

25:11.750 --> 25:13.750
(mouth full) ANY LUCK?

25:13.792 --> 25:16.166
WELL, I THINK WE KNOW
WHEN THE SWITCH HAPPENED.

25:16.208 --> 25:18.417
WE HAVE BABY EMILY'S
HOSPITAL RECORD

25:18.458 --> 25:21.375
AND BABY SARAH'S
HOSPITAL RECORDS,

25:21.417 --> 25:23.375
AND THEN ON DAY TWO,
THEY SWITCHED.

25:23.417 --> 25:26.625
EMILY BECOMES SARAH
AND SARAH BECOMES EMILY?

25:26.667 --> 25:28.417
WHAT ABOUT THIS NURSE,
LEFT TOWN?

25:28.458 --> 25:30.458
NO, SHE WAS IN THE E.R.
OF MY HOSPITAL,

25:30.500 --> 25:33.000
LAID OUT WITH THE FLU
HOOKED UP TO AN I.V. ALL NIGHT.

25:33.041 --> 25:34.959
SO WE'RE BACK
TO SQUARE ONE?

25:35.000 --> 25:37.875
MY PATIENT
IS BEING POISONED

25:37.917 --> 25:41.041
BY HIS OWN DEAR,
SWEET MOTHER.

25:41.083 --> 25:42.250
HMM.

25:42.291 --> 25:45.000
SHE'S DOSING HIM
WITH INK CAP MUSHROOMS.

25:45.041 --> 25:48.417
WHICH MEANS HE'S DRINKING--
BOOM, ON THE FLOOR.

25:48.458 --> 25:50.792
BABY SWITCH.
POISONING?

25:50.834 --> 25:53.083
FOR REAL? BABY--HI.

25:53.125 --> 25:55.250
YOU ARE NOT A MEMBER
OF THIS PRACTICE.

25:55.291 --> 25:58.041
SO YOU HAVE TO GO AHEAD
AND UNHEAR THAT.

25:58.083 --> 26:01.041
WOW. I THOUGHT
I HAD A PROBLEM.

26:01.083 --> 26:03.041
YEAH, WELL, MAYBE WE CAN
HELP YOU WITH YOURS

26:03.083 --> 26:04.792
SINCE WE'RE NOT
GETTING ANYWHERE.

26:04.834 --> 26:06.041
I-I DON'T KNOW.

26:06.083 --> 26:08.166
I-I GOTTA STOP THE MOTHER
FROM HURTING HER SON.

26:08.208 --> 26:10.083
NOW SHE'S ALSO POISONING
HER GRANDSON.

26:10.125 --> 26:12.834
BUT I CAN'T SEND HER TO JAIL,
CAN I?

26:12.875 --> 26:15.834
HOW COULD A PARENT
DO THAT TO A CHILD?

26:17.333 --> 26:20.500
LET ME SEE
THE VISITOR'S LOG AGAIN.

26:23.083 --> 26:25.250
HMM.

26:30.166 --> 26:31.709
YEAH.

26:31.750 --> 26:33.250
THE FIRST TWO DAYS,

26:33.291 --> 26:37.041
ONE PERSON
WAS THERE CONSTANTLY.

26:40.166 --> 26:44.709
A PARENT...
DID THAT TO A CHILD.

26:47.542 --> 26:49.542
WHAT YOU'RE DOING
IS A CRIME.

26:49.583 --> 26:51.834
YOU CAN'T GO AROUND
POISONING PEOPLE.

26:51.875 --> 26:53.542
NO, I ONLY MEANT IT
FOR DAVID.

26:53.583 --> 26:55.542
I DIDN'T KNOW STEVIE
WAS DRINKING.

26:55.583 --> 26:58.583
SO IT'S OKAY TO POISON
YOUR OWN SON?

26:58.625 --> 27:00.834
WELL, EVERY TIME HE TAKES
A DRINK, HE PAYS FOR IT.

27:00.875 --> 27:02.750
THAT'S HOW YOU TEACH
MY DAVID A LESSON.

27:02.792 --> 27:05.500
YOU HAVE TO STOP
DOING THIS, NOW.

27:05.542 --> 27:08.792
NO. MY FAMILY, WE'RE WEAK
WHEN IT COMES TO THIS.

27:08.834 --> 27:10.333
DAVID'S NOT WEAK.

27:10.375 --> 27:12.041
HE'S AN ALCOHOLIC.

27:12.083 --> 27:14.959
AND SOME OLD WORLD REMEDY

27:15.000 --> 27:17.041
WILL NOT GUARANTEE
THAT HE'LL STOP DRINKING.

27:17.083 --> 27:19.458
NOW I'M A DOCTOR,
AND I'M TELLING YOU--

27:19.500 --> 27:21.458
WHAT? YOU... (chuckles)

27:21.500 --> 27:23.166
YOU'RE LIKE
ALL THE OTHER DOCTORS.

27:23.208 --> 27:26.709
OH, YOU MAKE HIM GO
TO A 12-STEP GROUP,

27:26.750 --> 27:28.709
BUT DO YOU MAKE HIM
STOP DRINKING?

27:28.750 --> 27:30.959
NO. SO I DID.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.542
PLEASE.

27:32.583 --> 27:35.583
YOU CAN'T TELL DAVID.
THIS WILL WORK.

27:35.625 --> 27:38.583
AS DAVID'S DOCTOR,
I CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN.

27:38.625 --> 27:40.041
I'M SORRY.

27:40.083 --> 27:42.750
THEN YOU MIGHT AS WELL
HAVE ME ARRESTED.

27:42.792 --> 27:46.000
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
HOW LONG I'VE GOT,

27:46.041 --> 27:49.834
AND MY FAMILY
MEANS EVERYTHING.

27:49.875 --> 27:53.625
IF I DON'T PROTECT THEM,
WHO WILL?

27:57.250 --> 28:00.041
(Addison) FROM BIRTH YOUR BABY--
YOUR BIOLOGICAL BABY--

28:00.083 --> 28:02.041
WELL, IT WAS DIFFICULT.

28:02.083 --> 28:04.375
SHE HAD
A NEUROLOGICAL PROBLEM.

28:04.417 --> 28:05.959
SHE DID?

28:06.000 --> 28:09.041
YOUR C-SECTION CAUSED
SEVERE POST-LABOR PAIN,

28:09.083 --> 28:11.417
SO YOU WERE SEDATED FOR
MOST OF THE FIRST TWO DAYS.

28:11.458 --> 28:14.417
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN AWARE
OF HOW SERIOUS IT WAS.

28:14.458 --> 28:16.875
BUT YOU WERE, MR. STINSON.

28:16.917 --> 28:20.667
YOU WERE IN THE NURSERY 24/7.

28:20.709 --> 28:23.041
AND THEN WHEN YOUR DAUGHTER
WAS 2 DAYS OLD, SHE SEIZED

28:23.083 --> 28:24.792
WHILE YOU WERE HOLDING HER.

28:24.834 --> 28:27.417
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? WHAT--
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? I--

28:27.458 --> 28:29.417
SHE'S SAYING THAT
THE NEXT TIME YOU WERE

28:29.458 --> 28:32.041
IN THE NURSERY ALONE IS WHEN
THOSE BABIES WERE SWITCHED.

28:32.083 --> 28:34.250
(Addison)
YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE THERE.

28:34.291 --> 28:36.625
IT WOULD'VE BEEN EASY ENOUGH
TO SWITCH OFF

28:36.667 --> 28:40.041
YOUR BABY'S SECURITY BRACELET
BECAUSE SHE WAS SO SMALL.
NO, I'M NOT GONNA STAND
FOR THIS.

28:40.083 --> 28:41.250
IF I WERE
THAT BABY'S FATHER--

28:41.291 --> 28:44.375
MR. STINSON, PEOPLE'S LIVES
HAVE BEEN ALTERED--

28:44.417 --> 28:46.166
YOUR CHILD'S LIFE.

28:46.208 --> 28:49.041
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO TAKE CARE OF HER,

28:49.083 --> 28:51.500
AND INSTEAD YOU SWITCHED HER
BECAUSE SHE WAS SICK.

28:51.542 --> 28:53.875
