00:02.200 --> 00:04.487
My name is Oliver Queen.

00:04.880 --> 00:08.965
After five years in hell,
I have come home with only one goal:

00:09.400 --> 00:11.004
To save my city.

00:11.480 --> 00:13.687
Now others have joined my crusade.

00:13.840 --> 00:15.842
To them, I'm Oliver Queen.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.083
To the rest of Starling City,
I'm someone else...

00:19.240 --> 00:22.369
...I am something else.

00:22.880 --> 00:25.167
Previously on Arrow:

00:25.320 --> 00:27.721
I'm going to find whoever did this.

00:27.920 --> 00:31.402
There's something about Malcolm
that both you and Oliver need to know.

00:31.760 --> 00:32.761
Malcolm...

00:36.560 --> 00:38.927
I don't wanna hurt or get hurt.

00:39.080 --> 00:41.287
You seem like someone
who could teach me not to.

00:41.440 --> 00:43.363
You're my family, I need you.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.445
Looks like you're going home.

00:47.600 --> 00:49.125
Thea seem different to you?

00:51.800 --> 00:53.086
Where is she?

00:53.960 --> 00:56.566
Where is Sara?

00:57.320 --> 00:59.766
She came here for the League
two weeks ago.

00:59.920 --> 01:01.763
We've not heard from her since.

01:04.599 --> 01:06.204
There's something I have to tell you.

01:10.920 --> 01:12.649
Sara's dead?

01:21.600 --> 01:23.443
I'm so sorry.

01:24.520 --> 01:26.284
It was an arrow, wasn't it?

01:26.480 --> 01:27.481
How do you know that?

01:29.680 --> 01:30.727
Where's her body?

01:31.560 --> 01:33.722
- Nyssa.
- Where?

01:34.000 --> 01:36.367
We buried her in her grave
from seven years ago.

01:47.520 --> 01:48.681
She knows something.

01:49.240 --> 01:51.846
I want you to follow her. But be careful.

01:52.560 --> 01:54.005
I have to meet Thea.

02:00.840 --> 02:02.330
Hi.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.161
Sorry I'm late.

02:04.320 --> 02:05.845
Late is your "on time," Ollie.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.003
So much for my promise
that things would be different, right?

02:09.160 --> 02:10.161
Relax. It's fine.

02:10.320 --> 02:11.651
Dinner is on me.

02:11.800 --> 02:12.847
With what money?

02:13.280 --> 02:15.009
Aren't you broke?

02:15.160 --> 02:16.810
Um...

02:17.000 --> 02:20.402
- Aren't you?
- Not so much, actually.

02:20.560 --> 02:24.326
Uh, when I decided to come back,
I had no idea what I wanted to do...

02:24.480 --> 02:26.687
...and realized I kind of missed the club.

02:26.840 --> 02:30.606
And turns out, a lot of
other people do too.

02:30.760 --> 02:32.250
I have investors.

02:32.400 --> 02:36.121
And, uh, they're gonna help me buy back
the foundry from Queen Consolidated.

02:36.280 --> 02:38.362
I'm thrilled for you. That's fantastic.

02:40.320 --> 02:42.243
You seem changed.

02:42.800 --> 02:44.450
Stronger.

02:44.640 --> 02:46.404
After last year, I...

02:46.840 --> 02:49.889
- ...don't see any other way I could've turned out.
- And that's it?

02:51.000 --> 02:53.810
You're not seeing someone or...?

02:55.320 --> 02:57.721
I'm hoping Roy didn't put you up
to asking that.

02:57.880 --> 03:00.690
No, I'm just trying to figure out
why you're so different.

03:01.360 --> 03:03.966
How about just being
my big brother instead?

03:05.280 --> 03:06.645
Okay.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.402
Target's on the move. He's headed north.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.323
- He stopped.
- What's he doing?

03:25.680 --> 03:26.727
He's buying ice cream.

03:28.280 --> 03:30.123
He doesn't look like a terrorist.

03:30.280 --> 03:33.887
- The best ones never do.
- Why does Waller want me to take this guy out?

03:34.520 --> 03:37.364
Too many questions.
Follow orders and eliminate the target.

03:37.520 --> 03:39.090
Or is this one of your best friends too?

03:39.280 --> 03:43.205
Oh, so I'm just a gun that she can point
at things she doesn't like?

03:43.360 --> 03:44.885
That's exactly what you are.

03:50.160 --> 03:53.528
- He's moving.
- Best not to waste time, then.

04:06.880 --> 04:07.927
Nyssa.

04:35.040 --> 04:39.250
You have my condolences.
And that of my father, Ra's al Ghul.

04:39.400 --> 04:42.529
I don't want your condolences.

04:42.680 --> 04:45.206
And I definitely don't want your father's.

04:48.920 --> 04:51.810
She died with arrows in her chest.

04:51.960 --> 04:54.486
You think that would've happened
if she hadn't met you?

04:56.320 --> 04:58.766
You were the one
that showed her the darkness inside.

04:58.920 --> 05:01.491
You and your father.

05:01.640 --> 05:03.563
I know you grieve.

05:03.880 --> 05:05.120
But so do I.

05:06.800 --> 05:09.849
I didn't show Sara the darkness, Laurel.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.480
It was already inside of her when we met.

05:13.720 --> 05:20.569
When I found her, alone, starving
and terrified, I protected her.

05:21.560 --> 05:26.009
I took Sara into my heart
and I loved her with all of my soul.

05:28.440 --> 05:30.488
And that jacket...

05:31.640 --> 05:34.325
...I gave it to Sara as a gift.

05:35.680 --> 05:38.081
You are not fit to wear it.

05:41.720 --> 05:43.848
- She's moving.
- Where?

05:44.000 --> 05:45.490
She went to visit Sara's grave.

05:45.640 --> 05:48.120
Now she's on the top floor
of some dump on Amsterdam.

05:48.320 --> 05:51.324
Could be where she's crashing.
League's safe house or something.

05:51.480 --> 05:52.845
Text me the address.

06:21.160 --> 06:22.446
Are you ready to talk?

06:25.160 --> 06:27.640
We've nothing to discuss.

06:28.440 --> 06:31.330
The trail for Sara's killer has gone cold.

06:32.600 --> 06:33.931
And I could use your help.

06:34.120 --> 06:35.360
Whereas I don't need yours.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.249
Really?

06:37.400 --> 06:40.449
We've gathered evidence,
we're working leads.

06:40.600 --> 06:43.729
You're visiting cemeteries
and hiding in League safe houses.

06:43.920 --> 06:46.161
I am not hiding.

06:47.080 --> 06:51.051
And this is not my safe house.
It was Sara's while she was in Starling.

07:05.120 --> 07:07.122
These were her favorites.

07:14.320 --> 07:15.685
Okay.

07:18.080 --> 07:21.129
You said Sara was in Starling
for the League.

07:21.280 --> 07:24.966
- That suggests her target is also her killer.
- Agreed.

07:25.120 --> 07:27.122
Except it wasn't a target.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.362
Sara came to Starling to confirm rumors.

07:29.520 --> 07:31.727
Whispers,
that an enemy of the League was here.

07:31.880 --> 07:35.089
- Who?
- Malcolm Merlyn.

07:36.160 --> 07:37.207
He's alive.

07:47.480 --> 07:49.801
Merlyn was a member
of the League of Assassins.

07:49.960 --> 07:52.327
My father released him
from his obligation to us...

07:52.480 --> 07:55.962
...with the understanding
he would abide by its code of conduct.

07:56.480 --> 07:58.448
You guys are professional killers.

07:58.600 --> 08:00.523
That is a pretty low bar.

08:00.680 --> 08:03.809
Merlyn's undertaking
violated the League's principles.

08:04.560 --> 08:07.131
When you killed him,
we considered the matter settled.

08:07.280 --> 08:10.682
But we received word from a reliable source
that Merlyn faked his demise.

08:11.120 --> 08:12.929
- What source?
- Oliver's mother.

08:13.600 --> 08:17.446
Yeah, well, Oliver's mom
wasn't exactly known for her honesty.

08:17.640 --> 08:22.043
No offense. I just can't believe that a guy
everyone thinks was dead suddenly isn't.

08:22.200 --> 08:24.202
Neither did I.

08:24.480 --> 08:26.005
Then we found these.

08:28.480 --> 08:30.084
Sara took them two weeks ago.

08:33.960 --> 08:36.042
Didn't the police find his body?

08:36.240 --> 08:38.163
Merlyn had resources all over Starling.

08:38.320 --> 08:41.085
I'm willing to bet one of them
was in the coroner's office.

08:41.240 --> 08:46.041
Since learning Merlyn was alive, the
League has hunted him all over the globe.

08:46.240 --> 08:49.642
Running down every rumor,
following every whisper.

08:49.840 --> 08:52.366
And one of those whispers
put Merlyn back in Starling.

08:52.560 --> 08:53.686
She tracked him here.

08:53.880 --> 08:55.609
We're gonna retrace her steps.

08:55.800 --> 08:58.280
- You said you found evidence on her person?
- Yes. Roy.

08:58.440 --> 09:00.841
We found a blank piece of paper
in Sara's boot.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.401
But why would she be carrying
a blank piece of paper?

09:04.120 --> 09:05.804
Do you have a flame?

09:13.440 --> 09:14.930
Unbelievable.

09:15.160 --> 09:17.925
My father had a notebook
with hidden writing just like this.

09:18.080 --> 09:20.970
A notebook he received from Merlyn,
I imagine.

09:21.160 --> 09:24.767
This is ghost ink, one of the means
the League employs for concealing secrets.

09:24.920 --> 09:26.331
It's Sara's handwriting.

09:26.480 --> 09:28.562
Notes from her surveillance of Merlyn.

09:28.720 --> 09:31.610
- There's not much to go on here.
- There's a couple of things.

09:31.760 --> 09:33.444
"Jansen," question mark.

09:37.280 --> 09:39.681
"Dad help," question mark.

09:41.040 --> 09:42.326
Sara reached out to Lance.

09:42.480 --> 09:44.608
If Lance knew Merlyn was alive,
he would've told you.

09:44.760 --> 09:46.205
Only if she told him.

09:47.480 --> 09:51.166
- What matters is what he told her.
- And how do we find that out?

09:53.600 --> 09:55.045
So, gentlemen, word of advice.

09:55.200 --> 09:58.966
Next time you arrest a bookie, please make
sure the chief is not one of his clients.

09:59.160 --> 10:03.529
That's what the chief told me to tell you. As
far as I'm concerned, keep doing yourjobs.

10:03.680 --> 10:06.763
First round tonight's on me.
Please get out of here.

10:06.920 --> 10:09.321
- Buying rounds?
- Oh, buying love.

10:09.480 --> 10:12.051
Fastest way to a cop's heart,
through his liver.

10:12.200 --> 10:13.725
How are you feeling?

10:13.920 --> 10:15.684
I'm fine. Do you have a minute?

10:15.880 --> 10:19.202
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I have to talk to you.

10:19.360 --> 10:22.887
It's about Sara. She, um...

10:23.960 --> 10:25.246
She called me.

10:25.400 --> 10:27.528
She said that she was looking
into something.

10:27.680 --> 10:29.284
Something called Jansen?

10:31.800 --> 10:33.370
Um...

10:35.720 --> 10:37.882
Uh, yeah, someone.

10:38.040 --> 10:39.849
Ken Zhi Jansen.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.561
I hooked her up with his last
known address. Sara was here.

10:44.240 --> 10:47.244
She asked me not to say anything to you,
and I... I should have.

10:47.400 --> 10:49.289
Maybe I should have. I'm sorry.

10:49.440 --> 10:52.205
It's okay. She was...

10:52.480 --> 10:54.642
- She's in a mysterious line of work.
- Oh, yeah.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.446
- One I hope you're not getting mixed up with.
- No.

10:58.600 --> 11:00.170
I'm just doing Sara a favor.

11:03.240 --> 11:04.287
And her?

11:07.960 --> 11:09.200
I'll be right back.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.968
What are you doing here?

11:17.200 --> 11:20.409
Oliver told me of his plan to involve you
in the hunt for Sara's killer.

11:20.560 --> 11:22.130
I have a handle on it.

11:22.320 --> 11:24.049
Your father doesn't know, does he?

11:24.240 --> 11:26.083
No, he doesn't.

11:26.240 --> 11:30.040
- And he can't, he has a heart condition.
- He has the right to avenge his daughter.

11:30.200 --> 11:33.204
- It's none of your business.
- Sara was everything I hold dear in this life.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.762
- It is every bit my business.
- What would she say if she were here?

11:36.960 --> 11:39.930
I almost didn't recognize you
without your Halloween costume.

11:40.960 --> 11:42.007
Sara back in town too?

11:43.160 --> 11:45.322
No, she is not.

11:47.800 --> 11:50.963
But she told me to tell you
that she misses you very much.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.163
The address I gave your sister for Jansen.

11:57.360 --> 12:00.603
Now, she promised me there wouldn't be any,
you know, assassinating.

12:00.760 --> 12:02.000
That still the case?

12:02.160 --> 12:06.688
I assure you, Mr. Lance,
the only objective here is justice.

12:17.080 --> 12:19.447
This was the next lead
Sara was gonna follow?

12:19.600 --> 12:21.204
Jansen's a Buddhist monk.

12:21.360 --> 12:23.840
Nine years ago,
he was facing deportation to China.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.604
Merlyn bankrolled his defense.

12:25.800 --> 12:28.690
Jansen returns the favor
by giving Merlyn asylum in his garden.

12:28.840 --> 12:32.208
Monastery. We should divide our forces,
take up flanking positions.

12:32.360 --> 12:34.442
I agree. But not...

12:36.680 --> 12:39.331
Never understood
what Sara saw in her in the first place.

12:39.480 --> 12:41.528
Split up. But be careful.

12:41.680 --> 12:42.886
Copy that.

13:49.640 --> 13:51.927
Oliver, we found Jansen.

13:52.640 --> 13:53.801
Negative.

13:55.200 --> 13:56.361
I have eyes on him.

13:57.680 --> 14:00.490
Whoever is up there is not Jansen.

14:05.200 --> 14:06.440
Jansen Sensei.

14:06.600 --> 14:09.604
I am Nyssa, daughter of Ra's al Ghul,
heir to the Demon.

14:09.760 --> 14:13.287
You will tell me where I can find Merlyn
or I will kill you where you sit.

14:20.760 --> 14:22.330
Hello, Nyssa.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.565
Where is he?

14:50.480 --> 14:51.811
What's going on?

14:51.960 --> 14:54.042
Did you find Sara's killer?

14:57.440 --> 14:58.885
We have a suspect.

14:59.080 --> 15:00.525
Malcolm Merlyn is alive.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.407
Sara was here looking for him.

15:03.720 --> 15:05.609
We think he found her first.

15:05.760 --> 15:08.161
- And where is he now?
- We're working on that.

15:08.320 --> 15:10.527
He got away from us earlier tonight.

15:10.960 --> 15:14.646
But not before I hit him with an arrow
laced with particulate nanotechnology.

15:14.800 --> 15:18.441
Felicity wrote a program
that tracks the nanites using GPS.

15:18.640 --> 15:20.244
- A tracer arrow.
- Yeah.

15:21.120 --> 15:23.521
You had a shot at Merlyn
and you didn't kill him?

15:23.680 --> 15:26.411
- I tagged him.
- With a flesh wound.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.086
He's marked.

15:28.560 --> 15:31.040
Nowhere in the world he can go
where I can't find him.

15:31.240 --> 15:32.480
And when you do?

15:33.800 --> 15:37.407
- I'm not a killer anymore, Laurel.
- Merlyn is.

15:37.560 --> 15:41.565
He killed Tommy
and 502 other innocent people.

15:42.200 --> 15:44.521
How many are gonna have to die
before you put him down?

15:44.680 --> 15:47.684
- You think that's what your sister would want?
- Yes.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.291
I do.

15:53.800 --> 15:54.961
Let me speak with her.

16:01.360 --> 16:04.091
- Merlyn may try to contact Thea.
- I'm on it.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.565
The tracer arrow program.

16:09.360 --> 16:12.569
You have Felicity monitoring remote
from Central City?

16:12.720 --> 16:14.722
No, she told me an idiot could run it.

16:15.320 --> 16:18.130
I will try very hard
not to take that personally.

16:19.400 --> 16:20.640
I'll be on the streets.

16:20.800 --> 16:23.406
- Talk me in when you have his location.
- Copy that.

16:49.760 --> 16:51.524
It's done.

16:53.440 --> 16:54.487
Laurel.

16:54.640 --> 16:58.281
I just found out Malcolm Merlyn isn't
only alive, but that he killed my sister.

16:58.440 --> 17:01.284
I'm sure you can understand
why I don't wanna talk right now.

17:01.440 --> 17:03.329
I understand.

17:03.880 --> 17:06.486
I loved her too.

17:10.960 --> 17:12.644
I'm sorry for your loss.

17:13.640 --> 17:15.881
I promised Sara...

17:16.040 --> 17:18.008
...and I promise you...

17:18.160 --> 17:20.083
...we will find Malcolm Merlyn.

17:21.640 --> 17:24.040
Apparently, you already did.

17:24.319 --> 17:26.003
And Oliver should've killed him.

17:26.160 --> 17:27.207
Yes.

17:31.720 --> 17:37.727
If Oliver catches up with Merlyn,
he's going to let him live or let him go.

17:38.480 --> 17:40.767
You can't let that happen.

17:41.080 --> 17:44.482
You need to get Merlyn.

17:44.640 --> 17:46.722
You have to do whatever it takes.

17:57.280 --> 17:58.566
Hey.

17:58.760 --> 18:01.286
Grand re-opening
is not for another three weeks.

18:01.440 --> 18:03.408
Looks like you still got
a lot more work to do.

18:03.880 --> 18:05.041
Need some help?

18:05.200 --> 18:08.329
Uh, thanks, but I don't really think
that's a good idea.

18:08.520 --> 18:12.491
Just as friends and former co-workers.

18:16.040 --> 18:21.126
Bonsai green, October mist, or avocado?

18:26.480 --> 18:29.211
- Merlyn stopped. I got his position.
- Go.

18:29.360 --> 18:34.161
Air-conditioner factory, 18th and Milson.
You want me to share this with Nyssa?

18:34.320 --> 18:37.130
No. She'll put an arrow in him
before I get any answers.

18:37.280 --> 18:38.327
Agreed.

18:48.960 --> 18:51.486
This place is empty.
He's not here, Diggle.

18:51.640 --> 18:53.961
Hello, Oliver. You're absolutely right.

18:54.520 --> 18:57.205
I'm not at the...
What is it, the air-conditioning factory?

18:57.400 --> 19:00.085
It's a neat trick you have.
Sorry it didn't work out.

19:00.280 --> 19:01.406
When I find y0u...

19:01.560 --> 19:04.404
You absolutely will. We need to talk.

19:04.560 --> 19:07.530
But I prefer a venue less conducive
to conflict.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.524
Nelson Plaza at Goldwater and Fifth.
Bottom of the stairs.

19:10.680 --> 19:12.489
It's a very public place.

19:12.640 --> 19:14.324
You'll wanna leave your mask behind.

19:15.240 --> 19:16.890
This should remain between the two of us.

19:17.040 --> 19:22.490
So if I even see one of your associates,
I promise you, you will not see me.

19:43.200 --> 19:46.170
Hello, Oliver. How are you?

19:47.280 --> 19:50.124
You've accomplished a lot with this city,
I see.

19:50.280 --> 19:52.169
I'm not here to discuss Starling.

19:52.320 --> 19:55.449
- You think I killed Sara Lance.
- How else would you know she's dead?

19:55.800 --> 19:59.407
These streets were mine
long before you laid claim to them.

19:59.560 --> 20:01.801
This is still my city.

20:02.200 --> 20:05.010
I chose this place
because crowds equal invisibility.

20:05.160 --> 20:08.642
Besides, I understand
you're not killing people these days.

20:08.800 --> 20:10.404
I'm considering making an exception.

20:10.680 --> 20:13.809
Ra's al Ghul has placed
a blood bounty on my head.

20:14.040 --> 20:18.364
Why would I try to get it lifted by killing the
love of his daughter's life? It's illogical.

20:18.520 --> 20:20.568
Sara comes back to Starling.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.883
You come back to Starling.
Sara's murdered.

20:24.040 --> 20:28.284
I came back for the simplest
Thea.

20:28.760 --> 20:30.489
Six months ago, during the siege...

20:30.640 --> 20:35.168
...she was almost killed by one of...
One of Slade Wilson's Mirakuru soldiers.

20:35.320 --> 20:38.051
- I protected her.
- You're lying.

20:38.200 --> 20:40.248
Thea made it out before the attack.

20:40.400 --> 20:41.925
Unfortunately, she didn't make it out.

20:42.080 --> 20:44.526
But you wouldn't know that
because you were out being...

20:44.720 --> 20:47.724
What are you calling yourself these days?
"The Arrow."

20:48.240 --> 20:51.528
That was the night I realized
that Thea needs me.

20:51.680 --> 20:52.886
Stay away from her.

20:53.400 --> 20:55.050
Don't worry.

20:55.200 --> 20:57.601
I've kept my distance.

20:58.640 --> 21:02.850
Oh. But the world is a dangerous place.

21:03.440 --> 21:05.681
And you're too distracted to protect her.

21:05.840 --> 21:07.808
- You're a killer.
- Yes, I am.

21:07.960 --> 21:12.761
But I swear, I swear to
you on Thea's life...

21:14.160 --> 21:17.084
...I am not Sara Lance's killer.

21:33.160 --> 21:36.164
From the look on your face,
you need something stronger than coffee.

21:36.320 --> 21:39.802
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, are you?

21:39.960 --> 21:44.090
Back in Corto Maltese, I promised you
there would be no more secrets...

21:44.280 --> 21:45.361
...no more lies.

21:45.560 --> 21:48.211
And I'm trying to honor that.

21:48.360 --> 21:50.442
Okay.

21:52.480 --> 21:56.166
I learned something last night
that's gonna be difficult for you to hear.

21:56.680 --> 22:03.211
I think that it's what Mom was trying to
tell us the night she died, right before it.

22:06.160 --> 22:09.209
The night of the siege,
you were at the train station.

22:09.520 --> 22:11.443
Yeah, l...

22:11.720 --> 22:13.165
It wasn't fun.

22:13.320 --> 22:16.847
I got attacked
by one of those crazy masked things...

22:17.000 --> 22:19.162
...and he tried to strangle me.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.402
But he got shot by a cop, I think.

22:23.600 --> 22:24.681
Did you see him?

22:26.600 --> 22:28.090
No.

22:29.240 --> 22:30.480
Why are you asking?

22:31.320 --> 22:33.721
It wasn't a cop, Thea.

22:35.360 --> 22:37.089
It was Malcolm Merlyn.

22:41.600 --> 22:43.364
He's dead.

22:44.920 --> 22:46.251
How do you know this?

22:46.400 --> 22:48.562
One of Sara's friends saw him.

22:49.360 --> 22:50.566
She's sure.

22:52.920 --> 22:56.686
If he was gonna try to contact you,
he would've done it by now, okay?

22:56.840 --> 22:59.730
Thank you for telling me.

23:02.200 --> 23:06.205
It's, uh, one of my investors. I...

23:08.040 --> 23:10.042
Are you okay?

23:11.520 --> 23:14.683
Yeah. I'm... I'm fine. l...

23:14.840 --> 23:17.127
It's like you said,
if he was gonna contact me...

23:17.280 --> 23:19.169
...he probably would've done it by now.

23:31.240 --> 23:34.289
- Where's Oliver?
- Out, taking care of some family business.

23:34.440 --> 23:36.408
As if there weren't more pressing matters
at hand.

23:36.600 --> 23:39.444
He's not doing nothing.
He tracked down Merlyn last night.

23:39.640 --> 23:41.290
Did he kill him?

23:41.480 --> 23:42.766
No.

23:43.480 --> 23:47.166
- He swore to me he didn't kill Sara.
- And you know all of his words are lies.

23:47.360 --> 23:48.407
I believe him.

23:48.760 --> 23:52.287
Because he swore to me
on his daughter's life.

23:57.080 --> 24:00.482
We had heard rumors
Merlyn fathered another child.

24:00.840 --> 24:03.002
We couldn't confirm them.

24:05.760 --> 24:07.922
- You know who it is.
- I do.

24:08.280 --> 24:12.251
If you put me through the effort
of finding out on my own...

24:13.480 --> 24:17.007
...I might have to exact a price
from whoever it is you're protecting.

24:17.200 --> 24:21.524
It's Thea.
My sister is Merlyn's daughter.

24:25.320 --> 24:28.608
And that is the reason
he came back to Starling City.

24:28.760 --> 24:30.125
Because she did.

24:30.320 --> 24:31.526
He's protecting her.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.924
And that is why you spared Merlyn, twice.

24:35.080 --> 24:36.650
It had nothing to do with that.

24:38.200 --> 24:43.764
He explained to me, in his own twisted way,
that he loves her.

24:44.320 --> 24:46.641
And then he swore to me on her life.

24:46.800 --> 24:51.601
And I swore an oath of my own that I would
see Sara's killer brought to justice.

24:51.800 --> 24:52.881
Nyssa.

24:53.040 --> 24:55.122
- Nyssa!
- Oliver, wait.

24:55.280 --> 24:57.009
- We have to stop her.
- Do we?

24:57.160 --> 25:00.642
Listen, I understand why you can't
kill Merlyn, all of the reasons.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.162
- Maybe he killed Sara, maybe he didn't.
- He didn't.

25:04.320 --> 25:08.564
Either way, the world is a better place
without Malcolm Merlyn in it.

25:08.720 --> 25:11.405
You made a vow not to kill.

25:12.040 --> 25:13.280
Nyssa didn't.

25:21.400 --> 25:22.731
Where's your wife?

25:22.880 --> 25:25.565
Tatsu? She needed to be someplace else.

25:25.720 --> 25:27.563
She doesn't like me.

25:27.760 --> 25:28.921
You're wrong.

25:29.080 --> 25:30.161
She hates you.

25:30.920 --> 25:33.321
She's not happy that I'm here.

25:33.480 --> 25:34.561
Neither am I.

25:37.480 --> 25:39.801
I killed a man today.

25:40.760 --> 25:42.250
I don't even know the reason.

25:43.360 --> 25:47.888
- Sometimes it's better that way.
- What, blindly following orders is better?

25:48.040 --> 25:50.088
I'm not blind, Oliver.

25:50.280 --> 25:53.443
I'm focused on what's most important.

25:54.040 --> 25:55.451
You should do the same.

25:55.880 --> 25:58.850
It's not our place or burden
to know why we carry out our missions.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.571
I didn't realize having a conscience
was a burden.

26:12.600 --> 26:14.090
What are you playing?

26:14.240 --> 26:15.287
A reading game.

26:15.440 --> 26:17.090
Oh, yeah? Do you mind if I try?

26:17.240 --> 26:19.049
I wanna work on my Cantonese.

26:19.200 --> 26:21.248
Dad said I shouldn't let you
use my computer.

26:21.400 --> 26:24.290
Okay. Why don't we make a deal, then?

26:24.440 --> 26:26.442
You don't have anything. You're a burn.

26:27.720 --> 26:31.964
Well, this bum has something
that you don't have.

26:32.120 --> 26:33.884
Height.

26:34.040 --> 26:38.489
That stash of candy that your parents keep
in the cupboard above the fridge?

26:39.440 --> 26:41.647
- I'll swipe you two pieces.
- Five.

26:41.840 --> 26:43.888
- Three.
- Five.

26:44.080 --> 26:45.969
Fine, five. Give me the computer.

26:55.360 --> 26:56.850
I need a meet with Waller.

26:57.600 --> 27:00.490
- How did you...? Akio...
- it's not his fault.

27:00.680 --> 27:02.648
I need a meet, make it happen.

27:02.800 --> 27:06.964
- Wailer's gonna want a reason.
- Ferris Air flight 637.

27:07.120 --> 27:08.849
She'll know what I mean.

27:09.520 --> 27:12.330
Thanks for your help.
You really didn't have to do that.

27:12.520 --> 27:16.081
I like painting.
Actually, it helps me turn my brain off.

27:16.240 --> 27:18.004
It feels kind of Zen.

27:18.160 --> 27:20.606
Actually, I wish you were
still trying to get into my pants...

27:20.760 --> 27:25.641
...because this "Zen, helpful Roy" thing
is really freaking me out.

27:36.440 --> 27:37.680
Get away from him.

27:37.880 --> 27:40.850
- I'm not here for him.
- Thea.

27:55.080 --> 27:58.050
Thea. Thea, are you here?

28:12.120 --> 28:14.726
So Malcolm Merlyn is alive
and Thea's father.

28:14.920 --> 28:16.604
Anything else you haven't told me?

28:16.760 --> 28:19.570
- What'd you get at the precinct?
- Not much.

28:19.720 --> 28:21.882
But I did get this off a traffic camera.

28:22.120 --> 28:24.202
It was recorded 10 minutes ago.

28:24.360 --> 28:28.410
After I struck out on anything related to
Nyssa or Thea, I just looked for strange.

28:28.600 --> 28:31.251
Well, that definitely counts.

28:32.960 --> 28:35.088
Sara, she never said much
about the League...

28:35.240 --> 28:38.084
...but she said their communication system
was outdated.

28:38.240 --> 28:40.811
- Smoke signal.
- Nyssa's sending Malcolm a message.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.445
I'm willing to bet my wallet...

28:42.600 --> 28:46.321
...that means "we got your daughter."
Video gives me her location.

28:46.520 --> 28:49.444
- You mean "us," right?
- No, I need you to secure the perimeter.

28:49.600 --> 28:51.648
- Can't risk Thea seeing you.
- Copy that.

28:52.400 --> 28:53.970
She knows I know about the Arrow.

28:54.120 --> 28:56.646
Not with a dose of League tranquilizer
in your system.

28:58.440 --> 29:01.011
Oliver, this is my fault.

29:01.160 --> 29:02.764
I told Nyssa to go after Merlyn.

29:02.920 --> 29:05.491
- I told her to do whatever it takes.
- It's okay.

29:05.680 --> 29:07.569
I know you're not a killer.

29:07.960 --> 29:09.803
But he is.

29:09.960 --> 29:13.169
Whatever else he means to you or Thea...

29:15.280 --> 29:16.611
...know that.

29:25.080 --> 29:28.607
I'm gonna get free of this
and when I do, I'm gonna kill you.

29:28.760 --> 29:31.286
I apologize for involving you in this.

29:31.440 --> 29:33.124
My quarrel's with your father.

29:33.280 --> 29:36.489
My father's been dead for years,
you crazy psycho bitch.

29:36.640 --> 29:37.641
Not Robert Queen.

29:37.800 --> 29:41.805
Your true father, al-Saher, the magician.

29:41.960 --> 29:44.201
Known to the uninitiated
as Malcolm Merlyn.

29:44.360 --> 29:47.045
Then you know what he's gonna do to you
when he gets here.

29:47.200 --> 29:48.326
I know he'll die.

29:48.480 --> 29:51.484
My father taught me ways to cut a man
to make his death last for days.

29:51.680 --> 29:54.729
- Sounds like father of the year.
- My father may be the Demon...

29:55.800 --> 29:57.165
...but yours is the devil.

30:04.960 --> 30:06.610
Run!

30:11.160 --> 30:13.731
Apparently, we both
handle grief differently.

30:37.720 --> 30:40.929
There's a misunderstanding
the three of us need to clear up.

30:41.120 --> 30:44.522
A conversation I'm eager to have
over your rotting corpse.

31:13.200 --> 31:14.440
Do it, Oliver.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.280
He killed Sara...

31:18.360 --> 31:19.646
...Tommy.

31:20.040 --> 31:21.804
He will corrupt your sister.

31:24.720 --> 31:26.802
There is blood on my hands.

31:26.960 --> 31:29.611
Almost too much to contemplate.

31:30.400 --> 31:31.890
But none of it is Sara's.

31:32.320 --> 31:33.446
Kill him!

31:33.600 --> 31:34.965
I did not kill your beloved!

31:36.320 --> 31:40.723
Your father doubted Sara's loyalties
the moment you brought her home.

31:42.240 --> 31:46.211
You know your father,
what he is capable of.

31:46.600 --> 31:48.921
He will kill without hesitation.

31:49.080 --> 31:50.844
Do you really need me to tell you...

31:51.000 --> 31:54.129
...what he'd do to the degenerate
who'd steal his daughter's heart?

32:05.960 --> 32:08.486
Nyssa doesn't believe me, Oliver.

32:09.800 --> 32:12.007
If you don't believe me...

32:12.480 --> 32:14.448
...listen to her.

32:15.320 --> 32:16.651
Kill me.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.523
You may not have killed Sara...

32:32.840 --> 32:34.683
...but you're still a murderer.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.490
What are you gonna do?

32:38.680 --> 32:40.011
Arrest me?

32:40.160 --> 32:43.846
I could have S.C.P.D. here
in three minutes.

32:44.000 --> 32:47.527
And in half that time, I will escape
from whatever prison they put me in.

32:47.680 --> 32:49.489
You know that, so does she.

32:49.640 --> 32:53.531
We were trained by the League,
no prison can hold us!

32:54.360 --> 32:56.681
Not even your one on Lian Yu.

32:58.400 --> 33:03.088
Which leaves you with only one option.

33:05.520 --> 33:07.522
To break your vows...

33:08.560 --> 33:09.607
...and kill me.

33:12.280 --> 33:14.806
Kill your sister's father.

33:28.240 --> 33:29.890
- Is Thea okay?
- I spoke to her.

33:30.040 --> 33:32.725
She's fine.
Doesn't know who took her or why.

33:38.720 --> 33:40.051
I may have deserved that.

33:40.240 --> 33:42.049
You deserve worse.

33:42.200 --> 33:43.486
Um, what's going on?

33:43.640 --> 33:46.291
Merlyn didn't kill Sara.

33:46.440 --> 33:48.408
Which means whoever did
is still out there.

33:49.080 --> 33:51.082
You're a fool...

33:51.240 --> 33:53.242
...who insults the memory of a woman
he once loved.

33:53.400 --> 33:58.406
I will honor Sara's memory by finding
and punishing the person who did this.

33:58.920 --> 34:00.081
The real person.

34:01.920 --> 34:03.490
Nyssa.

34:05.000 --> 34:09.608
So long as Malcolm Merlyn is in my city,
the League will make no move on him.

34:10.239 --> 34:11.969
He's under my protection.

34:12.400 --> 34:14.687
You would incur the wrath
of the League of Assassins?

34:14.880 --> 34:20.603
I would do what I have to
in order to buy the time necessary...

34:20.760 --> 34:23.206
...to find out what really happened
with Sara.

34:23.400 --> 34:25.607
You have made an enemy tonight.

34:26.159 --> 34:28.606
One with a long memory.

34:31.600 --> 34:33.125
Oliver.

34:37.840 --> 34:38.887
Are you sure?

34:39.040 --> 34:41.202
If I wasn't sure,
I never would have let him go.

34:42.400 --> 34:45.130
- I promise.
- What did I miss?

34:49.199 --> 34:50.884
I hate Hong Kong.

34:51.040 --> 34:52.849
And I hate trans-Pacific flights.

34:53.000 --> 34:57.961
And do not even get me started on the topic
of being summoned by one of my operatives.

34:58.120 --> 35:01.647
Ferris Air flight 637,
Paris to Hong Kong nonstop.

35:01.800 --> 35:04.326
You prevented that flight
from being shot down over Lian Yu.

35:04.480 --> 35:07.324
- Were you watching me?
- Via Keyhole Hexagon satellite.

35:07.640 --> 35:11.804
How else was I supposed to know
you possess the capabilities I require?

35:12.000 --> 35:15.368
That business with the freighter last year.

35:15.640 --> 35:17.642
Impressive. Are we done?

35:17.840 --> 35:21.322
Just getting started, actually.
Adam Castwidth.

35:23.160 --> 35:24.366
The man you had me murder.

35:25.200 --> 35:27.851
He was Edward Fyers' handler.

35:28.000 --> 35:31.004
- And he worked for you.
- You're out of your depth, Mr. Queen.

35:31.160 --> 35:32.207
I don't think that I am.

35:32.400 --> 35:35.210
I think Mr. Castwidth had a USB drive
detailing everything.

35:35.400 --> 35:37.846
I think he knew you told Fyers
to shoot the plane down.

35:38.000 --> 35:42.528
- And I think that you wanted him silenced.
- And the world thinks you dead, Mr. Queen.

35:43.200 --> 35:46.886
The convenient thing about dead men
is that no one tends to believe them.

35:47.080 --> 35:50.846
What about dead men who make arrangements
to get the information on that USB drive...

35:51.040 --> 35:53.964
...in the hands of every blogger
and journalist in this hemisphere?

35:54.120 --> 35:56.088
If anything happens to Maseo's family...

35:56.240 --> 36:00.040
...you're gonna spend a long time testifying
in front of the Senate subcommittee.

36:00.200 --> 36:05.161
The world's a much more complicated place
than you realize.

36:05.760 --> 36:11.051
Edward Fyers thought he was to shoot down that
plane to destabilize the Chinese economy.

36:11.800 --> 36:14.087
In truth, I wanted to
take out a single target.

36:14.240 --> 36:19.087
So you blow up a plane full of
innocent people to take out one man?

36:19.280 --> 36:22.568
No, to take out one woman.

36:23.040 --> 36:24.280
Chien Na Wei.

36:26.720 --> 36:30.088
Two years ago,
we had our only chance at her.

36:30.600 --> 36:32.568
And you saved her life.

36:32.720 --> 36:36.930
And now she's in Hong Kong.
I need to know why.

36:46.480 --> 36:48.528
I thought you were going back
to your father.

36:48.720 --> 36:51.007
I felt I owed you a goodbye.

36:51.160 --> 36:53.925
I intend to make good on my promise
to Sara.

36:54.080 --> 36:55.605
And to you.

36:56.960 --> 36:59.566
It kills me that he's still out there.

36:59.920 --> 37:01.445
Merlyn.

37:01.600 --> 37:03.284
Someone.

37:04.360 --> 37:05.407
It kills me.

37:05.920 --> 37:07.206
It pains me as well.

37:10.200 --> 37:12.362
I see you've been training.

37:12.560 --> 37:13.766
And wearing her jacket.

37:13.960 --> 37:16.531
If you're gonna stand there and tell me
I'm not strong enough...

37:16.680 --> 37:19.604
...please don't.

37:20.800 --> 37:22.689
Back at the cemetery, I would have.

37:24.600 --> 37:29.288
But since, you've reminded me that the
strongest metal is forged in the hottest fire.

37:29.440 --> 37:31.090
And what's that supposed to mean?

37:34.480 --> 37:36.881
Don't forget to turn your hips.

37:38.800 --> 37:41.087
It's where the power comes from.

37:47.680 --> 37:49.523
It's Sara, leave a message.

37:49.680 --> 37:52.081
Sara, sweetie, it's, uh...

37:52.240 --> 37:55.449
It's me. Look, I... I know you said
only call this number in an emergency.

37:55.600 --> 37:59.047
And it's not, it's not, everything is fine.
But I just...

38:00.640 --> 38:02.324
I just wanna hear your voice.

38:03.680 --> 38:05.967
I know wherever you are,
you're looking after yourself...

38:06.120 --> 38:08.248
...but, you know,
that doesn't mean I don't worry.

38:08.400 --> 38:09.561
So, you know...

38:09.760 --> 38:11.762
Don't... No need to call me back
or anything.

38:11.920 --> 38:14.002
I just want you to remember...

38:16.040 --> 38:17.690
...that I love you.

38:27.240 --> 38:28.526
Are you okay?

38:28.680 --> 38:30.523
It's not my first time being kidnapped.

38:30.680 --> 38:34.127
It's not what I meant.
I never imagined you and scrubbing.

38:34.280 --> 38:36.089
Unless a spa treatment was involved.

38:37.960 --> 38:40.566
I spoke to Detective Lance.

38:40.720 --> 38:43.041
He doesn't think that woman
is gonna bother you again.

38:43.200 --> 38:45.885
Why did she come after me
in the first place?

38:46.040 --> 38:48.646
Maybe she thought
the Queens still had money.

38:49.400 --> 38:50.561
I Wish.

38:50.760 --> 38:53.366
But thank you for checking in on me.

38:53.720 --> 38:55.927
I'm always gonna watch out for you.

38:56.080 --> 38:57.206
Always.

38:58.360 --> 39:01.045
Sorry, guys, I didn't mean to interrupt.

39:01.200 --> 39:02.884
I was just leaving.

39:03.040 --> 39:04.883
Take care of yourself.

39:08.880 --> 39:12.726
- I thought you had guys for that.
- It's kind of Zen.

39:12.880 --> 39:16.282
You got that same worried look on your face
my brother had.

39:16.440 --> 39:18.488
Really, I'm fine.

39:19.200 --> 39:20.645
Good.

39:20.800 --> 39:23.087
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.

39:23.240 --> 39:25.402
And I wanted to apologize.

39:25.560 --> 39:26.925
I'm sorry I couldn't stop her.

39:30.120 --> 39:33.010
You tried. Really.

39:33.400 --> 39:35.402
Those were some nice moves back there.

39:36.800 --> 39:40.646
Whatever you're doing with the Arrow
is clearly paying off.

39:41.120 --> 39:44.363
Maybe I should apply for a job here
as one of your bouncers.

39:44.520 --> 39:46.602
I think I got that covered.

39:46.760 --> 39:50.446
But I could use an assistant manager.

39:52.320 --> 39:53.367
For real?

39:53.520 --> 39:55.966
I need somebody who knows the place
as well as I do.

39:58.040 --> 39:59.201
Absolutely.

39:59.360 --> 40:02.284
- Purely platonic.
- Understood.

40:06.120 --> 40:07.884
Oh, it's my designer, Kurt.

40:08.040 --> 40:09.451
I should probably take this.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.480
- Hi.
- Are you safe?

40:15.280 --> 40:16.805
I am now.

40:17.280 --> 40:20.011
- Is that woman gone?
- For now.

40:20.160 --> 40:22.811
- And your brother?
- He's completely in the dark.

40:22.960 --> 40:24.803
He doesn't know a thing.

40:24.960 --> 40:27.804
But thank you, Dad.

40:27.960 --> 40:29.485
For what?

40:30.120 --> 40:31.485
For taking care of me.

40:31.960 --> 40:33.962
I promised you, Thea...

40:34.160 --> 40:37.209
...I will never let anyone hurt you.

40:54.160 --> 40:56.322
The rumors were true.

40:56.720 --> 40:58.768
Malcolm Merlyn is in Starling City.

40:59.120 --> 41:01.851
There is a sadness in your voice.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.162
Ta-er al-Sahfer.

41:06.440 --> 41:07.726
She has fallen.

41:07.880 --> 41:09.848
Sara Lance is dead?

41:10.000 --> 41:11.445
Yes.

41:12.600 --> 41:14.728
Struck through the heart with an arrow.

41:15.400 --> 41:17.368
At Merlyn's hand?

41:17.520 --> 41:19.010
It appears.

41:20.400 --> 41:23.370
I have vowed a blood oath to avenge her.

41:23.520 --> 41:26.251
Al-Saher will face the League's justice.

41:27.080 --> 41:29.606
But for his crimes against our code.

41:29.840 --> 41:33.208
- But Sara...?
- Was never truly one of us.

41:36.320 --> 41:38.049
What of Queen?

41:39.040 --> 41:41.407
He has sworn to protect Merlyn at any cost.

41:42.040 --> 41:43.929
If that is true...

41:44.080 --> 41:47.687
...then Oliver Queen courts war with us.
