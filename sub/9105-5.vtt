Ah, you were doing something
you shouldn't have been...

00:10.594 --> 00:12.767
<i>You went out
to be with another woman.</i>

00:12.930 --> 00:13.772
Listen, Jules...

00:13.931 --> 00:15.524
If you were...

00:15.682 --> 00:16.899
she can have you.

00:17.059 --> 00:18.356
Just go.

00:18.519 --> 00:20.317
<i>What's going on with you two?</i>

00:20.479 --> 00:22.072
<i>It's my family life.</i>

00:22.231 --> 00:24.154
<i>It's none of your business.</i>

00:25.943 --> 00:28.412
Ronnie Morgan...

00:28.570 --> 00:30.197
<i>he came in here last night.</i>

00:30.364 --> 00:32.287
<i>He grabbed the blade,
twisted the knife</i>

00:32.448 --> 00:34.122
- right out of my hand.
<i>- We've had no trouble</i>

00:34.284 --> 00:35.877
<i>with Ronnie
since he arrived here?</i>

00:36.036 --> 00:38.755
No, none at all, but if
he's off his medication...

00:38.914 --> 00:40.882
<i>If something bad
happened, it means that</i>

00:41.041 --> 00:43.419
<i>the police are gonna make sure
you and I are separated.</i>

00:43.585 --> 00:45.508
I will never let
that happen to you.

00:45.671 --> 00:47.093
<i>Is this the hotel that</i>

00:47.256 --> 00:48.724
<i>- Bill Pettigrew stayed in?</i>
<i>- Who?</i>

00:48.882 --> 00:50.350
The fella
who was eaten by a bear.

00:50.509 --> 00:52.887
I think it is.

00:53.053 --> 00:56.933
<i>What other illicit
connections should I know about?</i>

00:57.099 --> 01:01.730
<i>Let's start with wind chimes
and infidelity.</i>

01:01.895 --> 01:03.863
Why do you find my being
here so threatening?

01:04.022 --> 01:05.990
I don't
find you threatening.

01:06.149 --> 01:08.243
<i>Should</i> I find you
threatening?

01:08.402 --> 01:11.497
I think Frank Sutter is the man
they should be looking at.

01:11.655 --> 01:12.998
<i>Sutter was in Afghanistan.</i>

01:13.156 --> 01:14.453
<i>Terrible things happen there.</i>

01:14.616 --> 01:16.835
Terrible things happen here.

01:16.994 --> 01:19.213
<i>We found human blood all
over Frank Sutter's T-shirt.</i>

01:19.371 --> 01:22.750
<i>Couldn't just
keep him there, Dan.</i>

Glaciers...

Frank Sutter.

In the hotel.

In the shower.

05:43.468 --> 05:44.685
Oh, God.

05:44.845 --> 05:47.473
Punched his head off the wall.

05:47.639 --> 05:49.516
Why?

05:51.560 --> 05:53.608
We found blood
on his clothes.

Charlie's blood?

05:55.605 --> 05:57.073
Don't know.

05:59.401 --> 06:02.280

Yes.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.464

Yes.
What was he doing

07:11.139 --> 07:13.312
He was having a shower.

Yeah, of course

This is very bad.

07:51.513 --> 07:54.312
It's bad for Frank, and
it's bad for me, too.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.852

Hey.

08:17.789 --> 08:20.167
Stay there.

08:28.842 --> 08:31.436
Does he have
to be handcuffed?

08:31.594 --> 08:33.972
I arrested him on
suspicion of murder.

08:34.139 --> 08:35.561
He resisted arrest.

08:35.724 --> 08:37.726
The murder
of Charlie Stoddart?

08:37.892 --> 08:39.735
And you punched him?

08:39.894 --> 08:41.020
That's right.

08:41.187 --> 08:43.110
How many times
did you punch him?

08:43.273 --> 08:45.025
A number of times.

08:45.191 --> 08:47.193
Hard blows?

08:47.360 --> 08:48.282
Hard enough.

08:48.445 --> 08:49.913
Did he defend himself?

08:52.115 --> 08:54.163
What do you mean?

08:54.325 --> 08:57.795
Was he insensible
when you punched him?

08:57.954 --> 09:00.798
Did his head rotate sharply?

09:00.957 --> 09:03.801
He hit his head
against the wall--

09:03.960 --> 09:05.212
also hard--

09:05.378 --> 09:07.096
when I punched him.

09:19.350 --> 09:20.772
You fucker!

09:24.689 --> 09:26.612
That fucker attacked me.

09:27.942 --> 09:29.819
You have to leave.

09:38.620 --> 09:40.463
<i>He reacted.</i>

09:40.622 --> 09:42.670
He resisted.

09:42.832 --> 09:44.675
No, he reacted.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.836
He was naked.
He was in the shower.

09:47.003 --> 09:48.880
Sheriff Anderssen
barged in.

09:49.047 --> 09:50.344
He reacted.

09:50.507 --> 09:52.009
Resisted.

09:52.175 --> 09:54.052
He was punched and
shoved repeatedly.

09:54.219 --> 09:56.472
No formal caution was made.
You can't be sure about this.

09:56.638 --> 09:58.481
Yes, I can-- I was there;
I witnessed it.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.813
I saw the whole thing.
This is a car crash.

10:00.975 --> 10:02.602
Professor Stoddart

10:02.769 --> 10:04.521
was hacked apart.

10:04.687 --> 10:06.530
If Dan had justification

10:06.689 --> 10:08.783
for suspecting
Frank Sutter did that,

10:08.942 --> 10:10.444
then he had good reason to use

10:10.610 --> 10:12.112
overwhelming force
in the arrest.

10:12.278 --> 10:14.326
Are you trying to persuade me,
Governor,

10:14.489 --> 10:16.287
or are you rehearsing
for a judge?

10:16.449 --> 10:18.076
Look, if your sheriff

10:18.243 --> 10:19.711
is anywhere near
those interviews,

10:19.869 --> 10:22.839
all the interview evidence
will be deemed inadmissible.

10:22.997 --> 10:25.466
You're a lawyer;
you should know that.

10:27.418 --> 10:29.466
You want to conduct
the interviews.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.097
Yes, I do.

10:49.107 --> 10:53.328
<i>To identify whose blood
is on Frank's T-shirt,</i>

10:53.486 --> 10:55.079
we need to make
a DNA comparison.

10:55.238 --> 10:57.661
I don't have time to send
samples to the mainland.

10:57.824 --> 11:01.169
I don't have the equipment
or the necessary skills.

11:04.581 --> 11:08.006
What about the biology department
at the Research Institute?

11:08.168 --> 11:10.671
Stoddart's department.
They would need tissue

11:10.837 --> 11:12.680
from Professor
Stoddart as well.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.887
An eyebrow follicle--
that is usually

11:15.049 --> 11:17.677
what we send to the forensic
lab on the mainland.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.187
It doesn't hurt

11:19.345 --> 11:22.349
when you yank it
out of the head.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.062
Although, obviously,

11:24.225 --> 11:25.568
in this case...

12:00.136 --> 12:03.185
I made sandwiches
for everyone.

12:03.348 --> 12:04.941
I had to do something.

12:05.099 --> 12:06.191
I know.

12:06.351 --> 12:08.649
You don't know.

12:10.772 --> 12:12.615
Who did you arrest?

12:12.774 --> 12:15.027
At the hotel?

12:15.193 --> 12:17.491
Frank Sutter.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.915

12:21.074 --> 12:22.621

12:24.786 --> 12:27.630
Eric...

12:27.789 --> 12:30.918
Tell me.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.588

12:34.754 --> 12:37.007

12:37.173 --> 12:41.019

13:49.078 --> 13:51.376

13:56.002 --> 13:58.471
Match the blood on
the T-shirt to Stoddart,

13:58.629 --> 14:01.303
and we have him.

14:01.466 --> 14:04.060

14:12.101 --> 14:14.229
I'm not going to stand aside.

14:14.395 --> 14:15.647
Morton will do the interviews.

14:15.813 --> 14:17.611
You can't be present.

14:17.774 --> 14:20.027
You assaulted
Frank Sutter.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.945
He killed Charlie.

14:26.908 --> 14:28.706
If he's the killer,

14:28.868 --> 14:31.462
then he could go free
because of you.

14:31.621 --> 14:33.669
Do you understand this?

15:00.316 --> 15:02.614
Thank you.

15:06.322 --> 15:08.825
There you go.

15:08.991 --> 15:11.494
I'm famished.

15:11.661 --> 15:13.459

15:13.621 --> 15:15.589
Mmm.

15:16.833 --> 15:19.211
You not hungry?
I'm okay.

15:19.377 --> 15:21.755
Do you not like ribs?
No, I do--

15:21.921 --> 15:23.969

they're just a bit too...

15:25.466 --> 15:26.968
...chest cavity.

15:28.136 --> 15:30.685
I'm sorry.

15:30.847 --> 15:31.598
Natalie.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.732
I need you to do

15:33.891 --> 15:36.314
a quantitative PCR
on some fluid stains.

15:36.477 --> 15:38.479
And then a capillary
electrophoresis.

15:38.646 --> 15:39.898
We'd like you to
cross-check it

15:40.064 --> 15:42.112
with the DNA from
an eyebrow follicle.

15:42.275 --> 15:43.618
Is this a blood swab?
Yes.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.028
Whose blood?

15:45.194 --> 15:47.367
That is what we have
to establish and...

15:47.530 --> 15:49.077
as fast as we can.

15:49.240 --> 15:51.789
The professor's?

15:51.951 --> 15:55.000
I'm not allowed to say.

15:55.163 --> 15:58.542
The lab's not forensically
accredited, is it? No.

15:58.708 --> 16:01.131
Any results that we give
you wouldn't be admissible

16:01.294 --> 16:02.967
as evidence.
I understand.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.678
But we just need to know
if there's a blood match.

16:06.841 --> 16:08.468
Five, six hours, tops.

16:08.634 --> 16:10.136
We'll have a result
for you in five.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.522
Okay.

16:16.767 --> 16:19.361
Red wine or white wine?

16:19.520 --> 16:21.648
That is the conundrum.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.067
Exactly. ls it meat or fish?

16:24.233 --> 16:26.406
I decided that...

16:26.569 --> 16:30.244
rosé would be a
suitable compromise.

16:30.406 --> 16:33.000
My mum is gonna
have kittens.

16:33.159 --> 16:37.380
She resolutely refuses
to embrace any non-British grub.

16:37.538 --> 16:39.085
She does that whole
expat Marmite

16:39.248 --> 16:41.171
and baked bean thing.
Well,

16:41.334 --> 16:43.428
I think if you can swallow
Marmite,

16:43.586 --> 16:45.634
then you can manage minke whale.

16:45.796 --> 16:47.798
Okay, just don't tell her
it's whale, Markus.

16:47.965 --> 16:49.842
See if she likes it
and then say.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.852
Okay.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.854
Want some stew, Mum?

16:54.013 --> 16:56.186
Hmm?

16:56.349 --> 16:58.647
Thank you.

17:00.228 --> 17:02.071
Oh, hello, Markus.

17:02.230 --> 17:03.482
Doc.

17:03.648 --> 17:07.198
Markus has brought a starter.

17:08.319 --> 17:10.992
So, Margaret.

17:11.155 --> 17:15.410
I hear you were brought in
to check up on Frank Sutter.

17:15.576 --> 17:17.829
I'm not surprised
they arrested him.

17:17.994 --> 17:19.838
He's a violent man.

17:19.997 --> 17:22.500
I don't talk
about my patients.

17:22.666 --> 17:24.044
Shirley is the one for gossip.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.463
Oh, you're wrong
about that.

17:26.628 --> 17:28.631
Shirley
doesn't gossip.

17:28.798 --> 17:30.391
She tells everybody what
is happening in town.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.473
She doesn't exaggerate
or embellish,

17:32.635 --> 17:34.683
and everybody trusts her.

17:34.845 --> 17:36.847
I noticed this, and
I understood something,

17:37.014 --> 17:38.857
something quite
exceptional.

17:39.016 --> 17:43.271
In this town, your daughter is
the one person everybody loves.

17:51.946 --> 17:53.823
How's your whale, Mum?

18:20.850 --> 18:23.023
<i>Taq</i> polymerase.

18:23.185 --> 18:28.567
This is going
into PCR for four hours.

18:28.733 --> 18:29.985
Can you prep
the eyebrow follicle?

18:30.151 --> 18:32.119
We'll run it alongside.
Yep.

18:32.278 --> 18:35.532
They do not look right,
these reindeer fetuses.

18:35.698 --> 18:36.950
What is wrong with them?

18:37.116 --> 18:39.164
It's hermaphroditism.

18:39.327 --> 18:42.957
Male and female sex organs
developing simultaneously.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.715
They're all
spontaneous aborts.

18:44.874 --> 18:47.969
What is causing this?
Well,

18:48.127 --> 18:49.970
that's what we're working
to find out.

18:58.929 --> 19:01.398
<i>Are you in any pain, Frank?</i>

19:09.565 --> 19:10.817
Did you know Professor
Charles Stoddart?

19:10.983 --> 19:13.077
No.
You never met him?

19:13.235 --> 19:15.329
Never.
Okay.

19:15.488 --> 19:17.536
Didn't know him, never met him,
didn't kill him.

19:17.698 --> 19:21.453
Can you tell me how your
T-shirt got covered in blood?

19:21.619 --> 19:23.292
My little boy was sick.

19:23.454 --> 19:26.128
Dr. Allerdyce diagnosed mumps.

19:26.290 --> 19:29.134
Liam had been sick in bed
for two days.

19:29.293 --> 19:32.638
Friday night I was at home
with him all evening.

19:32.797 --> 19:34.799
Mm-hmm. I went to his
bedroom to check on him.

19:34.965 --> 19:37.559
He'd gotten up out of bed
and was lying on the floor.

19:37.718 --> 19:40.016
I picked him up. I noticed
that the swelling in his throat

19:40.179 --> 19:41.897
had gone down
and he was covered in blood.

19:42.056 --> 19:43.899
The swelling had ruptured.

19:44.058 --> 19:46.060
I carried him
to the bathroom.

19:46.227 --> 19:48.571
He was dopey,
half-awake.

19:48.729 --> 19:50.231
I put him
in the shower,

19:50.398 --> 19:52.651
checked him all over.

19:52.817 --> 19:56.697
He started talking for the first
time since he'd been ill.

19:56.862 --> 19:59.786
I gave him a wash
and put him back to bed.

19:59.949 --> 20:01.792
The T-shirt I was wearing
was covered in blood.

20:01.951 --> 20:04.204
It was ruined,
so I threw it in the bin.

20:04.370 --> 20:07.044
Didn't think about it.
It was just a T-shirt.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.550
Jules came home.

20:09.709 --> 20:12.963
Liam was seeming a lot better.

20:13.129 --> 20:16.099
She made macaroni and cheese
for the three of us.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.688
So the blood

20:22.847 --> 20:24.895
that was all over the T-shirt,
then, was your son's blood?

20:25.057 --> 20:28.186
Yes. Okay. So where did
that blood come from?

20:28.352 --> 20:30.525
From lacerations,
from cuts, from... what?

20:30.688 --> 20:32.941
I told you,
the swelling had ruptured.

20:33.107 --> 20:34.233
The swelling in
his throat...

20:34.400 --> 20:36.027
Yes.
had ruptured?

20:36.193 --> 20:38.070
Yes.

20:39.363 --> 20:42.207
That's a lot of blood.

20:42.366 --> 20:45.711
What's your point? Well, the point is
that that's so much blood and then

20:45.870 --> 20:48.714
the bleeding ceased,
just out of the blue,

20:48.873 --> 20:51.046
which is unusual.

20:51.208 --> 20:53.506
But he was hemorrhaging,

20:53.669 --> 20:55.512
and then it just stopped.

20:55.671 --> 20:57.264
And then he was fine,

20:57.423 --> 20:59.221
and then he ate
macaroni and cheese.

20:59.383 --> 21:01.260
That's unusual.

21:06.807 --> 21:09.026
Why did you leave the Army?

21:09.185 --> 21:12.109
I'd done five years
in Afghanistan.

21:12.271 --> 21:15.115
I missed my wife.
I missed my son.

21:15.274 --> 21:16.947
So you brought them here.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.361
That's right.

21:18.527 --> 21:20.621
But now you and your wife
are separated.

21:20.780 --> 21:23.909
And that's none
of your business.

21:24.074 --> 21:26.122
Fair enough.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.665
You know, I look
at pictures of, uh,

21:30.831 --> 21:33.584
helicopter squadrons
in the British Army,

21:33.751 --> 21:36.504
and I see all these
white, freckled...

21:36.670 --> 21:39.344
uh, Hooray Harry...

21:39.507 --> 21:41.350
or Henry or
whatever-whatever it is...

21:41.509 --> 21:44.683
fellas, you know, British
Army officer class.

21:44.845 --> 21:46.438
But what I...
You know what I don't see?

21:46.597 --> 21:48.144
I don't see black faces.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.980
I don't see you.

21:50.142 --> 21:53.396
So it's very impressive
that you, uh, achieved

21:53.562 --> 21:56.236
the status that you
did in the Army.

21:56.398 --> 21:59.151
You have a glowing
commendation

21:59.318 --> 22:02.037
from your superior
officer here.

22:02.196 --> 22:04.324
But then,
out of the blue...

22:04.490 --> 22:08.245
you have a central
retinal vein occlusion,

22:08.410 --> 22:11.664
and you go blind
while you were flying.

22:15.876 --> 22:17.549
So you didn't choose
to leave the Army.

22:17.711 --> 22:19.759
You were discharged.

22:22.049 --> 22:23.892
Yeah.

22:24.051 --> 22:27.396
Well, that must have
been very frustrating.

22:27.555 --> 22:30.650
I mean, all that achievement,
all that hard work,

22:30.808 --> 22:33.231
all those years, just gone
in the blink of an eye.

22:33.394 --> 22:35.647
No pun intended.

22:35.813 --> 22:37.065
It has never reoccurred.

22:37.231 --> 22:38.904
And doctors say,
with the medication I take,

22:39.066 --> 22:40.659
it never will.

22:40.818 --> 22:43.196
But it wasn't on your medical
records when you applied

22:43.362 --> 22:45.035
for search and
rescue here, was it?

22:45.197 --> 22:47.700
Look, there is no connection
between me leaving the Army

22:47.867 --> 22:49.710
and Stoddart getting killed.
None.

22:49.869 --> 22:52.463
Well, the DNA test
will give us a result,

22:52.621 --> 22:54.294
and either it will
be your son's blood

22:54.456 --> 22:57.710
and you'll be released to
pursue a, uh, wrongful arrest

22:57.877 --> 23:00.676
and assault charge against
Sheriff Anderssen,

23:00.838 --> 23:03.011
or it will be Stoddart's blood

23:03.173 --> 23:05.141
and you'll be charged
with his murder.

23:05.301 --> 23:07.929
Well, DNA doesn't lie,
does it?

23:08.095 --> 23:09.597
You're right.

23:09.763 --> 23:12.733
It never does.

23:18.439 --> 23:20.282
Hey.
Hey.

23:20.441 --> 23:22.569
Did the search of the house
give us anything?

23:22.735 --> 23:24.237
No, nothing.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.121
Right, we need
to bring in the wife.

23:28.157 --> 23:30.034
She's staying with her son
all the time.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.668
He's very sick.

23:31.827 --> 23:34.706
What the hell
am I gonna tell her?

23:39.168 --> 23:41.842
Is Trish okay?

23:42.004 --> 23:44.257
No, Hildy,
Trish is not okay.

23:44.423 --> 23:46.300
She's in pieces.

23:56.393 --> 23:59.146
<i>Frank has said
that he found Liam</i>

23:59.313 --> 24:01.941
on the floor of his bedroom,
covered in blood.

24:03.859 --> 24:05.702
And that was why

24:05.861 --> 24:08.910
Frank's T-shirt
was covered in blood.

24:12.159 --> 24:14.457
Did you not know that?

24:14.620 --> 24:15.872
No.

24:16.038 --> 24:17.460
Frank didn't tell you

24:17.623 --> 24:19.717
that your son had
bled all over himself?

24:19.875 --> 24:21.593
No.

24:25.422 --> 24:27.720
Why do you think he
didn't tell you that?

24:32.596 --> 24:37.318
Uh... Frank didn't say anything
about any blood.

24:37.476 --> 24:40.275
We-we went...

24:40.437 --> 24:44.192
We took Liam to the hospital
when he started to scream.

24:44.358 --> 24:46.861
Why was he screaming?

24:47.027 --> 24:49.530
'Cause he...
'cause he had frostbite.

24:49.697 --> 24:52.120
- Frostbite?
- Where

24:52.282 --> 24:54.580
did he have frostbite?

24:54.743 --> 24:57.121
Uh, on his feet.

24:57.287 --> 24:59.836
On his feet? How did he get
frostbite on his feet?

24:59.999 --> 25:01.842
He must have gone outside.
But how?

25:02.001 --> 25:03.719
Where were you
when he went outside?

25:03.877 --> 25:07.256
I'd left the house.
I'd left him with Frank.

25:08.549 --> 25:11.143
What time was this?

25:12.511 --> 25:14.684
Se-Seven-ish.

25:17.433 --> 25:19.606
But Frank was
at home with Liam?

25:22.187 --> 25:24.440
Uh...

25:26.442 --> 25:28.661
Yeah...

25:28.819 --> 25:29.911
Yes or no?

25:41.999 --> 25:45.299
Frank went out.

25:47.963 --> 25:50.386
<i>You lied about that night.</i>

25:50.549 --> 25:52.677
Friday night.

25:54.928 --> 25:57.181
Between 7:00

25:57.347 --> 25:58.724
and 7:30, you went out.

25:58.891 --> 26:00.689
You left the house, and went...

26:02.269 --> 26:03.737
...and you met a woman.

26:05.230 --> 26:09.076
Who was the woman that you met?

26:13.363 --> 26:15.457
Frank,

26:15.616 --> 26:17.163
the woman that you met--

26:17.326 --> 26:20.000
who was she?

26:23.999 --> 26:25.842
Elena Ledesma.

26:28.545 --> 26:30.138
The woman I met
was Elena Ledesma.

26:30.297 --> 26:32.015
Where did you go
and what did you do?

26:32.174 --> 26:34.597
Excuse me.

26:34.760 --> 26:37.730
We went to an empty building,
and we fucked.

26:58.784 --> 27:01.333
Dad? Dad?

27:01.495 --> 27:03.372
Dad?

27:03.539 --> 27:04.791
What?

27:04.957 --> 27:06.379
There's this thing outside.

27:06.542 --> 27:08.215
What?

27:08.377 --> 27:10.675
Wait. Wait.
Shh, shh.

27:39.658 --> 27:41.956
Dad?

27:47.583 --> 27:49.506
Dad?

27:55.090 --> 27:57.184
Hey, it's all right.

27:57.342 --> 27:59.470
It's just a reindeer,
chewing on our guy ropes.

27:59.636 --> 28:01.889
He got a bigger fright
than I did.

28:06.476 --> 28:08.695
Carrie,

28:08.854 --> 28:11.858
if there's reindeer around, that
means there won't be any bears.

28:12.024 --> 28:16.450
Not for miles
and miles and miles.

28:16.612 --> 28:18.706
Now, that means we're safe.

28:18.864 --> 28:21.117
Safe and snug,

28:21.283 --> 28:23.285
watched over by the reindeer.

28:25.454 --> 28:27.957
Come on.
Come and have a look. Come on.

28:29.333 --> 28:31.256
Come on.
Come and have a look.

28:33.503 --> 28:36.723
There. You see?

28:36.882 --> 28:40.386
There's nothing there.

28:40.552 --> 28:42.475
Come on.
Come on, get inside.

28:49.269 --> 28:51.522
<i>You must have been young when</i>

28:51.688 --> 28:53.440
you had Liam.

28:53.607 --> 28:56.781
I was 17...

28:56.944 --> 28:59.197
and he was so sweet to me.

28:59.363 --> 29:02.333
He completely convinced me
to marry him and have the baby.

29:03.784 --> 29:06.583
My mum didn't approve.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.340
So didn't...

29:15.045 --> 29:21.018
You said you'd... airlift Liam
if he didn't get any better.

29:21.176 --> 29:23.474
Yes, I did.

29:25.764 --> 29:28.187
That's the most kind
and considerate thing

29:28.350 --> 29:32.196
anybody said to me since
we got off the plane.

29:32.354 --> 29:35.528
You're a good man, Dan.

29:52.708 --> 29:54.301
Excuse me, Jules.

29:59.006 --> 30:01.384
Thank you
for coming, Elena.

30:03.427 --> 30:05.646
Governor Odegard
and DCI Morton

30:05.804 --> 30:08.432
have some questions
they want to ask you.

30:08.598 --> 30:11.021
Ingrid will show you
to the interview room.

30:12.352 --> 30:14.650
I know where
the interview room is.

30:37.836 --> 30:41.181
She's so beautiful.

30:41.340 --> 30:45.641
<i>What did you do when you
went to Frank's house that night?</i>

30:45.802 --> 30:48.055
I...

30:49.431 --> 30:51.308
I threw a snowball
at his window.

30:51.475 --> 30:53.694
Why?

30:53.852 --> 30:56.105
To make him come to the window

30:56.271 --> 30:57.989
so he could see me and...

30:58.148 --> 30:59.525
follow me.

30:59.691 --> 31:01.944
Where did you
want to lead him?

31:02.110 --> 31:04.238
A car repair workshop.

31:04.404 --> 31:06.202
Why did you want
to take him there?

31:06.365 --> 31:08.663
Um...

31:11.453 --> 31:14.753
That morning, I met his wife,
where I work,

31:14.915 --> 31:17.794
and her little boy was ill,

31:17.959 --> 31:22.510
so I... I made a decision
I wouldn't be with Frank.

31:22.672 --> 31:24.470
And I just wanted to talk to him

31:24.633 --> 31:28.183
and tell him that we weren't
going to be together again.

31:30.055 --> 31:32.353
So, you told him that.

31:34.893 --> 31:38.739
Well, I wanted
to tell him... that,

31:38.897 --> 31:40.740
but it didn't work out.

31:40.899 --> 31:43.493
In what way?

31:46.154 --> 31:48.657
He told us that you had sex.

31:51.159 --> 31:53.082
He's telling you the truth.

31:53.245 --> 31:55.589
Okay, but you said
that you went there

31:55.747 --> 31:57.715
to see him to
break up with him.

31:57.874 --> 32:00.878
But instead, we had sex.

32:01.044 --> 32:03.342
You changed your mind?

32:08.343 --> 32:10.641
Okay.

32:12.764 --> 32:15.893
Is your relationship with
Dan Anderssen also sexual?

32:17.686 --> 32:20.690
No.

32:20.856 --> 32:23.234
No, I have no relationship
with him.

32:23.400 --> 32:26.199
No.

32:27.571 --> 32:29.289
That's good.

32:41.460 --> 32:43.508
When Sheriff Anderssen
arrested Frank Sutter,

32:43.670 --> 32:45.263
he arrested him
in your hotel room.

32:45.422 --> 32:46.674
Mm-hmm.

32:46.840 --> 32:48.717
He was in the shower.

32:48.884 --> 32:50.136
And you

32:50.302 --> 32:52.225
got between them?

32:52.387 --> 32:54.264
Yes.

32:54.431 --> 32:58.402
Why do you think they
had that violent confrontation?

32:58.560 --> 33:00.779
Why do you think
the sheriff was...

33:00.937 --> 33:02.689
so violent?

33:03.982 --> 33:06.235
I don't know.

33:06.401 --> 33:08.995
I don't know
what's in the sheriff's mind.

33:10.947 --> 33:12.949
Are you afraid
to talk about this?

33:13.116 --> 33:14.459
No.

33:14.618 --> 33:16.370
Are you frightened
to talk to me?

33:16.536 --> 33:17.913
No.

33:18.079 --> 33:19.296
Good. That's good.

33:24.961 --> 33:27.214
Excuse me.

33:40.060 --> 33:42.813
She says
she doesn't have a relationship

33:42.979 --> 33:45.402
with Sheriff Anderssen.
So, she doesn't.

33:48.151 --> 33:50.028
Was there
some other connection?

33:58.245 --> 34:01.215
Could you get me
her file, please?

34:01.373 --> 34:03.421
What file?

34:03.583 --> 34:06.336
The file that you have on her.

34:09.089 --> 34:11.888
It's in Dan's desk.

34:12.050 --> 34:14.348
Well, could you get it?

34:23.143 --> 34:24.235
Fuck you.

34:40.370 --> 34:43.623
Eight years ago,
Ricardo Scelsi.

34:43.790 --> 34:45.507
Stabbed through the right eye.

34:45.667 --> 34:47.920
Cause of death-- scissors...

34:48.085 --> 34:50.554
into the brain.

34:50.714 --> 34:54.059
Stabbed directly through
the orbit of the right eye.

34:54.217 --> 34:56.469
Yes.

34:56.636 --> 34:59.059
Your fingerprints
were on the scissors,

34:59.222 --> 35:01.771
as were the fingerprints
of your lover.

35:01.933 --> 35:03.480
Yes.

35:03.643 --> 35:06.863
But nobody knows which one
of you killed Ricardo Scelsi.

35:07.022 --> 35:09.650
Nobody.
You do.

35:09.816 --> 35:11.614
Nobody knows.

35:13.653 --> 35:17.374
Esmeralda is a beautiful name.

35:18.742 --> 35:21.086
I'm Elena now.

35:21.244 --> 35:24.248
You can change your name,

35:24.414 --> 35:25.916
you can change where you live,

35:26.082 --> 35:27.584
go someplace
where no one knows you,

35:27.751 --> 35:29.674
no one recognizes you,

35:29.836 --> 35:31.588
but you can't change
what you did.

35:31.755 --> 35:34.634
I wouldn't change it if I could.

35:39.304 --> 35:41.898
Shirley,

35:42.057 --> 35:46.233
there can't be any closer bond
between two people than this.

35:48.897 --> 35:50.740
You're very beautiful.

35:50.899 --> 35:53.322
You are.

35:53.485 --> 35:56.079
I would never say
such a thing casually.

35:56.237 --> 36:00.287
You're beautiful.

36:00.450 --> 36:03.203
And I want us
to do this together--

36:03.370 --> 36:06.123
this adventure.

36:06.289 --> 36:09.634
You changing.

36:09.793 --> 36:12.717
Becoming ever more beautiful.

36:12.879 --> 36:15.007
This is not a fanciful,

36:15.173 --> 36:18.768
whimsical thing-- it's a deep
and powerful desire.

36:18.927 --> 36:22.306
It will bring us
together, completely.

36:24.474 --> 36:26.351
And you have a start
on most women.

36:29.688 --> 36:33.363
In my heart, I see you
as a special beauty.

36:33.525 --> 36:36.950
Truly.

36:49.999 --> 36:51.876
Okay.
Yeah.

37:17.694 --> 37:18.946
- Okay.
- Okay?

37:19.112 --> 37:19.988
Mm-hmm.

37:22.782 --> 37:24.625
Good girl.

37:24.784 --> 37:26.252
That's very nice.

37:26.411 --> 37:28.459
I'll cool it.

37:28.621 --> 37:31.875
Very good.
There you go.

37:32.041 --> 37:33.884
Mm.

37:34.043 --> 37:35.886
You're beautiful.

37:36.045 --> 37:37.388
No more.

37:37.547 --> 37:38.719
No, just one more.

37:38.882 --> 37:40.384
I'm sleepy.
One more.

37:40.550 --> 37:42.723
Markus, please,
I've had enough.

37:48.183 --> 37:49.560
Okay, one more.

38:08.286 --> 38:10.630
<i>She killed a man.</i>

38:10.789 --> 38:13.713
Spent seven years
in prison for his murder.

38:13.875 --> 38:15.718
Read the thing.
Joint enterprise.

38:15.877 --> 38:18.130
She and her lover
killed a man.

38:18.296 --> 38:20.048
Who tried to kill her.

38:20.215 --> 38:21.717
She was harassed and abused
and threatened

38:21.883 --> 38:22.759
by this man.

38:22.926 --> 38:24.769
And you kept this from me.

38:24.928 --> 38:27.181
She has a new identity.

38:27.347 --> 38:29.896
She has a new life here.

38:30.058 --> 38:32.811
It is proper procedure, the new
identity, the... Dan, please. Please.

38:32.977 --> 38:35.446
You treated this woman's

38:35.605 --> 38:37.607
history as your personal secret.

38:37.774 --> 38:38.821
To protect her.

38:38.983 --> 38:39.950
To protect her?

38:40.109 --> 38:41.486
She's a convicted murderer.

38:41.653 --> 38:45.328
And you kept this fact
secret from me.

38:45.490 --> 38:47.709
From me...

38:47.867 --> 38:49.744
in order to protect her.

39:02.715 --> 39:05.594
Are you in
a relationship with her?

39:05.760 --> 39:07.228
No.

39:11.891 --> 39:13.859
Don't lie to me, Dan.

39:14.018 --> 39:15.895
I'm not lying to you, Hildur.

39:17.814 --> 39:21.489
I don't have any sort of
relationship with Elena.

39:21.651 --> 39:23.528
None at all.

39:26.322 --> 39:28.245
You know,
when I was in prison

39:28.408 --> 39:30.285
I met this man.

39:32.287 --> 39:34.130
A man who tried to help me.

39:34.289 --> 39:35.836
A psychiatrist.

39:35.999 --> 39:38.502
Um... He said to me that

39:38.668 --> 39:41.842
everyone is
made out of many...

39:42.005 --> 39:44.178
atomos... a-atoms?

39:44.340 --> 39:45.683
You understand?

39:45.842 --> 39:47.515
Atoms. Atoms, yes.
Atoms. Atoms.

39:47.677 --> 39:49.224
Atoms, yeah.

39:49.387 --> 39:51.105
So for a human being,

39:51.264 --> 39:52.607
it takes seven years

39:52.765 --> 39:54.733
before every atom,
one by one,

39:54.893 --> 39:57.442
is replaced with a new one.

39:57.604 --> 40:00.232
So that means
that after seven years,

40:00.398 --> 40:02.241
this person...

40:02.400 --> 40:04.277
is no longer that.

40:08.031 --> 40:09.578
So you're saying that Elena

40:09.741 --> 40:12.039
is a completely different
person than Esmerelda.

40:12.201 --> 40:14.078
That's what you mean.

40:16.497 --> 40:18.545
Everything is changed.

40:20.501 --> 40:23.004
That's how you console yourself.

40:23.171 --> 40:24.844
That you've changed,
that you're different.

40:25.006 --> 40:26.474
You're not that person anymore.
Somebody else did it.

40:26.633 --> 40:27.634
You didn't do it.

40:27.800 --> 40:29.643
I'm not her.

40:29.802 --> 40:32.271
Not anymore.

40:32.430 --> 40:34.649
But you did do it again.

40:34.807 --> 40:36.855
I mean, you found
another stooge--

40:37.018 --> 40:38.270
Frank Sutter--

40:38.436 --> 40:41.030
and you and Frank Sutter

40:41.189 --> 40:43.066
killed professor Stoddart.
No.

40:43.232 --> 40:44.825
No, I did none of this.

40:44.984 --> 40:46.861
You what?
I did none of this.

40:50.156 --> 40:52.033
Billy Pettigrew.

40:59.082 --> 41:00.925
When I asked you, the other day,

41:01.084 --> 41:02.506
if he had stayed at that hotel--

41:02.669 --> 41:04.091
the day I met you--

41:04.253 --> 41:06.972
you blushed like
you're doing right now.

41:07.131 --> 41:09.133
Billy Pettigrew.

41:09.300 --> 41:11.143
He was eaten by a polar bear.

41:11.302 --> 41:12.645
You knew him, though.

41:12.804 --> 41:15.432
Why is he
asking her this?

41:15.598 --> 41:18.442
I served him coffee
like I serve you coffee.

41:18.601 --> 41:20.649
Eugene Morton.

41:23.898 --> 41:26.447
See? If I say my name,
you don't blush.

41:29.904 --> 41:32.999
Why the fuck is he asking her
about Billy Pettigrew now?

41:34.659 --> 41:36.536
Because...

41:37.954 --> 41:39.831
Pettigrew's
the reason he's here.

41:46.838 --> 41:49.341
It matches?
Blood on the T-shirt

41:49.507 --> 41:50.850
is Charlie
Stoddart's blood.

41:51.009 --> 41:52.852
That's beyond doubt.

41:53.011 --> 41:54.558
Beyond doubt?

41:54.721 --> 41:57.565
The DNA is the same,
so that's Charlie's blood.

41:57.724 --> 42:00.694
Right. But how it got
there or who killed him

42:00.852 --> 42:03.776
is absolutely separate. All we
can tell you is the simple fact.

42:03.938 --> 42:05.940
Nothing we've found can offer
any kind of explanation.

42:06.107 --> 42:07.984
Right. Thanks.

42:12.572 --> 42:15.041
It's him.

42:15.199 --> 42:16.325
<i>Frank killed him.</i>

42:16.492 --> 42:18.039
Why would he do that?

42:18.202 --> 42:20.625
Well, it must be
to do with Elena. - No.

42:20.788 --> 42:22.131
She's lying to protect him.

42:22.290 --> 42:23.837
They're one another's alibi.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.547
Nah, there's no motive.
There's no reason.

42:25.710 --> 42:27.462
We're still trying
to find a motive.

42:27.628 --> 42:29.471
She says
she was with Frank

42:29.630 --> 42:31.223
at the time of the murder.

42:31.382 --> 42:33.760
Now, we know it's Charlie
Stoddart's blood, yes?

42:33.926 --> 42:36.770
No. No. That proves he
murdered Charlie, theref...

42:36.929 --> 42:38.977
...therefore she's lying.
No, she's not lying.

42:39.140 --> 42:40.483
No?

42:40.641 --> 42:42.018
If that's not the case,

42:42.185 --> 42:43.437
what is the case, Sheriff?

42:43.603 --> 42:45.025
Do you know something
that we don't?

42:45.188 --> 42:46.314
Is there some kind
of explanation

42:46.481 --> 42:48.358
here that only
you can see?

42:48.524 --> 42:49.446
You know her criminal record.

42:49.609 --> 42:51.782
No, she didn't do this!

42:53.988 --> 42:55.331
You're besotted.

42:58.242 --> 42:59.619
They think you and Elena
murdered Stoddart.

42:59.786 --> 43:01.788
The blood they say was
Stoddart's was the blood

43:01.954 --> 43:04.924
They think you're infatuated with Elena.
I washed off my own son.

43:05.083 --> 43:06.926
Enough to kill a man over. Are you?
He was laying there, so...

43:07.085 --> 43:08.712
Are you, Frank?!
helpless, alone.

43:08.878 --> 43:09.879
My Son!

43:10.046 --> 43:11.673
Covered in blood.

43:14.675 --> 43:16.928
I thought he
was gonna die.

43:17.095 --> 43:20.099
That's what I thought, so I
panicked, I panicked badly.

43:20.264 --> 43:21.641
But I didn't do it.

43:21.808 --> 43:23.856
I didn't kill Stoddart.

43:25.353 --> 43:27.447
I know you didn't.

43:48.960 --> 43:51.054
The professor
told me this word.

43:51.212 --> 43:53.260
Icelandic word
for elation.

43:53.422 --> 43:54.719
What, <i>glethi</i> ?

43:54.882 --> 43:57.305
<i>Glethi</i>, that's it.

43:57.468 --> 43:59.721
Sort of what
I'm feeling now.

43:59.887 --> 44:02.811
You and me, we could have helped
catch the person who did this.

44:02.974 --> 44:04.851
Yeah.

44:06.435 --> 44:08.779
I want to get drunk
or something.

44:08.938 --> 44:12.317
Yeah, you should do that.

44:12.483 --> 44:14.360
I haven't got
any drink at mine.

44:16.487 --> 44:18.364
Well, I have.

44:19.782 --> 44:21.625
Come to mine.

44:21.784 --> 44:23.206
Okay.

44:25.663 --> 44:27.506
<i>What are you looking for?</i>

44:27.665 --> 44:30.760
I believe Frank.
I believe Frank and Elena.

44:32.628 --> 44:35.757
I need to prove they didn't
do this terrible thing.

44:35.923 --> 44:37.971
What was Liam wearing
when you left him?

44:38.134 --> 44:39.977
Um, just pajamas.

44:40.136 --> 44:41.809
Do you know where they are?

44:41.971 --> 44:44.315
No, I couldn't find them.
Think, Jules.

44:44.473 --> 44:45.440
I don't know.

44:45.600 --> 44:47.227
Under the bed?

44:47.393 --> 44:50.192
No, I-I would have
found them there.

44:50.354 --> 44:52.948
Ah... Dan, talk to
me, what's going on?

45:05.786 --> 45:08.039
<i>In the little boy's bedroom.</i>

45:08.206 --> 45:10.755
Covered in blood.

45:10.917 --> 45:13.466
<i>Caked</i> in dried blood.

45:13.628 --> 45:15.847
Frank was
telling the truth.

45:18.716 --> 45:20.639
The frostbite.

45:20.801 --> 45:22.678
Something terrible
happened to him.

45:22.845 --> 45:26.349
The little boy was there when
Charlie Stoddart was murdered.

45:27.850 --> 45:29.727
He was right there.

45:34.273 --> 45:35.274
Dan?

45:36.734 --> 45:39.328
The window was open.

45:39.487 --> 45:41.489
Liam's bedroom window.

45:41.656 --> 45:44.284
Someone took him.

46:13.479 --> 46:15.356
♪♪

47:50.368 --> 47:52.211
At first I thought it
was a bone fragment.

47:52.370 --> 47:53.542
It's a fingernail.
Someone

47:53.704 --> 47:54.705
must have put that there!

47:54.872 --> 47:55.794
That is not him!

47:55.956 --> 47:57.299
Don't touch me!

47:57.458 --> 47:59.085
My feet are burning!

47:59.251 --> 48:01.674
Pettigrew made the scan
that was in this folder.

48:01.837 --> 48:04.135
Now the scan is gone
and Pettigrew is dead.

48:04.298 --> 48:05.550
<i>Where would a shaman
lay his hands</i>

48:05.716 --> 48:07.218
on half a pint
of murderer's blood?

48:07.385 --> 48:08.432
<i>Beyond human understanding,</i>

48:08.594 --> 48:09.686
<i>but that is what happened.</i>

48:09.845 --> 48:12.439
No witness, no motive,

48:12.598 --> 48:14.396
no crime.

48:14.558 --> 48:16.276
<i>We have the murderer for sure.</i>

48:16.435 --> 48:17.857
I want to go home.

48:18.020 --> 48:19.317
I just came to say
one thing to you.

48:19.480 --> 48:22.859
Stay the fuck away from me.

48:25.500 --> 48:35.500
