I thought it was toe fingers.

00:08.140 --> 00:08.980
Whatcha want for lunch?

00:08.980 --> 00:11.310
I'm not sure. Hey, Festus.

00:11.810 --> 00:14.640
Hello, buddy.
Welcome to lunch.

00:15.180 --> 00:16.320
What you got today?

00:16.320 --> 00:16.750
Let's see.

00:16.750 --> 00:18.720
- I have the spaghetti...
- Oh.

00:18.720 --> 00:20.550
... The ravioli.
I love ravioli.

00:20.560 --> 00:22.250
You let me finish!

00:23.360 --> 00:25.610
Okay. Sorry.
Go ahead. Finish.

00:26.260 --> 00:28.920
That's all we got, the
spaghetti and the ravioli.

00:29.430 --> 00:31.730
- I'll have the ravioli.
- Me too.

00:31.730 --> 00:33.360
I will get your foods.

00:34.450 --> 00:35.960
Hi. What's for lunch?

00:35.980 --> 00:38.770
Oh. He's got the
spaghetti, the ravioli.

00:38.770 --> 00:41.050
- Ravioli?
- You let her finish!

00:42.480 --> 00:44.840
Oh, hey, I just wanted to remind you guys

00:44.850 --> 00:46.880
that I'm going away to
cancun with Beck's family

00:46.880 --> 00:49.690
for semester break, and you
guys have nothing fun to do.

00:53.460 --> 00:57.220
So you got nothing to
do for semester break?

00:57.230 --> 00:58.450
No.

00:58.890 --> 01:00.600
Come to the back of my truck.

01:04.800 --> 01:06.760
He wants you to go behind his truck.

01:08.070 --> 01:09.020
I know.

01:12.070 --> 01:13.970
- Hi-hi.
- Ravioli?

01:14.080 --> 01:16.220
Like pasta pillows.

01:21.180 --> 01:23.280
- You got a nice truck.
- Don't lie to me.

01:23.290 --> 01:24.650
I'm sorry.

01:24.650 --> 01:25.750
Listen.

01:25.750 --> 01:28.820
How would you and your
friends like to take a trip

01:28.820 --> 01:32.130
to my home country, Yerba?

01:32.130 --> 01:33.590
Yerba?

01:33.600 --> 01:36.030
It's very exotic island.

01:36.030 --> 01:37.020
Like Hawaii?

01:37.770 --> 01:39.500
Sure. Yeah, like that.

01:41.300 --> 01:45.320
My brother, he's in charge
of best hotel in Yerba.

01:45.610 --> 01:49.490
And my people, they love to see
american-style entertainment

01:50.010 --> 01:53.290
with the singing, the dancing.

01:54.820 --> 01:58.890
So if you and your friends will
sing and dance at the hotel,

01:59.140 --> 02:02.980
my brother will make your
whole trip for free.

02:03.660 --> 02:05.390
That sounds amazing.

02:05.390 --> 02:08.360
So you take down my brother's
phone number in Yerba.

02:08.360 --> 02:09.430
Okay.

02:09.430 --> 02:10.750
You reach him by dialing...

02:10.750 --> 02:12.310
- 05...
- 05...

02:12.340 --> 02:14.930

03:34.330 --> 03:37.270
So I called his brother as soon
as I got home, and it's true.

03:37.270 --> 03:40.340
They'll pay for our plane fares,
our hotel rooms, our food.

03:40.340 --> 03:42.640
And all we have to do is
one performance a night.

03:42.640 --> 03:44.210
That sounds so fun.

03:44.210 --> 03:46.110
- And this island, uh...
- Yerba.

03:46.110 --> 03:47.440
Yerba, it's a cool place?

03:47.440 --> 03:50.110
Yeah. Festus said it's
kind of like Hawaii.

03:50.110 --> 03:55.380
Oh, and I went to the official
Yerba website and look.

03:55.390 --> 03:57.390
- Oh. Look at that!
- Oh, white sand beach.

03:57.390 --> 03:58.770
Computer.

03:59.790 --> 04:02.390
Okay.
So if your parents say it's cool,

04:02.390 --> 04:03.290
do you guys wanna do it?

04:03.290 --> 04:04.360
- Sure.
- Absolutely.

04:04.390 --> 04:05.260
Awesome.

04:05.260 --> 04:07.330
Here, check out some
more pics of the resort.

04:07.330 --> 04:08.090
All right, cool.

04:10.130 --> 04:12.270
I'm never playing mini
golf with you guys again.

04:12.270 --> 04:13.150
Promise?

04:13.950 --> 04:14.970
What happened?

04:14.970 --> 04:19.670
Trina missed a putt, so she got upset
and threw a golf club at her father.

04:20.209 --> 04:25.550
No. I threw my golf club, and dad
just stood there and let it hit him.

04:25.550 --> 04:29.080
Well, that was fun.

04:31.420 --> 04:34.330
Aw, honey, it's throbbing.

04:35.760 --> 04:36.960
Trina, get an ice pack.

04:36.960 --> 04:39.030
No.
I have to go paint my nails.

04:39.030 --> 04:47.000
- But...
- Aw, it is throbbing.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.140
Yes. Yes. Thank you, baby.

04:51.140 --> 04:52.140
Oh.

04:52.140 --> 04:54.080
Oh. Hey, did you talk to
your friends about Yerba?

04:54.080 --> 04:55.610
Yeah.
I think we're all going.

04:55.610 --> 04:57.180
Good. You're taking trina.

04:57.180 --> 04:58.010
- No.
- Yes.

04:58.020 --> 05:00.480
- You are taking trina.
- Not happening.

05:00.480 --> 05:03.140
- We'll buy you a car.
- Any car you want.

05:04.220 --> 05:05.870
You don't even have to bring her back.

05:07.320 --> 05:11.360
My mom says Rex and I can go to Yerba,
but there has to be an adult chaperone.

05:11.360 --> 05:12.730
I thought your mom moved out.

05:12.730 --> 05:17.030
She's giving me one more chance.

05:17.030 --> 05:19.630
Of course, you have to
have an adult chaperone.

05:19.640 --> 05:22.340
- Why? I'm 16.
- Adult chaperone or no trip.

05:22.340 --> 05:22.800
Dad.

05:22.810 --> 05:27.240
Please don't argue with me
while my nose is throbbing.

05:27.240 --> 05:30.420
Could I feel your throbbing nose?

05:31.850 --> 05:33.370
- Walk away.
- Yes, sir.

05:37.450 --> 05:38.490
Yerba?

05:38.490 --> 05:40.890
Yeah, it's a small island
just off the coast of...

05:40.890 --> 05:42.390
Oh, I know where it is.

05:42.390 --> 05:45.290
I spent 2 weeks in Yerba when I was 23.

05:45.300 --> 05:47.070
Cool. So what's it like?

05:48.170 --> 05:49.830
I remember nothing of that trip.

05:51.370 --> 05:53.700
Well, do you wanna be our chaperone?

05:53.840 --> 05:54.910
To what?

05:55.270 --> 05:57.210
Our trip to Yerba.

05:57.210 --> 05:58.540
Yerba?

05:58.540 --> 06:01.580
I spent 2 weeks there when I was 23.

06:01.580 --> 06:04.580
- Will you just be our chaperone?
- Of course.

06:04.580 --> 06:05.890
Yay!

06:07.280 --> 06:09.080
So who all's coming?

06:09.090 --> 06:11.660
- Okay. It's gonna beme, Andre, c... 
- No.

06:11.790 --> 06:12.340
- Cat...
- No.

06:12.380 --> 06:13.820
- Come on.
- No. I don't wanna ask her.

06:13.820 --> 06:15.360
- No.
- Come on. Come on.

06:15.360 --> 06:16.230
No.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.330
We'll both ask her.

06:19.130 --> 06:19.930
What's going on?

06:20.630 --> 06:22.500
My aunt says we can't go to cancun.

06:22.500 --> 06:24.700
Aw, how come?

06:24.700 --> 06:26.610
She found out I was bringing Jade.

06:27.010 --> 06:27.820
Ha.

06:28.410 --> 06:30.680
So we hear some of you
guys are going to Yerba?

06:31.810 --> 06:34.170
Yes. Yes, we are.

06:34.710 --> 06:36.840
Would you like to come
to Yerba with us, Beck?

06:37.010 --> 06:38.730
Oh, that'd be great. Thanks.

06:38.730 --> 06:38.750
- Hmm.
- Oh, that'd be great. Thanks.

06:38.750 --> 06:39.370
Hmm.

06:42.850 --> 06:46.660
Jade, do you have a question for me?

06:49.460 --> 06:50.700
Can I come to Yerba?

06:52.390 --> 06:54.720
Hmm, maybe.

06:55.500 --> 07:00.300
But first, you gotta gimme a hug.

07:01.570 --> 07:02.240
- Come on.
- No.

07:02.240 --> 07:03.170
- Come on.
- I don't want to.

07:03.170 --> 07:03.650
- Come on.
- No.

07:03.670 --> 07:04.430
Just do it.

07:06.080 --> 07:08.140
Aw, see?

07:08.150 --> 07:12.050
Givin' Tori a big old hug
isn't such a bad thing... okay.

07:12.050 --> 07:13.480
That's really tight.

07:13.480 --> 07:14.920
Oh, God. Help me.

07:14.920 --> 07:16.870
Aah! Somebody, help us up.

Feeling: Sore!

07:36.070 --> 07:38.300
So I was dialing one of
those things where...

07:46.050 --> 07:47.980
This dump is our hotel?

07:49.290 --> 07:50.050
Yeah.

07:50.810 --> 07:51.920
Gross.

07:52.360 --> 07:55.240
Now I'm kinda glad I
don't remember this place.

07:56.990 --> 08:00.660
Hello. Hello to you, buddies.

08:01.400 --> 08:03.710
Which is Tori Vega?

08:03.920 --> 08:05.430
Oh. That's me.

08:06.020 --> 08:07.700
Are you Festus' brother?

08:07.700 --> 08:10.570
Yes, buddy. I am Sgrodis.

08:10.600 --> 08:12.640
It's happy to meet you.

08:17.780 --> 08:18.860
Why?

08:20.370 --> 08:22.280
It's a Yerbanian custom.

08:22.290 --> 08:23.080
See?

08:23.090 --> 08:25.690
It says, "in Yerba, "when
people greet each other,

08:25.690 --> 08:27.590
"they will often sniff "each other's hands

08:27.590 --> 08:29.510
as a sign of friendship."

08:31.260 --> 08:32.630
Oh.

08:33.799 --> 08:35.820
Oh, that's okay.

08:36.340 --> 08:39.330
So how you all like the hotel?

08:40.270 --> 08:44.680
- Well, um, uh...
- It's disgusting.

08:46.410 --> 08:47.530
She said what?

08:48.050 --> 08:52.410
Uh, this hotel, it doesn't really look like

08:52.420 --> 08:54.580
the picture we saw online.

08:54.580 --> 08:57.350
Oh, the picture.

08:57.350 --> 08:59.590
Yes, there she is.

09:04.460 --> 09:06.630
It is beautiful, isn't it?

09:06.630 --> 09:08.610
So where's that hotel?

09:11.200 --> 09:13.210
I don't know. Maybe cancun?

09:16.680 --> 09:19.590
I will go get someone to
help you with your bags.

09:24.350 --> 09:26.470
I don't like this place at all.

09:28.620 --> 09:30.520
Festus said this hotel was nice?

09:30.520 --> 09:31.890
Yes.

09:31.890 --> 09:33.120
Okay, this isn't my fault.

09:33.120 --> 09:34.220
Yeah, it is.

09:34.220 --> 09:37.630
- How was I supposed to know?
- Hey, buddies, this is Kreploch.

09:37.630 --> 09:39.610
He will take your luggages.

09:40.660 --> 09:41.830

- Well...
- Here are the keys to your rooms.

10:33.460 --> 10:35.060
Those are screwdrivers.

10:35.490 --> 10:36.390
I know.

10:37.890 --> 10:40.350
He said to stick it in the
keyhole and jiggle it.

10:41.910 --> 10:44.180
What did he say about
the indoor swimming pool?

10:45.670 --> 10:50.690
Well, um, apparently, this
country is sort of "at war,"

10:52.290 --> 10:55.810
so the swimming pool here is
currently filled with ammunition.

10:56.920 --> 10:58.950
And where's the white sand beach?

10:58.950 --> 11:00.530
Yeah, where's the beach?

11:01.650 --> 11:05.290
It's, uh, it's been taken over by rebels.

11:07.300 --> 11:08.050
Okay.

11:08.560 --> 11:11.390
So before you booked our trip
here, you forgot to find out

11:11.400 --> 11:13.880
that this is the worst country on earth?

11:15.370 --> 11:16.000
Yeah.

11:17.170 --> 11:20.200
Jade, don't be such a crabby cathy.

11:20.200 --> 11:21.770
I have every right to be a crabby cathy...

11:22.810 --> 11:24.340
All right, if you
could stop it... that's...

11:24.340 --> 11:25.740
Okay, I got it, custom.

11:25.760 --> 11:29.190
Ah, crabby cathy is about
to get a little bit crabbier.

11:33.020 --> 11:36.350
I think those girls like
Beck's Fluffy American hair.

11:36.920 --> 11:37.970
Clearly.

Hey! Get your hands off

looked at our rooms,

11:54.970 --> 11:56.770
and there's no way I'm staying here.

11:56.770 --> 11:57.710
Me neither.

11:57.710 --> 11:59.470
What's so bad about your rooms?

11:59.480 --> 12:03.340
Well, we can start with the
foreign man I found in my closet.

12:03.350 --> 12:05.560
And there was a grenade in my toilet.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.960
There's nicer hotels in northridge.

12:09.220 --> 12:10.690
Aah! Aah!

12:10.690 --> 12:11.550
What happened?

12:11.560 --> 12:12.690
Somethin' bit my neck!

12:12.690 --> 12:14.190
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it looked like a moth.

12:14.190 --> 12:15.120
- Are you...
- A moth?

12:15.130 --> 12:16.680
- Moth.
- What happened?

12:16.780 --> 12:18.960
A moth bit our friend's neck.

12:18.960 --> 12:19.830
A moth?

12:19.830 --> 12:22.630
Was it about this big and
black like the night?

12:23.890 --> 12:24.800
Yeah.

12:24.800 --> 12:27.220
Ah, that was a vampire moth.

12:28.270 --> 12:30.110
Well, is he gonna be okay?

12:30.450 --> 12:31.440
Of course.

12:31.440 --> 12:34.580
Being bitten by a vampire
moth is very good luck.

12:35.060 --> 12:35.910
Hah.

12:35.910 --> 12:40.010
Wait, but it says here that a bite
from a vampire moth could kill you.

12:40.020 --> 12:44.320
Yes, but if you live, you are very lucky.

13:06.810 --> 13:08.880
How can she sleep in the middle of a war?

13:10.060 --> 13:11.870
I don't like this hotel.

13:12.330 --> 13:14.510
Oh, come on, guys.

13:14.990 --> 13:16.860
They're just bombs.

13:17.380 --> 13:19.320
You know, I'm sure that...

13:27.550 --> 13:28.750
Dude.

13:28.930 --> 13:30.300
Robbie.

13:30.300 --> 13:31.300
Hi.

13:32.070 --> 13:33.300
Get out of our room.

13:33.300 --> 13:35.200
No, I'm afraid to sleep alone.

13:35.210 --> 13:36.810
What about Andre and Beck?

13:36.810 --> 13:40.640
They made me sleep in the bathtub,
and I saw a lizard in there.

13:40.640 --> 13:42.320
- A lizard?
- Oh my God.

13:42.460 --> 13:44.060
You guys are such babies.

13:44.070 --> 13:46.820
Just because this place isn't
quite as cushy as America,

13:46.820 --> 13:48.420
you make it seem like
we're in the middle of...

13:51.190 --> 13:53.650
Hide me, hide me!

13:57.290 --> 14:00.780
Let go, let go, let go!

14:12.420 --> 14:14.280
We are getting out of this country.

14:14.290 --> 14:15.780
Yeah!

14:27.420 --> 14:28.230
Hey.

14:28.910 --> 14:32.500
Hello, buddies.
Who wants mushroom?

14:32.730 --> 14:34.010
No one!

14:34.170 --> 14:36.460
- I love mushrooms.
- Cat!

14:36.470 --> 14:37.780
I hate mushrooms?

14:39.270 --> 14:39.970
We are leaving this...

14:45.250 --> 14:47.510
We are leaving this country.

14:47.510 --> 14:50.940
- Right now.
- Oh, buddies.

14:51.630 --> 14:53.310
There they are.

14:53.320 --> 14:57.320
Okay, what's all the fissy fuss?

14:57.320 --> 15:01.510
We wanna go... oh my
God, look at Andre!

15:03.460 --> 15:05.260
What's on his neck?

15:05.260 --> 15:07.580
It's from his moth bite.
It won't stop growing.

15:07.670 --> 15:12.150
- Umm. No, no. Ooohh-eee-aaahh.

15:12.740 --> 15:17.340
- Oh, what's he saying?
- I think it was ooohh-eee-aaahh.

15:17.340 --> 15:19.710
- Uh-huh.
- Here.

15:19.710 --> 15:21.140
It says, "a person who has been bitten

15:21.140 --> 15:23.950
"by a vampire moth will often
"experience hallucinations

15:23.950 --> 15:26.250
or bizarre speech patterns."

15:26.250 --> 15:28.820
- Ooohh-eee-aaahh.

15:30.560 --> 15:31.710
Okay.

15:31.710 --> 15:34.720
I just woke up and found
this sitting on my chest.

15:34.720 --> 15:36.260
Ewww.

15:36.260 --> 15:38.800
- A dead lizard?
- It's dead now.

15:41.800 --> 15:44.600
Whoa, Andre, who's your friend?

15:46.900 --> 15:49.400
Give us our plane tickets home right now!

15:49.410 --> 15:51.110
Why you want to leave Yerba?

15:51.110 --> 15:54.270
- We hate it here.
- Our friend is hallucinating!

15:55.250 --> 15:57.310
An escaped prisoner
crashed through our window

15:57.310 --> 15:59.760
and was dragged out by yerbanian soldiers!

16:00.600 --> 16:02.490
And our bed is lumpy.

16:03.350 --> 16:06.990
Okay.
I'm very sorry about the troubles.

16:06.990 --> 16:08.490
Here.

16:09.690 --> 16:15.240
Everyone, please enjoy a
free can of yerbanian gravy.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.940
Yerbanian gravy?

16:19.770 --> 16:21.620
Made in prison?

16:23.010 --> 16:25.910
We don't want to eat your prison gravy.

16:27.040 --> 16:28.580
We wanna go home!

16:28.580 --> 16:29.820
Wait.

16:30.780 --> 16:33.060
Shouldn't we at least try the gravy?

16:35.220 --> 16:37.350
We are leaving this country now!

16:37.350 --> 16:41.960
You kids promised to make
singso here for seven nights.

16:41.960 --> 16:47.650
Well, I'm afraid that's a promise
they're going to have to break.

16:49.960 --> 16:51.800
Are they?

17:03.040 --> 17:07.470
So what song should we do tomorrow night?

17:21.319 --> 17:26.810
Hey, you know what,
yerbanian gravy, not so bad.

17:32.780 --> 17:35.940
Let's wat the sun come up.

17:35.950 --> 17:39.750
Nyaaaaaa!

17:40.340 --> 17:43.950
You're really gonna let your screech
box of a sister sing with us?

17:44.450 --> 17:46.850
The guys are gonna keep her mic turned off.

17:46.860 --> 17:49.220
Oh, that's swell news.

17:49.230 --> 17:51.240
I don't talk like that.

17:51.430 --> 17:54.170
- Whatever.
- Don't talk like that.

17:54.630 --> 17:57.250
Do I talk like that?
No, I don't talk like that.

17:59.070 --> 18:02.270
- Hey. Hey, Sikowitz.
- Hey, Vega.

18:03.260 --> 18:05.670
How are we gonna do this
performance if Andre's sick?

18:05.680 --> 18:06.670
Relax.

18:06.680 --> 18:13.180
He's with a yerbanian doctor
right behind that stained sheet.

18:13.180 --> 18:15.390
Come, let's check on him.

18:21.690 --> 18:27.960
Hello. I don't like that.

18:29.030 --> 18:31.130
Okay, where is the doctor?

18:31.130 --> 18:34.450
That's him there.

18:36.310 --> 18:40.560
- What... the boy? He's like 11.
- Almost 12.

18:41.680 --> 18:43.880
- How is he, doc?
- Eh.

18:45.320 --> 18:48.080
That boy is not a doctor.

18:48.080 --> 18:52.990
No, but he is the doctor's son.

18:54.960 --> 18:56.690
Where is the doctor?

18:56.690 --> 18:59.730
His boy is the best we could find.

18:59.730 --> 19:02.460
Is Andre going to be okay?

19:02.470 --> 19:05.100
Maybe. I gave him shot.

19:06.680 --> 19:08.720
Now I give him lu-lu pop.

19:12.610 --> 19:15.670
- Vetch-goof oz.
- Vetch-goof oz.

19:18.450 --> 19:19.780
Andre?

19:19.780 --> 19:22.000
You think you can perform tonight?

19:22.890 --> 19:26.510
Yeah. I think so.

19:27.300 --> 19:30.380
I had a dream that a little
foreign boy gave me a shot.

19:31.660 --> 19:34.060
- Yeah, well...
- Tori. Tori. Tori.

19:34.060 --> 19:35.600
- Tori. Tori.
- Guess what.

19:35.600 --> 19:38.400
The chancellor of Yerba is
coming to see us perform tonight.

19:38.400 --> 19:41.200
- Good Gandhi!
- Who is the chancellor of Yerba?

19:41.200 --> 19:42.460
Yes, who is that?

19:43.970 --> 19:47.880
Our chancellor... he
like your president.

19:47.880 --> 19:51.710
And look, he only has one eye.

19:52.980 --> 19:54.680
What happened to his other eye?

19:54.680 --> 19:58.020
It stopped working after he
was bitten by vampire moth.

19:58.020 --> 19:59.230
What?

20:00.360 --> 20:03.610
Nothing, buddy.
Forget about that.

20:04.330 --> 20:06.100
Eat your lu-lu pop.

20:11.170 --> 20:12.400
Good evening.

20:12.400 --> 20:15.550
We're from Hollywood arts
High School in America.

20:21.280 --> 20:27.490
We'd like to welcome a most special guest,
the chancellor of this fine country.

20:33.290 --> 20:34.640
Don't do that.

20:36.260 --> 20:39.090
And now we present Trina Vega.

20:39.100 --> 20:40.830
- Andre Harris.
- Jade West.

20:40.830 --> 20:43.700
- Cat Valentine.
- And Tori Vega.

20:43.700 --> 20:45.660
Whoo.

- In his last good eye.

22:47.820 --> 22:50.160
I'm so sorry.
My shoe justlelew off and...

22:53.930 --> 22:57.300
- what are they doing?
- Let her go.

22:57.300 --> 22:58.630

- Wait.

22:58.630 --> 23:01.740

- To the prison.

23:01.740 --> 23:03.170
Prison?

23:05.140 --> 23:08.340
I got away. I got away.

Tori Vega, you stand accused of assaulting

24:33.920 --> 24:36.220
our esteemed chancellor of Yerba.

24:36.220 --> 24:39.840
This trial will determine if you
are innocent or...

24:39.840 --> 24:41.160
Guilty!

24:43.360 --> 24:44.830
- Which way?
- Over there.

24:44.830 --> 24:46.090
- This way?
- To the right.

24:46.100 --> 24:47.060
- Right there?
- This way.

24:47.060 --> 24:49.870
Okay. Guilty!

24:50.730 --> 24:53.130
- Wait.
- Now wait a minute.

24:53.140 --> 24:56.460
This girl is entitled to legal counsel.

24:57.970 --> 25:00.700
- Very well.
- Ik-boosh-veen!

25:04.110 --> 25:08.540
- This is my lawyer?
- Yes! Yorvis.

25:08.790 --> 25:11.020
Eh.

25:11.020 --> 25:14.190
The chancellor of Yerba
has deemed that that female

25:14.190 --> 25:18.090
guilty of assault upon his eyeball.

25:18.090 --> 25:21.680
Do you think the chancellor is wrong?

25:24.750 --> 25:30.380
No. No, no, no.
She is guilty. Guilty.

25:37.810 --> 25:39.830
Can I have a different lawyer?

25:41.320 --> 25:44.490
Admit you did this to me on porpoise.

25:44.490 --> 25:47.130
No, it was just a shoe malfunction.

25:48.220 --> 25:53.560
Admit you did this on porpoise, and
your punishment will be not as bad.

25:53.560 --> 25:56.530
But I didn't do it on porpoise.

25:57.700 --> 26:00.770
Your shoe entered my eye!

26:01.470 --> 26:04.140
- I know, but...
- You are guilty!

26:04.140 --> 26:06.970
Guilty as charged!

26:06.980 --> 26:09.340
Four years in yerbanian prison.

26:09.350 --> 26:11.250
- Four years?
- Come on.

26:11.250 --> 26:14.860
- This isn't fair.
- My lawyer crawled away.

26:16.140 --> 26:17.860
Remove her!

26:19.090 --> 26:20.490
- Wait a minute!
- Wait!

26:20.490 --> 26:23.290
It was just a shoe malfunction!

26:23.290 --> 26:25.590
- This is ridiculous.
- Oh my God.

26:25.860 --> 26:29.430
- I've got to get a soda.
- A soda?

26:43.080 --> 26:47.080
Uhhh. Go fish.

26:52.260 --> 26:55.300
Okay, that is not how we
play go fish in America.

26:55.760 --> 26:57.130
Careful.

26:57.130 --> 26:59.890
She's the one who stabbed
the chancellor's eyeball.

27:01.560 --> 27:04.660
- Uhhh, I am so sorry.
- Sorry.

27:06.000 --> 27:11.250
- Yeah, run faster.
Uh-huh. Owwwie.

27:12.980 --> 27:15.440
Pssst. Tori.

27:15.450 --> 27:19.000
- Tori.
- Oh my God. You guys.

27:19.450 --> 27:21.350
- Hey, Tori.
- Awww.

27:21.350 --> 27:22.980
You've looked better.

27:24.150 --> 27:26.950
- Where's Sikowitz?
- He's with Beck and Robbie.

27:26.960 --> 27:28.420
They're on the phone calling mom and dad,

27:28.420 --> 27:30.490
our American ambassador, some lawyers.

27:30.490 --> 27:34.730
Well, why wouldn't they call...
Andre, what are you eating?

27:34.730 --> 27:35.740
Salt.

27:36.730 --> 27:39.100
- Why would you...
- One of the signs

27:39.100 --> 27:42.470
of getting over the moth poison
is an extreme craving for salt.

27:42.470 --> 27:44.890
I hate the taste, but I can't stop.

27:47.010 --> 27:49.040
So, has anyone tried to beat you up?

27:49.050 --> 27:50.380
No.

27:50.380 --> 27:52.160
I've got some street cred in here.

27:53.200 --> 27:56.790
'Cause they think I'm the psycho girl who stabbed
the chancellor in his eye.

27:57.450 --> 27:59.000
You are.

28:01.690 --> 28:02.890
Wait.

28:02.980 --> 28:04.700
Are those dudes over there?

28:05.460 --> 28:06.790
- Uh-huh.

28:06.800 --> 28:09.530
Oh my God, this prison
is for women and men?

28:09.530 --> 28:12.640
Yeah, but there's a big fence
separating the guys from the girls.

28:13.900 --> 28:14.470
Right.

28:14.470 --> 28:17.210
So you're tellin' me that
freak show is a girl?

28:17.210 --> 28:19.440
What are you looking at?

28:20.680 --> 28:23.580
I'm lookin' at a big stupid lady in prison.

28:23.580 --> 28:24.960
What are you looking at?

28:25.850 --> 28:29.680
Oh, me make big man-lady mad.

28:29.690 --> 28:31.870
Oh, good one.

28:32.390 --> 28:35.830
Hey, call me. We'll go skirt shopping.

28:38.130 --> 28:40.330
Must you aggravate my fellow prisoners?

28:40.330 --> 28:41.520
Yes, I must.

28:42.930 --> 28:44.990
Man, eating salt is gross.

28:46.000 --> 28:49.070
Not as gross as the prison
food they make us eat in here.

28:49.550 --> 28:51.770
One time, when my brother was in prison,

28:51.770 --> 28:54.110
he told the people in charge
that he was a vegetarian,

28:54.110 --> 28:56.350
so they gave him special meals.

28:57.260 --> 28:59.300
Oh, wait, that was on an airplane.

29:00.520 --> 29:02.780
Will you guys just
please get me out of here?

29:02.790 --> 29:03.890
We're trying.

29:03.890 --> 29:06.890
Everybody's doin' everything they can.

29:07.620 --> 29:09.850
Hey, Vega.

29:10.890 --> 29:12.370
You wanna play rocks?

29:13.580 --> 29:15.840
Yeah, sure.

29:16.900 --> 29:19.740
- How do you play rocks?
- I don't know.

29:21.720 --> 29:23.240
Oh.

29:43.190 --> 29:46.590
Chancellor, the American entertainers
are here to see you, buddy.

29:47.430 --> 29:48.570
Bring them.

29:48.870 --> 29:51.020
- Mish-kobba!

29:56.540 --> 29:58.330
Hi.

30:00.840 --> 30:07.780
Chancellor, we're here to beseech you to
let Tori Vega out of your filthy prison.

30:08.080 --> 30:10.570
- No.
- Well, we tried.

30:11.520 --> 30:14.560
Sir, hi, I'm Tori's sister.

30:14.560 --> 30:18.890
And I can promise you she is a good girl.

30:18.900 --> 30:20.800
I mean, is she a perfect sister?

30:20.800 --> 30:21.660
No.

30:21.660 --> 30:24.230
Is she the prettiest or most
talented girl in the world?

30:24.230 --> 30:25.630
Not by a long shot.

30:26.260 --> 30:29.430
- Is she...
- How is this helping anything?

30:30.310 --> 30:36.380
Look, Tori didn't mean to kick her
shoe off and have it enter your eye.

30:36.380 --> 30:38.120
It was an accident.

30:38.400 --> 30:41.250
Hey, is that a squid in your fish tank?

30:41.250 --> 30:44.310
Squid? What squid?

30:45.190 --> 30:47.660
He is admiring your okkatapus.

30:47.660 --> 30:50.320
Oh, this is an octopus.

30:50.330 --> 30:54.330
It was given to the chancellor
by the prince of gooshtavia.

30:54.330 --> 30:55.500
Ahh.

30:55.500 --> 30:58.470
When I was 19, I spent a
whole month in gooshtavia.

30:58.470 --> 31:01.000
- It is beautiful country.
- Is it?

31:01.000 --> 31:03.660
'Cause I don't remember
one minute of that trip.

31:05.310 --> 31:07.580
Hey, come on now.
Can we all get back to Tori?

31:07.580 --> 31:08.910
Please let Tori go.

31:08.910 --> 31:11.180
We promise you, we'll take her and leave.

31:13.980 --> 31:17.850
Very well.
I will free Tori Vega.

31:19.390 --> 31:23.620
But you must promise to never
return to my country ever again.

31:23.630 --> 31:24.660
- It's okay.
- No big deal.

31:24.660 --> 31:25.730
- No arguments here.
- That's cool.

31:25.730 --> 31:27.060
I'll sign something.

31:35.540 --> 31:37.680
Way to go, urkel.

31:38.170 --> 31:40.310
What? What's happening?
What's going on?

31:40.310 --> 31:41.650
Nothing.

31:43.890 --> 31:51.150
- Chancellor, your, your okkatapus...
- Tell me fast!

31:53.960 --> 31:56.120
She is dead, buddy.

31:59.890 --> 32:01.560
Bring her to me.

32:24.790 --> 32:28.420
So should we go get Tori, or
is there like a shuttle bus

32:28.430 --> 32:33.320
that'll bring her...
- Aga-yoon-virma-quaz!

32:44.620 --> 32:48.880
No. I don't wanna... I don't wanna go. Oh, my God.

32:57.920 --> 33:00.140
You murdered the man's octopus?

33:25.210 --> 33:25.910
Beck.

33:27.260 --> 33:28.030
Yeah.

33:29.870 --> 33:31.180
I'm kinda scared.

33:33.810 --> 33:36.110
We'll be okay.

33:36.340 --> 33:38.030
Yeah, but what if we don't get outta here?

33:38.040 --> 33:42.520
How are we supposed to... what
are those guys about to do?

33:43.780 --> 33:46.030
I think they're gonna throw rocks at us.

33:50.620 --> 33:51.150
Hey!

33:51.150 --> 33:53.510
We told y'all we didn't wanna play rocks.

33:56.180 --> 33:58.790
Excuse me, sir? Office sir?

33:58.790 --> 34:00.020
What you want?

34:00.030 --> 34:02.660
Why have I been put on t the
girls' side of this prison?

34:02.660 --> 34:04.470
I'm clearly a boy.

34:07.150 --> 34:08.940
Prove it.

34:11.179 --> 34:13.600
I'll stay on the girls' side.

34:15.880 --> 34:18.300
I will stay on the girls' side.

34:18.639 --> 34:22.030
Large, scary lady coming.
Large, scary lady coming.

34:22.360 --> 34:23.380
Great.

34:23.380 --> 34:25.550
It's the one you called big
and stupid the other day.

34:25.550 --> 34:27.409
Whatever.
I'm not scared of this chick.

34:29.480 --> 34:33.420
So do I still look big and stupid?

34:33.670 --> 34:34.469
All right.

34:34.560 --> 34:36.120
Listen, hot stuff.

34:36.699 --> 34:39.500
You better just turn yourself
around and walk away from me

34:39.500 --> 34:41.940
'cause I'm gonna...

34:43.940 --> 34:46.040
I like it on the ground.

34:49.040 --> 34:52.409
- Tori, Tori.
- Hey, hey. Hey, hey. Hey.

34:52.409 --> 34:53.460
F'zock m'tog.

34:54.190 --> 34:55.699
- Ah-bocka-vool.

34:56.389 --> 34:57.860
She's my friend.

34:58.680 --> 35:01.240
Yeah. We're super close.

35:04.750 --> 35:08.620
You are lucky, American.

35:16.260 --> 35:19.490
- I didn't need your help.
- She would've eaten you.

35:21.370 --> 35:23.440
She wouldn't have liked it.

35:23.440 --> 35:27.230
Hi. Ew.
Jade, your outfit's all dirty.

35:27.570 --> 35:30.690
Oh, no. Now I'll never win
the prison beauty pageant.

35:31.550 --> 35:33.320
Wait. They have that?

35:34.890 --> 35:38.300
- Where've you been?
- I joined a prison gang.

35:39.830 --> 35:40.990
What do you mean?

35:40.990 --> 35:43.790
Well, this group of really
mean, tough prison ladies

35:43.800 --> 35:47.410
said I'm cute and funny, so they
invited me to join their prison gang.

35:47.530 --> 35:49.710
- And you said, yes?
- Uh-huh.

35:49.780 --> 35:53.580
I told the gang ladies I'm gonna
make us all special t-shirts.

35:57.380 --> 36:00.700
You. You, people.

36:02.220 --> 36:03.520
What?

36:03.690 --> 36:05.950
Who misses their favorite teacher?

36:05.950 --> 36:08.050
- Sikowitz.
- Oh, my God.

36:08.050 --> 36:09.120
Shhh.

36:09.120 --> 36:11.590
You have to act like I'm a
yerbanian prison guard.

36:11.590 --> 36:12.090
Right.

36:12.090 --> 36:12.520
Yeah.

36:12.520 --> 36:15.660
Okay.

36:15.660 --> 36:17.230
Where did you get that outfit?

36:17.230 --> 36:20.360
They sell these at the hotel gift shop.

36:20.370 --> 36:23.470
How stupid is that?

36:23.470 --> 36:26.770
- Would you just get us outta this prison?
- I'm working on that.

36:26.770 --> 36:28.650
- You have a plan?
- Sort of.

36:29.670 --> 36:31.490
I've got a duck truck.

36:32.270 --> 36:34.540
- A duck truck?
- Yes.

36:34.550 --> 36:37.960
I met a farmer and offered him a
hundred svarkles to let me borrow it.

36:39.070 --> 36:41.610
I joined a prison gang.

36:42.250 --> 36:43.820
Oh, Cat.

36:43.820 --> 36:51.730
You are delightfully filled
with joy and stupidity.

36:51.730 --> 36:53.900
Why are they talking to that prison guard?

36:53.900 --> 36:56.140
- I don't know. Maybe they...
- Hey!

37:03.240 --> 37:05.620
We're gonna die.

37:06.410 --> 37:08.850
- Don't act scared.
- I'm not acting.

37:09.340 --> 37:11.930
- You.
- Me?

37:17.540 --> 37:20.800
How you make your hair so fluffy?

37:23.330 --> 37:25.260
- Tell us!
- Tell 'em, man.

37:25.260 --> 37:27.270
Just tell them what they wanna know.

37:29.440 --> 37:30.830
Okay.

37:30.840 --> 37:35.000
Well, it all starts with a
quality shampoo and conditioner.

37:35.010 --> 37:38.330
- Oh, conditioner.
- Shampoo.

37:38.580 --> 37:41.380
So I'll have the truck tomorrow night.

37:41.380 --> 37:44.710
Now, there's an access road
right behind this building.

37:44.720 --> 37:47.550
I'll be there waiting
after dark in the truck.

37:47.550 --> 37:49.550
When you kids jump in the back,
I'll drive us across the border

37:49.550 --> 37:53.920
and right out of this
poop shack of a country.

37:53.930 --> 37:55.690
But how do we get out of this prison?

37:55.690 --> 37:56.160
Oh, come on.

37:56.160 --> 37:58.940
I'm supposed to think of everything?
I got the duck truck.

37:59.940 --> 38:03.500
Look, it's my prison gang friends.

38:03.500 --> 38:06.110
Wait up, girls.

38:06.940 --> 38:10.510
I'll be waiting in the duck truck
behind there tomorrow night after dark.

38:10.510 --> 38:11.610
- See you!
- Wait!

38:11.610 --> 38:14.310
- Sikowitz, wait!
- Bring Rex. Oh, he left us.

38:14.310 --> 38:17.070
How are we supposed to
break out of this prison?

38:19.330 --> 38:20.710
Hey. Hey, what's Cat doing?

38:20.770 --> 38:26.560
Hips, hips, wiggle your fists.
Hips, hips, wiggle your fists.

38:26.560 --> 38:32.600
Heeps, heeps, wiggle our feests.
Heeps, heeps, wiggle our feests.

38:32.600 --> 38:34.360
There you go.
You're getting it.

38:34.370 --> 38:37.930
Heeps, heeps wiggle our feests.

38:38.220 --> 38:40.800
I think I know how we can
break out of this place.

38:40.820 --> 38:42.100
How?

38:42.540 --> 38:44.130
Be right back.

38:45.410 --> 38:46.310
Hey, Sheema.

38:46.310 --> 38:50.110
- F'goosh.
- All these prisoners, they listen to you, right?

38:50.120 --> 38:51.210
G'noov.

38:51.580 --> 38:53.230
You wanna get out of here?

38:56.730 --> 38:59.590
- Hey, hey.
- What, buddy?

38:59.840 --> 39:03.290
I wanna see the chancellor.
I am ready to confess the truth.

39:03.690 --> 39:06.760
Very well.
We will take you to the chancellor.

39:11.740 --> 39:15.440
- Can you take me now?
- Oh, now. Yeah, sure. Okay.

39:15.440 --> 39:18.630
Gimme key. Gimme key.

39:20.010 --> 39:24.710
So you admit you attacked
my eye on porpoise.

39:24.720 --> 39:27.780
Yes, I did it on porpoise.

39:27.790 --> 39:29.220
I told you this!

39:29.220 --> 39:32.110
I told you all she did
this to me on porpoise!

39:32.840 --> 39:37.610
- And to apologize...
- Yes? Yes?

39:39.430 --> 39:42.070
...Me and my friends
and the other prisoners,

39:42.070 --> 39:46.200
we'd like to perform a song
tomorrow night for you, your family

39:46.200 --> 39:49.110
and any other yerbanians
that you'd like to invite.

39:51.880 --> 39:53.440
Why you want this?

39:53.580 --> 40:00.570
Uh, just to apologize and...
quit it... and to honor you.

40:00.620 --> 40:04.020
I mean, wouldn't you like to see
a great American performance?

40:04.020 --> 40:08.020
See what?
You puncture my last working eye!

40:08.030 --> 40:10.860
All I see is black nothing!

40:10.860 --> 40:13.760
Please, let us show you how
sorry we are for blinding you

40:13.770 --> 40:17.400
and for murdering your okkatapus.

40:18.470 --> 40:20.770
Well, okay.

40:20.770 --> 40:23.140
- Yay.
- Now, take her away from me!

40:23.140 --> 40:24.830
Yes, chancellor!

40:27.930 --> 40:31.860
- Now!
- Oh, now. Okay. Sure.

40:37.860 --> 40:39.560
Hello, buddies.

40:39.560 --> 40:47.960
Make clapter for Tori Vega and
the kid from Hollywood art.

40:47.970 --> 40:50.300
People of Yerba, we
dedicate this performance

40:50.300 --> 40:53.670
to you and your esteemed chancellor.
