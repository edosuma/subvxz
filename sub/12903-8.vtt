00:00.468 --> 00:03.202
<i>Previously on "Angie Tribeca"...</i>

00:03.204 --> 00:04.503
She's awake.

00:04.505 --> 00:06.672
Sergeant Pepper? Angie.

00:06.674 --> 00:09.308
How long have I been out?
About nine months.

00:09.310 --> 00:11.710
Next you're gonna tell me
you're seeing someone else.

00:12.480 --> 00:16.047
Scholls thinks I had the baby with some chick
in Canada. Yeah, don't worry about it.

00:16.050 --> 00:18.984
Who's his mother? Is that really
important, who's his mother?

00:18.986 --> 00:21.687
Do people really care
who their mom is?

00:21.689 --> 00:23.055
I'm ready to work, Lieutenant.

00:23.057 --> 00:24.556
You just got out of a coma.

00:24.558 --> 00:26.658
Hey, if Tribeca says
she's ready, then she's ready.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.060
Or do I have to show you
my first?

00:28.062 --> 00:30.362
I was wondering
if I could see the visitors log

00:30.364 --> 00:32.031
from when I was in a coma.

00:33.200 --> 00:36.668
Has anyone here heard of
the website "MeetNCheat.org"?

00:36.670 --> 00:38.537
Their server's been hacked.

00:38.539 --> 00:40.806
This is all the stolen
data from the Meet'N'Cheat hack,

00:40.808 --> 00:43.075
names and addresses of
all the members on the site.

00:43.077 --> 00:45.544
They're making it look like
the LAPD is publishing it.

00:45.546 --> 00:47.713
My name is on the list.
Mayor Joe Perry.

00:47.715 --> 00:49.648
Username... MayorJoePerry1.

00:49.650 --> 00:51.717
Password...
"YesThatMayorJoePerry."

00:51.719 --> 00:55.387
I'd like to introduce you
to Special Agent Diane Duran.

00:55.389 --> 00:59.024
So, Mayhem Global hires
Duran to hack Meet'N'Cheat.

00:59.026 --> 01:00.359
She draws us in.

01:00.361 --> 01:02.261
Then she hacks us
from the inside.

01:02.263 --> 01:03.595
But why?

01:03.597 --> 01:06.231
Sergeant Pepper.
I know he's still alive.

01:06.233 --> 01:09.601
If you're serious about finding
Pepper, he'll meet you here.

01:10.905 --> 01:13.238
I found out that
the biggest criminal

01:13.240 --> 01:15.240
is not out on the streets.

01:15.242 --> 01:17.109
He's in the mayor's office.

01:17.111 --> 01:18.343
Mayor Perry?

01:18.345 --> 01:20.045
Voter fraud, racketeering,

01:20.047 --> 01:22.614
money laundering,
racketeering fraud,

01:22.616 --> 01:24.216
voter laundering.

01:24.218 --> 01:26.051
The list goes on and on.

01:26.053 --> 01:28.053
What about Mayhem Global?

01:28.055 --> 01:29.588
I am Mayhem Global.

01:29.590 --> 01:32.191
There's one number
programmed into this phone.

01:32.193 --> 01:35.594
When you're ready to be part
of the revolution, call it.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.229
What's the point of any of this?

01:37.231 --> 01:38.597
We have evidence, a confession,

01:38.599 --> 01:40.532
and the bad guy doesn't
spend one night in jail?

01:40.534 --> 01:43.502
That's the system, Tribeca.
The system sucks.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.973
Pieced it all together?

01:47.975 --> 01:49.942
Almost.

01:51.278 --> 01:52.711
Now I'm done.

01:52.713 --> 01:55.214
<i>Currently on "Angie Tribeca"...</i>

01:55.216 --> 01:57.416
You're just perfect.

01:57.418 --> 02:00.119
We're gonna take such good care
of you.

02:00.121 --> 02:01.787
The Freezematic 15,000.

02:01.789 --> 02:04.123
Once this bad boy gets going,
it's gonna chill your milk,

02:04.125 --> 02:07.092
preserve your meat, call your
sister, cure hepatitis.

02:07.094 --> 02:08.594
Just sign there.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.631
Yep.
You're looking at 28 cubic feet

02:12.633 --> 02:15.134
of self-regulated,
vacuum-sealed cold.

02:17.471 --> 02:18.804
That's a separate
produce crisper

02:18.806 --> 02:20.772
with an independent
temperature control.

02:20.774 --> 02:22.841
Check out this freezer.

02:24.245 --> 02:25.677
A dead body fro...

02:25.679 --> 02:27.312
That's not supposed to be there.

02:27.314 --> 02:32.317
But I just plugged it in,
and it's already ice-cold.

02:32.319 --> 02:34.419
That's pretty good.

02:36.000 --> 02:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:43.531 --> 02:45.464
Tell us what happened.

02:45.466 --> 02:46.865
Well, growing up,

02:46.867 --> 02:48.867
I always thought I'd be
a pro football player,

02:48.869 --> 02:52.304
but I got a bum knee, so went
into the family business...

02:52.306 --> 02:53.839
Real estate.

02:53.841 --> 02:56.441
Market takes a tumble,
here I am.

02:56.443 --> 02:58.110
How about what happened today.

02:58.112 --> 03:00.846
Got up about 4:30,
hit the snooze button...

03:00.848 --> 03:03.015
Just the one time...
Got up, showered.

03:03.017 --> 03:05.317
At work, sir.
What happened at work?

03:05.319 --> 03:08.820
Let's see. I got to where I pick
up the truck for deliveries.

03:08.822 --> 03:09.855
Finally.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.490
I pull into
the parking structure.

03:11.492 --> 03:14.026
Level "A" is full,
Level "B" is full.

03:14.028 --> 03:17.062
Level "C", there was a compact
spot, but I made it work.

03:17.064 --> 03:20.365
What's the name of the company
you work for?

03:20.367 --> 03:22.568
Golden Gate Fridge.

03:29.877 --> 03:33.912
<i>I am sick and tired
of being sick and tired.</i>

03:33.914 --> 03:35.480
<i>I'm sick and tired of it.</i>

03:35.482 --> 03:37.549
Councilman Dreyfuss
is airing out

03:37.551 --> 03:40.752
all of Mayor Perry's
dirty laundry.

03:40.754 --> 03:43.255
<i>Is this who you want
leading your city</i>

03:43.257 --> 03:44.923
<i>for another four years?</i>

03:44.925 --> 03:46.225
He actually has
some good points.

03:46.227 --> 03:48.694
It's too bad the old guy
doesn't have a shot.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.229
He'd need a miracle to win.

03:50.231 --> 03:52.931
And what are the odds
of two miracles in one month?

03:52.933 --> 03:54.099
Not likely.

03:54.101 --> 03:56.435
So, where are we
on the body in the fridge?

03:56.437 --> 03:59.037
We're waiting on Scholls for
an I.D. and a cause of death.

03:59.039 --> 04:00.839
I talked to someone
at the refrigerator company.

04:00.841 --> 04:02.241
They're gonna send someone out
to talk to us

04:02.243 --> 04:03.909
between the hours
of 4:00 and 8:00.

04:03.911 --> 04:06.245
Wow, that's a huge window.
No appointments?

04:06.247 --> 04:07.713
You can get a specific time,

04:07.715 --> 04:09.248
but you have to wait
like three weeks.

04:09.250 --> 04:11.550
Okay, so I'll have Tanner
wait around for the fridge guy.

04:11.552 --> 04:13.585
You guys check in with Scholls

04:13.587 --> 04:15.187
and see if she has a name
for us.

04:15.189 --> 04:16.954
Will do, Lieutenant.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.892
So, I tried calling you
this weekend.

04:20.894 --> 04:23.061
Yeah, I dropped my phone
in the toilet.

04:23.063 --> 04:24.896
Total write-off.

04:24.898 --> 04:28.533
And then I immediately got this
new one with a different number.

04:28.535 --> 04:30.535
But we're still on for bowling
tonight.

04:30.537 --> 04:31.937
Yeah, actually, I can't.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.872
I dropped my bowling ball
in the toilet.

04:33.874 --> 04:36.108
Total write-off.

04:36.110 --> 04:38.377
And then I immediately
got this one.

04:38.379 --> 04:42.147
But the guy told me to wait a couple
days until the marble settles.

04:46.487 --> 04:49.655
Tribeca, Geils. Come with me.

04:49.657 --> 04:51.690
I want to show you something.

04:54.094 --> 04:56.328
Disgusting, isn't it?

04:56.330 --> 04:58.163
Horrible. A cat did that.

04:59.433 --> 05:00.666
Anyway...

05:00.668 --> 05:02.401
How can I help you?

05:02.403 --> 05:05.170
We were wondering if you were
able to I.D. the fridge corpse.

05:05.172 --> 05:07.639
The very cold case, yes.
Come with me.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.474
I want you to see something.

05:09.476 --> 05:12.344
The deceased's name
is Charles Michael Bucket,

05:12.346 --> 05:14.313
and his fingerprints
match exactly those

05:14.315 --> 05:16.782
of a sailor who's been missing
for three days.

05:16.784 --> 05:19.084
Navy? Worse. Coast Guard.

05:19.086 --> 05:22.220
Dr. Scholls, can you show the
detectives what you showed me?

05:25.859 --> 05:29.027
Trying to make me jealous?

05:30.831 --> 05:33.265
Is that a whistle?
In his windpipe.

05:33.267 --> 05:35.834
And something tells me
he wasn't born with it.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.769
Although he did die with it.

05:37.771 --> 05:40.839
We think someone shoved a whistle
down his throat after a struggle.

05:40.841 --> 05:43.008
You can see the defensive wounds
here and here.

05:43.010 --> 05:45.510
Why a whistle? Someone trying
to send a message?

05:45.512 --> 05:47.012
Don't blow whistles?

05:47.014 --> 05:49.548
Someone's telling him
not to be a whistle-blower.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.350
But what was he blowing
the whistle on?

05:51.352 --> 05:52.784
No idea.

05:52.786 --> 05:54.986
We examined every other orifice
several times

05:54.988 --> 05:56.188
but found no evidence.

05:56.190 --> 05:57.823
We'll try
and take out the whistle

05:57.825 --> 05:59.291
and see if we can pull some DNA.

05:59.293 --> 06:02.094
Meanwhile, we'll go pay a visit
to the Coast Guard.

06:12.339 --> 06:14.506
The Commandant's
a very busy man, you know.

06:14.508 --> 06:16.875
We appreciate you getting us in,
Petty Officer Snick.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.744
Chief Petty Officer Snick,
thank you very much.

06:18.746 --> 06:21.246
And I thought you said you were
coming at 2:00. Isn't it 2:00?

06:21.248 --> 06:24.082
It's 1:50, which means I only got a
20-minute lunch break, but whatever.

06:24.084 --> 06:26.518
It's fine. I'll have a candy bar
or something.

06:26.520 --> 06:29.154
Sorry, Petty Officer. We didn't
think it was a big deal.

06:30.190 --> 06:33.225
Detectives,
Commandant Don Van Zandt.

06:33.227 --> 06:34.893
Come in, detectives.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.595
That'll be all, Snick.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.330
You're welcome.

06:38.332 --> 06:42.234
First of all, I'd like to thank
you for finding Seaman Bucket.

06:42.236 --> 06:45.003
We are a brotherhood, and when
one of our brothers go missing,

06:45.005 --> 06:47.038
it hurts the whole
Coast Guard family.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.573
If there's anything
that I could do

06:48.575 --> 06:51.443
to assist in your investigation,
don't be afraid to ask.

06:51.445 --> 06:52.911
Well, for starters...

06:52.913 --> 06:54.579
I'm afraid that's all the time
that I've got today.

06:54.581 --> 06:55.947
CPO Snick will see you out.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.849
We were really hoping to
ask you some questions,

06:57.851 --> 06:59.551
Commandant Don Van Zandt.

06:59.553 --> 07:02.821
I know you were, Detective.
I know you were.

07:07.861 --> 07:09.728
You listen here, Popeye.

07:09.730 --> 07:12.597
This is a murder investigation,
and we're the murder police.

07:12.599 --> 07:14.433
So start talking.

07:14.435 --> 07:16.468
I think you're outside of
your jurisdiction, Detective.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.303
This is an internal matter
for the Coast Guard,

07:18.305 --> 07:20.539
thus to be handled internally
by the Coast Guard

07:20.541 --> 07:22.140
with no outside help.

07:22.142 --> 07:25.710
All due respect, Commandant,
this base is in L.A. County,

07:25.712 --> 07:27.112
so when somebody's killed
in L.A.,

07:27.114 --> 07:29.314
it is very much
in our jurisdiction.

07:31.718 --> 07:33.819
Now, we'd like to interview
his bunkmates.

07:33.821 --> 07:35.921
We want to talk to the last
person who saw him alive,

07:35.923 --> 07:38.223
and we want to know why he ended
up dead in a refrigerator.

07:38.225 --> 07:39.758
I don't know how he disappeared

07:39.760 --> 07:41.059
or why he ended up
in that refrigerator

07:41.061 --> 07:43.094
or how he got that whistle
down his throat,

07:43.096 --> 07:45.063
but if our investigation
turns up anything of interest,

07:45.065 --> 07:46.465
I'll be sure to call you.

07:46.467 --> 07:48.066
CPO Snick will see you out.

07:48.068 --> 07:49.935
We'll see ourselves out.

07:49.937 --> 07:54.039
Okay. It's my one job,
but go ahead.

07:58.912 --> 08:01.813
We need base access, we need to
interview his shipmates,

08:01.815 --> 08:03.815
but the Coast Guard keeps
shutting us down at every turn.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.851
Because they know something
that they don't want to tell us.

08:05.853 --> 08:08.353
It's a classic case
of keeping something secret.

08:08.355 --> 08:12.491
If they want to get into a jurisdictional
dick-measuring contest, I'm all for it.

08:12.493 --> 08:15.026
It sounds like fun,
and I like my chances.

08:15.028 --> 08:17.295
Go talk to the Melanie Burke
at the D.A.'s office

08:17.297 --> 08:18.763
and see if she can help us out.

08:18.765 --> 08:20.432
Got it.

08:20.434 --> 08:22.334
Lieutenant. Yep?

08:22.336 --> 08:24.169
As predicted,
the refrigerator guy

08:24.171 --> 08:25.871
came as soon as
I got in the shower.

08:25.873 --> 08:28.173
Damn it! That's so frustrating.
It's like they know.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.475
So I can either wait till
tomorrow at the same time,

08:30.477 --> 08:32.943
or I can go to the warehouse
in Long Beach and talk to them.

08:32.946 --> 08:35.179
That's a hell of a long drive,
but I don't think it can wait.

08:35.182 --> 08:38.450
I'll be all right. There's a
Dave & Buster's right next door.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.052
Tanner!

08:41.054 --> 08:43.688
I'm gonna go with you.

08:47.628 --> 08:49.728
This guy's going to the chair.

08:49.730 --> 08:52.898
As God as my witness,
he's gonna fry.

08:52.900 --> 08:55.367
Just backing up a bit,
we don't know who did it.

08:55.369 --> 08:57.402
Yeah, but we appreciate
your enthusiasm.

08:57.404 --> 08:58.803
Someone showed up to work today.

08:58.805 --> 09:00.238
All right, what do you guys
want?

09:00.240 --> 09:01.540
Just tell me what you want,

09:01.542 --> 09:02.874
and I'm gonna put it
in your little hands.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.376
All right?
You want a court order?

09:04.378 --> 09:06.745
You want a subpoena?
You want a grand jury?

09:06.747 --> 09:08.647
I'm gonna get you a grand jury.

09:08.649 --> 09:10.482
We're not quite there yet,
Melanie,

09:10.484 --> 09:12.484
but good to know
we have you in our back pocket.

09:12.486 --> 09:14.653
All right, so hit me.
Anything. Give it to me.

09:14.655 --> 09:16.655
Well, I guess we could start
by getting subpoenas

09:16.657 --> 09:18.723
for some of Bucket's shipmates.
Already done.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.392
How about a search warrant?

09:20.394 --> 09:22.894
Check your inbox. Already there.
Did it this morning.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.496
Can I use your restroom?
You just did.

09:24.498 --> 09:26.531
Validate parking?
I would love to.

09:26.533 --> 09:28.400
Parking.

09:29.369 --> 09:31.336
Got here at 10:21.

09:31.338 --> 09:34.406
It's 11:04 now, so that's...

09:36.910 --> 09:39.477
That's...

09:40.247 --> 09:42.414
That's 28... 28 minutes.

09:42.416 --> 09:43.882
No, that's like 40 minutes.

09:43.884 --> 09:46.518
Shh. Okay.
These are 15-minute increments.

09:46.520 --> 09:48.219
There we go. We'll just pay.

09:48.221 --> 09:50.855
I got this. Please, just
give us our ticket back.

09:50.857 --> 09:52.223
Can you just...

09:52.225 --> 09:53.692
'Cause I had it,
and now I don't have it.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.427
Just give it back.
This one is...

09:55.429 --> 09:57.596
You can stick it together.

09:57.598 --> 09:59.264
They're not lickies.

09:59.266 --> 10:02.767
It's fine.
You don't have to... Come on.

10:05.038 --> 10:06.638
17 hours. 17 hours.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.206
This is great. Thank you.

10:11.778 --> 10:14.079
Come on, guys! Hurry up!

10:14.081 --> 10:17.616
I told you. I don't know anything
about no body in no fridge.

10:17.618 --> 10:19.818
So, no one looks
into the refrigerators

10:19.820 --> 10:21.486
when you take them off the boat?

10:21.488 --> 10:24.055
Of course. Every product
gets quality-controlled.

10:24.057 --> 10:27.492
Nobody thought to raise a red flag
when they saw a body in a fridge?

10:27.494 --> 10:29.728
When my guys checked it,
there was no body, okay?

10:29.730 --> 10:31.663
My guys know what they're doing.

10:33.233 --> 10:35.867
Lieutenant, I'm gonna need you
to look away for this one.

10:39.940 --> 10:43.141
Mr. Sterelli,
let me ask you something.

10:43.977 --> 10:47.245
How do you feel
about Dave & Buster's?

10:47.247 --> 10:49.748
It's the number-one destination
for family fun.

10:49.750 --> 10:52.417
Everybody knows that..

10:52.419 --> 10:54.586
How about if I told you
I had 5,000 tickets

10:54.588 --> 10:56.855
with your name all on them?

10:56.857 --> 10:58.523
I'm listening.

10:58.525 --> 11:01.660
Have you had any interaction
with the Coast Guard?

11:03.664 --> 11:05.096
Yeah.

11:05.098 --> 11:06.865
They come around sometimes,

11:06.867 --> 11:09.100
make sure the shipments
get through with no hassles.

11:09.102 --> 11:12.570
What shipments? They don't tell me
nothing, and I don't ask nothing.

11:15.609 --> 11:17.676
Every once in a while,
a shipment of appliances

11:17.678 --> 11:20.712
comes off through the boat
that I'm not allowed to inspect.

11:20.714 --> 11:23.948
They put it in a Coast Guard
truck and take it off my hands.

11:23.950 --> 11:26.051
That's all I know.

11:26.053 --> 11:28.887
Anything else, you're gonna
have to ask the Coast Guard.

11:32.793 --> 11:36.528
Thank you, Mr. Sterelli.
Thank you very much.

11:47.974 --> 11:51.643
Excuse me!
Excuse me, seamen and women!

11:51.645 --> 11:53.678
We're wondering if anybody
has any information

11:53.680 --> 11:55.346
on the death of Charlie Bucket.

11:58.985 --> 12:00.885
I got information.

12:00.887 --> 12:04.222
But if you want me to talk,
you got to beat me.

12:05.692 --> 12:08.326
Not you. The other lady.

12:26.847 --> 12:29.681
Seaman Bucket was my bunkmate.

12:29.683 --> 12:31.883
We were closer than brothers.

12:31.885 --> 12:35.186
I know this is difficult,
but can you think of any reason

12:35.188 --> 12:37.188
why someone would
want to hurt him?

12:37.190 --> 12:39.090
No. No idea.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.593
He was a great sailor
and really popular,

12:41.595 --> 12:43.361
although, the last couple weeks,

12:43.363 --> 12:46.197
it did seem like he really
had something on his mind.

12:46.199 --> 12:48.700
I'd say to him, "Hey, Charlie.
You got something on your mind?"

12:48.702 --> 12:50.568
And he would say, "What?"

12:50.570 --> 12:52.737
Like he had something
on his mind.

12:52.739 --> 12:54.873
You have any idea what happened
to his stuff...

12:54.875 --> 12:57.709
Clothes, footlocker,
detailed diary?

12:57.711 --> 12:59.878
Yeah, I did find
one detailed diary.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.780
I didn't think anything of it
at the time.

13:01.782 --> 13:03.448
You want to take a look at it?

13:03.450 --> 13:05.650
It might help.

13:07.821 --> 13:08.920
Yo.

13:08.922 --> 13:13.525
"Smash Mouth" is two words.

13:16.730 --> 13:21.332
A Coast Guard truck? This late?

13:21.334 --> 13:23.301
We should go check it out.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.836
We don't have a warrant.

13:24.838 --> 13:27.572
I think we'll be okay.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.142
What the hell was that?

13:31.144 --> 13:32.677
I can't wink.

13:34.080 --> 13:36.581
Tanner, hit the siren.

14:04.444 --> 14:06.277
Evening, detectives.

14:06.279 --> 14:08.179
Is it? How can I help you?

14:08.181 --> 14:09.781
How's about you open
the back of that truck

14:09.783 --> 14:11.516
and let us have a look-see?

14:11.518 --> 14:13.151
I'm afraid I can't do that,
Detective.

14:13.153 --> 14:14.953
I'm on official
Coast Guard business,

14:14.955 --> 14:16.654
so unless you want to take it up

14:16.656 --> 14:18.623
with the President
of the United States...

14:18.625 --> 14:20.959
I'll do that.

14:20.961 --> 14:25.196
President Obama,
Lieutenant Pritikin Atkins.

14:25.198 --> 14:28.266
Is it okay if we look inside
a Coast Guard truck?

14:29.569 --> 14:31.135
Thank you. Good night, sir.

14:31.137 --> 14:34.038
Wait, can I talk to him?
He hung up.

14:35.175 --> 14:37.408
Is he buying it?

14:37.410 --> 14:39.377
It's hard to read his face.

14:40.647 --> 14:42.180
What's he doing now?

14:42.182 --> 14:45.917
He's still looking with
a suspicious look on his face.

14:45.919 --> 14:47.819
What are you two
whispering about?

14:47.821 --> 14:49.821
Vitamins. Ke$ha.

14:51.391 --> 14:55.226
Vice President .45 says
open the back of the truck.

14:59.032 --> 15:02.333
Hey, how's it going?
Are we in America?

15:02.335 --> 15:04.202
Canadians?

15:04.204 --> 15:07.205
What in the name of Tim Hortons
is going on here?

15:07.207 --> 15:11.175
Mr. President,
we have a situation.

15:14.681 --> 15:16.614
I didn't know
the Coast Guard deals

15:16.616 --> 15:18.216
in the trafficking
of illegal immigrants.

15:18.218 --> 15:19.884
There's a lot you don't know,
Detective,

15:19.886 --> 15:23.788
like how to apply eyeliner or
who won Best Picture in 1984.

15:23.790 --> 15:25.189
"Amadeus."

15:25.191 --> 15:27.592
What were you doing with
a truckload of Canadians?

15:27.594 --> 15:29.160
Answer me!

15:32.098 --> 15:35.433
Okay, you want to
play that game?

15:35.435 --> 15:36.935
Well, we just found your DNA

15:36.937 --> 15:39.103
on the whistle inside of
Seaman Bucket's throat,

15:39.105 --> 15:40.638
so you're going down either way.

15:40.640 --> 15:43.074
If you cooperate, maybe we can
get the charges reduced.

15:50.650 --> 15:53.885
I don't have to answer to you.
I only answer to one man.

15:54.888 --> 15:59.590
But there is one tiny bit of
information you should know.

15:59.592 --> 16:02.527
I have a horrible
shellfish allergy.

16:04.230 --> 16:06.431
Whoa, put down the shrimp!
Don't do it, man. No.

16:06.433 --> 16:07.966
Put it down. No. That's
no way to go out.

16:07.968 --> 16:09.968
Nice knowing you, detectives.
Not like this!

16:09.970 --> 16:11.469
Put the shrimp do... And Angie,

16:11.471 --> 16:13.638
Sergeant Pepper says hello.
Don't do it, man!

16:13.640 --> 16:15.573
Dreyfuss for mayor! No! No!

16:24.584 --> 16:26.818
This is great. Case closed.

16:26.820 --> 16:29.854
We got our murderer, and we didn't
have to watch a jury screw it up.

16:29.856 --> 16:31.322
Who wants to see a flick?

16:31.324 --> 16:34.459
This isn't over.
We have to go after Van Zandt.

16:34.461 --> 16:36.861
There's a massive conspiracy
going on here.

16:36.863 --> 16:39.864
Officer Snick put a shrimp in
his mouth just to protect it.

16:39.866 --> 16:42.200
I don't want to do 3-D.
It makes me dizzy.

16:42.202 --> 16:43.801
Yeah.

16:43.803 --> 16:46.704
We cannot trust the Coast Guard
to investigate itself.

16:46.706 --> 16:49.307
I'm not gonna stand here and watch
this get lost in the shuffle.

16:49.309 --> 16:51.275
Tribeca, the buck
has officially been passed.

16:51.277 --> 16:53.511
It's Immigration
and JAG Corp's problem now.

16:53.513 --> 16:54.946
We all want to
put the bad guys away

16:54.948 --> 16:57.482
and see the good guys get it all
wrapped up nicely,

16:57.484 --> 17:00.118
which is why I'm thinking we see
"Jacker Reacher" at 8:15.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.853
I saw it.

17:07.961 --> 17:09.894
Hey.

17:09.896 --> 17:11.329
Hey.

17:11.330 --> 17:13.164
Brown stuff. Rocks.

17:13.165 --> 17:16.067
When did it become so hard for
the good guys to do any good?

17:16.069 --> 17:19.436
Sometimes I think we'd make more
of a difference without the badge.

17:22.242 --> 17:24.242
You've just been so different
lately.

17:24.243 --> 17:26.844
I'm still incredibly attracted
to you.

17:28.848 --> 17:30.748
But something's changed.

17:30.750 --> 17:34.986
I'm in a bad place, Geils.
You don't want any part of this.

17:36.489 --> 17:39.223
We're doing good, Angie.
We're making a difference.

17:39.225 --> 17:43.327
At the end of the day, you just
got to leave the job at the job.

17:43.329 --> 17:44.896
You're right.

17:44.898 --> 17:47.799
Guess I'm just having
a bad year.

17:49.235 --> 17:50.701
I'm gonna call it a night.

17:50.703 --> 17:53.771
Angie, promise me
you won't do anything crazy.

17:53.773 --> 17:56.307
I promise.

18:15.929 --> 18:18.930
Set a course for Dreamland.

18:18.932 --> 18:20.131
Whoa!

18:20.133 --> 18:22.600
Relax.
I'm not here to arrest you.

18:23.937 --> 18:25.403
Or sleep with you.

18:26.806 --> 18:27.972
Take me to Pepper.

18:27.974 --> 18:29.640
Never.

18:29.642 --> 18:33.211
Aah! Your feet are freezing!

18:33.213 --> 18:35.746
Aaah!

18:35.748 --> 18:37.381
Okay, I'll take you!

18:46.759 --> 18:48.893
So, what are the Canadians for?

18:48.895 --> 18:50.962
Are you putting together
some kind of army?

18:50.964 --> 18:54.132
Not soldiers. Voters.

18:55.335 --> 18:57.969
It's right up here on the right.

19:18.091 --> 19:20.925
Face forward.
Thanks, Commandant.

19:20.927 --> 19:23.194
I'm done with you.

19:23.196 --> 19:26.264
Here's your ChapStick back.

19:34.974 --> 19:36.474
Drive.

19:36.476 --> 19:38.309
Not until you tell me
what the hell you're up to.

19:38.311 --> 19:40.344
You know what I see
when I look out this window?

19:40.346 --> 19:42.647
No. No more bullshit.

19:42.649 --> 19:46.050
You're importing Canadians to
vote for Dreyfuss? What is this?

19:46.052 --> 19:48.519
Mayor Perry will not be
the next mayor of Los Angeles.

19:48.521 --> 19:51.222
He's gonna win. He's killing
Dreyfuss in the polls.

19:51.224 --> 19:53.624
Mayor Perry will not be
the next mayor of Los Angeles.

19:53.626 --> 19:56.060
One way or another,
he's gonna lose,

19:56.062 --> 19:57.562
and there isn't a damn thing
you can do abo...

19:57.564 --> 19:58.896
I'm in.

19:58.898 --> 20:00.464
Really?

20:00.466 --> 20:02.700
I thought that was gonna be
a lot harder.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.735
Great. Good news.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.370
Where do we start?

20:06.372 --> 20:08.372
Just act normal,
and at a certain point,

20:08.374 --> 20:10.341
the Commandant will contact you.

20:10.343 --> 20:12.410
I'm really happy
you're joining us, Angie.
