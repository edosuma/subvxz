00:03.394 --> 00:05.266
[siren wailing]

00:12.099 --> 00:14.014
[siren blipping, horn honking]

00:18.714 --> 00:21.456
The State Department's
breathing down my neck.

00:21.499 --> 00:25.068
I'm due in MTAC in 15 minutes
to brief the White House.

00:25.112 --> 00:26.635
Sir.
Shut up, DiNozzo!

00:28.115 --> 00:30.682
Agent David! Put that equipment
back in the truck.

00:30.726 --> 00:33.163
This is an FBI
crime scene now.

00:33.207 --> 00:35.861
If this isn't rectified
in 48 hours,

00:35.905 --> 00:39.474
I want DiNozzo and McGee's
badges on my desk.

01:11.810 --> 01:14.683
[protesters clamoring]

01:17.033 --> 01:18.426
NEWSMAN: We're outside the
United States Embassy

01:18.469 --> 01:21.559
in Vlastimil, Belgravia,
where a crowd has gathered,

01:21.603 --> 01:25.041
anxiously awaiting the arrival
of Belgravian Defense Minister

01:25.085 --> 01:27.609
Andor Gorgova, for his first
face-to-face meeting

01:27.652 --> 01:30.133
with the
U.S. Secretary of State.

01:30.177 --> 01:33.658
PROTESTERS [chanting]:
Not our war! Not our war!

01:33.702 --> 01:35.007
NEWSMAN:
Delegates from both countries

01:35.051 --> 01:36.792
have been
in closed-door sessions,

01:36.835 --> 01:38.446
laying the groundwork
for a treaty

01:38.489 --> 01:41.623
establishing a U.S.-forward base
in Belgravia.

01:41.666 --> 01:44.887
Gorgova all but defines
the New Europe.

01:44.930 --> 01:46.889
Aligning his country
with the United States...

01:46.932 --> 01:49.805
PROTESTERS:
Not our war! Not our war!

01:49.848 --> 01:51.894
NEWSMAN: ...have been constant
protests, causing some...

01:51.937 --> 01:53.852
PROTESTERS:
Not our war! Not our war!

01:53.896 --> 01:55.854
NEWSMAN: U.S. Marines
and Secret Service agents

01:55.898 --> 01:59.162
from both countries stand guard.

01:59.206 --> 02:01.599
The official signing
of the treaty will be tomorrow,

02:01.643 --> 02:03.645
at the Royal Palace,

02:03.688 --> 02:06.691
with the Belgravian Prime
Minister in attendance.

02:08.867 --> 02:11.131
This is Warren Gates
reporting from Vlastimil.

02:45.077 --> 02:45.774
Stop!

02:46.905 --> 02:49.343
Stop! Stoi!

02:49.386 --> 02:50.170
Stoi!

02:57.873 --> 03:00.180
[shouting, screaming]

03:12.453 --> 03:14.455
[Tony laughing]

03:16.979 --> 03:19.982
Ooh... Okay, boss.
Here we go.

03:23.290 --> 03:24.682
[goofy voice]:
My eyes are so close together,

03:24.726 --> 03:26.902
but I got big ears.

03:26.945 --> 03:29.948
Having fun there,
are you, DiNozzo?

03:29.992 --> 03:31.036
Oh, hey, boss.

03:31.080 --> 03:32.821
It's just this new app;
it's great.

03:32.864 --> 03:34.779
It's pretty funny,
sometimes.

03:34.823 --> 03:37.086
Wanna see what I did to McGee?
He almost looks normal.

03:37.129 --> 03:38.130
No.

03:39.523 --> 03:40.176
Thanks, boss.

03:43.135 --> 03:44.833
So why didn't
you answer my text?

03:44.876 --> 03:46.617
Text?!

03:46.661 --> 03:49.098
Oh... gosh.

03:49.141 --> 03:51.274
Sorry, it was on "vibrate."

03:51.318 --> 03:52.797
ZIVA: It is Tuesday, Tony.
The blood drive?

03:52.841 --> 03:54.103
8:00 to 10:00.

03:54.146 --> 03:56.453
We all gave.
Oh, n...

03:56.497 --> 03:58.238
Where were you?

03:58.281 --> 04:00.544
Oh, that's today,
from 8:00 to 10:00.

04:00.588 --> 04:03.982
And it's just after 10:00,
so I guess, well...

04:04.026 --> 04:05.549
There's always next year,
though.

04:05.593 --> 04:07.072
They're gonna be there
every morning this week.

04:07.116 --> 04:09.249
Of course, I could always
try and do it tomorrow.

04:10.641 --> 04:12.817
You're pushing
to make Agent of the Year.

04:12.861 --> 04:14.297
It's not going to look good
if you don't give.

04:14.341 --> 04:16.343
[phone ringing]

04:16.386 --> 04:17.735
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

04:19.694 --> 04:20.869
Yeah. I'll be right up.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.918
[Tony clears his throat]

04:30.313 --> 04:31.619
This...

04:31.662 --> 04:34.491
is my Rembrandt.

04:42.891 --> 04:45.285
We were aware of
opposition to the treaty,

04:45.328 --> 04:46.677
but an assassination attempt

04:46.721 --> 04:47.678
wasn't on the radar.

04:47.722 --> 04:49.114
So what happens next?

04:49.158 --> 04:51.160
Thankfully,
Defense Minister Gorgova

04:51.203 --> 04:53.118
won't be intimidated
by terrorists.

04:53.162 --> 04:57.035
The Secretary of State
suggested, for security reasons,

04:57.079 --> 04:59.647
that the signing of the treaty
be brought here.

04:59.690 --> 05:01.692
We need protective
service assistance.

05:01.736 --> 05:03.215
GENERAL:
CID is up

05:03.259 --> 05:05.305
in the rotation, so we're
taking the lead, Leon.

05:05.348 --> 05:06.741
But we need some help from NCIS.

05:06.784 --> 05:08.133
VANCE:
That's no problem.

05:08.177 --> 05:11.267
But I'd like to discuss
Sergeant Jennings' death.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.790
WOLFSON:
That investigation

05:12.834 --> 05:15.532
is being handled by the
Belgravian authorities

05:15.576 --> 05:18.492
and the State Department's
regional security office.

05:18.535 --> 05:20.929
Now, the cause of the Marine
guard's death is known.

05:20.972 --> 05:24.149
They're focused
on a local dissident group.

05:24.193 --> 05:26.717
Not much more
needs to be done.

05:26.761 --> 05:28.240
Special Agent Gibbs.

05:28.284 --> 05:30.155
Question:
What's the disposition

05:30.199 --> 05:32.636
of Sergeant Jennings' body?It's being sent

05:32.680 --> 05:35.422
to the Armed Forces Institute
of Pathology, in Dover.

05:35.465 --> 05:37.685
So you're not asking us
to investigate his death.

05:37.728 --> 05:39.817
You just want us

05:39.861 --> 05:41.471
to protect Gorgova?WOLFSON:
General?

05:41.515 --> 05:43.168
No.

05:43.212 --> 05:44.518
We've got him covered,
and the other members

05:44.561 --> 05:46.911
of the official
delegation.

05:46.955 --> 05:48.478
We're giving you guys
a break on this one.

05:48.522 --> 05:50.872
Just as a precaution,
until the treaty signing,

05:50.915 --> 05:54.658
we need NCIS to protect
Gorgova's daughter, Adriana.

05:54.702 --> 05:58.227
She's a graduate student
at John Hamilton University.

05:58.270 --> 06:00.621
Anything we can do
to assist.

06:00.664 --> 06:02.100
Appreciate your help, Leon.

06:03.667 --> 06:05.495
Adriana Gorgova

06:05.539 --> 06:06.888
has been studying
in the United States

06:06.931 --> 06:08.672
for the last six years.

06:08.716 --> 06:11.240
She received a bachelor's degree
from Princeton University,

06:11.283 --> 06:12.937
and she's currently
a graduate student

06:12.981 --> 06:15.853
in Diplomatic Studies
at John Hamilton.

06:15.897 --> 06:17.638
Pale, dull...

06:17.681 --> 06:19.335
a brainiac.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.685
She's a female you, Timmy.

06:21.729 --> 06:24.079
Her father is
a self-made millionaire.

06:24.122 --> 06:27.387
He modernized factories
and resurrected the moribund

06:27.430 --> 06:29.476
Belgravian transportation
equipment industries.

06:29.519 --> 06:31.826
Then turned to politics.
Became the country's

06:31.869 --> 06:33.741
Defense Minister.Rich daddy.

06:33.784 --> 06:35.438
Sounding better
all the time, Timmy.

06:35.482 --> 06:37.092
GIBBS:
What'd the embassy say?

06:37.135 --> 06:38.833
They tried to set up an
introductory meeting for us

06:38.876 --> 06:40.356
with Adriana,
but she was unavailable

06:40.400 --> 06:41.705
because of her class schedule.

06:41.749 --> 06:43.881
However...

06:43.925 --> 06:44.969
they gave me an address...

06:45.013 --> 06:46.536
just off campus.

06:46.580 --> 06:49.670
Go, Ziva, find her.
Take McGee with you.

06:49.713 --> 06:51.846
We'll double-team her,
24/7, portal-to-portal.

06:54.283 --> 06:55.850
You got a problem, McGee?

06:55.893 --> 06:59.549
Well, Army CID
gets to protect

06:59.593 --> 07:01.638
the Defense Minister and the
other official delegates,

07:01.682 --> 07:03.205
NCIS gets his daughter?

07:03.248 --> 07:04.424
What do you want me to say?

07:11.909 --> 07:13.302
Growing up in Israel,

07:13.345 --> 07:16.566
my idea of American college life
was Animal Farm.

07:16.610 --> 07:18.438
The George Orwell book?

07:18.481 --> 07:20.178
[laughing] No!

07:20.222 --> 07:21.571
The John Belushi movie.

07:21.615 --> 07:23.660
That's Animal House.

07:23.704 --> 07:26.141
Whatever.
Did you go to toga parties?

07:26.184 --> 07:28.839
No, I didn't belong
to a fraternity.

07:28.883 --> 07:30.667
That's it.

07:30.711 --> 07:33.017
Hm. I definitely
did not live

07:33.061 --> 07:34.584
in a place
like that, either.

07:38.762 --> 07:39.415
ZIVA:
Is that her?

07:41.417 --> 07:42.897
I don't know.
You think?

07:42.940 --> 07:45.726
Six years in America
changes people.

07:45.769 --> 07:47.554
I guess.
Excuse me, Miss Gorgova?!

07:48.729 --> 07:50.470
Yes?

07:51.688 --> 07:54.822
Hi. NCIS Special Agents
McGee and David.

07:54.865 --> 07:56.476
I thought I made it clear

07:56.519 --> 07:58.782
to whomever called
from the embassy--

07:58.826 --> 08:00.175
I don't need protection.

08:00.218 --> 08:02.830
I'm fine. Okay?

08:02.873 --> 08:05.136
There was an attempt
on your father's life.

08:05.180 --> 08:07.312
I do not think
it is your choice.

08:07.356 --> 08:08.488
MAN:
Adriana!

08:10.228 --> 08:12.883
Sorry.
I got hung up at work.

08:12.927 --> 08:15.756
Give me a minute, Judd.

08:15.799 --> 08:18.062
Sure.

08:18.106 --> 08:23.154
I've lived here independently
and have enjoyed my privacy.

08:23.198 --> 08:25.853
My father's identity
is known to very few,

08:25.896 --> 08:27.376
and I intend
to keep it that way.

08:29.204 --> 08:31.598
Adriana, we're... we're
late for the study group.

08:31.641 --> 08:33.121
Everything okay?

08:33.164 --> 08:35.558
Yeah.

08:35.602 --> 08:39.170
Take your protection detail...
and shove it.

08:40.998 --> 08:42.652
Let's go, Judd.

08:44.915 --> 08:46.526
Wow.

08:54.403 --> 08:56.231
You will do as you're told,
you understand me?

08:56.274 --> 08:58.189
I am 24 years old

08:58.233 --> 09:01.018
and have been on my own
for six years.

09:01.062 --> 09:03.543
I don't need
to be chaperoned by anyone.

09:03.586 --> 09:05.327
You have not been
on your own.

09:05.370 --> 09:06.807
I have supported you.

09:06.850 --> 09:08.635
You are in this country
on student visa.

09:08.678 --> 09:09.766
It can be
revoked immediately.

09:14.815 --> 09:18.209
I am concerned
for your safety.

09:18.253 --> 09:18.862
Adriana!

09:23.650 --> 09:26.914
I apologize for
my daughter's behavior.

09:26.957 --> 09:31.353
You will see she's
very intelligent young lady.

09:31.396 --> 09:34.225
And reasonable!

09:34.269 --> 09:36.619
When she wants to be.

09:36.663 --> 09:38.839
We will watch
after her, sir.

09:38.882 --> 09:39.753
Thank you.

09:39.796 --> 09:41.842
I'll show you out.

09:49.893 --> 09:51.286
Okay.

09:51.329 --> 09:53.288
You can tag along,
if you want.

09:53.331 --> 09:56.030
But understand I am not
changing my routine for you.

09:56.073 --> 09:58.902
I've got classes, I am behind
on my dissertation,

09:58.946 --> 10:00.861
and I'm training
for the National Marathon

10:00.904 --> 10:02.906
next month.
We won't get
in your way.

10:05.082 --> 10:07.215
I have an appointment
for a facial...

10:07.258 --> 10:08.869
and Brazilian at 4:00.

10:10.305 --> 10:11.480
You coming?

10:18.269 --> 10:20.141
You're the State Department
Regional Security Officer

10:20.184 --> 10:22.491
in Belgravia;
you must know something.

10:22.534 --> 10:24.232
You have to understand.

10:24.275 --> 10:27.104
It's pro forma to allow
the local authorities

10:27.148 --> 10:29.280
the courtesy of conducting
the investigation.

10:29.324 --> 10:32.153
Well, you have to understand
NCIS investigates the death

10:32.196 --> 10:33.894
of every United States Marine.

10:33.937 --> 10:34.895
Yes, but...

10:34.938 --> 10:36.331
We've heard that the Belgravians

10:36.374 --> 10:38.333
suspect a local dissident group
was responsible.

10:38.376 --> 10:39.595
Correct.

10:39.639 --> 10:40.770
That is the current thinking.

10:40.814 --> 10:42.206
Based on what evidence?

10:42.250 --> 10:45.209
Based on the group
claiming responsibility.

10:45.253 --> 10:47.429
What, a phone call
to the media?

10:47.472 --> 10:50.388
The bomber has been identified
as a local.

10:50.432 --> 10:51.694
We're trying to tie him
to the group.

10:51.738 --> 10:54.218
Has anyone been arrested?

10:54.262 --> 10:55.611
No.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.831
It's midnight here.

10:57.874 --> 10:59.397
I still have a lot to do.

10:59.441 --> 11:00.616
When the treaty's signed
tomorrow in Washington

11:00.660 --> 11:02.009
it's going to hit the fan here.

11:02.052 --> 11:04.315
If I hear anything else,
I'll let you know.

11:08.537 --> 11:10.757
Let's secure Jennings' body
from AFIP in Dover,

11:10.800 --> 11:12.672
do our own autopsy.

11:12.715 --> 11:15.326
I told you that I would
take care of that.

11:15.370 --> 11:18.547
Your primary assignment right
now is the protection detail.

11:25.032 --> 11:26.250
Oh, no!

11:26.294 --> 11:27.425
No, no, no, no, no!

11:27.469 --> 11:28.731
What?

11:28.775 --> 11:29.863
My computer just crashed!

11:29.906 --> 11:31.821
Oh! I've lost everything!

11:31.865 --> 11:33.431
Damn it!

11:33.475 --> 11:36.478
Well, you know, it's really not
possible to lose everything.

11:36.521 --> 11:38.741
Mind if I take a look?

11:38.785 --> 11:40.743
Uh-uh. This paper's
too important.

11:40.787 --> 11:42.223
I need somebody that actually
knows what they're doing.

11:42.266 --> 11:43.572
[chuckles]

11:43.615 --> 11:45.269
Well, McGee's pretty
good with computers.

11:45.313 --> 11:47.881
Among his degrees,
he has a masters

11:47.924 --> 11:51.275
in computer forensics
from MIT.

11:51.319 --> 11:52.755
[intercom buzzes]

11:52.799 --> 11:54.235
That's someone in the lobby.

11:54.278 --> 11:55.802
Must be our replacements.

11:57.847 --> 11:59.675
Yes?

11:59.719 --> 12:01.459
Gibbs.Come on up.

12:01.503 --> 12:04.506
He sounds pleasant.

12:04.549 --> 12:05.768
That's our boss.

12:05.812 --> 12:07.683
A man of few words.

12:07.727 --> 12:11.165
To quote the agent that
will walk in here with him,
"A functional mute."

12:11.208 --> 12:13.689
I suggest you don't
mess with him too much.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.822
All right.
There we go.

12:15.865 --> 12:18.738
There is your file.[gasps, laughs]

12:18.781 --> 12:20.522
Auto-save was turned off,

12:20.565 --> 12:21.828
so I took the liberty

12:21.871 --> 12:25.005
of enabling it
every 60 seconds.

12:25.048 --> 12:26.441
Shouldn't have
that problem again.

12:26.484 --> 12:27.877
Thank you.

12:29.705 --> 12:31.620
What are your
other degrees in?

12:32.969 --> 12:34.318
[knocking on door]

12:46.069 --> 12:47.810
Close your mouth, Tony.

12:47.854 --> 12:50.987
Her radar's locked on McGee.

12:51.031 --> 12:53.033
Boss, there's only
the one entrance

12:53.076 --> 12:54.774
and no windows
that allow access.

12:56.950 --> 12:58.386
Special Agent Gibbs.

12:58.429 --> 13:00.301
Heard you're
the silent type.

13:00.344 --> 13:01.998
[wry laugh]

13:02.042 --> 13:03.957
See ya, boss.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.523
Thank you for
helping me, Timmy.

13:07.351 --> 13:09.136
You'll be back
in the morning?

13:09.179 --> 13:10.050
Yeah.

13:11.529 --> 13:13.401
Bye.

13:15.142 --> 13:17.448
And who are you?

13:20.016 --> 13:22.932
JIMMY:
Feels good to give blood.

13:22.976 --> 13:27.676
Yeah, well, for 3,000 years,
bloodletting or phlebotomy

13:27.719 --> 13:29.678
was considered therapeutic.

13:29.721 --> 13:33.943
The practice continued
till almost the end
of the 19th century.

13:33.987 --> 13:37.599
It all started, of course,
with the ancient Egyptians.

13:41.168 --> 13:44.214
Did you leave one
of our guests out

13:44.258 --> 13:46.303
last night, Mr. Palmer?

13:46.347 --> 13:48.262
No, Doc. It's me.

13:49.785 --> 13:52.309
Protection detail;
didn't get much sleep.

13:52.353 --> 13:54.007
And what brings you down here,

13:54.050 --> 13:56.531
other than a uncomfortable
stainless steel bed?

13:56.574 --> 13:57.488
Sergeant Jennings.

13:57.532 --> 13:59.490
Oh, yes.

13:59.534 --> 14:01.449
Pursuant to Director Vance's
instructions,

14:01.492 --> 14:03.451
I spoke with the Armed Forces
Institute of Pathology

14:03.494 --> 14:04.931
last night.

14:04.974 --> 14:08.108
They were going to e-mail me
the details of his arrival.

14:08.151 --> 14:09.892
I'll check on that,
Dr. Mallard.

14:09.936 --> 14:12.068
DUCKY:
My main concern is

14:12.112 --> 14:16.029
they embalmed the
body in Germany,

14:16.072 --> 14:19.423
and that could
impede my autopsy.

14:19.467 --> 14:21.164
My concern is you finding
enough trace evidence

14:21.208 --> 14:23.340
to I.D. the signature
of the bomb maker.

14:23.384 --> 14:25.952
Eh, sergeant's remains
are scheduled

14:25.995 --> 14:28.345
to arrive at Dover
at 0900 and...

14:28.389 --> 14:29.869
I had better leave.

14:29.912 --> 14:31.087
Traffic is a mess.

14:32.262 --> 14:34.308
Keep me posted, Duck.

14:34.351 --> 14:35.875
[elevator bell chimes]Hold that thing, Palmer.

14:45.275 --> 14:47.887
McGEE:
How long do you think
this is going to take?

14:47.930 --> 14:50.193
15, 20 minutes.

14:53.675 --> 14:54.937
Professor Fleming

14:54.981 --> 14:56.939
is one of the few
people on campus

14:56.983 --> 14:59.028
who know who
my father is.

14:59.072 --> 15:01.378
Do you have to come
in with me?

15:01.422 --> 15:03.032
I'm sure he
can be trusted.

15:03.076 --> 15:05.252
We just need
to check the room.

15:06.470 --> 15:07.384
[sighs]

15:09.082 --> 15:10.083
FLEMING:
Come in.

15:13.216 --> 15:14.435
Professor Fleming,

15:14.478 --> 15:18.482
mind if my keepers take
a look around?

15:18.526 --> 15:20.093
Nothing to hide here.
Come on in.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.924
Thanks.
Just take a second.

15:42.245 --> 15:43.551
McGee.

15:44.813 --> 15:45.683
Sorry.

15:47.076 --> 15:48.686
You texting him?

15:48.730 --> 15:50.558
Ray? Yes.

15:50.601 --> 15:53.561
He wanted to know
what I was doing.

15:53.604 --> 15:55.693
And you can't tell him
anything about it.

15:55.737 --> 15:58.348
How long do you think
we're going to be together?

15:58.392 --> 16:00.785
You and Ray?
No, us--

16:00.829 --> 16:02.396
Gibbs's team.

16:02.439 --> 16:05.573
I mean, you've been here seven
years, Tony's been here longer.

16:05.616 --> 16:08.010
I do think about that
myself sometimes.

16:11.622 --> 16:16.236
Tony turned down a post
in Spain four years ago.

16:16.279 --> 16:19.195
Career-wise, he can't
do that again.

16:19.239 --> 16:21.371
Do you think you'd want
to lead your own team?

16:23.199 --> 16:25.114
Yeah.

16:25.158 --> 16:27.421
Yeah, someday, sure.

16:29.423 --> 16:30.728
Adriana still in there?

16:30.772 --> 16:31.642
Yes.

16:33.122 --> 16:34.341
You guys are, uh...

16:34.384 --> 16:35.559
Friends.

16:46.179 --> 16:48.355
You're in Adriana's
study group, right?

16:48.398 --> 16:50.226
Mm-hmm.
I heard you say

16:50.270 --> 16:52.533
you also work?Sort of.

16:52.576 --> 16:54.404
I do odd jobs
for a small machine shop

16:54.448 --> 16:56.015
in exchange for
a place to live.

16:58.321 --> 17:00.410
I will do the revisions and get
them back to you by Friday.

17:00.454 --> 17:01.846
So long as I have them

17:01.890 --> 17:03.674
by the weekend.

17:05.502 --> 17:07.809
Next patient.
You ready, Judd?

17:07.852 --> 17:09.028
Movie tonight?

17:09.071 --> 17:11.726
Can't.

17:21.649 --> 17:23.303
Not funny.

17:23.346 --> 17:25.305
Are you here to scold me?

17:25.348 --> 17:27.176
Yes. And not about that.

17:29.570 --> 17:31.659
Tony, you skipped
the blood drive again.

17:31.702 --> 17:33.313
You're the only one
on Team Gibbs

17:33.356 --> 17:35.141
that hasn't donated.

17:35.184 --> 17:37.534
I was up all night guarding
the Belgravian brat, you know.

17:37.578 --> 17:38.753
I only got a couple
hours of sleep.

17:38.796 --> 17:40.233
Now I gotta go and
I gotta relieve Ziva.

17:40.276 --> 17:42.626
I'm a busy guy, Abbs.

17:42.670 --> 17:44.367
I'll do it tomorrow,
I promise.

17:44.411 --> 17:46.108
Tomorrow morning.

17:46.152 --> 17:47.283
What?

17:47.327 --> 17:49.024
I don't understand.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.331
You donated your sperm
when you were in college.

17:51.374 --> 17:53.376
Yes, it's a much more
pleasurable delivery system.

17:55.161 --> 17:56.858
Tony, what is wrong?

17:56.901 --> 17:58.468
Nothing.

17:58.512 --> 18:00.949
[sniffs]

18:00.992 --> 18:03.299
Tony...

18:03.343 --> 18:05.649
Ever since I was
in the hospital...

18:08.043 --> 18:10.524
I've been terrified
by needles.

18:13.788 --> 18:15.137
I gotta go.

18:20.316 --> 18:24.103
So are you going to spend
any time with your father
before he leaves?

18:24.146 --> 18:25.974
I doubt it.

18:26.017 --> 18:28.977
I don't think there's any time
for me on his schedule.

18:29.020 --> 18:31.806
Gather you two are
not very close, huh?

18:35.070 --> 18:38.334
We were, when I was younger.

18:38.378 --> 18:41.903
But things changed.

18:41.946 --> 18:43.426
When he got
into politics.

18:43.470 --> 18:45.298
Yeah.

18:45.341 --> 18:49.215
I, too, have, um...

18:49.258 --> 18:53.958
a father whose first
love is his country.

18:54.002 --> 18:57.919
Are his politics as
misguided as my father's?

18:57.962 --> 18:59.573
TONY:
Don't get me started

18:59.616 --> 19:01.705
on fathers.

19:01.749 --> 19:04.186
Are you going to change?

19:04.230 --> 19:06.275
Um, no.

19:06.319 --> 19:07.494
Agents DiNozzo and McGee

19:07.537 --> 19:08.712
are going to run with you.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.194
What's with McGee?

19:12.238 --> 19:13.369
[chuckles]

19:13.413 --> 19:14.501
What do you mean?

19:14.544 --> 19:17.721
Is there a Mrs. McGee?

19:17.765 --> 19:19.897
[laughing]:
What a concept.

19:21.377 --> 19:23.379
No, he's not married.

19:23.423 --> 19:24.424
Girlfriend?

19:24.467 --> 19:26.643
Not that I know of.

19:26.687 --> 19:28.210
TONY: Okay, what am I
missing here, huh?

19:28.254 --> 19:30.691
We talking about the same guy--
Timothy McGee?

19:30.734 --> 19:33.433
The Ichabod Crane who
speaks in algorithms

19:33.476 --> 19:36.218
and looks like he has some kind
of permanently frumpy expression

19:36.262 --> 19:37.915
on his face?

19:37.959 --> 19:39.526
Do not listen to him, Adriana.

19:39.569 --> 19:41.397
McGee is a very sweet man.

19:41.441 --> 19:42.485
He is intelligent

19:42.529 --> 19:45.532
and he is loyal
to a fault.

19:48.622 --> 19:51.538
We are talking
about a different guy.

19:51.581 --> 19:54.671
JIMMY:
I cannot believe how many pieces
of shrapnel his body absorbed.

19:54.715 --> 19:57.239
Not exactly shrapnel.

19:57.283 --> 19:59.807
They're called flechettes.

19:59.850 --> 20:03.376
The reports shows that
Sergeant Jennings

20:03.419 --> 20:08.598
was less than three meters away
when the bomb detonated.

20:08.642 --> 20:12.994
His action saved the life
of the defense minister
and countless others.

20:13.037 --> 20:15.779
I will never understand
fanatics who are willing
to give up their lives

20:15.823 --> 20:17.433
just to make
a political statement.

20:17.477 --> 20:19.130
It's nothing new.

20:19.174 --> 20:21.307
Suicide bombing as
a political tool--

20:21.350 --> 20:23.918
well, it can be traced back
to the assassination

20:23.961 --> 20:27.835
of Czar Alexander II
of Russia, in 1881.

20:27.878 --> 20:31.708
Alexander fell victim
to a nihilist plot,

20:31.752 --> 20:34.015
while driving on one
of the central streets

20:34.058 --> 20:36.365
of St. Petersburg,
near the Winter Palace.

20:36.409 --> 20:38.193
You know, Abby's
already called me twice.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.803
I think she's pretty anxious
to get these samples.

20:39.847 --> 20:40.891
You are dismissed.

20:40.935 --> 20:42.545
Thank you so much.

20:44.068 --> 20:47.202
History lesson to continue
on his return.

20:51.337 --> 20:53.600
You should think of running
in the marathon next month, Tim.

20:53.643 --> 20:55.776
I train with a group
on the weekends.

20:55.819 --> 20:56.951
Why don't you join us?

20:58.605 --> 21:00.171
I'll, uh, I'll
think about it. Yeah.

21:00.215 --> 21:01.825
Good.

21:01.869 --> 21:05.264
You know, I ran the Boston
Marathon back in '95.

21:05.307 --> 21:06.787
You didn't do
so bad,

21:06.830 --> 21:09.137
for a guy your age.[chuckles]

21:09.180 --> 21:11.966
Anyone else hungry?
Yeah.

21:12.009 --> 21:14.316
There's a great bistro
by my house.

21:14.360 --> 21:16.318
They make the best
mixta salad.

21:16.362 --> 21:17.537
Okay, okay, by me.

21:17.580 --> 21:18.581
Let's earn it.

21:18.625 --> 21:20.453
Up the stairs.

21:25.893 --> 21:27.851
Tony, why don't you
pick up the salads.

21:27.895 --> 21:29.418
The walk will cool you down.

21:29.462 --> 21:32.334
Wouldn't want you
to cramp up.

21:32.378 --> 21:34.293
I'm going to take a shower.

21:35.772 --> 21:38.035
Behave yourself.
You're on duty.

21:49.525 --> 21:50.831
[door closes
in distance]

21:59.666 --> 22:02.190
ADRIANA:
Tim! I need your help.

22:03.496 --> 22:05.062
You decent?

22:05.106 --> 22:07.717
You'll find out
when you get here.

22:11.155 --> 22:13.070
[quietly]:
This is not a good idea.

22:13.114 --> 22:14.289
Tim!

22:14.333 --> 22:15.899
Yeah.

22:15.943 --> 22:19.468
[Adriana grunts]

22:19.512 --> 22:20.556
[sighs]

22:20.600 --> 22:23.429
I flipped a switch
and the bulb popped.

22:23.472 --> 22:25.126
[Adriana sighs]

22:30.131 --> 22:33.743
I can't, uh,
shower in the dark.

22:35.484 --> 22:38.139
Do you have
a stepladder?

22:39.532 --> 22:41.098
In the closet.

22:42.099 --> 22:45.059
Wait.

22:45.102 --> 22:46.234
We can't do this.

22:50.847 --> 22:52.196
I'm going to go
get the ladder.

23:00.857 --> 23:05.558
I'm sorry I fought
having you around.

23:05.601 --> 23:07.560
What, me, or an NCIS
protection detail?

23:10.214 --> 23:11.825
I've got some spare bulbs
in the kitchen.

23:26.622 --> 23:29.364
[knocking on door]

23:29.408 --> 23:30.321
ADRIANA:
Huh.

23:30.365 --> 23:32.846
Tony must've
forgotten something.

23:32.889 --> 23:34.500
[knocking on door]

23:34.543 --> 23:36.502
I'll get it!

23:36.545 --> 23:38.939
No!

23:40.419 --> 23:41.898
McGEE:
Adriana!

23:41.942 --> 23:43.073
KIDNAPPER:
Don't do it.

23:43.117 --> 23:44.597
Stay back. She's ours.

23:45.989 --> 23:47.861
[door slams]

23:49.689 --> 23:52.605
[phone ringing]

23:52.648 --> 23:54.215
What?

23:54.258 --> 23:55.259
McGEE:
Tony, Adriana's been kidnapped.

23:55.303 --> 23:56.391
Two armed men with masks.

23:56.435 --> 23:57.566
What?!

23:57.610 --> 23:59.263
[engine roaring]

23:59.307 --> 24:00.961
[tires squealing]

24:03.964 --> 24:05.792
Do you see them?

24:05.835 --> 24:07.489
They're heading north!

24:07.533 --> 24:09.926
Come on.

24:09.970 --> 24:12.189
[engine revs,
tires screech]

24:12.755 --> 24:13.669
Out of the way!

24:13.713 --> 24:14.975
[woman screams]

24:34.603 --> 24:36.692
VANCE: This is an FBI
crime scene now.

24:36.736 --> 24:39.260
If this isn't
rectified in 48 hours,

24:39.303 --> 24:43.133
I want DiNozzo and McGee's
badges on my desk.

24:43.177 --> 24:44.918
Does Gorgova know?

24:44.961 --> 24:48.704
His embassy's been notified
by the kidnappers already.

24:48.748 --> 24:50.227
They threatened to
kill his daughter

24:50.271 --> 24:51.620
if he signs that treaty.

24:51.664 --> 24:54.536
Ceremony's been put on hold.

24:54.580 --> 24:55.755
This couldn't have
come at a worse time.

25:10.596 --> 25:12.293
Boss...

25:12.336 --> 25:15.339
this is all
my fault.

25:15.383 --> 25:18.691
I take responsibility
for what happened here.

25:18.734 --> 25:20.693
You'll have my resignation
by the end of the day.

25:20.736 --> 25:23.696
Did you break
protocol, McGee?

25:23.739 --> 25:24.784
No, but...

25:24.827 --> 25:27.395
I'm responsible.

25:27.438 --> 25:30.398
You are part of a team;
you're part of my team,

25:30.441 --> 25:33.836
and I'm sure as hell
not turning in my badge!

25:36.317 --> 25:38.319
FBI's here.

25:38.362 --> 25:39.712
All right.
There's work to be done.

25:39.755 --> 25:41.627
Both of you witnessed
the kidnapping.

25:41.670 --> 25:42.671
You cooperate.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.066
And when they are done with you,

25:46.109 --> 25:47.502
you get your butts
back to the Navy Yard.

25:49.765 --> 25:54.161
Wow. Guess Agent of the Year's
out of the question.

25:54.204 --> 25:56.076
[Abby chanting in Chinese]

26:01.429 --> 26:03.039
Abbs, what are you doing?

26:03.083 --> 26:07.087
Well, it's an ancient Chinese
chant to remove bad luck.

26:07.130 --> 26:08.610
What are you burning?

26:08.654 --> 26:11.874
Um, Tan Xiang.
It's a Tan incense.

26:11.918 --> 26:14.355
That DiNozzo's stapler?
Yes.

26:14.398 --> 26:17.053
And that's McGee's book.

26:17.097 --> 26:19.229
Do you really think
Director Vance would

26:19.273 --> 26:20.622
make them resign?

26:20.666 --> 26:23.146
Oh, yeah, he would.

26:23.190 --> 26:25.758
[chanting in Chinese]

26:25.801 --> 26:28.587
Abbs, you really
want to help them--

26:28.630 --> 26:31.415
stop chanting and
focus on the work.

26:32.982 --> 26:35.202
Why am I here?

26:35.245 --> 26:36.682
I analyzed the bomb fragments

26:36.725 --> 26:38.771
that Ducky pulled from
Sergeant Jennings' body.

26:38.814 --> 26:41.208
The internal payload was
a shell, filled with

26:41.251 --> 26:44.646
thousands of these teeny-weeny
little needle-like thingies.

26:44.690 --> 26:46.300
Yeah. Flechettes.
Ducky told me.

26:46.343 --> 26:48.302
They're made out of a
unique titanium alloy,

26:48.345 --> 26:51.392
It has a very high
melting point--

26:51.435 --> 26:54.134
1,900 degrees Kelvin,
or 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit.

26:54.177 --> 26:55.657
That it?

26:55.701 --> 26:58.225
I wouldn't call you
down here just for that.

26:58.268 --> 27:00.488
Remember how the Unabomber's
signature was wood?

27:00.531 --> 27:03.143
Mm-hmm.
Well, this alloy

27:03.186 --> 27:04.710
plus that marking
on the flechette,

27:04.753 --> 27:05.972
is the signature of

27:06.015 --> 27:07.800
another U.S. bomb maker.

27:07.843 --> 27:10.672
He's been linked
to protest bombings

27:10.716 --> 27:12.369
on the campus of
Texas Western University,

27:12.413 --> 27:15.503
and U.S. bases at Subic Bay
and the Vieques Islands.

27:15.546 --> 27:17.984
Does the bomb maker have a name?

27:18.027 --> 27:20.421
[Abby typing rapidly,
computer blipping]

27:20.464 --> 27:21.422
Joe Don Wynn.

27:21.465 --> 27:22.597
[kisses]

27:22.641 --> 27:23.642
Wait!

27:23.685 --> 27:25.208
I know where he is.

27:25.252 --> 27:27.820
ATF busted him two weeks ago.

27:27.863 --> 27:28.995
[elevator bell chimes,
doors slide open]

27:29.038 --> 27:30.605
[footsteps approaching]

27:41.660 --> 27:42.922
Aah!

27:42.965 --> 27:45.402
Bad day just got worse.
Where's my stapler?

27:45.446 --> 27:47.013
Tony, I didn't take it.

27:47.056 --> 27:48.754
This time.

27:50.756 --> 27:52.671
Don't look at me!

27:52.714 --> 27:54.585
How'd it go at the Bureau?

27:54.629 --> 27:56.109
Well, they kept us
there last night and

27:56.152 --> 27:58.720
most of this morning,

27:58.764 --> 28:01.157
which means that we've gone two
nights without having any sleep.

28:01.201 --> 28:02.681
They found the kidnappers' car

28:02.724 --> 28:04.334
less than a mile from
Adriana's apartment.

28:04.378 --> 28:06.989
It was reported stolen
two days ago.

28:07.033 --> 28:08.512
Car was clean,
no prints.

28:08.556 --> 28:11.733
Their, uh, forensics
came up empty.

28:11.777 --> 28:14.910
ZIVA: Do you know
why Abby sent this to me?

28:14.954 --> 28:16.912
GIBBS: He made the bomb
that killed Sergeant Jennings.

28:16.956 --> 28:18.697
ZIVA:
Joe Don Wynn.

28:18.740 --> 28:19.915
An American.

28:19.959 --> 28:22.048
How did an American bomb
end up in Belgravia?

28:22.091 --> 28:23.745
We have Homeland Security here.

28:23.789 --> 28:25.573
They have nothing
like that in Belgravia.

28:25.616 --> 28:28.402
Wynn's being brought here
from Central Detention.

28:28.445 --> 28:31.405
You think the same people who
tried to assassinate Gorgova

28:31.448 --> 28:32.798
kidnapped his daughter?

28:36.018 --> 28:38.542
Boss, is there something
we should be doing?

28:41.545 --> 28:44.157
By now, the FBI's finished
processing Adriana's apartment.

28:46.246 --> 28:47.856
Wonder if they missed anything.

28:52.382 --> 28:55.255
Campfire.

28:58.301 --> 29:01.609
What does he mean?

29:01.652 --> 29:05.874
Is he suggesting
what I think he was?

29:05.918 --> 29:07.484
That would be
a very bold move.

29:07.528 --> 29:09.399
I like it.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.063
It was like a geyser,

29:21.107 --> 29:22.586
just shooting straight
up in the air.

29:22.630 --> 29:24.893
That was a...
Good job, guys.

29:26.852 --> 29:29.158
Look, even if we can pick
the lock, we can't go in there.

29:29.202 --> 29:30.551
Chill, McFraidy.

29:30.594 --> 29:32.161
I mean, what's the
worst they can do to us?

29:32.205 --> 29:33.728
They're already going
to take our badges.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.904
They can arrest us for
tampering with a crime scene.

29:35.948 --> 29:37.297
I'm sure there's
an FBI seal on the door.

29:37.340 --> 29:38.515
We cannot break it.

29:38.559 --> 29:41.257
TONY:
[chuckles] No problemo.

29:41.301 --> 29:42.824
Metro PD, ATF...

29:42.868 --> 29:45.218
Oh, yeah-- FBI.

29:45.261 --> 29:46.480
Knew this would
come in handy.

29:46.523 --> 29:48.090
McGEE:
Where did you get that?

29:48.134 --> 29:49.700
Remember that joint crime scene
we worked with Fornell--

29:49.744 --> 29:51.746
boarding house,
downtown.
Yes.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.530
One of his guys left
this laying around.

29:53.574 --> 29:55.532
Very sloppy.

29:55.576 --> 29:57.317
It'll be like
we were never here.

30:00.320 --> 30:04.150
We are so screwed.

30:04.193 --> 30:07.022
So why would I
tell you anything?

30:07.066 --> 30:08.545
Well, because
I can help you.

30:10.069 --> 30:12.593
Yeah? How?

30:12.636 --> 30:17.119
I've seen the
prosecution's file.

30:17.163 --> 30:19.861
Let me give you
a little preview

30:19.905 --> 30:23.473
how your trial's
going to go.

30:23.517 --> 30:25.867
Texas Western,
Subic Bay bombings...

30:25.911 --> 30:27.434
They got a strong
case against you.

30:27.477 --> 30:33.005
Vieques Islands...
that one's a slam dunk.

30:33.048 --> 30:35.485
You're, uh...

30:35.529 --> 30:38.880
you're being represented by
a 26-year-old public defender?

30:38.924 --> 30:40.839
Yeah.

30:44.581 --> 30:47.280
Trial's a waste of
the taxpayer's money.

30:47.323 --> 30:49.195
You're toast.

30:52.111 --> 30:54.722
So what can you do for me?

30:54.765 --> 30:58.334
Ah, a case like yours
is all about sentencing.

31:00.293 --> 31:02.512
You help me...

31:02.556 --> 31:04.906
I could talk
to the judge.

31:04.950 --> 31:07.866
What do you want?

31:10.042 --> 31:12.218
Last week, there was an
assassination attempt

31:12.261 --> 31:14.873
in Belgravia and
we can link you

31:14.916 --> 31:17.919
to the bomb.

31:17.963 --> 31:19.529
I don't know what
you're talking about.

31:19.573 --> 31:21.531
Okay, you want to play
games, I'm out of here.

31:21.575 --> 31:22.489
Wait-- hey, hey.
Hey, hey.

31:24.404 --> 31:25.622
All right.

31:28.756 --> 31:30.323
Who'd you make the bomb for?

31:30.366 --> 31:33.152
You can talk to the judge.

31:33.195 --> 31:36.329
You tell him I helped you,
I can get a deal?

31:36.372 --> 31:38.157
I seen it before.

31:40.637 --> 31:42.030
All right.

31:42.074 --> 31:43.553
This guy approached me
a few months ago.

31:43.597 --> 31:45.120
This guy Belgravian?

31:45.164 --> 31:47.122
No. He was American.

31:47.166 --> 31:48.558
He paid me in cash.

31:48.602 --> 31:50.517
What's his name?

31:50.560 --> 31:52.258
[laughs]

31:52.301 --> 31:54.347
I don't know who this guy
thought he was dealing with.

31:54.390 --> 31:56.958
He gave me a fake one
but I checked him out.

31:57.002 --> 31:58.133
He's a teacher
at John Hamilton.

31:58.177 --> 31:59.743
He's a professor.

31:59.787 --> 32:01.702
His real name
is Carl Fleming.

32:03.878 --> 32:05.401
So you going to talk
to the judge, right?

32:05.445 --> 32:06.968
No.
What?

32:07.012 --> 32:08.622
You said you would.I said I could.

32:08.665 --> 32:11.712
But I won't.

32:11.755 --> 32:13.496
You built a bomb
that killed a U.S. Marine.

32:17.283 --> 32:19.459
ZIVA: We don't even know
what we're looking for.

32:19.502 --> 32:20.547
TONY:
We're truffle-huntin'.

32:20.590 --> 32:22.157
We're just sniffing around.

32:22.201 --> 32:26.161
[groans]
That's gonna leave a scar.

32:26.205 --> 32:28.076
It'll give you
some character.

32:29.817 --> 32:31.688
I got something.

32:41.263 --> 32:44.092
Something was jammed in there.

32:44.136 --> 32:45.964
Tripped the bathroom's
ground-fault circuit breaker.

32:48.096 --> 32:50.707
I got changed in here
before we went running.

32:50.751 --> 32:52.579
Lights were working then.

32:52.622 --> 32:53.928
Who popped the breaker?

32:53.972 --> 32:55.712
The only other
person that went in

32:55.756 --> 32:56.670
the bathroom
was Adriana.

32:59.847 --> 33:02.110
Maybe she got you in here
as a diversion

33:02.154 --> 33:03.851
so she could open
the door.

33:03.894 --> 33:06.549
What are you saying, she was
in on her own kidnapping?

33:06.593 --> 33:08.899
How would she know
exactly when

33:08.943 --> 33:10.423
the kidnappers would come?

33:10.466 --> 33:12.991
She signaled them.

33:13.034 --> 33:14.122
How, Tony?

33:14.166 --> 33:15.732
She never left the bathroom.

33:15.776 --> 33:19.519
Godfather I:Michael Corleone
offs Captain McCluskey.

33:19.562 --> 33:21.782
She hid a gun
in the toilet?

33:21.825 --> 33:25.438
No, a cell phone.

33:31.792 --> 33:33.968
TONY: Carl Fleming has
Belgravian ancestry

33:34.012 --> 33:35.535
and a history of arrests

33:35.578 --> 33:38.103
for political
and anti-military protests.

33:38.146 --> 33:40.714
He's a clichÃ©;
the radical academic.

33:40.757 --> 33:43.673
Customs records show he just
returned from a European trip,

33:43.717 --> 33:46.067
including a stopover in
Belgravia.

33:46.111 --> 33:47.895
And Fleming's tied
to both cases.

33:47.938 --> 33:50.463
So he attempted
to assassinate Gorgova

33:50.506 --> 33:52.552
to stop the signing
of the treaty.

33:52.595 --> 33:54.336
Maybe when he failed,
he kidnapped the daughter.

33:54.380 --> 33:55.990
With her cooperation.

33:56.034 --> 33:58.340
Adriana told us she hates
her father's politics.

33:58.384 --> 33:59.689
Kidnapping's a hoax.

33:59.733 --> 34:01.909
McGEE: Boss, I've tracked
Fleming's cell phone

34:01.952 --> 34:03.998
to the 300 block of 14th Street.

34:04.042 --> 34:06.870
Could be where
he's hiding with Adriana.

34:20.362 --> 34:24.149
[scanner beeping]

34:24.192 --> 34:28.109
It says the signal was coming
from within 25 feet of here.

34:28.153 --> 34:29.328
GIBBS:
Ziva, check it out.

34:29.371 --> 34:31.286
Mm-hmm.

34:35.595 --> 34:38.902
TONY:
"John Hamilton faculty parking."

34:38.946 --> 34:41.557
ZIVA: Could be inside
one of these buildings.

34:49.174 --> 34:50.479
Boss...

34:51.872 --> 34:54.701
No cell phone. Look at this.

34:58.270 --> 35:00.881
DiNozzo, pop the trunk.

35:11.500 --> 35:13.372
Didn't expect that.

35:16.723 --> 35:18.725
If Fleming was behind
the assassination attempt

35:18.768 --> 35:21.771
and the kidnapping,
why's he dead?

35:21.815 --> 35:23.817
Where's Adriana?

35:32.217 --> 35:36.046
So it was really just
a, just a lucky thing.

35:36.090 --> 35:37.961
JIMMY: The FBI agents
appear to be upset.

35:38.005 --> 35:40.225
DUCKY: From what
I understand,

35:40.268 --> 35:41.704
it's a complicated
situation.

35:41.748 --> 35:45.273
Mm. Are McGee and Tony still on
double-secret probation?

35:45.317 --> 35:46.709
We're pathologists,
Mr. Palmer.

35:46.753 --> 35:49.451
We deal in bodies,
not gossip.

35:49.495 --> 35:52.019
We searched the area.

35:52.062 --> 35:53.151
Went door-to-door
with Metro PD.

35:53.194 --> 35:54.326
[phone ringing]No trace of Adriana.

35:54.369 --> 35:56.806
They're gonna keep
looking.
Yeah, Gibbs.

36:00.245 --> 36:02.725
I think we made the FBI's
Ten Most Wanted List.

36:02.769 --> 36:04.336
We were doing our job.

36:04.379 --> 36:06.164
We were investigating
Jennings' death,

36:06.207 --> 36:08.122
and that led us to finding
Fleming's body.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.516
I don't think they
see it that way.

36:10.559 --> 36:13.127
The embassy just received
a ransom demand for $10 million.

36:13.171 --> 36:16.130
This isn't about
politics anymore.

36:16.174 --> 36:18.828
Someone else is calling
the shots.

36:18.872 --> 36:20.700
The dead man's name
is Carl Fleming.

36:20.743 --> 36:23.398
He's an American.

36:23.442 --> 36:25.922
He teaches diplomatic
studies at John Hamilton.

36:25.966 --> 36:29.709
Minister Gorgova, he's your
daughter's faculty advisor.

36:29.752 --> 36:31.493
We suspect that Adriana

36:31.537 --> 36:33.191
was involved
in her own kidnapping.

36:34.235 --> 36:38.674
No. When it was political,

36:38.718 --> 36:41.982
about the treaty, I could agree
with you, Agent Gibbs,

36:42.025 --> 36:44.811
but Adriana had a substantial
trust fund.

36:44.854 --> 36:47.422
She had no need for money.

36:47.466 --> 36:48.684
[phone buzzing]

36:48.728 --> 36:49.598
It's my wife.

36:49.642 --> 36:50.599
Excuse me.

36:53.472 --> 36:55.996
The abduction started out
about the treaty.

36:56.039 --> 36:57.606
We think that there was
a falling out.

36:57.650 --> 36:58.999
Now it is about money.

36:59.042 --> 37:01.131
This has gotten very messy.

37:01.175 --> 37:03.177
Director Vance,
for your sake, I hope

37:03.221 --> 37:04.700
you're not just covering
for your agents' screw-up.

37:04.744 --> 37:07.268
That is not the case.

37:07.312 --> 37:08.965
Keep your people out of this.

37:09.009 --> 37:11.664
Let the FBI find the girl.

37:18.148 --> 37:19.976
Gentlemen, will you
excuse us, please?

37:20.020 --> 37:21.239
Yes, Director.

37:27.027 --> 37:30.204
Nothing ever changes,
does it, Gibbs?

37:30.248 --> 37:32.728
Rules just don't apply
to you, do they?

37:32.772 --> 37:34.556
We were doing our job.

37:34.600 --> 37:37.080
Yeah. When were you gonna
tell me about the daughter?

37:37.124 --> 37:41.171
Why'd you assume we screwed up?

37:41.215 --> 37:45.175
The girl was in on
her own kidnapping, Leon.

37:45.219 --> 37:46.960
It couldn't have been prevented
by anyone.

37:47.003 --> 37:47.787
That's your theory, Gibbs.

37:47.830 --> 37:48.918
Do you have any proof?!

37:53.009 --> 37:54.097
Come on, come on,
come on!

37:54.141 --> 37:56.317
I'm going as fast
as I can here.

37:56.361 --> 37:57.536
I already called Gibbs!

37:57.579 --> 37:58.841
Well, you shouldn't have.

37:58.885 --> 37:59.625
[elevator bell chimes]

37:59.668 --> 38:00.974
I'll stall him.

38:01.017 --> 38:03.324
Hey, Gibbs!
Hey.

38:03.368 --> 38:05.326
You got down here
really, really fast.

38:05.370 --> 38:06.762
Well, yeah, you said
you had something, Abbs.

38:06.806 --> 38:08.851
Yep, right.

38:08.895 --> 38:10.505
Um, rice.

38:10.549 --> 38:12.812
Long-grain rice.

38:12.855 --> 38:14.727
You should know this.

38:14.770 --> 38:16.642
If you ever get
your cell phone wet,

38:16.685 --> 38:18.905
disconnect the battery
and then put the phone

38:18.948 --> 38:20.602
into a bowl
of uncooked rice.

38:20.646 --> 38:22.735
It acts as a drying agent,

38:22.778 --> 38:25.390
and it extracts the moisture
from the electronics.

38:25.433 --> 38:28.044
That what you did
to the phone found
in Adriana's apartment?

38:28.088 --> 38:29.785
Yep.
And?

38:29.829 --> 38:33.267
And we were able
to reconstruct its history.

38:33.311 --> 38:35.791
She sent a text message
at 2:48.

38:35.835 --> 38:39.055
That's, like, less than a minute
before she was kidnapped,

38:39.099 --> 38:41.449
and it was only
one word: "Now."

38:41.493 --> 38:43.843
Abbs, do we know
who she texted?

38:43.886 --> 38:44.931
Um...

38:46.193 --> 38:48.369
Well, um...

38:48.413 --> 38:50.328
McGee, do we know who
she texted?

38:51.633 --> 38:52.417
We do.

38:54.854 --> 38:56.508
The cell phone's registered
to Judd Stern.

38:56.551 --> 38:58.118
Ziva and I met him, boss.

38:58.161 --> 39:00.642
He's part
of Adriana's study group.

39:00.686 --> 39:02.949
Lives in an industrial
area off campus.

39:08.955 --> 39:11.218
I'm actually a good cook.

39:17.790 --> 39:19.705
I remove your gag...

39:19.748 --> 39:21.663
you don't yell?

39:26.146 --> 39:27.365
ALL:
Federal Agents!

39:30.193 --> 39:33.327
Federal agents! Freeze!

39:35.373 --> 39:36.374
He's on the move!

39:41.466 --> 39:42.249
Hey!

39:44.382 --> 39:45.731
Get down.

39:54.348 --> 39:55.305
On your knees.

40:01.921 --> 40:03.705
You okay?

40:03.749 --> 40:05.011
Yeah.

40:07.361 --> 40:08.797
We know you were involved.

40:10.233 --> 40:12.366
I never meant for
this to happen.

40:12.410 --> 40:15.935
I just wanted to stop my father
from signing the treaty.

40:17.763 --> 40:19.939
But Judd got greedy.

40:19.982 --> 40:21.897
He told me Professor Fleming
was gonna try

40:21.941 --> 40:22.985
to assassinate my father.

40:25.031 --> 40:27.686
Where is the professor?

40:29.427 --> 40:31.124
He's dead.

40:38.566 --> 40:41.047
Defense treaty was just signed.

40:41.090 --> 40:45.486
Gorgova and his party are
departing Andrews at 1345.

40:45.530 --> 40:46.618
Adriana with him?

40:46.661 --> 40:48.576
Mm-hmm.

40:48.620 --> 40:50.709
Wait. So she cooperates
in her own kidnapping

40:50.752 --> 40:51.927
and then gets off
Scotch free?

40:51.971 --> 40:52.972
Scot.

40:53.015 --> 40:55.670
Diplomatic immunity.

40:55.714 --> 40:57.629
What'd I miss?

40:57.672 --> 40:59.718
I mean, you think she was really
into me or was it

40:59.761 --> 41:01.023
just part of an act?

41:01.067 --> 41:02.024
[phone ringing]

41:02.068 --> 41:04.984
Ziva, get the phone.

41:11.860 --> 41:14.646
[sweetly]:
Special Agent DiNozzo's desk.

41:14.689 --> 41:17.213
[normal voice]:
Oh, okay. I'll tell him, Abby.

41:17.257 --> 41:18.345
Get off my phone.

41:18.388 --> 41:19.738
Tell me what?

41:19.781 --> 41:23.045
Abby is on her way up
with the Red Cross nurse.

41:23.089 --> 41:24.612
[gasps]
Uh, boss, I forgot--

41:24.656 --> 41:26.614
I got this dentist
appointment.

41:26.658 --> 41:27.876
Also I have to validate
my new parking I.D.

41:27.920 --> 41:29.225
ABBY:
Tony?

41:31.576 --> 41:33.969
I want you
to meet Samantha.

41:34.013 --> 41:35.710
Hi, Tony.

41:35.754 --> 41:37.146
Hi.

41:37.190 --> 41:41.063
Samantha's specialty is working
with people like you

41:41.107 --> 41:42.935
that suffer from
trypanophobia.

41:42.978 --> 41:44.458
The fear of needles.

41:44.502 --> 41:48.070
If you want to give blood,
I'd like to try to help you.

41:50.029 --> 41:51.987
Yeah, okay.

41:52.031 --> 41:53.206
Try away.

41:53.249 --> 41:55.121
It's not so much a fear,
actually.

41:55.164 --> 41:57.384
I had an incident
a few years ago.

41:57.427 --> 41:59.865
where I had bubonic,
or pneumonic plague.

41:59.908 --> 42:01.606
It was never
really diagnosed...
