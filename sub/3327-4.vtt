WEBVTT

00:02.070 --> 00:04.368
(indistinct conversations)

00:07.300 --> 00:09.734
Hey, all I did was give you
some fresh eyes.

00:09.770 --> 00:11.567
Ms. Watson.

00:11.610 --> 00:13.635
I didn't know you and Holmes
were stopping by.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.272
He's not here, just me.

00:15.310 --> 00:16.641
Everything okay?

00:16.680 --> 00:19.376
Uh, could we talk privately?

00:19.420 --> 00:21.411
I haven't heard from him
in over three hours.

00:21.450 --> 00:22.712
He's not responding to texts,

00:22.750 --> 00:24.581
he's not answering his phone.

00:24.620 --> 00:27.612
All due respect, but you know
your boss is a weirdo, right?

00:27.660 --> 00:31.221
He's probably out trying
to find Jimmy Hoffa

00:31.260 --> 00:32.796
in some, uh, subway tunnel.

00:32.830 --> 00:35.253
You don't understand.
We have an arrangement.

00:35.300 --> 00:37.165
We're not supposed to be apart
for more than two hours,

00:37.200 --> 00:38.792
and he's never
supposed to be unreachable.

00:38.830 --> 00:41.264
I know you two are pretty close
for an assistant and a boss,

00:41.300 --> 00:42.699
but how is that even possible?

00:42.740 --> 00:44.401
You both have to sleep, right?

00:44.440 --> 00:46.635
I'm... not his assistant.

00:46.680 --> 00:49.274
I... okay, the only reason
we are together all the time

00:49.310 --> 00:51.198
is because I live at his place.

00:51.250 --> 00:53.810
Okay.

00:53.850 --> 00:57.581
Don't know why you guys couldn't
have just told me that,

00:57.620 --> 00:59.110
but... fine.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.559
Okay, it's not like that.

01:00.590 --> 01:03.150
It's... we're not
together together.

01:03.190 --> 01:05.181
Okay, what is it like?

01:06.400 --> 01:08.288
(sighs)

01:08.330 --> 01:09.490
I-I...

01:09.530 --> 01:11.168
I-I can't say, I'm sorry.

01:11.200 --> 01:12.861
Well, Ms. Watson, if you
want me to help you,

01:12.900 --> 01:15.232
you're gonna have to tell me
what the story is, all right?

01:24.350 --> 01:25.749
I'm a sober companion.

01:25.780 --> 01:27.577
I work with recovering
drug addicts.

01:27.620 --> 01:29.247
Sherlock is my client.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.246
His father hired me
to help him stay clean.

01:31.290 --> 01:33.110
The only reason
I am telling you this

01:33.160 --> 01:34.718
is because I think
he may have relapsed.

01:34.760 --> 01:36.785
I need your help to find him.

01:38.830 --> 01:41.355
(vehicle drives past)

01:45.230 --> 01:47.562
Mm.

02:20.470 --> 02:21.767
(woman laughs)

02:21.800 --> 02:23.358
She's good.
She's great.

02:23.410 --> 02:24.866
Enough about her;
how are you?

02:24.910 --> 02:26.730
I'm good.
Yeah?

02:26.780 --> 02:28.236
Any new men in your life?

02:28.280 --> 02:29.702
Uh, sort of.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.445
But it's work,
I'm not dating anyone.

02:31.480 --> 02:32.708
Good.

02:32.750 --> 02:34.308
Maybe you won't be
as mad at me.

02:34.350 --> 02:35.874
What are you talking about?

02:35.920 --> 02:37.444
You split up with Ty
a while ago,

02:37.490 --> 02:38.741
and you never let me
set you up, so...

02:38.790 --> 02:40.257
Oh, Aaron!

02:40.290 --> 02:41.882
Hi! Over here.

02:41.920 --> 02:43.729
Are you serious?
Shut up.

02:43.760 --> 02:45.921
I'm gonna kill you.
Hey, Em.
Hi!

02:45.960 --> 02:48.451
Oh, I didn't realize
you were meeting someone else.

02:48.500 --> 02:49.592
Yeah, that's okay.
She didn't know, either.

02:49.630 --> 02:50.927
This is Aaron, from work.

02:50.970 --> 02:52.892
EMILY:
Have a seat.

02:52.940 --> 02:55.261
This is Joan, my oldest friend.
Was.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.507
Okay, I've got water
aerobics in 20 minutes.

02:57.540 --> 02:59.770
Wait, wait, I...
I know you two
are strangers, but...

02:59.810 --> 03:01.801
you're both fantastic,
and single, so...

03:01.840 --> 03:03.205
start with that.

03:03.250 --> 03:04.478
See where it goes.

03:04.510 --> 03:07.968
My treat.

03:08.020 --> 03:10.443
I think this is what
you call an ambush setup.

03:10.490 --> 03:11.889
Well, the good news is that I
don't have to buy you a drink.

03:11.920 --> 03:14.218
That's true.
Although I could go for

03:14.260 --> 03:15.682
a double vodka rocks
right about now.

03:15.720 --> 03:18.518
Do you normally drink
spirits before, um, what?

03:18.560 --> 03:20.596
10:00 in the morning?
No, but...

03:20.630 --> 03:22.894
go easy on me,
I've just been ambushed.

03:22.930 --> 03:24.329
(laughs)

03:24.370 --> 03:26.736
WOMAN:
Vanilla latte for... Aaron?

03:26.770 --> 03:28.294
Excuse me, that's me.

03:28.340 --> 03:30.661
Okay.

03:40.550 --> 03:42.586
(phone chimes)

03:42.620 --> 03:44.508
* There you are,
you and your friends *

03:44.550 --> 03:46.916
* Standing in a field
that's... *

03:46.960 --> 03:48.916
Sorry to snoop, but...

03:48.960 --> 03:51.485
"YT? ND U ASAP?"

03:51.530 --> 03:53.623
What, are you texting
with a teenager?

03:53.660 --> 03:55.594
A fully-grown adult, actually.

03:55.630 --> 03:57.825
Sorry, I haven't
done this in a while.

03:57.870 --> 04:00.589
Um... I don't know
where to start.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.938
Me neither.

04:02.970 --> 04:04.369
(phone chimes)

04:04.410 --> 04:07.573
Oh... "CUS"?

04:07.610 --> 04:08.975
I'm guessing that's
"see you soon,"

04:09.010 --> 04:11.899
but what is "IMLTHO"?

04:11.950 --> 04:14.646
HOLMES:
It means "In my less

04:14.680 --> 04:15.840
than humble opinion."

04:15.880 --> 04:18.417
Your abbreviations are becoming
borderline indecipherable.

04:18.450 --> 04:19.986
I don't know why,

04:20.020 --> 04:22.989
because you are obviously
capable of being articulate.

04:23.030 --> 04:24.679
Language is evolving, Watson,

04:24.730 --> 04:26.698
becoming a more efficient
version of itself.

04:26.730 --> 04:28.721
I love text shorthand.

04:28.760 --> 04:30.967
It allows you to convey content
and tone

04:31.000 --> 04:32.831
without losing velocity.

04:32.870 --> 04:34.462
Met a man, I see.

04:35.470 --> 04:36.835
A handsome one, at that.

04:36.870 --> 04:38.838
Um, this is the part
where I ask you

04:38.870 --> 04:40.076
how you knew that, right?

04:40.110 --> 04:41.429
You put your hair up

04:41.480 --> 04:42.879
when you want to look your best.

04:42.910 --> 04:44.446
You think it's more flattering.

04:44.480 --> 04:46.573
You're wrong, of course.
RSadmw.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.474
But it was down when you left
for coffee, and now it's up.

04:48.520 --> 04:50.545
Ergo, you unexpectedly
met a man

04:50.590 --> 04:51.716
you found attractive.

04:51.750 --> 04:53.308
Okay, what am I
doing here, anyway?

04:53.360 --> 04:54.554
You said it couldn't wait?

04:54.590 --> 04:57.081
I'm just trying to
stick to the terms
of our agreement.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.722
You said we're not
supposed to be apart

04:58.760 --> 05:00.091
for more than two hours,

05:00.130 --> 05:01.791
and I have a mysterious
errand to run,

05:01.830 --> 05:03.525
and I have no idea
how long it's gonna take.

05:03.570 --> 05:04.798
What kind of errand?

05:04.830 --> 05:06.559
We have been summoned
to a meeting

05:06.600 --> 05:08.534
of the Board of Directors
of Canon-Ebersole.

05:08.570 --> 05:10.800
The investment ﬁrm. What do
they want to see you about?

05:10.840 --> 05:12.432
I have no idea.

05:12.480 --> 05:14.573
Hence my use of
the word "mysterious."

05:14.610 --> 05:16.771
Apparently Gregson
recommended my services,

05:16.810 --> 05:18.744
and, uh, they won't
tell me anything else

05:18.780 --> 05:21.419
until I've signed
a confidentiality agreement.

05:21.450 --> 05:23.111
Uh, is that what
you're going to wear?

05:23.150 --> 05:25.345
What's wrong with it?

05:25.390 --> 05:27.881
It... I'm pretty sure you slept
in that T-shirt last night,

05:27.920 --> 05:31.378
and, um, the guys on Wall
Street are a little more...

05:31.430 --> 05:32.920
formal in the way they dress.

05:32.960 --> 05:34.518
Those are costumes.

05:34.560 --> 05:36.699
I loathe bankers.

05:36.730 --> 05:38.391
They rigged the roulette wheel
of commerce,

05:38.430 --> 05:39.829
very nearly destroyed
the world economy,

05:39.870 --> 05:42.134
and they still think
if they wear suits

05:42.170 --> 05:43.535
they'll be treated
like respectable folk

05:43.570 --> 05:45.902
instead of the crooks
that they are.

05:47.110 --> 05:49.544
My name is Jim Fowkes.

05:49.580 --> 05:50.979
I'm the chief investment
officer.

05:51.010 --> 05:53.570
This is Daniel Cho,
our chief financial officer,

05:53.620 --> 05:54.917
another in-house
board member...

05:54.950 --> 05:56.440
Yep, you're all
chief of something.

05:56.490 --> 05:57.843
What do you want?

05:57.890 --> 05:59.687
Mm.

05:59.720 --> 06:02.848
FOWKES:
This is our COO, Peter Talbott.

06:02.890 --> 06:05.450
Every quarter, he fields
a conference call with

06:05.490 --> 06:07.128
our institutional investors.

06:07.160 --> 06:09.993
These people control
huge pension funds.

06:10.030 --> 06:12.533
As far as they're
concerned, Peter's the
voice of the company.

06:12.570 --> 06:14.788
This quarter's call was
supposed to happen yesterday.

06:14.840 --> 06:17.764
We had to reschedule,
because Peter didn't show up.

06:17.810 --> 06:19.630
Nobody has any idea
where he is.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.636
And if you don't get this
call back on the books soon,

06:21.680 --> 06:23.545
people will start to whisper.

06:23.580 --> 06:26.549
When these people whisper,
Mr. Holmes,

06:26.580 --> 06:27.808
millions of dollars disappear.

06:27.850 --> 06:30.080
The gentleman
we spoke to,

06:30.120 --> 06:31.610
a, uh, Captain Gregson,

06:31.650 --> 06:33.049
he said that the NYPD
couldn't get involved

06:33.090 --> 06:35.081
until Peter had been
missing for two days.

06:35.120 --> 06:36.758
He also said that

06:36.790 --> 06:38.883
you were the finest
investigator he'd ever known.

06:38.930 --> 06:42.559
We'd like to hire you
and your, uh... associate.

06:42.600 --> 06:43.692
Bodyguard.

06:43.730 --> 06:45.960
Luckily for you,
Mr. Fowkes,

06:46.000 --> 06:47.695
I have a hole in my schedule.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.833
My usual private consulting
rates will apply, of course,

06:49.870 --> 06:53.431
multiplied by a factor
of 12, shall we say?

06:53.480 --> 06:54.902
You're wondering
if I'm worth it.

06:54.940 --> 06:57.079
I could provide a demonstration,
if you'd like.

06:57.110 --> 06:58.577
I'm fairly sure,

06:58.610 --> 06:59.770
for example,
that these two are

06:59.820 --> 07:01.617
sleeping with each other.

07:01.650 --> 07:02.844
You really should be more
careful of your body language.

07:02.890 --> 07:04.118
And you, for some reason,

07:04.150 --> 07:05.617
have recently used a solvent

07:05.650 --> 07:08.483
to remove fingernail polish
from your hands.

07:08.520 --> 07:10.852
12 times your usual rate
will be just fine.

07:10.890 --> 07:14.018
I will need access to Peter
Talbott's office, his computer.

07:14.060 --> 07:17.166
My secretary will be happy to
take you down there right now.

07:24.070 --> 07:25.765
Cute couple.

07:25.810 --> 07:27.038
WOMAN:
Everyone here calls
Peter and Alyssa

07:27.080 --> 07:28.638
"Taylor and Burton."

07:28.680 --> 07:29.908
You know,
after the movie stars.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.144
Fascinating.

07:31.180 --> 07:34.809
I'll be outside
if you need me.

07:34.850 --> 07:36.738
I don't think I've ever
seen you so happy,

07:36.790 --> 07:38.018
back in the
conference room.

07:38.050 --> 07:39.915
Mastering the Masters
of the Universe.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.484
Bit of a letdown,
actually.

07:41.520 --> 07:43.021
I think I could've got
20 times my normal rate.

07:43.060 --> 07:46.029
What is your normal rate?
Oh, I don't have one.

07:46.060 --> 07:47.925
Remind me to make one up
before I leave.

07:47.960 --> 07:49.496
Typical.

07:49.530 --> 07:51.168
Every stuffed shirt who
wants to pass for erudite

07:51.200 --> 07:52.758
has shelves full
of unread books.

07:52.800 --> 07:55.837
None of the spines on these
have ever been cracked.

07:55.870 --> 07:57.508
Except. . .

07:57.540 --> 08:00.771
this one.

08:00.810 --> 08:03.847
Which apparently Mr. Talbott
consults all the time.

08:12.090 --> 08:13.580
Ah.

08:13.620 --> 08:15.815
I've never been a fan of
John Maynard Keynes,

08:15.860 --> 08:17.521
but this I could
sink my teeth into.

08:17.560 --> 08:18.754
WATSON:
I don't understand.
What is that?

08:18.790 --> 08:20.291
It's a menu.

08:20.330 --> 08:22.821
Each of these girls is
available for a price.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.519
See the ring symbols
at the bottom?

08:24.570 --> 08:28.131
The more rings, the more
expensive the prostitute.

08:28.170 --> 08:30.263
So you're speaking
from experience?

08:30.310 --> 08:32.631
It's just a deduction.

08:32.680 --> 08:35.774
Though I am on
an expense account.

08:35.810 --> 08:37.846
Almost all these pages
are turned down.

08:37.880 --> 08:39.040
The more pricey girls

08:39.080 --> 08:40.945
were his favorites.

08:40.980 --> 08:42.538
But you can't just tell the IRS

08:42.590 --> 08:44.114
you spend six figures
a year on slappers.

08:44.150 --> 08:47.051
No, you need to
hide the expense. So...

08:47.090 --> 08:51.322
Let's see...
calendar, contacts...

08:51.360 --> 08:52.918
Yeah.

08:52.960 --> 08:55.690
You see?

08:55.730 --> 08:58.267
Talbott has contact addresses
for two separate accountants.

08:58.300 --> 09:01.792
This one is for a rep for DDB.

09:01.840 --> 09:04.104
That's a big five firm,
nothing untoward there.

09:04.140 --> 09:06.267
Probably handled the family
books. But this one...

09:06.310 --> 09:09.575
is an independent accountant
by the name of Martin Rydell.

09:09.610 --> 09:13.717
Handled something Peter calls
his "Executive Private Account."

09:13.750 --> 09:15.012
Excuse me!

09:15.050 --> 09:16.278
Secretary?

09:18.150 --> 09:19.344
What did Fowkes
say your name was?

09:19.390 --> 09:21.881
He didn't. It's Donna.

09:21.920 --> 09:24.127
Well, before we leave, Donna,
would you mind calling us in

09:24.160 --> 09:25.889
a reservation for three
at Villa Pacri?

09:28.030 --> 09:29.725
We're not dressed
for Villa Pacri.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.294
We're not dressed for
Canon-Ebersole, either.

09:31.330 --> 09:32.991
When I invite Martin Rydell
to lunch, it'll help if

09:33.040 --> 09:34.598
I drop the name of one of

09:34.640 --> 09:36.699
the most expensive
restaurants in the city.

09:40.780 --> 09:43.749
So you loathe Canon-Ebersole
and everything they stand for.

09:43.780 --> 09:45.145
But you love to
spend their money.

09:45.180 --> 09:47.375
You don't see any
inconsistency there?

09:47.420 --> 09:49.615
I'm redistributing as many
of their assets as I can.

09:49.650 --> 09:51.914
If I'm going to get in bed with
the croupiers of a rigged game,

09:51.950 --> 09:54.316
I'm going to make damn
_sure their wallets are
lighter In the morning.

09:54.360 --> 09:56.282
Sir?
Mm.

09:56.320 --> 09:59.653
And that is for?
It's the most expensive
bottle they've got.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.292
I don't care if it comes in_
a box, you're not drInkIng It.

10:01.330 --> 10:04.766
It's not for me.
You see that couple over there?

10:04.800 --> 10:06.665
I observed them
while you were in the bathroom.

10:06.700 --> 10:08.895
The man's suit is frayed
from dry cleaning.

10:08.940 --> 10:10.760
I'd wager it's
the only one he's got.

10:10.810 --> 10:13.631
Therefore, he saved to come here
for a special occasion.

10:13.680 --> 10:16.808
Also, he keeps touching the
inside pocket of his suit coat,

10:16.850 --> 10:18.909
like he's checking to see
that something valuable

10:18.950 --> 10:21.168
is still there.
He's about to propose.

10:21.220 --> 10:23.814
And I'm going to send this
wine over as congratulations.

10:23.850 --> 10:25.044
Or condolences.

10:25.090 --> 10:27.411
It's lovely, thank you.

10:27.460 --> 10:28.779
Mr. Holmes?

10:28.820 --> 10:31.323
Mr. Rydell.

10:35.730 --> 10:38.824
Confession: I told a couple
of white lies on the phone.

10:38.870 --> 10:40.929
I don't actually work
at Canon-Ebersole,

10:40.970 --> 10:42.835
_ and I have no_
Intention of opening

10:42.870 --> 10:45.338
a private executive
account with you.

10:45.370 --> 10:47.179
What I would like is
to discuss the work

10:47.210 --> 10:49.030
you did concealing Peter
Talbott's predilection

10:49.080 --> 10:50.240
for expensive hookers.

10:52.350 --> 10:54.079
I'm sorry, I think
maybe this is a mistake.

10:54.120 --> 10:55.974
Is it strictly legal,

10:56.020 --> 10:58.341
the private executive accounting
business? I bet not.

10:58.390 --> 11:00.312
Yet you seemed very eager to
take this meeting with me,

11:00.360 --> 11:03.750
so I'm quite sure that Peter
Talbott's not the only rich man

11:03.790 --> 11:05.451
to avail himself
of your serVIces.

11:05.490 --> 11:07.299
But by all means, leave.

11:07.330 --> 11:08.922
I'm sure there's any
number of magazines

11:08.960 --> 11:11.292
would love to
publish a story about

11:11.330 --> 11:13.036
the man who hides the dirty
secrets of Wall Street.

11:13.070 --> 11:15.197
The press is so
base these days.

11:16.070 --> 11:17.958
Excuse me.

11:18.010 --> 11:19.204
Hello. Is this the Post?

11:19.240 --> 11:21.902
Wait! (sighs)

11:21.940 --> 11:24.704
I work with Peter. _
I set up a shell corporation.

11:24.750 --> 11:27.241
We steer a little bit
of his paycheck

11:27.280 --> 11:29.339
into a quiet little slush fund.

11:29.380 --> 11:31.382
He can do whatever
he wants with it.

11:31.420 --> 11:33.217
And if he were using
this slush fund

11:33.260 --> 11:34.818
to binge on his
favorite bad habit,

11:34.860 --> 11:36.452
where do you suppose
we might find him?

11:37.860 --> 11:40.454
I rented an apartment in Tribeca

11:40.500 --> 11:42.764
under the name
of the dummy corp.

11:42.800 --> 11:45.997
Yes, I will!
Of course I will!

11:48.540 --> 11:50.167
That's lovely, isn't it?

11:50.210 --> 11:53.099
This apartment, we'll
need the address.

11:53.140 --> 11:55.199
The man you met
this morning,

11:55.240 --> 11:57.003
his name's Aaron, yes?

11:57.050 --> 11:59.769
He sent a text while you were
in the bathroom at lunch,

11:59.820 --> 12:01.469
asked if you wanted
to have dinner tonight.

12:01.520 --> 12:02.942
Didn't we already
have this conversation?

12:02.990 --> 12:04.116
You don't touch
my stuff.

12:04.150 --> 12:05.947
You said yes,
by the way.

12:05.990 --> 12:07.958
And you definitely don't
accept dates on my behalf.

12:07.990 --> 12:09.150
Why not? We're both
equally aware

12:09.190 --> 12:10.953
that you're attracted
to this man.

12:10.990 --> 12:12.821
No, we are both not equally
aware of my feelings.

12:12.860 --> 12:14.122
(bell ringing)

12:14.160 --> 12:15.297
MAN:
Super's office.

12:15.330 --> 12:16.820
(New York accent):
Yes, this is

12:16.870 --> 12:18.167
Detective Donowicz
of the NYPD.

12:18.200 --> 12:21.363
We got a warrant
to look inside apartment 2G.

12:21.400 --> 12:22.901
We don't have
a warrant.

12:22.940 --> 12:24.430
They almost never
ask to see it.

12:24.470 --> 12:26.335
(buzzer sounds)

12:30.950 --> 12:33.316
This is the apartment
he kept on the side?

12:33.350 --> 12:34.544
This place is amazing.

12:34.580 --> 12:37.185
(clears throat)

12:37.220 --> 12:40.451
Mr. Talbott, your bosses
would like a word.

12:59.510 --> 13:02.843
(indistinct radio transmission)

13:02.880 --> 13:04.541
WATSON:
You all right?

13:04.580 --> 13:07.242
I'm sure you already know
that the support meetings,

13:07.280 --> 13:10.044
you're not even allowed to name
the drug you've abused.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.239
Just saying it out loud

13:11.290 --> 13:13.110
might be enough
to make someone relapse.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.116
I told you I don't
pay attention in
those meetings.

13:15.160 --> 13:18.379
Heroin was one of the drugs
that landed you in rehab.

13:18.430 --> 13:21.126
You're not just
hearing the word.

13:21.160 --> 13:23.993
You're in a apartment where
it's laid out in front of you.

13:24.030 --> 13:25.395
Do you want to get
away from this?

13:25.430 --> 13:27.159
We can go outside
and talk.

13:27.200 --> 13:29.168
I'm fine. I have to be.
I'm working a case.

13:29.200 --> 13:31.259
And talking about
my feelings

13:31.310 --> 13:32.937
is not gonna get
it solved, right?

13:32.980 --> 13:35.540
Peter Talbott
is right there.
Your job is over.

13:35.580 --> 13:38.071
Over? Do you see that
salad sitting there?

13:38.110 --> 13:43.082
Captain, you're classifying this
as an accidental overdose, yeah?

13:43.120 --> 13:45.588
We'll wait on the ME. to make
the final determination,

13:45.620 --> 13:48.088
but you're looking at
the same picture we are.

13:48.120 --> 13:49.553
Indeed. But I don't think
we need to wait on the Examiner

13:49.590 --> 13:51.057
to get started--
I think there's a good chance

13:51.090 --> 13:52.580
Peter Talbott was murdered.

13:52.630 --> 13:54.154
Murdered? The guy's holding
the needle he used

13:54.200 --> 13:55.428
to shoot himself up.

13:55.460 --> 13:58.224
He's holding the needle that
someone used to shoot him up.

13:58.270 --> 14:00.192
Look at his arm.
There's no track marks on it.

14:00.240 --> 14:03.368
Doesn't mean anything-- a junkie
can find a vein aanhere.

14:03.410 --> 14:05.230
Look around you.
Does this look like

14:05.270 --> 14:09.400
the typical apartment
of a hardcore heroin user?

14:09.440 --> 14:12.079
It's-It's-It's pristine!

14:12.110 --> 14:14.578
I'd wager even the food

14:14.620 --> 14:17.418
is perfectly arranged.

14:17.450 --> 14:20.453
Ha. Does that look like
the typical fridge

14:20.490 --> 14:22.515
of a heroin addict?

14:22.560 --> 14:24.926
No, not a typical one.

14:24.960 --> 14:28.293
Heroin users are looking
for oblivion.

14:28.330 --> 14:30.321
They want the drug
to dull their senses.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.463
That's why when they overdose,
usually you find them in

14:32.500 --> 14:34.536
squalid apartments
or alleyways.

14:34.570 --> 14:37.607
They don't often keep apartments
like this.

14:37.640 --> 14:41.633
And it's rare-ish that
they hold jobs as a COO

14:41.680 --> 14:43.671
of a billion-_dollar
corporation.

14:43.710 --> 14:47.942
So you're saying someone gave
Peter Talbott that shot?

14:47.980 --> 14:50.039
How? There's no sign
of a struggle here.

14:50.090 --> 14:51.239
You can't walk
up to someone

14:51.290 --> 14:53.281
and stick a syringe
in their arm.

14:53.320 --> 14:57.188
No, you would need them
to be unconscious first.

14:57.230 --> 15:00.358
Okay, granted I've never been
hit with a salad container,

15:00.400 --> 15:02.425
but I'm pretty sure
it wouldn't knock you out.

15:02.460 --> 15:04.963
The killer would need
Peter to be insensate

15:05.000 --> 15:07.662
before delivering
the fatal shot.

15:07.700 --> 15:09.133
But a drug other
than heroin would

15:09.170 --> 15:10.637
surely show up
on tox screens.

15:10.670 --> 15:12.501
So what's the most
efficient solution?

15:12.540 --> 15:14.974
If Peter Talbott
was murdered,

15:15.010 --> 15:18.502
I'd imagine the first dose
of heroin came from here.

15:18.550 --> 15:20.643
After he passed out,

15:20.680 --> 15:23.240
the killer dragged him

15:23.290 --> 15:27.954
to the chair where
he delivered the fatal shot.

15:27.990 --> 15:29.651
You think someone
closed his salad dressing?

15:29.690 --> 15:31.385
I think it's worth
exploring.

15:31.430 --> 15:33.091
It's easy enough to
find out if I'm right.

15:33.130 --> 15:34.256
We just test
the salad

15:34.300 --> 15:35.426
for the presence
of heroin.

15:35.460 --> 15:37.098
I'll hold my
breath on that.

15:37.130 --> 15:39.428
Meantime, I got to
notify Talbott's wife

15:39.470 --> 15:42.268
of all... this.
I'm coming.

15:42.300 --> 15:44.666
He-he keeps a special
apartment for prostitutes.

15:44.710 --> 15:47.634
If he was murdered,
surely his wife had motive.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.136
You can watch.

15:49.180 --> 15:50.647
She just lost
her husband--

15:50.680 --> 15:53.569
the last thing she needs
to deal with right now...

15:53.620 --> 15:55.440
is you.

15:57.690 --> 16:00.113
WOMAN:
Oh, my God.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.287
Peter said he
was done with it all.

16:02.320 --> 16:04.720
The girls, the partying.

16:04.760 --> 16:07.251
He just told me
he was ready for kids

16:07.300 --> 16:09.689
and you're saying
he was using heroin?
Every cool?

16:09.730 --> 16:11.595
BELL: Our sincere condolences.
You're staring.

16:11.630 --> 16:13.029
Ms. Talbott,

16:13.070 --> 16:14.492
sorry to interrupt.

16:14.540 --> 16:16.235
Would you mind telling us
where you were

16:16.270 --> 16:18.602
two nights ago between the hours
of 6:00 and midnight?

16:18.640 --> 16:20.301
What?
The medical examiner

16:20.340 --> 16:21.500
estimates that's
when your husband died.

16:21.540 --> 16:23.144
I was wondering
where you where.

16:23.180 --> 16:24.442
No.
You-you think
I'd hurt my husband?

16:24.480 --> 16:26.778
No, no, everything
we've seen so far

16:26.810 --> 16:28.277
says accidental death.

16:28.320 --> 16:29.446
HOLMES:
Even so-- your whereabouts.

16:29.480 --> 16:31.539
You don't...
have to answer that.

16:31.590 --> 16:33.581
I-I volunteer
at Habitat for Humanity.

16:33.620 --> 16:35.508
I was at a silent auction.

16:35.560 --> 16:38.324
Th-There must have been
200 people who saw me there.

16:38.360 --> 16:39.657
Thank you.

16:39.690 --> 16:41.248
And until today,

16:41.300 --> 16:43.427
you had no idea your
husband was using heroin?

16:43.470 --> 16:44.721
I told you, no.

16:44.770 --> 16:46.294
I'm shocked.

16:47.500 --> 16:49.639
But... I...

16:49.670 --> 16:51.661
can't say I'm...

16:51.710 --> 16:53.439
totally surprised.

16:53.480 --> 16:56.131
He's been overwhelmed ever
since they named him COO.

16:56.180 --> 16:58.648
Peter used to say he thought
the last guy dropped dead

16:58.680 --> 17:00.545
just to get out of
going into work.

17:00.580 --> 17:01.808
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

17:01.850 --> 17:03.613
Did you just say

17:03.650 --> 17:05.083
the previous
chief operating officer

17:05.120 --> 17:07.350
of Canon-Ebersole also died?

17:07.390 --> 17:09.813
He was allergic to peanuts--
he died when some restaurant

17:09.860 --> 17:11.748
put the wrong oil
in his lunch.

17:11.790 --> 17:13.189
How long ago was that?

17:13.230 --> 17:14.458
Last October. Why?
What does this

17:14.500 --> 17:15.626
have to do with Peter?

17:15.660 --> 17:16.627
Nothing at all.

17:16.660 --> 17:17.627
We're finished here.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.365
Thank you very much

17:19.400 --> 17:20.435
for coming in.

17:20.470 --> 17:21.494
And again, we've very,

17:21.540 --> 17:23.303
very sorry for your loss.

17:23.340 --> 17:24.534
Yes.

17:29.210 --> 17:30.643
Peanut allergies?

17:30.680 --> 17:32.238
Seriously?

17:32.280 --> 17:35.249
Canon-Ebersole has lost
two COO's in a year.

17:35.280 --> 17:37.510
That seems like
a dangerous job.

17:37.550 --> 17:40.383
(speaking Mandarin)

17:43.360 --> 17:45.351
You speak Mandarin?

17:45.390 --> 17:47.392
Not as well as
I'd like. You?

17:47.430 --> 17:49.125
Not as well as _
my mother would like.

17:49.160 --> 17:50.320
Who was that?

17:50.370 --> 17:52.361
The chef that
prepared the meal

17:52.400 --> 17:55.267
that killed Peter
Talbott's predecessor
at Canon-Ebersole.

17:55.300 --> 17:56.767
Any particular reason?

17:56.800 --> 17:58.529
I won't get
the test results back

17:58.570 --> 18:00.538
from Peter Talbott's salad
for a couple of hours.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.639
In the meantime,
I suppose I'm just curious.

18:02.680 --> 18:04.705
The previous COO
of Canon-Ebersole

18:04.750 --> 18:07.173
was a man named Gary Norris.

18:07.220 --> 18:08.710
Terrible allergies.

18:08.750 --> 18:11.184
Yes, noted earlier.

18:11.220 --> 18:14.314
Did you know he was fanatical
about avoiding peanut products?

18:14.360 --> 18:16.180
He ate every single takeout meal

18:16.220 --> 18:17.858
from the same
Chinese restaurant.

18:17.890 --> 18:20.154
He had a special arrangement
with the chef,

18:20.200 --> 18:22.293
who knew never
to have peanut 0i! around

18:22.330 --> 18:24.423
when he was preparing
Gary Norris's meals.

18:24.470 --> 18:26.722
Well, it only takes one slip up.

18:26.770 --> 18:28.897
But the chef swears
he didn't slip up.

18:28.940 --> 18:31.738
He prepared that meal
personally, and he believes

18:31.770 --> 18:34.568
that someone put the peanut oil
in Gary Norris's food

18:34.610 --> 18:36.475
after it left his kitchen.

18:36.510 --> 18:38.740
I'm starting to think
he could be right.

18:38.780 --> 18:40.748
Death by peanut oil--
that would be

18:40.780 --> 18:42.919
a brilliant way to kill someone.
Hmm.

18:42.950 --> 18:46.317
If Peter Talbott was murdered,
the MO. is consistent:

18:46.350 --> 18:47.886
eliminate your target

18:47.920 --> 18:50.388
in a way that the world thinks
is an accident.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.386
Damn it!

18:54.930 --> 18:58.491
Earlier, when I asked you
about being around heroin again,

18:58.530 --> 19:00.862
you wanted to say something?

19:00.900 --> 19:02.629
I could tell.

19:02.670 --> 19:06.265
I'd forgotten
what it smells like.

19:06.310 --> 19:09.473
Cooked heroin.

19:09.510 --> 19:12.547
It brought back memories.

19:12.580 --> 19:17.244
You also said that heroin users
want to dull their senses,

19:17.290 --> 19:19.781
that they crave oblivion.

19:19.820 --> 19:22.209
Is that what you wanted?

19:22.260 --> 19:23.557
It's nearly 7:00.

19:23.590 --> 19:25.387
You're gonna miss
your dinner date.

19:25.430 --> 19:26.852
I'm not going.
You need me tonight.

19:26.890 --> 19:28.426
Actually...

19:28.460 --> 19:32.226
what I need, I believe,
is privacy tonight.

19:32.270 --> 19:33.862
I'm not gonna
relapse.

19:33.900 --> 19:36.698
Besides, if I wanted drugs,
I could always just

19:36.740 --> 19:39.436
climb out the window,
whether you're here or not.

19:39.470 --> 19:41.472
Go.

19:41.510 --> 19:44.707
If it makes you happy, I'll take
a spit test when you get back.

19:46.610 --> 19:48.373
All right.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.784
I am officially
calling it.

19:59.830 --> 20:01.798
"Foam" is-is not
a category of food.

20:01.830 --> 20:03.559
(laughs):
It just isn't.

20:03.600 --> 20:05.921
I feel like I should
take you to a restaurant

20:05.970 --> 20:07.631
that provides
actual sustenance.

20:07.670 --> 20:09.729
That's all right.
After all the
bubbles subsided,

20:09.770 --> 20:11.328
there was food underneath.

20:11.370 --> 20:12.803
No,youTe
missing my point.

20:12.840 --> 20:14.876
Can't you see that's
my stealthy way

20:14.910 --> 20:16.878
of asking you out
on another date.

20:16.910 --> 20:18.878
Oh, smooth!

20:18.910 --> 20:21.947
Yeah. So smooth you
didn't even notice.

20:21.980 --> 20:24.585
No, I didn't.
(laughs): I was...

20:24.620 --> 20:27.316
Seriously, though,
I... I had fun.

20:28.490 --> 20:30.378
Most of my dates
these days

20:30.430 --> 20:32.352
are spent talking
about ex-husbands.

20:32.390 --> 20:33.891
You didn't go there.

20:33.930 --> 20:35.693
Well, that's easy--
I've never been married.

20:35.730 --> 20:37.721
What about you?
No.

20:44.970 --> 20:47.336
Your chariot.

20:49.080 --> 20:51.048
(clears throat):
So, uh...

20:51.080 --> 20:54.447
like I said,
this was fun.

20:54.480 --> 20:55.879
It was.

20:57.750 --> 20:59.741
Thanks.

21:01.460 --> 21:02.757
Thank you.

21:02.790 --> 21:04.348
(laughs)

21:09.030 --> 21:10.497
Who are they?

21:10.530 --> 21:11.997
Employees of
Canon-Ebersole

21:12.030 --> 21:14.567
who have died over
the last ten years.

21:14.600 --> 21:16.033
It is a big company.

21:16.070 --> 21:18.436
Odds are they're gonna lose
some people along the way.

21:18.470 --> 21:20.836
And some of these,
no doubt, are random.

21:20.880 --> 21:23.576
But there could be a pattern
hidden in there.

21:23.610 --> 21:25.999
How was your date?
Good.

21:26.050 --> 21:27.642
Fun.

21:28.650 --> 21:30.618
I think maybe
he lied to me.

21:30.650 --> 21:33.357
It was the end of the night
and we were talking

21:33.390 --> 21:34.914
about whether or_ not
we've been married,

21:34.960 --> 21:37.485
and when he said he hadn't--
and this isn't something

21:37.530 --> 21:39.782
I would've noticed before
I started working with you--

21:39.830 --> 21:42.628
but I... could swear
he wasn't telling the truth.

21:42.660 --> 21:44.628
Flexing our deductive
muscles, are we?

21:44.670 --> 21:46.023
I could burst with pride.

21:46.070 --> 21:47.765
The next step is confirmation.

21:47.800 --> 21:50.462
It's easy enough to find out
if he was married.

21:50.510 --> 21:51.761
What was his last name?

21:51.810 --> 21:53.038
Whoa. Hold on.

21:53.070 --> 21:54.879
Not a cyber-stalker.

21:54.910 --> 21:56.798
Do you want to find out
if you're right or don't you?

21:58.680 --> 22:00.910
(sighs)
His last name is Ward.

22:00.950 --> 22:03.009
Quick visit
to maritalrecords.com

22:03.050 --> 22:05.644
tells us that Aaron Ward

22:05.690 --> 22:08.682
of New York City was...

22:08.720 --> 22:10.017
Oh.

22:10.060 --> 22:11.857
"Oh." "Oh"-- what
does that mean?

22:11.890 --> 22:13.949
He wasn't married.
_ Oh. _
He is married.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.390
To a woman
called Grace Arber.

22:17.430 --> 22:18.863
They just celebrated
their anniversary.

22:18.900 --> 22:20.458
How could Emily set me
up with a married guy?

22:20.500 --> 22:22.434
Well, look at it this way:
your instincts were right.

22:22.470 --> 22:24.665
And you're home early, so
I assume you haven't become

22:24.710 --> 22:26.439
an unwitting adulteress.

22:26.470 --> 22:27.630
(phone chimes)

22:27.680 --> 22:29.375
I knew it!

22:29.410 --> 22:31.799
Knew what?
That's the NYPD lab.

22:31.850 --> 22:34.512
They agreed to rush the tests
of Peter Talbott's salad

22:34.550 --> 22:37.018
and there were_trace amounts
of her0in in it.

22:37.050 --> 22:38.608
Mm.
My advice...

22:38.650 --> 22:40.049
don't dwell on that man's
petty deceptions.

22:40.090 --> 22:41.512
You need your rest.

22:41.560 --> 22:43.778
We're going to
Canon-Ebersole tomorrow.

22:43.830 --> 22:45.149
We're going to call
another meeting of
their Board of Directors.

22:45.190 --> 22:47.454
Can you do that? You don't
even work there anymore.

22:47.500 --> 22:48.922
Not technically, but I think

22:48.960 --> 22:50.564
they're gonna want my help
in trying to figure out

22:50.600 --> 22:52.397
whether there's a murderer
working there.

22:54.140 --> 22:57.564
HOLMES:
Miles Durham, former head trader
in your Denver ofﬁce.

22:57.610 --> 23:00.932
Mr. _Durham was a volunteer with
Wilderness search and rescue

23:00.980 --> 23:03.949
who always filed his travel
plans with the ranger office

23:03.980 --> 23:05.447
whenever he went camping.

23:05.480 --> 23:06.708
CHO:
We're busy people, Mr. Holmes.

23:06.750 --> 23:08.047
What are we doing here?

23:08.080 --> 23:10.844
Maria Filipello.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.915
She ran your equities
division in Dallas.

23:12.950 --> 23:14.986
She suffocated in 2005

23:15.020 --> 23:17.079
when the natural gas line
running into her house ruptured.

23:17.120 --> 23:19.588
Never been another problem
with that brand of piping

23:19.630 --> 23:21.427
before or since.

23:21.460 --> 23:22.791
Jason Palmer.

23:22.830 --> 23:24.195
He worked in
the New York office.

23:24.230 --> 23:27.063
Got a $5 million bonus in 2009.

23:27.100 --> 23:28.931
Then drowned,
while swimming in a lake

23:28.970 --> 23:30.198
near his home
in the Catskills.

23:30.240 --> 23:31.605
The odd things is,

23:31.640 --> 23:33.005
when Jason Palmer
was in college,

23:33.040 --> 23:34.803
he was a beach lifeguard
at Martha's Vineyard.

23:34.840 --> 23:36.671
Uh, respectfully,
Mr. Holmes,

23:36.710 --> 23:39.679
you found Peter,
he O.D.'d, we're done.

23:39.710 --> 23:40.870
Peter Talbott was murdered.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.478
The police are
investigating now.

23:42.520 --> 23:44.579
I believe the man who killed him

23:44.620 --> 23:47.748
also killed your
previous COO, Gary Norris.

23:47.790 --> 23:49.212
And these three
unfortunate souls.

23:49.260 --> 23:50.750
Possibly one or two
others, as well.

23:50.790 --> 23:53.088
I can't find a plausible
motive for anyone

23:53.130 --> 23:55.724
outside the company to have
committed these murders.

23:55.760 --> 23:57.022
These are not crimes of passion.

23:57.060 --> 23:58.220
They're too
well-concealed for that.

23:58.270 --> 24:00.022
They're crimes of opportunity.

24:00.070 --> 24:02.766
I think you may have
a sociopath in your midst.

24:02.800 --> 24:06.167
A particularly cunning,
methodical killer.

24:06.210 --> 24:08.178
If I'm right,
they wait, they analyze,

24:08.210 --> 24:10.542
and when the time is right
to give themselves a leg up,

24:10.580 --> 24:12.070
they pounce.

24:12.110 --> 24:15.546
You're saying someone is killing
their way up the ladder?

24:15.580 --> 24:16.842
That sounds insane to me.

24:16.880 --> 24:19.542
I'd love to be wrong.

24:19.590 --> 24:22.582
But someone did dose Peter
Talbott's salad with heroin.

24:22.620 --> 24:25.054
As for the rest,
you let me do my work.

24:25.090 --> 24:27.229
I'll need access
to your records.

24:27.260 --> 24:28.989
If this person is here,
I'll find them.

24:29.030 --> 24:33.592
We control billions of dollars
worth of assets, Mr. Holmes.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.790
We can't give you
access to these files.

24:35.840 --> 24:37.603
They're confidential.
I don't need to audit you,

24:37.640 --> 24:39.130
I just need to do
some simple math.

24:39.170 --> 24:41.229
There can't be that many people

24:41.280 --> 24:42.929
who worked in Denver in 2003,

24:42.980 --> 24:44.208
Dallas in 2005,

24:44.250 --> 24:45.842
New York since 2009.

24:45.880 --> 24:47.142
IfI can find
this person quickly,

24:47.180 --> 24:49.068
I can wrap this up
with a minimum of scandal.

24:49.120 --> 24:50.542
All right, enough.

24:50.590 --> 24:52.285
FOWKES:
This is not necessary.

24:52.320 --> 24:53.617
Are you listening to me?

24:53.660 --> 24:55.218
There may be a murderer
at Canon-Ebersole.

24:55.260 --> 24:57.148
There's not a killer.
You know how I know that?

24:57.190 --> 24:58.885
Because the only person
with the career path

24:58.930 --> 25:00.852
that you're describing is me.

25:00.900 --> 25:02.299
What are you saying?

25:02.330 --> 25:04.127
That I murdered, like,
what, like five people?

25:06.770 --> 25:08.294
Well, this is a bit awkward,

25:08.340 --> 25:10.535
but I-I'd say that you're
a damn good suspect.

25:14.840 --> 25:17.570
(doorbell rings)

25:17.610 --> 25:20.647
I thought I'd bring you
your check personally.

25:22.750 --> 25:25.241
Do we?

25:27.320 --> 25:28.719
Eggs?

25:28.760 --> 25:30.113
I'm sure I could
find another fork.

25:30.160 --> 25:32.128
I'm not hungry.
I came here to end this.

25:32.160 --> 25:33.320
Well, that should be
simple enough.

25:33.360 --> 25:34.896
Just confess.

25:34.930 --> 25:37.125
Save us both a great deal
of time and trouble.

25:37.160 --> 25:40.095
Do you have any idea
what you did to me today?

25:40.130 --> 25:42.598
Do you know what it takes
just to survive

25:42.640 --> 25:44.005
at a place
like Canon-Ebersole?

25:44.040 --> 25:45.962
I think avoiding you
would be a good start.

25:46.010 --> 25:48.877
I've never killed anyone.

25:48.910 --> 25:53.108
I went to parochial school,
Mr. Holmes.

25:53.150 --> 25:55.744
I've pretty much broken every
commandment they ever taught me.

25:55.780 --> 25:58.112
Father Ray probably
isn't very proud of me,

25:58.150 --> 26:01.153
but then again, Father Ray
doesn't have a country house.

26:01.190 --> 26:04.159
I was inches away
from becoming COO,

26:04.190 --> 26:05.782
which everybody knows

26:05.830 --> 26:07.718
is where they groom you
for the big chair.

26:07.760 --> 26:10.149
And you accuse me of murder.

26:10.200 --> 26:12.668
You think everybody in
that place isn't talking?

26:13.840 --> 26:15.660
Gossip's poison
in that place.

26:15.700 --> 26:17.292
Doesn't matter that
I'm completely innocent.

26:17.340 --> 26:19.900
I'm never gonna get that job.

26:19.940 --> 26:21.771
Sorry. Are you done?

26:21.810 --> 26:24.040
Every time you say "innocent,"
I... I tune out.

26:24.080 --> 26:26.173
In that case, I'm just
going to have to prove it
to you, aren't I?

26:26.210 --> 26:29.748
Miles Durham, the first
of these so-called murders.

26:29.780 --> 26:31.281
He disappeared
during a camping trip.

26:31.320 --> 26:32.878
August 2003, right?

26:32.920 --> 26:35.912
He left August 7...

26:35.960 --> 26:39.782
He was supposed
to return August 9.

26:40.960 --> 26:42.791
What is this?
Medical records. Mine.

26:42.830 --> 26:45.890
I had elective surgery,
August 6, 2003.

26:45.930 --> 26:47.795
There were, uh...

26:47.840 --> 26:49.193
complications.

26:49.240 --> 26:52.164
I wasn't released
until August 12.

26:52.210 --> 26:53.837
Liposuction.
Rhytidoplasty.

26:53.880 --> 26:55.802
You had a face-lift.

26:55.840 --> 26:58.377
You see many jowly men on the
cover of Barron's, Mr. Holmes?

26:58.410 --> 27:01.208
My point is, I couldn't have
murdered Miles Durham.

27:01.250 --> 27:03.172
And I'll tell you
something else.

27:03.220 --> 27:07.111
Dan Cho-_-
arrogant little pissant--

27:07.150 --> 27:09.880
no, he didn't work
for Canon-Ebersole in 2003,

27:09.920 --> 27:12.127
because he had a summer
internship With us

27:12.160 --> 27:14.025
while he was in business school.

27:14.060 --> 27:15.698
Worked at our Denver office.

27:15.730 --> 27:17.766
Here's his file.

27:17.800 --> 27:21.292
We hired him in 2005,
sent him to Dallas.

27:21.340 --> 27:23.729
You think there's a sociopath
working for us?

27:23.770 --> 27:26.705
Let me let you in on
a little secret, Mr. Holmes.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.700
We're all sociopaths.

27:33.820 --> 27:35.276
WATSON :
Hey.

27:35.320 --> 27:38.312
Hey, I'm trying to
read up there.

27:38.350 --> 27:39.715
This doesn't make any sense.

27:39.750 --> 27:41.786
Yes, Dan Cho
interned in Denver

27:41.820 --> 27:43.310
during the summer of 2003.

27:43.360 --> 27:45.351
But he didn't benefit
from the first murder.

27:45.390 --> 27:47.824
Company didn't even hire him
till two years later.

27:47.860 --> 27:49.327
First of all,
you're not even sure

27:49.360 --> 27:50.725
_ Miles Durham's
disappearance was a murder.

27:50.770 --> 27:51.919
Okay, let's say it was.

27:51.970 --> 27:53.289
Maybe this guy Dan Cho

27:53.330 --> 27:55.059
killed him to get
a charge out of it.

27:55.100 --> 27:57.091
The-the murder was the benefit.

27:57.140 --> 27:58.368
People who enjoy killing

27:58.410 --> 28:00.207
like to share their
enthusiasm with others.

28:00.240 --> 28:03.004
They want everyone to know
there's a murderer out there.

28:03.040 --> 28:04.974
And anyway, even after
he was hired,

28:05.010 --> 28:06.477
he didn't benefit
from the deaths

28:06.510 --> 28:08.239
nearly as much as Jim Fowkes.

28:08.280 --> 28:10.475
But Jim Fowkes...

28:10.520 --> 28:12.385
Jim Fowkes didn't
do the first one!

28:12.420 --> 28:14.081
It would appear not!

28:14.120 --> 28:16.350
(phone chimes)

28:16.390 --> 28:18.278
Marrying man?

28:18.330 --> 28:19.729
He just won't quit.

28:19.760 --> 28:21.125
He says he is married,

28:21.160 --> 28:23.094
but he wants to_ meet me
to explain himself.

28:23.130 --> 28:24.893
You should go.
Coffee with a creep?

28:24.930 --> 28:26.727
No, thanks.
If nothing else,

28:26.770 --> 28:28.988
it would be an interesting
experiment in deduction for you.

28:29.040 --> 28:30.166
Spot the lie.

28:30.200 --> 28:31.861
Besides...

28:31.910 --> 28:33.400
I need time to think,

28:33.440 --> 28:36.034
which means it's not gonna
get any quieter around here.

28:36.080 --> 28:38.401
I...

28:48.460 --> 28:51.520
Donna.

28:51.560 --> 28:53.118
Can I get you something?

28:53.160 --> 28:55.492
I'm good.

28:57.200 --> 28:59.794
How did you find
out I'm married?

28:59.830 --> 29:02.196
Um... I thought you
wanted to explain yourself,

29:02.240 --> 29:03.935
not the other way around.
Okay, wait.

29:03.970 --> 29:06.063
I did lie to you.

29:06.110 --> 29:07.532
I did.

29:07.570 --> 29:10.073
But it's not what you think.

29:10.110 --> 29:12.408
I volunteer, uh,

29:12.450 --> 29:15.010
for a place called
Shoreline Community Services.

29:15.050 --> 29:16.870
It's a legal aid thing.

29:16.920 --> 29:20.014
We... work with people who are
seeking political asylum.

29:20.050 --> 29:21.358
A while back,

29:21.390 --> 29:23.551
I helped out with
a woman from Kosovo.

29:23.590 --> 29:25.854
Her father was a
general in the war,

29:25.890 --> 29:27.824
for the losing side,

29:27.860 --> 29:31.159
and when it ended, he
was shot in the street.

29:31.200 --> 29:33.839
She would have been killed
had she returned home.

29:33.870 --> 29:36.191
But _the US. wouldn't
give her asylum.

29:38.540 --> 29:41.407
So you married her
to keep her in the country.

29:41.440 --> 29:43.305
Do you have a relationship?

29:43.340 --> 29:44.876
Mm...

29:44.910 --> 29:46.844
She lives in Hoboken.

29:46.880 --> 29:50.247
I check in on her
sometimes. That's it.

29:50.280 --> 29:52.384
We can get a divorce in a year,

29:52.420 --> 29:54.479
without the government
crawling all over us.

29:56.920 --> 29:59.184
I would have told
you eventually,

29:59.230 --> 30:00.549
if there was an "eventually."

30:00.590 --> 30:03.297
But, uh...

30:03.330 --> 30:06.458
but now I'm just... I'm sorry.

30:06.500 --> 30:08.138
(sighs)

30:08.170 --> 30:11.264
Helping her was a really
compassionate thing to do.

30:11.310 --> 30:14.006
Thank you.

30:14.040 --> 30:17.077
But if you don't mind my asking,
how did you find out about it?

30:20.580 --> 30:21.877
(chimes)

30:21.920 --> 30:23.069
HOLMES:
Excuse me.

30:23.120 --> 30:24.485
Donna?

30:24.520 --> 30:26.488
It is Donna, right?

30:26.520 --> 30:28.215
(sighs)

30:28.260 --> 30:30.353
No one ever remembers the
secretary, do they, Donna?

30:30.390 --> 30:32.051
Excuse me, what?

30:32.090 --> 30:34.229
As a career choice,
has its limits.

30:34.260 --> 30:37.423
But then it does afford one a
certain cloak of invisibility.

30:37.460 --> 30:39.428
I-I don't know
what you're talking about.

30:39.470 --> 30:41.438
But I'm pretty sure
that Mr. Fowkes

30:41.470 --> 30:43.438
had you banned
from the building.

30:43.470 --> 30:45.438
You've been with him
a long time, haven't you?

30:45.470 --> 30:47.301
Until tonight,
I just assumed that you'd...

30:47.340 --> 30:49.501
come to work with him
after he moved to New York.

30:49.540 --> 30:52.043
Then I saw your name
as the emergency contact

30:52.080 --> 30:54.219
for a surgical procedure
he had in Denver.

30:55.680 --> 30:57.614
You followed him to Dallas, too,
didn't you?

30:57.650 --> 31:00.380
Mr. Fowkes is a good boss,
and we're loyal to each other.

31:00.420 --> 31:02.308
He's certainly had
a meteoric rise.

31:02.360 --> 31:05.921
And he probably owes some of
that to you, doesn't he, Donna?

31:08.000 --> 31:09.319
Jim Fowkes wasn't
the only one to benefit

31:09.360 --> 31:12.158
from the deaths
at Canon-Ebersole, was he?

31:12.200 --> 31:13.895
Do I need to call security?

31:13.940 --> 31:15.430
By all means. Hmm.
Let's loop them

31:15.470 --> 31:16.562
into the conversation.

31:16.600 --> 31:17.589
(elevator bell dings)

31:19.540 --> 31:20.973
No?

31:21.010 --> 31:22.875
Didn't think so.

31:25.350 --> 31:28.239
Quite obvious when you look
at it in the proper light.

31:28.280 --> 31:30.987
Every time Jim got promoted,
you had something to gain.

31:31.020 --> 31:32.908
Pay raise,
stock options.

31:32.950 --> 31:35.555
The company even contributes
to your retirement plan now.

31:35.590 --> 31:38.127
So? I've given them
years of my life.

31:38.160 --> 31:39.525
Must be quite
a feeling--

31:39.560 --> 31:41.494
steering the fate
of a giant company

31:41.530 --> 31:43.191
from your tiny
little cubicle.

31:43.230 --> 31:45.164
(sighs)
Get away from me.

31:45.200 --> 31:48.237
Question is did your boss know
or were you working alone?

31:48.270 --> 31:50.932
If you collaborated, it would
behoove you to start talking.

31:50.970 --> 31:53.700
First one to tattle gets
the shortest sentence.

31:53.740 --> 31:56.402
_I've seen executives
like you come and go.

31:56.440 --> 31:59.307
A little bit of smarts,
a whole lot of ego.

31:59.350 --> 32:01.215
Take my word, you've never
seen anyone like me.

32:01.250 --> 32:04.378
Oh, sure, I have.
My bosses use $5,000 suits

32:04.420 --> 32:06.115
to get attention.

32:06.150 --> 32:08.015
You use a scarf and
an old T-shirt.

32:08.060 --> 32:09.982
(chuckles)
You're so proud
of yourself

32:10.020 --> 32:11.385
for what you think
you discovered,

32:11.430 --> 32:13.079
you just couldn't
wait to tell me.

32:13.130 --> 32:14.950
Even if it meant
followmg me into an empty

32:15.000 --> 32:16.399
parking garage.

32:16.430 --> 32:18.421
(stun gun zapping)

32:31.710 --> 32:33.701
(passing car horn honking)

32:35.750 --> 32:37.274
(groans)

32:37.320 --> 32:38.548
You're awake.

32:38.590 --> 32:40.148
Good.

32:40.190 --> 32:42.010
Yeah, I've pursued
my fair share of...

32:42.060 --> 32:43.459
killers, Miss Kaplan.

32:43.490 --> 32:45.720
Most of them... most of them
are dreary people, but you

32:45.760 --> 32:48.695
I-I've a certain fascination
with. You, uh...

32:48.730 --> 32:51.426
(sighs)
Such initiative.

32:51.470 --> 32:52.994
Such patience.

32:53.030 --> 32:54.668
I don't think
this is gonna work out

32:54.700 --> 32:57.430
for you though.
Too rash.

32:57.470 --> 32:59.165
Did you tell anyone about me?

32:59.210 --> 33:01.201
Or did you just
rush right down to grandstand?

33:01.240 --> 33:03.629
Oh, I e-mailed
several colleagues...
No, you didn't.

33:03.680 --> 33:05.409
We're gonna be
at Mr. Fowkes'

33:05.450 --> 33:07.338
country estate in a
couple of minutes.

33:07.380 --> 33:11.544
In a week or two, after somebody
calls in an anonymous tip,

33:11.590 --> 33:13.239
the police are going to find

33:13.290 --> 33:15.713
your body buried
on the property.

33:15.760 --> 33:17.557
And then everyone will know
that you were right

33:17.590 --> 33:21.697
and that Mr. Fowkes killed
you before you could prove it.

33:21.730 --> 33:23.595
You're gonna frame your boss.

33:23.630 --> 33:26.497
Daniel Cho is gonna
get that promotion.

33:26.530 --> 33:29.795
I imagine he'll need an
experienced executive secretary

33:29.840 --> 33:32.365
to watch his back
as he rises to the top.

33:32.410 --> 33:34.605
Hmm, I was
wrong about you.

33:34.640 --> 33:36.699
You are smart.

33:36.740 --> 33:39.072
Oh, that's quite a compliment
coming from you.

33:39.110 --> 33:42.147
Canon-Ebersole should make you
the managing director.

33:42.180 --> 33:45.286
They don't have the imagination
for that kind of move.

33:46.690 --> 33:49.158
(phone chimes)

33:49.190 --> 33:52.250
"Joan." That's the woman that
you're always With, right?

33:52.290 --> 33:55.396
That's the fifth time she texted
in the last 20 minutes.

33:55.430 --> 33:56.727
She won't stop, you know.

33:56.760 --> 33:58.694
Very high-strung.

33:58.730 --> 34:01.164
I wouldn't be surprised
if she gets the police involved.

34:01.200 --> 34:03.088
Well, in that case,
we should let her know

34:03.140 --> 34:06.109
that everything's okay.

34:06.140 --> 34:07.767
(pushes buttons on phone)

34:07.810 --> 34:09.175
I'm a sober companion.

34:09.210 --> 34:10.837
I work with recovering
drug addicts.

34:10.880 --> 34:12.347
Sherlock is my client.

34:12.380 --> 34:14.371
His father hired me
to help him stay clean.

34:14.420 --> 34:16.615
The only reason
I am telling you this

34:16.650 --> 34:18.083
is because I think
he may have relapsed.

34:18.120 --> 34:19.781
I need your help to find him.

34:19.820 --> 34:21.515
What makes you
think he relapsed?

34:21.560 --> 34:24.358
The heroin from the crime scene
the other day.

34:24.390 --> 34:25.527
It affected him.

34:25.560 --> 34:27.528
I think it brought
some things back.

34:29.430 --> 34:31.523
(phone chimes)

34:31.570 --> 34:33.595
It's Sherlock.

34:33.630 --> 34:36.269
He says he's fine,
he's heading back.

34:36.300 --> 34:38.530
See? There you go.

34:38.570 --> 34:39.867
Nothing to
worry about.

34:39.910 --> 34:41.639
"See you soon."

34:42.840 --> 34:44.671
HOLMES:
No, seriously?

34:44.710 --> 34:47.201
You honestly expect me
to dig my own grave?

34:47.250 --> 34:49.275
Have you ever
been gut-shot?

34:49.320 --> 34:53.245
No. I imagine it makes it
difficult to do manual labor.

34:53.290 --> 34:55.815
Shoot me, yank my fingernails
out-- the answer's still no.

34:55.860 --> 34:57.555
I categorically refuse
to dig a hole for you

34:57.590 --> 34:58.818
to bury me in, sorry.

34:58.860 --> 35:00.623
DO_NNA:
Fine.

35:00.660 --> 35:02.696
I'll do it myself.

35:02.730 --> 35:04.288
It's not supposed
to be that deep.

35:04.330 --> 35:07.197
They're supposed
to find you.

35:07.230 --> 35:09.198
Tell me something.

35:09.240 --> 35:11.299
How did you get started
With all this?

35:11.340 --> 35:14.309
You must be very proud
of your projects.

35:14.340 --> 35:17.605
It must kill you to have to
keep it all to yourself, hmm?

35:17.640 --> 35:20.700
I-I'm about to die, so
now's your chance to share.

35:20.750 --> 35:24.311
Good to share, yeah.

35:24.350 --> 35:25.886
Tell me.

35:25.920 --> 35:28.582
What launched the career
of Donna Kaplan,

35:28.620 --> 35:30.178
corporate sociopath?

35:30.220 --> 35:32.484
Mr. Fowkes was a bonds salesman
back in Denver,

35:32.530 --> 35:35.192
the company was downsizing.

35:35.230 --> 35:36.925
They were either going
to cut his job...

35:36.960 --> 35:38.222
(siren chirps)

35:38.270 --> 35:40.465
What are they doing here?

35:40.500 --> 35:42.661
HOLMES:
I'm not really sure.

35:42.700 --> 35:44.509
Bought me some
time, though.

35:44.540 --> 35:46.337
Did you know I pick locks?

35:46.370 --> 35:48.406
(stun gun zapping)
Pockets, too.

35:54.450 --> 35:56.543
(indistinct radio transmission)

35:56.580 --> 35:59.219
I can't take a tranquilizer, but
if it's not too much trouble,

35:59.250 --> 36:01.514
I'd love ten minutes
hooked up to your oxygen rig.

36:04.560 --> 36:06.448
I'll just help myself then.

36:06.490 --> 36:09.220
There's plenty of oxygen
out here, you know.

36:09.260 --> 36:10.921
Pure stuff's better.

36:10.960 --> 36:12.860
It invigorates and restores.

36:12.900 --> 36:14.891
Haven't you heard?
I've been through a trauma.

36:17.940 --> 36:21.205
That was, uh, very convenient

36:21.240 --> 36:23.708
the local police showing up
When they did.

36:23.740 --> 36:26.470
Too convenient
to be a c0inCIdence.

36:26.510 --> 36:28.842
It was the text message
that Donna sent

36:28.880 --> 36:30.347
from my phone, wasn't it?

36:30.380 --> 36:32.848
"Everything's fine.
Phone was off.

36:32.890 --> 36:35.415
My mistake. See you soon."
That's it.

36:35.460 --> 36:38.258
No emoticons,
no indecipherable acronyms.

36:38.290 --> 36:41.521
It didn't read
like a teenager on a sugar high.

36:41.560 --> 36:43.699
Which meant you didn't write it.

36:43.730 --> 36:46.528
I manipulated her
into writing it for me.

36:46.570 --> 36:48.663
I knew she'd never be able
to duplicate my flair

36:48.700 --> 36:51.533
for our evolving mother tongue.

36:51.570 --> 36:54.403
I also knew...
I-I hoped

36:54.440 --> 36:56.374
that once you realized
the message wasn't from me,

36:56.410 --> 36:59.402
you'd know I was in trouble.

37:00.710 --> 37:02.541
From there, it's relatively
simple for the police

37:02.580 --> 37:05.287
to run a cellular interceptor
on my phone,

37:05.320 --> 37:07.288
find my location, quick call
to the local authorities...

37:07.320 --> 37:08.856
I'm sorry, are you trying
to take credit

37:08.890 --> 37:10.619
for the fact
that I saved your life?

37:12.460 --> 37:15.258
And so soon after you
promoted me to bodyguard.

37:15.300 --> 37:17.256
It was a
collaboration.

37:17.300 --> 37:19.860
Well done, Watson.

37:22.370 --> 37:25.931
Your deductive skills are not
unworthy of further development.

37:25.970 --> 37:30.430
I think that was a compliment,
buried in a double negative,

37:30.480 --> 37:32.698
so... thanks.

37:32.750 --> 37:34.570
MAN :
Detective?

37:34.620 --> 37:36.474
(indistinct,
overlapping chatter)

37:36.520 --> 37:38.317
Look, you should know,

37:38.350 --> 37:40.818
I went to Captain Gregson
When I couldn't find you.

37:40.850 --> 37:42.852
I had to...

37:42.890 --> 37:45.859
explain some things to him.

37:50.030 --> 37:52.669
I'm sorry.

37:54.900 --> 37:57.664
You might want to have a talk
With him.

38:04.710 --> 38:05.847
(knocking)

38:05.880 --> 38:07.643
Come in.

38:12.650 --> 38:14.959
(sighs heavily)

38:16.120 --> 38:18.350
You know... (clears throat)

38:18.390 --> 38:19.926
You were busy
at Jim Fowkes' house,

38:19.960 --> 38:22.599
and I didn't get a chance
to pull you aside.

38:22.630 --> 38:26.020
_ But I didn't want to _let more
time pass Without haVIng a word.

38:26.070 --> 38:28.698
We have something to talk about?

38:30.740 --> 38:33.038
There are any number of reasons

38:33.070 --> 38:35.709
Why I didn't tell you
about my history.

38:35.740 --> 38:39.107
Um... I've told myself dozens,

38:39.150 --> 38:42.540
all of them specious.

38:47.450 --> 38:50.715
In the end, um,
it... it is simple.

38:50.760 --> 38:53.081
Uh, I was... I was...
I was embarrassed.

38:57.130 --> 38:59.997
Since we first collaborated,

39:00.030 --> 39:02.931
you've always held me
and my work in a certain esteem.

39:05.440 --> 39:09.069
I guess I'm-I'm... I'm, uh...
I'm m-more vain about that

39:09.110 --> 39:11.670
than I would care to admit.

39:14.580 --> 39:16.775
So, I'm sorry, 'cause you...

39:16.820 --> 39:19.482
you deserved to know.

39:19.520 --> 39:21.408
I did know.

39:21.460 --> 39:23.087
I beg your pardon?

39:23.120 --> 39:25.657
Do you honestly think
I'd let you consult

39:25.690 --> 39:28.693
for the NYPD
Without doing my homework?

39:28.730 --> 39:32.393
You told me Joan was
your personal valet.

39:32.430 --> 39:34.830
Do you think I'm an idiot?

39:34.870 --> 39:37.088
No.

39:37.140 --> 39:39.108
You are above average
in intelligence.

39:39.140 --> 39:42.439
And for a policeman,
I would say, top tier.

39:42.480 --> 39:45.074
I've known about your
problem for a while now.

39:45.110 --> 39:46.839
Why didn't you say anything?

39:46.880 --> 39:49.178
I did, sort of.

39:49.220 --> 39:51.848
A while back,
I asked you out for a drink.

39:51.890 --> 39:54.450
You said, "No."

39:54.490 --> 39:56.048
I figured you'd talk about it

39:56.090 --> 39:58.581
When you were ready
to talk about it.

39:58.630 --> 40:01.121
Was I happy
that you didn't tell me?

40:01.160 --> 40:03.720
No.

40:05.030 --> 40:07.999
(sighs)

40:08.030 --> 40:13.002
But your work hasn't slipped
one bit since Scotland Yard.

40:15.640 --> 40:18.541
Thank you.

40:18.580 --> 40:21.469
Well, not everyone

40:21.520 --> 40:23.579
is gonna see it
my way, so,

40:23.620 --> 40:25.986
I'm gonna do us both a favor

40:26.020 --> 40:28.909
and keep a lid on this.

40:48.070 --> 40:50.630
(phone chimes)

40:53.610 --> 40:55.510
Unbelievable.

40:55.550 --> 40:57.848
What is?

40:57.880 --> 41:00.519
It's just that green
card marriage guy.

41:00.550 --> 41:02.711
Emily's having this dinner party
thing next week,

41:02.760 --> 41:05.081
and we talked
about maybe going together,

41:05.130 --> 41:07.690
and I think now
he's blowing me off.

41:07.730 --> 41:10.096
But you know What
the irony is?

41:10.130 --> 41:13.520
I don‘t even want to be in a
relationship right now. I...

41:13.570 --> 41:15.788
It's just that Emily
went to so much trouble.

41:15.840 --> 41:18.832
Yet his apparent
mutual disinterest irks you.

41:18.870 --> 41:21.668
It's crazy, I know.

41:21.710 --> 41:25.976
IfI had to guess, and by
sitting there talking about it--

41:26.010 --> 41:27.978
you're forcing me to--
I would say

41:28.010 --> 41:30.274
he finds your analytical
skills intimidating.

41:30.320 --> 41:31.810
He was a little weirded out

41:31.850 --> 41:33.943
When I told him
I looked him up online,

41:33.990 --> 41:36.811
but he lied about being married,
so we are square, right?

41:36.860 --> 41:39.522
He might not see it that way.
Doesn't, apparently.

41:41.630 --> 41:43.996
It has its costs.

41:44.030 --> 41:46.123
What does?

41:46.170 --> 41:49.139
Learning to see the puzzle
in everything.

41:49.170 --> 41:51.297
They're everywhere.

41:51.340 --> 41:54.605
Once you start looking,
it's impossible to stop.

41:56.310 --> 41:59.143
It just so happens
that people,

41:59.180 --> 42:01.717
and all the deceits
and delusions

42:01.750 --> 42:04.719
that inform
everything they do,

42:04.750 --> 42:06.843
tend _to be the most
fascmating puzzles of all.

42:06.890 --> 42:09.859
Of course,

42:09.890 --> 42:12.552
they don't always appreciate
being seen as such.

42:14.260 --> 42:17.559
Seems like a lonely way to live.

42:18.800 --> 42:22.964
As I said, it has its costs.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.968
