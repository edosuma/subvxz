- Hi, Rich.
- Hi, Al.

01:45.272 --> 01:46.316
My girl.

01:46.340 --> 01:48.351
Ah. She's so charitable.

01:48.375 --> 01:50.186
She's taking an extra turn, huh?

01:50.210 --> 01:52.522
No, no, she's-she's been
in the booth all night.

01:52.546 --> 01:53.923
She never left it.

01:55.783 --> 01:58.561
- She never left?
- No.

01:58.585 --> 02:00.363
Look, it's for charity.

02:00.387 --> 02:02.565
It's for the March of Dimes.

02:02.589 --> 02:03.967
It's a sacrifice.

02:03.991 --> 02:06.736
RICHIE:
She never left?

02:06.760 --> 02:08.762
All right, that's it!

02:17.671 --> 02:20.250
All right, all right,
break it up!

02:20.274 --> 02:21.818
Bucko!

02:21.842 --> 02:23.887
- Hey, come on.
-(men grumbling)

02:23.911 --> 02:25.422
Hey, hey, just... time out.
Time out.

02:25.446 --> 02:26.656
Easy, here, will you? Please.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.258
Rich, what is with you?

02:28.282 --> 02:30.060
What's with me?
What's with you?

02:30.084 --> 02:32.655
This is a kissing booth, bucko.

02:33.787 --> 02:35.665
Step out here, Ms. Allen.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.200
Mrs. Potts, I'm taking a break.

02:37.224 --> 02:39.335
- RICHIE: She's taking
a break. -LORI BETH: Al.

02:39.359 --> 02:41.671
- Uh-huh.
- What's the matter?

02:41.695 --> 02:43.339
ALFRED:
And now, introducing

02:43.363 --> 02:45.842
the fresh lips
of Jennifer Jerome!

02:45.866 --> 02:47.868
- Ooh.
- Yeah, all right.

02:51.105 --> 02:52.916
Would you tell me
what's the matter?

02:52.940 --> 02:54.250
I'll tell you what's the matter.

02:54.274 --> 02:56.481
I'm a little upset
at your loose lips.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.890
I have loose lips?

03:00.914 --> 03:04.861
Yeah, and they weren't that
loose on our date last night.

03:04.885 --> 03:07.230
What date?
We spent the whole evening

03:07.254 --> 03:09.399
on a basketball court,
and I rebounded.

03:09.423 --> 03:12.068
Come on, I like to shoot a few.
It was fun.

03:12.092 --> 03:14.237
I was wearing a velvet dress.

03:14.261 --> 03:16.005
And you looked good.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.774
Tonight we're
going out to dinner.

03:17.798 --> 03:20.110
Tonight I'm dressed
for basketball.

03:20.134 --> 03:21.478
All right, fine,
we'll shoot some foul shots

03:21.502 --> 03:22.712
before we go to dinner.

03:22.736 --> 03:26.015
Loose Lips doesn't care
about foul shots.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.041
Go foul yourself!

03:30.644 --> 03:33.591
Go foul myself?

03:35.149 --> 03:37.994
You can't foul yourself.

03:38.018 --> 03:40.430
Al, the girl knows nothing
at all about basketball.

03:40.454 --> 03:44.061
Lori Beth,
you cannot foul yourself!

03:51.365 --> 03:53.710
Chachi, Chachi, Chachi.

03:53.734 --> 03:56.079
What? Who Chachi?
Where Chachi?

03:56.103 --> 03:58.248
Oh, Chachi. That handsome kid?

03:58.272 --> 03:59.449
He just left.

03:59.473 --> 04:01.484
I'm busy supporting
the March of Dimes.

04:01.508 --> 04:03.486
Oh, no, no more for you.

04:03.510 --> 04:06.055
You already made two girls quit.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.858
It wasn't my fault, Al.
They were amateurs.

04:08.882 --> 04:11.261
But me-- wah, wah, wah. (laughs)

04:11.285 --> 04:12.896
Oh, that's it, that's it,
you had enough.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.864
- One for the road, Al?
- No!

04:14.888 --> 04:16.161
I'll buy you one.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.302
Oh, come on, get out.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.273
(Snaps fingers)

04:37.744 --> 04:39.746
Whoa!

04:47.588 --> 04:50.834
My snap knows no age limit.

04:50.858 --> 04:52.502
Later, girls.

04:52.526 --> 04:55.972
All right, Pots,
the kissing booth.

04:55.996 --> 04:58.842
I've been rubbing my lips
with olive oil all day.

04:58.866 --> 05:00.812
They're limber and ready to go.

05:02.169 --> 05:04.881
POTSIE: That's Jennifer Jerome,
the Georgia peach.

05:04.905 --> 05:06.983
Yeah, the Southern belle.

05:07.007 --> 05:09.152
(imitating bell):
Bong, bong!

05:09.176 --> 05:11.521
Come on, there's Fonz.

05:11.545 --> 05:12.922
Right, right.

05:12.946 --> 05:15.258
Hey, Fonz, big doings, huh?

05:15.282 --> 05:17.260
(sniffs)
What's wrong with you, Malph?

05:17.284 --> 05:18.661
You smell like a salad.

05:19.753 --> 05:23.032
Pots, I told you
that olive oil was stupid.

05:23.056 --> 05:24.634
Look at that Jennifer.

05:24.658 --> 05:27.070
What a cupcake.

05:27.094 --> 05:28.171
Come on, Pots,
let's get in line.

05:28.195 --> 05:30.740
Oh, I can't, Malph. I'm afraid.

05:30.764 --> 05:33.543
Of girls? (laughs)

05:33.567 --> 05:35.879
Just Jennifer.
She's too beautiful.

05:35.903 --> 05:38.982
Well, maybe she has
an ugly sister. (chuckles)

05:39.006 --> 05:41.284
No, it's not...
it's not that, Malph.

05:41.308 --> 05:42.819
Jennifer's special.

05:42.843 --> 05:46.422
Ever since she walked in biology
class, I've been crazy over her.

05:46.446 --> 05:48.491
Ah, she'd never go out
with a guy like me.

05:48.515 --> 05:49.893
He's got us there.

05:49.917 --> 05:52.929
For every man, there is a woman.

05:52.953 --> 05:56.432
Now, for some of us,
there are several. Aaayyh.

05:56.456 --> 05:57.634
(Snaps fingers)

05:57.658 --> 06:00.935
Just get up, get on the line,
get over there.

06:02.229 --> 06:04.231
Go, go.

06:07.234 --> 06:09.236
(chuckles)

06:10.804 --> 06:12.048
It's here someplace.

06:12.072 --> 06:14.484
You can owe me.

06:26.520 --> 06:27.964
I'm almost done here.

06:27.988 --> 06:29.968
Would you like to do
something afterwards?

06:32.993 --> 06:35.132
I'll meet you outside.

06:40.267 --> 06:42.578
Al, she likes me.

06:42.602 --> 06:44.604
She's gonna meet me outside.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.250
What happened, Fonz?

06:47.274 --> 06:49.185
Jennifer went nuts over Potsie.

06:49.209 --> 06:51.587
Hey, Malph, never question love.

06:51.611 --> 06:52.588
I'm amazed.

06:52.612 --> 06:53.589
Ditto.

06:53.613 --> 06:55.758
That's a good idea. Fine.

06:55.782 --> 06:57.293
Ladies and gentlemen,

06:57.317 --> 07:00.797
one of Milwaukee's
greatest kissers is sitting

07:00.821 --> 07:02.265
right in our audience
here tonight.

07:02.289 --> 07:04.033
And, I think, with
a little encouragement,

07:04.057 --> 07:06.536
we could get him to come up
to the kissing booth, huh?

07:06.560 --> 07:08.972
Let's hear it for the Fonz!

07:08.996 --> 07:10.974
(cheering, applause)

07:10.998 --> 07:13.000
All right, all right.

07:16.570 --> 07:21.250
I only regret that I've got
but two lips to give to charity.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.276
All right, who's next?

07:29.049 --> 07:31.027
Lori Beth, I-l was
just joking around

07:31.051 --> 07:32.655
when I called you Loose Lips.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.798
No, really, uh...

07:35.822 --> 07:37.700
Well, you know me,
I'm always joshing.

07:37.724 --> 07:39.670
(chuckles)

07:41.695 --> 07:44.107
Well, you love the other
nickname I have for you.

07:44.131 --> 07:46.133
You love it when I call you
Sweet Knees!

07:48.335 --> 07:49.712
Sweet Knees.

07:49.736 --> 07:51.214
(laughs)

07:51.238 --> 07:55.018
Quiet, dear. Let your brother
fight with his girl in peace.

07:55.042 --> 07:56.886
Lori Beth, you're being
absolutely ri...

07:56.910 --> 07:58.912
(line clicks, static hums)

08:02.582 --> 08:04.584
She didn't hang up on me.

08:06.620 --> 08:09.799
She yanked the cord
out of the wall.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.567
That's all right, dear.

08:11.591 --> 08:12.802
You could always write.

08:12.826 --> 08:16.039
All right, Joanie,
let's do the vocabulary.

08:16.063 --> 08:17.206
House.

08:17.230 --> 08:18.508
Uh, casa.

08:18.532 --> 08:19.942
<i>Azul.</i>

08:19.966 --> 08:20.977
Blue.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.945
- Brother.
- Richie?

08:22.969 --> 08:24.347
Oh, oh, uh, hermano.

08:24.371 --> 08:26.516
(doorbell rings)

08:26.540 --> 08:29.384
Get the door, sefior.

08:31.378 --> 08:33.188
Yeah. (laughs)

08:33.212 --> 08:36.692
That was a good one, Dad.

08:36.716 --> 08:39.629
All right, everybody,
have I got news for you.

08:39.653 --> 08:42.597
(laughs)

08:42.621 --> 08:45.868
You got to hear this one,
Howie. Cute, cute.

08:45.892 --> 08:47.270
Folks, you're gonna love this.

08:47.294 --> 08:49.005
(laughs)

08:49.029 --> 08:51.441
Rich, wait till you
hear this one. (chuckles)

08:51.465 --> 08:53.209
It's Potsie and
Jennifer Jerome--

08:53.233 --> 08:55.978
he's only had one date with
the girl, and he's gonna ask her

08:56.002 --> 08:58.281
to marry him. (laughs)

08:58.305 --> 09:00.850
That must be some date.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.151
Yeah.

09:02.175 --> 09:03.953
Married?
Potsie's getting married?

09:03.977 --> 09:06.122
- Yeah. -That's great,
he's getting married,

09:06.146 --> 09:08.057
Lori Beth won't even talk to me.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.692
Potsie's proposing.

09:09.716 --> 09:12.361
I know he's serious;
I saw him wash his ring finger.

09:12.385 --> 09:13.830
(chuckles)

09:13.854 --> 09:15.198
I Still got it.

09:15.222 --> 09:18.101
Well, I don't think
that's funny at all.

09:18.125 --> 09:19.435
Maybe it's my delivery.

09:19.459 --> 09:21.370
I know he's serious;
I saw him wash...

09:21.394 --> 09:24.807
No, no. Now, we-we have
got to talk him out of this

09:24.831 --> 09:26.576
before it's too late.

09:26.600 --> 09:27.944
This is kind of sudden.

09:27.968 --> 09:30.313
Has Potsie discussed this
with his father?

09:30.337 --> 09:31.814
Well, he would have,
but his dad won't even

09:31.838 --> 09:33.116
give him an appointment.

09:33.140 --> 09:35.118
Oh, poor Potsie.

09:35.142 --> 09:36.385
(clucks tongue) Warren.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.321
I really think
he should discuss this

09:38.345 --> 09:40.690
with some reasonable,
mature adult.

09:40.714 --> 09:41.886
Good thinking.

09:45.785 --> 09:47.964
Oh, no, no, not me.

09:47.988 --> 09:50.333
He's not my son,
it's not my place.

09:50.357 --> 09:54.070
You are a reasonable,
mature adult, dear.

09:54.094 --> 09:56.739
I am?

09:56.763 --> 10:00.510
Oh, Jiminy Cricket, I'll do it.

10:00.534 --> 10:03.743
Oh, good. Now just play
with your little boat, dear.

10:07.874 --> 10:09.152
ANNOUNCER:
It's a pop fly to Campbell,

10:09.176 --> 10:11.287
<i>and that's the third out.</i>

10:11.311 --> 10:12.655
ANNOUNCER 2:
So, after eight and a half,

10:12.679 --> 10:14.190
- Milwaukee Braves trail,
- POTSIE: Hi, Mr. C.

10:14.214 --> 10:15.887
- Three to one.
- POTSIE: Mr. C?

10:24.191 --> 10:25.902
Mr. C? (clears throat)

10:25.926 --> 10:27.637
Came by for a little talk.

10:27.661 --> 10:29.405
N ow?

10:29.429 --> 10:31.107
Am I interrupting?

10:31.131 --> 10:32.775
ANNOUNCER 2:
Leading off for the Braves,

10:32.799 --> 10:34.610
third baseman, Eddie Mathews.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.613
No, no, no, the Braves
have blown this one, Potsie.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.415
Let me just turn
the volume down.

10:39.439 --> 10:40.616
(turns down volume)

10:40.640 --> 10:42.985
That way, if anything happens,
I can see it.

10:43.009 --> 10:44.554
Well...

10:44.578 --> 10:46.022
tell me about this girl, huh?

10:46.046 --> 10:47.323
Aw.

10:47.347 --> 10:49.926
- Her name's Jennifer Jerome.
- Mm.

10:49.950 --> 10:52.728
It was love at first sight.

10:52.752 --> 10:55.932
She's the first girl that
really made me feel special.

10:55.956 --> 10:58.701
We laugh, we sing,

10:58.725 --> 11:01.399
we talk together,
you know what I mean?

11:05.131 --> 11:06.842
Sounds like a real find.

11:06.866 --> 11:09.039
Hey, look, Mathews got a hit.

11:10.937 --> 11:13.216
Mr. C, I want to marry her.

11:13.240 --> 11:16.485
Uh, Potsie,
I-l don't think marriage

11:16.509 --> 11:18.754
is the best thing
for you right now.

11:18.778 --> 11:20.257
Then we'll elope.

11:21.681 --> 11:24.260
No, no, look,
you shouldn't rush into this.

11:24.284 --> 11:27.029
You know, building
a relationship takes time.

11:27.053 --> 11:30.233
And pain. You know, like Richie
and his girl are going through?

11:30.257 --> 11:33.169
- Yeah. -No, it's not
all laughing and singing.

11:33.193 --> 11:36.472
You got to... you got
to learn to know each other.

11:36.496 --> 11:39.308
You should find out what
Jennifer's favorite flowers are,

11:39.332 --> 11:41.477
what kind of ice cream
she likes.

11:41.501 --> 11:42.712
Things like that.

11:42.736 --> 11:43.946
Right.

11:43.970 --> 11:45.414
Then I'll ask her to marry me.

11:45.438 --> 11:48.351
Hey, another hit;
they got two men on...

11:48.375 --> 11:50.987
Then you'll ask her
to marry you?

11:51.011 --> 11:52.888
(sighs)

11:52.912 --> 11:54.390
Isn't that the next step?

11:54.414 --> 11:56.259
No. No!

11:56.283 --> 11:58.527
There must be
other things you can do.

11:58.551 --> 12:01.731
Look, Potsie,
what I'm trying to say is...

12:01.755 --> 12:04.867
Well, ask her out for
a second date, you know?

12:04.891 --> 12:07.270
I mean, I'm sure there are
other things you can do

12:07.294 --> 12:09.505
besides proposing to her.

12:09.529 --> 12:12.074
- Look, you're in a fraternity,
right? -Yeah.

12:12.098 --> 12:13.809
Well, maybe you can get pinned.

12:13.833 --> 12:16.779
Yeah, pinned-- that's what
fraternity guys do, you know?

12:16.803 --> 12:19.482
Hey, Aaron's up. Come on, Hank.

12:19.506 --> 12:20.983
Getting pinned.

12:21.007 --> 12:23.009
I don't know, Mr. C,
that's pretty serious.

12:24.678 --> 12:27.723
<i>Serious'?
What do you think man'...</i>

12:27.747 --> 12:30.393
Look, Potsie,
I'm sure that Jennifer would

12:30.417 --> 12:32.728
much rather get pinned
than married.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.997
- Right, right.
- Mm.

12:35.021 --> 12:37.066
Pinned. Well, I won't...

12:37.090 --> 12:39.730
won't have to buy a ring,
I have a pin.

12:40.794 --> 12:42.405
Okay, Mr. C, I'll do it.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.073
You're doing the right thing,
Potsie.

12:44.097 --> 12:47.310
- And I'm sure glad
we had this little talk. -Oh.

12:47.334 --> 12:48.911
Hey, I really appreciate you
taking time with me, Mr. C.

12:48.935 --> 12:50.079
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna ask her tonight.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.247
- Good.
- Thanks.

12:51.271 --> 12:52.415
- Yeah.
- See you.

12:52.439 --> 12:53.416
Bye, Potsie.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.717
Hey, look at all the guys

12:54.741 --> 12:56.519
running around the bases.

12:56.543 --> 12:57.920
Guys running around the bases?

12:57.944 --> 12:59.689
ANNOUNCER: He's got a homer,
ladies and gentlemen!

12:59.713 --> 13:00.890
It's out of the ballpark!

13:00.914 --> 13:02.591
That ball must still be going!

13:02.615 --> 13:05.094
Now, that's the kind of homer
you don't see every day!

13:05.118 --> 13:06.195
(crowd cheering)

13:06.219 --> 13:08.221
I certainly didn't.

13:16.496 --> 13:19.208
JENNIFER: Oh, Potsie, thanks
for taking me to the carnival.

13:19.232 --> 13:22.304
POTSIE: Oh, thank you
for winning me the teddy bear.

13:23.670 --> 13:25.648
I'm really surprised
you went outwith me.

13:25.672 --> 13:28.217
You're always dating a football
player or some other athlete.

13:28.241 --> 13:30.019
No one else ever asks me out.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.520
No one ever...

13:31.544 --> 13:33.222
But you're so beautiful,
you're such a nice person.

13:33.246 --> 13:35.358
- I can't believe...
- You know what?

13:35.382 --> 13:37.126
I'm glad I asked you out.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.323
Me, too.

13:40.787 --> 13:43.799
Boy, we've been seeing a lot
of each other lately.

13:43.823 --> 13:46.035
Yeah, two nights in a row.

13:46.059 --> 13:48.537
Yeah, two nights.

13:48.561 --> 13:50.272
(chuckles)

13:50.296 --> 13:53.642
Jenny, what's your favorite
ice cream?

13:53.666 --> 13:56.212
Tutti Frutti.

13:56.236 --> 13:58.238
Mine, too.

13:59.239 --> 14:00.750
What's your favorite flower?

14:00.774 --> 14:02.084
Roses.

14:02.108 --> 14:04.110
Mine, too.

14:05.111 --> 14:07.156
Who's your favorite guy?

14:07.180 --> 14:08.157
You.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.092
Mine, too.

14:11.918 --> 14:13.729
Let's get pinned!

14:13.753 --> 14:15.531
- Pinned?
- You're right, I'm rushing it.

14:15.555 --> 14:17.333
Oh, no.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.135
Oh, no, Potsie.

14:19.159 --> 14:20.436
I'd love to get pinned.

14:20.460 --> 14:23.305
No kidding?

14:23.329 --> 14:25.307
Oh, Jenny.

14:25.331 --> 14:27.333
Excuse me, Teddy.

14:37.911 --> 14:39.913
I got pinned!

14:41.614 --> 14:42.825
I got pinned!

14:42.849 --> 14:45.561
Oh, you got pinned?
All right, Pots!

14:45.585 --> 14:46.896
- Oh, good.
- All right!

14:46.920 --> 14:48.564
- Congratulations.
- All right, Pots.

14:48.588 --> 14:50.299
- Thanks. Thanks. Thanks.
- Congratulations.

14:50.323 --> 14:52.435
- Congratulations, Potsie.
- Aw. Mmm.

14:52.459 --> 14:54.103
What's this,
another kissing booth?

14:54.127 --> 14:55.504
No. No, we-we discussed it.

14:55.528 --> 14:57.339
- That's a charity-type kiss.
- Oh.

14:57.363 --> 14:58.607
Come on, we better go in.

14:58.631 --> 15:00.109
It's almost bed-check time.

15:00.133 --> 15:03.012
I want you to tell me
all about it.

15:03.036 --> 15:05.014
Good night, Potsie. Thanks.

15:05.038 --> 15:07.316
Talk to you in the morning.

15:07.340 --> 15:08.918
In the morning.

15:08.942 --> 15:10.586
-(chuckles)
- Mmm.

15:10.610 --> 15:12.612
In the morning.

15:13.713 --> 15:15.658
Two?! Two?!

15:15.682 --> 15:17.326
I thought we discussed this!

15:17.350 --> 15:18.594
I thought we worked this out.

15:18.618 --> 15:19.795
Will you get off it?

15:19.819 --> 15:21.230
I'm just excited for Jenny.

15:21.254 --> 15:22.765
Me get off it? Me?

15:22.789 --> 15:24.967
We'll talk about it
in the morning.

15:24.991 --> 15:26.635
We'll talk about it now!

15:26.659 --> 15:29.538
We'll talk about it
in the morning!

15:34.734 --> 15:37.442
We're gonna talk about this
in the morning.

15:39.372 --> 15:41.909
Congratulations.

15:44.344 --> 15:47.623
This has been an evening
I'll never forget, Fred.

15:47.647 --> 15:49.625
Fred?

15:49.649 --> 15:51.494
My name's Ralph.

15:51.518 --> 15:54.363
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm no good with names.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.833
But I had a real nice time.

15:57.924 --> 15:59.926
You got to remember Ralph!

16:01.294 --> 16:03.296
Great bod, bad mind.

16:05.031 --> 16:07.637
WOMAN:
10:30, girls! Curfew!

16:14.340 --> 16:17.052
Well, at least
the housemother knows my name.

16:17.076 --> 16:20.222
She said, "Get out, Ralph!"

16:20.246 --> 16:23.392
Malph, isn't that great?
Jennifer said yes.

16:23.416 --> 16:25.861
Potsie and Jennifer. Boy.

16:25.885 --> 16:28.097
I can't wait
until the pinning ceremony.

16:28.121 --> 16:30.032
Are we gonna have fun!

16:30.056 --> 16:31.634
Food, drink, dancing.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.269
- You get to sing, Pots.
- Yeah.

16:33.293 --> 16:35.204
Then they take you down
to Duffy's Pier

16:35.228 --> 16:36.839
and throw you right in the lake.

16:36.863 --> 16:38.807
It's great. College fun.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.242
(chuckles):
Right.

16:40.266 --> 16:41.977
All your fraternity brothers
will be right there with you.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.345
- You bet.
- No, you won't.

16:43.369 --> 16:45.014
I'm not getting pinned.

16:45.038 --> 16:46.615
You just said you were.

16:46.639 --> 16:48.717
Well, I'm not going through
with it.

16:48.741 --> 16:50.519
Potsie!

16:50.543 --> 16:52.521
Is everybody going nuts
around here? I...

16:52.545 --> 16:53.923
Pots?!

16:53.947 --> 16:55.624
You think
we should go after him?

16:55.648 --> 16:57.626
Yeah, with a net.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.361
My delivery's off again.

16:59.385 --> 17:01.991
Yeah, with a net!

17:14.901 --> 17:17.313
Come on, Fonz,
can't you talk to him?

17:17.337 --> 17:18.881
Yeah, he hasn't been
this depressed

17:18.905 --> 17:20.816
since Howdy <i>Doody</i>
went off the air.

17:20.839 --> 17:22.550
Hey, I...

17:22.575 --> 17:24.286
I know how he feels, you know?

17:24.310 --> 17:25.487
That's a terrible thing.

17:25.511 --> 17:27.522
Clarabell.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.858
How can you ask me
to talk to a man

17:29.882 --> 17:33.562
that gets pinned and unpinned,
all in four minutes?

17:33.586 --> 17:36.198
Oh, Fonz, can't you try?

17:36.222 --> 17:38.634
I mean, you're a man who...
who is an oasis

17:38.658 --> 17:39.935
in a desert of despair.

17:39.959 --> 17:41.337
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

17:41.361 --> 17:42.805
A man who helps total strangers

17:42.829 --> 17:44.831
can't help
one of his best friends?

17:46.032 --> 17:48.477
All right, all right.
Strong acquaintance.

17:48.501 --> 17:50.346
I like that.

17:50.370 --> 17:52.047
Oasis... in a desert of despair.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.414
Right.

17:55.608 --> 17:58.287
Okay, Mr. Weber, here you have
a private counsel,

17:58.311 --> 17:59.488
right, private audience?

17:59.512 --> 18:00.789
Now, what is the problem?

18:00.813 --> 18:02.191
You really want to know?

18:02.215 --> 18:03.492
Yeah, I want to know.

18:03.516 --> 18:05.694
Aw, first Mr. C and then you.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.830
I didn't realize
I had so many friends.

18:07.854 --> 18:10.926
Neither did I,
but let's hear the problem.

18:11.958 --> 18:13.403
I can't swim.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.774
You can't swim?

18:18.798 --> 18:22.011
You're telling me
you can't swim?

18:22.035 --> 18:23.812
You better not be joshing

18:23.836 --> 18:26.181
the oasis in the desert
of despair here.

18:26.205 --> 18:28.450
Fonz, I can't even dog-paddle.

18:28.474 --> 18:30.647
What do you think Jennifer is,
a tuna?

18:32.612 --> 18:35.286
Fonz, after the ceremony,
they throw you in the lake.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.360
I could drown
right in front of Jennifer!

18:38.384 --> 18:39.995
Do you know
how embarrassed she'd be?!

18:40.019 --> 18:41.797
Will you stop talking so crazy.

18:41.821 --> 18:43.365
You're not gonna drown.

18:43.389 --> 18:44.633
- I'm not?
- No.

18:44.657 --> 18:47.036
- How you gonna do that?
- Hey, trust me.

18:47.060 --> 18:48.671
Oh, I trust you, Fonz.

18:48.695 --> 18:50.773
But I'd trust you more
if you told me.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.408
You're gonna lose
half your friends.

18:52.432 --> 18:54.209
Right, right, right.

18:54.233 --> 18:55.678
Fonz?

18:55.702 --> 18:58.047
Now I know why
people travel miles to see you.

18:58.071 --> 19:00.278
- Thanks.
- Whoa.

19:01.407 --> 19:03.318
If I keep hearing confessions
like this,

19:03.342 --> 19:06.346
I'm gonna have to start
wearing a white collar.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.161
Hey, I got lucky.

19:12.185 --> 19:14.396
- Fonz?
- Whoa!

19:14.420 --> 19:16.098
- Oh, Pots looks a lot happier.
- Yeah.

19:16.122 --> 19:17.566
Yeah, you really
came through again.

19:17.590 --> 19:19.268
You helped out another person.

19:19.292 --> 19:20.536
I'm an oasis.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.562
Yeah.

19:23.563 --> 19:26.308
Fonz?

19:26.332 --> 19:30.012
What would you say if, uh,
a guy had a very special girl.

19:30.036 --> 19:32.881
All of a sudden, this girl
pops up in a kissing booth.

19:32.905 --> 19:35.250
Now, she really acts like
she's enjoying it, Fonz.

19:35.274 --> 19:37.019
You know, kiss, kiss, kiss.

19:37.043 --> 19:38.320
It's really bothering me, Fonz.

19:38.344 --> 19:39.846
What would you say about that?

19:46.619 --> 19:48.864
No, no, this is Potsie
and Jennifer's big moment,

19:48.888 --> 19:50.866
so we're gonna
call a truce, right?

19:50.890 --> 19:52.201
- Right, truce.
- Right.

19:52.225 --> 19:54.203
Aw, the bumpy road of love.

19:54.227 --> 19:55.804
But not ours, baby.

19:55.828 --> 19:57.573
It's smooth sailing,
right, Louise?

19:57.597 --> 19:59.174
Right, Dennis.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.676
Dennis?

20:00.700 --> 20:02.211
She's a kidder!

20:02.235 --> 20:04.113
That is funny.

20:04.137 --> 20:06.215
So, when does
the ceremony start?

20:06.239 --> 20:08.717
Well, it starts as soon
as Potsie gets here.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.652
Uh, Fonzie's helping him
to get dressed.

20:10.676 --> 20:12.054
Help him?

20:12.078 --> 20:15.023
How do you help a guy who needs
a shoehorn to put on his socks?

20:15.047 --> 20:16.258
(laughter)

20:16.282 --> 20:18.393
POTSIE: Fonz, are you sure
this is gonna work?

20:18.417 --> 20:20.262
All right, now, Potsie,
don't get nuts on me.

20:20.286 --> 20:22.197
Look, just before
they throw you in the lake,

20:22.221 --> 20:24.466
to inflate it,
you press right about here.

20:24.490 --> 20:26.602
Suppose I can't reach you?

20:26.626 --> 20:28.337
Not my chest.

20:28.361 --> 20:30.005
- Look, go get dressed, right?
- Yeah.
