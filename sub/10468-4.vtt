WEBVTT

00:01.697 --> 00:03.525
SEE, MY PHILOSOPHY
TO PARENTING IS--

00:03.525 --> 00:05.744
YOU DON'T USE MOUNTAIN MOE'S LOG
CABIN ANYMORE, DO YOU?

00:05.744 --> 00:06.919
HELLO, THANK YOU,
THAT'S MY BAGEL.
GIVE IT BACK.

00:06.919 --> 00:08.791
MAKE ME.

00:08.791 --> 00:11.272
YOU SEE, MY PHILOSOPHY
TO PARENTING IS TO PARENT
AS YOU WOULD--

00:11.272 --> 00:12.751
OWEN, PLEASE, JUST--CLAUDIA, DO YOU MIND?

00:12.751 --> 00:14.362
I'M TRYING TO TALK
TO VICTOR HERE.

00:14.362 --> 00:16.625
YELL AT OWEN.
HE JUST STOLE
MY BREAKFAST.

00:16.625 --> 00:19.497
WHETHER IT'S WHAT THEY EAT
OR WHEN THEY GO TO BED

00:19.497 --> 00:23.023
OR WHAT THEIR LIMITS
MAY OR MAY NOT BE

00:23.023 --> 00:24.894
TO WHAT YOU WANT THEM
TO DO FOR HALLOWEEN.

00:24.894 --> 00:26.200
YOU MEAN WHAT I DON'T DO.

00:26.200 --> 00:27.592
WHAT YOU DON'T DO?

00:27.592 --> 00:29.638
THERE'S NO TRICK
OR TREATING THIS YEAR.

00:29.638 --> 00:32.075
IT'S NOT SAFE. ALL THAT
SHARP STUFF THEY BEEN
FINDING IN THE CANDY.

00:32.075 --> 00:33.903
OWEN,
GET YOUR OWN BAGEL.

00:33.903 --> 00:35.339
BAILEY, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO

00:35.339 --> 00:37.080
IS JUST, LIKE, CHECK
HIS CANDY FOR SHARP STUFF.

00:37.080 --> 00:38.995
OR THERE'S PLENTY
OF FUN STUFF WE CAN
DO HERE AT HOME.

00:38.995 --> 00:40.127
LIKE WHAT?

00:40.127 --> 00:41.867
UH, LIKE MAKE

00:41.867 --> 00:43.956
I DO IT ALL THE TIME.
I HAVE HALF THE PROPS

00:43.956 --> 00:45.567
HAUNTED HOUSE, COOL.

00:45.567 --> 00:48.265
CAN WE? CAN WE?OWEN, NO. I'M SORRY.

00:48.265 --> 00:50.485
I GOTTA TRY TO CLEAN
THIS PLACE UP FOR SARAH,
OK?

00:50.485 --> 00:52.748
MY GIRLFRIEND'S COMING
BACK FROM NEW YORK
ANY DAY NOW AND--

00:52.748 --> 00:54.750
[TELEPHONE RINGS]THAT COULD BE HER NOW.

00:54.750 --> 00:56.882
HELLO?
OH, HI. HI, LES.

00:56.882 --> 00:58.275

I GOTTA GET HER FLIGHT--

00:58.275 --> 00:59.711
I'M SORRY,
I COULDN'T HEAR YOU.

00:59.711 --> 01:01.931
YOU COULDN'T HEAR?
WHY, DID YOU GET A BEEP?

01:01.931 --> 01:04.847
SO, WE HAVEN'T BEEN
INTRODUCED YET.

01:04.847 --> 01:07.154
I'M VICTOR.THAT'S OK.

01:07.154 --> 01:10.983
NONE OF THE NANNIES LAST MORE
THAN A COUPLE OF DAYS.

01:10.983 --> 01:12.855
HEY, IF SARAH CLICKS IN,
TELL HER SHE CAN CALL ME
ON MY CELL.

01:12.855 --> 01:14.161
BAILEY, LEAVE ME ALONE.

01:14.161 --> 01:15.510
Bailey:
CLAUDIA, DID YOU HEAR ME?

01:15.510 --> 01:16.859
CLAUDIA, NOD IF YOU HEARD ME.

01:16.859 --> 01:18.817

01:59.641 --> 02:01.077
IT'S TOO MUCH TOO SOON.

02:01.077 --> 02:02.774
I'M ESTABLISHING
A CHARACTER.

02:02.774 --> 02:04.385
YOU KNOW, WATCHING
SOMEBODY SLOWLY UNDRESS

02:04.385 --> 02:06.038
IS FAR MORE PROVOCATIVE

02:06.038 --> 02:08.389
THAN SEEING THEM
ALREADY NAKED.

02:10.913 --> 02:12.915
SOMEONE WROTE THAT
SENTENCE, YOU KNOW?

02:12.915 --> 02:15.831

MAYBE THAT'S WHAT'S
BOTHERING ME.

02:25.449 --> 02:27.059
IT'S LIKE WE'RE
NOT EVEN HERE,

02:27.059 --> 02:28.539
JUST THE WORK
IS HERE.

02:28.539 --> 02:31.673
WITH YOU AND
THAT RED PENCIL
DRAWING THESE...

02:31.673 --> 02:33.109
THESE LINES.

02:33.109 --> 02:35.851
JULIA, I'VE GOT
A DEADLINE ON THIS.

02:35.851 --> 02:38.158
WELL, THAT DOESN'T MEAN
WE CAN'T INTERACT
LIKE HUMANS,

02:38.158 --> 02:39.942
SHARE A PLEASANTRY
ONCE IN A WHILE,

02:39.942 --> 02:41.944
MAYBE GET A HOT DOG,
OR I DON'T KNOW--

02:41.944 --> 02:43.598
TELL A JOKE.

02:43.598 --> 02:47.602
A JOKE.
YOU WANNA SHARE A JOKE?

02:47.602 --> 02:49.256
SURE. WHY NOT?

02:49.256 --> 02:51.606
YOU KNOW,
I DON'T KNOW ANY JOKES.

02:51.606 --> 02:52.998
DO YOU?

02:55.479 --> 02:56.915
NOT REALLY, NO.

03:04.923 --> 03:06.490
[SIGHS]

03:06.490 --> 03:09.058
OWEN, HAS SARAH CALLED YET?

03:10.973 --> 03:12.627
[SIGHS] OK.

03:14.411 --> 03:18.241
UM...LISTEN,
I'LL CALL BACK LATER, OK?

03:18.241 --> 03:19.634
BYE.

03:21.462 --> 03:22.985
WILL?

03:24.769 --> 03:28.077
HEY, WILL, MAN.

03:28.077 --> 03:29.426
HEY, BAY.

03:29.426 --> 03:30.514
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
HERE?

03:30.514 --> 03:31.602
WHEN DID YOU GET
INTO TOWN?

03:31.602 --> 03:34.126
WHEN? UH, OH, A WHILE.

03:34.126 --> 03:35.954
A FEW WEEKS
OR MAYBE A MONTH.

03:35.954 --> 03:37.695
A MONTH?

03:37.695 --> 03:40.002
YEAH. I WAS GONNA CALL
AS SOON AS I SETTLED
INTO THIS JOB,

03:40.002 --> 03:41.177
BUT IT'S BEEN SO CRAZY.

03:41.177 --> 03:42.309
JOB? WHAT JOB?

03:42.309 --> 03:43.484
WHAT ABOUT SCHOOL?

03:43.484 --> 03:45.225
I TOOK A YEAR OFF.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.009
I MEAN, I'VE BEEN WANTING TO
FOR A WHILE, AND THEN...

03:47.009 --> 03:49.054
REALLY? YOU NEVER SAID
ANYTHING ABOUT DOING THAT.

03:49.054 --> 03:52.101
YEAH. AND THEN THIS GUY
I KNOW INTRODUCES ME
TO CHUCK PULLMAN.

03:54.103 --> 03:57.149
CHUCK PULLMAN,
HE PRETTY MUCH OWNS
THE WRESTLING FEDERATION.

03:57.149 --> 03:59.674
YEAH, ANYWAY, CHUCK OFFERED
ME AN INTERNSHIP, AND I'M--

03:59.674 --> 04:04.113
WAIT A SECOND,
YOU LEFT COLLEGE TO
INTERN FOR WRESTLING?

04:04.113 --> 04:06.071
THERE IT IS.

04:06.071 --> 04:07.290
THAT EXACT EXPRESSION

04:07.290 --> 04:08.726
MY PARENTS HAD
WHEN I TOLD THEM.

04:08.726 --> 04:10.685
WAIT. NO.
I DIDN'T MEAN...

04:10.685 --> 04:12.426
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW
IS ALL.

04:12.426 --> 04:13.601
YOU KNOW?

04:13.601 --> 04:16.386
LOOK,
THE TRUTH IS I ALSO...

04:16.386 --> 04:19.433
I WASN'T SURE
THAT YOU'D WANT
TO HEAR FROM ME.

04:19.433 --> 04:21.957
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
WILL, YOU'RE MY...

04:23.263 --> 04:25.003
I--I MEAN, WE GO
BACK, YOU KNOW?

04:25.003 --> 04:26.527
WE GO BACK
A LONG WAY.

04:27.963 --> 04:30.139
YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:30.139 --> 04:31.140
YOU WANNA GO GRAB
A CUP OF COFFEE?

04:31.140 --> 04:32.663
CATCH UP?

04:32.663 --> 04:36.014
UM, ACTUALLY, I GOTTA DO A
PICKUP AT THE AIRPORT.

04:36.014 --> 04:40.541
OH. OK. YEAH,
UH--RESTAURANT
STUFF.

04:40.541 --> 04:42.978
SO, ARE YOU STAYING
AT YOUR PARENTS'
PLACE?

04:42.978 --> 04:44.545
YEAH. YEAH,
YOU SHOULD, UH...

04:44.545 --> 04:46.111
YEAH. I'LL GIVE
YOU A CALL.

04:47.939 --> 04:49.593
IT'S GOOD TO SEE
YOU, MAN.

05:02.171 --> 05:03.433
WHAT'RE YOU
DOING?

05:03.433 --> 05:04.608
IT'S A HALF HOUR
TO THE AIRPORT.

05:04.608 --> 05:07.089
HOUR ROUND TRIP,
RIGHT?

05:07.089 --> 05:09.265
I GOT AN HOUR.

05:14.444 --> 05:17.578
SEE, THAT PADDLE BIT
MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE.

05:17.578 --> 05:20.320
SO, TRY THAT
AND SEE IF IT WORKS.

05:23.235 --> 05:25.412
IS THIS YOUR
FREE PERIOD,
MR. SALINGER?

05:25.412 --> 05:28.328
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE,
MRS. SALINGER?

05:29.503 --> 05:30.678
WELL,
I'VE GOT NEWS.

05:30.678 --> 05:32.462
OK, MAYBE NOT NEWS,
BUT INFORMATION.

05:32.462 --> 05:34.638
ALL RIGHT.
BEAR CLAWS.

05:34.638 --> 05:36.248
SEE, I'VE BEEN
LOOKING INTO WHAT WE
WERE TALKING ABOUT.

05:36.248 --> 05:37.554
YOU KNOW,
ABOUT STARTING--

05:37.554 --> 05:39.077
I MEAN EXPANDING
OUR FAMILY.

05:39.077 --> 05:40.470
ME, TOO.

05:45.257 --> 05:47.216
"ADOPTION AND YOU.

05:47.216 --> 05:49.740
ADOPTION,
THE BEST CHOICE."

05:49.740 --> 05:51.307
THIS IS GREAT,
CHARLIE.

05:51.307 --> 05:55.398
REALLY...I AM
SO GLAD THAT YOU
ARE SO BEHIND THIS.

05:55.398 --> 05:58.445
YEAH.
I'M EXCITED.

05:58.445 --> 06:00.098
AND ADOPTION
IS GREAT.

06:00.098 --> 06:04.320
BUT IT'S NOT
LIKE HAVING
OUR OWN, RIGHT?

06:04.320 --> 06:06.844
WELL, NO, BUT SINCE
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN--

06:06.844 --> 06:08.542
BUT WHAT IF
IT COULD?

06:08.542 --> 06:11.022
FERTILITY MEDICINE
HAS COME AMAZINGLY
FAR

06:11.022 --> 06:12.763
SINCE THEY FIRST
SAID I COULDN'T
HAVE CHILDREN,

06:12.763 --> 06:14.591
EVEN WHEN I LOOKED
INTO IT LATER.

06:14.591 --> 06:15.984
YOU MEAN,
WITH PAUL?

06:15.984 --> 06:17.289
LIKE WITH
LAPAROSCOPIC
PROCEDURES?

06:17.289 --> 06:19.640
TO FIX THE DAMAGE
FROM MY ENDOMETRIOSIS?

06:19.640 --> 06:22.077
THOSE OPERATIONS
ARE MUCH MORE
SUCCESSFUL NOW.

06:22.077 --> 06:24.035
REALLY, I--
THE PROBLEM
WITH THAT IS

06:24.035 --> 06:26.777
THE RISKS OF ECTOPIC
PREGNANCY GO FAIRLY
HIGH.

06:26.777 --> 06:29.345
BUT, LUCKY FOR US,
THERE'S IVF.

06:29.345 --> 06:31.913
YOU KNOW,
WHERE THEY TAKE
THE EGG OUT

06:31.913 --> 06:33.175
AND THEY MIX IT
WITH THE SPERM

06:33.175 --> 06:34.437
AND THEN THEY PUT
THE EGG BACK IN.

06:34.437 --> 06:37.353
AND MY ODDS FOR THAT
GET MUCH BETTER.

06:37.353 --> 06:38.789
THEY DO?
WELL, YEAH!

06:38.789 --> 06:40.225
THEY USED TO BE
PRACTICALLY NIL,

06:40.225 --> 06:42.184
BUT NOW THERE'S
A 1-IN-10 SHOT
AT LEAST,

06:42.184 --> 06:44.534
WHICH BASICALLY
MEANS THAT INVITRO
IS THE WAY TO GO.

06:44.534 --> 06:46.144
DON'T YOU THINK?

06:46.144 --> 06:50.801
THINK? I THINK, UH...
I MEAN IT'S JUST
A LOT...

06:50.801 --> 06:53.978
'CAUSE--'CAUSE IF WE
COULD ACTUALLY HAVE
OUR OWN...

06:53.978 --> 06:57.286
CHARLIE...WE'D HAVE
TO TRY, RIGHT?

07:00.115 --> 07:02.030
YEAH. I GUESS SO.

07:03.771 --> 07:06.861
I AM SO--I AM
SO GLAD THAT YOU
FEEL THE SAME WAY,

07:06.861 --> 07:10.821
BECAUSE--'CAUSE,
I--UM, I CALLED
A SPECIALIST,

07:10.821 --> 07:14.521
AND HE HAD
A CANCELLATION.
UM--AT 3:00 TODAY.

07:14.521 --> 07:17.175
SO DO YOU THINK
THAT YOU--YOU COULD
MAKE IT?

07:17.175 --> 07:18.176
TODAY?

07:18.176 --> 07:19.830
MM-HMM.

07:19.830 --> 07:23.051
WELL, UH...SURE.

07:23.051 --> 07:24.879
YEAH.

07:25.793 --> 07:26.968
OK, GOOD.

07:28.012 --> 07:29.405
"ANOTHER FRIDAY NIGHT BASH,

07:29.405 --> 07:31.320
"HOSTED BY GRANT'S
PROM QUEEN.

07:31.320 --> 07:34.236
ONLY THE ELITE,
CHIC, AND SLENDER
WERE ALLOWED ENTRANCE."

07:34.236 --> 07:36.891
OH, WHAT? I WAS
SUPPOSED TO INVITE
THE ENTIRE SCHOOL?

07:36.891 --> 07:39.937
"AND SPEAKING OF CHIC,
IF THE GIRL SPENT
HALF AS MUCH TIME

07:39.937 --> 07:42.113
"IN THE LIBRARY
AS SHE DOES
IN THE MALL,

07:42.113 --> 07:44.072
"MAYBE SHE'D MAKE
MORE OF HERSELF

07:44.072 --> 07:47.075
THAN THE COUNTRY
CLUB GREETER
SHE'S DESTINED TO BE."

07:47.075 --> 07:49.381
WHAT?
OH, THAT IS SO UNFAIR.

07:49.381 --> 07:50.774
I STUDY ALL THE TIME.

07:50.774 --> 07:52.863
"BUT TO QUOTE
THE PROM QUEEN HERSELF,

07:52.863 --> 07:56.824
A GOOD LIFE
IS A GOOD-LOOKING LIFE."

07:56.824 --> 07:58.826
WOW.

07:58.826 --> 08:03.700
I MEAN, I SAID THAT,
BUT TO BE FUNNY.

08:03.700 --> 08:05.223
SOME PEOPLE JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S A JOKE

08:05.223 --> 08:07.312
AND WHAT'S NOT.

08:07.312 --> 08:10.881
WELL, HE'S SAYING
I'M COMPLETELY
SUPERFICIAL.

08:10.881 --> 08:13.014
WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
SKIP THE MALL
THIS WEEKEND.

08:13.014 --> 08:14.319
JUST TO PROVE
HIM WRONG.

08:14.319 --> 08:15.886
OH, SO NOW I HAVE
TO STOP BEING ME

08:15.886 --> 08:17.801
JUST TO MAKE
HIM HAPPY?

08:17.801 --> 08:19.063
THIS IS SO...

08:20.848 --> 08:25.113
I DON'T THINK
ANYTHING WOULD MAKE
THIS GUY HAPPY.

08:46.700 --> 08:48.136
UH, HI.

08:49.267 --> 08:53.010
UM, WHO--WHO ARE YOU?

08:53.010 --> 08:56.100
WHAT, ARE YOU
THE NEW NANNY?

08:56.100 --> 09:00.931
I'M GRIFFIN.
I, UH, RENT THE SHED
FOR MY BUSINESS.

09:00.931 --> 09:02.411
GOOD LUCK.

09:05.066 --> 09:07.590
VICTOR! CLAUDIA
CALLED FOR HER
MESSAGES.

09:07.590 --> 09:09.200
GOOD.
SO I ASKED HER,

09:09.200 --> 09:10.680
AND SHE SAID YES.

09:10.680 --> 09:13.074
AND JULIA ALREADY
SAID SHE DIDN'T
CARE,

09:13.074 --> 09:15.511
SO THAT MEANS
WE CAN HAVE
THE HAUNTED HOUSE.

09:15.511 --> 09:17.644
AND BAILEY SAID
WHAT, DO I RECALL?

09:17.644 --> 09:21.778
NO...BUT, SEE,
WE'RE ALL BROTHERS
AND SISTERS,

09:21.778 --> 09:23.998
SO WE HAVE MAJORITY
RULES.

09:23.998 --> 09:26.696
THAT'S HOW WE DECIDE
IMPORTANT STUFF.

09:26.696 --> 09:29.307
AND IT'S 3 AGAINST
ONE, I SWEAR.

09:30.961 --> 09:32.441
WELL...

09:32.441 --> 09:34.399
NO ONE LOVES
A HAUNTED HOUSE
MORE THAN I DO.

09:34.399 --> 09:36.271
BUT WE DO THIS,
WE HAVE
TO BE WILLING

09:36.271 --> 09:37.446
TO LIVE
WITH THE CONSEQUENCES.

09:37.446 --> 09:38.795
THE WHAT?

09:38.795 --> 09:39.883
CONSEQUENCES.

09:39.883 --> 09:41.319
YOU THROW A COCONUT UP,

09:41.319 --> 09:42.582
IT COMES DOWN
ON YOUR HEAD.

09:42.582 --> 09:43.931
CONSEQUENCES.

09:43.931 --> 09:45.367
YOU THROW A PARTY,

09:45.367 --> 09:46.324
IT COMES DOWN
ON YOUR HEAD.

09:46.324 --> 09:47.674
CONSEQUENCES.

09:47.674 --> 09:50.154
THERE WON'T BE
CONSEQUENCES. I SWEAR.

09:51.286 --> 09:53.331
OK. LET'S DO IT.

09:53.331 --> 09:55.333
YES! ALL RIGHT!

09:56.639 --> 09:59.642
OH!
EXCUSE ME!

09:59.642 --> 10:01.209
AH, THERE YOU ARE!

10:01.209 --> 10:03.341
GOD,
I WISH YOU'D STOP
MISSING CLASS, JULIA!

10:03.341 --> 10:05.517
I'M SPENDING
WAY TOO MUCH TIME
DENYING RUMORS ABOUT YOU.

10:05.517 --> 10:07.389
EVAN WOULDN'T LET
ME OUT. HE KEPT
SLICING AND DICING.

10:07.389 --> 10:10.653
WAIT A SECOND.
RUMORS.
W-W-WHAT RUMORS?

10:10.653 --> 10:13.482
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
JULIA GOT THIS
BOOK DEAL ON HER BACK,

10:13.482 --> 10:14.875
AND HER BOOK
AIN'T THE ONLY THING

10:14.875 --> 10:16.616
EVAN STILMAN WANTS
BETWEEN COVERS.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.443
WHAT? YOU'RE
KIDDING ME.

10:18.443 --> 10:21.490
THAT IS SO--HAH!
YOU'RE KIDDING
ME.

10:21.490 --> 10:23.013
WHY WOULD THEY
SAY THAT?

10:23.013 --> 10:24.580
YOU'RE NOT TOO BRIGHT,
ARE YOU?

10:24.580 --> 10:27.191
IZ, THE GUY IS TWICE
MY AGE, AND I WORK
FOR THE MAN.

10:27.191 --> 10:29.063
YEAH, THE RUMOR MILL
KNOWS THAT, HONEY,
BUT THEY DON'T CARE.

10:29.063 --> 10:30.717
WHY NOT?

10:30.717 --> 10:33.720
WELL, 'CAUSE YOU TWO,
YOU'RE SUCH A CLICHE.

10:33.720 --> 10:34.721
YOU'RE SO OBVIOUS.

10:34.721 --> 10:36.157
OBVIOUS.

10:36.157 --> 10:37.506
EVAN AND ME. HOW?

10:37.506 --> 10:39.334
BRIEFLY?

10:39.334 --> 10:41.423
YOU'VE BOTH GOT LOOKS.
YOU'VE BOTH GOT BRAINS.

10:41.423 --> 10:45.209
YOU'VE GOT MATCHING
JONESES FOR BOOKS.
DID I MENTION LOOKS?

10:45.209 --> 10:47.559
IZ, IT IS SO
NOT HAPPENING.

10:47.559 --> 10:50.040
EVAN HAS,
LIKE, LESS THAN
NO INTEREST IN ME.

10:50.040 --> 10:54.218
AND I HAVE--
I--I BASICALLY
FEEL THE SAME.

10:54.218 --> 10:57.352
OK. FINE. THAT'S FINE.
I WAS JUST PASSING
ON THE INFORMATION.

10:57.352 --> 10:58.745
HE DRIVES ME NUTS,
TO TELL YOU
THE TRUTH.

10:58.745 --> 11:00.268
I MEAN
HE JUST WORKS
AND WORKS AND WORKS,

11:00.268 --> 11:02.183
AND I SIT THERE
AND I'M COMPLETELY
INVISIBLE.

11:02.183 --> 11:04.228
UH-HUH.
I MEAN IF HE
WOULD STOP

11:04.228 --> 11:05.752
RIPPING ON MY WORK
FOR 15 SECONDS,

11:05.752 --> 11:07.754
OR SO MUCH AS SMILE
AT ME, THEN...

11:10.626 --> 11:12.628
THAT DOES NOT
PROVE I'M
INTERESTED IN HIM.

11:13.585 --> 11:15.587
I SAID NOTHING.

11:15.587 --> 11:17.589
DID I SAY SOMETHING?

11:24.205 --> 11:26.207
I MEAN AT FIRST,
I WAS JUST
RUNNING ERRANDS.

11:26.207 --> 11:27.687
YOU KNOW,
FETCHING COFFEE
AND STUFF.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.471
THEN THEY PUT ME
IN CHARGE OF

11:29.471 --> 11:31.560
STOCKING
THE DRESSING ROOMS.

11:31.560 --> 11:33.693
INCLUDING
THE RING GIRLS.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.825
WOW.
THE RING GIRLS.

11:35.825 --> 11:37.392
YOU KNOW THE GIRLS
THAT WALK AROUND
THE RING

11:37.392 --> 11:38.610
HOLDING UP
THE SCORE CARDS,

11:38.610 --> 11:40.438
WEARING THOSE LITTLE
THONGY THINGS?

11:40.438 --> 11:42.440
OH,
THOSE RING GIRLS.

11:42.440 --> 11:43.746
YOU KNOW,
I'M GOING TO CALL
HOME ONE MORE TIME

11:43.746 --> 11:44.965
TO SEE IF SARAH
LEFT A MESSAGE YET.

11:44.965 --> 11:46.444
THERE HE IS.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.188
THIS IS MY FRIEND
BAILEY.

11:51.188 --> 11:54.801
BAILEY, THIS IS
MR. MAYHEM.

11:54.801 --> 11:56.237
HOW ARE YOU?

11:57.281 --> 11:58.456
WALNUT CREEK.

12:05.812 --> 12:09.076
DID HE JUST SAY,
WALNUT CREEK?

12:12.906 --> 12:14.690
HI. EXCUSE ME,
MR. MAYHEM.

12:14.690 --> 12:17.258
UM, BUT DID YOU SAY...WALNUT CREEK.

12:17.258 --> 12:19.608
849 CREEKSIDE DRIVE.

12:19.608 --> 12:22.654
TAKE THE 68
TO THE IGNACIO EXIT.

12:22.654 --> 12:25.309
BUT, SEE, I'M SUPPOSED
TO TAKE YOU TO THE CITY,

12:25.309 --> 12:29.096
WHERE YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO MEET WITH PUBLICITY
AND SIGN SOME PICTURES.

12:29.096 --> 12:31.968
I HAVEN'T SEEN
MY WIFE IN A WEEK.
NOW MOVE IT!

12:36.016 --> 12:39.715
WILL. WILL! I CAN'T
GO TO WALNUT CREEK!

12:39.715 --> 12:41.021
WELL, WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO?

12:41.021 --> 12:42.370
TELL HIM!I TOLD HIM!

12:42.370 --> 12:43.501
TELL HIM AGAIN!

12:43.501 --> 12:45.068
YOU TELL HIM.
I HAVE TO DRIVE.

12:52.772 --> 12:57.254
YOU KNOW, IT SOUNDS
LIKE YOU'VE GOT SOME
PEOPLE WAITING FOR YOU.

12:57.254 --> 13:00.214
AND THE TRUTH
IS I KINDA HAVE
TO GET BACK TO TOWN, TOO.

13:01.432 --> 13:04.479
SO, HEY. I GOT AN IDEA.

13:04.479 --> 13:09.049
WHY DON'T YOU CALL
YOUR WIFE, HAVE HER
MEET US IN THE CITY.

13:09.049 --> 13:11.529
THAT WAY
EVERYBODY'S HAPPY.

13:11.529 --> 13:14.010
I WANT
TO SURPRISE HER.

13:14.010 --> 13:16.752
YOU GOT A PROBLEM
WITH THAT...BAILEY?

13:19.886 --> 13:21.235
NOPE.

13:21.235 --> 13:23.150
NO PROBLEM.

13:49.611 --> 13:51.091
LOOK AT HIM.
WHAT IS HE DOING?

13:51.091 --> 13:52.962
HE'S JUST SEEING
IF SHE'S HOME.

13:52.962 --> 13:54.268
THERE'S SOMETHING
CALLED A DOORBELL.

13:54.268 --> 13:55.791
WELL...

13:55.791 --> 13:57.749
WHAT ARE WE SNEAKING AROUND THE
BACK LIKE THIS FOR?

13:57.749 --> 14:00.927
WELL, SEE THINGS
ARE A LITTLE DICEY
WITH HIM AND HIS WIFE.

14:00.927 --> 14:03.059
SINCE THE WHOLE
MONSTRA THING.

14:03.059 --> 14:04.539
MONSTRA?

14:04.539 --> 14:06.193
YEAH, MONSTRA
IS A FEMALE WRESTLER

14:06.193 --> 14:07.977
WHO'S PUTTING
THE MOVES
ON MR. MAYHEM.

14:07.977 --> 14:10.110
NOW, ISIS CAUGHT THEM
ON MONDAY NIGHT MASSACRE,

14:10.110 --> 14:12.242
AND...
ISIS?

14:12.242 --> 14:13.853
ISIS IS MRS. MAYHEM.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.768
SHE THINKS MR. MAYHEM
HAS A THING FOR MONSTRA.

14:16.768 --> 14:18.988
AND IS ANY OF THIS
ACTUALLY REAL?

14:18.988 --> 14:21.991
HEY, MR. MAYHEM MET
HIS WIFE IN THE RING.

14:21.991 --> 14:24.037
I MEAN WHAT IS REALER
THAN THAT, HUH?

14:24.037 --> 14:25.125
I MEAN, LOOK AT HIM.

14:25.125 --> 14:26.517
HE MISSES HER.

14:26.517 --> 14:27.954

FOR A SECOND?
I AM CURRENTLY
STRANDED WITH YOU.

14:32.654 --> 14:35.178
NO CELL PHONE,
NO PAY PHONE
TO CALL A CAB,

14:35.178 --> 14:37.093
WHILE SOMEONE NAMED
MAYHEM

14:37.093 --> 14:40.227
WORKS OUT HIS
ISSUES WITH ISIS
AND MONSTRA.

14:40.227 --> 14:42.707
LOOK, COULDN'T YOU MAYBE
JUST ROLL WITH THIS THING,
BAILEY?

14:42.707 --> 14:44.274
I HAVE ROLLED
WITH IT, WILL,

14:44.274 --> 14:46.842
ALL THE WAY PAST
A STAFF MEETING,
INVENTORY,

14:46.842 --> 14:49.497
AND PAST ANY POSSIBLE
CHANCE TO CONNECT
WITH SARAH.

14:49.497 --> 14:52.282
YOU KNOW,
IF YOU--IF YOU WOULD
JUST CUT YOURSELF LOOSE

14:52.282 --> 14:54.502
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE,
HUH? MAYBE TAKE
A VACATION

14:54.502 --> 14:56.286
FROM THIS MIDDLE-AGED

THRILL RIDE, OK?

15:05.774 --> 15:07.123
OK. YOU,
BAILEY.

15:07.123 --> 15:08.908
I'M GONNA HOIST YOU
UP TO THAT BALCONY.

15:10.083 --> 15:11.084
WHAT?

15:11.084 --> 15:12.520
SHE TURNED OFF
THE PHONE,

15:12.520 --> 15:15.958
CHANGED ALL THE LOCKS,
IT'S THE ONLY WAY IN.

15:15.958 --> 15:18.091
I'M NOT GOIN'
UP THERE. NO WAY.

15:19.701 --> 15:21.921
FORGET IT!
I WON'T.

15:24.445 --> 15:25.925

15:25.925 --> 15:29.102
YEAH.
I'M JUST GREAT.

15:29.102 --> 15:30.712

THE SAME THING, TOO,

15:33.367 --> 15:35.195
[EVAN AND GIRL LAUGH]

15:35.195 --> 15:38.850
OH, HEY,
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE
CONTEMPLATING ESCAPE.

15:38.850 --> 15:41.984
WHAT? UH, NO.
I WAS--NO.

15:41.984 --> 15:45.248
WELL, SO YOU JUST
MISSED MY JOKE.

15:45.248 --> 15:47.381
YES, YES.
I TOLD A JOKE.

15:47.381 --> 15:48.643
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

15:48.643 --> 15:49.949
HMM?

15:52.125 --> 15:55.998
UH, LISTEN. BEFORE
WE START, I WAS, UH,

15:55.998 --> 15:58.174
I WAS THINKING ABOUT
WHAT YOU SAID.

15:58.174 --> 16:00.350
AND YOU MIGHT
HAVE BEEN RIGHT.

16:00.350 --> 16:02.918
SO I THOUGHT, UM...

16:02.918 --> 16:05.138
WELL,
TELL ME, ARE YOU
BUSY TONIGHT?

16:05.138 --> 16:07.879
I'M SORRY.
BUSY TONIGHT?

16:07.879 --> 16:09.316
'CAUSE IT'S TRUE.

16:09.316 --> 16:10.926
WE'VE BEEN ALL ABOUT
WORK AROUND HERE.

16:10.926 --> 16:13.059
AND MAYBE THAT'S
WRONG.

16:13.059 --> 16:15.017
WRONG?

16:15.017 --> 16:18.325
I'VE GOT THESE TICKETS
FOR THIS HALLOWEEN
FUNDRAISER BALL TONIGHT,

16:18.325 --> 16:21.154
AND IT'S A COSTUME
THING, AND I KNOW
IT'S THE LAST MINUTE...

16:21.154 --> 16:24.548
WE HAVE THIS
WHOLE CHAPTER
TO DO, DON'T WE?

16:24.548 --> 16:27.508
YEAH, SURE, BUT THIS
IS A CHANCE TO KICK
BACK A LITTLE BIT.

16:27.508 --> 16:30.511
YOU KNOW, AND DRINK
CHAMPAGNE, MAYBE DANCE,
EAT SOME OYSTERS...

16:30.511 --> 16:33.862
YOU KNOW WHAT,
THAT SOUNDS REALLY
NICE. IT DOES.

16:33.862 --> 16:36.691
BUT I--I DON'T KNOW.
ARE YOU SURE?

16:36.691 --> 16:38.258
OH, YEAH. YEAH.
BECAUSE OTHERWISE

16:38.258 --> 16:39.999
THESE BABIES
ARE GOING
TO GO TO WASTE.

16:39.999 --> 16:43.654
MY DATE, SHE WANTS
TO HAVE A QUIET DINNER
INSTEAD. SO...

16:43.654 --> 16:45.047

16:45.047 --> 16:47.136
OH, YOU, UH,

16:50.270 --> 16:52.837
AND HAS NO USE
FOR THESE EVENTS.
BUT YOU DO.

16:52.837 --> 16:57.146
SO I THOUGHT,
STARVING WRITER,
FREE FOOD...

16:57.146 --> 17:00.193
COME ON. YOU CAN
TAKE A DATE. HMM?

17:00.193 --> 17:02.412

GO AS HOUDINI,

17:20.039 --> 17:21.910
LOOK, I KNOW
THE WEBSITE BUGS YOU.

17:21.910 --> 17:24.304
FORGET ABOUT ME.
SHE'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND, CAMERON.

17:24.304 --> 17:28.221
I MEAN, IF YOU HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH HOW MUCH
SHE SHOPS OR WHATEVER,

17:28.221 --> 17:29.222
TELL HER.

17:29.222 --> 17:31.354
I TRIED, OK?
BUT FORGET IT.

17:31.354 --> 17:33.661
SHE HAS SOME
OBSESSION WITH
HOW SHE LOOKS.

17:33.661 --> 17:35.054
SHE'S A GIRL,
CAMERON.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.490
WAKE UP.

17:36.490 --> 17:38.100

NOT LIKE THAT.

I'M NOT
YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

17:39.754 --> 17:42.278
ALEXA IS.
I THINK SHE DESERVES BETTER

17:42.278 --> 17:45.151
THAN GETTING
ANONYMOUS LIFE ADVICE
OVER THE INTERNET.

17:45.151 --> 17:47.066
I'M TRYING TO DO
SOMETHING FOR HER.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.677
SO DO IT IN PERSON.
YOU'RE SUCH--OHH!

THIS ORIGINAL PERSON,

17:52.027 --> 17:54.073

17:54.073 --> 17:57.032
I MEAN, IF YOU COULD
JUST BE YOURSELF WITH HER...

17:57.032 --> 17:59.469
NOW, THAT'S HOW YOU
DO SOMETHING FOR HER.

18:00.905 --> 18:03.734
IT WOULDN'T HURT YOU
ANY EITHER.

ALL RIGHT, WHERE
DO YOU WANT IT?

GET BAILEY ONBOARD

19:00.051 --> 19:03.403
YEAH, BUT, SEE,
OWEN SAID IT WAS OK.

19:17.895 --> 19:18.940
NO.

19:20.681 --> 19:21.769

RESCHEDULE.

19:21.769 --> 19:23.074

GOING FOR IT AGAIN.

19:37.480 --> 19:39.700

EASY TALKING WAYNE INTO IT.
