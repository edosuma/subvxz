00:19.152 --> 00:20.983
It's alive!

00:39.506 --> 00:40.871
Yep.

00:44.277 --> 00:45.904
Oh, will it hurt?

00:45.945 --> 00:47.537
Only if God hates you.

00:47.580 --> 00:48.774
Hey, mamma mia!

00:48.815 --> 00:50.680
The cannoli! Eh, lasagna!

00:50.717 --> 00:53.049
Hey, pasta fagioli!
A spicy meatball!

00:59.893 --> 01:02.987
Dude, it's time
to pimp your sister.

01:03.029 --> 01:04.690
Oh, yeah! Man, I can't believe...

01:04.730 --> 01:06.028
Yo, man,
my sister right in there.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.533
Come pimp that bitch out!

01:07.567 --> 01:10.832
<i>Pimp my Sister</i>

01:10.870 --> 01:12.895
Wait! W-wait!
Wait! I have homework.

01:15.341 --> 01:17.002
Hey, ladies!

01:17.043 --> 01:18.670
We gonna pimp you out!

01:18.711 --> 01:21.509
Girl, you got serious
librarian hair.

01:22.582 --> 01:24.709
You ever see a ho
shop at The Gap?

01:24.751 --> 01:27.345
You got the posture
of a lamp post, girl.

01:27.387 --> 01:29.116
We got to give you
some prosti-tude.

01:29.155 --> 01:31.646
If we go with a leopard
print tank top...

01:31.691 --> 01:34.182
that's a little too
southeast Newark.

01:34.227 --> 01:36.661
So we're going with more
of a cheetah pattern.

01:36.696 --> 01:39.722
Garter belts ain't just
for weddings, honey child.

01:39.766 --> 01:41.358
You can tuck a weapon in there.

01:41.401 --> 01:43.699
At first,
I was pretty nervous...

01:43.736 --> 01:46.330
but these hos
are all about class.

01:47.540 --> 01:49.804
Sometimes a john
will want to do that with you...

01:49.843 --> 01:52.038
and that'll cost $10.

01:52.078 --> 01:54.876
This one... $50.

01:54.914 --> 01:57.439
And this one
gonna require a credit card.

01:59.152 --> 02:00.744
- Again!
- Don't play me!

02:00.787 --> 02:02.584
- Again!
- Don't play me!

02:02.622 --> 02:05.352
All right, Alex. Now, we ain't
had a lot to work with here...

02:05.391 --> 02:07.325
but, yo,
check out your new sister!

02:07.360 --> 02:08.827
Let me see.

02:08.862 --> 02:10.658
Oh, damn!

02:10.697 --> 02:12.665
Oh, you put the heels...
Oh, you got this garter...

02:12.699 --> 02:13.825
Damn!

02:13.867 --> 02:16.927
Oh! Check out the fish nets!
Oh, damn!

02:16.970 --> 02:18.198
It's the new me...

02:18.238 --> 02:22.072
not just on the outside,
but on the inside, too.

02:22.108 --> 02:23.700
Go and make some money.

02:23.743 --> 02:25.108
You just got to spread your...

02:25.145 --> 02:27.545
It's so hard when they leave.
It's so hard.

02:27.580 --> 02:29.309
Hey, y'all! Hey, yo, man!

02:29.349 --> 02:31.078
Yo, come get a piece
of my sister!

02:31.117 --> 02:32.584
Who wants to get up
in my sister's ass?

02:32.619 --> 02:34.917
Oh, hello, Mr. Johnson.

02:34.954 --> 02:37.946
Hello, Amy.
Do you take credit cards?

02:43.630 --> 02:45.825
We'll be dead soon.

02:48.635 --> 02:50.865
Ow. I'm telling my dad.

02:52.472 --> 02:54.633
Welcome to <i>The Surreal Life.</i>

02:56.943 --> 02:58.774
Come on, come on.

02:58.811 --> 03:00.676
Get down.

03:00.713 --> 03:03.307
Let's take a look
at what <i>The Surreal Life</i> gang...

03:03.349 --> 03:05.078
has been up to recently.

03:05.118 --> 03:07.018
We were really excited
to participate...

03:07.053 --> 03:09.044
in the Iditarod dogsled race...

03:09.088 --> 03:11.613
till one of the dogs
fell in love with Manny Mo.

03:11.658 --> 03:13.558
Help! The dog...

03:14.794 --> 03:18.696
Let's see what's in store for
our <i>Surreal Life</i> folks today.

03:18.731 --> 03:20.562
We have to take
the one ring...

03:20.600 --> 03:23.228
and destroy it
in the fires of Mount Doom.

03:29.475 --> 03:31.705
Wait, something's coming!

03:47.727 --> 03:49.627
There's no way I'm doing this.

03:49.662 --> 03:52.324
Somebody better get me a cab
'cause I'm going...

04:14.087 --> 04:15.850
We must helps them.

04:15.888 --> 04:17.719
They's our friend.

04:17.757 --> 04:20.055
They hates Manny Mo.

04:20.093 --> 04:23.153
No, they loves us.

04:24.130 --> 04:27.588
If they dies, we go get pizza.

04:31.304 --> 04:33.704
Yep, yep, come and get it,
oh, yeah

04:45.385 --> 04:49.788
Back to the fires
that forged you, evil trinket!

04:57.664 --> 05:00.292
Corey, you saved me, bro.

05:00.333 --> 05:02.301
You can burn in hell.
I just want the ring.

05:02.335 --> 05:03.893
Corey, no!

05:05.071 --> 05:06.129
Oh, bro!

05:06.172 --> 05:09.733
Oh, friends,
remember me fondly...

05:09.776 --> 05:13.439
in <i>Stand By Me</i>
and in <i>The Lost Boys...</i>

05:13.479 --> 05:14.912
only the first half.

05:14.947 --> 05:17.745
Wait, and <i>Friday the 13th</i>
was pretty good...

05:17.784 --> 05:20.446
Next time on <i>The Surreal Life...</i>

05:20.486 --> 05:24.183
Well, Ron and I had to check out
a suspicious meteor.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.497
Boo!

05:41.974 --> 05:45.466
You didn't think
it'd be that easy, did you?

05:46.946 --> 05:49.642
Chocolate chicken eggs
for everyone!

05:49.682 --> 05:51.274
One, two, three, four!

05:51.317 --> 05:53.217
We love it when
our players score!

05:53.252 --> 05:54.947
Five, six, seven, eight!

05:54.987 --> 05:56.955
Double entendres
are really great!

05:56.989 --> 05:59.924
I want to go to Dallas,
but I don't have any money.

05:59.959 --> 06:01.221
We're such good friends...

06:01.260 --> 06:04.252
we'll have sex with people
for money and give it to you.

06:04.297 --> 06:05.321
Yeah!

06:05.365 --> 06:07.833
Oh, best friends forever!

06:07.867 --> 06:12.065
We're soaking wet from washing
your car, Mr. Thrustbone.

06:12.105 --> 06:15.074
Is there anything else
we can do for you?

06:15.108 --> 06:18.373
I'll give you $20
for all of us to go crazy.

06:18.411 --> 06:19.469
Wow!

06:19.512 --> 06:22.413
$20 in 1978 dollars is a lot.

06:22.448 --> 06:24.416
Yeah!

06:24.450 --> 06:26.884
Yeah! Oh, you look just like
my daughter's friends.

06:26.919 --> 06:27.908
Oh, yeah.

06:29.322 --> 06:31.347
Watch out for the icing.

06:31.391 --> 06:32.483
Dang it.

06:32.525 --> 06:34.322
We raised $39!

06:34.360 --> 06:37.124
That's exactly enough
to get to Dallas.

06:37.163 --> 06:41.600
Yay! I'm finally in Dallas.

06:42.969 --> 06:45.961
Oh, I wonder how much
it is to get back.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.445
I'm stepping
down the ladder and...

06:59.485 --> 07:00.952
Uh-oh!

07:00.987 --> 07:02.716
Uh-oh, I'm falling.

07:02.755 --> 07:04.052
Yeah.

07:04.090 --> 07:05.717
Yeah, I'm falling on the moon.

07:05.758 --> 07:07.783
Yes, I'm...

07:07.827 --> 07:09.454
falling on the moon.

07:16.602 --> 07:21.062
OK, uh,
hailing frequencies are open.

07:25.344 --> 07:26.902
Hurray!

07:37.457 --> 07:39.618
Is he gonna do it again?

07:39.659 --> 07:40.956
Wrong, your reservations are.

07:40.993 --> 07:42.961
For us to listen
to Ray Griffiths...

07:42.995 --> 07:45.156
the actor who played
the power droid in <i>Episode IV...</i>

07:45.198 --> 07:46.825
this is room is scheduled.

07:46.866 --> 07:49.699
I reserved room A-2 to watch
the <i>Star Trek</i> blooper reel...

07:49.735 --> 07:52.101
where DeForest Kelley
grabs Majel Barrett's chest.

07:52.138 --> 07:53.935
The Prime Directive demands
that you leave the premises.

07:53.973 --> 07:55.702
The Prime Directive sucks.

07:55.741 --> 07:57.766
You suck, you nerf herder!

07:57.810 --> 07:59.471
Ooh, Seven of Nine.

07:59.512 --> 08:01.946
I heard one William Shatner...

08:01.981 --> 08:04.245
is going to do a guest spot
on <i>Enterprise...</i>

08:04.283 --> 08:06.148
and not as Kirk!

08:06.185 --> 08:07.880
You take that back!

08:11.924 --> 08:15.587
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
we could discuss this logically.

08:17.964 --> 08:19.693
Excuse me, I'm Ray Griffiths.

08:19.732 --> 08:20.756
Oh, my face!

08:22.935 --> 08:24.163
You kids stop. No fighting.

08:24.203 --> 08:26.171
Oh! Get off me. Ow.

08:26.205 --> 08:28.605
My neck, my spine.
Oh, no, not like this.

08:31.777 --> 08:34.472
Excuse me,
but are you gentlemen...

08:34.514 --> 08:37.745
engaged in a game of LARP...
live action role-playing?

08:37.783 --> 08:39.250
I happen to be
an old hand at it.

08:41.120 --> 08:43.087
Lightning bolt! Lightning bolt!

08:43.121 --> 08:44.179
Fire! Fire!

08:44.222 --> 08:46.248
Excuse me, that's impolite.

08:48.127 --> 08:50.095
Stop!

08:50.129 --> 08:51.892
Oh, that's it!

08:54.300 --> 08:56.131
All systems ready.

09:05.044 --> 09:08.138
Don't worry, Mr. Schumacher,
we'll get you out of here.

09:08.180 --> 09:11.707
Joel Schumacher
is history's greatest monster.

09:11.751 --> 09:13.719
- Get him!
- Let's get him!

09:15.922 --> 09:17.014
Got him!

09:17.056 --> 09:18.216
I got him!

09:20.560 --> 09:21.549
Keep it coming.

09:21.594 --> 09:22.959
OK, got it. Got it.

09:22.995 --> 09:24.622
Get another one.
Get me another one.

09:32.772 --> 09:35.138
Shame on you.
You've all forgotten...

09:35.174 --> 09:37.074
the true meaning of fandom.

09:37.109 --> 09:42.046
We should take joy in our loves,
not argue about them.

09:43.282 --> 09:45.409
Son of a bitch!
