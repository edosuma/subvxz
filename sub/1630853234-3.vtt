00:03.712 --> 00:08.717
Alex Butler was like a son
to me.

00:08.758 --> 00:11.720
A dear friend.

00:11.761 --> 00:16.099
A vibrant,
brilliant young man.

00:16.141 --> 00:20.020
Alex was so much more than
an assistant.

00:21.354 --> 00:23.606
A valued colleague.

00:25.316 --> 00:28.194
And I loved him enormously.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.783
Our hearts go out
to his family

00:33.825 --> 00:35.702
during this difficult time.

00:35.744 --> 00:37.996
Turn it off.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.040
Toxicology reports came back.

00:40.081 --> 00:42.625
There were a ton of drugs
in his system.

00:42.667 --> 00:45.879
- Oh, I thought he was sober.
- He was sober.

00:45.920 --> 00:47.964
She pushed him too far.

00:48.006 --> 00:50.425
She never gave a shit
that he was sick.

00:50.467 --> 00:52.719
His death is on her.

00:58.892 --> 01:00.977
Finest trick of the devil

01:01.019 --> 01:04.022
is persuading you
he doesn't exist.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.391
You're not eating your lox.

01:40.433 --> 01:41.684
I don't like lox.

01:42.685 --> 01:46.189
Martin.

01:48.274 --> 01:50.110
You're a disgrace, Joyce.

01:55.156 --> 01:58.451
So in terms of the budget
on "Wanderlust"...

01:58.493 --> 01:59.661
All right.

01:59.702 --> 02:00.745
Our stocks went up immediately

02:00.787 --> 02:02.413
after we announced.
- Oh, yeah?

02:02.455 --> 02:03.790
It's a huge property,

02:03.832 --> 02:06.084
and it needs to be
serviced as such.

02:08.837 --> 02:10.922
We can't cheap out on this.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.508
Cheap out.

02:13.550 --> 02:16.219
When have I ever "cheaped out"?

02:16.261 --> 02:20.473
I have a cap and you know it.
And I never go over that cap.

02:20.515 --> 02:22.934
No movie's worth it.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.061
Dolce Vita!
- Yes, sir.

02:27.480 --> 02:29.232
Can you bring me some more
caper berries,

02:29.274 --> 02:30.567
but just two?
- Right away.

02:30.608 --> 02:34.112
In order to win this, we had
to agree to Meredith directing.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.280
First time director.

02:35.321 --> 02:37.532
Female. Huge fucking risk.

02:37.574 --> 02:39.367
And we had to agree
to go high.

02:39.409 --> 02:42.829
And you did because
you thought I would be dead.

02:42.871 --> 02:45.832
And you could spend as much
of my money as you wanted.

02:45.874 --> 02:48.459
But you thought wrong.

02:48.501 --> 02:49.502
Here you are, sir.

02:49.544 --> 02:52.046
You are a prince of a man,
Dolce Vita.

02:52.088 --> 02:54.465
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

02:55.133 --> 03:00.180
- I think his name is Marcello.
- And I call him Dolce Vita.

03:00.221 --> 03:02.891
And you don't get it.

03:02.932 --> 03:04.809
Redmond, we cannot make
this film

03:04.851 --> 03:06.978
as it's currently budgeted.

03:14.652 --> 03:16.446
Then they don't
fucking make it.

03:40.970 --> 03:42.555
I need to get on this plane.

03:42.597 --> 03:44.224
Investors are asking
if he's back.

03:44.265 --> 03:46.142
- Stop.
- CAA's calling.

03:46.184 --> 03:47.227
I'm dealing with it.

03:47.268 --> 03:48.561
So what, is our budget
on "Wanderlust"

03:48.603 --> 03:50.188
basically fucked now?

03:51.189 --> 03:52.774
Information for the car
picking you up

03:52.815 --> 03:53.858
in Phoenix is on there.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.693
I emailed and texted it
to you as well.

03:55.735 --> 03:58.905
I got this for you.
It's a moonstone.

03:58.947 --> 04:02.242
It's supposed to help
with fertility.

04:04.661 --> 04:07.580
- Help Travis till I'm back.
- Of course.

04:07.622 --> 04:10.208
Anything else?
- You could kill Redmond.

04:11.376 --> 04:13.336
Travel safe.

04:19.634 --> 04:21.469
Looks like somebody
got a promotion.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.571
Looks good.

04:40.613 --> 04:43.408
Lining seems perfect.

04:43.449 --> 04:46.869
I think we're good to implant
tomorrow as planned.

04:46.911 --> 04:49.372
Oh, good.

04:49.414 --> 04:51.040
Is Miles not coming?

04:51.082 --> 04:52.500
Uh, no.

04:56.254 --> 04:58.965
So then we'll just
be implanting

04:59.007 --> 05:01.217
the one viable embryo.

05:01.259 --> 05:03.094
The odds--
- I'm aware.

05:03.136 --> 05:06.389
I don't need to tell you
the statistics.

05:08.141 --> 05:11.311
Statistics don't apply to me;
they never have.

07:35.705 --> 07:37.415
Hi.

07:37.457 --> 07:38.666
Change of plans.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.376
Water's too rough for sailing.

07:40.418 --> 07:41.294
Hmm.

07:41.335 --> 07:44.255
You waited till I got here
to tell me that?

07:44.297 --> 07:46.048
I did.

07:46.090 --> 07:48.509
So what are we gonna do
instead?

07:51.471 --> 07:52.972
Possibilities are endless.

07:53.014 --> 07:58.060
♪ Lost in a space
I haven't been before ♪

07:58.102 --> 08:00.062

08:51.155 --> 08:53.199
Out through the mouth.

08:53.241 --> 08:54.450
Good, Joyce.

08:54.492 --> 08:55.660
Just go ahead and do that again

08:55.701 --> 08:58.329
and just kind of relax
the pelvis.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.957
What does your wife do?

09:00.998 --> 09:02.333
Real estate.

09:05.086 --> 09:06.837
She's so beautiful.

10:03.394 --> 10:05.146
All right.

10:05.187 --> 10:06.606
I'm gonna remove the catheter,

10:06.647 --> 10:09.609
so you might feel
a little pressure.

10:09.650 --> 10:11.444
Nice deep breath.

10:37.261 --> 10:38.763
Fuck.

10:52.777 --> 10:55.738
Congratulations
on a successful transfer.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.990
There it is.
- Thank you.

10:58.032 --> 11:01.535
So you need to stay flat
for about 45 more minutes.

11:01.577 --> 11:04.205
Just close your eyes
and try to relax.

11:04.246 --> 11:07.041
If you have any cramping
or bleeding, let me know

11:07.083 --> 11:08.501
as soon as possible.

11:43.869 --> 11:46.330
Nobody named Lou Simms
was every employed here.

11:46.372 --> 11:49.583
A--are you sure?
She listed you as a reference.

11:49.625 --> 11:51.335
Then she lied.

11:52.628 --> 11:56.757
What the fucking fuck?

12:06.100 --> 12:08.602
Look, Alex was your friend.

12:08.644 --> 12:11.772
But the kid
was a recovering addict.

12:11.814 --> 12:13.441
Fell off the wagon

12:13.482 --> 12:14.900
into his pool, drowned.

12:14.942 --> 12:16.652
I mean,
it's pretty cut and dry to me.

12:16.694 --> 12:18.738
Okay, but look,
this new girl--

12:18.779 --> 12:21.490
There is literally no record
of her.

12:21.532 --> 12:23.367
And what 22-year-old
isn't on social media?

12:23.409 --> 12:25.369
Doesn't make her a murderer.

12:25.411 --> 12:26.704
What she said.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.039
I find it kind of refreshing
you asked me.

12:29.081 --> 12:30.666
Town full of YouTube stars

12:30.708 --> 12:33.085
make as much in a month
as I make in a frickin' year.

12:33.127 --> 12:35.004
Try a week.

12:35.045 --> 12:36.672
No offense.

12:36.714 --> 12:37.882
You work in the movie biz.

12:37.923 --> 12:40.342
Spend your days dreaming up
crazy shit.

12:40.384 --> 12:43.763
Sometimes people
just fuckin' drown.

you want, Meredith.

13:29.433 --> 13:33.604
I wrote the book.
I wanna write the screenplay.

13:34.730 --> 13:35.856
Of course.

13:35.898 --> 13:38.442
But as a first-time director,
we want to support you

13:38.484 --> 13:40.110
through the process.

13:40.152 --> 13:43.322
What about Redmond?

13:43.364 --> 13:44.824
Redmond?

13:44.865 --> 13:46.492
Not dead yet.

13:46.534 --> 13:48.494
Is he gonna fuck
with my budget?

13:48.536 --> 13:49.870
Absolutely not.

13:49.912 --> 13:51.831
Hey, let's set a time
for you to come in.

13:51.872 --> 13:53.374
Kick things off.

13:53.415 --> 13:55.835
Well, make sure
my little friend's there.

14:01.924 --> 14:03.968
Copy. Talk soon.

14:09.056 --> 14:11.267
Gonna get into any trouble
this weekend?

14:11.308 --> 14:13.519
No.

14:13.561 --> 14:14.728
You?

14:14.770 --> 14:15.938
Always.

14:18.607 --> 14:22.444
So were you born and raised
in Colorado Springs, or...?

14:23.821 --> 14:26.657
Why the sudden interest
in me?

14:26.699 --> 14:29.910
I don't know anything
about you.

14:29.952 --> 14:33.956
In fact, no one knows anything
about you.

14:35.541 --> 14:38.711
How much can you really know
about anyone?

14:38.752 --> 14:40.129
The cliché
"bitter bitch façade"

14:40.170 --> 14:43.048
you and every other twink
in Boystown project?

14:43.090 --> 14:44.466
I mean...

14:44.508 --> 14:46.719
Is that the real you?

15:25.716 --> 15:29.011
My mom told me
about this place.

15:29.053 --> 15:32.222
She loved old Hollywood movies.

15:32.264 --> 15:34.016
Is she back in Colorado?

15:34.058 --> 15:35.225
She is.

15:37.186 --> 15:39.772
Come on.
Let's find a place to sit.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.485
Gracias.

15:49.698 --> 15:51.659
Where's your little sidekick?

15:51.700 --> 15:54.161
Oh, I'm sorry.
The new--the new intern.

15:54.203 --> 15:55.955
New Alex.

15:55.996 --> 15:58.040
New Marty.

15:58.082 --> 16:01.126
I don't trust that girl
as far as I can throw her.

16:01.168 --> 16:02.419
Right, well,

16:02.461 --> 16:04.713
something tells me
you don't trust anyone, mate.

16:07.174 --> 16:10.344
Why don't you ask Meredith
about her?

16:10.386 --> 16:11.637
At the story meeting.

16:11.679 --> 16:12.721
Meredith?

16:12.763 --> 16:17.518
Bring her a pomegranate açaí
throat lozenge.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.650
Janet Gaynor was such
a goddess.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.235
You know, she's buried here.

16:26.276 --> 16:29.321
Next to her second husband, Adrian.

16:29.363 --> 16:30.614
Didn't know that.

16:31.782 --> 16:33.075
Mm.

16:35.035 --> 16:38.247
Where is Janet Gaynor's
tombstone located

16:38.288 --> 16:40.541
in the Hollywood Forever
Cemetery?

16:49.800 --> 16:51.844
Have you had much
interaction with Meredith

16:51.885 --> 16:52.845
on "Wanderlust"?

16:52.886 --> 16:55.597
A little.

16:55.639 --> 16:56.932
Why?

16:56.974 --> 16:59.226
Just curious.

16:59.268 --> 17:01.895
You seem to be right in there
on everything.

17:01.937 --> 17:05.065
Joyce clearly likes you.
It's no small feat.

17:05.107 --> 17:06.191
Who knows?

17:06.233 --> 17:07.651
She could fire me tomorrow.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.112
Yeah.

17:10.154 --> 17:13.073
Something tells me you'll
probably end up being my boss.

17:13.115 --> 17:15.367
That's not what I want.

17:15.409 --> 17:17.077
So what do you want?

17:18.662 --> 17:19.747
Oh, shit.

17:19.788 --> 17:22.166
Is everyone
from the fucking studio here?

17:25.502 --> 17:27.337
Marty.

17:27.379 --> 17:28.213
Hey.

17:28.255 --> 17:30.299
Hey, how are you? What's up?

17:30.340 --> 17:31.633
How you doing? You good?

17:31.675 --> 17:33.302
- Yeah.
- This is my friend Drea.

17:33.343 --> 17:36.138
Nice to meet you.

17:36.180 --> 17:38.140
Hi.

17:38.182 --> 17:39.349
I'm Lou.

17:39.391 --> 17:41.018
Hi, Lou.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.187
You two haven't met before?

17:44.146 --> 17:45.856
Well, this is, uh,
this is Miles Bresson.

17:45.898 --> 17:48.984
He's Joyce's husband,
and, uh, this is Lou Simms.

17:49.026 --> 17:50.527
She works for Joyce.

17:52.029 --> 17:53.489
Mm.

17:53.530 --> 17:55.032
Nice to meet you, Miles.

17:56.533 --> 17:58.410
Nice to meet you.

18:09.004 --> 18:11.548
You have no brain.

18:11.590 --> 18:14.718
What you think means nothing.

18:14.760 --> 18:18.013
What you feel means nothing.

18:18.055 --> 18:21.058
You are nothing.

18:21.100 --> 18:24.269
Everything you do,
you run through me.

18:24.311 --> 18:28.941
Can't take it?
Roll on back to Bumfuck, Iowa.

18:32.611 --> 18:35.405
Where have you been?
- Blowing Brad Pitt.

18:35.447 --> 18:36.490
Wesley needs a walk.

18:36.532 --> 18:38.242
So fucking walk him.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.217
You're glowing, babe.

18:59.054 --> 19:01.682
I seriously think
you're pregnant.

19:01.723 --> 19:04.476
Stop.

19:04.518 --> 19:06.562
You feel pregnant?

19:06.603 --> 19:09.064
I don't know.

19:16.029 --> 19:18.240
Thanks for coming tonight.

19:18.282 --> 19:20.784
I know the doctor said you
should still be on bed rest.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.870
I wouldn't miss
your big opening.

19:22.911 --> 19:24.663
I think Beaudreax's
gonna show.

19:24.705 --> 19:26.248
The guys from Blackman Cruz
are super stoked.

19:26.290 --> 19:27.583
If I can get these guys
on board,

19:27.624 --> 19:29.209
this could be huge for us.

19:50.397 --> 19:51.690
I'm not cheating.

19:53.525 --> 19:54.735
Stop.

20:03.327 --> 20:05.621
This is my night.
Please don't ruin it.

20:28.101 --> 20:30.354
You know, I--I love
that you say that.

20:30.395 --> 20:31.897
You know,
it all comes from a place

20:31.939 --> 20:32.981
of getting really quiet.

20:33.023 --> 20:35.609
That simplification.

20:35.651 --> 20:37.778
I just really wanted--

20:39.613 --> 20:41.907
To get rid of all the noise.

20:45.494 --> 20:48.247
You work for my fucking wife?

20:48.288 --> 20:49.623
What the fuck are you doing
here?

20:49.665 --> 20:50.791
Joyce invited me.

20:50.832 --> 20:52.542
- Mm.
- What was I supposed to do?

20:52.584 --> 20:54.086
Say no to my boss?
- Did you just text me

20:54.127 --> 20:56.046
a picture of your tits?

20:56.088 --> 20:58.507
Don't flatter yourself.
- You need to leave.

20:58.548 --> 20:59.883
Now.

20:59.925 --> 21:02.344
We hung out for an afternoon.

21:04.179 --> 21:07.057
Don't turn it into something
it isn't, Miles.

21:25.450 --> 21:28.328
Hey. Distilled water.
Thank you.

21:37.254 --> 21:39.089
What are you doing here?

21:40.674 --> 21:42.843
Just wanted to come
and support.

21:45.262 --> 21:47.556
What do you think?

21:47.597 --> 21:49.975
It's pretty.

21:50.017 --> 21:51.977
Translation?

21:55.856 --> 21:57.482
Derivative.

21:59.151 --> 22:02.779
It feels a bit forced.

22:06.950 --> 22:08.660
Did he grow up rich?

22:11.788 --> 22:14.166
Feels like rich kid art.

22:20.672 --> 22:22.466
Get me a napkin.

22:22.507 --> 22:23.842
Napkin.

22:23.884 --> 22:26.219
Stand behind me.
