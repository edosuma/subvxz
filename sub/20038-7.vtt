some headache.

You keep it
as a molehill.

I'd love to do that,
but I have to be honest --

08:27.207 --> 08:29.009
I'm a little worried about
how she's influencing our kids.

No offense, Alice.

Oh, I will cut a bitch!

08:33.747 --> 08:36.083
Alice is definitely
influencing our kids,

08:36.116 --> 08:38.185
but in the best
possible way.

08:38.218 --> 08:39.720
You got to look
at the whole picture.

You mean a picture
like this, Ben?

You didn't
have to hang it.

Or the pictures
on Alice's Instagram,

08:45.693 --> 08:48.629

holding a cocktail. [ Chuckles ]

for her work.

what she does with the kids.

of an expression

her level of enthusiasm.

is a real head-turner.

if I get one, too?

this one at the end of the day.

on your sister?
