00:06.923 --> 00:08.925
[dramatic music playing]

00:26.693 --> 00:30.405
I'm not kidding. The pills. Now!
I told you, I'm on a system now.

00:30.488 --> 00:33.700
I'm not doing drugs. I'm not like you.
I don't fetishize my own sadness.

00:33.783 --> 00:36.119
No, my hands are so slippery.

00:36.911 --> 00:39.789
Damn it, Todd. Clean up your shit.
You know I had sex with Emily.

00:43.960 --> 00:46.171
Turns out there's a brand of heroin
called BoJack.

00:46.254 --> 00:49.007
Please don't make me go back to LA.
You can count on me, Herb.

00:49.090 --> 00:51.342
[Todd] You are all the things
that are wrong with you.

00:51.426 --> 00:52.427
[Diane] You haven't changed.

00:52.510 --> 00:56.723
[BoJack] Yes, you are the last person
to get that. I'm not gonna change.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.480
[groans]

01:03.980 --> 01:05.106
[sighs]

01:11.946 --> 01:12.781
Goddamn...

01:12.864 --> 01:14.866
[theme music playing]

02:08.670 --> 02:09.504
[BoJack sighs]

02:13.508 --> 02:14.342
Sharona?

02:15.927 --> 02:18.972
[Sharona] Ow! You're hurting me.
Let me go! [grunting]

02:19.055 --> 02:20.598
Sarah Lynn got into vodka.

02:20.682 --> 02:24.185
-Oh, my God, is she okay?
-Danny knows she got it from you.

02:24.269 --> 02:25.979
-It was yours.
-Mine, yours.

02:26.062 --> 02:28.439
What difference does it make
who brought this particular vodka?

02:28.523 --> 02:30.817
If I take the fall for this,
this whole show is over.

02:30.900 --> 02:33.862
And that means everything I did
was for nothing.

02:33.945 --> 02:35.613
-What you did?
-To Herb, I mean.

02:35.697 --> 02:37.657
What I did to save the show,
do you understand?

02:37.740 --> 02:41.327
-All that's pointless if it goes away now.
-So, what am I supposed to do?

02:41.411 --> 02:43.329
I have friends on Coach
who owe me a favor.

02:43.413 --> 02:46.916
-It could be a fresh start for you.
-There's no such thing as a fresh start.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.669
It's an easy job.
Craig T. Nelson's balder by the day.

02:49.752 --> 02:51.713
What if I say n-- no?

02:51.796 --> 02:54.591
Nobody is asking you, Sharona.

02:57.260 --> 02:59.470
BoJack Horseman,
would you like to share? I...

02:59.554 --> 03:01.431
[stammers] I'm sorry.
I don't know who you are.

03:01.514 --> 03:04.434
This is anonymous.
BoJack Horseman? Who's that?

03:04.517 --> 03:05.560
[sighs]

03:07.312 --> 03:09.230
Um, yeah. Um...

03:09.439 --> 03:12.525
I'm BoJack and, uh...

03:12.609 --> 03:14.736
God, this feels so dumb.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.530
And I'm an alcoholic.

03:17.614 --> 03:19.032
[all] Hi, BoJack!

03:22.952 --> 03:24.704
Look, I can't go to the Galapagos.

03:24.787 --> 03:27.040
Guy, you have to.
This is an important job.

03:27.123 --> 03:30.335
[laughs] It's the National Geographic
Swimsuit Edition.

03:30.418 --> 03:33.171
They want me shooting behind-the-scenes
video of turtles in bikinis.

03:33.254 --> 03:35.173
Seems unimportant in light
of what you've been dealing with.

03:35.256 --> 03:36.674
What I'm dealing with?

03:36.758 --> 03:38.635
Your psychiatrist said you're depressed.

03:38.718 --> 03:42.138
Okay, yeah, I've been a little depressed.
But I'm not like depressed.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.806
I don't have depression.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.350
You're smoking three packs a day,

03:45.433 --> 03:47.435
you've been wearing the same
pajama bottoms for weeks...

03:47.518 --> 03:49.270
This is all part of my writing process.

03:49.354 --> 03:50.897
My best stuff comes out
when I hate myself.

03:50.980 --> 03:53.358
[chuckles]
What stuff? No stuff is coming out.

03:53.566 --> 03:54.567
[scoffs]

03:55.777 --> 03:59.656
I'd feel better if you just tried
the medication your doctor prescribed.

03:59.739 --> 04:00.907
Well, I'd feel worse.

04:00.990 --> 04:04.035
They put me on Prozac in college
and I was so calm and boring,

04:04.118 --> 04:05.370
I didn't even wanna LiveJournal.

04:05.453 --> 04:08.790
And then Dawson's Creek got bad because
there was no one to speak truth to power.

04:09.165 --> 04:11.084
Dawson's Creek did not get bad.

04:11.167 --> 04:14.212
You just started taking antidepressants,
which you should also do now.

04:14.295 --> 04:16.839
It sucks. It made me break out.
I gained weight.

04:16.923 --> 04:20.885
What if you leave and come back
to this person you don't even recognize?

04:20.969 --> 04:22.762
I don't even recognize you now.

04:23.513 --> 04:26.641
You're making this a bigger thing
than it is. I'll be fine.

04:27.642 --> 04:29.727
Don't fall for one of those models.

04:29.811 --> 04:31.479
I'm a one-woman man.

04:31.562 --> 04:33.648
If that woman happens
to be a turtle in a two-piece,

04:33.731 --> 04:35.566
-that's just destiny.
-[chuckles]

04:36.192 --> 04:37.235
[sighs]

04:37.318 --> 04:38.152
[knocks on door]

04:38.236 --> 04:42.532
[sighs] You're the most beautiful person
in the world to me. You know that, right?

04:42.615 --> 04:43.825
[chuckles]

04:45.994 --> 04:47.036
[groans]

04:49.914 --> 04:52.041
These strike negotiations
have lasted so long,

04:52.125 --> 04:53.793
it's like Reds in this boardroom.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.837
Remember Reds? Two VHS tapes.

04:55.920 --> 04:58.673
That's too many tapes, I said,
but no one listens to Lenny.

04:59.340 --> 05:00.216
How's this look?

05:00.758 --> 05:02.510
Generous, but you're making up
the projected loss

05:02.593 --> 05:05.722
by excising office birthday cakes.
That's unacceptable.

05:05.805 --> 05:07.557
Everybody hates office parties.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.851
Everyone hates the mysterious
dried fruit cubes in trail mix

05:09.934 --> 05:12.145
but we still eat them after the other nuts
and seeds are gone

05:12.228 --> 05:14.689
because in our undervalued,
overworked existence,

05:14.772 --> 05:16.733
we're desperate
for any morsel of satisfaction,

05:16.816 --> 05:19.360
whether that be cake,
unidentifiable orange fruit shards

05:19.444 --> 05:21.279
or the occasional kind word from our boss.

05:21.404 --> 05:23.698
I like cake.
They can print those pictures on them now.

05:23.781 --> 05:24.741
What's the issue here?

05:24.824 --> 05:28.286
Fine. But we're grouping birthdays
so they only happen once a month.

05:28.369 --> 05:30.997
We accept those terms.
We're left with one final issue.

05:31.080 --> 05:34.250
Your insistence assistants
be not treated like garbage?

05:34.709 --> 05:38.671
From this day forth, all assistants
will be treated like recycling.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.131
Right next to the garbage,

05:40.214 --> 05:44.844
but with an understanding that one day,
they may be up-cycled to a higher status.

05:44.927 --> 05:47.472
Like a bunch of seatbelts
that got turned into a purse.

05:47.555 --> 05:50.099
Or a license plate that gets turned
into a purse. Right, Lenny?

05:50.183 --> 05:52.018
Sure, sure. I'm green.

05:52.101 --> 05:54.437
-We're amenable to these terms.
-Oh.

05:58.691 --> 06:01.736
-Judah. I meant to reach out--
-There's no need to explain,

06:01.819 --> 06:03.571
I know you're very busy
with work and Ruthie.

06:03.654 --> 06:05.239
[chuckles] You have no idea.

06:05.323 --> 06:06.407
I have some idea.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.743
You talked about it quite often
during the negotiations.

06:08.826 --> 06:12.372
This strike has been the most time I've
been able to spend with Ruthie since...

06:12.455 --> 06:14.248
-[coos]
-...ever.

06:14.332 --> 06:16.376
I also feel an ambivalence
about the strike ending.

06:16.459 --> 06:18.503
The negotiations have been
quite invigorating.

06:18.586 --> 06:20.838
And now you're just gonna ride off
into the sunset?

06:21.047 --> 06:23.049
No, the sun sets in the west.

06:23.132 --> 06:26.427
I'm riding east to my Atwater cottage.
[grunts] Goodbye.

06:26.511 --> 06:27.887
-Judah!
-Yes?

06:27.970 --> 06:30.264
You're the best assistant I ever had.

06:30.598 --> 06:33.351
You don't need ever in that sentence.
It's implied.

06:33.434 --> 06:34.435
[grunting]

06:35.311 --> 06:36.145
[sighs]

06:37.021 --> 06:39.482
-[indistinct chattering]
-[BoJack groans]

06:39.899 --> 06:41.234
[exhales]

06:41.317 --> 06:43.778
-Hey! Oh, uh...
-Excuse me.

06:44.654 --> 06:45.571
Mm.

06:50.785 --> 06:53.121
Thank you for meeting me here.
I can't be at my house.

06:53.204 --> 06:54.831
Just reminds me
of what an asshole I've been.

06:55.164 --> 06:58.042
Makes sense. Your house reminds me
of what an asshole you've been, too.

06:58.126 --> 06:59.794
-[camera shutter clicking]
-Uh... what are you doing?

06:59.877 --> 07:03.089
I'm updating my asexual dating profile
with some fresh pics.

07:03.172 --> 07:07.051
There's still no one else on the app,
but when they join, I wanna be ready.

07:07.135 --> 07:10.972
Look at this busted photo.
It's from over a year ago.

07:13.141 --> 07:14.308
Yeah, you gotta stay current.

07:14.392 --> 07:17.770
Oh, man, they always ask for your job.
Oh, I actually have a job!

07:17.854 --> 07:19.230
Hype man for babies.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.065
You've really taken to this
nanny thing, huh?

07:21.149 --> 07:24.902
I love it. It's so amazing
to hold a baby and look at it sleep

07:24.986 --> 07:27.613
and think, "This is a perfect thing."

07:27.738 --> 07:30.616
-I can't imagine.
-It's weird to think that at one point,

07:30.700 --> 07:33.202
someone held me in their hands
and thought,

07:33.286 --> 07:37.206
"I'm going to love this kid forever,"
you know? What happened?

07:37.290 --> 07:38.291
What happened to what?

07:38.499 --> 07:40.501
I don't know. Moms are weird, right?

07:40.710 --> 07:43.129
Um... Yeah, moms are weird.

07:43.504 --> 07:47.049
So, what are you gonna do now?
Just keep getting lunch with your friends?

07:47.133 --> 07:48.593
There was a stewardess in the meeting.

07:48.718 --> 07:52.096
She was talking about how every day,
she wakes up in a different place.

07:52.180 --> 07:54.265
I thought, "That sounds perfect."

07:54.348 --> 07:56.225
Every city a clean slate?

07:56.309 --> 07:57.226
Stewardess?

07:57.351 --> 08:01.022
I think the preferred term
is flight servant.

08:01.105 --> 08:03.107
[soft music playing]

08:17.038 --> 08:18.915
To us! And depression!

08:18.998 --> 08:22.585
[chuckles] Yes, but before I drink to that
and then depart with you

08:22.668 --> 08:24.587
on a cross-country tour
of speaking engagements

08:24.670 --> 08:26.422
as the quote-unquote "Face of Depression,"

08:26.506 --> 08:29.133
there is something I feel
I must get off my chest.

08:29.300 --> 08:32.261
As it says on the cover of my last single
"You Can Tell Me Anything,"

08:32.345 --> 08:33.471
you can tell me anything.

08:33.554 --> 08:36.974
-I am not depressed.
-[gasps]

08:37.058 --> 08:38.559
Wait. How can you know that?

08:38.643 --> 08:40.853
Well, I feel very happy.

08:40.937 --> 08:42.104
Oh, I know.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.440
[sighs] Just as I suspected, half-full!

08:44.565 --> 08:46.609
Hmm. That is a troubling development.

08:46.692 --> 08:48.027
And right before our tour!

08:48.110 --> 08:51.197
I would be quite upset by this
if I were at all prone to depression,

08:51.280 --> 08:53.533
which, as we've just established,
I am not.

08:53.616 --> 08:56.619
But isn't it possible that
you are depressed and just don't know it?

08:56.702 --> 08:59.205
Well, I do frequently not know things.

08:59.288 --> 09:02.291
According to the literature for this tour
that I did not read

09:02.375 --> 09:04.502
but had my mom peruse
and then paraphrase for me,

09:04.585 --> 09:08.130
people who seem happy can actually
be the most depressed.

09:08.214 --> 09:09.882
Oh, no! I seem very happy!

09:09.966 --> 09:12.343
-I know.
-But wait! You seem happy, too!

09:12.426 --> 09:14.387
Oh, no, does that mean I'm also depressed?

09:14.470 --> 09:17.515
-Oh, good thing we're going on this tour.
-We gotta get the word out.

09:19.767 --> 09:22.019
-A cinnabunny and a coffee, please.
-3.25.

09:24.313 --> 09:25.147
Four and five.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.483
As Gandhi says, "Make the change you wish
to see in the world."

09:27.567 --> 09:30.820
Goodbye, change. Good luck out there.
I'll miss you.

09:30.903 --> 09:32.446
-Uh, what?
-It's for the best. Go.

09:32.530 --> 09:35.032
Just go, please.
Don't make it harder than it has to be.

09:35.116 --> 09:36.117
Okay.

09:43.291 --> 09:45.668
[birds chirping]

09:45.751 --> 09:48.879
[thunder rumbling]

09:48.963 --> 09:51.257
-What is depression?
-Depression.

09:51.340 --> 09:55.177
-Who is depression?
-You or someone you love.

09:55.386 --> 09:59.140
-Where is depression?
-A grassy field, perhaps.

09:59.223 --> 10:04.103
If any of these words describe you
or your feelings, you may suffer from...

10:04.186 --> 10:05.563
-Depression.
-...depression.

10:08.149 --> 10:09.483
[doorbell rings]

10:10.651 --> 10:12.653
-BoJack?
-Surprise!

10:14.447 --> 10:17.158
-Uh, is this a bad time or...?
-No.

10:17.241 --> 10:18.868
It's just...

10:19.076 --> 10:21.120
Heat's broken. Let's go for a walk.

10:24.290 --> 10:26.792
-Why didn't you tell me you were coming?
-I didn't know.

10:26.876 --> 10:30.463
I was in LA and I didn't want to be, so...

10:30.838 --> 10:32.715
-I'm glad you're here.
-You doing okay?

10:32.923 --> 10:35.676
I'm doing great.
I have this wonderful boyfriend.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.970
I got an advance
on a book of personal essays.

10:38.054 --> 10:39.639
Me, personal essays.

10:39.722 --> 10:41.557
I mean, who am I? Sloane Crosley?

10:41.641 --> 10:44.185
-Who's Sloane Crosley?
-Good point. Who's Sloane Crosley?

10:44.268 --> 10:46.187
Yeah, who is Sloane Crosley?

10:46.270 --> 10:47.229
Exactly.

10:48.064 --> 10:50.316
But the headline is you're doing great?

10:50.399 --> 10:51.442
So great.

10:51.984 --> 10:53.110
[slurps]

10:54.737 --> 10:56.739
-Can I crash at your apartment?
-No!

11:00.951 --> 11:02.787
-I think I'm depressed.
-Yeah?

11:02.870 --> 11:05.331
It started when I was having trouble
with my book,

11:05.414 --> 11:06.707
and then it kind of snowballed

11:06.791 --> 11:10.544
into my boyfriend saying
I should take antidepressants.

11:10.628 --> 11:12.672
-Are you going to?
-What's the point?

11:12.755 --> 11:15.758
Of antidepressants? I believe the point
is to be antidepressed.

11:15.841 --> 11:21.972
Sure. Or you just flip over the nothing
and underneath there's more nothing.

11:22.056 --> 11:26.519
Then you flip over that nothing
and there's more nothing underneath that.

11:26.602 --> 11:29.730
So, you just keep flipping over nothings,
all your life,

11:29.814 --> 11:32.400
because you keep thinking
under all that nothing,

11:32.483 --> 11:36.153
there's gotta be something,
but all you find is nothing.

11:36.654 --> 11:40.616
Sure, but you flip over this pizza box,
uh, and look, a couch!

11:40.700 --> 11:41.909
We're gonna break up soon anyway.

11:41.992 --> 11:44.161
There's only so long before he gets tired
of the real me.

11:44.245 --> 11:45.705
The real you being...?

11:45.788 --> 11:46.914
Ta-da!

11:47.873 --> 11:50.501
You know, someone got really mad
at me recently...

11:50.584 --> 11:52.128
Mad? At you?

11:52.211 --> 11:53.087
I know, shocking.

11:53.170 --> 11:55.464
And he said, "BoJack, you ruin everything.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.633
-That's what you are."
-Oof.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.468
And it actually took him saying it
out loud

11:59.552 --> 12:03.389
for me to realize how stupid that is,

12:03.472 --> 12:05.599
even though I believed it for so long.

12:05.683 --> 12:09.019
I bought into this idea that I was a thing
that couldn't be changed.

12:09.103 --> 12:12.356
So, the reason I came to Chicago is...

12:12.857 --> 12:14.024
I wanted to thank you

12:14.108 --> 12:16.902
for believing in me when I didn't,

12:16.986 --> 12:19.822
and for encouraging me
to accept the help I needed.

12:20.030 --> 12:20.990
Hmm.

12:21.073 --> 12:22.450
[melancholic music playing]

12:25.453 --> 12:29.081
[inhales, groans]

12:30.708 --> 12:31.625
Hmm.

12:36.714 --> 12:38.716
-[wind howling]
-[shudders]

12:49.852 --> 12:50.686
Hmm.

12:50.770 --> 12:53.022
-[groans] Mm?
-[yelps]

12:56.817 --> 13:01.113
So, I'm really glad you're here,
but a little notice next time?

13:01.197 --> 13:02.448
Oh, yeah, sorry.

13:02.531 --> 13:04.325
I already made plans with Tawnie.

13:04.408 --> 13:05.701
-Hey.
-[screams]

13:05.785 --> 13:08.162
Hi, Tawnie. Why are you in the backseat?

13:08.329 --> 13:11.999
Hollyhock and I are in a fight right now.
It's both minute and massive.

13:12.082 --> 13:14.251
How can it be minute and massive?

13:14.376 --> 13:16.921
It's a paradox.
It's Sylvia Plath wearing Saint Laurent.

13:17.004 --> 13:18.422
[groans] Wesleyan.

13:20.382 --> 13:23.385
Anyway, we're going to a show.
You're welcome to join us.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.513
Great. A music show? I love music.

13:25.596 --> 13:30.309
[discordant sounds playing]

13:30.476 --> 13:32.728
Oh, God, is this what music sounds like
when you're sober?

13:32.812 --> 13:34.855
-Do I hate music?
-No, this sucks.

13:34.939 --> 13:37.316
I'm just here because
I wanted to cheer up Tawnie.

13:37.399 --> 13:38.567
I thought you were in a fight.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.778
Yeah, but I still don't want her
to feel bad.

13:40.861 --> 13:43.989
She's my best friend.
They cancelled all the drama classes.

13:44.156 --> 13:45.074
What? Why?

13:45.157 --> 13:48.994
The acting professor quit.
He got cast in a regional commercial.

13:49.078 --> 13:50.871
And he quit? Wow.

13:50.955 --> 13:53.457
So, yeah, now Tawnie's gotta
change her major,

13:53.541 --> 13:55.084
which I get why that sucks,

13:55.167 --> 13:57.044
but don't take it out on me.

13:57.127 --> 14:00.673
I'll bet a lot of actors would love
to teach at a place like this.

14:00.756 --> 14:02.258
They're not looking for a replacement?

14:02.341 --> 14:06.053
Maybe they are. I don't know.
What do I look like, the Wesleyan Argus?

14:06.136 --> 14:08.681
Okay, I don't wanna be fighting anymore,
so can we just drop it?

14:08.806 --> 14:11.976
-You always do this.
-I'm trying to move past it.

14:12.059 --> 14:14.186
You said we were gonna meet
at Pi Café for dinner.

14:14.270 --> 14:15.354
-I forgot.
-Yeah.

14:15.521 --> 14:19.108
That hurt my feelings.
Now we're just supposed to move past it?

14:19.191 --> 14:20.901
Ah, I see. A teachable moment.

14:20.985 --> 14:23.028
Hollyhock, people will disappoint you.

14:23.112 --> 14:25.489
You're always mad at me.
There's nothing I can say.

14:25.573 --> 14:27.366
Yes, some wounds will never be healed.

14:27.491 --> 14:28.909
You could say sorry.

14:29.034 --> 14:31.412
-Would it even matter?
-No, words are meaningless.

14:31.495 --> 14:35.583
Yes. You do this thing where
you don't think you can ever be forgiven,

14:35.666 --> 14:37.126
so you don't apologize,

14:37.209 --> 14:39.920
but I can't forgive you
if you don't say you're sorry.

14:40.045 --> 14:42.172
Okay, I'm... sorry.

14:42.256 --> 14:44.216
Thank you. That's all I wanted.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.968
-I'm sorry.
-I love you.

14:46.051 --> 14:47.261
I love you, too.

14:47.344 --> 14:48.971
Come here. Mm!

14:49.054 --> 14:49.889
That's it?

14:49.972 --> 14:51.932
-Come on, let's dance. [chuckles]
-Yeah!

14:52.266 --> 14:54.602
-Uh... [groans]
-[Hollyhock] BoJack!

14:54.685 --> 14:56.395
I'm really glad you came to visit.

14:56.478 --> 14:58.439
-Where are you going next?
-I don't know.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.774
-Where is not winter?
-California?

15:00.900 --> 15:02.735
No, I can't go back there. Not yet.

15:02.818 --> 15:04.028
-Florida?
-[groans]

15:04.111 --> 15:06.530
-Arizona?
-Some parts of Texas?

15:06.614 --> 15:07.573
[groans]

15:11.201 --> 15:14.288
I'm telling you, people come
to the airport just to eat these things.

15:14.371 --> 15:16.582
But if their houses were made
of cinnamon and dough,

15:16.665 --> 15:18.083
they wouldn't have to go anywhere!

15:18.167 --> 15:21.795
They could eat and live happily
in their Cinnabungalow.

15:21.879 --> 15:25.132
Well, I think it's a great idea
and this customer thinks so, too.

15:25.215 --> 15:26.967
-Right, Lonely Horse Guy?
-Sure.

15:27.051 --> 15:30.721
He loves it! You better get in on this
before there's a bidding war.

15:30.804 --> 15:34.224
[sighs] No, I'm not dating anyone.
Stay on topic, Mom.

15:36.852 --> 15:39.355
And Amelia Earhart flew through the skies

15:39.438 --> 15:44.360
until one day, she made it to the sun
and everybody cheered. The end.

15:44.443 --> 15:45.277
[knocking on door]

15:46.445 --> 15:47.905
-[Princess Carolyn] Oh.
-Hey.

15:48.072 --> 15:52.493
I'm out of rehab and I realized I never
got you a baby shower gift, so... here.

15:52.576 --> 15:56.205
I'm registered at Cubs 'R' Us
and Baby Hole, but thanks.

15:56.330 --> 15:57.790
If I'm gonna live in that house again,

15:57.873 --> 16:00.292
I wanna get rid of the things
that remind me of my old life.

16:00.376 --> 16:03.420
Look what Uncle BoJack
brought you, Ruthie.

16:03.504 --> 16:07.466
It's a 1970s pop art interpretation
of the Narcissus myth.

16:07.549 --> 16:09.134
How appropriate for a baby.

16:09.218 --> 16:11.011
Narcissus?
I thought the painting was about me.

16:11.095 --> 16:13.722
But enough about your baby,
I also have a favor to ask.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.057
Of course you do.

16:15.140 --> 16:17.851
There's this drama professor job
at Wesleyan.

16:17.935 --> 16:21.605
They need a reference to tell them
that I know what I'm talking about,

16:21.689 --> 16:23.482
that I'm dependable and passionate.

16:23.565 --> 16:26.360
So, I thought that you could do
what you've been doing for 20 years

16:26.443 --> 16:27.569
and lie about me.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.279
I'll be back at the office tomorrow.

16:29.363 --> 16:32.241
But have them call my cell
because my assistant is terrible.

16:32.324 --> 16:33.283
[cooing]

16:33.367 --> 16:36.578
-Oh, shit, it walks already?
-She started a few days ago.

16:37.079 --> 16:38.664
[sniffles] Oh.

16:38.747 --> 16:41.500
It's okay, she sucks at it now,
but she'll get better at it.

16:41.583 --> 16:44.253
I'm gonna miss everything.
We have this connection now.

16:44.336 --> 16:46.505
What if that goes away
when I go back to work?

16:46.588 --> 16:47.506
So don't go back.

16:47.589 --> 16:52.177
What? I'm dying here, BoJack.
I need my job. I love my job.

16:52.261 --> 16:53.429
-Okay.
-It's just...

16:53.512 --> 16:56.223
There's always so much stupid bullshit
to take care of there.

16:56.306 --> 16:58.767
Aren't you the boss?
Why are you doing the stupid bullshit?

16:58.851 --> 16:59.685
I don't know.

16:59.768 --> 17:03.731
Hey, my only responsibility right now
is to not drink and I'm barely getting by.

17:03.814 --> 17:06.817
You are producing a show,
running a company,

17:06.900 --> 17:09.862
catering to your clients,
raising a child, a Todd.

17:09.945 --> 17:12.990
You need your own Princess Carolyn
to take care of you.

17:14.116 --> 17:15.034
[Ruthie babbling]

17:15.659 --> 17:18.037
-[both gasp]
-Oh, no! That thing was priceless.

17:18.120 --> 17:21.040
Ah, we'll tape it back together
and call it a Rauschenberg.

17:23.751 --> 17:27.004
I've been back in LA two months.
When am I gonna hear about this job?

17:27.087 --> 17:31.258
I have other offers, you know.
UCLA, USC, UTI.

17:31.341 --> 17:36.138
[groans] Mr. Horseman, we have to allow
other applicants time to apply.

17:36.221 --> 17:37.806
Raven-Symoné is circling.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.601
Raven! She's circling around,
portending my doom?

17:40.684 --> 17:42.686
Is she gonna swoop in
and peck out my chances?

17:42.770 --> 17:45.606
That is so... like her.

17:47.149 --> 17:49.359
I still can't get comfortable in my house.

17:49.443 --> 17:53.363
It's huge and perfect, but it feels
like the worst place on earth.

17:53.447 --> 17:56.450
No offense, Benny, living in
your storage locker sounds pretty rough.

17:56.533 --> 17:58.619
Every day, it just keeps getting better.

17:58.744 --> 18:00.204
God, you're killing me, Benny.

18:00.287 --> 18:02.956
My house reminds me
of the horse I was before.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.583
I don't wanna be him again.

18:04.666 --> 18:07.211
But it's the same house, the same city,

18:07.294 --> 18:11.256
just nothing's changed,
so how am I supposed to?

18:17.346 --> 18:18.764
-Hey.
-Sharona, I--

18:18.889 --> 18:21.767
We don't need to do
whatever your sad eyes are asking for.

18:21.850 --> 18:23.185
It was a long time ago.

18:23.268 --> 18:24.186
I'd like to try to--

18:24.269 --> 18:26.271
The last time I saw you
was my rock bottom.

18:26.355 --> 18:27.773
I've been sober ever since.

18:27.856 --> 18:29.191
So it all worked out, okay?

18:29.274 --> 18:31.026
Please, just let me say it.

18:31.193 --> 18:33.862
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.950
It was nice of you
to bring Panda Express for everyone.

18:38.033 --> 18:40.119
-Right. Everyone.

Okay. I dye my hair.
Nobody makes fun of Dennis Rodman.

-I look old.

and to quote Raven, "Nevermore."

19:05.727 --> 19:08.564
Spring semester starts next week.
Can you be here?

19:10.899 --> 19:12.317
I'll be on the next plane.

19:12.401 --> 19:15.195
Welcome to Wesleyan, Professor.

19:19.658 --> 19:22.327
-Is it like a Jesus thing?
-No, it's not that. I told you.

19:22.411 --> 19:25.789
I'm just confused, is all.
Because I thought you liked me.

19:25.873 --> 19:28.667
I do, but I was very clear
there are certain things

19:28.834 --> 19:30.002
that I'm not interested in.

19:30.085 --> 19:32.462
[man] So, why did you go out with me
in the first place?

19:32.588 --> 19:36.800
-Because I like you! But it's complicated.
-And you're sure it's not a Jesus thing?

19:36.884 --> 19:39.636
Fine, if it helps end this conversation,
yes, it's a Jesus thing.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.388
Hey, I admire your devotion.

19:41.471 --> 19:44.183
What would Jesus do? Not this guy.
[chuckles]

19:45.809 --> 19:48.228
-It's not a Jesus thing.
-I figured.

19:48.312 --> 19:49.938
I don't wanna presume anything,

19:50.022 --> 19:52.024
but there's an app
you might be interested in.

21:34.376 --> 21:37.838
They sure have been spending
a lot of time together, huh, our teens?

21:37.921 --> 21:39.965
[in normal voice]
I hope they're not having S-E...

21:40.048 --> 21:42.592
Excuse me. [sobbing] It's just--

21:43.093 --> 21:44.928
I'm so overwhelmed.

21:45.345 --> 21:48.557
-This is the best day! [crying]
-Oh.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.600
Oh, God. Oh.

21:51.476 --> 21:53.937
He's the National Face of Depression.

21:55.772 --> 21:59.318
[woman] We have rescheduled your flight
to Connecticut for 8:45 a.m. tomorrow.

21:59.401 --> 22:00.902
Please stay on the line for a survey

22:00.986 --> 22:03.655
that directly determines whether
or not I get fired--

22:03.739 --> 22:04.573
[phone beeps]

22:05.032 --> 22:06.033
Hmm.

22:07.242 --> 22:08.160
Hmm.

22:15.125 --> 22:15.959
Hmm.

22:16.043 --> 22:17.669
["Take Me Down Easy" playing]

22:17.753 --> 22:18.962
-[knocks on door]
-Come in.

22:19.421 --> 22:20.255
Pardon my state.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.841
I was mid-trek up the Los Angeles Crest
when I received your text.

22:22.924 --> 22:24.509
-You had a question for me?
-Yes.

22:24.593 --> 22:26.345
Would you be interested in interviewing

22:26.428 --> 22:29.181
for a job here
as VIM's Chief of Operations?

22:29.264 --> 22:31.350
You'd be a partner
with a stake in the company,

22:31.433 --> 22:33.101
and a birthday cake just for you.

22:33.185 --> 22:34.853
I would be interested in that interview.

22:34.936 --> 22:36.188
-Do you want the job?
-Yes.

22:36.271 --> 22:37.481
Great. Interview done.

22:37.564 --> 22:40.442
Your first task is
to clear my schedule every third Friday.

22:40.525 --> 22:42.235
I'm taking them off
to be with my daughter.

22:42.319 --> 22:44.488
And there's a weird burnt smell
coming from the copy room.

22:44.571 --> 22:47.157
I'm familiar with that smell.
I'll investigate right away.

22:47.574 --> 22:48.492
Thanks, Judah.

22:49.117 --> 22:50.327
My pleasure.

-Oh.

23:02.005 --> 23:03.131
Huh.

23:04.216 --> 23:05.717
[cell phone buzzes, beeps]

23:05.801 --> 23:06.760
Hi, Mister!

23:06.843 --> 23:09.221
Pickles! Other than being away from you,

23:09.304 --> 23:12.808
I gotta say I am having
the time of my life being depressed!

23:12.891 --> 23:14.101
I'm so glad.

23:14.184 --> 23:17.687
I sense a sadness in your voice,
my gherkin. But maybe not?

23:17.771 --> 23:19.689
At this point,
I really don't know the difference.

23:19.773 --> 23:21.149
You sensed correctly.

23:21.233 --> 23:25.779
I thought it'd be easy to get even,
but I've slept with 32 guys now,

23:25.862 --> 23:28.615
if you count the two sets of twins
as two and not four.

23:28.698 --> 23:29.533
I do.

23:29.616 --> 23:32.786
And the truth is,
none of them are like my Mister.

23:32.869 --> 23:35.747
I just wish I could cheat on you with you.

23:35.831 --> 23:37.290
-Mm.

23:37.374 --> 23:38.959
-Hmm?
