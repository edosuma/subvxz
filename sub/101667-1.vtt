03:01.000 --> 03:03.500
Holly? Holly? Dev'eri?

03:22.800 --> 03:26.500
It has been here for 20 minutes when we arrive
in the room I want you to know first ...

06:01.749 --> 06:03.163
Get me out.

07:19.200 --> 07:20.300
All right, calm ...

07:24.200 --> 07:25.300
Everything is alright.

07:25.978 --> 07:32.162
The brain death of the host is confirmed,
our connection was completely
deleted. We finished.

07:47.500 --> 07:48.500
You?

07:50.592 --> 07:53.635
I'm sorry, I haven't come back yet.

07:53.800 --> 07:57.516
- All right. You need a break?
- No, it's okay. Let's end it soon ...

07:58.049 --> 07:58.949
Let's continue then ...

08:05.914 --> 08:09.200
It's my grandfather's pipe.

08:10.670 --> 08:17.415
Ele morreu antes de eu nascer e o meu pai deu ele para mim.

08:18.500 --> 08:19.200
The next.

08:22.705 --> 08:30.727
This is an old souvenir I killed her
one day when I was a child and ...

08:30.927 --> 08:33.759
I felt guilty...

08:34.642 --> 08:38.751
- I still feel guilty.
- Very well.

08:39.529 --> 08:40.429
The next.

08:48.312 --> 08:49.726
This is not mine.

08:50.974 --> 08:52.404
Safety?

08:53.644 --> 08:54.822
Never seen before.

09:02.500 --> 09:03.200
Very well.

09:05.465 --> 09:10.495
The results are normal in general.

09:11.521 --> 09:19.200
No evidence of false psyche
of your time as Ms. Holly Burgman.

09:21.690 --> 09:22.933
You look surprised.

09:24.139 --> 09:25.738
Is there anything you want to highlight?

09:26.939 --> 09:27.939
Clicked down ...

09:28.635 --> 09:31.200
... anomaly during the interface?

09:31.489 --> 09:33.289
No, no, I'm fine.

09:33.981 --> 09:35.831
It is important not to keep things.

09:41.200 --> 09:42.200
I said I'm fine.

09:44.952 --> 09:45.852
OK then.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.920
Our next contract is almost over.

09:51.072 --> 09:53.072
And it's a big thing.

09:53.271 --> 09:57.818
I can't let my star lose control.

10:04.688 --> 10:06.988
I'd like to take some time.

10:08.500 --> 10:10.000
Time for what?

10:10.300 --> 10:12.000
I talked to Michael about it.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
IS...

10:14.087 --> 10:17.039
... I told him I was going to take some time.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Michael?

10:24.540 --> 10:26.288
No, it's that ...

10:30.200 --> 10:36.200
You and Michael ... are separated.

10:41.842 --> 10:42.842
Yes sure.

10:52.878 --> 10:54.799
But I talked to him.

10:56.720 --> 10:58.820
You are no longer safe with him, are you?

11:01.000 --> 11:03.200
You told me yourself that it had become a danger.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.500
Did I say this?

11:34.000 --> 11:35.200
Oh, honey.

11:37.500 --> 11:41.500
Oh, honey.!

11:42.800 --> 11:44.500
What ... what do you have there?

11:45.200 --> 11:47.500
What ... Hi, honey, what do you got there?

11:48.239 --> 11:55.192
God, I'm hungry, I'm really hungry, Michael.

11:56.500 --> 12:00.500
God, I'm really hungry, Michael.

12:17.033 --> 12:21.278
- Mom!
- Hi honey! - Tas?

12:24.892 --> 12:29.230
- We have something to eat.
- Well, I'm really hungry.

12:38.483 --> 12:40.301
Hey, down here.

12:52.200 --> 12:58.319
- How was your trip?
- Well. It is really boring.

12:58.963 --> 13:01.663
You have no idea how happy I am to go back to town.

13:02.126 --> 13:05.426
How's it going with the newspaper?
How is it going?

13:05.720 --> 13:07.286
Go on.

13:09.968 --> 13:14.985
Although Daniel says the new publisher
is a historian of social sciences.

13:15.098 --> 13:17.182
What is that?63

13:17.508 --> 13:22.736
He's an old, stupid guy
who will not like what I write.

13:23.283 --> 13:24.542
You are old enough.

13:25.177 --> 13:27.051
Very nice.

13:27.913 --> 13:32.500
... new revelations in the shocking case of the murder
of lawyer Elliot Matza on Sunday evening.

13:32.624 --> 13:37.056
<i> The police revealed the identity of the killer,
23-year-old Holly Burgman.</i>

13:37.200 --> 13:40.138
<i> Burgman worked as a receptionist. </i>
at the Blue Light Sky Lounge,

13:40.200 --> 13:42.883
<i> where witnesses said she appeared. </i>
suddenly and stabbed Matza several times ...

13:43.054 --> 13:45.890
What does the python drink to sleep?

13:46.199 --> 13:47.599
I don't know, what do they drink?

13:47.767 --> 13:48.867
Tea with herbs.

13:53.528 --> 13:56.700
- What have you got there?
- Dad bought it for me.

13:57.200 --> 14:00.190
- I can make him dance.
- Yup?

14:17.450 --> 14:19.959
How did you get so smart?

14:26.433 --> 14:29.591
- Did I ever tell you the new story with Greg?
- No. Please tell me.

14:29.729 --> 14:34.917
I went to his office and he was there
with the new intern.

14:35.096 --> 14:41.998
The shirt half-open, Indian music at full volume,
and spoke of the shocking force of the feminine principle

14:42.240 --> 14:51.021
This girl seemed traumatized by this
65 year old guy with hairy chest ...

14:51.100 --> 14:54.520
- Yes, I remember that Greg's chest was very aggressive.
- Yes, it's a war crime.

14:54.652 --> 14:58.176
He was literally trying to touch her.

14:58.283 --> 15:05.709
I am convinced that it detaches itself from its body at night and wanders
for the corridors female dormitory wrapped in a bathrobe

15:05.942 --> 15:08.948
sticking his face between the thighs of the students.

15:09.111 --> 15:11.807
Only with menstruation.

15:12.186 --> 15:15.107
Is attracted to the smell of blood,
for iron deficiency

15:15.269 --> 15:19.855
which in this case can be fatal
because it leads to hair loss.

15:21.081 --> 15:26.107
Sorry, I didn't think ... I didn't think
that they would stay so long.

15:32.497 --> 15:34.969
Then ask him to leave.

16:17.231 --> 16:23.700
Girder, hi, I'm Vos, I just wanted to apologize.
Yesterday I was not in myself ...

16:23.819 --> 16:31.596
I guess I didn't share enough when
we took the test. Anyway, I'm ready now ...

16:31.776 --> 16:33.276
Call me.

16:34.800 --> 16:36.200
Yes, please call me.

16:41.700 --> 16:42.500
Who was?

16:42.720 --> 16:43.720
Work.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.700
I will have to travel again.

16:47.653 --> 16:50.723
- I thought they would give you some respite.
- Yeah ...

16:54.021 --> 16:56.236
Something else has come up.

16:56.817 --> 16:59.441
I want you to come back to live with us.

17:01.458 --> 17:02.621
I hate all this.

17:06.678 --> 17:07.678
Tas?

17:10.618 --> 17:11.618
Tas?

18:05.395 --> 18:06.895
Am I predicting you?

18:14.000 --> 18:15.466
I'm getting old.

18:16.797 --> 18:19.612
By now I barely recognize myself.

18:20.812 --> 18:24.412
I'm too old for the car, I can't stand the tension.

18:27.223 --> 18:34.153
And the more time passes, the more important it becomes
for me to find a replacement.

18:35.897 --> 18:37.897
And it would be you.

18:43.779 --> 18:47.258
Usually I don't misjudge people.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.299
It would be great.

18:49.889 --> 18:52.926
You have a very special nature.

18:53.200 --> 18:56.700
You find out when you work hard with someone.

18:58.898 --> 19:06.628
Yet still now, I can see
a small thread that comes out of your skull

19:06.676 --> 19:10.951
connecting to a life that I thought you had already abandoned.

19:11.200 --> 19:17.991
Sometimes it only takes this to lose
control, that little thought,

19:18.713 --> 19:20.573
a small fracture.

19:24.130 --> 19:31.621
I want to show you some photos of things they don't have
worked with work with Holly Burgman.

19:32.389 --> 19:35.065
Why stab Elliot Matza?

19:36.061 --> 19:38.561
You had been given a gun.119

19:44.000 --> 19:46.700
He seemed to adapt more to the character.

19:49.485 --> 19:51.485
Which character?

20:00.101 --> 20:01.448
Do you want this?

20:09.804 --> 20:10.804
Well.

20:11.953 --> 20:12.953
Well.

20:15.904 --> 20:18.863
Consider the profile of Collin Tate.

20:19.025 --> 20:23.072
Dead father. Absent mother.
No brothers.

20:23.200 --> 20:30.700
Spend cocaine for a few years, then fall in love
and engages with one of his wealthy clients, Ava Parse.

20:30.806 --> 20:33.632
Daughter of John Parse of Zoothroo.

20:33.751 --> 20:35.083
Zoothroo?

20:35.114 --> 20:39.404
Data extraction. A great company
outside the United States.

20:39.467 --> 20:41.065
The venue is local.

20:41.476 --> 20:47.414
But our deal is with Reid Parse's stepson,
John's stepson.

20:48.034 --> 20:49.856
And what is the narrative?

20:50.235 --> 20:58.735
Imagine Collin Tate as the unstable lover
who feels diminished by his new family.

20:58.962 --> 21:04.993
Ava has all the power in the relationship and is castrating him,
so start using drugs again,

21:05.084 --> 21:14.000
becoming even more unstable. And in the end he freaks out,
kills John, kills Ava and commits suicide.

21:14.501 --> 21:18.488
With Ava out of the game, Reid inherits everything, becomes CEO,
cries for the cameras, a simple tragedy, nobody will ask questions.

21:18.753 --> 21:25.838
becomes CEO, cries for the cameras,
a tragedy, nobody will ask questions.

21:26.234 --> 21:28.241
The pay is respectable.

21:28.553 --> 21:31.106
A shower of money.

21:31.283 --> 21:38.656
But the real goal, according to the corporation,
it is the zoothroo itself.

21:39.033 --> 21:44.190
Because when we have Reid, we will have the Company.

21:44.864 --> 21:45.864
Sure.

21:47.197 --> 21:48.665
Ok, when do you start?

24:04.728 --> 24:06.921
Problems?

24:07.623 --> 24:10.614
No problem.
I'll prepare it by going to the airport.

24:10.639 --> 24:13.207
Well. How long do we need?

24:13.300 --> 24:15.000
About four hours to prepare it.

24:17.200 --> 24:21.109
- And you?
- I'm ready, I'm fine.

24:23.302 --> 24:28.047
I'd like to remind you before I start.

24:28.700 --> 24:35.472
After the initial connection you will be trapped, not
you will be allowed to lose control during this performance.

24:35.545 --> 24:38.707
The deadline for completing the
mission will be John Parse's dinner.

24:38.752 --> 24:41.469
It is scheduled for the day after tomorrow evening.

24:42.032 --> 24:46.374
You have to use this time
to deal with Tate's instability.

24:46.595 --> 24:52.872
Dr. Mallasus has set up his compatibility
just three days, so there is no room for error.

24:53.169 --> 25:00.587
If we still have to hold you back, the damage to your brain
will reach category C, and I don't want to risk it.

25:00.729 --> 25:04.181
The plant begins to dissolve after five days.

25:04.323 --> 25:10.850
Use the calibration device at least once a day,
use it more if you suffer from persistent disorientation.

25:12.200 --> 25:16.272
Mr. Tate's girlfriend is Ava (Eva) not Ava.

25:16.763 --> 25:24.449
He suffers from irritable bowel. If you will have intense pain on the
right side of the abdomen will be considered normal.

25:24.933 --> 25:32.532
System synchronization will destroy
memories of the murder ...

25:38.557 --> 25:41.069
The respiratory threshold is normal.

25:41.622 --> 25:43.301
How are the levels this time?

25:43.688 --> 25:45.062
The levels are good,

25:45.164 --> 25:47.807
Keep me in depth, so there won't be any problems.

25:47.864 --> 25:51.143
Of course Mrs. Vos, I'll keep you pretty deep.

25:51.256 --> 25:54.511
Make sure you pull the trigger when you're done.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
And what the fuck does that mean?

25:57.360 --> 25:59.360
Go on.

26:13.877 --> 26:14.877
Ok ...

26:15.303 --> 26:18.110
Interface activated and we are at full power.

26:18.181 --> 26:20.446
It could be a somewhat abrupt jump.

26:20.491 --> 26:21.991
Just do it.

26:22.259 --> 26:23.259
As you wish.

31:08.403 --> 31:11.198
Can you heat the water for me?

31:12.287 --> 31:14.287
Sure.

31:26.091 --> 31:28.091
You have a good perfume.

31:28.696 --> 31:30.696
I need a shower.

31:39.868 --> 31:42.868
You are not in a good mood today.

31:44.743 --> 31:46.383
Have you seen my supplements?

31:46.689 --> 31:47.689
Supplements?

31:49.000 --> 31:52.675
There were proteins
in a box.

31:52.906 --> 31:58.309
I'm going to make damiana tea.
You will like it, it is an antidepressant.

31:59.846 --> 32:01.846
I haven't seen them.

32:05.063 --> 32:07.408
I didn't hear you come back last night.

32:07.715 --> 32:11.275
I haven't been able to take a flight before.
I have not slept almost anything.

32:11.539 --> 32:13.527
How was your trip?

32:14.200 --> 32:17.928
Exceptional ... the demonstration of the new
program was impressive.

32:18.055 --> 32:21.334
He liked the construction game in Ebonics.

32:21.897 --> 32:24.197
How did the rest of the shift go?

32:27.742 --> 32:29.742
What's wrong with you today?

32:31.018 --> 32:32.518
What do you mean?

32:33.131 --> 32:34.631
What do you mean?

32:35.660 --> 32:36.796
You are not...

32:45.192 --> 32:47.478
You are strange with me.

34:20.908 --> 34:21.908
Good morning.

34:22.027 --> 34:22.927
Mr. Tate.

34:23.165 --> 34:28.627
This week I want it on curtains and shutters.
The guide is already in your station.

34:31.221 --> 34:32.221
Tate.

34:32.309 --> 34:35.797
I've done it.
I fucked her and it was incredible.

34:36.813 --> 34:37.813
Did you do it?

34:37.955 --> 34:41.226
You know what these East Coast girls are like.

34:41.281 --> 34:44.281
Foi revoltante, inhuman and e nunca serei perdoado.
It was revolting, inhuman.

34:45.358 --> 34:51.280
And you? You managed to find the time
to have fun on a parallel project?

34:53.311 --> 34:55.811
No, no, Eddie, what do you say?

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
Good boy.

34:57.186 --> 35:02.208
I always thought it was your duty
morals have sex with the boss's daughter.

36:30.857 --> 36:32.689
Brown curtains.

36:33.866 --> 36:35.866
Ring sockets.

36:37.321 --> 36:38.370
Standard bar.

36:44.725 --> 36:45.725
Not visible.

36:51.526 --> 36:56.076
Translucent shutters.

36:57.430 --> 36:58.430
White fabric.

37:20.783 --> 37:22.783
Is something wrong Mr. Tate?

37:25.868 --> 37:27.868
You are advancing like a snail.

37:28.296 --> 37:29.517
Focus.

37:30.899 --> 37:31.899
Sorry.

37:37.106 --> 37:40.606
Translucent curtains.

37:43.134 --> 37:45.134
Bar not visible.

39:48.189 --> 39:52.189
Vos, please connect.

39:56.159 --> 39:57.159
I'm here.

39:58.064 --> 39:59.564
What happened?

40:01.072 --> 40:02.800
What do you mean?

40:02.895 --> 40:05.895
Your levels were too high and I couldn't find you.

40:07.465 --> 40:08.965
Nothing.

40:09.525 --> 40:12.647
I was on the spot I couldn't answer.

40:12.764 --> 40:16.375
- Were you at Zoothroo?
- Yup.

40:16.795 --> 40:21.793
I have just started my current shift.
Everything seems perfectly normal.

40:22.288 --> 40:24.788
No interference.

40:25.606 --> 40:27.426
I do not understand.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.523
Maybe you need to talk to the new technician.

40:30.672 --> 40:33.172
He would probably take a look at the controls.

40:33.470 --> 40:38.941
The levels were sketched. I'm having Dr. Mel do it
a deeper analysis.

40:39.103 --> 40:46.222
But I want you to let me know if
notice something, anything.

40:46.907 --> 40:48.907
We can not afford
no mistakes this time.

40:49.500 --> 40:52.500
Don't worry, I have everything under control.

40:58.072 --> 41:00.841
Hey, Tate.
Everything good?

41:01.706 --> 41:03.396
Yes why?238

41:03.923 --> 41:06.030
They say you are ..

41:07.000 --> 41:08.885
ran away from the place.

41:09.547 --> 41:11.705
- You do not look good.
- I'm fine.

41:12.637 --> 41:14.137
If you say so.

41:14.644 --> 41:20.031
Some of us will call to negotiate on Saturday.
And I'm sure your name is high on the list.

41:20.182 --> 41:23.459
But I guess you don't like the boss.

43:04.047 --> 43:08.477
- Where have you been?
- I do not know sorry.

43:08.572 --> 43:12.261
I forgot that the alarm clock was off
and I had to be late for work.

43:12.467 --> 43:14.467
You could have texted me.

43:15.246 --> 43:17.655
I was going to call the police.

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
Sorry.

43:26.985 --> 43:28.758
Come and make a line with us.

43:32.203 --> 43:35.983
I see you well, Collin, a splendor.

43:36.073 --> 43:40.075
- Stop that. - You don't have to stop.
I'll tell you if you have to stop.

43:40.189 --> 43:44.347
Well, I don't need to behave well,
it's part of my fucking nature.

43:44.456 --> 43:48.308
Let's celebrate Moira's promotion to Zoothroo.

43:49.297 --> 43:51.784
- Do not say anything?
- In Zoothroo?

43:52.500 --> 43:53.892
Pleased to meet you.

43:54.132 --> 43:55.132
We already know each other.

43:55.679 --> 43:57.679
It wasn't an apparently memorable encounter.

44:00.500 --> 44:01.753
When do you start?

44:01.805 --> 44:02.805
Yesterday.

44:03.289 --> 44:05.162
Ava told me that you are
downstairs.

44:05.317 --> 44:08.968
- Why do you want that job?
- Ava's father gave it to him.

44:09.592 --> 44:11.374
Your father is a sadist.

44:11.576 --> 44:14.576
Right on the floor where the employees
they are more exploited.

44:15.272 --> 44:21.793
My father has a habit of submitting
my boys to these tests.

44:22.737 --> 44:24.355
In this case...

44:24.388 --> 44:28.888
I know the psychic scars
Colin's will prove his innocence.

44:29.572 --> 44:37.097
Sorry, Ava, but why don't you tell the old man
to go fuck and then you go?

44:41.900 --> 44:42.900
Colin?

44:43.542 --> 44:45.042
Who's this?

44:49.178 --> 44:53.178
I guess his mind has to go off somewhere
time after thus violating the lives of others.

44:53.323 --> 44:57.671
Seriously, how many pussies do you see at
do I work every day? - Reeta ...

44:57.813 --> 45:01.513
Well ... I can only imagine
the stuff he sees over there.

45:02.000 --> 45:07.296
I masturbate every day in front of the webcam.
I bet they also know the brand of my vibrator.

45:07.596 --> 45:10.196
We know and ...
now you can stop.

45:22.432 --> 45:23.932
Sorry.

45:24.476 --> 45:25.476
What are you doing?

45:25.777 --> 45:26.977
I wipe my hands.

45:28.287 --> 45:29.287
I missed you.

45:30.803 --> 45:34.832
Can we be friends again?
Ava doesn't care.

45:35.106 --> 45:37.106
Yes sure.

45:37.848 --> 45:38.848
Well.

45:41.448 --> 45:44.448
I'll call you when I get back from Chicago.

46:24.160 --> 46:27.660
Sorry, I didn't think
they would have stayed so long.

46:28.139 --> 46:29.139
It does not matter.

46:39.391 --> 46:41.912
What's happening to you?

46:45.336 --> 46:46.836
I'm fine.

46:48.656 --> 46:51.156
I'm just tired.

46:52.771 --> 46:54.471
And for this?

46:57.159 --> 47:00.340
You seem so down lately.

47:02.000 --> 47:06.888
I was afraid I had done something.
You don't have to keep this job if it's not good for you.

47:07.622 --> 47:12.122
I'm fine.
I swear, I'm fine.

47:19.234 --> 47:21.579
Good answer...

47:21.921 --> 47:23.237
I mean...

47:24.145 --> 47:26.111
Fuck!

47:27.205 --> 47:29.205
Fuck, Colin!

47:30.147 --> 47:35.391
No need to talk about it, but sometimes it's difficult,
I'm not asking for much ...

47:35.504 --> 47:38.924
Just normal communication.
- Ava.

47:42.455 --> 47:45.455
I'm falling apart.

47:46.683 --> 47:48.683
I love you.

47:52.229 --> 47:53.729
I love you too.

49:38.315 --> 49:39.315
Girder.

49:41.163 --> 49:43.134
Girder please respond.

49:44.340 --> 49:46.997
- Vos, situation?
- Normal

49:47.860 --> 49:50.045
I'm taking control of the body.
What about Melis?

49:50.286 --> 49:54.276
The analysis is inconclusive,
very strange.

49:55.500 --> 49:57.388
Don't be so worried.

49:57.616 --> 50:02.352
I just wanted to check on the guest,
now I feel it ... perfectly.

50:05.022 --> 50:08.917
Also, Parse's dinner is tonight
and I'll be out in 24 hours.

50:09.183 --> 50:10.924
<i> Okay.</i>

50:11.622 --> 50:18.578
<i> I want you to recalibrate, adjust on:
131451280R</i>

51:17.016 --> 51:25.677
Walter Benjamin once wrote:
"Boredom is the bird that hatches the egg of experience"

51:25.809 --> 51:35.786
My dear friends and allies, I would like to start
the evening saying ... that you're bored.

51:36.584 --> 51:38.086
I'm bored...

51:38.938 --> 51:42.738
... because you are all so ... perfect.

51:43.081 --> 51:47.267
And our operation has become so ... perfect.

51:47.517 --> 51:52.694
And I found myself with nothing to do,
nothing to worry about.

51:53.213 --> 51:55.903
And in my boredom,

51:56.286 --> 52:05.337
I made a brood and from this comes the next
phase in the evolution of our work.

52:06.021 --> 52:06.902
To boredom!

52:07.315 --> 52:08.432
To boredom!

52:24.423 --> 52:28.149
- Are you ready?
- Sure, why shouldn't I?

52:28.228 --> 52:31.507
You know, I love my father,
but it is atrocious.

52:31.622 --> 52:37.263
- He's a great man.
- It is not. I don't even know if he's human.

52:37.649 --> 52:42.646
I think it's a huge pile of meat
that feeds on misery.

52:56.064 --> 52:57.468
Pope?

52:58.265 --> 53:01.245
Honey, what boy did you bring home.

53:01.449 --> 53:04.096
- Good evening, Mr. Parse.
- Yup...

53:05.496 --> 53:09.798
We were talking about psychology
of failure as a father.

53:09.888 --> 53:14.520
You start accepting it when you realize
that there is nothing you can do about it.

53:14.964 --> 53:17.367
Even Mr. Oiko has daughters.

53:17.622 --> 53:19.478
- Alex.
- Collin.

53:19.636 --> 53:21.594
Collin works for me now.

53:21.656 --> 53:28.155
Yes, I ... I got him a job that,
hopefully, it will not go beyond its capabilities.

53:28.209 --> 53:30.938
Are you doing well, Collin?

53:31.451 --> 53:34.333
- Everything good. Thanks.
- Very well.

53:34.482 --> 53:38.379
Let me know if it gets too difficult for you.

53:50.071 --> 53:52.306
I need a drink.

53:53.240 --> 53:55.308
Wait here.
I will be right back.

54:47.317 --> 54:49.658
- I'm on the spot.
- Well.

54:51.386 --> 54:53.655
I want it to start tonight
a quarrel with Parse.

54:54.417 --> 54:58.396
Get thrown out of the party.
Something blatant.

54:58.839 --> 55:03.646
And later you come back, and let's finish the job.
All clear?

55:31.026 --> 55:32.799
- Are you OK?
- Oh sorry...

55:36.008 --> 55:39.150
- Want another drink?
- No, that's okay.

56:26.943 --> 56:28.690
Can I help you?

56:28.925 --> 56:32.371
I have a feeling you owe me an apology.

56:32.601 --> 56:34.342
Ah! And why?

56:34.777 --> 56:36.426
I have a hunch.

56:39.367 --> 56:43.587
Folks, my future son-in-law.

56:45.515 --> 56:51.023
We're having a conversation, Collin, then
why don't you go fuck yourself in a corner?

56:51.076 --> 56:52.916
Do it for me.352

56:54.767 --> 56:58.699
I will only go away when Ava
he will have sucked my cock properly.

57:06.875 --> 57:07.790
That's enough....

57:12.564 --> 57:14.858
Do you think you can step on me?

57:15.026 --> 57:16.961
I am a giant!

57:17.014 --> 57:19.302
I'm a fucking giant!

57:19.471 --> 57:23.461
- Get him out of here.
- Fuck you, bitch!

59:11.983 --> 59:12.841
Shit.

59:15.306 --> 59:19.844
- I don't think I can go home tonight.
- Stay here.

59:20.964 --> 59:24.166
Your room is just waiting for you.

59:25.408 --> 59:30.318
Yes but I don't think it helps.
Such a cold bed ...

59:30.552 --> 59:33.427
Unbearable.

59:36.481 --> 59:38.159
I go to bed.

59:40.262 --> 59:44.148
Why don't you fuck your mother in Dubai.

59:44.287 --> 59:46.565
"Dubai and goodbye".

01:00:13.201 --> 01:00:15.470
What are you doing here?

01:00:22.431 --> 01:00:23.128
This is...

01:00:24.746 --> 01:00:25.919
Get out.

01:00:26.464 --> 01:00:28.645
Get out before I call the police.

01:00:31.201 --> 01:00:32.898
Why don't you throw me out?

01:00:38.426 --> 01:00:39.603
I'm drunk.

01:00:44.521 --> 01:00:47.076
I go to bed.

01:03:53.144 --> 01:03:55.382
Get me out.

01:04:06.148 --> 01:04:07.271
Fuck!

01:04:08.448 --> 01:04:09.171
Fuck!

01:04:10.448 --> 01:04:11.271
Fuck!

01:04:27.448 --> 01:04:28.971
Get me out!

01:04:29.894 --> 01:04:30.583
Get me out!

01:05:26.448 --> 01:05:27.968
What happened?

01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:29.339
It is emerging.

01:05:29.365 --> 01:05:30.396
No.

01:05:41.945 --> 01:05:46.032
There is physical damage to the implant.

01:05:58.699 --> 01:05:59.822
Fuck!

01:07:05.971 --> 01:07:08.634
Your agent is stable, but not responding.

01:07:08.761 --> 01:07:12.357
It seems that it has not been able
to maintain control over the guest.

01:07:12.802 --> 01:07:13.548
What about Tate?

01:07:14.122 --> 01:07:15.545
Hard to say.

01:07:15.850 --> 01:07:19.673
Now we are tracking him as the dominant body.
But I see how to get out of the situation.

01:07:19.842 --> 01:07:24.199
See if he can find his way
of the return and to finish the job.

01:07:24.259 --> 01:07:27.042
There is already some degree of permanent damage.

01:07:27.276 --> 01:07:31.454
The longer it stays, the greater the risk to your brain.

01:07:31.481 --> 01:07:32.772
She stays inside.

01:08:34.966 --> 01:08:38.005
Mr. Tate,
Is it there?

01:08:38.075 --> 01:08:41.011
We should say two words.

01:09:14.852 --> 01:09:16.290
Yup?

01:09:19.653 --> 01:09:22.013
Hey, what are you doing here?

01:09:22.112 --> 01:09:24.810
Sorry, damn it ...

01:09:25.247 --> 01:09:28.506
I did it, so you know, we can be together.

01:09:28.712 --> 01:09:32.308
Thing? What have you done?

01:09:32.902 --> 01:09:36.339
I was ... I was angry.

01:09:37.796 --> 01:09:45.091
- They attacked me, I was just defending myself.
- What you say makes no sense, Colin.

01:09:45.493 --> 01:09:47.207
I'm staying with Michael.

01:09:47.902 --> 01:09:49.010
Who is Michael?

01:09:52.350 --> 01:09:56.172
Fuck, you're bleeding.

01:09:56.493 --> 01:09:58.457
Sit down, come on.

01:09:58.902 --> 01:10:00.076
Sit down.

01:10:06.095 --> 01:10:09.029
Oh yes, I stumbled upon coming here.408

01:10:09.502 --> 01:10:10.557
I banged my head.

01:10:11.122 --> 01:10:16.260
Yes, well, you'll have to go to the hospital, because
you probably have a concussion.

01:10:17.082 --> 01:10:19.633
No, I'm fine.

01:10:20.855 --> 01:10:24.640
- Sorry if I scared you.
- Scared?

01:10:26.957 --> 01:10:28.012
Here.

01:10:29.070 --> 01:10:32.813
Do you want some water, or gin?

01:10:33.028 --> 01:10:35.681
Water and gin, that's all I have.

01:10:35.690 --> 01:10:37.748
I was getting ready to go to the airport.

01:10:39.881 --> 01:10:42.815
- Chicago?
- Hm, hmm.

01:10:43.311 --> 01:10:45.612
We should meet when I get back.

01:10:46.788 --> 01:10:49.301
Ava and I fought.

01:10:49.774 --> 01:10:51.534
Can i stay here?

01:10:52.318 --> 01:10:53.893
I can't go home.

01:10:56.256 --> 01:10:57.311
Poor little one!

01:11:13.026 --> 01:11:14.315
Okay, two nights.

01:11:16.198 --> 01:11:18.264
Leave the key on the desk when you go out.

01:11:20.328 --> 01:11:21.553
I am going to take a shower.

01:11:21.858 --> 01:11:22.683
Thanks.

01:11:41.366 --> 01:11:42.091
Treasure.

01:11:44.596 --> 01:11:45.321
Treasure.

01:11:49.877 --> 01:11:51.138
Of course honey.

01:11:56.596 --> 01:11:57.613
I'm hungry.

01:12:01.305 --> 01:12:02.523
Definitely hungry.

01:13:06.596 --> 01:13:07.321
Colin?

01:13:36.055 --> 01:13:40.831
<i> Now let's get to the news of the conditions
by Johnathan Parse, who is stable, but ...</i>

01:13:40.831 --> 01:13:47.982
<i> it is not yet confirmed what it has
left with significant brain injury ...</i>

01:13:47.982 --> 01:13:52.475
<i> in a shocking attack that left Mr. Parse. </i>
in critical condition and killed his daughter.

01:13:52.475 --> 01:13:54.967
<i> The paramedics arrived just in time ... </i>

01:14:03.002 --> 01:14:04.760
Who is it?

01:14:05.798 --> 01:14:06.911
Who is it?

01:14:06.948 --> 01:14:09.571
Tate? Tate?

01:14:10.133 --> 01:14:11.357
Eddie?

01:14:11.591 --> 01:14:13.051
Come on let me in.

01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:23.405
Hey, look ...

01:14:23.636 --> 01:14:26.979
Poor guy ...
- What are you doing here?

01:14:27.055 --> 01:14:29.887
I heard you had an accident
and I came to see how you are.

01:14:30.357 --> 01:14:32.712
- How did you know I was here?
- Reeta called me.

01:14:33.212 --> 01:14:36.704
- Do you know Reeta?
- Sure. Hey, give me a drink.

01:14:38.259 --> 01:14:39.464
Yup.

01:15:56.901 --> 01:16:01.822
Vos, Vos. Hey, let's go back.

01:16:01.966 --> 01:16:10.921
I have suppressed the guest and we will have control for a while, but
we have to move fast before the effect wears off.

01:16:13.166 --> 01:16:24.992
Hey, hey! Calm down, Girder sent me!

01:16:26.083 --> 01:16:28.514
- Girder?
- I was undercover.

01:16:28.919 --> 01:16:35.484
Did not you know? I'm a collaborator,
I was part of the deal. Here we go.

01:16:44.568 --> 01:16:53.032
Here it is. I've heard a lot about you.
The great Tasya Vos is an honor.

01:16:53.204 --> 01:16:57.543
- I was a big fan of stabbing
by Elliot Matza. - Eddie?

01:17:02.915 --> 01:17:08.964
- Ahead. I can't pull the trigger.
- Oh, no, no. I am a Christian.

01:17:09.096 --> 01:17:12.835
And then Girder said you have to be
 you kill Colin.

01:17:12.969 --> 01:17:18.467
A public thing, no questions.
I'm here to take care of your head.

01:17:20.461 --> 01:17:22.808
I don't have complete control at the moment.

01:17:23.264 --> 01:17:28.695
That's why I'm here.
Come on, we don't have much time.

01:17:42.127 --> 01:17:45.195
Ok. Here we go.

01:17:45.901 --> 01:17:48.867
Let's check the sync first.

01:17:48.900 --> 01:17:52.756
You will see a series of images.

01:17:52.935 --> 01:17:55.942
Look at them and answer my questions.

01:17:56.119 --> 01:17:59.849
- Do you see a fox or a bird?
- Fox.

01:18:01.460 --> 01:18:04.281
- A fish or a snake?
- A fish.

01:18:05.841 --> 01:18:09.393
- Mouse or dog?
- Mouse.

01:18:09.889 --> 01:18:15.080
Well. See the right animals,
as they say.

01:18:15.327 --> 01:18:19.497
Now I will do a pulse analysis.

01:18:19.717 --> 01:18:23.410
You may feel a little uncomfortable, but
you have to keep breathing normally.

01:18:23.727 --> 01:18:25.333
Ready?

01:21:10.895 --> 01:21:12.974
Eddie?

01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:15.594
Eddie?

01:21:17.532 --> 01:21:18.266
Eddie?

01:21:19.488 --> 01:21:20.834
Fuck.

01:21:23.886 --> 01:21:26.391
Ah, shit.
No...

01:22:28.425 --> 01:22:30.589
Whore.

01:22:35.565 --> 01:22:41.776
You want to shoot.
Just do it.

01:22:43.578 --> 01:22:45.578
Just do it! Just do it!

01:23:32.478 --> 01:23:38.387
Hi honey.

01:23:41.238 --> 01:23:43.238
Treasure.

01:23:51.522 --> 01:23:53.954
Hi honey ...

01:23:56.809 --> 01:23:58.809
Treasure.

01:24:00.893 --> 01:24:02.893
Hi, honey.

01:24:37.310 --> 01:24:39.281
Ah, Michael.

01:24:41.331 --> 01:24:43.999
I'm starving...

01:24:48.175 --> 01:24:50.175
I'm starving...

01:25:25.658 --> 01:25:27.650
Hi.

01:25:29.382 --> 01:25:31.761
What do you have there?
- A map.

01:25:33.238 --> 01:25:38.578
- A map of what?
- Take me to a place I discovered yesterday.

01:25:41.902 --> 01:25:45.106
- What's your name?
- Wrath.

01:25:45.657 --> 01:25:46.832
Anger.

01:25:48.572 --> 01:25:52.419
I think I met you somewhere.

01:25:56.303 --> 01:25:59.353
Is that your house?

01:26:00.710 --> 01:26:02.621
Anger!

01:26:09.567 --> 01:26:11.305
Yup.

01:26:54.753 --> 01:26:58.523
- Michael?
- Yup?

01:26:58.875 --> 01:27:05.805
I am a friend of your wife.
I'm a friend of Tas.

01:27:07.729 --> 01:27:09.941
- Im very sorry...
- Hi.

01:27:10.255 --> 01:27:14.088
- Tas no longer lives here
- I do not know...

01:27:14.303 --> 01:27:19.434
- He wanted me to tell you something, I can ...
- Maybe later, it's late ...

01:27:20.639 --> 01:27:22.768
Where is it?
Where's your wife?

01:27:22.994 --> 01:27:26.126
Where is it? -I swear, I don't know! -
Sit down, put your hands on the table.

01:27:26.277 --> 01:27:30.268
- Hands on the table! - Work, I don't even know
if he is still in the Company.

01:27:30.374 --> 01:27:33.427
You know me?
You know me?

01:27:33.765 --> 01:27:38.546
I need to know what he did to me, understand?

01:27:38.671 --> 01:27:44.132
I'm sorry. Tell me what it is
and maybe I can help you.

01:27:45.534 --> 01:27:51.400
Have you ever thought of your wife as a predator?
Have you ever seen it that way? - I do not know...

01:27:51.514 --> 01:27:54.528
Do not look at me.
Keep your head down.

01:27:54.755 --> 01:28:01.474
- Have you ever thought about parasites,
with cats? - Thing?

01:28:01.641 --> 01:28:03.641
Think about it.

01:28:03.987 --> 01:28:13.169
One day your wife is cleaning the cat litter
and a worm enters it. And this worm ends up in his brain.

01:28:13.374 --> 01:28:18.736
And then he ends up having access
to his ideas.

01:28:19.998 --> 01:28:24.853
And then you don't know if the ideas
they are yours or the worm.

01:28:25.015 --> 01:28:33.808
And it makes you do things. Terrible things. And then you start
to understand that he is no longer the same person.

01:28:33.995 --> 01:28:37.474
He is no longer the person he was.

01:28:37.807 --> 01:28:49.062
Start by asking yourself if you married her or the worm.

01:28:52.376 --> 01:28:57.060
See, damn bitch?
I'm doing.

01:28:57.679 --> 01:28:59.891
Come out or do it!

01:29:13.798 --> 01:29:21.635
- What do you do here?
- Tas. I was looking for you.

01:29:21.839 --> 01:29:27.282
- I wanted to talk.
- Why?

01:29:27.961 --> 01:29:33.061
- What you did to me?
- Done?

01:29:34.455 --> 01:29:39.760
- You're in control.
- No.

01:29:40.667 --> 01:29:44.770
I have never been in control of myself.

01:29:45.178 --> 01:29:49.016
Now you have it.
Where's Ava?

01:29:55.479 --> 01:30:01.621
Where's your loved one?
Do you remember?

01:30:03.308 --> 01:30:08.666
- No, it wasn't me.
- Yes, it is.

01:30:13.642 --> 01:30:20.895
Poor Michael.
I loved it.527

01:30:25.639 --> 01:30:28.104
But I'm not sure it was me.

01:30:32.955 --> 01:30:40.620
I will kill him. Fix it all
or I swear I'll kill him.

01:30:41.966 --> 01:30:48.181
Forward. Just do it.
You will get it all back.

01:30:54.363 --> 01:30:57.185
It's what you've always wanted.

01:32:13.294 --> 01:32:15.025
Get me out.

01:33:48.182 --> 01:33:51.215
Get me out.

01:35:19.429 --> 01:35:23.046
- You need to take a break.
- No, let's finish.

01:35:23.557 --> 01:35:25.362
Ok.

01:35:27.641 --> 01:35:36.980
This is my grandfather's pipe.
He died before I was born. My father gave it to me.

01:35:36.980 --> 01:35:41.648
Well. Next one.

01:35:50.986 --> 01:36:00.265
This is also mine. I killed her and kept her
when I was a girl.

01:36:02.685 --> 01:36:04.927
Very well.
