Thomas was getting an earful

00:13.333 --> 00:16.000
about Saint's upcoming
second birthday party.

00:16.033 --> 00:19.367

00:56.767 --> 00:59.066

Perhaps.

03:23.400 --> 03:25.033
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

- The only reason people

03:26.333 --> 03:28.000
warned me about dating Thomas

03:28.033 --> 03:29.667
was that you're a part

04:17.500 --> 04:19.367
I think that would be
disrespectful.

want her being disrespectful

I was not allowed to be there.

How about you walk away

05:28.100 --> 05:30.033

05:39.600 --> 05:41.033
- Thomas, you should
get her out of her.

05:41.066 --> 05:42.667
- Did you visit your son
in the hospital?

05:42.700 --> 05:45.266
No.
- She's taken a lot of shots.

05:45.300 --> 05:48.300
- Let me talk to you a second.
Let me talk to you a second.

05:48.300 --> 05:50.166

- Well, I'm not responding...
away.

05:52.166 --> 05:55.533

totally incorrect information.

I want to go.

05:56.667 --> 05:58.700

right there.

07:18.500 --> 07:20.233

You have no say so.

07:35.233 --> 07:36.433

Oh, you're only going to

- My girlfriend might get mad.

19:22.500 --> 19:25.300
- I'm going to bed.
- Good night.

19:25.300 --> 19:28.033
- All right, breakfast
is at 9:30, Chels.

19:28.033 --> 19:31.433
- Yeah, right, after your
two mile run down the beach?

19:31.433 --> 19:33.567
- My entire life savings
says that you won't.

19:33.567 --> 19:36.033
- No sh--, Naomie, that's why
I wasn't talking to you.

19:36.033 --> 19:37.433
I was talking to Chelsea,
but you're more than welcome

19:37.433 --> 19:40.133
to enjoy it in the morning.
- Jesus Christ.

19:40.133 --> 19:42.166
- I don't need to hear
any more of your negativity.

19:42.166 --> 19:43.533
It's exhausting.

19:45.400 --> 19:47.667
- Whatever.
- All right, sh--.

19:49.600 --> 19:51.300
- Tomás.

19:51.300 --> 19:53.567
- She does not think
I'm an enabler, does she?

19:57.033 --> 20:00.166
"Enabler."

20:00.166 --> 20:03.033
Is she outside?

20:03.066 --> 20:05.000
- Hey.
- Okay, do you--

20:05.033 --> 20:06.734
I'll talk to you--
talk to you when you're inside.

20:06.734 --> 20:08.500
- I'll be back in a second.

20:12.233 --> 20:14.133
- You didn't hear
half of the conversation.

20:14.166 --> 20:16.700
Kathryn wasn't saying anything.
- I wanted to respect her,

20:16.734 --> 20:19.066
and let her finish,
and not interrupt.

20:19.066 --> 20:20.734
- Oh, my God, dude.
- The sh-- that she says.

20:20.734 --> 20:23.066
- She was talking about
our children.

20:23.100 --> 20:25.600
Like, stuff
that's not even true.

20:25.633 --> 20:28.700
Like, Lord have mercy,
that was so just

20:28.734 --> 20:31.000
inappropriate in every way.

20:33.367 --> 20:35.734
What are they talking--
Who is she talking to now?

20:35.767 --> 20:38.200
- You know what, Chelsea,
I've tried.

20:38.233 --> 20:39.600
- Oh, God.

20:39.633 --> 20:41.467
- So you think
being that evil to her

20:41.467 --> 20:43.266
is going to make it better?
- No.

20:43.300 --> 20:45.400
But I don't want to be taken
advantage of my kindness

20:45.433 --> 20:47.266
or my niceness.
You're right, I stooped.

20:47.300 --> 20:48.600
But you think she really
wants to get to know me?

20:48.633 --> 20:51.166
- Yeah, I do.
- Oh, my gosh.

20:51.200 --> 20:52.467
She needs to go to sleep.

20:52.500 --> 20:55.300
- Why doesn't she
be nice to me, then?

20:55.333 --> 20:57.600
you just said to her tonight.

20:57.633 --> 21:00.467
- Oh, but this was building up.

21:00.500 --> 21:02.467
You think this
just happened tonight?

21:02.500 --> 21:06.033
- It doesn't--
the evil that I saw,

21:06.066 --> 21:08.233
I don't know how you ever
turn back from that,

21:08.266 --> 21:10.633
and that's what sad,
is because we all were like,

21:10.633 --> 21:12.700
this is good, they're going to
have a good relationship.

21:12.734 --> 21:14.700
They're going to get along,
they're going to be able to

21:14.734 --> 21:17.767
do this co-parenting thing.
- Yeah, right.

21:17.767 --> 21:19.767
I don't want to
hang out with her.

21:19.767 --> 21:22.767
She's--you don't even know.
She's crazy.

21:22.767 --> 21:24.767
But I'm doing it for the sake
of the freaking children.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.633
Chelsea, I'm not
going anywhere, Chelsea.

21:26.633 --> 21:29.533
- I know, but I think--
- Chelsea, everyone moves on.

21:29.567 --> 21:31.367
- Those children,
that's their mother,

21:31.400 --> 21:33.734
and you said some evil sh--
about--about their mother.

21:33.767 --> 21:36.367
- Just because you give birth
to something, Chelsea,

21:36.400 --> 21:38.000
doesn't mean you're a mother.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.767
I know a lot of
adoptive parents, Chelsea.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.467
You know what?
God gave us all free will.

21:44.500 --> 21:46.000
- Okay.
- She chose this.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.400
- Okay. Okay.
- She chose this path.

21:47.433 --> 21:50.500
It's time to take some
accountability, Chelsea.

21:50.533 --> 21:52.000
Accountability.
- Please stop talking

21:52.000 --> 21:53.266
to me like that.

21:53.266 --> 21:54.734
Please stop talking
to me like that.

21:54.767 --> 21:57.000
It's so annoying.
I'm just trying to go to bed.

21:57.033 --> 22:00.133
Like, I don't need "Chelsea."
Goddamn.

22:00.133 --> 22:03.767
- Accountability,
responsibility.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
- She just owes Kathryn
an apology.

22:06.000 --> 22:11.033
- No, she owes me going away
and never returning, I swear.

22:11.033 --> 22:13.533
- That's a different situation.
- No, no.

22:13.567 --> 22:15.533
It will be a legal situation.
- She owes you an apology.

22:15.567 --> 22:17.500
- These are my children.

22:17.533 --> 22:19.500
This is my life.

22:21.700 --> 22:25.100
- Well, you know, it's just--
- I mean, my God.

22:25.133 --> 22:27.300

real, real protective,

22:27.300 --> 22:29.667

22:29.700 --> 22:31.700
She's been here, what,
two, three months?

22:31.700 --> 22:33.367

I think that makes it--

22:33.400 --> 22:35.166
I don't know,
I don't want to sound racist,

22:35.166 --> 22:37.166
