WEBVTT

00:01.894 --> 00:03.192
I'm going with Germany.

00:03.193 --> 00:04.812
It's not the World Cup.
You can't pick Germany.

00:04.813 --> 00:07.646
- For the surprise factor.
- Surprising what a bad choice it is?

00:07.745 --> 00:09.778
The first official trip
of the Secretary of State

00:09.779 --> 00:11.477
is loaded with political content.

00:11.478 --> 00:12.911
The world doesn't know her yet.

00:12.912 --> 00:15.244
This decision speaks to who
she is, what she stands for.

00:15.245 --> 00:16.311
Exactly.

00:16.312 --> 00:17.778
And if she chooses
Germany, it looks like

00:17.779 --> 00:19.978
she stands for techno and schnitzel.

00:19.979 --> 00:21.210
Right. She's fun.

00:21.211 --> 00:23.110
Okay, the secretary is not... "fun."

00:23.111 --> 00:25.344
Turkey is looking like the front-runner.

00:25.345 --> 00:26.744
- (groans) Turkey?
- Turkey's actually...

00:26.745 --> 00:28.344
It's neither here nor there.

00:28.345 --> 00:30.210
It's not fully Europe, not really Asia.

00:30.211 --> 00:32.578
It's the tofurkey of the Western world.

00:32.579 --> 00:34.411
Which is ironic, given that it's Turkey.

00:34.412 --> 00:37.377
Well, my money's on Egypt.
It's edgy, it's progressive.

00:37.378 --> 00:40.311
It's the gateway for modern
Middle Eastern diplomacy.

00:40.312 --> 00:41.644
I beg you...

00:41.645 --> 00:43.811
- let me do the writing.
- You know, I nominated Brazil.

00:43.812 --> 00:45.411
Seventh largest economy.

00:45.412 --> 00:46.878
They just won the Olympic bid.

00:46.879 --> 00:49.224
- Not to mention they...
- Not to mention their first-class beaches.

00:49.225 --> 00:50.144
(both laugh)

00:50.145 --> 00:51.511
Why do you even care about beaches?

00:51.512 --> 00:52.644
You're ditching us for Nantucket.

00:52.645 --> 00:53.744
It's a family wedding.

00:53.745 --> 00:54.945
Boyfriend's family wedding.

00:54.946 --> 00:56.644
Which is at least one step removed.

00:56.645 --> 00:58.377
Bridesmaid, which makes it
a family obligation.

00:58.378 --> 00:59.778
Boyfriend's family obligation.

00:59.779 --> 01:01.477
Would you two like to be alone?

01:01.478 --> 01:02.911
No. Why would we?

01:02.912 --> 01:04.411
It's a healthy professional debate.

01:04.412 --> 01:06.344
Oh, good.

01:06.345 --> 01:09.110
Okay. I've read your proposals.

01:09.111 --> 01:12.077
I was up all night making
a pro and con spreadsheet.

01:12.078 --> 01:14.477
And I nearly flipped a coin.
Drum-roll, anyone?

01:14.478 --> 01:17.211
(electronic drum-roll playing)

01:17.912 --> 01:19.978
(drum-roll stops)

01:19.979 --> 01:22.011
We're going to Turkey.

01:22.012 --> 01:24.344
- (groans)
- Excellent choice, Madam Secretary.

01:24.345 --> 01:26.444
BLAKE: I won the bet, guys.

01:26.445 --> 01:28.244
Turkey... Pay up, now.

01:28.245 --> 01:30.778
Thank you. Thank you.

01:30.779 --> 01:33.144
Thank you.

01:33.145 --> 01:35.045
- That was outrageous.
- I know.

01:35.046 --> 01:36.644
Can you believe what
a suck-up Scott is?

01:36.645 --> 01:38.176
I mean, he's a junior speechwriter.

01:38.177 --> 01:39.579
He should be read and not heard.

01:39.580 --> 01:40.778
I'm talking about you.

01:40.779 --> 01:43.077
Sparring with me like that
in front of the staff.

01:43.078 --> 01:44.377
You sparred back.

01:44.378 --> 01:46.045
Things with Win are serious!

01:46.046 --> 01:47.144
I'm in his sister's wedding!

01:47.145 --> 01:49.110
That changes the whole dynamic.

01:49.111 --> 01:51.344
And no one can ever
know about our past

01:51.345 --> 01:52.911
- or it would ruin my life.
- By our past,

01:52.912 --> 01:54.778
are you referring to last week?

01:54.779 --> 01:55.844
It's over.

01:55.845 --> 01:57.311
It never happened.

01:57.312 --> 01:58.477
If you care about me at all,

01:58.478 --> 02:00.278
you'll get with the program.

02:03.645 --> 02:07.144
It's a replica of the set
that Lady Bird Johnson

02:07.145 --> 02:09.210
had commissioned for the White House.

02:09.211 --> 02:10.744
It's the perfect gift.

02:10.745 --> 02:12.911
President Kozlu loves his tea.

02:12.912 --> 02:14.277
As much as he loves

02:14.278 --> 02:16.177
- Michael Jordan?
- Well...

02:16.178 --> 02:17.911
Madam Secretary, your lunch date.

02:17.912 --> 02:19.878
Ooh! Quick, quick, quick... what says,

02:19.879 --> 02:21.644
"Let's make world peace"?

02:21.645 --> 02:25.277
Tiffany tea set or signed
Jordan basketball?

02:25.278 --> 02:28.110
Do you want to impress the
Turkish president or play house?

02:28.111 --> 02:30.311
Basketball it is.

02:30.312 --> 02:31.778
- Very good.
- Thanks.

02:31.779 --> 02:32.844
(laughs)

02:32.845 --> 02:34.911
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:34.912 --> 02:37.210
Mm.

02:37.211 --> 02:38.744
Just think... in two weeks,

02:38.745 --> 02:41.578
we can be doing this
at the Hagia Sophia.

02:41.579 --> 02:43.144
Unless, of course, it's illegal

02:43.145 --> 02:45.014
to make out in a former
mosque, in which...

02:45.015 --> 02:45.912
Oh, yeah, About that.

02:45.913 --> 02:48.204
- Oh, no. What?
- My publisher called. They're moving up

02:48.205 --> 02:49.608
- the release date on my book.
- You can't come.

02:49.609 --> 02:50.844
If I'm gonna meet this new deadline,

02:50.845 --> 02:52.763
- I've got to stay and write.
- The whole point

02:52.764 --> 02:54.644
of this first big trip
was that it was gonna

02:54.645 --> 02:57.045
be a family educational vacation.

02:57.046 --> 02:58.644
- And everybody's going.
- Not Stevie!

02:58.645 --> 03:00.878
- Well, Stevie has to work.
- Well, I have to work.

03:00.879 --> 03:02.511
You can't write on the trip?

03:02.512 --> 03:04.511
- You can write on the...
- I'm sorry, I got to stay.

03:04.512 --> 03:06.277
NADINE: Ma'am, the White House called.

03:06.278 --> 03:08.544
You've been summoned to Camp David.

03:08.545 --> 03:10.077
Motorcade's waiting outside.

03:10.078 --> 03:11.811
Oh, fine.

03:11.812 --> 03:14.110
The leader of the free
world trumps lunch?

03:14.111 --> 03:15.945
Sorry. (laughs)

03:15.946 --> 03:17.844
It's okay. You go to work.

03:17.845 --> 03:19.477
I see what you did there.

03:19.478 --> 03:21.445
I did.

03:23.012 --> 03:24.812
Hey. So, uh, what did she pick?

03:24.813 --> 03:27.181
I'm drafting remarks for the gift exchange.

03:27.182 --> 03:29.235
Well, there's a problem. I've just come

03:29.236 --> 03:31.244
from the diplomatic passport office,

03:31.245 --> 03:33.377
and your paperwork's been held back.

03:33.378 --> 03:34.237
What?

03:34.238 --> 03:35.778
Something about a bench warrant

03:35.779 --> 03:37.978
from a speeding ticket
outside of Las Vegas.

03:37.979 --> 03:39.511
Oh, I took care of that.

03:39.512 --> 03:40.945
It was a misunderstanding.

03:40.946 --> 03:42.878
It was Jay's bachelor party.
I wasn't even driving...

03:42.879 --> 03:45.444
Please stop talking before I
hear something I can't forget.

03:45.445 --> 03:48.544
The point is your passport
won't be ready in time.

03:48.545 --> 03:50.478
So... you won't be going to Turkey.

03:50.479 --> 03:51.527
Wait.

03:51.528 --> 03:52.979
It's the diplomatic passport office.

03:52.980 --> 03:54.878
I mean, doesn't the Secretary of State,

03:54.879 --> 03:56.678
- like, own them?
- Don't worry.

03:56.679 --> 03:57.744
She'll be in good hands.

03:57.745 --> 03:59.077
Scott's gonna cover for you.

03:59.078 --> 04:00.711
Scott? The new kid?

04:00.712 --> 04:02.077
But-but he's my deputy.

04:02.078 --> 04:03.644
And he's a kid.

04:03.645 --> 04:05.344
Nothing to be done.

04:05.345 --> 04:08.245
Turkey will miss you.

04:11.046 --> 04:13.679
(two gunshots)

04:16.144 --> 04:18.345
Pull!

04:20.712 --> 04:22.623
Whoa!

04:22.624 --> 04:24.876
If only you'd be that quick
on the draw for tax cuts.

04:24.877 --> 04:26.712
Pull!

04:30.478 --> 04:33.045
Elizabeth.

04:33.046 --> 04:34.140
Glad you could make it.

04:34.141 --> 04:36.046
You know my friend Ted Graham.

04:36.047 --> 04:37.711
Oh, don't put her on the spot.

04:37.712 --> 04:38.811
Why would she remember?

04:38.812 --> 04:40.244
We met briefly at the inauguration.

04:40.245 --> 04:41.344
I do remember.

04:41.345 --> 04:42.945
You had the expensive seats.

04:42.946 --> 04:43.945
(chuckles)

04:43.946 --> 04:45.277
I'll get right to it, Bess.

04:45.278 --> 04:47.377
I know I signed off on
Turkey for your first trip,

04:47.378 --> 04:50.811
but, uh, tell me, did
you consider India?

04:50.812 --> 04:52.612
Yes. It was a strong candidate.

04:52.613 --> 04:54.110
But?

04:54.111 --> 04:56.878
But I decided to give

04:56.879 --> 04:58.978
Prime Minister Saigal
more time in office.

04:58.979 --> 05:01.144
See if he's still barking
anti-Americanisms

05:01.145 --> 05:03.678
when he's not running as
India's great nationalist hope.

05:03.679 --> 05:05.878
Yeah, but you see,
that's the reason to go.

05:05.879 --> 05:07.511
If you get in early,

05:07.512 --> 05:09.110
you establish a rapport.

05:09.111 --> 05:11.244
Ted here is, uh, an early adopter

05:11.245 --> 05:12.778
when it comes to India.

05:12.779 --> 05:14.678
Well, my company Hepanza
Chemical has a couple

05:14.679 --> 05:17.911
of garment dye factories
in Uttar Pradesh.

05:17.912 --> 05:21.210
So, you must be thrilled by
Prime Minister Saigal's vow

05:21.211 --> 05:23.498
to ramp up India's native manufacturing.

05:23.499 --> 05:24.864
DALTON: Ventures like Hepanza

05:24.865 --> 05:26.845
are crucial to U.S.
economic stake in India.

05:26.846 --> 05:28.045
Right now, they're under fire.

05:28.046 --> 05:29.277
That's where you come in.

05:29.278 --> 05:31.045
TED: Because a visit
from you, especially

05:31.046 --> 05:32.579
on your maiden diplomatic voyage,

05:32.580 --> 05:35.177
emphasizing a balanced
and a fair partnership...

05:35.178 --> 05:37.477
Well, it'd go a long
way to reassure Saigal

05:37.478 --> 05:39.144
that the U.S. is a friend to work with,

05:39.145 --> 05:41.411
not some big brother to outdo.

05:41.412 --> 05:43.244
Of course, it's up to you.

05:43.245 --> 05:45.512
Of course, sir.

05:51.946 --> 05:53.844
Orange blouse...

05:53.845 --> 05:55.778
yea or nay?

05:55.779 --> 05:58.110
Well, in India,

05:58.111 --> 06:00.544
saffron is an auspicious color.

06:00.545 --> 06:02.744
At least according to Daisy's

06:02.745 --> 06:04.744
cultural color protocol

06:04.745 --> 06:06.244
psychology packet.

06:06.245 --> 06:07.277
Still unclear.

06:07.278 --> 06:08.311
Yea.

06:08.312 --> 06:09.911
I could use some auspiciousness.

06:09.912 --> 06:11.304
How do you feel about the president

06:11.305 --> 06:13.444
- rerouting your trip?
- I serve at the pleasure.

06:13.445 --> 06:15.377
I've chosen to feel fine about it.

06:15.378 --> 06:17.715
We're going to the Taj Mahal,
right? I assumed yes,

06:17.716 --> 06:18.588
but you never said, so...

06:18.589 --> 06:20.045
- We're going to the Taj Mahal.
- Oh!

06:20.046 --> 06:22.011
Yes! This makes the whole disruption

06:22.012 --> 06:23.545
of my former life worth it.

06:23.546 --> 06:25.224
Glad I finally came through.

06:25.225 --> 06:26.912
What about you, buddy?
Have you packed yet?

06:26.913 --> 06:29.045
Uh, I have an extra battery

06:29.046 --> 06:30.878
- if that's what you mean.
- That's good.

06:30.879 --> 06:32.210
Yeah, that way this whole

06:32.211 --> 06:35.011
cultural experience won't
be lost on you. He's...

06:35.012 --> 06:36.811
Please come, Henry.

06:36.812 --> 06:38.878
You can write in my office.

06:38.879 --> 06:40.711
On my plane.

06:40.712 --> 06:42.411
Did I mention that I have an office?

06:42.412 --> 06:43.711
On my plane?

06:43.712 --> 06:46.178
Believe me, if I thought
I could spare one minute

06:46.179 --> 06:48.177
away from the archives,
I would so come.

06:48.178 --> 06:49.411
But I'm gonna be researching 24-7,

06:49.412 --> 06:50.611
I'll be surrounded by

06:50.612 --> 06:52.177
these smelly parchments, (laughs)

06:52.178 --> 06:54.578
imitating the monks I'm writing about.

06:54.579 --> 06:56.411
Don't worry. I'll make
sure he's groomed

06:56.412 --> 06:57.678
by the time you get back.

06:57.679 --> 06:59.678
Does this make my
complexion look weird?

06:59.679 --> 07:00.744
Yeah.

07:00.745 --> 07:02.011
Like you have liver disease.

07:02.012 --> 07:03.744
Trust your own color wheel.

07:03.745 --> 07:07.011
That's true. It's gotten me this far.

07:07.012 --> 07:08.945
Declan? Hi!

07:08.946 --> 07:10.444
Can you cover for me?

07:10.445 --> 07:12.110
I overslept. I know.

07:12.111 --> 07:14.611
I was hanging out really late
last night with my mom.

07:14.612 --> 07:17.277
Uh, because she, she left
for India this morning.

07:17.278 --> 07:20.244
Um, yeah, because
she travels for a living.

07:20.245 --> 07:22.077
Can we just do the back-story later?

07:22.078 --> 07:24.011
Can you just tell the manager
I'm in the bathroom?

07:24.012 --> 07:26.945
Okay, I-I'm almost there.

07:28.000 --> 07:34.074

07:36.979 --> 07:39.412
(laughs)

07:41.812 --> 07:44.112
(phone dings)

07:51.178 --> 07:54.178
Excuse me. That's my daughter.

07:55.412 --> 07:56.879
Hey!

08:02.211 --> 08:04.711
Hey! Where you going?

08:04.712 --> 08:06.112
Stevie, stop!

08:08.712 --> 08:10.077
Hey. I didn't expect

08:10.078 --> 08:11.578
to see you just then.
I thought you'd be at work.

08:11.579 --> 08:13.811
Yeah, I could say the same for you.

08:13.812 --> 08:15.411
Who's that woman?

08:15.412 --> 08:16.644
(laughs)

08:16.645 --> 08:19.477
She's a former grad student of mine.

08:19.478 --> 08:21.244
I needed some help with the chapter

08:21.245 --> 08:23.277
I'm doing on cenobitic
tradition, and I called her.

08:23.278 --> 08:25.211
She's doing her dissertation
on it at Catholic U.

08:25.212 --> 08:26.859
A grad student?

08:26.860 --> 08:28.945
One who I'm being
incredibly rude to right now.

08:28.946 --> 08:30.579
We were in the middle
of a highly charged

08:30.580 --> 08:32.510
discussion on transubstantiation.

08:32.511 --> 08:34.110
Come meet her...

08:34.111 --> 08:35.711
if you want to.

08:35.712 --> 08:38.711
No, I'm already late for work.

08:38.712 --> 08:40.376
Just don't get fired, please.

08:40.378 --> 08:42.544
Your mother will blame me.

08:42.544 --> 08:44.277
Okay.

08:44.278 --> 08:46.045
- Okay.
- Bye.

08:46.046 --> 08:47.077
I'll see you tonight?

08:47.078 --> 08:50.112
Yeah.

09:10.399 --> 09:12.342
TED: And so, it's only fitting
that I share the honor

09:12.343 --> 09:15.852
of christening Hepanza
Chemical's newest plant

09:15.853 --> 09:18.152
with Secretary Elizabeth McCord

09:18.153 --> 09:20.658
and the Minister of External Affairs...

09:20.659 --> 09:23.591
Chondita Samant.

09:24.223 --> 09:26.357
Thank you, ladies.

09:27.390 --> 09:29.289
ELIZABETH: Thank you, Ted.

09:29.290 --> 09:31.322
Minister Samant.

09:31.323 --> 09:33.923
As we bear witness to this plant,

09:33.924 --> 09:37.489
this feat of Indo-American cooperation,

09:37.490 --> 09:40.289
we hope it will be the delta
of a renewed friendship...

09:40.290 --> 09:43.090
Remind me when it became our job
to do a Hepanza infomercial?

09:43.091 --> 09:45.589
It's our job to execute the
president's foreign policy,

09:45.590 --> 09:48.123
whether we like it or not.

09:48.124 --> 09:49.823
The plant visit was his idea.

09:49.824 --> 09:51.791
Let the hallowed waters of the Ganges do

09:51.792 --> 09:53.424
the same for us

09:53.425 --> 09:55.058
so both our nations

09:55.059 --> 09:56.190
can become...

09:56.191 --> 09:59.824
"partners in profits,"

09:59.825 --> 10:01.424
to borrow Ted's phrase.

10:01.425 --> 10:02.857
Oof. Can we give it back?

10:02.858 --> 10:05.290
That's straight out of
Hepanza's press kit.

10:05.291 --> 10:07.657
She fought it, but his
PR team insisted.

10:07.658 --> 10:09.912
It's the only compromise,
but the rest, it's all her.

10:09.913 --> 10:11.625
By which you mean all you.

10:11.626 --> 10:13.886
Gentlemen, every news outlet

10:13.887 --> 10:15.920
on Earth has a camera trained on you

10:15.921 --> 10:18.654
hoping to catch an errant
phrase or awkward back rub.

10:18.655 --> 10:19.753
So, please,

10:19.754 --> 10:21.153
for the sake of the secretary,

10:21.154 --> 10:23.753
I humbly request that you shut it.

10:23.754 --> 10:26.054
Thank you.

10:34.820 --> 10:36.120
Great job, Madam Secretary.

10:36.121 --> 10:37.886
Thanks.

10:37.887 --> 10:40.587
You think Minister Samant
is warming up to me yet?

10:40.588 --> 10:41.886
Possibly.

10:41.887 --> 10:43.187
What is that?

10:43.188 --> 10:44.853
Is that a smile?

10:44.854 --> 10:47.020
Or a smirk?

10:47.021 --> 10:48.086
It's a little of both.

10:48.087 --> 10:50.454
It's a smirkle.

10:53.588 --> 10:55.753
Look, I need you to hear
what I'm saying right now.

10:55.754 --> 10:57.953
- Mm-hmm.
- I leave for Nantucket tomorrow.

10:57.954 --> 10:59.554
When I get back it's
over... I'm serious.

10:59.555 --> 11:01.654
- I got it.
- Listen to me. Seriously.

11:01.655 --> 11:04.886
You are not and never have been
a candidate for my affection.

11:04.887 --> 11:07.420
Long term, you're not
someone I could ever be with.

11:07.421 --> 11:09.487
I'm in love with Win.

11:09.488 --> 11:10.520
You're serious?

11:10.521 --> 11:12.554
Which is why I keep using that word.

11:12.555 --> 11:14.387
Okay, you want to get serious?

11:14.388 --> 11:17.353
Why are you with "Winthrop" anyway?

11:17.354 --> 11:19.920
Because... he's smart.

11:19.921 --> 11:20.886
Smart. Mm.

11:20.887 --> 11:22.053
Well read, articulate.

11:22.054 --> 11:23.153
Good with people.

11:23.154 --> 11:24.287
Motivated, ambitious.

11:24.288 --> 11:25.554
He's a lobbyist for weed.

11:25.555 --> 11:26.753
Alternative health care.

11:26.754 --> 11:28.753
He believes in what he does.

11:28.754 --> 11:30.120
And he believes in what I do.

11:30.121 --> 11:31.086
He respects me.

11:31.087 --> 11:32.053
He's rooting for me.

11:32.054 --> 11:34.554
We have a future together.

11:34.555 --> 11:35.920
Who you trying to convince?

11:35.921 --> 11:36.920
No one.

11:36.921 --> 11:38.621
I'm just making it clear.

11:39.354 --> 11:41.187
(clatter)

11:41.188 --> 11:43.153
- Oh, crap.
- Hey, hey, hey, don't dismiss me.

11:43.154 --> 11:44.287
No, no, no, look, look.

11:44.288 --> 11:46.488
M-Sec's mystery daughter.

11:53.921 --> 11:55.453
Oh, crap.

11:55.454 --> 11:56.453
Mm-hmm.

11:56.454 --> 11:57.654
Okay, um...

11:57.655 --> 11:58.719
You leave first,

11:58.720 --> 12:00.119
and I'll figure a way out the back.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.214
We can't just leave her,
I mean, clearly she's wasted.

12:02.215 --> 12:04.276
- Yeah.
- Not to mention underage.

12:04.277 --> 12:05.276
Okay, okay.

12:05.277 --> 12:06.909
Let me lay out a few scenarios here.

12:06.910 --> 12:08.976
One... we take her home
now and deliver to daddy

12:08.977 --> 12:11.209
this portrait of a
daughter as a young drunk,

12:11.210 --> 12:13.309
and reveal to the one
person who shares a pillow

12:13.310 --> 12:15.243
with the secretary that
we were out alone.

12:15.244 --> 12:16.243
Or two,

12:16.244 --> 12:18.109
we leave, none of that happens.

12:18.110 --> 12:20.209
And let some <i>Daily
Caller</i> blogger find her?

12:20.210 --> 12:22.143
If it hits the Web, I'm
the one on the phone

12:22.144 --> 12:24.609
with <i>The Daily Show,</i> begging
them not to open with it.

12:24.610 --> 12:25.942
- It's none of our business.
- Isn't it?

12:25.943 --> 12:27.577
She can take care of herself.

12:31.943 --> 12:33.575
Okay, um...

12:33.576 --> 12:35.709
I'll leave first.

12:35.710 --> 12:37.776
I advise you to do the same.

12:37.777 --> 12:39.410
Don't...

12:45.743 --> 12:47.877
(clears throat)

12:50.743 --> 12:52.776
Hi, Stevie.

12:52.777 --> 12:53.809
I'm Daisy.

12:53.810 --> 12:55.809
We met a long time ago.

12:55.810 --> 12:57.477
Um, I work for your mom.

13:00.210 --> 13:01.876
Can you get me another Long Island?

13:01.877 --> 13:04.809
Trust me, you don't want that.

13:04.810 --> 13:06.376
Coffee, black.

13:06.377 --> 13:08.676
(low chatter)

13:11.477 --> 13:14.143
Your cabinet told the
Hindustan Free Press

13:14.144 --> 13:16.009
that my Hepanza speech
was nothing more

13:16.010 --> 13:17.575
than foreign carpetbagging.

13:17.576 --> 13:19.842
Their words, but I don't disagree.

13:19.843 --> 13:20.876
Is that a fight?

13:20.877 --> 13:21.976
Well, in this heat,

13:21.977 --> 13:23.686
I'm surprised we're not
all coming to blows.

13:23.687 --> 13:25.143
SCOTT: Maybe it's not a fight.

13:25.144 --> 13:26.675
Maybe it's...

13:26.676 --> 13:27.776
a lively debate.

13:27.777 --> 13:29.076
It's probably about your speech.

13:29.077 --> 13:30.575
For real?

13:30.576 --> 13:32.542
It's not a fight.

13:32.543 --> 13:34.476
So you also believe
that the average Indian

13:34.477 --> 13:36.510
derives no benefit from
foreign investment?

13:36.511 --> 13:39.510
You mean other than higher wages
to spend on American goods?

13:39.511 --> 13:42.176
No, I'm talking about an
emergent middle class,

13:42.177 --> 13:43.842
with, yes, spending power,

13:43.843 --> 13:46.742
but also with time to
invest in literacy,

13:46.743 --> 13:48.376
education, innovation,

13:48.377 --> 13:49.876
all the things that make India

13:49.877 --> 13:51.843
the democratic partner
America sought out.

13:51.844 --> 13:53.809
You are as described.

13:53.810 --> 13:56.675
"As wrongheaded as she
is blonde-headed"?

13:56.676 --> 13:58.109
(laughs)

13:58.110 --> 14:00.909
Got quite the wordsmiths over
at the Hindustan Free Press.

14:00.910 --> 14:02.309
Passionate.

14:02.310 --> 14:03.876
I like passionate.

14:03.877 --> 14:05.443
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

14:05.444 --> 14:06.575
See?! See, I told you.

14:06.576 --> 14:07.675
It wasn't a fight.

14:07.676 --> 14:08.642
Well, not yet.

14:08.643 --> 14:10.210
How are you both not sweating?

14:11.910 --> 14:13.344
I'll be right back.

14:22.444 --> 14:24.009
Hello.

14:24.010 --> 14:25.376
Uh, Alison.

14:25.377 --> 14:26.542
I'm Sanjay.

14:26.543 --> 14:28.476
Hi.

14:28.477 --> 14:29.675
How do you know my name?

14:29.676 --> 14:31.976
Well, I pay attention.

14:31.977 --> 14:34.177
Which is how I know
you have beautiful eyes.

14:35.310 --> 14:37.477
Have you ever seen a peacock?

14:38.210 --> 14:40.776
Several roam the grounds.

14:40.777 --> 14:42.809
Shall we take a walk?

14:42.810 --> 14:44.575
Okay, just so you know,

14:44.576 --> 14:46.376
she went nuts on the garlic naan.

14:46.377 --> 14:48.144
I'd love a walk.

14:50.511 --> 14:52.310
You are the worst.

15:02.843 --> 15:04.909
Mmm.

15:04.910 --> 15:08.710
That is so good.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.743
So, you want to talk about it?

15:13.511 --> 15:15.510
The sandwich?

15:15.511 --> 15:17.709
Why you're getting
drunk in a bar alone.

15:17.710 --> 15:19.210
Ah.

15:22.411 --> 15:24.709
(softly): Because...

15:24.710 --> 15:26.976
Because he's a cheater.

15:26.977 --> 15:29.277
That sucks.

15:31.277 --> 15:32.776
But you're young.

15:32.777 --> 15:34.577
You'll find somebody else.

15:35.444 --> 15:37.210
My dad.

15:39.910 --> 15:43.176
He's a cheating cheater who cheats.

15:43.177 --> 15:46.176
And then lies about cheating.

15:46.177 --> 15:48.144
(sniffles)

15:49.110 --> 15:53.176
Um, I saw him having lunch
yesterday with some...

15:53.177 --> 15:55.210
skank, she was barely older than me.

15:55.211 --> 15:56.309
Wait, wait, hang on.

15:56.310 --> 15:58.127
It might not have been
what it looked like.

15:58.610 --> 16:00.675
I know.

16:00.676 --> 16:02.876
So, today I checked.

16:02.877 --> 16:06.476
He's supposedly writing this book.

16:06.477 --> 16:08.009
Researching 24-7.

16:08.010 --> 16:11.243
Which is the whole reason
that he couldn't go to India.

16:11.244 --> 16:13.343
But I asked around,

16:13.344 --> 16:16.110
and he hasn't been
in the archives in weeks.

16:17.411 --> 16:20.243
(laughs): The lady at the
front desk even said,

16:20.244 --> 16:23.676
"Hey, tell him we miss
him around here."

16:26.810 --> 16:29.276
And now you know.

16:29.277 --> 16:32.210
The McCord family business.

16:34.177 --> 16:35.876
Hey, how's it going?

16:35.877 --> 16:38.609
My kingdom for a cheeseburger.

16:38.610 --> 16:40.575
All right, where's your sister?

16:40.576 --> 16:42.876
She went off with some strange guy.

16:42.877 --> 16:44.600
- Excuse me?
- He was her age.

16:44.601 --> 16:46.121
His dad's one of the Indian officials.

16:46.122 --> 16:47.843
- Where'd they go?
- To look at peacocks.

16:47.844 --> 16:49.976
Yeah, classic Indian pickup line.

16:49.977 --> 16:51.143
I guess.

16:51.144 --> 16:52.742
(chuckles)

16:52.743 --> 16:54.410
(rattling)

16:54.411 --> 16:55.810
What's that?

17:00.710 --> 17:02.376
(rattling stops)

17:02.377 --> 17:04.742
It's just... just a tremor.

17:04.742 --> 17:06.709
Okay?

17:06.710 --> 17:08.742
(loud rumbling)

17:08.742 --> 17:10.042
(people screaming)

17:10.044 --> 17:12.344
(glass shattering)

17:15.643 --> 17:16.842
FRED: Madam Secretary.

17:16.843 --> 17:18.942
You stay with Jason.
I've got to go get Alison.

17:18.943 --> 17:20.376
I can't let you do that, ma'am.

17:20.377 --> 17:23.710
- She's out there.
- This way, ma'am, this way, ma'am.

17:35.361 --> 17:37.525
- Fred, I'd like to go back out there.
- Ma'am.

17:37.526 --> 17:39.193
- Ma'am.
- You're doing your job, I appreciate that.

17:39.194 --> 17:41.126
- Four DS agents are searching for her now.
- Yeah, okay.

17:41.127 --> 17:43.017
- Please stay...
- We don't know what it's like out there.

17:43.018 --> 17:44.258
We're still getting aftershocks.

17:44.259 --> 17:45.193
This is a command, I want...

17:45.194 --> 17:46.492
We will find Alison.

17:46.493 --> 17:49.159
Ma'am, please.

17:49.160 --> 17:51.026
Ma'am, I spoke to the consul.

17:51.027 --> 17:52.525
It's a 7.3 quake.

17:52.526 --> 17:54.159
How many dead?

17:54.160 --> 17:56.360
I heard a report that a hospital
and a school collapsed.

17:56.361 --> 17:59.026
Could be as much as a thousand there.

17:59.027 --> 18:00.993
Mom. Look.

18:03.260 --> 18:04.494
Oh.

18:10.560 --> 18:15.460
MAN: The 7.3 earthquake
struck just after 8:00 p.m.

18:15.461 --> 18:18.726
Secretary of State Elizabeth
McCord was already in India...

18:18.727 --> 18:20.625
DAISY: Thank God she's all right.

18:20.626 --> 18:21.922
I know.

18:21.923 --> 18:24.655
Is it wrong that I'm glad
my passport got held up?

18:24.656 --> 18:26.955
No, I'd feel the same way.

18:26.956 --> 18:28.855
I'm sorry you have
to miss your wedding.

18:28.856 --> 18:30.022
It's okay.

18:30.023 --> 18:31.550
- The official death toll...
- Win understood.

18:31.551 --> 18:33.689
of the quake at this hour is over 1,000.

18:33.690 --> 18:35.989
But these are early numbers.

18:35.990 --> 18:38.314
The kid's sure he's cheating on her?

18:38.823 --> 18:40.321
That wasn't just something she said?

18:40.322 --> 18:43.222
Because, you know, people do
all kinds of crazy things

18:43.223 --> 18:45.488
under the influence of tequila.

18:45.489 --> 18:47.122
I stuffed her with grilled cheese,

18:47.123 --> 18:48.455
she made a lot of sense.

18:48.456 --> 18:50.855
Wow.

18:50.856 --> 18:53.022
So, I should tell the secretary, right?

18:53.023 --> 18:56.455
And be the woman who told
her boss about the other woman?

18:56.456 --> 18:58.047
That makes you the other other woman.

18:58.048 --> 18:59.389
That's the worst woman of all.

18:59.390 --> 19:02.355
That woman's so bad, she's
not even in a country song.

19:02.356 --> 19:04.189
- Okay, that's not helpful.
- You asked.

19:04.190 --> 19:05.421
So, what happened to the kid?

19:05.422 --> 19:06.722
Did you leave her in the bar?

19:06.723 --> 19:09.355
No, I put her in a cab.

19:09.356 --> 19:12.355
...a problem in the poorest
rural areas of India,

19:12.356 --> 19:14.488
even in the best of times.

19:14.489 --> 19:16.456
- She should be on now.
- Oh, oh.

19:18.356 --> 19:19.421
MATT: Hey.

19:19.422 --> 19:21.183
DAISY: It's good to see
you, Madam Secretary.

19:21.184 --> 19:22.156
Good morning.

19:22.157 --> 19:23.989
It is morning there, right?

19:23.990 --> 19:25.355
Sort of lost track of time.

19:25.356 --> 19:26.455
You've been busy.

19:26.456 --> 19:28.588
We managed to get the
kids on a flight home,

19:28.589 --> 19:30.355
and it's been nonstop since then.

19:30.356 --> 19:32.488
Well, we saw you on TV with USAID

19:32.489 --> 19:35.355
<i>and the India NDMA overseeing
the survivor search.</i>

19:35.356 --> 19:38.488
The scale of loss is...

19:38.489 --> 19:40.522
There's still so much to be done.

19:40.523 --> 19:43.522
Well, the images of you
and Foreign Minister Samant

19:43.523 --> 19:46.488
<i>at the field hospital in
Jundip are very powerful.</i>

19:46.489 --> 19:48.421
Chondita's been relentless.

19:48.422 --> 19:50.588
DOD's transferring troops
from Afghanistan to aid

19:50.589 --> 19:52.041
in the relief effort like you asked.

19:52.042 --> 19:55.755
And OFDA and USAID are in touch
with the Embassy in New Delhi

19:55.756 --> 19:57.321
to provide greater regional support.

19:57.322 --> 19:58.370
Good, good.

19:58.371 --> 20:01.152
And if it isn't already done,
activate an RMT in DC.

20:01.153 --> 20:02.685
- Done.
- And, Matt,

20:02.686 --> 20:04.630
all communications from State need

20:04.631 --> 20:06.230
to include donation information.

20:06.231 --> 20:09.029
I-I'm looking at a press release
right here, there's nothing.

20:09.030 --> 20:10.262
Well, Scott usually handles that.

20:10.263 --> 20:12.196
Well, Scott's busy; I'm
asking you to do it.

20:12.197 --> 20:15.963
Well, there is a little
silver lining to all of this.

20:15.964 --> 20:18.395
Every major news outlet
has coverage of you

20:18.396 --> 20:20.529
moving sandbags, helping
with the survivor search.

20:20.530 --> 20:21.896
From a communications standpoint,

20:21.897 --> 20:23.363
the trip's a huge success.

20:24.964 --> 20:27.896
I didn't mean that to
sound opportunistic.

20:27.897 --> 20:29.930
How did you mean it to sound?

20:31.097 --> 20:32.395
I'm getting on a plane tonight.

20:32.396 --> 20:34.462
I'll be far more effective in DC.

20:34.463 --> 20:36.629
In the meantime, I'll
whip up an exit address.

20:36.630 --> 20:37.729
Scott's already on it.

20:37.730 --> 20:39.463
I'll see you tomorrow.

20:40.263 --> 20:41.662
Scott's on it.

20:41.663 --> 20:43.897
Really?

20:46.930 --> 20:49.096
- HENRY: Hey, look what I've got!
- (gasps)

20:49.097 --> 20:51.329
Ah! I can't believe I mean this,

20:51.330 --> 20:54.696
but I am so happy to see you losers.

20:54.697 --> 20:57.196
(grunting happily)

20:57.197 --> 20:58.496
You hungry?

20:58.497 --> 20:59.529
Starving.

20:59.530 --> 21:01.295
<i>Voila, Les enfants.</i>

21:01.296 --> 21:03.262
Fluffernutters and curly fries.

21:03.263 --> 21:05.130
Ooh, finally some normal food.

21:05.131 --> 21:06.562
How can you care about food?

21:06.563 --> 21:07.562
Ah, here we go.

21:07.563 --> 21:08.529
What?

21:08.530 --> 21:09.696
Sanjay's house was crushed.

21:09.697 --> 21:10.863
He lost everything.

21:10.864 --> 21:11.996
It's horrible.

21:11.997 --> 21:14.029
15 hours on the plane,
can't get enough.

21:14.030 --> 21:16.029
Do you not care about
what we just went through?

21:16.030 --> 21:17.662
I do care, but it's over.

21:17.663 --> 21:18.863
- It's over for you.
- Okay.

21:18.864 --> 21:19.896
Honey, it's gonna be okay.

21:19.897 --> 21:22.064
No, it's not, and you don't know that.

21:25.030 --> 21:26.462
Nice work defusing that situation.

21:26.463 --> 21:28.629
Just trying to calm her down.

21:28.630 --> 21:31.130
Shouldn't you be at the archives?

21:31.131 --> 21:32.829
That librarian is really...

21:32.830 --> 21:34.496
Stevie, cut it out.

21:34.497 --> 21:36.597
Cutting it out.

21:45.231 --> 21:47.797
(cell phone buzzing)

21:50.363 --> 21:51.729
Hello?

21:51.730 --> 21:53.696
Oh, good. I'm glad I caught you.

21:53.697 --> 21:55.763
Everything okay?

21:55.764 --> 21:57.529
Check your inbox.

21:57.530 --> 22:00.763
Yeah, the kids are...

22:00.764 --> 22:04.329
Uh... well, they're a little
shaken, but they're fine.

22:04.330 --> 22:07.596
Um, listen, I wanted to talk to you.

22:07.597 --> 22:10.262
There's something that...

22:10.263 --> 22:11.296
you should know.

22:11.297 --> 22:12.429
Is it about your work?

22:12.430 --> 22:13.696
Well, it's related.

22:13.697 --> 22:15.796
BLAKE: Madam Secretary...

22:15.797 --> 22:17.230
NADINE: The Hepanza plant we visited?

22:17.231 --> 22:18.596
The quake caused

22:18.597 --> 22:20.429
a crack in a tank

22:20.430 --> 22:21.863
that was holding a severely toxic,

22:21.864 --> 22:23.863
highly flammable chemical called aniline.

22:23.864 --> 22:25.063
Henry, I think I need

22:25.064 --> 22:26.063
to call you back.

22:26.064 --> 22:27.063
Is that okay?

22:27.064 --> 22:28.796
Yeah, don't worry.

22:28.797 --> 22:30.796
The leak ignited, causing a blast.

22:30.797 --> 22:31.896
BLAKE: 4,000 dead

22:31.897 --> 22:33.997
- and counting.
- ELIZABETH: All right.

22:36.964 --> 22:38.662
ELIZABETH: <i>What is the latest</i>

22:38.663 --> 22:40.230
with the fire? Is it contained?

22:40.231 --> 22:41.197
Not even close.

22:41.198 --> 22:43.262
Why is that possible?

22:43.263 --> 22:45.130
It's been burning for 15 hours straight.

22:45.131 --> 22:47.362
The aniline burns so hot
that the cleanup crew

22:47.363 --> 22:48.924
can't get to the leak source.

22:48.925 --> 22:50.797
Of course aniline's alternate
use had to be jet fuel.

22:50.798 --> 22:53.063
Millions of gallons of this toxic stuff

22:53.064 --> 22:54.130
is spilling into the Ganges.

22:54.131 --> 22:55.562
BLAKE: Do you know how many people

22:55.563 --> 22:57.429
use that river every
day to cook and bathe?

22:57.430 --> 22:59.362
How many are downstream?
Could we evacuate?

22:59.363 --> 23:01.096
Try moving that many
people on a Tuesday,

23:01.097 --> 23:02.662
let alone after an earthquake.

23:02.663 --> 23:04.262
If we don't tamp down the fire,

23:04.263 --> 23:06.662
and plug the leak, hundreds of thousands

23:06.663 --> 23:08.596
of people risk exposure and death.

23:08.597 --> 23:11.529
We have to get the Hotshots
in there right away.

23:11.530 --> 23:12.462
...explosion, the Ganges

23:12.463 --> 23:14.896
- continues to burn out of control.
- What about Hepanza's tank?

23:14.897 --> 23:16.163
Do we know why it failed?

23:16.164 --> 23:17.496
Well, here's the thing: It didn't.

23:17.497 --> 23:18.696
Hepanza was compliant with

23:18.697 --> 23:21.029
Indian Ministry of
Industrial Protocol standards

23:21.030 --> 23:22.395
requiring tanks to sustain

23:22.396 --> 23:24.196
magnitude 7.0 quakes.

23:24.197 --> 23:26.163
Which does no one any
good when a 7.3 hits.

23:26.164 --> 23:27.963
BLAKE: MIP standards are
lower than America's.

23:27.964 --> 23:29.196
ELIZABETH: And cheaper to implement,

23:29.197 --> 23:30.295
which is exactly why

23:30.296 --> 23:32.329
Hepanza was in India
in the first place.

23:32.330 --> 23:34.496
So Hepanza isn't liable, nor is the

23:34.497 --> 23:35.510
Indian government.

23:35.511 --> 23:37.406
Let's focus on getting
the fire under control.

23:37.407 --> 23:39.266
- We can finger-point later.
- Yeah.

23:39.267 --> 23:41.025
Madam Secretary, if I can
interrupt for a minute.

23:41.026 --> 23:44.029
NEWS ANCHOR: Here's U.S. Secretary
of State, Elizabeth McCord,

23:44.030 --> 23:46.295
just hours before the
quake that would cause

23:46.296 --> 23:48.896
the deadly spill and the Ganges to burn.

23:48.897 --> 23:51.163
We hope it will be the delta
of a renewed friendship,

23:51.164 --> 23:54.196
as strong and sacred
as the Ganges River

23:54.197 --> 23:55.729
on whose banks it stands.

23:55.730 --> 23:58.230
They've been playing those
two clips on loop all morning.

23:58.231 --> 23:59.929
Water is burning, Madam Secretary.

23:59.930 --> 24:01.147
And your name is linked to it.

24:01.148 --> 24:04.166
- The optics of this couldn't be worse.
- Optics? Seriously?

24:04.167 --> 24:05.661
I'm sorry, it's my job to tell you that.

24:05.662 --> 24:06.896
I know I've already said it...

24:06.897 --> 24:07.996
I am so sorry

24:07.997 --> 24:09.696
about the Ganges metaphor in the speech.

24:09.697 --> 24:11.074
Nice work with that.

24:11.075 --> 24:12.663
DAISY: I read Nadine's proposal.

24:12.664 --> 24:14.395
Do we really think gas fire fighters

24:14.396 --> 24:15.863
can contain a chemical fire?

24:15.864 --> 24:18.329
The Texas Hotshots were on call

24:18.330 --> 24:21.829
during the Kuwaiti oil fires
and Deepwater Horizon.

24:21.830 --> 24:24.863
They are <i>the</i> best
firefighters in the world.

24:24.864 --> 24:27.056
All right, well, we really can't
afford another PR mishap.

24:27.057 --> 24:29.429
ELIZABETH: Daisy, while I
appreciate that it's your job

24:29.430 --> 24:31.503
to tell me about the PR fallout,

24:31.504 --> 24:33.492
it is my job to put it
in order of importance.

24:33.493 --> 24:35.562
And right now, we can't
leave a renewed ally

24:35.563 --> 24:36.896
twisting in the wind.

24:36.897 --> 24:40.996
Nadine, get the embassy
and the USAID in Delhi

24:40.997 --> 24:42.729
- prepared to receive the Hotshots.
- Yes, ma'am.

24:42.730 --> 24:44.096
Blake, get me Minister Samant.

24:44.097 --> 24:45.729
I want to download her personally.

24:45.730 --> 24:47.566
- Okay.
- Lastly, I need a statement

24:47.567 --> 24:49.196
outlining State's response

24:49.197 --> 24:50.395
to the containment efforts.

24:50.396 --> 24:51.395
- Got it.
- I'm on it.

24:51.396 --> 24:52.562
- I got it.
- I got it.

24:52.563 --> 24:53.529
I got it.

24:53.530 --> 24:55.629
Oh, for Pete's sake!

24:55.630 --> 24:56.929
Work together.

24:56.930 --> 24:58.029
You're right.

24:58.030 --> 25:00.395
Come on.

25:00.396 --> 25:01.963
But the Hotshots are in the air.

25:01.964 --> 25:04.063
And I'm afraid that once they land,

25:04.064 --> 25:05.829
we will be forced to turn them back.

25:05.830 --> 25:06.929
But why?

25:06.930 --> 25:08.064
I don't understand.

25:08.065 --> 25:10.629
We are willing to accept
U.S. containment aid,

25:10.630 --> 25:13.362
but Hepanza must apologize
for this disaster first.

25:13.363 --> 25:15.063
The United States, like India,

25:15.064 --> 25:16.329
is a democracy.

25:16.330 --> 25:19.496
I can't force liability
on a private company.

25:19.497 --> 25:22.029
Then perhaps you can persuade them

25:22.030 --> 25:23.574
to take it on themselves.

25:23.575 --> 25:25.296
We were in India
together just a day ago.

25:25.297 --> 25:29.295
We watched USAID work with India's NDMA

25:29.296 --> 25:30.629
with great success after the quake.

25:30.630 --> 25:31.896
And for that we are very grateful.

25:31.897 --> 25:33.929
So why can't that partnership continue?

25:33.930 --> 25:35.996
Why-why is this spill any different?

25:35.997 --> 25:39.063
The earthquake was an act of God.

25:39.064 --> 25:40.829
But a chemical spill

25:40.830 --> 25:42.163
at the hands of

25:42.164 --> 25:43.529
an American corporation?

25:43.530 --> 25:45.063
To Prime Minister Saigal,

25:45.064 --> 25:48.362
it feels like a sign,

25:48.363 --> 25:51.964
punishment for opening the door
wider to foreign investment.

25:53.964 --> 25:56.295
Hepanza adhered to MIP standards,

25:56.296 --> 25:58.929
sanctioned by the Indian government.

25:58.930 --> 26:02.163
Saigal has branded himself.

26:02.164 --> 26:04.029
India's great nationalist.

26:04.030 --> 26:06.329
For him to accepting help
from the American government

26:06.330 --> 26:11.562
for an industrial disaster
at an American plant

26:11.563 --> 26:12.562
tarnishes that image.

26:12.563 --> 26:14.362
So pride wins over compassion

26:14.363 --> 26:15.896
and millions of Indians pay?

26:15.897 --> 26:18.629
It's an emotional response

26:18.630 --> 26:22.096
from a new, untested reactionary

26:22.097 --> 26:23.929
and his cabinet of cronies.

26:23.930 --> 26:25.763
Yourself included?

26:25.764 --> 26:29.430
The apology stipulation was my idea.

26:30.296 --> 26:33.063
It was the best I could
do to help my people.

26:33.064 --> 26:35.562
I'm not in a position to give you that.

26:35.563 --> 26:38.596
Then I am not in a position
to accept American aid.

26:38.597 --> 26:39.729
That is where we are.

26:39.730 --> 26:42.030
I'm sorry.

26:51.464 --> 26:52.563
TED: <i>Absolutely not.</i>

26:52.564 --> 26:54.477
I will not apologize.

26:54.478 --> 26:55.912
Hepanza did nothing wrong.

26:55.913 --> 26:57.245
It's out of the question.

26:57.246 --> 26:59.442
India can't make a U.S. company
genuflect on command.

26:59.443 --> 27:01.444
Then consider a compromise.

27:01.445 --> 27:03.678
Look, the Hotshots are India's best hope

27:03.679 --> 27:06.078
at stopping the fire and
plugging this leak.

27:06.079 --> 27:08.478
TED: Yeah, and who's on
it in the meantime? Us.

27:08.479 --> 27:10.212
Hepanza has set up clinics,

27:10.213 --> 27:12.411
we've set up a victims' relief fund,

27:12.412 --> 27:14.511
we've done everything possible
to mitigate this leak.

27:14.512 --> 27:15.645
Well, not everything.

27:15.646 --> 27:17.358
Do you know what my
lawyers would do to me

27:17.359 --> 27:18.878
if I accepted liability?

27:18.879 --> 27:20.078
And that would be a cakewalk

27:20.079 --> 27:21.812
compared to my shareholders' reaction.

27:21.813 --> 27:23.978
Then give me something
to bring back to Saigal.

27:23.979 --> 27:26.179
Hepanza did nothing wrong.

27:26.180 --> 27:28.686
The tank was up to Indian standards.

27:30.118 --> 27:32.349
Elevating the metal grade to U.S. standards

27:32.350 --> 27:33.878
would have cost you $200,000.

27:33.879 --> 27:35.978
That's a drop in the
bucket for a corporation

27:35.979 --> 27:38.145
that took in $2 billion last year alone.

27:38.146 --> 27:39.411
Madam Secretary, my job as...

27:39.412 --> 27:41.444
Mr. President, you convinced
me of the importance

27:41.445 --> 27:43.145
of an Indo-American partnership.

27:43.146 --> 27:45.511
Let's not let this
overshadow our gains.

27:45.512 --> 27:47.845
That's precisely why India and Hepanza

27:47.846 --> 27:50.046
have to sort this out alone.

27:54.612 --> 27:56.596
Sir.

27:57.679 --> 27:58.986
I guess we should have let Saigal

27:58.987 --> 28:00.646
cool off post-election after all.

28:00.647 --> 28:03.679
For the record, I thought
Turkey was a great idea.

28:07.746 --> 28:08.745
Hey.

28:08.746 --> 28:10.645
I need you to talk to Scott.

28:10.646 --> 28:12.179
All right.

28:12.180 --> 28:13.611
But I'm a little troubled

28:13.612 --> 28:15.245
that my head communicator can't.

28:15.246 --> 28:16.611
Oh, I have.

28:16.612 --> 28:18.611
But he insists on taking
the lead with India.

28:18.612 --> 28:22.179
Kid thinks he's been touched by
some divine and inspired right.

28:22.180 --> 28:24.545
Just because I had a passport issue.

28:29.180 --> 28:30.478
Do you really think

28:30.479 --> 28:33.444
that the lead diplomat for
the United States of America

28:33.445 --> 28:36.313
can't handle the Diplomatic
Passport Office?

28:37.445 --> 28:40.311
I used it as an opportunity
to test out Scott.

28:40.312 --> 28:42.478
He's hungrier, Matt. I mean, admit it,

28:42.479 --> 28:44.077
your heart's not really in this job.

28:44.078 --> 28:44.846
- What?
- Come on,

28:44.847 --> 28:46.978
you've been clocking the
exit since I started.

28:46.979 --> 28:48.212
I know you revised your résumé.

28:48.213 --> 28:49.578
Okay, yeah, but that was because,

28:49.579 --> 28:52.478
uh, because you were
gonna fire everybody.

28:52.479 --> 28:53.912
No, it's not that. I...

28:53.913 --> 28:56.411
I saw your work for Marsh.

28:56.412 --> 28:57.812
I know what you're capable of.

28:57.813 --> 28:58.845
But lately?

28:58.846 --> 29:00.628
You're not serious about the work.

29:00.629 --> 29:01.946
- I am.
- I don't see it.

29:02.846 --> 29:04.711
It's not that I think Scott's a genius.

29:04.712 --> 29:06.878
He's green. I'd have to

29:06.879 --> 29:08.678
guide him, bring him along.

29:08.679 --> 29:12.578
But, boy, he's all in.

29:12.579 --> 29:14.511
It's not your talent I'm questioning.

29:14.512 --> 29:16.311
It's your level of commitment.

29:16.312 --> 29:19.711
Are you a serious person?

29:19.712 --> 29:22.512
Because I only have time
for people who are.

29:26.746 --> 29:29.046
(talking over each other)

29:30.612 --> 29:31.745
Ma'am...

29:31.746 --> 29:35.279
could Hepanza temporarily
hire the Hotshots?

29:35.280 --> 29:37.478
Just... slip them in as employees?

29:37.479 --> 29:39.633
If I thought I could get
Ted Graham to do anything,

29:39.634 --> 29:40.778
we wouldn't be here.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.078
Let's keep thinking on it.

29:42.079 --> 29:44.912
Can I take the conversation
in a different direction?

29:44.913 --> 29:45.978
Please, be my guest.

29:45.979 --> 29:47.378
We're past salvaging this.

29:47.379 --> 29:49.311
What we can save is your standing.

29:49.312 --> 29:51.123
We need to spin the Hepanza visit.

29:51.124 --> 29:51.778
No.

29:51.779 --> 29:53.179
I stood with Ted Graham

29:53.180 --> 29:54.912
hours before the blast.

29:54.913 --> 29:57.478
No amount of spin is going
to ever change that.

29:57.479 --> 29:59.778
- The president's office forced you.
- I sanctioned it.

29:59.779 --> 30:01.411
Well, at least we can
hope to make up for

30:01.412 --> 30:03.463
- your part in it, I mean...
- No, the only way

30:03.464 --> 30:04.913
to make up for my part in this

30:04.914 --> 30:07.511
is to find a solution.

30:07.512 --> 30:09.409
My image can wait.

30:09.813 --> 30:11.145
You know what?

30:11.146 --> 30:12.179
Let's take a break.

30:12.180 --> 30:14.412
We'll meet back here in an hour.

30:21.879 --> 30:23.245
I don't mean to speak out of turn,

30:23.246 --> 30:25.812
but I just got called out
for doing my job back there.

30:25.813 --> 30:27.778
I was looking for a little bit more

30:27.779 --> 30:30.012
than simple press manipulation.

30:30.013 --> 30:32.248
I know you don't love
dealing with the media,

30:32.249 --> 30:33.378
but they're a reality.

30:33.379 --> 30:34.750
If I didn't do my job,

30:34.751 --> 30:36.051
the press would define you,

30:36.052 --> 30:37.817
leaving you with zero political capital.

30:37.818 --> 30:40.118
You're right.

30:40.818 --> 30:42.285
Anything else?

30:44.052 --> 30:46.483
Uh, there is one more thing.

30:46.484 --> 30:49.017
I only bring it up because
it might become an issue.

30:49.018 --> 30:50.285
It's about your husband.

30:52.518 --> 30:54.117
I have a source...

30:54.118 --> 30:55.217
a very close one...

30:55.218 --> 30:57.184
who tells me he's having an affair.

30:57.185 --> 30:58.850
Now, maybe he isn't.

30:58.851 --> 31:01.284
But he's been seen around
town with a younger woman.

31:01.285 --> 31:03.918
If it gets out, it could
devastate your policy work.

31:04.963 --> 31:06.308
Daisy, you're pushing a line.

31:06.309 --> 31:08.180
Madam Secretary, it's my
job to tell you when...

31:08.181 --> 31:09.251
It's your job to make

31:09.252 --> 31:11.217
suggestions based on facts.

31:11.218 --> 31:12.460
Not cast aspersions

31:12.461 --> 31:14.042
because of your situation with Matt.

31:14.579 --> 31:15.717
Which is your business.

31:15.718 --> 31:17.517
But it becomes mine

31:17.518 --> 31:19.217
when you use your job as a smokescreen

31:19.218 --> 31:21.351
to redirect your guilt onto my family.

31:21.352 --> 31:23.851
So cut it out.

31:29.885 --> 31:32.351
(door opens)

31:32.352 --> 31:34.651
(door closes)

31:48.685 --> 31:50.017
(dial tone buzzes)

31:50.018 --> 31:51.517
(phone speed-dialing)

31:51.518 --> 31:53.818
(line ringing)

31:56.052 --> 31:57.684
HENRY: Hello, you've reached Henry McCord.

31:57.685 --> 31:59.084
Please leave me a message.

31:59.085 --> 32:00.352
(beeps)

32:14.352 --> 32:16.217
There you are.

32:16.218 --> 32:18.584
- Hi.
- Hi.

32:20.785 --> 32:22.748
- What?
- No, no, I just...

32:22.749 --> 32:23.585
What's wrong? You all right?

32:23.586 --> 32:25.584
I thought... I thought
you were at the archives.

32:25.585 --> 32:28.684
Well, it was crowded
and I got hungry, so...

32:30.218 --> 32:31.684
Are you having an affair?

32:33.185 --> 32:35.151
I heard it. I don't believe it.

32:35.152 --> 32:37.684
But I need to hear it from you.

32:38.785 --> 32:41.351
Oh, my God.

32:41.352 --> 32:43.117
No.

32:43.118 --> 32:45.583
Well, you're gonna have

32:45.584 --> 32:47.151
to be a lot more convincing.

32:47.152 --> 32:48.351
Immediately.

32:48.352 --> 32:50.284
Have you completely lost your mind?

32:50.285 --> 32:52.017
Okay, that's better.

32:52.018 --> 32:53.850
But what's going on?

32:53.851 --> 32:55.084
You haven't given me pages...

32:55.085 --> 32:56.684
Pages? I can't even
get you on the phone.

32:56.685 --> 32:57.552
How am I gonna...

32:57.553 --> 32:59.184
Henry, you've published eight books.

32:59.185 --> 33:00.450
I've seen you in writing mode.

33:00.451 --> 33:01.750
You can't stop talking about it.

33:01.751 --> 33:03.850
You're like, "Yak, yak, yak,"
you won't even shut up.

33:03.851 --> 33:05.251
I mean, this is different.

33:05.252 --> 33:06.750
This is... this is weird

33:06.751 --> 33:08.318
and you're being sneaky.

33:08.319 --> 33:10.984
I don't...

33:10.985 --> 33:12.252
Wait...

33:13.218 --> 33:15.618
I know this.

33:16.818 --> 33:19.118
You're working for the NSA again.

33:21.319 --> 33:22.617
Yes.

33:22.618 --> 33:25.583
- That's why you're not at the archives!
- Well, I...

33:25.584 --> 33:26.951
That's why you're being seen

33:26.952 --> 33:28.817
around town with a cute young woman!

33:28.818 --> 33:29.717
She's my handler.

33:29.718 --> 33:30.817
- I added "cute."
- No, she's...

33:30.818 --> 33:31.984
- Is she cute?
- ...my handler.

33:31.985 --> 33:33.555
Okay. But then why didn't

33:33.556 --> 33:34.318
you just tell me?!

33:34.319 --> 33:35.884
I told them it was absurd!

33:35.885 --> 33:37.217
I mean, they let me
tell you the last time!

33:37.218 --> 33:38.583
- Yes!
- But this mission is

33:38.584 --> 33:39.650
so top secret that even

33:39.651 --> 33:42.650
the Secretary of State can't know.

33:42.651 --> 33:44.514
You know, I'm not gonna lie to you.

33:44.515 --> 33:46.684
Well, you better not!

33:46.685 --> 33:49.117
Is it that religious scholar again?

33:49.118 --> 33:50.617
Yes, the investigation has ramped up,

33:50.618 --> 33:52.395
which merits the higher
security clearance...

33:52.396 --> 33:53.651
Can I ask why?

33:54.385 --> 33:55.550
I can

33:55.551 --> 33:57.184
tell you why it has to be me.

33:57.185 --> 33:59.550
I'm the only person who
can viably walk up to him

33:59.551 --> 34:01.463
at academic conferences.

34:03.085 --> 34:05.483
I-I... I gue... I guess
you had to say yes.

34:05.484 --> 34:06.517
I can still say no.

34:06.518 --> 34:09.251
Of course you can't.

34:09.252 --> 34:11.551
Mwah!

34:20.275 --> 34:21.342
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:21.342 --> 34:22.576
Uh, I was just headed to you.

34:22.577 --> 34:23.954
What's that?

34:23.955 --> 34:26.754
A speech that should
shake up the standoff.

34:26.755 --> 34:28.380
Are there any metaphors?

34:28.380 --> 34:30.045
I'm kind of off metaphors for a while.

34:30.047 --> 34:32.079
Uh, Saigal needs to push around the U.S.

34:32.080 --> 34:34.480
- before accepting its aid, right?
- Unfortunately, yes.

34:34.481 --> 34:36.879
Okay, so forget a Hepanza apology.

34:36.880 --> 34:38.179
Do him one better.

34:38.181 --> 34:40.712
You take the blame for the spill.

34:40.713 --> 34:43.933
You said you felt responsible
for being at the plant.

34:43.934 --> 34:45.931
The media's already
implying that you are.

34:45.933 --> 34:46.998
Thanks for reminding me.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.398
So, fall on that sword.

34:48.399 --> 34:50.831
It's already sharpened.

34:50.833 --> 34:53.130
What exactly am I apologizing for?

34:53.132 --> 34:56.130
"For visiting the plant
without investigating the scope

34:56.132 --> 34:59.532
and disparity of U.S. and
Indian industrial standards."

34:59.533 --> 35:02.498
"Had I done so, I would have urged

35:02.499 --> 35:04.198
"both countries to raise their standards

35:04.199 --> 35:06.832
for the sake of all their citizens."

35:06.833 --> 35:08.045
- Bingo.
- Sure.

35:08.046 --> 35:11.000
But Hepanza still gets to
hide behind MIP standards.

35:11.001 --> 35:13.899
Aren't I just pulling
India's pants down?

35:13.900 --> 35:16.365
They might not care if they
can play your mea culpa

35:16.366 --> 35:18.098
- ad nauseam.
- And if they do?

35:18.099 --> 35:19.699
You take this hit.

35:19.700 --> 35:21.398
You've got people's
attention long enough

35:21.399 --> 35:24.599
to tell them that India is
blocking American aid.

35:24.600 --> 35:27.198
Now they're in the court
of public opinion.

35:27.199 --> 35:30.033
With no choice but to
demand the Hotshots.

35:31.067 --> 35:33.498
At the very least, it'll
disrupt the news cycle.

35:33.499 --> 35:36.066
And it re-frames my visit
to the Hepanza plant.

35:36.067 --> 35:37.032
Which doesn't hurt.

35:37.033 --> 35:38.699
Okay!

35:38.700 --> 35:40.098
I'm on the merry-go-round.

35:40.099 --> 35:41.642
We got to run this by POTUS.

35:41.643 --> 35:44.365
This is a serious swing.

35:44.366 --> 35:45.432
Good work, Matt.

35:45.433 --> 35:47.865
Really. Wow.

35:47.866 --> 35:49.865
Oh, and, uh, that factory speech

35:49.866 --> 35:51.688
that Scott wrote,
linking you to the spill.

35:51.689 --> 35:53.999
- I never vetted it...
- No, d-d-don't, don't push it.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.398
<i>Okay, so, CNN India</i>

35:55.399 --> 35:57.732
and the BBC are front and center.

35:57.733 --> 35:59.799
I want them to get a good
shot of this apology.

35:59.800 --> 36:02.198
- Already done.
- Oh, and the <i>Hindustan Free Press.</i>

36:02.199 --> 36:04.332
- They're in the front row?
- Yes, but they're not TV.

36:04.333 --> 36:07.165
Well, it's personal.

36:07.166 --> 36:08.632
- Madam Secretary?
- Yeah?

36:08.633 --> 36:09.999
Regarding our discussion earlier.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.265
I was unprofessional.

36:11.266 --> 36:12.732
But I have a handle on it now.

36:12.733 --> 36:13.765
It won't happen again.

36:13.766 --> 36:15.732
Good.

36:15.733 --> 36:18.799
Because I'm going to need your
magic to survive Matt's speech.

36:18.800 --> 36:21.100
You've got it.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.165
NADINE: The Secretary of State.

36:24.166 --> 36:27.432
ELIZABETH: Thank you, ladies
and gentlemen, for coming.

36:27.433 --> 36:31.131
I'm here today to take responsibility

36:31.132 --> 36:33.398
for the severe chemical spill

36:33.399 --> 36:35.932
that has devastated the Ganges

36:35.933 --> 36:38.933
and the United States'
relationship with India.

36:40.099 --> 36:41.932
That was a hell of a speech, Bess.

36:41.933 --> 36:43.699
Ah, throwing yourself,

36:43.700 --> 36:46.165
the Indian government and
Hepanza under the bus?

36:46.166 --> 36:49.432
I barely felt the wheels pass over me.

36:49.433 --> 36:51.032
Thanks for seeing the potential.

36:51.033 --> 36:53.129
Your blessing was crucial.

36:53.130 --> 36:54.733
The Indians nearly crashed Twitter,

36:54.734 --> 36:56.131
demanding the Texas Hotshots.

36:56.132 --> 36:58.632
#BringTheCowboysToTheIndians.

36:58.633 --> 37:00.460
That would be the work
of my press secretary.

37:00.461 --> 37:03.633
So, they let the Hotshots
into the spill site. What now?

37:03.634 --> 37:04.932
Fire's under control.

37:04.933 --> 37:06.231
The leak's close to being plugged.

37:06.232 --> 37:07.865
The worst is contained.

37:07.866 --> 37:09.165
And Saigal?

37:09.166 --> 37:10.999
Well, he's already seized on my apology

37:11.000 --> 37:12.632
as proof of India's might.

37:12.633 --> 37:14.999
He says that's why he let our aid in.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.066
So, he's having all our best ideas.

37:17.067 --> 37:18.758
- And Ted?
- Well, as I'm sure you know,

37:18.759 --> 37:19.933
Hepanza's stock's been

37:19.934 --> 37:21.732
in free fall since the spill.

37:21.733 --> 37:25.131
Your speech snipped the
ripcord from their parachute.

37:25.132 --> 37:27.365
His board called an emergency meeting.

37:27.366 --> 37:29.498
Ted resigned shortly after.

37:29.499 --> 37:31.398
In his statement, he
admitted that the optics

37:31.399 --> 37:33.066
of staying on as CEO

37:33.067 --> 37:34.699
didn't look good for the company.

37:34.700 --> 37:36.498
DALTON: He always lands on his feet.

37:36.499 --> 37:38.865
Russell's over the moon.

37:38.866 --> 37:39.966
He didn't like me taking

37:39.967 --> 37:42.465
anyone's advice over his.

37:42.466 --> 37:44.833
Your words, Mr. President.

37:50.099 --> 37:52.565
Hey. You're up late.

37:52.566 --> 37:54.766
You still texting with Sanjay?

37:55.600 --> 37:57.465
I don't know.

37:57.466 --> 38:00.198
It's like I'm saying
all the right things.

38:00.199 --> 38:03.032
It's just, I got to come
home to my cozy house.

38:03.033 --> 38:05.932
And he's still suffering in India.

38:05.933 --> 38:08.565
Well... I get it.

38:08.566 --> 38:09.532
It's tough.

38:09.533 --> 38:11.799
Seriously, Dad? That's it?

38:11.800 --> 38:13.565
Well, look, honey,

38:13.566 --> 38:15.665
sometimes when terrible things happen,

38:15.666 --> 38:17.865
it's enough just to be there
and to say you're sorry.

38:17.866 --> 38:19.231
I'm having nightmares.

38:19.232 --> 38:20.398
Because I got to come home.

38:20.399 --> 38:23.432
And that makes me feel guilty.

38:23.433 --> 38:25.098
He's with his family?

38:25.099 --> 38:27.131
They're all okay?

38:27.132 --> 38:28.565
Yeah.

38:28.566 --> 38:31.067
He's home, too.

38:33.399 --> 38:36.433
(knocking)

38:38.900 --> 38:40.465
(panting)

38:40.466 --> 38:42.098
What?

38:42.099 --> 38:44.966
Your text said it was an emergency.

38:44.967 --> 38:47.098
Wait, did you run all the way here?

38:47.099 --> 38:48.599
No, no, I'm just,

38:48.600 --> 38:50.465
I'm just, I'm extremely out of shape.

38:50.466 --> 38:52.265
Is everything okay?

38:52.266 --> 38:55.066
I came home today

38:55.067 --> 38:57.632
after the speech of my life

38:57.633 --> 38:59.699
and I got super depressed

38:59.700 --> 39:01.465
when I realized the only person

39:01.466 --> 39:03.465
I had to share it with was Gross Tony.

39:03.466 --> 39:06.165
So, you're here because
you hate your roommate?

39:06.166 --> 39:07.865
(laughs)

39:07.866 --> 39:09.732
I can't get a drink tonight.

39:09.733 --> 39:12.665
I'm not here for a drink.

39:12.666 --> 39:14.532
I'm here because until today,

39:14.533 --> 39:16.432
I've lived my entire life

39:16.433 --> 39:18.465
doing things because they're easy.

39:18.466 --> 39:20.432
School, jobs,

39:20.433 --> 39:21.632
girls.

39:21.633 --> 39:22.999
Not you.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.832
You're opinionated.

39:25.833 --> 39:28.532
And strong and you're sharp.

39:28.533 --> 39:30.765
You're so sharp.

39:30.766 --> 39:33.432
I mean, it scares the crap out
of me how sharp you are.

39:33.433 --> 39:35.098
And then that scares
the crap out of me,

39:35.099 --> 39:37.131
which is why I joke.

39:37.132 --> 39:39.032
And I pretend like I'm
just messing with you.

39:39.033 --> 39:41.565
When really, I want
to be serious about you.

39:41.566 --> 39:43.465
Serious enough

39:43.466 --> 39:46.599
to say the most sincere, awkward,

39:46.600 --> 39:48.732
weird thing one human

39:48.733 --> 39:51.599
can say to another, which is...

39:51.600 --> 39:53.599
What's wrong? Is this not working?

39:53.600 --> 39:55.365
I had a nightmare about this.

39:55.366 --> 39:58.999
Win proposed to me tonight.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.833
I said yes.

40:08.433 --> 40:10.599
Is he here right now?

40:13.433 --> 40:15.966
Oh, God, this is worse
than the nightmare.

40:15.967 --> 40:18.098
I'm sorry. I mean,

40:18.099 --> 40:20.932
I'm not sorry. I'm happy.

40:20.933 --> 40:22.398
I just...

40:22.399 --> 40:23.599
feel bad for you.

40:23.600 --> 40:26.332
No, don't, don't. No. I'll be fine.

40:33.900 --> 40:36.499
Congratulations.

40:40.399 --> 40:42.231
Is that something I can ask about

40:42.232 --> 40:44.032
or not?

40:44.033 --> 40:45.899
No, it's actually my book.

40:45.900 --> 40:48.199
I was able to get back to it today.

40:50.633 --> 40:54.532
Did they actually move
up your deadline?

40:54.533 --> 40:55.899
No.

40:55.900 --> 40:57.366
I'm sorry about that.

40:59.700 --> 41:02.699
Well, now that I sort of
know what you're doing,

41:02.700 --> 41:05.265
how much can I know
about what you're doing?

41:05.266 --> 41:07.765
How much do you want to know?

41:07.766 --> 41:10.167
Not much.

41:11.266 --> 41:13.799
This can work, right?

41:13.800 --> 41:15.832
You and the NSA?

41:15.833 --> 41:18.066
We'll give it a shot.

41:18.067 --> 41:20.379
If it doesn't work, they can
find another brilliant religious

41:20.380 --> 41:23.232
scholar who's married to someone
in the presidential cabinet.

41:29.166 --> 41:31.265
Hey.

41:31.266 --> 41:32.832
It's the life we signed up for, right?

41:32.833 --> 41:34.932
You're right.

41:34.933 --> 41:37.332
We'll figure it out eventually.

41:37.333 --> 41:40.433
We will, right?

41:42.766 --> 41:44.133
Oh.

41:45.299 --> 41:48.066
What are we gonna do about Stevie?

41:48.067 --> 41:49.298
That's it, I can't stand the thought

41:49.299 --> 41:50.599
of her thinking I would cheat on you.

41:50.600 --> 41:53.298
I know, but now there's
something bigger at stake.

41:53.299 --> 41:55.466
I-I've got to go talk to her.

41:57.433 --> 42:00.299
I think she needs to hear it from me.

42:01.333 --> 42:03.599
(footsteps approaching)

42:12.533 --> 42:14.665
Your father is not having an affair.

42:14.666 --> 42:16.732
So, what did he tell you?

42:16.733 --> 42:18.398
She's a grad student, right?

42:18.399 --> 42:20.265
Honestly, Mom,

42:20.266 --> 42:21.498
how naive are you?

42:21.499 --> 42:24.632
If you enjoy your privacy
as much as you claim,

42:24.633 --> 42:27.699
then please respect ours.

42:27.700 --> 42:29.565
Besides, Stevie,

42:29.566 --> 42:31.532
if I really thought
your dad was cheating,

42:31.533 --> 42:33.665
do you think he'd still be breathing?

42:33.666 --> 42:34.697
Let alone living here?

42:34.698 --> 42:36.701
Maybe you're not interpreting
things correctly.

42:36.702 --> 42:40.265
I was a CIA analyst.

42:40.266 --> 42:42.699
You're entitled to your judgments.

42:42.700 --> 42:44.999
But not to explanations.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.532
And you're grounded for
being 20 and drunk in a bar.

42:47.533 --> 42:49.066
Yes, Daisy told me.

42:49.067 --> 42:50.598
Under great duress by the way.

42:50.599 --> 42:52.565
You can't ground me. I have to work.

42:52.566 --> 42:54.365
- Work and home. Two weeks.
- This is ridiculous.

42:54.366 --> 42:55.532
I'm an adult.

42:55.533 --> 42:57.599
I guess that's why most adults

42:57.600 --> 43:00.866
don't live with their parents.

43:03.600 --> 43:05.033
Mom?

43:07.766 --> 43:10.432
I'm really glad about Dad.

43:10.433 --> 43:14.265
It was horrible.

43:14.266 --> 43:16.665
I am really sorry

43:16.666 --> 43:19.100
you had to go through that.

43:25.232 --> 43:27.900
You're still grounded.
