Well, there is some good news.

20:33.928 --> 20:35.451
Pedro isn't
on deportation records.

20:35.756 --> 20:37.584
I checked Customs
and Border Patrol servers.

20:37.627 --> 20:38.933
Nothing.

20:39.281 --> 20:40.108
He must still be in the country.

20:40.413 --> 20:41.718
You're a quick study.

20:42.023 --> 20:44.417
Yeah, Harry's instructions
were mind-numbingly detailed.

20:44.765 --> 20:47.420
Hey, you okay doing this
right now?

20:48.377 --> 20:49.683
Yeah.

20:49.726 --> 20:51.467
I mean...

20:51.772 --> 20:53.904
what else am I gonna do?

20:53.948 --> 20:55.602
He's not dead, right?

20:55.906 --> 20:57.212
We'll figure something out.

20:57.517 --> 20:59.214
Yeah. We will.

20:59.519 --> 21:01.651
Well, then, in the meantime,

21:01.912 --> 21:04.088
there's a little boy
out there lost, so...

21:04.393 --> 21:05.699
we have to find him.

21:06.003 --> 21:07.918
If he hasn't been deported,
he must be in the foster system.

21:08.441 --> 21:10.573
Dante identified
half a dozen agencies

21:10.878 --> 21:12.575
that work
with Crestfield's Home.

21:12.880 --> 21:15.186
He and I are going
to canvass them now.

21:15.491 --> 21:16.187
I'll stop back after?

21:16.492 --> 21:18.277
Thanks, Rob. Love ya.

21:18.625 --> 21:20.191
[chuckles] You, too.

21:20.496 --> 21:21.280
[call beeps off]

21:21.628 --> 21:23.934
[door opens]We're closed!

21:23.978 --> 21:26.154
Yeah, I know.

21:26.459 --> 21:28.374
I got to talkto you.

21:32.987 --> 21:34.597
You don't like me, do you?

21:38.340 --> 21:40.081
Yeah. Well,
what I'm about to tell you

21:40.386 --> 21:41.648
isn't gonna change that.

21:41.996 --> 21:45.304
I've done everything
I can think of,

21:45.608 --> 21:47.088
and I can't get him out.

21:47.393 --> 21:49.220
But there is a path

21:49.525 --> 21:51.048
if he would choose it.

21:51.571 --> 21:54.487
You want him to go back
to Military Intelligence?I am confident

21:54.835 --> 21:56.793
that if he would do that...

21:56.837 --> 21:57.925
He won't.

21:58.926 --> 22:00.101
Then convince him.

22:01.668 --> 22:04.148
To be someone he's not?

22:04.453 --> 22:06.325
To go against
every fiber

22:06.629 --> 22:09.240
of his moral being
because it's convenient?

22:09.545 --> 22:10.677
Mel, this is his last shot.

22:10.981 --> 22:12.548
All this
martyrdom stuff,

22:12.853 --> 22:14.681
"values his soul
over his freedom."

22:14.985 --> 22:16.422
I don't even know
what that means.

22:16.726 --> 22:18.815
It's foolish.Don't.

22:18.859 --> 22:20.469
It's not foolish.

22:20.774 --> 22:22.210
Not to him.

22:22.515 --> 22:23.907
It's who he is.
It's the reason

22:24.430 --> 22:28.129
why he took the risk to help you
in the first place.

22:30.087 --> 22:32.699
It's why I love him.

22:33.003 --> 22:35.049
Well, I wish I could help him,
but I can't.

22:35.397 --> 22:36.920
I'm sorry.

22:36.964 --> 22:38.357
Yeah.

22:38.661 --> 22:40.141
Me, too.

22:44.624 --> 22:46.016
[phone ringing]

22:48.062 --> 22:49.368
Hola.

22:49.890 --> 22:52.022
Ms. Castillo, this is Nate
from Crestfield's Group Home.

22:52.545 --> 22:54.460
Yes, yes.
Uh, did you find Pedro's file?

22:54.764 --> 22:56.592
Do you know where he is?

22:56.897 --> 22:59.465
I do, and I can take you
to him, but...

22:59.769 --> 23:01.554
I could lose my job here.

23:01.771 --> 23:04.426
Please. I have to find him.

23:04.731 --> 23:06.472
I won't tell anyone.

23:06.776 --> 23:08.387
I need you to promise
not to tell.

23:08.691 --> 23:10.084
Not even your friend.

23:11.085 --> 23:12.086
I promise.

23:12.434 --> 23:13.435
Good.

23:13.740 --> 23:15.742
I'll explain everything
when I see you.

23:15.785 --> 23:17.004
Okay.

23:17.047 --> 23:18.962
Where do I meet you?

23:23.097 --> 23:24.620
Ms. Castillo?

23:24.925 --> 23:27.318
Why bring me here?
And where is my s...

23:27.623 --> 23:29.538
[gasps]
Keep quiet.

23:29.843 --> 23:31.584
Walk to that car
over there.

23:34.891 --> 23:37.154
[grunting]

23:38.678 --> 23:40.767
Did you really think she'd be
stupid enough to come alone?

23:41.071 --> 23:42.159
Wait. I wasn't gonna hurt her.Oh, yeah?

23:42.682 --> 23:44.901
Then why'd you bring the gun?
Where's the boy?

23:44.945 --> 23:46.468
I don't know.

23:47.600 --> 23:49.515
This is not the day.
Where is the boy?

23:49.819 --> 23:51.342
Okay. Look,
I can take you to him.

23:51.647 --> 23:53.562
He's safe. I swear.

23:54.607 --> 23:55.651
Give me the address.

23:55.956 --> 23:58.785
Okay, okay. Uh, 1137 Bedford.

23:59.133 --> 24:00.656
You're gonna take us to him
right now.

24:00.961 --> 24:02.179
Get up. Get up.

24:04.138 --> 24:05.444
[gunshots, Nate grunts]MEL:
Down. Down.

24:05.748 --> 24:07.533
[tires squealing]

24:10.057 --> 24:11.972
[screams]

24:14.496 --> 24:16.455
[vehicle approaching]

24:16.803 --> 24:17.543
[car door opens]

24:17.847 --> 24:19.545
[door closes]

24:19.849 --> 24:21.721
ROBYN:
Mel? Alma?

24:22.678 --> 24:23.810
What happened?

24:24.114 --> 24:25.376
Shooter took him out
and tore off that way.

24:25.681 --> 24:26.595
You get a look at him?

24:26.900 --> 24:28.118
Just taillights.Thanks for covering.

24:28.641 --> 24:30.469
Good thing I was close
by or she'd be dead.

24:30.773 --> 24:31.948
Any luck in Long Island?

24:31.992 --> 24:32.819
Struck out.

24:33.167 --> 24:34.647
Which means he's our best lead.

24:34.995 --> 24:36.126
I'm beginningto see

24:36.649 --> 24:37.737
why you two are friends.
MEL:
It was a setup.

24:38.041 --> 24:39.826
He pulled a gun on her
the minute she showed.

24:40.130 --> 24:41.305
And when it went sideways,

24:41.828 --> 24:43.133
his partner wanted
to make sure he didn't talk.

24:43.656 --> 24:45.048
DANTE:If they were trying
to make her disappear,

24:45.571 --> 24:47.442
this is a whole lot bigger
than just a missing kid.

24:47.747 --> 24:48.965
ALMA:
Why did they kill him?

24:49.270 --> 24:51.664
Because he told us
where my son is?

24:51.968 --> 24:53.056
MEL:
He gave an address.

24:53.579 --> 24:55.189
1137 Bedford.
He said the kid was there.

24:55.537 --> 24:56.190
[siren approaching]

24:56.538 --> 24:57.496
We should get out of here.

24:57.844 --> 24:58.540
I'll leave
the mother out

24:58.845 --> 24:59.585
of the report for now.

24:59.889 --> 25:00.847
But I'll need you to fill me in.

25:01.151 --> 25:02.457
I'll be fine. Go to the address.

25:02.762 --> 25:04.807
[doorbell rings]Find her son.

25:05.808 --> 25:06.592
Yes?

25:06.896 --> 25:09.203
Is there a Pedro Castillo here?

25:10.204 --> 25:12.380
Who's asking?

25:12.685 --> 25:15.078
I'm his mother.

25:16.993 --> 25:19.343
I don't understand-- Pedro said
his parents were killed.

25:19.648 --> 25:20.867
The agency confirmed it.

25:21.171 --> 25:23.304
We... we just adopted him.

25:23.826 --> 25:26.089
You can't adopt my child.MRS. HOBSON:
The consultant

25:26.612 --> 25:28.439
we're working with finalized
the paperwork last week.

25:28.744 --> 25:30.398
Is this the consultant?

25:30.703 --> 25:32.139
Yeah.

25:33.183 --> 25:34.707
How much did you pay him?

25:35.011 --> 25:37.187
Ten thousand dollars.

25:37.710 --> 25:39.276
He works data entry at
a children's shelter.

25:39.799 --> 25:42.236
I think he's part
of an illegal adoption ring.

25:42.279 --> 25:43.411
No. You're lying.

25:43.933 --> 25:45.152
Gail...No. A stranger shows up
at our doorstep,

25:45.674 --> 25:47.415
and we're just supposed
to hand Pedro over?

25:47.720 --> 25:48.851
Show me a birth
certificate

25:49.156 --> 25:50.244
or a passport.We don't need you
to hand him over.

25:50.766 --> 25:53.073
We just want to speak
with him.Mm-mm.

25:53.595 --> 25:54.901
No. I want them
out of my house.

25:55.205 --> 25:56.859
I'm not leaving
without my son.Alma...

25:57.164 --> 25:58.382
Mr. and Mrs. Hobson, please.

25:58.687 --> 26:00.036
Either you
bring Pedro out now,

26:00.341 --> 26:03.344
or we call Social Services,
let them sort it out.

26:03.649 --> 26:04.911
I'll get him.N-No.

26:05.215 --> 26:06.913
Gail, honey...No. No.

26:07.957 --> 26:09.350
If she really is
Pedro's mother,

26:09.872 --> 26:12.353
what kind of people are we
if we take him away from her?

26:12.658 --> 26:14.616
It's okay.

26:32.765 --> 26:34.767
That's not him.

26:35.071 --> 26:36.943
That's not my Pedro.

26:57.137 --> 26:58.399
It's okay.

26:59.835 --> 27:02.664
Manny Emmanuel Garcia.

27:03.665 --> 27:04.492
Sweetie,

27:04.840 --> 27:06.320
why did you pretend
to be Pedro?

27:06.668 --> 27:07.669
He asked me to.

27:07.974 --> 27:09.976
He heard they were going
to find a home for him,

27:10.324 --> 27:12.065
and he was afraid if he went,

27:12.369 --> 27:14.633
his mami
wouldn't be able to find him.

27:14.981 --> 27:16.722
But I wanted a home,

27:17.026 --> 27:18.637
so we switched names.

27:18.941 --> 27:19.638
[sniffles softly]

27:19.986 --> 27:21.640
That sounds like my Pedro-ito.

27:21.988 --> 27:25.382
The story you told
us about the storm

27:25.687 --> 27:27.646
and the rest of
your family,

27:27.950 --> 27:29.691
was that true?

27:30.736 --> 27:33.303
My family...

27:33.347 --> 27:35.305
they're gone.

27:36.350 --> 27:38.221
[sighs]

27:47.753 --> 27:50.016
Will I have to leave now?

27:50.364 --> 27:53.672
No. No. You're our son.

27:53.976 --> 27:55.282
We love you.

27:55.804 --> 27:58.067
MR. HUDSON:
We're gonna fight
to keep you. Huh?

28:00.722 --> 28:03.072
I hope you find your boy.

28:06.989 --> 28:08.599
[door opens, closes]

28:08.904 --> 28:10.863
I thought
I'd finally found him.

28:11.211 --> 28:12.995
Hey, we'll keep at it.

28:13.300 --> 28:15.694
We'll go back to the group home,
and we'll find "Emmanuel."

28:16.042 --> 28:17.652
I went room to room.

28:17.957 --> 28:19.045
Then we'll keep looking.

28:20.220 --> 28:22.222
[phone ringing]

28:26.226 --> 28:28.445
[quietly]:
Please tell me something good.

28:28.489 --> 28:29.751
Wish I could.

28:30.273 --> 28:32.275
There is no Emmanuel Garcia
at the group home anymore,

28:32.798 --> 28:35.017
and any record of him was lost
in that data purge.

28:35.322 --> 28:37.063
I'm circling back
with foster agencies

28:37.411 --> 28:39.892
and OCFS, but... nothing so far.

28:40.196 --> 28:41.589
What about our data entry clerk?

28:41.894 --> 28:42.938
His apartment was ransacked.

28:43.243 --> 28:45.332
I'm thinking
whoever he was working with

28:45.375 --> 28:46.942
got to it before we did.

28:47.247 --> 28:49.728
Yeah, most likely partners
in the adoption ring.

28:50.032 --> 28:51.207
[sighs]

28:51.512 --> 28:53.775
God knows how many kids
they've already sold off.

28:54.080 --> 28:56.256
And with no records...

28:56.778 --> 28:58.693
we have no way
of finding any of them.

28:58.998 --> 29:00.303
Wish I had more.

29:00.347 --> 29:01.348
Yeah.

29:01.391 --> 29:03.089
Me, too.

29:05.874 --> 29:07.746
[sighs]

29:08.790 --> 29:10.618
Must have been terrible for Alma

29:10.966 --> 29:12.272
to think she found her son.

29:12.794 --> 29:15.362
Sad part is, I know Harry
could probably restore that data

29:15.405 --> 29:16.798
and find those kids.

29:17.103 --> 29:19.105
I don't care what Bishop said,

29:19.453 --> 29:21.498
we're not giving up just yet.

29:21.542 --> 29:22.630
Look...

29:23.152 --> 29:25.938
I know Bishop didn't start
with General Ryland.

29:27.809 --> 29:30.464
And I know you've done
everything you can.

29:35.251 --> 29:37.514
How did we run out
of options, Rob?

29:38.951 --> 29:40.953
We're never out of options.

29:43.129 --> 29:44.652
[sighs]

29:44.957 --> 29:47.263
[siren wailing in distance]

29:51.311 --> 29:53.313
Aunt Vi? I thought
you left already.

29:53.835 --> 29:56.795
I can't leave until I find the
keys to my art storage cabinet.

29:57.099 --> 29:58.187
[closes drawer]

29:58.492 --> 30:00.407
[sighs] The pieces
I'm supposed to be showing

30:00.929 --> 30:02.757
for this damn art festival
are in there.

30:03.062 --> 30:04.759
Well, I can pop
that open for you.

30:05.064 --> 30:06.108
[sighs]

30:06.413 --> 30:08.502
You got home late last night.

30:09.546 --> 30:11.374
Heard you banging
around the kitchen.

30:11.418 --> 30:12.723
Couldn't sleep?

30:13.028 --> 30:15.248
Sorry,
I didn't mean to wake you.

30:16.205 --> 30:18.338
Want to talk about it?

30:24.344 --> 30:26.476
I solve people's problems.

30:26.520 --> 30:28.217
It's what I'm good at.

30:28.522 --> 30:31.220
But right now, I have
a close friend who I can't help

30:31.525 --> 30:34.833
and a lost child I can't find.

30:37.009 --> 30:38.227
[sighs]

30:39.272 --> 30:40.926
I don't like feeling like this.

30:41.230 --> 30:42.536
It feels like I'm...

30:42.884 --> 30:43.885
Powerless?

30:44.190 --> 30:46.583
Honey, that just means
that you're human.

30:46.627 --> 30:48.324
You have been fighting

30:48.629 --> 30:51.719
ever since you let out
that righteous cry

30:52.067 --> 30:53.721
the day you were born.

30:54.069 --> 30:55.810
And you usually win.

30:56.115 --> 30:58.291
Not this time, Auntie.

30:59.553 --> 31:01.990

Hola.Manny,

32:04.183 --> 32:06.533
the day you left Crestfield's
Group for your new home,

32:06.576 --> 32:07.795
who walked you out?

32:08.100 --> 32:09.144
Some man.

32:09.449 --> 32:11.016
Do you remember
what he looked like?

32:11.320 --> 32:12.931
He had hair on his face.

32:13.235 --> 32:14.933
Did he have a badge?

32:15.281 --> 32:17.109
A gun, too.

32:17.413 --> 32:19.981
What color was his uniform?

32:21.026 --> 32:21.940

He was describing an ICE agent.

32:25.160 --> 32:27.032
There's no way Pedro could have
walked out of that group home

32:27.336 --> 32:28.729
by himself.

32:29.034 --> 32:30.122
He had to be escorted out.

32:30.426 --> 32:31.601
And Yardley didn't have
the authority.

32:32.124 --> 32:33.299
But an ICE agent does.And I'm willing

32:33.647 --> 32:35.301
to bet that he's
Yardley's partner.

32:35.605 --> 32:36.737

that description

I think I found him.

32:40.349 --> 32:43.135
Agent Ike Deleo.

32:43.483 --> 32:44.832
That's him.Crestfield's Group Home

32:45.137 --> 32:46.181
is in his jurisdiction.

32:46.486 --> 32:47.966
All he'd have to do
is produce papers

32:48.314 --> 32:49.576

a second thought.

32:52.187 --> 32:54.885
Then he could just walk out
with a kid, no questions asked.

32:55.408 --> 32:58.324
Okay. So how do we figure out
where Deleo took Pedro?

32:58.628 --> 32:59.847
