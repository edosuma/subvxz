      Hey, Ma,                  

00:53.987 --> 00:56.788
you think Daddy's gonna like    
his surprise birthday party?    

00:56.790 --> 00:58.790
Oh, yeah,                       
he's gonna love it.             

00:58.792 --> 01:01.292
        How can you be so sure  
     he'll like being surprised?

01:01.294 --> 01:03.028
Oh, he told me.                 

01:04.163 --> 01:05.163
                         Huh?   

01:05.165 --> 01:06.564
     When did he say that?      

01:06.566 --> 01:09.034
Yesterday morning               
when I asked him.               

01:09.036 --> 01:12.671
That-- That means that Daddy    
 knows about his birthday party.

01:12.673 --> 01:16.007
Yeah, it's safer that way.      

01:16.009 --> 01:18.810
    Look at the time!           
        It's 10 after 5.        

01:18.812 --> 01:21.612
    The guests will be here     
         in 20 minutes!         

01:21.614 --> 01:22.613
                 Twenty minutes?

01:22.615 --> 01:25.183
Yeah. I told them               
to come at 5:30.                

01:25.185 --> 01:28.687
That way we'll be ready         
to shout "Surprise!" at Archie  

01:28.689 --> 01:30.321
when he gets home at 6.         

01:30.323 --> 01:31.489
Oh. We'd better get ready.      

01:31.491 --> 01:33.457
                    Oh!         
    Hi, everybody!              

01:33.459 --> 01:34.759
                    How are you?
Wow!                            

01:34.761 --> 01:36.661
Well, here's Archie's           
     birthday present.          

01:36.663 --> 01:38.362
                  Thank you,    
                Louise.         

01:38.364 --> 01:40.031
What a beautiful box!           

01:40.033 --> 01:41.632
What did you                    
get him, Louise?                

01:41.634 --> 01:44.035
         Oh, it's not my present
        to Archie. It's Edith's.

01:44.037 --> 01:46.838
Yeah, Louise kept it            
 over at her house              

01:46.840 --> 01:49.207
so Archie wouldn't find out     
    what it was.                

01:49.209 --> 01:50.875
              What is it, Edith?

01:50.877 --> 01:53.578
Oh, I can't tell you.           
It's a secret.                  

01:53.580 --> 01:57.115
But it's something              
Archie has always wanted.       

01:57.117 --> 02:01.152
        Well, it's too big      
    to be a brain transplant.   

02:01.154 --> 02:03.788
Oh, Mike!                       

02:03.790 --> 02:05.190
                Well, I've got  
             to be getting back.

02:06.392 --> 02:08.459

         over at my house first.

Justin Quigley and Jo           
 are already there.             

02:10.197 --> 02:11.329
        Oh! Right.              

02:11.331 --> 02:12.864
            Who's Justin Quigley
                and Jo?         

02:12.866 --> 02:14.365
              Oh, honey,        
          don't you remember?   

02:14.367 --> 02:16.267
They're our new grandparents.   
          We adopted them.      

02:16.269 --> 02:17.668
            Oh, that's right!   

02:17.670 --> 02:19.037
    The old man that Ma found   

02:19.039 --> 02:20.638
    walking around the street   
            in his pajamas.     

02:20.640 --> 02:21.639
Yeah.                           

02:21.641 --> 02:22.707
    Well, I'm taking off.       

02:22.709 --> 02:23.908
Wait a minute,                  
Louise!                         

02:23.910 --> 02:26.911
Would you mind taking           
that off, please, Mike?         

02:26.913 --> 02:28.512
I want you to look at the cake. 

02:28.514 --> 02:29.781
There! What do you think?       

02:29.783 --> 02:31.582
    It's beautiful.

Frank Lorenzo iced it for me.   

02:34.387 --> 02:37.622
"Happy 50th birthday,           
          Archie."              

02:37.624 --> 02:40.158
I made up the words myself.     

02:41.293 --> 02:42.761
                        Nice.   

02:42.763 --> 02:45.029
                Well, save me   
             a big piece, Edith.

02:45.031 --> 02:49.134

02:54.640 --> 02:57.175
    I better hide this          
         in the closet.         

02:57.177 --> 02:58.276
            Yeah, good idea.    
Yeah.

                      ARCHIE:   
                  Wait a minute!

03:03.616 --> 03:06.384
         Wait a minute!         
Where are you going, huh?       

03:06.386 --> 03:08.119
Daddy, we didn't                
expect you home so soon.        

03:08.121 --> 03:09.620
      Yeah, it's only 10 past 5.

03:09.622 --> 03:10.789
    Oh, look at this.           

03:10.791 --> 03:14.292

         to tell time.

Here I am, Archie!              

03:20.465 --> 03:23.902
        You come running at me  
      like you was a linebacker.

03:23.904 --> 03:24.969
I'm sorry.                      

03:24.971 --> 03:26.504
             What kind of       
          a greeting's that?    

03:26.506 --> 03:29.573
[SWEETLY]                       
Oh, hello, Archie.              

03:29.575 --> 03:32.443
But you ain't supposed          
to be here 'til 6.              

03:32.445 --> 03:33.845
        All right, so I'm early.
                So what?        

03:33.847 --> 03:37.348
Oh, I told everybody            
to come at 5:30                 

03:37.350 --> 03:39.184
so they could surprise you.     

03:39.186 --> 03:43.254
And you promised you wouldn't   
come 'til 6 to be surprised.    

03:43.256 --> 03:45.423
How can we surprise you         
when you're here?               

03:45.425 --> 03:49.660
You broke your promise          
to be surprised.                

03:49.662 --> 03:53.064
      I didn't break my promise.
         It was an act of God.  

03:53.066 --> 03:54.966
                 An act of God? 

03:54.968 --> 03:57.768
                 That's right,  
            you atheist, you!   

03:57.770 --> 04:01.039
     We shut down early today   
  because there was a power cut.

04:01.041 --> 04:02.273
Oh, well, then,                 
that wasn't God.                

04:02.275 --> 04:04.008
That was an act                 
of Con Edison.                  

04:05.177 --> 04:07.645
     Well, who do you think     
        runs Con Edison?        

04:08.780 --> 04:10.681
You're not                      
gonna say God.                  

04:10.683 --> 04:12.116
Well, certainly, little girl.   

04:12.118 --> 04:14.118
    If you knew your Bible,     
        you'd know that.        

04:14.120 --> 04:15.553
God said, "Let there be light," 

04:15.555 --> 04:18.422
        and told Edison         
      to invent the bulb.       

04:20.591 --> 04:23.427
God's in charge of all the power
         in this world.         

04:23.429 --> 04:24.729
    Well, then, you're saying   

04:24.731 --> 04:26.231
          God's responsible for 
         the fuel crisis, right?

04:26.233 --> 04:29.500
  No, stupid! That's your Arabs.

04:33.438 --> 04:36.975
Ain't God in charge             
of them too?                    

04:36.977 --> 04:38.276
                  No!           

04:38.278 --> 04:40.144
     That's your Muhammad.      

04:41.446 --> 04:43.614
Muhammad's been in charge       
          of the Arabs          

04:43.616 --> 04:47.218
ever since God traded them      
  to Muhammad for a mountain.   

04:49.321 --> 04:52.790
I didn't think it could be done,
     but you did it, Arch.      

04:52.792 --> 04:55.126
        You just killed         
    the <i>Living Bible.</i>           

04:57.196 --> 05:00.731
     But what are we gonna do   
     about the surprise party?  

05:00.733 --> 05:03.567
Just forget the surprise, Edith,
and give the party.             

05:03.569 --> 05:05.370
                 Oh, no, Archie!

05:05.372 --> 05:06.537
     Oh, come on, will you?     

05:06.539 --> 05:09.407
I already had one surprise party
         today anyhow.          

05:09.409 --> 05:12.076
              You had a surprise
                 party today?   

05:12.078 --> 05:13.311
Yeah, down at work.             

05:13.313 --> 05:14.913
                     Oh!        

05:16.648 --> 05:18.249
      And I knew that one       
        was coming too,         

05:18.251 --> 05:19.850
  the minute I seen that jerk   
    Stretch Cunningham          

05:19.852 --> 05:21.152
      in the locker room,       

05:21.154 --> 05:23.955
 trying to put a 6-inch candle  
      on top of a Twinkie.      

05:25.857 --> 05:28.126
                  We got you    
             your favorite cake.

05:28.128 --> 05:29.560
        Yeah.                   
  Yeah, yeah, yeah.             

05:29.562 --> 05:30.962
    You should have             
been there, Edith.              

05:30.964 --> 05:34.098
All them guys at lunchtime      
    gathering around there,     

05:34.100 --> 05:36.801
wishing me happy birthday,      
 blowing out the candle there.  

05:36.803 --> 05:39.837
    It made you proud           
    to be an American.          

05:39.839 --> 05:42.073
    It must have been hard,     

05:42.075 --> 05:46.844
    cutting up that Twinkie     
  into all them little slices.  

05:46.846 --> 05:48.712
     Use your common sense.     

05:48.714 --> 05:51.816
     They shoved it into me     
         in one piece.          

05:51.818 --> 05:52.984
    The thing that was hard     

05:52.986 --> 05:54.819
was trying to make believe      
        I was surprised.        

05:54.821 --> 05:57.688
 I had to say, "What? Who? Me?" 

05:57.690 --> 06:00.558
          Sounds like the social
        event of the season.    

06:00.560 --> 06:02.026
     Cut it out, will you?      

06:02.028 --> 06:04.628
A man's got a right to his      
    49th birthday, ain't he?    

06:04.630 --> 06:06.864
    Fiftieth, Archie.           

06:09.034 --> 06:11.635
    No, it ain't 50. I'm 49.    

06:11.637 --> 06:13.104
You're 50, Daddy.               

06:13.106 --> 06:17.541
  How can I be 50               
on my 49th birthday?            

06:17.543 --> 06:20.011
                 Because it's

14:07.613 --> 14:09.179
        You know,               
    I went in there thinking    

14:09.181 --> 14:11.982
     they was bringing back     
  one of them nice old movies.  

14:11.984 --> 14:15.352
  You know, Gene Kelly dancing  
    around the Eiffel Tower     

14:15.354 --> 14:17.254

14:17.256 --> 14:21.959
All I seen was pure pornography.

14:21.961 --> 14:23.461
Well, ain't that sexy?          

14:23.463 --> 14:25.362
              No, it ain't sexy.

14:25.364 --> 14:28.632
 The last time they made a sexy 
picture was with Gloria DeHaven.

14:28.634 --> 14:32.470
Gloria DeHaven                  
made sexy movies?               

14:32.472 --> 14:34.538
                Yeah.           
        She made sexy movies.   

14:34.540 --> 14:36.607
     I tell you another one too,
            Betty Grable.       

14:36.609 --> 14:39.510
              And she was sexy. 

14:39.512 --> 14:43.213
    But, you see, her, she never
    showed you no sex, you know?

14:43.215 --> 14:44.782
What do you mean?               

14:44.784 --> 14:46.249
        What do I mean?         

14:46.251 --> 14:48.652
    She left it all in your,    
what you call, imagination, see?

14:48.654 --> 14:51.421
She left it in your mind.       
 That's where sex ought to be.  

14:51.423 --> 14:53.457
        No.                     

14:53.459 --> 14:56.527

14:58.731 --> 15:01.799
I ain't talking about you.      
 I'm talking about the movies.  

15:01.801 --> 15:03.667
        Do you know that        
    they once insured           

15:03.669 --> 15:06.570
      Betty Grable's legs       
        for $1 million?         

15:06.572 --> 15:08.138
No.                             

15:08.140 --> 15:12.510
  I wouldn't give you two bits

     I just seen featured.      

15:22.387 --> 15:24.187
    I get the feeling           
  you didn't like that movie.

            your phone call.    

15:40.673 --> 15:44.474
          Ah-ha-ha-ha!

      on the phone there?

        that makes it all right.

        another beer here

    the things I ain't done yet.

Like what, Archie?              

16:46.639 --> 16:48.939
        Oh, I don't know, Edith,
            a lot of things.    

16:48.941 --> 16:53.677
            Well, for instance, 
        I never rode a horse.   

16:56.280 --> 16:59.650
          I never had my picture
            in the paper.       

16:59.652 --> 17:03.654
        And I ain't never ate   
            oysters rockefeller.

17:03.656 --> 17:07.124
But you've been                 
to Disney World.                

17:09.393 --> 17:11.261
Edith, you just don't know      

17:11.262 --> 17:13.363
        what I'm trying         
     to say to you, do you?     

17:13.365 --> 17:15.598
Oh, yeah, I think I do, Archie. 

17:15.601 --> 17:17.968
        I read about it         
         in a magazine.         

17:17.970 --> 17:22.839
    It said that lots of men    
go through it at a certain age. 

17:22.842 --> 17:26.977
     I mean, it's like when     
I went through the change.

But ain't it funny?             

17:48.134 --> 17:52.269
When it happens to a woman      
it's called men-opause.         

17:52.271 --> 17:54.404
                  Edith!        

17:54.406 --> 17:56.273
        Will you please, huh?   

17:56.275 --> 18:01.278
When it happens to men, maybe it
should be called women-pause.

Listen, I ain't going through

GLORIA: Oh, Ma,                 
did you find Daddy?             

19:56.128 --> 19:58.328
            Oh, yeah.           
              I found him.      

19:58.330 --> 19:59.897
    Where is he?                
What happened?                  

19:59.899 --> 20:01.198
                  Didn't he come
                  back with you?

20:01.200 --> 20:03.233
                    No.         
          Well, what did he say?

20:03.235 --> 20:07.805
 He said, "Everybody, go home.  
    The party's over."          

20:07.807 --> 20:10.707
              ALL:              
            Oh, no.             

20:10.709 --> 20:14.044
              Does that mean    
          we can't eat the cake?

20:14.046 --> 20:15.979
Then when my kid                
was six years old--             

20:15.981 --> 20:18.282
                        Oh, gee.

20:18.284 --> 20:20.684
He was in the school            
nativity play.                  

20:20.686 --> 20:23.386
Now, he practices all week      
as the innkeeper.               

20:23.388 --> 20:25.055
Then the night                  
they put the show on,           

20:25.057 --> 20:26.957
he forgets his lines.           

20:26.959 --> 20:30.794
When Joseph and Mary ask him    
if there's any room at the inn, 

20:30.796 --> 20:32.362
you know what my kid says?      

20:32.364 --> 20:33.697
                    No. What?   

20:33.699 --> 20:36.967
He says, "Sure, we're empty.    
Come on in."                    

20:40.104 --> 20:42.840
Come on, Arch.                  
It's pretty funny.              

20:42.842 --> 20:45.843
                 What's funny?  
            The kid's stupid.   

20:48.980 --> 20:49.980
         Oh, hi.                

20:49.982 --> 20:51.381
KELSEY:                         
Evening, Mr. Quigley.           

20:51.383 --> 20:53.817
     Oh, hi there, Quigley.     
 Hey, where's your girlfriend?  

20:53.819 --> 20:55.819
                    Ah, she went
                    home by cab.

20:55.821 --> 20:57.554
            I felt like walking.

20:57.556 --> 20:59.957
        I want one for the road.
What'll it be?                  

20:59.959 --> 21:01.892
    A glass of ripple.          

21:03.661 --> 21:05.863
Uh, gee, I think                
we're out of it.                

21:05.865 --> 21:09.432
    Oh. In that case,           
     make it a boilermaker.     

21:11.569 --> 21:13.270
      Hey there, Quigley,       

21:13.272 --> 21:16.273
  you're out a little bit past  
  your beddy-byes, ain't you?   

21:16.275 --> 21:18.575
        Yeah, but I thought,    
         well, I'm up this late,

21:18.577 --> 21:21.912
            I may as well       
    hang around for my birthday.

21:21.914 --> 21:24.014
          It's your             
        birthday too?           

21:24.016 --> 21:27.251
                At midnight,    
        I'll be 83 years old.   

21:27.253 --> 21:28.418
      Ooh.                      

21:28.420 --> 21:31.221
    Eighty-three.               
  Did you hear that?            

21:31.223 --> 21:33.290
    And you're still            
 celebrating birthdays?         

21:33.292 --> 21:35.125
          Looking forward to it.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.227
             You know what Jo's 
             giving me tomorrow?

21:37.229 --> 21:39.396
                A set of        
        French-language records.

21:39.398 --> 21:41.498
You're going to                 
start learning French?          

21:41.500 --> 21:44.101
              Something I always
                wanted to do.   

21:44.103 --> 21:45.302
You mean to tell me             

21:45.304 --> 21:47.637
you're planning on maybe        
taking a trip to France?        

21:47.639 --> 21:49.606
        Well, you never know.   

21:49.608 --> 21:52.910
        You know the old saying,
          "A rolling stone..."  

21:52.912 --> 21:53.911
Yeah.                           

21:53.913 --> 21:56.746
              "...can give you  
            a hell of a bruise."

22:01.920 --> 22:04.687
          Hey, let me           
  ask you something, Quigley.   

22:05.823 --> 22:08.025
        Did you ever            
        ride a horse?           

22:08.027 --> 22:10.593
    Not 'til I was 63.          

22:10.595 --> 22:13.130
          Sixty-three?          

22:13.132 --> 22:15.198
                            Mmm.

22:15.200 --> 22:16.967
     What about a ukulele?      

22:16.969 --> 22:20.470
     I don't think you can      
        ride a ukulele.         

22:24.708 --> 22:26.576
I didn't mean that.             
  I mean, uh, me.               

22:26.578 --> 22:29.612
That I was thinking maybe       
I'd learn how to play one.      

22:29.614 --> 22:30.780
                    Oh, yeah?   
        Yeah.                   

22:30.782 --> 22:33.616
You know, play some             
of them nice songs              

22:33.618 --> 22:36.686
like "Home on the Range,"       
 "South of Your Border."        

22:36.688 --> 22:39.222
"Red Sails in the Sunset."      

22:39.224 --> 22:42.292
         Oh, yeah. Modern stuff.
                 Mm-hmm.        

22:42.294 --> 22:45.495
     You ought to hear the songs
        I was brought up with.  

22:45.497 --> 22:48.798
You young sprigs have missed out
    on a lot of good tunes.

Hey, hey, hey, hey. You hear    
 what he's calling us here?     

22:51.036 --> 22:52.635

young sprigs, huh, Kels?        

22:57.142 --> 22:59.476
  And after all, maybe we are.  

22:59.478 --> 23:00.610
         Sure.                  

23:00.612 --> 23:03.046

just thinking now?              

23:03.048 --> 23:06.850
 The best thing to do is not    
look back at the past at all.   

23:06.852 --> 23:09.019
Just get up and move            
     with the times.            

23:09.021 --> 23:12.622
              Mmm. I'll try to  
            remember that.      

23:12.624 --> 23:16.159
Hey, listen, back at the house, 
that birthday cake back there.  

23:16.161 --> 23:17.627
Did they swallow it all?        

23:17.629 --> 23:20.097
            Oh, no. They saved  
        a big piece for you.

     Yeah? Come on!
