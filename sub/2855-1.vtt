01:04.405 --> 01:05.781
Miss Rahm?

01:18.169 --> 01:22.589
Thus, it is enough for today.
Mr. Rauch is visited.

01:41.317 --> 01:43.110
Armand Rauch?

01:45.780 --> 01:51.618
I am Sophia Rahme
my mother was Famke Rahm.

01:52.578 --> 01:55.872
Her sister has
studied in Argentina.

01:58.751 --> 02:01.002
I think I'm your cousin.

02:01.170 --> 02:02.838
Cousin?

02:04.841 --> 02:09.594
My girl,
you still need to see.

02:13.516 --> 02:17.894
Tell me
how you found me.

02:22.108 --> 02:26.236
It was not easy.
But now I'm here, Uncle.

02:26.863 --> 02:31.783
Or should I say, General? Thus,
nevertheless, Neurath General of the SS?

02:32.952 --> 02:37.664
I called Rauch.
Armand Rauch.

02:38.583 --> 02:44.337
Do you remember Mathieu Jonas?
You were glad when he died down.

02:44.881 --> 02:47.299
But he had a daughter.

02:49.469 --> 02:53.346
This was my mother.

02:55.558 --> 03:00.020
And this was my father.

03:01.689 --> 03:06.067
And this soldier of them
liberated from the concentration camp.

03:07.278 --> 03:09.863
I saw them die while
to you and the others were looking for.

03:09.947 --> 03:14.159
Each time you feel pain,
for them.

03:14.243 --> 03:16.786
Jewish bitch, whore.

03:17.997 --> 03:21.541
There is a reason
for you not to die.

03:21.626 --> 03:24.169
Liver Klaus Listener to me.

03:24.754 --> 03:29.841
If you give me Klaus Listener, I will
not suffocate with a pillow.

03:30.343 --> 03:33.803
What a nerve.

03:34.555 --> 03:38.350
Still shaking your hands.

03:39.268 --> 03:40.810
I am helpless.

03:42.772 --> 03:44.356
Do it.

03:53.533 --> 03:54.658
Typical.

03:55.451 --> 03:59.829
You know, there is a reason
why all this started.

03:59.914 --> 04:02.874
And now when I look at you as ...

04:03.084 --> 04:08.421
I remember what it was.

04:13.803 --> 04:18.682
Well, but you are too proud to
not something to have withheld.

04:19.141 --> 04:20.725
Souvenirs?

04:47.086 --> 04:51.298
Even if you find Klaus Ontario,
that nothing will change.

04:52.508 --> 04:55.844
You're too late.

04:58.014 --> 05:03.435
You do not know, eh?
-- What do you mean?

05:04.228 --> 05:08.064
Hunt Who is this?
Is he a scientist?

05:08.149 --> 05:12.068
Why do you finance his work in Europe?
Is Klaus Ener there?

05:12.153 --> 05:14.279
Answer the question.

05:14.405 --> 05:19.576
Do you still see yourself,
a child who plays detective.

05:20.328 --> 05:25.874
The Millennial Kingdom hides
really not for people like you.

05:26.167 --> 05:29.669
It is simply lurking
in the shade.

05:35.509 --> 05:39.179
Damn.
Come on, quietly.

05:40.306 --> 05:43.224
Do not you dare to die.

05:58.032 --> 05:59.282
Damn.

06:49.083 --> 06:51.126
Doctor?

06:51.711 --> 06:56.256
They arrived.
We have them in sight.

06:57.967 --> 06:59.718
Herr Klaus Listener?

07:15.484 --> 07:17.193
EASTERN EUROPE

07:17.278 --> 07:19.320
Control unit, secure the location.

07:20.322 --> 07:22.574
The assault team is leading.

07:49.435 --> 07:52.270
There are cartridge cases
and fresh blood.

07:52.354 --> 07:55.690
No sign of the searched or his team.

08:02.448 --> 08:04.783
We are now approaching the machine room.

08:06.619 --> 08:08.870
We see the engine room.

08:31.852 --> 08:38.732
We need them out of there.
-- It is too late, Josef.

08:40.903 --> 08:42.445
But the command is executed.

08:47.034 --> 08:52.372
Be happy Josef.
This is the beginning.

10:45.569 --> 10:48.738
I'm sorry,
I speak the language.

10:53.661 --> 10:55.203
Give me a break.

11:07.841 --> 11:10.259
I have money, take that ...

11:11.261 --> 11:14.764
Enough.
Let her, Marius.

11:35.619 --> 11:38.413
Are you a journalist?
-- No.

11:39.331 --> 11:44.210
Women now have not come here.
-- I am looking for this man.

11:44.503 --> 11:48.047
He was here a week or two back
have been.

11:49.091 --> 11:50.717
Yes, he was here.

11:51.135 --> 11:54.220
He said some soldiers,
who were not from here.

11:54.304 --> 11:58.725
They went to the east.
-- To the east, so?

11:58.809 --> 12:03.146
Since you really can not go.
Do you see the families out there?

12:03.897 --> 12:07.692
They come from there. Their houses are
burned, their families killed.

12:08.277 --> 12:11.404
They talk about horrible things.

12:11.488 --> 12:14.240
Can Hunt via a different route
come back?

12:14.324 --> 12:17.326
He has not come back.
He's dead.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.877
You look old.
-- Thank you.

12:26.920 --> 12:31.799
Now you're here, I'd like a whiskey.
-- Two double.

12:33.177 --> 12:34.927
He pays.

12:37.556 --> 12:42.268
Boy, she's grown.
-- It is long ago.

12:43.145 --> 12:47.774
And a lot has happened.
Where have you been?

12:48.650 --> 12:50.151
Everywhere and nowhere.

12:52.071 --> 12:55.406
I heard about Mathieu.
Horrible.

12:57.201 --> 13:01.829
A car accident, right?
-- Yes, it was an accident.

13:01.997 --> 13:04.791
That explains why Neurath
not lived long enough ...

13:04.875 --> 13:08.920
Paraguay to stand trial.
-- That was an accident.

13:09.004 --> 13:14.175
He supplied from Hunt, and now you're
here looking for Klaus Ontario, eh?

13:14.426 --> 13:17.261
I'm on the right track.
Hunt is just like you.

13:17.888 --> 13:21.599
Looking for those weird magnets.
-- The unified field theory.

13:21.683 --> 13:24.644
Whatever.
-- Yes, he worked on the same.

13:24.728 --> 13:28.815
And you want not. Go home.
-- Absolutely not.

13:28.899 --> 13:33.653
Lena, have you ever listened to him?
This is real.

13:33.737 --> 13:37.240
This goes to the prize.
-- Geez.

13:41.954 --> 13:44.080
Take a look.

13:48.085 --> 13:52.296
A reaction of NATO fighting
here in secret for two weeks.

14:57.321 --> 14:58.654
Mama?

14:59.615 --> 15:01.157
Still ...

15:18.175 --> 15:21.510
A couple of guys dressed as ...
-- You do not understand.

15:24.389 --> 15:27.808
Götz, camp commander.
That bastard died in 1945.

15:34.233 --> 15:37.360
He looks lively for a corpse.

15:42.324 --> 15:45.826
Klaus has Listener that?
Really?

15:45.911 --> 15:50.206
It's not about old men
retirement homes, Lena.

15:52.251 --> 15:54.293
You know where he is.
-- Go home.

15:54.378 --> 15:56.462
Forget it.
-- I've tried.

15:56.546 --> 15:59.799
Take me.
-- That I will not do.

15:59.967 --> 16:02.510
Klaus Ontario is the last. I grabbed him
and for me it's over.

16:02.594 --> 16:07.265
Good luck.
It was nice to see you.

16:16.024 --> 16:17.108
So ...

16:20.487 --> 16:25.533
How is the Listener Klaus succeeded?
They look like ghosts.

16:25.617 --> 16:30.079
That sounds romantic but so far
of reality is not.

16:30.163 --> 16:35.710
Looky Klaus Listener's machine. This
you have the perfect army behind you.

16:35.794 --> 16:39.297
He would force a special
treatment have given.

16:39.381 --> 16:40.423
Nice.

16:40.507 --> 16:45.094
A treatment in combination with
the magnetic field of the machine.

16:45.178 --> 16:48.639
Suddenly the men are not like us.

16:48.724 --> 16:52.893
Within the magnetic field, they do
what they want, bullets do nothing.

16:53.687 --> 16:56.439
This is three weeks reversed.

16:57.024 --> 17:00.443
Nothing unusual,
though it is a civil war.

17:00.527 --> 17:03.404
This is two weeks old
made after Hunt disappeared.

17:03.488 --> 17:06.531
This area
is an electromagnetic field.

17:06.616 --> 17:09.076
Vehicles, communications, aircraft ...

17:09.161 --> 17:11.287
anything with electronics in it does nothing.

17:11.371 --> 17:16.083
It is exactly what Klaus Listener
was last stationed.

17:16.960 --> 17:19.127
This is from three days ago.

17:19.296 --> 17:22.464
Now that it has a cross--section
of 50 kilometers.

17:22.549 --> 17:25.509
Götz and his men extend it.

17:25.969 --> 17:30.848
Where do they go?
-- Everywhere, that is what they want.

17:32.059 --> 17:34.518
The Millennial Kingdom ...

17:39.191 --> 17:43.194
Right. Here we go.

17:46.907 --> 17:48.949
Come on, let's go.

17:49.534 --> 17:52.578
What is going on?
-- We have a task force of the UN.

17:52.662 --> 17:56.082
We believe that chemical
weapons are used.

17:56.166 --> 17:58.042
The population may have ...

17:58.126 --> 18:01.712
this area for a short time left
because of their safety.

18:03.632 --> 18:04.673
Clear.

18:06.009 --> 18:08.427
We gotta go.
-- Chemical weapons?

18:08.553 --> 18:12.264
Bullshit. Why such a big
disclose secret ...

18:12.349 --> 18:14.975
if you steal it for yourself?
-- They do not.

18:15.060 --> 18:17.520
Many governments will
everything for free ...

18:17.604 --> 18:20.940
Klaus to Ontario or the machine access.
We must go now.

18:21.024 --> 18:25.486
What would you do? The yield
donate to charity?

18:25.570 --> 18:30.324
I have searched in Russia Klaus Listener,
and trusted the wrong people.

18:33.703 --> 18:38.416
Make sure you're not in jail
comes. It's cold.

18:38.500 --> 18:42.336
After one year there were suddenly two men
of the embassy.

18:42.421 --> 18:44.922
I thought that get me out of here.

18:45.090 --> 18:48.717
But when they noticed
I knew nothing about the machine ...

18:48.802 --> 18:50.678
they let me rot.

18:50.804 --> 18:54.640
Nobody should such a powerful thing
in his possession.

18:56.017 --> 18:57.726
I just want Klaus Listener.

18:59.980 --> 19:02.523
Klaus Sat Listener
in an underground bunker.

19:02.607 --> 19:05.568
If this card is correct,
it's two days of traveling.

19:05.652 --> 19:10.364
Why we have my equipment,
my car and my money?

19:11.450 --> 19:15.828
We go to a camp of the militia.
I have a contact: Limak.

19:15.912 --> 19:19.331
For the right price he will
and his men serve as guides.

19:19.416 --> 19:21.542
Do you trust him?
-- Of course not.

19:21.626 --> 19:25.337
But I do not go there
unaccompanied.

19:41.688 --> 19:44.190
It is still a mile.

19:44.274 --> 19:46.817
Turn left into a dirt road.

19:51.239 --> 19:52.948
Come on.

20:02.375 --> 20:04.627
I think we're there.

20:04.753 --> 20:09.006
The field is expanding faster
than I thought.

20:28.360 --> 20:33.113
Get your stuff. The faster
guidance we have, the better.

20:36.493 --> 20:38.827
Stitch, a camp of the militia.

20:40.914 --> 20:43.165
That is, are you ready?

20:54.719 --> 20:57.263
Limak.

21:04.479 --> 21:05.521
Come.

21:17.742 --> 21:20.536
Limak, damn.

21:30.839 --> 21:34.133
Be still, hold your breath.

23:02.472 --> 23:04.765
We must continue.

23:11.523 --> 23:13.816
Lena ...

23:15.110 --> 23:18.487
we must go.

23:27.122 --> 23:29.623
From this direction we have come.

23:30.959 --> 23:34.002
We can now to the blow--off.

23:34.421 --> 23:36.130
The car does nothing.

23:36.214 --> 23:40.718
On foot, we can tomorrow
on the other side.

23:40.844 --> 23:43.011
Say it.

24:16.963 --> 24:19.423
Special forces.

24:23.303 --> 24:25.804
Look.

24:26.055 --> 24:29.475
An EMP, electromagnetic pulse.

24:30.018 --> 24:31.351
He fires off a beam of energy ...

24:31.436 --> 24:35.731
that everything electrical within
destroy a certain distance. Handsome.

24:36.274 --> 24:37.649
They want to get close ...

24:37.734 --> 24:40.819
and destroy the machine.
-- Do we take him?

24:40.904 --> 24:43.947
We can use it in the bunker.
-- He is broken.

24:44.199 --> 24:46.700
We better go.

27:22.357 --> 27:24.274
What are these?

27:25.151 --> 27:28.987
The runic symbols.

27:32.867 --> 27:34.284
Here you go.

27:35.036 --> 27:40.874
There was a Nazi division with special
Weapons, called the Black Sun

27:41.584 --> 27:44.086
They use the symbol
in all their documents.

27:44.170 --> 27:49.466
I think it's a code, a
password for the machine to send.

27:49.968 --> 27:54.388
It has taken years on tight.
-- A decade or so.

27:55.473 --> 27:58.767
I could at least choose.
Mathieu also.

27:59.602 --> 28:04.356
Have you ever wanted to do something else?
-- I do not know.

28:04.774 --> 28:07.693
At first I thought all families
did.

28:08.194 --> 28:12.155
In South America
Search for old men.

28:13.533 --> 28:19.329
And one evening,
I think I was ten ...

28:19.831 --> 28:22.165
sneaked into his room.

28:23.126 --> 28:26.128
He stood on the balcony crying.

28:26.713 --> 28:30.799
And on the bed were all those pictures.

28:33.261 --> 28:36.596
Klaus Listener and the others,
the things they had done.

28:38.099 --> 28:43.520
I had never seen him cry.
-- If you've caught Klaus Ener ...

28:43.646 --> 28:45.522
what then?

28:47.984 --> 28:52.446
No idea.
Then I can choose in each case.

28:57.869 --> 29:00.704
There will always be somebody.

29:00.997 --> 29:05.542
Someone who does everything for power,
another Klaus Listener.

29:06.294 --> 29:11.131
People are like that.
-- The following is not my problem.

30:41.430 --> 30:46.393
Damn it.
-- Road here, flight.

31:00.700 --> 31:03.827
Come.
Lena?

31:07.707 --> 31:09.749
Godsamme.

31:10.251 --> 31:11.376
Inside.

31:22.680 --> 31:23.930
Damn.

31:24.056 --> 31:26.099
Cover the right.
-- Cover the left.

31:28.060 --> 31:29.102
No ...

31:38.196 --> 31:40.822
Faster, forward.

31:43.743 --> 31:44.868
Glen ...

31:49.624 --> 31:52.375
Road here, walk.

31:52.501 --> 31:54.002
Hurry up.

31:59.050 --> 32:00.508
Faster.

32:04.305 --> 32:09.559
Take cover, shoot.
-- Cover.

32:09.644 --> 32:11.561
Beware, friendly fire.

32:11.646 --> 32:14.147
Come on.
-- Fire with the EMP.

32:15.816 --> 32:18.235
Come on, do it now.
-- Contact.

32:23.616 --> 32:27.369
What are you waiting for?
I told you to fire.

32:27.453 --> 32:28.495
That is not the mission.

32:28.579 --> 32:31.873
If we perish,
there is no longer mission.

33:24.719 --> 33:27.012
That was it.

33:34.353 --> 33:36.521
It'll be fine.

33:51.203 --> 33:53.621
Stay with me, pal.

34:17.396 --> 34:18.438
Damn.

34:18.522 --> 34:22.525
Are you going to do bold?
See, that was my buddy.

34:22.610 --> 34:26.362
He died to save you.
Soon you see look like that.

34:26.447 --> 34:28.572
Relax.

34:30.076 --> 34:34.579
What are you doing in this enclosed area?
-- We are journalists.

34:34.663 --> 34:36.289
Yes?

34:39.085 --> 34:41.335
Against the wall.
Fingers.

34:41.795 --> 34:43.797
I'll take that.

34:45.007 --> 34:47.509
Legs apart.

34:48.302 --> 34:52.013
I see the error
or the operation failed completely?

34:52.098 --> 34:54.516
The physics teacher is dead.
What did he say again?

34:54.600 --> 34:57.268
It's all or nothing,
You only get one chance.

34:57.353 --> 35:00.063
Don't blow not.
-- As if we had the choice.

35:00.147 --> 35:04.234
They are dead, and we go there too.
-- Shut up, Hall.

35:06.112 --> 35:08.488
No press pass and no camera.

35:08.572 --> 35:12.659
But you know your story,
Mr. Wallace.

35:13.411 --> 35:17.580
What I want to know,
is how he recognized you.

35:19.667 --> 35:23.503
He saw me for someone else.
-- It was a klotedag.

35:23.921 --> 35:26.756
Stop that bullshit.

35:26.841 --> 35:29.759
Shoot him, you know 't ever.
-- It is.

35:29.844 --> 35:36.099
Hall, put her in the eye.
-- Good. Hold on.

35:40.855 --> 35:43.356
I am engineer.

35:45.860 --> 35:50.155
Are you a scientist?
Physical, surely?

35:50.573 --> 35:54.033
Is she your secretary?
-- I am looking for war criminals, Nazis.

35:54.118 --> 35:56.953
Then you're good here, darling.

35:57.037 --> 36:00.832
And here is what you want
get their hands on, right?

36:00.916 --> 36:05.753
And do not you?
Please, let me guess.

36:06.297 --> 36:09.799
You warrant to stop the machine
and save the world.

36:09.884 --> 36:13.094
And bring so
Muir thought it worked.

36:13.179 --> 36:17.307
Firstly:
I recommend you go to nothing, asshole.

36:17.391 --> 36:20.477
Secondly,
how do you know he Muir called?

36:24.607 --> 36:25.690
Damn.

36:28.027 --> 36:29.194
Sucks.

36:32.990 --> 36:35.116
You better talk.

36:35.951 --> 36:39.787
There are few specialists in this field.
-- That they say.

36:40.289 --> 36:42.665
So this is your lucky day.

36:42.750 --> 36:46.169
Throw him in the car,
we have a new expert.

36:46.253 --> 36:47.712
One moment.

36:47.796 --> 36:50.673
Remember that this operation
of fell ...

36:50.758 --> 36:53.426
when the second EMP failed.

36:53.511 --> 36:57.138
This operation is not over until
I tell you.

36:57.223 --> 36:59.849
You know what happens
if we do nothing.

37:04.188 --> 37:07.857
Does that pulse magnetic field
deactivated?

37:07.942 --> 37:10.068
Then we can kill them.

37:10.152 --> 37:12.403
No, the EMP has a limited
scope.

37:12.488 --> 37:15.823
We had to close.
-- He's right.

37:15.908 --> 37:20.078
This device is good for
five or six miles at most.

37:20.371 --> 37:24.040
How far are we from the goal?
-- Thirteen miles.

37:24.124 --> 37:27.252
The next ten kilometers
we can afknallen.

37:27.336 --> 37:29.003
Then you think thirteen kilometers ...

37:29.088 --> 37:33.800
how my mission without that thing
may close, Mr. Wallace.

37:36.554 --> 37:39.931
Welcome to the emptier boy.
-- What a luck I have.

37:59.743 --> 38:02.161
Where do you go?

38:02.705 --> 38:05.832
No academic qualifications, no place.
-- View the.

38:05.916 --> 38:10.628
A lady here leave neat.
-- We go.

38:10.713 --> 38:13.006
We encircle the bag.

38:16.635 --> 38:20.305
Find a safe place.
A basement, somewhere underground.

38:20.389 --> 38:23.975
With luck, the cavalry
within a day.

38:26.353 --> 38:28.646
If you remember way back ...

38:28.772 --> 38:30.398
go back.

38:31.191 --> 38:32.775
Jesus ...

39:08.354 --> 39:09.437
Sir ...

39:10.439 --> 39:14.275
Bravo--Charlie--4, this is the command.
-- Go ahead.

39:14.360 --> 39:18.446
There is a pulse in the field shot.
-- How close to the target?

39:18.530 --> 39:21.366
Not close enough.
-- Can you see who it was?

39:21.450 --> 39:24.327
The location indicates the Alpha team.

39:24.411 --> 39:26.579
But we're not sure.
-- And Team Beta?

39:26.664 --> 39:30.500
A mild rash five hours back.
Too little for a real shot.

39:30.584 --> 39:32.794
Previously a refusal.
-- Damn.

39:39.134 --> 39:42.845
If both teams are off,
we see our options.

39:42.930 --> 39:47.100
There is still time.
-- Without EMP to nothing.

39:47.184 --> 39:49.894
We need to go.
-- This is my battlefield.

39:49.978 --> 39:54.524
I decide on the deployment of nuclear
weapons. There is still time, we wait.

39:54.608 --> 39:56.442
Clear?

40:46.452 --> 40:50.079
No, it's not scary, nor stupid.

40:51.373 --> 40:54.250
No academic qualifications, no place.

40:54.460 --> 40:58.463
At which university they
learn to push ups? Acorns.

43:25.068 --> 43:26.944
Come.

43:30.532 --> 43:33.659
Come out of the way.
-- Where is my notebook?

43:33.744 --> 43:36.495
Wait, my notebook.

43:36.622 --> 43:39.290
Further down dip.

43:43.086 --> 43:44.337
No ...

43:49.468 --> 43:51.552
Let me go.

43:55.849 --> 43:58.309
No ...

43:59.102 --> 44:01.604
I have had you not done anything?

45:43.915 --> 45:46.459
Nothing.
They are here.

45:50.964 --> 45:54.717
That he injected him?
What did he do?

45:56.845 --> 45:58.679
No idea.

45:59.264 --> 46:01.891
Maybe he wanted him
just like they make.

46:02.267 --> 46:04.560
Nazis are real bastards.

46:04.644 --> 46:07.813
Without my notebook
I can not do anything.

46:07.898 --> 46:10.691
Without the codes and symbols ...
-- Zeik not.

46:10.776 --> 46:14.570
Without your balls
would you worse bleating.

46:16.573 --> 46:20.159
But you've worked there for years.
-- Jae very long.

46:20.243 --> 46:23.079
Therefore, I had just a notebook.

46:27.918 --> 46:30.836
Write down everything, okay?

46:34.841 --> 46:39.804
Dane this has taken time.
We must go faster.

46:41.723 --> 46:45.309
With you, I need to talk.

46:50.273 --> 46:53.067
What are you doing here?
-- Thanks for coming.

46:53.151 --> 46:58.030
If you just bothers me ...
-- We must hurry.

46:58.115 --> 47:01.951
Then manage it before the big bang.
-- Blast?

47:04.788 --> 47:07.039
If it is not
within the prescribed time does ...

47:07.124 --> 47:10.417
they assume that it fails
and they choose the latter option.

47:10.502 --> 47:13.587
Seven tonnes up.

47:20.095 --> 47:22.012
There are thousands of people live here.

47:22.097 --> 47:25.099
And millions of people die
if we do not stop.

47:25.183 --> 47:29.854
It should make us succeed.
To discuss what nobody.

47:31.231 --> 47:33.524
Wait, now she suddenly last?

47:37.445 --> 47:41.824
As a babysitter for Hansel and Gretel,
what madness.

48:16.359 --> 48:18.694
Here it should be.

48:55.565 --> 48:58.901
I had expected
that this printer would be.

48:59.194 --> 49:02.821
They celebrate feast elsewhere.
-- Yes, whether it is a perfect trap.

49:02.906 --> 49:07.368
The main entrance is in any case
the end of our career.

49:08.536 --> 49:12.414
Set the safe side, find the
Rear entry, you have five minutes.

49:13.875 --> 49:17.503
Do not forget:
I know the machine, not them.

49:17.587 --> 49:21.882
I try something. Can not run.
-- And Klaus Listener?

49:23.510 --> 49:25.511
With him, you must pay.

49:28.640 --> 49:31.558
Until now, the child,
now it is intense.

49:31.643 --> 49:35.396
If we strike
we do it as fast as possible.

49:40.193 --> 49:43.070
The field is empty.
-- Nothing, not even a rabbit hole.

49:43.154 --> 49:45.531
Carlisle left, right--Hall.

49:45.615 --> 49:49.827
Abbott, we take the center with the
girls. Position your at the doors.

50:03.341 --> 50:04.591
Keep going.

50:11.474 --> 50:12.933
Continue.

50:17.272 --> 50:21.025
What happened here?
-- Is not nut out.

50:21.109 --> 50:23.277
Looking for cables, in this thickness.

50:23.361 --> 50:27.156
That we should follow.
-- And then? Without EMP?

50:27.240 --> 50:29.950
I must go to the command center.
-- Forward.

51:55.370 --> 51:57.496
That's him.

52:08.007 --> 52:09.425
Inside.

52:21.563 --> 52:23.939
He should be here his shit.

52:25.442 --> 52:30.279
Damn it.
-- He should be here.

52:30.780 --> 52:34.283
The military intelligence
delivers again great work.

52:39.747 --> 52:43.125
That is ...
This is Hunt's handwriting.

52:44.335 --> 52:47.087
Check this out.

52:54.596 --> 53:03.979
And Klaus Listener?

53:11.571 --> 53:13.614
Since there are even more.

53:23.791 --> 53:24.875
Here.

53:29.339 --> 53:31.256
Hunt's notes prove ...

53:31.341 --> 53:33.926
that he only works
and solves problems.

53:34.093 --> 53:39.181
Klaus Listener is not been here.
-- Why?

53:39.265 --> 53:43.894
That is not logical.
-- Klaus Energy Hunt sent hither.

53:47.482 --> 53:52.027
Klaus Ener wanted or could not be here.

53:52.654 --> 53:55.322
Hunt put everything in motion.

53:55.949 --> 54:00.911
Klaus Listener's men
search for daddy.

54:00.995 --> 54:07.459
There is a cell or something.
-- It's a cell.

54:08.002 --> 54:13.298
The energy of the motor there was
together since they were created.

54:39.909 --> 54:42.536
Always the right answers.

54:45.748 --> 54:48.375
Can you infer
where they have gone?

54:48.459 --> 54:53.130
Where does' t magnetic field
come from? -- No idea.

54:53.464 --> 54:56.592
The notes are those of
a lunatic. Look.

54:56.676 --> 54:59.720
Hunt also what they have done,
it was diabolical.

54:59.804 --> 55:03.473
Everything revolves around the field
and energy generation.

55:03.558 --> 55:06.268
I look at it again better.
-- No.

55:06.352 --> 55:09.605
Take as much as you can bear,
we leave here.

55:09.689 --> 55:13.859
This material is unheard important.
-- It was not a question.

55:28.124 --> 55:31.918
Ready?
-- I can not just go.

55:32.003 --> 55:35.881
About eight hours
everything here is completely charred.

55:35.965 --> 55:39.801
If we do not go
we are not at a safe distance.

55:40.928 --> 55:46.099
Take your pick.
-- I really thought I was close.

55:46.184 --> 55:50.145
It's been pretty
that you've met up here.

55:50.938 --> 55:52.981
The next time you pick it.

55:58.863 --> 56:01.239
Your friend Wallace is right.

56:01.616 --> 56:05.786
I had the machine safeguarding
and Klaus Listener nab.

56:06.537 --> 56:09.956
You have many powerful friends.

56:11.459 --> 56:14.836
Maybe I can
to some people imagine.

56:16.047 --> 56:17.506
Well?

56:22.679 --> 56:23.762
Beware.

56:54.335 --> 56:58.839
Let go away there.
-- Make sure you get away.

56:59.382 --> 57:01.758
Coverage.
-- On the ground.

57:01.843 --> 57:03.719
Let go.

57:04.220 --> 57:05.262
Road here.

57:05.346 --> 57:08.306
Not back inside, outside.

57:09.100 --> 57:10.392
Sam ...

57:39.255 --> 57:42.340
Time's up.
We gotta go.

57:53.936 --> 57:57.773
Regret it
you need the sector.

57:58.024 --> 58:00.901
We can send one.
Confirm, please.

58:00.985 --> 58:02.778
We need support.

58:04.655 --> 58:07.574
Send us reinforcements.
They break through.

58:07.658 --> 58:10.118
Sire contact with the enemy
the defenses.

58:10.203 --> 58:11.828
One mile east.

58:13.915 --> 58:16.625
That was it.

58:30.014 --> 58:34.142
He still had at least
can leave an address.

58:37.438 --> 58:39.856
Where would you place him?

58:48.241 --> 58:53.078
Lena, he is still here.
The machine is not moved.

58:53.204 --> 58:55.121
That's impossible ...

58:55.206 --> 58:58.917
for he is always in the center
of the field that it generates.

58:59.001 --> 59:01.711
The map shows only other trees.

59:04.507 --> 59:08.218
This is really ridiculous.

59:09.095 --> 59:13.139
Have fun searching
to the secret room, darling.

59:13.224 --> 59:17.102
I 'm out for me under
terechtkom a mushroom cloud.

59:17.186 --> 59:19.020
The operation is not over yet.

59:19.105 --> 59:21.857
He is carefully hidden somewhere.

59:21.941 --> 59:27.362
Along with Elvis and the Easter Bunny.
-- He's right. We're ready.

59:27.446 --> 59:30.073
My hero.
-- Damn ...

59:30.741 --> 59:34.411
Many people find that 'never give up
Him or Her romantic mentality.

59:34.495 --> 59:38.665
But I would prefer your head
rams against the wall.

59:38.749 --> 59:45.005
Macavoy is dead, the machine is gone,
this mission is over.

59:45.089 --> 59:48.508
You can not go, there is still a chance.
-- Yes?

59:48.593 --> 59:52.345
Since when you tell us
what to do, Princess?

59:52.430 --> 59:57.058
Danny, this is for tough guys.
We go off like a hare.

59:57.143 --> 01:00:01.062
And where? If you go now,
You can keep running.

01:00:01.147 --> 01:00:02.898
Because they do not stop.

01:00:02.982 --> 01:00:05.567
Not in the next village or country.

01:00:05.735 --> 01:00:10.780
We can only stop here.
-- Forget it.

01:00:11.866 --> 01:00:13.617
Let them go.

01:00:18.331 --> 01:00:22.792
He was right about you all.
Go to hell.

01:00:39.477 --> 01:00:40.936
Danny?

01:00:48.444 --> 01:00:50.236
Damn.

01:01:00.039 --> 01:01:01.081
Best.

01:01:01.415 --> 01:01:05.710
Look for an entrance,
for anything unusual.

01:01:05.795 --> 01:01:08.046
As if something just is.

01:01:08.130 --> 01:01:12.384
And lay a trail of breadcrumbs,
for if you get lost.

01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:41.913
What is the most logical reason
to move it?

01:01:47.795 --> 01:01:50.630
Are you really sure?
-- Yes.

01:01:53.759 --> 01:01:55.635
Fucking shit.

01:01:57.179 --> 01:02:01.891
Was I 'm but smeared
but it was too late.

01:02:05.563 --> 01:02:08.023
Where are you right answers?

01:02:32.506 --> 01:02:35.425
We need this wall.

01:02:35.509 --> 01:02:37.343
But of course.

01:02:37.762 --> 01:02:41.806
Do you have a nervous breakdown?
Is that it?

01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:48.188
Look for a panel
on the other side.

01:02:50.983 --> 01:02:53.443
This should be up there.

01:02:53.527 --> 01:02:57.405
It was written
when this door was still open.

01:02:57.490 --> 01:02:59.032
Here there is one.

01:03:02.036 --> 01:03:03.161
Good.

01:03:42.159 --> 01:03:45.203
This is a well hidden elevator.

01:03:49.917 --> 01:03:53.002
What do we do now?
-- What we always do.

01:03:53.462 --> 01:03:55.672
You light fires bullets.

01:03:59.093 --> 01:04:00.969
Once we're outside, you shoot them.

01:04:01.053 --> 01:04:05.140
Then the planes that we know
here and they blow the whole thing not.

01:04:06.809 --> 01:04:08.893
Stay alive, girls.

01:04:08.978 --> 01:04:13.356
Nobody believes me later
if you do not confirm.

01:04:22.825 --> 01:04:27.203
I go first, you follow.
And keep you quiet.

01:04:37.298 --> 01:04:40.175
Do you know how you use it?

01:07:02.192 --> 01:07:03.609
Wallace ...

01:07:06.405 --> 01:07:07.488
That way.

01:08:35.953 --> 01:08:37.787
Here, take this.

01:08:49.925 --> 01:08:52.343
Come.
Damn.

01:09:06.649 --> 01:09:11.194
Let me go.
-- Small gypsy jew.

01:09:11.279 --> 01:09:15.992
Hold on.
Let me go, damn bitch.

01:09:16.493 --> 01:09:19.245
No ...

01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:36.095
Come.

01:10:01.788 --> 01:10:16.093
Children.

01:10:21.558 --> 01:10:24.977
Here, this should be the control room.

01:10:30.192 --> 01:10:31.734
Fri

01:10:33.403 --> 01:10:37.823
Do you know what you're looking for?
-- A kind of schedule over the ministry.

01:10:43.830 --> 01:10:46.207
Here, good.

01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:49.919
The machine and the expansion chambers
are there ...

01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:52.880
and from here to be sent.

01:10:53.090 --> 01:10:57.468
Here's the inside that divides it.
-- Can you do that?

01:10:58.637 --> 01:11:00.888
Yes, it works
as a pressure cooker.

01:11:00.973 --> 01:11:06.185
We maximize the ability
that generates the complex ...

01:11:06.270 --> 01:11:11.148
and then block the energy drain.
We overload the system.

01:11:11.608 --> 01:11:13.901
That is our EMP.

01:11:25.372 --> 01:11:30.084
No, no. That's not fair.

01:11:30.168 --> 01:11:33.129
What is that?
-- Safety Vent.

01:11:37.301 --> 01:11:39.176
Handsome machine.

01:11:48.228 --> 01:11:51.439
That works well. We're almost there.

01:11:53.442 --> 01:11:57.361
Stop it now goes.
-- What?

01:11:57.571 --> 01:12:01.657
The system is well designed,
it does not want me to destroy.

01:12:05.495 --> 01:12:07.204
Damn.

01:12:13.337 --> 01:12:17.423
You must go, I must stay here.
-- Only you know the machine.

01:12:17.507 --> 01:12:21.052
If I go, then, can we never
to fire off an EMP.

01:12:21.136 --> 01:12:24.513
If we wait until he has fired?
-- We can not do.

01:12:24.598 --> 01:12:27.224
If things go wrong,
we never come here.

01:12:27.309 --> 01:12:31.354
Here, if the pulse did not work try this.
There is a kind face.

01:12:31.438 --> 01:12:35.941
Save it with a hammer or whatever on.
Forward.

01:12:36.068 --> 01:12:40.780
And take care of yourself.

01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:58.422
Alright.

01:13:49.599 --> 01:13:56.230
Come. Well verdommee
cheap rattletrap.

01:15:05.717 --> 01:15:09.970
Is that Klaus Listener?
-- No. It is Hunt.

01:15:22.901 --> 01:15:25.694
Come, godsamme.

01:15:27.989 --> 01:15:29.406
Forward.

01:16:03.275 --> 01:16:04.900
Sieg Heil, bitch.

01:16:21.001 --> 01:16:23.627
It failed.

01:17:13.887 --> 01:17:15.763
Come, come on.

01:17:17.682 --> 01:17:21.435
I try to stop them.
You stay at the machine.

01:18:14.322 --> 01:18:16.323
Who are you?

01:18:19.703 --> 01:18:23.163
I'm here
Klaus Listener to stop it.

01:18:23.248 --> 01:18:26.333
Unfortunately, only I am here.

01:18:28.211 --> 01:18:31.964
Would you destroy the machine?
Bring me to.

01:18:41.141 --> 01:18:46.979
Try using the electromagnetic
pulse. She thinks I'm stupid.

01:18:47.063 --> 01:18:50.024
She is stupid.
They must protect the core.

01:18:55.780 --> 01:18:59.575
Stop the heart never.
Klaus Listener's secret.

01:19:00.285 --> 01:19:03.328
That never stop. Never.

01:19:31.858 --> 01:19:36.403
They forced you to help them.
-- Make the field larger.

01:19:37.530 --> 01:19:41.992
Bring them to Dad.
-- I know all about you.

01:19:42.452 --> 01:19:46.246
You are not like them.
Help them please do not.

01:19:46.331 --> 01:19:49.083
Begging is weak.
I've tried.

01:19:51.336 --> 01:19:54.963
I have earned.
I was arrogant.

01:19:55.173 --> 01:19:59.885
I wanted to unite the fields
and know how God thinks.

01:20:01.096 --> 01:20:04.723
I deserve pain.
Pain is what I know.

01:21:02.323 --> 01:21:04.867
Bugger anyway.

01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:19.882
I do not understand.

01:21:19.966 --> 01:21:24.469
But I have no choice, I must
to a nuclear attack questions.

01:21:24.554 --> 01:21:28.056
The light signal of Team Alpha.
-- Ignore it.

01:21:28.141 --> 01:21:32.436
Wait with nuclear weapons, but make
that bunker to the ground.

01:21:42.488 --> 01:21:45.949
And this? Can I use it?

01:21:46.409 --> 01:21:51.330
Unusable. Klaus Listener's secret.
-- Please, I can not.

01:21:51.414 --> 01:21:55.167
I do not know it,
and I do not understand.

01:21:56.336 --> 01:22:00.839
Two days back I thought that
it was what they had done.

01:22:00.924 --> 01:22:03.759
That is not true, what matters ...

01:22:03.843 --> 01:22:08.055
is what they do.
There, in our world.

01:22:08.139 --> 01:22:11.141
The world consists of vibrating particles,
nothing else.

01:22:11.226 --> 01:22:13.352
No, there are people.

01:22:13.436 --> 01:22:17.606
Innocent people who die
what you wanted ...

01:22:17.690 --> 01:22:20.317
you hunted and has unleashed.

01:22:30.536 --> 01:22:35.332
If you do not help me now ...

01:22:37.043 --> 01:22:41.421
The love of power
is the demon of humanity.

01:22:46.678 --> 01:22:52.933
The heart drives him.
But the core is poetry.

01:22:54.978 --> 01:22:59.273
The Black Sun has built him.
Only they have the key.

01:24:58.726 --> 01:25:02.979
Gefeliciteerde you've just saved.
Where are the others?

01:25:03.231 --> 01:25:05.148
There somewhere.

01:25:05.233 --> 01:25:08.235
The rockets are fired,
the planes are coming.

01:25:08.319 --> 01:25:11.863
Why were they fired?
-- Accidentally. You learn from your mistakes.

01:25:11.948 --> 01:25:14.991
We have four minutes
this here is destroyed.

01:25:16.953 --> 01:25:18.537
On the ground.

01:26:23.728 --> 01:26:25.729
We must leave.

01:26:27.398 --> 01:26:28.648
Garnet.

01:26:33.779 --> 01:26:37.240
Come.
-- Right behind you.

01:29:28.412 --> 01:29:30.705
Here is command Zero.
-- Links Fri

01:29:30.790 --> 01:29:32.749
Certainly the statement.
-- Right Fri

01:29:32.958 --> 01:29:34.793
Attach over.

01:30:35.229 --> 01:30:37.147
Are you alone?

01:30:44.363 --> 01:30:47.741
The jets come.
We gotta go.

01:30:53.122 --> 01:30:57.959
Hopefully you very quickly.
Because this is really tight.

01:31:08.137 --> 01:31:12.265
Was it worth the trip?
-- Yes.

01:31:15.603 --> 01:31:17.645
But he did not make it.

01:31:33.829 --> 01:31:36.289
I'm sorry real Lena.

01:31:36.540 --> 01:31:41.127
In a war you can only one side
choose your own.

01:31:50.012 --> 01:31:55.058
ADOC, this is Dragon ...
-- 60 meters, to fall.

01:31:55.267 --> 01:31:57.602
Got it, now go to the goal.

01:32:49.154 --> 01:32:53.032
Give your status on Falcon.
-- We are approaching the target.

01:32:53.117 --> 01:32:56.578
Damn it.

01:34:09.485 --> 01:34:13.404
It is an honor for me
to meet you.

01:34:14.239 --> 01:34:16.991
What do you want?

01:34:17.242 --> 01:34:22.705
The question is more what you need,
is not it?

01:34:24.792 --> 01:34:28.294
I've always wondered myself
why he was not there.

01:34:28.379 --> 01:34:32.548
A man who would give everything
be there as the Empire rises again.

01:34:33.175 --> 01:34:35.218
Why was he not?

01:34:35.636 --> 01:34:40.890
The truth is that he could not.
He is weak, he is dying.

01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:45.395
Sure, you had a new machine
can build.

01:34:45.479 --> 01:34:52.485
But that one part
you could never recreate.

01:34:54.238 --> 01:34:56.489
Thus was it?

01:35:03.455 --> 01:35:07.250
You did not have to send Hunt.
Too many scruples.

01:35:07.334 --> 01:35:11.921
You have a lot
pragmatic someone.

01:35:13.257 --> 01:35:15.425
50 million seems reasonable.

01:35:16.176 --> 01:35:22.098
If you're thinking about me
to murder, you will notice ...

01:35:22.182 --> 01:35:25.601
that some essential elements
are missing.

01:35:27.271 --> 01:35:30.815
You were the plan, right?
Old creep.

01:35:34.570 --> 01:35:36.946
See it, let's say 60 million.

01:35:37.448 --> 01:35:41.367
Relax, you fuck like you.

01:35:42.369 --> 01:35:47.415
Hold on. Perhaps there
by more parties offered.

01:35:48.167 --> 01:35:50.877
And you want a bit of struggle.

01:35:51.336 --> 01:35:52.962
Surprise.

01:35:53.255 --> 01:35:58.760
Risen from the dead.
-- Yes, the bunker is indestructible.

01:35:59.261 --> 01:36:05.016
It was nothing personal.
As I said, I'm sorry.

01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:09.353
Was it true?
-- What do you mean?

01:36:09.813 --> 01:36:13.274
That they have more fun.

01:36:15.819 --> 01:36:20.114
I think you're right. There will always be
Klaus is a next Listener.

01:36:21.700 --> 01:36:25.620
He has a name on my list.
Now there are two.

01:36:26.622 --> 01:36:29.373
First I'm going after you.

01:36:30.375 --> 01:36:35.088
I wish you much success.
I made new friends.

01:36:35.756 --> 01:36:38.883
The war has widened,
young lady.

01:36:39.718 --> 01:36:44.263
What if we are behind you entering?
-- I will await you.
