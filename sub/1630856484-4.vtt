00:15.348 --> 00:16.558
<i>Griselda.</i>

00:17.350 --> 00:19.019
<i>We need to talk.</i>

00:19.644 --> 00:20.979
<i>Papo got Amilcar's territories.</i>

00:21.062 --> 00:23.314
<i>He doesn't want to be
in business with you.</i>

00:23.398 --> 00:26.317
<i>He already made a deal with Rafa.
I'm going with him.</i>

00:26.401 --> 00:29.863
<i>I told you I was gonna
fuck you back one way or another.</i>

00:35.827 --> 00:37.537
<i>I brought your dealers.</i>

00:37.620 --> 00:38.663
<i>You got nothing to give.</i>

00:38.747 --> 00:40.832
<i>Why didn't you
take the buyout?</i>

00:40.915 --> 00:42.876
<i>The door is that way, bitch.</i>

01:02.145 --> 01:03.730
<i>The truth is...</i>

01:05.607 --> 01:07.442
<i>you scare me more than they do.</i>

01:12.947 --> 01:15.617
<i>Some boats
are too rickety to make the trip.</i>

01:15.700 --> 01:17.869
<i>The State Department
has warned the boat operators</i>

01:17.952 --> 01:19.996
<i>they could be arrested
and given stiff fines.</i>

01:20.080 --> 01:21.706
<i>But still it goes on this morning.</i>

01:21.790 --> 01:25.668
<i>A ragtag armada of boats
traveling between Miami and Cuba</i>

01:25.752 --> 01:27.170
<i>to bring out the Cubans who say</i>

01:27.253 --> 01:30.507
<i>they can no longer stand
to live under Communist rule.</i>

01:30.590 --> 01:34.761
For too long, gangs of
drug dealers have held our city hostage,

01:34.844 --> 01:37.388
which is why today,
I'd like to announce the formation

01:37.472 --> 01:40.141
of a new federally-mandated CENTAC unit.

01:40.850 --> 01:43.895
This task force includes
local and federal agents

01:43.978 --> 01:46.564
and will be led by Detective Raul Diaz.

01:48.691 --> 01:50.151
Congratulations.

01:50.235 --> 01:52.195
Thank you very much. Jim, how are you?

01:59.786 --> 02:02.080
This is the house I told you about.

02:02.163 --> 02:05.583
We'll be here a few days
until I'm done fixing some things.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.961
-  What things?
-  Things.

02:08.628 --> 02:12.423
-  Think I saw an alligator.
-  What's with the new security?

02:12.507 --> 02:14.342
Just a precaution.

02:25.478 --> 02:26.938
This is Rigo.

02:27.021 --> 02:29.607
He and his cousins
came over on those boats

02:29.691 --> 02:31.484
from Cuba we saw on the news, Ozzy.

02:31.568 --> 02:33.278
They call us "Marielitos."

02:38.032 --> 02:39.033
Put them on.

02:39.117 --> 02:39.951
Thank you.

02:40.577 --> 02:42.912
Help unload the car.

02:43.663 --> 02:44.998
I gotta make a call.

02:49.335 --> 02:50.587
Rigo thinks your mom's a saint

02:50.670 --> 02:53.172
'cause she gave jobs
to him and his cousin.

02:59.804 --> 03:02.265
<i>Look at you. You're drunk too.</i>

03:02.348 --> 03:03.266
<i>Come on. Let's go.</i>

03:09.147 --> 03:09.981
Hello.

03:10.064 --> 03:11.357
<i>How's it going?</i>

03:11.900 --> 03:13.818
Just doing a deep clean.

03:13.902 --> 03:16.154
You mean getting high in the backyard?

03:16.237 --> 03:20.116
We need a "vacation," too.

03:20.199 --> 03:21.159
And?

03:21.868 --> 03:22.827
It happen yet?

03:23.995 --> 03:25.538
I haven't given the order yet.

03:26.915 --> 03:28.207
Listen to me.

03:28.791 --> 03:31.294
Back in the day,
when a man treated us like shit,

03:31.377 --> 03:33.463
all we could do was knee him in the nuts.

03:34.005 --> 03:35.465
Now you got the means,

03:35.548 --> 03:37.967
do not feel bad taking back what's yours.

03:38.718 --> 03:39.761
<i>What's going on?</i>

03:39.844 --> 03:42.597
She's gonna fuck up
the assholes who stole her territory.

03:42.680 --> 03:45.016
Fuck yeah, Godmother!

03:46.559 --> 03:48.770
Clean the house at some point, okay?

03:48.853 --> 03:50.730
Aye, aye, captain.

03:51.397 --> 03:52.232
<i>Good luck.</i>

04:09.874 --> 04:10.708
<i>Hello.</i>

04:12.585 --> 04:13.461
We're here.

04:15.213 --> 04:16.130
Get going.

04:25.890 --> 04:27.058
Who are these people?

04:27.141 --> 04:28.977
Must be the house owners.

04:29.060 --> 04:32.105
Rigo. Chucho.
Dario's en route. You should go.

04:41.656 --> 04:42.991
Where they going?

04:43.700 --> 04:45.660
Nowhere. Go get settled.

05:28.244 --> 05:30.413
- That him?
-  Mm-hmm.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.001
Party's on.

06:04.739 --> 06:06.240
No one comes out alive.

06:15.124 --> 06:16.584
You see what Castro's doing?

06:17.251 --> 06:19.003
Already enough Cubans in this town.

06:19.837 --> 06:22.090
They're like fucking roaches.

06:22.173 --> 06:24.050
- You want a beer, Dad?

06:24.133 --> 06:25.051
Yes.

06:48.074 --> 06:48.908
Die!

07:16.477 --> 07:18.354
Let's go.

07:31.909 --> 07:32.785
Whoo!

07:44.714 --> 07:45.548
Mom.

07:46.424 --> 07:48.676
Gosh, Ozzy, you scared me.

07:49.385 --> 07:50.887
Think I found the alligator.

07:51.429 --> 07:55.433
- Should you be looking for it?
- I'd like to watch it eat something.

07:56.767 --> 07:58.352
How long are we staying here?

08:00.062 --> 08:03.149
We should be home
in a couple of days, okay?

08:17.830 --> 08:18.664
It's done.

08:24.795 --> 08:26.923
Hey. It's over.

08:28.174 --> 08:29.800
- Shit is over.
-  Mm.

08:30.968 --> 08:32.845
You did good, my love.

08:38.476 --> 08:41.020
<i>An attack at a high-end shopping mall</i>

08:41.103 --> 08:42.313
<i>left two men dead today.</i>

08:42.396 --> 08:45.066
<i>The assailants abandoned
what police are calling a war wagon.</i>

08:45.149 --> 08:47.109
<i>We now go live on scene.</i>

08:47.193 --> 08:50.488
<i>Two shotguns,
three machine guns, five pistols,</i>

08:50.571 --> 08:52.907
<i>and a number
of flak vests were inside the van.</i>

08:52.990 --> 08:56.160
<i>Police spent more than an hour searching
the neighborhood for suspects,</i>

08:56.244 --> 08:58.079
<i>but weren't able to turn anybody up.</i>

08:58.162 --> 09:00.122
<i>The suspects are still at large.</i>

09:00.206 --> 09:02.792
<i>Police say they don't know
what the motive was for...</i>

09:04.710 --> 09:07.380
-  Fucking satellite.

09:10.299 --> 09:12.093
- Is it her?

09:12.176 --> 09:14.845
Griselda? The one you told me about?

09:14.929 --> 09:15.763
Yes.

09:15.846 --> 09:18.391
<i>They came prepared to do battle.</i>

09:18.474 --> 09:20.560
 <i>It's also
been reported across town</i>

09:20.643 --> 09:24.230
<i>a massive explosion destroyed
the house of this man, Papo Mejia.</i>

09:24.313 --> 09:25.314
Fuck, Papo.

09:25.398 --> 09:29.318
<i>They've not said it
was drug-related, but it's a possibility.</i>

09:29.402 --> 09:30.736
She's a headache.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.905
<i>...opened the liquor store,</i>

09:32.989 --> 09:34.907
<i>the dead men,
the victims are still inside...</i>

09:34.991 --> 09:37.034
She's a badass.

09:37.118 --> 09:40.329
<i>Authorities identified one of the victims.</i>

09:40.413 --> 09:42.373
<i>German Panesso,</i>

09:42.456 --> 09:45.126
<i>a Colombian national
suspected of drug trafficking.</i>

09:45.209 --> 09:48.838
<i>Panesso is believed to have been
the primary target of the gunmen.</i>

09:51.340 --> 09:53.050
Uh, right now, we have two--

09:54.302 --> 09:56.137
I heard about it already...

09:58.014 --> 09:59.432
Left it for a reason.

09:59.515 --> 10:02.268
Somebody's sending a message
they're not fucking around.

10:02.351 --> 10:03.394
Papo thing, too.

10:03.936 --> 10:04.770
Question is who.

10:05.896 --> 10:10.610
Our vic was a supplier from Medellín.
Name is German Panesso.

10:10.693 --> 10:11.944
Guess we could start there.

10:12.028 --> 10:15.281
We deliver a big arrest here,
make it public, reassure everyone.

10:16.741 --> 10:18.409
That's why we got CENTAC, June.

10:19.201 --> 10:20.161
All eyes are on us.

10:22.079 --> 10:24.165
You and I, we take this case together.

10:40.723 --> 10:43.476
You didn't have to come all this way.

10:43.559 --> 10:45.227
Come on, Griselda.

10:46.479 --> 10:49.649
You wanted me to come all this way.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.484
They took everything from me, Rafa.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.241
And I want it back.

11:00.409 --> 11:01.494
I get it.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.747
Can't say I like your method, though.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.458
- I tried talking.

11:07.541 --> 11:08.876
Not what I meant.

11:10.211 --> 11:15.341
You think blowing up someone's house,
you're gonna kill them.

11:16.300 --> 11:17.885
Most of the time, you're right.

11:18.719 --> 11:23.307
Problem is, sometimes,
your man's in the wrong spot.

11:23.391 --> 11:27.478
And when a wall caves in,
instead of crushing him, it protects him.

11:30.272 --> 11:31.107
That's right.

11:32.024 --> 11:33.192
Papo's still alive.

11:33.859 --> 11:37.238
And as far as I'm concerned,
he's still in charge of the city.

11:38.072 --> 11:41.617
So I'm not here to give you shit.

11:41.700 --> 11:44.078
Whose body were they talking about?

11:44.161 --> 11:46.747
Mmm. That's the best part.

11:46.831 --> 11:49.417
It was Papo's father.

11:50.042 --> 11:51.710
Christ, Griselda.

11:51.794 --> 11:54.797
You blew the shit out of the old man.

11:56.841 --> 11:59.760
That's why I came all this way. Hmm?

12:00.344 --> 12:02.972
I wouldn't miss for the world

12:03.055 --> 12:06.767
seeing that look
on your fucking face right now.

12:06.851 --> 12:09.186
This is a moment to savor.

12:11.689 --> 12:14.483
Papo's smarter than I thought.

12:16.694 --> 12:19.655
His man pulled him out
before cops arrived.

12:19.738 --> 12:21.866
And he let you think that you got him.

12:22.533 --> 12:26.203
I'm impressed by Papo.
Huh? Clever, Papo.

12:27.079 --> 12:30.124
And here you are, arranging flowers.

12:30.207 --> 12:32.501
Letting your guard down, I imagine.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.380
But don't worry. Relax.

12:36.464 --> 12:41.010
Nothing's going to happen to you here.
You got this place locked down.

12:41.093 --> 12:43.554
Papo won't come
all the way here looking for you.

12:43.637 --> 12:45.681
He's not an idiot. Don't be stupid.

12:46.599 --> 12:47.475
Hmm?

12:49.393 --> 12:50.978
But you know what I would do?

12:52.354 --> 12:55.816
I'd check your other shit right now.

12:56.901 --> 12:59.862
And then I would
get the fuck out of the city.

13:02.656 --> 13:04.617
Because if Papo doesn't kill you...

13:05.201 --> 13:06.035
Hey.

13:07.912 --> 13:09.121
Listen carefully.

13:09.705 --> 13:12.249
I might have to take you out myself.

13:12.875 --> 13:13.709
Both of you.

15:36.518 --> 15:41.023
They took down Amilcar,

<i>I'm glad you gave those assholes
what they deserve.</i>

15:49.281 --> 15:50.616
Where are you?

15:51.325 --> 15:52.242
California.

15:53.077 --> 15:55.454
Safer for me here.

15:56.330 --> 15:57.456
So what, Rivi?

15:59.041 --> 16:03.212
You just called me to tell me
you liked what I did?

16:05.589 --> 16:08.676
I go out in the heat every day here

16:08.759 --> 16:13.138
<i>and take this stuff
the Indians eat, peyote.</i>

16:13.222 --> 16:16.517
And I sit and think in this vast desert.

16:17.935 --> 16:19.186
But my mind...

16:21.188 --> 16:23.691
keeps coming back to you, Griselda.

16:23.774 --> 16:24.608
Me?

16:24.692 --> 16:26.068
<i>I'm not sure why.</i>

16:27.027 --> 16:30.072
<i>I think it's because you're the unknown.</i>

16:30.155 --> 16:32.616
This isn't about Papo or Panesso.

16:33.325 --> 16:36.704
<i>It's about that sky holding you down</i>

16:38.414 --> 16:40.332
<i>every day of your life.</i>

16:42.835 --> 16:44.586
<i>I told you I can help.</i>

16:45.170 --> 16:48.465
When you're ready, call me.

16:59.601 --> 17:02.396
Wait, hold on.
Can I get a light?

17:05.983 --> 17:06.817
Homemade.

17:07.776 --> 17:08.819
Likely in prison.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.030
He's a Marielito.

17:11.905 --> 17:15.242
The clerk at Dadeland
said the hitter had nice tats too.

17:15.325 --> 17:16.744
Could be another Marielito.

17:20.372 --> 17:21.206
Yeah.

17:22.332 --> 17:25.544
Which one out of the hundred thousand
that have come here so far?

17:47.566 --> 17:49.068
Miguelito's here.

17:51.528 --> 17:53.280
-  Thank you.
-  We're here.

17:53.363 --> 17:54.323
We're here.

18:02.039 --> 18:03.832
This is my aunt, Rigo's mother.

18:04.541 --> 18:06.418
I need to speak to Ms. Blanco.

18:07.377 --> 18:08.212
Please.

18:12.216 --> 18:14.301
I came here from Cuba years ago.

18:16.011 --> 18:19.848
But my son was in prison
for something he did very young.

18:21.433 --> 18:24.394
I waited and waited
until Castro let him come.

18:25.312 --> 18:26.522
And now

18:27.439 --> 18:29.024
I'll never see him again.

18:30.776 --> 18:31.985
I have sons.

18:33.237 --> 18:34.905
I can't imagine.

18:36.532 --> 18:41.411
Rigo said you're a mother to three boys,
but also to all who work for you.

18:42.621 --> 18:44.748
He said people call you the Godmother.

18:47.042 --> 18:49.962
So perhaps you know the answer.

18:52.172 --> 18:53.006
Tell me.

18:53.090 --> 18:55.134
They cut off my boy's head.

18:57.719 --> 19:00.639
Do you think he can still go to heaven?

19:04.393 --> 19:05.769
Yes, of course.

19:09.022 --> 19:10.983
Your son Rigo died because of me.

19:13.944 --> 19:16.405
You don't know how sorry I am.

19:16.488 --> 19:19.366
There's no one we can trust here.

19:21.827 --> 19:26.039
The police, the people in charge,
they're no different than those in Cuba.

19:26.123 --> 19:27.624
So many of these boys came here,

19:29.459 --> 19:31.086
but have nothing.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.005
Nothing to do.

19:33.088 --> 19:34.381
Nothing to believe in.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.134
You gave him that.

19:38.385 --> 19:43.557
If Rigo's brothers ever make it here,

19:43.640 --> 19:46.268
I hope they can work for you too.

19:49.563 --> 19:50.606
Let's go.

19:50.689 --> 19:51.815
Thank you.

19:54.234 --> 19:55.527
Esmerelda, wait.

19:57.362 --> 19:59.406
What if I can fix it for you?

20:00.949 --> 20:03.619
Make these men pay for what they did

20:03.702 --> 20:06.288
and give you the money
to bring your other sons here.

20:10.417 --> 20:11.501
You would do that?

20:13.378 --> 20:14.671
For you, anything.

20:23.597 --> 20:24.556
Hello.

20:24.640 --> 20:27.684
<i>Rivi, I need you to find me
Papo's sicario.</i>

20:37.903 --> 20:39.404
Why don't you let me do this?

20:42.074 --> 20:44.368
They have to know I did it myself.

21:23.699 --> 21:24.574
Hey!

21:26.118 --> 21:28.537
-  Leave me alone!

21:39.423 --> 21:40.257
Come on.

21:49.266 --> 21:52.144
Let me go! Let me go!

21:56.189 --> 21:57.024
In there.

22:04.948 --> 22:07.617
- Fuck you, bitch!
- Shut the fuck up!

22:08.702 --> 22:09.870
Hit him once. I can finish.

22:15.208 --> 22:17.544
Motherfucker, you're getting
what my friend got.

22:17.627 --> 22:19.004
And what my cousin got.

22:20.297 --> 22:21.548
Please don't kill me.

22:22.132 --> 22:23.800
Don't kill me. I beg you. Please.

22:24.384 --> 22:26.303
Let me go, please.

22:28.013 --> 22:30.265
Let me go, please.

22:31.266 --> 22:32.100
Griselda?

22:40.108 --> 22:42.360
Thank you. Thank you.

22:45.864 --> 22:47.324
Thank you.

22:52.120 --> 22:54.164
It's over. He's dead.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.000
Come on. We have to go.

23:32.702 --> 23:35.288
<i>Hey, take it easy.
This thing is sharp.</i>

23:35.372 --> 23:36.248
<i>Listen to me.</i>

23:36.331 --> 23:38.458
<i>- My wool won't keep you warm!</i>

23:38.542 --> 23:40.961
<i>- Well, it don't even keep me warm!</i>

24:15.871 --> 24:18.165
How the fuck do we keep up?

24:19.666 --> 24:22.544
He says he saw something,
but I don't speak Spanish.

24:30.510 --> 24:31.928
Sir.

24:32.012 --> 24:33.180
Did you see something?

24:34.389 --> 24:37.392
There were three,
but I didn't see their faces.

24:37.475 --> 24:39.895
I only know that one of them was a woman.

24:46.234 --> 24:47.319
There were more,

24:47.402 --> 24:49.821
but this was all that would fit
in the trucks.

24:51.323 --> 24:52.449
I got this for you.

24:56.077 --> 24:58.830
For them, you may want to wear it.

25:10.675 --> 25:12.636
Thank you all for coming.

25:14.846 --> 25:16.640
I'm Griselda Blanco.

25:24.022 --> 25:26.233
We both have the same problem.

25:26.816 --> 25:31.655
Every room I walk into, I'm just a woman.

25:31.738 --> 25:37.327
Every room you walk into,
you're just a Marielito.

25:39.913 --> 25:41.456
When people look at you,

25:42.123 --> 25:45.126
they only see your tattoos
and that you don't speak English.

25:45.752 --> 25:49.714
They think, "How can I use them?"

25:49.798 --> 25:51.549
"How can I abuse them?"

25:51.633 --> 25:55.303
The only way to get what we want

25:55.387 --> 25:59.349
is by taking it.

25:59.432 --> 26:01.601
Yes! Yes!

26:02.269 --> 26:04.604
And to do that, we need strength.

26:04.688 --> 26:06.439
Yes!

26:06.523 --> 26:09.025
- Strength in numbers and strength here.
-  Yes!

26:09.109 --> 26:10.402
Yes!

26:12.862 --> 26:19.786
I don't have to tell you
what I'll do for your families.

26:19.869 --> 26:22.247
- You've seen it.
-  Hmm.

26:22.330 --> 26:28.336
I don't have to tell you
I'll fight for you, you've seen it.

26:28.420 --> 26:29.629
Yeah! Together!

26:29.713 --> 26:33.300
What you need to know is,
if you work for me,

26:33.383 --> 26:35.719
you'll have a purpose,

26:35.802 --> 26:38.138
and you'll have respect.

26:41.057 --> 26:43.560
When we're done with this shit,

26:43.643 --> 26:47.272
you won't be washing their fucking dishes.

26:47.355 --> 26:52.235
You'll be sitting at their table,
eating their lobster,

26:52.319 --> 26:54.404
driving their Caddies,

26:54.487 --> 26:57.741
and swimming in their fucking pools.

27:02.203 --> 27:03.913
So who wants a piece of that?

27:06.166 --> 27:09.127
Let's go, my friends. Let's go.

27:09.878 --> 27:10.920
Let's go.

27:11.004 --> 27:12.339
The Godmother!

27:23.641 --> 27:26.227
She's got
an army of Marielitos, Papo.

27:26.311 --> 27:29.939
They're guarding her place
and the fences along the road.

27:30.023 --> 27:30.982
There's no way in.

27:31.608 --> 27:33.318
We can wait till she leaves--

27:33.401 --> 27:35.779
Why the fuck would
that bitch leave, Jacomo?

27:38.656 --> 27:40.700
She knows I wanna cut her head off too.

27:44.954 --> 27:47.165
Your yard
looks like a Cuban prison.

27:47.248 --> 27:48.917
That's her new army.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.961
I assume this has something to do
with why you want me to move in.

27:52.045 --> 27:54.255
I'm going to attack the Ochoa drops.

27:59.636 --> 28:01.429
You're going to war with the Ochoas.

28:01.513 --> 28:02.680
Not just them.

28:03.765 --> 28:05.600
Papo and his dealers too.

28:06.267 --> 28:09.604
Starting tomorrow,
I'm going to hit them all.

28:10.730 --> 28:12.399
Fuck up their operation.

28:12.482 --> 28:15.360
The Ochoas have
all that coke in the Bahamas,

28:15.443 --> 28:17.153
and will have nowhere to sell it.

28:18.029 --> 28:19.656
They'll give me what I want.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.491
Your territory?

28:21.574 --> 28:25.036
What's ours. We all worked for it.

28:25.120 --> 28:27.247
- You didn't see... No, listen.
-  But--

28:27.330 --> 28:28.623
You didn't see what I saw.

28:28.706 --> 28:32.085
Those assholes
aren't going to stop, and you know it.

28:32.877 --> 28:36.548
With the Marielitos here, we're good.
We don't have to run away.

28:37.966 --> 28:39.634
It's the only way, Arturo.

28:44.639 --> 28:47.142
Well, it's not like
I can go against the Godmother.

30:07.555 --> 30:08.640
Hurry up!

30:12.977 --> 30:16.898
They're wondering how you always know
where to send us, always a step ahead.

30:19.275 --> 30:22.946
Miguelito, I have a source.
But don't tell them that.

30:23.029 --> 30:25.532
I already told them
you have help from upstairs.

30:28.701 --> 30:31.079
To the Godmother! The Compassionate!

30:34.165 --> 30:35.917
Drink and get some rest.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.254
Tomorrow we'll hit
those motherfuckers again!

30:42.924 --> 30:46.261
Word is you can't even find
an eight-ball on the street.

30:47.679 --> 30:51.391
This should bring Rafa to the table.

30:54.102 --> 30:55.228
Godmother!

30:58.940 --> 30:59.774
Look.

31:00.775 --> 31:03.862
I think she's starting to like this shit.

31:12.245 --> 31:14.163
And that's intoxicating, my friend.

31:25.925 --> 31:28.469
I know
what she did to win them over.

31:34.392 --> 31:36.144
I hope I'm never like her.

31:36.728 --> 31:37.687
You won't be.

31:38.563 --> 31:39.772
You're not her.

31:40.690 --> 31:42.817
You come from a different place.

31:44.569 --> 31:46.654
I know there's a lot she doesn't tell me.

31:47.530 --> 31:48.865
She's just protecting you.

31:52.535 --> 31:55.788
Every fucking load
she takes out makes her stronger,

31:55.872 --> 31:58.625
and it stops our entire system
right when we were getting started.

31:58.708 --> 32:01.252
Papo, you are in charge of the city.

32:01.336 --> 32:03.421
You think I don't know that?

32:03.504 --> 32:05.089
What do you want me to do?

32:05.173 --> 32:08.051
There is no way in that place.
She's got a fucking army, Rafa.

32:09.385 --> 32:10.219
What?

32:10.303 --> 32:11.262
Hey.

32:11.763 --> 32:12.764
It's late.

32:13.556 --> 32:17.977
So, I was going through one of the purses
of the decapitated females at the house.

32:18.061 --> 32:20.355
- We assumed that they were prostitutes.
- Yeah.

32:20.438 --> 32:23.775
But I found these notes with numbers,
might be measurements in grams.

32:25.443 --> 32:28.529
Three and a half grams
is an eighth, 28 grams is an ounce.

32:28.613 --> 32:31.491
- Yeah, they're cutting kilos. Street sale.
- Mm-hmm.

32:31.574 --> 32:35.620
- Dealers usually hire somebody to do that.
- Exactly. But it wouldn't be a woman...

32:35.703 --> 32:37.914
- ...unless it's a woman doing the hiring.

32:37.997 --> 32:40.291
We had a witness
from our last homicide scene.

32:40.375 --> 32:42.377
He saw a woman, gave a description.

32:43.586 --> 32:45.254
You're still on this woman narco.

32:45.338 --> 32:47.090
I know you'll say, "What does it matter

32:47.173 --> 32:50.176
- if it doesn't help with the murders?"
- It doesn't relate to the murders.

32:50.259 --> 32:54.138
But if one of her employees was a victim,
then she's connected somehow.

32:54.222 --> 32:55.723
"She's connected somehow"?

32:56.432 --> 32:57.266
Okay, look.

32:58.977 --> 33:03.231
Red dots, single murders.
Blue, attacks by the Marielitos.

33:03.314 --> 33:05.608
Yeah, I see why people say
this is a war zone.

33:05.692 --> 33:08.695
Diaz. These attacks
on the Ochoa organization,

33:08.778 --> 33:10.071
they are not random.

33:10.154 --> 33:12.281
They are directed. Precise.

33:17.954 --> 33:22.333
Who's willing to systematically
go after the Ochoa organization?

33:23.835 --> 33:24.669
No one.

33:29.298 --> 33:31.884
Unless they have
the Marielitos working for them.

33:33.469 --> 33:37.306
We know that there are Marielitos who died
alongside those women at the house, right?

33:37.390 --> 33:38.266
Uh-huh.

33:38.349 --> 33:42.395
So it's not just women
that are working for my mystery narco,

33:42.478 --> 33:43.855
but it's Marielitos too.

33:44.605 --> 33:49.152
So I think that these attacks,
they are some kind of answer,

33:49.235 --> 33:52.739
they're some kind of retaliation,
for what happened at her house.

33:53.740 --> 33:56.034
You're saying that one person
is behind all of this?

33:56.117 --> 33:57.076
Yes.

33:58.453 --> 34:01.456
I'm saying one woman is behind all this.

34:07.712 --> 34:08.880
<i>Michael, is it true?</i>

34:11.340 --> 34:13.342
<i>Don't ask me about my business, Kay.</i>

34:13.426 --> 34:14.385
<i>Is it true?</i>

34:14.969 --> 34:16.888
-  <i>Don't ask me about my business.</i>
-  <i>No.</i>

34:16.971 --> 34:17.805
<i>Enough!</i>

34:21.059 --> 34:23.019
"Don't ask me about my business, Kay."

34:25.563 --> 34:28.232
-"Don't ask me about my business."
-  <i>All right.</i>

34:28.316 --> 34:30.651
-  Dario, shut up, man
-  "Enough!"

34:30.735 --> 34:31.819
<i>This one time.</i>

34:34.697 --> 34:37.158
<i>This one time,
I'll let you ask me about my affairs.</i>

34:37.241 --> 34:39.160
I'll be right back.

34:41.704 --> 34:42.538
<i>Is it true?</i>

34:46.209 --> 34:47.043
Mom?

34:48.127 --> 34:48.961
You okay?

34:50.797 --> 34:53.674
Just nerves. Go back to the movie.

34:57.053 --> 34:57.887
Nerves.

35:02.266 --> 35:03.184
That's not true.

35:06.479 --> 35:09.857
I let you lie
because I think it helps you.

35:10.650 --> 35:12.068
And I'm not sure it does.

35:14.695 --> 35:17.698
I do know it's starting to piss me off.

35:20.118 --> 35:23.871
I'm pregnant, Uber.
That's why I keep throwing up.

35:25.039 --> 35:26.916
Dario doesn't know.

35:33.339 --> 35:37.218
I remember the day I realized
my mother was full of shit.

35:39.512 --> 35:45.810
But the difference between her and I
is she lied to help herself.

35:46.936 --> 35:48.479
Everything was all about her.

35:49.897 --> 35:53.109
I need you to know that everything I do,

35:53.192 --> 35:54.819
I do for you boys.

35:56.154 --> 35:57.488
For the family.

36:01.200 --> 36:03.661
I want this to stay between us.

36:12.461 --> 36:15.089
This is where
they all come, the narcos.

36:16.174 --> 36:18.551
I got a CI in here, Monkey Morales.

36:18.634 --> 36:21.053
I mean, if anybody
knows about a lady narco,

36:21.929 --> 36:23.139
it's gonna be him.

36:23.764 --> 36:26.267
So, how does it work with this Monkey?

36:28.060 --> 36:29.187
We wait here.

36:30.813 --> 36:31.981
See if he can talk.

36:42.366 --> 36:44.076
- Can I ask you something?
- Mm-hmm.

36:44.160 --> 36:45.578
You close with your dad?

36:46.495 --> 36:47.663
My dad?

36:48.789 --> 36:52.501
My real dad put me and my brother on
a plane by ourselves to get out of Cuba.

36:52.585 --> 36:55.713
So, "Dad" is just a bunch
of drunk uncles that live here.

36:55.796 --> 36:56.631
Why?

36:59.425 --> 37:01.802
Uh, my boy, he wanted to go stay with his.

37:02.762 --> 37:04.263
Felt like he didn't know him.

37:05.056 --> 37:06.057
And you were hurt.

37:06.140 --> 37:07.183
Very.

37:07.725 --> 37:08.601
Hmm.

37:08.684 --> 37:12.521
But I figured he has to learn
for himself what an asshole the guy is.

37:15.942 --> 37:17.109
And maybe

37:18.486 --> 37:21.197
I needed him out of my hair
so I could do this new job.

37:23.282 --> 37:26.619
All right. There's no shame, you know.
You like what you do.

37:26.702 --> 37:29.580
No offense, Diaz,
but you're not a single mother.

37:30.498 --> 37:32.124
You think running CENTAC's hard?

37:32.208 --> 37:34.335
You didn't ask me
the right question, then.

37:35.753 --> 37:38.965
You see... [sighs] my mom,
I was very close to.

37:39.048 --> 37:42.802
When she made it here, she worked
and held me and my brothers together.

37:42.885 --> 37:43.886
Just like you.

37:48.099 --> 37:48.933
That's Monkey.

37:50.977 --> 37:51.811
All right.

37:52.728 --> 37:54.772
You're up. He's gonna see us.

37:56.607 --> 38:00.569
Do you know, or did you hear anything
about a woman narco?

38:03.739 --> 38:05.199
A woman narco...

38:07.576 --> 38:09.203
My height, brown hair.

38:09.996 --> 38:11.122
Pretty.

38:13.374 --> 38:16.043
So the woman cop's
after the woman narco?

38:16.127 --> 38:18.004
Answer the question, Monkey.

38:21.215 --> 38:22.091
Um...

38:23.968 --> 38:25.177
I don't know shit.

38:58.169 --> 39:01.213
Hey, you're a little obsessed
with the female narco.

39:02.131 --> 39:03.883
Maybe you're not seeing straight.

39:10.097 --> 39:13.225
- Hey. I'm gonna go sit this one out.

39:13.309 --> 39:16.145
You go back and say
I'm fucking stupid and make a joke

39:16.228 --> 39:19.231
about how female cops are
such a pain so you had me sit this out.

39:19.315 --> 39:21.859
- June, I don't wanna go back, okay?
- Just do it.

40:02.566 --> 40:04.318
So, Detective Hawkins...

40:06.278 --> 40:09.990
turns out Monkey saw your female narco
at the Mutiny several times.

40:11.992 --> 40:12.827
<i>Saw</i> her?

40:14.078 --> 40:16.038
Her name is Griselda Blanco.

40:37.017 --> 40:38.644
What's the problem?

40:47.069 --> 40:48.904
She hit more of our drops.

40:50.197 --> 40:51.282
She's acting crazy.

40:52.616 --> 40:54.160
Thinking about asking your cousin

40:54.243 --> 40:57.371
to send in
the heavy hitters on this bitch.

40:57.955 --> 41:01.542
You're gonna call the Ochoa army?

41:04.170 --> 41:09.008
"Die, all of you motherfuckers."

41:17.975 --> 41:20.060
'Course, then,

41:21.896 --> 41:23.856
you'll have to admit to my family

41:24.482 --> 41:28.402
that your Miami soldiers
got fucked by a woman.

41:45.628 --> 41:49.381
Rafa, I'm glad
you called. How's business?

41:49.465 --> 41:51.634
<i>What'd you do
with my coke, Griselda?</i>

41:52.510 --> 41:56.430
Don't worry. It's all here.

41:56.514 --> 41:58.807
<i>Okay. This is what we'll do.</i>

41:59.892 --> 42:02.269
<i>You're going to stop this bullshit,</i>

42:02.353 --> 42:05.397
<i>give me back the coke,
and I'll give you back your territory.</i>

42:06.065 --> 42:06.899
And Papo?

42:06.982 --> 42:09.151
Papo wants this over too,

42:09.235 --> 42:11.403
so he can go to Medellín, bury his dad,

42:11.487 --> 42:14.073
start making money again,
what's wrong with that?

42:14.782 --> 42:15.908
<i>As it should be.</i>

42:15.991 --> 42:21.080
Good. All I need is your word
that when he gets back,

42:21.163 --> 42:23.624
you two sit down and shake hands.

42:23.707 --> 42:25.918
I don't want any more bullshit in Miami.

42:31.757 --> 42:34.468
I told him he'd have
my answer in the morning.

42:34.552 --> 42:38.222
-  What is there to think about?
-  She doesn't want to stop.

42:38.305 --> 42:41.308
You already got him to concede,
which is unbelievable.

42:41.392 --> 42:45.479
Take the victory.
What do you have to think about?

42:45.563 --> 42:46.981
Give us a second.

42:58.075 --> 43:00.452
Was thinking I could
fix this place up a bit.

43:01.161 --> 43:04.123
Grow something in this place,
as long as we're stuck here.

43:09.211 --> 43:10.588
What's wrong, Dario?

43:10.671 --> 43:13.549
I thought this was just about
getting your territory back.

43:13.632 --> 43:14.466
It was.

43:15.759 --> 43:16.885
Now I'm not sure.

43:16.969 --> 43:19.138
Well, I think we should stop.

43:21.515 --> 43:23.392
Uber told you I'm pregnant.

43:23.475 --> 43:24.310
Mm-hmm.

43:25.144 --> 43:26.770
Question is, why didn't you?

43:27.396 --> 43:30.357
I was worried the second you found out,

43:30.441 --> 43:34.153
you'd just see me
as something delicate you had to protect--

43:34.236 --> 43:36.905
And that I wouldn't
let you take any more risks.

43:37.489 --> 43:40.492
I know who I'm with.

43:41.201 --> 43:42.995
I know the type of woman you are.

43:43.078 --> 43:46.832
I know you're a badass who doesn't quit,
and I fucking love that about you.

43:48.459 --> 43:51.920
I just worry
this shit's gone to your head,

43:52.004 --> 43:54.340
and you're not thinking straight.

43:54.423 --> 43:55.841
Not thinking about what's coming.

43:55.924 --> 43:58.677
Why? Hmm? Because I'm pregnant?

43:58.761 --> 44:03.515
Because you have an army of crazy Cubans
who'll do whatever you ask.

44:11.440 --> 44:12.483
This is ours.

44:13.942 --> 44:16.028
It's yours and mine. And it's beautiful.

44:18.989 --> 44:21.158
And I think
we just need to be more careful.

44:21.784 --> 44:23.744
Take your territory.

44:24.953 --> 44:26.330
It's more than enough.

44:28.248 --> 44:30.042
<i>How's the intel working?</i>

44:30.125 --> 44:32.795
Rafa gave me back my territory.

44:35.005 --> 44:37.341
<i>Hmm. But it doesn't feel right.</i>

44:39.176 --> 44:40.010
No.

44:40.928 --> 44:42.388
Your friend who died.

44:43.889 --> 44:44.890
What would she say?

44:47.351 --> 44:48.811
To keep fighting.

44:50.354 --> 44:51.480
But?

44:51.563 --> 44:53.982
<i>But she didn't have kids. And I do.</i>

44:55.150 --> 44:59.446
Feels like the more I fight
for them, the more I lose them.

45:00.781 --> 45:02.491
And now I'm pregnant.

45:07.579 --> 45:10.791
Bringing life into the world's
a big responsibility.

45:12.376 --> 45:13.460
<i>So is taking it away.</i>

45:16.255 --> 45:17.339
<i>When you're here,</i>

45:18.132 --> 45:21.218
<i>you can see
the big cycles of history, Griselda.</i>

45:22.219 --> 45:23.846
And you realize that time...

45:25.764 --> 45:27.391
doesn't move in a straight line.

45:29.017 --> 45:30.769
<i>It's a continuous circle</i>

45:31.854 --> 45:33.105
that doesn't stop.

45:38.944 --> 45:42.489
Very few can break the cycle.

45:44.992 --> 45:46.410
<i>What are you saying?</i>

45:46.493 --> 45:50.789
That I can't stop the Ochoas,
and that it's stupid to try?

45:51.665 --> 45:55.544
I'm saying you don't need advice from me.

45:59.756 --> 46:01.550
You know your own truth.

46:20.903 --> 46:23.780
We didn't do this for a mountain of coke.

46:25.491 --> 46:31.622
We did it so those motherfuckers
could feel how we feel!

46:31.705 --> 46:35.626
Powerless! Scared!

46:35.709 --> 46:36.793
Afraid!

46:36.877 --> 46:42.591
We're not done until those bastards
are on their knees,

46:42.674 --> 46:46.303
begging us to stop!

46:47.763 --> 46:48.597

49:07.361 --> 49:08.445
Sir.

49:09.071 --> 49:09.988
This just came in.

49:27.714 --> 49:28.548
Hello.

49:28.632 --> 49:32.594
MAY WE MAKE GOLD TOGETHER

49:33.470 --> 49:35.722
Sir. For you.

49:53.031 --> 49:53.865
Hello.

49:55.033 --> 49:59.162
I took your advice. No dynamite.

49:59.246 --> 50:02.708
This is fucking insane, Griselda.

50:02.791 --> 50:05.335
No, it was necessary.

50:06.128 --> 50:08.839
You got my gift? Read the inscription?

50:08.922 --> 50:13.385
I don't understand.
I gave you what you wanted.

50:13.468 --> 50:16.221
<i>Listen, asshole.
You gave me what was already mine.</i>

50:16.304 --> 50:18.557
I've let every dealer in the city know

50:18.640 --> 50:22.018
what happened to Papo will happen
to them if they don't do what I say.

50:22.728 --> 50:24.980
I want the city, Rafa. All of it.

50:25.647 --> 50:28.233
<i>So I suggest you go back to Fabio Ochoa</i>

50:28.316 --> 50:31.820
and tell him the cartel
doesn't sell an ounce of coke in Miami

50:31.903 --> 50:34.656
unless it's through me.

50:39.911 --> 50:42.622
You did this in front
of hundreds of witnesses.

50:42.706 --> 50:44.332
There's no way out for you here.

50:45.250 --> 50:49.963
Help us get Griselda, and we ask the DA
to make things easier for you.

50:54.885 --> 50:57.512
I will never say a fucking word.

51:13.904 --> 51:16.031
Dixon said
you wanted to talk.

51:18.074 --> 51:20.243
You always used to keep our secrets, Uber.

51:23.955 --> 51:26.166
I thought he should know.

51:33.757 --> 51:34.883
I understand.

51:34.966 --> 51:37.427
But next time, speak to me first.

51:48.605 --> 51:51.316
Things are going back
to how they were before.

51:53.944 --> 51:55.237
Better than before.

52:25.141 --> 52:27.310
I told you it'd all work out.

52:27.394 --> 52:28.228
Right.

52:29.354 --> 52:31.231
You always get your way.

52:38.864 --> 52:42.242
Our new family's going to have
everything it could ever need.

53:07.809 --> 53:10.562
Don't get too cocky, darling.

53:11.229 --> 53:12.606
He's upstairs.

53:20.447 --> 53:22.157
Please come in.

53:24.534 --> 53:27.579
Pleasure to meet you, Griselda Blanco.

53:28.872 --> 53:30.373
You must be Arturo.

53:31.291 --> 53:32.375
I'm Fabio Ochoa.

53:33.168 --> 53:34.961
The pleasure is all mine, Fabio.

53:35.045 --> 53:36.546
Please, sit.

53:43.178 --> 53:46.389
We've all been impressed
by what you've done here.

53:47.140 --> 53:49.935
No easy task to tame
these American shithole cities.

53:50.018 --> 53:54.940
So many egos, so many guns, and you...

53:56.608 --> 53:57.442
A woman.

53:58.693 --> 54:00.528
That's what you were going to say, Fabio?

54:06.993 --> 54:07.953
But here you are.

54:10.830 --> 54:11.957
Here I am.

54:20.090 --> 54:22.384
Rafa told me you want to be in charge.

54:23.009 --> 54:24.803
Yes. That is exactly what I want.

54:26.638 --> 54:28.473
So that's what will happen.

54:28.556 --> 54:33.353
Our Miami operation, our product,
will all run through you.

54:36.022 --> 54:42.404
You know, I've been impressed not just
by how industrious and clever you are,

54:44.239 --> 54:46.116
but also how ruthless.

54:47.450 --> 54:49.160
In this case, it was necessary.

54:49.828 --> 54:50.662
Yes.

54:51.788 --> 54:52.747
Sometimes it is.

54:59.421 --> 55:02.966
Of course, you must pay
for fucking with us.

55:04.384 --> 55:07.095
So it doesn't happen again. Understood?

55:20.316 --> 55:23.778
Now, let's get down to business.
