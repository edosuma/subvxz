WEBVTT

00:01.034 --> 00:02.969
GILES: Previously.
I love you.

00:03.003 --> 00:06.073
-Oh, my God.
-Here lies the warrior
of the people.

00:06.107 --> 00:08.976
Let her cross over.

00:09.009 --> 00:13.846
But I think I was in heaven.
I was torn out of there...
by my friends.

00:13.881 --> 00:16.082
-They can never know.
-GILES: We can't ignore
this kind of behavior.

00:16.117 --> 00:18.885
Something needs to be done
 before it spins out of control.

00:18.919 --> 00:21.021
BUFFY:
I'm glad you're here
to take care of it.

00:21.054 --> 00:23.157
-We're getting married.
-TARA: Congratulations.

00:23.190 --> 00:25.092
Willow, you are using
 too much magic.

00:25.126 --> 00:28.329
-Can we not do this now?
-Just forget it ever happened.

00:28.361 --> 00:29.763
Forget.

00:57.490 --> 01:00.561
(show-tune music playing)

01:07.234 --> 01:09.736
(alarm ringing)

01:40.533 --> 01:43.471
(ringing)

02:15.468 --> 02:18.138
* Every single night
the same arrangement *

02:18.171 --> 02:20.873
* I go out
and fight the fight *

02:20.908 --> 02:23.443
* Still I always feel
the strange estrangement *

02:23.477 --> 02:26.180
* Nothing here is real
Nothing here is right *

02:26.213 --> 02:29.616
* I've been making shows
of trading blows *

02:29.650 --> 02:33.853
* Just hoping no one knows
that I've been going
through the motions *

02:33.887 --> 02:36.389
* Walking through the part

02:36.424 --> 02:38.991
* Nothing seems
to penetrate *

02:39.026 --> 02:41.895
* My heart

02:41.929 --> 02:44.731
* I was always brave
and kind of righteous *

02:44.764 --> 02:47.735
* Now I find
I'm wavering *

02:47.768 --> 02:50.903
* Crawl out of your grave
you find this fight
just doesn't mean a thing *

02:50.937 --> 02:53.373
* She ain't got
that swing *

02:53.406 --> 02:55.975
* Thanks for noticing

02:56.009 --> 02:58.478
* She does pretty well
with fiends from hell *

02:58.512 --> 03:00.348
* But lately
we can tell *

03:00.381 --> 03:02.915
* That she's just
going through the motions *

03:02.949 --> 03:06.419
* Going through the motions
* Faking it somehow

03:06.454 --> 03:09.356
* She's not even
half the girl she--*

03:09.389 --> 03:12.058
* Ow

03:12.092 --> 03:14.495
* Will I stay
this way forever *

03:14.527 --> 03:17.431
* Sleepwalk through
my life's endeavor *

03:17.465 --> 03:19.832
* How can I repay--
* Whatever

03:19.866 --> 03:23.871
* I don't want to be

03:23.903 --> 03:26.606
* Going through
the motions *

03:26.639 --> 03:29.209
* Losing all my drive

03:29.242 --> 03:31.711
* I can't even see

03:31.745 --> 03:34.548
* If this is really me

03:34.581 --> 03:37.617
* And I just wanna be

03:37.651 --> 03:43.557
* Alive

03:51.932 --> 03:53.933
GILES:
Good morning, Buffy.

03:53.966 --> 03:56.870
Oh, hey. Did Dawn get off
to school all right?

03:56.903 --> 03:59.740
What? Oh, uh, yeah,
I think so.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.776
Respect the cruller
and tame the doughnut!

04:03.811 --> 04:05.812
That's still funny, sweetie.

04:05.846 --> 04:08.915
So, uh, no research?

04:08.949 --> 04:11.685
Nothing going on,
monsters or whatnot?

04:13.020 --> 04:15.688
Good. Good.

04:15.788 --> 04:18.992
Uh, so did anybody, uh,

04:19.026 --> 04:22.762
last night, you know,
did anybody, um,

04:22.795 --> 04:24.632
burst into song?

04:26.867 --> 04:28.401
Merciful Zeus!

04:28.435 --> 04:30.338
We thought
it was just us.

04:30.370 --> 04:32.439
Well, I sang, but I had
my guitar there, so--
 It was bizarre.

04:32.473 --> 04:34.908
We were talking.
Then it was like--
Like you were in a musical.

04:34.942 --> 04:37.577
That would explain
the huge backing orchestra
I couldn't see

04:37.610 --> 04:40.012
and the synchronized dancing
from the room service chaps.
 We were arguing.

04:40.047 --> 04:42.149
Then everything rhymed,
and there were harmonies

04:42.182 --> 04:44.317
and a dance with coconuts.
It was very disturbing.

04:44.351 --> 04:45.886
What did you sing about?

04:47.355 --> 04:48.822
I don't remember.

04:48.855 --> 04:51.124
But it seemed
perfectly normal.

04:51.158 --> 04:54.427
But disturbing and not
the natural order of things, and
do you think it'll happen again?

04:54.461 --> 04:57.129
-I don't know.
We should look into it.
-WILLOW: With the books.

04:57.230 --> 04:58.865
Do we have any
books on this?

04:58.899 --> 05:00.533
Well, we just gotta
break it down,

05:00.567 --> 05:02.302
look at the factors
before it happens again,

05:02.336 --> 05:05.271
'cause I, for one--
* I've got a theory
that it's a demon *

05:05.305 --> 05:07.940
* A dancing demon
No, something
isn't right there *

05:07.975 --> 05:10.478
* I've got a theory
Some kid is dreaming *

05:10.511 --> 05:13.279
* And we're all stuck inside
his wacky Broadway nightmare *

05:13.312 --> 05:17.617
* I've got a theory
We should work this out *

05:17.651 --> 05:19.720
* It's getting eerie

05:19.752 --> 05:25.292
* What's this cheery
singing all about *

05:25.324 --> 05:27.394
* It could be witches
some evil witches *

05:27.427 --> 05:30.029
* Which is ridiculous
'cause witches
they were persecuted *

05:30.062 --> 05:33.733
* Wicca good and love the Earth
and women power
and I'll be over here *

05:33.766 --> 05:36.536
* I've got a theory
It could be bunnies *

05:36.569 --> 05:38.672
(crickets chirping)

05:38.706 --> 05:41.509
-* I've got a--
-* Bunnies aren't just cute

05:41.542 --> 05:44.377
* Like everybody supposes

05:44.411 --> 05:46.814
* They got them hoppy legs

05:46.846 --> 05:49.348
* And twitchy little noses

05:49.382 --> 05:51.218
* And what's with
all the carrots *

05:51.250 --> 05:56.990
* What do they need such
good eyesight for anyway *

05:57.024 --> 06:02.194
* Bunnies, bunnies
It must be bunnies *

06:04.865 --> 06:06.567
* Or maybe midgets

06:06.600 --> 06:11.504
* I've got a theory
We should work this fast *

06:11.538 --> 06:14.408
BOTH:
* Because it clearly
could get serious *

06:14.442 --> 06:17.778
* Before it's passed

06:17.810 --> 06:19.747
BUFFY:
* I've got a theory

06:19.779 --> 06:23.716
* It doesn't matter

06:23.750 --> 06:28.721
* What can't we face
if we're together *

06:28.755 --> 06:32.893
* What's in this place
that we can't weather *

06:32.925 --> 06:34.927
* Apocalypse

06:34.961 --> 06:38.264
* We've all been there

06:38.298 --> 06:40.300
* The same old trips

06:40.332 --> 06:44.237
* Why should we care

06:44.271 --> 06:49.042
ALL:
* What can't we do
if we get in it *

06:49.076 --> 06:53.045
* We'll work it through
within a minute *

06:53.079 --> 06:55.649
* We have to try

06:55.682 --> 06:58.250
* We'll pay the price

06:58.284 --> 07:00.954
* It's do or die

07:00.987 --> 07:04.492
* Hey, I've died twice

07:04.524 --> 07:06.593
ALL:
* What can't we face

07:06.627 --> 07:09.663
* What can't we face
* If we're together

07:09.697 --> 07:12.231
* What's in this place
that we can't weather *

07:12.264 --> 07:14.334
GILES:
* If we're together

07:14.367 --> 07:17.637
* There's nothing
we can't face *

07:17.670 --> 07:20.273
* Except for bunnies

07:23.610 --> 07:27.247
See? Okay,
that was disturbing.
I thought it was neat.

07:27.279 --> 07:29.649
So what is it?
What's causing it?

07:30.817 --> 07:32.586
I thought it didn't matter.

07:32.620 --> 07:36.456
Well, I'm not
exactly quaking in my
stylish-yet-affordable boots,

07:36.490 --> 07:39.158
but there's definitely
something unnatural
going on here.

07:39.192 --> 07:41.894
And that
doesn't usually lead
to hugs and puppies.

07:43.831 --> 07:45.298
Well, is it just us?

07:45.331 --> 07:47.300
Is it only
happening to us?

07:47.334 --> 07:49.468
Because
that would probably
mean a spell.

07:52.973 --> 07:57.677
* They got
the mustard out *

07:57.711 --> 08:03.250
* They got
the mustard out *

08:08.689 --> 08:10.490
It's not just us.

08:12.860 --> 08:16.463
Oh, my God. You will never
believe what happened
at school today.

08:16.495 --> 08:18.865
Everybody started
singing and dancing?

08:20.500 --> 08:22.401
I gave birth
to a pterodactyl.

08:22.435 --> 08:25.338
Oh, my God.
Did it sing?

08:25.372 --> 08:28.507
-(whispering)
-So, you guys too, huh?

08:28.542 --> 08:31.110
-So what'd you sing about?
-Math.

08:32.211 --> 08:35.548
That's right.
The volume. The text.

08:36.616 --> 08:37.850
What text?

08:38.951 --> 08:40.653
The volumey text.

08:40.687 --> 08:41.922
You know.

08:43.289 --> 08:45.692
The (mumbles)
report.

08:45.725 --> 08:48.895
-The what now?
-There's just a few volumes

08:48.928 --> 08:51.831
back at the house
that deal with
mystical chants, bacchanals.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.701
-Might be relevant.
-Yeah, we could, um--

08:54.735 --> 08:58.572
I'm a hairsbreadth from
investigating bunnies at the
moment, so I'm open to anything.

08:58.605 --> 09:01.908
Great. We'll, um,
check it out, and, um,
we'll give you a call.

09:01.942 --> 09:05.177
Yeah. This could blow
the whole thing wide open.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.547
Do we have any books
at all at home?

09:07.648 --> 09:10.750
Well, who wants to be
cooped up on a day like this?

09:10.783 --> 09:14.754
The sun is shining.
There are songs going on.

09:14.788 --> 09:16.756
Those guys
are checking you out.

09:16.789 --> 09:19.359
What? Wh-What are they
looking at?

09:19.392 --> 09:21.394
The hotness
of you, doofus.

09:21.427 --> 09:23.296
Those boys really
thought I was hot?

09:23.330 --> 09:25.365
Entirely.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.967
Oh, my God.
I'm cured.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.437
I want the boys!
(chuckles)

09:30.470 --> 09:32.471
Do I have to fight
to keep you?

09:32.504 --> 09:34.441
'Cause I'm not
large with the butch.

09:34.474 --> 09:37.076
I'm just not
used to that.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.712
They were really
looking at me?

09:39.746 --> 09:42.215
And you can't imagine
what they see in you.

09:42.249 --> 09:45.251
I know exactly
what they see in me.

09:45.284 --> 09:47.386
You.

09:47.419 --> 09:51.290
* I lived my life
in shadow *

09:51.323 --> 09:56.062
* Never the sun
on my face *

09:56.096 --> 09:59.767
* It didn't seem
so sad though *

09:59.799 --> 10:03.770
* I figured
that was my place *

10:03.803 --> 10:08.140
* Now I'm bathed in light

10:08.174 --> 10:12.345
* Something
just isn't right *

10:12.379 --> 10:15.182
* I'm under your spell

10:15.215 --> 10:17.616
* How else could it be

10:17.650 --> 10:20.253
* Anyone would notice me

10:20.287 --> 10:23.456
* It's magic, I can tell

10:23.490 --> 10:25.491
* How you set me free

10:25.524 --> 10:28.928
* Brought me out
so easily *

10:28.961 --> 10:32.765
* I saw a world
enchanted *

10:32.799 --> 10:37.303
* Spirits and charms
in the air *

10:37.336 --> 10:41.274
* I always
took for granted *

10:41.307 --> 10:45.177
* I was the only one
there *

10:45.211 --> 10:49.515
* But your
power shone *

10:49.548 --> 10:53.821
* Brighter than
any I've known *

10:53.854 --> 10:56.956
* I'm under your spell

10:56.990 --> 10:59.192
* Nothing I can do

10:59.225 --> 11:01.794
* You just took
my soul with you *

11:01.828 --> 11:04.230
* You worked
your charm so well *

11:04.264 --> 11:06.298
* Finally I knew

11:06.332 --> 11:09.302
* Everything
I dreamed was true *

11:09.336 --> 11:15.075
* You make me believe

11:26.552 --> 11:30.490
* The moon to the tide

11:30.523 --> 11:34.927
* I can feel you inside

11:34.961 --> 11:37.831
* I'm under your spell

11:37.865 --> 11:40.200
* Surging like the sea

11:40.232 --> 11:42.870
* Pulled to you
so helplessly *

11:42.903 --> 11:46.173
* I break
with every swell *

11:46.206 --> 11:48.240
* Lost in ecstasy

11:48.274 --> 11:50.710
* Spread beneath
my willow tree *

11:50.744 --> 11:52.946
* You make me

11:52.980 --> 11:58.284
* Complete

12:02.322 --> 12:06.393
* You make me complete

12:06.426 --> 12:10.297
* You make me complete

12:10.330 --> 12:12.032
* You make me--*

12:12.065 --> 12:14.533
I bet they're
not even working.
Who now?

12:14.567 --> 12:18.038
Willow and Tara.
You see the way they were
with each other?

12:18.071 --> 12:20.774
The get-a-roominess
of them? I bet they're--

12:22.274 --> 12:25.577
Singing.
They're probably
singing right now.

12:25.611 --> 12:27.815
I'm sure Willow and Tara
are making every effort.

12:27.847 --> 12:30.283
Oh, yeah.
Xander.

12:30.317 --> 12:32.751
Buffy, it's okay.
I do know
about this stuff.

12:32.786 --> 12:36.322
Besides, it's all
kind of romantic.

12:36.355 --> 12:38.125
BOTH:
No, it's not.

12:38.158 --> 12:40.994
Come on.
Songs, dancing around.

12:41.028 --> 12:42.995
What's gonna be
wrong with that?

12:43.029 --> 12:45.365
(tap dancing)

12:47.801 --> 12:51.938
(whimpering)

13:01.981 --> 13:03.884
(screams)

13:09.489 --> 13:11.825
That's entertainment.

13:18.697 --> 13:20.267
XANDER:
You want some
breakfast, baby?

13:20.299 --> 13:22.970
You don't have
to go to work?

13:23.003 --> 13:25.172
No. I shut the crew
down for the day.

13:25.205 --> 13:27.274
My guys started
dancing around me.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.442
I don't know
if I could deal.

13:29.475 --> 13:34.447
It's a flab thing.
So, waffles?

13:34.480 --> 13:37.283
Will you still
make me waffles
when we're married?

13:37.317 --> 13:39.318
No, I'll only
make them for myself,

13:39.351 --> 13:42.154
but by California law,
you will own half of them.

13:44.224 --> 13:47.460
Hey, how about omelets?
I could do an omelet...

13:47.494 --> 13:50.797
* This is the man
that I plan to entangle *

13:50.830 --> 13:54.400
* Isn't he fine

13:54.433 --> 13:57.870
* My claim to fame
was to maim and to mangle *

13:57.904 --> 14:01.240
* Vengeance was mine

14:01.274 --> 14:04.644
* But I'm out of the biz

14:04.677 --> 14:08.315
* The name I made
I'll trade for his *

14:08.347 --> 14:11.985
* The only trouble is

14:12.019 --> 14:14.453
* I'll never tell

14:16.556 --> 14:19.558
* She is the one
She's such wonderful fun *

14:19.591 --> 14:21.693
* Such passion
and grace *

14:23.562 --> 14:26.198
* Warm in the night
when I'm right
in her tight *

14:26.232 --> 14:29.668
* Embrace
tight embrace *

14:29.701 --> 14:33.273
* I'll never
let her go *

14:33.306 --> 14:36.408
* The love we've known
can only grow *

14:36.442 --> 14:38.278
* There's just
one thing that-- *

14:38.311 --> 14:40.379
No.

14:40.413 --> 14:41.981
* I'll never tell

14:43.283 --> 14:47.955
BOTH:
* 'Cause there's
nothing to tell *

14:51.224 --> 14:53.360
* He snores
* She wheezes

14:53.393 --> 14:55.195
* Say "housework"
and he freezes *

14:55.227 --> 14:58.431
* She eats
these skeezy cheeses
that I can't describe *

14:58.465 --> 15:01.969
* I talk, he breezes
* She doesn't know
what pleases *

15:02.001 --> 15:05.138
* His penis got diseases
from a Chumash tribe *

15:05.172 --> 15:07.874
* The vibe

15:07.907 --> 15:12.245
* Gets kind of scary

15:12.278 --> 15:14.047
* Like she thinks
I'm ordinary *

15:14.081 --> 15:15.881
* Like it's all
just temporary *

15:15.914 --> 15:17.549
* Like her toes
are kind of hairy *

15:17.583 --> 15:19.586
* But it's all very well

15:19.619 --> 15:21.620
* 'Cause God knows
I'll never tell *

15:24.323 --> 15:26.725
* When things get rough, he

15:26.759 --> 15:28.394
* Just hides
behind his Buffy *

15:28.427 --> 15:30.062
* Now look
he's getting huffy *

15:30.096 --> 15:32.164
* 'Cause he knows
that I know *

15:32.198 --> 15:35.302
* She clings, she's needy
She's also really greedy *

15:35.335 --> 15:37.269
-* She never--
-* His eyes are beady

15:37.303 --> 15:39.471
* This is my verse, hello
She--*

15:41.508 --> 15:43.710
Look at me!
I'm dancin' crazy!

16:09.001 --> 16:11.971
* You know

16:12.004 --> 16:15.542
* You're quite
the charmer *
* My knight in armor

16:15.575 --> 16:17.710
* You're the cutest
of the Scoobies *

16:17.744 --> 16:20.679
* With your lips
as red as rubies
and your firm yet supple-- *

16:20.712 --> 16:22.315
* Tight embrace

16:35.861 --> 16:37.963
-* He's swell
-* She's sweller

16:37.996 --> 16:39.566
* He'll always
be my feller *

16:39.599 --> 16:43.036
* That's why I'll never
tell her that I'm petrified *

16:43.070 --> 16:45.172
* I've read this tale

16:45.272 --> 16:47.307
* There's wedding
then betrayal *

16:47.340 --> 16:51.077
* I know there'll come the day
I'll want to run and hide *

16:51.110 --> 16:53.245
* I lied

16:53.279 --> 16:56.716
* I said it's easy

16:56.749 --> 17:00.153
* I've tried

17:00.187 --> 17:04.057
* But there's these fears
I can't quell *

17:04.089 --> 17:07.594
* Is she looking
for a pot of gold *

17:07.626 --> 17:11.663
* Will I look good
when I've gotten old *

17:11.698 --> 17:14.433
* Will our life
become too stressful
if I'm never that successful *

17:14.467 --> 17:17.903
* When I get so
worn and wrinkly that I look
like David Brinkley *

17:17.935 --> 17:19.372
-* Am I crazy
-* Am I dreamin'

17:19.405 --> 17:21.540
* Am I marrying
a demon *

17:21.574 --> 17:24.344
* We could
really raise the beam
in makin' marriage a hell *

17:24.376 --> 17:27.247
* So thank God
I'll never tell *

17:27.279 --> 17:29.249
* I swear
that I'll never tell *

17:31.218 --> 17:33.051
* My lips
are sealed *

17:34.787 --> 17:36.888
* I take the Fifth

17:36.923 --> 17:39.259
* Nothing to see
Move it along *

17:40.492 --> 17:42.961
* I'll never
tell *

17:42.994 --> 17:46.432
(laughing)

17:46.465 --> 17:48.201
It's a nightmare,
a plague.
It has to be stopped.

17:48.234 --> 17:50.702
Like a nightmare about a plague.
It was like
we were being watched.

17:50.737 --> 17:53.373
Things just kept pouring out.
Like there was a wall missing
from our apartment.

17:53.405 --> 17:56.308
Like there were only three
walls-- My toes aren't hairy!
My eyes are not beady!

17:56.343 --> 17:59.112
Giles, you gotta stop it.
I am looking into
some leads and I--

17:59.145 --> 18:01.213
Of course!
Clearly our number

18:01.248 --> 18:03.950
is a retro-pastiche
that's never going to be
a breakaway pop hit.

18:03.982 --> 18:05.951
(woman singing)
Work with me,
British man.

18:05.984 --> 18:07.720
Give me an ax and show me
where to point it.

18:07.753 --> 18:09.422
My Xander, it's not quite
that simple,

18:09.455 --> 18:13.058
but I have learned about
some disturbing things...

18:13.092 --> 18:15.961
* I'm asking you
please, no *

18:15.994 --> 18:19.398
* It isn't right
It isn't fair *

18:19.432 --> 18:22.269
* There was
no parking anywhere *

18:22.301 --> 18:25.971
* I think that hydrant
wasn't there *

18:26.005 --> 18:28.607
* Why can't you
let it go *

18:28.641 --> 18:30.676
As in burnt up?

18:30.710 --> 18:33.512
Somebody set
people on fire?
That's nuts.

18:33.546 --> 18:35.847
I don't know.
One more verse
of our little ditty,

18:35.882 --> 18:38.116
and I would've been
looking for a gas can.

18:38.151 --> 18:41.788
Well, clearly,
emotions are running high.
But as far as I can tell,

18:41.820 --> 18:43.756
these people burnt up
from the inside.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.692
They spontaneously
combusted.

18:45.724 --> 18:47.859
I've only seen the one.

18:47.894 --> 18:50.797
I was able to examine
the body while police
were taking witness arias.

18:50.829 --> 18:52.999
Okay, but we're sure
that the things
are related,

18:53.031 --> 18:55.000
the singing and dancing
and burning and dying.

18:55.034 --> 18:57.135
We're not
sure of much.

18:57.170 --> 19:00.539
Buffy's looking for leads
at the local demon haunts.

19:00.573 --> 19:02.709
At least
in theory she is,

19:02.741 --> 19:05.511
but...
she doesn't seem to--

19:05.545 --> 19:07.547
She's easing
back into it.

19:07.579 --> 19:10.616
We pulled her
out of an untold
hell dimension.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.451
Ergo, the weirdness.

19:12.484 --> 19:15.121
The important thing
is to be there for her.

19:15.153 --> 19:18.590
I'm helping her as much
as I can, but, uh...

19:29.536 --> 19:32.003
The sun sets,
and she appears.

19:32.104 --> 19:34.540
Come to serenade me?

19:34.574 --> 19:37.644
So you know
what's going on.

19:37.676 --> 19:39.546
Well, I've seen
some damn funny things
the last two days.

19:39.578 --> 19:42.749
A 600-pound Chirago demon
making like Yma Sumac.

19:42.781 --> 19:44.817
That one'll
stay with you.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.919
I remain immune,
happy to say.

19:46.952 --> 19:50.623
-Drink?
-A world of no.

19:51.857 --> 19:54.527
So, any idea
what's causing this?

19:55.894 --> 19:58.865
Oh. So that's all.

19:58.897 --> 20:00.833
You've just
come to pump me
for information.

20:00.866 --> 20:03.569
What else would I want
to pump you for?

20:03.603 --> 20:05.571
I really just said that,
didn't I?

20:05.605 --> 20:08.039
Yeah, well,

20:08.074 --> 20:10.710
don't want to bore you
with the small talk.

20:10.742 --> 20:13.380
Don't know a thing.

20:14.614 --> 20:16.615
What's up?
You're all bad moody.

20:16.648 --> 20:18.651
It's nothing.
Glad you could stop by.

20:21.153 --> 20:23.055
It's nothing.

20:23.088 --> 20:24.123
What?

20:25.424 --> 20:27.794
* I died

20:27.826 --> 20:31.029
* So many years ago

20:31.063 --> 20:34.032
* But you can make me feel

20:34.066 --> 20:36.903
* Like it isn't so

20:36.935 --> 20:39.439
* And why you come
to be with me *

20:39.471 --> 20:42.642
* I think
I finally know *

20:42.674 --> 20:45.978
* Mm-hmm

20:46.011 --> 20:48.146
* You're scared

20:48.180 --> 20:51.451
* Ashamed
of what you feel *

20:51.483 --> 20:54.421
* And you can't tell
the ones you love *

20:54.453 --> 20:57.923
* You know
they couldn't deal *

20:57.957 --> 20:59.959
* A whisper
in a dead man's ear *

20:59.991 --> 21:03.962
* It doesn't make it real

21:06.633 --> 21:11.604
* That's great
But I don't wanna play *

21:11.637 --> 21:14.073
* 'Cause being with you
touches me *

21:14.105 --> 21:16.608
* More than I can say

21:16.643 --> 21:18.911
* And since I'm only
dead to you *

21:18.944 --> 21:22.914
* I'm saying stay away

21:22.949 --> 21:27.118
* And let me rest in peace

21:27.153 --> 21:29.087
* Let me rest in peace

21:29.121 --> 21:31.289
* Let me get some sleep

21:31.324 --> 21:36.261
* Let me take my love
and bury it
in a hole six-foot deep *

21:36.295 --> 21:38.197
* I can lay my body down

21:38.230 --> 21:42.300
* But I can't find
my sweet release *

21:42.335 --> 21:46.705
* So let me rest in peace

21:46.739 --> 21:51.478
* You know you got
a willing slave *

21:51.510 --> 21:53.480
* And you just love
to play the thought *

21:53.512 --> 21:56.048
* That you might misbehave

21:56.082 --> 21:58.617
* But 'til you do
I'm telling you *

21:58.651 --> 22:01.653
* Stop visiting my grave

22:01.688 --> 22:05.791
* And let me rest in peace

22:05.825 --> 22:10.296
* I know I should go

22:10.328 --> 22:15.367
* But I follow you
like a man possessed *

22:15.402 --> 22:17.303
* There's a traitor here

22:17.336 --> 22:19.806
* Beneath my breast

22:19.838 --> 22:24.242
* And it hurts me more
than you've ever guessed *

22:24.276 --> 22:28.515
* If my heart could beat
it would break my chest *

22:28.548 --> 22:33.318
* But I can see
you're unimpressed *

22:33.352 --> 22:35.488
* So leave me be

22:35.521 --> 22:37.690
* And let me rest in peace

22:37.723 --> 22:40.426
* Let me get some sleep

22:40.460 --> 22:42.694
* Let me take my love
and bury it *

22:42.729 --> 22:44.864
* In a hole six-foot deep

22:44.896 --> 22:46.598
* I can lay my body down

22:46.633 --> 22:50.436
* But I can't find
my sweet release *

22:50.470 --> 22:53.705
* Let me rest in peace

22:53.740 --> 22:55.708
* Why won't you

22:55.741 --> 23:01.212
* Let me rest in peace

23:09.121 --> 23:11.824
So, you're not
staying then?

23:16.563 --> 23:18.464
Lot of homework?

23:18.498 --> 23:20.398
Ah, math.

23:20.432 --> 23:23.435
It seemed cooler
when we were
singing about it.

23:23.470 --> 23:26.638
Willow said they have
a lead on the whole
musical-extravaganza evil.

23:26.673 --> 23:30.308
This demon
that can be summoned,
some sort of lord of the dance.

23:30.342 --> 23:33.579
Uh, but not the scary one.
Just a demon.

23:33.613 --> 23:37.048
Um, do they know
who summoned it?

23:37.083 --> 23:39.786
They don't even know
its name yet,
but Willow will find out.

23:39.818 --> 23:41.953
She's the brainy type.

23:41.988 --> 23:44.289
I'm glad
you guys made up.

23:44.323 --> 23:45.825
What?

23:45.857 --> 23:48.728
That fight you guys had
about magic and stuff?

23:48.760 --> 23:52.230
It gives me
belly rumblings
when you guys fight.

23:52.263 --> 23:54.400
Dawn, Willow and I
never fought about--

23:54.432 --> 23:57.068
It's okay. It's just--

23:57.103 --> 23:59.739
You guys are
so great together.

23:59.771 --> 24:02.008
I just hate it
when you--

24:02.040 --> 24:06.112
But that was
the only fight I've seen
you guys have anyway.

24:06.144 --> 24:07.980
But I'm still
glad it's over.

24:10.016 --> 24:11.250
Dawn, I, um--

24:11.282 --> 24:13.451
There's something
I need at the shop.

24:13.486 --> 24:16.087
Will you be okay
for a little while?

24:16.122 --> 24:20.492
Yes. The 15 year old
can spend half an hour
alone in her locked house.

24:20.527 --> 24:22.161
I-I won't be gone long.

24:56.828 --> 25:01.366
* Does anybody
even notice *

25:04.871 --> 25:10.142
* Does anybody
even care *

25:10.175 --> 25:12.443
(screaming)

25:19.586 --> 25:22.855
(ballet music playing)

26:45.371 --> 26:47.239
* Why'd you run away

26:47.272 --> 26:51.277
* Don't you like my style

26:51.309 --> 26:53.345
Ah!

26:53.378 --> 26:55.781
* Why don't you come and play

26:55.815 --> 27:01.019
* I guarantee
 a great big smile *

27:01.053 --> 27:04.757
* I come from
the imagination *

27:04.790 --> 27:08.827
* And I'm here strictly
by your invocation *

27:08.861 --> 27:11.262
* So what do you say

27:11.297 --> 27:14.232
* Why don't we dance a while

27:17.502 --> 27:19.471
* I'm the heart of swing

27:19.505 --> 27:23.875
* I'm the twist and shout

27:25.176 --> 27:27.313
* When you gotta sing

27:27.346 --> 27:32.651
* When you gotta
let it out *

27:32.684 --> 27:36.622
* You call me
and I come a-runnin' *

27:36.654 --> 27:38.523
* I turn the music on

27:38.557 --> 27:40.625
* I bring the fun in

27:40.659 --> 27:43.295
* Now we're partying

27:43.328 --> 27:48.034
* That's what
it's all about *
(chuckles)

27:48.067 --> 27:50.236
* 'Cause I know

27:50.269 --> 27:54.039
* What you feel, girl

27:55.907 --> 27:59.644
* I know just what

27:59.677 --> 28:02.749
* You feel, girl

28:02.781 --> 28:06.952
So you're like a good demon
bringing the fun in?

28:08.386 --> 28:12.023
* All these melodies
they go on *

28:12.057 --> 28:14.226
* Too long

28:14.259 --> 28:16.394
Ah.

28:16.428 --> 28:20.900
* Then that energy
starts to come on *

28:20.932 --> 28:23.935
* Way too strong

28:23.970 --> 28:28.374
* All those hearts lay open
That must sting *

28:28.406 --> 28:32.243
* Plus some customers
just start combusting *

28:32.278 --> 28:37.449
* That's the penalty
when life is but a song *

28:37.482 --> 28:39.684
Ah.

28:39.718 --> 28:43.756
* You brought me down
and doomed this town *

28:43.789 --> 28:47.558
* So when we blow
this scene *

28:47.593 --> 28:52.364
* Back we will go
to my kingdom below *

28:52.397 --> 28:56.301
* And you will
be my queen *

28:56.335 --> 28:59.637
* 'Cause I know
what you feel, girl *

28:59.671 --> 29:03.942
* No, you see
you and me
wouldn't be very regal *

29:03.976 --> 29:07.880
* I'll make it real, girl

29:07.913 --> 29:12.317
* What I mean, I'm 15, so this
queen thing's illegal *

29:12.351 --> 29:16.087
* I can bring
whole cities to ruin *

29:16.122 --> 29:19.424
* And still have time
to get a soft-shoe in *

29:19.458 --> 29:21.426
* Well, that's great
but I'm late *

29:21.460 --> 29:23.930
* And I'd hate to delay her

29:23.962 --> 29:27.900
* Something's cooking
I'm at the griddle *

29:27.933 --> 29:31.569
* I bought Nero
his very first fiddle *

29:31.603 --> 29:33.471
* She'll get pissed
if I'm missed *

29:33.505 --> 29:36.075
* See, my sister's
the Slayer *

29:36.107 --> 29:38.477
The Slayer?

29:38.509 --> 29:40.846
Yeah-huh.
(chuckles)

29:40.880 --> 29:45.351
Find her. Tell her--
Tell her everything.

29:45.384 --> 29:47.419
Just get her here.

29:47.452 --> 29:49.855
I wanna see the Slayer burn.

29:51.057 --> 29:53.291
* Now we're partying

29:53.325 --> 29:58.830
* That's what it's all about *

29:58.865 --> 30:00.932
(grunts)

30:00.967 --> 30:03.102
Good. Good.

30:03.134 --> 30:05.938
I feel like I should bow
or have honor or something.

30:05.971 --> 30:08.173
(sighs)
It may seem hokey,
but we need to work on

30:08.207 --> 30:10.608
precision and concentration
as much as power.

30:10.642 --> 30:12.644
We're still not sure
what we're facing.

30:12.678 --> 30:16.048
Oh, you'll figure it out.
I'm just worried this whole
session's gonna turn into

30:16.082 --> 30:18.884
some training montage
from an '80s movie.

30:18.917 --> 30:21.887
Well, if we hear any
inspirational power chords,

30:21.921 --> 30:24.190
we'll just lie down
till they go away.

30:24.222 --> 30:28.294
Anyway, I don't think we need to
work that much on your strength.

30:28.326 --> 30:30.930
Yeah. I'm pretty spry
for a corpse.

30:33.832 --> 30:36.835
Have you spoken to Dawn
about that incident
at Halloween?

30:39.438 --> 30:42.273
Oh. I thought
you took care of that.

30:43.575 --> 30:44.710
Right.

30:44.742 --> 30:46.577
What would I do
without you?

30:48.513 --> 30:51.250
Okay, I'm ready.

30:52.884 --> 30:58.690
* You're not ready
for the world outside *

30:58.723 --> 31:04.063
* You keep pretending
but you just can't hide *

31:04.096 --> 31:09.535
* I know I said that I'd
be standing by your side *

31:09.567 --> 31:11.938
* But I

31:16.241 --> 31:20.546
* Your path's unbeaten
and it's all uphill *

31:22.480 --> 31:28.054
* And you can meet it
but you never will *

31:28.086 --> 31:32.458
* And I'm the reason
that you're standing still *

31:32.490 --> 31:34.961
* But I

31:37.762 --> 31:42.134
* I wish I could say
the right words *

31:42.167 --> 31:44.069
* To lead you
through this land *

31:44.103 --> 31:47.905
* Wish I could play the father

31:47.940 --> 31:49.907
* And take you by the hand

31:49.942 --> 31:53.945
* Wish I could stay

31:53.980 --> 31:56.647
* But now I understand

31:56.682 --> 32:01.653
* I'm standing
in the way *

32:03.654 --> 32:09.461
* The cries around you
you don't hear at all *

32:09.494 --> 32:15.433
* 'Cause you know I'm here
to take that call *

32:15.467 --> 32:20.672
* So you just lie there when
you should be standing tall *

32:20.705 --> 32:22.840
* But I

32:25.111 --> 32:29.480
* I wish I could
lay your arms down *

32:29.515 --> 32:31.817
* And let you rest at last

32:31.849 --> 32:35.520
* Wish I could
slay your demons *

32:35.554 --> 32:37.689
* But now that time has passed

32:37.722 --> 32:41.093
* Wish I could stay

32:41.126 --> 32:44.262
* Your stalwart standing fast

32:44.296 --> 32:50.269
* But I'm standing
in the way *

32:50.301 --> 32:55.941
* I'm just standing
in the way **

32:55.973 --> 32:58.544
Did you just
say something?

33:08.753 --> 33:13.025
* I'm under your spell

33:13.058 --> 33:15.727
* God, how can this be

33:15.760 --> 33:19.397
* Playing with my memory

33:19.431 --> 33:23.402
* You know
I've been through hell *

33:23.434 --> 33:25.371
* Willow, don't you see

33:25.403 --> 33:29.641
* There'll be nothing
left of me *

33:29.674 --> 33:32.510
* You made me believe

33:32.544 --> 33:38.084
* Believe me
I don't wanna go *

33:39.785 --> 33:42.488
* And it'll grieve me

33:42.520 --> 33:46.525
-* 'Cause I love you so
-(no audible dialogue)

33:46.557 --> 33:50.496
* But we both know

33:50.528 --> 33:55.567
-* Wish I could
say the right words *
-* Wish I could trust

33:55.601 --> 33:58.403
* That it was just this once
* To lead you
through this land *

33:58.436 --> 34:01.406
* But I must do what I must
* Wish I could
play the father *

34:01.440 --> 34:04.210
* I can't adjust to this disgust
We're done and I just *
* And take you by the hand

34:04.242 --> 34:08.313
BOTH:
* Wish I could stay

34:11.317 --> 34:16.722
* Wish I could stay

34:18.324 --> 34:23.960
* Wish I could stay

34:25.764 --> 34:31.570
* Wish I could stay

34:34.172 --> 34:38.809
-(door opens)
-Looky-looky what I found.

34:38.844 --> 34:41.146
-Is this the demon guy?
-Tara.

34:41.179 --> 34:43.248
SPIKE:
Works for him.

34:43.282 --> 34:46.652
Has a nice little story
for the Slayer, don't you?

34:46.684 --> 34:50.621
Come on, then.
Sing.

34:50.655 --> 34:52.590
(orchestra intro)

34:52.623 --> 34:54.592
(stops)

34:54.626 --> 34:58.496
My master has the Slayer's
sister hostage at The Bronze
because she summoned him,

34:58.530 --> 35:01.300
and at midnight, he's going
to take her to the underworld
to be his queen.

35:01.333 --> 35:03.335
What does he want?

35:03.369 --> 35:04.769
Her.

35:04.802 --> 35:07.838
(scoffs) If that's all
you've got to say then--

35:11.277 --> 35:14.512
Strong. Someday
he'll be a real boy.

35:15.514 --> 35:17.949
So, Dawn's in trouble.

35:17.983 --> 35:21.186
-Must be Tuesday.
-I just left her
for a few minutes.

35:21.219 --> 35:24.190
Oh, it's not your fault.
So what's the plan?

35:24.222 --> 35:26.492
Plan schman.
Let's mount up.

35:26.525 --> 35:28.793
No.

35:28.827 --> 35:31.297
Dawn may have had the wrong idea
in summoning this creature,

35:31.329 --> 35:34.266
but I've seen some of these
underworld child-bride deals.

35:34.300 --> 35:37.202
And they never end well.
Well, maybe once.

35:37.235 --> 35:39.103
We're not just
gonna stay here.

35:39.137 --> 35:41.572
Yes, we are.

35:42.740 --> 35:44.510
Buffy's going alone.

35:44.543 --> 35:48.880
(scoffs) Don't be
a stupid git. There is--

35:48.914 --> 35:50.981
If I want your opinion,
Spike, I'll--

35:51.016 --> 35:52.884
I'll never want
your opinion.

35:54.320 --> 35:56.887
A little
confusion spell could--
No!

35:56.922 --> 35:59.891
I mean, I don't think
it'll help.

35:59.925 --> 36:02.126
Forget them, Slayer.
I got your back.

36:02.159 --> 36:05.063
Thought you wanted me
to stay away from you.

36:05.096 --> 36:07.798
Isn't that
what you sang?

36:07.833 --> 36:09.835
Spike sing a wittle song?

36:09.867 --> 36:11.670
Would you say it was
a breakaway pop hit

36:11.702 --> 36:13.672
or more of a book number?
Let it go, sweetie.

36:13.704 --> 36:17.576
Fine. I hope you dance
'til you burn.

36:17.608 --> 36:19.510
You and the little bit.

36:26.284 --> 36:28.286
You're really not coming.

36:29.454 --> 36:31.657
It's up to you, Buffy.

36:31.690 --> 36:34.925
-What do you expect me to do?
-Your best.

36:46.103 --> 36:51.777
* I touch the fire
and it freezes me *

36:51.809 --> 36:55.280
* I look into it
and it's black *

36:57.248 --> 36:59.751
* Why can't I feel

36:59.784 --> 37:02.521
* My skin should
crack and peel *

37:02.554 --> 37:05.990
* I want the fire back

37:08.260 --> 37:13.197
* Now through the smoke
she calls to me *

37:13.231 --> 37:18.135
* To make my way
across the flame *

37:18.168 --> 37:23.275
* To save the day
or maybe melt away *

37:23.309 --> 37:26.411
* I guess it's all the same

37:26.445 --> 37:32.451
* So I will walk
through the fire *

37:32.483 --> 37:36.588
* 'Cause where else
can I turn *

37:36.621 --> 37:40.626
* I will walk
through the fire *

37:40.659 --> 37:42.728
* And let it--

37:42.760 --> 37:47.798
* The torch I bear
is scorching me *

37:47.833 --> 37:50.802
* Buffy's laughing
I've no doubt *

37:52.471 --> 37:57.309
* I hope she fries
I'm free if that bitch dies *

37:57.342 --> 38:00.311
* I better help her out

38:00.346 --> 38:05.583
* 'Cause she is drawn
to the fire *

38:05.617 --> 38:09.920
-* Some people never learn
-* She will never learn

38:09.954 --> 38:14.960
BOTH:
* And she will
walk through the fire *

38:14.992 --> 38:16.094
* And let it--

38:16.126 --> 38:18.664
* Will this do a thing
to change her *

38:18.697 --> 38:21.166
* Am I leaving Dawn
in danger *

38:21.199 --> 38:25.536
* Is my Slayer
too far gone to care *

38:25.570 --> 38:27.873
* What if Buffy
can't defeat it *

38:27.905 --> 38:30.376
* Beady Eyes is right
We're needed *

38:30.409 --> 38:34.612
* Or we could just
sit around and glare *

38:34.646 --> 38:36.681
ALL:
* We'll see it through

38:36.715 --> 38:38.949
* It's what we're
always here to do *

38:38.983 --> 38:44.556
* So we will walk
through the fire *

38:44.590 --> 38:49.360
* So one by one
they turn from me *

38:49.394 --> 38:52.163
* I guess my friends
can't face the cold *

38:52.197 --> 38:54.565
* What can't we face

38:54.599 --> 38:58.637
* But why I froze
not one among them knows *
* If we're together

38:58.670 --> 39:03.474
* And never can be told

39:03.509 --> 39:05.811
* She came from the grave
much graver *
* So one by one

39:05.844 --> 39:08.246
* First he'll kill her,
then I'll save her *
* They come to me

39:08.278 --> 39:10.748
* Everything is turning out
so dark *
* The distant redness

39:10.782 --> 39:12.818
* Going through
the motions *
* As their guide

39:12.851 --> 39:14.985
* No, I'll save her,
then I'll kill her *
* That single flame

39:15.019 --> 39:18.188
* I think this line's
mostly filler *
* Ain't what they had in mind

39:18.222 --> 39:22.360
* What's it going to take
to strike a spark *
* It's what they have inside

39:22.393 --> 39:26.097
* These endless days are
finally ending in a blaze *
* She will come

39:26.130 --> 39:31.202
* To me
* ALL: And we are
caught in the fire *

39:31.235 --> 39:34.204
* The point of no return

39:34.239 --> 39:39.043
* So we will walk
through the fire *

39:39.077 --> 39:43.581
* And let it burn

39:43.614 --> 39:48.186
* Let it burn

39:48.219 --> 39:52.458
* Let it burn

39:52.490 --> 39:55.594
* Let it burn

39:55.626 --> 39:57.996
Show time.

40:05.836 --> 40:08.106
I love a good entrance.

40:08.139 --> 40:10.275
How are you
with death scenes?

40:10.307 --> 40:12.077
(chuckles)

40:12.110 --> 40:16.246
You got a name?
I've got 100.

40:16.280 --> 40:20.318
Well, I ought to know
what to call you if you're
gonna be my brother-in-law.

40:20.351 --> 40:22.387
Buffy, I swear I didn't do it.

40:22.420 --> 40:26.090
Don't worry.
You're not going anywhere.

40:26.123 --> 40:27.992
-I am.
-What?

40:28.025 --> 40:31.797
Deal's this:
I can't kill you,

40:31.829 --> 40:34.264
you take me to Hellsville
in her place.

40:34.298 --> 40:36.266
(chuckles)
What if I kill you?

40:36.300 --> 40:39.471
Trust me, won't help.

40:39.505 --> 40:42.940
-Hmm, that's gloomy.
-That's life.

40:42.974 --> 40:47.077
Come now. Is that
really what you feel?

40:47.112 --> 40:49.648
Isn't life a miraculous thing?

40:49.681 --> 40:52.483
I think you already know.

40:52.518 --> 40:54.318
* Life's a show

40:54.351 --> 40:58.657
* And we all play our parts

40:58.690 --> 41:02.427
* And when the music starts

41:02.460 --> 41:07.132
* We open up our hearts

41:07.164 --> 41:12.302
* It's all right if some things
come out wrong *

41:12.336 --> 41:16.041
* We'll sing a happy song

41:16.074 --> 41:20.778
* And you can sing along

41:20.811 --> 41:23.313
* Where there's life
there's hope *

41:23.347 --> 41:26.552
* Every day's a gift
Wishes can come true *

41:26.585 --> 41:30.155
* Whistle while you work
so hard all day *

41:30.188 --> 41:33.824
* To be like other girls

41:33.858 --> 41:38.563
* To fit in
in this glittering world *

41:40.164 --> 41:42.634
* Don't give me songs

41:42.668 --> 41:45.235
She needs backup.
Anya, Tara.

41:45.269 --> 41:49.206
* Don't give me songs

41:49.239 --> 41:53.344
* Give me something
to sing about *

41:53.378 --> 41:59.416
(vocalizing)

41:59.449 --> 42:04.255
* I need something
to sing about *

42:04.289 --> 42:09.027
(vocalizing)

42:15.766 --> 42:21.239
* Life's a song
you don't get to rehearse *

42:21.271 --> 42:24.775
* And every single verse

42:24.809 --> 42:29.347
* Can make it
that much worse *

42:29.380 --> 42:34.452
* Still my friends
don't know why I ignore *

42:34.485 --> 42:38.923
* The million things or more

42:38.956 --> 42:43.393
* I should be dancing for

42:43.427 --> 42:47.431
* All the joy life sends
family and friends *

42:47.465 --> 42:51.369
* All the twists and bends
knowing that it ends *

42:51.402 --> 42:56.742
* Well, that depends
on if they let you go *

42:56.775 --> 43:01.847
* On if they know
enough to know *

43:03.081 --> 43:06.652
* That when you've bowed

43:06.684 --> 43:10.922
* You leave the crowd

43:22.800 --> 43:25.936
* There was no pain

43:25.971 --> 43:28.172
* No fear, no doubt

43:28.206 --> 43:31.076
* 'Til they pulled me out

43:31.108 --> 43:33.543
* Of heaven

43:36.882 --> 43:39.349
* So that's my refrain

43:39.384 --> 43:42.253
* I live in hell

43:42.286 --> 43:44.822
* 'Cause I've been expelled

43:44.856 --> 43:47.291
* From heaven

43:48.393 --> 43:52.030
* I think I was in heaven

43:54.065 --> 43:59.336
* So give me something
to sing about *

44:02.673 --> 44:06.643
* Please give me something

44:28.733 --> 44:31.036
(sizzling)

44:36.206 --> 44:38.342
* Life's not a song

44:39.677 --> 44:42.313
* Life isn't bliss

44:42.347 --> 44:44.750
* Life is just this

44:44.782 --> 44:48.119
* It's living

44:51.588 --> 44:55.525
* You'll get along

44:55.559 --> 45:00.264
* The pain that you feel
you only can heal *

45:00.297 --> 45:04.835
* By living

45:04.869 --> 45:09.239
* You have to go on living

45:09.273 --> 45:14.445
* So one of us is living

45:16.246 --> 45:20.717
The hardest thing in this world
is to live in it.

45:25.891 --> 45:27.458
(clapping)

45:28.659 --> 45:30.695
Now, that was
a show-stopping number.

45:30.728 --> 45:33.731
Not quite the fireworks
that I was looking for--

45:33.764 --> 45:37.434
-Get out of here.
-Hmm, I smell power.

45:37.467 --> 45:42.072
I guess the little missus and I
should be on our way.

45:42.106 --> 45:43.373
That's never gonna happen.

45:43.407 --> 45:45.943
(chuckles)
I don't make the rules.

45:45.976 --> 45:48.079
She summoned me.

45:48.112 --> 45:51.382
I so did not.
He keeps saying that.

45:51.416 --> 45:53.650
You have my talisman on,
sweet thing.

45:53.684 --> 45:57.487
Oh, but, no.
I-- I, um--

45:57.521 --> 46:00.625
This-- At the Magic Box,
on the floor-- I was--

46:00.657 --> 46:02.960
I was cleaning,
and I forgot--

46:02.994 --> 46:04.929
But I didn't
summon anything.

46:04.963 --> 46:06.998
Well, now, that's a twist.

46:07.032 --> 46:08.934
If it was in the shop,

46:10.335 --> 46:12.637
then one of us probably--

46:18.309 --> 46:20.911
-Xander!
-Well, I didn't know
what was gonna happen.

46:20.945 --> 46:23.949
I just thought
there were gonna be
dances and songs.

46:23.981 --> 46:27.318
I just wanted to make sure
we'd-we'd work out.

46:27.351 --> 46:29.753
Get a happy ending.

46:29.786 --> 46:32.990
(chuckles)
I think everything
worked out just fine.

46:35.793 --> 46:37.661
Does this mean
that I have to...

46:39.965 --> 46:41.766
be your queen?

46:41.798 --> 46:44.135
It's tempting,

46:44.168 --> 46:47.672
but I think we'll
waive that clause
just this once.

46:47.704 --> 46:51.041
Big smiles, everyone.

46:51.076 --> 46:53.878
You beat the bad guy.

46:53.911 --> 46:56.146
* What a lot of fun

46:56.181 --> 47:00.650
* You guys have been
real swell *

47:02.887 --> 47:05.222
* And there's not a one

47:05.255 --> 47:11.195
* Who can say
this ended well *

47:11.228 --> 47:15.233
* All those secrets
you've been concealing *

47:15.266 --> 47:19.670
* Say you're happy now
once more with feeling *

47:19.704 --> 47:23.208
* Now I gotta run

47:23.240 --> 47:25.376
* See you all

47:25.409 --> 47:31.115
* In hell

47:47.764 --> 47:52.137
* Where do we go
from here *

47:56.474 --> 48:02.246
* Where do we go
from here *

48:02.280 --> 48:06.184
* The battle's done
and we kind of won *

48:06.217 --> 48:10.755
* So we sound
our victory cheer *

48:10.788 --> 48:16.161
* Where do we go
from here *

48:19.396 --> 48:23.668
* Why is the path unclear

48:26.103 --> 48:31.409
* When we know
home is near *

48:32.909 --> 48:36.713
* Understand
we'll go hand in hand *

48:36.746 --> 48:39.583
* But we'll walk alone in fear

48:39.617 --> 48:41.119
* Tell me

48:41.152 --> 48:45.956
* Where do we
go from here *

48:48.326 --> 48:53.297
* When does the end appear

48:53.331 --> 48:56.067
(scoffs)
Bugger this.

48:56.101 --> 49:00.271
* When do the trumpets cheer

49:01.871 --> 49:04.342
* The curtains close
on a kiss *

49:04.375 --> 49:07.978
* God knows
we can tell the end is near *

49:08.012 --> 49:09.947
Hey.

49:11.181 --> 49:13.684
You should go back inside,

49:13.717 --> 49:17.322
finish the big group sing,
get your kumbayayas out.

49:18.389 --> 49:20.525
I don't want to.

49:20.557 --> 49:22.659
The day you suss out
what you do want,

49:22.693 --> 49:25.195
there'll probably
be a parade.

49:25.230 --> 49:27.132
76 bloody trombones.

49:27.164 --> 49:30.135
-Spike--
-Look, you don't
have to say anything.

49:30.168 --> 49:35.373
* I touch the fire
and it freezes me *

49:35.405 --> 49:38.543
-* I died
-* I look into it

49:38.576 --> 49:40.545
* So many years ago
* And it's black

49:42.880 --> 49:45.949
* This isn't real
* But you can make me

49:45.983 --> 49:49.719
* But I just wanna feel
* Feel

49:52.590 --> 49:58.396
ALL:
* Where do we
go from here *
