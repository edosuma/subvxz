CHRIS ROCK:
Most days at school

00:05.839 --> 00:07.075
were usually the same.

00:07.108 --> 00:09.043
I got there at the same time,

00:09.077 --> 00:10.578
I saw the same kids.
Hey, Chris.

00:10.611 --> 00:11.579
Hey, Greg.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.814
Hey, Ebony.

00:13.847 --> 00:16.150
Ivory.

00:16.184 --> 00:18.352
And I took the same classes
with the same teachers.

00:18.386 --> 00:19.820
So did you hear?

00:19.853 --> 00:22.223
Ms. Morello's gonna be gone for,
like, two or three weeks.

00:22.256 --> 00:23.391
What?

00:23.424 --> 00:24.758
Yeah. She went
on a trip to Africa

00:24.792 --> 00:26.527
to help fight off an outbreak
of yellow fever.

00:26.560 --> 00:29.363
It was more like she went
to Harlem to fight off

00:29.397 --> 00:30.764
an outbreak of jungle fever.

00:35.236 --> 00:38.372
* Get your groove on,
get your groove on *

00:38.406 --> 00:39.507
* Come on...

00:39.540 --> 00:41.409
With Ms. Morello gone,

00:41.442 --> 00:44.412
we had every kind of substitute
imaginable.

00:44.445 --> 00:45.713
We had out-of-work actors...

00:45.746 --> 00:49.150
:
"To be... or not to be.

00:49.183 --> 00:52.286
That... is the question."

00:52.320 --> 00:54.788
...we had out-of-work
dancers...

00:57.458 --> 00:59.493
Can one of you kids get that
bucket of water

00:59.527 --> 01:01.695
and throw it on me?

01:01.729 --> 01:05.466
...and, sometimes, we had
out-of-work teachers.

01:07.301 --> 01:10.138
Enjoy this while you still can,

01:10.171 --> 01:14.475
'cause, believe me, it's all
downhill from here.

01:14.508 --> 01:16.644
We'd had just about every type
of sub we could think of...

01:18.179 --> 01:20.148
...except one-- a black sub.

01:20.181 --> 01:22.783
Good morning. I'm Mr. Newton.

01:22.816 --> 01:24.518
More like Mr. Tibbs.

01:24.552 --> 01:25.586
What's your name?

01:25.619 --> 01:27.188
Joey Caruso.

01:27.221 --> 01:28.789
And you're making fun of
me because I'm black?

01:28.822 --> 01:30.491
Yeah, you big dummy.

01:30.524 --> 01:31.492
He does it
to me every day.

01:31.525 --> 01:32.660
No, sir.

01:32.693 --> 01:33.861
Sounds like it to me.

01:33.894 --> 01:35.263
Sorry.

01:35.296 --> 01:37.131
If you want to make fun
of me, fine.

01:37.165 --> 01:39.667
But make fun of me for what
I do, not how I look.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.269
You don't see me
making fun of you

01:41.302 --> 01:43.771
because you look like
a Brooklyn Beach
Barney Rubble.

01:45.306 --> 01:47.475
No, sir.

01:47.508 --> 01:51.679
This black sub is
a bad mother...

02:25.446 --> 02:26.714
And the stock market crashed.

02:26.747 --> 02:28.516
It was unprecedented.

02:28.549 --> 02:30.884
Can you imagine putting all
your money in a piggy bank,

02:30.918 --> 02:32.486
and then one day it's gone?

02:32.520 --> 02:34.422
It was nice to have another
black person at school

02:34.455 --> 02:36.457
who wasn't asked
to carry a mop.

02:36.490 --> 02:39.493
For once, I thought I'd have it
better than everybody else.

02:39.527 --> 02:42.230
Gregory, A-minus. Stellar.

02:42.263 --> 02:43.397
Yes!

02:43.431 --> 02:45.533
Donald, C-plus.
You're getting there.

02:45.566 --> 02:47.535
Hold on a second.

02:47.568 --> 02:48.502
What is this?

02:48.536 --> 02:49.637
B-minus! All right!

02:49.670 --> 02:51.305
You're happy
with this grade?

02:51.339 --> 02:52.806
I usually don't do
this well in math.

02:52.840 --> 02:56.510
Really?

02:56.544 --> 02:58.546
Do you know who Sam Graddy is?

02:58.579 --> 03:00.381
No.

03:00.414 --> 03:02.750
Sam Graddy finished second
behind Carl Lewis

03:02.783 --> 03:04.785
in the 100-meter dash
at the Summer Olympics.

03:04.818 --> 03:07.655
So?

03:07.688 --> 03:08.822
Sam Graddy is

03:08.856 --> 03:10.958
the second-fastest man alive

03:10.991 --> 03:13.461
and it doesn't mean
a damn thing.

03:13.494 --> 03:15.496
Sam Graddy doesn't have
a Wheaties box,

03:15.529 --> 03:17.865
no shoe endorsement, no Sam
Graddy running shorts;

03:17.898 --> 03:20.268
not even a pair
of Sam Graddy socks.

03:20.301 --> 03:21.469
Sam Graddy couldn't even
get his own name

03:21.502 --> 03:22.670
on his driver's license.

03:22.703 --> 03:25.306
They gave him one that
says "Carl Lewis."

03:25.339 --> 03:27.975
B-minus. Huh.

03:28.008 --> 03:29.577
Wait, what
are you doing?

03:29.610 --> 03:32.546
B-minus... F.

03:32.580 --> 03:34.382
All the same.

03:34.415 --> 03:35.649
No, no, no, it's not.

03:35.683 --> 03:37.351
One's a pass and one's a fail.

03:37.385 --> 03:38.486
Not for you.

03:38.519 --> 03:40.988
You think I'm sitting here
because of making B

03:41.021 --> 03:43.557
No, I think you're sitting here
because my real teacher is gone.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.995
You getting smart?

03:48.028 --> 03:49.463
Is that a trick question?

03:50.631 --> 03:53.501
He's got a gun.

03:53.534 --> 03:56.704
My resume.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.672
Harvard, Stanford, Oxford.

03:58.706 --> 04:00.674
Mumford.

04:00.708 --> 04:03.744
So if you're so smart, why are
you still substitute teaching?

04:03.777 --> 04:06.680
Because, every now and then,
I need someone who needs me.

04:06.714 --> 04:09.016
And, Chris, that
someone is you.

04:09.049 --> 04:11.452
Starting tomorrow,
I'm going to get
some brains

04:11.485 --> 04:12.686
into that head of yours.

04:12.720 --> 04:15.323
And I'm going to put a brick
upside that head of yours.

04:15.356 --> 04:17.858
You keep that resume
as a reminder.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.797
Oh, hey, I forgot my test.

04:23.831 --> 04:26.534
Oh, C. Way to go.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.302
I guess that was his way

04:28.336 --> 04:30.371
of keeping the white man down.

04:30.404 --> 04:34.642
Nothing made Drew unwind better
than watching hockey,

04:34.675 --> 04:36.544
and nothing could wind him up

04:36.577 --> 04:38.446
quicker than Tonya.

04:38.479 --> 04:40.481
I'm watching hockey.

04:40.514 --> 04:42.550
Simon and Simon
is on.

04:42.583 --> 04:44.385
Well, too bad.
I was here first.

04:46.454 --> 04:47.721
Stop.

04:47.755 --> 04:50.324
Ma, Drew hit me!

04:50.358 --> 04:51.692
What are you talking about?

04:51.725 --> 04:52.660
I barely touched you.

04:52.693 --> 04:54.395
What is going on in here?

04:54.428 --> 04:55.629
Drew hit me.

04:55.663 --> 04:56.564
Did you hit your sister?

04:56.597 --> 04:57.431
No, Ma,

04:57.465 --> 04:59.032
I was watching
the hockey game and...

04:59.066 --> 05:00.701
I don't care what
game you were watching?

05:00.734 --> 05:05.439
I'm raising men in this house,
and men do not hit women.

05:05.473 --> 05:07.007
That meant you
couldn't hit a girl

05:07.040 --> 05:08.709
even if you were supposed
to hit her.

05:11.379 --> 05:12.646
You better not
hit that girl.

05:15.616 --> 05:18.352
Well, since you feel the need
to hit on people,

05:18.386 --> 05:20.688
I better not see you watching
TV for the next three days.

05:20.721 --> 05:22.490
Now just go

05:22.523 --> 05:23.857
take your butt upstairs.

05:23.891 --> 05:27.695
And with that, Tonya learned
the magic words.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.062
She could do anything
she wanted,

05:29.096 --> 05:30.964
as long as it was followed
by "Drew hit me."

05:30.998 --> 05:32.933
TONYA:
Ma!
What's going on in here?

05:32.966 --> 05:35.469
I'm trying to take
Drew's sock and he hit me.

05:35.503 --> 05:37.671
Boy, you better
give her your sock.

05:41.041 --> 05:43.611
Ma!
What is going on in here?

05:43.644 --> 05:45.579
I was trying to take
Drew's breakfast and he hit me.

05:45.613 --> 05:47.415
Boy, you better give
her your breakfast.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.984
Ma!
What is going on in here?

05:51.018 --> 05:53.654
I'm trying to break Drew's arm
and he hit me.

05:53.687 --> 05:56.056
Boy, you better let
her break your arm.

05:56.089 --> 05:59.560
Ow! Ow!

05:59.593 --> 06:01.729
Every time we saw
Mr. Omar

06:01.762 --> 06:03.697
he wanted to borrow something.

06:03.731 --> 06:04.832
Hey, Mr. Omar.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.700
Oh, hey, Mr. Julius.

06:10.804 --> 06:12.573
Can I help you?

06:12.606 --> 06:15.042
Well, you know, I was about
to go and use the pay phone

06:15.075 --> 06:16.977
to make a phone call,

06:17.010 --> 06:19.413
but since you're home, I might
as well use your phone.

06:19.447 --> 06:21.181
What happened to your phone?

06:21.214 --> 06:23.551
To tell you the truth,
I don't know.

06:23.584 --> 06:24.585
I do.

06:24.618 --> 06:26.119
If he's not going to talk to me,

06:26.153 --> 06:28.522
he's not going to talk
to anybody.

06:28.556 --> 06:30.891
He's lucky she didn't work
for the electric company.

06:30.924 --> 06:33.894
It's not a long-distance
call, is it?

06:33.927 --> 06:35.529
Oh, no, it's local.

06:35.563 --> 06:38.165
Yeah, all right, go ahead.

06:38.198 --> 06:40.701
Thank you-- you a
gentleman and a scholar.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.803
Tell one of the kids
to let you out.

06:42.836 --> 06:44.872
While Mr. Omar was dialing
his number,

06:44.905 --> 06:47.107
I was trying to make sense
of Mr. Newton's numbers.

06:47.140 --> 06:50.744
Chris, algebraic equations
use mathematical statements

06:50.778 --> 06:52.846
to describe the relationship
between things

06:52.880 --> 06:53.814
that vary over time.

06:53.847 --> 06:56.216
Like, X means I'm confused.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.518
I still don't understand.

06:57.551 --> 06:59.152
Exactly.

06:59.186 --> 07:03.757
That's algebra-- the math
of the unknown.

07:03.791 --> 07:06.660
Well, I must be doing great,
because I don't know it.

07:06.694 --> 07:09.196
Algebra wasn't the only thing
I didn't know.

07:09.229 --> 07:11.799
And everything I didn't know,
he was determined to teach me.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.801
He taught me language...

07:13.834 --> 07:17.070
Veni, vidi, vici--
"I came, I saw, I conquered."

07:17.104 --> 07:21.575
Eenie, meenie, miney, mo--
catch a tiger by the toe.

07:21.609 --> 07:23.511
He taught me history.

07:23.544 --> 07:25.012
The Vitruvian Man.

07:25.045 --> 07:28.716
The hangman. Pick a letter.

07:28.749 --> 07:30.518
He taught me science.

07:30.551 --> 07:32.219
Your turn.

07:32.252 --> 07:33.453
Got anything bigger?

07:33.487 --> 07:37.057
Please don't kill me in the
name of science-- ribbet!

07:37.090 --> 07:39.727
Is a B!

07:39.760 --> 07:41.629
No, sir!

07:41.662 --> 07:43.731
Do you want to learn?!
Yes, sir!

07:43.764 --> 07:44.765
Do you want to quit?!

07:44.798 --> 07:46.233
No, sir!

07:46.266 --> 07:48.902
You want to go
to another school?!
No, sir!

07:48.936 --> 07:50.003
Why?!

07:50.037 --> 07:51.772
'Cause I have no other
place to go!

07:51.805 --> 07:54.174
Then you better answer
my question:

07:54.207 --> 07:56.977
What's A squared plus B squared?

07:57.010 --> 07:58.111
C squared.

07:58.145 --> 08:00.180
I can't hear you!

08:00.213 --> 08:02.850
C squared...

08:02.883 --> 08:04.184
:
Its C squared.

08:04.217 --> 08:05.619
That's right.

08:05.653 --> 08:06.987
That's what I'm
talking about.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.823
That was the worst wet T-shirt
contest ever.

08:12.259 --> 08:14.194
Hey, man, what's
going on with you?

08:14.227 --> 08:15.262
You look a mess.

08:15.295 --> 08:18.065
And how long is he going
to make you wear that shirt?

08:18.098 --> 08:19.533
I don't know.

08:19.567 --> 08:21.835
Probably until I get an
A or until he leaves.

08:21.869 --> 08:22.870
Well, he's only got about
another week.

08:22.903 --> 08:24.672
Class...

08:24.705 --> 08:26.807
I just wanted
to let you all know

08:26.840 --> 08:29.109
that I've accepted a permanent
position here at Corleone.

08:29.142 --> 08:32.112
And that position is
in my behind.

08:43.791 --> 08:47.861
Ma, Drew's watching TV.

08:47.895 --> 08:49.663
Didn't I tell you
no TV?

08:49.697 --> 08:51.064
I was reading.
I didn't even turn it on.

08:51.098 --> 08:52.566
I don't care who turned it on.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.234
Now go to your room.

08:54.267 --> 08:55.869
Tonya got more people
in trouble

08:55.903 --> 08:58.572
than a white girl
at an NBA after-party.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.945
My father already had two jobs
when he took on a third--

09:04.978 --> 09:06.880
Mr. Omar's receptionist.

09:06.914 --> 09:09.049
Hello.

09:09.082 --> 09:10.884
Mr. Omar?

09:12.953 --> 09:14.855
Yeah, I guess I can
get him for you.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.223
Hold on.

09:18.291 --> 09:21.028
Back at school, I was
holding on, too.

09:21.061 --> 09:24.698
Just a reminder that, next week,
I will be conducting

09:24.732 --> 09:27.668
practice exams
for the statewide

09:27.701 --> 09:29.369
scholastic test.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.605
The exam he's talking about
was critically important.

09:31.639 --> 09:33.974
This exam is
critically important.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.976
This exam is
critically important.

09:36.009 --> 09:38.145
So I advise all of you
to study hard.

09:38.178 --> 09:39.947
Especially you, Chris.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.751
Man, I can't believe this.

09:43.784 --> 09:44.918
The guy's going to kill me.

09:44.952 --> 09:46.887
It's not like I didn't
have it bad enough

09:46.920 --> 09:48.822
coming to this school from
the other side of town,

09:48.856 --> 09:50.290
having the kids kick
the crap out of me.

09:50.323 --> 09:53.326
But now the teacher's going
to kick the crap out of me, too.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.963
Quit complaining, Kareem.
I love this guy.

09:55.996 --> 09:57.765
I didn't like him at first

09:57.798 --> 09:58.999
because of
the whole black thing,

09:59.032 --> 10:01.802
but I'm doing better
at math now.

10:01.835 --> 10:04.504
And the things he taught me
about jazz, forget about it.

10:08.375 --> 10:10.210
Chris, may I have
a word with you?

10:10.243 --> 10:12.012
Yes, sir.

10:12.045 --> 10:13.747
This upcoming test

10:13.781 --> 10:16.183
is a measure of your overall
abilities as a student.

10:16.216 --> 10:18.018
And if you don't score in
the 90th percentile,

10:18.051 --> 10:19.687
I'm going to recommend that
you repeat eighth grade.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.121
What?!
You can't do that.

10:21.154 --> 10:22.389
I can and I will.

10:22.422 --> 10:24.224
Are you serious?

10:24.257 --> 10:26.794
As a catastrophic cardiac
infarction.

10:26.827 --> 10:29.697
Stop showing off--
just say heart attack.

10:29.730 --> 10:32.866
I don't know how I'm going to do
it, but this guy's got to go.

10:32.900 --> 10:35.068
Maybe you could score
in the 90th percentile

10:35.102 --> 10:37.237
and he'll have a catastrophic
cardiac infarction.

10:37.270 --> 10:38.305
Stop showing off.

10:38.338 --> 10:41.108
Just say "heart attack."

10:41.942 --> 10:44.912
He fell down the elevator shaft?

10:44.945 --> 10:46.780
Tragic.

10:46.814 --> 10:47.280
Excuse me, Mr. Omar.

10:47.314 --> 10:48.215
Hold on, Mr. Julius.

10:48.248 --> 10:50.784
Oh, he wanted to hold on,
all right.

10:50.818 --> 10:52.152
I'm holding on now.

10:52.185 --> 10:53.386
Now, who you gonna call, huh?

10:53.420 --> 10:55.856
OMAR :
Let go.

10:55.889 --> 10:57.390
Tragic.
:
Yeah.

10:57.424 --> 10:58.892
Tragic...

10:58.926 --> 11:01.128
I need to make a call.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.763
I'm almost off.

11:02.796 --> 11:05.165
He better be,
because it's almost on.

11:05.198 --> 11:08.135
:
No.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.737
That's what he here for.

11:09.770 --> 11:11.805
For the next few days,
all I did was study

11:11.839 --> 11:13.907
for that test
and try to figure out a way

11:13.941 --> 11:15.242
to get rid of Mr. Newton.

11:15.275 --> 11:17.177
I could call the feds

11:17.210 --> 11:19.847
and say Mr. Newton was working
for the Mob.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.949
(engine revving,
tires screeching)

11:21.982 --> 11:23.851
There he is.
Come on, get him.

11:23.884 --> 11:25.853
Let's move.

11:25.886 --> 11:26.920
I could call the Mob

11:26.954 --> 11:30.858
and say Mr. Newton was working
for the feds.

11:31.892 --> 11:32.860
Come with us!
Get in!

11:32.893 --> 11:34.494
Or I could call his wife

11:34.527 --> 11:37.030
and say he had a white woman
on the side.

11:37.064 --> 11:39.499
There she is! Get her!

11:39.532 --> 11:40.901
No!

11:42.836 --> 11:46.006
One way or another,
he had to go.

11:48.175 --> 11:49.977
What's up
with you, man?

11:50.010 --> 11:52.045
You been looking
kind of tired lately.

11:52.079 --> 11:53.346
Let me ask you
a question.

11:53.380 --> 11:54.915
How do you get
rid of somebody

11:54.948 --> 11:56.349
that's been giving
you problems?

11:56.383 --> 11:58.118
Now, when you say "get rid of,"

11:58.151 --> 12:00.453
do you mean
get "rid" of "rid of,"

12:00.487 --> 12:02.756
or just rid of?

12:02.790 --> 12:04.191
Just get rid of.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.059
He has a job, and I don't
want him to have it.

12:06.093 --> 12:08.896
Boy, you better watch
what you're talking about, boy!

12:08.929 --> 12:09.863
You make a mistake, boy--

12:09.897 --> 12:11.131
You want to talk about this
first, or what?!

12:11.164 --> 12:12.766
I didn't touch you.

12:12.800 --> 12:13.967
It's my substitute
teacher.

12:14.001 --> 12:18.071
Oh. Oh... Well, then,
in that case,

12:18.105 --> 12:19.539
what do you
know about him?

12:19.572 --> 12:24.277
Well, mostly... just this.

12:24.311 --> 12:25.879
What is this?

12:25.913 --> 12:29.016
His resume.

12:29.049 --> 12:31.218
While the ghetto Rambo worked
with me,

12:31.251 --> 12:33.553
the ghetto Gretzky
worked on my ma.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.388
Hey, Ma, can I
watch the big game?

12:35.422 --> 12:37.290
No. You should
have thought about that

12:37.324 --> 12:39.092
before you
hit your sister.

12:39.126 --> 12:41.028
Ma, I didn't hit her.

12:41.061 --> 12:42.329
What do you call it then?

12:42.362 --> 12:43.964
She was trying
to take the remote away,

12:43.997 --> 12:45.432
and I just tapped her
on the wrist.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.901
So you hit her.

12:47.935 --> 12:50.137
I guess.

12:50.170 --> 12:52.039
Just a little.
But she started it.

12:52.072 --> 12:53.340
That does not matter, Drew.

12:53.373 --> 12:55.075
You do not hit girls.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.576
Bottom line,

12:56.609 --> 12:57.878
do you understand me?

12:57.911 --> 12:58.979
My mother ruined any chance

12:59.012 --> 13:00.848
Drew had of becoming a pimp.

13:00.881 --> 13:03.050
Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry.

13:03.083 --> 13:04.151
Okay.

13:04.184 --> 13:06.353
Now go watch
your hockey game.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.521
Thanks, Ma.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.996
"Corleone Junior High School
letter of resignation."

13:16.029 --> 13:18.065
Do you think this will work?

13:18.098 --> 13:20.901
Of course it'll work,
or my name ain't Monk.

13:20.934 --> 13:22.435
His name's not Monk.

13:22.469 --> 13:25.538
His name was Jimmy.

13:25.572 --> 13:28.942
Since I was tired
of taking the heat from Newton,

13:28.976 --> 13:31.544
the best thing to do
was get him fired.

13:31.578 --> 13:33.380
All it took
was a simple equation:

13:33.413 --> 13:36.049
"A" plus "B" equals "See ya!"

13:44.091 --> 13:46.459
No! No!

13:50.297 --> 13:52.465
Oh, I love talking
to you, too.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.935
Oh, yeah, call me
anytime-- anytime.

13:54.968 --> 13:56.336
All right.
All right, now.

13:59.039 --> 14:00.941
Hey, listen.

14:00.974 --> 14:05.045
If Mrs. Perkins calls,
just say I'm not home.

14:05.078 --> 14:06.113
You're not.

14:06.146 --> 14:07.114
You're on it.

14:09.016 --> 14:11.018
You don't miss a thing,
Mr. Julius.

14:14.154 --> 14:15.155
You ready for the test?

14:15.188 --> 14:16.990
As ready as
I'll ever be.

14:17.024 --> 14:19.026
Especially
if I don't have to take it.

14:21.428 --> 14:23.096
Ms. Morello!

14:23.130 --> 14:25.165
Oh, Chris,
you're still here!

14:25.198 --> 14:28.235
I was so afraid the system would
have brought you down by now.

14:28.268 --> 14:30.470
We thought you
were in Africa.

14:30.503 --> 14:32.906
I was, but there
was a civil war.

14:32.940 --> 14:34.007
A war?

14:34.041 --> 14:35.976
Fortunately, they found a way

14:36.009 --> 14:38.011
for all the white people
to get out.

14:38.045 --> 14:40.247
Same thing happened
in New Orleans.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.249
Chris, I love your shirt.

14:42.282 --> 14:44.251
What does
it stand for?

14:44.284 --> 14:46.353
B-minus.

14:46.386 --> 14:49.422
Oh! B-minus.

14:49.456 --> 14:51.224
I love that black street slang.

14:51.258 --> 14:52.492
So what else

14:52.525 --> 14:53.927
did I miss around here?

14:53.961 --> 14:54.995
Well, we were
supposed to

14:55.028 --> 14:58.231
have a practice test
on the statewide exam today.

14:58.265 --> 15:00.067
Oh, forget about that test.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.970
I want to show you the gifts
I brought back.

15:03.003 --> 15:03.971
GREG:
Gifts?

15:04.004 --> 15:06.039
For you, I brought
back a shield

15:06.073 --> 15:08.175
and a spear.

15:08.208 --> 15:10.343
What did you get me?

15:11.544 --> 15:13.313
What is that?

15:13.346 --> 15:14.614
It's a bone.

15:14.647 --> 15:16.583
For your nose, silly.

15:18.185 --> 15:18.851
By the way,

15:18.885 --> 15:22.089
do you know a guy named Induku?

15:22.122 --> 15:24.024
Actually, I did,
but I didn't want

15:24.057 --> 15:26.960
to give her the satisfaction.

15:26.994 --> 15:29.029
At home, Drew was trying
to watch hockey,

15:29.062 --> 15:32.032
and wishing that Tonya
would just shut the puck up.

15:32.065 --> 15:33.133
I want to watch Airwolf.

15:33.166 --> 15:35.335
Mom said I could
watch hockey.

15:35.368 --> 15:37.637
Mom, Drew hit me again!

15:37.670 --> 15:39.206
No, he didn't.

15:39.239 --> 15:42.142
But he was going to.

15:42.175 --> 15:43.643
Oh, he's not the only one.

15:43.676 --> 15:45.612
Upstairs.

15:45.645 --> 15:46.946
We need to talk.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.650
My mother said
boys couldn't hit girls,

15:50.683 --> 15:52.219
but she could.

15:52.252 --> 15:55.055
Turn that up.

15:55.088 --> 15:58.625
ANNOUNCER:
In front, all alone! He shoots!
Scores!

16:04.064 --> 16:06.066
Hello.

16:06.099 --> 16:07.334
Who?

16:07.367 --> 16:09.069
Miz Perkins?

16:09.102 --> 16:11.238
What?

16:11.271 --> 16:13.240
Mr. Omar.

16:13.273 --> 16:14.674
Where?

16:14.707 --> 16:17.110
He's upstairs.

16:17.144 --> 16:18.111
Yeah.

16:18.145 --> 16:19.179
Okay.

16:19.212 --> 16:20.313
Bye.

16:26.586 --> 16:27.754
How you doing?

16:27.787 --> 16:28.788
I'm fine.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.023
¿Como estas?

16:30.057 --> 16:31.124
Muy bien.

16:31.158 --> 16:33.626
Hey, Mr. Omar.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.565
You know, Mr. Julius,

16:38.598 --> 16:40.267
you didn't
have to do that.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.135
If you didn't want me
to use your phone,

16:42.169 --> 16:43.103
why didn't
you just say so?

16:43.136 --> 16:45.405
Sorry.

16:45.438 --> 16:47.540
Sorry?

16:47.574 --> 16:50.110
That was just
wrong, man.

16:50.143 --> 16:51.311
You sorry...

16:51.344 --> 16:53.046
The bald cut is sorry.

16:53.080 --> 16:55.748
Mr. Omar learned what
dope dealers knew for years:

16:55.782 --> 16:57.584
If you want to keep
your business to yourself,

16:57.617 --> 16:59.219
use a pay phone.

17:04.391 --> 17:05.825
Mr. Newton.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.294
What are you doing here?

17:07.327 --> 17:09.162
I came to give you
your practice exam.

17:09.196 --> 17:11.198
I don't have to take that test.

17:11.231 --> 17:12.399
Or let you in.

17:12.432 --> 17:13.766
You're not my teacher anymore.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.335
Remember? You quit.

17:15.368 --> 17:17.404
How do you know I quit?

17:17.437 --> 17:19.606
May I help you?

17:19.639 --> 17:22.309
Don't help him. Help me!

17:22.342 --> 17:24.344
I'm sorry. I'm Mr. Newton.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.546
I've been Chris'
substitute teacher
the past few weeks.

17:26.579 --> 17:28.181
Oh, that's right, yeah.

17:28.215 --> 17:29.449
Chris has said
a lot about you.

17:29.482 --> 17:30.650
Is there a problem?

17:30.683 --> 17:32.285
Yeah, woman.
A crazy man is trying

17:32.319 --> 17:33.553
to give me a test at home.

17:33.586 --> 17:34.854
Not at all.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.357
I've been preparing Chris
for a practice test,

17:37.390 --> 17:39.592
and I wasn't able
to give him the exam before...

17:39.626 --> 17:42.595
Before I got rid
of your crazy ass.

17:42.629 --> 17:44.364
...before I left Corleone.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.233
I just want
to make sure he's ready.

17:46.266 --> 17:48.301
Well, why are you doing this?

17:48.335 --> 17:50.270
I think Chris
is a smart kid,

17:50.303 --> 17:52.272
but I think
he can do better.

17:52.305 --> 17:55.475
Ma?
Better get in there
and take that test.

17:55.508 --> 17:57.410
Mm! Nice satchel.

17:57.444 --> 17:59.212
It's real leather.

17:59.246 --> 18:00.280
Really?

18:01.681 --> 18:06.186
So, the most remarkable
thing happened today.

18:06.219 --> 18:07.454
What's that?

18:07.487 --> 18:09.689
I got a job offer from Lamont

18:09.722 --> 18:11.224
Sanford Junior high.

18:11.258 --> 18:13.493
Oh! Well, that's good.

18:13.526 --> 18:16.363
Funny thing is,

18:16.396 --> 18:18.398
I never applied for a job
at Lamont Sanford.

18:18.431 --> 18:21.368
Well, maybe they heard about you
through the grapevine.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.673
Hey, you wouldn't happen

18:26.706 --> 18:28.675
to still have that copy
of my resume

18:28.708 --> 18:30.177
that I gave you?

18:30.210 --> 18:32.279
Uh... No.

18:32.312 --> 18:33.380
You know what?
I probably lost it.

18:33.413 --> 18:36.483
Oh, yeah... you lost it.

18:40.287 --> 18:41.554
You ready?

18:41.588 --> 18:42.722
Yeah.

18:42.755 --> 18:44.224
Remember Sam Graddy.

18:45.425 --> 18:47.394
You have one hour, starting

18:47.427 --> 18:50.363
now.

18:50.397 --> 18:52.565
Although I didn't want
Mr. Newton as my teacher,

18:52.599 --> 18:55.168
I knew somebody
that would appreciate him.

18:58.271 --> 19:00.273
Pencil down.

19:06.379 --> 19:08.315
So, how did he do?

19:08.348 --> 19:11.351
I'll let you know
in a minute.

19:11.384 --> 19:12.619
I didn't know how I scored,

19:12.652 --> 19:14.487
but I knew Carl Lewis
didn't beat me.

19:17.324 --> 19:19.292
92, Chris. That's an "A."

19:19.326 --> 19:21.628
Oh, baby, that's great!

19:21.661 --> 19:23.430
I knew you could do it.

19:23.463 --> 19:24.597
No, she didn't.

19:24.631 --> 19:28.268
Congratulations, Chris.

19:28.301 --> 19:30.803
Thanks, but it doesn't
make any difference.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.605
I mean,
it doesn't count.

19:32.639 --> 19:34.341
Yes, it does.

19:37.009 --> 19:38.778
Mr. Newton wore me down,

19:38.811 --> 19:41.314
but he was one of the first
teachers I'd ever had

19:41.348 --> 19:44.251
that expected me to do better,
not worse.

19:44.284 --> 19:47.554
The next time I saw Mr. Newton,
he was excited to see me.

19:47.587 --> 19:48.788
Get off me!

19:48.821 --> 19:50.690
Hey, what happened?

19:50.723 --> 19:52.425
Let me have a quarter.

19:52.459 --> 19:55.262
Teacher got shot, man.

20:01.768 --> 20:04.471
You! You did this to me!

20:04.504 --> 20:06.806
I didn't know
you were going to get shot.

20:06.839 --> 20:08.508
You sent me to this hellhole!

20:08.541 --> 20:10.377
This is your fault!

20:10.410 --> 20:13.313
Oh, you just going
to stand there?!

20:13.346 --> 20:14.881
I know where you live!

20:14.914 --> 20:16.283
I tried to teach you!

20:16.316 --> 20:19.386
I tried to help...
get your hands off of...

20:19.419 --> 20:20.787
I know who
your people is!

20:20.820 --> 20:22.422
Tried to help you!

20:22.455 --> 20:23.690
* Everybody hates Chris.
