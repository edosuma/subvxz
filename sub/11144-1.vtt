You got to be kidding

02:22.405 --> 02:25.033
Is this the caliber of person
we want in the club?

02:26.142 --> 02:28.337
With all due respect, Mr Cummings,

02:28.411 --> 02:32.245
he was the President of
United States

02:32.315 --> 02:34.340
An unfortunate accident

And besides, I cant stand the wife

02:37.187 --> 02:38.711
Denied Next?

02:39.823 --> 02:42.291
Oh, hmm, dykes on spikes

02:42.359 --> 02:45.453

02:45.528 --> 02:48.088
Denied Next?

02:54.404 --> 02:55.803

for an enterprising young man
who can carry a bag

03:56.032 --> 03:57.192

03:58.368 --> 04:00.029

- You want me to carry a bag?

04:00.103 --> 04:02.697
If youd prefer,

04:04.941 --> 04:06.499

Gentlemen, step back!

You are in the presence
of a multi-platinum greatness

04:33.970 --> 04:36.837

Im sorry, Mr Note

04:51.221 --> 04:54.588
I... I don't watch much MTV

04:54.657 --> 04:55.749

of reviewing candidates

04:58.595 --> 05:00.756
for membership, so

05:00.830 --> 05:02.764
Well, we just in time
Sign me up

05:02.832 --> 05:04.697
Im afraid it doesn't work
that way

05:04.767 --> 05:08.703
You see, we have
a very stringent application process

05:08.771 --> 05:09.863
Stringent

05:09.939 --> 05:11.998
Can I get a stringent on the rocks?

05:12.075 --> 05:15.772
Okay, G, could you please show him
some love for me one time

05:20.216 --> 05:24.619
- How's a million?
- Memberships only 500,000

05:24.687 --> 05:26.018
Keep the rest as a gratuity,

05:26.089 --> 05:30.719
you know, for letting us
circumvent your stringent process

05:30.793 --> 05:31.885
You feel me?

05:31.961 --> 05:35.761
No, I don't feel you

05:36.933 --> 05:39.629
This is a very exclusive club

05:39.702 --> 05:41.567
We have a five-year waiting list

05:41.638 --> 05:44.266
A five-year waiting list

05:44.340 --> 05:47.639
of over 600 very qualified candidates

05:47.710 --> 05:49.439
Very qualified

05:49.512 --> 05:51.503
We only have 180 members

05:51.581 --> 05:53.640
I can assure you, Mr Note,

05:53.716 --> 05:57.880
there is not a chance in hell
that you will be number 181

05:57.954 --> 05:59.945
You feel me?

06:00.023 --> 06:01.957
Thats cold, my brother

in Carolina Pines

06:42.966 --> 06:46.527
Location, location, location, right?

06:46.603 --> 06:49.902
Oh, it has a six-car garage,
plenty of parking for all your guests,

06:49.973 --> 06:51.941
and more square footage
than youll know what to do with

06:52.008 --> 06:54.772
Oh, Tom Cruise lives
two doors down

06:54.844 --> 06:57.278
His lot size is much smaller

06:57.347 --> 07:01.681
Now, cant you just hear the blender
whipping up a batch of Margaritas

07:01.751 --> 07:05.744

catching some rays with your bitches

07:05.822 --> 07:07.084

give me one more chance

07:23.072 --> 07:26.132
because this is
the pièce de rèsistance

07:26.209 --> 07:29.337
You have the entire
Carolina Pines Golf and Country Club

07:29.412 --> 07:31.744

07:31.814 --> 07:32.781
Oh, and that...

07:32.849 --> 07:34.942
that right there is the 17th hole,

07:35.018 --> 07:37.851
made famous
when Jack Nicklaus called it the

07:37.920 --> 07:39.285
Best hole in all of golf

07:39.355 --> 07:41.084
Yes, youre a fan

07:41.157 --> 07:42.920
Everybody knows Jacks the man

07:42.992 --> 07:44.926

07:57.173 --> 07:59.334
- Can you do that?
- Oh, fabulous

07:59.409 --> 08:02.503
You are really going to spice things up around
here

08:02.578 --> 08:04.341
You bring the sugar
Fantastic

08:34.577 --> 08:36.169

08:36.245 --> 08:38.270

08:38.347 --> 08:39.609
Thats fine, honey

08:39.682 --> 08:42.378
Just keep your head down
and keep your eyes on the ball

08:42.452 --> 08:44.443
What do you think
about what Im wearing?

08:44.520 --> 08:47.614
Uh, yeah its perfect

08:55.965 --> 08:57.091
Ugh

08:57.166 --> 08:59.691
I think I wear this

08:59.769 --> 09:01.464
it wont restrict my swing

09:01.537 --> 09:03.232
Well, thats perfect, honey

09:03.306 --> 09:04.534
Just remember,

09:04.607 --> 09:09.306
keep your head down
and your eyes on the ball

09:14.584 --> 09:17.280
So when will you make a decision?

09:17.353 --> 09:18.980
Within the next three weeks

09:19.055 --> 09:22.354
Well, I think I speak
for everyone here at Carolina Pines

09:22.425 --> 09:25.588
when I say
we would love to host the US Open

09:25.661 --> 09:27.754
We did have
a successful tournament here,

09:27.830 --> 09:31.425
the year that Jack Nicklaus
shot a 62 on the last day

09:31.501 --> 09:32.832
Oh, yeah, he had a good round

09:32.902 --> 09:35.632
its only two strokes
off my course record

09:36.773 --> 09:38.434
Did I ever tell you about that?

09:38.508 --> 09:40.305
Just last week

09:40.376 --> 09:42.503
- Never grows old, sir
- Yeah

09:42.578 --> 09:44.273
Did you hear something?

09:44.347 --> 09:47.475
Uh, I think its coming

09:50.219 --> 09:51.345

10:38.734 --> 10:40.668
What the hell are you doing
in my golf course?

10:40.736 --> 10:43.261
Shootin a music video
What it look like?

10:43.339 --> 10:45.637
It looks to me like trespassing

10:45.708 --> 10:47.471
It does look like trespassing

10:47.543 --> 10:49.033
And youre the one
thats doin the trespassing

10:49.111 --> 10:51.341
Now, get your monkey ass
off my property

10:51.414 --> 10:52.676
<i>Your property?</i>

10:52.748 --> 10:54.147
You see that line?

10:55.351 --> 10:58.377
It represents
the property line of that estate

10:58.454 --> 11:02.356
Now, 99 years ago your club
leased the land from the owner of record

11:02.425 --> 11:06.521
That 99-year lease expired yesterday,
and was not renewed

11:06.596 --> 11:09.588
One acre belonging to Carolina Pines

11:09.665 --> 11:11.826
reverted back to the owner
of that property

11:11.901 --> 11:14.426
Guess who closed escrow yesterday?

11:15.972 --> 11:17.530
Whoo!

11:20.910 --> 11:21.934
How much do you want?

11:22.044 --> 11:23.375
Oh, it aint about the money

11:23.446 --> 11:25.471
I don't wanna beat you up
on the land at all

11:25.548 --> 11:29.279
All I want is a membership,
and I sign everything over to you

11:29.352 --> 11:31.377
I never get that past the board

11:31.454 --> 11:33.149
All right, girls,
were going commando style

11:33.222 --> 11:35.247
Everybody take off your tops

11:35.324 --> 11:37.258
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
All right, I try

11:37.326 --> 11:39.089
I do what I...
You got a deal

11:39.161 --> 11:41.891
Okay
Dont play with me, though

11:41.964 --> 11:46.094
I keep you up
way past your bedtime deal?

11:51.440 --> 11:54.341
All right, everybody back to one
Here we go, girls

11:54.410 --> 11:55.934
And action!

11:56.946 --> 11:59.847
- # Yeah, yeah #
- Uh, Im sorry, Frosty

11:59.916 --> 12:01.406
Just a slight misunderstanding

12:01.484 --> 12:02.815
Is he a member?

12:03.819 --> 12:05.810
No I assure you, no

12:05.888 --> 12:08.948
I be back in three weeks
to make my final decision

12:09.025 --> 12:11.789
Well make this our little secret,

12:11.861 --> 12:14.591
but if I find out that this
is how you run your club, Cummings,

12:14.664 --> 12:17.224
the only thing youll be hosting
is a Bud Light commercial

12:19.869 --> 12:23.032
I like those Bud Light commercials...
funny and creat...

12:23.839 --> 12:25.534
Im all over it, sir

12:25.608 --> 12:28.042
Can I go back and watch
for a little bit?

12:28.110 --> 12:29.805
No

12:34.383 --> 12:36.510
Everyone

12:36.585 --> 12:39.816
Id like to introduce you
to Miss Shannon Williams

12:39.889 --> 12:42.551
Hello Nice to meet you all

12:42.625 --> 12:45.321
Ive hired Miss Williams
to handle the C-Note situation

12:45.394 --> 12:46.725
She comes highly recommended

12:46.796 --> 12:49.162
Graduated top of her class
from Harvard,

12:49.231 --> 12:50.892
law degree from Columbia

12:51.467 --> 12:52.456
Miss Williams

12:53.669 --> 12:55.534
Gentlemen,
Im not going to waste your time

12:55.604 --> 12:58.198
He owns the property legally
and outright,

12:58.274 --> 13:00.469
and you have
no legal recourse to get it back

13:00.543 --> 13:03.671
Now, the way I see it
is you have two choices...

13:03.746 --> 13:06.374
Take his offer or buy him out

13:06.449 --> 13:09.475
- Harrington?
- Well, yes, its a complex scenario...

13:09.552 --> 13:11.986
- Well buy him out
- Well buy him out

13:12.054 --> 13:14.386
As you legal counsel,
I would advise against it

13:14.457 --> 13:17.358
If I were you, Id take his offer

13:17.426 --> 13:19.690
- Not an option
- Not an option, no

13:19.762 --> 13:20.751
May I ask why?

13:20.830 --> 13:23.230
Hes a... hes a rapper

13:23.299 --> 13:24.698
Not quite our class, dear

13:24.767 --> 13:28.533
This is not a strip club
its a golf and polo club

13:28.604 --> 13:30.697
its gentlemans club

13:30.773 --> 13:32.900
Well, its gonna cost you

13:32.975 --> 13:34.602
Throw some money at him,
Miss Williams,

13:34.677 --> 13:36.201
and make him go away

13:44.320 --> 13:45.344
Thats right

13:45.421 --> 13:47.548
So what I need you to do
is call your boys,

13:47.623 --> 13:50.114
crunch the numbers and yall
gotta make this thing work for me

13:50.192 --> 13:52.023
I dont think its working
on the bill, you now

13:52.094 --> 13:53.789
You either want to be
part of the team or you dont

13:53.863 --> 13:55.387
Toodles Jackass

13:55.464 --> 14:00.128
Sorry to interrupt you, C,
but we have here a Ms Williams,

14:00.202 --> 14:01.635
and shes a

14:01.704 --> 14:02.671
lawyer?

14:03.539 --> 14:05.268
Can I interest you
in something to drink?

14:05.341 --> 14:07.241
No, thank you
This is a business call

14:07.309 --> 14:08.799
- Water?
- No

14:08.878 --> 14:10.470
- Kool Aid?
- No

14:10.546 --> 14:13.879
- Juice?
- No, thank you, Mr Hawkins

14:13.949 --> 14:15.246
All right, cool
Have a seat

14:17.420 --> 14:18.978
Okay

14:19.055 --> 14:21.956
We gotta give you a hand

14:22.858 --> 14:25.088
- Smart play
- How's that?

14:25.161 --> 14:30.098
Sending a beautiful, voluptuous,
honey-caramel-complexioned sister here

14:30.166 --> 14:32.259
to do battle with the big bad brother
from the streets

14:32.368 --> 14:35.667
Mr Hawkins,
youre hardly from the streets

14:35.738 --> 14:37.171
You went to Dartmouth

14:37.239 --> 14:40.037
You graduated
with a bachelor degree in business,

14:40.109 --> 14:41.599
a minor in English lit

14:41.677 --> 14:44.202
- Hmm
- You played lacrosse for the Big Green

14:44.280 --> 14:45.508
Rightwing, wasnt it?

14:45.581 --> 14:49.881
So this gangsta rap thing cover up
that you got going

14:49.952 --> 14:51.442
wont get any play with me

14:51.520 --> 14:55.115
Well, either you know
how to Google real good,

14:55.191 --> 14:56.818
or somebody done did their homework

14:56.892 --> 14:59.258
Well, I like to know
who Im dealing with

14:59.328 --> 15:00.352
So were dealing now

15:00.429 --> 15:02.829
Yes, Im authorized
to settle this dispute

15:02.898 --> 15:04.126
All I want is the membership

15:04.200 --> 15:05.792
I dont know nothing
about no dispute

15:05.868 --> 15:10.305
My client was under duress
and made a rash verbal commitment

15:10.372 --> 15:12.863
Hed like to honor his word but alter it

15:12.942 --> 15:14.307
Oh, this aint about the money

15:14.376 --> 15:17.607
I know
its about sticking it to the man

15:17.680 --> 15:18.772
So whats the number?

15:18.848 --> 15:20.145
There is no number

15:20.216 --> 15:23.777
Come on
Everybody has a price

15:23.853 --> 15:25.115
Girl, you done brought me a gift?

15:25.187 --> 15:26.518
Yes, we did

15:27.957 --> 15:29.015
Three million dollars?

15:30.126 --> 15:31.650
Thats grocery money, baby

15:31.727 --> 15:35.458
Now, the property alone is worth
five million in a soft market

15:35.531 --> 15:38.056
You do the math
You tryin to play me?

15:38.134 --> 15:40.068
Im not trying to play you

15:40.136 --> 15:42.627
I just want to settle this
So what will it take?

15:42.705 --> 15:45.196
I want a membership,

15:45.274 --> 15:48.573
and I wanna
stick it to the man

15:50.379 --> 15:51.403
And the deal is done

15:51.480 --> 15:53.345
<i># You know it could happen,
it don't happen#</i>

15:53.415 --> 15:54.677
<i># Till it happen, when it happen#</i>

15:54.750 --> 15:56.047
<i>- # You gonna wish it never did #
- # Hey! #</i>

15:56.118 --> 15:57.608
Thats the 458, man

15:57.686 --> 16:01.315
You got the 458
where the 622 should be

16:01.390 --> 16:03.756
its stupid its stupid!

16:03.826 --> 16:06.294
Are you sure you wont reconsider?

16:06.362 --> 16:08.728
Well, I dont know

16:08.797 --> 16:13.700
You might have to tell your boss man,
sir, that I aint gonna change my mind

16:13.769 --> 16:17.569
C-100!
Lookin good

16:17.640 --> 16:19.904
Bam, check it out

16:19.975 --> 16:20.907

16:20.976 --> 16:23.274

X- Box 360,

16:23.345 --> 16:27.179
30-gig mega... rrrrr

16:27.249 --> 16:29.740
so you can download the
MP3

16:32.421 --> 16:36.118
Navigation system
so you can ghost-ride the whip

16:36.192 --> 16:38.126
- # Ghost-ride the whip #
- # Ghost-ride the whip #

16:38.194 --> 16:40.219
- # Ghost-ride the whip #
- # ghost-ride the whip #

16:40.296 --> 16:41.285
# Ghost-ride the whip #

16:41.363 --> 16:42.887
# Now, freeze #

16:42.965 --> 16:44.125
Let it go
Bam!

16:44.200 --> 16:46.134
- Bill me, baby
- What you know about that?

16:46.202 --> 16:47.294
- Whats happenin?
- # You know it could happen #

16:47.369 --> 16:48.734
<i>- Yeah!
- # It don't happen#</i>

16:48.804 --> 16:51.796
<i># Till it happen when it happen,
you gonna wish it never did #</i>

16:51.874 --> 16:53.739
<i># You know it could happen#</i>

16:53.809 --> 16:55.606
<i># It don't happen
till it happen when it happen#</i>

16:55.678 --> 16:57.407
<i># You gonna wish it never did #</i>

17:02.184 --> 17:04.345
So how much it cost me?

17:04.420 --> 17:07.218
Nothing Hes not interested
in your money

17:07.289 --> 17:10.122
This is not acceptable,
Miss Williams

17:10.192 --> 17:14.788
I need you to kid-glove this guy,
you know, speak his language,

17:14.863 --> 17:17.457
you know, wine and dine him

17:17.532 --> 17:21.127
Mr Cummings, I am a lawyer,
not a street hooker

17:21.203 --> 17:23.898
I didnt mean to insult you,
Miss Williams

17:23.973 --> 17:25.873
Im just up against it

17:25.941 --> 17:28.239
Exactly what are you up against?

17:28.310 --> 17:33.009
His lifestyle has jeopardized
our chances of hosting the US Open

17:33.082 --> 17:36.176
The USGAs going to be here
in three weeks to make their decision,

17:36.252 --> 17:37.514
and I need this guy gone

17:37.586 --> 17:43.286
I will not let a low-life street thug ruin everything
Ive worked so hard for

17:43.359 --> 17:45.156
So give him a membership

17:45.227 --> 17:46.694
Have you not been listening
to what Ive been saying?

17:46.762 --> 17:48.662
According to your bylaws,

17:48.731 --> 17:52.792
all new members are on probation
for the first four weeks

17:52.868 --> 17:56.099
Ah
I like where youre heads at

17:56.171 --> 18:00.164
If he even breaks one rule,
the slightest infraction,

18:00.242 --> 18:01.766
Yeah, he wont last one day

18:01.844 --> 18:03.869
And then youll have grounds
for dismemberment

18:03.946 --> 18:09.475
Dismemberment
Oh I like the sound of that

18:09.551 --> 18:12.349
I thought you would

18:12.421 --> 18:13.979
Have a good day

18:49.658 --> 18:51.683
Whoa, Killah Ink

19:35.170 --> 19:38.298
Hey, Mr C
Whats happening, baby?

19:38.374 --> 19:39.773

19:39.842 --> 19:42.310

19:57.192 --> 19:59.387
Okay, boys, listen up

20:12.174 --> 20:13.766

20:13.842 --> 20:15.605

20:30.325 --> 20:31.587

20:34.430 --> 20:37.024
Youre damn right

Ten to one

20:39.334 --> 20:41.962

something more sinister?

32:28.710 --> 32:31.076

In my day, you met somebody

51:28.315 --> 51:31.614
You fell in love
You got married, you had babies,

51:31.685 --> 51:36.054
none of this sleeping around
and booty calls and online sex

51:36.123 --> 51:38.648
You kids got it all wrong

51:38.725 --> 51:40.556
Momma, chill out
Do we gotta do this now?

51:40.627 --> 51:42.527
Damn right, we have to do it

51:42.596 --> 51:43.824
Look at you

51:43.897 --> 51:46.593
Youre running
around town making millions,

51:46.667 --> 51:49.500
shooting videos, carrying on,

51:49.569 --> 51:51.867
but wheres the love, Christopher?

51:56.777 --> 51:59.871
Little girl, I got your number, too

51:59.946 --> 52:01.470
You running around town

52:01.548 --> 52:05.507
with your big fancy law degree
and your power suits,

52:05.585 --> 52:08.247
spending your time
in a courtroom instead of a bedroom

52:08.322 --> 52:11.189
Your eggs arent getting any fresher
Sweet potato pie?

52:13.126 --> 52:14.388

Okay, so tell me,
was LL more upset with you

52:35.682 --> 52:39.709
about stealing his clothes
or his little, thin mustache?

52:39.786 --> 52:41.651
Well, if you really want to know the truth,

52:41.722 --> 52:45.453
it took me about six, seven months
to get this here chin together,

52:45.525 --> 52:50.189
but LL did help me win
the talent show with that I Need Love

52:50.263 --> 52:51.355
Pow

52:51.431 --> 52:55.094
Im sure you did need love,

01:01:34.821 --> 01:01:37.585
Miss Williams,
this has got to stop

01:01:37.657 --> 01:01:41.024
I cant take this one day more

01:01:41.094 --> 01:01:42.857
What exactly is wrong?

01:01:42.929 --> 01:01:45.420
Look around
The members are enjoying themselves

01:01:45.498 --> 01:01:47.056
I dont care

01:01:47.133 --> 01:01:49.601
its my club
I make the decisions here

01:01:49.669 --> 01:01:51.967
I tell them when to enjoy themselves

01:01:52.038 --> 01:01:55.439
My recommendation
is that you let this thing go

01:01:55.508 --> 01:01:59.911
I think that Christopher Hawkins
is a great addition to your club

01:01:59.979 --> 01:02:03.506
Now you need to find someone else
to do your legal work

01:02:03.583 --> 01:02:04.948
You cant quit me

01:02:05.018 --> 01:02:06.383
I just did

01:02:09.289 --> 01:02:12.258
You did it!
- Told you I dont never lose, baby

01:02:14.227 --> 01:02:16.252
One of us has to go

01:02:16.329 --> 01:02:17.694
How you wanna handle it?

01:02:17.764 --> 01:02:19.629
Golf match
My team wins, you go

01:02:19.699 --> 01:02:21.030
Your team wins, I go

01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:23.898
Thats cool,
but when I bust your ass,

01:02:23.970 --> 01:02:25.767
youre gonna take
that bullshit course record off the wall

01:02:25.838 --> 01:02:26.862
You hear me?

01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:30.000
Ridiculous! I hold the course record
Everybody knows

01:02:30.076 --> 01:02:33.239
Whos this? Whos that?

01:02:33.313 --> 01:02:34.371
Arnold Palmer

01:02:34.447 --> 01:02:36.244
- The caddy
- Caddy?

01:02:36.316 --> 01:02:39.717
Yeah, the caddy
that worked here for over 40 years,

01:02:39.786 --> 01:02:41.686
a caddy you fired

01:02:41.754 --> 01:02:44.723
because he was a better golfer
than you could ever be

01:02:44.791 --> 01:02:46.088
His name was Robert Hawkins

01:02:46.159 --> 01:02:49.128
Is that what this is about?

01:02:49.195 --> 01:02:50.184
A caddy?

01:02:50.263 --> 01:02:51.855
That was my father

01:02:52.899 --> 01:02:56.926
You think he shot a 59, dont you?

01:02:57.003 --> 01:02:59.597
Caddy Mack

01:02:59.672 --> 01:03:03.199
I played with him
the day he posted the score

01:03:03.276 --> 01:03:07.303
If youre calling him a liar,
youre calling me a liar

01:03:13.753 --> 01:03:17.416
I saw this score card 20 years ago

01:03:17.490 --> 01:03:21.927
It is, to be kinda forgery

01:03:21.995 --> 01:03:25.226
its as worthless today as it was then

01:03:25.298 --> 01:03:26.822
It doesnt matter
whether you believe it or not,

01:03:26.899 --> 01:03:28.491
its the truth

01:03:28.568 --> 01:03:30.365
He was the best golfer I ever saw,

01:03:30.436 --> 01:03:33.530
professional or amateur

01:03:36.042 --> 01:03:38.943
We will settle this
on the golf course

01:03:39.012 --> 01:03:40.775
Im looking forward to it

01:03:45.184 --> 01:03:48.881
its a very simple question!
Who ordered the hit?

01:03:48.955 --> 01:03:50.183
Im just a businessman

01:03:50.256 --> 01:03:52.349
Ive got no beef with you
Believe it

01:03:52.425 --> 01:03:55.087
You know, we can do this
the easy way or the hard way

01:03:55.161 --> 01:03:58.528
Cause I love
that big body Benz back there,

01:03:58.598 --> 01:04:00.589
and Im gonna ride tonight

01:04:00.666 --> 01:04:02.361
Love makes a brother stupid

01:04:02.435 --> 01:04:04.198
You dont wanna see me stupid,
little man!

01:04:04.270 --> 01:04:06.500
You got a big-ass mouth, bitch!

01:04:07.974 --> 01:04:12.308
Ooh, is that all you got?
My baby sister hit harder than that

01:04:12.378 --> 01:04:15.438
Hurry up, Tank!
Im starting to get bored with this

01:04:16.115 --> 01:04:20.916
The more time I spend hitting you,
the lest time I spend hitting that, tater tot!

01:04:20.987 --> 01:04:24.582
Next time bring it from the shoulder,
you big pussy!

01:04:25.458 --> 01:04:27.483
Doh... uh yeah?

01:04:29.896 --> 01:04:31.591
The last time Im gonna ask

01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:35.431
Oh, its... its...

01:04:35.501 --> 01:04:40.461
No, dont, big boy
Save your energy

01:04:40.540 --> 01:04:41.973
cause you gonna need it

01:04:44.110 --> 01:04:48.444
Now, if you thought he was bad,
you aint messed with me

01:04:48.514 --> 01:04:51.312
Im queen bitch of this universe

01:04:51.384 --> 01:04:54.512
Now, if you dont tell me
what I want to know,

01:04:54.587 --> 01:04:56.953
after I whoop your ass...

01:04:57.023 --> 01:05:01.460
Okay, okay, okay
I tell you what you wanna know, all right?

01:05:04.397 --> 01:05:05.864
Mick-a-leek-a

01:05:05.932 --> 01:05:07.661
Thought I might find you here
Whats happening, boy?

01:05:07.733 --> 01:05:10.167
Not much
I hear you got a big match tomorrow

01:05:10.236 --> 01:05:12.397
You should be working on your game

01:05:12.472 --> 01:05:13.734
Oh, its too late for that

01:05:13.806 --> 01:05:15.603
its never too late

01:05:15.675 --> 01:05:18.337
Besides, I hear Cummings got a ringer

01:05:18.411 --> 01:05:21.209
I got a ringer of my own, though

01:05:23.616 --> 01:05:25.481
I need this job

01:05:25.551 --> 01:05:28.884
No, you dont,
not when you got C-Note

01:05:29.589 --> 01:05:31.352
Heres your boy I got you

01:05:31.424 --> 01:05:33.051
- All right
- Lets do it

01:05:33.126 --> 01:05:34.115
What the hell

01:05:34.193 --> 01:05:36.320
Giddy-up Lets get it done

01:05:36.395 --> 01:05:38.386
- Yeah
- Ho, hey

01:05:38.464 --> 01:05:40.591
<i># Now, on your mark, get set, go #</i>

01:05:40.666 --> 01:05:42.031

<i># Go go go #</i>

01:05:49.475 --> 01:05:50.965
<i># Now, I've been waitin' a long time #</i>

01:05:51.043 --> 01:05:52.340
<i># I'm patient enough #</i>

01:05:52.411 --> 01:05:53.400

<i># Your hair to the sky,

01:06:08.628 --> 01:06:10.994
Hey, hey, hey
Hello, everyone

01:06:11.063 --> 01:06:13.224

01:06:14.433 --> 01:06:15.422
Ow!

01:06:15.501 --> 01:06:16.490
Whats goin on, baby?

01:06:16.569 --> 01:06:19.504
Looks like everybody showed up
to watch me whoop your ass

01:06:19.572 --> 01:06:21.938
Actually, they showed up to watch

01:06:22.008 --> 01:06:24.738
him whoop on your ass

01:06:34.587 --> 01:06:37.055
All right, let me in here, let me in here
Let the betting begin

01:06:37.123 --> 01:06:39.956
Come on, whos betting on the kid?
Im taking ten-to-one, five-to-one

01:06:40.026 --> 01:06:42.221
Okay, okay,
may I have your attention please?

01:06:42.295 --> 01:06:45.264
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you all for coming here

01:06:45.331 --> 01:06:47.265
to this rather special contest

01:06:47.333 --> 01:06:49.358
Let me explain
what were going to do today

01:06:49.535 --> 01:06:53.528
Well play 18 holes of match play,
best ball

01:06:53.606 --> 01:06:56.097
Mr Parnevik, its your tee, sir

01:06:56.175 --> 01:06:57.472
Thank you

01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:04.415
Attaboy, Jesper!
Hit it good!

01:07:04.483 --> 01:07:06.849
- Eat a sandwich
- Shut up

01:07:13.392 --> 01:07:16.088
Whoa, great shot

01:07:17.663 --> 01:07:19.494
Sweet

01:07:20.633 --> 01:07:22.794
So who wants to follow that one?

01:07:22.868 --> 01:07:23.857
Is that all you got?

01:07:24.670 --> 01:07:26.001
Im just getting warmed up

01:07:28.441 --> 01:07:29.430
Lets go, C-Note

01:07:32.745 --> 01:07:35.942
Come on, breathe, breathe

01:07:39.952 --> 01:07:41.385
Play for your freedom

01:07:44.924 --> 01:07:46.323
Yeah
Oh!

01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:56.031
Looking good, Mick, looking good

01:07:59.405 --> 01:08:01.999
Whoo Whoo

01:08:04.677 --> 01:08:07.737
What did I tell you?
Nice shot, Mick

01:08:11.050 --> 01:08:12.244
Oh, this guy

01:08:14.553 --> 01:08:15.679
Chump

01:08:29.268 --> 01:08:30.394
Stop

01:08:31.737 --> 01:08:33.102
My mouth was open

01:08:33.171 --> 01:08:37.165
Damn, thats a lot of sound
out of a quarter-inch speaker

01:08:37.243 --> 01:08:39.939
Are you done?

01:08:42.415 --> 01:08:43.712
Swing away

01:08:57.229 --> 01:08:58.662
Watch out there!

01:09:02.167 --> 01:09:05.968
- Boo
- Boo, boo

01:09:22.455 --> 01:09:23.786
Oh

01:09:26.125 --> 01:09:27.490
Oh

01:09:46.879 --> 01:09:48.506
Damn, that waters deep

01:09:57.990 --> 01:09:59.821
Oh

01:10:02.261 --> 01:10:03.592
Oh

01:10:21.747 --> 01:10:23.510
Does this smell infected?

01:10:41.434 --> 01:10:42.765
Shoot him

01:10:42.835 --> 01:10:46.532
Ladies and gentlemen,
at the end of the outward nine,

01:10:46.605 --> 01:10:49.096
Mr Cummings team is four holes up

01:10:49.175 --> 01:10:53.544
We shall take a 15-minute break
and convene back at the 10th hole

01:10:53.612 --> 01:10:54.636
Thank you

01:10:54.713 --> 01:10:57.113
Cant we kill him?
Come on

01:10:57.283 --> 01:10:59.114
I thought it was

01:11:00.719 --> 01:11:02.209
You aint foolin, man

01:11:02.288 --> 01:11:05.382
Yo, wait
Show me the money, baby

01:11:05.458 --> 01:11:08.256
Man, were getting bitch-slapped

01:11:08.327 --> 01:11:10.955
This guys got shots in his bag
I didnt know existed

01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:12.497
Big deal

01:11:14.133 --> 01:11:17.660
What are you,
a couple of pussies having a pity party?

01:11:17.736 --> 01:11:19.294
Hes great
So what?

01:11:19.371 --> 01:11:20.395
See, thats your problem

01:11:20.473 --> 01:11:21.963
Youre playing him
instead of the course

01:11:22.041 --> 01:11:23.770
It doesnt matter how great he is

01:11:23.843 --> 01:11:27.574
Every time you put a peg in the turf,
youre playing Old Man Par

01:11:27.646 --> 01:11:32.913
Now, youve got two choices...
you can either play big or go home

01:11:34.987 --> 01:11:36.420
Im going to go warm up

01:11:39.024 --> 01:11:40.184
You know

01:11:40.259 --> 01:11:44.423
whether you win or lose,
your father would be proud of you

01:11:44.497 --> 01:11:46.931
He didnt give a damn
about course records

01:11:46.999 --> 01:11:50.162
He golfed his ball
because he loved the game

01:11:50.236 --> 01:11:51.931
And thats what you need to do

01:11:52.671 --> 01:11:56.072
See, this could be the last time
you set foot on this course

01:11:56.141 --> 01:11:57.870
Make it count

01:12:13.659 --> 01:12:14.751
Hey

01:12:14.827 --> 01:12:16.954
Hey, hey
Whats happening?

01:12:17.029 --> 01:12:21.523
I wanted you to know
I don't work for Cummings anymore

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:25.536
So sorry
I shouldve quit sooner

01:12:25.604 --> 01:12:27.333
Thats cool
I get it

01:12:27.406 --> 01:12:29.567
Gotta do what you gotta do, right?

01:12:29.642 --> 01:12:30.870
Yeah

01:12:30.943 --> 01:12:33.673
Yeah, you think youre working
for someone thats honest,

01:12:33.746 --> 01:12:35.907
then you find out later theyre not

01:12:37.182 --> 01:12:39.707
Well, the three blind mice
couldve solved that

01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:44.382
Want to wish you luck on your back nine

01:12:44.456 --> 01:12:47.823
Well, you know Im gonna shake em up
its halftime

01:12:47.893 --> 01:12:50.293
All I have is time for the bliss, baby

01:13:09.715 --> 01:13:11.444
Bing! Bam!

01:13:26.365 --> 01:13:28.765
I didnt bring you all this way
for you to... to... to

01:13:28.834 --> 01:13:29.960
- Choke, sir?
- Choke!

01:13:30.936 --> 01:13:32.494
Whoo!

01:14:13.278 --> 01:14:14.336
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:14:14.413 --> 01:14:17.814
after 17 holes, we are dead even

01:14:17.883 --> 01:14:20.351
The winner of the next hole
takes the match

01:14:20.419 --> 01:14:22.353
Mick, its your tee

01:14:22.421 --> 01:14:24.150
Hey, our ticket right there

01:14:25.591 --> 01:14:26.990
Come on, Mick!

01:14:27.059 --> 01:14:29.186
Dont piss like a puppy
Stay on the port

01:14:29.261 --> 01:14:31.229
Let the big dogs eat, brother

01:14:32.631 --> 01:14:33.757
You the man!

01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:43.067
Yeah, thats my dawg

01:14:43.142 --> 01:14:44.609
Give it to em, baby

01:14:46.445 --> 01:14:49.437
Yeah, thats that money shot!
Thats that money shot!

01:14:50.249 --> 01:14:54.345
Oh! Let me lay down on it
Bam

01:14:59.625 --> 01:15:02.958
- I hate you
Meow, meow

01:15:03.796 --> 01:15:05.593
Oh!

01:15:12.838 --> 01:15:14.931
Thats the best shot he hit all day

01:15:17.309 --> 01:15:20.107
Nice shot Beautiful
Great shot

01:15:35.728 --> 01:15:37.286
Give me a five iron

01:15:39.031 --> 01:15:40.862
Dont sweat it

01:15:40.933 --> 01:15:44.994
Like I said, you either play big,
or you go home

01:15:46.405 --> 01:15:47.872
This is my home

01:15:47.940 --> 01:15:49.999
Well, lets act like it

01:15:50.075 --> 01:15:51.940
Come on, Mick-o

01:16:01.019 --> 01:16:02.577
There it is

01:16:02.654 --> 01:16:03.951
Get close, baby

01:16:08.827 --> 01:16:10.158
Whoo
