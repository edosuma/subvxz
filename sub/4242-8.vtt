WEBVTT

00:04.612 --> 00:07.030
I thought you weren't
allowed here.

00:07.114 --> 00:08.080
I'm permitted
on school grounds

00:08.148 --> 00:09.950
as long as I'm
getting my work.

00:10.001 --> 00:11.334
Oh, I wanted to tell you
I'm available

00:11.419 --> 00:12.619
for vocal coaching
if you need any help.

00:12.670 --> 00:14.087
We need to bring our "A" game

00:14.154 --> 00:16.039
if we have any chance
of beating the Trouble Tones.

00:16.123 --> 00:17.490
Oh, we're not gonna have any
trouble with them.

00:17.542 --> 00:20.177
Not as soon as I have
Shelby Corcoran fired.

00:20.261 --> 00:21.995
She's sleeping with Puck.

00:22.046 --> 00:25.632
Look, that's a really, really
dangerous rumor

00:25.683 --> 00:27.300
to make up, okay?

00:27.351 --> 00:28.969
You're gonna ruin
her entire reputation.

00:29.020 --> 00:29.886
That's the plan.
And it's not a lie.

00:29.971 --> 00:31.388
I heard it from Puck.

00:31.472 --> 00:34.173
First of all, Puck is 18, so
what he and Shelby are doing,

00:34.225 --> 00:38.177
even though it's just wrong
and so gross, it's not illegal.

00:38.229 --> 00:39.512
So all you're doing
is you're just,

00:39.564 --> 00:40.614
you're getting her fired,

00:40.681 --> 00:42.232
which is gonna take away
her income

00:42.316 --> 00:44.534
to provide food and clothes

00:44.619 --> 00:47.120
and put a roof over her
child's tiny little blonde head.

00:47.187 --> 00:48.205
Sounds like an unfit mother.

00:48.289 --> 00:49.539
And I'll be waiting in the wings

00:49.624 --> 00:50.991
when they take Beth away
from her.

00:51.042 --> 00:51.992
Beth loves her mom.

00:52.043 --> 00:54.411
Shelby is her real mom.

00:54.495 --> 00:57.297
Look, you've done a lot
of really bad things, Quinn,

00:57.364 --> 01:00.333
but if you tell people about
this Puck-and-Shelby thing,

01:00.384 --> 01:02.201
you'll be ruining this little
girl's life,

01:02.253 --> 01:03.887
and then you'll have really
hit rock bottom.

01:11.929 --> 01:15.482
Sectionals is in our auditorium
for the first time since 1963,

01:15.549 --> 01:17.434
Too much talking,
not enough looking

01:17.518 --> 01:18.551
for songs for Sectionals.

01:18.603 --> 01:20.053
We need to do something upbeat.

01:20.104 --> 01:21.655
Mr. Shue, maybe we need
to concentrate

01:21.722 --> 01:23.907
on our performer problem
before we set a set list.

01:23.991 --> 01:25.892
I mean, at least
the Cheerios! can dance.

01:25.943 --> 01:27.944
We need star power.

01:28.029 --> 01:29.946
We need Sam Evans.

01:30.031 --> 01:31.498
Sam transferred.
His whole family moved.

01:31.565 --> 01:33.199
We don't even know where he is.

01:33.251 --> 01:34.701
He's in Kentucky.

01:34.752 --> 01:36.336
It's just across the
border from Cincinnati.

01:36.403 --> 01:38.121
It's about a four hours
from here.

01:38.205 --> 01:40.790
Even homeless people
have Facebook.

01:43.577 --> 01:45.629
Rachel and I might
as well get used

01:45.713 --> 01:48.131
to a life of barista work
and summer stock.

01:48.215 --> 01:49.599
There's no way we're
getting into NYADA now.

01:49.684 --> 01:51.250
If we don't win at Sectionals,

01:51.302 --> 01:52.969
I pretty much have nothing
to live for.

01:53.054 --> 01:56.022
New Directions! is a mess,
and we're gonna lose, Kurt,

01:56.090 --> 01:58.141
and I can't do a thing about it.

01:58.225 --> 02:00.060
Every time I open my mouth,

02:00.111 --> 02:02.929
Finn gives me these looks like,
"What does he think he's doing?"

02:02.980 --> 02:04.814
I know what I'm doing.

02:04.899 --> 02:06.366
Hey, guys!

02:06.433 --> 02:08.535
It's so crazy.
I'm sitting

02:08.602 --> 02:10.203
over there
checking out this guy

02:10.270 --> 02:11.705
and all of a sudden I'm, like,

02:11.772 --> 02:15.041
"Wait a second
I know that hair."

02:15.109 --> 02:16.960
What's up, buddy?
Haven't seen you online.

02:17.044 --> 02:18.628
Hi, Kurt.

02:18.713 --> 02:20.630
We've been really busy
with Glee Club.

02:20.715 --> 02:22.782
Practicing for Sectionals...
together.

02:22.833 --> 02:26.452
Mmm, congrats on the Warbler win
at your sectionals.

02:26.504 --> 02:28.955
We're up this week.

02:29.006 --> 02:31.725
Yeah. Well, hey, if there's one
guy that can whip New Directions

02:31.792 --> 02:34.427
into a legitimate threat,
it's Blaine Anderson, right?

02:34.478 --> 02:36.295
Right.
I need another coffee.

02:37.982 --> 02:40.517
I don't like you.

02:40.601 --> 02:42.686
Fun.
I don't like you either.

02:42.770 --> 02:45.438
I don't like the way
you talk to my boyfriend,

02:45.489 --> 02:47.490
I don't like your smirky
little meerkat face,

02:47.575 --> 02:49.776
I don't like your
obnoxious CW hair. I'm onto you.

02:49.827 --> 02:52.362
Let's get a few things straight.
Blaine's too good for you.

02:52.446 --> 02:54.147
New Directions! is a joke.

02:54.198 --> 02:55.699
And one of us has
a hard luck case

02:55.783 --> 02:57.483
of the gay-face,
and it ain't me.

02:57.535 --> 03:00.453
Odds are by the end of the
school year, I'll have Blaine

03:00.504 --> 03:02.339
and a nationals trophy,
and you'll have khakis

03:02.423 --> 03:04.323
and a Lima Bean apron
and that gay face.

03:04.375 --> 03:05.759
You smell like Craig's List.

03:05.826 --> 03:08.178
What are you guys
talking about?

03:08.262 --> 03:10.130
Duh, the next time we're all
going out drinking, killer!

03:10.181 --> 03:11.715
Uh-oh.
Well, I gotta run.

03:11.799 --> 03:16.019
But you take care of that
Warbler, Kurt.

03:21.559 --> 03:22.726
Wait. This can't be
the right place.

03:22.810 --> 03:25.145
Sam works in a bar?

03:25.196 --> 03:26.980
Well, there just aren't
a lot of theaters in
Northern Kentucky,

03:27.031 --> 03:28.481
so theatre groups
just have

03:28.532 --> 03:29.949
to perform in whatever
space they can find.

03:30.017 --> 03:32.318
There's a lot of ladies here--
like, older ladies.

03:32.370 --> 03:34.738
Finn, it's no secret
that dinner theater appeals

03:34.822 --> 03:35.989
to elderly women.

03:36.040 --> 03:38.074

DQ was great and I got
two free Blizzards a day,

04:34.515 --> 04:37.767
but it paid just over
minimum wage. Thanks.

these abs pay for it.

Your parents don't know
that you work here?

04:57.705 --> 04:59.572
No, they just think
the DQ pays really well.

05:00.624 --> 05:01.624
I'm good at this.

05:01.709 --> 05:02.859
You're good at it
because you have

shouldn't be doing it.

05:08.582 --> 05:12.552
Come back to McKinley, Sam.
We need you for Sectionals.

05:12.620 --> 05:13.803
Tell me you don't want it.

05:13.888 --> 05:16.089
Dude, you're young,
you got so much potential.

05:16.140 --> 05:18.842

05:25.065 --> 05:26.850
Here we go.

05:31.338 --> 05:34.240
Dad, Mom, what
I'm trying to say

05:34.308 --> 05:36.442
is I want to go back
to Ohio with them.

05:36.494 --> 05:37.861
They need me to compete at
Sectionals this weekend.

05:37.945 --> 05:39.496
And he could stay at one
of our houses,

05:39.580 --> 05:41.164
so it wouldn't be
like he was homeless.

05:41.248 --> 05:42.499
Not that there isn't

05:42.583 --> 05:45.518
a quiet dignity in that
or anything.

You think you two could
go in the other room,

make yourselves
busy, please?

good at looking busy.

Son...

05:58.832 --> 06:00.650

06:00.718 --> 06:02.068
but now we've back
on our feet.

06:03.604 --> 06:06.739
You had to become
a man much sooner

06:06.807 --> 06:08.775
than other kids your age.

06:08.842 --> 06:11.311
I'm-I'm proud of
what we've all done.

06:11.378 --> 06:12.879
It's just that...

06:12.947 --> 06:16.533
I miss being a teenager.

06:17.785 --> 06:19.986
Hey-hey-hey-hey...

06:20.037 --> 06:23.406
Mom, please don't...
Look, if you cry, I won't go.

06:23.490 --> 06:26.876
I'm just crying because...

06:26.961 --> 06:28.461
it just makes me so sad

06:28.528 --> 06:30.964
to think of not seeing
your face every day.

06:31.031 --> 06:33.049
Though I don't
understand why

06:33.133 --> 06:35.468
the Dairy Queen makes you put
that glitter all over it.

members are joining us?

06:49.716 --> 06:51.601
Well, it looks like
"Floppy Hair Bass Dude,"

06:51.685 --> 06:53.736
"Chapped Lips McGee,"
and "Johnny Tromboner."

06:53.821 --> 06:55.355
God, we're screwed.
No, we're not.

06:55.406 --> 06:57.556

09:56.703 --> 10:00.039
I just heard the news that
Trouty Mouth is back in town.

10:00.090 --> 10:01.841
I've been keeping
a notebook, just in case

10:01.908 --> 10:02.925
this day ever came.

10:03.010 --> 10:05.261
"Welcome back, Lisa Rinna.

10:05.345 --> 10:07.680
"I've missed you so much since
your family packed their bags,

10:07.747 --> 10:09.215
"loaded them in your mouth,
and skipped town.

10:09.266 --> 10:12.018
"I can't tell you how
many times I've wanted

10:12.085 --> 10:13.686
"to enjoy a crisp pickle,
but couldn't find anyone

10:13.753 --> 10:15.104
"to suck the lid off the jar.

10:15.189 --> 10:17.089
"I assume you've been
working as a baby-polisher,

10:17.141 --> 10:19.776
"where young mothers place their
infants' heads in your mouth to

10:19.860 --> 10:21.861
"get back that newborn shine.

10:21.928 --> 10:23.029
"So glad you're back.

10:23.096 --> 10:24.614
"I haven't seen
a smile that big

10:24.698 --> 10:26.983
"since a Claymation
Abominable Snowman got

10:27.067 --> 10:29.202
"his teeth pulled by
that little gay elf dentist.

10:29.269 --> 10:30.870
Love, Santana."

10:30.937 --> 10:32.872
I missed you, too, Santana.

10:32.939 --> 10:34.073
Oh, my God.

10:41.715 --> 10:43.616
Hey, Sam, wait up.

10:44.968 --> 10:46.118
I'm sure you've heard

10:46.170 --> 10:47.637
that Mercedes has
a new boyfriend.

10:47.721 --> 10:50.289
He's got a full scholarship
to Ohio State.

10:50.340 --> 10:51.507
Nice to see you,
too, Quinn.

10:51.592 --> 10:52.558
No, no, it's a good thing.

10:52.626 --> 10:54.293
See, I'm free,
you're free.

10:54.344 --> 10:56.012
And I'm sure that you've noticed
that I'm supermodel thin

10:56.096 --> 10:58.147
now that my thyroid is
under control.

10:58.232 --> 11:00.349
What do you want, Quinn?

11:00.434 --> 11:03.236
Look, last year
I didn't appreciate you.

11:03.303 --> 11:05.021
But we're
perfect together.

11:05.105 --> 11:06.805
Quinn...
I'm gonna get Beth back.

11:06.857 --> 11:09.659
And-And you'd be perfect
to help raise her.

11:09.726 --> 11:11.244
You're so good with kids.

11:11.311 --> 11:12.278
What is so funny?

11:12.329 --> 11:13.913
Quinn, you've got

11:13.980 --> 11:15.281
what I call "rich
white girl problems."

11:15.332 --> 11:17.149
It's a tough world
out there, I know.

11:17.201 --> 11:18.251
I've been through it.

11:18.318 --> 11:22.255
You only get one senior year.

11:22.322 --> 11:23.623
Enjoy it.

11:25.709 --> 11:28.177
You know that song "Jack and
Diane" by John Mellencamp?

11:28.262 --> 11:29.846
Please don't sing.
My favorite lyric

11:29.930 --> 11:31.830
is this one:

11:31.882 --> 11:35.635
"Hold on to 16 as
long as you can."

11:50.399 --> 11:51.933
with the applications?
Deadlines are this week.

11:51.984 --> 11:54.969
Tina, I already applied
to Stanford.

11:55.020 --> 11:55.987
Pre-med.

11:58.240 --> 12:00.408
But you don't want to be a
doctor, you want to be a dancer.

12:00.475 --> 12:02.860
Not if it means ripping
my family apart.

12:02.945 --> 12:04.495
My dad hasn't said
one word to me

12:04.580 --> 12:06.164
<i>or my mom since
West Side Story.</i>

12:06.248 --> 12:07.415
I'll dance in my free time.

12:07.482 --> 12:09.000
Everyone's happy.

12:09.084 --> 12:11.819
Except for you.
Mike, your dad needs to

12:11.870 --> 12:13.254
understand that dancing
is your passion,

12:13.321 --> 12:14.505
not some extracurricular.

12:14.590 --> 12:15.990
I miss him, Tina.

12:16.041 --> 12:18.009
I know.
But you have one life, Mike.

12:18.093 --> 12:20.828
One chance to get it right.

12:20.879 --> 12:22.046
Don't be a coward.

12:22.131 --> 12:23.097
Don't call me that.

12:23.165 --> 12:24.765
You won't make it as a dancer

12:24.833 --> 12:27.101
if you're not 100% committed.

12:30.305 --> 12:31.689
So maybe your dad's right.

12:31.773 --> 12:33.674
Maybe you should be a doctor.

12:33.725 --> 12:36.343
Or maybe he's right,
and we shouldn't be together.

12:39.982 --> 12:41.232
...six, seven, eight.

12:41.316 --> 12:42.617
Bum-bum-bum.

12:42.684 --> 12:43.851
Step and hit.

12:43.902 --> 12:45.036
Come on!
To the beat!

12:45.120 --> 12:46.537
What does it even
matter, anyway?

12:46.622 --> 12:47.788
It's not like we have
a chance of winning.

12:47.856 --> 12:48.873
Not without the girls.

12:48.957 --> 12:51.209
Sir, girls smell
better than ham

12:51.293 --> 12:52.910
and when they're dancing
and bouncing around,

12:52.995 --> 12:53.995
you can't help but watch them.

12:54.046 --> 12:55.880
Well, that's it then.

12:55.964 --> 12:57.798
We'll take what's most appealing
about us as a group,

12:57.866 --> 12:59.584
and we'll use it
to our advantage.

12:59.668 --> 13:02.470
Yeah, how about, you know,
something like, um...

13:02.537 --> 13:04.255
something like that?

13:04.339 --> 13:05.539
Cute!
I like the spin,
I like the spin.

13:05.591 --> 13:06.373
Try it again.

13:06.425 --> 13:07.558
Yeah.

13:07.643 --> 13:08.509
God, okay, stop, stop.

13:08.560 --> 13:09.927
Look, Blaine,

13:10.012 --> 13:12.563
this... is totally boy band.

13:12.648 --> 13:15.683
What we need
to sell here is sex.

13:15.734 --> 13:17.101
What the hell is that?

13:17.186 --> 13:18.319
That's a, it's a body roll.

13:18.386 --> 13:19.437
It's not a body roll.

13:19.521 --> 13:22.389
That is sex.

13:25.393 --> 13:27.278
Man's not wrong.

13:27.362 --> 13:29.947
I got light tingles where
it's only 50/50 for tingling.

13:30.032 --> 13:31.199
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sam, that's awesome.

13:31.250 --> 13:32.617
That's exactly what we need.

13:32.701 --> 13:34.252
No, that's not,
that's not what we need.

13:34.336 --> 13:37.571
We don't have to
resort to... that.

13:37.623 --> 13:39.240
It's cheap.

13:39.291 --> 13:40.208
You know, it's selling out.

13:40.259 --> 13:41.626
I came back here to win.

13:41.710 --> 13:44.178
When you're desperate,
sometimes you got to,

13:44.246 --> 13:45.763
you know, use your assets
and do what you got to do

13:45.847 --> 13:46.747
to get back that advantage.

13:46.798 --> 13:49.433
This is the advantage.

13:49.518 --> 13:50.801
Of course that's what you think;
you have to

13:50.886 --> 13:52.053
think that
in order to sleep at night.

13:52.104 --> 13:53.888
What the hell does that mean?

13:53.939 --> 13:55.640
It means that
I'm not for sale.

13:55.724 --> 13:57.358
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

13:57.425 --> 13:59.310
Hey.

13:59.394 --> 14:00.561
Forget it.

14:08.270 --> 14:09.203
Is that Sam's face?

14:09.271 --> 14:11.205
Yep. Yours, too.

14:12.624 --> 14:14.542
Don't act so surprised.

14:14.609 --> 14:17.128
After getting bullied so much,
I took up boxing.

14:17.212 --> 14:18.829
I also started the Dalton
branch of Fight Club,

14:18.914 --> 14:24.252
which I obviously
can't talk about!

14:24.303 --> 14:26.137
What is your problem
with me, anyway?!

14:26.221 --> 14:28.673
Ever since I got here, you've
given me nothing but crap.

14:31.126 --> 14:33.678
Honestly, dude,
I was kind of jealous.

14:33.762 --> 14:36.397
I felt threatened.

14:36.464 --> 14:39.433
Your talent kind of
freaked me out,

14:39.484 --> 14:41.602
made me question whether or not
I was good enough.

14:41.653 --> 14:45.239
Look, Blaine, I'm sorry.

14:45.307 --> 14:48.426
Uh, I've been acting
like a jackass to you.

14:48.493 --> 14:51.195
With Rachel gone,
you're the most

14:51.280 --> 14:53.648
talented, well-rounded member
of this team.

14:53.715 --> 14:56.417
And now more than ever,
we need to be on the same page.

14:56.485 --> 14:58.586
United.

15:00.372 --> 15:02.623
Tell me what you need me to do.

15:02.674 --> 15:04.258
We have an opportunity.

15:04.326 --> 15:06.294
An opportunity to be remembered
at this school

15:06.345 --> 15:08.763
for the rest of our lives
for doing the impossible.

15:08.830 --> 15:12.350
But it all starts right here,
with you and me.

15:12.434 --> 15:15.469
I just want to be able to look
across that stage at you

15:15.520 --> 15:20.057
and know that we did
everything we could.

15:20.142 --> 15:22.059
No regrets.

15:29.284 --> 15:30.985
Let's get back to work.

15:32.687 --> 15:33.704
All right.

15:36.124 --> 15:37.575
What are you doing?

15:37.659 --> 15:39.193
Holding your hand.

15:39.244 --> 15:40.077
Don't.

15:40.162 --> 15:41.078
Sam, look, I...

15:41.163 --> 15:42.630
I heard about your boyfriend.

15:42.697 --> 15:45.366
Then you heard he's
built like a bulldozer.

15:48.587 --> 15:50.504
We had a summer fling.
It was more than that.

15:50.555 --> 15:53.424
I'll always have a special place
in my heart for you,

15:53.508 --> 15:56.427
but... I've moved on.

15:56.511 --> 15:58.512
And you need to do the same.

16:01.716 --> 16:04.235
I don't care how big
or bad your boyfriend is.

16:04.319 --> 16:06.070
I'm gonna fight
to get you back.

16:19.138 --> 16:20.639
<i>What's this?
A bootleg of
West Side Story.</i>

16:20.723 --> 16:22.641
Starring your son.

16:22.725 --> 16:25.026
You missed
the performance,

16:25.094 --> 16:27.579
but I thought you should see how
truly incredible Mike was in it.

16:27.647 --> 16:29.364
Go. Take that with you.

16:29.432 --> 16:30.365
Are you sure?

16:30.433 --> 16:32.033
'Cause if you saw it,

16:32.101 --> 16:34.736
then maybe you'd realize
that Mike's throwing

16:34.787 --> 16:38.573
everything he loves away
just to please you.

16:38.624 --> 16:40.942
And if you don't make it right,
he's going to spend

16:40.993 --> 16:42.828
the rest of his life
doing something he hates,

16:42.912 --> 16:44.546
dying inside.

16:44.613 --> 16:46.281
Tina...

16:46.332 --> 16:48.250
sit.

16:48.301 --> 16:49.334
Please.

16:54.340 --> 16:56.224
You want to be a performer, too?

16:57.677 --> 16:59.428
And your parents support this?

16:59.479 --> 17:00.679
They love me.

17:00.763 --> 17:01.796
They love you,

17:01.848 --> 17:02.848
but they're not honest with you.

17:02.932 --> 17:03.849
And you children,

17:03.916 --> 17:06.435
you think you know everything,

17:06.486 --> 17:08.904
but this path
you've chosen, Tina,

17:08.971 --> 17:10.704
the one you want
Mike to choose, too,

17:10.772 --> 17:13.692
there'll be such heartache.

17:13.776 --> 17:15.861
So few opportunities for you.

17:15.944 --> 17:17.496
I know. I've heard the jokes.

17:17.579 --> 17:18.646
I better hope they do

17:18.698 --> 17:19.830
<i>a musical of The Joy Luck Club</i>

17:19.915 --> 17:20.866
<i>or Memoirs of a Geisha.</i>

17:20.950 --> 17:22.501
I don't care.

17:22.585 --> 17:24.118
Performing is
what I need to do--

17:24.170 --> 17:25.619
same as your son.

17:25.671 --> 17:27.255
And it may be hard,

17:27.323 --> 17:29.207
but it's what we were
born to do.

17:40.686 --> 17:42.904
You know, you're always
talking about honor,

17:42.972 --> 17:44.339
Mr. Chang.

17:44.390 --> 17:48.193
Help your son honor his gift.

17:53.149 --> 17:57.452
♪ La, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la, la ♪

17:57.520 --> 18:00.688
♪ La, la, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la ♪

18:00.740 --> 18:02.541
Okay, guys,
you're going to want to sing

18:02.625 --> 18:04.409
from your diaphragm
as much as you can.

18:04.494 --> 18:06.745
And if you forget the words,
just keep your lips moving.

18:06.829 --> 18:08.380
Hopefully, nobody
will notice.

18:08.464 --> 18:10.532
Let's take a few moments
to gather our thoughts.

18:10.583 --> 18:12.417
Trouble Tones
are on in five.

18:12.502 --> 18:15.036
Good luck out there.

18:15.087 --> 18:17.205
What?
Why would you try
and talk to my dad?

18:17.256 --> 18:18.873
You're making things worse.

18:18.925 --> 18:20.509
He almost didn't
let me come today.

18:20.560 --> 18:21.760
I'm really disappointed
in you, Tina.

18:21.844 --> 18:23.011
Well, that makes
two of us,

18:23.062 --> 18:24.045
'cause I'm really
disappointed in you.

18:24.096 --> 18:26.047
Hello, Will.

18:26.098 --> 18:28.683
Looking good, ladies!

18:28.734 --> 18:30.885
We just came to say,
may the best glee club win.

18:30.937 --> 18:33.488
Yes, and just in case
that glee club is us,

18:33.556 --> 18:36.724
I have convinced Miss Corcoran
to consider a contingency plan.

18:36.776 --> 18:38.726
Yes, in the event
of a New Directions! loss,

18:38.778 --> 18:40.061
Trouble Tones has voted

18:40.112 --> 18:41.997
to allow any of you
to join us at Regionals.

18:42.064 --> 18:43.798
You're welcome.
Excuse me?

18:43.866 --> 18:45.083
That's incredibly
rude, Santana.

18:45.167 --> 18:47.419
We're being nice.
It would be rude if I

18:47.503 --> 18:48.903
followed you around
and every time you took a step,

18:48.955 --> 18:51.172
I played a note on a tuba.

18:51.240 --> 18:53.041
Thank you for the offer,
Miss Corcoran, but right now,

18:53.092 --> 18:54.709
we're gonna concentrate
on winning this thing.

18:54.760 --> 18:56.411
And we will be winning, Shelby.

18:56.462 --> 18:57.912
We've got it in the bag.

18:57.964 --> 19:00.748
Puck here is going to
come through for us.

19:00.800 --> 19:02.934
He's such a shining star,
in every conceivable way.

19:03.019 --> 19:03.885
Don't you think?

19:06.055 --> 19:07.973
Good luck, everybody.

19:08.057 --> 19:09.524
See you on the ice.

19:16.816 --> 19:17.949
Sad?

Where are you going?

21:59.061 --> 22:00.945
Aren't you supposed to be
in the auditorium?

22:01.030 --> 22:03.314
I saw you leave the auditorium.
I know what you're gonna go do.

22:03.399 --> 22:05.283
You're gonna go tell Figgins
about Shelby and Puck.

22:05.367 --> 22:06.735
I'm an adult.

22:06.786 --> 22:08.119
I can do
whatever I want.

22:08.204 --> 22:09.738
If you want to be
a destructive force

22:09.789 --> 22:11.122
in the universe,
that's your business, okay,

22:11.207 --> 22:13.158
but can you just please
at least wait until after

22:13.242 --> 22:14.993
the Trouble Tones perform?
Why?

22:15.077 --> 22:17.078
Because we don't want
to wreck all the hard work

22:17.129 --> 22:19.330
that our friends in that group
put into their performance.

22:19.415 --> 22:22.300
So we win.
No, not like that.

22:22.384 --> 22:25.220
Look, just... if you're going
to go through with this,

22:25.287 --> 22:27.255
you owe it to Shelby
to tell her first.

22:27.306 --> 22:28.973
It's the adult thing to do.

22:33.345 --> 22:37.298
I got a taste of what it's like
to do the wrong thing.

22:37.349 --> 22:39.801
Okay? And it feels awful.

22:47.793 --> 22:50.096
Does she have a temperature?
Okay, forget it. I'll be home in an hour.

22:53.132 --> 22:55.283
Looks like I'm going
to be missing

22:55.334 --> 22:57.635
my own victory party.
Puck told me about you two.

22:57.720 --> 22:59.954
I'm going to tell Figgins
and get you fired.

23:01.507 --> 23:02.724
I'm ending it.

23:02.791 --> 23:04.476
Not that there's

23:04.560 --> 23:06.561
that much "it" to end.

23:06.628 --> 23:07.628
You shouldn't have
come here with her.

23:07.680 --> 23:08.813
I would have been fine.

23:08.898 --> 23:10.515
What you did was wrong.

23:10.599 --> 23:11.516
What you're doing with Puck
is wrong.

23:14.103 --> 23:16.738
You're so young... pretty...

23:16.805 --> 23:17.939
Don't talk down to me.

23:17.990 --> 23:19.691
It goes away, you know.

23:19.775 --> 23:21.910
Not the pretty--
you'll always be pretty--

23:21.977 --> 23:24.045
but the young.

23:24.113 --> 23:26.848
It happens really slow,
and you don't even notice it,

23:26.916 --> 23:28.550
and then, one day...

23:28.617 --> 23:31.786
everything just feels different.

23:31.837 --> 23:33.171
I can't wait to feel different.

23:33.255 --> 23:34.956
Don't wish away your life.

23:35.007 --> 23:36.791
You're exactly
where you're supposed to be.

23:38.627 --> 23:39.794
I think I thought
that being with an 18-year-old

23:39.845 --> 23:41.096
would make me feel 18 again,

23:41.163 --> 23:44.766
but mostly, it just
made me feel even older.

23:48.671 --> 23:50.805
All right.

23:50.856 --> 23:53.608
I'm going to enjoy my last
few hours of being a teacher.

23:55.311 --> 23:58.063
I recommend that you enjoy
being up on that stage.

23:58.147 --> 23:59.848

This is what I was missing!

35:04.734 --> 35:06.067
I just...
I can't believe it.

35:06.135 --> 35:08.687
I can't believe
he actually came.

35:08.771 --> 35:10.355
He stood and...

35:10.439 --> 35:11.573
Michael.

35:11.640 --> 35:14.242
May I speak
with you?

35:14.310 --> 35:15.710
Both of you?

35:15.778 --> 35:18.363
Dancing is your talent,
your dream.

35:18.447 --> 35:20.665
That's what
you tried to tell me.

35:20.750 --> 35:22.517
That's what you
tried to tell me.

35:22.585 --> 35:24.869
And that's what
I saw tonight.

35:24.954 --> 35:27.872
This is your path, son,
so you must follow it,

35:27.957 --> 35:29.624
and make us proud.

35:29.692 --> 35:31.159
And your mother
and I, we will

35:31.210 --> 35:33.762
help you follow it
however we can.

35:33.829 --> 35:37.198
Apply to dance schools--
the best ones.

35:38.718 --> 35:39.834
Dad...

35:47.860 --> 35:51.279
Dad, I... I missed
the deadlines, I think.

35:51.347 --> 35:52.897
No, you didn't.

35:52.982 --> 35:56.151
I sent in your applications,
just in case.

35:56.202 --> 35:59.687
I kind of had to forge
your signature, though.

35:59.739 --> 36:03.041
I love you so much.

36:11.968 --> 36:14.419
As an award-winning clown,
I'd like to say

36:14.503 --> 36:17.205
that it's nice, for once,
to be working with kids

36:17.256 --> 36:18.757
that are just sick with talent.

36:21.811 --> 36:24.346
Third place-- The Unitards!

36:29.652 --> 36:30.885
Harmony...

36:30.936 --> 36:33.154
Hi. I just wanted
to tell you

36:33.222 --> 36:34.306
that I thought you
were really amazing.

36:34.373 --> 36:35.890
And just think,
I'm only a sophomore

36:35.941 --> 36:37.325
and I'm already this good.

36:37.393 --> 36:38.743
Next year's going
to be a bloodbath.

36:57.129 --> 36:58.346
In second place...

37:00.582 --> 37:02.217
...we have the Trouble Tones!

37:02.268 --> 37:04.686
In first place
is New Directions!

♪ ♪

37:50.066 --> 37:51.900
Well, my suspension
is officially over.

37:51.967 --> 37:54.235
It'll still be on
my transcript, though.

37:54.303 --> 37:55.854
I'm just hoping that

37:55.938 --> 37:57.906
the admissions department
at NYADA sees it

37:57.973 --> 37:59.691
as a sign of my artistic,
rebellious, attitude.

37:59.775 --> 38:00.942
Good luck with that.

38:00.993 --> 38:04.028
Are you going to go tell
Figgins about Shelby?

38:04.113 --> 38:05.697
'Cause I just...
I still think

38:05.781 --> 38:07.198
that it's a really
terrible idea.

38:07.283 --> 38:09.284
I came here to talk
to you, actually.

38:09.335 --> 38:11.286
To tell you I'm not
going to tell.

38:11.337 --> 38:13.288
Why?

38:13.339 --> 38:16.374
Because I love Beth, and I don't
want to ruin her life.

38:16.459 --> 38:17.792
I wanted to thank you actually.

38:17.843 --> 38:19.594
For what?

38:19.661 --> 38:22.263
For keeping me from
doing something stupid.

38:22.331 --> 38:24.232
Something I would have regretted
my entire life.

38:26.552 --> 38:28.970
We're kind of friends, huh?

38:29.021 --> 38:30.939
Kind of.

38:31.006 --> 38:34.609
What do you
think about Yale?

38:34.676 --> 38:37.178
Oh, no, I have my
sights set on NYADA.

38:37.229 --> 38:39.814
No, for me.

38:39.865 --> 38:41.349
I'm not the singer
that you and Kurt are,

38:41.400 --> 38:43.952
but Yale has an amazing
drama program.

38:44.019 --> 38:47.489
And I really do
like to perform.
Yeah.

38:47.540 --> 38:50.825
Certainly would nail all the
parts where the girl has to cry.

38:50.876 --> 38:52.494
No, I think it's a great idea.

38:52.545 --> 38:54.963
I mean, especially since you
won't have me to compete with.

38:56.298 --> 38:58.249
You're a lot better
than you know.

39:00.052 --> 39:02.837
Well, I'll see you
at Glee Club.

39:02.888 --> 39:05.706
Where are you going?
I have a couple people
I need to talk to.

39:05.758 --> 39:07.175
Okay, well, I don't know

39:07.226 --> 39:11.212
if you need help with
your Yale application...

39:11.263 --> 39:12.547
Not with the Yale application,

39:12.598 --> 39:14.899
but, um, there is something
you could do for me.

39:16.885 --> 39:19.020
We were better.
I don't know, I think it
could have gone either way.

39:19.071 --> 39:20.388
It was that damn Trouty Mouth.

39:20.439 --> 39:22.723
Even I felt a little
something in my lady loins

39:22.775 --> 39:24.776
when he did that
magic sex dance.

39:24.860 --> 39:27.728
All right, ladies,
girl talk.

39:27.780 --> 39:30.615
No. Uh-uh. Don't you dare try
and give us a pep talk.

39:30.699 --> 39:33.618
Or ask us to come back to New
Directions-- not interested.

39:33.702 --> 39:35.670
Wait, is it even possible?
Do you think they would

39:35.737 --> 39:37.005
really take us back?
Of course they would
take us back.

39:37.072 --> 39:38.623
But I'm telling you,
I'm not going.

39:38.707 --> 39:41.042
Do you know what growing up
is about?

39:41.093 --> 39:42.510
Losing things.

39:42.578 --> 39:45.413
In six months, we'll
all be gone, scattered.

39:45.481 --> 39:47.348
We'll keep in touch.

39:47.416 --> 39:48.883
Yeah, but it
won't be the same.

39:48.934 --> 39:51.085
When we see each other,
it'll be a special occasion.

39:51.136 --> 39:52.387
It'll be different.

39:52.454 --> 39:55.056
I don't want to grow up yet.

39:55.107 --> 39:57.192
I'm not ready
to lose you girls.

39:57.259 --> 39:58.926
What are we supposed to do?

39:58.978 --> 40:01.479
Come back to Glee Club and sing
background for Blaine and Berry

40:01.564 --> 40:03.764
until we graduate?
I'm not doing that again.

40:03.816 --> 40:06.100
We know what it feels like
to be out front now.

40:06.151 --> 40:08.903
What if Mr. Shue agreed
to let the Trouble Tones

40:08.954 --> 40:11.272
sing at least one number
per competition?

40:11.323 --> 40:14.409
Well, even if Mr. Shue did agree
to that, Rachel never would.

40:14.460 --> 40:16.995
What if I told you that
they both already did?

40:17.079 --> 40:18.913
I'm listening.

40:18.964 --> 40:20.448
Look, I know I went
a little crazy.

40:20.499 --> 40:22.967
But I'm here now.

40:23.052 --> 40:25.253
I'm 17-- I have the rest
of my life in front of me.

40:25.304 --> 40:26.454
I love Glee Club.

40:26.505 --> 40:28.590
I love you girls.

40:28.657 --> 40:33.144
And when we're 27, or 87,

40:33.229 --> 40:35.513
I want us to be able to look
back on these next couple months

40:35.598 --> 40:39.651
and talk about how it was
the best times of our lives.

40:39.735 --> 40:42.153
Can't do that if we're
not all together.

40:44.440 --> 40:46.641
We're doing a big number
in the auditorium

40:46.692 --> 40:49.244
to celebrate our victory
and to prepare for Regionals.

40:49.311 --> 40:51.646
We could use a couple
more girl voices.
