WEBVTT

00:12.512 --> 00:13.763
[Fallon] Which one says,

00:13.847 --> 00:17.100
"green energy mogul
who's ready to change the world"?

00:17.183 --> 00:18.810
Um, I wanna say green?

00:18.893 --> 00:20.145
Blue suit it is.

00:20.228 --> 00:21.062
Happy to help.

00:21.146 --> 00:25.191
But happier to report that Stacey's
baby shower gift has arrived.

00:25.275 --> 00:26.317
[gasps]

00:27.736 --> 00:28.570
It's perfect.

00:28.653 --> 00:29.863
She's gonna love it.

00:29.946 --> 00:33.408
I can't believe that our baby shower
is tomorrow.

00:33.491 --> 00:35.452
-It doesn't feel real.
-Seriously?

00:35.535 --> 00:37.746
We just spent the last week
answering questions

00:37.829 --> 00:41.249
about teacake towers
and flower meadows from Alexis.

00:41.332 --> 00:43.126
Feels a little too real to me.

00:43.209 --> 00:47.130
Don't worry.
Tomorrow is all about our baby and us.

00:47.213 --> 00:51.009
Yes. And today is all about you
and our baby's future.

00:51.593 --> 00:53.303
How does it feel to be one hour away

00:53.386 --> 00:55.638
from launching
your first hydroelectric power plant?

00:55.722 --> 00:57.682
Surprisingly,
not too different from yesterday.

00:57.766 --> 01:00.393
But also, one step closer
to reaching my goal

01:00.477 --> 01:05.231
of transforming Fallon Unlimited
into a climate-positive company.

01:05.315 --> 01:07.442
It's been a magical year, hasn't it?

01:07.525 --> 01:09.527
I feel so at peace.

01:09.611 --> 01:12.155
Which is new for me, but let's go with it.

01:12.989 --> 01:15.116
A letter for Mrs. Carrington.

01:15.700 --> 01:18.328
Okay. I guess knocking is optional now.

01:19.412 --> 01:20.246
Thank you.

01:21.706 --> 01:22.791
-[gasps]
-What?

01:22.874 --> 01:24.459
It's from the Forbes Visionary Summit.

01:24.542 --> 01:27.087
It's like the Met Gala but for business.

01:27.170 --> 01:29.506
Blake used to get invited all the time.

01:29.589 --> 01:32.634
[gasps] They've put me
on the short list to be a speaker.

01:32.717 --> 01:35.345
After today,
you'll be the only one on that list.

01:36.471 --> 01:38.264
This place is amazing.

01:38.348 --> 01:40.892
Sam, you should be really
proud of what you've built here.

01:40.975 --> 01:42.227
I am.

01:42.310 --> 01:45.104
-I think I'm ready to do it again.
-Build another hotel?

01:45.188 --> 01:48.441
I wasn't planning on franchising,
but the perfect property across town

01:48.525 --> 01:49.776
-is about to hit the market.
-Oh.

01:49.859 --> 01:52.946
I just need Culhane to weigh in
or at least reply to my texts.

01:53.029 --> 01:53.863
Anyway...

01:55.073 --> 01:56.074
this was fun.

01:56.157 --> 01:57.659
-Mm-hm.
-Again.

01:57.742 --> 01:58.576
I agree.

01:58.660 --> 01:59.744
Again.

01:59.828 --> 02:03.039
Though can I ask what this is?

02:03.665 --> 02:08.711
I mean, are you just looking for fun
or something more?

02:09.879 --> 02:11.381
What am I looking for?

02:11.464 --> 02:13.716
-Uh...
-[pensive music playing]

02:13.800 --> 02:18.388
You know, I'm looking for something more.

02:18.471 --> 02:20.932
And something fun.

02:21.015 --> 02:22.725
Something more fun.

02:22.809 --> 02:27.564
Sam, I don't think that I can do the fun
without the more.

02:27.647 --> 02:30.567
So why don't you think about it,

02:30.650 --> 02:34.445
and then maybe we'll revisit it
at dinner tomorrow night?

02:38.658 --> 02:39.492
[groans]

02:39.576 --> 02:44.914
I told Johan anything sage-adjacent plays,
but these are just far too blue.

02:45.874 --> 02:48.293
Well, maybe we should just nix them.

02:48.376 --> 02:49.627
Well, I suppose.

02:49.711 --> 02:51.796
All right,
send them to the sea creature room.

02:52.630 --> 02:54.465
Are we done being mad at each other?

02:54.549 --> 02:56.467
'Cause I can hardly bear it.

02:57.635 --> 02:58.595
Um...

03:00.054 --> 03:01.431
What about the floral rattles?

03:01.514 --> 03:04.976
Ah, yes, those go by the storybook stacks.
Kirby.

03:05.059 --> 03:07.729
This takes me back
to when I was starting a family.

03:07.812 --> 03:10.481
Sadly, showers like this
weren't yet de rigueur.

03:10.565 --> 03:11.816
[Amanda] Still aren't in London.

03:11.900 --> 03:15.028
If you ever plan on throwing one for me,
tone it down a wee bit.

03:15.111 --> 03:17.322
[Kirby] You wanna raise kids in London?

03:17.405 --> 03:19.741
I always pictured having a family here
or in Australia even.

03:19.824 --> 03:22.493
Ooh. Australia. How lovely.
You should go right now.

03:22.577 --> 03:25.288
Let's get back to the party
that's happening tomorrow.

03:25.371 --> 03:28.166
Mother, did you find the info
for Anders' champagne dealer?

03:28.249 --> 03:29.542
Unfortunately not.

03:29.626 --> 03:32.003
But I have full confidence you will.

03:32.086 --> 03:33.379
Tobias, no.

03:33.463 --> 03:36.466
The manatee does not belong
in the fairytale forest.

03:37.842 --> 03:39.844
Why do you need my dad's contact?

03:39.928 --> 03:42.597
Fallon's requested some rare champagne
for the shower.

03:42.680 --> 03:44.641
I'll take care of it. You have enough.

03:44.724 --> 03:46.517
No, it's okay. I'll figure it out.

03:46.601 --> 03:47.727
Please, I wanna help.

03:47.810 --> 03:50.438
I still have a few tricks up my sleeve
from my party planning days.

03:50.521 --> 03:52.982
Yeah, that's what I'm worried about.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.777
Ever since you used my name
to threaten a nurse,

03:55.860 --> 03:57.862
I don't know what tricks you might use.

03:57.946 --> 04:01.074
I'm making sure I don't get reprimanded
for something I didn't even do.

04:01.157 --> 04:03.117
I know, and I'm sorry.

04:03.201 --> 04:05.787
Please let me do this for you
so we can go back to normal.

04:05.870 --> 04:09.040
Fine. This isn't for me, remember?
It's for Fallon.

04:09.123 --> 04:11.125
I won't let either of you down.

04:11.876 --> 04:13.878
[men speaking indistinctly]

04:14.837 --> 04:16.464
There's the esteemed author.

04:16.547 --> 04:17.382
Jasper?

04:17.465 --> 04:19.550
-What are you doing here?
-Sorry to ambush you.

04:19.634 --> 04:21.552
I didn't know how to reach you.
We need to talk.

04:21.636 --> 04:23.972
Okay. What, about the writing program?

04:24.055 --> 04:26.516
No. About how I was cleaning out
my uncle's office

04:26.599 --> 04:30.436
and found letters to a publisher
about his new novel but no manuscript.

04:30.520 --> 04:31.437
Seemed weird.

04:31.521 --> 04:33.022
Maybe he kept it somewhere else.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.315
I wondered that too.

04:34.399 --> 04:38.111
But then I saw a press release for your
new book with an oddly similar summary.

04:38.194 --> 04:41.155
We can discuss whatever it is
that you're implying later.

04:41.239 --> 04:42.907
There's nothing to discuss.

04:42.991 --> 04:44.617
Unless you want your career ruined,

04:44.701 --> 04:47.370
you're gonna buy me a penthouse
fit for a Carrington.

04:47.453 --> 04:49.580
And pay a big finder's fee.

04:49.664 --> 04:51.332
Call me when you're done.

04:51.416 --> 04:53.418
[tense music playing]

04:59.173 --> 05:00.216
[sighs]

05:01.259 --> 05:02.427
[Fallon] Are you okay?

05:03.011 --> 05:04.262
Huh? Yeah. I'm fine.

05:04.345 --> 05:06.723
Okay, good.
I need you in position and focused.

05:06.806 --> 05:08.850
Focused? I'm just holding
one end of a ribbon, right?

05:08.933 --> 05:11.394
When it comes to a ribbon cutting,
that's kind of essential.

05:11.477 --> 05:13.021
So remember, after I cut the ribbon,

05:13.104 --> 05:15.773
the turbines will roar to life
and everyone will cheer.

05:15.857 --> 05:17.692
-Okay.
-Then and as we exit, the band plays,

05:17.775 --> 05:21.946
and you and I will smile and wave
like renewable energy royalty, okay?

05:23.656 --> 05:25.825
[over PA] Hello, hello, hello.

05:25.908 --> 05:28.494
Thank you so much for coming.

05:28.578 --> 05:32.457
It has been a rigorous six months
from conception to completion,

05:32.540 --> 05:34.625
but I am proud to finally announce

05:34.709 --> 05:39.130
that Morell Green
Hydro Power Plant has officially...

05:40.173 --> 05:41.132
launched!

05:41.215 --> 05:42.467
-[both] Whoo!
-[crowd applauding]

05:44.385 --> 05:45.678
-[rumbling]
-[people yell]

05:45.762 --> 05:47.972
[Liam] Is that smoke supposed to be black?

05:48.056 --> 05:49.140
[Fallon] No. No, it's not.

05:49.223 --> 05:50.349
Band, come on.

05:50.433 --> 05:51.684
Whoo! Let's play!

05:51.768 --> 05:53.936
[band playing up-tempo music]

05:54.020 --> 05:56.105
Someone is going to pay for this.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.732
And it better not be me.

05:58.858 --> 06:00.318
[Cristal] Is something wrong?

06:00.401 --> 06:03.446
A PPA airplane
has gone missing mid-flight.

06:03.529 --> 06:05.656
Missing? How is that even possible?

06:05.740 --> 06:07.909
A single-pilot aircraft

06:07.992 --> 06:09.786
moving military cargo

06:09.869 --> 06:11.579
left this morning for Alaska.

06:11.662 --> 06:14.123
They had a defense contractor
and a financier on board.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.666
Because of their military clearance,

06:15.750 --> 06:18.336
they were given permission
to stay off the major radar towers.

06:18.419 --> 06:20.630
They just went missing from PPA's system.

06:20.713 --> 06:22.173
Have you called the FAA yet?

06:22.256 --> 06:23.674
Are you insane?

06:23.758 --> 06:26.052
We just narrowly escaped
Adam's P.R. scandal.

06:26.135 --> 06:28.137
No matter what's going on,
this cannot go public.

06:28.221 --> 06:32.308
-You're assuming it's still in flight?
-Until I get evidence otherwise? Yeah.

06:32.809 --> 06:34.769
I know someone who could find that plane

06:34.852 --> 06:36.896
and he's motivated
to do it quickly and quietly.

06:36.979 --> 06:39.607
When we find the plane,
we will help it land.

06:39.690 --> 06:41.484
What if the plane crashed?

06:41.567 --> 06:43.569
[ominous music playing]

06:44.362 --> 06:47.406
I have an elite search and rescue team
standing by.

06:48.491 --> 06:50.118
I have a friend at the FAA.

06:50.952 --> 06:52.537
Put that phone down.

06:53.329 --> 06:55.832
I'm taking the lead on this.
End of discussion.

06:56.290 --> 06:57.125
Wow.

06:57.708 --> 07:00.378
If "end of discussion"
is where we're at these days,

07:00.461 --> 07:02.338
I want nothing to do with this.

07:03.005 --> 07:05.007
[dramatic music playing]

07:14.559 --> 07:16.811
ColbyCo tech on board
is fully operational,

07:16.894 --> 07:18.938
but I couldn't establish communication.

07:19.021 --> 07:21.315
-There's gotta be a backdoor in.
-I've tried everything.

07:21.399 --> 07:24.110
Including the plane's transponder
and the ACAR system.

07:24.193 --> 07:26.154
I can't connect to either.

07:28.197 --> 07:32.160
Which means this plane is flying dark
against FAA regulations.

07:32.243 --> 07:35.580
You know, I agreed to come here
to help with a ColbyCo tech glitch,

07:35.663 --> 07:39.959
-not whatever shady scheme you're running.
-Look, I was hoping it was just a glitch.

07:40.042 --> 07:43.504
I couldn't risk discussing
the full picture with you over the phone.

07:43.588 --> 07:45.756
You need to tell me
what the hell's going on right now.

07:45.840 --> 07:49.760
We had FAA approval
to fly dark on this flight.

07:50.344 --> 07:53.306
But the plane vanished
off of our system a few hours ago.

07:53.389 --> 07:54.599
I need you to locate it.

07:54.682 --> 07:56.017
How do you suggest I do that?

07:56.100 --> 07:58.769
Hack into the towers
along the plane's flight path,

07:58.853 --> 08:01.564
scan for a ping
without tipping off the FAA.

08:01.647 --> 08:04.192
Is that all? That could take a whole day,
if not longer.

08:04.275 --> 08:06.068
I'm aware.
Which is why we should get started.

08:06.152 --> 08:08.279
Best case scenario,
it's just a comms malfunction,

08:08.362 --> 08:09.363
they're still in the air.

08:09.447 --> 08:11.365
Worst case, they've gone down somewhere

08:11.449 --> 08:13.784
and we're looking
for a needle in a haystack.

08:13.868 --> 08:15.495
[dramatic music playing]

08:15.578 --> 08:16.787
[Sam] What does this card mean?

08:16.871 --> 08:18.956
These snakes alongside the red lion

08:19.040 --> 08:21.375
mean there's some steamy love
coming into your life.

08:21.459 --> 08:22.835
Great.

08:22.919 --> 08:26.214
Does one of those snakes
maybe have a name I might recognize?

08:26.297 --> 08:28.883
The universe, not the cards,
will give you that answer.

08:28.966 --> 08:31.761
Unless you'd like a star chart reading.

08:31.844 --> 08:35.264
I'm pretty booked,
but I can find time in the next day or so.

08:35.348 --> 08:36.891
For a rush fee, of course.

08:36.974 --> 08:38.059
Whatever it takes.

08:38.726 --> 08:40.061
Text me the results?

08:41.646 --> 08:42.897
Was that Ms. Cassidy?

08:42.980 --> 08:44.106
This can't be good.

08:44.190 --> 08:45.066
It's not.

08:45.149 --> 08:47.026
Ryan wants to DTR.

08:47.109 --> 08:48.653
"Define the relationship."

08:48.736 --> 08:50.363
I just needed some advice on what to do.

08:50.446 --> 08:52.532
Because if you wait too long,
you could miss your shot.

08:52.615 --> 08:53.699
Exactly.

08:54.492 --> 08:56.994
Like the situation with that spot
I've been texting you about.

08:57.078 --> 08:58.287
Right, that.

08:58.371 --> 09:01.207
I've been kind of distracted
with relationship stuff too.

09:01.290 --> 09:04.835
Except, unlike you,
I know I don't wanna date Nina anymore.

09:06.003 --> 09:06.921
I wanna marry her.

09:07.004 --> 09:10.216
My God, you really need to work
on your dramatic pauses.

09:10.299 --> 09:12.051
What I need to work on is my proposal.

09:12.134 --> 09:14.804
-I don't know how to make it special.
-Say no more.

09:14.887 --> 09:17.390
This is clearly a job
for your best friend.

09:18.224 --> 09:19.392
-Me.
-Oh.

09:23.521 --> 09:24.355
Graham.

09:25.147 --> 09:26.691
Kirby, hey.

09:26.774 --> 09:28.401
Ah, look at us.

09:28.484 --> 09:31.654
First the blood drive,
then the garden party, and now here.

09:31.737 --> 09:33.364
I know, we have to stop meeting like this.

09:33.447 --> 09:35.241
I'm not stalking you, I swear.

09:35.324 --> 09:39.412
Turns out a broken ankle requires
a lot of physical therapy. Who knew?

09:39.912 --> 09:41.539
Based on the bouquet, I'm guessing

09:41.622 --> 09:43.749
you and your girlfriend
still haven't worked things out.

09:43.833 --> 09:46.210
Mm. Yeah, not yet.

09:46.294 --> 09:48.713
Which is why I needed to
step up my apology game

09:48.796 --> 09:50.590
and offered to try
and find a rare champagne.

09:50.673 --> 09:53.175
Didn't realize "rare" meant
"impossible to get."

09:53.259 --> 09:56.637
-What varietal are we talking?
-1820 Juglar Cuvee.

09:56.721 --> 09:58.681
Yeah, that's a tricky one.

09:58.764 --> 10:01.142
It's nice to know her taste in champagne

10:01.225 --> 10:03.185
is as good as her taste in women.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.646
It's actually for Fallon, but thank you.

10:05.730 --> 10:08.733
So... I can't promise this will fix
your girlfriend issue,

10:08.816 --> 10:11.986
but I think I can help
with your champagne problem.

10:12.069 --> 10:13.362
Really? How?

10:13.446 --> 10:17.450
Before I was a full time PT patient,
I was a personal concierge.

10:17.533 --> 10:19.994
I've had to find far rarer things
than vintage champagne.

10:20.077 --> 10:21.203
You'd really do this for me?

10:21.287 --> 10:25.333
I've been itching to dip a toe,
with my good ankle,

10:25.416 --> 10:26.667
back into the hospitality pool.

10:26.751 --> 10:29.128
This is a perfect chance
to flex that muscle again.

10:30.212 --> 10:33.382
So the penstock is clear.
What about the generator valve?

10:34.216 --> 10:35.176
Hmm.

10:35.259 --> 10:36.135
Look at that.

10:36.218 --> 10:38.554
There's a misalignment in Surge Tank 2.

10:38.638 --> 10:41.015
Must've been too much pressure
for it to handle.

10:41.098 --> 10:42.516
Cracking under pressure.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.602
Not unlike this entire enterprise.

10:44.685 --> 10:46.520
Ten out of ten entrance, Ellen.

10:46.604 --> 10:49.231
-The problem has been located.
-It's too late for that.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.400
This project is out of money and time.

10:51.484 --> 10:55.112
We need to shutter the plant before
the new fiscal quarter begins tomorrow.

10:55.196 --> 10:56.447
As far as I can tell,

10:56.530 --> 10:59.533
we still have a little bit of money left
and 12 hours before the quarter ends.

10:59.617 --> 11:01.869
Technically, yes,
but if anything else goes wrong,

11:01.952 --> 11:04.747
you'll jeopardize the project
from ever happening.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.457
-[cell phone chiming]
-Excuse me.

11:06.540 --> 11:08.709
-Any updates on our numbers?
-[Fallon] Hey, uh, Gil,

11:08.793 --> 11:12.171
is 12 hours enough time to reinstall
the valve and fix the pressure?

11:12.254 --> 11:16.425
Maybe. Look, I'm off the clock,
and, uh, not exactly motivated.

11:16.509 --> 11:17.968
Would the remainder of our budget

11:18.052 --> 11:21.680
and two season tickets to the Atlantics
help your motivation at all?

11:21.764 --> 11:24.725
You make it four tickets
and, uh, I'll try to rev up my engines.

11:24.809 --> 11:28.062
There is too much at stake
to simply try, Gil.

11:28.145 --> 11:31.065
Trying will not clean up this planet
for my child.

11:31.148 --> 11:34.485
So I don't care about revving up
your engines, just fix this one.

11:34.568 --> 11:36.570
[lively music playing]

11:38.072 --> 11:39.281
Ignore it.

11:40.408 --> 11:41.242
Yeah.

11:41.784 --> 11:44.286
Well, I guess I could stay at La Mirage.

11:44.370 --> 11:46.497
Or maybe I'm banished from there as well.

11:46.580 --> 11:48.999
Don't be such a sad sack.

11:49.083 --> 11:51.585
Your dad gave you a week
to figure out what's next.

11:51.669 --> 11:53.671
And you're not banished from the family.

11:53.754 --> 11:55.840
You can fix things down the line.

11:55.923 --> 11:57.883
Plus you still got me.

11:57.967 --> 12:00.428
Yeah. Thank you for being so patient

12:00.511 --> 12:02.555
and helping me keep everything
in perspective.

12:02.638 --> 12:06.267
That's what I'm here for,
patience and perspective.

12:08.269 --> 12:12.231
I almost forgot my insect exoskeleton
collection in the library.

12:12.314 --> 12:13.691
-I'll be right back.
-Mm-hm.

12:15.901 --> 12:17.903
[tender music playing]

12:25.578 --> 12:27.413
[ominous music playing]

12:31.542 --> 12:34.587
[Adam]
Just a few drops of this. It's saline.

12:36.046 --> 12:37.423
What the hell is this?

12:41.343 --> 12:42.970
It's weird to be back here.

12:44.263 --> 12:45.639
I almost forgot.

12:46.390 --> 12:48.601
Never found out
who was behind the break-in.

12:48.684 --> 12:49.518
I hear you.

12:49.602 --> 12:52.897
But between me and the new
security system, you're safe.

12:52.980 --> 12:55.149
Plus my team's almost done
with the report,

12:55.232 --> 12:58.611
so soon we'll have a better idea
if this is some random incident

12:58.694 --> 13:00.154
or something else.

13:00.237 --> 13:03.741
I know you're doing everything
by the book. I appreciate it,

13:03.824 --> 13:05.659
especially since
I need to get back to work

13:05.743 --> 13:07.203
if I'm going to secure that building.

13:07.286 --> 13:09.705
Why don't we just stick with the routine?

13:09.788 --> 13:11.957
I'll spend the night here on the couch.

13:12.041 --> 13:15.294
So all you have to do is just
focus on locking down that store.

13:16.337 --> 13:19.131
I think that would help a lot, actually.

13:19.215 --> 13:20.049
Thank you.

13:20.132 --> 13:21.175
You're welcome.

13:21.258 --> 13:25.471
But I choose where we
order the pizza from, obviously.

13:26.347 --> 13:28.349
-Deal.
-[cheerful music playing]

13:28.432 --> 13:31.143
Just be sure to keep the pineapple
on your side of the pie.

13:31.227 --> 13:32.353
-Yeah.
-[chuckles]

13:32.436 --> 13:33.437
[Sam] Okay.

13:34.438 --> 13:35.731
Let's begin.

13:35.814 --> 13:40.945
Ask your favorite person
in all the galaxies at the planetarium.

13:41.028 --> 13:44.740
She'll only have stars in her eyes for you
after this dreamy proposal.

13:44.823 --> 13:47.409
-Eh...
-Or if that's too straightforward...

13:47.493 --> 13:49.119
[electronic dance music playing on TV]

13:49.203 --> 13:52.289
...wow her
with a classic interactive drag show.

13:54.166 --> 13:57.253
Of course,
you can always go for nostalgia.

13:57.336 --> 13:58.754
[crowd cheering on TV]

13:58.837 --> 14:03.008
Give her a jumbo ring
on the kiss cam at an Atlantics game.

14:03.092 --> 14:06.595
You do realize I'm proposing to Nina
and not you, right?

14:06.679 --> 14:09.473
This all seems a little big.

14:11.934 --> 14:12.851
Okay.

14:12.935 --> 14:15.062
I can see why
that's your initial reaction.

14:15.145 --> 14:17.731
Look, I'm clearly off my game, all right?

14:17.815 --> 14:20.526
Why is Ms. Cassidy
taking so long with my star chart?

14:21.068 --> 14:22.903
I mean, it's a simple question.

14:22.987 --> 14:24.864
Is Ryan my soul mate?

14:24.947 --> 14:27.157
[upbeat pensive music playing]

14:27.241 --> 14:28.158
You're right.

14:28.242 --> 14:30.953
It is a simple question.

14:31.912 --> 14:35.875
Ha! I think I know
what I'm gonna do with Nina.

14:35.958 --> 14:37.751
I told you my method works.

14:37.835 --> 14:39.420
Good news,

14:39.503 --> 14:41.338
assistant filling in for Betty.

14:41.422 --> 14:45.134
The plant is fully operational
and Morell is back on track.

14:45.217 --> 14:47.428
-Did Ellen ever get a hold of you?
-No.

14:47.511 --> 14:49.013
I didn't have any service at the plant.

14:49.096 --> 14:51.056
I'm sure she was just calling
to congratulate me.

14:51.140 --> 14:52.474
Yeah, I don't think so.

14:52.558 --> 14:55.144
Uh, she and the board have been
in a closed-room meeting

14:55.227 --> 14:57.396
-for the last 20 minutes.
-What?

15:01.108 --> 15:02.192
[Ellen] We need to act fast.

15:02.276 --> 15:04.528
What's going on? Why wasn't I invited?

15:04.612 --> 15:06.196
We're in triage mode here.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.532
There have been power outages
across the company.

15:08.616 --> 15:11.118
FSN has been off the air for half an hour

15:11.201 --> 15:14.955
and a Tempo Universal live music event
just went dark.

15:15.039 --> 15:18.417
Your plant shenanigans clearly triggered
a move to the green grid early,

15:18.500 --> 15:20.044
and now we are hemorrhaging money.

15:20.127 --> 15:22.546
Maybe you can take it down a notch, Ellen.

15:22.630 --> 15:27.259
Losing one concert and 30 minutes
of cardigan sales is hardly a hemorrhage.

15:27.343 --> 15:28.886
It's barely a paper cut.

15:28.969 --> 15:30.721
[electricity powering down]

15:30.804 --> 15:32.222
[indistinct chatter]

15:32.306 --> 15:33.349
You were saying?

15:33.432 --> 15:36.143
No, no, no.
This has nothing to do with the plant.

15:36.226 --> 15:38.354
Everything was fine when I left Gil.

15:38.437 --> 15:40.064
We've crunched the numbers,

15:40.147 --> 15:43.776
and the only way to recoup our losses
is to sell off Morell.

15:43.859 --> 15:45.152
That's not gonna happen.

15:45.235 --> 15:48.072
Shareholders' confidence is plummeting
as fast as the power at that plant.

15:48.155 --> 15:50.366
We need to be bold
if we don't want our stock to nosedive.

15:50.449 --> 15:54.954
You need to show you're not a liability
as CEO by closing the sale publicly.

15:55.037 --> 15:57.873
We already have
a potential buyer lined up.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.417
-And if I say no?
-Then we still sell Morell,

16:00.501 --> 16:03.587
and your CEO title will be in jeopardy.

16:03.671 --> 16:05.506
[tense music playing]

16:07.716 --> 16:11.512
-Wow. You really are my hero.
-My old contact came through.

16:11.595 --> 16:12.721
[Kirby] I owe you big time.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.015
In that case,
can I work the party tomorrow?

16:15.099 --> 16:17.059
I could use some extra cash.

16:17.142 --> 16:19.853
Actually, they do need a new majordomo.

16:21.063 --> 16:22.773
I don't know.

16:22.856 --> 16:25.901
[chuckles]
I've worked for high-end clients, but--

16:25.985 --> 16:27.194
They'll love you.

16:27.277 --> 16:28.112
It's perfect.

16:28.195 --> 16:30.906
Once Amanda sees all this champagne,
she's gonna forgive me.

16:30.990 --> 16:34.284
And you and I
will both be where we belong.

16:34.368 --> 16:38.372
-We're running out of time.
-I'm almost done initiating the auto scan.

16:38.455 --> 16:42.835
This system only hits one tower at a time
so it could still miss the plane.

16:42.918 --> 16:45.212
-If the plane is even in the air.
-If we don't get a ping

16:45.295 --> 16:48.424
or that plane doesn't land on schedule,
I'll have to contact the defense company

16:48.507 --> 16:52.720
and the passenger's people
with a cover story to buy us more time.

16:52.803 --> 16:55.723
It's amazing how easy it is
for you to lie.

16:55.806 --> 16:57.266
But I have another way of doing this.

16:57.349 --> 16:59.768
If I manually cycle down
the plane's power remotely,

16:59.852 --> 17:00.894
when it cycles back up,

17:00.978 --> 17:04.064
it should reconnect the ACAR system
allowing us to track the flight.

17:04.148 --> 17:06.567
If you cycle the power down,
it'll kill the engines.

17:06.650 --> 17:07.484
Briefly.

17:07.568 --> 17:10.362
But any competent pilot
can deal with a short engine failure.

17:10.446 --> 17:14.450
It's too risky. It could cause a crash
that would end PPA forever.

17:15.576 --> 17:17.327
Or is that what you want?

17:17.411 --> 17:18.996
[tense music playing]

17:19.079 --> 17:21.373
The odds of a crash are infinitesimal.

17:21.457 --> 17:25.085
And if you actually think
I would let people die just to spite you,

17:25.169 --> 17:26.795
you are sicker than I thought.

17:26.879 --> 17:27.838
We're done here.

17:27.921 --> 17:30.257
The auto-scan can ping
for the towers without your help.

17:30.340 --> 17:34.053
So you're gonna prioritize your own ego
over other people's lives?

17:34.136 --> 17:37.264
Hey, like I said, you can go now.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.229
Ta-da!

17:44.313 --> 17:47.024
The bounty of bubbly you requested,
my darling.

17:47.107 --> 17:48.984
You ask, I deliver.

17:49.068 --> 17:52.946
-Thank you. How'd you pull it off?
-Well, I had a little help from Graham.

17:53.030 --> 17:55.240
He heard about our predicament
and called in a favor.

17:55.324 --> 17:58.327
[Graham] Kirby has been such an angel
at the hospital with her volunteer work,

17:58.410 --> 18:00.162
and I know how much she wanted to help.

18:00.245 --> 18:01.663
So I made some calls.

18:01.747 --> 18:04.291
Uh, well, thank you, Graham.

18:04.374 --> 18:07.753
Uh, it's really lovely to meet you,
but I'm drowning in tasks,

18:07.836 --> 18:09.088
so excuse me.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.593
I can't believe this.

18:14.676 --> 18:16.553
She's acting like I killed her goldfish.

18:16.637 --> 18:18.597
Seriously. Wait, did you?

18:18.680 --> 18:22.142
-No. Though I am terrible with pets.
-Good to know.

18:22.226 --> 18:23.936
How many times do I need to apologize?

18:24.019 --> 18:25.562
How many gestures does she want?

18:25.646 --> 18:28.232
The crime doesn't match the time,
you know?

18:29.274 --> 18:30.109
I...

18:31.068 --> 18:33.153
don't mean to state the obvious,

18:33.237 --> 18:36.865
but... maybe you could
just ask her what's going on?

18:36.949 --> 18:40.077
Because her attitude
clearly isn't about champagne

18:40.160 --> 18:42.704
or whatever it is
you think she's mad about.

18:43.497 --> 18:44.581
You're right.

18:44.665 --> 18:45.916
As usual.

18:45.999 --> 18:49.670
Which is exactly why
you'd make the perfect majordomo here.

18:51.171 --> 18:53.674
Watch out! Giant cake coming through.

18:53.757 --> 18:56.718
Oh! I'm sorry, Mr. Carrington.
I didn't see you there.

18:56.802 --> 18:59.221
It's your kitchen, Mrs. Gunnerson.
I'm just a visitor.

18:59.304 --> 19:03.100
Why is it that there's 15 varieties
of granola and not a single box of--?

19:03.183 --> 19:04.893
-[Fallon] These?
-[Blake] Oh.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.398
Rough day?

19:09.481 --> 19:11.150
No. I just had a hankering.

19:14.194 --> 19:15.195
[Blake] Ah.

19:16.405 --> 19:17.698
The whole box?

19:18.198 --> 19:20.742
I know why I'm stress eating.
What's your excuse?

19:20.826 --> 19:24.079
[sighs] I'll spare you the details.
But there were a few hiccups at work,

19:24.163 --> 19:28.208
and now the board needs a sacrificial lamb
for the shareholders.

19:28.292 --> 19:30.586
It's either gonna be me or Morell.

19:30.669 --> 19:33.088
Losing Morell may seem unfathomable,

19:33.172 --> 19:36.466
but keeping Fallon Unlimited
and the support of the board,

19:36.550 --> 19:38.427
that will soften the blow every time.

19:38.510 --> 19:40.929
You're right. I know it's my only option.

19:41.013 --> 19:43.932
Though I do think it might kill
my Forbes Summit invite.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.309
You were invited?

19:45.392 --> 19:47.811
Would it help if I tell you
those things are really boring?

19:47.895 --> 19:50.397
No, because I know you'd be lying.

19:50.480 --> 19:53.775
When you won your summit visionary award
all those years ago,

19:53.859 --> 19:56.320
I made it my mission to get an invite too.

19:56.987 --> 19:59.031
I think I just wanted to impress you.

19:59.114 --> 20:02.701
I was so proud
to see my father get recognized.

20:03.702 --> 20:05.954
I want my child
to feel that about me one day.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.080
It'll happen.

20:07.164 --> 20:08.373
You have plenty of time.

20:08.457 --> 20:09.708
Unlike this dinosaur.

20:09.791 --> 20:11.084
Dinosaur?

20:11.168 --> 20:13.587
You built an airport from scratch.

20:13.670 --> 20:16.548
You merged empires with a female CEO.

20:16.632 --> 20:18.258
You partnered with a titan of tech.

20:18.342 --> 20:22.095
In many ways, you're more of a visionary
now than you ever were back then.

20:22.596 --> 20:26.975
Okay, I think my baby-to-be
is making me uncomfortably sentimental.

20:27.059 --> 20:27.976
I'm gonna go.

20:36.109 --> 20:38.654
Oh. I could get used to this.

20:38.737 --> 20:40.781
You should sleep here every night.

20:41.657 --> 20:43.200
On the couch.

20:43.283 --> 20:47.246
You could rebrand yourself
the bodyguard-barista.

20:47.329 --> 20:48.789
-Anyway...
-[cell phone chimes]

20:48.872 --> 20:51.166
...what's the update
on your team's report?

20:51.917 --> 20:54.211
Looks like the evidence just came in.

20:54.294 --> 20:57.256
And they think the break-in
was just a one-time incident.

20:57.339 --> 20:58.674
And I agree.

20:59.299 --> 21:00.926
Well, I trust your judgment.

21:01.009 --> 21:02.636
FSN does as well.

21:02.719 --> 21:07.140
They've decided to end my assignment.

21:07.224 --> 21:09.476
What happens when the next crazy fan
comes around?

21:09.559 --> 21:13.230
Well, I'm always just a phone call away
if you ever feel uncomfortable.

21:14.064 --> 21:14.898
So...

21:17.025 --> 21:20.028
does that mean you're not going to be
my bodyguard anymore?

21:20.112 --> 21:21.321
It does.

21:21.405 --> 21:23.115
Which means we can finally do this.

21:23.198 --> 21:25.200
[sensual music playing]

21:26.576 --> 21:27.744
I like that.

21:30.163 --> 21:31.123
Off.

21:31.957 --> 21:33.709
[laughing]

21:34.876 --> 21:36.878
[ominous music playing]

21:40.841 --> 21:42.092
[Kevin] As a professional,

21:42.175 --> 21:46.763
I have to advise you a hollowed-out book
is not the safest place to hide valuables.

21:46.847 --> 21:49.349
You're not wrong,
considering whoever broke into my home

21:49.433 --> 21:52.811
stole the hard drive
I was keeping safe for Jeff.

21:52.894 --> 21:54.062
Hard drive?

21:54.146 --> 21:57.482
He split the codes
for his new Solar Project

21:57.566 --> 22:00.986
onto two hard drives
for an extra precaution.

22:01.069 --> 22:03.322
No one should have even known
I had it here.

22:03.405 --> 22:06.074
Okay, well, thank you, Betty.
Just prep the final contracts

22:06.158 --> 22:07.784
and we'll talk later. Okay.

22:07.868 --> 22:10.454
No. No, no, I recognize that look.

22:10.537 --> 22:11.788
Whatever it is, shelve it.

22:11.872 --> 22:13.999
-Do not make me throw that phone out.
-I'm done.

22:14.082 --> 22:15.834
-I'm done, I promise.
-Good.

22:15.917 --> 22:18.712
Because today is your first baby shower.

22:18.795 --> 22:22.674
Oh! You should be jittery with butterflies
and tastefully drunk on champagne.

22:22.758 --> 22:24.885
At least, that's how I was
when I was pregnant with you.

22:24.968 --> 22:28.263
-Something you shouldn't brag about.
-You can reacquire companies

22:28.347 --> 22:30.599
and rebuild equity
for the rest of your life,

22:30.682 --> 22:33.602
but you can never relive days like today.

22:34.102 --> 22:35.854
These are the moments that count.

22:35.937 --> 22:38.899
It's like my own personal
Meow Wolf down there.

22:39.524 --> 22:43.070
-I couldn't love it more.
-The inspiration was all you.

22:44.029 --> 22:47.157
It's like a breathtaking fairy tale,

22:47.240 --> 22:50.160
like the life you and Liam
are building for yourselves.

22:50.243 --> 22:53.038
Well, I will savor every insane detail.

22:53.121 --> 22:56.208
And you are hired to throw
the baby's first birthday party.

22:56.291 --> 23:00.003
Although you could've gone 50% less
on, well, everything.

23:00.087 --> 23:02.672
-Oh, I wanted to go 75% more.
-Hm.

23:02.756 --> 23:04.633
You'll see soon enough.

23:04.716 --> 23:07.094
You don't hold back
when it comes to your kids.

23:07.677 --> 23:10.639
Yeah, you were right.
I was protecting my ego.

23:11.264 --> 23:13.767
But there are three people still missing,
possibly in danger.

23:13.850 --> 23:15.769
And I don't need to fix everything myself.

23:15.852 --> 23:17.979
-So there's no new news.
-No.

23:18.980 --> 23:21.149
But look, I'm... sorry.

23:22.067 --> 23:24.528
Uh, I acted like a jerk.

23:25.487 --> 23:27.948
Yeah, whatever.
We can worry about that later.

23:28.031 --> 23:29.407
Right now, let's find that plane.

23:29.491 --> 23:31.409
It disappeared 26 hours ago.

23:31.493 --> 23:34.037
So even with the airport towers
we've eliminated,

23:34.121 --> 23:35.997
we're back to
the needle in a haystack theory.

23:36.081 --> 23:38.041
We don't even know
what condition they're in.

23:38.125 --> 23:40.293
-I know they're alive. They have to be.
-Yeah, well,

23:40.377 --> 23:44.464
either way, they're not in the air,
so powering down isn't a risk anymore.

23:44.548 --> 23:48.426
I can reset the ACARS,
but I need your authorization codes.

23:48.510 --> 23:51.471
Yeah, of course. Whatever it takes.

23:52.097 --> 23:54.808
Good. Because it may take a miracle.

23:55.475 --> 23:57.102
[tense music playing]

24:00.188 --> 24:02.732
-[cell phone buzzing]
-[suspenseful music playing]

24:02.816 --> 24:03.733
[Jeff] Not now.

24:05.652 --> 24:07.612
Okay. I'm ready to cycle down.

24:07.696 --> 24:08.905
It's not a sure bet, but--

24:08.989 --> 24:11.324
-Well, it's the only bet we've got.
-Yeah.

24:13.994 --> 24:14.911
Well?

24:16.621 --> 24:17.998
It worked.

24:18.540 --> 24:21.168
The ACARS is online.
I'm getting a ping right now.

24:21.251 --> 24:22.669
Okay, where's the plane?

24:22.752 --> 24:26.256
Ping is coming from a tower
in the Appalachians.

24:26.339 --> 24:29.843
And these coordinates
should get your rescue team

24:29.926 --> 24:31.761
within 200 miles of the plane.

24:33.013 --> 24:35.056
[Blake] Send it to my guys right now.

24:35.140 --> 24:36.141
[message sends]

24:37.517 --> 24:38.768
Well done.

24:38.852 --> 24:39.811
Yeah.

24:42.189 --> 24:43.398
Thank you.

24:44.357 --> 24:46.860
[tense pensive music playing]

24:53.825 --> 24:56.536
Look, I meant what I said earlier.
I acted like a jerk.

24:56.620 --> 24:59.414
Yeah, you did.
All that matters is we found the plane.

24:59.497 --> 25:03.460
Yeah. And even though
we don't always act like it, we're...

25:03.543 --> 25:05.795
We're family, and that matters too.

25:06.421 --> 25:08.465
The possibility of losing PPA
made me a little--

25:08.548 --> 25:11.635
Irrational? Yeah, look, I get it.

25:11.718 --> 25:14.304
I went to a really dark place
when I lost ColbyCo.

25:14.387 --> 25:17.515
-Maybe we're not all that different.
-Oh, yeah, we are.

25:17.599 --> 25:20.393
And one apology
does not equal a clean slate.

25:21.561 --> 25:23.939
That said, we all gotta start somewhere.

25:24.981 --> 25:28.068
Maybe, uh, this could be
that somewhere for us.

25:32.364 --> 25:33.448
[Kirby] <i>I know you're mad.</i>

25:33.531 --> 25:36.868
I don't know what else I can say
or do to show you how sorry I am.

25:36.952 --> 25:40.664
I'm not mad.
I'm just processing what you did.

25:41.915 --> 25:43.083
It surprised me.

25:43.166 --> 25:44.834
-It was one mistake.
-I know.

25:44.918 --> 25:47.921
But yesterday you were talking about
how you want to move back to Australia.

25:48.004 --> 25:51.299
And I just-- I figured out
what was really bothering me.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.260
We're eight months into our relationship.

25:53.343 --> 25:56.346
I feel like we should know more
about each other.

25:56.429 --> 25:58.932
I'm an open book.
What do you want to know?

25:59.015 --> 26:01.059
Sure, but where am I in that book?

26:01.142 --> 26:03.436
Do I fit into
what you want for your future?

26:03.520 --> 26:04.980
Do you fit into mine?

26:05.605 --> 26:07.440
I haven't really thought about it.

26:07.524 --> 26:09.067
Just kind of enjoying the moment.

26:09.150 --> 26:12.487
Right. That's just it. I've mapped out
what I want to do in my life

26:12.570 --> 26:15.073
and my career,
and it's just not really your style.

26:15.156 --> 26:17.325
You've had, like,
three jobs in the past year alone.

26:17.409 --> 26:20.495
Ouch. I didn't realize
my lack of career was such a problem.

26:20.578 --> 26:22.455
No, sorry. That's not what I meant.

26:22.539 --> 26:23.581
It's okay.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.128
You're right. We should talk
about where we're going.

26:28.211 --> 26:30.755
Though probably not
in the middle of a baby shower.

26:31.381 --> 26:33.133
Yeah, [clears throat] exactly. So...

26:34.301 --> 26:35.552
talk later.

26:35.635 --> 26:36.720
Yeah.

26:42.726 --> 26:44.144
Let's see what it is.

26:45.312 --> 26:49.524
Ah. Yes. Um, yet another engraved spoon.

26:50.692 --> 26:53.778
-You really shouldn't have.
-Let's hope our kid never needs a knife.

26:53.862 --> 26:54.779
Huh?

26:56.531 --> 26:58.199
Alanis? No one?

26:58.283 --> 27:02.245
Let's put a pause on the presents
and bring out the cake.

27:02.329 --> 27:03.413
[crowd applauding]

27:04.664 --> 27:07.334
Feels a little weird wiping my mouth
with a picture of baby Liam.

27:07.417 --> 27:08.543
-It is a little weird.
-Yeah.

27:08.626 --> 27:11.504
Alexis wanted to do the same
for me and Steven at our shower,

27:11.588 --> 27:13.173
but he wouldn't let her.

27:13.256 --> 27:14.382
Feels like a lifetime ago.

27:14.466 --> 27:15.759
[glass clinking]

27:15.842 --> 27:19.304
We would actually like to make a toast.
So can everybody grab a glass?

27:20.221 --> 27:22.891
Vodka gimlet, fresh lime,
for Mrs. Carrington.

27:22.974 --> 27:26.186
And Gin Martini, extra olives,
for Mr. Jones.

27:26.269 --> 27:27.395
Oh, thank you.

27:27.479 --> 27:30.315
I don't know who you are,
but you can make drinks for me anytime.

27:30.398 --> 27:31.441
I'm Graham.

27:31.524 --> 27:34.152
And Kirby did mention
there was an opening?

27:34.235 --> 27:37.238
Oh. You're the one
she's been talking my ear off about.

27:37.322 --> 27:39.908
You're really interested
in the majordomo position?

27:39.991 --> 27:42.786
-If you'll consider me.
-Like I said, you're hired.

27:43.620 --> 27:45.622
Well, I don't really have hiring power.

27:45.705 --> 27:48.041
-That's Blake's area.
-Today it's mine.

27:48.124 --> 27:50.085
I don't need Blake's approval.

27:50.168 --> 27:53.755
So I say we give you a two-week trial
and see how that works.

27:53.838 --> 27:55.048
Sound good?

27:55.131 --> 27:56.132
Perfect.

27:56.216 --> 27:59.677
I just wanted to--
Well, we wanted to thank Alexis,

27:59.761 --> 28:04.265
Kirby, and Amanda
for planning this wonderful event.

28:04.349 --> 28:08.228
We feel very grateful
that we get to share it with all of you.

28:08.311 --> 28:11.564
And none of this would be possible
without one person.

28:11.648 --> 28:13.316
The key to the rest of our lives.

28:13.400 --> 28:15.652
Stacey, could you come up here?

28:24.577 --> 28:26.579
That one is sort of symbolic,

28:26.663 --> 28:30.041
but there is an actual key
to the Manor in there.

28:30.625 --> 28:32.168
You're part of the family now.

28:32.252 --> 28:34.421
And you'll always have a home here.

28:34.504 --> 28:36.256
I don't even know what to say.

28:36.798 --> 28:40.427
Thank you so much
for making me part of this journey.

28:40.510 --> 28:44.556
And, um, don't worry,
I won't come to breakfast every morning.

28:44.639 --> 28:46.099
[guests laughing]

28:46.182 --> 28:49.936
Whoa. I think we should let the baby
do the rest of the talking.

28:50.019 --> 28:51.479
-Aw.
-[Stacey] Yeah.

28:52.021 --> 28:55.233
Oh, my it feels like she is wearing
six-inch stilettos in there.

28:55.316 --> 28:57.736
[cheerful pensive music playing]

28:57.819 --> 28:59.988
-Did you just say "she"?
-Did I?

29:00.822 --> 29:01.865
Um...

29:01.948 --> 29:03.283
Are we having a girl?

29:05.326 --> 29:08.455
Yes. Oh, yes, they're having a girl!

29:08.538 --> 29:09.956
[guests cheering]

29:15.754 --> 29:19.466
She is so lucky to have two amazing

29:19.549 --> 29:22.135
and forgiving parents.

29:22.218 --> 29:23.428
So sorry.

29:25.847 --> 29:27.766
-We're having a daughter.
-This is crazy.

29:27.849 --> 29:30.685
I know I said it felt real before,
but now it's really real.

29:30.769 --> 29:33.021
I know, it does.
We're having a little girl.

29:33.104 --> 29:35.690
A real human being
who's gonna need our help

29:35.774 --> 29:38.067
navigating this complicated world.

29:38.151 --> 29:40.612
That definitely changes the perspective.

29:40.695 --> 29:42.447
[guests applauding and cheering]

29:42.530 --> 29:44.532
[cheerful poignant music playing]

29:50.622 --> 29:52.665
-You have a pep in your step.
-Ah!

29:53.625 --> 29:55.251
My best bud is about to propose,

29:55.335 --> 29:56.920
and Miss Cassidy just confirmed

29:57.003 --> 29:59.631
that the love coming into my life
is a Scorpio.

30:00.256 --> 30:02.175
AKA, Ryan's stripper name.

30:02.258 --> 30:04.427
If that's not a sign,
I don't know what is.

30:04.511 --> 30:08.056
As dependable as a $5000-a-day psychic is,

30:08.139 --> 30:10.183
make sure this is how you feel.

30:10.266 --> 30:11.309
It is.

30:11.392 --> 30:13.102
But let's focus on you.

30:14.187 --> 30:15.355
[clears throat]

30:16.231 --> 30:17.482
Good evening.

30:17.565 --> 30:19.234
What is all of this?

30:20.735 --> 30:22.195
It's my way of making up

30:22.278 --> 30:24.447
for canceling our movie plans last night.

30:24.531 --> 30:27.075
Totally unnecessary, but sweet.

30:27.617 --> 30:30.119
Wait until you see the show.

30:35.083 --> 30:37.085
[beeping]

31:09.993 --> 31:12.203
of anything in my life.

31:12.287 --> 31:13.830
[tender music playing]

31:14.873 --> 31:16.040
Will you marry me?

31:17.375 --> 31:19.460
With absolute certainty...

31:22.088 --> 31:23.006
yes.

31:24.549 --> 31:25.800
Whoo!

31:36.895 --> 31:38.146
Hey, what happened?

31:38.229 --> 31:40.106
I thought we were having dinner
at the boathouse?

31:40.189 --> 31:42.567
We were. Until I found this.

31:44.235 --> 31:45.612
What is that?

31:45.695 --> 31:48.781
Oh, this, just the atropine
I found in your bag.

31:49.949 --> 31:51.534
Why were you going through my bag?

31:51.618 --> 31:54.871
If you must know,
I was leaving you a cute little note.

31:54.954 --> 31:57.373
And then I saw this
and realized it's what you gave me

31:57.457 --> 31:59.792
-the day I collapsed.
-Stacey, I'm a doctor.

31:59.876 --> 32:02.879
Of course I have medicine in my bag.
I have plenty of other medications.

32:02.962 --> 32:04.672
This doesn't mean anything.

32:04.756 --> 32:06.049
I asked my doctor friend,

32:06.132 --> 32:09.844
and she thinks it's weird that
you happened to have atropine that day,

32:09.928 --> 32:11.930
as if you knew
something was going to happen.

32:12.013 --> 32:14.766
Even weirder
that you lied and said it was saline.

32:14.849 --> 32:16.351
No, Stacey, I can explain every--

32:16.434 --> 32:18.519
It wasn't even that hot. So it's strange.

32:18.603 --> 32:20.813
I had heat stroke,
but I do remember feeling sick

32:20.897 --> 32:23.316
after I drank some of that tea
you gave me.

32:23.399 --> 32:26.486
My friend also said that atropine
can be used to treat mushroom poisoning,

32:26.569 --> 32:28.863
which can look a lot like heat stroke.

32:28.947 --> 32:31.157
I know it was the tea, Adam.

-but I don't want anything to do with you.
-No. No, no, no.

32:38.039 --> 32:39.666
Please, I'm sorry. You have to believe me.

32:39.749 --> 32:41.292
You were never in danger.

32:41.376 --> 32:43.753
I'd never put you or the baby at risk.

32:43.836 --> 32:45.797
Sometimes I make irrational decisions

32:45.880 --> 32:48.007
especially when I think
I'm gonna lose everything--

32:48.091 --> 32:49.509
Well, now you have!

32:49.592 --> 32:51.678
I never want to see you again.

32:52.679 --> 32:55.723
We can fix this.
Nobody else has to know anything.

32:56.683 --> 32:59.602
Considering I already told someone,
it's a little too late.

[footsteps]

33:01.771 --> 33:04.732
I was really rooting for you,

-Your time is up.
-Let me--

33:06.442 --> 33:09.112
You're never to step foot
in this house again,

33:10.989 --> 33:12.991
[dramatic music playing]

33:17.745 --> 33:19.706
So I, uh, put a lot of thought

33:19.789 --> 33:22.333
into what you asked about what I want...

33:22.417 --> 33:23.251
And?

33:23.334 --> 33:26.212
And then I realized
it shouldn't take this much thought.

33:26.295 --> 33:28.631
You know, I want to say yes.

33:28.715 --> 33:30.883
But there's still something
holding me back.

33:31.509 --> 33:34.512
You deserve someone
who won't hesitate to go all in.

33:36.055 --> 33:38.349
You're just too special for anything less.

33:39.851 --> 33:42.270
-Wow.
-I'm so sorry, Ryan.

33:42.979 --> 33:46.649
I mean, Sam, obviously, I'm disappointed,

33:47.525 --> 33:50.111
but, uh, I appreciate the honesty.

33:53.239 --> 33:55.616
I think we both
deserve that all-in person.

34:02.457 --> 34:03.916
-Bye.
-Bye.

34:08.421 --> 34:10.840
-You okay?
-Remember when you broke up with Geneva

34:10.923 --> 34:14.135
because you knew it was the right thing,
even though you didn't want to?

34:14.218 --> 34:15.053
Say no more.

34:15.136 --> 34:16.846
-Sorry, brother.
-Yeah.

Maybe this is just a step I needed to take
to find true love, like you did.

I hope so.

-Yeah.

It was my honor
to be there in your big moment.

Even though it did convince me
to say no to Ryan.

34:32.361 --> 34:35.114
Actually, can we change the subject?

34:35.740 --> 34:38.993
Maybe talk about that new hotel property?

34:39.077 --> 34:43.623
We can. But I don't think
you're gonna like what I have to say.

34:43.706 --> 34:45.208
Which is why I've been avoiding it.

34:45.291 --> 34:49.212
I can't get involved
in another hotel here in Atlanta...

34:50.421 --> 34:52.715
because Nina and I are moving to L.A.

will be born into.

putting that other buyer in place.

39:45.341 --> 39:47.635

Your ability to snake your way
out of trouble is truly impressive.

39:52.515 --> 39:53.724

You jumped the gun,

until after a new vote...

40:01.524 --> 40:03.734
-to remove you as CEO.
-On what grounds?

40:03.818 --> 40:07.780
I followed your terms. I sold the company
before the end of the quarter.

40:07.863 --> 40:10.908
Yes, but you clearly adjusted
the company's code of conduct

40:10.991 --> 40:12.535
for your own benefit.

40:12.618 --> 40:15.538
Remember when you removed
the bylaw prohibiting management

40:15.621 --> 40:16.997
from poaching assets?

40:17.081 --> 40:21.293
I only added that to protect the company
while Colin was acting as my number two.

40:21.377 --> 40:23.963
So, yes, once I returned, I removed it.

40:24.046 --> 40:28.968
Sadly, the board sees it for the obvious
personal power grab it was.

40:29.051 --> 40:30.678
Ellen, what is your game here?

40:30.761 --> 40:34.390
Well, at first, I was making a play
of my own for Morell,

40:34.473 --> 40:37.726
but after your self-serving
attempt to save it,

40:37.810 --> 40:40.062
you opened the door for me
to take everything.

40:40.146 --> 40:43.274
All I had to do was convince the board
you were in the wrong.

40:43.357 --> 40:44.233
Which I did.

40:45.484 --> 40:47.695
So you sabotaged the grid conversion.

40:48.320 --> 40:52.450
You really think that you can beat me?
You're just a hired lackey.

40:52.533 --> 40:54.910
I made you when I put you on this board.

40:54.994 --> 40:59.582
Now I'm following in your footsteps,
and eventually replacing them.
