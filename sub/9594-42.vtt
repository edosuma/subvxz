WEBVTT

00:26.394 --> 00:28.729
Yeah!
-Beast Boy, Beast Boy.

00:28.762 --> 00:30.464
Huh!

00:30.498 --> 00:31.799
Beast Boy!
-Whoa! Wah!

00:31.832 --> 00:33.534
Get your head
out of the clouds!

00:33.567 --> 00:35.069
Ugh! Oh.

00:35.103 --> 00:36.270
Huh, what's up?

00:36.304 --> 00:37.738
We were asking you
about that sound.

00:37.771 --> 00:40.741
Oh, that's just my new song
I'm working on, mama.

00:40.774 --> 00:41.642
It goes like this...

00:41.675 --> 00:44.112
-Whoa!

00:44.145 --> 00:46.147
-Not that sound.

00:46.180 --> 00:48.282
-That sound.

00:48.316 --> 00:51.152
Oh, you're talking
about my rattle.

00:51.185 --> 00:52.553
Your rattle?

00:52.586 --> 00:54.455
Yeah, that's my sweet rattle.

00:54.488 --> 00:56.424
Check it. Whoa!

00:57.425 --> 00:59.160
Wah!

00:59.193 --> 01:01.595
And how long has your head
been rattling?

01:01.629 --> 01:03.831
I don't know.
Couple of weeks.

01:03.864 --> 01:05.699
What?
Your head doesn't rattle?

01:05.733 --> 01:08.469
Hmm? Let me
see something, Beast Boy.

01:08.502 --> 01:10.471
Cyborg, I'm going
to need a hand.

01:12.606 --> 01:15.176
-I'm like a maraca, yo!
-Yeah, you are!

01:19.313 --> 01:21.149
-ROBIN: Cyborg!
-Sorry.

01:21.182 --> 01:23.251
Beast Boy, I'm afraid
that sound is coming

01:23.284 --> 01:26.254
from brain shrinkage
caused by years of neglect.

01:27.588 --> 01:30.158
You must not neglect
the brain, Beast Boy.

01:30.191 --> 01:33.161
It craves
the information, experience,

01:33.194 --> 01:36.264
and most of all,
it needs to be challenged.

01:36.297 --> 01:37.731
Yeah, I don't do that.

01:37.765 --> 01:39.733
Me and my brain
don't get along.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.535
He's always getting
me in trouble.

01:41.569 --> 01:43.237
How does your brain
get you in trouble?

01:43.271 --> 01:45.473
Ugh! You know how you guys
are always on my case

01:45.506 --> 01:47.508
about my mind wandering
and telling me

01:47.541 --> 01:49.343
to get my head
out of the clouds?

01:49.377 --> 01:51.712
Well, that's my brain's fault.

01:51.745 --> 01:53.013
In fact, he loves
wandering so much,

01:53.046 --> 01:55.416
if he ever got the chance,
he'd probably wander off

01:55.449 --> 01:56.684
and never come back!

01:56.717 --> 01:59.520
That's why I keep him weak,
so he can't escape.

02:00.354 --> 02:01.555
I'm sorry, Beast Boy,

02:01.589 --> 02:03.591
but brain neglect
is unacceptable.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.826
You have to start
using your head.

02:05.859 --> 02:07.428
Use my head?

02:07.461 --> 02:09.697
I'll give it a try.

02:12.533 --> 02:14.235
Ow!

02:14.268 --> 02:16.537
Ahhh!
Ow!

02:20.808 --> 02:21.842
Ah! Oh!

02:24.312 --> 02:25.846
Ah!

02:25.879 --> 02:27.147
Ow!

02:28.416 --> 02:30.451
Ow! Ow!

02:31.352 --> 02:33.421
Ow! Ah!

02:50.538 --> 02:51.805
BEAST BOY: Yo, yo, yo!

02:54.742 --> 02:59.413
I've just been
using my head like you said.

02:59.447 --> 03:01.749
I don't like it.
It hurts.

03:03.617 --> 03:05.819
But I still got
my sweet rattle.

03:07.288 --> 03:10.624
Okay, that's not what
using your head means.

03:10.658 --> 03:12.660
-Gross.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.628
-Ugh!

03:14.662 --> 03:16.797
What about the brain teaser?

03:16.830 --> 03:19.433
Not gonna tease my brain.
He already hates me.

03:19.467 --> 03:21.402
Then, will you at least
consider a hobby?

03:21.435 --> 03:22.836
What's a hobby?

03:22.870 --> 03:25.839
A hobby is an activity that's
a little bit fun for you

03:25.873 --> 03:28.609
and a little bit challenging
for your brain.

03:28.642 --> 03:32.480
Me and my brain
doing something together?

03:32.513 --> 03:35.549
Uh, we'll talk about it.

03:38.952 --> 03:40.654
Yo, brain, what up?

03:40.688 --> 03:44.224
Uh, look,
I brought you something.

03:44.792 --> 03:46.460
It's for you to read!

03:46.494 --> 03:48.762
Ow.

03:51.599 --> 03:53.000
Don't be like that!

03:53.033 --> 03:55.469
I know we haven't
always gotten along.

03:55.503 --> 03:58.472
But the others thought
we should get
a hobby together.

03:59.707 --> 04:01.975
I'm stupid?
Well, you're my brain.

04:02.009 --> 04:04.645
Now I remember
why we don't get along.

04:07.948 --> 04:11.485
Pizza?
You know me so well!

04:11.519 --> 04:13.521
Apology accepted!

04:13.987 --> 04:16.324
Mmm. Ah.

04:16.357 --> 04:19.327
Now, I'm thinking a hobby that
we can do together should be

04:19.360 --> 04:21.962
outdoors and doesn't involve
math, reading, science,

04:21.995 --> 04:24.565
philosophy, debating,
physics, chemistry,

04:24.598 --> 04:25.966
attention to detail,
cleanliness,

04:25.999 --> 04:28.369
too much physical exertion
or meat.

04:28.402 --> 04:29.970
And I wouldn't mind
if it involved digging holes.

04:31.739 --> 04:34.608
Gardening?
That's perfect!

04:34.642 --> 04:36.544
Let's make some plants, yo!

05:03.837 --> 05:04.838
Ah.

05:20.988 --> 05:23.457
How is the new
hobby going, Beast Boy?

05:23.491 --> 05:24.758
It's like a job

05:24.792 --> 05:25.859
but without the pay.

05:25.893 --> 05:27.828
Hobbies are terrible.

05:27.861 --> 05:29.863
You're doing it
for your brain.

05:29.897 --> 05:31.699
Oh, yeah.
That guy.

05:31.732 --> 05:35.102
Anyway, you guys want
a small tomato or
a rotten strawberry?

05:35.135 --> 05:37.638
I know this seems
like a lot of effort
for no reason,

05:37.671 --> 05:38.906
most hobbies are like that,

05:38.939 --> 05:40.841
but listen, do you hear that?

05:40.874 --> 05:44.712
-No.
-Exactly, your rattle's gone.

05:44.745 --> 05:47.815
I liked my sweet rattle!

05:48.482 --> 05:51.118
Whoa!

05:51.151 --> 05:52.820
What happened?

05:52.853 --> 05:54.655
Your brain is getting bigger.

05:54.688 --> 05:57.090
It's going to take some time
to learn to balance
that weight.

05:57.124 --> 06:00.761
I don't know guys.
If my brain gets
too big and strong

06:00.794 --> 06:02.730
what's it going to
need me for?

06:02.763 --> 06:05.933
Whoa!
Ow.

06:08.669 --> 06:10.370
Guys, guys, looks!

06:12.973 --> 06:15.175
Oh, a tree.
Cool!

06:15.208 --> 06:17.611
I wish my head had a tree.

06:17.645 --> 06:19.513
But this is not normal!

06:19.547 --> 06:23.417
Your brain just wants to
get in on that gardening
action too, Beasty.

06:23.451 --> 06:24.752
Oh, how nice!

06:24.785 --> 06:27.988
You and your brain
are becoming the friends.

06:28.021 --> 06:30.891
I don't want my brain
planting stuff in my head!

06:30.924 --> 06:32.192
I don't trust him!

06:33.794 --> 06:35.763
Now help me pull it out.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.734
Beast Boy,
take this tree as a sign

06:40.768 --> 06:42.503
that your relationship
with your brain

06:42.536 --> 06:43.771
is growing stronger!

06:43.804 --> 06:45.806
You will see
that this is a good thing!

06:48.942 --> 06:50.644
You said this would be
a good thing.

06:50.678 --> 06:52.746
How is this a good thing?

06:52.780 --> 06:54.181
I'll tell you how.

06:54.214 --> 06:55.483
Head fruit!

07:00.187 --> 07:01.088
Mmm, mmm!

07:01.121 --> 07:04.124
That is some ripe
and juicy head fruit.

07:04.157 --> 07:06.860
Then you must try
some of the fresh squeezed

07:06.894 --> 07:08.796
head fruit juice I have made.

07:08.829 --> 07:11.865
It only tastes a little like
the Beast Boy.

07:14.568 --> 07:15.636
Ah!

07:15.669 --> 07:17.237
Wow, that is so refreshing!

07:17.270 --> 07:19.840
And you're right,
not too Beast Boy-y this time.

07:19.873 --> 07:22.242
Hey! Who wants to
climb Beast Boy?

07:22.275 --> 07:23.744
I wish to!

07:27.014 --> 07:30.818
Check out the swing I made.
Whee!

07:30.851 --> 07:32.219
CYBORG: Whee!

07:32.252 --> 07:35.623
Titans, now is not the time
for fun and games.

07:35.656 --> 07:37.124
We need to call
a team meeting.

07:37.157 --> 07:39.693
Thank you, Robin.

07:39.727 --> 07:42.229
Up in Beast Boy's
head tree house!

07:43.296 --> 07:44.665
RAVEN: Yeah, love the view!

07:44.698 --> 07:46.967
Come on, shut the trap door.
Okay.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.637
So, I had to call this
super-duper secret meeting

07:49.670 --> 07:53.907
to tell Starfire that someone
she knows has a crush on her.

07:55.876 --> 07:57.645
STARFIRE: Who could it be?

07:57.678 --> 08:00.280
Everyone out of my head
tree house now!

08:02.883 --> 08:06.153
I thinks this hobby
has strengthened
my brain too much.

08:06.186 --> 08:09.222
He's already wandering, trying
to get my head in the clouds.

08:09.256 --> 08:11.725
He's just waiting
for the perfect opportunity
to escape.

08:11.759 --> 08:14.662
And when that happens I don't
think he'll ever come back!

08:14.695 --> 08:17.831
Sheesh, with your attitude
I wouldn't want
to come back either.

08:17.865 --> 08:19.600
I've had enough of this.

08:24.572 --> 08:25.773
I can't get up.

08:27.741 --> 08:29.743
I call dibs on the head swing!

08:29.777 --> 08:32.946
I will gather the head fruits
and prepare a healthy
and hearty breakfast.

08:32.980 --> 08:35.515
I'll head up to the tree house
and... Whoa!

08:37.651 --> 08:39.319
What's wrong with Beast Boy?

08:39.352 --> 08:42.155
Beasty? Beasty!

08:42.189 --> 08:44.157
There's nothing in there!

08:44.191 --> 08:46.794
You mean
his brain wandered, literally?

08:46.827 --> 08:49.029
Yeah, and this tree
was its way out.

08:49.062 --> 08:51.632
Now wonder it wanted Beast Boy
to take up gardening.

08:51.665 --> 08:53.133
Beast Boy was right.

08:53.166 --> 08:55.903
He didn't trust his brain.
And we shouldn't have either!

08:55.936 --> 08:58.038
That head fruit
was good though.

08:58.071 --> 09:00.908
-Super good.
-So juicy.

09:00.941 --> 09:02.876
The juiciest.

09:02.910 --> 09:04.111
Where do you think
his brain went?

09:04.144 --> 09:06.146
Where it always wanted
his head to be.

09:06.179 --> 09:08.949
In the clouds!
Follow me!

09:16.389 --> 09:18.058
Whoa.

09:18.091 --> 09:20.728
Now wonder it wanted
Beast Boy's head
in the clouds.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.796
I'd wanna wander here too.

09:22.830 --> 09:25.232
There!
It is Beast Boy's brain!

09:26.634 --> 09:29.369
Let's get that brain back
down to Earth.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.904
Titans, go!

09:35.943 --> 09:37.678
Careful, he's slippery!

09:37.711 --> 09:39.012
I got him, I got him!

09:39.046 --> 09:40.814
Oh! I don't got him.

09:50.958 --> 09:53.326
Beast Boy's brain
is astonishingly quick.

09:55.062 --> 09:57.197
Slow down!
Dang it!

09:57.230 --> 09:58.231
It's mushy!

10:06.874 --> 10:10.377
Freedom!

10:10.410 --> 10:11.078
Uh, oh.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.947
We lost the Beast Boy's brain.

10:13.981 --> 10:17.184
This is bad, real bad!
What are we gonna do?

10:17.217 --> 10:20.020
For most people, a brain
would be irreplaceable.

10:20.053 --> 10:23.156
But something tells me
Beast Boy is going
to be all right.

10:27.394 --> 10:30.864
Yos, you gots my brain
and my sweet rattle back.

10:32.265 --> 10:35.669
Yes, we sure did.
Everything is back to normal.

10:37.838 --> 10:39.873
We were wrong, Beast Boy.

10:39.907 --> 10:41.274
We should have
listened to you.

10:41.308 --> 10:44.878
But that's why we call you
the smart one.

10:44.912 --> 10:46.113
That's what's up!

10:47.915 --> 10:50.317
Wah! Yeah! Huh!
