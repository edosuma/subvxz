Previously on Love Island...

00:22.560 --> 00:26.560
The islanders face an emotional
decision. <font color="#FFFF00">Who do you want to dump?</font>

00:28.760 --> 00:39.159
<font color="#00FFFF">Kaz and Josh. </font><font color="#11FF11"> Alex and Alexandra.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Alex and Alex. This is a bitch.</font>

00:39.160 --> 00:41.880
<font color="#00FFFF">Laura and Paul. </font><font color="#11FF11"> Alex and Alexandra.</font>

00:50.880 --> 00:52.880
Tonight...

00:55.600 --> 01:01.479
Meet the family. <font color="#FFFF00">What?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">That's my dad!</font>

01:01.480 --> 01:03.720
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, my God, it's my brother!</font>

01:09.160 --> 01:12.760
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, Alex, I'm not sure what show</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you thought you were coming on to.</font>

01:14.320 --> 01:19.680
And one couple goes...
in the final dumping.

01:40.400 --> 01:44.199
Last night, our couples each
nominated another couple to be
dumped.

01:44.200 --> 01:47.880
Those results have been
independently checked and verified.

01:49.320 --> 01:53.719
OK, I counted them twice. Meaning
Alex and Alexandra, Paul and Laura

01:53.720 --> 01:58.080
and Josh and Kaz all face your votes
and risk being dumped tonight.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.719
# I was up late night ballin'

02:01.720 --> 02:04.279
# Almost made you wanna
throw the towel in

02:04.280 --> 02:07.559
# Almost made you wanna trade
the style in... #

02:07.560 --> 02:10.479
<font color="#FFFF00">It's awful. Like, we are all</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">so close.</font>

02:10.479 --> 02:12.839
<font color="#00FFFF">And then you can't even look</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the person in the face.</font>

02:12.840 --> 02:14.399
<font color="#FFFF00">That's what it was.</font>

02:14.400 --> 02:16.119
<font color="#11FF11">I feel really weird this morning.</font>

02:16.120 --> 02:19.639
<font color="#11FF11">Everyone is sort of walking around</font>
<font color="#11FF11">knowing we voted for someone.</font>

02:19.640 --> 02:21.559
<font color="#11FF11">It just feels a little bit sly.</font>

02:21.560 --> 02:25.039
<font color="#11FF11">Because you have put someone at risk</font>
<font color="#11FF11">of leaving the villa.</font>

02:25.040 --> 02:28.319
<font color="#FFFF00">Last night was shit.</font>

02:28.320 --> 02:30.400
<font color="#00FFFF">It was fun. Not.</font>

02:32.177 --> 02:35.176
<font color="#11FF11">Sometimes, you have the best day</font>
<font color="#11FF11">ever.</font>

02:35.177 --> 02:39.976
<font color="#11FF11">You're on such a high and the</font>
<font color="#11FF11">villa... Everyone is happy.</font>

02:39.977 --> 02:43.936
<font color="#11FF11">And then they drop that bombshell</font>
<font color="#11FF11">and</font>

02:43.937 --> 02:45.617
<font color="#11FF11">it almost ruins your day.</font>

02:56.697 --> 02:58.656
I have got some information I need
to communicate.

02:58.657 --> 03:01.096
I have got a phone,
I have got a plan.

03:01.097 --> 03:02.656
<font color="#FFFF00">I have got a text!</font>

03:02.657 --> 03:04.657
<font color="#00FFFF">Uh-oh.</font>

03:13.217 --> 03:15.017
(SCREAMING)

03:16.657 --> 03:19.096
<font color="#11FF11">What?</font>

03:19.097 --> 03:20.976
<font color="#00FFFF">What? </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, my God.</font>

03:20.977 --> 03:24.097
<font color="#11FF11">Our families are coming in? </font><font color="#FFFF00"> No, no,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">no. Big man, what do you mean?</font>

03:27.697 --> 03:29.336
<font color="#11FF11">They are coming in!</font>

03:29.337 --> 03:31.337
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, my God.</font>

03:35.657 --> 03:37.857
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, my God, I just want to cry!</font>

03:40.497 --> 03:45.416
<font color="#00FFFF">Honestly, if my dad comes, if</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">that is actually what is happening</font>

03:45.417 --> 03:48.177
<font color="#00FFFF">after this text, I am just going to</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">be in bits.</font>

03:49.177 --> 03:52.456
<font color="#FFFF00">Come here, I love you.</font>

03:52.457 --> 03:54.937
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm excited to meet your mum and</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">dad.</font>

03:56.977 --> 04:00.136
<font color="#FFFF00">Mate, this is what I have been</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">waiting for.</font>

04:00.137 --> 04:03.656
<font color="#FFFF00">Ah, mate. I am just so happy.</font>

04:03.657 --> 04:06.616
<font color="#FFFF00">I can't wait for Dan to meet my</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">family.</font>

04:06.617 --> 04:08.936
<font color="#FFFF00">I am really excited about it for</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">ages.</font>

04:08.937 --> 04:11.577
<font color="#FFFF00">They are going to love her.</font>

04:12.937 --> 04:14.776
<font color="#00FFFF">Is your dad here?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I don't think so.</font>

04:14.777 --> 04:17.456
<font color="#11FF11">He works five days a week.</font>

04:17.457 --> 04:19.536
<font color="#00FFFF">If your old man came in and started</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">grilling Jack,</font>

04:19.536 --> 04:21.736
<font color="#00FFFF">I would cry with laughter.</font>

04:21.737 --> 04:22.896
<font color="#11FF11">I don't think he will.</font>

04:22.897 --> 04:26.737
<font color="#11FF11">It is work, he would not get time</font>
<font color="#11FF11">off work.</font>

04:30.697 --> 04:34.376
I love family day. I find
the introductions very moving.

04:34.377 --> 04:36.016
"This is Wes, he took me yachting."

04:36.017 --> 04:37.976
"This is Jack, he took me
ballooning."

04:37.977 --> 04:40.576
"This is Alex, he took up my heart,
tore it to shreds

04:40.577 --> 04:42.576
and stamped on the pieces."

04:42.577 --> 04:45.097
<font color="#FFFF00">I am really nervous.</font>

04:46.657 --> 04:49.137
<font color="#00FFFF">I am just scared in case there is</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">anything that I have done wrong.</font>

04:52.977 --> 04:55.937
<font color="#11FF11">Urgh, what is going to happen?</font>

04:58.377 --> 05:01.256
<font color="#FFFF00">You always want to make your parents</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">proud and stuff. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Exactly.</font>

05:01.257 --> 05:03.976
<font color="#FFFF00">If my mum walks in here and she says</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">she is proud, that'll mean</font>

05:03.977 --> 05:06.377
<font color="#FFFF00">nothing else matters,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">do you know what I mean?</font>

05:10.857 --> 05:12.816
<font color="#00FFFF">Who is this?</font>

05:12.817 --> 05:15.577
<font color="#FFFF00">(SCREAMS)</font>

05:17.617 --> 05:19.457
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, my God!</font>

05:27.977 --> 05:31.016
<font color="#11FF11">I love you.</font>

05:31.017 --> 05:33.216
<font color="#00FFFF">Absolutely amazing.</font>

05:33.217 --> 05:35.136
Hi.
<font color="#FFFF00">ALL: Hi.</font>

05:35.137 --> 05:36.536
<font color="#00FFFF">What a treat that was.</font>

05:36.537 --> 05:39.176
<font color="#00FFFF">To have my mum and my sister</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">walk in.</font>

05:39.177 --> 05:42.617
<font color="#00FFFF">It is honestly one of the best days</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">ever.</font>

05:45.817 --> 05:48.256
<font color="#11FF11">I am so proud of you.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">You've done amazing.</font>

05:48.257 --> 05:53.616
<font color="#FFFF00">My dad and my sister are my absolute</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">world and I am just like...</font>

05:53.617 --> 05:56.056
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, I can't believe they came!</font>

05:56.057 --> 05:58.056
<font color="#FFFF00">They were like, "We are so proud of</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you."</font>

05:58.057 --> 06:00.776
<font color="#FFFF00">And I'm like, "Oh, my God!"</font>

06:00.777 --> 06:02.776
<font color="#FFFF00">Can you believe that I am still</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">here?</font>

06:02.777 --> 06:04.056
<font color="#FFFF00">I can't believe I'm still here.</font>

06:04.057 --> 06:08.857
<font color="#00FFFF">You've done absolutely amazing. We</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">are so proud of you. Honestly.</font>

06:09.937 --> 06:12.056
How surreal is this?

06:12.057 --> 06:15.497
<font color="#11FF11">It is, it's very surreal. Are you</font>
<font color="#11FF11">real?</font>

06:18.297 --> 06:21.216
<font color="#FFFF00">My journey here has been a bit up</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and down.</font>

06:21.217 --> 06:22.816
<font color="#00FFFF">A wee bit up and down.</font>

06:22.817 --> 06:25.016
<font color="#FFFF00">That's the story of my life, though.</font>

06:25.017 --> 06:28.696
<font color="#11FF11">It's just like watching you in</font>
<font color="#11FF11">normal life.</font>

06:28.697 --> 06:32.256
<font color="#FFFF00">Obviously, I was with Wes for like</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">three weeks.</font>

06:32.257 --> 06:33.776
<font color="#FFFF00">And then I was with Jack for three</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">weeks.</font>

06:33.777 --> 06:37.016
<font color="#FFFF00">And now I've been with Paul for two</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">weeks. It's mad.</font>

06:37.017 --> 06:40.456
<font color="#FFFF00">I just thought I was doing the right</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">thing at the right time.</font>

06:40.457 --> 06:42.976
<font color="#11FF11">Saving the best till last.</font>

06:42.977 --> 06:45.376
<font color="#00FFFF">So how is it going with Laura?</font>

06:45.377 --> 06:51.336
Good. She has definitely made the
experience in here so much better.

06:51.337 --> 06:53.896
Luckily, she kind of split up with
Jack.

06:53.897 --> 06:57.256
It was nice for me to get to know
her and we have clicked.

06:57.257 --> 07:00.496
<font color="#FFFF00">She is lovely.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">We understand each other.</font>

07:00.497 --> 07:02.416
<font color="#00FFFF">She is so cute.</font>

07:02.417 --> 07:05.096
<font color="#FFFF00">Very natural, as well. I think you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">like that, don't you?</font>

07:05.097 --> 07:07.856
If I hadn't met Laura then, really,
there would not have been

07:07.857 --> 07:09.816
anyone else in here for me.

07:09.817 --> 07:12.336
So it would have been a very
different story.

07:12.337 --> 07:13.976
I wouldn't be here sat with both you
now.

07:13.977 --> 07:17.457
<font color="#00FFFF">I am just so, so proud of you.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">It is just amazing.</font>

07:18.577 --> 07:22.056
<font color="#FFFF00">He is a good guy, isn't he?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">He's perfect.</font>

07:22.057 --> 07:25.056
<font color="#FFFF00">I knew that you guys would be like</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that.</font>

07:25.057 --> 07:29.096
<font color="#11FF11">I see a difference, the way you look</font>
<font color="#11FF11">and act with Paul.</font>

07:29.097 --> 07:33.736
<font color="#FFFF00">Because he is my usual type of guy.</font>

07:33.737 --> 07:35.977
<font color="#FFFF00">You know!</font>

07:39.617 --> 07:42.456
<font color="#FFFF00">Why didn't I notice that?</font>

07:42.457 --> 07:44.377
<font color="#00FFFF">Because you are loyal.</font>

07:47.297 --> 07:49.096
<font color="#11FF11">You are loyal, babe.</font>

07:49.097 --> 07:54.456
<font color="#FFFF00">It's a big thing for, especially my</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">sister, to say that she likes a boy</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that I am dating.</font>

07:54.457 --> 07:56.136
Come on, Laura.

07:56.137 --> 07:59.096
<font color="#FFFF00">She doesn't like anyone that I have</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">dated, really.</font>

07:59.097 --> 08:01.136
<font color="#FFFF00">I just can't believe</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that youse are here.</font>

08:01.137 --> 08:02.937
<font color="#FFFF00">It looks weird.</font>

08:04.457 --> 08:06.376
All right, sir. <font color="#11FF11">Cheers.</font>

08:06.377 --> 08:07.736
<font color="#00FFFF">I'll give you a cuddle.</font>

08:07.737 --> 08:09.897
The other side.

08:11.137 --> 08:12.696
<font color="#00FFFF">Did you enjoy the dinner?</font>

08:12.697 --> 08:14.856
<font color="#FFFF00">It was so nice, wasn't it?</font>

08:14.857 --> 08:18.176
<font color="#00FFFF">Beautiful setting. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Oh my God, it was</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">incredible.</font>

08:18.177 --> 08:19.496
<font color="#FFFF00">How romantic for you both.</font>

08:19.497 --> 08:21.616
There you go, wedding venue.

08:21.617 --> 08:23.376
It was the most unbelievable
setting.

08:23.377 --> 08:25.336
<font color="#FFFF00">Calm down!</font>

08:25.337 --> 08:27.816
<font color="#00FFFF">Don't say that to Paul, he will</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">freak out.</font>

08:27.817 --> 08:29.296
I actually meant my sister's
wedding,

08:29.297 --> 08:30.937
because she is getting married.

08:32.177 --> 08:34.616
<font color="#FFFF00">I'll just leave. Sorry.</font>

08:37.017 --> 08:38.576
<font color="#FFFF00">I was getting ahead of myself.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Anyway, it is fine.</font>

08:38.577 --> 08:42.696
There was a bit of confusion when
I said "perfect wedding venue".

08:42.697 --> 08:45.616
It wasn't even awkward, it was
actually comical. It was funny.

08:45.617 --> 08:49.656
<font color="#11FF11">So, as older people, we don't</font>
<font color="#11FF11">understand</font>

08:49.657 --> 08:52.576
<font color="#11FF11">something about life and growing up.</font>

08:52.577 --> 08:53.736
<font color="#FFFF00">You are so annoying.</font>

08:53.737 --> 08:58.016
<font color="#11FF11">When you go with someone and spend</font>
<font color="#11FF11">all your time with them,</font>

08:58.017 --> 09:00.816
<font color="#11FF11">are you not meant to ask them out</font>
<font color="#11FF11">and be boyfriend and girlfriend?</font>

09:00.817 --> 09:02.616
<font color="#11FF11">I don't get this.</font>

09:02.617 --> 09:05.056
<font color="#FFFF00">You do it in stages.</font>

09:05.057 --> 09:08.216
<font color="#11FF11">No. A fella has got to say,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">"Do you want to go for a date?"</font>

09:08.217 --> 09:10.296
<font color="#11FF11">That's boyfriend and girlfriend</font>
<font color="#11FF11">material. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> No!</font>

09:10.297 --> 09:13.776
<font color="#FFFF00">My dad was trying to get bloody Paul</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to ask me to be his girlfriend.</font>

09:13.777 --> 09:15.056
<font color="#FFFF00">I was like, "Dad!"</font>

09:15.057 --> 09:16.896
<font color="#11FF11">Youse have been together for how</font>
<font color="#11FF11">long now?</font>

09:16.897 --> 09:18.056
<font color="#FFFF00">Two weeks.</font>

09:18.057 --> 09:21.656
<font color="#11FF11">You are 24/7, so that equates</font>
<font color="#11FF11">to about a year and a half outside.</font>

09:21.657 --> 09:22.856
<font color="#FFFF00">Why are you, why?</font>

09:22.857 --> 09:25.656
<font color="#11FF11">I'm just asking.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Well, no. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Just curious.</font>

09:25.657 --> 09:28.936
<font color="#FFFF00">I am just sat there like, "Oh my</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">God, please shut up right now."</font>

09:28.937 --> 09:31.136
<font color="#FFFF00">Like, give us a break.</font>

09:31.137 --> 09:33.856
<font color="#FFFF00">We should be taking it steady. It</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">has only been two weeks.</font>

09:33.857 --> 09:36.096
<font color="#00FFFF">You have had everything thrown at</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you, really.</font>

09:36.097 --> 09:38.176
<font color="#00FFFF">But at least you have Paul now.</font>

09:38.177 --> 09:41.256
<font color="#11FF11">Like they say, Laura, you have to</font>
<font color="#11FF11">kiss a few frogs.</font>

09:41.257 --> 09:43.416
<font color="#FFFF00">I am honestly so happy</font>

09:43.417 --> 09:46.456
<font color="#FFFF00">to see my family and it was lovely</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to meet Paul's as well.</font>

09:46.457 --> 09:48.697
<font color="#00FFFF">Well done, everyone. Bye, guys.</font>

09:50.897 --> 09:53.856
There are just so many nice things
they have to say about her.

09:53.857 --> 09:58.216
And they know that, for me to have
met someone in the villa,

09:58.217 --> 09:59.616
she would have been the right one.

09:59.617 --> 10:01.256
Amazing. <font color="#00FFFF">Love you!</font>

10:01.257 --> 10:03.336
<font color="#FFFF00">Love you!</font>

10:03.337 --> 10:05.777
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, my God, so cute.</font>

10:07.977 --> 10:10.736
Still to come, mum's the word.

10:10.737 --> 10:13.856
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, Alex. I'm not sure what show you</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">thought you were coming on to.</font>

10:13.857 --> 10:15.577
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, wow.</font>

10:23.417 --> 10:25.016
It's family day in the villa.

10:25.017 --> 10:28.456
A magical time when dad gets to
eyeball the chancer who has been

10:28.457 --> 10:32.056
cracking on with his daughter on the
telly all summer long.

10:32.057 --> 10:36.296
<font color="#FFFF00">My heart rate is going like the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">clappers.</font>

10:36.297 --> 10:39.416
It is not easy finding the villa.
Luckily Kaz's stepdad got his

10:39.417 --> 10:41.816
orienteering badge when he was in
the Scouts.

10:41.817 --> 10:44.616
So, fingers crossed.

10:44.617 --> 10:46.656
<font color="#FFFF00">Turn right and go through the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">bedroom, is it?</font>

10:46.657 --> 10:48.376
<font color="#00FFFF">It is weird, because usually you</font>

10:48.377 --> 10:52.216
<font color="#00FFFF">would meet your partner's parents by</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">yourself. Not with your parents.</font>

10:52.217 --> 10:56.136
<font color="#00FFFF">Not a lot of my exes' parents</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">met my parents. Did yours?</font>

10:56.137 --> 10:57.897
<font color="#11FF11">No.</font>

10:59.697 --> 11:04.336
<font color="#11FF11">Shut up, shut up, what? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> It is Josh!</font>

11:04.337 --> 11:06.377
(LAUGHTER)

11:18.697 --> 11:21.856
<font color="#FFFF00">It's OK, it's OK.</font>

11:21.857 --> 11:23.496
<font color="#FFFF00">Give Mum a kiss.</font>

11:23.497 --> 11:27.936
<font color="#00FFFF">When I first saw my mum and my</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">stepdad, I could not believe it.</font>

11:27.937 --> 11:30.336
<font color="#00FFFF">I literally started bursting into</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">tears.</font>

11:30.337 --> 11:31.656
<font color="#00FFFF">I miss her so much.</font>

11:31.657 --> 11:34.337
<font color="#11FF11">So, this is where you hang out?</font>

11:37.137 --> 11:38.936
Come down this way.

11:38.937 --> 11:43.176
I did not know what to think, I
thought the sun had gone to my head.

11:43.177 --> 11:46.897
My dad, my sister, I haven't seen
her since November last year.

11:48.017 --> 11:49.896
I teared up. I can't lie.

11:49.897 --> 11:52.376
I was very, very emotional, I had to
hold it back.

11:52.377 --> 11:55.136
No way did I expect to see you, no
way.

11:55.137 --> 11:57.297
<font color="#FFFF00">I had to come and support you.</font>

11:58.817 --> 12:00.416
<font color="#00FFFF">What do you think of Josh?</font>

12:00.417 --> 12:04.496
<font color="#11FF11">What do I think of Josh? (LAUGHS)</font>
<font color="#11FF11">You are happy, aren't you?</font>

12:04.497 --> 12:08.256
<font color="#11FF11">When it started, from the beginning,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I thought, "Oh, my God!"</font>

12:08.257 --> 12:10.976
Heartbroken! (LAUGHTER)

12:10.977 --> 12:18.256
<font color="#11FF11">What I have seen so far, it looks</font>
<font color="#11FF11">like you will take care of you.</font>

12:18.257 --> 12:20.536
He will look after you, I think.

12:20.537 --> 12:23.336
<font color="#FFFF00">You think I am doing all right?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Yes, you are doing really good.</font>

12:23.337 --> 12:24.976
<font color="#11FF11">You have always been a charmer.</font>

12:24.977 --> 12:26.616
<font color="#11FF11">Now you have had the charm dial</font>
<font color="#11FF11">turned right up.</font>

12:26.617 --> 12:28.656
<font color="#11FF11">To 11, I think.</font>

12:28.657 --> 12:33.096
<font color="#11FF11">It was a big moment. We watched that</font>
<font color="#11FF11">and we felt it.</font>

12:33.097 --> 12:35.456
It is so weird to even hear you talk
about it.

12:35.457 --> 12:37.376
<font color="#11FF11">I don't think you really</font>
<font color="#11FF11">had any choice in the end.</font>

12:37.377 --> 12:39.456
No.
<font color="#11FF11">It made itself for you.</font>

12:39.457 --> 12:42.136
Do you like Kaz?
<font color="#FFFF00">I really like her.</font>

12:42.137 --> 12:46.337
<font color="#11FF11">She is really charming and natural.</font>

12:47.617 --> 12:51.256
The only thing you worry about is
whether it is for real.

12:51.257 --> 12:53.616
If you do really feel good.
<font color="#FFFF00">It is.</font>

12:53.617 --> 12:55.176
It is such a short time.

12:55.177 --> 12:57.696
<font color="#FFFF00">Things might feel like they are</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">moving fast, but they are right for</font>

12:57.697 --> 12:59.296
<font color="#FFFF00">that amount of time you're spending.</font>

12:59.297 --> 13:00.856
<font color="#FFFF00">You get to know someone</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">really, really well.</font>

13:00.857 --> 13:05.016
<font color="#00FFFF">Leaving the villa, you know things</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">are going to be different, right?</font>

13:05.017 --> 13:07.216
<font color="#00FFFF">You have to be even stronger.</font>

13:07.217 --> 13:09.936
<font color="#FFFF00">I know, it is scary.</font>

13:09.937 --> 13:11.336
<font color="#FFFF00">It might all change, but I feel</font>

13:11.337 --> 13:16.336
<font color="#FFFF00">he supports me so much that it will</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">have a good impact.</font>

13:16.337 --> 13:19.216
<font color="#00FFFF">You know how I am worried about</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">things.</font>

13:19.217 --> 13:21.136
<font color="#FFFF00">That is why I wanted you to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">be happy.</font>

13:21.137 --> 13:25.536
<font color="#FFFF00">I wanted you to come and see me.</font>

13:25.537 --> 13:30.096
<font color="#FFFF00">I know my mum always worries about</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">me, so of course, it has only been</font>

13:30.097 --> 13:33.136
<font color="#FFFF00">a month, but she is really happy</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">for me.</font>

13:33.137 --> 13:35.256
<font color="#FFFF00">She seems to really like Josh.</font>

13:35.257 --> 13:37.296
<font color="#00FFFF">I have something to say to you.</font>

13:37.297 --> 13:39.377
<font color="#00FFFF">I made that.</font>
(LAUGHTER)

13:41.897 --> 13:46.216
I know, honestly. Kaz's mum is maybe
the cutest thing I have ever seen in

13:46.217 --> 13:48.936
my life. She is so lovely, so nice.

13:48.937 --> 13:52.416
<font color="#FFFF00">He is a very respectful boy. He is a</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">good lad.</font>

13:52.417 --> 13:56.217
<font color="#FFFF00">He is honest and trustworthy.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I would not worry about him.</font>

13:58.857 --> 14:01.576
<font color="#FFFF00">I would not tell him that to his</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">face, obviously.</font>

14:01.577 --> 14:04.176
<font color="#00FFFF">I've never even heard that from you</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">before.</font> (LAUGHTER)

14:04.177 --> 14:05.816
<font color="#00FFFF">It is unbelievable to meet you in</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">person.</font>

14:05.817 --> 14:06.936
<font color="#00FFFF">I thought maybe it would be</font>

14:06.937 --> 14:09.576
<font color="#00FFFF">in south London, but I am glad it</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">has happened here.</font>

14:09.577 --> 14:13.216
<font color="#11FF11">We will do this again.</font> Definitely.

14:13.217 --> 14:17.776
<font color="#00FFFF">It felt natural, we were sitting</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">there, bouncing off each other.</font>

14:17.777 --> 14:19.976
<font color="#00FFFF">I can imagine all of us sitting down</font>

14:19.977 --> 14:25.296
<font color="#00FFFF">to dinner, whether it be a Christmas</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">or at the pub.</font>

14:25.297 --> 14:27.977
<font color="#00FFFF">I am happy for it to happen again</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and I am looking forward to it.</font>

14:31.137 --> 14:33.297
<font color="#00FFFF">See you guys!</font>

14:36.377 --> 14:39.017
Bruv, that was so sick!

14:40.497 --> 14:43.457
That was so lovely! <font color="#FFFF00">That was lovely.</font>

14:44.697 --> 14:47.096
<font color="#00FFFF">Usually, when you meet the parents,</font>

14:47.097 --> 14:50.336
<font color="#00FFFF">it is a huge deal, and you think</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">about it for weeks, you look forward</font>

14:50.337 --> 14:53.896
<font color="#00FFFF">to it, you dread it, you are scared</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">on the way to the house in the car.</font>

14:53.897 --> 14:55.896
<font color="#00FFFF">Here, it is thrown upon you.</font>

14:55.897 --> 14:58.536
<font color="#00FFFF">When our two families met,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">it felt natural.</font>

14:58.537 --> 15:00.817
<font color="#00FFFF">It is a taste of the outside world.</font>

15:06.057 --> 15:12.456
That was a beautiful moment.
<font color="#11FF11">It was so nice.</font>

15:12.457 --> 15:14.297
<font color="#11FF11">I can't stop smiling!</font>

15:19.617 --> 15:24.496
<font color="#FFFF00">Who's next? Who's next?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Someone's coming in.</font>

15:24.497 --> 15:26.816
So whose families are up next? I'll
give you a clue.

15:26.817 --> 15:31.616
This is the first and certainly last
time these people are ever going to
meet.

15:31.617 --> 15:37.177
<font color="#00FFFF">Aaaah! Mum! </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, my God, it's my</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">mum and dad.</font>

15:38.817 --> 15:46.536
<font color="#00FFFF">(SCREAMING) It was the most amazing</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">thing seeing my mum and</font>

15:46.537 --> 15:49.776
<font color="#00FFFF">my cousin today. My first thought</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">was, oh, my God, my mum looked so</font>

15:49.777 --> 15:57.576
<font color="#00FFFF">beautiful. And she has been my rock</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">throughout my whole life. So, oh</font>

15:57.577 --> 16:10.657
<font color="#00FFFF">God, I'm getting emotional. </font><font color="#11FF11"> Alex.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Oh. I've missed you.</font>

16:12.737 --> 16:17.096
<font color="#FFFF00">It was just the most insane moment</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">seeing Mum and Chris walking in.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">He's such a good</font>

16:17.097 --> 16:23.096
<font color="#FFFF00">mate of mine. I was just so happy. I</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">couldn't put into words. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> So you guys</font>

16:23.097 --> 16:28.376
<font color="#00FFFF">are on good terms? </font><font color="#11FF11"> I don't know what</font>
<font color="#11FF11">the last thing you seen. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> This is,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">from</font>

16:28.377 --> 16:30.976
<font color="#FFFF00">our perspective, part of the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">problem. I've been trying to pull</font>

16:30.977 --> 16:35.616
<font color="#FFFF00">myself back from constantly feeling,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I could kill him, he thought he</font>

16:35.617 --> 16:38.456
<font color="#FFFF00">could just drop you and pick you up</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">at a whim. And that's not how life</font>

16:38.457 --> 16:45.456
<font color="#FFFF00">works. But, keep it in perspective.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">And at the end of it all I just put</font>

16:45.457 --> 16:48.056
<font color="#FFFF00">my trust in you. And I tell you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">what, that is where you have</font>

16:48.057 --> 16:52.736
<font color="#FFFF00">surprised me. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Not losing my rag?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Absolutely. Oh honestly. I'm so</font>

16:52.737 --> 16:58.056
<font color="#FFFF00">proud of you. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I thought you were</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">going to come and be like, "Right,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">we need words!"</font>

16:58.057 --> 17:04.056
<font color="#11FF11">You are really burnt. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Am I? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Looking</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">great, mate. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Have you been watching?</font>

17:04.057 --> 17:10.016
<font color="#00FFFF">Absolutely, mate. </font><font color="#11FF11"> Yes. I really like</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Alexandra. She seems like such a</font>

17:10.017 --> 17:15.336
<font color="#11FF11">lovely girl. It was hard to watch</font>
<font color="#11FF11">that conversation. But was it the</font>
<font color="#11FF11">wrong</font>

17:15.337 --> 17:17.576
<font color="#11FF11">thing to do, if you are not feeling</font>
<font color="#11FF11">it, then...</font>

17:17.577 --> 17:22.816
<font color="#11FF11">You were just being honest. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> It is</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">unkind otherwise. </font><font color="#11FF11"> The easy thing to</font>

17:22.817 --> 17:28.776
<font color="#11FF11">do would be to let it run. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> It is not</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">an easy thing to do, having a</font>

17:28.777 --> 17:34.896
<font color="#FFFF00">conversation knowing that they will</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">be upset. It is better for her to be</font>

17:34.897 --> 17:38.696
<font color="#FFFF00">less upset after a difficult</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">conversation. Look, she's better</font>

17:38.697 --> 17:44.337
<font color="#FFFF00">after 24 hours.</font>

17:45.417 --> 17:51.296
Come over, guys. <font color="#FFFF00">We had our</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">fall-out. We've made up and are</font>

17:51.297 --> 17:55.456
<font color="#FFFF00">friends. I don't see why there'd be</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">an issue. I am looking forward to</font>

17:55.457 --> 18:03.856
<font color="#FFFF00">seeing them. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Do we need the dividing</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">wall between us?</font> Yes, Mum! Savage.

18:03.857 --> 18:09.657
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, Alex. I'm not sure what show you</font>
<font color="#11FF11">thought you were coming on to. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Wow,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">here we go!</font>

18:13.817 --> 18:19.376
<font color="#11FF11">When you recoupled, you seemed to</font>
<font color="#11FF11">expect her to be grateful.</font>

18:19.377 --> 18:25.096
<font color="#11FF11">I think you made some comment to</font>
<font color="#11FF11">somebody, why is she so grumpy? What</font>

18:25.097 --> 18:29.496
<font color="#11FF11">did you expect a girl to feel like</font>
<font color="#11FF11">after she had been rejected and then</font>

18:29.497 --> 18:33.496
<font color="#11FF11">you deigned to bring her back to</font>
<font color="#11FF11">your side? I thought, hey young man,</font>

18:33.497 --> 18:39.616
<font color="#11FF11">I will have words with you.</font> The way
we have seen it is you are really

18:39.617 --> 18:42.296
enjoying the time and then all of a
sudden, you back right off and it is

18:42.297 --> 18:52.536
back on. <font color="#00FFFF">For us, watching, it is</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">like, what is going on? </font><font color="#FFFF00"> When I was</font>

18:52.537 --> 18:58.136
<font color="#FFFF00">dating someone, when it gets full</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">on, I get scared and run away. That</font>

18:58.137 --> 19:00.816
<font color="#FFFF00">is a summary of what happens the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">last few years. </font><font color="#11FF11"> Put up a bit of a</font>

19:00.817 --> 19:04.816
<font color="#11FF11">guard maybe. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I have done that</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">classic thing. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> At the end of the</font>

19:04.817 --> 19:10.136
<font color="#00FFFF">day, if you come out as good friends</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and that connection wasn't there</font>

19:10.137 --> 19:14.576
<font color="#00FFFF">previously, is that such a bad</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">thing? </font><font color="#11FF11"> I think they both learned a</font>

19:14.577 --> 19:19.216
<font color="#11FF11">lot about themselves.</font> I did not
think it was possible for Alex to go

19:19.217 --> 19:22.736
any redder. But he did at that point.
I know that she's being a

19:22.737 --> 19:27.336
protective mummy about the Alex
situation, gave him a grilling.

19:27.337 --> 19:32.976
"Oh, God, don't. He's had enough."
<font color="#11FF11">You're not nearly red in the flesh</font>
<font color="#11FF11">as it</font>

19:32.977 --> 19:37.016
<font color="#11FF11">sometimes appears on TV.</font> Mum, don't
tell him that. <font color="#FFFF00">Thank you,</font>

19:37.017 --> 19:44.496
<font color="#FFFF00">I appreciate that. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> They seem to be</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">getting along. </font><font color="#11FF11"> I thought it would be</font>

19:44.497 --> 19:50.256
<font color="#11FF11">awkward. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> It is just amazing to see</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">that you are, it is so lovely to see</font>

19:50.257 --> 19:57.136
<font color="#00FFFF">guys. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I get it, they are her family</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and will be protective of her. That</font>

19:57.137 --> 20:01.336
<font color="#FFFF00">is a nice thing to see. I just</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">wanted to explain my side of things</font>

20:01.337 --> 20:10.376
<font color="#FFFF00">and I hope they understand.</font> I love
you so much. <font color="#11FF11">Good luck for the</font>

20:10.377 --> 20:21.176
<font color="#11FF11">final. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Nice meeting you. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Lovely to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">meet you.</font> To feel the support and

20:21.177 --> 20:24.176
love around this is exactly what you
need. It makes all of the

20:24.177 --> 20:28.657
rollercoasters and the upsets and
happiness so much more worth it.

20:30.857 --> 20:35.416
Coming up, say hello to Danny senior.

20:35.417 --> 20:37.176
<font color="#FFFF00">I'll be nervous to meet you.</font>

20:37.177 --> 20:40.897
<font color="#00FFFF">Look at him, look at his little</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">face.</font>

20:48.857 --> 20:54.176
It's family day and, to mark the
occasion, the producers relaxed the
swimwear-only policy

20:54.177 --> 21:03.416
in the villa., I still think you're
missing a trick. <font color="#FFFF00">I'm really excited.</font>

21:03.417 --> 21:14.376
<font color="#FFFF00">I thought I would be shitting</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">myself. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> It's my dad. Don't even get</font>

21:14.377 --> 21:19.896
<font color="#00FFFF">me! </font><font color="#FFFF00"> It is my brother! Come on!</font>

21:19.897 --> 21:22.897
<font color="#11FF11">Give me a hug!</font>

21:30.817 --> 21:34.456
<font color="#FFFF00">I literally couldn't believe it.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">When I saw my brother and my dad,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I could not stop</font>

21:34.457 --> 21:45.416
<font color="#FFFF00">smiling. It was so surreal.</font> I have
missed my mum and dad so much. I

21:45.417 --> 21:55.656
just want to... on their faces. They
are well cute. <font color="#FFFF00">Your mum and dad OK?</font>

21:55.657 --> 22:03.656
<font color="#00FFFF">They are watching Love Island every</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">night. They love you. They are</font>

22:03.657 --> 22:12.176
<font color="#00FFFF">so proud of you. </font><font color="#11FF11"> Before you come in,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">you were so shy. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I have put all my</font>

22:12.177 --> 22:14.936
<font color="#FFFF00">emotions to the back of my head.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">You have made friends with girls,</font>

22:14.937 --> 22:21.016
<font color="#11FF11">that is a big achievement for you.</font>
How are you? <font color="#FFFF00"> We are good. Every</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">night,</font>

22:21.017 --> 22:23.777
<font color="#FFFF00">in from the garden, watch</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">television.</font> Oh, no.

22:35.617 --> 22:50.416
Just having a DBS meeting. Are you
happy? <font color="#00FFFF">Yes, we are.</font> Do you like
Megan? <font color="#00FFFF">100%. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> You seem so</font>

22:50.417 --> 22:59.896
<font color="#FFFF00">happy. You guys have really good</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">fun.</font> She is really nervous to meet

22:59.897 --> 23:06.816
you. <font color="#00FFFF">She probably is nervous. If you</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">are happy, we are happy.</font> Obviously,

23:06.817 --> 23:10.816
all of the emotions of those eight
weeks, those questions he wanted to

23:10.817 --> 23:14.936
ask, the things you are stressing
about, to know that they are happy

23:14.937 --> 23:17.456
about it all and happy with the
decisions you have made is

23:17.457 --> 23:21.856
incredible. The best moment ever. It
has not been the cleanest of all.

23:21.857 --> 23:29.736
<font color="#FFFF00">But you followed your heart. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Megan</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">suits you. I think you are pretty</font>

23:29.737 --> 23:34.736
<font color="#00FFFF">much very suited.</font> I have so much fun
around her. <font color="#00FFFF">I've not seen you this</font>

23:34.737 --> 23:40.496
<font color="#00FFFF">happy in a long while, mate. </font><font color="#11FF11"> You</font>
<font color="#11FF11">have been through some rough times,</font>

23:40.497 --> 23:46.776
<font color="#11FF11">but everything is fair in love and</font>
<font color="#11FF11">war. You have done it. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> You are going</font>

23:46.777 --> 23:49.616
<font color="#00FFFF">to be stronger than ever with Wes</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">because of the shit you have been</font>

23:49.617 --> 24:00.576
<font color="#00FFFF">through. He is so mature.</font> It is mad,
he is 20. <font color="#11FF11">We've seen you laughing.</font>

24:00.577 --> 24:03.216
<font color="#11FF11">We haven't seen you laughing like</font>
<font color="#11FF11">that in years. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I have never felt</font>

24:03.217 --> 24:11.097
<font color="#FFFF00">this comfortable in front of anyone.</font>

24:16.617 --> 24:18.736
<font color="#FFFF00">Normally I have to try to convince</font>

24:18.737 --> 24:22.216
<font color="#FFFF00">my parents and brother of the guy</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm taking back. But, with</font>

24:22.217 --> 24:29.336
<font color="#FFFF00">Wes, they can really see that he's</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">lovely.</font> I'm talking about going to

24:29.337 --> 24:37.256
Southend with her. <font color="#00FFFF">Southend? </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Are you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">deserting your mother?</font> I am not

24:37.257 --> 24:43.256
deserting you at all! <font color="#FFFF00">You have to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">come back and phone me every week.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't mind</font>

24:43.257 --> 24:47.736
<font color="#FFFF00">at all, if you are happy.</font> I'm sorry
that I'm giving the house. <font color="#FFFF00">I should</font>

24:47.737 --> 24:54.376
<font color="#FFFF00">never have let you leave the house.</font>
If you had known. Mum is such a

24:54.377 --> 25:01.536
worrier. She is happy to see me go on
and do everything. It is so cute.

25:01.537 --> 25:11.696
She is the cutest ever. Nice to meet
you. This is Alf and Polly. Curtis.
<font color="#00FFFF">And</font>

25:11.697 --> 25:21.576
<font color="#00FFFF">Megan. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Nice to meet you finally. I</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">am good.</font> Is everyone OK? Have you

25:21.577 --> 25:24.976
enjoyed watching it? <font color="#00FFFF">I was just</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">saying to Megan that we have never</font>

25:24.977 --> 25:39.256
<font color="#00FFFF">seen her so happy.</font> She was really
worried about meeting you. <font color="#FFFF00">I know.</font>

25:39.257 --> 25:44.656
<font color="#00FFFF">Don't be worried. </font><font color="#11FF11"> No, you've had</font>
<font color="#11FF11">a fun time. You work together well,</font>

25:44.657 --> 25:49.736
<font color="#11FF11">definitely. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I think you are</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">well-suited to go. You're happy,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">she</font>

25:49.737 --> 25:59.576
<font color="#00FFFF">is happy, I am happy. Everyone looks</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">happy.</font> Everyone is happy. <font color="#FFFF00"> Wes's</font>

25:59.577 --> 26:05.256
<font color="#FFFF00">parents are really lovely. I built</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">it up so much in my head.</font>

26:05.257 --> 26:17.257
<font color="#FFFF00">But we all met for the first time</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and we were at ease. We were</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">laughing. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Megan. Wegan. Bye, Wegan!</font>

26:18.777 --> 26:21.256
I've had some seriously special times
with Megan and everybody in

26:21.257 --> 26:26.776
here. That was the most special
moment, not only in here, but in my

26:26.777 --> 26:34.736
life. I was extremely proud to take
Megan to meet my parents. <font color="#00FFFF">Yes.</font>

26:34.737 --> 26:41.736
The lie detector can fuck itself.
<font color="#FFFF00">I do believe that they</font>

26:41.737 --> 26:46.176
<font color="#FFFF00">genuinely like me which meant so</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">much to me. From what I was</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">picturing in</font>

26:46.177 --> 26:49.496
<font color="#FFFF00">my head, it went amazing, it really</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">did.</font>

26:49.497 --> 26:52.776
Families taught some lessons -
love conquers all,

26:52.777 --> 26:57.777
blood is thicker than water,
and never split when you're about
to meet her mum on the telly.

26:59.857 --> 27:07.616
<font color="#FFFF00">I am going to throw up. I can't feel</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">my heart.</font>

27:07.617 --> 27:13.456
<font color="#00FFFF">Yo! </font><font color="#FFFF00"> It is my nan and</font>

27:13.457 --> 27:14.857
<font color="#FFFF00">brother!</font>

27:20.297 --> 27:23.937
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, my God! I miss you!</font>

27:25.737 --> 27:27.417
<font color="#00FFFF">I really miss you.</font>

27:31.177 --> 27:33.176
<font color="#FFFF00">Honestly, when my nan and grandad</font>

27:33.177 --> 27:36.256
<font color="#FFFF00">came in, I called my grandad bruv</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">because, when I was younger, I</font>

27:36.257 --> 27:37.817
<font color="#FFFF00">wanted a brother.</font>

27:46.737 --> 27:52.256
Lovely to meet you. Mate. So
emotional. I could not

27:52.257 --> 27:57.816
believe it, I was so overwhelmed.
I have missed them so much. It was

27:57.817 --> 28:06.336
fucking brilliant. <font color="#00FFFF">We are so proud of</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you. </font><font color="#11FF11"> You are so well suited, a</font>

28:06.337 --> 28:19.416
<font color="#11FF11">match made in heaven.</font> Mum, you will
love her. She doesn't take any shit.

28:19.417 --> 28:23.296
<font color="#FFFF00">Are you enjoying it? Why have you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">lost so much weight?</font>

28:23.297 --> 28:36.296
<font color="#11FF11">Nerves, isn't it? He is lovely. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">knew you would say that. I didn't</font>

28:36.297 --> 28:40.176
<font color="#FFFF00">think I would meet someone like</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Jack. He is just normal. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I hope you</font>

28:40.177 --> 28:49.976
<font color="#00FFFF">last as long as me and Nan. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> How is</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Mummy? Has she been watching it? And</font>

28:49.977 --> 29:01.376
<font color="#FFFF00">Dad? </font><font color="#11FF11"> Yes, he's really proud of you.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">These are our phones. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Excuse me, I</font>

29:01.377 --> 29:10.177
<font color="#00FFFF">got a text!</font> What does it say? <font color="#00FFFF"> I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">don't know yet. It is in Spanish.</font>

29:12.737 --> 29:15.976
<font color="#11FF11">Are you going to move in with him?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">We have lived together every single</font>

29:15.977 --> 29:24.576
<font color="#FFFF00">day for two months. He is lovely to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">me. It might be Daddy in a way.</font>

29:24.577 --> 29:36.217
<font color="#00FFFF">For you, I am very glad. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Don't you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">dare start crying. Look at him.</font>

29:41.897 --> 29:49.256
Honestly, it has been amazing.
<font color="#FFFF00">You're talking about moving in.</font>

29:49.257 --> 29:53.256
I knew you would do this. <font color="#00FFFF">It's all</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">right, there is room for one more,</font>

29:53.257 --> 29:57.057
<font color="#00FFFF">isn't there?</font> You're going to cry!
Yes, you are. I love you. I love you.

30:06.497 --> 30:08.497
<font color="#FFFF00">Jack, come over.</font>

30:12.417 --> 30:20.216
<font color="#FFFF00">Hello, are you all right? You look</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">lovely.</font> It is lovely to meet you.

30:20.217 --> 30:27.536
<font color="#FFFF00">Hello, you all right?</font> I knew,
straightaway, they would love Dani.

30:27.537 --> 30:33.776
<font color="#00FFFF">I think you are very well suited.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">You really are. You look so happy.</font>

30:33.777 --> 30:40.016
<font color="#00FFFF">You are both always smiling. </font><font color="#11FF11"> You</font>
<font color="#11FF11">make each other happy. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> You laugh.</font>

30:40.017 --> 30:42.096
<font color="#00FFFF">Which is important in a</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">relationship.</font>

30:42.097 --> 30:49.696
<font color="#FFFF00">We do bicker. He don't shut</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the fridge, though,</font>

30:49.697 --> 31:02.256
<font color="#FFFF00">does he? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> So you have got your work</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">cut out! </font><font color="#11FF11"> When she first said to you</font>

31:02.257 --> 31:06.976
<font color="#11FF11">that we will just be friends, we</font>
<font color="#11FF11">went, "What is she doing?"</font>

31:06.977 --> 31:15.936
Did you say that? <font color="#11FF11">What is she doing?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">She's mad. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> It is really lovely. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> We</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">have not got</font>

31:15.937 --> 31:22.336
<font color="#FFFF00">long left. Seeing all of our family,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">it was such a proud day. It was</font>

31:22.337 --> 31:32.096
<font color="#FFFF00">perfect. I love you. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Adios amigos.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I am going to bounce on their bed!</font>

31:32.097 --> 31:36.976
While Dani's parents often have more
fun in the bed than Jack ever did,
there

31:36.977 --> 31:44.656
is talk about the day.
<font color="#00FFFF">It's been an amazing day.</font>

31:44.657 --> 31:46.657
<font color="#FFFF00">I have got a text...</font>

31:52.017 --> 31:55.816
OK, cards on the table. I could not
let family day go by

31:55.817 --> 31:59.856
without getting on the dog and bone
and asking Danny senior to come

31:59.857 --> 32:03.057
and speak to his daughter.

32:05.217 --> 32:06.657
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, my God.</font>

32:19.377 --> 32:29.336
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, my God! I miss you. What are you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">doing? Sorry. Mum, you look sexy.</font>

32:29.337 --> 32:35.936
<font color="#00FFFF">I am proper. </font><font color="#11FF11"> We are so proud of you,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">mate. I always told you and</font>

32:35.937 --> 32:41.216
<font color="#11FF11">you never believed me. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> You are proud</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">of me, I have done all right? </font><font color="#11FF11"> You</font>

32:41.217 --> 32:47.736
<font color="#11FF11">are an absolute hero. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Do you like</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Jack? </font><font color="#11FF11"> What it is, I'd like</font>

32:47.737 --> 32:51.657
<font color="#11FF11">to get my hands around his neck and</font>
<font color="#11FF11">choke him until his head pops off!</font>
<font color="#11FF11">No,</font>

32:55.017 --> 32:58.776
<font color="#11FF11">babe, he is lovely. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> He has been so</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">lovely to me. </font><font color="#11FF11"> You have found a</font>

32:58.777 --> 33:07.176
<font color="#11FF11">proper geezer in there. I have not</font>
<font color="#11FF11">been crying every night. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Really? </font><font color="#11FF11"> You</font>

33:07.177 --> 33:09.896
<font color="#11FF11">held your own. Everything that you</font>
<font color="#11FF11">have done. You are so funny and you</font>

33:09.897 --> 33:12.776
<font color="#11FF11">have pulled it out of the bag.</font>

33:12.777 --> 33:15.577
<font color="#FFFF00">I will get Jack, wait there.</font>

33:19.057 --> 33:23.296
<font color="#FFFF00">Jack, my mum and dad are on</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">FaceTime.</font> Shut up!

33:23.297 --> 33:24.936
<font color="#FFFF00">You have to come talk to them.</font>

33:24.937 --> 33:28.777
Where? <font color="#FFFF00">In the living room.</font> Shut up.

33:32.617 --> 33:40.696
<font color="#FFFF00">They are on the telly. </font><font color="#11FF11"> Where is he?</font>

33:40.697 --> 33:43.217
<font color="#11FF11">I am going to kill him. I am going</font>
<font color="#11FF11">to kill the geezer, where is he?</font>

33:45.857 --> 33:49.857
<font color="#11FF11">Here they are. Where is he, I am</font>
<font color="#11FF11">going to kill him?</font> Don't you dare.

33:53.017 --> 33:59.776
<font color="#00FFFF">Jack, sit down.</font> I have been nervous
to meet you. I have been nervous.
<font color="#11FF11">Look</font>

33:59.777 --> 34:07.336
<font color="#11FF11">at his little face. Do you know</font>
<font color="#11FF11">what, Jack? Proper geezer, do you</font>

34:07.337 --> 34:13.496
<font color="#11FF11">know what I love about you? You've</font>
<font color="#11FF11">got a little Derby and charisma.</font>

34:13.496 --> 34:19.416
It is not about abs. <font color="#11FF11">There are many</font>
<font color="#11FF11">guys out there who have</font>

34:19.417 --> 34:31.576
<font color="#11FF11">nothing about them. Honestly, mate,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">we are so over the moon. You have</font>

34:31.577 --> 34:34.335
<font color="#11FF11">looked after each other and it is a</font>
<font color="#11FF11">beautiful thing, do you know what I</font>

34:34.337 --> 34:39.136
<font color="#11FF11">mean? It is rare. You have only</font>
<font color="#11FF11">upset her once, Jack, well done.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Well</font>

34:39.137 --> 34:52.576
<font color="#00FFFF">done.</font> Do you approve of me? <font color="#00FFFF"> Not yet.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Shut up, she is talking bollocks.</font>

34:52.577 --> 35:04.016
<font color="#00FFFF">Are you moving in together? </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Yes.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Yes, let's go. Get up there.</font> Boys

35:04.017 --> 35:14.096
will tell you, I don't get nervous.
The fact that he approves of me and

35:14.097 --> 35:21.016
likes me, that's brilliant. For Dani
as well, she must feel so relieved.

35:21.017 --> 35:25.736
<font color="#11FF11">This is where your life proper</font>
<font color="#11FF11">starts. And also Jack, I'm going to</font>

35:25.737 --> 35:32.816
<font color="#11FF11">get a couple of bits to sign for</font>
<font color="#11FF11">you.</font> I knew you would say that. Sign

35:32.817 --> 35:42.016
my head. <font color="#11FF11">I will sign your nut for</font>
<font color="#11FF11">you. It is going to be a beautiful</font>

35:42.017 --> 35:50.056
<font color="#11FF11">thing. We can't complain. Life is</font>
<font color="#11FF11">fucking beautiful. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I love you so</font>

35:50.057 --> 36:01.976
<font color="#FFFF00">much. </font><font color="#11FF11"> See you on the outside, enjoy</font>
<font color="#11FF11">it.</font> I am so happy for you. <font color="#FFFF00"> Honestly,</font>

36:01.977 --> 36:08.256
<font color="#FFFF00">today has been the most special day.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">It has been two months, we have had</font>

36:08.257 --> 36:13.056
<font color="#FFFF00">no contact with the outside world.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I think we all needed it. That last</font>

36:13.057 --> 36:22.816
<font color="#FFFF00">little push.</font> Mate, that was fucking
quality. <font color="#00FFFF">A bit of banter with him?</font>

36:22.817 --> 36:27.936
I went to him, do you like me? She
said, no, not really. The family was

36:27.937 --> 36:33.896
so fantastic. So lovely. Just like
the people they sent off, sent

36:33.897 --> 36:46.576
packing to come here. It has been so
fucking good. <font color="#00FFFF">Best day ever. Love</font>

36:46.577 --> 36:50.697
<font color="#00FFFF">Island 2018.</font>
(WHOOPING)

36:53.697 --> 36:56.976
Coming up, the islanders get some
flak.

36:56.977 --> 37:00.857
<font color="#FFFF00">Hi, guys. Long time, no see.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I smell trouble.</font>

37:09.897 --> 37:12.216
It has been a day of surprises
in the villa.

37:12.217 --> 37:14.376
And the biggest surprise of all is
that it has taken

37:14.377 --> 37:19.056
56 shows for someone to finally use
that bloody Jacuzzi.

37:19.057 --> 37:20.656
<font color="#FFFF00">I am going to trump.</font>

37:20.657 --> 37:23.417
<font color="#11FF11">No. Ahhh... The worst thing is,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">the bubble comes out.</font>

37:26.017 --> 37:30.416
<font color="#FFFF00">I am so happy how nice Paul's mum</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">is.</font>

37:30.417 --> 37:32.896
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, God, they are so nice.</font>

37:32.897 --> 37:35.257
<font color="#FFFF00">What a day. What a day.</font>

37:48.777 --> 37:50.696
<font color="#FFFF00">That moon is really sick.</font>

37:50.697 --> 37:54.257
<font color="#11FF11">It is going to be a full moon,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">right, when that comes off.</font>

37:56.457 --> 37:58.936
<font color="#FFFF00">It is beautiful, isn't it?</font>

37:58.937 --> 38:02.016
<font color="#11FF11">Crazy stuff always happens on a full</font>
<font color="#11FF11">moon.</font>

38:02.017 --> 38:05.217
Well, wait till you see what happens
under a blood moon.

38:06.897 --> 38:09.497
Say hello to the Flack.

38:15.977 --> 38:17.696
Last night, the couples each
nominated

38:17.697 --> 38:19.536
another couple to be dumped.

38:19.537 --> 38:22.176
And it is time to find out who is
going.

38:22.177 --> 38:24.696
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, guys.</font> Oh, sh...

38:24.697 --> 38:27.336
Hi, guys. <font color="#FFFF00">Oh, hell.</font>

38:27.337 --> 38:29.576
Long time no see. <font color="#FFFF00">Yeah.</font>

38:29.577 --> 38:31.456
Come and join me by the fire pit.

38:31.457 --> 38:33.057
<font color="#FFFF00">I smell trouble. I smell trouble.</font>

38:34.097 --> 38:36.176
<font color="#11FF11">I knew something crazy would happen.</font>

38:36.177 --> 38:37.897
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, it's a full moon.</font>

38:40.977 --> 38:46.057
<font color="#11FF11"># I've got trouble on my mind...</font>

38:51.497 --> 38:53.936
Islanders, as you know,

38:53.937 --> 38:55.456
you have all secretly voted for

38:55.457 --> 38:58.457
which couple you think should be
dumped from the island.

39:03.377 --> 39:05.697
Your votes have put three couples at
risk.

39:13.857 --> 39:17.296
Which means two couples are
definitely safe and through

39:17.297 --> 39:19.297
to the Love Island final.

39:23.657 --> 39:25.537
Can you all please stand up?

39:32.497 --> 39:35.016
The first couple safe

39:35.017 --> 39:38.897
and through to the final is...

39:53.737 --> 39:55.656
Megan and Wes.

39:55.657 --> 39:57.896
Congratulations, guys.

39:57.897 --> 39:59.537
Take a seat.

40:02.377 --> 40:04.457
<font color="#11FF11">Well done, guys. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Well done.</font>

40:07.137 --> 40:10.257
<font color="#FFFF00">Jeez. Thanks, guys. Seriously.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Thank you.</font>

40:13.217 --> 40:16.296
The second couple safe

40:16.297 --> 40:18.257
and in the final is...

40:25.577 --> 40:26.896
Dani and Jack.

40:26.897 --> 40:28.777
(APPLAUSE)

40:30.177 --> 40:32.657
Congratulations, guys. Well done.

40:45.537 --> 40:47.297
<font color="#11FF11">Fucking hell.</font>

40:51.457 --> 40:54.096
That means Kaz and Josh,

40:54.097 --> 40:56.416
Laura and Paul,

40:56.417 --> 40:59.616
Alexandra and Alex,

40:59.617 --> 41:01.296
following the Islander vote,

41:01.297 --> 41:04.497
you are all at risk of being dumped
tonight.

41:11.537 --> 41:16.177
However, only one couple will be
going home.

41:19.057 --> 41:22.977
The public have been voting for
the couple they want to save.

41:26.137 --> 41:29.856
The two couples with the most votes
will join Megan and Wes

41:29.857 --> 41:31.616
and Dani and Jack

41:31.617 --> 41:33.457
in the final.

41:36.297 --> 41:40.376
The couple with the fewest votes

41:40.377 --> 41:43.417
will be dumped tonight.

41:50.617 --> 41:57.177
In no particular order, the first
couple saved by the public is...

42:13.457 --> 42:16.777
Laura and Paul.
(APPLAUSE)

42:20.737 --> 42:21.936
Well done, guys.

42:21.937 --> 42:23.416
<font color="#FFFF00">Well done. </font><font color="#11FF11"> Well done.</font>

42:23.417 --> 42:25.977
<font color="#FFFF00">Mate, well done.</font>

42:48.937 --> 42:50.296
Kaz and Josh,

42:50.297 --> 42:51.856
Alexandra and Alex,

42:51.857 --> 42:56.616
only one more couple can go through
to the final.

42:56.617 --> 42:59.737
The other couple will leave the
he island immediately.

43:06.937 --> 43:12.696
The final couple saved by the public
and taking their place in the final

43:12.697 --> 43:14.297
is...

43:31.137 --> 43:33.776
Kaz and Josh.
(APPLAUSE)

43:33.777 --> 43:35.936
Well done, guys.

43:35.937 --> 43:39.016
Alexandra and Alex, unfortunately
that means you have been dumped

43:39.017 --> 43:41.736
and your time on the island has come
to an end.

43:41.737 --> 43:43.416
You can now say your goodbyes.

43:43.417 --> 43:45.176
Congratulations, everyone else, for
making the final.

43:45.177 --> 43:47.177
I'll see you soon.

43:48.377 --> 43:50.376
<font color="#FFFF00">You did so well, babes.</font>

43:50.377 --> 43:52.456
<font color="#11FF11">Thank you so much. I will miss all</font>
<font color="#11FF11">you guys.</font>

43:52.457 --> 43:54.776
<font color="#FFFF00">We love you so much.</font>

43:54.777 --> 43:57.576
<font color="#FFFF00">I just cannot even put it into</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">words.</font>

43:57.577 --> 43:58.976
<font color="#FFFF00">I can't believe it.</font>

43:58.977 --> 44:01.697
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm in the final. I did not prepare</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">for this.</font>

44:03.017 --> 44:05.296
<font color="#11FF11">It's been so good getting to know</font>
<font color="#11FF11">you properly.</font>

44:05.297 --> 44:06.696
<font color="#11FF11">Good luck.</font>

44:06.697 --> 44:08.856
<font color="#FFFF00">You have a sick time. I am proud of</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you all.</font>

44:08.857 --> 44:11.536
<font color="#11FF11">I have made the final. It is epic,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">it is unbelievable.</font>

44:11.537 --> 44:13.496
<font color="#11FF11">But to see Alex and Alexandra go</font>
<font color="#11FF11">home,</font>

44:13.497 --> 44:15.976
<font color="#11FF11">it is a hugely sad situation.</font>

44:15.977 --> 44:19.096
<font color="#FFFF00">Even a couple of days without you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">is going to be weird.</font>

44:19.097 --> 44:21.656
<font color="#11FF11">I know.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I love you, mate.</font>

44:21.657 --> 44:23.936
<font color="#FFFF00">Alex is my best mate. I promise you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">now</font>

44:23.937 --> 44:26.136
<font color="#FFFF00">we are going to be friends for life.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I love him so much.</font>

44:26.137 --> 44:27.736
<font color="#FFFF00">I cannot even explain to you.</font>

44:27.737 --> 44:30.617
<font color="#FFFF00">I am going to miss him. I am going</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to really miss him.</font>

44:32.657 --> 44:35.336
<font color="#11FF11">There is a bitter-sweetness about</font>
<font color="#11FF11">this whole thing.</font>

44:35.337 --> 44:37.937
<font color="#FFFF00">It's like you are buzzing and you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">are not happy.</font>

44:39.817 --> 44:41.817
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh...</font>

44:44.537 --> 44:47.176
<font color="#FFFF00">It's the right thing, and all you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">other four couples</font>

44:47.177 --> 44:49.176
<font color="#FFFF00">are in relationships.</font>

44:49.177 --> 44:52.096
<font color="#FFFF00">You know, I had my chance and</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">unfortunately it did not work out.</font>

44:52.097 --> 44:54.896
<font color="#FFFF00">At the end of the day, I have made</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">friends for life.</font>

44:54.897 --> 44:56.176
<font color="#FFFF00">I am proud of you all.</font>

44:56.177 --> 44:58.496
<font color="#11FF11">I've been with Alex every day for</font>
<font color="#11FF11">two months.</font>

44:58.497 --> 45:03.336
<font color="#11FF11">He is just such a stand-up, genuine,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">intelligent man.</font>

45:03.337 --> 45:05.616
<font color="#11FF11">I cannot imagine life without him.</font>

45:05.617 --> 45:08.256
<font color="#FFFF00">I have not found love in here, and</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that is what this island is about.</font>

45:08.257 --> 45:10.336
<font color="#11FF11">You will. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I might do on the outside.</font>

45:10.337 --> 45:11.936
<font color="#11FF11">There is never a might, there is a</font>
<font color="#11FF11">will.</font>

45:11.937 --> 45:14.376
<font color="#11FF11">She is one of those girls who will</font>
<font color="#11FF11">always be a part of my life.</font>

45:14.377 --> 45:16.936
<font color="#11FF11">Although she did not find love in</font>
<font color="#11FF11">here, she met friends in here,</font>

45:16.937 --> 45:19.577
<font color="#11FF11">and we will all help her as friends</font>
<font color="#11FF11">to find love on the outside.</font>

45:21.537 --> 45:23.736
<font color="#FFFF00">If anyone has got any mates, let me</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">know.</font>

45:23.737 --> 45:25.576
<font color="#11FF11">Well, Alex has got his mate.</font>

45:25.577 --> 45:27.657
<font color="#FFFF00">Yes, a bit too close to home.</font>
(LAUGHTER)

45:33.977 --> 45:36.736
<font color="#FFFF00">I literally cannot wait to see you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">when we get out of here.</font>

45:36.737 --> 45:39.416
<font color="#11FF11">I love you guys.</font>

45:39.417 --> 45:42.096
<font color="#FFFF00">I absolutely adore Dr Alex.</font>

45:42.097 --> 45:43.896
<font color="#FFFF00">It has been an absolute pleasure</font>

45:43.897 --> 45:45.456
<font color="#FFFF00">to be in the villa with the boy.</font>

45:45.457 --> 45:48.016
<font color="#11FF11">I love you. You are like a brother,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">man.</font>

45:48.017 --> 45:49.856
<font color="#FFFF00">Enjoy it. You all deserve it.</font>

45:49.857 --> 45:51.216
<font color="#FFFF00">Each and every one of you deserve</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">this.</font>

45:51.217 --> 45:52.696
<font color="#FFFF00">You have all had amazing journeys.</font>

45:52.697 --> 45:55.256
<font color="#11FF11">Thank you, Alex. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I am proud of all</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">of you, I really am.</font>

45:55.257 --> 45:58.177
<font color="#11FF11">Bye, guys. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> See you soon. Love you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">all so much.</font>

45:59.177 --> 46:02.256
<font color="#FFFF00">Bye, guys!</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Bye!</font>

46:02.257 --> 46:04.417
(CHEERING)

46:16.217 --> 46:18.256
<font color="#FFFF00">I am sad, of course I'm sad to leave</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the villa.</font>

46:18.257 --> 46:22.056
<font color="#FFFF00">But I have loved most of it.</font>

46:22.057 --> 46:27.337
<font color="#FFFF00">Maybe a bit less sunburn.</font>

46:31.497 --> 46:33.696
<font color="#00FFFF">Bye, guys. Good luck. Love you.</font>

46:33.697 --> 46:41.456
<font color="#FFFF00">Yes, I did not find love as I had</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">hoped. But we get on very well. I</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">think that is great.</font>

46:41.457 --> 46:45.096
<font color="#FFFF00">We did it. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> We have been through our</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">little rollercoaster</font>

46:45.097 --> 46:49.736
<font color="#00FFFF">together. But we are friends, the</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">other couples are very solid and</font>

46:49.737 --> 46:55.016
<font color="#00FFFF">deserve to be there. </font><font color="#11FF11"> Congratulations</font>
<font color="#11FF11">to all of us for making it to the</font>

46:55.017 --> 47:04.896
<font color="#11FF11">final. And to Alex and Alexandra.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Cheers. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> We have done it! </font><font color="#11FF11"> I have</font>
<font color="#11FF11">never</font>

47:04.897 --> 47:07.936
