WEBVTT

00:06.868 --> 00:08.830
- Huh?
- Oh, uh, it's a pet name.

00:08.924 --> 00:11.093
- I don't have actual honey.
- [sighs]

00:11.176 --> 00:12.802
- [laughter]
- Diane!

00:12.886 --> 00:16.056
Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter. Mwah.

00:16.139 --> 00:17.766
BoJack Horseman!

00:17.849 --> 00:19.601
- Put her there!
- That's all right.

00:19.684 --> 00:21.228
I'm gonna get that handshake.

00:21.311 --> 00:22.520
No, you're not.

00:22.604 --> 00:23.855
[laughs] Since when am I Honey?

00:23.939 --> 00:25.441
Since now.

00:25.523 --> 00:27.525
I made up the nickname
while you were back east.

00:27.609 --> 00:29.903
Yeah, really? You made
up calling someone honey?

00:29.986 --> 00:31.529
Uh, I do believe so. Yes.

00:31.613 --> 00:33.282
Hey, why don't we give BoJack a ride?

00:33.365 --> 00:34.657
That's okay. Todd's supposed to pick me up.

00:34.741 --> 00:36.076
Where is he?

00:36.159 --> 00:37.827
- [indistinct chatter]
- [cell door buzzing]

00:37.911 --> 00:40.163
First day, huh? [Laughs]

00:40.247 --> 00:42.249
Well, stick with me.
You're gonna be just fi...

00:42.332 --> 00:45.001
- [grunts]
- [gasps]

00:45.085 --> 00:46.295
[gasping]

00:46.378 --> 00:48.171
Probably just forgot, the lazy bum.

00:48.255 --> 00:50.299
Hey, I'll take the ride as
long as it's not as bumpy

00:50.382 --> 00:51.841
as that pilot's landing.

00:51.925 --> 00:53.510
That was seriously very scary.

00:53.593 --> 00:55.553
- Hey...
- I'm just glad you were there,

00:55.637 --> 00:57.555
because I really would
have freaked out by myself.

00:57.639 --> 00:59.682
Be stiller, my beating heart.

00:59.766 --> 01:01.435
Stiller crazy after all these years.

01:01.518 --> 01:03.019
- [laughter]
- Did I miss something funny?

01:03.103 --> 01:05.230
- I love funny somethings.
- No, we were just laughing

01:05.313 --> 01:07.690
about this Ben Stiller
article from the plane.

01:07.774 --> 01:09.109
- [laughter]
- Ooh, he is the best.

01:09.192 --> 01:11.153
- What did it say?
- You wouldn't get it.

01:11.236 --> 01:13.696
Either you read Hemisphere's
Magazine, or you don't.

01:13.780 --> 01:16.533
Hey, I might be crazy, because
this is such a dumb question,

01:16.616 --> 01:18.910
and I'm embarrassed to even ask,

01:18.994 --> 01:23.457
but do I have anything to
worry about with you and Diane?

01:23.540 --> 01:25.292
What?

01:25.375 --> 01:28.128
[laughs] What?

01:28.211 --> 01:29.754
Get out of here.

01:29.838 --> 01:32.048
I got to say, BoJack,

01:32.132 --> 01:33.633
that is a relief.

01:33.716 --> 01:36.970
Ho-ho! Whoo!

[panting]

02:31.774 --> 02:33.667
Hey, do you guys want to grab dinner?

02:33.667 --> 02:34.961
Or at least some road sodas,

02:35.044 --> 02:36.754
so I don't have to go through the ordeal

02:36.837 --> 02:38.464
of sobering up and then having
to get drunk all over again?

02:38.547 --> 02:40.758
Oh, I actually already made special plans

02:40.841 --> 02:42.093
for just the two of us.

02:42.176 --> 02:43.510
Oh, come on.

02:43.594 --> 02:45.012
You're the one who's always saying

02:45.096 --> 02:46.889
you want to hang out with BoJack more,

02:46.973 --> 02:48.474
and how it's weird that BoJack
never returns your calls,

02:48.557 --> 02:50.310
and how I should hang up the phone

02:50.392 --> 02:52.019
because maybe BoJack's
trying to call you right now.

02:52.103 --> 02:53.687
Uh, okay.

02:53.771 --> 02:56.732
I guess we can make this work.

02:56.816 --> 02:58.609
- [laughter]
- Oh.

02:58.692 --> 03:01.028
Oh, man. Remember that guy in 34-B?

03:01.112 --> 03:03.823
Do I? Can't stop remembering him.

03:03.906 --> 03:05.783
Uh, hey. Diane and I have memories, too.

03:05.866 --> 03:08.535
This place reminds me of
a cliff side meal we had

03:08.619 --> 03:11.122
one romantic vacay to Cabo.

03:11.205 --> 03:12.498
Boring. I wasn't there.

03:12.581 --> 03:14.917
Can we keep this general interests?

03:15.001 --> 03:18.045
Well, here's to a meal we're all here for.

03:18.129 --> 03:19.421
Mmm.

03:19.505 --> 03:20.965
Oh, oh. Ew.

03:21.048 --> 03:22.216
There's something in my food.

03:22.300 --> 03:23.425
Ah, crap. Someone get the manager.

03:23.509 --> 03:25.178
No, no, no. Wait.

03:25.261 --> 03:28.014
It's supposed to be in
there. Welcome home, honey.

03:28.097 --> 03:32.601
I got you a D pendant,
because I am D-pendant on you.

03:32.685 --> 03:34.561
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Real... Real cute.

03:34.645 --> 03:37.231
- A D for dog.
- It's for Diane.

03:37.315 --> 03:40.901
This is the sweetest choking
hazard anyone's ever given me.

03:40.985 --> 03:42.903
- [moans]
- Mwah.

03:42.987 --> 03:44.989
Well, how about some
champagne for the happy couple.

03:45.072 --> 03:46.907
Waiter, get me a bottle of Dom

03:46.991 --> 03:49.451
to keep with the trend of sweet D gifts.

03:49.535 --> 03:51.120
You're too kind,

03:51.204 --> 03:54.290
but everyone knows you go
off menu for the good stuff.

03:54.374 --> 03:56.959
Yes, get me your most
expensive bottle from the back.

03:57.043 --> 04:00.629
Perhaps a 1922-ISH Heidsieck Diamant Bleu?

04:00.713 --> 04:03.924
A toast on me to Diane
and Mr. Peanutbutter.

04:04.008 --> 04:05.926
I'd like a round of drinks for everyone.

04:06.010 --> 04:07.428
Off the menu, of course.

04:07.511 --> 04:10.597
- [all cheering]
- BoJack, folks. What a sport.

04:10.681 --> 04:12.641
And while we're all in giving moods,

04:12.725 --> 04:16.269
I'd like to buy you all
an Xbox, courtesy of me.

04:16.353 --> 04:17.603
[all cheering]

04:17.688 --> 04:19.732
Wow. You guys don't have to do this.

04:19.815 --> 04:22.026
Look, I could happily
go down this petty road

04:22.108 --> 04:23.277
of raising and re-raising one another.

04:23.361 --> 04:24.820
Man: Please do!

04:24.904 --> 04:26.488
But I'd instead like to highlight the fact

04:26.572 --> 04:28.324
that Mr. Peanutbutter's
ripping off my toast

04:28.408 --> 04:31.411
the same way he ripped
off my entire career.

04:31.493 --> 04:34.247
Man 2: Uh, we prefer
gifts over observations.

04:34.330 --> 04:36.957
Okay. Well, here's
something I didn't rip off.

04:37.041 --> 04:39.126
This brand new helicopter I just bought.

04:39.210 --> 04:41.628
Whoo-whoo! Who wants
a ride in the chopper?

04:41.712 --> 04:43.923
- [applause and cheering]
- Okay, guys. This has been fun,

04:44.006 --> 04:46.592
and also an offensive
display of extravagant wealth,

04:46.675 --> 04:48.052
but maybe we should call it a night.

04:48.135 --> 04:49.345
What's the rush?

04:49.429 --> 04:50.554
Because I just bought the restaurant,

04:50.637 --> 04:52.181
and we can stay as long as we want.

04:52.265 --> 04:53.515
- [all cheering]
- Hey, you. I own you now.

04:53.599 --> 04:56.436
- Do a dance.
- [scats]

04:59.688 --> 05:01.357
Oops.

05:01.441 --> 05:02.900
[laughs] Oh, no. Hey, sorry, bud.

05:02.983 --> 05:05.069
- It's all yours.
- Please, you first.

05:05.152 --> 05:07.529
Apparently, we both like to be clean.

05:07.613 --> 05:10.699
I love being clean. That's so coincidental.

05:10.783 --> 05:12.410
- I'm Todd.
- Klaus.

05:12.493 --> 05:14.328
Look, I know you're new here,

05:14.412 --> 05:18.958
but we have a lot in common:
being white, into cleansing.

05:19.041 --> 05:21.543
I think you'd enjoy hanging
out with me and the gang.

05:21.627 --> 05:24.922
When you say "the gang,"
do you mean a gang?

05:25.005 --> 05:26.466
Check this out. If you
want to lift weights,

05:26.548 --> 05:28.384
we got great yard connections.

05:28.468 --> 05:30.677
If you like toilet wine,
we spent the past 20 years

05:30.761 --> 05:32.263
perfecting pruno.

05:32.346 --> 05:35.015
The Aryan nation is
number one for a reason.

05:35.099 --> 05:36.476
Never thought I'd say this,

05:36.558 --> 05:38.769
but you put a pretty good spin on Nazis.

05:38.852 --> 05:40.562
Hey, tell you what. Drop
by our party tomorrow.

05:40.646 --> 05:42.815
Shoot the shit with the
guys, mostly about Jews,

05:42.898 --> 05:44.608
and make up your own mind.

05:44.691 --> 05:46.319
Until then, take my card.

05:46.402 --> 05:49.822
Whoa. Uh, where were you keeping that card?

05:49.905 --> 05:52.783
Both: Forty-five, forty-six,

05:52.866 --> 05:54.910
forty-seven...

05:54.994 --> 05:57.579
Guys, can we give this thing a rest?

05:57.663 --> 05:59.290
Rest? Why rest? I'm not tired.

05:59.373 --> 06:00.960
I'm twice as not tired.

06:01.291 --> 06:04.485
_

06:07.507 --> 06:11.260
Or D, sex and candy?

06:11.344 --> 06:13.053
[vibrates and rings]

06:13.137 --> 06:14.472
Todd: BoJack!

06:14.555 --> 06:16.265
Todd, where the hell have you been?

06:16.349 --> 06:17.933
I had to carpool home from the airport

06:18.017 --> 06:19.810
like a goddamn environmentalist.

06:19.893 --> 06:21.979
I'm sorry, but I'm in jail, dude.

06:22.062 --> 06:24.357
Well, you called the right
person, because I need your help

06:24.440 --> 06:25.941
and you're my phone-a-friend.

06:26.025 --> 06:28.944
Marie Curie won Nobel
prizes in which two sciences?

06:29.028 --> 06:30.530
A, chemistry and physics.

06:30.612 --> 06:33.574
- B, biology and physics...
- Oh, B! The answer's B!

06:33.657 --> 06:34.992
- It's A!
- Damn it, Todd!

06:35.075 --> 06:36.536
This was life or death.

06:36.618 --> 06:38.662
Same with me. The bail's set at 50 bucks.

06:38.745 --> 06:40.747
I'll be here wai...

06:42.124 --> 06:44.126
[groaning]

06:45.711 --> 06:48.881
Yes! I am the champion of the games!

06:48.964 --> 06:51.008
Did you see that, Diane?

06:51.091 --> 06:52.468
Diane?

06:52.552 --> 06:53.719
You win, old friend.

06:53.802 --> 06:55.221
Now if you'll excuse me,

06:55.304 --> 06:57.806
I'm going to take my girlfriend to bed.

06:57.890 --> 06:59.392
[groans]

06:59.475 --> 07:00.893
We're still out?

07:00.976 --> 07:02.520
[groans]

07:02.603 --> 07:03.854
Night, BoJack.

07:03.937 --> 07:06.273
Good night, Diane.

07:06.357 --> 07:09.402
Give me a bottle of something
to help me forget my problems.

07:09.485 --> 07:11.237
Ooh, maybe not that strong.

07:11.320 --> 07:12.988
What is this, breakfast?

07:13.072 --> 07:14.656
Yeah, that's about right.

07:14.740 --> 07:17.076
[gulping]

07:21.747 --> 07:23.874
Well, that worked effectively.

07:23.957 --> 07:26.043
Newsman: It's a Holly-who-done-it

07:26.126 --> 07:27.628
as police are scrambling to figure out

07:27.711 --> 07:30.464
who stole the D from
the famed Hollywood sign.

07:30.548 --> 07:32.841
- Holly-what?
- All of Tinseltown's

07:32.925 --> 07:35.886
at DEFCON 5 until their
diabolically displaced D

07:35.969 --> 07:38.347
is demonstrably displayed once more.

07:38.431 --> 07:40.015
Can we cool it with the alliteration?

07:40.099 --> 07:42.768
Who wrote this copy? Randy, looking at you.

07:42.851 --> 07:44.437
Weird.

07:44.520 --> 07:45.687
Weirder.

07:45.771 --> 07:47.231
[doorbell rings]

07:47.314 --> 07:49.149
Why the hell would I steal a giant D?

07:49.233 --> 07:51.110
Ding-dong! It's Diane.

07:51.193 --> 07:53.737
D... D... Damn!

07:53.820 --> 07:55.239
Meanwhile, local authorities

07:55.322 --> 07:56.949
are already investigating several suspects.

07:57.032 --> 07:59.493
David Duchovny, Dick Van Dyke, DMX,

07:59.577 --> 08:02.413
and of course Dane Cook,
who we all know is a thief.

08:02.496 --> 08:05.707
Hey, D-voted memoirist.

08:05.791 --> 08:08.377
I can't work on the book
today. Too ill. Cough.

08:08.461 --> 08:10.337
Are you ill, or hung-over?

08:10.421 --> 08:12.839
Because instead of coughing
you just said the word cough.

08:12.923 --> 08:14.467
Plus you left me a long,
drunken voice-mail last night.

08:14.550 --> 08:15.759
Ooh, was it bad?

08:15.842 --> 08:17.052
It was mostly a lot of wheezing,

08:17.136 --> 08:18.596
as if you were climbing something,

08:18.679 --> 08:20.222
followed by the sounds
of dismantling metal,

08:20.306 --> 08:21.723
and then grunting like you
were dragging something heavy

08:21.807 --> 08:23.225
at least a few miles.

08:23.309 --> 08:25.227
I didn't say anything incriminating, did I?

08:25.311 --> 08:27.146
As incriminating as that question? No.

08:27.229 --> 08:28.689
Good. Well, just as a general rule,

08:28.772 --> 08:29.898
you probably shouldn't be listening

08:29.982 --> 08:31.609
to any voicemails I leave after...

08:31.692 --> 08:33.277
- What time do I start drinking?
- Noon?

08:33.360 --> 08:35.404
- Yup. See you later.
- But we had an appointment.

08:35.488 --> 08:37.530
What's that? An actor
flaking on an obligation?

08:37.615 --> 08:39.616
- Welcome to Hollywood.
- I think you mean Hollywoo.

08:39.700 --> 08:41.743
Did you see? Someone
stole the D off the sign.

08:41.827 --> 08:43.078
Cough, cough, cough, cough, cough.

08:43.162 --> 08:45.498
Cough, cough, cough, cough, door slam.

08:45.581 --> 08:47.458
- [phone rings]
- What is it, BoJack?

08:47.541 --> 08:49.835
You know, I'm tied up
with all my Deans today.

08:49.918 --> 08:51.795
Kane, Norris, Winters, and Koontz,

08:51.878 --> 08:53.631
all being questioned by police.

08:53.714 --> 08:55.257
It was me. I stole the D.

08:55.341 --> 08:56.925
- What?
- Now be a good agent

08:57.009 --> 08:58.177
and make this not my problem.

08:58.260 --> 08:59.970
How did you even...?

09:00.053 --> 09:02.222
You know, your scandal-to-work
ratio is, like, five to one.

09:02.306 --> 09:04.224
Look, I need to get rid of
this before Diane sees it.

09:04.308 --> 09:06.686
Why do you care if Dia... Oh, fish.

09:06.768 --> 09:08.937
Are you in love with your biographer?

09:09.021 --> 09:11.064
What?

09:11.148 --> 09:13.567
<i>[laughs] What?</i>

09:13.651 --> 09:15.611
Get out of here.

09:15.695 --> 09:18.780
You stole the D for Diane. Unbelievable.

09:18.864 --> 09:20.407
Yeah, I don't know. The
D might be for David,

09:20.491 --> 09:22.075
because apparently when I was drunk,

09:22.159 --> 09:24.578
I printed out a bunch of
pictures of David Boreanaz.

09:24.662 --> 09:27.206
Yeah. You did that.

09:27.289 --> 09:28.999
Look, I'll keep your little
crush busy long enough

09:29.082 --> 09:30.501
for you to get rid of the contraband,

09:30.584 --> 09:31.793
but the next three weddings I'm invited to,

09:31.877 --> 09:33.462
you're my date, dummy.

09:33.546 --> 09:36.089
Since when to women your
age get invited to weddings?

09:36.173 --> 09:37.383
I have a lot of nieces and nephews!

09:37.466 --> 09:38.676
[phone beeps off]

09:38.759 --> 09:40.093
- [claps]
- Well, you pulled it off,

09:40.177 --> 09:41.679
you deviant.

09:41.762 --> 09:44.390
Get it? D-viant?

09:44.473 --> 09:45.932
- I got it.
- Tell me,

09:46.016 --> 09:47.851
how are you gonna complete
your giant bracelet?

09:47.934 --> 09:49.520
With the chain-link fence
from Dodger's Stadium?

09:49.603 --> 09:52.356
No. How'd you figure out it was me?

09:52.439 --> 09:55.067
Oh, how did I figure it out?
Well, I just followed the clues,

09:55.150 --> 09:58.028
used deduction, puzzle-solving,
a little bit of forensics,

09:58.111 --> 09:59.780
and also, what did I do?

09:59.863 --> 10:02.074
Oh, I listened to the voice-mail you left me

10:02.157 --> 10:04.618
saying you were stealing
the D because of Diane

10:04.702 --> 10:08.080
so I could, and I quote, "Suck your D."

10:08.163 --> 10:10.040
Stop leaving voicemails!

10:10.123 --> 10:12.292
Admit it! You like my girlfriend.

10:12.376 --> 10:15.337
Oh, come on. I mean, am
I attracted to her? Sure.

10:15.421 --> 10:17.548
Do my days feel better
when I'm around her? Yeah.

10:17.631 --> 10:20.384
Does she get me in ways no
woman ever has? Indubitably.

10:20.467 --> 10:23.011
Do I fantasize about her?
Yes, but only in two positions.

10:23.095 --> 10:24.930
Look, am I the kind of
guy who would try to steal

10:25.013 --> 10:26.223
someone else's girlfriend?

10:26.306 --> 10:27.808
Sure, of course, but do I like her?

10:27.891 --> 10:30.227
The answer's no. You have
nothing to worry about.

10:30.310 --> 10:31.812
I'll cut you a deal.

10:31.895 --> 10:33.647
I help you get rid of that D,

10:33.731 --> 10:36.650
and you never talk to Diane again.

10:36.734 --> 10:39.486
Well, I have to talk to her,
because she's writing my book.

10:39.570 --> 10:42.573
Okay, but just don't
pursue her romantically?

10:42.656 --> 10:44.366
- Deal.
- Ha!

10:44.450 --> 10:47.453
- I knew I'd get that handshake.
- I regret this already.

10:49.913 --> 10:54.418
Spread them wide, ladies.
This is a random cavity search.

10:54.501 --> 10:57.045
Both: Whoa! Buy a guy a drink first.

10:57.129 --> 10:59.005
- [laughs]
- Did we just say that...

10:59.089 --> 11:00.966
- Oh!
- At the same time?

11:01.049 --> 11:03.719
Look, I saw you talking
to Klaus in the shower.

11:03.803 --> 11:06.847
Now, the Aryan's are good
guys. Don't get me wrong.

11:06.930 --> 11:08.140
But I don't know if you're gonna get

11:08.223 --> 11:10.016
the right attention over there.

11:10.100 --> 11:12.352
Uh, I'd hate to get
lost in a shop that big.

11:12.436 --> 11:14.271
Now we can't offer you the works,

11:14.354 --> 11:16.482
but in the Latin Kings, you'll be a star.

11:16.565 --> 11:20.068
We're number two, and
that means we try harder.

11:20.152 --> 11:22.571
Am I really being courted by two gangs?

11:22.655 --> 11:25.449
Oh, I feel like the belle of the ball.

11:26.867 --> 11:29.662
So, this is the shapeless biographer

11:29.745 --> 11:31.413
I've heard so much about.

11:31.497 --> 11:33.915
We've met several times.

11:33.999 --> 11:35.751
Did you just call me here to insult me?

11:35.835 --> 11:37.377
What is your secret, lady?

11:37.461 --> 11:39.839
I mean, how do you get two
grown men fighting over you

11:39.921 --> 11:41.841
like a foul ball at a football game?

11:41.923 --> 11:43.592
First of all, football
doesn't have foul balls.

11:43.676 --> 11:45.093
Ugh, sports.

11:45.177 --> 11:47.763
Second of all, nobody's fighting over me.

11:47.847 --> 11:49.097
Open your eyes.

11:49.181 --> 11:50.974
BoJack's clearly in love with you.

11:51.057 --> 11:56.647
Wha...?

11:56.730 --> 11:58.190
Get out of here!

11:58.273 --> 11:59.817
Get out of here? Why
would I get out of here?

11:59.900 --> 12:01.985
You get out of here. This is my office.

12:04.446 --> 12:05.865
I get the army men are police,

12:05.906 --> 12:07.449
but what's the mustard packet again?

12:07.533 --> 12:09.284
Oh, that's just a mustard packet.

12:09.368 --> 12:10.870
- It's left over from lunch.
- Oh.

12:10.952 --> 12:12.287
Well, can we move it off the table?

12:12.371 --> 12:13.622
No. I still might want it later.

12:13.706 --> 12:14.874
Good call.

12:14.956 --> 12:16.876
So how do we get the D from here

12:16.958 --> 12:18.627
all the way up to here?

12:18.711 --> 12:20.337
What, with all these cops and mustards,

12:20.420 --> 12:21.922
- it's gonna be a pickle.
- Oh, no.

12:22.005 --> 12:23.632
The pickle's a SWAT van,
but I see your point.

12:23.716 --> 12:27.887
Might be easier to just
ditch the evidence. But how?

12:27.969 --> 12:29.513
I... I don't know.

12:29.596 --> 12:31.640
You think these coffees
would get the juices flowing.

12:31.724 --> 12:33.016
Well, they do have Bailey's in them.

12:33.099 --> 12:34.727
Is that why I feel drunk?

12:34.810 --> 12:36.812
Because I've had, like,
seven or eight coffees.

12:36.896 --> 12:38.355
I mean, I admit, it's been bad for ideas,

12:38.438 --> 12:40.357
but it's been great for camaraderie.

12:40.440 --> 12:41.942
Couldn't agree more.

12:42.025 --> 12:43.610
Ooh, hey. What time is it?

12:43.694 --> 12:45.195
I probably need to move my helicopter.

12:45.278 --> 12:46.697
It's in a two-hour zone.

12:46.780 --> 12:48.949
You beautiful bastard, that's it!

12:49.032 --> 12:51.952
We can pick up the D with your
chopper, fly it out of here,

12:52.035 --> 12:53.537
and then dump it out into the ocean.

12:53.620 --> 12:54.955
Stupendous!

12:55.038 --> 12:56.749
Take that, the ocean.

12:56.832 --> 12:58.542
[phone vibrates and rings]

12:58.625 --> 13:00.794
- What now, Todd?
- Listen.

13:00.878 --> 13:04.047
So, kind of landed myself in a
two-dates-to-the-prom situation.

13:04.130 --> 13:07.384
The dates being prison gangs
and the prom being a jump-in,

13:07.467 --> 13:09.595
so do you remember how
you got out of the same jam

13:09.678 --> 13:10.846
on Horsin' Around?

13:10.930 --> 13:13.098
Ah, a classic conundrum.

13:13.181 --> 13:15.935
Well, I recall one time on
Mr. Peanutbutter's House...

13:16.017 --> 13:17.269
I think he's talking to me, pal.

13:17.352 --> 13:18.729
You know, the guy whose show

13:18.812 --> 13:21.022
invented the two-dates-to-the-prom story.

13:21.106 --> 13:24.150
You may have invented it, but
I think our show perfected it.

13:24.234 --> 13:25.778
The only thing you ever perfected

13:25.861 --> 13:27.613
- was stealing my thunder.
- Stealing your thunder, eh?

13:27.696 --> 13:29.489
Now you're even stealing
the words I'm saying.

13:29.573 --> 13:31.074
You know, it's tough.

13:31.157 --> 13:33.911
I agree with the Latin
Kings on social issues,

13:33.994 --> 13:35.621
but fiscally I'm more of an Aryan.

13:35.704 --> 13:37.456
Well, juggling both never ends well.

13:37.539 --> 13:39.332
Mr. Peanutbutter, anything to contribute?

13:39.416 --> 13:41.209
He's just staring blankly now.

13:41.293 --> 13:44.964
Stealing your thunder.

13:45.046 --> 13:47.674
You could also just bail
me out of here, as I said.

13:47.758 --> 13:49.050
- It's only 50 bucks...
- Got to go, pal.

13:49.134 --> 13:50.427
Hope it's a magical night.

13:50.510 --> 13:51.678
All right, you ready for the plan?

13:51.762 --> 13:53.472
Oh, yeah.

13:53.555 --> 13:55.808
But we are gonna need a big distraction

13:55.891 --> 13:58.226
to keep the eyes off the skies.

13:58.310 --> 13:59.895
You leave that to me.

13:59.979 --> 14:01.855
Whoa, wait. You had a lot to drink.

14:01.939 --> 14:04.149
You better have a cup of coffee.

14:07.486 --> 14:09.237
Who loves you, people?

14:09.321 --> 14:11.323
Look this way, news media.

14:11.406 --> 14:14.785
A celebrity is throwing
away his hard-earned cash.

14:14.868 --> 14:16.286
Everyone pay attention to me.

14:16.369 --> 14:18.872
Oh, it's only one-dollar bills, folks.

14:18.956 --> 14:20.248
Don't bother.

14:20.332 --> 14:22.292
No, it's still free, spendable money.

14:22.375 --> 14:24.085
This is a huge story.

14:24.169 --> 14:25.629
Dollars are like the new penny.

14:25.712 --> 14:28.131
Yeah. Cash is for poor people.

14:28.214 --> 14:29.633
What is wrong with you bozos?

14:29.716 --> 14:32.218
Just riot over the damn money already.

Beyoncé has been injured.

14:49.862 --> 14:51.363
Details are sketchy at this point,

but we do know Beyoncé is a survivor,

14:53.615 --> 14:56.326

Mr. Peanutbutter, take her home.

15:27.941 --> 15:29.150
Doctors have confirmed

15:29.234 --> 15:32.445
that Beyoncé will never perform again.

15:32.529 --> 15:36.116
This just in. A break in the
story of the Hollywoo heist.

15:53.258 --> 15:54.551
Oh, I'll tell you why.

15:54.634 --> 15:57.387
I did it all for my girlfriend, Diane.

All: Aww.

15:59.431 --> 16:01.266
Son of a bitch.

16:01.349 --> 16:04.436
That literal son of a bitch.

16:04.519 --> 16:07.397
If you're joining us, Mr.
Peanutbutter has confessed

16:07.480 --> 16:10.316
to stealing the D for his girlfriend Diane

16:10.400 --> 16:13.070
in what many are calling
the most romantic gesture

16:13.153 --> 16:15.196
in the history of romance and gestures.

16:15.280 --> 16:17.074
We now await the L.A.P.D.'s move.

Wow, Mr. Peanutbutter,
uh, it's kind of a lot.

Do you love anything or anyone?

what you're talking about.

17:31.439 --> 17:33.358
I do have a life outside of you, you know.

Mr. Peanutbutter took my
D and gave it to Diane.

17:36.236 --> 17:38.697
Once again, he completely ripped me off.

Oh, right. That whole thing.

17:53.753 --> 17:55.421
as a grand display of affection?

17:55.505 --> 17:57.257
That's Mr. Peanutbutter.

17:57.340 --> 18:00.677
You're right. It's Mr.
Peanutbutter all over.

18:00.760 --> 18:02.387
It's the kind of bold, romantic gesture

18:02.470 --> 18:04.056
they base movies on.

18:04.139 --> 18:05.557
Actually, that's not a bad idea.

18:05.640 --> 18:08.309
Lora? Check if anyone's
bought the rights yet.

18:08.393 --> 18:09.644
Can we keep this about me, please?

18:09.728 --> 18:11.479
Even if he stole your stealing of the D,

18:11.563 --> 18:14.315
what he made his was
telling Diane how he felt

18:14.399 --> 18:15.525
from his heart.

18:15.608 --> 18:16.902
You could never say it to me,

18:16.985 --> 18:18.486
and you still can't say it to her.

18:18.570 --> 18:20.530
That's not true. I can express feelings.

18:20.613 --> 18:24.659
Nothing on the outside.
Nothing on the inside.

18:24.743 --> 18:26.411
Look, I got to bounce.
Quick question, though.

18:26.494 --> 18:29.414
Would you see Cate Blanchett
in a movie about Eva Braun?

18:29.497 --> 18:31.083
Why are you wasting my time with this?

18:31.166 --> 18:34.211
- Of course I would. Who wouldn't?
- Huh.

18:34.294 --> 18:36.004
[disco music plays]

18:36.088 --> 18:38.048
And that's why Eva Braun

18:38.131 --> 18:40.508
was like the fifth
Beatle of the Third Reich.

18:40.592 --> 18:46.639
Wow. I never knew neo-Nazis
were so interested in Nazis.

18:46.723 --> 18:48.433
You got some great moves, Todd.

18:48.516 --> 18:51.978
You dance like a white man, and I love it.

18:52.062 --> 18:53.980
Hey, no disrespect,

18:54.064 --> 18:57.234
but I got a few chess pieces
I forgot need whittling.

18:57.317 --> 18:58.568
[panting] Oh, excuse me.

18:58.651 --> 19:00.904
Oh, thank God you're back.

19:00.987 --> 19:03.406
I was getting nervous that
you left me for another gang.

19:03.489 --> 19:05.951
[laughs]

19:06.034 --> 19:08.578
If that happened, I'd have to kill you.

19:08.661 --> 19:09.829
[laughter]

19:09.913 --> 19:11.915
[bleats]

19:14.626 --> 19:15.919
Thank you for rescheduling

19:16.002 --> 19:18.213
given your recent, uh, everything.

19:18.297 --> 19:20.966
Yeah. That was really something.

19:21.049 --> 19:23.969
I guess he makes your heart stand Stiller?

19:24.052 --> 19:26.805
Yeah, but for some reason
the jury's Stiller out

19:26.888 --> 19:28.431
on how I feel about it.

19:28.514 --> 19:30.350
Well, that's because it wasn't for you.

19:30.433 --> 19:33.019
That wasn't a Diane thing. It
was a Mr. Peanutbutter thing.

19:33.103 --> 19:35.105
Well, what would be a Diane thing?

19:35.188 --> 19:37.649
A Diane thing would be something that shows

19:37.732 --> 19:39.567
he really knows you,

19:39.651 --> 19:42.821
like giving you an iPod loaded
with all your favorite podcasts,

19:42.904 --> 19:44.447
or a practical houseplant,

19:44.530 --> 19:46.283
or surprising you with a bound album

19:46.366 --> 19:47.993
of photos and emails he saved.

19:48.076 --> 19:50.829
That's... That's what the
Diane I know would want.

19:50.912 --> 19:52.080
What are you saying to me?

19:52.164 --> 19:53.581
Just that you should be

19:53.665 --> 19:55.041
with someone who knows you.

19:55.125 --> 19:57.252
Yeah? Like who?

19:57.336 --> 19:59.129
- I...
- [device beeps]

19:59.212 --> 20:00.672
Whoa, were we... Were we taping?

20:00.755 --> 20:02.090
Um, okay.

20:02.174 --> 20:03.842
Uh, you want to hear my Andy Dick story?

20:03.925 --> 20:05.468
It's a doozie.

20:07.137 --> 20:10.182
All we ask for is 10% of anything pilfered.

20:10.265 --> 20:12.392
Drugs, cigarettes.

20:12.475 --> 20:14.060
I mean, that's the standard gang rate.

20:14.144 --> 20:19.565
Hey, I got to go, uh, do a prison thing.

20:19.649 --> 20:22.694
That sounds legitimate. We
are in prison, after all.

20:22.777 --> 20:24.737
[panting]

20:24.863 --> 20:26.531
Whew. Hey.

20:26.614 --> 20:28.825
White people, right?

20:28.908 --> 20:31.828
Todd? Why in the name of Pat Buchanan

20:31.911 --> 20:33.997
are you dressed like a Latin King?

20:34.080 --> 20:35.540
- Uh, what...
- What the hell, bro?

20:35.623 --> 20:37.542
- Are you playing both sides?
- Look, guys,

20:37.625 --> 20:41.004
I didn't want to choose between
you because I like you both.

20:41.087 --> 20:43.173
Look, in fact, if you just took the time

20:43.256 --> 20:46.092
to get to know each
other the way you did me,

20:46.176 --> 20:48.594
I think you'd agree we
don't need gangs anymore

20:48.678 --> 20:53.558
because, deep down, we're all just people.

20:53.641 --> 20:55.394
What do you say?

20:55.476 --> 20:58.021
This just in. A standoff at the Super Max

20:58.104 --> 21:00.940
has turned into a full-on race war.

21:01.024 --> 21:04.277
But first, America has fallen
in love with Hollywoo it-couple,

21:04.361 --> 21:06.529
Mr. Peanutbutter and Diane...

21:06.612 --> 21:08.489
[sighs]

21:08.573 --> 21:10.700
[cell phone vibrating]

21:10.783 --> 21:14.079
Diane? Is that you?

21:15.914 --> 21:18.333
Hey. It's, um, me.

21:18.417 --> 21:19.751
[nervously laughs]

21:19.834 --> 21:22.128
Look, uh, things got a bit weird earlier,

21:22.212 --> 21:24.714
so I... I want to make sure
that we're still on for tomorrow

21:24.797 --> 21:27.217
to talk about the time I
sneezed on Marisa Tomei.

21:27.300 --> 21:29.052
I'm really sorry about before.

21:29.135 --> 21:30.803
I know the D was overkill,

21:30.887 --> 21:33.432
so I got you something more personal.

21:33.514 --> 21:34.849
Aww.

21:34.933 --> 21:37.643
I also wanted to just, um, let you know

21:37.727 --> 21:39.979
how much I appreciate you
working on this book with me.

21:41.356 --> 21:45.235
I know I sometimes get carried away,

21:45.318 --> 21:47.028
but it's because I love you so much.

21:47.112 --> 21:48.988
You're a catch, Diane,

21:49.114 --> 21:51.824
and I think you know how much I love catch.

21:51.908 --> 21:54.369
And I'm sorry if I've
been difficult in any way

21:54.453 --> 21:56.121
during this process.

21:56.204 --> 21:57.830
You know, it's... It's
really hard to have somebody,

21:57.914 --> 22:00.500
I don't know, know you, I guess.

22:00.583 --> 22:03.044
And you do, uh, know me, Diane.

22:03.128 --> 22:05.713
We're very different,
but I think we bring out

22:05.797 --> 22:07.340
the best in each other.

22:07.424 --> 22:09.050
It's like you're chocolate and I'm...

22:09.134 --> 22:10.927
- Peanutbutter?
- [laughs] What? Now see?

22:11.010 --> 22:13.221
That was so much better
than what I was gonna say.

22:13.305 --> 22:16.349
- I was gonna say carrots.
- [laughs]

22:16.433 --> 22:17.976
And I know I'm not the perfect guy.

22:18.059 --> 22:21.438
I actually kind of hate
myself a lot of the time.

22:21.521 --> 22:25.275
But when... When I'm with
you, I, uh, don't hate myself.

22:25.358 --> 22:27.735
I like being around you,

22:27.819 --> 22:29.279
and I don't know if I ever told you that

22:29.404 --> 22:32.240
in so many words, so I'm telling you.

22:32.324 --> 22:35.368
Diane, I've got an
important question to ask.

22:35.452 --> 22:38.955
No cameras, no big spectacle.

22:39.080 --> 22:40.957
Just me and you.

22:41.040 --> 22:42.417
Call me back.

22:42.501 --> 22:44.377
This was BoJack, by the way.

22:44.461 --> 22:45.962
Horseman, obviously.

22:46.045 --> 22:47.880
Will you do the honor...

22:47.964 --> 22:49.132
[cell phone chimes]

22:49.215 --> 22:51.259
Of becoming Mrs. Peanutbutter?

22:51.343 --> 22:55.347
Wow. This is happening so fast.

22:55.430 --> 22:57.849
Yes. I'll marry you.

22:57.932 --> 22:59.351
But I'm keeping my last name.

22:59.434 --> 23:02.187
You hear that? She said yes!

23:02.270 --> 23:03.604
- Let's kick it!
- [festive music plays]

23:03.688 --> 23:05.606
Erica, did you hear she said yes?

23:05.690 --> 23:08.443
Come on in here! All right!

23:08.527 --> 23:10.529
[fireworks pop and crackle]

23:10.611 --> 23:13.365
She's not gonna call. Get
out the consolation scotch.

23:13.448 --> 23:14.949
[vibrates]

23:15.033 --> 23:16.576
It's her! Make that celebration scotch.

23:16.659 --> 23:18.870
- What's the difference?
- It's the same scotch!

23:18.953 --> 23:20.121
Diane! Hey, you!

23:20.205 --> 23:21.873
Hey.

23:21.956 --> 23:23.666
So this is weird.

23:23.749 --> 23:26.461
I'm engaged.

23:26.545 --> 23:28.547
Oh, wow.

23:28.629 --> 23:30.549
To Mr. Peanutbutter?

23:30.631 --> 23:32.884
I saw you left me a voice-mail...

23:32.967 --> 23:34.844
Delete it. It's just a
drunken recipe for Bundt cake.

23:34.927 --> 23:36.095
Not important.

23:36.179 --> 23:37.556
Okay. I got to go.

23:37.638 --> 23:39.224
They're about to move the D back.

23:39.307 --> 23:41.934
- See you tomorrow?
- Absolutely.

23:44.270 --> 23:47.732
Well, nobody knows me like you.

23:50.735 --> 23:52.987
Pilot: Time to bring this baby home.

23:53.071 --> 23:55.156
To think I went from flying
missions over Kandahar

23:55.240 --> 23:57.242
to this cushy crap.

23:58.784 --> 24:00.203
I spoke too soon!

24:00.286 --> 24:02.830
Black Hawk down! Black Hawk down!

24:02.914 --> 24:05.584
See, you guys aren't so different.

24:05.666 --> 24:07.668
- [grunting]
- [helicopter approaching]

24:07.752 --> 24:09.629
[crashing]

24:11.839 --> 24:13.633
We're free! We're free!

24:13.716 --> 24:14.926
- Yeah!
- Freedom!

24:15.009 --> 24:17.011
- I am free!
- Freedom!

24:17.095 --> 24:19.097
Oh, wow.

24:19.180 --> 24:20.765
What a twist, huh?

24:20.848 --> 24:24.477
And they say there's no
new stories in Hollywoo.
