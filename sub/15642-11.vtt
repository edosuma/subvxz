WEBVTT

00:01.084 --> 00:04.008
- Previously on Hit the Floor:
- What are we doing?

00:04.129 --> 00:07.474
Having a good time. We can
keep having fun or not. Up to you.

00:07.591 --> 00:10.515
- Thanks for covering for me.
- Told you, I got you.

00:10.636 --> 00:13.230
I'm about to take your career
to a new level.

00:13.514 --> 00:16.142
I haven't been coy
about how attractive I find you.

00:16.265 --> 00:18.439
I'm not interested
in what turns you on.

00:21.313 --> 00:24.533
I'm in Chase's storage unit.
Found a list of routing numbers.

00:24.650 --> 00:27.199
- Gambling winnings.
- Have him for corruption.

00:27.319 --> 00:30.323
Mia was a good one.
But Olivia was the best.

00:30.489 --> 00:32.491
That's the mike I wore to see the ME.

00:32.658 --> 00:34.752
Oscar could have killed Olivia too.

01:11.029 --> 01:12.406
No!

01:16.660 --> 01:18.628
- All of the bank records?
- Gone.

01:19.288 --> 01:21.541
What about the recording I made?

01:22.416 --> 01:23.793
Oscar came by.

01:23.959 --> 01:26.758
I pulled him away for a second.

01:28.505 --> 01:30.382
What if he...?

01:32.968 --> 01:34.311
He asked me about you.

01:35.512 --> 01:38.482
- What if he knows I went to the ME?
- I covered for you.

01:38.640 --> 01:42.144
No of fence, but this stuff
doesn't happen when I work by myself.

01:42.311 --> 01:45.064
I gotta back away slowly from this.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.568
Good luck with everything.

01:50.485 --> 01:52.829
If Oscar comes after us,
he could find out--

01:52.988 --> 01:54.490
He won't.

01:54.656 --> 01:58.911
The envelope was on my desk.
The only one connected to it is me.

01:59.036 --> 02:00.754
I Will fix this.

02:00.912 --> 02:04.416
But for now, I think it's best
if none of us are seen together.

02:09.670 --> 02:11.639
Be careful, Sloane.

02:21.642 --> 02:25.021
- What is it?
- Inside Sports Network got a source

02:25.145 --> 02:27.898
inside the Devils
that says I'm playing injured.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.823
You know what kind of target
this puts on my back?

02:31.902 --> 02:33.825
Boston's gonna be all over me.

02:35.280 --> 02:36.873
What source?

02:37.032 --> 02:40.081
The only people who knew
were you, me and Derek.

02:41.912 --> 02:43.585
Derek's got your back.

02:43.705 --> 02:45.378
The person who doesn't is Zero.

02:46.541 --> 02:47.884
I warned you about him.

02:48.627 --> 02:50.425
Zero wants your seat at the table.

02:50.545 --> 02:53.298
The less you play,
the better his chances.

02:53.924 --> 02:57.929
I don't know how he would have
found out, but my money's on him.

03:02.307 --> 03:04.025
I need that ring, Jelena.

03:04.393 --> 03:07.363
You play a bunch of games
all season.

03:07.562 --> 03:09.985
But in the end,
there's only one that matters.

03:11.608 --> 03:13.030
Go big or go home.

03:33.171 --> 03:35.469
Was there an earthquake
I didn't feel?

03:36.049 --> 03:38.518
I was just rearranging things.

03:39.636 --> 03:41.263
Onto the floor?

03:42.180 --> 03:45.104
I was moving a desk,
and everything slid off.

03:45.392 --> 03:48.316
Did you get a chance to look
at my choreography book?

03:49.146 --> 03:53.447
- Not yet.
- I have new pages to add anyway.

03:53.692 --> 03:56.992
I've been working overtime.
I wanna keep doing this.

03:59.656 --> 04:01.658
I'm not the only one
working overtime.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.541
I saw Jelena in the locker room
last night.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.455
Jelena was here?

04:06.621 --> 04:09.591
Looks like my dance
made a bigger impact than I thought.

04:12.961 --> 04:14.634
Your medical examiner's gone.

04:14.796 --> 04:17.845
No one has seen him since yesterday.
Neither has his wife.

04:17.966 --> 04:20.935
Made a big withdrawal from
their savings and disappeared.

04:21.052 --> 04:23.305
I knew he opened his mouth.
Find him.

04:23.430 --> 04:26.479
I need to know who this girl is
that's sniffing around me.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.318
I'm on it.

04:31.813 --> 04:34.236
It's my captain. Harris.

04:34.399 --> 04:36.117
No, what's going on?

04:37.152 --> 04:38.699
Who is this?

04:39.446 --> 04:40.823
All right, I'm heading in.

04:42.908 --> 04:45.252
Chase Vincent was cleared
of Olivia's murder.

04:46.036 --> 04:49.586
- What did you say?
- Her time of death was 10:26 p.m.

04:49.748 --> 04:51.625
Her watch was smashed.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.544
Around that time, he ran a light.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.883
Traffic camera caught him,
he had no idea.

04:56.004 --> 04:57.847
Ticket just came in.

04:58.507 --> 05:00.384
He couldn't have done it.

05:01.301 --> 05:04.100
- You have an alibi?
- Why would I need one?

05:04.554 --> 05:06.522
The department's
reopening the case.

05:06.681 --> 05:08.979
All Chase could ever talk about
was you.

05:09.100 --> 05:12.821
How you did it,
how you forced him to sign the plea.

05:12.979 --> 05:17.109
I'll do my best to push him off,
but you should get your house in order

05:17.275 --> 05:19.903
and hope they find someone else.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.447
<i>--Game-changer
heading into the finals.</i>

05:22.614 --> 05:24.036
<i>With so much on the line</i>

05:24.199 --> 05:27.078
<i>having one of the Devils'
star players...</i>

05:27.369 --> 05:29.463
Pretty nasty rumour about Terrence.

05:29.621 --> 05:31.123
Not a rumour.

05:32.958 --> 05:35.802
You did this. What do you know?

05:37.587 --> 05:42.889
Well, let's just say
the wall is coming down. Get it?

05:48.223 --> 05:50.442
Wouldn't Derek be the better target?

05:50.600 --> 05:54.525
If Terrence really is injured,
isn't Derek the bigger threat?

05:55.230 --> 05:57.232
I don't have anything on Derek.

05:57.399 --> 05:59.197
<i>--For the Devils organisation.</i>

05:59.359 --> 06:01.407
<i>More big news out of Los Angeles.</i>

06:01.570 --> 06:05.200
<i>This one involving Chase Vincent,
who's out of jail and in the clear.</i>

06:05.323 --> 06:08.418
<i>Footage of Chase Vincent has surfaced
from a traffic camera</i>

06:08.535 --> 06:10.833
<i>at the time
of Olivia Vincent's murder.</i>

06:10.996 --> 06:13.124
<i>With Mr. Vincent no longer a suspect,</i>

06:13.290 --> 06:16.590
<i>police are reopening their investigation
to find her killer.</i>

06:16.751 --> 06:19.630
His lawyer says
Chase isn't making a statement.

06:19.796 --> 06:22.515
He doesn't want anyone
knowing where he is.

06:22.799 --> 06:24.426
Do they have any other leads?

06:25.135 --> 06:26.432
It doesn't say.

06:29.681 --> 06:31.524
I hope they catch whoever did it.

06:31.683 --> 06:33.151
Yeah, me too.

06:42.861 --> 06:44.204
I got your message.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.407
Have a seat, dear.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.375
It's come to my attention

06:56.541 --> 07:00.466
that a young woman has become
quite interested in my business.

07:00.629 --> 07:04.304
You'll forgive me if the first young
woman that came to mind was you.

07:05.008 --> 07:07.056
Well, I don't blame you,

07:07.218 --> 07:09.767
but unfortunately,
I also can't help you.

07:11.681 --> 07:13.900
You know
when you're sitting on something

07:14.017 --> 07:16.111
and you don't know
what you're sitting on

07:16.227 --> 07:17.570
until suddenly you do?

07:18.396 --> 07:20.490
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

07:21.232 --> 07:23.826
Olivia was getting really mouthy
before she died

07:23.944 --> 07:25.946
so I had her followed.

07:26.571 --> 07:30.997
Turns out she met with some people
right before she was killed.

07:31.660 --> 07:32.957
Including you.

07:34.871 --> 07:38.501
By your reaction, clearly,
you were hoping to keep it a secret.

07:38.583 --> 07:41.177
I don't know what you discussed

07:41.336 --> 07:45.261
but I'm told your exchange
got particularly heated.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.176
I didn't think much of it

07:48.301 --> 07:51.646
until Chase was exonerated
for her murder.

07:52.305 --> 07:57.357
Now this information becomes
a little more interesting to me.

07:57.686 --> 07:59.029
And maybe to you too.

08:01.189 --> 08:04.534
If I thought someone
was making trouble for me.

08:04.651 --> 08:07.200
I might have to make trouble
for them right back.

08:10.782 --> 08:14.332
Oscar, you have nothing to worry
about from me.

08:34.639 --> 08:37.563
"Ecstasy's failure at the box office
has led the studio

08:37.726 --> 08:41.481
to put their next two movies
with Lionel Davenport on ice."

08:41.980 --> 08:44.028
Well, this is a nightmare.

08:48.611 --> 08:51.205
What's the matter?
Not interesting enough for you?

08:51.322 --> 08:52.949
Sorry. It's Oscar.

08:53.616 --> 08:56.369
- What about him?
- He called me this morning.

08:56.786 --> 09:00.165
Said he thinks there might be
a woman targeting him.

09:00.790 --> 09:04.294
- So?
- So I know there is.

09:04.502 --> 09:08.848
I made a deal to stop it.
At least I thought I did.

09:09.007 --> 09:10.554
So tell him.

09:11.593 --> 09:14.688
- If I did, it would be bad for me.
- How bad?

09:16.389 --> 09:19.017
- Prison bad.
- Jude.

09:19.142 --> 09:21.941
I can't let him be taken down, Lionel.

09:22.103 --> 09:23.446
He's my father.

09:23.605 --> 09:25.278
He is a sperm donor.

09:28.651 --> 09:30.699
I need to go think.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.163
I'm sorry.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.312
It's interesting
we're doing this here, Derek.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.985
Players prefer doing these
interviews at home.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.779
Well, this is my house.

10:07.899 --> 10:11.494
With Terrence rumoured to be injured,
that's a possibility, isn't it?

10:11.611 --> 10:15.081
If someone's gonna get the Devils'
title, it's you. Feel pressure?

10:15.198 --> 10:17.576
Absolutely.
Every time I step on the floor.

10:17.700 --> 10:20.328
It's part of the job, I love it.
I love the Devils.

10:20.453 --> 10:23.047
Your contract's up next year.
You're staying?

10:23.206 --> 10:25.504
You could not wait to ask that.

10:25.667 --> 10:29.012
We're starting to talk.
I don't comment on that kind of stuff.

10:30.797 --> 10:32.720
Hey, boss.

10:32.882 --> 10:35.351
Figured I'd get in
a little extra practise.

10:35.510 --> 10:38.684
Maybe get you a fancy banner
for the new arena.

10:39.055 --> 10:41.854
You'll have to wait for Derek
to finish his interview.

10:43.017 --> 10:44.690
Thanks to Terrence's injury

10:45.562 --> 10:48.532
there may be a new king
on the throne.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.370
You had a job for me?

11:02.996 --> 11:05.624
Convince me you're still my girl.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.127
You don't need convincing.

11:10.628 --> 11:15.350
Had a lot on my plate,
but I'm where I need to be.

11:15.967 --> 11:18.686
So, what can I do for you?

11:20.763 --> 11:24.108
I'm about to enter
some rather tricky negotiations.

11:24.267 --> 11:26.110
I need to make sure they go my way.

11:26.644 --> 11:28.021
Okay.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.361
This particular gentleman
enjoys a party.

11:30.523 --> 11:34.153
I want you to throw him one.
And I want you to get it on tape.

11:34.319 --> 11:37.698
- What kind of party?
- Party he'd never want anyone to see.

11:38.448 --> 11:42.544
With however many illegal substances
this will afford you.

11:43.661 --> 11:45.004
Who's the guest of honour?

11:45.622 --> 11:47.624
Derek Roman.

11:57.425 --> 11:58.768
<i>Hey-</i>

12:03.598 --> 12:06.021
What if I can't bring it home, Sloane?

12:07.894 --> 12:09.362
Don't think like that.

12:10.939 --> 12:13.067
Look how far you've come.

12:14.400 --> 12:19.748
I know I should be happy
that the Devils made it to the finals.

12:19.822 --> 12:22.245
I'm not talking about the season,
Pete.

12:23.952 --> 12:25.954
I'm talking about life.

12:26.120 --> 12:28.919
Twenty years ago,
you couldn't take care of anybody.

12:29.540 --> 12:32.965
Now, you're responsible
for an entire team.

12:33.127 --> 12:37.223
You're there for Ahsha, for me.

12:39.050 --> 12:40.393
I'm so proud of you.

12:44.555 --> 12:47.604
That means a lot to me.

12:51.980 --> 12:54.904
Sometimes, you think
you have all the time in the world.

12:56.401 --> 12:58.028
But you don't.

12:59.362 --> 13:02.491
Time goes by so fast.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.744
It's so precious.

13:09.330 --> 13:11.298
There are things you wanna say.

13:13.167 --> 13:15.545
And we haven't said this

13:15.920 --> 13:17.513
and I need to say this.

13:21.217 --> 13:22.639
I love you.

13:25.847 --> 13:30.148
Sloane, I've never loved anyone
the way I love you.

14:37.752 --> 14:40.050
- I think coach is letting you play.
- Yeah.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.591
I promised I'd see the doctor
after the final.

14:43.674 --> 14:45.142
That was a tense practise.

14:45.259 --> 14:48.308
- Zero took off.
- Should've let you kill him at the roast.

14:48.471 --> 14:50.064
What did he do now?

14:50.556 --> 14:53.230
Jelena thinks he's the one
who leaked my injury.

14:53.393 --> 14:54.895
And I think so too.

14:55.061 --> 14:56.529
Why would he do that?

14:57.980 --> 14:59.903
He wants to take over the team.

15:00.024 --> 15:01.526
He told J that straight up.

15:01.692 --> 15:05.322
He's been trying to separate me
and you since his first day in L.A.

15:05.571 --> 15:09.246
Somehow he heard
that we weren't getting along so great.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.009
Big game tomorrow.

15:18.167 --> 15:19.544
Huge.

15:19.710 --> 15:22.634
I bet Derek had a lot to say about it.

15:22.797 --> 15:25.050
Congratulations
on getting that interview.

15:25.174 --> 15:27.017
Thanks.

15:27.218 --> 15:28.811
It's just interesting

15:28.970 --> 15:31.940
how Inside Sports Network
broke the story about Terrence.

15:32.056 --> 15:33.979
Now you're here
interviewing players.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.898
Are you upset I got a promotion?

15:36.060 --> 15:38.939
Depends.
Did you screw over Terrence to get it?

15:39.480 --> 15:43.280
Come on, German. I work for
Inside Sports Network, not the Devils.

15:43.443 --> 15:46.993
Obviously. How do you think people
here would feel if they knew?

15:47.113 --> 15:49.866
I can't control if someone
comes with information.

15:49.991 --> 15:54.087
It makes it a lot easier for someone to
do that when you're here all the time.

15:54.203 --> 15:58.208
I'm here all the time because of you.

16:07.258 --> 16:10.102
I'll see you when you get back
from Boston.

16:10.261 --> 16:13.561
Let's get dinner, celebrate your win.

16:23.524 --> 16:25.492
- Derek, hey.
- You and Zero.

16:26.527 --> 16:28.575
- What?
- What did you promise him?

16:29.238 --> 16:30.581
He signed a 3O million--

16:30.740 --> 16:34.244
He's been playing me and Terrence
against each other since day one.

16:34.368 --> 16:36.291
Why would he?
The only ones who knew

16:36.412 --> 16:39.382
how bad things were between me
and T were me, T, and you.

16:39.499 --> 16:42.298
- Derek.
- You went from a desk jockey

16:42.460 --> 16:44.133
to his agent.

16:44.462 --> 16:47.386
From a bus pass to tooling around
in brand-new Porsches

16:47.465 --> 16:49.217
with his name on the pink slip.

16:49.592 --> 16:52.141
- I'm good at my job.
- Deny it again.

16:54.889 --> 16:56.436
Does he know about the coke?

16:58.100 --> 17:00.899
No. Derek, come on.

17:01.020 --> 17:04.319
We need each other.
You're my alibi for Olivia. I'm yours.

17:04.482 --> 17:07.361
- Screw that.
- Derek!

17:08.694 --> 17:10.617
I'm dealing with something
right now.

17:10.738 --> 17:15.289
If you take away my alibi
on top of that, I'm underwater.

17:16.202 --> 17:18.329
Drown, bitch.

17:34.512 --> 17:35.855
Ahsha?

17:37.515 --> 17:40.644
- Surprise.
- What are you doing in Boston?

17:41.060 --> 17:43.813
You think we'd let you guys go it
alone?

17:44.772 --> 17:48.367
We're taking it to the streets.
Infiltrating enemy territory.

17:48.526 --> 17:50.904
We'll probably get stoned,
but we'll look hot.

17:51.028 --> 17:54.123
- Why are you laughing?
- No, it's cool. It's just--

17:54.282 --> 17:57.377
It's kind of weird hearing you
call Boston enemy territory.

17:57.493 --> 18:00.417
- Last time you and I were here--
- BC was scouting you.

18:00.538 --> 18:03.542
Remember we went to the wharf
and ordered lobster?

18:03.666 --> 18:05.418
We thought we were so fancy.

18:05.543 --> 18:06.920
Now we're back.

18:07.878 --> 18:10.848
You're a coach, I'm a dancer.

18:11.007 --> 18:13.226
Which I've gotta go be right now.

18:15.136 --> 18:16.888
Good luck. Later.

18:17.221 --> 18:18.564
You too.

18:32.737 --> 18:34.034
Here we come.

18:43.664 --> 18:45.541
Hey, Chuck, get a load of this.

20:43.951 --> 20:47.330
<i>Boston wins on their home court,
103 to 99.</i>

20:47.496 --> 20:48.839
<i>Game seven, Los Angeles.</i>

20:48.998 --> 20:52.468
- You barely played me.
- You're lucky I played you at all.

20:52.543 --> 20:54.716
- You're injured.
- We have one game left.

20:54.837 --> 20:57.260
- Play me at 100 percent.
- You know the risk.

20:57.381 --> 21:00.555
- So the hell what?
- If that's what Terrence wants, let him.

21:00.676 --> 21:02.804
Yeah, me too.

21:03.512 --> 21:04.855
You want 100 percent?

21:06.557 --> 21:08.605
I'll play you 100 percent.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.770
Ice the leg.

21:14.690 --> 21:17.034
Win or lose, when this is over

21:17.193 --> 21:20.367
I'm gonna put my fist through
the back of your blond head.

21:34.710 --> 21:36.633
Jelena, it's Sloane.

21:36.796 --> 21:39.049
See me when you get back.

21:46.555 --> 21:48.273
Lionel?

21:52.394 --> 21:56.444
I don't understand.

21:56.607 --> 21:58.860
You don't understand what?

21:59.109 --> 22:00.782
You

22:01.654 --> 22:03.531
and Pete.

22:04.532 --> 22:07.786
You were years ago.

22:07.993 --> 22:10.166
He told me that.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.297
You told me that.

22:13.040 --> 22:15.213
There you both are

22:15.668 --> 22:18.672
telling each other
how much you loved each other.

22:18.838 --> 22:20.681
I saw you.

22:21.257 --> 22:25.979
I was standing outside of his door,
and I saw you.

22:28.222 --> 22:30.725
Whatever conversation
you wanna have,

22:30.891 --> 22:32.484
you need to have it with Pete.

22:32.601 --> 22:37.072
When we first got together,
I didn't even know that you existed. I--

22:37.314 --> 22:41.239
Then I started hearing things, stories.
More and more.

22:42.528 --> 22:44.326
And I asked him.

22:44.822 --> 22:47.746
I said, "Who's Sloane Hayes?

22:47.992 --> 22:49.335
Did you love her?

22:50.119 --> 22:52.417
Do you still love her?"

22:53.372 --> 22:56.342
He told me no. He'd laugh.

22:56.500 --> 22:58.753
"You're being paranoid, Lionel."

22:58.919 --> 23:01.013
So I started telling myself that.

23:01.171 --> 23:04.300
I said,
"You're being paranoid, Lionel."

23:04.842 --> 23:07.971
- Lionel.
- I never had a chance.

23:08.137 --> 23:10.936
You haunted us like a ghost.

23:11.682 --> 23:13.184
I think you should go.

23:14.768 --> 23:16.441
Do you?

23:17.771 --> 23:19.114
You think I should go.

23:19.773 --> 23:25.576
Lionel, I have way too much going on
right now to participate in

23:25.988 --> 23:27.831
whatever this is.

23:27.990 --> 23:29.663
My God, you're smug.

23:33.037 --> 23:35.916
And you're obviously having
some kind of breakdown.

23:36.415 --> 23:38.133
I will not be pulled into it.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.378
We all made choices.

23:40.461 --> 23:42.463
You chose to enable a man
so he'd stay.

23:42.588 --> 23:45.091
Ply him with alcohol
so he'd need you.

23:45.257 --> 23:48.010
If you wanna dissect your situation,
start with that.

23:48.177 --> 23:49.975
Don't you dare.

23:50.137 --> 23:53.687
If I never existed,
you still wouldn't be with Pete.

23:53.849 --> 23:55.317
I'm an excuse.

23:55.851 --> 23:57.228
You're a home wrecker.

23:57.394 --> 24:00.944
You're a deluded actress who's
convinced herself this role is hers.

24:04.777 --> 24:06.905
Hate's a strong word.

24:07.988 --> 24:10.992
And I hate you, Sloane Hayes.

24:12.618 --> 24:14.712
I hate you.

24:45.150 --> 24:46.493
Oscar, have a second?

24:56.578 --> 24:58.046
I agonised over this

24:58.205 --> 25:01.254
but I finally decided
I have to tell you something.

25:01.417 --> 25:05.422
Something I've known about for a while
and I should have told you sooner.

25:05.546 --> 25:07.344
No matter what it costs me.

25:08.090 --> 25:10.138
I know.

25:11.093 --> 25:12.595
You do?

25:14.430 --> 25:19.186
Before the groundbreaking,
I had Olivia Vincent followed.

25:20.227 --> 25:24.323
I know she met with you. I assume
she was holding something over you

25:24.440 --> 25:26.408
trying to get you to turn against me.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.869
Yeah, but I never would have.

25:29.153 --> 25:31.781
The thing is, with Chase exonerated

25:31.905 --> 25:36.911
anyone Olivia threatened
becomes a suspect in her murder.

25:37.036 --> 25:39.209
You think I killed Olivia?

25:40.956 --> 25:43.300
I don't really know you, Jude.

25:43.459 --> 25:46.053
So I had you checked out.

25:46.378 --> 25:48.631
And now I know
what she threatened you with.

25:50.466 --> 25:53.811
Your neighbour says
you have a regular visitor.

25:53.969 --> 25:55.892
A gentleman.

25:56.346 --> 26:00.601
Apparently your walls are thin,
and the two of you are rather loud.

26:03.687 --> 26:09.239
If you thought confessing your
secret gay life was going to bond us,

26:09.735 --> 26:12.363
then you know me
about as well as I know you.

26:15.532 --> 26:19.207
Your mother was a simple woman
who knew her limitations.

26:19.369 --> 26:22.213
She was too small for the big life
I was making

26:22.372 --> 26:25.876
so she gave up and moved on.

26:26.627 --> 26:29.346
You've been trying to take after me.

26:29.755 --> 26:31.553
You should try to take after her.

26:34.301 --> 26:37.271
You will never have my approval.

26:39.765 --> 26:41.642
Dad, I--

26:43.852 --> 26:45.729
I don't have a son.

26:48.607 --> 26:51.360
I assume that's all you came to say.

26:57.241 --> 26:58.834
Yeah.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.245
That's all.

27:39.241 --> 27:40.743
<i>Hey-</i>

27:41.201 --> 27:42.703
I heard the music.

27:43.704 --> 27:45.502
Well, if you're gonna watch,

27:45.622 --> 27:48.967
you might as well have the best seat
in the house.

28:36.423 --> 28:37.970
I should go.

28:38.550 --> 28:40.473
There's someone
I'm supposed to meet.

28:40.594 --> 28:42.016
Yeah, okay.

28:44.223 --> 28:45.770
Yeah.

28:58.278 --> 29:00.121
<i>- HEY-
- HEY-</i>

29:01.365 --> 29:03.288
Sorry you guys lost in Boston.

29:04.576 --> 29:07.079
- It was a close one.
- Yeah.

29:07.246 --> 29:11.843
Hey, I'm sorry I haven't been
by the Playground lately.

29:12.501 --> 29:13.969
I stopped drinking.

29:15.003 --> 29:16.801
That's great.

29:18.799 --> 29:21.143
Sure that's why you stopped
coming by?

29:22.511 --> 29:27.733
Truthfully,
I didn't know what to say to you

29:28.058 --> 29:29.776
after you broke up with me.

29:30.394 --> 29:33.819
I feel bad for any trouble
I caused you.

29:34.898 --> 29:37.071
It's all in the past now.

29:37.234 --> 29:39.862
I've been dealing with a lot more
since then.

29:39.987 --> 29:41.330
Anything I can do?

29:42.447 --> 29:43.744
I Wish. I--

29:43.907 --> 29:46.535
The only thing
that could help me now is--

29:50.789 --> 29:52.791
Will you marry me?

30:03.719 --> 30:05.266
Really?

30:05.429 --> 30:07.181
Under the Jumbotron?

30:07.347 --> 30:10.476
- A little theatrical, don't you think?
- Where is it?

30:10.600 --> 30:14.730
You mean your evidence
against Oscar? Did you need that?

30:14.896 --> 30:17.194
I need you to give it to me.

30:18.066 --> 30:20.194
I wish you'd asked me sooner.

30:20.360 --> 30:22.863
I don't have it anymore.
I gave it away.

30:23.655 --> 30:25.202
You--

30:25.407 --> 30:29.207
You-- You stupid girl.

30:29.328 --> 30:31.001
Do you realise what you've done?

30:34.333 --> 30:36.677
Actually, I do.

30:55.812 --> 30:57.985
Aren't you supposed to be meeting
someone?

30:59.358 --> 31:00.905
Icancefled.

32:10.887 --> 32:12.685
Hey, Derek.

32:13.598 --> 32:16.101
Hey, Ahsha around?

32:17.269 --> 32:21.319
Actually, she's not.

32:21.440 --> 32:24.319
I sent you that text.
I wanted to make sure you'd come.

32:24.443 --> 32:26.992
Ahsha's at the arena
working on her choreography.

32:27.112 --> 32:28.455
That gives us time alone.

32:30.949 --> 32:33.122
Alone for what?

32:34.661 --> 32:37.039
I like you, Derek.

32:37.664 --> 32:39.962
I can't do what Oscar's
asked me to do.

32:40.125 --> 32:41.843
What did Oscar ask you to do?

32:42.669 --> 32:44.012
Make a movie.

32:44.171 --> 32:46.720
Starring you, me and a straw.

32:46.882 --> 32:49.761
You have contract negotiations
coming up.

32:50.010 --> 32:52.263
He wants to make sure you stay put.

32:52.429 --> 32:54.602
- That's crazy.
- That's Oscar.

32:55.515 --> 32:57.984
- I'm gonna go talk to him.
- I didn't tell you

32:58.101 --> 32:59.728
so you can go blabbing to him.

32:59.895 --> 33:01.863
It wouldn't make a difference
anyway.

33:01.980 --> 33:04.779
If Oscar wants something from you,
he'll get it.

33:05.609 --> 33:08.408
You got yourself a problem,
Derek Roman.

33:08.528 --> 33:10.201
You're on Oscar Kinkade's radar.

33:10.655 --> 33:14.330
And so am I. He's testing me,
and I can't afford to fail.

33:15.160 --> 33:18.004
Look, I got a lot
on my plate right now.

33:18.163 --> 33:21.292
- I'm cool if I just keep my hands clean.
- But they're not.

33:25.045 --> 33:28.345
This isn't the first time
someone's tried to blackmail you.

33:32.052 --> 33:33.770
Olivia.

33:34.221 --> 33:35.518
I was in her house.

33:35.680 --> 33:38.183
I saw your name
on the same red envelope I got.

33:38.350 --> 33:40.352
I'm guessing
whatever Olivia had on you

33:40.477 --> 33:42.571
didn't go away
just because she did.

33:43.855 --> 33:46.904
If I help you get around this tape,
maybe there's something

33:47.067 --> 33:49.069
- you could help me with.
- What?

33:49.778 --> 33:52.247
I don't have an alibi
for the night she died.

33:53.532 --> 33:55.000
Now you do.

33:57.077 --> 34:00.172
I have a plan that will get Oscar
off both of our backs.

34:00.956 --> 34:03.630
But it means one of us
will have to leave L.A.

34:05.418 --> 34:08.672
That evidence proved Oscar
had Mia killed.

34:09.297 --> 34:13.177
You'd rather profit off her death
than see him pay for what he did?

34:13.301 --> 34:16.429
You were digging into Oscar
the entire time.

34:16.721 --> 34:18.849
You had some
other reason for being here.

34:18.974 --> 34:21.818
It certainly wasn't talent
or knack for the job.

34:23.061 --> 34:25.655
\Tell me you did not give it to Oscar.

34:26.982 --> 34:28.984
Oh, honey.

34:29.442 --> 34:32.161
Months of sneaking around,
and look at you.

34:32.654 --> 34:33.996
You're spun out.

34:34.114 --> 34:37.744
Never should've started playing
this game if you couldn't stomach it.

34:37.909 --> 34:39.831
This is not a game, Jelena.

34:39.995 --> 34:42.248
You're playing with people's lives.

34:44.666 --> 34:47.385
Who did you give it to?

34:53.632 --> 34:54.976
Lionel.

34:57.345 --> 34:59.848
You predicted
my movie would bomb.

35:00.015 --> 35:01.767
And it did.

35:01.933 --> 35:05.858
So I'm gonna make
a little prediction for you.

35:12.527 --> 35:14.325
Thirty years.

35:14.487 --> 35:15.989
Three sentences.

35:16.156 --> 35:17.783
Consecutive.

35:18.658 --> 35:21.753
And that will just be
for that poor dancer's death.

35:21.911 --> 35:25.165
Never mind the cover-up.
Or the fraud.

35:28.918 --> 35:32.343
I knew someone was poking
into my business.

35:33.506 --> 35:35.133
You, I was not expecting.

35:40.013 --> 35:42.357
You need to be a betterjudge
of character.

35:44.893 --> 35:48.648
There's more going on
under your nose than you realise.

35:50.398 --> 35:52.901
Oscar, you have a problem.

35:53.818 --> 35:55.536
As luck would have it,

35:55.695 --> 35:57.368
I have the exact same problem.

35:58.365 --> 36:02.620
And together,
we're gonna make it go away.

36:08.375 --> 36:10.548
"I don't have a son."

36:12.087 --> 36:14.681
That's how he said it. Just like that.

36:16.216 --> 36:18.059
Like nothing.

36:19.135 --> 36:21.729
I keep reaching out to people.

36:22.013 --> 36:25.233
To you, Oscar.

36:27.102 --> 36:30.697
Just once

36:31.272 --> 36:33.775
I want someone to reach back.

36:56.381 --> 36:59.305
You heard my conversation with Derek
about the coke.

37:00.927 --> 37:03.771
You could have used it to hurt him,
but you didn't.

37:04.180 --> 37:05.682
Because it would hurt me.

37:07.016 --> 37:09.110
Don't make a thing out of it.

37:12.397 --> 37:14.616
My folks gave me up

37:15.150 --> 37:18.529
to foster parents who collected kids
to collect the cheques.

37:19.112 --> 37:20.955
You think I came up with Zero?

37:21.948 --> 37:23.916
That's what they called me.

37:24.075 --> 37:25.827
Zero.

37:26.494 --> 37:28.246
I kept it.

37:28.580 --> 37:31.675
I showed them
how big Zero could be.

37:33.835 --> 37:35.178
What's your real name?

37:36.671 --> 37:38.469
I'm telling you this for a reason.

37:38.590 --> 37:41.309
Just because people
are supposed to care about you

37:41.426 --> 37:43.303
doesn't mean that they will.

37:44.179 --> 37:48.685
The sooner you forget about Oscar,
the better-off you'll be.

37:53.480 --> 37:56.825
You have no idea
what I've done for that man.

38:48.409 --> 38:50.662
<i>Next on the season finale
of Hit the Floor:</i>

38:50.829 --> 38:53.582
The cop asked me.
I said I was with you.

38:53.706 --> 38:56.004
Where were you
the night she was murdered?

38:56.167 --> 38:57.885
What you care about is the win.

38:58.002 --> 39:00.175
If you want your life back,
you need MVP.

39:00.338 --> 39:05.344
I hope that whoever did kill Olivia,
the punishment fits the crime.

39:06.010 --> 39:08.638
I was wondering,
tell me where you were at 10:26.

39:08.972 --> 39:11.066
You making an arrest?

39:12.475 --> 39:14.694
I'll explain. I'll explain everything.
