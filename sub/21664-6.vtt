18:35.264 --> 18:36.797
why you wanted to
come to this sleepover.

18:36.897 --> 18:38.631
- Uh, Frankie's turn.

18:38.731 --> 18:40.697
- Oh, but you didn't
answer my question.

18:40.797 --> 18:43.964

rude to our host.

18:44.064 --> 18:47.264

18:47.364 --> 18:49.097

18:49.197 --> 18:51.131
You know, asparagus
calms the nerves.

18:51.231 --> 18:53.197
- How can you be
so relaxed?

18:53.297 --> 18:55.631
- Maybe it's
my asparagus smoothie.

18:55.731 --> 18:58.097

Truth Or Dare, Will.

18:58.197 --> 19:00.097

19:09.831 --> 19:11.064
Do tell.

19:11.164 --> 19:13.531
- She's asking Frankie
about that Cole character.

19:13.631 --> 19:14.964
- [laughs]
Cole's the man.

19:15.064 --> 19:16.764

even know Cole.

19:16.864 --> 19:19.331

she hugged him?

19:19.431 --> 19:20.397
