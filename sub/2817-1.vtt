<i>That party we just threw,
there were over a thousand people there, bro.</i>

00:37.289 --> 00:40.584
No, way. Oh, my God
I can't wait to get up there.

00:40.667 --> 00:42.335
<i>Yeah. You know I'm hooking you up, too.</i>

00:42.460 --> 00:43.628
<i>Just help me move a little bit of candy,</i>

00:43.712 --> 00:46.506
<i>I will put some serious
paper in your pocket, man.</i>

00:46.631 --> 00:47.674
<i>Oh, speaking of, I need a solid,</i>

00:47.799 --> 00:51.219
<i>I'm bringing in about two boats
to unload over the holiday break.</i>

00:51.303 --> 00:53.638
Two boats, man,
that's like two thousand pills.

00:53.722 --> 00:57.183
<i>Okay, another seven Gs
is what it is, all right?</i>

00:57.309 --> 00:59.561
<i>And some of that could be yours.</i>

00:59.644 --> 01:00.645
No, I'm good, man.

01:00.729 --> 01:02.939
<i>Look, man, you don't got to do anything.</i>

01:03.023 --> 01:05.191
<i>I just gotta ship the box to your house, okay?</i>

01:05.567 --> 01:08.695
<i>I can't fly with this stuff.</i>

01:08.820 --> 01:09.988
- I don't know, bro.

01:10.071 --> 01:12.574
<i>Come on, it's for like a day until I get there.</i>

01:12.657 --> 01:14.868
<i>You can even... You can even have some.</i>

01:14.993 --> 01:17.579
<i>I know you said Amanda was dying to roll.</i>

01:17.662 --> 01:18.663
I'll talk to you later about it, all right.

01:18.788 --> 01:21.429
<i>- No, look, I'll text you the tracking number.</i>
- No, no, no, don't.

01:21.666 --> 01:22.709
Hey,

01:23.168 --> 01:24.127
why don't you answer the phone?

01:24.210 --> 01:25.337
I was Skyping with Craig.

01:25.503 --> 01:27.088
- Jason.
- Sorry.

01:27.172 --> 01:29.507
Hello. Hi, Maggie.

01:29.633 --> 01:33.845
No, no, Nick said that the layoffs
weren't happening in our division.

01:47.067 --> 01:48.568
Mike, I understand, but the bottom line is

01:48.693 --> 01:50.528
I need to buy all four rigs.

01:50.654 --> 01:52.572
Anything less than that, there's no point.

01:52.697 --> 01:55.200
I may as well just keep leasing.

01:55.367 --> 01:56.407
Well, that's what they do.

01:56.534 --> 01:58.703
Those haulers, they get together once a year,

01:58.912 --> 02:01.831
then they raise the rates before the gas prices.

02:01.915 --> 02:04.793
They do because they know
they can get away with it.

02:08.045 --> 02:09.047
See the contract?

02:09.130 --> 02:11.758
Yeah, it's real.
I just don't know when it's going to start.

02:12.550 --> 02:15.387
How much money
am I going to have to borrow?

02:18.223 --> 02:20.225
All right, let's move some equity around.

02:22.560 --> 02:25.605
I've been rolling the dice my whole life,
might as well do it again.

02:25.730 --> 02:26.898
I gotta go.

02:28.817 --> 02:30.110
Solid week, boys, thank you.

02:30.235 --> 02:32.715
Figured Analisa would have you
putting up ribbons and balloons.

02:32.737 --> 02:34.948
Oh, I'm still out getting Izzyâ€™s cake.

02:35.073 --> 02:36.032
Good luck with that.

02:36.116 --> 02:37.636
I need it, have a good weekend, Wayne.

02:37.659 --> 02:38.743
See you.

03:04.269 --> 03:06.312
You know there's no O.T.
unless it's authorized.

03:06.438 --> 03:09.524
Not looking for O.T., sir,
it's got a broken pallet,

03:09.607 --> 03:10.650
I'm getting my bags out of the weather,

03:10.734 --> 03:11.815
it's going to rain tonight.

03:15.113 --> 03:16.114
Good heads up.

03:22.162 --> 03:23.538
Oh, sir, I got this, seriously,

03:23.621 --> 03:24.622
I don't want you to get dirty.

03:24.706 --> 03:26.708
It's all right. Let's do it together.

03:29.210 --> 03:30.211
I'm John Matthews.

03:31.004 --> 03:32.130
Daniel James.

03:33.631 --> 03:35.633
Good to meet you, Daniel.

03:35.967 --> 03:37.343
Don't worry about it.

03:37.469 --> 03:39.929
How long you been working here?

03:40.013 --> 03:44.184
You mean working for you?
About three weeks now.

03:44.309 --> 03:45.810
Why, you thinkin'
about givin' me that raise already?

03:46.311 --> 03:47.937
- Fat chance, buddy.

03:48.021 --> 03:49.981
- You gotta try, right?
- Gotta give it a whirl.

04:18.051 --> 04:19.451
I have a package for Jason Collins.

04:19.511 --> 04:20.512
Uh, yeah, that's me.

04:20.595 --> 04:22.972
All right, sign right there.

04:23.056 --> 04:24.099
All right, thanks.

04:28.937 --> 04:30.021
Have a good one.

04:30.105 --> 04:31.189
Thanks, man.

05:08.017 --> 05:09.394
Search warrant! DEA!

05:09.477 --> 05:10.877
- Open the door.

05:10.895 --> 05:13.106
- DEA!

05:18.820 --> 05:20.446
Runner, back fence!

06:01.279 --> 06:02.280
Freeze!

06:02.363 --> 06:03.364
Get down!

06:03.448 --> 06:05.200
Get on the ground!

06:27.305 --> 06:28.306
Cupcakes.

06:29.724 --> 06:33.144
Oh, thank you,
that looks so good.

06:35.146 --> 06:36.189
I love you.

06:37.815 --> 06:38.900
Hi, baby.

06:38.983 --> 06:40.109
You having fun on your birthday, Izzy?

06:40.193 --> 06:41.653
Mmm-hmm.

06:47.825 --> 06:52.538
Hey, Sylvie, hey let me
call you back. I'm... What?

07:07.220 --> 07:08.304
They tell you anything?

07:08.471 --> 07:11.849
Just to wait here until we're called.

07:13.476 --> 07:16.036
They're treating him like he's
some kind of major criminal, John.

07:18.189 --> 07:20.858
All right, we'll straighten it out.

07:21.025 --> 07:23.444
Is he under my last name or yours?

07:23.528 --> 07:25.822
You know he changed it to mine.

07:25.905 --> 07:27.365
Why are you even asking?

07:37.250 --> 07:38.490
Hi, my son, Jason Collins is...

07:38.501 --> 07:40.586
Take a seat and wait to be called.

07:40.878 --> 07:42.358
Can you at least tell me where he is?

08:04.402 --> 08:05.842
Have you noticed anything different?

08:06.738 --> 08:07.739
Like what?

08:08.239 --> 08:09.741
With him, who he's been hanging with,

08:09.866 --> 08:11.026
anything out of the ordinary.

08:11.576 --> 08:14.454
No, John, I haven't noticed anything.

08:14.620 --> 08:16.914
Oh, this is such bullshit.

08:17.081 --> 08:20.084
I mean, he is a good kid.

08:20.918 --> 08:22.211
Mike's sending a lawyer.

08:23.046 --> 08:25.256
Good, you can afford it.

08:30.053 --> 08:31.054
Didn't you quit?

08:43.066 --> 08:44.107
Mr. and Mrs. Matthews?

08:44.776 --> 08:46.611
Yeah, thanks for coming.

08:47.320 --> 08:48.321
Where's Jason?

08:48.446 --> 08:51.282
They're moving him
from his holding cell to a courtroom.

08:51.407 --> 08:53.127
He's scheduled to be arraigned this evening

08:53.159 --> 08:54.160
that could take a little while.

08:54.243 --> 08:55.703
That's all right, leave him in jail for a little bit,

08:55.787 --> 08:56.954
scare the hell out of him.

08:57.789 --> 08:59.791
No one's trying to scare your son.

08:59.957 --> 09:01.292
This is a federal case.

09:01.417 --> 09:03.878
The amount of MDMA, or Ecstasy, they found

09:03.961 --> 09:07.006
means they've charged Jason with
distribution of narcotics.

09:07.423 --> 09:10.510
Jason said that a friend asked
to have the drugs sent to the house.

09:10.635 --> 09:11.636
What friend?

09:11.928 --> 09:13.638
A friend by the name of Craig Johnson.

09:13.805 --> 09:15.348
That's his best friend.

09:15.431 --> 09:17.558
Christ, I have known Craig since he was little.

09:17.642 --> 09:20.978
Mr. Johnson was arrested
trying to mail the pills

09:21.145 --> 09:23.689
and he agreed to work with the government.

09:23.815 --> 09:25.935
What do you mean "agreed
to work with the government"?

09:26.150 --> 09:28.111
Both Craig and Jason are being charged

09:28.194 --> 09:30.196
under federal mandatory
minimum sentencing laws.

09:30.321 --> 09:32.573
These laws were designed
to ensnare high-level

09:32.657 --> 09:35.118
drug traffickers to get them
to snitch on other traffickers

09:35.284 --> 09:37.495
in order to reduce their own sentence.
However,

09:37.662 --> 09:39.956
most of the convictions,

09:40.039 --> 09:42.333
over half have been first-time offenders
like your son.

09:42.667 --> 09:44.335
So Craig is implicating Jason.

09:44.502 --> 09:45.982
Yes. In order to reduce his sentence,

09:46.045 --> 09:47.338
Craig told the DEA

09:47.463 --> 09:50.591
that Jason agreed to have
the pills sent to the house

09:50.675 --> 09:53.177
- and also has agreed to help sell them.
- What?

09:53.678 --> 09:55.721
Now, Jason has denied
both of these accusations.

09:55.847 --> 09:57.473
- Do you believe him?
- Of course I believe him.

09:57.557 --> 09:59.559
He would never be involved
in anything like this.

10:01.561 --> 10:04.981
Are we talking about probation here
or could he actually go to jail for this?

10:05.064 --> 10:07.608
The mandatory minimum laws are very simple.

10:07.692 --> 10:10.236
The amount of jail time
depends upon the amount of drugs.

10:10.361 --> 10:11.641
There are no mitigating factors.

10:11.696 --> 10:12.655
What does that mean?

10:12.738 --> 10:14.458
Jason is facing
a mandatory minimum sentence

10:14.532 --> 10:16.284
- of ten years in prison.
- Ten years?

10:16.367 --> 10:17.577
Are you out of your mind?

10:17.910 --> 10:20.371
He just got accepted to college.

10:20.496 --> 10:22.081
John, tell him.

10:29.922 --> 10:31.007
Oh, God.

10:49.108 --> 10:50.109
Jason.

10:56.407 --> 10:59.452
<i>United States v. Jason Collins.</i>

11:03.247 --> 11:04.767
How could they deny him bail?

11:04.874 --> 11:06.918
He's never even been arrested before.

11:09.629 --> 11:11.047
You want to know the truth?

11:11.130 --> 11:12.715
I knew something like this was gonna happen.

11:12.798 --> 11:15.760
I figured if I just got him off to college,
but no.

11:15.885 --> 11:18.638
Jason has no goddamn idea
what real responsibility means.

11:18.763 --> 11:20.973
Especially with Sylvie
babying him all the time.

11:21.057 --> 11:22.016
And when your own son

11:22.099 --> 11:23.643
doesn't want to have anything
to do with you anymore...

11:23.726 --> 11:24.727
- That's not true.
- That's not true.

11:24.810 --> 11:25.937
That's not true at all.

11:26.062 --> 11:28.898
It's just really hard for kids
who go through divorces.

11:28.981 --> 11:31.484
It was... I acted out when my father left.

11:31.609 --> 11:34.070
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, well,
he's not a kid anymore.

11:34.153 --> 11:35.738
Not while he's sitting in that cell.

11:37.573 --> 11:39.200
Are the sprinklers on?

11:39.283 --> 11:40.683
Does everything have to go to shit?

11:58.469 --> 11:59.989
Here's the situation.
It's very simple.

12:00.263 --> 12:02.682
You help them make
trafficking arrests, and they will

12:02.807 --> 12:06.644
reduce your sentence
from 10 years to two. One suspended.

12:08.020 --> 12:10.273
I told you, I don't know anyone else.
Just Craig.

12:10.648 --> 12:11.649
Bullshit.

12:12.650 --> 12:14.986
Your mom told me she smelled
marijuana on you before.

12:15.778 --> 12:17.018
Where'd you get that from, huh?

12:17.446 --> 12:18.656
Jason, this is serious.

12:19.782 --> 12:22.368
Come on, honey,
you gotta tell us who sold you the pot.

12:23.494 --> 12:26.831
I didn't... I didn't have to buy it.

12:28.165 --> 12:30.835
Amanda's dad grows it.

12:30.960 --> 12:32.503
He has a medicinal license.

12:32.628 --> 12:34.630
It's legal. We just took some.

12:34.714 --> 12:36.632
I just wanted to try it.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.802
Okay, are there any
of your friends who

12:39.885 --> 12:41.971
do drugs who might be interested in selling?

12:43.180 --> 12:48.060
What, like setting someone up?
Like Craig did to me?

12:50.813 --> 12:53.482
No way. No way.

12:54.233 --> 12:55.234
You better wake up.

12:55.818 --> 12:58.529
You better wake up right now
'cause this is really happening.

12:59.196 --> 13:02.533
You're gonna take that plea,
and you're gonna help them make the arrest.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.327
You hear me?

13:05.202 --> 13:06.996
I'll take my chances in court.

13:07.538 --> 13:09.123
No, you won't. No, you won't.

13:09.206 --> 13:10.416
You do not work with the prosecutors,

13:10.541 --> 13:14.086
and they can raise the minimum
limit to 30 years.

13:14.211 --> 13:15.211
Which means you'll be out

13:15.254 --> 13:16.339
in time for your 50th birthday.

13:16.422 --> 13:19.342
And they are batting over 90% on convictions.

13:19.425 --> 13:21.886
Oh, God, Jason, baby,
please, listen to him.

13:22.720 --> 13:23.888
We don't have another choice.

13:27.099 --> 13:28.434
I'm not setting anyone up.

13:28.684 --> 13:29.644
Baby, please.

13:29.727 --> 13:31.228
I'm not doing it. I won't do it.

13:31.354 --> 13:32.396
Yes, you are.

13:34.565 --> 13:36.126
- Listen to me, damn it!

13:38.235 --> 13:40.321
You think you know what you're doing?

13:40.404 --> 13:41.822
You have no idea until you spend

13:41.906 --> 13:44.075
the next 10 years of your life in prison.

13:46.577 --> 13:48.120
I'm not gonna let that happen to you, son.

13:48.245 --> 13:49.205
You hear me?

13:49.288 --> 13:51.207
You're not the one who'd have to do it.

14:19.985 --> 14:21.237
Morning, John, hey,

14:21.320 --> 14:23.948
I need to show you something. This is, uh...

14:27.451 --> 14:29.829
Well, they're beauts, ain't they?

14:29.954 --> 14:31.997
They said the other two
will be ready next month.

14:32.123 --> 14:34.125
Yeah, they're great. I gotta make a call.

14:40.965 --> 14:45.761
Terry. John Matthews. Good.

14:46.929 --> 14:48.472
No, we definitely gotta get out.

14:48.597 --> 14:49.974
We'll hit a few. Very soon.

14:50.057 --> 14:51.600
Hey, let me ask you something.

14:51.684 --> 14:55.020
Do you have a connection
to Joanne Keeghan?

14:55.146 --> 14:56.313
The U.S. Attorney downtown?

15:08.367 --> 15:09.928
Go ahead and have a seat.

15:19.044 --> 15:22.423
Mr. Matthews.
You have a lot of friends in this city.

15:22.506 --> 15:25.301
I received four phone calls
in the matter of an hour.

15:25.426 --> 15:27.066
I'm sure you'd do the same for your kids.

15:27.178 --> 15:28.304
I don't have any children.

15:29.138 --> 15:30.848
All right, well, let's see.

15:32.099 --> 15:33.768
Eighteen years old.

15:33.851 --> 15:36.270
Well, you must have had him
when you were quite young.

15:36.896 --> 15:38.147
Sophomore in college.

15:38.230 --> 15:39.950
Me and his mom
were high school sweethearts.

15:40.024 --> 15:42.943
Well, you have my sympathies.

15:43.027 --> 15:48.073
But I believe in the mandatory minimum laws.

15:48.157 --> 15:49.867
We're fighting
a war right now not just on drugs,

15:49.950 --> 15:51.410
but on the violence they bring.

15:51.494 --> 15:52.995
And we are losing badly,

15:53.078 --> 15:55.623
so it's time for all our sakes
we have to turn this around.

15:56.165 --> 15:57.666
Miss Keeghan, I agree. I do.

15:57.750 --> 16:00.085
But my son, Jason, he's not a drug dealer.

16:00.169 --> 16:01.253
He's a good kid,

16:01.337 --> 16:04.173
and he just made
a really dumb, naive mistake.

16:04.632 --> 16:07.468
And he's willing to do anything he can
to help out his situation.

16:07.676 --> 16:10.971
But the only drug dealer
that he knows is Craig Johnson

16:11.055 --> 16:12.807
who you already have in custody.

16:13.057 --> 16:14.058
Hmm.

16:15.017 --> 16:19.021
Well, I'm really sorry to hear that.

16:19.605 --> 16:21.774
Please, there's gotta be something I can do.

16:21.941 --> 16:23.901
Well, now the laws are designed

16:23.984 --> 16:25.778
to preclude any special circumstances

16:25.861 --> 16:26.987
so it's really quite simple.

16:27.071 --> 16:28.906
We need your son to help us make arrests

16:28.989 --> 16:30.991
before we can help him reduce his sentence.

16:31.200 --> 16:33.786
If he can't do that or isn't willing to do that,

16:33.869 --> 16:35.579
then there's

16:35.663 --> 16:38.040
really nothing we can do. I'm sorry.

16:38.207 --> 16:39.750
And now, um,

16:40.167 --> 16:41.919
I have to be somewhere else.

16:43.754 --> 16:45.631
- What if I did it for him?
- What?

16:45.714 --> 16:47.466
What if I helped you make arrests?

16:48.759 --> 16:50.344
It's not the way it works.

16:50.761 --> 16:52.930
Please. I just want to help my son.

16:53.681 --> 16:56.433
I understand. And I really am sorry,

16:57.893 --> 16:59.311
but my hands are tied.

16:59.395 --> 17:00.688
There's nothing I can do.

17:01.188 --> 17:02.648
Thank you for stopping by.

17:26.171 --> 17:27.172
How you doing?

17:27.548 --> 17:29.341
Hi. Who are you here to see?

17:29.758 --> 17:30.759
Jason Collins.

17:31.552 --> 17:32.803
Okay. Just sign in.

17:37.224 --> 17:38.225
Proceed to booth 3.

17:38.976 --> 17:40.019
Thank you.

17:52.615 --> 17:54.255
Got your punk ass in here, too.

17:58.287 --> 17:59.413
Yeah, I see him.

18:10.799 --> 18:11.800
What happened?

18:14.595 --> 18:15.596
Nothing.

18:17.640 --> 18:19.391
Tell me. It's okay.

18:24.271 --> 18:25.564
Talk to me, son.

18:26.482 --> 18:28.484
It's okay. Tell me.

18:32.863 --> 18:35.908
Remember when someone kept
teepeeing and egging your house?

18:37.284 --> 18:38.494
That was me.

18:41.080 --> 18:43.123
I would sit around the corner and laugh

18:43.207 --> 18:45.084
and watch you try and clean it off.

18:47.086 --> 18:49.129
Doesn't matter now, Jason.

18:50.756 --> 18:52.466
The last time I did it,

18:53.509 --> 18:55.010
I didn't know you were out of town.

18:58.722 --> 19:02.142
I felt like crap watching
Analisa just do it herself.

19:03.686 --> 19:05.688
So I pretended I was just stopping by.

19:06.397 --> 19:07.648
I helped her.

19:09.233 --> 19:10.234
She told me.

19:12.653 --> 19:16.365
I hated that you got to
live in that big house. New family.

19:16.865 --> 19:19.410
Me and Mom were just stuck in that old one.

19:22.746 --> 19:24.373
I wanted you to live with me.

19:25.666 --> 19:27.918
I wanted you in my life.

19:30.462 --> 19:31.672
It was my fault.

19:32.339 --> 19:33.841
Not yours.

19:35.342 --> 19:37.845
I was always gone.
I was always on those trucks.

19:38.053 --> 19:39.346
I was always working.

19:40.347 --> 19:43.809
I got so caught up in
not failing you as a father,

19:45.352 --> 19:47.187
that's exactly what I did.

19:54.445 --> 19:56.196
I should've never taken that package.

19:56.822 --> 19:58.032
I knew what was in it.

19:59.158 --> 20:01.994
I should've just told the guy
he had the wrong address.

20:02.077 --> 20:03.537
But I didn't.

20:03.620 --> 20:06.165
Because me and Amanda wanted to try some.

20:07.416 --> 20:09.835
But I swear to you, Dad, I would never ever.

20:09.918 --> 20:13.130
I wasn't planning on helping to sell that stuff.

20:14.590 --> 20:16.633
I'm not a drug dealer.

20:18.093 --> 20:19.094
You believe me, right?

20:20.054 --> 20:21.305
Of course I believe you.

20:22.890 --> 20:26.393
And I know I should be
punished for what I did.

20:27.686 --> 20:28.729
But not like this.

20:36.779 --> 20:39.698
Jason, don't cry.

20:39.782 --> 20:41.825
Don't cry, Jason. Not in here.

20:43.410 --> 20:46.497
Listen to me, Jason.

20:47.039 --> 20:49.666
You gotta show them
you're gonna stand up for yourself in here.

20:51.418 --> 20:52.836
You have to.

20:55.422 --> 20:57.216
I promise you I'm gonna get you out of here.

20:58.467 --> 20:59.468
How?

20:59.635 --> 21:02.054
You just gotta trust me.

21:05.432 --> 21:06.642
I love you.

23:24.571 --> 23:26.365
- What you want?
- Coke.

23:26.448 --> 23:27.449
Crack is whack, man.

23:27.532 --> 23:28.732
Who do you think we are, dude?

23:29.326 --> 23:30.526
I'll just go to somebody else.

23:35.832 --> 23:38.627
Look, man. If you real about it, money talks.

23:43.173 --> 23:44.174
Get off me!

23:50.472 --> 23:51.473
Get him, man.

23:56.770 --> 23:58.438
Hey, let's jack this bitch's ride, too!

23:58.563 --> 23:59.898
Here come the rollers!

24:05.946 --> 24:08.323
<i>We're gonna need additional backup.</i>

24:21.962 --> 24:23.630
<i>What the hell were you thinking?</i>

24:23.964 --> 24:26.165
I know. I'm sorry
I threw your name down at the station.

24:26.174 --> 24:28.468
Your son is not gonna be
better off if you're dead.

24:29.303 --> 24:31.596
Okay, well, clearly what I did
last night didn't work.

24:31.680 --> 24:32.889
Clearly.

24:32.973 --> 24:34.683
Please. What do I gotta do?

24:34.766 --> 24:37.519
You are so stubborn,
you're not gonna stop, are you?

24:37.602 --> 24:38.854
No. I'm not.

24:41.898 --> 24:44.568
All right, hypothetically,

24:44.735 --> 24:46.778
I would need an airtight arrest

24:46.862 --> 24:49.072
of someone in possession of
narcotics in the amount

24:49.156 --> 24:51.158
that would constitute
conspiracy to distribute.

24:51.283 --> 24:52.701
If we're talking cocaine,

24:52.784 --> 24:55.662
that would be at least 500 grams or half a kilo.

24:57.456 --> 24:58.582
What?

24:59.207 --> 25:00.334
I'm in the construction business.

25:00.417 --> 25:03.670
And we have ex cons
who are working the yard all the time.

25:03.754 --> 25:05.964
Maybe someone knows someone
who knows someone.

25:06.506 --> 25:08.759
You're their boss. Why would they trust you?

25:08.842 --> 25:09.968
Let me worry about that.

25:10.052 --> 25:14.056
Believe me, I am not worried
because the risk is all yours.

26:22.833 --> 26:24.033
Come on. I'll give you a lift.

26:24.543 --> 26:25.752
Thank you. But I'm good.

26:26.086 --> 26:27.963
Hey, I'm the boss. Get in.

26:39.141 --> 26:40.222
How's the job treating you?

26:40.892 --> 26:42.269
The fact that I got a job.

26:44.312 --> 26:46.898
Look, I guess I'm just
trying to say thank you.

26:46.982 --> 26:50.402
Me and my family,
we appreciate the opportunity, so...

26:51.403 --> 26:53.113
I mean, it's gotta be hard for a...

26:55.115 --> 26:56.283
Ex con.

26:56.825 --> 26:58.201
So that, that's why we're here?

26:59.244 --> 27:02.164
You need to talk to me
about my past? 'Cause look,

27:02.998 --> 27:04.708
I was completely honest on my application,

27:04.791 --> 27:05.792
but if there's anything else...

27:05.917 --> 27:08.587
No. That... That's not it.

27:13.216 --> 27:14.217
Okay.

27:23.101 --> 27:25.103
Couple of years ago,
I caught two of my drivers,

27:25.187 --> 27:27.939
they were transporting some stuff.

27:29.149 --> 27:31.026
They know that the cops rarely stop semis,

27:31.109 --> 27:32.110
and if they did,

27:32.194 --> 27:35.405
they sure as hell didn't
have time to search 'em.

27:38.700 --> 27:41.495
Anyway, that was small time.

27:43.288 --> 27:45.499
I was hoping that someone with a connection

27:45.624 --> 27:46.666
into that world...

27:46.750 --> 27:48.270
Are you accusing me of something, sir?

27:49.920 --> 27:51.171
You think I've done something?

27:51.254 --> 27:54.090
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

27:54.758 --> 27:55.800
With all due respect, sir,

27:55.884 --> 27:56.968
why don't you just go ahead and tell me

27:57.052 --> 27:58.373
what it is that you want from me?

28:02.557 --> 28:03.683
An introduction.

28:07.103 --> 28:08.424
Yeah, I can't help you with that.

28:15.779 --> 28:17.572
You get me in front of the right people,

28:17.656 --> 28:19.491
I give you five grand.

28:19.574 --> 28:20.909
Something good comes out of it,

28:20.992 --> 28:22.118
I'll give you another five. That's 10 Gs...

28:22.202 --> 28:24.496
You know, I can count, man, I can count.

28:26.373 --> 28:28.250
Like I said, I can't help you with that.

28:30.794 --> 28:31.795
Why not?

28:34.256 --> 28:35.257
You see,

28:35.340 --> 28:38.593
John, I'm in the middle of
trying to get my life in order, okay?

28:38.677 --> 28:41.429
And I'm doing that for my family.
That's why I work like I do.

28:41.513 --> 28:43.932
That's why I sweat my ass off
every day in that yard.

28:44.140 --> 28:47.102
This little conversation,
just this would,

28:47.185 --> 28:49.646
see, this could be seen as
conspiracy, all right?

28:50.647 --> 28:55.068
And that gets me 25...to life.

28:56.319 --> 28:57.320
I would...

28:58.613 --> 29:00.073
I'd appreciate it if maybe we just pretend

29:00.156 --> 29:02.200
that this never happened, okay?

29:02.284 --> 29:03.618
I'll see you at work, sir.

29:04.494 --> 29:05.495
I just need an introduction.

29:05.579 --> 29:08.832
I think you oughta go home,
and you oughta be happy for what you got.

29:08.915 --> 29:09.916
Thank you for the coffee.

29:16.506 --> 29:17.507
Daniel!

29:24.681 --> 29:25.807
20 grand.

29:28.184 --> 29:30.395
I'll double it because of the risk you're taking.

30:02.761 --> 30:04.054
So right there? That's where you're staying?

30:04.137 --> 30:05.138
Right up there.

30:05.221 --> 30:06.473
Anthony. Anthony.

30:06.556 --> 30:08.475
Why don't you go inside? Go on. Go inside.

30:08.558 --> 30:09.798
Come on, Dad. I'm just hanging.

30:09.851 --> 30:11.102
Go. Now.

30:11.645 --> 30:13.647
Go. Go on.

30:13.730 --> 30:15.148
Why you checkin' on peewee for?

30:22.739 --> 30:23.948
Hold up, man. Hold...

30:24.032 --> 30:25.325
Hold, hold, hold up.

30:26.868 --> 30:28.370
I don't care if y'all sling what you sling.

30:28.453 --> 30:30.580
Y'all smoke what you smoke.

30:30.664 --> 30:32.248
You can blow holes
in each other if that's what you want,

30:32.332 --> 30:33.375
but I'm gonna tell you right now,

30:33.458 --> 30:34.459
you're gonna stay away from my son,

30:34.542 --> 30:36.542
- you hear me? You hear me?
- All right. All right.

30:44.302 --> 30:46.429
What are you, stupid, Flaco?

30:46.513 --> 30:49.057
This guy's a shot caller
from the east side, ese.

30:55.313 --> 30:56.314
Hey.

30:57.315 --> 30:58.316
Dad, why did you...

30:58.400 --> 30:59.693
Anthony. Go play your game.

31:02.112 --> 31:03.113
All right, what happened?

31:03.196 --> 31:05.907
Nothing happened, V.
Just father and son stuff.

31:06.533 --> 31:07.534
Uh-huh.

31:10.203 --> 31:11.204
What are you doing?

31:12.163 --> 31:13.164
Going to work.

31:13.790 --> 31:14.791
What do you mean, work?

31:14.874 --> 31:17.544
Larry called,
told me I have to be there in an hour.

31:17.669 --> 31:18.712
Come on, V, he can't do that.

31:18.795 --> 31:21.047
He can't just call you 7:30 at night
and tell you to come to work.

31:21.131 --> 31:24.467
He can do whatever he wants, Daniel.
That is, if I want to keep my job.

31:31.349 --> 31:32.726
Look, I'm already late.

31:33.685 --> 31:35.478
There's food for both of you on the stove.

31:38.898 --> 31:40.483
<i>Lo siento. Lo siento.</i>

31:41.609 --> 31:42.652
What are you doing, babe?

31:42.736 --> 31:43.737
<i>Lo siento.</i>

31:46.072 --> 31:47.532
Listen, wait, wait, wait.

31:47.657 --> 31:51.661
Let me ask you something.
Let me run something by you.

31:52.662 --> 31:55.081
What if me and my little partner over there,

31:55.165 --> 31:58.626
before bed time, we cruise
to the office, huh? Hmm?

31:58.710 --> 32:02.714
We charm your guests. Fatten up them tips.

32:02.797 --> 32:04.883
Make it work for everybody,
you know what I'm saying?

32:06.176 --> 32:07.177
I'd like that.

32:08.094 --> 32:09.304
Yeah?

32:11.222 --> 32:12.223
Mmm.

32:14.434 --> 32:15.435
Okay, I have to go.

32:15.518 --> 32:17.604
Don't go to work. Don't go to work.

32:17.687 --> 32:20.857
- I love you.
- I love you. I love you.

32:25.236 --> 32:27.822
Hey, A, get on the couch, man.

32:31.242 --> 32:32.243
Sit down, bud.

32:36.122 --> 32:37.916
Why did we move here, man?

32:42.045 --> 32:45.215
We moved so you wouldn't
have to hang out with fools like that.

32:45.298 --> 32:47.842
That's why. Right?

32:49.260 --> 32:51.721
There ain't nobody else
to hang with around here.

32:51.805 --> 32:53.556
I want to go back to our old apartment.

32:53.681 --> 32:55.081
You know we can't, so don't say it.

32:55.975 --> 33:00.271
Look, man. I know it's hard.
And sometimes life is.

33:00.355 --> 33:03.483
But I promise you, one day,
we're gonna move somewhere,

33:03.566 --> 33:06.069
and you're gonna get real friends.

33:06.152 --> 33:08.446
A real friend.

33:08.530 --> 33:09.906
You ain't gotta prove nothing to him.

33:09.989 --> 33:11.407
You ain't gotta do nothing for him.

33:11.950 --> 33:16.955
But those punks out there,
man, you're better than that.

33:17.622 --> 33:19.749
Want me to tell you something else?

33:22.293 --> 33:26.297
You better than me, man.
You're so much better than me.

33:26.881 --> 33:28.341
- Hey.
- Yeah.

33:28.424 --> 33:30.051
What's a shark caller?

33:31.135 --> 33:32.136
Where'd you hear that?

33:35.098 --> 33:36.599
Don't worry about that.

33:40.103 --> 33:43.147
I love you, man. And I'm proud of you.

33:43.231 --> 33:44.816
You need to be smart.

33:45.525 --> 33:47.735
Go get your homework, man.
We're gonna bang it out.

34:34.449 --> 34:35.449
Just keep going, man.

34:35.533 --> 34:38.328
All the way to the end. Don't stop.

34:49.088 --> 34:50.797
- Right here?
- You're good.

34:55.929 --> 34:58.097
I need to go on alone first.

34:59.474 --> 35:01.142
This guy in here, Malik.

35:01.434 --> 35:03.019
If he sniffs you even a little bit full of shit,

35:03.102 --> 35:04.270
I'm gonna tell you right now, man,

35:04.354 --> 35:05.794
you're never gonna leave this block.

35:05.813 --> 35:06.898
That's a promise.

35:10.652 --> 35:11.736
All right.

35:57.198 --> 35:58.282
What up, Cruizer?

35:58.366 --> 35:59.492
What up, Malik?

35:59.659 --> 36:01.786
Been a little while since I seen yo ass.

36:02.161 --> 36:03.913
What house you was in last?

36:04.163 --> 36:05.957
I was up at Sandstone, man.

36:06.165 --> 36:07.166
That's right.

36:07.291 --> 36:09.092
It was cold as hell up there, wasn't it, cuz?

36:09.669 --> 36:10.920
That's the truth, man.

36:22.181 --> 36:23.474
Boy, me and ol' boy right here,

36:23.558 --> 36:25.226
we used to get it in.

36:25.309 --> 36:27.770
Movin' product like we was
the United Nations and shit.

36:29.230 --> 36:30.273
'Cause you know
when it comes to that paper...

36:30.356 --> 36:32.150
Only color that matters is green.

36:33.651 --> 36:34.777
So how long you been home, man?

36:34.861 --> 36:35.862
You just now come to see me?

36:35.945 --> 36:37.113
Come on, Malik.

36:37.196 --> 36:38.698
You know I can't be associating

36:38.781 --> 36:40.366
with no known-ass criminals now.

36:41.242 --> 36:44.078
I hear you. That's why I be in here.

36:44.537 --> 36:46.581
Two strikers like us, man,
we can't walk the street.

36:46.664 --> 36:47.665
No, man.

36:48.041 --> 36:51.002
It ain't safe.

36:51.085 --> 36:53.463
So I'm saying though,
you back in the game, right?

36:53.546 --> 36:55.131
How come you ain't cross town
with your homeys?

36:55.298 --> 36:57.884
Just can't have any of the old homeys
getting any bright ideas, man.

36:57.967 --> 37:01.054
I'm telling you, them days,
they over for me, Malik. That's it.

37:01.137 --> 37:02.972
Right here is a one timer.

37:04.891 --> 37:09.729
Real smart, cuz. Real smart.
Keep that bank to yourself.

37:32.627 --> 37:33.753
Yo, homey, kill the beat.

37:50.478 --> 37:51.479
I'm John Matthews.

37:56.234 --> 37:58.778
Now, see, that's the reaction
I was looking for, playa.

38:01.656 --> 38:03.991
Ain't never had no iron
in your grill before, huh?

38:08.204 --> 38:09.247
Now see,

38:09.664 --> 38:11.332
if you was the popo, then you'd be

38:11.415 --> 38:13.000
the biggest pussy pig I ever seen.

38:18.673 --> 38:21.968
Now let's have an honest conversation
as to why you in my crib.

38:37.233 --> 38:38.693
I don't have product

38:38.776 --> 38:40.278
or distribution.

38:42.238 --> 38:43.531
But I do know business.

38:45.408 --> 38:48.161
If anyone needed transportation,

38:48.244 --> 38:50.204
I could provide that with no risk.

38:50.288 --> 38:51.706
There's always risk.

38:52.165 --> 38:53.749
My way minimizes it.

38:54.750 --> 38:55.918
See, what I want to know is

38:56.002 --> 38:58.129
why a successful businessman like yourself

38:58.212 --> 38:59.630
want to take any risk at all.

39:04.343 --> 39:06.637
I'm in the construction business.

39:06.721 --> 39:08.764
The way the economy is today,
it's all gone to shit.

39:09.015 --> 39:12.226
And I don't see any chance of it coming back.

39:13.144 --> 39:16.105
And I'm willing to do whatever it takes
to keep my business afloat.

39:16.189 --> 39:18.566
I've worked too hard for too long.

39:22.195 --> 39:23.946
So how much weight can you move?

39:25.156 --> 39:29.368
My trucks, half a ton
without attracting attention.

39:29.577 --> 39:30.578
Half a ton?

39:31.871 --> 39:33.831
Man, if I was in the thousand-pound business,

39:33.915 --> 39:35.716
I wouldn't be sitting in this dump right now.

39:36.334 --> 39:39.003
All I'm saying is, whatever you want to move,

39:39.086 --> 39:40.588
it won't matter in my trucks.

39:40.755 --> 39:41.756
You know they weigh them trucks

39:41.839 --> 39:42.965
at the state lines though, right?

39:43.049 --> 39:44.258
How you gonna cover that?

39:45.384 --> 39:48.554
We offset the weight. Count's off all the time.

39:49.180 --> 39:50.848
The police get lucky,
they'll only get the driver.

39:50.973 --> 39:53.142
We won't be there
for the loading or unloading.

39:54.185 --> 39:55.978
Sound like he ready for the game.

39:57.480 --> 39:58.689
So what you talking, playa?

40:00.066 --> 40:01.150
15% wholesale.

40:01.275 --> 40:03.110
I don't give nobody over 10%.

40:04.528 --> 40:07.531
I know I got something to prove to you.

40:07.615 --> 40:11.494
If the first run goes good,
then we renegotiate.

40:13.162 --> 40:14.747
You gonna drive the first load.

40:18.751 --> 40:20.294
Everybody know what game Malik in.

40:21.420 --> 40:23.381
We need to see if you for real first.

40:24.465 --> 40:27.802
Then maybe,

40:27.885 --> 40:29.887
just maybe, we go back to talking.

40:33.766 --> 40:34.767
Done.

40:35.685 --> 40:37.046
Go and chill outside for a minute.

40:37.103 --> 40:39.188
Let me and my boy Cruizer here have a word.

40:54.662 --> 40:56.080
You gonna ride shotgun.

40:56.414 --> 40:58.666
No, no, no, no, Malik.
Maybe you misunderstood

40:58.749 --> 40:59.750
- why I'm here.
- Misunderstood?

40:59.834 --> 41:00.793
Yeah, maybe you misunderstood.

41:00.876 --> 41:02.003
I'm here for an introduction, Malik.

41:02.086 --> 41:03.170
Hell no, Cruizer.

41:03.587 --> 41:06.590
See you wouldn't be vouching for no fish
if we was back in the yard.

41:07.341 --> 41:08.592
You know how this work.

41:08.759 --> 41:10.386
We ain't talking no hold time, homey.

41:10.469 --> 41:11.470
We in the street!

41:12.179 --> 41:13.764
That's three strikes, bruh.

41:13.973 --> 41:15.266
And the third strike for me

41:15.349 --> 41:16.892
is the third strike for you, my man.

41:16.976 --> 41:19.312
So you better be
convincing me right now, or he's smoke.

41:19.395 --> 41:21.275
And we can act like
none of this never happened.

41:21.731 --> 41:23.065
It's your call, man.

41:25.568 --> 41:27.653
This first round, I'm gonna be going with you.

41:27.737 --> 41:29.947
But we do it my way. I say how it goes.

41:30.156 --> 41:32.156
- What do you mean?
- I wanna get paid today. Okay?

41:32.158 --> 41:34.243
So I don't know if we have to
go see your banker.

41:34.327 --> 41:35.453
I don't care, man, go rob a store.

41:35.536 --> 41:36.662
But I need to get paid.

41:36.746 --> 41:38.039
Don't worry. You'll get your 10 grand.

41:38.122 --> 41:39.522
No 10 grand, man. We said 20 grand.

41:39.582 --> 41:40.663
That's what you said to me.

41:40.666 --> 41:42.418
And then what? You skip town on me?

41:42.918 --> 41:44.086
With all the money?

41:44.211 --> 41:46.291
So you coming with me on
this first run, that's fine.

41:46.297 --> 41:49.175
The moment it's done,
you'll get your other 10. My word.

41:49.258 --> 41:51.177
Your word? Only reason this is going down

41:51.260 --> 41:52.780
is because I went on the line for you.

41:53.512 --> 41:56.057
Three days ago, man, I was working a job,
I was staying clean.

41:56.140 --> 41:58.620
I was doing everything I was supposed to do,
and now here I am.

41:58.851 --> 41:59.894
I'm back in.

42:00.478 --> 42:01.812
Think this is some kind of thrill for me?

42:01.896 --> 42:03.576
Would you just please take me to my money?

42:07.610 --> 42:09.653
Y'all checked him out with
them niggas in Sandstone.

42:09.737 --> 42:11.280
They sayin' Cruizer's solid.

42:11.364 --> 42:13.574
He's on the main line like he said.

42:13.657 --> 42:16.410
Soldiering up.
Putting in work like good wood should.

42:16.744 --> 42:18.954
Even had keys to the yard for a minute.

42:19.330 --> 42:20.748
That's the Cruizer I know.

42:21.624 --> 42:22.958
What about our other player?

42:23.167 --> 42:25.169
Bones say he live in the suburbs.

42:25.252 --> 42:28.672
Fat crib with a wife, little girl,

42:28.756 --> 42:30.508
he ain't 5-0, that's for sure.

42:31.175 --> 42:33.928
He better not be.

42:34.011 --> 42:35.846
Because he on us with El Topo.

42:36.931 --> 42:39.809
No, the new TV spots
are testing really well with your core.

42:39.892 --> 42:41.852
Then why am I down by five points?

42:41.936 --> 42:44.105
Because the liberals think you're a bitch.

42:44.188 --> 42:46.065
Oh, maybe I should go to a gay wedding.

42:46.357 --> 42:47.637
- It wouldn't hurt.
- Oh, please.

42:47.691 --> 42:49.944
Listen, we had
900 convictions last year alone.

42:50.027 --> 42:52.279
They speak volumes to our core, right?

42:52.363 --> 42:54.532
But to win this primary,
the key to this primary

42:54.615 --> 42:55.895
is getting some crossover votes.

42:56.075 --> 42:57.618
Your next meeting
is checking in down in security.

42:57.701 --> 42:59.161
- Who is it?
- John Matthews.

42:59.245 --> 43:00.538
Ugh. I'll need a coffee.

43:02.540 --> 43:03.901
Let's go over her press schedules.

43:04.792 --> 43:06.544
<i>Man, if I was in a thousand-pound business,</i>

43:06.627 --> 43:08.428
<i>I wouldn't be sitting in this dump right now.</i>

43:08.712 --> 43:10.798
<i>All I'm saying is, whatever you want to move,</i>

43:10.881 --> 43:12.425
<i>it won't matter in my trucks.</i>

43:12.508 --> 43:14.176
So I looked at it as a business thing.

43:14.260 --> 43:15.845
What do I have that they want?

43:16.470 --> 43:18.264
I'm impressed. You're a natural.

43:18.848 --> 43:20.488
You're lucky he didn't rip you open, man.

43:21.308 --> 43:23.227
He's a heavy hitter.

43:23.853 --> 43:25.855
Runs the entire Adams district now.

43:26.063 --> 43:27.064
What's his jacket?

43:27.273 --> 43:29.191
He earned his stripes on the corner

43:29.275 --> 43:32.027
as a punk ass kid, did a nickel for ADW.

43:32.194 --> 43:33.487
Three more for distribution.

43:34.071 --> 43:36.615
Rivals robbed his bank last year.

43:36.699 --> 43:40.286
Instead of sending out
his posse to do a drive by,

43:40.369 --> 43:41.412
he tracked them each down

43:41.495 --> 43:42.935
and bled them out with a buck knife.

43:43.539 --> 43:44.623
Personally.

43:48.544 --> 43:51.088
All right. I'm signing off.

43:51.172 --> 43:54.842
Cooper is my witness.
We arrest Mr. Anderson,

43:54.925 --> 43:57.261
and I will reduce Jake's sentence.

43:57.845 --> 43:58.846
Jason.

43:59.763 --> 44:01.640
Right, sorry, Jason's sentence.

44:01.724 --> 44:03.058
By how much?

44:03.225 --> 44:04.393
I'll cut it to a year.

44:04.518 --> 44:07.771
Come on, I can't
let him get off soot-free.

44:07.855 --> 44:10.065
And with the time that he's already served,

44:10.149 --> 44:12.776
Jason will probably be out in six months.

44:13.235 --> 44:15.029
That is the best that I can do.

44:17.323 --> 44:18.866
- Okay.
- All right.

44:19.450 --> 44:20.868
Rock and roll.

44:26.916 --> 44:28.125
Is she going to keep her word?

44:29.835 --> 44:31.378
Don't give her a reason not to.

44:57.947 --> 44:59.740
- I like stuffing.
- Ooh!

44:59.823 --> 45:00.824
Hi, Daddy.

45:01.242 --> 45:02.243
Hey, honey.

45:03.661 --> 45:04.941
How long are you going away for?

45:05.871 --> 45:07.331
Just two days. That's it.

45:08.624 --> 45:11.752
Do you know how much I love you,
Miss Izzy? All right.

45:11.835 --> 45:12.836
Come here.

45:15.548 --> 45:16.828
Are you sure you have to go now?

45:16.966 --> 45:18.842
You know, with everything
going on with Jason?

45:18.926 --> 45:20.469
Yeah, we need the contract.

45:20.553 --> 45:22.313
Especially after those new trucks we bought.

45:22.846 --> 45:24.974
Come on, Iz. Let's go. We gotta go to school.

45:25.432 --> 45:28.519
I want you to finish. Have your toast.

45:45.160 --> 45:46.161
- Hey.
- Hey.

45:46.245 --> 45:47.746
You getting ready to go out
on one of those trucks?

45:47.830 --> 45:48.831
Yeah.

45:49.707 --> 45:50.749
How long you going for?

45:50.916 --> 45:53.117
Shit, I don't even know where
we're going to.

45:53.836 --> 45:57.298
It's a good thing your boss is giving you
more responsibility.

45:57.381 --> 45:58.549
Means he believes in you.

46:00.634 --> 46:01.635
I'm proud of you.

46:01.719 --> 46:03.178
- You proud of me?
- Yeah.

46:03.262 --> 46:05.014
That is a good thing.

46:09.685 --> 46:10.978
I love you, too.

46:11.145 --> 46:12.146
Come here.

46:36.378 --> 46:38.339
Wires in the semi are in place.

46:38.422 --> 46:40.716
We'll do the same to the warehouse
once you're gone.

46:49.224 --> 46:50.464
I know you've done this before.

46:50.893 --> 46:51.894
Undercover.

46:53.604 --> 46:54.688
Do you have any advice?

46:59.568 --> 47:02.112
Just be yourself, John.

47:03.155 --> 47:04.490
Try to be something you're not,

47:04.573 --> 47:06.909
their bloodhounds will smell it right away.

47:09.495 --> 47:11.747
You're a family man,
you're trying to stay afloat.

47:13.165 --> 47:14.500
You got means they could use.

47:15.709 --> 47:16.710
That's it.

47:16.794 --> 47:19.394
You hide in plain sight
and you just keep doing what you're doing.

47:19.463 --> 47:21.465
And they'll believe it because it's the truth.

47:24.802 --> 47:28.013
All right. Audio's up. Here we go.

47:29.598 --> 47:32.059
Truck's GPS is on his tail. Right?

47:32.142 --> 47:33.143
You got it.

47:38.148 --> 47:39.191
I'm here.

48:19.732 --> 48:20.733
Where we going?

48:20.983 --> 48:22.234
El Paso. Right by the border.

48:22.317 --> 48:23.902
That's over a thousand miles.

48:24.737 --> 48:27.281
What'd you think?
We were just going around the corner?

48:57.019 --> 48:58.140
If you don't mind me asking,

49:00.022 --> 49:01.607
how long were you in prison for?

49:02.900 --> 49:04.777
Just a little over a nickel total.

49:06.570 --> 49:07.946
You never told me if you had kids.

49:08.572 --> 49:09.990
What are you doing, man?

49:10.073 --> 49:11.867
Just don't do that.

49:11.950 --> 49:13.702
You don't need to ask me
about my life, all right?

49:13.786 --> 49:15.627
And I won't ask you about yours. Let's just...

49:39.937 --> 49:41.855
Guy said we're about 150 miles out.

52:09.628 --> 52:11.880
I got it, Daniel. I got it. I got it.

53:48.351 --> 53:49.352
Shit.

53:59.029 --> 54:00.113
No, no.

54:40.987 --> 54:42.572
Come on, we gotta
get this thing moving!

54:42.656 --> 54:44.950
We can't! We can't! Check my right!

54:45.033 --> 54:46.409
- Check my right!
- You're good,

54:46.493 --> 54:47.577
you're good, you're good!

54:54.334 --> 54:55.494
Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop, stop.

55:02.801 --> 55:04.081
Keep moving! Go! Go! Go!

55:22.404 --> 55:23.444
John, where are you going?

55:27.409 --> 55:28.702
Shit.

55:53.185 --> 55:54.227
Matthews left in the semi

55:54.311 --> 55:55.353
hitting Torres' ride in the process.

55:55.437 --> 55:56.479
Is Torres mobile?

55:56.646 --> 55:57.772
Negative.

55:57.856 --> 55:59.357
We got local PDs responding to shots fired.

55:59.482 --> 56:01.902
Tell Torres to supersede PD.
No one sets foot in that yard.

56:01.985 --> 56:04.487
No one tips off Malik's suppliers.

56:05.906 --> 56:06.907
Torres, talk to me.

56:18.543 --> 56:19.628
Let's go. Let's go!

56:22.631 --> 56:23.632
What the hell was that?

56:23.715 --> 56:25.300
I don't know, man. We gotta hide this thing.

56:25.383 --> 56:26.551
No, we gotta get back on the interstate.

56:26.635 --> 56:27.969
Public. Moving.

56:40.857 --> 56:43.401
<i>Yeah, man,
I'm sorry for your trouble.</i>

56:43.568 --> 56:44.819
Your driver...

56:46.571 --> 56:50.867
He has fortitude.
He handled the situation very well.

56:53.620 --> 56:54.788
We will use that.

56:55.163 --> 56:57.999
<i>Glad to hear it.
I'll let you know when he get here.</i>

57:01.336 --> 57:02.879
Them <i>eses</i> don't play, boy.

57:02.963 --> 57:04.798
Smoked every one of them busters.

57:04.881 --> 57:06.925
They out back digging ditches right now.

57:07.801 --> 57:08.843
Who tried to jack 'em?

57:09.803 --> 57:11.346
Man, I don't even care, nigga.

57:11.429 --> 57:13.807
All I care about is El Topo loving them trucks.

57:13.932 --> 57:15.976
Gonna take our game to a whole nother level.

57:16.059 --> 57:17.602
- You hear?
- Yeah.

57:23.608 --> 57:25.777
<i>You have one new message.</i>

57:25.986 --> 57:27.362
<i>Hi, honey, I got
your message about</i>

57:27.445 --> 57:29.906
<i>your meeting being delayed.
Um, but Izzy's really</i>

57:30.031 --> 57:32.575
<i>excited to make you dinner tomorrow night.</i>

57:32.659 --> 57:33.868
<i>I love you. Bye.</i>

57:47.882 --> 57:49.443
All right, everybody, get live.

58:11.948 --> 58:12.949
All right, we here.

58:13.033 --> 58:14.784
Black Yukon's on Worth and 4th.

58:14.868 --> 58:17.579
Put the work in the back of
your boy's truck and follow it.

58:17.746 --> 58:19.873
Malik, you know that had
nothing to do with us, man.

58:19.998 --> 58:22.083
Man, just handle business
and get there, homey.

58:23.084 --> 58:24.919
He's changing up the meet.

58:25.045 --> 58:26.725
Said he wants us to put it in your pickup.

58:31.926 --> 58:32.927
All right.

58:33.303 --> 58:35.388
There's a hidden compartment
behind the back seat.

58:37.849 --> 58:38.892
Where are you going?

58:39.017 --> 58:40.018
Take a leak.

58:57.869 --> 58:58.870
Yeah.

59:26.815 --> 59:28.024
Tell me you got a wire in that truck.

59:28.108 --> 59:29.109
In the dash in the back.

59:29.192 --> 59:31.528
Sims, get that needle on two.

59:31.611 --> 59:33.491
I need Raven One over
at the following location.

59:43.498 --> 59:46.084
Who'd you call, John?

59:46.167 --> 59:48.253
I asked you a question. Who'd you call, man?

59:48.837 --> 59:49.838
My wife.

59:49.921 --> 59:54.217
Your wife. You expect me
to believe that, man?

59:54.300 --> 59:56.553
Why don't you go ahead
and grab that beam for me, man.

59:56.761 --> 59:57.801
When I say grab that beam,

59:57.846 --> 59:59.597
turn your ass around and grab that beam.

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:02.517
You want to play me, man?

01:00:05.895 --> 01:00:09.482
John, you need to know that
if this comes down to either you or me,

01:00:09.566 --> 01:00:11.693
I will take your life.

01:00:11.776 --> 01:00:15.488
I will shoot you where you stand,
do you understand me?

01:00:15.572 --> 01:00:17.699
Now I'm gonna ask you one last time.

01:00:17.782 --> 01:00:19.200
Who did you call?

01:00:22.162 --> 01:00:23.163
My wife.

01:00:23.997 --> 01:00:24.998
You want to bullshit me, man?

01:00:25.123 --> 01:00:26.124
It was my wife!

01:00:26.458 --> 01:00:28.293
It was my wife. Daniel, it was my wife!

01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:30.003
Come on, man, don't you lie to me!

01:00:30.128 --> 01:00:31.129
That's the truth!

01:00:32.255 --> 01:00:33.339
You have a cell phone in your truck.

01:00:33.465 --> 01:00:34.466
Why didn't you use it?

01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:35.592
I wanted her to see

01:00:35.675 --> 01:00:39.387
the caller ID from the warehouse so she
believes that I'm working my ass off

01:00:39.471 --> 01:00:42.807
to save the company. That's the truth.

01:00:46.728 --> 01:00:49.397
You did this. You did this.

01:01:37.028 --> 01:01:38.029
Lay back.

01:02:01.886 --> 01:02:03.007
Go on and flash your lights.

01:02:38.756 --> 01:02:39.757
All right, right here.

01:02:50.351 --> 01:02:52.020
Let's just let them get out first, all right?

01:02:52.145 --> 01:02:54.647
I want to make it easy on him
in case he got other plans.

01:02:54.772 --> 01:02:55.940
Like what?

01:02:57.025 --> 01:02:58.665
Shootin' our asses so he ain't gotta pay.

01:03:00.945 --> 01:03:02.030
All right. We good.

01:03:15.627 --> 01:03:17.067
<i>Hawk is on target.</i>

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:20.120
We'll take them on the way out.

01:03:23.134 --> 01:03:24.774
Welcome to the real party, player.

01:03:24.844 --> 01:03:26.638
Heard it cracked off early.

01:03:26.804 --> 01:03:28.084
<i>You ain't got cold feet, do you?</i>

01:03:29.766 --> 01:03:30.767
I'm here.

01:03:31.351 --> 01:03:32.518
Uh-huh.

01:03:34.103 --> 01:03:35.104
Go on, man.

01:03:54.374 --> 01:03:55.541
Let me see one, man.

01:04:14.477 --> 01:04:15.478
Taste.

01:04:15.687 --> 01:04:16.688
I'm good.

01:04:16.771 --> 01:04:18.314
I ain't asking.

01:04:31.619 --> 01:04:33.287
Get up on you quick, huh?

01:04:39.627 --> 01:04:41.212
Here's 10 Gs of key.

01:04:42.046 --> 01:04:43.214
You're welcome.

01:04:57.895 --> 01:04:59.647
I have visual confirm of the exchange.

01:05:00.314 --> 01:05:01.733
Just hold until my signal.

01:05:09.282 --> 01:05:11.325
<i>I got some people that
want to sit down and talk.</i>

01:05:11.409 --> 01:05:13.077
<i>Could be some serious paper.</i>

01:05:13.578 --> 01:05:14.579
<i>Real serious.</i>

01:05:14.662 --> 01:05:16.164
<i>When?</i>

01:05:18.082 --> 01:05:19.167
I'll let you know.

01:05:24.255 --> 01:05:26.090
Glad to be back in the yard, eh, Cruizer?

01:05:31.262 --> 01:05:33.342
He's heading toward the exit.
What do you want to do?

01:05:39.479 --> 01:05:40.605
Let them go.

01:05:41.105 --> 01:05:42.273
<i>Repeat?</i>

01:05:45.818 --> 01:05:46.939
Repeat. Let them go.

01:05:51.324 --> 01:05:52.617
All right, John,
let's go, man. We're done.

01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:54.180
Let's get out of here, man. Let's go.

01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:57.280
What are you looking at, man?

01:05:57.497 --> 01:05:58.498
Just making sure they're gone.

01:05:58.623 --> 01:06:01.167
They're gone, they would... What's with you?

01:06:02.293 --> 01:06:03.961
The stuff I took. That's it.

01:06:04.128 --> 01:06:05.296
Let's go.

01:06:49.590 --> 01:06:50.967
It's 11:00.

01:06:51.551 --> 01:06:54.095
I thought you were coming home for dinner.
Where were you?

01:06:54.762 --> 01:06:55.763
I was at work.

01:06:56.222 --> 01:06:57.640
No, there's something going on.

01:06:57.723 --> 01:07:00.226
We're supposed to be
an open book, remember?

01:07:00.768 --> 01:07:02.103
Is this about Jason?

01:07:04.188 --> 01:07:05.356
Please talk to me.

01:07:05.439 --> 01:07:06.899
I have no idea what's going on.

01:07:09.861 --> 01:07:11.821
If I help them make arrests,

01:07:11.904 --> 01:07:13.698
they'll reduce Jason's sentence.

01:07:15.032 --> 01:07:17.493
Okay, how? How are you
supposed to help them?

01:07:19.704 --> 01:07:20.788
By doing a drug deal.

01:07:22.373 --> 01:07:23.833
Are you out of your mind?

01:07:23.916 --> 01:07:25.001
You wanted to know.

01:07:25.084 --> 01:07:27.169
- People get shot and killed!
- I know that, Analisa.

01:07:27.253 --> 01:07:28.254
This is my son!

01:07:28.379 --> 01:07:31.382
- You have more than one child, John!
- And I'd do the same thing for her!

01:07:31.465 --> 01:07:32.592
You know that.

01:07:32.717 --> 01:07:35.177
But it is not my rules, okay?
It's their rules.

01:07:35.303 --> 01:07:38.014
Which means every move that I
make or I don't make,

01:07:38.097 --> 01:07:40.808
Jason will have to live with
for the next 10 years of his life.

01:07:40.892 --> 01:07:42.101
And what if you don't live?

01:07:42.977 --> 01:07:44.562
Baby, have you thought about that?

01:07:45.271 --> 01:07:47.398
You have a family here, too.

01:08:03.456 --> 01:08:06.542
And I hope that I have your support
when the time comes.

01:08:06.626 --> 01:08:08.867
You're not old enough to vote
though, are you?

01:08:10.046 --> 01:08:12.173
John, my secretary
said you needed to see me.

01:08:12.256 --> 01:08:13.296
You said all we needed was

01:08:13.341 --> 01:08:14.508
Malik and the drugs in the same place.

01:08:14.634 --> 01:08:16.260
That's exactly what we had last night.

01:08:16.426 --> 01:08:18.179
We had a deal. We had it done.

01:08:18.261 --> 01:08:19.639
- Calm down!
- Don't tell me to calm down!

01:08:19.764 --> 01:08:21.085
I'm not gonna keep my voice down!

01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:22.600
He had 10 keys and he let him go!

01:08:22.683 --> 01:08:23.684
This is my kid's life, God damn it!

01:08:23.768 --> 01:08:24.935
- Keep your voice down!
- It's not just about you!

01:08:25.019 --> 01:08:26.020
Stop it!

01:08:26.103 --> 01:08:28.023
Malik's supplier's
gonna be at the next exchange.

01:08:28.939 --> 01:08:30.232
Cooper made the call,
and it was the right one.

01:08:30.358 --> 01:08:32.526
You go for the highest target, John.

01:08:32.609 --> 01:08:33.778
Now you just have to be patient.

01:08:33.861 --> 01:08:35.071
Take the next meeting.

01:08:35.738 --> 01:08:38.823
Your son will be all right. Oh, great.

01:08:38.908 --> 01:08:41.953
You had Malik single handed
with 10 keys and you let him go?

01:08:42.036 --> 01:08:43.371
He would've given up everybody.

01:08:43.453 --> 01:08:46.290
Oh, bullshit he would've.
I had to make a judgment call.

01:08:46.374 --> 01:08:47.959
No, you didn't. it is my call.

01:08:48.292 --> 01:08:50.461
And I will decide exactly
how this comes down,

01:08:50.544 --> 01:08:52.296
do you understand? Is that clear?

01:08:54.006 --> 01:08:55.174
Crystal.

01:09:14.944 --> 01:09:16.362
Hey, Sylvie.

01:09:19.698 --> 01:09:21.283
And do what?

01:09:34.546 --> 01:09:37.550
Yo, Manny. <i>Dame tu carro,</i> bro.

01:10:04.201 --> 01:10:05.703
I came to visit Jason.
They wouldn't let me see him.

01:10:05.786 --> 01:10:07.147
They said he was in the infirmary.

01:10:07.663 --> 01:10:08.664
What happened?

01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:10.541
He was assaulted.

01:10:11.542 --> 01:10:13.627
They said he had over 36 stitches.

01:10:13.753 --> 01:10:15.421
When they say "assaulted..."

01:10:15.546 --> 01:10:17.173
I don't know,
they said that they were gonna

01:10:17.256 --> 01:10:18.632
keep him in there for at least two more days

01:10:18.716 --> 01:10:21.427
and that there was no way
that you and I could even see him.

01:10:21.886 --> 01:10:23.137
I'm trying here, right?

01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:25.021
I talked to the lawyers at Project Innocence,

01:10:25.097 --> 01:10:26.098
and they said that they were gonna...

01:10:26.223 --> 01:10:28.184
He's not going to last that long, Sylvie.

01:10:28.267 --> 01:10:29.602
I don't see you getting anywhere!

01:10:31.395 --> 01:10:33.147
Oh, God.

01:10:35.357 --> 01:10:39.070
Damn it, I did this
to him. I did it. God damn it.

01:10:39.153 --> 01:10:40.553
- No, you didn't.
- I did.

01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:44.950
I should, I should've known,

01:10:45.034 --> 01:10:46.160
I should've known he was in trouble.

01:10:46.243 --> 01:10:47.828
I should've been able to protect him.

01:10:47.912 --> 01:10:49.538
Please, John.

01:10:49.747 --> 01:10:51.707
Let's end this nightmare.

01:10:57.505 --> 01:10:58.506
It's not your fault.

01:11:02.343 --> 01:11:03.511
John.

01:11:04.512 --> 01:11:05.846
What's going on?

01:11:06.347 --> 01:11:07.348
Did you follow me here?

01:11:08.432 --> 01:11:09.433
Who'd you visit?

01:11:12.186 --> 01:11:13.187
It's my son.

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:17.024
Look, man, he made a mistake,
his friend set him up.

01:11:17.108 --> 01:11:18.317
Wait, wait...

01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:20.201
They said if we cooperate, if we help them...

01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:21.862
You made a deal.

01:11:21.987 --> 01:11:23.405
Geez,

01:11:24.657 --> 01:11:26.659
you got any idea what they're
gonna do to us, man?

01:11:26.742 --> 01:11:28.494
You have any idea?

01:11:28.577 --> 01:11:30.996
It ain't just Malik, man. It's the cartel, man.

01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:32.414
You know what they're gonna
do to our families, man?

01:11:32.498 --> 01:11:33.541
It's my son.

01:11:33.624 --> 01:11:36.836
Your son? What about my son, man?

01:11:36.919 --> 01:11:38.838
I've got a son, John.

01:11:42.466 --> 01:11:43.676
You're a dead man, John.

01:11:46.804 --> 01:11:48.180
You're a dead man.

01:12:06.991 --> 01:12:10.369
Hey, where's your mom?

01:12:11.245 --> 01:12:12.329
She's sleeping.

01:12:22.047 --> 01:12:23.168
Vanessa, what are you doing?

01:12:25.092 --> 01:12:28.721
Is this what you've been doing
on your work trip, huh?

01:12:29.763 --> 01:12:32.433
Can't even take care of
your own goddamn son!

01:12:32.683 --> 01:12:34.268
Stop, Vanessa, he's in the other room. Look,

01:12:34.351 --> 01:12:35.477
it's not what you think, okay? Listen to me.

01:12:35.561 --> 01:12:36.604
It is not what you think.

01:12:36.770 --> 01:12:38.022
Bullshit!

01:12:40.858 --> 01:12:42.610
You made me a promise, Daniel.

01:12:42.776 --> 01:12:44.111
Baby, listen. I need you to pack a bag.

01:12:44.236 --> 01:12:45.696
I stay clean and you stay away from that life,

01:12:45.779 --> 01:12:46.780
- remember?
- Baby...

01:12:46.906 --> 01:12:47.948
I understand, baby.

01:12:48.073 --> 01:12:49.283
But right now, what I need you to do is

01:12:49.366 --> 01:12:51.035
I need you to pack a bag for you and Anthony.

01:12:51.118 --> 01:12:52.119
You need to go stay with your mom.

01:12:52.369 --> 01:12:54.038
You don't tell me what to do.
Not after last night!

01:12:54.121 --> 01:12:56.207
All right, enough! Okay, just...

01:12:56.290 --> 01:12:58.417
Look, I'm, I'm...

01:13:00.628 --> 01:13:03.214
I'm in trouble, baby.

01:13:03.297 --> 01:13:07.009
I am in trouble. Okay.
Please don't do that, Vanessa.

01:13:07.343 --> 01:13:09.428
Sweetheart, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

01:13:09.511 --> 01:13:11.180
look, it's nothing that I can't...

01:13:11.347 --> 01:13:15.643
I can't do it again, Daniel, I can't do it again.

01:13:17.645 --> 01:13:20.231
I can't watch you go to prison or...

01:13:20.314 --> 01:13:22.316
Or end up dead.

01:13:22.816 --> 01:13:24.777
Baby, that is not gonna happen,
do you hear me?

01:13:24.860 --> 01:13:25.861
That is not gonna happen.

01:13:25.986 --> 01:13:27.266
I'm not going anywhere, sweetie.

01:13:27.488 --> 01:13:29.865
Why do you do this to us?

01:13:29.949 --> 01:13:33.369
Why do you keep doing this?

01:13:34.954 --> 01:13:37.790
I can't, I can't, I can't!

01:13:39.333 --> 01:13:41.168
- I'm sorry.

01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:47.341
Oh, shit.

01:13:57.184 --> 01:13:58.769
- They just came right in.
- Where's Isabelle?

01:13:58.852 --> 01:13:59.979
She's still at school.

01:14:00.688 --> 01:14:03.023
Get her and take her to
your sister's now. Go! Go!

01:14:09.196 --> 01:14:10.436
What are you doing here, Malik?

01:14:10.698 --> 01:14:12.449
I like your old lady.

01:14:15.035 --> 01:14:16.203
She in a hurry, huh?

01:14:17.121 --> 01:14:18.122
What do you want?

01:14:21.542 --> 01:14:22.835
You want that paper, right?

01:14:23.627 --> 01:14:24.628
What about Daniel?

01:14:24.712 --> 01:14:25.879
What about him?

01:15:21.435 --> 01:15:22.895
Come on, man, El Topo waitin'.

01:15:23.103 --> 01:15:24.229
Only him.

01:15:57.137 --> 01:15:58.138
Arms up.

01:16:16.824 --> 01:16:17.950
You have a cell phone?

01:16:18.992 --> 01:16:19.993
Yeah.

01:16:20.077 --> 01:16:21.745
It no longer works.

01:16:22.413 --> 01:16:24.123
And anything else on you electronic.

01:17:17.885 --> 01:17:20.846
I understand your business
is in a complicated spot.

01:17:22.055 --> 01:17:23.724
Pretty hard to make money nowadays.

01:17:25.225 --> 01:17:28.061
It doesn't have to be.

01:17:28.145 --> 01:17:31.148
When you work for us,
you will be treated like family.

01:17:31.231 --> 01:17:34.902
This of course includes your wife.
And your child.

01:17:36.528 --> 01:17:39.573
I hear Isabelle is a beautiful girl.

01:17:39.740 --> 01:17:43.076
You and Analisa are really lucky to have her.

01:17:45.746 --> 01:17:46.747
Thank you.

01:17:47.748 --> 01:17:48.874
<i>Bueno.</i>

01:17:50.250 --> 01:17:53.003
You will make this next trip alone.

01:17:53.086 --> 01:17:55.672
Once you make the pick up,
you will take it into Mexico.

01:17:55.756 --> 01:17:58.175
We will unload your
construction supplies as well

01:17:58.258 --> 01:17:59.760
before you cross back over the border

01:17:59.843 --> 01:18:01.553
so everything looks legitimate.

01:18:02.095 --> 01:18:05.933
Palacio will pay you $250,000.

01:18:07.726 --> 01:18:11.021
If all goes well, you will see much more.

01:18:13.106 --> 01:18:15.776
Show us your loyalty

01:18:15.901 --> 01:18:18.111
and your future will be bright, my friend.

01:18:36.964 --> 01:18:39.716
I will call you the day
after tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.,

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:41.301
with an address. Be ready to leave.

01:18:44.471 --> 01:18:45.639
What about Malik?

01:18:46.139 --> 01:18:47.307
You work for us now.

01:18:56.650 --> 01:18:59.278
Let's get one thing clear, man,
you still works for me.

01:19:01.655 --> 01:19:02.656
Got it.

01:19:03.991 --> 01:19:06.326
Just handle your business, playa.

01:19:07.077 --> 01:19:09.997
'Cause I ain't lettin' nobody
get in the way of me and my bread.

01:19:39.318 --> 01:19:41.028
John, are you okay?

01:19:41.111 --> 01:19:42.112
Are you at Gabby's yet?

01:19:42.529 --> 01:19:43.530
I'm, like, 30 minutes.

01:19:45.532 --> 01:19:46.658
You can't go there now.

01:19:47.701 --> 01:19:48.702
Why?

01:19:48.827 --> 01:19:50.787
<i>I need you to pull over
so we can talk about this.</i>

01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:53.624
No, goddamn it, tell me now.

01:19:53.707 --> 01:19:55.709
What is happening? Is my sister in danger?

01:19:56.209 --> 01:19:57.210
Mommy?

01:19:58.128 --> 01:19:59.880
<i>Where are we?</i>

01:20:02.049 --> 01:20:04.885
<i>I love you, John. I do.</i>

01:20:20.567 --> 01:20:22.235
They knew my wife and kids'
name, damn it. What if

01:20:22.361 --> 01:20:24.154
- they know about Jason?
- They don't.

01:20:24.237 --> 01:20:25.437
How the hell do you know that?

01:20:25.530 --> 01:20:27.240
Because from the moment
we started this operation,

01:20:27.366 --> 01:20:28.867
we logged you separately into NTIS.

01:20:29.034 --> 01:20:30.035
What is NTIS?

01:20:30.243 --> 01:20:31.995
It's a Fed database.

01:20:32.079 --> 01:20:33.664
Anyone who logs into your case file,

01:20:33.747 --> 01:20:35.916
runs your name or Jason's, they notify me.

01:20:36.083 --> 01:20:37.751
They ran your name yesterday at noon.

01:20:37.876 --> 01:20:40.045
That's why they know
about Analisa and Isabelle.

01:20:40.420 --> 01:20:41.900
- And not Jason?
- No, because

01:20:42.089 --> 01:20:43.674
he's listed under his mother's maiden name,

01:20:43.757 --> 01:20:47.094
and you don't have
the same address. He's safe.

01:20:50.097 --> 01:20:51.264
Who'd you meet with?

01:20:53.266 --> 01:20:54.601
Malik called him "El Topo."

01:21:08.073 --> 01:21:10.075
- Who is he?
- He's Juan Carlos Pintera.

01:21:10.283 --> 01:21:13.620
They call him "The Mole." El Topo.

01:21:14.621 --> 01:21:16.373
He's ex Mexican paramilitary,

01:21:16.456 --> 01:21:19.042
and he runs this region
for the Nuevo LeÃ³n cartel.

01:21:19.251 --> 01:21:20.585
That's who he is.

01:21:20.961 --> 01:21:23.714
Getting Pintera would seriously
cripple their organization.

01:21:23.964 --> 01:21:25.465
What did he say about the run?

01:21:27.134 --> 01:21:28.802
Just that there was another pickup.

01:21:28.885 --> 01:21:30.387
And I gotta take it into Mexico.

01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:32.389
What, into Mexico?

01:21:32.472 --> 01:21:33.473
Why?

01:21:34.808 --> 01:21:36.268
Because that means

01:21:36.393 --> 01:21:38.433
you're running their money
this time. You see, John,

01:21:38.478 --> 01:21:40.319
one of the ways that we're fighting the cartel

01:21:40.439 --> 01:21:42.065
is to stop them getting their profits.

01:21:42.149 --> 01:21:43.650
Right now, it's virtually impossible

01:21:43.817 --> 01:21:45.318
for them to wire money in,

01:21:45.402 --> 01:21:49.072
so they have to physically transport it.

01:21:49.156 --> 01:21:50.824
Hundreds of millions of dollars.

01:21:50.991 --> 01:21:53.160
This could be an incredible
opportunity for us.

01:21:53.326 --> 01:21:55.579
Especially if we got Pintera, too.

01:21:55.996 --> 01:21:57.557
Can I talk to you for a minute?

01:22:00.083 --> 01:22:01.084
Yeah, sure.

01:22:01.168 --> 01:22:04.671
John, would you excuse us
for a second? I'd appreciate it.

01:22:08.675 --> 01:22:09.676
Thanks.

01:22:15.015 --> 01:22:17.517
- What?
- You know damn well what.

01:22:18.185 --> 01:22:21.021
El Topo's a game changer,
and he's way out of his depth.

01:22:22.606 --> 01:22:23.940
Are you kidding me?

01:22:24.024 --> 01:22:26.193
- We can still bring in Malik.
- No, no, no.

01:22:26.276 --> 01:22:27.277
We can squeeze him for a third strike...

01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:28.361
We get... There's no way

01:22:28.487 --> 01:22:29.780
El Topo's gonna be
at that exchange tomorrow.

01:22:29.863 --> 01:22:31.364
I am not missing this opportunity.

01:22:31.490 --> 01:22:34.201
Even if we don't get him,
you know the way this works.

01:22:34.284 --> 01:22:36.870
You follow the drugs, you get players.
You follow the money...

01:22:37.037 --> 01:22:38.705
- Yeah...
- You get a kingpin.

01:22:38.872 --> 01:22:41.958
Yeah, you know that if he crosses that border,
he's never coming back.

01:22:42.042 --> 01:22:43.210
You good with that?

01:22:52.552 --> 01:22:53.678
John?

01:22:57.390 --> 01:22:59.476
Sit down. Drink?

01:22:59.976 --> 01:23:01.019
No.

01:23:02.145 --> 01:23:03.396
- Coffee?
- No.

01:23:07.651 --> 01:23:09.736
Look, we had a deal. I deliver Malik to you,

01:23:09.861 --> 01:23:11.988
you reduce my son's sentence to a year.

01:23:12.072 --> 01:23:14.825
I'm really sorry,
but we are way past Malik now.

01:23:14.908 --> 01:23:15.909
If we pick him up,

01:23:15.992 --> 01:23:17.353
we're going to tip off the cartel.

01:23:17.369 --> 01:23:18.745
And what if I go to a judge?

01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:21.248
You can if you want to,

01:23:21.373 --> 01:23:23.583
but with the mandatory minimum laws,

01:23:23.667 --> 01:23:25.502
a judge has no say to reduce the sentence.

01:23:25.585 --> 01:23:27.087
Only the federal prosecutor does.

01:23:27.170 --> 01:23:28.380
And that's me.

01:23:29.422 --> 01:23:31.842
Look, this is the last stop.

01:23:31.925 --> 01:23:34.761
You've been very patient. I give you my word.

01:23:34.845 --> 01:23:37.097
Your son is coming home soon.

01:23:39.099 --> 01:23:40.100
Immediately.

01:23:40.517 --> 01:23:41.518
Excuse me?

01:23:41.601 --> 01:23:44.688
I go through with this,
Jason comes home that instant.

01:23:44.771 --> 01:23:45.939
Then I'll make sure that every parent

01:23:46.064 --> 01:23:47.385
out there knows how compassionate

01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:48.859
you've been to my son.

01:23:51.444 --> 01:23:52.445
Okay.

01:23:52.946 --> 01:23:54.197
You complete this,

01:23:54.281 --> 01:23:56.616
and I will have the judge release your son.

01:23:57.534 --> 01:24:00.036
But I need the money,

01:24:00.745 --> 01:24:02.122
and the arrest of a cartel player.

01:24:02.205 --> 01:24:03.582
Nothing less.

01:24:10.297 --> 01:24:11.798
Hey, John.

01:24:11.965 --> 01:24:14.126
What time are they calling you
with the pickup address?

01:24:15.135 --> 01:24:16.636
10:30 tomorrow morning.

01:24:18.305 --> 01:24:19.806
The reason they pick Sunday,

01:24:19.931 --> 01:24:23.310
it's a high traffic day at the border.
Less inspections.

01:24:23.977 --> 01:24:25.737
You don't think this is a good idea, do you?

01:24:25.812 --> 01:24:27.898
Hey, man, don't matter what I think.

01:24:27.981 --> 01:24:29.983
You made a deal with
the dragon lady. Not me.

01:24:32.277 --> 01:24:33.757
John, you gotta know there's a reason

01:24:33.778 --> 01:24:35.822
they picked you so quick for this run.

01:24:37.115 --> 01:24:40.535
Cartels don't use their
own people to carry loads.

01:24:40.660 --> 01:24:41.828
They recruit.

01:24:42.287 --> 01:24:43.830
Guys like you...

01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:49.294
Favorite target is
a middle-class kid in a school.

01:24:50.670 --> 01:24:52.130
Make it sound all exciting

01:24:52.213 --> 01:24:53.632
to carry a backpack full of dope

01:24:53.715 --> 01:24:57.010
for pockets full of cash. And then they do it.

01:24:58.303 --> 01:25:00.055
These guys threaten to kill their families.

01:25:00.180 --> 01:25:01.973
They use them, they abuse them.

01:25:02.057 --> 01:25:03.537
They end up in a barrel full of acid.

01:25:03.642 --> 01:25:05.352
That's it, they're gone. Done.

01:25:05.477 --> 01:25:06.645
Easy come, easy go.

01:25:06.728 --> 01:25:09.856
Because there's always gonna be
another mule to take their place.

01:25:10.482 --> 01:25:11.442
Brother, you gotta know,

01:25:11.524 --> 01:25:14.694
this is one serious backpack
you're about to carry.

01:25:25.038 --> 01:25:26.581
Hello. I'm here to see my son.

01:25:26.706 --> 01:25:27.666
He should be out of the infirmary.

01:25:27.749 --> 01:25:29.501
Is he under "Matthews"?

01:25:29.584 --> 01:25:31.378
Jason Collins.

01:25:32.087 --> 01:25:33.380
Okay. Just sign in.

01:25:40.220 --> 01:25:41.380
- Go to window 4.
- All right.

01:25:41.721 --> 01:25:42.722
Thank you.

01:25:57.237 --> 01:25:58.238
Are you okay?

01:25:59.864 --> 01:26:00.865
I'm fine.

01:26:01.533 --> 01:26:04.744
God damn it. I can't keep
letting this happen to you.

01:26:05.245 --> 01:26:06.645
They say anything about moving you?

01:26:09.124 --> 01:26:11.835
How is everybody?

01:26:11.918 --> 01:26:15.046
How's Izzy? She doing all right?

01:26:23.304 --> 01:26:25.390
I've been wanting to tell you something.

01:26:26.891 --> 01:26:30.729
I admire you so much.
The stand you're taking.

01:26:32.272 --> 01:26:34.149
You didn't take the easy way out.

01:26:34.899 --> 01:26:36.985
Not setting up one of your friends.

01:26:38.820 --> 01:26:40.280
I couldn't do what you did.

01:26:44.659 --> 01:26:47.829
So it looks like you're the one teaching me

01:26:48.997 --> 01:26:54.335
what real character and integrity is all about.

01:26:59.299 --> 01:27:00.508
I love you, son.

01:27:01.843 --> 01:27:03.011
I love you, too.

01:27:20.653 --> 01:27:21.696
Who is it?

01:27:22.781 --> 01:27:23.782
It's John.

01:27:26.826 --> 01:27:27.986
What are you doing here, man?

01:27:28.036 --> 01:27:30.538
I'm parked a few blocks away
just in case somebody's watching.

01:27:33.124 --> 01:27:34.167
Daniel, thank you

01:27:34.375 --> 01:27:35.877
for not ratting me out.

01:27:37.045 --> 01:27:38.546
Believe me, man, I thought about it.

01:27:39.714 --> 01:27:41.800
If I don't go through with this,

01:27:42.509 --> 01:27:43.885
they're not gonna release my son.

01:27:44.052 --> 01:27:45.553
But you don't understand, man,

01:27:45.678 --> 01:27:47.806
you play nice with the feds, man,

01:27:47.889 --> 01:27:49.490
but what happens when Malik and everyone

01:27:49.516 --> 01:27:50.725
finds out you're an informant?

01:27:50.850 --> 01:27:51.976
What happens to me?

01:27:52.060 --> 01:27:54.229
That puts me right with you.
They know I'm a rat.

01:27:54.354 --> 01:27:56.856
They will hunt us down, man. They will...

01:27:58.691 --> 01:28:00.527
They're gonna come after our families, John.

01:28:01.528 --> 01:28:03.905
Daniel, I know I'm the one
who put us all in this danger.

01:28:06.741 --> 01:28:07.992
And I gotta live with that.

01:28:09.077 --> 01:28:10.870
There is no way

01:28:11.496 --> 01:28:15.667
that I'm gonna let either side dictate our fates.

01:28:16.543 --> 01:28:17.544
No way.

01:28:56.374 --> 01:28:57.374
<i>The address come through?</i>

01:28:57.417 --> 01:28:58.418
Yeah, I know the area.

01:28:58.543 --> 01:29:00.663
It's gonna take about an hour
and a half to get there.

01:29:00.962 --> 01:29:03.298
<i>The route is only 52
miles west of your warehouse.</i>

01:29:03.423 --> 01:29:05.425
Well, it's still gonna take 90 minutes in a semi.

01:29:05.550 --> 01:29:07.427
<i>- No longer.</i>
- I'm leaving now.

01:29:20.398 --> 01:29:21.438
Both wires loud and clear.

01:29:24.903 --> 01:29:26.446
Our guy's 12 miles out.

01:30:12.158 --> 01:30:13.368
He's been sitting there 15 minutes.

01:30:13.493 --> 01:30:14.494
What's he doing?

01:30:14.619 --> 01:30:15.620
Shit.

01:30:16.329 --> 01:30:17.622
All right. Let's do a drive by.

01:30:38.476 --> 01:30:41.479
Shit. Anybody hear anything?
Voices? Struggle?

01:30:42.522 --> 01:30:44.023
Where the hell are you, John?

01:30:52.073 --> 01:30:53.324
What took you so long?

01:30:53.700 --> 01:30:55.201
Just lost the DEA. We're on.

01:30:55.326 --> 01:30:57.203
Hey, John. You're sure you can
pull this off, right?

01:30:57.328 --> 01:30:59.872
Not without your part, no. I need that number.

01:30:59.998 --> 01:31:00.999
All right.

01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:42.957
We counted every dollar.

01:31:43.791 --> 01:31:45.251
You will be responsible for it.

01:31:49.464 --> 01:31:50.704
We can't track him by the cell.

01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:52.300
Maybe it's turned off.

01:31:52.759 --> 01:31:53.926
Why would he ditch us?

01:31:58.097 --> 01:31:59.098
What's the address in Mexico?

01:31:59.182 --> 01:32:00.183
Get to El Paso,

01:32:00.266 --> 01:32:03.686
to the main border crossing.
I will tell you which lane.

01:32:03.936 --> 01:32:06.272
Only you are going to be in
the truck to avoid suspicion.

01:32:06.356 --> 01:32:08.232
We're gonna follow in the cars.

01:32:08.316 --> 01:32:11.517
Once you cross, our people in JuÃ¡rez,
they're gonna direct you to the final stop.

01:32:11.944 --> 01:32:12.945
All right.

01:35:04.617 --> 01:35:06.452
Like them yard tactics, homey.

01:35:09.539 --> 01:35:10.998
Straight bum rush.

01:35:15.461 --> 01:35:16.963
That's the Cruizer I know.

01:35:19.298 --> 01:35:20.967
I need a number on El Topo, bruh.

01:35:37.650 --> 01:35:40.820
Yo, Malik, you want me to call 911?

01:35:42.321 --> 01:35:45.074
Me and you both know
they already on their way.

01:36:11.183 --> 01:36:12.544
- Yeah.
<i>- You and I both know</i>

01:36:12.602 --> 01:36:14.395
if I cross into Mexico, I'm a dead man.

01:36:14.687 --> 01:36:16.272
So you think you're better off going alone?

01:36:16.355 --> 01:36:18.482
Despite what you might think of me, John,

01:36:18.566 --> 01:36:20.276
I am your only protection on this.

01:36:20.443 --> 01:36:21.694
Yeah, maybe so.

01:36:21.777 --> 01:36:23.857
But as many times as you guys
changed the game on me,

01:36:23.863 --> 01:36:25.503
I had to put some things into play first.

01:36:25.531 --> 01:36:26.741
Yeah, like what exactly?

01:36:26.866 --> 01:36:27.867
You know my deal with Keeghan

01:36:27.950 --> 01:36:29.201
was for the money and the bust.

01:36:29.368 --> 01:36:32.168
Well, I'm gonna make sure that that happens
on this side of the border.

01:36:36.876 --> 01:36:38.836
I want you to track
the cell number that I'm on.

01:36:38.919 --> 01:36:40.520
<i>I'm in one of my other trucks right now,</i>

01:36:40.546 --> 01:36:41.826
<i>and it's filled with their cash.</i>

01:36:41.881 --> 01:36:43.682
John, listen to me, I just got a hit on NTIS.

01:36:43.758 --> 01:36:44.800
<i>Somebody connected you to Jason.</i>

01:36:44.884 --> 01:36:46.804
<i>I don't know who it is but we 're working on it.</i>

01:36:49.388 --> 01:36:50.588
<i>John, can you hear me?</i>

01:36:54.060 --> 01:36:55.144
Pull over now.

01:36:55.561 --> 01:36:56.801
<i>What's happening there?</i>

01:37:03.402 --> 01:37:05.863
They know. Get Jason in protective custody.

01:37:05.946 --> 01:37:07.307
<i>They'll have people on the inside.</i>

01:37:07.323 --> 01:37:08.884
Don't you worry about him. We're on it.

01:37:08.908 --> 01:37:10.201
We got units coming to him now.

01:37:10.284 --> 01:37:11.285
Already got the prison on lockdown.

01:37:11.410 --> 01:37:12.536
He's in an isolation cell.

01:37:12.620 --> 01:37:13.954
<i>Locate a second number.</i>

01:37:14.121 --> 01:37:15.539
It's 517

01:37:15.623 --> 01:37:19.669
555-0199. It's El Topo's cell.

01:37:19.919 --> 01:37:21.629
Get me that number track now!

01:38:13.055 --> 01:38:14.098
Did you get him?

01:38:14.181 --> 01:38:15.725
Yeah, we locked his position off his cell.

01:38:15.808 --> 01:38:17.184
I have tactical teams en route.

01:38:17.309 --> 01:38:18.853
I'm shot. In the leg.

01:38:19.186 --> 01:38:22.189
John, listen to me. Hang in there.
I got units responding to you now.

01:38:22.314 --> 01:38:23.983
<i>Just get off at Woodward.</i>

01:38:24.066 --> 01:38:26.026
<i>It's the next exit.
I'll have them converge there.</i>

01:38:37.830 --> 01:38:39.373
- Clear.
- Kitchen clear.

01:38:39.498 --> 01:38:40.499
House is all clear.

01:38:41.167 --> 01:38:42.168
<i>No one's home.</i>

01:38:49.675 --> 01:38:50.676
Just missed him.

01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:51.844
Turn around.

01:38:52.261 --> 01:38:54.513
He's heading north on Nichols.
Seal the perimeter.

01:38:57.767 --> 01:38:58.893
<i>Aguas, Topo.</i>

01:38:59.852 --> 01:39:02.772
All right, show me hands!
Show the hands now!

01:39:04.190 --> 01:39:05.483
No, no, no, no.

01:39:06.692 --> 01:39:08.694
Get me your hands in the air!

01:39:14.450 --> 01:39:15.534
Shut it Off!

01:39:16.118 --> 01:39:17.119
Keep 'em up!

01:42:40.406 --> 01:42:42.574
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we are here today</i>

01:42:42.658 --> 01:42:46.370
<i>to announce the arrest of Juan Carlos Pintera</i>

01:42:46.453 --> 01:42:51.125
<i>and other key members
of the Nuevo LeÃ³n cartel.</i>

01:42:51.250 --> 01:42:55.004
<i>Rest assured we will be
safer tonight. Thank you.</i>

01:42:55.087 --> 01:42:56.247
So you going to vote for her?

01:43:01.427 --> 01:43:02.428
John.

01:43:03.095 --> 01:43:05.639
You did a great thing. Thank you so much.

01:43:05.764 --> 01:43:07.766
I only wish I could tell people about it.

01:43:08.475 --> 01:43:09.560
Ah, it's okay.

01:43:09.643 --> 01:43:12.021
As long as I see Jason free
in the morning is all I need.

01:43:12.646 --> 01:43:15.566
7:00 a.m. sharp he'll be out.

01:43:15.649 --> 01:43:16.984
So how is your family dealing

01:43:17.109 --> 01:43:18.527
with going into witness protection?

01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:22.364
I haven't told them yet.

01:43:30.789 --> 01:43:33.459
Coop, Daniel James.

01:43:34.626 --> 01:43:35.627
Hey.

01:43:36.503 --> 01:43:37.629
How's the arm?

01:43:38.172 --> 01:43:39.214
I'll live.

01:43:41.633 --> 01:43:42.801
Heard you're refusing WitSec.

01:43:43.052 --> 01:43:45.262
Yeah, we, we got a plan.

01:43:45.345 --> 01:43:47.222
We're just gonna disappear on our own.

01:43:50.684 --> 01:43:51.884
So what did you need me to do,

01:43:51.977 --> 01:43:53.145
a statement, right? That's why I'm here?

01:43:53.228 --> 01:43:54.229
Mmm-hmm.

01:43:54.897 --> 01:43:56.315
You can start by signing that.

01:43:56.648 --> 01:43:57.983
Wait a second, man. What is that?

01:43:58.067 --> 01:44:00.527
Listen, you got nothing to
worry about, Daniel.

01:44:00.652 --> 01:44:02.738
We know you were instrumental in this bust.

01:44:03.322 --> 01:44:04.323
Hundred Gs?

01:44:04.406 --> 01:44:07.493
Yeah. That's reward money for the capture
of Juan Carlos Pintera.

01:44:08.327 --> 01:44:09.745
That's John Matthews' money, man.

01:44:11.246 --> 01:44:13.286
Well, he said something
about having to lay you off.

01:44:14.917 --> 01:44:16.168
Let's get started.

01:45:07.761 --> 01:45:09.221
Let's go home.

01:45:18.397 --> 01:45:19.481
Thank you.
