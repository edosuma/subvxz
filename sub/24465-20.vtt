WEBVTT

00:11.200 --> 00:14.200
Rigby: SO, HE THINKS THE
DOCTOR CAN SEW IT BACK ON?

00:13.240 --> 00:16.280
Mordecai: YEAH, MUSCLE MAN
THINKS SO.

00:14.840 --> 00:17.880
HE SAID IT HAPPENED TO HIS
BROTHER, TOO.

00:16.320 --> 00:17.260
Rigby: ( WHISTLES )

00:17.360 --> 00:18.180
MAN, HE'S LUCKY.

00:18.280 --> 00:19.660
Mordecai: TELL ME ABOUT IT.

00:19.760 --> 00:23.040
ANYWAY, IT'S GETTING PRETTY
LATE.

00:21.520 --> 00:22.380
I'M GONNA CALL IT.

00:22.480 --> 00:23.580
( CAN OPENS )

00:23.680 --> 00:24.740
Rigby: ( GULPING )

00:24.840 --> 00:28.000
Mordecai: ARE YOU SERIOUSLY
DRINKING A SODA RIGHT NOW?

00:27.240 --> 00:30.320
Rigby: ( GULPING CONTINUES )
( BELCHES )

00:28.800 --> 00:31.680
YEAH. YOU WANT ONE?
Mordecai: DUDE, WHAT?

00:30.760 --> 00:32.100
WE'LL BE UP ALL NIGHT, AND WE

00:32.200 --> 00:35.160
HAVE TO WORK TOMORROW.
Rigby: NAH!

00:33.760 --> 00:34.940
DON'T YOU WATCH THE NEWS?

00:35.040 --> 00:38.280
IT'S DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TONIGHT.
Mordecai: SO?

00:37.120 --> 00:39.060
Rigby: SO THE CLOCKS GET SET

00:39.160 --> 00:41.180
BACK AN HOUR AND WE GET TO SLEEP

00:41.280 --> 00:42.700
IN TOMORROW MORNING!

00:42.800 --> 00:43.780
Mordecai: OH, YEAH!

00:43.880 --> 00:45.060
WELL, IN THAT CASE, SODA ME,

00:45.160 --> 00:47.060
BROâTOâME!

00:47.160 --> 00:48.260
Rigby: OOP!

00:48.360 --> 00:49.340
Both: WHOO!

00:49.440 --> 00:52.560
HAVE A BALL, BABY, LET THE
PARTY BEGIN

00:51.480 --> 00:54.600
IT'S DAYLIGHT SAVINGS, WHEN WE
GET TO SLEEP IN

00:53.440 --> 00:54.300
( BOTH LAUGH )

00:54.400 --> 00:56.340
WHOO!

00:56.440 --> 00:57.540
Mordecai: ( YAWNS )

00:57.640 --> 00:58.980
DUDE, I FEEL SO RESTED.

00:59.080 --> 00:59.980
Rigby: ME TOO.

01:00.080 --> 01:01.300
MAN, I WISH EVERY DAY WAS

01:01.400 --> 01:02.340
DAYLIGHT SAVINGS.

01:02.440 --> 01:04.300
Benson: WELL, LOOK WHO

01:04.400 --> 01:06.700
DECIDED TO SHOW UP ââ AN HOUR

01:06.800 --> 01:07.460
LATE!

01:07.560 --> 01:10.200
( BOTH LAUGH )
Rigby: THEY DON'T KNOW!

01:09.640 --> 01:10.980
I GUESS YOU GUYS HAVEN'T HEARD

01:11.080 --> 01:12.500
OF A LITTLE SOMETHING CALLED

01:12.600 --> 01:14.660
"DAYLIGHT SAVINGS."

01:14.760 --> 01:15.860
Mordecai: ( CHUCKLES )

01:15.960 --> 01:17.260
YEAH. TECHNICALLY, YOU GUYS

01:17.360 --> 01:20.480
SHOWED UP AN HOUR EARLY.
Benson: ( LAUGHS MOCKINGLY )

01:20.200 --> 01:23.640
TECHNICALLY, DAYLIGHT SAVINGS
ISN'T UNTIL TONIGHT.

01:22.960 --> 01:23.860
Rigby: REALLY? HUH.

01:23.960 --> 01:24.700
Mordecai: OOPS.

01:24.800 --> 01:25.780
Rigby: WHATEVER, DUDE.

01:25.880 --> 01:26.700
IT'S JUST AN HOUR.

01:26.800 --> 01:27.660
Benson: OH, IS IT?

01:27.760 --> 01:30.920
WELL, THEN I GUESS YOU WON'T
CARE THAT IT'S AN HOUR YOU

01:30.040 --> 01:33.080
AREN'T GETTING PAID FOR.
Both: AW, WHAT?!

01:31.960 --> 01:33.060
Mordecai: COME ON, BENSON.

01:33.160 --> 01:36.080
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
Benson: BEING ON TIME IS THE

01:35.480 --> 01:37.920
BIG DEAL.
THIS IS A BUSINESS WE'RE TRYING

01:37.360 --> 01:39.680
TO RUN.
IF EVERYONE SHOWED UP LATE LIKE

01:38.960 --> 01:40.260
YOU TWO, THIS WHOLE PARK WOULD

01:40.360 --> 01:42.800
FALL APART.
Mordecai: IT WAS AN HONEST

01:42.280 --> 01:45.120
MISTAKE, BENSON.
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'VE NEVER BEEN

01:44.480 --> 01:45.100
LATE TO WORK.

01:45.200 --> 01:46.460
Benson: ACTUALLY, I HAVEN'T,

01:46.560 --> 01:47.980
BECAUSE, UNLIKE YOU TWO, I TAKE

01:48.080 --> 01:48.900
MY JOB SERIOUSLY.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.360
AND SINCE YOU'RE HAVING SO MUCH
TROUBLE KEEPING TRACK OF TIME,

01:51.880 --> 01:55.280
YOU CAN BE IN CHARGE OF SETTING
THE CLOCKS BACK FOR THE REAL

01:54.720 --> 01:57.800
DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME.
Mordecai: UGH! FINE.

01:57.120 --> 01:57.980
COME ON, RIGBY.

01:58.080 --> 01:59.620
LET'S GET THIS OVER WITH.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.300
Benson: HOLD IT! NOT YET.

02:01.400 --> 02:04.640
YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT WHEN THE
REST OF THE WORLD DOES IT ââ AT

02:04.400 --> 02:05.380
2:00 IN THE MORNING.

02:05.480 --> 02:06.220
Mordecai: WHAT?!

02:06.320 --> 02:09.320
THAT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE ANY
SENSE!

02:07.640 --> 02:11.040
WHY DOES IT MATTER IF EVERYONE'S
ON THE SAME TIME?

02:09.640 --> 02:10.260
Rigby: YEAH!

02:10.360 --> 02:13.480
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?
Benson: ARE YOU SERIOUSLY

02:12.760 --> 02:15.800
MAKING ME DEFEND THE RIGHT
TIME?!

02:14.120 --> 02:17.440
YOU EITHER SET THE PARK CLOCKS
BACK AT 2:00 IN THE MORNING,

02:16.880 --> 02:20.160
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE, OR YOU'RE
FIRED!

02:19.240 --> 02:21.900
( MIDâTEMPO MUSIC PLAYING )

02:22.000 --> 02:22.780
Both: UGH!

02:22.880 --> 02:24.220
Mordecai: WHAT TIME IS IT?

02:24.320 --> 02:25.220
Rigby: IT'S 10:00.

02:25.320 --> 02:26.220
UGH!

02:26.320 --> 02:28.060
THAT'S LIKE FOUR MORE HOURS!

02:28.160 --> 02:28.740
( BOTH SLURP )

02:28.840 --> 02:29.500
Both: AHH!

02:29.600 --> 02:30.620
Mordecai: I STILL CAN'T

02:30.720 --> 02:34.240
BELIEVE BENSON IS MAKING US WAIT
UNTIL 2:00 TO SET THE CLOCKS

02:33.440 --> 02:33.820
BACK.

02:33.920 --> 02:36.560
Rigby: I KNOW!
HOW DOES IT EVEN MATTER IF THE

02:35.960 --> 02:39.120
CLOCKS ARE SET TO EXACTLY THE
RIGHT TIME?

02:37.760 --> 02:38.700
Mordecai: IT DOESN'T!

02:38.800 --> 02:41.840
HE ACTS LIKE HE'D BE ABLE TO
TELL THE DIFFERENCE IF THE

02:40.840 --> 02:43.800
CLOCKS WERE A LITTLE OFF.
HE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO TELL!

02:42.840 --> 02:44.340
Rigby: HE TOTALLY WOULDN'T BE

02:44.440 --> 02:47.000
ABLE TO TELL.
( BOTH SLURP )

02:45.720 --> 02:46.940
Both: AHH!

02:47.040 --> 02:48.540
Rigby: YOU KNOW WHAT, THOUGH?

02:48.640 --> 02:50.060
TECHNICALLY, WE AGREED TO SET

02:50.160 --> 02:53.600
ALL THE CLOCKS AT THE <i>SAMETIME,</i>
BUT WE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT

02:53.200 --> 02:56.600
SETTING THE CLOCKS TO THE <i>RIGHT</i>
TIME.

02:55.120 --> 02:58.200
Mordecai: WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING?

02:56.600 --> 02:57.900
Rigby: HOW 'BOUT WE DO WHAT

02:58.000 --> 03:01.160
BENSON SAYS AND SET ALL THE
CLOCKS BACK FOR DAYLIGHT SAVINGS

03:00.440 --> 03:03.880
BUT FIRST WE SET EVERY CLOCK IN
THE PARK TO THE SAME WRONG TIME,

03:03.160 --> 03:06.160
JUST TO SHOW BENSON AND
EVERYBODY ELSE THAT IT DOESN'T

03:05.520 --> 03:08.000
EVEN MATTER?!
Mordecai: HEH HEH. YEAH!

03:07.080 --> 03:08.300
WE'LL GO UP TO BENSON IN THE

03:08.400 --> 03:11.560
MIDDLE OF THE DAY TOMORROW AND
BE LIKE, "HEY, BENSON, ALL THE

03:10.720 --> 03:13.520
CLOCKS ARE WRONG.
YOU HAD NO IDEA, DID YOU?!"

03:12.960 --> 03:13.620
Rigby: HA HA!

03:13.720 --> 03:16.840
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE LOOK ON
HIS FACE WHEN WE TELL HIM.

03:15.840 --> 03:16.540
Mordecai: HA HA!

03:16.640 --> 03:19.760
MAN, THIS IS GONNA BE AWESOME.
Rigby: WHOO!

03:18.960 --> 03:19.980
DAYLIGHT SAVINGS!

03:20.080 --> 03:21.860
Mordecai: AH, COME ON, DUDE!

03:21.960 --> 03:23.340
I GOT TO WASH MY FACE NOW.

03:23.440 --> 03:25.260
( TICKING )

03:25.360 --> 03:26.220
Both: HEH HEH.

03:26.320 --> 03:27.740
HEH HEH. HEH HEH.

03:27.840 --> 03:28.700
HEH HEH.

03:28.800 --> 03:29.740
HEH HEH. HEH HEH.

03:29.840 --> 03:32.840
THIS IS THE CLOCK SONG
WE'RE SETTING ALL THE CLOCKS

03:31.920 --> 03:32.780
WRONG, HEHâHEH

03:32.880 --> 03:34.380
HEHâHEH HEHâHEH

03:35.360 --> 03:36.500
HEHâHEH HEHâHEH

03:36.600 --> 03:39.600
THIS IS THE CLOCK SONG
WE'RE SETTING ALL THE CLOCKS

WRONG, HEHâHEH

03:39.400 --> 03:40.620
HEHâHEH HEHâHEH

03:40.720 --> 03:41.460

03:41.560 --> 03:42.300
HEHâHEH HEHâHEH

03:42.400 --> 03:45.400
Mordecai:  BENSON'S ALL
ABOUT KEEPING TRACK OF TIME

03:45.120 --> 03:48.080
BUT 2:00 IN THE MORNING'S
WHERE WE DRAW THE LINE

03:47.360 --> 03:48.140
Both:  HEHâHEH

03:48.240 --> 03:49.220
HEHâHEH HEHâHEH

03:49.320 --> 03:50.260
HEHâHEH

03:50.360 --> 03:51.540
HEHâHEH HEHâHEH

03:51.640 --> 03:54.640
Rigby:  HE DOES EVERYTHING
TO KEEP YOU ON TRACK

03:53.280 --> 03:56.440
BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
'CAUSE THE DUDE IS WACK,

03:55.560 --> 03:56.500
WACK, WACK

03:56.600 --> 03:57.420
Both:  HEHâHEH

03:59.560 --> 04:00.740
HEHâHEH HEHâHEH

04:00.840 --> 04:03.760
THIS IS THE CLOCK SONG
WE'RE SETTING ALL THE CLOCKS

04:02.760 --> 04:03.580
WRONG, HEHâHEH

04:07.440 --> 04:10.480
Rigby: I THINK THAT'S EVERY
CLOCK IN THE PARK.

04:09.240 --> 04:12.240
Mordecai: HEH HEH. YEAH.
BENSON'S GONNA FEEL LIKE SUCH

04:11.400 --> 04:11.980
A ââ UH, WAIT.

04:12.080 --> 04:15.280
THIS ISN'T GONNA WORK UNLESS WE
CHANGE THE CLOCKS IN BENSON'S

04:14.600 --> 04:16.600
APARTMENT.

04:19.720 --> 04:20.500
Rigby: IT'S CLEAR.

04:20.600 --> 04:23.800
I'M PRETTY SURE BENSON KEEPS HIS
SPARE APARTMENT KEY IN HIS

04:22.840 --> 04:24.840
OFFICE.

04:30.080 --> 04:33.200

Mordecai: OKAY.

04:39.120 --> 04:40.660
THERE'S ONLY ONE MORE CLOCK IN

04:40.760 --> 04:41.380
THE HOUSE.

04:41.480 --> 04:42.820
MOMENT OF TRUTH ââ ARE WE BAD

04:42.920 --> 04:44.460
ENOUGH DUDES TO TEACH BENSON A

04:44.560 --> 04:47.240
LESSON?
Rigby: HECK, YEAH, WE ARE!

04:47.320 --> 04:48.300
Both: HMâHM!

04:48.400 --> 04:49.260

HUH?

05:02.800 --> 05:05.340
FINE. I'LL EAT AROUND IT, THEN.

05:05.440 --> 05:07.680
( SNORING )

05:11.200 --> 05:12.180
( BOTH LAUGH )

05:12.280 --> 05:13.500
Both: YES! WE DID IT!

05:13.600 --> 05:15.500
HA HA HA!

05:15.600 --> 05:18.220
Benson: SO, THE MOWER'S FINE.

05:18.320 --> 05:20.100
CART NEEDS NEW TIRES.

05:20.200 --> 05:22.140
ARE YOU TWO ACTUALLY THE FIRST

05:22.240 --> 05:23.020

05:23.120 --> 05:25.100
Mordecai: MM, YEAH, WE ARE.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.580
Rigby: WE FIGURED IT WAS

05:26.680 --> 05:30.080
ABOUT <i>TIMEWE STARTED ACTING</i>
RESPONSIBLY.

05:28.840 --> 05:29.900
Mordecai: ( CHUCKLES )

05:30.000 --> 05:30.900
Benson: WELL, GOOD.

05:35.800 --> 05:36.420
EVENTUALLY.

05:36.520 --> 05:37.940
Mordecai: HEHâHEH. YEAH.

05:38.040 --> 05:41.400
IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF <i>TIME.</i>
Both: HEE HEE HEE!

06:19.520 --> 06:20.180

06:20.280 --> 06:21.620
AND, COME TO THINK OF IT, IT'S

06:21.720 --> 06:23.180
ALARMINGLY HOT FOR 9:00 IN THE

SOMETHING'S NOT...QUITE...

06:27.080 --> 06:28.900
AAH! AAH!

06:29.000 --> 06:30.820

07:39.320 --> 07:40.860
