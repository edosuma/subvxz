- Welcome, welcome, welcome

00:32.500 --> 00:34.033
to "Last Week Tonight."

00:34.033 --> 00:35.200
I'm John Oliver.

00:35.200 --> 00:36.867
Thank you so much
for joining us.

00:36.867 --> 00:38.767
Just time for a quick recap
of the week,

00:38.767 --> 00:40.667
and we begin with
a narcissistic,

00:40.667 --> 00:43.000
unstable man who just
might kill us all,

00:43.000 --> 00:45.667
and it says something about
the current state of the world

00:45.667 --> 00:49.333
that you have no idea which
world leader our story is about.

00:49.333 --> 00:52.033
So, let me specify:
it's about a tubby,

00:52.033 --> 00:54.667
power-hungry leader with daddy
issues and a bad haircut,

00:54.667 --> 00:57.367
which still only narrows
us down to these two,

00:57.367 --> 01:01.200
but as it happens, our first
story is about both of them,

01:01.200 --> 01:03.433
because last week,
North Korea marked

01:03.433 --> 01:05.367
the 105th birthday
of Kim Il-Sung,

01:05.367 --> 01:07.934
their first supreme leader,
with a startling parade.

01:07.934 --> 01:10.467
- These canisters
could carry a missile

01:10.467 --> 01:12.700
capable of reaching the US,

01:12.700 --> 01:15.567
but are they real,
or are they what

01:15.567 --> 01:19.400
one intelligence official
called "just big green tubes."

01:19.400 --> 01:21.734
- Okay.
That is a good question.

01:21.734 --> 01:24.266
Because yes, on one hand,
they could be

01:24.266 --> 01:26.633
intercontinental missiles
capable of

01:26.633 --> 01:28.133
destabilizing
the whole world order.

01:28.133 --> 01:29.600
But on the other hand,
they could also be

01:29.600 --> 01:32.300
dildos for
the Jolly Green Giant's wife.

01:32.300 --> 01:34.200
He does not sexually
satisfy her.

01:34.200 --> 01:36.633
That's a fact.
That's a sad fact.

01:36.633 --> 01:40.133
But the parade wasn't the issue
for the international community

01:40.133 --> 01:42.100
as much as the missile test
that followed it,

01:42.100 --> 01:44.133
the fifth in the past ten weeks.

01:44.133 --> 01:46.767
And while it failed,
it was a provocative act,

01:46.767 --> 01:49.133
especially considering that
just days earlier,

01:49.133 --> 01:51.934
Donald Trump had tried to warn
them not to do it.

01:51.934 --> 01:54.967
- What are we doing right now
in terms of North Korea?

01:54.967 --> 01:58.567
- We are sending an armada.
Very powerful.

01:58.567 --> 02:00.834
We have submarines.

02:00.834 --> 02:03.066
Very powerful.

02:03.066 --> 02:04.367
- Okay.

02:04.367 --> 02:06.867
That was a very powerful
response from Trump.

02:06.867 --> 02:09.266
Very powerful.

02:09.266 --> 02:11.266
Although, I would argue
the most surprising thing

02:11.266 --> 02:13.834
there is that he knows
what the word "armada" means.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.734
I-I always just assumed
that's what

02:15.734 --> 02:17.567
he mistakenly called
his housekeepers.

02:17.567 --> 02:20.333
Armada, you forgot to dust
under the lamps.

02:20.333 --> 02:23.333
You think I don't check under
the lamps, Armada, but I do.

02:23.333 --> 02:25.700
I do check under the lamps.

02:25.700 --> 02:27.567
But to give the president
some credit,

02:27.567 --> 02:29.200
that was at least
a clear response,

02:29.200 --> 02:31.600
echoed later by Sean Spicer,
who argued that

02:31.600 --> 02:33.533
there was an unmistakable
message of deterrence

02:33.533 --> 02:35.767
being sent
"when you see a carrier group

02:35.767 --> 02:37.700
steaming into an area
like that."

02:37.700 --> 02:40.300
But that message got a little
muddied this week,

02:40.300 --> 02:41.867
after we learned
something surprising

02:41.867 --> 02:43.867
about the carrier group
in question.

02:43.867 --> 02:48.033
- The USS Carl Vinson
was not, in fact, on its way.

02:48.033 --> 02:51.533
It was more than 3,000
nautical miles away,

02:51.533 --> 02:55.600
traveling in the opposite
direction, heading south.

02:55.600 --> 02:59.767
- Okay, so it was steaming,
just the wrong way.

02:59.767 --> 03:02.200
And it was "off the coast
of North Korea" the same way

03:02.200 --> 03:05.133
that New York is off the coast
of Portugal.

03:05.133 --> 03:07.367
And when confronted
by this mistake,

03:07.367 --> 03:10.800
Sean Spicer--I remind you,
a professional spokesperson--

03:10.800 --> 03:13.934
yet again lost control
of his mouth.

03:13.934 --> 03:15.700
- Can you take us through
the events

03:15.700 --> 03:17.266
from the perspective
of the White House

03:17.266 --> 03:19.000
that led to
the miscommunication,

03:19.000 --> 03:21.300
this administration thinking
that this vessel

03:21.300 --> 03:23.867
was thousands of miles away from
its actual location?

03:23.867 --> 03:25.600
- The president said that
we have an armada

03:25.600 --> 03:27.700
going towards the peninsula.
That's a fact.

03:27.700 --> 03:29.867
It happened.
It is happening, rather.

03:29.867 --> 03:31.300
- Wait, wait, wait.
Wait.

03:31.300 --> 03:33.367
So Spicer is claiming that
because the fleet

03:33.367 --> 03:35.767
was going to North Korea
"eventually,"

03:35.767 --> 03:38.433
it was fine to suggest that
it was on its way there now.

03:38.433 --> 03:40.467
And by that logic,
I can truthfully say

03:40.467 --> 03:42.200
that Sean Spicer is currently

03:42.200 --> 03:44.467
posting his resume
on Monster.com.

03:44.467 --> 03:47.133
I mean, he isn't,
but he will eventually,

03:47.133 --> 03:50.467
and at this rate,
possibly as soon as next week.

03:50.467 --> 03:53.233
So it seems, with the parade of
potentially fake weapons,

03:53.233 --> 03:55.166
the failed missile test,
and the armada

03:55.166 --> 03:58.400
that's definitely in an ocean
steaming somewhere,

03:58.400 --> 04:01.000
it has been a week of confusing
messages back and forth.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.567
But on Wednesday, we got perhaps

04:02.567 --> 04:04.400
the most surprising message
of all.

04:04.400 --> 04:06.900
- "The New York Times"
reports on unusual activity

04:06.900 --> 04:08.967
at North Korea's
nuclear test site.

04:08.967 --> 04:12.066
Images taken Sunday showed
a volleyball game being played.

04:12.066 --> 04:13.800
It was one of three games.

04:13.800 --> 04:16.000
Analysts say the games
were probably intended

04:16.000 --> 04:20.367
to send a message,
but that message is unclear.

04:20.367 --> 04:23.233
- Yeah, yeah, it probably is,
because volleyball

04:23.233 --> 04:25.500
on a nuclear test site
is a pretty hard

04:25.500 --> 04:27.533
message to get your head around.

04:27.533 --> 04:29.967
It's like getting a text that
said, "Hey, you up?"

04:29.967 --> 04:31.500
eggplant emoji,
"cause I just ate

04:31.500 --> 04:34.333
an entire box of
graham crackers," gun emoji.

04:34.333 --> 04:35.667
I don't know what that means,

04:35.667 --> 04:38.633
but I'm pretty sure
it can't be good.

04:38.633 --> 04:40.800
For now,
let's move on to Turkey,

04:40.800 --> 04:42.467
a country that shares its name
with a bird,

04:42.467 --> 04:45.767
and not just any bird:
the hottest bird.

04:45.767 --> 04:49.166
Looking good, my friend.
Looking good.

04:49.166 --> 04:52.433
Now, we've talked before about
Turkish president Recep Erdogan,

04:52.433 --> 04:53.867
the mustachioed strongman

04:53.867 --> 04:57.033
who once got hoof-punched
in the dick by a horse.

04:57.033 --> 04:59.900
Well--well, he has been
attempting to consolidate

04:59.900 --> 05:02.433
his power for years,
and last Sunday,

05:02.433 --> 05:04.567
he took his boldest step yet.

05:04.567 --> 05:07.300
- President Erdogan
declared victory yesterday

05:07.300 --> 05:10.867
in a referendum that gives him
sweeping new powers.

05:10.867 --> 05:14.467
- His critics say this is a step
towards dictatorship.

05:14.467 --> 05:15.834
- Oh, that's great.

05:15.834 --> 05:17.367
I guess I can now add Turkey

05:17.367 --> 05:19.066
to my list of things
to worry about,

05:19.066 --> 05:21.367
along with America,
the French election,

05:21.367 --> 05:24.700
and whether John Cena is having
a happy 40th birthday today,

05:24.700 --> 05:28.967
and how the fuck John Cena and I
are the exact same age.

05:28.967 --> 05:31.233
Oh, my God.

05:31.233 --> 05:34.433
That is heartbreaking.

05:34.433 --> 05:36.266
But the point is--the point is,

05:36.266 --> 05:40.033
the power this referendum gives
Erdogan is sweeping.

05:40.033 --> 05:42.633
- Erdogan now has broad,
unchecked powers,

05:42.633 --> 05:44.834
and the authority to potentially

05:44.834 --> 05:47.767
remain in office until 2029.

05:47.767 --> 05:49.934
- It's true, the referendum
gives Erdogan the power

05:49.934 --> 05:52.600
to do pretty much everything,
short of building

05:52.600 --> 05:54.200
a statue of himself
with an erection

05:54.200 --> 05:57.066
that citizens will be forced to
give pretend hand jobs to.

05:57.066 --> 05:58.900
But to be honest, it might
actually have given him

05:58.900 --> 06:00.934
the power to do that as well.

06:00.934 --> 06:03.367
The legitimacy of the results
were immediately

06:03.367 --> 06:04.800
called into question
after "reports

06:04.800 --> 06:07.400
of voting irregularities,"
and European observers

06:07.400 --> 06:09.900
criticized the referendum,
saying it "took place

06:09.900 --> 06:11.667
on an unlevel playing field,"

06:11.667 --> 06:14.800
something that Erdogan
did not take well.

06:14.800 --> 06:18.667
- [speaking Turkish]

06:18.667 --> 06:21.266
- "What George, Hans,
or Helga say,

06:21.266 --> 06:23.667
that's not our problem,"
Erdogan said,

06:23.667 --> 06:25.600
mocking European
election monitors

06:25.600 --> 06:27.300
questioning the results.

06:27.300 --> 06:29.567
- Ouch, that is dismissive,

06:29.567 --> 06:31.734
especially since
"George, Hans, and Helga"

06:31.734 --> 06:34.767
sounds like a former East German
folk-rock group.

06:34.767 --> 06:37.066
"We are George, Hans, und Helga.

06:37.066 --> 06:39.266
"Prepare to have the sounds
of peace and love

06:39.266 --> 06:40.934
"administered promptly into

06:40.934 --> 06:44.567
your ears and brains,
meine freunde!"

06:44.567 --> 06:48.233
But this really does put America
in a very tricky situation.

06:48.233 --> 06:50.667
Turkey is a critical ally,
so any reaction

06:50.667 --> 06:52.967
to this referendum needed
to be handled delicately,

06:52.967 --> 06:55.800
and to his genuine credit,
Sean Spicer refused

06:55.800 --> 06:59.066
to issue a comment
on the contested results.

06:59.066 --> 07:01.433
- My understanding is there's
an international commission

07:01.433 --> 07:03.767
that is reviewing this
and issues a report,

07:03.767 --> 07:05.367
so 10 to 12 days, and so

07:05.367 --> 07:07.367
we'll wait and let them
do their job.

07:07.367 --> 07:08.934
- That is a good idea.

07:08.934 --> 07:10.834
Build the administration
a little time.

07:10.834 --> 07:13.633
Don't jump into the situation
without thinking through

07:13.633 --> 07:15.500
the complicated repur--

07:15.500 --> 07:18.100
you all know what's
coming now, right?

07:18.100 --> 07:19.900
- US President Donald Trump
has called

07:19.900 --> 07:22.066
Turkish President Recep Erdogan

07:22.066 --> 07:25.667
to congratulate him on
his narrow referendum triumph.

07:25.667 --> 07:28.767
- Yeah,
that happened the same day.

07:28.767 --> 07:31.133
And I guess at least it would
have been a fun call.

07:31.133 --> 07:33.900
"Oh, congratulations on narrowly
winning a vote that made you,

07:33.900 --> 07:35.700
"a divisive, egomaniacal bully,

07:35.700 --> 07:37.266
enormously powerful
in your country."

07:37.266 --> 07:39.000
"Thanks.
Same to you, Donald."

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
"Thanks.
Aren't we the worst?"

07:41.000 --> 07:43.200
"We are the worst.
Good-bye."

07:43.200 --> 07:44.667
"Bye-bye!"

07:44.667 --> 07:46.100
And think about it.

07:46.100 --> 07:47.500
'Cause here's the interesting
thing about this:

07:47.500 --> 07:50.834
why is Trump so eager to stay on
Erdogan's good side?

07:50.834 --> 07:52.834
Well, one explanation for that
actually comes from

07:52.834 --> 07:55.000
Trump himself in this interview
that he gave

07:55.000 --> 07:57.100
to Breitbart in 2015.

08:11.433 --> 08:12.800
- Of course.

08:12.800 --> 08:14.867
Of course to everything
you just heard.

08:14.867 --> 08:16.800
Of course there's
a conflict of interest.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.667
Of course it's caught on tape.

08:18.667 --> 08:21.800
Of course he pronounces it
"Istan-bool."

08:21.800 --> 08:23.734
And of course he has
a child-like surprise

08:23.734 --> 08:26.633
that towers can come in twos.

08:26.633 --> 08:28.667
And look, between his actions
regarding North Korea

08:28.667 --> 08:30.867
and Turkey this week,
World War III

08:30.867 --> 08:33.133
is beginning to feel
like Trump's armada:

08:33.133 --> 08:35.533
it's not here yet,
but it sure as shit

08:35.533 --> 08:37.233
feels like it's on its way.

08:37.233 --> 08:39.066
And now, this.

08:43.367 --> 08:44.767
- It is a violation--
- But you see--

08:47.433 --> 08:48.834

that you're wrong.

- Somebody tell me
where that's wrong.

08:50.367 --> 08:51.834

is that Democrats--

08:51.834 --> 08:54.767

09:48.867 --> 09:51.200
Go ahead, Senator.
- That's the way it works.

09:51.200 --> 09:52.967
[laughter]

09:52.967 --> 09:54.633
- Moving on.

09:54.633 --> 09:57.533
Our main story tonight
concerns the White House,

09:57.533 --> 09:59.200
the building inside which
Donald Trump--

09:59.200 --> 10:01.033
and I feel this isn't
mentioned enough--

10:01.033 --> 10:04.934
is regularly naked,
and just think about that.

10:04.934 --> 10:07.467
He might be naked
in there right now.

10:07.467 --> 10:09.767
Maybe he just sneezed.

10:09.767 --> 10:12.667
Maybe there's a BAND-AID
somewhere on his person.

10:12.667 --> 10:15.033
We don't know,
we just know that he's there,

10:15.033 --> 10:17.400
and we all have to
live with that.

10:17.400 --> 10:19.233
But while Trump himself
is divisive,

10:19.233 --> 10:21.734
there are two White House
figures who are widely admired:

10:21.734 --> 10:24.033
Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump.

10:24.033 --> 10:25.700
They're like America's
William and Kate,

10:25.700 --> 10:28.400
except in this case,
both of them are attractive.

10:28.400 --> 10:33.100
And--and many--many, many people
have praise for them.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.133
- The only adults in the room,

10:35.133 --> 10:37.633
the moderates, the centrists,
frankly Democrats,

10:37.633 --> 10:39.767
are Jared and Ivanka.
- Mm.

10:39.767 --> 10:43.400
- You know, thank God his kids
are, you know, there day to day.

10:43.400 --> 10:44.867
They're a positive
influence on him.

10:44.867 --> 10:46.900
- His best running mate,
by the way, would be Ivanka.

10:46.900 --> 10:49.667
I don't know that I've met
a more composed,

10:49.667 --> 10:53.000
brilliant,
beautiful in every way,

10:53.000 --> 10:54.667
uh, person.

10:54.667 --> 10:56.967
- Well, that is high praise from
Senator Bob Corker.

10:56.967 --> 10:59.667
"I've never met a more
brilliant, beautiful person."

10:59.667 --> 11:03.600
I imagine that went down great
with his wife and two daughters.

11:03.600 --> 11:08.400
"Happy Father's Day, Dad.
Did Ivanka send you anything?"

11:08.400 --> 11:11.166
But for liberals,
the popular assumption is that

11:11.166 --> 11:13.667
Jared and Ivanka will be
moderating influences.

11:13.667 --> 11:15.900
Basically, if Trump is thinking
about pressing a button

11:15.900 --> 11:19.400
labeled "Nuke Earth," they will,
on behalf of all of us,

11:19.400 --> 11:21.033
guide his hands
toward the button

11:21.033 --> 11:24.033
labeled "Hey...maybe don't."

11:24.033 --> 11:26.367
And they both have
official roles now.

11:26.367 --> 11:28.166
Ivanka has recently taken
an unpaid position

11:28.166 --> 11:31.166
as assistant to the president,
and as for Jared,

11:31.166 --> 11:34.333
well, he seems to have a hand
in basically everything.

11:34.333 --> 11:36.066
- He's been planning
this week's visit

11:36.066 --> 11:38.100
of the Chinese president
to Mar-a-Lago,

11:38.100 --> 11:39.700
and he's also tasked with

11:39.700 --> 11:41.667
brokering peace
in the Middle East.

11:41.667 --> 11:43.200
The president tapping
his son-in-law

11:43.200 --> 11:45.567
to reform the criminal
justice system,

11:45.567 --> 11:47.333
not to mention
he's running the new

11:47.333 --> 11:49.100
Office of American Innovation,

11:49.100 --> 11:52.133
where he's responsible for
reforming veteran care,

11:52.133 --> 11:54.333
tackling the opioid epidemic,

11:54.333 --> 11:57.033
and overseeing
the not-so-small feat

11:57.033 --> 12:00.367
of revamping the entire
federal government.

12:00.367 --> 12:02.333
- Holy shit.

12:02.333 --> 12:04.900
It is not unusual
for powerful men

12:04.900 --> 12:07.166
to give their son-in-laws
do-nothing jobs,

12:07.166 --> 12:08.700
but leave it to Donald Trump,

12:08.700 --> 12:10.834
who can't even get
nepotism right,

12:10.834 --> 12:13.867
to give his a do-everything job.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.700
So given the power
that they seem to hold,

12:15.700 --> 12:18.967
tonight, let's take a look
at Jared and Ivanka,

12:18.967 --> 12:20.967
and let's set aside
the questions surrounding

12:20.967 --> 12:22.667
potential conflicts
of interests between

12:22.667 --> 12:24.500
their business ties
and their positions

12:24.500 --> 12:26.033
in the administration,
and instead,

12:26.033 --> 12:28.934
let's focus on answering
just two basic questions:

12:28.934 --> 12:32.500
is Ivanka really the moderating
influence that people claim?

12:32.500 --> 12:34.266
And what in Jared's background

12:34.266 --> 12:37.533
justifies such a gigantic
White House portfolio?

12:37.533 --> 12:40.700
And let's start with Ivanka,
Trump's only daughter,

12:40.700 --> 12:43.834
except for, and yet somehow
including, Tiffany.

12:43.834 --> 12:47.300
Now, Ivanka is
reassuringly familiar,

12:47.300 --> 12:48.967
because she's been part of
the Trump brand

12:48.967 --> 12:50.367
since she was a child.

12:50.367 --> 12:51.767
She even co-hosted Trump's

12:51.767 --> 12:54.333
"Miss Teen USA" pageant
at age 15,

12:54.333 --> 12:57.767
featuring this noticeably
odd moment.

12:57.767 --> 13:00.633
- Let's go back to Ivanka.

13:00.633 --> 13:01.867
- Thanks, Eddie.

13:01.867 --> 13:03.967
I can guarantee my brothers
were loving that.

13:03.967 --> 13:06.633
Are any of you up there single?
[laughs]

13:06.633 --> 13:08.600
- Oh, God!

13:08.600 --> 13:10.867
Why did they have her say that?

13:10.867 --> 13:14.166
"Yes, Eddie, my blood relatives
are rock hard right now.

13:14.166 --> 13:16.600
"You heard me, the men with whom
I share parents

13:16.600 --> 13:19.266
probably have erect penises
at this very moment."

13:19.266 --> 13:22.300
[laughs shakily]

13:22.300 --> 13:25.233
But in the public drama
of the Trump family,

13:25.233 --> 13:28.133
Ivanka has been cast
as the calm, reasonable,

13:28.133 --> 13:30.533
indoor-voiced one,
a dynamic that's perhaps

13:30.533 --> 13:32.867
best exemplified
by this moment.

13:32.867 --> 13:36.000
- What's the favorite thing you
have in common with your father?

13:36.000 --> 13:38.934
- Either real estate or golf.

13:38.934 --> 13:41.033
- Donald, with your daughter?

13:41.033 --> 13:42.633
- Well, I was going to say sex,

13:42.633 --> 13:45.200
but I can't relate that to her.

13:45.200 --> 13:49.834
- What is wrong with you,
you colossal fucking creep?

13:49.834 --> 13:53.400
You found the only possible
wrong answer to that question.

13:53.400 --> 13:56.734
What's your favorite color?
"Hitler."

13:56.734 --> 13:59.400
But--but still.
That--that clip--

13:59.400 --> 14:01.567
that clip actually illustrates

14:01.567 --> 14:03.800
a lot of what
we like about Ivanka.

14:03.800 --> 14:06.033
She's the exact opposite
of her dad.

14:06.033 --> 14:09.100
He's crazy.
She's poised and restrained.

14:09.100 --> 14:12.100
And she is impressively
on-message at all times.

14:12.100 --> 14:13.700
Just think about
how little information

14:13.700 --> 14:15.467
she gave you in that exchange.

14:15.467 --> 14:18.433
She was asked, "What do you have
in common with your dad?"

14:18.433 --> 14:20.934
And she said
"real estate and golf."

14:20.934 --> 14:22.667
Those are not personal details.

14:22.667 --> 14:25.200
They are core components
of the Trump brand

14:25.200 --> 14:27.467
that any stranger would
associate with him.

14:27.467 --> 14:30.533
I mean, if you asked
Huey, Dewey, and Louie

14:30.533 --> 14:32.633
what they had in common
with their uncle Donald,

14:32.633 --> 14:35.400
and they said,
"Either feathers or no pants,"

14:35.400 --> 14:37.633
you would think,
"Wow, the Duck family

14:37.633 --> 14:40.467
really doesn't spend a lot of
quality time together."

14:40.467 --> 14:43.533
And that ability
to apparently say nothing

14:43.533 --> 14:46.300
and yet consistently
support her dad can actually

14:46.300 --> 14:48.900
apply to her political views,
as well.

14:48.900 --> 14:50.667
Because the assumption
that many of us have,

14:50.667 --> 14:54.100
that she disagrees with him,
isn't actually based on much.

14:54.100 --> 14:56.567
Just watch her response
to being questioned

14:56.567 --> 14:59.567
about what they specifically
disagree on.

14:59.567 --> 15:03.066
- My father agrees with me
on so many issues.

15:03.066 --> 15:05.867
And where he doesn't,
he knows where I stand.

15:05.867 --> 15:07.867
But it's not my administration.
- Can you give us an example

15:07.867 --> 15:10.066
of something that
you disagree with him on,

15:10.066 --> 15:12.600
and that you think that
by speaking up to him,

15:12.600 --> 15:15.767
it made him change his position
or soften his position?

15:15.767 --> 15:19.400
- I think
most of the impact I have,

15:19.400 --> 15:23.100
over time, most people will not
actually know about.

15:23.100 --> 15:24.767
- Oh, well, that's convenient.

15:24.767 --> 15:27.533
So we should just give her
credit when good stuff happens

15:27.533 --> 15:30.033
and then blame others
when bad stuff happens.

15:30.033 --> 15:32.734
That's not a job description
of a political adviser.

15:32.734 --> 15:35.900
That's a description of
an Old Testament God.

15:35.900 --> 15:38.867
And that answer there
enables you to project

15:38.867 --> 15:40.400
whatever you want onto her
based on

15:40.400 --> 15:42.433
second-hand rumors
and assumptions,

15:42.433 --> 15:46.500
which is exactly what Gayle King
and her co-hosts then did.

15:46.500 --> 15:48.100
- What is it they differ on?

15:48.100 --> 15:49.700
And where do you think she has--

15:49.700 --> 15:53.166
- She is not gonna share that
information--with me, anyway.

15:53.166 --> 15:54.633
She's not sharing
that information.

15:54.633 --> 15:56.834
She said that's between
her and her dad.

15:56.834 --> 15:58.066
- But what do you think?

15:58.066 --> 15:59.734
- I think about climate change,
certainly.

15:59.734 --> 16:00.967
I think about gay rights.

16:00.967 --> 16:03.233
I think some of
the immigration ban.

16:03.233 --> 16:04.433
- Planned Parenthood?

16:04.433 --> 16:06.200
- And certainly
Planned Parenthood.

16:06.200 --> 16:08.667
- Oh, yes, yes, certainly
Planned Parenthood, as well.

16:08.667 --> 16:10.400
Why not?
And you know, those things

16:10.400 --> 16:14.300
all feel true, but there is not
a lot of evidence.

16:14.300 --> 16:16.300
You know, it's the same way
that I assume

16:16.300 --> 16:18.266
Johnny Depp's penis also has

16:18.266 --> 16:20.600
its own miniature
hat and goatee.

16:20.600 --> 16:22.667
Now, I don't have any
concrete evidence

16:22.667 --> 16:25.900
that that is actually the case,
but come on.

16:25.900 --> 16:28.633
Probably, right?
Probably.

16:28.633 --> 16:31.133
And when you look at what
the Trump administration

16:31.133 --> 16:32.800
has been doing,
it is hard to see

16:32.800 --> 16:34.633
much of Ivanka's
influence there.

16:34.633 --> 16:38.133
Take Planned Parenthood, which
she "certainly" cares about.

16:38.133 --> 16:39.667
Well, last week, Donald Trump

16:39.667 --> 16:41.734
allowed states
to block funds to it.

16:41.734 --> 16:43.600
Or maybe take climate change.

16:43.600 --> 16:46.567
Ivanka did reportedly bring
Al Gore to Trump Tower.

16:46.567 --> 16:48.633
But unfortunately,
just three days later,

16:48.633 --> 16:50.900
Trump named climate change
denialist

16:50.900 --> 16:53.033
Scott Pruitt to head the EPA.

16:53.033 --> 16:56.867
And maybe that is an example of
Ivanka's moderating influence.

16:56.867 --> 16:59.300
Maybe Trump's initial choice was

16:59.300 --> 17:02.633
a guy strangling a dolphin
with a six-pack ring.

17:02.633 --> 17:05.867
Although, just out of interest,
let's look at an issue

17:05.867 --> 17:08.734
that Ivanka has been
very outspoken about.

17:08.734 --> 17:10.900
Last year at the RNC,
she brought up

17:10.900 --> 17:13.467
family leave and child care,
and when the Trump campaign

17:13.467 --> 17:16.166
released their plan for that,
she sold it hard.

17:16.166 --> 17:17.800
- We think
we've proposed something

17:17.800 --> 17:19.867
that's incredibly comprehensive.

17:19.867 --> 17:21.400
It's very innovative.

17:21.400 --> 17:23.200
It's a bold and fresh solution.

17:23.200 --> 17:26.066
There's no policy on
Hillary Clinton's website

17:26.066 --> 17:27.467
pertaining to any
of these issues.

17:27.467 --> 17:29.133
Child care, elder care,

17:29.133 --> 17:33.066
or maternity leave, or paternity
leave, for that matter.

17:33.066 --> 17:35.567
- Except none of that
was remotely true.

17:35.567 --> 17:38.900
First, of course Hillary's site
had pages on those issues,

17:38.900 --> 17:40.700
so it seems when it comes to
lying about

17:40.700 --> 17:43.266
easily observable facts,
the apple does not

17:43.266 --> 17:45.000
fall far from the orange.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.300
And--and let's--
let's take a look, though,

17:48.300 --> 17:50.500
at that comprehensive, bold,

17:50.500 --> 17:52.367
fresh Trump child care proposal,

17:52.367 --> 17:54.200
because according to
the Tax Policy Center,

17:54.200 --> 17:55.900
"very few" of its benefits

17:55.900 --> 17:57.767
went to
"the lowest income families."

17:57.767 --> 18:00.867
In fact, families with incomes
between $10,000 and $30,000

18:00.867 --> 18:05.500
would receive average benefits
of just $10 a year.

18:05.500 --> 18:09.600
And the only day care
that costs $10 is a padlock.

18:09.600 --> 18:11.967
Okay, okay,
Mommy's going to work,

18:11.967 --> 18:13.934
and Mrs. Master Lock
is gonna keep you

18:13.934 --> 18:16.200
in your bedroom
for the next eight hours.

18:16.200 --> 18:19.033
Thanks, Ivanka!
You're the best!

18:19.033 --> 18:22.000
And look,
you may still like Ivanka.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.800
That's fine.
She can be appealing.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.467
And that's frankly
not by accident.

18:25.467 --> 18:28.200
She's been trained in the art
of Trump branding

18:28.200 --> 18:30.333
to be as vague and likable
as possible

18:30.333 --> 18:32.533
so that everyone
can plausibly think

18:32.533 --> 18:34.834
that she shares their values,

18:34.834 --> 18:36.800
whether or not
that's actually true,

18:36.800 --> 18:39.200
and if that sounds like
a harsh thing

18:39.200 --> 18:40.967
for me to say about her,
I will point out

18:40.967 --> 18:44.300
she's basically shared that
message in one of her books.

19:02.200 --> 19:04.900
- She's pretty much telling you
to your face

19:04.900 --> 19:07.867
not to trust any assumption that
you are making about her.

19:07.867 --> 19:10.000
So it is possible
that she's doing

19:10.000 --> 19:12.967
nothing to moderate her father,
and I understand that

19:12.967 --> 19:16.200
there is an impulse not to want
to think about that.

19:16.200 --> 19:18.033
Just like you don't want to
think about the fact that

19:18.033 --> 19:21.100
it is also possible that in
the White House right now,

19:21.100 --> 19:24.033
her father may be bowling naked.

19:24.033 --> 19:26.600
Yeah, maybe he's wearing
bowling shoes.

19:26.600 --> 19:29.400
Maybe he's forcing Mike Pence
to play alongside him.

19:29.400 --> 19:31.767
We don't know.
We just have to deal with

19:31.767 --> 19:33.600
the fact that it's possible.

19:33.600 --> 19:35.900
But look, the truth is,
we may all be thinking

19:35.900 --> 19:38.333
that Ivanka is doing a lot more
than she actually is,

19:38.333 --> 19:40.934
although the same can
emphatically not be said

19:40.934 --> 19:43.900
for her husband, Jared Kushner,
the man--remember--

19:43.900 --> 19:45.633
responsible for,
among other things,

19:45.633 --> 19:48.867
repairing the Middle East,
something that his father-in-law

19:48.867 --> 19:50.934
is actually pretty confident in.

19:50.934 --> 19:53.533
- I have a feeling that Jared
is gonna do a great job.

19:53.533 --> 19:55.734
I have a feeling he's gonna...
[cheers and applause]

19:55.734 --> 19:57.133
He's gonna do a great job.

19:57.133 --> 20:00.100
He is so great.
If you can't produce peace

20:00.100 --> 20:02.867
in the Middle East, nobody can.

20:02.867 --> 20:05.500
- Okay, then nobody can.

20:05.500 --> 20:09.166
Or--or, I am wrong, and
future history books will say,

20:09.166 --> 20:11.433
"And peace was finally brought
to the Middle East

20:11.433 --> 20:15.400
by a sentient Kohl's mannequin
who read a book once."

20:15.400 --> 20:18.400
But Jared actually has
even more responsibility.

20:18.400 --> 20:21.166
He's also reportedly been
the primary point of contact

20:21.166 --> 20:23.367
for two dozen
different countries.

20:23.367 --> 20:25.533
And if you look at photos
of Trump's meetings,

20:25.533 --> 20:28.633
it's like "Where's Waldo?"
He's in all of them.

20:28.633 --> 20:31.433
When Trump met the leaders
of Congress, there he was.

20:31.433 --> 20:34.567
At a listening session with
business leaders, there he was.

20:34.567 --> 20:37.100
At a meeting on cyber security,
there he was.

20:37.100 --> 20:39.734
At a meeting with
a Saudi prince, there's Jared.

20:39.734 --> 20:42.567
Japanese prime minister?
Boom, it's J-dawg.

20:42.567 --> 20:44.333
Chinese president visiting?

20:44.333 --> 20:45.967
You got Kushner in the house.

20:45.967 --> 20:48.100
Discussing the airstrikes
on Syria?

20:48.100 --> 20:49.567
Where's the Kush?
Where's the Kush?

20:49.567 --> 20:52.266
There he is!
There's the Kush!

20:52.266 --> 20:54.667
Basically,
Jared is either being invited

20:54.667 --> 20:56.266
to every important meeting,

20:56.266 --> 20:59.033
or he died in the White House
in the late 1800s,

20:59.033 --> 21:02.533
and he's been haunting it
ever since.

21:02.533 --> 21:05.133
Jared's portfolio
would be unmanageable

21:05.133 --> 21:06.934
for the smartest man on Earth.

21:06.934 --> 21:11.266
So, is Jared Kushner
the smartest man on Earth?

21:11.266 --> 21:13.533
We already know that
he's the coolest.

21:13.533 --> 21:16.567
He can really rock
a trill pair of sunnies.

21:16.567 --> 21:19.266
But what is going on
behind them?

21:19.266 --> 21:21.667
- This guy can be quiet
but confident,

21:21.667 --> 21:24.166
and as it was described to me,
he is a visionary.

21:24.166 --> 21:28.000
- If you have meetings with
Jared Kushner, Jared listens.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.166
He doesn't talk that much.
He absorbs it.

21:31.166 --> 21:33.633
- I see Jared as like
the Alexander Hamilton

21:33.633 --> 21:35.533
of the new administration.

21:35.533 --> 21:37.300
He's super thoughtful.
- Okay.

21:37.300 --> 21:40.533
- He's a--he's a--he's a
three-times listener,

21:40.533 --> 21:43.000
0.5% talker.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.367
- Stop.

21:44.367 --> 21:47.433
So hold on, he is brilliant
because he's quiet?

21:47.433 --> 21:49.567
Just because you don't talk
does not necessarily

21:49.567 --> 21:51.567
mean you're thinking
something amazing.

21:51.567 --> 21:53.700
It can just mean that
you're sitting in a meeting,

21:53.700 --> 21:55.834
staring blankly at
peoples' moving lips,

21:55.834 --> 21:59.700
thinking about why baby cats
aren't called "cattens."

21:59.700 --> 22:02.433
Or whether all goldfish might
have peanut allergies,

22:02.433 --> 22:04.433
but since they don't ever
eat peanuts,

22:04.433 --> 22:07.333
we'll just never know.

22:07.333 --> 22:10.400
And that whole
"0.5% talker" thing

22:10.400 --> 22:12.533
does point to something
genuinely odd about Jared,

22:12.533 --> 22:15.200
because for someone with
the amount of power that he has,

22:15.200 --> 22:17.400
have you ever heard him speak?

22:17.400 --> 22:21.233
Seriously, what does
his voice sound like?

22:21.233 --> 22:23.433
You don't know, do you?
And look, it wasn't easy,

22:23.433 --> 22:25.900
but we did actually manage to
find an interview of him

22:25.900 --> 22:29.433
talking on TV in 2009,
and here it is.

22:29.433 --> 22:31.433
- [Gilbert Gottfried] My main
business is real estate,

22:31.433 --> 22:33.400
and I also own a newspaper
and some other

22:33.400 --> 22:36.200
websites and online
media businesses.

22:36.200 --> 22:38.033
[laughter]

22:38.033 --> 22:40.200
- Yeah.
Yeah, I know, I know.

22:40.200 --> 22:42.333
I know.
I know what you're thinking.

22:42.333 --> 22:44.834
You're thinking, "Hold on,
you just took that clip

22:44.834 --> 22:46.367
and you dubbed
in Gilbert Gottfried,"

22:46.367 --> 22:48.667
but you don't know that
for sure.

22:48.667 --> 22:50.367
Listen to it again.

22:50.367 --> 22:52.300
- [Gilbert Gottfried] My main
business is real estate,

22:52.300 --> 22:54.367
and I also own a newspaper
and some other

22:54.367 --> 22:56.767
websites and online
media businesses.

22:56.767 --> 22:58.633
- You don't know for a fact

22:58.633 --> 23:00.567
that that is not
his actual voice.

23:00.567 --> 23:03.033
And that is the real point.

23:03.033 --> 23:05.767
So in the absence of
Jared's spoken thoughts,

23:05.767 --> 23:08.233
we've instead had to rely on
second-hand evidence

23:08.233 --> 23:09.967
of his brilliance,
and the first thing

23:09.967 --> 23:12.500
many people cite
is his education.

23:12.500 --> 23:15.767
- Jared is a great young man.
Went to Harvard, very smart.

23:15.767 --> 23:17.633
- He want to Harvard.
- Jared is a very--

23:17.633 --> 23:20.567
he's a number one
at Harvard guy.

23:20.567 --> 23:22.667
He's incredibly smart.

23:22.667 --> 23:25.433
- Yes, but that's not really
evidence of anything.

23:25.433 --> 23:27.433
The Unabomber went to Harvard.

23:27.433 --> 23:29.500
Ted Cruz went to Harvard.

23:29.500 --> 23:32.233
And yes, plenty of smart people
went there too.

23:32.233 --> 23:33.900
They'll tell you about it.

23:33.900 --> 23:36.600
But it is worth--
it is worth noting

23:36.600 --> 23:38.734
that officials at
Jared's high school

23:38.734 --> 23:41.100
were reportedly dismayed
he got in

23:41.100 --> 23:44.166
because, as one put it,
"His GPA did not warrant it,

23:44.166 --> 23:46.567
his SAT scores
did not warrant it."

23:46.567 --> 23:48.300
So who knows
how he pulled that off?

23:48.300 --> 23:50.333
I'm sure it's absolutely nothing
to do with the fact

23:50.333 --> 23:53.567
that his father pledged
$2.5 million to the school

23:53.567 --> 23:56.900
shortly before he was admitted,
and I am certainly not saying

23:56.900 --> 23:59.567
that that is a textbook case
of paying for admission.

23:59.567 --> 24:02.400
I'll leave that to the textbook
"The Price of Admission,"

24:02.400 --> 24:04.600
in which that story
actually appears.

24:04.600 --> 24:07.633
But--but the point is,
however Jared got in,

24:07.633 --> 24:09.400
after graduating, he took over

24:09.400 --> 24:10.934
his father's
real estate business

24:10.934 --> 24:12.934
after his dad Charlie
was sent to prison,

24:12.934 --> 24:15.300
and I don't have time
to get into why.

24:15.300 --> 24:17.867
Let me just say it involves
blackmailing his brother-in-law,

24:17.867 --> 24:20.800
a sex worker, and a hidden
camera in an alarm clock

24:20.800 --> 24:22.767
in a shitbox motel on Route 22

24:22.767 --> 24:24.867
called the Red Bull--
the Red Bull Inn.

24:24.867 --> 24:26.934
The whole story,
I promise, is amazing.

24:26.934 --> 24:28.500
Trust me, it is worth a Google.

24:28.500 --> 24:31.667
You're gonna need
the SafeSearch off.

24:31.667 --> 24:35.633
But--but how has Jared
run the family business?

24:35.633 --> 24:39.166
Well, he made a big splash
when he bought 666 5th Avenue

24:39.166 --> 24:42.533
for a record $1.8 billion
in 2007,

24:42.533 --> 24:45.700
but that deal has not been
a raging success.

24:45.700 --> 24:48.467
- The entire deal
was a miscalculation.

24:48.467 --> 24:50.867
- They absolutely paid
too much at the time.

24:50.867 --> 24:52.633
He bought at the very top
of the market,

24:52.633 --> 24:54.300
so then the market turned.

24:54.300 --> 24:56.200
- Ten years later,
the building is struggling

24:56.200 --> 24:58.133
to cover its debt payments.

24:58.133 --> 25:00.700
- Okay, so Kushner's purchase
did make a splash,

25:00.700 --> 25:02.567
but it turned out to be more
the kind of splash

25:02.567 --> 25:05.166
your phone makes when it falls
into the toilet.

25:05.166 --> 25:06.867
Now,
that building is obviously not

25:06.867 --> 25:08.667
Jared's whole record
in business.

25:08.667 --> 25:10.467
He also owned
the "New York Observer,"

25:10.467 --> 25:12.367
which even the paper's staff
found a little odd,

25:12.367 --> 25:14.133
given that several people
described him as

25:14.133 --> 25:16.567
an "unenthusiastic reader,
with little use

25:16.567 --> 25:18.734
for newspapers,
let alone books."

25:18.734 --> 25:20.467
He also recently spearheaded

25:20.467 --> 25:22.667
a Brooklyn development
called Dumbo Heights.

25:22.667 --> 25:24.867
And one of his partners
praised his involvement there,

25:24.867 --> 25:27.567
saying, "He's very uncluttered
in his mind.

25:27.567 --> 25:29.066
"I think that simplicity

25:29.066 --> 25:31.133
allows him to filter
some things out."

25:31.133 --> 25:35.333
Which could be a compliment
or a savage insult.

25:35.333 --> 25:36.800
And to give you a flavor

25:36.800 --> 25:39.033
of what Jared's vision
for Dumbo Heights is,

25:39.033 --> 25:40.700
I'd like you to watch a video
that he showed

25:40.700 --> 25:42.867
to a real estate conference
which is the most

25:42.867 --> 25:46.300
infuriating combination of
meaningless tech nonsense

25:46.300 --> 25:49.367
and stock footage of models
pretending to conduct business

25:49.367 --> 25:51.367
that you will ever see.

25:51.367 --> 25:53.800
- Dumbo Heights:
a dynamic space

25:53.800 --> 25:56.266
mechanically engineered
for optimum performance

25:56.266 --> 25:58.166
and unrivaled connectivity.

25:58.166 --> 26:00.133
This campus is
the staging ground

26:00.133 --> 26:02.200
for the next generation
of innovators

26:02.200 --> 26:04.200
and creators.

26:04.200 --> 26:05.967
Change is forged on this campus

26:05.967 --> 26:09.900
in the fire of great thinkers
and visionaries.

26:09.900 --> 26:13.300
A community built
for collaboration.

26:13.300 --> 26:15.100
When innovation is cultivated,

26:15.100 --> 26:17.633
the world rises to meet.

26:17.633 --> 26:19.533
- Dope.

26:19.533 --> 26:21.667
You know, it's hard to pick--
it's hard to pick,

26:21.667 --> 26:23.834
but I think my favorite
phrase in there is actually

26:23.834 --> 26:27.367
bragging that the development is
"mechanically engineered."

26:27.367 --> 26:30.066
Because what are
the other options there?

26:30.066 --> 26:32.600
How many office buildings
are naturally occurring,

26:32.600 --> 26:36.200
or created with a wish
on a genie's lamp?

26:36.200 --> 26:37.734
And if you are starting
to get concerned

26:37.734 --> 26:40.066
that Jared's business record
may not qualify him

26:40.066 --> 26:41.867
for his current jobs,
I should point out

26:41.867 --> 26:44.333
one other prominent item
that is on his resume:

26:44.333 --> 26:46.333
the 2016 election.

26:46.333 --> 26:49.300
A few weeks after it was over,
"Forbes" ran a cover story

26:49.300 --> 26:52.100
titled
"This Guy Got Trump Elected,"

26:52.100 --> 26:54.867
which does sound impressive, and
it features quotes from Jared

26:54.867 --> 26:58.033
like, "We played Moneyball,
asking ourselves which states

26:58.033 --> 27:00.734
will get the best ROI
for the electoral vote,"

27:00.734 --> 27:02.400
which is a sentence
that can only be forged

27:02.400 --> 27:07.233
in the uncluttered mind of
the wizard of Dumbo Heights.

27:07.233 --> 27:09.900
But in fairness, the article
does give some examples

27:09.900 --> 27:11.934
of what specific
technical expertise

27:11.934 --> 27:14.300
Jared may have brought
into the operation.

27:14.300 --> 27:16.900
- They used targeting.
They found a way to get people

27:16.900 --> 27:18.166
on Facebook and Twitter.

27:18.166 --> 27:20.100
They evolved into this
100-person

27:20.100 --> 27:22.567
secret data center
down in San Antonio,

27:22.567 --> 27:24.100
and they had data do everything.

27:24.100 --> 27:27.100
Data determined his schedule,
his rallies,

27:27.100 --> 27:28.867
even what he spoke about
in the rallies, so they knew--

27:28.867 --> 27:30.467
- Even what he spoke about
at the rallies?

27:30.467 --> 27:32.166
- Yes.
- Really?

27:32.166 --> 27:35.433
Data determined what Trump
spoke about at his rallies?

27:35.433 --> 27:37.400
Look, I don't doubt that
there were 100 people

27:37.400 --> 27:40.500
in a basement somewhere
Moneyballing the ROI,

27:40.500 --> 27:44.767
but I would love to see the data
that recommended this.

27:44.767 --> 27:47.133
- I love these boards.
Look, here's a beauty.

27:47.133 --> 27:49.333
Here's a beauty.
I just--I love charts.

27:49.333 --> 27:51.066
I love charts.

27:51.066 --> 27:52.667
And I always said, you know,
it's too tough

27:52.667 --> 27:54.233
putting a screen up,
you got to get guys,

27:54.233 --> 27:57.700
costs too much money--
I don't like to spend money.

27:57.700 --> 27:59.533
This is a cheap version
of a screen, okay?

27:59.533 --> 28:01.667
It's just as good.

28:01.667 --> 28:04.033
But you need good, strong hands.

28:04.033 --> 28:07.200
So look, you ready?

28:07.200 --> 28:08.934
So there it is.

28:08.934 --> 28:10.600
- Thanks, Jared.

28:10.600 --> 28:12.266
You really
mechanically engineered

28:12.266 --> 28:13.834
the shit out of that one.

28:13.834 --> 28:17.000
But you know what?
Trump did win the election.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.700
And I wasn't there,
so who knows?

28:18.700 --> 28:20.734
Maybe Jared is single-handedly

28:20.734 --> 28:22.700
responsible for
the entire victory.

28:22.700 --> 28:25.467
But that still doesn't mean
he has the specific knowledge

28:25.467 --> 28:27.867
to tackle government reform,
or the Middle East,

28:27.867 --> 28:29.700
or the opioids epidemic.

28:29.700 --> 28:33.166
Can somebody please reassure me
that this is okay?

28:33.166 --> 28:36.367
- Jared is incredibly smart,

28:36.367 --> 28:39.033
very talented,
has enormous capacity.

28:39.033 --> 28:42.467
He is humble in the recognition

28:42.467 --> 28:44.967
of what he doesn't know,

28:44.967 --> 28:47.767
and is tremendously secure

28:47.767 --> 28:53.400
in his ability to--
to seek informed viewpoints.

28:53.400 --> 28:55.834
- No, not you.
Not you.

28:55.834 --> 28:58.066
I know your game now.
Not you.

28:58.066 --> 29:01.100
And also, to that point that he
will seek informed viewpoints,

29:01.100 --> 29:03.900
that will be harder
since there are still hundreds

29:03.900 --> 29:05.834
of key jobs
across the government

29:05.834 --> 29:08.000
that Trump has not yet
named nominees for,

29:08.000 --> 29:10.200
some at agencies central
to Jared's duties,

29:10.200 --> 29:12.200
including the Department
of Transportation,

29:12.200 --> 29:14.834
the DEA, and the VA.

29:14.834 --> 29:17.300
It is too bad that Trump
can't appoint someone

29:17.300 --> 29:19.133
to nominate people
on his behalf,

29:19.133 --> 29:20.700
although even then,
I am pretty sure

29:20.700 --> 29:24.300
that he'd give that job
to Jared fucking Kushner.

29:24.300 --> 29:26.233
And yet, the truth is,
for many people,

29:26.233 --> 29:28.667
the main thing qualifying Jared
for his positions

29:28.667 --> 29:31.800
is not so much who he is,
but who he isn't.

29:31.800 --> 29:34.200
- As many questions as I have
about Jared and Ivanka

29:34.200 --> 29:37.000
and their qualifications,
they're a lot more qualified

29:37.000 --> 29:38.533
than people like Steve Bannon.

29:38.533 --> 29:40.700
- I, like everybody,
would prefer to have them

29:40.700 --> 29:43.967
rather than Mr. Bannon
involved in decisions.

29:43.967 --> 29:45.800
- Is he James Baker?
No, he's not James Baker.

29:45.800 --> 29:47.867
- The answer's no.
- But is he Steve Bannon?

29:47.867 --> 29:49.567
No, he's not Steve Bannon.

29:49.567 --> 29:50.867
- All right, that is true.

29:50.867 --> 29:52.800
Jared Kushner is not
Steve Bannon,

29:52.800 --> 29:55.100
but that is a low bar.

29:55.100 --> 29:58.367
That recommendation would
get you no other job.

29:58.367 --> 30:00.934
We shouldn't be excited about
a top White House adviser

30:00.934 --> 30:04.000
simply because he is preferable
to a man best described as

30:04.000 --> 30:06.600
every dark thought humanity
has ever had,

30:06.600 --> 30:09.300
inhabiting the long-dead corpse
of a Civil War-era

30:09.300 --> 30:11.633
plantation owner
that even his fellow

30:11.633 --> 30:15.567
plantation owners called
"a bit much."

30:15.567 --> 30:19.200
There has to be a third option
here, and even some people

30:19.200 --> 30:23.667
who know Jared and like him
have some serious questions.

30:23.667 --> 30:25.467
- I know Jared Kushner
and Ivanka.

30:25.467 --> 30:28.000
They lived in my building.
They're lovely young people.

30:28.000 --> 30:31.266
Does this person have
any qualifications?

30:31.266 --> 30:33.600
Lovely guy.
I'm sure level-headed.

30:33.600 --> 30:35.500
Yes, he's temperamentally sane,

30:35.500 --> 30:37.000
versus the president, got it.

30:37.000 --> 30:40.433
Having said that, what has
this guy done in his life ever?

30:40.433 --> 30:42.467
- Just listen to what
he just said.

30:42.467 --> 30:45.834
Lovely young man, seems
level-headed, what's he done?

30:45.834 --> 30:48.100
It does not bode well that
Jared Kushner's neighbors

30:48.100 --> 30:49.700
describe him like
he just got arrested

30:49.700 --> 30:51.800
for murdering 11 people.

30:51.800 --> 30:54.934
And look, in the end,
this isn't even Jared's fault.

30:54.934 --> 30:57.300
It's the fault of the guy
who appointed him.

30:57.300 --> 30:59.200
Because think about it this way:

30:59.200 --> 31:02.667
imagine anyone other than
Donald Trump was president.

31:02.667 --> 31:04.333
And hold that thought.

31:04.333 --> 31:06.433
It's nice, right?

31:06.433 --> 31:08.433
In fact--in fact, imagine--

31:08.433 --> 31:11.033
imagine this stock photo guy
was in office.

31:11.033 --> 31:14.467
This guy, and he said,
"Hey, everyone, I'm gonna fix

31:14.467 --> 31:16.400
"the Middle East, and opioids,

31:16.400 --> 31:18.367
"and the whole of government
in general,

31:18.367 --> 31:20.266
"and I've found
the perfect person to do it.

31:20.266 --> 31:23.800
"It's this creepily silent
36-year-old

31:23.800 --> 31:25.433
"heir to a real estate fortune.

31:25.433 --> 31:27.233
What does everyone think?"

31:27.233 --> 31:30.800
You would justifiably be
fucking upset at that.

31:30.800 --> 31:32.600
And I know that all of this
may seem like

31:32.600 --> 31:35.567
an evisceration of
both Jared and Ivanka,

31:35.567 --> 31:37.500
but it is really not.

31:37.500 --> 31:40.567
I don't know enough about them
to eviscerate them,

31:40.567 --> 31:42.800
just as you don't know
enough about them

31:42.800 --> 31:45.400
to justify putting
any real hopes in them.

31:45.400 --> 31:47.533
Because it is dangerous
to think of them

31:47.533 --> 31:50.967
as a moderating influence,
as reassuring as that may feel,

31:50.967 --> 31:53.900
because believe me--and it gives
me no pleasure to say this--

31:53.900 --> 31:56.900
if they are the reason
you are sleeping at night,

31:56.900 --> 32:00.066
you should probably
still be awake.

32:00.066 --> 32:02.834
And if you need help doing that,
simply remember,

32:02.834 --> 32:06.233
Donald Trump may currently be
airing out his balls

32:06.233 --> 32:08.166
in the Lincoln Bedroom.

32:08.166 --> 32:09.934
Sweet dreams.

32:09.934 --> 32:11.633

32:16.166 --> 32:18.667
- I'm sexist.
I'm a bigot.

32:18.667 --> 32:20.033
I'm a racist.
- Oh.

32:20.033 --> 32:22.133
- Look, let's just get it
on the table.

32:22.133 --> 32:24.533
I'm everything.
Racist, sexist,

32:24.533 --> 32:27.767
or any other "ist"
the far left embraces.

32:27.767 --> 32:29.667
They're gonna point at people,
"You're a racist,

32:29.667 --> 32:31.967
"you're a sexist,
you made me uncomfortable.

32:31.967 --> 32:33.633
You did this, you did that."

32:33.633 --> 32:35.133
What about this sexism thing?

32:35.133 --> 32:36.600
I don't really know
what this is.

32:36.600 --> 32:38.300
Now, just the fact that I said
"va-va-voom"

32:38.300 --> 32:39.900
make me a sexist, right?
- No, it doesn't.

32:39.900 --> 32:41.166
- It doesn't?
Are you sure?

32:41.166 --> 32:43.033
I wanted two ladies on here.
- Yeah.

32:43.033 --> 32:44.800
- 'Cause I know I'm insensitive.

32:44.800 --> 32:48.100
Now, you guys are both, uh,
um, female.

32:48.100 --> 32:52.333
There's got to be some downside
to having a woman president.

32:52.333 --> 32:53.800
Right?
Something.

32:53.800 --> 32:57.433
Something that may not fit
with that office.

32:57.433 --> 33:00.100
Many women who get pregnant are
blasted out of their minds

33:00.100 --> 33:02.433
when they have sex--they're not
gonna use birth control anyway.

33:02.433 --> 33:03.834
Maria, when you hear me
try to talk,

33:03.834 --> 33:04.900
that means you have
to button it up.

33:04.900 --> 33:06.367
You know,
you're snorting out there,

33:06.367 --> 33:08.066
and I want you to knock it off.
- I'm not snorting.

33:08.066 --> 33:10.200
- Now, if you were men, I would
have scolded you harder.

33:10.200 --> 33:11.667

to be treated equally.

All right, ladies, good debate.
We're not mad at you, Kirsten.

33:29.734 --> 33:32.533
I'm sorry if I mischaracterized
what you were doing, all right?

33:32.533 --> 33:34.834
- Mm-hmm.
- Want respect for everyone.

favorable treatment in this
country because you are white.

33:44.867 --> 33:48.266
The white establishment
is now the minority.

33:48.266 --> 33:51.266
The race hustlers
blame white privilege.

33:51.266 --> 33:53.700
You can't be blaming
the white people for everything.

33:53.700 --> 33:55.867
It's ridiculous.
There's no white privilege.

33:55.867 --> 33:57.700
There must be Asian privilege.

33:57.700 --> 34:00.100
Because the Asians are at
the top of the chart.

34:00.100 --> 34:02.934
And the African-Americans are at
the bottom of the chart.

34:02.934 --> 34:04.767

to do with slavery.
