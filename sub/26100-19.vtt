Good evening, and thank you for coming.

36:51.060 --> 36:52.670
Okay, well, now would be a good time

36:52.680 --> 36:54.840
to tell us how we're going
to steal the God Account.

36:54.850 --> 36:55.860
Pretty simple, actually.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.539
So Simon is gonna take

36:57.540 --> 36:59.539
the God Account off
of his secure servers

36:59.540 --> 37:00.560
in Palo Alto

37:00.570 --> 37:02.080
and transfer them to his computer,

37:02.090 --> 37:03.749
and when he does,

37:03.750 --> 37:05.280
I'm gonna intercept it.

37:05.360 --> 37:06.660
And why would he ever take

37:06.670 --> 37:08.350
the God Account code off of his servers?

37:08.360 --> 37:09.679
He wouldn't,

37:09.680 --> 37:11.580
unless he felt like his
system was under attack

37:11.600 --> 37:13.220
and the God Account
risked being destroyed.

37:13.240 --> 37:16.089
In that case, well, he's got no choice.

37:16.090 --> 37:18.029
So that's why you warned him about Pria.

37:18.030 --> 37:19.699
- You were setting him up.
- Mm-hmm.

37:19.700 --> 37:21.020
I needed him to be ready

37:21.040 --> 37:22.969
so now, when Pria attacks,

37:22.970 --> 37:24.299
Simon's gonna think he's transferring

37:24.300 --> 37:25.379
the God Account to his computer,

37:25.380 --> 37:26.660
where he can run it manually.

37:26.670 --> 37:28.200
Only we're gonna get it before.

37:28.260 --> 37:29.369
Exactly.

37:29.370 --> 37:31.680
For centuries, humanity has had
