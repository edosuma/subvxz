04:57.130 --> 04:58.712
Mr. Beaumont?

04:59.508 --> 05:01.795
Your son Jeffrey's here to see you.

05:03.386 --> 05:05.298
<i>7894.</i>

05:13.688 --> 05:15.224
Hey, Dad.

07:10.263 --> 07:13.882
Um, do you have a Detective Williams
still working here?

07:13.975 --> 07:18.185
Yes, he's up in Room 221.
Right up the stairs, through that door.

07:18.271 --> 07:19.557
Thanks.

07:35.080 --> 07:36.161
Detective Williams?

07:42.587 --> 07:43.748
Yes?

07:43.838 --> 07:46.296
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont.
I live near you.

07:46.383 --> 07:48.249
I believe you know my father,
Tom Beaumont?

07:48.343 --> 07:49.550
Beaumont's Hardware Store?

07:49.636 --> 07:53.175
Sure, I do. I understand he's
in the hospital. How's he doing?

07:53.264 --> 07:56.177
He's okay, I guess. I hope.

07:56.267 --> 07:58.634
They're doing tests.
That's why I'm home from school.

07:58.728 --> 08:01.499
Anyway, I was at the hospital this morning,
and coming home through the field,

08:01.523 --> 08:04.391
behind our neighborhood,
there behind Vista,

08:04.484 --> 08:07.852
I, uh... found an ear.

08:07.946 --> 08:10.780
You did? A human ear?

08:10.865 --> 08:13.573
Yeah. I thought I should bring it to you.

08:13.660 --> 08:16.073
Yeah, that's right.
Let's take a look at it.

08:21.042 --> 08:23.329
Yes, that's a human ear, all right.

08:24.504 --> 08:27.149
Let's take it down to the coroner's office
and see what they make of it.

08:27.173 --> 08:30.007
Then I want you to show me
exactly where you found it.

08:30.093 --> 08:31.379
All right.

08:34.054 --> 08:35.761
We'll check the morgue records,

08:35.849 --> 08:38.216
but I don't recall anything coming in
minus an ear.

08:38.727 --> 08:41.640
The person may very well
still be alive somewhere.

08:41.730 --> 08:44.188
What can you tell about the person
from the ear?

08:44.274 --> 08:47.517
Well, once the tests are done,
quite a lot.

08:47.610 --> 08:50.944
Sex, blood type, whether or not
the ear came off a dead person.

08:51.740 --> 08:55.700
Also, it looks like the ear
was cut off with scissors.

09:26.024 --> 09:28.641
- I'm goin' out for a while.
- Do you want the car?

09:28.735 --> 09:31.148
- No, I'm just gonna walk around.
- All right.

09:31.237 --> 09:33.729
Oh, Jeffrey, you're not going
down by Lincoln, are you?

09:33.823 --> 09:36.907
No, I'm just gonna walk around
the neighborhood. Don't worry.

09:38.453 --> 09:39.453
Okay, honey.

10:52.902 --> 10:55.770
Hello. My name is Jeffrey Beaumont.

10:55.864 --> 10:57.355
Is Detective Williams here?

10:57.448 --> 11:00.031
Oh, yes. Yes, Jeffrey, come on in.

11:00.118 --> 11:01.609
Thanks.

11:07.458 --> 11:11.498
Well, now, Jeffrey, you found
something which is very interesting to us.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.079
Very interesting.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.165
I know you must be curious to know more.

11:16.217 --> 11:20.302
But I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you
not only not to tell anybody about your find,

11:20.388 --> 11:23.472
but also not to ask more about the case.

11:23.558 --> 11:26.471
One day when it's all sewed up,

11:26.561 --> 11:28.928
I'll let you know all the details.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.139
Right now, though, I can't.

11:31.232 --> 11:32.848
I understand.

11:32.942 --> 11:36.185
I'm just real curious, like you said.

11:36.279 --> 11:38.817
I was the same way myself
when I was your age.

11:40.491 --> 11:42.778
I guess that's what got me
into this business.

11:42.869 --> 11:45.031
Must be great.

11:45.121 --> 11:46.953
It's horrible too.

11:48.541 --> 11:51.579
I'm sorry, Jeffrey.
That's the way it has to be.

11:51.669 --> 11:55.003
Anyway, I know you do understand.

11:55.089 --> 11:56.089
Sure.

12:00.303 --> 12:02.465
- Thanks for the card for my dad.
- Oh, you're welcome.

12:02.555 --> 12:05.468
- It was nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
- You too.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.082
- Say hello to Sandy for me.
- We will.

12:11.147 --> 12:12.147
Okay.

12:13.107 --> 12:14.689
Good night, Jeffrey.

12:14.776 --> 12:16.438
Good night, Detective Williams.

12:29.207 --> 12:31.494
Are you the one that found the ear?

12:50.478 --> 12:52.470
How did you know?

12:56.818 --> 12:58.605
I just know, that's all.

13:00.154 --> 13:02.237
- I remember you from Central.
- Oh, yeah?

13:03.032 --> 13:04.694
- Are you a senior?
- Yup.

13:04.784 --> 13:07.572
- How is Central these days?
- Terrible.

13:07.662 --> 13:09.765
- I don't know. Boring.
- Yeah. What else is new, right?

13:09.789 --> 13:12.577
Really. So what are you doin' now?

13:12.667 --> 13:15.626
Uh, I'm home from school.
My father's in the hospital.

13:15.712 --> 13:17.920
- That's too bad.
- Yeah.

13:18.006 --> 13:19.998
So, what do you know about the ear?

13:20.091 --> 13:21.819
Didn't my father tell you
not to talk about it?

13:21.843 --> 13:23.800
Yeah, but you brought it up.

13:23.886 --> 13:27.926
- You know anything?
- I don't know much but bits and pieces.

13:28.016 --> 13:30.884
- I hear things.
- Yeah?

13:30.977 --> 13:33.390
My room is right above
my father's office, so...

13:33.479 --> 13:35.687
Above your father's office?

13:35.773 --> 13:39.062
- So I heard a few things about the ear.
- Uh-huh. And?

13:39.152 --> 13:42.395
Well... there are a couple of cases
I get mixed up on.

13:42.488 --> 13:43.319
Hmm?

13:43.406 --> 13:46.274
But one name that keeps coming up
is this woman singer.

13:46.367 --> 13:49.826
She lives in an apartment building
that is real close to your house.

13:49.912 --> 13:52.325
It's also close to the field
where you found the ear.

13:52.415 --> 13:55.328
It's a strange world, isn't it?

13:55.918 --> 13:56.749
Yeah.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.647
Do you know where this woman's
apartment building is?

13:58.671 --> 14:01.084
Yeah. It's really close by.
That's what's so creepy.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.235
They had her under surveillance
for a couple of months,

14:03.259 --> 14:07.253
'cept I don't know what they found out
'cause she's not my dad's case, so...

14:08.848 --> 14:11.682
I, uh, guess you gotta
get back home pretty soon, huh?

14:11.768 --> 14:13.600
Mmm, not really. Why?

14:13.686 --> 14:15.803
Well, um...

14:15.897 --> 14:17.638
You wanna see the building.

14:17.732 --> 14:19.348
Yeah.

14:19.442 --> 14:21.434
- Come on. I'll show you.
- Okay.

14:24.489 --> 14:27.448
Hey, baby. Hey, babe.

14:30.286 --> 14:32.118
That's her building right there.

14:32.955 --> 14:35.038
She lives on the seventh floor.

14:42.465 --> 14:43.956
Come on.

14:58.439 --> 15:02.604
So... uh, what are you gonna do
now that you're home?

15:02.693 --> 15:05.436
I've gotta help out
at my father's hardware store.

15:05.530 --> 15:07.943
They're giving me my own hours,
which is nice.

15:10.743 --> 15:13.907
I used to know a kid that lived there.

15:13.996 --> 15:16.488
Had the biggest tongue in the world.

15:18.709 --> 15:20.701
What happened to him?

15:21.921 --> 15:23.708
I don't know.

15:23.798 --> 15:26.791
He moved away.
All my old friends are gone.

15:33.683 --> 15:35.845
You know the chicken walk?

15:35.935 --> 15:37.426
What's that?

15:42.692 --> 15:44.433
That's kind of interesting.

16:05.089 --> 16:07.001
- Coffee time.
- Yo!

16:07.675 --> 16:10.292
Hey, Double Ed, where are the overalls?

16:10.386 --> 16:13.299
They're on the bottom shelf, rolled up,

16:13.389 --> 16:14.880
where they've always been.

16:15.850 --> 16:17.762
Hey, Ed, how many fingers?

16:18.978 --> 16:20.765
Four.

16:21.772 --> 16:24.435
I still don't know how you do that.

16:24.525 --> 16:28.109
Now listen. You sure you don't
need me or this rig for a while?

16:28.196 --> 16:32.156
Well, if you wanna spray for bugs,
Jeffrey, it causes us no pain.

16:32.241 --> 16:34.073
Okeydokey, Double Ed.

16:34.160 --> 16:37.779
- Oh, it's so good to have you back.
- Yeah, sure.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.685
You hungry or thirsty, or both?

17:02.897 --> 17:04.354
I don't know.

17:04.440 --> 17:06.772
I'd like to talk to you about something.

17:07.652 --> 17:09.393
Wait just a minute.

17:10.905 --> 17:14.069
Listen. Don't you guys dare
say anything to Mike, all right?

17:14.157 --> 17:16.650
- Sure.
- It's not what you think, okay?

17:16.743 --> 17:19.828
- Promise?
- Whatever you say.

17:23.291 --> 17:24.782
I don't wanna cause any trouble.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.163
I'm here, aren't I?

17:26.253 --> 17:28.587
- Yeah, he is nice-lookin'.
- Yeah.

17:33.469 --> 17:35.677
You ever been to Arlene's?

17:35.763 --> 17:36.924
Of course.

17:50.528 --> 17:52.770
Now, are you gonna tell me why we're here?

17:58.536 --> 18:00.823
There are opportunities in life

18:00.913 --> 18:03.155
for gaining knowledge and experience.

18:04.250 --> 18:07.084
Sometimes it's necessary to take a risk.

18:08.629 --> 18:10.816
Now, I got to thinking,
I'll bet someone could learn a lot

18:10.840 --> 18:12.832
by getting into that woman's apartment.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.542
You know, sneak in, hide, and observe.

18:16.554 --> 18:18.967
- Sneak into her apartment?
- Yeah.

18:20.016 --> 18:21.723
Are you crazy?

18:21.809 --> 18:24.847
Jeffrey, she's possibly involved in murder.

18:24.937 --> 18:28.055
- This is givin' me the creeps.
- Now just settle down.

18:28.149 --> 18:30.141
I have a plan which I think will work.

18:30.234 --> 18:33.272
There's very little for you to do,
but I do need your help.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.230
Don't you even wanna hear the plan?

18:37.742 --> 18:41.656
Well, you can tell me any plan you want,
but it's not going any further than this diner.

18:42.788 --> 18:45.952
Sandy, don't take that attitude.

18:49.462 --> 18:50.919
All right.

18:51.005 --> 18:52.774
The first thing I need
is to get into her apartment

18:52.798 --> 18:55.256
and open a window
that I can crawl into later.

18:55.343 --> 18:56.834
How are you gonna do that?

18:56.927 --> 19:01.592
Right out in the car I happen to have
some old overalls and a bug-spraying rig.

19:02.516 --> 19:05.304
I will go to her apartment.
I will be the pest-control man.

19:05.394 --> 19:07.010
I will spray her apartment.

19:07.688 --> 19:10.852
After a few minutes, you knock on the door,
drawing her attention away from me,

19:10.941 --> 19:13.558
at which time I will then jimmy a window.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.714
And what am I supposed to say
when she comes to the door?

19:15.738 --> 19:18.572
You will be a Jehovah's Witness.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.650
I have some <i>Awake!</i> magazines for you.

19:21.994 --> 19:24.532
I don't need very much time.
Just a few seconds.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.455
What do you think?

19:27.541 --> 19:29.624
I don't know.

19:29.710 --> 19:34.626
I mean, it sounds like a good daydream,
but... actually doing it's too weird.

19:36.342 --> 19:37.833
It's too dangerous.

19:37.927 --> 19:40.465
Sandy, let's just try the first part.

19:45.017 --> 19:48.260
No one will suspect us because
no one would think two people like us

19:48.354 --> 19:50.641
would be crazy enough
to do something like this.

19:52.817 --> 19:55.025
You have a point there.

20:06.622 --> 20:09.365
Give me at least three minutes
from when I'm through the door.

20:09.458 --> 20:13.498
I can stall if it's more, but I need time
to find a good window. All right?

20:14.630 --> 20:15.996
All right.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.207
Let's go.

20:31.105 --> 20:32.596
Here I go.

20:33.941 --> 20:35.853
Wait a minute. What's her name?

20:35.943 --> 20:37.855
Oh, brother, Jeffrey.

20:38.946 --> 20:41.108
Dorothy Vallens, seventh floor.

20:42.575 --> 20:45.283
Look on her mailbox for the number,
bright boy.

20:47.455 --> 20:49.162
Thanks.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.948
Dorothy Vallens, seventh floor.

20:53.210 --> 20:55.827
Okay. Good luck.

20:56.630 --> 20:58.121
Good luck yourself.

20:59.675 --> 21:01.667
Three minutes. No sooner.

22:49.660 --> 22:51.572
Yes? What is it?

22:51.662 --> 22:53.745
Pest control. I gotta do your apartment.

22:57.126 --> 22:58.492
That stuff stinks.

22:58.586 --> 23:01.203
Well, this is new stuff.
There's no smell.

23:01.297 --> 23:02.788
Good.

23:16.228 --> 23:18.015
Just need to do the kitchen.

23:46.216 --> 23:48.003
Grand Central Station.

24:01.690 --> 24:03.306
It's only the bug man.

24:31.512 --> 24:33.424
- That should do it.
- Yeah?

24:40.562 --> 24:42.554
Are you all right?

24:42.648 --> 24:43.764
Yeah. What happened?

24:43.857 --> 24:46.895
Well, I was just about to go to the door
when that guy did my job for me.

24:46.986 --> 24:50.024
- Was it all right?
- Yes and no. Did you recognize him?

24:50.114 --> 24:51.776
I only saw his back.

24:51.865 --> 24:54.094
It sounded like he went out a door
at the end of the hall.

24:54.118 --> 24:57.532
Yeah. I didn't get a very good look
at him either, but he sure looked at me.

24:57.621 --> 25:00.364
I didn't have time to get a window,
but I found these keys.

25:00.457 --> 25:01.948
It's pretty nifty, huh?

25:02.042 --> 25:04.375
Yeah, if they open the door.

25:04.461 --> 25:05.461
Yeah.

25:22.896 --> 25:24.683
So, what's next?

25:26.108 --> 25:27.690
Are you game for more?

25:27.776 --> 25:31.144
I owe you one since I goofed this one up.

25:31.238 --> 25:34.857
You didn't goof it up.
But... you still owe me one.

25:41.040 --> 25:43.657
I'm gonna try and sneak in tonight.

25:45.335 --> 25:47.372
It's Friday. Do you have a date?

25:48.422 --> 25:51.631
Yeah. I do.

25:57.473 --> 26:00.341
Well, that does that.

26:14.698 --> 26:17.315
You really wanna do this, don't you?

26:17.409 --> 26:19.526
I don't want you to get involved.

26:19.620 --> 26:21.987
I do, but if something went wrong...

26:22.081 --> 26:24.323
Like you said,
they may be involved in murder.

26:30.756 --> 26:33.339
Okay. I'll tell Mike I'm sick.

26:35.135 --> 26:37.969
Just so the record is kept straight,
though,

26:38.847 --> 26:40.304
I love Mike.

26:43.018 --> 26:44.850
What do you want me to do?

26:48.232 --> 26:51.521
Well, first we'll have
a really nice dinner.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.476
Try to find out
where Dorothy Vallens sings.

26:53.570 --> 26:56.438
I already know.
It's the Slow Club on Route 7.

26:56.532 --> 26:58.990
Great. I'll pick you up about 8:00?

26:59.076 --> 27:02.114
Uh, yeah. But don't pick me up.
My dad might think it's strange.

27:02.704 --> 27:05.572
I'll walk over to your house.
I'll be there at eight o'clock. Okay?

27:05.666 --> 27:08.158
Okay. You better get out
before someone sees us.

27:08.252 --> 27:09.413
Okay.

27:17.553 --> 27:18.885
See ya!

27:45.038 --> 27:46.154
Wait.

27:47.124 --> 27:49.582
Here's to an interesting experience, huh?

27:49.668 --> 27:51.375
I'll drink to that.

27:57.634 --> 27:59.125
Man, I like Heineken.

27:59.219 --> 28:00.960
You like Heineken?

28:01.054 --> 28:03.671
Uh, well, I never really
had a Heineken before.

28:03.765 --> 28:05.757
You never had Heineken before?

28:05.851 --> 28:08.093
My dad drinks Bud.

28:08.187 --> 28:10.270
Ah. King of beers.

28:11.440 --> 28:16.856
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Blue Lady, Miss Dorothy Vallens.

30:22.738 --> 30:25.105
'Cause it's crazy.

30:25.198 --> 30:27.360
And dangerous.

30:27.451 --> 30:30.865
- My God, I should have never told you.
- I'll be all right.

30:30.954 --> 30:33.867
I don't think you should stay here though.
I think you should go home.

30:33.957 --> 30:35.744
Can you drive this car?

30:35.834 --> 30:39.293
- Yeah, but I just...
- Well, leave it in front of your house for me, okay?

30:40.380 --> 30:41.380
Okay.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.548
I'll see ya tomorrow,
and I'll tell ya how it went.

30:45.886 --> 30:47.969
I don't wanna see you tomorrow.

30:48.472 --> 30:50.885
- Mike's coming over.
- Yeah. Okay.

30:50.974 --> 30:53.261
Um, can I call you?

30:54.644 --> 30:56.180
Okay. Yeah, call.

30:56.980 --> 30:59.472
- I hope you sneak out okay.
- Yeah.

31:03.445 --> 31:05.653
I'm gonna wait here until she comes.

31:05.739 --> 31:08.777
- Sandy.
- I'm gonna honk four times.

31:08.867 --> 31:13.282
I'll go one, two, three, four,

31:13.372 --> 31:15.955
and then you'll hear it,
and you'll know she's on her way up.

31:16.041 --> 31:17.782
Okay.

31:20.545 --> 31:23.003
I don't know if you're a detective
or a pervert.

31:25.175 --> 31:27.588
Well, that's for me to know
and you to find out.

31:43.110 --> 31:44.146
See ya.

31:44.778 --> 31:46.314
Bye.

34:06.378 --> 34:09.416
Heineken.

34:34.572 --> 34:36.656
I hope you're okay, Jeffrey.

34:56.553 --> 34:58.761
Thank you, Jimmy.
See you tomorrow.

34:58.847 --> 35:00.447
- Okay. Good night.
- Good night.

35:28.877 --> 35:32.166
Hello? Yes, sir. Frank?

35:33.214 --> 35:34.580
Frank, let me talk to him.

35:34.674 --> 35:37.257
Please, Frank... sir.

35:40.639 --> 35:42.221
I like to sing "Blue Velvet."

35:44.351 --> 35:47.594
Don. Don, it's all right. Don't worry.

35:47.687 --> 35:50.521
Don. Don, can you hear me?

35:51.232 --> 35:53.098
Is little Donny all right?

35:54.903 --> 35:56.895
Is he there with you?

35:59.115 --> 36:00.697
Don?

36:03.620 --> 36:05.452
You mean Meadow Lane?

36:06.456 --> 36:08.288
Frank! Frank, what's the matter with him?

36:11.211 --> 36:13.544
I know. I'll be sweet.

36:16.299 --> 36:17.881
Mommy loves you.

36:20.261 --> 36:22.173
Okay, Frank, sir.

37:02.470 --> 37:03.470
Oh.

38:31.142 --> 38:33.475
Get out of there! Get out!

38:33.561 --> 38:36.269
Put your hands up! On your head! Do it!

38:37.357 --> 38:40.100
Get on your knees! Do it!

38:40.193 --> 38:42.105
What are you doing?

38:42.195 --> 38:45.233
Who are you? What's your name?
What's your name?

38:45.323 --> 38:47.030
- Jeffrey.
- Jeffrey what?

38:47.575 --> 38:48.575
Jeffrey nothing.

38:50.537 --> 38:53.154
Give me your wallet. Give me your wallet!

39:00.255 --> 39:01.712
"Jeffrey Beaumont"?

39:01.798 --> 39:04.211
What are you doing in my apartment,
Jeffrey Beaumont?

39:04.968 --> 39:06.800
I wanted to see you.

39:06.886 --> 39:09.720
Are you kidding? Who sent you here?

39:09.806 --> 39:12.219
- Nobody.
- I've seen you before.

39:13.226 --> 39:15.513
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key.

39:15.603 --> 39:17.765
I didn't mean to do anything
except see you.

39:18.731 --> 39:21.269
What did you see tonight?

39:21.359 --> 39:22.850
Tell me!

39:22.944 --> 39:25.152
I saw you come in.
I saw you talk on the phone.

39:25.238 --> 39:28.151
- And then?
- You got undressed.

39:30.493 --> 39:33.327
Do you sneak in girls' apartments
to see them get undressed?

39:34.372 --> 39:36.159
No, never before this.

39:36.916 --> 39:39.499
Get undressed. I want to see you.

39:39.586 --> 39:41.418
Look, I'm sorry. Just let me leave.

39:41.504 --> 39:44.247
No way! I want to see you! Get undressed!

40:02.400 --> 40:03.811
Stand up.

40:18.333 --> 40:19.414
Come closer.

40:29.552 --> 40:31.009
Closer.

40:40.438 --> 40:42.270
What do you want?

40:44.692 --> 40:46.274
I don't know.

40:59.332 --> 41:02.370
Don't move. Don't look at me.

41:15.181 --> 41:17.013
- Do you like that?
- Yes.

41:19.852 --> 41:22.185
Don't touch me, or I'll kill you!

41:24.107 --> 41:25.598
Do you like talk like that?

41:27.151 --> 41:28.151
No.

41:31.072 --> 41:33.064
Get over there on that couch.

41:38.830 --> 41:40.241
Lie down.

41:59.350 --> 42:02.093
Shut up! Don't say anything.
Go hide in the closet.

42:02.186 --> 42:05.520
Don't say anything, or I'll kill you.
I mean it.

42:37.430 --> 42:39.638
- Hello, baby.
- Shut up!

42:39.724 --> 42:42.558
It's Daddy, you shithead!
Where's my bourbon?

42:46.272 --> 42:48.764
Can't you fuckin' remember anything?

43:02.789 --> 43:04.621
Now it's dark.

43:12.840 --> 43:14.422
Spread your legs.

43:25.895 --> 43:27.511
Wider.

43:29.982 --> 43:31.814
Now show it to me.

43:52.463 --> 43:54.045
Don't you fuckin' look at me.

44:23.494 --> 44:24.780
Mommy.

44:33.087 --> 44:36.205
Mommy! Mommy!

44:37.008 --> 44:38.749
Mommy.

44:38.843 --> 44:40.379
Mommy loves you, Frank.

44:40.469 --> 44:43.803
Baby wants to fuck!

44:43.890 --> 44:47.133
All right, get ready to fuck!

44:47.226 --> 44:49.718
You fucker's fucker! You fucker!

44:52.440 --> 44:55.103
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

44:55.735 --> 44:57.397

45:11.709 --> 45:16.795
Baby wants blue velvet.
I love it. I love it. I love it.

45:16.881 --> 45:19.669
Mommy...

45:37.026 --> 45:40.190
Don't you fuckin' look at me!
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

45:45.368 --> 45:49.078
Look at me. Daddy's coming home.

45:52.208 --> 45:53.790
Daddy's comin' home.

45:56.170 --> 45:59.504

46:16.357 --> 46:19.225
Daddy's coming home!

46:44.135 --> 46:46.218
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

47:04.989 --> 47:06.230
Now it's dark.

47:21.380 --> 47:22.871
You stay alive, baby.

47:25.259 --> 47:27.296
Do it for Van Gogh.

48:02.088 --> 48:03.920
Why don't you lie down?

48:05.174 --> 48:07.006
Come on. I'll help you.

48:17.228 --> 48:19.185
I don't like that.

48:19.271 --> 48:21.934
- What do you want?
- Nothing.

48:24.193 --> 48:25.684
Are you all right?

48:29.323 --> 48:30.905
Yeah, I'm all right.

48:33.744 --> 48:35.781
I'm all right.

48:35.871 --> 48:37.533
I'll go then.

48:38.999 --> 48:40.706
Don?

48:40.793 --> 48:42.500
- Oh, Don!
- No.

48:42.586 --> 48:45.499
Oh, Don, hold me. Hold me.

48:46.340 --> 48:49.583
I'm scared. I'm scared.

48:50.344 --> 48:51.630
I'm scared.

48:52.721 --> 48:54.587
It's okay. It's okay.

48:54.682 --> 48:57.299
Don? Don?

48:59.895 --> 49:01.682
Are you back?

49:11.824 --> 49:13.531
Do you like me?

49:17.872 --> 49:19.955
- Do you like me?
- Yes.

49:29.341 --> 49:31.958
Do you like the way I feel?

49:32.052 --> 49:33.543
Yes.

49:40.853 --> 49:42.685
See my breast?

49:45.858 --> 49:47.690
You can feel it.

49:51.071 --> 49:54.485
My nipple... is getting hard.

49:56.535 --> 49:58.447
You can touch it.

50:04.126 --> 50:06.118
You can feel it.

50:08.130 --> 50:10.213
Do you like the way I feel?

50:11.884 --> 50:13.125
Yes.

50:16.013 --> 50:17.629
Feel me.

50:22.728 --> 50:23.639
Hit me.

50:23.729 --> 50:24.729
No.

50:25.981 --> 50:27.313
Dorothy, no. Stop it.

50:27.399 --> 50:28.560
Hit me.

50:29.193 --> 50:30.934
Hit me.

50:31.028 --> 50:32.519
Hit me!

51:11.110 --> 51:12.442
I'm leaving now.

51:14.446 --> 51:16.028
Torned.

51:18.659 --> 51:20.070
Torned.

51:22.871 --> 51:24.453
Help me.

51:48.731 --> 51:51.269
Oh, my God. That hat.

51:54.111 --> 51:55.693
She's married.

51:56.655 --> 51:57.655
"Don."

52:07.166 --> 52:08.907
Help me.

52:52.294 --> 52:54.001
Now it's dark.

52:54.546 --> 52:57.038
Hit me. Hit me.

53:06.058 --> 53:07.890
Man, oh, man.

53:14.191 --> 53:16.604
- Sandy, can you talk?
<i>- Uh-uh. Mike's here.</i>

53:16.694 --> 53:19.778
Oh, he is.
I guess I'll talk to you later then.

53:19.863 --> 53:21.274
<i>Well, how'd it go?</i>

53:21.365 --> 53:23.652
It went okay. I'll tell you about it.

53:23.742 --> 53:25.233
<i>I'll pick you up at 8:00.</i>

53:25.327 --> 53:29.287
New ax, 48721.

53:30.207 --> 53:34.668
22.95.

53:37.005 --> 53:38.416
I'll see you then.

53:38.507 --> 53:40.169
<i>- Okay, great.</i>
- Bye-bye.

53:40.259 --> 53:41.259
<i>Bye.</i>

54:19.256 --> 54:20.838
Well?

54:21.800 --> 54:24.087
Aren't you gonna tell me about it?

54:25.971 --> 54:27.178
Okay.

54:32.478 --> 54:34.595
It's a strange world, Sandy.

54:40.444 --> 54:43.608
Dorothy Vallens is married
to a man named Don.

54:44.990 --> 54:46.481
They have a son.

54:48.619 --> 54:52.078
I think the son and the husband have
been kidnapped by a man named Frank.

54:53.582 --> 54:57.326
Frank has done this
to force Dorothy to do things for him.

54:58.837 --> 55:00.453
I think she wants to die.

55:03.675 --> 55:06.292
I think Frank cut the ear I found
off her husband

55:06.386 --> 55:08.252
as a warning for her to stay alive.

55:11.016 --> 55:12.632
Frank is a...

55:15.604 --> 55:17.596
is a very dangerous man.

55:19.274 --> 55:20.765
My God.

55:22.694 --> 55:26.563
- Should you tell my father?
- No. I can't do that.

55:27.574 --> 55:29.611
I can't prove any of this.

55:29.701 --> 55:33.570
I found out my information illegally.
You could get into a lot of trouble.

55:36.250 --> 55:37.991
You saw a lot in one night.

55:41.964 --> 55:43.705
It is a strange world.

55:51.056 --> 55:53.048
Why are there people like Frank?

55:53.976 --> 55:56.093
Why is there so much trouble
in this world?

55:58.105 --> 55:59.721
I don't know.

56:05.445 --> 56:07.027
I had a dream.

56:11.201 --> 56:13.614
In fact, it was the night I met you.

56:20.961 --> 56:24.454
In the dream, there was our world...

56:25.549 --> 56:29.338
and the world was dark
because there weren't any robins.

56:29.678 --> 56:31.886
And the robins represented love.

56:35.517 --> 56:39.932
And for the longest time,
there was just this darkness.

56:41.106 --> 56:42.938
And all of a sudden,

56:43.025 --> 56:46.314
thousands of robins were set free.

56:46.403 --> 56:50.693
And they flew down
and brought this blinding light of love.

56:52.951 --> 56:56.444
And it seemed like that love

56:56.538 --> 56:59.531
would be the only thing
that would make any difference.

57:01.543 --> 57:03.284
And it did.

57:12.763 --> 57:14.755
So I guess it means...

57:16.516 --> 57:19.008
there is trouble till the robins come.

57:21.813 --> 57:23.645
You're a neat girl.

57:24.816 --> 57:25.897
So are you.

57:26.818 --> 57:29.310
I mean... you're a neat guy.

57:39.039 --> 57:41.907
Uh, I guess we better go.

57:43.251 --> 57:45.163
Yeah. I guess so.

58:12.364 --> 58:15.198
Hi. May I come in?

58:15.283 --> 58:16.649
Yes.

58:19.121 --> 58:20.532
Hurry, though.

58:29.131 --> 58:31.293
Are you all right?

58:31.383 --> 58:33.215
No, I'm not.

58:35.137 --> 58:37.094
Why are you here?

58:37.180 --> 58:39.593
- What do you want?
- I, uh...

58:41.977 --> 58:44.264
I looked for you in my closet tonight.

58:47.441 --> 58:49.398
It's crazy, I know.

58:49.484 --> 58:51.521
I don't know where you come from, but...

58:52.404 --> 58:54.020
I like you.

58:55.407 --> 58:58.866
It's not crazy. I like you too.

59:03.623 --> 59:06.240
I liked being with you last night.

59:07.127 --> 59:08.618
Same here.

59:13.550 --> 59:17.089
Please be with me. Be with me, please.

Oh, great.

01:02:55.522 --> 01:02:57.138
- You're late.
- I'm sorry.

01:02:58.316 --> 01:03:01.684
- What am I gonna do now?
- You wanna go talk to him?

01:03:01.778 --> 01:03:05.897
Yeah, but...
I don't think it's gonna do much good.

01:03:05.991 --> 01:03:08.779
- Let's just go. I'll try to talk to him later.
- Okay.

01:03:08.868 --> 01:03:12.236
One!

01:03:18.128 --> 01:03:20.120
See that clock on the wall?

01:03:22.257 --> 01:03:23.998
Yeah.

01:03:24.092 --> 01:03:27.802
Five minutes from now, you're not
gonna believe what I've told you.

01:03:32.726 --> 01:03:34.217
Number one:

01:03:35.562 --> 01:03:38.475
<i>Today I staked out Frank's place
with a camera.</i>

01:03:39.774 --> 01:03:42.482
<i>Now, there's another man
involved in all this.</i>

01:03:42.569 --> 01:03:44.526
<i>I call him the Yellow Man.</i>

01:03:45.989 --> 01:03:48.606
<i>You saw his back the other day
at Dorothy's apartment.</i>

01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:54.492
<i>Today I saw the Yellow Man go into
Frank's building, laughing with Frank.</i>

01:03:55.290 --> 01:03:57.498
Now, the only trouble is,
what does that prove?

01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:02.370
Nothing, really, but it's interesting.

01:04:04.632 --> 01:04:06.339
Number two:

01:04:07.135 --> 01:04:10.754
I saw the Yellow Man come out
and meet up with a well-dressed man

01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:12.679
carrying an alligator briefcase.

01:04:27.489 --> 01:04:29.209
They went to this factory building
downtown,

01:04:29.282 --> 01:04:31.490
stood on a staircase
and looked off in the distance.

01:04:36.122 --> 01:04:40.457
Now get this.
In the distance, there was a murder.

01:04:41.461 --> 01:04:44.204
<i>This drug dealer was shot to death
and a woman had her legs broken.</i>

01:04:44.297 --> 01:04:46.789
<i>Jeffrey.</i>

01:04:50.345 --> 01:04:53.804
Then these two guys told me that the police
would find a huge amount of drugs

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:55.426
in the dead dealer's place.

01:04:56.393 --> 01:04:58.385
I can't believe what you're finding out.

01:05:00.605 --> 01:05:02.471
Are you gonna continue with this?

01:05:04.526 --> 01:05:05.733
Yeah.

01:05:06.778 --> 01:05:09.646
Until when? I mean,
what are you gonna do with this stuff?

01:05:09.739 --> 01:05:11.526
Well, I don't know.

01:05:14.077 --> 01:05:16.410
You're not going back to her apartment?

01:05:17.372 --> 01:05:19.329
Yeah.

01:05:20.875 --> 01:05:22.491
Jeffrey, why?

01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:28.919
I'm seeing something
that was always hidden.

01:05:30.802 --> 01:05:34.591
I'm involved in a mystery.
I'm in the middle of a mystery.

01:05:34.681 --> 01:05:36.843
And it's all secret.

01:05:38.435 --> 01:05:40.176
You like mysteries that much?

01:05:41.146 --> 01:05:42.307
Yeah.

01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:47.391
You're a mystery.

01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:52.818
I like you... very much.

01:06:03.084 --> 01:06:04.575
Oh, yeah?

01:06:13.303 --> 01:06:16.216
Jeffrey. Don't, please.

01:06:24.731 --> 01:06:26.848
You worry about me, really?

01:06:27.484 --> 01:06:29.191
Yeah.

01:06:29.277 --> 01:06:31.189
Is that so surprising?

01:06:32.322 --> 01:06:34.530
Yeah, I worry... a lot.

01:06:37.327 --> 01:06:39.319
I got you into this.

01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:29.223
What do you want?

01:08:29.314 --> 01:08:31.522
I want you to hurt me.

01:08:31.608 --> 01:08:35.227
No. I don't want to hurt you.
I told you, I want to help you.

01:08:36.362 --> 01:08:39.069
Dorothy, I know some of what's happening.

01:08:39.157 --> 01:08:41.819
Frank has your husband and son,
doesn't he?

01:08:43.328 --> 01:08:45.944
Dorothy, you gotta do something...
go to the police or...

01:08:48.166 --> 01:08:49.452
No police.

01:08:50.542 --> 01:08:52.158
No police.

01:08:52.252 --> 01:08:54.085
Don! Hit me!

01:08:54.171 --> 01:08:55.582
No! No!

01:08:55.673 --> 01:08:57.665
Get away! Get away from my bed!

01:08:57.759 --> 01:08:58.966
Get away!

01:09:27.287 --> 01:09:29.279
I have your disease in me now.

01:09:54.857 --> 01:09:56.849
He used to make me laugh.

01:09:58.611 --> 01:10:00.603
I'm sorry, Dorothy.

01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:04.356
I should go.

01:10:04.450 --> 01:10:05.861
Yes.

01:10:12.208 --> 01:10:14.370
You think I'm crazy, don't you?

01:10:15.378 --> 01:10:17.495
I want you to stay.

01:10:17.588 --> 01:10:18.920
Don't hate me.

01:10:19.006 --> 01:10:21.623
Oh, I sure don't hate you.

01:10:21.718 --> 01:10:23.380
I'm not crazy.

01:10:24.387 --> 01:10:26.800
I know the difference
between right and wrong.

01:10:28.224 --> 01:10:29.840
That's good.

01:10:31.894 --> 01:10:33.851
You're my special friend.

01:10:37.692 --> 01:10:39.775
I still have you inside of me.

01:10:41.237 --> 01:10:42.853
It helps me.

01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:45.526
I need you.

01:10:47.577 --> 01:10:50.240
- I'll call you.
- Okay.

01:10:51.831 --> 01:10:53.993
- Soon?
- Mmm.

01:10:56.502 --> 01:10:58.494
- Are you lying to me?
- No.

01:10:59.756 --> 01:11:01.167
- Are you sure?
- Hey!

01:11:04.594 --> 01:11:06.176
Hello, baby.

01:11:07.805 --> 01:11:09.216
Who is this fuck?

01:11:10.099 --> 01:11:12.716
A friend. He's from the neighborhood.

01:11:14.187 --> 01:11:16.304
We were just talking.

01:11:16.397 --> 01:11:18.013
Oh.

01:11:19.025 --> 01:11:20.732
You're from the neighborhood.

01:11:21.778 --> 01:11:23.314
Yeah.

01:11:23.404 --> 01:11:25.020
You're a neighbor.

01:11:26.866 --> 01:11:29.324
Well, what's your name, neighbor?

01:11:29.410 --> 01:11:31.026
Jeffrey.

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:33.112
He's a good kid, Frank.

01:11:34.207 --> 01:11:36.073
Shut the fuck up!

01:11:39.587 --> 01:11:42.079
Hey, you wanna go for a ride?

01:11:42.173 --> 01:11:44.039
No, thanks.

01:11:44.133 --> 01:11:47.001
"No, thanks"? Wh-What does that mean?

01:11:47.094 --> 01:11:49.461
- I don't want to go.
- Go where?

01:11:49.555 --> 01:11:54.016
- For a ride.
- A ride. Hell, that's a good idea.

01:11:54.101 --> 01:11:55.808
Okay. Let's go.

01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:02.229
Hey. Let's go. Get your fuckin' robe!

01:12:02.318 --> 01:12:03.729
Raymond?

01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:05.982
Come on. We're gonna go for a joyride.

01:12:06.072 --> 01:12:07.734
Joyride.

01:12:20.711 --> 01:12:22.577
All right, where do you want to go?

01:12:24.423 --> 01:12:27.632
Oh, I know. We got to go to Ben's, right?

01:12:27.718 --> 01:12:29.550
Oh, right. We've got to see Ben.

01:12:31.055 --> 01:12:33.172
Yeah, we got to, got to, got to, got to.

01:12:33.266 --> 01:12:35.178
We may all be killed.

01:12:38.604 --> 01:12:41.187
He's a pussy, Frank. He's a pussy.

01:12:41.274 --> 01:12:44.108
Yeah, but he's our pussy. Right, Tits?

01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:46.401
Pussy heaven.

01:12:46.487 --> 01:12:49.571
- You ever been to pussy heaven?
- No.

01:12:49.657 --> 01:12:53.446
- Wh-What'd he say?
- No. No. Hasn't been to pussy heaven.

01:12:56.372 --> 01:12:59.206
Ooh! Po-lice call. Po-lice call.

01:12:59.292 --> 01:13:01.249
Bury that fuck!

01:28:52.577 --> 01:28:57.789
I know some things. They could help
your father, but you might get into trouble.

01:28:57.874 --> 01:29:01.333
Look, forget me. You've got to tell him.

01:29:01.795 --> 01:29:04.037
Okay.

01:29:04.130 --> 01:29:05.666
I promise I won't mention you.

01:29:06.216 --> 01:29:09.960
Jeffrey, I mean it. It doesn't matter.

01:29:10.637 --> 01:29:12.970
Good. I'll see you Friday, if not before.

01:29:13.056 --> 01:29:14.263
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Good.

01:29:14.349 --> 01:29:16.056
- Bye-bye, Sandy.
<i>- Bye.</i>

01:29:33.201 --> 01:29:34.863
- I don't want to talk about it.
- But...

01:29:34.953 --> 01:29:37.491
Everything is okay now.

01:29:37.581 --> 01:29:39.368
I just don't want to talk about it.

01:29:39.457 --> 01:29:42.575
But sometimes
it's good to talk things over, Jeffrey.

01:29:42.669 --> 01:29:44.706
For instance,
they say that many marriages...

01:29:44.796 --> 01:29:47.004
Aunt Barbara...

01:29:47.090 --> 01:29:48.922
I love you, but you're gonna get it.

01:30:20.832 --> 01:30:22.448
Gordon.

01:30:22.542 --> 01:30:26.627
Gordon went right up to 'em in broad daylight,
of course, 'cause he's the man, right?

01:30:26.713 --> 01:30:30.923
And he took all those drugs away,
and it was beautiful.

01:31:04.376 --> 01:31:05.992
I got it.

01:31:08.630 --> 01:31:11.122
- Jeffrey. Come on in.
- Jeffrey?

01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:15.126
Hi, Sandy.

01:31:15.220 --> 01:31:16.427
Hi, Jeffrey.

01:31:16.513 --> 01:31:18.550
I'm sorry to bother you,
but I need to talk to you.

01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:21.849
Okay. Looks like you had a bad face-lift.

01:31:21.935 --> 01:31:24.598
- Yeah.
- Come on into my study.

01:31:29.859 --> 01:31:33.102
I have to show you some photos
and tell you some things about them.

01:31:37.492 --> 01:31:39.449
This is the first picture.

01:31:41.121 --> 01:31:42.407
It's Frank Booth.

01:31:44.290 --> 01:31:47.078
He is a very sick and dangerous man.

01:31:48.003 --> 01:31:50.245
His address is on the back of the photo.

01:31:52.215 --> 01:31:55.959
This photo is of Frank and another man
as they went into Frank's building.

01:32:14.446 --> 01:32:18.611
And then that man came out
and met with a third man.

01:32:18.700 --> 01:32:21.192
This well-dressed guy. Here's that photo.

01:32:26.416 --> 01:32:29.534
I think a woman named Dorothy Vallens
is in trouble with these people.

01:32:30.962 --> 01:32:33.375
I think Frank kidnapped
her husband and son.

01:32:33.465 --> 01:32:35.047
I have no hard proof of any of this.

01:32:38.344 --> 01:32:41.178
- Is Sandy part of this?
- Oh, no. No.

01:32:44.851 --> 01:32:47.059
Who else knows you have these photos?

01:32:47.145 --> 01:32:49.387
Just you and the photo lab.

01:32:50.774 --> 01:32:54.063
- And you're through with this business now?
- Yes, sir, I am.

01:32:57.822 --> 01:33:00.109
For now, all right, you better be.

01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:02.692
And Sandy better not be
involved with this, I can tell you.

01:33:08.124 --> 01:33:10.741
Be prepared to come in
for further interrogation on this later.

01:33:12.378 --> 01:33:13.539
Yes, sir.

01:33:23.139 --> 01:33:24.505
Is everything okay?

01:33:24.599 --> 01:33:27.342
Yeah. Is Friday still on?

01:33:28.061 --> 01:33:30.053
- You didn't tell him about me?
- No.

01:33:31.773 --> 01:33:34.891
Why did I ever get you going on this,
Jeffrey?

01:33:38.363 --> 01:33:42.198
- Of course Friday's still on.
- Great. See you then.

01:33:43.576 --> 01:33:45.818
Good night, Detective Williams.

01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:53.163
- Night, Sandy.
- Good night, Jeffrey.

01:34:02.595 --> 01:34:04.928
Dad?

01:34:05.014 --> 01:34:06.471
What's wrong?

01:34:07.642 --> 01:34:10.055
There'd better be nothing wrong.

01:35:07.535 --> 01:35:09.572
Looks like it's straight.

01:35:09.662 --> 01:35:12.370
- Okay. I'll get it.
- Okay, thanks.

01:35:16.419 --> 01:35:18.731
- Good evening, Jeffrey. Come on in.
- Thanks, Mrs. Williams.

01:35:18.755 --> 01:35:20.542
- She's all ready.
- Okay.

01:35:22.634 --> 01:35:24.421
You look great.

01:35:24.510 --> 01:35:26.001
Thanks.

01:35:26.554 --> 01:35:29.262
- Hello, Detective Williams.
- Hello, Jeffrey.

01:35:29.349 --> 01:35:30.931
- You all set?
- Almost.

01:35:31.726 --> 01:35:32.933
Hey, John, get a move on.

01:35:39.609 --> 01:35:41.020
Just a minute, Tom.

01:35:43.321 --> 01:35:45.313
Easy does it, Jeffrey.

01:35:47.033 --> 01:35:48.444
Behave yourself.

01:35:49.494 --> 01:35:50.494
Don't blow it.

01:35:52.121 --> 01:35:54.283
Come on, John. Get it in gear, pal.

01:35:55.083 --> 01:35:56.699
So long, Jeffrey.

01:35:56.793 --> 01:35:59.376
- You two have a nice time tonight, okay?
- Okay.

01:35:59.462 --> 01:36:01.124
What's going on?

01:36:01.214 --> 01:36:03.581
Just a little fatherly advice.

01:36:03.675 --> 01:36:05.758
That's right, Jeffrey.

01:36:05.843 --> 01:36:07.584
Come on.

01:36:07.679 --> 01:36:09.762
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

01:36:09.847 --> 01:36:11.179
Good night, Mom.

01:36:11.266 --> 01:36:13.428
Bye. Have a good time.

01:36:13.518 --> 01:36:14.850
- Night, Sandy.
- Good night, Tom.

01:36:22.777 --> 01:36:24.814
Jeffrey, what was that all about?

01:36:24.904 --> 01:36:26.020
It's nothing.

01:36:26.990 --> 01:36:28.401
Really.

01:36:29.826 --> 01:36:31.283
It's good to see you.

01:36:32.287 --> 01:36:34.074
It's good to see you.

01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:42.627
You look beautiful.

01:36:45.758 --> 01:36:47.044
Thank you.

01:36:55.059 --> 01:36:56.550
Hi.

01:37:02.567 --> 01:37:03.978
Just a minute.

01:37:08.656 --> 01:37:10.488
- Lookin' good!
- Thank you.

01:37:21.294 --> 01:37:23.411
- It's all taken care of.
- Okay.

01:37:23.504 --> 01:37:26.668
Um, you want something to drink?

01:37:28.843 --> 01:37:30.334
Want to dance?

01:37:32.305 --> 01:37:33.796
Yeah.

- Bye.
- Good night.

01:40:12.381 --> 01:40:14.668
- What's goin' on?
- What is it?

01:40:16.802 --> 01:40:18.589
They're gonna hit us.

01:40:19.889 --> 01:40:22.347
- Oh, my God, what's wrong?
- It's Frank.

01:40:29.815 --> 01:40:30.726
Move it!

01:40:30.816 --> 01:40:32.853
Hang on.

01:40:36.447 --> 01:40:37.904
I can't outrun this guy.

01:40:37.990 --> 01:40:40.983
- My father's got a gun at home.
- Jeffrey, no.

01:40:41.077 --> 01:40:42.943
Sandy, this guy's a killer, I promise you.

01:40:47.708 --> 01:40:50.621
It's Mike! Jeffrey, it's Mike. Oh, my God.

01:40:51.754 --> 01:40:52.754
Oh.

01:40:55.841 --> 01:40:57.798
Whoo! Get him, Mike!

01:40:59.804 --> 01:41:02.968
Get outta the car!
Come on! Get outta there!

01:41:04.225 --> 01:41:07.514
You stole my girl, you bastard.
Now I'm gonna kick your ass. Come on!

01:41:07.603 --> 01:41:10.266
Right here, right in front
of your own stupid house.

01:41:10.356 --> 01:41:12.723
- Get outta here!
- Mike, stop it.

01:41:12.817 --> 01:41:14.729
Shut up! Just shut up, all right?

01:41:14.819 --> 01:41:17.232
Nobody's talkin' to you, all right?

01:41:17.321 --> 01:41:19.904
- Come on.
- Mike, look, I don't wanna cause any problems.

01:41:21.617 --> 01:41:23.512
Who's that, huh? Is that your mother?
That your mother?

01:41:23.536 --> 01:41:24.846
- Dorothy.
- That your mother, Jeffrey?

01:41:24.870 --> 01:41:27.224
- No, come here, you Ivy League shit.
- I gotta take care of someone who's hurt,

01:41:27.248 --> 01:41:28.739
in case you didn't notice.

01:41:28.833 --> 01:41:29.869
Dorothy Vallens?

01:41:38.843 --> 01:41:40.880
Come on.

01:41:49.437 --> 01:41:52.726
I'm really... Hey, I... I'm sorry.

01:41:54.817 --> 01:41:56.308
I'm really sorry.

01:41:56.402 --> 01:41:59.019
- I di... I didn't know. I'm really sorry.
- It's okay. It's okay.

01:41:59.947 --> 01:42:01.609
I thought you were gonna kill him, man.

01:42:01.699 --> 01:42:03.361
We've gotta get her out of here.

01:42:03.451 --> 01:42:06.740
Take her to my house. My father can
get an ambulance faster than anyone.

01:42:06.829 --> 01:42:08.866
His partner won't be there, will he?

01:42:08.956 --> 01:42:10.948
- No, probably not. Why?
- Nothing.

01:42:11.042 --> 01:42:13.375
Watch out for Mike.

01:42:13.461 --> 01:42:16.078
Oh, God.

01:42:17.423 --> 01:42:19.881
Is that you, Jeffrey?

01:42:19.967 --> 01:42:21.799
Yeah. It's me.

01:42:21.886 --> 01:42:23.377
Oh, Jeffrey.

01:42:24.430 --> 01:42:26.046
Jeffrey.

01:42:32.396 --> 01:42:35.309
Dad? Mom?

01:42:35.399 --> 01:42:38.358
- I'm in here, honey.
- Mom?

01:42:38.444 --> 01:42:40.652
All right, I'll be right there.

01:42:40.738 --> 01:42:42.775
Is Dad home?

01:42:42.865 --> 01:42:45.198
No. He oughta...

01:42:45.284 --> 01:42:48.277
You better call him.
And, uh, get an ambulance.

01:42:48.371 --> 01:42:49.782
Where have you been?

01:42:50.665 --> 01:42:52.907
Oh, God.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.117
Oh, God, they've hurt him.

01:42:55.211 --> 01:42:58.079
Oh, Jeffrey! Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me!

01:42:58.172 --> 01:42:59.733
- Hold me! Hold me!
- It's okay, it's okay.

01:42:59.757 --> 01:43:02.124
- Oh, God.
- It's okay. Shh. It's okay.

01:43:06.639 --> 01:43:08.471
My secret lover.

01:43:10.726 --> 01:43:13.594
I've called for an ambulance,
and the police are on their way.

01:43:13.688 --> 01:43:15.600
Don't get the police!

01:43:17.149 --> 01:43:18.640
Stop it!

01:43:19.402 --> 01:43:21.485
I love you! Love me!

01:43:24.949 --> 01:43:27.032
He put his disease in me.

01:43:28.077 --> 01:43:31.366
Tell me it's all right
I opened myself to you.

01:43:32.206 --> 01:43:35.995
- Tell me it's all right. It's all right.
- Sandy, please.

01:43:36.085 --> 01:43:37.292
Sandy?

01:43:37.378 --> 01:43:39.586
I'll get a coat to put on her.

01:43:43.384 --> 01:43:45.296
Jeffrey?

01:43:45.386 --> 01:43:48.003
- What's going on here?
- I'll tell you.

01:43:49.181 --> 01:43:52.470
They... They've hurt his head.

01:43:53.519 --> 01:43:54.851
Who, Dorothy?

01:43:56.188 --> 01:43:58.350
Don.

01:43:58.441 --> 01:43:59.932
Help him.

01:44:01.193 --> 01:44:02.809
Help him.

01:44:04.321 --> 01:44:06.358
Promise me you'll help him!

01:44:10.870 --> 01:44:12.236
Okay.

01:44:17.001 --> 01:44:19.584
He put his disease in me.

01:44:38.397 --> 01:44:41.084
Would you like to come with us
in the ambulance or take your own car?

01:44:41.108 --> 01:44:42.940
I'll be right with you.

01:44:51.076 --> 01:44:52.988
I should go.

01:44:53.078 --> 01:44:54.785
- Go.
- Sandy.

01:45:03.506 --> 01:45:05.998
Hold me! I'm falling!

01:45:06.091 --> 01:45:08.879
I'm falling! Hold me!

01:45:15.601 --> 01:45:17.342
You lied to me.

01:45:17.436 --> 01:45:20.929
<i>Sandy, please, forgive me.</i>

01:45:21.774 --> 01:45:23.265
<i>I love you.</i>

01:45:24.193 --> 01:45:26.025
I forgive you, Jeffrey.

01:45:31.826 --> 01:45:33.533
I love you.

01:45:38.082 --> 01:45:39.789
God, I love you.

01:45:42.211 --> 01:45:43.998
I-I...

01:45:44.088 --> 01:45:46.421
But I couldn't watch that.

01:45:52.054 --> 01:45:54.922
- Is she okay?
<i>- Yeah, she's okay.</i>

01:45:55.015 --> 01:45:56.677
<i>Listen, get ahold of your father.</i>

01:45:56.767 --> 01:45:58.912
<i>Tell him to send the police over
to Dorothy's apartment right away.</i>

01:45:58.936 --> 01:46:01.599
Tell him to hurry. I'm leaving right now.

01:46:01.689 --> 01:46:03.931
<i>- Jeffrey, no.</i>
- I have to.

01:46:05.150 --> 01:46:07.858
- I love you.
<i>- Oh, God, be careful.</i>

01:46:07.945 --> 01:46:09.402
I will. Believe me.
