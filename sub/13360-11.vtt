dog-like creature?

37:48.784 --> 37:51.151
And other more
normal situations.

37:51.184 --> 37:55.551
Oh, I just find time
a very fascinating concept.

37:55.584 --> 37:57.418
(SIGHING)

37:57.451 --> 37:58.551
What are you doing?

37:58.584 --> 38:00.751
It's time for me to sleep.

38:00.784 --> 38:03.651
Time for you to keep watch

38:03.684 --> 38:06.218
and wake me when it's dawn.

38:11.666 --> 38:13.600
(HERCULES SNORING)

38:18.755 --> 38:20.155
Hercules?

38:21.755 --> 38:23.822
-Hercules.
-What? What?

38:24.522 --> 38:27.022
-Pendulum.
-What?

38:27.055 --> 38:30.088
The regular
swinging of a pendulum
could be used

38:30.122 --> 38:32.922
to measure
the passage of time.

38:32.955 --> 38:36.322
And you woke me
up to tell me that?

38:36.355 --> 38:39.522
-No, no,
I woke you because it's dawn.
-Oh, oh.

38:47.188 --> 38:48.322
No.

38:52.322 --> 38:53.855
-Go on.
-(SIGHS)

39:03.488 --> 39:04.555
Are you all right?

39:09.162 --> 39:10.195
Yeah.

39:11.328 --> 39:12.962
BOTH: Oh, please!

39:14.428 --> 39:15.495
We found a cure.

39:15.528 --> 39:16.728
We need to get you home.

39:35.495 --> 39:36.962
Ahhh!

39:47.328 --> 39:48.762
-Do something.
-What?

39:48.795 --> 39:50.595
Anything.

39:50.628 --> 39:54.262
Wolfsbane is said to be
useful in stopping wolves,
but that's wolves.

39:54.295 --> 39:55.728
Pythagoras!

39:55.762 --> 39:57.428
Mountain ash.
Mountain ash is also
said to be very effective...

39:57.462 --> 39:58.562
-Pythagoras!
-(GROWLING)

39:59.495 --> 40:00.528
Of course.

-Pythagoras!

Whew!

40:13.735 --> 40:15.235
(EXHALES)

40:15.268 --> 40:18.202
It wasn't mountain ash,
but it seemed to work.

40:22.268 --> 40:24.202
We need to get you home.

(JASON COUGHING)

40:33.902 --> 40:35.802
You need to take the lot.

40:42.135 --> 40:43.868
Will it work?

40:43.902 --> 40:45.468
So long as I've got
the proportions right,

40:45.502 --> 40:47.235
and so long as
he's strong, then yes.

40:49.168 --> 40:50.302
(GROANING)

41:09.775 --> 41:12.408
Please tell me Ariadne
doesn't know I was a dog.

41:13.708 --> 41:15.375
She probably won't remember.

41:15.408 --> 41:17.542
She's a woman,
they have memories
longer than the gods.

41:17.575 --> 41:20.175
-(SIGHS)
-I'm trying not
to make him worry.

41:20.208 --> 41:21.908
Right, right. Of course.

41:23.275 --> 41:25.175
I'm sure you didn't
do anything that bad.

41:25.208 --> 41:27.308
I virtually slammed the door
in her face.

41:28.142 --> 41:29.875
That's what lovers do.

41:30.642 --> 41:32.375
I think I sniffed her.

41:32.408 --> 41:34.075
Well, it could be worse,
considering.

41:36.542 --> 41:39.342
I may have growled at her.

41:40.142 --> 41:41.108
You're done for.

41:41.142 --> 41:43.275
Well, not if it was a...

41:48.908 --> 41:51.175
Ooh, that's going to
be hard to explain.

41:51.208 --> 41:54.142
Yeah, I think on this occasion
I'll have to
agree with Hercules.

41:54.175 --> 41:55.575
(GROANS)

CIRCE: Need I remind you that
you swore an oath?

42:09.648 --> 42:12.982
If you fail, it will not only
be your life I take.

42:14.815 --> 42:16.182
I have to kill Pasiphae.
