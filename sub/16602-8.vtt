- Oh, crazy.

00:20.488 --> 00:23.257
- And then he-- yesterday?
 - Yeah?

00:23.324 --> 00:24.892
He takes me on a hike.

00:24.958 --> 00:25.993
Where, like in the woods?

00:26.060 --> 00:27.695
- Yeah.
- Oh, no. Nuh-uh.

00:27.761 --> 00:29.430
Why would anyone choose
 to go hiking in the woods?

00:29.497 --> 00:31.132

 rapists out there,

00:34.668 --> 00:36.270
Well, it was his idea.

00:36.337 --> 00:37.238
You know,
 he's always coming up

00:37.305 --> 00:38.806
with these little adventures.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.441
I mean, it's so cute.

00:40.508 --> 00:42.510
Yeah, yeah.
 He'd better be cute

00:42.576 --> 00:44.245
if he's going to steal
 you away from me.

00:44.312 --> 00:46.114
Oh, [scoff].
 Oh. Oh, here he is.

00:46.180 --> 00:47.781
I can't wait.
You're going to love him.

00:47.848 --> 00:49.550
- Mm-hmm. I'm sure.
 - Hey. Hi.

01:01.962 --> 01:03.564
Wow. Here I was
 beginning to think

01:03.631 --> 01:06.234
you were entirely imaginary.

01:06.300 --> 01:07.568
- [chuckle]
 - Yeah.

01:07.635 --> 01:10.171
Well, here I am.

That's a-- That's a hell
of a dress, Deb.

01:14.208 --> 01:16.677
Oh, Shelly picked it out.
She's got a good eye.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.045
- Yeah?
 - I do.

01:18.112 --> 01:19.447
I do have a great left eye.

01:19.513 --> 01:20.748
Really strong left eye.

 You're in.

You're very natural.

05:16.717 --> 05:18.919
There's still room for
 improvement, though.

Why don't you come by
 after school?

We'll work on it.

Okay, brass section.

Okay, Shelly, see you
 at rehearsal for the play.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.951
It took you long enough.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.786
What were you doing?

05:52.853 --> 05:54.888
I never
 even heard you singing.

05:54.955 --> 05:56.957
Did you sing?

If you did,
 what did you sing?

 We've tried everything.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.730
We've brought her
to the rabbi.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.331
We've seen a psychologist.

06:04.398 --> 06:05.966
I made cheese omelets,

06:06.033 --> 06:07.901
her favorite
 since I can remember.

06:07.968 --> 06:10.571
Nothing. She was fine,
 then all of a sudden she--

06:10.638 --> 06:12.473
She quit the play,
 and she stopped eating.

06:12.540 --> 06:14.942
Why won't you eat?

06:18.378 --> 06:20.681
[sigh] It's been
weeks at this.

06:20.748 --> 06:22.215
Shelly, I want
 to help you,

06:22.282 --> 06:24.151
so I'm going to ask you
 a series of questions,

06:24.217 --> 06:26.587
and you can just
answer yes or no.
How about that?

06:28.889 --> 06:31.291
Are you having trouble
falling asleep at night?

06:31.358 --> 06:33.093
Are there nightmares
 you want to tell me about?

06:36.864 --> 06:38.999
Have you ever taken reefer
 or any other drugs?

06:41.134 --> 06:43.170
Are you afraid you're going
 to be a disappointment

06:43.236 --> 06:44.972
or that you might
 let your family down?

06:46.840 --> 06:48.108
God damn it, Shelly,
 answer the doctor.

06:51.144 --> 06:54.181
Well, I'm going to give her
 a Miltown prescription.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.650
- Mother: What for?
 - Anxiety.

06:56.717 --> 06:58.351
Eventually, she's going
 to get hungry enough,

06:58.418 --> 06:59.820
and she'll eat.

06:59.887 --> 07:01.589
Do you know how lucky you are

07:01.655 --> 07:04.424
to have what you do after
what we've been through?

07:04.492 --> 07:06.259
We came here to get
 away from starving.

07:06.326 --> 07:08.161
And to choose not to eat?

07:08.228 --> 07:09.997
It's not the Holocaust.

 cozy and clinging *

07:31.952 --> 07:34.221
* Well, sir, all I can say

* Is if I were a bell,
 I'd be ringing *

* From the moment
 we kissed tonight *

07:44.264 --> 07:47.768

 I've just got to behave *

07:52.740 --> 07:53.774
Yes, I do.

So where are you going?

07:55.208 --> 07:56.376
Inside. I'm exhausted.
 I'm gonna lie down.

You know what he's doing
down there.

07:57.678 --> 08:00.313
So what?
 Can't anyone be happy?

08:00.380 --> 08:01.849
It brings down
 God's judgment.

08:04.084 --> 08:05.619

 into that boy

08:05.686 --> 08:06.587

08:15.763 --> 08:21.635

 popping my spring *

* Or if I were a bell *

08:23.671 --> 08:28.241
* I'd go ding-dong

08:29.877 --> 08:31.912
* Ask me how do I feel

08:31.979 --> 08:36.950
* From this chemistry
 lesson I'm learning *

08:38.418 --> 08:40.253
* Well, sir, all I can say

08:40.320 --> 08:46.326
* Is if I were a bridge,
 I'd be burning *

* Yes, I knew
 my morale would crack *

Huh?

Get dressed.

09:03.176 --> 09:04.444
You have to get upstairs

09:04.511 --> 09:06.346
before your zayde
 comes home.

09:06.413 --> 09:08.548
Listen to me. He can never
 ever know about this.

09:08.616 --> 09:10.851
Understand? Understand?

09:13.621 --> 09:14.988
You're
 a very pretty dancer.

Your tante Gittel

 - Well, I thought

there was a little Southern
 dialect leaking through.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.602
I assume
 this is rigged, right?

10:05.205 --> 10:06.874
Without question.

Yeah? Your older son?
 Well, now...

 - Out.

Good night.

Where?

10:21.855 --> 10:24.491
Sneaking in, sneaking out.

10:24.557 --> 10:25.625
Never home.

Where is she going anyway?

 I made it with...

10:45.012 --> 10:46.747
cornflakes.

10:46.814 --> 10:49.817
It's as filling as meat,
though, right?

10:49.883 --> 10:52.920
Mm-hmm. It's good.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.287
I never
 should have left you.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.023
Ha. You came back.

10:56.089 --> 10:57.324
You were the better woman.

Yeah, yeah. She left you.

Bryna.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.164
Yeah?

11:08.836 --> 11:10.971

No.

11:48.341 --> 11:49.509

 There is no doubt--

11:49.576 --> 11:50.643
And I thought of everything.

11:50.710 --> 11:53.080
We got, um, candlesticks,

11:53.146 --> 11:55.448
matches,
 cartons of cigarettes.

11:55.515 --> 11:57.717
Oh, that's wonderful.
 I-- I worried about

11:57.785 --> 11:59.619
what I was going to do
 in the apocalypse.

11:59.686 --> 12:01.354
Uh-huh. Well,

12:01.421 --> 12:04.324
earthly pleasures will
 keep us sane, Yetta.

12:04.391 --> 12:05.893
Will we have chocolate?

12:05.959 --> 12:09.129
Chocolate? We got what,
 60 bars of chocolate.

12:09.196 --> 12:11.999
And we've got nine
 jars of pickles,

12:12.065 --> 12:14.201
uh, three dozen cans of tuna.

12:14.267 --> 12:15.602
Your zayde thought
 of everything.

12:15.668 --> 12:16.904
Don't you worry.

12:16.970 --> 12:18.505
It'll all be taken care of.

12:18.571 --> 12:21.608
If we each eat one bar
 of chocolate a week,

12:21.674 --> 12:24.111
then we'll have enough
 chocolate to last us 12 weeks.

12:24.177 --> 12:25.612
That's right. That's right.

12:25.678 --> 12:27.547
Look at this kid.
 he's a real Einstein.

12:27.614 --> 12:29.482
Oi, oi, oi, oi.

12:29.549 --> 12:31.819
12 weeks down there.
 The thought makes me cuckoo.

12:31.885 --> 12:33.520
Oh, but we'll all be together.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.722
And we're all
going to be safe.

I'm still your father.

12:44.764 --> 12:45.866
- Bryna: Zayde.
 - Hmm?

12:45.933 --> 12:47.767
I want to try
 a math problem.

12:47.835 --> 12:50.603
- I want to do one.
 - Okay. Okay, okay, Bryna.

12:50.670 --> 12:53.040
How many cans of soup
 do we need for six months--

12:54.474 --> 12:57.010
...if we all share
 two cans a day?

12:57.077 --> 13:00.047
Um, how many months?

13:00.113 --> 13:01.882
Does Mom have
a bunker at work?

13:01.949 --> 13:03.083
I'm not sure.

13:03.150 --> 13:04.484
- Hey!
- If she doesn't,

13:04.551 --> 13:06.686
won't she get
 nucular exploded on?

13:06.753 --> 13:09.256
No. She gets under her desk.
 That's second best.

13:10.423 --> 13:12.392
Sure, sure, but if you--

13:12.459 --> 13:15.095
if you see a bunker,
 you run there.

13:15.162 --> 13:16.229
You don't want
 your eyeballs melting

13:16.296 --> 13:17.797
straight out of their sockets.

13:17.865 --> 13:19.666
Can eyeballs really melt?

13:19.732 --> 13:22.002
I don't want Mom's
 eyeballs to melt.

13:22.069 --> 13:23.036
That's not
going to happen.

13:23.103 --> 13:24.537
If anything, you know,

13:24.604 --> 13:26.706
she'll turn into
 a three-headed monster.

13:26.773 --> 13:28.909
What if Mom doesn't make it
 to the bunker in time?

13:28.976 --> 13:30.543
Sweetie, eventually,

13:30.610 --> 13:33.346
we will all be together
 in Olam HaBa'a.

13:33.413 --> 13:36.549
- Not to worry.
 - Heaven sounds like more fun.

13:36.616 --> 13:38.318
- The kids at school said--
 - Zayde: Yeah?

13:38.385 --> 13:39.819
...that the roads
 are paved with gold

13:39.887 --> 13:41.354
and you can walk
 on marshmallow clouds.

13:41.421 --> 13:43.056
- Hmm.
 - Oh, yeah? Convert.

13:43.123 --> 13:45.592
Go eat a Waldorf salad.
Go to goyische heaven.

 - Oh, Mort.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.362
- Okay. Come on.
- Can't get his pants up.

16:02.429 --> 16:03.830
Why are you
 blocking the ladder?

is he playing at?

What is this? He needs
 to see a doctor.

Hey, is this yours, too?

 is all your fault.

 Stop that!

 in the oven.

 - You want to know why?

 and your grandmother

17:34.921 --> 17:36.889
let him run around in a skirt!

He only does it
when he's alone.

 It's nothing.

out of my house!

 for everyone.

Hi. Hi. Thank you
guys for coming.

22:58.711 --> 23:01.514
Um, I'm just
 gonna say a few things.

23:01.581 --> 23:04.116
Um, having an opening
 like this

23:04.183 --> 23:06.553
has always been
a dream of mine,

23:06.619 --> 23:08.320
and it's wonderful

23:08.387 --> 23:10.923
to have so many loved ones
 witness its birth.

23:10.990 --> 23:13.025
So thank you.

23:13.092 --> 23:15.762
Uh, I think my journey
 all started

23:15.828 --> 23:18.498
when I was a kid
 with crayons, right?

23:18.565 --> 23:21.367
I just remember sitting,
watching TV,

23:21.434 --> 23:22.869
and my mom gave me crayons

23:22.935 --> 23:24.437
because I could never
 focus on the TV,

23:24.504 --> 23:27.173
and I remember
I couldn't stop.

23:27.239 --> 23:30.076
And I would play with crayons.

23:30.142 --> 23:33.613
But the way my mom and my
 daddy would talk about it,

23:33.680 --> 23:36.148
it's like that was me
 kind of finding

23:36.215 --> 23:37.584
what I needed to do.

23:37.650 --> 23:39.552
And I got older.

23:39.619 --> 23:41.921
I remember doing
 ceramics and pottery,

23:41.988 --> 23:44.757
and it was a school thing,
 and it was good.

23:44.824 --> 23:46.693
- It was good, but it--
 - What are you doing?

23:46.759 --> 23:47.960
...but it wasn't it.

23:48.027 --> 23:49.529
Follow me.

23:51.397 --> 23:53.866
But wait for 180 seconds.

23:53.933 --> 23:58.137
...my voice. Acrylic
 is really my media now.

23:58.204 --> 24:01.373
Um, and it was
 a journey to get there.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.309
And when you look
at each piece...

24:03.375 --> 24:05.144
- 1...
- ...it's not just one...

24:05.211 --> 24:07.379
- 2, 3...
 - I think when you put
 a collection together,

24:07.446 --> 24:08.781
4, 5, 6...

24:08.848 --> 24:10.049
...it really is a meditation.

I want a pretty ring,
 Morton,

24:28.434 --> 24:30.036
not that facacteh thing.

24:30.102 --> 24:31.303
I don't--

24:31.370 --> 24:33.640
What are we gonna do?

24:33.706 --> 24:34.974
I don't know.

24:36.743 --> 24:38.778
Hmm. I just--

24:38.845 --> 24:40.246
I just need some time.

24:40.312 --> 24:44.016
I just need some time
to figure some stuff out.

24:44.083 --> 24:45.117
Okay.

24:46.185 --> 24:47.587
But until then--

24:51.223 --> 24:52.959
can you keep a secret?

Can you?

25:14.747 --> 25:16.448
.. * There she goes

25:16.515 --> 25:18.384

 on her feet again *

25:18.450 --> 25:20.419
.. * There she goes

25:20.486 --> 25:22.354
* She's down on her
 knees, my friend *

25:22.421 --> 25:24.156
- * There she goes
 - * But you know

25:24.223 --> 25:26.258

 in her eyes *

 you know she will fly *

25:35.768 --> 25:38.404

25:43.576 --> 25:44.711

25:44.777 --> 25:46.679
.. * There she goes

25:46.746 --> 25:48.014
