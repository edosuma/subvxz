WEBVTT

00:01.740 --> 00:03.264
[whimsical music]

00:07.007 --> 00:09.835
[Narrator] This is a
story about true love.

00:11.750 --> 00:13.404
I don't love you anymore, Rome.

00:15.450 --> 00:16.277
What?

00:17.800 --> 00:19.845
What happened to 'I want
to be with you forever'?

00:19.845 --> 00:22.935
You said that to me last
night, I specifically remember.

00:22.935 --> 00:26.026
I want to be with you, forever.

00:26.026 --> 00:28.028
[bell chiming]

00:29.246 --> 00:31.161
Forever is only a word.

00:32.684 --> 00:34.425
You could say that
about anything.

00:34.425 --> 00:36.340
What?

00:36.340 --> 00:38.125
'Forever is only a word,' you
could say that about anything.

00:38.125 --> 00:40.344
Words are used to signify
things and concepts,

00:40.344 --> 00:42.912
that's the entire
purpose of language.

00:42.912 --> 00:43.869
And forever is forever.

00:43.869 --> 00:45.349
Whatever.

00:45.349 --> 00:46.829
See, anytime I
try to talk to you

00:46.829 --> 00:48.874
you turn into some
philosophical discourse.

00:48.874 --> 00:50.833
Because you're saying things
that don't make any sense

00:50.833 --> 00:53.575
- so I have to-- - I don't
love you anymore, Rome.

00:53.575 --> 00:55.055
Is that clear enough for you,

00:55.055 --> 00:58.536
or do I need to justify
it, with a proof?

00:58.536 --> 01:00.408
Fucking bitch.

01:00.408 --> 01:02.540
Ow man, I'm supporting you and--

01:02.540 --> 01:05.021
See, this I
psychological warfare.

01:05.021 --> 01:06.588
Look dude, she didn't
mean what she said

01:06.588 --> 01:07.545
in the creative room, okay?

01:07.545 --> 01:08.372
She was--

01:09.330 --> 01:11.158
She was stressed.

01:11.158 --> 01:12.681
I didn't mean what I said
in the creative room,

01:12.681 --> 01:14.074
I was stressed.

01:14.074 --> 01:16.598
I do love you, forever.

01:17.599 --> 01:19.775
[Rome panting]

01:21.124 --> 01:23.387
[Leo] And now she broke
up with you again.

01:25.172 --> 01:26.738
Yeah.

01:26.738 --> 01:28.523
Tell her you don't want
to fight anymore man.

01:28.523 --> 01:31.091
Said things you don't
believe out of desperation,

01:31.091 --> 01:32.918
which is only a form of love.

01:32.918 --> 01:34.137
Armando, fuck off.

01:34.137 --> 01:35.356
You don't know shit about women.

01:35.356 --> 01:37.488
I fucked my cousin.

01:37.488 --> 01:39.316
Like, cousin's cousin.

01:40.665 --> 01:41.666
I hope.

01:41.666 --> 01:42.537
Nah, check it out.

01:44.321 --> 01:45.757
[footsteps thumping]

01:45.757 --> 01:47.890
Jesus, this girl's banging!

01:47.890 --> 01:49.413
Did you see this?

01:49.413 --> 01:51.415
I'm sorry, I take back
what I said, great job.

01:51.415 --> 01:54.505
[upbeat music]

02:02.992 --> 02:04.602
[singing in Italian]

03:05.750 --> 03:07.361
I want your dick.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.278
She wants my dick.

03:11.278 --> 03:12.844
I'll be honest man,

03:12.844 --> 03:14.411
I don't think she's
remotely interested--

03:14.411 --> 03:15.586
Or maybe she said I
like Charles Dickens

03:15.586 --> 03:16.761
but, you know, same shit.

03:16.761 --> 03:18.154
Yeah, it's very different.

03:18.154 --> 03:18.981
Come.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.679
It's a four bedroom villa,

03:21.679 --> 03:23.203
but we've only
rented three rooms.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.422
Two of the rooms
have one big bed,

03:25.422 --> 03:27.119
- the other room has two
small beds-- - Wait wait wait.

03:27.119 --> 03:28.120
Wait, wait.

03:29.339 --> 03:30.514
Keep up, asshole.

03:30.514 --> 03:31.950
You designed this because,

03:33.038 --> 03:34.910
why would you design this?

03:34.910 --> 03:36.955
What else am I supposed to
do for Architectural Design?

03:36.955 --> 03:38.827
Freaking jerk off class.

03:38.827 --> 03:41.743
So originally, you were gonna
share a bed with Amber Jane.

03:41.743 --> 03:44.615
Claire and Katrina would have
their own room sharing a bed

03:44.615 --> 03:46.965
'cause, girls are
cool with that.

03:46.965 --> 03:49.533
And I was gonna have to share
a room with Unremarkable Dan.

03:50.447 --> 03:52.275
[pizzicato music]

03:52.275 --> 03:55.670
But, one or two days into
the trip, three tops,

03:55.670 --> 03:58.673
after a steady infusion
of Aperol Spritz,

03:58.673 --> 04:01.850
the Mediterranean sun
slightly swelling our lips,

04:01.850 --> 04:03.895
and Claire realizing
how compatible we are

04:03.895 --> 04:06.507
when she girdles my rib cage
on the back of my Vespa,

04:07.986 --> 04:09.336
I was gonna shack
up with Claire.

04:09.336 --> 04:11.251
And Katrina and Unremarkable Dan

04:11.251 --> 04:13.122
would have to share the room
with the two little beds.

04:13.122 --> 04:14.254
Yeah, no, no,

04:14.254 --> 04:15.777
I'm pretty creeped out by this.

04:15.777 --> 04:18.258
You've got us living
in like a little house,

04:18.258 --> 04:20.564
with a little kitchen,
little washer, dryer--

04:20.564 --> 04:22.174
The assignment was
to draw an apartment,

04:22.174 --> 04:23.785
I couldn't just
draw three rooms.

04:23.785 --> 04:25.743
It's a mini kitchen, sack up.

04:25.743 --> 04:28.137
So you showed this
to Miss. Polotzi,

04:28.137 --> 04:29.791
with our names on the beds?

04:29.791 --> 04:31.793
Do you understand
that were Seniors

04:31.793 --> 04:33.490
and no one gives a fuck?

04:33.490 --> 04:34.883
[Rome] What grade
did she give you?

04:34.883 --> 04:36.450
She hasn't given me a grade yet.

04:36.450 --> 04:38.278
She says we need to
have a serious talk.

04:39.757 --> 04:41.977
Can you focus, do
you see the problem?

04:43.152 --> 04:44.501
Now Amber Jane's
gonna hog Claire

04:44.501 --> 04:46.634
'cause she's a fucking bitch.

04:46.634 --> 04:48.679
Katrina and Unremarkable
Dan are gonna take the room

04:48.679 --> 04:50.464
with the two little beds.

04:50.464 --> 04:52.640
And you and I are gonna
have to share a big bed.

04:54.076 --> 04:56.165
Which means...

04:56.165 --> 04:58.254
[exhales] I'll never get
to sleep with Claire.

04:58.254 --> 05:00.300
Listen, if Claire really
wants to sleep with you,

05:00.300 --> 05:03.390
which I guarantee you she
doesn't, looking at this,

05:03.390 --> 05:05.957
you could manage to
find a place to do it.

05:07.132 --> 05:09.047
I guess that's true.

05:09.047 --> 05:11.615
[triumphant music]

05:40.644 --> 05:41.819
[sighs]

05:41.819 --> 05:43.386
Thanks, Rome.

05:43.386 --> 05:44.256
No worries.

05:45.693 --> 05:49.218
[scooter engine whirring]

05:55.442 --> 05:57.922
[speaking Italian]

05:57.922 --> 05:59.359
Did you understand?

05:59.359 --> 06:00.577
No, no way man.

06:00.577 --> 06:02.405
If it has half a tank of gas,

06:02.405 --> 06:04.015
which I'm gonna check right now,

06:04.015 --> 06:05.843
then we're returning it
with half a tank of gas.

06:05.843 --> 06:06.801
Whatever.

06:14.330 --> 06:17.159
[engine whirring]

06:18.900 --> 06:21.381
See you guys at the villa,
a little later though.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.512
[engine accelerating]

06:22.512 --> 06:24.514
Who the fuck is that?

06:24.514 --> 06:26.690
That's just some guy we
met during Spring Break.

06:26.690 --> 06:28.866
All right familia,
let's do this.

06:28.866 --> 06:31.695
Unremarkable Dan, feel free to
contribute to this vacation.

06:31.695 --> 06:32.783
I can't wait to pregame.

06:32.783 --> 06:35.699
Yes! Paradoxically,

06:37.092 --> 06:38.659
the pregame is the
best part of the night.

06:38.659 --> 06:39.834
Yeah, but you can't
go in knowing that,

06:39.834 --> 06:41.444
otherwise it's not a pregame.

06:41.444 --> 06:43.620
It is a paradox.
[car engine roaring]

06:43.620 --> 06:46.231
[lovey-dovey music]

06:48.408 --> 06:50.366
[tires screeching]

07:12.432 --> 07:13.911
I need to get one of those.

07:15.478 --> 07:19.743
[pizzicato music]
Welcome to Villa Luna Bianca.

07:20.831 --> 07:22.354
Where's the rest of the group?

07:22.354 --> 07:24.661
You said three
girls, three guys.

07:24.661 --> 07:27.969
Katrina decided she was sick
this morning and couldn't come.

07:27.969 --> 07:29.710
And she's the only
reason he's here.

07:30.885 --> 07:32.669
[birds chirping]

07:32.669 --> 07:37.108
Listen, I don't give a
fuck about that story.

07:37.108 --> 07:40.851
I know you kids, first you
bring in the "small group,"

07:40.851 --> 07:45.116
the "reconnaissance team," with
the unintimidating fucktard.

07:46.030 --> 07:47.554
And once I leave,

07:47.554 --> 07:50.687
you try to sneak in
four more people.

07:50.687 --> 07:52.472
[pizzicato music]

07:54.299 --> 07:58.695
I have cameras all over this
villa, so don't fuck around.

08:01.350 --> 08:03.961
If I see you sneak into
the downstairs bedroom,

08:03.961 --> 08:07.051
I will literally
fuck you in the ass.

08:07.051 --> 08:09.010
If you pass out
in the tree house,

08:09.010 --> 08:11.491
you will wake up with
my dick in your ass.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.754
Anyone else disturbed by this?

08:13.754 --> 08:15.669
Oh, thanks for joining, Dan.

08:15.669 --> 08:17.497
What d'you mean?

08:17.497 --> 08:19.368
[Schmae] I'll come by and
serve breakfast on the terrace,

08:19.368 --> 08:21.239
from 7 to 8.

08:21.239 --> 08:25.766
Brioche, coffee, cappuccino,
fresh fruit from my garden

08:26.854 --> 08:28.682
and pancakes upon request.

08:28.682 --> 08:32.555
If you come at 7:59, it's
fine, 8:01, fuck off.

08:32.555 --> 08:35.689
Have a little
respect, Jesus fuck.

08:35.689 --> 08:36.864
Any questions?

08:36.864 --> 08:39.170
Yeah, where can we buy alcohol?

08:39.170 --> 08:41.608
This is Villa Luna
Bianca, bitch.

08:41.608 --> 08:44.393
Sorry, I didn't mean
to call you a bitch.

08:44.393 --> 08:48.615
I meant the festive,
universal festive "bitch."

08:48.615 --> 08:50.007
The villa's fully stocked.

08:50.007 --> 08:51.792
It's all included in the price.

08:51.792 --> 08:54.490
Speaking of, do
you have the cash?

08:55.665 --> 08:59.843
[cash crinkling]

09:01.541 --> 09:03.325
I have mixed feelings about
what's happening here.

09:03.325 --> 09:04.544
[sly music]

09:04.544 --> 09:06.328
See you tomorrow
between 7 and 8.

09:06.328 --> 09:07.590
[horn honking]

09:07.590 --> 09:10.375
[engine whirring]

09:10.375 --> 09:15.380
1, 2, 3, 4 guys, you're
trying to fuck me.

09:15.380 --> 09:16.860
How many people?

09:16.860 --> 09:18.688
No, no, no, this is
just um, this is just...

09:19.907 --> 09:20.951
Who are you?

09:20.951 --> 09:21.952
I'm Leonardo.

09:21.952 --> 09:23.214
[Leo] Like me.

09:23.214 --> 09:24.389
Romulus.

09:24.389 --> 09:26.391
Ah, like Romulus and Remus.

09:26.391 --> 09:27.567
Don't worry I'm
not sleeping here,

09:27.567 --> 09:29.046
I'm only dropping off Aubergine.

09:29.046 --> 09:31.309
[Schmae] Cameras
all over this villa.

09:31.309 --> 09:32.920
Rome here is also Italian,

09:32.920 --> 09:34.399
you should both
speak in Italian.

09:35.749 --> 09:36.924
Come on, you're
always telling people

09:36.924 --> 09:37.925
at school that you're Italian.

09:39.274 --> 09:40.928
- Just an eighth.
- Diluted.

09:40.928 --> 09:43.452
Like the pale moonlight,
or Aperol Spritz.

09:43.452 --> 09:45.846
The best things in
life are a subtle mix.

09:47.325 --> 09:50.720
Hey, do you know where
I can rent one of these?

09:50.720 --> 09:53.288
Oh no, not this.

09:53.288 --> 09:55.290
Something similar maybe.

09:55.290 --> 09:57.118
- This is the villa?
- [Leonardo] Not the same.

09:57.118 --> 09:59.381
This place sucks, it's
like an eighth of a villa.

09:59.381 --> 10:01.731
But you can borrow
this one, tomorrow.

10:01.731 --> 10:03.646
Meet me at La Sirena at 9?

10:03.646 --> 10:04.691
Okay, great.

10:04.691 --> 10:05.692
[engine starting]

10:07.084 --> 10:08.433
[engine accelerating]

10:10.218 --> 10:11.872
[Rome] What?

10:11.872 --> 10:13.700
What?

10:13.700 --> 10:15.179
Dude, you're going Vespa
riding with Leonardo, he's--

10:15.179 --> 10:16.703
- [Leo] Romeo, relax...
- He's trying to--

10:16.703 --> 10:18.966
The whole Vespa thing
is purely self serving.

10:18.966 --> 10:20.576
Yeah, I'm gonna use it,

10:20.576 --> 10:22.099
I'm also gonna find
out who this guy is.

10:22.099 --> 10:23.623
I mean, who the
fuck is Leonardo?

10:23.623 --> 10:25.189
Why is he so cozy
with your girl?

10:29.106 --> 10:30.586
That was some
pretty good acting.

10:32.414 --> 10:34.677
You know for a second there
I thought you were kind of...

10:35.635 --> 10:36.505
smitten with him.

10:37.985 --> 10:40.248
Don't even bring him
up tonight, be cool.

10:40.248 --> 10:41.684
Let me investigate.

10:41.684 --> 10:43.686
[tense music]

10:43.686 --> 10:45.906
[Narrator] Since Amber
Jane broke up with Rome,

10:45.906 --> 10:49.083
everyone knew he'd be
a mopey little bitch.

10:49.083 --> 10:53.087
But the boys could fix that
at the bar. This however...

10:53.087 --> 10:55.263
[Rome] So uh, where
did you meet Leonardo?

10:55.263 --> 10:56.090
Spring Break.

10:57.221 --> 10:59.049
Cool.

10:59.049 --> 11:01.922
I think it was that night
when you passed out at 5:12pm.

11:01.922 --> 11:04.664
[birds chirping]

11:05.708 --> 11:08.406
[whimsical music]

11:09.930 --> 11:11.671
Yeah, it was that night.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.369
We met when Claire
and I went dancing.

11:14.369 --> 11:17.241
Do you have a
problem, with dancing?

11:17.241 --> 11:19.809
No, I was just [clears
throat] wondering,

11:19.809 --> 11:22.072
since-- how he knew
where to pick you up.

11:22.072 --> 11:25.815
Well he's a friend, so
friends talk, message.

11:25.815 --> 11:27.469
Oh, so you're sending
him letters as well.

11:27.469 --> 11:29.514
No one sends letters, Rome.

11:29.514 --> 11:31.081
Only you with your
stupid typewriter

11:31.081 --> 11:33.780
think you're so
artistic, you're not.

11:33.780 --> 11:36.870
So you've been calling
Leonardo with your phone.

11:36.870 --> 11:38.828
We message each other online.

11:38.828 --> 11:40.221
What's the big deal?

11:40.221 --> 11:42.876
And yeah, now we text.

11:42.876 --> 11:44.486
What's the big deal?

11:44.486 --> 11:46.314
You're messaging some
sleazy Italian guy while

11:46.314 --> 11:49.709
you hijack my phone in the name
of some technological detox.

11:49.709 --> 11:53.190
While you message him, and
tell me that you still love me.

11:53.190 --> 11:55.192
Again, undermining my love.

11:55.192 --> 11:58.456
I wasted so much
time on you, Rome.

11:58.456 --> 12:01.068
I gave you everything
for four years

12:01.068 --> 12:03.113
and you don't even realize it.

12:03.113 --> 12:05.072
And I didn't use my phone.

12:05.072 --> 12:07.596
I didn't touch it
until we broke up.

12:07.596 --> 12:10.512
Yeah, we broke up.

12:10.512 --> 12:12.427
So stop harassing me.

12:12.427 --> 12:15.430
I didn't violate the detox, I
messaged him on the computer.

12:15.430 --> 12:18.738
Do you even understand how
stupid what you just said is?

12:18.738 --> 12:20.957
Or do you need Siri to
define technology for you?

12:22.611 --> 12:23.917
I can't stand you.

12:27.181 --> 12:29.052
Technically a typewriter is--

12:29.052 --> 12:31.054
Dan, I will fuck you in the
asshole on this tree house

12:31.054 --> 12:33.622
till you pass out and wake up
with another dick in your ass!

12:33.622 --> 12:35.537
Tact, Dan, tact!

12:35.537 --> 12:38.714
Listen, let's go down the
bar, talk everything out.

12:38.714 --> 12:41.369
Dan, sorry I exploded just
now, you can come too.

12:41.369 --> 12:42.805
Am I a terrible person?

12:42.805 --> 12:45.590
No buddy, it's way
more complex than that.

12:45.590 --> 12:47.157
Let's go talk it out.

12:47.157 --> 12:49.246
First, let's get out
of this tree house.

12:49.246 --> 12:51.553
I don't think I'm
gonna come tonight.

12:51.553 --> 12:55.252
I'm gonna take it easy
and just pace myself.

[dreamy music] [Leo] It's a
five day fucking vacation,

12:59.039 --> 13:00.997

13:02.999 --> 13:04.087
Of course we're back.

13:04.087 --> 13:05.393

a man who had it all...

You feel pity for me.
And you're nosy, huh?

You want to know
what Vicente Caudales

new, or to die.

dies, during the Estocada?

14:34.134 --> 14:38.399

shoulders, through the heart!

best part, yours?

Hey, um, I was wondering,

15:36.805 --> 15:39.286
do you wanna go on a
Vespa ride with me?

I'm borrowing that

15:42.550 --> 15:43.681
I don't know, could be fun.

deeper shit than that.

Okay, the names on the beds,

16:05.399 --> 16:07.923
I was just trying
to entertain myself.

16:07.923 --> 16:09.142
I can redraft the apartment

16:09.142 --> 16:10.970
but please don't
report me for...

16:12.319 --> 16:14.103

16:14.103 --> 16:16.888
So you assigned
two people per bed,

16:18.020 --> 16:19.587
Everyone knows you're a perv.

16:19.587 --> 16:21.981
I mean, you were voted
most likely to perv.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.548
Come to think of it, this
is probably your best shot

16:24.548 --> 16:26.376
to get with Claire.

16:26.376 --> 16:29.249
I've seen the way you look
at her. It's so creepy

16:29.249 --> 16:32.469
and quit walking so
close, she knows.

16:32.469 --> 16:35.995
Let's get serious, Leo,
your projects this semester

16:35.995 --> 16:39.259
have been well, superb.

16:39.259 --> 16:41.609
Maybe I didn't
challenge you enough.

16:41.609 --> 16:44.264
- It was enough. - I know
you're taking a gap year, okay?

16:44.264 --> 16:47.354
So you can drink and party

16:47.354 --> 16:51.140
and dance around on roller
skates with naked girls, okay?

16:51.140 --> 16:55.405
But, I really think you should
apply to architecture school.

16:55.405 --> 16:57.320
I'd be happy to recommend you.

16:57.320 --> 16:59.757
And in six months'
time if you focus,

16:59.757 --> 17:02.325
you can put together
a nice portfolio.

17:02.325 --> 17:06.590
My point is, you want
to have a good life.

Polotzi, really, but

my year of freedom,

one's ever gonna live in

like sand between my fingers.

17:20.735 --> 17:22.258
Ditto for my future.

next decade of my life

17:23.955 --> 17:25.740
working my way up the
architectural ladder

and grow disillusioned.

be an architect.

- Oh no.

insanely hot girl

banged her, and she's cool.

for a better rebound?

you're set for life

someone on the first night,

a fucking bitch.

we get back to school.

seeing Leonardo,

about Spring Break

we leave Santa Lorena.

trust in me for good reason.

all they do is get drunk

that night, but now I don't.

know that Romulus

tell him exactly--

up too much resistance.

fade into forgetfulness?

that life was theirs.

enhances its splendor.

Wasn't hard either.

No. And I'm not
telling him either.

39:21.750 --> 39:22.577
[footsteps fading]

39:22.577 --> 39:23.404
[birds chirping]

39:25.711 --> 39:26.799
[leaves rustling]

39:29.149 --> 39:30.368
Can I talk to you?

39:33.414 --> 39:36.504
[introspective music]

39:36.504 --> 39:37.723
[birds chirping]

39:38.941 --> 39:42.597
[introspective music]

39:52.912 --> 39:54.914
[Amber Jane] Chapel tower.

39:54.914 --> 39:56.263
[Rome] Twice.

39:56.263 --> 39:57.612
Music rooms.

39:57.612 --> 39:59.875
[Amber Jane] Many times.
[both chuckle]

40:01.355 --> 40:02.878
Do you remember the very
first time we kissed?

40:02.878 --> 40:06.882
Of course, it was
freshman year, snowing.

40:08.362 --> 40:09.885
You know I made it
to check-in on time?

40:10.886 --> 40:12.845
From Willard Hall,

40:12.845 --> 40:14.760
in one minute,

40:14.760 --> 40:15.761
I don't think I'll run half
as fast the rest of my life.

40:15.761 --> 40:16.892
Rome, I miss you.

40:21.593 --> 40:23.203
This whole semester has been--

40:25.597 --> 40:27.729
How can you say
something like that?

40:27.729 --> 40:30.471
And then at times be so
scathing, denigrating.

40:30.471 --> 40:32.908
Stop using SAT words.

40:32.908 --> 40:36.434
They're not SAT words,
they're just, words.

40:37.913 --> 40:39.698
You say don't love me
anymore, Amber Jane.

40:41.003 --> 40:42.352
And now you say you miss me.

40:43.658 --> 40:46.356
It's, it's a little crazy.

40:46.356 --> 40:47.183
It is.

40:48.228 --> 40:49.055
It is.

40:52.058 --> 40:53.973
I'm sorry, Rome.

40:55.409 --> 40:57.237
[introspective music]

41:12.905 --> 41:13.906
I need to know.

41:15.342 --> 41:17.126
What's the real
story with Leonardo?

41:18.388 --> 41:19.694
You're always so jealous.

41:22.697 --> 41:24.046
Listen, it's fine.

41:26.396 --> 41:30.052
I forgive your jealousy, it
just means you care about me.

41:33.316 --> 41:34.840
Let's go back to the villa.

41:37.059 --> 41:38.844
I want you to ravish me.

41:40.410 --> 41:42.064
[whispers] It's an
eighth of a villa.

41:42.064 --> 41:44.023
Shh.

41:44.023 --> 41:47.113
[whimsical music]

41:47.113 --> 41:49.724
[footsteps approaching]

41:49.724 --> 41:51.552
[birds chirping]

41:53.902 --> 41:55.382
[bell ringing]

41:58.080 --> 42:00.300
[Leo moaning]

42:00.300 --> 42:02.215
[Leo] Am I doing this right?

42:02.215 --> 42:03.042
Perfect.

42:05.740 --> 42:06.959
Maybe a little faster?

42:08.047 --> 42:09.222
Okay.

42:09.222 --> 42:10.528
[moaning]
[bed creaking]

42:11.485 --> 42:12.878
[both moaning]

42:12.878 --> 42:14.836
- Perfect
- I need to slow down.

42:16.882 --> 42:18.623
[frame creaking]

42:20.363 --> 42:22.365
[bed clattering]
[both panting]

42:22.365 --> 42:24.150
[foot thud]

42:24.150 --> 42:25.934
[Leo] They banned this in Spain.
They banned this in Spain.

42:25.934 --> 42:28.415
Charles Dickens,
Charles Dickens,

42:28.415 --> 42:30.373
Charles Dickens!

42:30.373 --> 42:31.200
Shit.

42:34.639 --> 42:36.902
[whimsical music]

42:46.868 --> 42:47.869
[door shuts]

43:01.361 --> 43:02.188
[wood creaks]

43:12.328 --> 43:13.503
[deep sighing]

43:18.813 --> 43:20.293
[grunts, taps]

43:26.038 --> 43:28.693
[frenzied footsteps]

43:34.046 --> 43:34.960
[door slams]

43:35.961 --> 43:39.312
[Claire laughing]

43:39.312 --> 43:40.618
She's seriously gotten
dumber since she started

43:40.618 --> 43:42.097
hooking up with Leo.

43:42.097 --> 43:43.272
[Claire laughing]

43:43.272 --> 43:45.013
It's like the head of a beluga.

43:45.013 --> 43:46.536
[Claire laughing]

43:46.536 --> 43:49.061
I bet he'll die during
his gap year. O.D.

43:50.149 --> 43:51.324
He's my best friend.

43:51.324 --> 43:52.847
I know but, you'll see.

43:54.240 --> 43:55.633
Fine for high school
but, you know.

43:57.286 --> 43:58.244
I don't actually.

43:59.985 --> 44:03.249
I don't think he's bright
enough for you, okay?

44:03.249 --> 44:05.164
It's a compliment.

44:05.164 --> 44:08.341
You should be friends with
people of a certain level.

44:08.341 --> 44:09.168
You like it?

44:10.560 --> 44:12.606
I got it at your
little friend's store.

44:12.606 --> 44:14.826
Cheap stuff but
what can you expect?

44:14.826 --> 44:17.176
It's Santa Lorena, not Milan.

44:19.744 --> 44:23.008
Come here, I want
you to rip it off me.

44:26.533 --> 44:30.145
No, no.

44:35.629 --> 44:37.718
Look we broke up,
Amber Jane, okay?

44:38.676 --> 44:39.633
You broke up with me.

44:41.200 --> 44:42.810
I think we should
stay broken up.

44:44.682 --> 44:46.596
[sighing]

44:46.596 --> 44:50.035
I mean, how can you be so
disparaging of your friend

44:50.035 --> 44:51.210
and my best friend?

44:53.429 --> 44:56.606
No, I don't want to rip
off Giorgia's swimsuit.

45:00.219 --> 45:01.176
This was a mistake.

45:04.484 --> 45:06.791
[gasping]

45:06.791 --> 45:08.357
[door slams]

45:08.357 --> 45:11.143
[indignant panting]

45:11.143 --> 45:14.973
You're oblivious, stupid.

45:14.973 --> 45:16.626
[headrest bangs]

45:16.626 --> 45:18.628
[pillow thud]
[indistinct grievance]

45:19.673 --> 45:20.500
[Amber Jane] Rome?

45:22.632 --> 45:25.026
Pssst, what's going on?

45:27.333 --> 45:28.160
Nothing.

45:29.814 --> 45:31.729
I think I'm finally
over Amber Jane.

45:33.774 --> 45:34.644
Come in.

45:36.255 --> 45:37.299
Centipede style?

45:38.431 --> 45:41.260
[upbeat music]

45:48.920 --> 45:50.748
It's dick time.

45:50.748 --> 45:52.662
[singing in Italian]

45:56.666 --> 45:58.190
[Unremarkable Dan] Get
the fuck off of me!

45:59.931 --> 46:01.889
[footsteps pattering]
[both struggling]

46:01.889 --> 46:03.151
[grunting]

46:03.151 --> 46:04.239
[Schmae] Fucking bitch.

46:05.763 --> 46:06.894
Fucking bitch!

46:08.591 --> 46:11.159
[upbeat music]
[singing in Italian]

46:19.428 --> 46:21.953
I know, I'm more
off-putting during the day.

46:24.042 --> 46:25.434
I have something for you.

46:30.918 --> 46:32.485
I love it.

46:32.485 --> 46:34.139
[bells ringing]

46:34.139 --> 46:36.358
[Rome] I need to confess
something that happened.

46:36.358 --> 46:41.363
This morning, Amber Jane, my
ex, she wanted to talk, so.

46:42.800 --> 46:46.586
We talked about stuff,
the past, et cetera.

46:48.370 --> 46:52.810
And then she kissed me.
And I resisted, at first,

46:54.289 --> 46:57.205
but then I kissed her
back for a little while.

46:59.599 --> 47:01.340
But then I realized, you
know, it was a big mistake

47:01.340 --> 47:03.168
and we're not right
for each other.

47:03.168 --> 47:04.909
Look, I know you probably
don't care about this,

47:04.909 --> 47:06.475
'cause you're super
liberal about these things,

47:06.475 --> 47:09.478
but I just wanted
to tell you, since.

47:09.478 --> 47:11.611
You know, we've been hanging
out these last two days

47:11.611 --> 47:12.786
which has been great.

47:14.135 --> 47:15.571
I'm not with her anymore.

47:17.922 --> 47:19.445
I'm sorry.

47:19.445 --> 47:21.142
We're not boyfriend
and girlfriend.

47:21.142 --> 47:25.103
I mean, you don't, you
don't have to apologize.

47:27.845 --> 47:28.671
Okay.

47:30.848 --> 47:33.807
Can I still see you
today or maybe tonight?

47:33.807 --> 47:34.634
Not today.

47:35.765 --> 47:37.158
[Giorgia] I'll see you around.

47:41.162 --> 47:43.338
Thank you for the drawing.

47:43.338 --> 47:45.906
[gentle music]

47:58.788 --> 47:59.789
[sighing]

47:59.789 --> 48:02.357
[gentle music]

48:11.497 --> 48:13.847
[sea lapping]

48:59.066 --> 49:00.024
You keep a diary?

49:00.981 --> 49:02.461
Kind of.

49:02.461 --> 49:04.942
With like, your feelings?

49:04.942 --> 49:06.552
[Claire chuckling]

49:06.552 --> 49:08.423
Sometimes.

49:08.423 --> 49:12.210
Usually events, special
times I want to remember.

49:12.210 --> 49:13.211
Can I read it?

49:14.429 --> 49:15.953
You can read this page.

49:17.302 --> 49:18.781
You're in it.

49:18.781 --> 49:20.435
[Claire chuckling]

49:20.435 --> 49:21.959
You see, in 10 years,

49:21.959 --> 49:24.526
I would have forgotten
all about this trip.

49:24.526 --> 49:28.530
Or maybe have some vague
memory of it, you know,

49:28.530 --> 49:30.010
the vacation with the Vespa.

49:30.010 --> 49:31.838
[Claire chuckling]

49:31.838 --> 49:35.885
So this diary is a sort
of door to the past.

49:36.886 --> 49:38.062
A way to access it.

49:39.846 --> 49:42.631
And when I open to this page,

49:42.631 --> 49:43.458
I'll remember,

49:45.460 --> 49:48.072
the Vespa and the spritz,

49:48.072 --> 49:50.248
sunbathing with Amber Jane.

49:51.858 --> 49:52.859
Leo.

49:55.949 --> 49:58.734
You should try keeping a
diary during your gap year.

49:58.734 --> 49:59.953
Yeah, maybe.

50:02.956 --> 50:04.305
Can I read the whole thing?

50:04.305 --> 50:06.046
No.

50:06.046 --> 50:08.396
There are definitely
embarrassing things in here.

50:08.396 --> 50:09.963
Boys from the past.

50:09.963 --> 50:10.964
[both laughing]

50:10.964 --> 50:12.226
Now I have to read it.

50:12.226 --> 50:14.011
No.
[Claire laughing]

50:14.011 --> 50:15.316
I have a proposition.

50:17.014 --> 50:20.191
I'll open the diary and whatever
I land on, I can read it.

50:22.889 --> 50:23.803
Fine.

50:25.239 --> 50:26.197
[Claire titters]

50:30.070 --> 50:32.551
- Oh no no no that's too
embarrassing. - Wait wait wait.

50:35.858 --> 50:38.252
[wistful music]

50:38.252 --> 50:40.863
A library, with walnut floors.

50:40.863 --> 50:42.082
[water splashing]

50:42.082 --> 50:43.736
All I wanted was
to get with her.

50:45.390 --> 50:48.349
Now that I did, I
realize I don't have her.

50:50.047 --> 50:53.137
Soon, I'll just be
another guy from the past.

50:55.008 --> 50:56.314
A page in her diary.

50:58.490 --> 51:00.057
I think you should appreciate

51:00.057 --> 51:01.710
that she even lets
you talk to her.

51:01.710 --> 51:04.365
The fact you've
been inside her...

51:05.671 --> 51:07.760
blows my fucking mind.

51:09.457 --> 51:11.068
You want too much.

51:11.068 --> 51:13.592
But hey, if you really want it,

51:13.592 --> 51:15.594
you're gonna have
to work for it.

51:15.594 --> 51:16.682
[tapping]

51:18.249 --> 51:19.815
You're wise.

51:19.815 --> 51:23.732
If I were really wise,
I'd be fucking rich.

51:23.732 --> 51:25.647
[film camera rolling]

51:32.785 --> 51:34.526
[memory chimes]

51:37.181 --> 51:40.053
[water splashing]

51:49.106 --> 51:52.631
[tense suspenseful music]

52:04.730 --> 52:05.687
[pebbles moving]

52:08.821 --> 52:10.127
Vicente! Vicente!

52:10.127 --> 52:11.824
Don't do it!

52:11.824 --> 52:13.695
I have nothing to live for.

52:13.695 --> 52:14.914
Stop, stop okay?

52:14.914 --> 52:16.263
[Rome panting]

52:17.438 --> 52:18.439
[tense suspenseful music]

52:18.439 --> 52:21.138
Look, I'll do it, okay?

52:22.574 --> 52:27.100
I'll perform the,
Estocada on you, okay?

52:27.100 --> 52:28.406
So you can die with honor.

52:30.451 --> 52:31.365
Like the bulls?

52:32.540 --> 52:34.238
Yeah, yeah like the bulls.

52:37.589 --> 52:38.503
I am listening.

52:40.244 --> 52:43.421
I can stab you through
the nape, into your heart.

52:43.421 --> 52:44.726
That's not a problem.

52:46.511 --> 52:50.297
But, first I've gotta go
back and change, you know?

52:50.297 --> 52:53.170
Ah, I have to be wearing my
finest attire, to honor you.

52:53.170 --> 52:55.041
You know. Like you
honor the bulls.

52:55.041 --> 52:56.825
Of course, of course.

52:56.825 --> 52:59.654
And plus, I mean, it's
flood tide right now, right?

52:59.654 --> 53:01.482
So you're body's just
gonna end up on the rocks.

53:01.482 --> 53:03.397
Wait for the tide
to be going out

53:03.397 --> 53:05.921
so you'll be carried into the
Mediterranean Sea, with honor.

53:05.921 --> 53:06.879
Like the beluga?

53:08.576 --> 53:11.231
Yeah, yeah like the beluga.

53:11.231 --> 53:13.015
You know, and there's
also less chance

53:13.015 --> 53:14.669
of me being arrested for
homicide which is always a plus.

53:17.324 --> 53:18.282
[inhales deeply]
Okay.

53:19.761 --> 53:22.677
Estocada, when the
lower arc of the sun

53:22.677 --> 53:24.679
is 15 degrees from horizon.

53:25.767 --> 53:26.594
Okay.

53:28.117 --> 53:31.425
And hey, if you don't
kill me, I am jumping.

53:33.819 --> 53:35.864
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

53:37.257 --> 53:38.737
[tense dramatic music]

53:38.737 --> 53:39.868
[footsteps approaching]

53:39.868 --> 53:42.131
What the fuck.

53:42.131 --> 53:44.221
[tense dramatic music]

53:47.876 --> 53:51.837
[fast running patter]

53:53.230 --> 53:54.318
[raps on glass]

53:56.624 --> 53:58.322
Rome please, not today.

53:59.758 --> 54:00.933
[Rome heaving]

54:00.933 --> 54:03.283
This has nothing to do with us.

54:03.283 --> 54:06.895
Vicente Caudales, is
going to kill himself.

54:07.940 --> 54:09.115
[footsteps approaching]

54:09.115 --> 54:10.943
[tense dramatic music]

54:44.629 --> 54:45.804
[door booming]

1:08:31.194 --> 1:08:33.109
I guess I go to college.

1:08:35.502 --> 1:08:36.895
I should have taken
that gap year.

1:08:38.331 --> 1:08:39.550
Could defer for a year.

1:08:40.594 --> 1:08:42.466
I have a better idea.

1:08:42.466 --> 1:08:46.165
Why don't we stay together
for the next few days?

1:08:48.994 --> 1:08:49.821
That's it?

1:08:50.996 --> 1:08:51.823
That's it.

1:08:54.608 --> 1:08:57.350
But you can't kiss your ex
girlfriend in these two days.

1:08:57.350 --> 1:08:59.352
Okay, well you can't
kiss the toreador.

1:09:00.440 --> 1:09:02.225
But what if he's on the edge?

1:09:02.225 --> 1:09:03.487
You gotta let him jump.

1:09:03.487 --> 1:09:05.141
Okay, deal. Deal deal.

1:09:05.141 --> 1:09:07.752
[dreamy music]

1:09:10.407 --> 1:09:13.801
[Narrator] The next two
days were, well, magic.

1:09:14.802 --> 1:09:16.369
[dreamy music]

1:09:28.990 --> 1:09:30.992
So, you see that?

1:09:30.992 --> 1:09:32.820
That's what you're hearing.

1:09:32.820 --> 1:09:34.605
Damn, that's a lot of work.

1:09:34.605 --> 1:09:37.564
You don't get,
restless, being indoors,

1:09:37.564 --> 1:09:39.087
doing this for hours?

1:09:39.087 --> 1:09:39.958
I like it.

1:09:41.873 --> 1:09:43.614
[gentle music]

1:09:55.191 --> 1:09:56.714
[Narrator] It was a dream.

1:09:58.542 --> 1:10:01.501
And Rome knew that
it was going to end.

1:10:01.501 --> 1:10:03.590
[gentle music]

1:10:03.590 --> 1:10:06.027
Even though he
agreed to the terms,

1:10:06.027 --> 1:10:08.334
to the transient
nature of their love.

1:10:09.857 --> 1:10:11.337
I'm not sure Rome
quite accepted it.

1:10:13.121 --> 1:10:14.993
I'll miss you, Leo.

1:10:14.993 --> 1:10:16.429
[Narrator] And perhaps Leo
and Claire felt it too.

1:10:16.429 --> 1:10:18.736
Please don't die
during your gap year.

1:10:18.736 --> 1:10:20.868
You decided what
you're gonna do yet?

1:10:20.868 --> 1:10:21.695
Yep.

1:10:23.654 --> 1:10:25.221
I have plans.

1:10:25.221 --> 1:10:28.572
Well, send me a
postcard at least.

1:10:28.572 --> 1:10:31.488
[footsteps fading]

1:10:51.508 --> 1:10:54.859
[footsteps pattering]

1:10:56.904 --> 1:10:57.949
Hello, friend.

1:10:59.255 --> 1:11:01.431
Vicente, you look good.

1:11:03.259 --> 1:11:07.306
I came to thank you
for saving my life.

1:11:08.176 --> 1:11:09.569
[exhales deeply]

1:11:09.569 --> 1:11:10.614
My gift to you.

1:11:13.878 --> 1:11:15.009
Is heavy.

1:11:15.009 --> 1:11:16.446
[Rome chuckling]

1:11:18.970 --> 1:11:20.101
You can do anything.

1:11:21.233 --> 1:11:23.496
Keep it, sell it, is yours.

1:11:25.672 --> 1:11:28.284
Don't sell it for
less than 20,000.

1:11:28.284 --> 1:11:29.285
[emotional music]

1:11:29.285 --> 1:11:30.851
So, what's next for you?

1:11:32.375 --> 1:11:34.290
You're still nosy, huh?

1:11:34.290 --> 1:11:37.510
You want to know what Vicente
Caudales is going to do, huh?

1:11:37.510 --> 1:11:38.990
[sighs]

1:11:38.990 --> 1:11:41.079
I will tour all
Mediterranean Islands.

1:11:42.472 --> 1:11:46.040
Festivals, parties,
and discover new music.

1:11:47.738 --> 1:11:49.043
Sounds like a good plan.

1:11:49.043 --> 1:11:51.611
[emotional music]

1:12:18.072 --> 1:12:19.335
[car door creaking]

1:12:20.379 --> 1:12:22.163
You guys weren't so terrible.

1:12:23.251 --> 1:12:24.601
That means a lot, buddy.

1:12:24.601 --> 1:12:27.038
It's been a great mini vacation.

1:12:27.038 --> 1:12:29.127
Now get to work, asshole.

1:12:38.092 --> 1:12:39.485
[emotional music]

1:12:45.186 --> 1:12:47.624
Can you really come
back this summer?

1:12:47.624 --> 1:12:48.755
And then what?

1:12:52.106 --> 1:12:53.978
[kissing]

1:13:36.237 --> 1:13:38.414
Are we coming back
to Santa Lorena?

1:13:38.414 --> 1:13:39.458
[phone dings]

1:13:43.941 --> 1:13:44.942
Let's go graduate,

1:13:46.378 --> 1:13:47.510
and come straight
back to Santa Lorena.

1:13:47.510 --> 1:13:48.380
Yes!

1:13:49.816 --> 1:13:51.557
[car engine roaring]
[uplifting music]

1:13:51.557 --> 1:13:53.080
So this was only the
pregame. Who's coming back?

1:13:54.168 --> 1:13:55.431
Dan, tell me you're coming back.

1:13:55.431 --> 1:13:57.084
You can DJ, I'll event plan.

1:13:57.084 --> 1:13:58.738
We can make millions.

1:13:58.738 --> 1:14:00.958
DJ name? Unremarkable Dan.

1:14:00.958 --> 1:14:02.438
Remarkable Dan.

1:14:02.438 --> 1:14:03.830
DJ Dan.

1:14:03.830 --> 1:14:05.615
[Claire laughing]

1:14:05.615 --> 1:14:08.095
That's pretty unremarkable
but kind of awesome.

1:14:09.923 --> 1:14:11.708
[engine roaring]

1:14:11.708 --> 1:14:14.885
[Narrator] While memory
is a comforting access

1:14:14.885 --> 1:14:15.886
to the past,

1:14:17.627 --> 1:14:20.412
it is also a cruel reminder
of its inaccessibility.

1:14:21.848 --> 1:14:25.896
Everything ends.
The tide recedes.

1:14:25.896 --> 1:14:29.465
But we are made of those
impressions, like barnacles,

1:14:29.465 --> 1:14:31.684
brushed by the ancient sea.

1:14:31.684 --> 1:14:35.688
Holding on between the
past and the future.

1:14:37.168 --> 1:14:39.039
[Leo] So Ms. Polotzi,

1:14:39.039 --> 1:14:41.781
I think I will need that
recommendation after all.

1:14:41.781 --> 1:14:44.218
I'm applying to
architecture school.

1:14:44.218 --> 1:14:47.700
I sent you a copy of my designs
for Claire's dream house,

1:14:47.700 --> 1:14:49.746
no need to inform
the authorities,

1:14:49.746 --> 1:14:51.487
Claire knows all about it.

1:14:51.487 --> 1:14:53.489
In fact, she's
with me right now.

1:14:54.968 --> 1:14:56.143
We're spending a
few days together

1:14:56.143 --> 1:14:57.710
before I get back on the road.

1:14:57.710 --> 1:15:00.496
So far, I haven't
screwed things up.

1:15:00.496 --> 1:15:02.454
But I'll keep you posted.

1:15:02.454 --> 1:15:04.369
Love, Leo.

1:15:04.369 --> 1:15:06.937
[uplifting music]

1:15:08.329 --> 1:15:09.766
I told you she wanted my dick.

1:15:09.766 --> 1:15:13.291
[upbeat music]
[singing in Italian]

1:16:42.554 --> 1:16:43.642
[plastic bag rustling]

1:16:43.642 --> 1:16:44.948
[speaking Spanish]
