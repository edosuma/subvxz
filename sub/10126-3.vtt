WEBVTT

00:20.700 --> 00:22.000
ALL RIGHT,
I'M GOING TO
DO SOMETHING

00:22.000 --> 00:25.700
I HAVEN'T DONE
IN A VERY LONG TIME.
HOLD ME, MOMMY!

00:25.700 --> 00:28.734
ERIC, YOU ONLY APPLIED
FOR ONE JOB.

00:28.734 --> 00:30.300
THERE'S PLENTY MORE
OUT THERE.

00:30.300 --> 00:33.100
IT WASN'T JUST ANY JOB.
IT WAS THE GAP.

00:33.100 --> 00:36.500
I MEAN, IF ANYBODY
SHOULD BE WORKING
AT THE GAP, IT'S ME.

00:36.500 --> 00:38.000
I MEAN, LOOK. I'M GAP!

00:38.000 --> 00:42.300
ALL GAP! EVEN WHEN
I'M IN THE SHOWER,
I'M GAP!

00:42.300 --> 00:45.133
YOU DIDN'T PUT THAT
ON YOUR APPLICATION,
DID YOU?

00:45.133 --> 00:47.000
NO. THEY SAID
I WASN'T QUALIFIED.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.600
I TOLD THEM A MONKEY
COULD WORK THERE.

00:49.600 --> 00:51.100
MOM, IT WAS
THE WEIRDEST THING.

00:51.100 --> 00:52.600
LAST NIGHT,
I'M WALKING BY THE GAP.

00:52.600 --> 00:55.834
THEY GOT A MONKEY
SELLING JEANS.

00:55.834 --> 00:57.400
I GAVE THEM
THAT IDEA.

00:57.400 --> 00:59.000
WELL, NEXT TIME YOU
GO OUT FOR A JOB,

00:59.000 --> 01:01.934
WEAR A DIAPER
AND SMOKE A CIGAR.

01:01.934 --> 01:04.667
PEOPLE LIKE THAT.

01:04.667 --> 01:06.367
Alan: UGH!

01:06.367 --> 01:07.367
MORNING.

01:07.367 --> 01:10.967
HEY, DAD, I NEED $25
FOR A CLASS PICTURE.

01:10.967 --> 01:13.400
$25? HOW BIG
IS YOUR CLASS?

01:13.400 --> 01:14.400
EVERYONE ELSE PAID.

01:14.400 --> 01:16.200
THE TEACHER SAID
IF I DON'T PAY TODAY,

01:16.200 --> 01:18.567
THEY'RE GOING TO
AIRBRUSH ME OUT.

01:18.567 --> 01:19.800
FINE, FINE.
TAKE, TAKE.

01:19.800 --> 01:23.567
OH, DAD,
KEEP YOUR WALLET OPEN.
I GOT PICTURES, TOO.

01:23.567 --> 01:25.200
WHAT GRADE
ARE YOU IN?

01:25.200 --> 01:26.200
11th.

01:26.200 --> 01:28.000
WE GOT ENOUGH
OF YOU.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
ALAN!

01:29.000 --> 01:31.734
FINE, FINE.
TAKE, TAKE.

01:31.734 --> 01:33.567
I'LL WORK SUNDAYS.

01:33.567 --> 01:34.600
I'LL WORK SUNDAYS?

01:34.600 --> 01:38.033
I'M NOT THRILLED
WORKING THERE WEEKDAYS.

01:39.200 --> 01:43.133
AMY, I'M DOING SOMETHING
ABOUT MY JOB.

01:43.133 --> 01:44.367
DAD, YOU CAN'T QUIT.

01:44.367 --> 01:49.367
I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS FAMILY.
I AM NOT A MONKEY!

01:54.567 --> 01:57.967
AMY...I'M GOING TO ASK
FOR A RAISE.

01:57.967 --> 02:00.667
IS THAT
WHAT YOU THINK
WILL MAKE YOU HAPPY?

02:00.667 --> 02:02.100
HAPPIER THAN I AM NOW,

02:02.100 --> 02:04.233
AND I'M NOT COMING BACK
INTO THIS HOUSE

02:04.233 --> 02:06.300
UNTIL I GET IT.

02:09.667 --> 02:13.667
MOM, WHY IS DAD
STANDING OUTSIDE
THE HOUSE?

02:18.133 --> 02:19.700
YOU DIDN'T GET IT.

02:19.700 --> 02:20.700
NO, I GOT IT.

02:20.700 --> 02:22.500
I WALKED IN.
I SAID TO PETE,

02:22.500 --> 02:23.500
"PETE,
WE GOT TO TALK."

02:23.500 --> 02:25.367
HE SAID,
"ALAN, NOTHING
TO TALK ABOUT.

02:25.367 --> 02:27.033
HOW IS $5,000?"

02:27.033 --> 02:28.200
$5,000? COME INSIDE.

02:28.200 --> 02:29.600
SIT IN A<i>NICE </i>CHAIR.

02:29.600 --> 02:32.100
AMY, I THINK I COULD HAVE
GOTTEN EVEN MORE.

02:32.100 --> 02:35.967
THEN SIT
IN THE NICE CHAIR
AND USE THE NICE PHONE.

02:35.967 --> 02:37.400
CALL PETE
AND ASK FOR IT.

02:37.400 --> 02:41.300
ACTUALLY, I DON'T THINK
CALLING PETE WOULD MAKE
MUCH SENSE.

02:41.300 --> 02:42.567
WHY NOT?

02:42.567 --> 02:46.467
BECAUSE I DON'T
WORK THERE ANYMORE, AMY.
I QUIT.

02:48.567 --> 02:50.767
WOULD YOU PASS
THE POTATOES?

02:55.300 --> 02:59.600
Eric: DAD, YOU QUIT YOUR JOB?
Cory: WE'RE GOING TO BE POOR.

02:59.600 --> 03:01.834
WE'RE NOT
GOING TO BE POOR.

03:01.834 --> 03:04.400
ALAN, HOW COULD YOU
QUIT YOUR JOB

03:04.400 --> 03:06.500
WITHOUT EVEN
DISCUSSING IT WITH ME?

03:06.500 --> 03:07.800
WE'RE
DISCUSSING IT NOW.

03:07.800 --> 03:10.800
OH, SO NO DECISION
WAS ACTUALLY MADE?

03:10.800 --> 03:12.567
UH, NO. A DECISION
WAS MADE.

03:12.567 --> 03:15.100
NOW IT'S TIME
FOR THE VERY
IMPORTANT DISCUSSION

03:15.100 --> 03:19.100
THAT FOLLOWS
THE MAKING
OF THE DECISION.

03:19.100 --> 03:19.934
ALAN, IF WE HAD
DISCUSSED THIS

03:19.934 --> 03:21.500
BEFORE A DECISION
WAS MADE,

03:21.500 --> 03:23.200
I MIGHT HAVE
GENTLY POINTED OUT

03:23.200 --> 03:27.200
THAT WE HAVE
CHILDREN TO FEED
AND BILLS TO PAY.

03:27.200 --> 03:29.667
BYE-BYE, CAR.

03:29.667 --> 03:32.100
AMY, I WOULD NEVER
PUT THIS FAMILY AT RISK.

03:32.100 --> 03:33.767
WE HAVE A LITTLE MONEY
SAVED UP,

03:33.767 --> 03:35.800
AND ONE DAY I HOPE TO GO
INTO BUSINESS FOR MYSELF.

03:35.800 --> 03:38.000
THAT WAY ERIC
COULD COME WORK FOR ME.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.200
HEY! YOU HEAR THAT?
I'M GOING TO BE
RESPONSIBLE

03:40.200 --> 03:42.100
FOR THE WELL-BEING
OF THIS FAMILY.

03:42.100 --> 03:44.200
BYE-BYE, HOUSE.

03:45.734 --> 03:47.900
SO YOU SEE, AMY,
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

03:47.900 --> 03:50.567
I MADE A GOOD DECISION.

03:50.567 --> 03:53.600
FINE, FINE.
I MADE ONE, TOO.

03:53.600 --> 03:56.900
WHAT? WHAT DECISION
DID YOU MAKE?

03:56.900 --> 04:00.300
WELL, THAT IF
YOU'RE ALLOWED TO MAKE
A UNILATERAL DECISION

04:00.300 --> 04:03.600
ABOUT SOMETHING
WHICH AFFECTS
THIS ENTIRE FAMILY,

04:03.600 --> 04:05.300
THEN SO AM I.

04:05.300 --> 04:07.900
WELL, WHAT DECISION
ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE?

04:07.900 --> 04:08.934
I DON'T KNOW YET.

04:08.934 --> 04:11.667
BUT ONE DAY,
I WILL MAKE
A DECISION

04:11.667 --> 04:14.767
WHICH AFFECTS
THIS ENTIRE FAMILY
BECAUSE YOU DID,

04:14.767 --> 04:18.467
AND OUR RELATIONSHIP
IS AN EQUAL
PARTNERSHIP,

04:18.467 --> 04:19.500
ISN'T IT?

04:19.500 --> 04:22.500
[SUSPICIOUSLY]
YES.

04:22.500 --> 04:23.967
BUT DON'T YOU WORRY

04:23.967 --> 04:27.867
BECAUSE I'LL TALK IT
OVER WITH YOU
AFTERWARDS.

04:30.567 --> 04:34.500
AND THAT'S
THE WHOLE SAD MESS
I FIND MYSELF IN.

04:34.500 --> 04:38.200
WOW! AND TO THINK,
YOU WERE MY ONLY
RICH FRIEND.

04:38.200 --> 04:40.100
COMFORTABLE,
NEVER RICH.

04:40.100 --> 04:41.367
INDOOR PLUMBING?
RICH.

04:41.367 --> 04:43.734
WELL, WHATEVER WE WERE,
SHAWN, WE'RE NOT ANYMORE.

04:43.734 --> 04:47.367
YOU KNOW,
I NEVER REALIZED
HOW EASY I HAD IT.

04:47.367 --> 04:48.934
YOU HAD IT EASY,
ALL RIGHT.

04:48.934 --> 04:50.967
YOU,
WITH YOUR BREAKFASTS
IN THE MORNING,

04:50.967 --> 04:54.200
YOUR LUNCHES
IN THE AFTERNOON,
YOUR DINNERS AT NIGHT.

04:54.200 --> 04:56.934
EATERS! YOU'RE EATERS!

04:56.934 --> 04:59.200
SHAWN,
THEY PUT THE FOOD
IN FRONT OF ME.

04:59.200 --> 05:01.500
THAT'S OK. COOL.
YOU'RE MY FRIEND,

05:01.500 --> 05:03.500
AND I'M GOING
TO TEACH YOU
HOW TO BE POOR.

05:03.500 --> 05:04.500
WOULD YOU?

05:04.500 --> 05:06.100
WELL, IT'S NOT GOING
TO BE EASY.

05:06.100 --> 05:07.900
YOU COME FROM A WORLD
OF MANY PANTS.

05:07.900 --> 05:10.033
THEY PUT THE PANTS
IN FRONT OF ME.

05:10.033 --> 05:12.100
NOW, DON'T TURN
YOUR BACK ON ME.

05:12.100 --> 05:13.400
OK, CORY.
YOU SOUND SINCERE.

05:13.400 --> 05:14.834
LET ME ASK YOU
ONE QUESTION.

05:14.834 --> 05:17.200
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SLEPT INSIDE?

05:17.200 --> 05:18.233
LAST NIGHT.

05:18.233 --> 05:20.300
I CAN'T WORK WITH YOU.

05:20.300 --> 05:23.900
HEY, HOW ARE YOU?
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN A WHILE.

05:23.900 --> 05:25.600
HEY, YOU DO THAT THEN,
ALL RIGHT?

05:25.600 --> 05:28.100
AND YOU. I'M NOT
TALKING TO YOU. OK.

05:28.100 --> 05:31.700
HEY, MR. FEENY.
HOW'S IT GOING
BY AND BY?

05:31.700 --> 05:34.033
FINE, BY AND BY.

05:34.033 --> 05:35.934
SO, MR. MATTHEWS,
HOW DOES IT FEEL

05:35.934 --> 05:38.200
TO BE BACK
IN THE OLD SCHOOL HALL?

05:38.200 --> 05:39.500
THEY MISS ME,
DON'T THEY?

05:39.500 --> 05:41.734
OH, YES. WE'VE BROUGHT IN
A CRISIS COUNSELOR

05:41.734 --> 05:43.734
TO HELP THE STUDENTS
DEAL WITH THEIR LOSS.

05:43.734 --> 05:48.200
WELL, I THINK THAT'S
A GREAT WAY TO BEGIN
THE HEALING PROCESS.

05:48.200 --> 05:49.400
OH, YOU WEREN'T SERIOUS.

05:49.400 --> 05:50.767
NO.

05:50.767 --> 05:53.800
I TAKE IT
YOU'RE HERE TO SET UP
A TUTORING SCHEDULE.

05:53.800 --> 05:55.734
WELL, YOU KNOW, I WAS,
BUT NOW, MR. FEENY,

05:55.734 --> 05:58.800
I REALLY DON'T THINK
TUTORING'S GOING TO BE
NECESSARY FOR ME.

05:58.800 --> 06:00.100
NOW, ERIC,
I THOUGHT WE AGREED

06:00.100 --> 06:02.734
THAT COLLEGES
LOOK FAVORABLY
ON STUDENTS

06:02.734 --> 06:05.900
WHO ACKNOWLEDGE
THEIR SCHOLASTIC
SHORTCOMINGS

06:05.900 --> 06:07.400
AND TRY TO RECTIFY
THEM.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.967
WHATEVER.
BUT YOU KNOW, MY DAD
HAS ACTUALLY DECIDED

06:09.967 --> 06:11.300
TO START
A FAMILY BUSINESS

06:11.300 --> 06:13.600
AND HAS GENEROUSLY
OFFERED ME A POSITION
WITHIN THE FIRM,

06:13.600 --> 06:16.667
SO, AS YOU CAN SEE,
MY FUTURE'S ASSURED.

06:16.667 --> 06:18.967
WHAT KIND OF
BUSINESS IS IT?

06:18.967 --> 06:21.000
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT, YOU KNOW,
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER

06:21.000 --> 06:22.500
BECAUSE THIS WEEKEND
THE MATTHEWS MEN
ARE ATTENDING

06:22.500 --> 06:27.300
THE "BE YOUR OWN BOSS
FRANCHISE EXPOSITION
OPPORTUNITY EXTRAVAGANZA"

06:27.300 --> 06:29.400
AT THE AIRPORT
COMFORT INN.

06:29.400 --> 06:31.734
WHERE DREAMS
ARE BORN.

06:31.734 --> 06:33.200
YEAH.

06:33.200 --> 06:37.967
DAD, SOMEWHERE OUT THERE
LIES OUR BRIGHT,
SHINING FUTURE.

06:37.967 --> 06:40.133
WHERE DO YOU WANT
TO START?

06:40.133 --> 06:41.600
WELL, SINCE I'VE BEEN
IN FOOD MY WHOLE LIFE,

06:41.600 --> 06:47.100
I THINK WE CAN ELIMINATE
EVERYTHING FROM
SPAGHETTI-IN-A-BAG TO...

06:47.100 --> 06:50.600
DAS FALAFEL SERGEANT.

06:50.600 --> 06:53.100
YEAH. WELL,
SINCE I'VE BEEN
IN SCHOOL MY WHOLE LIFE,

06:53.100 --> 06:55.200
I WANT TO ELIMINATE
ANYTHING WHERE YOU
HAVE TO SHOWER WITH GUYS.

06:55.200 --> 06:57.767
GENTLEMEN, I COULDN'T
HELP BUT OVERHEAR
YOUR CAREER CONSTERNATION.

06:57.767 --> 06:59.834
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
IS SOMETHING FRESH,
SOMETHING NEW,

06:59.834 --> 07:04.567
A BUSINESS WITH
UNLIMITED GROWTH OPPORTUNITY
WHERE YOU CAN BE YOUR OWN BOSS.

07:04.567 --> 07:06.300
DOES IT SOUND GOOD
SO FAR?

07:06.300 --> 07:07.600
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

07:07.600 --> 07:08.767
THEN LET ME ASK YOU,
DO YOU HAVE A DOG?

07:08.767 --> 07:09.767
YES.

07:09.767 --> 07:11.133
NO!
NO, WE DON'T.

07:11.133 --> 07:13.300
WE'LL GET ONE.
DON'T BLOW THIS.
WE HAVE A SMALL DOG.

07:13.300 --> 07:16.467
ACCORDING TO THIS GRAPH,
OVER 75 MILLION AMERICANS
HAVE A DOG,

07:16.467 --> 07:21.800
AND EVERY DAY THOSE DOGS
LEAVE BEHIND A GREAT DEAL OF,
SHALL WE SAY, RESIDUE.

07:21.800 --> 07:22.834
I THINK WE'VE
HEARD ENOUGH.

07:22.834 --> 07:24.200
NO! LET'S SEE
WHERE THIS IS GOING.

07:24.200 --> 07:26.767
NOW, LET'S FACE IT.
NO ONE IS PICKING UP
THIS STINKY MESS

07:26.767 --> 07:28.734
ON OUR LAWNS, ON OUR PARKS.
WHAT TO DO?

07:28.734 --> 07:31.300
HERE LIES THE ANSWER.

07:31.300 --> 07:32.734
WHAT IS IT?

07:32.734 --> 07:33.734
POO-POURRI.

07:33.734 --> 07:34.834
POO-POURRI?

07:34.834 --> 07:38.567
POO-POURRI. DEODORIZES,
SANITIZES, GLAMORIZES.

07:38.567 --> 07:40.200
OOH, CAKE!

07:40.200 --> 07:41.200
COME ON,
LET'S GO.

07:41.200 --> 07:42.834
NO. I WANT TO
MAKE THIS MY LIFE.

07:42.834 --> 07:44.300
GENTLEMEN, THE FIGURES
ARE IRREFUTABLE.

07:44.300 --> 07:48.734
IF EACH PET-OWNING AMERICAN
PURCHASES ONLY ONE CAN
OF POO-POURRI,

07:48.734 --> 07:50.600
THIS FRANCHISE IS WORTH
OVER $40 BILLION,

07:50.600 --> 07:54.400
CATAPULTING POO-POURRI INC.
TO THE NUMBER ONE
CORPORATION IN AMERICA.

07:54.400 --> 07:55.667
AND IF NOBODY
BUYS IT?

07:55.667 --> 07:59.800
WELL, NOW YOU SOUND
LIKE MY WIFE!

08:01.367 --> 08:03.200
SO THAT'S A LEADER
SO FAR, HUH, DAD?

08:03.200 --> 08:04.467
UH, SADLY, IT IS, SON,

08:04.467 --> 08:07.233
BUT THERE ARE MANY
BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES
TO CONSIDER,

08:07.233 --> 08:10.734
AND I'M SURE
WE WILL FIND EXACTLY
THE RIGHT THING FOR US.

08:10.734 --> 08:13.200
YOU WANT TO OPEN
AN OGNER'S HOUSE
OF STRUDEL?

08:13.200 --> 08:16.500
I DO, AND HERE'S WHY.
THERE'S 149 VARIETIES,
AND EVERY MONTH

08:16.500 --> 08:20.200
THEY ASSURE ME
THAT FRAU OGNER COMES OUT
WITH A NEW FLAVOR.

08:20.200 --> 08:24.900
SO NOW MY FUTURE DEPENDS
ON A BAVARIAN NAMED OGNER.

08:24.900 --> 08:26.934
SHAWN WARNED ME
ABOUT THIS.

08:26.934 --> 08:30.367
ALAN, TELL ME YOU
ARE NOT BUYING INTO
THIS STRUDEL IDEA.

08:30.367 --> 08:32.900
NO, NO. ACTUALLY,
THIS WAS MY FIRST CHOICE.

08:32.900 --> 08:36.033
RAPIDMART?
WHAT IS THIS,
A CONVENIENCE STORE?

08:36.033 --> 08:38.667
YEAH. I THINK IT
MAKES PERFECT SENSE
FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME.

08:38.667 --> 08:40.600
IT'S A BUSINESS
I ALREADY KNOW.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.100
IT'S A BUSINESS
YOU ALREADY HATE.

08:42.100 --> 08:45.000
I HATED WORKING
FOR SOMEBODY ELSE.
THIS WOULD BE DIFFERENT.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.200
I'D RUN MY OWN STORE,
RUN IT MY WAY.

08:47.200 --> 08:48.300
YOU'RE STILL
SELLING LETTUCE.

08:48.300 --> 08:51.000
ALAN,
YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT
WHAT YOU WANT.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.700
AMY, I CAN'T SEEM
TO WIN WITH YOU.

08:52.700 --> 08:56.367
YOU WANTED TO BE
INCLUDED IN THE DECISION,
SO I INCLUDE YOU,

08:56.367 --> 08:58.500
AND NOW YOU'RE TRYING
TO TALK ME OUT OF

08:58.500 --> 09:00.967
SOMETHING I KIND OF
SORT OF MAYBE WANT TO DO.

09:00.967 --> 09:03.000
OH, WELL, GEE, WITH
THAT KIND OF PASSION,

09:03.000 --> 09:04.500
WHO AM I TO STAND
IN YOUR WAY?

09:04.500 --> 09:07.667
HELLO?!
IS THIS OBVIOUS
ONLY TO ME? STRUDEL.

09:07.667 --> 09:09.000
ERIC, NO STRUDEL.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.400
FINE, YOU'RE OUT.

09:10.400 --> 09:11.500
NAPTIME.

09:11.500 --> 09:12.934
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

09:12.934 --> 09:16.600
LOOK, AMY, I LOOKED
AT EVERY POSSIBLE
JOB OPPORTUNITY,

09:16.600 --> 09:19.200
AND THIS IS WHAT
I WANT TO DO

09:19.200 --> 09:21.300
BECAUSE THIS MAKES
THE MOST SENSE.

09:21.300 --> 09:22.700
THIS ISN'T ABOUT
WHAT MAKES SENSE.

09:22.700 --> 09:24.900
THIS IS ABOUT
SPENDING THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE

09:24.900 --> 09:26.867
DOING WHAT YOU
WANT TO DO.

09:26.867 --> 09:29.500
I WANT TO RUN
MY OWN STORE.

09:29.500 --> 09:31.934
I WANT YOU TO BE
HAPPY FOR ME.

09:31.934 --> 09:35.200
NOW, ARE YOU BEHIND ME
ON THIS OR NOT?

09:35.200 --> 09:36.200
NO.

09:37.300 --> 09:37.934
FINE.

09:37.934 --> 09:40.667
THANK YOU
FOR YOUR SUPPORT.

09:50.700 --> 09:52.100
WHAT IS THAT,
YOUR SLEEPING BAG?

09:52.100 --> 09:53.100
UH-HUH.

09:53.100 --> 09:54.567
OH, ONE LITTLE
DISAGREEMENT,

09:54.567 --> 09:56.767
AND YOU'RE
WALKING OUT ON ME?

09:56.767 --> 09:58.600
AND I'M TAKING ERIC.

09:58.600 --> 10:00.500
COUPLE OF NIGHTS
UNDER THE STARS,

10:00.500 --> 10:03.700
A LITTLE HIKING
THROUGH THE WOODS,
SOME FISHING...

10:03.700 --> 10:06.567
THAT'S WHERE I DO
MY BEST THINKING.

10:06.567 --> 10:08.767
I GOT TO TRY
AND FIGURE OUT

10:08.767 --> 10:12.867
WHAT TO DO WITH
THE REST OF MY LIFE.

10:12.867 --> 10:15.700
ALAN,
WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT
IN THE KITCHEN,

10:15.700 --> 10:17.667
YOU KNOW THAT I WOULD
NEVER STAND IN THE WAY

10:17.667 --> 10:20.400
OF SOMETHING I THOUGHT
YOU REALLY WANTED TO DO.

10:20.400 --> 10:21.567
I KNOW THAT.

10:21.567 --> 10:24.734
BUT THIS ISN'T ABOUT
WHAT I WANT TO DO.

10:24.734 --> 10:28.400
THIS IS ABOUT
MY RESPONSIBILITY
TO THIS FAMILY,

10:28.400 --> 10:30.467
AND I JUST...

10:30.467 --> 10:32.834
I JUST FEEL
SO HELPLESS.

10:32.834 --> 10:35.934
HONEY, YOU FEEL HELPLESS
BECAUSE YOU'RE STUCK.

10:35.934 --> 10:38.734
ALAN, IT'S ALL RIGHT
TO TAKE A RISK.

10:38.734 --> 10:41.834
I CAN'T SUPPORT
THIS CONVENIENCE STORE IDEA

10:41.834 --> 10:44.500
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU WON'T
BE HAPPY,

10:44.500 --> 10:48.467
AND I CAN ONLY SUPPORT
YOUR HAPPINESS.

10:59.400 --> 11:03.600
CORY, TAKING PART
IN A RESEARCH STUDY IS
A RIDICULOUS WAY TO MAKE MONEY.

11:03.600 --> 11:06.467
IF YOU NEED IT THAT BAD,
I'LL LEND IT TO YOU.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
WELL, SHAWN SAYS
I'VE GOT TO LEARN
TO PROVIDE FOR MYSELF.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.233
WELL, THEN GET
A REAL JOB.

11:13.233 --> 11:17.300
WELL, SHAWN SAYS
I'M IN NO POSITION
TO PAY TAXES RIGHT NOW.

11:17.300 --> 11:20.600
THESE GUYS
DON'T EVEN WANT TO
KNOW OUR REAL NAMES.

11:20.600 --> 11:24.100
WELL, I THINK YOU GUYS
ARE BOTH LUNATICS.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.667
YEAH? WELL, WE'LL SEE
WHAT YOU THINK

11:25.667 --> 11:27.233
AFTER WE GET
OUR 100 BUCKS.

11:27.233 --> 11:28.934
JUST FOR TESTING
A NEW SHAMPOO?

11:28.934 --> 11:30.300
YEP.

11:30.300 --> 11:32.467
[WHISPERING]
You sure there's
nothing to worry about?

11:32.467 --> 11:35.100
Worry?
Cory, it's shampoo!

11:35.100 --> 11:36.600
They only
test it on humans

11:36.600 --> 11:39.100
so they can say
they don't test it
on animals.

11:46.934 --> 11:49.000
[ALARM SOUNDING]

11:59.000 --> 12:03.667
HIKING, FISHING,
COOKING OUR OWN FOOD
OVER A FIRE.

12:03.667 --> 12:05.000
I'M TELLING YOU
SOMETHING, DAD,

12:05.000 --> 12:07.600
THAT'S WHAT
WE GOT TO DO WITH
THE REST OF OUR LIVES.

12:07.600 --> 12:10.567
WE GOT TO STAY
OUT THERE,
BECOME MOUNTAIN MEN.

12:10.567 --> 12:13.033
YEAH. WHAT DO YOU
THINK THAT PAYS?

12:13.033 --> 12:14.367
AH, THE INTREPID
WOODSMEN

12:14.367 --> 12:17.700
RETURNING TO
THE SAFE HARBOR
OF SUBURBIA.

12:17.700 --> 12:19.400
DID YOU BAG
ANY TROPHIES?

12:19.400 --> 12:23.100
OOH! BOY,
YOU BET WE DID.
ERIC GOT A FISH.

12:23.100 --> 12:24.200
DAD!

12:24.200 --> 12:27.500
COME ON. SHOW HIM.
COME ON, BOY.

12:32.467 --> 12:33.467
OH, BOY.

12:33.467 --> 12:37.033
I IMAGINE HE PUT UP
A HECK OF A FIGHT.

12:37.033 --> 12:38.233
WELL, NOT REALLY.

12:38.233 --> 12:40.734
I WAS ACTUALLY
JUST FILLING UP
MY TOOTHBRUSH CUP.

12:40.734 --> 12:42.834
HE JUST KIND OF
SWAM RIGHT IN THERE.

12:42.834 --> 12:44.200
HI, GUYS.

12:44.200 --> 12:45.734
HEY, HONEY!

12:45.734 --> 12:49.033
OH, BOY,
YOU SEEM REFRESHED.

12:49.033 --> 12:53.300
DID SLEEPING
UNDER THE STARS
POINT YOU TO A NEW CAREER?

12:53.300 --> 12:54.500
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO

12:54.500 --> 12:55.767
WITH THE REST
OF MY LIFE,

12:55.767 --> 12:57.934
BUT NOTHING
CAN GIVE ME HALF
THE SATISFACTION I GET

12:57.934 --> 13:00.600
WAKING UP NEXT TO
THAT BEAUTIFUL
CEDAR LAKE.

13:00.600 --> 13:01.867
YES, EXHILARATING
FEELING.

13:01.867 --> 13:04.033
SHAME YOU CAN'T
CAPTURE IT SOMEHOW

13:04.033 --> 13:06.600
AND KEEP IT
ON YOUR DESK, HMM?

13:06.600 --> 13:07.834
Alan: YEAH.

13:07.834 --> 13:09.200
YOU KNOW,
THE ONLY THING WRONG
WITH THIS WEEKEND

13:09.200 --> 13:10.500
WAS THAT
YOU WEREN'T THERE.

13:10.500 --> 13:14.467
LET'S GO UP AGAIN,
HUH? NEXT WEEKEND.
YOU COME, TOO.

13:14.467 --> 13:15.600
MIGHT I SUGGEST,

13:15.600 --> 13:18.100
FOR THE SAKE OF
COMMUNAL BLISS,

13:18.100 --> 13:19.300
THAT YOU OUTFIT
YOURSELVES

13:19.300 --> 13:22.233
WITH ONE OF
THOSE 2-PERSON
SLEEPING BAGS

13:22.233 --> 13:25.734
THAT ARE CURRENTLY
ON DISCOUNT
AT KIMBALL'S?

13:25.734 --> 13:27.467
GEORGE, YOU RASCAL!

13:27.467 --> 13:29.600
HOW DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THOSE?

13:29.600 --> 13:33.367
I GO CAMPING.
I DON'T FISH.

13:34.400 --> 13:36.867
YOU DO THE MATH.

13:39.600 --> 13:41.233
ANYWAY,
I WAS DOWN THERE
THIS MORNING

13:41.233 --> 13:43.700
HAVING A TALK
WITH MY OLD FRIEND
ED KIMBALL,

13:43.700 --> 13:45.567
WHO'S HAVING
SOME KIND OF A SALE.

13:45.567 --> 13:46.900
WHY DON'T YOU
POP OVER THERE

13:46.900 --> 13:48.834
AND TELL ED
I SENT YOU?

13:48.834 --> 13:51.100
I KNOW KIMBALL'S.
IT'S ONE OF
MY FAVORITE STORES.

13:51.100 --> 13:55.500
HEY, GUYS. ANY UPDATE
ON OUR CURRENT SITUATION?

13:55.500 --> 13:56.800
ACTUALLY, YES,
THERE IS.

13:56.800 --> 13:58.467
THIS WEEKEND,
WE'RE GOING UP TO
THE MOUNTAINS.

13:58.467 --> 14:00.400
WE'RE GOING TO
SLEEP ON THE GROUND.

14:00.400 --> 14:03.834
OH, WE'VE LOST EVERYTHING.

14:09.800 --> 14:12.667
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
SHAWN! YOU'RE HERE.

14:12.667 --> 14:15.200
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE
DOING YOUR LITTLE
PUPPET SHOW DOWNTOWN

14:15.200 --> 14:16.600
WHICH ALWAYS
BRINGS IN THE CASH.

14:16.600 --> 14:19.200
I SAID,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:19.200 --> 14:20.934
IT'S NOT MINE.
I FOUND IT.

14:20.934 --> 14:23.300
IT'S NOT LIKE
I PAID FOR IT.

14:23.300 --> 14:28.233
I SAID,
<i>WHAT ARE YOU DOING?</i>

14:29.300 --> 14:32.667
I'M EATING MEAT!

14:32.667 --> 14:34.133
YOU DISGUST ME, MAN.

14:34.133 --> 14:35.500
BUT I LIKE MEAT.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.100
IT'S MY PARENTS'
FAULT, SHAWN.

14:37.100 --> 14:40.600
THEY RAISED ME.
THEY GAVE ME
AN ALLOWANCE.

14:40.600 --> 14:43.200
CORY, CORY, CORY.
MY DEAR, SWEET CORY.

14:43.200 --> 14:44.300
THERE'S NO SHAME.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.800
THERE'S
2 TYPES OF PEOPLE
IN THIS WORLD:

14:46.800 --> 14:49.400
PEOPLE LIKE YOU,
WHO ALWAYS MANAGE
TO GET BY

14:49.400 --> 14:50.834
AND PEOPLE LIKE ME

14:50.834 --> 14:54.367
THAT ARE LUCKY ENOUGH
TO HAVE PEOPLE LIKE YOU
IN THEIR LIVES.

14:54.367 --> 14:57.200
THANKS, MAN.
YOU WANT HALF?

14:57.200 --> 14:59.800
IT'S HOW THE POOR
SURVIVE.

15:02.900 --> 15:07.900
DAD, THIS FISHING ROD
IS NOTHING LIKE
<i>OUR </i>FISHING ROD.

15:08.500 --> 15:09.600
WELL, THAT'S
A MacMILLAN.

15:09.600 --> 15:12.800
GRAPHITE 4,000 SERIES.
TOP-OF-THE-LINE, MY BOY.

15:12.800 --> 15:14.100
NOW, PUT IT DOWN, GENTLY.

15:14.100 --> 15:15.934
I SEE
YOU KNOW YOUR
FISHING GEAR.

15:15.934 --> 15:19.667
UH, YES. ALAN MATTHEWS.
I'M A FRIEND
OF GEORGE FEENY'S.

15:19.667 --> 15:22.300
GEORGE. YEAH, SURE.
I SURE ENJOY
OUR LITTLE CHATS.

15:22.300 --> 15:25.300
I JUST WISH
HE'D BUY SOMETHING
ONCE IN A WHILE.

15:25.300 --> 15:26.934
HEY, DAD,
LOOK AT THESE KAYAKS.

15:26.934 --> 15:28.767
HOW COOL WOULD THAT BE
ON THE LAKE?

15:28.767 --> 15:31.400
NOT NEARLY AS COOL AS THIS TENT.
CHECK THIS OUT.

15:31.400 --> 15:34.367
"SURVIVAL-RATED FOR WINDS
UP TO 100 MILES PER HOUR."

15:34.367 --> 15:35.600
I'M NOT GOING.

15:35.600 --> 15:39.100
HEY, DO YOU KNOW
THEY BROUGHT A TENT
JUST LIKE THIS

15:39.100 --> 15:40.834
UP TO THE TOP
OF MOUNT EVEREST?

15:40.834 --> 15:44.100
I'M SURE YOU COULD
SURVIVE A FEW NIGHTS
ON CEDAR LAKE.

15:44.100 --> 15:46.467
BOY, YOU GOT
ALL THE BEST TOYS HERE.

15:46.467 --> 15:49.400
LET ME SHOW YOU
THE NEW CATALOG
AND SEE WHAT'S COMING.

15:49.400 --> 15:53.500
THANK YOU FOR
INDULGING MY HUSBAND.
HE REALLY LOVES YOUR STORE.

15:53.500 --> 15:56.867
OH, I CAN SEE THAT,
AND IT LOOKS LIKE
YOUR KIDS DO, TOO.

15:56.867 --> 16:00.500
HEY, I CAN SEE
MEN'S SPORTSWEAR FROM HERE!

16:00.500 --> 16:02.100
IT'S REALLY
A WONDERFUL STORE.

16:02.100 --> 16:03.700
HOW LONG
HAVE YOU HAD IT?

16:03.700 --> 16:06.767
OH, MY GOSH.
BEEN IN THE FAMILY
ABOUT 47 YEARS.

16:06.767 --> 16:08.400
I WAS GOING TO
LEAVE IT TO MY SON,

16:08.400 --> 16:09.767
ONLY I HAD
A DAUGHTER,

16:09.767 --> 16:12.967
AND SHE MARRIED
AN ORTHODONTIST AND
MOVED TO PALM BEACH.

16:12.967 --> 16:14.500
SO, WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO?

16:14.500 --> 16:15.734
I'VE GOT IT
UP FOR SALE.

16:15.734 --> 16:16.767
I WANT TO SPEND
SOME TIME

16:16.767 --> 16:18.300
WITH
MY GRANDCHILDREN
IN THE SOUTH.

16:18.300 --> 16:19.700
YOU KNOW, I WAS
JUST MENTIONING THIS

16:19.700 --> 16:21.500
TO GEORGE FEENY
THE OTHER DAY.

16:21.500 --> 16:26.500
FEENY. HE MENTIONED
YOU WERE HAVING A SALE.

16:28.500 --> 16:30.767
MR. KIMBALL, I KNOW
IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS,

16:30.767 --> 16:33.667
BUT DID YOU
MAKE A GOOD LIVING
FROM THIS PLACE?

16:33.667 --> 16:35.233
OH, WELL, SOME YEARS
ARE BETTER
THAN OTHERS,

16:35.233 --> 16:37.900
BUT LET ME
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

16:37.900 --> 16:39.834
IF LOOKING FORWARD
TO COMING TO WORK EVERY DAY

16:39.834 --> 16:41.867
WAS ANY INDICATION,
THEN I'VE DONE VERY WELL.

16:41.867 --> 16:44.100
I SUPPOSE YOU GOT
ALL YOUR BUYERS
LINED UP, HUH?

16:44.100 --> 16:45.400
A FEW NIBBLES,

16:45.400 --> 16:47.667
BUT YOU KNOW,
THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN
A FAMILY BUSINESS.

16:47.667 --> 16:49.400
I WANT TO KEEP IT
A FAMILY BUSINESS,

16:49.400 --> 16:51.500
EVEN IF IT'S NOT
<i>MY </i>FAMILY ANYMORE.

16:51.500 --> 16:53.200
ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE AGREED.
THIS IS THE ONE.

16:53.200 --> 16:56.400
YEP. ABSOLUTELY.
I MEAN, THIS IS OBVIOUSLY
THE BEST ONE THAT THEY'VE GOT.

16:56.400 --> 16:58.200
OH, PLEASE. THIS ONE
IS CLEARLY BETTER.

16:58.200 --> 17:00.967
I MEAN, IT'S GOT MORE
INTERIOR WATTAGE
AND LUMINOSITY.

17:00.967 --> 17:01.967
THEY'RE EXACTLY
THE SAME.

17:01.967 --> 17:04.734
WHICH IS WHY I PLAN
TO BE AN ACCOUNTANT.

17:04.734 --> 17:05.734
COME ON.

17:05.734 --> 17:07.867
WELL, AMY, WE BETTER
GET OUT OF HERE

17:07.867 --> 17:10.233
BEFORE WE BUY UP
THE WHOLE STORE.

17:10.233 --> 17:11.600
I ALREADY DID.

17:11.600 --> 17:14.000
LOOKS LIKE MY WHOLE FAMILY
LIKES YOUR STORE.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.767
IT'S NOT
MY STORE ANYMORE.

17:15.767 --> 17:16.800
WHAT?

17:16.800 --> 17:18.934
YOUR WIFE
JUST BOUGHT IT.

17:18.934 --> 17:20.000
WHAT?

17:20.000 --> 17:22.033
WELL,
THE MAN'S STORE
WAS UP FOR SALE,

17:22.033 --> 17:24.400
SO I BOUGHT IT.

17:26.033 --> 17:28.000
YOU CAN'T
JUST DO THAT.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
CAN SHE DO THAT?

17:29.000 --> 17:30.300
SHE JUST DID.

17:30.300 --> 17:33.600
HEY, LISTEN.
I'M A REASONABLE MAN.
WE CAME TO TERMS.

17:33.600 --> 17:37.233
AMY...LOOK, I UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO,

17:37.233 --> 17:39.667
BUT YOU JUST CAN'T
WALK INTO--

17:39.667 --> 17:40.667
I CAN'T WHAT?

17:40.667 --> 17:43.367
YOU OWE ME
A BIG DECISION,
BUDDY,

17:43.367 --> 17:45.667
ONE THAT AFFECTS
THIS WHOLE FAMILY.

17:45.667 --> 17:48.200
WELL, YOU'RE
STANDING IN IT.

17:51.467 --> 17:56.033
SO, UH, THIS IS ALL
<i>MY </i>BEEF JERKY?

17:56.033 --> 17:57.400
HEY, DAD,
HOW GREAT IS THIS?

17:57.400 --> 17:59.000
I'M GOING TO BE
WORKING FOR YOU.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.800
I'M GLAD YOU FEEL
THAT WAY, ERIC,

18:00.800 --> 18:04.500
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO TAP INTO
YOUR COLLEGE FUND

18:04.500 --> 18:05.800
FOR THE DOWN PAYMENT.

18:05.800 --> 18:07.133
HEY, DAD,
HOW GREAT IS THIS?

18:07.133 --> 18:08.934
YOU'RE GOING TO BE
WORKING FOR ME.

18:08.934 --> 18:11.200
HOW ABOUT
IF YOU'RE PARTNERS?

18:11.200 --> 18:12.900
THAT'S EVEN GREATER!

18:12.900 --> 18:15.200
AMY, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THIS.

18:15.200 --> 18:16.400
WHAT'S NOT TO KNOW?

18:16.400 --> 18:19.934
WHAT? ARE YOU AFRAID
YOU'RE GOING TO
BE HAPPY?

18:21.000 --> 18:22.300
IT'S OK?

18:22.300 --> 18:25.800
I MEAN,
IT'S OK TO DO THIS?

18:25.800 --> 18:29.600
ALAN, WE GIVE YOU
PERMISSION
TO TAKE A RISK.

18:29.600 --> 18:30.700
NOW,
YOU LOOK AROUND,

18:30.700 --> 18:32.400
AND IF YOU
CAN TELL ME
FROM YOUR HEART

18:32.400 --> 18:34.500
THAT NONE OF THIS
IS GOING TO
MAKE YOU HAPPY,

18:34.500 --> 18:36.033
THEN WE WILL
WALK OUT THAT DOOR,

18:36.033 --> 18:38.233
AND WE WILL DISCUSS
SOMETHING ELSE.

18:40.200 --> 18:41.734
Alan: UH...

18:41.734 --> 18:43.000
UH, NO. NO.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.567
I BELIEVE
THE DEAL WAS

18:44.567 --> 18:49.367
THAT I DON'T
GET TO DISCUSS
YOUR DECISION, RIGHT?

18:50.400 --> 18:51.934
RIGHT.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.400
THANK YOU.

18:57.500 --> 19:00.767
WELL, YOU...
HEARD THE LADY.
WRAP IT UP.

19:00.767 --> 19:01.967
[LAUGHTER]

19:01.967 --> 19:03.467
YEAH!

19:09.734 --> 19:11.200
NOW, THESE ARE
ACCOUNTS PAYABLE,

19:11.200 --> 19:12.800
THESE ARE ACCOUNTS
RECEIVABLE.

19:12.800 --> 19:14.000
IT'S ALL PRETTY
STRAIGHTFORWARD.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.100
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
ANY PROBLEM.

19:15.100 --> 19:18.200
UH, YEAH,
I CAN HANDLE THAT.

19:18.200 --> 19:19.667
WE'LL HIRE SOMEONE.

19:19.667 --> 19:21.967
WOULD YOU?

19:21.967 --> 19:23.100
HELLO, GEORGE.

19:23.100 --> 19:28.100
HEY, GEORGE!
WELCOME TO<i>OUR </i>NEW SHOP.

19:28.600 --> 19:29.667
REALLY?

19:29.667 --> 19:30.667
MM-HMM.

19:30.667 --> 19:31.767
AH, CONGRATULATIONS,
ALAN.

19:31.767 --> 19:33.300
DO YOU MIND
IF I BROWSE A BIT?

19:33.300 --> 19:37.200
NO. OF COURSE.
PICK SOMETHING OUT.
YOU'LL BE OUR FIRST SALE.

19:37.200 --> 19:39.400
NOT LIKELY.

19:39.400 --> 19:43.467
$18 FOR SOCKS?
COME ON, MAN.

19:43.467 --> 19:45.233
THEY ARE THERMAL,
THEY ARE DOUBLE-LAYERED,

19:45.233 --> 19:47.233
AND THEY ARE FULLY
MOISTUREPROOF.

19:47.233 --> 19:49.100
THEY'RE $18,
AND THEY'RE SOCKS.

19:49.100 --> 19:51.767
I'M A TEACHER,
NOT A HEART SURGEON.

19:51.767 --> 19:55.100
HEY, MR. FEENY, WHY DON'T I
SHOW YOU SOME SNOWSHOES?

19:55.100 --> 19:57.734
NOW, WHY WOULD I
BE INTERESTED
IN SNOWSHOES?

19:57.734 --> 19:59.500
[WHISPERING]
There are no snowshoes!

19:59.500 --> 20:00.967
I'M AN IDIOT.

20:00.967 --> 20:03.600
I MEAN,
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT NUMBERS AND ACCOUNTS.

20:03.600 --> 20:05.367
I'M GOING TO BRING
THIS WHOLE STORE
CRASHING DOWN.

20:05.367 --> 20:08.100
WE'RE GOING TO END UP
LIVING IN A BOX
IN THE PARK.

20:08.100 --> 20:10.367
WELL, THERE ARE SOME
SOCKS OVER THERE

20:10.367 --> 20:12.033
THAT WOULD KEEP YOU
QUITE WARM.

20:12.033 --> 20:13.600
MR. FEENY, WOULD YOU
TUTOR ME, PLEASE?

20:13.600 --> 20:15.767
I GOT TO LEARN HOW
TO RUN A BUSINESS HERE.

20:15.767 --> 20:17.500
ERIC,
YOU NEED A COMPLETE
EDUCATION,

20:17.500 --> 20:20.934
AND THAT'S MORE
THAN LEARNING HOW
TO DO THE BOOKS.

20:20.934 --> 20:23.567
YOU WANT ME TO GO
TO COLLEGE, DON'T YOU?

20:23.567 --> 20:24.667
I WANT YOU
TO REALIZE

20:24.667 --> 20:26.967
THAT AT
ANY GIVEN TIME
IN YOUR LIFE,

20:26.967 --> 20:28.800
YOU'LL BE EXPECTED
TO KNOW SOMETHING.

20:28.800 --> 20:30.133
NOW, TODAY IT WAS
ACCOUNTANCY.

20:30.133 --> 20:32.467
WHO KNOWS WHAT
IT WILL BE TOMORROW?

20:32.467 --> 20:34.000
I WANT YOU
TO BE PREPARED.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.100
WILL YOU PREPARE ME?

20:35.100 --> 20:37.233
ALL RIGHT,
MEET ME AT SCHOOL,

20:37.233 --> 20:38.967
AND WE'LL WORK OUT
A SCHEDULE.

20:38.967 --> 20:41.233
OH, THANK YOU,
MR. FEENY.

20:41.233 --> 20:43.934
I THINK I<i>WILL </i>BUY
THAT PAIR OF SOCKS.

20:43.934 --> 20:48.500
OH, SURE.
WAIT TILL I SELL THE STORE,
THEN YOU BUY SOMETHING.

20:49.567 --> 20:52.667
HERE IT IS, DAD:
OUR FIRST SALE.

20:52.667 --> 20:54.300
HEY! ALL RIGHT!
