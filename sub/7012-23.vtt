WEBVTT

00:02.940 --> 00:05.580
Any good mail?

00:06.740 --> 00:08.900
Well, we got the new
Yarn Barn catalog.

00:08.980 --> 00:11.340
And the model is
showing cleavage?

00:13.020 --> 00:17.540
You know, if I want that in my house,
I will watch <i>McMillan and Wife.</i>

00:17.580 --> 00:20.300
Oh, Steven got a letter
from Department of Motor Vehicles.

00:20.380 --> 00:23.700
What?
Another damn ticket?

00:25.900 --> 00:28.500
Hey, screw-head!

00:28.580 --> 00:30.860
Why is the D.M.V.
sending you letters?

00:30.900 --> 00:34.540
Screw-head. Hey, screw-head.

00:34.620 --> 00:37.220
No, no, no.
You're screw-head.

00:37.260 --> 00:40.060
I'm just called "boy."

00:40.140 --> 00:42.220
I got a letter
from the D.M.V.?

00:42.300 --> 00:44.740
Oh, my God.
It's about the cow.

00:48.580 --> 00:50.420
Did I say "cow"?

00:50.500 --> 00:54.140
Because what I meant
was <i>countdown...</i>

00:56.780 --> 00:59.180
countdown to better driving.

01:03.940 --> 01:07.060
I think what Eric's trying
to say is, he hit a cow.

01:07.140 --> 01:09.740
Wait...

01:09.820 --> 01:12.100
Well, I had
the right-of-way!

01:13.140 --> 01:16.100
Go ahead.
Open it, hot rod.

01:16.140 --> 01:18.940
You know, you are
the most irresponsible...

01:19.020 --> 01:21.820
careless, no-account, undisc...

01:21.900 --> 01:24.140
Oh, it's a license renewal
for my 18th birthday.

01:26.180 --> 01:28.100
Oh.

01:29.260 --> 01:31.420
Happy birthday!

01:38.880 --> 01:43.400
Guess who gets 18 hugs the day
before his 18th birthday?

01:43.480 --> 01:45.640
One, two...
Everyone!

01:45.720 --> 01:47.560
- Three, four, five...
- Okay.

01:47.640 --> 01:50.200
- Six, seven, eight...
- Okay. All right, all right!

01:50.280 --> 01:53.040
Thanks, Mrs. Forman,
but you can drop it.

01:53.120 --> 01:55.320
I'm not really into birthdays,
especially this one.

01:55.400 --> 01:59.040
- Oh, no, you don't! Nine, ten...
- Get off me, spaz!

02:04.720 --> 02:06.880
Oh, Steven likes birthdays.
He just doesn't know it.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.680
Which is why we're throwing him
a surprise party.

02:09.759 --> 02:14.600
Now, I need two helpers with keen
feminine sensibilities to help decorate.

02:14.680 --> 02:16.520
Jackie and Fez.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:25.120 --> 02:27.040
Yea.

02:29.080 --> 02:32.160
What the hell?
I'm feminine.

02:32.240 --> 02:34.680
I should kick her ass
for that.

02:34.760 --> 02:39.240
Hey, Jackie, while you're up
there, try not to kiss any more guys!

02:41.600 --> 02:43.960
Man, are you guys
still fighting about that?

02:44.000 --> 02:45.920
You gotta come down hard
on stuff like this.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.920
If she'd have come down harder on me
when I was cheating, I would've...

02:50.000 --> 02:53.280
Well, I would have been
way sneakier about it.

02:55.480 --> 02:59.320
You know what, you guys?
Eighteen is a big deal.

02:59.360 --> 03:04.280
We ought to get Hyde,
like, the perfect Hyde gift.

03:04.320 --> 03:08.880
So, you know what? Let's try to put
ourselves in a total Hyde state of mind.

03:08.960 --> 03:11.160
Yeah.

03:13.240 --> 03:15.760
Okay, now, what
would Hyde want?

03:15.840 --> 03:18.640
Something... stolen.

03:20.160 --> 03:23.520
Stolen's good.
But you know what's better?

03:23.600 --> 03:26.440
Stolen and dirty!

03:26.520 --> 03:30.160
So what's a good gift
for Hyde that's stolen and dirty?

03:32.640 --> 03:34.920
Someone else's pig!

03:36.120 --> 03:39.080
No, no, wait!
I got it! I got it!

03:39.160 --> 03:41.000
A street sign.

03:41.080 --> 03:43.800
We'll steal it,
so it'll be stolen...

03:43.840 --> 03:47.440
and it's dirty,
so it'll be dirty.

03:48.760 --> 03:50.720
Oh, my God.

03:50.800 --> 03:54.360
Kelso just solved
his first word problem. Ohh!

03:55.520 --> 03:58.360
Yeah, I learned those
in Miss Carter's class...

03:58.400 --> 04:01.200
'cause I knew if I got one right
that'd she'd give me a hug.

04:01.280 --> 04:04.480
No bra and they
were <i>always</i> pointy.

04:06.080 --> 04:08.280
Now, that's good teachin'.

04:09.600 --> 04:11.480
No problem.
You can have Hyde's party here.

04:11.520 --> 04:13.720
There's only one thing I ask.

04:13.760 --> 04:15.840
Can I come?

04:15.920 --> 04:19.959
The party's at your house, Bob.
Of course you're invited.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.840
Oh, boy, I'm in!

04:22.880 --> 04:25.080
I'll get my
Anne Murray albums!

04:26.720 --> 04:28.600
Okay, now, you two.

04:28.640 --> 04:32.080
I want this party to look nice.
So, um, balloons, streamers...

04:32.160 --> 04:34.520
whatever makes Steven forget
he has no parents.

04:37.120 --> 04:39.960
So, Fez, how do you want
to decorate this place?

04:40.000 --> 04:43.680
- Well, what I'm thinking...
- No, no, no. I want <i>Arabian Nights...</i>

04:43.760 --> 04:45.600
veils, Persian rugs.

04:45.680 --> 04:47.520
Uh-huh.
One question, Jackie.

04:47.600 --> 04:50.560
Is this a party for Hyde,
or a bunch of whores in a whorehouse?

04:58.720 --> 05:01.400
Oh, yeah. Check it out!
"High Street."

05:01.480 --> 05:03.640
Oh, man.
Hyde's gonna love this.

05:03.680 --> 05:06.040
- Here, Donna, I'll give you a boost.
- Okay.

05:06.080 --> 05:08.120
One, two, three.

05:08.160 --> 05:10.760
Oh, yeah!

05:10.840 --> 05:12.760
Fingers!

05:14.040 --> 05:16.560
- Oh!
- Come on, Eric. I'll give you a boost.

05:16.640 --> 05:18.480
No way.

05:18.560 --> 05:20.440
Why not?

05:20.520 --> 05:22.720
Because you'll throw me.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.840
What? No, I won't!

05:24.920 --> 05:27.160
Yeah, I will.

05:27.200 --> 05:30.840
Look. How about we stand on top
of the van and reach it?

05:30.880 --> 05:34.320
I think not!
We'll dent the roof.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.640
I don't want nothin'
to happen to the "love bus."

05:36.720 --> 05:39.160
Okay, I got it.
I got a better idea.

05:40.640 --> 05:43.880
Okay, just make sure
it's tight.

05:43.960 --> 05:47.320
Right. Okay,
you're good to go.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.280
Well, at least
the roof's okay.

06:07.160 --> 06:09.000
Steven!

06:09.080 --> 06:11.560
I thought you were at work.

06:11.640 --> 06:13.640
Not till later.

06:13.720 --> 06:16.240
Why are you baking
so many cupcakes?

06:18.120 --> 06:21.240
I had four dozen eggs.
They were gonna go bad.

06:24.480 --> 06:28.520
Mrs. Forman, I don't want a party.

06:28.600 --> 06:31.560
And I'm not saying that
because I'm fishing for a party.

06:31.640 --> 06:34.880
I mean,
I don't want a party.

06:34.960 --> 06:39.160
- Uh-huh.
- 'Cause I know how this family works.

06:39.200 --> 06:41.680
You guys say you don't want stuff
that you actually want.

06:41.760 --> 06:44.280
Like on Mother's Day.
You said you didn't want a fuss.

06:44.320 --> 06:48.400
But you did want a fuss.
So we made a fuss, and you were happy?

06:48.480 --> 06:50.480
That can drive a guy nuts.

06:50.560 --> 06:52.760
It really can.

06:54.240 --> 06:56.760
So now, I don't know
what to do...

06:56.800 --> 06:59.880
or say or not say...

06:59.960 --> 07:02.760
because I really
don't want a party.

07:02.840 --> 07:07.080
Well, I don't wanna
do anything you don't want.

07:11.640 --> 07:14.120
See, I don't know
what that means!

07:15.280 --> 07:18.320
Well, it means
there's no party.

07:18.400 --> 07:21.240
Oh, please. Would I lie to you
about making you a party?

07:21.280 --> 07:23.320
I am hurt.

07:25.280 --> 07:27.480
Fine.

07:27.560 --> 07:30.160
Okay. I'm sorry.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
- You lied.
- No, no.

07:39.080 --> 07:41.840
I said, "Would I lie?"

07:44.320 --> 07:47.800
It was very tricky.
I was like Houdini, but with words.

07:52.400 --> 07:54.240
The base of the sign's
all cracked.

07:54.320 --> 07:57.880
So all we have to do is shove this
firecracker in there, and blammo!

07:57.920 --> 07:59.960
The sign comes down.

08:01.480 --> 08:03.760
Wow, it could actually work...

08:03.840 --> 08:06.680
if the base were
made of pudding!

08:08.160 --> 08:10.920
If the base were made
of pudding, Eric...

08:11.000 --> 08:13.560
we could just
pull the sign right out.

08:17.440 --> 08:20.840
Okay, get ready to run!

08:31.800 --> 08:33.640
Huh.

08:33.720 --> 08:35.760
Must be a dud.

08:35.840 --> 08:37.720
Go find out.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.760
- Why me?
- 'Cause you're super skinny.

08:41.840 --> 08:45.880
If it blows up, you got the best chance
of having stuff not hit you.

08:45.960 --> 08:48.400
True, but on
the other hand...

08:48.480 --> 08:52.720
no one would be surprised
if you blew yourself up.

08:52.800 --> 08:55.000
That's a good point.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.160
Oh, just move.

09:01.360 --> 09:03.200
Here, you big babies.

09:05.240 --> 09:08.000
Okay, what you just did,
just there?

09:08.040 --> 09:10.200
That was so hot.

09:10.280 --> 09:14.240
I'd follow your fine behind
into combat any day.

09:14.320 --> 09:19.160
All right, look. If we got Red's
tools, I bet I could cut down that pole.

09:19.240 --> 09:21.640
Casey showed me how
to saw through rebar.

09:21.720 --> 09:23.880
Our second date.

09:23.960 --> 09:26.400
Wow. I love those stories.

09:26.480 --> 09:30.720
Hey, I'll just sneak into your garage,
grab the tools. Red'll never know.

09:30.760 --> 09:33.400
Okay, but you gotta
be really quiet.

09:33.440 --> 09:36.480
Come on. It's me we're talking about.
I'm like a cat.

09:56.220 --> 09:58.420
Red.

09:58.500 --> 10:01.060
Hey.

10:01.140 --> 10:03.700
You're wonderin' why I'm goin'
through your stuff.

10:05.500 --> 10:07.460
Okay. That's...

10:07.540 --> 10:12.780
See, I needed,
uh, to borrow...

10:12.860 --> 10:15.580
your saw...

10:15.660 --> 10:19.180
because I need
to chop down a tree.

10:22.300 --> 10:25.820
Because there's something
stuck in it.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.900
An animal. A rabbit.

10:33.540 --> 10:37.100
There's a rabbit
stuck in a tree.

10:37.180 --> 10:41.500
And I want to return
that rabbit to the wild...

10:41.580 --> 10:44.180
so it can lay its eggs.

10:51.860 --> 10:53.700
Kelso, rabbits don't...

10:55.460 --> 10:58.540
How the hell did
a rabbit get up a tree?

10:58.620 --> 11:01.860
Uh, Eric threw it
up there.

11:09.900 --> 11:13.500
Eric threw a rabbit
up a tree?

11:14.820 --> 11:19.140
Yeah.
He's a sadistic bastard.

11:21.620 --> 11:24.100
You know he hit a cow?

11:30.620 --> 11:34.140
You know, you've been in
a bad mood all night, man.

11:34.220 --> 11:37.260
I'm gonna cheer you up.

11:37.340 --> 11:39.180
Ah, boo!

11:40.140 --> 11:42.140
Ah, boo!

11:45.140 --> 11:47.700
Aw, you don't know
what's funny.

11:49.220 --> 11:52.140
Oh, hey, uh, I can work
tomorrow night if you want me to.

11:52.220 --> 11:54.380
You're not working tomorrow, man.
It's your birthday.

11:54.460 --> 11:58.300
Yeah, man, my 18th birthday.
Otherwise known as the beginning of the end.

11:58.380 --> 12:02.180
The black hole, man.
It's the death march.

12:02.260 --> 12:04.660
Look, if there's a war,
I could get drafted.

12:04.740 --> 12:08.860
If there's a war, I'll see you in Canada.

12:11.180 --> 12:14.620
That's not the point, Leo.
I mean, there's other stuff too, you know.

12:14.660 --> 12:16.900
Hey, don't get snippy
with me, man.

12:19.380 --> 12:21.860
Hyde, we need you
to settle an argument.

12:21.940 --> 12:24.340
I'm sure you know by now that
we're throwing you a party.

12:24.420 --> 12:26.780
What party?

12:26.820 --> 12:30.580
Okay, I'm sure
you know by <i>now...</i>

12:30.660 --> 12:32.540
that we're throwing
you a party.

12:32.620 --> 12:35.140
So, what kind of theme
would you like?

12:35.220 --> 12:37.820
Throw whatever party you want, man.
I'm not gonna be there.

12:40.940 --> 12:44.260
Well, if that's his attitude,
I don't wanna do anything. I quit.

12:46.260 --> 12:48.220
You can't quit on me.

12:48.300 --> 12:50.980
I quit on you...

12:51.060 --> 12:53.100
you bossy little midget.

12:57.620 --> 12:59.860
Don't even.

13:04.900 --> 13:09.060
- What the hell?
- No! No!

13:10.100 --> 13:12.780
Excuse me,
little boy with glasses.

13:12.860 --> 13:14.700
That's our sign.

13:14.780 --> 13:19.060
Um, excuse me,
big dork with Farrah hair.

13:19.140 --> 13:21.140
No, it isn't.

13:21.220 --> 13:23.100
"Farrah hair"?

13:24.660 --> 13:29.180
If I look like any of the Charlie's Angels,
it's Jaclyn Smith!

13:32.260 --> 13:34.140
Wow, that's true.

13:35.660 --> 13:39.300
Hey, there, little fella.

13:39.380 --> 13:41.220
What if I told you
that I had $20...

13:41.300 --> 13:44.420
for a special someone
if they gave us the sign?

13:44.500 --> 13:46.620
- Nope.
- A month's supply of candy?

13:46.660 --> 13:48.940
- Nope.
- What if...

13:49.020 --> 13:51.180
I show you my bra strap?

13:52.140 --> 13:54.100
Okay.

13:55.300 --> 13:57.940
Okay!

14:01.700 --> 14:03.500
Here.

14:07.060 --> 14:11.300
I bet if I showed him my whole bra,
he would have given me his bike.

14:11.380 --> 14:13.220
These things are awesome.

14:18.540 --> 14:20.460
That was hot.

14:22.180 --> 14:25.100
Man, why is she
so hot today?

14:25.180 --> 14:28.420
'Cause you can't have her,
'cause you lost her, 'cause you're stupid.

14:30.380 --> 14:34.500
Wait. Um, Jackie cheated on you,
right, with a little, tiny cheese guy?

14:34.580 --> 14:37.500
Hey! Truce, okay?

14:37.580 --> 14:40.020
- Yeah, I think that's best.
- Yeah.

14:41.540 --> 14:44.420
Hey, if you hadn't
blown it with Donna...

14:44.460 --> 14:47.180
- you'd probably be doin' it with her right now.
- <i>Yeah!</i>

14:47.260 --> 14:50.300
You know who's probably doin' it?
Jackie, with the cheese guy.

14:53.260 --> 14:55.500
We had a truce!

15:00.300 --> 15:02.180
Wow.

15:02.220 --> 15:05.180
Yeah, this place looks great.

15:05.220 --> 15:08.460
Fez, Jackie,
the decorations are beautiful.

15:08.540 --> 15:10.380
No. No, no, no, no.

15:10.460 --> 15:12.340
They haven't
been here all day.

15:12.420 --> 15:15.900
I did this because
I'm feminine too.

15:15.940 --> 15:19.540
I'm a lady.
Why can't anyone freakin' see that?

15:19.620 --> 15:22.740
Oh, honey, no.
It's perfect.

15:22.820 --> 15:27.140
Okay, the next time I need a feminine touch,
I am using you and Fez.

15:30.700 --> 15:33.020
What happened
to those cupcakes?

15:37.540 --> 15:40.100
Bob, there were
a dozen cupcakes there.

15:40.180 --> 15:43.740
I'm sorry, Red.
They're like vitamins to me.

15:44.780 --> 15:47.340
Hey, you guys.
Bad news.

15:47.420 --> 15:51.100
Hyde said he's not coming.
He's just sitting in the basement.

15:51.180 --> 15:55.020
Oh, but it's his birthday.
He can't be alone on his birthday.

15:56.220 --> 15:58.100
Red?

15:59.460 --> 16:04.020
I agree. Eric, you go home
and sit with Steven.

16:04.100 --> 16:07.180
Oh, okay, fine.
I'll go get him.

16:08.740 --> 16:10.780
Surprise!

16:10.820 --> 16:13.820
We got him, dudes.

16:17.420 --> 16:21.020
All right. Get your butt up
those stairs and over to your party.

16:21.100 --> 16:23.740
I'm not goin'.

16:26.060 --> 16:29.860
Steven, you're 18 now.
It's time to start being a man.

16:29.900 --> 16:32.660
And the first rule
to being a man is...

16:32.740 --> 16:36.700
you gotta spend your life
doing crap you don't wanna do.

16:36.780 --> 16:40.140
Like right now,
I don't wanna be here talkin' to you...

16:40.220 --> 16:42.100
but I am.

16:42.180 --> 16:44.220
And you don't wanna
go to a party...

16:44.300 --> 16:46.460
but you will.

16:46.540 --> 16:48.740
Actually, I won't.

16:48.820 --> 16:50.900
What's the matter?

16:52.020 --> 16:53.940
You don't like parties?

16:54.020 --> 16:56.220
<i>Me neither.</i>

16:56.300 --> 16:58.460
But as long as
you're livin' under my roof...

16:58.540 --> 17:00.420
you'll do what
I tell you to do.

17:00.500 --> 17:05.020
Well, lucky for me, I won't be
under your roof much longer anyway.

17:05.099 --> 17:07.260
What the hell
you talkin' about?

17:07.300 --> 17:10.859
Well, I'm 18.
I should be getting out of here, right?

17:10.940 --> 17:14.740
I mean, that's what my dad did
and my uncle did and my cousins did.

17:14.819 --> 17:16.859
They were all on their own
when they were my age.

17:16.940 --> 17:19.220
What are they doin' now?

17:20.900 --> 17:25.060
Uh, pumping gas, prison,
prison, dead, prison.

17:26.180 --> 17:29.340
And the reason
you're living here...

17:29.380 --> 17:31.900
is so you don't
end up like them.

17:33.540 --> 17:36.420
But if you want to leave,
I can't stop you.

17:36.500 --> 17:39.660
So, what's it gonna be, Steven?

17:39.740 --> 17:43.140
Prison, death
or a birthday party?

17:45.140 --> 17:47.100
I guess
I'll go to the party.

17:49.100 --> 17:51.940
Thanks, Red.

17:53.660 --> 17:56.700
You're welcome.
And, uh...

17:56.780 --> 18:00.340
don't tell Eric that we had
this little conversation.

18:01.860 --> 18:04.100
'Cause when he's 18,
he's out.

18:10.220 --> 18:13.700
So, punch.

18:15.620 --> 18:17.500
Yep.

18:23.300 --> 18:25.340
Oh, fine.

18:27.300 --> 18:31.020
Everybody, they're here!
They're... Shh! Shh!

18:33.220 --> 18:35.300
Surprise!

18:35.380 --> 18:37.220
You got me, dudes.

18:39.140 --> 18:41.020
Wow, thanks.

18:41.060 --> 18:43.500
Oh, happy birthday.

18:43.580 --> 18:47.540
Damn, Jackie!
Stop kissing other guys!

18:52.380 --> 18:55.500
Wow, this is great.
Did you get this at the flea market?

18:55.580 --> 18:59.860
- The flea market?
- Yeah, they sell 'em there for two bucks.

18:59.940 --> 19:03.740
No, we stole it.
It took forever.

19:03.820 --> 19:06.660
I had to show my bra!

19:07.900 --> 19:10.260
You owe me a bumper!

19:12.260 --> 19:15.500
Now, I made this
for you. See?

19:18.380 --> 19:20.300
It says "Steven"
on the front...

19:20.380 --> 19:24.740
because I heard that having your name
on your clothes is cool.

19:24.820 --> 19:28.660
Plus, if anybody finds it,
they can return it to you.

19:30.020 --> 19:33.340
So, I won't be able
to lose it.

19:33.380 --> 19:35.780
Great.

19:42.300 --> 19:44.180
Put it on.

19:45.980 --> 19:47.820
Do I have to?

19:47.900 --> 19:50.260
You bet your ass.

20:03.500 --> 20:05.500
Welcome to manhood.

20:12.540 --> 20:15.340
Mrs. Forman...

20:15.420 --> 20:18.700
I'm not really
a piñata kind of guy.

20:18.780 --> 20:22.900
Oh, come on, Steven.
Everyone plays piñata.

20:25.300 --> 20:29.700
Yeah, Steven.
Hit the jackass!

20:31.780 --> 20:33.860
Ow! Hey!

20:33.940 --> 20:36.020
Steven! Just listen...
