00:52.301 --> 00:53.841
Liverpool!

00:53.967 --> 00:55.377
Beatles!

01:16.009 --> 01:17.219
Liverpool!

01:19.634 --> 01:20.634
Hello.

03:46.092 --> 03:48.382
Elaine! I wish you'd hurry up.

03:48.509 --> 03:50.259
I'll see you. Ta-ra.

03:54.884 --> 03:57.434
- Anyway, who was he?
- The bus driver. Who do you think?

03:57.551 --> 04:00.881
- Do you know him?
- Only as well as you can know a driver.

04:01.801 --> 04:05.051
- Have you heard from Mick lately?
- Mm. He rang my mum's earlier on.

04:05.176 --> 04:07.376
To tell you the truth,
I can't be arsed with him.

04:07.509 --> 04:09.799
- Why not?
- Oh, he's off his mong, isn't he?

04:09.926 --> 04:12.626
He's just into lounging round
and smoking pot.

04:12.759 --> 04:14.009
I like him.

04:14.134 --> 04:17.303
I suppose he's all right,
but you get a bit bored, don't you?

04:17.426 --> 04:21.505
I've been courting him 14 months now
and the novelty wears off after a while.

04:21.634 --> 04:24.634
Hm. Suppose so.
Do you think he'll be in here?

04:24.759 --> 04:26.799
God, I hope not.
I want to cop off tonight.

04:26.926 --> 04:28.926
- I couldn't be bothered myself.
- What?

04:29.051 --> 04:31.761
I'm sick of the men up here.
They've got no romance in them.

04:31.884 --> 04:34.884
Well, Kirkby isn't
the most romantic place in the world.

04:35.009 --> 04:37.969
That's what I mean. It's a bore.
Don't you ever get sick of it?

04:38.092 --> 04:40.762
No, I don't. I'm too busy working
to get sick of it.

04:40.884 --> 04:43.764
- You're one of the lucky ones.
- Suppose you're right.

04:43.884 --> 04:47.594
Fucking hell. That's not the rain, is it?
My hair will get ruined.

04:47.717 --> 04:51.297
See what I mean? I wish I was
in Casablanca or somewhere like that.

04:51.426 --> 04:54.966
- You know, all hot and exotic.
- It rains in Casablanca as well, you know.

04:55.092 --> 04:58.262
Get away! Does it?
The things you learn outside a pub.

04:58.384 --> 05:01.344
Do I look OK? Is my mazzie smudged?
And has my hair stayed up?

05:01.467 --> 05:04.297
Tracy, you threw a can of lacquer on it
before you came out.

05:04.426 --> 05:07.376
It'd take a monsoon to shift that lot.
Now, come on.

05:32.176 --> 05:33.716
Oh, hi, Teresa.

05:33.842 --> 05:36.132
Hiya, Elaine. Hi, Tracy.

05:37.884 --> 05:40.344
Ooh, let's squeeze my arse in
next to yous.

05:41.717 --> 05:44.547
- You just finished work?
- Yeah, there was overtime going.

05:44.676 --> 05:47.506
Should have finished at five.
It isn't half packed in here.

05:47.634 --> 05:49.684
Still at the chicken factory, then?

05:49.801 --> 05:53.051
- Yeah, but it's doing my head in.
- What exactly do you do?

05:53.176 --> 05:57.376
Take the innards out of chickens,
put them into bags and stuff them back up.

05:57.509 --> 05:59.299
They play this classical music shite

05:59.426 --> 06:02.216
but they speed it up bit by bit
throughout the day

06:02.342 --> 06:05.342
and you end up stuffing chickens
in time to the music.

06:05.467 --> 06:07.797
God, how disgusting.
Your hands must stink.

06:07.926 --> 06:11.546
So would yours if you had them
stuffed up chicken's arses all day.

06:11.676 --> 06:13.126
Any scandal?

06:13.259 --> 06:15.799
I was just telling Elaine
about that girl over there.

06:15.926 --> 06:17.256
What girl?

06:17.384 --> 06:20.804
Remember? You told me about her
giving a wank to a fella from St Marion's.

06:20.926 --> 06:22.676
- I never.
- You did.

06:22.801 --> 06:26.631
I said she went round the back with him
but I didn't see what happened after that.

06:26.759 --> 06:29.049
I was just fuming
cos he didn't wanna go with me.

06:29.176 --> 06:32.716
What man in his right mind would refuse
a dollop of what I've got to offer?

06:32.842 --> 06:35.592
She's a little skut.
I'm sure she fancies my Mick.

06:35.717 --> 06:37.047
Oh, come on, Tracy.

06:37.176 --> 06:39.046
- We've all done it.
- Done what?

06:39.176 --> 06:41.546
Given wanks and had our tits felt,
and loved it.

06:41.676 --> 06:44.586
It's just that some people get caught
and some people don't.

06:44.717 --> 06:49.177
Don't put me in the same category as her
cos I'm a different type of girl to that.

06:49.301 --> 06:52.181
Oh, all right, Tracy. Leave it out.
She's only a kid.

06:52.301 --> 06:55.381
- Forget it before it gets out of hand.
- I'm going to the toilet.

06:57.384 --> 06:58.804
What are you doing with her?

06:58.926 --> 07:02.336
I know she's a nice girl and everything
but she can be one jealous bitch.

07:04.842 --> 07:06.932
You know Mick fucked her off, don't you?

07:07.051 --> 07:10.471
- I thought it was the other way round.
- No. She wants people to think that.

07:10.592 --> 07:14.262
He fucked her off
and copped off with her over there.

07:15.676 --> 07:18.546
- Had we better go over?
- No, it will be OK.

07:18.676 --> 07:21.966
And you, you shouldn't
even be in here at your age,

07:22.092 --> 07:25.262
never mind sniffing round fellas
old enough to be your father.

07:25.384 --> 07:27.724
- Hi, Teresa. Hi, Elaine.
- Hiya, Mick.

07:27.842 --> 07:31.382
If you so much as glance sideways
at my Mick

07:31.509 --> 07:34.469
you'll see the end of my stiletto
up the crack of your arse.

07:34.592 --> 07:36.762
Hey, get here.

07:36.884 --> 07:38.724
I said get here!

07:46.134 --> 07:48.554
- Who are you with?
- Bimbo and Jonno.

07:48.676 --> 07:50.926
We've come from the Tod.
Do you wanna sit with us?

07:51.051 --> 07:55.881
- Yeah, I'll be over in a minute.
- Don't suppose you've got any money?

07:56.009 --> 07:58.219
- How much do you want?
- Can you hand us a bluey?

07:58.342 --> 07:59.682
Yeah, hang on a minute.

08:10.092 --> 08:12.302
Oh, Mick, look.
There's that fiver I owe you.

08:12.426 --> 08:15.046
Oh, ta, Tracy.
I'll just go and get a drink in.

08:15.176 --> 08:17.506
- Do you want one?
- Oh, no, thanks.

08:17.634 --> 08:18.934
What about you two?

08:19.051 --> 08:21.551
All right, then. See yous later.

08:21.676 --> 08:23.526
I'll be over in a minute.

08:25.676 --> 08:29.546
- He must have been looking out for me.
- He was looking out for your purse.

08:29.676 --> 08:33.216
He's normally loaded.
It's just that he's been laid off.

08:33.342 --> 08:36.011
Anyway, I'll get over and have a gab.
See you later.

08:36.134 --> 08:38.094
- Yeah, see you later, Tracy.
- Ta-ra.

08:39.217 --> 08:40.876
Oh, thank God he came in.

08:41.009 --> 08:43.589
I couldn't put up
with her whinging gob much longer.

08:43.717 --> 08:47.587
- Do you fancy going somewhere else?
- Like where? There's nowhere up here.

08:47.717 --> 08:50.007
I fancy going into town but I'm skint.

08:50.134 --> 08:52.434
I'd offer to take you
but I've only got mam's wages

08:52.551 --> 08:55.261
and if I don't give them to her,
she'll chaw the face off me.

08:55.384 --> 08:56.804
Purse strings are tight.

08:56.926 --> 09:00.626
I wasn't dropping hints.
I just fancy getting away for a few hours.

09:00.759 --> 09:01.929
I know.

09:19.592 --> 09:22.682
Oh, fuck my mam and her wages.
Let's jump a taxi into town.

09:22.801 --> 09:24.931
- But she'll chaw the face off you.
- She will,

09:25.051 --> 09:29.381
but with a bit of luck I won't feel a thing
because I intend to get fucking legless.

09:30.092 --> 09:31.842
You were giving her the eye.

09:31.967 --> 09:34.337
- I only winked.
- Did she wink back at you?

09:34.467 --> 09:36.007
- I can't help that.
- Can't you?

09:36.134 --> 09:38.764
I'll wink the eyes out of your sockets
if you do it again.

09:38.884 --> 09:41.684
- Will you?
- Yeah, you heard me.

09:41.801 --> 09:43.551
Oh, do one, woman!

09:43.676 --> 09:46.256
Mick, you bastard. You've blinded me!

09:55.717 --> 09:57.677
Just look at this city.

09:58.134 --> 10:01.334
Whoever did the planning for all this
wants his balls roasted.

10:01.959 --> 10:03.879
Excuse my language, girls.

10:04.801 --> 10:07.721
- What are we getting a taxi for?
- Just look at that.

10:08.717 --> 10:10.927
We can't afford a taxi.

10:11.051 --> 10:13.301
- Who says we're paying?
- You what?

10:13.426 --> 10:16.216
My grandma used to push
a handcart up that hill

10:16.342 --> 10:19.502
every morning
all the way up to Paddy's market.

10:19.626 --> 10:24.792
Didn't stop till she was in her 70s.
Loaded high it was with vegetables.

10:25.926 --> 10:27.546
Done her in in the end.

10:27.676 --> 10:30.966
Got the wheel of the barrow
caught in the tramlines and pop.

10:31.092 --> 10:33.682
That was that.
All the gear fell off the barrow.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.467
Right on top of her.

10:36.592 --> 10:40.092
It was the oranges that did it.
Never mind laughing.

10:40.217 --> 10:42.427
How would you like it
if your granny was buried

10:42.551 --> 10:44.631
under two hundredweight of satsumas?

10:47.092 --> 10:48.722
Is that a joint you're smoking?

10:50.842 --> 10:52.092
Pass it here, then.

11:08.926 --> 11:11.796
- Here you are. Keep the change.
- Oh, thanks very much.

11:11.926 --> 11:14.296
- I thought you weren't gonna pay?
- He's one of us.

11:14.426 --> 11:16.806
- See ya.
- Ta-ra.

11:28.217 --> 11:30.427
Oh, dance with me, Charlie.

11:31.717 --> 11:33.177
Go on.

11:49.426 --> 11:51.376
- Thanks.
- Hiya, Rose.

11:51.509 --> 11:52.509
Hi.

11:56.217 --> 11:59.797
She's a marvellous girl.
We were in here one night.

11:59.926 --> 12:02.256
We'd been on a bender in town.
Off our cakes.

12:02.384 --> 12:05.474
Cops off with two Norskies
and bails back to the ship.

12:05.592 --> 12:08.432
- So, what happened?
- I don't remember.

12:08.551 --> 12:11.221
I just woke up
with my knicker elastic around my neck.

12:11.342 --> 12:13.052
You dirty mare!

12:13.176 --> 12:16.506
- Excuse me. You dance with me?
- No, thanks. I'm just having a drink.

12:17.884 --> 12:20.764
Look, do you mind?
I'm not a cheap piece of meat.

12:20.884 --> 12:23.514
- OK, I'm sorry.
- Well, just don't paw me, OK?

12:23.634 --> 12:26.474
- I'll buy you a drink.
- I don't want a drink. I've got one.

12:26.592 --> 12:29.222
Here, all right.
I'll have a drink off yous.

12:29.342 --> 12:31.842
- Would you like to dance with me?
- No, she wouldn't.

12:31.967 --> 12:34.757
OK, I'll pay for a dance.
How much you want? £5? £10?

12:34.884 --> 12:37.014
- I pay for a dance, yeah?
- Look here, you.

12:37.134 --> 12:41.014
Now, wait. You put your money away.
We don't want your money off you.

12:41.134 --> 12:43.934
I'll have a dance with you,
nice-looking lad like you.

12:44.051 --> 12:45.591
Here, watch my bag.

12:47.301 --> 12:49.011
Dimitri, he's OK.

12:50.092 --> 12:51.722
My name is Rayner. And you?

12:52.592 --> 12:53.802
Elaine.

13:15.426 --> 13:17.256
So, where are you from, then, Rayner?

13:17.384 --> 13:20.554
Oh, I come from Cyprus
but I've been in England now 12 years.

13:20.676 --> 13:23.586
- And you? You are from Liverpool?
- Yeah.

13:23.717 --> 13:26.877
I mean, no. Me and my mate
are from a place called Southport.

13:27.009 --> 13:30.509
Ah, I don't know Southport.
Perhaps you will show me around?

13:30.634 --> 13:32.094
Yeah, I will.

13:33.926 --> 13:36.256
Ooh, this drink's gone
right through my system.

13:36.384 --> 13:39.384
I'm gonna have to go to the lav.
You know, lavabos.

13:41.051 --> 13:42.221
Elaine.

13:43.676 --> 13:45.876
I'm just going to powder my nose, love.

13:46.009 --> 13:49.179
- OK. You're coming back, yeah?
- Yeah, I'll be back in a minute.

13:54.384 --> 13:55.224
Hey!

13:59.967 --> 14:01.587
Come on, soft girl.

14:03.551 --> 14:06.261
Here's your winnings.
Half of it's yours, you know.

14:06.384 --> 14:08.094
I don't want half, Teresa.

14:08.217 --> 14:11.427
- What's wrong?
- I just don't like dipping people.

14:11.551 --> 14:14.511
But they wanted to buy us,
two prime pieces of beef.

14:14.634 --> 14:16.384
They only wanted a dance.

14:16.509 --> 14:18.259
They wanted to buy a dance.

14:18.967 --> 14:21.717
They got the most expensive dance
in the world.

14:23.551 --> 14:25.761
What if they see us again?
What if they spot us?

14:25.884 --> 14:29.314
Don't be daft. What are the chances
of bumping into them two again?

14:33.134 --> 14:34.524
Hey!

14:44.176 --> 14:45.966
Get off her!

15:15.134 --> 15:16.974
- When did you learn how to drive?
- Now.

15:17.092 --> 15:18.332
Oh!

15:45.676 --> 15:48.276
You're looking cushty tonight, girls.

15:48.801 --> 15:50.801
- Are we all right?
- Yeah, go on.

15:57.676 --> 16:00.586
Hang on. I won't be a minute.
Just going in here.

17:33.051 --> 17:34.681
Evening, gentlemen.

17:48.134 --> 17:49.974
£2 each, please.

17:51.301 --> 17:53.051
Hey!

17:53.176 --> 17:54.506
Hey, come here!

20:32.009 --> 20:34.759
Teresa! Good God, I didn't recognise you.

20:34.884 --> 20:36.974
I know. I look like a little doll, don't I?

20:37.092 --> 20:39.682
You look gorgeous
but where did you get all the gear?

20:39.801 --> 20:42.381
Never go anywhere without my bits,
just in case!

20:42.509 --> 20:44.299
Why not dress like that all the time?

20:44.426 --> 20:46.626
I'd rather go into work
looking plain and that.

20:46.759 --> 20:49.929
Surprises the fellas
when they see me looking like this.

20:54.967 --> 20:57.217
You look a bit weird.
Do you feel all right?

20:57.342 --> 21:00.632
I feel fine. I've just spotted
a gorgeous fella sitting over there.

21:00.759 --> 21:02.969
Oh, he's lovely, Teresa.
Wait till you see him.

21:03.092 --> 21:06.592
Wait, my arse! Let's zhoosh ourselves
over there and get a slice of man

21:06.717 --> 21:09.967
before some other floozies
get their nails into them.

21:10.092 --> 21:12.182
Don't make it obvious. Play hard to get.

21:12.301 --> 21:14.511
A little bit of cat and mouse,
a bit of tease.

21:14.634 --> 21:17.434
- I'll just go and get a light off them.
- Teresa, don't.

21:56.509 --> 21:58.929
Sailors! Ooh, I just love sailors.

21:59.051 --> 22:00.761
No one told me there was a ship in.

22:00.884 --> 22:03.054
Well, what happened? ls he looking at me?

22:03.176 --> 22:05.296
- Which one?
- Don't look now.

22:05.426 --> 22:08.046
The one with the blond hair,
see if he's giving me the eye.

22:08.176 --> 22:10.876
Elaine, they're one their way over.

22:14.134 --> 22:16.474
Remember what I said. Play hard to get.

22:21.134 --> 22:22.634
Excuse me.

22:22.759 --> 22:26.879
Would you and your friend
like to join our company?

22:27.009 --> 22:28.839
Do you fancy it, Elaine?

22:28.967 --> 22:32.127
- Here, why don't you join us?
- Here?

22:39.551 --> 22:43.431
- I see you're a sailor.
- 'Course he's a sailor, soft arse.

22:44.967 --> 22:48.547
Er, my name is Peter.
This is my friend, Sergei.

22:49.384 --> 22:52.344
Pleased to meet you, Peter, Sergei.

22:52.467 --> 22:55.007
My name's Elaine and this is Teresa.

22:55.134 --> 22:58.514
Hey, with a name like Sergei,
you've gotta be from somewhere like...

22:58.634 --> 22:59.934
Norway.

23:00.051 --> 23:01.471
Norvegiya!

23:01.592 --> 23:03.552
What about Sweden, then?

23:03.676 --> 23:06.756
I could have swore
you're from somewhere cold like that.

23:06.884 --> 23:09.384
- Yous are from Russia.
- Hey, how do you know that?

23:09.509 --> 23:11.589
I read about it in the Echo tonight.

23:11.717 --> 23:15.467
Aren't yous here on some public relations
exercise or something like that?

23:15.592 --> 23:17.762
Er, it's something like that, yeah.

23:19.051 --> 23:21.511
Hey, Igor, do you wanna dance?

23:30.217 --> 23:32.547
How long are you in Liverpool for?

23:32.676 --> 23:35.626
Er, for just one day.
Tomorrow to Scotland.

23:35.759 --> 23:39.759
And after, home to Soviet Union.

23:39.884 --> 23:41.844
I'd love to go to Russia.

23:41.967 --> 23:44.257
- Where are you from? Moscow?
- No.

23:44.384 --> 23:48.594
I'm from the south.
It's a very small town on the Black Sea.

23:48.717 --> 23:50.837
What's it like there? Is it nice?

23:50.967 --> 23:52.427
Very beautiful.

23:52.551 --> 23:57.881
People from all over Soviet Union
go there in summer for beach.

23:58.009 --> 24:01.259
I always thought
Russia was supposed to be dead cold.

24:01.384 --> 24:04.764
Is many climates in Soviet Union,

24:04.884 --> 24:06.884
many different climates, not like here.

24:11.426 --> 24:15.126
I see your friend, she likes
to have a good time with the men.

24:15.259 --> 24:19.009
Yeah, she works long hours
in the chicken factory, see,

24:19.134 --> 24:22.224
so when she finishes work
she likes to go out and have a good time.

24:23.926 --> 24:26.466
And you, do you work?

24:26.592 --> 24:31.222
No. I wish I did but there's a work problem
in England at the moment.

24:31.342 --> 24:34.972
You know, in Soviet Union,
if you don't work you don't eat.

24:35.092 --> 24:37.342
It's a bit like that here as well.

24:37.467 --> 24:39.377
So you don't eat?

24:39.509 --> 24:42.179
Well, no, no, no.
It's not quite that bad yet.

24:45.259 --> 24:47.089
He's a big lad, isn't he?

24:48.009 --> 24:49.839
Does he come from the same place as you?

24:49.967 --> 24:51.547
No, he's from Leningrad.

24:52.884 --> 24:56.014
You know, it's his first time
outside Soviet Union.

24:56.134 --> 24:57.974
He's having a good time.

25:01.384 --> 25:03.304
You don't like to dance?

25:03.426 --> 25:04.796
Are you asking?

27:39.884 --> 27:42.684
What do you reckon, then?
My one's gorgeous.

27:42.801 --> 27:44.841
Reminds me of that fella
in <i>Doctor Zhivago.</i>

27:44.967 --> 27:46.967
He's nothing like Omar Sharif.

27:47.092 --> 27:50.052
He's got the same accent.
You can imagine, can't you?

27:50.176 --> 27:52.466
You should see
the lovely big, thick arms on him.

27:52.592 --> 27:54.262
I love men with thick arms.

27:54.384 --> 27:56.974
- What's your one like?
- Oh, he's gorgeous.

27:57.092 --> 27:59.632
He's got lovely eyes.

27:59.759 --> 28:03.379
So, um, what do you fancy
doing with them eyes later?

28:04.342 --> 28:05.382
Oh, I don't know.

28:05.509 --> 28:09.429
They're both dead nice and everything
but they both might be a bit strange.

28:09.551 --> 28:11.971
And what's wrong with a bit of strange?

28:12.092 --> 28:15.182
You've been whingeing all night
for a bit of romance and adventure.

28:15.301 --> 28:17.931
Here's your chance,
looking at you straight in the face.

28:18.051 --> 28:20.761
My one just kissed the gob off me
and I don't know about you

28:20.884 --> 28:23.054
but I'm getting in there
for another slice of the cake.

28:23.176 --> 28:24.626
They're gorgeous, Elaine,

28:24.759 --> 28:26.969
better than anything
we'll find round here,

28:27.092 --> 28:29.222
so get your laughing gear round him.

28:29.342 --> 28:31.052
Yeah, you're right. Come on.

28:45.176 --> 28:47.716
You did tell them
we were going to the toilet?

28:47.842 --> 28:49.972
No, I thought you told them.

28:50.092 --> 28:51.932
Oh, well, they've gone off on us.

28:52.051 --> 28:53.261
Come on.

29:03.801 --> 29:04.801
Look.

29:15.217 --> 29:17.427
Wait!

29:17.551 --> 29:18.551
Teresa!

29:25.092 --> 29:28.222
I think somebody's just flung themselves
under the bus.

29:28.342 --> 29:30.802
- Accident.
- Mm, under the bus.

29:30.926 --> 29:33.216
- Why?
- Oh, it's always happening.

29:33.342 --> 29:36.382
They'll scrape the body off the bus
and we'll move off in a minute.

29:36.509 --> 29:38.629
I hope we don't have to change buses.

29:38.759 --> 29:41.999
- It always happens on the last bus.
- Yes.

29:45.551 --> 29:47.471
Hiya! Fancy bumping into you.

29:47.592 --> 29:50.592
- Teresa! Where is Elaine?
- Come on. What are yous waiting for?

29:56.342 --> 29:58.882
Sorry about that, girls,
but we was here first.

29:59.009 --> 30:01.759
We don't care.
They bored the liver out of us, anyway.

30:01.884 --> 30:03.884
- Didn't they?
- Mm, very boring.

30:04.009 --> 30:05.219
Oh, ta-ra.

30:21.467 --> 30:23.007
Come on!

30:36.134 --> 30:38.974
It's a very beautiful evening.

30:39.092 --> 30:40.842
Yeah, it's lovely, isn't it?

30:42.217 --> 30:44.717
So, what's it like in Russia, then?

30:44.842 --> 30:47.052
It's very different from here.

30:47.176 --> 30:48.586
In what way?

30:50.176 --> 30:52.006
Russian poetry.

30:52.134 --> 30:55.724
Russia cannot be understood by wit alone.

30:57.092 --> 31:00.472
Common measures cannot be applied to her.

31:00.592 --> 31:03.132
She has a special character.

31:04.176 --> 31:06.926
One must simply believe in Russia.

31:09.092 --> 31:11.092
But what about all the food shortages?

31:12.592 --> 31:14.512
There are no food shortages.

31:14.634 --> 31:18.384
But we read about it in the papers,
about how you have to queue for food.

31:18.509 --> 31:20.549
We read same about you.

31:20.676 --> 31:23.046
Queues are not caused by shortages.

31:23.176 --> 31:27.676
Queues are formed because
the person in charge of distribution

31:27.801 --> 31:29.221
is a cretin.

31:30.384 --> 31:32.594
The only real shortage in Soviet Union

31:33.967 --> 31:36.377
is that of beautiful girls.

31:38.467 --> 31:39.467
Like you.

31:42.051 --> 31:44.181
I'm a secretary, me, you know.

31:44.301 --> 31:46.341
I get to answer the phone and that.

31:46.467 --> 31:48.217
Good morning. Davis and Timmons.

31:48.342 --> 31:51.302
Can I help you? Can I put you through?

31:51.426 --> 31:53.836
What do you get to do
on the ship, then, Igor?

31:55.009 --> 31:57.259
Oh, Sergei.

31:58.634 --> 32:01.974
Christ, talk about Roman hands
and Russian fingers.

32:02.092 --> 32:03.972
Come on, Igor. Food first.

32:04.092 --> 32:05.512
Filth later.

32:08.592 --> 32:11.222
Hey, do you see that star?

32:12.092 --> 32:13.682
Which one? That big one there?

32:13.801 --> 32:15.931
Yes, the brightest one in the sky.

32:16.051 --> 32:18.221
It reminds me of my home.

32:18.342 --> 32:22.592
Every night from my bed I look through
my window and see it shining in the sky.

32:22.717 --> 32:25.217
And when I am away from Soviet Union

32:25.342 --> 32:29.432
I look to the star
and it makes me feel at home.

32:30.426 --> 32:32.716
Well, from now on
every time I see that star

32:32.842 --> 32:34.682
it will remind me of you.

32:36.009 --> 32:39.759
- I never hit you.
- Lying bastard. You did.

32:39.884 --> 32:43.084
And you took advantage of me.
I was a virgin.

32:46.426 --> 32:48.006
The local entertainment.

32:48.134 --> 32:50.224
Yeah, the local entertainment.

32:51.259 --> 32:53.549
That's what happens
when you have to give up.

32:53.676 --> 32:55.006
What?

32:55.134 --> 32:56.804
Oh, nothing. Come on.

33:00.634 --> 33:04.764
Same bastard place every time we come out.

33:04.884 --> 33:07.514
Same smelly old Chinese chippy.

33:08.551 --> 33:10.181
We don't even order any more.

33:11.051 --> 33:13.841
Sweet and sour for me
and curried beef for you.

33:13.967 --> 33:16.627
All right, if you don't fancy it
we'll get off.

33:16.759 --> 33:19.589
All right, Charlie. I'm hungry.

33:19.717 --> 33:22.127
- You're always fucking hungry.
- Oh.

33:23.634 --> 33:26.974
I bet you've got lovely big thick muscles,
have you, Igor?

33:28.592 --> 33:31.972
What do you reckon on that?
That's my chicken arm.

33:32.092 --> 33:35.512
800 chickens' arses a day I do with that.

33:37.217 --> 33:38.257
Come on.

33:51.301 --> 33:54.551
- Where are we gonna go after this?
- Let's all bail back to the ship.

33:54.676 --> 33:56.876
- We can't.
- What?

33:57.009 --> 34:00.429
Peter just told me it's against regulations
to have people on the ship.

34:00.551 --> 34:02.931
Fucking hell. What type of ship is it?

34:03.051 --> 34:05.721
- Can't they sneak us back?
- No, they can't.

34:05.842 --> 34:07.512
Well, what are we gonna do, then?

34:09.676 --> 34:11.966
We could go and get a hotel.

34:12.092 --> 34:15.512
But these two don't look
like they've got a rouble between them.

34:15.634 --> 34:17.224
But we've got all that money.

34:17.342 --> 34:20.882
Elaine, hotels are dead expensive.
It will cost us a bomb.

34:25.551 --> 34:26.971
Oh, go on, Teresa.

34:27.092 --> 34:30.431
If it's the money, I'll pay you back.
It's just I'm really into him.

34:30.551 --> 34:32.221
I've never felt like this before.

34:33.676 --> 34:35.085
Go on, please.

34:37.051 --> 34:39.051
Looks like I've got no option, doesn't it?

34:40.342 --> 34:41.882
- You still on the pill?
- Yeah.

34:42.009 --> 34:43.339
Which reminds me.

34:44.301 --> 34:46.091
Salt and vinegar?

34:46.217 --> 34:48.127
No, thanks, love. Not on these.

34:48.259 --> 34:49.259
Chicken.

34:49.384 --> 34:52.634
No, that's to stop this chicken
laying an egg.

34:56.592 --> 34:59.632
- Two fish and chips.
- Here you are, love.

35:13.759 --> 35:17.839
Hey, who the fuck
are you giving your dirty looks to?

35:17.967 --> 35:20.377
- Come on, shall we go?
- Think you better had, love.

35:20.509 --> 35:23.929
And you better give your face back
to the second-hand shop you got it from.

35:24.051 --> 35:27.381
- Slut.
- I know. I love it, like yourself.

35:27.509 --> 35:30.089
Fucking Rushies! Hey, where are you going.

35:30.217 --> 35:32.257
Gonna iron this shit out or what?

35:32.384 --> 35:34.134
Bop him, Charlie.

35:34.259 --> 35:35.679
Go on, Charlie.

35:36.342 --> 35:38.742
Charlie, go on!

35:41.134 --> 35:44.554
You... you... you...
Fucking communist aggressors!

35:46.426 --> 35:48.046
Fucking communist aggressors!

35:57.842 --> 35:59.262
It's nice, isn't it?

35:59.384 --> 36:01.844
Yeah. So it should be,
the prices they charge.

36:32.134 --> 36:35.184
Yeah, it's lovely, Elaine.

36:35.301 --> 36:37.551
We must be mad
paying all that money on men.

36:39.051 --> 36:41.011
They should be paying for us, really.

36:42.717 --> 36:44.587
Come on, Teresa.

36:49.051 --> 36:51.551
We're not prostitutes, you know.

36:51.676 --> 36:53.426
Do you wanna know what we are?

36:53.551 --> 36:56.631
Desperate, fucking desperate.

36:56.759 --> 36:59.009
God, I feel like an old boot,
paying for men.

37:00.967 --> 37:04.627
I know it's a lot of money and that,
but we did get it dead easy, didn't we?

37:06.467 --> 37:11.127
You told me off earlier on for whingeing
and not having any sense of adventure.

37:11.259 --> 37:14.129
And you were right.
That's why I suggested coming here.

37:16.134 --> 37:17.934
I'm not like you, Teresa.

37:18.051 --> 37:21.721
I'm just a straight Kirkby girl
with a strong imagination. Nothing else.

37:22.801 --> 37:26.551
Here's my chance for something else,
and yours as well.

37:26.676 --> 37:30.546
Even if it is just for the one night,
we'll always have the memory of it.

37:30.676 --> 37:33.716
And no one can take that
away from us, can they?

37:33.842 --> 37:35.342
Well, can they?

37:35.467 --> 37:37.507
I'm not mean or anything, Elaine.

37:37.634 --> 37:39.554
Oh, I know you're not.

37:39.676 --> 37:44.756
It's just that I work all week in that dump
doing a job that's fucking disgusting.

37:44.884 --> 37:48.094
But the reason I do that job
is because I wanna survive.

37:49.134 --> 37:51.724
I can't bear the idea of being skint.

37:51.842 --> 37:54.682
So when I do get some money
I like to spend it on me.

37:56.259 --> 38:00.259
Anyway, I just don't like the idea
of spending money on men.

38:01.176 --> 38:03.086
Makes me feel cheap,

38:03.217 --> 38:05.257
cheaper than
if they were spending it on me

38:05.384 --> 38:08.634
and I feel like that Sergei's
only here cos I'm paying.

38:08.759 --> 38:11.049
That Sergei's here because he likes you.

38:12.176 --> 38:14.836
- Do you really think so?
- Of course I do.

38:14.967 --> 38:17.427
You can see he gets a laugh out of you.

38:17.551 --> 38:20.181
And he doesn't need a hotel.
He's got a ship to go back to.

38:22.467 --> 38:26.047
He's just into having a little bit of fun
like yourself.

38:26.176 --> 38:28.466
So, what happened
to that slice of the cake, then?

38:28.592 --> 38:30.432
It's in there, waiting to be nibbled.

38:30.551 --> 38:32.801
Oh, come on,
before they do a dusty on us again.

38:33.884 --> 38:35.974
You ain't half a good mate,
you know, Elaine.

38:36.092 --> 38:37.302
So are you, Teresa.

38:38.259 --> 38:41.129
Let's go and get our money's worth
out of them.

38:53.634 --> 38:55.264
Let's have a look at your love line.

38:57.009 --> 38:59.379
Ooh, it's dead strong, that is.

38:59.509 --> 39:00.879
It's pulsating.

39:02.426 --> 39:05.966
There's someone here, really close to you,

39:06.092 --> 39:08.472
you know, someone who loves you a lot,

39:08.592 --> 39:11.842
like maybe a girlfriend

39:11.967 --> 39:13.507
or a wife.

39:19.842 --> 39:21.882
In Soviet Union we are allowed many wives.

39:22.009 --> 39:23.759
- Sergei has ten.
- What?

39:25.884 --> 39:30.224
Oh! What are you doing to me?
I told you he was dead strong.

39:31.551 --> 39:34.721
Listen, if he gets a bit, you know,
and you can't handle it,

39:34.842 --> 39:37.632
just give that wall a good kick
and I'll be in, do you hear me?

39:44.467 --> 39:47.047
She's very protective, your friend.

39:48.259 --> 39:51.509
I think she's a bit worried
in case you turn out to be a sex maniac.

39:51.634 --> 39:53.724
Me? Sex maniac!

39:54.842 --> 39:57.052
Well, I don't know you, do I?

39:57.176 --> 39:59.086
I mean, I am taking a bit of a chance.

39:59.217 --> 40:02.967
No, I don't think you take any chance.

40:05.926 --> 40:07.586
You trust me?

40:07.717 --> 40:09.507
Trust you?

40:09.634 --> 40:11.594
I don't even trust myself.

40:13.384 --> 40:15.054
But there's something about you.

40:27.384 --> 40:29.384
I'm only 26, me.

40:29.509 --> 40:31.179
I'm not married.

40:31.301 --> 40:34.301
I could have been.
I've been engaged four times.

40:37.426 --> 40:40.336
But I've got this thing
about settling down.

40:40.467 --> 40:42.377
You know about me being a secretary?

40:42.509 --> 40:44.469
Well, I get to travel everywhere.

40:44.592 --> 40:46.592
You know, Paris,

40:46.717 --> 40:49.677
New York, Amsterdam.

40:51.009 --> 40:52.629
And the moon,

40:52.759 --> 40:55.629
I get to go to the moon.
Well, I may as well

40:55.759 --> 41:00.089
cos you can't understand
a word I'm saying, can you, Igor?

41:00.217 --> 41:02.547
Your English isn't very good, is it?

41:02.676 --> 41:04.546
Yeah, well, neither's my typing.

41:29.426 --> 41:31.966
I know this sounds a bit stupid

41:32.092 --> 41:34.472
but do you mind
if we just stay like this for a while?

41:35.551 --> 41:36.551
No.

41:37.884 --> 41:39.384
I don't mind.

41:44.634 --> 41:46.844
Close your eyes.

41:46.967 --> 41:50.217
- What for?
- I thought you said you trust me.

41:50.342 --> 41:52.472
- OK, but what for?
- Close.

42:00.717 --> 42:02.507
Look, it's my star.

42:02.634 --> 42:04.014
Oh, Peter!

42:05.842 --> 42:07.382
That's lovely.

42:07.509 --> 42:10.259
I think from now it will remind me of you.

42:10.384 --> 42:12.224
You shouldn't say things like that.

42:13.259 --> 42:16.049
- We've only just met.
- Oh, does it matter?

42:16.176 --> 42:18.046
Of course it matters.

42:18.176 --> 42:21.876
You're going back to Russia tomorrow
and I'm gonna be stuck here.

42:22.009 --> 42:25.549
I just want a night of fun.
You know, nothing heavy.

42:25.676 --> 42:27.256
Is that all you want?

42:27.384 --> 42:29.014
No, of course that's not all.

42:29.759 --> 42:33.259
But you could have given that star story
to every girl you've met.

42:33.384 --> 42:37.014
I could be sharing it with broken hearts
from Bournemouth to Bangkok.

42:37.134 --> 42:38.764
I'm not stupid, you know.

42:38.884 --> 42:41.054
I know what type of life sailors live.

42:41.176 --> 42:45.006
I understand that you've got to give girls
verbal romance to get them into bed.

42:50.217 --> 42:52.967
Well, I'm here, aren't I? On the bed.

42:53.092 --> 42:55.552
So you don't have to waste
your star story on me.

42:57.342 --> 43:02.182
- I don't just want to make love with you.
- Don't you think I'm attractive?

43:02.301 --> 43:04.091
I think you're very beautiful.

43:05.426 --> 43:06.966
But, you see,

43:10.509 --> 43:15.089
it's enough for me also
to just be here with you.

43:16.967 --> 43:18.717
You don't want anything else?

43:20.217 --> 43:21.697
Niet.

43:24.509 --> 43:27.049
You're different from them, Peter.

43:29.051 --> 43:31.181
I think she likes to be spoilt a little.

43:31.301 --> 43:33.131
A little? She thrives on it.

43:34.217 --> 43:35.967
But she hasn't got a star, has she?

44:04.134 --> 44:05.344
Good morning.

44:06.301 --> 44:08.881
- What time is it?
- It's about eight o'clock.

44:10.301 --> 44:13.471
- Have you been awake for a long time?
- About an hour.

44:13.592 --> 44:16.682
I've just been standing here,
thinking about last night.

44:16.801 --> 44:21.431
- I had a really good time.
- Yes, I did too.

44:21.551 --> 44:23.221
- Did you?
- Mm-hm.

44:24.551 --> 44:28.341
You know, I don't have
to be at the ship until 5:30.

44:29.301 --> 44:33.301
If you want, you could
show me around Liverpool.

44:33.426 --> 44:34.626
Around here?

44:35.926 --> 44:39.006
Yeah, all right, but I'm warning you,
there's not much to see.

44:40.259 --> 44:41.429
Not much.

44:58.259 --> 45:00.379
Teresa?

45:00.509 --> 45:02.799
- Teresa?
- Hang on.

45:16.842 --> 45:20.762
- Look at the state of this room.
- It's paid for, isn't it?

45:20.884 --> 45:23.224
- Anyway, what time is it?
- About eight o'clock.

45:23.342 --> 45:25.342
Oh, Christ, I've missed work.

45:25.467 --> 45:27.587
I'll have to send a sick note in.

45:27.717 --> 45:30.047
Do you fancy coming into town
with me and Peter?

45:30.176 --> 45:32.506
Oh, sod that, Elaine. I'm knackered.

45:32.634 --> 45:34.184
He had me going all night.

45:35.676 --> 45:38.176
How did you get on with Peter?
Did you have a good time?

45:38.301 --> 45:40.091
It was lovely. We were up all night.

45:40.217 --> 45:42.467
- Go heck!
- Yeah, talking.

45:42.592 --> 45:46.052
- Talking?
- Yeah. Some people do, you know.

45:46.176 --> 45:49.376
- You didn't give him a good going-over?
- No, I didn't.

45:49.509 --> 45:52.679
- How come?
- I dunno. It just didn't seem to matter.

45:52.801 --> 45:55.221
Well, it mattered to me.
He had me going all night.

45:55.342 --> 45:58.092
Admittedly, he was a bit difficult
to get started

45:58.217 --> 46:01.047
but once I got his juices flowing,
there was no stopping him.

46:01.176 --> 46:03.086
He had me everywhere. It was marvellous.

46:03.217 --> 46:05.007
Shut up. He might hear you.

46:05.134 --> 46:08.054
Fuck him. I hope he does.
I could do with another ten minutes.

46:08.176 --> 46:10.676
- God, you're sex-starved, you are.
- Sex-starved?

46:10.801 --> 46:13.881
Not me, love.
I'm full to the brim with him.

46:14.009 --> 46:15.469
I just want more.

46:15.592 --> 46:18.722
Well, look, these two have got
to be back at the ship for 5:30.

46:18.842 --> 46:21.632
- Do you fancy meeting us in town?
- Yeah, OK.

46:21.759 --> 46:23.549
- Where?
- How about the pier head?

46:24.384 --> 46:27.764
- God, you lazy mare.
- I've been using up a lot of energy.

46:35.134 --> 46:36.344
Igor?

46:37.592 --> 46:39.342
Igor?

46:39.467 --> 46:41.177
I'm lonely.

49:55.176 --> 49:57.256
I like it, the ferry.

49:57.384 --> 49:58.804
It's not bad, is it?

49:58.926 --> 50:01.426
Me and my sister used to come here
when we were kids.

50:01.551 --> 50:03.761
Mum used to give us 50p
and throw us out the house

50:03.884 --> 50:06.384
so she could get on
with doing the Sunday dinner.

50:06.509 --> 50:10.129
We used to sit up here all day,
going backwards and forwards.

50:10.259 --> 50:12.129
It was really nice.

50:12.259 --> 50:15.129
We used to buy a bottle of lemonade,
some sarnies...

50:15.259 --> 50:16.929
Sarnies? What?

50:17.051 --> 50:19.051
You know, sandwiches. These!

50:20.842 --> 50:24.092
I never used to eat mine, though.
I used to feed them to the seagulls.

50:24.217 --> 50:25.837
I think they're lovely. Don't you?

50:27.676 --> 50:31.006
Sometimes they follow the ship
for days or even weeks.

50:31.134 --> 50:33.384
- What for?
- Food.

50:33.509 --> 50:34.509
Oh.

50:36.426 --> 50:40.256
Yes, I love seagulls.

50:40.384 --> 50:42.304
I used to wish I was a bird, you know.

50:42.426 --> 50:45.336
So I could fly away
and build a nest in Africa or America

50:45.467 --> 50:47.467
or wherever it is they fly to.

50:47.592 --> 50:49.632
Just to be free
with no worries or anything.

50:53.134 --> 50:55.384
Here you are, birdies.

50:57.009 --> 50:59.179
They don't have to worry about work.

50:59.301 --> 51:02.551
They're just up there flapping their wings
and having a good time.

51:06.676 --> 51:07.876
I love you.

51:09.801 --> 51:12.091
No, you don't. You love the seagulls.

51:13.426 --> 51:17.086
I haven't got wings, Peter.
I can't follow your ship for days or weeks.

51:17.217 --> 51:20.927
I'm just Elaine. Remember?
You met me in that nightclub last night.

51:22.384 --> 51:25.474
- But I want to make...
- Don't say it, not for the sake of it.

51:25.592 --> 51:27.382
I only want more time with me.

51:27.509 --> 51:31.839
You must know how I feel, what I mean.

51:31.967 --> 51:33.797
Of course I do.

51:33.926 --> 51:35.546
I feel exactly the same.

51:40.717 --> 51:42.837
I've dreamt about you.

51:42.967 --> 51:46.177
I suppose it's just a typical
bored teenager's dream.

51:46.301 --> 51:48.261
The handsome man from the mysterious East

51:48.384 --> 51:49.934
coming and whisking you away.

51:51.092 --> 51:53.262
But it doesn't happen like that, does it?

51:53.384 --> 51:55.224
It's like feeding the seagulls.

51:55.342 --> 51:58.052
You think that seagull,
the one that just ate your sarnie,

51:58.176 --> 51:59.586
will love you for it.

51:59.717 --> 52:02.507
But it doesn't.
It doesn't know it's just ate your dinner

52:02.634 --> 52:05.264
and even if it did,
it wouldn't make any difference.

52:38.051 --> 52:42.971
Please, Elaine. You make me so happy.
I don't want to go away, not like this.

52:43.092 --> 52:45.132
But you don't understand.

52:45.259 --> 52:47.589
You don't know me and I don't know you.

52:47.717 --> 52:50.627
We only met last night
and we'll probably never meet again.

52:52.842 --> 52:55.932
No, we will meet again. Look.

52:59.009 --> 53:01.839
This belonged to my grandfather.
I want you to have it.

53:01.967 --> 53:04.377
- I couldn't take that off you.
- Please, you must.

53:04.509 --> 53:08.469
You see, if you do, it means
that we must... meet again.

53:10.092 --> 53:12.302
Oh, I love you as well, you know.

53:12.426 --> 53:15.586
But it's just that in a few hours
you're gonna be so far away.

53:15.717 --> 53:17.717
You must think of the next time we meet.

53:19.051 --> 53:21.381
It's all too much
for my little brain to handle.

53:21.509 --> 53:23.549
We don't normally do it
like this in Kirkby.

53:24.801 --> 53:27.881
But for all I've just said,
I'd go to the ends of the Earth with you.

54:24.926 --> 54:27.126
I feel like a criminal, standing here.

54:27.259 --> 54:30.529
- What time do you have to be on board?
- In about four minutes.

54:33.467 --> 54:34.967
I want you. I want you to marry me.

54:35.092 --> 54:37.092
I have nothing to gain. Nothing, just you.

54:37.217 --> 54:39.967
- It takes a bit longer than a few minutes.
- Please.

54:40.092 --> 54:41.802
Oh, Peter, it's off its head.

54:41.926 --> 54:44.376
How can I marry you
if I'm here and you're in Russia?

54:44.509 --> 54:46.469
It won't be forever. We will be together.

54:46.592 --> 54:49.682
When, Peter? When?
Oh, why did it have to happen to me?

54:49.801 --> 54:52.131
Why couldn't I have got
into someone from Kirkby?

54:52.259 --> 54:55.089
Just don't forget me, OK?
I'll always love you, you know.

54:58.509 --> 55:01.179
- I must go.
- Can't you wait just a little bit longer?

55:01.301 --> 55:03.091
No, I must go.

55:03.884 --> 55:07.094
But remember,
you look to the star and think of me.

55:47.759 --> 55:48.969
Chicken.

56:35.759 --> 56:38.629
I'm not going back there, Peter.
I wanna stay here with you.

56:46.259 --> 56:48.299
It's impossible.

56:48.426 --> 56:51.046
If you are caught,
we will both be sent to prison.

56:52.051 --> 56:54.301
But I'd rather have that
than be left back there.

58:25.676 --> 58:29.126
Elaine, stop dreaming your life away.
Your tea's ready.

58:31.509 --> 58:32.879
I don't want any.

58:51.159 --> 58:53.546
Oh, Elaine, I was watching that.

58:53.676 --> 58:56.126
You was watching that
but you're not now, are you?

58:56.259 --> 58:58.219
Yeah, well, I want this side on.

58:58.342 --> 59:01.432
I've been watching it since school.
I watch it every night.

59:01.551 --> 59:04.471
Which is why I'm gonna watch
something else for a change.

59:04.592 --> 59:06.842
- Now, turn that telly over.
- I won't.

59:06.967 --> 59:08.967
- You will.
- Piss off, you.

59:09.092 --> 59:11.972
Cheeky bastard.
Are you looking for a smack in the face?

59:12.092 --> 59:14.092
- Off you?
- Yeah, off me.

59:14.217 --> 59:16.837
- Who do you think you are?
- Who do you think YOU are?

59:16.967 --> 59:19.507
- I'm not scared of you.
- You will be in a minute

59:19.634 --> 59:21.054
when I rag the face off you.

59:21.176 --> 59:22.836
Anyway, it's not your telly.

59:22.967 --> 59:24.547
It's not anyone's telly, is it?

59:24.676 --> 59:27.586
It's rented, like everything else
in this fucking dump.

59:27.717 --> 59:31.547
So why don't you do something
really constructive like...

59:31.676 --> 59:34.676
Aye-aye! Get off her, you,
you vicious little mare.

59:34.801 --> 59:37.761
What's going on in here?
You're like a pair of fucking animals.

59:37.884 --> 59:40.634
I won't have her talk to me
like I'm a piece of shite.

59:40.759 --> 59:43.259
I never! She came in
and started shouting at me.

59:43.384 --> 59:45.884
She's one hard-faced gasser.
She told me to piss off.

59:46.009 --> 59:48.339
I know I did,
because you were picking on me.

59:48.467 --> 59:51.257
I'll do more than pick on you,
I'm telling you.

59:51.384 --> 59:53.014
You're telling no one nothing.

59:53.134 --> 59:55.304
I'm her mother, not you,
so leave her alone.

59:55.426 --> 59:59.626
OK? And you stop whingeing,
you crying little cow.

59:59.759 --> 01:00:04.089
You've been looking for any excuse lately
for an argument and I'm not having it.

01:00:04.217 --> 01:00:08.047
What must this lot next door be thinking
with all the effing and blinding going on?

01:00:08.176 --> 01:00:11.756
Fucking pack it in now, OK?

01:00:11.884 --> 01:00:13.384
Josie, get in here.

01:00:17.217 --> 01:00:18.927
There was nothing on the other side.

01:00:19.051 --> 01:00:21.301
Just go and play with your acne.

01:00:37.967 --> 01:00:39.757
How long have you been a model, then?

01:00:39.884 --> 01:00:43.434
Ages. I was in <i>Amateur Gardening</i>
last week, standing next to a privet bush.

01:01:05.926 --> 01:01:07.296
Hiya.

01:01:11.092 --> 01:01:12.132
Nice one.

01:01:15.009 --> 01:01:17.509
How about me and you
having a wander down the west wing

01:01:17.634 --> 01:01:20.344
and having a bounce
on the four-poster bed?

01:01:20.467 --> 01:01:22.837
While there's dogs in the street?

01:02:02.217 --> 01:02:05.717
I told you I shouldn't have come.
I'm only gonna spoil your night.

01:02:05.842 --> 01:02:09.552
- What's up?
- What do you think?

01:02:09.676 --> 01:02:12.126
He wants to marry me. Some joke.

01:02:12.259 --> 01:02:14.469
Some fucking big joke

01:02:14.592 --> 01:02:16.512
and it's all on me.

01:02:16.634 --> 01:02:19.804
I don't know what you're crying for.
I'm flogging my golly all night

01:02:19.926 --> 01:02:22.876
and you've got them eating
out of the palm of your hand.

01:02:23.009 --> 01:02:26.679
Oh, come on, There's loads of them
waiting to get their mitts on your tits.

01:02:26.801 --> 01:02:29.721
I don't want any of them.
I only want Peter.

01:02:29.842 --> 01:02:32.632
- Well, he's not here, is he?
- Don't you think I know that?

01:02:33.884 --> 01:02:35.764
Oh, Teresa, what's wrong with me?

01:02:35.884 --> 01:02:38.014
I wish I could either have him
or forget him.

01:02:38.134 --> 01:02:40.384
I love him and it's tearing me apart.

01:02:40.509 --> 01:02:44.129
You should have given him a going-over
when you had your chance.

01:02:44.259 --> 01:02:45.589
Is that all you can say to me?

01:02:45.717 --> 01:02:48.257
I should have fucked him
when I had the chance?

01:02:48.384 --> 01:02:50.344
Sorry, Elaine. I didn't mean it like that.

01:02:50.467 --> 01:02:52.127
Me and my mouth.

01:02:54.801 --> 01:02:57.471
- They're stopping his mail.
- How do you know?

01:02:57.592 --> 01:03:00.342
He said it might happen
in one of his letters.

01:03:00.467 --> 01:03:03.257
There just isn't anyone,
not anyone that can help me.

01:03:03.384 --> 01:03:05.724
But I'm not giving up, Teresa. I'm not.

01:03:05.842 --> 01:03:09.302
You might have no option.
I'm only trying to be realistic.

01:03:10.842 --> 01:03:13.472
- Have you tried the British embassy?
- Weeks ago.

01:03:13.592 --> 01:03:15.802
- And what?
- They're not interested.

01:03:15.926 --> 01:03:18.126
God, they're all the same, aren't they?

01:03:20.176 --> 01:03:22.176
Give us a go of that.

01:03:22.301 --> 01:03:25.631
Do you know what I'd do?
I'd get a gorgeous photo of myself,

01:03:25.759 --> 01:03:28.799
lash it in an envelope
and write a dead nice letter to that fella.

01:03:28.926 --> 01:03:30.626
- Vinnie, what's his name?
- Who?

01:03:30.759 --> 01:03:32.339
The president of Russia.

01:03:32.467 --> 01:03:34.547
- Brezhnev, isn't it?
- That's it, Brezhnev.

01:03:35.134 --> 01:03:38.684
Teresa, you mount!
Why didn't I think of that?

01:03:38.801 --> 01:03:40.931
- Oh, I love you.
- Where are you going?

01:03:41.051 --> 01:03:42.471
To write a letter to Brezhnev.

01:03:42.592 --> 01:03:46.802
You get in there and get your tits rubbed.
In fact, why not get them pulled off you?

01:03:47.592 --> 01:03:50.222
- Where's she going?
- Oh, never mind!

01:03:53.676 --> 01:03:55.966
'I just need to be with Peter again.

01:03:56.092 --> 01:03:58.432
'He loves me and I deeply love him.

01:03:58.551 --> 01:04:00.471
'You're my last and only hope.

01:04:00.592 --> 01:04:05.052
'The British authorities won't help me
so I leave my heart in your hands.

01:04:05.176 --> 01:04:08.796
'I ask only to see him again and offer you
the hand of friendship and sincerity

01:04:08.926 --> 01:04:11.126
'from an ordinary Kirkby girl.

01:04:11.259 --> 01:04:13.089
'Yours hopefully, Elaine Spencer.'

01:04:16.217 --> 01:04:19.377
Yeah, but they're always dying,
them Russian presidents.

01:04:19.509 --> 01:04:23.839
- I'm sure he's dead.
- Shut up, Josie. You don't know that.

01:04:23.967 --> 01:04:25.547
God, I hope he understands.

01:04:25.676 --> 01:04:28.716
Mind you, he probably gets
letters like this all the time.

01:04:31.092 --> 01:04:33.882
- Hiya, Elaine, Josie.
- Oh, hiya, Tracy.

01:04:34.009 --> 01:04:35.879
I haven't seen you for ages. How are you?

01:04:36.009 --> 01:04:37.549
I'm all right. How are you?

01:04:37.676 --> 01:04:39.626
Oh, I'm smashing. I'm doing really well.

01:04:39.759 --> 01:04:41.799
- Have you been to cash your giro yet?
- No.

01:04:41.926 --> 01:04:44.046
- Oh, I have.
- I thought you were working.

01:04:44.176 --> 01:04:47.006
I was but they made us all redundant
about six weeks ago.

01:04:47.134 --> 01:04:48.684
Mind you, I'm not that bothered.

01:04:48.801 --> 01:04:50.801
Gives me more time
to do the things I want.

01:04:50.926 --> 01:04:53.966
- Are you still seeing Mick?
- Um, no.

01:04:54.092 --> 01:04:56.512
We finished just after I got
my redundancy pay

01:04:56.634 --> 01:04:59.514
I wouldn't mind,
but I spent most of it on him. Bastard!

01:04:59.634 --> 01:05:01.594
He's going with that one at the Birds Eye.

01:05:01.717 --> 01:05:03.507
- Is he?
- Mm.

01:05:03.634 --> 01:05:05.934
- What's that you're posting?
- Oh, just a letter.

01:05:06.051 --> 01:05:08.881
- Who are you writing to?
- The president of the Soviet Union.

01:05:09.009 --> 01:05:10.469
What?

01:05:10.592 --> 01:05:14.132
Anyway, Tracy, I'm in a bit of a rush
so I'll be seeing you.

01:05:14.259 --> 01:05:15.379
Shush, you.

01:05:22.134 --> 01:05:24.634
Hang on, Elaine. Spill the beans, then.

01:05:24.759 --> 01:05:27.089
What beans? There's no beans to spill.

01:05:27.217 --> 01:05:31.047
You're writing letters to the Soviet Union
and there's no beans to spill?

01:05:31.176 --> 01:05:33.176
Oh, tell us. I won't say anything.

01:05:33.301 --> 01:05:35.341
If you must know, I'm engaged to a Russian

01:05:35.467 --> 01:05:39.007
and they won't let him leave the country
so I've written to the president.

01:05:39.134 --> 01:05:42.264
Oh, get away, you liar.
You've been reading Mills & Boon.

01:05:42.384 --> 01:05:45.764
She's not a liar. She is going
with a Russian and his name's Peter.

01:05:45.884 --> 01:05:47.554
And I've seen a photograph of him.

01:05:47.676 --> 01:05:50.926
- Well, where's the ring, then?
- They don't give rings in Russia.

01:05:51.926 --> 01:05:53.676
They give you these.

01:05:57.551 --> 01:06:00.721
Well, you won't get any joy out of him.
Russians are an ignorant lot.

01:06:00.842 --> 01:06:03.052
Dead cold, not interested in people,

01:06:03.176 --> 01:06:06.796
only in invading other countries
and depriving them of basic human rights.

01:06:06.926 --> 01:06:09.716
- Oh, yeah? And how would you know.
- I just know, don't I?

01:06:09.842 --> 01:06:13.932
It's common knowledge, isn't it?
Anyway, I used to go out with a Russian.

01:06:14.051 --> 01:06:16.051
- Did you?
- Yeah, his name was Vladimir.

01:06:16.176 --> 01:06:17.756
So I do know what they're like.

01:06:17.884 --> 01:06:21.094
If you've been to the moon
you've been there twice, haven't you?

01:06:21.217 --> 01:06:23.177
You just don't see any good in people.

01:06:23.301 --> 01:06:26.431
- Not in communist Russians I don't.
- You jealous bastard.

01:06:27.384 --> 01:06:30.224
- Who do you think you're talking to?
- You.

01:06:30.342 --> 01:06:33.092
Do you wanna know something?
I've never liked you.

01:06:33.217 --> 01:06:36.297
You're miserable, petty,
and you don't like to see people get on.

01:06:36.426 --> 01:06:37.876
Oh, look who's talking.

01:06:38.009 --> 01:06:40.299
I only put up with you
cos I felt sorry for you.

01:06:40.426 --> 01:06:43.876
If it wasn't for me you'd have spent
many a night sitting in, bored.

01:06:44.009 --> 01:06:45.219
Would I?

01:06:45.342 --> 01:06:48.052
Anyway, as I said, Tracy,
I've got to get going.

01:06:48.176 --> 01:06:51.506
Why don't you go and get a job
and maybe Mick will take you back,

01:06:51.634 --> 01:06:53.724
if you beg him.

01:06:53.842 --> 01:06:56.722
Well, I'd rather have him
than some scabby Russian.

01:07:01.009 --> 01:07:02.879
Do you remember that night in the Woody

01:07:03.009 --> 01:07:05.219
when you thought
that girl was shagging Mick?

01:07:05.342 --> 01:07:07.052
Well, she wasn't cos I was.

01:07:07.176 --> 01:07:09.966
And do you wanna know something else?
He was useless.

01:07:10.092 --> 01:07:11.972
I'd rather sit on my finger.

01:07:15.967 --> 01:07:18.257
Elaine, you didn't, did you?

01:07:18.384 --> 01:07:21.094
- Didn't what?
- What you said to Tracy about.

01:07:21.217 --> 01:07:24.047
- Well, you know.
- Josie, what do you think?

01:07:24.176 --> 01:07:25.376
Oh, no.

01:09:45.634 --> 01:09:46.764
Mum!

01:09:47.801 --> 01:09:51.341
I'm not letting you go, Elaine,
so you might as well get used to the idea.

01:09:51.466 --> 01:09:53.966
I mean, who do you know
that's ever been there?

01:09:54.091 --> 01:09:55.632
- No one.
- Who?

01:09:55.759 --> 01:09:56.879
I said no one.

01:09:57.009 --> 01:09:59.259
Then why do you have
to be Little Miss Different?

01:09:59.384 --> 01:10:01.634
I've told you why.
I've told the both of yous.

01:10:01.759 --> 01:10:04.009
- Because Peter's there.
- Peter!

01:10:04.134 --> 01:10:07.884
Who the fuck is this Peter anyway?
I mean, we haven't even met him yet.

01:10:08.009 --> 01:10:10.089
He's the man I love,
the man I'm gonna marry.

01:10:10.217 --> 01:10:13.757
If being with him means living in Russia,
then that's the way it's gonna be.

01:10:13.884 --> 01:10:15.514
Holy Jesus.

01:10:16.301 --> 01:10:17.881
Do you know why no one goes there?

01:10:18.009 --> 01:10:19.839
Because people like you and the press,

01:10:19.967 --> 01:10:23.257
who know fuck all about the place,
encourage us not to.

01:10:23.384 --> 01:10:26.684
You think you know everything.
Let me tell you something, madam.

01:10:26.801 --> 01:10:28.591
I'm not having you preaching to me.

01:10:28.717 --> 01:10:30.717
You're only 22 years of age

01:10:30.842 --> 01:10:32.472
and you know fuck all,

01:10:32.592 --> 01:10:35.472
so get it into your head right now
that you're staying here.

01:10:35.592 --> 01:10:38.012
- OK?
- See that and that?

01:10:38.134 --> 01:10:40.014
These are my tickets for freedom.

01:10:40.134 --> 01:10:42.884
These say I can get on a plane,
get out of here and leave.

01:10:43.009 --> 01:10:45.429
These say I can leave. Why can't you?

01:10:45.551 --> 01:10:47.761
I've never put my foot down with you, girl.

01:10:47.884 --> 01:10:50.594
Mum, I don't care what you say
or how you try to bully me.

01:10:50.717 --> 01:10:53.587
My mind's made up.
I'm going and that's that.

01:10:55.384 --> 01:10:59.344
So why don't you just get your wool out
and knit yourself an iron curtain?

01:11:02.676 --> 01:11:05.756
'On a happier note,
Elaine Spencer, a Kirkby girl

01:11:05.884 --> 01:11:08.184
'and a former pupil of St Gregory's school

01:11:08.301 --> 01:11:10.131
'is on her way to Russia.

01:11:10.259 --> 01:11:12.469
'Elaine, who fell in love
with a Russian sailor

01:11:12.592 --> 01:11:15.342
'while spending an evening
in Liverpool's State Ballroom

01:11:15.467 --> 01:11:19.047
'is convinced her future will be desolate
without her new-found love...'

01:11:20.051 --> 01:11:22.051
- She'll only be round there.
- All right.

01:11:24.717 --> 01:11:26.337
Elaine Spencer?

01:11:28.842 --> 01:11:31.842
- You are Elaine Spencer?
- Why? Who wants to know?

01:11:43.301 --> 01:11:45.841
- Hiya, Josie. Where's Elaine?
- Oh, hiya.

01:11:45.967 --> 01:11:48.427
She won't be a minute.
She's just gone to get a loaf.

01:11:48.551 --> 01:11:50.381
Quick, get here.

01:11:50.509 --> 01:11:51.839
Open the bag.

01:11:55.426 --> 01:11:59.626
There's ten legs, four wings
and a couple of breasts.

01:11:59.759 --> 01:12:01.929
Tell your mother
I couldn't get the full bird.

01:12:02.051 --> 01:12:04.431
Oh, what are you like!

01:12:06.176 --> 01:12:08.256
So you're a communist, then?

01:12:08.384 --> 01:12:10.434
No, I'm a human being.

01:12:10.551 --> 01:12:14.131
Communists aren't exactly
flavour of the month in England, are they?

01:12:14.259 --> 01:12:17.969
- Hi, Elaine.
- Er, this is Teresa King.

01:12:18.092 --> 01:12:20.092
Ah, the other girl.

01:12:20.217 --> 01:12:22.547
Yeah, sorry.
What was the name again? King?

01:12:22.676 --> 01:12:23.926
With a K.

01:12:24.967 --> 01:12:26.927
And I'm her sister, Josie.

01:12:27.051 --> 01:12:30.971
I didn't meet him but I read his letters
and saw his photograph, so...

01:12:31.092 --> 01:12:34.472
If you wanna take a few pictures of me,
just help yourself.

01:12:34.592 --> 01:12:36.222
Josie.

01:12:36.342 --> 01:12:39.432
So, what did Peter think
of your political views, then?

01:12:39.551 --> 01:12:42.181
Or were you too busy with other things?

01:12:42.301 --> 01:12:43.471
Like what?

01:12:43.592 --> 01:12:48.052
Oh, come on. You're in love with him
so did you... make love?

01:12:48.176 --> 01:12:50.256
Yes, we did.

01:12:50.384 --> 01:12:51.684
In our own way.

01:12:52.509 --> 01:12:57.719
Er, you go out with sailors,
don't you, you and your friend?

01:12:57.842 --> 01:13:02.302
Attractive girls so there can't be
any shortage of boyfriends.

01:13:02.426 --> 01:13:04.796
Look, lad, what are you getting at?

01:13:04.926 --> 01:13:05.926
The truth.

01:13:06.051 --> 01:13:09.931
The truth is there was no filth or smut.
We love each other.

01:13:10.884 --> 01:13:12.634
Yeah, I'm sure.

01:13:12.759 --> 01:13:16.879
But if you want me to make something up,
something to titillate your readers,

01:13:17.009 --> 01:13:18.839
something cheap and kinky...

01:13:19.426 --> 01:13:23.006
Listen, I think
your whole story is kinky, dear.

01:13:23.134 --> 01:13:25.184
Most people are trying
to get out of Russia.

01:13:25.301 --> 01:13:27.971
Why do you think
they sent you that invitation?

01:13:29.301 --> 01:13:31.881
I don't know. I just wrote
and explained my situation.

01:13:32.009 --> 01:13:33.179
And do you honestly think

01:13:33.301 --> 01:13:35.681
that the president of the Soviet Union

01:13:35.801 --> 01:13:39.301
could possibly be interested
in your dilemma?

01:13:39.426 --> 01:13:42.426
No, I don't,
but at least he did write back to me

01:13:42.551 --> 01:13:44.011
and send me a plane ticket,

01:13:44.134 --> 01:13:46.724
which is more
than the British embassy did.

01:13:46.842 --> 01:13:49.132
Yes, I understand that, but...

01:13:50.426 --> 01:13:53.006
surely it must make you feel
a bit strange,

01:13:53.134 --> 01:13:55.594
leaving your home.

01:13:55.717 --> 01:13:57.757
Your surroundings,

01:13:57.884 --> 01:14:02.344
going to a country with food shortages
and a lack of freedom.

01:14:02.467 --> 01:14:04.257
Why, been there, have you?

01:14:04.384 --> 01:14:07.934
No, I haven't been there, no.

01:14:08.051 --> 01:14:11.091
Then how do you know about
the food shortages and lack of freedom?

01:14:11.217 --> 01:14:13.677
You just take a walk
into any back kitchen round here

01:14:13.801 --> 01:14:16.341
and you'll soon see food shortages.

01:14:16.467 --> 01:14:19.337
Going to live in Russia
can't be any worse than living here

01:14:19.467 --> 01:14:21.837
so why are you discouraging me
from escaping?

01:14:21.967 --> 01:14:25.337
Escape? You wait till you get there.

01:14:25.467 --> 01:14:29.797
You'll be desperate to get hold
of a bit of my filth and titillation.

01:14:29.926 --> 01:14:31.626
No, I won't.

01:14:31.759 --> 01:14:34.009
Well, I hope you're right, dear.

01:14:34.134 --> 01:14:35.384
I hope you're right.

01:14:36.342 --> 01:14:38.592
Aren't you gonna take any photographs?

01:14:38.717 --> 01:14:40.927
No, I've got everything I need, thanks.

01:14:43.592 --> 01:14:45.342
I'm dead photogenic, me, you know.

01:14:45.467 --> 01:14:47.217
I take lovely pictures, I do.

01:14:47.342 --> 01:14:50.342
People stop me in the street
and tell me how photogenic I am.

01:14:50.467 --> 01:14:51.467
Honestly.

01:14:55.884 --> 01:14:56.884
Bastard.

01:14:57.009 --> 01:14:58.379
What was he saying to you?

01:14:58.509 --> 01:15:01.719
He didn't really say anything.
He had it written down before he came.

01:15:01.842 --> 01:15:04.592
Wanted to know if me and Peter had...
Oh, you know.

01:15:04.717 --> 01:15:07.757
They wanna know the ins and outs
of a cat's arsehole, don't they?

01:15:07.884 --> 01:15:09.974
I still think he should
have took a picture.

01:15:10.092 --> 01:15:12.172
I mean, just look at me.

01:15:14.301 --> 01:15:16.511
We're only trying to be reasonable.

01:15:16.634 --> 01:15:20.184
It's Russia we're talking about,
not a week away in Beddgelert.

01:15:20.301 --> 01:15:24.131
You'd like that, seeing me
stuck here in Kirkby with no hope.

01:15:24.259 --> 01:15:27.339
Mum, I love him.
Can't you understand that?

01:15:27.467 --> 01:15:30.467
- You think you love him.
- I know I love him.

01:15:30.592 --> 01:15:32.432
Why aren't yous celebrating with me?

01:15:32.551 --> 01:15:36.051
They lock you up in labour camps,
if you speak against the system.

01:15:36.176 --> 01:15:39.586
It's true, they do.
They tap all the phones as well.

01:15:39.717 --> 01:15:41.587
What's wrong with everyone?

01:15:41.717 --> 01:15:43.967
I can't believe
what yous are saying to me.

01:15:44.092 --> 01:15:46.762
And you, who's been getting
down your earhole?

01:15:46.884 --> 01:15:49.594
You were all for it
when I was posting the letter.

01:15:49.717 --> 01:15:53.377
What's wrong? Are you scared
of being called pinkos or commie lovers?

01:15:53.509 --> 01:15:57.509
It's not that, love. We don't want you
to get into something you'll regret.

01:15:57.634 --> 01:16:00.054
If I stay here I'll live to regret it.

01:16:00.176 --> 01:16:03.086
We only want what's best for you, love.

01:16:03.217 --> 01:16:05.337
Then make it easy for me and let me go.

01:16:18.926 --> 01:16:22.466
- You're quite a celebrity.
- Not really, no.

01:16:22.592 --> 01:16:26.802
You are. You've made front-page news.
That's quite an achievement.

01:16:26.926 --> 01:16:30.006
- Why am I here?
- Just for a little chat.

01:16:30.634 --> 01:16:32.474
I'm here to help you if I can.

01:16:32.592 --> 01:16:35.472
Now, what I'd like to do is
to relax and get to know you a little.

01:16:35.592 --> 01:16:38.132
- Perhaps you'd like a drink.
- No, thanks. I'm fine.

01:16:38.259 --> 01:16:40.129
- Do you mind if I have one?
- No.

01:16:43.384 --> 01:16:47.344
Tell me, Elaine, do you know anyone
who's been to Russia?

01:16:47.467 --> 01:16:48.627
No.

01:16:50.259 --> 01:16:52.719
Well, I've been.
I was posted there for three years.

01:16:53.884 --> 01:16:56.594
It's a wonderful country.
Marvellous people.

01:16:56.717 --> 01:16:59.127
- Can you speak Russian, then?
- Da.

01:17:03.092 --> 01:17:05.052
I managed to pick up just a little.

01:17:07.634 --> 01:17:13.014
So, er, what do your parents think
about your impending trip?

01:17:14.009 --> 01:17:15.549
They don't want me to go.

01:17:15.676 --> 01:17:18.216
- Do you know why?
- Well, yeah. Cos it's Russia.

01:17:18.342 --> 01:17:20.932
And I can understand how they feel.

01:17:21.051 --> 01:17:23.341
- But I love him.
- Well, of course you do.

01:17:23.467 --> 01:17:26.757
And it's that that makes it
all the more difficult, isn't it?

01:17:26.884 --> 01:17:30.724
You say that you can understand
how they feel?

01:17:31.676 --> 01:17:34.426
Well, we're not exactly encouraged
to go there, are we?

01:17:35.259 --> 01:17:39.759
Well, I'm not so sure about that.
One thing is certain.

01:17:39.884 --> 01:17:42.804
If one of our people decides
they wish to go to Russia,

01:17:42.926 --> 01:17:46.716
there will be nobody to point the finger
and say, "No, you can't go".

01:17:46.842 --> 01:17:50.632
That is the fundamental difference
between our system and theirs.

01:17:50.759 --> 01:17:54.219
Here in the West
we encourage individualism

01:17:54.342 --> 01:17:55.972
and freedom.

01:17:56.092 --> 01:17:57.802
Whereas in Russia, as you know,

01:17:57.926 --> 01:18:01.966
a more suppressive system is in operation.

01:18:03.217 --> 01:18:06.717
So you can't blame your parents
for being upset.

01:18:06.842 --> 01:18:08.802
And they can't blame me for being in love.

01:18:08.926 --> 01:18:11.006
No, no, no. Of course not.

01:18:11.134 --> 01:18:15.134
Love is a very important emotion.

01:18:15.967 --> 01:18:20.217
But I think it's very important
that I make one or two things clear to you

01:18:20.342 --> 01:18:24.092
and try to discuss this matter with you

01:18:24.217 --> 01:18:26.627
without becoming emotional.

01:18:26.759 --> 01:18:30.549
Now, let's imagine
that you are now living in Russia.

01:18:30.676 --> 01:18:32.586
What difficulties are you going to have?

01:18:32.717 --> 01:18:35.257
You have no knowledge
of the language or the money.

01:18:35.384 --> 01:18:38.554
You're not at all acquainted
with their customs or culture.

01:18:38.676 --> 01:18:42.426
But the biggest obstacle
which you will have to overcome

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:45.261
is that Westerners,
even if they are married to Soviets,

01:18:45.384 --> 01:18:48.184
are feared and despised.

01:18:48.301 --> 01:18:50.801
- Yeah, but I'll be with...
- No, no, let me finish.

01:18:50.926 --> 01:18:54.546
If you go to Russia, if you marry
and if you become a Soviet citizen,

01:18:54.676 --> 01:18:57.086
from the moment that you sign the form

01:18:57.217 --> 01:18:59.677
which makes you eligible
for Soviet citizenship

01:19:01.717 --> 01:19:05.967
it is unlikely from that time onwards
that you will be allowed to leave Russia.

01:19:08.009 --> 01:19:11.049
You must understand
that you must give up everything.

01:19:12.009 --> 01:19:13.879
I haven't got anything to give up.

01:19:14.009 --> 01:19:16.929
But you have. You have your youth.

01:19:17.051 --> 01:19:18.761
You have your beauty.

01:19:18.884 --> 01:19:20.554
You have your freedom.

01:19:21.634 --> 01:19:22.804
Hm?

01:19:24.092 --> 01:19:26.132
Now, let's try and look at it another way.

01:19:27.009 --> 01:19:29.009
- You want to settle down, don't you?
- Yes.

01:19:29.134 --> 01:19:30.884
You want to marry and have children.

01:19:31.009 --> 01:19:32.339
Yes.

01:19:32.467 --> 01:19:34.177
Then please, Elaine, wake up.

01:19:36.176 --> 01:19:37.716
If you go,

01:19:37.842 --> 01:19:40.092
you're heading for disaster.

01:19:44.842 --> 01:19:48.882
I'm a family man myself.
I have a son. I have two daughters.

01:19:49.009 --> 01:19:52.379
My oldest girl, Fiona,
is round about the same age as you,

01:19:52.509 --> 01:19:55.629
which is perhaps why I feel
so passionately about this.

01:19:56.551 --> 01:20:01.591
I feel that you must be told everything
so that you can be protected.

01:20:01.717 --> 01:20:03.047
Look, I know all that.

01:20:03.176 --> 01:20:05.256
And you've been dead nice.

01:20:05.384 --> 01:20:08.634
But I'm sorry, I've got a ticket
off the president of Russia,

01:20:08.759 --> 01:20:11.129
one of the most important men
in the world.

01:20:11.259 --> 01:20:14.549
I'm not afraid of what's round the corner.
I love him.

01:20:14.676 --> 01:20:18.466
And it's not a holiday romance.
He loves me. I know he does.

01:20:19.217 --> 01:20:21.177
No matter what you think,

01:20:21.301 --> 01:20:24.261
people are very concerned
about your welfare.

01:20:24.384 --> 01:20:28.264
Your parents, your friends
and we are concerned.

01:20:28.384 --> 01:20:29.934
Now, believe me,

01:20:30.051 --> 01:20:33.131
it's not an agreeable thing
trying to dissuade people

01:20:33.259 --> 01:20:36.009
from doing things
that they feel are right for them.

01:20:36.967 --> 01:20:40.377
You must understand that we have a duty
to protect our citizens.

01:20:40.509 --> 01:20:42.219
I understand.

01:20:42.342 --> 01:20:44.262
No, I don't think you do.

01:20:54.342 --> 01:20:56.182
This is a picture of Peter, yes?

01:20:59.842 --> 01:21:00.972
Yes.

01:21:06.509 --> 01:21:09.429
This is a picture of Peter and his wife.

01:21:11.634 --> 01:21:12.634
His what?

01:21:17.842 --> 01:21:19.052
I'm very sorry.

01:22:33.259 --> 01:22:37.589
What's it like here? One table selling pot,
the other table selling knock-off.

01:22:37.717 --> 01:22:41.967
- I'm not going to Russia.
- What do you mean, you're not going?

01:22:42.092 --> 01:22:44.932
- I'm just not.
- Why?

01:22:45.051 --> 01:22:48.051
- No one wants me to go.
- Like who?

01:22:48.176 --> 01:22:50.676
My mam, my dad, our Josie.

01:22:50.801 --> 01:22:53.301
So what? Sod them.
That's why you're going, isn't it?

01:22:53.426 --> 01:22:55.546
To get away from all this.

01:22:55.676 --> 01:22:58.216
Look, Elaine,
I don't want you to go either.

01:22:58.342 --> 01:23:00.432
You're my best friend,
my copping-off mate.

01:23:00.551 --> 01:23:02.631
But if this is your only chance
to get away,

01:23:02.759 --> 01:23:04.549
I'll be the first to encourage it.

01:23:04.676 --> 01:23:06.716
I know you would and you have.

01:23:08.009 --> 01:23:09.929
He's married.

01:23:10.051 --> 01:23:13.971
Peter? I don't believe it.
I just don't believe it.

01:23:14.092 --> 01:23:15.882
It's true.

01:23:16.009 --> 01:23:19.299
Hang on. Who dropped this little egg?

01:23:19.426 --> 01:23:21.586
You know that fella
from the Foreign Office?

01:23:21.717 --> 01:23:22.547
Yeah.

01:23:22.676 --> 01:23:24.506
Well, he had a photograph of Peter

01:23:25.634 --> 01:23:27.384
and his wife.

01:23:27.509 --> 01:23:30.259
- He said it was his wife.
- What difference does it make?

01:23:30.384 --> 01:23:31.724
A lot.

01:23:31.842 --> 01:23:33.972
The sneaky, sly bastard.

01:23:34.092 --> 01:23:36.592
You know before he showed you
the picture of the wife,

01:23:36.717 --> 01:23:38.217
did he try to stop you from going?

01:23:38.342 --> 01:23:40.012
- Yeah.
- And it didn't work, did it?

01:23:40.134 --> 01:23:42.384
- No.
- So he pulls out a picture of this woman,

01:23:42.509 --> 01:23:45.509
says it's Peter's old girl,
and that worked, didn't it?

01:23:45.634 --> 01:23:48.224
- He's not married, Elaine.
- He is.

01:23:48.342 --> 01:23:50.182
And I'm telling you he's not.

01:23:50.301 --> 01:23:53.131
Listen, I've had
the knickers dragged off me

01:23:53.259 --> 01:23:55.549
by more married men
than you've had hot dinners.

01:23:55.676 --> 01:23:57.586
I can spot them a mile off.

01:23:57.717 --> 01:24:02.127
If I've learnt one thing, it's this.
They don't just hold your hand all night.

01:24:02.259 --> 01:24:05.259
The knickers are around your ankles
as soon as they look at you.

01:24:05.384 --> 01:24:07.764
And they don't give you solid-gold lockets

01:24:07.884 --> 01:24:10.554
unless you've given them a good time.

01:24:10.676 --> 01:24:12.376
It's all propaganda and fear.

01:24:12.509 --> 01:24:14.759
They're trying to terrify you
into not going.

01:24:14.884 --> 01:24:18.884
He's married. I know he is.
I saw the photograph of her with him.

01:24:19.009 --> 01:24:21.629
He's married and I'm a fool
for falling in love with him.

01:24:21.759 --> 01:24:23.879
Elaine, I'm thick, as thick as that table,

01:24:24.009 --> 01:24:27.009
but there's one thing I've got
a fucking degree in and that's men

01:24:27.134 --> 01:24:29.634
so believe me when I tell you
Peter isn't married.

01:24:29.759 --> 01:24:31.549
You're a divvy if you believe them.

01:24:31.676 --> 01:24:35.006
What are yous all getting on at me for?
He's married, he's not married.

01:24:35.134 --> 01:24:37.934
You can go, you can't go.
You love him, you don't love him.

01:24:38.051 --> 01:24:41.091
I wish everybody would leave me alone
cos I'm going off my head.

01:24:41.217 --> 01:24:42.967
So be strong and see it through.

01:24:43.092 --> 01:24:46.382
Will you stop pushing me?
Just stop pushing me.

01:24:46.509 --> 01:24:49.089
- Come on, Elaine.
- Don't, Teresa. Just don't.

01:24:49.217 --> 01:24:52.257
He's married, married, married,
so will you just leave me alone?

01:24:52.384 --> 01:24:54.304
No, I won't leave you alone.

01:24:54.426 --> 01:24:58.216
All right, he's married,
but you've got a ticket there, haven't you?

01:24:58.342 --> 01:25:02.262
Get over there and find out for yourself
instead of taking some prick's word for it.

01:25:03.259 --> 01:25:05.259
Well, what have you got to lose?

01:25:12.301 --> 01:25:15.511
<i># Always something there to remind me</i>

01:25:17.051 --> 01:25:20.801
<i># I was born to love you</i>

01:25:20.926 --> 01:25:23.506
<i># And I will never be free</i>

01:25:23.634 --> 01:25:27.684
<i># When there is always
something there to remind me</i>

01:25:29.926 --> 01:25:32.546
<i># Always something there to remind me #</i>

01:25:32.676 --> 01:25:34.676
Come back to ours. Go on.

01:25:34.801 --> 01:25:36.841
- Go home with you?
- Yeah. Why not?

01:25:36.967 --> 01:25:38.587
No complaints the last time.

01:25:38.717 --> 01:25:41.257
Well, that was before
I found out you had a sweaty arse.

01:25:41.384 --> 01:25:42.634
Now, go on, move it,

01:25:42.759 --> 01:25:44.429
before I cuff the face off you.

01:25:46.592 --> 01:25:47.802
Well, go on.

01:25:47.926 --> 01:25:49.756
You bitch.

01:25:55.301 --> 01:25:57.971
- I got you this.
- What's that?

01:25:58.092 --> 01:25:59.092
Vodka.

01:26:24.051 --> 01:26:27.011
She just won't let go.
Well, not without a fight.

01:26:27.134 --> 01:26:28.764
My mother's like that.

01:26:28.884 --> 01:26:32.304
She'll be over there interfering
before you know it.

01:26:32.426 --> 01:26:36.216
God, I didn't know what to say.
She looked awful upset.

01:26:37.801 --> 01:26:40.801
Elaine! Elaine! Here, take this.

01:26:40.926 --> 01:26:44.126
- Oh, Mum!
- Listen, you'll be freezing over there.

01:26:44.259 --> 01:26:47.339
Anyway, I don't want his lot
to think you come from a bad home.

01:26:47.467 --> 01:26:50.837
- Oh, Mum.
- Go on, get going. You'll miss your plane.

01:26:50.967 --> 01:26:52.677
See you, Elaine.

01:26:52.801 --> 01:26:53.801
Ta-ra.

01:27:07.926 --> 01:27:09.546
'Have your nerves gone?'

01:27:09.676 --> 01:27:12.296
Not really.
I thought I'd be more nervous than this.

01:27:12.426 --> 01:27:14.546
I've been looking
forward to it for so long

01:27:14.676 --> 01:27:17.046
it's a sort of anti-climax now.

01:27:17.176 --> 01:27:20.086
Mind you, my bottle's gonna go
when I see Peter.

01:27:20.217 --> 01:27:22.047
I wish I was going.

01:27:22.176 --> 01:27:24.676
You could have gone
if you'd put your mind to it.

01:27:24.801 --> 01:27:26.971
No, it just doesn't happen
to people like me.

01:27:27.092 --> 01:27:30.762
You're dead lucky, Elaine,
but I'm made up for you, honest.

01:27:30.884 --> 01:27:34.134
It's got nothing to do with luck.
I just had a dream, that's all.

01:27:34.259 --> 01:27:37.549
I made it all happen myself,
but that's what it's all about.

01:27:38.842 --> 01:27:41.382
You can have your dream, Teresa.
Just go out and get it.

01:27:41.509 --> 01:27:44.339
You're lovely and you're wasting your time
stuck in Kirkby.

01:27:44.467 --> 01:27:47.377
You could have anyone you wanted
if you put your mind to it.

01:27:47.509 --> 01:27:50.379
Oh, come on, Teresa. What do you dream of?

01:27:50.509 --> 01:27:53.879
Drinking vodka, getting fucked
and stuffing chickens.

01:27:54.009 --> 01:27:57.089
That's it. That's my dream.

01:27:57.217 --> 01:28:00.797
Do you remember that night in the hotel
when you said you wasn't like me,

01:28:00.926 --> 01:28:03.046
you're just a straight Kirkby girl?

01:28:03.176 --> 01:28:06.756
Well, you're not, are you?
The straight ones get left behind.

01:28:06.884 --> 01:28:08.434
But they don't have to.

01:28:08.551 --> 01:28:10.681
Nothing's stopping you from fucking off.

01:28:10.801 --> 01:28:12.091
I am.

01:28:12.217 --> 01:28:14.177
I'm stopping me, Elaine.

01:28:14.301 --> 01:28:16.841
I'm frightened of what's round the corner.

01:28:16.967 --> 01:28:20.087
I'm not the big funny girl
everyone thinks, you know.

01:28:20.217 --> 01:28:22.087
Big soft-arse really.

01:28:22.926 --> 01:28:25.626
Well, I won't tell your secret to anyone.

01:28:25.759 --> 01:28:27.339
Anyway, what does it matter?

01:28:27.467 --> 01:28:31.717
'Will all passengers flying
to Moscow on Flight 3170

01:28:31.842 --> 01:28:33.972
'please make their way to Gate A.

01:28:34.092 --> 01:28:35.512
'Thank you.'

01:28:35.634 --> 01:28:38.344
Well, that's me. I'd better get going.

01:28:38.467 --> 01:28:41.377
I'll write as soon as I get there
and tell you what it's like.

01:28:41.509 --> 01:28:45.469
You better had or I'll get over there
and glawn the face off you.

01:28:45.592 --> 01:28:48.432
I will, honest. I'll get off, then.

01:28:48.551 --> 01:28:50.131
Elaine, look after yourself.

01:28:51.384 --> 01:28:53.094
I won't half miss you.

01:28:53.217 --> 01:28:54.627
And I'll miss you as well.

01:29:03.176 --> 01:29:05.426
Don't forget to write.

01:29:05.551 --> 01:29:06.801
I won't.

01:29:13.717 --> 01:29:17.717
Oh, Teresa, if it hadn't been for you
none of this would have happened.

01:29:17.842 --> 01:29:20.842
And do you wanna know something?
You're right, I am lucky.

01:30:09.384 --> 01:30:11.264
Tell Igor I love him.

01:30:22.717 --> 01:30:26.217
<i># He was on the dancefloor</i>

01:30:26.342 --> 01:30:30.472

01:31:08.592 --> 01:31:11.972

your signal would fade</i>

01:31:12.092 --> 01:31:15.182

01:31:42.467 --> 01:31:45.217
