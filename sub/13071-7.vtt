00:00.968 --> 00:02.236
* Previously on BrainDead... *

00:38.239 --> 00:40.074
(indistinct chatter)

00:40.108 --> 00:42.076
I'm Laurel Healy.

00:42.110 --> 00:43.811
And...

00:43.844 --> 00:46.414
I think I'm going insane.

00:46.447 --> 00:49.283
GARETH:
Hmm.

00:49.317 --> 00:52.420
Well, if we're being honest,
why "insane"?

00:52.453 --> 00:54.688
Because I think bugs
are eating people's brains

00:54.722 --> 00:56.424
and turning them stupid.

00:56.457 --> 00:58.292
(laughs)

00:58.326 --> 01:00.328
(quietly):
Yeah, well.

01:12.273 --> 01:13.874
Huh.

01:13.907 --> 01:16.144
That's not what I'd
thought you'd say.

01:16.177 --> 01:18.546
Yeah, me, either.

01:18.579 --> 01:21.549
That's why I asked if you saw
anything coming out of my ear

01:21.582 --> 01:22.516
the other night.
I'm--

01:22.550 --> 01:23.684
From your migraine?

01:23.717 --> 01:24.885
Yes.
No!

01:24.918 --> 01:26.220
I don't get migraines.

01:26.254 --> 01:28.122
I just said that
so I wouldn't sound crazy.

01:28.156 --> 01:29.723
As opposed to now.

01:29.757 --> 01:30.758
Yes.

01:30.791 --> 01:32.493
Mm-hmm, okay.

01:32.526 --> 01:35.896
So, you've seen bugs?

01:35.929 --> 01:37.598
Yeah.

01:37.631 --> 01:40.568
They-they tend to cluster
around cherry blossoms.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.470
How patriotic.

01:42.503 --> 01:44.638
(laughs)
I'm sorry.

01:44.672 --> 01:46.140
No, no, it should be
made fun of.

01:46.174 --> 01:47.508
It's-it's crazy.

01:49.510 --> 01:51.345
Why are you telling me this?

01:51.379 --> 01:52.646
I don't know.

01:52.680 --> 01:55.549
It's not smart, I...

01:55.583 --> 01:58.219
To be honest, I, um...

02:02.590 --> 02:04.725
See those people
over there?

02:06.194 --> 02:07.495
Mm-hmm.

02:07.528 --> 02:09.363
They're watching us.

02:09.397 --> 02:11.565
Because they have bugs?

02:11.599 --> 02:14.202
I'm just trying
to connect the dots here.

02:14.235 --> 02:15.536
Okay, he's listening
to his ear buds, right?

02:15.569 --> 02:16.570
Mm-hmm.

02:16.604 --> 02:17.638
How much
you want to bet

02:17.671 --> 02:18.906
he's listening
to "You Might Think"

02:18.939 --> 02:20.341
by The Cars?

02:20.374 --> 02:21.742
More with The Cars.

02:21.775 --> 02:24.678
(sighs)

02:24.712 --> 02:26.880
Um, wait, you--

02:27.948 --> 02:29.217
Hey.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.284
How you doing?

02:30.318 --> 02:31.385
Good, you?

02:31.419 --> 02:32.586
What music
are you listening to?

02:32.620 --> 02:33.654
Excuse me?
Laurel,

02:33.687 --> 02:34.922
why don't we just--?
Hey!

02:34.955 --> 02:37.358
* Think it's foolish...
You like The Cars?

02:37.391 --> 02:39.227
I like to be left alone.
So do I.

02:39.260 --> 02:40.861
Stop watching me.

02:42.630 --> 02:43.697
Well?

02:43.731 --> 02:44.832
Good guess.

02:44.865 --> 02:45.899
Listen everywhere you go.

02:45.933 --> 02:47.235
You'll hear it.

02:47.268 --> 02:48.302
And what does that mean?

02:48.336 --> 02:49.570
They like the bass line.

02:49.603 --> 02:50.471
The bugs do?

02:50.504 --> 02:51.472
Yes.

02:51.505 --> 02:52.540
I love being patronized.

02:52.573 --> 02:53.574
Keep it up.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.376
(phone ringing)

02:55.409 --> 02:56.544
I'm sorry.

02:56.577 --> 02:58.646
I have to take this.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.314
Hello, Senator.

03:00.348 --> 03:01.482
Where are you, buddy?

03:01.515 --> 03:02.683
At drinks, sir.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.952
Yeah, with your friend Lana,
the bleeding heart liberal?

03:04.985 --> 03:06.620
Laurel.

03:06.654 --> 03:09.923
Well, I need some help
with these CHIs.

03:09.957 --> 03:13.727
You know, you're poor departed
predecessor Broadbent,

03:13.761 --> 03:15.329
his head exploded.

03:15.363 --> 03:17.331
Did you know that?
I did, sir.

03:17.365 --> 03:18.932
Why aren't the Feds
doing anything about it?

03:18.966 --> 03:20.334
What's wrong with them?

03:20.368 --> 03:21.335
I'll make some calls.

03:21.369 --> 03:22.703
I know you never
liked Broadbent.

03:22.736 --> 03:23.971
That's not true, sir.

03:24.004 --> 03:25.706
But I'd still like you
to do the best you can.

03:25.739 --> 03:27.975
And-and who's handling
my calls tonight?

03:28.008 --> 03:29.009
Mike.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.778
The intern.
Good.

03:30.811 --> 03:33.347
Tell Lana hi.

03:33.381 --> 03:34.415
Mike!

03:34.448 --> 03:35.983
Mike the intern!
Oh!

03:36.016 --> 03:37.751
(grunting)

03:37.785 --> 03:38.886
Uh, yes, Senator?

03:38.919 --> 03:40.588
It's okay.

03:40.621 --> 03:42.022
Just calm down.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.725
Get me Louie Marchant
on the line.

03:44.758 --> 03:45.526
All right?

03:45.559 --> 03:47.395
He'll know what
this is regarding?

03:47.428 --> 03:49.330
I'm a senator.

03:49.363 --> 03:50.998
He's the head of the FBI.

03:51.031 --> 03:52.766
Yeah, he'll know
what it's regarding.

03:56.704 --> 03:58.839
(sighs heavily)

04:19.960 --> 04:22.363
Help yourself.

04:24.832 --> 04:26.767
No?

04:26.800 --> 04:28.502
I have Director Marchant
on the line, Senator.

04:28.536 --> 04:30.304
Good, and get me some
of those cherry blossoms

04:30.338 --> 04:31.705
from the vases in there.

04:31.739 --> 04:33.541
Louie?

04:33.574 --> 04:36.009
What's going on
with these head explosions?

04:36.043 --> 04:38.646
Come on, I had
an employee who died

04:38.679 --> 04:40.481
from one of these--

04:40.514 --> 04:42.983
Well, have you considered
terrorism, sir?

04:43.016 --> 04:45.018
No, no, no.

04:45.052 --> 04:46.854
No, I'm just saying
we have enemies

04:46.887 --> 04:49.557
of the state, don't we?

04:49.590 --> 04:50.924
Uh-uh.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.627
No, well,

04:53.661 --> 04:55.363
I've heard you were--
No, I heard

04:55.396 --> 04:57.798
you were investigating
a Hill staffer up here

04:57.831 --> 04:59.833
who had access
to all the victims

04:59.867 --> 05:00.934
Lana something.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.903
Uh, Healy, wasn't it?

05:05.906 --> 05:08.676
There you go, little lady.

05:10.444 --> 05:12.012
(stammers)
Don't go yet.

05:12.045 --> 05:14.081
I need a favor.

05:14.114 --> 05:15.816
No, no, turn around.

05:15.849 --> 05:17.585
Turn around.

05:17.618 --> 05:19.753
I've been reading
the chatter, Louie.

05:19.787 --> 05:21.689
This could be bio-terrorism.

05:21.722 --> 05:23.457
The terrorists
have it out for me.

05:23.491 --> 05:24.758
Because of my stand.

05:24.792 --> 05:27.995
I'd bring in this Lana
for questioning.

05:33.434 --> 05:35.369
(chuckles)

05:36.670 --> 05:38.939
Look, Louie.

05:38.972 --> 05:40.808
Ask your friends
at CDC what happens

05:40.841 --> 05:42.109
when you're not responsive.

05:42.142 --> 05:43.777
One second.

05:43.811 --> 05:45.779
Mike? Mike the
intern, right?

05:45.813 --> 05:47.481
Yes, sir.

05:47.515 --> 05:49.950
You can, you can
turn around.

05:49.983 --> 05:51.919
What did you
study in school?

05:51.952 --> 05:53.787
Oh, in-in college?
Coding.

05:53.821 --> 05:54.822
"Coding,"
yeah?

05:54.855 --> 05:56.524
Good, good.

05:56.557 --> 05:57.591
Lean in.

05:57.625 --> 05:59.493
Nah...

05:59.527 --> 06:01.462
lean, lean your head.

06:01.495 --> 06:03.764
Oh.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.000
Good.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.002
Yeah, good.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.538
All right.

06:10.571 --> 06:12.906
Take these home tonight.

06:12.940 --> 06:15.008
And I'm gonna need you bright
and early tomorrow

06:15.042 --> 06:16.877
at the senate gym.

06:16.910 --> 06:20.080
You want me
at the senate gym?

06:20.113 --> 06:22.082
Yeah, 7:00 a.m.

06:22.115 --> 06:23.584
Don't be late.

06:27.488 --> 06:29.089
Louie, here's what I want.

06:29.122 --> 06:31.859
I want a report
by tomorrow morning.

06:31.892 --> 06:35.629
Meet me at the senate gym
at 7:00 a.m.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.902
Stupid bastard.

06:41.935 --> 06:44.638
Oh, come on, it isn't
terrorism, sir.
There is
no medical reason for this.

06:44.672 --> 06:45.906
The chatter doesn't
mean anything.
The terrorists keep

06:45.939 --> 06:47.307
telling us they're doing it,

06:47.340 --> 06:48.442
Islamic Ra'id takes credit
for everything.
we have to listen to it.

06:48.476 --> 06:50.644
Wait a minute, weren't
we standing here a month ago,

06:50.678 --> 06:51.879
and you were saying
it was terrorism

06:51.912 --> 06:53.213
and you were saying it wasn't?
Yes.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.882
I changed my mind.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.551
Ra'id doesn't know what
they're taking credit for.

06:57.585 --> 06:59.753
They read the news in The Post,
then just try to mirror it.

06:59.787 --> 07:01.054
Well, I got to give
this jack-ass senator

07:01.088 --> 07:02.155
a report tomorrow.

07:02.189 --> 07:05.926
Did we question
some Hill staffer Lana

07:05.959 --> 07:07.461
Healy?
Laurel Healy.

07:07.495 --> 07:08.996
Yes, sir.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.731
I think we should bring her in
for some more tough questioning.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.500
Are you insane?

07:12.533 --> 07:13.967
She's the sister of a senator.

07:14.001 --> 07:15.669
She is?

07:15.703 --> 07:17.938
God, okay.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.907
Let me handle Wheatus.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.909
These senators
love talking tough.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.677
Best not to enable them.

07:27.515 --> 07:29.983
Come on, pick it up,
you slow poke.

07:30.017 --> 07:31.819
Oh, God.

07:31.852 --> 07:33.521
You converts are the worst.

07:33.554 --> 07:35.589
It doesn't matter
if it's religion or exercise,

07:35.623 --> 07:36.824
everything is purity.

07:36.857 --> 07:37.825
(laughs)

07:37.858 --> 07:39.927
Have you met
my intern Mike?

07:39.960 --> 07:41.762
Good kid.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.063
Nice to meet you.

07:43.096 --> 07:46.534
So, are the terrorists
doing this, Louie?

07:46.567 --> 07:47.835
No, they aren't.

07:47.868 --> 07:50.203
Okay, let me tell you
what I'm hearing.

07:50.237 --> 07:53.073
The Islamic Ra-id Front
is taking credit

07:53.106 --> 07:55.743
for these head explosions
and they're promising

07:55.776 --> 07:59.012
a new one once a week
until the November elections.

07:59.046 --> 08:01.214
Yes, and last time they promised
a pandemic of head lice.

08:01.248 --> 08:04.952
They scan The Post,
and take credit for stories.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.587
I don't think you're
taking these head explosions

08:06.620 --> 08:08.522
seriously enough, Director.

08:08.556 --> 08:10.090
Come on, Mike, two more.

08:10.123 --> 08:11.659
You can do it.

08:11.692 --> 08:12.793
Come on.

08:12.826 --> 08:13.827
Where are you
hearing this, Red?

08:13.861 --> 08:14.928
Hearing what?

08:14.962 --> 08:16.229
About the terrorists
taking credit?

08:16.263 --> 08:18.999
Well, my chief of staff
is dating Lana Healy

08:19.032 --> 08:21.234
and she's supposedly
hooked in.

08:21.268 --> 08:22.069
Come on, Mike.

08:22.102 --> 08:23.671
I think you need
a little more weight.

08:23.704 --> 08:24.938
I'm gonna help you out.

08:24.972 --> 08:26.674
Okay, yeah.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.241
All right, now,
come on, dig down.

08:28.275 --> 08:30.711
All right, be the beast,
you got it.

08:30.744 --> 08:32.946
(grunting)

08:32.980 --> 08:35.082
My, my head hurts.
Red?

08:35.115 --> 08:36.717
I'm an analyst.

08:36.750 --> 08:37.985
You're a senator.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.720
I don't tell you
how to do your job.

08:39.753 --> 08:41.021
You don't tell me
how to do mine.

08:41.054 --> 08:42.956
Well, uh, the
only difference is

08:42.990 --> 08:45.893
that you don't hold
my purse strings.

08:45.926 --> 08:47.795
Come on.

08:47.828 --> 08:48.929
Just a few more inches.

08:48.962 --> 08:51.832
Three, two,

08:51.865 --> 08:53.801
one...
(groaning)

08:53.834 --> 08:55.836
Blast it!

09:09.382 --> 09:11.585
Mr. Cornish?

09:11.619 --> 09:13.286
Present.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.590
Oh.

09:16.624 --> 09:19.126
You didn't fill in all
the blanks, Mr. Cornish.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.728
How may I help you?

09:20.761 --> 09:22.730
Oh, that's
an interesting statue.

09:22.763 --> 09:23.731
Yes.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.232
I should probably get curtains.

09:25.265 --> 09:26.834
Do you know
who it is?

09:26.867 --> 09:27.735
Major Hancock, I think.

09:27.768 --> 09:32.105
Ah, Major General
Winfield Scott Hancock.

09:32.139 --> 09:34.007
Civil War buff?

09:34.041 --> 09:36.076
No, just trivia.

09:37.778 --> 09:39.747
Anyway...

09:39.780 --> 09:40.781
Where's that door go?

09:41.715 --> 09:43.851
To the hall-- why?

09:43.884 --> 09:45.653
Just wondering about
other ways out of the office

09:45.686 --> 09:47.120
that don't take me
through the reception.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.124
Okay.

09:51.158 --> 09:52.860
Anyway...

09:52.893 --> 09:55.095
I need you to stand, Laurel.

09:56.163 --> 09:57.698
You need me to stand?

09:57.731 --> 09:59.099
Yes.

09:59.132 --> 10:00.133
(chuckles)
Why?

10:00.167 --> 10:02.102
Eh, it's customary.

10:02.135 --> 10:04.672
For?

10:08.842 --> 10:10.978
What are those?

10:11.011 --> 10:12.312
Disposable
restraints.

10:12.345 --> 10:14.381
Uh, less obnoxious
than handcuffs.

10:16.216 --> 10:18.051
Why are you here?

10:18.085 --> 10:20.788
To take you in
for questioning.

10:20.821 --> 10:23.323
To take me in where?

10:23.356 --> 10:25.859
Ooh, I can't answer that.
(laughs)

10:28.862 --> 10:30.430
Oh... I'm sorry.

10:30.463 --> 10:31.899
I need to talk to my brother.

10:31.932 --> 10:33.100
I'm sorry, you-you can't.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.735
Luke! Lu...
(taser crackles quietly)

10:42.776 --> 10:45.045
I'm so sorry about this.

10:45.078 --> 10:47.214
You seem like a nice person.

10:49.382 --> 10:51.384
*

10:59.426 --> 11:01.762
(static crackling)

11:15.475 --> 11:17.677
*

11:23.150 --> 11:24.918
(man whistles sharply)

11:24.952 --> 11:27.687
(blipping)

11:33.961 --> 11:36.163
(blipping continues)

11:54.014 --> 11:56.884
(static crackling)

12:03.190 --> 12:05.425
(indistinct conversations)

12:08.395 --> 12:11.498
(blipping)

12:11.531 --> 12:13.466
(blipping spikes)

12:16.303 --> 12:18.806
(blipping spikes)

12:27.480 --> 12:29.249
(buzzing)

12:29.282 --> 12:31.819
She got a call.
Who's it from?

12:33.320 --> 12:34.387
"Unknown Caller."

12:36.824 --> 12:38.558
Hi, you've reached Laurel Healy.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.260
I can't answer my phone
right now.

12:40.293 --> 12:41.795
Please leave a message
after the beep.

12:44.998 --> 12:47.000
(static crackling)

12:58.178 --> 12:59.112
She's late.

12:59.146 --> 13:01.314
We were supposed to meet
for lunch an hour ago.

13:01.348 --> 13:03.483
I tried calling her.
Do you think
she's sick of us?

13:03.516 --> 13:05.085
Nah.
Do you need something?

13:05.118 --> 13:06.353
(blipping spikes)
Uh, yeah.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.188
Laurel.
SCARLETT: She's out.

13:08.221 --> 13:09.990
(blipping)

13:10.023 --> 13:11.291
Do you need something?

13:11.324 --> 13:13.160
Uh, no. I'm all right.

13:13.193 --> 13:15.028
Uh, Rochelle...

13:15.062 --> 13:16.363
Oh, excuse us.
Ah...

13:16.396 --> 13:17.831
Mmm.
Uh-huh.

13:17.865 --> 13:19.332
What is it?

13:19.366 --> 13:21.168
(quietly):
She's infected.

13:21.201 --> 13:23.336
It's picking up her
high-frequency communication.

13:23.370 --> 13:25.839
Who are you calling?

13:25.873 --> 13:27.240
Laurel.

13:27.274 --> 13:29.242
You won't get her.

13:31.278 --> 13:33.180
Why am I here?

13:33.213 --> 13:35.949
To help with an investigation.

13:37.450 --> 13:38.886
Who are you?

13:38.919 --> 13:41.221
I'm Dr. Colin Mitchell.

13:41.254 --> 13:45.125
I'm a psychiatrist
on retainer with the FBI.

13:47.427 --> 13:50.130
On a scale of one to ten, with
ten being the most tolerant,

13:50.163 --> 13:52.332
how would you describe
your tolerance for pain?

13:55.002 --> 13:56.269
One.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.274
On a scale
of one to ten,

14:01.308 --> 14:03.176
with ten being
the most fearful,

14:03.210 --> 14:06.246
how would you describe
your fear of drowning?

14:06.279 --> 14:10.450
KRETCHNER:
Do you take any heart
medication, Ms. Healy?

14:10.483 --> 14:12.152
No.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.354
You ever been told by
a health professional

14:14.387 --> 14:16.189
that you have
an abnormal resting

14:16.223 --> 14:19.259
or exercise
electrocardiogram?

14:19.292 --> 14:20.627
Why?

14:20.660 --> 14:22.595
It'll help us modify
your treatment.

14:22.629 --> 14:25.298
What-what treatment?

14:25.332 --> 14:28.368
The treatment specified
for your questioning.

14:32.405 --> 14:33.974
Is this about torture?

14:34.007 --> 14:35.308
Tor...
(laughs)

14:35.342 --> 14:37.010
No.

14:37.044 --> 14:39.346
No.
Is someone here
planning to torture me?

14:39.379 --> 14:41.982
KRETCHNER:
No.
Then why am I here?

14:42.015 --> 14:44.184
To, uh...

14:44.217 --> 14:45.685
help with
the investigation.

14:45.718 --> 14:48.388
(blood pressure cuff hisses)

14:48.421 --> 14:50.257
KRETCHNER:
Oh, great.

14:50.290 --> 14:52.325
120/70.

14:52.359 --> 14:53.626
You're quite
healthy.

14:53.660 --> 14:56.329
Mentally, she's stable.

14:56.363 --> 14:58.531
There should be no significant
mental aftereffects.

14:58.565 --> 15:02.169
Of course, I'd want to reanalyze
her after each regimen.

15:02.202 --> 15:03.636
Physically?

15:03.670 --> 15:05.472
Blood pressure
and pulse strong.

15:05.505 --> 15:07.640
I would suggest
limiting regimens

15:07.674 --> 15:09.309
to five-minute sessions
with breaks of ten minutes.

15:09.342 --> 15:11.444
I'll re-check her vital signs
between sessions

15:11.478 --> 15:13.546
and we can modify
the lengths based on that.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.548
CORNISH:
Possibilities of organ failure?
KRETCHNER: Low.

15:15.582 --> 15:17.384
But I would avoid
the abdominal area.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.419
She had her
appendix out...

15:19.452 --> 15:21.421
eight years ago,
and it left some scarring.

15:21.454 --> 15:23.190
MARCHANT:
Open-handed slaps?
Fine.

15:23.223 --> 15:25.458
And closed-fist contact
in the chest area.

15:25.492 --> 15:27.327
She'll accuse me
of assaulting her.

15:27.360 --> 15:28.428
Just want to warn you.

15:30.330 --> 15:31.564
Why?

15:31.598 --> 15:34.001
Because she's lying.

15:37.404 --> 15:38.505
(door opens)

15:38.538 --> 15:39.973
Ms. Healy.

15:40.007 --> 15:41.341
Thank you for your cooperation.

15:41.374 --> 15:42.642
We just have
a few more questions.

15:44.377 --> 15:46.446
Him?

15:46.479 --> 15:48.515
No, no.
What-what has he told you?

15:48.548 --> 15:50.350
If you don't mind
coming with us...?

15:50.383 --> 15:52.419
Whatever he said, it's a lie.

15:52.452 --> 15:53.686
He attacked me.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.655
I already told them
about your lies.

15:55.688 --> 15:57.457
This is illegal
and you know it.

15:57.490 --> 15:59.592
Uh, not with
a ticking clock scenario

15:59.626 --> 16:01.361
and with the consent of
the two Intelligence chairs.

16:01.394 --> 16:02.529
Just... here, please.

16:07.367 --> 16:09.969
Wait, you said the two chairs
of the Intelligence committee?

16:11.604 --> 16:14.474
Those chairs have changed
since the senatorial handover.

16:14.507 --> 16:16.409
They're new. Have you checked
with the new ones?

16:18.611 --> 16:21.448
As part of my questioning,
an FBI lawyer must be present.

16:25.252 --> 16:27.054
If that lawyer is watching,

16:27.087 --> 16:29.389
the Intelligence committee
has changed leadership.

16:29.422 --> 16:31.624
You need the consent
of the two new leaders.

16:34.461 --> 16:37.430
Can I tell Mr. Ritter
what this is regarding?

16:38.498 --> 16:40.333
Tell him it's regarding
Laurel Healy.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.335
It's regarding Laurel Healy.

16:44.537 --> 16:45.738
What's wrong?

16:49.509 --> 16:51.478
I will get this back.

16:51.511 --> 16:54.247
Yeah.

16:54.281 --> 16:55.648
Laurel was supposed
to meet me for lunch.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.117
And she didn't make it.

16:57.150 --> 16:58.485
GUSTAV: I have a GPS
trigger on her cell.

16:58.518 --> 16:59.552
It got disconnected

16:59.586 --> 17:00.753
this morning
leaving her office.

17:00.787 --> 17:02.555
The trigger sent
out a warning

17:02.589 --> 17:05.492
that someone was trying
to unlock its encryption.

17:05.525 --> 17:06.493
Hey, buddy, can you get
in here a second?

17:06.526 --> 17:08.061
(Gustav's app blipping)

17:11.231 --> 17:12.432
(blipping stops,
Gustav chuckles weakly)

17:12.465 --> 17:15.168
Senator Red Wheatus.

17:15.202 --> 17:16.403
(clears throat)

17:16.436 --> 17:17.504
Dr. Bobb.

17:19.439 --> 17:21.274
Rochelle. Daudier.

17:21.308 --> 17:23.843
Well. Nice to meet you both.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.346
I do think black lives matter.

17:26.379 --> 17:28.348
Mm-hmm.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.616
Let's go.

17:31.684 --> 17:34.087
MARCHANT:
Uh, actually, sir,

17:34.121 --> 17:37.290
this is only open
to SCI-four clearance today.

17:37.324 --> 17:39.392
Ooh, sorry.

17:39.426 --> 17:41.228
It's my first time doing this.

17:41.261 --> 17:42.529
Ah! Senator Healy.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.397
Thanks for joining us.

17:44.431 --> 17:46.233
It's just
the two chairs today?

17:46.266 --> 17:48.768
Yes, sir.
Emergency session.

17:48.801 --> 17:50.603
Well, I'll leave you two.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.775
(clears throat)
We have a C-dash-5 scenario--

17:55.808 --> 17:59.612
a possible bioterrorism attack
within the Capitol grounds--

17:59.646 --> 18:01.214
and we are asking for

18:01.248 --> 18:03.583
Appendix Q
interrogation protocol.

18:03.616 --> 18:05.452
This is about the head explosion
this morning?

18:05.485 --> 18:06.819
What head
explosion?

18:06.853 --> 18:09.156
One of my interns,
at the senate gym.

18:09.189 --> 18:10.557
Poor kid.

18:10.590 --> 18:11.624
A terrible tragedy.

18:11.658 --> 18:13.193
Just... boom.

18:13.226 --> 18:15.528
Clearly, terrorists
are coming after me

18:15.562 --> 18:17.797
because of my strong
stand on terrorism.

18:17.830 --> 18:19.532
I thought the CDC was
pursuing these strokes

18:19.566 --> 18:20.800
as a physical ailment.

18:20.833 --> 18:23.603
We have some chatter suggesting

18:23.636 --> 18:25.705
the Islamic Ra'id Front
is responsible

18:25.738 --> 18:27.707
and plans to conduct
more attacks in the future.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.876
That chatter isn't
determinative.

18:32.645 --> 18:35.582
But the threat
is serious enough

18:35.615 --> 18:37.517
that we must take it...

18:37.550 --> 18:38.818
seriously.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.722
Who is it you have in custody?
MARCHANT:
A local D.C. resident

18:42.755 --> 18:44.224
who has connections
to the victims

18:44.257 --> 18:45.692
and sympathies
with the Ra'id Front.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.794
Good. Where do I sign?

18:47.827 --> 18:51.164
Let's go, Luke.
It's Fort Apache time.

18:51.198 --> 18:52.399
What were these sympathies

18:52.432 --> 18:53.866
with the Ra'ids?

18:53.900 --> 18:55.502
Excuse me?

18:55.535 --> 18:57.337
You said
the suspect...
Not a suspect.

18:57.370 --> 18:59.406
Merely a person
of interest.

18:59.439 --> 19:01.541
Oh, the "person of interest" had
sympathies with the Ra'id Front.

19:01.574 --> 19:02.742
What were
these sympathies?

19:02.775 --> 19:04.344
This person tried to hide

19:04.377 --> 19:06.446
the identity of
a known Ra'id sympathizer,

19:06.479 --> 19:08.181
an ambulance driver,
from our inspectors.

19:08.215 --> 19:10.483
If it weren't for
the ticking clock scenario,

19:10.517 --> 19:13.320
we probably wouldn't ask
for such extreme measures,

19:13.353 --> 19:15.588
but we can't risk another
death on Capitol Hill.

19:15.622 --> 19:17.657
We need to move fast.

19:22.295 --> 19:24.364
No, I want to see the stats

19:24.397 --> 19:26.299
on this person
of interest.
Come on! Are you kidding me?

19:26.333 --> 19:28.701
They're coming
after me, Luke!
MARCHANT: Sorry, Senator,

19:28.735 --> 19:30.737
we can't reveal those details
at this time.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.639
Is this about
your bug fixation?

19:32.672 --> 19:33.840
Shut up, Red.

19:33.873 --> 19:35.308
RED:
Because if there is another

19:35.342 --> 19:36.809
head explosion on my staff,

19:36.843 --> 19:39.212
you might as well kiss
your chances for 2020 good-bye.

19:39.246 --> 19:41.681
All right, well, this should
not be a political calculation.

19:41.714 --> 19:42.849
RED:
That's right!

19:42.882 --> 19:44.817
It shouldn't be.
This is about terrorism.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.919
You don't mess around
with terrorism.

19:46.953 --> 19:48.821
I will brief you
throughout the day, Senator.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.323
These are all

19:50.357 --> 19:53.726
approved Appendix Q
interrogation methods.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.695
They're reasonable
and appropriate.

19:55.728 --> 19:57.397
Especially given
the circumstances.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.539
How many of them
have you infected?

20:08.408 --> 20:10.643
With bugs?

20:13.513 --> 20:14.714
That's the wonderful thing.

20:16.583 --> 20:17.650
It's just me.

20:19.352 --> 20:20.787
I don't believe you.

20:20.820 --> 20:23.390
No, that's the great thing
about this country.

20:23.423 --> 20:24.824
Everybody here
is just doing their job.

20:24.857 --> 20:26.293
I don't have to do anything.

20:27.627 --> 20:28.695
What if I tell them?

20:29.829 --> 20:31.264
(laughs)

20:32.665 --> 20:34.734
Yes.

20:34.767 --> 20:36.703
Do.

20:36.736 --> 20:39.772
Tell them that
I'm infected with bugs

20:39.806 --> 20:41.874
who have eaten half my brains.

20:41.908 --> 20:44.477
See how that
goes over.

20:47.780 --> 20:49.649
Agent Onofrio has been infected.

20:49.682 --> 20:51.918
Half his brain has
been eaten by bugs.

20:51.951 --> 20:53.653
I'm serious.

20:53.686 --> 20:55.688
Give me a lie detector test
if you don't believe me.

20:57.757 --> 21:00.793
Might have a mental issue here.

21:00.827 --> 21:02.362
(knocking)

21:02.395 --> 21:03.696
Yeah, what?

21:03.730 --> 21:04.764
Senator?

21:04.797 --> 21:06.766
Yes, what's wrong?

21:06.799 --> 21:08.468
The senator
is busy right now.

21:08.501 --> 21:09.636
I just need a moment.

21:09.669 --> 21:12.038
Go ahead--
what is it?

21:14.674 --> 21:16.776
Senator, do you know
where your sister is?

21:16.809 --> 21:18.911
No, why?

21:18.945 --> 21:20.647
She hasn't been in the office
the last four hours.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.649
And someone is trying to break
the encryption on her phone.

21:28.388 --> 21:31.791
I'll tell Cornish
we can get started with her.

21:31.824 --> 21:34.794
You're seeming pretty
anxious about this.

21:34.827 --> 21:36.729
Why is that?

21:36.763 --> 21:39.098
I want to stop the terrorists.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.733
Why else?

21:40.767 --> 21:42.969
(phone ringing)

21:49.876 --> 21:51.411
Hello?

21:51.444 --> 21:53.680
LUKE:
You know who this is, Agent.

21:55.715 --> 21:57.484
I do.

21:57.517 --> 21:59.552
I want to know who is the
subject of your interrogation?

21:59.586 --> 22:01.821
I can't say that, sir.
You seem the most

22:01.854 --> 22:04.056
against this interrogation--
why is that?

22:05.792 --> 22:07.460
Can't say that, sir.

22:07.494 --> 22:09.028
If you're having a pang
of conscience, Agent.

22:09.061 --> 22:11.130
it's best
to follow through.

22:11.163 --> 22:12.599
Half-measures
help no one.

22:12.632 --> 22:14.133
I can't say any more.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.068
Ask about Laurel directly.

22:16.102 --> 22:18.137
Agent, answer me yes or no.

22:18.170 --> 22:19.839
Is my sister in your custody?

22:19.872 --> 22:20.973
(sighs)

22:21.007 --> 22:23.776
Agent?

22:23.810 --> 22:25.812
Okay, then let me

22:25.845 --> 22:27.046
put it this way.

22:27.079 --> 22:28.881
I'll count to five.

22:28.915 --> 22:31.050
If my sister is in some way
being held there,

22:31.083 --> 22:32.819
don't hang up.

22:32.852 --> 22:35.788
One, two, three,

22:35.822 --> 22:37.790
four...

22:37.824 --> 22:41.394
five.

22:45.698 --> 22:48.635
Are you still
on the line, Agent?

22:48.668 --> 22:50.803
I am.

22:50.837 --> 22:52.472
Thank you.

22:52.505 --> 22:54.541
They have her.

22:54.574 --> 22:56.175
What are you gonna do?

22:56.208 --> 22:57.444
(Luke chuckles)

22:57.477 --> 23:01.013
Raise holy hell.

23:06.052 --> 23:08.120
Get me Director Marchant
on the line now.

23:13.926 --> 23:15.495
Gareth?

23:16.863 --> 23:18.931
Thanks.

23:21.834 --> 23:24.937
(Gustav's app blipping)

23:42.655 --> 23:45.758
(whispering): She's
communicating to someone.

23:45.792 --> 23:47.460
(app blipping)

23:51.931 --> 23:54.801
This is creepy.
Mm-hmm.

23:59.271 --> 24:02.008
(humming)

24:03.843 --> 24:06.045
I got him.

24:07.914 --> 24:08.948
Director Marchant.

24:08.981 --> 24:10.216
Do you have my sister
in custody?

24:10.249 --> 24:11.884
No. Where you getting that?

24:11.918 --> 24:13.152
From within your office.

24:13.185 --> 24:16.523
Senator, I can tell you
without hesitation

24:16.556 --> 24:18.991
I have no idea
where your sister is.

24:19.025 --> 24:19.959
All right, you're telling me
she's not the reason

24:19.992 --> 24:21.694
for your Appendix Q request?

24:21.728 --> 24:23.195
That is correct.
She is not.

24:23.229 --> 24:24.831
And you're not about to use

24:24.864 --> 24:26.165
enhanced questioning techniques
on her?

24:26.198 --> 24:29.201
As ridiculous
as your question is, Senator,

24:29.235 --> 24:31.003
I can answer honestly
we are not.

24:31.037 --> 24:32.839
Then why am I
getting different information

24:32.872 --> 24:34.173
coming out of your office?

24:34.206 --> 24:36.075
Senator, you have
received my answer.

24:36.108 --> 24:38.545
Why don't you let us get
back to our important work.

24:38.578 --> 24:40.046
Actually, I have a better idea.

24:40.079 --> 24:41.914
You've just be subpoenaed
to a special meeting

24:41.948 --> 24:43.950
of the Intelligence Committee.

24:43.983 --> 24:45.184
Come on, you're kidding.

24:45.217 --> 24:46.919
No, sir.

24:46.953 --> 24:49.155
The ranking member can ask
for a committee vote

24:49.188 --> 24:51.624
on all chair directives.
I am doing that now.

24:51.658 --> 24:53.259
Senator, this is
ticking-clock scenario.

24:53.292 --> 24:56.095
Just this morning I watched the
head of a Hill staffer explode

24:56.128 --> 24:57.864
in my face.
Yes.

24:57.897 --> 24:59.732
And that's why we're expediting
the work of this committee.

24:59.766 --> 25:01.033
We expect you here
within the hour, Director.

25:01.067 --> 25:01.934
This is a mistake, sir.

25:01.968 --> 25:03.069
Yep.

25:03.102 --> 25:05.071
Well, I make them
from time to time.

25:05.104 --> 25:07.874
See you in an hour.

25:07.907 --> 25:10.610
Have you ever been in contact
with the Islamic Ra'id Front?

25:10.643 --> 25:11.978
No.

25:12.011 --> 25:14.013
Do you know what
the Islamic Ra'id Front is?

25:14.046 --> 25:15.948
No.

25:15.982 --> 25:18.150
Then how do you know
you weren't in contact with it?

25:18.184 --> 25:21.053
To the best of my knowledge,

25:21.087 --> 25:24.156
I have not been in contact
with Islamic Ra'id Front.

25:24.190 --> 25:26.993
Do you know
who Ali Wasem is?

25:27.026 --> 25:28.628
I do not.

25:28.661 --> 25:29.729
You'd ever met him?

25:29.762 --> 25:30.730
No.

25:30.763 --> 25:31.964
See?

25:31.998 --> 25:33.966
There's a lie
right there, Laurel.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.935
You have met
Ali Wasem.

25:35.968 --> 25:37.804
He was the driver
of the ambulance in which

25:37.837 --> 25:40.272
Dr. Daudier's catastrophic
head injury took place.

25:40.306 --> 25:41.240
I didn't know his name.

25:41.273 --> 25:43.643
Agent Onofrio mentioned
his name to you.
Yes.

25:43.676 --> 25:45.211
Yes, but that was weeks ago.
Okay.

25:49.048 --> 25:49.982
Who is this?

25:50.016 --> 25:51.818
GUSTAV: No, not on the phone.

25:51.851 --> 25:53.119
We can't talk on the phone.

25:53.152 --> 25:55.054
LAUREL: Come on,
this is just getting paranoid.

25:55.087 --> 25:58.658
GUSTAV:
No, not paranoid. Smart.

25:58.691 --> 26:00.059
I'll meet you
at the usual place.

26:00.092 --> 26:02.695
You were surveilling
my calls?

26:02.729 --> 26:03.896
Yes.

26:03.930 --> 26:05.297
Who were you
on the phone with?

26:06.699 --> 26:08.267
A friend.

26:08.300 --> 26:10.970
And your
friend's name?

26:11.003 --> 26:14.674
If I tell you, you'll bring him
in for questioning, right?

26:14.707 --> 26:16.142
Right.

26:16.175 --> 26:18.778
Well, then I can't tell you.

26:18.811 --> 26:22.615
You think
you're being noble and good

26:22.649 --> 26:24.083
by staying committed
to a friend.

26:24.116 --> 26:27.019
But to me, it looks like
you're hiding something;

26:27.053 --> 26:29.989
something that will...
hurt this country.

26:30.022 --> 26:33.960
Are you patriotic,
Laurel?

26:33.993 --> 26:36.963
What do you know
about Anthony?

26:36.996 --> 26:38.965
Agent Onofrio?
I'm not here
to answer questions.

26:38.998 --> 26:41.701
Did you know that his brain
has been eaten by bugs?

26:41.734 --> 26:42.935
Did you know that?

26:42.969 --> 26:45.037
There might be
mental illness here.

26:45.071 --> 26:48.007
And we can't aggressively
interrogate a subject

26:48.040 --> 26:49.709
with delusional disorder,
with psychotic symptoms--

26:49.742 --> 26:51.110
In what way is she psychotic?

26:51.143 --> 26:54.781
She thinks her interrogators
are bug creatures.

26:54.814 --> 26:56.115
(groans)

26:56.148 --> 26:59.786
All right, I'll get approval.

26:59.819 --> 27:02.154
(indistinct chatter)

27:02.188 --> 27:04.056
You are gonna regret this.

27:04.090 --> 27:06.125
No, you will.

27:06.158 --> 27:08.027
Now, people don't
like torture.

27:08.060 --> 27:09.729
In fact, one of your
own caucus members

27:09.762 --> 27:12.932
doesn't like torture--
Senator Hodges, the war hero?

27:12.965 --> 27:15.868
Hi, Chuck.
Let's get this over with.

27:15.902 --> 27:19.205
Oh, oh, that's what
you're hanging your hat on?

27:19.238 --> 27:21.140
Unfortunately,

27:21.173 --> 27:24.010
some of your caucus members
are ready to flee to me.

27:24.043 --> 27:26.713
Especially
after the country sees

27:26.746 --> 27:28.815
how you want
to coddle terrorists.

27:28.848 --> 27:31.050
Mm-mm.

27:33.019 --> 27:34.253
(static crackling)

27:34.286 --> 27:37.123
(panting)

27:37.156 --> 27:38.991
Ah... damn it!

27:39.025 --> 27:40.092
What?

27:40.126 --> 27:42.094
Damn it.
I think I lost him.

27:42.128 --> 27:44.430
They must need to be
in range of each other.

27:44.463 --> 27:46.132
50 feet or so.

27:46.165 --> 27:47.934
So, we can't locate Laurel?

27:47.967 --> 27:50.202
No, I thought we could
follow the bug people

27:50.236 --> 27:52.238
to where they were
holding Laurel...

27:52.271 --> 27:54.273
Did you record
their communication?

27:54.306 --> 27:55.842
What?

27:55.875 --> 27:57.143
Their high-frequency
communication--

27:57.176 --> 27:58.945
did you record it?

27:58.978 --> 28:00.279
Yeah.

28:02.248 --> 28:04.884
(blipping)

28:06.152 --> 28:08.054
Good, send that out.

28:08.087 --> 28:10.022
What do you mean?

28:10.056 --> 28:11.991
Well, instead of tracking people
who send out that signal,

28:12.024 --> 28:14.126
can you send it out
as if it were you?

28:15.094 --> 28:17.396
(chuckles)
Yes.

28:17.429 --> 28:18.430
Then do it.

28:20.332 --> 28:22.869
(stammers)
I would've come to that.

28:22.902 --> 28:26.005
I'm sure you would have.

28:26.038 --> 28:27.206
The matter under discussion

28:27.239 --> 28:30.777
involves an Appendix Q scenario.

28:30.810 --> 28:35.314
That means a time-sensitive
ticking-bomb terrorist attack.

28:35.347 --> 28:38.217
I would encourage us
to expedite these proceedings

28:38.250 --> 28:39.886
by keeping our comments

28:39.919 --> 28:41.020
to a minimum.

28:41.053 --> 28:43.790
Lives are at stake.

28:43.823 --> 28:45.224
Anything more, Senator?

28:45.257 --> 28:47.193
No.

28:47.226 --> 28:48.961
There's nothing more from me.

28:48.995 --> 28:51.397
All my questions have been
answered prior to this meeting.

28:53.432 --> 28:55.367
(clears throat)
Director Marchant?

28:55.401 --> 28:57.236
Now, how do you define

28:57.269 --> 29:00.272
Appendix Q
interrogation allowances?

29:00.306 --> 29:03.509
The agency will be allowed
more forward leaning

29:03.542 --> 29:06.178
interview methods when there's
an impending terrorist attack.

29:06.212 --> 29:07.246
And how do those methods

29:07.279 --> 29:09.148
not constitute torture,

29:09.181 --> 29:12.118
as defined
by Executive Order 13491?

29:12.151 --> 29:13.152
Well, just to begin,

29:13.185 --> 29:15.187
this country does not torture.

29:15.221 --> 29:17.189
Uh, it's not within our makeup--

29:17.223 --> 29:19.058
Is water-boarding torture,
Director?

29:20.092 --> 29:21.060
Yes.

29:21.093 --> 29:23.129
So, we do not water-board?

29:23.162 --> 29:25.164
That is
correct.

29:31.470 --> 29:34.306
Now, do we use water

29:34.340 --> 29:36.342
in our interviewing
of suspects?

29:36.375 --> 29:40.146
Well, maybe a glass
of water now and then,

29:40.179 --> 29:42.014
(committee laughing)
if they ask.

29:44.851 --> 29:47.219
Do we use water
in any other manner?

29:49.021 --> 29:51.257
Yes, infrequently.

29:51.290 --> 29:52.324
But it's well within...

29:52.358 --> 29:53.392
And how is the water used?

29:53.425 --> 29:56.562
Uh, in an exercise

29:56.595 --> 29:59.999
we refer to
as "controlled immersion."

30:00.032 --> 30:02.101
LUKE: And how does
controlled immersion

30:02.134 --> 30:04.336
differ from water-boarding?

30:04.370 --> 30:06.372
MARCHANT:
The amount of water is reduced.

30:06.405 --> 30:08.407
Uh, the experience is more one

30:08.440 --> 30:10.042
of trying to catch your breath

30:10.076 --> 30:12.278
than simulated drowning--
I want to be clear.

30:12.311 --> 30:14.080
These are terrorists!

30:14.113 --> 30:17.283
Do I need to show my colleague
photos of victims of ISIS?

30:17.316 --> 30:18.117
Women and children.

30:18.150 --> 30:19.551
I-I would do
a hell of a lot worse

30:19.585 --> 30:21.187
than immersion
if it were up to me--

30:21.220 --> 30:23.956
Oh, I-I know you would do
a hell of a lot worse...

30:23.990 --> 30:26.192
Senator, have you neglected
to pay your cable bill again?

30:26.225 --> 30:29.061
It is a matter
of national security

30:29.095 --> 30:31.363
and-and our national identity.
Or have you just gone
completely off the grid?

30:31.397 --> 30:33.499
Now, you said,
you said it-it is...

30:33.532 --> 30:35.367
Your brother is
going to lose.

30:35.401 --> 30:36.335
No.

30:36.368 --> 30:38.504
Americans don't like torture.

30:38.537 --> 30:41.107
It's why you have to lie
and call it something else.

30:43.175 --> 30:45.211
Here's the thing
about the American public.

30:45.244 --> 30:48.047
I was down
in Abbeville, Louisiana.

30:48.080 --> 30:49.248
Best catfish in the country.

30:49.281 --> 30:51.583
And my car got stuck in the mud.

30:51.617 --> 30:54.053
This family of farmers came by.

30:54.086 --> 30:55.221
Got me out.

30:55.254 --> 30:56.455
Invited me home for dinner.

30:56.488 --> 30:58.157
Towed my car to a shop.

30:58.190 --> 31:00.159
Gave me a few hundred dollars
to get me home.

31:00.192 --> 31:02.161
They had nothing.

31:02.194 --> 31:05.164
And they treated me
like I was their son.

31:05.197 --> 31:07.399
That's the American people.

31:07.433 --> 31:09.135
They are great
individually.

31:09.168 --> 31:10.636
Nicest people
in the world.

31:10.669 --> 31:12.972
But get them in a group, voting?

31:13.005 --> 31:14.673
(indistinct arguing on TV)

31:14.706 --> 31:16.408
They turn vicious.

31:16.442 --> 31:18.677
LUKE: It's a matter
of national identity.

31:18.710 --> 31:22.348
And I believe the American
people to be smarter than that.

31:22.381 --> 31:24.383
(applause)
Oh.

31:24.416 --> 31:27.920
Looks like your brother
scored a point.

31:27.954 --> 31:29.922
But isn't the real question

31:29.956 --> 31:31.390
whether torture is effective?

31:31.423 --> 31:33.459
No, I think
the real question is

31:33.492 --> 31:35.394
why do we have
to look at it at all?

31:35.427 --> 31:38.330
Like, my car mechanic,
Rodrigo, used to say,

31:38.364 --> 31:41.567
"Some things in life
are better left mysterious."

31:41.600 --> 31:44.170
Why do we have
to look at torture?

31:44.203 --> 31:46.372
Let's stop talking
about it altogether.

31:46.405 --> 31:47.706
Yes, but don't we at least...?

31:47.739 --> 31:49.108
No.

31:49.141 --> 31:50.376
But...

31:50.409 --> 31:53.245
Shh.

31:53.279 --> 31:55.281
But...

31:57.383 --> 32:00.052
(crowd chattering)

32:00.086 --> 32:02.388
You're down by one vote.

32:05.457 --> 32:07.593
I-I count myself up by one.

32:07.626 --> 32:09.295
No, you lost a Republican.

32:09.328 --> 32:10.596
Who?

32:10.629 --> 32:13.265
Chuck Hodges.
The war hero? No.

32:13.299 --> 32:14.466
No, he'll never
vote for torture.

32:14.500 --> 32:16.102
No, he had to leave.

32:16.135 --> 32:17.469
He's not there.

32:17.503 --> 32:20.139
Wait, what? What happened?
I don't know.

32:24.343 --> 32:25.744
Dad?

32:25.777 --> 32:28.347
Your friend, Chuck Hodges--
where is he?

32:29.348 --> 32:31.650
There.

32:31.683 --> 32:34.386
Not joggers. Why joggers?

32:34.420 --> 32:36.122
(blipping)

32:36.155 --> 32:37.589
See? Broadcast it.

32:37.623 --> 32:39.525
(beeps)

32:39.558 --> 32:43.395
(blipping)

32:45.664 --> 32:48.500
Crap. Crap.

32:48.534 --> 32:49.701
(blipping continues)

32:49.735 --> 32:51.337
Crap, crap, crap.

32:51.370 --> 32:52.504
Just stare back.

32:52.538 --> 32:54.406
He knows we're not
one of them.

32:54.440 --> 32:57.509
He'll definitely know
if we don't stare back.

32:57.543 --> 32:59.511
Just keep broadcasting.
It's okay.

32:59.545 --> 33:01.247
What could he do?
Kill us.

33:03.182 --> 33:04.450
(whispering):
Just act like them.

33:04.483 --> 33:06.452
How do you act
like them?
I don't know.

33:06.485 --> 33:08.787
Turn...

33:08.820 --> 33:11.457
slowly.

33:15.427 --> 33:18.030
(blipping continues)

33:19.365 --> 33:21.300
(sighs)
Where are you going?

33:21.333 --> 33:22.768
Following him.
Where?

33:22.801 --> 33:25.437
See if he leads us to Laurel.

33:27.206 --> 33:29.408
LUKE (on TV): Director Marchant,
how do you define

33:29.441 --> 33:31.077
Appendix Q interrogation
allowances?

33:31.110 --> 33:32.578
What's that?

33:32.611 --> 33:34.480
Flow control valve.

33:34.513 --> 33:36.448
It regulates the water pressure

33:36.482 --> 33:38.384
so the immersion doesn't reach
to the level of torture.

33:38.417 --> 33:40.519
So it doesn't drown me?

33:44.490 --> 33:47.326
So you put the cloth
over my face,

33:47.359 --> 33:49.195
and then you pour that over it

33:49.228 --> 33:50.729
for how long?
One minute.

33:50.762 --> 33:52.464
And that simulates drowning?

33:52.498 --> 33:54.666
Immersion.

33:54.700 --> 33:57.336
And, hey, the vote could
still go your way.

33:57.369 --> 33:59.505
(sighs)
LUKE: We do not protect
the American people

33:59.538 --> 34:00.806
by torturing them.

34:00.839 --> 34:02.408
Come on, Luke.

34:02.441 --> 34:04.543
...danger and, by the way,
puts our POWs...

34:10.849 --> 34:14.553
(indistinct chatter)

34:14.586 --> 34:16.622
(gavel banging)

34:16.655 --> 34:18.824
Okay, let's get voting.

34:18.857 --> 34:20.559
(indistinct chatter)

34:23.495 --> 34:26.398
Come on.
Time's a-wasting.

34:29.701 --> 34:32.704
Come on, everybody,
take their seats, please.

34:34.140 --> 34:36.308
Where is he, Dad?
I need him here.

34:36.342 --> 34:38.444
Out of pocket.
The staff is saying

34:38.477 --> 34:39.878
he's at his daughter's
dance recital.

34:39.911 --> 34:41.480
You're kidding?

34:41.513 --> 34:42.681
He couldn't wait
to vote on this?

34:42.714 --> 34:44.216
No, it's not that.

34:44.250 --> 34:45.751
When I was in the senate,

34:45.784 --> 34:47.619
"daughter's dance recital" meant
"sleeping with a mistress."

34:48.720 --> 34:50.856
Well,
do you have any idea where?

34:50.889 --> 34:53.125
Give me an hour.

34:53.159 --> 34:55.561
I'll try, but hurry, Dad.

34:55.594 --> 34:58.497
RED: I'll ask for a motion
on our Appendix Q understanding.

34:58.530 --> 35:01.233
Excuse me, Mr. Chairman.

35:01.267 --> 35:03.535
I have a few words
I'd like to share

35:03.569 --> 35:07.373
before we, uh... vote.

35:07.406 --> 35:09.508
(clears throat)

35:09.541 --> 35:11.543
Back in 1803...

35:14.513 --> 35:15.714
(panting)

35:15.747 --> 35:17.783
That's... that's not good.

35:17.816 --> 35:20.419
(sighs)
He led us right back
to where we started.

35:20.452 --> 35:24.323
Maybe you're wrong about
what the message says.

35:36.268 --> 35:37.803
So what now?
(sighs)

35:37.836 --> 35:39.805
This message you
intercepted--

35:39.838 --> 35:41.807
let me hear it.

35:41.840 --> 35:45.611
This is just a 500 kilohertz
signal translated for our ears.

35:45.644 --> 35:47.546
Yeah. We don't know
what it means, right?

35:47.579 --> 35:49.548
Right.

35:49.581 --> 35:51.417
Okay. Play it again.

35:51.450 --> 35:53.952
(blipping)
Okay.

35:53.985 --> 35:57.523
So just broadcast part of it,
just the first part.

35:57.556 --> 35:59.325
The... "Oh," or whatever.

35:59.358 --> 36:02.694
And let's see
what one of them does.

36:02.728 --> 36:04.263
Why?

36:04.296 --> 36:07.466
To find out
what their words mean.

36:08.567 --> 36:11.203
What?

36:11.237 --> 36:13.972
You're, um... you're much
smarter than I thought.

36:14.005 --> 36:16.942
You know I did graduate
pre-med from Princeton?

36:16.975 --> 36:18.577
(muffled laugh)

36:21.647 --> 36:24.650
(whispers):
Oh, here he comes.

36:26.552 --> 36:28.787
(whispering):
Okay, try the first sound.

36:28.820 --> 36:31.457
(blipping)

36:35.927 --> 36:37.563
Do it again.

36:37.596 --> 36:39.731
(blipping)

36:46.672 --> 36:49.875
Be my guest.

36:49.908 --> 36:51.943
Let's try the
second word.

36:56.515 --> 36:57.883
(blipping)

36:57.916 --> 37:00.652
(laughter)

37:00.686 --> 37:03.455
(laughing):
Oh, yeah. We're using this.

37:03.489 --> 37:04.423
RED:
Who knows who

37:04.456 --> 37:05.524
might be the victim
tomorrow of terrorists.

37:05.557 --> 37:08.327
Any of us. You, Luke.

37:08.360 --> 37:09.528
Your staff.

37:09.561 --> 37:13.031
Yes, and if we torture,
all our enemies

37:13.064 --> 37:15.467
will use torture
on our soldiers.
Look at Jack Bauer.

37:15.501 --> 37:18.370
What did he have to do
to keep America safe?

37:18.404 --> 37:20.439
Jack Bauer?
That's a fictional character.

37:20.472 --> 37:22.308
He's not real.

37:22.341 --> 37:24.643
Justice Scalia used him
as a legal argument.
Yes, and

37:24.676 --> 37:26.878
it was insane then,
just like it is insane now.

37:26.912 --> 37:29.014
Justice Scalia should be honored
by people like you,

37:29.047 --> 37:30.616
not disrespected.
This debate

37:30.649 --> 37:32.318
is far too critical.
It's a debate

37:32.351 --> 37:33.719
about our national security
and our national identity.

37:33.752 --> 37:35.053
No. What's left
of your credibility is...

37:35.086 --> 37:36.455
(gavel banging)
Let-Let's just vote!

37:36.488 --> 37:37.856
No, I have more to say.

37:39.825 --> 37:41.693
Forget it. I'm done.
Let's vote.

37:42.994 --> 37:44.863
I can count
on your vote, Senator?

37:44.896 --> 37:47.333
Not with the
public watching.

37:47.366 --> 37:48.734
That's why I tried
to stay away.

37:48.767 --> 37:51.303
I have to vote for this.

37:54.406 --> 37:56.408
(sighs)

38:01.747 --> 38:03.382
All right, all those in favor

38:03.415 --> 38:04.750
of the current definition
of Appendix Q,

38:04.783 --> 38:07.786
please signify
by raising your hand.

38:07.819 --> 38:09.020
That's one, two,
three, four, five, six,

38:09.054 --> 38:10.656
seven, eight, nine, ten.

38:10.689 --> 38:12.391
11. That's 11 yeses,

38:12.424 --> 38:14.593
and I'll join in,
making that a majority.

38:14.626 --> 38:17.763
Now, all those against.

38:17.796 --> 38:20.799
Sorry, Laurel. Guys.

38:20.832 --> 38:23.101
Part of me was wishing
that went the other way.

38:23.134 --> 38:24.503
It still can.

38:24.536 --> 38:25.904
You don't need to do this.

38:25.937 --> 38:27.038
Yes, I do.

38:27.072 --> 38:29.508
I like you,
but I have a job to do,

38:29.541 --> 38:31.343
and I believe in that job.

38:31.377 --> 38:33.479
I believe the country survives
because I do my job.

38:33.512 --> 38:36.114
It doesn't. I-I don't know
anything. I... I... I...

38:36.147 --> 38:37.616
We'll find out.

38:37.649 --> 38:40.118
RED:
Senators, you can't vote twice.

38:40.151 --> 38:42.654
All those who voted yes,
please...

38:42.688 --> 38:44.956
ple-please refrain
from voting no.

38:44.990 --> 38:46.925
All right, once again,

38:46.958 --> 38:49.361
all those against
the current definition,

38:49.395 --> 38:51.029
please signify
by raising your hands.

38:53.399 --> 38:54.800
One, two...

38:58.036 --> 39:00.506
(people murmuring)
Senators.

39:00.539 --> 39:02.708
Again, you already voted yes.

39:02.741 --> 39:04.075
(blipping)

39:04.109 --> 39:05.711
Please refrain...

39:05.744 --> 39:08.447
(people murmuring)

39:10.115 --> 39:12.117
This is so cool.

39:12.150 --> 39:14.720
(muffled laughter)

39:17.589 --> 39:19.691
I think
we can discount the no votes.

39:19.725 --> 39:21.460
We already have
a "yes" confirmation.

39:21.493 --> 39:23.429
Now, excuse me, Mr. Chairman.

39:23.462 --> 39:25.096
We do not have
a "yes" confirmation.

39:25.130 --> 39:28.467
The "yes" votes negated
themselves by voting "no," also.

39:28.500 --> 39:30.068
Well, I think that
mischaracterizes what happened.

39:30.101 --> 39:31.703
No, it's exactly what happened.

39:31.737 --> 39:33.472
(gavel bangs)
Then let's vote again.

39:33.505 --> 39:36.475
Remember, senators,

39:36.508 --> 39:39.445
you can only
vote once. Once.

39:39.478 --> 39:41.580
All those in favor
of the motion,

39:41.613 --> 39:43.749
please signify
by raising your hands.

39:43.782 --> 39:46.585
(blipping)

39:47.786 --> 39:50.489
(people murmuring)

39:51.523 --> 39:53.492
RED:
Uh, se...

39:53.525 --> 39:55.494
Uh, senators?

39:55.527 --> 39:58.129
(loud banging on walls,
yelling and gasping)

39:58.163 --> 40:00.198
(loud, indistinct,
overlapping chatter)

40:00.231 --> 40:03.969
(loud head-banging,
loud chatter continues)

40:05.203 --> 40:07.405
LUKE:
You all right?

40:10.509 --> 40:13.445
We better get out of here.

40:13.479 --> 40:15.681
(loud,
overlapping chatter continues)

40:16.848 --> 40:19.785
(loud thudding on wall)

40:35.801 --> 40:37.669
(gasps)

40:37.703 --> 40:39.705
Want a ride?

40:39.738 --> 40:41.707
Sure.

40:41.740 --> 40:43.809
(sighs)

40:50.816 --> 40:53.184
You sure you want
out here, at work?

40:53.218 --> 40:56.488
Yes. Why?

40:56.522 --> 40:58.189
I would have
taken the day off.

40:58.223 --> 40:59.658
(chuckles)

41:00.859 --> 41:02.894
No, there's too much to do.

41:05.230 --> 41:09.501
As-as part of my
training, I, uh...

41:09.535 --> 41:12.571
I had to experience

41:12.604 --> 41:16.107
all the interrogations I
was going to inflict on you.

41:16.141 --> 41:19.678
You were lucky.

41:22.313 --> 41:24.683
See you again.

41:30.255 --> 41:31.823
You're okay.

41:31.857 --> 41:33.258
Oh, my God,
are you all right?

41:33.291 --> 41:34.893
We've been trying
to find you.

41:34.926 --> 41:36.294
ROCHELLE:
Your brother is going crazy.

41:36.327 --> 41:38.496
Where is he?

41:40.666 --> 41:43.802
I don't know how you did it,
but thank you.

42:01.186 --> 42:03.321
(sighs)

42:03.354 --> 42:05.957
(sniffles)
I thought I'd lost you.

42:05.991 --> 42:07.993
You did... for a while.

42:08.026 --> 42:10.295
Are you okay?
Yeah.

42:10.328 --> 42:12.330
Laurel. Oh, my God,
there you are.

42:12.363 --> 42:13.932
Dad.

42:13.965 --> 42:16.034
Oh.

42:16.067 --> 42:18.604
(static)
You okay?

42:18.637 --> 42:21.039
(static crackling)

42:27.946 --> 42:31.216
