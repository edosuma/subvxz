WEBVTT

00:02.936 --> 00:04.738
(whimpers, crying)

00:04.772 --> 00:05.839
(screams)

00:05.873 --> 00:08.008
ANNOUNCER: AHS 1984.

00:08.042 --> 00:10.744
All new,
Wednesdays at 10:00 on FX.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.147
(motors revving)

00:13.181 --> 00:16.784
ANNOUNCER: FX presents Mayans.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.154
- Previously
on "Mayans M.C."...

00:20.188 --> 00:21.189
- I understand you had
something to say

00:21.222 --> 00:22.856
about our club.

00:24.092 --> 00:25.159
- What the fuck?

00:27.395 --> 00:29.363
- Ileana's been
borrowing money.

00:29.397 --> 00:30.431
- Wait, are you gonna use this?

00:30.464 --> 00:31.999
- I'm gonna offer her
some help.

00:32.032 --> 00:34.502
- That's called a bribe.

00:34.535 --> 00:37.271
- I just thought maybe
we could help each other.

00:37.305 --> 00:41.675
- I fear our rebel queen
now flies on the wings

00:41.709 --> 00:43.944
of a golden butterfly.

00:43.977 --> 00:46.114
- Palomo.
- What does this mean?

00:46.147 --> 00:47.448
- Potter knows
you're involved.

00:47.481 --> 00:49.617
He thinks he can
shut down the uprisings

00:49.650 --> 00:51.185
by destroying Palomo.

00:51.219 --> 00:52.720
He wants me to get her dirty.

01:03.797 --> 01:05.133
- Me and the boy scout

01:05.166 --> 01:06.600
gonna ride out
from the cemetery.

01:06.634 --> 01:08.102
Still gotta handle
that parole shit.

01:08.136 --> 01:11.139
Should be back
in a day or two.

01:12.673 --> 01:14.074
- I'm coming.

01:18.479 --> 01:20.481
- I think he missed you.

01:29.257 --> 01:32.059
You know who we are?

01:37.998 --> 01:39.800
Nothing?

01:41.769 --> 01:43.904
- I don't need to know
who you are.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.839
- And why's that?

01:45.873 --> 01:47.908
- Because when this is over,

01:47.941 --> 01:51.945
either I'm dead,
or you're dead.

02:13.801 --> 02:15.169
- One sec.

02:18.005 --> 02:20.174
- How goes it?

02:20.208 --> 02:22.176
- It's getting there.

02:22.210 --> 02:25.679
Martin thinks we should lower
our tax credits another 5%.

02:26.847 --> 02:28.616
- Why?

02:28.649 --> 02:30.884
- It increases
the town's bottom line.

02:30.918 --> 02:33.954
Plus, it makes us look
less corporate.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.723
Lets us play up "local boy
wanting what's best

02:35.756 --> 02:37.157
for his hometown."

02:37.191 --> 02:40.361
- Right, and what does
the local girl think?

02:41.595 --> 02:43.997
- It's more out of pocket
for us up front,

02:44.031 --> 02:47.301
but I think it's smart.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.571
- Okay.

02:57.911 --> 02:59.813
- Where are you today?

02:59.847 --> 03:02.816
- South, that Potter thing.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.184
I'll be late.

03:05.286 --> 03:06.454
- Okay.

03:08.922 --> 03:11.992
She has her
shrink appointment today.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.727
- Oh, shit.
Uh...

03:13.761 --> 03:16.997
Look, Nestor can take her.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.566
- It's okay.

03:18.599 --> 03:21.835
Dr. Luna is in one
of our buildings on 14th.

03:21.869 --> 03:24.405
I'll deliver this,
then take her.

03:24.438 --> 03:26.574
Make sure she stays.

03:26.607 --> 03:28.709
- Thank you.

03:32.980 --> 03:33.914
- Miguel.

03:38.952 --> 03:40.721
Please be careful.

03:42.823 --> 03:44.258
- Always.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.985
Reyes Carnicería.

04:12.019 --> 04:14.788
- Felipe, es Dita.

04:30.704 --> 04:33.641
- Anything in the bedroom?
- Not yet.

04:40.848 --> 04:43.183
Didn't find much,
just some old probation shit.

04:43.216 --> 04:44.318
- Yeah, just these.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.492
Let's see what he knows.

05:22.356 --> 05:24.157
- Nine years ago...

05:27.260 --> 05:28.562
Someone kicked open
the back door

05:28.596 --> 05:29.963
of my family's butcher shop.

05:29.997 --> 05:32.132
Mom?

05:32.165 --> 05:33.300
Shot our mother in the neck.

05:34.535 --> 05:36.003
Murdered her.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.242
I saw someone drive away
in a car.

05:43.577 --> 05:45.879
I remembered the car.

05:49.182 --> 05:51.485
I remember shit.

05:55.623 --> 05:57.190
I followed you that night.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.994
Chased you
to the construction zone.

06:03.864 --> 06:04.898
I saw your face.

06:04.932 --> 06:06.867
Hey! Hey!

06:08.301 --> 06:10.337
I remembered...

06:10.370 --> 06:14.408
every detail of it.

06:21.214 --> 06:24.217
I know you're the one
who killed our mother.

06:38.799 --> 06:41.702
- * Mother of exiles

06:41.735 --> 06:43.871
* The torch of hope

06:43.904 --> 06:46.707
* In the toss of the tempest

06:46.740 --> 06:49.443
* Threw us Madison's rope

06:49.477 --> 06:52.145
* But the brazen giant

06:52.179 --> 06:54.815
* With limbs astride

06:54.848 --> 06:57.751
* Blocks the golden door

06:57.785 --> 07:01.789
* To the U.S. of Lies

07:01.822 --> 07:05.726
* Damn your huddled masses

07:05.759 --> 07:08.729
* Scrub our floors

07:08.762 --> 07:11.164
* Cut our grasses

07:11.198 --> 07:13.801
* I am a wolf

07:13.834 --> 07:16.303
* A wild cur

07:16.336 --> 07:20.407
* Cut from the pack

07:20.440 --> 07:22.643
* With blood on my fur

07:22.676 --> 07:25.513
* Every howl

07:25.546 --> 07:28.315
* Marks the debt

07:28.348 --> 07:31.952
* 'Cause a beaten dog

07:33.286 --> 07:36.657
* Never forgets

07:36.690 --> 07:39.593
* Every howl

07:39.627 --> 07:42.295
* Marks the debt

07:42.329 --> 07:47.167
* 'Cause a beaten dog

07:47.200 --> 07:49.970
* Never forgets

07:52.640 --> 07:55.609
* Never forgets

08:06.987 --> 08:09.222
- We know you were
a triggerman

08:09.256 --> 08:10.958
before you were Sam Crow.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.627
You were Nomad, gun for hire.

08:13.661 --> 08:15.395
- Who the fuck hired you?

08:22.570 --> 08:23.971
Mm.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.810
- Simple question.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.044
We need a simple answer.

08:31.078 --> 08:32.913
- Just a name.

08:36.016 --> 08:38.586
- Fuck this.
- Was it the cartel?

08:41.088 --> 08:43.657
Galindo?
- What?

08:43.691 --> 08:45.425
Why the fuck
would Galindo want Mom dead?

09:00.207 --> 09:03.611
- I apologize
for the rough ride.

09:03.644 --> 09:06.046
I'm afraid traveling
in anything comfortable

09:06.079 --> 09:07.615
might stand out.

09:07.648 --> 09:09.950
- I'll be okay.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.954
Have we confirmed
where we're meeting?

09:13.987 --> 09:17.424
- Palomo's team will reach out
with the exact location

09:17.457 --> 09:19.226
once she's on the move.

09:27.735 --> 09:30.570
How much do you think
Potter really knows?

09:31.338 --> 09:32.873
- Well, he's hard to read.

09:32.906 --> 09:37.410
All that "intellectual enigma"
bullshit.

09:37.444 --> 09:40.714
My guess,
you're still the prize.

09:40.748 --> 09:43.550
The revolution
is the immediate threat.

09:43.583 --> 09:44.785
His fear of Palomo

09:44.818 --> 09:47.254
is that she's somehow
facilitating you.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.256
Directly, indirectly...

09:49.289 --> 09:51.091
he's not sure.

09:51.124 --> 09:54.928
He's just going after
the target he can see.

09:57.030 --> 09:58.265
- Palomo.

10:07.174 --> 10:08.108
- Good morning.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.778
- Morning.

10:12.045 --> 10:13.847
- I had Nestor
drop off the book.

10:13.881 --> 10:16.416
- I got it. Thank you.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.318
- Thank you.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.789
- Marlon will help you.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.957
Just to the right.

10:32.499 --> 10:34.668
- Mrs. Galindo.
- Hi.

10:34.702 --> 10:36.536
Marlon?
- Hi.

10:36.569 --> 10:38.438
This is everything?
- Yes...

10:38.471 --> 10:40.273
- Great.
- I believe it is.

10:40.307 --> 10:41.809
- Okay.

10:41.842 --> 10:43.610
- I--if you want to start--
- Okay.

11:08.435 --> 11:10.637
- I don't get it.
What the fuck does this mean?

11:10.670 --> 11:13.741
"Ignacio Cortina, Isabel."

11:15.408 --> 11:17.711
Where'd you find this?

11:17.745 --> 11:20.580
Why--why were you
writing all this down?

11:22.515 --> 11:24.985
When all that shit
with Potter was going down,

11:25.018 --> 11:27.020
I found a lockbox
in the house.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.390
Had old legal documents,
Mom and Pop's stuff,

11:30.423 --> 11:32.392
a few pictures.

11:33.060 --> 11:36.363
Isabel Varela,
Ignacio Cortina--

11:36.396 --> 11:38.832
those were their real names.

11:38.866 --> 11:40.868
They didn't meet
on some farm in Tecate.

11:41.769 --> 11:43.436
Dad was a cop.

11:43.470 --> 11:46.373
Policía Federales.

11:49.642 --> 11:51.845
I saw pictures...

11:51.879 --> 11:54.782
of Pop with Jose Galindo.

11:55.916 --> 11:58.051
That's why I asked Happy
about the cartel.

11:59.419 --> 12:02.222
I don't know anything else.

12:31.919 --> 12:34.221
- We know these guys?

12:34.254 --> 12:36.756
- Gotta be the dude
who flew past us.

12:36.790 --> 12:40.227
- Swole Boys?
I got no idea.

12:42.930 --> 12:44.898
- Call Packer.
See what he knows.

12:46.967 --> 12:50.303
- We got some noisy friends.
- Yeah.

12:50.337 --> 12:54.074
Apparently they are, uh,
Swole Boys.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.909
- What the fuck
is a Swole Boy?

12:55.943 --> 12:58.078
- I don't know,

12:58.111 --> 12:59.612
but they certainly seem
to know us.

13:01.949 --> 13:03.250
- Looks like a lot

13:03.283 --> 13:04.784
of chemically induced
muscle mass, jefe.

13:04.818 --> 13:06.086
- Come on, man,
maybe they just want

13:06.119 --> 13:07.787
to give us an escort
to the border.

13:07.821 --> 13:09.156
You know, white and brown,

13:09.189 --> 13:11.091
all brothers under the patch.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.960
- Yeah, right.

13:13.861 --> 13:15.795
- Just left word
for the Reaper.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.703
Close to 20 of them.

13:23.736 --> 13:24.771
I don't know
about any of you guys.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.940
I'm fucking tired.

13:26.974 --> 13:28.775
- Been a long week.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.878
- We can stay local.

13:30.911 --> 13:34.414
Ride the access road
another five or six miles.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.384
- I have a feeling that's
what they're counting on.

13:37.417 --> 13:39.619
- Yeah, we should try
to stay in front of it.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.288
- And if we can't?

13:41.321 --> 13:42.990
- Then we don't.

13:52.866 --> 13:54.834
- That shit feeling better?

14:35.808 --> 14:37.010
- Here we go!

14:38.145 --> 14:40.948
- * Whoa

14:40.981 --> 14:43.783
* Hey

14:53.460 --> 14:54.427
- What?

15:00.100 --> 15:01.701
- Shit, Riz.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.136
- So much for the plan.

15:03.170 --> 15:05.405
- Payback's a bitch!

15:12.012 --> 15:12.980
- Hey, shithead!

15:31.664 --> 15:32.966
- Hey, stupid motherfuckers.

15:38.538 --> 15:39.839
- Let's go!

15:39.872 --> 15:41.341
- Go! Go!

15:49.949 --> 15:52.385
- Riz.
- Shit.

16:02.062 --> 16:04.364
- Riz!

16:04.397 --> 16:05.632
Ariza!

16:07.967 --> 16:09.602
Hey.

16:09.636 --> 16:12.972
- He's breathing.
- Hey, you with us?

16:13.006 --> 16:14.774
- Yeah.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.377
Yeah, what?

16:17.410 --> 16:20.113
Oh, fuck.

16:20.147 --> 16:22.482
I went down?
- Yeah.

16:22.515 --> 16:23.850
Just a little.

16:23.883 --> 16:26.119
- Shit.

16:26.153 --> 16:27.987
- Bring the van around.

16:29.722 --> 16:31.958
- What the fuck was that, man?

16:31.991 --> 16:33.626
- He said it was payback.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.028
- Payback for what?

16:44.937 --> 16:48.041
- It wasn't my place
to tell you.

16:48.075 --> 16:49.676
Dad knew I saw it.

16:51.411 --> 16:52.979
When I finally
asked him about it--

16:53.012 --> 16:54.747
- He said nothing.

16:54.781 --> 16:56.015
- Yeah.

17:01.354 --> 17:05.158
Everything that's gone down
between us, Angel...

17:05.192 --> 17:06.759
even if I could have--

17:06.793 --> 17:08.461
- You should have told me.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.433
He should have told me.

17:13.466 --> 17:15.435
- Pop?

17:15.468 --> 17:18.238
- Man, he never trusted me
with anything.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.341
Mom neither.

17:21.374 --> 17:22.909
- Come on, man,
that's not fair.

17:22.942 --> 17:24.177
- Fair?

17:24.211 --> 17:26.513
You have no fucking idea.

17:26.546 --> 17:27.580
Fair.

17:29.549 --> 17:33.520
Every time I walked
into a room...

17:33.553 --> 17:35.455
man, for as long as I can
remember, Mom and Pop--

17:35.488 --> 17:39.859
there'd be this--
this slight letdown.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.728
You know?

17:41.761 --> 17:44.063
Disappointment.

17:44.097 --> 17:46.065
'Cause it was me
instead of you.

17:51.571 --> 17:55.808
Oh, man, saying it...

17:55.842 --> 17:59.346
saying it out loud,
sounds fucking pathetic.

18:02.449 --> 18:06.085
But--but you live with that
for 20 years or more...

18:10.523 --> 18:12.159
- I'm sorry.

18:13.660 --> 18:17.096
It ain't your fault.

18:19.866 --> 18:22.169
But sometimes, man,

18:22.202 --> 18:24.771
I fucking hated you.

18:24.804 --> 18:27.073
Just the sight of you.

18:27.106 --> 18:30.177
It would be a reminder
that I'm some kind of fucking--

18:30.210 --> 18:31.911
you know, some idiot.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.713
A fucking mistake.

18:39.619 --> 18:42.155
- Angel, nobody
ever thought that.

18:44.857 --> 18:46.293
- Poor little Angel.

18:46.326 --> 18:48.395
Nobody loved him.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.943
These are for his kills, right?

19:03.976 --> 19:05.512
The smiley faces?

19:05.545 --> 19:07.180
- Yeah.

19:09.182 --> 19:11.818
- Which one
you think was Mom?

19:21.694 --> 19:22.962
- Your pick.

19:58.431 --> 19:59.699
- I'll run some errands.

19:59.732 --> 20:01.000
It's a double session,
so I'll pick you up

20:01.033 --> 20:02.702
in an hour, hour 15?

20:02.735 --> 20:04.737
- Perfect.

20:10.943 --> 20:12.412
- Watch the exits.

20:12.445 --> 20:14.080
Please don't let her
slip away this time.

20:14.113 --> 20:15.348
- Yep.

20:28.295 --> 20:31.063
- All right?
-  Yeah, that hurts.

20:31.097 --> 20:33.566
Ow! Shit.
- My bad.

20:34.901 --> 20:37.136
- Heard about Medina.

20:37.169 --> 20:38.771
My condolences.

20:38.805 --> 20:41.441
- Thanks, man.
- Does he need a doc?

20:41.474 --> 20:43.643
- Nah, we'll get him home.

20:43.676 --> 20:45.244
We got one
that can sew him up there.

20:45.278 --> 20:46.946
- What do you know
about this club?

20:46.979 --> 20:48.715
- Swole Boys?

20:48.748 --> 20:51.551
They're out of a gym
on the Southside.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.052
They run the club from there.

20:53.085 --> 20:55.422
Grease monkeys, muscle heads.

20:55.455 --> 20:57.390
As far as we knew,
they weren't outlaw.

20:57.424 --> 20:59.392
- They got
an outlaw problem.

20:59.426 --> 21:01.928
- Yeah, they do.

21:01.961 --> 21:04.464
I'm sorry this went down
on my turf, brother.

21:05.332 --> 21:07.400
- We got shit to settle.

21:07.434 --> 21:09.235
You can be a part of it or not.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.438
Yeah.

21:11.471 --> 21:14.240
Let's go burn down
a fucking gym.

21:16.676 --> 21:19.446
White guys, huh?

21:19.479 --> 21:21.614
Yeah.

21:27.620 --> 21:30.657
- Hi, you must be Dita.
- Yes.

21:30.690 --> 21:32.425
Oh, that's not necessary.

21:32.459 --> 21:34.361
This session is how much?

21:34.394 --> 21:35.528
- We can discuss
all that later.

21:35.562 --> 21:36.996
- Answer the question, please.

21:38.164 --> 21:39.599
- My rate is $225,

21:39.632 --> 21:41.100
but the billing's
already been taken care of.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.969
- That's $2,000.

21:44.471 --> 21:46.038
- This isn't the way
we do this.

21:46.072 --> 21:49.008
- I'll tell you how we're
going to do this, Dr. Luna.

21:49.041 --> 21:52.512
My son and his
demonio blanco of a wife

21:52.545 --> 21:54.447
think that this is a good idea.

21:54.481 --> 21:56.282
I can assure you, it's not.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.551
You'll get that from me
every week

21:58.585 --> 22:00.019
and you can still bill my son.

22:00.052 --> 22:03.656
- But I don't--
- Yes, I'm paying you to lie.

22:03.690 --> 22:07.394
If anyone asks, I was here
and I'm making progress.

22:07.427 --> 22:09.896
- I can't do that.
- Oh, I think you can.

22:09.929 --> 22:13.065
And if you don't, I'll tell
my son you're a quack.

22:13.099 --> 22:14.534
He'll have you kicked out
of the building,

22:14.567 --> 22:16.235
ruin your reputation,

22:16.268 --> 22:20.373
and then this cushy little
"tell me your feelings" scam

22:20.407 --> 22:22.308
goes away for good.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.411
Don't analyze, sweetheart.

22:24.444 --> 22:26.012
It's a win-win.

22:46.733 --> 22:49.235
His phone keeps blowing up.

22:49.268 --> 22:50.570
- I know.

22:50.603 --> 22:51.438
- Someone's gonna come
looking for him.

22:51.471 --> 22:53.706
- I know.

22:56.208 --> 22:59.011
Fuck.

23:00.547 --> 23:01.781
I'm sorry, man.
This was stupid.

23:01.814 --> 23:03.015
I don't know
why I thought that--

23:03.049 --> 23:05.117
- Hey, hey, hey.

23:05.151 --> 23:07.954
It was my idea to come here
and do it this way.

23:10.256 --> 23:12.358
This dude's just
a fucking stone.

23:16.929 --> 23:19.031
Shut the fuck up!

23:23.402 --> 23:25.071
- So now what?

23:26.473 --> 23:28.941
- He's right.

23:28.975 --> 23:31.410
It's gonna have to be
him or us.

23:31.444 --> 23:33.079
- Jesus.

23:34.413 --> 23:37.383
- Hey.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.586
We make it look
like a break-in.

23:41.988 --> 23:45.391
Gotta be hundreds of people
with a motive to kill this guy.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.159
Cops ain't gonna dig too deep.

23:50.697 --> 23:51.664
Hey.

23:52.932 --> 23:55.301
We get the guy
who pulled the trigger.

23:57.436 --> 24:00.239
Without ever knowing why.

24:00.272 --> 24:03.409
- Some shit, little brother,
we're not supposed to know.

24:09.015 --> 24:11.951
Hey, we'll go at him
one more time.

24:13.620 --> 24:15.187
Then we end it.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.141
- We're gonna kill you.

24:37.744 --> 24:40.513
Make it look like a break-in.

24:43.550 --> 24:45.685
We don't want that.

24:47.019 --> 24:47.987
All we want to know

24:48.020 --> 24:50.523
is who paid you
to kill our mother.

24:53.660 --> 24:55.862
It was over nine years ago.

24:55.895 --> 24:57.964
It doesn't make you a snitch.

24:57.997 --> 25:00.700
It's our fucking mother.
- Who was it?

25:03.402 --> 25:05.237
Give us a name!

25:05.271 --> 25:08.040
- Who?

25:08.074 --> 25:09.576
- Who the fuck paid you?

25:12.579 --> 25:14.914
- Fuck that dog.

25:16.015 --> 25:17.316
- No!

25:19.251 --> 25:20.687
He's just hungry.

25:35.568 --> 25:39.538
- I'll blow off his legs
one at a time.

25:39.572 --> 25:42.341
Slice off his nose,
his fucking tail.

25:42.374 --> 25:45.277
Keep him alive as long as I can
so you can watch him suffer.

25:45.311 --> 25:48.414
- Just tell us.

25:50.917 --> 25:52.752
Please.

26:19.746 --> 26:21.948
- How are you holding up?

26:25.752 --> 26:27.720
- We'll figure this out.

26:27.754 --> 26:29.922
Montserrat's connection's
go deep.

26:31.858 --> 26:34.293
- I mean with all of it.

26:34.326 --> 26:36.262
Juggling both worlds.

26:40.599 --> 26:43.803
- If I'm being
completely honest, uh...

26:43.836 --> 26:46.505
I guess I'm enjoying it.

26:46.538 --> 26:48.808
Profits are up.

26:48.841 --> 26:52.979
I feel like I'm able
to give something back.

26:53.012 --> 26:56.082
And fucking over the DOJ?

26:56.115 --> 26:58.417
Well...

26:58.450 --> 27:01.954
that's, uh, my family's payback
for what they did to my father.

27:03.622 --> 27:05.624
- And your wife?

27:05.658 --> 27:07.593
Is she enjoying it?
- Emily?

27:07.626 --> 27:09.962
Yeah, of course.
She's fine.

27:11.864 --> 27:13.933
Why?

27:13.966 --> 27:16.368
- You went to school
in America.

27:16.402 --> 27:20.539
Set up your business there,
married an American.

27:20.572 --> 27:22.474
There's a reason

27:22.508 --> 27:24.977
your life is on the other side
of the fence.

27:26.178 --> 27:29.181
Over there,
you're Miguel Galindo,

27:29.215 --> 27:32.484
venture capitalist
and family man.

27:32.518 --> 27:35.988
On this side...

27:36.022 --> 27:38.490
you're Jose Galindo's son,

27:38.524 --> 27:40.960
head of a drug cartel.

27:40.993 --> 27:43.963
Every time
you cross that border,

27:43.996 --> 27:46.632
your wife loses
a little piece of you.

27:46.665 --> 27:48.634
- That's not true.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.669
All the shit
we've been through--

27:50.703 --> 27:53.639
the shit you put us through...

27:53.672 --> 27:55.908
Emily's strong.

27:55.942 --> 27:58.845
She knows what we have
can't be broken.

28:15.962 --> 28:17.096
- I don't think
she needs to hear

28:17.129 --> 28:19.832
your uplifting
marriage insight.

28:23.102 --> 28:24.670
Sí.

28:32.478 --> 28:34.213
Gracias.

28:52.965 --> 28:54.400
- Tell them
first-class airfare,

28:54.433 --> 28:56.735
hotel, per diem, usual shit.

28:56.769 --> 28:58.938
- It's gonna be cold as fuck
in the Urals.

28:58.971 --> 29:01.473
- Yeah, they'll need to supply
weather gear as well.

29:04.410 --> 29:07.046
Get the drop dead dates.
- Hobart, check this out.

29:07.079 --> 29:08.747
Just fired up
the, uh, GPS grid,

29:08.781 --> 29:10.817
and it looks like one
of our trackers is on the move.

29:10.850 --> 29:12.484
- Who?

29:12.518 --> 29:15.287
- It is the Bronco.

29:15.321 --> 29:18.290
The one that Galindo
and the M.C. use.

29:18.324 --> 29:19.792
- H-trade?

29:20.759 --> 29:22.728
- I don't think so.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.831
Galindo's world is southeast.

29:24.864 --> 29:27.934
This blip, it's on the 20
and it's heading west.

29:27.967 --> 29:29.902
- How long to intercept?

29:29.936 --> 29:31.737
- They keep moving
at this speed, hour 30,

29:31.770 --> 29:32.738
maybe less.

29:36.508 --> 29:38.644
Put the Jared thing on hold.

29:38.677 --> 29:40.079
- All right.

29:40.112 --> 29:41.948
- We're on the move.

29:53.860 --> 29:55.962
- Did you find it?

29:55.995 --> 29:59.331
- Think so.

29:59.365 --> 30:01.633
- That's it.

30:01.667 --> 30:04.703
It's towards the bottom.
An old fax.

30:11.677 --> 30:13.846
- Fuck.
- Jesus.

30:13.880 --> 30:16.015
- Look at the next page.

30:24.356 --> 30:25.557
- Pop.

30:25.591 --> 30:27.793
- I fucked up.

30:27.826 --> 30:30.329
I was supposed
to kill both of them.

30:39.171 --> 30:42.074
- The job came in
through Packer.

30:42.108 --> 30:44.010
- San Bernardino?

30:44.043 --> 30:47.413
- Yeah, closest charter
to the border.

30:47.446 --> 30:49.148
- It came from Mexico.

30:49.181 --> 30:52.151
- Yeah, that's all I knew.

30:52.184 --> 30:54.186
Packer might have
more details.

30:54.220 --> 30:56.855
He's anal
about keeping records.

30:56.889 --> 30:59.358
But he won't have a name.

30:59.391 --> 31:01.093
Don't work that way.

31:08.734 --> 31:10.769
- Tell us what happened.

31:12.939 --> 31:15.574
- Tell us.

31:15.607 --> 31:17.376
- I came in the back.

31:17.409 --> 31:19.111
Shop was closed.

31:19.145 --> 31:21.413
It was just your mom.

31:21.447 --> 31:24.516
Your old man must have left
a few minutes before.

31:24.550 --> 31:26.852
- Bank deposits.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.854
- Your mom...

31:28.887 --> 31:30.923
she wasn't surprised.

31:30.957 --> 31:32.624
- What do you mean?

31:32.658 --> 31:34.961
- I've killed a lot of people.

31:34.994 --> 31:36.362
Some of them,

31:36.395 --> 31:39.231
you can feel
the inevitability.

31:40.066 --> 31:42.101
They know it's coming.

31:42.134 --> 31:43.702
Your mom knew.

31:47.673 --> 31:50.042
I heard cars pulling up.

31:50.076 --> 31:53.412
I shot her in the neck and ran.

32:01.120 --> 32:02.754
After that,

32:02.788 --> 32:06.058
I hung out near the border

32:06.092 --> 32:08.094
waiting to hear
if I should finish the job.

32:08.127 --> 32:10.429
It was coming from Mexico.

32:10.462 --> 32:13.499
I figured it was
one of the cartels.

32:13.532 --> 32:15.067
That night you chased me?

32:16.935 --> 32:19.005
I thought that's who you were--

32:19.038 --> 32:22.308
cleanup guy for the cartel.

32:22.341 --> 32:25.077
I got spooked.

32:25.111 --> 32:28.414
Didn't feel safe
riding Nomad anymore.

32:28.447 --> 32:30.816
That's when I went
to Charming,

32:30.849 --> 32:32.018
patched in to Sam Crow.

32:39.191 --> 32:40.859
If someone killed my mom,

32:40.892 --> 32:43.495
I'd put a bullet
between his eyes.

33:03.349 --> 33:07.553
- I guess a coffee shop
would be...too obvious.

33:08.754 --> 33:11.690
- My family insists
that I never be left alone.

33:11.723 --> 33:13.959
They think I'm at the doctor.

33:13.992 --> 33:15.594
This building.

33:17.196 --> 33:18.997
Thank you for coming.

33:20.999 --> 33:25.137
- I got a visit from your son's
consejero the other day.

33:25.171 --> 33:27.673
- I hope Mr. Alvarez
was not too unpleasant.

33:27.706 --> 33:29.375
- No.

33:31.043 --> 33:34.046
He gave me a warning...

33:34.080 --> 33:36.082
not to do this.

33:37.349 --> 33:39.618
- May I tell you a secret?

33:41.687 --> 33:44.356
The reason my family
won't leave me alone

33:44.390 --> 33:47.626
is that they're afraid
I might try and hurt myself.

33:49.428 --> 33:52.531
The doctor
in this building is...

33:52.564 --> 33:54.766
is a shrink.

33:57.103 --> 33:59.705
The fire.

33:59.738 --> 34:01.540
- At the house?

34:03.041 --> 34:05.111
- I was home alone.

34:06.778 --> 34:08.780
I saw that...

34:08.814 --> 34:12.651
beautiful, fierce blaze
coming up over the hill.

34:14.486 --> 34:16.088
It was amazing.

34:17.323 --> 34:19.725
I felt like it was coming
for me, Ignacio.

34:21.059 --> 34:23.162
- Jesus Christ.

34:26.798 --> 34:28.567
- I had nothing left.

34:30.001 --> 34:32.471
I ignored the evacuations.

34:33.805 --> 34:35.107
I hid in the wine cellar

34:35.141 --> 34:37.276
when Miguel's men
came looking for me.

34:39.278 --> 34:41.913
Couldn't really
feel the heat.

34:41.947 --> 34:44.150
I must have been in shock
by then.

34:46.952 --> 34:49.921
There was a firefighter...

34:49.955 --> 34:52.924
a young Mexican man,

34:52.958 --> 34:55.261
looked like he was about 15.

34:56.428 --> 34:58.764
He pulled me out of the flames.

35:03.269 --> 35:05.471
- I'm sorry.

35:05.504 --> 35:06.805
- I'm not.

35:08.440 --> 35:10.242
I realized that
the reason I was saved

35:10.276 --> 35:13.111
is because I still have things
I need to do.

35:13.712 --> 35:16.448
- I guess I'm one
of those things, huh?

35:17.849 --> 35:22.120
- I never did a paternity
or a DNA test on Miguel.

35:24.122 --> 35:25.791
I didn't have to.

35:27.459 --> 35:30.329
I knew he was your son.

35:32.331 --> 35:34.466
- Jesus, Dita.

35:35.801 --> 35:37.203
What?

35:41.373 --> 35:43.942
Does anyone else know?

35:43.975 --> 35:46.212
- No, of course not.

35:47.879 --> 35:50.216
And no one ever will.

35:53.319 --> 35:56.555
Oh, session's over.

35:57.889 --> 35:59.858
We'll do this again.

36:06.332 --> 36:08.434
- Can't fucking wait.

36:23.048 --> 36:24.483
- Someone get the prez.

36:24.516 --> 36:26.818
- Hey, check this out.

36:26.852 --> 36:28.887
- Hey, get the prez.

36:47.739 --> 36:48.774
- This your crew?

36:51.042 --> 36:52.678
- Yeah.

36:52.711 --> 36:54.680
And I'd advise you
to get off our turf.

36:56.114 --> 36:58.617
- The fuck's wrong with you?

36:58.650 --> 37:01.353
You know I got a gun
in my kutte, right?

37:01.387 --> 37:03.021
That little chase game today
could have ended

37:03.054 --> 37:05.557
with us blowing your club
to fucking pieces.

37:05.591 --> 37:07.025
- Yeah.

37:07.058 --> 37:10.429
- You gotta stop watching
"West Side Story," man.

37:10.462 --> 37:11.730
It's gonna get you killed.

37:11.763 --> 37:13.131
- It was payback.

37:13.164 --> 37:14.733
- So you said.

37:14.766 --> 37:16.134
For what?

37:22.073 --> 37:23.775
- They're not here.

37:26.244 --> 37:29.481
Two of your guys last week...

37:29.515 --> 37:33.051
threw shots, started shit.

37:33.084 --> 37:34.886
Never got finished.

37:34.920 --> 37:37.055
- Fucking Angel.

37:37.088 --> 37:38.557
- And the prospect.

37:50.101 --> 37:51.470
- Fellas.

37:54.873 --> 37:57.476
- Two of our guys rode through
a few days back,

37:57.509 --> 37:59.077
apparently lit the fuse.

37:59.110 --> 38:01.913
Sorry, I didn't know.

38:01.947 --> 38:05.984
- You just lost a brother.
You had real shit to deal with.

38:06.017 --> 38:07.986
- Look, we'll handle our side,

38:08.019 --> 38:10.255
and we got your back
on whatever you wanna do here.

38:10.288 --> 38:11.357
- We're standing
right here, man.

38:11.390 --> 38:13.759
- Hey.

38:16.462 --> 38:18.364
- Get him.

38:23.635 --> 38:25.804
Maybe you wanna have
a little sit-down

38:25.837 --> 38:28.340
with these
motorcycle enthusiasts,

38:28.374 --> 38:30.476
tell them how shit goes down
in Berdoo.

38:30.509 --> 38:32.844
- I just might do that.

38:32.878 --> 38:35.381
Little lower education
never hurt anyone.

38:37.349 --> 38:38.650
- What the fuck does that mean?

38:38.684 --> 38:40.452
- You know, maybe it's just
the juice talking,

38:40.486 --> 38:41.887
but I kinda like this kid.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.321
- Yeah, he's dumber
than a pile of hair,

38:43.355 --> 38:44.823
but he's got balls.

38:49.661 --> 38:51.497
- Any idea
who ran you off the road?

38:52.364 --> 38:54.332
- With those fucking helmets?

38:55.701 --> 38:58.537
Who knows?
- Plus, he's wasted on Oxy.

38:58.570 --> 39:01.740
- Yeah, that too.

39:01.773 --> 39:02.841
- Ah, fuck!

39:02.874 --> 39:04.376
- That'll do.
- Hey, hey.

39:04.410 --> 39:06.478
Hey.
- Whoa.

39:06.512 --> 39:08.313
- Everybody relax.

39:08.346 --> 39:11.750
Shit.

39:13.519 --> 39:16.021
- This was just tit for tat.

39:16.054 --> 39:20.358
You should take
your guy inside, call 911.

39:20.392 --> 39:22.528
Tell them it was an accident.

39:22.561 --> 39:24.362
- You be smart here.

39:24.396 --> 39:27.332
We'll come back
and work things out.

39:27.365 --> 39:29.067
You got my word.

39:32.738 --> 39:34.740
- Get him inside.
- Fuck.

39:38.043 --> 39:39.445
Fuck.

39:49.320 --> 39:51.457
- Swole Boys.

39:51.490 --> 39:53.058
- Fucking muscle heads.

39:54.626 --> 39:56.394
- Well, we seem
to make a lot of noise

39:56.428 --> 39:58.697
when we ride through
your town, brother.

39:58.730 --> 40:00.799
- Appreciate you
setting things off.

40:00.832 --> 40:02.734
Clearly, we weren't
paying enough attention

40:02.768 --> 40:04.470
to shit in our own backyard.

40:04.503 --> 40:06.371
- All good.

40:06.404 --> 40:07.839
Let us know
if you need anything.

40:12.578 --> 40:13.912
- See you, Packer.
- See you.

40:13.945 --> 40:15.113
- Take care, man.

40:18.116 --> 40:20.218
- Find Angel.

40:20.251 --> 40:23.421
- Yeah, okay.

41:13.371 --> 41:15.641
- Palomo's a half hour away.

41:15.674 --> 41:18.644
We should get you out
of the sun.

41:35.193 --> 41:36.294
-  His phone's dead.

41:37.596 --> 41:40.365
You trust this guy?

41:40.398 --> 41:41.466
If we cut him loose,
you don't think

41:41.499 --> 41:42.634
he puts a bullet in our heads?

41:42.668 --> 41:43.569
- He's got just as much
to lose.

41:43.602 --> 41:44.736
- Like what?

41:44.770 --> 41:46.504
His club knows
he was gun for hire.

41:46.538 --> 41:47.839
They helped set up the hits.

41:47.873 --> 41:49.307
- Then we tell Bishop
he killed our mom.

41:49.340 --> 41:50.642
- He won't give a shit.

41:50.676 --> 41:52.844
What Happy did was business.

41:52.878 --> 41:54.713
What we did was personal.

41:54.746 --> 41:56.047
We broke the rules.

41:56.081 --> 41:57.716
- Oh, fuck.

41:57.749 --> 41:59.551
Guess I didn't
think it through.

42:01.853 --> 42:03.789
You mean I didn't
think it through.

42:12.030 --> 42:14.165
- Angel!

42:14.199 --> 42:15.734
Angel!

42:15.767 --> 42:17.535
- EZ, I'm right here.

42:21.372 --> 42:24.242
- Happy, it's Hallorann.

42:24.275 --> 42:27.012
Hap!

42:27.045 --> 42:29.447
You all right, buddy?
- What are you gonna do, boys?

42:31.382 --> 42:33.418
- This is both of us.

42:33.451 --> 42:36.221
Whatever happens,
you and me.

42:36.254 --> 42:37.388
Yes?

42:37.422 --> 42:38.590
- Happy, let me in!

42:47.265 --> 42:49.067
- Happy!
- What's up?

42:50.602 --> 42:52.904
- What the fuck happened?

42:54.906 --> 42:57.709
Who the fuck did this?
- Relax.

42:57.743 --> 43:00.045
These guys saved my ass.

43:00.078 --> 43:01.813
After I split off
from you guys,

43:01.847 --> 43:03.715
I got clipped
by a logging truck

43:03.749 --> 43:05.383
near Lonny's Shell.

43:05.416 --> 43:06.618
Fucker kept on going.

43:06.652 --> 43:08.386
- Yeah, we were on our way
up north.

43:08.419 --> 43:10.421
Hopped off the Five to fuel up.

43:11.089 --> 43:13.091
Found him laying
in the fucking dirt.

43:13.925 --> 43:16.728
- Jesus Christ.

43:16.762 --> 43:18.897
I was calling you.

43:18.930 --> 43:21.599
- Been a little distracted.
- Yeah, no.

43:21.633 --> 43:23.001
Shit.

43:24.035 --> 43:27.105
You need anything?
What can I do?

43:29.374 --> 43:32.143
- Pick up the dog shit
in my backyard.

43:33.679 --> 43:35.046
- Yeah?

43:36.715 --> 43:38.850
Cool, I can do that.

43:54.866 --> 43:57.502
- I'll get whatever I can
from Packer.

43:57.535 --> 44:00.605
After that, we're clean.

44:30.535 --> 44:31.937
- Thank you.

44:35.506 --> 44:37.809
- How'd it go?

44:37.843 --> 44:40.078
- I like her.

44:40.111 --> 44:43.181
You're right, I think
she might be able to help.

44:43.214 --> 44:44.816
- I'm glad, Dita.

44:44.850 --> 44:46.885
I know it's not easy.

45:20.218 --> 45:22.387
- What? How?

45:22.420 --> 45:23.521
- They must have tracked us.

45:36.567 --> 45:38.403
- No. No, no, no, no, no.

45:38.436 --> 45:40.038
No, no, Adelita!

45:40.071 --> 45:42.273
- Let's go, come on.
Let's go!

46:23.448 --> 46:25.917
- Go.

46:25.951 --> 46:27.252
What the fuck's going on?

46:27.285 --> 46:30.355
- We got a tip
Adelita was hiding here

46:30.388 --> 46:31.990
in the village.

46:32.023 --> 46:33.458
- She's inside?

46:33.491 --> 46:34.826
- Yeah.

46:34.860 --> 46:36.261
Alvarez is too.

46:36.294 --> 46:38.429
- Queen bee's inside,
gentlemen.

46:48.974 --> 46:50.775
- Clear! It's clear!

46:55.513 --> 46:57.348
Coming out.

47:14.432 --> 47:16.334
- Dead rebels.

47:24.109 --> 47:26.477
- We've been looking for you,
señorita.

47:38.623 --> 47:40.125
- Come on.

47:41.259 --> 47:43.261
- She doesn't like us
very much.

47:43.294 --> 47:46.464
Call Potter.
Let him know the job's done.

50:41.706 --> 50:43.508
- What are you looking at?

50:46.111 --> 50:48.679
- Inevitability.

52:00.318 --> 52:02.653
(hard rock music plays)

52:08.025 --> 52:10.027
(rock music continues)

52:15.032 --> 52:16.234
(motor revs)

52:24.175 --> 52:25.376
(hissing)

52:25.410 --> 52:27.312
ANNOUNCER: Mayans.

52:27.345 --> 52:30.147
All new Tuesdays at 10:00 on FX.

52:31.349 --> 52:33.117
(chattering)

52:33.150 --> 52:35.420
(breathing heavily)

52:41.091 --> 52:42.527
(screaming)

52:42.560 --> 52:44.362
ANNOUNCER: AHS 1984.

52:44.395 --> 52:46.163
Wednesdays at 10:00 on FX.

52:47.598 --> 52:50.134
I'm gonna have to get that
to you on Wednesday.

52:50.167 --> 52:51.536
Said you'd have
the money, man.

52:51.569 --> 52:54.038
No, I know I did.
I'm definitely gonna
have it by Wednesday.

52:54.071 --> 52:55.072
Definitely.

52:56.741 --> 52:58.543
I'm gonna have to
give you a touch-up.

52:58.576 --> 53:00.911
What? Well, can it
not be the face?

53:00.945 --> 53:02.680
-It's gotta be the face.
-Why?

53:02.713 --> 53:04.649
It's gotta be somewhere
where people can see it.

53:04.682 --> 53:07.184
-Now, don't flinch, yeah?
-WOMAN: Jason?

53:07.218 --> 53:09.920
Whoa, whoa. Mate, mate.
It's just my mum.

53:09.954 --> 53:12.022
-Hi. I'm Lorraine.
-Nice to meet ya.

53:18.596 --> 53:20.231
-(recorder playing theme song)
-(babbling)

53:20.265 --> 53:21.266
Pink eye!

53:23.033 --> 53:25.736
(grunting)

53:25.770 --> 53:27.772
(babbling)

53:28.539 --> 53:29.907
Pink eye!

53:29.940 --> 53:32.109
FRANK: Don't judge me!
This is art!

53:32.142 --> 53:33.143
(recorder hits sour note)

53:34.412 --> 53:36.547
(up-tempo music plays)

53:39.083 --> 53:40.951
-(man groaning)
-WOMAN: Oh, my God.

53:40.985 --> 53:42.953
Look at these
hardwood floors.

53:42.987 --> 53:44.589
(music resumes)
