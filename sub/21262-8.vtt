00:09.209 --> 00:10.810
You know,
maybe the wizard prince

00:10.877 --> 00:13.213
should like Lilac
for who she really is,

00:13.279 --> 00:15.348

00:19.319 --> 00:21.588
I think if I had
the Ring of Infinity,

00:21.654 --> 00:24.824
I'd want to use it to help other
people, not just myself.

00:24.891 --> 00:28.628

If we thought for a moment

01:19.712 --> 01:21.815

01:21.881 --> 01:23.850

a serial killer without parents,

We don't get to sleep
with other people.

01:36.496 --> 01:37.831

01:43.736 --> 01:45.738

I am very glad

07:46.432 --> 07:48.434
I'm sorry. I know. You're right.

07:48.501 --> 07:49.735
We have to know
what we're facing.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.070
What we're facing?

07:51.137 --> 07:53.206
I care, but I'm not going
to act like a maniac.

07:53.272 --> 07:54.907
You wore a dress.

07:54.974 --> 07:56.576
ANDREA:
Now you're just being mean.

07:56.642 --> 07:58.878
Come on, this is not--

07:56.642 --> 07:58.878
Mommy, this is my friend Zack.

07:58.945 --> 08:00.847
He also likes volcanoes.

08:00.913 --> 08:03.850
Ah, very cool.
Hey, Zack.

08:03.916 --> 08:06.185
His mommy
is a veterinarian.

08:06.252 --> 08:08.921
We love animals.
That's a cool job she's got.

08:08.988 --> 08:11.090
My mommy's a writer.

08:11.157 --> 08:13.226
That's right. She's a writer.

08:11.157 --> 08:13.226
That's what I do.

08:13.292 --> 08:15.161
Miss Jocelyn,
what do you do?

08:15.228 --> 08:18.431
Oh, my job is being
Olive's mommy.

08:18.497 --> 08:21.200
That's not enough.
What else do you do?

08:23.669 --> 08:27.807
Well, that is more
than enough.

08:27.874 --> 08:30.576
And being a mommy is important,

08:30.643 --> 08:33.746
and also the hardest job
in the entire world.

08:33.813 --> 08:35.848
So that's a big job.

08:35.915 --> 08:39.352
But, Mommy, you said
you have to find passion

08:39.418 --> 08:40.486
and get a real job.

08:43.222 --> 08:46.859
Uh-huh. But that was in
a very specific context.

08:46.926 --> 08:48.794
I think it's important
to be a mom.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.269
I literally cannot
get Amelia's

08:56.335 --> 08:59.472
"that's not enough"
to Jocelyn out of my head.

08:59.538 --> 09:01.474
Yeah, but you said Jocelyn
was cool with it, right?

09:01.540 --> 09:04.710
I apologized profusely.
She seemed okay.

09:04.777 --> 09:06.679
I told her it was coming off
the counter-programming

09:06.746 --> 09:08.247
of the princess stuff.

09:08.314 --> 09:09.949
But it was hard to watch.

09:10.016 --> 09:11.951
Yeah, I mean, I know
that it didn't sound great

09:12.018 --> 09:13.886
when Amelia said it out loud,
but that's kind of

09:13.953 --> 09:15.221
what we're teaching her,
right?

09:15.288 --> 09:18.524
No! Not to judge
other women's choices.

09:18.591 --> 09:19.992
Yes, to be a strong female.

09:20.059 --> 09:22.061
I mean, if Amelia wanted
to be a stay-at-home mom,

09:22.128 --> 09:23.429
I would be fine with that.

09:23.496 --> 09:24.797
Really?

09:24.864 --> 09:26.465
Yeah, if she got
an education first

09:26.532 --> 09:28.668
and knew that she could do
anything she wanted.

09:28.734 --> 09:30.937
Because then she would have
something to fall back on

09:31.003 --> 09:34.240
in case something unforeseen
happened in her relationship.

09:34.307 --> 09:35.241
True. True.

09:35.308 --> 09:36.442
I mean...

09:36.509 --> 09:37.710
we wouldn't want her
to be stuck

09:37.777 --> 09:40.513
in some shit-dog marriage
just because she decided

09:40.579 --> 09:43.382
to leave the work force
for so long.

09:43.449 --> 09:45.351
That's a lot of nuance
for a 5-year-old.

09:45.418 --> 09:48.354
Who the fuck knows? I just
want my daughter to have options

09:48.421 --> 09:49.922
and be open to other women's
choices.

09:49.989 --> 09:51.657
I totally agree.

09:51.724 --> 09:53.326
Maybe I've over-corrected.

09:53.392 --> 09:55.494
On another note, though,

09:55.561 --> 09:56.762
I really liked
that school today.

09:56.829 --> 09:58.931
And I am extremely
comfortable

09:58.998 --> 10:00.466
thinking that our child
could be

10:00.533 --> 10:02.301
in Ralph Macchio's
capable hands.

10:02.368 --> 10:05.471
I would personally prefer
his cousin Vinny.

10:05.538 --> 10:07.506
You think maybe
you were just excited

10:07.573 --> 10:10.476
that you thought of another
Ralph Macchio movie?

10:10.543 --> 10:12.411
I was. Yeah.

10:10.543 --> 10:12.411
How about...

10:12.478 --> 10:14.814
I will let you kiss me
for five seconds

10:14.880 --> 10:17.216
if you can think of another
Ralph Macchio movie

10:17.283 --> 10:18.451
by the time
I count to three.

10:18.517 --> 10:20.453

10:20.519 --> 10:21.620
All right.

10:27.493 --> 10:29.295
You're not
kissing me back.

10:29.362 --> 10:30.496
I said that you can kiss me.

10:30.563 --> 10:31.931
I didn't say I was going
to kiss you.

10:31.998 --> 10:33.933
Go ahead. You still have
a couple seconds left.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.434
This is weird.

10:38.838 --> 10:40.506
All right.

10:40.573 --> 10:42.375
All right, that was it.

10:42.441 --> 10:43.609
You got it.

10:45.611 --> 10:47.380
That was fun for...

10:45.611 --> 10:47.380
That was fun .

Mommy, who's the princess
you like the most?

11:24.216 --> 11:26.318
Well, you know,
I like Belle.

11:26.385 --> 11:27.953
Because she likes books.

11:28.020 --> 11:31.190
Right. That's true.

11:31.257 --> 11:33.893
But maybe I've overlooked
the charms

11:33.959 --> 11:37.129
of some of the other
cool princesses.

11:37.196 --> 11:38.798
I like the Little Mermaid.

11:38.864 --> 11:41.901
Uh-huh. Well, you know,
I like Ariel too.

11:41.967 --> 11:46.072
I mean, she gave up her voice
to be with a man

11:46.138 --> 11:47.540
that she just met, so...

11:47.606 --> 11:51.277
She's the prettiest one,
so she doesn't need a voice.

11:51.343 --> 11:52.745
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

11:52.812 --> 11:56.582
Well, I don't think
it's because she's pretty

11:56.649 --> 11:58.751
that she doesn't
need a voice.

11:58.818 --> 12:01.587
I think that's just something
that she decided

12:01.654 --> 12:05.191
wasn't important to her
at that moment.

12:11.864 --> 12:14.233
You know, girls don't have
to save the world.

12:14.300 --> 12:16.202
Only if they choose to,
you know.

12:16.268 --> 12:17.803
Although,
let's be honest.

12:17.870 --> 12:20.039
Even if they choose to, they'll
probably be told they can't.

Actually, Caroline's
not here either.

12:39.692 --> 12:41.460

had one, so...

Oh, yeah, sure. Several.

13:08.821 --> 13:12.658

of sangria before she left.

You want some?

13:13.926 --> 13:15.961
Um...sure. Of course.

for a while,

15:54.453 --> 15:56.522
your body really adjusts.

you get used to it.

Yeah.
We keep it kind of cold.

16:01.160 --> 16:03.295
Mommy, you guys hold hands
and make a bridge,

16:03.362 --> 16:05.197
and we'll swim under.

16:05.264 --> 16:08.600
Oh...no, no. I don't think
we need to make a bridge.

16:08.667 --> 16:10.102
You guys do something.

16:10.169 --> 16:12.471
Yeah. You know what? Why don't
you guys do butt bumpers?

Yeah!

What's butt bumpers?

the other person's hands,

16:16.608 --> 16:17.776
and you press your feet
together,

16:17.843 --> 16:18.977
and then you
bump butts.

very easy.

Why don't you and I show her.

16:27.419 --> 16:30.322
No, that won't work.
You have to be the same size.

16:30.389 --> 16:31.990

16:32.057 --> 16:34.727
Um, do you mind?

16:34.793 --> 16:37.162
Of course. Yeah, yeah.

16:38.430 --> 16:39.531
Uh...

16:40.799 --> 16:42.768
It's very simple.
You...

16:42.835 --> 16:45.237
You hold hands.

16:45.304 --> 16:48.707
And then you put the bottoms
of your feet together.

16:50.142 --> 16:52.378
And then you...

16:52.444 --> 16:54.012
you bump butts,
like this.

17:07.226 --> 17:09.061
So Ben and I have officially
touched butts.

17:09.128 --> 17:10.462
You know, in some
cultures that means

17:10.529 --> 17:12.131
that I may have a baby
inside me.

17:12.197 --> 17:15.701
So we may be sharing a child
with this other family.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.202
I am so sorry I missed it.

17:17.269 --> 17:18.404
Shut up.

17:18.470 --> 17:20.305
I thought you were going
to be there longer.

17:20.372 --> 17:24.376
Well, I think after the ass play
we felt very comfortable

17:24.443 --> 17:25.611
calling the playdate.

17:25.677 --> 17:27.179
Ass play?

17:27.246 --> 17:29.381
Aren't you maybe blowing this
out of proportion a little bit?

17:29.448 --> 17:31.350
No.

17:29.448 --> 17:31.350
I mean, it was just a pool game.

17:31.417 --> 17:32.918
And you love Ben.
Yeah.

17:32.985 --> 17:34.787
But it is intimate to be
parenting with someone

17:34.853 --> 17:37.523
other than your spouse
in their home.

17:37.589 --> 17:39.792
And then we're just looking
at each other's bodies.

17:39.858 --> 17:41.193
I mean, Ben's nipples.

17:41.260 --> 17:42.995
You checked out
Ben's nipples?

17:43.061 --> 17:45.197
Obviously. If someone's
nipples are out,

17:45.264 --> 17:47.599
in what scenario are you not
checking them out?

17:47.666 --> 17:49.902
And by the way, I recommend
if you're ever near him again,

17:49.968 --> 17:51.103
get a real good look at them.

17:51.170 --> 17:53.005
They're stunning.

17:51.170 --> 17:53.005
Okay, yeah.

17:53.071 --> 17:55.040
But I mean, Ben would never
do anything inappropriate.

17:55.107 --> 17:56.775
No, no, no. Nobody did anything
inappropriate.

17:56.842 --> 17:59.478
This was not a sexually charged
atmosphere.

17:59.545 --> 18:00.712
Imagine you
and Caroline, okay?

18:00.779 --> 18:02.581
You're alone in her house.
You're boozing.

18:02.648 --> 18:04.450
You shimmy into a pool.

18:04.516 --> 18:07.886
You sort of accidentally
graze her wet skin.

18:07.953 --> 18:11.657
And then, for one
brief moment,

18:11.723 --> 18:15.461
her butt and your butt
become one.

18:18.063 --> 18:19.765
Okay, all right. I got it.

18:18.063 --> 18:19.765
Yeah. You get it?

18:19.832 --> 18:21.133
Yeah, okay.

18:21.200 --> 18:23.035
So are we never going
to see them again?

18:23.101 --> 18:24.770
No. We have another dinner.
I like them.

18:24.837 --> 18:27.206
I want to get through this.

18:24.837 --> 18:27.206
Okay. Good.

18:27.272 --> 18:29.007
Yeah. The good news is,

18:29.074 --> 18:30.609
I don't have to even wear
a top to dinner,

18:30.676 --> 18:33.579
because Ben has seen
everything.

18:33.645 --> 18:35.747
What bathing suit
did you wear?

18:35.814 --> 18:37.149
Oh, I took my top off.

18:37.216 --> 18:39.418
You know, it just seemed
like the right thing to do.

18:39.485 --> 18:42.521
It seemed sexier to be, like,
covering the important parts

18:42.588 --> 18:44.423
versus just, like,
taking it all off,

18:44.490 --> 18:45.824
and then it's just science.

18:45.891 --> 18:46.925
That was a smart play.

18:46.992 --> 18:48.193
It may have backfired

18:48.260 --> 18:49.928
when Ben got
his huge boner.

18:49.995 --> 18:51.463
But, you know...

18:49.995 --> 18:51.463
He didn't get a boner.

18:51.530 --> 18:52.764
Did he?

18:52.831 --> 18:54.800
Yup.

18:54.867 --> 18:57.069
Ben got a boner
and I took my top off.

18:57.135 --> 18:58.871
That's how the family
playdate ended.

18:58.937 --> 19:00.138
Now you know everything.

19:03.408 --> 19:05.077
Honey, I found these
in Amelia's room.

19:05.143 --> 19:06.845
Is it okay for her
to play with these?

19:06.912 --> 19:09.815
Yes. I'm trying to loosen up
a little bit.

19:09.882 --> 19:11.817
Oh, good.
You need it.

19:11.884 --> 19:13.752
Oh I'm so excited
to play with heels again.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.087
Mom, she can wear the heels,

19:15.153 --> 19:17.155
but only if she's going
to ask you about them.

19:17.222 --> 19:18.690
Don't push them on her.

19:17.222 --> 19:18.690
I'm not going--

19:18.757 --> 19:20.792
Just put them out.
Make them one of the choices.

19:20.859 --> 19:22.227
Okay?
Okay.

19:22.294 --> 19:24.963
To be clear, you are not going
to make the choice for her.

19:25.030 --> 19:27.299
And whatever choice she makes,
you can support the choice,

19:27.366 --> 19:29.167
but don't, like,
over-support the choice.

19:29.234 --> 19:30.869
She either wears heels
or she doesn't.

19:30.936 --> 19:32.137
It's a woman's choice.

19:32.204 --> 19:33.739
Okay, I don't have all day
to stand around

19:33.805 --> 19:35.107
and try to figure out
what you mean.

19:35.173 --> 19:37.009
I have to leave in ten minutes
to feed Leon.

19:37.075 --> 19:38.343
Mom...

19:37.075 --> 19:38.343
Oh!

19:38.410 --> 19:39.545
I'm going to grab a dress

19:39.611 --> 19:40.812
for her to put on
with the heels.

19:40.879 --> 19:42.180
Mom, you've got to stop
saying that.

19:42.247 --> 19:43.615
You're not feeding Leon.

19:43.682 --> 19:45.450
Okay, I'm not feeding him,

19:45.517 --> 19:47.653
but I am serving him
dinner in bed.

19:47.719 --> 19:49.655
I'm sorry, what?

19:49.721 --> 19:51.490
What? He likes
to be comfortable...

19:51.557 --> 19:54.860
and get in bed
and eat dinner.

19:54.927 --> 19:58.864
What are you serving him in bed?
Like sandwiches?

19:58.931 --> 20:02.234
No! Do I serve sandwiches
for dinner?

20:02.301 --> 20:06.505
No. Last night I made him
lamb chops and couscous.

20:06.572 --> 20:08.473
This is like...
this is like on a tray?

20:08.540 --> 20:11.677
There's no tray. He pulls up
a towel and eats on that.

20:11.743 --> 20:14.212
I mean, do you pull
the comforter down?

20:14.279 --> 20:15.814
You don't need to pull
the comforter down.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.182
You have the towel.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.182
Oh, of course.

20:17.249 --> 20:18.417
Because that would be crazy.

20:18.483 --> 20:21.253
You understand that this
sounds insane, right?

20:21.320 --> 20:23.555
What? I'm from another
generation, okay?

20:23.622 --> 20:26.358
What, like the pre-Confederacy
generation?

20:26.425 --> 20:28.727
You look very good for 136.

20:28.794 --> 20:30.462
It's like walking on eggshells
talking to you.

20:30.529 --> 20:31.597
Really?
Yes.

20:31.663 --> 20:33.332
Okay, well, I'd rather
walk on eggshells

20:33.398 --> 20:35.167
than turn over in the middle
of the night

20:35.233 --> 20:37.369
on top of old pieces
of lamb chops.

20:37.436 --> 20:39.738
Oh, no, no.
He loves my lamb chops.

20:39.805 --> 20:41.873
There's never any leftovers.

20:41.940 --> 20:44.743
That's unbelievably
not the point that I'm making.

20:44.810 --> 20:48.013
I have to say, Andrea,
I love that shirt.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.349
Oh, thank you.

20:50.415 --> 20:51.883
It's its first outing.

20:51.950 --> 20:54.186
She's coming out
to see the people.

20:54.252 --> 20:55.520
I could see you
rocking this shirt.

20:55.587 --> 20:57.089
Really?
Yeah, 100%.

20:57.155 --> 20:58.590
You think I could pull off
that blouse?

20:58.657 --> 21:00.158
Oh, uh...

21:00.225 --> 21:01.927
oh, um...

21:01.994 --> 21:03.629
all blouses
look good on you.

21:03.695 --> 21:06.531
That is true. They all do.

21:03.695 --> 21:06.531
Thanks. Okay.

21:06.598 --> 21:09.735
Oh, hey, before I forget,
we are going to Arrowhead

21:09.801 --> 21:11.536
over spring break,
so if you want to join us...

21:11.603 --> 21:13.005
Yeah. Yeah.
That sounds great.

21:13.071 --> 21:14.806
Right?

21:14.873 --> 21:16.675
It's gonna be fun.

21:14.873 --> 21:16.675
ANDREA: That'll be fun.

21:16.742 --> 21:18.010
Yeah. We're in.

21:18.076 --> 21:19.945
Thank you, by the way,
for thinking of us.

21:20.012 --> 21:21.680
You think there'll be snow
up there then?

21:21.747 --> 21:23.181
Hard to say.

21:23.248 --> 21:24.950
Hey, I just want
to apologize again

21:25.017 --> 21:27.019
about the whole playdate thing.

21:25.017 --> 21:27.019
Oh, don't apologize.

21:27.085 --> 21:28.220
Missing it.

21:28.286 --> 21:29.554
Well, no apology needed.

21:29.621 --> 21:31.623
And I promise, Ben and I are
going to power through this.

21:31.690 --> 21:33.325
It's not going to stay
awkward for long.

21:33.392 --> 21:35.227
What are you talking about?

21:35.293 --> 21:37.663
Oh, I...

21:37.729 --> 21:40.899
sorry, I just assumed
that Ben had told you that it

21:40.966 --> 21:45.370
kind of turned into a different
playdate the other day.

21:45.437 --> 21:47.139
I mean, you and Mike
suddenly weren't there.

21:47.205 --> 21:49.541
Then it was Ben and I alone.
You left sangrias.

21:49.608 --> 21:50.976
Then we're drinking
and then swimming.

21:51.043 --> 21:54.413
And the kids forced us
to touch our butts.

21:54.479 --> 21:56.148
Ben didn't mention
any of that.

21:56.214 --> 21:58.483
Well, I'll...

21:58.550 --> 21:59.851
I'll tell you...

21:59.918 --> 22:01.987
now I see-- I mean,
because it wasn't a big deal.

22:02.054 --> 22:03.755
I really was making
more of a joke about it

22:03.822 --> 22:05.123
more than anything.

22:05.190 --> 22:07.192
Anyway, it was just strange...

22:05.190 --> 22:07.192
You know what? Please.

22:07.259 --> 22:08.627
I get it. I got it.
Okay.

22:08.694 --> 22:11.129
I think I made it sound worse.

22:08.694 --> 22:11.129
Okay, it's fine.

22:11.196 --> 22:12.664
You guys know
what you're getting?

22:12.731 --> 22:15.267
I think we should do
family style here, right?

22:15.333 --> 22:17.602
Ben, how come you didn't tell me
about butt-bumping with Andrea

22:17.669 --> 22:19.604
alone in our pool?

22:19.671 --> 22:21.740
Oh, because, uh...

22:21.807 --> 22:23.608
because we weren't alone.
The kids were there.

22:23.675 --> 22:24.910
Yeah.

22:23.675 --> 22:24.910
I think it was more awkward

22:24.976 --> 22:26.478
than anything, right?

22:26.545 --> 22:27.479
Mike knows about this too?

22:27.546 --> 22:29.081
Oh! Only because
when I got home,

22:29.147 --> 22:31.116
I...he was there
and I was like,

22:31.183 --> 22:32.350
"Oh, this was funny."

22:32.417 --> 22:34.486
And, I mean,
let's be honest.

22:34.553 --> 22:37.322
Two adults who barely
know each other

22:37.389 --> 22:40.625
kind of slipping into a pool
touching bottoms

22:40.692 --> 22:43.428
is not totally normal.

22:43.495 --> 22:45.030
BEN:
It's unconventional.

22:45.097 --> 22:48.166
Negotiated a very steep price,
obviously.

22:48.233 --> 22:50.869
We did not do,
so no money changed hands.

22:50.936 --> 22:52.771
Kind of a missed opportunity,
maybe, a little bit.

22:52.838 --> 22:54.673
It's just a little weird.
It's fine. I get it.

22:54.740 --> 22:56.441
Okay.

Thank you.

So who do we think
that guy looks like?

23:06.985 --> 23:08.754
I don't think
he looks like anyone.

like anyone.
