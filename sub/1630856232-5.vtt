about it, though.

are doing, like, right now?

00:19.310 --> 00:20.729

Well, John's so smart
and now so competitive.
I know.

scheming something.

two steps ahead of them

in a meditation group,

this piece of property --

that I don't find accessible
in the rush of the city.

in Ann Arbor, Michigan,

till I was 5 years old.

11:25.477 --> 11:28.897

six countries I've lived in --

11:31.024 --> 11:33.026

I think with all the different
places that I've lived,

11:35.278 --> 11:38.406
all the people that I've met,
music is that base for me

all of us could connect.

singing in school assemblies,

[ Fast-forwarding]

19:10.984 --> 19:13.903
When I first started singing,
I was around 11.

19:13.945 --> 19:16.531
My parents always told me
that I could sing,

19:16.573 --> 19:18.658
so they pushed me
to do vocal lessons,

19:18.700 --> 19:20.702
and it all started to take off.

19:20.744 --> 19:22.912
I have spent most of my life
in Oklahoma,

19:22.954 --> 19:25.665
and there's a very, very nice
and humble music scene

19:25.707 --> 19:28.543
that let young artists sing
in their opries,

19:28.585 --> 19:30.628
and they let them play
with bands.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.297
And I started to get
really used to

19:32.339 --> 19:33.882
singing in front
of other people,

19:33.923 --> 19:36.009
and I started understanding
things about my own voice.

19:36.051 --> 19:40.472
I was like, "Okay, I guess
this is what I'm doing now."

* It's a beautiful life *

19:43.308 --> 19:44.976

As I was growing up,

19:47.437 --> 19:51.316
I found one audition for
this group called Acapop! KIDS.

19:51.358 --> 19:54.027
I auditioned for them thinking,
"Oh, there's no way."

19:54.069 --> 19:57.489
But I actually was in
a music video with them.

the craziest experience ever.

So, that got like
15 million views.

a really big thing."

between, like,

47:56.543 --> 47:58.128
Oh, my God.
Look at your beauty.

47:58.169 --> 47:59.796
I can't believe it.

47:59.838 --> 48:01.589
I don't know
if I would have got him

48:01.631 --> 48:03.591
if Reba hadn't blocked John,

48:03.633 --> 48:05.385
but lucky for me,
it worked out.

48:05.427 --> 48:07.804
Thank you for choosing me.
Thank you for choosing me!

48:07.846 --> 48:10.306
Brandon: I chose Gwen
because I believe

48:10.348 --> 48:12.851
that she can bring out
the artist in me

48:12.892 --> 48:15.645
and bring me out
of my shell completely.

48:15.687 --> 48:18.898
Reba: As soon as I heard him,
I knew Brandon --

48:18.940 --> 48:21.151
that's the one
John was wanting to go with.

48:21.192 --> 48:25.280
So that's why I blocked John.
Then he went with Gwen instead.

48:25.321 --> 48:27.657
I guess I kind of wasted
a block on John?

48:27.699 --> 48:29.492
I just want the audience
to know what happens

48:29.534 --> 48:30.994
when people block me.

48:31.036 --> 48:32.328
Niall blocked me.

48:32.370 --> 48:34.122
He did not win the artist
he blocked me for.

48:34.164 --> 48:37.500
Reba, she did not win
the artist she blocked me for.

48:37.542 --> 48:40.503
So the lesson is,
don't block me.

48:40.545 --> 48:41.838

It's time to go, y'all.

48:47.927 --> 48:49.554
Hee!

48:49.596 --> 48:52.724
First day to a new, beautiful,
life-changing chapter.

48:52.766 --> 48:54.267
I have no words.

48:54.309 --> 48:57.020
I am Peter Pinnock.
I am 27 years old.

48:57.062 --> 48:58.438
I am from Manatee County,
Florida,

48:58.480 --> 49:01.274
and I reside in Los Angeles,
California.

49:01.316 --> 49:02.609
I grew up with just my mom.

49:02.650 --> 49:04.194
It was really just us
against the world.

49:04.235 --> 49:06.237
But she's my hero, man,
for real.

49:06.279 --> 49:08.156
Marie: I realized Peter
could sing and dance

49:08.198 --> 49:09.908
at 1 years old
in the car seat,

49:09.949 --> 49:12.369
even if it was to
the windshield wipers.

49:12.410 --> 49:15.872
He had rhythm and was always
singing and dancing.

49:15.914 --> 49:17.374
It was rough growing up.

49:17.415 --> 49:19.292
My mom had me when she was 17,

49:19.334 --> 49:21.711
and not only was I a mixed kid,

49:21.753 --> 49:24.964
but I was a mixed kid
who was blind in one eye.

49:25.006 --> 49:29.719
Peter was 4
when he was shot in the eye

49:29.761 --> 49:31.388
with a homemade
bow and arrow.

49:31.429 --> 49:35.850
But his spirit,
it was honestly incredible.

49:35.892 --> 49:40.146
He had just came out
of surgery,

49:40.188 --> 49:43.274
and what comforted him
was music.

49:43.316 --> 49:45.235
I don't know
many 4-year-olds

49:45.276 --> 49:48.988
that could have handled this
trauma the way that he did.

49:49.030 --> 49:51.449
My mom put me
in my first tap jazz class

49:51.491 --> 49:53.243
when I was like
8 or 9 years old.

49:53.284 --> 49:55.370
And because of
the love of music,

49:55.412 --> 49:56.705
dance came so natural for me.

49:56.746 --> 49:58.748
So after high school,
I moved to LA

49:58.790 --> 50:00.709
to pursue dance
as a profession.

50:00.750 --> 50:02.752
I've gotten to work
with Megan Thee Stallion,

50:02.794 --> 50:06.006
Christina Aguilera,
The Weeknd, Snoop Dogg.

50:06.047 --> 50:07.590
And actually,
this is not the first time

50:07.632 --> 50:09.134
I stepped
on the "Voice" stage.

50:09.175 --> 50:11.928
I was able to perform
with Khalid back in 2019,

50:11.970 --> 50:14.431
but being on "The Voice"
as a singer

50:14.472 --> 50:15.765
and having this opportunity

50:15.807 --> 50:19.102
to step out of my norm
as a dancer

50:19.144 --> 50:20.478
is by far gonna be

50:20.520 --> 50:22.772
the biggest opportunity
I've had in my life.

50:22.814 --> 50:24.899
I am singing "Your Man"
by Josh Turner

50:24.941 --> 50:27.277

I dance as a hip-hop dancer,

50:34.159 --> 50:36.619

singing is country.

and where are you from?

My name is Peter Pinnock,

51:55.490 --> 51:57.158
and I am from
Manatee County, Florida.

51:57.200 --> 51:59.869
Well, you don't look
like your voice, first of all.

51:59.911 --> 52:01.538
I didn't know you were
gonna wear pink.

52:01.579 --> 52:03.623
Pink pants,
you did not expect.

52:03.665 --> 52:05.583
Gwen: I felt like as
the performance was going on,

52:05.625 --> 52:07.711
it was getting
a little bit more out of tune.

52:07.752 --> 52:09.879
Even though you have
that deep part of your voice,

52:09.921 --> 52:11.631
there is a nasal
kind of tone.

52:11.673 --> 52:13.842
Maybe just open up a little bit
to warm things up.

52:13.883 --> 52:15.635
But other than that,
I think that you should

52:15.677 --> 52:17.137
just go
with your character

52:17.178 --> 52:19.055
and that you're gonna
get somewhere with that.

52:19.097 --> 52:20.765
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

52:20.807 --> 52:22.517
You singing that low
consistently

52:22.559 --> 52:23.852
was pretty impressive,

52:23.893 --> 52:25.645
but I think everybody
probably notices

52:25.687 --> 52:27.772
you're not speaking
in the same accent

52:27.814 --> 52:30.025
you were singing in,
and because of that,

52:30.066 --> 52:33.611
it made it feel less, like,
connected to who you are.

52:33.653 --> 52:36.489
And that was a distraction
for me.
Got you.

52:36.531 --> 52:38.533
I was really surprised
when I turned around

52:38.575 --> 52:40.910
that you didn't have
a cowboy hat on

52:40.952 --> 52:42.412
because you
really sound like

52:42.454 --> 52:43.913
you're from the hills
of Tennessee.

52:43.955 --> 52:46.916
So, what genre of music
do you usually sing?

52:46.958 --> 52:49.627
I usually sing country and --
but a mix of country and R&B.

52:49.669 --> 52:51.796
I'm from Florida,
so I grew up in the South.

52:51.838 --> 52:54.049
I wish that, for you, that you'd
have chosen a different song

52:54.090 --> 52:56.593
that kind of showed more of
the R&B side of country music

52:56.634 --> 52:58.011
to show off
more of your tone.

52:58.053 --> 52:59.846

for coming down, man.

all of you guys' opinions.

it just wasn't quite there.

sort of selective

who I press for.

was here last year.

more passionate,

59:38.620 --> 59:41.247
when you speak,
has so much character.

59:41.289 --> 59:43.083
And in the song,
it did, as well.

59:43.124 --> 59:44.876

for a little bit

more character
at the right times.

I was like, "Oh, my gosh, Gwen.

You don't even know
what you're talking about."

and here we are.

You know, Al, I would
just be curious in the future,

59:55.261 --> 59:57.472

you and Reba would pick

59:57.514 --> 01:00:00.058
that would show
a little bit more dynamic,

01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:01.643
a little bit more range
in the future.

01:00:01.685 --> 01:00:04.729
Sure.
But the future is here
because you have a chance

01:00:04.771 --> 01:00:07.023
to do that with Reba now,
so that's very exciting.

believe it right now.

I'm doing a lot of songwriting

I do a lot of music there.
Yeah.

01:04:56.604 --> 01:04:59.733
So, currently I'm about to
graduate from Belmont University

with a degree in songwriting
and a minor in music business.

01:05:02.610 --> 01:05:04.863
I still do like to gig around
sometimes with my band,

01:05:04.904 --> 01:05:06.781
and we'll play
some of my original music

a few different covers.

I think it was in church,
actually.

My mom asked me
to sing with her on stage.

that I definitely come out
of my shell with music.

01:05:26.092 --> 01:05:29.804

a little bit turbulent.

Whenever things
were pretty stressful,

01:05:35.852 --> 01:05:37.771
I did start to lean
on music a lot more

01:05:37.812 --> 01:05:39.647
because that was
my safe space

01:05:39.689 --> 01:05:41.107

I could express

01:06:07.884 --> 01:06:09.761
and this big voice
comes out

01:06:09.803 --> 01:06:12.472
of a tiny little thing
like you.
Thank you.

01:06:12.514 --> 01:06:14.808
You've got
such a powerful voice.

01:06:14.849 --> 01:06:16.976
I turned for you because
I would love to be your coach.

01:06:17.018 --> 01:06:19.521
I think we could have
a lot of fun together

01:06:19.562 --> 01:06:22.524
and get to work
on some staging things.

01:06:22.565 --> 01:06:24.025
You have to communicate

01:06:24.067 --> 01:06:25.735
with your audience
to let them know

01:06:25.777 --> 01:06:28.655
that you're singing
to them, for them.

01:06:28.697 --> 01:06:30.031
So, I could help you out
with that.

01:06:30.073 --> 01:06:31.908
Thank you so much.

01:06:31.950 --> 01:06:32.951
Niall: Hello.

01:06:32.992 --> 01:06:35.078
It was just like
the mapping scenario

01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:37.122
where, like, you're making
your way through a song

01:06:37.163 --> 01:06:39.499
and I just wasn't sure where it
was -- where it was going.

01:06:39.541 --> 01:06:41.626
Yeah.
I think where we're at
in the competition now,

01:06:41.668 --> 01:06:43.128
the teams are starting
to fill up for us,

01:06:43.169 --> 01:06:46.006
and, like, I have to be
like absolutely 100% sure

01:06:46.047 --> 01:06:48.633
to turn around and go
and coach this person.
Yeah.

01:06:48.675 --> 01:06:50.010
But there's no doubt
you're in good hands

01:06:50.051 --> 01:06:52.887
either way,
with the queen or...
The Legend.

01:06:52.929 --> 01:06:54.639
...that guy there,
down there at the end.

01:06:54.681 --> 01:06:56.558
He's -- He's good.
He's alright, too, I suppose.

01:06:56.599 --> 01:06:57.851
Thank you so much.
Thank you, Elizabeth.

01:06:57.892 --> 01:06:59.269
Thank you.
Thank you.

01:06:59.310 --> 01:07:02.188
Gwen: You're so cute,
first of all.
Thank you.

01:07:02.230 --> 01:07:05.066
Your choices, the way that
you were scooping your vocals

01:07:05.108 --> 01:07:08.653
into the different notes,
and I think as you got stronger,

01:07:08.695 --> 01:07:10.530
you were getting a little tuney,
and I think

01:07:10.572 --> 01:07:12.157
you were getting
a little pinched as well.

01:07:12.198 --> 01:07:15.201
And I think that's all
gonna come down to coaching

01:07:15.243 --> 01:07:17.203
and trying to, like,
map out,

01:07:17.245 --> 01:07:18.872
like, when you're
gonna breathe.
Yep.

01:07:18.913 --> 01:07:21.541
I love your style
and your personality,

01:07:21.583 --> 01:07:23.126
and your voice,
I think, is beautiful.

01:07:23.168 --> 01:07:24.336
So, keep it going.

01:07:24.377 --> 01:07:25.879
Thank you so, so much.

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:28.381
I heard the beginning
and I was like,

01:07:28.423 --> 01:07:30.258
"Oh, cool voice.
Cool voice."

01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:31.676
And then when you did
that scoop

01:07:31.718 --> 01:07:33.053
and then went
into the big note,

01:07:33.094 --> 01:07:35.889
I was like, "Okay,
I want Elizabeth on my team."

01:07:35.930 --> 01:07:38.558
Sometimes people
get a little flustered,

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:40.977
but good coaching,
good planning

01:07:41.019 --> 01:07:43.563
can make sure
that doesn't happen again

01:07:43.605 --> 01:07:44.731
because you have
everything you need.

01:07:44.773 --> 01:07:46.232
I would love to be
your coach

01:07:46.274 --> 01:07:49.277
because I really can help you
think about the right songs

01:07:49.319 --> 01:07:52.072
and we could have
so much fun together, Elizabeth.

01:07:52.113 --> 01:07:53.573
That was a good pitch.

01:07:53.615 --> 01:07:54.991
So, Elizabeth,

01:07:55.033 --> 01:07:57.410
it is time to see
which one of us

01:07:57.452 --> 01:07:59.788
you would like to choose
as your coach.

01:07:59.829 --> 01:08:01.748
[ Audience shouting ]

01:08:01.790 --> 01:08:04.042

Come on.

01:08:04.084 --> 01:08:07.379

such a hard decision.

01:08:09.631 --> 01:08:11.466

Yes!

John: Team Legend is getting
some great wins today.

01:08:20.141 --> 01:08:23.103
I think Elizabeth showed
her range immediately.

01:08:23.144 --> 01:08:25.772
She showed her power.
She showed this beautiful tone.

01:08:25.814 --> 01:08:27.899
So, I'm really curious to see
what her interests are

01:08:27.941 --> 01:08:29.901
and where she wants
to go as an artist.

01:08:29.943 --> 01:08:31.778

Thank you.

01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:33.738

John's first rodeo.

Alright!

01:08:41.246 --> 01:08:44.332
that he has had
will rub off on me.

Now that Blake's gone,

I am the most experienced coach
on "The Voice."

I am 31, and I'm from
the Sunshine Coast in Australia,

in Nashville, Tennessee.

01:09:41.639 --> 01:09:42.849
**

01:09:42.891 --> 01:09:45.894
My childhood
was very adventurous.

01:09:45.935 --> 01:09:47.270
My dad's a country singer.

01:09:47.312 --> 01:09:49.314
He's been a country singer
for 30-plus years.

01:09:49.356 --> 01:09:52.734
My dad was definitely
a pioneer back in the '80s,

01:09:52.776 --> 01:09:55.278
kind of the Johnny Cash
of Australia.

01:09:56.780 --> 01:09:58.823
My whole family would always
travel together,

01:09:58.865 --> 01:10:01.993
playing country music
every night, different town.

01:10:02.035 --> 01:10:03.995
Was always sleeping in suitcases

01:10:04.037 --> 01:10:06.331
or sleeping in guitar
cases backstage

01:10:06.373 --> 01:10:07.957
when Dad's doing concerts.

01:10:07.999 --> 01:10:10.960
When I turned 18,
I knew that it was time

01:10:11.002 --> 01:10:15.256
for me to pack up and head
to America and chase my dreams.

01:10:15.298 --> 01:10:17.676
I've always dreamed
of having kids

01:10:17.717 --> 01:10:19.594
and, like my dad,
giving my guitars

01:10:19.636 --> 01:10:21.471
and my songs to my children.

01:10:21.513 --> 01:10:25.183
My wife, Paige and I,
we have a son, Jameson.

01:10:25.225 --> 01:10:30.980
He reminds me every day
that everything is possible.

01:10:31.022 --> 01:10:34.275
And I'm so thankful to say that
I've been full time in music

01:10:34.317 --> 01:10:35.985
for three-plus years now.

01:10:36.027 --> 01:10:39.781
Seeing Jordan now
in a full-time music career,

01:10:39.823 --> 01:10:41.491
I'm super proud as a dad,

01:10:41.533 --> 01:10:46.079
seeing him pursuing
the convictions of his heart.

01:10:46.121 --> 01:10:49.457
A few years ago, I got contacted
by an EDM artist.

[ Laughing ]
I didn't even know what EDM was.

01:10:52.210 --> 01:10:54.212
And he wanted me to sing
on this dance song,

01:10:54.254 --> 01:10:55.296
and it went really well.

01:10:55.338 --> 01:10:57.966
I now get hit up
by hundreds of deejays

on their songs,

01:10:59.676 --> 01:11:01.845

my identity again,

01:22:55.266 --> 01:22:57.727
Nini Iris.

01:22:57.769 --> 01:23:00.146
Remember the name.

01:23:00.188 --> 01:23:03.441
This girl is off the charts.

01:23:03.483 --> 01:23:05.151
Ready-made superstar.

01:23:05.193 --> 01:23:06.820
She was commanding the stage,

01:23:06.861 --> 01:23:10.657
arguably the best vocal we have
heard in this whole competition.

01:23:10.699 --> 01:23:12.575
She's gonna go the whole way.

01:23:12.617 --> 01:23:15.412
Oh, my God.
Feel my heart.
I appreciate you.

01:23:15.453 --> 01:23:16.621
[ Screams, laughs ]

01:23:16.663 --> 01:23:19.374
I wanted to get
a big rock voice,

01:23:19.416 --> 01:23:21.918
something that had energy
and took the roof off the place,

01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:23.253
and she did that.

01:23:23.294 --> 01:23:26.089
John Legend was turning
into the four-chair king,

01:23:26.131 --> 01:23:28.133
but the four-chair prince
is here now.

01:23:28.174 --> 01:23:29.634
* Young blood *

01:23:29.676 --> 01:23:31.594
[ Laughter ]

01:23:31.636 --> 01:23:33.763
Oh, John.

01:23:33.805 --> 01:23:35.515
Oh.

01:23:35.557 --> 01:23:37.267
What?

01:23:37.308 --> 01:23:38.601
Niall started out
with the kind of

01:23:38.643 --> 01:23:40.937
rambling-man pitch style

01:23:40.979 --> 01:23:43.314
where he would just say
more and more things,

01:23:43.356 --> 01:23:44.774
but he's starting to hone it.

01:23:44.816 --> 01:23:46.192
Doesn't it look good?
I'm just kidding.

01:23:46.234 --> 01:23:48.862
Doesn't it look good?
He's doing the Casanova,

01:23:48.903 --> 01:23:51.364
"I'll woo you.
I'll get on my knees."

01:23:51.406 --> 01:23:52.615
He got on his knees.

01:23:52.657 --> 01:23:54.117
I thought he was
gonna propose.

01:23:54.159 --> 01:23:58.329
These young ladies are
susceptible to Niall's wooing.

01:23:58.371 --> 01:24:00.206
[ Cheers and applause ]

01:24:00.248 --> 01:24:04.044
**

01:24:04.085 --> 01:24:05.170
And I don't like it.

01:24:05.211 --> 01:24:15.138
**

01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:25.148
**

01:24:25.190 --> 01:24:35.200
**
