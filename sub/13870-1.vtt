00:28.000 --> 00:29.860
Do you think I could use the hay harvest

00:29.895 --> 00:31.685
as the subject of the Sunday sermon?

00:31.720 --> 00:34.560
Like you did last year?
And the year before that?

00:36.720 --> 00:41.280
"Be not deceived God is not mocked."

00:41.315 --> 00:43.537
"For whatsoever a man soweth,"

00:43.572 --> 00:45.760
"that shall he also reap."

01:06.680 --> 01:08.125
You let her read these books,

01:08.160 --> 01:11.000
most of which should not even
be in a Christian household.

01:12.280 --> 01:14.125
Mary, if you would
only read them yourself.

01:14.160 --> 01:18.000
I've always believed that if you
turn your back on new ideas...

01:48.240 --> 01:51.960
You fill her head with ideas
and doubts and confusions.

01:51.995 --> 01:54.657
She has an alert and voracious mind.

01:54.692 --> 01:57.320
- It must be fed.
- She's a child!

02:29.280 --> 02:30.600
Harriet?

02:37.080 --> 02:38.845
Harriet?!

02:42.680 --> 02:44.760
- Harriet!
- Harriet!

02:49.800 --> 02:50.980
Harriet?

02:51.015 --> 02:52.160
Father.

02:53.240 --> 02:56.800
- We heard a voice. A man's voice.
- A man?

02:58.120 --> 02:59.680
If you're sure you're all right?

02:59.715 --> 03:00.720
Of course.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.120
Good night.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.480
Fresh fruit, waiting to be plucked.

03:31.895 --> 03:36.920
*CREDIT LINE*

03:58.480 --> 03:59.760
Can I move?

04:02.320 --> 04:03.920
I think there's a mouse in my boot.

04:06.360 --> 04:09.640
I took the photograph ages
ago. I was just looking at you.

04:21.680 --> 04:24.400
Not now, we're late enough as it is.

04:48.440 --> 04:49.840
You're home.

05:00.640 --> 05:01.845
Mr Nathan!

05:01.880 --> 05:03.720
Mr Nathan's back.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.165
- Welcome home, sir.
- Thank you, Gideon.

05:08.200 --> 05:11.080
- Good to see you again, ma'am.
- Thank you, William.

05:11.115 --> 05:12.325
- Thank you.
- How's the cider?

05:12.360 --> 05:15.400
Oh, proper drop, sir. All
ready for the solstice tonight.

05:16.800 --> 05:17.880
Good to see you, John.

05:17.915 --> 05:19.197
Sir.

05:19.232 --> 05:20.480
Ma'am.

05:33.880 --> 05:36.400
- Gwen.
- Mr Nathan. Mrs Appleby.

05:36.435 --> 05:37.840
- Gwen.
- Toby!

05:41.600 --> 05:44.125
How is she?

05:44.160 --> 05:47.440
She's weak, sir. But looking
forward to seeing you.

05:48.880 --> 05:52.160
Thank you, Gwen, for looking after her.

05:54.960 --> 05:56.325
Vienna?

05:56.360 --> 05:59.405
What on Earth were you doing in Vienna?

05:59.440 --> 06:02.520
I was invited to give a talk
about psychological trauma.

06:05.080 --> 06:06.405
Where's your laudanum?

06:06.440 --> 06:09.240
I am so proud of you, Nathan.

06:09.275 --> 06:11.685
You've achieved so much.

06:11.720 --> 06:14.320
Charlotte and I might stay
a little longer this time.

06:14.355 --> 06:17.245
- I've missed the farm.
- No, Nathan,

06:17.280 --> 06:20.920
you are not to stay here
and mollycoddle an old woman.

06:20.955 --> 06:24.560
Your life is in London.
- your work, your patients.

06:26.920 --> 06:31.320
Charlotte, tell your husband
he's needed back in London.

06:31.355 --> 06:33.325
Actually, I was thinking,

06:33.360 --> 06:36.880
a few weeks in the country
is just what we need.

06:39.080 --> 06:40.760
They're ready to light the bonfire.

06:55.160 --> 06:56.400
Nathan...

06:58.200 --> 07:01.085
let Gideon do it.

07:01.120 --> 07:03.800
An Appleby always
lights the solstice fire.

Nathan.

08:58.280 --> 09:00.160
Nathan.

09:16.920 --> 09:18.160
Who are you?

09:20.320 --> 09:21.960
What do you want with him?

09:21.995 --> 09:23.797
You leave him alone!

09:23.832 --> 09:25.600
You leave my son alone!

10:02.920 --> 10:05.245
- She was a good mistress.
- Mm.

10:05.280 --> 10:07.760
She was a good mother...
and grandmother.

10:07.795 --> 10:09.285
Grandmother?

10:09.320 --> 10:10.960
Mr Nathan's son, Gabriel.

10:12.760 --> 10:15.285
When his first wife died...

10:15.320 --> 10:17.005
he stayed in London with his work

10:17.040 --> 10:19.880
and Gabriel was sent here to
be brought up by Mrs Appleby.

10:19.915 --> 10:21.600
That's right.

10:22.800 --> 10:26.080
She doted on that boy, she
did. Broke her heart when...

10:29.560 --> 10:32.640
He won't keep the house on
with such memories, will he?

10:32.675 --> 10:34.480
He'll sell it, for sure.

10:36.080 --> 10:38.400
Mr Nathan won't let us
down, I'm sure of that.

10:38.435 --> 10:40.685
This day was always going to come

10:40.720 --> 10:43.680
and now the world will
change, you'll see.

10:45.840 --> 10:49.320
We can sell it. It's a rundown,
outmoded farm in the middle

10:49.355 --> 10:51.440
of an agricultural recession.

10:52.440 --> 10:56.280
Of course, I'll do my best to
see that everyone is retained

10:56.315 --> 10:58.040
or re-employed elsewhere.

10:59.840 --> 11:01.080
That's the least I could do.

11:02.280 --> 11:03.720
Isn't there an alternative?

11:05.040 --> 11:07.560
That we move down here and...

11:08.680 --> 11:10.045
we keep the farm in the family

11:10.080 --> 11:11.800
and we keep these people in their homes.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.840
Can we even think of doing such a thing?

12:32.040 --> 12:35.120
- Careful with that, that's from London.
- Ma'am.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
I hardly think your father expected
you to spend your inheritance

12:51.035 --> 12:53.000
on a traction engine!

12:54.280 --> 12:56.120
- Mr Appleby.
- Gideon.

12:56.155 --> 12:58.477
Going in there, is him, sir?

12:58.512 --> 13:00.800
- That's the plan.
- Yes, sir.

13:05.120 --> 13:07.520
Just don't expect everyone
to welcome these changes

13:07.555 --> 13:08.525
with open arms.

13:08.560 --> 13:11.285
If we don't do something
radical, this place will die.

13:11.320 --> 13:14.680
This traction engine will
revolutionise how this farm is run,

13:14.715 --> 13:16.085
you'll see.

13:16.120 --> 13:19.280
I think you might be the
mostly blindly optimistic person

13:19.315 --> 13:20.285
I've ever met.

13:20.320 --> 13:22.960
I wonder if it's actually
a psychological condition.

14:05.640 --> 14:06.960
All ready, Gideon?

14:09.000 --> 14:10.760
John...

14:12.160 --> 14:13.840
Sit on the plough, men!

14:27.400 --> 14:28.640
Carpe diem.

15:46.680 --> 15:51.560
As you know, Harriet has always
been a bright and lovely child.

15:53.800 --> 15:58.600
Then, Mary and I noticed her
getting more and more remote from us.

15:58.635 --> 15:59.800
Subdued.

16:27.640 --> 16:31.560
She finds herself caught
between childhood and womanhood.

16:31.595 --> 16:35.480
It's an exciting, but
very, very awkward place.

16:37.760 --> 16:39.400
Yes, that's what we told ourselves.

16:40.800 --> 16:43.760
But we've watched as the
spark went from her eyes.

17:05.240 --> 17:09.040
We have heard about your
pioneering work in psychology

17:09.075 --> 17:10.365
and know that you have had

17:10.400 --> 17:14.444
a great success in London
with aberrant behaviour.

17:14.480 --> 17:17.640
Your mother always so proudly
showed us your cuttings...

17:17.675 --> 17:19.319
That work is...

17:20.440 --> 17:23.925
behind me, at least for now.

17:23.960 --> 17:30.400
This is a new start for us and
I must give it my full attention.

17:39.760 --> 17:41.600
You look tired.

17:43.280 --> 17:46.440
Extremely desirable, but tired.

17:46.475 --> 17:48.280
Go to bed, strumpet.

17:49.320 --> 17:50.740
I will...

17:50.775 --> 17:52.160
with you.

17:54.520 --> 17:57.525
- Let me just finish these accounts.
- Are they bad?

17:57.560 --> 18:00.740
Every time I wrote to her, I
asked her how the farm was doing

18:00.775 --> 18:03.885
and every time she wrote back
to me, she said it was fine.

18:03.920 --> 18:07.280
- She probably didn't want to worry you.
- Well, I'm worried now.

18:10.360 --> 18:12.780
We can make it work, can't we?

18:12.815 --> 18:15.165
I love it here, we have to.

18:15.200 --> 18:18.160
Well, if we could convince the
railway to bring a branch line

18:18.195 --> 18:21.600
- across our land...
- Then that is what we shall do.

18:24.720 --> 18:26.765
You had a good day, didn't you?

18:26.800 --> 18:29.400
I did, thank you for asking.
You would have been proud of me.

18:29.435 --> 18:31.880
I'm always proud of you.

18:33.920 --> 18:35.920
You promise me you don't miss London?

18:35.955 --> 18:37.805
No.

18:37.840 --> 18:40.360
- Come to bed.
- Or your work?

18:40.395 --> 18:42.880
No. Come to bed.

18:44.640 --> 18:45.760
Soon.

19:21.440 --> 19:24.800
Doesn't look like anybody's
been in here in years.

19:24.835 --> 19:26.440
Nobody has, ma'am.

19:33.080 --> 19:35.760
- What do you think?
- Oh, very fetching!

19:35.795 --> 19:38.440
Is it true you used to take photographs

19:38.475 --> 19:40.205
of kings and queens, ma'am?

19:40.240 --> 19:42.400
Er, more debutantes and dogs, actually!

19:57.320 --> 19:59.840
Mr Nathan's boy... Gabriel.

20:04.080 --> 20:05.560
Did you know him?

20:06.600 --> 20:08.325
Not really.

20:08.360 --> 20:10.880
I used to hear a little
boy's laughter in the house...

20:11.880 --> 20:13.380
Then, one day...

20:13.415 --> 20:14.880
no more laughter.

20:50.640 --> 20:51.645
It won't bite, John!

20:51.680 --> 20:55.280
♪ All this, you well may understand

20:55.315 --> 20:58.617
♪ Comes from the ploughing boy. ♪

20:58.652 --> 21:01.920
He looks like me on my wedding night.

21:03.600 --> 21:05.200
It's good to have you back, sir.

21:06.840 --> 21:08.640
I never thought I'd live to see the day.

21:55.255 --> 21:56.320
Nathan?

22:05.920 --> 22:06.960
Harriet?

22:08.720 --> 22:11.080
Harriet!

22:15.440 --> 22:17.000
What are you doing?

22:19.600 --> 22:21.320
Help.

22:23.720 --> 22:25.200
It's all right.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.400
Give me your hand. Your hand.

22:30.680 --> 22:32.040
Nathan...

22:33.360 --> 22:34.520
What's happened?

22:37.480 --> 22:41.040
Gwen, I want you to send one
of the boys to the vicarage,

22:41.075 --> 22:42.937
tell them that Harriet is quite safe

22:42.972 --> 22:44.800
and she's spending the night with us.

22:44.835 --> 22:46.240
Let's get you warm.

23:37.400 --> 23:39.960
I said I would monitor
her for a few days.

23:39.995 --> 23:41.565
We've been down here five minutes

23:41.600 --> 23:43.765
and you've gone back
to being a psychologist.

23:43.800 --> 23:46.640
Hardly that. The girl is more
troubled than I thought, that's all.

23:46.675 --> 23:49.477
- She needs me.
- I need you! The farm needs you!

23:49.512 --> 23:52.280
You saw her last night. I
can't turn my back on her.

23:52.315 --> 23:53.845
Charlotte...

23:53.880 --> 23:55.885
I've known the Dennings for years.

23:55.920 --> 23:58.640
I've known Harriet since she
was a little girl. She's changed.

23:58.675 --> 23:59.965
She's definitely different.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.840
You'll do what you want
to do. You always do.

24:04.160 --> 24:05.560
That's not fair.

24:07.280 --> 24:10.120
Do what you can for the
girl. Of course you must.

24:11.240 --> 24:12.760
Just do it quickly.

24:26.320 --> 24:28.360
It's wonderful. Who took it?

24:31.440 --> 24:32.685
My wife.

24:32.720 --> 24:34.740
Your second wife?

24:34.775 --> 24:36.760
Yes, my second wife.

24:39.400 --> 24:40.640
Come and sit down.

24:42.920 --> 24:46.960
- So, tell me what happened.
- What do you mean?

24:51.200 --> 24:55.040
Well, you walked the best part
of a mile in your bare feet

24:55.075 --> 24:56.440
to stand in my lake.

25:00.200 --> 25:03.040
- If I hadn't seen you from the window...
- I don't remember.

25:03.075 --> 25:05.400
You don't remember how you got here?

25:07.480 --> 25:09.280
No.

25:10.400 --> 25:13.320
Do you remember why you
were standing in the lake?

25:14.560 --> 25:15.600
Harriet?

25:18.000 --> 25:19.680
The man told me to.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.205
What man?

25:22.240 --> 25:23.920
The man that comes to me.

25:24.960 --> 25:26.280
Who is he?

25:31.560 --> 25:34.560
- Does he have a name?
- Do you think she would take my portrait?

25:41.515 --> 25:42.837
Ibsen.

25:42.872 --> 25:44.160
Zola.

25:45.600 --> 25:47.245
Darwin.

25:47.280 --> 25:50.480
We're interested in
ideas, my daughter and I.

25:50.515 --> 25:52.285
She's a remarkable child, Appleby.

25:52.320 --> 25:56.600
Until these last weeks, she was a
dream of what a daughter could be.

26:03.360 --> 26:05.160
What are you doing?

26:11.360 --> 26:12.760
That's never been opened.

26:15.200 --> 26:18.040
Have you ever looked for an
alcoholic's secret bottle?

26:18.075 --> 26:20.165
No, of course not.

26:20.200 --> 26:22.240
You won't find it in the drinks cabinet.

26:29.240 --> 26:33.080
The phonograph in your study,
where did you get it from?

26:41.040 --> 26:43.720
- Since my time at Shepzoy,
which is all my life,

26:43.755 --> 26:45.240
we've mostly favoured Tremlett.

26:45.275 --> 26:46.845
It's Gideon!

26:46.880 --> 26:50.840
There was something of a change
to Yarlington Mill in the 1860s,

26:50.875 --> 26:52.577
then back to Tremlett.

26:52.612 --> 26:54.245
Now, Mrs Appleby...

26:54.280 --> 26:56.165
One of the greatest
inventions of our age,

26:56.200 --> 26:58.560
and Gideon is talking
in cider apple varieties!

27:01.480 --> 27:04.725
You could be dead and buried 100 years

27:04.760 --> 27:07.200
and people could still
hear what you sounded like.

27:07.235 --> 27:08.880
Mm.

27:24.960 --> 27:26.000
Daddy!

27:27.200 --> 27:28.525
Daddy!

27:28.560 --> 27:31.005
Move a bit nearer, Gabriel.

27:31.040 --> 27:33.240
Daddy, where are you, Daddy?

27:38.800 --> 27:41.485
Daddy?

27:41.520 --> 27:42.920
Where are you, Daddy?

28:00.640 --> 28:01.960
Daddy?

28:03.560 --> 28:04.880
Daddy?

28:07.600 --> 28:09.720
Daddy, where are you, Daddy?

28:46.720 --> 28:49.300
I suppose I'll be seeing
you next year, then?

28:49.335 --> 28:51.880
If I'm not married.
Perhaps even if I am.

29:21.080 --> 29:23.365
My name is Abel North.

29:23.400 --> 29:27.120
The people in this
village wouldn't spit on me

29:27.155 --> 29:29.725
if I was on fire, truth be told.

29:29.760 --> 29:33.960
And nor I them. Bunch of
wretches and vagrants, every one.

29:35.680 --> 29:39.080
Except for the wenches. The young ones.

29:39.115 --> 29:42.480
Like fresh fruit waiting to be plucked.

29:43.960 --> 29:46.325
I'll pluck 'em, all right!

29:46.360 --> 29:48.700
- Don't look like that.
- Who is it?

29:48.735 --> 29:50.887
You won't bury me, so what do you care?

29:50.922 --> 29:53.040
Turn it off, Nathan. It's horrible.

29:53.075 --> 29:54.605
You'll never bury me...

29:54.640 --> 29:57.885
bury me... bury me... bury me...

29:57.920 --> 30:00.560
No river for the likes of you!

30:15.600 --> 30:17.285
Abel North is one of the meanest,

30:17.320 --> 30:22.360
most godless man I have ever had the
misfortune to share a flagon with.

30:22.395 --> 30:26.920
John, you remember Abel North?

30:29.080 --> 30:31.320
His father was one of
them Baptist preachers,

30:31.355 --> 30:32.925
travelling around dunking folk.

30:32.960 --> 30:36.640
He was hard on Abel, I do know that.

30:36.675 --> 30:38.360
Whipped him like a dog.

30:40.600 --> 30:42.205
Where is he now?

30:42.240 --> 30:45.840
In hell... if the Devil'll have him.

31:12.880 --> 31:14.700
Jesus Christ, John!

31:14.735 --> 31:16.485
About Abel North, sir.

31:16.520 --> 31:19.160
One night, when he was in
his cups in the Wheatsheaf,

31:19.195 --> 31:20.520
he did boast of something.

31:22.280 --> 31:26.360
He said he killed a woman,
sir. A woman from the workhouse.

31:26.395 --> 31:29.157
- Did you tell anyone?
- There was no evidence, sir.

31:29.192 --> 31:31.920
When he was sober the
next day, he denied it all.

31:33.800 --> 31:36.240
But his eyes... they
were laughing at me.

31:39.400 --> 31:40.440
Sir.

31:45.760 --> 31:48.925
- Like fresh fruit
waiting to be plucked...

31:48.960 --> 31:52.040
What interests me is, out of all
the different voices you could

31:52.075 --> 31:53.760
have chosen, you chose Abel North.

31:53.795 --> 31:54.960
Why was that, Harriet?

31:54.995 --> 31:55.995
I chose nobody.

31:57.160 --> 31:58.960
Abel North's voice is very distinctive.

32:00.400 --> 32:01.520
Are you calling me a liar?

32:02.600 --> 32:05.340
- No.
- Then, I will tell you one more time,

32:05.375 --> 32:08.080
I've never seen any of
this before in my life.

32:22.760 --> 32:27.720
She's a strange one, ma'am,
in't she, that Miss Harriet?

32:27.755 --> 32:30.445
"Troubled" is the word
my husband would use.

32:30.480 --> 32:34.880
Still, I'm sure Mr Appleby
can look after himself.

32:36.680 --> 32:38.805
Let's talk about Abel North.

32:38.840 --> 32:42.960
I'd rather talk about
your patients in London.

32:42.995 --> 32:45.045
What would you like to know?

32:45.080 --> 32:48.160
- What sort of people were they?
- All sorts.

32:48.195 --> 32:51.325
Rich and poor, old and young.

32:51.360 --> 32:55.960
But all were troubled, or had
got themselves lost in some way.

32:55.995 --> 32:58.925
- Lost?
- Mmm.

32:58.960 --> 33:03.400
The old certainties are gone and
people look for meaning elsewhere -

33:03.435 --> 33:09.400
in spiritualism, in
mediums, in mesmerism.

33:11.840 --> 33:12.880
The occult.

33:15.560 --> 33:19.360
And some of those people got
damaged and became my patients.

33:21.240 --> 33:23.880
Do you believe in ghosts?

33:25.760 --> 33:28.160
I believe in an open
and scientific mind.

33:29.200 --> 33:30.925
I have certainly seen people haunted,

33:30.960 --> 33:34.525
but only by an aspect of
themselves, never by a ghost.

33:34.560 --> 33:40.680
But you and I, working together,
will conquer this, Harriet.

33:44.600 --> 33:49.045
I think she's frightened
of her own sexuality.

33:49.080 --> 33:53.080
She's listened to the cylinders
and created this unpleasant

33:53.115 --> 33:55.637
male alter ego to justify her fears.

33:55.672 --> 33:58.160
Gwen thinks she's out to seduce you.

34:10.440 --> 34:14.040
Something for us to look at
when we're old and toothless.

34:20.960 --> 34:22.400
Now...

34:24.159 --> 34:28.120
- try to look overwhelmed with lust.
- All right.

34:34.800 --> 34:36.960
What was that?!

36:28.120 --> 36:30.560
The valve in the
boiler has been smashed.

36:30.595 --> 36:32.965
Who would do such a thing?

36:33.000 --> 36:35.840
I will write to the
manufacturers in Leeds.

36:35.875 --> 36:37.605
They will send a replacement valve.

36:37.640 --> 36:41.240
And in the meantime, it just sits
here, earning us precisely nothing?

36:41.275 --> 36:43.325
We knew it wouldn't be easy, Charlotte.

36:43.360 --> 36:46.840
I didn't realise people would
vandalise their own futures!

36:46.875 --> 36:50.805
I hate that thing, Mrs
Appleby, with all my heart.

36:50.840 --> 36:54.560
It'll one day take our jobs,
as it's already taken my pride.

36:54.595 --> 36:56.725
- Come now, John...
- There is not a person here,

36:56.760 --> 37:00.760
not one, that would damage
anything belonging to this farm.

37:00.795 --> 37:03.600
I'm sorry. It was never my intention...

37:03.635 --> 37:06.040
Please, John.

37:09.840 --> 37:13.480
Forgive me. I am new here
and I will make mistakes.

37:30.640 --> 37:33.045
We have to start making
some progress, Harriet.

37:33.080 --> 37:36.560
I think I can help you, but I
can only help you if you trust me.

37:36.595 --> 37:38.765
You can only help me if you believe me.

37:38.800 --> 37:41.560
- Abel North is a symptom, he's
not the cause. - He's a ghost. - No.

37:41.595 --> 37:43.737
- He's a ghost and he's inside me.
- No.

37:43.772 --> 37:45.880
And there's nothing you can do about it!

37:46.920 --> 37:49.480
You wanted to know when
her gravestone was set, sir.

37:49.515 --> 37:51.680
Yes, thank you, Gideon. Thank you.

37:57.280 --> 37:59.560
There is something I have to do.

38:19.000 --> 38:23.920
Nathan. Nathan, you look tired.

38:23.955 --> 38:25.120
What do you want with him?

38:25.155 --> 38:27.077
You leave him alone!

38:27.112 --> 38:28.965
You leave my son alone!

38:29.000 --> 38:31.500
Daddy? Daddy?

38:31.535 --> 38:33.587
Where are you?

38:33.622 --> 38:35.605
That's enough!

38:35.640 --> 38:38.165
Where are you, Daddy?

38:38.200 --> 38:39.885
- Where are you, Daddy?
- I said, enough!

38:39.920 --> 38:42.365
Where are you, Daddy?
Where are you?

38:42.400 --> 38:44.320
- Where are you, Daddy?
- Enough. - Where are you?

38:44.355 --> 38:46.525
Harriet, that's enough.

38:46.560 --> 38:49.920
Don't hurt me. Please don't hurt me.

38:56.800 --> 38:59.960
I didn't mean to
frighten you. I'm sorry.

39:03.680 --> 39:05.645
No, Harriet!

39:05.680 --> 39:07.360
You know you want to.

39:16.480 --> 39:19.125
What's the new mistress
like to work for, then?

39:19.160 --> 39:21.540
Oh, she's not shy and
retiring, I can tell you that.

39:21.575 --> 39:23.920
She'll drag this farm to
hell and all of us with her,

39:23.955 --> 39:24.925
you mark my words.

39:24.960 --> 39:28.080
The new mistress does certainly
fill her clothes very pleasantly.

39:28.115 --> 39:29.600
Shame on you, Gideon!

39:31.560 --> 39:33.960
Don't mind us, John. You just carry on.

39:41.760 --> 39:44.800
She heard Gabriel's voice
on the cylinder, that's all.

39:44.835 --> 39:47.560
I know, I know. It's...
It's just it, er...

39:48.760 --> 39:50.005
It sounded so like him.

39:50.040 --> 39:52.360
Which makes her cruel
and manipulative, not ill.

39:54.920 --> 39:56.605
- We find her...
- Yes.

39:56.640 --> 39:58.520
And we get her out of our lives.

40:08.080 --> 40:13.040
♪ She stepped away from me

40:14.760 --> 40:19.760
♪ And she moved through the fair... ♪

40:21.760 --> 40:23.365
Come on, my beauties.

40:23.400 --> 40:26.240
♪ And fondly I watched her... ♪

40:27.640 --> 40:33.040
♪ Move here and move there

40:34.640 --> 40:39.000
♪ And she went away homeward... ♪

40:39.035 --> 40:40.485
Walk on.

40:40.520 --> 40:46.445
♪ With one star awake

40:46.480 --> 40:48.360
♪ As the swans in the evening... ♪

40:48.395 --> 40:50.200
There she is! Harriet!

40:53.560 --> 40:57.160
♪ Move over the lake... ♪

41:09.360 --> 41:11.360
John!

41:18.680 --> 41:19.720
John!

41:53.440 --> 41:55.280
Perhaps he was ill. Or in debt.

41:56.640 --> 41:59.560
But if he was in trouble,
why didn't he just come to me?

41:59.595 --> 42:01.125
Maybe it was what I said?

42:01.160 --> 42:04.680
- No! - I practically accused him of
sabotaging that stupid machine.

42:04.715 --> 42:05.920
No. He loved this farm.

42:07.880 --> 42:11.120
Three generations of Roebucks
have ploughed this land.

42:12.760 --> 42:15.325
I've known them my whole life.

42:15.360 --> 42:18.360
And what he did today, I
just don't understand it.

42:19.800 --> 42:21.800
Are they ever going to trust us now?

44:20.600 --> 44:21.920
This will help you sleep.

44:40.635 --> 44:41.605
No.

44:41.640 --> 44:43.960
The girl needs proper
care. Doctors, hospital.

44:45.920 --> 44:48.640
She is hurting herself! How long
before she hurts someone else?

44:48.675 --> 44:51.497
She was entrusted into my care
and I will do my best for her.

44:51.532 --> 44:54.320
- Is this empathy, Nathan, or arrogance?
- She needs rest.

44:56.960 --> 44:59.840
In the morning, if her
parents agree with you...

45:02.240 --> 45:04.440
I'll send her to my
colleagues in London.

45:10.400 --> 45:12.520
And we shall see if we
still have a farm to run.

46:13.120 --> 46:14.680
Morning, ma'am.

46:16.400 --> 46:17.685
You came.

46:17.720 --> 46:20.560
Of course we came. This is what we do.

46:28.520 --> 46:29.720
Morning, ma'am.

46:46.560 --> 46:48.685
Don't look like that.

46:48.720 --> 46:51.445
You won't bury me, so what do you care?

46:51.480 --> 46:56.280
You'll never bury me... bury
me... bury me... bury me... bury...

47:00.320 --> 47:02.485
"No river for the
likes of you," he said.

47:02.520 --> 47:07.000
"Wretched boy. Evil boy.
Never a river for you."

47:22.080 --> 47:23.400
Charlie!

47:25.160 --> 47:26.720
Help me, Charlie.

47:27.960 --> 47:29.120
Miss Harriet?

47:31.760 --> 47:34.320
- Take me to her.
- She's upstairs.

47:55.760 --> 47:58.200
Oh, what is wrong
with you, Miss Harriet?

47:58.235 --> 48:00.640
I nearly went to meet my Maker, I did!

48:20.360 --> 48:23.880
- He that believeth and
is baptised shall be saved!

48:40.120 --> 48:42.920
It's well founded. There have
been cases of double or even

48:42.955 --> 48:45.417
triple consciousness existing
within the same person.

48:45.452 --> 48:48.486
Can you help her? That
is the only question here.

48:48.521 --> 48:51.520
I would like your permission
to hypnotise Harriet.

48:51.555 --> 48:52.720
Hypnotise?

48:54.040 --> 48:56.840
Are you a doctor or a
fairground turn, Mr Appleby?

49:00.200 --> 49:02.165
Thank you both for
your time and patience.

49:02.200 --> 49:04.805
One moment more and your
daughter was a murderer.

49:04.840 --> 49:08.760
That's what the law will say.
Take Harriet out of this house now,

49:08.795 --> 49:11.800
you start her on a journey
that could end up in the asylum,

49:11.835 --> 49:13.125
perhaps even prison.

49:13.160 --> 49:18.200
Listen to him, Mary. If anyone
can help Harriet, it's him.

49:26.440 --> 49:28.040
There is no Abel North.

49:30.320 --> 49:32.560
What you think of as
Abel North is a splinter

49:32.595 --> 49:36.800
of your own personality...
exaggerated...

49:38.920 --> 49:40.720
and unbalancing the whole.

49:45.160 --> 49:47.040
I want you to concentrate on the watch.

49:51.360 --> 49:52.800
Look steadily at the watch.

49:54.960 --> 49:56.400
Let everything else fade away.

49:58.000 --> 49:59.205
Relax.

49:59.240 --> 50:01.640
Listen to the sound of my voice.

50:02.840 --> 50:06.000
Let all your worries and
stresses fall from your shoulders.

50:07.920 --> 50:10.640
Feel them flowing through
the end of your fingers.

50:14.760 --> 50:16.845
I'm going to count to five

50:16.880 --> 50:19.280
and at the sound of each
number, you will be deeper,

50:19.315 --> 50:21.600
safer. One.

50:21.635 --> 50:22.957
Two.

50:22.992 --> 50:24.456
Three.

50:24.491 --> 50:25.785
Four.

50:25.820 --> 50:27.080
Five.

50:44.160 --> 50:45.480
Is that strictly necessary?

50:51.880 --> 50:54.680
Can you remember a
time before Abel North?

50:56.000 --> 50:58.840
The last moment you remember
being completely happy?

50:58.875 --> 51:00.160
Can you do that for me?

51:03.360 --> 51:06.600
Can you remember when that
happy day got compromised?

51:06.635 --> 51:08.320
When the happiness was darkened?

51:13.840 --> 51:16.360
Can you remember the first
time you saw Abel North?

51:20.880 --> 51:23.200
What happened between
those two memories, Harriet?

51:30.855 --> 51:32.600
Let me speak to him.

51:34.200 --> 51:36.400
Let me speak to Abel North.

51:37.440 --> 51:39.160
Will he come out and speak to me?

51:40.760 --> 51:42.520
Is that because Abel North is a coward?

51:42.555 --> 51:44.417
Abhorred, despised, pitied?

51:46.280 --> 51:52.880
Or is it because... he...
does... not... exist?

51:58.000 --> 51:59.640
What is happening in there?

52:06.280 --> 52:07.440
Speak to me, Abel.

52:11.200 --> 52:12.520
Why Harriet?

52:14.000 --> 52:15.960
Is it because you think she is weak?

52:17.680 --> 52:20.320
Like the girl from the workhouse?

52:24.000 --> 52:25.480
Tell me about your father, Abel.

52:26.520 --> 52:28.240
He was a preacher.

52:29.440 --> 52:30.720
He was a man of God.

52:33.280 --> 52:37.200
Imagine a life without love. What a
bleak and desolate prospect that is.

52:37.235 --> 52:40.165
But you don't need to imagine
it, do you, Abel? You lived it.

52:40.200 --> 52:43.020
- Open the door, man!
- Your father loved God, he loved the people

52:43.055 --> 52:45.840
he baptised, but he didn't love
you. He hated you. He despised you.

52:45.875 --> 52:46.965
Help me.

52:47.000 --> 52:48.325
- Please help.
- Harriet...

52:48.360 --> 52:51.680
What do you want with
him? You leave him alone!

52:51.715 --> 52:55.000
Daddy? Where are you, Daddy?

52:55.035 --> 52:56.165
You heard those voices...

52:56.200 --> 52:58.200
- Where's my boat, Daddy?
- on the phonograph.

52:58.235 --> 52:59.285
I want to sail my boat.

52:59.320 --> 53:00.900
He's lonely.

53:00.935 --> 53:02.445
No, he is not.

53:02.480 --> 53:03.685
He's got me now.

53:03.720 --> 53:05.680
I'm going to wake you up now, Harriet.

53:06.720 --> 53:08.405
Do not open this door!

53:11.120 --> 53:13.840
When I get to the number five,
you will be wide awake, refreshed,

53:13.875 --> 53:17.200
- alert... One, two, three, four, five.
- Please help me.

53:17.235 --> 53:19.400
- Harriet, you are awake.
- Get her back, man!

53:19.435 --> 53:20.885
Harriet, listen to me.

53:20.920 --> 53:22.960
- Our Father, which art in heaven...
- Harriet!

53:22.995 --> 53:24.397
You'll never bury me.

53:24.432 --> 53:25.765
Why? Why won't he bury you?

53:25.800 --> 53:28.440
He that believeth and is
baptised shall be saved!

53:30.720 --> 53:33.440
What are you doing?

53:39.240 --> 53:40.365
Stop him!

53:40.400 --> 53:44.880
- Appleby! - Nathan! - Stop
him! What are you doing?!

53:53.600 --> 53:56.840
Abel North was never baptised.

53:56.875 --> 53:58.097
Get in.

53:58.132 --> 53:59.320
Do it!

54:06.560 --> 54:07.685
He that believeth

54:07.720 --> 54:10.285
and is baptised shall be saved.

54:10.320 --> 54:15.960
I baptise thee in the name
of the Father and of the Son

54:15.995 --> 54:18.360
and of the Holy Ghost.

54:18.395 --> 54:19.800
Amen.

54:30.840 --> 54:32.000
Father.

55:01.480 --> 55:03.640
What did we see, Charlotte?

55:04.680 --> 55:06.485
A troubled girl

55:06.520 --> 55:08.400
who is less troubled now, I hope.
