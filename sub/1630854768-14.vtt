WEBVTT

00:03.562 --> 00:06.005
-(indistinct chatter)
-(telephone ringing)

00:06.232 --> 00:07.731
OWEN STRAND:
We're doing this
in your office.

00:07.750 --> 00:09.008
Sure, why not?

00:09.510 --> 00:11.844
Well, I expected that maybe...
yeah, I don't know.

00:11.920 --> 00:13.570
What, an interrogation room?

00:13.589 --> 00:15.997
Well, you call me up
on the phone and you insinuate

00:16.017 --> 00:17.499
that my girlfriend's husband
got murdered

00:17.667 --> 00:20.019
right after I finished
puttin' my fist
through his chest.

00:20.095 --> 00:21.169
You were trying to save him.

00:21.188 --> 00:22.929
Please, take a seat.

00:23.082 --> 00:24.414
Besides, that's not
what killed him.

00:24.433 --> 00:26.917
None of what
I'm about to tell you

00:26.935 --> 00:28.009
has yet been made public.

00:28.029 --> 00:29.436
But given
the family name involved,

00:29.588 --> 00:33.014
that's about to change,
and quickly, too.

00:33.034 --> 00:34.533
Normally, I don't give
this level of detail

00:34.610 --> 00:37.202
to someone who's romantically
involved with my prime suspect.

00:37.354 --> 00:39.872
But not only do I know you,
we're about to become family.

00:40.023 --> 00:41.856
And I just wanna
make sure that you have

00:41.876 --> 00:44.626
all the information you need
to make wise decisions.

00:46.530 --> 00:47.604
That's the autopsy report

00:47.864 --> 00:50.049
of Kendra Harrington's
recently deceased husband,

00:50.200 --> 00:51.124
Brett Collier.

00:51.610 --> 00:53.868
-He froze to death.
-GABRIEL REYES: Yeah, he did.

00:53.946 --> 00:54.970
Middle of the page.

00:56.206 --> 00:58.448
He had pulmonary edema,
fluid in the lungs.

00:58.450 --> 01:01.209
Which means he lost the ability
to breathe before he died.

01:01.804 --> 01:03.878
The reason he didn't
get out of that cryo chamber

01:03.898 --> 01:04.897
is because he couldn't.

01:04.973 --> 01:06.398
He was paralyzed.

01:06.550 --> 01:07.457
Paralyzed how?

01:07.568 --> 01:10.235
We have yet to identify
the neurotoxin.

01:10.312 --> 01:11.570
Somebody wanted to make it
look like an accident.

01:11.647 --> 01:12.979
"Somebody" being Kendra.

01:13.132 --> 01:14.965
GABRIEL:
Nine times out of ten,
it is the spouse.

01:14.967 --> 01:17.076
Sometimes,
it's the spouse's lover.

01:18.079 --> 01:19.727
But you didn't kill him,
did you, Owen?

01:19.747 --> 01:20.804
Uh, no.

01:21.231 --> 01:23.064
And I am not her lover.

01:23.142 --> 01:25.309
I broke it off with her
before it happened.

01:25.311 --> 01:26.660
Oh.

01:26.736 --> 01:27.811
Well...

01:28.330 --> 01:29.980
did you happen
to give her a reason?

01:30.073 --> 01:33.408
(ominous music playing)

01:33.427 --> 01:35.761
I told her I didn't wanna be
with a married woman.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.305
Well, problem solved.

01:39.675 --> 01:43.176
Look, Kendra's not going to
kill somebody to be with me.

01:43.329 --> 01:45.270
Could be that she liked it.

01:45.422 --> 01:47.356
Maybe she did it once before.

01:51.520 --> 01:53.353
This is Logan Daniels.

01:54.097 --> 01:56.264
Kendra Harrington's
first husband.

01:56.951 --> 01:58.508
They got married
straight out of college.

01:58.510 --> 02:01.011
It was short-lived,
and so was he.

02:01.029 --> 02:02.512
He fell from a hotel balcony

02:02.514 --> 02:04.289
while they were
honeymooning in Cancun.

02:04.441 --> 02:07.793
Other hotel guests said they
heard raised voices, fighting.

02:07.944 --> 02:09.110
She says she was
in the shower

02:09.188 --> 02:10.520
and that he just had
a few too many.

02:10.522 --> 02:12.631
Of course, his folks
didn't buy any of that BS

02:12.708 --> 02:18.095
and, well, the<i> federales</i>
didn't think to ask
too many questions.

02:19.640 --> 02:22.699
Look, you ended it with her.

02:22.718 --> 02:23.809
That's good.

02:24.553 --> 02:27.587
Meaning that your, uh,
association with her

02:27.739 --> 02:30.649
ended a lot better
than it did for those guys.

02:30.800 --> 02:32.042
My advice?

02:32.711 --> 02:34.711
If you wanna make it
to your son's wedding,

02:34.730 --> 02:36.062
stay away from her.

02:36.139 --> 02:38.657
Kendra Harrington
is bad news.

02:39.827 --> 02:42.995
(theme music plays)

02:44.481 --> 02:45.497
MARJAN MARWANI:
Oh, hey, Cap.
Where have you been?

02:45.574 --> 02:46.999
I've been trying
to get a hold of you.

02:47.226 --> 02:49.075
Uh, sorry, I had my phone off.
Uh, what's up?

02:49.228 --> 02:50.560
Your girlfriend Kendra
called the house line

02:50.671 --> 02:52.412
and said she was trying to get
through to you on your cell,

02:52.489 --> 02:53.505
-but she needs to speak to you--
-Okay, if she calls again,

02:53.657 --> 02:54.898
you need to tell her
that I'm not available.

02:54.917 --> 02:55.990
Okay, but, I--
the thing is--

02:56.084 --> 02:57.918
No, no buts.
And tell everyone, alright?

02:58.070 --> 02:59.069
I don't wanna get into it,

02:59.087 --> 03:01.922
but I can't speak
to her right now.

03:01.998 --> 03:03.390
Oops.

03:08.263 --> 03:10.272
♪ ♪

03:13.919 --> 03:15.360
You shouldn't be here.

03:16.530 --> 03:19.239
They think I murdered him,
don't they?

03:20.442 --> 03:22.776
I'm not sure what "they"
you're talking about.

03:22.852 --> 03:25.853
Don't, Owen.

03:25.873 --> 03:28.932
You've been icing me ever since
you got that call at your house.

03:28.934 --> 03:31.043
It was a cop, wasn't it?

03:31.119 --> 03:33.603
Texas Ranger, actually.

03:33.605 --> 03:36.006
And he's more family
than friend.

03:36.959 --> 03:38.108
He's looking out for me.

03:38.719 --> 03:41.720
Told you to keep your distance
from the Black Widow?

03:43.039 --> 03:44.038
I knew it.

03:44.058 --> 03:46.616
They've been
blowing up my phone.

03:46.618 --> 03:47.226
The Rangers.

03:47.302 --> 03:48.727
What are they saying?

03:49.212 --> 03:51.137
I don't know.
I'm not answering their calls.

03:51.214 --> 03:53.214
Why not?
What are you afraid of?

03:53.292 --> 03:55.400
It's always the spouse,
isn't it?

03:56.462 --> 03:58.795
Come on, Owen.
You know me.

03:59.465 --> 04:01.698
You know I could
never hurt anybody.

04:02.743 --> 04:03.984
Not even Logan Daniels?

04:04.060 --> 04:06.486
(ominous music)

04:06.563 --> 04:08.062
The Ranger told you
about him.

04:08.156 --> 04:11.333
He thought a dead husband
spoke to precedent.

04:13.903 --> 04:15.462
I loved Logan.

04:17.165 --> 04:20.450
And what happened to him
was a tragedy.

04:21.487 --> 04:23.987
Made worse
when everyone in the world,

04:23.989 --> 04:25.338
from the media to his family

04:25.491 --> 04:27.248
and even some of mine,
judged me

04:27.268 --> 04:29.175
and spread rumors
and lies about me

04:29.328 --> 04:30.660
without a single piece
of evidence

04:30.662 --> 04:33.605
to suggest it was anything
other than what it was.

04:33.682 --> 04:35.999
A terrible accident.

04:36.351 --> 04:39.736
You have to admit that
the men in your life
seem prone to them.

04:42.174 --> 04:44.098
You know, I've never felt
as alone as I did

04:44.192 --> 04:46.618
after Logan died,
until now.

04:47.696 --> 04:51.197
Does it look bad to have
a second husband die suddenly?

04:51.274 --> 04:53.250
Of course, it does.

04:54.110 --> 04:55.460
But why would I kill Brett?

04:55.871 --> 04:59.589
You told me yourself.
You wanted out of the marriage.

05:00.950 --> 05:02.301
We had an ironclad prenup.

05:02.452 --> 05:04.303
I could have sent him away
with 30 million

05:04.454 --> 05:06.788
and never missed a penny of it.
Why would I risk it?

05:06.865 --> 05:08.122
Maybe because
you didn't want

05:08.200 --> 05:09.308
the publicity
of a messy divorce?

05:09.535 --> 05:12.060
Because being a murder suspect
is so much better?

05:13.463 --> 05:16.356
I swear on my brother's soul,

05:17.133 --> 05:19.192
I did not do this.

05:22.972 --> 05:24.364
I believe you.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.617
Thank you. (exhales)

05:30.146 --> 05:32.497
(cell phone buzzing)

05:35.227 --> 05:36.317
It's the Rangers.

05:36.395 --> 05:37.744
-Should I pick up?
-Don't answer it.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.320
In fact, turn your phone off.

05:39.340 --> 05:40.988
-(buzzing continues)
-Are you sure?

05:41.008 --> 05:42.156
Whatever they're asking you now

05:42.234 --> 05:43.733
is just to build
a case against you.

05:43.827 --> 05:45.919
(phone screen lock clicks)

05:46.071 --> 05:48.572
Okay. But I can't hide
from them forever.

05:48.574 --> 05:52.017
Not forever. Just until
we can find some evidence

05:52.168 --> 05:53.243
on who really killed Brett.

05:53.261 --> 05:54.853
And how are we gonna do that?

05:55.004 --> 05:57.689
Lucky for us, I know a guy.

05:57.766 --> 06:00.317
Betrayal. Deceit.

06:01.678 --> 06:02.677
Larceny.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.512
Look around, friends.

06:05.107 --> 06:06.756
Because one among you
is capable of all three.

06:07.609 --> 06:11.277
Bro, don't you think you're
overreacting just a little?

06:11.354 --> 06:15.207
One of my brothers, or sisters,
took something precious from me.

06:15.283 --> 06:18.435
So tell me, Mateo,
how am I supposed to react?

06:19.362 --> 06:23.123
Uh, we are still talking about
a pudding cup here, right?

06:23.199 --> 06:24.749
Not a pudding cup.

06:24.826 --> 06:26.551
My last pudding cup.

06:27.129 --> 06:30.097
(jazzy espionage music playing)

06:34.228 --> 06:35.209
Treachery.

06:35.303 --> 06:37.229
Especially because
all of y'all know

06:37.347 --> 06:39.456
if I don't get
my sweet treats,
I get grumpy!

06:39.458 --> 06:42.175
(quietly) I'd say grumpy
has officially arrived.

06:42.327 --> 06:43.985
I heard that, Nancy.

06:45.221 --> 06:47.130
-I should get back to patrol.
-Uh-uh.

06:47.149 --> 06:49.149
I don't hear
no radios squawkin'.

06:49.225 --> 06:52.152
Nobody's leaving here
until the culprit is unmasked.

06:52.304 --> 06:54.746
Alright, look, how do you know
it wasn't somebody from B-shift?

06:54.898 --> 06:56.063
Deflecting much, TK?

06:56.158 --> 06:59.159
I know it wasn't B-shift,
because my man Gregg

06:59.235 --> 07:01.161
always takes the trash out
before we come in.

07:01.237 --> 07:02.829
MARJAN:
And what if Gregg forgot?

07:02.981 --> 07:06.499
I have rotated the chore chart
more than a few times recently.

07:06.652 --> 07:07.592
He didn't forget.

07:07.986 --> 07:09.928
And your fingerprints
are all over this, Marjan.

07:10.005 --> 07:11.430
I didn't eat
your pudding cup, Paul.

07:11.506 --> 07:12.597
I know you didn't,

07:12.933 --> 07:15.508
but your micromanagement
is the key to solving who did.

07:15.661 --> 07:18.511
Now, you recently
switched the positions

07:18.664 --> 07:20.922
of the trash can
and the recycle bin,
did you not?

07:20.999 --> 07:22.182
I did. Last Thursday.

07:22.334 --> 07:24.017
And this pudding cup

07:24.111 --> 07:25.610
was found in the trash.

07:25.687 --> 07:28.521
Now, I happen to know that
all of y'all in here recycle.

07:28.598 --> 07:32.025
So that means that
the guilty party was not aware

07:32.177 --> 07:33.860
that the bins
had been switched.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.012
So that leaves
only one suspect.

07:36.031 --> 07:38.123
Isn't that right,
Officer Reyes?

07:38.200 --> 07:40.333
(group snickering)

07:40.944 --> 07:41.960
Come on, Paul.

07:42.037 --> 07:44.111
Take off the tinfoil hat.

07:44.189 --> 07:45.780
-It wasn't Carlos.
-He's right. It was me.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.874
(all gasp)

07:47.951 --> 07:48.967
Babe.

07:49.619 --> 07:52.119
I could say I thought
it was community,

07:52.197 --> 07:53.638
but that would be a lie.

07:54.216 --> 07:57.701
The truth is, I was peckish
and I wanted pudding.

07:58.370 --> 08:00.645
And I didn't care
whose pudding I had to take

08:00.797 --> 08:02.296
in order to get it.

08:02.891 --> 08:04.524
(chuckling)
And you know what?

08:05.468 --> 08:06.226
It was delicious.

08:06.378 --> 08:07.377
-Monster!
-OWEN: Paul.

08:07.395 --> 08:08.820
You are a monster!
What?

08:08.972 --> 08:09.988
Could we have a word?

08:10.139 --> 08:11.381
GRACE RYDER:
"Looking for a reason

08:11.383 --> 08:12.732
"to bring charges
against Jesus,

08:12.901 --> 08:16.143
"they asked Him,
'Is it lawful to heal
on the Sabbath?'

08:16.163 --> 08:17.311
"He said to them,

08:17.331 --> 08:19.222
"'If any of you has a sheep

08:19.224 --> 08:21.315
"'and it falls into
a pit on the Sabbath,

08:21.335 --> 08:24.227
will you not take hold of it
and lift it out?'"

08:24.229 --> 08:25.337
Thank you, Grace.

08:25.413 --> 08:27.397
Now, what do we think
Jesus meant by that?

08:27.899 --> 08:29.758
He's sayin', watch your step.

08:30.827 --> 08:31.918
Thank you, Sister Lydia.

08:31.995 --> 08:33.920
I suppose that's true.
Anyone else?

08:34.072 --> 08:35.421
That people are better
than sheep.

08:35.574 --> 08:37.257
Okay, but I think
there's still more

08:37.333 --> 08:39.184
that we can mine
from this passage.

08:39.335 --> 08:43.079
Oh, I-I think Jesus meant
that there's a greater good

08:43.098 --> 08:45.415
than following
the letter of the law.

08:45.433 --> 08:48.401
And sometimes there are
folk with bad intent

08:48.511 --> 08:51.421
who will use a good law
to trip you up.

08:51.423 --> 08:53.106
TREVOR PARKS:
Excellent, Sister Vega.

08:53.182 --> 08:55.200
Spoken like
a true biblical scholar.

08:55.277 --> 08:57.427
-Oh, wow.
-Preacher's pet.

08:57.429 --> 08:58.853
TREVOR:
Uh, it is way past time.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.021
Why don't we close out
in prayer?

09:00.098 --> 09:01.498
TOMMY VEGA: Hm.

09:05.453 --> 09:09.138
So... Evie, Izzy,

09:09.140 --> 09:10.607
how did you enjoy the study?

09:10.609 --> 09:11.383
Mm. It was okay.

09:11.777 --> 09:13.126
-Hmm. I'll take "okay."
-(Tommy chuckles)

09:13.202 --> 09:14.944
Oh, Reverend Parks,

09:14.963 --> 09:16.112
you forgot your laundry
in our dryer.

17:29.107 --> 17:30.864

17:30.942 --> 17:32.124
He's taking the dog
for a walk.

17:32.201 --> 17:34.034
Yeah, and then he returns
about an hour later

17:34.054 --> 17:35.127
at 12:46.

17:35.388 --> 17:37.838
So what's that
supposed to prove exactly?

17:37.891 --> 17:39.223
I think that it's in that hour

17:39.300 --> 17:41.041
that he was dosed
with the neurotoxin

17:41.119 --> 17:42.209
that caused him
to get trapped in that chamber.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.637
-He seems fine.
-Yeah, he seems fine.

17:44.731 --> 17:45.730
But look.

17:47.400 --> 17:50.309
Oh, that's not a sad dog.
It's a sick dog.

17:50.737 --> 17:53.220
PAUL:
Exactly. I think something
happened in the time between

17:53.239 --> 17:55.298
when he left with the dog
and when he came back.

17:55.316 --> 17:56.982
GABRIEL:
So you're saying
whoever poisoned

17:57.135 --> 17:58.743
Brett Collier
poisoned the dog, too?

17:59.913 --> 18:01.395
So why is the dog still alive?

18:01.915 --> 18:03.155
Well, you said
it wasn't the poison

18:03.232 --> 18:04.624
that killed Brett, remember?

18:05.067 --> 18:06.417
Yeah.

18:07.145 --> 18:08.461
I said it to you.

18:09.480 --> 18:10.571
But it's true.

18:10.906 --> 18:13.149
The poison didn't kill him.
It just incapacitated him.

18:13.167 --> 18:15.426
You think the dog
met the killer?

18:15.987 --> 18:17.503

24:29.969 --> 24:30.968
He named one after you?

24:31.045 --> 24:32.803
It's a Nepenthes.

24:32.955 --> 24:34.379
Brett had a dark sense of humor.

24:34.456 --> 24:35.364
It's carnivorous.

24:35.533 --> 24:37.049
Not the most
flattering comparison

24:37.201 --> 24:38.867
a husband could make
concerning his wife.

24:38.869 --> 24:40.552
KENDRA:

Those are all the symptoms.

25:02.168 --> 25:04.001
GABRIEL:
What, the killer just
left it for us to find?

25:04.152 --> 25:06.003
That's convenient.
And I don't trust convenient.

25:06.080 --> 25:08.321
It's a greenhouse.
There'd be insecticide.

25:08.399 --> 25:10.749
Or maybe it has nothing
to do with our case.

25:11.493 --> 25:12.843
Alright, well, I'll just have
forensics sweep the place

25:12.920 --> 25:14.011
and test any toxins

25:14.162 --> 25:16.088
against what we found
in Mr. Collier's system.

25:16.164 --> 25:17.973
It's going to be a match.

25:19.835 --> 25:21.076
I know who did this.

25:21.095 --> 25:22.578
I know who killed
Kendra's husband.

25:22.596 --> 25:23.929
Who?

25:24.081 --> 25:25.080
Kendra's husband.

25:25.432 --> 25:27.525
GABRIEL: Really?
Kendra's husband.

25:27.676 --> 25:29.935
He killed himself.
How do you figure?

25:30.029 --> 25:31.195
Security footage showed him

25:31.272 --> 25:32.512
leaving his house
the morning of his death

25:33.032 --> 25:34.848
<i> and then returning</i>
<i> about an hour later.</i>

25:34.900 --> 25:36.534
I think he came here.

25:37.370 --> 25:40.262
I think after getting
his arm crushed under the SUV,

25:40.264 --> 25:43.332
he needed a little
horticulture therapy.

25:44.877 --> 25:46.544
Was your husband right-handed?

25:46.954 --> 25:48.295
Yes.

25:50.383 --> 25:52.274
So he was working
with one wing,

25:52.293 --> 25:53.458
<i> and it wasn't</i>
<i> his dominant one.</i>

25:53.611 --> 25:54.459
<i> So it looks like</i>

25:54.795 --> 25:56.536
he tried to fill
his little mister bottle here,

25:56.556 --> 25:57.537
<i> made a mess of it</i>

25:57.948 --> 25:59.557
<i> and got the contaminant</i>
<i> all over himself.</i>

25:59.633 --> 26:02.618
Now, an interesting fact about
carbamate-based toxins is

26:02.620 --> 26:05.045
they don't need to be ingested
for them to kill you.

26:05.122 --> 26:06.972
You get enough of it
on your skin, absorb it,

26:07.066 --> 26:08.307
it'll do the same thing.

26:08.459 --> 26:10.216
-It'll just take longer.
-(Owen chuckles)

26:10.236 --> 26:11.735
It's an interesting theory.

26:11.770 --> 26:12.736
PAUL:
More than a theory.

26:12.888 --> 26:14.363
We have a witness.

26:15.800 --> 26:17.575
-The dog.
-The dog.

26:18.911 --> 26:20.469
The dog didn't
get into the poison.

26:20.487 --> 26:22.228
<i> The poison got into the dog</i>

26:22.248 --> 26:23.897
<i> the same way</i>
<i> it got into Brett,</i>

26:23.974 --> 26:26.066
<i> through his skin.</i>

26:26.143 --> 26:27.993
-He pet the dog.
-Brett pet the dog.

26:28.329 --> 26:30.070
But by the time he did,

26:30.089 --> 26:31.830
he had already wiped
most of it off.

26:31.982 --> 26:33.406
Or rubbed it in.

26:33.426 --> 26:35.259
Which is why Brady
only got a little bit sick.

26:35.336 --> 26:37.595
But your husband absorbed
a significant amount.

26:38.489 --> 26:40.097
<i> I doubt he even really</i>
<i> realized anything was wrong</i>

26:40.324 --> 26:42.341
<i> until the paralytic took hold</i>
<i> and he couldn't breathe.</i>

26:42.493 --> 26:44.176
But by then it was too late,
and the only thing he could do,

26:44.252 --> 26:45.728
<i> was freeze to death.</i>

26:46.997 --> 26:49.014
(keypad beeping)

26:49.108 --> 26:50.833
-Who are you calling?
-(line ringing)

26:51.277 --> 26:54.320
The lab.
And the medical examiner.

26:55.597 --> 26:57.448
(line ringing)

27:01.846 --> 27:04.179
Well, I guess
whatever happened in Kansas

27:04.181 --> 27:05.271
must have been pretty bad.

27:05.291 --> 27:07.349
Well, it ended in divorce

27:07.368 --> 27:11.795
and caused him to relocate
to another state, so...

27:12.373 --> 27:14.539
Oh, Gracie, you were right.

27:14.616 --> 27:17.192
Gossip.
It's-it's an insidious thing.

27:17.327 --> 27:18.861
And it doesn't matter
if it's true or not.

27:19.530 --> 27:22.531
I mean, we may as well
have done the deed

27:22.549 --> 27:26.310
for all the good
our restraint did us.

27:27.796 --> 27:28.979
(sighs)

27:30.632 --> 27:32.441
Okay. Alright.

27:33.911 --> 27:35.544
Yes. Yes. Still pure.

27:35.562 --> 27:36.987
-Yeah.
-TOMMY: And still
nobody's business.

27:37.064 --> 27:38.322
GRACE:
Oh, yes, ma'am.

27:38.399 --> 27:41.733
Uh, you're right.
I never said it was.

27:41.827 --> 27:42.993
But, listen, I think I'm...

27:43.404 --> 27:46.238
I think I may have to start
shopping for a new home church.

27:46.832 --> 27:48.223
-Tommy. Stop it.
-T, come on.

27:48.225 --> 27:51.001
No, guys, no,
I-I-I can't go back there.

27:51.578 --> 27:54.672
No, y-- He couldn't look me
in the eye when he left.

27:55.174 --> 27:56.990
I'm supposed
to face that every Sunday?

27:57.568 --> 27:59.659
No, and, and who wants
to be lectured to...

28:00.495 --> 28:03.514

28:03.665 --> 28:06.466
I'm not sure we can say
that he dumped you, Tommy,

28:06.501 --> 28:09.687
because it sounds like
he's just having a weak moment,

28:09.763 --> 28:11.188
which doesn't mean...

28:12.266 --> 28:14.841
that you also
have to be having one.

28:14.860 --> 28:15.842
(Tommy sighs)

28:15.861 --> 28:17.611
(chuckles)

28:23.427 --> 28:25.093
Well, according to the ME,

28:25.095 --> 28:26.445
the insecticide
is a perfect match

28:26.597 --> 28:28.205
for the toxins found
in Brett's system.

28:28.356 --> 28:30.933
And the forensics lab just found
traces of it on the sling

28:30.951 --> 28:32.192
and the soft cast
he was wearing.

28:32.286 --> 28:34.786
Which confirms that Brett
poured it on himself.

28:34.939 --> 28:36.121
Exactly what Paul said.

28:36.273 --> 28:37.697
GABRIEL:
You knocked this outta the park,

28:37.717 --> 28:38.941
Firefighter Strickland.

28:38.959 --> 28:40.125
I told you he was the best.

28:40.611 --> 28:42.961
Uh, so-so what does this mean
for the investigation?

28:43.038 --> 28:44.613
It means
the investigation's over.

28:44.615 --> 28:47.474
We're officially ruling it
as an accidental death.

28:48.394 --> 28:49.952
You're free to go.

28:49.954 --> 28:51.395
(Kendra sighs)

28:52.714 --> 28:54.231
Thank you.

28:55.550 --> 28:57.359
-Thank you all.
-Oh, you're welcome.

29:00.388 --> 29:01.813
I'm very sorry for your loss.

29:01.966 --> 29:03.782
I appreciate that, Major.

29:05.393 --> 29:08.203
Hey, Owen, why don't you
uh, stick around a second?

29:12.067 --> 29:13.141
OWEN:
Well, I guess that proves

29:13.160 --> 29:14.476
that our training
isn't always right.

29:14.495 --> 29:16.979
Sometimes when there's smoke,
there is no fire,

29:16.997 --> 29:18.814
and you don't have to thank me.

29:18.816 --> 29:19.998
Thank you?

29:20.075 --> 29:21.407
What I'd like to do
is charge you.

29:21.427 --> 29:23.243
Charge me with what?
(scoffs)

29:23.262 --> 29:24.911
GABRIEL: How about interfering
with an investigation?

29:25.005 --> 29:26.246
Or obstruction of justice?

29:26.340 --> 29:28.265
Except if I do that,
I'd have to charge myself, too,

29:28.416 --> 29:30.250
because I'm the idiot
who trusted a guy

29:30.269 --> 29:32.603
not to wag his tongue
with confidential information.

29:32.754 --> 29:35.180
Come on, Gabriel.
No justice was obstructed here.

29:35.332 --> 29:36.940
Come on,
we solved the case for you.

29:37.759 --> 29:40.360
I mean, not that
you wouldn't have...
eventually.

29:43.340 --> 29:45.783
Like it or not, you and me,
we're gonna be related soon.

29:45.859 --> 29:46.950
So let's get one thing clear.

29:47.102 --> 29:50.012
The next time you decide
to go behind my back,

29:50.014 --> 29:52.664
you better have the<i> cojones</i>
to do it to my face.

29:54.868 --> 29:56.293
See you at the wedding.

30:03.861 --> 30:04.968
(knock on door)

30:09.791 --> 30:10.957
-Hey.
-Hi.

30:11.368 --> 30:13.535
Is that spare bedroom
still open?

30:13.537 --> 30:16.054
I don't think I can sleep alone
in that house tonight.

30:16.206 --> 30:17.523
Sure. Come in.

30:22.062 --> 30:23.378
KENDRA: And...

30:24.064 --> 30:26.565
just to get everything out
on the table,

30:26.717 --> 30:29.993
is it okay if for now
we keep things friends?

30:30.145 --> 30:31.236
I'd be shocked
if you didn't need time.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.646
And I never turn
my back on a friend.

30:33.724 --> 30:36.649
Particularly when the friend
is bringing booze.

30:36.727 --> 30:37.893
(Kendra chuckles)

30:37.895 --> 30:39.411
Actually, that's from Brett.

30:39.487 --> 30:42.064
I went back and opened
that gift bag we found.

30:42.066 --> 30:44.383
-OWEN: Mm-hmm?
-That's what was in it.

30:45.069 --> 30:46.068
London Dry. Nice.

30:46.161 --> 30:47.344
Brett and I met in London,

30:47.495 --> 30:50.013
and that's where
he first introduced me to it.

30:51.408 --> 30:53.475
I think we should
pour one out for Brett.

30:54.761 --> 30:56.186
I'd like that.

30:56.263 --> 30:57.729
I'll get the glasses.

30:59.433 --> 31:02.192
-(indistinct chatter)
-(clinks bottle)

31:02.269 --> 31:04.027
TK: I thought before
we start game night,

31:04.104 --> 31:06.755
we could make
a very special 126 toast

31:07.257 --> 31:09.274
-to the man of the hour, Paul.
-CARLOS: Hey!

31:09.351 --> 31:10.868
Come on, guys.
You don't have to do that.

31:11.019 --> 31:12.094
CARLOS:
Yes, we do.

31:12.112 --> 31:13.945
You keep an innocent woman
out of jail,

31:14.098 --> 31:15.038
raise a glass in your honor.

31:15.616 --> 31:18.100
And not for nothing.
You saved my dad's love life,
so...

31:18.118 --> 31:19.117
To Paul.

31:19.194 --> 31:20.711
The man who sees it all.

31:20.787 --> 31:22.270
(laughter)

31:22.272 --> 31:23.939
NANCY GILLIAN:
Hear, hear.

31:24.216 --> 31:26.258
Well, thank you.
I appreciate it.

31:27.945 --> 31:30.128
But you don't
seem happy about it.

31:30.222 --> 31:31.463
What's eating at you?

31:31.615 --> 31:32.614
I don't know,
it's... (sighs)

31:32.874 --> 31:34.282
You know, like,
when you just finish a puzzle

31:34.343 --> 31:35.951
and there's a piece missing

31:35.969 --> 31:37.119
and you just can't stop
thinking about it?

31:37.137 --> 31:39.287
Yeah. So what's
the missing piece?

31:39.306 --> 31:41.806
I don't know, it's just
buried in my brain.

31:41.883 --> 31:44.234
MATEO CHAVEZ:
Wait, you guys,
I just realized in this case,

31:44.386 --> 31:46.294
it actually was
the one-armed man that did it,

31:46.296 --> 31:47.571
but he did it to himself.

31:47.798 --> 31:49.147
It's kinda wild, right?

31:49.299 --> 31:50.908
NANCY:
Brett was an odd duck,

31:51.059 --> 31:52.558
but he seemed like a nice guy.

31:52.636 --> 31:55.895
Yeah. I mean, who rotates
their wife's tires?

31:55.897 --> 31:56.914
Now, that's true love.

31:57.641 --> 31:59.991
(Paul chuckles)
Well, it was
her birthday, so...

32:00.144 --> 32:01.977
Baby, if you ever decide

32:01.995 --> 32:03.236
that it's
an appropriate birthday gift

32:03.255 --> 32:04.813
to rotate my tires,

32:04.831 --> 32:05.981
know that it is not.

32:05.999 --> 32:07.240
TK:
Alright, Paul, set it up.

32:07.259 --> 32:08.908
No, it was her birthday.

32:08.928 --> 32:10.168
-What?
-Her birthday! That's it. Th--

32:10.245 --> 32:11.319
I found the last piece.

32:11.321 --> 32:13.655
-Oh, my God.
-(keypad beeping)

32:13.657 --> 32:14.765

32:22.516 --> 32:24.608
Hey, uh, listen, you gotta
get a hold of Kendra.

32:24.685 --> 32:26.109
-What's going on?
-PAUL (on phone):
<i> Remember that bottle</i>

32:26.261 --> 32:28.520
of birthday something
that she found
stashed in her bedroom?

32:28.614 --> 32:30.113
Uh, yeah?

32:30.265 --> 32:32.199
PAUL:
<i> Yeah, tell her not to open it.</i>

32:34.361 --> 32:36.678
-OWEN: Why?
-PAUL:<i> Because I think</i>
<i> Brett poisoned it.</i>

32:36.680 --> 32:38.346
<i> I think he was trying</i>
<i> to kill her all along.</i>

32:38.348 --> 32:40.457
<i> -Do not let her drink it.</i>
-She just did.

32:40.608 --> 32:41.959
-What?
-PAUL:<i> Wait a minute.</i>
<i> What? What? She's with you?</i>

32:42.035 --> 32:43.794
KENDRA:
Oh... (clears throat)

32:43.870 --> 32:46.021
-PAUL:<i> Hey, Cap.</i>
-Owen, I...

32:46.023 --> 32:47.130
I don't feel so...

32:47.282 --> 32:49.115
Oh. Owen. (gasps)

32:49.134 --> 32:50.133
I don't... (gasps)

32:50.210 --> 32:51.617

-(choking)
-Look at me. Look at me.
Can you?

32:55.365 --> 32:57.549
Uh, Mateo, Mateo,
I need you to call 9-1-1, okay?

32:57.701 --> 32:59.643
Tell them to send a RA unit
to Captain Strand's house

32:59.720 --> 33:02.145
and tell them they have a victim
who just ingested a lethal dose

33:02.297 --> 33:04.147
of carbamate-based insecticide.

33:04.299 --> 33:05.298
Alright, yo, Cap.

33:05.317 --> 33:06.558
OWEN:
Kendra, Kendra, it's okay.

33:06.710 --> 33:07.985
-PAUL:<i> Captain Strand?</i>
-Look at me. Look at me.

33:08.061 --> 33:09.820
-Can you hear me?
-Owen, I... (gasps)

33:09.896 --> 33:11.213
-PAUL:<i> Hey, Cap.</i>
-Call 9-1-1!

33:11.215 --> 33:12.656
Cap, I already did.
Okay, rescue's on the way.

33:12.733 --> 33:15.217
And in the meantime,
I have Nancy and TK here, okay?

33:15.219 --> 33:17.577
Dad. What's her symptoms?
Is she still conscious?

33:18.146 --> 33:19.145
Okay. (shushing)

33:19.239 --> 33:20.998
-Okay. It's alright.
-TK:<i> Dad?</i>

33:21.074 --> 33:23.074
Eyes are open.
Pupils are pinpoint.

33:23.168 --> 33:25.485
She's losing motor function
pretty quickly.

33:25.504 --> 33:26.911
NANCY:
<i> That's the paralytic</i>
<i> taking hold.</i>

33:27.064 --> 33:28.171
You need to turn her head
to the side

33:28.323 --> 33:29.655
to make sure she doesn't choke.

33:29.657 --> 33:30.674
Um...

33:30.751 --> 33:33.159
-(gasping)
-Okay. Done.

33:33.178 --> 33:34.994
NANCY:<i> Alright.</i>
<i> So how's her breathing?</i>

33:35.014 --> 33:36.513
<i> Do you see her chest rising?</i>

33:39.018 --> 33:41.743
Respiration's slowing.

33:41.762 --> 33:43.854
(dramatic music playing)

33:43.930 --> 33:45.272
Kendra!

33:46.099 --> 33:47.098
She stopped breathing.

33:47.175 --> 33:48.250
Yo, Mateo, where's the bus?

33:48.268 --> 33:49.693
They're saying three minutes.

33:50.696 --> 33:51.770
Starting rescue breaths.

33:51.846 --> 33:53.438
Whoa, Dad, Dad, do not do that.

33:53.590 --> 33:55.440
The poison is on her lips.
It will kill you, too.

33:55.592 --> 33:57.701
Then tell 'em to get ready
for two victims.

33:58.095 --> 33:59.327

34:01.448 --> 34:02.264

36:57.123 --> 36:59.582
-In the cryo chamber.
-(beeps)

36:59.659 --> 37:00.700
The other one.

37:01.220 --> 37:03.553
Oh. When-when he spilled
the-the poison on himself.

37:03.705 --> 37:04.888
Before that.

37:04.965 --> 37:06.556
In the... car?

37:06.783 --> 37:07.949
Yes.

37:07.951 --> 37:09.117
I always found it odd

37:09.135 --> 37:10.969
that a guy worth
over a billion dollars

37:11.045 --> 37:12.395
was rotating his own tires.

37:12.547 --> 37:13.546
Except he wasn't.

37:13.715 --> 37:16.307
Kendra was the only one
who drove that car.

37:16.735 --> 37:18.235
So then it dawned on me,

37:18.311 --> 37:21.321
what if he was actually
trying to cut the brake line?

37:22.074 --> 37:23.073
The bolt cutters.

37:23.224 --> 37:24.466
PAUL:
<i> It would explain why his arm</i>

37:24.559 --> 37:26.134
<i> -got crushed by the chassis...</i>
-(Brett screaming)

37:26.136 --> 37:26.892
PAUL:
<i> ...and not the wheel well.</i>

37:26.912 --> 37:27.911
It's an interesting theory.

37:28.062 --> 37:29.929
KENDRA:
After Paul walked me through it,

37:30.006 --> 37:31.081
I checked with the mechanic.

37:31.232 --> 37:32.323
It's confirmed.

37:32.476 --> 37:33.583
Brakes were cut.

37:33.693 --> 37:36.127
And he only had to
walk you through this once?

37:37.814 --> 37:42.116
So, I-I understand
how the bolt cutters
get you to the car,

37:42.152 --> 37:44.744
but how does the car
get you to the gin bottle?

37:44.763 --> 37:47.747
I just figured if a guy
is trying to murder his wife,

37:47.766 --> 37:50.308
why would he buy her
an expensive bottle of gin
for her birthday?

37:51.328 --> 37:53.103
To be used
in the next attempt.

37:53.179 --> 37:55.346
And the bottom circumference
of that type of gin bottle

37:55.499 --> 37:58.090
<i> just happens to be</i>
<i> 9.42 centimeters,</i>

37:58.110 --> 37:59.759
<i> which is about the same size</i>
<i> as that ring stain</i>

37:59.836 --> 38:01.002
<i> we found on his work table.</i>

38:01.095 --> 38:03.763
So I was right about
how he spilled it on him,

38:03.840 --> 38:05.340
<i> just wrong about</i>
<i> what he was spilling it into.</i>

38:05.342 --> 38:07.358
Thank God for you,
Strickland.

38:08.178 --> 38:09.286
Okay, so what about motive?

38:09.437 --> 38:11.621
You don't need to prove motive
to close a case.

38:11.773 --> 38:13.623
Yeah, but the ending isn't
as satisfying without one.

38:13.775 --> 38:16.351
Well, I mean, I can think of
about two billion motives.

38:16.353 --> 38:19.203
KENDRA: He didn't
do it for the money.

38:19.280 --> 38:21.423
He did it because he loved me.

38:23.026 --> 38:25.360
And he finally realized
I didn't love him.

38:25.362 --> 38:26.544
Something changed.

38:26.713 --> 38:30.432
Owen walked into my world,
and things kinda blew up.

38:32.144 --> 38:33.701
GABRIEL:
Owen tends to have that effect.

38:33.720 --> 38:36.554
But then when
the chips are down,
he comes through.

38:36.631 --> 38:38.815
The last time we spoke,
I implied that you were

38:38.966 --> 38:40.800
lacking in intestinal fortitude.

38:40.877 --> 38:42.152
Clearly, I was wrong.

38:42.303 --> 38:44.804
Yeah, I think the word
you used was<i> "cojones."</i>

38:44.823 --> 38:46.156
That does sound more like you.

38:46.232 --> 38:47.807
(Gabriel chuckles)

38:48.234 --> 38:50.401
Well, peace offering.

38:51.330 --> 38:53.071
-You can check the seal.
-OWEN: I'll do you better.

38:53.223 --> 38:54.405
Why don't you take
the first drink?

38:54.482 --> 38:56.333
-(Gabriel laughs)
-You know, Gabriel, I think

38:56.409 --> 38:58.626
we're gonna be
great<i> consuegros.</i>

38:59.671 --> 39:00.912

39:00.988 --> 39:01.913

39:02.065 --> 39:03.155

39:03.233 --> 39:04.582

PARISHIONER: Amen!

39:49.446 --> 39:52.889

40:13.836 --> 40:15.328

40:17.231 --> 40:20.324
You won't mind if I do
the reading today, will you?

40:21.068 --> 40:23.086
I feel the Holy Spirit
calling me.

40:24.164 --> 40:25.547
Thank you, Reverend.

40:27.259 --> 40:28.816
(Tommy inhales deeply)

40:28.818 --> 40:30.075
I woke up this morning

40:30.095 --> 40:33.321
with some passages
in my head

40:33.339 --> 40:35.840
that I, uh, I hope
will inspire you all

40:35.917 --> 40:37.475
this fine morning.

40:38.511 --> 40:39.561
Enjoy.

40:42.515 --> 40:47.318
"They learn to be idle
wandering from house to house.

40:48.672 --> 40:54.099
"And not only idle
but tattlers speaking things

40:54.119 --> 40:55.994
"which they ought not.

40:56.938 --> 40:59.180
"Keep thy tongue from evil

40:59.624 --> 41:02.350
"and thy lips

"Whoever secretly slanders
his neighbor,

"him, I will destroy.

41:09.359 --> 41:12.043
"The one who has
a haughty look

41:12.195 --> 41:14.212
"and a proud heart,

41:14.364 --> 41:17.265
him, I will not endure."

41:18.535 --> 41:21.369
Which, I-I think is-is
God's way of saying,

41:21.387 --> 41:24.038
"If you can't say
something nice,

41:24.040 --> 41:25.723
keep your damn mouth shut."

41:30.230 --> 41:33.064
Oh, and you,

I can't ever remember.

41:34.809 --> 41:36.050
-(murmuring)
-Uh, Tommy?

41:36.069 --> 41:37.619
I'm not finished.

41:43.835 --> 41:45.168
Out there in the world,

41:45.319 --> 41:48.913
there is plenty of pain
and tragedy

41:48.990 --> 41:51.657
and just plain meanness
to go around.

41:51.676 --> 41:52.491
(mouthing)

41:52.585 --> 41:56.754
I see it every day on the job.

41:56.831 --> 41:58.389
I'm out there fighting it.

41:59.500 --> 42:01.425
But when we come
through those doors,

42:01.578 --> 42:04.687
we should leave
those things outside.

42:06.340 --> 42:10.026
I shouldn't feel like
I have to fight it in here too.

42:10.177 --> 42:12.445
But I will.

42:14.366 --> 42:18.117
But what I will not do
is I will not be shamed.

42:19.262 --> 42:22.263
And I will not be driven
from this place.

42:22.282 --> 42:25.266

Alright.
