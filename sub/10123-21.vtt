09:31.367 --> 09:33.900
JUST IN CASE I CAN'T FAKE
AN INTEREST IN SOMETHING.

09:33.900 --> 09:34.934
SENSE OF HUMOR.

09:34.934 --> 09:37.734
NO PROBLEM.
I'M A REGULAR LAUGH RIOT.

09:37.734 --> 09:40.200
ALL RIGHT, SO HOW DO I
SELECT A LUCKY GIRL?

09:40.200 --> 09:41.734
WELL,
JUST THINK OF SOMEONE

09:41.734 --> 09:43.133
YOU'RE COMPLETELY
COMFORTABLE WITH,

09:43.133 --> 09:45.500
SOMEONE YOU COULD
SHARE A MEAL WITH,

09:45.500 --> 09:48.767
AND SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T
MIND HAVING YOU AROUND.

09:48.767 --> 09:52.400
WELL, MY MOM'S
ALREADY TAKEN.

09:52.400 --> 09:55.600
CORY, JUST GO FOR
THE FIRST THING IN A DRESS.

09:55.600 --> 09:58.300
A DRESS.

09:58.300 --> 09:59.300
A DRESS.

09:59.300 --> 10:00.300
A DRESS.

10:00.300 --> 10:01.734
A DRESS.

10:03.100 --> 10:04.100
TOPANGA.

10:04.100 --> 10:05.400
YES, CORY?

10:05.400 --> 10:08.734
SO, WHAT'S INTERESTING
IN YOUR LIFE RIGHT NOW?

10:08.734 --> 10:10.600
WELL, MERCURY
IS IN RETROGRADE,

10:10.600 --> 10:12.567
MAKING PROJECTS
DIFFICULT TO COMPLETE

10:12.567 --> 10:15.367
AND CAUSING GENERAL
CHAOS IN THE UNIVERSE.

10:18.233 --> 10:20.567
YOU KNOW, NOT ONLY IS THAT
UNBELIEVABLY INTERESTING,

10:20.567 --> 10:23.100
IT REMINDS ME
OF A JOKE I ONCE HEARD.

10:23.100 --> 10:25.300
HOW DID THE ASTROLOGER
CROSS THE ROAD?

10:25.300 --> 10:26.300
I DON'T KNOW.

10:26.300 --> 10:27.600
IN HIS TAURUS.

10:30.100 --> 10:31.767
BUT I KID THE ZODIAC.

10:31.767 --> 10:33.033
UM, WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO

10:33.033 --> 10:35.467
TO BOB STUBCHECK'S
BURGER WORLD AFTER SCHOOL?

10:35.467 --> 10:37.700
CORY,
I'M A VEGETARIAN.

10:37.700 --> 10:39.200
OF COURSE YOU ARE.

10:39.200 --> 10:40.667
THAT'S WHY WE'RE JUST GOING
TO MEET AT BURGER WORLD

10:40.667 --> 10:43.400
AND WALK OVER TO
INTERNATIONAL HOUSE OF SALADS.

10:43.400 --> 10:45.567
I LOVE IHOS.

10:45.567 --> 10:47.667
WHO DOESN'T?

10:47.667 --> 10:51.667
OK. GEE, I WONDER WHAT
THE SPROUT OF THE DAY IS.

10:51.667 --> 10:53.200
WHO CARES?
YOU CAN'T GO WRONG

10:53.200 --> 10:56.834
WITH A NICE BOWL
OF SPAGHETTI AND SPROUT BALLS.

10:56.834 --> 10:58.800
SO, I'LL JUST MEET YOU
AT 4:30.

10:58.800 --> 11:00.200
OK, IT'S A DATE.

11:00.200 --> 11:04.300
A DATE? WHO SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT A DATE?

11:04.300 --> 11:06.900
WHAT HAVE I DONE?

11:22.867 --> 11:24.400
OK.

11:24.400 --> 11:26.233
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
THAT I DON'T KNOW?

11:26.233 --> 11:27.567
NOTHING.

11:29.800 --> 11:31.467
WHICH KID IS IT?

11:31.467 --> 11:32.767
CORY.

11:32.767 --> 11:34.200
OH, I KNEW IT.

11:34.200 --> 11:35.567
OK, OK.
LET'S SEE.

11:35.567 --> 11:37.567
HE'S TOO OLD
TO STEAL CANDY,

11:37.567 --> 11:39.033
BUT TOO YOUNG
TO WRECK A CAR.

11:41.867 --> 11:44.100
OH, NO.
IT'S A GIRL.

11:44.100 --> 11:45.200
IT IS.

11:45.200 --> 11:46.867
CORY IS GOING
ON HIS FIRST DATE.

11:46.867 --> 11:48.767
ISN'T THAT SWEET?

11:48.767 --> 11:52.000
YEAH.
POOR SLOB.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.300
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

11:54.300 --> 11:56.100
YOU'RE HIS FATHER.
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD.

11:56.100 --> 11:57.934
HEY, I'VE BEEN
ON THE GUY SIDE OF DATING.

11:57.934 --> 12:00.867
I MEAN, HE'S FINE NOW, BUT
HE'S JUST A STEP AWAY FROM...

12:00.867 --> 12:04.100
HUH-HUH-HUH-HUH-HUH.

12:04.100 --> 12:06.900
DATING WAS ALWAYS
FUN FOR ME.

12:06.900 --> 12:08.934
I REMEMBER
TALKING ON THE PHONE

12:08.934 --> 12:10.734
TO 8 DIFFERENT GUYS
A NIGHT.

12:10.734 --> 12:12.400
YEAH, WELL, THE ONLY WAY
I SURVIVED IT

12:12.400 --> 12:14.133
WAS KNOWING THAT
ONE DAY I'D BE MARRIED

12:14.133 --> 12:15.867
AND I'D BE
CALLING THE SHOTS.

12:15.867 --> 12:20.033
HONEY, I'M SO SORRY THINGS
DIDN'T WORK OUT FOR YOU.

12:20.033 --> 12:22.667
I WONDER IF
I CAN STILL WARN HIM

12:22.667 --> 12:25.133
ABOUT THE MINEFIELD
HE'S ABOUT TO STEP INTO

12:25.133 --> 12:26.400
WITHOUT RUINING HIS LIFE.

12:26.400 --> 12:28.767
WELL, CORY DOESN'T
APPEAR TO BE SUFFERING

12:28.767 --> 12:29.934
LIKE YOU DID.

12:29.934 --> 12:32.133
HE'S ACTUALLY EXCITED
ABOUT THIS DATE.

12:32.133 --> 12:34.100
I OVERHEARD HIM
TELLING SHAWN

12:34.100 --> 12:36.033
THAT HE COULDN'T
PLAY BASKETBALL TODAY

12:36.033 --> 12:38.100
BECAUSE HE WAS
GOING OUT WITH TOPANGA.

12:38.100 --> 12:39.600
TOPANGA?

12:39.600 --> 12:42.133
CORY'S ALWAYS TEASING,
MAKING FUN OF HER.

12:43.767 --> 12:45.967
OH, NO.
THIS IS BAD.

12:48.867 --> 12:49.800
HI, MOM.
HI, DAD.

12:49.800 --> 12:52.367
CORY, I THINK
THIS IS SO WONDERFUL.

12:52.367 --> 12:55.500
SON, THIS IS THE STUPIDEST
THING YOU'VE EVER DONE.

12:55.500 --> 12:58.200
BEFORE I SHOOT MYSELF
IN THE FOOT,

12:58.200 --> 13:00.300
WHICH STUPID THING
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

13:00.300 --> 13:02.233
YOUR DATE WITH TOPANGA.

13:02.233 --> 13:04.200
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

13:04.200 --> 13:06.500
EVERYTHING STARTED
GETTING ALL FUZZY

13:06.500 --> 13:07.667
AFTER THAT
TELEGRAM MOVIE.

13:07.667 --> 13:10.000
NOT THE HORMONAL TELEGRAM.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
ARE THEY STILL
SHOWING THAT FILM?

13:12.000 --> 13:13.834
I CRIED DURING
THAT MOVIE.

13:13.834 --> 13:14.834
IF IT WASN'T
FOR THAT MOVIE,

13:14.834 --> 13:16.400
I'D STILL BE 12.

13:16.400 --> 13:18.834
YEAH, IT HAD A WEIRD EFFECT
ON A LOT OF PEOPLE.

13:18.834 --> 13:19.834
BUT EVER SINCE
WE SAW IT,

13:19.834 --> 13:21.967
PEOPLE ARE DOING
REALLY STRANGE THINGS.

13:21.967 --> 13:23.200
WELL,
YOU CERTAINLY ARE.

13:23.200 --> 13:24.734
YOU'VE NEVER ASKED
A GIRL OUT BEFORE.

13:24.734 --> 13:26.400
YEAH, WELL,
NEITHER DID SHAWN.

13:27.834 --> 13:29.200
DID YOU ASK
TOPANGA OUT

13:29.200 --> 13:30.567
SO YOU COULD
KEEP UP WITH HIM?

13:31.900 --> 13:33.300
WHOA. THAT'S WEIRD.

13:33.300 --> 13:35.033
HOW DID SHE KNOW?

13:36.834 --> 13:38.300
IT'S THE SORORITY
OF SATAN.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.667
WELL, COR, AS MUCH AS
I WANTED TO SEE YOU

13:42.667 --> 13:45.100
GO OUT ON
YOUR FIRST LITTLE DATE,

13:45.100 --> 13:46.867
I DON'T THINK
IT'S FAIR TO TOPANGA.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
AS MUCH AS I WANTED
TO SEE IT, TOO,

13:51.000 --> 13:52.500
I--I THINK
YOUR MOTHER'S RIGHT.

13:52.500 --> 13:53.967
YOU SHOULD CANCEL...
NOW.

13:55.200 --> 13:56.400
MOM, DAD,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.700
WITH WOMEN, HONESTY
IS THE BEST POLICY.

14:01.033 --> 14:04.667
AND HE THINKS
HE'S READY TO DATE.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.400
HI. IS TOPANGA THERE?

14:13.400 --> 14:15.600
YEAH, I DID MEAN PHYSICALLY.

14:15.600 --> 14:17.734
HI, TOPANGA.
IT'S ME--CORY MATTHEWS.

14:17.734 --> 14:20.100
YOU PROBABLY
REMEMBER ME FROM SCHOOL.

14:20.100 --> 14:24.400
YEAH. WELL, LISTEN,
WHEN I MADE THIS DATE,

14:24.400 --> 14:26.934
I DIDN'T KNOW IT
AT THAT TIME,

14:26.934 --> 14:29.100
BUT NOW I JUST
FOUND OUT.

14:29.100 --> 14:31.700
TOPANGA, I GOT TO BE
TOTALLY HONEST WITH YOU.

14:31.700 --> 14:33.500
[COUGHS]

14:33.500 --> 14:35.567
I GOT THE FLU,
AND I CAN'T GO OUT.

14:38.800 --> 14:39.967
I FEEL FINE ABOUT THAT.

14:44.367 --> 14:45.767
FALL-AWAY JUMPER
AT THE BUZZER.

14:45.767 --> 14:47.600
GOOD IF IT GOES.

14:47.600 --> 14:50.000
3-POINTER! YES!
SIXERS WIN!

14:50.000 --> 14:53.600
WHOO! WHOO!
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

14:53.600 --> 14:55.700
WHOO! WHOO! WHOO!

14:55.700 --> 14:58.000
WHOO.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.500
HI, CORY.
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

15:00.500 --> 15:03.700
UH, CLAMMY.
VERY FLUISH. YEAH.

15:03.700 --> 15:06.500
IT'S VERY CONTAGIOUS.
YOU BETTER GET OUT OF HERE.

15:06.500 --> 15:08.600
HERE. DRINK THIS.

15:08.600 --> 15:10.233
IT'LL DETOXIFY
YOUR AURA.

15:12.200 --> 15:14.233
WHAT IS IT?
IT'S CALLED BANCHA TEA.

15:16.300 --> 15:19.600
SMELLS LIKE
A BANCHA GYM SOCKS.

15:19.600 --> 15:21.033
CORY, IT'S A REMEDY

15:21.033 --> 15:22.667
THAT'S BEEN USED
FOR CENTURIES.

15:22.667 --> 15:26.934
"BEST IF USED BEFORE
LINCOLN'S ASSASSINATION."

15:28.000 --> 15:31.233
I JUST WANTED TO
HELP YOU FEEL BETTER.

15:31.233 --> 15:34.367
I'M SORRY
IF I BOTHERED YOU.

15:34.367 --> 15:35.500
WAIT, TOPANGA.

15:35.500 --> 15:37.900
THANKS FOR BRINGING
THE TEA, BUT...

15:37.900 --> 15:39.000
I DON'T NEED
TO DRINK IT

15:39.000 --> 15:40.934
'CAUSE I'M NOT
TECHNICALLY SICK.

15:40.934 --> 15:44.000
THEN WHY DID YOU
SAY YOU WERE?

15:44.000 --> 15:47.200
WELL, I GUESS BECAUSE
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU.

15:47.200 --> 15:49.967
I'M NOT READY
TO GO OUT ON A DATE YET.

15:49.967 --> 15:51.700
THAT'S OK.

15:51.700 --> 15:54.867
JEDIDIAH AND CHLOE
HAVE ALWAYS TOLD ME,

15:54.867 --> 15:57.233
"LISTEN TO
YOUR INNER VOICE.

15:57.233 --> 16:00.066
IT'LL LET YOU KNOW
WHAT IS TRUE FOR YOU."

16:00.066 --> 16:02.033
YEAH. MY PARENTS
SAID THAT, TOO.

16:02.033 --> 16:04.200
ONLY THEY SAID IT
WITHOUT ALL THE PLANETS

16:04.200 --> 16:05.500
CIRCLING
AROUND THEIR HEADS.

16:08.567 --> 16:10.667
SO I'LL SEE YOU
AT SCHOOL?

16:10.667 --> 16:12.000
YEAH...

16:12.000 --> 16:13.400
UNLESS FEENY
MOVES MY SEAT.

16:16.233 --> 16:17.667
YEAH.

16:18.767 --> 16:20.734
WELL, I GUESS
I BETTER BE GOING.

16:20.734 --> 16:23.100
AND I GUESS
I'LL BE STAYING HERE.

16:31.400 --> 16:33.734
MAY I ASK YOU
A PERSONAL QUESTION?

16:38.600 --> 16:39.500
SURE.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.967
WHY ARE THERE SOCKS
ALL OVER YOUR FLOOR?

16:42.967 --> 16:44.500
OH.

16:44.500 --> 16:45.567
I WAS JUST PRACTICING.

16:46.934 --> 16:49.300
I ENVY
YOUR ATHLETIC ABILITY.

16:49.300 --> 16:50.667
OH, THIS?
IT'S NOT SO HARD.

16:50.667 --> 16:52.867
COME ON, I'LL GIVE YOU
SOME POINTERS.

16:52.867 --> 16:54.467
ALL RIGHT. FIRST,
YOU GRAB SOME AMMO.

17:00.734 --> 17:02.367
NINJA TURTLES?

17:02.367 --> 17:03.367
AND NOW THEY'RE GONE.

17:03.367 --> 17:04.967
UM, ANYWAY,

17:04.967 --> 17:06.500
THE KEY IS GOOD
COLOR COMMENTARY.

17:06.500 --> 17:08.767
IF YOU CAN LIVE UP
TO YOUR OWN HYPE,

17:08.767 --> 17:09.767
YOU GOT IT MADE.

17:09.767 --> 17:11.100
WATCH THIS.

17:11.100 --> 17:13.934
MATTHEWS SEES AN OPEN LANE.
HE DRIVES HARD TO THE BOARDS.

17:13.934 --> 17:16.200
HE LEAPS OVER
SHAQUILLE O'NEAL,

17:16.200 --> 17:18.100
KISSES IT
OFF THE GLASS!

17:18.100 --> 17:19.133
IT'S GOOD!

17:19.133 --> 17:20.834
HE SCORES!

17:20.834 --> 17:22.367
I COULD NEVER DO THAT.

17:22.367 --> 17:23.967
SURE YOU CAN.
GIVE IT A TRY.

17:23.967 --> 17:26.500
BUT I'M NOT FAMILIAR
WITH THE TERMINOLOGY.

17:26.500 --> 17:27.500
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL DO THE COLOR.

17:27.500 --> 17:28.767
YOU JUST WORRY ABOUT

17:28.767 --> 17:30.600
GETTING THE BALL
IN THE BASKET.

17:30.600 --> 17:32.000
TOPANGA'S TRIPLE-TEAMED
AT THE TIME LINE.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.233
SHE BREAKS THE TRAP,
HEADS TO THE TOP OF THE KEY,

17:34.233 --> 17:35.400
AND LEAPS
TOWARD THE BASKET,

17:35.400 --> 17:38.734
DOING A SPIRALING
TOMAHAWK 360!

17:38.734 --> 17:40.900
SLAM DUNK!

17:48.967 --> 17:52.800
LOOK. WE BOTH
MADE A BASKET.

17:54.200 --> 17:56.000
TECHNICALLY, YEAH,
BUT, UH...

17:56.000 --> 17:58.967
BASKETBALL'S SO MUCH MORE
FUN WHEN YOU ACTUALLY MOVE.

17:58.967 --> 18:00.734
ALL RIGHT, YOU TRY
AND MAKE ANOTHER BASKET,

18:00.734 --> 18:02.467
AND I'LL TRY
AND BLOCK YOU.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.300
WAY TO GO, TOPANGA.

18:19.934 --> 18:21.900
HUH-HUH-HUH-HUH-HUH.

18:23.033 --> 18:24.400
HUH-HUH-HUH-HUH.

18:28.467 --> 18:32.200
IT'S NICE THAT YOU HELP
YOUR FATHER WITH THE LAUNDRY.

18:32.200 --> 18:35.100
YEAH, WELL, WE'RE A FAIRLY
CUTTING-EDGE FAMILY,

18:35.100 --> 18:37.300
SO, UH, MY MOM DOES
MOST OF THE LAUNDRY.

18:37.300 --> 18:38.300
I'M JUST HELPING OUT

18:38.300 --> 18:39.867
BECAUSE MOTHER'S DAY
IS COMING UP.

18:39.867 --> 18:42.400
SO YOU'RE DOING CHORES
FOR YOUR MOTHER'S DAY GIFT?

18:42.400 --> 18:45.834
YOU THINK I COULD
GET AWAY WITH THAT?

18:45.834 --> 18:47.000
WHAT ARE YOU
GETTING YOUR MOM?

18:47.000 --> 18:48.467
I COULD USE SOME IDEAS.

18:48.467 --> 18:51.100
AT OUR HOUSE, WE DON'T
CELEBRATE MOTHER'S DAY.

18:51.100 --> 18:53.800
WE FEEL IT'S MERELY
A COMMERCIAL FABRICATION

18:53.800 --> 18:55.600
OF THE GREETING CARD
INDUSTRY.

18:55.600 --> 18:58.400
SHE HAS, HOWEVER,
ASKED FOR A DUST BUSTER.

18:58.400 --> 19:01.800
MY MOM'S PRETTY WELL SET
FOR SMALL APPLIANCES,

19:01.800 --> 19:04.100
AND MY FUNDS
ARE SORT OF LIMITED.

19:04.100 --> 19:05.133
YOU DON'T NEED MONEY.

19:05.133 --> 19:08.033
YOU JUST NEED TO USE
YOUR RIGHT BRAIN.

19:08.033 --> 19:09.400
WOW.

19:09.400 --> 19:12.500
ALL THESE YEARS I'VE BEEN
USING THE WRONG ONE.

19:12.500 --> 19:14.734
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD GET MY MOM?

19:14.734 --> 19:17.967
YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG
WITH SOMETHING FROM THE HEART.

19:17.967 --> 19:20.600
RIGHT OR LEFT HEART?

19:20.600 --> 19:22.734
YOU'RE KILLING ME,
CORY.

19:22.734 --> 19:25.467
HUH-HUH-HUH-HUH-HUH.

19:25.467 --> 19:27.300
HUH-HUH-HUH-HUH-HUH.

19:31.367 --> 19:32.400
<i>Shawn: </i>
<i>HEY, GUYS. </i>

19:32.400 --> 19:34.233
THERE HE IS--
YOUNG ME.

19:34.233 --> 19:35.567
HOW WAS
YOUR SECOND DATE?

19:35.567 --> 19:36.934
YOU HAD ANOTHER DATE?

19:36.934 --> 19:38.567
YEAH.

19:38.567 --> 19:39.834
MY LAST ONE.

19:39.834 --> 19:41.100
AH, SECOND-DATE
SLUMP.

19:41.100 --> 19:44.100
I'VE SEEN IT HAPPEN
A THOUSAND TIMES.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.600
NOT TO ME.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.133
YOU KNOW,

19:47.133 --> 19:49.233
YOU KNOW, I'M THINKING
IT'S DEEPER THAN THAT.

19:49.233 --> 19:50.734
SEE, EACH ONE OF US
IS BORN

19:50.734 --> 19:52.200
WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT
OF COOLNESS.

19:52.200 --> 19:53.500
NOW, A GUY LIKE MINKUS

19:53.500 --> 19:54.567
COULD LIVE TO BE
1,000 YEARS OLD

19:54.567 --> 19:56.467
AND NEVER USE
A DROP OF HIS COOL.

19:56.467 --> 20:00.667
ME--I'M A 13-YEAR-OLD
BURNOUT.

20:00.667 --> 20:03.000
SHAWN, GET A GRIP.
YOU'RE STILL COOL.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.700
IT'S JUST THE PLANET
MERCURY IN RETROSPECT.

20:07.100 --> 20:08.567
WHAT ARE YOU
BABBLING ABOUT?

20:08.567 --> 20:11.967
SOME ASTROLOGY THING.
TOPANGA WAS EXPLAINING IT TO ME.

20:11.967 --> 20:14.467
HEY, THAT'S RIGHT.
HOW WAS YOUR DATE?

20:14.467 --> 20:17.767
WHAT DATE? I DIDN'T HAVE
A DATE. I CANCELED IT.

20:17.767 --> 20:19.700
OH, COME ON, COR. WHEN
I GOT HOME FROM WORK,

20:19.700 --> 20:22.700
YOU AND TOPANGA
WERE LOOKING COZY
ON THE COUCH THERE.

20:22.700 --> 20:23.834
THAT WAS NOT A DATE.

20:23.834 --> 20:25.734
SHE JUST CAME OVER
TO BRING ME SOME AURA JUICE.

20:25.734 --> 20:27.300
AND?

20:27.300 --> 20:28.900
AND NOTHING. I TAUGHT HER
HOW TO SHOOT A BASKET.

20:28.900 --> 20:30.567
OK, SO LET'S RECAP.

20:30.567 --> 20:32.033
POINT "A,"
SHE BROUGHT REFRESHMENTS.

20:32.033 --> 20:34.200
POINT "B,"
YOU CHOSE THE ACTIVITY.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.500
SOUNDS LIKE
A DATE TO ME.

20:35.500 --> 20:37.934
READ MY LIPS--
THERE WAS NO DATE.

20:37.934 --> 20:39.467
WE TALKED ABOUT WHAT
WE WERE GETTING OUR MOMS

20:39.467 --> 20:40.500
FOR MOTHER'S DAY.

20:40.500 --> 20:42.500
AHA. POINT "C,"
SHARED INTERESTS.

20:42.500 --> 20:45.300
16 TO BASE. WE HAVE
A CONFIRMED DATE.

20:45.300 --> 20:47.567
SEND BACKUP.

20:54.200 --> 20:55.500
UH, TOPANGA?

20:55.500 --> 20:57.900
YOU AND I HAVE TO
GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT.

20:57.900 --> 20:59.233
YES, CORY?

20:59.233 --> 21:02.033
FRIDAY NIGHT WHEN
YOU CAME OVER TO MY HOUSE...

21:02.033 --> 21:03.400
THAT WAS NOT A DATE.

21:03.400 --> 21:05.100
I'M NOT INTO LABELS.

21:05.100 --> 21:06.500
YEAH, BUT IF YOU WERE,

21:06.500 --> 21:10.033
WHAT WE HAD FRIDAY NIGHT
WOULD NOT BE LABELED A DATE,

21:10.033 --> 21:11.300
'CAUSE IF
YOU'LL RECALL

21:11.300 --> 21:12.700
THE CIRCUMSTANCES
OF THAT EVENING,

21:12.700 --> 21:15.600
I CANCELED WHAT WOULD HAVE
BEEN LABELED A DATE.

21:15.600 --> 21:18.100
THAT'S FINE, CORY.
IT WAS NOT A DATE.

21:20.300 --> 21:22.033
WELL,
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

21:22.033 --> 21:23.033
OK.

21:24.500 --> 21:26.100
HEY, TOPANGA?

21:26.100 --> 21:27.800
YOU KNOW,
YOUR IDEA ABOUT

21:27.800 --> 21:30.500
WRITING MY MOM A POEM
FOR MOTHER'S DAY

21:30.500 --> 21:31.600
REALLY WORKED OUT GREAT.

21:31.600 --> 21:33.100
SHE CRIED.

21:33.100 --> 21:36.000
TEARS ARE THE THANK YOU
NOTES OF THE SOUL.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.934
YOU KNOW A LOT
ABOUT WOMEN.

21:37.934 --> 21:40.400
WELL, I AM GOING
TO GROW UP TO BE ONE.

22:01.867 --> 22:04.834
FACE IT.
MINKUS WAS RIGHT.

22:04.834 --> 22:08.200
DON'T YOU HATE IT
WHEN THAT HAPPENS?

22:09.300 --> 22:10.700
NO MATTER HOW
YOU LOOK AT IT,

22:10.700 --> 22:11.834
THERE'S GOING
TO BE HORMONES,

22:11.834 --> 22:14.200
AND THERE'S
GOING TO BE GIRLS.

22:14.200 --> 22:17.367
IMPORTANT GIRLS ARE GOING
TO COME INTO OUR LIVES

22:17.367 --> 22:21.233
AND STAY FOR
DAYS AT A TIME.

22:21.233 --> 22:22.400
YOU KNOW WHAT'S COOL?

22:22.400 --> 22:23.900
WE MADE IT THROUGH
OUR FIRST DATES,

22:23.900 --> 22:25.033
AND WE'RE STILL
BEST FRIENDS.

22:25.033 --> 22:26.467
AND WE'RE GOING
TO STAY BEST FRIENDS

22:26.467 --> 22:29.900
THROUGH SECOND DATES,
PROMS, ENGAGEMENTS,

22:29.900 --> 22:31.567
MARRIAGES.

22:31.567 --> 22:34.100
SECOND MARRIAGES.

22:34.100 --> 22:35.500
WHATEVER COMES ALONG,

22:35.500 --> 22:37.767
WE'RE GOING TO STAND HERE
AND FACE IT TOGETHER,

22:37.767 --> 22:38.700
SHOULDER TO SHOULDER.

22:40.834 --> 22:41.867
HI, SHAWN.

22:41.867 --> 22:42.900
HI, CORY.

22:42.900 --> 22:44.500
LATER.
LATER.
