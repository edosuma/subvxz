WEBVTT

15:42.375 --> 15:43.750
Did you notice?

15:45.000 --> 15:46.250
She sampled our fucking DNA.

15:47.583 --> 15:49.875
How else could she be sure
we're who we claim to be?

15:52.958 --> 15:54.958
We could bloody sample hers.

15:55.041 --> 15:57.166
And be renditioned.

15:58.750 --> 16:01.666
I've never met a senior
police officer before.

16:01.750 --> 16:04.416
A rather
extraordinary individual.

16:04.500 --> 16:06.625
They're all like that,
unfortunately.

16:06.708 --> 16:08.041
There are--

16:35.708 --> 16:38.250
If we were smart,
we'd be packing.

16:38.333 --> 16:39.875
We'd be gone.

16:39.958 --> 16:42.000
We leave,
this was all for nothing.

16:42.083 --> 16:43.708
We'd lose access to the stub
and what's inside the girl.

16:43.791 --> 16:46.791
I'm not sure it's worth
dying for, luv.

16:46.875 --> 16:51.083
And I'm not sure I can live with
having run away from it.

16:51.166 --> 16:53.458
How about you?

35:05.916 --> 35:08.458
It's not just the Klepts
we're crossing here.

35:08.541 --> 35:10.583
There's the Met Police now too
and either one of them

35:10.666 --> 35:12.041
would end us...

35:14.375 --> 35:15.958
You realize
what this could mean?

35:16.041 --> 35:18.125
We're the only ones who know.

35:18.208 --> 35:19.333
Aelita knows.

35:20.875 --> 35:22.208
Aelita's dead...

35:22.291 --> 35:24.958
Or gone to ground so thoroughly
she might as well be.

35:25.041 --> 35:27.500
This is ours. For the taking.

35:27.583 --> 35:30.583
How do we access the bacteria?
How do we sequence it?

35:30.666 --> 35:32.750
All we'll need to do is hire
someone in the stub to--

35:34.083 --> 35:35.083
Himself, luv.

35:37.125 --> 35:39.708
Tell me that won't be
part of the pleasure.

35:41.166 --> 35:43.416
Stealing it right out from
under his arrogant fucking...

37:13.208 --> 37:15.208
And yes: arrogant.

37:16.375 --> 37:18.708
So it's all a bit
up in the air...

37:20.125 --> 37:21.541
...I fear.
