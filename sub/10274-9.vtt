WEBVTT

00:01.880 --> 00:04.428
-What is it that you
do there at the church?

00:04.430 --> 00:05.624
-We talk.

00:05.630 --> 00:06.858
-They get them when
they're children.

00:06.860 --> 00:09.886
They indoctrinate them
with friendship and songs.

00:09.890 --> 00:11.733
-I really like the
people that work.

00:11.740 --> 00:14.629
I don't feel right about helping
your office with them any more.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.471
-Not sure it's enough to get
her back on Clark's side,

00:16.480 --> 00:19.699
so this is how I fixed it.

00:19.700 --> 00:21.008
Oh, come on, guys.

00:21.010 --> 00:21.999
Martha's ugly.

00:23.500 --> 00:25.445
-We can expose US
forces secretly

00:25.450 --> 00:27.759
training contra commanders
on American soil.

00:27.760 --> 00:29.694
It looks like
the best way onto the camp

00:29.700 --> 00:30.792
is septic.

00:30.800 --> 00:32.518
Which truck do you drive?

00:32.520 --> 00:33.418
-Number nine.

00:33.420 --> 00:34.296
-Where are the keys?

00:34.300 --> 00:37.280
-Inside the truck.

00:37.290 --> 00:39.235
-We can tie him up and gag him.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.002
-What if he gets loose?

00:40.010 --> 00:40.704
-He won't.

00:40.710 --> 00:41.859
-What if a hiker
comes by and they

00:41.860 --> 00:43.532
call the police why
we are in the camp?

00:43.540 --> 00:44.450
-No one hikes around here.

00:44.460 --> 00:45.154
Phillip.

00:45.160 --> 00:45.854
No.

01:01.920 --> 01:02.614
-Don't worry.

01:13.430 --> 01:14.124
-Shining City.

01:24.550 --> 01:26.188
-All right, Tom.

01:26.190 --> 01:27.509
Step out of the
truck for me, please.

01:27.510 --> 01:28.204
-Sure.

01:33.330 --> 01:34.820
-Open up the back
for me, please.

01:34.830 --> 01:35.524
-Sure.

01:42.910 --> 01:44.878
-Heel, bud.

02:00.160 --> 02:01.115
Jesus.

02:01.120 --> 02:05.636
It smells worse than
the shit it covers up.

02:05.640 --> 02:06.322
-Yeah.

02:09.040 --> 02:09.734
-Have a good night.

02:09.740 --> 02:11.537
-You too.

02:11.540 --> 02:12.234
Good boy.

03:38.840 --> 03:39.829
But we're SEALs.

03:39.840 --> 03:41.819
We're supposed to know
how to use a firearm.

03:41.830 --> 03:43.809
If you had taught
him how to load that thing,

03:43.820 --> 03:45.458
there wouldn't have been
an accidental discharge.

03:45.550 --> 03:46.881
The guy nearly
blew my foot off.

03:46.890 --> 03:48.892
It's like my 12-year-old
sister handling a gun.

03:49.600 --> 03:51.693
No, my sister actually handles
a gun better than these contras.

04:03.130 --> 04:03.892
-Five minutes.

04:10.730 --> 04:13.449
Shooters, you're gonna
get a magazine of five rounds

04:13.450 --> 04:14.678
and a magazine of 20 rounds.

04:19.140 --> 04:21.119
All ready on the firing line.

04:23.100 --> 04:26.558
Shooters, make ready!

04:48.200 --> 04:53.354
Shooters, you may commence
fire when you see your targets.

05:15.570 --> 05:16.923
-What are you doing here?

05:16.930 --> 05:19.535
-Uh, just, uh, checking
for drainage problems .

05:19.540 --> 05:21.121
-Out here?

05:21.130 --> 05:21.824
-Oh, you know what?

05:21.830 --> 05:26.301
It's OK cause, uh,
I'm with septic.

05:26.310 --> 05:27.607
-Hey, hey, he's got a ca--

05:31.300 --> 05:31.994
-Quiet.

05:32.000 --> 05:32.716
Quiet.

05:32.720 --> 05:33.527
Quiet.

05:33.530 --> 05:34.997
Quiet.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.479
Quiet.

05:36.480 --> 05:37.947
Shh.

05:57.950 --> 05:58.871
Somebody out there?

06:24.330 --> 06:25.319
-Go, go, go.

06:31.810 --> 06:32.765
-Gimme your jacket.

06:37.520 --> 06:38.214
-Go, go.

06:38.220 --> 06:41.678
-Come here, come here.

06:41.680 --> 06:42.669
OK.

06:42.680 --> 06:43.374
Go.

09:08.340 --> 09:09.534
You are being read

09:09.540 --> 09:11.246
into the Have Blue program.

09:11.250 --> 09:13.821
This is a top secret US
government project administered

09:13.830 --> 09:14.888
by the Department of Defence.

09:33.200 --> 09:34.531
-You must have some
pretty powerful

09:34.540 --> 09:36.701
friends to get us
here on a Sunday.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.029
-To get us here at all.

09:38.040 --> 09:40.395
We're not supposed to be
talking about this to anyone.

09:40.400 --> 09:41.799
-Not even our wives.

09:41.810 --> 09:43.368
They have people
watching our wives.

09:43.380 --> 09:44.699
You know that?

09:44.710 --> 09:47.053
Making sure we haven't
blabbed to them?

09:47.060 --> 09:49.938
-Well, I'm the guy that's
gonna make sure that you don't.

09:49.940 --> 09:52.408
-Well, what do you know?

09:52.420 --> 09:54.729
-Not enough.

09:54.730 --> 09:59.554
It sounds like science fiction,
but you make planes invisible.

10:03.600 --> 10:06.194
-Project Harvey.

10:06.200 --> 10:07.280
-Which is?

10:07.290 --> 10:07.972
-Stealth.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.059
-We can bring our
planes and submarines

10:13.070 --> 10:15.538
right into Soviet territory
without any detection.

10:19.630 --> 10:25.671
-The KGB kidnapped this
man, Anton Baklanov.

10:25.680 --> 10:28.251
And took him back
to the Soviet Union.

10:28.260 --> 10:29.204
Was he the key to stealth?

10:32.350 --> 10:33.703
-We don't know that man.

10:33.710 --> 10:35.541
Uh, he wasn't the key to it.

10:35.550 --> 10:38.212
-No one person has
the key to anything.

10:38.220 --> 10:40.916
-Information is spread out
through multiple departments

10:40.920 --> 10:42.137
and highly compartmented.

10:42.140 --> 10:44.665
-Classic definition of the
left hand no knowing the right.

10:44.670 --> 10:46.797
-Soviets would have to kidnap
a hell of a lot of people

10:46.800 --> 10:48.085
to put it all together.

10:48.090 --> 10:50.342
-And get through a hell
of a lot of security.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.011
The last meeting where all
of the different groups

10:52.020 --> 10:55.433
actually met, each of us
had two of our security guys

10:55.440 --> 10:57.283
watching our every move.

10:57.290 --> 10:58.609
-What meeting was that?

11:03.240 --> 11:04.366
What meeting was that?

11:10.210 --> 11:14.226
He is probably being
tortured right now.

11:14.230 --> 11:16.619
And once they realise he doesn't
have everything they need,

11:16.630 --> 11:19.019
they will find out who does.

11:19.020 --> 11:20.499
You said that they
would need to kidnap

11:20.510 --> 11:23.217
a hell of a lot of
people to get to stealth?

11:23.220 --> 11:25.063
Well, that's exactly
what they'll do.

11:25.070 --> 11:27.436
They got to him.

11:27.440 --> 11:30.068
Circumvented dozens of
FBI agents looking for him

11:30.070 --> 11:32.038
and sent him out of the country.

11:32.040 --> 11:35.032
You think two DOD security
guards can protect you?

11:35.040 --> 11:38.020
Or anybody else?

11:38.030 --> 11:38.724
Think again.

11:44.260 --> 11:45.909
-Alexandria, Virginia.

11:45.910 --> 11:48.128
Two months ago.

11:48.130 --> 11:49.711
-Who was there?

11:49.720 --> 11:53.167
-Uh, reps from
Lockheed and Northrop.

11:53.170 --> 11:55.730
-They're competing against each
other for the DOD contract.

12:16.600 --> 12:19.728
Are we gonna start coming
to church every Sunday now?

12:19.740 --> 12:21.514
-Today's a special service.

12:21.520 --> 12:24.535
It's teenage Sunday.

12:24.540 --> 12:25.598
-Youth day.

12:25.600 --> 12:27.363
-Youth day.

12:27.370 --> 12:32.046
-So we're not going
every Sunday then.

12:32.050 --> 12:36.316
Oh, Dad, I learned
a neat new trick.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.094
Here, pick a card.

12:38.100 --> 12:38.816
-Not today.

12:43.660 --> 12:46.140
-Paige, here.

12:46.150 --> 12:46.946
Pick a card.

12:46.950 --> 12:48.190
Any card.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.030
OK.

12:49.040 --> 12:51.053
Put it in anywhere.

12:51.060 --> 12:53.403
Well, you can't
do it so that I can't it.

12:53.410 --> 12:54.411
Just a sec.

12:54.420 --> 12:55.239
Here, just

12:55.240 --> 12:56.138
They're upside down.

12:56.140 --> 12:56.902
No, they're not.

12:56.910 --> 12:57.751
I can see it.

12:57.760 --> 12:58.556
You're cheating.

12:58.560 --> 12:59.401
It's not cheating.

12:59.410 --> 13:00.104
It's called magic.

13:00.110 --> 13:00.974
-That's enough, Henry.

13:06.040 --> 13:08.190
-You know what?

13:08.200 --> 13:10.145
We're gonna be late.

13:10.150 --> 13:11.139
-Yeah, let's go.

13:18.040 --> 13:20.679
In John
10:10 Jesus tells us,

13:20.690 --> 13:22.487
"I came so that
everyone would have

13:22.490 --> 13:25.869
life and have it
in its fullest."

13:25.870 --> 13:28.850
So since god planned for us
to have peace and happiness

13:28.860 --> 13:32.899
in this life right now,
why are so many of us

13:32.900 --> 13:35.448
hurting and angry inside?

13:35.450 --> 13:37.259
It's because_we
refuse to believe

13:37.260 --> 13:40.673
in god's unconditional
love for us.

13:40.680 --> 13:44.275
_ God created us in his
Image for one reason only.

13:44.280 --> 13:46.885
So that we could
know him personally.

13:46.890 --> 13:50.144
And have a joy-ﬁlled life.

13:50.150 --> 13:50.844
That's it.

13:50.850 --> 13:52.101
But there's no catch.

13:52.110 --> 13:54.214
There's no hidden agenda.

13:54.220 --> 13:57.986
The lord sacrificed
his only son for us.

13:57.990 --> 14:00.379
Paying penalty for
our sins so that we

14:00.380 --> 14:03.167
might know true contentment.

14:03.170 --> 14:08.710
It sounds too good to
be true, but it isn't.

14:08.720 --> 14:11.439
God's provided the way.

14:11.440 --> 14:14.238
We must make the choice.

14:21.990 --> 14:23.446
-Excuse me.

14:23.450 --> 14:25.759
Paige?

14:25.770 --> 14:28.557
Hi, sweetheart.

14:28.560 --> 14:31.074
Oh, you look so beautiful.

14:31.080 --> 14:32.843
You must be Paige's parents.

14:32.850 --> 14:35.114
Such an honor to meet you.

14:35.120 --> 14:38.055
Your daughter has been
such a blessing to us.

14:38.060 --> 14:41.177
-She's a blessing to us, too.

14:41.180 --> 14:42.306
-Paige says you work in travel.

14:42.310 --> 14:43.607
-Yeah.

14:43.610 --> 14:45.282
-Well, we take a
mission trip every year.

14:45.290 --> 14:46.769
We should talk.

14:46.780 --> 14:47.474
-Yeah.

14:47.480 --> 14:48.174
Yeah, we should.

14:48.180 --> 14:50.819
-We'd love it if Paige could
join us on one of our trips.

14:50.830 --> 14:53.549
And see all the good her
generous donations are doing.

14:56.880 --> 14:58.666
-We'|l definitely
talk about that.

15:00.530 --> 15:01.929
-Martha?

15:01.930 --> 15:03.488
I was just about
to ruin your Sunday

15:03.500 --> 15:04.990
and call you in to help me.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.605
-Well, Agent Gaad
beat you to it.

15:07.610 --> 15:08.679
What do you need?

15:08.680 --> 15:11.456
-There was a meeting
between the DOD and Lockheed

15:11.460 --> 15:14.520
in Alexandria, Virginia
on January 23rd.

15:14.530 --> 15:16.213
There are surveillance
reports on everyone

15:16.220 --> 15:17.187
who was at that meeting.

15:17.190 --> 15:20.876
And anything relevant they
have from that date, I want.

15:20.880 --> 15:22.438
Tell them it's Stan
Beeman and I have

15:22.440 --> 15:25.045
codeword clearance
for the prOJect.

15:25.050 --> 15:28.736
-I'll get right on it after I
finish helping Agent Gaad pack.

15:33.150 --> 15:34.128
Thank you, Martha.

15:38.540 --> 15:41.691
-Hey, what's going on?

15:41.700 --> 15:43.042
-Getting ready to
answer questions

15:43.050 --> 15:43.937
in front of the committee.

15:46.480 --> 15:50.689
They told me to expect a call
next week after I testify.

15:55.130 --> 15:57.382
-I feel responsible, sir.

15:57.390 --> 16:00.780
-You are responsible,
Agent Beeman.

16:00.790 --> 16:05.318
So am I.

16:05.320 --> 16:07.914
-How can they come
here, kill my partner,

16:07.920 --> 16:09.456
whoever they want,
and you wind up--

16:09.460 --> 16:11.269
-Well, it seems that when
you and I kill someone,

16:11.280 --> 16:12.656
we leave evidence.

16:12.660 --> 16:14.116
They don't.

16:14.120 --> 16:16.839
They're better at
it than we are.

16:16.840 --> 16:21.948
-Patterson, kidnapped by the KGB
right here in our capital city.

16:21.950 --> 16:24.362
We_ have his sworn
testimony before he

16:24.370 --> 16:25.689
disappeared into thin air.

16:29.980 --> 16:31.686
$600?

16:31.690 --> 16:33.237
That was all you had.

16:33.240 --> 16:34.434
Who told you to do it?

16:34.440 --> 16:35.225
The pastor?

16:35.230 --> 16:35.924
His wife?

16:35.930 --> 16:36.624
-No one.

16:36.630 --> 16:37.460
-Stop protecting them.

16:37.470 --> 16:38.607
-I'm not protecting anybody.

16:38.610 --> 16:40.430
Why do you think I can't
make my own decisions?

16:40.440 --> 16:41.134
-You know why?

16:41.140 --> 16:42.596
Because it's a stupid decision.

16:42.600 --> 16:44.170
And you're not stupid, Paige.

16:44.180 --> 16:45.841
You were saving that
money to go to Europe.

16:45.850 --> 16:47.260
-Well, it's going
to better use there.

16:47.270 --> 16:48.419
What use?

16:48.420 --> 16:50.103
Do you know what they're
using that money for?

16:50.110 --> 16:52.476
-They're feeding
refugees, building houses.

16:52.480 --> 16:55.699
You guys don't help anyone.

16:55.710 --> 16:58.599
-We help you.

16:58.600 --> 16:59.362
We, we help you.

16:59.370 --> 17:01.406
And we helped you
save that money.

17:01.410 --> 17:04.652
Please, do not roll
your eyes at me.

17:04.660 --> 17:05.775
You can show me some respect.

17:05.780 --> 17:07.873
-Paige, you started lying to us.

17:07.880 --> 17:08.835
-I didn't lie.

17:08.840 --> 17:10.876
-Well, you certainly don't
seem to know the difference.

17:10.880 --> 17:11.574
-Do you?

17:25.650 --> 17:26.344
Dad,

17:26.350 --> 17:27.112
-You lie!

17:27.120 --> 17:27.814
-Stop.

17:27.820 --> 17:29.196
What are you doing?
-You guy behind our backs.

17:29.200 --> 17:29.894
Why?

17:29.900 --> 17:31.572
Because of this book
tells you to do that?

17:31.580 --> 17:32.569
-Phillip.

17:32.580 --> 17:33.274
-Does it?

17:38.070 --> 17:40.459
-You respect Jesus, but not us?

18:13.750 --> 18:15.103
-Emergency signal from Fred.

18:18.280 --> 18:24.173
-What happened last night, you
didn't have a choice, Phillip.

18:24.180 --> 18:25.738
This is war.

18:25.750 --> 18:28.332
You think they would've
done anything less to us?

18:28.340 --> 18:29.034
Reagan--

18:29.040 --> 18:30.871
-I don't need the speech.

18:30.880 --> 18:32.393
I know it's war.

18:32.400 --> 18:33.753
This is easier for you.

18:40.500 --> 18:42.445
-You think it's easy for me?

18:42.450 --> 18:43.303
What I do?

19:22.410 --> 19:24.173
-The FBI called me this morning.

19:24.180 --> 19:25.909
They wanna meet with
me tomorrow afternoon.

19:29.030 --> 19:32.898
-Well, could this be a
routine security check?

19:32.900 --> 19:36.973
-No one goes to DC for a
routine security check.

19:36.980 --> 19:38.356
-Do you know if
anyone has called?

19:38.360 --> 19:41.079
-Everyone who was at the
meeting in Alexandria.

19:41.090 --> 19:44.139
I could postpone the
meeting, find out

19:44.140 --> 19:46.096
what they ask the other
folks before going in there.

19:46.100 --> 19:46.794
-No.

19:46.800 --> 19:48.961
No, that would be suspicious.

19:48.970 --> 19:51.347
-All right.

19:51.350 --> 19:52.817
I'll just go in then.

19:56.140 --> 19:58.756
Look, you don't have
to worry about me.

19:58.760 --> 19:59.795
I'll be fine.

19:59.800 --> 20:07.593
Paul Emmett-- Emmett taught me
how to handle the situation.

20:07.600 --> 20:09.556
-Yeah, he was, he
was one of the best.

20:09.560 --> 20:12.154
-Yes, he was.

20:12.160 --> 20:14.958
-I miss him, too.

20:14.970 --> 20:18.428
But we're working together now.

20:18.440 --> 20:22.274
And you need to trust me.

20:22.280 --> 20:23.929
-You give me orders.

20:23.940 --> 20:25.669
I'll follow them.

20:25.670 --> 20:26.887
But you inherited me.

20:26.890 --> 20:29.632
You didn't see something in me.

20:33.610 --> 20:38.855
-Fred, the Americans are getting
more ruthless by the day.

20:38.860 --> 20:42.557
And those propeller planes
that you got for me,

20:42.560 --> 20:47.486
the plans you and Emmett worked
to steal, they were fake.

20:50.750 --> 20:53.708
-Fake?

20:53.710 --> 20:57.726
-160 Soviets seamen died.

20:58.430 --> 20:59.806
-Oh god.

20:59.810 --> 21:01.732
-They planted fake plans
all over the country

21:01.740 --> 21:05.289
and then just waited
for us to take one.

21:05.300 --> 21:08.975
I keep thinking about
all the planning it took.

21:08.980 --> 21:13.644
And I wondered did they even
care how many people die.

21:13.650 --> 21:15.277
-This administration,
the stuff they

21:15.280 --> 21:16.656
get away with, it makes me sick.

21:16.660 --> 21:17.342
-Yeah.

21:21.440 --> 21:25.410
Think about what they did when
you go into that room tomorrow,

21:25.420 --> 21:28.730
or whenever you feel the
least bit intimidated.

21:28.740 --> 21:33.768
Just think about all
those kids that died.

22:18.990 --> 22:19.684
Paige?

22:22.280 --> 22:23.008
-Go away.

22:27.190 --> 22:28.839
Turn it off.

22:28.840 --> 22:31.411
Get up.

22:31.420 --> 22:32.933
-Why?

22:32.940 --> 22:34.100
Because I said so.

22:45.550 --> 22:48.451
Clean the refrigerator.

22:48.460 --> 22:51.167
-What?

22:51.170 --> 22:53.013
You woke me up to
clean the refrigerator?

22:53.020 --> 22:53.918
-Yes.

22:53.920 --> 22:55.706
And after that, mop
the floors and fold

22:55.710 --> 22:57.246
the towels in the basement.

22:57.250 --> 22:58.444
-I have school tomorrow.

22:58.450 --> 22:59.826
Why are you doing this?

22:59.830 --> 23:00.945
-You want to be a grown up?

23:00.950 --> 23:03.271
You want to spend
money the way you want?

23:03.280 --> 23:04.486
Being a grownup
means doing things

23:04.490 --> 23:07.448
you don't want to
do all the time.

23:07.450 --> 23:09.475
It means working when
you are exhausted

23:09.480 --> 23:12.984
and almost never getting what
you want when you want it.

23:12.990 --> 23:15.424
Your father and I
never had a childhood.

23:15.430 --> 23:17.785
Nothing came easy for us ever.

23:21.910 --> 23:24.549
You are so luclq, Paige.

23:28.230 --> 23:29.822
Mop and bucket are
in the basement.

23:46.580 --> 23:49.799
-You know who I am?

23:49.800 --> 23:51.563
-I do.

23:51.570 --> 23:52.798
-Then we can forgo
the pleasantries.

23:56.930 --> 23:59.797
This war has gotten
very personal for me.

23:59.800 --> 24:01.677
And I need you to
listen carefully

24:01.680 --> 24:02.920
because it affects you, too.

24:06.750 --> 24:09.230
-I'm listening.

24:09.240 --> 24:13.415
-I'm in a lot of trouble because
your Sowet foreign minister

24:13.420 --> 24:15.820
won't accept that
Vlad Cosegan was

24:15.830 --> 24:19.379
the tragic victim of
a mugging gone wrong.

24:19.380 --> 24:24.147
I could lose my job, or even
go to jail because of it.

24:24.150 --> 24:26.869
If either of those
things happens,

24:26.870 --> 24:28.770
I'll make sure you
go down with me.

24:28.780 --> 24:30.179
Uh, nothing, thank you.

24:33.890 --> 24:36.802
Before he disappeared
Richard Patterson

24:36.810 --> 24:40.291
gave a very detailed
testimony about his kidnapping

24:40.300 --> 24:44.111
and torture by two KGB illegals.

24:44.120 --> 24:46.816
The second my punishment
is handed down I'll

24:46.820 --> 24:50.176
release his classified
testimony to the press.

24:50.180 --> 24:53.434
Now think of what
that will mean for you

24:53.440 --> 24:55.408
and your people at
the Rezidentura,

24:55.410 --> 24:57.310
all those deportations.

24:57.320 --> 24:59.538
Moscow will not be
pleased when they

24:59.550 --> 25:03.225
have to rebuild their US
operation from scratch.

25:03.230 --> 25:07.337
As we like to say in
America, heads will roll.

25:07.340 --> 25:11.401
You head being at
the top of the list.

25:11.410 --> 25:16.404
So you see my problem
is now your problem.

25:25.690 --> 25:27.419
-I heard so much
about you, Mr. Gaad.

25:30.060 --> 25:32.039
I hope that one
day we would have

25:32.040 --> 25:37.444
the chance to meet face to face.

25:37.450 --> 25:40.863
I just wish it was under
less trying circumstances.

25:46.300 --> 25:47.688
Good day.

26:22.980 --> 26:23.674
-Are you OK?

26:30.950 --> 26:31.632
-Yeah.

26:45.040 --> 26:48.624
-You are here because
the KGB is targeting you,

26:48.630 --> 26:51.713
your family, everyone and
anyone you care about.

26:51.720 --> 26:55.178
-They won't get
anything from me.

26:55.180 --> 27:01.380
-They are masters at
exploiting weakness.

27:01.390 --> 27:04.496
We all have weaknesses.

27:04.500 --> 27:06.912
We all do.

27:06.920 --> 27:08.319
And they will find yours.

27:08.320 --> 27:10.743
-What do you need me to do?

27:10.750 --> 27:12.968
-We're gonna go
through your file.

27:12.970 --> 27:14.824
And go over all the
parts of your life

27:14.830 --> 27:17.537
that make you the most
vulnerable to them,

27:17.540 --> 27:20.805
financially,
emotionally, sexually.

27:20.810 --> 27:21.526
-No, no, no.

27:21.530 --> 27:23.873
I'm, I'm not at all
comfortable with this.

27:23.880 --> 27:25.768
-Well, it's not my
first choice either,

27:25.780 --> 27:30.023
but I'm going to need you
to tell me things, secrets

27:30.030 --> 27:33.102
that you might not have told
anyone else because that is

27:33.110 --> 27:36.375
where their power
lies, in secrets.

27:39.330 --> 27:42.447
If they can keep you
afraid and ashamed,

27:42.450 --> 27:45.237
then they can keep you silent.

27:45.240 --> 27:48.960
And if they can keep you
silent they can control you.

27:51.700 --> 27:54.271
Have you ever been
engaged to be married?

27:54.280 --> 27:54.974
-No.

27:54.980 --> 27:58.131
-And how many close friends
would you say you have?

27:58.140 --> 28:00.005
-Few, not many.

28:00.010 --> 28:03.150
-Could you be more specific?

28:03.160 --> 28:04.593
-Two, I think.

28:04.600 --> 28:09.139
Um, you never really know
enough about people though.

28:09.150 --> 28:11.015
So are you, you gonna
say that because I'm

28:11.020 --> 28:12.419
a loner I'm more vulnerable?

28:15.060 --> 28:17.494
-Look, I'm not sure how
they will approach you,

28:17.500 --> 28:20.913
but I am sure that they will.

28:20.920 --> 28:23.309
-All right.

28:23.310 --> 28:26.689
But let me assure
you, Agent Beeman,

28:26.700 --> 28:28.088
I would never betray my country.

28:33.480 --> 28:35.107
-No one ever imagines they will.

28:45.270 --> 28:47.340
-Riggs and Dubrow,
what happened?

28:47.350 --> 28:49.875
-Official story, truck
flipped in training,

28:49.880 --> 28:51.893
but nobody can know
about that base.

28:51.900 --> 28:54.186
So who knows what
really happened?

28:54.190 --> 28:55.817
Maybe some contra went nuts.

29:06.790 --> 29:09.839
Today was a shitty
day with my shitty kids

29:09.840 --> 29:12.149
and my shitty husband.

29:12.150 --> 29:14.368
I love them, I do, but
damn they get on my nerves.

29:17.870 --> 29:23.854
I wanted to, everyone
knows I want to do.

29:23.860 --> 29:25.999
What I want to do every
second of every day.

29:26.010 --> 29:30.435
I don't even have to say it, but
then I remember the last drink

29:30.440 --> 29:34.513
that got me here two
years, one month,

29:34.520 --> 29:38.320
10 days ago and I didn't.

29:38.330 --> 29:45.691
And I'm just grateful, I guess.

29:45.700 --> 29:48.589
To have this place.

29:48.590 --> 29:50.148
And that's all.

30:04.610 --> 30:07.659
-Um, the surveillance
reports that you requested?

30:07.660 --> 30:11.517
Alexandria, Virginia,
the week of January 23rd.

30:11.520 --> 30:14.182
There's a list of every
person at the meeting

30:14.190 --> 30:17.102
and the names of all of
their security personnel.

30:17.110 --> 30:18.202
-Thank you, Martha.

30:18.210 --> 30:20.770
-I included the local police
reports from that area

30:20.780 --> 30:23.578
as well, as the DOD
meeting was on the same day

30:23.580 --> 30:25.468
as that horrible murder.

30:25.470 --> 30:26.835
There was a tonne of
extra police around,

30:26.840 --> 30:30.731
so maybe someone saw
something useful to you.

30:30.740 --> 30:34.358
-You mean that couple and
their, and their daughter?

30:34.360 --> 30:36.715
-That scared the hell out of me.

30:36.720 --> 30:38.278
I thought it was a
Charles Manson thing,

30:38.280 --> 30:40.692
but I think they ruled that out.

30:40.700 --> 30:42.190
-You know what?

30:42.200 --> 30:44.088
Get me all the files
and physical evidence

30:44.100 --> 30:46.318
connected to those murders also.

30:46.320 --> 30:47.651
-Sure thing.

30:47.660 --> 30:50.185
You think they're related?

30:50.190 --> 30:52.488
-I think I can't
rule anything out.

31:01.380 --> 31:05.180
-I thought we were through
the hard times, you know?

31:05.190 --> 31:09.001
-I'd been sick for
about three months, uh,

31:09.010 --> 31:10.557
and he was just so amazing.

31:10.560 --> 31:13.779
He took such great care of
me and the kids, and, this

31:13.790 --> 31:15.576
is gonna sound weird, but

31:15.580 --> 31:17.935
-Please, my life, no judgement.

31:21.090 --> 31:24.969
-It's not that I wanted him to
be sick or anything like that,

31:24.980 --> 31:32.182
but I, I wanted the
opportunity to show him

31:32.190 --> 31:35.125
that I could be there
for him, you know?

31:35.130 --> 31:36.074
I haven't always been.

31:41.470 --> 31:43.256
I've been going on and on.

31:43.260 --> 31:44.409
-You haven't.

31:44.420 --> 31:47.571
This is what recovery
is all about, you know?

31:47.580 --> 31:51.255
Opening up, being honest.

31:51.260 --> 31:51.954
-OK.

31:51.960 --> 31:53.075
So tell me about you.

31:56.090 --> 31:58.763
-A recovering drunk.

31:58.770 --> 32:01.989
Wife, sister, mother, two kids.

32:01.990 --> 32:04.038
Boy, 10, girl, eight.

32:04.040 --> 32:05.746
Uh, I don't know.

32:05.750 --> 32:08.571
Life gets pretty boring
when you stop drinking.

32:08.580 --> 32:11.708
-What kind of work do you do?

32:11.710 --> 32:12.688
-Assembly line.

32:12.690 --> 32:13.918
Bonng.

32:13.930 --> 32:15.067
-Come on, I told you.

32:15.770 --> 32:16.964
Went on and on and on.

32:16.970 --> 32:17.675
-Yeah, OK.

32:17.680 --> 32:18.374
OK.

32:18.380 --> 32:22.749
Uh, it is boring, but
it's super high security

32:22.750 --> 32:25.878
because you mostly
do government work.

32:25.890 --> 32:29.576
It's a company called Northrop.

33:23.660 --> 33:24.570
-Hi.

33:24.580 --> 33:27.026
-Hey, handsome.

33:27.030 --> 33:28.986
What are you doing here?

33:28.990 --> 33:32.812
-Just, um, I just
wanted to see you.

33:32.820 --> 33:34.128
I didn't wanna go home.

33:34.130 --> 33:34.949
-Clark.

33:34.950 --> 33:35.393
-Uh, yeah.

33:35.400 --> 33:36.082
I know.

33:36.090 --> 33:40.675
I know this--
this is my home.

33:40.680 --> 33:41.374
It is.

33:45.420 --> 33:47.297
-Rough day?

33:47.300 --> 33:49.382
-Yeah.

33:49.390 --> 33:50.778
Were, we you saving this?

33:50.780 --> 33:51.474
-No,no.

33:51.480 --> 33:52.959
It's fine.

33:52.970 --> 33:56.485
But you don't
usually drink, Clark.

33:56.490 --> 33:57.184
What's wrong?

34:00.030 --> 34:03.261
-Martha, you know how much
I love you, don't you?

34:03.270 --> 34:06.182
-Of course.

34:06.190 --> 34:09.170
-But with this
job I can't always

34:09.180 --> 34:12.365
be as honest as I would like.

34:12.370 --> 34:13.416
-Well, I know that.

34:17.130 --> 34:22.352
-The things you don't
know, you don't know.

34:22.360 --> 34:25.067
So stop saying that you know.

34:25.070 --> 34:25.764
-OK.

34:38.370 --> 34:40.474
It's OK that you
have moods, Clark.

34:44.130 --> 34:45.927
I'm not afraid of the
different sides of you.

34:50.800 --> 34:51.789
I love all of you.

34:58.760 --> 35:03.311
-The world is an
ugly place, Martha.

35:03.320 --> 35:08.223
And it is full of prudish,
cruel, nasty people.

35:34.960 --> 35:38.066
I heard something on the
recording from Gaad's office.

35:40.700 --> 35:41.621
-Is he in more trouble?

35:45.210 --> 35:47.986
He's probably gonna
lose his pension.

35:47.990 --> 35:49.059
Maybe even go to gaol.

35:49.060 --> 35:50.277
-You shouldn't
feel sorry for him.

35:50.280 --> 35:50.974
-Well, how can I not?

35:50.980 --> 35:51.662
-Martha.

35:51.670 --> 35:52.625
-This is tearing him apart.

35:52.630 --> 35:53.312
-Martha.

35:56.430 --> 35:58.819
Gaad is not your friend.

35:58.820 --> 36:00.629
Oh, come on, guys.

36:00.630 --> 36:01.449
Martha's ugly.

36:02.860 --> 36:05.567
I'd have to be 10 scotches
deep before I touch her.

36:05.570 --> 36:06.377
Ew.

36:06.380 --> 36:07.824
10 scotches and a
bag over her head.

36:11.870 --> 36:13.041
-Bastards.

36:13.050 --> 36:15.302
-I know.

36:15.310 --> 36:16.004
I know.

36:37.250 --> 36:39.343
-Do they always talk
about me that way?

36:43.910 --> 36:45.013
oh my god

36:45.020 --> 36:47.966
-I shouldn't have played it.

36:49.050 --> 36:49.744
-No.

36:49.750 --> 36:53.516
It's, it's better that I
know who they really are.

36:56.940 --> 37:04.199
-Martha, I, I've never been any
good at seduction or romance.

37:04.210 --> 37:05.984
But I love the way you look.

37:05.990 --> 37:08.265
I love every part of you.

37:08.270 --> 37:13.549
And if, if I could I would
go in there and I would

37:15.410 --> 37:19.346
-I know you would, Clark.

37:19.350 --> 37:23.059
-But I have a job.

37:23.060 --> 37:27.144
-A very important job.

37:27.150 --> 37:28.902
-And things are a lot
worse than you know.

37:31.850 --> 37:32.544
-What?

37:36.480 --> 37:42.305
-Uh, have you ever
heard of stealth?

37:42.310 --> 37:43.686
-No.

37:43.690 --> 37:47.126
-It's a huge complex
military project.

37:47.130 --> 37:48.779
I don't understand
it all, but there

37:48.780 --> 37:53.535
are a lot of leaks coming
out, we think, of your office.

37:53.540 --> 37:55.121
We found it very difficult
to find a source.

38:02.150 --> 38:02.844
-What do you need?

38:07.130 --> 38:09.030
-I so appreciate
that, I really do.

38:09.040 --> 38:09.836
-Let me help you, Clark.

38:09.840 --> 38:10.602
-No.
It's dangerous.

38:10.610 --> 38:11.577
-I'm not afraid.

38:16.380 --> 38:19.349
Oh, I love you.

38:19.350 --> 38:22.501
You know you're
everything to me.

38:22.510 --> 38:23.204
-And you to me.

38:27.480 --> 38:28.174
You.

38:57.010 --> 38:58.887
-What?

38:58.890 --> 39:01.825
You want me to use my mouth?

39:01.830 --> 39:02.603
-No.

39:02.610 --> 39:03.304
-What?

39:03.310 --> 39:04.242
What's wrong?

39:04.250 --> 39:08.949
-I've, I'm, I'm just too upset.

39:08.960 --> 39:10.439
And I've had too much to drink.

39:14.400 --> 39:15.469
I have to go.

39:15.480 --> 39:16.174
-What?

39:16.180 --> 39:19.581
Clark, you don't have to leave.

39:19.590 --> 39:21.729
-Yes, I do.

39:29.080 --> 39:30.206
RUTH WESTHEIMER
If you

39:30.210 --> 39:34.192
do engage in a lot of
foreplay so that you are going

39:34.200 --> 39:38.534
to be very moist
inside the vagina.

39:38.540 --> 39:42.658
And if you are putting
your behind on a pillow

39:42.660 --> 39:46.767
so that penetration is going
to be a little bit easier.

39:46.770 --> 39:49.159
The more relaxed
you are, the less

39:49.170 --> 39:50.865
it's going to be a problem.

39:50.870 --> 39:55.364
What you also can do is actually
help him insert the penis

39:55.370 --> 39:57.429
into the vagina
because this way you

39:57.430 --> 40:00.991
have some control
over how fast--

40:01.000 --> 40:02.285
-Mind if I turn it off?

40:02.290 --> 40:04.099
You would like the--

40:04.100 --> 40:04.998
-No, go ahead.

40:05.010 --> 40:06.602
And I tell you what,

40:06.610 --> 40:08.384
if the two of you
love each other

40:08.390 --> 40:09.493
-You going somewhere?

40:09.500 --> 40:11.388
Uh, my mom's.

40:11.390 --> 40:13.563
-Oh.

40:13.570 --> 40:14.298
-Did you mention that?

40:14.300 --> 40:15.847
I, I don't remember.

40:15.850 --> 40:17.954
-She's not feeling that well.

40:17.960 --> 40:18.654
-Oh no.

40:18.660 --> 40:19.513
I'm sorry.

40:19.520 --> 40:20.544
-No, it's nothing serious.

40:20.550 --> 40:21.756
I just haven't
seen her in awhile.

40:21.760 --> 40:30.589
So I thought the,
my mom is not sick.

40:33.510 --> 40:35.774
She's not sick.

40:35.780 --> 40:37.725
-OK.

40:37.730 --> 40:40.278
Where you going?

40:40.280 --> 40:42.236
-Away.

40:42.240 --> 40:47.405
With a man I met from EST.

40:47.410 --> 40:49.492
-What do you mean away?

40:49.500 --> 40:50.194
-Away.

40:50.200 --> 40:50.894
I don't know.

40:50.900 --> 40:51.707
For a few days.

40:51.710 --> 40:56.329
We've, um, had this emotional
connection for some time.

40:56.340 --> 40:59.082
And we just want to see if
there's something else there.

41:01.970 --> 41:05.883
-You're telling me you're
going to have an affair?

41:05.890 --> 41:06.584
Sandra?

41:06.590 --> 41:08.831
-I might.

41:08.840 --> 41:09.534
I don't know.

41:09.540 --> 41:11.178
At least I'm being honest.

41:11.180 --> 41:11.874
Go ahead.

41:11.880 --> 41:14.405
Tell me that you're
not having an affair.

41:14.410 --> 41:21.691
-I'm,

41:21.700 --> 41:24.680
-You know what kills me
about the whole thing?

41:24.690 --> 41:28.103
Is that you didn't have any
idea anything was going on.

41:28.110 --> 41:30.089
You, Mr.
Counter-intelligence genius.

41:30.090 --> 41:31.546
You just didn't see it?

41:35.340 --> 41:37.968
So you either didn't
wanna know or you

41:37.970 --> 41:40.450
didn't care enough
to pay attention.

41:43.760 --> 41:45.648
-Who is he?

41:45.650 --> 41:46.548
-Oh, it doesn't matter.

41:46.550 --> 41:47.551
-Who is he, Sandra?

41:47.560 --> 41:48.356
It doesn't
matter who he is.

41:48.360 --> 41:49.600
What are you gonna do?
Go arrest him?

41:59.670 --> 42:00.364
-Sandra?

42:03.090 --> 42:03.784
Sandra?

42:07.700 --> 42:08.769
Are you leaving me?

42:12.440 --> 42:15.910
-That would be easy
for you, wouldn't it?

42:15.920 --> 42:18.377
You get to be the good guy
and your kooky wife leaves you

42:18.380 --> 42:21.838
for some guy she met at EST. No.

42:21.850 --> 42:23.989
I'm not gonna leave
you, Stan, but I'm not

42:24.000 --> 42:26.844
gonna sit around
and wait for you

42:26.850 --> 42:29.068
to get the courage to leave me.

44:21.300 --> 44:23.700
-Mr. Jennings.

44:23.710 --> 44:25.359
Can I help you?

44:25.370 --> 44:28.100
-As a matter of fact,
Tim, yes, you can.

44:30.920 --> 44:32.035
-Have a seat, please.

44:32.040 --> 44:32.870
-I won't be staying long.

44:35.810 --> 44:38.813
-What is it you want?

44:38.820 --> 44:40.219
-I want you to stay
away from my daughter.

44:43.090 --> 44:45.320
-You want her to stop
coming to church?

44:45.330 --> 44:46.024
-That's right.

44:48.930 --> 44:52.605
-That's between you and Paige.

44:52.610 --> 44:55.147
-Why, I think you
can help with that.

44:55.150 --> 44:58.950
And I think you
will help with that.

44:58.960 --> 45:02.646
-I can't turn Paige away from
the church, Mr. Jennings.

45:02.650 --> 45:05.551
It's a sanctuary.

45:05.560 --> 45:06.743
I can't turn anyone away.

45:06.750 --> 45:08.650
That's the whole
point of this place.

45:12.300 --> 45:13.005
Is something wrong?

45:19.100 --> 45:23.582
-You took $600 from her.

45:26.290 --> 45:29.544
-I thought you knew about that.

45:29.550 --> 45:33.520
We never would've accepted it if
we thought you didn't approve.

45:33.530 --> 45:36.647
I'll write you a check
right now if you want,

45:36.650 --> 45:42.668
but that's not why you're here.

45:42.680 --> 45:43.385
-No, it's not.

45:46.480 --> 45:51.099
-Are you really gonna
beat me up, Mr. Jennings?

45:51.110 --> 45:53.613
For $600?

45:53.620 --> 45:54.314
For your daughter?

45:54.320 --> 45:57.198
-I would do anything
for my daughter.

45:57.200 --> 46:01.853
I would do anything
for my daughter.

46:01.860 --> 46:03.259
-The best thing
you can do for her

46:03.270 --> 46:05.318
is find a way to
deal with your anger.

46:08.320 --> 46:11.505
-I'm not here to be saved.

46:11.510 --> 46:12.204
Not by, you.

46:12.210 --> 46:14.337
Tim, or your god.

46:19.900 --> 46:23.085
-I see that you're in
pain, Mr. Jennings.

46:26.270 --> 46:30.707
There is grace and
forgiveness for you.

46:30.710 --> 46:31.404
For everyone.

46:37.900 --> 46:38.969
-Do you believe that?

46:44.030 --> 46:44.724
-I do.
