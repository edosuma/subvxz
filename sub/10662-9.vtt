WEBVTT

00:00.427 --> 00:03.828
The Carmichael Show is taped in
front of a live studio audience.

00:03.830 --> 00:05.097
(loudly): Joe, time for dinner.

00:05.098 --> 00:07.065
I'm not calling you again.

00:08.267 --> 00:09.601
What's Dad doing in there?

00:09.602 --> 00:12.704
Oh, he got himself one of
those Facebook Web sites.

00:12.705 --> 00:17.209
He made me take 25
profile pictures of him,

00:18.277 --> 00:21.346
before I "captured his essence."

00:21.347 --> 00:23.281
Well, I think it's great he's becoming

00:23.282 --> 00:24.716
more connected with the world.

00:24.717 --> 00:26.671
He might finally see other
opinions than his own,

00:26.672 --> 00:28.255
and it might make him less opinionated.

00:28.256 --> 00:29.755
Maxine, I don't think Facebook

00:29.756 --> 00:31.089
or the Internet has ever made

00:31.090 --> 00:33.358
a single person less opinionated.

00:33.359 --> 00:34.526
You know?

00:34.527 --> 00:36.461
And I formed that opinion
after the Internet,

00:36.462 --> 00:38.063
- so I know it holds up.
- (laughs)

00:38.064 --> 00:39.924
- (laughs)
- All right. I'm gonna go get him.

00:41.834 --> 00:43.468
Yo, Dad. What's up?

00:43.469 --> 00:45.771
I'm drunk on power, Jerrod.

00:45.772 --> 00:47.315
Now, look, you got to understand this.

00:47.316 --> 00:49.341
I always had these thoughts in my head,

00:49.342 --> 00:50.805
but I've been looking for an outlet,

00:50.806 --> 00:51.910
and I finally found one.

00:51.911 --> 00:55.480
Joe Carmichael is
killing it on Facebook.

00:55.481 --> 00:57.082
All right, all right, Dad.

00:57.083 --> 00:58.050
Slow down for a second.

00:58.051 --> 00:59.284
How many friends you got?

00:59.285 --> 01:01.086
Brace yourself. 52!

01:03.656 --> 01:06.425
Am I bracing myself
for a larger number?

01:06.426 --> 01:07.929
Well, Jerrod, I've never been friends

01:07.930 --> 01:11.797
with 52 people, all together,
during my entire lifetime.

01:11.798 --> 01:14.699
Shoot, now I got 52 people
listening to my every word.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.483
Okay, Dad, you've been
alive for a long time.

01:16.484 --> 01:17.636
You should get out more.

01:17.637 --> 01:20.072
That's like a friend a year.

01:20.073 --> 01:22.441
Joe Carmichael is
killing it on Facebook.

01:22.442 --> 01:23.808
My man!

01:25.015 --> 01:26.518
Look, I was getting a haircut, right?

01:26.519 --> 01:28.142
And I started reading
your status updates

01:28.143 --> 01:29.414
out loud at the barbershop.

01:29.415 --> 01:31.249
Man, you are really inspiring people.

01:31.250 --> 01:32.851
(laughs) Daddy, stand on up.

01:32.852 --> 01:34.886
Take a bow, man. You earned it.

01:34.887 --> 01:36.721
Oh, man, I ain't getting
up off this couch.

01:36.722 --> 01:38.690
But I appreciate the gesture.

01:38.691 --> 01:40.804
Look, Bobby, instead of
reading Dad's Facebook posts,

01:40.805 --> 01:43.007
you should read my tweets
out loud at the barbershop.

01:43.008 --> 01:44.529
Come on, man, nah, Jerrod.

01:44.530 --> 01:46.998
Like, (scoffs) Dad got
good social commentary.

01:46.999 --> 01:48.433
Your tweets always sound negative.

01:48.434 --> 01:50.168
(laughing) What are you talking about?

01:50.169 --> 01:52.204
I have amazing social
commentary, Bobby.

01:52.205 --> 01:54.206
Dude, there's a difference
between you and Dad.

01:54.207 --> 01:56.208
Matter of fact, hold on,
let me pull this up.

01:56.209 --> 01:57.552
This is Dad. Posted this earlier:

01:57.553 --> 01:58.743
"Strippers don't like it

01:58.744 --> 02:00.527
"when you get change
for a 20 off the stage."

02:00.528 --> 02:02.447
Come on, man.

02:02.448 --> 02:03.748
It's genius.

02:03.749 --> 02:06.251
You know what I mean? And look, I Li...

02:06.252 --> 02:08.595
I like the fact that Facebook
got these new emojis on here.

02:08.596 --> 02:10.062
I gave that status a...

02:12.725 --> 02:14.459
JOE: You learn the hard way.

02:14.460 --> 02:16.161
That is not great social commentary.

02:16.162 --> 02:18.296
That's just a simple
fact about strip clubs.

02:18.297 --> 02:19.631
Come on. Dinner's ready.

02:19.632 --> 02:21.333
But look here, man,
I didn't know that, okay?

02:21.334 --> 02:22.534
I learned something. And look,

02:22.535 --> 02:24.002
it's three other people
in that barbershop

02:24.003 --> 02:25.386
that learned something, too, okay?

02:25.387 --> 02:27.530
- (grumbles)
- Try... look, here's one of your tweets.

02:27.531 --> 02:28.773
"Democracy is an illusion."

02:28.774 --> 02:30.274
What am I supposed to do with that?

02:31.511 --> 02:33.678
Democracy <i>is</i> an illusion, Bobby.

02:33.679 --> 02:35.514
The only way to bring
about change is through

02:35.515 --> 02:37.018
MAXINE and JERROD: ...money or death.

02:37.019 --> 02:39.354
If you know it, retweet it, Maxine.

02:40.520 --> 02:41.953
I don't want to retweet that.

02:41.954 --> 02:43.455
It's embarrassing.

02:43.456 --> 02:45.324
You know I've actually lost friends

02:45.325 --> 02:47.469
because of Jerrod's tweets.
Like that time you tweeted

02:47.470 --> 02:49.728
that your biggest fear
used to be spiders,

02:49.729 --> 02:52.130
but it is now the cough
of an immigrant.

02:53.432 --> 02:57.369
That tweet was written at a time
when Ebola was scaring us all.

02:58.538 --> 02:59.804
See, look... nah, nah.

02:59.805 --> 03:01.106
Dad can top that.

03:01.107 --> 03:02.841
Matter of fact, he
tweeted this yesterday.

03:02.842 --> 03:04.709
"How come every Asian person under 30

03:04.710 --> 03:06.173
looks like they're from the future?"

03:06.174 --> 03:06.945
(laughing)

03:06.946 --> 03:09.581
Nothing this family says
should be made public.

03:11.217 --> 03:12.584
You shouldn't say bad things

03:12.585 --> 03:14.853
about the Asians on the Internet, Joe.

03:14.854 --> 03:16.488
They invented computers.

03:18.317 --> 03:19.780
I'm exercising my freedom of speech.

03:19.781 --> 03:20.725
That's right.

03:20.726 --> 03:21.860
That's right. All right?

03:21.861 --> 03:23.004
It-it's in the Constitution.

03:23.005 --> 03:24.296
It's all we got to go by.

03:24.297 --> 03:26.720
Mm-hmm. I mean, you know, even
though democracy's an illusion

03:26.721 --> 03:28.922
and your vote doesn't matter,
it still counts to us.

03:29.869 --> 03:30.869
Oh!

03:30.870 --> 03:31.870
(laughs)

03:31.871 --> 03:34.739
Another friend request. (laughs)

03:34.740 --> 03:36.408
Vicki Colette. Count it.

03:36.409 --> 03:38.410
Vicki Colette!?

03:38.411 --> 03:40.178
Wait. Who... who's Vicki Colette?

03:40.179 --> 03:44.582
Oh, you don't know about
Vicki "Muffin Top" Colette?

03:46.085 --> 03:49.254
That's my old high school
girlfriend before your mama.

03:49.255 --> 03:51.056
Uh, she just poked me.
What do I do now?

03:51.057 --> 03:53.258
Am I supposed to poke her back?

03:53.259 --> 03:56.127
Joe, look at me.

03:56.128 --> 03:57.996
No.

03:59.865 --> 04:01.966
â™ª

04:08.695 --> 04:15.307
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<b>awaqeded</b> for <b>www.addic7ed.com</b>.

04:15.308 --> 04:17.781
Joe, I don't think it's appropriate

04:17.783 --> 04:20.402
to be Facebook friends
with an ex-girlfriend.

04:20.403 --> 04:22.004
Well, I already accepted.

04:22.005 --> 04:23.872
Well, let me see this Vicki Colette.

04:23.873 --> 04:24.840
All right.

04:24.841 --> 04:25.824
- Uh-huh.
- There you go.

04:25.825 --> 04:28.644
Ah, she looks good for her age.

04:28.645 --> 04:30.679
Wh-Why "for her age," Jerrod?

04:30.680 --> 04:31.863
Why can't she just look good?

04:31.864 --> 04:33.905
Because after 40, your good looks

04:33.906 --> 04:36.285
come with a disclaimer,
Maxine, all right?

04:36.286 --> 04:38.069
All right? I-I'm not
saying it's a bad thing,

04:38.070 --> 04:40.956
but we can't pretend it's not a thing.

04:40.957 --> 04:42.624
Let me look at her.

04:43.860 --> 04:46.828
She does not look good for her age.

04:48.031 --> 04:52.201
She looks really bad for her age.

04:52.202 --> 04:55.571
Really, really, really bad for her age.

04:55.572 --> 04:57.039
All right, all right, look, Ma,

04:57.040 --> 04:58.463
there's no need to feel threatened.

04:58.464 --> 05:00.876
No one's actually looking
to reconnect on Facebook.

05:00.877 --> 05:02.351
Facebook's just a place where you go

05:02.352 --> 05:03.695
to see if you're winning at life.

05:03.696 --> 05:04.746
Well, how do you win?

05:04.747 --> 05:06.014
By staying more attractive

05:06.015 --> 05:07.958
than all your friends from
high school, you know?

05:07.959 --> 05:10.652
They should rename Facebook
GuessWho'sFatNow.com.

05:10.653 --> 05:12.788
(laughing)

05:12.789 --> 05:15.524
Cheryl Finley.

05:15.525 --> 05:17.292
I'm sorry, but she was very mean.

05:17.293 --> 05:20.028
She called me Triscuit.

05:20.029 --> 05:21.063
What does that mean?

05:21.064 --> 05:22.798
Brown cracker.

05:22.799 --> 05:26.535
(laughing)

05:26.536 --> 05:29.404
I'm sorry, but that
was a good one... no!

05:29.405 --> 05:30.806
(laughing)

05:37.080 --> 05:38.247
Look, look,

05:38.248 --> 05:40.315
social media is more than that, okay?

05:40.316 --> 05:42.150
Like, if I'm feeling sad,

05:42.151 --> 05:46.455
I'll post something real vague,
like... (sighs)

05:47.624 --> 05:49.958
If Bobby Carmichael
wasn't here anymore,

05:49.959 --> 05:52.761
would you care?

05:52.762 --> 05:54.830
And then get a bunch of "likes."

05:56.199 --> 05:58.066
Why would they like that?

05:58.067 --> 05:59.935
No, see, Mama,
"like" doesn't mean "like,"

05:59.936 --> 06:01.479
on social media, you know what I mean?

06:01.480 --> 06:03.481
"Like" means like, uh... "I see you."

06:04.173 --> 06:05.374
"I care."

06:05.375 --> 06:06.742
And, uh, that type of support

06:06.743 --> 06:08.844
can just turn your whole day around.

06:08.845 --> 06:10.345
(phone dings)

06:10.346 --> 06:11.580
Oh!

06:11.581 --> 06:15.550
(laughs) Vicki Colette
just liked my profile pic.

06:15.551 --> 06:17.386
What kind of lonely,

06:17.387 --> 06:19.288
desperate woman goes around

06:19.289 --> 06:22.457
just liking Facebook pictures?

06:26.095 --> 06:27.929
I mean this, Joe,

06:27.930 --> 06:29.698
no more Facebook.

06:29.699 --> 06:31.927
Now, if you need to be stimulated,

06:31.928 --> 06:35.398
you've got that little
weather girl on the 6:00 news.

06:35.399 --> 06:37.432
Wait, you can't tell me
what to do on my Facebook.

06:37.433 --> 06:38.767
It's called "My Facebook."

06:38.768 --> 06:41.369
It's not called "Your Facebook."

06:41.370 --> 06:43.672
It's also not called "My Facebook."

06:43.673 --> 06:46.474
Joe, your little Facebook Web site

06:46.475 --> 06:48.109
is a reflection on me, too.

06:48.110 --> 06:49.544
You are my husband.

06:49.545 --> 06:50.813
No, not on here, I'm not.

06:50.814 --> 06:54.083
On here, I'm just
Joe Carmichael, raconteur.

06:55.452 --> 06:57.086
Look, look, Mom,
stop trying to take away

06:57.087 --> 06:58.254
his social media, you know?

06:58.255 --> 07:00.522
If he had a den that
he went to for refuge,

07:00.523 --> 07:01.724
you wouldn't take that away.

07:01.725 --> 07:03.425
If he had a garage
that he fixed cars in,

07:03.426 --> 07:04.694
you wouldn't take that away.

07:04.695 --> 07:06.455
Why are you trying to
take away his Facebook?

07:06.456 --> 07:07.957
But a den and a garage are private.

07:07.958 --> 07:09.131
Social media is public,

07:09.132 --> 07:11.446
and any time you want to put
something out there publicly,

07:11.447 --> 07:13.230
you need to consider
the people close to you.

07:13.231 --> 07:15.638
Especially when it's a
ridiculous tweet, like,

07:15.639 --> 07:19.508
"People on welfare shouldn't
be allowed to eat breakfast."

07:19.509 --> 07:21.176
Hey, hey, that is a
good thought, Maxine.

07:21.177 --> 07:22.311
I mean, think about it.

07:22.312 --> 07:24.380
They're building up
their strength for what?

07:24.381 --> 07:26.047
Like, what are they
doing later in the day

07:26.048 --> 07:27.351
that they need Wheaties for now?

07:27.352 --> 07:28.183
(Maxine scoffs)

07:28.184 --> 07:30.552
Cynthia, I completely support

07:30.553 --> 07:32.555
you telling Joe what to do.

07:32.556 --> 07:34.790
You know, Maxine,
I'm not concerned with the way

07:34.791 --> 07:36.424
you present yourself on social media.

07:36.425 --> 07:37.792
Why are you worried about me?

07:37.793 --> 07:39.160
Wh-What's wrong with the way

07:39.161 --> 07:41.063
that I present myself on social media?

07:41.064 --> 07:43.046
Well, if we're being honest,
Maxine, it's a bit...

07:43.047 --> 07:44.232
Scattered.

07:44.233 --> 07:46.000
Yep. All over the place.

07:46.001 --> 07:47.268
You need a brand, Maxine.

07:49.138 --> 07:50.706
I was going to say self-righteous.

07:50.707 --> 07:52.707
You know, y-you are kind
of all over the place.

07:52.708 --> 07:54.409
Your profile picture is

07:54.410 --> 07:56.846
a Eiffel Tower with a rainbow filter,

07:56.847 --> 07:57.946
and a pink ribbon in the corner.

07:57.947 --> 07:59.301
Wh-What are you supporting there?

07:59.302 --> 08:01.004
Like a, a gay Frenchmen
with breast cancer?

08:01.005 --> 08:03.285
Yeah, you can be very preachy, Maxine.

08:03.286 --> 08:05.220
Mm-hmm. I can only read
your posts on Sunday.

08:05.221 --> 08:07.555
That's when I'm already feeling judged.

08:08.457 --> 08:09.657
Wait, I'm sorry.

08:09.658 --> 08:12.088
So are you attacking me for
being socially conscious?

08:12.089 --> 08:13.535
For-for spreading awareness?

08:13.536 --> 08:15.040
JERROD: No, no, no. I'm attacking you

08:15.041 --> 08:16.743
for being dishonest, Maxine.

08:16.744 --> 08:18.712
I mean, if I only saw
you on social media,

08:18.713 --> 08:20.576
I would think that you
wake up looking perfect,

08:20.577 --> 08:21.482
and that you protest

08:21.483 --> 08:23.517
the one percent every single weekend.

08:23.518 --> 08:25.552
Okay. Well, then,
if I only read your tweets,

08:25.553 --> 08:28.355
I would just think that you're
some arrogant contrarian,

08:28.356 --> 08:30.309
who only says things to
get a rise out of people.

08:30.310 --> 08:31.644
- JOE: Yeah, that sound like him.
- CYNTHIA: That's pretty spot-on.

08:31.645 --> 08:32.793
BOBBY: Yeah, that him.

08:32.794 --> 08:33.994
Thank you.

08:33.995 --> 08:35.636
At least I'm honest, Maxine.

08:35.638 --> 08:36.870
Okay.

08:36.871 --> 08:38.894
So you would never complain
about what I do online?

08:38.895 --> 08:41.875
Pssh! No. Why would I care
about what you do online?

08:41.876 --> 08:43.577
The Internet's not a real place.

08:43.578 --> 08:45.713
It's more of an illusion
than democracy.

08:45.714 --> 08:47.848
Would you stop trying
to get that to work, man?

08:49.184 --> 08:50.250
Okay.

08:50.251 --> 08:51.752
Okay. What was that

08:51.753 --> 08:54.054
challenging "okay" for?

08:54.055 --> 08:56.323
Nothing.

08:56.324 --> 08:58.826
Mm! That tone and what she said

08:58.827 --> 09:01.895
sounds like they at odds.

09:01.896 --> 09:03.297
I'm intrigued.

09:03.298 --> 09:04.264
(phone dings)

09:04.265 --> 09:06.400
Oh! Oh!

09:06.401 --> 09:09.069
Vicki Colette just wrote
on my wall, "Hey, you."

09:09.070 --> 09:13.094
- (laughing) - How you go "hey,
you" somebody's husband?

09:14.242 --> 09:15.943
I can understand "hey,"

09:15.944 --> 09:19.479
but that "hey, you" is
just dripping with sex.

09:20.849 --> 09:22.349
You write her back and tell her,

09:22.350 --> 09:24.251
"Me and my beautiful wife Cynthia,

09:24.252 --> 09:26.920
we're doing just great."

09:26.921 --> 09:28.344
Well, how am I going to write that?

09:28.345 --> 09:30.279
That's going to make me
sound like I'm crazy.

09:30.992 --> 09:32.292
And I'd be lying,

09:32.293 --> 09:34.862
'cause clearly, we're not
doing great right now.

09:34.863 --> 09:36.497
Well, we would be doing great

09:36.498 --> 09:39.533
if you'd shut up and listen to me.

09:40.769 --> 09:42.102
Hey, y'all.

09:42.103 --> 09:43.470
Maxine, I saw the picture

09:43.471 --> 09:45.405
you just posted on Instagram.

09:45.406 --> 09:47.641
Girl, you are so brave.

09:47.642 --> 09:49.385
- Well, thank you, Nekeisha.
- JERROD: Wait.

09:49.386 --> 09:51.145
Wh-What is she talking
about? What picture?

09:51.146 --> 09:52.846
BOBBY: Okay...

09:52.847 --> 09:55.415
here we go. Ooh, damn.

09:55.416 --> 09:57.150
Yeah, that's brave, brother.

09:58.453 --> 10:00.154
Okay, I see what you're doing here.

10:00.155 --> 10:01.618
JOE: Oh, well, don't hold out on me.

10:01.619 --> 10:03.123
Let me see.

10:03.124 --> 10:05.492
Oh, yeah. That is brave.

10:05.493 --> 10:07.194
That is very brave.

10:07.195 --> 10:08.395
Maxine!

10:08.396 --> 10:09.897
You ain't got no clothes on.

10:11.533 --> 10:14.601
Is this what y'all
calling brave these days?

10:14.602 --> 10:16.069
Yes, I am naked,

10:16.070 --> 10:18.705
but all the important parts
are artfully covered up.

10:18.706 --> 10:20.307
I took that picture
in support of PETA's

10:20.308 --> 10:22.576
"I'd rather go naked
than wear fur" campaign.

10:22.577 --> 10:23.800
Yeah, well, it doesn't mention

10:23.801 --> 10:25.168
anything about PETA right here.

10:25.914 --> 10:27.114
And I ain't even thinking

10:27.115 --> 10:29.316
about them little animals, neither.

10:29.317 --> 10:30.484
Put the picture down.

10:30.485 --> 10:32.452
So this doesn't bother you, Jerrod?

10:32.453 --> 10:34.988
You don't want to have any say
in my social media accounts?

10:34.989 --> 10:37.658
Nah, nah. I'm good.

10:37.659 --> 10:40.360
You're a feminist's feminist, Maxine.

10:40.361 --> 10:42.563
I don't understand feminism.

10:42.564 --> 10:44.832
What's the difference
between being brave

10:44.833 --> 10:47.100
and just being a slut?

10:47.101 --> 10:48.702
That is exactly the point, Cynthia.

10:48.703 --> 10:50.737
No one would complain
if it was a naked man

10:50.738 --> 10:52.406
on the Internet, and call him a slut.

10:52.407 --> 10:54.261
Actually, there is a
really great article

10:54.262 --> 10:55.406
I would love to forward you,

10:55.407 --> 10:58.645
- where you could read all about...
- That's fine; you're brave.

10:58.646 --> 11:00.547
Maxine, I think it's great
that you're showing

11:00.548 --> 11:02.549
young women not to be
ashamed of their bodies.

11:02.550 --> 11:04.017
Well, I don't know, I mean...

11:04.018 --> 11:05.586
if I was a woman, like...

11:05.587 --> 11:08.522
this would make me feel
terrible about my body.

11:08.523 --> 11:09.723
Matter of fact, I'm a man,

11:09.724 --> 11:12.726
and it make me feel
terrible about my body.

11:12.727 --> 11:14.595
See, that's why I try
to avoid social media,

11:14.596 --> 11:16.797
because it's just too many problems.

11:16.798 --> 11:17.998
Plus, it prevents you

11:17.999 --> 11:21.101
from being able to
experience real life.

11:21.102 --> 11:22.803
That's why I limit my social media use

11:22.804 --> 11:24.137
to only when I'm driving.

11:25.640 --> 11:28.041
Once I'm out of the car,
I'm there, I'm present.

11:28.042 --> 11:30.711
Experiencing life.

11:30.712 --> 11:32.079
She's not lying.

11:32.080 --> 11:34.023
That's why I stopped riding
with her a while ago.

11:34.024 --> 11:36.483
It was a very nerve-racking experience.

11:36.484 --> 11:37.718
(phone dings)

11:38.586 --> 11:39.553
(laughing)

11:39.554 --> 11:41.255
Another update.

11:41.256 --> 11:43.257
Vicki Colette. She says,

11:43.258 --> 11:44.858
"I just got back into town.

11:44.859 --> 11:46.093
"I'm working at Chili's."

11:46.094 --> 11:48.161
Uh, "Stop by any time.

11:48.162 --> 11:50.097
Apps on me."

11:50.098 --> 11:52.532
Oh, no, Joe.

11:52.533 --> 11:54.868
You are not getting any free appetizers

11:54.869 --> 11:57.104
from any other woman
as long as I'm alive.

11:57.105 --> 11:58.071
I forbid it.

11:58.072 --> 11:59.673
What? You can't forbid me.

11:59.674 --> 12:03.176
I forbid you from forbidding
me for doing anything.

12:03.177 --> 12:05.245
Well, I don't think it's very smart

12:05.246 --> 12:07.814
to tell the woman
who cooks all your meals

12:07.815 --> 12:09.950
that you're going out to have free food

12:09.951 --> 12:11.451
with another woman.

12:11.452 --> 12:12.953
I forbid it.

12:13.855 --> 12:15.822
Well, maybe I don't want your food.

12:15.823 --> 12:17.858
Maybe I got some free
loaded potato skins

12:17.859 --> 12:18.992
with my name on it.

12:18.993 --> 12:20.594
I'm going to cash that in right now.

12:20.595 --> 12:22.129
Forbid me in my own home.

12:22.130 --> 12:23.764
Joe...

12:23.765 --> 12:25.666
you eat some appetizers
with that woman,

12:25.667 --> 12:27.267
don't think you coming back here

12:27.268 --> 12:29.202
to get some dessert with me.

12:30.905 --> 12:33.473
Well, they got some, uh,
(clears throat)

12:33.474 --> 12:34.942
lava cake...

12:34.943 --> 12:36.676
Did you use a metaphor?

12:37.578 --> 12:39.246
I'm still going.

12:39.247 --> 12:40.981
Joe!

12:43.359 --> 12:45.235
All right, Maxine.

12:45.236 --> 12:47.403
Just take the naked
picture off Instagram.

12:47.404 --> 12:48.404
(mocking laugh)

12:48.405 --> 12:50.377
Jerrod, I have never seen you

12:50.378 --> 12:52.145
squirm this much before.

12:52.146 --> 12:53.446
This is fun.

12:54.348 --> 12:56.784
Yeah? Maxine, this is
weird to me, all right?

12:56.785 --> 12:58.168
You know I got three text messages

12:58.169 --> 12:59.432
on the way home that said,

12:59.433 --> 13:00.813
"Hey, what's up with your girl?"

13:02.303 --> 13:03.436
Well, why should you care?

13:03.437 --> 13:04.637
I thought we weren't supposed to care

13:04.638 --> 13:06.341
what the other person
does on social media.

13:06.342 --> 13:08.074
You know what? I get it. I get it.

13:08.075 --> 13:10.276
I am feeding into
a double standard here.

13:10.277 --> 13:12.379
I am wrong. I am a jerk.

13:12.380 --> 13:13.747
Have I said any of the buzz words

13:13.748 --> 13:16.282
to get you to take that picture down?

13:16.283 --> 13:17.984
Look, there is an easy solution here.

13:17.985 --> 13:19.338
Just delete the offensive tweets,

13:19.339 --> 13:20.682
and I will take the picture down.

13:20.683 --> 13:21.821
N-N-No!

13:21.822 --> 13:23.790
No! Absolutely not, Maxine.

13:23.791 --> 13:26.059
That is infringing upon
my First Amendment right.

13:26.060 --> 13:27.027
Well, this isn't about your rights.

13:27.028 --> 13:28.495
Your tweets aren't illegal,

13:28.496 --> 13:29.796
they're offensive...

13:29.797 --> 13:31.131
and you are just saying them

13:31.132 --> 13:32.475
just to get a rise out of people.

13:32.476 --> 13:33.633
Oh, uh, and you're not?

13:33.634 --> 13:35.657
Really? That's what a naked
picture is for, Maxine,

13:35.658 --> 13:36.970
to get a rise out of people.

13:36.971 --> 13:38.071
All right?

13:38.072 --> 13:39.406
You are better than this, and even if

13:39.407 --> 13:40.607
you're not better than this,

13:40.608 --> 13:42.281
I still want you to
take the picture down.

13:42.282 --> 13:43.916
(chuckles) You know, actually,
I was a little worried

13:43.917 --> 13:45.245
about posting that picture,

13:45.246 --> 13:46.629
but now I like having it up there.

13:46.630 --> 13:48.148
It makes me feel strong, uninhibited.

13:48.149 --> 13:51.551
You posted a naked picture
online because you were angry.

13:51.552 --> 13:52.986
You revenged porn yourself, Maxine,

13:52.987 --> 13:55.522
and that's not how revenge
porn is supposed to work.

13:56.557 --> 13:58.231
Actually, you know,
the more you complain,

13:58.232 --> 13:59.499
the more empowered I feel.

13:59.500 --> 14:00.727
Fine. Fine.

14:00.728 --> 14:02.631
You know what? I'm going
to go to that bathroom.

14:02.632 --> 14:03.897
I'm going to take

14:03.898 --> 14:05.201
a provocative picture of myself.

14:05.202 --> 14:06.566
I'm going to post it everywhere.

14:06.567 --> 14:09.002
- Nobody wants to see that.
- Damn it, Maxine!

14:09.003 --> 14:10.170
Just take the picture down.

14:10.171 --> 14:11.237
Are you doing this for attention?

14:11.238 --> 14:12.539
'Cause that seems desperate.

14:12.540 --> 14:13.573
Wh... I'm sorry.

14:13.574 --> 14:14.841
I am not desperate.

14:14.842 --> 14:16.076
I am frustrated.

14:16.077 --> 14:17.544
'Cause I won't delete some tweets?

14:17.545 --> 14:20.680
Because you won't even
consider my feelings.

14:20.681 --> 14:22.182
The tweets bother me.

14:22.183 --> 14:23.700
Shouldn't that be enough?

14:23.701 --> 14:25.461
God, you are so stubborn.
I can never get you

14:25.462 --> 14:27.085
to do anything that
you don't want to do.

14:27.086 --> 14:28.221
That's not true, Maxine.

14:28.222 --> 14:29.725
Remember, when we went to the movies.

14:29.726 --> 14:30.924
I wanted to see <i>Mad Max.</i>

14:30.925 --> 14:32.492
You wanted to see <i>Pitch Perfect</i> 2.

14:32.493 --> 14:34.461
Remember? And what did we see?

14:34.462 --> 14:35.765
<i>- Pitch Perfect 2.
- Only because</i>

14:35.766 --> 14:36.830
<i>Mad Max</i> was sold out

14:36.831 --> 14:38.598
when we got to the theater.

14:38.599 --> 14:42.402
Because it was clearly
a better movie, Maxine.

14:42.403 --> 14:43.503
Why am I being villainized

14:43.504 --> 14:44.847
for having great taste in cinema?

14:44.848 --> 14:45.872
Oh, God!

14:45.873 --> 14:47.256
Why are those tweets so important?

14:47.257 --> 14:49.642
Why do you need the freedom
to be publicly offensive?

14:49.643 --> 14:51.244
Because it's fun.

14:51.245 --> 14:53.346
It's so much fun to
offend people on Twitter.

14:53.347 --> 14:54.850
It lets me know people are listening.

14:54.851 --> 14:56.216
In real life, I can only offend,

14:56.217 --> 14:58.418
like, one person at a time,
but on Twitter,

14:58.419 --> 15:01.454
I can offend the masses.

15:01.455 --> 15:03.656
Plus, would it make you
feel any better to know

15:03.657 --> 15:06.192
that my last tweet got 114 likes.

15:06.193 --> 15:08.428
My picture's at 800.

15:10.664 --> 15:12.565
You're a cold bastard, Maxine.

15:12.566 --> 15:14.167
Just take that picture down.

15:14.168 --> 15:15.935
- Take it...
- (phone rings)

15:17.304 --> 15:18.505
Hello?

15:18.506 --> 15:19.939
BOBBY: Hey, it's me, Bobby.

15:19.940 --> 15:23.142
Why are you coming
through on both ears?

15:24.078 --> 15:27.080
It seemed too late to knock, man.

15:27.081 --> 15:28.744
(sighs) Look, we got to
do something, man.

15:28.745 --> 15:31.514
Mom is on a Facebook rampage.

15:33.254 --> 15:34.854
Mom, what are you doing?

15:34.855 --> 15:36.623
I'm a cyber bully.

15:39.260 --> 15:41.828
Please don't say that
like it's a good thing.

15:41.829 --> 15:43.062
Ma, what's wrong with you?

15:43.063 --> 15:44.364
Ma, you know people can see

15:44.365 --> 15:45.428
what you're typing, right?

15:45.429 --> 15:47.433
It's okay. I need the world to know

15:47.434 --> 15:50.069
that Vicki "Muffin Top" Colette

15:50.070 --> 15:52.772
is a straight-up ho.

15:52.773 --> 15:55.275
You barely knew about
Facebook this morning,

15:55.276 --> 15:57.243
and now you're a cyber bully?

15:57.244 --> 15:59.112
Well, I saw Meredith Vieira's special

15:59.113 --> 16:00.580
about Internet shaming,

16:00.581 --> 16:04.217
and she was teaching
people how to bully.

16:04.218 --> 16:05.718
Are you sure she was teaching?

16:05.719 --> 16:06.886
Well, I learned a lot.

16:06.887 --> 16:09.188
Those 12-year old girls
are very creative.

16:10.427 --> 16:12.010
Yeah, they'll tear your heart out, man.

16:12.011 --> 16:13.645
Look, I got some 12-year old followers

16:13.646 --> 16:15.528
that just love giving me the business.

16:20.601 --> 16:23.403
Look, Ma, you are saying
things on Facebook

16:23.404 --> 16:25.305
that you would never
say to anyone's face.

16:25.306 --> 16:26.573
I know!

16:26.574 --> 16:30.109
It is so much easier
to trash-talk a person

16:30.110 --> 16:32.412
from the comfort of my own home.

16:32.413 --> 16:35.048
No, Ma, you gotta stop, all right?

16:35.049 --> 16:36.449
Think about everything
you're writing online,

16:36.450 --> 16:38.218
and realize that it exists forever.

16:38.219 --> 16:39.886
Once you put it out there,
it's out there.

16:39.887 --> 16:41.154
You can't get it back.

16:41.155 --> 16:43.022
And-and once your grandkids
start Googling you

16:43.023 --> 16:44.390
to see what you've done,

16:44.391 --> 16:46.292
they will never see that you've
gone to church every Sunday.

16:46.293 --> 16:48.628
They won't see that you
volunteered at some shelter,

16:48.629 --> 16:50.812
they'll only see that you wrote
on Vicki Colette's wall

16:50.813 --> 16:53.715
that she's a prostitute
only worthy of sailors.

16:54.301 --> 16:56.002
Damn! Oh, the imagery!

16:57.871 --> 17:00.273
Why are you two ganging up on me?

17:00.274 --> 17:02.909
Vicki Colette is the enemy.

17:02.910 --> 17:05.979
Now, if you cannot think of
something mean and nasty to say,

17:05.980 --> 17:08.080
don't say anything.

17:09.316 --> 17:10.817
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

17:10.818 --> 17:12.881
What are you doing here?
I told you not to come back

17:12.882 --> 17:14.753
after your little date with Miss Vicki.

17:14.755 --> 17:16.321
I didn't go see Vicki.

17:16.323 --> 17:17.624
What?

17:17.625 --> 17:19.459
You didn't go?

17:19.460 --> 17:21.861
Oh, my God! I've been putting
all this nasty stuff up...

17:21.862 --> 17:23.429
Oh, my Lord!

17:23.430 --> 17:25.598
How do you delete? How do you delete?

17:25.598 --> 17:27.800
(phone ringing)
Just delete, delete, delete.

17:27.800 --> 17:29.936
Ma, stop punching buttons.
You're calling my phone.

17:31.839 --> 17:33.439
What the hell is going on?

17:33.440 --> 17:36.309
Mom has been cyber bullying Vicki.

17:36.310 --> 17:38.745
Oh, baby. You love me.

17:40.247 --> 17:42.048
I do.

17:42.049 --> 17:44.384
Okay, this is wrong.

17:44.385 --> 17:45.985
Oh, I don't know what happened.

17:45.986 --> 17:47.387
I feel terrible.

17:47.388 --> 17:50.089
I was just sitting here
in the house all alone,

17:50.090 --> 17:54.460
and I was looking at her
Facebook page for hours.

17:54.461 --> 17:57.096
(sighs heavily)
I looked at all her pictures

17:57.097 --> 17:59.232
and all of her friends,

17:59.233 --> 18:00.833
and I read her quotes,

18:00.834 --> 18:03.970
and it just made me feel
insecure, you know?

18:03.971 --> 18:05.438
Like a high school girl.

18:05.439 --> 18:06.706
Mm-hmm.

18:06.707 --> 18:08.061
I know what you're talking about.

18:08.062 --> 18:09.685
This Facebook is getting
in my head, too.

18:09.686 --> 18:10.710
Jerrod, I don't know

18:10.711 --> 18:12.545
how you and Bobby can deal with it.

18:12.546 --> 18:14.449
I don't deal with it.
I haven't been on Facebook

18:14.450 --> 18:17.717
since the Great Parent
Migration of 2009.

18:17.718 --> 18:19.218
JOE: You know what it is?

18:19.219 --> 18:20.853
I think I got caught up

18:20.854 --> 18:22.655
trying to be this Facebook Joe.

18:22.656 --> 18:23.919
Now Facebook Joe is killing it.

18:23.920 --> 18:25.124
He's funny.

18:25.125 --> 18:27.148
He's being quoted in
barbershops every which where.

18:27.149 --> 18:29.162
He got rich, beautiful women

18:29.163 --> 18:31.431
inviting him out to fancy
meals all over the world.

18:31.432 --> 18:32.598
JERROD: I'm sorry...

18:32.599 --> 18:34.233
rich, beautiful women?

18:34.234 --> 18:36.069
Is that what you call
a Chili's employee

18:36.070 --> 18:39.038
that invites you down to the
mall for some appetizers?

18:39.039 --> 18:42.241
Well, I don't see no women
inviting you for free food.

18:42.242 --> 18:45.878
Now, the point is,
it's too much pressure

18:45.879 --> 18:48.047
trying to be this Facebook Joe.

18:48.048 --> 18:50.416
I created something
that's unsustainable.

18:50.417 --> 18:54.253
I mean, I can't make 53
people laugh every day.

18:54.254 --> 18:55.688
Besides, I mean, why am I trying

18:55.689 --> 18:56.956
to impress all them people?

18:56.957 --> 18:58.725
When the one person I
really want to impress

18:58.726 --> 19:00.269
is standing right here in front of me.

19:00.270 --> 19:02.905
Aw, honey, let's go to bed.

19:04.264 --> 19:06.607
All right, boys, it's time for
y'all to get up out of here.

19:06.608 --> 19:07.567
Night, boys.

19:07.568 --> 19:09.535
JOE: Come on. Come on, baby.

19:09.536 --> 19:10.703
CYNTHIA: Hurry up, Dad.

19:10.704 --> 19:12.572
All right. I'm coming.

19:12.573 --> 19:14.607
Hey, Dad, what do you
want me to do about all

19:14.608 --> 19:16.609
these Facebook posts Mom
put on Vicki's wall?

19:16.610 --> 19:18.273
Oh, leave them up.
I want the world to see

19:18.274 --> 19:19.812
these two women fighting over me.

19:19.813 --> 19:21.347
Remind everybody

19:21.348 --> 19:24.751
that Joe Carmichael is
killing it on Facebook.

19:24.752 --> 19:26.018
Oh, and, uh,

19:26.019 --> 19:28.988
your mama was right about Vicki.

19:28.989 --> 19:32.058
She sent me...
that picture right there.

19:32.059 --> 19:34.627
Not as revealing as Maxine,
but still...

19:34.628 --> 19:35.811
Yeah, still pretty revealing,

19:35.812 --> 19:37.897
and pretty brave for
a Chili's bathroom.

19:37.898 --> 19:39.766
All right.

19:39.767 --> 19:42.235
Do you think she washed her
hands after she took this?

19:42.236 --> 19:43.603
Mm!

19:43.604 --> 19:45.405
Okay, look.

19:45.406 --> 19:47.106
Delete this picture.

19:47.107 --> 19:48.374
Block Vicki for me,

19:48.375 --> 19:49.838
'cause I don't need that in my life.

19:49.839 --> 19:51.277
All right.

19:51.278 --> 19:52.512
JOE: Oh, actually... uh,

19:52.513 --> 19:55.214
Yeah, and I'll e-mail a copy
to myself, just in case.

19:55.215 --> 19:57.283
My man!

20:01.038 --> 20:02.519
(sighs)

20:02.520 --> 20:04.688
Maxine...

20:04.689 --> 20:06.771
I had some time to think, you know?

20:06.772 --> 20:07.972
And I got to be honest.

20:07.973 --> 20:11.476
I saw some things tonight
that I cannot un-see.

20:11.477 --> 20:13.278
Yeah, I saw your mom's Facebook posts.

20:13.279 --> 20:15.747
She uses racial slurs
like she's not black.

20:15.748 --> 20:17.582
Yeah. I know. I know.

20:18.350 --> 20:19.751
You know...

20:19.752 --> 20:21.815
I guess it goes without saying,
but I should say it.

20:21.816 --> 20:24.923
Maxine, nobody's opinion
means more to me than yours.

20:24.924 --> 20:26.257
I already took the picture down.

20:26.258 --> 20:28.660
Thank God.

20:28.661 --> 20:31.329
All right, Maxine, I-I'll
start censoring my tweets

20:31.330 --> 20:32.530
a little bit more, okay?

20:32.531 --> 20:33.914
And-and I'll make a deal with you.

20:33.915 --> 20:35.333
Once a month, you can delete

20:35.334 --> 20:36.601
my most offensive tweet,

20:36.602 --> 20:38.937
but only if it has less than 70 likes,

20:38.938 --> 20:40.672
and it's not favorited by a celebrity.

20:40.673 --> 20:42.173
And I get to define celebrity.

20:42.174 --> 20:43.475
Is that cool?

20:43.476 --> 20:45.020
You know, I can just
take another picture,

20:45.021 --> 20:45.810
and I could just put it...

20:45.811 --> 20:46.878
Okay, Maxine, don't take another...

20:46.879 --> 20:48.632
Well, at least put it
on Snapchat this time.

20:48.633 --> 20:49.742
- It goes away in 60 seconds.
- (laughs)
