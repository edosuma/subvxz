WEBVTT

00:01.556 --> 00:04.391
All right, I'm ready
for my next question.

00:04.392 --> 00:08.145
In a world where rhinoceroses
are domesticated pets,

00:08.146 --> 00:10.147
who wins the Second World War?

00:12.450 --> 00:14.351
Uganda.

00:14.352 --> 00:15.352
Defend.

00:15.353 --> 00:17.204
Kenya rises to power

00:17.205 --> 00:18.822
on the export of rhinoceroses.

00:18.823 --> 00:21.024
A Central African
power block is formed,

00:21.025 --> 00:23.127
colonizing North Africa and Europe.

00:23.128 --> 00:26.547
When war breaks out, no one can
afford the luxury of a rhino.

00:26.548 --> 00:28.933
Kenya withers, Uganda triumphs.

00:30.969 --> 00:32.052
Correct.

00:32.052 --> 00:33.370
My turn.

00:35.039 --> 00:39.410
In a world where a piano is a weapon,
not a musical instrument,

00:39.411 --> 00:43.197
on what does Scott Joplin
play "The Maple Leaf Rag"?

00:43.198 --> 00:45.983
Tuned bayonets.

00:45.984 --> 00:47.051
Defend.

00:47.052 --> 00:47.985
Isn't it obvious?

00:47.986 --> 00:50.554
You're right. My apologies.

00:52.057 --> 00:55.576
What the hell are you guys playing?

00:55.577 --> 00:57.328
It's a game we invented.

00:57.329 --> 00:59.530
It's called Counterfactuals.

00:59.531 --> 01:01.899
We postulate an alternate
world that differs from ours

01:01.900 --> 01:04.418
in one key aspect and then
pose questions to each other.

01:04.419 --> 01:06.253
It's fun for ages eight to 80.

01:06.254 --> 01:07.705
Join us.

01:07.706 --> 01:09.206
All right.

01:09.207 --> 01:10.674
I like a good brainteaser.

01:10.675 --> 01:12.259
Give it a whirl.

01:12.260 --> 01:13.844
You're in luck;
this is an easy one.

01:13.845 --> 01:16.897
In a world where mankind is ruled

01:16.898 --> 01:19.416
by a giant intelligent beaver,

01:19.417 --> 01:21.885
what food is no longer consumed?

01:21.886 --> 01:26.790
Uh... a BLT where the
"B" stands for beaver?

01:26.791 --> 01:28.008
I don't know.

01:28.009 --> 01:30.093
Leonard, be serious.

01:30.094 --> 01:31.862
We're playing a game here.

01:32.814 --> 01:33.930
I can figure this out.

01:33.931 --> 01:34.965
Let's see.

01:34.966 --> 01:37.735
Um, well, beavers eat tree bark.

01:37.736 --> 01:41.121
The only tree bark I know that
humans consume is cinnamon.

01:41.122 --> 01:42.740
So, I'll say cinnamon.

01:42.741 --> 01:43.774
Incorrect.

01:43.775 --> 01:47.261
Obviously, the answer
is cheese Danish.

01:47.262 --> 01:48.612
What?

01:48.613 --> 01:51.332
In a world ruled by a giant beaver,

01:51.333 --> 01:54.618
mankind builds many dams to
please the beaver overlord.

01:54.619 --> 01:57.004
The low-lying city of
Copenhagen is flooded.

01:57.005 --> 01:58.288
Thousands die.

01:58.289 --> 02:02.743
Devastated, the Danes never
invent their namesake pastry.

02:04.546 --> 02:06.347
How does one miss that?

02:07.866 --> 02:09.733
This is ridiculous.

02:09.734 --> 02:11.268
You're just making stuff up.

02:11.269 --> 02:13.587
Is he always like
this when he loses?

02:13.588 --> 02:15.005
Oh, yes.

02:15.006 --> 02:18.842
You should've been here for the
great Jenga tantrum of 2008.

02:20.478 --> 02:22.896
You bumped the table
and you know it.

02:26.334 --> 02:28.919
Perhaps it would be
kinder to play a game

02:28.920 --> 02:30.954
more suited to his abilities.

02:30.955 --> 02:34.758
We'll close our eyes and
count to ten while you hide.

02:34.759 --> 02:37.428
I'm going to my room.

02:37.429 --> 02:38.679
Very good, Leonard.

02:38.680 --> 02:40.848
But next time, don't tell
us where you're hiding.

03:08.576 --> 03:09.343
Did you guys see the paper

03:09.387 --> 03:11.438
in <i>The American Physics
Journal</i> on supersolids?

03:11.439 --> 03:12.639
It's pretty interesting.

03:12.640 --> 03:13.874
This guy's working from
a hypothesis where...

03:13.875 --> 03:15.859
Spoiler alert! Spoiler alert.

03:15.860 --> 03:17.644
What? Don't ruin it for me, man.

03:17.645 --> 03:20.480
I printed out a PDF
to read on the potty.

03:20.481 --> 03:21.531
On the potty?

03:21.532 --> 03:22.582
What are you, five?

03:22.583 --> 03:24.568
It's a potty. What do you call it?

03:24.569 --> 03:25.585
Toilet.

03:25.586 --> 03:26.570
That's a little vulgar for

03:26.571 --> 03:27.704
the dinner table, don't you think?

03:27.705 --> 03:29.823
Oh, and "potty" is okay?

03:29.824 --> 03:30.824
"Potty" is innocent.

03:30.825 --> 03:31.942
"Potty" is adorable.

03:31.943 --> 03:34.711
What do you do in the potty,
wee-wee?

03:34.712 --> 03:37.047
If I don't have to boom-boom.

03:38.049 --> 03:39.416
Greetings.

03:39.417 --> 03:41.585
You all remember Amy Farrah Fowler.

03:41.586 --> 03:42.802
Nice to see you. Hello.

03:42.803 --> 03:44.838
Sorry we're late.

03:44.839 --> 03:45.889
I must take responsibility.

03:45.890 --> 03:47.557
I had to stop for
feminine hygiene supplies.

03:47.558 --> 03:48.725
Aha. Okay.

03:48.726 --> 03:50.894
I believe she's
experiencing her menses.

03:51.846 --> 03:53.146
Actually, I'm not.

03:53.147 --> 03:54.898
In order to avoid surprises,
I wear them all the time.

03:54.899 --> 03:56.099
Aha. Okay.

03:57.068 --> 03:59.486
"Toilet's" sounding
pretty good now, huh?

04:00.605 --> 04:02.906
Hey, look, it's Shamy.

04:02.907 --> 04:04.241
Shamy?

04:04.242 --> 04:07.410
A juvenile amalgamation
of our names.

04:07.411 --> 04:09.946
Sheldon, Amy-- Shamy.

04:09.947 --> 04:11.281
Oh.

04:11.282 --> 04:12.282
I don't like that.

04:12.283 --> 04:13.333
Don't do that.

04:15.069 --> 04:16.418
All righty. What's new?

04:16.420 --> 04:19.005
Well, just recently, I learned
that you refer to us as Shamy,

04:19.005 --> 04:20.240
and I don't like that.

04:20.241 --> 04:22.075
I got it.

04:22.076 --> 04:24.861
But what I was going for was,
you know, how's your life?

04:24.862 --> 04:26.680
Like everybody else's.

04:26.681 --> 04:29.799
Subject to entropy,
decay and eventual death.

04:31.185 --> 04:32.485
Thank you for asking.

04:32.486 --> 04:34.271
Why is she not taking our order?

04:34.272 --> 04:35.472
I should've warned you,

04:35.473 --> 04:38.942
one has to navigate a
labyrinth of social nonsense

04:38.943 --> 04:40.610
before one can be fed here.

04:40.611 --> 04:41.945
Really?

04:41.946 --> 04:43.647
I assumed an establishment called

04:43.648 --> 04:46.449
the Cheesecake Factory would
function more efficiently.

04:46.450 --> 04:47.767
It's how they lure you in.

04:47.768 --> 04:50.036
I believe it's called "
bait and switch."

04:50.905 --> 04:52.906
Okay, I'm just gonna walk away,

04:52.907 --> 04:54.991
'cause... I don't want to be here.

04:58.829 --> 05:00.931
So, this is nice.

05:00.932 --> 05:02.782
First time we've all
gotten together to eat.

05:02.783 --> 05:06.069
You're right, he's a
festival of humdrum chitchat.

05:07.288 --> 05:09.055
Okay, that's all I got.

05:09.056 --> 05:11.308
Howard, you're up.

05:11.309 --> 05:14.811
Um... tell us about your work, Amy.

05:14.812 --> 05:16.513
I doubt you'd understand.

05:16.514 --> 05:19.266
Sheldon tells me you only
have a master's degree.

05:21.068 --> 05:23.653
Raj, do you have any
questions for Amy?

05:26.473 --> 05:30.060
I'm curious as to why
we're not eating alone.

05:30.061 --> 05:32.128
They can't function without me.

05:32.129 --> 05:36.983
I'm the social glue that holds
this little group together.

05:36.984 --> 05:38.451
You're welcome.

05:40.838 --> 05:43.707
Listen, can I talk to you
about your girlfriend?

05:43.708 --> 05:45.508
She's not my girlfriend.

05:45.509 --> 05:47.460
She's a girl and she's my friend,

05:47.461 --> 05:51.181
but there's no touching or
unsanitary exchange of saliva.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.050
Got it.

05:54.051 --> 05:56.019
Although, for the record,
on one occasion,

05:56.020 --> 05:58.671
she licked her thumb to
remove raspberry jelly

05:58.672 --> 06:00.523
from the corner of my mouth.

06:00.524 --> 06:02.942
It's an action we both
regret to this day.

06:02.943 --> 06:04.027
Uh-huh.

06:04.028 --> 06:06.363
Anyway, I'm not sure
she's the best fit

06:06.364 --> 06:10.016
for our little-- how should
we call it-- rebel alliance.

06:10.017 --> 06:13.403
Oh, I never identified
with the rebel alliance.

06:13.404 --> 06:15.822
Despite their tendency
to build Death Stars,

06:15.823 --> 06:18.074
I've always been more
of an empire man.

06:19.994 --> 06:21.027
Yeah, not my point.

06:21.028 --> 06:22.245
I know what your point is.

06:22.246 --> 06:24.297
You're intimidated
by Amy's intellect.

06:24.298 --> 06:26.750
To that I say, buck up.

06:26.751 --> 06:27.967
Okay, let me just

06:27.968 --> 06:29.052
get right to it.

06:29.053 --> 06:32.389
Amy is judgmental,
sanctimonious and frankly...

06:32.390 --> 06:35.659
just obnoxious.

06:35.660 --> 06:37.427
So?

06:37.428 --> 06:39.813
So we already have
you for all that.

06:41.182 --> 06:44.401
Are you suggesting I terminate
my relationship with Amy?

06:44.402 --> 06:45.819
No, no, of course not.

06:45.820 --> 06:48.905
Just have your relationship
someplace else.

06:48.906 --> 06:52.525
May I point out that
for eight long months,

06:52.526 --> 06:55.395
I suffered in silence
as your female companion

06:55.396 --> 06:57.614
filled our apartment with her

06:57.615 --> 07:00.450
off-key country music caterwauling,

07:00.451 --> 07:01.901
the unappetizing spectacle

07:01.902 --> 07:05.588
of her grinding a pumice stone
against her calloused feet

07:05.589 --> 07:07.207
in our living room,

07:07.208 --> 07:10.576
and night after night of
uninformative TV documentaries

07:10.577 --> 07:13.129
about the Jersey Shore.

07:14.632 --> 07:17.434
Suffered in silence?

07:17.435 --> 07:19.436
Yes.

07:20.921 --> 07:23.723
And I'd thank you to do the same.

07:25.559 --> 07:27.644
Reall-- Silence?!

07:30.815 --> 07:32.432
Ah.

07:32.433 --> 07:34.234
Nothing makes beer
taste better than

07:34.235 --> 07:38.221
cool clear Rocky
Mountain spring water.

07:38.222 --> 07:40.340
Where are the Rocky
Mountains, anyway?

07:41.842 --> 07:44.010
Philadelphia.

07:44.011 --> 07:45.028
Really?

07:45.029 --> 07:46.463
I thought they were
out West someplace.

07:46.464 --> 07:47.614
Think about it, Raj.

07:47.615 --> 07:50.984
Where did the movie
<i>Rocky</i> take place?

07:50.985 --> 07:53.553
Philadelphia.

07:53.554 --> 07:55.505
Okay, now I get it.

07:56.891 --> 07:58.091
So this is the plan?

07:58.092 --> 08:00.059
From now on, we're just
gonna hide out in here

08:00.060 --> 08:02.228
to avoid the Shamy?

08:02.229 --> 08:03.813
I'm very comfortable here.

08:03.814 --> 08:08.351
Penny, dear, why don't you shoot
another silver bullet my way?

08:08.352 --> 08:10.403
Get one yourself.

08:10.404 --> 08:13.656
Ooh, somebody's been
taking bitchy pills.

08:13.657 --> 08:17.310
God, he's an ass when he drinks.

08:17.311 --> 08:18.661
Oh, he's an ass when he doesn't.

08:18.662 --> 08:20.864
You just don't hear it.

08:20.865 --> 08:23.816
Think we need to start
entertaining the possibility

08:23.817 --> 08:25.668
that the Shamy could
go on for years.

08:25.669 --> 08:28.371
Well, if that's the case,
Penny will have to get satellite TV

08:28.372 --> 08:31.090
and maybe once a week run a
vacuum through this place.

08:35.179 --> 08:37.130
I thought you were going
to talk to Sheldon.

08:37.131 --> 08:38.998
I did. Well, what'd he say?

08:38.999 --> 08:41.134
Well, he pointed out that
he kinda sorta had to...

08:41.135 --> 08:42.602
put up with you.

08:42.602 --> 08:44.554
Kinda sorta had to?

08:44.555 --> 08:45.855
I didn't agree with him.

08:45.856 --> 08:46.856
Well, you defended me, right?

08:46.857 --> 08:49.692
I tried, but...

08:51.812 --> 08:56.015
...he made a fairly
well-reasoned argument.

08:56.016 --> 08:59.285
You're not doing that right.

08:59.286 --> 09:00.286
What?

09:00.287 --> 09:01.521
Gimme.

09:01.522 --> 09:02.739
No. Trust me.

09:02.740 --> 09:05.458
No! I do this for
my mom all the time.

09:07.361 --> 09:08.628
See?

09:08.629 --> 09:10.747
With the grain.

09:10.748 --> 09:13.366
Wow, that is better.

09:13.367 --> 09:16.052
And someday, when you
have varicose veins,

09:16.053 --> 09:17.971
I'll show you how to massage them.

09:21.642 --> 09:24.894
Oh, God, never again.

09:24.895 --> 09:27.880
I assume by "never again,
" you mean never again will you drink

09:27.881 --> 09:30.266
all of Penny's beer,
then run down to the gas station

09:30.267 --> 09:32.485
for a couple of 40s,
a box of Slim Jims

09:32.486 --> 09:36.406
and the latest issue of
<i>Bombay Badonkadonks.</i>

09:37.274 --> 09:39.592
I was homesick.

09:39.593 --> 09:41.694
The highlight of the evening
was when you showed us

09:41.695 --> 09:43.780
your Bollywood break
dancing skills.

09:51.422 --> 09:53.540
That's very offensive.

09:53.541 --> 09:55.625
Yeah, we all thought so.

09:55.626 --> 09:57.927
Oh, no.

09:57.928 --> 09:58.928
What?

09:58.929 --> 10:01.297
It's John and Yoko.

10:01.298 --> 10:04.050
More like Yoko and Yoko.

10:04.051 --> 10:05.751
Greetings. Hey.

10:05.752 --> 10:06.970
I brought Amy here

10:06.971 --> 10:09.222
to show her some of
the work I'm doing.

10:09.223 --> 10:11.608
It's very impressive,
for theoretical work.

10:13.394 --> 10:15.762
Do I detect a hint
of condescension?

10:15.763 --> 10:17.964
I'm sorry, was I being too subtle?

10:19.233 --> 10:21.401
I meant compared to the
real-world applications

10:21.402 --> 10:23.436
of neurobiology,
theoretical physics is--

10:23.437 --> 10:25.638
what's the word I'm looking for?--
hmm, cute.

10:27.575 --> 10:31.327
Are you suggesting the
work of a neurobiologist

10:31.328 --> 10:34.697
like Babinski could ever
rise to the significance

10:34.698 --> 10:38.051
of a physicist like
Clarke-Maxwell or Dirac?

10:38.052 --> 10:39.752
I'm stating it outright.

10:39.753 --> 10:41.754
Babinski eats Dirac for breakfast

10:41.755 --> 10:44.657
and defecates Clarke-Maxwell.

10:46.493 --> 10:48.661
You take that back.

10:50.481 --> 10:51.531
Absolutely not.

10:51.532 --> 10:52.765
My colleagues and I are mapping

10:52.766 --> 10:54.734
the neurological
substrates that subserve

10:54.735 --> 10:55.885
global information processing,

10:55.886 --> 10:57.987
which is required for
all cognitive reasoning,

10:57.988 --> 11:01.691
including scientific inquiry,
making my research ipso facto

11:01.692 --> 11:03.026
prior in the ordo cognoscendi.

11:03.027 --> 11:05.728
That means it's better
than his research,

11:05.729 --> 11:07.747
and by extension, of course, yours.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.535
I'm sorry, I'm-I'm still trying

11:12.536 --> 11:16.839
to work on the defecating
Clark Maxwell, so...

11:17.841 --> 11:21.377
Excuse me, but a
grand unified theory,

11:21.378 --> 11:23.963
insofar as it explains everything,

11:23.964 --> 11:27.016
will ipso facto
explain neurobiology.

11:27.017 --> 11:28.635
Yes, but if I'm successful,

11:28.636 --> 11:31.137
I will be able to map and
reproduce your thought processes

11:31.138 --> 11:33.022
in deriving a grand unified theory,

11:33.023 --> 11:35.892
and therefore, subsume your
conclusions under my paradigm.

11:35.893 --> 11:39.445
That's the rankest psychologism,

11:39.446 --> 11:41.848
and was conclusively
revealed as hogwash

11:41.849 --> 11:43.967
by Gottlob Frege in the 1890s!

11:43.968 --> 11:47.070
We appear to have
reached an impasse.

11:47.071 --> 11:48.738
I agree.

11:48.739 --> 11:52.375
I move our relationship
terminate immediately.

11:52.376 --> 11:54.377
Seconded.

11:54.378 --> 11:55.478
There being no objections...

11:55.479 --> 11:58.214
Uh-uh.

11:58.215 --> 11:59.916
...the motion carries.

11:59.917 --> 12:01.884
Good day, Amy Farrah Fowler.

12:01.885 --> 12:03.886
Good day, Sheldon Cooper.

12:08.375 --> 12:09.892
Women, huh?

12:09.893 --> 12:11.427
Can't live with them,

12:11.428 --> 12:14.847
can't successfully
refute their hypotheses.

12:14.848 --> 12:17.016
Amen to that.

12:22.638 --> 12:24.005
Hey, Sheldon.

12:24.006 --> 12:25.640
Hello.

12:26.759 --> 12:29.394
I hear you broke up with Amy.

12:29.395 --> 12:33.815
A breakup would imply
she was my girlfriend.

12:33.816 --> 12:35.433
She was a girl who was my friend

12:35.434 --> 12:38.870
who is now a girl who
is not my friend.

12:38.871 --> 12:42.457
Wow. That's like the
worst country song ever.

12:45.110 --> 12:46.944
So, how are you doing?

12:46.945 --> 12:48.212
Regarding what?

12:48.213 --> 12:49.347
Amy.

12:49.348 --> 12:51.449
I don't follow.

12:51.450 --> 12:56.671
Well, breakups-- or whatever the
hell this is-- can be tough.

12:56.672 --> 12:58.673
Penny, I assure you, I'm fine.

12:58.674 --> 13:01.843
My relationship with Amy
was purely intellectual,

13:01.844 --> 13:04.295
There were no emotional bonds,

13:04.296 --> 13:06.630
the severing of which would
cause me any discomfort.

13:06.631 --> 13:09.300
The relationship simply
outlived its utility,

13:09.301 --> 13:12.270
and I'm continuing on
with my life as before.

13:12.271 --> 13:14.155
Okay. Good.

13:14.156 --> 13:17.992
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm off to buy a pussycat.

13:20.245 --> 13:21.863
I gotta tell you guys,

13:21.864 --> 13:23.448
I'm a little worried about Sheldon.

13:23.449 --> 13:26.284
We're all a little
worried about Sheldon.

13:26.285 --> 13:29.320
No, I mean since the
Shamy hit a reef.

13:29.321 --> 13:31.589
Oh, I thought you were just
making a generalization:

13:31.590 --> 13:33.007
"You know,
I'm worried about Sheldon

13:33.008 --> 13:35.209
"someday setting off a
low-yield nuclear device

13:35.210 --> 13:37.962
because the cafeteria
ran out of lime Jell-O."

13:38.764 --> 13:40.348
What does "hit a reef" mean?

13:40.349 --> 13:41.883
Uh, went splitsville.

13:41.884 --> 13:42.884
Pardon?

13:42.885 --> 13:45.470
Turned to boom-boom.

13:45.471 --> 13:47.221
Ah.

13:47.222 --> 13:49.690
I think Sheldon really misses Amy.

13:49.691 --> 13:53.961
You should lend him your copy of
<i>Bombay Badonkadonks.</i>

13:53.962 --> 13:56.147
He got a cat to keep him company.

13:56.148 --> 13:57.148
You're kidding.

13:57.149 --> 13:58.399
He takes it everywhere:

13:58.400 --> 14:00.251
to bed, to the bathroom.

14:00.252 --> 14:02.203
He takes the kitty to the potty?

14:02.204 --> 14:04.822
I thought we discussed the P-word.

14:04.823 --> 14:06.390
Don't try to change me, dude.

14:06.391 --> 14:08.376
I am what I am.

14:08.377 --> 14:11.695
Oh, gentlemen.

14:11.696 --> 14:13.748
Hey. Aren't you going
to introduce us

14:13.749 --> 14:15.416
to your little friend?

14:15.417 --> 14:16.884
My apologies.

14:16.885 --> 14:21.656
Raj, Howard, I'd like you to meet Dr.
Robert Oppenheimer.

14:22.624 --> 14:24.926
Hello. Hi.

14:24.927 --> 14:26.210
Now, if you'll excuse me,

14:26.211 --> 14:29.730
the father of the atomic
bomb wants a saucer of milk.

14:31.567 --> 14:33.851
Okay, I get it.
We're worried about Sheldon.

14:33.852 --> 14:35.319
Yeah.

14:38.423 --> 14:40.158
Hey.

14:40.159 --> 14:42.677
Oh, no.

14:42.678 --> 14:45.279
Robert Oppenheimer was lonely.

14:45.280 --> 15:01.078
So you decided to get the
whole Manhattan Project?

15:01.079 --> 15:03.598
but he's so zazzy.

15:05.934 --> 15:08.769
Okay, we need to talk.

15:08.770 --> 15:10.021
About what?

15:10.022 --> 15:11.639
Cats, Sheldon.

15:11.640 --> 15:13.641
You're clearly upset
about Amy being gone,

15:13.642 --> 15:16.360
and you're trying to replace
her with a bunch of cats.

15:16.361 --> 15:17.945
Clowder. What?

15:17.946 --> 15:21.315
A group of cats is a clowder.
Or a glaring.

15:21.316 --> 15:22.366
Okay, yeah, fine.

15:22.367 --> 15:24.068
It's the kind of thing you ought

15:24.069 --> 15:25.736
to know now that we have one.

15:25.737 --> 15:28.990
Terrific. My point is,
you need to face up

15:28.991 --> 15:30.958
to what you're feeling
with this breakup.

15:30.959 --> 15:32.210
It wasn't a breakup.

15:32.211 --> 15:34.111
A breakup would imply that
Amy was my girlfriend.

15:34.112 --> 15:36.631
Okay, I got it, I got it;
she's not your girlfriend.

15:36.632 --> 15:37.999
Now listen to me.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.586
I know about loneliness.

15:41.587 --> 15:43.921
I know about trying to replace
someone with other stuff.

15:43.922 --> 15:46.807
When I broke up with Penny,
I got back into my cello,

15:46.808 --> 15:48.926
I built a bunch of model rockets,

15:48.927 --> 15:53.447
I got those weightlifting gloves
and that five-pound dumbbell.

15:53.448 --> 15:56.817
You didn't break up,
she dumped you.

15:56.818 --> 15:58.769
She didn't dump me.

15:58.770 --> 16:00.154
It was mutual!

16:00.155 --> 16:01.822
I was there. She dumped you.

16:01.823 --> 16:03.207
Okay, fine.

16:03.208 --> 16:04.492
Live with cats.

16:04.493 --> 16:05.776
Be like my Aunt Nancy.

16:05.777 --> 16:07.144
She had dozens of them.

16:07.145 --> 16:09.614
And do you know what happened
after she died? They ate her.

16:09.615 --> 16:12.283
You don't have to sell
me on cats, Leonard.

16:12.284 --> 16:13.501
I'm already a fan.

16:17.923 --> 16:22.176
All right, fellas,
who's in the mood for Fancy Feast?

16:22.177 --> 16:25.162
Well, that's not fancy at all.

16:29.935 --> 16:31.519
Hi, Mrs. Cooper. Thanks for coming.

16:31.520 --> 16:32.603
Where is he?

16:32.604 --> 16:33.771
He's in his bedroom.

16:33.772 --> 16:36.557
Now, when you said on the phone

16:36.558 --> 16:39.060
he broke up with a girl,
you meant an actual girl,

16:39.061 --> 16:41.562
not something you kids
whipped up in a lab?

16:41.563 --> 16:43.114
No, she's real.

16:43.115 --> 16:45.149
Did they sin?

16:45.150 --> 16:47.184
No, no, it's not like that.

16:47.185 --> 16:49.287
It's, uh...

16:49.288 --> 16:50.988
I don't know what it's like.

16:50.989 --> 16:52.907
But there is something I
should prepare you for.

16:52.908 --> 16:56.577
Oh, relax, Leonard,
I have raised that boy.

16:56.578 --> 16:59.130
I've seen him at his best,
I've seen him at his worst.

16:59.131 --> 17:01.749
There's nothing he can
do that'll surprise me.

17:01.750 --> 17:03.584
Hold on to that thought.

17:04.970 --> 17:06.387
Come in.

17:10.175 --> 17:12.376
Surprise.

17:12.377 --> 17:15.179
Mom, what an unexpected pleasure.

17:15.180 --> 17:19.016
My, my, that's a powerful smell.

17:19.017 --> 17:23.020
I'd like you to meet Oppenheimer,
Frisch, Panofsky,

17:23.021 --> 17:24.739
Feynman, Weisskopf...

17:24.740 --> 17:25.906
Yeah, I get it.

17:25.906 --> 17:27.692
You got a lot of cats

17:27.693 --> 17:29.710
and you gave 'em cute Jewish names.

17:29.711 --> 17:31.579
What are you doing here?

17:31.580 --> 17:32.830
Leonard called.

17:32.831 --> 17:36.066
And he said that you were
pining for a young lady.

17:36.067 --> 17:37.868
Oh, that's preposterous.

17:37.869 --> 17:39.904
I'm not pining over anyone.

17:39.905 --> 17:43.007
Oh, lambchop, we can
quibble what to call it,

17:43.008 --> 17:46.577
but I think we can
both agree it's creepy.

17:46.578 --> 17:48.679
I do not agree.

17:48.680 --> 17:51.032
Cats make wonderful companions.

17:51.033 --> 17:55.303
They don't argue or question
my intellectual authority,

17:55.304 --> 17:57.188
and this little guy here,

17:57.189 --> 18:00.441
I think you'll find
to be quite zazzy.

18:01.777 --> 18:05.229
You should have called sooner.

18:06.315 --> 18:08.566
Shelly! Dinner's ready!

18:08.567 --> 18:09.600
Coming!

18:09.601 --> 18:10.868
No cats!

18:10.869 --> 18:12.286
Aw...

18:16.325 --> 18:17.825
What is she doing here?

18:17.826 --> 18:19.126
I called her.

18:19.127 --> 18:20.177
Your mother thinks

18:20.178 --> 18:22.129
you might be losing
your mind over me.

18:22.130 --> 18:24.782
As a neurobiologist, I was curious.

18:24.783 --> 18:28.469
Well, rest assured, I am in
full possession of my faculties.

18:28.470 --> 18:31.589
25 cats!

18:31.590 --> 18:34.892
Oh, God bless you, dear.

18:34.893 --> 18:37.261
Sheldon, sit down. Let's talk.

18:37.262 --> 18:40.064
All right, but you're
not fooling me.

18:40.065 --> 18:41.282
Whenever you say we have to talk,

18:41.283 --> 18:42.516
it means you want me to listen.

18:42.517 --> 18:43.517
Then stop talking.

18:43.518 --> 18:45.319
Yes, ma'am.

18:45.320 --> 18:47.438
Now, the reason I
called Amy over was

18:47.439 --> 18:49.990
to find out what type
of person she is.

18:49.991 --> 18:51.659
And after chatting a bit,

18:51.660 --> 18:53.994
I have to say that while she is a

18:53.995 --> 18:57.498
<i>perfectly</i> unique young woman,

18:57.499 --> 19:01.018
you two are definitely not
suited for each other.

19:01.019 --> 19:03.821
That's a peculiar conclusion.

19:03.822 --> 19:06.273
By any standard,
Amy is more similar to me

19:06.274 --> 19:07.591
than anyone I've ever met.

19:07.592 --> 19:10.394
Oh, I'm sorry, Shelly,
I can't see it.

19:10.395 --> 19:13.297
Well, whether you see
it or not is irrelevant.

19:13.298 --> 19:15.299
I can't see subatomic particles,

19:15.300 --> 19:17.151
but nevertheless, they're there.

19:17.152 --> 19:18.269
Excellent point.

19:18.270 --> 19:20.003
A physics point.

19:20.004 --> 19:22.540
Touché.

19:22.541 --> 19:24.875
Well, putting aside the pig Latin,

19:24.876 --> 19:26.710
it's a good thing that

19:26.711 --> 19:28.662
you two decided to
end the relationship

19:28.663 --> 19:31.115
so I didn't have to end it for you.

19:33.602 --> 19:35.136
Amy, after consideration,

19:35.137 --> 19:37.338
I believe we may have acted rashly.

19:37.339 --> 19:39.206
I propose we resume
our relationship

19:39.207 --> 19:41.709
and attempt to resolve
our differences.

19:41.710 --> 19:43.661
I'll agree to that only
if you'll stipulate

19:43.662 --> 19:45.763
that 80% of our difficulties
were caused by you.

19:45.764 --> 19:47.548
I'll go as high as 40. Sixty-five.

19:47.549 --> 19:49.083
Done.

19:49.084 --> 19:51.085
You understand that moving forward,

19:51.086 --> 19:54.572
we deal with the fact that my
mother does not approve of you?

19:54.573 --> 19:57.541
I do. I find being cast

19:57.542 --> 20:00.227
in the role of bad
girl oddly titillating.

20:01.880 --> 20:03.647
Would you like to see my cats?

20:03.648 --> 20:05.766
I would. I love cats.

20:05.767 --> 20:07.101
They're the epitome
of indifference.

20:07.102 --> 20:10.921
Ah, then you may find
Zazzles a little cloying.

20:11.990 --> 20:13.774
I saw what you did there.

20:13.775 --> 20:15.860
He thinks he's such a smarty pants.

20:15.861 --> 20:17.244
He's no different from any man.

20:17.245 --> 20:19.613
You tell 'em not to do
something, that's all

20:19.614 --> 20:20.581
they want to do.

20:20.582 --> 20:22.082
If I hadn't told my brother Stumpy

20:22.083 --> 20:24.068
not to clear out the
wood chipper by hand,

20:24.069 --> 20:25.619
we'd still be calling him Edward.

20:27.255 --> 20:28.405
Now, don't you move.

20:28.406 --> 20:30.007
I'll bring over all the food.

20:30.008 --> 20:32.109
No, no, no, I can do it.

20:33.245 --> 20:36.113
Well, isn't that sweet?

20:41.241 --> 20:42.875
Thank you, Amy.

20:42.876 --> 20:44.376
Here's your cat.

20:45.462 --> 20:47.179
And here's your $20.

20:48.098 --> 20:49.799
Next!

20:49.800 --> 20:51.750
Thank you, Amy.

20:51.751 --> 20:52.935
Here's your cat.

20:53.804 --> 20:55.771
And here's your $20.
