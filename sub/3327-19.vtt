WEBVTT

00:02.799 --> 00:04.934
Yeah, that right, Chris.
FEMA officials are now saying

00:04.959 --> 00:06.633
that if you can get out
of the tri-state area

00:06.634 --> 00:08.684
before this storm gets here,
you really should.

00:08.686 --> 00:11.103
The National Weather Service
equating the severity

00:11.105 --> 00:14.223
of this nor'easter
with a category three hurricane.

00:14.225 --> 00:15.942
Now we're already picking up.
(screaming) Help!

00:15.943 --> 00:19.028
Sustained winds right here around...
Help!

00:19.030 --> 00:22.698
Please, someone!

00:22.700 --> 00:24.450
Help!

00:24.452 --> 00:27.370
What happened?

00:27.372 --> 00:28.537
He mugged me.

00:28.539 --> 00:30.489
Here, come on.

00:30.491 --> 00:33.409
(newscast continues
indistinctly)

00:33.411 --> 00:35.578
Let me see what happened.

00:35.580 --> 00:37.463
(French accent):
I don't want to hurt you.

00:37.465 --> 00:38.748
Just do as I say.

00:38.750 --> 00:40.082
Open the door.

00:41.784 --> 00:42.891
Don't!

00:42.892 --> 00:44.858
(gunshot)

01:00.854 --> 01:03.354
Let's go.

01:04.690 --> 01:07.225
(beep, tone chimes)

01:17.786 --> 01:19.871
(gunshot)

01:19.873 --> 01:21.956
Hey, I'm back.

01:21.958 --> 01:25.276
There was a run
on the storm stuff,

01:25.278 --> 01:28.946
but I got, uh, bottled water,
batteries, soup.

01:30.049 --> 01:31.799
Oh, hi.

01:31.801 --> 01:34.052
Um, I'm Joan Watson.

01:34.054 --> 01:36.521
Ms. Hudson.

01:36.523 --> 01:38.339
Pleased to meet you.

01:38.341 --> 01:40.558
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
we had a meeting.

01:40.560 --> 01:42.377
Oh, no, I-I'm not a client.

01:42.379 --> 01:44.779
(sniffles)
I'm-I'm a mess.

01:44.781 --> 01:47.965
Oh, do you want to talk
about it?

01:47.967 --> 01:50.168
You know...

01:50.170 --> 01:53.137
Love.

01:53.139 --> 01:55.607
You know what, let me...
let me put this stuff away.

01:55.609 --> 01:57.275
Uh, can I get you
some coffee?

01:57.277 --> 01:59.577
Uh, no.

02:00.746 --> 02:02.313
Maybe some tea.

02:04.316 --> 02:05.583
White Darjeeling.

02:08.654 --> 02:10.003
Ms. Hudson
is a fascinating woman.

02:10.006 --> 02:12.006
She has
an Oxford don's knowledge

02:12.008 --> 02:14.375
of ancient Greek,
but she's a complete autodidact.

02:14.377 --> 02:16.427
She consulted with me

02:16.429 --> 02:19.163
for several cases I worked
with Scotland Yard.

02:19.165 --> 02:21.966
Of course, you had more than one
case involving ancient Greek.

02:21.968 --> 02:23.851
Well, it's actually
a very fitting field of study

02:23.853 --> 02:26.187
for Ms. Hudson, considering
she makes her living

02:26.189 --> 02:28.106
as something of a muse.

02:28.108 --> 02:30.775
Well, "muse" is not a job title.

02:30.777 --> 02:34.195
Yet our Ms. Hudson
consistently finds herself

02:34.197 --> 02:36.013
in the company of
powerful men in crisis.

02:36.015 --> 02:38.149
A novelist

02:38.151 --> 02:39.784
who can't quite finish
his masterpiece here,

02:39.786 --> 02:43.371
a designer abandoned
by fickle inspiration there.

02:43.373 --> 02:45.707
Well, at some point these men
must realize that Ms. Hudson...

02:45.709 --> 02:47.208
Has a Adam's apple, yes.

02:47.210 --> 02:48.876
Of course.

02:48.878 --> 02:50.828
It's all rather complicated,
I imagine,

02:50.830 --> 02:52.380
but life is infinitely stranger

02:52.382 --> 02:54.365
than anything the mind of man
could invent.

02:54.367 --> 02:55.866
Cod liver oil?

02:55.868 --> 02:56.884
No.

02:56.886 --> 02:58.403
And what is

02:58.405 --> 03:01.205
the fascinating Ms. Hudson
doing in the library?

03:01.207 --> 03:04.892
She's recovering from her latest
romantic contretemps.

03:04.894 --> 03:07.228
For the last year or so,
Ms. Hudson has been

03:07.230 --> 03:10.715
the kept woman of a Davis Renkin
of 3T Enterprises.

03:10.717 --> 03:12.317
I gather Mrs. Renkin

03:12.319 --> 03:14.769
recently found out
about the arrangement.

03:14.771 --> 03:16.688
The salient detail
is she's been evicted

03:16.690 --> 03:18.439
from Mr. Renkin's pied-à-terre.

03:18.441 --> 03:20.491
Nevertheless, there's
a blizzard on the way.

03:20.493 --> 03:22.160
She needed a place to stay.

03:22.162 --> 03:23.661
Oh, so we have a houseguest now.

03:23.663 --> 03:25.697
Yes, would you have advised
I throw her out on the street?

03:25.699 --> 03:27.565
Of course not, but you know,
you have a lot of work

03:27.567 --> 03:29.066
to do
on this whole roommate thing.

03:29.068 --> 03:30.868
I mean, the polite thing would
have been to ask

03:30.870 --> 03:32.286
before inviting her
into the house.

03:32.288 --> 03:33.421
(phone vibrating)
You know,

03:33.423 --> 03:34.739
just like it's polite

03:34.741 --> 03:36.424
to clean up after yourself
in the kitchen.

03:36.426 --> 03:38.743
I clean the refrigerator once
a month; that was our bargain.

03:38.745 --> 03:41.412
Yeah, and once a month,
it is sparkling clean,

03:41.414 --> 03:43.914
and the rest of the time,
it is a science experiment.

03:43.916 --> 03:45.466
This is all rather diverting,

03:45.468 --> 03:46.917
but I'm afraid
it's gonna have to wait.

03:46.919 --> 03:48.436
Captain Gregson needs
our assistance

03:48.438 --> 03:51.472
investigating a homicide.

03:51.474 --> 03:53.274
(sirens chirping)

03:53.276 --> 03:56.427
GREGSON:
You guys got here fast.

03:56.429 --> 03:58.062
L Train still running?

03:58.064 --> 04:01.632
Yeah, orderly shutdown commences
at midday.

04:02.618 --> 04:04.268
This is, uh,

04:04.270 --> 04:05.870
Frank Dempster.

04:05.872 --> 04:08.072
The cleaning crew found
him at 5:00 this morning.

04:08.074 --> 04:09.957
He'd been dead
for about three hours.

04:09.959 --> 04:11.342
Thief was long gone,

04:11.344 --> 04:13.211
and nobody saw nothing.

04:13.213 --> 04:15.446
Yeah, security footage is gone?

04:15.448 --> 04:17.447
Yeah.

04:17.450 --> 04:20.951
Well, no sign of forced entry,

04:20.952 --> 04:24.806
so Mr. Dempster let
the murderer in.

04:24.808 --> 04:27.124
He was shot right there,

04:27.126 --> 04:29.093
dragged behind
this station,

04:29.095 --> 04:32.313
at which point...

04:32.315 --> 04:35.016
(indistinct radio transmission)

04:39.488 --> 04:40.971
He wasn't dead yet,

04:40.973 --> 04:42.523
the guard.

04:42.525 --> 04:46.828
He got off one shot
before he took a second wound.

04:46.830 --> 04:48.196
Agreed.

04:48.198 --> 04:50.615
The height of the bullet lodged
in the wall here

04:50.617 --> 04:52.083
and this blood splatter suggests

04:52.085 --> 04:54.702
that Mr. Dempster's final act

04:54.704 --> 04:58.589
was blasting a hole
through someone's abdomen.

04:58.591 --> 05:00.007
A through and through
like that

05:00.009 --> 05:01.826
would require
medical attention.

05:01.828 --> 05:04.011
Yeah, we put the word
out to all the hospitals

05:04.013 --> 05:05.963
in the city;
Red Cross storm shelters

05:05.965 --> 05:07.765
are gonna keep
an eye out, too.

05:07.767 --> 05:09.183
You said the killer was a thief.

05:09.185 --> 05:10.551
What was stolen?

05:10.553 --> 05:12.303
BELL:
The hot new toy.

05:12.305 --> 05:14.138
It's supposed to come out
at midnight tomorrow.

05:14.140 --> 05:16.891
I don't know who lines up
at midnight for a phone,

05:16.893 --> 05:18.342
but somebody didn't
want to wait.

05:18.344 --> 05:19.677
They took the floor models

05:19.679 --> 05:21.529
then got about 200
from the supply room.

05:21.531 --> 05:22.980
You're looking
for a group of thieves,

05:22.982 --> 05:24.899
one may be a woman,
and I suspect that "she"

05:24.901 --> 05:26.534
did the shooting.

05:26.536 --> 05:28.786
This hair is synthetic.

05:28.788 --> 05:30.521
It comes from a cheap blond wig.

05:30.523 --> 05:32.857
Probably got stuck
to the packing tape

05:32.859 --> 05:34.826
when they opened up a box
of Verzia 8s

05:34.828 --> 05:36.627
to verify its contents.

05:36.629 --> 05:37.995
Now, given the wig,

05:37.997 --> 05:39.881
I suspect that murdering
a security guard,

05:39.883 --> 05:41.716
not part of the plan.

05:41.718 --> 05:44.135
You think she had help.

05:44.137 --> 05:46.804
Well, hard to imagine her toting
all those phones

05:46.806 --> 05:48.723
after being shot
in the gut.

05:48.725 --> 05:50.258
So I'd say two accomplices,

05:50.260 --> 05:52.176
plus given the nature of parking
in this neighborhood,

05:52.178 --> 05:54.595
a driver to help
with the getaway.

05:54.597 --> 05:56.380
Just to be certain,

05:56.382 --> 05:58.900
uh, you want my assistance
in solving this?

05:58.902 --> 06:00.735
Yeah, that a problem?

06:00.737 --> 06:02.236
No, it's just...

06:02.238 --> 06:04.522
Due respect to Mr. Dempster,

06:04.524 --> 06:06.073
this is a garden-variety
robbery-homicide.

06:06.075 --> 06:08.058
You find the phones,
you catch the killers.

06:08.060 --> 06:10.695
So it's a bit...

06:12.414 --> 06:14.064
OFFICER:
What happened to the lights?

06:14.066 --> 06:15.232
Hey, what's
going on?

06:15.234 --> 06:16.734
Hey, Captain, sounds like

06:16.736 --> 06:18.536
(car horns honking)
the whole city is dark.

06:18.538 --> 06:20.571
We're trying to figure
out what's going on.

06:20.573 --> 06:22.540
Well, if I have to solve this
in the Stone Age,

06:22.542 --> 06:24.342
I suppose it might be
interesting after all.

She and our friends at FEMA

Um, sergeants,
I want you to take a look.

I want you to divvy up

a few hours

07:23.176 --> 07:24.458
before this storm hits.

07:24.460 --> 07:26.344
What I'm hearing
out of Philly,

07:26.346 --> 07:28.012
it's not pretty.

07:28.014 --> 07:29.913
The winds knocked out
a power plant down there,

07:29.915 --> 07:31.182
and tripped
the whole northeastern grid.

07:31.184 --> 07:32.883
So the power is not
coming back, folks.

07:32.885 --> 07:35.686
Coordinated deployment just got
that much more important.

07:35.688 --> 07:36.920
I don't think
that's what they had in mind

07:36.922 --> 07:39.190
when they said
essential functions only.

07:39.192 --> 07:41.559
This is essential; I'm conducting
a murder investigation.

07:41.561 --> 07:42.860
You're browsing Instagram.

07:42.862 --> 07:44.645
BELL:
Guys,

07:44.647 --> 07:46.397
I'm on rapid
response as of now,

07:46.399 --> 07:49.066
but I managed to squeeze in
a few calls on the murder case.

07:49.068 --> 07:50.618
I talked to someone
from Toshiwo,

07:50.620 --> 07:52.036
the company that
makes the phones.

07:52.038 --> 07:53.771
Wasn't good.

07:53.773 --> 07:55.740
Normally they'd be able to
track down the missing batch

07:55.742 --> 07:58.209
with GPS as soon as any of
the phones got activated,

07:58.211 --> 07:59.877
but the New York
office is shut down.

07:59.879 --> 08:01.462
Well, good idea.

08:01.464 --> 08:04.298
Thoroughly unnecessary,
but good idea nonetheless.

08:04.300 --> 08:07.752
Look at this.

08:07.754 --> 08:09.887
BELL:
Posted 45 minutes ago?

08:09.889 --> 08:12.006
These guys work fast.

08:12.008 --> 08:13.624
It looks like there's a
line in the background.

08:13.626 --> 08:14.842
That picture stamped
with a location?

08:14.844 --> 08:15.893
It may as well be.

08:15.895 --> 08:16.960
You see the shadow?

08:16.962 --> 08:18.896
Yeah, looks like a shadow.

08:19.564 --> 08:20.848
Direct your attention

08:20.850 --> 08:21.983
to the curvature there.

08:21.985 --> 08:23.801
The brutal postmodern sweep.

08:23.803 --> 08:26.303
That is the amphitheater
at Columbus Park.

08:26.305 --> 08:29.774
That is where they're
selling the phones from.

08:29.776 --> 08:32.809
That's the real thing, man.

08:32.812 --> 08:35.162
I can let you have it
for $75.

08:37.649 --> 08:39.500
(whistle blowing)

08:39.501 --> 08:41.836
Good afternoon, we are
employees of the NYPD.

08:41.837 --> 08:44.655
We need a few moments
alone with this gentleman

08:44.657 --> 08:46.157
to discuss stolen
cell phones.

08:46.159 --> 08:47.324
Thank you.

08:47.326 --> 08:51.095
Thank you.

08:53.348 --> 08:55.633
Private Maggio,

08:55.635 --> 08:59.353
you masterminded any slick
burglaries recently?

08:59.355 --> 09:00.721
What?

09:00.723 --> 09:03.140
No, I-I found
these phones, man.

09:03.142 --> 09:05.776
Ain't nothing wrong
with selling them.

09:05.778 --> 09:07.561
You found them?

09:07.563 --> 09:09.280
Where?

09:09.282 --> 09:12.015
Uh, Katy's,
the bakery on Beach Street.

09:12.017 --> 09:15.169
The lady there gives me
their old scones.

09:15.171 --> 09:16.654
I'm out back,

09:16.656 --> 09:18.372
asleep in the alley,

09:18.374 --> 09:20.291
and I hear this boom.

09:20.293 --> 09:23.411
Sounds like something big
getting throw in the Dumpster.

09:23.413 --> 09:27.164
So I get up
to check the old in-box,

09:27.166 --> 09:30.051
and there's all these phones
right there on the bottom.

09:30.053 --> 09:31.252
Hand to God.

09:31.254 --> 09:32.803
Did you see who left them?

09:32.805 --> 09:34.538
Couple of big
white dudes.

09:34.540 --> 09:36.373
I only saw them
from behind

09:36.375 --> 09:39.393
while they were running off
down the alley.

09:39.395 --> 09:42.212
Listen, your
prices are too low.

09:42.214 --> 09:45.433
Residents of this neighborhood,
they'd pay a bit more.

09:45.435 --> 09:48.352
Get yourself a room tonight.

09:49.571 --> 09:51.155
Come on.

09:51.157 --> 09:53.557
Wait, you're just gonna
leave the phones there?

09:53.559 --> 09:55.409
Well, the killers didn't care
about them.

09:55.411 --> 09:57.445
Why should we?

09:57.447 --> 09:59.330
No, the robbery of the phones
was a distraction

09:59.332 --> 10:01.064
to put us off the scent
of whatever

10:01.066 --> 10:02.900
they were really there
to steal.

10:02.902 --> 10:06.570
Let's get back to the Flatiron
before the taxis pack it in.

10:06.572 --> 10:08.339
REPORTER (on radio): The latest advisory
from the mayor's office

10:08.341 --> 10:11.258
is urging citizens to return
to their homes immediately.

10:11.260 --> 10:14.345
Hey, are you
listening to this?

10:14.347 --> 10:16.514
The advisory
is for citizens.

10:16.516 --> 10:18.466
We are not citizens.

10:18.468 --> 10:20.134
We're detectives.

10:20.136 --> 10:23.086
So if they weren't
the real target,

10:23.088 --> 10:24.605
what was, hmm?

10:24.607 --> 10:28.142
None of the other stores
in the lobby were robbed.

10:28.144 --> 10:31.112
Must have gone upstairs.

10:33.932 --> 10:35.599
But the stairs were locked.

10:35.601 --> 10:38.869
The guard's elevator card
was still in his jacket.

10:38.871 --> 10:41.605
You think they used it
and then put it back?

10:41.607 --> 10:42.823
I think the thieves
didn't want us

10:42.825 --> 10:44.125
to imagine they had access

10:44.127 --> 10:45.442
to any other floors.

10:45.444 --> 10:46.994
Don't you have
an app for that?

10:46.996 --> 10:48.379
Power is at a premium, Watson.

10:48.381 --> 10:50.581
Here.

10:53.618 --> 10:56.137
Note the shiny scratches.

10:56.139 --> 10:58.839
Someone was jittery
after they shot the guard.

10:58.841 --> 11:00.558
They made a real hash of it.

11:00.560 --> 11:04.127
See if I can do any better,
shall we?

11:04.129 --> 11:06.147
Any luck,

11:06.149 --> 11:09.767
and we'll find similar scratches
on another floor.

11:09.769 --> 11:13.437
HOLMES: So, the killers picked
the lock in the lobby,

11:13.439 --> 11:15.673
they walked up 12 flights
of stairs, they picked their way

11:15.675 --> 11:18.642
into this foyer, all so they could
gain access to...

11:18.644 --> 11:20.161
An architectural firm.

11:20.163 --> 11:21.445
Mysteries abound.

11:21.447 --> 11:23.747
Answers reside within.

11:23.749 --> 11:25.866
Want to give it
a go this time?

11:25.868 --> 11:27.818
(gasps)
MAN: Called the police,

11:27.820 --> 11:29.620
and we don't have
anything to loot.

11:29.622 --> 11:31.372
We're not here to loot
you; we <i>are</i> the police.

11:31.374 --> 11:33.040
Let me see your badge, then.

11:33.042 --> 11:35.325
Well... we're
<i>with</i> the police.

11:35.327 --> 11:37.995
Look, we need to come in.
We mean you no harm.

11:37.997 --> 11:39.763
And if you intend
to defend yourself

11:39.765 --> 11:41.665
with that knife,
you're holding it all wrong.

11:41.667 --> 11:45.669
My associate, Ms. Watson, she holds
several black belts.

11:45.671 --> 11:48.004
I just figured, go camp out
at the office, you know,

11:48.029 --> 11:48.890
get some work done.

11:48.891 --> 11:50.939
It's nice, I've had
the place to myself since

11:50.964 --> 11:51.776
I came in this morning.

11:51.777 --> 11:54.195
Hey, we should really hurry it
up; it's getting bad out there.

11:54.197 --> 11:56.146
Listen, man,
I'm telling you,

11:56.148 --> 11:59.283
I haven't seen anything
out of place since I got here.

11:59.285 --> 12:01.785
The computers and stuff,
they're all here.

12:01.787 --> 12:04.154
That's not what they were after.

12:04.156 --> 12:06.290
These drawers
not normally empty?

12:06.292 --> 12:08.692
Yeah, no way, we're seriously
crimped for space.

12:08.694 --> 12:10.861
Then they stole blueprints.
So they killed

12:10.863 --> 12:12.195
a security guard
and stole a bunch

12:12.197 --> 12:13.864
of smartphones as a
smoke screen so that

12:13.866 --> 12:15.699
we wouldn't know that
they wanted a drawerful

12:15.701 --> 12:17.051
of blueprints?
Interesting, isn't it?

12:17.053 --> 12:19.202
Squatter, we need to know
what the numbers

12:19.204 --> 12:21.371
9-2-Alpha-Uniform-5

12:21.373 --> 12:24.508
to 9-4-Gulf-Yankee-2-3 mean.

12:24.510 --> 12:26.477
It's year and job code.

12:26.479 --> 12:29.046
Everything's listed online, but,
you know, the system's down.

12:29.048 --> 12:31.181
We do keep all the plumbing and
electrical specs in the brown cabinets

12:31.183 --> 12:32.983
over there.
I need the ones that correspond

12:32.985 --> 12:35.519
to these missing blueprints
so I can see what was stolen.

12:35.521 --> 12:36.604
I can't just give you

12:36.606 --> 12:37.988
all of...
Tell me, do your employers

12:37.990 --> 12:40.223
look kindly on
vagrancy, do they?

12:44.062 --> 12:45.613
(groans softly):
Aw, damn it.

12:45.615 --> 12:47.731
Do you want
to know what helps?

12:47.733 --> 12:51.869
You just make a little tepee
out of the kindling, and it

12:51.871 --> 12:54.421
acts like a chimney.
Oh.

12:54.423 --> 12:56.340
Do you mind if I...

12:56.342 --> 12:58.509
(laughs): Oh. Please.

13:00.078 --> 13:01.929
(Watson sighs)

13:01.931 --> 13:04.048
(phone rings)

13:04.050 --> 13:06.433
Hey, I think your phone
is ringing.

13:06.435 --> 13:08.218
Oh, that's Davis.

13:08.220 --> 13:11.939
He won't stop until the
cell phone towers go down.

13:11.941 --> 13:13.757
(ringing continues)
The guy who kicked you out?

13:13.759 --> 13:17.061
He said he made a mistake.

13:17.063 --> 13:19.363
He said
he wants me back.

13:19.365 --> 13:23.984
But... he just wants
to stick me in some walk-up,

13:23.986 --> 13:26.737
give me a clothing allowance.

13:26.739 --> 13:29.773
I think it's fair to expect more
than that from a relationship.

13:32.443 --> 13:34.578
Nice.

13:34.580 --> 13:36.446
(knocking)
Merit badge.

13:36.448 --> 13:38.666
DAVIS (calls): Baby!
I know you're in there! Now...

13:38.668 --> 13:41.051
(knocking continues)
(whispers): It's Davis.

13:43.338 --> 13:45.055
I know she's here.

13:45.057 --> 13:46.974
I just need to talk
to her. Please.

13:46.976 --> 13:48.309
I think you should go home.

13:48.311 --> 13:52.346
DAVIS:
I love you, baby.

13:52.348 --> 13:55.516
I'll leave her this time,
I swear.

13:55.518 --> 13:57.518
It's okay.

13:57.520 --> 13:59.687
(wind whistling)

14:01.139 --> 14:03.473
WATSON: Hello?
(Davis and Ms. Hudson arguing)

14:03.475 --> 14:05.776
HOLMES: I take it Mr. Renkin
has come a-courting?

14:05.778 --> 14:07.161
(sighs):
So you noticed?

14:07.163 --> 14:08.946
Why are you hiding in here?

14:08.948 --> 14:11.832
Oh, be careful, I heated some
very large rocks on our grill.

14:11.834 --> 14:12.983
They're in here for warmth.

14:12.985 --> 14:14.835
Well, there is
a fire downstairs.

14:14.837 --> 14:17.338
There's also a lovers' tiff,
and I need to work.

14:17.340 --> 14:19.322
Now, these electrical schematics

14:19.324 --> 14:21.542
match the blueprints
that were stolen.

14:21.544 --> 14:22.993
Presumably, one of these places

14:22.995 --> 14:25.346
is a target
for the thieves.

14:25.348 --> 14:27.664
But viewed as a whole, they
comprise an incredibly mundane

14:27.666 --> 14:28.932
roster of clients.

14:28.934 --> 14:30.333
Unless the thieves are angling

14:30.335 --> 14:31.969
to steal onesies
from a Baby Gap,

14:31.971 --> 14:33.887
very difficult to see
what they're after.

14:33.889 --> 14:35.639
Listen, if you're gonna
be up for a while,

14:35.641 --> 14:37.608
will you keep your ears
open, because I don't know

14:37.610 --> 14:40.894
if those two are making up
or breaking up forever.

14:41.780 --> 14:42.846
Ow!

14:42.848 --> 14:44.398
What?

14:44.400 --> 14:46.567
Hot rock.

14:49.353 --> 14:51.538
Come on, rise and shine.
Got to get going.

14:51.540 --> 14:54.792
There's a <i>blizzard.</i>
Yeah, you should put on layers.

14:54.794 --> 14:56.326
Now, come on, please,
time to get dressed.

14:56.328 --> 14:58.862
It's not exactly gonna
happen with an audience.

14:58.864 --> 15:00.214
Mm.

15:00.216 --> 15:02.699
Are we fleeing from
the scene of a murder?

15:02.701 --> 15:04.334
Because Ms. Hudson
and her boyfriend

15:04.336 --> 15:06.837
were up half the night
yelling at each other.

15:06.839 --> 15:09.139
They've progressed to
the "quiet conversation" stage.

15:09.141 --> 15:10.373
Ms. Hudson assures me

15:10.375 --> 15:11.892
he will be leaving
within the hour.

15:11.894 --> 15:13.727
Now, I have ascertained
which building

15:13.729 --> 15:16.430
designed by Masslin & Associates
the thieves intend to hit.

15:16.432 --> 15:18.515
The answer is: none.

15:18.517 --> 15:21.218
It seems like a conversation
that can wait until I'm <i>clothed.</i>

15:21.220 --> 15:23.220
When I was reviewing
the accounting files,

15:23.222 --> 15:25.656
I noticed that several
of the stolen blueprints

15:25.658 --> 15:27.908
lacked the accompanying
plumbing schematics.

15:27.910 --> 15:29.827
These are jobs
that Masslin & Associates

15:29.829 --> 15:31.412
bid on but didn't get.

15:31.414 --> 15:32.946
One of particular note.

15:32.948 --> 15:35.643
A classified government job--
an addition to an existing

15:35.644 --> 15:36.316
government building--

15:36.341 --> 15:38.722
administered by the GSA.
What is that?

15:39.338 --> 15:42.456
It's the government's thrilling
General Services Administration.

15:42.458 --> 15:45.075
Now, architects approved
to bid on the addition,

15:45.077 --> 15:47.744
they had access to
the building's original plans.

15:47.746 --> 15:51.765
These plans were the real prize
the thieves were after.

15:51.767 --> 15:54.101
So, what building
are they planning to hit?

15:54.103 --> 15:55.853
EROC. That's an acronym:

15:55.855 --> 15:57.638
East Rutherford
Operations Center.

15:57.640 --> 16:00.190
It's a cash depository
and processing center for...

16:00.192 --> 16:03.277
the New York branch
of the Federal Reserve,

16:03.279 --> 16:06.429
home to the largest
cash vault in the world.

16:06.431 --> 16:09.283
I do not think for a minute
the timing is an accident.

16:09.285 --> 16:11.535
The thieves intend to use
the storm as a cover

16:11.537 --> 16:14.621
and strike when security is
at dangerously depleted levels.

16:14.623 --> 16:19.126
So they were waiting for a storm?
Yes. It's quite clever.

16:19.128 --> 16:21.662
I mean, global weather
patterns are producing more

16:21.663 --> 16:23.196
and more powerful storms.

16:23.197 --> 16:25.358
You have a list of targets
and cities that are likely to be struck.

16:25.835 --> 16:28.385
You have a plan in place
when the weather strikes.

16:28.387 --> 16:31.054
The ensuing chaos when police
are otherwise engaged--

16:31.056 --> 16:32.506
ideal time for a robbery.

16:32.508 --> 16:34.007
Oh, good, you're ready.

16:34.976 --> 16:36.677
(loud sigh)

16:36.679 --> 16:38.011
Did you call
Captain Gregson yet?

16:38.013 --> 16:40.063
I lost cell phone
service at 3:00 a.m.

16:40.065 --> 16:41.482
The landline
is down as well,

16:41.484 --> 16:43.684
and I cannibalized
the echo board on my CB radio

16:43.686 --> 16:44.985
for an experiment
last week,

16:44.987 --> 16:47.470
so we have <i>no</i> way
to contact the police.

16:47.472 --> 16:51.074
We know that this team is
capable of murder when provoked.

16:51.076 --> 16:53.160
We're gonna have
to stop this ourselves.

16:53.162 --> 16:55.412
Hold on.
How are we gonna stop it?

16:55.414 --> 16:57.698
I don't know-- I'll think
of something on the way.

16:57.700 --> 17:00.784
It's a long trek
to East Rutherford.

17:00.786 --> 17:03.337
(wind whistling)

17:32.395 --> 17:34.997
(lively music playing
over radio)

17:41.204 --> 17:43.422
Hello. Sorry.
Shouldn't you be plowing?

17:43.424 --> 17:45.841
I'm on standby.
Who the hell are you?

17:45.843 --> 17:47.509
My name's Sherlock Holmes.

17:47.511 --> 17:48.594
This is my associate,

17:48.596 --> 17:50.012
Joan Watson.

17:50.014 --> 17:51.597
We're assisting the NYPD

17:51.599 --> 17:53.799
with a matter
in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

17:53.801 --> 17:56.685
Why is the NYPD helping
with something in Jersey?

17:56.687 --> 17:57.937
It's a bit complicated.

17:57.939 --> 17:59.438
Well, do you mind if we come in,

17:59.440 --> 18:01.390
just to escape
this bone-freezing agony?

18:01.392 --> 18:03.108
Come on.

18:03.110 --> 18:04.443
Thank you.

18:06.529 --> 18:08.096
(lively music continues)

18:08.098 --> 18:09.231
(groans)

18:09.233 --> 18:11.867
Oh! (exhales)

18:11.869 --> 18:13.569
(turns off music)
Oh, thank you.

18:13.571 --> 18:16.538
Hey, hey, I was listening to that.
HOLMES: Right.

18:16.540 --> 18:17.957
Would you raise the police?

18:17.959 --> 18:20.209
We need to speak
to the 11th precinct, please.

18:20.211 --> 18:21.377
It's rather urgent.

18:21.379 --> 18:23.629
Breaker Nine,
this is Pam

18:23.631 --> 18:26.281
calling from a plow
truck in Greenpoint.

18:26.283 --> 18:28.801
I need police dispatch,
11th precinct.

18:28.803 --> 18:30.619
(brief radio static)

18:30.621 --> 18:33.589
On the line for a bear
with ears. Come back.

18:33.591 --> 18:36.258
Your CB handle is "Pam"?

18:36.260 --> 18:38.126
DISPATCHER: Copy, Pam.
This is the 11th precinct.

18:38.128 --> 18:40.763
You're on the emergency channel.
State your business.

18:40.765 --> 18:43.849
This is Sherlock Holmes,
guest of Pam

18:43.851 --> 18:46.468
and consultant with NYPD.

18:46.470 --> 18:48.320
Need to speak
with Captain Gregson.

18:48.322 --> 18:51.023
I can't put you on
with Captain Gregson, sir.

18:51.025 --> 18:53.976
He's not here at the station.
There's a storm.

18:53.978 --> 18:55.744
A storm, you say?

18:55.746 --> 18:58.080
We shall be on the lookout.

18:58.082 --> 19:00.649
Could you give him this message?

19:00.651 --> 19:05.087
Fairly certain E-R-O-C
will be robbed today.

19:05.089 --> 19:07.957
Connected
to security guard murder.

19:07.959 --> 19:10.843
Sherlock Holmes. Over.

19:10.845 --> 19:12.344
(brief radio static)
Right.

19:12.346 --> 19:14.346
We need to get
to East Rutherford, New Jersey.

19:14.348 --> 19:16.015
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
I thought the whole reason

19:16.017 --> 19:18.667
we left the house was because
we could not reach the police.

19:18.669 --> 19:21.103
Well, we have no idea if they're
going to get the message.

19:21.105 --> 19:22.805
Or if the authorities
can seem to spare the manpower

19:22.807 --> 19:24.673
if, by some miracle,
they do get the message.

19:24.675 --> 19:26.809
And we don't even have
any proof. No,

19:26.811 --> 19:28.753
the most sensible course is
for us to go to EROC ourselves.

19:28.778 --> 19:30.113
And do what?

19:30.114 --> 19:31.513
What if there are
50 commandos

19:31.515 --> 19:33.782
shooting up the place?
Well, I have my whistle.

19:33.784 --> 19:35.350
I don't know what's
gonna happen next!

19:35.352 --> 19:37.119
That's what makes
this an adventure.

19:37.121 --> 19:39.738
But someone has to try and race
ahead and warn the guards.

19:39.740 --> 19:42.408
So, Pam, very sorry to do this,
but we're commandeering

19:42.410 --> 19:45.294
this vehicle on behalf
of the NYPD. And let's go.

19:45.296 --> 19:46.662
You, get out.

19:46.664 --> 19:49.631
You, I can give a ride
home to if you want.

19:49.633 --> 19:52.217
All right,
forget the commandeering.

19:52.219 --> 19:55.587
Let's just call it a rental,
shall we?

20:00.593 --> 20:02.044
Hey, uh...

20:02.046 --> 20:03.395
Vince?
Yeah.

20:03.397 --> 20:04.546
Yeah. Detective Bell.

20:04.548 --> 20:06.365
I radioed in
a little while ago.

20:06.367 --> 20:08.734
Uh, I think we spoke.
I double-checked.

20:08.736 --> 20:10.736
We haven't had
a gunshot victim in two weeks.

20:10.738 --> 20:12.237
Right. No,

20:12.239 --> 20:14.106
but here's the thing,
none of the hospitals

20:14.108 --> 20:16.058
near the shooting
had anybody come in,

20:16.060 --> 20:18.410
so now I'm just making the rounds
looking for a patient

20:18.412 --> 20:20.446
with any kind of abdominal wound.
Thought maybe

20:20.448 --> 20:22.898
the person I'm looking
for came in with a different story.

20:22.900 --> 20:25.084
Well, it's hard to explain
you got a bullet wound

20:25.086 --> 20:26.401
by falling down the stairs.

20:26.403 --> 20:27.753
Give me a break, man.

20:27.755 --> 20:31.423
I got 20 minutes off
from snow patrol.

20:31.425 --> 20:33.258
Um...

20:35.428 --> 20:36.578
Um...

20:36.580 --> 20:40.415
we do have one young woman.

20:40.417 --> 20:42.518
She's about to be discharged.
She was stabbed.

20:42.520 --> 20:43.969
Alysa Darvin.

20:43.971 --> 20:45.220
Hm.

20:45.222 --> 20:47.556
(knocking)
I'm decent.

20:47.558 --> 20:49.308
Ms. Darvin?

20:49.310 --> 20:51.710
Detective Bell, NYPD.

20:51.712 --> 20:53.812
Oh. I thought
you were a nurse.

20:53.814 --> 20:56.598
They keep stopping by trying
to talk me out of leaving.

20:56.600 --> 20:58.067
Yeah, why <i>are</i> you leaving?

20:58.069 --> 21:00.035
No health insurance.
Nobody can say for sure

21:00.037 --> 21:01.269
that they won't charge me

21:01.271 --> 21:02.938
if I stay through
the storm, so...

21:02.940 --> 21:03.989
(quiet groan)

21:03.991 --> 21:06.875
I'm all stitched up.

21:06.877 --> 21:08.627
So, is this
good news?

21:08.629 --> 21:10.129
You guys find
the bastard?

21:10.131 --> 21:11.279
Hm?

21:11.281 --> 21:14.500
(laughs):
Well... the mugger.

21:14.502 --> 21:16.718
The guy who stabbed me.

21:16.720 --> 21:19.138
No, sorry.
This is about something else.

21:19.140 --> 21:21.974
Parking tickets?

21:21.976 --> 21:24.126
No, no, you're not
in any trouble. I just...

21:24.128 --> 21:26.395
You mind if I take a look
at your chart?

21:26.397 --> 21:28.463
Yeah.

21:32.318 --> 21:34.119
Two lacerations.

21:34.121 --> 21:35.387
Ouch.

21:35.389 --> 21:37.156
Can you tell me
what happened?

21:37.158 --> 21:39.691
Well, uh... okay.
Well, um,

21:39.693 --> 21:43.478
this guy with a beard,
he steps out with a kitchen knife.

21:43.480 --> 21:44.980
I gave him my purse, but...

21:44.982 --> 21:47.249
he said I was mouthy.

21:47.251 --> 21:48.367
You have a...

21:48.369 --> 21:50.452
blond hair on your coat.

21:50.454 --> 21:54.339
Yeah, I loaned it to my friend
last week, so... must be hers.

22:04.217 --> 22:05.934
Okay.

22:07.554 --> 22:09.972
Just one
more question.

22:09.974 --> 22:13.392
What hurt worse, getting shot
or letting your friend stab you

22:13.394 --> 22:15.277
to disguise the wound?

22:15.279 --> 22:17.396
What?

22:17.398 --> 22:19.181
You see that?

22:19.183 --> 22:20.199
It's melted.

22:20.201 --> 22:21.450
Real hair doesn't do that.

22:21.452 --> 22:22.868
It came from a wig.

22:22.870 --> 22:24.536
Like the one
you were wearing

22:24.538 --> 22:26.905
when you shot
a security guard last night.

22:26.907 --> 22:29.191
I don't know what
you're talking about.

22:29.193 --> 22:31.743
Right. Well, since you're
checking out anyway,

22:31.745 --> 22:35.380
I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to insist on giving you a ride.

22:35.382 --> 22:38.033
(handcuffs rattle)

22:38.035 --> 22:40.669
PAM:
<i>So, you're with the NYPD</i>

22:40.671 --> 22:42.471
but you're not cops.

22:42.473 --> 22:44.640
How does that
work, exactly?

22:44.642 --> 22:46.041
We met your price, Pam.

22:46.043 --> 22:49.645
I assumed it included
freedom from small talk.

22:51.731 --> 22:55.350
He gets carsick,
like a six-year-old.

22:55.352 --> 22:57.069
We consult.

22:57.071 --> 22:59.655
Oh, I got a bar;
I'm gonna try the home line,

22:59.657 --> 23:02.157
see if the landlines
are working now, maybe.

23:02.159 --> 23:04.443
Why on earth
would you call our house?

23:04.445 --> 23:06.612
Well, because every time I call
the police I get a weird signal.

23:06.614 --> 23:08.203
I just want to make sure that
Davis is out of the house

23:08.228 --> 23:09.415
and Ms. Hudson is okay.

23:09.416 --> 23:12.417
WOMAN (recorded): The number
you have dialed is not in service.

23:12.419 --> 23:15.587
Please check the number
and try again.

23:15.589 --> 23:16.838
The number is
out of service,

23:16.840 --> 23:18.457
and it is not
because of an emergency.

23:18.459 --> 23:20.342
Do you have any idea
why that would be...

23:20.344 --> 23:22.844
Did you not pay
the phone bill?

23:22.846 --> 23:24.763
In this day and age
a landline

23:24.765 --> 23:26.882
is like an appendix
or a vestigial tail.

23:26.884 --> 23:28.483
I don't know
why you care anyway.

23:28.485 --> 23:30.686
Yesterday you complained
when I took Ms. Hudson in.

23:30.688 --> 23:32.638
Yesterday I was upset because
you brought a stranger

23:32.640 --> 23:34.606
into our shared living space
without asking.

23:34.608 --> 23:36.058
Today she's
no longer a stranger.

23:36.060 --> 23:37.693
I like Ms. Hudson.

23:37.695 --> 23:38.927
You know, she's lost.
She's just trying

23:38.929 --> 23:40.646
to figure herself out.
You identify with her.

23:40.648 --> 23:42.076
She's like you were
before you met me.

23:42.101 --> 23:42.899
What?

23:42.900 --> 23:45.150
HOLMES: Lost, trying to figure yourself out.
No, I reject

23:45.152 --> 23:46.818
that analogy.
I just want to help her.

23:46.820 --> 23:48.704
I think it would
be good if Ms. Hudson

23:48.706 --> 23:51.156
learned to take care
of herself, that's all.

23:51.158 --> 23:54.793
Well done, Pam.
We're here.

24:01.918 --> 24:03.335
MAN:
Little early for a plow,

24:03.337 --> 24:05.620
isn't it?
Still coming down.

24:05.622 --> 24:07.139
We're not here
to shovel snow.

24:07.141 --> 24:08.390
There's an emergency.

24:11.177 --> 24:14.680
You want to know why
today's your lucky day?

24:14.682 --> 24:17.799
Normally these tests don't
take any time at all.

24:17.801 --> 24:20.519
But... we got no power.

24:20.521 --> 24:22.404
Can't run the test.

24:23.489 --> 24:27.475
Means you have a little
window to be smart here.

24:27.477 --> 24:30.445
If you're ready to tell me
what I already know--

24:30.447 --> 24:32.314
that you killed Frank Dempster,

24:32.316 --> 24:35.334
that you and your buddies stole
200 Verzia 8 phones--

24:35.336 --> 24:37.819
I'll get a D.A. in here
and cut you a deal.

24:37.821 --> 24:39.288
You know what,
why don't you shove...

24:39.290 --> 24:42.591
GREGSON:
Sorry to interrupt, but...

24:42.593 --> 24:46.378
sounded like a no.

24:46.380 --> 24:49.848
So... let's
switch gears.

24:51.167 --> 24:54.002
Why don't you tell us
about EROC.

24:54.004 --> 24:55.904
MAN:
<i>You say you're with the NYPD,</i>

24:55.906 --> 24:58.557
but we can't raise anybody
on the radio to confirm that.

24:58.559 --> 25:01.509
HOLMES: They're a bit busy dealing
with the storm of the century.

25:01.511 --> 25:03.445
Well, be that as it
may, there's no way

25:03.447 --> 25:04.896
we're letting you past
the control room.

25:04.898 --> 25:07.032
Nobody gets past
the control room.

25:07.034 --> 25:10.535
This entire facility
is automated, Mr. Holmes.

25:10.537 --> 25:13.071
Most days, nobody's allowed
on the cash floor.

25:13.073 --> 25:15.791
Automated vehicles--
our AGVs--

25:15.793 --> 25:17.542
they unload pallets of bills

25:17.544 --> 25:19.527
from the armored trucks
that bring in the deposits.

25:19.529 --> 25:21.196
Then they take them
into the vaults

25:21.198 --> 25:23.215
for processing and storage.

25:23.217 --> 25:25.834
It's all commanded remotely
from rooms like these.

25:25.836 --> 25:28.337
There's no way...
no chance

25:28.339 --> 25:31.873
you could get into
our vault directly.

25:33.226 --> 25:35.043
Huh.

25:35.045 --> 25:36.395
Is something wrong?

25:36.397 --> 25:37.929
Nothing. It's all there
and accounted for.

25:37.931 --> 25:41.650
I just didn't realize
they were doing a sort today.

25:41.652 --> 25:44.369
Steve, did you hear about this?
Machines ran about 980.

25:44.371 --> 25:46.021
An unscheduled,
unsupervised sort

25:46.023 --> 25:48.907
of nearly a billion dollars
run on auxiliary power.

25:48.909 --> 25:51.026
Okay, yes, it's
weird, but...

25:51.028 --> 25:52.828
nothing's missing.

25:52.830 --> 25:55.697
All the bills that ran through
the machines are accounted for.

25:55.699 --> 25:57.249
System's tamperproof.

25:57.251 --> 25:59.368
You destroy currency at
this facility, do you not?

25:59.370 --> 26:01.119
Sure, if a bill gets
too worn out

26:01.121 --> 26:02.337
it gets sifted out and shredded.

26:02.339 --> 26:04.573
Can we see where?

26:04.575 --> 26:06.241
The money's already been
shredded, has it not?

26:06.243 --> 26:09.211
Ms. Watson and myself are not
here to steal confetti.

26:09.213 --> 26:12.347
MAN: Our processing machines read
70,000 bills an hour.

26:12.349 --> 26:14.850
These bills are
from this morning's shred.

26:14.852 --> 26:18.603
Just under $33 million.

26:18.605 --> 26:20.138
That's about average
for four hours.

26:20.140 --> 26:21.423
It's all here.

26:21.425 --> 26:23.692
(spits) Something was
shredded here this morning,

26:23.694 --> 26:25.944
but it's not U.S. currency.

26:25.946 --> 26:27.729
This is supposed
to be cotton.

26:27.731 --> 26:29.731
This is regular paper.
This is fake.

26:29.733 --> 26:31.950
That's not possible.
Well, you be sure to mention that

26:31.952 --> 26:34.486
in your exit
interview. Yeah.

26:34.488 --> 26:36.455
Well, it's hard to say
how the thieves got in,

26:36.457 --> 26:38.123
not without access to the
blueprints they stole.

26:38.125 --> 26:39.875
But they got into
your control room,

26:39.877 --> 26:41.877
they looped the security footage,
and they gave themselves

26:41.879 --> 26:43.712
run of the place-- they
switched out the bales

26:43.714 --> 26:45.831
that were meant to
be shredded with fake currency.

26:45.833 --> 26:47.549
That doesn't make any sense.
If they got in,

26:47.551 --> 26:49.000
they could've taken
as much as they wanted.

26:49.002 --> 26:50.785
HOLMES: But not without
risking detection,

26:50.787 --> 26:53.388
inviting a massive manhunt.
If these bales

26:53.390 --> 26:55.357
had gone to the landfill
as you'd intended,

26:55.359 --> 26:56.925
no one would even know
there'd been a crime here.

26:56.927 --> 26:59.261
So we're not trying
to prevent a robbery;

26:59.263 --> 27:00.929
we're trying to
find these people

27:00.931 --> 27:04.149
before they disappear
with $33 million.

27:11.782 --> 27:14.389
WATSON: It's freezing out.
What are we looking at?

27:14.943 --> 27:15.930
HOLMES: Since she chose
the shed

27:15.955 --> 27:17.536
at the most remote
point of access to unlock.

27:17.537 --> 27:20.020
Look at this. See the
discoloration there?

27:20.022 --> 27:23.074
Rather than break down the door,
they've unscrewed the keypad,

27:23.076 --> 27:25.993
they wired in and then
reattached it on their way out.

27:25.995 --> 27:28.079
Left hardly a trace.

27:28.081 --> 27:30.030
We're standing
over a tunnel.

27:30.032 --> 27:31.549
Yeah.

27:31.551 --> 27:33.134
Without question,

27:33.136 --> 27:36.071
this was our point of ingress
and egress onto the property.

27:36.072 --> 27:38.100
Well, it looks like
someone's been smoking here.

27:38.141 --> 27:39.974
You think it's normally guarded?

27:39.976 --> 27:42.426
Huh. Unless a
massive storm

27:42.428 --> 27:45.045
forces them to work
with a skeleton crew.

27:45.047 --> 27:47.715
You have to admire
the ingenuity of the plan.

27:47.717 --> 27:49.350
If they hadn't killed someone,

27:49.352 --> 27:53.270
I'd have half a mind
to let them get away with it.

28:08.420 --> 28:12.339
They came out of EROC with
$33 million in small bills.

28:12.341 --> 28:14.241
They loaded their haul
into an ambulance--

28:14.243 --> 28:15.626
American-made in the late '90s.

28:15.628 --> 28:16.777
They haven't been gone

28:16.779 --> 28:18.879
more than an hour.

28:18.881 --> 28:21.427
WATSON: The driver had a lazy eye,
the other two met

28:21.428 --> 28:23.850
at basketball camp,
and one has canine lupus.

28:25.438 --> 28:27.221
You see how it feels?

28:27.223 --> 28:29.106
Just tell me how you know.

28:29.108 --> 28:31.525
Well... just...

28:33.111 --> 28:34.729
These tire tracks,

28:34.731 --> 28:37.264
they're varying axle bases.
The front wheels,

28:37.266 --> 28:38.532
little bit
closer together.

28:38.534 --> 28:40.067
That is a very
rare configuration.

28:40.069 --> 28:41.368
It's common only
in ambulances

28:41.370 --> 28:42.936
and certain U-Haul-
style box trucks.

28:42.938 --> 28:45.122
Now, if I was trying to
make my way unimpeded

28:45.124 --> 28:46.841
through a storm-locked
area, I'd rather be

28:46.843 --> 28:50.277
in an ambulance
than a U-Haul. Wouldn't you?

28:50.279 --> 28:53.047
Two inches of snow
are falling every hour.

28:53.049 --> 28:55.015
Those tracks would
be impossible to see,

28:55.017 --> 28:57.752
unless they were here within what,
the last 90 minutes or so?

28:57.754 --> 28:58.919
Very good, Watson.

28:58.921 --> 29:00.287
And given
the current conditions,

29:00.289 --> 29:03.140
it's not too late
to catch them.

29:03.925 --> 29:05.760
GREGSON:
Do you know we have

29:05.762 --> 29:08.979
a satellite phone linkup to
other law enforcement agencies?

29:08.981 --> 29:12.233
It's so we can stay in touch
in case of emergencies.

29:12.235 --> 29:15.903
BELL: Alysa Darvin, the name
you used at the hospital,

29:15.905 --> 29:17.822
it's an alias.
You dropped it before.

29:17.824 --> 29:19.607
Your real name
is Elle Bastin.

29:19.609 --> 29:21.242
You were born
in Marseilles.

29:21.244 --> 29:24.111
You got dual citizenship
with arrests for larceny

29:24.113 --> 29:26.614
in Germany and Portugal.

29:26.616 --> 29:31.652
Your husband, Ibn Casimir,
was in on both jobs.

29:31.654 --> 29:34.705
Is that why
you won't talk to us?

29:34.707 --> 29:36.757
'Cause you're married
to a guy who decided,

29:36.759 --> 29:39.093
go ahead with the robbery
after you got shot?

29:39.878 --> 29:41.545
GREGSON:
Elle...

29:41.547 --> 29:43.330
tell us what
he's up to,

29:43.332 --> 29:44.998
where we can find him.

29:45.000 --> 29:48.352
Otherwise, you're gonna
eat a murder charge alone.

29:49.838 --> 29:52.356
(French accent):
You will never find my husband.

29:52.358 --> 29:55.359
MAN:
Captain, sorry to interrupt.

29:55.361 --> 29:58.262
There's someone named Sherlock
Holmes on the radio for you.

29:58.264 --> 30:00.564
He says EROC's
already been robbed.

30:06.955 --> 30:08.706
(door closes)

30:08.708 --> 30:10.291
HOLMES:
<i>You found the murderess?</i>

30:10.293 --> 30:13.160
GREGSON: Yeah, the murderess
is name Elle Bastin.

30:13.162 --> 30:15.028
Detective Bell's
been talking to Interpol.

30:15.030 --> 30:17.197
They say she's got
four plane tickets

30:17.199 --> 30:20.868
booked out of BWI day after
tomorrow; headed to Belize.

30:20.870 --> 30:24.088
HOLMES: And on to a non-extradition
country from there, I assume.

30:24.090 --> 30:25.723
The good news is,

30:25.725 --> 30:26.925
if they're flying commercially

30:26.926 --> 30:28.709
they will have to unload
the money first.

30:28.711 --> 30:32.763
$33 million in cash takes up
enormous physical space.

30:32.765 --> 30:35.048
At the moment, they're carrying
it in the back of an ambulance.

30:35.050 --> 30:37.902
What was she carrying on her
when you arrested her?

30:37.904 --> 30:39.687
BELL:
Uh, not much.

30:39.689 --> 30:41.856
She had a burner on her
when I found her,

30:41.858 --> 30:43.574
but the texts
are limited right now.

30:43.576 --> 30:45.993
Only managed to pull the last
dozen numbers she dialed.

30:45.995 --> 30:47.945
You can use a reverse directory.

30:47.947 --> 30:50.114
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's not my first day, Holmes.

30:50.116 --> 30:52.783
I did. She mostly called
friends and family.

30:52.785 --> 30:55.402
There were a couple to
Oak Knoll out in Queens.

30:55.404 --> 30:57.588
Who did she call
at the racetrack?

30:57.590 --> 30:59.623
A guy named Joseph Leseur.

30:59.625 --> 31:01.792
He's the Director of
Thoroughbred Racing over there.

31:01.794 --> 31:03.911
Well, Detective,
what would you do if you had

31:03.913 --> 31:06.213
an enormous amount
of old, worn-out bills

31:06.215 --> 31:07.848
with old serial numbers?

31:07.850 --> 31:10.301
<i>I</i> would swap them out
with nice new clean ones,

31:10.303 --> 31:11.585
little bit at a time.

31:11.587 --> 31:13.587
Especially if I
had a contact who worked

31:13.589 --> 31:16.423
in one of the largest-volume
cash businesses there is.

31:16.425 --> 31:20.945
Tell me, can we get an address
for Mr. Leseur?

31:29.604 --> 31:31.038
Who's driving you around?

31:31.040 --> 31:32.239
Pam.

31:32.241 --> 31:34.275
So, what have
you learned?

31:34.277 --> 31:37.294
Well, none of the, uh, neighbors
spotted an ambulance

31:37.296 --> 31:39.713
driving up to Leseur's house.

31:39.715 --> 31:43.500
If they plan on coming here,
they haven't done it yet.

31:43.502 --> 31:48.005
Takes time to move $33 million
around a paralyzed city.

31:48.007 --> 31:49.807
Mm.

31:51.726 --> 31:53.811
Do you know where the term
"stakeout" comes from?

31:53.813 --> 31:55.763
No, but I'm guessing
I'm about to find out.

31:55.765 --> 31:58.732
DISPATCHER: All units, be advised that
a Stuyvesant Memorial ambulance

31:58.734 --> 32:01.018
just passed the road closure
and is driving east

32:01.020 --> 32:02.319
across the City Island Bridge.

32:02.321 --> 32:04.471
Copy that.
Let them through.

32:04.473 --> 32:07.691
We'll arrest everybody after
they pull up to Leseur's place.

32:07.693 --> 32:11.578
(vehicle approaching)

32:13.481 --> 32:15.916
BELL:
Hold it.

32:17.168 --> 32:19.620
Wait for the exchange.

32:23.875 --> 32:25.542
(rings doorbell)

32:25.544 --> 32:27.311
OFFICER: Detective,
I think one of the EMTs

32:27.313 --> 32:29.029
just clocked me.
I'm going in.

32:29.031 --> 32:32.716
(sirens wailing)

32:41.142 --> 32:44.311
OFFICER:
Get on the ground now!

32:44.313 --> 32:46.313
MAN: What the hell are
you guys doing?!

32:46.315 --> 32:48.365
Don't move. You're under arrest.
For what?!

32:48.367 --> 32:50.734
We got a nonemergency
call to this address.

32:50.736 --> 32:52.703
You telling me
you don't have $33 million

32:52.705 --> 32:54.154
in the back of that ambulance?

32:54.156 --> 32:55.656
What?!
Of course not!

33:08.486 --> 33:11.371
Stretcher,
medical supplies.

33:11.373 --> 33:14.658
Street value, maybe
a few thousand, but hey,

33:14.660 --> 33:16.927
it's not like we're busy
today or anything.

33:19.931 --> 33:21.732
I don't understand.

33:21.734 --> 33:23.567
We've been duped.

33:33.959 --> 33:35.859
HOLMES:
<i>It doesn't make any sense.</i>

33:35.860 --> 33:38.027
We were waiting for a Stuyvesant
Memorial ambulance,

33:38.029 --> 33:40.113
and even though there was
no emergency

33:40.115 --> 33:41.347
at Joseph Leseur's house,

33:41.349 --> 33:42.949
Stuyvesant Memorial
ambulance showed up.

33:42.951 --> 33:44.284
Now, that can't be
a coincidence.

33:44.286 --> 33:46.402
So, taking odds,
you think that

33:46.404 --> 33:49.038
Davis has shacked up
with Ms. Hudson or not?

33:49.040 --> 33:52.024
Uh, hey, listen.
This was pretty fun.

33:52.026 --> 33:54.244
If you ever need,
you know, a snowplow

33:54.246 --> 33:55.545
for hire again...

33:55.547 --> 33:57.964
give me a call.

34:00.317 --> 34:01.885
(sighs)

34:08.592 --> 34:10.560
(sighs)

34:10.562 --> 34:13.730
Oh, my God!

34:14.514 --> 34:16.232
It's spotless.

34:16.234 --> 34:17.400
HUDSON:
Don't hate me.

34:17.402 --> 34:19.385
Hate you?
I love you.

34:21.522 --> 34:22.772
How's it arranged?

34:22.774 --> 34:24.072
By subject matter,

34:24.074 --> 34:26.359
then by author.

34:26.360 --> 34:28.360
You start with
hard sciences

34:28.362 --> 34:30.746
on the north wall,
and then you move

34:30.748 --> 34:32.248
clockwise around the room

34:32.250 --> 34:35.900
in descending order
of academic rigor.

34:35.902 --> 34:38.504
That way,

34:38.505 --> 34:41.174
<i>Physics</i>
by Aristotle is as far away

34:41.176 --> 34:46.179
from <i>You Can Learn Telepathy</i> by
Morton Zuckerman as possible.

34:46.181 --> 34:47.597
That's reasonable.

34:47.599 --> 34:49.849
Oh, and I stacked
your monographs

34:49.851 --> 34:52.268
that you wrote on your desk.

34:52.270 --> 34:53.803
I liked the one

34:53.804 --> 34:55.388
about queen bees.

34:55.389 --> 34:57.223
(chuckles)

34:57.225 --> 34:59.475
WATSON:
I'm impressed.

34:59.477 --> 35:01.728
I have a touch of OCD.

35:01.730 --> 35:03.665
Seems to flare up
after a breakup.

35:03.690 --> 35:04.982
Davis?

35:04.983 --> 35:08.934
He stayed over
the first night, but...

35:08.936 --> 35:11.988
our thing wasn't
really healthy.

35:11.990 --> 35:13.456
Or happy.

35:13.458 --> 35:16.993
I think maybe I have to take
another look at that whole

35:16.995 --> 35:18.962
"kept woman" thing.

35:22.433 --> 35:25.134
Why does Clyde have tape
on his back?

35:25.136 --> 35:27.337
It's a cross.
He's an ambulance.

35:27.339 --> 35:29.005
He's <i>the</i> ambulance.

35:29.007 --> 35:30.223
Oh, I see.

35:30.225 --> 35:32.308
So, the locks are checkpoints
and road closures?

35:32.310 --> 35:34.761
Mm. According
to Captain Gregson,

35:34.763 --> 35:37.230
we have reason to believe
that Ibn Casimir

35:37.232 --> 35:41.184
and his compatriots
were... here

35:41.186 --> 35:42.652
at 3:00.

35:42.654 --> 35:44.103
That's when multiple
eyewitnesses report

35:44.105 --> 35:45.655
seeing a Stuyvesant
Memorial ambulance

35:45.657 --> 35:48.408
flagrantly disregarding
a severe traffic accident

35:48.410 --> 35:50.193
on Soundview Terrace.

35:50.195 --> 35:52.144
It's odd for an ambulance

35:52.146 --> 35:54.580
to ignore those
in distress.

35:54.582 --> 35:57.583
Less strange if it is carrying
$33 million in cash

35:57.585 --> 35:59.452
instead of
medical supplies.

35:59.454 --> 36:02.171
Let's presume the
thieves learned

36:02.173 --> 36:03.823
that we were looking
for them.

36:03.825 --> 36:06.009
They call in a
false distress signal

36:06.011 --> 36:07.510
to Joseph Leseur's house,

36:07.512 --> 36:11.330
and then they take their
stolen cargo elsewhere.

36:11.332 --> 36:13.800
It's hard to see where
they could have gone.

36:13.802 --> 36:16.502
I mean, every cop
was looking for them at that point.

36:16.504 --> 36:19.272
Mm, exactly.
And what's more,

36:19.274 --> 36:21.641
the streets were a maze of
emergency checkpoints.

36:21.643 --> 36:24.894
The whole city was
virtually locked down.

36:24.896 --> 36:28.231
I like what you did
with the-the locks and everything.

36:29.733 --> 36:31.984
I'm not trying
to create a visual pun.

36:31.986 --> 36:33.319
I'm trying to see how

36:33.321 --> 36:34.871
an ambulance could have got
anywhere,

36:34.873 --> 36:36.489
even a decent hiding place,

36:36.491 --> 36:38.858
when there was quite literally
nowhere for it to turn.

36:38.860 --> 36:41.577
It seems impossible. The only way
it could have gotten anywhere

36:41.579 --> 36:43.529
is if those checkpoints
and road closures weren't there.

36:43.531 --> 36:44.747
But they <i>were</i> there.

36:44.749 --> 36:46.532
You can't just
wish them away

36:46.534 --> 36:49.402
with a wave of your...
What?

36:49.404 --> 36:52.221
<i>Most</i> people can't just wish
them away

36:52.223 --> 36:54.724
with a wave of their hand.

36:57.061 --> 36:58.327
GREGSON:
So, the stapler's the ambulance?

36:58.329 --> 37:01.898
Yeah, It was was a tortoise
last night. Bear with me.

37:01.900 --> 37:05.435
These stickers represent
the checkpoints and closures.

37:05.437 --> 37:08.704
We know that the ambulance
driven by Ibn Casimir

37:08.706 --> 37:12.909
and his associates
was spotted here yesterday.

37:12.911 --> 37:15.495
We do not know how
it got out of the city.

37:15.497 --> 37:18.831
Ms. Watson has a copy of
yesterday's dispatch log.

37:18.833 --> 37:22.234
A commendable attempt to catalog
the blizzard's madness.

37:22.236 --> 37:25.738
Ms. Watson, would you please
read the events in question?

37:25.740 --> 37:28.091
Yes, of course. Um, at 3:32,

37:28.093 --> 37:30.626
a stretch of St. Ann's Avenue
was reopened

37:30.628 --> 37:32.261
when officers manning
a checkpoint

37:32.263 --> 37:33.763
were reassigned
to Garvey Park.

37:33.765 --> 37:37.583
3:45. Police officers
at the Triborough Bridge

37:37.585 --> 37:39.635
were directed to investigate
reports of a fire

37:39.637 --> 37:41.687
that turned out
to be false.

37:41.689 --> 37:44.724
At ten to 4:00, the checkpoint
at Astoria and 31st

37:44.726 --> 37:46.926
was deemed unnecessary
and shut down.

37:46.928 --> 37:48.945
Yes, now, see, there's more.
There's many, many more.

37:48.947 --> 37:50.613
But you, uh, you get the idea.

37:50.615 --> 37:54.066
A series of personnel maneuvers,
on their own, unremarkable,

37:54.068 --> 37:56.435
but you consider them
as a whole,

37:56.437 --> 37:59.271
they add up to quite a tidy
escape route out of New York.

37:59.273 --> 38:02.775
You think someone was playing
Moses, parting the Red Sea?

38:02.777 --> 38:07.163
If you're right, they've got
a high-level player inside.

38:07.165 --> 38:11.834
So how's it been,
working with Mrs. Castor?

38:11.836 --> 38:14.387
It's fine.
She's tough.

38:14.389 --> 38:15.621
Knows her job.

38:15.623 --> 38:17.423
Sharp enough to be
able to arrange

38:17.425 --> 38:20.810
the chessboard without
arousing suspicion.

38:20.812 --> 38:23.095
Do you know what

38:23.097 --> 38:26.599
a FEMA Emergency Response
Administrator is paid in salary?

38:26.601 --> 38:29.301
She's GS-13 on the
government pay scale.

38:29.303 --> 38:30.603
It is <i>not</i> exorbitant.

38:30.605 --> 38:32.071
I don't make a fortune either.

38:32.073 --> 38:33.806
You want to make
a citizen's arrest?

38:33.808 --> 38:37.126
I am merely suggesting a motive.
She is paid the same amount

38:37.128 --> 38:41.164
as the postmaster
of Sheboygan, Wisconsin.

38:41.166 --> 38:43.366
Perhaps she decided
she needed a raise.

38:43.368 --> 38:44.483
That's all very
interesting,

38:44.485 --> 38:45.985
but we don't
have a case.

38:45.987 --> 38:48.337
All I can point to
is the few instances

38:48.339 --> 38:49.589
of her doing her job.

38:49.591 --> 38:51.340
Now our thieves are gone,

38:51.342 --> 38:53.709
and the one we've
got isn't talking.

38:53.711 --> 38:56.295
Oh. Why do you
think Ms. Bastin

38:56.297 --> 38:58.014
has decided not
to bargain with us?

38:58.016 --> 39:01.217
I suppose it's possible in her
case there is honor among thieves.

39:01.219 --> 39:03.219
But it's also possible that
she's holding onto

39:03.221 --> 39:04.804
her most valuable
bargaining chip:

39:04.806 --> 39:07.390
the identity of a corrupt
government employee

39:07.392 --> 39:09.892
until she is quite certain
that her inside contact

39:09.894 --> 39:14.146
cannot facilitate her escape.

39:14.148 --> 39:17.016
I don't know about you,
I'm quite hoping her faith

39:17.018 --> 39:20.036
in that remote possibility
is redeemed.

39:27.828 --> 39:30.713
(sighs)

39:30.715 --> 39:34.133
Do you know what a Mass
Spectrometer is, Elle?

39:34.135 --> 39:37.253
Truth is, I don't really know
how the thing works myself,

39:37.255 --> 39:39.639
so I'm not the best person
to explain it, but I'll try.

39:39.641 --> 39:42.875
Here goes: a Mass Spectrometer
is the thing

39:42.877 --> 39:44.477
that just ruined your life.

39:44.479 --> 39:47.563
The GSR test came back.

39:47.565 --> 39:51.100
You had gunshot residue
all over your right palm.

39:51.102 --> 39:53.319
You're going down for
the murder of Frank Dempster.

39:53.321 --> 39:55.738
We're gonna put you away
for life.

39:58.075 --> 40:03.162
Guess the backup generator
wasn't built for the long haul.

40:03.164 --> 40:05.998
Oh, right, I was talking about
how they're clearing the roads

40:06.000 --> 40:08.451
and you're about to be transferred
to Central Booking.

40:08.453 --> 40:11.420
(men shouting indistinctly)

40:11.422 --> 40:13.339
What's going on?

40:14.875 --> 40:16.459
Somebody got stabbed
in the holding cells

40:16.461 --> 40:18.410
during the blackout. Come on.
You, too. Let's go.

40:18.412 --> 40:20.796
Shouldn't somebody
keep an eye on her?

40:20.798 --> 40:23.349
Come on. The door's gonna lock
from the outside.

40:23.351 --> 40:25.101
Ms. Bastin's not going anywhere.

40:26.803 --> 40:29.855
Detective Bell once confided
he played Sky Masterson

40:29.857 --> 40:32.775
in his high school
production

40:32.777 --> 40:34.426
of <i>Guys and Dolls.</i>

40:34.428 --> 40:38.030
I had not, until this moment,
imagined that he was any good.

40:38.032 --> 40:42.785
The stage's loss is New York
City's gain, I suppose.

40:42.787 --> 40:44.704
GREGSON (on radio):
How we looking, Holmes?

40:44.706 --> 40:47.657
Nothing yet.

40:47.659 --> 40:48.941
How's the riot?

40:48.943 --> 40:50.910
(officers shouting)

41:10.647 --> 41:13.399
Not a word.
Follow me.

41:13.401 --> 41:15.267
Here we go.

41:17.020 --> 41:20.656
The happy collaborators
are on their way out, Captain.

41:20.658 --> 41:22.992
Okay.

41:22.994 --> 41:24.327
Wait, wait.

41:24.329 --> 41:25.611
We can't charge them
with escape

41:25.613 --> 41:26.996
until they clear
the floor.

41:26.998 --> 41:29.165
(shouting continues)

41:34.955 --> 41:38.424
You didn't say anything
to them, did you?

41:38.426 --> 41:40.710
Say anything about what?

41:42.796 --> 41:45.348
♪

41:54.775 --> 41:57.526
Hey, Gregson
just called.

41:57.528 --> 41:59.061
Denise Castor turned
on her partners.

41:59.063 --> 42:00.446
Turns out the ambulance

42:00.448 --> 42:02.417
and the cash were in a
garage in Rockaway.

42:02.442 --> 42:03.233
Wonderful.

42:03.234 --> 42:05.701
Oh, redecorating
already?

42:05.703 --> 42:09.121
(horn honking)

42:10.741 --> 42:12.074
Uh, what's Pam doing here?

42:12.076 --> 42:14.126
Ms. Hudson needs a ride
to her cousin's.

42:14.128 --> 42:16.295
Some of the roads
still a bit dicey.

42:16.297 --> 42:18.130
That's me.

42:18.132 --> 42:19.382
Thank you.

42:19.384 --> 42:20.800
I'll see you Tuesday.

42:22.135 --> 42:23.469
What's Tuesday?

42:23.471 --> 42:26.038
Ms. Hudson needs some cash
while she figures out

42:26.040 --> 42:27.339
her next move.
I've engaged her

42:27.341 --> 42:29.041
to clean the place on
a weekly basis.

42:29.043 --> 42:30.426
Oh.

42:33.013 --> 42:34.930
That's very considerate.

42:34.932 --> 42:36.899
I wasn't going to do
it myself, was I?

42:36.901 --> 42:38.234
And you've decided
to take on

42:38.236 --> 42:39.735
some extra casework
to cover her fees.

42:39.737 --> 42:42.238
Excuse me.
We never agreed to that.

42:42.240 --> 42:43.739
Well, 50-50, then.

42:44.991 --> 42:48.227
Now, come back in ten minutes,
wear a blindfold.

42:48.229 --> 42:49.728
The bloodstains will
be ready,

42:49.730 --> 42:51.630
and the lesson can begin.
