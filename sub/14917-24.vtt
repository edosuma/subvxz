Spiritual?

01:28.590 --> 01:32.690
Let's put aside the evan visitation issue
and try and resolve where you plan to live.

01:33.320 --> 01:34.740
I plan to live here,in our house.

01:34.750 --> 01:36.320
I want to be in pasadena.

01:37.720 --> 01:38.980
Okay,it's not a game of chicken.

01:38.990 --> 01:40.350
I want to be near my family.

01:40.360 --> 01:42.260
Then live here with your family.

01:42.300 --> 01:45.290
We're stuck,and I truly believe that if we spend some time apart,

01:45.300 --> 01:47.050
if we're meant to be,we'll find each other again.

01:47.060 --> 01:48.690
You know where to find me. I'm right here.

01:48.710 --> 01:51.950
Well,I'm not gonna live here just for appearances so you can go run for governor.

01:51.960 --> 01:53.320
And I'm not gonna turn my life upside down

01:53.330 --> 01:56.340
because you have some cockamamy idea that by separating,it's gonna help our marriage.

01:56.350 --> 01:57.460
"Cockamamy's" not productive.

01:57.470 --> 01:59.310
No,it's not productive.You know what's productive?

01:59.320 --> 02:00.190
Couples' therapy.

02:00.200 --> 02:01.900
No. No,I'm not gonna do that right now.

02:01.910 --> 02:04.030
Well,I'm not gonna make any more concessions until you agree to go.

02:04.040 --> 02:05.350
You haven't made one concession.

02:05.360 --> 02:08.780
Oh,my whole marriage to you has been me making concessions for your career

02:08.789 --> 02:09.740
and for your campaign and-- And for--

02:09.750 --> 02:12.070
And what about your flirtation with diaper man in the park?

02:12.080 --> 02:13.060
I made a concession there,didn't I?

02:13.070 --> 02:15.690
You know what? After an hour with you two,I want therapy.

02:15.700 --> 02:18.320
It's actually been an hour and ten minutes. I have to go.

02:18.410 --> 02:20.400
Oh,no,no,priceless.

02:20.650 --> 02:23.030
You asked for an hour.I've got three meetings back-To-back,

02:23.040 --> 02:25.370
and I haven't even looked at the speech I have to give in d.C. Tomorrow.

02:25.380 --> 02:28.030
Oh,I'm sorry,robert.Are we interrupting your schedule?

02:28.040 --> 02:30.240
We don't have to solve this right now.It's not a divorce settlement.

02:30.250 --> 02:32.280
Right.Kevin,I'll see you at the office.

02:36.800 --> 02:39.500
I mean,seriously,he couldn't change one of his meetings?

02:40.200 --> 02:41.520
I'm sorry.I'm switzerland,

02:41.540 --> 02:45.930
but by the way,the geneva convention was written outlawing torture.

02:47.830 --> 02:49.660
I'm sorry.I know this is hard for you.

02:50.510 --> 02:52.630
Yeah. Yeah,it is.

02:52.670 --> 02:56.370
And can you please not make it any harder by telling everybody?

02:56.490 --> 02:58.050
They won't hear a word from me.

03:03.820 --> 03:06.690
Hey,I'm sorry I'm late.I just got off the phone with the lawyers.

03:06.710 --> 03:08.450
- And?
- Well,they're pretty confident

03:08.460 --> 03:14.250
that we can get around the bylaws as far as ryan is concerned,but we have to move quickly.

03:14.430 --> 03:18.410
The longer he performs according to his job description,The trickier it is to fire him.

03:18.420 --> 03:22.590
I'm just not sure that kicking ryan to the curb is the answer anymore.

03:23.100 --> 03:25.660
Yeah,but,uh,we already agreed on that.

03:25.670 --> 03:28.730
I know. I'm rethinking.

03:29.450 --> 03:33.450
This is a kid who isconvinced that his mother committed suicide

03:33.460 --> 03:37.090
and that william walker is responsible for that decision.

03:37.520 --> 03:41.410
You want him nursing that kind of grudge with ojai shares in h pocket?

03:41.420 --> 03:44.210
No,I don't want him nursing any kind of grudge,

03:44.250 --> 03:46.670
which is why I've worked up a severance package.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.990
He's worked here for less than a month.

03:53.760 --> 03:57.870
Okay.I was imagining maybe two months wages.

03:57.900 --> 04:01.510
This is a golden parachute. He's not a c.E.O.

04:01.660 --> 04:02.380
No.

04:04.270 --> 04:05.640
But he is my father's son.

04:05.660 --> 04:09.500
And this is no longer a family business.

04:09.530 --> 04:12.700
This is your business and my business.

04:12.820 --> 04:16.329
And we have an obligation to be fiscally responsible.

04:16.339 --> 04:20.050
This company is about more than the bottom line,holly.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.620
It always has been.

04:21.640 --> 04:25.260
Now I can't pretend that he's like any other employee because he's not.

04:25.290 --> 04:26.390
He is family.

04:26.400 --> 04:31.400
You sound exactly like tommy When we started working together.

04:31.670 --> 04:35.590
Well,like it or not,holly,my brother and I Were raised to do business a certain way.

04:36.640 --> 04:39.350
For a long time,that worked.

04:41.870 --> 04:45.690
Fine. Do it your way. Offer him the package.

04:45.700 --> 04:47.090
But do it soon.

04:55.980 --> 04:56.940
Excuse me.

04:56.960 --> 05:01.300
Uh,is there a way to get in?I don't seem to be able to find the entrance.

05:02.740 --> 05:03.750
Thank you.

05:15.460 --> 05:16.460
Hello.

05:18.120 --> 05:20.100
Hello. Hello. Oh.

05:20.610 --> 05:22.010
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

05:22.040 --> 05:25.500
Um,I-I'm looking for tommy walker.Is he staying here?

05:25.510 --> 05:26.520
Thomas? Yes.

05:26.530 --> 05:28.870
Oh,thank god. Could I see him?

05:29.240 --> 05:34.270
Um,I'm sorry,but,uh,he didn't mention that he was expecting a guest.

05:34.290 --> 05:35.020
Well,that's the problem.

05:35.030 --> 05:38.730
I didn't know where he was,and I was unable to contact him.I...

05:39.180 --> 05:40.810
I don't even know if he'll want to see me.

05:40.830 --> 05:42.280
We had a terrible fight.

05:42.290 --> 05:44.530
- You're his mother.
- Yes,I'm his mother.

05:44.750 --> 05:48.630
As soon as I found out where he was,I got on the first flight that I could from los angeles.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.600
Oh,he's off-Site right now.

05:50.660 --> 05:51.310
He's off-Site?

05:51.330 --> 05:53.390
He's working at another location.

05:55.160 --> 05:56.420
He's working here?

05:56.450 --> 05:59.250
Everyone who stays here is required to work.

06:01.010 --> 06:04.900
Oh... well,could you call him,please,And tell him his mother is here to see him?

06:04.910 --> 06:06.510
There's no way to reach him.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.440
We-- We don't allow the use of cell phones.

06:10.940 --> 06:12.860
Well,just tell me where he is,And I'll go to him.

06:12.890 --> 06:15.050
I'm sorry. I cannoto that.

06:16.920 --> 06:21.070
Look,I haven't seen him Or talked to him in almost two months.Please,please--

06:21.080 --> 06:24.810
I understand that you're eager to see your son,yes.

06:24.860 --> 06:27.810
So you are welcome to stay and wait.

06:38.750 --> 06:40.390
Sarah,I need your help.

06:40.420 --> 06:41.120
Mom.

06:41.130 --> 06:42.350
Tommy's in trouble.

06:42.370 --> 06:45.170
Mom,this is a terrible connection.Speak up.

06:45.210 --> 06:46.700
That's because I'm in mexico.

06:46.710 --> 06:49.860
You're in mexico? What are you doing in mexico?

06:49.870 --> 06:51.320
I found tommy.

06:52.450 --> 06:53.870
I- I-Is he okay?

06:53.910 --> 06:55.830
I don't know. They won't let me see him.

06:55.850 --> 06:57.630
- Who won't?
- The people he...

07:01.110 --> 07:02.240
The people here.

07:02.320 --> 07:04.040
I think he's mixed up in some kind of cult.

07:04.050 --> 07:04.850
A cult?

07:04.860 --> 07:07.970
A cult. That's why he couldn't call us.They wouldn't let him.

07:07.980 --> 07:13.190
Mom,just-- Just--Just calm down and,um,just tell me exactly where you are.

07:13.210 --> 07:15.670
I can't.I gotta go. Talk to robert. He knows where I am.

07:15.705 --> 07:17.560
No,no,no. Mom,mom.Wait,wait,wait,w--

07:18.760 --> 07:19.400

07:32.330 --> 07:36.020
No,no,I just had this absolutely hysterical call from mom about jonestown

07:36.030 --> 07:37.730
and how he's in some kind of compound.

07:37.740 --> 07:41.000
Sarah,slow down. She used the actual word "cult"?

07:41.150 --> 07:41.760
Cult?

07:41.770 --> 07:45.310
Yes,lots of weird people,mexicoin a cult.

07:45.320 --> 07:48.320
Robert says that there's nothing to indicate that that's what this place is.

07:48.330 --> 07:50.790
Unless it's a cult for screwups.Then he could become their prophet.

07:50.800 --> 07:52.970
Whatever it is,they won't let mom see him.

07:52.980 --> 07:56.780
Seriously,I just can't believe that tommy would get himself involved in something like that.

07:56.790 --> 07:58.780
You didn't see him in baja. He was an emotional wreck.

07:58.790 --> 08:00.690
Yeah,and that's when they get you--When you're weak and vulnerable.

08:00.700 --> 08:04.010
He wasn't vulnerable.He got into a fistfight with a bunch of drunken frat boys.

08:04.020 --> 08:05.560
Well,see,this is what I'm talking about.

08:05.570 --> 08:07.940
Is he in a peaceful,blissed-Out,panhandling cult?

08:07.950 --> 08:10.840
Or is in an angry,heavily-Armed,kool-Aid cult?

08:10.850 --> 08:12.630
He is not in a cult.

08:12.640 --> 08:14.250
Okay,let's just take that off the table.

08:14.260 --> 08:16.290
The point is,mom is still down there alone.

08:16.300 --> 08:19.590
If she's down there freaked out about tommy,This could be a whole international incident.

08:19.600 --> 08:20.890
Okay,let me know if it becomes one.

08:20.900 --> 08:23.000
Kevin,I really think he needs us right now.

08:23.010 --> 08:26.740
The last thing tommy wants is for this family To turn up and rescue him,okay?

08:26.750 --> 08:29.280
I have rescued him many times. He will not thank you for it.

08:29.290 --> 08:30.940
We're not looking for his thanks.

08:30.950 --> 08:32.620
We just want to help mom get him out of there.

08:32.630 --> 08:33.690
Fine. Good luck with that.

08:33.710 --> 08:34.460
Kevin,wait--

08:34.480 --> 08:37.650
Ke-- It's all right. I'll get on the phone with the airline.

08:37.659 --> 08:40.350
I'll let you know the flight number,okay?We can handle this without him.

08:40.360 --> 08:44.039
Well,that's if mom's not in some mexican jail because she went savage on some,

08:44.070 --> 08:46.470
you know,Brainwashed zombie that's keeping her from tommy.

08:46.480 --> 08:50.690
Justin,the situation is bad enough,okay?Don't go blowing it all out of proportion.

08:50.710 --> 08:53.910
Guys,this is mom we're talking about,And someone's messing with one of her kids.

08:53.930 --> 08:56.820
By my calculations,we lost contact with mom over an hour ago,

08:56.830 --> 08:58.930
which means every minute we're on this phone call,

08:59.000 --> 09:01.440
She could be heading up a river into the heart of darkness.

09:12.430 --> 09:13.370
Excuse me.

09:13.450 --> 09:17.680
Uh,excuse me,sir.They told me tommy works here,but I don't see him.

09:19.340 --> 09:20.600
Do you know him?

09:23.300 --> 09:24.600
Okay,thank you.

09:25.460 --> 09:27.900
Oh,oh,no.Um...

09:28.490 --> 09:30.000
Excuse me. Excuse me,sir.

09:30.010 --> 09:31.250
- I'm looking for--
- *****

09:31.370 --> 09:33.650
No,I'm-- I'm looking for my son.Thomas walker.

09:33.690 --> 09:34.960
Thomas walker.

09:35.400 --> 09:36.640
- Thomas?
- Yes.

09:38.600 --> 09:41.140
- This is thomas.
- What?

09:41.190 --> 09:44.780
Uh... this... is... thomas.

09:44.800 --> 09:47.200
What,this dirt is thomas? How can this dirt be th--

09:47.210 --> 09:49.530
Hold on one second! Hold on one second!Don't move a muscle.

09:49.540 --> 09:52.180
Now I don't know what's going on here Or what you've done with my son,

09:52.190 --> 09:56.710
But I want some answers real quick,because I have a group of very important people on their way here,

09:56.720 --> 09:59.770
including a very influential,very powerful attorney,

09:59.790 --> 10:01.660
And if you have done anything with my son--

10:01.700 --> 10:02.400
Thomas walker.

10:02.410 --> 10:06.160
Why is it that everyone knows his name,And no one can tell me where he is?

10:06.180 --> 10:07.400
Hey,he went to merida.

10:07.560 --> 10:08.350
Merida?

10:08.440 --> 10:09.750
Yeah,to pick up some equipment.

10:09.770 --> 10:11.410
He is not gonna be back till tomorrow.

10:13.420 --> 10:16.060
Well,wh-Why did they tell me this dirt was my son?

10:16.070 --> 10:17.690
This is his project.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.030
The fountain in the town has water problems.

10:20.050 --> 10:24.050
When tommy heard,He drew plans to dig up the old pipes and put in the new ones.

10:24.490 --> 10:27.100
You mean he's... free to leave whenever?

10:27.110 --> 10:28.750
He's not being held prisoner?

10:28.770 --> 10:29.990
Ah,senora.

10:30.270 --> 10:33.200
I think we need-- I think we need to talk,okay?

10:34.160 --> 10:37.230
Yeah. Good. Talk is good.

10:42.330 --> 10:43.010
So you're not gonna go?

10:43.020 --> 10:44.440
No,it's our anniversary.

10:44.460 --> 10:45.920
That's not an excuse. Kevin--

10:45.940 --> 10:48.980
Kevin,you don't celebrate something that's working When you're being asked to help something that's not.

10:48.990 --> 10:50.920
I'm sorry,but he's crossed the line.

10:50.930 --> 10:52.080
It's your line,kevin. Move it.

10:52.090 --> 10:53.720
I have,many times.

10:54.000 --> 10:54.820
Which one now?

10:55.560 --> 10:56.450
That would be sarah.

10:58.650 --> 10:59.770
You know what? It's not just me.

10:59.780 --> 11:02.490
This whole family keeps moving the line. You know why?

11:02.500 --> 11:04.390
'Cause we forgive him and we clean up his mess.

11:04.400 --> 11:05.300
We forgive,clean up,forgive,clean--

11:05.310 --> 11:06.260
I get-- I get it. I get it.

11:06.270 --> 11:09.680
You know,in high school,When he couldn't write his own essays,Kitty wrote them for him.

11:09.710 --> 11:11.740
When dad found pot in his car,who took the rap?

11:11.760 --> 11:12.410
You.

11:12.650 --> 11:15.190
No,justin. When he screwed up at ojai,Sarah had his back.

11:15.200 --> 11:17.320
He committed fraud,for god sake.

11:17.340 --> 11:18.870
Holly let him off the hook.

11:22.410 --> 11:24.250
Kitty? No.

11:25.130 --> 11:26.430
You know why he gets away with it?

11:26.560 --> 11:29.410
'Cause no one wants his wife and kid to leave him,No one wants his job to fall apart,

11:29.420 --> 11:31.710
No one wants him to end up in mexico with nothing to come back to.

11:31.720 --> 11:33.310
Guess what. It happened.

11:33.320 --> 11:35.700
Now mom's down there thinking she can save him.

11:36.140 --> 11:37.900
Until when,what,the next time?

11:38.030 --> 11:40.110
Don't you get it? He isnevergonna change.

11:40.140 --> 11:41.430
Well,what if you did?

11:42.120 --> 11:42.830
I'm trying to.

11:42.850 --> 11:44.450
By what,cutting off your family?

11:44.460 --> 11:47.770
Kevin,I know you. You're gonna sit across from me at some fancy restaurant,

11:47.780 --> 11:50.300
And all you're gonna be thinking about is if your family's okay.

11:50.400 --> 11:53.800
Kevin,I will be here when you get back.

11:54.360 --> 11:56.140
That's what we're celebrating,right?

12:09.250 --> 12:10.120
What airline?

12:11.050 --> 12:13.610
Oh,thanks for coming over on such short notice.

12:13.620 --> 12:16.220
No problem. Tell me about tommy.Have you heard anything?

12:16.360 --> 12:20.540
No,but we'll be there in the morning,so I guess we'll have more news soon.

12:20.560 --> 12:23.380
I can still go.You know,I'm very good at keeping your mother calm.

12:23.410 --> 12:24.540
I know you are.

12:25.120 --> 12:28.270
Listen,saul,there's something I need you to take care of here.

12:28.410 --> 12:30.300
Look,holly wants to fire ryan.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.640
So? What does that have to do with me?

12:36.570 --> 12:38.260
It's a severance package.

12:40.330 --> 12:41.810
- Sarah--
- I know it's generous.

12:41.820 --> 12:44.420
I don't want ryan to have to worry about money for a while.

12:45.340 --> 12:46.710
Would you take it to him?

12:48.830 --> 12:52.050
Look,I would do it myself,it's just that the lawyers are pressuring us

12:52.060 --> 12:53.850
to move on this immediately,so--

12:53.860 --> 12:56.740
I'm sorry,sweetheart.I just don't feel comfortable getting involved.

12:56.750 --> 13:00.400
Listen,saul,I know that ojai doesn't feel like our company anymore,

13:00.410 --> 13:01.890
And I-- I'm gonna change that.

13:01.900 --> 13:05.070
I want to bring tommy home,I want to put this family and this company back together,

13:05.080 --> 13:06.940
Because one doesn't work without the other.

13:08.880 --> 13:11.340
And tommy-- For all his bad decisions--

13:13.550 --> 13:15.760
Please,would you-- Would you just take it to him?

13:17.370 --> 13:18.380
Okay.

13:23.550 --> 13:24.950
Maybe we should just wait till I get back.

13:24.960 --> 13:27.190
Are you kidding me?I already told them that we have big news.

13:27.200 --> 13:29.130
If we don't tell them now,they'll freak out.

13:29.380 --> 13:30.330
Okay,all right.

13:30.390 --> 13:32.350
You're so cute when you're nervous.

13:32.380 --> 13:34.970
Ooh,you're so cute when you're nervous.

13:35.020 --> 13:36.280
David,come on,come on.

13:36.290 --> 13:37.490
Yeah,I'm-- I'm right here.

13:38.170 --> 13:39.700
So what's the news?

13:39.710 --> 13:41.320
Well,mom and dad...

13:42.420 --> 13:44.940
Justin and I wanted you to be the first to know--

13:45.130 --> 13:47.890
Um,we're getting married.

13:50.320 --> 13:54.010
Um... well,I guess congratulations is in order.

13:54.020 --> 13:54.750
Thank you.

13:58.930 --> 14:00.260
Mom,say something.

14:00.950 --> 14:03.160
Uh,it-- It's just a lot toake in.

14:03.190 --> 14:04.580
I know. It's-- It's crazy.

14:04.590 --> 14:05.770
Holly,I know it seems fast--

14:05.780 --> 14:07.840
No,no,it is fast.

14:08.160 --> 14:09.340
Are you pregnant?

14:10.230 --> 14:11.220
Mom,no.

14:11.540 --> 14:12.780
Then what's the rush?

14:12.800 --> 14:13.490
Oh,holly,they're just--

14:13.500 --> 14:15.290
No,no,that's a legitimate question.

14:15.300 --> 14:17.890
No,it's not. Justin and I are in love.

14:17.920 --> 14:19.680
Just be happy for us.

14:19.890 --> 14:24.790
Rebecca,you know that I want to be happy for you,But marriage is a big step.

14:25.110 --> 14:26.620
We-- We know it's a big step.

14:26.630 --> 14:28.520
And,you know,it's one that we're ready to take.

14:28.530 --> 14:29.780
And tell them why.

14:31.050 --> 14:32.390
Justin got in to medical school.

14:32.400 --> 14:33.270
You got in to medical school?

14:33.280 --> 14:34.450
- That's wonderful.
- Justin,that's fantastic.

14:34.460 --> 14:36.730
Justin,truly,truly.

14:36.990 --> 14:40.710
But,um,you guys just got back together again.

14:41.700 --> 14:43.950
Rebecca,isn't that a little impulsive?

14:46.950 --> 14:50.430
Oh,my god.Don't ruin this for me.

14:50.440 --> 14:52.230
Rebecca,rebecca,they're just trying to process it,okay?

14:52.240 --> 14:55.330
Process what?Mom,seriously,is this-- Is this because justin's a walker?

14:55.340 --> 14:57.770
Rebecca,you know why I'm worried.

14:58.060 --> 14:59.570
All right,everybody slow down.

14:59.610 --> 15:01.270
Just-- We just need a little bit of time,that's--

15:01.290 --> 15:02.290
Justin,let's go.

15:02.300 --> 15:03.680
Oh,rebecca.

15:07.650 --> 15:12.220
Look,I know we've been through a lot,but... I love your daughter.

15:12.420 --> 15:14.200
And I'm gonna be a good husband to her.

15:21.910 --> 15:22.700
Holly,wait a minute.

15:22.710 --> 15:24.340
What-- What-- What was that about?

15:24.360 --> 15:26.040
Is she right? Is this because he's a walker?

15:26.050 --> 15:27.260
No,it's not.

15:27.270 --> 15:30.230
So what is it then? Because she seems really happy.

15:30.790 --> 15:34.820
David,I-I know her a lot better than you do.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.800
You're sure the guy at the cantina called the right place?

15:41.810 --> 15:45.320
I was standing right there.Admittedly,he was speaking spanish.

15:45.330 --> 15:47.860
All right,let's talk public appearances.How's five a month?

15:47.870 --> 15:50.130
Kevin,please,can you just give it a rest?

15:50.140 --> 15:51.490
I think he'd be okay with three

15:51.500 --> 15:52.590
If you'd like to respond to that.

15:52.610 --> 15:55.590
Is that the only reason you can down here--Just to keep on haggling with me?

15:55.610 --> 15:57.530
No,I just think,make the best of a bad situation.

15:57.540 --> 16:00.950
We are here to focus on tommy,not this.

16:01.070 --> 16:02.600
Why do you think you can help him?

16:02.610 --> 16:03.540
- Well...
- Seriously.

16:03.550 --> 16:07.170
I think everyone can be helped. Just-- Just ask justin.

16:08.260 --> 16:11.770
I'm just saying that peoplecanturn theilives around,right?

16:12.070 --> 16:13.940
Right.Yeah,but this could be bad,I mean,if they--

16:13.970 --> 16:16.030
If they have control of his mind,guys--

16:16.040 --> 16:17.770
You know what? You've read enough. Hand that back.

16:17.780 --> 16:18.460
- No way.
- Give it back.

16:18.470 --> 16:19.760
Listen,you were the one that brought the picture.

16:19.770 --> 16:20.440
Why don't you tell 'em about that?

16:20.800 --> 16:21.460
What picture?

16:21.470 --> 16:26.540
They suggest that you should bring a photo Of your missing loved one with their family.

16:26.550 --> 16:28.910
It just-- It reminds them who they were.

16:28.920 --> 16:31.850
Yeah,if he doesn't know who we are,He could be a completely different person.

16:31.860 --> 16:33.270
Well,I'll keep my fingers crossed.

16:33.280 --> 16:34.120
Oh,kevin.

16:34.140 --> 16:35.020
You wanna know how they do it?

16:35.030 --> 16:37.940
They get you isolated in some remote area,

16:37.980 --> 16:42.020
Cut you off from society,And then it's easy for them to bend your will.

16:42.040 --> 16:43.840
They can get you to agree to anything.

16:43.860 --> 16:44.600
Oh,god.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.590
This is scary stuff. Kevin,wait,you gotta hear this.

16:46.600 --> 16:48.250
I've got it. "Bent will," great.

16:49.620 --> 16:53.660
Robert,it's me. Look,I think it would be A really good idea for you to come down here.

16:53.670 --> 16:58.530
Sources say at least one-Third of deprogrammers fail,and there are no statistics.

17:03.550 --> 17:04.589
Oh,my god.They got her,too.

17:04.609 --> 17:06.060
Where did she get a truck?

17:07.460 --> 17:09.010
How was your flight?!

17:09.050 --> 17:10.670
Did you find tommy?!

17:12.910 --> 17:14.609
Tell us about the cult!

17:16.740 --> 17:20.010
I... I may-- I may have overreacted just a little.

17:20.329 --> 17:21.180
You overre--

17:25.619 --> 17:26.569
You got a second,ryan?

17:29.600 --> 17:33.840
Look,I know that you understand that your situation here at ojai has become untenable,

17:33.850 --> 17:36.520
But we want to do everything we can to make it easy for you.

17:37.350 --> 17:38.860
Why'd they send you? You don't even work here.

17:39.870 --> 17:41.140
Oh,I used to work here.

17:41.650 --> 17:44.170
As a matter of fact,I helped build this company.Take a look at that.

17:51.320 --> 17:52.940
They really want to get rid of me,huh?

17:56.060 --> 17:59.300
Is that the way william did it,Just write her a big check and hope that's the end of it?

18:00.690 --> 18:04.090
Whatever william did,ryan,That was a long time ago.

18:05.090 --> 18:08.330
I'm sorry you found out about it.It must be very hard for you.

18:09.330 --> 18:12.390
Just understand that this is your money.It's for your future.

18:12.930 --> 18:14.510
So think about your future.

18:14.850 --> 18:16.400
Don't think about your past.

18:22.570 --> 18:23.940
What would you do if you were me?

18:25.940 --> 18:27.050
Would you sign this?

18:30.190 --> 18:32.050
It's like a spiritual retreat.

18:32.060 --> 18:33.990
They meditate and they do yoga,

18:34.000 --> 18:37.890
And,um,before every meal,they hit this big gong,

18:37.900 --> 18:40.130
And everybody eats in complete silence.

18:40.150 --> 18:40.760
No way.

18:40.770 --> 18:42.450
Yeah.I was working out at the dig site--

18:42.460 --> 18:44.820
Wait,wait,wait a minute. You were-- You were working?

18:44.830 --> 18:47.800
Everybody works here. It's called selfless service.

18:48.150 --> 18:49.000
I don't like it.

18:49.230 --> 18:50.790
What's this got to do with tommy anyway?

18:50.800 --> 18:53.640
You remember that-- That little fountain in the middle of town when you drove in?

18:53.650 --> 18:54.590
Well,it doesn't work.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.410
There's an inadequate water supply or something.

18:56.420 --> 18:58.300
That's tommy's idea-- How to fix it.

18:58.310 --> 19:01.810
It's his whole project,and I was talking to pablo,And he said that may--

19:01.820 --> 19:04.400
Mom,we don't care about pablo.

19:04.940 --> 19:05.550
No?

19:06.020 --> 19:07.890
Why haven't you seen tommy?

19:07.910 --> 19:12.140
He's picking up supplies somewhere,And he's supposed to be back by lunch.

19:12.150 --> 19:15.970
Okay,okay,okay.Did pablo tell you why tommy was here?

19:17.420 --> 19:20.240
No,but... isn't it obvious?

19:20.350 --> 19:22.340
No,not to me,no.

19:22.600 --> 19:23.550
Us.

19:24.270 --> 19:25.730
Wait,you're-- You're blaming us?

19:25.750 --> 19:28.870
- All right,fine,me.
- Oh,mom.

19:28.890 --> 19:33.100
I shamed him... in front of everyone.I... I hit him.

19:33.110 --> 19:35.040
Oh,you didn't hit him,okay? You slapped him.

19:35.050 --> 19:36.010
But there's a very big difference.

19:36.020 --> 19:38.820
I hit him,and I'm sure he doesn't feel like there's a difference.

19:38.850 --> 19:41.070
Well,if we're gonna talk about who's responsible,

19:41.090 --> 19:43.160
I'm the one that left him ale at ojai.

19:43.210 --> 19:47.420
And I know what that's like now,with holly making you feel like your family isn't important.

19:47.430 --> 19:48.970
Okay,the question is not why he's here.

19:48.980 --> 19:52.200
The question is,how are we gonna bring him back?

19:52.220 --> 19:53.320
Well,how do we?

19:53.550 --> 19:57.840
We just tell him that when he comes back,We will support him unconditionally.

19:57.850 --> 19:59.710
- Yeah,I agree.
- You're right. That's what we have to do.

19:59.720 --> 20:01.410
Thank you for being here.

20:01.420 --> 20:03.320
Okay,that's what we're gonna do.

20:04.290 --> 20:05.690
One of us needs to talk to kevin.

20:05.720 --> 20:06.790
Mom,you should do it.

20:06.810 --> 20:08.050
- You talk to kevin,kitty.
- No,you do it,mom.

20:08.070 --> 20:08.940
*****

20:08.950 --> 20:10.220
- *******
- *****

20:10.230 --> 20:13.060
Just because tommy's not in a cult doesn't mean he doesn't need our help.

20:13.080 --> 20:15.320
What are we supposed to do,rescue him from meditation?

20:15.350 --> 20:18.290
All right,let's face it-- Tommy can't do anything without you being pissed off at him.

20:18.300 --> 20:19.300
Sure he could.

20:19.320 --> 20:22.310
He couldace up to his responsibilities. I'm serious.

20:22.340 --> 20:25.930
He left his wife and child so he could sit In the middle of the jungle singing "kumbaya"?

20:26.320 --> 20:28.460
Come on.Look at this place.Does it even have a bathroom?

20:28.490 --> 20:30.640
Yeah,it does.It's down the hall.It's communal,though.

20:30.650 --> 20:31.450
Perfect.

20:32.170 --> 20:33.320
Sorry,sorry,sorry.

20:35.530 --> 20:36.590
This is the men's dorm.

20:36.980 --> 20:38.850
There's a woman out there.She almost caught me.

20:40.210 --> 20:41.390
I wanted go give you something.

20:41.710 --> 20:42.410
What for?

20:42.790 --> 20:44.740
Kevin,can-- Can we have a little alone time?

20:46.140 --> 20:47.720
Alone time? My girlfriend--

20:47.730 --> 20:49.540
Oh,my god. This is like being in camp.

20:49.560 --> 20:52.650
You know what? Have the tent.I'm just not standing guard.

20:54.150 --> 20:57.740
Okay. So I really wanted to wait Until you told the entire family,

20:57.750 --> 20:59.400
But I couldn't,so... here.

20:59.420 --> 21:00.720
Becca,I didn't even get you a ring yet.

21:00.730 --> 21:02.470
I don't care. Just open it.

21:06.140 --> 21:08.015
Oh,my god. It's beautiful.

21:08.050 --> 21:10.335
-You like it?
-I love it. Are you kidding me?

21:10.370 --> 21:13.480
It even has a little sweep second hand For when you take people's pulses.

21:13.515 --> 21:16.500
I don't know what to-- Thank you.

21:19.570 --> 21:21.805
So I don't know. I mean,do you want to...

21:21.840 --> 21:24.040
You want to tell everyone today or...

21:24.075 --> 21:26.375
-T-- I don't kw.
-What?

21:26.410 --> 21:29.180
You know,maybe now is not the right time.We haven't even seen tommy yet.

21:29.215 --> 21:30.875
But he's fine.There's no cult. I mean,he's--

21:30.910 --> 21:35.400
I know,I know.But my mom is,you know,my mom-- She's fragile.

21:35.435 --> 21:38.350
Let me just let this,you know,play out a little bit.

21:38.385 --> 21:39.675
Okay,sure.

21:39.710 --> 21:40.765
But you'll still wear it,right?

21:40.800 --> 21:43.270
Of course. Are you-- I'm never gonna take it off.This is--

21:43.305 --> 21:46.830

-No,he has a beard.
-Well,so? Tommy could have a beard.

21:58.715 --> 22:00.225
I mean,we don't know what he looks like these days.

22:00.260 --> 22:03.530
Oh,it's weird,how nervous we are About seeing our own brother.

22:03.565 --> 22:04.645
He's the one who should be nervous.

22:04.680 --> 22:07.320
All right now. No judgment. Do you remember?

22:07.355 --> 22:09.347
We're gonna be loving and supportive..

22:09.382 --> 22:11.305
Beard or no beard,do you understand?

22:11.340 --> 22:13.915
And one other thing,let's not overwhelm him.

22:13.950 --> 22:15.590
-No,mom's right.
-He doesn't know we're here,all right?

22:15.625 --> 22:17.230
-Mom,mom--
-When he comes in,let's not jump all over him.

22:17.265 --> 22:18.840
-Let's take the cue from him.
-Mom.

-I missed you. How are you?

22:34.965 --> 22:38.250
What have you been doing? Are you okay?

22:42.620 --> 22:45.970
Silence...Is as deep as eternity.

22:46.005 --> 22:49.285
Speech is as shallow as time.

22:49.320 --> 22:51.330
And this place is nutty as a fruitcake.

22:51.365 --> 22:53.900
-Kevin.
-What?

23:18.910 --> 23:20.530
*****

24:40.140 --> 24:41.475
My-- My son got into medical school.

24:41.510 --> 24:42.950
We just got very excited. It won't happen again.

24:42.985 --> 24:45.245
That's wonderful.

24:45.280 --> 24:51.790
Thomas,you can stay or go,But your family needs to leave.

24:58.300 --> 25:00.760
-What's that?
-I have no idea.

25:18.200 --> 25:19.285
Where's kitty?

25:19.320 --> 25:22.100

25:22.135 --> 25:24.050
-Who still needs one?
-I do.

25:24.085 --> 25:25.445
Oh,I'll have another.

25:25.480 --> 25:28.095
You just got town out on your ass.Can you show a little restraint?

25:28.130 --> 25:30.675
Oh,I'm sorry.I probably shouldn't have landed the chopper sclose.

25:30.710 --> 25:34.930
Why did you land the chopper at all?Don't you have some big speech in d.C.?

25:34.965 --> 25:36.805
Kitty,he's making this his priority.

25:36.840 --> 25:39.635
It's okay. They were gonna get kicked out anyway.

25:39.670 --> 25:42.270
We're gonna be real good now. Tommy,how are you?

25:42.305 --> 25:44.835
-Yeah,mom says you're in a cult.
-I did not.

25:44.870 --> 25:48.335
-Yes,you did.
-No,I-- You know,I was just concerned,that's all.

25:48.370 --> 25:52.810
I wasn't. Scotty and I were meant to go To laguna this weekend toelebrate our anniversary.

25:52.845 --> 25:55.140
Congratulations,kev. I'm sorry I ruined your weekend.

25:55.175 --> 25:57.375
Shut up,kevin. You didn't ruin anything,tommy.

25:57.410 --> 26:01.340
Tommy,talk to us. A- Are you feeling all right?You-- You like tired? You okay?

26:01.375 --> 26:03.135
Mom,he's fine. Just relax.

26:03.170 --> 26:06.270
Just because you got in to medical school Does not mean you know everything.

26:06.305 --> 26:08.050
What? Wait a minute,you didn't tell me you got in.

26:08.085 --> 26:09.985
Justin doesn't like to share his good news.

26:10.020 --> 26:11.960
At least mom can stop worrying About one of her sons.

26:11.995 --> 26:13.645
Oh,would you stop judging tommy?

26:13.680 --> 26:15.530
Look,yodon't need to protect me. It's okay.

26:15.565 --> 26:17.792
It's not okay. We all make mistakes.

26:17.827 --> 26:19.985
Sometimes you just can't fix them.

26:20.020 --> 26:22.500
Well,you try to fix them. That's why I'm here.

26:22.535 --> 26:24.505
Just stop being such an egomaniac,robert.

26:24.540 --> 26:28.220
Whatever is going on with tommy is not gonna be solved Because you descended from the sky.

26:28.255 --> 26:30.895
I was talking about us.

26:30.930 --> 26:34.990
What about you?Is there-- Is there something wrong with you?

26:36.450 --> 26:38.150
Robert and I are separating.

26:38.185 --> 26:41.300
-What?
-You are?

26:42.600 --> 26:45.070
-You just had a baby.What about little evan?
-I know i just had a baby,mother.

26:45.105 --> 26:46.485
-Obviously I'm aware--
-Guys.

26:46.520 --> 26:48.815
-What?
-Could we not get into that right now?

26:48.850 --> 26:51.875
-Remember,we're here for tommy. Please.
-I'm very sorry.

26:51.910 --> 26:54.330
-Where are you going?
-Ma,I just,I know where this is heading,

26:54.365 --> 26:56.760
And I don't want to watch.

27:04.990 --> 27:07.970
Why did you have me come down here?

27:08.440 --> 27:11.105
Ah,finally. Finally,it all makes sense.

27:11.140 --> 27:13.670
So you came down because you thought You would get exactly what you wanted,

27:13.705 --> 27:17.150
-Just like every other greedy politician.
-Kitty.

27:17.185 --> 27:20.090
Can I talk to you outside?

27:33.840 --> 27:36.410
You want a separation,you got it.

27:36.445 --> 27:38.945
'Cse I'm done. I am done chasing you.

27:38.980 --> 27:41.265
I am done trying to figure out what you want.

27:41.300 --> 27:43.515
If you want to move to pasadena,move to pasadena.

27:43.550 --> 27:46.025
You want to take evan with you,We'll work out the terms of the custody.

27:46.060 --> 27:48.500
You want to tell everybody in the world That we're separating,do it.

27:48.535 --> 27:51.135
-Robert--
-Because you just closed the deal.

27:51.170 --> 27:54.825
Have kevin work out the details,whatever you think is fair.

27:54.860 --> 27:57.350
And for the record,I didn't come down here Because kevin told me to.

27:57.385 --> 27:59.870
And I wasn't fighting you on the terms of the separation

27:59.905 --> 28:01.175
Because I wanted to be governor.

28:01.210 --> 28:03.685
I was fighting you on the terms of the separation

28:03.720 --> 28:06.160
Because I believe that if you move out of our home...

28:06.195 --> 28:09.820
That you will never come back.

28:10.710 --> 28:14.700
You want a separation?This is what one looks like.

28:22.320 --> 28:25.680
So much for being switzerland.

28:26.280 --> 28:29.185
Mom,I-I need to stay here.

28:29.220 --> 28:31.035
I'm need to work some things out.

28:31.070 --> 28:34.940
I think I understand how you were feeling at ojai now.

28:34.975 --> 28:37.220
I think you were trying to hold on to the family.

28:37.255 --> 28:38.555
That's what we're doing.

28:38.590 --> 28:40.710
That's why we need you to come home.

28:40.745 --> 28:42.795
-No,you don't.
-Yes,we do.We d tommy.

28:42.830 --> 28:46.670
Tommy,I'm sorry.I'm sorry I hit you. I'm sorry I let you down.

28:46.705 --> 28:49.110
You needed me,and I wasn't there for you. I'm sorry.

28:49.145 --> 28:50.742
Justin's so right. I can't listen to this.

28:50.777 --> 28:52.305
-What is your problem?
-You know what,sarah?

28:52.340 --> 28:54.905
If you want to sit around And tell him how great he is,do that.

28:54.940 --> 28:58.550
He abandoned his child and his wife And he betrayed every single one of us,

28:58.585 --> 29:00.955
Then ran down here to hide.

29:00.990 --> 29:05.000
They may need you,tommy. I'm sorry. I don't.

29:09.230 --> 29:11.000
Tommy,don't... don't listen to him.

29:11.035 --> 29:12.170
He doesn't understand.

29:12.205 --> 29:14.805
Mom,he's right.

29:14.840 --> 29:18.395
Everything he said,I did. I did all those things.

29:18.430 --> 29:22.560
I destroyed everything,then I fell apart.I had a breakdown.

29:22.595 --> 29:28.830
Please just allow me e dignity to own that.Please.

29:28.865 --> 29:31.740
I have to go.

I mean,I'm not ready to give up on 'em,And you shouldn't either.I mean,come on,don't--

30:46.465 --> 30:49.905
Don't you want your dad to walk you down the aisle?

30:49.940 --> 30:53.310
I mean,I'm sorry. I just-- I just want to get married In front of our families,that's all.

30:53.345 --> 30:58.930
Ally?Because you wouldn't even tell them that we're engaged.

30:59.300 --> 31:02.040
Rebecca...

31:07.560 --> 31:10.150
Are you all right?

31:10.185 --> 31:12.740
I'm trying to be,mom.

31:14.110 --> 31:18.480
So... this place is really helping you?

31:19.250 --> 31:21.180
It is.

31:21.215 --> 31:23.110
Good.

31:23.320 --> 31:26.340
I'm glad you're here. I...

31:26.375 --> 31:29.360
I'm glad you found it.

31:30.660 --> 31:34.425
Do you want to talk about anything?

31:34.460 --> 31:38.930
You guys are the ones who like talking,Not me.

31:46.980 --> 31:49.880
-This a bad time?
-No,come in.

31:50.600 --> 31:51.905
Oh,what's this?

31:51.940 --> 31:54.200
This is the severance package for ryan lafferty.

31:54.235 --> 31:56.167
Oh,thank you.

31:56.202 --> 31:57.951
How'd he take it?

31:57.986 --> 31:59.665
It isn't signed.

31:59.700 --> 32:03.460
-He refused?
-I refused to let him sign it.

32:03.495 --> 32:05.660
May I?

32:07.430 --> 32:11.500
I want to come back to ojai,holly,To keep an eye on ryan.

32:11.535 --> 32:14.382
-You're joking.
-No,no,I'm not joking.

32:14.417 --> 32:17.863
I just feel he deserves better than this.

32:17.898 --> 32:21.310
You're gonna have to give me more than that.

32:23.640 --> 32:26.860
William wanted to end His relationship with ryan's mother.

32:26.895 --> 32:29.810
He was gonna fly to reno and pay her off,

32:29.845 --> 32:33.710
Whatever it took.

32:34.400 --> 32:37.800
And then sarah went into labor with coop,so--

32:37.835 --> 32:40.600
So he sent you,didn't he?

32:40.635 --> 32:42.205
He did.

32:42.240 --> 32:48.165
I brought her a check,Told her that she was never to contact william again.

32:48.200 --> 32:53.460
She was devastated,Humiliated that william didn't have the decency To do it himself.

32:53.495 --> 33:00.060
She went crazy.She was screaming at me and crying and...

33:01.410 --> 33:07.710
And I have to say That I resented my part in it so much...

33:07.745 --> 33:10.812
And I was unfeeling.

33:10.847 --> 33:13.845
And then the next day...

33:13.880 --> 33:18.770
When I heard about the accident...

33:21.690 --> 33:24.990
-Saul--
-I have to do this,holly...

33:25.025 --> 33:28.765
For her.He's her son.

33:28.800 --> 33:33.480
I'm not responsible for your mistakes.

33:33.515 --> 33:35.905
Please.

33:35.940 --> 33:41.310
Saul,you'll owe me.

33:41.345 --> 33:44.225
Yeah.

33:44.260 --> 33:46.855
I want ojai to stay a family company.

33:46.890 --> 33:49.275
I don't know what it is if it's not that.

33:49.310 --> 33:51.625
I never planned to be the only walker there.

33:51.660 --> 33:55.480
Well,you may not have expected it,But it doesn't surprise me.

33:55.920 --> 33:59.790
I mean,ojai was always gonna be yours.I knew it. Dad knew it. Even tommy knew it.

33:59.825 --> 34:03.615
I'm sorry,but you're the heir apparent.

34:03.650 --> 34:06.275
That's pretty funny coming from the princess.

34:06.310 --> 34:08.864
-Princess?
-Like belle,not sleeping beauty.

34:08.900 --> 34:12.159
Come on,kitty. You always had A fairy-Tale vision for your life.

34:12.195 --> 34:14.094
It completely explains your politics.

34:14.130 --> 34:18.880
That's ridiculous,And-- And anyway,my-- My knight in shining armor Turned out to be a frog.

34:18.915 --> 34:21.960
I think the frog turned into a prince.

34:21.995 --> 34:24.800
Whatever,okay? It's over.

34:24.835 --> 34:27.185
It's over.

34:27.219 --> 34:31.170
Robert and I are over.

34:31.205 --> 34:35.172
Only if you want it to be.

34:35.206 --> 34:39.139
Do you? Is that what you want?

34:42.760 --> 34:44.969
Yeah,well,it's too late. He's leaving.

34:45.005 --> 34:46.600
-Is that what you want?
-Sarah--

34:46.635 --> 34:50.320
Decide.

34:53.030 --> 34:54.045
No.

34:54.080 --> 34:56.150
Then go.

34:56.185 --> 34:58.220
Go,kitty.

35:50.130 --> 35:55.810
* Ah,but I was so much older then *

35:55.845 --> 36:01.410
* I'm younger than that now *

36:04.500 --> 36:09.100
* Lake *

36:20.540 --> 36:22.590
Justin,are you gonna give us a hand over here?

36:22.625 --> 36:23.805
In a minute,all right?

36:23.840 --> 36:25.400
Down. Down over here. All right,you know what?

36:25.435 --> 36:26.925
I think you need to go a little bit higher,mom.

36:26.960 --> 36:29.460
-You need to go lower.
-Mom,mom,mom,mom,we have to pull this pipe out.

36:29.495 --> 36:31.560
I know we need to get the pipe out.

36:31.880 --> 36:33.975
Hey,kev.

36:34.010 --> 36:36.865
I,uh,I heard you at the bar.

36:36.900 --> 36:39.720
You saw me for who I was.

36:39.755 --> 36:41.875
You always have.

36:41.910 --> 36:45.540
I called julia this morning.She-- She won't take my calls,but...

36:45.575 --> 36:47.635
I'm gonna keep trying.

36:47.670 --> 36:51.050
And I'm gonna be a father to elizabeth.

36:51.085 --> 36:53.300
Good.

36:53.770 --> 36:55.540
I'm trying to change.

36:55.575 --> 36:57.275
-It's not easy.
-I know.

36:57.310 --> 37:00.880
-I just hope that when I do--
-I'll see that,too.

37:02.990 --> 37:05.965
That's all I want.

37:06.000 --> 37:09.980
Hey,justin!For god sake,are you gonna give us a hand here or what?

37:10.015 --> 37:12.050
In a minute.

37:13.490 --> 37:14.305
What are you doing?

37:14.340 --> 37:16.905
Rebecca,in front of god...

37:16.940 --> 37:18.670
-Oh,my god.
-Buddha and everyone I love--

37:18.705 --> 37:20.415
-Justin--
-Rebecca,I love you,

37:20.450 --> 37:24.810
And I want everyone here to know that you're gonna be my wife.

37:27.780 --> 37:30.660
Rebecca...

37:31.210 --> 37:34.075
Will you marry me?

37:34.110 --> 37:36.940
Of course I will.

37:59.180 --> 38:01.840
Did you talk to her?

38:02.200 --> 38:06.670
She didn't come in to work,And she hasn't returned my call.

38:06.705 --> 38:09.100
She's angry.

38:09.470 --> 38:10.715
What's that?

38:10.750 --> 38:15.830
A receipt. I found it on her desk.

38:17.240 --> 38:21.160
$20,000? That's a nice watch.

38:21.195 --> 38:23.807
I've seen her like this before.

38:23.842 --> 38:26.385
What do you mean,"like this"?

38:26.420 --> 38:29.345
Erratic,impulsive,rushing into things.

38:29.380 --> 38:31.870
I mean,you should've seen her in high school.

38:31.905 --> 38:33.475
She was a teenage girl.

38:33.510 --> 38:37.650
I'm not an expert,but that sounds pretty typical.

38:38.850 --> 38:42.970
Did she ever tell you about chicago?

38:43.710 --> 38:46.485
She mentioned that she lived there,that's all.

38:46.520 --> 38:49.670
She started sleeping with her social studies teacher.

38:49.705 --> 38:52.875
He was married with two kids.

38:52.910 --> 38:56.730
And when he left l.A.,She followed him to chicago.

38:56.765 --> 38:59.265
She was 16 when she took off.

38:59.300 --> 39:02.395
She stayed in a hotel,she lived off credit cards,

39:02.430 --> 39:09.470
And the only times I ever got any phone calls Were from collection agencies.

39:09.505 --> 39:12.320
David,she has been so good,

39:12.355 --> 39:14.155
So strong and steady.

39:14.190 --> 39:17.760
But she still is. Just have faith in that.

39:17.795 --> 39:20.425
I'm trying to,but what if this--

39:20.460 --> 39:26.350
Holly,whatever happens,we're gonna deal with it.

39:30.370 --> 39:32.645
Well,I don't know why I was so anxious To get this thing back.

39:32.680 --> 39:36.970
I'm sure there's nothing remotely interesting Or important or enlightening on it.

39:37.005 --> 39:39.025
Listen to you,tossing around the "e" word.

39:39.060 --> 39:41.545
Maybe I learned something over the last few days.

39:41.580 --> 39:44.340
Really?The only thing I learned is that vegan food gives me the trots.

39:44.375 --> 39:47.150
-Oh,kevin,that is so disgusting.
-It's true.

39:47.185 --> 39:48.640
I think our bus is here.

39:48.675 --> 39:51.470
Oh,yay. Let's go.

39:52.660 --> 39:54.600
Oh,sarah,do you have the plane tickets?

39:54.635 --> 39:56.345
Yep. Oh,no. I...

39:56.380 --> 40:00.330
I forgot to give tommy his picture.

40:03.430 --> 40:05.940

40:05.975 --> 40:08.450

40:18.500 --> 40:21.250
Ah,kev.What does this remind you of?

40:21.285 --> 40:23.235
How much I hate bus travel.

40:23.270 --> 40:27.250
-Oh,come on. Think about it.
-Come on. It's camp lackawanna.

40:27.285 --> 40:30.770
Oh,my god. This is just like camp lackawanna.

40:30.805 --> 40:32.345
Yeah. Sorry,mom.

40:32.380 --> 40:44.195

40:44.230 --> 40:56.010

-Look. Look.

41:04.575 --> 41:07.860

41:21.340 --> 41:23.135
* Way down here *

41:23.170 --> 41:25.420
* You need a reason to move *

41:25.455 --> 41:27.225
* Feel a fool *

41:27.260 --> 41:29.560
* Runnin' your stateside games *

41:29.595 --> 41:31.495
* Lose your load *

41:31.530 --> 41:34.930
* Leave your mind behind,baby james *

41:34.965 --> 41:38.175

41:38.210 --> 41:42.435
