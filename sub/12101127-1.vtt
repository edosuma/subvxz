WEBVTT

01:19.653 --> 01:22.556
Okay, Daisy, here we go.

01:22.588 --> 01:25.625
You are ready!

01:25.659 --> 01:28.562
Ladies
and gentle-mammals.

01:28.594 --> 01:31.564
Sanctuary City's
favorite champion,

01:31.597 --> 01:34.667
Daisy Quokka!

01:38.005 --> 01:40.473
She's the Quokka
Weight Champion

01:40.506 --> 01:43.476
of the entire world!

01:44.877 --> 01:47.013
- I love that quokka!
- Whoo-hoo!

01:47.047 --> 01:50.684
Let's hear it for your champion!

01:50.716 --> 01:53.953
This is a dream come true!

01:53.987 --> 01:57.758
Whoo-hoo! Yes! Come on!

01:57.791 --> 01:59.927
Alright! Huh?

02:01.794 --> 02:03.763
I said this is

02:03.797 --> 02:08.669
a dream come tru-u-u-u-ue!

02:11.705 --> 02:12.807
Oh..

02:26.086 --> 02:28.022
Frankie?

02:32.092 --> 02:34.795
Oh. What's going on?

02:50.910 --> 02:51.912
Ah!

03:01.821 --> 03:04.557
I can't do it. I can't do it!

03:07.927 --> 03:10.063
I can't do it. I can't do it!

03:17.004 --> 03:19.006
- Ah!
- Rarr!

03:19.039 --> 03:20.741
Ah! Ah!

03:20.773 --> 03:22.041
Up and at 'em, kiddo!

03:23.710 --> 03:24.979
Uh, dad?

03:25.011 --> 03:27.281
- Huh!
- Whoo-hoo, a dollar!

03:27.313 --> 03:29.783
- Ooh, dad!
- Morning!

03:32.753 --> 03:34.856
Ah, she must be up already.

03:36.156 --> 03:39.125
Golly gee, right in the snout!

03:39.158 --> 03:41.127
You're sleeping on the floor
again, kiddo.

03:41.160 --> 03:43.730
You know, if you're trying
to fix that lower back,

03:43.764 --> 03:45.565
you need one of these rollers.

03:45.599 --> 03:48.903
Morning, sweetie.
I knew I heard voices.

03:48.936 --> 03:51.571
Oh, right in the snout again!

03:51.605 --> 03:54.542
Daisy! What have you done
with your hair, little miss?

03:54.575 --> 03:56.643
- Mum, I just got up from...
- Like I was saying, kiddo.

03:56.676 --> 03:58.978
You gotta roll out
and transform that lower back.

03:59.011 --> 04:00.948
- Dad, I don't need to...
- Always brush...

04:00.980 --> 04:03.616
Before and after you wake up,
sweetie. Keeps the knots out.

04:03.650 --> 04:06.119
♪ Brush brush brush
brush it good ♪

04:06.152 --> 04:07.153
♪ Da-na-na da ♪♪

04:07.187 --> 04:09.557
Exactly. No more knots.

04:10.924 --> 04:12.926
My name is Daisy Quokka.

04:12.960 --> 04:14.562
And this?

04:14.594 --> 04:17.797
This is how I start
each and every day.

04:17.830 --> 04:19.799
♪ Brush brush brush ♪
♪ Roll roll roll it out ♪♪

04:19.832 --> 04:23.136
Okay, okay, I'm sorry, hon,
I didn't mean to spook ya,

04:23.169 --> 04:24.938
but it is time to get up!
Come on!

04:24.972 --> 04:28.909
Dad, be careful. Mm...

04:32.813 --> 04:35.783
<i>Daisy, Daisy, Daisy...</i>

04:37.950 --> 04:41.654
Ah, yup! One of the greats.

04:41.688 --> 04:43.724
Who is he again? Nah.

04:43.757 --> 04:45.926
- I'm sure it'll hit me.
- His name is on the...

04:45.959 --> 04:49.697
Eat up, sweetie, to make those
smiley cheeks nice and toned.

04:49.729 --> 04:53.666
Besides, why would you wanna
stay in bed dreaming all day

04:53.700 --> 04:55.803
when we're living the dream?

04:57.871 --> 05:01.140
- Yup. That's the beach.
- The beach!

05:01.174 --> 05:04.745
We live right on the beach,
Daisy.

05:04.777 --> 05:08.081
I mean, have you seen it today?
Look at those waves.

05:08.114 --> 05:11.217
The third-degree sunburn,
and that sand!

05:11.250 --> 05:13.387
- So grainy!
- Ah! It's hot!

05:13.419 --> 05:15.088
See those guys having fun!?

05:15.121 --> 05:17.724
Oh, what the hey.
I'm gonna say hi!

05:17.758 --> 05:21.928
Surf's up, dudes!
Howdy-do, fellow grommets?

05:21.962 --> 05:24.698
<i>So, are we living
the dream?</i>

05:24.731 --> 05:27.767
<i>Some might say yes, depending
on how you look at it.</i>

05:29.236 --> 05:32.072
<i>We all live
on a beautiful island.</i>

05:32.104 --> 05:34.807
<i>This is Quokka Rocks,</i>

05:34.840 --> 05:38.177
<i>about ten kilometers off
the coast of Sanctuary City.</i>

05:38.210 --> 05:42.015
<i>Sandy beaches, sunny skies,
salty air...</i>

05:42.049 --> 05:43.717
<i>Oh, and one more thing.</i>

05:43.750 --> 05:47.053
- Quokkas!
- Quokkas! Quokkas!

05:47.087 --> 05:49.089
<i>Wait! Hold up one sec!</i>

05:49.121 --> 05:52.158
You do know what a Quokka is,
right?

05:52.191 --> 05:54.794
Well, let me educate ya.

05:54.827 --> 05:56.130
Lights, please!

05:56.162 --> 05:58.131
Thank you.

05:59.832 --> 06:02.068
We quokkas
are a strange species.

06:02.101 --> 06:05.938
Kind of half-kangaroo, half-rat,
crossed with a teddy bear,

06:05.972 --> 06:09.710
- resulting in a quokka.
- My eyes!

06:09.743 --> 06:11.245
Change it. Change it. Change it!

06:11.277 --> 06:14.881
Ah, phew! Much more like it!

06:14.914 --> 06:17.750
We used to live
a quiet, peaceful life,

06:17.784 --> 06:20.187
all alone
on ye old Quokka Rocks.

06:20.219 --> 06:22.955
I am so, so lost.

06:22.988 --> 06:26.794
Hey you, you,
can you please help me?

06:26.827 --> 06:28.963
Thank you so very much.

06:30.830 --> 06:33.900
<i>One selfie
changed it all.</i>

06:34.900 --> 06:36.936
That smile!

06:44.510 --> 06:48.314
<i>Next minute, everyone wanted
a selfie with a smiling quokka!</i>

06:48.347 --> 06:50.083
Yeah, we were a hit!

06:50.116 --> 06:53.787
And not just a big hit.
A really big hit!

06:56.089 --> 06:58.158
<i>It was totally wild!</i>

06:58.190 --> 07:00.260
<i>We were on T-Shirts,
beach towels,</i>

07:00.292 --> 07:02.795
<i>breakfast cereals,
toilet rolls,</i>

07:02.828 --> 07:05.865
<i>last-minute Wishmas gifts,
mugs, calendars,</i>

07:05.899 --> 07:09.036
<i>motivational posters,
un-motivational posters,</i>

07:09.068 --> 07:11.170
and even ice blocks!

07:11.203 --> 07:14.307
And I'll admit it,
we are pretty dang cute.

07:14.340 --> 07:18.111
We're so cute, in fact, that all
quokkas now work in tourism,

07:18.145 --> 07:19.813
taking selfies.

07:27.087 --> 07:31.325
<i>And my parents oversee
the entire industry.</i>

07:31.358 --> 07:32.893
<i>Now, don't get me wrong,</i>

07:32.926 --> 07:33.961
<i>I love a good smile</i>

07:33.993 --> 07:35.762
<i>as much as the next quokka.</i>

07:35.796 --> 07:37.164
<i>And when you live
in a place like this,</i>

07:37.197 --> 07:40.000
<i>how can you
not be living the dream?</i>

07:40.032 --> 07:43.003
- Quokka!
- Here's your peanut here.

07:43.036 --> 07:45.806
<i>But whatever happened
to mine?</i>

07:52.077 --> 07:54.113
<i>For centuries,</i>

07:54.147 --> 07:57.183
<i>animals proved themselves
in the wild.</i>

07:57.217 --> 08:02.056
<i>And now respect is earned
in the arena!</i>

08:03.323 --> 08:06.827
<i>This is
the World's Scariest Games!</i>

08:06.859 --> 08:10.163
- Wow!
- <i>And there it is, folks.</i>

08:10.197 --> 08:12.900
<i>Frankie slams the buzzer
once again,</i>

08:12.933 --> 08:16.969
<i>winning his fourth WSG title.</i>

08:17.003 --> 08:18.372
Frankie!

08:18.404 --> 08:19.873
<i>From that moment on,</i>

08:19.905 --> 08:21.140
<i>I began my training to win</i>

08:21.174 --> 08:23.142
<i>the World's Scariest Games!</i>

08:23.176 --> 08:24.311
Huh?

08:27.046 --> 08:29.249
Mm! Ah!

08:31.116 --> 08:32.885
- I'm okay!
- What?

08:37.957 --> 08:38.958
Whoo!

08:41.193 --> 08:45.031
Ah!

08:45.064 --> 08:48.267
<i>But as Frankie says,
"Never give up on your dreams."</i>

08:48.300 --> 08:52.371
<i>So I didn't, and I actually
got pretty darn good.</i>

08:52.404 --> 08:54.908
And then you have to swing
across the vines to the finish,

08:54.941 --> 08:58.345
but you can't land on the floor
because the floor is lava!

09:03.650 --> 09:05.919
Whoo-hoo!

09:05.952 --> 09:10.057
<i>I mean, for one,
the games are finally back here</i>

09:10.090 --> 09:12.059
<i>in Sanctuary City!</i>

09:12.092 --> 09:15.028
<i>So, yes,
maybe we are living the dream,</i>

09:15.060 --> 09:17.196
<i>but it's time to live mine.</i>

09:17.230 --> 09:19.900
<i>Today is the day
that I finally tell my parents</i>

09:19.933 --> 09:22.269
<i>what I'm going to do
with my life.</i>

09:22.302 --> 09:25.906
- Mum, dad.
- Mm-ah!

09:25.938 --> 09:27.875
So good!

09:27.908 --> 09:29.943
- Ah-ahem!
- Huh! Daisy!

09:29.976 --> 09:33.080
Your mother and I actually need
to talk to you, too.

09:33.112 --> 09:34.347
Oh! You did?

09:34.380 --> 09:37.150
We know that tomorrow
is a big day in the city

09:37.183 --> 09:39.986
with the World's Scariest Games
starting and all.

09:40.020 --> 09:41.954
- You do?
- We sure do.

09:41.987 --> 09:43.356
- Go on.
- So...

09:43.390 --> 09:46.092
- Your mother and I saved up...
- Yuh-huh.

09:46.125 --> 09:49.062
And bought you a ferry ticket

09:49.095 --> 09:51.231
to Sanctuary City!

09:51.264 --> 09:54.967
- To Sanctuary City?
- So you can be...

09:55.000 --> 09:59.372
So I can be
The World's Scariest Animal!

10:06.346 --> 10:09.950
Ambitious and funny.
Just like her old man.

10:12.318 --> 10:13.986
What are we laughing about, huh?

10:17.023 --> 10:19.326
Oh! That's not a joke.

10:19.358 --> 10:21.193
Honey, she's... she's not
telling a joke.

10:21.226 --> 10:24.231
Ah, uh, sweetie, uh,

10:24.264 --> 10:26.500
that is not what quokkas do.

10:26.533 --> 10:30.236
Quokkas
are... are small and smiley.

10:30.270 --> 10:31.270
- I know, but...
- Like...

10:31.303 --> 10:33.140
Look at these tiny weak arms.

10:33.173 --> 10:36.543
And these problematic
sausage-shaped fingers.

10:36.576 --> 10:39.712
Like, seriously,
who designed us?

10:39.746 --> 10:44.284
What we were going
to say is we want you to be

10:44.317 --> 10:46.953
the new face of Quokka Rocks!

10:49.255 --> 10:50.289
What?

10:50.323 --> 10:53.125
Honey, things are changing.

10:53.159 --> 10:54.995
We're getting older and now that

10:55.028 --> 10:56.462
you're no longer
our little girl...

10:56.496 --> 11:00.100
Even though you'll always be
our little girl.

11:00.132 --> 11:02.735
We really want you to take up
the family business,

11:02.769 --> 11:06.273
putting that big smile of yours
to work.

11:06.305 --> 11:09.742
So you didn't get me a ticket
to the games?

11:09.775 --> 11:14.080
The games? But those athletes
are big and scary.

11:14.114 --> 11:16.550
And they don't smile!
They don't smile, Daisy.

11:16.582 --> 11:19.318
- Dad, but what if I...
- No smiles, but we smile.

11:19.351 --> 11:22.154
- Dad, it's...
- It's what we were born to do!

11:22.188 --> 11:24.191
- Mum, it's...
- It's in our DNA!

11:24.223 --> 11:26.193
We love it when you smile!

11:26.226 --> 11:28.327
Because we love you!

11:28.361 --> 11:30.330
And quokkas love smiles!

11:30.362 --> 11:32.431
It's what we all dream of!

11:32.465 --> 11:35.335
But what if
I don't want to smile?

11:35.367 --> 11:37.436
- Huh?
- Ah? What?

11:37.470 --> 11:39.473
She don't wanna smile?

11:50.250 --> 11:54.453
Oh, honey, that's not how the
face of Quokka Rocks should act.

11:54.486 --> 11:57.123
I mean,
you've got an example to set.

11:57.156 --> 11:58.525
A smiley example!

11:58.558 --> 12:00.527
Oh, that reminds me, we should...

12:00.559 --> 12:05.431
- Practice my smiles.
- Practice your smiles!

12:05.465 --> 12:08.502
- Smile, sweetie!
- Ah...

12:08.534 --> 12:13.372
Oh, look at that. Almost
as good as the real thing.

12:13.405 --> 12:16.208
Ah, it sure is.

12:16.241 --> 12:18.310
Welcome to Sanctuary City.

12:18.343 --> 12:20.513
Please make sure you have
all of your belongings

12:20.547 --> 12:22.149
as you disembark.

12:33.559 --> 12:35.462
Aw, what's a quokka doing here?

12:35.495 --> 12:38.231
Come on, we're gonna miss
the athletes!

12:38.264 --> 12:40.400
The athletes!

12:43.135 --> 12:45.505
Oh, that's a steep hill.

12:47.340 --> 12:52.412
Come on! Come on!

12:52.444 --> 12:54.580
Why is this so heavy?

12:57.483 --> 13:01.687
Ah, you heavy piece of junk!

13:01.721 --> 13:04.424
- Huh?
- Huh!

13:04.457 --> 13:06.092
- Hm.
- Oh, no, no.

13:06.125 --> 13:08.095
I meant the stand, not you.

13:08.127 --> 13:11.263
Oh, no, no, no, no,
you don't!

13:17.736 --> 13:19.305
Wait.

13:42.261 --> 13:44.698
- Wow!
- That's right, folks!

13:44.731 --> 13:47.634
Just like your heroes wear!

13:47.667 --> 13:50.904
We've got your hometown
Sanctuary City!

13:50.937 --> 13:53.640
Or get fired up for Fire Isle!

13:53.673 --> 13:57.476
Hundred percent real,
definitely not fake.

13:57.510 --> 13:59.545
Oh, do you have anything
with Frankie Scales?

13:59.578 --> 14:04.150
Frankie who? Um, no.
But we've got Drago shirts.

14:04.183 --> 14:05.584
- Drago!
- Ah!

14:16.261 --> 14:18.531
- Oh!
- And say scary!

14:18.564 --> 14:22.268
- Scary!
- Oh, thank you.

14:26.405 --> 14:28.574
Ah.

14:28.607 --> 14:32.445
Welcome
to the World's Scariest Games!

14:33.413 --> 14:34.414
Ow!

14:39.685 --> 14:41.554
...live cross in 30 seconds.

14:41.587 --> 14:43.390
Pardon me. Sorry.

14:43.423 --> 14:45.491
Just want to scooch through
there, thank you.

14:48.995 --> 14:53.400
And we're on in three, two...

14:53.433 --> 14:55.702
The one and only
Flightless Feather here,

14:55.735 --> 14:58.404
reporting to you live
from Sanctuary Stadium.

14:58.438 --> 15:00.640
Fans are descending on
the downtown area for a chance

15:00.673 --> 15:02.708
to get a glimpse
of their favorite athletes

15:02.741 --> 15:04.777
as they arrive
from across the globe

15:04.810 --> 15:06.745
for the games
commencing this week.

15:06.779 --> 15:09.716
The hosting city is still very
much in the selection process.

15:09.749 --> 15:12.519
As hosts, Sanctuary City
receives not one

15:12.552 --> 15:13.820
but two entrants for the games,

15:13.852 --> 15:16.488
with qualifying rounds
starting tomorrow!

15:16.521 --> 15:17.656
Oh, one second!

15:17.689 --> 15:19.491
Here with me now
is the hot favorite

15:19.525 --> 15:20.760
for our Sanctuary City team,

15:20.793 --> 15:24.563
the mean,
green climbing machine,

15:24.597 --> 15:26.299
Ronda Saltie!

15:26.332 --> 15:27.701
- 'Sup, Flightless?
- Huh!

15:27.733 --> 15:29.435
She said my name!

15:29.468 --> 15:32.304
Ronda, what does it mean
for you to be the favorite

15:32.337 --> 15:35.442
to qualify leading
into the games in your hometown?

15:35.475 --> 15:38.345
Well, Flightless, winning
these games isn't just for me,

15:38.377 --> 15:39.778
it's for all the animals
out there

15:39.812 --> 15:42.448
who believe
dreams can come true.

15:42.481 --> 15:45.552
- Huh!
- On you, Ronda.

15:45.584 --> 15:47.720
In the lead-up to these games,
Ronda has undergone

15:47.754 --> 15:49.656
an extreme training regime,

15:49.688 --> 15:54.026
coached by former WSG champion,
Jerry Whiskers.

15:54.059 --> 15:57.363
Under that leadership, Ronda
Saltie is Sanctuary City's

15:57.396 --> 16:01.600
golden hope for victory, heading
into the World's Scariest Games.

16:02.802 --> 16:05.572
I'm Flightless Feather,
flying off.

16:05.605 --> 16:09.442
Excuse me? Ronda? Excuse me.
Hi!

16:09.475 --> 16:12.579
What you just said was just
really inspirational for...

16:12.611 --> 16:14.780
This area is press only, kid.

16:14.813 --> 16:16.750
- Beat it!
- Shh.

16:16.783 --> 16:19.385
- And you are?
- Oh, of course!

16:19.419 --> 16:20.720
Manners, Daisy, manners!

16:20.752 --> 16:23.055
My name is Daisy Quokka.

16:23.088 --> 16:26.492
And I'm here to try out
for the World's Scariest Games!

16:28.528 --> 16:31.731
Try out? For the games?

16:31.764 --> 16:33.533
You're... you're a quokka.

16:33.566 --> 16:36.770
You realize you're a quokka,
don't you, quokka?

16:36.803 --> 16:38.605
Well, uh, yes.

16:38.638 --> 16:42.642
Look, this is the World's
Scariest Games, sweetheart.

16:42.674 --> 16:44.877
Some of us have trained
our whole lives to get here.

16:44.910 --> 16:47.546
And only the world's best
can compete.

16:47.579 --> 16:50.349
- She means her.
- She's the best!

16:50.382 --> 16:51.817
Um, I...

16:51.851 --> 16:54.621
You realize
you need a coach, right?

16:54.654 --> 16:59.625
No coach
is going to vouch for a quokka.

16:59.659 --> 17:01.827
You won't even be allowed
to try out.

17:01.861 --> 17:06.765
Oh! Well, maybe your coach
can be my coach, too?

17:06.798 --> 17:10.402
Why don't you just go
take some stupid selfies

17:10.436 --> 17:12.472
and do something
you're actually good at?

17:12.505 --> 17:14.841
In fact, here,
have one for free.

17:14.873 --> 17:16.543
Smile!

17:18.143 --> 17:19.412
Later, quokka.

17:21.514 --> 17:25.385
Well, what an extremely
unpleasant crocodile!

17:25.418 --> 17:27.587
Hey! Hey, you!

17:27.620 --> 17:30.122
You're one of those
smiley quokkas, right?

17:30.156 --> 17:31.358
Can we get a photo?

17:39.465 --> 17:42.401
That's what I'm here for.

17:43.870 --> 17:45.839
Yeah!

17:45.871 --> 17:47.841
Say quokka!

17:54.947 --> 17:57.150
- Say pizza!
- Quokka!

17:58.618 --> 17:59.953
Who's next?

18:24.544 --> 18:27.013
I'm sorry, Frankie. Ah!

18:27.045 --> 18:29.448
What the quokka?

18:31.484 --> 18:32.619
Drop bears?

18:36.656 --> 18:37.657
Whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa!

18:37.689 --> 18:39.993
Stop it. Get down from there!

18:40.025 --> 18:41.861
Well, this isn't for eating!

18:47.667 --> 18:50.602
Shoo! Shoo! Get out of there!

18:53.238 --> 18:55.975
That's my stuff!

18:56.007 --> 18:58.777
No! Get back here!

18:58.811 --> 19:01.848
Wait, wait!
You can play on the stand again.

19:01.880 --> 19:05.619
Come back! Come back!

19:12.257 --> 19:17.229
Drop bears, little drop bears.

19:17.263 --> 19:20.667
We can share some honey toast
if you like.

19:22.968 --> 19:24.736
It's okay, it's okay.

19:24.769 --> 19:27.539
It's probably just a sad wolf.

19:27.573 --> 19:30.776
Animals! You mongrels,
get out of here!

19:30.810 --> 19:33.580
- Huh?
- Shoo! Shoo!

19:33.612 --> 19:35.648
Won't you little monsters
leave me in peace?

19:35.680 --> 19:36.982
- Huh?
- Ah!

19:44.990 --> 19:46.792
Oi! Give that back!

19:46.825 --> 19:49.661
- No, no! Not in the swamp!
- Yuck!

19:49.695 --> 19:51.498
No, it... it can't be.

19:51.531 --> 19:53.733
Yeah! And stay out!

20:07.679 --> 20:10.115
Holy quokka,
it's Frankie Scales!

20:10.149 --> 20:13.852
Five-time WSG champion
and my personal hero.

20:13.886 --> 20:16.723
Rankie Scales?

20:16.755 --> 20:19.792
Hey there, little one.

20:19.824 --> 20:22.061
You do know who that is
down there, right?

20:22.093 --> 20:23.862
- No.
- What?

20:23.896 --> 20:25.765
That's Frankie Scales!

20:25.797 --> 20:28.667
Wait, w... w... wait. I have
something I prepared earlier.

20:28.700 --> 20:31.871
Oh, yes,
I finally get to use this.

20:31.903 --> 20:33.605
Lights.. Uh...

20:33.639 --> 20:36.109
Frankie Scales, a legend,

20:36.141 --> 20:39.312
the greatest athlete
the games had ever seen!

20:39.344 --> 20:41.780
<i>Mi amigo.</i>

20:41.813 --> 20:45.618
Was absolutely dominating
the WSG course.

20:45.650 --> 20:48.755
But all that changed during
the heated Fire Isles Finale

20:48.787 --> 20:51.623
where Frankie was against
his long-term rival,

20:51.657 --> 20:52.992
Jerry Whiskers!

20:53.025 --> 20:55.594
♪ Da-da-da ♪♪

20:57.630 --> 20:58.898
Me pretending to be Jerry.

20:58.930 --> 21:02.000
"You will not win again,
Frankie Scales!"

21:02.034 --> 21:04.637
And Frankie goes,
"Yeah, nah, mate, I will!

21:04.669 --> 21:08.041
"I'm just gonna go climb this
massive mountain now. See ya!"

21:08.073 --> 21:11.143
- Go, Rankie!
- But Jerry was catching up!

21:11.177 --> 21:13.880
Frankie and Jerry,
both high up on the mountain.

21:13.912 --> 21:17.883
And Frankie was like, unce,
unce, unce up the massive slope

21:17.917 --> 21:21.955
when suddenly Jerry
saw an opening, and whoosh,

21:21.987 --> 21:25.158
<i>tried to edge Frankie out.
Whack! Hyah!</i>

21:25.190 --> 21:29.161
Frankie tail-whips. Oh,
by accident, I'm pretty sure.

21:29.195 --> 21:31.197
Jerry falling. More falling.

21:31.229 --> 21:35.634
Ahh!

21:35.668 --> 21:36.803
Still falling,
it's really far down.

21:38.670 --> 21:40.974
<i>Horror, devastation, chaos,</i>

21:41.006 --> 21:43.008
<i>heartbreak, shook-ness!</i>

21:43.042 --> 21:45.778
The shook-ness
was too much to bear.

21:45.811 --> 21:48.814
I don't think I can go on
with the next part of the story.

21:48.848 --> 21:51.684
I can't, but I must!

21:51.717 --> 21:54.687
The aftermath!

21:54.719 --> 21:57.789
- Jerry's fate.
- Aye-oh, Jerry.

21:57.823 --> 22:01.127
- Yes, doctor.
- You will never walk again.

22:01.159 --> 22:04.229
No-o-o!

22:04.263 --> 22:09.002
Frankie's fate. The city that
once loved him turns on him!

22:09.034 --> 22:11.403
"You're a monster!"
"You're a cheat!"

22:11.437 --> 22:13.805
"I do declare you stinky!"

22:13.839 --> 22:15.975
Cut to...

22:16.007 --> 22:18.111
The games
turned on Frankie, too.

22:18.143 --> 22:21.880
His achievements erased,
forgotten, betrayed!

22:21.913 --> 22:25.017
- No!
- Yes, little one.

22:25.051 --> 22:28.788
Devastated by the injury he
caused to his respected rival,

22:28.821 --> 22:31.124
the shame was too much to bear,

22:31.157 --> 22:34.260
the great Frankie Scales left
the city that once loved him

22:34.293 --> 22:36.862
vowing to never return again.

22:36.896 --> 22:40.265
<i>His family, torn apart,
left behind.</i>

22:40.298 --> 22:42.868
- "No, papa!"
- Papa!

22:42.901 --> 22:44.871
And just like that he vanished.

22:44.903 --> 22:48.907
- No-o!
- Never to be seen again.

22:50.909 --> 22:54.013
Until now,
when Frankie reemerges

22:54.045 --> 22:56.882
in a glorious comeback
as the coach and best friend

22:56.916 --> 22:59.018
of Daisy Quokka!

23:00.852 --> 23:02.188
Oh, thank you.

23:02.220 --> 23:05.691
I'd like to thank
my mum and my dad.

23:05.725 --> 23:07.726
Aah! Oh!

23:11.863 --> 23:14.033
Ah!

23:14.065 --> 23:18.270
What is a quokka doing
lurking around my home?

23:18.303 --> 23:22.074
I wasn't lurking.
Um, I was loitering!

23:22.108 --> 23:24.844
That's even worse.

23:24.877 --> 23:28.047
I despise loitering.

23:29.814 --> 23:32.951
Now, you've got two seconds
to state your business

23:32.985 --> 23:37.122
before I make you my breakfast!

23:37.156 --> 23:40.860
Uh, but it's night time?

23:40.892 --> 23:44.796
Oh, I get up late.
I'm a night owl.

23:44.830 --> 23:46.999
But you're a crocodile.

23:47.032 --> 23:49.736
I'm not actually a night owl.

23:49.768 --> 23:51.236
You know what? Forget it!

23:51.269 --> 23:54.005
Ah, my name is Daisy Quokka
and I know you're Frankie Scales

23:54.038 --> 23:55.874
and I'm your number-one fan
and I'm looking to compete

23:55.908 --> 23:58.077
in the World's Scariest Games
held in Sanctuary City

23:58.110 --> 23:59.978
and I'd like you to be my coach.
Please don't eat me.

24:00.012 --> 24:01.080
Thank you for your time.

24:03.248 --> 24:06.752
The games are being held
in the city?

24:06.785 --> 24:09.956
Uh, yeah.
First time in 20 years.

24:10.956 --> 24:13.126
So you'll be my coach?

24:13.159 --> 24:15.061
Not in a million years, kid.

24:15.093 --> 24:17.095
But you're
the World's Scariest Animal!

24:17.129 --> 24:21.134
World's Scariest Animal!

24:21.167 --> 24:24.169
You wanna know where all the
world's scariest animals are?

24:24.203 --> 24:26.973
Right here, in the wild!

24:27.005 --> 24:28.975
- Wild!
- Oh, no!

24:30.008 --> 24:31.009
plop

24:31.043 --> 24:34.280
- Ugh!
- Oh.

24:34.313 --> 24:36.381
Please, Mr. Scales.

24:36.415 --> 24:39.118
I... I know
I don't look like much.

24:39.150 --> 24:42.822
What's a quokka
wanna enter the games for, huh?

24:42.854 --> 24:46.191
Well, it's been my dream
ever since I was little.

24:46.225 --> 24:48.895
- Your dream is to get killed?
- No!

24:48.928 --> 24:51.898
Well, I got news for ya,
you're gonna.

24:51.930 --> 24:53.865
I know I can do this!

24:53.899 --> 24:57.136
You realize you're a quokka,
don't you, quokka?

24:57.169 --> 24:59.938
Besides, why should I care?

24:59.971 --> 25:02.007
The games
turned their back on me

25:02.041 --> 25:04.844
and now I'm turning me back
on you.

25:07.278 --> 25:11.016
Um, I can still
see your snout.

25:11.050 --> 25:16.022
No, you can't.
I'm in stealth mode.

25:16.054 --> 25:19.324
Uh, yes, I can. Snout.

25:21.927 --> 25:26.332
Mr. Scales, you once said,
"Never give up on your dreams."

25:26.364 --> 25:29.935
I'm taking that advice to heart.

25:29.968 --> 25:32.904
Kid, life will be a lot easier

25:32.938 --> 25:37.209
if you just leave your dreams
where they belong. Trust me.

25:39.044 --> 25:43.149
Frankie,
I know you didn't mean to...

25:43.181 --> 25:46.118
You should come back.

25:48.353 --> 25:50.289
The city will forgive you.

25:53.892 --> 25:56.929
Nah, no one wants me back.

25:59.998 --> 26:03.001
Now, get out of here, kid,
before I get hungry.

26:05.905 --> 26:07.340
I guess
that Ronda girl was right.

26:07.372 --> 26:10.375
- Hm?
- I really am just a quokka.

26:12.210 --> 26:15.146
- You said Ronda?
- Oh, yeah.

26:15.179 --> 26:18.417
Word is she's the hot pick
to beat Drago this year.

26:18.449 --> 26:21.086
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

26:21.120 --> 26:24.323
And she's a mean crocodile, too,
just like you.

26:29.160 --> 26:32.130
You know what, uh,
I'm in a good mood today.

26:32.163 --> 26:36.167
- So I might just help you out.
- This is your good mood?

26:36.200 --> 26:40.672
And I'm gonna try and forget
the fact that you're a quokka.

26:40.706 --> 26:43.309
You won't ever
regret it, Mr. Scales.

26:43.342 --> 26:46.912
- Now, look, just listen to me.
- I promise I'll train so hard...

26:46.946 --> 26:49.215
Ah, this is a mistake already.

26:49.247 --> 26:52.017
- No, no! I'm listening, coach.
- Stop!

26:52.051 --> 26:53.218
If I'm gonna coach ya,
you're gonna...

26:53.252 --> 26:55.388
I won't let you down,
Mr. Scales.

26:56.522 --> 26:57.991
Uh..

26:59.425 --> 27:02.328
Whoo-hoo! Aha! Oh, yeah!

27:02.361 --> 27:05.264
- What? What are you doing?
- Oh. Dancing.

27:05.296 --> 27:07.265
♪ Mm mm yeah ooh ♪♪

27:07.298 --> 27:09.167
Please stop. Just cut it out.

27:09.200 --> 27:11.102
Aye-aye, captain!

27:15.040 --> 27:17.243
Over here! Come on, you lot!

27:19.445 --> 27:22.181
- A-ha!
- Ha-ha-ha...

27:22.214 --> 27:25.017
- Cool hat! Where'd you get it?
- Uh...

27:25.050 --> 27:28.220
One more word about my hat,
and I'm out of here.

27:28.253 --> 27:30.489
What? But it's a nice hat.

27:30.522 --> 27:33.159
I just never took you for
a hat kind of croc, you know?

27:33.191 --> 27:36.094
Maybe a scarf? Whoa!

27:39.765 --> 27:41.066
Whoa!

27:41.100 --> 27:43.468
Was it always this packed,
Frankie?

27:43.502 --> 27:46.038
- Frankie?
- Uh! Uh...

27:46.071 --> 27:48.140
Frankie,
is there something wrong?

27:48.172 --> 27:51.576
Ah, nothing, it's...
It's just, it's been a while.

27:51.610 --> 27:54.479
Oh, well then, let's go!

27:54.513 --> 27:56.549
Um, kid, maybe I shouldn't...

27:56.582 --> 27:58.551
- Francis Scales!
- Huh!

28:02.187 --> 28:03.222
Ah!

28:06.525 --> 28:08.526
Uh-oh.

28:08.560 --> 28:11.597
- Mm.
- Huh? Oh.

28:11.630 --> 28:14.332
Double uh-oh.

28:14.365 --> 28:15.500
Huh!

28:18.504 --> 28:21.173
I thought I'd seen
the last of you, quokka.

28:21.206 --> 28:23.542
- And you are?
- Uh, um, it's, it's Fran...

28:23.574 --> 28:26.344
- Did I ask you?
- No, but...

28:26.378 --> 28:28.547
Well then, who are ya?

28:28.580 --> 28:31.117
Uh, uh, Frankie Scales.

28:31.150 --> 28:34.419
I didn't think I'd ever see
your snout down here again.

28:34.453 --> 28:38.290
I don't wanna argue, Jerry, I'm
just here to support my athlete.

28:38.323 --> 28:41.159
A quokka?
I'm the head coach, pal.

28:41.192 --> 28:44.095
And your quokka's got no shot.

28:44.129 --> 28:47.198
Hopefully <i>she</i> only ends up
on the bench,

28:47.232 --> 28:50.136
not in a chair like me.

28:53.671 --> 28:55.607
Eeh! Ah!

28:59.143 --> 29:01.413
Today you're in a place

29:01.447 --> 29:04.550
where broken dreams
and bones are made,

29:04.582 --> 29:07.486
where it takes guts
and ferocity,

29:07.518 --> 29:11.323
a place
where smiles don't exist.

29:11.355 --> 29:13.491
Welcome to the try-outs

29:13.525 --> 29:17.063
for the World's Scariest Games!

29:17.095 --> 29:21.400
In order to qualify, you'll
need to conquer this course.

29:21.432 --> 29:23.568
♪ Da-da da-da ♪♪

29:23.601 --> 29:26.272
Would you look at that?

29:26.304 --> 29:29.174
Good grief! Hazaarr!

29:29.207 --> 29:30.508
Oh!

29:33.411 --> 29:36.215
- Yup!
- But be careful not to slip.

29:36.247 --> 29:41.086
Otherwise you'll end up
in the Pool of Disqualification.

29:43.488 --> 29:46.391
Which was never built!

29:46.425 --> 29:48.661
Damn budget cuts!

29:48.694 --> 29:52.098
Ah, anyway,
the top two fastest athletes,

29:52.130 --> 29:55.434
and only the top two,
will represent Sanctuary City

29:55.467 --> 29:57.335
at this year's games.

29:57.369 --> 30:01.372
Each one of you gets one shot
to make it to that buzzer.

30:01.406 --> 30:04.143
Only then will ya be considered.

30:04.176 --> 30:07.612
Alright then, let's get scary!

30:14.352 --> 30:17.422
- Knock-out!
- Ah, ah, ah!

30:17.456 --> 30:19.324
Out!

30:24.329 --> 30:26.265
Ah!

30:26.765 --> 30:28.601
Ah!

30:48.253 --> 30:50.755
Can I get a decent athlete
out here?

30:52.724 --> 30:54.592
Come on, this is embarrassing!

30:54.626 --> 30:55.728
Ahh!

30:58.663 --> 31:00.265
Ronda!

31:00.298 --> 31:02.167
Show 'em how it's done.

31:25.591 --> 31:27.293
- Huh!
- Wow!

31:39.571 --> 31:41.307
Whoo-hoo!

31:44.743 --> 31:46.812
Double whoa.

31:49.448 --> 31:50.649
Time!

31:53.384 --> 31:54.619
Wow!

31:54.652 --> 31:56.487
Yeah! Ronda,
loved her!

31:56.521 --> 31:59.291
Alright! That's what
I'm talkin' about.

31:59.323 --> 32:01.826
But I need two athletes
on my team!

32:01.860 --> 32:05.264
How about you, Dex Brown?

32:05.764 --> 32:07.699
Oi, Dex!

32:07.733 --> 32:09.501
One second. That's, that's me.

32:09.534 --> 32:11.370
I'll be right back.

32:13.471 --> 32:15.373
Bring it home, mate!

32:15.407 --> 32:19.378
Dex! Dex! Dex! Dex! Dex! Dex!

32:19.410 --> 32:21.647
Dex Brown!

32:23.814 --> 32:24.816
Zoom!

32:30.755 --> 32:33.758
- Ah!
- Whoo-hoo!

32:33.792 --> 32:35.526
On you, Dex!

32:35.560 --> 32:37.463
Dex! Dex! Dex! Dex!

32:37.496 --> 32:39.497
Me! Me! Me! Me!

32:39.531 --> 32:42.635
Dex! Dex! Dex! Dex! Dex! Dex!

32:45.570 --> 32:48.540
Dex! Dex! Dex! Dex! Dex! Dex!

32:48.573 --> 32:52.410
Right-o, I think that's
everyone, so let's go and get...

32:52.444 --> 32:54.580
Hey, what about me?

32:59.383 --> 33:01.620
Oh. Right.

33:01.652 --> 33:04.656
And last,
from the look of things

33:04.689 --> 33:08.559
probably least, Daisy Quokka.

33:08.592 --> 33:10.629
He said my name!

33:19.804 --> 33:22.507
- Ha-ha-ha!
- You scared, quokka?

33:22.541 --> 33:26.745
- Just give up!
- Why don't you smile, honey?

33:26.777 --> 33:28.747
Okay, you can do this.

33:31.615 --> 33:32.651
Hmph!

33:42.427 --> 33:44.429
Ah...

33:45.496 --> 33:46.631
Oh...

33:49.900 --> 33:51.803
Oh!

33:51.836 --> 33:55.106
Yup! Definitely least.

33:55.140 --> 33:59.477
Wait! Look over there!

33:59.511 --> 34:00.579
Mm?

34:08.720 --> 34:10.422
Huh?

34:10.454 --> 34:12.590
Huh. Hm.

34:21.465 --> 34:23.635
Yes! I did it! Huh?

34:25.604 --> 34:29.508
- Yoo-hoo!
- Ah... Okay.

34:29.541 --> 34:31.443
You could do this, Daisy.

34:41.753 --> 34:44.957
We have a new record

34:44.990 --> 34:49.794
for the slowest
completion time ever!

34:54.032 --> 34:55.834
Uh...

34:58.669 --> 35:01.807
Thank you to everyone who
tried out for this year's games.

35:01.840 --> 35:05.711
Unfortunately, we can't give
uniforms to all of you.

35:05.744 --> 35:10.182
In fact, pretty much all of you
will go home empty-handed.

35:10.215 --> 35:13.017
Uh, except for you, Tim.

35:13.050 --> 35:16.020
- Huh!
- That is, uh, that is gross.

35:19.724 --> 35:22.861
Having said that,
I'm proud to announce the two,

35:22.894 --> 35:26.631
and only two athletes
representing Sanctuary City

35:26.664 --> 35:29.968
at this year's
World's Scariest Games.

35:34.872 --> 35:36.775
Ronda Saltie!

35:36.807 --> 35:39.043
Saltie Ronda?

35:39.077 --> 35:41.880
Smashed it, mate!

35:41.912 --> 35:44.015
The second athlete is...

35:49.720 --> 35:51.556
Dex Brown.

35:51.590 --> 35:54.693
Whoo-hoo! Dex Brown!

35:56.827 --> 35:59.965
Nice one, Dexy! Bring it in!

35:59.997 --> 36:03.936
Sanctuary City!
Oi, Oi, Oi!

36:03.968 --> 36:06.804
Well done to this year's
scariest animals.

36:06.838 --> 36:08.941
Everyone else,
feel free to return home

36:08.974 --> 36:11.075
to your boring lives.

36:11.108 --> 36:14.579
Uh, excuse me,
Mr. Whiskers!

36:17.081 --> 36:18.816
Hey, hey, you,
you're slowing down!

36:18.849 --> 36:20.452
Keep, keep up.

36:22.720 --> 36:24.923
That's Augustus Maximus.

36:24.956 --> 36:28.026
He is the president
of the games.

36:28.059 --> 36:29.595
Wow!

36:33.731 --> 36:36.267
This cocky cockie
is not the second member

36:36.300 --> 36:38.636
of the Sanctuary City team.

36:39.970 --> 36:42.640
Uh, are you for real, mate?

36:42.673 --> 36:43.941
Why don't you just focus on

36:43.974 --> 36:46.277
your little paperwork there,
okay, buddy?

36:46.311 --> 36:50.015
Then perhaps you're familiar
with <i>this</i> paperwork?

36:52.150 --> 36:55.686
The Scariest Games rulebook
states that the team selections

36:55.720 --> 36:58.590
are based
on the fastest completion time

36:58.622 --> 37:02.628
only by athletes
who have hit the buzzer.

37:02.660 --> 37:06.097
Mr. Brown right here
did not hit the buzzer,

37:06.131 --> 37:09.668
and, therefore,
he did not complete the course,

37:09.700 --> 37:13.905
and, therefore,
he does not qualify.

37:18.075 --> 37:21.847
Oh, come on!
That's a technicality.

37:21.880 --> 37:24.650
He's way better
than the rest of these wannabes.

37:24.682 --> 37:29.021
That may very well be true,
but rules are rules.

37:29.053 --> 37:31.822
As much as it pains me
to say this,

37:31.856 --> 37:35.694
the only other athlete
to hit the buzzer was

37:35.727 --> 37:37.329
Daisy Quokka.

37:43.367 --> 37:45.736
That's, that's me?

37:45.769 --> 37:47.139
That's my name!

37:47.171 --> 37:48.974
- Ugh!
- What?

37:49.006 --> 37:51.976
What? No... no Dex Brown?

37:52.010 --> 37:53.712
Whoo-hoo!

37:59.950 --> 38:03.220
Frankie!

38:03.253 --> 38:04.922
Daisy!

38:04.956 --> 38:07.124
Frankie!

38:07.157 --> 38:09.694
- Yay! Whoo-hoo!
- What are you doing?

38:09.727 --> 38:14.066
Oh. I thought you'd maybe lift
me triumphantly into the air.

38:14.099 --> 38:16.802
- Seemed like the moment for it.
- Well, I mean, I can.

38:16.834 --> 38:20.072
But it'd be a little bit weird
now, wouldn't it?

38:20.104 --> 38:21.907
Yeah, I'd, I'd like that.

38:24.843 --> 38:29.381
Daisy! Daisy? Daisy.

38:29.414 --> 38:30.948
I think we're done here.

38:40.124 --> 38:41.860
Wow!

38:46.264 --> 38:49.166
Welcome to the team, quokka.

38:49.200 --> 38:52.204
Oh, hey, Jerry,
I'm ready to start training.

38:52.236 --> 38:56.207
This jersey used to mean
something to this city.

38:56.240 --> 38:59.710
Well, not anymore.
Wanna know why?

38:59.744 --> 39:02.847
Because it's being worn
by a tiny quokka

39:02.881 --> 39:05.684
who has no business being here.

39:05.717 --> 39:07.985
Try not to embarrass
our entire city,

39:08.019 --> 39:10.089
hey, ankle-biter.

39:36.046 --> 39:40.686
Coming to you live
once again from Sanctuary City!

39:40.718 --> 39:42.720
Hello and welcome,
I'm your host,

39:42.753 --> 39:44.922
the dashingly good-looking
Flightless Feather.

39:44.956 --> 39:47.191
And joining me
in the commentary booth

39:47.224 --> 39:51.028
is the world's cutest co-host,
Bernard the Drop Bear.

39:53.497 --> 39:55.700
How excited are we, Bernie?

39:55.733 --> 39:58.035
Ah!

39:58.068 --> 39:59.771
Couldn't have said it better
myself!

39:59.803 --> 40:03.075
In fact, show us
what we've got in store, Bernie.

40:03.108 --> 40:05.711
Four terror-tories
from across the globe

40:05.744 --> 40:08.313
in competition this year,
five athletes in total.

40:08.345 --> 40:10.782
Each game commences
with a deadly obstacle course

40:10.814 --> 40:15.052
rising from beneath
the arena floor, unknown to all.

40:15.086 --> 40:17.322
Each round, the athlete who hits
that glorious red buzzer

40:17.354 --> 40:19.791
in the fastest time
wins the points,

40:19.823 --> 40:21.892
adding
to their leaderboard tally.

40:24.128 --> 40:25.730
That's right,
Bernie, the two athletes

40:25.764 --> 40:26.832
with the highest points tally

40:26.865 --> 40:28.233
will face off in the finale

40:28.265 --> 40:33.070
to be crowned
the World's Scariest Animal!

40:33.104 --> 40:36.207
We are mere seconds away
from meeting our warriors.

40:36.240 --> 40:37.508
Are you ready, Bernie?

40:39.043 --> 40:40.845
Let's cross over to the arena.

40:44.983 --> 40:48.186
Listen up, Ronda,
this is your moment.

40:48.218 --> 40:49.987
Don't engage the other teams
during...

40:50.021 --> 40:51.990
Any words of wisdom, coach?

40:52.023 --> 40:54.325
Hm. Just don't die out there.

40:54.358 --> 40:57.194
I can't have that
on me conscience.

41:06.236 --> 41:09.240
Please take your
seats for the opening ceremony,

41:09.273 --> 41:11.242
brought to you by Bushbars!

41:11.276 --> 41:13.945
Mm! Love those Bushbars!

41:13.977 --> 41:16.313
Please welcome Yarra!

41:47.177 --> 41:48.380
Head up.

41:55.919 --> 41:57.155
Here we go.

41:57.188 --> 41:59.925
Ladies
and gentle-mammals,

41:59.957 --> 42:03.128
please welcome
the scariest animals

42:03.160 --> 42:05.963
from across the globe!

42:07.465 --> 42:10.135
Whoa!

42:10.168 --> 42:12.838
And here they are,
the hosting city's athletes,

42:12.871 --> 42:15.240
Team Sanctuary City!

42:22.113 --> 42:24.216
There she is,
our big hope

42:24.249 --> 42:27.886
to challenge Drago Modo,
Ronda Saltie!

42:31.488 --> 42:34.860
And her fellow competitor
Daisy Quokka.

42:34.892 --> 42:36.927
- Who is, uh, she w... well...
- Quokka!

42:36.961 --> 42:39.064
- She's a quokka!
- A quokka.

42:39.097 --> 42:42.066
- What? A quokka?
- Ah!

42:47.671 --> 42:50.307
- Roll, roll, roll, roll.
- Honey.

42:50.340 --> 42:52.877
I'm trying to call Daisy's line,
but she's not picking up.

42:52.910 --> 42:56.081
She'll be fine,
she's probably too busy

42:56.113 --> 42:59.117
taking smiley selfies
to get to the phone.

42:59.150 --> 43:02.086
...and Daisy Quokka,
our second competitor

43:02.119 --> 43:04.088
from Sanctuary City.

43:04.122 --> 43:06.957
Or she's competing

43:06.990 --> 43:10.160
in the most dangerous sport
on the planet!

43:19.303 --> 43:21.006
And from the corners
of the Earth,

43:21.039 --> 43:23.140
it's time to kick some ice

43:23.173 --> 43:25.142
with New Winterland!

43:28.246 --> 43:31.515
Represented by Tyrus Polar!

43:31.548 --> 43:34.485
Next up, Savannah Kingdom!

43:36.186 --> 43:38.422
This is Adewale Khan,

43:38.456 --> 43:41.959
king of the Kingdom.

43:41.992 --> 43:45.396
And finally, home of the current
World's Scariest champion,

43:45.430 --> 43:47.399
the raging, the blazing,

43:47.432 --> 43:51.202
the one and only Fire Isle!

43:54.439 --> 43:58.076
The World's Scariest Animal,

43:58.108 --> 44:00.344
Drago Modo!

44:08.385 --> 44:10.088
Drago.

44:14.559 --> 44:17.361
Sha-wow-za!

44:17.394 --> 44:20.532
What a ceremony, Bernie!
I... it had everything.

44:20.564 --> 44:23.334
Here we are,
the first challenge!

44:23.367 --> 44:24.568
Let's see what Mother Nature

44:24.602 --> 44:26.972
will be throwing
at our athletes tonight.

44:29.773 --> 44:32.409
What are you doing?

44:32.443 --> 44:37.015
It's actually Drago Modo!
The Drago.

44:37.048 --> 44:40.552
He's won the WSG title
four times in a row!

44:40.584 --> 44:43.387
And he'll win again
if you don't let me focus!

44:43.421 --> 44:45.390
Frankie once said,
"There's nothing wrong

44:45.423 --> 44:47.359
with a bit of sportsmanship."

44:47.392 --> 44:49.327
Ooh! I gotta go shake hands.

44:49.360 --> 44:52.296
- Daisy, wait! No!
- Mr. Modo.

44:52.329 --> 44:53.564
It's a pleasure
competing with you in th...

44:53.597 --> 44:56.534
- Ah!
- Ah!

44:59.436 --> 45:03.607
Replay!
Ooh! That's gonna hurt!

45:03.640 --> 45:06.510
Oof!
That's a little embarrassing.

45:08.246 --> 45:10.081
Huh?

45:10.113 --> 45:11.983
Do you feel that, Ronda?

45:13.251 --> 45:15.220
Uh, Ronda?

45:20.323 --> 45:22.494
Ah! I get it.

45:22.526 --> 45:27.298
Wait!

45:27.331 --> 45:29.566
Competitors,
on your marks!

45:29.599 --> 45:32.569
Ronda!

45:32.602 --> 45:34.206
Get set!

45:35.305 --> 45:36.441
Stupid quokka!

45:45.416 --> 45:48.419
Alrighty then. Let's get scary!

45:56.693 --> 45:58.563
And we're live, folks!

45:59.664 --> 46:02.400
Oh, wow, The First Wish, known

46:02.432 --> 46:06.403
as one of the most terrifying
courses in WSG history!

46:06.436 --> 46:09.640
W... what a way
to kick off these games!!

46:23.553 --> 46:25.289
Whoo-hoo!

46:29.494 --> 46:31.162
Come on, Ronda!

46:31.195 --> 46:32.630
Just look
at Ronda Saltie go!

46:32.662 --> 46:35.432
She is cruising ahead
for Sanctuary City!

46:35.465 --> 46:37.634
Outstanding start
by this young athlete.

46:44.608 --> 46:46.244
Here the athletes come, folks!

46:46.276 --> 46:48.378
Drago, Ronda, Tyrus, Adewale,

46:48.412 --> 46:50.215
all storming up the course.

46:50.247 --> 46:53.584
Daisy Quokka
now trailing terribly behind.

46:53.617 --> 46:57.421
W... wait.
Is that all you've got, huh?

47:10.334 --> 47:11.703
Our little quokka
has stepped on

47:11.735 --> 47:14.671
one of many booby traps
riddled throughout the course.

47:14.704 --> 47:16.707
You know, she's an odd choice
for the games, Bernie.

47:16.740 --> 47:20.144
Not exactly what comes to mind
when you think scary.

47:21.512 --> 47:23.215
Come on, kid, get up!

48:03.521 --> 48:05.289
Look out!

48:19.669 --> 48:22.173
Go home, quokka!

48:32.749 --> 48:35.219
No!

49:07.617 --> 49:11.456
Go, Daisy!
Don't let fear take over you!

49:16.559 --> 49:17.628
Ah!

49:23.434 --> 49:24.836
- Ronda?
- Daisy!

49:32.376 --> 49:34.611
What are you doing? Get off me!

49:34.644 --> 49:37.414
Ronda, please!

49:37.447 --> 49:41.752
Help me! Please!

49:52.563 --> 49:55.365
Ah, you stupid quokka!

50:19.889 --> 50:24.094
Ronda, I'm, I'm so sorry.

50:24.128 --> 50:25.595
- I... I...
- Urgh!

50:25.628 --> 50:27.364
We might be wearing
the same colors,

50:27.398 --> 50:29.633
but it's every animal
for themselves in the arena.

50:31.702 --> 50:34.405
Quit now
before you hurt yourself

50:34.438 --> 50:37.374
or, worse, someone else.

50:43.847 --> 50:45.615
Tonight
was utter mayhem, Bernie.

50:45.648 --> 50:48.418
Here is how the leaderboard
stands after round one.

50:48.452 --> 50:51.389
The favorite, Drago, firmly
at the top of the ladder,

50:51.421 --> 50:52.923
taking home top points.

50:52.956 --> 50:55.926
Sanctuary City fans,
look away now as your athletes,

50:55.959 --> 50:59.429
Ronda and Daisy,
are rooted firmly to the bottom.

50:59.463 --> 51:02.867
Is there any way back
for this croc and quok?

51:09.874 --> 51:13.477
- Hello?
- Hey, dad, it's me.

51:13.510 --> 51:15.579
Honey! Honey, it's Daisy!

51:15.613 --> 51:18.883
- Honey! Honey, it's mum.
- Hi, mum.

51:18.916 --> 51:20.918
Are you okay, honey?
Are you alive?

51:20.950 --> 51:22.887
We just saw you on the TV,
kiddo.

51:22.919 --> 51:25.155
That was really scary
for us.

51:25.189 --> 51:28.159
- You nearly died.
- And you weren't smiling!

51:28.191 --> 51:31.661
Tell her,
I couldn't see her smiling!

51:31.695 --> 51:33.463
Anyway, your mother and I, well,

51:33.497 --> 51:36.601
we're just so glad
that you lost the games

51:36.633 --> 51:38.168
and you're coming home, honey.

51:38.202 --> 51:40.604
A quick game's a good game, hey?

51:40.637 --> 51:42.639
- You tried.
- W... what?

51:42.673 --> 51:44.508
I'm still in the games!

51:44.541 --> 51:46.610
I'm just at the bottom
of the ladder.

51:46.644 --> 51:50.848
- Oh, but you were terrible!
- So terrible, honey.

51:50.881 --> 51:52.950
Like the terriblest thing
ever!

51:52.983 --> 51:56.888
And, kiddo, you're supposed
to be the face of Quokka Rocks.

51:56.921 --> 51:58.756
Promoting the island!

51:58.789 --> 52:01.993
Doing anything but competing
in the World's Scariest Games.

52:02.026 --> 52:05.897
It's not what quokkas do!
You know this!

52:05.930 --> 52:08.966
Maybe you should
come home now.

52:08.999 --> 52:11.769
We think
y... you're not quite ready

52:11.802 --> 52:15.206
to be the face of Quokka Rocks,
at least not yet.

52:15.238 --> 52:18.543
Honey, would they let you leave
if I wrote you a note?

52:18.575 --> 52:20.043
They don't write notes anymore,
hon.

52:20.077 --> 52:22.580
They just quit!
It's what kids do these days.

52:22.613 --> 52:24.816
- It's totally acceptable.
- Acceptable?

52:24.849 --> 52:26.784
That would never have
happened back in our day.

52:26.816 --> 52:29.621
I know, hon.
Times are changing!

52:36.260 --> 52:38.729
Oh. Uh, hi.

52:38.762 --> 52:40.798
- Hey.
- Uh...

52:40.831 --> 52:43.767
- Close call tonight, right?
- It was.

52:43.800 --> 52:45.802
But that's the games.

52:45.836 --> 52:48.738
Well, uh, I'm glad you're safe.

52:48.771 --> 52:51.775
- And... and... and Daisy, too.
- Thanks.

52:57.581 --> 52:59.818
Uh... Mm!

53:01.584 --> 53:02.919
Hey, um, you know,

53:02.952 --> 53:05.989
I... I checked out
some of your old tapes.

53:06.023 --> 53:08.793
You were alright
back in the day.

53:08.825 --> 53:10.961
Oh, thanks, kid.

53:12.128 --> 53:14.664
- Uh, Ronda, I...
- Oi!

53:14.697 --> 53:17.701
If you're looking for the kid,
she's not here anymore.

53:25.575 --> 53:26.711
What?

53:30.747 --> 53:32.015
When did she leave?

53:32.048 --> 53:35.986
Right after she nearly got
my athlete killed.

53:36.019 --> 53:38.855
Time to pack your bags, Frankie.

53:43.727 --> 53:45.062
All aboard!

54:02.146 --> 54:03.648
Ah...

54:16.994 --> 54:20.631
Daisy, you can't quit.

54:20.664 --> 54:23.633
Not now. You've come too far!

54:23.666 --> 54:27.804
Look, I don't belong here.
You know it and I know it.

54:30.907 --> 54:33.643
What happened to the quokka
I first met, eh?

54:33.677 --> 54:36.646
Tenacious, determined,

54:36.680 --> 54:38.983
following her dreams.

54:39.015 --> 54:43.019
But look at you now. Running
away because you're scared?

54:43.052 --> 54:44.955
Of course I'm scared!

54:44.988 --> 54:47.891
I'm scared
because I just almost died!

54:52.095 --> 54:56.733
But I could never be as scared
as I am having to go back home,

54:56.767 --> 54:58.769
having to live out
an ordinary life,

54:58.802 --> 55:00.371
doing a job that's forced on me

55:00.403 --> 55:02.039
because of who I am
on the outside

55:02.072 --> 55:05.142
rather than
who I am on the inside.

55:05.175 --> 55:06.943
I'm scared of living out my life

55:06.977 --> 55:08.946
knowing that
my dreams passed me by

55:08.979 --> 55:11.115
and I didn't even try!

55:14.651 --> 55:16.686
Then stay.

55:16.720 --> 55:18.889
Why do you even want me to stay?

55:18.921 --> 55:21.758
You never believed
I could do this.

55:21.791 --> 55:24.828
- If you leave...
- If I leave, what?

55:24.861 --> 55:27.164
You'll regret it
for the rest of your life.

55:27.197 --> 55:30.800
- Trust me.
- Seriously!

55:30.834 --> 55:32.102
How are you going to turn me

55:32.135 --> 55:33.970
into the World's
Scariest Animal?

55:34.003 --> 55:37.842
Huh, uh, ah, I don't know
if I can train you well enough

55:37.874 --> 55:40.911
to survive, kid, let alone win.

55:43.079 --> 55:44.848
I guess you were right.

55:44.881 --> 55:49.019
My dream was meant to be
just that, a dream.

55:53.289 --> 55:54.691
Uh...

55:56.927 --> 55:59.997
I used to love coming here
when I was young.

56:00.030 --> 56:01.798
Runnin' around with my friends,

56:01.831 --> 56:04.801
playing pretend
World's Scariest Games.

56:05.269 --> 56:06.871
Really?

56:06.903 --> 56:10.807
I used to do that, too,
back on Quokka Rocks.

56:10.840 --> 56:14.077
You mustn't have been very good.

56:14.110 --> 56:15.178
Why is that?

56:15.211 --> 56:17.148
'Cause you're lying in lava

56:17.180 --> 56:19.082
right now!

56:19.115 --> 56:22.052
You played
the floor is lava, too?

56:22.086 --> 56:24.689
Yes,
of course, Daisy.

56:24.722 --> 56:27.691
Everyone did,
even old farts like me.

56:27.724 --> 56:30.727
You know what, bet you can't
beat me to that slide.

56:30.760 --> 56:35.265
Oh, you are so on!

56:35.298 --> 56:38.902
Watch out
for that lava up ahead!

56:38.936 --> 56:40.938
You burned your foot!

56:46.008 --> 56:49.179
Daisy Quokka
races towards the Leap of Faith.

56:49.213 --> 56:51.481
Can she make it?

56:56.086 --> 56:59.189
- Yay!
- Winner! Whoo-hoo!

57:01.291 --> 57:04.260
Daisy, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

57:04.293 --> 57:06.496
This whole time
I didn't believe in you

57:06.530 --> 57:10.066
because you're not scary at all!

57:10.099 --> 57:12.068
You already told me I suck,
Frankie.

57:12.102 --> 57:14.071
No, no, no, what I mean is, uh,

57:14.104 --> 57:17.742
out here, you've got skills.
Why is that?

57:17.775 --> 57:21.111
I don't know. I, we were just
playing around, I guess.

57:21.144 --> 57:25.181
Exactly.
You were just being you!

57:25.215 --> 57:27.952
Don't you see, kid, you don't
need to be the scariest

57:27.985 --> 57:31.021
in the arena,
the biggest and the baddest.

57:31.053 --> 57:34.525
You just need to be you,
a quokka.

57:34.557 --> 57:38.862
- Don't try and be anyone else.
- Oh, I don't know, Frankie.

57:38.896 --> 57:41.164
I mean,
this is just the playground.

57:41.197 --> 57:44.968
- It's not like the arena.
- Oh, but it is.

57:45.001 --> 57:47.337
Look, the gap you just cleared

57:47.371 --> 57:51.242
is longer than the one you faced
in the first game.

57:51.275 --> 57:54.244
So, now that I know
how to train you,

57:54.278 --> 57:58.015
the only question is,
are you ready to win?

57:59.950 --> 58:01.986
I'm ready!

58:02.019 --> 58:04.955
- Uh...
- Ah!

58:04.988 --> 58:08.058
- Hey, what's this?
- Training wheels.

58:08.090 --> 58:10.794
I don't need training wheels.

58:10.827 --> 58:12.295
We'll see.

58:19.202 --> 58:21.572
See, training wheels.

58:21.604 --> 58:26.376
Next up, you must swing across
the ocean of sharks!

58:31.981 --> 58:34.384
Ah!

58:35.619 --> 58:37.255
Argh!

58:47.898 --> 58:50.367
- Again!
- Ah.

58:50.400 --> 58:52.602
- Again!
- Ah!

58:52.635 --> 58:55.605
Again! Again!

58:55.639 --> 58:58.209
Again! Again! Again!

59:19.128 --> 59:22.065
Whoo-hoo!

59:22.099 --> 59:25.202
Uh! Yes! Whoo-hoo!

59:25.235 --> 59:26.269
Again!

59:30.474 --> 59:32.309
Go, Daisy! Go!

59:47.291 --> 59:49.325
Sit up straight.
We're gonna talk about diet.

59:49.358 --> 59:51.261
Quinoa, sushi.

59:53.162 --> 59:55.365
You've got to be strong.

59:55.398 --> 59:57.400
You've got to be tough!

59:57.434 --> 1:00:01.505
But most of all,
you've gotta have fun with it!

1:00:18.988 --> 1:00:20.990
There they are,
the city's dynamic duo!

1:00:21.023 --> 1:00:24.694
And what an incredible rise
it's been for Daisy Quokka.

1:00:24.727 --> 1:00:27.063
Zero to hero!

1:00:27.097 --> 1:00:29.400
Wow! Daisy!

1:00:29.432 --> 1:00:31.200
Forget walking
on water,

1:00:31.233 --> 1:00:34.404
Daisy Quokka is absolutely
flying across it tonight.

1:00:36.539 --> 1:00:39.342
Mm, get your merch!
Get your new merch!

1:00:39.376 --> 1:00:43.414
New merch from the one and only
Daisy Quokka!

1:01:07.470 --> 1:01:09.039
Hmph!

1:01:22.052 --> 1:01:25.122
Drago Modo
slamming his way into the final.

1:01:25.155 --> 1:01:27.758
But what's this? Daisy and Ronda
racing for that last spot!

1:01:27.791 --> 1:01:29.459
Who will it be?

1:01:32.496 --> 1:01:34.564
All of us
on the edge of our seats.

1:01:42.104 --> 1:01:46.342
I can't believe it!
Daisy is taking the lead!

1:01:46.376 --> 1:01:48.245
Come on, kid!

1:02:05.695 --> 1:02:07.363
And she has done it!

1:02:07.396 --> 1:02:11.101
Daisy Quokka has done it!

1:02:11.133 --> 1:02:14.470
- Yay, yeah, yeah!
- Daisy, Daisy!

1:02:14.503 --> 1:02:17.240
Yes! There you go!

1:02:17.273 --> 1:02:20.309
Now go, go, go!
Yeah, good on ya, Daisy!

1:02:33.155 --> 1:02:36.159
I simply cannot believe it!

1:02:36.193 --> 1:02:37.628
What a result, folks!

1:02:37.660 --> 1:02:41.231
Daisy Quokka to face
Drago Modo in the final!

1:02:41.264 --> 1:02:43.367
Yay! Daisy!

1:02:46.168 --> 1:02:49.272
- Daisy! Daisy! Daisy!
- Daisy! Daisy! Daisy!

1:02:49.305 --> 1:02:50.673
- Daisy! Daisy!
- Whoo-hoo!

1:02:50.706 --> 1:02:52.842
Yeah, yeah! Yes!

1:02:52.876 --> 1:02:55.345
I'm still picturing the look
on Drago's face

1:02:55.378 --> 1:02:57.081
when you hit that buzzer.

1:02:57.113 --> 1:03:01.418
Yeah, it was gold!

1:03:01.450 --> 1:03:04.353
I can't believe it, kid,
you made it!

1:03:04.387 --> 1:03:06.523
- The finals!
- The finals!

1:03:08.557 --> 1:03:10.293
Alright, just a light cool down
tonight.

1:03:10.327 --> 1:03:12.563
You got a very big day tomorrow.

1:03:12.595 --> 1:03:16.365
The day you've been dreaming
about your entire life.

1:03:16.398 --> 1:03:18.668
Wow! No pressure, hey?

1:03:18.702 --> 1:03:20.637
I'm proud of you, kid.

1:03:20.669 --> 1:03:22.606
And I'm sorry I didn't see it
to start with,

1:03:22.639 --> 1:03:26.376
but you are a true athlete.

1:03:36.485 --> 1:03:41.124
- Uh, coach, you okay?
- Um, yeah. Yeah.

1:03:41.157 --> 1:03:44.260
I'm just a bit tired
from all the cheering, you know?

1:03:46.363 --> 1:03:49.666
You're thinking about her again,
aren't you?

1:03:49.698 --> 1:03:52.702
Huh! What?
Why would you say that?

1:03:52.735 --> 1:03:57.373
Frankie,
I know Ronda's your daughter.

1:03:57.407 --> 1:04:00.244
Wait, what, uh...
How'd you know that?

1:04:03.246 --> 1:04:05.515
You knew from the start,
didn't ya?

1:04:11.253 --> 1:04:13.489
Yeah. I knew.

1:04:13.523 --> 1:04:16.160
I know everything
about you, Frankie.

1:04:16.193 --> 1:04:20.697
Your moves, your history,
your catch phrases.

1:04:20.729 --> 1:04:25.168
And as soon as I saw Ronda,
I saw so much of you in her.

1:04:25.202 --> 1:04:27.404
Your abilities, your strengths.

1:04:27.436 --> 1:04:29.539
Though she might even be
a little better than you.

1:04:33.309 --> 1:04:34.510
- Daisy, I...
- And...

1:04:34.543 --> 1:04:37.280
Why else would you agree
to coach me...

1:04:38.381 --> 1:04:39.517
a quokka?

1:04:41.483 --> 1:04:43.319
You wanted to see her.

1:04:48.425 --> 1:04:51.662
Look, uh, kid, these games,

1:04:51.695 --> 1:04:54.430
they were the only thing
I was ever good at.

1:04:56.666 --> 1:05:01.338
And after they took it all away
from me, I was lost.

1:05:01.371 --> 1:05:03.673
I didn't want Ronda
to resent me as a father

1:05:03.706 --> 1:05:06.609
like the rest of the city did.

1:05:06.642 --> 1:05:09.979
I thought it would be easier
if I just pretended

1:05:10.012 --> 1:05:11.614
I never existed.

1:05:14.316 --> 1:05:17.753
Oh, Frankie, that's no excuse,

1:05:17.787 --> 1:05:21.992
but you should be
telling her this, not me.

1:05:22.025 --> 1:05:24.695
You need to talk to her.

1:05:24.727 --> 1:05:28.698
Ah, no, I wouldn't even know
where to begin.

1:05:28.731 --> 1:05:31.467
When I met you, I thought
this could be my chance

1:05:31.501 --> 1:05:34.705
to see her again, and I did.
And I...

1:05:34.738 --> 1:05:38.308
I just don't want her
to hate me.

1:05:38.340 --> 1:05:40.676
Frankie, talk to her.

1:05:40.709 --> 1:05:44.414
You just have to show her
you still care.

1:05:44.447 --> 1:05:46.316
Yeah, I know.

1:05:46.349 --> 1:05:49.253
I guess you hate me now, too,
huh?

1:05:49.285 --> 1:05:50.787
Nah.

1:05:50.820 --> 1:05:53.624
Life is too amazing
to have hate in my heart.

1:05:56.526 --> 1:05:57.728
You know what?

1:05:57.760 --> 1:06:01.331
You really are special,
Daisy Quokka.

1:06:01.363 --> 1:06:03.733
Yeah, I know.

1:06:03.767 --> 1:06:07.303
Let's go, kid.
We've got a big day tomorrow!

1:06:07.336 --> 1:06:11.742
- The final! Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo-hoo! The final!

1:06:17.747 --> 1:06:18.749
What?

1:06:24.753 --> 1:06:27.757
This is it, folks. The big show.

1:06:27.791 --> 1:06:29.660
Daisy, the little quokka
that could

1:06:29.693 --> 1:06:33.397
up against the reigning champion
Drago Modo!

1:06:51.548 --> 1:06:54.685
You didn't think we'd let you
walk out there alone, did ya?

1:06:55.885 --> 1:06:57.821
I'm proud of you, quokka.

1:06:59.856 --> 1:07:02.392
Now go win this for us.

1:07:07.630 --> 1:07:09.832
You've got this, Daisy Quokka.

1:07:16.405 --> 1:07:18.741
Competing
in the World's

1:07:18.775 --> 1:07:22.412
Scariest Games championship,

1:07:22.445 --> 1:07:26.515
hailing from Sanctuary City,

1:07:26.548 --> 1:07:29.919
Daisy Quokka!

1:07:32.856 --> 1:07:34.624
Daisy!

1:07:36.559 --> 1:07:40.831
This is a dream come true!

1:07:42.599 --> 1:07:45.535
Oh, no! Not again!

1:07:58.847 --> 1:08:00.683
And her opponent,

1:08:00.717 --> 1:08:03.753
a dragon that needs
no introduction,

1:08:03.787 --> 1:08:07.724
Drago Modo!

1:08:34.983 --> 1:08:38.521
My golly gosh,
he is scary!

1:08:48.031 --> 1:08:50.734
Good luck to you.

1:08:50.767 --> 1:08:54.504
Luck is the currency
of the weak.

1:08:54.536 --> 1:08:57.973
Well, unluckily for you,
I'm totally prepared to...

1:08:59.075 --> 1:09:01.678
Athletes, to the sidelines.

1:09:01.710 --> 1:09:05.048
Oh! What? But I didn't get
to finish my comeback.

1:09:05.080 --> 1:09:08.851
Go on, quokka.
I'll give you a head start.

1:09:32.575 --> 1:09:33.677
Okay.

1:09:33.710 --> 1:09:37.547
The floor is literally lava.

1:09:37.580 --> 1:09:39.549
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

1:09:39.581 --> 1:09:42.852
The floor is freaking lava!

1:09:42.885 --> 1:09:46.856
Hot dang, Bernie!
What a fire-nale this will be!

1:09:49.058 --> 1:09:51.028
Daisy Quokka, ready?

1:09:52.562 --> 1:09:54.698
Drago Modo, ready?

1:09:55.999 --> 1:09:57.968
Then here we go!

1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:01.537
- Three!
- Go, Daisy!

1:10:01.571 --> 1:10:03.840
- Two!
- Come on, Daisy!

1:10:03.872 --> 1:10:06.043
- Come on!
- One!

1:10:10.079 --> 1:10:11.648
Go!

1:10:13.049 --> 1:10:15.852
- And they're off.
- Daisy!

1:10:15.884 --> 1:10:18.921
It's just a hot day
on the beach.

1:10:18.955 --> 1:10:20.991
Just a hot day on the beach!

1:10:31.834 --> 1:10:33.870
Mm!

1:10:33.902 --> 1:10:38.040
Give up, quokka. You'll always
be chasing my tail.

1:10:46.883 --> 1:10:49.019
Dang it, the king of the course

1:10:49.052 --> 1:10:51.088
is not happy about that.

1:10:52.054 --> 1:10:53.923
Ah!

1:10:53.956 --> 1:10:55.892
Daisy Quokka
chasing down the champ!

1:10:55.924 --> 1:10:58.628
Not letting the heat get to her.

1:10:58.661 --> 1:11:02.566
Back to Drago, gearing up
for the Lava Falls runway.

1:11:05.034 --> 1:11:07.771
Shut up! Whoa!

1:11:07.804 --> 1:11:10.807
A lava waterfall?
That is so rad.

1:11:10.839 --> 1:11:12.909
What kind of genius
comes up with this stuff?

1:11:41.004 --> 1:11:43.673
Wait! Down there!

1:11:51.848 --> 1:11:55.986
- Ah!
- Urgh! Get off! Ooh.

1:11:56.018 --> 1:11:58.988
Ooh! She is on fire!

1:12:13.870 --> 1:12:16.607
Go on.
I'll give you a head start.

1:12:28.017 --> 1:12:29.620
Oh, no!

1:12:41.997 --> 1:12:44.735
Come on, Daisy! Come on!

1:13:01.718 --> 1:13:06.055
Yes! Come on, Daisy!
You can win this thing!

1:13:06.089 --> 1:13:07.823
You're my hero!

1:13:17.066 --> 1:13:19.469
Daisy's making
her move! This is incredible!

1:13:19.501 --> 1:13:20.937
- Yay!
- Yes!

1:13:26.742 --> 1:13:29.278
Daisy Quokka
moments away from becoming

1:13:29.312 --> 1:13:32.115
the new World's Scariest Animal!

1:13:35.951 --> 1:13:38.253
I can't believe it!
T... this is incredible!

1:13:38.286 --> 1:13:39.822
I can't believe it!

1:13:58.775 --> 1:14:00.009
Oh, no!

1:14:06.549 --> 1:14:08.084
Oh, no!
What's happening?

1:14:08.116 --> 1:14:10.052
Drago is officially
out of control!

1:14:11.219 --> 1:14:12.354
Oh, no!

1:14:17.259 --> 1:14:18.861
Drago!

1:14:22.031 --> 1:14:24.234
- Move! Out of my way!
- Other way!

1:14:31.139 --> 1:14:34.309
Get these animals out!
We gotta get this thing open!

1:14:37.879 --> 1:14:40.150
Oh! Think, Daisy. Think!

1:14:43.085 --> 1:14:45.054
That's it!

1:14:51.861 --> 1:14:53.062
Move!

1:14:53.094 --> 1:14:55.063
Those who do not
live by the rules

1:14:55.097 --> 1:14:58.001
shall fall by the rules!

1:15:00.102 --> 1:15:05.008
Please follow all
emergency exit rules. Thank you!

1:15:05.040 --> 1:15:07.142
Jerry, mate,
I'm here, I've got ya!

1:15:10.379 --> 1:15:14.017
- Huh! Kerry, are you okay?
- Go, you'll be safe!

1:15:14.049 --> 1:15:17.152
Daisy, are you... Daisy!

1:15:17.186 --> 1:15:18.321
Where's Daisy?

1:16:16.312 --> 1:16:18.915
Get out of here! It won't hold!

1:16:39.134 --> 1:16:40.469
Ronda!

1:16:43.539 --> 1:16:45.442
Ronda!

1:16:58.153 --> 1:17:00.924
Daisy?

1:17:00.956 --> 1:17:02.491
Daisy!

1:17:11.500 --> 1:17:12.535
Huh?

1:17:33.321 --> 1:17:37.292
Ronda, listen, um,
I need to tell you something.

1:17:37.326 --> 1:17:39.029
I know...

1:17:40.329 --> 1:17:41.497
dad.

1:17:46.302 --> 1:17:49.272
No, no, I was...

1:17:49.304 --> 1:17:51.307
I was the one that was supposed
to look after ya,

1:17:51.339 --> 1:17:54.443
make sure nothing bad
ever happened to ya.

1:17:54.477 --> 1:17:57.046
And then I left.

1:17:57.079 --> 1:18:00.383
And I left ya, like a coward!

1:18:00.415 --> 1:18:03.485
Can ya, can ya forgive me?

1:18:09.058 --> 1:18:13.063
Ronda, find Daisy!
I'll make us a way out of here.

1:18:15.531 --> 1:18:18.034
Daisy, where are you?

1:18:18.067 --> 1:18:21.404
- Daisy!
- Ronda?

1:18:25.374 --> 1:18:28.344
Daisy! Daisy!

1:18:28.376 --> 1:18:31.313
Daisy! Daisy!

1:18:31.347 --> 1:18:33.515
Vitals signs are good,
vitals are steady.

1:18:33.549 --> 1:18:37.287
Nurse, check her blood pressure.
Oh! She's waking up!

1:18:40.455 --> 1:18:44.092
Um, it's exactly
what I was afraid of!

1:18:44.125 --> 1:18:45.427
Oh, no! What?

1:18:45.460 --> 1:18:47.062
- Skeletons!
- Ah!

1:18:47.095 --> 1:18:48.430
Ah...

1:18:50.265 --> 1:18:53.635
- Oh! Daisy!
- Hey there, kiddo!

1:18:53.669 --> 1:18:55.505
You gave us
quite a scare there, sport.

1:18:55.537 --> 1:18:57.807
And we're all here for you, hon.

1:18:57.839 --> 1:18:59.374
All of us.

1:19:08.217 --> 1:19:09.818
Everyone?

1:19:09.852 --> 1:19:13.488
Ronda, thank you.

1:19:13.522 --> 1:19:16.092
How can I ever repay you?

1:19:16.125 --> 1:19:20.229
Silly quokka!
You already have.

1:19:23.198 --> 1:19:26.602
The stadium!
Did everyone make it out okay?

1:19:26.634 --> 1:19:30.539
- Ah, take it easy, sweetie.
- Everybody is fine.

1:19:30.572 --> 1:19:33.342
- Thanks to you.
- Me?

1:19:33.375 --> 1:19:35.578
But what happened to Drago?

1:19:35.611 --> 1:19:38.514
Why don't you have
a slice of honey toast, sweetie?

1:19:38.546 --> 1:19:40.349
Honey toast?

1:19:42.518 --> 1:19:45.555
"Drago banned and arrested."

1:19:48.124 --> 1:19:50.226
Honey, what's wrong?

1:19:51.326 --> 1:19:54.063
Oh, nothing, it's just...

1:19:55.630 --> 1:19:58.601
I never got to achieve my dream.

1:19:58.634 --> 1:20:01.170
Oh, honey, it's alright.

1:20:01.202 --> 1:20:03.171
But, it isn't alright, mum.

1:20:03.205 --> 1:20:06.209
I completely ignored everything
you asked of me.

1:20:06.241 --> 1:20:08.376
I wasn't the face
of Quokka Rocks.

1:20:08.410 --> 1:20:10.446
All for some dream
that the world would see me

1:20:10.478 --> 1:20:13.515
as more than just
a silly little quokka.

1:20:13.549 --> 1:20:15.585
Oh, you galah,
we don't think that.

1:20:15.617 --> 1:20:18.387
No silly, at all.

1:20:21.924 --> 1:20:25.328
There's something
that we think you should see.

1:20:25.361 --> 1:20:26.662
Dad, what are you...

1:20:26.695 --> 1:20:30.398
Feast your eyes, Daisy!

1:20:30.432 --> 1:20:34.504
Can you change my bedpan?

1:20:34.536 --> 1:20:37.439
- It's the other side, honey.
- Ooh, sorry!

1:20:37.473 --> 1:20:39.609
Come with us, Daisy.

1:20:39.642 --> 1:20:43.479
- Are you sure you can't see?
- No peeking, hon!

1:20:43.512 --> 1:20:46.381
Dad, I'm already
covering my eyes.

1:20:46.415 --> 1:20:49.185
Alright, alright,
just making sure.

1:20:49.218 --> 1:20:50.920
We know you had your heart set
on becoming

1:20:50.952 --> 1:20:52.687
the World's Scariest Animal,

1:20:52.720 --> 1:20:57.226
but we think this title
is a little more fitting.

1:21:03.965 --> 1:21:06.635
Daisy! Daisy!

1:21:08.804 --> 1:21:10.406
- Daisy.
- Daisy.

1:21:10.438 --> 1:21:13.508
We couldn't be prouder
of you, sweetie.

1:21:21.784 --> 1:21:25.388
<i>My name is Daisy Quokka.</i>

1:21:25.420 --> 1:21:27.389
<i>And there's nothing ordinary
about life here</i>

1:21:27.423 --> 1:21:30.526
<i>on Quokka Rocks.</i>

1:21:30.558 --> 1:21:33.795
<i>We are a species
that now lives our dreams</i>

1:21:33.829 --> 1:21:36.566
<i>whatever they may be.</i>

1:21:36.598 --> 1:21:39.802
<i>More importantly,
our actions inspire others</i>

1:21:39.835 --> 1:21:41.470
<i>to live their dreams, too.</i>

1:21:41.503 --> 1:21:42.671
Please welcome

1:21:42.705 --> 1:21:47.610
the World's Bravest Animal!

1:21:47.643 --> 1:21:49.545
<i>For Ronda and Frankie?</i>

1:21:49.577 --> 1:21:52.447
<i>That means making up
for lost time as a family.</i>

1:21:52.481 --> 1:21:53.648
...ever!

1:21:53.682 --> 1:21:55.218
<i>For Jerry?</i>

1:21:55.250 --> 1:21:56.384
<i>He actually learned how to be</i>

1:21:56.418 --> 1:21:58.987
<i>a pretty dang good coach.</i>

1:21:59.021 --> 1:22:00.723
<i>And as for me?</i>

1:22:00.755 --> 1:22:04.293
<i>Well, I've learned
that when life puts obstacles</i>

1:22:04.326 --> 1:22:07.330
<i>in your path, you don't quit.</i>

1:22:07.362 --> 1:22:10.398
<i>Instead,
you follow a few wise words</i>

1:22:10.432 --> 1:22:13.669
<i>once spoken by a true champion.</i>
