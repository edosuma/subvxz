WEBVTT

00:02.364 --> 00:04.252
who do you think
should speak first?

00:04.372 --> 00:06.060
I think it should be me
and then you.

00:06.180 --> 00:08.233
But, if you want,
it could be you and then me.

00:08.353 --> 00:10.059
Or it could go me, you, me.

00:10.110 --> 00:12.028
- What do you think?
- How about just you?

00:12.096 --> 00:13.196
Thank you, Ron. Yes.

00:13.247 --> 00:14.831
Tomorrow,
the Parks and Rec Department

00:14.899 --> 00:18.368
is receiving a commendation
at the Indiana Statehouse

00:18.435 --> 00:20.470
for bringing
the harvest festival back.

00:20.538 --> 00:22.772
And although
it's purely ceremonial,

00:22.840 --> 00:25.074
it's a huge deal for me
to go to the Statehouse.

00:25.125 --> 00:28.077
I couldn't care less
about the commendation.

00:28.145 --> 00:32.882
But Indianapolis is home to
Charles Mulligan's steakhouse,

00:32.933 --> 00:35.618
the best damn steakhouse
in the damn state.

00:35.686 --> 00:39.122
I have taken a picture of every
steak I've ever eaten there.

00:39.190 --> 00:40.590
June 2004.

00:40.658 --> 00:43.726
Porterhouse, medium rare,
bearnaise sauce.

00:43.794 --> 00:45.195
January 2000.

00:45.262 --> 00:47.030
They call this one
"the enforcer."

00:47.097 --> 00:48.698
February '96.

00:48.766 --> 00:52.535
The steak: Rib-eye.
The whiskey: Lagavulin 16.

00:52.603 --> 00:55.305
The lady next to me:
A bitch.

00:55.372 --> 00:57.407
Specifically,
my ex-wife Tammy.

00:57.474 --> 00:59.459
Okay, this is...
this is the first time

00:59.543 --> 01:00.944
I ever went there.

01:01.011 --> 01:04.980
Oh, look at me.
I'm just a kid.

01:08.052 --> 01:17.975
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:25.152 --> 01:26.802
She's showing
some elephant pic...

01:26.854 --> 01:29.906
Oh, la la!
Look who's fancy!

01:29.973 --> 01:33.142
Oh, am I wearing an ascot?
I didn't notice.

01:33.193 --> 01:35.411
Big night
at the Snakehole Lounge.

01:35.479 --> 01:36.913
It's a launch party

01:36.980 --> 01:40.500
for Dennis Feinstein's new fragrance:
Allergic-For men.

01:40.584 --> 01:43.169
Pawnee's own Dennis Feinstein
is a real up-and-comer

01:43.254 --> 01:45.505
in the world of microbrewed
perfumes and body sprays.

01:45.589 --> 01:47.874
His ether-based perfume
"Blackout"

01:47.958 --> 01:50.059
was named one
<i>Maxim's</i> top 100 ways

01:50.127 --> 01:51.894
to trick someone into sex.

01:51.962 --> 01:54.397
The club opens at 6:00,
event starts at 9:00.

01:54.465 --> 01:55.515
Oh, no, no, way too late.

01:55.599 --> 01:57.216
I will be deep
into my bath by then.

01:57.301 --> 02:00.836
Don't let us picture that.
Ben, you gonna go?

02:00.888 --> 02:02.889
Oh, uh, I don't think so.

02:02.973 --> 02:04.240
Probably just gonna take it easy,

02:04.308 --> 02:05.725
but thank you.

02:05.809 --> 02:07.110
You know, they always ask me
to go out with them.

02:07.177 --> 02:08.394
They're just being polite.

02:08.479 --> 02:09.612
I move around a lot,

02:09.680 --> 02:11.030
so the friends I make
in these cities,

02:11.115 --> 02:13.950
they're like
Facebook friends, you know?

02:14.018 --> 02:18.854
"Hey, Doug from Bloomington is
thinking about buying a shirt."

02:18.906 --> 02:21.190
I mean, come on, Doug, who cares?

02:21.241 --> 02:23.092
Okay, Tom, I want you to take Ben

02:23.160 --> 02:25.078
and make him go
to that antihistamine party.

02:25.162 --> 02:26.862
It's "Allergic," and forget it.

02:26.914 --> 02:28.231
He doesn't know anybody in town.

02:28.299 --> 02:31.067
Come on, Tom, take him under
your tiny little wing.

02:31.135 --> 02:32.802
He's a fully grown man, Leslie.

02:32.870 --> 02:34.387
And tonight's just not
about pleasure.

02:34.471 --> 02:36.389
I'm schmoozing Dennis Feinstein

02:36.473 --> 02:39.041
so I can pitch him
my new cologne, "Tommy Fresh."

02:39.093 --> 02:40.543
Okay, well,
while you're doing that,

02:40.611 --> 02:42.545
I want you to picture Ben
in his motel room,

02:42.613 --> 02:44.714
all by himself with no friends,
staring at the wall.

02:44.765 --> 02:45.815
- Deal.
- Tom.

02:47.017 --> 02:48.651
So my band's working
on a new album.

02:48.719 --> 02:50.103
Oh, yeah?
What's it called?

02:50.187 --> 02:54.457
<i>April Ludgate Is</i>
<i>the Best Ever, Volume One.</i>

02:54.525 --> 02:56.426
Shut up.

02:56.493 --> 02:57.727
So, uh, what do you
want to do tonight?

02:57.778 --> 02:59.462
We could watch TV
at Burly's house

02:59.530 --> 03:01.698
or we could watch TV
at your house.

03:01.765 --> 03:03.583
Or, I mean, we could
watch TV at best buy.

03:03.667 --> 03:05.335
Why don't we go to Tom's thing?

03:05.402 --> 03:08.237
That weird cologne party thing
at the Snakehole?

03:08.305 --> 03:09.305
Oh.

03:09.373 --> 03:11.341
I kind of forgot
that you need money

03:11.408 --> 03:12.908
when you have a girlfriend.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.310
Eh!

03:14.378 --> 03:16.179
I want to treat April
like a queen,

03:16.246 --> 03:22.285
and queens deserve flowers
and massages,

03:22.353 --> 03:24.804
chocolate, booze,

03:24.888 --> 03:26.656
diamonds, rubies, emeralds,

03:26.724 --> 03:29.359
them treasure chests
full of scarves,

03:29.426 --> 03:31.260
different kinds of lubes
that warm up

03:31.311 --> 03:32.695
when you rub 'em on stuff.

03:32.763 --> 03:35.448
I'm gonna give her
all that stuff and more.

03:35.532 --> 03:38.434
Hmm, that sounds pretty awesome.
Yeah, let's do it.

03:38.502 --> 03:39.435
- Okay.
- Okay.

03:39.486 --> 03:41.437
- All right. Bye.
- Bye.

03:41.488 --> 03:44.807
I don't know.
I guess we're dating.

03:44.875 --> 03:50.446
It's new. Whatever.
I don't like labels.

03:50.497 --> 03:52.548
Go away.

03:52.616 --> 03:55.168
- This?
- That would be good.

03:55.252 --> 03:56.836
But does it say,
"Hello, general assembly,

03:56.920 --> 03:59.522
I've come to Indianapolis
to accept your commendation"?

03:59.590 --> 04:01.057
As much as any one dress could.

04:01.124 --> 04:02.225
Hmm.

04:02.292 --> 04:03.643
Leslie, I think Chris
is cheating on me.

04:03.727 --> 04:06.062
What?
That lying bastard.

04:06.129 --> 04:07.129
Wait.
How do you know?

04:07.181 --> 04:09.732
I don't have any actual proof.

04:09.800 --> 04:11.184
Oh, then I'm sure
he's not cheating on you.

04:11.268 --> 04:13.986
And if he is, he's a monster.

04:14.071 --> 04:16.072
And if he's not,
you guys are great together.

04:16.140 --> 04:17.473
But if he is, I will kill him.

04:17.524 --> 04:19.341
Well, we had
a really good conversation

04:19.410 --> 04:20.942
about our relationship last week,

04:21.011 --> 04:22.812
and he was very reassuring

04:22.880 --> 04:24.163
that we're headed
in a good direction.

04:24.248 --> 04:25.248
Great.

04:25.315 --> 04:27.183
- But then he got distant.
- Oh.

04:27.251 --> 04:29.118
And when I asked to come
visit him in Indianapolis,

04:29.186 --> 04:31.187
he was totally weird.

04:31.255 --> 04:33.689
He was weird.

04:33.757 --> 04:34.924
Look, it sounds like
you're just spiraling.

04:34.992 --> 04:36.225
But what if I'm not?
What if I'm not?

04:36.293 --> 04:38.294
What if he has a girl up there?

04:38.345 --> 04:40.162
I think he's cheating on me.

04:40.214 --> 04:41.431
Wow. Okay.

04:41.498 --> 04:43.566
Well, luckily,
I'm heading up there.

04:43.634 --> 04:45.134
I'll... I'll invite him
out to dinner

04:45.202 --> 04:46.269
and I'll poke around
a little bit.

04:46.336 --> 04:48.170
Okay.

04:48.222 --> 04:49.722
I mean, he's not gonna be able
to keep anything from me.

04:49.807 --> 04:52.442
In high school, they used to
call me Angela Lansbury.

04:52.509 --> 04:55.278
But that was because
of my haircut.

04:55.345 --> 04:56.562
Hey, champ.

04:56.647 --> 04:58.915
Hey, champ...ion.

04:58.982 --> 05:00.917
Listen, you should
come out tonight.

05:00.984 --> 05:02.418
The club's gonna be dope.

05:02.486 --> 05:04.036
Plus, I'm pretty sure you
have nothing else going on.

05:04.121 --> 05:05.588
Well, that's not totally true.

05:05.656 --> 05:07.523
The owner of the motel
I'm staying at

05:07.591 --> 05:10.042
said she was gonna screen
<i>Hope Floats</i> in the lobby.

05:10.127 --> 05:11.561
Asked me if I wanted to watch.

05:11.628 --> 05:13.930
Yeah. You should
probably get out of that.

05:13.997 --> 05:15.131
I think she's gonna murder you.

05:15.199 --> 05:16.499
Come on down to the Snakehole.

05:16.550 --> 05:18.468
I'm not gonna take no
for an answer.

05:18.535 --> 05:21.087
Okay. Yeah, no,
I'll... I'll stop by.

05:21.171 --> 05:22.088
- Thank you.
- Cool.

05:22.172 --> 05:23.239
Hey, you mind if I ask?

05:23.307 --> 05:24.223
What are you gonna wear tonight?

05:24.308 --> 05:25.475
Uh, you know,

05:25.542 --> 05:27.944
I was probably just
gonna stick with this.

05:28.011 --> 05:29.846
Come on, seriously.

05:29.913 --> 05:30.980
What are you...
What are you gonna wear?

05:31.048 --> 05:32.047
Oh, something totally different.

05:32.099 --> 05:33.316
Probably go home
and grab something.

05:33.383 --> 05:35.050
Cool.

05:36.520 --> 05:38.905
If you would be willing
to just take a brief pit stop,

05:38.989 --> 05:43.192
we could see Indiana's
second largest rocking chair.

05:43.260 --> 05:44.777
No.

05:44.862 --> 05:47.563
Then maybe we should take
a quick two-hour sojourn

05:47.614 --> 05:51.033
to Dame Gervin's Misshapen
Celebrity Castle.

05:51.084 --> 05:54.270
It's where Madame Tussaud sends
all of its failed wax figures,

05:54.338 --> 05:55.922
and if you can figure out
who it is,

05:56.006 --> 05:58.174
- you get to take it home.
- No.

05:58.242 --> 05:59.709
What's wrong with you,
grouchy pants?

05:59.760 --> 06:03.045
I've been fasting all day
to save room for Mulligan's.

06:03.096 --> 06:04.797
Fasting's not healthy
for you, Ron.

06:04.882 --> 06:06.215
Leslie, you need to understand,

06:06.283 --> 06:09.051
we are heading for the most
special place on earth.

06:09.102 --> 06:10.820
When I'm done eating
a Mulligan's meal,

06:10.888 --> 06:13.356
for weeks afterwards,
there are flecks of meat

06:13.423 --> 06:16.025
in my mustache,
and I refuse to clean it

06:16.093 --> 06:17.226
because every now and then,

06:17.294 --> 06:19.478
a piece of meat
will fall into my mouth.

06:19.563 --> 06:20.813
Oh, I forgot to tell you,

06:20.898 --> 06:22.532
Chris Traeger is joining us
for dinner tonight.

06:22.599 --> 06:24.116
Please tell me he's
meeting us at the restaurant.

06:24.201 --> 06:25.117
No.
We are picking him up.

06:25.202 --> 06:26.669
Damn it, woman!

06:28.238 --> 06:30.640
Welcome. I am so glad
you guys called.

06:30.707 --> 06:31.991
This is gonna be great.
Come on in, come on in.

06:32.075 --> 06:33.409
- Sure.
- Or we could just...

06:33.477 --> 06:36.796
Wow!
Look at your foyer.

06:36.880 --> 06:39.148
- It's like a spa in here.
- Exactly.

06:39.216 --> 06:40.716
The entranceway to your house

06:40.784 --> 06:42.385
sends a message to the world
about who you are.

06:42.452 --> 06:45.621
And the front door provides
energy flow and opportunity.

06:45.689 --> 06:46.973
You cannot limit that.

06:47.057 --> 06:48.841
Yeah. Ron doesn't even
have a front door.

06:48.926 --> 06:50.192
He won't even tell me
his address.

06:50.260 --> 06:52.562
- Ask him where he lives.
- Where do you live?

06:52.629 --> 06:54.030
Why?

06:54.097 --> 06:57.934
So this is some kind of
coat closet or something?

06:57.985 --> 07:01.303
Ah! Wow. There's a lot
of men's coats in here.

07:01.355 --> 07:02.705
I like coats.

07:02.773 --> 07:05.024
Could I use your bathroom
really quick?

07:05.108 --> 07:06.659
- It's right behind you.
- Great.

07:06.743 --> 07:09.495
Oh, the toilet seat's up.

07:12.115 --> 07:16.168
Hey, let me get a beer
and a Pawnee sunrise.

07:16.253 --> 07:17.954
Do you want to pay cash
or start a tab?

07:18.021 --> 07:20.590
I... it's o... Uh, I-I know Tom.

07:20.657 --> 07:23.259
- Tom who?
- Tom Hammen... Hammenstein.

07:23.326 --> 07:24.460
- Haverford.
- Haverford.

07:24.511 --> 07:26.012
He's, like, my best friend.

07:26.096 --> 07:28.764
Hey, Freddy, this guy
says he knows Tom

07:28.832 --> 07:30.049
and wants a drink for free.

07:30.133 --> 07:32.001
You, uh, you have money
to pay for those drinks?

07:32.069 --> 07:34.470
Yes.

07:34.538 --> 07:35.905
No.

07:35.973 --> 07:38.040
Make room for
the paying customers, huh?

07:41.612 --> 07:42.545
Let's go, Knope!

07:42.613 --> 07:44.046
Just one second.

07:44.114 --> 07:45.147
Hey, what's up?

07:45.215 --> 07:47.049
Hey, I think you might be right.

07:47.117 --> 07:50.519
I found a women's razor
in Chris' shower

07:50.570 --> 07:52.088
and a pink swimming cap.

07:52.155 --> 07:53.589
Are you serious?
What the hell?

07:53.657 --> 07:55.374
You know, it could be nothing,

07:55.459 --> 07:57.126
but it feels like something.
I don't...

07:57.194 --> 07:58.577
I'm coming up there.

07:58.662 --> 07:59.862
Wait.

08:00.964 --> 08:02.198
All right, okay.

08:02.265 --> 08:04.667
All right, let's go.

08:06.299 --> 08:08.074
Oh my God.

08:08.194 --> 08:10.262
They... they just forgot to
unlock the door, that's all.

08:11.813 --> 08:13.831
Ron, it looks like they're closed

08:13.915 --> 08:15.783
for some kind of
health code violation.

08:17.419 --> 08:19.653
- Aah!
- Ron, stop it! Ron?

08:21.957 --> 08:28.212
They just boarded her up like
she was some common warehouse.

08:28.296 --> 08:30.564
I should have been here.

08:30.632 --> 08:31.799
What happened to the steaks

08:31.867 --> 08:34.934
that were in there
when they closed?

08:35.003 --> 08:36.871
Do you think they got eaten?

08:36.938 --> 08:39.155
Why don't we go back to my place

08:39.224 --> 08:41.275
and I'll fire up the grill?

08:41.342 --> 08:43.844
You sure you're not expecting
company or something?

08:43.912 --> 08:45.546
No.

08:45.614 --> 08:46.730
What do you say, Ron?

08:46.815 --> 08:48.215
Go back to my place
and make you some grub?

08:48.283 --> 08:52.119
It'll be just as good as it
would have been here.

08:52.187 --> 08:53.571
- Okay.
- Okay.

08:53.655 --> 08:57.525
That man is a legend.

08:57.592 --> 08:59.093
Think about all the scents
he's created.

08:59.160 --> 09:04.215
Attack, yearning, thickening,
itch, coma, sideboob.

09:04.299 --> 09:06.400
Dennis Feinstein, though?
I don't know.

09:06.468 --> 09:07.635
He should probably
change his name

09:07.702 --> 09:08.969
to something a little more exotic

09:09.037 --> 09:11.555
if he wants to make it
big in perfume.

09:11.640 --> 09:13.541
Oh, his real name is Dante Fiero,

09:13.608 --> 09:15.175
but he changed it
to Dennis Feinstein

09:15.243 --> 09:16.810
'cause that's way
more exotic in Pawnee.

09:16.878 --> 09:18.879
Okay.
So what's your plan?

09:18.947 --> 09:22.733
Wait till he's alone,
then I walk up and spray him

09:22.817 --> 09:26.020
with Tommy Fresh,
and I say, "Uh-oh.

09:26.087 --> 09:27.855
Looks like you just
nailed your future."

09:27.923 --> 09:33.360
Yeah. That might
actually work.

09:33.428 --> 09:34.962
Is everything okay?

09:35.030 --> 09:39.300
Um, it kind of sucks
that I'm super broke

09:39.367 --> 09:40.868
and I want to buy you stuff

09:40.919 --> 09:43.370
and it's embarrassing
that I can't, but...

09:43.438 --> 09:45.873
I'm broke too,
and I don't want anything.

09:45.941 --> 09:47.575
I just want to hang out with you.

09:47.642 --> 09:49.793
Plus, I can get free drinks
anytime I want.

09:49.878 --> 09:51.045
How?

09:51.112 --> 09:54.348
Uh, I'm a girl in a sleazy club.

09:55.951 --> 09:56.951
Hey.

09:57.018 --> 09:58.118
Hey.

09:58.186 --> 09:59.653
I hate drinking alone.

09:59.721 --> 10:00.721
Can I get you a drink?

10:00.789 --> 10:02.623
Sure.
Triple whiskey.

10:02.691 --> 10:03.991
What's your name?

10:04.059 --> 10:06.060
- Oprah.
- I'm Kevin.

10:06.127 --> 10:08.829
Cool. I kind of
want to drink alone.

10:08.897 --> 10:10.114
- But...
- I said I want to drink alone.

10:10.198 --> 10:12.032
Thanks. Bye.

10:12.100 --> 10:13.701
Here. You take this one.

10:13.768 --> 10:19.640
I will, um, get myself
a Martini from that idiot.

10:19.708 --> 10:23.377
So, Chris, do you
have any sisters?

10:23.445 --> 10:25.212
No, I don't, Leslie.
Do you have sisters?

10:25.280 --> 10:27.848
Maybe. So how's your mom?
Is she visiting?

10:27.916 --> 10:29.183
No, she's home up in Wisconsin.

10:29.250 --> 10:30.684
- Is your mom visiting?
- Any aunts?

10:30.752 --> 10:32.419
- Nope. You have aunts?
- Girl cousins?

10:32.470 --> 10:34.805
- A youthful grandmother, perhaps?
- Nope.

10:34.889 --> 10:37.474
Did you forget
how to have a conversation?

10:37.559 --> 10:38.759
I am so happy you guys are here.

10:38.810 --> 10:41.562
I'm gonna go fire up the grill.

10:41.630 --> 10:43.964
- I'm gonna kill him, Ron.
- Why?

10:44.032 --> 10:47.201
Chris is cheating on Ann.
There's evidence everywhere.

10:47.268 --> 10:49.403
She's coming up here
so they can have it out.

10:49.470 --> 10:52.373
Ask her to bring
some garlic salt.

10:52.440 --> 10:55.776
I'm worried
Chris doesn't have any.

10:57.412 --> 10:59.363
I got this from a waiter.

10:59.447 --> 11:01.281
I told him I had
a pork deficiency.

11:01.333 --> 11:02.700
Sweet!
Pigs in a blanket.

11:02.784 --> 11:04.702
I always wondered
why they call them that.

11:04.786 --> 11:05.753
Look what I got.

11:05.820 --> 11:06.954
Look what I got
from the bathroom.

11:07.022 --> 11:09.923
Mints. Six of them.

11:09.991 --> 11:11.508
- Nice.
- Yeah.

11:11.593 --> 11:15.179
Okay, whoever gets
the most free stuff

11:15.263 --> 11:16.430
by the end of the night wins.

11:16.497 --> 11:18.832
Deal.

11:18.883 --> 11:20.768
Go!

11:20.835 --> 11:21.969
Ron, would you like some salad?

11:22.020 --> 11:25.639
Since I am not a rabbit,
no, I do not.

11:25.707 --> 11:27.057
Try it.
Salad's good for you.

11:27.142 --> 11:29.676
You got it.

11:29.728 --> 11:31.812
Mmm, delicious.

11:31.863 --> 11:33.647
So, Chris, what do you do up here

11:33.698 --> 11:34.848
in your spare time?

11:34.899 --> 11:38.351
Well, uh, I exercise,
and I exercise my mind.

11:38.403 --> 11:40.821
And I try to keep up
on current events.

11:40.889 --> 11:43.290
- Oh, that's what you call it.
- Sorry?

11:43.358 --> 11:44.291
How are things going with Ann?

11:44.359 --> 11:45.793
You know what's funny about Ann?

11:45.860 --> 11:46.994
She's my best friend,

11:47.062 --> 11:48.128
and anyone who'd hurt her

11:48.196 --> 11:50.030
is someone I would murder
probably.

11:50.098 --> 11:52.733
Oh, is that what's upsetting you?

11:52.801 --> 11:53.867
Hmm?

11:53.935 --> 11:55.235
This is very
uncomfortable for me.

11:55.303 --> 11:57.971
I don't know what to say.

11:58.039 --> 12:00.340
Watch the master work it.

12:00.392 --> 12:01.675
I'm the Yoda of networking.

12:01.726 --> 12:04.061
Well, Yoda wouldn't
actually need networking.

12:04.145 --> 12:05.245
I mean, his powers
were more spiritual.

12:05.313 --> 12:08.048
- Shut up, you nerd!
- I get it. Okay.

12:10.652 --> 12:13.620
Mr. Feinstein,
Tom Haverford.

12:13.688 --> 12:15.939
I'm the organizer of this soiree

12:16.024 --> 12:17.725
and I'm also a huge fan of yours.

12:17.792 --> 12:19.827
I use all your cologne,
sometimes two at once.

12:19.894 --> 12:22.362
I don't recommend that.
Are you from the FDA?

12:22.414 --> 12:24.631
You know, legally,
if you're from the FDA,

12:24.699 --> 12:25.666
you have to tell me.

12:25.734 --> 12:27.418
I wanted to talk to you

12:27.502 --> 12:29.870
because I actually created
my own scent.

12:29.938 --> 12:33.307
Oh, great. I'd love
to smell it, right?

12:34.642 --> 12:36.510
- I know you're a busy guy.
- Yeah, man.

12:36.578 --> 12:37.945
I'm crazy busy.

12:38.012 --> 12:40.798
But all day long, people
are pitching me colognes.

12:40.882 --> 12:42.950
That guy just pitched me
a cologne called "Sluts."

12:43.017 --> 12:44.318
I'm gonna tell you
what I told him.

12:44.385 --> 12:45.819
Not just anybody can do this.

12:45.887 --> 12:48.021
Although it's a great name
and I'm probably gonna steal it.

12:48.089 --> 12:49.757
Please, it'll take two seconds.

12:49.824 --> 12:51.925
If you like it, maybe we
go into business together,

12:51.993 --> 12:53.360
branch out in other states,

12:53.428 --> 12:55.329
move over to watches
and fancy raincoats,

12:55.396 --> 12:56.763
open up stores
in London and Paris.

12:56.815 --> 12:58.532
I don't know.
I haven't thought it through.

12:58.600 --> 12:59.700
But for now,

12:59.768 --> 13:03.937
I want to present Tommy Fresh.

13:07.675 --> 13:09.543
All right, I get it.

13:09.610 --> 13:12.079
It's a gag scent.
Hilarious.

13:12.147 --> 13:15.516
As in, "It's hilarious
how awesome it is"?

13:15.583 --> 13:16.583
It smells like somebody

13:16.651 --> 13:18.685
spilled Chinese food
in a bird cage.

13:18.753 --> 13:20.888
Horrible.
It's assaultive.

13:20.955 --> 13:23.924
It takes everything in my power
to not retch right now.

13:23.992 --> 13:26.460
Kid, you need to
find another game.

13:26.528 --> 13:29.596
Leave perfumery to the real men.

13:32.534 --> 13:33.901
Hey, Ann, if you get this,

13:33.968 --> 13:35.235
I don't know if you
should come up here.

13:35.303 --> 13:36.636
He's not worth it, okay?

13:36.688 --> 13:38.438
Just call me,
let me know where you are,

13:38.490 --> 13:40.574
- and if you have...
- Aah!

13:40.641 --> 13:41.708
Ron?

13:41.776 --> 13:43.810
What in the devil's name is this?

13:43.862 --> 13:45.078
Portobello mushrooms.

13:45.146 --> 13:47.414
- Where's the steak?
- Oh, there's no steak.

13:47.482 --> 13:49.583
That's a healthier option.
It's organically grown.

13:49.651 --> 13:51.952
Lord.

13:52.003 --> 13:53.670
Ron, are you okay?

13:53.755 --> 13:54.922
Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay.

13:54.989 --> 13:58.158
Could you get us
a cold compress or something?

14:01.212 --> 14:04.181
♪ ♪

14:04.265 --> 14:07.868
Hey, uh, six beers
for, uh, table 12.

14:07.936 --> 14:09.887
- Do you work here?
- Yeah.

14:09.971 --> 14:12.306
My dad owns this place.
I'm Janet.

14:12.357 --> 14:13.874
Janet Snakehole.

14:13.942 --> 14:17.027
Hey! This round's
on the house!

14:17.111 --> 14:18.695
- All right!
- Whoo!

14:18.780 --> 14:19.980
How about some tips?

14:20.031 --> 14:22.783
- Uh, gum or mint, sir?
- Uh, gum.

14:22.851 --> 14:24.651
- All out, sir.
- Then mints, I guess.

14:24.719 --> 14:26.119
Don't have those either, sir.

14:26.187 --> 14:30.073
- Do you have anything?
- Out of everything, sir.

14:30.158 --> 14:31.792
This is so awesome!

14:31.860 --> 14:34.394
We are like Robin Hood.

14:34.462 --> 14:38.715
We steal from the club
and we give to ourselves.

14:38.800 --> 14:40.417
Look, we'll find
a 24-hour diner.

14:40.501 --> 14:42.252
Or we can get one of those cows

14:42.337 --> 14:43.871
that we saw on the way up here

14:43.938 --> 14:45.505
and we'll bring it back and
we'll make steaks out of that.

14:46.674 --> 14:48.675
Ann Perkins,
what are you doing here?

14:48.726 --> 14:50.427
Whose pink razor
is in your shower?

14:50.511 --> 14:51.762
Excuse me?

14:51.846 --> 14:53.013
Leslie found a pink razor

14:53.064 --> 14:55.048
and a pink swimming cap
in your shower.

14:55.116 --> 14:56.483
Whose is it?

14:56.550 --> 14:57.818
I guess you're talking
about my razor.

14:57.886 --> 14:59.386
I shave my legs for swimming,

14:59.454 --> 15:00.720
and women's razors work better.

15:00.772 --> 15:03.056
For whatever reason,
men's razor technology

15:03.124 --> 15:05.292
hasn't figured out how to
properly contour the shinbone.

15:05.360 --> 15:07.744
And... and the swimming cap?

15:07.829 --> 15:10.430
Indiana breast cancer
awareness triathlon 2009.

15:10.498 --> 15:12.416
Came in fourth.

15:12.500 --> 15:15.068
Well, I found concealer
in your medicine cabinet.

15:15.136 --> 15:16.169
What's that about?

15:16.237 --> 15:18.288
I'm a human being.

15:18.373 --> 15:20.424
Sometimes I get blemishes.
I'm not perfect.

15:20.508 --> 15:23.944
Oh, God.
I am so sorry, honey.

15:24.012 --> 15:25.262
I'm so embarrassed.

15:25.346 --> 15:28.081
I was scared that you
were cheating on me.

15:28.149 --> 15:31.318
No, I'm not cheating on you.

15:31.386 --> 15:34.254
But I'm also not dating you.

15:34.322 --> 15:36.957
We broke up last week.

15:40.540 --> 15:43.690
We talked at your house.
Do you not remember this?

15:43.810 --> 15:46.261
Of course I remember,
but we didn't break up.

15:46.329 --> 15:48.063
I'm sorry, Ann,
but I'm certain we did.

15:48.131 --> 15:50.466
Okay, you said that you
didn't want to leave Pawnee

15:50.533 --> 15:53.068
and that I was the most amazing
woman you had ever met.

15:53.136 --> 15:54.636
- Which you are.
- And then I said

15:54.704 --> 15:56.405
that I would move to
Indianapolis if I had to,

15:56.456 --> 15:58.107
and you said you didn't
want to make me do that,

15:58.174 --> 15:59.908
and then you said
that in a different world...

15:59.976 --> 16:03.479
Oh, my God.
You broke up with me.

16:03.546 --> 16:05.330
Oh, my God.

16:05.415 --> 16:07.716
Yeah, so here's what happened.

16:07.784 --> 16:10.752
Sweet and beautiful Ann
has never been dumped before,

16:10.820 --> 16:12.671
and Chris is such
a positive person,

16:12.755 --> 16:15.390
when he broke up with her,
she just didn't realize it.

16:15.458 --> 16:16.925
It's kind of understandable,

16:16.993 --> 16:18.694
although it does kind of
make you wonder

16:18.761 --> 16:20.963
how good of a nurse she is.

16:21.030 --> 16:22.297
Oh, my God.

16:22.348 --> 16:23.515
You left, and you said
you were gonna work late,

16:23.600 --> 16:24.833
and I kissed you?

16:24.901 --> 16:27.436
As enjoyable as that was,
I did find it odd.

16:28.738 --> 16:30.706
And then I wanted you
to meet my parents?

16:30.773 --> 16:32.641
I'm sure they're great people,
but strange.

16:32.709 --> 16:33.942
This is humiliating.

16:34.010 --> 16:36.662
I'm sorry, I gotta go.

16:36.746 --> 16:37.663
Hey, w...

16:39.415 --> 16:41.200
Hey, man.

16:41.284 --> 16:45.704
I, uh, got you another melontini.

16:45.788 --> 16:47.189
Thanks.

16:49.092 --> 16:52.461
Listen, that guy is a jerk,

16:52.529 --> 16:54.897
and if you ask me,
he smells like...

16:54.964 --> 16:57.132
Success.

16:57.200 --> 17:00.686
He smells like success.

17:00.770 --> 17:01.970
You know what I smell like?

17:02.021 --> 17:07.509
A teriyaki hairpiece?

17:07.577 --> 17:11.346
I smell like the guy
who's always coming up short.

17:11.414 --> 17:13.682
And you know what?
I'm just sick of it.

17:13.733 --> 17:17.653
Tommy Fresh was my dream.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.555
Now no one's ever
gonna smell it but me.

17:19.622 --> 17:22.191
I can smell your dreams, Tom.

17:22.258 --> 17:24.393
I can.

17:24.460 --> 17:26.728
And I can smell 'em from here.

17:26.796 --> 17:30.198
And honestly, they smell
ing terrible.

17:31.584 --> 17:34.503
But I like Tom.

17:34.571 --> 17:38.056
- I've got a jar of olives.
- Heh! Nice.

17:38.141 --> 17:40.842
A thing of toothpicks
that look like swords.

17:40.910 --> 17:44.012
And a year's supply
of toilet paper.

17:44.080 --> 17:50.018
I got... boom!...
$38 in tips.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.354
$180.

17:55.291 --> 17:57.259
We should give it back.

17:59.762 --> 18:01.563
- Follow me.
- Okay.

18:03.166 --> 18:04.900
Oh, my God.

18:11.257 --> 18:14.042
Wow.
Thank you.

18:15.845 --> 18:17.579
One time,
when I was in high school,

18:17.647 --> 18:21.617
a guy's mom called me
and broke up with me for him.

18:23.019 --> 18:25.621
There was another time
where I was on a date

18:25.688 --> 18:27.456
and I tripped
and broke my kneecap.

18:27.523 --> 18:29.791
And then the guy said
he wasn't "feelin' it,"

18:29.859 --> 18:33.829
so he left and I waited
for an ambulance.

18:33.896 --> 18:35.597
One time I was dating
this guy for a while,

18:35.665 --> 18:36.798
and then he got down on one knee

18:36.866 --> 18:38.467
and he begged me
to never call him again.

18:38.534 --> 18:39.801
One guy broke up with me

18:39.869 --> 18:41.737
while we were in
the shower together.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.805
Skywriting isn't always positive.

18:43.873 --> 18:47.643
Another time, a guy invited me
to a beautiful picnic

18:47.710 --> 18:48.910
with wine and flowers,

18:48.978 --> 18:50.412
and then,
when I tried to sit down,

18:50.480 --> 18:53.415
he said, "Don't eat anything.
Rebecca's coming."

18:53.483 --> 18:54.750
And then he broke up with me.

18:55.952 --> 18:58.820
- Who was Rebecca?
- Yeah. Exactly.

18:58.888 --> 19:01.890
Thanks for driving me.

19:01.958 --> 19:03.091
Wait.

19:03.159 --> 19:04.092
You're getting
your commendation tomorrow

19:04.160 --> 19:05.327
at the Statehouse.

19:05.395 --> 19:07.829
Oh, please.
It's just a goofy ceremony.

19:07.897 --> 19:08.830
I don't even care about it.

19:08.898 --> 19:09.898
Leslie.

19:09.965 --> 19:12.534
Besides, Ron is staying behind.

19:12.602 --> 19:13.802
He'll go.

19:13.870 --> 19:15.904
Is Ron gonna be okay?

19:18.408 --> 19:20.242
I honestly don't know.

19:25.281 --> 19:27.149
This isn't a steak.

19:27.216 --> 19:28.617
Why would you call it that
on your menu?

19:28.685 --> 19:29.985
I don't know what
to tell you, man.

19:33.172 --> 19:36.591
Just give me all the bacon
and eggs you have.

19:36.659 --> 19:37.843
Wait, wait.

19:37.927 --> 19:39.494
I worry what you just heard was,

19:39.545 --> 19:42.180
"Give me a lot
of bacon and eggs."

19:42.265 --> 19:43.799
What I said was,

19:43.850 --> 19:47.719
give me all the bacon
and eggs you have.

19:47.804 --> 19:49.371
Do you understand?

19:53.209 --> 19:54.843
It's called a tommytini.

19:54.894 --> 19:57.579
It's just vodka
and a bunch of cinnamon.

19:57.647 --> 19:59.247
That sounds gross.

19:59.315 --> 20:01.366
- Ben.
- Oh, Miller lite.

20:01.451 --> 20:03.151
- How'd you know?
- Everybody knows.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.152
That's your drink.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.620
- Tommy.
- Let's do this.

20:05.688 --> 20:07.372
♪ You know just what I need ♪

20:07.457 --> 20:09.658
♪ I need that fast money ♪

20:09.726 --> 20:11.827
♪ fast cars, fast women ♪

20:11.894 --> 20:13.161
Mmm!

20:13.212 --> 20:14.546
How's it going?

20:14.630 --> 20:16.998
Hey, look who's socializing!

20:17.050 --> 20:18.433
Yeah, and I'm having a good time.

20:18.501 --> 20:19.751
- Sit with us.
- Okay.

20:19.836 --> 20:22.036
Ann's in kind of a crappy mood

20:22.088 --> 20:23.588
because Chris dumped her.

20:23.673 --> 20:26.241
Ah, yeah, like a week ago, right?

20:26.309 --> 20:30.278
Yeah, but I only knew about it
an hour ago.

20:30.346 --> 20:32.614
Oh, so that's why
you tried to kiss him.

20:32.682 --> 20:35.400
We were all seriously
confused about that.

20:35.485 --> 20:37.919
Who's "we"? What are you...?
Oh, God.

20:38.039 --> 20:41.937

20:42.057 --> 20:43.390
Did you keep the toilet paper?

20:43.442 --> 20:45.576
Yes. I feel bad,
but I need it.

20:45.661 --> 20:46.961
Ew!

20:48.580 --> 20:50.498
Hey, hey, that's gotta be
Feinstein's car.

20:50.565 --> 20:52.366
Give me...
Give me the Tommy Fresh.

20:52.417 --> 20:54.285
- Why?
- Gimme the Tommy Fresh.

21:00.375 --> 21:02.543
He's gonna smell your dreams now.

21:03.912 --> 21:05.947
Are you okay?

21:06.014 --> 21:08.216
- Is it that bad?
- Oh, my God, it's unbelievable.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.794
Oh!
