WEBVTT

00:06.708 --> 00:08.624
What's your boy done
with my diamonds?

00:08.625 --> 00:10.582
My boy wouldn't rip you off,
Saul, he knows what's what.

00:10.583 --> 00:12.207
Let's just tell Saul Gold
who heisted it.

00:12.208 --> 00:13.999
I want that gold, boy.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.457
And if you don't bring it to me,
I will come for it.

00:16.458 --> 00:18.207
We're gonna need
a proper safecracker.

00:18.208 --> 00:20.207
- Norman Gordon!
- I have an expertise

00:20.208 --> 00:22.541
that nobody seems to have
the patience for.

00:22.542 --> 00:24.749
You crack on, Norman,
I'll be back in a minute.

00:24.750 --> 00:28.332
Nobody turns over
Sonny Castillo!

00:28.333 --> 00:30.582
We need to find a way
to move some of this gold

00:30.583 --> 00:32.332
to pay off Saul.
I can fence your gold.

00:32.333 --> 00:34.207
How does she know
about the gold?

00:34.208 --> 00:36.958
Someone had to take action.
Just hear her out about it.

00:40.292 --> 00:42.166
- Yep.
- We're on for tonight.

00:42.167 --> 00:43.250
Nice.

00:47.500 --> 00:50.458
Lads... we're on.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:08.875 --> 01:10.333
Open it!

01:11.333 --> 01:13.208
Open it!

01:22.167 --> 01:23.958
Open it!

01:26.833 --> 01:28.333
And the cage!

01:57.375 --> 01:58.375
Get down!

02:02.458 --> 02:05.958
Bob? You dirty son of a bitch.

02:27.917 --> 02:29.332
Give me a minute with him, okay?

02:29.333 --> 02:31.583
- Two minutes, all right.
- Good man.

02:36.542 --> 02:38.999
You sneaky bastard.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.957
You were supposed to tip us off
about the bullion,

02:40.958 --> 02:43.499
not turn us in!

02:43.500 --> 02:46.166
Where was my cut
on the Fanon heist?

02:46.167 --> 02:47.791
I gave you your bloody cut!

02:47.792 --> 02:51.499
Five percent?
You treated me like a lackey

02:51.500 --> 02:54.541
when I gift-wrapped that one
for you, Vic.

02:54.542 --> 02:58.499
You know, all I wanted
was just to be appreciated.

02:58.500 --> 03:01.082
You know, just to be
one of the boys,

03:01.083 --> 03:02.832
get an invite to a Sunday roast.

03:02.833 --> 03:04.541
Your feelings hurt?

03:04.542 --> 03:06.666
Did we disrespect
your enormous talent

03:06.667 --> 03:08.541
for bribing bank tellers?

03:08.542 --> 03:11.166
Let's not dwell on the past,
Vic, let's focus on the present.

03:11.167 --> 03:15.166
You are looking at a very long
stretch away from your family.

03:15.167 --> 03:18.874
Now, I could help make things
a lot easier for them.

03:18.875 --> 03:22.791
The gold is gone.
Bent coppers with big ideas.

03:22.792 --> 03:25.667
We both got our pants
pulled down.

03:32.500 --> 03:38.207
You put the word on the street,
help me find the gold,

03:38.208 --> 03:41.042
and I'll make sure Lily
and Albert don't want for much.

03:44.042 --> 03:47.749
I'll shoot your bloody
kneecaps off!

03:47.750 --> 03:49.208
I'll take that as a no then.

03:52.500 --> 03:56.500
Enjoy the next 15 to life, mate.
I know I will.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.874
Take him back to the station
and charge him.

04:00.875 --> 04:02.875
Aye-aye, boss.

04:05.500 --> 04:09.332
Vic Hill... big man.

04:09.333 --> 04:12.792
Phone call. I get a phone call.

04:19.916 --> 04:21.250
One.

04:36.500 --> 04:39.499
Hi, darling, it's me.

04:39.500 --> 04:42.332
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'm all right, I'm all right.

04:42.333 --> 04:45.292
You listen very closely,
sweetheart.

04:46.792 --> 04:50.332
Well... it all went
according to plan...

04:50.333 --> 04:51.750
till it didn't.

05:24.375 --> 05:25.957
You know there's not
a fence in town

05:25.958 --> 05:27.499
willing to take on
that kind of heat.

05:27.500 --> 05:30.041
Who said anything
about staying local?

05:30.042 --> 05:31.499
Your passports up to date?

05:31.500 --> 05:33.332
- Passports?
- Where are we going?

05:33.333 --> 05:35.166
- New York.
- New York?

05:35.167 --> 05:37.916
- New York now!
- You guys heard of Nas Stone?

05:37.917 --> 05:38.999
He's that baller jeweler, right?

05:39.000 --> 05:40.791
Correct!

05:40.792 --> 05:42.166
So, what are we
doing here, player?

05:42.167 --> 05:43.874
But not just any baller jeweler.

05:43.875 --> 05:45.207
Time piece?

05:45.208 --> 05:46.624
Nas Stone is
the Brooklyn Bling King.

05:46.625 --> 05:48.166
I got it, son.

05:48.167 --> 05:49.791
New York's jeweler to the stars.

05:49.792 --> 05:52.416
We going full grill!
You gotta make a splash.

05:52.417 --> 05:54.874
See that shit a mile away.
Three diamonds... a ruby...

05:54.875 --> 05:56.582
a Brooklyn B...
and a motherfucking peace sign.

05:56.583 --> 05:58.332
Now, normally, this shit
gonna run you half a mil,

05:58.333 --> 06:00.041
but, you my boy.

06:00.042 --> 06:01.916
We gonna do it for 450
if you blast me on repeat

06:01.917 --> 06:04.332
on Twitter and Insta.

06:04.333 --> 06:06.374
Look, no offense, right,
but I don't know you,

06:06.375 --> 06:08.332
and I trust about
as far as I can throw ya,

06:08.333 --> 06:10.791
and that is not across the Atlantic.
We'd be back in 24 hours,

06:10.792 --> 06:12.791
in time for you to make good
with Saul.

06:12.792 --> 06:14.749
And not wanting to put
too fine a point on it,

06:14.750 --> 06:16.499
he's not gonna give you
an extension.

06:16.500 --> 06:18.957
Sounds like a better idea than,
you know, waiting around here

06:18.958 --> 06:21.250
to get whacked by Sonny, heh.

06:29.625 --> 06:33.707
How much gold is this Nas Stone
fella looking to buy?

06:33.708 --> 06:36.624
He said we'd start off
with 250K sterling.

06:36.625 --> 06:38.541
That should take care
of your immediate problem.

06:38.542 --> 06:41.000
And then, we'll take it from
there if both parties agree.

06:48.125 --> 06:50.666
All right.

06:50.667 --> 06:52.041
But Charlie and I go with ya.

06:52.042 --> 06:53.833
Already booked the tickets.

07:01.333 --> 07:04.250
You're gonna cook
like a burrito.

07:07.542 --> 07:09.874
Did you find Lotti?

07:09.875 --> 07:12.416
Straight-up vanished.

07:12.417 --> 07:14.624
How about you?

07:14.625 --> 07:17.917
Do you know where
my beautiful <i>chica </i> is?

07:22.042 --> 07:24.333
You're not gonna live
long enough to regret that.

07:29.958 --> 07:32.292
No one's coming for you,
old man.

07:53.042 --> 07:54.916
Billy, you've gotta find a way
of getting Norman out,

07:54.917 --> 07:56.707
'cause he ain't
gonna last long with fuckface.

07:56.708 --> 07:59.666
All right, well,
I'll see a man about a dog.

07:59.667 --> 08:02.041
Good lad.

08:02.042 --> 08:06.166
- Lotti Mott.
- Chloe Koen.

08:06.167 --> 08:07.999
I'm an equal partner.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.457
So, get any clever ideas about
blagging my share of the gold,

08:12.458 --> 08:14.042
and I'll feed you to the pigs.

08:15.542 --> 08:17.833
Pig fodder. Got it.

08:21.333 --> 08:24.499
I hate to be a downer,
but one other thing.

08:24.500 --> 08:26.624
How you getting
those past customs?

08:26.625 --> 08:29.750
May I make a suggestion?

08:51.542 --> 08:53.875
Get along then.

09:00.042 --> 09:02.625
Have one for me.

09:04.458 --> 09:07.458
The sleeper, you bastard.

09:10.500 --> 09:12.500
Who are you talking to, Dad?

09:13.667 --> 09:15.957
Nobody, son.

09:15.958 --> 09:18.582
Dad, can we go to the funfair
this weekend with Billy?

09:18.583 --> 09:22.749
No can do, Albert.

09:22.750 --> 09:24.999
I'm a bit tied up at the moment.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.832
But you said we'd go
for my ninth birthday,

09:26.833 --> 09:28.208
and we never did.

09:31.667 --> 09:35.499
Yeah. Sorry about that, mate.

09:35.500 --> 09:37.333
I truly am.

09:39.833 --> 09:41.833
Who are you talking to, Dad?

09:43.667 --> 09:46.250
Bloody sleeper.

09:50.417 --> 09:52.749
But I wanted to go
on the carousel.

09:52.750 --> 09:55.207
Carousel's shite.

09:55.208 --> 09:57.249
- How about crazy golf?
- That's for kids.

09:57.250 --> 10:00.125
- But I am a kid, Dad.
- No, you...

10:03.958 --> 10:06.542
No.

10:10.208 --> 10:13.582
Nervous flyer.

10:13.583 --> 10:15.875
And I haven't been on a plane
since I was a kid.

10:21.958 --> 10:24.124
Beer or wine, sir?

10:24.125 --> 10:26.791
Yeah, let's...
Let's do a G and T.

10:26.792 --> 10:28.124
Certainly, sir.

10:28.125 --> 10:29.999
Meshes better with the valium.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.667
It's the only way to fly.

10:41.167 --> 10:43.749
Why did you bring me
to this shithole?

10:43.750 --> 10:47.207
I told ya, I'm here to see
a man about a dog.

10:47.208 --> 10:49.708
A three-legged dog?

11:10.792 --> 11:12.583
Billy fucking Ayres.

11:16.875 --> 11:19.749
- Tall Paul.
- To what do we owe this honor?

11:19.750 --> 11:21.874
I'm here for a sit-down
with Uncle Dean.

11:21.875 --> 11:25.374
A sit-down with Uncle Dean?
Is that fucking right?

11:25.375 --> 11:26.999
You shoulda let us know
you were stopping by.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.707
I woulda washed me hair
for you, now.

11:28.708 --> 11:30.666
And I would've rolled out
the red carpet just for you.

11:30.667 --> 11:34.541
Piss off whilst you still got
boots to walk in, pretty boy.

11:34.542 --> 11:37.082
Now, I didn't come here
for a tear-up.

11:37.083 --> 11:39.499
If you wanna go that way,
I'll hit you so hard,

11:39.500 --> 11:40.791
you'll wake up pretty.

11:40.792 --> 11:42.124
Put the brakes on, boys.

11:42.125 --> 11:45.499
Let's move this along, Billy.

11:45.500 --> 11:47.499
Yeah, well, when you grow
a set of knackers,

11:47.500 --> 11:49.999
you know where
to find me, Billy boy!

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Hey?!

11:57.667 --> 11:59.583
Move along now with ya.

12:14.167 --> 12:16.582
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
this is your captain speaking.

12:16.583 --> 12:19.083
<i>We are about to make</i>
our final descent to...

12:33.625 --> 12:35.332
We still here?

12:35.333 --> 12:36.874
I'm just giving him
a couple minutes, all right?

12:36.875 --> 12:39.832
- Pussy.
- Easy.

12:39.833 --> 12:42.916
Uncle Dean? Open the door!

12:42.917 --> 12:44.042
What?!

12:45.583 --> 12:50.041
Can't even have a shite
without some bas...

12:50.042 --> 12:51.458
Hello.

12:53.125 --> 12:57.041
Well, hello to you.

12:57.042 --> 12:59.042
You are a sweet one, darling.

13:02.833 --> 13:04.957
- King Royston's boy?
- Yeah.

13:04.958 --> 13:07.124
The didicoy.

13:07.125 --> 13:10.332
That's right.

13:10.333 --> 13:12.957
I haven't seen you
around here in a while.

13:12.958 --> 13:14.457
Yeah, well...

13:14.458 --> 13:16.750
didn't think I was welcome.

13:18.917 --> 13:20.791
Where's my dog?

13:20.792 --> 13:23.041
Dog!

13:23.042 --> 13:25.292
Dog! Hey, dog!

13:26.875 --> 13:28.083
Dog!

13:30.625 --> 13:34.625
Ooh-ooh-ooh...
I put you off, yeah?

13:36.500 --> 13:37.832
- Here you go, Uncle D.
- Thank you.

13:37.833 --> 13:39.667
- Hi.
- Yourself?

13:41.333 --> 13:42.500
Dog!

13:47.292 --> 13:50.041
What do you want, son?

13:50.042 --> 13:52.666
A good man
is about to get mullered,

13:52.667 --> 13:54.082
and we need your help
to get him out.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.457
Well, a lot of good men
get mullered.

13:56.458 --> 13:58.499
Can't save 'em all.

13:58.500 --> 14:01.250
This was no man's.

14:02.583 --> 14:04.875
I was told it gets me
one cooperation.

14:07.792 --> 14:09.375
Well, now.

14:12.708 --> 14:15.832
Well, these boys
won't go to war for anybody.

14:15.833 --> 14:18.042
You're gonna have to scrap
for their allegiance.

14:19.042 --> 14:21.375
Call it on.

14:22.875 --> 14:23.875
Dog!

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
You all right?

14:33.001 --> 14:35.957
I'm fine. Is he?

14:35.958 --> 14:37.250
Next in line.

14:38.583 --> 14:40.333
I do the talking.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
Look into the camera.

14:50.500 --> 14:51.583
Four fingers.

14:54.333 --> 14:55.542
Thumb.

15:01.167 --> 15:02.667
Look into the camera.

15:05.583 --> 15:06.792
Four fingers.

15:10.167 --> 15:11.167
Thumb.

15:16.458 --> 15:17.749
Business or pleasure?

15:17.750 --> 15:20.333
- Pleasure.
- Loads of pleasure.

15:26.208 --> 15:27.874
That's quite a purse.

15:27.875 --> 15:29.708
It's the latest Vuitton.

15:31.375 --> 15:33.041
Looks expensive.

15:33.042 --> 15:34.958
It's nothing compared
to my shoe fetish.

15:50.458 --> 15:51.499
Enjoy your trip.

15:51.500 --> 15:53.375
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

16:17.375 --> 16:20.083
The Big Apple, baby!

16:21.750 --> 16:24.374
Hey, forget about it!

16:24.375 --> 16:27.249
- Cab?
- Already booked.

16:27.250 --> 16:28.416
Be a gentleman, would you?

16:28.417 --> 16:30.375
Milady.

16:32.167 --> 16:34.958
Smooth. Really smooth.

16:46.125 --> 16:49.166
24 hours? You guys
gotta check out Goattles.

16:49.167 --> 16:52.041
Stellar goat milk bar
in East Williamsburg.

16:52.042 --> 16:53.249
Wanted to invest in the place,

16:53.250 --> 16:54.582
but I got too many
other projects.

16:54.583 --> 16:56.291
I do cab for the networking.

16:56.292 --> 16:58.249
You gotta diversify
your entrepreneurial ventures

16:58.250 --> 16:59.874
if you wanna make it these days.

16:59.875 --> 17:01.832
I got my screen printing
business,

17:01.833 --> 17:04.499
virtual reality app
and bike shop I co-own.

17:04.500 --> 17:05.500
That's my main gig.

17:05.501 --> 17:07.082
Ride or Die Cyclery,

17:07.083 --> 17:09.415
largest selection of vintage
bikes on the East Coast.

17:09.416 --> 17:10.665
Yeah, well, you sound like
you got your fingers

17:10.666 --> 17:12.332
in a lot of little pies, mate.

17:12.333 --> 17:13.999
Everyone's trying
to make it rich.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.374
You just gotta try harder
than the next guy, right?

17:16.375 --> 17:19.124
Well, sometimes the riches just
fall out the back of a truck

17:19.125 --> 17:20.666
and land in your lap.

17:22.958 --> 17:24.832
- How far to Nas Stone?
- Not far.

17:24.833 --> 17:27.957
Nas Stone?
You guys ballers or gangsters?

17:27.958 --> 17:30.500
Well, we ain't ballers.

18:07.167 --> 18:09.332
I'm hearing good things
from Saul Gold about you.

18:09.333 --> 18:10.749
You bringing in
the business, girl.

18:10.750 --> 18:12.041
Things seem to be going well.

18:12.042 --> 18:13.499
But if I understand correctly,

18:13.500 --> 18:15.582
this is a little something
off the books.

18:15.583 --> 18:17.457
These are my associates,
Albert Hill

18:17.458 --> 18:19.538
and Charlie Cavendish-Scott.
Good to meet you, man.

18:27.083 --> 18:29.707
So... I got a backlog of orders

18:29.708 --> 18:31.500
stretching halfway
down the block.

18:33.042 --> 18:34.042
Charlie, the bag?

18:35.292 --> 18:37.166
Sorry, the... the what?

18:37.167 --> 18:38.208
The bag, Charlie.

18:40.500 --> 18:41.500
What bag?

18:43.208 --> 18:44.500
The bag.

18:56.208 --> 18:57.667
The bag!

18:58.875 --> 19:00.958
Charlie?

19:09.333 --> 19:10.333
How could you leave
the bag in the back

19:10.334 --> 19:12.166
of a fucking cab, Charlie?

19:12.167 --> 19:14.999
In what part of your warped
perception was this my fault

19:15.000 --> 19:16.874
more than it was yours?

19:16.875 --> 19:19.124
Charlie, the bag is there,
sat next to you on the seat.

19:19.125 --> 19:20.707
All you have to do
is hold onto it,

19:20.708 --> 19:22.291
carry it out of the cab
and into the store, Charlie!

19:22.292 --> 19:23.541
Bollocks.

19:23.542 --> 19:26.666
Just... it was just bad luck.

19:26.667 --> 19:29.249
Okay, can... can we just
please just concentrate

19:29.250 --> 19:30.530
on getting it back now? Can we?

19:32.583 --> 19:34.416
Chloe, what did
the cab firm say?

19:34.417 --> 19:36.582
"Thanks for your inquiry,
one of our team

19:36.583 --> 19:39.249
will get back to you
within 48 hours."

19:39.250 --> 19:41.333
We don't have 48 hours.

19:53.250 --> 19:55.041
Hello, love.

19:55.042 --> 19:56.874
I got a bad feeling
about this one, Vic.

19:56.875 --> 19:59.457
About what?

19:59.458 --> 20:02.292
The heist. The gold.

20:03.500 --> 20:05.499
- Spain.
- No, no, no, no.

20:05.500 --> 20:08.332
Nothing to worry about.
I got it handled.

20:08.333 --> 20:11.832
A week from now,
we'll be coastal royalty.

20:11.833 --> 20:16.292
Tapas and sangria
for all eternity.

20:19.042 --> 20:20.874
What about his schooling?

20:20.875 --> 20:24.166
Well, they got schools
in Costa del Sol.

20:24.167 --> 20:25.832
Private schools.

20:25.833 --> 20:27.624
Well, what about
all my friends here?

20:27.625 --> 20:29.374
You'll make new friends, son.

20:29.375 --> 20:32.874
I'll take you to see
Real Madrid at the Bernebéu,

20:32.875 --> 20:37.041
and maybe get you
a summer job...

20:37.042 --> 20:38.833
as a bullfighter.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.333
Cool.

20:46.333 --> 20:49.249
Stop filling my son's head
with your nonsense, Vic.

20:49.250 --> 20:51.666
You wanna stay
in this shithole forever?

20:51.667 --> 20:56.458
This is our shot. Trust me.

21:12.042 --> 21:14.083
Eddie Flowers.

21:15.500 --> 21:17.332
The tongueless wonder.

21:17.333 --> 21:19.416
Still playing with knives
after what they done to ya?

21:19.417 --> 21:20.999
Leave him be.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.332
- Lily Hill.
- What do you want?

21:24.333 --> 21:25.791
Well, I was just passing by.

21:25.792 --> 21:27.832
I thought I'd pop in
and pay my respects.

21:27.833 --> 21:29.707
You'd paid 'em.

21:29.708 --> 21:33.166
How's life treating Vic?

21:33.167 --> 21:34.832
You know he hasn't
written to me.

21:34.833 --> 21:36.249
Not even a postcard.

21:36.250 --> 21:38.125
I'm sure he'll catch up
with you one day.

21:39.958 --> 21:42.166
How's that young lad of yours?

21:42.167 --> 21:43.999
That gang of his?

21:44.000 --> 21:45.541
They're keeping
their noses clean, are they?

21:45.542 --> 21:47.875
- As a whistle.
- Good.

21:49.625 --> 21:51.375
Good.

21:53.042 --> 21:55.125
That room's for staff.

21:58.500 --> 22:02.374
You know, I never could
smell the roses, Mrs. Hill.

22:02.375 --> 22:05.042
But I could always sniff out
a rotten apple.

22:06.708 --> 22:10.666
Eddie...
show the gentleman the door.

22:10.667 --> 22:12.167
There's no need.

22:14.833 --> 22:16.417
Send my regards to Albert.

22:18.167 --> 22:19.832
Right, okay,
we need to find this guy.

22:19.833 --> 22:21.582
Now, what do we know?
Just about everything.

22:21.583 --> 22:23.582
He practically downloaded us
his life story.

22:23.583 --> 22:26.041
- Goat milk bar.
- Screen printing business.

22:26.042 --> 22:27.875
The virtual reality app.

22:30.458 --> 22:32.000
The bike shop!

22:34.167 --> 22:35.916
- Shit.
- Where's the bag?

22:35.917 --> 22:37.999
What bag?

22:38.000 --> 22:39.499
What do I look like?

22:39.500 --> 22:41.749
Well, you're 5'10-ish,
dark, cropped hair.

22:41.750 --> 22:43.582
Hazelnut eyes.
Do I look like a dick?

22:43.583 --> 22:45.332
- A dick?
- Does he look like a dick?

22:45.333 --> 22:48.291
No. No, I don't think
you look like a dick.

22:48.292 --> 22:49.874
Then why are you
jerking him off like a dick?

22:49.875 --> 22:51.874
Okay, okay, okay!

22:51.875 --> 22:53.541
I did have your gold...
I mean bag.

22:53.542 --> 22:54.624
But I don't anymore.

22:54.625 --> 22:55.832
Right, so who has it now?

22:55.833 --> 22:58.999
I... I put it up for auction.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.666
Who did you put it up
for auction with, who?!

23:00.667 --> 23:03.457
- The Xiang Sisters!
- Not good.

23:03.458 --> 23:05.791
Who are the Xiang Sisters?
They sound hot.

23:05.792 --> 23:07.374
Black market fences
who auction anything

23:07.375 --> 23:09.083
from kidneys
to rocket launchers.

23:10.667 --> 23:12.499
- Get me my gold bag.
- I can't, I can't, I swear!

23:12.500 --> 23:14.124
- Get me my gold bag!
- I swear I can't.

23:14.125 --> 23:15.916
All submissions
to the auction are final.

23:15.917 --> 23:17.458
But you can get us in.

23:18.708 --> 23:20.207
- Get us in!
- Okay, okay!

23:20.208 --> 23:22.333
I can... I can get you
into the auction.

23:23.708 --> 23:24.875
Well... thank you.

23:42.417 --> 23:45.707
This time... I want Windrush.

23:45.708 --> 23:49.749
I need the best cleaner,
nothing less.

23:49.750 --> 23:51.957
Windrush still not here.

23:51.958 --> 23:56.125
But I can introduce you
to the Murphy's Law Lads.

24:08.750 --> 24:10.791
Right!

24:10.792 --> 24:13.167
A scrap for our allegiance.
Mushy!

24:15.333 --> 24:18.332
- And... Tall Paul!
- Yeah!

24:18.333 --> 24:20.582
Billy here fights
for our cooperation!

24:20.583 --> 24:22.499
- Both?
- Your dad

24:22.500 --> 24:24.666
would have knocked the shite
out of both of 'em.

24:24.667 --> 24:28.166
- Come on, Billy.
- Right!

24:28.167 --> 24:30.375
Let's be having ya!

24:32.125 --> 24:35.917
Wait... wait...

24:38.792 --> 24:40.374
Come on, Billy.

24:40.375 --> 24:42.000
Do your worst!

24:44.875 --> 24:47.500
Go on there! Go on!

24:59.250 --> 25:00.500
Yes, Billy!

25:02.667 --> 25:04.500
Let me have a look at that.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.082
You are King Royston's boy.

25:08.083 --> 25:11.625
We shall break
your man out for you, son.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.833
<i>The number you have dialed</i>
is not in service.

25:34.208 --> 25:35.500
Come on, Albert.

25:39.125 --> 25:40.833
Where are you?

25:45.833 --> 25:47.916
Eddie, could you come
to the house please, love?

25:47.917 --> 25:50.708
I need you to take a delivery
to Father John's for me.

25:59.167 --> 26:01.083
Let's go.

26:02.500 --> 26:04.749
Tommy... Tommy, you're
gonna be with me, right?

26:04.750 --> 26:07.499
Right, then.
Let's get Norman out.

26:07.500 --> 26:11.332
You're a game lad, Billy.
But we're going in heavy.

26:11.333 --> 26:13.166
So you stay here
and look after the lass.

26:13.167 --> 26:14.207
I'm going in with ya.

26:14.208 --> 26:17.833
I am not asking you, son.

26:21.792 --> 26:22.792
Good lad.

26:25.750 --> 26:29.333
Lady Carnation, bless us.

26:30.708 --> 26:32.666
Lovely, great.

26:32.667 --> 26:35.082
And now, we are blessed.

26:35.083 --> 26:36.958
- Come on, Dad!
- Right.

26:38.542 --> 26:41.457
Let us make some noise, boys.

26:41.458 --> 26:42.874
Yes.

26:42.875 --> 26:44.583
Come on!

27:10.500 --> 27:12.749
What's a didicoy?

27:12.750 --> 27:16.749
I heard Uncle Dean
call you that at the campsite.

27:16.750 --> 27:18.791
- A half gypsy.
- Yeah?

27:18.792 --> 27:20.833
Which half?

27:28.583 --> 27:30.375
My old man.

27:31.875 --> 27:33.874
He was a traveler from up north.

27:33.875 --> 27:35.042
My mum...

27:38.333 --> 27:40.458
she was a punk singer
from the East End.

27:42.667 --> 27:44.332
He was working as a bouncer
at one of her shows

27:44.333 --> 27:45.500
when they met.

27:47.958 --> 27:49.333
Knocked her up.

29:49.208 --> 29:51.791
Problem was,
he was promised the daughter

29:51.792 --> 29:54.957
of another traveler family...

29:54.958 --> 29:57.457
and they didn't take too kindly
to him breaking up the wedding

29:57.458 --> 29:59.083
and shacking up with some...

30:01.583 --> 30:04.250
some settler slut.

30:09.208 --> 30:11.499
The night I was born,
he had a little run-in

30:11.500 --> 30:14.208
with his betrothed's kin.

30:16.208 --> 30:18.167
Took 12 blades to the gut.

30:19.875 --> 30:21.499
I'm so sorry, Billy.

30:21.500 --> 30:23.416
Yeah, well, I'm not.

30:23.417 --> 30:25.042
Never knew the guy.

30:36.125 --> 30:38.792
Okay, I'm done playing!

30:45.792 --> 30:47.082
Who the fuck are you?

30:47.083 --> 30:49.042
I'm Uncle Dean, pal.

31:02.917 --> 31:05.207
So you're a single girl.

31:05.208 --> 31:06.667
Or available.

31:17.292 --> 31:19.957
Norman, mate.
Geez, you all right?

31:19.958 --> 31:21.999
Those bastards
couldn't break me, boy.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.500
Come here.

31:27.833 --> 31:29.917
Job done, lads!

31:32.708 --> 31:34.583
I bloody love Pikeys.

31:36.625 --> 31:38.582
Aren't you sweet?

31:38.583 --> 31:40.333
You have impeccable taste!

32:06.792 --> 32:09.082
Private party.

32:09.083 --> 32:10.332
Okay.

32:10.333 --> 32:11.750
Okay.

32:19.708 --> 32:21.832
Bandit territory.

32:21.833 --> 32:24.166
- Keep an eye out.
- I'll be at the bar.

32:24.167 --> 32:26.500
It's the best vantage point, Al.

32:43.500 --> 32:47.332
I'm Maggie Xiang,
and this is our house.

32:47.333 --> 32:49.082
You are?

32:49.083 --> 32:52.832
My name's Chloe Koen
and this is my client, Mr. Hill.

32:52.833 --> 32:55.291
And what are
your client's interests?

32:55.292 --> 32:56.692
On this occasion,
precious metals.

32:58.917 --> 33:00.157
Then he won't be disappointed.

33:02.083 --> 33:03.250
Booth number three.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.499
All sales are final

33:25.500 --> 33:27.583
and payable immediately
after sale.

33:47.500 --> 33:50.332
In lot four, we have
a triple-headed vibrator

33:50.333 --> 33:52.832
embellished with 100 white
and pink sapphires,

33:52.833 --> 33:54.666
pearls, and diamonds.

33:54.667 --> 33:57.667
Bidding starts at $100,000.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.124
What can I get you there, sir?

34:03.125 --> 34:04.333
I, um...

34:07.125 --> 34:08.998
virgin mojito.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
Sure thing.

34:17.208 --> 34:19.873
A must-have
for every girl in town.

34:19.875 --> 34:22.041
A purse made
of solid gold ingots.

34:22.042 --> 34:23.667
Place your bids!

34:46.625 --> 34:48.331
Motek!

34:48.333 --> 34:50.123
Heimels!
What are you doing here?

34:50.125 --> 34:51.623
Double tequila shots all around.

34:51.625 --> 34:53.666
What are <i>you</i>
doing here, Charlie?

34:53.667 --> 34:55.748
You're a long way
from home, dog.

34:55.750 --> 34:58.457
International business, fellas.

34:58.458 --> 35:01.666
And you, you got
your eye on anything?

35:01.667 --> 35:04.708
Diamonds, bubba.
Always diamonds.

35:16.458 --> 35:20.458
Wire details for
immediate transfer, $350,000.

35:32.500 --> 35:34.582
What else have you got in there?

35:34.583 --> 35:35.999
Don't you know
it's rude to ask a girl

35:36.000 --> 35:37.292
what she's got in her purse?

35:54.917 --> 35:56.999
Business is done, Mr. Hill.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.707
Time to relax.

35:59.708 --> 36:01.541
Well, thank you very much
for your hospitality,

36:01.542 --> 36:03.332
but we actually have
a plane to catch.

36:03.333 --> 36:04.708
Stop them!

36:13.417 --> 36:15.207
Hyuh!

36:15.208 --> 36:17.624
Looks like you've
got problems, Charlie.

36:17.625 --> 36:18.875
No shit, Abel.

36:26.500 --> 36:29.916
We do owe you, Charlie.

36:29.917 --> 36:31.166
This is a robbery!

36:31.167 --> 36:33.499
Get me that diamond, Balabusta.

36:33.500 --> 36:35.333
I think this belongs to us.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.832
Sorry for theshtunk
with Saul Gold, Albert.

36:39.833 --> 36:41.999
I hope he didn't pull
your trousers down too far.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.457
Don't worry about it.
I'd say we're even.

36:43.458 --> 36:44.832
Taxi!

36:44.833 --> 36:46.166
Don't even think
about it, Schmeckel.

36:46.167 --> 36:47.625
Brothers...

37:01.833 --> 37:03.500
My man!

37:07.417 --> 37:08.958
So...

37:11.167 --> 37:12.457
How you want your scrilla?

37:12.458 --> 37:13.833
Cash.

37:54.458 --> 37:58.000
If you've trampled my azaleas,
you're gonna be sorry.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.166
Lily, hold up.

38:00.167 --> 38:01.583
It's me, Norman Gordon.

38:04.708 --> 38:07.292
Jesus, Norman, you could've
just rung the doorbell.

38:08.667 --> 38:11.958
I was... hoping not
to wake you, love.

38:15.083 --> 38:16.999
You all right, mate?

38:17.000 --> 38:18.832
Spot of bother, Lil.

38:18.833 --> 38:20.874
I couldn't go to the hospital
on this one.

38:20.875 --> 38:22.916
I'll get you a glass of water.

38:22.917 --> 38:25.208
How 'bout a splash
of something stronger?

38:33.583 --> 38:36.041
Well, you won't be winning
any beauty pageants, Norm,

38:36.042 --> 38:37.999
that's for sure.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.333
Just to have a shot
at entering is all I ask.

38:48.833 --> 38:49.958
Norman?

38:52.167 --> 38:54.000
Earth to Norman?

38:57.333 --> 38:59.916
Sorry, love, heh.

38:59.917 --> 39:01.083
Must be a bit tired.

39:04.292 --> 39:05.750
Well, you rest up.

39:07.625 --> 39:09.874
Sorry, love.

39:09.875 --> 39:11.457
- Can you manage?
- Yeah.

39:11.458 --> 39:13.500
Thank you.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.160
I'll check in on you later.

39:35.125 --> 39:37.332
- What's in there now?
- Go on, go on.

39:37.333 --> 39:40.000
Come on. Come on.

39:49.333 --> 39:54.332
I figure you'll be wanting
what's in this wee pouch?

39:54.333 --> 39:56.082
And those readies are all yours.

39:56.083 --> 39:59.332
Well, I was thinking...

39:59.333 --> 40:03.167
about putting some Roman columns
outside my caravan.

40:09.833 --> 40:11.832
You are all right with us, son.

40:11.833 --> 40:13.499
- Thank you, Uncle Dean.
- Enjoy.

40:13.500 --> 40:14.792
Thank you.

40:25.458 --> 40:28.583
We got our diamonds back, baby!
Yes!

40:36.708 --> 40:39.792
All right, boys,
don't stop till you've found it.

41:01.167 --> 41:02.833
Vic? What happened, mate?

41:05.333 --> 41:07.541
Get yourself in there.
Mind your head.

41:07.542 --> 41:09.916
Horrible bastards,
what'd they do to ya?

41:09.917 --> 41:13.332
Man, horrible's
not the word, Hate 'Em.

41:13.333 --> 41:16.583
Being in the hole
is incredibly...

41:23.750 --> 41:25.667
enlightening.

41:35.958 --> 41:39.374
- Anything to declare?
- Yeah.

41:39.375 --> 41:41.000
Don't go to New York.
