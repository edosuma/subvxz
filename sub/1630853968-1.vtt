00:31.694 --> 00:33.946
Yesterday, it was a disaster.

00:35.949 --> 00:37.783
Today, catastrophe.

00:40.412 --> 00:44.123
Our beloved New Orleans,
where Katrina hit hardest.

00:47.627 --> 00:49.421
Two of the levees that held back

00:49.504 --> 00:51.714
the waters of Lake Pontchartrain
have cracked.

00:53.550 --> 00:56.927
And as the water rises in the city,
there are no immediate answers

00:57.012 --> 00:59.763
as to how and when it will be
pumped out again,

00:59.848 --> 01:01.641
or what will remain.

01:03.768 --> 01:08.481
Everything that New Orleans ever was,
in danger of drowning tonight.

05:00.255 --> 05:02.716
Congratulations, Naquanta.

05:03.799 --> 05:04.801
That's me.

05:07.761 --> 05:11.682
Before the storm, there was nothing like
being around my family.

05:17.104 --> 05:18.397
Especially my cousins.

05:25.237 --> 05:26.907
I still remember the last time.

05:29.533 --> 05:33.497
It's August 2005,
and summer was coming to an end,

05:33.579 --> 05:34.872
so that meant one thing.

05:35.456 --> 05:39.126
A back-to-school celebration at Tina's
with all of my cousins.

05:40.921 --> 05:46.091
You see, Tina's house was the hangout spot
for all of the children in my family,

05:46.176 --> 05:49.638
mainly because she had four kids herself
who all were my best friends.

05:51.723 --> 05:54.225
I still remember that weekend
like yesterday,

05:54.308 --> 05:58.647
me and all my cousins just outside,
playing, joking,

05:59.689 --> 06:01.441
and laughing without a care in the world.

06:06.321 --> 06:08.990
Tina made her signature meal,
gravy and rice.

06:12.743 --> 06:14.788
I can still remember what it smelled like.

06:23.088 --> 06:26.423
We must have played outside for hours
until the streetlights came on.

06:33.306 --> 06:37.269
Once we got inside and ate,
we just all piled up in one room

06:37.352 --> 06:41.105
to enjoy each other's presence
before our parents came to pick us up.

06:41.189 --> 06:42.273
It's your boy!

06:45.276 --> 06:47.027
-I'll see y'all later.
- I never would've thought

06:47.112 --> 06:49.531
that would be our last time together
in that house.

07:22.354 --> 07:23.272
All right.

07:25.650 --> 07:27.319
Since the storm,

07:28.485 --> 07:31.655
it seems like everybody just moved on.

07:35.826 --> 07:41.498
In America, especially during disaster,
Black children are not even a thought.

07:44.085 --> 07:45.962
Hurricane Katrina was no different.

07:48.507 --> 07:51.425
-See, it's already got a call...
- After losing so much,

07:51.510 --> 07:54.846
why wouldn't anyone ask if we were okay?

08:00.851 --> 08:03.647
Nobody ever asked the children
how they were doing.

08:17.327 --> 08:18.245
So, I am.

08:21.623 --> 08:24.417
-Got the chargers and stuff?
-There's one in the back.

08:31.632 --> 08:33.009
-Yeah.
-All right?

08:33.093 --> 08:35.428
Cierra, Katrina Babies, take one.

08:39.599 --> 08:43.227
Lolly, Katrina Babies,
interview, take one.

08:43.854 --> 08:45.730
I was 11 years old,

08:45.813 --> 08:48.984
and the first thing I can remember,
I was knocked out asleep, man.

08:49.067 --> 08:50.401
The first thing I could remember

08:50.485 --> 08:53.905
was just feet running down
the hallway...

08:53.988 --> 08:55.531
and my mom was like,

08:55.615 --> 08:58.784
"Get up, get up, get up.
We got to go, we got to go."

08:58.869 --> 09:01.746
Something like that is really hard
for you to forget.

09:01.829 --> 09:04.707
Friday, I was at school,
walking the hallways with my friends.

09:04.790 --> 09:07.167
By Monday,
I was on top of the fucking roof.

09:07.252 --> 09:09.920
My mom's home crying.
My grandmother's home crying.

09:10.004 --> 09:11.631
Our house is destroyed.

09:11.714 --> 09:14.967
Like, it was just too much.
Even though I'm young and, you know,

09:15.051 --> 09:17.219
it's not like I'm stressing
how my parents were stressing,

09:17.303 --> 09:21.057
but I just was...
I just wasn't comfortable.

09:21.141 --> 09:24.602
I couldn't... I couldn't think properly.

09:29.107 --> 09:30.400
No.

09:30.482 --> 09:33.861
I started interviewing people,
and I didn't know what I was doing,

09:33.945 --> 09:37.699
but I was just like,
"This is a story that needs to be told."

09:38.574 --> 09:39.867
All right. We rolling?

09:39.951 --> 09:40.869
Yeah.

09:41.661 --> 09:45.331
All right. Katrina Babies, Betty Buckles,

09:46.041 --> 09:47.833
Betty "Stay Ready" Buckles, take one.

09:49.001 --> 09:51.337
Why you look so scared and serious?

09:51.421 --> 09:53.590
-I don't know. I mean, I'm just--
-It don't got to be scary.

09:53.672 --> 09:54.674
I ain't scared.

09:54.757 --> 09:58.135
All right.
So, just... just introduce yourself,

09:59.221 --> 10:00.388
your name...

10:02.056 --> 10:04.516
your name and who you are.

10:06.185 --> 10:09.105
-Oh, okay. What you mean, who I am?
-Yeah.

10:09.188 --> 10:11.690
-Like your... your mama?
-Yeah.

10:17.529 --> 10:20.575
Dad, as a parent,
what you remember going through

10:20.658 --> 10:23.953
as Hurricane Katrina was approaching,
just like the whole process

10:24.036 --> 10:26.038
-of Hurricane Katrina?
-Good question, good question.

10:26.121 --> 10:28.749
'Cause, like, me and my wife and family,

10:28.834 --> 10:31.711
we had decided at first
that we was gonna all stay.

10:31.795 --> 10:34.548
You know, we was just gonna ride this out.

10:34.630 --> 10:39.301
But that morning, the last day of,
our last day to get out,

10:40.053 --> 10:42.805
my wife had a change of mind,
and she said,

10:42.889 --> 10:47.060
"I think we better leave."
So, I wasn't in no argument mood.

10:47.142 --> 10:49.646
I say, "Well, okay. Let's pack up,
and let's leave."

10:50.814 --> 10:54.651
Well, I had been hearing about the storm
for, like, about a whole week or two.

10:54.734 --> 10:58.655
Then, Ray Nagin came on, and Ray Nagin say

10:59.238 --> 11:00.907
to don't play with the storm,

11:00.991 --> 11:04.411
to please get your family
and get out of here.

11:05.453 --> 11:08.456
So, I told your daddy,
"We got to leave. We got to leave."

11:09.290 --> 11:12.210
Ladies and gentlemen,
I wish I had better news for you

11:12.293 --> 11:16.673
but we are facing a storm
that most of us have feared.

11:16.756 --> 11:21.427
I do not want to create panic,
but I do want the citizens to understand

11:21.510 --> 11:25.472
that this is very serious,
and it's of the highest nature,

11:25.556 --> 11:28.768
and it's... that's why we've taken
this unprecedented move.

11:34.315 --> 11:36.025
We're not able to get up and just go.

11:36.108 --> 11:39.487
We don't have transportation.
I mean, we living paycheck to paycheck.

11:39.571 --> 11:42.949
I mean, it ain't like we're just able
to get up or just leave.

11:45.076 --> 11:46.285
Waiting on the storm?

11:48.621 --> 11:50.581
-You going to wait for the storm?
-No.

11:50.665 --> 11:52.541
-Hurricane.
-What's up? People getting ready

11:52.626 --> 11:54.711
for the hurricane like it's nothing.

11:57.964 --> 11:59.925
My mindset on hurricanes,

12:00.007 --> 12:03.595
my thoughts toward them
were they were always gonna come--

12:04.011 --> 12:05.889
like, seemed like they were gonna
come for New Orleans,

12:05.971 --> 12:07.849
and then turn at the last second.

12:07.932 --> 12:09.726
Well, my grandma always said,

12:09.809 --> 12:12.938
like, the Lower Ninth Ward is, like,
below sea level.

12:13.020 --> 12:15.273
Like, we can't stay here.

12:15.356 --> 12:18.734
We packed, and I just remember...

12:18.818 --> 12:23.989
there was, like, something different,
even though we didn't know it then.

12:24.073 --> 12:26.825
I remember packing my bag

12:26.910 --> 12:31.288
and putting in some, like, pictures
that I had hanging up in my bedroom,

12:31.372 --> 12:34.917
which is not something
that you would normally do

12:35.001 --> 12:36.419
when you think you're coming right back.

12:36.502 --> 12:38.004
You know, we didn't even
take them serious.

12:38.088 --> 12:39.047
I remember one time,

12:39.381 --> 12:41.883
I was in the Lafitte Projects
for a hurricane,

12:41.966 --> 12:43.801
and they had a hurricane block party.

12:43.884 --> 12:46.179
Like, they really had a DJ.
Everybody in the project

12:46.262 --> 12:47.972
was right there,
dancing and whatnot, eating.

12:48.055 --> 12:49.765
And, like, yeah,
the hurricane come tomorrow,

12:49.850 --> 12:51.725
so, we gonna, you know,
we're gonna cut up right now,

12:51.810 --> 12:53.228
you know, just in case
something happened.

12:53.310 --> 12:56.648
But we always knew it wasn't gonna happen.
Nothing was gonna happen at all.

12:56.731 --> 12:59.484
-We was gonna be good.
-You know, my grandma was like,

13:00.277 --> 13:03.280
"Pack up some clothes.
Just pack up some clothes."

13:03.363 --> 13:05.698
"Get everything you need,
pack up some clothes."

13:06.408 --> 13:12.037
I definitely think that me
and, like, my friends,

13:12.122 --> 13:13.914
we were just, again,

13:13.998 --> 13:17.001
thinking that this was like
a quick one-two,

13:17.085 --> 13:19.546
going for two or three days,
and you come right back.

13:19.628 --> 13:23.466
So, it was still that... that innocence
there and that sense of, like,

13:24.509 --> 13:27.595
not really thinking
that this was gonna be a big deal.

13:27.678 --> 13:30.891
We was in the Lafitte Projects,

13:30.973 --> 13:35.519
and me and my brothers was playing outside
with the other kids.

13:36.562 --> 13:40.525
And all I could feel was, like,
this real cold wind.

13:40.608 --> 13:44.653
It was so windy. So, so windy.
And it was, like, real, real cold.

13:44.738 --> 13:48.449
I went to church that Sunday,
the day before the storm, you know?

13:48.532 --> 13:50.784
And the priest was like...
I'll never forget this.

13:50.869 --> 13:52.077
The priest looked my dad in the eye.

13:52.162 --> 13:54.080
He was like,
"Yeah, y'all evacuating today, huh?"

13:54.163 --> 13:55.831
He said, "Nah."
And the priest just looked.

13:55.916 --> 13:58.083
He just had this look in his eye,
and we was walking off.

13:58.168 --> 13:59.294
I looked back,

13:59.376 --> 14:02.004
and the priest was just looking like,
you know... like he was confused.

14:02.087 --> 14:04.674
And I will never forget
that day in my life, dude.

14:05.717 --> 14:09.888
That Sunday, we woke up,
and my mama was all over the place,

14:09.971 --> 14:13.349
like, "Yo, we leaving."
Like, "Yo, like, I'm not asking you."

14:13.432 --> 14:14.892
"I'm telling you. We're leaving."

14:14.976 --> 14:18.438
"We're getting the fuck out of here,
and we're going somewhere."

14:18.520 --> 14:22.191
My mom is that person that,
like, she has dreams,

14:22.275 --> 14:24.986
and then sometimes
those dreams, like,

14:25.069 --> 14:28.240
manifest into something
like, you know, within the family.

14:28.322 --> 14:29.533
Like, she's real spiritual.

14:29.615 --> 14:33.911
So, when she said that, when she's like,

14:33.995 --> 14:37.414
"God is telling us to leave,"
nobody questioned it.

14:37.499 --> 14:39.209
It's like, "Yo, we got to go."

14:40.167 --> 14:43.546
"We getting out of here.
Y'all start getting ready. We got to go."

14:43.630 --> 14:45.381
And then everybody
just started getting up.

14:45.465 --> 14:48.176
The children didn't seem to be worried
about the storm

14:48.801 --> 14:51.972
'cause I guess they didn't really realize
how serious the storm was.

14:52.889 --> 14:54.265
We got rushed into the car,

14:54.348 --> 14:57.602
and we only took like
a weekend's worth of clothes.

14:59.228 --> 15:00.564
We had evacuated before,

15:00.646 --> 15:03.066
but there was something surreal
about this time.

15:05.652 --> 15:07.487
The city of New Orleans needs
to be prepared

15:07.570 --> 15:09.406
for what could be as high

15:09.488 --> 15:14.451
and is right now as high
as a 175-mile-an-hour hurricane.

15:14.536 --> 15:17.789
There can be no doubt now
that we're talking about...

15:19.164 --> 15:21.543
-levees that will overflow.
- Right.

15:24.129 --> 15:27.424
The city seemed to be in,
like, a frantic state.

15:27.506 --> 15:31.552
People at the gas station for hours.
The gas stations are jam-packed.

15:31.635 --> 15:33.721
People are cursing, people are yelling,

15:33.805 --> 15:39.311
and everybody just has a look
of uncertainty and fear on their faces.

16:07.547 --> 16:10.008
You know, it sounded like
the apocalypse was outside,

16:10.090 --> 16:11.508
but I still was ignoring it.

16:11.593 --> 16:13.219
And then the electricity went out.

16:13.845 --> 16:15.764
So, I'm just sitting there,
listening to all this rain.

16:15.846 --> 16:19.684
I hear, like,
all type of animals outside, crying, too.

16:19.767 --> 16:21.310
Rain, wind, and all that.

16:21.394 --> 16:24.356
So, I go into bed with my dad
'cause, you know, I'm scared.

16:24.438 --> 16:29.194
But I remember
you can see out... see out the house

16:29.276 --> 16:32.529
'cause we had a screen door
on the side of the house.

16:32.614 --> 16:35.115
And I'm just looking
at all these things fly by,

16:35.200 --> 16:38.954
and trees looking like they about
to come out of the ground.

16:39.036 --> 16:42.374
And that's when I really realized,
"Oh, this ain't a game," you know?

16:42.456 --> 16:44.124
I remember it was real, real late.

16:44.209 --> 16:47.087
Like, it had to be, like, almost midnight.

16:47.170 --> 16:52.091
And I was up with my mom
and, like, my brothers,

16:52.174 --> 16:56.762
and we heard a loud, loud noise,
like a boom,

16:56.847 --> 16:58.765
like a bang, something like that.
It was loud.

16:58.847 --> 16:59.765
What was it?

17:01.600 --> 17:03.811
It was the levees. They broke.

17:03.895 --> 17:06.939
And... I don't know.

17:07.023 --> 17:12.320
Like, then it just got all calm,
and then, I just went to sleep.

17:13.070 --> 17:14.989
And then, I woke up

17:15.073 --> 17:20.662
to one of my uncle's friends
banging on my mom's door.

17:21.662 --> 17:25.958
And she walked outside,
and it was like, flooded.

17:29.503 --> 17:31.547
As the storm was approaching
New Orleans...

17:33.592 --> 17:35.385
my family and I were on the road.

17:36.760 --> 17:40.473
What should have been a two-hour drive
turned into 13 hours

17:41.558 --> 17:43.602
because of the insane traffic.

17:43.684 --> 17:46.521
My parents were just so anxious and tense.

17:50.274 --> 17:52.818
We were hot, and it was dark as hell.

18:04.247 --> 18:07.334
I remember us stopping in this really,
really rural,

18:07.416 --> 18:09.752
creepy southern Louisiana town.

18:11.755 --> 18:14.423
They had opened up the flea market
to be shelter

18:14.506 --> 18:17.092
for people that were coming
from New Orleans.

18:20.138 --> 18:23.183
I don't know if it was because
of how exhausted I was

18:23.266 --> 18:26.603
or maybe I was a little bit scared
at the time.

18:26.685 --> 18:28.647
I don't know, but it's like a blur.

18:29.813 --> 18:32.400
I just remember us going to a corner,

18:32.483 --> 18:36.488
and all the kids laid down
on this hard-ass floor.

18:37.239 --> 18:40.532
And the whole time,
I was thinking about Tina and my cousins.

18:42.285 --> 18:43.870
They had stayed in New Orleans.

18:50.877 --> 18:53.003
My dreams must have been so crazy
that night.

19:12.983 --> 19:18.612
I remember we woke up,
and the press was there.

19:18.697 --> 19:21.032
Like, you know,
the local news station was there.

19:22.283 --> 19:25.703
And I remember they pulled out

19:26.370 --> 19:30.332
a television, almost like, you know,
almost like in the '90s,

19:30.417 --> 19:32.668
when you were in school and, like,
it was a free day,

19:32.752 --> 19:34.838
you know, and the teacher rolled
the television out.

19:34.921 --> 19:39.050
They, like, rolled the television out
for us to see the news.

19:39.134 --> 19:40.718
And I remember

19:41.594 --> 19:46.641
seeing, like, New Orleans underwater.

19:54.441 --> 19:59.404
And... and then I saw
that Circle Food Store was underwater.

20:00.947 --> 20:04.199
That was Tina's neighborhood.
That was my cousin's neighborhood.

20:06.577 --> 20:08.497
As a child, I'm just like,

20:08.580 --> 20:11.582
"This neighborhood is underwater,
so are my cousins."

20:34.022 --> 20:36.399
I remember, I asked one of the adults,

20:37.192 --> 20:39.778
"Wait. Like, if all of this is underwater,

20:39.861 --> 20:43.740
what happened to the people
who stayed behind? Like, where are they?"

20:43.822 --> 20:46.200
And, you know, she was like...

20:46.284 --> 20:49.286
like, looked me dead
in my eye as a kid and said,

20:49.370 --> 20:52.082
"Everybody who stayed
in New Orleans is dead!"

20:52.164 --> 20:55.669
And I just started crying,
like instantly. I just started crying.

20:56.503 --> 20:59.130
Looking at the TV screen
and her saying that,

20:59.213 --> 21:00.297
it seemed like it was true.

21:05.679 --> 21:06.972
Police operator...

21:07.722 --> 21:10.933
I need someone out here, ma'am.
I'm gonna die in this attic.

21:14.562 --> 21:20.109
The water's started rising in the attic,
ma'am, and I'mma drown in the attic.

21:23.363 --> 21:25.781
Is there any way you can get
to the roof if need be?

21:25.864 --> 21:27.408
I'm stuck in the attic,

21:27.492 --> 21:29.451
me and my little sister here,
and my mama,

21:29.536 --> 21:31.121
and we got water in our whole house.

21:35.666 --> 21:38.170
We're, like, under nine feet of water
here, and we're trying to get out.

21:38.253 --> 21:42.715
We have a baby.
There's five of us. We're very frightened.

21:45.050 --> 21:47.387
We opened the attic.
We punched a hole in the attic.

21:47.469 --> 21:49.723
But the helicopter keeps passing us.

21:50.682 --> 21:53.643
The helicopters, they'll pass over us,
but they won't stop.

21:58.647 --> 22:01.359
We sitting on the porch,
looking at the water rising up,

22:02.152 --> 22:05.696
and we don't have no way to get out
or nothing. It's just coming up.

22:17.584 --> 22:21.796
In New Orleans,
I think that one thing that we had

22:21.879 --> 22:24.799
to our advantage is family...

22:26.635 --> 22:30.889
and the warmth of, you know, of a home.

22:31.681 --> 22:35.060
Our houses are very cozy.
Our hospitality is very good.

22:35.142 --> 22:36.977
The houses smell like good food.

22:41.066 --> 22:43.568
I know what Tina's house was for me.

22:44.653 --> 22:47.446
And I knew how comfortable
and how warm it was.

22:47.531 --> 22:48.573
You know what I'm saying?

22:54.329 --> 22:55.996
This is one of my favorite ones.

22:59.667 --> 23:06.550
And that's me, Quentin, Kiyara,
Shirley, and that's my mom in the back.

23:06.633 --> 23:08.093
And this is at the house.

23:09.301 --> 23:12.388
This is at one of the houses
that Tina stayed in before Katrina.

23:13.849 --> 23:16.850
As you can see, they got the wood panels,
like, just...

23:20.771 --> 23:22.190
- Hello?
-What's up, Tina?

23:22.898 --> 23:24.692
Hey, man. What's going on?

23:25.610 --> 23:28.154
I hadn't seen Tina
and my cousins in years.

23:40.624 --> 23:44.045
I could smell Tina's gravy and rice
all the way to Shreveport.

23:59.019 --> 24:01.104
-What's happening?
-Hey, baby.

24:01.186 --> 24:03.899
-What's up?
-I said, Lord, I sure hope...

24:03.982 --> 24:06.650
Boy, I ain't camera ready.
You got me on the camera.

24:07.484 --> 24:08.485
New Orleans classic.

24:08.570 --> 24:10.488
-Big Shots. You know what I'm saying?
-Oh, my God. Yes.

24:10.571 --> 24:12.865
Check it. Come on, now. Come on with it.

24:12.948 --> 24:15.118
-Y'all didn't know--
-I'll drink it hot.

24:15.200 --> 24:19.371
It don't even have to be cold.
I'll drink it hot, I swear.

24:19.455 --> 24:21.625
So, yeah, like I was saying, it was...

24:22.875 --> 24:27.881
it was part of my depression,
where I was so lonesome and homesick,

24:29.007 --> 24:32.886
I stopped combing my hair,
like, literally.

24:33.637 --> 24:38.224
And it had got so thick and full, and,

24:38.892 --> 24:43.480
so, I said,
"Well, I don't know anybody up here."

24:43.563 --> 24:48.527
"I don't need to put all that maintenance
and stuff like that in my hair."

24:50.194 --> 24:53.907
Just kind of became a hermit in the house.
You know what I'm saying?

24:54.615 --> 24:58.912
I said, "Well,
I'mma just wear my hair natural."

24:58.994 --> 24:59.913
It looks good.

25:13.552 --> 25:15.469
When the storm actually hit,

25:15.846 --> 25:19.474
everybody I think was still
kind of asleep or just waking up.

25:20.016 --> 25:23.352
But all of a sudden,
we felt the house just...

25:24.729 --> 25:28.774
it almost sounded like a train.
It was shaking, wobbling, you know?

25:31.318 --> 25:34.196
My husband told me
to look out of the window.

25:34.280 --> 25:40.120
The water was at the window,
so we were surrounded by water.

25:40.202 --> 25:41.913
We were surrounded by water.

25:44.915 --> 25:48.503
When the water was rushing in,
I think the only thing I was thinking

25:48.586 --> 25:52.841
was, like, I was like in a...
mesmerized by, I guess,

25:52.924 --> 25:56.385
kind of by how it was like...
you know, that shit was like a movie.

25:57.012 --> 26:00.514
Like, it was rushing in,
and then we was trying to get on.

26:00.598 --> 26:01.640
We ran to the back.

26:01.725 --> 26:05.687
But literally, we sitting on the bed,
literally, and the water just like this,

26:05.769 --> 26:07.354
-as we're sitting on the bed.
-Damn.

26:07.439 --> 26:09.231
The people's dog and this dude
was floating.

26:09.316 --> 26:11.943
Their dog was dead,
just floating on the water.

26:12.026 --> 26:13.778
-Damn.
-Floating about around our house,

26:13.861 --> 26:14.779
or whatever.

26:17.281 --> 26:20.701
I think everybody was just trying
to find their mental comfort

26:20.785 --> 26:24.206
of how to handle what was going on.

26:24.288 --> 26:26.957
-Right.
-And, so I had said,

26:27.042 --> 26:28.543
"Well, okay. Let's sing."

26:29.293 --> 26:35.299
And that's what we did. We sung hymns.
We sung, you know, R&B.

26:35.383 --> 26:39.846
Like, we just formed our own little choir,
so we was just in there singing.

26:39.929 --> 26:43.475
And for two days
when the world was thinking

26:43.557 --> 26:49.271
that no one was left in New Orleans
or in Katrina, we were still in our attic.

26:50.648 --> 26:53.275
The boat pulled up into the living room...

26:54.986 --> 27:00.367
because the whole front of the house,
the water had collapsed it, or whatever.

27:01.117 --> 27:03.203
And we got out of there.

27:06.081 --> 27:08.416
There was really an eerie silence...

27:12.379 --> 27:16.966
and I think everybody
was so overwhelmed and taken by

27:17.050 --> 27:21.637
how the city,
their neighborhoods, was underwater.

27:22.721 --> 27:24.140
The water was so deep,

27:24.223 --> 27:27.351
you saw just that very little point
of the stop sign.

27:30.063 --> 27:33.024
It was just like a dead calm.

27:33.649 --> 27:37.820
You didn't even hear birds or anything.

27:38.989 --> 27:43.159
It's almost like what you read
in the Bible about the great flood,

27:43.242 --> 27:45.954
and it was just water.

27:46.037 --> 27:48.832
You're surrounded by water, you know?

27:48.915 --> 27:51.960
And you're looking for that dove

27:52.043 --> 27:57.381
to come back and say it's dry land,
but there was no bird in sight.

28:13.731 --> 28:16.859
And I looked back, and I saw

28:16.942 --> 28:20.613
that my house
was the only house still standing.

28:29.371 --> 28:30.874
Me personally, I thought we was gonna die.

28:30.956 --> 28:34.877
Like, you know,
the furniture is floating in here.

28:34.961 --> 28:37.504
Like, you know, if you look outside,
you don't see nothing.

28:37.589 --> 28:40.382
Like, we gonna die.
Like, we gonna die here.

28:40.467 --> 28:44.387
Like, that's just what it is, you know?
So, and we stranded.

28:44.471 --> 28:48.266
We wasn't here for one day,
or we wasn't in here for 12 hours.

28:48.350 --> 28:50.936
We was in here three days.
We were up here three days.

28:51.018 --> 28:55.815
Then we go from here,
we get rescued and go get shipped

28:55.899 --> 28:59.027
into a concentration camp structure.
Like, you know what I'm saying?

28:59.109 --> 29:00.653
Like, I'd never fight for this country.

29:00.736 --> 29:02.948
I don't depend on it.
I can't depend on it.

29:03.030 --> 29:06.200
Like, I'd never fight for it,
just on the strength of Hurricane Katrina.

29:06.284 --> 29:08.827
And I was 11 years old
when I made that decision.

29:18.255 --> 29:21.507
With the water,
it's like the water's there.

29:21.590 --> 29:25.177
And I go outside,
and I'm just like, "What?"

29:25.261 --> 29:29.848
I'm just looking around, like, "What?"
I hear a lot of screams.

29:30.809 --> 29:34.812
And the guy next door, he had a boat.

29:34.895 --> 29:38.482
I don't know where this boat came from,
but he had a boat, and he was like,

29:38.567 --> 29:42.361
"I'm bringing y'all to the bridge.
I'm bringing y'all to the bridge."

30:34.623 --> 30:36.208
We went to the convention center...

30:37.751 --> 30:41.755
and it was... it was weird.

30:46.508 --> 30:49.763
I saw a dead man on the street.
It was scary.

30:50.721 --> 30:55.184
Like, "What?" Like, "Am I gonna die?"
Like, I started questioning things now.

30:57.145 --> 31:01.983
I could just smell like... like feces,

31:02.067 --> 31:06.780
just lingering from the bathroom,
and just people just looked like,

31:08.031 --> 31:11.033
just sad, just real sad.

31:13.661 --> 31:16.164
I don't know. I just was like,
"I'm not supposed to be here."

31:16.247 --> 31:20.626
That's how I felt.
Like, "What? Like, this is not real."

31:43.483 --> 31:44.692
I don't want to cry.

31:48.196 --> 31:49.990
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

31:51.991 --> 31:53.118
Just take your time.

31:55.035 --> 31:57.162
It's okay. Like, wait. So, wait.

31:57.247 --> 31:59.540
So, have you ever
talked about this before?

32:01.001 --> 32:03.127
No, I haven't.

32:03.210 --> 32:04.253
Why, do you think?

32:05.422 --> 32:07.799
I don't know. Nobody never asked me.

32:16.850 --> 32:17.808
Can we take five?

32:23.981 --> 32:25.566
Hey, buddy, are you good?

32:25.649 --> 32:26.818
Hey, I'm tired, man.

32:33.867 --> 32:37.913
Hey, put me on here.
They got us living up in here, bad!

32:37.996 --> 32:41.833
They got babies up in here,
and it's unsanitized up in here!

32:41.917 --> 32:43.418
It is bad up in here!

32:43.502 --> 32:47.839
Children burning up and everything!
Get us out of this place!

32:47.923 --> 32:50.967
We had several people died out here,

32:51.051 --> 32:54.179
and, you know,
I don't want to become one of them.

32:54.971 --> 32:59.975
They say what they're gonna do,
but they're not doing anything for us

33:00.059 --> 33:02.187
to try to help us survive
and live, you know?

33:05.689 --> 33:09.401
We just need some help out here.
It is so pitiful.

33:09.486 --> 33:13.822
Pitiful and shame
that all these people out here,

33:13.907 --> 33:17.952
they have over 3,000 people out here
with no home, no shelter.

33:18.035 --> 33:18.994
What are they gonna do?

33:19.078 --> 33:20.829
I don't even think I honestly
thought twice about it.

33:20.913 --> 33:23.415
I saw a camera guy,
and I just walked up to them,

33:23.499 --> 33:25.084
and I basically just

33:25.168 --> 33:28.296
kind of pulled my face
really closely towards the camera,

33:28.379 --> 33:31.383
and I spoke eloquently. Like, I spoke.

33:32.217 --> 33:35.177
And I was basically, back then,
I was the voice for many people

33:35.262 --> 33:39.932
that couldn't actually,
couldn't or wouldn't speak for themselves.

33:40.016 --> 33:43.895
I felt that
there were certain circumstances

33:43.979 --> 33:47.189
that were totally unacceptable,
that were not cool.

33:48.190 --> 33:51.569
My grandmother had actually, literally,
ran out of her insulin,

33:51.652 --> 33:53.113
and my grandmother was a diabetic.

33:53.195 --> 33:55.115
But I didn't realize that,
that was something

33:55.198 --> 33:57.116
that she could go without.

33:57.200 --> 34:00.160
I felt as though during that time
that it was a necessity,

34:00.244 --> 34:01.872
that this was something that she needed.

34:01.955 --> 34:04.791
And during that time,
my grandmother was everything to me,

34:04.874 --> 34:07.878
and I was really afraid and petrified,

34:07.961 --> 34:12.549
and really afraid the most
that I would possibly lose her.

34:13.175 --> 34:15.510
My grandmother is a diabetic.
She's 76 years old.

34:15.593 --> 34:18.220
She's out of her insulin.
What's she gonna do?

34:18.305 --> 34:22.809
She don't know if she gonna live or die.
We all don't know what we gonna do.

34:22.892 --> 34:26.020
So, we just need some help and support.

34:46.665 --> 34:48.001
People lost their homes.

34:50.294 --> 34:54.090
People didn't have food, water.
It was hot as hell out there.

34:55.174 --> 34:57.135
People were doing what they had to do.

34:58.470 --> 35:01.932
I hate the way they portray us
in the media.

35:02.891 --> 35:05.810
If we see a Black family,
it says they're looting.

35:06.393 --> 35:08.939
We see a White family,
it says they're looking for food.

35:09.397 --> 35:13.943
The things that I witnessed today,
Ted, I will never forget.

35:14.026 --> 35:19.198
Looting on a scale that was just
so staggering, so overwhelming.

35:19.824 --> 35:22.034
The city has been ravaged
by the hurricane.

35:22.117 --> 35:24.579
And now, it's being ravaged
by some of its citizens.

35:24.662 --> 35:29.292
We want help! We want help! We want help!

35:33.837 --> 35:37.925
We can't make it.
You said if we need You, to call You.

35:38.008 --> 35:41.262
And we are asking You
in the mighty name of Jesus,

35:41.346 --> 35:43.056
there is none like You.

35:43.138 --> 35:48.728
And you know that it's been five days
because most of the people are Black,

35:48.812 --> 35:53.232
and the way America is set up
to help the poor, the Black people,

35:53.316 --> 35:56.402
the less well-off as slow as possible.

35:56.486 --> 36:01.615
Praise the Lord! Lord,
we know you're gonna make a way, Lord.

36:15.588 --> 36:17.424
Now, it belongs to God.

36:19.133 --> 36:20.051
It's just racist.

36:25.765 --> 36:27.934
George Bush doesn't care
about Black people.

36:57.796 --> 37:00.592
You don't know where you're going.
You don't know what's next.

37:02.302 --> 37:04.595
Kids were separated from their families.

37:04.678 --> 37:08.265
Families were separated,
just sent into random places.

37:12.436 --> 37:15.606
My cousins were displaced
because their home was destroyed.

37:18.776 --> 37:23.198
Hurricane Katrina caused
one of the biggest dispersements

37:23.280 --> 37:25.283
of Black people in history.

37:32.206 --> 37:34.084
You know, that shit happened
during slavery, and, like,

37:34.167 --> 37:35.710
it also happened in 2005.

37:43.510 --> 37:46.638
I remember sitting in a room with my mom

37:46.720 --> 37:50.642
and my dad in a motel and just wondering
when I was gonna go back home.

37:50.725 --> 37:54.228
And it turned into one week
to two weeks to three weeks to a month.

37:54.312 --> 37:57.983
And next thing you know,
I was living in Mississippi.

37:58.066 --> 37:59.693
I ended up going to Houston.

38:01.194 --> 38:02.696
We was in a hotel.

38:02.779 --> 38:04.488
We can't stay in this expensive-ass
hotel anymore,

38:04.572 --> 38:05.907
so what's gonna have to happen?

38:05.990 --> 38:07.826
Where are we gonna go?
We can't go back to the city.

38:07.909 --> 38:09.452
A lot of people, for Katrina,

38:09.536 --> 38:11.912
that was their first time ever
leaving New Orleans.

38:11.997 --> 38:13.206
Like, people never left.

38:13.289 --> 38:14.708
I was a senior in high school,

38:14.791 --> 38:18.127
and once we came to the realization
that we couldn't go back home,

38:18.210 --> 38:19.670
we moved to Dallas.

38:19.753 --> 38:25.260
We were there ultimately for a year
because we ended up just relocating,

38:25.342 --> 38:28.095
not really by choice,
but we didn't really have...

38:28.180 --> 38:29.890
like, we lost everything in Katrina.

38:29.972 --> 38:32.559
That was the first time
I ever got called a refugee.

38:33.684 --> 38:35.645
I'm from America. You know what I mean?

38:35.728 --> 38:39.064
I'm from this... this is my land,
but I'm being called a refugee.

38:39.149 --> 38:42.360
Kids at the schools would be like,
"He's a refugee. That's what they're..."

38:42.444 --> 38:46.196
"Yeah? What you loot? Did you loot?
Did you... did you loots?"

38:46.280 --> 38:48.782
The principal was like,
"Do you think you'll fit in here?"

38:48.866 --> 38:52.620
What kind of question is that to ask
a girl that just came from,

38:52.704 --> 38:55.122
you know, her house being
under eight feet of water?

38:55.206 --> 38:56.665
"Do you think you'll fit in here?"

38:56.749 --> 39:00.086
Hell the fuck no, I'm not gonna
fit in here. I don't want to fit in here.

39:00.170 --> 39:02.631
The tension has been slowly
escalating here.

39:02.714 --> 39:06.968
Fights have broken out in schools between
New Orleans evacuees and Houston students.

39:07.051 --> 39:10.931
And now, Houston police say
Katrina evacuees have been the victims

39:11.014 --> 39:14.601
or suspects in about
20 percent of the city's homicides.

39:14.684 --> 39:17.061
More than double their percentage
in the population.

39:18.687 --> 39:21.190
It was two weeks
after we had evacuated to Lafayette,

39:21.273 --> 39:24.569
and it was not easy to adjust
to this new place.

39:27.280 --> 39:28.698
I think that, like, you know...

39:30.408 --> 39:33.537
Like, I don't know. Like, we definitely
went to school too soon.

39:34.787 --> 39:37.541
I didn't retain anything
that they were teaching us.

39:38.166 --> 39:42.962
We stayed in Lafayette for about
eight months, and it felt like two years.

39:51.428 --> 39:54.640
The people in Lafayette knew we couldn't
go back to New Orleans,

39:54.724 --> 39:58.061
so they tried to make it
as easy as possible

39:58.143 --> 40:01.230
for us to make that transition
with the kids.

40:03.857 --> 40:08.446
As far as you're concerned,
when you started playing football

40:08.529 --> 40:12.409
and getting into activities in the school
that you was in,

40:12.492 --> 40:13.826
you were fine then.

40:13.909 --> 40:16.079
Matter of fact, you didn't even want
to leave there.

40:16.163 --> 40:19.665
The people that we were staying with
didn't want you to leave there.

40:19.749 --> 40:21.501
Your coach didn't want you to leave there.

40:21.584 --> 40:24.169
He wanted you to continue
playing ball there.

40:24.253 --> 40:26.173
So, that was good therapy for you.

40:26.255 --> 40:30.177
My kids, they came out of it
pretty good, I think.

40:31.635 --> 40:34.638
How do you think overall,
Hurricane Katrina impacted,

40:34.722 --> 40:37.266
like, you know,
the family or, like, the kids?

40:39.310 --> 40:41.061
How do I think they impacted?

40:44.858 --> 40:46.985
I really don't know
how it impacted the kids,

40:47.068 --> 40:49.361
cause the kids wasn't saying anything.

40:49.446 --> 40:51.573
They wasn't telling us nothing.

40:51.656 --> 40:55.534
So, it was like a normal, everyday life.

40:55.618 --> 40:59.705
So, that's how I looked at it, as normal,
everyday life. I mean...

40:59.788 --> 41:02.291
We actually... I used to constantly
ask you how you were doing

41:02.374 --> 41:06.921
and how Kiyara and them, how they doing,
and y'all just say, "We okay."

41:07.004 --> 41:10.300
And especially you, 'cause you used to go
in a room and lock up in a room,

41:10.383 --> 41:12.801
and I used to say,
"You all right, you all right?"

41:12.886 --> 41:15.597
But didn't seem like nothing
was wrong with you.

41:15.680 --> 41:17.599
If it was, you didn't say anything.

41:31.821 --> 41:35.367
It was a big day in New Orleans.
A month after Hurricane Katrina,

41:35.450 --> 41:39.079
officials began letting people
back into three large neighborhoods.

41:39.162 --> 41:40.622
It's been clear for some time

41:40.705 --> 41:42.498
that the city would never be the same,

41:42.581 --> 41:46.126
but just how it could change
is just now becoming clearer.

41:48.880 --> 41:53.134
New Orleans and the French Quarter
will continue on no matter what.

41:53.218 --> 41:54.594
I mean, it's gonna be a different city,

41:54.678 --> 41:56.805
but there's gonna be a lot of things
that ain't gonna change.

41:56.888 --> 41:59.181
And I think the things
that don't change will be...

41:59.265 --> 42:02.519
for the better, places like Cafe Du Monde
and Jackson Square. And...

42:03.227 --> 42:05.564
I mean, it's just a whole list
of institutions

42:05.647 --> 42:07.357
that have been here forever.

42:09.860 --> 42:12.320
The city was not ready
to receive all of us.

42:13.446 --> 42:15.906
But of course, they needed their workers
to come back,

42:15.991 --> 42:18.534
you know, to get that tourism industry
pumping again.

42:32.257 --> 42:33.925
This is Granny's house.

43:06.124 --> 43:10.502
Being honest with y'all,
I would rather the whole house...

43:11.880 --> 43:13.507
I don't know how it's gonna be...

43:21.223 --> 43:22.139
Oh, God.

43:25.894 --> 43:28.021
When did you get back to New Orleans?

43:28.605 --> 43:32.066
When did I get back to New Orleans?
As soon as they opened the state back up,

43:32.150 --> 43:33.193
my great-grandmother was like,

43:33.276 --> 43:36.028
"Okay, it's time to go home.
I want to go back to my house."

43:36.111 --> 43:37.112
You know what I mean?

43:37.196 --> 43:39.074
And so, we packed up,
and we went back home.

43:39.156 --> 43:40.824
-What did you see?
-Ghosts.

43:42.451 --> 43:45.538
Nobody around here,
it was just a ghost town.

43:45.621 --> 43:47.122
Debris everywhere.

43:47.207 --> 43:51.086
Dead animals. I actually came back and saw
my dog because I couldn't take him.

43:51.168 --> 43:54.964
You know what I mean?
It was just a whole lot of hurt.

43:55.048 --> 43:57.508
I seen people that was just hurting,
head down.

43:57.591 --> 43:58.927
Didn't know what they was gonna do.

43:59.009 --> 44:01.304
Didn't know if a better day
was gonna come.

44:01.388 --> 44:02.596
It was just gloom everywhere.

44:02.680 --> 44:04.181
And as far as I can remember,

44:04.265 --> 44:07.351
that's what it was every day
for a long time.

44:14.066 --> 44:15.317
I was ready to get back to school,

44:15.944 --> 44:18.488
so we ended up coming back
down to New Orleans.

44:19.114 --> 44:21.324
And I stayed in a FEMA trailer

44:21.407 --> 44:25.244
that I later found out was filled
with formaldehyde.

44:26.161 --> 44:27.204
Okay, so...

44:31.251 --> 44:34.920
Yeah, basically, because they were...
they were cheap.

44:35.004 --> 44:39.800
So, they bought all these trailers
that were actually not in use

44:39.885 --> 44:42.679
because they were filled
with formaldehyde.

44:43.513 --> 44:46.141
It's another blow for victims
of Hurricane Katrina.

44:46.224 --> 44:49.226
Tests found toxic levels
of formaldehyde fumes.

44:49.311 --> 44:52.354
More than 500 trailers
in Louisiana and Mississippi,

44:52.439 --> 44:56.400
some had 40 times the fumes
found in most modern homes.

44:56.483 --> 44:58.236
Two years later,

44:58.320 --> 45:01.697
when I would actually lay on my back,
I would notice

45:01.781 --> 45:05.452
a ball sticking out of my stomach
that just came from nowhere.

45:06.119 --> 45:09.122
So, I kind of ignored it for a while

45:09.206 --> 45:12.250
until I started having,
like, all kind of issues, health issues.

45:12.334 --> 45:15.378
So, then I went to the doctor to find out

45:15.462 --> 45:19.924
that it was a tumor that had grown
because of staying in the trailer.

45:25.137 --> 45:27.516
You could smell death.

45:27.598 --> 45:29.683
You had bodies laying on the side
of the road still,

45:29.767 --> 45:33.520
lifting-up trees, and dead dogs,
and dead birds underneath,

45:33.605 --> 45:35.981
maggots everywhere,
all type in the garbage everywhere.

45:36.065 --> 45:39.319
So, you know, it was just a smell
that I'll never forget.

45:40.028 --> 45:42.072
My people went to go check on the house,

45:42.155 --> 45:45.116
and I still just remember being,
like, giddy, like,

45:45.200 --> 45:49.746
"Cool. My toy that I left on my dresser,
they bringing all of that," type of thing.

45:49.830 --> 45:53.458
And I just remember, like,
when they got out the car,

45:53.542 --> 45:57.671
and it was just a trash bag
that wasn't even filled,

45:57.754 --> 45:59.922
and it was like,
"This is it from the whole house."

46:00.005 --> 46:01.590
I'm thinking that's just my room.

46:01.674 --> 46:06.220
So, that I think was the first time
it actually hit of, like...

46:07.805 --> 46:10.474
what we knew to be true is gone.

46:14.896 --> 46:17.314
This is what it means when they say
nobody asked you.

46:17.399 --> 46:19.733
'Cause it's the first time
I said that out loud.

46:24.488 --> 46:28.326
Everything you consider
as part of who you are

46:28.410 --> 46:30.620
was reduced to a trash bag, you know?

46:32.539 --> 46:37.126
But the magnitude of that just became
so much worse when you start to realize,

46:37.210 --> 46:39.421
"Oh, not just the house.
The whole neighborhood."

46:39.504 --> 46:42.048
Like, "Ms. So-and-So
doesn't live here anymore."

46:42.131 --> 46:44.593
Or when you start to really see

46:44.676 --> 46:48.095
the loss of life,
that's on a completely different level.

46:48.180 --> 46:52.725
And when so much of your identity
is where you're from,

46:52.809 --> 46:54.561
specifically what neighborhood
you're from,

46:54.643 --> 46:56.228
and that neighborhood
isn't the same anymore,

46:56.312 --> 47:00.524
that house isn't there anymore,
what does that do to your identity?

47:00.608 --> 47:02.360
Like, sometimes, after the storm,

47:02.444 --> 47:05.738
I'd just go back to my old neighborhood
and just sit on a porch.

47:07.239 --> 47:09.034
Like, the house was all boarded up
and stuff,

47:09.117 --> 47:11.368
but I still just wanted to be there,
you know?

47:11.452 --> 47:14.079
Like, I'd just sit there for hours,
you know?

47:36.228 --> 47:39.688
My parents had finally decided
that it was time to go back home...

47:41.273 --> 47:42.816
so we got on the road.

47:48.948 --> 47:52.201
This is the shed,
everything that was in it,

47:52.285 --> 47:54.662
the bicycles and...

47:54.745 --> 47:59.084
Although my house was still standing,
the New Orleans that we knew was gone.

48:00.000 --> 48:01.544
Boy, what a thing to lose.

48:23.274 --> 48:29.071
Before Katrina, I remember everybody
in the neighborhood, all of us together.

48:29.154 --> 48:32.033
Your neighborhood was crucial
to who you were.

48:32.117 --> 48:34.578
At the least, you had your family.

48:35.078 --> 48:37.413
You had your community.
You had your people, so to speak.

48:37.496 --> 48:40.208
Everybody on the block
watched out for my kids.

48:40.292 --> 48:42.042
We watched out for each other's kids.

48:42.585 --> 48:44.753
Before Katrina, like, you had no reason
to leave your hood

48:44.837 --> 48:46.922
because your hood had everything in it.

48:47.007 --> 48:51.093
Kids was outside, playing in the street.
You know, it was amazing.

48:51.178 --> 48:54.472
Like, thinking about it,
it really was African in the essence.

48:54.555 --> 48:55.639
It was just Black people.

48:55.723 --> 48:58.392
That's all you saw,
and that's all you really thought about.

48:58.476 --> 48:59.728
It was really the Big Easy.

48:59.810 --> 49:03.522
Like, generation after generation,
we lived the same way.

49:04.106 --> 49:05.483
Nothing ever changed.

49:08.069 --> 49:08.945
But after Katrina...

49:11.656 --> 49:16.160
The displacing of Black communities
all over the city

49:16.244 --> 49:20.081
started to cause, like,
this trickle-down effect of, you know,

49:20.164 --> 49:23.543
you are no longer in the community
you came up in.

49:24.211 --> 49:29.131
You are now being put in, like,
concentrated areas or, like,

49:29.216 --> 49:33.470
pockets to where people
that are territorial

49:33.553 --> 49:37.265
and are super, you know,
hard up about where they're from

49:37.348 --> 49:40.601
now being placed
in certain parts of the city

49:40.685 --> 49:43.270
because they were displaced
or they lost their homes.

49:43.355 --> 49:46.149
And, you know, now,
the rent for the whole street

49:46.232 --> 49:48.984
has gone up and new people have moved in.

49:49.069 --> 49:54.866
Think about what that does to a community.
It destabilizes it.

50:01.122 --> 50:04.167
Q93, WQUE-FM New Orleans.

50:04.251 --> 50:06.336
- Less talk, more jams.
- Yeah!

50:06.419 --> 50:07.838
- Q93.
- Number one...

50:07.921 --> 50:10.465
I just remember going, like, back.

50:14.219 --> 50:19.098
And they had the weird houses.
I thought it was so weird.

50:19.765 --> 50:21.977
And they had, like, solar panels on them,

50:22.060 --> 50:25.188
and I did not know
what that was at that time.

50:27.148 --> 50:29.483
I just feel like they're trying
to make it into, like,

50:29.567 --> 50:31.735
a new community full of White people.

50:34.655 --> 50:36.616
We see all these White people
coming out of houses

50:36.700 --> 50:39.202
across the street from the projects,
and we're just looking like,

50:39.286 --> 50:40.911
"What is going on, you know?"

50:40.995 --> 50:43.957
The White people and stuff taking over
'cause the rent getting high and stuff,

50:44.039 --> 50:46.876
so the neighborhoods
is totally different now.

50:46.960 --> 50:51.173
I think gentrification was happening
before the storm, but Katrina sped it up.

50:58.220 --> 51:01.016
The feel of community
in New Orleans is different now,

51:01.891 --> 51:04.269
'cause people are moving around so much,
you know?

51:04.352 --> 51:07.272
Like I was saying, you can live
in the Eighth Ward one year,

51:07.355 --> 51:09.732
then move uptown
to the 13th the next year.

51:09.815 --> 51:12.485
And, so, you don't really get to know
nobody. You might speak to your neighbor,

51:12.569 --> 51:14.237
but it's not like it used to be.

51:14.320 --> 51:15.321
You're not rooted.

51:15.404 --> 51:19.074
The children aren't as rooted as they used
to be before the storm, you know?

51:28.417 --> 51:30.420
When I got back after Katrina,

51:30.502 --> 51:33.381
I naively thought that everything
was gonna be normal again.

51:38.637 --> 51:44.099
But in actuality, with my cousins
not being able to come back...

51:46.394 --> 51:48.146
I felt alone and bored.

51:54.152 --> 51:56.488
I would just roam around New Orleans,
going to places

51:56.570 --> 51:59.449
that my parents had sheltered me
from as a child.

52:02.326 --> 52:06.455
My mama disliked a lot of the neighborhood
kids that I started to hang out with.

52:09.459 --> 52:11.920
But then I met this one kid, Jacquez.

52:14.421 --> 52:15.757
We called him Jac for short.

52:17.092 --> 52:21.220
I remember one day, me and this other kid
were gonna fight at the bus stop.

52:22.013 --> 52:24.348
I guarantee you
that it was for no good reason.

52:25.475 --> 52:27.810
And right when we were about
to go at it,

52:29.395 --> 52:34.317
Jacquez, simply 'cause I was from his hood
and he knew my parents...

52:36.235 --> 52:39.822
stepped right in front of me,
and he defused the whole situation.

52:48.747 --> 52:51.126
Afterwards, he became like a big bro.

52:54.044 --> 52:58.549
He was one of the only kids I ever heard
talk about the future or going to college.

53:12.480 --> 53:15.399
My mama always had
this Hi8 camera in the house,

53:15.774 --> 53:19.028
so I picked that up one day and started
filming things in my neighborhood.

53:21.614 --> 53:23.782
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

53:27.579 --> 53:28.580
That shit's crazy.

53:30.665 --> 53:33.042
That be nice. That be just icy.

53:33.960 --> 53:35.378
Yes, sir, what's happening with it?

53:41.051 --> 53:43.594
- What is it?
- Crawfish, crabs, and shrimp.

53:43.678 --> 53:47.807
Jac always made me feel like I could do
anything I put my heart into.

53:49.976 --> 53:54.480
When I graduated college,
Jacquez was so proud.

53:54.563 --> 53:55.564
Which is...

53:58.985 --> 54:04.782
Look, everyone's just graduated.
Wayne, Tom, Clack, all the family. Shaq.

54:04.865 --> 54:07.534
He and Tom bought a leotard one time.

54:07.619 --> 54:08.535
And Jac!

54:13.458 --> 54:16.877
The violence in New Orleans
still touched everything.

54:18.046 --> 54:22.425
You had people from different
neighborhoods just all combined together,

54:22.508 --> 54:24.802
which means that you got
new people back there

54:24.886 --> 54:28.139
trying to make a name for themself,
trying to claim territory,

54:28.222 --> 54:31.350
but then you got the people
that already had that territory, like,

54:31.433 --> 54:33.353
"Nah, bro. This is my shit."

54:33.435 --> 54:35.438
So, it was just, like, a lot of gunplay.

54:35.521 --> 54:38.024
It was, like, a lot of gun violence,
a lot of fights.

54:38.108 --> 54:40.485
Little kids, they want to be killers
when they grow up.

54:40.569 --> 54:42.571
Like, they see their little partners
with a gun, "Oh, yeah."

54:42.654 --> 54:45.907
Like, little kids now,
they really just want to be real.

54:45.990 --> 54:48.827
Like, that's what it really is.
Like, they want to be gangster.

54:48.910 --> 54:51.121
They ain't really like,
"Oh, I want to be this when I grow up."

54:51.203 --> 54:53.914
It's really like,
"Oh, yeah. I'm about that life, yeah."

54:53.998 --> 54:56.417
"Let me put on my Dickie fit.
Yeah, I'm hood now."

54:56.500 --> 54:58.253
But now, after the storm, it's like...

54:59.254 --> 55:02.131
you don't even have to be living
that life in that world.

55:02.214 --> 55:04.842
You don't have to be living
in the "hood," per se.

55:04.925 --> 55:07.970
But you could be affected by violence
in New Orleans, 'cause it's so scattered.

55:08.053 --> 55:09.513
It's so random, you know?

55:09.597 --> 55:12.392
It could pop off
at any time of the day, anywhere.

55:53.683 --> 55:56.144
Deputies were called
to the corner of Whitney Avenue

55:56.770 --> 55:58.938
and Landry Street around noon yesterday.

55:59.021 --> 56:03.610
There they found 23-year-old Jacquez Young
dead inside of a car.

56:04.069 --> 56:06.779
Another 20-year-old man
was taken to the hospital.

56:06.862 --> 56:09.824
Both of them had been shot several times.

56:09.907 --> 56:12.534
Witnesses told investigators they saw
several people

56:12.618 --> 56:17.582
inside of a white, four-door F-150 pull up
to the car and open fire.

56:25.589 --> 56:29.052
And that fucked me up, like, bad.
Really, really bad.

56:32.055 --> 56:33.013
Like...

56:39.855 --> 56:41.982
Yeah, I don't know. I think that...

56:44.942 --> 56:47.737
You know, like, where I'm from, we know.

56:47.821 --> 56:51.324
Like, we know that somebody
isn't gonna grow old with us.

56:51.408 --> 56:55.953
We know that somebody
is gonna either be a victim of, you know,

56:56.037 --> 56:59.207
the mass-incarceration system or violence,

57:00.165 --> 57:03.294
you know, or drugs. We know it.

57:04.253 --> 57:09.134
But I didn't think
that it would be Jacquez, you know?

57:12.553 --> 57:17.100
It was just like, "Man, if that can happen
to Jacquez, that shit can happen to me,"

57:17.182 --> 57:18.560
you know? And, like,

57:19.477 --> 57:22.479
I was sad, but I was more pissed
than anything

57:22.563 --> 57:25.065
that we had, like,
allowed that to happen to him.

57:25.149 --> 57:27.735
And, like, when I say we, I mean, like,
my neighborhood.

57:27.819 --> 57:32.032
I mean, like, you know, society,
like, America. It's just like...

57:32.115 --> 57:34.992
It just, like, really pissed me off
and made me angry, you know?

57:36.035 --> 57:38.455
Like, these are the conditions
that we live in.

57:38.537 --> 57:44.085
And, like, we live under conditions
where somebody as good as Jac,

57:45.253 --> 57:47.672
you know, can be shot dead in the street.

58:04.981 --> 58:06.399
Buckles!

58:07.816 --> 58:09.528
-What's up, Buckles?
-Hey, Snapchat!

58:09.611 --> 58:11.321
-It's not Snapchat here.
-Buckles!

58:12.906 --> 58:16.242
You look tired behind the camera, dawg.
Put the camera on y'all.

58:16.326 --> 58:20.038
Let me see it? I'm gonna put the camera
on y'all because y'all look tired, son.

58:20.121 --> 58:22.290
Three months after Jacquez passed...

58:24.500 --> 58:27.127
I was offered a job
as a high school media teacher.

58:27.211 --> 58:28.380
What's up, students?

58:30.673 --> 58:33.760
Being around those kids was therapeutic.

58:33.842 --> 58:37.137
They were so energetic,
and I just saw so much hope in them.

58:37.222 --> 58:38.431
Intro videos, take one.

58:40.057 --> 58:42.309
Wait, wait, wait. You look good!

58:42.394 --> 58:43.269
Not yet.

58:45.647 --> 58:49.150
As soon as they started filming
each other, they went deep real fast.

58:49.234 --> 58:50.360
Let's do a session.

58:50.443 --> 58:51.903
Quiet on the set.

58:51.987 --> 58:54.238
What's the worst thing
you experienced in life?

58:57.576 --> 59:00.620
I guess... I don't know.

59:00.704 --> 59:04.665
I guess, it was, like, Katrina.
I guess that would be the worst, I guess.

59:04.748 --> 59:07.043
I was scared a little 'cause, like,

59:07.127 --> 59:08.919
I didn't know
if we was gonna make it or not.

59:09.461 --> 59:13.341
I get nervous and scared and paranoid.

59:17.261 --> 59:21.765
All right. Now it is rolling.
Who's that, now? Tell me when.

59:24.393 --> 59:27.898
It was so clear that these students
were dealing with a lot,

59:27.981 --> 59:30.232
especially outside of school.

59:30.316 --> 59:32.068
World Issue, Calvin, take one.

59:33.695 --> 59:34.778
Action.

59:34.862 --> 59:38.742
Hi. My name's Calvin Baxter,
and I attend Edna Karr High School.

59:45.499 --> 59:46.583
Take me back to that night.

59:46.666 --> 59:49.836
Like, you know, what was going on?
What was happening?

59:50.628 --> 59:54.298
I went to the store.
I had bought me some gauze.

59:54.382 --> 59:58.302
And I'm walking out.
I'm on the avenue, and, fuck,

59:58.385 --> 1:00:02.598
a cop, he acts funny,
just started shooting at me.

1:00:02.682 --> 1:00:06.602
You see my heart right here, you know,
in that area right there.

1:00:06.685 --> 1:00:10.690
That's about three inches away, you know?
I could have got hit in the heart.

1:00:12.900 --> 1:00:16.654
And, fuck, I had... I had made it
to the hospital on my own.

1:00:17.738 --> 1:00:19.032
How many times they shot?

1:00:19.114 --> 1:00:21.367
They shot at me about 17 times.

1:00:21.451 --> 1:00:23.994
And they hit you how many times?

1:00:24.079 --> 1:00:26.080
-One time.
-You blessed.

1:00:26.164 --> 1:00:28.165
Oh, yeah. It made me carry a gun

1:00:28.250 --> 1:00:31.794
because I feel like
I've got to protect myself.

1:00:31.878 --> 1:00:34.464
Like, I'm... Shit, I don't know
when something gonna happen,

1:00:34.548 --> 1:00:36.216
so I got to keep it on me.

1:00:36.298 --> 1:00:40.678
-Even at 15?
-Even at 15. It don't matter.

1:00:42.096 --> 1:00:43.890
All the shit you've been through,

1:00:44.640 --> 1:00:47.351
like, you numb to the pain.
Really, like, it's numb to you.

1:00:47.434 --> 1:00:50.396
Like, you're so used to it happening,
you're like, "Fuck it."

1:00:50.479 --> 1:00:54.442
You're numb to the feeling.
You're coldhearted. You don't give a fuck.

1:00:54.526 --> 1:00:56.361
What does that do to a kid?

1:00:56.444 --> 1:01:00.823
That make them traumatized.
Like, coldhearted.

1:01:01.658 --> 1:01:06.078
I feel like everything changed
after Katrina.

1:01:06.161 --> 1:01:08.163
Like, you know,
they had to rebuild everything.

1:01:08.247 --> 1:01:10.791
And a lot of buildings, like, you know,

1:01:10.875 --> 1:01:13.878
they had a lot of youth centers
before Katrina and all that.

1:01:13.961 --> 1:01:16.005
They don't got a lot of them now.

1:01:16.088 --> 1:01:18.173
Okay, and what does that mean?

1:01:18.258 --> 1:01:21.302
A lot of children, they don't really
got no guidance out here.

1:01:21.386 --> 1:01:25.931
They don't got no place where they can go
after school to keep their mind occupied.

1:01:26.015 --> 1:01:29.436
The high school dropout rate,
the jail rate increasing.

1:01:30.102 --> 1:01:33.856
They just built a whole new jail.
Kids gangbanging it.

1:01:33.940 --> 1:01:36.693
Man, I seen a nine-year-old
smoking weed. Like...

1:01:38.236 --> 1:01:42.531
They need more jobs,
more youth programs, more mentors,

1:01:42.615 --> 1:01:45.200
more counseling, more guidance period.

1:01:47.704 --> 1:01:48.705
Cut.

1:01:55.127 --> 1:01:56.046
Okay.

1:01:59.798 --> 1:02:02.927
-You know, what is--
- Calling Officer Blaine, come in, please.

1:02:08.641 --> 1:02:11.310
-Go ahead.
- Come outside the back.

1:02:12.269 --> 1:02:14.689
-There's something going on.
-Let's cut, let's cut.

1:02:18.276 --> 1:02:19.819
Come on, Rodney. Let's go, let's go.

1:02:23.949 --> 1:02:26.660
I just went and stopped them two
just fighting out here.

1:02:26.743 --> 1:02:29.246
No! Move! Leave me the fuck alone! Move!

1:02:29.329 --> 1:02:30.872
-Come over here.
-No! Leave me alone!

1:02:30.956 --> 1:02:34.667
I didn't recognize my trauma and my peers'
trauma when I was in school.

1:02:34.750 --> 1:02:37.878
When I saw it as a teacher,
it was obvious that these kids

1:02:37.962 --> 1:02:40.298
are experiencing
some of the same things that me

1:02:40.381 --> 1:02:42.801
and my peers experienced
when we were in school.

1:02:46.513 --> 1:02:49.599
These kids' realities
was only getting worse,

1:02:50.267 --> 1:02:53.311
and it blew my mind that nothing
was in place to help them.

1:02:58.525 --> 1:03:01.860
Carol Carter, Katrina Babies, take one.

1:03:01.944 --> 1:03:03.946
We always have the perspective,

1:03:04.614 --> 1:03:08.910
which is very annoying to me,
is that somehow,

1:03:08.994 --> 1:03:10.661
we need to fix the children.

1:03:12.288 --> 1:03:17.501
We don't need to fix the children.
There is nothing wrong with the children.

1:03:18.920 --> 1:03:22.966
How do you make someone feel safe?
To feel safe is fundamental.

1:03:24.174 --> 1:03:27.137
They're in home environments
where they don't feel safe.

1:03:27.762 --> 1:03:30.472
They go to school,
and they don't feel safe.

1:03:31.975 --> 1:03:33.977
What does that do to our children?

1:03:34.060 --> 1:03:39.356
It wreaks havoc on their mental health,
their physical health, their well-being.

1:03:39.440 --> 1:03:41.025
And, so, they're, you know,

1:03:41.109 --> 1:03:44.321
how do you learn
when you're in trauma state,

1:03:44.404 --> 1:03:46.238
when you're in fight-and-flight state?

1:03:46.323 --> 1:03:49.034
Your body is producing all of these
chemicals constantly.

1:03:49.117 --> 1:03:50.493
That's your stasis mode.

1:03:50.577 --> 1:03:55.749
Your homeostasis is that trauma,
is that fight-or-flight mode.

1:03:56.791 --> 1:04:00.753
Your limbic system is there,

1:04:00.836 --> 1:04:04.299
which is what causes diabetes,
which causes heart disease,

1:04:04.381 --> 1:04:06.384
which causes high blood pressure
and kidney failure,

1:04:06.467 --> 1:04:10.931
and all kinds of other issues
that our children are dealing with.

1:04:11.014 --> 1:04:14.601
And, so, when we talk about
their behavior,

1:04:15.519 --> 1:04:19.314
their behavior is attributed
to that state.

1:04:22.066 --> 1:04:27.155
Anybody in that state for as long
as our children have been in that state

1:04:28.364 --> 1:04:31.284
would be angry,
would have behavioral problems,

1:04:31.368 --> 1:04:36.121
would be responding exactly the same way
that they are responding.

1:04:36.205 --> 1:04:37.666
They're not different.

1:04:37.748 --> 1:04:41.795
There's not something wrong with them.
They're doing what their bodies

1:04:42.545 --> 1:04:46.674
are telling them to do because that's what
trauma does to people.

1:04:54.266 --> 1:04:55.308
I feel like that.

1:04:58.895 --> 1:05:02.273
That's... Like, I can't never really
put it into words,

1:05:02.356 --> 1:05:05.235
but like, that's exactly how I feel.

1:05:13.826 --> 1:05:16.328
This is my fourth period.
They're doing it, you know, right now.

1:05:16.412 --> 1:05:18.748
This is Kwani. Say hey, Kwani.

1:05:18.832 --> 1:05:20.124
-Hey.
-Hey.

1:05:21.209 --> 1:05:23.879
This is my class. This is Kayla.

1:05:23.962 --> 1:05:27.381
Everybody's doing their work.
Kayla, what are you doing?

1:05:27.465 --> 1:05:30.093
In order just to get through my days,

1:05:30.177 --> 1:05:35.515
I've been pushing that stuff down,
though, you know?

1:05:40.394 --> 1:05:42.147
And it's taken, you know,

1:05:42.230 --> 1:05:45.482
seeing my students deal with this
for me to even realize it .

1:05:48.611 --> 1:05:52.823
When I look at them
and what they're up against...

1:05:55.492 --> 1:05:56.786
it just breaks my heart.

1:06:02.083 --> 1:06:05.754
My name is Shantrell Parker, and I'm 16,

1:06:05.836 --> 1:06:08.798
and I'm from the Fischer Projects.

1:06:14.012 --> 1:06:18.266
Barely out of their teens,
the family of 20-year-old Shantrell Parker

1:06:18.349 --> 1:06:20.227
and 20-year-old Gavonte Lampkin

1:06:20.310 --> 1:06:22.395
are trying to come to terms
with their deaths,

1:06:22.478 --> 1:06:27.484
both of them shot and killed, their bodies
burned beyond recognition in Algiers.

1:06:29.485 --> 1:06:31.487
So, I'm still thinking
it was a dream, like,

1:06:31.570 --> 1:06:33.240
we're gonna wake up from it or something.

1:06:33.323 --> 1:06:37.159
Kewone Carto says she grew up
with 18-year-old Shantrell Parker,

1:06:37.243 --> 1:06:41.872
who was killed alongside 20-year-old
Gavonte Lampkin July 29.

1:06:41.956 --> 1:06:44.835
She says Lampkin
was the father of Parker's two children.

1:06:45.752 --> 1:06:48.170
What is it like being an only child?

1:06:48.254 --> 1:06:52.050
What it's like being an only child
is I get anything I want,

1:06:52.133 --> 1:06:54.719
and I sleep peacefully.

1:06:54.802 --> 1:06:57.555
I want to go to school
to major in counseling.

1:06:57.638 --> 1:07:00.934
Why do you want to go
to school to be a counselor?

1:07:02.101 --> 1:07:05.813
I want to go to school to be a counselor
because I want to help people

1:07:05.896 --> 1:07:08.399
'cause I have been through
a lot in my life,

1:07:08.482 --> 1:07:11.193
and I know what it feels like to not have,

1:07:11.278 --> 1:07:15.615
and I know what it feels like to feel
that no one is here for you.

1:07:15.698 --> 1:07:18.535
What does it feel like
to have no one here for you?

1:07:19.160 --> 1:07:23.748
It feels like you want, like,
no one's here for you.

1:07:23.832 --> 1:07:27.419
Like, it's no love.
Like, nobody don't love you,

1:07:27.502 --> 1:07:31.173
and you always need that extra shoulder
to lean on when you're down.

1:07:37.888 --> 1:07:38.847
Yeah.

1:07:40.848 --> 1:07:45.103
Like, the anxiety in New Orleans

1:07:45.687 --> 1:07:48.564
of just simply walking to your car,

1:07:49.732 --> 1:07:53.319
you know, the anxiety in New Orleans
of just simply riding in a car,

1:07:54.236 --> 1:07:59.116
just sleeping by a window or, like,
you know, just existing, just living...

1:08:00.659 --> 1:08:04.747
you know? That shit is...
That shit will drive you crazy.

1:08:04.830 --> 1:08:06.957
And then, you know,
I go other places, and like,

1:08:07.042 --> 1:08:08.918
I feel totally free of that, you know?

1:08:10.085 --> 1:08:12.671
And I love my city,
but I'm just saying that, like,

1:08:14.048 --> 1:08:18.178
my anxiety is at the highest
when I'm home.

1:08:33.025 --> 1:08:36.028
There's nothing that calms me
like being around my family.

1:08:37.571 --> 1:08:39.324
The destination is on your right.

1:08:39.407 --> 1:08:42.826
Tina told me that she missed everyone
on my last trip there.

1:08:42.910 --> 1:08:43.911
Arrived.

1:08:45.371 --> 1:08:46.372
We're back.

1:08:46.455 --> 1:08:49.876
So, I decided to gather all of my cousins
together for a reunion.

1:08:50.543 --> 1:08:51.461
Hey.

1:08:56.924 --> 1:08:58.050
What's up, little one?

1:08:58.718 --> 1:09:00.135
We got everybody with us.

1:09:04.474 --> 1:09:05.475
Yeah.

1:09:07.727 --> 1:09:09.395
I figure we could use that.

1:09:13.482 --> 1:09:14.818
Tina gonna be happy to see everybody.

1:09:14.901 --> 1:09:16.403
-I know.
-Erica.

1:09:18.113 --> 1:09:19.905
So, what's everybody name?

1:09:21.365 --> 1:09:24.244
-I never met...
-She said, "What's everybody name?"

1:09:26.329 --> 1:09:29.123
-RyRy, Kai.
-All right. Kai.

1:09:31.501 --> 1:09:32.793
What's up, bro?

1:09:34.212 --> 1:09:35.087
What's up?

1:09:39.133 --> 1:09:40.217
What's up?

1:09:42.554 --> 1:09:44.681
Come on, boy. This party getting big.

1:10:37.524 --> 1:10:39.151
I think it's hard to talk about Katrina,

1:10:39.610 --> 1:10:43.657
because it takes having
some form of vulnerability.

1:10:46.951 --> 1:10:47.993
You know,

1:10:48.410 --> 1:10:53.082
acknowledging that something
happened to you and that it wasn't okay.

1:10:59.256 --> 1:11:02.967
If you're not able to be vulnerable,
how do you heal?

1:11:08.473 --> 1:11:10.933
It's decades after Katrina hit.

1:11:12.226 --> 1:11:14.395
So much becomes built up

1:11:14.479 --> 1:11:17.356
in those decades
where it was not talked about.

1:11:21.152 --> 1:11:23.696
Being able to tell my Katrina story

1:11:23.779 --> 1:11:27.533
has been, you know,
part of my healing process,

1:11:27.616 --> 1:11:31.413
healing something that you didn't even
know needed to be healed to begin with.

1:11:36.959 --> 1:11:39.169
New Orleans is an African city.

1:11:40.337 --> 1:11:43.800
We're oral people, sitting around a fire,

1:11:44.592 --> 1:11:47.636
telling stories passed down
through generations.

1:11:55.604 --> 1:11:56.896
It's been therapeutic.

1:11:59.733 --> 1:12:01.610
Katrina is becoming a folktale...

1:12:04.863 --> 1:12:06.363
and we're the storytellers.

1:12:10.492 --> 1:12:11.912
Telling my story,

1:12:12.578 --> 1:12:16.874
it inspired, you know, a lot of others
that's going through the same thing.

1:12:16.957 --> 1:12:20.711
It makes them just want to speak up more
'cause they know they're not by themself.

1:12:22.129 --> 1:12:25.842
I feel like nobody should be that young
going through shit like that.

1:12:30.179 --> 1:12:33.307
Really, I want...
I'm trying to change myself.

1:12:36.228 --> 1:12:39.855
I want better in life than this.
I want to raise a family.

1:12:41.774 --> 1:12:43.025
When I look at the videos...

1:12:43.109 --> 1:12:44.569
Oh, no, man.

1:12:53.662 --> 1:12:57.833
You gonna get through it,
but you have to have faith that you would.

1:12:59.291 --> 1:13:03.504
My journey right now is really
to be the best that I can be.

1:13:05.090 --> 1:13:06.632
I want to learn new things,

1:13:07.800 --> 1:13:10.554
and that just, like,
drives me to keep going.

1:13:12.347 --> 1:13:17.727
I got things that I want to accomplish,
got places I want to go.

1:13:17.811 --> 1:13:23.440
I'm older now, and look at me.
I made it. I made it out.

1:13:33.368 --> 1:13:36.705
Every time they give me
a new health diagnosis,

1:13:36.787 --> 1:13:39.457
like diabetes formed after,

1:13:39.541 --> 1:13:42.669
like, all these different things,
and I try not to think about it.

1:13:42.752 --> 1:13:49.217
But it's like how would my life be now
if I'd never stayed in that trailer?

1:13:51.635 --> 1:13:54.431
I really don't tell my story

1:13:54.513 --> 1:13:57.392
because I don't want you
to feel sorry for me.

1:13:57.475 --> 1:14:01.228
I never wanted to be
the so-called cancer patient.

1:14:01.313 --> 1:14:03.105
Like, I want you to look at me,

1:14:03.188 --> 1:14:05.859
and I want you to see
the person that I am,

1:14:05.942 --> 1:14:09.236
the person that I was
before I even got sick.

1:14:09.320 --> 1:14:11.114
Like, I just want to be me.

1:14:41.602 --> 1:14:43.771
When everything around you is set up

1:14:43.854 --> 1:14:47.400
in a way that it's not meant
for you to survive,

1:14:47.484 --> 1:14:52.154
resilience is when you still find a way
to have your head up and help yourself.

1:14:55.199 --> 1:14:58.535
But sometimes I feel like resilience
is used as a tool

1:14:58.620 --> 1:15:02.040
because they want people to think,
"Oh, no. Everything is okay."

1:15:02.123 --> 1:15:03.875
"These people are good,
they're strong."

1:15:03.959 --> 1:15:05.876
"Look at how much they've overcome."

1:15:09.297 --> 1:15:12.716
So, like, I feel like it's for me
to say when I'm resilient.

1:15:12.800 --> 1:15:15.679
It's for me to say what is resilient.
It's not for you.

1:15:39.619 --> 1:15:43.790
You know, it's the whole idea of saying
that New Orleans is rebuilt.

1:15:45.040 --> 1:15:46.001
It's not.

1:15:55.427 --> 1:15:59.763
Even though we are resilient,
we can never get back what was lost.

1:17:57.923 --> 1:17:59.342
-Y'all had fun?
-Yeah.

1:17:59.426 --> 1:18:01.344
Excuse me, but I'm too hot for TV.

1:18:01.428 --> 1:18:02.637
Okay, baby.
