WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:02.791
Previously on Teen Wolf...

00:02.962 --> 00:03.951
Where's the She-Wolf?

00:04.130 --> 00:07.247
La lglesia. The church was built
over the ruins of an Aztec temple.

00:07.467 --> 00:08.627
If it's being used
to disseminate the list,

00:08.843 --> 00:10.708
then it's probably gonna keep
going until everyone's dead.

00:13.306 --> 00:14.466
You wanna bail on the plan.

00:56.682 --> 00:59.139
Hey! Hey, relax!
I'm going to open the bag.

00:59.352 --> 01:01.434
Hey, do you hear me?
I'm going to open the bag.

01:09.612 --> 01:11.022
It's Kalissa, right?

01:19.455 --> 01:22.197
I guess you're coming
to a certain conclusion.

01:23.459 --> 01:25.871
You're not going to be leaving here.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.415
It's okay that you're scared.

01:29.298 --> 01:33.712
See, contrary to traditional
culinary practices,

01:33.928 --> 01:36.385
it actually tastes better
for someone like me

01:36.597 --> 01:38.838
when the kill's been frightened.

01:42.311 --> 01:43.687
Look at me, Kalissa.

01:43.896 --> 01:45.397
Open your eyes.

01:46.899 --> 01:48.400
Kalissa.

01:48.651 --> 01:49.766
Open your eyes!

02:14.719 --> 02:16.584
Wait, wait! Stop!

02:16.804 --> 02:17.964
The dead pool's over.

02:18.180 --> 02:20.796
You're not going to get paid.
It's over.

02:21.017 --> 02:23.303
I'm not here to kill you, Patrick.

02:23.519 --> 02:25.726
I'm taking you back to Eichen House.

02:26.022 --> 02:29.435
Where they know all about
your culinary practices.

02:38.534 --> 02:40.946
Are you... Are you a cop?

02:41.787 --> 02:43.072
Veterinarian.

02:49.462 --> 02:53.046
While I'm relieved
to have Patrick back in our care,

02:53.424 --> 02:56.666
I still need to
advise you against doing this, Alan.

02:57.053 --> 03:00.090
There's a reason
this floor isn't listed in the brochure.

03:00.306 --> 03:04.015
I came through on my end of our
bargain. Now it's your turn.

03:04.477 --> 03:06.433
All I want to do is talk to him.

03:07.938 --> 03:09.769
The last person that
went in to see Valack

03:09.982 --> 03:12.473
left the room but not the building.

03:12.693 --> 03:15.355
And all they did was talk.

03:15.571 --> 03:17.311
I'll keep that in mind.

03:32.380 --> 03:33.540
Dr. Valack?

03:34.090 --> 03:36.126
You must be important.

03:36.384 --> 03:39.091
They don't usually let
people get this close.

03:41.180 --> 03:43.045
They let me read.

03:43.265 --> 03:47.178
Unfortunately, all I get are these
trashy romance novels.

03:47.395 --> 03:49.602
I've read this one seven times.

03:49.814 --> 03:51.304
l was hoping we could talk.

03:51.482 --> 03:53.518
My name is Dr. Alan Deaton.

04:04.245 --> 04:07.157
Oh, I know your specialty,
Dr. Deaton.

04:07.373 --> 04:09.659
And I know it's not cats and dogs.

04:09.875 --> 04:12.958
I'm here because of what you know
about South American mythology.

04:13.170 --> 04:14.205
No.

04:15.381 --> 04:17.212
You want to know about Kate Argent.

04:18.426 --> 04:20.337
You want to know about La Loba.

04:20.553 --> 04:22.384
"The Bone Woman."

04:23.639 --> 04:26.301
I need to know what
she did to Derek Hale.

04:26.517 --> 04:27.882
And if he's dying.

04:28.185 --> 04:30.562
- Why?
- Because of a promise I made.

04:30.980 --> 04:32.470
To a woman I loved.

04:34.525 --> 04:36.766
Maybe you should write
the romance novels.

04:37.111 --> 04:40.148
If you want to know more, Dr. Deaton,

04:40.364 --> 04:43.322
- you have to come closer.
- I've been advised against that.

04:43.534 --> 04:46.697
| only want to talk.
To hear what you know.

04:47.246 --> 04:49.202
You need to see what I know.

04:49.915 --> 04:52.247
You do that by coming closer.

04:57.965 --> 05:00.547
I don't know much about trepanation,

05:00.760 --> 05:04.673
but I'm relatively certain that just because
you drilled a hole in your own head,

05:04.889 --> 05:08.381
it doesn't mean you've somehow gifted
yourself with extra-sensory perception.

05:08.559 --> 05:10.220
Come a little closer.

05:10.895 --> 05:12.760
Take a look for yourself.

05:14.398 --> 05:18.311
That's it. Come and have a look.

05:20.571 --> 05:22.061
Come on.

06:15.292 --> 06:17.328
Hey, sorry I'm back so late.

06:17.545 --> 06:19.752
l was closing up the Animal Clinic.

06:20.214 --> 06:22.455
I got more hours to earn a little extra

06:24.343 --> 06:25.423
money.

06:27.096 --> 06:28.927
How much more did you need?

06:30.140 --> 06:33.928
This is payment from the dead pool.
I found it in Garrett's locker.

06:35.104 --> 06:36.810
This belongs to Derek?

06:40.609 --> 06:43.146
So you're just, uh,
keeping it safe for him

06:43.362 --> 06:45.023
in a gym bag underneath your bed?

06:51.620 --> 06:53.121
How long have you had it?

06:55.541 --> 06:56.530
Too long.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.581
You know you have to give it back?

06:58.878 --> 07:01.665
- l was going to.
- Do I want to know why you haven't?

07:12.558 --> 07:14.094
Because of you.

07:15.060 --> 07:16.095
Me?

07:25.487 --> 07:27.569
You mean because
we've been struggling a little?

07:27.781 --> 07:31.319
Mom, we're struggling a lot.

07:31.911 --> 07:33.026
Oh...

07:36.040 --> 07:37.405
Scott...

07:39.209 --> 07:41.200
You can save people's lives,

07:41.420 --> 07:43.832
but you cannot save them from life.

07:44.048 --> 07:45.834
Life is full of struggles.

07:46.050 --> 07:48.382
- But it doesn't have to be.
- Honey...

07:48.594 --> 07:51.836
Do you know what just
one of these can do? Uh...

07:52.806 --> 07:57.015
This gets us a new roof.
And this pays for Stiles' MRI.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.309
This pays for Eichen House.

08:01.315 --> 08:02.521
And this one means

08:02.733 --> 08:04.598
you don't have to
work the double shift at the hospital

08:04.818 --> 08:06.683
and come home totally exhausted.

08:11.909 --> 08:13.274
What about this one?

08:38.978 --> 08:40.559
When did you get so good?

08:40.771 --> 08:42.227
You've been practicing?

08:42.439 --> 08:44.816
Or did you just suddenly
get superhuman reflexes?

08:45.109 --> 08:47.851
Uh... Practicing.

08:48.070 --> 08:50.402
Yeah, I've been practicing.

08:50.614 --> 08:52.400
And I should be studying.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.239
Where are you going?

08:54.451 --> 08:56.567
Home?
I got a History test tomorrow.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.323
Come on. One more game.

08:59.581 --> 09:01.958
Yeah, you said that four games ago.

09:04.169 --> 09:06.785
Well, study here. You can stay over.

09:08.215 --> 09:10.627
Come on, one more game. Just one.

09:11.301 --> 09:12.507
You okay?

09:16.724 --> 09:18.885
Yeah. You're right.

09:19.476 --> 09:20.932
You should go.

09:21.603 --> 09:23.059
I should probably study too.

09:29.153 --> 09:30.643
See you at school.

10:51.401 --> 10:52.857
You're not there.

10:53.695 --> 10:55.196
You're not there.

11:32.442 --> 11:33.431
Braeden.

12:21.867 --> 12:23.073
Stiles.

12:23.285 --> 12:24.570
Stiles!

12:24.786 --> 12:27.528
You've got an early morning practice for
the big game tomorrow, remember?

12:27.748 --> 12:28.828
All right.

12:29.583 --> 12:32.120
If I'm going to watch an entire lacrosse
game, you better not suck.

12:32.336 --> 12:33.542
Not gonna suck.

12:33.754 --> 12:35.335
Remember you were
supposed to drive me to school early

12:35.547 --> 12:37.253
so I can get more studying in
for the math test?

12:37.466 --> 12:40.424
The one that determines whether or not
I'm gonna be a senior with you next year?

12:40.636 --> 12:41.921
Stiles!

12:57.986 --> 13:00.944
What are you doing?
I haven't even brushed my teeth yet.

13:01.156 --> 13:02.441
I don't care.

13:19.007 --> 13:19.962
Okay.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.215
Don't you wanna
know why it took so long to return it?

13:22.427 --> 13:24.088
How much do you make
at the Animal Clinic?

13:24.263 --> 13:26.504
- Minimum wage.
- That's why.

13:27.307 --> 13:30.424
Everyone can be tempted, Scott.
Even a True Alpha.

13:30.644 --> 13:33.477
- You're not angry?
- It's not even mine. It belongs to Peter.

13:34.106 --> 13:36.973
- Where's your money?
- You're standing on it.

13:41.822 --> 13:44.154
- There's another vault?
- No.

13:44.783 --> 13:45.898
I own the building.

13:47.035 --> 13:50.072
And I have my own bank accounts.
All the money from the vault was Peter's.

13:50.247 --> 13:53.239
I think we'd actually
be better off if the rest never came back.

13:58.630 --> 14:00.131
I know Lydia was here last night.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.832
Deaton's still working
on figuring out what Kate did to you.

14:04.011 --> 14:06.127
If anyone can find an answer,

14:06.346 --> 14:07.677
it's him.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.311
Keep monitoring him every hour.

15:03.195 --> 15:04.526
If nothing changes...

15:07.240 --> 15:08.696
They never listen.

15:08.909 --> 15:11.116
Lydia? Lydia.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.697
Did you hear me? Look.

15:14.289 --> 15:15.324
I passed.

15:16.541 --> 15:17.496
C-minus.

15:17.709 --> 15:20.576
Your notes are great
when they're not written in code.

15:22.756 --> 15:24.747
Disappointed, Malia.

15:25.092 --> 15:27.253
Profoundly disappointed.

15:32.057 --> 15:33.467
I'll send you my notes.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.827
It's over.
The computers are off.

15:53.036 --> 15:55.277
No more assassins.
No more murders.

15:55.497 --> 15:57.033
No one's dying.

16:01.878 --> 16:02.958
Not yet.

16:06.216 --> 16:07.376
That's a lot of weight.

16:08.468 --> 16:09.969
Gotta get ready for the game tomorrow.

16:10.178 --> 16:11.793
- You need a spot?
- No.

16:13.598 --> 16:14.678
Do you?

16:15.267 --> 16:18.134
This is my warm-up, you ass.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.016
Wait, what are you doing?

16:22.357 --> 16:23.437
I'm spotting you.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.231
- I said I don't need one.
- Are you kidding me?

16:25.444 --> 16:28.777
This is, like, 300 pounds.
You're gonna kill yourself.

16:44.296 --> 16:45.832
Do I look like I need help?

17:30.091 --> 17:31.046
Liam?

17:32.344 --> 17:33.584
I'm fine.

17:35.138 --> 17:37.049
If you don't want to
be with us, that's okay.

17:37.265 --> 17:39.347
But don't push your friends away too.

18:16.846 --> 18:19.804
- How'd you find her?
- Keen sense of smell. You?

18:21.476 --> 18:22.761
This came out of Scott's side.

18:26.481 --> 18:29.097
It's used by water treatment
plants as an anti-corrosive.

18:29.276 --> 18:33.189
You tracked Kate and her Berserkers
all the way down here.

18:33.405 --> 18:35.316
That's very impressive.

18:35.782 --> 18:38.444
I wonder if one of them
might still be around.

19:02.100 --> 19:03.556
Doesn't look like Derek's home.

19:04.394 --> 19:05.349
He's not.

19:06.104 --> 19:07.719
Then how come we're
stopping here first?

19:08.982 --> 19:10.017
You'll see.

19:12.110 --> 19:13.350
I can't see anything.

19:13.570 --> 19:15.106
Can you turn on the lights?

19:16.156 --> 19:18.943
Yeah, actually, I need you to do that.

19:39.387 --> 19:40.547
Did I do okay?

19:41.473 --> 19:44.306
For our first real date? It's a start.

19:53.193 --> 19:54.729
Did you bring a movie?

19:56.237 --> 19:57.773
I borrowed it from Stiles.

19:57.989 --> 20:01.152
He says you've never seen it and
that he's going to kill you if you don't.

20:01.576 --> 20:03.237
Star Wars.

20:07.957 --> 20:09.333
Where's the TV?

20:19.260 --> 20:21.046
So, this is the fourth one?

20:21.262 --> 20:23.924
No, it's the first one.
Even though it says fourth.

20:24.140 --> 20:26.882
- Then what's the first one?
- The fourth one.

20:27.268 --> 20:29.930
You know what?
Forget the movie.

21:49.559 --> 21:50.674
Scott?

22:09.913 --> 22:12.029
Drop what you're doing.
I'm taking you both out to dinner.

22:12.207 --> 22:13.492
Whatever you want.

22:14.375 --> 22:18.084
Dad, I don't think a man of your debts
should be treating anyone to anything.

22:18.296 --> 22:20.912
Well, there's one debt
we no longer have to worry about.

22:21.132 --> 22:22.338
What is that?

22:22.550 --> 22:24.211
A letter of apology
from Eichen House.

22:24.427 --> 22:28.090
Apparently, they've decided
to forgive our debt due to, uh...

22:28.848 --> 22:31.260
Well, you and Lydia
almost getting murdered.

22:31.768 --> 22:34.555
- They could do that?
- They can do it and they did it.

22:35.188 --> 22:37.520
I have never been so happy
to have almost been murdered.

22:37.732 --> 22:41.224
Well, we're not out of it yet, but...
We're going to be okay.

22:42.153 --> 22:44.940
And at least for the moment,
I can afford to take my son

22:45.156 --> 22:46.612
and his girlfriend out to dinner.

22:48.284 --> 22:50.195
Malia, what's your favorite food?

22:50.370 --> 22:51.325
DeeL

22:53.581 --> 22:54.570
Pizza.

22:55.041 --> 22:56.156
She likes pizza.

23:01.798 --> 23:05.962
Unfortunately, while I promised Kate
that I wouldn't kill you,

23:07.595 --> 23:09.301
I also can't let you leave.

23:19.566 --> 23:21.807
No, no, no, no, no.

23:22.026 --> 23:23.106
Allow me.

23:34.664 --> 23:36.450
Now you rest here a while.

23:36.875 --> 23:40.163
You've had a hard time,
for a very long time.

23:49.846 --> 23:51.211
I know something's going on.

23:51.431 --> 23:53.843
I know you don't want to talk about it.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.386
But you're still my best friend.

23:58.062 --> 23:59.097
And, um...

24:00.565 --> 24:04.057
Considering the fact
that the last good friend I made

24:04.277 --> 24:07.064
turned out to be a professional killer,

24:07.280 --> 24:10.192
I'm thinking that I don't have
too many options for new ones.

24:10.408 --> 24:14.902
So when you're ready to talk, talk.

24:15.663 --> 24:16.948
Until then,

24:17.165 --> 24:20.703
I know I can kick your ass
at at least one of these games.

24:29.510 --> 24:31.125
Never played this one.

26:41.976 --> 26:43.307
What do you want from us?

26:43.519 --> 26:45.555
I want a little bit of insight, Scott.

26:45.772 --> 26:48.104
- To what?
- My family.

26:48.608 --> 26:51.816
The Argent family has been
around for over 400 years.

26:52.028 --> 26:55.316
A powerful, wealthy, aristocratic family

26:55.573 --> 26:56.938
of werewolf hunters.

26:57.158 --> 27:00.025
But yet somehow, in less than a year,

27:00.536 --> 27:02.527
this great family is decimated

27:02.747 --> 27:04.487
by a teenage boy.

27:07.126 --> 27:09.117
So my question is simple.

27:11.631 --> 27:17.251
What the hell is
so special about Scott McCall?

27:20.181 --> 27:21.591
You want me?

27:22.558 --> 27:23.593
Take me.

27:24.185 --> 27:25.140
Just me.

27:25.728 --> 27:27.593
No, no, we're all going.

27:29.148 --> 27:31.059
We're all going to church!

27:41.661 --> 27:43.572
Everything's fine.
I got a text from him this morning,

27:43.746 --> 27:44.906
he said he might be a little late.

27:45.123 --> 27:47.079
Well, how late is late?
Is he always late?

27:47.291 --> 27:50.283
We're playing Devenford Prep again
and this time it's an actual game. He...

27:50.503 --> 27:52.459
- He shouldn't be late.
- Who shouldn't be late?

27:56.968 --> 27:59.254
- Scott and Kira.
- They might be slightly late.

28:00.096 --> 28:03.338
Slightly late is still late.
What are they doing?

28:07.645 --> 28:10.102
They're doing something
that's going to make them slightly late.

28:10.398 --> 28:14.232
What could Scott and
Kira be doing right now

28:14.443 --> 28:16.570
that's more important
than playing in the first game?

28:22.910 --> 28:24.195
Oh, Coach.

28:37.675 --> 28:38.790
Can we sit here?

28:46.225 --> 28:47.340
They're still not here.

28:47.560 --> 28:49.471
Okay, what's really going on?

28:49.687 --> 28:52.599
Are you nervous about the full moon?
It's not for another 24 hours.

28:55.276 --> 28:57.187
Liam, you're gonna be fine. Okay?

28:57.403 --> 28:59.610
Just try not to rage out on anyone.

28:59.780 --> 29:02.157
- You're not worried?
- Okay, I'm mildly concerned.

29:02.366 --> 29:03.481
Mildly.

29:10.249 --> 29:12.331
- We're gonna lose without him.
- No, we're not.

29:12.543 --> 29:14.283
We can be just as good without Scott.

29:14.503 --> 29:17.336
Okay? I've been practicing.
Let me tell you something.

29:17.548 --> 29:20.005
I'm getting good. Really good.

29:33.856 --> 29:35.312
Yeah. I'm gonna call Scott again.

29:40.655 --> 29:41.770
They're gone.

29:44.325 --> 29:47.067
- How long have you been like this?
- I don't know.

29:48.663 --> 29:51.405
- Might have blacked out a few times.
- Peter Hale did this?

29:51.582 --> 29:54.039
- You were following him?
- Every day since Meredith Walker.

29:55.044 --> 29:58.127
Listen to me.
Kate's going after Scott.

29:58.923 --> 30:00.038
Peter and Kate.

30:01.175 --> 30:02.460
You've got to warn them.

30:02.635 --> 30:04.671
lcant
There's no service down here.

30:04.845 --> 30:06.005
Then just go.

30:06.931 --> 30:09.718
If I leave right now,
you'll be dead by the time I get back.

30:10.810 --> 30:12.266
We're getting you out of here.

30:20.236 --> 30:21.396
Come on!

30:27.076 --> 30:29.692
Neither of them are answering.
I gotta go see what's going on.

30:29.912 --> 30:31.413
You're leaving?
What are you going to tell Coach?

30:32.832 --> 30:34.993
Stupid! Stupid old...

30:35.209 --> 30:37.746
Uh, you don't tell
him anything. Okay?

30:37.962 --> 30:40.203
Liam, you're gonna be okay. All right?

30:53.185 --> 30:55.176
Want me to stay here
if he shows up?

30:55.396 --> 30:56.556
Yes.

30:58.316 --> 31:00.728
Liam! Get on the field!

31:01.068 --> 31:02.683
Go Brett! Come on!

31:04.322 --> 31:06.563
- Go, Brett, go!
- Come on, Brett!

31:44.820 --> 31:45.809
Liam!

31:46.030 --> 31:48.692
For the love of God, move!

32:19.939 --> 32:21.475
So...

32:23.234 --> 32:24.519
Who's winning?

32:29.115 --> 32:30.195
Still nothing.

32:30.408 --> 32:32.865
I think we're going
to have to move him to the sixth floor.

32:33.077 --> 32:34.487
You're not taking him anywhere.

32:36.330 --> 32:38.867
Well, unless you're family,
I don't think you can make that decision.

32:39.625 --> 32:40.910
We're close enough.

32:43.212 --> 32:46.079
- Let me talk to him.
- He's not responding to any stimuli.

32:46.257 --> 32:47.417
We can talk to him,

32:47.633 --> 32:50.295
but there's no way of knowing
he's actually hearing us.

32:50.511 --> 32:52.047
Trust me on this.

32:53.097 --> 32:54.382
He'll hear me.

33:02.064 --> 33:02.814
Come on, Liam.

33:18.664 --> 33:20.074
What the hell did you do that for?

33:20.249 --> 33:23.116
Because you're afraid.
I can smell it on you from across the field.

33:23.335 --> 33:24.370
- Are you hurt?
- No.

33:24.587 --> 33:25.997
- Are you still alive?
- Obviously.

33:26.172 --> 33:27.252
Then get up.

33:30.593 --> 33:31.628
You good to play?

33:33.012 --> 33:34.502
You planning on pulling
something like that again?

33:34.722 --> 33:36.087
Only if I have to.

33:43.981 --> 33:45.391
I told you not to come here.

33:45.608 --> 33:47.144
If you want to have
a clandestine meeting

33:47.359 --> 33:49.145
you need to choose
a clandestine location.

33:49.361 --> 33:50.692
After what happened
with you and Meredith,

33:50.905 --> 33:52.770
I'm pretty sure
I can do without any kind of

33:52.990 --> 33:54.150
one-on-one father-daughter time.

33:54.366 --> 33:56.197
How about mother-daughter time?

33:58.496 --> 33:59.861
That's right.

34:00.080 --> 34:01.991
I found our Desert Wolf.

34:06.170 --> 34:07.751
Is she definitely my mother?

34:11.675 --> 34:12.630
Yes.

34:14.303 --> 34:15.588
But if you want to find her,

34:15.804 --> 34:17.340
you're going to have
to do something for me.

34:17.556 --> 34:20.798
Something that's come naturally to you
for a very long time.

34:22.144 --> 34:24.009
Do you always have to
get something in return?

34:24.188 --> 34:26.395
When it's something
I can't do on my own? Yes.

34:30.444 --> 34:31.399
What do you want?

34:36.200 --> 34:38.282
I want you to kill Kate Argent.

35:16.448 --> 35:17.528
Scott?

35:34.258 --> 35:35.498
Scott?

35:38.220 --> 35:39.596
Scott!

35:49.189 --> 35:50.144
You okay?

35:52.693 --> 35:53.773
We lost.

35:53.986 --> 35:55.772
But you're okay, right?

35:58.490 --> 35:59.866
Why'd you do that?

36:00.284 --> 36:02.866
- Why'd you help me?
- Because of Scott.

36:03.329 --> 36:04.694
He saved me.

36:05.372 --> 36:06.873
He saved all of us.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.456
Do you know how lucky you are?

36:10.252 --> 36:11.287
What do you mean?

36:11.503 --> 36:13.710
Scott's a True Alpha.

36:13.922 --> 36:16.299
That means he didn't get his power
because he was born with it.

36:16.467 --> 36:19.049
He didn't get it
by stealing or by killing someone.

36:19.720 --> 36:21.176
He earned it.

36:23.432 --> 36:26.549
You're not strong just because you
can lift a lot of weight now.

36:26.769 --> 36:29.135
You're strong because you endure.

36:29.355 --> 36:32.267
Satomi calls it strength of character.

36:34.026 --> 36:35.436
You're lucky to have him.

36:40.449 --> 36:42.155
Then why isn't he here?

36:47.706 --> 36:48.912
I'm sorry.

36:49.500 --> 36:50.455
I'm sorry.

36:53.337 --> 36:54.577
I can't do it myself.

36:56.215 --> 36:58.672
It's not bending back
and it's not coming out of the wall.

36:59.218 --> 37:00.207
Leave.

37:01.887 --> 37:03.297
I can't do that either.

37:05.182 --> 37:07.218
I need you to help me.

37:07.434 --> 37:09.174
I know you're hurt and tired,

37:09.395 --> 37:12.637
but I need you to gather everything
you've got and help me.

37:12.856 --> 37:14.266
I've got nothing.

37:15.192 --> 37:16.557
Grab the bar, sir.

37:19.321 --> 37:20.777
I've got nothing left.

37:22.157 --> 37:23.146
Please,

37:24.368 --> 37:25.483
just go.

37:26.704 --> 37:29.286
- You're running out of time.
- You know what you need?

37:30.040 --> 37:31.120
Adrenaline.

37:31.625 --> 37:33.240
There's two ways to get it.

37:33.460 --> 37:35.997
Fear and anger.
Since you don't look like a guy

37:36.213 --> 37:38.750
who's afraid of anything,
you need to get angry.

37:38.966 --> 37:40.877
You need to get so angry
that your brain lets loose

37:41.093 --> 37:43.084
every bit of adrenaline it has left.

37:43.303 --> 37:45.089
I'm too tired to be angry.

37:46.598 --> 37:47.724
Okay.

37:49.226 --> 37:52.468
I don't know much about you
or what you've been through.

37:53.939 --> 37:55.679
But Lydia told me some of it.

37:59.361 --> 38:01.067
And I know about Allison.

38:04.283 --> 38:06.399
I know how she felt about Scott.

38:07.453 --> 38:09.193
And I think if she knew
what was happening to him

38:09.413 --> 38:10.698
she'd be pretty angry.

38:10.914 --> 38:12.745
At least angry enough
to try one more time

38:12.958 --> 38:14.289
to get the hell out of here.

38:15.002 --> 38:16.742
So whatever trigger you need,

38:16.962 --> 38:19.453
if it's Allison, or your sister,

38:19.673 --> 38:21.254
or Peter, use it!

38:22.217 --> 38:23.548
Use it right now!

38:52.122 --> 38:53.498
What the hell happened?

38:54.124 --> 38:56.501
- It was supposed to be a date.
- They were both here?

38:56.710 --> 38:58.246
And they're both gone.

39:02.299 --> 39:04.085
- Hey.
- Scott's been taken.

39:04.301 --> 39:06.087
Scott and Kira.
We just don't know where.

39:06.303 --> 39:07.258
Mexico.

39:07.471 --> 39:10.508
And if you want to save his life,
that's where you're going too.

39:23.278 --> 39:24.563
Tell me, Scott.

39:29.868 --> 39:33.827
They ever teach you the myth
of Artemis and Actaeon in school?

39:38.210 --> 39:40.075
No?
I didn't think so.

39:41.713 --> 39:42.748
Well,

39:42.965 --> 39:44.421
Artemis was a goddess,

39:44.633 --> 39:47.500
and Actaeon was a hunter
that happened to see Artemis

39:47.719 --> 39:49.584
bathing naked one day.

39:51.348 --> 39:53.839
Well, this did not make
the goddess too happy.

39:54.059 --> 39:56.596
In fact, she was so angry,

39:56.812 --> 39:59.053
Artemis turned Actaeon into a deer

39:59.273 --> 40:02.936
and this sent his
own hounds into a frenzy.

40:04.403 --> 40:06.064
He was actually torn apart

40:06.280 --> 40:08.987
by his own hunting dogs.

40:20.711 --> 40:22.167
What are you doing?

40:23.797 --> 40:25.958
I'm not gonna turn you into a deer.

40:27.676 --> 40:28.631
But,

40:28.844 --> 40:30.630
you are about to become something

40:30.846 --> 40:33.337
unrecognizable to your friends.

40:34.975 --> 40:37.512
They won't know
what they're fighting,

40:38.020 --> 40:39.180
or killing.

40:39.855 --> 40:40.935
Kate, hold on...

40:42.065 --> 40:43.350
Kate, no!

40:44.151 --> 40:45.266
No, Kate, no.

40:45.819 --> 40:47.184
No, Kate! Don't!

40:49.740 --> 40:52.732
Wait! Kate, no, no! No!

40:52.951 --> 40:54.282
Wait. No, no!

40:54.578 --> 40:56.489
Kate, don't! No! Stop!

40:56.663 --> 40:57.994
Wait, no!
