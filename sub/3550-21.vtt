WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.133
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.133 --> 00:04.305
THIS THIEF WAS TRYING
TO STEAL YOUR TRUCK!

00:04.305 --> 00:07.038
YOU'RE THE GUY WHO'S FOUR MONTHS
BEHIND ON HIS PAYMENTS?
 YEAH.

00:07.038 --> 00:11.182
MIKE RELUCTANTLY BORROWED MONEY
FROM CARLOS.

00:11.182 --> 00:14.745
TELL ME HOW MUCH YOU NEED.
 (pen clicks)

00:14.745 --> 00:16.317
ANDREW DID HIS HOMEWORK.

00:16.317 --> 00:19.190
I MADE A FEW CALLS.
TURNS OUT THE GOLDEN CHILD

00:19.190 --> 00:21.522
NEVER GOT HIS DEGREE.
 I LEFT SCHOOL

00:21.522 --> 00:24.155
WHEN THE DOCTOR TOLD ME
MY MOTHER WAS TERMINAL.

00:24.155 --> 00:26.427
I CAN SAVE YOU A PHONE CALL
AND BRING IN

00:26.427 --> 00:28.099
HER DEATH CERTIFICATE.
 THAT'S OKAY. (clears throat)

00:28.099 --> 00:30.661
THE WORST MISTAKE I EVER MADE
IN MY LIFE WAS HAVING YOU!

00:30.661 --> 00:33.033
A KILLER...
 (grunts)

00:33.033 --> 00:34.405
GOT AN INVITATION.

00:34.405 --> 00:37.338
WE WOULD LIKE IT
IF YOU WOULD MOVE IN WITH US.
 OKAY.

00:37.338 --> 00:39.570
AND ANGIE REVEALED HER PAST.

00:39.570 --> 00:41.612
I GOT INVOLVED
WITH A REALLY BAD GUY--

00:41.612 --> 00:43.614
DANNY'S FATHER.

00:48.379 --> 00:50.381
(Mary Alice) MANY YEARS AGO,

00:50.381 --> 00:52.823
A TERRORIST FELL IN LOVE
WITH A WOMAN.

00:52.823 --> 00:55.686
(alarm clock rings,
ringing stops)

00:57.258 --> 00:59.630
THIS WOMAN BELIEVED
IN THE TERRORIST

00:59.630 --> 01:01.732
AND HIS CAUSE...

01:01.732 --> 01:04.063
(sizzling)

01:04.063 --> 01:07.568
UNTIL AN UNDERCOVER AGENT
SHOWED UP,

01:07.568 --> 01:10.201
DETERMINED TO STOP THEM.

01:11.842 --> 01:14.505
THE TERRORIST WANTED TO ATTACK

01:14.505 --> 01:18.078
THOSE HE FELT WERE HURTING
THE PLANET,

01:18.078 --> 01:23.414
SO HE GOT THE WOMAN
TO HELP HIM BUILD A BOMB.

01:23.414 --> 01:26.187
BUT SOMETHING WENT WRONG,

01:26.187 --> 01:30.121
AND SOMEONE
WAS UNEXPECTEDLY KILLED.

01:30.121 --> 01:33.564
THE TERRORIST DIDN'T CARE.

01:33.564 --> 01:37.097
HE SAID IT WAS UNAVOIDABLE.

01:37.097 --> 01:41.101
THE WOMAN WANTED
TO TURN HERSELF IN,

01:41.101 --> 01:43.604
BUT SHE WAS PREGNANT.

01:43.604 --> 01:48.179
SO THE AGENT CONVINCED HER
TO RUN AWAY WITH HIM,

01:48.179 --> 01:51.882
AND HE'D RAISE THE CHILD
AS HIS OWN.

01:51.882 --> 01:56.447
(car alarm chirps)
 SO THEY ESCAPED
FROM THE TERRORIST,

01:56.447 --> 01:59.450
HOPING AND PRAYING

01:59.450 --> 02:02.523
HE WOULD NEVER FIND THEM.

02:02.523 --> 02:04.225
(door bells jingle)

02:04.225 --> 02:05.556
UNFORTUNATELY...

02:05.556 --> 02:07.458
HE DID.

02:07.458 --> 02:11.202
HEY. IF IT ISN'T
DOUBLE CAPPUCCINO, EXTRA HOT.

02:11.202 --> 02:13.434
(chuckles)
YOU KNOW ME SO WELL.

02:13.434 --> 02:15.866
(chuckles) JUST MADE
CHOCOLATE SCONES.

02:15.866 --> 02:18.138
INTERESTED?

02:18.138 --> 02:19.610
AH, WHAT THE HELL?

02:19.610 --> 02:22.513
MIGHT AS WELL
LIVE DANGEROUSLY.

02:22.513 --> 02:24.515
SO HOW'S THE NOVEL COMIN'?

02:24.515 --> 02:26.177
ALMOST DONE.

02:26.177 --> 02:27.848
ENDINGS ARE A BITCH.

02:27.848 --> 02:29.850
I REALLY NEED
TO SURPRISE MY AUDIENCE.

02:29.850 --> 02:31.882
(door bells jingle)

02:31.882 --> 02:34.485
HEY.
I KNOW YOU'RE MY DAD...

02:34.485 --> 02:37.488
BUT YOU STILL GOTTA CLOSE
THE DOOR WHEN YOU COME IN.

02:37.488 --> 02:39.190
OH, SORRY.
 MM-HMM.

02:39.190 --> 02:41.932
NO, I WAS JUST GONNA, UH,
I WAS GONNA ASK YOU SOMETHIN'.

02:41.932 --> 02:44.835
YOU WANT TO JOIN YOUR OLD MAN
FOR A RUN TONIGHT?

02:44.835 --> 02:47.638
UH, DAD, YOU DON'T RUN.
YOU JOG.

02:47.638 --> 02:49.340
(clears throat) AND NO.

02:49.340 --> 02:52.343
COME ON. I'LL BE GOING BY
THE PARK. IT'LL BE REAL PRETTY.

02:52.343 --> 02:54.805
I'M WORKING EDDIE'S SHIFT
TONIGHT.
 AH.

02:54.805 --> 02:57.478
I'M GONNA BE HERE LATE.

02:57.478 --> 03:01.412
BUT I AM PROUD OF YOU.

03:01.412 --> 03:02.913
KEEP IT UP.

03:02.913 --> 03:06.186
YEAH. THANKS, COACH.
 MM-HMM.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.488
SEE YOU AT HOME.

03:07.488 --> 03:09.720
(door bells jingle)

03:13.294 --> 03:14.795
THAT'S YOUR DAD?

03:14.795 --> 03:16.527
YEAH.

03:16.527 --> 03:19.900
I SHOULD HAVE INTRODUCED YOU.
YOU'D LIKE HIM.

03:19.900 --> 03:23.234
YEAH, I BET I WOULD.
SO HE'S A RUNNER?

03:23.234 --> 03:24.935
EVERY NIGHT,
EVEN WHEN HE'S SICK.

03:24.935 --> 03:26.707
YOU CAN'T STOP HIM.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.479
(both chuckle)

03:28.479 --> 03:30.481
HE'S PRETTY INSPIRING.

03:30.481 --> 03:33.213
INSPIRING?

03:33.213 --> 03:35.886
DON'T GUYS YOUR AGE
USUALLY HATE THEIR DADS?

03:35.886 --> 03:39.720
WE'VE HAD OUR ISSUES.
(chuckles)

03:39.720 --> 03:43.254
BUT MY DAD'S SACRIFICED A LOT
FOR ME.

03:43.254 --> 03:46.727
I FIGURE THIS IS
HOW I PAY HIM BACK.

03:51.001 --> 03:52.633
YOU'RE RIGHT.

03:54.735 --> 03:58.309
PAYBACK'S REALLY IMPORTANT.

03:58.309 --> 04:00.371
ALL RIGHT, BACK IN A BIT.

04:00.371 --> 04:02.373
HOW LONG ARE YOU GONNA BE?

04:02.373 --> 04:04.875
JUST LONG ENOUGH TO GET
A LITTLE SWEATY. MWAH.

04:04.875 --> 04:07.247
YOU BE CAREFUL.
 YEAH.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.779
(door opens)

04:12.022 --> 04:15.956
IT TOOK THE TERRORIST
20 YEARS

04:15.956 --> 04:18.488
TO FIND THE PEOPLE
WHO HAD BETRAYED HIM.

04:20.531 --> 04:23.694
WHAT THE...
 (tires squeal)

04:23.694 --> 04:26.297
(engine revs)

04:31.271 --> 04:33.874
AND HIS PLAN FOR REVENGE...

04:33.874 --> 04:47.318
WAS JUST GETTING STARTED.

04:47.318 --> 04:48.789
(children shouting indistinctly)

04:48.789 --> 04:53.324
OUR MOTHERS TELL US
TO BEWARE OF MYSTERIOUS MEN.

04:54.865 --> 04:57.668
DON'T TALK TO THEM IN THE PARK.

04:58.929 --> 05:01.932
DON'T TAKE THEIR CANDY.

05:01.932 --> 05:06.737
DON'T GET INTO THEIR CARS.

05:06.737 --> 05:09.780
AND WHATEVER YOU DO...
 (door squeaks)

05:09.780 --> 05:13.744
DON'T LET THEM INTO THE HOUSE.

05:15.446 --> 05:18.449
BUT WHAT DO WE DO WHEN MOTHER

05:18.449 --> 05:21.892
HAS ALREADY INVITED THEM IN?

05:21.892 --> 05:23.924
OH, MY GOSH.

05:23.924 --> 05:26.457
EDDIE, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

05:26.457 --> 05:28.799
I SAW YOU WERE RUNNING LOW
ON SUPPLIES,

05:28.799 --> 05:31.902
SO I WENT TO THE STORE FOR YOU.
 OH, YOU DIDN'T NEED
TO DO THAT.

05:31.902 --> 05:34.034
HEY, YOU'RE COOL ENOUGH
TO TAKE ME IN.

05:34.034 --> 05:36.807
I GOTTA EARN MY KEEP
SOMEHOW.
 (chuckles)

05:36.807 --> 05:39.069
I BOUGHT FRESH VEGETABLES.

05:39.069 --> 05:42.413
OKAY, NOW YOU'RE JUST
TRYING TO MAKE ME CRY.

05:42.413 --> 05:43.914
(buzzer sounds)

05:43.914 --> 05:46.377
IS THAT THE LAUNDRY?
I'LL GET THAT.

05:46.377 --> 05:50.050
OH, THAT'S OKAY.
IT'S PORTER'S TURN.
 I CAN'T, MOM. I'M LATE.

05:50.050 --> 05:52.953
YOU CAN SPARE FIVE MINUTES
TO PUT CLOTHES IN THE DRYER.

05:52.953 --> 05:56.086
NO, I CAN'T. JEREMY AND DAVE ARE
WAITING TO TAKE ME TO THE MALL.

05:56.086 --> 05:59.460
YOU ARE NOT LEAVING WET CLOTHES
IN THAT WASHER.

05:59.460 --> 06:01.392
MOM, CHILL. IT'S WATER.

06:01.392 --> 06:04.395
HEY, DON'T TALK TO YOUR MOTHER
LIKE THAT.

06:04.395 --> 06:06.597
(horn honks)

06:06.597 --> 06:08.869
OKAY, THAT'S MY RIDE.
I GOTTA GO.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.442
UNH-UNH. AFTER THE LAUNDRY.

06:11.442 --> 06:14.074
(under breath) WHAT A BITCH.

06:14.074 --> 06:15.976
(Eddie and Porter grunt)
 HEY!

06:15.976 --> 06:18.378
TELL HER YOU'RE SORRY.
 (Lynette) HEY!

06:18.378 --> 06:19.910
GET OFF ME!
 APOLOGIZE!

06:19.910 --> 06:21.912
(grunts)
 EDDIE, EDDIE, EDDIE!

06:21.912 --> 06:24.955
HE SHOULDN'T TALK TO YOU
LIKE THAT!
 OKAY, OKAY!
I'M SURE HE'S VERY SORRY.

06:24.955 --> 06:27.057
STOP! STOP IT! STOP.
LET HIM UP.

06:28.989 --> 06:30.421
(pants)

06:30.421 --> 06:32.062
(pants)

06:34.024 --> 06:36.867
YOU OKAY?
 I'M FINE.

06:36.867 --> 06:40.030
GO JOIN YOUR FRIENDS.

06:40.030 --> 06:41.572
GO ON.

06:41.572 --> 06:44.134
(sighs)

06:44.134 --> 06:47.007
I'M SORRY.

06:47.007 --> 06:50.681
I JUST CAN'T WATCH YOU
BE DISRESPECTED.

06:52.743 --> 06:55.115
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THE LAUNDRY.

07:01.922 --> 07:04.094
(doorbell rings)

07:04.094 --> 07:06.527
HEY, CARLOS.
UH, HERE'S THE MONEY--

07:06.527 --> 07:08.529
(loudly) FOR THE CHURCH RAFFLE!
THANKS, MIKE!

07:08.529 --> 07:10.861
NOW SISTER MARY CAN FINALLY
REPLACE HER WOODEN...

07:10.861 --> 07:12.863
(normal voice) GABY'S HOME.
 OH, GOD. SORRY.

07:12.863 --> 07:15.866
I JUST WANTED TO BRING YOU
THE FIRST PAYMENT FOR THE LOAN.

07:15.866 --> 07:18.739
AND THANKS AGAIN.
YOU REALLY SAVED MY ASS.
 NO PROBLEM.

07:18.739 --> 07:21.542
AND JUST SO YOU KNOW,
I'M MAKING A LOT OF CUTBACKS

07:21.542 --> 07:24.875
SO I CAN PAY YOU BACK QUICKER--
NO VACATIONS, BASIC CABLE.

07:24.875 --> 07:27.578
I EVEN CONVINCED M.J.
THAT MRS. McCLUSKEY'S HOUSE

07:27.578 --> 07:31.121
IS SUMMER CAMP.
 (chuckles) LOOK, DON'T GO CRAZY.
JUST PAY IT BACK WHEN YOU CAN.

07:31.121 --> 07:34.955
AND LET'S MAKE SURE GABY
DOESN'T FIND OUT.
 SO SHE CAN TELL SUSAN?
NO PROBLEM.

07:34.955 --> 07:38.088
I GOTTA GET GOING. BYE.
 (loudly) HEY, AND UH, GIVE
MY BEST TO SISTER CARRIE.

07:38.088 --> 07:40.631
(lowered voice) MARY.
 MARY!

07:40.631 --> 07:43.494
(exhales deeply)

07:45.566 --> 07:46.967
WHOA.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.799
I KNOW, RIGHT?

07:48.799 --> 07:51.542
IT'S THE MIDDLE
OF THE AFTERNOON.

07:51.542 --> 07:54.905
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
 WHY DON'T YOU COME UPSTAIRS
AND FIND OUT?

07:54.905 --> 07:57.107
(sighs)

07:57.107 --> 07:59.209
NO, THANKS.
I CAN'T AFFORD IT.

07:59.209 --> 08:02.112
WHAT?
 EVERY TIME YOU OFFER ME
AFTERNOON SEX,

08:02.112 --> 08:04.114
IT'S BECAUSE
YOU WANT SOMETHING,

08:04.114 --> 08:05.956
AND IT IS NOT AFTERNOON SEX.

08:05.956 --> 08:08.659
(scoffs)

08:08.659 --> 08:11.261
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
CHECK THIS OUT.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.195
WHERE WERE
YOU EVEN HIDING THIS?

08:15.195 --> 08:17.628
OH. THAT IS A SKI CHALET
IN ASPEN.

08:17.628 --> 08:19.630
IT'S FOR SALE,
AND I WANT IT.

08:19.630 --> 08:22.102
SORRY, HON,
NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

08:22.102 --> 08:25.976
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
THAT WAS JUST MY OPENING OFFER.

08:25.976 --> 08:29.139
WHAT IF I SEE YOUR AFTERNOON SEX
AND RAISE YOU... HONEYMOON SEX?

08:31.111 --> 08:34.815
NO. NO, I CAN'T. ALL OF OUR CASH
IS TIED UP IN A BUSINESS DEAL.

08:34.815 --> 08:38.018
WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS DEAL?
 AH, YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO BORE YOU WITH THE DETAILS.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.520
HALF THAT MONEY IS MINE.
BORE ME.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.852
THIS CONVERSATION IS OVER.

08:42.852 --> 08:45.025
NOW IF YOU'RE INTERESTED
IN GOING UPSTAIRS

08:45.025 --> 08:48.829
AND MAKING LOVE TO YOUR HUSBAND
SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU...

08:48.829 --> 08:51.001
OKAY.

08:51.001 --> 08:53.864
(Mike clears throat)
 (chords play)

08:53.864 --> 08:57.568
(chuckles) LIKE IT?
I'VE BEEN PRACTICING ALL DAY.

08:57.568 --> 09:01.572
SUSAN, WHY IS THERE
A BIG-ASS PIANO IN OUR HOUSE?

09:01.572 --> 09:03.974
ACTUALLY, BIG-ASS STOPPED
MAKING PIANOS.

09:03.974 --> 09:08.278
THIS IS A YAMAHA.

09:08.278 --> 09:10.050
SO I'M...

09:10.050 --> 09:11.722
CURIOUS...

09:11.722 --> 09:14.585
HOW MUCH DID THIS THING COST?

09:14.585 --> 09:16.286
IT WAS FREE.

09:16.286 --> 09:18.228
(laughs)

09:18.228 --> 09:21.161
YOU REMEMBER DEAR, SWEET,
98-YEAR-OLD AUNT REGINA?

09:21.161 --> 09:23.193
THE ONE YOU CALLED
"THE CRYPT KEEPER"?

09:23.193 --> 09:25.596
MIKE, THAT WAS OKAY
WHEN SHE WAS ALIVE.

09:25.596 --> 09:28.098
NOW SHE'S A DEAD LADY
GIVING US REALLY COOL STUFF,

09:28.098 --> 09:31.071
SO A LITTLE RESPECT?
 OKAY. AS LONG AS IT WAS FREE.

09:31.071 --> 09:34.104
YEAH, UM, BUT AS FAR
AS GABY'S CONCERNED,

09:34.104 --> 09:35.906
IT COST 30 GRAND.

09:35.906 --> 09:38.148
WHAT? WHY?

09:38.148 --> 09:40.150
(sighs) WELL, I LOVE GABY,
BUT FOR YEARS,

09:40.150 --> 09:43.253
SHE HAS BEEN FLAUNTING HOW MUCH
THEY SPEND ON HER HOUSE

09:43.253 --> 09:45.355
AND HER CAR AND HER JEWELRY.

09:45.355 --> 09:47.357
AND THIS IS
MY TURN TO FLAUNT,

09:47.357 --> 09:49.589
AND I CAN'T FLAUNT
WITH A FREE PIANO.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.763
DON'T STOOP TO HER LEVEL.
YOU'RE BETTER THAN THAT.

09:52.763 --> 09:54.124
NO, I'M REALLY NOT.

09:54.124 --> 09:55.826
SUSAN, I'M NOT KIDDING.

09:55.826 --> 09:58.168
YOU'RE NOT TELLING GABY
WE PAID FOR THIS PIANO.

09:58.168 --> 10:00.170
OH, MIKE, PLEASE.
THIS IS MY CHANCE.

10:00.170 --> 10:02.102
MY AUNT HAD
A STROKE WHILE DRIVING!

10:02.102 --> 10:05.105
WHEN AM I EVER GONNA GET
THAT LUCKY AGAIN? (sighs)

10:05.105 --> 10:07.377
YOU'RE NOT
GONNA BELIEVE THIS.

10:07.377 --> 10:09.179
THEY'RE OUT OF CILANTRO.

10:09.179 --> 10:12.212
HOW CAN A MARKET
BE OUT OF CILANTRO?
 I DON'T KNOW,

10:12.212 --> 10:15.215
BUT I TOLD THAT CLERK SHE SHOULD
HANG HER HEAD IN SHAME.

10:15.215 --> 10:18.188
AS WELL YOU SHOULD.
SO WHAT ELSE DO WE NEED?

10:18.188 --> 10:20.190
LET'S HEAD OVER
TO THE KOSHER AISLE.

10:20.190 --> 10:22.723
I NEED A FEW ITEMS FOR
THE SCHWARTZMAN BAR MITZVAH.

10:28.058 --> 10:31.031
WE NEED BAKING SODA.
I'LL GET IT.

10:33.734 --> 10:35.666
OH. SAM?

10:37.838 --> 10:41.011
PLEASE. NOT NOW.
 WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU EVEN DOING HERE?

10:41.011 --> 10:43.343
I LOST MY JOB.
I HAD TO WORK SOMEPLACE.

10:46.917 --> 10:50.751
(chuckles) YOU ALREADY, UH,
GOT THE BAKING SODA.

10:50.751 --> 10:54.254
BOY, I WOULD LOSE MY HEAD
IF IT WASN'T SCREWED ON.

10:54.254 --> 10:56.286
WHO'S THAT WOMAN?

10:56.286 --> 10:59.089
NOBODY.
SOMEONE I USED TO KNOW.

10:59.089 --> 11:01.091
OH. IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

11:01.091 --> 11:04.865
I WAS... TELLING HER
THAT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE

11:04.865 --> 11:07.838
FOR A STORE THIS BIG
TO RUN OUT OF A MAJOR HERB.

11:07.838 --> 11:11.301
I THINK WE SHOULD CHECK OUT
HUDSON'S MARKET.
 THAT'S DOWNTOWN.

11:11.301 --> 11:14.004
WE NEED CILANTRO, DON'T WE?
COME ON.

11:25.315 --> 11:27.157
HEY.

11:27.157 --> 11:30.290
HEY.
OH, YOU BROUGHT ME FLOWERS.

11:30.290 --> 11:33.293
(chuckles)
 WELL, I WANTED TO GET YOU
A T-SHIRT THAT SAID,

11:33.293 --> 11:37.097
"I'M A MORON WHO WEARS DARK
CLOTHES WHEN I RUN AT NIGHT,"

11:37.097 --> 11:39.199
BUT THE GIFT SHOP WAS OUT.

11:39.199 --> 11:42.032
SO WHO DID THIS TO YOU?
DID YOU SEE 'EM?

11:42.032 --> 11:43.373
NO.

11:43.373 --> 11:47.237
DAMN. WHAT KIND OF PERSON HITS
YOU AND THEN JUST DRIVES AWAY?

11:47.237 --> 11:51.311
MAYBE THE KIND OF PERSON
WHO WANTED TO HIT ME.

11:53.183 --> 11:55.886
WAIT.
YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T SEE THEM.

11:55.886 --> 11:57.848
I DIDN'T, BUT, ANGE,
I'M TELLING YOU,

11:57.848 --> 12:00.190
THIS GUY--HE DRIVES PAST ME,

12:00.190 --> 12:03.723
HE TURNS AROUND
AND SWERVES RIGHT INTO ME.

12:06.056 --> 12:08.458
OH, MY GOD.
 WHERE'S DANNY?

12:08.458 --> 12:11.461
HE FELL ASLEEP IN THE WAITING
ROOM. WE'VE BEEN HERE ALL NIGHT.

12:11.461 --> 12:14.504
UH, YOU WANT ME TO GET HIM?
 NO, NO. LISTEN.
I NEED YOU GUYS TO GO HOME,

12:14.504 --> 12:16.506
GRAB THE I.D.s, SOME MONEY,

12:16.506 --> 12:19.069
WHATEVER YOU CAN STUFF
IN A COUPLE OF BAGS.

12:19.069 --> 12:22.472
BUT YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY
TRAVEL-READY, NICK.

12:22.472 --> 12:24.945
OH, ABSOLUTELY NOT.

12:24.945 --> 12:27.447
THE PLACE WE TALKED ABOUT,
NEAR CARBONDALE.

12:27.447 --> 12:30.280
JUST FOR A FEW WEEKS.

12:30.280 --> 12:32.382
NO. NOT WITHOUT YOU.

12:32.382 --> 12:34.785
(sighs)
 NO, I'LL SEND DANNY.

12:34.785 --> 12:37.087
BUT YOU AND ME--
THIS IS AS FAR AS WE RUN.

12:37.087 --> 12:40.490
WHAT IF IT IS PATRICK?
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

12:43.033 --> 12:45.796
WE'VE BEEN ASKING THAT QUESTION
FOR 20 YEARS.

12:47.838 --> 12:50.140
I GUESS NOW
WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT.

13:06.216 --> 13:08.288
CAN I TALK TO YOU A MINUTE?

13:10.090 --> 13:11.291
SURE.

13:13.023 --> 13:15.065
IT'S ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
WITH PORTER.

13:15.065 --> 13:17.327
ARE YOU MAD? YOU'RE MAD.

13:17.327 --> 13:19.229
NO, I'M NOT.

13:19.229 --> 13:21.932
YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE.

13:21.932 --> 13:24.134
NO. NO, I JUST WANT TO TALK.

13:24.134 --> 13:27.207
YOU LOOKED LIKE
YOU REALLY WANTED TO HURT HIM,

13:27.207 --> 13:30.210
AND I KIND OF NEED TO KNOW
WHAT THAT'S ABOUT.

13:30.210 --> 13:35.185
YOUR FAMILY DOESN'T SEEM TO
CARE HOW MUCH YOU HELP THEM.

13:35.185 --> 13:39.189
YOU'RE A GREAT MOM,
AND THEY JUST PUSH YOU AROUND.

13:39.189 --> 13:41.391
IT--IT MADE ME ANGRY.

13:41.391 --> 13:43.223
YES, I SAW THAT.

13:43.223 --> 13:47.197
AND SOMETIMES MY FAMILY
CAN BE UNAPPRECIATIVE.

13:51.902 --> 13:54.905
BUT WHAT HAPPENED TODAY
CAN NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

13:54.905 --> 13:56.937
I KNOW.

13:56.937 --> 14:00.941
LISTEN, I GREW UP
WITH AN ALCOHOLIC MOTHER.

14:03.273 --> 14:07.177
I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE
TO BE ANGRY ALL THE TIME.

14:07.177 --> 14:12.252
BUT WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE,
I HAD TO FIND A WAY...

14:12.252 --> 14:14.454
(sighs and chuckles)

14:14.454 --> 14:17.087
TO CONTROL MYSELF.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.360
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

14:23.093 --> 14:24.394
A LOT OF HELP.

14:24.394 --> 14:27.067
ONE THING--I HAD
A GREAT COUNSELOR AT SCHOOL,

14:27.067 --> 14:28.638
AND SHE TAUGHT ME

14:28.638 --> 14:32.042
THAT WHENEVER I WAS
ABOUT TO LOSE IT,

14:32.042 --> 14:34.004
THAT I SHOULD DO THIS...

14:34.004 --> 14:37.207
(inhales and exhales deeply)
ONE.

14:37.207 --> 14:39.479
(exhales) TWO.

14:39.479 --> 14:41.251
(exhales) THREE.

14:41.251 --> 14:43.453
THAT REALLY WORKS?

14:43.453 --> 14:45.585
IT REALLY DOES.

14:47.958 --> 14:49.960
IT GIVES YOU A CHANCE

14:49.960 --> 14:52.092
TO STEP BACK,

14:52.092 --> 14:54.424
FEEL LIKE YOU'RE IN CONTROL.

14:54.424 --> 14:57.097
YOU SHOULD TRY IT NEXT TIME.
YOU'LL SEE.

14:57.097 --> 14:59.669
OKAY.

15:03.203 --> 15:05.135
MM.

15:07.507 --> 15:10.340
I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT WHAT I DID.

15:10.340 --> 15:12.682
IT'S FINE.

15:12.682 --> 15:15.285
JUST DON'T EVER DO IT AGAIN.

15:18.388 --> 15:21.691
BUT THANK YOU FOR WANTING TO.

15:21.691 --> 15:23.253
(chuckles)

15:31.701 --> 15:35.065
OH, COME ON, LARRY.
YOU'RE MY BUSINESS MANAGER, TOO.

15:35.065 --> 15:37.307
I AM NOT LEAVING THIS OFFICE
UNTIL YOU TELL ME

15:37.307 --> 15:39.939
WHAT CARLOS IS DOING
WITH MY SKI HOUSE MONEY.

15:39.939 --> 15:43.073
(sighs) GABY, YOU'RE PUTTING ME
IN AN UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION.

15:43.073 --> 15:46.646
YOU SHOULD TALK TO CARLOS.
 I DID!
I OFFERED TO PUT MYSELF

15:46.646 --> 15:50.250
IN A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE
POSITION, AND HE STILL SAID NO.

15:50.250 --> 15:54.484
I'M SORRY, BUT CARLOS SWORE ME
TO SECRECY. PLEASE RESPECT THAT.

15:54.484 --> 15:56.326
YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M SORRY.

15:56.326 --> 15:58.058
NO HARD FEELINGS.

15:58.058 --> 15:59.329
OF COURSE NOT.

15:59.329 --> 16:02.032
HEY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:02.032 --> 16:04.034
HMM.
I DON'T WANT TO BE A LIAR.

16:04.034 --> 16:07.037
WHEN I GO HOME, AND I'M IN TEARS
AND CARLOS ASKS ME WHY,

16:07.037 --> 16:11.201
AND I SAY YOU GRABBED MY ASS,
I WANT TO BE TELLING THE TRUTH.

16:11.201 --> 16:14.244
WELL PLAYED.

16:14.244 --> 16:17.407
CARLOS GAVE $50,000
TO ONE OF YOUR NEIGHBORS.

16:17.407 --> 16:20.110
WHAT?! WHO?!

16:20.110 --> 16:23.113
A MIKE DELFINO. APPARENTLY,
HIS BUSINESS IS IN BIG TROUBLE.

16:23.113 --> 16:26.116
OH, MY GOD. MIKE'S WIFE IS
ONE OF MY CLOSEST FRIENDS,

16:26.116 --> 16:28.388
AND SHE NEVER SAID A WORD.

16:28.388 --> 16:29.989
POOR THING.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.422
PLEASE DON'T TELL CARLOS
I TOLD YOU.

16:32.422 --> 16:34.564
OF COURSE.

16:34.564 --> 16:36.266
I SHOULD GET GOING.

16:36.266 --> 16:38.268
DO YOU HAVE
PARKING VALIDATION?

16:38.268 --> 16:42.102
OH, THOSE ARE ONLY
FOR EMPLOYEES.

16:42.102 --> 16:44.274
OKAY, YOU COULD TAKE MINE.

16:46.136 --> 16:49.008
HOTEL, FOOD, INCIDENTALS--

16:49.008 --> 16:50.410
$300.

16:50.410 --> 16:52.412
YOU CAN ORDER PAY PER VIEW.

16:52.412 --> 16:54.384
I DON'T EVEN CARE
IF YOU BUY BEER.

16:54.384 --> 16:57.147
JUST STAY IN YOUR ROOM
AS MUCH AS YOU CAN, OKAY?

16:57.147 --> 16:59.589
THIS IS STUPID.
IT'S BEEN 20 YEARS.

16:59.589 --> 17:03.623
HAVE YOU ACTUALLY SEEN OR HEARD
FROM THIS PATRICK LOGAN GUY?

17:03.623 --> 17:08.098
DO YOU KNOW FOR A FACT
THAT HE'S EVEN STILL ALIVE?
 DANNY, I'M NOT GONNA
DEBATE THIS WITH YOU.

17:08.098 --> 17:10.500
IF HE STARTED THIS GROUP
YOU GUYS WERE IN,

17:10.500 --> 17:12.502
THEN ISN'T HE ON THE RUN,
TOO?

17:12.502 --> 17:15.505
HE'S GOT BIGGER PROBLEMS
THAN GETTING REVENGE.
 JUST HUMOR ME, OKAY?

17:15.505 --> 17:18.208
BECAUSE IF I'M WRONG,
ALL I AM IS WRONG.

17:18.208 --> 17:20.170
BUT IF I'M NOT...

17:22.212 --> 17:26.045
PLEASE. JUST HUMOR ME.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.053
(man)
CHECK STAND ONE IS NOW OPEN.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.385
HELLO.

17:35.385 --> 17:37.387
CHECK STAND ONE IS NOW OPEN,
TAKING ALL CUSTOMERS...

17:37.387 --> 17:39.058
HELLO.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.161
UM, I SAW YOU THE OTHER DAY,

17:41.161 --> 17:44.063
TALKING TO MY FRIEND SAM.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.436
OH, I'M--I'M BREE,
BY THE WAY.

17:46.436 --> 17:48.438
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

17:48.438 --> 17:49.769
OH.

17:51.271 --> 17:53.573
WELL, THIS IS
NONE OF MY BUSINESS,

17:53.573 --> 17:59.379
BUT I NOTICED THAT THERE WAS
SOME TENSION BETWEEN YOU TWO.

17:59.379 --> 18:01.411
YOU COULD SAY THAT.

18:01.411 --> 18:05.555
OH. WELL,
I HOPE EVERYTHING IS OKAY.

18:05.555 --> 18:08.718
WHAT IS IT YOU WANT?

18:11.191 --> 18:12.492
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

18:12.492 --> 18:17.197
THERE WAS JUST SOMETHING SO ODD
ABOUT THAT... ENCOUNTER.

18:17.197 --> 18:20.670
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY HE WOULD
TALK TO A FRIEND LIKE THAT.

18:24.334 --> 18:27.277
MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE
I'M NOT HIS FRIEND.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.540
I'M HIS MOTHER.

18:45.495 --> 18:49.229
MY MANAGER SAID I COULD
TAKE A BREAK EARLY.

18:49.229 --> 18:51.261
YOU'VE GOT FIVE MINUTES.

18:51.261 --> 18:53.333
ARE YOU AWARE

18:53.333 --> 18:55.905
THAT SAM GOES AROUND
TELLING PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE--

18:55.905 --> 18:58.608
DEAD.

18:58.608 --> 19:00.310
YES, I HEARD.

19:00.310 --> 19:02.212
WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?

19:05.144 --> 19:07.177
HE'S A COMPLICATED BOY.

19:09.719 --> 19:12.352
(sighs)

19:12.352 --> 19:15.585
DID SAM TELL YOU
WHO HIS FATHER WAS?

19:15.585 --> 19:19.329
HE TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR
RELATIONSHIP WITH MY... HUSBAND,

19:19.329 --> 19:22.492
IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO.

19:22.492 --> 19:26.836
DID HE ALSO MENTION THE LETTER
THAT REX SENT TO ME?

19:26.836 --> 19:28.738
WHAT LETTER?

19:28.738 --> 19:30.740
IT WAS
AFTER YOU WERE MARRIED.

19:30.740 --> 19:32.742
REX HAD JUST STARTED
HIS PRACTICE,

19:32.742 --> 19:36.506
AND APPARENTLY,
THE MONEY WAS POURING IN.

19:38.248 --> 19:39.909
REX WROTE

19:39.909 --> 19:44.554
AND TOLD ME HE COULD GIVE SAM
A BETTER LIFE.

19:44.554 --> 19:46.956
HE THEN ASKED
FOR FULL-TIME CUSTODY.

19:50.390 --> 19:53.192
I'M GUESSING
HE NEVER TOLD YOU THAT.

19:53.192 --> 19:57.196
MUST HAVE SLIPPED HIS MIND.

19:57.196 --> 20:00.199
I POLITELY DECLINED
HIS OFFER.

20:00.199 --> 20:03.873
AND DID SAM...
KNOW ABOUT THIS?

20:03.873 --> 20:06.306
NOT UNTIL A FEW MONTHS AGO,

20:06.306 --> 20:08.908
WHEN HE FOUND THE LETTER.

20:08.908 --> 20:12.842
AND WHEN HE REALIZED THAT HE
COULD HAVE LIVED ALL THOSE YEARS

20:12.842 --> 20:17.247
WITH HIS DAD
IN A FANCY HOUSE...

20:17.247 --> 20:21.291
HE... WAS BEYOND LIVID.

20:21.291 --> 20:26.296
EVEN SO, HOW COULD HE GO AROUND
PRETENDING THAT YOU'RE DEAD?

20:28.298 --> 20:30.800
LIKE I SAID...

20:30.800 --> 20:33.333
HE'S A COMPLICATED BOY.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.711
GABY, HI.

20:41.711 --> 20:44.344
HI, SUSAN.

20:44.344 --> 20:46.346
I JUST GOT BACK
FROM THE SUPERMARKET

20:46.346 --> 20:48.378
AND REALIZED I BOUGHT
WAY TOO MUCH.

20:48.378 --> 20:50.350
I'M AFRAID
SOME OF IT'S GONNA GO BAD,

20:50.350 --> 20:52.352
AND SO I THOUGHT,
WHO COULD I GIVE THIS TO?

20:52.352 --> 20:55.285
AND I RANDOMLY THOUGHT OF YOU.
(chuckles)

20:56.956 --> 20:58.958
YOU'RE AFRAID
THAT CANNED PEACHES

20:58.958 --> 21:01.631
AND CONDENSED MILK
ARE GOING TO GO BAD?

21:01.631 --> 21:05.264
WELL, IT'S JUST,
MY CUPBOARDS ARE CLUTTERED,

21:05.264 --> 21:08.398
AND YOU'D BE
DOING ME A HUGE FAVOR.

21:08.398 --> 21:09.899
OKAY. (chuckles)

21:09.899 --> 21:10.940
THANKS.

21:10.940 --> 21:12.842
OH. HEY.

21:12.842 --> 21:14.944
AS LONG AS YOU'RE HERE,

21:14.944 --> 21:17.307
I WANT TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHING.

21:20.650 --> 21:22.652
(door closes)
 WOW.

21:22.652 --> 21:24.454
WE JUST GOT IT.

21:24.454 --> 21:27.357
M.J. IS GONNA TAKE LESSONS.

21:27.357 --> 21:28.418
(chuckles)

21:28.418 --> 21:30.920
YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
TO START HIM OFF

21:30.920 --> 21:33.323
WITH, SAY, A USED UPRIGHT?

21:33.323 --> 21:34.824
NO WAY.

21:34.824 --> 21:38.398
ME WAN-NY, ME LIKE-Y,
ME GET-TY.
 (keys play)

21:38.398 --> 21:39.969
(chuckles)

21:39.969 --> 21:44.073
MAY I ASK HOW MUCH THIS COST-Y?

21:44.073 --> 21:48.508
WELL, MIKE DOESN'T LIKE
ME THROWING AROUND NUMBERS,

21:48.508 --> 21:52.482
BUT LET'S JUST SAY
YOUR JAW WOULD DROP...

21:52.482 --> 21:54.644
(whispers) 30,000 TIMES.

21:54.644 --> 21:56.045
WHA--

21:56.045 --> 21:58.518
THAT'S ONE.

21:58.518 --> 22:00.950
THIS IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS,

22:00.950 --> 22:03.953
BUT IS THIS
REALLY THE BEST TIME

22:03.953 --> 22:06.095
TO BUY SOMETHING
THIS EXPENSIVE?

22:06.095 --> 22:09.499
I MEAN, DIDN'T MIKE JUST HAVE
HIS TRUCK REPOSSESSED?

22:09.499 --> 22:12.832
THINGS FINALLY
TURNED AROUND.

22:12.832 --> 22:15.104
HE GOT A BIG CASH INFUSION.

22:15.104 --> 22:17.367
YOU DON'T SAY.

22:17.367 --> 22:20.970
ANYWAY, I KNOW YOU GUYS
 DON'T HAVE A PIANO,

22:20.970 --> 22:24.073
SO IF YOU EVER WANT THE GIRLS
TO TAKE LESSONS...

22:26.376 --> 22:28.047
WELL, THANK YOU.
I GOTTA GO.

22:28.047 --> 22:29.779
ENJOY YOUR PEACHES.

22:32.552 --> 22:34.424
(kisses)

22:36.426 --> 22:39.088
YOU OWE ME $50,000.

22:39.088 --> 22:41.030
WHAT?
 FOR YOUR INFORMATION,

22:41.030 --> 22:44.664
MIKE'S "BIG CASH INFUSION"
COST ME MY SKI HOUSE.

22:44.664 --> 22:46.666
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

22:46.666 --> 22:48.367
OH, DON'T PLAY DUMB.

22:48.367 --> 22:51.140
CARLOS LOANED MIKE THE 50 GRAND,
AND YOU KNOW IT!

22:52.672 --> 22:55.044
WHY ARE YOU LOOKING
LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW IT?

22:55.044 --> 22:58.107
HE TOLD ME...

22:58.107 --> 22:59.779
BUSINESS PICKED UP.

22:59.779 --> 23:01.150
WELL, HE LIED,

23:01.150 --> 23:03.853
JUST LIKE CARLOS LIED TO ME
ABOUT WHERE OUR MONEY WENT,

23:03.853 --> 23:06.155
WHICH YOU WENT
AND SPENT ON A PIANO.

23:06.155 --> 23:09.018
OH, NO--NO, I DIDN'T. UH...

23:10.520 --> 23:12.692
I INHERITED IT.

23:12.692 --> 23:14.864
I WAS TRYING
TO MAKE YOU JEALOUS.

23:14.864 --> 23:16.866
OH, HONEY,

23:16.866 --> 23:20.600
GIVEN DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES,
THAT SO WOULD HAVE WORKED.

23:22.932 --> 23:25.404
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

23:25.404 --> 23:28.037
I HAVE THE MONEY
FROM THE STRIP CLUB

23:28.037 --> 23:29.539
SITTING IN THE BANK,

23:29.539 --> 23:32.912
AND MIKE WOULD RATHER
BORROW IT FROM YOU GUYS?

23:35.184 --> 23:37.416
I'M ABOUT TO SCREECH
AT MY HUSBAND.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.418
YOU MIGHT WANT TO STAND BACK.
 (beep)

23:39.418 --> 23:41.420
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

23:41.420 --> 23:44.694
I HAVE A BETTER IDEA.

23:44.694 --> 23:46.926
THERE YOU ARE.

23:46.926 --> 23:48.828
HEY.

23:48.828 --> 23:51.430
HEY, MR. SCAVO.
 HOW WAS THE FLIGHT?

23:51.430 --> 23:53.603
HORRIBLE. IT WAS DELAYED,

23:53.603 --> 23:55.104
THERE WAS TURBULENCE,

23:55.104 --> 23:57.136
THEY RAN OUT OF FOOD,

23:57.136 --> 24:01.911
AND I'M NOT SEEING A PLATE
COVERED WITH TINFOIL HERE.

24:01.911 --> 24:06.145
THERE WAS ONE, BUT ONE OF OUR 50
CHILDREN MUST HAVE INHALED IT.
 (sighs) DAMN IT!

24:06.145 --> 24:07.847
OKAY, CALM DOWN.

24:07.847 --> 24:10.720
LYNETTE, NO. I'M HUNGRY.
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU WERE WORKING,

24:10.720 --> 24:13.723
I ALWAYS HAD FOOD WAITING
FOR YOU.
 OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

24:13.723 --> 24:16.786
YOU WERE VERY CONSIDERATE
IN YOUR EIGHTH MONTH.
 I'M SORRY. I KEEP FORGETTING,

24:16.786 --> 24:19.929
YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON
WHO'S EVER BEEN PREGNANT BEFORE.

24:19.929 --> 24:22.061
RELAX. RELAX.
WE'LL JUST ORDER A PIZZA.

24:22.061 --> 24:25.535
AND WAIT AN HOUR? FORGET IT.
I'LL FEND FOR MYSELF.

24:25.535 --> 24:27.196
(under breath) SIX, SEVEN,

24:27.196 --> 24:29.198
EIGHT, NINE...

24:29.198 --> 24:32.001
HEY, IT'S OKAY. I'M FINE.

24:32.001 --> 24:34.203
THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE.

24:34.203 --> 24:37.707
COME ON. LYNETTE, YOU DIDN'T GO
TO THE STORE TODAY?
 16... 17...

24:37.707 --> 24:41.210
SWEETIE, YOU MIGHT WANT
TO TAKE IT DOWN A NOTCH.
 I HAVE BEEN IN THREE CITIES
IN TWO DAYS.

24:41.210 --> 24:44.784
YOU'D THINK YOU'D FIND THE TIME
TO GO TO THE MARKET.
 21, 22...

24:44.784 --> 24:47.116
WHAT THE HELL IS HE DOING?

24:47.116 --> 24:48.858
EDDIE, IT'S OKAY.

24:48.858 --> 24:51.120
23, 24, 25...
 TELL HIM
TO STICK A SOCK IN IT.

24:51.120 --> 24:52.592
26, 27...

24:52.592 --> 24:54.764
OKAY, YOU NEED TO KISS ME.
HERE. MMM!

24:54.764 --> 24:57.567
OKAY, THERE. WE'RE GOOD.
WE'RE GOOD. HE LOVES ME.

24:57.567 --> 25:00.269
(makes kissing sounds)
HE LOVES ME.
 (pants)

25:00.269 --> 25:03.002
(makes kissing sounds,
laughs)

25:03.002 --> 25:05.234
(sighs)

25:05.234 --> 25:07.276
(whispers)
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT LATER.

25:18.648 --> 25:20.990
SO EDDIE ATTACKED OUR SON?

25:20.990 --> 25:23.122
OKAY, I'D USE "ATTACK,"
BUT WITH A SMALL "A."

25:23.122 --> 25:27.096
OKAY, THAT'S IT. I WANT HIM OUT,
AND THAT'S WITH A BIG "O."

25:27.096 --> 25:30.229
LOOK, EDDIE IS NOT SOME
EXCHANGE STUDENT FROM FRANCE.

25:30.229 --> 25:32.231
HE COMES
FROM AN ABUSIVE HOME.

25:32.231 --> 25:36.135
WE HAVE TO ACCEPT
HE HAS SOME... BAGGAGE.

25:36.135 --> 25:39.138
SO I HAVE TO WONDER
IF HE'S GONNA PUNCH ME

25:39.138 --> 25:41.841
ANY TIME I RAISE MY VOICE
TO YOU?

25:41.841 --> 25:46.976
I AM NOT SENDING HIM BACK
TO LIVE WITH THAT WOMAN, TOM.

25:46.976 --> 25:49.248
HOW ABOUT THERAPY?
THAT MIGHT HELP.

25:49.248 --> 25:51.280
NOW WE'RE GONNA PAY
FOR HIS THERAPY?

25:51.280 --> 25:54.283
OKAY, HERE'S A THOUGHT. HOW
ABOUT WE ALL STOP YELLING AT ME?

25:54.283 --> 25:56.756
WHAT A CONCEPT--
BE NICE TO LYNETTE.

25:56.756 --> 25:59.088
FINE.

25:59.088 --> 26:00.830
WE'LL TRY THE THERAPY.

26:02.061 --> 26:04.093
ALL THESE WEEKS,
SAM HAS BEEN GOING ON

26:04.093 --> 26:07.096
ABOUT HOW HIS MOTHER WAS DEAD,
AND THE WHOLE TIME,

26:07.096 --> 26:11.000
SHE HAS BEEN AT HOWE'S MARKET,
IN A SMOCK, STACKING CANS.

26:11.000 --> 26:14.844
I GUESS MY INSTINCTS ABOUT SAM
WERE RIGHT, WOULDN'T YOU SAY?

26:14.844 --> 26:17.046
WHAT DID I SAY
ABOUT GLOATING?

26:17.046 --> 26:19.178
SOMETHING.
I WASN'T LISTENING.

26:19.178 --> 26:21.751
I WAS THINKING
ABOUT HOW RIGHT I WAS.

26:21.751 --> 26:23.112
(snips)

26:23.112 --> 26:25.254
OKAY, I'LL STOP.
I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET.

26:25.254 --> 26:27.216
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

26:27.216 --> 26:29.218
WHEN SAM FIRST SHOWED UP,

26:29.218 --> 26:31.721
I FELT LIKE I GOT
A LITTLE PIECE OF REX BACK.

26:31.721 --> 26:33.863
IT WAS WONDERFUL.

26:33.863 --> 26:36.095
BUT THIS HAS FORCED ME
TO REMEMBER

26:36.095 --> 26:38.197
THAT REX WAS A LIAR, TOO.

26:46.305 --> 26:49.208
SORRY.
AM I INTERRUPTING SOMETHING?

26:51.881 --> 26:53.913
ORSON,
WOULD YOU PLEASE EXCUSE US?

26:53.913 --> 26:55.314
OF COURSE.

26:59.919 --> 27:01.791
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

27:01.791 --> 27:03.122
ACTUALLY, SAM--

27:03.122 --> 27:05.695
WAIT, WAIT. STILL HERE.

27:08.627 --> 27:11.200
I WENT BACK
TO THE SUPERMARKET TODAY.

27:14.934 --> 27:16.135
OH.

27:16.135 --> 27:18.167
(clicks pen)

27:18.167 --> 27:20.639
I TAKE IT YOU MET MY MOTHER.

27:20.639 --> 27:24.313
WHY DID YOU SAY
SHE WAS DEAD?

27:24.313 --> 27:27.116
SHE IS DEAD... TO ME.

27:27.116 --> 27:29.779
SO YOU ADMIT THAT YOU LIED?

27:31.320 --> 27:34.954
DID SHE TELL YOU I FOUND
A LETTER MY FATHER WROTE,

27:34.954 --> 27:39.128
BEGGING HER TO LET ME
COME LIVE WITH HIM?
 THAT'S HARDLY AN EXCUSE.

27:39.128 --> 27:40.830
I WAS 4.

27:40.830 --> 27:43.332
HE SAID HE COULD GIVE ME
ALL THE ADVANTAGES SHE COULDN'T,

27:43.332 --> 27:45.334
BUT SHE WOULDN'T LET HIM.

27:45.334 --> 27:49.268
SHE LOVED YOU.
SHE WANTED YOU BY HER SIDE--
 SHE SHOULD HAVE WANTED MORE
FOR ME!

27:49.268 --> 27:52.201
ANDREW GOT BICYCLES
FOR CHRISTMAS

27:52.201 --> 27:54.203
AND TVs FOR HIS BIRTHDAY.

27:54.203 --> 27:57.206
I HAD TO SIT IN A TRAILER AND DO
MY HOMEWORK WITH MITTENS ON

27:57.206 --> 28:00.179
BECAUSE MY MOM COULDN'T AFFORD
TO PAY THE HEATING BILL.

28:00.179 --> 28:02.782
IF SHE HAD LOVED ME,
SHE WOULD HAVE LET ME

28:02.782 --> 28:05.014
LIVE THE LIFE
THAT I WAS ENTITLED TO!

28:08.918 --> 28:10.790
(exhales deeply)

28:12.691 --> 28:14.063
I'M...

28:14.063 --> 28:16.295
GOING TO... (sniffles)

28:16.295 --> 28:20.069
TALK TO THE... SCHWARTZMANS
ABOUT THEIR BAR MITZVAH.

28:20.069 --> 28:24.033
IF YOU WANT TO GO OVER
THE MENU LATER, LET ME KNOW.

28:31.380 --> 28:33.182
OH.

28:33.182 --> 28:34.713
HEY!

28:34.713 --> 28:36.415
HOW'D IT GO?

28:36.415 --> 28:38.948
KIND OF WEIRD,
BUT IT WAS OKAY.
 YEAH?

28:38.948 --> 28:41.290
I THINK YOU DID
VERY GOOD WORK TODAY, EDDIE.

28:41.290 --> 28:43.292
NOW THE RESTROOM IS
DOWN THE HALL,

28:43.292 --> 28:46.055
SECOND DOOR ON THE RIGHT.
 I'LL BE HERE.

28:46.055 --> 28:49.258
SO YOU SAID "GOOD WORK."
DOES THAT MEAN IT WENT WELL?

28:49.258 --> 28:53.102
THAT MEANS
EDDIE'S GOT SOME ISSUES,

28:53.102 --> 28:56.906
AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME
TO WORK THROUGH THEM.

28:56.906 --> 28:59.208
OKAY... HOW MUCH MORE TIME

28:59.208 --> 29:00.970
AT $130 AN HOUR?

29:00.970 --> 29:02.972
WELL,
IT WOULD GO A LOT FASTER

29:02.972 --> 29:05.314
IF WE COULD GET HIS MOTHER
IN HERE,

29:05.314 --> 29:08.848
BUT HE SEEMS TO THINK THERE'S
NO WAY SHE'D AGREE TO THAT.

29:08.848 --> 29:12.281
REALLY? IF YOU THINK IT'LL HELP,
I CAN GET HER IN HERE.

29:12.281 --> 29:14.954
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

29:14.954 --> 29:16.956
OKAY, AND THEN...

29:16.956 --> 29:19.829
AND THEN EVERYTHING
WILL BE OKAY, RIGHT?

29:19.829 --> 29:23.292
LET'S JUST GET THE MOTHER
IN HERE.

29:26.035 --> 29:28.097
(door closes)

29:32.842 --> 29:35.304
(doorbell rings)

29:37.907 --> 29:39.248
BARBARA?

29:39.248 --> 29:42.081
IT'S LYNETTE SCAVO.

29:49.318 --> 29:52.361
BARBARA,
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT EDDIE.

30:03.272 --> 30:04.303
HEY.

30:04.303 --> 30:07.036
ARE YOU LOOKING
FOR BARBARA ORLOFSKY?

30:07.036 --> 30:09.839
YEAH.
DO YOU KNOW WHERE SHE IS?

30:09.839 --> 30:12.842
NO. NOBODY'S SEEN HER FOR DAYS,
AND HER CAR'S STILL THERE.

30:12.842 --> 30:14.313
IT'S WEIRD.

30:21.050 --> 30:22.421
(door creaks)

30:22.421 --> 30:24.453
HEY.

30:24.453 --> 30:25.925
(sighs)

30:25.925 --> 30:27.927
THERE'S THIS CRAZY RUMOR
GOING AROUND

30:27.927 --> 30:30.159
THAT YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING
FOR ME.

30:30.159 --> 30:33.162
JUST AN APOLOGY.

30:33.162 --> 30:36.835
WELL, AS LONG AS IT COMES
WITH ONE OF YOUR MUFFINS,

30:36.835 --> 30:38.837
I MAY JUST ACCEPT IT.

30:38.837 --> 30:41.240
OH, ANDREW.

30:41.240 --> 30:44.043
MM.

30:44.043 --> 30:46.215
ORSON TOLD ME ABOUT SAM.

30:46.215 --> 30:49.919
YOU WERE RIGHT FROM THE START.
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE TRUSTED HIM.

30:49.919 --> 30:51.280
WOW.

30:51.280 --> 30:54.984
I-I DON'T EVEN NEED
THE MUFFIN NOW.

30:54.984 --> 30:59.058
NOW THAT THAT'S SETTLED,
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO ABOUT SAM?

30:59.058 --> 31:01.260
THAT'S EASY.
WE GET RID OF HIM.

31:01.260 --> 31:03.963
I DON'T THINK
IT'S GONNA BE THAT SIMPLE.

31:03.963 --> 31:05.895
WHY NOT?

31:05.895 --> 31:09.598
I SAW A SIDE TO HIM LAST NIGHT
THAT I'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE,

31:09.598 --> 31:14.543
AND TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST...

31:14.543 --> 31:18.047
(whispers) I'M AFRAID OF HIM.

31:26.385 --> 31:29.118
HI, SUSAN! THANKS FOR HAVING US
OVER FOR DINNER.

31:29.118 --> 31:31.560
OH, WELL, ACTUALLY,
DINNER WAS JUST AN EXCUSE.

31:31.560 --> 31:36.395
I WANTED TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHING.
 (gasps) OH, MY GOD!
YOU BOUGHT A PIANO?

31:36.395 --> 31:39.898
YES! AND I WANTED YOU
 TO BE THE FIRST TO SEE IT.

31:39.898 --> 31:42.671
WOW. THAT LOOKS... PRICEY.
 MM-HMM.

31:42.671 --> 31:44.433
$30,000,

31:44.433 --> 31:48.377
PLUS DELIVERY AND TAX
AND A BIANNUAL TUNING FEE.

31:48.377 --> 31:50.409
BUT MIKE'S ON HIS WAY DOWN.

31:50.409 --> 31:54.543
DO ME A FAVOR. DON'T LET ON
THAT YOU KNOW HOW MUCH IT COST.
 WHY NOT?

31:54.543 --> 31:57.246
HE THINKS IT'S OSTENTATIOUS,
AND HE'S A LITTLE EMBARRASSED.

31:57.246 --> 31:59.248
IN FACT,
HE KEEPS TELLING EVERYONE

31:59.248 --> 32:02.651
THAT I INHERITED IT FROM
MY AUNT, SO JUST GO WITH IT.

32:02.651 --> 32:06.325
HEY, GUYS. SORRY I'M LATE.
 THAT'S OKAY, HONEY.
I'M GONNA CHECK ON DINNER.

32:06.325 --> 32:08.327
WE'RE GONNA CHECK ON DINNER.

32:10.359 --> 32:13.462
DUDE, WE NEED TO TALK.
A PIANO?

32:13.462 --> 32:15.534
OH, GOD, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
WE DIDN'T BUY IT.

32:15.534 --> 32:18.007
SUSAN INHERITED IT
FROM HER DEAD AUNT.

32:19.438 --> 32:22.471
WOW. WITHOUT EVEN BLINKING.

32:22.471 --> 32:25.414
UH, WOULD ANYONE MIND
HELPING ME SET THE TABLE?

32:25.414 --> 32:27.676
OH, CARLOS WILL DO IT.

32:27.676 --> 32:31.020
OH, GREAT. AND, MIKE, MAYBE YOU
AND GABY CAN GET THE WINE.

32:32.581 --> 32:35.484
SO YOU AND CARLOS HAVE
ANY BIG PLANS FOR THE SUMMER?

32:35.484 --> 32:37.186
YOU TAKING ANY TRIPS?

32:37.186 --> 32:41.230
(crying)

32:41.230 --> 32:42.261
GABY?

32:42.261 --> 32:44.994
(sobs)

32:44.994 --> 32:48.067
OH, I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.

32:48.067 --> 32:50.539
LOOK, IF, UM,
YOU NEED TO TALK...

32:50.539 --> 32:52.541
SUSAN'S IN THE OTHER ROOM.
(chuckles)

32:52.541 --> 32:55.974
I THINK CARLOS IS
HAVING AN AFFAIR.

32:55.974 --> 32:58.507
WHAT?
WHY WOULD YOU THINK THAT?

32:58.507 --> 33:01.210
BECAUSE HE'S BEEN ACTING
REALLY SECRETIVE LATELY.

33:01.210 --> 33:03.482
AND I WENT TO TALK
TO OUR BUSINESS MANAGER,

33:03.482 --> 33:06.215
AND I DISCOVERED $50,000 WAS
MISSING FROM OUR ACCOUNT.

33:06.215 --> 33:09.458
WELL, I'M SURE
THERE'S A GOOD EXPLANATION.

33:09.458 --> 33:11.460
(cork pops)
 YEAH, THERE IS.

33:11.460 --> 33:14.593
IT'S CALLED FANCY DRESSES
AND HOTEL ROOMS FOR SOME BIMBO.

33:14.593 --> 33:17.426
NO, NO, NO. I AM SURE THAT
YOU'VE GOT THAT ALL WRONG.

33:17.426 --> 33:19.028
(chuckles)

33:19.028 --> 33:21.100
WAIT A MINUTE.
ARE YOU COVERING FOR HIM?

33:21.100 --> 33:25.134
NO. I...
 BECAUSE I STOLE HIS CELL PHONE
TO SEE WHO HE WAS TALKING TO,

33:25.134 --> 33:27.436
AND HE CALLED YOUR HOUSE,
LIKE, A HUNDRED TIMES.

33:27.436 --> 33:30.339
WELL,
HE HASN'T BEEN TALKING TO ME.

33:30.339 --> 33:33.412
REALLY? WELL, THE NEXT TIME
HE'S NOT TALKING TO YOU,

33:33.412 --> 33:38.047
YOU MIGHT WANT TO GIVE HIM
THE NAME OF YOUR DIVORCE LAWYER.

33:38.047 --> 33:40.249
I'M SO GLAD YOU GUYS
WERE FREE TONIGHT.

33:40.249 --> 33:43.452
WE'VE BEEN WANTING TO DO THIS
FOR SUCH A LONG--OH, MY GOD!
 WHAT'S WRONG?

33:43.452 --> 33:46.455
MY EARRING. IT'S MISSING.
DAMN IT!

33:46.455 --> 33:50.129
I JUST GOT THEM TODAY.
 OH, I'M SURE IT'S SOMEWHERE.

33:50.129 --> 33:52.261
OH! HERE IT IS. (chuckles)

33:52.261 --> 33:55.734
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
3 GRAND OUT THE WINDOW.

33:55.734 --> 33:58.237
YOU BOUGHT $3,000 EARRINGS?

33:58.237 --> 34:00.339
OH, OF COURSE NOT.

34:00.339 --> 34:03.272
MIKE DID. HE'S SO GENEROUS,

34:03.272 --> 34:05.514
ESPECIALLY NOW
THAT WE'RE LOADED AGAIN.

34:05.514 --> 34:07.716
(chuckles)

34:07.716 --> 34:10.748
YOU KNOW, CARLOS,
I NEVER NOTICED BEFORE--

34:10.748 --> 34:13.722
YOU HAVE
A REALLY VEINY FOREHEAD.

34:17.755 --> 34:21.290
HEY, BUDDY,
WE GOT A BIT OF A PROBLEM.
 NO KIDDING.

34:21.290 --> 34:23.692
WAIT, YOU KNOW?
DID GABY SAY SOMETHING?

34:23.692 --> 34:26.695
NO. I HEARD IT ALL FROM SUSAN.
 HUH. WELL,
IT'S NOT SURPRISING,

34:26.695 --> 34:29.338
THE WAY THOSE TWO TALK,
BUT LUCKILY, IT'S NOT TRUE.

34:29.338 --> 34:31.340
COME ON, MIKE.
LET'S STOP THE LIES.

34:31.340 --> 34:33.772
IT IS TRUE,
AND WE BOTH KNOW IT.
 IT IS?

34:33.772 --> 34:36.775
DON'T ACT SURPRISED. GOD,
THIS WHOLE THING WAS A MISTAKE.

34:36.775 --> 34:40.708
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE
WRITTEN THAT CHECK.
 YOU PAID FOR IT? OH, MAN.

34:40.708 --> 34:43.482
WH--
 (Susan) DINNER IS READY.

34:43.482 --> 34:46.185
MMM! SUSAN,
EVERYTHING SMELLS SO GOOD.

34:46.185 --> 34:49.118
THANKS.

34:49.118 --> 34:51.120
YOU WANT SOME MEATBALLS,
CARLOS?

34:51.120 --> 34:54.193
I'VE GOT TWO NICE, BIG ONES
FOR YOU RIGHT HERE.

34:54.193 --> 34:56.324
NOPE. I'M FINE.

34:56.324 --> 34:59.328
I SAW THAT.

34:59.328 --> 35:00.829
SAW WHAT?

35:00.829 --> 35:03.372
YOU LEERING
AT SUSAN'S BREASTS.

35:04.673 --> 35:06.675
(chuckles) I WAS LOOKING
AT THE PASTA.

35:06.675 --> 35:09.338
SUSAN'S BREASTS JUST HAPPENED
TO BE HOVERING NEARBY.
 (chuckles)

35:09.338 --> 35:11.340
GABY, LEAVE CARLOS ALONE.

35:11.340 --> 35:13.382
OH, MY GOD. IT'S YOU.

35:13.382 --> 35:16.285
EXCUSE ME?

35:16.285 --> 35:19.448
YOU'RE THE ONE CARLOS IS
HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH.
 WHAT?

35:19.448 --> 35:22.451
WHAT?
 MAKES PERFECT SENSE. THAT'S WHY
THERE WERE ALL THOSE PHONE CALLS

35:22.451 --> 35:25.854
TO THIS HOUSE
FROM HIS CELL PHONE.
 YOU LOOKED AT MY CELL PHONE?

35:25.854 --> 35:28.397
YES, AND THANK GOD I DID.
WHORE!

35:28.397 --> 35:32.561
SHAMELESSLY SHOVING YOUR
MEATBALLS IN MY HUSBAND'S FACE.

35:32.561 --> 35:35.764
THERE WAS NO SHOVING. SOMETIMES
THEY SPONTANEOUSLY HEAVE.

35:35.764 --> 35:38.767
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND? I AM
NOT HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH SUSAN.

35:38.767 --> 35:41.710
MIKE, YOU BELIEVE ME, RIGHT?

35:41.710 --> 35:43.312
YEAH... I GUESS.

35:43.312 --> 35:46.475
IT'S JUST... WHY ARE YOU
CALLING OVER HERE ALL THE TIME?

35:46.475 --> 35:49.278
I'M NOT!
I ALWAYS CALL YOUR CELL!

35:49.278 --> 35:52.351
SUSAN, SAY SOMETHING.

35:52.351 --> 35:56.285
FORGET IT, CARLOS.
WE MIGHT AS WELL CONFESS.

35:56.285 --> 35:59.428
CONFESS WHAT?!

35:59.428 --> 36:02.631
YOU WOULDN'T TAKE MY MONEY
WHEN YOU WERE IN TROUBLE,

36:02.631 --> 36:05.634
AND, WELL, I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN
THAT CARLOS HAD A THING FOR ME,

36:05.634 --> 36:08.337
SO I TOLD HIM
THAT I WOULD SLEEP WITH HIM

36:08.337 --> 36:10.839
IF HE WOULD LOAN YOU MONEY.
 (gasps loudly)

36:10.839 --> 36:15.474
YOU SON OF A BITCH!
 WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
I DIDN'T TOUCH HER.

36:15.474 --> 36:18.477
ALL I DID WAS HELP A FRIEND
WHO SCREWED ME OVER

36:18.477 --> 36:22.481
BUYING DIAMOND EARRINGS
AND GRAND PIANOS.
 I TOLD YOU, THE PIANO WAS
A GIFT FROM SUSAN'S AUNT!

36:22.481 --> 36:24.513
YOU BOUGHT DIAMOND EARRINGS?

36:24.513 --> 36:28.617
OH, YEAH, WITH THE $50,000
THAT YOU BORROWED FROM CARLOS.

36:28.617 --> 36:30.689
YOU KNOW?

36:30.689 --> 36:32.361
YEAH!

36:32.361 --> 36:33.862
SO YOU TWO WERE JUST...

36:33.862 --> 36:36.625
SCREWING WITH YOU, YES.

36:37.926 --> 36:39.698
SO TELL ME, MIKE,

36:39.698 --> 36:42.601
DO YOU FEEL BETRAYED,
HUMILIATED?

36:42.601 --> 36:43.902
GOOD.

36:43.902 --> 36:46.905
BECAUSE I ONLY DID THIS
TO SHOW YOU WHAT IT FEELS LIKE

36:46.905 --> 36:49.908
WHEN THE PERSON THAT IS
SUPPOSED TO LOVE YOU THE MOST

36:49.908 --> 36:51.610
LIES TO YOU.

36:54.413 --> 36:57.416
WELL, I JUST DID IT
'CAUSE I WANT A SKI CHALET.

37:07.496 --> 37:10.499
I JUST KEEP TRYING
TO THINK WHAT I CAN SAY

37:10.499 --> 37:13.662
SO YOU'LL KNOW
HOW SORRY I AM.

37:13.662 --> 37:16.265
WELL, I DO KNOW,

37:16.265 --> 37:19.968
AND I'M NOT LOOKING
FOR ANOTHER APOLOGY.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.813
WHAT I AM LOOKING FOR IS
YOUR WORD

37:24.813 --> 37:28.347
THAT YOU WILL NEVER FREEZE ME
OUT LIKE THIS AGAIN.

37:28.347 --> 37:31.019
(scoffs) I SWEAR.

37:31.019 --> 37:33.652
(sighs)

37:33.652 --> 37:35.354
GOOD.

37:39.328 --> 37:41.390
SO IS THIS EVERYTHING?

37:41.390 --> 37:42.961
YEP.

37:42.961 --> 37:45.964
YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO WALK YOU THROUGH IT?

37:45.964 --> 37:48.437
NO. I...

37:48.437 --> 37:51.570
JUST WANT TO GET A SENSE
OF WHERE WE STAND.

37:51.570 --> 37:54.272
IF I HAVE ANY QUESTIONS,
I'LL ASK YOU LATER.

38:19.067 --> 38:20.369
(sighs)

38:20.369 --> 38:23.372
WHY ARE THEY PUTTING YOU
IN A COMA ON PURPOSE?

38:23.372 --> 38:25.374
YOUR--YOUR BRAIN SEEMS FINE.

38:25.374 --> 38:28.377
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU THINK
YOU'RE NAPOLéON.

38:28.377 --> 38:30.539
YOU DON'T THINK
YOU'RE NAPOLéON, DO YOU?

38:30.539 --> 38:33.412
THERE WAS SOME SWELLING
WHEN THEY BROUGHT ME IN.

38:33.412 --> 38:36.815
NOW IT'S--IT'S PUSHING
AGAINST MY SKULL.

38:36.815 --> 38:39.348
THEY SAY THIS IS
GONNA RELIEVE IT.

38:39.348 --> 38:40.889
(sighs)

38:42.421 --> 38:44.693
SO HOW LONG
ARE YOU GONNA BE OUT?

38:44.693 --> 38:47.055
A COUPLE OF DAYS.

38:47.055 --> 38:49.798
AND YOU KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE GONNA BE?

38:49.798 --> 38:51.630
WITH DANNY.

38:51.630 --> 38:55.504
ACTUALLY, I WAS THINKING
ABOUT BRINGING HIM BACK.
 NO WAY.

38:55.504 --> 38:58.066
IT'S BEEN THREE DAYS.
NOTHING'S HAPPENED.

38:58.066 --> 39:00.439
I'M STARTING TO THINK
YOU WERE WRONG.

39:00.439 --> 39:03.071
NO, ANGE, WE'RE NOT
TAKING ANY CHANCES.

39:04.943 --> 39:06.915
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?

39:06.915 --> 39:10.118
IF I GOTTA DRIVE YOU OUT OF TOWN
MYSELF, I'M GONNA DO IT.

39:10.118 --> 39:12.120
ANGE! (groans)
 NO, NO, NO.
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

39:12.120 --> 39:14.122
IF IT'LL KEEP YOU
FROM KILLING YOURSELF,

39:14.122 --> 39:16.885
I WILL GO STAY WITH DANNY.

39:16.885 --> 39:18.387
THANK YOU.

39:22.761 --> 39:26.565
YOU'RE EASY TO GET ALONG WITH,
YOU KNOW THAT?

39:41.009 --> 39:42.511
(purse thuds)

39:48.617 --> 39:51.389
(Patrick) HEY, ANGIE.

39:55.424 --> 39:57.666
YOU DON'T SEEM SURPRISED
TO SEE ME.

40:00.429 --> 40:02.901
DON'T BOTHER RUNNING UPSTAIRS.

40:02.901 --> 40:04.903
I ALREADY FOUND YOUR GUN.

40:09.938 --> 40:11.440
COME ON.

40:11.440 --> 40:12.941
AFTER ALL THIS TIME,

40:12.941 --> 40:15.944
THERE'S GOTTA BE SOMETHING
YOU WANT TO SAY TO ME.

40:15.944 --> 40:17.916
GO TO HELL.

40:17.916 --> 40:19.818
OH.

40:19.818 --> 40:21.520
COULDN'T YOU COME UP

40:21.520 --> 40:23.522
WITH SOMETHING
MORE ORIGINAL THAN THAT?

40:26.054 --> 40:30.929
I GUESS ALL THIS SUBURBAN LIVING
FORCES YOU TO THINK IN CLICHéS.

40:30.929 --> 40:33.532
SO IT WAS YOU.

40:33.532 --> 40:35.504
YOU RAN OVER NICK.

40:35.504 --> 40:37.466
WOULD YOU BELIEVE ME

40:37.466 --> 40:40.939
IF I TOLD YOU
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT?

40:40.939 --> 40:43.972
I SENT DANNY AWAY.
YOU WILL NEVER FIND HIM.

40:43.972 --> 40:46.515
THAT'S OKAY.
WE'RE NOT THAT CLOSE,

40:46.515 --> 40:48.647
SEEING AS HOW YOU
STOLE HIM FROM ME.

40:52.521 --> 40:54.523
ARE YOU GONNA KILL ME?

40:56.485 --> 40:57.686
NO.

40:59.958 --> 41:02.531
I NEED YOU ALIVE.

41:03.632 --> 41:06.595
YOU ARE GONNA DO ME A FAVOR.

41:08.236 --> 41:09.898
WHAT KIND OF FAVOR?

41:09.898 --> 41:12.671
(sighs) CAN WE DISCUSS IT
IN THE MORNING?

41:12.671 --> 41:14.673
I'VE HAD
AN EXHAUSTING COUPLE OF DAYS,

41:14.673 --> 41:17.245
WHAT WITH SEARCHING YOUR HOUSE
FOR FIREARMS

41:17.245 --> 41:19.247
AND RUNNING DOWN
DUDLEY DOUCHE BAG.

41:23.812 --> 41:25.514
SO...

41:25.514 --> 41:27.516
WHICH WAY TO THE GUEST ROOM?

41:27.516 --> 41:30.258
YOU THINK I'M GONNA
LET YOU STAY HERE?

41:30.258 --> 41:32.260
HOW ARE YOU GONNA STOP ME?

41:32.260 --> 41:35.564
IF YOU CALL THE COPS, THEY'LL
ARREST YOU AND LOVER BOY.

41:35.564 --> 41:38.166
AREN'T YOU AFRAID
I'LL KILL YOU IN YOUR SLEEP?

41:38.166 --> 41:39.728
ANGIE,

41:39.728 --> 41:42.571
IF THE LAST 20 YEARS
HAVE TAUGHT US ANYTHING,

41:42.571 --> 41:44.933
IT'S THAT YOU'RE NOT
COMFORTABLE KILLING PEOPLE.

41:49.037 --> 41:52.581
AND IF YOU DECIDE TO RUN AWAY,
JUST MAKE SURE

41:52.581 --> 41:54.713
YOU STOP BY THE HOSPITAL
AND SAY GOOD-BYE TO NICK,

41:54.713 --> 41:57.716
BECAUSE HE WON'T BE AROUND
MUCH LONGER AFTER YOU'VE GONE.

41:57.716 --> 42:00.288
PATRICK, PLEASE,
DON'T HURT HIM.

42:00.288 --> 42:04.092
JUST DO WHAT I TELL YOU, BABY,
AND I'LL LET YOU BOTH LIVE.

42:06.595 --> 42:08.757
MYSTERIOUS MEN--

42:08.757 --> 42:15.033
THEY MAKE PROMISES THEY HAVE
NO INTENTION OF KEEPING.

42:17.706 --> 42:21.870
THEY TELL LIES
TO GET WHAT THEY WANT.

42:24.042 --> 42:29.077
THEY MAY BE MORE DANGEROUS
THAN THEY SEEM.

42:30.979 --> 42:33.652
YES, OUR MOTHERS TOLD US

42:33.652 --> 42:37.225
WE CANNOT TRUST
THE MEN WE DON'T KNOW.

42:38.987 --> 42:41.559
AND THOSE WE DO KNOW?

42:41.559 --> 42:47.335
WELL, WE CAN'T ALWAYS
TRUST THEM EITHER.
