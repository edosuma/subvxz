WEBVTT

00:04.482 --> 00:06.963
Samantha Beck
and her father Richard

00:06.963 --> 00:09.313
are manufacturing and
running mass amounts of meth.

00:09.313 --> 00:10.793
I could go under.

00:10.793 --> 00:12.664
<i>Richard is
a white supremacist.</i>

00:12.664 --> 00:15.319
<i>And he's feeding it
to his grandchild.</i>

00:15.319 --> 00:16.929
My buyer's got
more product coming.

00:16.929 --> 00:18.148
Don't you get paid in cash?

00:18.148 --> 00:20.585
<i>With my dad,
it's not always in cash.</i>

00:20.585 --> 00:24.415
- What is it?
- Supplies for the end.

00:24.415 --> 00:26.026
<i>I was just too scared...</i>

00:27.853 --> 00:29.333
<i>Too numb.</i>

00:29.333 --> 00:33.772
It's not that I didn't feel
the same way that he did.

00:33.772 --> 00:35.209
<i>I did. I always have.</i>

01:03.150 --> 01:05.065
Hey.

01:05.065 --> 01:08.111
Good morning.

01:08.111 --> 01:10.026
Some night.

01:10.026 --> 01:13.421
Yeah. Yeah.

01:17.164 --> 01:18.556
Hey, I, uh...

01:20.471 --> 01:23.605
I don't want this to just be--

01:23.605 --> 01:25.128
you know.

01:27.130 --> 01:29.741
Me neither.

01:29.741 --> 01:30.960
Feels different.

01:48.325 --> 01:49.935
No, no, leave it.

01:49.935 --> 01:51.241
It's your undercover phone--

01:51.241 --> 01:53.896
No, go ahead, leave it.

01:53.896 --> 01:55.506
Kim, I don't wanna--no.

02:01.817 --> 02:03.253
Samantha Beck.

02:05.255 --> 02:09.259
Callum wants to show me his new
"Magic: the Gathering" card.

02:09.259 --> 02:12.088
I had a month undercover,
and this is as close

02:12.088 --> 02:13.350
as I am to busting
Richard Beck.

02:13.350 --> 02:14.612
I'm at "Magic" cards.

02:14.612 --> 02:17.485
Mm, it's just
gonna take time, Adam.

02:17.485 --> 02:19.313
The man never gets close
to the drugs.

02:19.313 --> 02:20.923
Oh, Samantha will
give you more

02:20.923 --> 02:22.229
closer you get to her
and her family.

02:22.229 --> 02:23.447
She will.
- I don't know. I don't know.

02:23.447 --> 02:25.057
She doesn't talk to me anymore

02:25.057 --> 02:28.626
about whatever the end is,
about the supplies they gather.

02:28.626 --> 02:29.888
Hasn't talked to me
about whatever it is

02:29.888 --> 02:31.325
her dad's planning,
and I don't even know

02:31.325 --> 02:33.762
if she really knows.

02:33.762 --> 02:35.807
Hey, it will come.

02:35.807 --> 02:37.331
We'll get there together.

02:37.331 --> 02:39.289
Just need a moment.

02:39.289 --> 02:41.161
One moment.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.511
It'll come.

02:43.511 --> 02:45.861
You are making this hard.

02:54.217 --> 02:55.436
I'll be back as soon as I can.

02:55.436 --> 02:57.960
All good. Do your thing.

02:57.960 --> 02:59.266
Where are you going?

02:59.266 --> 03:00.571
I'm gonna work, bumblebee.

03:00.571 --> 03:02.312
But it's the weekend.

03:02.312 --> 03:04.619
Yeah, well, I mean,
unfortunately bad guys,

03:04.619 --> 03:05.837
they don't take the day off.

03:07.883 --> 03:09.319
Aww.

03:09.319 --> 03:10.320
See you later.

03:10.320 --> 03:11.713
Okay, Dad.

03:26.467 --> 03:27.859
- Morning.
- Hey.

03:27.859 --> 03:29.209
Hi.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.298
Just robbed the doughnut shop,
so let's dig in

03:31.298 --> 03:32.473
before the cops get here.

03:32.473 --> 03:33.865
- Adam.
- Hey, man.

03:33.865 --> 03:37.217
Look, I got a super rare
Echo Fighter card.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.435
Well, look at you.

03:38.435 --> 03:39.871
You know what they say.

03:39.871 --> 03:42.439
Only the best kids
get the good cards.

03:44.267 --> 03:46.313
Thanks.
- You're welcome.

03:48.793 --> 03:50.273
Come on, kid.

03:50.273 --> 03:54.190
Come on. Hup!

03:56.279 --> 03:58.673
We're going again. You ready?
- Yeah!

04:02.764 --> 04:06.550
Nicely done, buddy.

04:06.550 --> 04:09.205
Nice job, Callum.

04:09.205 --> 04:11.076
I can't sleep.

04:11.076 --> 04:12.687
Again?

04:15.080 --> 04:16.865
Why am I getting the feeling
that this is

04:16.865 --> 04:19.694
becoming a new round two
bedtime routine kind of thing?

04:19.694 --> 04:21.913
Come on. Let's go.

04:21.913 --> 04:24.264
Hey, can you
help me with this?

04:24.264 --> 04:25.439
You can't sleep, bud?

04:25.439 --> 04:28.006
No. The slide stock's jammed.

04:28.006 --> 04:29.269
Slide stock?

04:29.269 --> 04:30.400
Yeah.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.097
Who taught you that word?

04:32.097 --> 04:33.447
My grandpa.

04:33.447 --> 04:35.536
He let me shoot his rifle
at the mill once.

04:38.452 --> 04:40.845
Last summer.

04:40.845 --> 04:42.543
All right, well,
this is a toy,

04:42.543 --> 04:44.458
so no slide stock.

04:47.548 --> 04:50.551
Looks like your ammo
is a piece of candy, so.

04:50.551 --> 04:52.422
Callum, you gotta get back
to bed, okay?

04:52.422 --> 04:54.250
Read if you have to,
but you better be in bed.

04:58.428 --> 04:59.647
What's up?

04:59.647 --> 05:01.736
It's another Dale problem.

05:01.736 --> 05:04.260
My dad wants me to go to his
house and help his sorry ass.

05:04.260 --> 05:06.306
Why does he keep
that guy around?

05:06.306 --> 05:08.786
He's known him
since he was a kid.

05:08.786 --> 05:10.614
It's like the son
my dad never had.

05:10.614 --> 05:12.355
What'd he do now?

05:12.355 --> 05:15.750
I don't know.
It sounds serious.

05:15.750 --> 05:17.839
Where am I gonna find a sitter?

05:17.839 --> 05:20.015
Why don't you
let me handle it?

05:20.015 --> 05:21.233
I know Dale.

05:21.233 --> 05:22.365
We been loading
trucks together.

05:22.365 --> 05:24.628
He knows me.
You stay with Callum.

05:24.628 --> 05:26.151
Give me a chance
to prove to your dad

05:26.151 --> 05:27.370
that I'm actually
worth something.

05:28.980 --> 05:30.721
Let me take it.

05:32.027 --> 05:32.941
Okay.

05:34.290 --> 05:35.944
Okay.

05:44.866 --> 05:46.215
Hey, Dale.

05:46.215 --> 05:47.564
Yo, you here?

05:47.564 --> 05:49.653
It's Adam. Sam sent me.

05:49.653 --> 05:51.481
Oh, they sent the new guy?

05:51.481 --> 05:53.831
Jesus. I got this.
You didn't have to come.

05:53.831 --> 05:55.833
I don't need a damn babysitter
watching me.

05:57.835 --> 06:00.360
What's that smell?
Is that bleach?

06:02.797 --> 06:05.060
Yes, man. That's bleach.

06:05.060 --> 06:06.931
Smell the bleach. Take a whiff.

06:06.931 --> 06:09.847
Go back and report to Sammy
and Richard that I'm good.

06:09.847 --> 06:11.371
Nah, I'm just doing
what I'm told.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.111
You know how it is.
What is all this?

06:17.159 --> 06:19.596
You know what?

06:19.596 --> 06:21.424
Road trip, new guy.

06:21.424 --> 06:23.513
Come on, let's go.

06:23.513 --> 06:24.775
Shut the door.

06:29.214 --> 06:31.391
Taste that new batch of Tina?

06:31.391 --> 06:33.828
Haven't gotten near
the product.

06:33.828 --> 06:36.831
It's like drinking
a keg of Red Bull, man.

06:36.831 --> 06:39.137
I've been up for,
like, 48 hours.

06:41.226 --> 06:44.665
You ever wonder what happens
if you, like, never sleep?

06:44.665 --> 06:47.581
I heard you hallucinate
and, like, see bats and stuff.

06:49.539 --> 06:52.237
How'd you get
those cuts on your hand?

06:52.237 --> 06:55.545
Just got in a little scrap,
that's all.

06:55.545 --> 06:59.244
- Little scrap.
- Yeah.

06:59.244 --> 07:01.464
What are we doing, Dale?

07:19.177 --> 07:20.962
Whoo!

07:23.791 --> 07:26.097
Nothing like a fire
in the winter, huh?

07:27.882 --> 07:32.016
See, clothes, shoes,
even threw my damn underwear

07:32.016 --> 07:34.584
in there, all right?

07:34.584 --> 07:36.194
It's like it never happened.

07:37.631 --> 07:39.415
Never happened.

07:46.770 --> 07:48.380
Dale's not gonna talk to me.

07:48.380 --> 07:50.382
He wouldn't say a word
to me the entire drive back.

07:50.382 --> 07:52.297
But I'm telling you,
that man, he did something.

07:52.297 --> 07:53.734
It was something bad.

07:53.734 --> 07:55.518
There was a hell of a lot
of blood on those clothes.

07:55.518 --> 07:57.477
Forensics came up empty
on the fire.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.000
No blood, no DNA.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.784
No homicides or assaults
with a cutting instrument

08:00.784 --> 08:02.220
reported last night.

08:02.220 --> 08:03.570
And no one showed up
at any of the hospitals

08:03.570 --> 08:05.049
with lacerations.

08:05.049 --> 08:07.008
Dale's phone been off
for about 48 hours,

08:07.008 --> 08:09.140
so it's gonna be hard as hell
to track him down that way.

08:09.140 --> 08:11.273
I think we ought
to bring them in.

08:11.273 --> 08:13.405
If we bring him in,
you'll be made.

08:13.405 --> 08:14.581
The case will be blown.

08:14.581 --> 08:16.800
This man, he did something.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.585
He committed a crime.

08:18.585 --> 08:20.674
All right, so find out
what the crime was first,

08:20.674 --> 08:22.632
then bring him in
without getting burned.

08:22.632 --> 08:24.634
Why don't you go ahead
start with his car?

08:24.634 --> 08:25.853
If he was driving it
last night,

08:25.853 --> 08:27.507
might be blood or forensics
in it.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.030
If we seize his car
on the books,

08:29.030 --> 08:31.641
we're in the same problem.
Ruze's cover is blown.

08:31.641 --> 08:33.643
So get creative.

08:33.643 --> 08:35.906
Secure the warrant.
Just don't serve it.

08:42.304 --> 08:44.567
Richard, I don't need
someone following me around

08:44.567 --> 08:45.655
doing things that I've been

08:45.655 --> 08:46.787
doing for you
for how many years.

08:46.787 --> 08:48.223
How many years
I been doing this?

08:48.223 --> 08:51.531
No one's gonna find out
a goddamn thing!

08:55.404 --> 08:57.362
- What's up, man?
- Hey.

08:57.362 --> 08:58.842
You all right?

08:58.842 --> 09:01.236
I'm all right.
I'm always all right.

09:01.236 --> 09:02.324
Come on in.

09:02.324 --> 09:03.673
Thanks.

09:03.673 --> 09:05.632
Richard, how you doing, sir?

09:05.632 --> 09:07.111
Fine.

09:09.374 --> 09:11.986
Just fine.

09:14.379 --> 09:16.207
Damn.

09:16.207 --> 09:17.426
What's up with the boss?

09:17.426 --> 09:20.037
I don't know.
Hates Mondays, I guess.

09:22.344 --> 09:24.215
What are you doing here?

09:24.215 --> 09:26.391
Ah, checking on you.

09:26.391 --> 09:27.784
Thought you could use a drink.

09:27.784 --> 09:30.874
You know last night,
I was just following orders.

09:30.874 --> 09:32.528
You know what I mean?

09:32.528 --> 09:34.530
It's all good.

09:34.530 --> 09:35.662
I could definitely use a drink.

09:35.662 --> 09:37.185
All right, hell yeah.

09:37.185 --> 09:38.926
Let's go. I'll drive.

10:02.776 --> 10:04.212
How long you gonna be?

10:07.781 --> 10:09.173
All right.

10:13.134 --> 10:15.832
You've done this before.

10:15.832 --> 10:17.791
<i>Sin comentarios.</i>

10:19.662 --> 10:22.752
Let's go.

10:22.752 --> 10:24.449
Techs did a deep dive
on the Firebird,

10:24.449 --> 10:26.582
and Dale got the carpets
professionally cleaned, like,

10:26.582 --> 10:29.367
recently--damn near three hours
before we got there.

10:29.367 --> 10:31.631
Yeah, they found pebbles
of fresh cold patch asphalt

10:31.631 --> 10:33.371
in the wheel wells.
- Okay.

10:33.371 --> 10:34.721
You check with
Streets and Sanitation?

10:34.721 --> 10:36.113
Yes, sir.

10:36.113 --> 10:38.289
25 crews out there
every day filling potholes,

10:38.289 --> 10:40.596
and we've got a list
of 100 trees, approximately,

10:40.596 --> 10:41.945
but at least it
narrows somewhat.

10:41.945 --> 10:44.382
CPIC reached out to me.

10:44.382 --> 10:46.080
Sent over this video.

10:51.738 --> 10:53.653
Traffic cam
caught Dale's Firebird

10:53.653 --> 10:55.132
going fast down a side street

10:55.132 --> 10:57.221
three blocks from Ashland
on the Near West Side.

10:57.221 --> 10:58.788
What's the name
of that side street?

10:58.788 --> 11:00.224
It looks like North Troy.

11:00.224 --> 11:03.053
Yeah, North Troy
was repaved yesterday.

11:03.053 --> 11:06.753
Okay, so 9:51, two hours
later, Dale's calling for help.

11:06.753 --> 11:08.929
So what's on that street?

11:08.929 --> 11:10.800
Not much,
bunch of old houses,

11:10.800 --> 11:12.280
Chinese restaurant, laundromat.

11:12.280 --> 11:14.848
Okay, so search
every inch of North Troy.

11:14.848 --> 11:16.632
Come on, boots on the ground.
Let's go.

11:16.632 --> 11:17.894
Mm-hmm.

11:17.894 --> 11:19.591
All right, thanks, Kim.

11:19.591 --> 11:20.810
Laundromat's clear.

11:20.810 --> 11:21.768
Nothing on the rest
of the block.

11:21.768 --> 11:22.986
Okay.

11:24.771 --> 11:26.686
Yo, this place
should be open.

11:34.041 --> 11:35.782
Torres, side door.

11:56.803 --> 11:59.109
Chicago PD, anybody in here?

12:28.835 --> 12:30.488
Bodies.

12:42.022 --> 12:43.937
5-0-21 Ocean.

12:43.937 --> 12:44.981
<i>Go ahead, Ocean.</i>

12:44.981 --> 12:47.636
Yeah, we got two DOAs.

12:47.636 --> 12:49.507
202 North Troy.

12:49.507 --> 12:51.074
Roll the crime lab.

12:51.074 --> 12:54.251
Have Patrol shut down the block
and secure the perimeter.

12:54.251 --> 12:56.950
<i>Copy, Ocean.
Crime lab and units en route.</i>

13:09.092 --> 13:11.181
Chan and Myeong Rae,
the owners.

13:11.181 --> 13:12.835
Ran this place for 17 years.

13:12.835 --> 13:16.578
Second generation immigrants
just trying to live the dream.

13:16.578 --> 13:18.232
Cash register
wasn't even touched,

13:18.232 --> 13:20.190
so it couldn't have
been a robbery.

13:20.190 --> 13:22.192
They were targeted.

13:22.192 --> 13:23.585
And what the hell
am I looking at?

13:23.585 --> 13:25.543
Why they were targeted.

13:25.543 --> 13:27.937
"Neuer tag"
is German for new day.

13:27.937 --> 13:29.852
It was a Nazi rallying cry.

13:29.852 --> 13:31.245
We got a hate crime.

13:33.551 --> 13:35.205
All right, what else?

13:35.205 --> 13:37.251
TOD was around 9:30
last night.

13:37.251 --> 13:39.731
Each of the victims got at
least 20 sharp force injuries.

13:39.731 --> 13:41.690
Deep cuts.
- Rage kill.

13:41.690 --> 13:43.039
Yeah.

13:43.039 --> 13:44.519
All right, grab the team,
canvass the block,

13:44.519 --> 13:46.913
check PODs, find me a witness.

13:46.913 --> 13:48.523
We are gonna use this.

13:48.523 --> 13:51.221
We are gonna make this case
on bail for these murders

13:51.221 --> 13:53.267
and then flip them for Richard.

13:53.267 --> 13:54.398
I want both of them.

13:54.398 --> 13:55.356
All right, let's go.

13:55.356 --> 13:56.748
Okay.

14:00.274 --> 14:03.581
You sure? Yeah, all right. Thanks.

14:03.581 --> 14:05.322
So Sarge, tech said
they did not find

14:05.322 --> 14:06.758
Dale's DNA at the restaurant.

14:06.758 --> 14:09.109
We know he was driving
five blocks away.

14:09.109 --> 14:11.415
We could bring him, squeeze
him, lie about the blood.

14:11.415 --> 14:13.853
No, we need more.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.550
I might have it.

14:15.550 --> 14:17.813
Security from a tire shop
behind the restaurant

14:17.813 --> 14:18.901
caught something.

14:22.339 --> 14:25.690
This is 9:41 last night.

14:29.912 --> 14:31.914
All right, too short.
That sure as hell ain't Dale.

14:31.914 --> 14:33.307
Wait, rewind it.

14:33.307 --> 14:35.744
Go back to the car.

14:35.744 --> 14:37.702
Can anyone make out that plate?

14:37.702 --> 14:41.358
Okay, Illinois tags for sure.

14:41.358 --> 14:43.534
FLN--FLN8-something?

14:43.534 --> 14:44.622
I don't know.

14:44.622 --> 14:47.190
Oh, wait, back it up.

14:47.190 --> 14:48.322
That guy right there, you see?

14:48.322 --> 14:49.323
He's wearing an apron
or something.

14:49.323 --> 14:50.672
He could be a busboy.

14:50.672 --> 14:52.152
Yeah, Kev,
I think you're right.

14:52.152 --> 14:53.718
I got a 2016 Kia.

14:53.718 --> 14:55.459
The plates are FLN822C.

14:55.459 --> 14:57.026
The car comes back
to a Ken Mao.

14:57.026 --> 15:00.160
Got W-2s for the last
two years at Rae's Restaurant.

15:00.160 --> 15:02.945
No sheet, the timing's right.
I think we got a witness.

15:02.945 --> 15:04.991
All right, Kim,
you and Hailey get him in here.

15:04.991 --> 15:07.341
All right, be safe.

15:08.820 --> 15:12.172
Chicago PD, Ken Mao,
are you in there?

15:14.087 --> 15:15.262
Excuse me.

15:15.262 --> 15:16.306
I'm Detective Upton.

15:16.306 --> 15:17.568
This is Officer Burgess.

15:17.568 --> 15:18.569
We're looking
for your neighbor.

15:18.569 --> 15:19.831
Have you seen him?

15:19.831 --> 15:21.311
I saw him come home
last night.

15:21.311 --> 15:24.053
He--he was crying real bad.

15:24.053 --> 15:26.142
Do you think something bad
happened to him?

15:26.142 --> 15:27.535
Ken.

15:27.535 --> 15:29.232
We don't know, ma'am.
Thank you for your time.

15:30.451 --> 15:32.148
Ken.

15:55.911 --> 15:56.912
Clear.

16:07.749 --> 16:09.925
- Ken, are you in there?
- Get out!

16:09.925 --> 16:11.100
I've got a gun!

16:11.100 --> 16:13.015
Ken, we're police, okay?

16:13.015 --> 16:15.017
I know that you're scared,
but we just wanna talk

16:15.017 --> 16:16.323
to you about last night.

16:16.323 --> 16:19.108
Ken, I'm gonna
slide my ID to you, all right?

16:21.502 --> 16:23.808
I'm opening the door now, okay?

16:25.767 --> 16:27.464
Get your finger
off the trigger.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.990
Ken, listen to me, get your
finger off the trigger.

16:33.557 --> 16:35.037
Put your gun down.

16:35.037 --> 16:37.126
Ken, look at me.

16:37.126 --> 16:39.520
Look at my badge.

16:39.520 --> 16:41.739
Okay? Look at my badge.

16:41.739 --> 16:44.394
We're police.
We are who we say we are.

16:44.394 --> 16:45.961
You gotta put the gun down now.

16:47.441 --> 16:49.095
Put the gun down now!

16:49.095 --> 16:51.010
Sorry. Sorry.

16:56.624 --> 16:58.539
Did you get the man?

17:07.809 --> 17:11.073
I was washing dishes,

17:11.073 --> 17:16.209
and I caught a glimpse
of this big, masked guy

17:16.209 --> 17:18.341
running into the back office.

17:18.341 --> 17:21.475
Had a knife and I just--

17:22.998 --> 17:24.173
I froze.

17:27.133 --> 17:29.091
He was yelling at them,
something about how

17:29.091 --> 17:30.788
they ruined the block.

17:30.788 --> 17:35.271
Said he used to live
around there.

17:35.271 --> 17:37.360
Then I--

17:37.360 --> 17:41.843
I heard, uh, stabs, screaming,

17:41.843 --> 17:43.540
and I went to grab my--

17:43.540 --> 17:45.020
my phone to call 911.

17:45.020 --> 17:47.544
But I couldn't--
I couldn't find it.

17:47.544 --> 17:51.505
I panicked and--

17:54.638 --> 17:56.118
It's okay.

17:56.118 --> 17:57.467
No.

17:57.467 --> 17:59.513
I just curled up in a ball.

18:05.519 --> 18:06.824
I should have done more.

18:06.824 --> 18:09.566
I thought he might have
seen me, so I just...

18:10.872 --> 18:13.918
Ran home, and then I hid.

18:13.918 --> 18:20.273
Did you, uh, see anything
specific about him?

18:20.273 --> 18:22.492
No.

18:22.492 --> 18:23.928
But I remember the knife.

18:23.928 --> 18:28.194
It was big--maybe 6 inches,
a green handle.

18:28.194 --> 18:30.065
That's good.
That's a good detail.

18:30.065 --> 18:32.067
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

18:32.067 --> 18:33.764
Good.

18:33.764 --> 18:37.986
The Raes, they, um...

18:37.986 --> 18:42.033
they treated me like a son, and...

18:42.033 --> 18:45.167
And someone
just slaughters them.

18:51.608 --> 18:53.480
I'll get the papers started.

18:57.005 --> 18:58.049
Ava's mom.

18:58.049 --> 18:59.660
The girls are done with dinner.

18:59.660 --> 19:02.402
I gotta go get Mack
from Ferrera's.

19:02.402 --> 19:06.188
Listen, let me go get her.

19:06.188 --> 19:07.320
I could use the air.

19:09.583 --> 19:10.714
All right.

19:29.255 --> 19:32.910
Adam.

19:32.910 --> 19:35.217
Sam, what are you--
what are you doing here?

19:35.217 --> 19:36.697
Looking for you.

19:36.697 --> 19:37.872
Look, it's an emergency.

19:37.872 --> 19:39.221
My dad said
not to call or text.

19:39.221 --> 19:42.964
Okay, how'd you know
I would be here?

19:42.964 --> 19:44.748
Look, I've seen you here.
You come for dinner.

19:44.748 --> 19:46.315
You've seen me here when?

19:46.315 --> 19:47.360
Look, why does it matter?

19:47.360 --> 19:49.884
You've seen me here when,
Sam?

19:49.884 --> 19:51.581
When we first met,
I followed you

19:51.581 --> 19:54.149
for a couple of days just
to make sure I could trust you.

19:54.149 --> 19:57.805
You followed me? Jesus.

19:57.805 --> 19:58.980
Look, I watched you
eat dinner by yourself.

19:58.980 --> 20:02.288
It's not a big deal.
Look, we gotta go.

20:02.288 --> 20:03.811
Something's going on.

20:03.811 --> 20:05.204
I can't talk to you
about it here.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.814
- All right, I--
- Come on, we gotta go.

20:06.814 --> 20:08.032
I have to cancel something
real quick.

20:08.032 --> 20:09.251
Just--
- Come on, Adam.

20:09.251 --> 20:11.732
I'm coming.

20:11.732 --> 20:13.908
- Come on.
- I'm coming.

20:21.611 --> 20:22.786
Let's go.

20:48.682 --> 20:50.727
All right, talk to me.

20:50.727 --> 20:53.077
What are we doing?

20:53.077 --> 20:54.470
Sam, your energy's
killing me here.

20:54.470 --> 20:56.342
What the hell are we doing?
Where are we going?

20:56.342 --> 20:57.908
You have your gun?

20:57.908 --> 21:00.259
No. Why?

21:00.259 --> 21:02.261
Open the glove box.

21:11.574 --> 21:13.794
- What'd you do?
- I didn't do anything yet.

21:13.794 --> 21:16.013
What's "yet"?
What does "yet" mean?

21:16.013 --> 21:18.189
It's Dale.

21:18.189 --> 21:19.321
Is this about
the other night?

21:19.321 --> 21:20.540
The other night?

21:20.540 --> 21:22.063
I was with him.
He was burning clothes.

21:22.063 --> 21:23.673
He didn't tell you about it?

21:23.673 --> 21:25.719
No.

21:25.719 --> 21:29.244
All I know is that my dad says
he's getting too reckless.

21:29.244 --> 21:32.900
He's drawing heat.
He needs us to handle it.

21:32.900 --> 21:34.771
Handle it?

21:34.771 --> 21:37.818
Handle it meaning kill him?
Am I right?

21:37.818 --> 21:39.341
Yeah?

21:39.341 --> 21:40.647
Sam, we can't just
kill the man.

21:40.647 --> 21:41.691
It's Dale.

21:41.691 --> 21:43.432
Look, it is a test
of loyalty.

21:43.432 --> 21:45.869
I have already tried to think
of every single way out.

21:45.869 --> 21:48.785
If we don't do this,
there'll be punishment.

21:48.785 --> 21:50.091
Okay, all right.

21:50.091 --> 21:51.484
We'll--we'll just
keep thinking.

21:51.484 --> 21:55.052
If we think too much,
he'll kill us.

22:04.192 --> 22:06.673
Is there a plan?

22:06.673 --> 22:08.718
Yeah, we're supposed to
take him to a house in Pullman.

22:08.718 --> 22:11.242
Dale thinks we're picking up
new lab equipment.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.996
Listen, listen,
let me take care of this.

22:25.996 --> 22:28.129
All right, you make an excuse,
something about Callum.

22:28.129 --> 22:30.871
I can't, Adam.

22:30.871 --> 22:32.046
We can't.

22:46.365 --> 22:47.409
<i>Adam.</i>

22:47.409 --> 22:49.542
<i>I got about 30 seconds.</i>

22:49.542 --> 22:51.195
Richard Beck ordered
a hit on Dale.

22:51.195 --> 22:52.762
He wants me and Sam to do it.

22:52.762 --> 22:54.547
<i>She's inside grabbing Dale
right now.</i>

22:54.547 --> 22:56.070
<i>I'm sitting in the car.</i>

22:56.070 --> 22:57.593
Have you got Richard on tape?

22:57.593 --> 22:59.421
No. No, it was all to Sam.

22:59.421 --> 23:01.510
It's all hearsay, all in code.

23:01.510 --> 23:04.383
<i>She hasn't even directly said
that he ordered Dale's death.</i>

23:04.383 --> 23:06.994
Boss, I do not know
where we're going.

23:06.994 --> 23:10.258
I do not have a COH.
I'm completely naked out here.

23:10.258 --> 23:11.651
All right,
just stall if you can.

23:11.651 --> 23:13.870
Torres and Atwater'll
get to you ASAP.

23:13.870 --> 23:15.959
<i>We'll take it on the fly
from there.</i>

23:24.272 --> 23:26.448
- Hey, you all right?
- Hey.

23:26.448 --> 23:28.624
I told you not to have
that last Banshee.

23:30.104 --> 23:32.367
Some gang-banging pricks
stole my bird.

23:32.367 --> 23:34.238
Really?

23:34.238 --> 23:35.675
You gotta be kidding me.

23:35.675 --> 23:38.417
Wish I was.

23:41.245 --> 23:43.291
I'm just saying
it's a breakdown of everything.

23:43.291 --> 23:44.727
A man can't even
keep his car safe

23:44.727 --> 23:46.599
in his own garage anymore.

23:46.599 --> 23:48.470
We're not exactly saints, brother.

23:48.470 --> 23:50.994
We get paid
to get people high.

23:50.994 --> 23:52.300
Everybody wins.

23:52.300 --> 23:54.171
Drug laws are a joke, new guy.

23:54.171 --> 23:55.346
The system's a joke.

23:58.959 --> 23:59.960
You guys hear about that

23:59.960 --> 24:01.962
so-called hate crime
on the news?

24:01.962 --> 24:03.050
No. What happened?

24:07.837 --> 24:10.797
<i>Chinese restaurant
got robbed.</i>

24:10.797 --> 24:12.102
<i>All they wanna talk about
is how tough</i>

24:12.102 --> 24:15.410
the Asian American experience
is in Chicago.

24:16.716 --> 24:19.066
What about the white man's
experience?

24:19.066 --> 24:20.807
White man that used to own
that restaurant

24:20.807 --> 24:23.026
but couldn't make a dime
once the neighborhood

24:23.026 --> 24:24.811
was flooded with insects.

24:24.811 --> 24:27.640
<i>White man whose families
were left with nothing.</i>

24:27.640 --> 24:29.206
<i>Walk around
their own neighborhood</i>

24:29.206 --> 24:31.948
like a stranger every day.

24:31.948 --> 24:33.515
Sick of it.

24:36.387 --> 24:38.781
Sam, where is this place?

24:38.781 --> 24:42.263
Pullman, 4344 South Vernon?

24:42.263 --> 24:43.656
<i>What? 4344 South Vernon?</i>

24:43.656 --> 24:44.874
- Hear that?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

24:44.874 --> 24:46.876
<i>All right.</i>

25:01.543 --> 25:02.849
Let's go.

25:11.335 --> 25:12.859
You got a key?

25:12.859 --> 25:14.904
Under a rock under the porch.

25:27.090 --> 25:29.005
Aha.

25:29.005 --> 25:30.398
Here we go.

25:55.641 --> 25:57.730
There's nothing in here.

25:57.730 --> 26:00.689
I think most of it's
in the basement, right, Sam?

26:00.689 --> 26:02.909
- Yeah.
- We'll take care of it.

26:02.909 --> 26:04.084
You grab the stuff
in the bedroom.

26:04.084 --> 26:05.085
Come on, big man.

26:19.229 --> 26:21.057
- Where's the stuff at, man?
- I don't know.

26:21.057 --> 26:22.972
Maybe she got
the address wrong.

26:31.894 --> 26:35.637
- Come on.
- Quiet. Quiet.

26:35.637 --> 26:37.117
- Take it, homey.
- Relax. Relax.

26:37.117 --> 26:38.074
Yeah.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.296
Shut up. Stop. Stop.

26:42.296 --> 26:45.081
Shut up. Shut up.

26:47.388 --> 26:48.607
Rich wants you dead.

26:57.528 --> 27:00.140
I'm a cop, dumb-dumb.

27:00.140 --> 27:02.795
I just saved
your worthless life.

27:09.062 --> 27:10.454
You got this?

27:10.454 --> 27:11.847
Mm-hmm.

27:19.159 --> 27:21.335
Come on. Let's go.

27:21.335 --> 27:23.380
Sam, I just saw someone in
the alley through the window.

27:23.380 --> 27:24.599
We need to go right now.

27:24.599 --> 27:26.732
Come on. Let's go.

27:29.822 --> 27:31.650
Sam.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.173
- Oh, my God, oh, my God.
- You're all right.

27:33.173 --> 27:35.871
We're all right. You're okay.
We're okay.

27:35.871 --> 27:38.744
You gotta call your dad.
You tell him it's done.

27:38.744 --> 27:41.050
Then we need to leave
the body there.

27:42.965 --> 27:44.706
Hey, hey.

27:44.706 --> 27:48.275
Hey, take a count, all right?

27:50.407 --> 27:52.018
We're driving away from here.

27:52.018 --> 27:54.629
You're going home to your kid.

27:54.629 --> 27:57.458
Let's go.

28:15.432 --> 28:17.217
Hey, hey! Whoa, hey!

28:17.217 --> 28:19.262
Stop reaching!
Quit reaching, all right?

28:34.800 --> 28:36.758
I got him. Come on.

28:45.245 --> 28:46.812
You gonna pay for this,
you goddamn--

28:46.812 --> 28:48.422
Goddamn what?

28:48.422 --> 28:49.815
Huh?

28:49.815 --> 28:51.599
Say it so you can
make it easy for me.

28:51.599 --> 28:53.427
Say it, huh?

28:53.427 --> 28:54.428
Thought so.

29:02.958 --> 29:04.481
Uh, Dale.

29:04.481 --> 29:06.875
I don't think
you're hearing us.

29:06.875 --> 29:08.572
Your boss,

29:08.572 --> 29:11.401
the man who helped raise you,

29:11.401 --> 29:12.881
ordered your murder.

29:12.881 --> 29:14.187
I heard you.

29:14.187 --> 29:15.362
Okay.

29:15.362 --> 29:17.843
And we can put him away
for life.

29:17.843 --> 29:19.192
You just gotta work with us.

29:19.192 --> 29:21.020
Why would I work for you?

29:21.020 --> 29:23.805
Because you don't wanna rot
in the penitentiary, Dale.

29:23.805 --> 29:25.764
No, you don't understand.

29:25.764 --> 29:29.898
We are at war,
and I'm a soldier.

29:29.898 --> 29:31.552
And I messed up.

29:31.552 --> 29:34.511
If it was reversed
and I was Richard,

29:34.511 --> 29:36.644
I'd have done the same thing.

29:36.644 --> 29:39.255
The cause is bigger
than both of us.

29:41.692 --> 29:43.520
Okay, well, talk to us
about this cause.

29:43.520 --> 29:46.393
I mean, what y'all
got going on?

29:46.393 --> 29:48.569
You'll hear about it
soon enough.

29:50.832 --> 29:53.139
Okay, Dale, this is what
I want you to do for me.

29:54.401 --> 29:58.448
Imagine Danville Prison,

29:58.448 --> 30:00.537
and I'm not sure
if you knew this,

30:00.537 --> 30:05.194
but the brothers run H block
at the Danville Prison.

30:05.194 --> 30:07.936
And all I really gotta do is
just drop your white ass off,

30:07.936 --> 30:09.764
and as soon as they
hear about your cause

30:09.764 --> 30:12.811
and know about your history,
they're gonna own you.

30:14.464 --> 30:15.901
Like, for real,
you probably gonna have to keep

30:15.901 --> 30:17.859
an ice pack in your shorts.

30:17.859 --> 30:19.165
Ouch.

30:21.428 --> 30:25.693
And when they get bored,
they'll cut you

30:25.693 --> 30:28.914
and watch
your racist ass bleed.

30:28.914 --> 30:31.046
You trying to scare me?

30:31.046 --> 30:33.396
Mm-mm.

30:33.396 --> 30:34.615
I'm just giving you
what we got,

30:34.615 --> 30:36.617
and you can do
with it what you want.

30:39.446 --> 30:40.839
We'll check on you later, Dale.

30:47.454 --> 30:48.847
That idiot ain't flipping.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.326
He just keeps going on and on
about how the cause

30:50.326 --> 30:51.675
is bigger than him and Richard.

30:51.675 --> 30:53.721
He says he gets why Richard
wanted him dead.

30:53.721 --> 30:55.418
He messed up.

30:55.418 --> 30:57.029
We don't have Dale
on the Rae murders.

30:57.029 --> 30:58.639
Richard's gonna realize sooner
or later I didn't kill him.

30:58.639 --> 31:00.336
What do we do? Am I burned?

31:00.336 --> 31:02.034
We keep him dead
as long as we can.

31:02.034 --> 31:03.600
You logged him in at Med
as a Doe?

31:03.600 --> 31:06.212
Yes, sir. All right, good.
That means we got 48 hours.

31:06.212 --> 31:07.778
We keep working.

31:07.778 --> 31:10.259
We need hard,
fast physical evidence

31:10.259 --> 31:11.695
that pins those murders
to Dale.

31:11.695 --> 31:13.784
Nothing he can wiggle out of.

31:13.784 --> 31:15.699
Believe me,
if this prick is facing life,

31:15.699 --> 31:18.093
he is gonna flip,
cause or no cause.

31:18.093 --> 31:19.703
This'll all be done.

31:19.703 --> 31:21.531
So get back out there,
re-canvass.

31:21.531 --> 31:24.012
Find that knife
or find a new witness.

31:24.012 --> 31:25.884
Let's go.
- All right.

31:27.146 --> 31:28.538
I see.

31:28.538 --> 31:29.888
No, thanks for your time,
Mr. Metz.

31:31.585 --> 31:34.066
Last customer
signed a credit card at 8:54.

31:34.066 --> 31:36.677
Hoping he forgot something.
Went back, no luck.

31:36.677 --> 31:38.722
- Hey, anything?
- No, ma'am.

31:38.722 --> 31:40.376
Just a real scared neighborhood
at this point.

31:40.376 --> 31:41.595
Hang on.

31:41.595 --> 31:43.379
I've been re-tracking
Dale's route home

31:43.379 --> 31:45.642
after the murder, and new
POD footage just came in.

31:47.688 --> 31:49.864
Okay.
So here comes his Firebird.

31:49.864 --> 31:52.084
It's 9:52,
20 minutes after the murder.

31:52.084 --> 31:54.913
If he's gonna go straight home,
he should turn right on Ogden.

31:54.913 --> 31:58.612
Instead he turns left on 58th,
disappears from view.

31:58.612 --> 32:00.527
20 minutes later, he returns.

32:00.527 --> 32:02.616
So why the detour?

32:02.616 --> 32:03.922
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

32:05.967 --> 32:08.274
I know that place. Yeah.

32:08.274 --> 32:09.797
Closed manufacturing plant.

32:09.797 --> 32:11.146
I heard Richard
and his guys talk about it.

32:11.146 --> 32:12.800
They call it the mill.

32:12.800 --> 32:15.411
Something like, you know,
three generations of Becks

32:15.411 --> 32:17.587
worked there until,
according to them anyway,

32:17.587 --> 32:19.241
immigrants came in,
destroyed it.

32:19.241 --> 32:20.416
Hmm.

32:20.416 --> 32:22.070
Well, why go there
after the murder?

32:22.070 --> 32:23.942
Hide something?

32:23.942 --> 32:26.422
Right, hide something
you wanna keep.

32:55.147 --> 32:56.322
Shell casings.

33:01.588 --> 33:04.112
16 gauge.

33:04.112 --> 33:05.505
Richard's favorite.

33:42.585 --> 33:44.457
You got something?

33:49.157 --> 33:51.246
Good eye.

33:51.246 --> 33:53.031
- There we go.
- I got you.

33:57.557 --> 33:59.037
Adam, there's something
in there.

34:07.132 --> 34:09.047
Bingo. That's it.

34:09.047 --> 34:11.745
Son of a bitch,
he cleaned it off.

34:11.745 --> 34:14.617
Well, maybe not enough.
All we need is a trace, right?

34:17.272 --> 34:18.665
Be careful.
Watch your step.

34:18.665 --> 34:20.188
That's Richard. We gotta go.

34:28.631 --> 34:32.113
So can I shoot first?

34:32.113 --> 34:34.333
Yeah, you got it.

34:34.333 --> 34:35.595
Now...

34:39.468 --> 34:40.948
You remember what to do?

34:40.948 --> 34:42.819
Yeah, sure.

34:50.784 --> 34:53.308
Come on. Let's go.

35:15.200 --> 35:17.071
Yeah.
Thanks for rushing it, Stan.

35:17.071 --> 35:18.159
Yeah.
- Tell me we're good.

35:18.159 --> 35:19.421
We're great.

35:19.421 --> 35:21.728
Techs found Dale
and Chan Rae's DNA.

35:21.728 --> 35:23.208
Blood seeped into the handle.

35:23.208 --> 35:25.297
Don't clean what you can't see.
- His luck just ran out.

35:25.297 --> 35:26.602
Officer, we good?
- All quiet.

35:26.602 --> 35:28.169
All right.

35:31.651 --> 35:34.393
- Oh, damn it.
- Garcia, get a doctor in here.

35:34.393 --> 35:36.569
- Hey, hey, I need help.
- You stupid son of a bitch.

35:36.569 --> 35:37.744
There's an emergency.

35:37.744 --> 35:39.267
You don't get to die
like this, man.

35:39.267 --> 35:41.095
You don't get to die like this.

35:41.095 --> 35:42.488
Stop moving. Just chill out.

35:42.488 --> 35:44.142
I failed him.

35:44.142 --> 35:46.318
This is what he wanted.
- Come on, man.

35:46.318 --> 35:48.929
For God's sakes, Dale,
do not die for that, man.

35:48.929 --> 35:50.583
All right, give him up
to me right now.

35:50.583 --> 35:52.150
Dale, come on.

35:52.150 --> 35:53.194
Don't let it happen like this.

35:53.194 --> 35:54.761
Give me Richard right now.

35:54.761 --> 35:57.851
Dale, you're gonna give me
Richard right now, man.

35:57.851 --> 35:59.157
Dale, give me Richard
right now.

35:59.157 --> 36:00.375
We need a crash cart.
Come on.

36:00.375 --> 36:01.594
You gotta move here.
- Come on, man.

36:01.594 --> 36:02.769
- Come on. We got him. Move.
- Dale.

36:02.769 --> 36:03.857
Dale.
- Move.

36:03.857 --> 36:04.901
Adam.

36:25.226 --> 36:28.229
Dale flatlined
20 minutes ago.

36:28.229 --> 36:29.361
What are you talking about?

36:29.361 --> 36:31.276
Took the screw
out of the IV post.

36:31.276 --> 36:33.321
Reopened his wound, bled out.

36:35.541 --> 36:38.283
I just don't know.

36:38.283 --> 36:41.024
The man would have let me
shoot him in the face.

36:41.024 --> 36:42.635
It's what Richard wanted.

36:42.635 --> 36:45.942
I could have executed him
point blank in that basement

36:45.942 --> 36:47.248
for the cause.

36:53.515 --> 36:55.822
All right.

36:55.822 --> 36:57.040
Dale have any close family?

36:57.040 --> 36:59.173
No. No, family's all dead.

36:59.173 --> 37:00.740
Richard's really all he had.

37:00.740 --> 37:02.568
All right.

37:02.568 --> 37:04.178
I want you to get approval
to log him

37:04.178 --> 37:06.833
as a John Doe at the morgue.

37:06.833 --> 37:10.706
We'll leak that CPD found
a body at that Pullman house.

37:12.273 --> 37:14.275
Richard now thinks
you murdered a man for him.

37:14.275 --> 37:16.451
We're gonna use that
to get what we need.

37:24.764 --> 37:26.722
You good, Adam?

37:26.722 --> 37:30.726
Yeah.

37:33.251 --> 37:35.253
Do I really have a choice?

37:38.168 --> 37:40.649
We use it to end this.

38:06.849 --> 38:10.026
Guess what kind of bullets
are in this thing.

38:10.026 --> 38:11.637
You got me, bud.

38:11.637 --> 38:13.160
Hollow points.

38:13.160 --> 38:15.205
They expand
when they hit the target.

38:18.208 --> 38:20.298
- Callum.
- Boom!

38:31.570 --> 38:33.528
Sir, I need
to talk to you, please.

38:35.965 --> 38:37.140
Now.

38:41.841 --> 38:43.886
I am sick of this.

38:43.886 --> 38:45.453
Excuse me?

38:45.453 --> 38:47.934
I'm sick of playing
babysitter to your daughter,

38:47.934 --> 38:49.370
to your grandson.

38:49.370 --> 38:50.937
I'm sick of pretending
to be some happy family

38:50.937 --> 38:53.026
when I just killed a man.

38:53.026 --> 38:54.941
If you want my loyalty,

38:54.941 --> 38:57.117
if you want me to take care
of things with her,

38:57.117 --> 38:59.946
then bring me in for real.

39:17.267 --> 39:20.836
Were you at the mill
yesterday?

39:24.187 --> 39:25.232
Were you?

39:25.232 --> 39:27.365
Answer the question.

39:29.236 --> 39:31.499
Yeah.

39:31.499 --> 39:34.459
Yeah, your idiot Dale
hid his knife there.

39:36.417 --> 39:37.592
You got rid of it?

39:37.592 --> 39:39.594
I tossed it in the river.

39:39.594 --> 39:41.466
Good.

39:41.466 --> 39:45.600
I'm guessing Sam told you
about the plan,

39:45.600 --> 39:47.646
the little she knows of it.

39:49.822 --> 39:54.479
It'll begin
in three weeks on May 28th.

39:54.479 --> 39:56.698
Supplies will be
in place by then.

39:59.440 --> 40:02.661
Multiple targets,

40:02.661 --> 40:04.489
many casualties.

40:04.489 --> 40:10.843
Our message will be sent
loud and clear.

40:13.585 --> 40:16.239
You're gonna be in charge.

40:18.807 --> 40:20.418
In charge of what?

40:20.418 --> 40:22.463
Deliveries.

40:22.463 --> 40:24.378
Deliveries of what?

40:24.378 --> 40:26.902
You'll know on the day.

40:26.902 --> 40:27.947
No more for now.

40:34.040 --> 40:36.477
Your time is coming, Adam.

40:36.477 --> 40:39.219
You done good.

40:39.219 --> 40:40.742
I'm proud.

40:42.570 --> 40:44.398
But in the meantime.

40:44.398 --> 40:47.314
you have to keep Samantha
on the path.

40:47.314 --> 40:49.490
She's losing faith. I can tell.

40:49.490 --> 40:51.927
Callum is confused.

40:51.927 --> 40:56.279
You'll have to remind her
of the truth.

40:58.325 --> 41:01.067
We are making a better world.
