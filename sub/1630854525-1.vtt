00:45.000 --> 00:47.791
Ah, Christmas Eve in London!

00:47.875 --> 00:50.125
-Oh!
-Who in the world could resist it?

02:24.791 --> 02:25.958
Whoo!

03:05.125 --> 03:06.125
Yeah!

03:30.250 --> 03:31.833
Kathy, the coin!

03:33.208 --> 03:35.750
-Quick, Tim. Catch it!
-No.

03:36.666 --> 03:38.208
I-I can't see it.

03:38.291 --> 03:40.166
Oi, ratbag!

03:42.000 --> 03:45.833
Why don't you watch where you're walking,
you great clumsy lump!

03:49.666 --> 03:53.791
Sorry, Mr. Scrooge, sir.
Didn't realize it was you.

03:59.041 --> 03:59.916
Good dog.

04:04.791 --> 04:07.000
Prudence, stop licking that poor boy.

04:07.541 --> 04:10.333
You've no idea where he's been.

04:13.250 --> 04:16.583
<i>Scrooge.</i>

04:17.750 --> 04:20.291
Come now, Prudence.

04:26.291 --> 04:27.125
Bye.

04:31.833 --> 04:32.666
Uncle?

04:33.416 --> 04:36.000
Uncle Ebenezer, is that you?

04:51.333 --> 04:52.750
That was close.

04:53.458 --> 04:56.416
Uncle, it is you! I knew it.

04:56.500 --> 04:57.958
Merry Christmas.

04:58.041 --> 04:59.708
And where is she?

04:59.791 --> 05:03.000
Where's the finest lady in all of London?

05:03.083 --> 05:05.333
Prudence, girl.

05:05.416 --> 05:08.583
You grow more beautiful
with every passing year.

05:08.666 --> 05:11.666
Is Uncle Scrooge
taking good care of you, is he?

05:11.750 --> 05:14.750
You don't miss
that rotten old Jacob Marley too much?

05:15.500 --> 05:18.291
Why, I was just on my way
to your office, Uncle.

05:18.375 --> 05:19.916
What luck to run into you.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.083
Well, Harry, they say
a man makes his own luck.

05:23.791 --> 05:27.541
So I suppose I only have myself
to blame for this encounter.

05:30.541 --> 05:33.333
Out of time, Jenkins.

05:38.833 --> 05:40.375
Good girl. Oh, yes.

05:40.458 --> 05:41.416
There it is.

05:42.166 --> 05:44.500
Yeah, there's a good girl. Yes.

05:49.166 --> 05:53.000
-Care to make a donation?
-To the festive fund for the poor?

05:53.083 --> 05:57.750
-Just enough to make Christmas merry.
-Or perhaps a little bit more?

05:59.541 --> 06:01.416
Do you have a permit to perform here?

06:01.500 --> 06:04.875
We didn't know we needed one.
Did you know we needed one?

06:04.958 --> 06:08.375
I didn't know we needed one.
We didn't know we needed one.

06:08.458 --> 06:10.375
Well, now you know you need one.

06:10.458 --> 06:13.791
So pack up your trumpets,
before I call the police…

06:15.291 --> 06:18.875
…to throw you all in prison,
leaving me in peace.

06:18.958 --> 06:22.458
Good day, ladies.

06:22.541 --> 06:25.458
<i>Scrooge…</i>

06:26.041 --> 06:26.958
How rude!

06:27.041 --> 06:29.500
Uncle! Uncle!

06:29.583 --> 06:31.250
Oh, splendid.

06:31.833 --> 06:33.583
-Uh, here you go.
-Oh!

06:33.666 --> 06:36.458
Thank you very much, sir. Such generosity.

06:36.541 --> 06:40.500
Such generosity. Thank you very much, sir.

06:40.583 --> 06:41.833
Think nothing of it.

06:41.916 --> 06:44.541
Why, who would be
uncharitable at Christmas?

06:44.625 --> 06:46.875
Who indeed.

06:46.958 --> 06:49.125
Uncle. Wait for us!

06:51.000 --> 06:54.416
I swear I had your money in hand
yesterday, Mr. Scrooge.

06:54.500 --> 06:59.833
It's just that my mother, she got sick,
you see, and I had to pay for a doctor.

06:59.916 --> 07:04.208
Another fascinating story, Jenkins.
But here's a better one.

07:04.708 --> 07:06.208
Once upon a time,

07:06.291 --> 07:08.333
Tom Jenkins, that's you,

07:08.416 --> 07:13.500
owed me, Ebenezer Scrooge, 25 pounds.

07:13.583 --> 07:18.708
Jenkins paid the money in full,
and Scrooge lived happily ever after.

07:19.333 --> 07:20.458
The end.

07:20.541 --> 07:25.333
Oh, come on now, Mr. Scrooge, sir.
I don't have it right now,

07:25.416 --> 07:29.833
but I'm sure I can scrape it together
in another three, four days.

07:29.916 --> 07:31.083
Five. A week.

07:31.166 --> 07:34.250
-Come on, it is Christmas after all.

07:35.666 --> 07:36.500
Louder.

07:37.083 --> 07:37.958
Faster!

07:38.458 --> 07:40.041
-He's rubbish.

07:40.125 --> 07:44.916
Christmas? Really? If only I'd known.
This changes everything.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.333
Very well, in the spirit of the season,

07:47.416 --> 07:51.041
Mr. Tom Jenkins, you now have
until the end of Boxing Day to pay me.

07:51.541 --> 07:53.583
Two extra days. How does that sound?

07:54.250 --> 07:56.416
Two days is better than nothing,
I suppose.

07:56.500 --> 08:00.458
Thank you very much, Mr. Scrooge.
Most charitable indeed.

08:00.541 --> 08:02.666
Father Christmas has nothing on you.

08:02.750 --> 08:05.375
Ho ho ho, yes, quite.

08:05.458 --> 08:06.791
Now, let's see.

08:06.875 --> 08:10.916
For the inconvenience you have caused me
and the extra two days,

08:11.000 --> 08:14.958
shall we say another 25 pounds?

08:15.541 --> 08:17.750
-That would mean I owe--
-Fifty pounds.

08:17.833 --> 08:20.500
It's a good, round number,
wouldn't you agree?

08:20.583 --> 08:23.541
Well, 30 is a round number too,
Mr. Scrooge.

08:23.625 --> 08:25.916
You're right. But so is 60.

08:30.875 --> 08:34.916
When you put it that way,
50 does have a better ring to it.

08:42.833 --> 08:45.166
Do give my best to Mother Jenkins.

08:45.250 --> 08:46.625
Oh, and Tom,

08:47.375 --> 08:48.708
merry Christmas.

08:49.875 --> 08:51.708
Fifty pounds. Two days.

08:52.458 --> 08:54.250
Look out.

08:54.958 --> 08:56.125
Merry Christmas.

08:56.625 --> 09:00.291
-Scrooge.
-Hmm?

09:04.208 --> 09:06.833
I say, Mr. Jenkins.
Do you deliver?

09:07.708 --> 09:09.250
-Mr. Jenkins?

09:24.541 --> 09:26.166
Bah, humbug.

09:26.250 --> 09:29.500
Left a bit. Right a bit. Left a bit again.

09:29.583 --> 09:31.250
Up. No, up.

09:31.333 --> 09:32.250
Left.

09:32.333 --> 09:33.541
Your other left.

09:33.625 --> 09:36.541
There, perfect. You're an artist, Mickey.

09:36.625 --> 09:39.000
An artist would get paid more than a penny

09:39.083 --> 09:41.500
for every thousand posters
he sticks up, Beryl.

09:41.583 --> 09:45.791
You there. Yes, you. Who are you?
What do you think you're doing?

09:45.875 --> 09:47.333
Who, us?

09:47.416 --> 09:50.708
Sir, we is nothing
but a bunch of poor, homeless urchins

09:50.791 --> 09:52.791
trying to make our way in the world.

09:54.833 --> 09:55.666
Quick. Leg it!

09:58.208 --> 10:02.250
Merry Christmas!

10:02.333 --> 10:03.416
Blooming children.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.708
-Mr. Scrooge. Oh dear.

10:08.791 --> 10:11.375
Welcome back, sir.
There's something I should tell you.

10:11.458 --> 10:14.166
The cost of that ink
will be deducted from your pay.

10:14.250 --> 10:17.416
What? The ink?
Oh. Oh, the ink. Of course, sir, yes.

10:17.500 --> 10:19.416
Get on with your work, Cratchit.

10:19.500 --> 10:21.958
-If it's not too much of an inconvenience.
-But, sir--

10:22.041 --> 10:24.541
-I do not wish to be disturbed.
-Yes.

10:24.625 --> 10:26.916
I've had more than my fill
of people for one…

10:27.000 --> 10:28.375
-…day.

10:32.458 --> 10:34.958
-We win!
-How in the world did you…?

10:35.041 --> 10:37.625
-Prudence knows a shortcut, don't you?

10:37.708 --> 10:41.041
Very well, let's get this over with then,
shall we?

10:41.125 --> 10:44.041
How does it go again?
Oh, yes, yes, the question.

10:44.125 --> 10:47.458
"Uncle, won't you join me
for Christmas dinner tomorrow?"

10:47.541 --> 10:48.500
The answer,

10:49.000 --> 10:51.583
"No, Harry, I will not."

10:51.666 --> 10:57.458
"Christmas is a humbug.
I despise it and all it stands for."

10:58.125 --> 11:01.416
The same answer to the same question
you ask me every year.

11:01.500 --> 11:03.416
I have no time to be merry.

11:03.500 --> 11:07.625
Just because my partner is dead doesn't
mean I have no business to attend to.

11:07.708 --> 11:11.708
Quite the opposite. Jacob Marley died
seven years ago this very night,

11:11.791 --> 11:14.083
leaving me nothing but business.

11:14.666 --> 11:16.583
Oh, yes, and you.

11:16.666 --> 11:20.500
Oh, come now, Uncle.
Hela and I would just love to have you.

11:20.583 --> 11:22.375
Hela? Who's Hela?

11:22.458 --> 11:24.333
You know, Hela, my wife.

11:24.416 --> 11:26.875
She was disappointed
you couldn't attend the wedding,

11:26.958 --> 11:29.375
and simply can't wait to meet you.

11:29.458 --> 11:32.125
So at least visit us this evening.

11:32.208 --> 11:34.833
Some friends and I
are gathering to toast the season.

11:35.583 --> 11:36.833
Good day, Harry.

11:39.291 --> 11:44.166
Uncle, I'm all the family you have.
Why does it have to be this way?

11:44.250 --> 11:47.083
I think Mother
would have been so disappointed

11:47.166 --> 11:49.666
that you and I
spend every Christmas apart.

11:57.750 --> 12:02.708
Harry, life is full of disappointments.

12:02.791 --> 12:07.958
One such disappointment came
on the glorious Christmas Day

12:08.041 --> 12:10.458
that you stumbled into this world.

12:11.166 --> 12:14.333
The very same Christmas Day your mother,

12:14.416 --> 12:17.208
my beloved sister, left it.

12:18.791 --> 12:21.500
I will not be joining you
for Christmas dinner,

12:21.583 --> 12:24.416
nor any other celebration
of this wretched season.

12:24.500 --> 12:27.958
Now, please leave
before I say something you will regret.

12:38.375 --> 12:41.291
<i>Scrooge.</i>

12:43.750 --> 12:47.416
My offer still stands.
You are always welcome, Uncle.

12:47.500 --> 12:50.875
-Goodbye!
-Merry Christmas, Prudence.

12:51.541 --> 12:53.791
-Bob.
-Merry Christmas, sir.

12:58.416 --> 13:00.416
Festive, ain't it?

13:05.208 --> 13:10.541
Excuse me, sir,
but it's almost 6:00. Six o'clock.

13:11.708 --> 13:13.625
Could I trouble you for my wages, please?

13:14.458 --> 13:16.458
Cratchit, Cratchit, Cratchit…

13:18.708 --> 13:21.125
you do nothing but trouble me.

13:21.208 --> 13:24.291
-Yeah.

13:24.375 --> 13:27.666
Five, 10, 15 shillings.

13:27.750 --> 13:30.250
-Thank you, sir.
-Take away five.

13:30.333 --> 13:32.500
But I'm owed 15.

13:32.583 --> 13:35.375
Consider the other five
your payment to me.

13:35.958 --> 13:38.375
-For what, sir?
-The ink, of course.

13:38.458 --> 13:41.416
And the day off
you insist on taking tomorrow.

13:41.500 --> 13:44.166
Well, sir, it is Christmas.

13:45.333 --> 13:48.250
Yes, as everyone is so fond of telling me.

13:48.875 --> 13:52.208
Sir, this isn't enough.
My family, you see, my children…

13:52.291 --> 13:54.208
My… My boy needs medicine.

13:54.291 --> 13:55.375
You have children?

13:55.875 --> 13:57.083
Of course you do.

13:57.583 --> 14:03.708
Cratchit, times are hard.
And my financial burdens are considerable.

14:03.791 --> 14:08.375
Now should I add to them by paying
for the upkeep of your entire family?

14:08.458 --> 14:11.458
-<i>Scrooge…</i>
-Does that sound fair to you?

14:11.541 --> 14:12.416
No, sir.

14:12.500 --> 14:16.750
No, sir, indeed.
Now, let's get you on your way, shall we?

14:16.833 --> 14:21.000
-Merry Christmas, Mr. Scrooge.
-Yes, yes. Ding-dong, merrily.

14:22.458 --> 14:24.833
I expect you
at half past seven on Boxing Day.

14:26.625 --> 14:28.416
What? What have I done now?

14:35.666 --> 14:40.083
Why, if it isn't the amazing
and wonderful Cratchit children!

14:40.166 --> 14:41.208
Father!

14:43.333 --> 14:46.083
-Tim!
-Father, help!

14:46.166 --> 14:50.083
It's all right, my little man.
Just breathe, slowly.

14:51.666 --> 14:53.083
He's getting worse.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.875
That's it. There you go.

14:59.916 --> 15:03.250
Right, you two.
That's it, no more busking tonight.

15:03.333 --> 15:07.625
It's freezing out here,
and you need your rest, young man.

15:07.708 --> 15:08.583
Aw.

15:08.666 --> 15:13.791
-But we've only made ten pence ha'penny.
-Ten pence ha'penny? A bumper windfall!

15:13.875 --> 15:17.583
If we add that to the ten shillings
I happen to have in my pocket

15:17.666 --> 15:19.875
and throw in a bit of Cratchit magic,

15:19.958 --> 15:24.791
I reckon we can have as fine a Christmas
as the Lord Mayor himself.

15:24.875 --> 15:26.750
-Yay!
-Just wait and see.

15:44.583 --> 15:46.500
Oh, don't be so dramatic.

15:46.583 --> 15:49.916
I'll pick up a juicy bone for you
on the way home. How does that sound?

15:51.000 --> 15:54.791
-The butcher owes me seven pounds six…

15:55.708 --> 15:57.750
…so I'm sure he'll be happy to oblige.

16:02.916 --> 16:06.208
<i>Scrooge…</i>

16:07.291 --> 16:08.125
No?

16:08.625 --> 16:10.291
No pleasing some people.

16:16.291 --> 16:20.041
You there. What do you think
you're doing?

16:25.583 --> 16:27.000
Oh, bravo!

16:27.500 --> 16:28.750
There you go.

16:28.833 --> 16:30.083
Merry Christmas.

16:51.416 --> 16:52.458
You two!

16:53.083 --> 16:53.916
Clear off!

16:54.541 --> 16:55.583
Disgusting.

16:57.375 --> 17:01.291
<i>Ebenezer Scrooge…</i>

17:52.666 --> 17:53.500
Tell me.

17:58.041 --> 17:59.500
There you go, sir.

18:22.791 --> 18:24.625
<i>Scrooge.</i>

19:25.833 --> 19:26.833
Tell me!

19:26.916 --> 19:27.875
Ahh!

19:35.541 --> 19:39.625
<i>Ebenezer Scrooge.</i>

19:40.708 --> 19:44.708
<i>Ebenezer Scrooge.</i>

19:46.125 --> 19:49.666
<i>Ebenezer Scrooge.</i>

20:45.000 --> 20:48.916
Ebenezer Scrooge.

20:58.291 --> 21:00.208
J-J-J-Jacob Marley?

21:01.166 --> 21:03.458
Impossible. You're dead.

21:04.041 --> 21:05.000
Dead?

21:05.791 --> 21:08.666
Dead tired!

21:08.750 --> 21:09.875
-Oh.

21:14.875 --> 21:17.333
Oh, yeah. How embarrassing.

21:19.166 --> 21:23.500
-Prudence. Oh, how well you look.

21:23.583 --> 21:26.125
I knew leaving you
in the care of Uncle Scrooge

21:26.208 --> 21:29.041
was the right thing to do, hmm? Didn't I?

21:29.125 --> 21:32.666
Hmm? Yes, I did. I did.

21:33.833 --> 21:36.916
I do apologize
for the dramatic entrance, old boy.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.500
Those in charge
insist on a touch of pageantry.

21:40.583 --> 21:42.291
Goes with the territory, you see.

21:42.791 --> 21:46.958
But I'm sure you and I can discuss
the rest like reasonable men.

21:48.750 --> 21:52.375
Ah, I must have drifted off by the fire.

21:53.000 --> 21:53.875
I'm dreaming.

21:54.416 --> 21:58.458
Serves me right
for eating cheese so close to bedtime.

21:59.833 --> 22:00.833
Well,

22:00.916 --> 22:02.041
very well.

22:16.791 --> 22:18.083
Ye gods!

22:18.166 --> 22:20.166
Listen well, Scrooge.

22:20.666 --> 22:22.291
This is no dream.

22:22.375 --> 22:25.041
Look upon the chain that binds me.

22:25.125 --> 22:29.916
In life, I forged it,
link by link, yard by yard.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.833
It grew to match my greed.

22:32.916 --> 22:36.541
In death, I will never be rid of it.

22:36.625 --> 22:38.541
Nor will you yours.

22:38.625 --> 22:40.166
Mine?

22:40.250 --> 22:41.916
Yes, yours.

22:55.833 --> 22:57.708
We were all like you.

22:58.208 --> 23:01.500
Trapped in our own selfish worlds.

23:01.583 --> 23:04.416
We never reached out
to our fellow men in life,

23:04.500 --> 23:07.625
so are condemned to do so in death.

23:08.208 --> 23:11.625
We have watched you many a day, Scrooge.

23:11.708 --> 23:16.875
Watched your chain grow,
link by link, yard by yard.

23:17.375 --> 23:21.250
But you may yet escape our fate.

23:21.875 --> 23:25.083
I have pulled a few chains

23:25.166 --> 23:29.916
and arranged for three visitors
to call on you before morning.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.125
The first, when the bell tolls 1:00.

23:33.208 --> 23:35.625
The second, at 2:00.

23:35.708 --> 23:37.208
And the third, at…

23:37.875 --> 23:40.291
Well, 3:00.

23:45.875 --> 23:49.500
Listen to these visitors. Learn from them.

23:49.583 --> 23:51.708
And heed my warning

23:52.791 --> 23:56.125
before it's too late.

24:30.416 --> 24:31.916
Jacob Marley

24:32.458 --> 24:35.458
concerned for someone else's well-being?

24:35.541 --> 24:37.708
Well, it must have been a dream.

24:43.833 --> 24:44.666
Huh?

24:52.416 --> 24:53.375
Humbug.

25:00.875 --> 25:05.500
It's that nephew of mine. Interfering.
Bringing my blood to the boil.

25:05.583 --> 25:08.500
Has me jumping at shadows.
Seeing things. Yes.

25:08.583 --> 25:10.000
That's it. Yes.

25:13.333 --> 25:15.958
<i>The first, at 1:00.</i>

25:28.375 --> 25:29.208
Hmm.

25:30.041 --> 25:31.416
Hmm.

26:22.125 --> 26:23.375
-Hello?

26:33.416 --> 26:34.583
Oh, hello.

26:34.666 --> 26:37.000
It's Scrooge, isn't it?

26:37.083 --> 26:40.541
Yes, that's the one, Scrooge.
What a funny name.

26:40.625 --> 26:42.750
Are you comfortable down there, Scrooge?

26:42.833 --> 26:44.958
Uh, well…

26:45.041 --> 26:46.375
Never mind that.

26:46.875 --> 26:50.208
Who, or what, are you?

26:50.791 --> 26:53.291
And it's "Mr. Scrooge," if you please.

26:53.375 --> 26:56.750
Well, Mr. Scrooge-if-you-please, who am I?

26:56.833 --> 27:00.833
I can be anyone you have ever known.
I can even be you.

27:03.166 --> 27:05.166
Bah, humbugs.

27:05.250 --> 27:07.083
Christmas is an outrage.

27:07.166 --> 27:09.208
Grr, give me your money.

27:09.291 --> 27:12.166
-Interest rates, and so on.
-Hmm.

27:12.666 --> 27:14.250
You were not told of my coming?

27:15.125 --> 27:16.875
No? No matter.

27:16.958 --> 27:22.625
You have nothing to fear from me.
After all, your welfare is my business.

27:23.208 --> 27:27.916
Miss, to be disturbed at this hour
is hardly conducive to my welfare.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.125
Your redemption, then.

27:30.875 --> 27:33.750
You see, an old friend of yours

27:33.833 --> 27:37.625
asked me to illuminate
a thing or two for you. I--

27:37.708 --> 27:39.375
Illuminate what, exactly?

27:39.958 --> 27:43.625
I was getting to that.
You are an impatient one.

27:44.125 --> 27:47.625
I will show you the past.

27:47.708 --> 27:49.583
Christmas past.

27:49.666 --> 27:54.125
Specifically, your Christmas past. Ahh!

27:55.666 --> 27:57.250
There. Much better.

27:58.666 --> 27:59.875
I've gone mad.

28:00.708 --> 28:01.875
Mad, you say?

28:02.583 --> 28:05.500
Jacob Marley floating in my sitting room.

28:05.583 --> 28:08.875
Faces etched in frost.
Whispers in the wind.

28:08.958 --> 28:11.166
A blizzard indoors.

28:11.250 --> 28:15.208
Now you, a talking waxwork
with a wick for brains.

28:15.291 --> 28:18.458
My dreams are never this… exciting.

28:18.958 --> 28:22.916
And none of this can be real.
So, yes, I must be awake,

28:23.500 --> 28:24.833
but quite insane.

28:25.541 --> 28:30.041
Well, I may have wick for brains,
but I do think I'm real.

28:30.125 --> 28:31.208
Here.

28:31.291 --> 28:32.833
-Oh, hush now.

28:33.500 --> 28:35.583
There, did that feel real?

28:35.666 --> 28:36.958
I-I suppose it did.

28:37.875 --> 28:39.625
It hurt too.

28:39.708 --> 28:43.458
Yes, the past can hurt.
Especially yours.

28:43.541 --> 28:46.375
But it can also heal,
if you learn from it.

28:46.458 --> 28:48.916
-Now, come with me.
-Absolutely not.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.625
I refuse to go anywhere…

28:51.708 --> 28:53.333
Whee!

28:53.416 --> 28:55.500
Whoo!

28:56.166 --> 28:57.333
Yeah!

29:02.458 --> 29:03.625
No, no!

29:08.583 --> 29:10.333
Whee!

29:19.375 --> 29:21.041
Whoo!

29:32.958 --> 29:35.291
Oh, baby Scrooge!

29:38.041 --> 29:40.791
No!

29:47.750 --> 29:52.125
Whoo-hoo!

29:55.500 --> 29:57.291
Where? W-What? Who?

30:10.541 --> 30:11.666
Get off!

30:21.250 --> 30:24.375
Sorry, it does take its toll
going this far back.

30:24.458 --> 30:27.458
-Did I not warn you?
-No, you certainly--

30:27.541 --> 30:30.500
Wait, what do you mean by "back"?

30:33.875 --> 30:34.750
Huh?

30:42.291 --> 30:46.041
-What…?
-We're not quite there yet.

30:46.125 --> 30:48.166
Almost.

30:50.208 --> 30:51.416
Here we are.

30:52.583 --> 30:54.750
The past.

30:56.125 --> 30:57.958
Spooky!

31:13.875 --> 31:15.500
I know this place.

31:16.333 --> 31:19.625
It was demolished years ago.
I saw to that.

31:24.125 --> 31:25.875
You there. What day is it?

31:26.375 --> 31:28.083
I say--

31:31.708 --> 31:32.708
Ah! Oh! Oh!

31:32.791 --> 31:36.791
I wouldn't do that.
You can't interfere with anything here.

31:36.875 --> 31:40.291
And nobody can hear you.
Or see you, for that matter.

31:54.416 --> 31:57.166
-Don't fill it right to the top.
-Look!

31:59.500 --> 32:03.375
Young Ebenezer Scrooge,
hard at work on Christmas Eve.

32:03.458 --> 32:05.791
Not very festive, is it?

32:06.833 --> 32:07.666
I…

32:07.750 --> 32:09.250
I-I had no choice.

32:10.000 --> 32:14.500
You see, without the modest income
I provided, my mother and sister,

32:15.083 --> 32:16.708
th-they would have starved.

32:17.291 --> 32:20.041
-Did your father not have any money?
-My father?

32:20.541 --> 32:21.875
He was not a poor man,

32:22.375 --> 32:25.375
but the fool spent his way
into debtors' prison.

32:26.666 --> 32:28.708
Oh, I see.

32:28.791 --> 32:32.958
Debtors' prison. Terrible, terrible thing,
a debtors' prison.

32:33.875 --> 32:37.375
-What is a debtors' prison again?
-A debtors' prison is, uh…

32:38.625 --> 32:40.125
None of your business.

32:54.875 --> 32:57.958
You can't escape your past, mate.

32:58.916 --> 32:59.833
Now, look here--

33:20.958 --> 33:23.666
-Jen?

33:30.416 --> 33:32.708
My dear little sister, Jen.

33:55.708 --> 33:58.916
-Jen. Come on, breathe.

33:59.000 --> 33:59.958
Slowly.

34:00.041 --> 34:02.375
In and out.

34:03.250 --> 34:04.125
That's it.

34:06.166 --> 34:07.833
What are you doing here alone?

34:08.333 --> 34:11.458
-Does Mother know you're out?
-I wanted to give you this.

34:11.541 --> 34:13.750
I made it all by myself.

34:14.333 --> 34:18.916
-Merry Christmas, Ebenezer.
-Oh, Jen. It's Father Christmas.

34:19.500 --> 34:21.666
-He's really magnificent.

34:22.166 --> 34:24.833
Maybe you could help me
make one for you in return.

34:24.916 --> 34:27.125
Yes, please!

34:27.208 --> 34:29.541
Shall we sing
that pretty song of yours as we walk?

34:41.583 --> 34:45.125
Oh, such a sweet child.
Will she be all right?

34:45.625 --> 34:49.541
She will be. For a while, at least,
the sickness will not take her.

34:49.625 --> 34:52.125
My father paid his debts, eventually.

34:52.208 --> 34:55.291
We found the right doctor
and she was saved. But…

34:55.375 --> 34:56.583
But?

34:56.666 --> 35:00.375
She remained a delicate soul,
whom a breath might have withered.

35:00.916 --> 35:05.541
Jen died in childbirth.
My idiot nephew in exchange for my sister.

35:05.625 --> 35:10.083
A sorry transaction in any currency.
And all on Christmas Day.

35:10.166 --> 35:11.083
Christmas.

35:11.750 --> 35:13.666
Oof. Humbug.

35:14.166 --> 35:15.458
Oh, come now.

35:15.541 --> 35:18.083
Is there not one Christmas
you remember fondly?

35:18.583 --> 35:24.041
One buried, perhaps,
in a hole as deep as old Marley's grave?

35:25.291 --> 35:26.125
Hmm?

35:26.708 --> 35:28.166
-Hmm?
-Hmm.

35:30.791 --> 35:33.125
-Merry Christmas, sir.

35:35.916 --> 35:37.250
Hello, Uncle.

35:43.708 --> 35:44.916
Aha!

35:45.000 --> 35:47.125
I do believe I've found one.

35:47.208 --> 35:48.666
Mr. Fezziwig.

35:49.208 --> 35:52.875
"Fizzywig?" Why, that's almost
as silly as "Scrooge."

35:54.458 --> 35:55.625
Off we go.

35:55.708 --> 35:57.875
-A little jump forward this time.
-Wait--

36:04.041 --> 36:07.875
I'm home then.
And not before time.

36:08.750 --> 36:11.916
Very well. You have a week and no more.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.375
Or we shall both
have to find new employment.

36:15.041 --> 36:18.208
-Good day.
-Thank you very much, Mr. Scrooge.

36:18.291 --> 36:20.833
God bless ya.
And a merry Christmas when it comes.

36:20.916 --> 36:23.500
It's still the past.

36:23.583 --> 36:24.416
It is.

36:24.500 --> 36:28.416
My word, you were
a handsome chap, Scrooge.

36:28.500 --> 36:29.750
What went wrong?

36:31.875 --> 36:33.125
Ebenezer?

36:33.208 --> 36:34.666
Is that you, lad?

36:34.750 --> 36:36.791
-Mr. Fezziwig?
-It is you!

36:36.875 --> 36:38.875
Wonderful to see you, my boy.

36:38.958 --> 36:40.875
So that's Mr. Wizzyfig.

36:41.541 --> 36:46.125
Fezziwig. Yes, I used to work
in his warehouse before Marley took me on.

36:46.208 --> 36:48.208
Why didn't you keep working for him?

36:48.291 --> 36:50.875
Marley offered a position
with more security.

36:50.958 --> 36:52.666
People will always need money.

36:52.750 --> 36:56.458
If I'd stayed, I would only have been
Fezziwig's lowly apprentice.

36:56.541 --> 37:00.250
I had to better myself
before even thinking of proposing to her.

37:00.750 --> 37:01.833
Proposing?

37:01.916 --> 37:04.875
Oh, I do like a wedding.
Who's her? Where's her?

37:04.958 --> 37:05.958
Flora!

37:06.708 --> 37:07.541
Isabel.

37:09.250 --> 37:10.125
Yes, Father?

37:12.416 --> 37:13.375
-Isabel.
-Isabel.

37:14.375 --> 37:15.916
Look who I found!

37:16.000 --> 37:19.541
Ebenezer! How lovely to see you.

37:20.541 --> 37:22.333
My, you look splendid in your suit.

37:22.833 --> 37:25.958
-Although, do you mind?
-I… I…

37:27.291 --> 37:28.583
-That is…
-There.

37:28.666 --> 37:30.833
-You see…
-Perfect.

37:31.916 --> 37:32.750
Thank you.

37:35.125 --> 37:37.666
Oh, Isabel, how I love thee.

37:37.750 --> 37:42.208
With thy big slobbery face
and stinking dog breath.

37:44.708 --> 37:45.916
Oh! Oh.

37:46.416 --> 37:50.958
Uh, Ebenezer, do you have
any plans for tomorrow?

37:51.041 --> 37:54.500
-Tomorrow, sir?
-You know, Christmas Day, my boy!

37:54.583 --> 37:57.583
No, sir. My sister
is with her husband in Kent.

37:57.666 --> 38:00.125
They're expecting a child any day now.

38:00.208 --> 38:03.083
She invited me to visit,
but I had to decline.

38:03.166 --> 38:04.875
Then it's decided!

38:04.958 --> 38:08.416
You'll join us
for Christmas lunch tomorrow.

38:08.500 --> 38:09.875
I'm not sure I can.

38:09.958 --> 38:13.375
Too much still to be done, and Mr. Marley
doesn't even take the day himself.

38:13.458 --> 38:15.833
Say you'll come, Ebenezer.
It'll be such fun.

38:16.666 --> 38:18.125
Oh, look away.

38:19.208 --> 38:20.041
I, uh…

38:21.416 --> 38:22.916
I'll talk to Mr. Marley.

38:23.916 --> 38:26.958
-Did you go?
-Well, it would have been rude not to.

38:27.041 --> 38:28.291
I felt obliged.

38:29.083 --> 38:30.291
I see.

38:30.375 --> 38:31.458
See you there.

38:31.541 --> 38:33.041
But you didn't enjoy it?

38:34.416 --> 38:36.333
No. Not one bit.

38:36.416 --> 38:37.250
Hmm.

38:47.625 --> 38:50.125
-Oh my goodness.

38:51.791 --> 38:54.291
You look like you're having an awful time.

39:12.416 --> 39:13.708
Uh, yes.

41:32.291 --> 41:34.000
A delightful woman.

41:35.875 --> 41:36.791
Without her,

41:37.708 --> 41:41.166
Jen's death would have taken
an even greater toll on me.

41:41.750 --> 41:43.083
You married her, yes?

41:43.666 --> 41:45.583
No. Not quite. I--

41:45.666 --> 41:46.708
No?

41:46.791 --> 41:49.958
-I would very much like to see why not.
-No!

41:56.458 --> 41:57.458
I…

41:57.541 --> 41:59.875
I do wish you would stop doing that.

42:01.583 --> 42:03.333
Home. Finally.

42:04.416 --> 42:06.708
Well, goodbye, whatever you are.

42:07.291 --> 42:09.875
I would say it's been a pleasure,
but it hasn't.

42:11.458 --> 42:12.416
Where's my name?

42:18.250 --> 42:20.916
This is before Marley made me a partner.

42:21.000 --> 42:24.083
Ebenezer? Hello?

42:24.166 --> 42:26.250
-I'm still in the past.
-Hello?

42:26.333 --> 42:28.750
Oh, you do catch on quickly, don't you?

42:37.833 --> 42:41.458
Ebenezer? Are you there?
I brought some lunch.

42:41.541 --> 42:44.500
I see so little of you these days,
so I thought…

42:45.333 --> 42:47.833
I'm not sure what I thought.

42:52.375 --> 42:54.208
Ah, lovely Isabel.

42:54.791 --> 42:57.291
-But you said you didn't marry her?
-We are…

42:58.291 --> 43:01.875
Were merely engaged. For quite some time.

43:01.958 --> 43:05.791
I see. I thought you would have
gone back to work for Wiggyfiz?

43:05.875 --> 43:07.125
Of course not!

43:07.208 --> 43:10.791
His charity would have led to the same
ruination that befell my family.

43:10.875 --> 43:13.333
"His charity would have led
to the same ruination

43:13.416 --> 43:15.583
that befell my blah, blah, blah."

43:17.083 --> 43:20.583
I needed more security
than he could offer. We needed it.

43:20.666 --> 43:24.500
I saw them by the baker's
only a few minutes ago. Good day.

43:28.333 --> 43:32.583
Lead on, Scrooge.
Lead on. <i>Allons-y.</i>

43:34.833 --> 43:39.041
Please, Mr. Marley, sir.
This is my livelihood. My home.

43:39.125 --> 43:41.666
My family will starve. Just one more week.

43:41.750 --> 43:44.541
One more day,
and I'll have your money, I swear.

43:44.625 --> 43:47.250
You've had three weeks already.
I am sorry.

43:47.333 --> 43:50.708
No. No apologies, Ebenezer.

43:50.791 --> 43:55.916
Times are hard,
and my financial burdens are considerable.

43:56.000 --> 44:00.875
Should I add to them by paying
for the upkeep of your entire family?

44:00.958 --> 44:03.041
Does that sound fair to you?

44:03.125 --> 44:05.416
-Sir, it's Christmas Eve.
-Come on.

44:05.500 --> 44:07.416
Please, show some mercy.

44:07.500 --> 44:10.791
-Where are you taking him?
-Clear off. Go on. On your way!

44:14.750 --> 44:17.125
<i>…and my financial burdens</i>
<i>are considerable.</i>

44:17.208 --> 44:22.208
<i>Now should I add to them by paying</i>
<i>for the upkeep of your entire family?</i>

44:22.291 --> 44:24.458
<i>Does that sound fair to you, Cratchit?</i>

44:25.250 --> 44:27.916
I… I don't recall this at all.

44:28.750 --> 44:31.916
I'm not surprised.
As horrible as this situation is,

44:32.000 --> 44:34.875
I'm sure it was of great financial benefit
to you and Marley.

44:34.958 --> 44:37.500
Apart from the delightful Miss Fizzlejig,

44:37.583 --> 44:40.208
you only seem to remember encounters
where you lose money.

44:40.291 --> 44:44.541
You dwell on the bad things in life,
and then learn nothing from them.

44:44.625 --> 44:45.916
Does Cratchit know?

44:46.583 --> 44:49.416
Why would he choose to work for me?
After what I…

44:50.000 --> 44:52.250
If his father had only paid his debts…

44:53.916 --> 44:55.500
It's not my fault.

44:57.250 --> 44:58.750
Isabel.

45:01.791 --> 45:04.041
She saw all of this.

45:23.333 --> 45:24.416
Ebenezer.

45:26.333 --> 45:27.750
Can I talk to you?

45:28.416 --> 45:29.250
Alone.

45:30.458 --> 45:32.375
Not now, Isabel.

45:32.458 --> 45:34.500
I have far too much work.

45:34.583 --> 45:35.791
Later, later.

45:37.083 --> 45:39.583
I'll, uh, leave you two lovebirds to it.

45:39.666 --> 45:41.583
-Come, Boris.

45:54.416 --> 45:55.250
No.

49:40.958 --> 49:41.791
Ebenezer?

49:42.375 --> 49:43.791
Some assistance, please.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
Yes, Jacob, coming.

49:47.500 --> 49:48.541
Later, Isabel.

49:50.416 --> 49:51.250
No!

49:51.833 --> 49:53.916
There is no "later!"

49:59.833 --> 50:00.958
Goodbye, Ebenezer.

50:13.375 --> 50:17.333
Oh, look.
A wee glimpse into Isabel's future.

50:17.416 --> 50:19.625
Oh, she looks so happy.

50:19.708 --> 50:21.625
And her husband's gorgeous.

50:22.125 --> 50:27.333
That… That could have been you, I suppose.
Oh, too bad, Scrooge. Too bad.

50:27.416 --> 50:31.416
Why show me all of this now?
What's done is done. I can't go back.

50:32.041 --> 50:35.458
When we were financially secure,
I would have married her…

50:35.541 --> 50:36.500
eventually.

50:37.250 --> 50:38.333
Wouldn't I?

50:38.916 --> 50:40.208
I don't know.

50:46.583 --> 50:48.291
-Bye!

50:52.083 --> 50:53.166
Take me back.

50:54.500 --> 50:55.500
Take me back!

50:55.583 --> 50:57.375
I'm afraid I can't.

50:57.458 --> 51:00.625
There is no going back,
nor changing what has been.

51:00.708 --> 51:02.125
You said so yourself.

51:02.625 --> 51:07.083
You can't change the past,
but you can learn from it.

51:07.166 --> 51:10.625
For your own sake, I hope you do, Scrooge.

51:10.708 --> 51:12.708
-Ooh.
-No, no, no, no!

51:13.333 --> 51:16.041
Whoo! It really is time to go.

51:17.291 --> 51:18.541
Farewell, Scrooge.

51:19.125 --> 51:21.125
Farewell.

51:21.708 --> 51:24.166
No, please! Don't leave me here!

51:24.250 --> 51:25.333
I must.

51:25.416 --> 51:28.458
Ooh. I have shown you what was.

51:28.541 --> 51:31.333
Now another will show you what is.

51:31.416 --> 51:32.458
Oh. Ooh.

51:32.541 --> 51:35.125
Remember what you have seen, Scrooge.

51:35.208 --> 51:37.291
Remember. Learn.

51:37.875 --> 51:43.166
Change while you still can!

51:46.583 --> 51:48.750
<i>The second, at 2:00.</i>

52:22.625 --> 52:23.458
Hello?

52:25.500 --> 52:26.916
Is there anybody there?

52:30.666 --> 52:33.375
Strange, annoying,
candle lady thing?

52:34.083 --> 52:34.958
Hello?

52:38.208 --> 52:39.125
Huh?

53:05.250 --> 53:09.208
Who dares disturb my slumber?

53:13.666 --> 53:18.041
State thy name and business, puny mortal.

53:21.333 --> 53:23.041
I can't…

53:23.125 --> 53:24.750
I can't… I can't keep it up.

53:25.250 --> 53:26.750
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

53:26.833 --> 53:28.958
-It was her. She dared me.

53:29.041 --> 53:31.375
Oh, we do like to have fun here.

53:36.208 --> 53:37.125
Don't worry.

53:38.041 --> 53:40.166
I know who you are.

53:40.250 --> 53:43.458
Come on, bring it in,
Ebenezer Scrooge. Bring it in!

53:43.541 --> 53:46.583
-Welcome, my friend. Welcome.

53:46.666 --> 53:48.125
Welcome where?

53:48.208 --> 53:49.125
Where am I?

53:49.791 --> 53:51.166
When am I?

53:51.750 --> 53:55.541
Oh, you are in the here and now.
In the present!

53:55.625 --> 53:57.833
Isn't it just fabulous?

54:00.833 --> 54:02.416
It's fine, I suppose.

54:02.500 --> 54:04.833
From here, I can go anywhere I please.

54:04.916 --> 54:07.875
Just so long as it's happening right now.

54:07.958 --> 54:09.958
And I do so love to visit

54:10.041 --> 54:14.041
your teeny-tiny, tootsy-wootsy,
little planet at this time of year.

54:14.125 --> 54:17.625
So much love, generosity, and good cheer!

54:18.458 --> 54:23.583
Which, conversely, brings me to you.

54:23.666 --> 54:25.916
-Me?
-Yes, you.

54:28.083 --> 54:32.083
Squeezing, wrenching, grasping,
clutching, covetous you!

54:35.083 --> 54:39.625
Secret and solitary as an oyster,
you edge along the crowded paths of life

54:39.708 --> 54:41.625
keeping everyone at a distance.

54:43.000 --> 54:49.208
Why, you stopped truly living your life
so long ago, you might as well be dead.

54:49.291 --> 54:51.583
Do not presume
to tell me how to live my life.

54:52.083 --> 54:53.500
I lead a good life.

54:55.041 --> 54:56.541
I'm a good man.

54:56.625 --> 54:59.333
Ha! <i>"A good man," he says.</i>

55:00.000 --> 55:01.500
Uh, uh, uh.

56:20.083 --> 56:20.916
Whoo!

57:29.416 --> 57:31.375
Do you see the light?

57:31.458 --> 57:33.541
Can you feel it, Scrooge?

57:34.041 --> 57:37.500
Are you ready to live your life,
now, in the present,

57:37.583 --> 57:40.333
unencumbered by the weight of the past?

57:44.833 --> 57:45.916
I'm ready.

57:50.125 --> 57:53.666
I'm ready to go home. Thank you very much.

57:56.833 --> 57:57.791
Oh, really?

57:58.791 --> 58:02.625
But the fireworks.
We did a whole song and everything.

58:02.708 --> 58:06.166
Well, I'm not giving up on you yet,
Ebenezer Scrooge.

58:07.375 --> 58:09.541
Come on. Let's hit the town.

58:09.625 --> 58:12.458
Hit the town?
I'll hit something else in a minute.

58:13.041 --> 58:15.833
Dragged from pillar to post
in the middle of the night. Huh.

58:29.041 --> 58:33.083
My friends, please.
I-I would like to propose a toast.

58:33.166 --> 58:35.041
My friends, please. Oh--

58:36.458 --> 58:37.458
Oh, thank you.

58:37.541 --> 58:40.375
He really is a buffoon, that boy.

58:40.458 --> 58:42.541
There's no need to whisper.

58:42.625 --> 58:45.458
No one can hear or see you.

58:45.541 --> 58:47.541
-Lucky them.

58:47.625 --> 58:52.625
Please raise your glass
and drink to the good health and long life

58:52.708 --> 58:55.875
of my celebrated uncle, Ebenezer Scrooge.

58:55.958 --> 58:57.666
-Boo.

58:57.750 --> 59:00.375
I know. I know.

59:00.958 --> 59:02.583
But I like old Scrooge.

59:03.291 --> 59:07.500
-No, no, no. No. Come now. I do. I do.
-Why?

59:07.583 --> 59:08.416
Why?

59:09.250 --> 59:12.708
I never met my mother,
but my father spoke of her often.

59:12.791 --> 59:15.958
Of her kindness. Her generosity.

59:16.041 --> 59:18.208
It's hard to believe
that the woman he described

59:18.291 --> 59:21.583
was that old stick-in-the-mud's
little sister<i>. </i>

59:21.666 --> 59:23.583
But his sister she was.

59:23.666 --> 59:26.916
And, by all accounts,
she and my uncle were inseparable.

59:27.000 --> 59:30.208
She loved him without reservation,
and he, her.

59:30.291 --> 59:31.958
So he can't be all bad.

59:32.041 --> 59:36.583
I have to believe that somewhere
in that loathsome old carcass of his,

59:36.666 --> 59:39.916
the man my mother loved
is fighting to get out.

59:40.000 --> 59:41.708
I should like to meet him one day.

59:42.458 --> 59:47.041
Which brings me to my next toast
of the evening, to my beloved mother.

59:47.125 --> 59:50.250
As I entered the world, you departed.

59:50.333 --> 59:56.458
Here's to the Christmases we never shared,
and the sad, short one we did.

1:00:03.291 --> 1:00:05.916
Harry, my dear, sweet Harry,

1:00:06.416 --> 1:00:08.916
let's not dwell
on the sadness in our past,

1:00:09.000 --> 1:00:10.833
on those who cannot be with us.

1:00:11.333 --> 1:00:14.041
-Or refuse to be.

1:00:14.125 --> 1:00:17.708
Instead, let us celebrate
those who are here.

1:00:17.791 --> 1:00:18.958
Hear! Hear!

1:00:20.875 --> 1:00:25.458
Everyone, let us honor the past
by toasting our present.

1:00:25.541 --> 1:00:27.583
To each other. To Christmas.

1:00:27.666 --> 1:00:29.750
-To friendship.
-Hear! Hear!

1:00:29.833 --> 1:00:31.791
-To friendship.
-To friendship.

1:00:32.583 --> 1:00:33.708
To friendship.

1:00:34.208 --> 1:00:35.250
Bravo!

1:00:49.083 --> 1:00:52.166
Oh, for goodness' sake,
where are we going now?

1:00:54.375 --> 1:00:57.041
May I present to you

1:00:57.125 --> 1:01:01.166
the beautiful home
of Robert Cratchit Esquire.

1:01:01.250 --> 1:01:07.250
He owes these sumptuous surroundings
to the generosity of his employer.

1:01:07.333 --> 1:01:10.166
I never knew
Cratchit had quite so many children.

1:01:10.250 --> 1:01:11.916
No? Did you ever ask him?

1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:17.375
Mmm. Pure nectar. An elixir
fit for Father Christmas himself.

1:01:17.458 --> 1:01:19.375
The stuffing's ready, Father.

1:01:19.458 --> 1:01:23.125
-And the birdie is plucked.
-Tremendous work, my dears.

1:01:23.208 --> 1:01:27.000
Roast goose with sage and onion stuffing
à la Cratchit.

1:01:27.083 --> 1:01:28.916
A legendary gourmet dish.

1:01:30.458 --> 1:01:34.708
There's one problem. I'm not sure whether
to stuff the goose with the stuffing,

1:01:34.791 --> 1:01:36.833
or stuff the stuffing with the goose.

1:01:43.625 --> 1:01:44.791
Come now, my love.

1:01:44.875 --> 1:01:47.291
It is a lean Christmas,
there's no denying that.

1:01:47.375 --> 1:01:49.625
But we have each other
and we have the children.

1:01:49.708 --> 1:01:51.958
We can still make the most of it.

1:01:52.041 --> 1:01:56.958
In fact, I do believe this will be
the best Cratchit Christmas ever.

1:01:57.041 --> 1:01:58.000
Hooray!

1:02:01.708 --> 1:02:03.208
Not another toast.

1:02:03.291 --> 1:02:07.041
If you please,
a toast to those whose generosity

1:02:07.125 --> 1:02:10.750
have made possible
tomorrow's sumptuous Christmas feast.

1:02:10.833 --> 1:02:12.708
Master Timothy and Miss Katherine,

1:02:12.791 --> 1:02:15.958
the Christmas-caroling Cratchits,
of course.

1:02:16.041 --> 1:02:18.541
And Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge.

1:02:18.625 --> 1:02:21.291
Oh! Scrooge?

1:02:21.375 --> 1:02:23.833
What are you trying to do,
spoil our Christmas?

1:02:23.916 --> 1:02:26.708
But his money paid for the goose, my dear.

1:02:26.791 --> 1:02:28.875
No, your money paid for the goose.

1:02:28.958 --> 1:02:33.208
-If you can even call that a goose.
-But he paid me the money.

1:02:33.291 --> 1:02:35.458
Because you earned it.

1:02:35.541 --> 1:02:38.291
Believe me, you earned that money, Bob.

1:02:39.500 --> 1:02:43.083
Mr. Scrooge assures me
that times are hard, my dear.

1:02:43.166 --> 1:02:45.916
Times <i>are </i>hard. For us, not him.

1:02:46.500 --> 1:02:51.750
Nonetheless, he is the founder
of our feast, and we should drink to him.

1:02:51.833 --> 1:02:52.666
Hear! Hear!

1:02:52.750 --> 1:02:55.458
The founder of our feast indeed.

1:02:55.541 --> 1:02:57.833
I'd like to give him
something to feast on.

1:02:57.916 --> 1:03:00.250
He'd have indigestion all January.

1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:10.333
Children, we shall drink
to your father.

1:03:10.416 --> 1:03:13.500
For the love and happiness he brings us.

1:03:13.583 --> 1:03:17.416
And to our Tiny Tim,
for the health we wish him.

1:03:17.500 --> 1:03:20.375
And, for the sake of your dear father,

1:03:20.458 --> 1:03:24.500
I will even drink
to that old miser, Mr. Scrooge.

1:03:24.583 --> 1:03:27.458
Long life to him and to us all.

1:03:27.541 --> 1:03:29.833
And a merry Christmas to us all.

1:03:29.916 --> 1:03:31.625
Merry Christmas!

1:03:31.708 --> 1:03:32.916
God bless us.

1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:35.333
God bless us, every one.

1:03:35.416 --> 1:03:37.708
Merry Christmas!

1:03:37.791 --> 1:03:40.583
I think Bob Cratchit's rather fond of me.

1:03:42.458 --> 1:03:46.958
So is his wife.
Couldn't you tell?

1:03:47.041 --> 1:03:51.666
And now, to the triumphant
musical climax of this celebration.

1:03:51.750 --> 1:03:55.208
Master Timothy, Miss Katherine,
would you be so kind?

1:03:56.125 --> 1:03:57.833
-No.
-Sing, sing!

1:03:57.916 --> 1:04:00.125
Go on, love. Sing, sing!

1:04:00.208 --> 1:04:01.541
It's embarrassing.

1:04:01.625 --> 1:04:02.625
Sing!

1:04:02.708 --> 1:04:04.375
I will if Kathy does.

1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:27.083
Timmy.

1:05:29.083 --> 1:05:32.208
Oh, just breathe. Slowly. That's it.

1:05:32.291 --> 1:05:33.833
-That's it.

1:05:33.916 --> 1:05:34.791
There we go.

1:05:36.458 --> 1:05:37.291
Slowly.

1:05:54.000 --> 1:05:55.541
Bob's boy, Tim.

1:05:57.291 --> 1:05:58.500
What will become of him?

1:05:59.083 --> 1:06:02.791
The future is as much a mystery to me
as it is to you.

1:06:02.875 --> 1:06:05.000
I can only show you what is.

1:06:05.583 --> 1:06:08.666
What's to come if you do not change?

1:06:08.750 --> 1:06:13.625
Well, that will soon be revealed
by… someone else.

1:06:29.500 --> 1:06:31.541
Oh, excuse me.

1:06:32.291 --> 1:06:35.875
Look, friend, there really is
no great secret to any of this.

1:06:36.458 --> 1:06:40.208
You just have to do
the best you can with the time you have.

1:06:40.791 --> 1:06:42.708
But you better get started soon.

1:06:43.583 --> 1:06:47.875
Because before you know it,
all that time you think you have

1:06:48.541 --> 1:06:50.541
will run out.

1:06:56.291 --> 1:06:58.625
<i>The third, at 3:00.</i>

1:07:12.958 --> 1:07:17.208
Well, goodbye, Ebenezer Scroo…

1:07:17.291 --> 1:07:18.666
Ooh!

1:07:19.708 --> 1:07:21.083
Would you look at that?

1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:42.625
-I, uh…

1:08:45.333 --> 1:08:47.250
We are no longer in the present.

1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:49.125
This is the future.

1:08:49.875 --> 1:08:51.791
This is what is yet to come.

1:08:53.958 --> 1:08:55.750
Are you still in there, giant?

1:08:56.250 --> 1:08:59.625
The fellow in the green robes?
Liked life and so forth?

1:09:01.125 --> 1:09:01.958
No.

1:09:02.541 --> 1:09:05.375
You are something else entirely.

1:09:06.333 --> 1:09:07.833
You don't speak?

1:09:07.916 --> 1:09:10.791
Your colleagues were
rather fond of speaking.

1:09:11.375 --> 1:09:12.875
More than I would have liked.

1:09:13.958 --> 1:09:19.916
So you are the one that will show me
what awaits if I do not change my ways.

1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:20.833
Yes?

1:09:24.583 --> 1:09:26.333
So I should change, should I?

1:09:27.166 --> 1:09:28.666
Why? Tell me.

1:09:29.375 --> 1:09:31.291
I live my life as well as I can.

1:09:32.291 --> 1:09:35.125
I have my faults, but who does not, truly?

1:09:35.958 --> 1:09:39.333
Are all others
I've been shown this night without blame?

1:09:39.416 --> 1:09:42.125
Am I the only one
with the power to change my life?

1:09:42.208 --> 1:09:44.000
To change the lives of others?

1:09:44.791 --> 1:09:46.958
Well? Am I?

1:09:48.708 --> 1:09:49.541
Tell me!

1:09:52.375 --> 1:09:53.708
Oh, very well.

1:09:53.791 --> 1:09:55.041
Lead on.

1:09:55.541 --> 1:09:58.583
Show me what bleak future
my wickedness has wrought.

1:09:59.083 --> 1:10:02.500
And, yes, nobody can see
or hear me, I know.

1:10:09.333 --> 1:10:11.416
Ladies and gentlemen,

1:10:11.500 --> 1:10:16.083
good morning to you
on this joyous Christmas Day.

1:10:16.583 --> 1:10:21.125
We are gathered here as a group,
united by a common bond.

1:10:21.833 --> 1:10:24.791
Namely, our feelings of gratitude

1:10:24.875 --> 1:10:29.041
to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge.

1:10:29.125 --> 1:10:30.958
-I know that fellow.

1:10:31.041 --> 1:10:34.083
Jenkins. Owes me 25… No, 50 pounds.

1:10:34.166 --> 1:10:37.916
I must say he looks uncommonly happy
for a man so deep in debt.

1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:41.291
In fact, most of this rabble
owes me money.

1:10:41.375 --> 1:10:43.000
Shush. Shush.

1:10:43.083 --> 1:10:45.416
While we are all deeply moved,

1:10:45.500 --> 1:10:49.958
those of us who Mr. S was so kind
as to lend money to over the years

1:10:50.041 --> 1:10:54.583
are particularly grateful
for what he has done for us today.

1:10:54.666 --> 1:10:56.625
-What have I done?

1:10:56.708 --> 1:10:58.541
Certainly not forgiven their debts.

1:10:58.625 --> 1:10:59.833
As your predecessor said,

1:10:59.916 --> 1:11:02.875
you are showing me
what will happen if I do not change.

1:11:02.958 --> 1:11:06.375
I did not change, yet I am celebrated.

1:11:06.458 --> 1:11:07.791
And rightly so.

1:11:07.875 --> 1:11:11.958
These creatures have finally
come to their senses. That's it. Ha!

1:11:12.916 --> 1:11:16.125
It would seem the ordeal
to which I have been subjected

1:11:16.208 --> 1:11:18.208
has been a complete waste of my time.

1:11:18.291 --> 1:11:20.791
And yours, my silent friend.

1:11:20.875 --> 1:11:23.958
No matter. All's well that ends well,
as they say.

1:11:27.416 --> 1:11:31.166
That's right, Prudence.
They're cheering for me.

1:11:31.250 --> 1:11:32.125
Yes.

1:11:35.125 --> 1:11:37.833
Ladies and gentlemen.

1:13:44.208 --> 1:13:45.750
Thank you very much!

1:13:50.291 --> 1:13:52.625
Ha, ha! Oh, yes, indeed.

1:13:52.708 --> 1:13:56.625
This is far more agreeable
than what your predecessors had me endure.

1:13:57.125 --> 1:13:58.500
So what's next, friend?

1:14:27.416 --> 1:14:28.708
Tiny Tim.

1:14:31.083 --> 1:14:32.166
-No.
-It's all right.

1:14:32.250 --> 1:14:38.208
<i>Cratchit, times are hard,</i>
<i>and my financial burdens are considerable.</i>

1:14:41.416 --> 1:14:44.708
-<i>My boy needs medicine.</i>
-<i>It's Christmas Eve.</i>

1:14:45.208 --> 1:14:48.166
<i>Cratchit,</i>
<i>you do nothing but trouble me.</i>

1:14:48.250 --> 1:14:52.958
<i>Should I add to them by paying</i>
<i>for the upkeep of your entire family?</i>

1:14:53.041 --> 1:14:54.750
I must go now, my little man.

1:14:58.416 --> 1:15:01.208
I promised your mother
I'd help with Christmas dinner, but…

1:15:01.708 --> 1:15:05.125
I'll come and see you again tomorrow.
Same time, all right?

1:15:07.333 --> 1:15:09.250
Oh, dear Tim.

1:15:10.416 --> 1:15:13.208
-Come on now, Father.

1:15:14.916 --> 1:15:19.208
Till tomorrow then.
Sleep well, my love. Sweet dreams.

1:15:29.541 --> 1:15:30.375
I…

1:15:31.041 --> 1:15:32.625
I could have done more.

1:15:33.166 --> 1:15:35.375
I could have done something.

1:15:36.041 --> 1:15:37.208
Poor Tiny Tim.

1:15:38.666 --> 1:15:41.875
Friend, you have shown me
a Christmas yet to come

1:15:41.958 --> 1:15:46.666
that mixes great joy with greater sorrow.

1:15:49.041 --> 1:15:52.125
Tell me, is this what will be,

1:15:52.625 --> 1:15:53.958
or what may be?

1:15:54.916 --> 1:15:57.083
If I were to change,

1:15:57.750 --> 1:15:59.875
would all this still come to pass?

1:16:38.458 --> 1:16:39.291
Here.

1:16:43.041 --> 1:16:45.416
-Gentlemen, please.

1:16:45.500 --> 1:16:48.166
Sorry, Father. But you reap what you sow.

1:16:48.250 --> 1:16:50.875
Is that not what your Good Book says?

1:16:50.958 --> 1:16:54.583
I wouldn't hang about for any mourners.
Nobody's sorry to see this one go.

1:16:54.666 --> 1:16:56.916
Nobody who doesn't walk
on all fours anyway.

1:16:58.541 --> 1:17:00.291
Merry Christmas.

1:17:00.375 --> 1:17:05.083
And thank you very much.

1:17:06.458 --> 1:17:08.166
Come on.

1:17:08.250 --> 1:17:12.625
Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

1:17:25.833 --> 1:17:27.958
<i>Scrooge…</i>

1:17:31.291 --> 1:17:32.208
No.

1:17:42.625 --> 1:17:43.458
No.

1:18:10.333 --> 1:18:11.291
Spare me.

1:18:11.791 --> 1:18:13.041
Let me return.

1:18:13.791 --> 1:18:16.791
I will not become this man

1:18:16.875 --> 1:18:19.875
whose death is the cause
of such celebration.

1:18:21.791 --> 1:18:24.708
Why show me this if I am past all hope?

1:18:28.458 --> 1:18:30.208
Am I? Truly?

1:18:35.041 --> 1:18:38.666
If… If I am beyond salvation,
then so be it.

1:18:39.833 --> 1:18:42.708
But, please, the boy need not die.

1:18:43.541 --> 1:18:46.750
Not when I have it in my power
to help him.

1:18:47.291 --> 1:18:51.666
I beg of you, spare me for this reason,
if nothing more.

1:18:55.875 --> 1:19:00.666
I swear to honor Christmas in my heart
and keep it there the whole year through.

1:19:01.250 --> 1:19:04.541
I will learn from the past,
live only in the present,

1:19:04.625 --> 1:19:06.583
and strive for a better future.

1:19:06.666 --> 1:19:07.875
For all!

1:19:15.458 --> 1:19:19.916
Tell me I may yet strike the writing
from the boy's cross.

1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:23.916
Tell me
I may yet break this chain!

1:19:25.250 --> 1:19:26.208
Please.

1:19:26.291 --> 1:19:28.375
Please, tell me!

1:19:31.916 --> 1:19:33.833
No!

1:19:37.791 --> 1:19:43.125
No!

1:20:05.333 --> 1:20:09.083
No! No!
Please, no! No! Please, no!

1:20:21.208 --> 1:20:22.583
No! No!

1:20:22.666 --> 1:20:24.708
Spare me! Spare me!

1:20:24.791 --> 1:20:26.666
Please. Please!

1:20:31.125 --> 1:20:32.250
Prudence?

1:20:33.916 --> 1:20:35.166
Prudence!

1:20:36.708 --> 1:20:38.375
I'm in my bedroom.

1:20:38.958 --> 1:20:41.041
Oh, it's Prudence.

1:20:44.375 --> 1:20:46.708
Well, was I… Was I merely dreaming?

1:21:21.750 --> 1:21:23.083
-You there!
-Huh?

1:21:23.166 --> 1:21:26.291
I-I say, what day is it, my fine fellow?

1:21:26.375 --> 1:21:28.833
Um, Tuesday, I think.

1:21:28.916 --> 1:21:30.041
Ha, no.

1:21:30.125 --> 1:21:31.666
Is it Christmas Day?

1:21:31.750 --> 1:21:33.666
Well, of course it is.

1:21:36.750 --> 1:21:38.958
Takes all kinds, I suppose.

1:21:39.041 --> 1:21:41.208
It's Christmas, Prudence!

1:21:41.291 --> 1:21:44.708
-It's Christmas, and I'm alive!

1:21:45.375 --> 1:21:47.375
Wait, what time is it?

1:21:49.583 --> 1:21:52.166
I'm glad Isabel found
the happiness she deserved.

1:21:53.166 --> 1:21:54.000
Perhaps…

1:21:54.791 --> 1:21:57.666
Perhaps it's not too late
for me to find my own.

1:22:13.333 --> 1:22:16.250
-I did. I swear. I said--

1:22:16.333 --> 1:22:17.916
-Hello there.
-What?

1:22:19.791 --> 1:22:22.958
What is it?
We didn't do nothing, Mr. Scrooge.

1:22:23.041 --> 1:22:25.458
No, not yet, you haven't.

1:22:25.541 --> 1:22:29.333
I have some errands for you to run.
I can make it worth your while.

1:22:31.958 --> 1:22:32.791
Errands?

1:22:42.333 --> 1:22:44.333
Thank you, Prudence. There's a good girl.

1:22:44.416 --> 1:22:46.916
Ah, ah, ah, ahh!

1:22:48.791 --> 1:22:50.125
Mind how you go.

1:22:57.375 --> 1:22:58.791
Mr. Scrooge, sir.

1:22:59.625 --> 1:23:00.708
Almost done.

1:23:00.791 --> 1:23:05.291
Magnificent.
What wonderful children you all are.

1:23:05.375 --> 1:23:07.375
And, well, sorry to ask again,

1:23:07.916 --> 1:23:10.625
but you're sure
you managed to get everything on the list?

1:23:10.708 --> 1:23:11.541
Yes, sir.

1:23:11.625 --> 1:23:14.916
The butchers and the bakers
thought I was having a laugh.

1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:18.750
But then I gave 'em the checks.
They'll be here soon.

1:23:18.833 --> 1:23:22.500
Splendid. And you did deliver
the invitations? All of them?

1:23:22.583 --> 1:23:23.583
Of course.

1:23:24.416 --> 1:23:28.208
No guarantee they'll come, though.
It is very short notice.

1:23:28.291 --> 1:23:32.416
Quite. Uh, you are
a clever young lady, aren't you?

1:23:33.375 --> 1:23:36.875
As promised,
a gold sovereign for each of you.

1:23:38.083 --> 1:23:41.833
Boys, since it's Christmas,
I ain't even gonna take my cut.

1:23:41.916 --> 1:23:45.291
That's the spirit.
And you'll all stay for dinner, won't you?

1:23:45.791 --> 1:23:46.625
Won't you?

1:23:47.208 --> 1:23:48.708
-Yay!

1:23:48.791 --> 1:23:50.750
Ha! And help yourself to a gift.

1:23:50.833 --> 1:23:52.708
Yay!

1:23:52.791 --> 1:23:55.166
-Come on.
-I get the biggest one.

1:23:56.166 --> 1:23:57.333
Ready, Prudence?

1:25:00.333 --> 1:25:04.958
-There we go. Comfortable enough, Ethel?
-Yes. Much obliged, Mr. Scrooge.

1:25:05.041 --> 1:25:08.458
Good, good, good.
Oh, and please, call me Ebenezer.

1:25:09.208 --> 1:25:13.250
-What's all this about then?
-Tom, your debt is canceled.

1:25:15.458 --> 1:25:17.375
Merry Christmas, my friend.

1:25:17.458 --> 1:25:20.083
Oh, and give my best
to your mother, won't you?

1:25:20.166 --> 1:25:22.291
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1:25:23.375 --> 1:25:25.333
Oh, my giddy aunt!

1:25:25.416 --> 1:25:29.833
Ladies, 1,000 pounds for your fund,
this and every Christmas to come.

1:25:29.916 --> 1:25:32.791
Oh, such generosity.

1:25:34.125 --> 1:25:38.958
It's the doll from my mother's picture.
Uncle, I can't accept this.

1:25:39.041 --> 1:25:40.166
You must.

1:25:40.250 --> 1:25:44.333
It's a gift from an old fool who regrets
all the Christmases we never shared.

1:25:44.416 --> 1:25:45.583
Oh, Uncle.

1:25:45.666 --> 1:25:47.125
Thank you.

1:25:52.375 --> 1:25:55.875
-"Business partners"?
-Yes, Bob. If you'll have me, that is.

1:25:56.541 --> 1:25:59.291
Let's build a brighter future
for the Cratchits together.

1:25:59.875 --> 1:26:02.583
-What do you say?
-I say yes!

1:26:03.250 --> 1:26:05.000
God bless you, Mr. Scrooge.

1:27:00.291 --> 1:27:02.750
<i>God bless us, every one.</i>

1:27:11.125 --> 1:27:14.083
Uh! Here we go! Ha!

1:27:14.791 --> 1:27:15.625
Come on!

1:27:35.500 --> 1:27:36.375
Let's go!

1:27:39.083 --> 1:27:40.375
Come on, get up, ha!

1:28:06.583 --> 1:28:08.583
One more time, one more time!

1:28:10.708 --> 1:28:12.500
Hey, listen to me now.

1:28:28.875 --> 1:28:29.750
Stop.

1:28:52.958 --> 1:28:53.791
Ow!

1:28:54.375 --> 1:28:57.958
-Whoo!
-Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

1:29:23.125 --> 1:29:23.958
Hoo!

1:29:46.333 --> 1:29:48.000
Merry Christmas!
