Mom, are we there yet?

00:36.828 --> 00:37.955
Almost, Chris.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.039
Now remember, kids,

00:39.122 --> 00:40.749
when we get to
Mr. Quagmire's cabin,

00:40.832 --> 00:41.875
don't touch anything

00:41.959 --> 00:43.585
before I have a chance
to disinfect it.

00:43.669 --> 00:44.753
Boy, it was nice
of Quagmire

00:44.837 --> 00:46.463
to let us use
his place.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.215
This'll be much better
than that vacation we took

00:48.298 --> 00:49.842
with the Price Is Right yodeler.

00:49.925 --> 00:51.009
(yodeling)

00:51.093 --> 00:52.427
Okay, you can stop here.

00:52.511 --> 00:55.055
There's no way that microwave
cost more than 300 bucks.

00:55.138 --> 00:56.723
Stop here. Don't listen
to that fat tourist.

00:56.807 --> 00:59.226
She doesn't know how much
a microwave costs. Stop!

00:59.309 --> 01:01.645
(tuba plays sad notes)

01:01.728 --> 01:04.815
Ah, we should have gone
to Plinko like Cleveland.

01:04.898 --> 01:07.067
(laughing)

01:11.363 --> 01:12.531
(dejected):
Oh...

01:18.495 --> 01:21.790
Wow, Quagmire's got
a nice place.

01:21.874 --> 01:22.875
(sighs)

01:22.958 --> 01:25.252
This is gonna be
a relaxing weekend.

01:30.257 --> 01:32.593
(music playing)

01:37.431 --> 01:38.682
(thudding)

01:38.765 --> 01:40.100
Hey, did you hear
something?

01:40.184 --> 01:41.476
I think it came
from upstairs.

01:42.936 --> 01:45.439
(martial arts yelling)

01:54.323 --> 01:56.867
Oh... hey.

01:56.950 --> 02:00.162
Uh, this the week
you guys were coming up?

02:02.122 --> 02:03.624
Beautiful country,
isn't it, Chris?

02:03.707 --> 02:06.376
God, it is peaceful,
no question, Dad.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.337
Just be careful
'cause they got a lot

02:08.420 --> 02:09.880
of big ol' wilderness
bugs out here.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.507
(buzzing)

02:11.590 --> 02:12.674
(effeminate voice):
Oh, hey.

02:12.758 --> 02:14.092
Y'all best
be careful

02:14.176 --> 02:15.385
or I'm gonna sting you
with my stinger.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.221
Oh, no!

02:17.304 --> 02:19.640
But then I's gonna
die if I sting you.

02:19.723 --> 02:20.849
You know what?

02:20.933 --> 02:22.768
I'm not gonna sting
y'all after all.

02:22.851 --> 02:25.521
And that's my choice.
Y'all ain't worth it.

02:25.604 --> 02:27.481
I'm just gonna head on
over to that flower

02:27.564 --> 02:28.899
and suck on
that stamen

02:28.982 --> 02:31.151
like there's
no tomorrow.

02:31.235 --> 02:33.153
Brian, how many years
have I been saying

02:33.237 --> 02:34.613
you and I should
go berry-picking?

02:34.696 --> 02:35.864
A lot of years, Stewie.

02:35.948 --> 02:37.115
Wait a minute.

02:37.199 --> 02:38.575
Do you know where
we are, Brian?

02:38.659 --> 02:40.327
This is a very
special place.

02:40.410 --> 02:43.080
They say once every hundred
years in this spot,

02:43.163 --> 02:45.624
Donny Most rises
from the mist.

02:45.707 --> 02:47.000
I think that's
just a legend.

02:47.084 --> 02:49.419
That's because you're...

03:44.850 --> 03:46.226
All right,
here's a little tune

03:46.310 --> 03:49.563
inspired by one of the great
legends of the Old West.

03:49.646 --> 03:53.567

04:32.773 --> 04:34.233
And when he woke up
in the morning,

04:34.316 --> 04:35.526
she was still in his bed!

04:35.609 --> 04:37.653
(screams)

04:38.195 --> 04:39.404
That's it?

04:39.488 --> 04:40.489
Yeah.

04:40.572 --> 04:41.907
And then she wanted
to make him eggs.

04:41.990 --> 04:43.408
(screams)

04:43.492 --> 04:44.952
And he said, "Oh,
I don't have time."

04:45.035 --> 04:46.495
I've got a meeting
at 12:30."

04:46.578 --> 04:47.788
And she said, "I'll
drive you there."

04:47.871 --> 04:49.039
(screams)

04:49.122 --> 04:50.916
And he said, "No, no,
it's at my office.

04:50.999 --> 04:52.042
It's, like,
a half-hour commute."

04:52.125 --> 04:53.293
And she said,
"I don't mind.

04:53.377 --> 04:54.837
It's on the way
to my kid's preschool."

04:54.920 --> 04:58.257
(screaming)

05:03.136 --> 05:04.721
Hey, hey, Lois,
look at me.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.181
I got postpartum
depression.

05:06.265 --> 05:10.352
Wah! I'm sad
about stuff! Wah!

05:10.435 --> 05:12.896
You son of a bitch,
don't even joke about that!

05:12.980 --> 05:14.690
This water feels kind of funny.

05:14.773 --> 05:16.358
Yeah, and it smells bad.

05:16.441 --> 05:17.484
(shrieks)

05:17.568 --> 05:18.694
Dad, look!

05:18.777 --> 05:19.987
Holy crap!

05:20.070 --> 05:22.072
(all screaming)

05:23.991 --> 05:26.702
Oh, my God, what the hell
is wrong with this lake?!

05:26.785 --> 05:28.245
I think it's
a safe bet

05:28.328 --> 05:29.371
that that's
responsible.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.961
So they can just dump
their waste into the lake?

05:36.044 --> 05:37.462
This can't be legal.

05:37.546 --> 05:39.047
What kind
of world is this

05:39.131 --> 05:41.884
where you can't even trust
the oil companies anymore.

05:41.967 --> 05:43.218
Hey, you've got a tattoo.

05:43.302 --> 05:44.595
No, I don't.
Is that Ziggy?

05:44.678 --> 05:45.679
No.

05:45.762 --> 05:46.763
You have
a Ziggy tattoo?

05:46.847 --> 05:47.848
Aw, geez.

05:47.931 --> 05:49.391
Why do you have
a Ziggy tattoo?

05:49.474 --> 05:51.560
I just used to think...

05:51.643 --> 05:52.769
he was kind of funny.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.521
We should, uh, we should
get to the hospital.

05:59.401 --> 06:02.404
Mom, how long do we have
to wear these wigs?

06:02.487 --> 06:04.198
Until our hair
grows back, Chris.

06:04.281 --> 06:06.950
Dad, you couldn't have gotten us
anything more stylish?

06:07.034 --> 06:08.493
Oh, I don't think it's so bad.

06:08.577 --> 06:09.620
I feel rather like Mozart.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.413
Hey, Stewie, play Haydn.

06:11.496 --> 06:13.790
(plays tune skillfully)

06:13.874 --> 06:15.959
(all laughing)

06:16.043 --> 06:17.294
Now play Handel.

06:19.630 --> 06:22.716
(all laughing)

06:22.799 --> 06:24.176
Play Peter Griffin.

06:24.259 --> 06:27.930
Ah, now that is a challenge.

06:28.013 --> 06:30.641
(playing plodding melody)

06:32.768 --> 06:34.520
(all laughing)

06:35.979 --> 06:37.689
(farting)

06:39.316 --> 06:41.026
Go ahead, mock me.

06:41.109 --> 06:43.529
But it wasn't Stewie
who was laughing at me.

06:43.612 --> 06:44.905
It was God.

06:44.988 --> 06:48.033
(Mozart's "Requiem" plays)

06:51.036 --> 06:53.038
What can I do for you,
Mrs. Griffin?

06:53.121 --> 06:56.083
Mayor West, I'm here
as an outraged citizen.

06:56.166 --> 06:57.626
The Quahog Oil Refinery

06:57.709 --> 07:00.671
is emptying all their toxic
waste into the lake.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.798
I mean, you couldn't possibly
have sanctioned

07:02.881 --> 07:05.300
that kind of blatant
industrial pollution, could you?

07:05.384 --> 07:07.511
Yeah, I told 'em it was fine.
What?

07:07.594 --> 07:10.681
And in return,
I get free oil for my hair.

07:10.764 --> 07:13.100
Hey, baby, want
to take a gander

07:13.183 --> 07:14.810
at some Adam West penis?

07:14.893 --> 07:16.728
This is unbelievable!

07:16.812 --> 07:19.356
Well, I am not gonna stand by
while you let this town

07:19.439 --> 07:20.858
be destroyed by corruption.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.402
Mr. Mayor, I promise you this:

07:23.485 --> 07:25.487
Next election,
I'm gonna run against you

07:25.571 --> 07:27.239
and I'm gonna win.

07:27.322 --> 07:28.740
All right,
Mrs. Griffin,

07:28.824 --> 07:30.325
you want to take
me on? Fine.

07:30.409 --> 07:31.702
But if you plan
to beat me,

07:31.785 --> 07:32.786
you'll have to...
(gasps)

07:32.870 --> 07:34.246
What is it?

07:34.329 --> 07:36.123
(whispering): A bee just flew in
through the window.

07:36.206 --> 07:37.291
Don't move.

07:37.374 --> 07:38.458
(buzzing)

07:38.542 --> 07:40.836
Hmm, now look who's mayor.

07:40.919 --> 07:44.214
First order of business,
free honey for everyone.

07:44.298 --> 07:48.302
Yay, Mayor Bee, Mayor Bee!
Mayor Bee! Ow!

07:48.385 --> 07:50.095
Oh, done stung myself.

07:50.179 --> 07:52.139
Bye, world.

07:57.102 --> 07:58.645
Good evening, Quahog.
I'm Tom Tucker.

07:58.729 --> 07:59.980
And I'm Diane Simmons.

08:00.063 --> 08:02.024
The Quahog mayoral race
is heating up.

08:02.107 --> 08:04.276
with incumbent
Adam West squaring off

08:04.359 --> 08:06.069
against challenger
Lois Griffin.

08:06.153 --> 08:07.529
Which leads many
political analysts

08:07.613 --> 08:08.822
to ask the question,

08:08.906 --> 08:10.282
"Can a woman
really be mayor,

08:10.365 --> 08:12.409
or will she just
menstruate all over the city?"

08:12.492 --> 08:13.702
Stay with us.

08:16.455 --> 08:18.081
Oh, you guys,
I can't tell you

08:18.165 --> 08:20.292
how much I appreciate
all your hard work.

08:20.375 --> 08:22.544
It's really gonna make
a difference with my campaign.

08:22.628 --> 08:23.962
Hey, Lois,
take a look.

08:24.046 --> 08:26.048
I just made 500
T-shirts that say

08:26.131 --> 08:28.383
"Vote for Lois,
unless you're queer.

08:28.467 --> 08:30.344
No, wait,
even if you're queer.

08:30.427 --> 08:31.637
No Jews though.

08:31.720 --> 08:33.013
Okay, Jews."

08:33.096 --> 08:37.142
(nervously): Oh... These are
wonderful, sweetie.

08:37.226 --> 08:38.685
Chris, why don't you
put these upstairs

08:38.769 --> 08:40.562
in your closet
so we don't lose them?

08:40.646 --> 08:42.898
But the evil monkey
lives in my closet.

08:42.981 --> 08:44.733
Of course,
he hasn't been as evil

08:44.816 --> 08:46.109
since he became
a Jehovah's Witness.

08:55.744 --> 08:56.828
(doorbell rings)

08:56.912 --> 08:58.956
(door opens)
Hi, I'm going door-to-door

08:59.039 --> 09:00.916
to campaign on behalf
of Lois Griffin

09:00.999 --> 09:04.002
who's offering real change
for the city of Quahog.

09:04.086 --> 09:06.088
May we count on your vote
next Tuesday?

09:06.171 --> 09:08.298
Chris, this is our house.

09:08.382 --> 09:10.717
Ah, then what is for dinner?

09:10.801 --> 09:12.803
Pork chops.
Excellent.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.680
Chris, have you been
to any other houses?

09:14.763 --> 09:16.014
I have not.

09:16.098 --> 09:17.891
Would you like to come in?
Please.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.061
This is Tom Tucker

09:21.144 --> 09:22.729
with some breaking
election coverage.

09:22.813 --> 09:24.565
Mayor Adam West has
widened his lead

09:24.648 --> 09:26.316
over challenger Lois Griffin.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.485
I'm confident that
the people of Quahog

09:28.569 --> 09:29.945
will make the right choice.

09:30.028 --> 09:32.406
And here to help me secure
the Latino vote

09:32.489 --> 09:34.366
is actor Jimmy Smits.

09:34.449 --> 09:37.452
Adam West likes to eat food
that's grilled in foil.

09:37.536 --> 09:38.871
(all exclaiming)

09:38.954 --> 09:40.163
That's our guy.

09:43.542 --> 09:46.170
Boy, this election's
gonna be a tight one.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.422
It's probably gonna be decided
by just a couple of votes.

09:48.505 --> 09:49.840
And here we
are sitting here

09:49.923 --> 09:52.009
like a bunch of lazy,
paraplegic cops.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.802
Huh?
I'm sorry, Joe.

09:53.886 --> 09:55.179
It's just an expression.
Ah.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.347
We got to give Lois
a last-minute edge.

09:57.431 --> 09:59.933
Guys, I need you to help
out on the campaign.

10:00.017 --> 10:02.436
Oh, man, that's like
making all, like, signs,

10:02.519 --> 10:04.062
and walking around or what?

10:04.146 --> 10:06.398
You know, you bastards
got a stake in this, too.

10:06.481 --> 10:08.775
I mean, Lois is my wife,
and if she's the mayor

10:08.859 --> 10:10.777
we can pretty much do
whatever the hell we want.

10:10.861 --> 10:12.821
I could do cocaine
if I wanted to.

10:12.905 --> 10:14.448
Peter, you want
some potatoes?

10:14.531 --> 10:15.824
Yeah, how you doin'?

10:15.908 --> 10:17.117
I was just asking
if you wanted...

10:17.201 --> 10:18.243
We got enough napkins?

10:18.327 --> 10:19.536
Yeah, we got
enough napkins.

10:19.620 --> 10:20.871
That's enough.
That's enough right there.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.999
(breathes deeply):
What time is it?

10:24.082 --> 10:25.792
Is this-Is this straight?
Is this straight right there?

10:25.876 --> 10:27.711
Look, wait, see...
I'll fix it.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.838
No, no... Is this straight?
I can't tell...

10:29.922 --> 10:31.340
(screams)

10:31.423 --> 10:32.591
Meg, sweep that up.

10:32.674 --> 10:33.967
Get-Get a broom, sweep that up.
Sweep that up.

10:34.051 --> 10:35.886
Put it in your room,
but sweep it up first.

10:39.723 --> 10:43.268
Suspect number two,
he's the one who raped me.

10:43.352 --> 10:46.188
All right, all but number
two are free to leave.

10:46.271 --> 10:47.940
Ma'am, I know that
you're going through

10:48.023 --> 10:49.733
a difficult time right now,

10:49.816 --> 10:51.527
but I just have
a few more questions.

10:51.610 --> 10:52.945
Are you planning
to vote tomorrow?

10:53.028 --> 10:54.196
What?

10:54.279 --> 10:56.406
Are you aware that
Lois Griffin has a plan

10:56.490 --> 10:59.284
to cut property tax in half
over the next three years?

10:59.368 --> 11:01.495
What does that have to do
with what happened to me?

11:01.578 --> 11:03.121
Well, you say
number two did it,

11:03.205 --> 11:06.291
maybe I say I smell
alcohol on your breath.

11:06.375 --> 11:07.918
You can't do that!

11:08.001 --> 11:10.546
Sounds like Lois Griffin
can count on your vote.

11:12.089 --> 11:14.132
Hi. When you go to vote
for mayor tomorrow,

11:14.216 --> 11:15.843
please vote for Lois Griffin.

11:15.926 --> 11:17.886
That's right.
I work at a deli

11:17.970 --> 11:19.596
and I know baloney.

11:19.680 --> 11:21.348
And that's exactly
what you'll get

11:21.431 --> 11:22.933
with Mayor Adam West.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.853
Ooh, sa-nap!

11:29.106 --> 11:30.899
Boy, you guys,
I really appreciate

11:30.983 --> 11:32.192
all the help
you've been giving us.

11:32.276 --> 11:34.236
Except for you, Quagmire,
you ain't done nothing.

11:34.319 --> 11:35.779
What the hell are you
talking about?

11:35.863 --> 11:38.240
Lois is gonna get the entire
female vote 'cause of me.

11:38.323 --> 11:40.450
I've been having sex
with every woman in town

11:40.534 --> 11:42.661
nonstop for
the past two days.

11:42.744 --> 11:44.788
You know how many sperm
I got left? One.

11:44.872 --> 11:46.790
He's all alone in there
and he's scared, all right?

11:46.874 --> 11:48.709
He's scared.
Ha.

11:51.086 --> 11:54.756
Welcome, Quahog,
to the town hall mayoral debate

11:54.840 --> 11:58.552
between incumbent Adam West
and challenger Lois Griffin.

11:58.635 --> 12:01.054
We will now open up
the floor to questions

12:01.138 --> 12:03.098
from a community at large.

12:03.182 --> 12:05.642
Yes, Mrs. Griffin,
how do you feel

12:05.726 --> 12:09.062
about those computer websites
that put a blue square

12:09.146 --> 12:11.273
on the home of a sex offender?

12:11.356 --> 12:13.025
Well, the safety of our children

12:13.108 --> 12:15.694
is a very important part
of my plan for Quahog.

12:15.777 --> 12:17.696
I have a 12-point program
for the security of...

12:17.779 --> 12:19.740
(gong clashes)

12:19.823 --> 12:21.617
I'm sorry, your time is up.

12:21.700 --> 12:23.535
(crowd murmuring)

12:23.619 --> 12:25.329
No, no, no, no,
I'm not impressed.

12:25.412 --> 12:26.580
I'm not impressed,
not yet.

12:26.663 --> 12:28.540
Mayor West, if reelected,

12:28.624 --> 12:31.001
would you increase the frequency
of garbage pickup?

12:31.084 --> 12:33.086
Well, citizen,
that's an excellent question

12:33.170 --> 12:34.505
and I thank you for it.

12:34.588 --> 12:36.673
I think it's great
we live in a town

12:36.757 --> 12:38.342
where you can ask questions.

12:38.425 --> 12:39.968
Because without questions,

12:40.052 --> 12:42.095
we'd just have answers.

12:42.179 --> 12:45.349
And an answer without
a question is a statement.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.142
Oh, I like him.

12:47.226 --> 12:48.560
He looks me in the eye.

12:48.644 --> 12:49.853
(crowd murmuring)

12:49.937 --> 12:51.104
I'd like to have
a beer with him.

12:51.188 --> 12:52.189
I'm voting for him.

12:53.857 --> 12:55.776
I don't understand
these people.

12:55.859 --> 12:58.487
He didn't even say anything
and they're eating it up.

12:58.570 --> 13:00.072
Lois, undecided voters

13:00.155 --> 13:01.532
are the biggest idiots
on the planet.

13:01.615 --> 13:03.492
Try giving short,
simple answers.

13:03.575 --> 13:05.577
Sir, your question, please?

13:05.661 --> 13:09.581
Mrs. Griffin, what do you plan
to do about crime in our city?

13:09.665 --> 13:10.874
A lot.

13:10.958 --> 13:12.459
(applause, excited murmuring)
She's got my vote.

13:14.711 --> 13:17.631
Because that's what Jesus wants.

13:17.714 --> 13:19.383
(applause, excited murmuring)

13:20.467 --> 13:22.344
9/11 was bad.

13:22.427 --> 13:23.804
(cheering)

13:23.887 --> 13:25.138
I agree with that.

13:25.222 --> 13:27.474
God, I can't believe
how easy this is.

13:27.558 --> 13:29.059
Mrs. Griffin,
what are your plans

13:29.142 --> 13:30.811
for cleaning up
our environment?

13:30.894 --> 13:32.312
9/11.

13:32.396 --> 13:36.108
(cheering)

13:36.191 --> 13:38.360
Mrs. Griffin, what about
our traffic problem?

13:38.443 --> 13:39.444
Nine...

13:39.528 --> 13:40.654
(anticipated groans)

13:40.737 --> 13:41.738
Eleven.

13:41.822 --> 13:44.575
(cheering)

13:44.658 --> 13:47.619
(raucous cheering)

13:52.291 --> 13:54.334
Well, the election results
are pouring in

13:54.418 --> 13:56.170
and it looks like it's
gonna be a tight one.

13:56.253 --> 13:57.337
Which reminds me, Diane,

13:57.421 --> 13:58.922
when's the last time you...
aw, forget it.

13:59.006 --> 14:01.175
Oh, my God,
I'm an absolute wreck.

14:01.258 --> 14:02.634
Well, folks, this is it.

14:02.718 --> 14:04.303
The last of the votes
have been tallied

14:04.386 --> 14:06.388
and we're getting
the final results in now.

14:06.471 --> 14:08.557
Quahog's new mayor is...

14:08.640 --> 14:10.058
Lois Griffin.

14:10.142 --> 14:13.478
(cheering)

14:13.562 --> 14:15.439
Aah...!

14:15.522 --> 14:17.816
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Oh, God! Oh, God!

14:19.193 --> 14:20.360
Oh.

14:20.444 --> 14:21.445
Were we done cheering?

14:21.528 --> 14:22.529
Ha.

14:27.159 --> 14:29.703
Well, Mrs. Mayor,
how do you feel?

14:29.786 --> 14:31.663
Oh, I'm a little
nervous, Brian,

14:31.747 --> 14:33.165
but mostly I'm excited

14:33.248 --> 14:34.708
about all the good
I'm gonna get to do.

14:34.791 --> 14:36.001
Wow, look at you.

14:36.084 --> 14:38.378
All that power and you've
still got that body.

14:38.462 --> 14:40.464
And the first thing
I'm going to do as mayor

14:40.547 --> 14:41.757
is clean up Lake Quahog.

14:41.840 --> 14:43.592
Well, I know the people
will support you, Lois,

14:43.675 --> 14:44.843
because you connect
with them.

14:44.927 --> 14:46.929
Like Disney connects
with its audience.

14:47.012 --> 14:48.430
You da cow!

14:48.514 --> 14:50.098
No, you da cow!

14:50.182 --> 14:52.434
Wow, Disney gets us.

14:54.728 --> 14:57.564
And I think we all realize
the importance of stopping

14:57.648 --> 15:00.192
the environmental damage
being done to Lake Quahog,

15:00.275 --> 15:03.362
which is why I'm proposing
a very modest tax increase

15:03.445 --> 15:04.655
that will help us to...
(groaning)

15:04.738 --> 15:05.739
(booing)

15:05.822 --> 15:07.032
No, no, no, that's awful.

15:07.115 --> 15:08.784
No, no, no,
I'm not okay with that.

15:08.867 --> 15:10.369
No new taxes!

15:10.452 --> 15:11.995
ALL (chanting):
No new taxes!

15:12.079 --> 15:13.580
No new taxes!

15:13.664 --> 15:15.082
No new taxes!

15:15.165 --> 15:17.876
But what about the terrorists?

15:17.960 --> 15:19.044
(audible gasps)

15:19.127 --> 15:21.713
That's right, terrorists.

15:21.797 --> 15:25.467
We have intelligence
that suggests that...

15:25.551 --> 15:29.012
Hitler is plotting with...

15:29.096 --> 15:31.098
with the Legion of Doom...

15:31.181 --> 15:34.476
to assassinate Jesus...

15:34.560 --> 15:36.270
using the lake as a base.

15:36.353 --> 15:38.355
(frantic murmuring)

15:38.438 --> 15:41.650
ANNOUNCER: Meanwhile,
at the Legion of Doom...

15:41.733 --> 15:44.194
How did she discover our plan?

15:44.278 --> 15:48.073
Me, Solomon Grundy, kind of
dropped the ball on that one.

15:48.156 --> 15:51.076
And we also
have evidence that...

15:51.159 --> 15:55.122
Darth Vader tried to buy
yellowcake uranium...

15:55.205 --> 15:57.875
from unwed teenage mothers.

15:57.958 --> 15:59.877
Those things
all sound scary.

15:59.960 --> 16:01.920
How much money before
it can feel safe again?

16:02.004 --> 16:03.839
Um...

16:03.922 --> 16:05.465
a hundred thousand?

16:05.549 --> 16:07.676
(excited murmuring)

16:07.759 --> 16:08.760
I threw a ten.

16:08.844 --> 16:10.179
See that ten there?
I threw that.

16:16.059 --> 16:18.937
At the top of the news,
Lake Quahog is once again clean,

16:19.021 --> 16:21.815
thanks to the efforts of newly
elected mayor, Lois Griffin.

16:21.899 --> 16:24.443
We now go to Asian reporter,
Tricia Takanawa,

16:24.526 --> 16:25.861
for her slant on the story.

16:25.944 --> 16:27.029
Thanks, Tom.

16:27.112 --> 16:28.864
Once again, happy locals

16:28.947 --> 16:31.200
are frolicking in the waters
of Lake Quahog.

16:31.283 --> 16:33.493
And we're here
with their reactions.

16:33.577 --> 16:35.996
Sir, how does it feel
to have the lake back?

16:36.079 --> 16:38.123
Well, I'll tell you, Tricia,
as a local resident,

16:38.207 --> 16:39.583
I feel like I can
once again

16:39.666 --> 16:41.251
take pride
in my community.

16:41.335 --> 16:42.836
I think this is really
gonna revitalize tourism.

16:42.920 --> 16:43.921
And--

16:44.004 --> 16:45.005
And if you look around,

16:45.088 --> 16:47.382
I think even the wildlife
is starting to come back.

16:47.466 --> 16:49.301
And, you know, that's something
we haven't seen in a while.

16:49.384 --> 16:50.761
I think we're going to be
seeing a lot more of that.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.262
Hey, you guys.

16:52.346 --> 16:55.849
Mom, everyone on TV says
you're running the town great.

16:55.933 --> 16:58.310
Maybe you can do some
damn laundry once in a while.

16:58.393 --> 16:59.478
What?
What?

16:59.561 --> 17:01.855
Wow, Mom, is that
a new purse?

17:01.939 --> 17:03.357
Yeah, that looks pretty
expensive.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.776
Well, don't tell anybody, Brian,

17:05.859 --> 17:07.861
but I was a little naughty.

17:07.945 --> 17:09.947
I may have dipped into
the tax surplus.

17:10.030 --> 17:11.657
Wait a minute,
you used taxpayer money

17:11.740 --> 17:13.325
to buy yourself a handbag?

17:13.408 --> 17:15.285
It's no big deal, Brian.

17:15.369 --> 17:18.288
Besides, there was a lot left
over after the lake cleanup

17:18.372 --> 17:21.667
and I figured maybe I earned
a little treat, huh?

17:21.750 --> 17:24.503
Lois, spending even one penny
of that money on yourself

17:24.586 --> 17:25.629
is incredibly unethical.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.923
Oh, come on,
it was only $600.

17:28.006 --> 17:29.716
My God, that's more than I spent

17:29.800 --> 17:31.844
to go see that prizefight
in Vegas.

17:31.927 --> 17:34.596
I thought you said we was
going to see Hairspray.

17:34.680 --> 17:36.223
Bitch, I thought
I said just shut up

17:36.306 --> 17:37.683
and be lookin' fine.

17:43.480 --> 17:45.399
What the hell's up with
these rolling blackouts?

17:45.482 --> 17:46.942
Well, since Lois
is the mayor,

17:47.025 --> 17:48.944
I'm allowed to reroute
all the town's electricity.

17:49.027 --> 17:50.153
What'd you do that for?

17:50.237 --> 17:52.531
So I could reanimate
the corpse of Jim Varney.

17:52.614 --> 17:53.991
Howdy, Vern.

17:54.074 --> 17:56.618
This is some dad-gum nice
house you got here, Vern.

17:56.702 --> 17:58.328
That's Vern, V-Vern,
Vern, Vern.

17:58.412 --> 18:01.832
Oh, wait, wait, it was John
Belushi, that's who I wanted.

18:01.915 --> 18:03.709
Peter, how could you...?
Way ahead of you, Brian.

18:03.792 --> 18:05.544
My mistake,
I'll take care of this.

18:07.588 --> 18:09.464
Hey, Jim, come out
in the yard,

18:09.548 --> 18:11.800
will ya?
Sure thing, Vern.

18:14.803 --> 18:16.013
(gunshot)

18:16.805 --> 18:17.806
He got the shotgun, Brian!

18:17.890 --> 18:19.057
Don't ask me
how he did it,

18:19.141 --> 18:20.350
but Jim Varney
got the shotgun!

18:20.434 --> 18:21.435
Run for your life!
What?!

18:21.518 --> 18:22.519
Run!

18:29.735 --> 18:31.904
Excuse me, how much
is this coat?

18:31.987 --> 18:33.155
It's $4,300.

18:33.238 --> 18:34.406
Oh.

18:34.489 --> 18:35.866
Do you think
you can give me

18:35.949 --> 18:37.618
a little mayoral discount?

18:37.701 --> 18:40.204
Well, I think you're doing
a great job, Mrs. Griffin,

18:40.287 --> 18:41.580
but my boss would kill me.

18:41.663 --> 18:42.664
How's everything
going out here?

18:42.748 --> 18:44.041
Fine, Mr. Voorhees.

18:44.124 --> 18:46.585
Good. 'Cause if you
screw up, I'll kill ya.

18:46.668 --> 18:48.837
Hi. Bob Grossbeard,
Quahog Oil.

18:48.921 --> 18:50.797
I'd like to buy you
that coat.

18:50.881 --> 18:52.174
Really?

18:52.257 --> 18:54.968
All I ask in return
is that you let my company

18:55.052 --> 18:57.054
do just a little bit
of dumping in your lake.

18:57.137 --> 18:58.764
This guy don't sit
right with me, Lois.

18:58.847 --> 19:00.057
He don't sit right with me.

19:00.140 --> 19:02.851
But I just cleaned
up Quahog Lake.

19:02.935 --> 19:04.728
Do you want
the coat or not?

19:08.774 --> 19:09.816
I want the coat.

19:09.900 --> 19:10.901
Excellent.

19:10.984 --> 19:12.694
Then we have a deal.

19:12.778 --> 19:15.989
Ugh, Brian's gonna be really
upset when he finds out.

19:16.073 --> 19:18.200
Eh, I'll just take him
for a ride in the car,

19:18.283 --> 19:19.326
he'll forget all about it.

19:20.911 --> 19:22.162
(sniffing)

19:22.246 --> 19:23.789
Wait a minute,
I know where we are.

19:23.872 --> 19:24.957
The park is near here.

19:25.040 --> 19:26.208
We're near the park, Lois.

19:26.291 --> 19:28.710
Oh, that's the tree.
I peed on that.

19:28.794 --> 19:30.587
Hey. Hey, Lois. Lois.

19:30.671 --> 19:31.797
There's another dog in that car.

19:31.880 --> 19:33.131
H-Hey, hey, hey!

19:33.215 --> 19:34.675
There's another dog
in that car. Hey!

19:34.758 --> 19:36.426
Are you seeing that?!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

19:36.510 --> 19:38.804
Other dog, (bleep) you!

19:41.390 --> 19:44.977
Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf
of the Quahog Oil Refinery,

19:45.060 --> 19:47.479
we would like to thank
Mayor Lois Griffin

19:47.563 --> 19:49.356
for our newest waste pipe.

19:53.694 --> 19:56.488
Let the dumping resume.

20:02.870 --> 20:05.789
Hey, Jake, how long can you
hold your breath under water?

20:05.873 --> 20:07.499
Longer than you.
Check it out.

20:10.502 --> 20:12.045
(screams)

20:12.129 --> 20:13.505
Aah! My face!

20:13.589 --> 20:16.175
(screaming)

20:21.096 --> 20:22.890
Lois, what the hell
are you doing?

20:22.973 --> 20:25.684
Remembering who I am,
you crook.

20:25.767 --> 20:27.436
Oh, I'm a crook, am I?

20:27.519 --> 20:29.271
What about all the money
you embezzled?

20:29.354 --> 20:31.648
You want people to
find out about that?

20:31.732 --> 20:34.610
You better play ball, or we'll
find someone else who will.

20:34.693 --> 20:36.236
I'll play ball.

20:36.320 --> 20:37.696
You know what,
West?

20:37.779 --> 20:39.281
You can have
your job back.

20:39.364 --> 20:42.159
Politics does terrible things
to good people.

20:42.242 --> 20:43.285
Good for you, Lois.

20:43.368 --> 20:45.162
You wised up before
it was too late.

20:45.245 --> 20:47.664
I was so consumed by
power and money,

20:47.748 --> 20:50.250
I became the very thing
I set out to destroy.

20:50.334 --> 20:53.128
Hooray!
I'm mayor again!

20:53.212 --> 20:55.214
Don't we need to have
a whole new election?

20:57.508 --> 20:58.800
There.

20:58.884 --> 21:00.761
Now no one will
have heard him say that.

21:00.844 --> 21:02.137
We all heard
him say it.

21:04.056 --> 21:06.725
Anybody else hear anything?

21:06.808 --> 21:08.560
My wife did.

21:10.145 --> 21:11.146
(gunshot)

21:13.524 --> 21:18.153
