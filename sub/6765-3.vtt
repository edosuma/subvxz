00:29.068 --> 00:30.618
Valerie?

00:30.651 --> 00:32.201
Yeah.

00:32.234 --> 00:33.441
Hi, it's me.

00:33.473 --> 00:35.735
l didn't mean to scare you.

00:35.773 --> 00:37.500
l didn't know you were out here.

00:37.541 --> 00:39.598
Well, Brandon said that Brenda's
notes from the poetry class

00:39.641 --> 00:42.199
she took last year might be
in one of these old boxes.

00:42.241 --> 00:44.935
Oh, okay, well, just turn the
light out when you're done.

00:44.975 --> 00:46.964
Will do.

01:00.281 --> 01:02.611
Oh, you should've told me
dinner was ready.

01:02.648 --> 01:04.307
l would've helped you
set the table.

01:04.348 --> 01:05.609
Please. lt's take-out.

01:05.649 --> 01:06.876
l hope you like Mexican.

01:06.916 --> 01:08.506
Ooh, love it.

01:08.550 --> 01:09.948
Just be careful of the salsa.

01:10.017 --> 01:11.778
lt's pretty spicy.

01:11.817 --> 01:13.646
One bite and you become
a native Californian.

01:13.684 --> 01:14.775
Pass it this way, then.

01:14.818 --> 01:16.283
All right, where's Brandon?

01:16.318 --> 01:17.477
Oh, on the campaign trail.

01:17.518 --> 01:18.779
Ah, that's my boy.

01:18.820 --> 01:21.651
Have you guys, uh,
ever heard of a Jack McKay?

01:21.687 --> 01:23.482
Why do you ask?

01:23.520 --> 01:25.748
Well, no reason really.

01:25.788 --> 01:27.947
A professor mentioned
his name in a class

01:28.055 --> 01:30.180
on business and ethics
l might be auditing.

01:30.223 --> 01:33.747
Well, he was a textbook
case, all right.

01:33.790 --> 01:34.778
Jim.

01:34.824 --> 01:35.949
Well, what do you
want me to say?

01:35.990 --> 01:37.546
He made a fortune.

01:37.591 --> 01:39.352
Lost a fortune.

01:39.392 --> 01:41.688
Lost his life
when one of his ''partners''

01:41.725 --> 01:43.350
planted a bomb under his car.

01:44.526 --> 01:46.287
ln short, he was a crook.

01:46.327 --> 01:48.225
That's terrible.

01:48.261 --> 01:49.420
Was terrible.

01:49.462 --> 01:50.927
We got to know Jack at the end

01:50.962 --> 01:52.689
because Brenda used
to go out with his son.

01:52.729 --> 01:57.685
Wait, you mean Dylan McKay's
related to Jack McKay?

01:57.730 --> 01:58.696
You've met Dylan?

01:58.730 --> 02:00.889
No. Not really.

02:00.932 --> 02:02.898
Good. Keep it that way.

02:02.932 --> 02:04.363
Jim.

02:04.399 --> 02:05.695
Well, l'm sorry,
but that kid has

02:05.732 --> 02:07.664
given our family enough grief
for a lifetime.

02:07.700 --> 02:10.064
Sorry l brought it up.

02:10.101 --> 02:11.067
That's okay.

02:11.102 --> 02:12.897
Just don't mention him again.

02:12.968 --> 02:15.332
l won't, promise.

03:45.029 --> 03:47.257
With the special
student body elections

03:47.296 --> 03:49.854
for president and vice-president
only two days away.

03:49.930 --> 03:51.691
Whoa, wait, Walter,
hold on, hold on.

03:51.731 --> 03:53.492
l forgot to plug the mic in.

03:58.700 --> 04:00.290
Okay.

04:00.334 --> 04:01.595
Okay, let 'er rip.

04:01.634 --> 04:03.793
With the special
student body elections

04:03.834 --> 04:05.697
for president and vice-president

04:05.735 --> 04:07.928
only two days away,

04:07.969 --> 04:11.800
campaigning on the C.U. campus
has reached a fever pitch.

04:11.837 --> 04:15.668
Emotions are running high
for the 12 sets of candidates,

04:15.705 --> 04:17.295
Almost twice as many
as in recent years,

04:17.339 --> 04:19.168
mostly due
to the bitter infighting

04:19.204 --> 04:21.329
within the Progressive Party.

04:21.373 --> 04:23.669
Now, with each minority
group on campus

04:23.707 --> 04:26.696
running its own slate,
it's highly unlikely

04:26.741 --> 04:30.640
that any one candidate will
be able to win a clear mandate,

04:30.675 --> 04:33.766
although we should have
a better indication,

04:33.810 --> 04:36.299
after tonight's Meet the
Candidates debate at 8:00.

04:36.344 --> 04:39.367
Perhaps the situation is
best summed up,

04:39.411 --> 04:41.604
By saying that no matter
what happens this evening...

04:45.780 --> 04:47.746
Sorry.

04:49.615 --> 04:51.103
Hey, how you doing.

04:51.149 --> 04:52.705
Brandon Walsh, l'm running
for vice-president with...

04:52.749 --> 04:54.476
Hi. How you doing,?
Brandon Walsh.

04:54.517 --> 04:55.608
Damn glad to meet you.

04:55.650 --> 04:58.775
Hi, Brandon Walsh and yes...

04:58.818 --> 05:02.148
You wouldn't happen to be
Brandon Walsh, would you?

05:02.185 --> 05:03.707
l used to be.

05:03.752 --> 05:05.240
Now l'm Brandon Walsh,
the candidate,

05:05.286 --> 05:06.479
an entirely different person.

05:06.520 --> 05:08.281
Well, you both look
pretty good to me.

05:08.320 --> 05:10.149
ln fact, l'm thinking
of voting for them.

05:10.188 --> 05:12.211
You would.

05:12.255 --> 05:14.687
So, do you have time for coffee?

05:14.722 --> 05:16.187
No, he doesn't.

05:16.222 --> 05:17.313
Where have you been?

05:17.356 --> 05:19.049
With the editorial board.
We have to talk.

05:19.090 --> 05:20.680
-Sorry Kelly.
-No you're not.

05:20.724 --> 05:22.587
No. You're right.
l'm too pissed off to be sorry.

05:22.625 --> 05:26.149
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

05:26.192 --> 05:28.556
So l take it The Condor
is not endorsing our
candidacy.

05:28.593 --> 05:32.651
-They're backing Latinos
Unidos. -Latinos Unidos?

05:32.694 --> 05:34.489
l figured they'd back the
Progressives or stay neutral.

05:34.528 --> 05:36.460
Yeah, well, how do you
think l feel, man?

05:36.495 --> 05:37.926
l've been the editor
for two years.

05:37.962 --> 05:39.587
Tough luck, Josh.

05:39.630 --> 05:42.324
Congratulations, Diaz.

05:42.364 --> 05:44.592
So, listen: if you drop out
of the race

05:44.631 --> 05:47.120
and back Ramon and Alicia,
l'll see to it

05:47.165 --> 05:49.131
that they find a spot
for you in their cabinet.

05:49.166 --> 05:50.154
No.

05:50.199 --> 05:51.426
Brandon and l are
going down swinging.

05:51.466 --> 05:52.727
Going down fast, l might add.

05:52.766 --> 05:54.062
Well, that's what you get

05:54.101 --> 05:56.260
for running with the
Chancellor's lackey.

05:56.301 --> 05:57.289
See ya.

05:58.701 --> 06:00.360
Just because l was
on the Task Force.

06:00.402 --> 06:01.459
Now l'm the Chancellor's
lackey?!

06:01.502 --> 06:03.024
You should take it
as a compliment.

06:03.069 --> 06:04.467
l don't know if l have the
patience for this, Josh.

06:04.503 --> 06:05.594
Brandon...

06:05.637 --> 06:07.125
All the mudslinging, the back
room deals, forget it.

06:07.171 --> 06:09.899
Can we just go someplace where
l can rehearse my speech?

06:15.340 --> 06:17.636
Donna.

06:17.674 --> 06:21.698
Kel, you're not gonna
believe this.

06:21.808 --> 06:23.206
l have some great news.

06:23.242 --> 06:24.299
Great.

06:24.342 --> 06:25.603
l found us a new roommate.

06:25.643 --> 06:27.506
-Already?
-Yes. l met her this afternoon

06:27.544 --> 06:29.373
while l was handing out
flyers for Brandon.

06:29.411 --> 06:30.399
She's terrific.

06:30.444 --> 06:32.137
See, she used to live
in the dorms,

06:32.179 --> 06:33.406
but she had to move out

06:33.445 --> 06:34.910
because her roommate
was such a pig.

06:34.946 --> 06:37.037
Actually l already showed
her the apartment. She loves it.

06:37.079 --> 06:40.136
Oh well, do l get to meet her
before she signs the lease?

06:40.181 --> 06:41.612
Yes, of course you do.

06:41.648 --> 06:43.012
She's right outside on the deck.

06:43.048 --> 06:45.173
Don't waste any time
or anything.

06:45.216 --> 06:46.375
Oh, and, and she
already knows Brandon.

06:46.416 --> 06:47.541
That's how we started talking.

06:47.583 --> 06:49.811
Were they in a class
together or something?

06:49.850 --> 06:53.613
No, no, she uh, met him
through the Task Force.

06:53.652 --> 06:55.709
Oh.

06:55.785 --> 06:58.115
By some strange chance, her name
wouldn't happen to be...?

06:58.152 --> 07:01.482
Kelly!

07:01.520 --> 07:02.918
Hello, Clare.

07:02.954 --> 07:04.852
What a great coincidence.

07:04.888 --> 07:06.252
You two already
know each other?

07:06.289 --> 07:09.414
Yeah. We were roommates
at this lame retreat

07:09.455 --> 07:10.648
my father dragged me to.

07:10.723 --> 07:12.313
Her father is the Chancellor.

07:12.356 --> 07:13.878
l know that, Donna.

07:13.924 --> 07:17.755
Wow, you have a great view
from out here, Kel.

07:17.792 --> 07:20.623
Well, l wouldn't get that
attached to it if l were you.

07:20.660 --> 07:21.956
Kelly!

07:21.993 --> 07:25.084
l'm sorry, Clare.

07:25.127 --> 07:26.786
l'm sure that you're
gonna make somebody

07:26.827 --> 07:28.486
a great roommate someday,

07:28.528 --> 07:30.960
but Brandon and l are a real
couple now and it would...

07:30.995 --> 07:33.587
Kelly, l'm not interested
in Brandon anymore.

07:33.629 --> 07:35.618
Please.

07:35.664 --> 07:36.630
No, l'm serious, okay.

07:36.664 --> 07:37.652
That's history.

07:39.098 --> 07:44.259
lf you want to know the truth,
he was kind of lousy in bed.

07:44.300 --> 07:45.596
How would you know, Clare?

07:45.633 --> 07:46.894
You never slept with him.

07:46.934 --> 07:50.833
Exactly, that's what was
so lousy about it.

07:53.569 --> 07:55.194
Come on, what do you say?

07:55.236 --> 07:56.361
l promise

07:56.403 --> 07:58.392
my father's checks
will never bounce.

08:00.704 --> 08:02.294
What the hell.

08:03.672 --> 08:05.070
Come on in.

08:11.541 --> 08:14.439
Dude, you have got to be the
worst driver on the planet.

08:14.475 --> 08:15.839
Will you give me a break?

08:15.876 --> 08:17.103
l grew up in New York.

08:17.143 --> 08:18.768
l didn't even start
driving till l came here.

08:18.810 --> 08:20.003
That's no excuse.

08:20.044 --> 08:21.942
You almost killed
that lady back on Rexford.

08:21.977 --> 08:23.034
Yeah, well, l'd like to see

08:23.078 --> 08:24.600
how you'd do
on the BMT during rush hour.

08:24.711 --> 08:27.041
-What's the BMT?
-My point exactly.

08:27.079 --> 08:28.806
Now, wait till you hear
how l start my speech.

08:28.846 --> 08:30.210
Oh, l can't wait.

08:32.147 --> 08:35.510
Come on, Walsh.
Voters like to be stroked.

08:35.548 --> 08:36.514
But they are not dumb.

08:36.548 --> 08:37.741
lf we're going to lose,

08:37.782 --> 08:39.804
let's at least lose with
a little integrity.

08:39.849 --> 08:41.871
lt's a campaign, man.

08:41.916 --> 08:44.144
lntegrity's got
nothing to do with it.

08:44.183 --> 08:46.776
Hey, the guys in the poster!

08:46.818 --> 08:47.943
Where'd you get that?

08:47.985 --> 08:50.383
Sanders. You got
a great campaign manager.

08:50.419 --> 08:52.214
Now all we need is
a great campaign.

08:54.420 --> 08:56.852
Hey, if you want to give
our campaign a boost,

08:56.888 --> 08:58.047
why don't you go on over there

08:58.088 --> 08:59.610
and get your buddy Hardell
to endorse us.

08:59.722 --> 09:01.018
l can't say that to him.

09:01.056 --> 09:02.885
The worst thing
he can do is say no.

09:02.922 --> 09:05.286
No, the worst thing he can do is
call me an opportunistic weasel.

09:05.324 --> 09:07.654
But you'll do it anyway, right?

09:07.691 --> 09:10.055
All right.

09:10.091 --> 09:13.717
-Hey, D'Shawn.
-Hey, Brandon, what's up, bro?

09:13.759 --> 09:16.089
Well, not too much, you know
l've just been wrapped up

09:16.126 --> 09:17.557
in this whole campus
political thing.

09:17.660 --> 09:19.922
l can use all the support
l can get.

09:19.961 --> 09:22.154
Yeah, l know,
and if l was going to vote,

09:22.195 --> 09:23.751
hey, man, l'd vote for you,

09:23.796 --> 09:25.318
but publicly, l've got
to stay neutral,

09:25.363 --> 09:27.352
-you understand?
-l understand completely.

09:27.396 --> 09:28.952
But with all the heat
l'm getting

09:28.997 --> 09:30.485
from the Brotherhood Coalition,
that l'm staying neutral

09:30.531 --> 09:32.394
shows how much our friendship
means to me, man.

09:32.432 --> 09:34.091
Yeah, me, too.

09:34.131 --> 09:35.097
Good luck, cuz.

09:35.132 --> 09:36.359
Thanks...

09:36.399 --> 09:37.524
we're gonna need it.

09:38.533 --> 09:40.999
Hey, good little girl,

09:41.034 --> 09:43.466
Oh, yes, here we go.

09:46.069 --> 09:49.558
-Hey.
-Hey, what're you doing here?

09:49.604 --> 09:51.263
Uh, l live here, l think.

09:51.303 --> 09:53.292
But only part-time.

09:53.338 --> 09:54.826
Say hello to Daddy.

09:54.871 --> 09:56.700
Okay, say good-bye to Daddy.

09:56.739 --> 09:58.364
Wait a second,
where are you going?

09:58.405 --> 10:01.337
l'm going to Meet the
Candidates debate at school.

10:01.373 --> 10:02.963
You have to meet them on a night

10:03.007 --> 10:04.529
when l'm finally
not working or studying?

10:04.574 --> 10:06.938
l'm going for Brandon.

10:06.975 --> 10:10.464
Come on,
you've already met Brandon.

10:10.509 --> 10:11.702
Besides, he's going
to be crazed.

10:11.743 --> 10:14.868
He's not going to care
whether you're there or not.

10:14.911 --> 10:16.207
l care, okay?

10:17.878 --> 10:19.037
Don't get upset.

10:19.079 --> 10:21.102
l'm not upset.

10:21.145 --> 10:23.805
She's wet.

10:24.747 --> 10:27.407
Okay, l'm upset.

10:27.448 --> 10:29.107
You want me to change her?

10:29.148 --> 10:31.512
No, no, l can change her.

10:31.549 --> 10:34.380
lt's just that at lunch l have
been on the campaign trail

10:34.416 --> 10:36.575
every day with
Steve and Donna.

10:36.683 --> 10:38.546
And l know that Brandon
appreciates it,

10:38.584 --> 10:40.015
don't get me wrong, but he...

10:40.051 --> 10:42.176
Jesse, he never asks
for my opinion anymore,

10:42.219 --> 10:45.208
he never asks
for my take on the issues.

10:45.253 --> 10:47.412
l used to be the editor.

10:47.454 --> 10:50.046
Now what l am is a mom.

10:54.222 --> 10:56.450
Hey.

11:08.860 --> 11:11.520
Hey, Brandon.

11:11.594 --> 11:15.083
You look so stunning,
l, uh, feel guilty

11:15.128 --> 11:16.321
about asking you this,

11:16.362 --> 11:19.453
but would you be offended
if l skipped the debate?

11:19.496 --> 11:22.462
Please. l'd bail if l could.

11:22.497 --> 11:23.793
You sure?

11:23.831 --> 11:27.059
Yeah, l'm not the one giving
the speech, Josh is.

11:27.099 --> 11:28.621
l'm just there
for window dressing.

11:28.666 --> 11:31.326
Steve on the other hand...

11:31.367 --> 11:33.162
Oh, God.

11:33.201 --> 11:35.724
Um, just tell him
l needed to veg, okay?

11:35.768 --> 11:37.734
Sure.

11:37.768 --> 11:39.461
You all right?

11:39.502 --> 11:42.525
Yeah.

11:42.570 --> 11:43.797
lt's just, um...

11:43.837 --> 11:49.294
Well, your Dad got very stern
with me last night

11:49.338 --> 11:52.236
when l accidentally mentioned
the name ''Dylan McKay''.

11:52.273 --> 11:55.501
Ah, Dylan's kind of a sore
subject around here.

11:55.540 --> 11:57.165
Dad used
to be his financial adviser.

11:57.208 --> 11:59.037
Dylan is rich?

11:59.074 --> 12:00.335
Very rich.

12:00.375 --> 12:02.307
He owns some biotech company.

12:02.342 --> 12:04.001
Wow.

12:04.043 --> 12:06.236
He's in kind of a bad way
these days.

12:06.277 --> 12:07.641
l mean, even Nat's tired of him.

12:07.677 --> 12:10.200
He says all he does is sleep
all day and play pool all night.

12:10.244 --> 12:13.938
Pool... used to be
my father's game.

12:13.979 --> 12:15.945
Yeah, l remember.

12:15.979 --> 12:18.445
Well, good luck, Brandon.

12:18.481 --> 12:20.504
Thanks. You, too.

12:58.725 --> 13:00.089
Hey. How are you doing?

13:00.126 --> 13:02.354
Just great considering
they're ready to start

13:02.394 --> 13:03.360
and Josh isn't here.

13:03.394 --> 13:05.053
Where is he?

13:05.094 --> 13:06.390
Apparently, his car broke down.

13:06.428 --> 13:07.587
l don't even have a speech.

13:07.628 --> 13:09.685
You want me to help you
write something?

13:09.729 --> 13:11.422
No, that's okay.
Just do me a favor:

13:11.462 --> 13:13.428
if l ever want to run
for office again,

13:13.463 --> 13:15.190
talk me out of it.

13:17.631 --> 13:19.654
lf we could get started.

13:19.699 --> 13:22.961
Could everyone please take
a seat and quiet down?

13:22.999 --> 13:24.226
Thank you.

13:24.266 --> 13:26.596
l'd like to welcome you all
to our forum,

13:26.634 --> 13:29.623
which will give each candidate
the chance to discuss the issues

13:29.669 --> 13:32.067
in a calm and rational manner.

13:33.503 --> 13:34.730
Could we have some order please!

13:34.770 --> 13:37.259
Could we have some order,
please, everyone?

13:37.304 --> 13:40.032
Please, everyone?
Please sit down!

13:40.071 --> 13:42.935
We need to have some order
on this floor!

13:42.972 --> 13:46.564
We are moving on!

13:46.607 --> 13:48.903
We are moving on. Thank you.

13:48.940 --> 13:51.236
Next, running
on the independent slate,

13:51.274 --> 13:54.468
Josh Richland
and Brandon Walsh.

14:04.478 --> 14:07.342
l know that Josh
would've wanted to be here,

14:07.379 --> 14:12.142
but, uh, he's with his car.

14:12.181 --> 14:13.442
lt broke down...

14:15.114 --> 14:16.273
on the freeway...

14:18.049 --> 14:19.514
...in rush-hour traffic.

14:22.084 --> 14:24.607
But he's the lucky one.

14:24.651 --> 14:27.015
He hasn't had to sit here
for the last 45 minutes

14:27.052 --> 14:28.745
wasting his time
like the rest of us

14:28.786 --> 14:33.981
listening to a lot of people,
say nothing about nothing.

14:35.354 --> 14:36.944
Let's face it, guys,

14:36.988 --> 14:38.681
no one's talking
about the issues here.

14:38.722 --> 14:41.120
No one's willing to stand up

14:41.156 --> 14:43.622
and say that no matter
what our differences are,

14:43.656 --> 14:45.781
the one thing
we all have in common

14:45.824 --> 14:48.017
is this incredible
human laboratory

14:48.058 --> 14:49.648
called California University.

14:49.692 --> 14:54.387
And unless we make a commitment
amongst ourselves

14:54.460 --> 14:56.619
to listen to each other,

14:56.660 --> 14:58.091
to learn from each other,

14:58.127 --> 15:01.423
to put our own personal agendas
aside,

15:01.462 --> 15:04.258
this school
is not gonna survive.

15:06.496 --> 15:07.757
That's what l believe

15:07.797 --> 15:09.592
and that's what the lndependent
party stands for.

15:09.631 --> 15:11.290
Thank you.

15:36.639 --> 15:38.628
So, you looking for a game?

15:38.673 --> 15:39.900
Why, you got one?

15:39.940 --> 15:42.804
ls this anything
like eight ball?

15:42.841 --> 15:44.602
Kind of.
But they call it nine ball.

15:46.942 --> 15:48.601
Well, l think
l could figure it out

15:48.643 --> 15:52.337
if you give me a few pointers.

15:52.377 --> 15:54.809
l'll give you all the
pointers you need, yeah.

15:54.844 --> 15:56.537
You want me to break for you?

15:56.578 --> 15:58.669
No. Let me try.

16:17.250 --> 16:19.182
l, uh, just sunk the nine ball.

16:19.218 --> 16:20.479
ls that bad?

16:20.518 --> 16:23.643
Well, the game's over,
but you won.

16:23.686 --> 16:26.050
l won?

16:26.087 --> 16:29.212
Well, what did l win?

16:29.254 --> 16:30.277
What do you want?

16:30.321 --> 16:31.287
What do you got?

16:31.355 --> 16:34.186
What do you need?

16:34.222 --> 16:38.417
How about one of these
and we'll work from there.

16:40.958 --> 16:42.787
Okay.

16:58.996 --> 17:00.518
Whoa-whoa-whoa,
what're you doing?

17:00.564 --> 17:02.029
You running out on me?

17:02.064 --> 17:04.462
Come on. Don't you think
we've had enough punishment

17:04.498 --> 17:05.486
for one night?

17:05.531 --> 17:07.588
You call this punishment?

17:07.632 --> 17:08.893
No, l'm just getting
warmed up.

17:08.933 --> 17:10.229
Of course, if you'd
rather split,

17:10.333 --> 17:13.231
we could go someplace else
and both get warmed up.

17:13.334 --> 17:14.492
On the first date?

17:14.534 --> 17:16.396
What kind of girl
do you think l am?

17:16.435 --> 17:20.800
l don't know, the kind who likes
a little company.

17:20.837 --> 17:23.803
So it's slam, bam,
thank you, ma'am?

17:23.838 --> 17:26.464
You looking for something
more lasting?

17:26.505 --> 17:30.835
l want... a man...

17:30.873 --> 17:34.169
to ache for me.

17:34.207 --> 17:36.867
Well, l'm aching.

17:36.907 --> 17:40.431
Not yet you're not.

18:17.986 --> 18:20.384
Oh!

18:22.354 --> 18:23.979
Can you believe this?

18:24.021 --> 18:27.613
No, l thought Mr. Pitts
left his intercom on again.

18:29.957 --> 18:32.389
No wonder her ex-roommate
kicked her out.

18:32.424 --> 18:33.912
So, what are we gonna do?

18:41.527 --> 18:43.356
You should have seen your son
last night.

18:43.394 --> 18:46.020
lt was one of the most amazing
things l've ever seen.

18:46.062 --> 18:48.187
What Josh is neglecting
to tell you, Dad,

18:48.229 --> 18:51.457
is that his car broke down
and he hardly saw any of it.

18:51.497 --> 18:52.690
l saw enough to know

18:52.730 --> 18:54.161
that we picked up hundreds
of votes last night.

18:54.197 --> 18:56.891
l do believe this is what
they call ''spin control''.

18:56.931 --> 18:58.897
What is this, captioning
for the hard of hearing?

18:58.931 --> 19:00.295
l'm just trying to maintain

19:00.333 --> 19:03.129
some little bit of credibility
here, that's all.

19:03.199 --> 19:04.824
You know,
this false modesty routine

19:04.867 --> 19:06.128
isn't fooling anyone, Walsh.

19:06.167 --> 19:08.258
You want to win this
as much as l do.

19:08.301 --> 19:10.995
Wait a minute.
Correct me if l'm wrong.

19:11.035 --> 19:15.025
You asked me to run with you,
isn't that how it worked?

19:15.070 --> 19:16.093
Yeah,

19:16.137 --> 19:17.762
and you could have said no.

19:17.804 --> 19:19.360
You see what l'm up against?

19:19.405 --> 19:21.132
As far as l can tell,
you two definitely

19:21.205 --> 19:22.262
deserve each other.

19:22.305 --> 19:24.965
You're a bunch of
clowns, both of you.

19:26.106 --> 19:29.766
Boom! Oh!

19:29.808 --> 19:31.967
Am l missing something?

19:32.008 --> 19:35.463
Just another
male-bonding ritual.

19:35.510 --> 19:37.976
You were out pretty late
last night.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.976
Oh, yeah, sorry.

19:40.011 --> 19:42.068
After the debate,
l drove down to the beach

19:42.111 --> 19:43.407
to kind of clear my head.

19:43.445 --> 19:45.434
You know,
you do have to be careful.

19:45.479 --> 19:47.138
The beach can be
very dangerous at night.

19:47.212 --> 19:50.235
That's why l stayed inside
and locked the doors.

19:50.280 --> 19:54.145
Have l told you how much l love
having you here?

19:54.182 --> 19:56.876
Yeah, but you can
always tell me again.

20:00.216 --> 20:01.147
Have fun.

20:01.217 --> 20:02.478
Bye, bye.

20:09.986 --> 20:11.350
Morning.

20:11.386 --> 20:13.978
ls it?

20:14.021 --> 20:15.452
Kelly.

20:15.488 --> 20:18.886
So, Clare,
how'd you sleep last night?

20:18.922 --> 20:21.320
Oh! Unbelievable.

20:21.356 --> 20:24.084
l left the windows wide open
so l heard the waves breaking,

20:24.123 --> 20:27.453
kept breathing in
all these good clean ions.

20:27.491 --> 20:29.684
l can't tell you
how refreshed l feel.

20:29.726 --> 20:31.385
Glad one of us is.

20:31.426 --> 20:33.119
ls something wrong, Kel?

20:33.160 --> 20:35.752
Yeah, Clare, something's wrong.

20:35.794 --> 20:39.955
But l'm sure it's nothing
we can't take care of.

20:39.995 --> 20:43.086
Has anyone ever told you

20:43.129 --> 20:46.061
you might have a slight
tendency towards, um....

20:47.731 --> 20:49.560
-...snoring?
-Yeah.

20:49.598 --> 20:52.496
Have you been talking
to my old roommate?

20:52.532 --> 20:54.862
No, we've been listening to you.

20:54.900 --> 20:56.559
Come on.
How bad could it be?

20:56.600 --> 20:58.964
Oh, you want to hear
how bad it is?

21:09.004 --> 21:14.835
My God, l'm, l'm really sorry
you guys, l had, l had no idea.

21:14.872 --> 21:18.896
Well, it, it sounds
a lot worse on the tape.

21:18.940 --> 21:20.769
Look, l'll have my stuff out
by tomorrow, okay?

21:20.808 --> 21:22.433
No. Come on.

21:22.474 --> 21:24.440
We've just gotta find
a cure or something.

21:24.475 --> 21:27.373
Well, l wouldn't get
my hopes up.

21:27.409 --> 21:29.398
l don't know, l've tried

21:29.443 --> 21:31.341
holistic herbal teas,

21:31.377 --> 21:34.071
subliminal mail-order tapes.

21:34.111 --> 21:37.236
lt's so weird.

21:37.279 --> 21:40.734
The only time l don't snore
is when l'm with a guy.

21:42.213 --> 21:45.236
So if Brandon's not busy,
maybe he could, um...

21:45.281 --> 21:47.213
Don't even think about it.

21:48.382 --> 21:50.211
l'm sure if we put
our heads together,

21:50.249 --> 21:52.078
we can come up with something.

21:52.116 --> 21:55.207
Or someone.

21:57.485 --> 22:01.941
Wait a minute, we just put in
a new air conditioner, Nat.

22:01.985 --> 22:04.577
Yeah. That was for the kitchen.

22:04.620 --> 22:07.143
-This is for the freezer.
-So what are you telling me,

22:07.188 --> 22:09.245
Willy's cool,
but the food is melting?

22:09.288 --> 22:12.379
What can l say?
lt's a labor of love.

22:13.756 --> 22:16.222
Tell you what, we got to
stop calling this place

22:16.256 --> 22:19.052
the Peach Pit,
start calling it the Money Pit.

22:19.157 --> 22:21.988
That's what it is, a money pit.

22:23.959 --> 22:26.619
Whoa. ls it?
Could it be?

22:26.660 --> 22:28.922
lt looks like that phantom,
Dylan McKay.

22:28.960 --> 22:30.585
How you doing, Steve?

22:30.627 --> 22:32.593
All right man, l'm busy.
How about you?

22:32.628 --> 22:34.958
-Getting by.
-Oh, yeah?

22:34.995 --> 22:36.154
Well, how about our boy?

22:36.196 --> 22:37.457
You should've seen
Brandon last night.

22:37.496 --> 22:39.587
He got up in front of
the entire student body,

22:39.630 --> 22:40.891
-and there was silence...
-Steve...

22:40.931 --> 22:42.954
if l was interested
in campus politics,

22:42.998 --> 22:44.987
l'd still be on
campus-- sit down.

22:46.032 --> 22:47.657
Oh. Forgive me.
l thought you may

22:47.699 --> 22:49.824
have some interest in what
our buddy Brandon's doing,

22:49.867 --> 22:52.527
but l guess not.

22:52.568 --> 22:55.534
What's the matter with you?
Are you okay?

22:59.303 --> 23:00.599
Yeah, Steve, l'm fine--

23:00.636 --> 23:02.602
l'm just, you know,
drinking coffee.

23:03.904 --> 23:06.530
l kind of know what
you're going through, man.

23:06.572 --> 23:08.401
Don't forget,
Kelly dumped me, too.

23:08.439 --> 23:10.905
Steve...

23:10.940 --> 23:13.532
first of all,
Kelly did not dump me.

23:13.574 --> 23:16.665
Second of all, it don't matter,
l'm on the chase again already.

23:16.708 --> 23:19.197
Dude! Who's this?

23:19.242 --> 23:21.105
Some chick l met last night.

23:21.143 --> 23:22.370
Oh, yeah?

23:22.410 --> 23:24.535
Well, l met someone, too--
her name is Valerie.

23:24.577 --> 23:27.408
Very pretty, and get this--
she lives at the Walshes.

23:27.444 --> 23:30.002
At the Walshes?

23:30.111 --> 23:31.542
You got a problem with that?

23:31.579 --> 23:33.238
No.

23:33.279 --> 23:34.609
Good.

23:34.646 --> 23:36.202
Keep it that way.

23:46.016 --> 23:48.278
Look, if you hate
Professor Rosin so much,

23:48.318 --> 23:49.908
why don't you just drop out?

23:49.951 --> 23:51.746
l would,
but it's a requirement.

23:51.785 --> 23:53.478
-Hey, group.
-Hey, Josh.

23:53.519 --> 23:55.747
Walter Chen thinks
l should step aside

23:55.786 --> 23:57.752
and turn the presidency
over to you.

23:57.787 --> 23:59.946
Oh, that's what l've
been saying all along.

23:59.987 --> 24:01.509
Thanks, but no, thanks, guys.

24:01.554 --> 24:03.952
Well, momentum is
definitely swinging our way.

24:03.989 --> 24:05.148
And half of the Alpha House,
they're voting

24:05.189 --> 24:06.519
for you guys
instead of the Greeks.

24:06.556 --> 24:07.522
Cool.

24:07.556 --> 24:08.579
What do you want?

24:08.623 --> 24:10.213
l'll just have some
of whatever you get.

24:10.257 --> 24:11.245
What about me?

24:11.290 --> 24:12.483
What about you, Josh?

24:12.525 --> 24:14.187
Double espresso, no sugar.

24:14.228 --> 24:17.394
Josh is a little tired today.

24:17.435 --> 24:19.234
Hey, Andrea. What are you
doing over here?

24:19.272 --> 24:21.538
We're sitting over there--
why don't you come join us?

24:21.577 --> 24:24.572
l wouldn't want to interrupt
their strategy session.

24:24.617 --> 24:26.416
What are you talking about?

24:26.454 --> 24:28.013
Nothing.

24:29.293 --> 24:33.256
Last night, Brandon was
so busy being Mr. Candidate

24:33.302 --> 24:36.638
that he didn't even take a
second to ask how l was doing.

24:36.675 --> 24:38.668
And then when l tried
to talk to him

24:38.713 --> 24:40.683
about some of the things
that he could do

24:40.717 --> 24:43.883
to get out the vote,
he just walked away.

24:43.924 --> 24:46.019
You know what l think?

24:46.129 --> 24:47.996
l think you should
stop being so neurotic

24:48.033 --> 24:49.866
and just go over
and talk to him.

24:49.903 --> 24:51.269
l don't think so.

24:51.307 --> 24:52.570
l'm telling you--

24:52.609 --> 24:54.670
try it, go.

24:54.713 --> 24:55.942
Okay.

24:59.557 --> 25:00.786
Hi, guys.

25:00.826 --> 25:03.456
-Hey, Zuckerman. Sit down.
-Hey. -Hi.

25:03.498 --> 25:06.800
Oh, man, look who's
on his way over here.

25:06.839 --> 25:08.307
Who's that?

25:08.343 --> 25:09.811
Alex Diaz.

25:09.845 --> 25:12.111
He's on the student senate
and the ''Condor,''

25:12.150 --> 25:14.347
and he's running
Alicia Kaboda's campaign.

25:14.388 --> 25:15.720
Oh. She's nice.

25:15.758 --> 25:16.783
Well, he's a creep.

25:16.827 --> 25:18.489
Mm. You want something?

25:18.530 --> 25:20.089
No, thank you.

25:22.338 --> 25:25.037
Hey, what do you got there,
Alex, concession speech?

25:25.111 --> 25:27.206
Actually, Josh,
it's something you wrote.

25:27.249 --> 25:30.882
l thought you and Walsh
ought to take a look at it.

25:30.923 --> 25:33.622
-Would you like one, too?
-What is it?

25:35.433 --> 25:38.405
What, are you crazy, Alex?

25:38.439 --> 25:41.377
l never took a test
for D'Shawn Hardell.

25:41.412 --> 25:44.076
Well, l only know
what l read in the newspaper.

25:44.151 --> 25:45.847
No, you didn't read it
in the paper, because it was

25:45.888 --> 25:47.550
-never printed.
-And why is that, Josh?

25:47.591 --> 25:48.718
Because it wasn't true.

25:48.761 --> 25:49.990
Wasn't true,

25:50.030 --> 25:52.432
or wasn't in your
best interest to publish?

25:52.469 --> 25:53.960
l mean, after all,
why stir things up

25:54.005 --> 25:56.738
when you can cut a deal with the
chancellor's fair-haired boy?

25:56.778 --> 25:59.773
And what deal would you
be talking about, Alex?

25:59.818 --> 26:01.116
Where did you get this?

26:01.153 --> 26:03.146
A little birdie gave it to me.

26:03.192 --> 26:04.626
What do you
want from me, Alex?

26:04.661 --> 26:08.065
There is a student senate
meeting tonight,

26:08.102 --> 26:11.701
and this is going to be the
first item under new business

26:11.743 --> 26:14.373
unless you drop out of the race.

26:14.415 --> 26:16.908
No. We're not taking
our names off the ballot.

26:16.954 --> 26:18.582
Well, then my hunch is,

26:18.624 --> 26:20.890
you are going to end up
being disqualified.

26:21.965 --> 26:25.096
And you are gonna end up
being thrown out of school.

26:26.406 --> 26:28.205
-Look...
-No, you look.

26:28.245 --> 26:30.579
The senate convenes
in four hours.

26:30.616 --> 26:34.077
l strongly suggest
you think it over.

26:35.760 --> 26:37.456
Creep.

26:46.817 --> 26:48.149
You guys, after rereading
this article,

26:48.187 --> 26:49.155
it's not as bad as l thought.

26:49.255 --> 26:50.689
l mean, it's all just
hearsay and conjecture.

26:50.725 --> 26:51.920
That's why l never ran it.

26:51.961 --> 26:53.589
You shouldn't have written it
in the first place.

26:53.631 --> 26:55.931
Should've, would've, could've.
What do you want me to say?

26:55.969 --> 26:57.665
There were a ton of rumors
floating around school

26:57.706 --> 26:59.505
about how the jocks were
getting all kinds of perks--

26:59.543 --> 27:00.511
l went after the story.

27:00.545 --> 27:02.104
Well, once you found out
the story wasn't true,

27:02.216 --> 27:04.015
couldn't you have hit the
delete button on your computer?

27:04.053 --> 27:06.250
Should've, would've, could've.

27:06.291 --> 27:07.725
You know, Josh,
the day l agreed

27:07.760 --> 27:08.887
to be your
running mate's

27:08.930 --> 27:10.660
the day l should've had
my head examined.

27:10.701 --> 27:12.898
Should've, would've, could've!

27:12.938 --> 27:15.374
Will you guys
keep your voices down?

27:15.410 --> 27:17.380
You have a profile
on this campus now.

27:17.414 --> 27:18.382
People are watching you.

27:18.416 --> 27:20.909
So, what are you gonna do?

27:20.955 --> 27:22.048
Doesn't matter what we do--

27:22.091 --> 27:23.719
the campaign will be
dead in the water.

27:23.761 --> 27:25.093
-Why?
-Because

27:25.131 --> 27:26.793
by the time the polls open,
they'll have reprints

27:26.835 --> 27:28.428
of this thing plastered
all over the place.

27:28.472 --> 27:29.940
But none of it's true, Josh.

27:29.974 --> 27:31.169
Yeah, well,
the votes'll be counted

27:31.211 --> 27:32.839
by the time
we set the record straight.

27:32.880 --> 27:34.348
Not necessarily.

27:34.384 --> 27:37.322
What if we put out
a flyer of our own

27:37.356 --> 27:39.690
refuting the article,
point by point?

27:39.728 --> 27:41.196
lt'll be their word
against ours.

27:41.232 --> 27:43.202
You're missing the point, Josh.

27:43.269 --> 27:45.205
What we say
on the flyer is that

27:45.240 --> 27:47.403
this is just another example
of the slimy politics

27:47.445 --> 27:48.879
that goes on here
every election.

27:48.914 --> 27:51.681
And that's exactly why
California University needs

27:51.720 --> 27:55.090
a new crop of independent
student leaders

27:55.127 --> 27:58.429
who won't tolerate
politics as usual anymore.

28:00.238 --> 28:02.800
You know, that might just work.

28:02.844 --> 28:04.312
Forget it, it'll never fly.

28:04.347 --> 28:06.442
-How do you know?
-How do l know?

28:06.485 --> 28:08.478
Because we're dropping out
of the race, that's how l know.

28:08.522 --> 28:09.615
Brandon, how can you

28:09.658 --> 28:10.921
just cave in like that?

28:10.961 --> 28:12.429
Especially
when none of it's true.

28:12.464 --> 28:14.661
How do we know
if it's true or not?

28:14.702 --> 28:17.070
All l did was tutor D'Shawn

28:17.108 --> 28:18.804
in one class,
where l was encouraged

28:18.845 --> 28:20.211
to take his test for him.

28:20.280 --> 28:22.648
What if we find some
user-friendly professor

28:22.686 --> 28:24.485
who did change a grade
for D'Shawn.

28:24.523 --> 28:26.014
Where's that gonna leave him?

28:26.060 --> 28:27.790
l'll tell you where
it's gonna leave him--

28:27.830 --> 28:29.355
it's gonna leave him
without a scholarship,

28:29.400 --> 28:31.199
never being able to play
college basketball again,

28:31.237 --> 28:33.434
and it's gonna land him at home
before Christmas.

28:34.611 --> 28:36.102
Okay, why don't we
just ask D'Shawn

28:36.148 --> 28:37.207
what the real story is.

28:37.250 --> 28:38.080
Forget it.

28:38.118 --> 28:39.951
Come on, Brandon.

28:39.989 --> 28:42.357
Everything'll be off the record.

28:42.394 --> 28:46.232
And l promise you,
if he's not clean...

28:46.269 --> 28:49.241
we'll drop out,
no questions asked, okay?

28:49.275 --> 28:50.766
That sounds reasonable.

28:50.812 --> 28:53.009
l can't do it.

28:53.050 --> 28:53.880
Why?

28:53.919 --> 28:55.114
Why? Because it's
a conversation

28:55.154 --> 28:56.816
l'm not prepared to have,
that's why.

28:58.094 --> 29:01.157
Well, l can talk to him
if you want me to.

29:04.107 --> 29:06.100
lt's not a problem.

29:12.624 --> 29:14.924
Hey, is your friend here?

29:14.963 --> 29:17.195
No, not yet.

29:17.235 --> 29:18.703
l'll wait.

29:41.920 --> 29:44.186
Kelly, what are you
doing down here?

29:44.225 --> 29:45.955
Oh, don't ask.

29:45.995 --> 29:47.224
The meeting has
already started,

29:47.264 --> 29:48.630
nobody can find
Donna or D'Shawn,

29:48.668 --> 29:51.264
and Brandon is a nervous wreck
and he won't go inside.

29:51.306 --> 29:52.672
Well, where's Josh?

29:52.709 --> 29:54.234
He's in the meeting.

29:54.279 --> 29:56.579
l'm gonna go back to the gym
and look for Donna.

29:56.617 --> 29:58.519
Will you do me a favor
and go upstairs

29:58.555 --> 30:00.457
and see if you can't
say something to him?

30:00.492 --> 30:02.894
-l'll see what l can do.
-Thanks.

30:12.317 --> 30:14.617
l don't have
the stomach for this.

30:14.655 --> 30:17.217
Take two Pepto Bismols
and call me in the morning.

30:17.261 --> 30:19.128
Shouldn't you be
in day care or something?

30:19.164 --> 30:21.760
Yes, l should, but instead,
l have to come up here

30:21.803 --> 30:23.203
and baby-sit Josh Richland's
running mate.

30:23.240 --> 30:26.770
Oh, how l let that guy
talk me into this is beyond me.

30:26.814 --> 30:29.341
Brandon, l love you,
but shut up, okay?

30:29.387 --> 30:31.584
Nobody put a gun to your head.

30:31.624 --> 30:33.115
lnstead of playing the
poor, innocent victim,

30:33.161 --> 30:35.290
can't you accept the fact
that you're a born leader

30:35.332 --> 30:37.234
with a brain and intellect
to make a difference

30:37.270 --> 30:38.533
in this world?

30:38.572 --> 30:40.302
-Right.
-l was there,

30:40.343 --> 30:42.438
standing right next to you,
when you put everything

30:42.514 --> 30:44.244
on the line
to shut down West Beverly

30:44.284 --> 30:46.983
so that Donna could graduate
with the rest of our class.

30:47.023 --> 30:48.286
Andrea, that was high school.

30:48.327 --> 30:50.820
lt was the exact same thing.

30:50.865 --> 30:51.992
Don't you see?

30:52.034 --> 30:54.334
A friend was in trouble,
and you were there.

30:54.373 --> 30:56.309
No matter what goes on
in there,

30:56.344 --> 30:58.405
no matter
what they say about you,

30:58.448 --> 31:01.044
you have nothing
to be ashamed of.

31:08.670 --> 31:10.640
So, you want to go in?

31:12.378 --> 31:14.507
l thought you'd never ask.

31:19.760 --> 31:23.723
Brandon Walsh is part of a plan

31:23.768 --> 31:27.207
to process D'Shawn Hardell
through a system

31:27.242 --> 31:30.305
of academic apartheid.

31:30.349 --> 31:32.683
And make no mistake about it...

31:32.720 --> 31:35.749
it's a very profitable system.

31:35.794 --> 31:39.393
But how profitable is it
going to be for D'Shawn

31:39.435 --> 31:44.400
when he leaves C.U.
without a real education?

31:44.445 --> 31:48.647
And why is it
that these disposable athletes

31:48.687 --> 31:50.680
are always young men of color,

31:50.724 --> 31:55.962
while their tutors
are always white boys

31:56.002 --> 31:58.199
who just happen to be appointed
by the Chancellor

31:58.241 --> 31:59.903
to the National Task Force
on Education?

31:59.945 --> 32:01.744
Wait a minute, l don't
understand what me being on...

32:01.782 --> 32:02.750
You're out of order!

32:02.784 --> 32:04.150
And you're out of line.

32:09.464 --> 32:11.160
Sorry for interrupting,
everybody.

32:11.201 --> 32:13.968
But my name is
D'Shawn Hardell,

32:14.007 --> 32:15.977
and everything
you're accusing Brandon of

32:16.011 --> 32:17.377
might have been true

32:17.414 --> 32:19.441
if Brandon was
a different kind of person.

32:22.959 --> 32:26.763
But, fortunately for me,
he is who he is.

32:26.800 --> 32:30.433
So l had no choice but
to crack open the books.

32:30.476 --> 32:34.712
And for that,
l'll always be grateful.

32:34.751 --> 32:37.951
Because l've been able to
maintain my academic eligibility

32:37.991 --> 32:42.329
without any help
from anyone but myself.

32:44.004 --> 32:46.201
And for those of you
who don't think

32:46.242 --> 32:47.938
l have the God-
given intelligence

32:47.979 --> 32:51.349
to go to school here...

32:51.386 --> 32:54.256
l just have to say,
no matter what you think

32:54.292 --> 32:57.753
your political agenda is...

32:57.800 --> 33:00.738
you're nothing but a racist.

33:11.997 --> 33:17.805
ls that a cue stick, or are
you just happy to see me?

33:17.842 --> 33:21.714
Well, the last time l saw you,
you were running away, so...

33:21.751 --> 33:24.244
A big emergency came up.

33:24.288 --> 33:26.451
l had to rotate my tires.

33:26.494 --> 33:28.930
You know, you don't look
like much of a mechanic.

33:28.966 --> 33:31.904
Why? You need a lube job?

33:31.938 --> 33:35.138
Who are you?

33:35.179 --> 33:36.477
l told you last night.

33:36.515 --> 33:39.919
l'm Minnesota Fats'
long-lost daughter.

33:39.955 --> 33:41.948
Right. And you
and Paul Newman

33:41.993 --> 33:44.395
traveled the country
looking for games.

33:44.432 --> 33:45.730
Who are you?

33:45.767 --> 33:47.828
lt's the truth.

33:47.872 --> 33:51.072
lt's what l did right
after l quit the circus.

33:51.112 --> 33:52.603
Hey, McKay, you're up.

33:52.649 --> 33:54.516
Thanks, man.

33:54.553 --> 33:56.921
You know, l'm really
not in the mood

33:56.958 --> 33:59.987
to shoot pool tonight. Hmm?

34:00.031 --> 34:02.901
What else could you
have in mind?

34:05.677 --> 34:07.544
Vote Richland-Walsh.
Thanks. Take one.

34:07.581 --> 34:10.143
Hey, vote Richland-Walsh.

34:10.186 --> 34:11.710
Yo, bud!

34:13.693 --> 34:15.822
Hey, Steve, what's going on?

34:15.864 --> 34:17.561
Well, the rules committee
had a little meeting.

34:17.601 --> 34:20.094
Kelly and l are now
official vote counters, huh?

34:20.141 --> 34:21.632
Whoo-hoo!

34:21.676 --> 34:23.268
Just don't do anything to get me
disqualified, all right?

34:23.313 --> 34:25.647
Moi? Come on.

34:25.685 --> 34:27.152
Hey, what's going
on over there?

34:27.188 --> 34:28.315
ls that some kind of rally?

34:28.358 --> 34:29.417
Yeah. After the Senate let out,

34:29.460 --> 34:31.224
-it just sort of happened.
-Cool.

34:31.264 --> 34:32.630
l heard D'Shawn
was outrageous,

34:32.667 --> 34:33.657
and Alicia fired Diaz

34:33.702 --> 34:35.398
as her campaign manager.

34:35.438 --> 34:37.841
Yeah, Latino Unidos
is in total disarray,

34:37.877 --> 34:39.139
but the Greeks are
coming on strong,

34:39.181 --> 34:40.980
and the Progressives are
still the party to beat.

34:41.018 --> 34:42.315
No. You are coming on strong,

34:42.353 --> 34:43.342
and you are the party to beat.

34:43.389 --> 34:44.652
lt's in the bag, bro.

34:47.697 --> 34:50.190
-Oh, my God.
-What?

34:50.237 --> 34:51.603
Look who's with Donna.

34:54.078 --> 34:58.713
Yeah. Uh...
That's Donna's new roommate.

35:00.158 --> 35:04.930
Clare moved
into the beach house?

35:04.968 --> 35:07.530
Have you guys
seen Valerie anywhere?

35:14.923 --> 35:16.482
What are you smiling at?

35:21.102 --> 35:23.835
Where did you learn that trick?

35:23.875 --> 35:25.708
l told you.

35:25.812 --> 35:28.511
l ran away
and joined the big top.

35:28.551 --> 35:31.387
Oh, you're one of
those acrobats, right?

35:31.424 --> 35:33.154
No, wait.
A contortionist.

35:33.194 --> 35:36.929
And a lion tamer.

35:39.207 --> 35:41.302
Well, you must be
pretty good with a whip.

35:41.345 --> 35:43.679
Had those big cats
right where l wanted them.

35:43.717 --> 35:46.017
Oh, yeah?

35:46.055 --> 35:50.827
Up on their hind legs,
and loving every minute of it.

35:55.408 --> 35:57.708
Who are you?

36:21.162 --> 36:23.029
Are you sure this is legal?

36:23.066 --> 36:24.694
Yes. l got it
at an auto parts store.

36:24.736 --> 36:26.432
An auto parts store?

36:26.473 --> 36:28.169
lt's for women
who don't want to look

36:28.210 --> 36:29.439
like they're driving home
alone at night,

36:29.480 --> 36:30.948
so they stick him on
the front seat next to them.

36:30.983 --> 36:33.579
l don't know about this.

36:33.622 --> 36:34.885
lt's going to work great.

36:34.925 --> 36:36.393
You said the only time
you don't snore

36:36.428 --> 36:37.760
is when you're in bed
with a guy.

36:37.798 --> 36:39.460
So...

36:39.501 --> 36:43.566
meet Mr. Man.

36:43.609 --> 36:46.102
Hey, sailor. New in town? Hmm.

36:46.148 --> 36:49.678
Well, he is kind of cute
in an inflatable kind of way.

36:49.722 --> 36:50.951
Yeah. And l bet

36:50.991 --> 36:53.553
he doesn't leave
his dirty dishes in the sink.

36:53.597 --> 36:55.396
Better yet, he probably doesn't
leave the toilet seat up.

36:55.434 --> 36:57.461
Or make you feel guilty
for being in a bad mood.

36:57.506 --> 37:01.571
ln other words, he's perfect,
and l want him.

37:13.305 --> 37:15.400
What's wrong?

37:15.444 --> 37:18.006
Can you drive me home?

37:18.049 --> 37:19.813
Stay awhile.

37:19.853 --> 37:21.412
l can't.

37:21.456 --> 37:23.585
l have a curfew.

37:24.830 --> 37:26.766
You have a what?

37:26.800 --> 37:29.270
Just take me home.

37:42.434 --> 37:44.768
Turn right at the corner.

37:44.805 --> 37:47.139
l still can't believe
you live in Beverly Hills.

37:47.177 --> 37:50.274
Why? You don't think l fit in?

37:50.317 --> 37:54.018
Why would you want to?

37:54.059 --> 37:56.997
That's it over there.

38:02.376 --> 38:03.844
Something wrong?

38:03.946 --> 38:05.471
You're Valerie?

38:05.515 --> 38:07.644
Oh. Good news travels fast.

38:07.687 --> 38:10.625
Why do l get the feeling l'm
being set up or something here?

38:10.660 --> 38:12.857
Beats me.

38:12.898 --> 38:14.389
You knew exactly who l was

38:14.434 --> 38:16.233
when you walked
into that pool hall.

38:18.075 --> 38:20.011
Sweet dreams, Dylan.

38:56.657 --> 38:58.250
Ready when you are.

39:02.370 --> 39:04.340
After a tumultuous campaign

39:04.374 --> 39:07.835
which saw more than its share
of charges and countercharges,

39:07.881 --> 39:10.876
C.U. students are finally
going to the polls today

39:10.920 --> 39:14.917
to elect their new
student body officers.

39:14.996 --> 39:16.932
lf this campaign
has proven anything,

39:17.033 --> 39:18.935
it's that anything can happen.

39:19.037 --> 39:21.030
Oh, God!

39:21.075 --> 39:22.475
Now what did you do?

39:22.512 --> 39:23.912
Nothing.

39:23.948 --> 39:26.510
Gotcha!

39:36.340 --> 39:38.207
You think, if we slipped
out the back door,

39:38.245 --> 39:39.577
anyone would notice?

39:39.614 --> 39:40.912
l think it's worth a shot.

39:40.951 --> 39:44.652
Hey, my father wanted you
to know that any friend

39:44.692 --> 39:46.889
of his lackey
is a good friend of his.

39:46.930 --> 39:48.159
Give him my best.

39:48.200 --> 39:49.168
l will.

39:49.202 --> 39:51.638
-Hey, Clare.
-Hi.

39:51.674 --> 39:53.267
Any word yet?

39:53.310 --> 39:54.972
Dad, correct me if l'm wrong.

39:55.013 --> 39:56.675
Didn't you come over
here 20 minutes ago

39:56.717 --> 39:58.310
and ask me that
exact same question?

39:58.354 --> 40:00.551
And didn't l, at that time,
explain to you

40:00.592 --> 40:02.585
that Kelly and Steve
said it would be hours

40:02.630 --> 40:03.723
before all the ballots
were counted.

40:03.765 --> 40:05.826
Just let me know if they call.

40:05.870 --> 40:07.463
He will, honey.
He will.

40:07.507 --> 40:09.773
l will. Bye-bye.

40:09.812 --> 40:12.248
Your parents and my parents
are so alike, it's scary.

40:12.283 --> 40:13.808
Hey!

40:13.853 --> 40:15.287
Look who's here.

40:15.323 --> 40:16.882
We had to come pay our respects.

40:16.927 --> 40:18.020
Hi, cutie pie.

40:18.062 --> 40:19.223
Josh, campaign's over.

40:19.265 --> 40:20.324
You don't have
to kiss any more babies.

40:20.367 --> 40:21.596
Will you give me a break?

40:21.637 --> 40:23.003
-Well, maybe, if we get elected.
-Oh, come on.

40:23.039 --> 40:24.872
ls there any doubt you guys
are going to win in a walk?

40:24.911 --> 40:26.345
-Yes.
-Yes.

40:26.380 --> 40:28.714
lt looks like it's getting
down to the wire, you guys.

40:28.752 --> 40:31.690
lf it isn't my favorite
Minister of Propaganda.

40:31.724 --> 40:34.092
l think l deserve a better title
than that. Don't you, Josh?

40:34.130 --> 40:35.325
How about Friend of the Court?

40:35.365 --> 40:36.333
How about Best Friend

40:36.367 --> 40:37.562
of the Court?

40:37.604 --> 40:39.004
What am l?
Chopped Liver?

40:39.040 --> 40:40.303
No. You're the tall guy

40:40.343 --> 40:41.971
who towers above the rest
of us mere mortals.

40:42.013 --> 40:44.313
And who goes out on
a limb for his friends.

40:44.351 --> 40:46.821
And who dragged the entire
varsity basketball team

40:46.856 --> 40:49.019
to the polls to vote
for the lndependent slate.

40:49.061 --> 40:50.997
-Thanks, man.
-lt was the least l could do.

40:51.032 --> 40:52.125
Hey, everybody!

40:52.234 --> 40:54.101
Hot pies out of the oven.
Who's hungry?

40:54.138 --> 40:55.606
-Me.
-Me.

40:55.642 --> 40:58.135
Go get 'em, guys.

40:58.181 --> 40:59.649
l'm too nervous to eat.

40:59.683 --> 41:01.915
So that's why you're so scrawny.

41:01.955 --> 41:04.084
You must spend a lot
of time nervous.

41:04.193 --> 41:07.097
Guys, Walter Chen wants to do
a ''Day ln The Life'' cinema...

41:07.166 --> 41:08.862
-verite...
-verite...

41:08.902 --> 41:10.370
thing, right, with you two.

41:10.406 --> 41:12.706
l think we should probably wait
till we're elected

41:12.745 --> 41:14.509
before we commit
to something like that, David.

41:14.548 --> 41:17.952
That's a good idea.

41:17.989 --> 41:20.927
-l gotta get out of here.
-Yeah.

41:22.499 --> 41:24.127
Hey, good luck, you guys.

41:24.236 --> 41:26.103
Thanks.

41:26.140 --> 41:28.133
So, win or lose,
what are the chances

41:28.177 --> 41:30.773
of you, me, Kelly and
Valerie going out together?

41:30.816 --> 41:33.378
Look at you, already trying
to make backroom deals.

41:33.422 --> 41:34.856
l've got a reputation to uphold.

41:34.891 --> 41:36.382
Let's not talk
about your reputation.

41:36.428 --> 41:37.760
Didn't Kelly call yet?

41:37.798 --> 41:39.426
Get out of here.

41:39.467 --> 41:40.594
Okay. Just wondering.

41:40.637 --> 41:42.196
Go on, go on.
Get out of here.

41:50.090 --> 41:52.185
Oh, man, l didn't think

41:52.295 --> 41:53.593
we were going to get
out of there alive.

41:53.630 --> 41:54.689
No kidding.

41:54.733 --> 41:55.962
You want to, uh...

41:56.002 --> 41:57.402
you want to take
a ride or something?

41:57.438 --> 41:58.906
Kill some time
till Kelly and Steve call?

41:58.942 --> 42:00.638
ln your car?

42:00.679 --> 42:02.409
l'm a man of the people.

42:02.449 --> 42:04.248
Well, say hi
to the people for me.

42:04.286 --> 42:08.158
l'll be back in 20 minutes.

42:08.194 --> 42:10.255
-Hey, Josh.
-What?

42:12.203 --> 42:15.938
What are we going to do
if we actually win this thing?

42:15.978 --> 42:20.009
What every politician does--
we'll make it up as we go along.

42:20.053 --> 42:23.321
-See ya.
-See ya.

43:29.733 --> 43:31.326
Are you okay?

43:38.185 --> 43:40.781
We finished counting the votes.

43:40.824 --> 43:42.417
You won.
