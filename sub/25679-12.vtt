{\an1}you came in and you were
telling me to clean it up,

10:04.937 --> 10:09.575

"She faking and she crazy."

the night before--

10:35.101 --> 10:37.136
{\an3}Okay.

--and my body was just
totally out of whack.

10:52.852 --> 10:55.254

10:52.852 --> 10:55.254
But that experience of us
being in a studio

10:55.321 --> 10:58.290
{\an5}awakened something in me.

{\an1}but I will tell you this,
since we're having a moment.

11:07.733 --> 11:08.934

like Brooke's intentions

11:34.360 --> 11:36.028

15:23.622 --> 15:26.025
call K.,
tell her I'm not a thief."

15:29.495 --> 15:30.696
{\an1}Paris...

15:30.763 --> 15:32.531
{\an1}you slapped me
in the club, sis.

15:32.598 --> 15:35.401
{\an4}Okay...

15:32.598 --> 15:35.401
{\an3}Damn...

15:35.467 --> 15:36.535
{\an7}Then you told me
you loved me.

15:36.602 --> 15:37.803
(laughter)

15:37.870 --> 15:39.838
{\an8}Moniece is here today...!

15:39.905 --> 15:41.907
{\an8}Drink, bitch, yes.

15:41.974 --> 15:44.076
She got a way
with good energy.

15:44.143 --> 15:45.878
{\an6}I'm happy.

15:44.143 --> 15:45.878
{\an1}Yes!

15:45.944 --> 15:47.746
I talked
to my baby.

15:47.813 --> 15:50.382
I had a positive talk
with Brooke.

15:50.449 --> 15:53.519
I was able to clear things
with La'Britney and Brooke,

15:53.585 --> 15:55.254
and I'm glad
that I came to London.

15:55.321 --> 15:56.655
Now the only thing
left to resolve

15:56.722 --> 16:00.526
is this weird, dead space
between me and Titi.

16:00.592 --> 16:03.228
How have you felt, like,
overall, since the,

16:03.295 --> 16:05.931
{\an1}you know, like,
the press conference and...

16:05.998 --> 16:07.299
What do you mean,
how have I felt?

16:07.366 --> 16:12.171
{\an1}I felt confused, I felt angry,
I felt mother(bleep)...

16:12.237 --> 16:13.906
{\an1}Grr...!

16:13.972 --> 16:15.941
And this brings me to a point

16:16.008 --> 16:20.679
{\an8}where I just wanna say
to you guys that, um,

16:20.746 --> 16:24.750
{\an1}especially you, Mo, there's just
certain things that sometimes,

16:24.817 --> 16:28.320
{\an1}you know, just get back
to people that I'm like...

16:28.387 --> 16:31.657
"Well, I didn't say that
to nobody but Moniece."

16:31.724 --> 16:33.659
(Moniece)
But... (sighs)

16:33.726 --> 16:39.331
Are you sure that those aren't
things that they already know?

16:39.398 --> 16:41.133
It's been numerous (bleep).

16:41.200 --> 16:43.469
Sometimes there are things

16:43.535 --> 16:45.104
that we may share
with each other

16:45.170 --> 16:46.672
that we don't think
anybody else knows,

16:46.739 --> 16:48.207
and they know.

16:48.273 --> 16:49.708
(Teairra)
I told Moniece things

16:49.775 --> 16:53.479
and she still
talked about me with Cisco

16:53.545 --> 16:54.847
and didn't even tell me.

16:54.913 --> 16:57.316
And now she's talking
about my man

16:57.383 --> 16:59.218
with mother(bleep) K. Michelle.

16:59.284 --> 17:00.786
Bitch, I don't (bleep)
with (bleep) like that.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.454
I told you that last year

17:02.521 --> 17:04.189
and I cannot get with you
like that.

17:04.256 --> 17:08.694
{\an4}And I'm just gonna say, because
this is our last night here--

17:04.256 --> 17:08.694
{\an3}Yeah.

17:08.761 --> 17:12.263
{\an1}-that I'm gonna just, like...
take a step back.

17:12.330 --> 17:16.234
{\an7}From needing support or
needing a friendship.

17:16.300 --> 17:19.505
{\an8}I mean, I was already...
feeling the same,

17:19.570 --> 17:21.707
{\an1}and I'm glad
that it's a mutual feeling,

17:21.773 --> 17:23.509
{\an5}so we're on the same page.

17:21.773 --> 17:23.509
So we're good.

17:23.575 --> 17:24.977
{\an1}(Paris)
Oh, so y'all just broke up.

17:25.042 --> 17:26.444
{\an5}You say, "It's me,
it's not you--"

17:25.042 --> 17:26.444
You broke up,

17:26.512 --> 17:27.679
{\an5}y'all broke up.

17:26.512 --> 17:27.679
--you saying it's mutual.

17:27.746 --> 17:29.648
{\an1}And you wanna be over there
with K. Michelle,

17:29.715 --> 17:32.484
{\an5}a bitch that you told me--

17:29.715 --> 17:32.484
{\an1}What does she have anything
to do with anything,

17:32.551 --> 17:33.986
like, at this moment?

17:34.052 --> 17:35.220
I'm confused,
'cause I thought

17:35.287 --> 17:36.722
we were talking
about our friendship.

17:36.789 --> 17:40.058
{\an4}I'm saying that you're friends
with a person--

17:36.789 --> 17:40.058
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

17:40.125 --> 17:43.429
{\an1}--that has falsely said
that she was

17:43.495 --> 17:45.898
{\an5}all about women empowerment--

17:43.495 --> 17:45.898
{\an3}Right.

17:45.964 --> 17:49.234
--and in this very moment,
she's sitting over there,

17:49.301 --> 17:51.670
"Hee-hee, ha-ha, hee-hee,"

17:51.737 --> 17:54.273
{\an1}with the (bleep)
that'd be with me.

17:54.339 --> 17:56.708
{\an5}(Brooke)
Hold on, Titi,
what are you doing?

17:56.775 --> 17:58.410
You breaking up with your friend

17:58.477 --> 18:01.380
because her friend Kimberly
is talking to Akbar?

18:01.447 --> 18:03.582
It sounds like Teairra
is not over the man

18:03.649 --> 18:06.084
she claimed was her abuser.

18:06.151 --> 18:09.388
{\an5}It's your mother(bleep) friend--

18:06.151 --> 18:09.388
That has nothing to do with me.

18:09.455 --> 18:10.889
{\an4}--and you should
let that bitch know--

18:09.455 --> 18:10.889
That's your situation.

18:10.956 --> 18:12.558
{\an5}No! It is yours too!

18:10.956 --> 18:12.558
That's your-- it's not.

18:12.624 --> 18:14.159
Because that's your friend.

18:14.226 --> 18:17.563
When I sit here and we say
we're taking a step back,

18:17.629 --> 18:20.365
and you feel like at times
you can't trust me,

18:20.432 --> 18:22.601
the last thing I wanna do is

18:22.668 --> 18:24.670
go sit down
with the next bitch

18:24.736 --> 18:26.638
and have a conversation
about you.

18:26.705 --> 18:28.040
That's a lose-lose!

18:28.106 --> 18:30.576
It's really unfair that I'm
the one that seems to be

18:30.642 --> 18:33.512
put on trial
for something that Kimberly did.

18:33.579 --> 18:36.448
It doesn't matter what K.
spoke to Akbar about.

18:36.515 --> 18:37.749
That's none of my business.

18:37.816 --> 18:39.151
I'm a grown-ass woman

18:39.218 --> 18:41.854
and I will decide
who I'm gonna be friends with.

18:41.920 --> 18:43.422
{\an5}So don't you ever--

18:41.920 --> 18:43.422
{\an3}For me...

18:43.489 --> 18:44.957
{\an4}--mention
my mother(bleep) name...

18:43.489 --> 18:44.957
Who are you talking to?

18:45.023 --> 18:49.261
{\an1}And if I hear you said anything
about me to K. Michelle,

18:49.328 --> 18:50.863
we gonna have a problem.

18:50.929 --> 18:52.831
No, you're not talking
to me like that.

18:52.898 --> 18:55.033
{\an5}Um, that's why you was--

18:52.898 --> 18:55.033
Well, then we're done talking.

18:55.100 --> 18:57.903
{\an1}Okay, well, then be done.
We're done.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.805
{\an5}You want this friendship--

18:57.970 --> 18:59.805
You don't need to
tell me anything.

18:59.872 --> 19:02.307
{\an1}--to be done,
it's mother(bleep) done,

19:02.374 --> 19:05.177
and it shoulda been done after
the mother(bleep) intervention.

19:05.244 --> 19:08.847
Then you should have
never called me,

19:08.914 --> 19:11.250
{\an4}you should never text back,
you should have never--

19:08.914 --> 19:11.250
{\an1}Yeah, because I was trying
to still give--

19:11.316 --> 19:12.885
{\an4}--asked me to come
to your press conference.

19:11.316 --> 19:12.885
--the friendship a chance.

19:12.951 --> 19:15.187
{\an4}And know how you love
how to play your games.

19:12.951 --> 19:15.187
{\an3}Okay.

19:15.254 --> 19:16.288
Let's let it be.

19:16.355 --> 19:17.990
{\an1}Let's let it
mother(bleep) be.

19:18.056 --> 19:19.091
{\an3}We agree.

Yeah, we mother(bleep) agree

19:20.826 --> 19:22.694

Hi. You look beautiful.

29:40.612 --> 29:41.980
(Moniece)
When I got back from London,

29:42.046 --> 29:45.049
Brooke hit me and said she had
an abundance of evidence

29:45.116 --> 29:47.252
that would
support my suspicions

29:47.318 --> 29:50.155
that Teairra was still in fact
involved with Akbar.

29:50.221 --> 29:53.992
I think I'll let Brooke
spill all the tea to Kimberly.

29:54.058 --> 29:55.760
She just telling me
about Paris.

29:55.827 --> 29:56.895
She wants to talk to you.

29:56.961 --> 29:59.197
{\an1}That's what it all
boiled down to.

29:59.264 --> 30:00.999
{\an5}That's that.

29:59.264 --> 30:00.999
{\an3}Oh, my God.

30:01.065 --> 30:02.901
{\an5}Take me to the next point.

30:01.065 --> 30:02.901
{\an3}What?

30:02.967 --> 30:06.437
{\an1}In London,
one of the deejays

30:06.504 --> 30:09.474
{\an1}said something
about you being on Live

30:09.541 --> 30:11.476
and kiki-ing with Akbar.

30:11.543 --> 30:13.144
Teairra got mad
and stormed off.

30:13.211 --> 30:15.213
I'm sorry that you're angry,

30:15.280 --> 30:17.081
but I have no loyalty
towards you

30:17.148 --> 30:19.217
and on top of it, like,

30:19.284 --> 30:21.052
I don't know what
happened with you and him.

30:21.119 --> 30:22.954
{\an8}Right.

30:21.119 --> 30:22.954
{\an8}He said, "I didn't do it."

30:23.021 --> 30:24.722
That's all I know.

30:26.457 --> 30:27.492
{\an3}What?

30:27.559 --> 30:29.627
I met up with Akbar as well.

30:29.694 --> 30:30.895
You met up with him.

30:30.962 --> 30:31.963
Yeah, I did.

30:32.030 --> 30:33.264
{\an1}Oh!

30:33.331 --> 30:37.302
So... here's the plane ticket
from Akbar,

30:37.368 --> 30:39.737
'cause he told me
that she flew out

30:39.804 --> 30:41.573
after the press conference
to see him

30:41.639 --> 30:43.675
shortly before
we left for London.

30:43.741 --> 30:46.077
Oh, so she went
after the Lisa Bloom.

30:46.144 --> 30:48.413
After all of that.

30:48.479 --> 30:50.081
{\an6}Oh!

30:48.479 --> 30:50.081
So here's another, uh, video.

30:50.148 --> 30:52.317
That's Akbar, you know,
taking her back to the airport

30:52.383 --> 30:54.586
{\an5}so she can fly on back to L.A.

30:52.383 --> 30:54.586
Ooh, 'cause you
like that bitch.

30:54.652 --> 30:58.256

to London and not missing...

30:58.323 --> 30:59.724

31:02.560 --> 31:05.863
I can't believe what Brooke
is saying to me right now.

31:05.930 --> 31:08.066
She and I both stood
at the press conference

31:08.132 --> 31:10.201
and empathized with Teairra
as a victim.

31:10.268 --> 31:12.804
But now I find out
she's sleeping with the enemy

31:12.870 --> 31:17.709
and I have to sit and question
Teairra's entire story to me.

31:17.775 --> 31:18.743
I'm tired of talking
about Teairra.

31:18.810 --> 31:19.978
