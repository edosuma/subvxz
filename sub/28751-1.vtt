- Hey.
- Shhhhhh. Quiet.

02:07.001 --> 02:09.211
Here, catch.

02:10.086 --> 02:12.297
- Good morning.
- Babe,

02:12.673 --> 02:14.633
- see you at school.
- Okay.

02:17.428 --> 02:19.096
See ya, Franky.

02:19.639 --> 02:20.764
Bye.

02:23.164 --> 02:25.249
GIANT

02:25.250 --> 02:29.212
LITTLE ONES

02:31.734 --> 02:34.027
We did it six times.

02:34.445 --> 02:36.655
- Six times?
- Uh-huh.

02:36.656 --> 02:38.990
- All the way?
- Yep.

02:38.991 --> 02:40.742
No way.

02:45.331 --> 02:48.291
Right to the wall.

02:50.920 --> 02:53.296
Reach. Reach.

03:00.972 --> 03:03.849
<i>Who calls the law
of conservation of energy?</i>

03:03.850 --> 03:05.642
What's up with those two this morning?

03:05.643 --> 03:07.602
<i>Energy cannot be created...</i>

03:07.770 --> 03:09.646
Call of the wild.

03:10.106 --> 03:11.189
Priscilla,

03:11.190 --> 03:12.774
are you with us?

03:19.157 --> 03:20.574
Dude.

03:20.908 --> 03:23.368
These girls want it
just as much as you guys do.

03:23.369 --> 03:25.453
You should hear them
talking in the bathroom.

03:25.454 --> 03:27.330
Cil included.

03:27.665 --> 03:31.459
Cil has got a seriously fine rack.

03:32.211 --> 03:34.045
I would do her in a second.

03:34.046 --> 03:34.963
<i>Glasses on.</i>

03:34.964 --> 03:37.299
- You need to get laid.
- Tell me about it.

03:37.300 --> 03:39.801
<i>Okay, now pay close attention,</i>

03:39.802 --> 03:41.970
<i>'cause this is all
gonna happen very quickly.</i>

03:43.681 --> 03:45.640
- Wow. That's so cool.
- Duuude!

03:45.933 --> 03:47.976
It's like magic.

04:15.026 --> 04:18.071
SLUT

04:36.317 --> 04:37.817
Franky...

04:42.114 --> 04:44.950
Franky, is there
something wrong with me?

04:44.951 --> 04:47.285
What? No, you're great.

04:48.371 --> 04:50.705
Is there someone you like better?

04:51.165 --> 04:53.833
No, I'm totally into you.

05:03.594 --> 05:06.179
I was thinking I could stay
overnight at your place

05:06.180 --> 05:08.014
after your birthday party.

05:08.391 --> 05:10.892
I can tell my parents
I'm staying at Jess'.

05:10.893 --> 05:13.270
That'd be awesome
if you could stay over.

05:15.648 --> 05:18.149
You can make yourself bald
doing that, y'know.

05:18.150 --> 05:20.360
- Can not.
- You can. I read it online.

05:20.361 --> 05:23.154
"Bald teenage girls".
It's an epidemic.

05:23.155 --> 05:25.156
Shut-up, weirdo.

05:25.157 --> 05:26.700
Come on, we're gonna be late for class.

05:26.701 --> 05:28.994
Hey, don't wear him out too much, Jess,

05:28.995 --> 05:30.996
- he's competing tonight.
- Ballas!

05:30.997 --> 05:32.872
He's gotta save his strength.

05:32.873 --> 05:34.374
You're so dead, Franky!

05:34.375 --> 05:36.710
Fast in bed
does not mean fast in the pool!

05:36.711 --> 05:38.253
Come here!

05:39.505 --> 05:42.757
That is so beyond childish.

05:42.758 --> 05:44.384
I dunno.

05:44.385 --> 05:46.428
I think it's kinda cute.

06:24.675 --> 06:26.843
Alright, here you go, boys, let's go!

06:35.144 --> 06:37.062
Positions!

06:38.314 --> 06:40.315
On your marks...

07:11.388 --> 07:13.181
Why don't you fucking grow up?

07:13.182 --> 07:15.850
Oh, I'm sorry, Michael, did that hurt?

07:16.352 --> 07:18.186
Fucking moron.

07:19.146 --> 07:21.106
Anyway, you probably like it.

07:21.107 --> 07:23.608
Isn't that the kind of thing
your type likes?

07:25.903 --> 07:27.570
You know what I wonder, Connor?

07:27.571 --> 07:28.571
What?

07:28.572 --> 07:30.865
I wonder why you prance around
in your underwear

07:30.866 --> 07:32.826
whipping the ass of another guy.

07:32.827 --> 07:34.994
Is there something
you're trying to tell us?

07:37.623 --> 07:40.083
Fuck you, faggot.

07:40.459 --> 07:42.585
If you wanna go there,
I'll get you kicked off this team

07:42.586 --> 07:44.379
so fast you won't know
what fucking hit you.

07:44.380 --> 07:47.382
You won't know
what the fuck hit you, bitch.

07:47.383 --> 07:49.008
- Hey, chill out, Connor.
- You chill out.

07:49.009 --> 07:50.885
Hey, back the fuck off.

07:55.099 --> 07:56.724
Whatever, man.

07:57.977 --> 07:59.519
We're cool.

08:03.732 --> 08:06.067
You guys should remember
you're on a team together.

08:06.068 --> 08:07.902
Okay, thanks, "team captain".

08:20.875 --> 08:23.543
Happy birthday, my beautiful boy.

08:23.544 --> 08:25.253
Mom, it's Saturday.

08:25.254 --> 08:27.380
Yeah, but I have to get to the studio,

08:27.381 --> 08:29.549
and I wanted to say
happy birthday first.

08:29.550 --> 08:32.302
I can't believe how big
my little boy's getting.

08:32.303 --> 08:33.303
Mom, gross,

08:33.304 --> 08:36.181
his bed's probably totally
covered with his nasty boy goop.

08:36.182 --> 08:37.265
Shut-up, Ho.

08:37.265 --> 08:39.475
I can hear you in here.
It's disgusting.

08:39.476 --> 08:42.102
Bullshit, it's your vibrator
that makes all the noise.

08:42.104 --> 08:43.730
Oh, as if, creeper!

08:43.731 --> 08:44.939
Deanne...

08:44.940 --> 08:47.025
Happy birthday, douche bag.

08:47.443 --> 08:49.777
- Thanks, Sis.
- You're welcome.

08:49.778 --> 08:51.362
So what did you poison this with?

08:51.363 --> 08:53.031
You'll find out.

08:53.449 --> 08:54.616
It's so gross.

08:54.617 --> 08:56.868
I'm only doing this 'cause
it's your birthday, alright?

08:56.869 --> 08:59.037
- Deanne, you'll be home at eight, right?
- Uh-huh.

08:59.038 --> 09:00.497
Ah! C'mon!

09:00.498 --> 09:03.208
Hey, we've discussed this,
no Deanne, no party.

09:03.209 --> 09:04.626
FYI, I'm not totally psyched

09:04.627 --> 09:06.794
to be baby-sitting you and
your douche bag friends, ya know.

09:06.795 --> 09:09.756
I'm giving you some leeway tonight,
Franky. Use wisely.

09:09.757 --> 09:11.549
This isn't gonna be some big blowout,

09:11.550 --> 09:14.302
where all the kids do drugs
and puke all over the house.

09:14.303 --> 09:16.846
I'm gonna be home at one sharp
and it needs to be wrapped up.

09:16.847 --> 09:18.431
- You going on a date tonight?
- Maybe.

09:18.432 --> 09:20.391
Yes. Double date.

09:20.392 --> 09:21.893
Rebecca and Jerry's friend.

09:21.894 --> 09:23.895
He's supposed to be nice. I dunno.

09:23.896 --> 09:27.106
Don't forget to reply to your father
about dinner tomorrow night,

09:27.107 --> 09:28.024
okay?

09:28.025 --> 09:30.443
He thinks
I'm influencing your decision.

09:30.444 --> 09:31.819
He's just been paranoid.

09:31.820 --> 09:33.738
He wants to see you
on your birthday, Franky!

09:33.739 --> 09:35.448
Just answer him, okay?

09:36.659 --> 09:38.535
You have nice lips, mom.

09:38.536 --> 09:40.787
Thank you baby, so do you.

09:40.788 --> 09:42.080
Okay.

09:42.081 --> 09:45.458
Hottest single mom out there.

09:45.459 --> 09:46.834
Watch out.

09:46.835 --> 09:48.461
Charmer.

09:54.635 --> 09:56.427
Hey, birthday boy!

09:56.428 --> 09:58.012
- Franky.
- Hey!

09:58.013 --> 09:59.472
You ready for your party?

09:59.473 --> 10:00.598
Pretty much.

10:00.599 --> 10:02.684
There's muffins in the kitchen,
just help yourself.

10:02.685 --> 10:04.060
Okay, thanks.

10:16.615 --> 10:18.116
Hey, 'Tash.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.202
I'm waiting for Ballas.

10:39.096 --> 10:42.098
You know Ballas and I are going
uptown to get booze for tonight.

10:49.523 --> 10:52.525
Natasha, you're totally welcome
to come to my party tonight

10:52.526 --> 10:54.068
if you want.

10:55.112 --> 10:58.323
Franky, why on earth would
I want to come to your party?

11:00.743 --> 11:02.118
Just offering.

11:02.828 --> 11:04.621
Do what you want.

11:04.622 --> 11:06.414
Yeah, I will.

11:08.542 --> 11:09.626
Hey, man.

11:09.627 --> 11:10.752
Hey.

11:14.548 --> 11:16.049
Let's go.

11:16.050 --> 11:17.050
Yeah.

11:19.470 --> 11:21.429
I thought you liked Cil.

11:21.805 --> 11:23.723
I mean she's nice, but...

11:23.724 --> 11:25.642
she doesn't have anything to say.

11:25.643 --> 11:27.185
And?

11:27.186 --> 11:29.145
Well, have you ever noticed the way

11:29.146 --> 11:30.396
she twirls her hair?

11:30.397 --> 11:32.023
Yeah, she's got nice hair.

11:32.024 --> 11:35.360
She doesn't want Mr. Nice Guy.
She wants Mr. Guy Guy.

11:36.487 --> 11:37.570
Dude,

11:37.571 --> 11:38.780
it's your birthday.

11:38.781 --> 11:40.531
She's hot and she wants
to spend the night!

11:40.532 --> 11:42.992
It couldn't be more perfect, Franky!

11:44.953 --> 11:46.079
Am I right

11:46.080 --> 11:47.705
or am I totally right?

11:47.706 --> 11:50.375
You're right.
Just stop doing that, please.

12:56.108 --> 12:58.735
Is everything ready for tonight?

12:59.528 --> 13:00.778
Yes.

13:00.779 --> 13:03.448
Everything's ready. It's all ready.

13:04.616 --> 13:05.658
Okay.

13:05.659 --> 13:06.951
It's all good.

13:09.079 --> 13:10.538
Condoms?

13:11.415 --> 13:14.375
We're not doing it without condoms.

13:14.376 --> 13:15.918
Of course we're not, of course.

13:17.463 --> 13:20.381
I have condom's, yes.

13:21.425 --> 13:22.884
Okay.

13:26.597 --> 13:29.140
I don't think
I'm gonna need all these.

13:30.559 --> 13:32.310
Got you something.

13:34.021 --> 13:36.731
You wrapped it and everything.

13:36.732 --> 13:39.317
Only the best for my bro.

13:42.404 --> 13:43.821
What the...

13:48.243 --> 13:49.785
It's a flare gun.

13:49.786 --> 13:51.746
Bought it off Trevor Hallis.

13:51.747 --> 13:54.373
Stoner stole it from his dad's boat.

13:54.750 --> 13:56.125
Cool.

13:56.543 --> 13:58.419
Thanks, bro.

13:58.420 --> 13:59.837
Nah.

14:00.881 --> 14:03.049
Hey, how you getting Cil
in here anyway?

14:03.050 --> 14:04.675
The window. Oh shit.

14:04.676 --> 14:07.637
That reminds me,
I gotta take the screen off.

14:08.096 --> 14:09.347
Hey.

14:10.057 --> 14:11.432
Thanks.

14:12.434 --> 14:13.768
You know how to use 'em?

14:13.769 --> 14:15.311
Yeah, I'll figure it out.

14:29.117 --> 14:31.661
<i>We were just about to go!</i>

14:31.662 --> 14:33.663
<i>That's so not fair!</i>

14:34.373 --> 14:37.625
Why? Why?

14:38.001 --> 14:39.835
<i>It's one time!</i>

14:39.836 --> 14:40.878
Just say no.

14:41.088 --> 14:43.839
No! I'm already here.

14:43.840 --> 14:45.841
- Just hang up.
- Why?

14:47.135 --> 14:48.427
Shit.

14:49.846 --> 14:51.722
What're you doing Franky?

14:51.723 --> 14:53.099
Hey, just...

14:53.100 --> 14:54.684
trying to...

14:54.685 --> 14:56.310
take this screen off.

14:56.311 --> 14:59.272
Franky, I have to go home!

14:59.273 --> 15:00.856
This was supposed to be our night.

15:00.857 --> 15:02.024
You're 16.

15:02.025 --> 15:03.776
It's ridiculous
how they still monitor you.

15:03.777 --> 15:05.653
I know! She's ruining my life!

15:05.654 --> 15:07.113
- Where's Franky?
- He's right here.

15:07.114 --> 15:08.322
- Oh my God.
- Hey.

15:08.323 --> 15:10.866
Franky, Mom's on her way,
let's go! Now.

15:10.867 --> 15:12.368
Come on everyone, let's go.

15:12.369 --> 15:13.494
Oh shit.

15:13.495 --> 15:14.537
Okay.

15:14.538 --> 15:16.122
Party's over, go, go!

15:16.123 --> 15:17.540
Everybody's gotta go!

15:21.253 --> 15:23.546
Go! You guys gotta go!

15:23.880 --> 15:27.133
- Get down from the tree!
- Go, go!

15:34.016 --> 15:35.349
Hi, Mom.

15:35.350 --> 15:37.226
- Hi, Mrs. Winter.
- Good party?

15:37.227 --> 15:38.561
Pretty good.

15:38.562 --> 15:39.854
Good!

15:41.565 --> 15:43.274
Lots of pizza.

15:43.942 --> 15:45.901
Yeah, lots of pizza.

16:23.899 --> 16:26.275
Hey! Who is that?

16:26.276 --> 16:28.819
Get outta here or I'll call the cops!

16:35.535 --> 16:37.370
Little late to be out?

16:38.664 --> 16:39.872
What's that?

16:39.873 --> 16:42.208
It's a little late to be out, isn't it?

16:42.668 --> 16:44.293
Not really, no.

16:46.254 --> 16:48.506
Here's your boyfriend.

16:49.091 --> 16:50.508
Hey, come on.

16:50.509 --> 16:52.051
Who are these dicks?

16:52.052 --> 16:52.968
I don't know. Come on.

16:52.969 --> 16:54.762
What're you girls whispering about?

16:55.681 --> 16:57.473
Fuckin' losers, man.

17:00.310 --> 17:03.104
Fuck it, dude,
we should get outta here, okay?

17:44.604 --> 17:46.897
Get those fuckers!

17:47.482 --> 17:49.567
Go field, field!

17:49.568 --> 17:51.277
Left, left, left!

18:04.166 --> 18:06.292
This way, you freak!

18:18.805 --> 18:20.139
That is...

18:20.140 --> 18:21.974
Holy shit.

18:26.897 --> 18:29.106
Man, that is sick!

19:38.135 --> 19:39.468
Hey.

19:42.305 --> 19:43.973
Hey, just wait a second.

19:46.685 --> 19:48.352
Ballas, wait!

20:13.859 --> 20:17.279
<i>"Sorry about last night :(
Too bad we're still virgins :(:(:(".</i>

21:18.860 --> 21:20.694
Never would have happened...

21:28.620 --> 21:31.330
It never would have happened
if we weren't wasted.

21:40.298 --> 21:42.258
See my chain and heart?

21:42.801 --> 21:44.760
You know, the one Jess gave me?

21:45.492 --> 21:46.868
No.

21:47.555 --> 21:49.765
Fucking lost it last night, man.

21:50.725 --> 21:52.977
She's gonna freak if she finds out.

21:57.983 --> 21:59.650
Keep an eye out for it, okay?

22:02.779 --> 22:04.029
Okay.

22:36.001 --> 22:37.002
DAD

23:20.857 --> 23:22.775
He sent dessert for you and mom.

23:22.776 --> 23:26.612
Franky, probably now is a good time
to grow up and quit being such a jerk.

23:26.613 --> 23:28.822
Probably now is a good time
to mind your fucking business.

23:28.823 --> 23:31.700
- You're making this worse for everyone.
- Who asked you?

23:57.685 --> 24:00.187
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:01.523 --> 24:03.482
Are you gonna break up with me?

24:04.172 --> 24:05.567
No.

24:05.568 --> 24:07.444
Oh, God.

24:07.445 --> 24:09.863
I thought... nine-thirty
on a Sunday night,

24:09.864 --> 24:12.032
why else would you be here?

24:12.033 --> 24:13.992
No, I just wanted to see you.

24:15.662 --> 24:17.204
That's nice.

24:18.915 --> 24:21.750
I was thinking about how
our plans got messed up last night.

24:21.751 --> 24:24.545
I'm still so pissed at my parents.

24:25.171 --> 24:27.214
I was thinking...

24:28.091 --> 24:30.676
maybe we could go to the park.

24:30.677 --> 24:32.177
The park?

24:32.637 --> 24:33.929
Yeah.

24:34.764 --> 24:36.348
To have sex?

24:37.559 --> 24:38.976
Yeah.

24:38.977 --> 24:42.479
We're not gonna have sex
at the park, Franky.

24:42.480 --> 24:44.148
What are you thinking?

24:44.149 --> 24:46.567
I don't know, I just thought maybe...

24:47.652 --> 24:49.069
you...

24:51.948 --> 24:53.782
Sometime this week.

24:54.909 --> 24:57.578
One night, when we
can be alone at your place.

25:01.666 --> 25:03.375
My mom...

25:03.376 --> 25:05.961
She's decided you're a bad influence.

25:07.422 --> 25:09.214
Maybe she's right.

25:10.425 --> 25:11.925
Kiss me then.

25:12.510 --> 25:15.471
Let's give her something
she can really worry about.

25:25.106 --> 25:26.690
Get some rest.

25:26.691 --> 25:28.233
You look tired.

25:33.281 --> 25:35.908
- Night.
- Night.

25:49.088 --> 25:50.797
Where'd you go?

25:51.112 --> 25:52.656
Cil's.

25:53.468 --> 25:56.094
Nice girl. Don't mess that up.

26:03.186 --> 26:06.063
I never got the chance to ask you
how your date went last night?

26:07.524 --> 26:09.358
I spent the whole night...

26:09.359 --> 26:12.778
hoping the restaurant would
catch fire, so I could flee.

26:12.779 --> 26:14.154
Right...

26:14.155 --> 26:15.989
Not so good then.

26:16.491 --> 26:18.325
Not so much.

26:19.702 --> 26:22.246
Sounds like your party
was the place to be.

26:23.081 --> 26:24.373
Yeah.

26:26.292 --> 26:28.293
Somebody better will show up.

26:34.092 --> 26:36.426
Your dad sent this dessert home.

26:36.427 --> 26:38.637
If you don't eat it tonight,
put it in the fridge.

26:40.390 --> 26:42.140
- Goodnight babe.
- Night.

27:00.118 --> 27:03.287
Hey, you guys, come on in, join us.
Back here, let's go.

27:03.288 --> 27:04.997
Everybody join in.

27:06.541 --> 27:08.542
Okay, I want you to listen up.

27:08.876 --> 27:11.086
It seems some of you

27:11.087 --> 27:14.172
have forgotten that we have
strict anti harassment policies.

27:14.799 --> 27:18.302
Members of a team treat
each other with respect.

27:19.887 --> 27:21.263
Now,

27:21.806 --> 27:24.057
Michael has requested that

27:24.058 --> 27:27.769
he have access to the change room
without some of you being there.

27:28.146 --> 27:32.691
I don't like this divisiveness
that it brings to the team,

27:32.692 --> 27:33.692
but if

27:33.693 --> 27:36.111
Michael and some of you
are uncomfortable,

27:36.112 --> 27:37.946
then it might be for the best.

27:38.448 --> 27:41.950
We've spent a lot of time
and energy building this team,

27:41.951 --> 27:43.910
so cut the crap.

27:45.538 --> 27:48.832
Okay, Michael and anyone else
who wants to, you can go now.

27:48.833 --> 27:51.460
Anyone who wants to wait,
go ahead and wait.

27:52.837 --> 27:55.672
Everybody in the pool,
ten minutes, let's go.

28:22.450 --> 28:24.743
Reach! Reach!

28:25.828 --> 28:28.372
Stop taking breaks over there,
let's keep going!

28:41.386 --> 28:43.345
I'm going to hang out with Jess.

29:07.537 --> 29:11.039
Hey, just so you know...
I just got my period.

29:11.874 --> 29:13.291
Okay.

29:13.584 --> 29:17.421
Well, it's not like we'd do anything
with your mom and sister here, anyway.

29:17.880 --> 29:19.256
I know.

29:20.007 --> 29:22.134
I just wanted to kiss you.

29:23.719 --> 29:25.053
Okay.

29:34.647 --> 29:37.441
Oh my gosh, that's so cute.

29:37.442 --> 29:39.734
I want a dog like that.

30:32.413 --> 30:33.622
Hey.

30:34.957 --> 30:36.166
What're you doing?

30:36.167 --> 30:37.334
Moving lockers.

30:37.335 --> 30:40.045
- What for?
- Why the hell do you think, Franky?

30:40.630 --> 30:42.923
- Take this.
- Ballas, what's going on?

30:42.924 --> 30:44.633
Do you have any idea
how this feels for me?

30:44.634 --> 30:47.219
- Don't play innocent. We know.
- Quiet.

30:47.220 --> 30:49.679
Now I know why you didn't
wanna have sex with me.

30:49.680 --> 30:51.348
We haven't had the chance yet.

30:51.349 --> 30:52.390
Stop lying.

30:52.391 --> 30:54.017
I just gotta focus
on school and swim team.

30:54.018 --> 30:55.519
Hey, are you fucking for real?

30:55.520 --> 30:56.853
- Stop it.
- You stop it.

30:56.854 --> 30:58.313
It's over, Franky.

30:58.314 --> 30:59.523
Who the fuck are you?

30:59.524 --> 31:01.316
I'm his girlfriend! Who are you?

31:01.317 --> 31:03.485
- Both of you guys, shut-up!
- Priscilla!

31:03.486 --> 31:05.237
Ballas, come on.

31:05.905 --> 31:07.989
Just leave it, Franky, okay?

31:58.229 --> 32:00.690
YOU ARE THIS GAY

32:00.876 --> 32:02.460
You gotta own it.

32:02.461 --> 32:03.753
Own what?

32:03.754 --> 32:05.130
That you're queer.

32:05.131 --> 32:06.756
I'm not queer.

32:06.757 --> 32:07.924
Come on,

32:07.925 --> 32:13.138
you and Ballas did something that
straight guys don't normally do.

32:14.432 --> 32:16.016
Show up tomorrow

32:16.017 --> 32:17.559
head held high,

32:17.560 --> 32:19.436
middle finger salute raised...

32:19.437 --> 32:21.313
'hello and fuck you',
to anyone who says shit

32:21.314 --> 32:23.398
and they'll realize
they can't get at you.

32:24.525 --> 32:26.401
Look at Walter Tang.

32:26.402 --> 32:29.279
That dude has been wearing
mascara and like

32:29.280 --> 32:32.991
more jewelry than the queen of
freakin' England since seventh grade

32:32.992 --> 32:36.119
and no one says shit about it,
because he owns it.

32:42.918 --> 32:45.086
What is that?

32:45.087 --> 32:46.588
It's a sock-cock.

32:48.090 --> 32:50.467
Tube sock wrapped in elastics.

32:50.926 --> 32:52.677
Stop grabbing it, please.

32:52.678 --> 32:55.096
Why... why do you have that?

32:55.097 --> 32:57.223
Because it feels right.

32:57.224 --> 32:59.809
I'm a girl who likes to pack, so what?

32:59.810 --> 33:01.853
You're getting weirder by the day.

33:01.854 --> 33:04.230
Well, apparently,
so are you, bro, so...

33:05.399 --> 33:06.816
Now I know why you guys...

33:06.817 --> 33:09.152
walk around with your hands
in your pockets all day.

33:10.946 --> 33:12.447
You're holding your dicks.

33:12.448 --> 33:14.449
No, we're not holding our dicks.

33:14.450 --> 33:15.825
Yeah, you are.

33:40.768 --> 33:42.769
This is such bullshit.

33:50.319 --> 33:52.362
Hey, you missed your turn, Franky.

33:52.363 --> 33:54.364
Get out and wait 'til we're done.

35:10.608 --> 35:12.233
I thought...

35:13.319 --> 35:15.653
I thought it was supposed

35:16.072 --> 35:20.200
to be socially acceptable
these days for kids to experiment.

35:21.494 --> 35:22.952
What?

35:23.579 --> 35:25.789
I'm sorry, isn't that what people say?

35:25.790 --> 35:27.624
We didn't experiment.

35:32.296 --> 35:35.340
Well, your father suddenly decided
he was gay, so, who knows?

35:35.341 --> 35:36.758
He didn't suddenly decide!

35:36.759 --> 35:39.594
Well, he certainly wasn't gay
when I married him!

35:43.140 --> 35:44.849
Sorry.

35:49.146 --> 35:52.148
Anyway, he's coming over tonight
to talk to you.

35:52.149 --> 35:54.025
You told him?

35:54.026 --> 35:56.778
Of course I told him.
He's your father.

35:56.779 --> 35:59.572
Just 'cause daddy's gay
doesn't mean Franky is.

35:59.573 --> 36:02.575
- No shit, Deanne.
- I'm not fucking gay.

36:09.875 --> 36:11.793
Nice one, mom.

36:12.461 --> 36:14.087
Shut it!

36:21.303 --> 36:24.097
You know, I have a pretty good idea
of what you're going through.

36:25.850 --> 36:28.476
I mean, we've both had friends
turn against us.

36:30.688 --> 36:32.021
The thing I realized...

36:32.022 --> 36:34.149
If you're gonna say you realized
they weren't your real friends,

36:34.150 --> 36:35.108
please don't.

36:38.028 --> 36:40.280
Well, that is what I realized.

36:42.867 --> 36:45.535
You two were very close.

36:50.499 --> 36:53.376
What's the deal with all
the cushions on your couch?

36:54.003 --> 36:55.545
I'm sorry?

36:56.255 --> 36:58.047
All those cushions on

36:58.048 --> 37:00.466
on your 'designer sofa'.

37:01.635 --> 37:04.721
I mean, how do you even sit on it
with that many cushions.

37:05.556 --> 37:07.640
It's kind of ridiculous,
if you ask me.

37:07.641 --> 37:10.310
How is it you know
so much about my couch

37:10.311 --> 37:14.189
when you've refused every
invitation to come to my home?

37:14.690 --> 37:16.733
Deanne showed me pictures.

37:16.817 --> 37:19.110
Not that I cared.

37:19.111 --> 37:20.737
Talk about gay...

37:20.738 --> 37:22.071
What?

37:22.406 --> 37:24.032
What?

37:26.493 --> 37:28.786
Couches aren't gay, Franky.

37:29.496 --> 37:31.247
Okay, whatever, it's just a word.

37:31.248 --> 37:33.917
Yeah, that means homosexual,
not whatever vague meaning

37:33.918 --> 37:36.711
people pretend to give it just
to pass off their homophobia.

37:36.712 --> 37:38.755
Oh my god, you should write a book.

37:38.756 --> 37:40.423
You should read a book.

37:41.300 --> 37:42.967
The one I gave you for instance.

37:42.968 --> 37:44.677
Yeah, it was boring.

37:45.054 --> 37:47.347
Franky, your whole attitude
is getting boring.

37:47.348 --> 37:48.556
Fine.

37:48.557 --> 37:50.600
- Franky!
- I didn't ask to sit out here.

37:50.601 --> 37:52.393
Franky, come on, man!

37:54.063 --> 37:56.272
- Franky!
- What?

38:00.319 --> 38:01.778
Whatever.

38:10.246 --> 38:11.621
Hey.

38:12.581 --> 38:14.499
Were you two fighting?

38:15.398 --> 38:16.774
No.

38:19.588 --> 38:21.047
Yeah.

38:25.719 --> 38:27.220
I found this on the floor.

38:27.221 --> 38:29.055
Someone from your party?

38:48.014 --> 38:50.016
LOVE YOU FOREVER

39:32.703 --> 39:35.038
- Ballas.
- What?

39:35.039 --> 39:37.874
We've been best friends
for most of our lives.

39:39.001 --> 39:42.003
There's nothing you can't tell me.

39:42.463 --> 39:44.547
Okay, whatever. Is that it?

39:46.884 --> 39:48.301
Ballas...

39:49.887 --> 39:51.846
What'd you tell Jess?

39:54.933 --> 39:57.477
I woke up
and you were sucking my dick.

39:59.313 --> 40:00.521
Dude...

40:01.273 --> 40:03.024
that's not what happened.

40:05.486 --> 40:06.778
Ballas?

40:06.779 --> 40:08.196
Hey, go home.

40:08.197 --> 40:09.655
What's going on here?

40:09.656 --> 40:11.199
Get the fuck outta here.

40:11.200 --> 40:13.076
You went down on me.

40:13.077 --> 40:14.452
Get the fuck outta here!

40:14.453 --> 40:15.953
Get your fucking bike and go!

40:15.954 --> 40:18.081
Fuck outta here. Get outta here!

40:18.082 --> 40:19.707
What the hell's going on?
Come on, what's going on?

40:19.708 --> 40:20.792
Franky, what's going on?

40:20.793 --> 40:23.252
Why'd you say anything to her at all?

40:23.587 --> 40:25.213
Jesus!

40:30.928 --> 40:32.512
Okay, okay,

40:32.513 --> 40:34.680
let's just all go inside.

40:34.681 --> 40:36.099
Come on.

41:13.971 --> 41:15.179
Hey.

41:18.058 --> 41:19.392
Hey.

41:24.189 --> 41:27.108
Ballas says you quit swim team.

41:28.986 --> 41:31.154
Yeah, I was never really into it.

41:33.574 --> 41:36.826
You do realize he's just doing
what he's always done, right?

41:38.954 --> 41:40.872
Do you remember...

41:40.873 --> 41:44.167
when the three of us
stole those strawberries?

41:44.585 --> 41:45.793
Yeah.

41:45.794 --> 41:47.962
And then when we got caught

41:47.963 --> 41:50.631
how he denied being apart of it

41:50.632 --> 41:53.134
even though his hands and mouth

41:53.427 --> 41:56.012
were covered in strawberry juice.

41:59.371 --> 42:01.434
Or,

42:01.435 --> 42:04.604
when you two lit a trash can on fire?

42:04.605 --> 42:07.940
Franky, he swore up and down
he wasn't with you,

42:07.941 --> 42:10.735
until my mom finds the lighter
in his pocket.

42:15.073 --> 42:17.325
Now he's saying he wasn't awake.

42:20.120 --> 42:21.245
I mean...

42:21.246 --> 42:25.708
Jess is running around making sure
everyone knows her boyfriend's straight.

42:27.753 --> 42:30.129
People are writing shit on my locker.

42:32.341 --> 42:34.800
Well, don't believe everything you read.

42:35.594 --> 42:36.928
For example...

42:36.929 --> 42:38.513
between you and me...

42:39.431 --> 42:42.850
I never blew the seventh grade twelves
in the parking lot.

42:49.816 --> 42:52.026
Anyway,

42:52.694 --> 42:55.613
if you get bored or lonely or something,

42:55.614 --> 43:00.368
I hear the Anime club
takes pretty much anyone.

43:00.369 --> 43:03.663
And those doey eyes of yours
would be a huge hit.

43:51.420 --> 43:53.588
<i>"To Tash: Want to hangout?
Cool if you don't."</i>

44:58.362 --> 45:00.279
You're a genius.

45:02.157 --> 45:04.950
I guess I never really
told you this, but, umm...

45:04.951 --> 45:08.079
I like how you cut your hair
these days. It's very cool.

45:08.080 --> 45:09.372
Thanks.

45:10.749 --> 45:12.875
Let me see your tongue.

45:14.711 --> 45:16.629
- Good?
- Yeah.

45:17.422 --> 45:20.800
Do you remember the time
you puked on my parents' CD?

45:21.593 --> 45:24.303
Yeah, that was from the flu.
But yes, I remember.

45:24.304 --> 45:25.346
No way!

45:25.347 --> 45:27.932
Yeah, I was bed-ridden
for three days after that.

45:27.933 --> 45:30.601
- I even hallucinated.
- Really?

45:30.602 --> 45:32.395
Yeah, I hallucinated once.

45:32.396 --> 45:34.021
On 'shrooms.

45:34.022 --> 45:36.190
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

45:36.191 --> 45:38.484
I decided to go for a walk and

45:38.985 --> 45:43.614
I saw this like this
amazing garden in someone's yard,

45:43.615 --> 45:46.575
and I went in and this little
old lady was in there.

45:46.576 --> 45:48.744
I was so high

45:48.745 --> 45:50.705
that I was completely convinced...

45:50.706 --> 45:53.124
the flowers were like smiling at me.

45:53.125 --> 45:55.251
And then,
I look up at the old lady and

45:55.252 --> 45:59.255
her cheeks turn into these like
two tiny bunches of little roses,

45:59.256 --> 46:02.341
right in front of my eyes,
so I'm like freaking out

46:02.342 --> 46:05.219
and then her face becomes
this one giant rose,

46:05.220 --> 46:08.764
and the middle of it's like her mouth,
and it was like talking to me.

46:09.141 --> 46:11.392
She was so nice, Franky.

46:11.393 --> 46:13.102
I didn't want to leave

46:13.103 --> 46:15.896
because I thought she was super lonely

46:15.897 --> 46:18.524
and had no one,
like no family or anything.

46:18.525 --> 46:20.234
Maybe she was.

46:22.988 --> 46:24.321
Well, uh, no,

46:24.322 --> 46:25.656
'cause after a while

46:25.657 --> 46:28.409
she said her son and grand-kids
were coming to visit,

46:28.410 --> 46:30.453
and that it was time for me to go,

46:30.454 --> 46:34.665
and all of a sudden I realized
it was me that was really lonely,

46:35.375 --> 46:37.126
and I started to cry.

46:40.213 --> 46:41.922
She was really nice
about it though, you know.

46:41.923 --> 46:44.133
She kept patting my back

46:44.134 --> 46:47.136
and saying, "There, there, dear.
It'll be all right.

46:47.137 --> 46:48.804
You'll see".

46:49.681 --> 46:51.223
Now I've been thinking lately

46:51.224 --> 46:53.851
I wanna find that garden again.

46:53.852 --> 46:55.978
Tell her I'm okay.

46:58.231 --> 46:59.857
Are you okay?

47:01.985 --> 47:03.694
I mean...

47:03.695 --> 47:05.780
you wouldn't think so.

47:11.328 --> 47:15.206
I'm really sorry I didn't say anything
when you got back to school after...

47:16.625 --> 47:18.584
you'd been away.

47:19.836 --> 47:22.213
I really wanted to, but...

47:22.798 --> 47:24.465
I just didn't know what.

47:26.218 --> 47:28.135
You seemed kinda different.

47:32.098 --> 47:33.390
Yeah.

47:34.643 --> 47:36.352
I was different.

47:37.354 --> 47:38.938
I am different.

47:46.780 --> 47:48.030
C'mon!

47:57.999 --> 47:59.708
Come on, I'll race ya.

48:01.044 --> 48:04.171
I don't think I'm ready
for a race right now.

48:28.613 --> 48:30.531
One sec, one sec.

48:31.950 --> 48:33.951
It's probably my parents.

48:33.952 --> 48:35.703
Yeah, it's my mom.

48:35.704 --> 48:41.959
"With Franky, catching up on old times".

49:00.186 --> 49:01.729
Oh, shit,

49:03.106 --> 49:04.732
that was so sudden.

49:04.941 --> 49:06.108
It's fine.

49:06.109 --> 49:07.610
It's okay.

49:07.611 --> 49:08.903
That's so embarrassing.

49:12.407 --> 49:14.491
It is yours.

49:17.454 --> 49:19.496
Alright. I should get going.

49:19.497 --> 49:21.649
You know my mom
always worries when I'm out late.

49:21.650 --> 49:23.250
Right.

49:23.251 --> 49:25.127
- So you know...
- Yeah.

49:38.475 --> 49:39.934
Wait up.

49:48.276 --> 49:50.027
<i>Right to the wall.</i>

49:51.404 --> 49:52.821
<i>Reach!</i>

50:11.466 --> 50:12.675
Hey.

50:13.240 --> 50:14.574
Hi.

50:15.178 --> 50:17.012
Can I walk to school with you?

50:18.431 --> 50:19.932
If you want.

50:19.933 --> 50:21.016
You...

50:21.017 --> 50:25.896
You do realize that together
we make one giant target, right?

50:26.815 --> 50:28.732
I don't care if you don't.

50:28.733 --> 50:32.194
I mean, it can't get much worse,
I suppose.

50:32.195 --> 50:33.946
That's the spirit.

50:35.615 --> 50:39.201
Yeah, I'm not ever
gonna do that fist bump...

50:39.202 --> 50:40.369
Yeah, right.

50:40.370 --> 50:41.912
Just so you know.

50:58.785 --> 51:01.371
I guess I'll see ya later,
huh, faggot?

51:02.434 --> 51:04.226
See ya later, ho.

51:17.073 --> 51:19.491
Hey, what ya think
you're doing with Natasha?

51:19.492 --> 51:20.784
What's it to you?

51:20.785 --> 51:22.286
I don't like my sister being used.

51:22.287 --> 51:23.620
Don't bother
with that big brother bullshit.

51:23.621 --> 51:26.749
Look, don't bother using her just so
people think you're into girls, alright?

51:26.750 --> 51:29.626
Actually,
Natasha and I used to hang out.

51:29.627 --> 51:31.295
Yeah, right.

51:31.296 --> 51:32.713
Yeah.

51:32.714 --> 51:34.590
We got pretty close.

51:54.778 --> 51:56.612
Are you not getting this?

51:57.447 --> 51:58.697
Seriously, man,

51:58.698 --> 52:01.492
- you need to report this.
- Ya mind leaving me alone?

52:01.493 --> 52:03.827
You're not making this any easier.

52:17.050 --> 52:19.093
Hey. Where're ya going?

52:19.094 --> 52:21.345
Just bike ride. Won't be long.

52:24.974 --> 52:26.600
Where do you think she's going?

52:26.601 --> 52:28.018
I don't know.

52:30.396 --> 52:32.272
Ballas, you have any idea?

52:32.712 --> 52:34.131
No.

52:39.030 --> 52:40.823
She's probably meeting Franky.

52:40.824 --> 52:42.032
Franky?

52:42.033 --> 52:44.284
Since when does Nat
hang out with Franky?

52:44.702 --> 52:47.663
I think they've spent
some time together now and then.

52:47.664 --> 52:48.747
She say that?

52:48.748 --> 52:50.124
Mhm.

52:52.836 --> 52:54.461
Is that true, Bal?

52:55.255 --> 52:56.964
Yeah, I guess so.

53:13.314 --> 53:15.858
I think this is it.

53:17.777 --> 53:21.029
I swear it seemed bigger before.

53:21.030 --> 53:23.407
Probably 'cause you were high.

53:23.408 --> 53:24.783
Yeah.

53:33.543 --> 53:34.877
Franky...

53:37.005 --> 53:40.340
Why didn't you meet me that night,

53:40.341 --> 53:42.259
at that party, like we planned?

53:47.265 --> 53:49.391
I didn't want to hurt Ballas.

53:51.603 --> 53:53.145
I thought he'd feel...

53:53.146 --> 53:54.688
abandoned.

53:58.318 --> 53:59.985
What happened that night?

54:04.407 --> 54:06.533
I woke up...

54:07.118 --> 54:08.660
naked...

54:09.329 --> 54:11.955
in a closet.

54:12.749 --> 54:14.374
I guess they...

54:14.375 --> 54:16.960
had dumped me in there and then...

54:16.961 --> 54:19.338
threw my clothes on top of me.

54:21.341 --> 54:25.469
The last thing I remember
was waiting to use the bathroom.

54:25.470 --> 54:28.388
And it still is.

54:32.894 --> 54:36.813
Ya know, you'd think it'd be better...

54:37.607 --> 54:40.859
not remembering anything, but...

54:42.445 --> 54:44.863
in a weird way it's just...

54:46.074 --> 54:47.574
it's worse.

54:50.578 --> 54:52.412
I'm sorry I wasn't there for you.

54:52.413 --> 54:53.997
Franky, don't...

54:53.998 --> 54:56.083
don't cry.

55:00.588 --> 55:02.255
Can I kiss you?

55:08.137 --> 55:09.513
Franky,

55:11.307 --> 55:15.519
would you still
want to hang with me if I said...

55:15.520 --> 55:18.522
I might not ever want to have sex...

55:18.523 --> 55:21.775
even touch like we did the other night?

55:23.778 --> 55:25.988
It's okay if you don't want that.

55:26.406 --> 55:27.864
I dunno,

55:27.865 --> 55:29.199
I might.

55:29.200 --> 55:33.662
Just what if it wasn't
for a while or a long time?

55:33.663 --> 55:34.997
Then we wouldn't...

55:35.790 --> 55:37.666
for a long time.

55:37.667 --> 55:39.459
You'd really be okay with that?

55:39.460 --> 55:42.086
Well, what are you talking about...
like twenty years?

55:42.087 --> 55:43.130
No.

55:43.131 --> 55:46.508
Five... Four... three?

55:46.509 --> 55:48.260
I don't know, you know?

55:48.261 --> 55:49.970
Maybe...

55:50.471 --> 55:54.099
months or weeks. You know, I dunno...

55:54.100 --> 55:56.184
I dunno, just...

55:56.769 --> 55:58.437
when it feels right.

56:00.398 --> 56:02.399
I'm good with that.

56:06.696 --> 56:08.864
You still wanna kiss me?

56:08.865 --> 56:10.240
Yeah.

56:17.915 --> 56:19.374
Race you.

56:24.547 --> 56:26.381
Hey, you can't run with it!

56:26.382 --> 56:27.716
Watch me!

56:56.954 --> 56:58.080
Hey.

56:58.081 --> 56:59.664
I want my bike back, bitch.

56:59.665 --> 57:01.541
I don't know what you're talking about.

57:01.542 --> 57:03.502
I know it was you.

57:06.798 --> 57:08.173
Carly, Franky,

57:08.174 --> 57:11.510
thank you for taking the time
to meet with Ballas and I.

57:11.511 --> 57:14.596
We felt we could probably
resolve this whole mix-up

57:14.597 --> 57:16.473
pretty quick,
if we just spoke face to face.

57:16.474 --> 57:18.391
Listen, you guys...

57:18.392 --> 57:20.852
have been best friends
for a really long time

57:20.853 --> 57:22.562
not to be able to resolve this.

57:22.563 --> 57:25.607
I mean, honestly, I don't even
believe what's happening here.

57:26.150 --> 57:28.527
Franky, Ballas has something for you.

57:36.494 --> 57:39.621
That's $125 of his own money,

57:39.622 --> 57:41.164
as payment for damages to your bike.

57:41.165 --> 57:44.334
It was completely unacceptable
what he did, and he's sorry.

57:46.379 --> 57:47.712
Sorry.

57:50.967 --> 57:53.593
Well, thank you, Ballas.

57:53.594 --> 57:55.637
That is really very good of you.

57:56.305 --> 57:58.431
Do you have something to say, Franky?

58:00.143 --> 58:01.518
Thanks.

58:03.354 --> 58:06.022
And about Ballas' bike...

58:06.607 --> 58:08.108
I don't know where it is.

58:08.109 --> 58:09.734
- He's lying.
- Okay, you two.

58:09.735 --> 58:13.613
We all know things have occurred
that none of us saw coming...

58:13.614 --> 58:16.575
and clearly it's created
a lot of tension between you two.

58:17.285 --> 58:19.119
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

58:19.120 --> 58:23.915
But that's no reason
for all this enmity. Is it, Carly?

58:23.916 --> 58:26.084
Absolutely not.

58:26.460 --> 58:28.545
Things change, right?

58:28.546 --> 58:31.381
Sometimes,
even close friendships can change.

58:31.382 --> 58:33.675
- That's life.
- Just give me a sec.

58:34.719 --> 58:36.094
Now, Franky,

58:36.095 --> 58:38.722
- Ballas has paid for the damages...
- I'll be right back.

58:38.723 --> 58:40.015
Okay.

58:43.895 --> 58:45.729
<i>I specifically told you...</i>

58:49.192 --> 58:50.859
Your dad's here.

58:51.569 --> 58:52.903
Ray!

58:52.904 --> 58:54.863
- Good to see you.
- Nic.

58:54.864 --> 58:56.573
Great that you can make it here.

58:56.574 --> 58:57.824
As you can imagine,

58:57.825 --> 58:59.743
I very much wanted to be
part of this conversation.

58:59.744 --> 59:00.952
Naturely, naturely.

59:00.953 --> 59:04.414
It's a shame the circumstances
aren't better, but here we are.

59:08.502 --> 59:09.920
Franky.

59:10.546 --> 59:11.963
Ballas.

59:13.549 --> 59:15.300
So, where are we?

59:15.301 --> 59:18.261
I was just stressing to the guys that...

59:18.262 --> 59:22.182
despite the tensions
that have arisen lately,

59:22.183 --> 59:26.228
there's no reason we can't
resolve these things amicably.

59:27.813 --> 59:29.522
I mean, they both know by now...

59:29.523 --> 59:33.193
that life is not always
as we expect it to be.

59:34.403 --> 59:37.197
Sometimes there's
unforeseen situations...

59:37.198 --> 59:38.615
That's life.

59:40.910 --> 59:43.495
Though perhaps not
the most critical issue now.

59:43.496 --> 59:46.164
Listen, the point is Ballas
took responsibility.

59:46.165 --> 59:49.251
He's paying for the damage
to Franky's bike. He apologized.

59:49.252 --> 59:51.836
So, you admit to vandalizing
Franky's bike?

59:53.005 --> 59:54.422
- I was there.
- Yeah.

59:54.423 --> 59:57.550
I assume by offering your own money,
you feel somewhat responsible.

59:57.551 --> 01:00:00.136
- I think we're past that, Ray.
- Nah, I'm just curious.

01:00:00.721 --> 01:00:03.014
Did Ballas say why he did it?

01:00:03.015 --> 01:00:04.474
Look,

01:00:04.475 --> 01:00:06.142
I know it wasn't right,

01:00:06.143 --> 01:00:08.353
which is why I'm paying for it.

01:00:08.354 --> 01:00:09.271
Ray,

01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:11.022
the only thing I see missing here,

01:00:11.023 --> 01:00:13.566
is a willingness on Franky's part
to meet Ballas halfway.

01:00:13.567 --> 01:00:15.068
I have no idea where it is.

01:00:15.069 --> 01:00:15.902
Bullshit.

01:00:15.903 --> 01:00:17.779
Franky, if you know
where Ballas' bike is...

01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:19.072
It's not about the bike.

01:00:19.073 --> 01:00:20.991
Don't complicate this
anymore than it has to be.

01:00:20.992 --> 01:00:23.118
When he comes home from swim team
with a bloody nose!

01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:24.286
Ray, as far as I know,

01:00:24.287 --> 01:00:27.163
Ballas had nothing to do
with Franky's bloody nose.

01:00:27.687 --> 01:00:28.813
No.

01:00:29.166 --> 01:00:30.917
I didn't touch him.

01:00:33.921 --> 01:00:36.031
He's not going to return the bike.
Let's just go.

01:00:36.032 --> 01:00:36.673
Ballas.

01:00:36.674 --> 01:00:39.134
Hey, Ballas, come on, hang on.

01:00:41.929 --> 01:00:43.388
Franky.

01:00:48.269 --> 01:00:51.187
Listen, I know you've been
spending time with Natasha lately,

01:00:51.188 --> 01:00:52.939
and I don't know what that's all about,

01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:55.066
or what your intentions are, but...

01:00:56.193 --> 01:00:59.487
it's important you understand
that she's been through a lot.

01:01:03.284 --> 01:01:04.701
I know.

01:01:05.745 --> 01:01:07.787
Franky, It's very important to me
that she be treated

01:01:07.788 --> 01:01:10.373
with utmost care.

01:01:12.501 --> 01:01:13.877
Me too.

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:17.255
Okay.

01:01:20.926 --> 01:01:22.828
Hey, thanks so much, Nic.
Appreciate it.

01:01:22.829 --> 01:01:23.595
Yeah.

01:01:23.596 --> 01:01:26.014
- Night, Ray.
- Night.

01:01:29.143 --> 01:01:30.477
Hey, dad.

01:01:31.187 --> 01:01:33.229
Hey, sweetheart.

01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:34.981
You should go now.

01:01:38.652 --> 01:01:41.321
Deanne, would you let Franky know
I'd like to speak to him?

01:01:41.322 --> 01:01:42.572
I'll be in my car.

01:01:42.573 --> 01:01:44.074
- Okay.
- Thank you.

01:01:44.075 --> 01:01:45.992
- Night.
- Night.

01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:49.329
- Goodnight Carly.
- Goodnight.

01:01:52.208 --> 01:01:54.876
Listen, I gotta be in Berlin for work

01:01:54.877 --> 01:01:56.336
for about a week.

01:01:57.046 --> 01:01:58.713
You should come along.

01:01:58.714 --> 01:02:01.091
I'm just really not in the mood
for travelling right now.

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:06.012
I don't like leaving you behind
with what's been happening.

01:02:06.430 --> 01:02:09.766
- I'll postpone.
- You don't have to, I'm fine.

01:02:14.355 --> 01:02:16.731
Nobody asked you to be there tonight.

01:02:21.737 --> 01:02:23.947
I didn't think the absence
of an invitation...

01:02:23.948 --> 01:02:26.282
was a good enough reason
to not be there.

01:02:28.869 --> 01:02:30.286
Especially considering

01:02:30.287 --> 01:02:32.872
some of the smart moves
I see the adults making.

01:02:32.873 --> 01:02:34.833
What was your swim coach thinking?

01:02:34.834 --> 01:02:36.709
Segregating the changing room?

01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:38.294
- That's what Michael wanted.
- Yeah?

01:02:38.295 --> 01:02:41.464
Michael should never have been put
in that position, in the first place.

01:02:48.097 --> 01:02:49.347
I'm curious,

01:02:49.348 --> 01:02:51.808
How many of you chose
to change with Michael?

01:02:54.061 --> 01:02:55.728
I didn't count.

01:03:05.739 --> 01:03:07.449
I have homework.

01:03:22.214 --> 01:03:24.007
So what are you two up to tonight?

01:03:26.677 --> 01:03:29.721
We went to Franky's, we're
gonna play scrabble with Carly.

01:03:29.722 --> 01:03:31.181
That sounds fun.

01:03:31.182 --> 01:03:32.974
We should do that sometime.

01:03:49.950 --> 01:03:52.118
Do you really think he's into you?

01:03:56.207 --> 01:04:00.376
You know, I think he's just
using you to prove he's straight,

01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:04.464
and you're the only one
stupid enough to fuck him.

01:04:13.891 --> 01:04:16.559
I don't fuck him, Ballas.

01:04:17.144 --> 01:04:19.354
Just give him the occasional blow job.

01:04:19.355 --> 01:04:20.480
Which...

01:04:20.481 --> 01:04:23.107
I guess we have in common, don't we?

01:04:23.108 --> 01:04:24.484
Big bro.

01:04:24.485 --> 01:04:26.528
Get out of my room!

01:04:27.321 --> 01:04:29.531
<i>What the hell's going on up there?</i>

01:04:33.035 --> 01:04:34.536
Nothing.

01:04:36.330 --> 01:04:38.915
<i>I was just talking to her,
and she freaked out.</i>

01:04:55.015 --> 01:04:56.766
Hey, Franky.

01:04:58.185 --> 01:05:00.103
What are you doing, man?

01:05:00.104 --> 01:05:02.438
I thought you were hanging
with my sister tonight.

01:05:02.439 --> 01:05:04.607
Where is she? She is inside?

01:05:05.109 --> 01:05:06.359
My place.

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:07.986
That's right!

01:05:08.279 --> 01:05:11.155
She's playing scrabble
with Franky and his mom.

01:05:11.865 --> 01:05:13.575
That's so nice.

01:05:14.243 --> 01:05:16.202
Hey, where's your dad?

01:05:16.203 --> 01:05:19.622
Is he too busy getting fucked
by his boyfriend to play scrabble?

01:05:19.623 --> 01:05:21.583
Hey, what do you got there?

01:05:21.584 --> 01:05:23.126
Hey.

01:05:23.127 --> 01:05:25.253
I wanna see what you got.

01:05:28.674 --> 01:05:30.258
It's pretty good. Let me try.

01:05:30.259 --> 01:05:31.801
Want some?

01:05:31.802 --> 01:05:33.553
- Want a little bite?
- Come on, pass it.

01:05:33.554 --> 01:05:35.930
No? Here, it's fucking good.

01:05:37.308 --> 01:05:40.184
You and that little slut
are fucking pathetic.

01:05:40.185 --> 01:05:42.186
It's you that's fucking pathetic.

01:05:42.187 --> 01:05:43.855
Where the fuck is my bike?

01:05:43.856 --> 01:05:45.315
Huh?

01:05:45.649 --> 01:05:47.025
Fuck it!

01:05:47.026 --> 01:05:49.360
Insurance company's gonna buy me
a new fucking bike.

01:05:49.361 --> 01:05:52.322
It's not gonna look like this
old fucking piece of shit.

01:05:52.698 --> 01:05:53.948
What do you got here?

01:05:53.949 --> 01:05:56.367
Root beer. My favourite.

01:05:56.368 --> 01:05:58.244
It's my favourite, Franky.

01:05:58.245 --> 01:06:00.997
You know what? It looks better on you.

01:06:00.998 --> 01:06:02.540
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:06:02.541 --> 01:06:05.543
What the fuck are you so afraid of?

01:06:06.295 --> 01:06:08.463
Shut your fucking mouth.

01:06:08.464 --> 01:06:10.965
Ballas. What are you doing?

01:06:10.966 --> 01:06:12.467
Faggot!

01:06:12.468 --> 01:06:13.843
Yeah.

01:06:25.814 --> 01:06:27.065
Hey, stop.

01:06:29.401 --> 01:06:30.526
Stop!

01:06:30.527 --> 01:06:32.403
Hey, he's had enough.

01:06:37.618 --> 01:06:39.744
Ballas, hey!

01:06:39.745 --> 01:06:41.287
Jesus Christ, Dude, get off of him!

01:06:43.207 --> 01:06:44.582
Fuck you!

01:06:44.583 --> 01:06:46.501
You fucking asshole!

01:07:36.135 --> 01:07:37.677
<i>Oh, Franky,</i>

01:07:37.678 --> 01:07:39.846
<i>I'm so sorry this happened to you.</i>

01:07:41.765 --> 01:07:44.475
<i>I'm gonna change my flight
and come home.</i>

01:07:44.476 --> 01:07:46.144
No, you don't have to, I'm fine.

01:07:46.145 --> 01:07:47.687
I'll see you when you get back.

01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:54.068
I should go, I need to get cleaned up.

01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:58.531
<i>Okay, tell your mom
I'm gonna call her back, okay?</i>

01:07:58.532 --> 01:07:59.949
Sure.

01:08:00.659 --> 01:08:02.243
<i>I love you, son.</i>

01:08:02.953 --> 01:08:04.245
Bye.

01:08:47.937 --> 01:08:50.814
"Tash: Please, call me. Can I
come over? Hey, are you ok?"

01:10:01.530 --> 01:10:03.322
Oh, buddy...

01:10:05.159 --> 01:10:06.659
What did you...

01:10:07.619 --> 01:10:09.162
I'm okay.

01:10:17.671 --> 01:10:19.630
You actually look good.

01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:42.695
Oh my God. What the hell?

01:10:43.322 --> 01:10:45.031
Fucking Ballas, man.

01:10:45.032 --> 01:10:46.365
Motherfucker!

01:10:46.408 --> 01:10:48.201
What're you doing here?

01:10:48.202 --> 01:10:51.746
I just cut class
to see how you're doing.

01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:57.501
Fuck 'em, right?

01:10:58.462 --> 01:11:00.338
That's right.

01:11:00.339 --> 01:11:02.173
Wanna watch TV?

01:11:11.642 --> 01:11:13.309
New sock-cock?

01:11:13.894 --> 01:11:16.604
No, actually, it's a strap-on.

01:11:16.605 --> 01:11:19.065
I bought it online
with my mom's credit card.

01:11:21.944 --> 01:11:23.861
Do you think it's too much?

01:11:24.446 --> 01:11:26.030
It's pretty big.

01:11:26.031 --> 01:11:27.823
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:11:27.824 --> 01:11:29.659
It's pretty big.

01:11:30.535 --> 01:11:32.203
Hey, Franky?

01:11:32.685 --> 01:11:34.186
Um...

01:11:36.083 --> 01:11:38.292
I need you to tell me if it feels real.

01:11:38.293 --> 01:11:39.502
Mm, no.

01:11:39.503 --> 01:11:41.462
No, I'm not gonna touch that.

01:11:41.463 --> 01:11:43.130
Dude, come on,
how else am I gonna know?

01:11:43.131 --> 01:11:45.591
Just this once, okay?
For a pal. Please?

01:11:45.592 --> 01:11:46.968
Please.

01:11:47.970 --> 01:11:49.345
Come on.

01:11:49.346 --> 01:11:50.846
- Come on.
- Okay,

01:11:50.847 --> 01:11:52.515
I'm doing it, okay?

01:12:00.399 --> 01:12:01.857
Well?

01:12:02.651 --> 01:12:04.527
I don't know. Sort of.

01:12:04.861 --> 01:12:09.615
It's when it's between erect and soft.

01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:19.208
There's like not very many people
I could ask to do that.

01:12:21.044 --> 01:12:23.587
Like actually none,
when it gets down to it.

01:12:23.588 --> 01:12:25.256
Okay, whatever.

01:12:25.257 --> 01:12:26.799
You're welcome.

01:12:29.511 --> 01:12:31.304
Hey, Franky?

01:12:31.305 --> 01:12:32.680
Yeah?

01:12:33.807 --> 01:12:35.891
Can I see yours?

01:12:36.268 --> 01:12:38.019
- No, no.
- Why not?

01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:39.812
'Cause that's weird.

01:12:39.813 --> 01:12:42.064
That's not weird.
How is that weird, dude?

01:12:42.065 --> 01:12:43.316
Really weird.

01:12:50.032 --> 01:12:51.532
What?

01:12:51.533 --> 01:12:54.103
It's just like smaller than I was expecting.

01:12:54.104 --> 01:12:54.744
Okay.

01:12:54.745 --> 01:12:56.981
I don't mean... I'm not saying
it is small. I'm just saying...

01:12:56.982 --> 01:12:57.621
It's not.

01:12:57.622 --> 01:12:58.956
It changes sizes.

01:12:58.957 --> 01:13:01.083
Depends on the temperature and stuff.

01:13:01.084 --> 01:13:02.543
And it's cold in here, so...

01:13:02.544 --> 01:13:04.086
You see, I would not have known that,

01:13:04.087 --> 01:13:05.546
I would not have known that,

01:13:05.547 --> 01:13:07.048
and this is very educational for me.

01:13:07.049 --> 01:13:08.591
That's awesome.

01:13:08.592 --> 01:13:10.176
Besides, you wanna know something?

01:13:10.177 --> 01:13:11.635
Priscilla,

01:13:11.636 --> 01:13:15.014
about a month ago, she told the girls
that she thought it was big.

01:13:16.933 --> 01:13:19.477
- Really?
- Yeah, dude.

01:13:19.811 --> 01:13:23.397
Why else do you think all these bitches
are so upset that you might be gay?

01:13:23.398 --> 01:13:24.982
- I'm not.
- Okay, whatever.

01:13:24.983 --> 01:13:26.692
Anyway, Franky,
I need to touch your thing.

01:13:26.693 --> 01:13:28.277
- No.
- Why not?

01:13:28.278 --> 01:13:29.653
- You promised me!
- When?

01:13:29.654 --> 01:13:32.198
I'm not asking you to cut it off
and give it to me!

01:13:32.199 --> 01:13:34.742
- Don't even joke about that...
- I'm sorry.

01:13:34.743 --> 01:13:37.203
How else am I gonna know
what a real one feels like?

01:13:37.204 --> 01:13:39.330
I just need to know
for my peace of mind. Okay?

01:13:39.331 --> 01:13:40.831
Please, please, come on!

01:13:40.832 --> 01:13:42.416
Come on, man.

01:13:42.417 --> 01:13:44.168
Come on, please.

01:13:45.045 --> 01:13:46.712
God.

01:13:46.713 --> 01:13:49.131
Oh my God. Okay.

01:13:51.343 --> 01:13:53.052
Okay.

01:13:54.012 --> 01:13:56.472
Hurry up! You're not
cracking a fucking safe!

01:13:56.473 --> 01:13:58.349
Right, yeah, okay, um...

01:14:03.313 --> 01:14:04.381
Is it getting bigger?

01:14:04.382 --> 01:14:06.440
- No, it's not getting bigger!
- Why is it getting bigger?

01:14:06.441 --> 01:14:08.734
- 'Cause you touched it!
- Yeah, but it's me, it's Mouse.

01:14:08.735 --> 01:14:11.195
Well, it doesn't know who it is, so...

01:14:14.074 --> 01:14:16.158
- Well, how big does it get?
- Oh my God.

01:14:16.159 --> 01:14:18.702
- Show me! Come on!
- No! No.

01:14:18.703 --> 01:14:21.789
What?
Is it like more than eight inches?

01:14:25.210 --> 01:14:27.628
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:14:29.548 --> 01:14:31.298
Sup, Deanne?

01:14:31.299 --> 01:14:33.050
Nothin' much.

01:14:54.489 --> 01:14:56.282
Oh, God, Franky.

01:14:56.283 --> 01:14:58.868
The bus was a little quicker
than I thought.

01:14:58.869 --> 01:15:00.744
- Am I too early?
- No.

01:15:00.745 --> 01:15:02.163
Come on in.

01:15:04.207 --> 01:15:06.792
Yeah, just down here.

01:15:15.218 --> 01:15:17.052
This is it.

01:15:18.138 --> 01:15:19.930
It's a great view.

01:15:20.348 --> 01:15:22.057
Yeah,

01:15:22.058 --> 01:15:24.393
it was definitely a selling point.

01:15:30.567 --> 01:15:32.109
Does it hurt?

01:15:32.611 --> 01:15:34.111
A little.

01:15:37.949 --> 01:15:41.202
I suggested we remove
some cushions, but...

01:15:41.578 --> 01:15:43.329
he didn't go for it.

01:15:45.165 --> 01:15:47.541
It looks pretty comfortable, actually.

01:15:48.543 --> 01:15:49.835
Yeah.

01:15:51.129 --> 01:15:53.422
I'm making pasta.

01:15:53.423 --> 01:15:56.300
Figured that would be easier
for you to chew.

01:15:56.301 --> 01:15:57.468
Yeah?

01:15:57.469 --> 01:15:59.720
Got your favourite sauce here.

01:15:59.721 --> 01:16:01.096
Awesome.

01:16:07.395 --> 01:16:08.938
Brendan had to work tonight,

01:16:08.939 --> 01:16:10.356
so he won't be able to join us,

01:16:10.357 --> 01:16:12.316
but he wanted me to say hi.

01:16:14.277 --> 01:16:15.611
You want something to drink?

01:16:15.612 --> 01:16:16.862
I've got, um...

01:16:16.863 --> 01:16:19.907
OJ, soft drinks, apple juice.

01:16:19.908 --> 01:16:21.492
Some wine?

01:16:23.161 --> 01:16:24.703
Why not?

01:16:27.082 --> 01:16:28.374
I guess you're old enough...

01:16:28.375 --> 01:16:30.876
to join your old man
for a glass of wine, right?

01:16:44.057 --> 01:16:46.100
Oh, hey, I've got something for you.

01:16:47.561 --> 01:16:49.228
Come. Follow me.

01:16:59.155 --> 01:17:00.948
I got you this.

01:17:02.951 --> 01:17:04.577
Just try it on.

01:17:13.086 --> 01:17:14.420
Yeah.

01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:22.052
I mean, we could get it altered,
but how does it feel?

01:17:22.053 --> 01:17:24.471
- Feels good.
- Yeah?

01:17:24.472 --> 01:17:26.223
Check it out in the mirror.

01:17:30.270 --> 01:17:31.645
Alright?

01:17:31.646 --> 01:17:33.272
- You like it?
- Yeah,

01:17:33.273 --> 01:17:34.398
it's cool.

01:17:34.399 --> 01:17:37.818
Style is so personal, you know,
but I had a hunch,

01:17:38.653 --> 01:17:40.779
and I'm glad I got it for you.

01:17:40.780 --> 01:17:42.114
You really like it?

01:17:42.115 --> 01:17:44.617
Yeah, I like it.

01:17:46.786 --> 01:17:48.912
You look sophisticated.

01:17:49.956 --> 01:17:51.582
Thanks.

01:17:58.673 --> 01:18:00.591
So how'd you meet Brendan?

01:18:05.472 --> 01:18:06.764
Well...

01:18:09.768 --> 01:18:11.268
Brendan works for a company

01:18:11.269 --> 01:18:13.395
that my company partners with sometimes.

01:18:17.673 --> 01:18:19.091
He...

01:18:19.527 --> 01:18:22.655
He asked me out to coffee one time,
after a meeting...

01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:27.034
I said, um...
"do you wanna talk about work?"

01:18:27.035 --> 01:18:28.327
And he said...

01:18:28.328 --> 01:18:31.288
"actually no,
it was more of a personal matter",

01:18:31.289 --> 01:18:34.750
and I realized
the way he was looking at me...

01:18:34.751 --> 01:18:36.794
he was actually interested in me.

01:18:37.837 --> 01:18:39.588
So I said no,

01:18:39.589 --> 01:18:41.173
I have a wife,

01:18:42.133 --> 01:18:44.093
and he never mentioned it again.

01:18:47.138 --> 01:18:49.390
But, I couldn't stop thinking about it.

01:18:53.436 --> 01:18:55.729
Every time I saw him after that,

01:18:55.730 --> 01:18:59.775
it was like being hit by a giant wave,
and swept out to sea.

01:19:04.886 --> 01:19:06.263
So...

01:19:09.077 --> 01:19:11.245
that went on for a few months,

01:19:11.913 --> 01:19:14.206
and then I asked him out for coffee.

01:19:15.166 --> 01:19:17.042
He said yes, and...

01:19:17.585 --> 01:19:18.961
that was it.

01:19:18.962 --> 01:19:21.088
I told your mother that evening.

01:19:26.594 --> 01:19:29.471
How could you not know all those years?

01:19:30.014 --> 01:19:32.558
Well, I fell in love with your mother.

01:19:32.559 --> 01:19:36.061
We wanted to have a family,
just like everyone else we knew.

01:19:36.062 --> 01:19:37.980
I still love your mom.

01:19:38.314 --> 01:19:40.190
Just different now.

01:19:42.944 --> 01:19:45.738
The thing that happened
with me and Ballas...

01:19:47.991 --> 01:19:50.534
It felt normal at the time.

01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:54.580
It was only afterward that things got...

01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:57.750
We got scared.

01:20:02.005 --> 01:20:04.256
If it's possible
you didn't know all those years,

01:20:04.257 --> 01:20:06.091
then maybe I don't either.

01:20:07.886 --> 01:20:10.637
I suggest you just pay attention
to who you're drawn to,

01:20:10.638 --> 01:20:13.849
and not worry too much
about what to call it at this point.

01:20:13.850 --> 01:20:15.434
You know?

01:20:16.853 --> 01:20:19.480
I don't want to make
the same mistake you did.

01:20:21.691 --> 01:20:24.318
I don't think of it
as a mistake, Franky.

01:20:25.403 --> 01:20:27.613
Not marrying your mother.

01:20:27.614 --> 01:20:30.449
You and Deanne. Brendan.

01:20:30.825 --> 01:20:32.493
None of it.

01:20:35.705 --> 01:20:40.250
It sounds like you had a sexual experience
with somebody you really loved.

01:20:40.919 --> 01:20:42.753
Could be that simple.

01:20:47.342 --> 01:20:49.259
You're a good person,

01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:50.719
Franky.

01:20:54.057 --> 01:20:55.891
You're a fine young man.

01:20:55.892 --> 01:20:58.519
I'm really proud to be your dad.

01:21:05.276 --> 01:21:06.693
Come on.

01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:09.154
Come on, let's go eat.

01:21:38.434 --> 01:21:40.060
What do you want?

01:21:40.854 --> 01:21:42.271
Nothing.

01:21:42.856 --> 01:21:44.439
You?

01:21:47.443 --> 01:21:48.986
Nothing.

01:21:51.531 --> 01:21:52.739
Okay.

01:22:35.617 --> 01:22:37.409
Look at you.

01:22:38.828 --> 01:22:41.580
You look actually kinda badass now.

01:22:41.581 --> 01:22:42.748
Badass?

01:22:42.749 --> 01:22:45.667
Yeah, I think all the girls
are gonna be hot for you again.

01:23:02.226 --> 01:23:04.186
You wanna walk me to class?

01:23:04.187 --> 01:23:05.687
Okay.

01:23:56.239 --> 01:23:57.364
Got it?

01:23:58.199 --> 01:23:59.574
Franky!

01:24:00.535 --> 01:24:01.994
Welcome back.

01:24:06.666 --> 01:24:08.625
Grab a board, jump in.

01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:09.918
Go!

01:24:23.391 --> 01:24:24.850
Alright.

01:24:26.019 --> 01:24:27.894
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:24:31.399 --> 01:24:33.483
And... the seat.

01:24:36.154 --> 01:24:37.404
Is that dad out there?

01:24:37.405 --> 01:24:38.488
Yeah.

01:24:38.489 --> 01:24:40.615
- Dad, hi!
- Hey!

01:24:40.616 --> 01:24:41.867
Oh my god,

01:24:41.868 --> 01:24:44.369
did douche bag have Ballas' bike
the whole time?

01:24:44.370 --> 01:24:46.329
I knew he had it hidden somewhere.

01:24:52.086 --> 01:24:53.462
Okay...

01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:56.256
<i>Franky...</i>

01:24:56.507 --> 01:24:57.924
<i>What have you done?</i>

01:25:46.121 --> 01:25:48.581
LOVE YOU FOREVER

01:28:26.030 --> 01:28:29.075
GIANT LITTLE ONES
