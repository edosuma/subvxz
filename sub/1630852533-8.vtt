00:01.201 --> 00:02.534
<i> [Amy Bruni] It's the</i>
<i>  paranormal activity</i>
<i>  in the home</i>

00:02.603 --> 00:05.504
<i>  has gotten to a point</i>
<i>  that they barely want to</i>
<i>  live with it.</i>

00:05.572 --> 00:08.640
I just heard like
a full-on voice
in the corner over here.

00:08.676 --> 00:10.542
[muted groan]

00:10.778 --> 00:13.112
-[Amy] What?
-What in the hell was that?

00:13.180 --> 00:14.546
Night time is hard.

00:14.682 --> 00:16.315
[woman 1]
<i>  I felt somebody</i>
<i>  stand next to me.</i>

00:16.417 --> 00:19.952
Keep feeling like a cold
burst of air.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.520
It's over my hands.

00:21.822 --> 00:23.255
Something just touched
the back of my head.

00:25.026 --> 00:26.492
[door slams]

00:26.560 --> 00:28.327
<i> [Amy] The dead want a voice.</i>

00:28.395 --> 00:29.528
We just want to help
this family.

00:29.596 --> 00:31.163
[Adam Berry]
<i>  The living need our help.</i>

00:31.231 --> 00:32.131
Have you always been here?

00:32.166 --> 00:33.832
He was watching already.

00:47.648 --> 00:50.916
<i> [Amy] The woman</i>
<i>  who lives here, Missy,</i>
<i>  she has had extreme activity.</i>

00:50.984 --> 00:53.218
<i>  To the point where</i>
<i>  she wants to leave.</i>

00:53.253 --> 00:54.720
<i>  Like, she is unhappy</i>
<i>  in this home.</i>

00:54.788 --> 00:57.923
<i>  She says she feels like</i>
<i>  there's a malevolent energy</i>
<i>  in the house.</i>

00:57.991 --> 00:59.992
<i>  -Something crawls into bed</i>
<i>  with her at night.</i>
<i> -[Adam] Oh,</i>

01:00.060 --> 01:02.127
<i>  -that's not okay.</i>
<i> -[Amy] No!</i>

01:02.196 --> 01:04.129
And it's not just her,
it's the entire family.

01:04.198 --> 01:05.998
And... really...

01:06.066 --> 01:09.168
It seems as
if we're their only hope.

01:09.236 --> 01:11.403
-[Amy] Let's head in
and meet Missy.
-[Adam] Yeah.

01:21.982 --> 01:24.750
[Amy] So tell us
what's going on. You sounded
really desperate.

01:24.818 --> 01:27.820
Yes, I am.
I would like my house back.

01:27.888 --> 01:30.089
We've been here
about 15-16 years.

01:30.124 --> 01:32.724
We've had activity
since we moved in,

01:32.760 --> 01:34.660
and the way that it's going,
I'm so nervous.

01:34.728 --> 01:36.895
Stuff happens to anybody
who comes here.

01:36.964 --> 01:39.465
I have friends
and family members
that won't come here.

01:39.533 --> 01:41.700
[Amy] Oh, really?
That's got to be tough.

01:41.768 --> 01:43.735
[Missy] One of my brothers
says, "Even for
a million dollars,

01:43.804 --> 01:45.537
-I wouldn't sleep over
at your house."
-[Adam] Really?

01:45.639 --> 01:46.705
I mean how does that
make you feel?

01:46.773 --> 01:49.541
Horrible. And since
we have started

01:49.743 --> 01:53.545
doing all the renovations,
the activity has just gone
through the roof.

01:53.614 --> 01:55.380
It's constant, it's every day.

01:56.650 --> 01:58.951
How long have you been
doing the renovations?

01:59.019 --> 02:01.854
In the last six months
I've put in central air,

02:01.922 --> 02:05.891
we put electric upstairs
and the more we do,

02:05.959 --> 02:07.626
the more it picks up.

02:07.694 --> 02:09.862
So, where is the majority
of the activity?

02:09.930 --> 02:13.832
My bedroom is the area
that's just... crazy.

02:13.868 --> 02:16.335
[Amy] Do you want to take us
into the bedroom

02:16.403 --> 02:18.570
-and show us what's going on
in there?
-[Missy] Absolutely.

02:21.775 --> 02:24.243
-[Amy] Your bedroom, you're
supposed to feel safe in here,
-[Messy] Yes.

02:24.278 --> 02:26.378
-[Amy] So, what's going on
in here?
-[Messy] And I don't.

02:26.413 --> 02:28.247
Night time is hard lately.

02:28.282 --> 02:29.448
Um...

02:31.552 --> 02:33.085
The, the most...

02:33.153 --> 02:36.488
physical activity I've ever
had in here was, I was laying
on my side.

02:36.557 --> 02:39.892
And it got really cold
and I felt the bed
go down.

02:39.960 --> 02:42.294
You could feel somebody
stand next to me.

02:43.130 --> 02:45.197
We'll be in bed and
you'll hear...

02:45.833 --> 02:47.366
the boots, the pacing...

02:48.903 --> 02:50.269
All the time.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.004
The other new thing is

02:52.039 --> 02:55.340
when I'm lying there
and the door is closed,

02:55.376 --> 02:58.510
it's like I sense somebody
standing in that corner
staring at me.

02:58.579 --> 02:59.778
[muted groan]

03:01.649 --> 03:04.816
And this is so bizarre
because I am a grown adult,
but...

03:04.852 --> 03:08.187
I won't go out in that hallway
at night.

03:08.255 --> 03:10.055
If I need a drink or have to
go to the bathroom,
I won't go out there.

03:10.123 --> 03:11.557
I will not go out there.

03:11.725 --> 03:14.526
I'll wait till morning because
I don't want to see,

03:14.595 --> 03:16.094
who is standing
in that hallway.

03:16.830 --> 03:17.863
Oh, jeez.

03:17.865 --> 03:20.032
[Missy] My boyfriend's
very much a sceptic.

03:20.067 --> 03:23.068
-[Amy] Mm-hm.
-Until he started staying here
over the last year

03:23.136 --> 03:25.537
-and he is
no longer a sceptic.
-[Adam] Really?

03:25.639 --> 03:27.706
-Okay.
-Yeah, because
he has woken me up.

03:27.774 --> 03:30.008
"Oh my gosh, you're right.
I can hear them."

03:30.077 --> 03:31.944
-'Cause you can hear
the walking in the attic.
-That's crazy.

03:32.012 --> 03:33.545
So, where else should we look?

03:33.714 --> 03:34.980
-[Missy] I should show you
the kitchen.
-[Adam] Yes.

03:35.015 --> 03:37.015
-[Adam] We'll go in here.
-Okay.

03:37.117 --> 03:40.152
You guys, I'm sorry,
the closet just opened
on its own.

03:44.091 --> 03:46.959
-It literally just opened up
on its own.
-[Amy] So it's a...

03:47.895 --> 03:49.361
Wait, hold on, even if
it's like...

03:50.064 --> 03:51.597
But it's...

03:51.665 --> 03:53.932
-Like it opened substantially.
-[Adam] Oh, yeah, it was here.

03:53.968 --> 03:56.802
-It makes no sense.
-[Missy] It does it
all the time.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.570
I always shut it,
it's always open.

03:58.639 --> 04:00.505
-[Amy] And it just opens
back up?
-[Missy] Yeah.

04:09.183 --> 04:11.083
So, one thing that does happen
in here is,

04:11.151 --> 04:13.919
you'll go to bed at night,
you'll go into the other room,

04:13.954 --> 04:14.920
and all the cupboards
will be closed.

04:14.988 --> 04:17.189
You come back
and the doors will be open.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.658
-[Amy] All of them?
-At times, all of them.

04:19.726 --> 04:20.826
-[Adam] Oh, God.
-[Amy] Okay.

04:20.894 --> 04:23.662
That's like poltergeist level
activity right there.

04:23.730 --> 04:26.898
[Adam] Yeah, I mean,
that's not...
That's not common.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.934
-So you haven't renovated?
-[Missy] No.

04:29.002 --> 04:34.206
I'm afraid, after what has
happened since we've...
started in the attic.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.675
I mean that's been,
caused such a change.

04:36.743 --> 04:39.211
-[Amy] Mm.
-And we haven't ripped
anything out of there.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.880
Like, this would be
ripping out all the
original cupboards.

04:41.948 --> 04:43.281
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

04:43.350 --> 04:47.719
It scares me to think
what would happen
with the activity then.

04:47.755 --> 04:49.554
-[Amy] Okay.
-Where should we go next?

04:49.757 --> 04:51.256
[Missy] I can
show you the basement.

05:01.669 --> 05:03.502
The basement's super creepy.

05:03.570 --> 05:07.172
-I don't like it down here.
-[Amy] You don't like it
down here, no?

05:07.207 --> 05:09.808
[Adam] What is it?
What are you feeling right now
while you're here?

05:09.876 --> 05:12.044
I just feel on edge down here.

05:14.014 --> 05:17.849
-[Amy] What's happening
down here?
-I have...

05:17.918 --> 05:21.787
been in this area and heard
someone say, "Missy"
right in my ear.

05:21.855 --> 05:23.188
-Mm-hm.
-Um...

05:23.256 --> 05:24.890
I have been touched down here,
and it,

05:24.958 --> 05:28.660
the one time it,
literally it just felt like
ice cubes.

05:28.729 --> 05:32.931
Like somebody touching, like,
fingertips but it was so cold.

05:32.999 --> 05:35.867
Right. So, do you avoid coming
down here by yourself?

05:35.902 --> 05:38.103
Yes and this is the part,

05:38.171 --> 05:41.440
-if I can show you
my sewing room back here.
-[Adam and Amy] Yeah.

05:45.746 --> 05:48.547
The one day
I was over here cutting,

05:48.615 --> 05:51.483
I could tell that somebody
was standing in the doorway.

05:51.551 --> 05:53.752
And when I looked up,
there was nobody there.

05:53.820 --> 05:55.287
-[Amy] Mm.
-[Adam] Weird, okay.

05:55.355 --> 05:58.390
And I went upstairs,
I was so upset, like...

05:58.926 --> 06:00.892
It was just too much.

06:00.961 --> 06:01.893
-[Amy] Mm-hm.
-You know.

06:01.962 --> 06:04.129
I'll be down here and, um,

06:04.197 --> 06:06.665
when I'm sewing, I'll have
a ironing board set up
over there.

06:06.733 --> 06:08.500
And I'll go to
my ironing board,

06:08.568 --> 06:11.536
when all of a sudden
I'll just hear my machine
start sewing.

06:13.674 --> 06:16.875
Also when I'm sitting here,
my boys... it's supposed to be
the other way around,

06:16.910 --> 06:18.810
that I should be having
this conversation with them.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.545
But they always say, "Mom,
your music is so loud."

06:20.914 --> 06:22.948
But I do it because
I'm always hearing...

06:23.884 --> 06:25.050
people talking.

06:25.118 --> 06:27.819
-Mm-hm
-And like if I have my mu--
I try to like...

06:27.855 --> 06:30.122
block it out.
Like, I'll hear
somebody whistling.

06:30.190 --> 06:31.723
I've heard whistling
behind me.

06:31.792 --> 06:35.861
-[Adam] Hm.
-I've heard
just muffled voices.

06:35.929 --> 06:40.065
The activity you've described,
it just sounds like it's just
so at home here.

06:40.133 --> 06:41.833
-[Missy] Mm-hm.
-Like it's just not
shy at all.

06:41.869 --> 06:42.968
[Missy] Not at all.

06:43.036 --> 06:46.071
Yeah. So, where is like,
the angry, aggressive,

06:46.139 --> 06:47.773
violent activity
that's happened?

06:47.841 --> 06:51.743
The attic is, yeah it's...
It's a hotspot.

06:51.812 --> 06:53.545
-Can we go to the attic?
-[Amy and Missy] To the attic?

06:53.680 --> 06:55.280
-Okay.
-[Missy] Okay.

06:57.818 --> 07:00.952
So, in front of the attic door
even before we even go up,

07:01.021 --> 07:03.855
was where my 16-year-old,
Anthony, just came out
in the middle of the night

07:03.891 --> 07:06.091
to go get a drink. He had his
headphones on.

07:06.159 --> 07:09.060
And he heard
like a muffled conversation
behind him.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.096
Like a man and a woman,
it sounded like.

07:11.164 --> 07:12.531
He couldn't make out
what they were saying,

07:12.566 --> 07:14.933
and he took his
headphones off.

07:14.968 --> 07:18.703
And in front of this door,
he just saw a full body,
like shadow man.

07:18.772 --> 07:21.139
-He said he was
really tall.
-[Amy] Hm.

07:21.208 --> 07:23.875
[Missy] He couldn't make out
any features 'cause it was
just like a black...

07:23.911 --> 07:24.810
-shadow.
-Right.

07:24.845 --> 07:26.244
-Should we, um--
-[Amy] Can we go up?

07:26.313 --> 07:26.878
-Should we go up?
-[Missy] Yes.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.880
[Amy] All right.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.817
So, for me, the whole feeling
changes, like halfway
up the stairs.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.385
-[Amy] Okay.
-Okay.

07:39.927 --> 07:42.394
I don't feel
comfortable up here.

07:42.462 --> 07:45.697
I get the feeling
that there's something that
doesn't want me up here.

07:45.765 --> 07:46.998
Okay.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.868
This all started when Joe,
the one that did the ductwork,

07:49.936 --> 07:51.803
he found the things
in the rafters.

07:51.872 --> 07:53.138
[Amy] What did he find
in the rafters?

07:53.206 --> 07:55.874
-He found the bowler hat.
-[Amy] A bowler hat?

07:55.942 --> 07:57.676
[Missy] So, this is the hat.

07:57.744 --> 07:59.544
-[Adam] Oh.
-[Amy] So, you found this
in the rafters

07:59.646 --> 08:00.846
-when you were renovating
up here?
-[Missy] Yes.

08:00.881 --> 08:05.383
And that's when the feeling
up here seemed to change.

08:07.855 --> 08:11.857
Apparently, this is also where
the original owner
hung himself,

08:11.925 --> 08:13.258
-as well.
-Here?

08:14.094 --> 08:16.995
-[Missy] Yes.
-Wow.

08:17.097 --> 08:18.497
When did that happen?

08:18.565 --> 08:20.899
-[Missy] Apparently
in the '60s.
-In the '60s.

08:20.967 --> 08:22.767
-[Adam] The original owner
of this house--
-[Missy] Yes.

08:22.836 --> 08:25.537
-Hung himself up here.
-Death by suicide.

08:25.572 --> 08:29.541
The story is,
apparently his, um, son...

08:29.676 --> 08:33.712
drowned in the pond
that was on the property.
That has been filled in since.

08:33.780 --> 08:36.081
-[Adam] Oh.
-[Amy] [bleep]. Okay.

08:36.116 --> 08:40.185
-And he was so distressed
by his son's death...
-[Amy] Mm-hm.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.521
that he came up here
and committed suicide.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.456
So, the...

08:44.524 --> 08:46.558
The drowning of the child,
how old was the child?

08:46.626 --> 08:50.996
-Well, he was only 10 or 11
when he drowned.
-[Amy] Okay.

08:51.064 --> 08:53.498
-Have you verified
any of this information?
-[Missy] I have not.

08:53.567 --> 08:55.901
-I heard that from
a lot of the neighbors.
-Mm-hm.

08:55.969 --> 08:57.736
And then what year
was this built?

08:57.804 --> 09:00.071
-It was built in '52.
-'52.

09:00.140 --> 09:01.540
Right, there was
a bunch of immigrants,

09:01.608 --> 09:02.974
Polish immigrants
that came over at once

09:03.043 --> 09:06.077
and they all started
this whole row of houses.

09:06.146 --> 09:08.914
We have the only house
that doesn't have

09:08.949 --> 09:10.782
descendants of
the original owners

09:10.817 --> 09:12.951
-that still live in the house.
-Interesting.

09:12.986 --> 09:16.555
What is your goal for us.
Like what do you
want us to accomplish?

09:16.924 --> 09:19.257
I would like to not be afraid
to leave my bedroom
in the middle of the night.

09:19.326 --> 09:21.693
I'm 48, I shouldn't be
hiding under the covers.

09:21.761 --> 09:22.861
Yeah.

09:22.929 --> 09:24.529
[Missy] This is supposed to be
my sanctuary,

09:24.798 --> 09:26.297
-my safe place.
-[Amy] Right, yeah.

09:26.366 --> 09:29.401
[Missy] And you know, now
especially, we're trying to
make it into...

09:29.636 --> 09:31.236
my dream house.

09:31.304 --> 09:33.171
-[Amy] Mm-hm.
-[Missy] Like, I just,
I'm attached to the house.

09:33.239 --> 09:34.239
I love it, but--

09:34.241 --> 09:35.907
-[Adam] Right.
-[Missy] But I'm so afraid.

09:35.976 --> 09:38.610
[Amy] So, Missy's really just
in the beginning stages

09:38.678 --> 09:40.712
of kind of shifting everything
in this house.

09:40.780 --> 09:42.747
But as they've already started
this process,

09:42.816 --> 09:45.717
the paranormal activity
in the home
has gotten to a point

09:45.752 --> 09:49.287
that they cannot ignore it
anymore and they barely
want to live with it.

09:49.356 --> 09:52.691
I think for us, we're going to
have to figure out
why there's a spirit here

09:52.726 --> 09:54.926
that feels so strongly
that nothing should change?

09:54.995 --> 09:57.996
And then, we're going to
have to figure out how to...

09:58.031 --> 10:01.232
restore some sort of normalcy
here for Missy.

10:05.906 --> 10:08.707
[Adam] The attic seems to be
the source of
Missy's problems.

10:08.742 --> 10:11.009
It's also where
a potential suicide occurred,

10:11.077 --> 10:14.079
and where we'll start
our investigation.

10:14.648 --> 10:17.849
If there's anybody up here
in the attic...

10:17.917 --> 10:19.851
I'm going to take
the trigger object
proximity sensor

10:19.919 --> 10:21.486
and hook it to this hat.

10:22.956 --> 10:25.523
And if you get near
this device or touch this hat,

10:25.559 --> 10:28.493
this is going to make a noise.

10:28.561 --> 10:32.397
Missy feels like you're not
happy with the changes
to the attic.

10:33.734 --> 10:37.702
Missy said that once
they found this hat of yours,

10:37.771 --> 10:40.472
you got upset. Is that true?

10:40.507 --> 10:44.075
Can you just say your name
for us, as loud as you can?

10:46.013 --> 10:49.347
Do you know if someone
ended their life in this room?

10:50.283 --> 10:54.152
Now we also know that
sadly, a little boy drowned

10:54.220 --> 10:56.154
in the pond in the back.

10:56.957 --> 10:59.257
Do you know who that was?

10:59.726 --> 11:01.926
[whispers]
Let's listen to this.

11:01.995 --> 11:05.764
<i> [Amy] Missy said that once we,</i>
<i>  they found this hat of yours,</i>

11:05.832 --> 11:09.167
<i>  you got upset. Is that true?</i>

11:09.202 --> 11:12.070
<i>  Can you just say your name</i>
<i>  for us, as loud as you can?</i>

11:12.138 --> 11:13.104
[static noise]

11:13.173 --> 11:14.973
[inaudible].

11:16.076 --> 11:17.676
-I hear like two syllables.
-Yeah.

11:17.744 --> 11:19.143
Just like something.

11:19.513 --> 11:22.113
[Amy]
<i>  Can you just say your name</i>
<i>  for us, as loud as you can?</i>

11:22.149 --> 11:24.015
[inaudible].

11:24.050 --> 11:25.316
[Adam] That's,
that's hard to hear.

11:25.384 --> 11:28.453
<i> [Amy] Do you know if someone</i>
<i> ended their life in this room?</i>

11:30.323 --> 11:30.955
<i> [electronic voice] No.</i>

11:31.024 --> 11:33.024
Oh, did he say no?

11:38.765 --> 11:40.398
<i> [Amy] Do you know if someone</i>
<i> ended their life in this room?</i>

11:42.269 --> 11:43.501
<i> [electronic voice] No.</i>

11:43.570 --> 11:45.637
No. That's a definite no.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.138
-Yeah.
-[Amy] That is a definite no.

11:47.174 --> 11:49.741
-Yeah.
-Does that sound like
an acc...an accent?

11:49.776 --> 11:52.544
-Like, "I don't know."
-It's like...

11:52.746 --> 11:56.548
<i> [Amy] Now we also know that</i>
<i>  sadly, a little boy drowned</i>

11:56.750 --> 11:58.249
<i>  in the pond in the back.</i>

11:59.186 --> 12:00.952
<i>  Do you know who that was?</i>

12:01.020 --> 12:02.821
[inaudible].

12:02.889 --> 12:06.624
I don't know.
I just think that like...

12:06.660 --> 12:09.994
I think we're getting them...
I think we're kind of
getting warmed up.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.696
Like, they're getting
used to us a little bit.

12:11.732 --> 12:13.031
-Yeah.
-Because this is new to them.

12:13.066 --> 12:16.501
[Adam] Yeah, yeah. Here's a,
a weird idea.

12:16.536 --> 12:18.837
We need somebody
to connect with this object.

12:18.905 --> 12:22.273
And namely the person that...

12:22.342 --> 12:26.444
we were impressed with,
that we've helped on a case,
that could come in...

12:27.147 --> 12:29.080
and potentially...

12:29.149 --> 12:31.683
help us. Because
Chip can't travel right now.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.618
Heather. Heather, um,

12:33.686 --> 12:36.688
from Graestone Manor,
'cause they're only like
an hour away.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.958
-[Adam] Right.
-'Cause she is really good
with that kind of work.

12:40.026 --> 12:42.994
[Adam] We have something here.
It's a trigger object of sorts

12:43.029 --> 12:44.763
and Amy's going to put it
on the table.

12:44.831 --> 12:47.499
[Amy] All we need is

12:47.567 --> 12:49.934
your feelings
humming off of it.

12:51.171 --> 12:52.236
[Heather] I'm getting earth.

12:52.305 --> 12:56.541
Or like, bones of burial...
ground, cemetery dirt.

12:56.576 --> 12:58.810
We should have her come and...

12:58.845 --> 13:01.012
-Yeah.
-Touch this hat and
see what she reads.

13:01.080 --> 13:02.814
Yeah, I mean, we'll do
a walk-through with Chip,

13:02.849 --> 13:04.048
we'll see what
Chip gets, obviously.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.950
-Mm-hm.
-And it would be
really interesting to see if

13:06.019 --> 13:08.787
-he picks up on certain things
and she does as well.
-Yeah.

13:08.855 --> 13:11.289
-Connected to these objects.
-Mm-hm.

13:11.357 --> 13:14.993
So I guess,
tomorrow we come in
with all of our tricks,

13:15.061 --> 13:19.264
and hopefully
we get some answers.

13:26.406 --> 13:30.341
<i> [Amy] We're not getting</i>
<i>  activity that's going</i>
<i>  to further answer us.</i>

13:30.410 --> 13:34.078
<i>  It's so important that they</i>
<i>  talk to us and let us know</i>
<i>  what's going on,</i>

13:34.147 --> 13:39.217
<i>  so that we can kind of</i>
<i>  make this a more</i>
<i>  peaceful place for everyone.</i>

13:43.924 --> 13:46.524
[Amy] We're at
the local Historical Society.

13:46.626 --> 13:48.893
We're just digging around
through their old newspaper
archives and things,

13:48.962 --> 13:50.929
trying to see if we can find
any information

13:50.997 --> 13:54.332
on the family
that was in the house
before Missy.

13:54.367 --> 13:56.167
Or just kind of,
a history of the town,

13:56.236 --> 14:00.004
to see if anything notable
happened nearby that might be
of interest to us.

14:00.841 --> 14:04.909
The house was actually
built by Thomas Giavetta.

14:04.944 --> 14:10.315
But he sold it to...
Stephan Michalski.

14:13.220 --> 14:17.188
All right. So we've got
their son, Stephan's
death certificate.

14:17.223 --> 14:18.990
So he was named
after the father.

14:19.058 --> 14:21.826
-[Adam] Then, this child.
-Mm-hm.

14:21.862 --> 14:25.296
Stephan Michalski
was six years old.

14:25.966 --> 14:28.132
He died in the pond
behind the house.

14:28.201 --> 14:31.002
-So, it was not a rumor.
-That's really sad.

14:34.074 --> 14:35.306
[Amy] Oh.

14:37.510 --> 14:39.477
[Adam] Stephan Michalski.

14:39.545 --> 14:43.481
So, this is Stephan's. We have
both of their burial records.

14:43.549 --> 14:47.285
Now that I have a death date
for the elder Stephan,
let me look him up.

14:47.353 --> 14:49.287
I'll bring out my computer.

14:51.725 --> 14:54.192
Here he is. Oh, [bleep].

14:54.260 --> 14:56.661
I think I just found something
really, really bizarre.

14:56.696 --> 14:58.329
So...

14:59.532 --> 15:02.267
-You know how their son died
in the pond.
-[Adam] Yeah.

15:02.302 --> 15:03.935
[Amy] In 1963.

15:04.003 --> 15:05.503
-[Adam] Okay.
-[Amy] And so then,

15:05.571 --> 15:07.805
the dad died in 1982.

15:07.874 --> 15:11.643
The dad does not
hang himself or anything,
he lives out his days.

15:11.711 --> 15:12.643
He didn't die in the house.

15:12.712 --> 15:14.712
-[Adam] Right.
-[Amy] He died in hospital.

15:14.781 --> 15:18.049
<i> [Amy] Do you know if someone</i>
<i> ended their life in this room?</i>

15:18.117 --> 15:20.018
<i> -[electronic voice] No.</i>
<i> -No.</i>

15:20.053 --> 15:21.953
Oh, my [bleep].

15:22.021 --> 15:23.721
What happened to the mom?

15:23.790 --> 15:25.490
[Amy] Her name was Emilia.
She lived in a nursing home
and died in a nursing home.

15:25.525 --> 15:27.325
[Adam] What I find really,
really interesting is,

15:27.393 --> 15:29.794
yes, we can confirm,
there was a child that died
in the pond.

15:29.862 --> 15:31.963
But, but, good news,

15:32.031 --> 15:35.033
you know, the man did not
hang himself in the attic.

15:35.068 --> 15:37.468
Now it's like, it's a totally
different case now.

15:37.537 --> 15:38.936
-[Adam] Yeah.
-It's a totally
different case.

15:39.105 --> 15:42.073
So we can take the hanging
off the table. No one died
in the attic.

15:42.141 --> 15:44.509
-Right, which is a plus
for Missy.
-That's great for her.

15:44.577 --> 15:48.046
She just, she can eliminate
that vision from her brain.

15:48.081 --> 15:52.450
-Yes.
-But there's something
in the attic that upset them.

15:52.485 --> 15:55.420
That upset someone when they
started digging in there.

15:55.521 --> 15:58.957
-I wonder if Chip picks up
on anything up there.
-Yeah.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.797
-[Amy] Hey, Chip.
-[Adam] Hi, Chip.

16:05.832 --> 16:06.931
<i> [Chip] Hello guys.</i>

16:07.000 --> 16:09.200
Have you gotten any reads
before we get started?

16:09.268 --> 16:11.169
<i> [Chip] Let's get started</i>
<i>  and I'll tell you</i>
<i>  if I'm getting things.</i>

16:11.237 --> 16:12.937
-Okay.
-Okay.

16:15.976 --> 16:17.842
<i> [Amy] Okay, can I show you</i>
<i>  the backyard?</i>

16:17.910 --> 16:20.144
[Chip]
<i>  Absolutely, please.</i>

16:20.880 --> 16:22.847
<i> [Amy] All right. So...</i>

16:22.915 --> 16:27.085
I just want to point
in this back direction
and see...

16:30.223 --> 16:32.290
if you pick up
anything out here.

16:32.392 --> 16:33.191
Yep.

16:33.259 --> 16:34.892
<i> [Amy] What are you picking up?</i>

16:34.928 --> 16:36.594
If you dig deep enough,

16:36.662 --> 16:38.863
you may find out
there's somebody buried
in that backyard.

16:38.931 --> 16:40.565
-Okay.
<i> -[Chip] It's either that</i>
<i>  or somebody's,</i>

16:40.767 --> 16:43.067
with cremation, they scattered
their ashes there.

16:43.136 --> 16:44.535
I don't know what it is.

16:44.738 --> 16:46.337
Oh, really? Okay.

16:48.108 --> 16:49.374
-Okay.
-Remember the...

16:50.543 --> 16:51.743
-Yeah.
-Okay.

16:51.811 --> 16:54.045
-Yeah.
-His, um, son

16:54.113 --> 16:58.249
drowned in the pond
that was on the property.
That has been filled in since.

16:58.284 --> 17:00.251
-Okay.
-[Adam] Okay.

17:05.125 --> 17:06.124
<i> [Amy] Okay.</i>

17:10.597 --> 17:12.030
Trouble sleeping?

17:12.098 --> 17:15.633
<i>  -There's fear going on</i>
<i>  in this space.</i>
<i> -Okay.</i>

17:15.701 --> 17:20.438
Those two things
pretty strongly apply to
this specific space.

17:23.943 --> 17:26.377
Okay, I'm getting creeped out.
Keep going.

17:40.994 --> 17:42.994
I just got a shiver
up my spine for some reason,

17:43.062 --> 17:45.229
like something
hides out in there.

17:46.733 --> 17:49.333
There's fear going on in,
in this house.

17:50.203 --> 17:51.903
<i> -[Amy] Yes.</i>
<i>  -There's noises</i>

17:51.938 --> 17:54.272
<i>  that are heard in this space.</i>

17:54.307 --> 17:57.508
[Amy] Hm. Do you get
anything from this?

18:06.920 --> 18:08.619
-Yep.
-[Amy]
<i>  What are you picking up?</i>

18:08.688 --> 18:11.055
The hat belongs
to a dead person.

18:15.962 --> 18:18.296
<i>  I mean, I think that</i>
<i>  there's some activity</i>
<i>  surrounding that.</i>

18:18.364 --> 18:21.165
It's a, it's an active thing.

18:23.069 --> 18:24.335
Anger.

18:27.774 --> 18:28.806
Anger issues.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.074
<i> [Amy] Anger issues? Okay.</i>

18:30.143 --> 18:31.809
<i>  Anything else?</i>

18:31.878 --> 18:34.479
There's a grandmother-looking
woman that's in the space.

18:35.115 --> 18:39.250
-She's...
weathered-looking.
<i> -[Amy] Mm-hm.</i>

18:39.318 --> 18:41.452
Either short hair
or hair pulled back in a bun.

18:41.955 --> 18:43.488
<i>  She's slight.</i>

18:44.357 --> 18:48.126
Um, we've one more
place to take you, though.

18:55.034 --> 19:00.071
Audible noises that come from
this place that
they try to ignore but can't.

19:00.907 --> 19:04.041
[whispers]

19:04.110 --> 19:07.211
It's like a hide-and-go-seek,
being able to hideout
in here.

19:07.981 --> 19:09.280
<i> -[Amy] Okay.</i>
<i> -[Adam] Okay.</i>

19:09.348 --> 19:11.114
Let's try over here.

19:13.853 --> 19:17.255
<i> [Chip] I'm going to say that</i>
<i>  the old woman's got some</i>
<i>  connection with this space.</i>

19:21.161 --> 19:23.828
<i>  The old woman is OCD.</i>

19:23.896 --> 19:24.896
<i>  Very methodical.</i>

19:24.964 --> 19:27.565
She's really stressed.

19:27.800 --> 19:30.601
<i>  There's a very decisive,</i>
<i>  very protective feeling</i>
<i>  in this room.</i>

19:30.670 --> 19:32.336
<i> [Amy] Oh, okay.</i>

19:32.338 --> 19:37.375
<i>  So is there a name or like</i>
<i>  a letter to the name</i>
<i>  or anything of that woman?</i>

19:38.745 --> 19:41.145
It's an A or a strong A sound.

19:41.981 --> 19:44.749
Oh... I mean, I don't know.

19:44.784 --> 19:46.884
What happened to the mom?

19:46.953 --> 19:49.487
Her name was Emilia.
She lived in a nursing home
and died in a nursing home.

19:57.230 --> 19:58.729
Any other parting words?

19:58.765 --> 20:01.132
I would encourage

20:01.167 --> 20:04.001
people to just
share and share.

20:04.070 --> 20:06.170
<i> -[Adam] Okay.</i>
<i> -Because I don't think</i>
<i> it's been overshared yet.</i>

20:06.239 --> 20:07.505
-[Amy] Okay.
-Okay.

20:07.573 --> 20:09.340
-All good to know.
-Yeah.

20:10.743 --> 20:13.311
All right. Let's just go,
let's keep going,
keep digging.

20:13.379 --> 20:15.279
[Amy] I mean,
it's quite the mystery.

20:17.383 --> 20:20.117
<i> [Amy] A while ago,</i>
<i>  we did a case nearby here,</i>
<i>  at Graestone Manor,</i>

20:20.186 --> 20:24.255
<i>  and our client, Heather,</i>
<i>  was actually</i>
<i>  a very gifted psychic.</i>

20:25.959 --> 20:27.758
Hi, welcome, welcome.

20:27.827 --> 20:29.794
Here, it's kind of
dark in here.

20:29.862 --> 20:33.130
[Amy] And Adam and I were both
super impressed
with her abilities,

20:33.199 --> 20:34.832
especially when
it came to psychometry,

20:34.900 --> 20:37.101
which is where you hold
an object

20:37.169 --> 20:41.439
and you're able to tell
a story as to where it's been,
who it belonged to.

20:42.575 --> 20:46.177
We just want to hand you
this hat. And we want to

20:46.212 --> 20:49.947
get any feedback
you have on it, what you feel
from this at all.

20:54.287 --> 20:57.521
Right away I'm getting,
like my heart is racing
with this.

20:57.657 --> 20:59.056
There's a lot of weird energy.

20:59.092 --> 21:02.326
First thing I'm getting is
like a grandfather
type figure.

21:02.996 --> 21:05.730
I'm getting like
a funny accent with this,

21:05.765 --> 21:07.298
Polish descent,
but it seems like he's...

21:07.366 --> 21:09.500
That there's an accent
with this hat.

21:10.536 --> 21:11.635
<i> [electronic voice] No.</i>

21:11.671 --> 21:14.005
Does that sound like
an acc...an accent?

21:14.040 --> 21:16.240
-Like, "I don't know."
-It's like...

21:16.943 --> 21:18.943
[Heather]
He was like old school.

21:18.978 --> 21:20.778
Almost like not happy, like,
I think this house was
neat as a pin.

21:20.846 --> 21:23.047
Like everything
would have been
perfectly put in place.

21:23.082 --> 21:27.385
And, I think he's upset
because there's been
so much stuff going on.

21:29.489 --> 21:31.656
I don't know if there was
a female connected with him.

21:31.724 --> 21:34.825
-Okay.
-[Heather] 'Cause she's still
stepping across first.

21:34.861 --> 21:36.961
-Oh okay.
-[Heather] Almost like
the couple lived here.

21:36.996 --> 21:40.231
There's a
grandmother-looking woman
that's in the space. She's...

21:40.767 --> 21:42.133
weathered-looking.

21:42.201 --> 21:44.035
[Heather] Because I was
getting a lot in the basement.

21:44.070 --> 21:46.537
-[Amy] You were.
-Or drawn to the basement.

21:46.773 --> 21:48.272
-[Adam] Basement.
-Let's go to the basement.

22:04.023 --> 22:05.856
[Heather] I feel like

22:05.925 --> 22:08.359
this may have been
like a workshop area for him,
or he might've spent time...

22:08.427 --> 22:09.760
It's almost like
that was his spot.

22:09.828 --> 22:12.697
I felt the stairs.
Like there's something
weird about this area.

22:12.765 --> 22:14.832
[Heather] Yeah. It pulled me
right. I don't want to say
"It pulled me down."

22:14.900 --> 22:17.702
-[Adam] What in hell was that?
-Yeah.

22:17.770 --> 22:20.671
-It's like, on the side of
my face like this like--
-Oh, weird.

22:20.740 --> 22:25.776
Why would he suddenly be more
aware and active?

22:25.845 --> 22:28.779
[Heather] Well, he's reaching
out, almost like he wants
people to know,

22:28.848 --> 22:32.049
that it's like his house
as well and they're changing
some stuff in the house.

22:32.118 --> 22:34.518
That's like
changing his floorplan.

22:34.587 --> 22:35.853
It's like stirring stuff up.

22:35.921 --> 22:37.254
So, he sort of hang out
in the basement,

22:37.322 --> 22:39.824
'cause the basement still
looks sort of like
what it looked like.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.525
I'm not seeing a big
difference in the basement,

22:41.627 --> 22:43.294
as far as what
I'm getting with him.

22:43.329 --> 22:45.563
[Adam] I want to take you
to one more spot.

22:51.637 --> 22:53.938
So, anything in here?

22:54.006 --> 22:56.207
Yeah, I think
they get quite
a bit of activity in here.

22:56.275 --> 22:58.809
Shadow people
and things like that. Touched.

22:58.878 --> 23:01.345
I don't know
if they've even had,

23:01.380 --> 23:02.913
like, bedcovers moved on them.

23:02.949 --> 23:05.182
Things like that. There's like
a lot of activity.

23:05.218 --> 23:06.817
I think that this might have
been there room.

23:06.886 --> 23:09.019
-Oh, okay.
-[Heather] At least his room.

23:09.088 --> 23:12.823
Um, yeah, I would say,
this seems
very weirdly active.

23:12.892 --> 23:15.526
And it's wooden floors.
I don't know if they
hear sounds,

23:15.594 --> 23:17.294
like footsteps as well.

23:17.363 --> 23:19.797
It definitely feels like
his energy sort of stays.

23:19.865 --> 23:22.066
-Okay.
-[Heather] She might've even
been here after.

23:22.134 --> 23:23.901
And like, he just sort of
watched this part,
like, 'cause...

23:23.969 --> 23:25.102
Okay.

23:25.104 --> 23:27.071
And I think he was worried
about leaving her here.

23:27.106 --> 23:30.040
So when he died before her
he hung around
to take care of her.

23:30.075 --> 23:31.041
I was getting disturbed sleep.

23:31.110 --> 23:32.676
[Amy] Chip picked up
on that, remember?

23:32.712 --> 23:34.111
[Adam] Yeah. Well you,
you've definitely helped us.

23:34.146 --> 23:36.480
You've confirmed some things
that we've already known.

23:36.549 --> 23:39.183
-And given us some direction
that we needed.
-[Adam] Right.

23:39.251 --> 23:42.720
It's also you've picked up on
some things that corelate
with what Chip said.

23:42.788 --> 23:43.921
-All right.
-All right,

23:43.989 --> 23:45.723
-well, thank you so much.
-Thank you, Heather.

23:45.791 --> 23:47.491
-[Amy] We appreciate it.
-[Heather] Absolutely.

23:51.497 --> 23:52.963
<i> [Adam] Heather picked up</i>
<i>  on the fact</i>

23:52.999 --> 23:56.100
<i>  that Missy's room</i>
<i>  might have been</i>
<i>  Mr. Michalski's bedroom.</i>

23:56.168 --> 23:58.002
<i>  So, that's where we'll start.</i>

23:58.704 --> 24:00.538
This is where the most

24:00.606 --> 24:05.109
weird and creepy,
uncomfortable activity
has happened.

24:08.948 --> 24:11.615
So, what I'm doing now
is I'm laying out the deeds.

24:11.684 --> 24:15.085
These all have different names
on them of people
who have been in the house

24:15.120 --> 24:18.522
at one time or another,
that we got from research.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.992
Oh, that's really pinging.

24:22.061 --> 24:23.327
[Adam] Yeah.

24:25.331 --> 24:27.431
I mean, it's only on that.

24:28.167 --> 24:29.333
Look, nothing.

24:32.205 --> 24:33.938
It's that area.

24:34.040 --> 24:38.142
-That's high.
-I mean, that's crazy.

24:42.215 --> 24:44.915
-[Amy] It's weird,
it just stopped.
-[Adam] This makes no sense.

24:44.984 --> 24:47.184
Oh.

24:47.253 --> 24:49.720
-[Amy] What?
-What if something
was sitting on the bed?

24:49.788 --> 24:53.090
-That's right. Remember
she said that?
-Yeah.

24:59.098 --> 25:01.165
I'm going to,
I'm going to record,

25:01.233 --> 25:03.501
because this will
record your voice.

25:03.569 --> 25:06.570
-My name is Adam.
This is Amy.
-[Amy] Hi.

25:06.639 --> 25:10.274
Can you tell me what
your last name is,
what your family name is.

25:10.342 --> 25:12.476
As loud as you can, please,
your last name.

25:12.512 --> 25:13.477
Oh.

25:20.353 --> 25:22.019
[Amy] This is
lighting up again.

25:23.789 --> 25:25.356
Whoever's in this house
with us...

25:26.058 --> 25:27.992
that is non-living.

25:31.063 --> 25:33.564
We're here
at the request of Missy.

25:35.935 --> 25:37.668
She wants us to talk to you.

25:37.736 --> 25:39.770
Um, what's running?

25:39.838 --> 25:40.938
[Adam] Here, hold that.
Let me got check.

25:41.006 --> 25:42.940
'Cause if it does that again,

25:43.008 --> 25:45.476
I mean, I'll get out
of the way if you want to
sit down

25:45.544 --> 25:47.711
with my friend Amy, there.
[gasps]

25:47.747 --> 25:49.046
[Amy] Oh.

25:49.081 --> 25:51.715
-Okay.
-[Adam] Like, for real.

25:51.751 --> 25:55.185
-[Amy] You can sit here.
-[Adam] Wait a second.

25:55.221 --> 25:56.954
-[Amy] What?
-[Adam] Oh, my [bleep].

25:57.022 --> 25:57.888
[Amy] What?

25:57.957 --> 25:59.657
-The faucet is on.
-Wait, wait, wait, wait.

25:59.725 --> 26:01.792
I just washed my hands
in the dark.

26:01.860 --> 26:03.761
So, it's a very good chance
I did not turn it off
all the way.

26:03.829 --> 26:05.529
-[Adam] Okay.
-Yeah.

26:05.731 --> 26:07.498
-'Cause I literally
just washed my hands.
-What if they were like,

26:07.566 --> 26:08.899
"You've left the water on."

26:08.968 --> 26:10.434
-[Amy] Maybe, turn it off.
-[Adam] Okay.

26:10.502 --> 26:12.536
I'm going to
turn of the water,

26:12.805 --> 26:15.406
-I just turned off the water.
-[Amy] In turn, it stopped.

26:19.545 --> 26:20.844
Were you, um,

26:20.846 --> 26:22.746
were you trying to
let us know, that I left
the water on?

26:22.815 --> 26:24.014
I'm sorry, I washed my hands
in the dark,

26:24.050 --> 26:27.017
and I must not have noticed.

26:28.988 --> 26:32.089
You know what,
turn it back on.
And we'll see what happens.

26:35.962 --> 26:38.529
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, oho, Adam.
-[Adam] What.

26:38.597 --> 26:40.864
-[Amy] It's started lighting
up again, like crazy.
-[Adam] Okay.

26:40.933 --> 26:43.434
-We're going to keep...
We'll turn it off.
-[Amy] We'll turn it off.

26:43.502 --> 26:45.569
-We won't leave it open.
-[Adam] We don't want to
waste water.

26:47.907 --> 26:50.307
-That's crazy.
-It's in line though,
with what she says,

26:50.343 --> 26:52.977
that it's very protective
of the house.

26:56.582 --> 27:00.250
Can you tell me what year
you lived here?

27:02.221 --> 27:05.189
[Adam] Can you tell us
the year that you died?

27:08.728 --> 27:11.729
We're really trying to
figure out who you are.

27:11.797 --> 27:15.199
For Missy's sake
and her family's sake.

27:15.267 --> 27:19.136
Are you happy
with the renovations
that are being done

27:19.171 --> 27:20.838
to this house?

27:20.906 --> 27:24.541
Well, let's listen to this
and see if it's working.

27:24.644 --> 27:28.212
[Amy]
<i>  Can you tell me what year</i>
<i>  you lived here?</i>

27:28.981 --> 27:31.715
<i> [Adam] Tell us</i>
<i>  the year that you died?</i>

27:31.784 --> 27:34.084
<i>  We're really trying to</i>
<i>  figure out who you are.</i>

27:34.120 --> 27:37.554
<i>  For Missy's sake</i>
<i>  and her family's sake.</i>

27:39.925 --> 27:41.959
Nothing.

27:41.994 --> 27:44.428
If, if you are in here
and you are
communicating with us,

27:44.496 --> 27:46.030
and now you're being shy,

27:46.098 --> 27:47.865
-[Amy] Thanks for trying.
We'll be back tomorrow.
-[Adam] Yeah, we--

27:47.933 --> 27:50.000
[Amy] We're not
going anywhere.

27:53.973 --> 27:58.642
If I was not
a paranormal investigator,
this would be terrifying.

27:58.678 --> 28:01.745
-Right.
-[Amy] And for this to be
happening every single day,

28:01.814 --> 28:03.547
like, no wonder
why she is so desperate.

28:03.816 --> 28:05.816
And that's just
minor activity.

28:05.884 --> 28:07.217
[Adam] Yeah, that's not,

28:07.286 --> 28:09.753
I mean, that's not "we're
renovating a space" activity.

28:09.822 --> 28:11.488
And if the...

28:12.958 --> 28:16.393
idea that whatever's
here is protective,

28:16.429 --> 28:17.761
then we need to trigger that.

28:17.830 --> 28:20.464
[Amy] We need a little push.

28:22.668 --> 28:26.770
As much as we
don't like to make anyone,
alive or dead, uncomfortable,

28:26.839 --> 28:29.640
sometimes we do have to,
to push it a little bit,

28:29.708 --> 28:32.042
just to get the answers
we need.

28:36.982 --> 28:41.085
What if tonight
we just move everything
all around?

28:41.120 --> 28:42.986
And see what happens? Yeah.

28:43.055 --> 28:45.989
Just complete disarray and see
if anything happened.

28:46.058 --> 28:47.057
-Yeah.
-[Amy] Um--

28:47.126 --> 28:49.193
-Yeah.
-[Amy] I think
we start with that.

28:49.929 --> 28:52.529
I mean, I think we need to
like, literally like,

28:52.732 --> 28:55.365
-move things, like way...
-[Adam] Yeah,
move this out of the way.

29:08.781 --> 29:10.981
Okay, let's go
to the basement.

29:17.923 --> 29:19.556
[Amy] All right,
I think we did enough.

29:19.759 --> 29:21.492
I think we've done
enough damage here.

29:22.128 --> 29:24.061
We'll see what happens.

29:30.035 --> 29:31.902
So, right now we're back.
We're in the basement

29:31.970 --> 29:37.074
and now that we've messed up
the whole house,
we're wondering if...

29:37.142 --> 29:40.210
maybe something
will interact with us.

29:40.246 --> 29:42.379
That's our version
of provoking.

29:42.447 --> 29:44.481
It is making a messy house.

29:44.950 --> 29:46.383
[sighs]

29:46.451 --> 29:48.252
Why don't we split up?
What if you can go over there?

29:48.320 --> 29:49.787
-Yeah.
-Why don't we do that.

29:49.855 --> 29:51.955
I'll stand over here.

29:54.894 --> 29:59.029
Can you make a sound
where you are,
so we know you're here?

29:59.064 --> 30:03.033
What do you think about
the mess that has been made
of this house.

30:03.068 --> 30:05.169
Does that make you angry?

30:06.005 --> 30:08.539
Do you want us to put it back?
Do you want us to fix it?

30:10.976 --> 30:12.876
[Amy] What can we do
to the house right now,

30:12.945 --> 30:14.978
to make you
feel better about it.

30:16.148 --> 30:19.383
[Adam] It seems like
you're the original owner

30:19.418 --> 30:22.319
of the house. Stephan,
is that, is that true?

30:23.189 --> 30:26.089
[Amy] These are good people
in your house.

30:29.094 --> 30:33.163
You're lucky
that they're here
to carry this on for you.

30:33.799 --> 30:37.401
Because if they get too upset,
they'll leave.

30:38.070 --> 30:40.971
And there's no guarantee
who will come here next,

30:41.039 --> 30:43.941
and whether they'll even
keep this house standing.

30:44.710 --> 30:46.777
Can you please just...

30:46.845 --> 30:50.948
acknowledge that you will try
to peacefully co-exist

30:50.983 --> 30:53.417
with Missy, from here on out?

30:55.888 --> 30:59.122
Okay, I'm going to play this.
Let's see what...

31:03.796 --> 31:04.661
<i> [electronic voice] Yes.</i>

31:04.730 --> 31:06.463
[Amy] It says, "Yes."

31:10.970 --> 31:13.070
<i> -[electronic voice] Yes.</i>
<i> -[Adam] Yeah.</i>

31:13.973 --> 31:16.039
<i> [Amy] What can we do</i>
<i>  to the house right now,</i>

31:16.075 --> 31:17.941
<i>  to make you</i>
<i>  feel better about it.</i>

31:18.010 --> 31:19.776
[electronic voice]
<i>  Clean it up.</i>

31:19.812 --> 31:21.011
Oh.

31:22.781 --> 31:25.082
It says, "Clean it up."
Really loud.

31:25.150 --> 31:26.884
[Amy]
<i>  What can we do</i>
<i>  to the house right now,</i>

31:26.952 --> 31:28.218
<i>  to make you</i>
<i>  feel better about it.</i>

31:28.287 --> 31:30.053
[electronic voice]
<i>  Clean it up.</i>

31:30.122 --> 31:33.724
[Amy] That is so bizarre.

31:33.759 --> 31:38.929
<i> [Adam] It seems like</i>
<i>  you're the original owner</i>
<i>  of the house.</i>

31:38.964 --> 31:41.131
<i>  Stephan, is that,</i>
<i>  is that true?</i>

31:41.199 --> 31:42.833
<i> [electronic voice] It's true.</i>

31:42.868 --> 31:44.434
-[Amy] It's true?
-[Adam] Yeah.

31:44.503 --> 31:46.270
<i> [Amy] Can you please just...</i>

31:46.305 --> 31:51.008
<i>  acknowledge that you will try</i>
<i>  to peacefully co-exist</i>

31:51.043 --> 31:53.277
<i>  with Missy, from here on out?</i>

31:54.546 --> 31:57.347
Well, no answer on living
peacefully with Missy.

32:01.854 --> 32:02.552
Wait.

32:04.957 --> 32:06.690
Did someone talk?

32:06.725 --> 32:10.694
I just heard like
a full-on voice in the corner
over here.

32:10.729 --> 32:13.063
It was coming from
Missy's sewing room.

32:13.131 --> 32:16.233
-It sounded like a female.
-Hm.

32:19.438 --> 32:20.871
It was just like a chat--

32:20.939 --> 32:22.773
You know, and we know that
Missy says that
she hears voices

32:22.841 --> 32:23.941
down here all the time.

32:24.009 --> 32:26.443
You stay here and I'll go
to the sewing room.

32:34.119 --> 32:36.086
So, right now,
Adam and I have separated.

32:36.121 --> 32:38.221
Um, I am in the sewing room,

32:38.290 --> 32:40.891
and he's on the other side
of the wall in the basement.

32:40.959 --> 32:41.992
And he's going
to ask questions

32:42.060 --> 32:44.494
and I'm going to listen
to the spirit box,

32:44.563 --> 32:47.831
with a blindfold on and
noise-cancelling headphones.

32:47.899 --> 32:49.967
And I'll just say whatever it
is that I hear.

32:53.572 --> 32:56.974
[Adam] If there's anyone
in this basement,
my name is Adam.

32:57.042 --> 33:01.378
And my friend, Amy,
is sitting in Missy's
sewing room.

33:01.446 --> 33:03.080
All you have to do,

33:03.816 --> 33:05.048
is...

33:05.250 --> 33:07.384
use the device Amy has...

33:08.153 --> 33:09.186
and talk with us.

33:09.254 --> 33:12.255
So, if you could, speak to us?

33:14.059 --> 33:15.192
Through the static.

33:17.096 --> 33:18.462
Use Amy...

33:19.264 --> 33:21.131
to communicate with us.

33:21.166 --> 33:22.399
"Who is this?"

33:23.869 --> 33:24.968
[Adam] My name is Adam.

33:25.037 --> 33:26.970
"Always trying."

33:28.273 --> 33:30.741
Yeah. We're always trying
to speak to you.

33:30.809 --> 33:31.775
We're not going to stop.

33:31.843 --> 33:34.811
My goal is to help
Missy and her family

33:34.880 --> 33:36.480
who are currently
living in this house.

33:37.383 --> 33:39.049
Do you understand that?

33:39.084 --> 33:41.418
Can you tell me
what you name is?

33:43.122 --> 33:46.423
I'm looking
for Stephan Michalski...

33:47.159 --> 33:49.226
Emilia Michalski...

33:49.294 --> 33:50.560
[Amy] "Both of them."

33:52.231 --> 33:54.531
-[Adam] Please
step forward, Emilia--
-[Amy] "I'm trying."

33:56.001 --> 33:57.034
[Adam] I know.

33:57.102 --> 33:58.935
But Emilia, I'm asking you,

33:58.971 --> 34:02.039
if there's a message that you
would like us to tell Missy?

34:02.140 --> 34:04.174
"She hears us."

34:04.242 --> 34:06.843
[Adam] Yeah,
she does hear you,
she does hear you.

34:06.912 --> 34:08.545
Is there someone in here?

34:11.517 --> 34:15.886
I keep feeling like a...
breeze over my hands.

34:15.921 --> 34:19.089
Like a cold burst of air.

34:19.992 --> 34:23.593
Um...
Missy hears that, feels that
all the time, the cold.

34:23.662 --> 34:25.662
I have been touched down here,
and it,

34:25.730 --> 34:29.066
the one time, it literally,
it just felt like
ice cubes.

34:29.134 --> 34:33.503
Like somebody touching, like,
fingertips but it was so cold.

34:34.873 --> 34:38.041
Okay so, I know,
that she's flipping the attic,

34:38.077 --> 34:40.744
she turned the stairs around.
Do you remember
when she did that?

34:40.812 --> 34:42.979
"I warned them."

34:46.351 --> 34:49.953
She did that because
she needed to make
the stairs to code.

34:50.021 --> 34:51.254
What does that mean?

34:51.289 --> 34:52.589
-And--
-[Amy] Wait.

34:52.624 --> 34:53.957
What?

34:55.360 --> 34:59.062
Do you know
what year it is,
Emilia and Stephan?

34:59.131 --> 35:01.665
It's 2021.

35:01.700 --> 35:03.667
And they have
to update this house

35:03.702 --> 35:05.769
in order for the house
to still stand.

35:05.837 --> 35:07.971
-Do you understand?
-'What do you mean?"

35:08.039 --> 35:11.041
What I mean is, if she doesn't
upkeep this space,

35:11.109 --> 35:14.377
this house will crumble
and fall into the ashes.

35:15.080 --> 35:16.379
[Amy] "Leave."

35:18.851 --> 35:20.951
That's a female voice,
"Leave."

35:21.019 --> 35:22.052
"Wait."

35:22.821 --> 35:24.020
[Adam] What?

35:24.055 --> 35:25.388
"Come back, come back."

35:25.456 --> 35:28.458
But it's like a accent.
It's like, "Come back."
Or something.

35:29.161 --> 35:31.128
There's an accent
with this hat.

35:31.196 --> 35:34.064
It's 2021 and they have
to update this house.

35:34.132 --> 35:36.066
They're going to
update the kitchen.

35:36.301 --> 35:37.467
Do you understand?

35:38.370 --> 35:40.403
"That's rude."

35:40.438 --> 35:46.209
This is deep. This is probably
the craziest spirit box
session I have ever had.

35:49.148 --> 35:51.314
Something just touched
the back of my head.

35:51.984 --> 35:53.550
Right here.

35:53.685 --> 35:55.418
Just touching the back
of my head.

35:59.191 --> 36:01.057
Do you like Missy
and her family?

36:04.963 --> 36:06.963
Oh, that was not English.

36:07.766 --> 36:09.065
<i>  Nie t--</i>

36:09.100 --> 36:10.167
-No.
<i> -[Amy] Nie to...</i>

36:10.235 --> 36:12.402
No. It means no something.

36:13.772 --> 36:15.939
I can't. I can't make out
these words.

36:16.007 --> 36:17.407
-What?
-[Adam] Yep.

36:18.010 --> 36:19.543
It's a man and a woman.

36:19.811 --> 36:21.378
Of course it is.

36:24.082 --> 36:25.448
Tiki... tiki...

36:26.118 --> 36:27.450
I feel like I'm...

36:28.253 --> 36:30.453
I don't know any Polish.

36:30.989 --> 36:32.022
Like...

36:33.025 --> 36:36.393
Okay, um, can you just
try to concentrate.

36:36.461 --> 36:38.995
We're here,
we're trying to help Missy.

36:39.031 --> 36:40.263
"Adam."

36:42.134 --> 36:44.167
Yeah. That's my name.

36:45.537 --> 36:47.938
"What is really happening?"

36:49.841 --> 36:53.944
So, what's really happening
is Missy and her family
are in this house.

36:54.146 --> 36:55.812
And they are...

36:55.847 --> 36:57.948
They've interacted
with someone like you.

36:57.983 --> 37:00.083
We assume that it is Stephan.

37:02.120 --> 37:04.154
And she's scared of you,

37:04.222 --> 37:06.423
because she wants to make
this house a home.

37:06.491 --> 37:09.192
She wants to
make it beautiful.

37:09.261 --> 37:13.396
And I'm asking you if there's
a message that you would like
us to tell Missy?

37:14.032 --> 37:15.465
"I'm tired."

37:16.168 --> 37:18.068
"Can I please stay?"

37:18.604 --> 37:20.103
Yeah.

37:20.138 --> 37:23.206
I'm going to stop my friend,
Amy, from listening,
is that okay?

37:23.275 --> 37:25.942
Okay. Andy, do you mind
tapping her out?

37:27.546 --> 37:29.045
[gasps]

37:29.848 --> 37:32.082
-[bleep].
-[Andy] Hey, girl.

37:35.520 --> 37:37.053
[Amy] All right.

37:39.558 --> 37:41.858
That was the best spirit box
session I have ever had
in my life.

37:41.893 --> 37:43.226
-Are you kidding me?
-[Adam] No.

37:44.062 --> 37:46.463
So, anytime I brought up...

37:47.065 --> 37:51.034
that Missy wants to do
all the work to this house,

37:51.102 --> 37:53.903
-otherwise it would crumble
into the ashes.
-[Amy] Mm-hm.

37:53.972 --> 37:55.505
It would no longer exist.
It would go away.

37:55.573 --> 37:58.174
-[Amy] Right.
-[Adam] They were
getting upset.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.710
[Amy] It seems like
they're still just taking care
of their house.

38:00.779 --> 38:02.646
[Adam] At one point, they just
started speaking Polish,

38:02.714 --> 38:04.481
and they weren't paying
attention any more,
you know.

38:04.549 --> 38:07.183
I will say when that happened,
it was a man and a woman.

38:07.252 --> 38:10.320
-I was hearing two people
bickering about...
-[both] Something.

38:10.388 --> 38:11.688
If you're saying
they're arguing,

38:11.756 --> 38:12.922
I think they're arguing
'cause they get it.

38:12.991 --> 38:15.458
I mean but it's what we
think has been happening.

38:15.527 --> 38:19.562
I mean, he sort of thinks
this is still his home
in a way.

38:19.631 --> 38:22.999
I was speaking to
the original owners
of this property.

38:23.068 --> 38:27.470
I think the original
homeowners really connected
with the fact

38:27.539 --> 38:31.007
that without Missy, this house
would be nothing.
It would be dust.

38:31.042 --> 38:34.911
And so we need to
really tell l them that and
relay that information.

38:34.979 --> 38:37.080
So hopefully, Missy can
renovate this house

38:37.148 --> 38:39.382
and build a life
for her family.

38:49.728 --> 38:51.995
-Missy, welcome back. Um...
-Yes.

38:52.063 --> 38:56.633
When have kind of tried
just about everything,

38:56.701 --> 38:58.735
that we could.

38:58.770 --> 39:01.538
Probably one of the biggest
thing we did is we did
a lot of historical research.

39:01.573 --> 39:03.807
-Okay.
-[Amy] Because we wanted
to know,

39:03.842 --> 39:06.509
-what actually happened
in your home.
-Right.

39:06.578 --> 39:08.078
You've got Mr. Michalski.

39:08.113 --> 39:09.746
Um... He was,

39:09.814 --> 39:12.782
he lived in your home
for a number of years.

39:12.851 --> 39:17.487
And so he was the one
who you thought
had hanged himself.

39:18.123 --> 39:19.489
-In the attic.
-[Adam] Right.

39:19.557 --> 39:20.890
-[Amy] He did not.
-Oh!

39:20.926 --> 39:22.892
He died of a lengthy illness.

39:22.928 --> 39:24.260
-Oh, wow!
-In the hospital.

39:24.295 --> 39:25.261
Oh, wow!
That's amazing to know.

39:25.330 --> 39:27.097
That, like makes me feel
so much better.

39:27.165 --> 39:28.531
That was creepy.

39:28.600 --> 39:31.835
So, let's talk about the
haunting of your house.

39:31.870 --> 39:34.637
So we did do something,
kind of crazy last night.

39:34.673 --> 39:37.674
Because we really did want
to get more evidence.

39:37.742 --> 39:42.545
We went through your house,
and we completely
messed it up.

39:42.714 --> 39:44.948
So I want to play you an EVP
that we got.

39:45.016 --> 39:47.016
-After we did that.
-Oh, jeez.

39:47.085 --> 39:50.186
<i> [Amy] What can we do</i>
<i>  to the house right now,</i>

39:50.255 --> 39:52.555
<i>  to make you</i>
<i>  feel better about it.</i>

39:52.958 --> 39:53.790
<i> [electronic voice] Clean it.</i>

39:53.858 --> 39:57.026
-It says clean it.
-[Missy] Clean it.

39:57.061 --> 39:58.962
-You heard it.
-Wow.

40:00.031 --> 40:03.500
My boys better keep
there rooms clean now.
This may help.

40:03.568 --> 40:06.669
So, we do
this technique we call
l the spirit box experiment.

40:06.705 --> 40:07.670
-Yes.
-[Adam] Where

40:07.739 --> 40:09.572
Amy or I will listen to
the headphones,

40:09.641 --> 40:11.007
and the other member
will ask questions.

40:11.075 --> 40:14.511
And we're blindfolded
when we're listening
to the headphones.

40:14.579 --> 40:16.212
And we don't know what
the other is asking.

40:16.281 --> 40:18.481
-[Missy] Okay.
-But, sometimes,

40:18.550 --> 40:19.983
the answers...

40:20.051 --> 40:21.384
-come together.
-[Missy] Match.

40:21.453 --> 40:23.853
Like, they match and they're
having a conversation.

40:23.922 --> 40:26.956
One of the best spirit box
sessions we've ever had,

40:26.992 --> 40:29.793
-happened here
in your basement.
-Really?

40:29.861 --> 40:31.761
-[Adam] Yeah. So we're
going to show--
-Wow!

40:31.797 --> 40:33.530
[Adam] We're going
to show it to you.

40:36.835 --> 40:38.301
Do you like Missy
and her family?

40:38.336 --> 40:40.837
Just answer me that
before I tap out Amy.

40:40.872 --> 40:43.139
They're cherished.

40:44.309 --> 40:46.676
-So, what do you think
of that?
-[Missy] That's amazing.

40:46.744 --> 40:48.545
So, for you I would say,

40:48.747 --> 40:50.847
anytime you're about to do
something or while
you're doing it,

40:50.882 --> 40:52.449
if things start acting up,

40:52.484 --> 40:55.118
you tell him,
"Hey Mr. Michalski

40:55.153 --> 40:56.920
this is how it is,
wait till you see it
when it's done.

40:56.988 --> 40:58.621
-You're going to love it."
-Okay.

40:58.690 --> 41:01.891
You know, but in the meantime,
I think we should
go up to the attic.

41:01.960 --> 41:04.928
-I think you should say
a few words to Mr. Michalski.
-[Missy] Okay.

41:04.996 --> 41:07.664
-Set the tone.
-Awesome. Great.

41:07.699 --> 41:10.166
Sometimes we encounter
these spirits that,

41:10.235 --> 41:12.602
they're not good at just
kind of gently nudging,

41:12.637 --> 41:14.270
they're more like
a bull in a china shop.

41:14.339 --> 41:16.806
And they come through
and they terrify
these poor families.

41:16.875 --> 41:18.208
When they actually have

41:18.243 --> 41:20.944
intentions that make
more sense once
you do a little digging.

41:21.012 --> 41:23.880
So, I think overall,
Missy understands that.

41:23.948 --> 41:25.949
I think she's going to
take charge of the situation.

41:25.984 --> 41:28.551
Um, and I'm really interested
to see how it goes.

41:28.620 --> 41:31.621
I can't wait to get pictures
of her kitchen and that attic
once they're done.

41:31.689 --> 41:34.757
Stephan, I want you to know,
you're welcome to stay.

41:34.793 --> 41:38.928
I know this is your house
and I'm doing my best
to make it beautiful.

41:38.997 --> 41:41.764
But, the kitchen is going
to get renovated.

41:41.833 --> 41:45.401
And it's going to be
my dream kitchen,
exactly how I want it.

41:45.470 --> 41:47.203
So, it's going to happen.
