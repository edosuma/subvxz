is inherently unequal.

that their goal is,

belief exceptions?

06:02.927 --> 06:04.146
It does not.

Whiteness, as it pertains

06:05.800 --> 06:07.367

conservative perspective

06:10.370 --> 06:12.067
that is neither Christian,

06:12.110 --> 06:13.938
nor historically accurate.

06:13.982 --> 06:16.941
The only difference
between last semester and now,

06:16.985 --> 06:19.379
is that the politics
in this country changed.

06:19.422 --> 06:21.685
And certain
conservative sectors

06:21.729 --> 06:23.992
consider anything
not white-focused

06:24.035 --> 06:25.602
to be anti-American.

06:25.646 --> 06:27.561
Neither of these justifications

06:27.604 --> 06:29.606
are deeply held
religious beliefs.

06:29.650 --> 06:32.304
Rather,
they are designed to discount

a traumatic brain injury.

11:48.577 --> 11:49.970
Can you explain
what that means?

11:50.013 --> 11:51.798
He's gone into a coma,

11:51.841 --> 11:53.538
which generally indicates

11:53.582 --> 11:55.802
widespread damage
or bruising

11:55.845 --> 11:57.020

11:57.064 --> 11:58.674
And if Timothy ever

11:58.718 --> 12:01.198
even regains consciousness,

12:01.242 --> 12:02.765
will he suffer
any side effects?

12:02.809 --> 12:04.332
Yes, it's possible.

12:04.375 --> 12:05.725
There are a multitude

12:05.768 --> 12:06.943
of long-term effects.

12:06.987 --> 12:08.858
Ranging from headaches

12:08.902 --> 12:11.556
to seizures,
even memory loss.

no way of knowing

when he recovers.

12:35.058 --> 12:36.668

could be totally fine.

Timothy could be fine.

12:51.248 --> 12:53.947
But in my experience,
it's not likely.

12:53.990 --> 12:56.863
And in your experience,
as a doctor,

12:56.906 --> 12:59.213
is there a chance
that Timothy

12:59.256 --> 13:01.563
may never
come out of the coma?

really hearing me, Lisa.

everything that's going right.

what else it did?

white Americans uncomfortable.

whether or not
to teach Black history,

in our schools?

to confront the truth.

rather just ignore it.

that we carry, Lisa.

is for people to just

truly comprehended

are going through.

-Yes. Katie had reported it.
-And what was done?

to apologize to Katie.

it would never happen again.

28:44.157 --> 28:45.462
from the trial will somehow

28:45.506 --> 28:47.247
force the school
to make changes.

28:47.290 --> 28:49.249
Ms. Lopez,
your client needs

28:49.292 --> 28:52.556
to seriously consider
resolving this case.

28:54.471 --> 28:55.908
MARK: I'm sorry
we missed the seminar.

28:55.951 --> 28:57.474
I'm sorry
your car broke down.

28:57.518 --> 28:59.694
No, it's all good now.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.174
You know,
I think I got bed bugs

29:01.217 --> 29:02.349
from that damn motel.

29:02.392 --> 29:03.916
[laughs]

29:03.959 --> 29:07.571
This is
the worst road trip ever.

29:07.615 --> 29:09.878
Agreed.

29:09.922 --> 29:11.662
I was really
looking forward to this.

29:11.706 --> 29:13.142
Me too.

29:13.186 --> 29:14.927
Yeah,
but for different reasons.

29:14.970 --> 29:16.885
You were looking forward
to kicking my ass at the debate.

29:16.929 --> 29:18.191
I was actually
looking forward to spending

29:18.234 --> 29:19.322
some quality time with you.

29:19.366 --> 29:21.672
-Really?
-Yeah.

29:21.716 --> 29:23.239
Man, I didn't care
about the debate,

29:23.283 --> 29:24.763
I just wanted
to hang out with you.

29:24.806 --> 29:27.461
-For real?
-Only reason why I'm here.

29:27.504 --> 29:29.550
-Oh, okay. My God.
-[laughs]

29:29.593 --> 29:31.378
Well, we should get--
we gotta make a plan

29:31.421 --> 29:32.901
to do this more often,
all right?

29:32.945 --> 29:34.598
Like a pact, all right?
Once a month.

29:34.642 --> 29:36.992
-Whoa! That will never happen.
-It could.

29:37.036 --> 29:38.777
You're getting married
in 10 weeks.

29:38.820 --> 29:39.908
That's crazy.

29:39.952 --> 29:41.605
Other people make it work.

29:41.649 --> 29:42.781
We can, too.

29:43.520 --> 29:44.957
I'mma hold you to that.

29:46.045 --> 29:47.829
Pow.

29:47.873 --> 29:50.179
With Robin's help,
we uncovered that--

29:55.184 --> 29:56.751
[muffled laugh]

29:56.795 --> 29:58.361
That it was Martin Moore.

29:58.405 --> 30:00.842
You tried his son last year?
Alexander Moore.

30:00.886 --> 30:03.236
He tried to blame his friend
for a murder he committed.

30:03.279 --> 30:05.673
-Martin Moore is his father.
-Right. I remember.

30:05.716 --> 30:07.588
That was Rachel
and Amy's client.

30:07.631 --> 30:10.025
I read that he got his son
out of prison six months ago.

30:10.069 --> 30:12.375
Why would he still
care about going after Lola?

30:12.419 --> 30:15.465
Revenge, Moore blames
everyone involved in the case.

30:15.509 --> 30:18.164
He's told several associates
that he's out to ruin you all.

30:18.207 --> 30:19.556
You need to watch your back.

30:19.600 --> 30:21.254
Her Honor's back
is always watched.

30:21.297 --> 30:25.171
I am not afraid of Martin Moore.

30:25.214 --> 30:28.565
I guess... thanks are in order.
But let me be clear.

30:28.609 --> 30:31.655
This does not change
anything between us.

30:31.699 --> 30:34.571
What you put
Sherri and I through...

30:34.615 --> 30:38.010
-we can never forgive.
-I understand.

30:38.053 --> 30:40.839
And for what it's worth,
I know I made a huge mistake,

30:40.882 --> 30:42.623
and I'm truly sorry.

30:42.666 --> 30:44.712
But I'm determined
to prove myself to you again.

30:44.755 --> 30:46.279
You're the real deal,
Judge Carmichael.

30:46.322 --> 30:47.933
You're destined
for great things.

30:47.976 --> 30:49.630
And there's no doubt
in my mind...

30:50.674 --> 30:52.154
I'm the one
who can get you there.

30:54.243 --> 30:57.159
[upbeat music]

30:59.466 --> 31:01.772
Oh, my God,
the gall of that man.

31:01.816 --> 31:03.426
[Lisa laughs]

31:04.427 --> 31:05.907
I think she likes him.

31:05.951 --> 31:08.431
[laughs]

31:09.258 --> 31:10.477
Uh, so, um...

31:11.782 --> 31:14.133
I thought
a lot about what you said.

31:14.176 --> 31:18.137
These past few years,
I thought my eyes were open.

31:18.180 --> 31:21.792
I thought that I was
helping the greater good.

31:21.836 --> 31:23.969
Reading the books,
attending protests.

31:24.012 --> 31:27.189
I even
put up a BLM sign.

31:27.233 --> 31:28.408
I remember.

31:29.061 --> 31:30.062
Yeah.

31:31.063 --> 31:32.542
It wasn't enough.

31:32.586 --> 31:35.241
To be a true ally
and advocate

31:35.284 --> 31:37.547
is a lifelong commitment.

31:37.591 --> 31:39.767
Having
uncomfortable conversations

31:39.810 --> 31:41.160
not just
with my colleagues,

31:41.203 --> 31:43.336
but with my family
and friends.

31:43.379 --> 31:46.339
And even the neighbor
who complains about my sign.

31:47.340 --> 31:48.645
So you checked Google?

31:48.689 --> 31:51.518
[laughs] Yes, yes.

31:51.561 --> 31:55.914
My favorite was a YouTube series
with Emmanuel Acho,

31:55.957 --> 31:58.568
"Uncomfortable Conversations
with a Black Man".

31:58.612 --> 32:01.180
He said something
that really stuck with me.

32:01.223 --> 32:04.618
"Everything great
is birthed through discomfort."

32:06.315 --> 32:09.449
I hope you know
how much your friendship

32:09.492 --> 32:11.842
means to me, Carmichael.

32:13.018 --> 32:15.759
Back at you,
Lisa Benner.

32:19.154 --> 32:21.548
-[door grinding]
-[footsteps]

32:21.591 --> 32:23.463
Emily?

32:23.506 --> 32:26.031
I'll agree
to strike the GBI allegation.

32:26.074 --> 32:27.902
He can plead
to the felony child endangerment

32:27.946 --> 32:29.251
for the minimum conditions.

32:29.295 --> 32:30.905
It's no jail time,

32:30.949 --> 32:32.820
four years probation
and parenting classes.

32:34.430 --> 32:36.693
Thank you, Rory.
That's a fair deal.

32:36.737 --> 32:38.739
You're not the only one
who was troubled over this case.

32:38.782 --> 32:39.958
I have three kids.

32:40.784 --> 32:42.003
I'll take it to my client.

32:42.047 --> 32:43.309
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

32:48.227 --> 32:49.706
-Jim.
-Hey.

32:49.750 --> 32:52.187
-Hey. Listen.
-[Jim clears his throat]

32:54.668 --> 32:57.279
The DA has just
given us a good offer.

32:57.323 --> 32:59.629
I really think
you should consider taking it.

32:59.673 --> 33:01.327
MAN: Hang in there, Jim.

33:01.370 --> 33:04.199
There are parents here
to show their support.

33:04.243 --> 33:06.288
I have been trying
for two years

33:06.332 --> 33:07.724
to get someone
to pay attention.

33:07.768 --> 33:09.248
I cannot give up now.

33:09.291 --> 33:11.337
Jim, please, I'm--

33:11.380 --> 33:14.688
-Just think of Katie.
-I am thinking of her.

33:14.731 --> 33:17.430
Something has to change.
The bullying has to stop.

33:17.473 --> 33:21.042
And if going to prison for
trying to protect my daughter

33:21.086 --> 33:23.001
is the only way
to make a difference then...

33:24.524 --> 33:25.655
so be it.

33:26.569 --> 33:27.701
Jim...

33:38.712 --> 33:40.975
[upbeat music]

33:41.019 --> 33:43.195
Before I call
the jury back in,

33:43.238 --> 33:45.632
the court was informed
the People made an offer.

33:45.675 --> 33:47.677
-We have, Your Honor.
-Your Honor...

33:47.721 --> 33:50.941
I ask for time for my client
to consider the offer.

33:52.856 --> 33:54.858
Very well,
you have until tomorrow.

33:54.902 --> 33:58.340
Ms. Lopez,
may I speak with your client?

33:58.384 --> 33:59.776
Of course, Your Honor.

34:03.519 --> 34:07.219
Mr. Evans, I would like
to speak to you not as a judge,

34:07.262 --> 34:09.395
but as a fellow parent.

34:09.438 --> 34:13.833
I understand
the need to do something.

34:13.877 --> 34:18.882
To... help change the system
when we see a wrong.

34:18.926 --> 34:21.407
But what you did...

34:21.449 --> 34:24.627
taking matters into your own
hands, has repercussions.

34:24.670 --> 34:28.109
You put a child
into the hospital.

34:28.152 --> 34:30.371
And if you are found guilty,
you could spend up to

34:30.416 --> 34:33.810
nine years in prison.
That is a long time

34:33.853 --> 34:35.420
to be away
from your daughter.

34:35.464 --> 34:38.685
A daughter
who needs you right now.

34:39.512 --> 34:41.340
Please, Mr. Evans.

34:41.382 --> 34:43.429
Take this time

34:43.472 --> 34:45.518
to really
consider your decision.

34:47.085 --> 34:49.652
I will.
Thank you, Your Honor.

34:49.696 --> 34:51.263
The court is adjourned
until 9 a.m.

34:51.306 --> 34:52.481
[gavel clacking]

34:57.094 --> 34:58.748
-Hey.
-Hi.

34:58.792 --> 35:01.055
Listen,
I have some good news.

35:01.099 --> 35:03.536
Timothy's parents weren't in
the courtroom earlier because...

35:04.189 --> 35:05.842
...he woke up.

35:05.886 --> 35:08.018
It was only for a few moments,
but he-- he--

35:08.062 --> 35:10.412
he woke up!
He's making progress.

35:10.456 --> 35:11.544
Oh, thank God.

35:12.240 --> 35:14.155
That's amazing news.

35:14.199 --> 35:15.635
I wanted to run
something else past you.

35:15.678 --> 35:18.725
I found
an amazing therapist.

35:18.768 --> 35:20.205
She's agreed
to work with Katie.

35:20.248 --> 35:22.032
She has
no connection to the school,

35:22.076 --> 35:23.469
so Katie
won't have to worry

35:23.512 --> 35:24.948
about the other kids
finding out.

35:26.428 --> 35:28.648
Thank you, Ms. Lopez.

35:28.691 --> 35:30.737
I appreciate
everything you've done.

35:30.780 --> 35:32.782
You're welcome.

35:32.826 --> 35:36.003
But there is one last thing
we need to discuss.

35:39.311 --> 35:40.834
Prosecution's offer.

35:40.877 --> 35:42.749
[sighs]

35:44.272 --> 35:46.100
Your Honor.

35:46.144 --> 35:48.015
Ms. Lopez and Mr. Faez
are here to see you.

35:48.058 --> 35:49.538
Oh, send them in.

35:51.714 --> 35:53.499
Thanks, Ms. Kansky.

35:53.542 --> 35:56.241
My client, Your Honor,
has decided to accept the offer.

35:56.284 --> 35:58.678
Very well.
I have considered the offer

35:58.721 --> 36:00.767
and am willing
to go along with it.

36:00.810 --> 36:03.073
We will take the plea in
the morning and excuse the jury.

36:03.117 --> 36:04.945
Thank you, Mr. Faez.

36:04.988 --> 36:06.294
It's a pleasure,
Your Honor.

36:06.338 --> 36:07.382
-Thank you.
-Great.

36:09.210 --> 36:10.907
And Your Honor,
I wanted to thank you

36:10.951 --> 36:12.648
for your
parent-to-parent speech.

36:12.692 --> 36:14.433
I know that's...
absolutely

36:14.476 --> 36:15.869
why my client
changed his mind.

36:16.565 --> 36:17.610
You're welcome.

36:20.395 --> 36:21.483
What is it?

36:21.527 --> 36:23.006
Just...

36:23.050 --> 36:25.052
as a parent, how--

36:25.095 --> 36:28.621
How do you watch
something like this case

36:28.664 --> 36:31.145
and not let it
just totally...

36:32.625 --> 36:34.453
utterly consume you?

36:37.978 --> 36:40.720
Life is full of fear.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.027
And hope.

36:44.071 --> 36:45.855
And I choose
to hold on to the hope.

36:50.860 --> 36:51.992
Come on.

36:55.082 --> 36:56.431
[elevator dings]

36:59.565 --> 37:01.131
Em.

37:01.175 --> 37:03.221
-You made it back.
-I did.

37:05.788 --> 37:07.529
Muah

37:07.573 --> 37:10.271
Hey, is it okay if we just
grab takeout and go home?

37:10.315 --> 37:11.751
I really need to shower.

37:11.794 --> 37:13.622
-Perfect.
-Pizza?

37:14.406 --> 37:15.972
I was thinking Mexican.

37:16.016 --> 37:18.627
-Ooh, El--
-Padían.

37:18.671 --> 37:20.238
Yes, absolutely.

37:21.108 --> 37:22.196
Hey, uh...

37:23.676 --> 37:27.245
Were you serious
about not wanting kids?

37:28.071 --> 37:29.377
Honestly, babe...

37:30.509 --> 37:32.032
this case was brutal!
It was...

37:33.642 --> 37:35.514
And everything that's going on
in the world right now?

37:36.819 --> 37:40.649
There are so many reasons
not to have kids.

37:40.693 --> 37:43.783
I really...
Want to be a dad.

37:43.826 --> 37:47.743
And I see kids
in my future.

37:47.787 --> 37:49.876
And I know the world
is a messed up place,

37:49.919 --> 37:51.660
but isn't that even more
reason to have them?

37:51.704 --> 37:53.271
How is that
a reason to have them?

37:53.314 --> 37:55.969
Because they are the future.

37:56.012 --> 37:57.797
And there's a chance
that they might be the ones

37:57.840 --> 37:59.929
that get it right.

37:59.973 --> 38:03.193
I wish that I could...
say to you all the things

38:03.237 --> 38:05.108
that you want to hear,
that you need to hear.

38:05.152 --> 38:08.329
I wish that I could tell you
with certainty that one day,

38:08.373 --> 38:10.505
yes, I want to have kids,
but I'm just...

38:11.767 --> 38:13.160
I'm not there.

-Are you serious?
-You stink! Yes.

I was afraid
to shower at the hotel.

38:36.836 --> 38:38.490
Everything had
mold growing on it.

38:38.533 --> 38:40.535
You could have
at least changed your clothes.

38:40.579 --> 38:43.843
What don't you understand about
mold growing on everything?

I'm too nervous. I can't look.

-No.

Denying education
