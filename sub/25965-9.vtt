Frazier:
Maurice and Anderson had fought

he was easy money.

00:15.483 --> 00:17.282
Easy money!

Easy -- Easy money.
He said it -- "Easy money." See?

00:20.254 --> 00:21.453
And then
he told Justin pretty much,

00:21.489 --> 00:23.055
he hits like a --

Maurice and Justin had been
drinking earlier that day.

02:49.603 --> 02:51.904
Maurice was being a little loud.

02:51.939 --> 02:53.305
I don't know
if the term "belligerent"

02:53.340 --> 02:56.475
was applicable in this case, but
he definitely was being loud.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.777
We just felt
that those situations

02:58.812 --> 03:00.946
were unbecoming
of Team Gastelum team members.

All right.

You said I was
easy money, right?

04:15.322 --> 04:16.655

-Hello?!
-Hello?!

Sosoli:
I think Maurice drank too much.

04:24.498 --> 04:26.431
As long as he's drinking beers,
he's fine.

04:26.467 --> 04:28.100
But as soon as he hits the
Henne, then --

04:28.135 --> 04:31.470
then that's when he starts
turning into a hood guy,

04:31.505 --> 04:33.305
even though he's not
from the hood.

04:33.340 --> 04:35.741

Sosoli: I think there's
a language barrier.

04:54.595 --> 04:57.496
There's, like, a bit of a
communication breakdown there.

04:57.531 --> 04:59.498
And yeah,
he kind of lost his cool,

04:59.533 --> 05:01.700
went off a lot
at Anderson.

05:01.735 --> 05:04.403
Anderson's joking,
but if you see Anderson joking,

05:04.438 --> 05:07.105
sometimes it's hard to tell
that he's really joking.

05:07.141 --> 05:10.475

of course you're not gonna know.

were having a few drinks,

06:11.038 --> 06:12.437

So, all the team, we want to get
back to the house straight away.

06:14.675 --> 06:18.410
It's good to let them just
party -- party down a little bit

06:18.445 --> 06:22.180
while we're just out of the way
and just doing our thing.

06:22.216 --> 06:24.583
Justin was saying
to Anderson,

06:24.618 --> 06:28.387
"You're easy money for me,"
after he beat him.

06:28.422 --> 06:30.856
And then Anderson,
he was joking around a bit,

06:30.891 --> 06:32.557
and then
Maurice lost it.

06:32.593 --> 06:34.059
Oh, I can see
that happening.

06:34.094 --> 06:37.295
Everyone at dinner, we just hung
out for a little bit, you know?

06:37.331 --> 06:39.698
It's good to just try
and act normal and be normal,

06:39.733 --> 06:41.800
considering that we're locked
in the house with everyone,

06:41.835 --> 06:43.235
and it was fight day.

06:43.270 --> 06:45.003
So, I think it was a good way
to just break the tensions,

06:45.038 --> 06:47.339
enjoy each other's company,
and just hang out.

06:47.374 --> 06:50.175
Greene: [ Slurring ] Listen --
When Anderson gets back,

06:50.210 --> 06:52.277
I'mma [bleep] with Anderson

06:52.312 --> 06:56.782
Where's that Hennessy?

06:56.817 --> 06:59.418

06:59.453 --> 07:02.053

to me, you?

07:02.089 --> 07:04.956
We still got
a conversation to finish.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.191
She's like,
"[Bleep] you.

07:06.226 --> 07:09.194
I don't want to talk
to your ass no more.

07:09.229 --> 07:10.896
You're an [bleep]."

07:10.931 --> 07:15.100

person who typically runs away

07:15.135 --> 07:19.304
from any particular scenario
or problem or situation.

07:19.339 --> 07:22.774
Maybe not as bad, but...

07:22.810 --> 07:25.610
you can only take so much
of people's [bleep].

07:25.646 --> 07:28.914
It's no way to carry yourself
as an athlete,

07:28.949 --> 07:31.249
or for that matter,
any human being.

07:31.285 --> 07:32.918
I don't know.
I feel sorry for the people

07:32.953 --> 07:35.821
who even want to [bleep] buy
a piece of crochet from you,

07:35.856 --> 07:38.557
'cause it ain't worth [bleep]

07:38.592 --> 07:44.362

07:49.703 --> 07:51.870
Gastelum: The preliminary fights
are all done,

07:51.905 --> 07:53.438
so now we're coming over
to Macy's.

07:53.474 --> 07:55.140
She won her fight.
We're really excited for her.

07:55.175 --> 07:56.842
And not only
did she win her fight,

07:56.877 --> 07:59.978
it's also gonna be
her birthday tomorrow,

08:00.013 --> 08:03.381
so, uh, we came by to kind of
celebrate her victory

08:03.417 --> 08:05.150
and also give her
a little present

08:05.185 --> 08:06.918
for her birthday coming up.

It was nice to have the coaches
come over and kind of celebrate.

08:14.294 --> 08:17.696
They got me a nice bottle
of Don Julio 1942.

08:17.731 --> 08:19.598
It's pretty sick.

08:19.633 --> 08:23.568
Uh, and, uh, and the guys got me
some balloons and a cake.

08:23.604 --> 08:24.903
And you know, it felt nice.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.338
It felt like I was at home.

08:26.373 --> 08:28.907
Are you causing
trouble? Huh?

08:28.942 --> 08:30.575
Why -- Why are you --

08:30.611 --> 08:32.244
What?

08:32.279 --> 08:33.879
Why am I drinking?
'Cause I got one night

08:33.914 --> 08:36.681
until I go back to work,
and it's like, "Pbht!"

08:36.717 --> 08:38.216
Okay.

08:38.252 --> 08:41.086
'Cause you only give me a break
for one night, Coach!
Shh.

08:41.121 --> 08:43.622
Hunsinger:
When we got to the house today,
I walked in with Kelvin.

08:43.657 --> 08:45.056
Maurice definitely
stood out.

08:45.092 --> 08:46.758
He was extremely loud.

08:46.793 --> 08:49.694
He's anxious for his semifinals
fight, which is understandable.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.630
But at the same time,
this is not the conduct

08:51.665 --> 08:54.266
in which we want our team
to represented of,

08:54.301 --> 08:57.402
especially by somebody who
we expect to be in the finals.

08:57.437 --> 08:59.538
I've been around
a lot of world champions.

08:59.573 --> 09:02.040
I've never seen them
act this way,

09:02.075 --> 09:04.409
never seen them
talk this way.

09:04.478 --> 09:07.045
All [bleep] aside, okay.
Okay, Coach.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.613
Yes, sir.

09:08.649 --> 09:11.182
Gastelum: It's a bad
representation of our team.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.652
It's a bad representation of
who we are as martial artists.

09:13.687 --> 09:16.087
It's a bad representation
of himself.

09:16.123 --> 09:18.523
He's got a family at home
that's gonna be watching,

09:18.559 --> 09:20.792
and he needs to behave himself.

09:20.827 --> 09:23.662
But the other team don't give me
no respect I'm deserved,

09:23.697 --> 09:25.130
so [bleep] them.

09:25.165 --> 09:26.831
That's how I feel.
[Bleep] them.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.466
You're wasting
too much mental energy,

09:28.502 --> 09:31.069
when you can
just focus on you.

09:31.104 --> 09:33.471
Focus on winning
this tournament.

09:33.507 --> 09:35.707
Because right now,
you're deviating from that.

09:35.742 --> 09:38.944
Save all that energy,
because you're gonna need it.

09:38.979 --> 09:40.712
This is not
gonna be easy.

09:40.747 --> 09:43.348
I cry daily, but this is
an emotional moment.

09:43.383 --> 09:44.583
Then stay focused.

09:44.618 --> 09:46.117
I'm just an
emotional human being.

09:46.153 --> 09:48.887
Let's just -- It's okay.
We love you for it.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.989
But let's
just stay focused.

09:51.024 --> 09:53.391
It's awesome to have, you know,
people who kind of care about

09:53.427 --> 09:55.226
your wellbeing
and want to see you do well,

09:55.262 --> 09:57.362
despite what's

that it was fitting...

not a good look here

going off the deep end, so...

I don't want to be that guy
to put you in a position

27:24.210 --> 27:26.110

and end something

27:26.145 --> 27:28.379

to come do.

not to be.

27:36.956 --> 27:39.423
So, I apologize,
and I'm shameful for it,

27:39.458 --> 27:41.825
and, you know, there's nothing
I can do to change that

27:41.861 --> 27:43.694
at this point and time.

27:43.729 --> 27:47.965
Ultimately, it was me
who started all of this.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.034
But, yeah, I shed
a couple tears for that, just --

27:50.069 --> 27:53.170
in just being embarrassing
and being selfish in the moment,

27:53.205 --> 27:55.139

I shouldn't have been.

you are a really nice guy,

40:39.471 --> 40:41.070
I wanted to --
I wanted to fight.

40:41.106 --> 40:42.539
I wanted to stand and trade.

40:42.574 --> 40:44.641
And I knew that I was gonna win
that battle, win, lose, or draw.

40:44.676 --> 40:46.976
I was gonna leave it all
in there trying to.

40:47.012 --> 40:50.113

40:50.148 --> 40:53.950
Justin came into the competition
at 30, 35 pounds over, you know?

40:53.985 --> 40:57.353
And, um, he's had
quite a transformation

40:57.389 --> 40:59.189
during the season.

40:59.224 --> 41:00.890
So [bleep]

41:00.926 --> 41:02.091
Perfect game play.

41:02.127 --> 41:03.726
Very happy for Justin.

41:03.762 --> 41:06.095
I mean, he is one of those guys

41:06.131 --> 41:10.200
that kind of just has
a similar story to mine, really.

41:10.235 --> 41:13.002
He just kind of was down here
at the bottom of the list,

41:13.038 --> 41:16.239
but he has risen
to every occasion

41:16.274 --> 41:18.775
and made a complete 180
during the season.

41:18.810 --> 41:20.877
And, uh, I couldn't be
more proud.

41:20.912 --> 41:25.048
Couldn't be more excited for
his future and for the finale.
