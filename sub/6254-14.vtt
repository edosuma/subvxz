the victim is female.

Great. Okay, Mr. Wizard,
how do we stop it
from melting everything?

03:48.562 --> 03:52.896
Well, the killer probably used
common household cleaner,
so water would do the trick.

I mean, I could use
the pressure hose and just—

03:55.194 --> 03:57.856

could cause the bone

10:49.775 --> 10:51.356
Yes.

10:51.443 --> 10:53.684
She had decided
that l was, uh—

10:53.821 --> 10:55.311
[ Chuckles ]
stodgy.
Mmm.

10:55.405 --> 10:57.361
Our forensic team notes
that she sustained...

10:57.449 --> 11:00.065
a number of injuries
after your separation.

for viable candidates
for a new wife.

11:09.586 --> 11:11.838
Okay. I think you told me
everything I need to know,

11:11.922 --> 11:15.585
except, um, where were you last night
when your wife was murdered?

11:15.676 --> 11:17.166
l was at the hospital.

11:17.261 --> 11:19.047
I got out of there
about 2:00 am.

11:19.179 --> 11:23.138
Can anyone corroborate that?
Check with the hospital.
People know me there.

11:24.977 --> 11:27.889
G.P.S. on Melinda Perkins’s
watch places her...

11:27.980 --> 11:30.141
not in the slaughterhouse
at time of death,

11:30.232 --> 11:32.848
but approximately
100 meters east.

11:32.943 --> 11:35.650
[ Booth ]
Okay, so she’s either in
or near the warehouse.

11:35.737 --> 11:37.898
Do you think
the victim’s ex—husband
lured her out here?

11:37.990 --> 11:40.857
Uh, he’s got an alibi.
Maybe the victim
was kidnapped, right?

11:40.993 --> 11:42.824
[ Groans ]
She escaped and she ran.
Hold on, hold on.

11:42.911 --> 11:45.698
— Ma’am? Ma’am, are you okay?
— Has someone attacked you?

11:45.789 --> 11:48.622
I’m fine. It was—
It was just an accident.

11:51.295 --> 11:54.332
— [ Man ] All right, wall it out. Wall it out.
— ,r,r [ Background: Loud Rock]

11:56.383 --> 11:58.123
What is that?

11:58.218 --> 12:01.881
That is roller derby, Bones.
Look at that.

12:01.972 --> 12:03.678
[Laughs]

12:03.765 --> 12:06.017
Here we go.
Here we go.

12:06.101 --> 12:07.637
All right, nice.
Wall it out.

12:07.728 --> 12:09.309
VVhoo.VVhoa!

12:11.773 --> 12:13.388
[Whistle Blows ]

12:13.483 --> 12:15.439
Bring it in.
Bring it in.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.314
Name’s Bennett.
Nick Bennett.
I own the team.

12:18.405 --> 12:21.488
No one owns
the Derby Dolls, Nickie.
We’re a cooperative.

12:21.575 --> 12:22.985
[Benneﬂ]
That barely breaks even.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.577
I built the track.
I manage the team.

12:24.661 --> 12:26.276
But ’cause I don’t have boobs,
that doesn’t mean anything.

12:26.371 --> 12:28.578
- And don’t forget it.
- I’m sorry. I didn’t get your name.

12:28.665 --> 12:30.280
Susan Carroll,

12:30.375 --> 12:32.366
but everybody here
calls me Emily Kickinson.

12:32.461 --> 12:34.417
- [ Laughs] That’s like Emily Dickinson.
— Right.

12:34.504 --> 12:36.586
Okay, does anyone recognize
this woman here?

Yeah.
That’s Pummel—ya Anderson.

12:38.842 --> 12:42.005
[ Brennan ]
Ah. These names are amusing.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.756
I should give names
to my interns.

12:43.847 --> 12:46.805
Peter Patella, Timothy Tibia.

12:50.479 --> 12:52.515
She was murdered last night.

12:52.606 --> 12:54.972
- Somewhere in this facility.
— Oh, God.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.689
When’s the last time
you saw Melinda?
Last night.

12:56.777 --> 12:58.608
We had a match
against The Virginia Slims.

12:58.695 --> 13:00.310
We all went out for drinks
aftenNards,

13:00.405 --> 13:02.361
but Melinda said that
she wasn’t feeling too well.

13:02.449 --> 13:05.282
- Did she get injured?
- No more than usual.
She was tough.

13:05.369 --> 13:07.655
The woman took her punishment
for the past year with no complaints.

13:07.746 --> 13:10.954
That would explain the injuries
that appeared to be domestic abuse.

13:11.041 --> 13:12.497
Anyone here who’d want
to hurt Melinda?

13:12.584 --> 13:14.745
No! This team’s a family.

13:14.836 --> 13:16.417
We’re like sisters.

— Have you heard
from lvanna today?
— Oh, God.

— [ Stammers ]
— Who’s lvanna?

13:20.550 --> 13:23.337

She didn’t show up
for practice today either.

13:23.428 --> 13:26.295
You guys gotta see if she’s okay.
What the hell is going on around here?

What the hell are you
looking at me for?
[ Booth ] Okay, look.

13:28.558 --> 13:30.890
I’m gonna need
lvanna’s home address
and her cell number.

13:31.019 --> 13:32.475
And her real name—
Yeah.

13:32.562 --> 13:34.723
if it isn’t lvanna Kick Ass.

13:38.360 --> 13:41.193
Hey, so the particulates
l swabbed from
the skull injuries...

13:41.279 --> 13:44.567
show traces of polyurethane
and sandarac resin.

13:44.700 --> 13:47.316
Meaning?
Meaning it’s a wheel
from a roller skate...

13:47.411 --> 13:49.777
that picked up the resin
from the varnish on the track.

13:49.871 --> 13:52.954
So we have cause of death.
She was beaten with a skate.

13:53.041 --> 13:54.497
Yeah.

13:54.584 --> 13:57.917
Can you match
the varnish to the track
the Derby Dolls use?

13:58.005 --> 14:02.669
Yeah. Piece of cake—
which I wish I had now
to celebrate your big day.

14:02.759 --> 14:04.215
[ Exhales ]
It’s not necessary.

14:04.302 --> 14:06.509
Hey, have you made
your pre—30 bucket list yet?

14:06.638 --> 14:08.845
I didn’t know
that was a thing.
Yeah.

14:08.974 --> 14:12.091
Everybody knows there are things
you cannot do after 30
without being a real loser.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.686
I doubt that.
Young at heart.

14:13.770 --> 14:15.226
That’s what my grandpa
used to say.

14:15.313 --> 14:17.349
Look, can we just focus
on the case?

14:17.441 --> 14:20.057
We—We have cause of death.
We just have to tie it to someone.

14:20.152 --> 14:22.393
Well, there have to be tons
of skates at the rink.

14:22.487 --> 14:24.773
Your grandpa’s wrong,
by the way. Okay?

14:24.906 --> 14:27.568
How about dating
a crazy girl?
What?

14:27.659 --> 14:31.322
Dating a girl that you know is nuts,
but you just have to do it anyway,

14:31.413 --> 14:33.028
even though you know
it’s going to end badly.

14:33.165 --> 14:36.032

Phew.
Okay.

Posing naked
for a hot art student.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.462
That is still a big regret of mine.

14:46.595 --> 14:48.881
Done it.
Not a student though.
Really?

14:50.807 --> 14:53.924
— I don’t want to talk
about this anymore.
- Well— [ Scoffs ]

You knew that.

is finished, okay?

End of discussion.
I’m fine.

No complaints.
Yeah, of course not,

for my wife.

Look at this.
What?

15:17.626 --> 15:19.082
I don’t know.
I just said that.

Can we just forget
about this?

15:21.171 --> 15:23.662
Please? It’ll be
my birthday present.

15:24.341 --> 15:26.332
[ Exhales ]
Fine.

15:26.426 --> 15:29.668

Sometimes I hate
being an adult.

15:37.312 --> 15:38.768
Yes, very.

15:38.897 --> 15:42.230
But you’re not, like,
busy busy, right?
Actually very busy busy.

15:42.317 --> 15:44.103
I might have found toxins
in the victim.

15:44.236 --> 15:47.478
Oh. So you’re almost done.
What is it, Angela?

15:47.572 --> 15:50.484
Booth. [Stammers]
Have you heard anything?

15:50.575 --> 15:52.907
About what?

15:52.994 --> 15:54.734
| feel like something’s wrong.

15:54.830 --> 15:57.412
Brennan was on
the phone with him,
and he was at the hospital.

15:57.541 --> 16:00.578
And she won’t
talk about it.
She wouldn’t tell you?

16:00.669 --> 16:03.206
I know, right?
I mean, she tells me everything.

16:03.296 --> 16:06.038
ljust thought, you know,
since you and Booth
were close, that—

16:06.133 --> 16:07.964
No, he hasn’t
said anything to me.

16:08.051 --> 16:10.167
I mean, why the secrecy
if he’s okay, right?

16:10.303 --> 16:13.716
Oh, God. I hate it
when he gets all stoic.
Yeah.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.513
But he has Dr. Brennan.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.682
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

16:17.769 --> 16:20.511
And I’m sure
if they needed anything,
they would ask.

16:20.647 --> 16:23.639
No, they wouldn’t.
No, they would not.

16:23.733 --> 16:25.940

Oh.

16:26.027 --> 16:27.608
Wow. Hydrocodone.

16:27.696 --> 16:29.152
Well, that makes sense.

16:29.239 --> 16:32.106
If she was being
battered at the rink,
she’d need a pain medication.

16:32.200 --> 16:35.192
And did she also need
ecstasy and marijuana...

16:35.287 --> 16:36.777
and methylphenidate?

16:36.872 --> 16:39.579
Oh, not unless
she was a party animal.

16:41.960 --> 16:44.042
Looks like you got
pretty banged up there
from your last match.

16:44.129 --> 16:45.744
Is that why
you missed practice?

16:45.839 --> 16:48.330
I had an exam to study for.

I’m going to night school
to become a physical therapist.

16:51.178 --> 16:53.134
So, what happened to Melinda?

16:53.221 --> 16:54.836
l was hoping
you’d be able to tell me.

16:54.931 --> 16:56.762
You two were pretty, uh,
competitive.

16:56.850 --> 16:58.511
Yeah. So?

16:58.602 --> 17:01.594
Because we’re women,
you don’t think we can
handle competition like men?

17:01.730 --> 17:04.972
- That’s not what I meant.
— You might think it’s harder
for women to bond in a team sport,

17:05.066 --> 17:07.057
but actually,
we make men look pathetic.

17:07.152 --> 17:09.438
I think you need
to take a breath. Okay?

17:09.529 --> 17:11.520
Remember. This is
about Melinda here.

17:11.615 --> 17:13.105
That’s what’s important.

17:13.992 --> 17:17.576
Sorry. She was my friend.

17:17.662 --> 17:20.904
The competition made
each of us better on the rink.

17:20.999 --> 17:22.705
If she was your friend,
did she ever tell you...

17:22.792 --> 17:24.293
aboutanyone
who wanted to hurt her?

17:24.377 --> 17:26.242
She never said anything,

17:26.338 --> 17:28.750
but she lived
a pretty wild life.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.956
Melinda, she’d push it,
you know?

17:31.051 --> 17:32.837
I told her she could get in trouble.

17:32.969 --> 17:35.176
Yeah, drugs. We know.
And guys.

17:35.263 --> 17:36.799
Melinda couldn’t
get enough of them.

17:36.890 --> 17:38.846
She told me
she took this one guy—

17:38.934 --> 17:40.390
I told her it was crazy.

17:40.477 --> 17:43.469
She had sex with him
on the lawn in front
of her ex’s house.

17:45.774 --> 17:47.730
Hey, look, the husband says
that he was at the hospital.

17:47.817 --> 17:51.275
The nurses’ station
have him checking out
after his rounds at 2:00 am.

17:51.363 --> 17:53.399
Which is after time of death.

17:53.490 --> 17:54.980
He still has
the clearest motive.

17:55.075 --> 17:56.736
It’s gotta be difficult
to deal with a woman...

17:56.826 --> 17:58.566
who has sex with another man
right in front of you.

17:58.662 --> 18:01.620
— He’s got an alibi.
— What about the other men
she was involved with?

18:01.706 --> 18:05.198
The groupies? There’s no one
has any names, and there’s
no security cameras to check.

18:05.293 --> 18:08.000
The drug taking,
the public sex,

18:08.088 --> 18:10.204
the putting herself
in physical danger
out on the rink, that’s—

18:10.298 --> 18:11.959
That is extreme behavior.

18:12.050 --> 18:14.006
That could explain
her police record.

18:14.094 --> 18:17.632
Public intoxication,
disturbing the peace,
shoplifting.

18:17.722 --> 18:19.758
Guys, how does
any of this help, okay?

18:19.849 --> 18:22.556
She was killed at the rink,
beaten with a skate.
All right?

18:22.644 --> 18:24.100
The answer is in the rink.

18:24.187 --> 18:27.099
So we go question
everyone at the rink,
get a search warrant.

18:27.190 --> 18:30.523
We’d never be able to get
a warrant to go through
everybody’s personal effects.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.316
They’d think
we were fishing.

18:34.155 --> 18:35.895
There might be another way.

18:35.991 --> 18:37.982
[Sighs]
This is nuts.

18:38.076 --> 18:39.737
No one asked you
to do this, Angie.

18:39.828 --> 18:41.443
Brennan said they were
at a dead end...

18:41.538 --> 18:43.244
unless somebody could
get inside the rink.

18:43.331 --> 18:44.787
You are an artist,
not a cop.

18:44.874 --> 18:48.037
I know, but they need
somebody to go in there
to A.L.S. skates...

18:48.128 --> 18:50.119
and maybe find out
where the victim was killed.

18:50.213 --> 18:52.795
I repeat.
You are an artist, not a cop.

18:52.924 --> 18:54.425
Yeah, but I can skate.
[ Sighs ]

18:54.509 --> 18:57.751
And they need somebody
to replace Melinda,
so I am going to try out.

18:57.846 --> 18:59.427
— It’s perfect.
- Yeah, it’s perfect—

18:59.514 --> 19:02.301
except for the part when
you get horribly disfigured
by the other skaters.

19:02.392 --> 19:06.101
I want to help,
and this will get me out
from behind the computer.

19:06.187 --> 19:08.599
Okay. Okay.
Then we’ll go bungee jumping.

19:08.690 --> 19:11.022
Hey, you fell in love
with a wild woman,
didn’t you?

19:11.109 --> 19:14.146
Yes, a beautiful wild woman.

19:14.237 --> 19:16.478
And that’s
how I will remain.

19:16.573 --> 19:19.906

with Smackie Kennedy.

Of course.
Thank you.

You could thank me by
spreading the word about N.F.,

to the Children’s Tumor Foundation.

anything yet?

32:36.872 --> 32:38.612
Yeah, finally.
It’s about time, right?

32:38.707 --> 32:40.243
Is this about
your birthday again?

32:40.334 --> 32:42.290
No, I’ve just
been frustrated.

32:42.419 --> 32:44.831
I mean, we have cause of death,
but not enough evidence
to arrest anyone.

32:44.964 --> 32:47.296
lsn’t that enough?
Yeah, sure. I just thought—

32:47.383 --> 32:50.250
Look, you’re clearly
dying to know...

32:50.344 --> 32:54.633
what’s been bothering me,
sou.ﬁne.

32:54.723 --> 32:59.012
My brother bet me that
by the time I hit 29,
I’d still be a loser.

32:59.145 --> 33:01.557
You’re not a loser, Wendell.
I know.

33:01.647 --> 33:04.013
I mean, I’m working
with the best people
in their fields,

33:04.108 --> 33:05.814
and they want me
to work with them.

33:05.901 --> 33:07.482
Yeah. We do.

33:07.570 --> 33:10.357
So then he’s wrong.
I’m living the dream.

33:10.447 --> 33:13.985
- Then he should be
happy for you.
— Yeah, but he’s jealous.

33:14.076 --> 33:17.284
He’s always wanted me to fail
so he wouldn’t be the loser.

33:17.371 --> 33:19.862
— How much does he owe you?
— 200 bucks.

33:19.957 --> 33:21.493
But I can’t ask him for it.

33:21.584 --> 33:24.200
He works as a night watchman,
and he barely scrapes by.

33:24.295 --> 33:28.038
So after years of working
to prove him wrong,

33:29.800 --> 33:31.336
I can’t get no satisfaction.

33:31.427 --> 33:34.715
— You found something, Mr. Bray?
- Yes. I did.

33:34.805 --> 33:37.547
Yes, he did,
because he is 29 years old...

33:37.641 --> 33:40.348

of his game.

Happy birthday, my friend.

33:44.356 --> 33:47.098

If it’s not about the case,
I’m not interested.

33:47.193 --> 33:48.774
[ Exhales ]
Right.

33:48.861 --> 33:51.728
Look at the sternum.
I found faint postmortem
microfractures.

33:51.822 --> 33:54.905
They’re consistent with someone
receiving C.P.R. after death.

33:54.992 --> 33:59.031
So the killer attempted
to resuscitate the victim
after the initial attack.

33:59.121 --> 34:04.081
That’s what I thought,
but look at these postmortem
cuts to both femurs.

34:04.168 --> 34:05.783
They’re in line
with the femoral arteries.

34:05.878 --> 34:08.085
So the killer
didn’t show remorse.

34:08.172 --> 34:11.380
He cut the femoral arteries
and then gave
chest compressions...

34:11.467 --> 34:13.298
in order to drain the victim’s blood.

34:13.385 --> 34:16.252
Yeah, to make sure there would be
no arterial spray during dismemberment.

34:16.347 --> 34:18.963
This would have to be someone
with a knowledge of anatomy.

is a surgeon.

Yeah, there’s a problem—
your whereabouts on the night
that your wife was murdered.

34:42.915 --> 34:44.621
I talked to your night nurse.

34:44.708 --> 34:48.246

I would never hurt Melinda.
I loved her.
I’m sure you did,

a tough pill to swallow
when she doesn’t love you back.

35:02.977 --> 35:04.262
We were working through it.
Oh, right.

on you in public? Or—
[ Chuckles ]

35:06.397 --> 35:07.933
This was my favorite one

with other guys
on your front lawn?

No.

The way she was cut,
the way she bled—

the work of a doctor,
a doctor who has no alibi.

ask for that money
from your brother.

The mass spectrometer told you
to butt into my family business?

36:04.830 --> 36:06.331

to collect that 200 bucks.

- Why?
— Because you’ve earned it.

on the victim’s shirt.

Well, I treated the shirt
with fluorescein.

Whoa, it’s flaring orange like the blood,

to her was awful,

remember the bet.

36:56.465 --> 36:57.955
Yeah, but you did.

36:58.050 --> 37:00.041
The reason why you did
is that he challenged
your abilities,

and your brother.

I don’t understand.

it’s because Parker
