In buying the bar;
she never mentioned anything

07:02.890 --> 07:04.423

she lied

She introduced herself
as diane <i>fornell.</i>

10:00.067 --> 10:01.933
Idiot.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.069
I'm satisfied
I'm cleared to talk.

10:04.071 --> 10:06.805
That now I have
to talk to <i>them.</i>

10:06.807 --> 10:08.073
"cleared"?
Mrs. Sterling

10:08.075 --> 10:09.808
Was telling you the truth,
as least partly.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.343
She did go
back to work

10:11.345 --> 10:13.678
For the irs,
just not as an auditor.

10:13.680 --> 10:16.615
She's been promoted
to a gs-11 position

10:16.617 --> 10:17.682
In enforcement.

10:17.684 --> 10:19.117
Which means...

10:19.119 --> 10:22.887
It means that you two aren't
the only ones with a badge.

10:24.757 --> 10:26.091
Wow.

10:26.093 --> 10:28.827
My breakfast burrito
is about to say "hello."

10:28.829 --> 10:31.029
The irs deputy commissioner
called when he heard

10:31.031 --> 10:33.164
That we had...
One of their agents.

10:33.166 --> 10:35.100
Agents?
Wow.

10:35.102 --> 10:39.871
And I was undercover when
you two bumbled into the bar.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.006
Undercover on what?

10:41.008 --> 10:43.008
Big tax-fraud case.

10:43.010 --> 10:44.409
Somebody's stealing
identities,

10:44.411 --> 10:45.977
Filing fake returns
and making off

10:45.979 --> 10:47.846
With a boatload
in fraudulent refund checks.

10:47.848 --> 10:50.015
Costs the irs
billions each year.

10:50.017 --> 10:52.083
We have traced several
identity thefts to the bar.

10:52.085 --> 10:54.119
My plan <i>was</i>
<i>to I.D. The thief</i>

10:54.121 --> 10:55.920
And follow him back
to the ringleader.

10:55.922 --> 10:58.189
I was posing as a buyer
so I could interview

10:58.191 --> 10:59.424
The employees on the dl.

10:59.426 --> 11:01.159
You were posing as mrs. Fornell.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.927
Budget cuts.

11:02.929 --> 11:04.195
A fake I.D.
Is expensive.

11:04.197 --> 11:05.897
I was improvising.
Improvising?!

11:05.899 --> 11:08.033
Your improvising
almost got me killed!

11:08.035 --> 11:11.136
You must have ruffled
the wrong feathers,
agent <i>fornell.</i>

11:11.138 --> 11:15.974
Part of your op
and put a hit out on me!
Sorry?

11:15.976 --> 11:18.143
Sorry?!
Vance:
All right, calm down.

11:18.145 --> 11:20.779
If there was a hit
put out on you, it
means agent sterling

11:20.781 --> 11:23.982
Is getting close, which also
means she's in danger, too.

11:23.984 --> 11:26.084
I want to see
your files.
(laughs): No way!

11:26.086 --> 11:28.253
It wasn't a request.
Oh, I'm so sorry,
let me rephrase that. Go...

11:28.255 --> 11:30.221
Vance:
I said calm down.

11:30.223 --> 11:31.790
Everyone.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.725
You'll have plenty of time
to review her files.

11:33.727 --> 11:36.761
Since this case now spans
three federal agencies,

11:36.763 --> 11:38.897
Your bosses and
I have decided

11:38.899 --> 11:42.000
That the three of you will be
working on this case together.

11:52.712 --> 11:53.945
(whispers):
Here she comes.

11:53.947 --> 11:56.347
Here I go.
Gibbs told us to stay put.

11:56.349 --> 11:58.016
Fornell:
Better you should run
for the hills.

11:58.018 --> 12:00.218
You know, I am not any happier
about this than you are,

12:00.220 --> 12:02.120
So can we please make it
as painless as possible.

12:02.122 --> 12:04.089
So says the queen of pain.

12:04.091 --> 12:06.991
What is going on?
New assignment.

12:06.993 --> 12:08.760
Special agent... Sterling

12:08.762 --> 12:10.228
Will you bring
you up to speed.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.997
Tony (laughing):
What...

12:12.999 --> 12:15.200
Oh, that's-that's...
Very cool.

12:16.435 --> 12:19.003
Diane: Chucky, would you
pull up the irs mainframe,

12:19.005 --> 12:23.208
Directory: Dsterling;
password: Tobias cheap.

12:25.277 --> 12:27.512
As I told frick
and frack already,
somebody is running

12:27.514 --> 12:30.148
A major fraud operation
against the irs,

12:30.150 --> 12:31.416
Stealing hundreds of identities,

12:31.418 --> 12:33.418
Submitting thousands
in fake tax returns.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.120
Diane: We've traced
the identity thefts...

12:35.122 --> 12:36.988
To the navy bar where gibbs
and fornell bumped into you?

12:36.990 --> 12:39.190
And you think someone there was
lifting driver's license info.

12:39.192 --> 12:40.391
Mcgee:
Probably seaman brown.

12:40.393 --> 12:41.893
As a bouncer,
he would've checked

12:41.895 --> 12:44.262
Every I.D. That
came through the door.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.131
You must be very proud, jethro.

12:47.233 --> 12:49.033
Clearly brown
is not the mastermind behind

12:49.035 --> 12:50.969
This operation-- he doesn't
have the accounting chops.

12:50.971 --> 12:53.004
We're looking for somebody else.
Did you run down

12:53.006 --> 12:54.372
The addresses of
the fake tax returns?

12:54.374 --> 12:56.274
Yeah, all p.O. Boxes,
all dead ends.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.076
They keep rotating them out
for new ones.

12:58.078 --> 12:59.944
Where are the perps
cashing the refund checks?

12:59.946 --> 13:02.380
Well, various storefronts
on the opposite side of town.

13:02.382 --> 13:04.149
I've already run down
a whole bunch,

13:04.151 --> 13:05.450
But I got a bunch more.

13:05.452 --> 13:09.220
Gibbs and I are gonna
double-check the p.O. Boxes,

13:09.222 --> 13:10.855
Just in case you
missed something.

13:10.857 --> 13:13.892
And me?
Gibbs:
Check-cashing outlets.

13:13.894 --> 13:16.261
Opposite side of town.

13:18.397 --> 13:20.131
I'll be with you
in a minute.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.867
This is not even close to
the "opposite side of town."

13:22.869 --> 13:26.271
No, but I knew if I
said that, the boys
would want to split up.

13:26.273 --> 13:29.841
I'm not taking a break
from my husband just to
spend it with my exes.

13:29.843 --> 13:31.209
A break?

13:31.211 --> 13:33.278
Are you and victor
having difficulties?

13:33.280 --> 13:36.080
(sighing):
Victor, no.

13:36.082 --> 13:38.049
Me, yes.

13:38.051 --> 13:39.918
I...
Did not mean
to intrude.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.553
Now, don't get me
wrong-- victor,

13:41.555 --> 13:45.023
He's a good man and
he's... He's a great
role model for emily,

13:45.025 --> 13:46.891
But I just...

13:46.893 --> 13:51.596
I'm starting to wonder
if I made a mistake
getting married again.

13:53.533 --> 13:59.237
I settled down so...
Early, and I just went
from marriage to marriage,

13:59.239 --> 14:02.574
You know, and I never
went out and acted crazy,
like all my friends.

14:02.576 --> 14:04.876
Mm. And now you wish to...

14:04.878 --> 14:06.344
Act... Crazy?

14:06.346 --> 14:08.513
Yeah.

14:08.515 --> 14:11.516
I want to go out and
do something wild.

14:11.518 --> 14:14.118
Just let loose for once.

14:14.120 --> 14:15.253
Huh.

14:15.255 --> 14:17.155
That's hard to do
if you're married.

14:18.257 --> 14:19.524
To victor.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.125
Man: Look, guy,
I'm gonna need

14:21.127 --> 14:23.261
Some kind of I.D., okay?

14:23.263 --> 14:24.929
Next.

14:24.931 --> 14:27.165
Or working for the irs.
Hm.

14:28.133 --> 14:30.635
Agent sterling, irs,

14:30.637 --> 14:32.136
Criminal investigations
division.

14:32.138 --> 14:33.638
Agent david, ncis.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.340
I'm not getting
a check-cashing vibe.

14:35.342 --> 14:36.507
We're gonna need
some information.

14:36.509 --> 14:37.508
Ziva: These are
fraudulently

14:37.510 --> 14:38.943
Obtained irs refund checks.

14:38.945 --> 14:41.246
They were cashed here--
we need to know by whom.

14:41.248 --> 14:44.015
Fraudulently obtained?
Hey, that's not my fault.

14:44.017 --> 14:45.416
Well, as the owner,
it's your responsibility

14:45.418 --> 14:47.352
To help us find out
whose fault it is.

14:47.354 --> 14:49.587
All right. If it's
one thing I'm good at,

14:49.589 --> 14:51.189
Is throwing people
under the bus.

14:51.191 --> 14:53.024
Uh...

14:53.026 --> 14:55.460
Yeah, I recognize
the billing code.

14:55.462 --> 14:57.161
Oliver lambert.

14:57.163 --> 14:59.130
An accountant who
comes here once a week,

14:59.132 --> 15:00.932
Cashes checks for his clients.

15:00.934 --> 15:02.300
Do you have his contact info?
Yeah.

15:02.302 --> 15:03.902
I have his contact info,

15:03.904 --> 15:05.637
Records of transactions,

15:05.639 --> 15:07.939
I've even got the guy's
<i>shayna punim</i>

15:07.941 --> 15:09.474
On video, if you'd like.

15:09.476 --> 15:12.210
Just give me a sec.

15:13.579 --> 15:16.347
Abby:
Just like the man said--
once a week, like clockwork,

15:16.349 --> 15:19.317
Lambert cashes about
a dozen refund checks
and then splits.

15:19.319 --> 15:21.185
Looks like we've
got our mastermind.

15:21.187 --> 15:22.921
An accountant should
certainly have the chops

15:22.923 --> 15:24.622
To scam the irs.

15:24.624 --> 15:26.391
He and seaman brown must've
been working together.

15:26.393 --> 15:28.059
No word on lambert's bolo, boss.

15:28.061 --> 15:29.994
He wasn't at his
home or office,

15:29.996 --> 15:32.330
And his cell phone is off,
but we did get his computer.

15:32.332 --> 15:34.365
Abby:
Have you checked race tracks?
'cause I notice

15:34.367 --> 15:37.368
Every single time lambert
shows up, he has the same

15:37.370 --> 15:39.270
Piece of paper folded up
in his back pocket.

15:39.272 --> 15:43.074
He likes the horses.
I'll expand
the bolo,

15:43.076 --> 15:45.610
But I don't think he's
hanging around-- he just
emptied his bank account.

15:45.612 --> 15:48.279
Nah, he's running.
Must have found out
the feds are after him.

15:48.281 --> 15:52.550
He's probably the one
who tried to have you
killed, remember?

15:52.552 --> 15:56.354
Speaking of which, diane is
probably on his hit list, too.

15:56.356 --> 15:58.289
It's getting late.
With lambert on the loose,

15:58.291 --> 16:01.960
Sleep at your house tonight.
I'll talk to you later.

16:01.962 --> 16:04.028
No, you're right,
she shouldn't be alone,

16:04.030 --> 16:05.363
But since you
married her last,

16:05.365 --> 16:06.597
I think that
means your place.

16:06.599 --> 16:08.066
Abby:
This is gonna be good.

16:08.068 --> 16:09.968
Fornell:
I've got no clean sheets.

16:09.970 --> 16:12.637
My heater's broken.
I've got toxic black mold
in my kitchen.

16:12.639 --> 16:16.607
Since I know the one place
she's definitely <i>not</i> staying.

16:26.485 --> 16:28.219
(sighs)

16:28.221 --> 16:29.721
Oh, this is
ridiculous.

16:29.723 --> 16:31.723
Why can't I just
stay at my place?

16:31.725 --> 16:33.591
They can post an agent
outside my door.

16:33.593 --> 16:36.527
'cause the best way
to protect you is
to make you hard to find.

16:36.529 --> 16:39.464
Well, then trust me,
we're good, because no one's
gonna come looking for me

16:39.466 --> 16:40.765
This close to
where you shower.

16:40.767 --> 16:43.234
Look, I'll take the couch;
you can have the bed.

16:43.236 --> 16:45.269
I would rather stand;
I'll take the couch.

16:45.271 --> 16:46.671
Whatever.

16:46.673 --> 16:49.607
(sighs)
you don't have to be
so rude about it.

16:50.576 --> 16:53.011
Me? Being rude?

16:53.013 --> 16:54.445
This coming
from the woman
who spent

16:54.447 --> 16:56.681
The entire car ride over here
telling me I had

16:56.683 --> 16:58.349
The worst possible haircut
for my face.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.351
I was trying to be helpful.
Oh, were you also being helpful

17:00.353 --> 17:02.186
When you told me my elbows
weren't pointy enough?

17:02.188 --> 17:03.287
What does that even mean?

17:03.289 --> 17:04.689
Cut me slack, chucky.

17:04.691 --> 17:07.058
(groans) I almost had
my daughter's father killed,

17:07.060 --> 17:09.560
My husband wants to leave me,
and now I find out

17:09.562 --> 17:11.362
My own life might be in danger?

17:11.364 --> 17:14.365
The rumor I heard was, you
were thinking of leaving victor.

17:14.367 --> 17:17.635
It's none of your business;
I don't want to talk about it.

17:17.637 --> 17:21.439
Trust me, fine by me.
Oh, the thing is that victor,
he used to tell me

17:21.441 --> 17:23.741
Every day I was the most
beautiful woman in the world,

17:23.743 --> 17:27.478
And now he...
Doesn't say that anymore.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.680
So has <i>he</i> changed...

17:29.682 --> 17:32.583
Or have I?

17:32.585 --> 17:34.652
What do you think?

17:36.088 --> 17:37.622
Excuse me?

17:37.624 --> 17:40.458
Well, it's a simple question.

17:40.460 --> 17:43.061
You're an attractive man--
I-I want to know,

17:43.063 --> 17:45.663
Do you find me attractive?

17:47.199 --> 17:48.599
Um...

17:48.601 --> 17:50.435
You mean physically, or...?
I mean, when it

17:50.437 --> 17:52.737
Came to jethro, you know,
who could blame me for that?

17:52.739 --> 17:54.439
And he was still in love
with his dead wife,

17:54.441 --> 17:57.275
And I was just another
in a string of failed marriages,

17:57.277 --> 17:59.077
But then tobias and...

17:59.079 --> 18:01.179
And now maybe victor...

18:01.181 --> 18:04.515
You're worried something
might be wrong with you?

18:04.517 --> 18:06.684
Yeah.

18:11.423 --> 18:14.325
Look, you're... Attractive.

18:16.161 --> 18:17.728
At least on the outside.

18:18.697 --> 18:20.231
(scoffs quietly)

18:20.233 --> 18:22.133
I'll take it.

18:22.135 --> 18:23.534
(relieved sigh)
I'm sorry.

18:23.536 --> 18:25.570
I didn't mean to unload
on you like that.

18:25.572 --> 18:27.538
(sighs):
I just... You know,

18:27.540 --> 18:30.341
I guess I...
What I really need...

18:30.343 --> 18:31.843
To be alone?
No.

18:31.845 --> 18:33.744
Yeah, well,

18:33.746 --> 18:35.680
Believe it or not, I...

18:35.682 --> 18:37.715
I think I just need a hug.

18:42.387 --> 18:44.422
I'm not hugging you.

18:44.424 --> 18:47.191
Why not?
Uh, it's not gonna happen.

18:47.193 --> 18:49.527
You come over here and hug me
right now, damn it!
No way.

18:49.529 --> 18:51.195
What kind of man are you?

18:51.197 --> 18:53.131
Here you have
a depressed,

18:53.133 --> 18:55.266
Miserable coworker
standing right in front of you,

18:55.268 --> 18:57.401
You can't even give her
a simple hug?

18:58.670 --> 19:00.338
(sighs)

19:00.340 --> 19:03.374
Your parents failed.

19:11.617 --> 19:13.551
(quiet sigh)

19:24.830 --> 19:26.297
(sobs)

19:28.500 --> 19:30.334
(diane sobbing quietly)

19:34.273 --> 19:36.641
(birds chirping)

19:40.913 --> 19:43.948
(horn honking in distance)

19:43.950 --> 19:47.785
(door opens)
fornell: Hey, gibbs,
what's taking so long?

19:47.787 --> 19:49.187
Come on, people!

19:49.189 --> 19:51.722
Chop, chop!

19:51.724 --> 19:54.458
Holy fourth of July
weenie roast!

19:54.460 --> 19:55.726
What the hell am I looking at?!

19:55.728 --> 19:59.330
(moaning softly)

19:59.332 --> 20:01.265
Mm?

20:01.267 --> 20:03.801
Whoa! Boss, this is
not what it looks like.

20:03.803 --> 20:05.870
What does it look like?
Diane:
W-we were talking

20:05.872 --> 20:07.972
And, you know,
we fell asleep on the couch.

20:07.974 --> 20:09.840
Intertwined like
horny rabbits!

20:09.842 --> 20:12.543
What's it to you?
So what if something happened?

20:12.545 --> 20:14.879
No, no, nothing happened.
<i>We're</i> not married anymore.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.681
No, but <i>you</i> are!
Why are you...

20:16.683 --> 20:18.683
Gibbs:
Enough! We need to all

20:18.685 --> 20:20.651
Put a pin in it.

20:21.753 --> 20:24.522
Abby's got a lead
on an accountant.

20:36.501 --> 20:39.637
Hey, boss.
Abby found an e-mail
on the accountant's pc

20:39.639 --> 20:42.573
About an overdue payment
on this rental house.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.308
That's the search warrant.

20:44.310 --> 20:49.513
We thought it was
best for the op for
her to take a shower.

20:49.515 --> 20:51.882
I mean head back to
ncis to assist abby.

20:51.884 --> 20:53.417
I told you,
nothing happened.

20:53.419 --> 20:55.686
Rental house?
Yeah, lambert went
out of his way

20:55.688 --> 20:57.521
To hide his connection
to the place.

20:57.523 --> 20:58.990
Fornell:
So, let's see
what's inside.

20:58.992 --> 21:00.391
Mcgee...

21:00.393 --> 21:02.526
You and I
take the back.

21:02.528 --> 21:05.329
No. I'll go with you.

21:06.832 --> 21:08.866
What was that all about?

21:08.868 --> 21:11.435
I don't want
to talk about it.
Come on, spill it.

21:11.437 --> 21:13.304
(knocking)

21:13.306 --> 21:16.374
Ncis! Open up, we got
a search warrant!

21:16.376 --> 21:18.309
And an agent
keeping secrets!

21:18.311 --> 21:20.044
Shut up and
open it, tony.
Relax, mcgee.

21:33.825 --> 21:36.427
(low groan)

21:36.429 --> 21:39.630
Whew! It's colder in here
than it is outside.

21:48.073 --> 21:50.441
Fishy.
(chuckles)

21:55.414 --> 21:57.548
Right. Of course.

21:58.550 --> 21:59.884
The accountant
was renting a home

21:59.886 --> 22:01.519
For his frozen fish collection.

22:04.956 --> 22:07.024
There's nobody home.

22:07.793 --> 22:09.860
Nobody living,
at least.

22:15.967 --> 22:17.835
Fornell:
Is that the drunk guy

22:17.837 --> 22:19.904
From the bar?

22:27.779 --> 22:30.514
Okay... If you don't
tell me what happened

22:30.516 --> 22:33.651
Between you and diane,
then I'm just gonna have
to believe the rumors.

22:33.653 --> 22:36.520
Tony, how many times
do I have to tell you?
Nothing happened.

22:36.522 --> 22:38.055
Wait. What rumors?
The kind

22:38.057 --> 22:39.924
That would make
a grown man blush, mcgee.

22:39.926 --> 22:42.360
Even our latest victim
turned a slight shade of pink

22:42.362 --> 22:43.427
When he heard one.

22:43.429 --> 22:44.795
And he's <i>dead.</i>
<i>Oh, please</i>

22:44.797 --> 22:46.564
Don't tell me everyone here
is talking about this.

22:46.566 --> 22:48.599
We're working an irs fraud case.

22:48.601 --> 22:50.668
You sleeping <i>alone</i>
<i>is more interesting.</i>

22:50.670 --> 22:52.536
Much less you sleeping with...
I didn't.

22:52.538 --> 22:54.672
We didn't.
Look, we found

22:54.674 --> 22:56.474
A house filled with nothing
but frozen fish.

22:56.476 --> 22:57.842
That's not more
interesting to you?

22:58.810 --> 23:00.544
No.
Diane and I

23:00.546 --> 23:03.147
Feel asleep on the couch,
talking, that's all.

23:03.149 --> 23:05.950
Well, given agent gibbs'
and fornell's propensity
for violence,

23:05.952 --> 23:08.686
That's the story I would
stick to if I were you.

23:08.688 --> 23:10.821
Ducky:
All right, much as I find

23:10.823 --> 23:13.824
Your sexual escapades riveting,

23:13.826 --> 23:16.026
The story that I'm
really interested in

23:16.028 --> 23:17.762
Belongs to
this man.

23:17.764 --> 23:20.598
Go ahead, mccasanova,
change the subject.

23:20.600 --> 23:23.134
His name is viggo kiln.

23:23.136 --> 23:25.736
From what we can tell from the
files found at his home, he was

23:25.738 --> 23:27.138
Working with seaman brown
and the accountant.

23:27.140 --> 23:29.440
Tony:
Viggo provided
the assist, playing

23:29.442 --> 23:31.108
The lovable barfly
chatting people up,

23:31.110 --> 23:32.743
Getting the details
about their lives

23:32.745 --> 23:34.645
So that they could steal
their identities.

23:34.647 --> 23:36.514
Once the accountant
had enough info,

23:36.516 --> 23:39.116
He'd file a fake return,
then collect the refund check.

23:39.118 --> 23:41.419
Yeah, well, it seems
our barfly's services

23:41.421 --> 23:42.887
Are no longer required.

23:42.889 --> 23:45.856
We extracted two bullets
from his brain cavity.

23:45.858 --> 23:47.725
Execution style.

23:47.727 --> 23:50.895
Abby ran ballistics--
two .22-caliber low-loads.

23:50.897 --> 23:52.630
She also
matched them

23:52.632 --> 23:54.999
To a gun registered
to an oliver lambert.

23:55.001 --> 23:57.601
The missing accountant.

23:57.603 --> 23:59.136
Well, maybe the two
had a falling-out.

23:59.138 --> 24:01.071
Maybe lambert knew
we were on to him,

24:01.073 --> 24:02.840
Was looking to
tie up loose ends?

24:02.842 --> 24:06.844
Well, neither of which explains
the presence of the frozen fish.

24:06.846 --> 24:10.214
Do you have a theory
as to its significance?

24:10.216 --> 24:12.616
Diane: <i>I think we have</i>
<i>a good working theory</i>

24:12.618 --> 24:14.485
On the fish-- I just want
to dig a little deeper

24:14.487 --> 24:16.554
Before we take it to the boys,
just in case we're wrong.

24:16.556 --> 24:17.988
I think we have enough
to go to gibbs.

24:17.990 --> 24:19.757
Yeah, gibbs maybe, but fornell?

24:19.759 --> 24:20.858
The man takes
too much pleasure

24:20.860 --> 24:22.059
In proving me wrong.
The last thing

24:22.061 --> 24:23.661
I want to do
is make <i>him</i> happy.

24:25.163 --> 24:26.764
So...

24:26.766 --> 24:29.233
Do anything, um...

24:29.235 --> 24:31.535
Crazy lately?

24:31.537 --> 24:32.837
Huh? What do you mean?

24:32.839 --> 24:35.239
Well, you told me yesterday
you wanted to go out

24:35.241 --> 24:38.008
And do something crazy,
so I was just wondering if...

24:38.010 --> 24:39.610
You did.

24:39.612 --> 24:41.045
Diane:
Nailed it! I found a clue.

24:41.047 --> 24:43.547
This is a shipping manifest
for a place called

24:43.549 --> 24:44.782
Donggang in china.

24:44.784 --> 24:46.183
You pull it up?

24:48.186 --> 24:50.154
And it's right
on the border with...

24:50.156 --> 24:52.189
North korea-- that is
the third in a row.

24:52.191 --> 24:53.657
Too many to be
a coincidence.

24:53.659 --> 24:54.792
Fornell:
And nobody likes those,

24:54.794 --> 24:56.961
Especially when
they involve north korea

24:56.963 --> 24:58.062
Or couches.

24:58.064 --> 24:59.530
Gibbs:
What do we got?

24:59.532 --> 25:00.965
We were going over
the shipping manifests

25:00.967 --> 25:03.634
We found in the fish house,
and we noticed a pattern.

25:03.636 --> 25:06.704
All of the fish are
being exported to small
fishing villages,

25:06.706 --> 25:08.806
All on the borders of some
very interesting countries.

25:08.808 --> 25:11.942
Fornell:
Syria, north korea and iran.

25:11.944 --> 25:13.711
The axis of evil 2.0.

25:13.713 --> 25:15.212
Well, that
doesn't look good.

25:15.214 --> 25:17.815
And what's with sending
fish to fishing villages?

25:17.817 --> 25:19.216
Doesn't it usually work
the other way around?

25:19.218 --> 25:20.551
Well, we're not sure
what that means.

25:20.553 --> 25:22.520
I know a customs agent
I could talk to,

25:22.522 --> 25:24.655
See if he'll issue a bolo
on similar shipments.

25:24.657 --> 25:25.823
That might
shed some light.

25:25.825 --> 25:26.957
Tobias, go back to the fbi,

25:26.959 --> 25:29.059
Do the same thing.
Jethro, mtac.

25:29.061 --> 25:30.728
See if there's
any new intel on syria,

25:30.730 --> 25:33.297
North korea or iran.

25:37.002 --> 25:38.736
Did she just give us orders?

25:38.738 --> 25:39.737
Yeah.

25:39.739 --> 25:41.772
But they're good ones.

25:41.774 --> 25:43.173
I know!

25:50.582 --> 25:52.249
Where'd everybody go?

25:52.251 --> 25:54.952
To find out why frozen fish
are being sent to border towns

25:54.954 --> 25:56.120
Of our political adversaries.

25:56.122 --> 25:57.988
That's weird.

25:57.990 --> 25:59.123
But what's weirder

25:59.125 --> 26:01.191
Is that it's not just fish.

26:02.761 --> 26:05.563
The official fish name
is <i>thunnus alalunga,</i>

26:05.565 --> 26:07.965
Otherwise known
as albacore tuna.

26:07.967 --> 26:10.634
And when I decided to
take a closer look...

26:10.636 --> 26:12.336
Adson's retractor.

26:13.738 --> 26:14.972
(whispers):
That one.
Oh.

26:15.941 --> 26:19.610
...I found something
very odd.

26:19.612 --> 26:21.278
Forceps.

26:27.285 --> 26:29.053
Is that a cell phone?
Yep.

26:29.055 --> 26:31.155
There's a cell phone
inside the fish?

26:31.157 --> 26:32.623
There is a
cell phone...

26:32.625 --> 26:34.658
Inside...

26:34.660 --> 26:36.827
Every fish.
Is there anything on them?

26:36.829 --> 26:38.262
So far,
they're all unregistered,

26:38.264 --> 26:41.865
But I noticed that their
imei numbers indicate

26:41.867 --> 26:44.201
They all came from the
same manufacturing batch.

26:44.203 --> 26:46.904
I was able to do a wideband
search of the batch number,

26:46.906 --> 26:48.906
And I found an active cell
in the group.

26:48.908 --> 26:51.942
Someone with a fish phone
made a phone call.

26:51.944 --> 26:54.244
To...?
To... Our missing accountant's

26:54.246 --> 26:59.249
I'm guessing from the
length of the call that
they knew the password.

26:59.251 --> 27:02.052
It may be him.
It's a good bet.

27:02.054 --> 27:05.289
There was nothing useful
in the voice mail, but...

27:05.291 --> 27:06.991
(beeping)

27:09.628 --> 27:12.630
...I got the location
of the caller.

27:13.398 --> 27:15.733
Ziva:
No sign of lambert.

27:15.735 --> 27:18.202
Same here.
And I'm getting tired.

27:19.237 --> 27:21.739
Didn't get enough sleep
last night, huh?

27:24.843 --> 27:26.043
This is a wild-goose chase.

27:26.045 --> 27:27.811
Guy made one
phone call from here.

27:27.813 --> 27:29.380
He's long gone.
Well, you can always

27:29.382 --> 27:33.217
Go back to ncis,
wait for diane to
come back from ice.

27:33.219 --> 27:35.352
But we should leave
no stone unturned.

27:35.354 --> 27:38.355
Speaking of the
spawn of unholiness,

27:38.357 --> 27:41.825
I did some checking with a
buddy of mine at the irs--

27:41.827 --> 27:43.327
Know what I heard?
That's she's

27:43.329 --> 27:47.064
Not leaving victor,
it's victor thinking
about leaving her?

27:47.066 --> 27:50.100
How did you know that?
Can't say I'm surprised, either.

27:50.102 --> 27:51.869
You ever notice how
she never gets sick?

27:51.871 --> 27:56.106
But this victor thing
explains something
else that I heard,

27:56.108 --> 27:59.243
Something that I suspect
you <i>don't</i> know, since you
don't look nauseous.

27:59.245 --> 28:01.712
I don't get nauseous.

28:01.714 --> 28:02.680
We'll see about that.

28:02.682 --> 28:04.381
Mm.
Ask yourself
something.

28:04.383 --> 28:05.949
What are the odds

28:05.951 --> 28:09.286
Of diane being assigned a case
in your jurisdiction?

28:10.221 --> 28:13.123
Pretty good. She <i>was.</i>

28:13.125 --> 28:15.726
No. She wasn't.

28:15.728 --> 28:17.394
She was originally

28:17.396 --> 28:20.364
Working a different jurisdiction
on this tax fraud thing.

28:20.366 --> 28:24.134
When the identity theft
was traced to a navy bar,

28:24.136 --> 28:26.870
Diane asked to be transferred
to your jurisdiction.

28:26.872 --> 28:28.972
That's right.

28:28.974 --> 28:32.743
I can hear those stomach
acids gurgling from here.

28:32.745 --> 28:34.912
Her father was navy.

28:34.914 --> 28:36.914
I worked for ncis.

28:36.916 --> 28:39.983
Diane, she's just
more familiar with the military.

28:39.985 --> 28:42.052
You keep telling
yourself that.

28:42.054 --> 28:44.088
Because you know
what I think?

28:44.090 --> 28:45.989
I think she asked
for a transfer

28:45.991 --> 28:48.225
Because she was hoping
to run into you.

28:49.994 --> 28:52.229
Looks like mcgee has got
a little competition.

28:52.231 --> 28:55.132
Boss, it's lambert,
on your nine.

28:58.403 --> 29:00.437
Gibbs: Okay,
here we go.

29:00.439 --> 29:02.005
Let's move.

29:07.812 --> 29:09.146
Oliver lambert?

29:10.115 --> 29:11.849
Yes?

29:11.851 --> 29:12.983
Ncis.

29:14.352 --> 29:16.887
Fbi.
Need you to come with us.

29:16.889 --> 29:19.056
Fornell:
Would you take your hands out
of your pockets, please, sir?

29:24.462 --> 29:27.765
The money I took from the irs
wasn't for me.

29:27.767 --> 29:30.467
I'd love to hear about
that; I'd love to see
your hands even more.

29:32.403 --> 29:34.872
Put your hands
where we can see 'em.

29:38.777 --> 29:41.378
I was just trying
to set things right.

29:41.380 --> 29:43.514
Sudden moves are
not your friend.

29:43.516 --> 29:45.215
But I'll...

29:45.217 --> 29:47.918
Tell you everything now.

29:47.920 --> 29:49.286
I gave them

29:49.288 --> 29:51.021
This week's payment,
but they're worried.

29:51.023 --> 29:54.258
I... I think they
might try and kill me.

29:54.260 --> 29:55.192
Hands!

30:19.150 --> 30:21.418
Ducky confirmed lambert died
of multiple stab wounds.

30:21.420 --> 30:23.253
Ziva:
Fornell is still
taking statements,

30:23.255 --> 30:25.923
But witnesses report
seeing lambert in a car

30:25.925 --> 30:29.159
With either a man, a woman
or nobody, depending
on who you talk to.

30:29.161 --> 30:31.328
Lambert said the money
he took wasn't for him.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.530
Tony: Sounded like he was in the
hole to somebody for something.

30:33.532 --> 30:35.132
Mcgee:
One of his clients.

30:35.134 --> 30:37.134
Abby found this thumb drive
in his wallet.

30:37.136 --> 30:39.603
Looks like lambert was gathering
evidence to cop a plea.

30:39.605 --> 30:42.072
His files show that
he embezzled from
one of his clients,

30:42.074 --> 30:43.273
Then blew the money
at the track--

30:43.275 --> 30:45.142
And he had a statement
for the d.A.

30:45.144 --> 30:46.944
It says that the client
threatened to kill him

30:46.946 --> 30:48.378
If he didn't repay
the money he took,

30:48.380 --> 30:50.113
Then forced him
to steal from the irs.

30:50.115 --> 30:52.850
And then some.
Client must be a scary guy.

30:52.852 --> 30:54.985
You got a name?
No. Lambert left it out.

30:54.987 --> 30:56.420
Well, maybe he's holding it
for his plea bargain.

30:56.422 --> 30:58.956
Okay. That was diane;
she's on her way.

30:58.958 --> 31:00.290
Her fish bolo came back.

31:00.292 --> 31:02.259
Customs found
another container

31:02.261 --> 31:03.527
Headed for donggang, china.

31:03.529 --> 31:05.262
More cell phones?
No.

31:05.264 --> 31:06.897
This time they
found dvd's

31:06.899 --> 31:08.398
And luxury soaps
inside the fish.

31:08.400 --> 31:10.434
Client's a smuggler.
Put up maps.

31:10.436 --> 31:13.437
Gibbs: There's u.N. Sanctions
on all these countries.

31:13.439 --> 31:15.038
Which means
no western cell phones,

31:15.040 --> 31:17.608
<i>Dora</i> dvd's
or lavender-scented bath soap.

31:17.610 --> 31:20.911
And I thought the middle class
here was having a hard time.

31:20.913 --> 31:22.646
Diane's contact thinks
the smuggler is using

31:22.648 --> 31:25.182
Local fishermen to get the goods
across sanctioned borders.

31:25.184 --> 31:29.286
Gibbs: Was diane able
to trace the shipment?
It was a dead-end.

31:29.288 --> 31:31.188
Shipper's info
was all fake.

31:31.190 --> 31:33.090
Well, it's a good thing
you can't fake dna.

31:33.092 --> 31:35.459
Because I've got some.

31:35.461 --> 31:37.027
So, I ran dna on our tuna

31:37.029 --> 31:38.929
To try to figure out
where it came from.

31:38.931 --> 31:41.164
Sadly, for those of
us investigating
fish-based crime,

31:41.166 --> 31:43.233
There's no national database
to compare it to.

31:43.235 --> 31:44.501
But...?

31:44.503 --> 31:46.603
My fifth favorite word.

31:46.605 --> 31:49.940
<i>But...</i> I sent jimmy to
pick up albacore tuna

31:49.942 --> 31:52.342
From every supermarket
between here and alexandria,

31:52.344 --> 31:54.645
And I got a familial match.

31:55.613 --> 31:57.214
Our smuggle fish
definitely came

31:57.216 --> 31:59.216
From the same catch
as our sample

31:59.218 --> 32:01.485
From f&g grocery.

32:01.487 --> 32:04.288
And they buy their albacore
from a man named...

32:04.290 --> 32:06.523
Diane: Avis boyle.
He owns a small

32:06.525 --> 32:08.558
Fish distributor that serves
the tristate area.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.427
And according
to his tax return,

32:10.429 --> 32:12.496
He was a client
of oliver lambert.

32:12.498 --> 32:14.031
He's our smuggler.

32:14.966 --> 32:16.566
Abby already briefed me.

32:16.568 --> 32:18.068
First?

32:18.070 --> 32:19.336
Let it go.

32:19.338 --> 32:21.338
We have to figure out
our next move.

32:21.340 --> 32:23.106
Our next move is
arresting boyle.

32:23.108 --> 32:25.375
For what?
That's right, woodchuck.

32:25.377 --> 32:26.710
You can't tie him
to lambert's murder.

32:26.712 --> 32:28.312
The books don't mention
boyle by name.

32:28.314 --> 32:29.513
And the fish dna...

32:29.515 --> 32:31.348
It's circumstantial.
Now,

32:31.350 --> 32:33.617
The irs has had their eye
on this guy for some time,

32:33.619 --> 32:35.419
For undeclared earnings,
but they could never prove it.

32:35.421 --> 32:37.187
But you got an idea.

32:37.189 --> 32:39.156
And it's a good one.
Why do I feel

32:39.158 --> 32:41.325
Like I'm being set up?
Not you. Boyle.

32:41.327 --> 32:43.060
So his accountant
was laundering his money.

32:43.062 --> 32:44.227
But now the
accountant's dead.

32:44.229 --> 32:46.029
Well, boyle's
gonna need a new one.

32:46.031 --> 32:47.564
No, forget it.

32:47.566 --> 32:49.266
Can I finish?
We don't have a lot of time.

32:49.268 --> 32:52.569
He hires somebody else
to start doing his books.

32:52.571 --> 32:58.008
You can wire me and
then bust him when he
incriminates himself.

32:58.010 --> 33:00.310
It's a good plan,
and you know it.

33:00.312 --> 33:03.380
You're not going in alone;
I'm coming with you.

33:03.382 --> 33:07.384
You might regret that when you
find out where boyle is today.

33:09.454 --> 33:12.522
♪
(indistinct chatter)

33:15.360 --> 33:17.227
Oh, I regret this.

Fornell (over radio):
I am so glad

<i>This is you and not me.</i>

33:24.169 --> 33:26.303
Ziva:
And we're getting

33:26.305 --> 33:28.772
A solid image from the camera
on diane's brooch.

33:28.774 --> 33:31.441
Which looks much better

33:31.443 --> 33:33.643
On you than it did
on me, by the way.

33:33.645 --> 33:35.379
Mcgee:
Just be careful

33:35.381 --> 33:37.147
Not to knock it loose.

33:37.149 --> 33:38.382
Oh, it's not going anywhere.

33:38.384 --> 33:40.450
You spent more
than enough time

33:40.452 --> 33:44.187
Attaching it to my
ex-wife's... Bosom.

33:44.189 --> 33:46.723
Way too much time,
if you ask me.

33:46.725 --> 33:48.291
I guess he didn't get
enough last night.

33:48.293 --> 33:49.760
What?

33:51.329 --> 33:52.562
No, I...

33:52.564 --> 33:54.064

33:54.732 --> 33:56.700
Diane, the joke is over!

I'm just having
a little fun.

33:58.337 --> 34:00.504
♪

34:00.506 --> 34:04.174
So, shall we
find our man?

34:05.810 --> 34:08.278
Do you remember how
you proposed to me?

34:10.314 --> 34:12.149
Yeah, I didn't think so.

34:12.151 --> 34:14.217
Don't feel too bad;
I don't, either.

34:16.621 --> 34:18.822
"didn't get enough

34:18.824 --> 34:20.490
Last night."
that's what she said.

34:21.727 --> 34:23.827
That you did get something.

That was the most boring
best-man speech I've ever heard.

he told me to keep it clean.

There's been a misunderstanding.

I have no idea
what you're talking about.
No.

Of ill-gotten operating
gross revenues

35:37.269 --> 35:40.537
That you're gonna
have to shelter from any

<i>Unless</i> you want to be
incredibly stupid

35:43.208 --> 35:45.208

35:45.210 --> 35:46.776
Now you're listening, huh?

35:46.778 --> 35:49.246
I used to work
with lambert.

35:49.248 --> 35:51.281
I did all that
jackass's grunt work.

35:51.283 --> 35:52.782
And when I say all,

35:52.784 --> 35:54.284
I mean all.

He didn't mention

36:50.676 --> 36:53.476

Walk.

Aw...

Yes.

<i>We were wrong.</i>

38:26.938 --> 38:29.005
Boyle wasn't

He was just one
of four distributors

38:30.742 --> 38:32.475
That was involved
in the smuggling operation.

the big guy.

38:34.012 --> 38:36.613

the entire op

38:36.615 --> 38:38.715

cashing franchise.

38:38.717 --> 38:40.417
Lot of cash
moving in and out.

38:40.419 --> 38:41.918
Easy for him
to launder the money.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.887

hit out on the fornells?

38:43.889 --> 38:45.055
It's sterling, remember?

38:45.057 --> 38:46.323

39:00.038 --> 39:02.372
I've had root canals

39:02.374 --> 39:04.374
As a matter of fact,
we were discussing

39:04.376 --> 39:06.009
The possibility of...

39:06.011 --> 39:09.045
Making the three of you
a permanent working group

39:09.047 --> 39:11.948

no.

39:39.578 --> 39:42.545

But, you know, since
you caught me...

39:46.418 --> 39:48.485

I could use a drink.

39:51.722 --> 39:53.790

39:58.963 --> 40:00.964
That was a
sweet proposal.

40:04.535 --> 40:06.936
Yeah. Well...

40:06.938 --> 40:09.072
I thought you didn't, either.

40:09.074 --> 40:11.508

Uh, last time I was here,
I accused you of something.

40:21.019 --> 40:23.720
I said, um...

40:23.722 --> 40:26.589
That you never
loved me, and...

40:26.591 --> 40:28.792
You didn't correct me.

40:31.595 --> 40:33.696
But I think I was wrong.

40:37.668 --> 40:39.035
(laughs softly)

40:39.037 --> 40:41.171
Not that you're gonna
do anything about it

40:41.173 --> 40:42.939

40:56.721 --> 40:59.589
Okay, what do I have to
give victor a break for?

40:59.591 --> 41:03.493
For being him...

41:03.495 --> 41:05.829
And not somebody else.

41:08.199 --> 41:11.167
You got to let it go, diane.

41:14.472 --> 41:16.473
I couldn't...

41:16.475 --> 41:19.843
And I drove everybody away.

41:23.581 --> 41:25.181
And...

41:25.183 --> 41:28.117
The last thing
you want to be is me.

41:32.623 --> 41:34.757
(whispers):
You're not so bad.

41:34.759 --> 41:35.925
(laughs softly)

41:41.665 --> 41:45.168
But I hear you.

41:45.170 --> 41:47.670
Unfortunately, it might
be a little too late.

41:47.672 --> 41:49.138
No, it's not.

41:49.140 --> 41:50.540
(laughs)

41:50.542 --> 41:52.208
How do you know
everything?

41:52.210 --> 41:54.077
I don't.

41:54.079 --> 41:56.012
I don't. I...

41:56.014 --> 41:58.915
I just learned
how to listen.

42:03.621 --> 42:06.923
Well, what about you?

42:06.925 --> 42:10.827
Don't you think there's
somebody out there for you?

42:10.829 --> 42:14.697
Or are you destined to spend
the rest of your days alone?

42:20.838 --> 42:22.906
I'm not alone.
