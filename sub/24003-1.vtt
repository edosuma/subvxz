02:07.002 --> 02:08.663
Mr. Donovan?

02:16.261 --> 02:18.048
When I first came here,

02:18.180 --> 02:21.264
I thought,
"This is more peaceful than London."

02:23.060 --> 02:24.676
Idyllic.

02:25.520 --> 02:26.761
Just beautiful.

02:29.024 --> 02:30.105
It's your move.

02:31.860 --> 02:32.941
I'm making it.

02:38.033 --> 02:39.524
Then I realised...

02:40.702 --> 02:44.571
All this, it's not a great view.

02:46.291 --> 02:48.533
It's just sea and sky.

02:49.544 --> 02:53.879
What I thought was paradise
was actually a prison.

02:56.468 --> 02:58.551
I hadn't escaped London.

02:59.721 --> 03:00.837
I'd been exiled.

03:04.059 --> 03:05.220
I've taken your queen.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.889
And I was sad to discover

03:12.442 --> 03:15.935
there were also people here
wanting to bring me down.

03:21.827 --> 03:23.739
Your move, Evan.

03:27.874 --> 03:29.365
Why so cheerful?

03:31.128 --> 03:33.211
That's... That's my affair.

03:33.296 --> 03:36.414
And speaking of affairs, how old is she?

03:38.802 --> 03:40.509
Twenty.

03:40.595 --> 03:42.052
Fourteen.

03:42.139 --> 03:45.507
Yeah. Yeah, she's young, but she's

03:45.600 --> 03:47.136
very mature, you know.

03:47.853 --> 03:50.687
- It's not what you think.
- She's a child.

03:55.110 --> 03:56.476
Do they know?

03:57.863 --> 03:59.149
Your handler?

04:00.866 --> 04:05.827
Or is this all part of your cover story
to make you more believable to me?

04:12.294 --> 04:13.876
How long have you known?

04:14.254 --> 04:15.711
Long enough.

04:15.839 --> 04:20.083
Can you imagine what I've been through
to get close to you bastards?

04:20.218 --> 04:22.050
How long it's taken?

04:22.137 --> 04:23.753
Well, you've wasted your time.

04:23.847 --> 04:27.431
No, not if I get the great Donovan.

04:29.311 --> 04:31.303
Have you gathered enough evidence yet?

04:31.438 --> 04:32.770
Fuck evidence.

04:34.816 --> 04:36.899
I'm just going to kill you.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.152
What about the paperwork?

04:40.238 --> 04:43.447
Nah. You know they've
tried that route before.

04:44.659 --> 04:48.744
So you would rather kill me in cold blood
than do things legally?

04:48.830 --> 04:50.116
I hate paperwork.

04:54.002 --> 04:56.119
You deserve everything coming to you.

05:29.788 --> 05:31.450
Andy Hathaway.

05:34.751 --> 05:36.492
You've been a naughty boy.

05:38.088 --> 05:40.580
A very naughty boy.

05:41.049 --> 05:42.415
Doyle?

05:43.134 --> 05:45.626
Doyle, what the fu...

05:45.720 --> 05:47.382
Why are you calling me Andy?

05:47.472 --> 05:50.636
Yeah. Yeah, we all thought
you were called Doug.

05:50.725 --> 05:52.887
You even look like a Doug.

05:52.978 --> 05:55.470
But you've only been
pretending to be one of us.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.682
What the fuck are you talking about?
Where's Donovan?

05:59.776 --> 06:04.020
Mr Donovan has asked me
to have a wee chat with you.

06:04.739 --> 06:07.197
Doyle, look,

06:07.284 --> 06:10.197
whatever the fuck you think I've done,
just fucking tell me,

06:10.287 --> 06:14.827
'cause there'll be...
There'll be a fucking explanation, right?

06:14.958 --> 06:17.291
Do you ever see what one of these
can do to a man, Andy?

06:17.377 --> 06:19.869
I've not done it myself, not yet.

06:19.963 --> 06:24.503
But I've seen fingers,
toes, nails pulled out.

06:24.843 --> 06:27.051
I've even seen someone pull an eye out
with one of these, Andy.

06:27.137 --> 06:30.346
All right, stop fucking calling me Andy.
My name's not Andy.

06:30.473 --> 06:34.012
Do you remember telling us
about that guy you met way back,

06:34.102 --> 06:35.434
who was shipping for us out of here?

06:36.521 --> 06:38.638
Evan. What about him?

06:38.732 --> 06:43.443
Well, you'll never believe it,
but it turns out he was a narc.

06:43.528 --> 06:46.191
Undercover. A snitch.

06:46.281 --> 06:47.817
What?

06:47.908 --> 06:50.150
- Are you serious?
- Spare it, Andy.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.030
I had no idea.

06:52.120 --> 06:55.033
You brought Evan in. You knew.

06:55.123 --> 06:57.740
I swear on my mother's life,
I had no fucking idea.

06:57.834 --> 07:01.043
So we started looking at other little things,

07:01.129 --> 07:03.496
speaking to people here and there, about you.

07:03.590 --> 07:04.626
This is bollocks.

07:04.758 --> 07:08.377
'Cause it's the little things
that count, isn't it, Andy?

07:08.511 --> 07:11.379
No. No, it's Evan. He
must have been stirring.

07:13.308 --> 07:15.766
All of those wee little things...

07:15.894 --> 07:17.305
Don't be silly.

07:17.395 --> 07:19.227
- ...add up to one...
- Don't.

07:19.314 --> 07:20.680
...big thing!

07:30.909 --> 07:33.947
We just want to know
who you've been talking to.

07:34.079 --> 07:36.321
- Dear God, please.
- God?

07:37.832 --> 07:39.994
He knows you're a Judas as well.

07:40.669 --> 07:42.911
So you can drop the act, eh?

07:43.004 --> 07:44.540
We know everything.

07:47.759 --> 07:49.250
All right, Doyle.

07:59.437 --> 08:01.429
You gonna kill me now?

08:01.564 --> 08:05.023
Well, if it were up to me,
you two-faced, backstabbing...

08:05.819 --> 08:07.856
...undercover fuck,

08:10.281 --> 08:12.238
I'd hold you underwater

08:12.325 --> 08:16.239
and watch till your last breath
bubbled to the surface.

08:23.878 --> 08:25.210
But

08:26.256 --> 08:31.843
Mr Donovan reckons
you love being a field agent.

08:33.263 --> 08:35.004
Doyle, don't be silly.

08:35.097 --> 08:37.385
Just get me Donovan. Let me talk to him.

08:38.393 --> 08:39.929
Imagine...

08:41.563 --> 08:45.147
Imagine if you were
suddenly impaired physically.

08:46.901 --> 08:48.437
You'd have to take a desk job, wouldn't you?

08:48.528 --> 08:50.565
Just let me talk to him. Let me talk to him.

08:50.655 --> 08:53.489
Just let me talk to him.
Just let me talk to him.

08:55.201 --> 08:58.694
And that would be like a prison sentence
for someone like you.

08:58.788 --> 09:01.201
Just get me Donovan. Just get me Donovan.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.203
Get me Donovan. No.

09:05.962 --> 09:08.124
Now, I've not done this before,

09:08.214 --> 09:12.003
so you'll have to forgive me if I fuck it up.

09:22.520 --> 09:26.104
Andy here's the last agent
who managed to get even close to Tango One.

09:26.232 --> 09:27.518
To Donovan.

09:27.609 --> 09:29.851
He's the best we ever produced.
And we almost...

09:29.986 --> 09:31.648
Fucking almost had the bastard.

09:31.780 --> 09:35.194
I was with him
when his last really big deal went through.

09:35.283 --> 09:37.024
$30 million.

09:37.118 --> 09:38.859
Then I brought someone in
who was on our side,

09:38.953 --> 09:41.696
but, um, he fucked up.

09:42.123 --> 09:45.912
Donovan seems to be able to
just spot anyone we set against him.

09:46.044 --> 09:49.583
So we need to change our tactics.
We need to get dirty.

09:49.714 --> 09:51.455
And we need your sign-off on this.

09:51.549 --> 09:54.963
Look, I'm sorry I'm not going to give you
a PowerPoint presentation,

09:55.053 --> 09:57.215
but none of this can be official.

09:57.305 --> 09:59.797
Donovan has connections everywhere.

09:59.933 --> 10:03.552
Now, I'm fucked.
Donovan's ruined my life plan.

10:03.645 --> 10:05.307
I'd really like to ruin his.

10:05.980 --> 10:07.937
So, what's this new approach?

10:08.066 --> 10:09.898
We need to attack Donovan from every angle.

10:09.984 --> 10:12.226
We need to honey-trap him with a mistress,

10:12.320 --> 10:15.904
get someone
to start fucking his wife or his daughter.

10:15.990 --> 10:18.528
Someone to be his cleaner, his chauffeur.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.325
Someone in his legal team, accounts.

10:20.411 --> 10:22.903
Someone he trusts in security.
One of them will pay off.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.200
How long do you need?

10:24.332 --> 10:26.574
Well, these targets
are going to be tough to find,

10:26.668 --> 10:29.251
so it's not going to be months.

10:29.337 --> 10:30.999
This is going to take years.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.510
No middlemen at all.

10:38.596 --> 10:42.385
We can drop our product anytime, anywhere.

10:42.475 --> 10:45.388
Much more reasonable
than those fucking Colombians, yes?

10:47.564 --> 10:51.274
And how do you manage
to buy all these planes and ships?

10:51.359 --> 10:53.271
Who said I buy them?

10:53.361 --> 10:57.446
In Russia, if you can steal, you steal.

10:57.532 --> 11:00.525
Air Force so big anyway,
they'll not miss one less plane.

11:02.495 --> 11:03.656
But we have business?

11:05.874 --> 11:08.582
I need to get some finance in place.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.286
Because I can go to other people,

11:12.714 --> 11:14.546
but I want business with you.

11:26.352 --> 11:27.843
I'll keep in touch.

11:33.234 --> 11:35.271
Hi, Vicky. It's me.

11:35.361 --> 11:39.696
I'm just about to fly home.
I was hoping to talk to you and Zoe.

11:39.782 --> 11:40.989
I love you.

12:01.262 --> 12:03.128
How was the flight?

12:05.141 --> 12:07.929
- Long.
- You made an impression on the Russians.

12:08.019 --> 12:10.011
They sent you a gift. By the pool.

12:29.332 --> 12:31.540
I'm Elektra.

12:31.626 --> 12:33.492
And I'm married.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.373
Is your wife here?

12:37.048 --> 12:39.415
Then what does it matter?

12:39.509 --> 12:41.967
It matters to me. Enjoy the view.

12:43.554 --> 12:45.386
I am.

12:45.473 --> 12:48.090
Boy, to be young and single. Doyle.

12:48.559 --> 12:49.800
Sir.

12:51.896 --> 12:55.185
Would you mind driving Miss Elektra home?

12:55.275 --> 12:57.141
My pleasure, boss.

13:00.655 --> 13:04.319
So, Elektra, your time's
been paid for, right?

13:04.409 --> 13:07.117
He was quite specific who I should entertain.

13:07.203 --> 13:08.739
Fucking Russians.

13:08.830 --> 13:12.915
Vicky, it's me, your husband, again. Call me.

13:20.174 --> 13:21.836
Oh, that feels so good.

13:23.344 --> 13:26.337
Oh, shit. Oh, that feels so good.

13:26.431 --> 13:29.424
Oh, fuck, fuck.
We need to go upstairs before Zoe gets home.

13:29.559 --> 13:31.642
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Just... Just give me a minute.

13:31.769 --> 13:33.226
She could be home at any moment.

13:33.354 --> 13:34.811
She's not going to give a fuck.

13:34.897 --> 13:36.809
She doesn't give a fuck about anyone,

13:36.941 --> 13:39.433
but she'll waste no time
in stirring it up between me and him.

13:39.527 --> 13:42.486
Oh, fuck him. He does my head in.

13:42.613 --> 13:44.229
We should just take his money and go.

13:44.365 --> 13:47.278
Why? What we've got is perfect.

13:47.410 --> 13:50.073
Yeah, yeah, it's not.
I want you. I want you to myself.

13:50.204 --> 13:51.490
You've got me.

13:52.040 --> 13:55.033
- Do you want to stay with him?
- We've been through this.

13:55.126 --> 13:57.789
I'm his wife, but he controls us.

13:57.879 --> 14:00.872
- What, because he's got money?
- And money's important.

14:01.007 --> 14:02.293
You do know I'm his accountant?

14:02.383 --> 14:05.126
- I literally can take all of his money.
- You can do that?

14:06.429 --> 14:08.386
- How?
- Finish me off and I'll tell you.

14:11.809 --> 14:12.970
Please, just a little bit more.

14:13.061 --> 14:14.643
Look, bitch,
you've hoovered up enough tonight

14:14.729 --> 14:15.719
to become a walking drugs mule.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.347
I just need a bit more.

14:18.775 --> 14:21.893
All right, look... Ah-ah-ah!
Don't kiss me with those lips, all right?

14:22.028 --> 14:23.940
I don't know where you've been all evening.

14:24.030 --> 14:24.986
Please?

14:27.867 --> 14:30.075
All right, I'll tell you what.

14:30.161 --> 14:33.029
You can have this

14:33.164 --> 14:36.202
if you can make me happy.

14:36.793 --> 14:38.329
Is that the same gear as earlier?

14:39.670 --> 14:42.834
Beggars and choosers, Zoe.
Beggars and choosers.

14:45.510 --> 14:46.626
All right.

14:48.304 --> 14:49.590
Go on.

14:55.144 --> 14:57.056
All right, yeah, less of the groaning.

14:57.146 --> 14:58.853
More hand action, yeah.

15:00.817 --> 15:02.183
Fuck!

15:03.528 --> 15:06.145
Go! Get the fuck out, you
dirty fucking bitch!

15:16.707 --> 15:18.790
Jesus fucking Christ!

15:22.130 --> 15:23.917
Whoa. Don't leave me on the edge.

15:24.006 --> 15:27.124
Are you fucking kidding me?
I've got to go and stop Zoe telling her dad.

15:27.218 --> 15:28.959
She's fucking high. He's busy.

15:29.095 --> 15:31.132
I'm busy. What's the urgency?

15:31.264 --> 15:34.382
Just making sure
everything's on its way to the UK.

15:34.475 --> 15:37.092
<i>- Why wouldn't it be?</i>
- Things can happen.

15:37.186 --> 15:40.304
<i>Has anything happened the countless times
we've done business?</i>

15:40.398 --> 15:42.014
No.

15:42.108 --> 15:44.521
Fair enough. Don't worry about it.

15:44.610 --> 15:47.353
I know that Carlos ain't gonna...

15:47.488 --> 15:48.649
Carlos?

15:49.657 --> 15:53.276
Uh, yeah, you mentioned someone
called Carlos would be, uh...

15:53.411 --> 15:56.028
I never mention names,

15:56.122 --> 15:59.832
and you should definitely
never mention his name to anyone.

15:59.917 --> 16:01.909
- My mistake.
<i>- Definitely your mistake.</i>

16:02.044 --> 16:03.125
Boss.

16:03.963 --> 16:04.953
It's him.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.672
Hello? Hello?

16:21.022 --> 16:23.639
Carlos. An unexpected surprise.

16:23.733 --> 16:25.144
And yet, you were expecting me.

16:25.276 --> 16:27.814
- I have friends at the airport.
- I flew into a private airport.

16:27.945 --> 16:29.231
I have friends at every airport.

16:29.864 --> 16:31.605
Huh.

16:32.158 --> 16:35.196
Anyway, it was just too hot and humid
in Colombia at the moment,

16:35.286 --> 16:36.868
so I decided to come here.

16:36.954 --> 16:39.287
Don't get me wrong. I like things hot,

16:39.415 --> 16:41.407
but I just... I hate to sweat.

16:41.542 --> 16:43.033
Well, if you're looking
for somewhere to stay...

16:43.169 --> 16:45.411
That's just so kind of you,
Donovan, thank you,

16:45.505 --> 16:48.919
but I would never invade your beautiful home.

16:52.094 --> 16:54.177
Carlos, have I ever let you down?

16:54.263 --> 16:57.051
Donovan, have I ever let you down?

16:59.227 --> 17:01.059
Have you been talking to my London contact?

17:01.145 --> 17:03.228
Have you been talking to some Russians?

17:04.397 --> 17:07.357
See, you're not the only one
that has friends at airports.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.859
What's all this about, Carlos?

17:10.946 --> 17:15.317
You know, Donovan,
when people start talking to Russians,

17:15.409 --> 17:16.694
trouble is usually not far away.

17:17.078 --> 17:18.990
I'm sorry you feel the
need to check up on me.

17:19.079 --> 17:20.491
No, it's not that.

17:20.580 --> 17:23.164
No, no, no, no. Knowledge is power.

17:23.251 --> 17:26.618
- Money is power.
- Money. Knowledge. Power. It's all connected.

17:26.712 --> 17:29.546
- But this new friend of yours...
- No friend of mine.

17:30.758 --> 17:35.128
As I was saying, this new friend of yours

17:35.221 --> 17:37.964
is sneaking weapons to Colombia
for the guerrilla.

17:38.933 --> 17:41.346
Do you know that?

17:41.435 --> 17:44.519
Well, what the Russians choose to do
in their spare time is of no concern to me.

17:44.939 --> 17:46.555
Good, good.

17:46.649 --> 17:48.766
Well, guns in, cocaine out.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.359
Makes a very messy business.

17:51.445 --> 17:52.936
So my friends at the Colombian government,

17:53.030 --> 17:55.363
they're not happy
about the guerrilla getting stronger.

17:55.491 --> 17:56.857
Do you understand that?

17:56.951 --> 17:59.364
Like I said, I know nothing of this.

17:59.453 --> 18:01.365
Right.

18:01.497 --> 18:04.160
Perhaps that's them on the phone?

18:05.960 --> 18:07.041
No, it's not.

18:10.381 --> 18:13.840
Look, I know it's your second language,
but can we speak plain English?

18:13.968 --> 18:15.175
Why are you here?

18:16.053 --> 18:20.673
Well, Russians are uneducated thugs
that will kill you,

18:20.766 --> 18:24.976
as you say, in plain English,
at the drop of hats.

18:25.062 --> 18:26.348
Uh...

18:26.856 --> 18:28.939
That's exactly
what they say about the Colombians.

18:29.066 --> 18:31.023
- Can I call her back?
- I think you need to hear this.

18:31.152 --> 18:33.485
You just take it if it's important.

18:36.157 --> 18:38.774
Hi, Zoe. I'm right in the middle
of something here, love.

18:38.909 --> 18:41.151
Dad, Mum's fucking the accountant.

18:42.413 --> 18:44.450
What are you talking about?

18:44.582 --> 18:46.824
I don't know if this is the first time or...

18:46.959 --> 18:48.495
You sound odd, Zoe. Are you all right?

18:49.045 --> 18:50.832
Zoe! Zoe!

18:50.921 --> 18:52.878
- Open this door right now!
- Dad, I've got to go.

18:53.591 --> 18:55.583
Zoe, wait!

19:07.188 --> 19:09.851
- Fuck.
- Whoa, that was important.

19:10.608 --> 19:12.770
I've never heard you swear before.

19:14.028 --> 19:15.485
It's nothing. It's...

19:16.447 --> 19:20.031
- Just a... Something personal.
- I understand.

19:20.117 --> 19:24.532
Hey, as long as your personal business
doesn't interfere with my business.

19:25.623 --> 19:27.956
You have 24 hours to get me my money, okay?

19:29.919 --> 19:34.334
Should you not comply to do this,
I could consider that a default.

19:36.133 --> 19:39.422
And in my world, no one defaults.

19:40.137 --> 19:41.378
No one.

19:48.437 --> 19:49.848
You all right, boss?

19:51.565 --> 19:52.806
Why the fuck did you call him?

19:52.900 --> 19:55.233
I thought he should know about you and him.

19:56.821 --> 19:59.313
Can you just give us a minute?

19:59.448 --> 20:02.156
Well, maybe he should know
about some of your little secrets.

20:02.284 --> 20:03.991
Oh, what, you mean the drugs?

20:04.078 --> 20:05.865
Yeah, like you give a fuck about that.

20:05.996 --> 20:07.953
I could be dead in a gutter
and you wouldn't notice, Mum.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.623
Oh, I get it.
You're just doing it for attention, right?

20:10.710 --> 20:14.704
You're married to a good man,
and you're fucking a weasel of a man.

20:14.797 --> 20:16.038
What does that say about you?

20:16.924 --> 20:20.008
I literally just walked in
on you giving a man a blow job.

20:20.136 --> 20:21.877
Are you saying...

20:22.012 --> 20:24.629
- I'm your mother, and I'm the one...
- You're barely my mother.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.681
Your stupid dad
is not raring to look after you.

20:26.767 --> 20:30.010
And you think he's so fantastic,
so great, and you hate me.

20:30.104 --> 20:33.848
I can't even listen to this.
I cannot even listen to this right now.

20:36.318 --> 20:38.526
Stewart Sharkey.

20:38.612 --> 20:40.069
What's going on?

20:40.156 --> 20:42.944
I'm being screwed by the same guy
who's screwing my wife.

20:43.033 --> 20:44.274
Fuck.

20:48.330 --> 20:51.539
- He's cleaned my accounts out.
- What?

20:51.625 --> 20:53.662
I promised the number one supplier
in Colombia

20:53.753 --> 20:56.086
I'd have his money by tomorrow,
and now it's gone.

20:56.172 --> 20:58.414
Well, I'll set up a meeting,
find out where he's staying.

20:58.507 --> 21:01.625
It would be a very short meeting,
and I wouldn't be leaving it alive.

21:01.719 --> 21:04.462
Now, I want you to stay here.
Keep a low profile.

21:04.555 --> 21:06.922
What are you going to do?

21:07.016 --> 21:08.302
Go home.

21:09.435 --> 21:12.599
- It'll be okay, Vics.
- How is it going to be okay?

21:12.688 --> 21:14.554
He'll be coming for us right now.

21:14.648 --> 21:17.982
He's not fucking Superman.
It's an eight-hour flight, for a start.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.441
- Come on.
- Just leave me alone.

21:22.531 --> 21:24.693
This is all your fault.

21:25.493 --> 21:27.029
That's not fair.

21:27.119 --> 21:29.577
He's hardly going to care about what's fair.

21:29.663 --> 21:31.746
I always said not there.

21:31.832 --> 21:34.415
Your place, hotels. That's what we agreed.

21:34.502 --> 21:36.585
But you just had to
do it in his bed, didn't you?

21:36.670 --> 21:38.582
Spray your fucking seed on the competition.

21:38.672 --> 21:41.961
- Oh, so it's all my fucking fault, is it?
- He's going to kill us.

21:42.051 --> 21:44.418
He'll need to find us to do that.

21:44.512 --> 21:46.799
Look, can't you see this is meant to be?

21:46.889 --> 21:49.256
Us together, properly.

21:49.350 --> 21:52.434
I'm fed up with him treating you like shit
and me like a servant.

21:52.520 --> 21:55.263
We both deserve a better life,
and you're going to get that.

21:55.356 --> 21:57.518
And how are you going to afford that?

21:57.608 --> 22:00.225
I transferred his money
into an off-shore account.

22:02.488 --> 22:04.150
You serious?

22:05.950 --> 22:07.191
We're rich.

22:23.759 --> 22:24.920
Sir.

22:29.056 --> 22:31.764
You know,
you're going to get a really sore throat

22:31.851 --> 22:33.183
if you keep shouting like that.

22:33.686 --> 22:37.396
It's all right because
we've got plenty of water for you.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.394
Don't go anywhere.

22:42.069 --> 22:44.652
Sorry to interrupt. Are you okay, sir?

22:44.738 --> 22:46.479
What? Yeah, I was married once.

22:46.574 --> 22:49.362
You get used to that kind of verbal abuse.
It's nothing. What is it?

22:49.451 --> 22:52.068
Okay. I thought you'd like to see this.

22:54.039 --> 22:55.655
Donovan's house.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.710
Well, well.

23:00.796 --> 23:03.038
- I wonder what he'll make of this.
- He already knows.

23:03.757 --> 23:06.340
The daughter called him.
I've sent you the taped conversation.

23:06.427 --> 23:09.090
Well, I do believe the cock
will be coming home to roost.

23:09.179 --> 23:10.715
Alert airport security, for what it's worth,

23:10.848 --> 23:13.056
- and head up a team to cover the house.
- Sir.

23:13.142 --> 23:14.758
- When was this?
- About an hour ago.

23:14.852 --> 23:17.469
Right, have them tracked.
Get me some high-quality images from that.

23:17.563 --> 23:18.644
Sir.

23:27.281 --> 23:28.863
Any sign?

23:42.087 --> 23:43.874
Come on, Donovan. Where are you?

23:43.964 --> 23:45.080
<i>Anything?</i>

23:45.925 --> 23:47.041
<i>Not a peep, sir.</i>

23:47.134 --> 23:49.672
- That's suspicious. Have a walk around.
- Sir.

24:51.156 --> 24:52.613
I think I hear something.

24:52.700 --> 24:55.317
<i>We have to be certain Donovan is inside.</i>

25:15.055 --> 25:16.717
Approaching the house.

25:19.226 --> 25:21.138
Living room clear.

25:32.239 --> 25:33.696
Someone's inside the kitchen.

25:40.622 --> 25:41.783
Oh!

25:51.383 --> 25:53.420
Wait. There's something.

25:56.388 --> 25:57.674
<i>What does it mean?</i>

26:02.436 --> 26:04.018
It's a broken compass.

26:04.938 --> 26:07.180
It means misdirection.
The fucker knew we were watching.

26:07.274 --> 26:09.106
He was probably there an hour before us.

26:12.780 --> 26:15.614
Is it ever too early for champagne?

26:16.825 --> 26:18.862
Your boss, he doesn't mind?

26:20.913 --> 26:24.452
While the cat's away, the mice will play.

26:25.250 --> 26:26.832
Speaking of pussy...

26:30.839 --> 26:33.331
What? I paid for you for the whole day.

26:33.467 --> 26:35.379
I didn't know I'd be working all day.

26:35.511 --> 26:37.298
Well, what can I tell you, Elektra?

26:37.387 --> 26:39.504
You're so damn horny to look at.

26:46.396 --> 26:47.978
Ohh!

26:57.324 --> 26:58.860
- Carlos.
- What?

27:03.330 --> 27:04.992
I checked my account this morning, Doyle.

27:05.124 --> 27:06.160
Nothing there.

27:06.291 --> 27:07.907
There was a problem.

27:08.001 --> 27:11.244
Mr Donovan's sorting it out.

27:11.338 --> 27:15.002
And now, why is his problem
all of a sudden my problem?

27:15.509 --> 27:17.250
Shh.

27:20.222 --> 27:21.338
Where is he?

27:22.516 --> 27:25.099
In London, I told you, sorting it out.
You'll get your fucking money.

27:25.227 --> 27:27.093
You bet your ass I will.

27:28.313 --> 27:31.681
But I have to send a message
now that Donovan has failed me.

27:33.569 --> 27:36.687
It's the downside of being
somebody else's henchman, Doyle.

27:36.822 --> 27:39.405
It's not all champagne and hooker blow jobs.

27:39.533 --> 27:40.944
No offence.

27:41.577 --> 27:44.866
Carlos. Mr Rodriguez, please.

27:45.372 --> 27:47.785
- Mmm-hmm?
- What do you want from me?

27:49.126 --> 27:50.287
How can I get in touch with him?

27:50.419 --> 27:52.502
He's off-radar.

27:52.588 --> 27:54.750
The moment anyone
knows he's back in the UK,

27:54.840 --> 27:56.172
he'll be back on the most wanted list.

27:56.300 --> 27:57.381
Oh, yes, yes.

27:57.467 --> 28:01.802
He did say something about this,
uh, Tango One status, right?

28:01.889 --> 28:03.300
He wouldn't have told you that.

28:04.725 --> 28:08.264
And yet, somehow I know. Weird, huh?

28:12.065 --> 28:15.399
So, how could you get in touch with him,

28:15.903 --> 28:19.567
say, if you were in a desperate situation,
like this one?

28:20.616 --> 28:22.073
It's impossible.

28:25.621 --> 28:26.702
Come on, Doyle.

28:26.830 --> 28:29.072
You can do better than that.

28:34.963 --> 28:36.170
I've got a number.

28:36.298 --> 28:37.755
A number.

28:39.218 --> 28:40.334
Now we're talking.

28:40.802 --> 28:42.509
Interesting.

28:42.596 --> 28:44.713
And I'm sure you have
a lot of addresses here as well.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.637
Carlos, if you just...

28:48.727 --> 28:51.265
- Just let me call him and sort it out.
- But wait.

28:52.105 --> 28:54.392
If I have your phone,

28:54.524 --> 28:56.265
why the hell do I need you then?

28:59.613 --> 29:00.694
<i>En agua.</i>

29:00.822 --> 29:03.280
No, no. Wait. Please.

29:03.408 --> 29:06.401
No. No. Carlos, please.

29:06.536 --> 29:07.822
No.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.039
So...

29:12.125 --> 29:13.741
What is it going to be? Hmm?

29:14.419 --> 29:15.626
Deep throat

29:16.088 --> 29:17.704
or deep end?

29:25.138 --> 29:26.800
<i>Doyle, it's me again.</i>

29:27.266 --> 29:28.552
Call me back.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.525
Hi.

29:47.619 --> 29:49.235
Hi, Dad.

29:50.330 --> 29:51.821
What...

29:51.957 --> 29:53.368
Let me speak first.

29:56.044 --> 29:57.205
How long have you been taking drugs?

29:58.338 --> 30:00.500
I... It's nothing.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.464
- It's just...
- How long?

30:03.218 --> 30:04.675
That was, like, my first time.

30:06.013 --> 30:07.800
Don't lie to me, Zoe.

30:10.392 --> 30:11.974
I found these in your room.

30:14.187 --> 30:15.974
And you've lost a lot of weight
since I saw you last.

30:16.064 --> 30:17.100
You remember when that was?

30:18.900 --> 30:21.142
I know I haven't been
the greatest father in the world,

30:21.278 --> 30:24.066
but you know why I can't be in the UK.

30:24.156 --> 30:27.320
And yet, you can be here
if you choose. Like now.

30:27.409 --> 30:30.777
To sort this mess out,
and now it seems to sort you out, too.

30:30.871 --> 30:32.988
- I'm fine.
- Well, you don't look it,

30:33.081 --> 30:34.492
and I'm going to get you clean.

30:35.459 --> 30:37.325
You can't just show up and do this.

30:37.419 --> 30:39.126
This is my life, and you left it.

30:39.212 --> 30:41.955
I left you here, with your mum,

30:42.049 --> 30:43.915
so you could finish private school.

30:45.677 --> 30:47.213
Oh-ho.

30:47.304 --> 30:48.545
Another surprise.

30:49.681 --> 30:51.297
Please tell me you're still at school.

30:52.476 --> 30:54.763
I quit last term.

30:54.895 --> 30:56.477
It was boring, and Mum said it didn't matter.

30:56.563 --> 30:58.395
Oh, did she?

30:58.482 --> 31:00.223
When was anyone going to tell me?

31:01.068 --> 31:04.436
Huh. Well, the school is still charging me.

31:04.529 --> 31:06.361
Biggest crooks I've ever come across.

31:06.448 --> 31:08.280
Hey, clean and dry.

31:08.408 --> 31:09.865
Vodka.

31:17.667 --> 31:18.783
Where's Mum?

31:19.586 --> 31:21.248
She did a runner.

31:22.714 --> 31:25.127
I don't suppose
she mentioned anything to you?

31:25.258 --> 31:27.716
It wasn't that kind of goodbye
when I saw her last.

31:29.304 --> 31:32.342
What are you going to do?
Hunt them down and fuck him up?

31:32.474 --> 31:33.510
If he's lucky.

31:34.142 --> 31:36.600
And don't swear. You know I don't like it.

31:45.445 --> 31:48.313
Hey!

31:49.658 --> 31:52.822
Fuck me. You look younger, Mr D.

31:52.953 --> 31:55.787
Fuck me. You look older, Zoe.

31:55.872 --> 31:57.864
I am older since you last saw me.

31:57.958 --> 31:59.824
Aye, not that fucking old, eh?

31:59.918 --> 32:02.877
No wonder he wants me
to make you go cold turkey.

32:03.004 --> 32:05.997
Wait. What? You're getting one of your old
gangster friends to take care of me?

32:06.133 --> 32:09.672
- Good parenting, Dad.
- Zoe, it's just for today.

32:10.971 --> 32:13.088
I've got some serious business
I need to put to rest,

32:13.181 --> 32:14.717
then you become my priority.

32:14.850 --> 32:18.264
Once again,
I'm way down the list of priorities.

32:19.604 --> 32:20.594
Zoe.

32:23.316 --> 32:26.605
I don't think you're paying me enough.
This is going to be horrors.

32:26.736 --> 32:27.977
I appreciate it.

32:29.239 --> 32:31.481
Take her to the lockup in the countryside.

32:32.492 --> 32:34.404
And don't take any of her attitude.

32:35.579 --> 32:39.118
Are you okay, Mr D? It sounds like
you've got a lot on your hands.

32:39.207 --> 32:40.573
The less you know, the better.

32:40.709 --> 32:42.416
- You take care.
- Aye.

32:54.473 --> 32:55.554
It's good to see you.

32:57.184 --> 32:59.471
Only because you're billing me for your time.

32:59.561 --> 33:00.677
Ah.

33:03.815 --> 33:06.148
How much do you know?

33:06.234 --> 33:07.816
Nothing.

33:11.740 --> 33:13.026
Everything.

33:14.868 --> 33:18.407
But I can tell you that there is a Mr Big,

33:18.497 --> 33:19.783
from South America,

33:20.248 --> 33:23.366
who is coming here for you, in London.

33:26.671 --> 33:28.537
- You know this for sure?
- Of course.

33:29.549 --> 33:33.008
In this line of business, I need to be sure.

33:37.933 --> 33:39.674
My wife and accountant.

33:41.102 --> 33:42.968
I know.

33:43.063 --> 33:44.850
I mean,

33:44.940 --> 33:47.683
who would want to lose their wife to, uh...

33:47.776 --> 33:50.359
Well, to an accountant?

33:58.537 --> 34:00.028
They'll know I'm looking for them,

34:00.121 --> 34:02.704
so I need them found fast.

34:04.251 --> 34:07.415
Do you never want to see them again
orjust have conversation?

34:07.546 --> 34:10.038
- Both.
- In which order?

34:17.889 --> 34:20.802
Are you sure? Regarding your wife.

34:21.976 --> 34:23.934
The police will suspect.

34:24.062 --> 34:26.929
It will be something else they can
get you on. You do realise that.

34:28.275 --> 34:29.482
I don't care.

34:31.527 --> 34:35.112
I can make it painful, or I can
make it quick. You decide.

34:35.197 --> 34:36.688
No.

34:36.783 --> 34:38.524
I know how I want it done.

34:46.543 --> 34:49.001
There he is. Got your message.

34:49.087 --> 34:52.205
- This is?
- Jamie Fullerton.

34:52.340 --> 34:54.127
Finger-on-the-pulse kind of chap.

34:55.427 --> 34:57.635
He knows all the quick buyers
in the business.

34:58.888 --> 35:02.381
Maury, I asked you to shift these paintings.

35:02.475 --> 35:05.684
Please don't tell me you've been
broadcasting I need quick buyers.

35:05.770 --> 35:07.352
No, no, no. Listen, listen.

35:07.439 --> 35:10.398
The market isn't the same
as when you bought them.

35:10.483 --> 35:13.396
Don't tell me I'll lose money on them.
"Solid gold", you told me.

35:13.486 --> 35:15.273
They're holding their value.

35:15.864 --> 35:17.571
It's the speed you wanna sell 'em.

35:17.699 --> 35:18.815
He's your man.

35:20.619 --> 35:23.282
I take it
you want these sold super pronto?

35:26.499 --> 35:27.910
Why do you say that?

35:28.793 --> 35:30.204
That's why people come to me.

35:30.295 --> 35:33.003
Fast sale, quick cash. Expeditious.

35:33.089 --> 35:35.581
- And you can guarantee that?
- Depends on what's for sale.

35:35.717 --> 35:37.674
But what you've got here is good.

35:38.011 --> 35:39.843
Very, very good.

35:40.472 --> 35:42.054
It's a shame, really.

35:42.182 --> 35:44.048
If you held out more,
you could strike a bargain.

35:44.142 --> 35:47.010
And if I did just want to cash in...

35:48.355 --> 35:50.142
How much do you think these could make?

35:50.273 --> 35:53.437
Ah, Jamie's got buyers in the city.

35:53.526 --> 35:55.142
Clients with money to burn.

35:55.236 --> 35:58.320
But, listen, I can take
those van Dyck sketches off you now.

36:00.200 --> 36:01.361
What would you like for 'em?

36:01.826 --> 36:03.738
Well, you tell me. I bought them off you.

36:03.828 --> 36:05.114
One hundred and fifty.

36:05.205 --> 36:06.412
Two hundred.

36:06.498 --> 36:08.911
The Rembrandt there is gold dust.

36:09.042 --> 36:11.284
I'll have no problem shifting that on.

36:11.378 --> 36:14.621
I'm amazed these aren't in a safe somewhere.
You should be careful.

36:16.007 --> 36:19.500
Mr Donovan has a certain reputation.

36:19.636 --> 36:21.502
Only a fool would steal from him.

36:22.055 --> 36:25.514
I need the money in banker's draughts
made out to this name.

36:27.727 --> 36:29.764
- Carl...
- Only you need to know the name.

36:29.854 --> 36:31.937
Let's keep Maury out of this.

36:32.023 --> 36:33.389
Thank you, old boy.

36:33.483 --> 36:35.224
Right, now you have the name.

36:36.444 --> 36:38.652
You have the paintings.
Now just get me the money.

36:38.738 --> 36:40.650
Oh, and one more thing.

36:40.782 --> 36:43.775
I'm in an unforgiving frame of mind
at the moment.

36:44.786 --> 36:46.152
Don't try to cheat me.

37:07.642 --> 37:09.429
Go on, you fucker, you!

37:11.604 --> 37:12.515
Jesus!

37:13.398 --> 37:14.514
Gun, Zoe!

37:21.573 --> 37:23.860
Ray? Ray, are you okay?

37:40.550 --> 37:43.668
Yeah, yeah, it's Donovan. He's home.

37:43.762 --> 37:44.969
Donovan.

38:14.375 --> 38:15.786
<i>Daddy?</i>

38:17.086 --> 38:18.668
<i>They want to talk to you.</i>

38:19.380 --> 38:21.497
<i>- Are you there?</i>
- Zoe?

38:23.676 --> 38:25.338
So, where's my money?

38:25.970 --> 38:27.677
It's temporarily unavailable.

38:28.765 --> 38:30.006
Wrong answer.

38:34.437 --> 38:36.224
<i>Amigo,</i> let me explain the situation.

38:38.900 --> 38:40.516
I'm very tired.

38:40.610 --> 38:43.318
Very jet-lagged. My feet are cold.

38:44.531 --> 38:47.524
And I have come from a fucking long way
to collect my debt.

38:47.867 --> 38:49.449
So what do we do?

38:53.873 --> 38:57.241
Donovan, you never told me
that your daughter was so cute.

38:59.087 --> 39:01.204
- You dare touch her...
- And you'll do what exactly? Huh?

39:02.215 --> 39:03.331
Let her go.

39:04.050 --> 39:05.461
But not Ray, right?

39:05.552 --> 39:07.384
Poor old Ray, huh?

39:07.470 --> 39:09.257
He doesn't mean as much to you.

39:09.389 --> 39:10.630
Like Doyle.

39:12.183 --> 39:13.469
Your money's coming.

39:13.601 --> 39:14.591
Hmm.

39:15.895 --> 39:19.764
I'm pretty sure the only thing
that will be coming tonight

39:19.899 --> 39:21.765
will be me.

39:22.527 --> 39:24.940
You're a smart man, Carlos.

39:25.071 --> 39:26.812
You kill us, you'll never see your money.

39:26.948 --> 39:30.441
I like to think of myself as a smart man.
Mmm-hmm.

39:30.535 --> 39:33.869
And as a smart man, I know for a fact

39:35.373 --> 39:39.242
that I just have to keep your ass alive
in order to get my money.

39:40.545 --> 39:42.411
Have you heard of the Colombian necktie?

39:43.131 --> 39:45.748
I'm sure you have.
You're a very well-travelled man.

39:48.553 --> 39:51.341
But have you seen it...

39:51.431 --> 39:53.889
What's the word? Uh, per... "Performed"?

39:54.017 --> 39:56.475
Is that a word? "Performed"?
Have you seen it performed?

39:56.603 --> 39:58.469
Um, see it "executed".

39:58.563 --> 40:00.179
- Oh, that's good. That's better.
- Mmm-hmm.

40:00.773 --> 40:03.186
You'll get your money. I swear.

40:03.318 --> 40:05.651
- Don't do this.
- Of course you will get me my money.

40:06.529 --> 40:09.021
I was ripped off by my accountant.

40:09.115 --> 40:11.072
He's taken everything. Done a runner.

40:11.200 --> 40:15.194
All I can hear right now is,
"I am in a deep shit".

40:15.330 --> 40:18.448
I can get you $1 million in cash, now.

40:18.541 --> 40:20.783
I have someone selling my art collection,

40:20.877 --> 40:25.121
and that will bring in around $3 million
tomorrow night.

40:29.052 --> 40:31.009
That's not even half of what you owe me.

40:31.095 --> 40:33.929
But the gear hasn't arrived yet.
I've not ripped you off.

40:34.057 --> 40:35.593
Listen, okay. Sorry about that.

40:35.683 --> 40:38.847
I think we can deal with this
in a better fashion, okay?

40:38.978 --> 40:43.188
As a sign of goodwill,
I am willing to accept this.

40:43.274 --> 40:46.858
You bring me almost half of the money
you owe me tomorrow,

40:47.362 --> 40:48.648
and in exchange,

40:48.780 --> 40:52.615
I will give you
almost half of your friend today.

40:52.742 --> 40:55.075
- What do you think? Huh?
- Zoe. Zoe, look at me.

40:55.203 --> 40:56.489
Look at me. Don't look. Look at me!

41:11.636 --> 41:13.002
Oh, come on, Donovan.

41:14.347 --> 41:16.634
You know he was dead
the minute you call him.

41:17.684 --> 41:20.301
So what do we do
to keep your daughter alive?

41:24.857 --> 41:26.348
He was such a lovely man.

41:27.193 --> 41:28.354
He was.

41:29.278 --> 41:31.361
So, tell me about these customers of yours.

41:32.699 --> 41:34.907
Do they pay you
the minute they get the merchandise?

41:37.036 --> 41:39.028
- They do, sure.
- The $12 million?

41:41.040 --> 41:42.247
Fourteen.

41:43.459 --> 41:44.620
Whoa.

41:44.711 --> 41:47.124
Four... $14 million?

41:47.213 --> 41:51.332
That's a fucking great deal,
you sneaky little bastard.

41:51.467 --> 41:53.834
And are they aware
of your financial struggles?

41:54.429 --> 41:57.513
Listen, just let her go,
and we'll sort this out.

41:57.598 --> 41:58.884
Oh, boy.

42:00.018 --> 42:02.351
Oh, you really are in a
deep shit, aren't you?

42:03.646 --> 42:06.389
Because if I don't kill you, they will.

42:06.482 --> 42:07.848
But if they kill you,

42:09.402 --> 42:10.609
I lose everything.

42:10.737 --> 42:13.104
When the gear arrives,

42:13.197 --> 42:15.359
they'll pay me the $14 million.

42:15.450 --> 42:18.659
Plus the cash and the paintings.

42:18.745 --> 42:20.361
That's over $18 million.

42:20.496 --> 42:22.237
Just let her go.

42:23.249 --> 42:26.208
So why do I need you in the equation exactly?

42:26.294 --> 42:27.660
Because it's my deal.

42:27.754 --> 42:29.996
This is my... They're my clients.

42:30.089 --> 42:31.500
For the moment, yes.

42:31.632 --> 42:33.544
Well, that's... Of course it is

42:33.634 --> 42:36.672
if you can get yourself
out of this mess you are into.

42:38.806 --> 42:41.844
Carlos. Don't take her.

42:43.019 --> 42:44.351
Enjoy nature.

43:11.130 --> 43:13.588
I really need to move out of this hotel.

43:13.716 --> 43:14.832
Look...

43:16.511 --> 43:19.470
I said I'd let you know where to meet.
What are you doing here?

43:19.597 --> 43:23.682
Pretty much the answer to any question
you ask me is Carlos Rodriguez.

43:23.810 --> 43:25.802
I warned you not to mention his name.

43:30.858 --> 43:33.191
You're frisking me for a gun?

43:33.277 --> 43:34.688
You really don't know me.

43:35.655 --> 43:37.567
When we first met,

43:37.657 --> 43:40.274
I was kind of offended
that you never seemed to trust me.

43:41.077 --> 43:43.785
All that cloak-and-dagger stuff.

43:43.913 --> 43:47.077
Oh, Ricky, Ricky, Ricky.
You know this business.

43:47.166 --> 43:48.873
You can't be too cautious.

43:49.001 --> 43:50.458
And that's what I learnt from you.

43:50.586 --> 43:55.251
Look, don't take this the wrong way,
but can we continue this tomorrow?

44:00.221 --> 44:02.008
Okay.

44:02.098 --> 44:04.260
He wants to meet you face-to-face.

44:04.642 --> 44:05.849
Who's running this import?

44:05.935 --> 44:07.801
- You or Rodriguez?
- I am.

44:07.895 --> 44:09.761
Seems like he is.

44:09.856 --> 44:11.097
I'm confused.

44:11.190 --> 44:12.931
I don't like being confused.

44:13.067 --> 44:15.480
The shipment is good and on its way.

44:15.611 --> 44:18.103
Nothing has changed for you.

44:18.197 --> 44:20.484
The money hasn't changed.
The product hasn't changed.

44:20.575 --> 44:22.282
The timings haven't changed.

44:23.452 --> 44:25.284
You're still a man of your word?

44:25.371 --> 44:26.907
I am.

44:26.998 --> 44:30.366
I should trust you more than <i>SeÃ±or</i> Rodriguez?

44:30.459 --> 44:31.540
Always.

44:36.048 --> 44:37.038
When do I get to meet him?

44:38.634 --> 44:40.170
Tomorrow.

44:40.303 --> 44:42.590
Can I go to bed now?

44:46.392 --> 44:48.679
And whatever you might think is happening,

44:49.729 --> 44:51.971
don't trust him.

44:52.064 --> 44:53.646
And don't cut me out of the deal.

44:55.484 --> 44:57.726
I said
I wanted to meet with your buyer.

44:59.447 --> 45:00.904
Not you.

45:01.282 --> 45:02.898
You know what they say,

45:02.992 --> 45:05.405
"Too many crooks spoil the broth."

45:07.413 --> 45:08.699
"Cooks".

45:09.749 --> 45:12.617
No, I think I was right.

45:18.007 --> 45:19.964
He wanted to make sure it was safe.

45:20.092 --> 45:22.175
He has no reason to fear me.

45:22.303 --> 45:25.512
I'm actually gonna make sure
that he knows and understands

45:25.598 --> 45:27.385
that I want our business to work fine.

45:27.475 --> 45:30.183
I recommend that you keep me
part of this deal, Carlos.

45:30.269 --> 45:31.259
Dad?

45:34.190 --> 45:36.273
Listen, I offer you a friendly reminder

45:36.359 --> 45:39.568
that you have about 24 hours

45:39.695 --> 45:41.857
to get me back my money.

45:42.698 --> 45:45.486
And she offers a not-so-friendly reminder

45:45.618 --> 45:47.951
- of what is at stake.
- Carlos.

45:48.287 --> 45:50.529
I'll let you know where to drop the money.

45:50.623 --> 45:53.741
Oh, and, by the way,
bring your art dealer, will you?

45:53.834 --> 45:55.416
I just want to thank him personally.

45:57.630 --> 45:59.121
What the fuck's going on?

46:00.508 --> 46:02.090
So you must be Ricky Jordan?

46:04.095 --> 46:05.802
You must be in charge.

46:05.888 --> 46:07.925
See, Donovan?

46:08.015 --> 46:10.177
He knows what this is about.

46:11.352 --> 46:13.059
Very nice meeting you.

46:20.695 --> 46:21.936
<i>Donovan's back.</i>

46:22.071 --> 46:23.607
And he's dealing here in London.

46:24.824 --> 46:26.565
Has he gone insane? Why?

46:27.326 --> 46:29.568
Domestic problems. Running low on cash.

46:30.162 --> 46:32.119
He's running around,
talking to anyone who'll listen.

46:32.248 --> 46:34.535
Christ. How do you know this?

46:36.002 --> 46:37.118
Oh!

46:37.211 --> 46:39.999
You spooks do love
your cloak-and-dagger shit, don't you?

46:40.548 --> 46:41.709
It's Donovan.

46:44.385 --> 46:46.843
- How concrete's the intel?
- Good.

46:48.347 --> 46:50.634
Excellent. Just as we planned.

46:52.518 --> 46:55.727
You mean... The sleepers?

47:02.153 --> 47:03.860
Didn't I tell you
everything would be okay?

47:03.946 --> 47:05.187
Don't be an idiot.

47:05.323 --> 47:06.985
What? This is what you wanted, isn't it?

47:07.116 --> 47:09.278
Yeah. But you know my husband.

47:09.410 --> 47:11.276
We're home free.

47:11.787 --> 47:13.278
Trust me.

47:16.834 --> 47:18.951
Thank you for the payment.

47:19.086 --> 47:22.045
What do you think?
Do you like my new establishment?

47:24.592 --> 47:25.833
No.

47:25.968 --> 47:27.800
You know, I have this thing.

47:27.887 --> 47:30.550
Every time I travel, I have to buy something.

47:30.639 --> 47:32.096
So I bought this place.

47:32.224 --> 47:35.433
A very good price
for a high-profile customer base,

47:35.853 --> 47:37.094
with all the girls thrown in.

47:37.229 --> 47:39.391
I mean, some of them
are at the end of their shelf life, but...

47:39.482 --> 47:40.518
Can we get on with this?

47:40.649 --> 47:43.733
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock. Sure.

47:45.529 --> 47:47.737
I'm sure you would like to know
that I struck a deal with Jordan.

47:48.240 --> 47:50.732
So along with this,
your debt will almost be clear.

47:50.868 --> 47:52.109
Where's my daughter?

47:52.244 --> 47:53.906
Oh, she's fine.

47:53.996 --> 47:56.113
Untouched. For the moment.

47:57.416 --> 48:00.033
Ah. Would you like to talk to her?

48:00.169 --> 48:01.660
What do you think?

48:11.931 --> 48:14.093
So you must be the guy selling the paintings.

48:23.859 --> 48:25.395
My daughter's here?

48:25.486 --> 48:26.772
Fuck off!

48:27.655 --> 48:28.566
Zoe, it's me.

48:30.741 --> 48:32.482
Oh, my God. Have you come to get me out?

48:32.618 --> 48:35.577
- It's horrible here.
- I'm doing everything I can.

48:35.704 --> 48:36.990
Except kick the door down.

48:37.832 --> 48:42.076
Zoe, I literally have a gun to my head.

48:42.962 --> 48:44.203
I'm going to get you out.

48:46.465 --> 48:48.377
Are you okay? Have they touched you?

48:48.467 --> 48:49.958
No.

48:50.052 --> 48:53.671
But they inject the girls with drugs,
and I hear all kinds of sounds.

48:53.764 --> 48:55.471
It's... It's a nightmare.

48:55.558 --> 48:56.969
I know, Zoe. I know.

48:57.935 --> 49:01.724
Dad, do you trust him, that man?

49:02.523 --> 49:03.684
Dad? Dad.

49:03.774 --> 49:04.890
Dad!

49:04.984 --> 49:06.646
Dad!

49:06.735 --> 49:07.896
Dad!

49:08.028 --> 49:10.395
I'm so happy we got
to an agreement, man.

49:10.489 --> 49:11.980
Me, too.

49:12.074 --> 49:14.612
Well, Donovan, come on. Join us.

49:14.743 --> 49:17.326
See, everything was fine. No need to worry.

49:17.413 --> 49:18.699
She's still a virgin.

49:20.291 --> 49:22.749
Oh, what?
Why are you giving me that look for?

49:22.835 --> 49:24.827
Did you see the look he just gave me?

49:24.962 --> 49:27.830
I mean, I would certainly expect
a little more gratitude from your part.

49:27.965 --> 49:30.378
I'm just helping your little daughter
to stay off drugs,

49:30.885 --> 49:33.719
which is ironic, considering where she is.

49:33.804 --> 49:35.340
Perhaps I should go.

49:35.431 --> 49:38.344
- You know how these girls are.
- It's funny.

49:40.686 --> 49:42.348
They can never get enough.

49:43.355 --> 49:46.814
Should you not pay me
the money you owe me,

49:46.901 --> 49:49.644
I might give her a little something
to ease her pain.

49:52.239 --> 49:54.856
Perhaps even one of your products.

50:04.835 --> 50:07.327
I've got a few more clients to meet.

50:07.463 --> 50:09.580
- Don't worry.
- I'm coming with you.

50:09.715 --> 50:11.331
Really, there's no need.

50:15.346 --> 50:18.930
Look, a lot's relying
on you doing yourjob fast.

50:19.016 --> 50:22.885
At the top is getting my daughter back alive.
I'm coming with you.

50:28.108 --> 50:29.974
Fifteen years since I was here last.

50:30.069 --> 50:31.731
Recognise it still?

50:31.820 --> 50:33.231
Must have changed a bit though, eh?

50:33.322 --> 50:35.154
Actually, no.

50:35.241 --> 50:36.857
The girls are a little younger though.

50:36.951 --> 50:38.408
D.D.

50:39.328 --> 50:40.694
Good God.

50:40.788 --> 50:42.404
Terry James, good to see you.

50:44.083 --> 50:47.201
I heard you'd moved abroad. How are you?

50:47.336 --> 50:48.577
I can't complain.

50:49.004 --> 50:50.791
I'm just here for a little business.

50:50.881 --> 50:52.668
Business, eh?

50:52.758 --> 50:53.919
Same old?

50:54.051 --> 50:56.043
A little more international.

50:56.178 --> 50:59.137
But nothing happening in here. Right?

50:59.723 --> 51:02.056
Just to make it crystal.

51:02.142 --> 51:04.429
I wouldn't dream of it. Seriously.

51:05.521 --> 51:07.979
This is just a social visit.

51:09.316 --> 51:10.648
It's good to see you.

51:10.734 --> 51:11.975
And you.

51:12.111 --> 51:13.773
Hello, Mr James. I'm Jamie Fullerton.

51:13.904 --> 51:15.020
I know who you are.

51:17.157 --> 51:19.240
- You know Terry James?
- Maybe.

51:20.411 --> 51:22.994
But do we ever really know someone, Jamie?

51:24.331 --> 51:25.867
You want to leave.

51:25.958 --> 51:27.915
It's just that drunk city boys come in here,

51:28.002 --> 51:31.586
- and I'll be able to sell the paintings quickly.
- Jamie!

51:31.672 --> 51:32.913
- Mimes!
- Hey.

51:33.007 --> 51:35.124
- Hi, gorgeous. How are you?
- I'm good.

51:35.217 --> 51:36.958
Mimi. Louise.

51:37.094 --> 51:38.960
Hi. I'm Suzie.

51:39.096 --> 51:40.712
Mmm. You are.

51:41.515 --> 51:44.474
Uh, Jamie, I am actually here.

51:46.979 --> 51:48.186
I'm Louise.

51:48.314 --> 51:49.725
I deduced that.

51:50.733 --> 51:52.224
Pleased to meet you.

51:52.568 --> 51:54.480
Okay. And you are?

51:54.612 --> 51:57.150
Probably best if you don't know.

51:57.531 --> 51:59.397
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that way.

51:59.491 --> 52:03.405
How did this club get Mr Donovan
to grace its presence?

52:05.956 --> 52:08.744
You chose to ignore my advice.

52:08.834 --> 52:10.575
Rodriguez?

52:10.669 --> 52:14.788
You know how it is.
Time is money. Money is happiness.

52:15.215 --> 52:16.751
You remind me of someone
who broke my heart.

52:16.884 --> 52:19.592
Really? Silly cow.

52:19.678 --> 52:21.670
Yeah. You're right.

52:21.764 --> 52:22.800
- She was...
- Ricky.

52:26.518 --> 52:28.510
It's all gonna be sweet. I can work with him.

52:29.521 --> 52:31.478
The consignment arrives
in Felixstowe this evening.

52:32.191 --> 52:33.307
It's cushty.

52:36.362 --> 52:39.400
So, darling, tell me about you.

52:39.490 --> 52:41.356
Oh, I'm just a hard-working girl.

52:42.034 --> 52:44.526
Someone who enjoys making things happen.

52:44.662 --> 52:47.120
Nice. Real interesting.

52:47.456 --> 52:49.322
Anyone else want to make things happen?

52:51.585 --> 52:54.328
You ladies all right
following me into the gents?

52:54.880 --> 52:58.715
Something about a woman
bent over in front of me just gets me going.

53:05.474 --> 53:06.931
Careful what you say.

53:07.017 --> 53:09.509
Relax. They're just hookers.

53:09.645 --> 53:11.557
I'm talking about him.

53:12.356 --> 53:13.688
I thought he was your mate.

53:13.816 --> 53:15.978
He's just selling paintings
for me, that's all.

53:16.819 --> 53:19.903
So tell me about this Rodriguez.

53:20.364 --> 53:22.026
Why would an art dealer
be interested?

53:22.116 --> 53:24.108
He's an interesting guy.

53:24.243 --> 53:25.609
Me and him are in business together.

53:25.703 --> 53:27.365
I'm into all kinds of different things.

53:27.496 --> 53:28.782
Me, too.

53:31.834 --> 53:33.746
Well, stick to art, mate.

53:34.545 --> 53:37.413
Everyone has a place in this world,

53:37.506 --> 53:39.247
and they should stick to it.

53:39.675 --> 53:41.337
Henry, you're drunk,

53:41.427 --> 53:43.339
and I know what you want
when you're like this.

53:43.429 --> 53:46.763
I know I get a bit rough.
You'll get what you want.

53:48.642 --> 53:51.134
- Fuck you!
- That's what I'm talking about.

53:51.228 --> 53:53.060
- Is everything okay?
- I can handle it.

53:53.439 --> 53:55.931
She can handle everything,
if you've got the money.

53:56.442 --> 53:58.934
You got the money?
You don't look rich enough to be in here.

53:59.445 --> 54:00.902
Come on, bitch.

54:00.988 --> 54:02.900
Let's see if I can break you
this time.

54:10.205 --> 54:13.448
You promised me nothing would happen.

54:13.542 --> 54:15.534
Now, you used to be a man of your word.

54:15.627 --> 54:17.869
- We're leaving.
- Good to see you again.

54:17.963 --> 54:19.704
You, too.

54:19.798 --> 54:22.131
And let's make this the last time.

54:26.513 --> 54:29.381
Hooking up with Louise. Sensible man.

54:29.475 --> 54:31.842
You take care of him, okay?

54:31.977 --> 54:35.141
- Jordan's a nice bloke. Speaks our language.
- What language is that?

54:35.522 --> 54:37.730
Can you make sure I get outside safe, please?

54:37.816 --> 54:40.024
- Okay.
- Nothing...

54:40.110 --> 54:41.271
Nothing meant by it.

54:41.361 --> 54:43.944
You're meant to be selling my paintings fast.

54:44.072 --> 54:45.108
That's it.

54:48.160 --> 54:50.698
Alex, let's talk Rembrandts.

54:58.545 --> 55:00.161
Cheers. Thank you.

55:06.804 --> 55:07.840
Hi.

55:08.889 --> 55:11.506
No, I can't tonight.

55:11.600 --> 55:12.716
Sure.

55:16.980 --> 55:18.016
Your boyfriend?

55:20.400 --> 55:24.110
Oh, come on. You know what I do by now.

55:24.196 --> 55:25.937
What you do is of no concern to me.

55:28.283 --> 55:31.276
I only do it part-time,
if that makes it okay.

55:31.370 --> 55:32.986
I won't bore you with my story.

55:35.666 --> 55:38.204
I brought you back here
'cause you seem like a nice guy.

55:41.505 --> 55:43.371
You stepped in. Us girls like that.

55:43.507 --> 55:45.544
No one deserves to be talked to like that.

55:47.052 --> 55:48.293
Whatever they do.

55:48.720 --> 55:50.552
I'm used to it.

55:50.639 --> 55:53.427
Men treating me like shit.

55:53.517 --> 55:55.008
From my dad onwards.

55:55.602 --> 55:57.218
I'm sorry to hear that.

55:57.729 --> 55:59.015
Don't be.

55:59.106 --> 56:00.972
He was an asshole.
I got out as soon as I could.

56:01.567 --> 56:05.561
Fifteen. Nothing in my back pocket,
midnight train to King's Cross.

56:07.239 --> 56:08.229
Guess what happened next.

56:09.825 --> 56:10.986
I can imagine.

56:12.411 --> 56:13.572
Young girls.

56:14.746 --> 56:15.953
It's tough.

56:22.212 --> 56:23.544
Sorry. I didn't mean to...

56:23.630 --> 56:25.337
No. It's okay.

56:25.465 --> 56:27.297
I want to hear your story.

56:27.384 --> 56:31.253
It's one that's been told 1,000 times before,

56:31.346 --> 56:32.757
and you look like you're hurting.

56:33.599 --> 56:35.682
- Talk to me.
- It's nothing.

56:38.604 --> 56:41.017
It's just some business
I need to sort out, that's all.

56:41.106 --> 56:42.267
You have a daughter, is that it?

56:50.449 --> 56:52.406
You know, Louise...

56:53.118 --> 56:54.404
I really should go.

56:55.370 --> 56:56.406
You should talk.

56:58.874 --> 56:59.910
I'd rather not.

57:01.209 --> 57:02.199
And that's the problem.

57:04.546 --> 57:07.209
Sometimes you've got to let stuff out
to move on.

57:09.885 --> 57:11.251
You have an honest face.

57:12.596 --> 57:15.088
That's not what I normally get told.

57:20.896 --> 57:25.266
My wife ran off with my business partner,

57:27.444 --> 57:29.401
taking most of my money.

57:30.864 --> 57:34.278
And I then discovered
that my daughter had dropped out of school,

57:36.286 --> 57:38.528
started using class-A drugs,

57:40.499 --> 57:42.365
which I supply

57:44.711 --> 57:46.577
for a living.

57:53.178 --> 57:54.419
My wife...

58:00.310 --> 58:01.596
I need to get her back.

58:12.656 --> 58:13.942
Andrew Hathaway.

58:14.074 --> 58:15.781
- Right.
- Thank you.

58:15.909 --> 58:18.993
So, what couldn't wait till the morning?

58:21.373 --> 58:23.456
Things are moving fast on the Donovan front.

58:23.583 --> 58:26.075
There's a big consignment
of cocaine coming in from Colombia.

58:26.169 --> 58:27.910
It lands tonight. Felixstowe.

58:28.380 --> 58:29.461
Where did you hear about this?

58:29.840 --> 58:30.921
What does it matter?

58:31.008 --> 58:33.375
I want it intercepted
before it hits the marketplace.

58:33.885 --> 58:35.171
Why not just let it run?

58:35.262 --> 58:37.254
Then we can set up, follow the shipments.

58:37.347 --> 58:39.054
Donovan's been cut out of the loop.

58:39.433 --> 58:41.174
Andy...

58:41.309 --> 58:42.891
This can't just be...

58:45.063 --> 58:47.350
- Parker, give us a moment.
- Sir.

58:52.904 --> 58:55.396
This can't just be about Donovan.

58:55.490 --> 58:56.901
We have to look at the bigger picture here.

58:57.034 --> 58:59.242
Donovan is the bigger picture.

58:59.619 --> 59:02.487
I appreciate
how much you want to get him,

59:03.123 --> 59:04.830
and you have the power to do that,

59:04.916 --> 59:08.284
but that power was given so that
we could bring down an entire network,

59:08.378 --> 59:09.869
not just exact some kind of revenge.

59:10.505 --> 59:12.542
Donovan set up this deal.
I know that for certain.

59:12.632 --> 59:14.919
But for some reason
he's been cut out of the loop.

59:15.052 --> 59:16.588
You'll be wasting resources.

59:16.678 --> 59:19.136
You'll be tracking dogsbodies
who are worth nothing.

59:19.264 --> 59:21.972
So, who else is involved?

59:22.434 --> 59:24.676
I told you, my budget's strained.

59:24.770 --> 59:26.682
I can't just action this without...

59:26.772 --> 59:29.264
If we snap up this load,
there'll be a fallout.

59:29.357 --> 59:31.223
If I'm right, that's when
we get some really big heads.

59:31.735 --> 59:34.899
- It's not just about Donovan.
- You know more.

59:36.865 --> 59:40.950
Christ, you have managed
to get someone close to him, haven't you?

59:41.036 --> 59:42.618
- Who?
- Enough said, I think.

59:42.954 --> 59:47.164
Tell me. This undercover operation
was set up for the both of us.

59:48.043 --> 59:51.002
Peter, I've managed to work
in the secrets business for most of my life.

59:51.129 --> 59:52.540
There's a reason for that.

59:52.631 --> 59:55.374
Now, let's just seize this shipment
before it hits the streets.

59:55.509 --> 59:56.625
Yes?

01:00:07.521 --> 01:00:09.353
<i>Are we go?</i>

01:00:09.981 --> 01:00:11.597
Are you sure about this?

01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:14.308
We can still follow them
and map their network.

01:00:16.071 --> 01:00:18.529
Control, are we go?

01:00:19.324 --> 01:00:20.656
Which do you prefer?

01:00:20.742 --> 01:00:24.486
A bowl of whitebait or one big juicy salmon?

01:00:26.581 --> 01:00:27.742
It's a go.

01:00:27.874 --> 01:00:28.864
Go, go, go.

01:00:30.001 --> 01:00:32.368
<i>Alpha team moving in.</i>

01:00:32.754 --> 01:00:33.995
<i>Breaching the ship.</i>

01:00:41.012 --> 01:00:42.844
<i>Bravo team into the berth.</i>

01:00:51.022 --> 01:00:52.012
<i>Moving down.</i>

01:00:56.153 --> 01:00:57.519
<i>Moving into the hold.</i>

01:01:01.867 --> 01:01:02.857
<i>- Get back!
- Stand back!</i>

01:01:09.875 --> 01:01:11.741
<i>Entering 3A crew berth.</i>

01:01:25.348 --> 01:01:26.805
<i>Product is confirmed.</i>

01:01:28.018 --> 01:01:30.226
Now we sit back and wait for the fireworks.

01:01:35.525 --> 01:01:36.766
Morning.

01:01:44.034 --> 01:01:45.275
What happened?

01:01:47.287 --> 01:01:48.994
You passed out.

01:01:49.122 --> 01:01:51.159
Just before I went to kiss you.

01:01:52.042 --> 01:01:54.625
What? Really?

01:01:57.547 --> 01:01:59.379
Don't worry. Nothing happened.

01:02:01.843 --> 01:02:03.584
I don't know what did happen.

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.712
Exhaustion, I'd say.

01:02:06.223 --> 01:02:07.839
Seems like you're under a lot of stress
at the moment.

01:02:08.725 --> 01:02:11.183
Got to give your body and your mind
a break every once in a while.

01:02:11.269 --> 01:02:14.137
- And you say this because...
- I'm a hooker.

01:02:15.482 --> 01:02:18.020
And people pay me to take their stress away.

01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:21.693
Sometimes with my body.
Sometimes with my mind.

01:02:23.657 --> 01:02:26.240
A simple chat can be better than a hand job.

01:02:26.368 --> 01:02:28.155
Yeah.

01:02:28.245 --> 01:02:30.862
Well, uh...

01:02:32.290 --> 01:02:33.371
Thank you.

01:02:35.961 --> 01:02:37.202
For the coffee.

01:02:37.337 --> 01:02:39.374
I'm gonna take a shower.

01:02:39.464 --> 01:02:42.002
Don't worry.
That's not me fishing for business.

01:02:46.012 --> 01:02:48.174
Hmm. Ooh.

01:03:03.989 --> 01:03:05.321
That feels like a gun.

01:03:07.325 --> 01:03:11.444
The Rodriguez deal.
The whole shipment got busted last night.

01:03:12.163 --> 01:03:16.783
It's all gone. Coke. My money. Everything.

01:03:17.877 --> 01:03:18.913
So?

01:03:19.045 --> 01:03:22.880
You got cut out of the deal,
so you screwed it up for us.

01:03:23.008 --> 01:03:27.878
Look, if someone was tipped off,
they'd let the drugs run. You know that.

01:03:30.348 --> 01:03:32.681
Enough of your silver tongue.

01:03:34.436 --> 01:03:36.052
Time for some payback.

01:03:36.187 --> 01:03:38.224
Look, stop trying to be something you're not.

01:03:38.315 --> 01:03:41.683
Before I ask why you're all here,

01:03:41.776 --> 01:03:44.143
may I just point out I am holding an M16.

01:03:46.865 --> 01:03:49.733
Be a good girl. Put the gun away, love.

01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:53.531
Okay, okay.

01:03:54.039 --> 01:03:57.248
I've put millions into this deal.

01:03:57.334 --> 01:03:58.324
My clients prepaid.

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:02.457
Your clients prepaid you?

01:04:03.590 --> 01:04:06.298
Most of them. Including some yardies.

01:04:08.595 --> 01:04:10.712
Now, that's not my problem.

01:04:11.348 --> 01:04:13.840
You and Carlos dealt direct, remember?

01:04:14.726 --> 01:04:15.716
Yeah, but...

01:04:15.852 --> 01:04:18.014
Yeah, but...
No buts, Ricky.

01:04:20.023 --> 01:04:24.017
I needed some clout,
a big name to get leeway with them.

01:04:24.110 --> 01:04:25.396
They're gonna think you owe them $3 million.

01:04:25.528 --> 01:04:26.894
Me? I don't owe anything.

01:04:28.448 --> 01:04:32.567
As far as they're concerned,
it's still your deal, so, yes, you owe them.

01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:37.117
Can you just not point that knife in my face?

01:04:37.248 --> 01:04:39.365
Carlos will still want his money from you,

01:04:39.501 --> 01:04:43.120
and believe me,
he's not keen on partners who stiff him.

01:04:53.681 --> 01:04:54.762
That's where you come in.

01:04:57.102 --> 01:05:00.766
That's where I come in again.
That's what rattles me about all this.

01:05:00.855 --> 01:05:05.725
You're all so quick to cut me out of
the deal, thinking it's all so easy.

01:05:05.819 --> 01:05:08.607
"What do we need Donovan for?"

01:05:08.696 --> 01:05:10.813
Then, when the S-H-one-T hits the fan,

01:05:10.949 --> 01:05:14.943
suddenly it's, "Oh, where's Donovan?
He needs to sort this out for us."

01:05:17.997 --> 01:05:19.329
Okay.

01:05:19.958 --> 01:05:21.950
Look, um...

01:05:23.795 --> 01:05:25.286
What if I can, um...

01:05:28.216 --> 01:05:32.176
What if I can get you some top-grade heroin
direct from Afghanistan?

01:05:32.262 --> 01:05:37.223
What? Your solution to all this
is for me to buy more gear?

01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:39.512
We're all past the point of no return here.

01:05:40.103 --> 01:05:43.267
Tomorrow, I'll be dead. You'll be dead.

01:05:43.398 --> 01:05:45.481
Nobody defaults on the Colombian.

01:05:46.693 --> 01:05:49.310
How can you guarantee
I'm not just throwing good money after bad?

01:05:49.404 --> 01:05:51.737
Because this is my deal here.

01:05:51.823 --> 01:05:53.815
I'll have everything riding on this.

01:05:54.451 --> 01:05:56.067
What do you normally buy H for?

01:05:56.202 --> 01:05:58.319
Fourteen to 20 a key via Amsterdam.

01:05:58.455 --> 01:05:59.366
How does ten per kilo sound?

01:05:59.831 --> 01:06:01.288
Cheaper.

01:06:01.416 --> 01:06:03.703
You do this,
and you can recoup all your losses.

01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:06.831
What about the yardies?

01:06:08.006 --> 01:06:09.963
They're grown-ups.
They'll sit around the table.

01:06:10.091 --> 01:06:13.050
Not exactly. You need to speak to them.

01:06:13.178 --> 01:06:14.794
Maybe cut them in.

01:06:14.888 --> 01:06:17.221
Talk to the yardies?
Love of God, why would I do that?

01:06:17.348 --> 01:06:18.839
Why would you do that?

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:24.682
Because you may be
fucking back off to the Bahamas,

01:06:24.814 --> 01:06:26.851
but some of us have got to stay here

01:06:27.901 --> 01:06:29.312
and stay living here.

01:06:29.861 --> 01:06:33.104
Right. Now you've got your business sorted,

01:06:33.198 --> 01:06:35.861
everyone drop your wallets on the floor.

01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:37.108
What?

01:06:37.869 --> 01:06:40.862
My new lock is going to be expensive.

01:06:46.294 --> 01:06:47.705
Fucking day I'm having!

01:07:02.519 --> 01:07:03.760
Where did you get that?

01:07:05.563 --> 01:07:06.644
I love guns.

01:07:08.107 --> 01:07:11.942
- Saved your bacon.
- You did. Thank you, again.

01:07:12.070 --> 01:07:14.608
So we're business partners now.

01:07:15.073 --> 01:07:16.189
And how do you work that out?

01:07:17.909 --> 01:07:20.617
You're going to need some up-front cash
for this deal.

01:07:20.745 --> 01:07:25.160
- I can help you out.
- That doesn't make you a business partner.

01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:27.333
You're more of a middleman.

01:07:27.794 --> 01:07:30.161
I'll overlook the sexism.

01:07:30.255 --> 01:07:32.087
But being a middleman,
isn't that what you are?

01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:35.924
Giving the money to the suppliers,
handing the drugs to the buyers?

01:07:36.261 --> 01:07:38.503
- Cute.
- What, me or my poetry?

01:07:38.638 --> 01:07:39.719
Both.

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:45.968
- So, are we going to go find these yardies?
- We?

01:07:46.104 --> 01:07:48.141
Who else is going to protect you?

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:50.521
Stu?

01:07:50.608 --> 01:07:53.191
Oh, you're not going to ask me
if we're nearly there yet again, are you?

01:07:54.028 --> 01:07:55.940
Do you think we should give the money back?

01:07:56.281 --> 01:07:57.442
Make our peace?

01:07:57.532 --> 01:08:00.821
Oh, ha-ha, very funny.
I never realised you had a sense of humour.

01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:03.744
- I'm serious.
- Yeah. No, I'm fucking serious.

01:08:03.871 --> 01:08:05.988
Why the fuck would we want
to give the money back?

01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:08.995
Because he's never
going to stop looking for us.

01:08:09.085 --> 01:08:12.328
Trust me. He's got enough
to occupy his mind. We're safe.

01:08:12.714 --> 01:08:15.172
I'd rather not spend the rest of my life
running and hiding.

01:08:15.633 --> 01:08:18.341
Yeah, well, I can see you're not dealing
with the stress very well.

01:08:18.428 --> 01:08:19.885
Fuck you!

01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:21.883
Did you do this for me orjust for the money?

01:08:21.973 --> 01:08:25.307
For you, of course. But think about it.
What are we going to live on?

01:08:37.904 --> 01:08:40.022
Louise said you and I should talk.

01:08:40.116 --> 01:08:42.779
All this cloak-and-dagger stuff,
it's like being in a movie.

01:08:42.868 --> 01:08:44.656
You have to calm down, you know.

01:08:45.330 --> 01:08:48.868
This isn't a game.
You've met Rodriguez, remember.

01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:50.620
This is all very real, and we're expendable.

01:08:51.586 --> 01:08:54.420
Okay, okay. Point made.

01:08:54.505 --> 01:08:56.667
I haven't been able to shift
any more of your paintings.

01:08:56.799 --> 01:08:59.131
It's not the paintings
I want to speak to you about.

01:09:02.095 --> 01:09:06.055
These associates, friends, contacts you have,

01:09:07.602 --> 01:09:10.640
are they into anything besides art? I mean...

01:09:10.772 --> 01:09:12.638
You mean, the kind of things you're into?

01:09:13.316 --> 01:09:14.682
Something like that.

01:09:15.151 --> 01:09:16.517
Depends on what.

01:09:19.197 --> 01:09:21.654
I've got something new going,

01:09:21.741 --> 01:09:24.073
and I'm looking for guys to shift H.

01:09:24.493 --> 01:09:26.326
Top-grade Afghan H.

01:09:26.453 --> 01:09:28.161
Way below current wholesale.

01:09:28.288 --> 01:09:29.654
What about Jordan?

01:09:29.791 --> 01:09:32.783
- What about Jordan? I'm here talking to you.
- Okay, okay.

01:09:33.461 --> 01:09:35.292
How much below wholesale?

01:09:35.421 --> 01:09:37.787
$10,000 per key.

01:09:38.549 --> 01:09:40.666
- How many you got?
- A lot. Over 1,000.

01:09:40.801 --> 01:09:42.009
A thousand?

01:09:42.886 --> 01:09:43.923
So?

01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:47.924
My contacts, they're gonna wanna know
how it's coming in.

01:09:48.518 --> 01:09:52.386
If they wanna know, they're not the guys
you should be dealing with.

01:09:52.479 --> 01:09:55.223
But you'll tell me though, right?

01:09:55.316 --> 01:09:58.525
Strictly bank transfers in advance.

01:09:58.611 --> 01:10:00.898
One pick-up here in the UK.

01:10:04.117 --> 01:10:06.029
Does this mean we're partners?

01:10:09.997 --> 01:10:12.910
Vicky! What you doing? Who you calling?

01:10:13.501 --> 01:10:15.333
I was just calling Zoe.
I'm worried about her.

01:10:15.837 --> 01:10:18.796
Yeah? Well, that's funny.
You never gave a shit about her before.

01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:21.290
I wanna go home.

01:10:21.426 --> 01:10:23.918
- Why, when you know we can't?
- I'm stressed.

01:10:24.387 --> 01:10:26.379
Every little sound,
I think it's someone trying to kill me.

01:10:26.472 --> 01:10:27.883
I'm... I'm scared.

01:10:27.974 --> 01:10:29.306
We're not giving the money back.

01:10:29.976 --> 01:10:31.683
That's what this is about, isn't it?

01:10:31.811 --> 01:10:34.349
The money.
It's not me you want. It's the money.

01:10:34.439 --> 01:10:36.897
Look, I want you, yeah?

01:10:36.983 --> 01:10:39.726
And if it makes you happy,
we'll give some of the money back.

01:10:39.861 --> 01:10:43.480
- Best of both worlds.
- If it's me you want, let's give it all back.

01:10:45.199 --> 01:10:46.940
I think we both know you made me do that.

01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:50.695
You fucking bastard.
Wait till he finds out what you did.

01:10:50.788 --> 01:10:52.950
Yeah, but, Vicky,
he ain't gonna find out, is he?

01:10:53.374 --> 01:10:54.490
Is he?

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:12.724
You can take the gun.
Anything else, you've got to pay for.

01:11:19.108 --> 01:11:20.644
You Donovan?

01:11:20.777 --> 01:11:23.269
Well, I'm the only white
man in the room, so...

01:11:25.782 --> 01:11:26.818
Where's my fucking money?

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:28.986
Whoa.

01:11:30.453 --> 01:11:32.194
I'm not too fussed with health and safety,

01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:35.531
but that's a very big gun
for such a small room.

01:11:35.625 --> 01:11:36.706
Don't be worrying about who I'm gonna shoot

01:11:36.793 --> 01:11:37.874
and who I'm not gonna shoot.

01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:39.201
I said, where's my fucking money?

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:44.965
Your money went toward a cocaine shipment.

01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:49.753
That shipment is now in the hands
of Her Majesty's government.

01:11:49.889 --> 01:11:51.130
It's gone.

01:11:53.643 --> 01:11:55.384
Well, that kind of means
that's someone's fault.

01:11:55.895 --> 01:11:58.763
And that someone is you.
So say goodbye, Donovan.

01:11:58.898 --> 01:12:00.685
It's gone, but not lost.

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:04.769
- Wait. Let's hear what he has to say.
- What?

01:12:04.862 --> 01:12:07.730
Can't have come all this way
just to give us bad news.

01:12:07.865 --> 01:12:09.731
- You trying to tell me what to do?
- Advising.

01:12:09.826 --> 01:12:11.362
Which is what you pay me for.

01:12:11.452 --> 01:12:14.741
And, as your adviser,
I'm saying let's hear him out.

01:12:14.831 --> 01:12:17.699
You can still pull the trigger
if you don't like what you hear.

01:12:19.627 --> 01:12:21.960
He's like my adviser.

01:12:22.046 --> 01:12:24.754
He's made me realise
that sometimes you make more money

01:12:24.841 --> 01:12:27.834
if you don't act but listen.

01:12:27.927 --> 01:12:29.463
Sometimes.

01:12:30.429 --> 01:12:32.762
I've got two propositions for you.

01:12:32.849 --> 01:12:35.842
The first one gets back
some of the money you lost.

01:12:35.935 --> 01:12:37.016
Some?

01:12:37.103 --> 01:12:38.890
It'll be from the people
got caught with the shipment.

01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:40.141
They screwed up, not me.

01:12:40.231 --> 01:12:42.644
- I don't give a fuck!
- Let him talk, boss.

01:12:54.328 --> 01:12:56.661
I tell you where they are.

01:12:56.747 --> 01:12:58.955
You take whatever they have,
and if you feel like it,

01:12:59.041 --> 01:13:00.703
you can teach them a lesson, too.

01:13:06.299 --> 01:13:08.461
So we're liking that idea.

01:13:08.551 --> 01:13:10.417
And the second proposition?

01:13:11.262 --> 01:13:13.379
That's what the girl's here for, right? RB.

01:13:16.559 --> 01:13:18.391
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

01:13:18.519 --> 01:13:21.102
Fuck, girl. You're a fighter, innit!

01:13:22.189 --> 01:13:24.272
Ain't nothing gonna feel better
than muzzling you, bitch.

01:13:24.358 --> 01:13:28.068
Not even grade-A heroin at $10,000 per kilo?

01:13:28.404 --> 01:13:29.895
- Source?
- Afghanistan.

01:13:29.989 --> 01:13:33.073
- Delivered how?
- You're not the guy in charge.

01:13:33.159 --> 01:13:35.902
- I'm the guy who's keeping you alive.
- By ship.

01:13:36.037 --> 01:13:37.994
- The south coast.
- How much?

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:40.367
As much as you can take.

01:13:40.458 --> 01:13:41.994
We'll take 200 kilos.

01:13:43.586 --> 01:13:46.203
- At eight K.
- I believe I said ten K.

01:13:46.631 --> 01:13:48.338
Hey!

01:13:48.424 --> 01:13:50.507
You're too quick to talk.

01:13:50.593 --> 01:13:52.300
You should listen to my adviser.

01:13:53.262 --> 01:13:54.844
Trust me.

01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:57.676
Nine. Payment beforehand.

01:14:02.605 --> 01:14:05.313
This deal gets fucked up, then so do you.

01:14:06.108 --> 01:14:07.815
And Lara Croft.

01:14:07.902 --> 01:14:11.361
We'll need to know where to recoup our loss
and the new merchandise.

01:14:11.489 --> 01:14:13.025
No problem.

01:14:13.115 --> 01:14:14.981
Let us shake on it then?

01:14:28.881 --> 01:14:31.168
The cash room's through there.

01:14:51.779 --> 01:14:54.487
- Zoe, keep away from the door!
- Dad?

01:14:54.615 --> 01:14:55.981
Zoe, come on!

01:14:57.034 --> 01:14:58.525
I need to get
the other girls out of here.

01:14:58.619 --> 01:15:00.611
- I'll get Zoe out, come back and help you.
- I'll be fine.

01:15:01.664 --> 01:15:03.371
Look me up sometime.

01:15:19.181 --> 01:15:21.844
So this is a step down.

01:15:26.856 --> 01:15:28.518
We have a good view of London.

01:15:31.068 --> 01:15:32.354
It's safe.

01:15:33.529 --> 01:15:36.067
- No one will find us here.
- Not even the owner?

01:15:37.408 --> 01:15:39.741
He won't be coming back.

01:15:39.827 --> 01:15:41.363
But he won't mind.

01:15:42.496 --> 01:15:44.453
Oh, geez. That makes this creepy.

01:15:51.964 --> 01:15:55.628
I'm so happy to have you back.

01:15:55.718 --> 01:15:57.630
Yeah.

01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:01.885
I'm kinda keen never to meet
anyone you work with ever again.

01:16:02.558 --> 01:16:04.390
I'll make sure that never happens.

01:16:08.731 --> 01:16:10.142
There's, um...

01:16:11.358 --> 01:16:13.099
A clean bed through there.

01:16:13.194 --> 01:16:14.560
Food in the fridge.

01:16:14.653 --> 01:16:16.736
A dead man's bed. Nice.

01:16:16.822 --> 01:16:18.905
You can use the sofa.

01:16:19.658 --> 01:16:21.115
Wait, are you going somewhere?

01:16:22.828 --> 01:16:24.865
It's best not to ask questions.

01:16:24.997 --> 01:16:27.239
Just know this.

01:16:27.333 --> 01:16:31.452
I'm trying to sort everything out
so we can get on with living our lives.

01:16:31.545 --> 01:16:34.879
And I suppose you're going
to handcuff me or something?

01:16:34.965 --> 01:16:36.752
Why would I do that?

01:16:36.842 --> 01:16:39.084
You know, so I don't run off.

01:16:40.554 --> 01:16:43.638
After what you've seen and been through,

01:16:43.724 --> 01:16:45.056
do you want to run off?

01:16:47.978 --> 01:16:49.094
Come here.

01:16:53.109 --> 01:16:54.270
My Zoe.

01:16:59.615 --> 01:17:01.322
I'll make you some tea.

01:17:04.453 --> 01:17:06.285
I'd like to see Louise again.

01:17:06.413 --> 01:17:07.369
She was kinda cool.

01:17:09.041 --> 01:17:10.703
You should see her with an M16.

01:17:14.463 --> 01:17:17.627
- You are checking the currency rates?
- No, it's not my sort of thing.

01:17:17.758 --> 01:17:18.748
I am surprised,

01:17:18.884 --> 01:17:21.797
considering that you have
$60 million to spend.

01:17:23.055 --> 01:17:25.468
I thought that you would be very interested.

01:17:26.725 --> 01:17:27.806
Who are you?

01:17:28.602 --> 01:17:32.687
I was born in a small village
outside of Nola, in Central Africa.

01:17:33.732 --> 01:17:36.975
At the age of eight,
I was stolen from my mother

01:17:37.069 --> 01:17:39.277
and shown how to use a gun.

01:17:40.489 --> 01:17:43.357
I killed someone for the first time
on my ninth birthday.

01:17:44.243 --> 01:17:48.658
At the age of 13, against my will,
I lost my virginity to a nun.

01:17:49.707 --> 01:17:52.666
Two years later, so that would make me 15,

01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:55.952
I killed the man
who took me away from my mother.

01:17:56.964 --> 01:18:00.583
For the last ten years,
I've been paid to find, and sometimes kill,

01:18:00.676 --> 01:18:03.168
people from all over the world.

01:18:05.931 --> 01:18:07.513
You are one of those peoples.

01:18:11.645 --> 01:18:13.261
What is the problem?

01:18:13.355 --> 01:18:15.517
You asked me who I was,

01:18:15.608 --> 01:18:18.692
or maybe that was
too much information for you.

01:18:18.777 --> 01:18:22.396
Well, at least now
you can make an informed decision

01:18:22.489 --> 01:18:24.446
on what you would like to do next.

01:18:25.284 --> 01:18:28.493
Look, whatever he's paying you...

01:18:28.579 --> 01:18:31.071
...I'll double it.
Fuck it, ten times more.

01:18:31.207 --> 01:18:32.994
I forgot some fundamental information.

01:18:33.083 --> 01:18:36.247
I am a professional, not a mercenary.

01:18:37.046 --> 01:18:38.287
Ten times more the money, man.

01:18:38.422 --> 01:18:41.130
My reputation is worth so much more.

01:18:42.593 --> 01:18:46.633
I will not accept a new contract
until I have completed the active one.

01:18:46.722 --> 01:18:48.384
That's a stupid fucking rule.

01:18:49.391 --> 01:18:53.385
The only thing that is stupid,
my friend, is you.

01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:15.498
<i>The money is back in your bank account.</i>

01:19:15.626 --> 01:19:18.334
<i>They had spent some.
And naturally, I have taken out my fee.</i>

01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:20.958
Of course. How are they?

01:19:22.007 --> 01:19:24.499
Your wife is

01:19:24.593 --> 01:19:25.879
crazy.

01:19:25.970 --> 01:19:28.337
<i>- She had to be to marry me.</i>
- Hmm.

01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:29.841
And your accountant friend,

01:19:29.932 --> 01:19:32.140
well, he's enjoying the view.

01:19:34.061 --> 01:19:36.974
- Did he try to do a deal?
- Yeah, they always do.

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:39.521
Can I talk with her?

01:19:48.826 --> 01:19:50.033
I'm so sorry.

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:51.241
I'm sure you are.

01:19:51.870 --> 01:19:54.863
I am. I... I didn't want to...

01:19:54.957 --> 01:19:56.289
Why, Vicky?

01:19:57.960 --> 01:19:59.371
You had the money before.

01:19:59.503 --> 01:20:01.119
- What?
<i>- So I know it wasn't about that.</i>

01:20:01.213 --> 01:20:03.455
That was his idea.
I wanted to give the money back.

01:20:03.590 --> 01:20:05.957
<i>- I just wanted...</i>
- You wanted him.

01:20:06.593 --> 01:20:07.629
Well, now you have him

01:20:07.761 --> 01:20:09.753
<i>for as long as he can last.</i>

01:20:11.348 --> 01:20:13.840
That's it? You're... You're just gonna
leave me here with nothing?

01:20:14.643 --> 01:20:16.430
That's the general idea.

01:20:17.896 --> 01:20:19.512
I wanna come back.

01:20:19.606 --> 01:20:21.222
<i>Why?</i>

01:20:21.317 --> 01:20:25.231
This was a fucking stupid idea.
I shouldn't have. I just...

01:20:26.071 --> 01:20:27.903
<i>I just want things back the way they were.</i>

01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:31.028
Oh, by that, you mean rarely seeing Zoe
and never seeing me?

01:20:32.661 --> 01:20:34.618
<i>Give me a reason to let you back.</i>

01:20:36.498 --> 01:20:38.990
Do you know what? Fuck you.

01:20:39.668 --> 01:20:41.955
<i>I didn't wanna marry you,
but then you got me pregnant.</i>

01:20:42.087 --> 01:20:46.798
I didn't even wanna sleep with you,
but I was too drunk and high to say no.

01:20:46.884 --> 01:20:49.592
<i>If you're asking me what I want,</i>

01:20:49.678 --> 01:20:51.544
<i>I want my life back.</i>

01:20:52.431 --> 01:20:53.421
Before I met you.

01:20:53.515 --> 01:20:57.179
Before a kid ruined my fucking chance
at making a name for myself in the world.

01:20:57.853 --> 01:20:59.890
<i>My name, not Mrs Donovan,</i>

01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:01.937
<i>not every fucking door opened for me</i>

01:21:02.024 --> 01:21:03.856
<i>because people are
too scared of my husband.</i>

01:21:03.984 --> 01:21:06.647
<i>- That's what I fucking want.</i>
- Is that Mum?

01:21:07.154 --> 01:21:10.192
- Go back inside.
- Does she want to talk to me?

01:21:12.409 --> 01:21:13.525
Zoe's here.

01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:15.777
Daddy's little girl.

01:21:15.871 --> 01:21:17.737
<i>Do you want to talk to her?</i>

01:21:18.332 --> 01:21:21.291
None of this would've happened
if it wasn't for that little bitch.

01:21:23.212 --> 01:21:24.874
Go back inside. It's cold.

01:21:32.388 --> 01:21:34.675
You're gonna get everything you ever wanted.

01:21:36.517 --> 01:21:37.598
Goodbye, Vicky.

01:21:38.185 --> 01:21:39.551
Go to hell.

01:21:39.937 --> 01:21:41.053
Maybe I will.

01:21:49.947 --> 01:21:51.609
What would you like me to do next?

01:21:55.202 --> 01:21:56.409
Cut her loose.

01:21:58.205 --> 01:21:59.286
But he stays.

01:22:09.967 --> 01:22:12.254
To keep your friend alive a little longer,

01:22:12.344 --> 01:22:14.586
I suggest you lie in front of him.

01:22:16.056 --> 01:22:18.423
It's to shield the water.

01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:24.478
I'll fucking destroy you,
you fucking bitch!

01:22:27.860 --> 01:22:32.070
Come back! Come back! Don't leave me!

01:22:36.410 --> 01:22:37.992
<i>I just
want to get my daughter back.</i>

01:22:39.246 --> 01:22:41.238
Is that why we're here?

01:22:41.331 --> 01:22:43.368
No, this is business.

01:22:43.459 --> 01:22:46.076
The heroin's coming in here?

01:22:46.170 --> 01:22:49.709
There's constant loading, unloading.

01:22:49.798 --> 01:22:52.165
We'll be low-key.

01:22:52.259 --> 01:22:56.344
And I've paid off security
to turn a blind eye, in and out.

01:22:56.430 --> 01:23:00.094
Have you ever used these
guys before? They're Russians, right?

01:23:00.184 --> 01:23:03.222
It's the first run for me.

01:23:03.312 --> 01:23:05.929
Well, this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

01:23:08.108 --> 01:23:10.020
Maybe. Maybe not.

01:23:11.653 --> 01:23:13.565
After all this,

01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:16.238
who knows what the future will hold?

01:23:16.325 --> 01:23:19.068
My investors,
they wanna know when.

01:23:20.287 --> 01:23:21.698
It's happening tonight.

01:23:21.788 --> 01:23:23.905
Fuck, really? Then I should...

01:23:23.999 --> 01:23:28.369
You should go tell your investors
they're about to become stupidly bloody rich.

01:23:28.712 --> 01:23:31.921
I'm gonna contact some people,
make things start happening.

01:23:32.007 --> 01:23:33.623
Okay, Bogart.

01:24:04.414 --> 01:24:06.406
What the fuck are you doing here?

01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:07.991
Bravo, Jamie.

01:24:08.085 --> 01:24:10.577
You turned out to be an exceptional choice.

01:24:10.671 --> 01:24:12.458
I thought we was never supposed to meet.

01:24:12.548 --> 01:24:14.255
I thought we should.

01:24:14.341 --> 01:24:16.628
After all, things are moving quickly now,
aren't they?

01:24:16.718 --> 01:24:18.380
This isn't how it works.

01:24:21.390 --> 01:24:22.380
Jamie.

01:24:24.726 --> 01:24:27.639
You, the recruiting,

01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:29.971
the undercover work
you've done for the past three years,

01:24:30.065 --> 01:24:31.852
it was all about getting Donovan.

01:24:32.484 --> 01:24:35.352
So once you get Donovan,
what happens to me?

01:24:35.487 --> 01:24:38.150
You couldn't have joined the Met,
Jamie, not with your record.

01:24:38.282 --> 01:24:40.615
So all this time you've just strung me along.

01:24:40.742 --> 01:24:42.608
Now it's bye-bye, Jamie,
thanks for the application.

01:24:43.328 --> 01:24:45.035
And what now?

01:24:45.581 --> 01:24:47.197
I can't exactly become a
covert source, can I?

01:24:47.624 --> 01:24:51.083
No, you can't, Jamie. But what you can do,

01:24:51.169 --> 01:24:53.536
is you can tell me what Donovan's planning.

01:24:56.508 --> 01:24:57.624
I don't know.

01:24:58.969 --> 01:25:00.301
You don't know?

01:25:00.762 --> 01:25:03.300
I only knew about the coke deal
from being in the club.

01:25:03.390 --> 01:25:05.757
- Oh.
- Just talk.

01:25:05.892 --> 01:25:07.758
He won't tell me anything.

01:25:08.770 --> 01:25:11.228
Is that right, Jamie?

01:25:11.690 --> 01:25:12.851
Is that right?

01:25:29.625 --> 01:25:31.742
Oh, you always were very good, LouLou.

01:25:31.835 --> 01:25:33.701
Don't call me that.

01:25:33.795 --> 01:25:36.208
So, sleeping with the enemy, eh?

01:25:36.298 --> 01:25:39.041
A leopard never changes its spots.

01:25:39.134 --> 01:25:40.750
Full of clichÃ©s, as usual.

01:25:40.844 --> 01:25:44.212
Did you have to put your stiletto
all the way through Agent Harper's foot?

01:25:44.306 --> 01:25:46.218
You know he's out of action
for three months now.

01:25:46.308 --> 01:25:47.765
I needed it to be believable.

01:25:47.893 --> 01:25:49.429
Well, it was that.

01:25:49.561 --> 01:25:51.223
I got to Donovan. You should be thanking me.

01:25:52.064 --> 01:25:55.228
Yeah, about that. Help me out here.

01:25:55.317 --> 01:25:57.183
How is it that
I still don't know what he's up to?

01:25:57.277 --> 01:25:58.563
He doesn't tell me anything.

01:25:58.654 --> 01:26:00.520
Oh, how convenient.

01:26:01.490 --> 01:26:04.153
You know, I don't why we ever thought
it would work with you.

01:26:04.242 --> 01:26:07.451
A hookerjoining the police. What a joke.

01:26:07.537 --> 01:26:10.405
Bastard. You good as made me do it.

01:26:10.540 --> 01:26:14.159
Just like Donovan's making you do...

01:26:14.294 --> 01:26:15.580
What?

01:26:21.176 --> 01:26:23.759
You know, I really think
you ought to have a little think

01:26:23.845 --> 01:26:26.428
about what he might do
if he finds out who you really are.

01:26:28.475 --> 01:26:32.219
Take it from me,
he doesn't treat informers very well.

01:26:32.312 --> 01:26:34.895
When this is done, I'm out, yeah?

01:26:34.981 --> 01:26:37.143
That's what you promised.

01:26:37.234 --> 01:26:40.443
Yourjob was to tell me about Donovan.

01:26:42.447 --> 01:26:44.063
He will kill you.

01:26:44.157 --> 01:26:46.740
- He'll kill you in a heartbeat.
- Fine.

01:26:46.827 --> 01:26:47.908
I've heard some things.

01:26:47.994 --> 01:26:49.826
I followed him and Fullerton
down to the coast.

01:26:49.913 --> 01:26:52.326
- You know, doing police work.
- Go on, tell me.

01:26:54.626 --> 01:26:56.162
And then I'm done?

01:26:56.253 --> 01:26:58.961
Or are you going to keep
popping up in my home?

01:26:59.047 --> 01:27:02.290
Yep, you're out of it all.
Now, just tell me what you know.

01:27:05.679 --> 01:27:07.090
What do you want?

01:27:07.222 --> 01:27:08.429
What do I want?

01:27:08.515 --> 01:27:12.134
Well, now, I want to be rich, happy,
and with someone who loves me.

01:27:12.227 --> 01:27:15.345
Children would be nice.
Pretty much what every man wants, right?

01:27:15.439 --> 01:27:18.648
I'm coming up short
on most of those things on that list.

01:27:19.109 --> 01:27:23.069
Listen, we should meet again.
Break some bread.

01:27:23.155 --> 01:27:24.362
<i>If I met up with you,</i>

01:27:25.073 --> 01:27:27.611
I wouldn't be thinking about breaking bread.

01:27:30.495 --> 01:27:33.329
Under all this pressure and you're still...
You're a funny guy.

01:27:33.415 --> 01:27:36.783
Listen, I'm going to send you a location.
I'll expect you there in one hour.

01:27:36.877 --> 01:27:38.038
Why should I?

01:27:38.795 --> 01:27:42.914
Well, I know for a fact
that you have your daughter safely with you.

01:27:44.050 --> 01:27:46.212
<i>But you're telling everyone who will listen</i>

01:27:46.344 --> 01:27:49.337
that you have no idea where she is.
That's curious.

01:27:50.515 --> 01:27:52.723
<i>I do hope they don't find out.</i>

01:28:03.236 --> 01:28:06.070
You're late. That's just rude.

01:28:11.411 --> 01:28:14.119
Actually, I was here half an hour before you.

01:28:15.081 --> 01:28:17.323
Just wanted to see you were alone.

01:28:17.709 --> 01:28:19.917
So you're hiding out
within half an hour of here.

01:28:20.253 --> 01:28:21.789
Perhaps.

01:28:22.923 --> 01:28:24.539
Or perhaps I was late.

01:28:33.475 --> 01:28:36.309
So... Tonight's the night.

01:28:39.773 --> 01:28:40.889
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:28:41.483 --> 01:28:44.317
The heroin from Afghanistan. Russians.

01:28:44.444 --> 01:28:46.401
South coast. Docks.

01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:51.483
- What are you talking about?
- I'm not wearing a wire, Donovan,

01:28:51.868 --> 01:28:53.734
if that's what concerns you.

01:28:53.829 --> 01:28:56.412
I spend my life being concerned.

01:28:57.249 --> 01:28:59.957
Fucking hell. Your life must be terrible.

01:29:00.877 --> 01:29:04.166
Always worried. Never knowing who to trust.

01:29:04.798 --> 01:29:08.667
Not even your... Your fucking wife.

01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:13.007
I gather you found her?

01:29:13.098 --> 01:29:14.384
The accountant

01:29:14.975 --> 01:29:16.011
disappeared.

01:29:17.519 --> 01:29:18.976
What are you after, Hathaway?

01:29:19.396 --> 01:29:22.855
I want your money, Donovan.

01:29:22.941 --> 01:29:25.149
I want all your money.

01:29:27.237 --> 01:29:29.069
Well, I don't have any.

01:29:29.573 --> 01:29:31.940
Oh, come. Nonsense.

01:29:32.033 --> 01:29:36.198
That's why I let the African know
where Vicky and her fuck buddy were hiding.

01:29:36.872 --> 01:29:40.240
Oh, I'm sorry. It... It's all right.
I... I do know what you're going through.

01:29:40.333 --> 01:29:43.451
My wife left me for someone else, too,
remember?

01:29:46.172 --> 01:29:47.504
So Stewart was one of your men, was he?

01:29:49.009 --> 01:29:51.717
Perhaps. Perhaps he wasn't.

01:29:51.845 --> 01:29:53.552
Well, cut to the chase, Hathaway, please.

01:29:54.848 --> 01:29:56.339
Of course.

01:29:56.433 --> 01:30:01.224
You, um... You have a boat to catch.

01:30:03.315 --> 01:30:06.683
Once that ship docks,
we'll have you for conspiracy.

01:30:06.818 --> 01:30:10.562
I can prove you put the deal together
whether you take delivery or not.

01:30:12.073 --> 01:30:13.689
You have nothing on me.

01:30:13.783 --> 01:30:17.026
- Well, I have people undercover.
- You're lying.

01:30:19.289 --> 01:30:23.533
And I don't know why
you keep talking about this ship.

01:30:23.668 --> 01:30:26.331
How do you think
I know about that ship, Donovan?

01:30:26.421 --> 01:30:28.583
The... The Russians? The... The heroin?

01:30:29.758 --> 01:30:35.345
I'd say Jordan got busted, and he
turned a story to try and save himself.

01:30:35.764 --> 01:30:38.006
Jordan?

01:30:38.099 --> 01:30:42.093
No. We're letting Jordan run around.
He's... He's vastly amusing.

01:30:46.066 --> 01:30:48.353
Can you risk that I'm bluffing, Donovan?

01:30:48.485 --> 01:30:50.477
I mean, even if we don't get you
for the ship tonight,

01:30:50.570 --> 01:30:51.731
what will your customers think?

01:30:52.530 --> 01:30:55.864
What will the network think
about being shafted for a second time

01:30:55.951 --> 01:30:57.362
by the great man himself?

01:30:57.702 --> 01:31:01.742
I really don't fancy your chances
in, or especially out, of jail.

01:31:03.208 --> 01:31:06.042
Okay, to amuse you,

01:31:06.127 --> 01:31:08.494
- how much?
- $20 million.

01:31:08.922 --> 01:31:13.713
Huh. I said to amuse you, not make me laugh.
You've got nothing.

01:31:14.844 --> 01:31:18.337
$20 million, I tell you the name of my man.

01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:20.881
I don't care.

01:31:21.351 --> 01:31:24.389
Oh, but you do. See, I know this personally.

01:31:24.479 --> 01:31:29.224
You care a great deal
about who you let into your world,

01:31:29.317 --> 01:31:32.151
your inner circle, your trust.

01:31:34.823 --> 01:31:37.406
I never knew how to get you.

01:31:37.492 --> 01:31:39.859
Couldn't get round your sixth sense.

01:31:39.953 --> 01:31:42.115
The suspense is killing me.

01:31:42.247 --> 01:31:43.658
Well, you joke, Donovan,

01:31:43.748 --> 01:31:46.991
but the thing is,
it is killing you, isn't it, hmm?

01:31:47.377 --> 01:31:49.289
You just have to know who it is.

01:32:08.732 --> 01:32:09.848
$20 million.

01:32:13.695 --> 01:32:14.856
There's my account.

01:32:22.746 --> 01:32:24.738
You know you've signed his death warrant.

01:32:24.831 --> 01:32:27.289
Well, his cover's blown now,
so he's not much use to me anymore, is he?

01:32:51.608 --> 01:32:53.895
Donovan's paid you everything
he owes you and more.

01:32:53.985 --> 01:32:56.728
So he obviously has gotten
his money back, right?

01:32:56.821 --> 01:32:58.062
What about the deal?

01:32:58.782 --> 01:33:01.399
- The one with the Russians?
- I... I don't know.

01:33:01.743 --> 01:33:04.235
'Course you do. 'Course you do.

01:33:05.163 --> 01:33:08.031
What I don't understand is why wouldn't
he give me the money personally?

01:33:08.166 --> 01:33:11.000
He's trying to find his daughter.
Nobody's seen her.

01:33:11.086 --> 01:33:14.705
And he just expects me to take off
just because he's paid me off?

01:33:15.173 --> 01:33:16.209
That's what he said.

01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:22.094
I mean, I think...
I think he's really pissed off at me.

01:33:22.180 --> 01:33:23.591
I mean, for taking his daughter.

01:33:23.681 --> 01:33:27.675
Actually, for losing his daughter. Huh?

01:33:28.770 --> 01:33:30.807
He might be planning
some sort of revenge, right?

01:33:30.897 --> 01:33:32.513
I mean,
why would he give you the money back

01:33:32.607 --> 01:33:33.643
if he was planning on revenge?

01:33:33.775 --> 01:33:35.937
You're right. You're right.

01:33:37.987 --> 01:33:40.445
Maybe he is a man of his word after all.

01:33:40.573 --> 01:33:43.236
What a fucking lunatic.

01:33:44.869 --> 01:33:46.235
Oh, well.

01:33:46.871 --> 01:33:48.453
I got a little something for you, my friend.

01:33:49.916 --> 01:33:51.123
For your troubles.

01:33:52.252 --> 01:33:53.242
Congratulations.

01:33:54.254 --> 01:33:58.373
You're the new owner of this charming place.

01:33:58.716 --> 01:34:01.800
Welcome to the drug and sex industry,
my friend.

01:34:02.428 --> 01:34:05.637
Oh, and, by the way, please tell Donovan
that I left for Colombia, will you?

01:34:06.975 --> 01:34:10.013
Because this place, London,

01:34:10.103 --> 01:34:13.187
it is way too fucking dangerous for me.

01:34:21.948 --> 01:34:23.405
Fullerton.

01:34:26.494 --> 01:34:27.610
I don't believe it.

01:34:27.745 --> 01:34:29.782
It was a great plan.

01:34:29.873 --> 01:34:32.536
You find potential recruits
with dodgy backgrounds

01:34:32.625 --> 01:34:34.332
before they join the force.

01:34:35.003 --> 01:34:38.917
Take advantage of their desire to do good
by throwing them into your world.

01:34:39.007 --> 01:34:42.171
No need for a cover story.
Nothing to slip them up.

01:34:42.302 --> 01:34:43.668
Perfect.

01:34:44.846 --> 01:34:47.759
You must have been very proud of yourself.

01:34:47.849 --> 01:34:50.592
And now you're throwing him
on the pile for money.

01:34:51.311 --> 01:34:54.770
Come on, Donovan.
I'm finally seeing things your way.

01:34:54.856 --> 01:34:56.848
All undercover are scum, right?

01:34:57.775 --> 01:35:00.108
Dispensable, right?

01:35:00.904 --> 01:35:03.612
Fullerton's actually been
particularly effective.

01:35:03.698 --> 01:35:05.610
He's given us some great
intel over the years.

01:35:05.992 --> 01:35:08.109
I mean, it is true, we had some luck.

01:35:08.203 --> 01:35:09.865
Your wife running off with all your money

01:35:09.954 --> 01:35:13.368
meant that you had to sell your paintings,
and that's how you two met.

01:35:13.499 --> 01:35:17.209
But, you know,
I always say these things are meant to be.

01:35:18.922 --> 01:35:20.504
Here's the thing.

01:35:20.965 --> 01:35:25.209
It wasn't Fullerton
who told us about this latest deal.

01:35:25.970 --> 01:35:27.131
The one tonight.

01:35:27.555 --> 01:35:30.639
Funny that.
Perhaps you have turned him properly?

01:35:32.435 --> 01:35:36.725
But for another $20 million,

01:35:40.235 --> 01:35:42.227
I can tell you how I do know.

01:35:46.115 --> 01:35:48.107
You're relentless, Hathaway.

01:35:48.993 --> 01:35:50.734
Who you working for now?

01:35:51.246 --> 01:35:53.954
Uh, myself, predominantly, and MI6.

01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:57.078
- Oh, the big league.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:35:58.586 --> 01:36:01.704
I imagine they won't take kindly to traitors.

01:36:01.798 --> 01:36:04.506
Oh, they won't find out about this.

01:36:04.592 --> 01:36:06.584
It's all offshore. It's secure.

01:36:06.678 --> 01:36:10.092
Besides, who's going to tell them?

01:36:10.181 --> 01:36:11.297
You?

01:36:15.645 --> 01:36:20.731
And if a ship were to arrive tonight,

01:36:22.610 --> 01:36:24.772
how many people would be waiting for it?

01:36:25.947 --> 01:36:29.065
Well, that's all part of the deal
for the $20 million.

01:36:30.785 --> 01:36:32.071
Yeah.

01:36:33.037 --> 01:36:34.494
Great.

01:36:36.374 --> 01:36:38.491
Can I trust you?

01:36:38.584 --> 01:36:41.918
I'll have $40 million, Donovan.

01:36:42.005 --> 01:36:44.873
It's a fair price to pay for my silence.

01:36:45.383 --> 01:36:47.420
And for what you did to me.

01:36:53.641 --> 01:36:54.757
Okay.

01:36:56.602 --> 01:36:57.592
Okay.

01:37:34.891 --> 01:37:37.634
Not going to open it, find out who it is?

01:37:57.163 --> 01:37:58.244
We've got Donovan.

01:37:59.540 --> 01:38:00.656
Are you sure?

01:38:00.792 --> 01:38:02.784
Southampton docks, midnight.

01:38:02.877 --> 01:38:05.335
Most of Afghanistan's
heroin export will be there.

01:38:05.421 --> 01:38:06.787
Quite the party.

01:38:06.923 --> 01:38:08.414
How secure is the intel?

01:38:08.508 --> 01:38:12.172
100%. Like the Rodriguez cocaine shipment.

01:38:13.805 --> 01:38:16.388
And all because my...

01:38:16.474 --> 01:38:19.683
Because our plan is about to deliver.

01:38:20.895 --> 01:38:22.352
Do you know what's in there?

01:38:23.231 --> 01:38:24.347
Do you?

01:38:25.024 --> 01:38:26.185
I can make a guess.

01:38:31.989 --> 01:38:34.447
What do you want me to say?

01:38:34.534 --> 01:38:35.820
The truth.

01:38:42.041 --> 01:38:44.283
My mission was to bring you down.

01:38:45.670 --> 01:38:47.081
But the lines became blurred.

01:38:49.507 --> 01:38:53.126
You were nothing like they told me.
I struggled to see the evil in you.

01:38:55.221 --> 01:38:57.508
It's all a matter of perspective.

01:38:57.598 --> 01:38:59.464
I could see you changing.

01:39:04.272 --> 01:39:06.264
And I could see myself

01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:08.732
liking you.

01:39:09.861 --> 01:39:11.773
Is that the truth?

01:39:13.239 --> 01:39:15.276
Hathaway said you'd kill me.

01:39:15.366 --> 01:39:18.575
He said he'd give me a way out
if I told him what I'd found out.

01:39:21.956 --> 01:39:23.868
Now I know he lied about everything.

01:39:25.626 --> 01:39:27.492
I'm sorry.

01:39:41.976 --> 01:39:43.433
What are you gonna do?

01:39:46.439 --> 01:39:47.896
What I always do.

01:40:20.973 --> 01:40:22.054
Evening, gentlemen.

01:40:22.475 --> 01:40:23.761
Nice to see you here for this one.

01:40:24.268 --> 01:40:25.679
Nice to be invited

01:40:26.312 --> 01:40:27.644
for this one.

01:40:28.397 --> 01:40:31.390
So, Mr Donovan, before your ship comes in,

01:40:31.484 --> 01:40:33.521
I'm curious as to how
we'll all be able to leave here

01:40:33.611 --> 01:40:35.443
without being stopped by security.

01:40:35.905 --> 01:40:38.318
- It's been taken care of.
- Humour me.

01:40:38.658 --> 01:40:39.648
Just relax, man.

01:40:39.784 --> 01:40:41.776
Man said it's taken care of, yeah?

01:40:41.869 --> 01:40:43.952
Anyways, we got these.

01:40:46.123 --> 01:40:49.332
Anyone try trip us up,
we'll play live-action <i>Call of</i> fucking <i>Duty.</i>

01:40:50.169 --> 01:40:52.035
That won't be needed.

01:40:52.129 --> 01:40:55.167
Security is part of the deal.

01:40:55.258 --> 01:40:58.046
I'm paying them off
as soon as the ship docks.

01:41:07.144 --> 01:41:09.010
<i>Target ship has arrived.</i>

01:41:09.605 --> 01:41:11.392
Can we confirm the shipment?

01:41:11.482 --> 01:41:14.566
<i>Negative. Overlook Hotel,
see if you can get on board.</i>

01:41:14.652 --> 01:41:15.608
Keep eyes on Donovan.

01:41:16.737 --> 01:41:18.694
Right. You can start unloading the gear.

01:41:21.075 --> 01:41:22.282
Where are you going?

01:41:22.994 --> 01:41:25.828
Pay off the security.
Weren't you listening to me?

01:41:38.759 --> 01:41:41.877
- Where's Donovan going?
<i>- Container 237.</i>

01:41:44.181 --> 01:41:45.422
Mr Donovan.

01:41:47.143 --> 01:41:50.386
Why didn't you pay off the security
before the ship docked?

01:41:51.397 --> 01:41:54.014
If the ship didn't arrive,

01:41:54.150 --> 01:41:55.482
why waste money?

01:41:55.568 --> 01:41:57.059
Can I come with you?

01:41:59.196 --> 01:42:00.562
Who are you?

01:42:01.365 --> 01:42:03.607
I'm the guy who's wondering
where you're going.

01:42:11.751 --> 01:42:13.492
Who the fuck's that?

01:42:14.170 --> 01:42:15.911
<i>Under fire! Under fire!</i>

01:42:18.257 --> 01:42:19.919
<i>Weapons free! Weapons free!</i>

01:42:28.726 --> 01:42:30.262
<i>Sierra 1, to your right.</i>

01:42:34.857 --> 01:42:36.268
<i>Man down! Man down!</i>

01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:40.356
<i>Target down!</i>

01:42:40.446 --> 01:42:41.812
<i>Eyes on PM. Take him out.</i>

01:42:41.947 --> 01:42:43.438
<i>Target neutralised.</i>

01:42:46.243 --> 01:42:48.906
<i>- We have control. Intel coming.</i>
- Where's Donovan?

01:42:48.996 --> 01:42:50.658
<i>No eyes. He's gone.</i>

01:42:50.748 --> 01:42:52.865
Fuck! Search the ship.

01:42:53.417 --> 01:42:56.285
<i>We're on the bridge. We're on the bridge.</i>

01:42:59.048 --> 01:43:00.880
No shooting! I have official papers.

01:43:03.094 --> 01:43:04.630
There was fuck-all on the ship.

01:43:05.304 --> 01:43:08.012
The Russians were picking up relief aid
for fucking Africa.

01:43:08.641 --> 01:43:10.303
<i>None of it had anything to do with Donovan.</i>

01:43:10.393 --> 01:43:13.010
What? Shit!

01:43:13.104 --> 01:43:15.346
<i>- Did you take him down?</i>
- He disa-fucking-ppeared.

01:43:15.481 --> 01:43:16.642
What a clusterfuck.

01:43:17.108 --> 01:43:18.599
You said the intel was...

01:43:18.734 --> 01:43:22.478
It was. It was rock solid.
Donovan must have...

01:43:22.571 --> 01:43:23.687
Fuck.

01:43:52.184 --> 01:43:53.925
You surprise me, Donovan.

01:44:05.865 --> 01:44:07.026
Is that you?

01:44:07.366 --> 01:44:09.528
I see you've found Louise.

01:44:09.618 --> 01:44:10.699
I thought you'd let her live.

01:44:10.786 --> 01:44:13.654
I thought maybe her charms
would have won your cock over.

01:44:13.748 --> 01:44:15.410
Really?

01:44:15.499 --> 01:44:18.037
Even though I despise anyone undercover?

01:44:19.211 --> 01:44:21.168
<i>Isn't that why you told me about her?</i>

01:44:21.255 --> 01:44:23.212
So what happened at the docks?

01:44:24.341 --> 01:44:27.129
You keep talking about docks and ships.

01:44:27.261 --> 01:44:28.752
<i>I'm at a loss.</i>

01:44:28.846 --> 01:44:31.213
Fuck you. You know exactly.

01:44:32.516 --> 01:44:35.805
Now, no more
of your misdirection and tricks, Donovan.

01:44:35.936 --> 01:44:39.270
I've only ever had one trick.

01:44:39.356 --> 01:44:42.849
That's to make the other guy
think he's the smartest player.

01:44:44.195 --> 01:44:46.312
I knew you had someone on the inside.

01:44:46.447 --> 01:44:50.191
Two people on the inside.
Now you've killed her and let Fullerton live.

01:44:50.785 --> 01:44:52.947
<i>I suppose he's worth something to you,</i>

01:44:53.037 --> 01:44:54.699
<i>now you've got all those drugs to move.</i>

01:44:54.789 --> 01:44:56.496
I'm no longer in the drugs business.

01:44:56.582 --> 01:44:58.494
Really? Wow. What a fucking saint.

01:44:58.584 --> 01:45:00.951
Enough of me.

01:45:01.045 --> 01:45:02.536
You've got my $40 million,

01:45:03.422 --> 01:45:04.708
<i>and I want it back.</i>

01:45:05.382 --> 01:45:06.463
Now why would I do that?

01:45:08.302 --> 01:45:12.797
I'm guessing your bosses
aren't fans of you murdering either.

01:45:16.644 --> 01:45:19.387
It doesn't matter
if you find the hidden camera.

01:45:19.522 --> 01:45:23.186
<i>I've still got footage of you
in a room with a dead girl.</i>

01:45:23.275 --> 01:45:25.232
<i>An undercover agent you put in danger.</i>

01:45:25.361 --> 01:45:28.320
- So what?
<i>- And I've got this.</i>

01:45:29.615 --> 01:45:31.277
Listen with Mother.

01:45:32.952 --> 01:45:35.035
<i>Oh, they won't find out about this.</i>

01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:37.112
<i>It's all offshore. It's secure.</i>

01:45:37.623 --> 01:45:40.741
Fuck you, Donovan. Fuck you!

01:45:58.352 --> 01:46:01.095
You never met Andrew Hathaway, did you?

01:46:01.188 --> 01:46:02.554
No. Who's he?

01:46:02.648 --> 01:46:07.063
He's the grand architect
of recruiting agents from people like you.

01:46:09.655 --> 01:46:10.691
Like me?

01:46:10.823 --> 01:46:13.566
Yeah. Like you, Warren.

01:46:13.659 --> 01:46:15.571
And Jamie Fullerton, Louise Leigh.

01:46:15.661 --> 01:46:16.651
The girl with Donovan?

01:46:16.787 --> 01:46:18.323
- They were like me?
- Yeah.

01:46:18.956 --> 01:46:21.198
"Were" being the operative word.

01:46:21.292 --> 01:46:22.999
Hathaway sold them out.

01:46:23.127 --> 01:46:24.743
Couldn't you have saved them? Step in?

01:46:24.879 --> 01:46:27.166
I never knew they were recruits.

01:46:27.256 --> 01:46:30.249
I was in at the start,

01:46:30.342 --> 01:46:32.379
but Hathaway kept it all clandestine.

01:46:32.803 --> 01:46:34.339
That's MI-fucking-6 for you.

01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:36.672
I always had a feeling about him.

01:46:36.765 --> 01:46:41.760
His grudge against Donovan
was always more vengeance than justice.

01:46:41.854 --> 01:46:45.848
- So I'm your big secret.
- Yes. Only I know that you're really one of us.

01:46:46.567 --> 01:46:49.230
So what would have happened
if he'd made me, like he made the others?

01:46:49.361 --> 01:46:52.069
Donovan only got to the others
because Hathaway exposed them.

01:46:53.032 --> 01:46:56.491
We didn't get Donovan this time,
but with what you now know...

01:46:56.577 --> 01:46:59.945
Hang on. At what point can I get off
this train and become a real copper?

01:47:00.039 --> 01:47:01.246
Ah.

01:47:01.832 --> 01:47:04.870
I'm afraid this particular train
is never stopping.

01:47:06.253 --> 01:47:09.041
If you want out, you're out.
But you'll be on your own.

01:47:09.173 --> 01:47:10.880
That's not what you sold me on.

01:47:11.550 --> 01:47:14.793
Things change. Sacrifices have to be made.

01:47:15.179 --> 01:47:17.011
Why didn't you warn me
you were watching at the docks?

01:47:17.139 --> 01:47:19.927
I could have been killed by one of those
trigger-happy task force fuckers!

01:47:20.059 --> 01:47:21.266
But you weren't, were you?

01:47:22.853 --> 01:47:25.345
You know, there's only one
big flaw in this whole thing.

01:47:25.439 --> 01:47:26.475
What's that, Warren?

01:47:26.899 --> 01:47:28.390
Everyone turned bad.

01:48:07.356 --> 01:48:09.348
- Hello, you.
- Hi.

01:48:29.461 --> 01:48:31.077
Misdirection.

01:48:32.131 --> 01:48:33.338
Huh.

01:48:34.967 --> 01:48:38.051
- How did he...
- Mr Donovan always knows.

01:48:38.137 --> 01:48:39.218
Yeah.

01:48:41.932 --> 01:48:42.968
What now?

01:48:43.976 --> 01:48:45.217
You have a choice.

01:48:46.979 --> 01:48:48.311
Can I offer you more money than...

01:48:48.397 --> 01:48:50.184
That is not one of your choices.

01:48:50.274 --> 01:48:51.810
Not one of my choices.

01:48:58.157 --> 01:48:59.318
Fuck.

01:49:02.703 --> 01:49:05.946
So what now? I jump or you push me?

01:49:06.040 --> 01:49:07.451
Suicide or murder.

01:49:07.583 --> 01:49:09.575
Oh, it will never look like murder.

01:49:17.634 --> 01:49:18.670
Where's Zoe?

01:49:18.802 --> 01:49:20.293
Cooking us supper.

01:49:20.387 --> 01:49:21.878
Oh, boy.

01:49:22.014 --> 01:49:23.596
And I thought nobody could kill me here.

01:49:30.397 --> 01:49:31.513
What is it?

01:49:33.609 --> 01:49:35.851
Just thought I saw someone I knew.

01:49:40.365 --> 01:49:42.652
It's idyllic.

01:49:42.743 --> 01:49:44.780
It's just sea and sky.

01:49:45.871 --> 01:49:47.533
It's beautiful.

01:49:49.625 --> 01:49:50.741
And it's home.
