00:00.154 --> 00:02.054
Harvey:
Previously on <i>Suits...</i>

00:02.055 --> 00:04.390
This is Harvey Specter.
He's our best closer.

00:04.457 --> 00:05.858
Recruiting, your interviews
are set up for tomorrow.

00:05.926 --> 00:07.326
I work better
alone anyway.

00:07.394 --> 00:08.661
We only hire
from Harvard,

00:08.728 --> 00:10.496
and you haven't even gone
to any law school.

00:10.563 --> 00:11.697
What if I told you
that I consume knowledge

00:11.765 --> 00:12.998
like no one you've ever met,

00:13.066 --> 00:14.199
and I've actually passed
the bar.

00:14.267 --> 00:16.468
Okay, hotshot,
fire up this laptop.

00:16.536 --> 00:17.836
Stock option backdating.

00:17.904 --> 00:20.172
Under IRC section 409a.

00:20.240 --> 00:21.507
You forgot
about Sarbanes-Oxley.

00:21.574 --> 00:23.008
Impressive, but you're sitting
at a computer.

00:23.076 --> 00:26.278
Playing Hearts.
If you want to beat me,

00:26.346 --> 00:27.513
you're going to have to do it
as something else.

00:27.580 --> 00:28.781
How can you know all that?

00:28.848 --> 00:30.316
Once I read something,
I understand it.

00:30.383 --> 00:32.718
And once I understand it,

00:32.786 --> 00:33.886
I never forget it.

00:33.954 --> 00:35.421
I'm inclined
to give you a shot.

00:35.488 --> 00:37.256
But if they find out I lied
about you going to Harvard,

00:37.324 --> 00:39.625
they'll take away my license.
You what?

00:39.693 --> 00:41.126
Not now, Donna.

00:41.194 --> 00:42.695
The Harvard law school
alumni database.

00:42.762 --> 00:44.863
I'm not saying
you won't get caught,

00:44.931 --> 00:45.831
but it won't be because
your story doesn't check.

00:45.899 --> 00:47.066
I'm Rachel Zane.

00:47.133 --> 00:48.801
I'll be giving you
your orientation.

00:48.868 --> 00:50.102
I love you.

00:50.170 --> 00:51.770
Harvey's
your commanding officer.

00:51.838 --> 00:53.706
However, Louis Litt,
he oversees all associates,

00:53.773 --> 00:54.840
so you'll also answer to him.

00:54.908 --> 00:56.475
Welcome to Pearson Hardman.

00:56.543 --> 00:57.843
How many more chances
are you going to give that kid?

00:57.911 --> 00:59.912
I didn't realize
we were keeping score.

00:59.980 --> 01:01.680
But if that's the case, I still
think he's coming out ahead.

01:01.748 --> 01:04.083
This habit of you empathizing
with every client--

01:04.150 --> 01:05.617
it's not getting
you anywhere.

01:05.685 --> 01:07.653
You need to deal in information
that can hold up.

01:07.721 --> 01:09.722
- That's what a real lawyer does.
- Why?

01:09.789 --> 01:11.190
- What?
- Fire me.

01:11.257 --> 01:12.291
Why would you do that to me?

01:12.359 --> 01:15.828
Life is this.
I like this.

01:15.895 --> 01:18.530
It's tough to have a
relationship with a first-year,

01:18.598 --> 01:20.199
or any year.

01:20.266 --> 01:23.035
You're playing with me,
and you know it.

01:23.103 --> 01:25.237
You kept flirting with me long
after you started dating her.

01:25.305 --> 01:27.106
How about you find yourself
some other paralegal?

01:27.173 --> 01:29.174
Because, as far
as I'm concerned, we're done.

01:29.242 --> 01:31.844
How did you two meet?
I dated his best friend.

01:31.911 --> 01:33.245
You always liked her.

01:33.313 --> 01:34.813
Nothing happened
until Trevor and I were done.

01:34.881 --> 01:37.182
- Never?
- Well, we did kiss once.

01:37.250 --> 01:38.817
- I can't.
- It's a real firm.

01:38.885 --> 01:40.686
But you can't tell
anyone ever.

01:40.754 --> 01:41.987
This guy is not your friend,

01:42.055 --> 01:43.155
he is an anchor
dragging you down.

01:43.223 --> 01:44.223
Get rid of him.

01:44.290 --> 01:46.091
He's my oldest friend.

01:46.159 --> 01:47.326
I know you're seeing Jenny,

01:47.394 --> 01:51.330
but I can't stop thinking
about the kiss.

01:51.398 --> 01:52.464
I'm Trevor Evans.

01:52.532 --> 01:53.832
I'm a friend of Mike Ross.
Yes.

01:53.900 --> 01:55.167
I wish I didn't have
to do this.

01:55.235 --> 01:56.668
There's something you need
to know about him,

01:56.736 --> 01:58.704
something Harvey Specter
hasn't told you.

02:00.000 --> 02:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:36.543 --> 02:37.709
Nervous?

02:37.777 --> 02:41.246
[Sighs]
I'd be lying if I said no.

02:41.314 --> 02:44.016
Well, I wouldn't
want you to lie.

02:44.084 --> 02:45.818
- She knows.
- She can't.

02:45.885 --> 02:47.086
She does.

02:47.153 --> 02:48.387
What's holding
on my Swinton merger?

02:48.455 --> 02:49.988
Are you kidding me?

02:50.056 --> 02:52.624
We've been over this, okay?
If she knew, you'd know.

02:52.692 --> 02:54.226
I do know.
The woman barely knows my name,

02:54.294 --> 02:55.461
and she just summoned me
for dinner.

02:55.528 --> 02:56.962
What is so funny?

02:57.030 --> 02:59.565
Watson, Klyman, Gallo,
Goldberg, and Specter.

02:59.632 --> 03:01.934
- Why are you naming--
- The last five senior partners?

03:02.001 --> 03:03.936
Every one of us was taken
to dinner by Jessica

03:04.003 --> 03:05.237
as a first-year.

03:05.305 --> 03:06.872
And now she's taking you,
which means--

03:06.940 --> 03:08.874
- This is a good thing.
- Exactly.

03:08.942 --> 03:10.209
Oh, God.

03:10.276 --> 03:11.310
- What now?
- What do I wear?

03:11.377 --> 03:13.312
Wh-what do I say?
What do I wear?

03:13.379 --> 03:15.681
We can discuss the prom
at recess.

03:15.748 --> 03:17.783
Tell me what the hell's
holding up my Swinton merger.

03:17.851 --> 03:19.318
Oh, it's just
a nuisance suit

03:19.385 --> 03:20.919
that needs to be cleaned up
before we can clear escrow.

03:20.987 --> 03:22.321
I'm all over it.

03:22.388 --> 03:23.822
Why wasn't that
the first thing you told me?

03:23.890 --> 03:25.190
Uh, I thought
I was getting exposed.

03:25.258 --> 03:26.825
This is
a little less important.

03:26.893 --> 03:29.161
My merger--
your panic attack.

03:29.229 --> 03:30.562
Your compassion.

03:30.630 --> 03:32.631
And I didn't have
a panic attack.

03:32.699 --> 03:34.166
I had a legitimate reason
for concern.

03:34.234 --> 03:36.768
Really? Why would she ask you
to dinner just to fire you?

03:36.836 --> 03:38.403
I don't know. A little
movie called <i>Goodfellas.</i>

03:38.471 --> 03:39.838
Did you see it?

03:39.906 --> 03:41.874
Joe Pesci thought he was
getting made--he got dead.

03:41.941 --> 03:43.509
That's your idea
of a legitimate reason?

03:43.576 --> 03:45.477
"Karen!
Where's the money, Karen?"

03:45.545 --> 03:48.113
- Go back to your cubicle.
- Hey, wait a minute. Do you--

03:48.181 --> 03:50.048
do you think that I might get
an office out of this dinner?

03:50.116 --> 03:51.750
A second ago, you thought
you were gonna get whacked.

03:51.818 --> 03:52.985
Now you want an office?
What?

03:53.052 --> 03:54.319
I'm adapting
to changing circumstances.

03:54.387 --> 03:56.688
Huh. Well, maybe you won't be
the worst lawyer

03:56.756 --> 03:58.090
in the history
of everything.

03:58.158 --> 04:00.759
"Put the gun down, Karen.

04:00.827 --> 04:02.361
Karen?"

04:02.428 --> 04:04.530
They never checked.

04:04.597 --> 04:05.731
What do you mean
"they never checked"?

04:05.798 --> 04:08.901
The Internet was not
what it is today.

04:08.968 --> 04:11.370
It was not so easy
to catch plagiarism.

04:11.437 --> 04:12.905
God,
that's awesome.

04:12.972 --> 04:14.606
- [Chuckles]
- Wait a minute.

04:14.674 --> 04:17.009
If you graduated college then,
then that--

04:17.076 --> 04:18.142
that would make you--

04:18.211 --> 04:19.644
Old enough
to run my own law firm.

04:19.712 --> 04:21.380
But you look so young.

04:21.447 --> 04:23.649
- Well, you know what they say.
- Mm-hmm.

04:23.716 --> 04:26.785
- True beauty is ageless.
- Black don't crack.

04:26.853 --> 04:29.354
[Coughs]
That's what I meant to say.

04:29.422 --> 04:32.024
[Clears throat]
Uhhuh.

04:32.091 --> 04:35.594
Well, enough about me.
I want to hear about you.

04:35.662 --> 04:39.831
What was Harvard like?

04:42.368 --> 04:43.702
I was three
when I realized

04:43.770 --> 04:46.438
that I wasn't like
the other kids.

04:46.506 --> 04:50.075
When school started,
it was like a joke.

04:50.143 --> 04:52.444
I didn't take notes.
I never studied.

04:52.512 --> 04:55.147
Every year
people would tell me,

04:55.215 --> 04:58.317
"Next year
you won't get away with it."

04:58.384 --> 05:01.253
Kept waiting for it
to get harder, but...

05:01.321 --> 05:03.355
it just never did.

05:03.423 --> 05:04.790
And Harvard?

05:04.857 --> 05:08.126
I knew it would end.
I mean, it had to.

05:08.194 --> 05:10.495
I thought, "Yeah,"
I'd finally found a place

05:10.563 --> 05:12.698
where I'd be, uh...

05:12.765 --> 05:14.433
exposed.

05:14.500 --> 05:17.736
But it turns out, even
at the mighty Harvard Law--

05:17.804 --> 05:19.938
You weren't the same
as the other kids.

05:20.006 --> 05:23.475
- I know it sounds cocky.
- Not to me.

05:23.543 --> 05:26.144
The fact is, you don't think
of yourself as smart.

05:26.212 --> 05:28.747
You've always had your mind,
it just is what it is.

05:28.815 --> 05:30.415
Yeah,
that's exactly what it is.

05:30.483 --> 05:32.351
I don't think of myself
as smart, you know.

05:32.418 --> 05:34.152
I just think
of everybody else as...

05:34.220 --> 05:37.689
- Idiots.
- Not smart.

05:37.757 --> 05:41.493
That's what
I meant to say.

05:41.561 --> 05:44.363
Why the law?

05:44.430 --> 05:46.231
It's kind of,
uh, personal.

05:46.299 --> 05:48.634
Isn't that why
we're here?

05:54.374 --> 05:55.540
When I was 11,

05:55.608 --> 05:58.343
my parents were
on their way home from dinner,

05:58.411 --> 06:02.247
and they were involved
in a really horrible accident.

06:02.315 --> 06:07.452
And, uh, they--

06:07.520 --> 06:11.156
my grandmother
took me in.

06:11.224 --> 06:15.294
And it wasn't until I was,
uh, much older

06:15.361 --> 06:18.497
that I realized
that we had a case.

06:18.564 --> 06:21.466
See, it turns out
this restaurant...

06:21.534 --> 06:24.503
they kept feeding
this Mr. Fenton drinks

06:24.570 --> 06:27.439
long after they knew--

06:30.276 --> 06:32.878
didn't matter.

06:32.945 --> 06:35.047
I just--

06:35.114 --> 06:39.918
I felt so helpless.

06:39.986 --> 06:42.387
And I didn't want
to feel that way...

06:42.455 --> 06:45.290
ever again.

06:48.227 --> 06:51.697
Harvey was right.

06:51.764 --> 06:53.565
About what?

06:53.633 --> 06:56.568
I hope you brought
your checkbook.

06:56.636 --> 07:00.739
Dinner's on you.

07:00.807 --> 07:05.043
Wait.
What was Harvey right about?

07:18.091 --> 07:19.658
[Door opens]

07:19.726 --> 07:22.294
- How was dinner?
- Free caviar.

07:22.362 --> 07:23.595
What's not to love?

07:23.663 --> 07:24.496
If you want to know
something about me,

07:24.564 --> 07:26.498
you should have just asked me.

07:26.566 --> 07:28.567
Why can't I just be getting
to know Mr. Ross

07:28.634 --> 07:30.268
the way I got to know you?

07:30.336 --> 07:31.670
Because if you're just trying
to get to know him,

07:31.738 --> 07:33.171
you would have told me
about the dinner.

07:33.239 --> 07:36.808
Something's going on,
and I want to know what it is.

07:36.876 --> 07:38.276
An allegation
was made

07:38.344 --> 07:40.011
that Mike Ross
never went to Harvard,

07:40.079 --> 07:42.948
or any other law school
for that matter.

07:43.015 --> 07:46.385
So I had him checked out.

07:46.452 --> 07:48.220
Squeaky clean.

07:48.287 --> 07:50.322
Graduated top
of his class.

07:50.390 --> 07:51.690
So I took him
to dinner.

07:51.758 --> 07:53.592
I wanted
to see what you saw in him

07:53.659 --> 07:54.826
that makes him
so special.

07:54.894 --> 07:57.262
And?

07:57.330 --> 07:59.064
I get it.

07:59.132 --> 08:00.265
He's a total package.

08:00.333 --> 08:03.902
Maybe even the best
of both of us.

08:03.970 --> 08:05.137
I hope this doesn't mean
you're gonna put me

08:05.204 --> 08:06.605
in charge of recruiting.

08:06.672 --> 08:11.276
Not to worry.
You are off the hook.

08:11.344 --> 08:16.515
Harvey,
one more thing.

08:16.582 --> 08:18.483
He might have
checked out clean,

08:18.551 --> 08:21.353
but I know
that kid's full of shit.

08:21.421 --> 08:22.921
Because there may be
a record

08:22.989 --> 08:24.556
of him graduating
from Harvard Law,

08:24.624 --> 08:26.024
but there's no record
of him graduating

08:26.092 --> 08:29.861
from any college anywhere
on the face of the earth.

08:29.929 --> 08:32.197
So I'm gonna give you
the benefit of the doubt

08:32.265 --> 08:34.099
that you didn't know.

08:34.167 --> 08:37.235
Because I don't want to do
what I would do if you did.

08:37.303 --> 08:40.472
And what you're going to do is
fire that goddamn kid.

Donna, do me a favor

09:23.109 --> 09:24.075
and get Mr. Sherman
on the phone, please.

09:24.143 --> 09:27.512
Thank you.

09:27.580 --> 09:30.482
- What was that?

18:22.348 --> 18:25.516
You know,
you didn't ask me how I knew.

18:25.584 --> 18:27.585
Trevor told me.

18:27.653 --> 18:29.587
- What?
- Two days ago. [Sniffles]

18:29.655 --> 18:31.089
Right before he told me

18:31.156 --> 18:32.390
that he was gonna tell
Jessica Pearson

18:32.458 --> 18:36.060
that you're a fraud.

18:36.128 --> 18:37.295
[Sniffles]

18:37.363 --> 18:39.297
[Car horn honks]

18:59.041 --> 19:04.513
[Indistinct whispering]

19:16.626 --> 19:19.461
[Toilet flushes]

19:27.170 --> 19:30.872
Well, if it isn't
the anointed one.

19:30.940 --> 19:32.474
Where the hell
you been?

19:32.542 --> 19:34.242
Well,
I'm not feeling very well.

19:34.310 --> 19:36.144
I don't really care.

19:36.212 --> 19:39.214
And I also don't care how
special Jessica thinks you are.

19:39.282 --> 19:42.651
<i>Because</i> you still
answer to me.

19:42.718 --> 19:44.386
And you're gonna do every piece
of work that I assign to you

19:44.453 --> 19:45.654
until you don't.

19:45.721 --> 19:47.956
Yeah, um,
I just have to see Harvey first.

19:48.024 --> 19:49.658
Oh, no, no, no.
Harvey can't help you.

19:49.725 --> 19:51.259
Now I want
the detailed listing

19:51.327 --> 19:53.361
of every redundant position
in the Swinton merger.

19:53.429 --> 19:55.897
And I want it yesterday,
<i>capisce?</i>

19:55.965 --> 20:00.468
And get a mint, because
your breath is disgusting.

20:00.536 --> 20:04.639
[Door opens]

20:04.707 --> 20:06.474
You drunk dialed him?

20:06.542 --> 20:08.977
I didn't drunk dial him.
I called him.

20:09.045 --> 20:10.512
Yeah, I left the room
for two minutes,

20:10.580 --> 20:12.013
and you called him
after a glass of whiskey.

20:12.081 --> 20:13.648
What would you call it?
Stupid.

20:13.716 --> 20:15.917
[Laughs] So what did you say
on the message?

20:15.985 --> 20:19.721
I said that I couldn't stop
thinking about our kiss.

20:21.958 --> 20:23.191
- You kissed him?
- Yes.

20:23.259 --> 20:25.827
- Where?
- On the mouth.

20:25.895 --> 20:28.964
- Where did it happen?
- In the library.

20:29.031 --> 20:31.766
- The Pearson Hardman library?
- No, the Library of Congress.

20:31.834 --> 20:33.335
- Was John Boehner there?
- Are you gonna help me?

20:33.402 --> 20:34.803
Or are you gonna
amuse yourself?

20:34.871 --> 20:37.072
- I can multitask.
- Oh.

20:37.139 --> 20:39.140
So what's the problem?

20:39.208 --> 20:41.076
The problem is
I left him that message

20:41.143 --> 20:44.746
three nights ago,
and he hasn't said anything.

20:44.814 --> 20:47.015
I don't know
what to do.

20:47.083 --> 20:49.184
Well, when a person
gets a message like that,

20:49.252 --> 20:51.319
and they act like they didn't,
it's one of two things.

20:51.387 --> 20:53.989
Either they got the message, and
they don't feel the same way,

20:54.056 --> 20:56.725
or they didn't get
the message.

20:56.792 --> 21:00.428
And who doesn't get
their messages?

21:00.496 --> 21:02.030
[Cell phone vibrates]
[Scoffs]

21:02.098 --> 21:03.465
He made his choice.

21:03.532 --> 21:06.001
- Whoa.
- What?

21:06.068 --> 21:07.802
I got to go.

21:07.870 --> 21:10.005
- [Sighs] Okay.
- Wait a second.

21:10.072 --> 21:11.072
How was it?

21:11.140 --> 21:13.708
The kiss?

21:13.776 --> 21:17.112
Good enough
to make me drunk dial him.

21:22.852 --> 21:24.653
Well,
what are we talking about?

21:24.720 --> 21:28.189
Jeremy Lin?
Yeah, I can make that happen.

21:31.127 --> 21:32.427
You knew.

21:32.495 --> 21:34.996
I got to go.

21:35.064 --> 21:38.066
- When?
- Last night.

21:38.134 --> 21:39.534
What are we gonna do?

21:39.602 --> 21:42.037
We've got no choice.

21:42.104 --> 21:45.874
We have to leave the country.
What?

21:45.942 --> 21:47.943
I can get us two tickets
to Buenos Aires

21:48.010 --> 21:50.245
and have the chopper
on the helipad in ten minutes.

21:50.313 --> 21:52.047
Wait. She knows?
And you know she knows?

21:52.114 --> 21:54.015
And you're joking about my life?
What the hell is wrong with you?

21:54.083 --> 21:56.251
- Are you mad at me?
- No, I want to kill you!

21:56.319 --> 21:58.353
Good, because if you're mad,
that means you're not panicking.

21:58.421 --> 22:01.089
Now calm the hell down.
[Sighs]

22:03.626 --> 22:05.527
[Sighs, clears throat]

22:05.594 --> 22:08.463
Okay, what did she say?

22:08.531 --> 22:11.433
- She told me to fire you.
- That's not calming me down.

22:11.500 --> 22:13.585
Haven't I taught you that
there's more than one response

22:13.586 --> 22:14.955
when someone has a gun
to your head?

22:14.980 --> 22:16.999
Right now there's
not even a gun in here.

22:17.306 --> 22:18.406
No, no.
It's not in here.

22:18.474 --> 22:19.774
It's out there roaming
the halls.

22:19.842 --> 22:21.409
And when it sees me,
it's gonna start shooting.

22:21.477 --> 22:22.978
Weren't you supposed
to give that plaintiff

22:23.045 --> 22:25.447
the Harvey Specter treatment?
Yes.

22:25.514 --> 22:27.549
- Did you wrap it up?
- I'm working on it.

22:27.616 --> 22:29.384
That means you didn't give her
the Harvey Specter treatment.

22:29.452 --> 22:32.020
So why don't you go do your job
and have some goddamn faith

22:32.088 --> 22:33.688
that I'll do mine?
Donna, not now.

22:33.756 --> 22:34.789
Oh, you're gonna want
to hear this.

22:34.857 --> 22:36.091
What?

22:36.158 --> 22:37.325
Alicia Hardman died
last night.

22:37.393 --> 22:39.527
Hard
as in Pearson Hardman?

22:39.595 --> 22:42.430
- Wife. Is it public yet?
- No.

22:42.498 --> 22:43.865
When were you going
to tell me she knew, Harvey?

22:43.933 --> 22:47.302
I wasn't.

22:48.738 --> 22:50.005
- Jessica.
- Louis.

22:50.072 --> 22:51.606
- How are you?
- Never better. You?

22:51.674 --> 22:54.409
Top of the world.

22:54.477 --> 22:56.845
- Did you need me?
- No.

22:56.912 --> 22:59.681
But I do have something that...
will make you happy.

22:59.749 --> 23:01.116
Oh. Fire away.

23:01.183 --> 23:02.784
Well, as you know,
I've been compiling a list

23:02.852 --> 23:04.419
of redundant departments
for the Swinton merger.

23:04.487 --> 23:05.920
You should also think
about compiling a list

23:05.988 --> 23:08.723
of redundant departments
for the Swinton merger.

23:08.791 --> 23:10.625
That is awesome.

23:10.693 --> 23:12.060
Anyway, I thought
you'd be happy to know

23:12.128 --> 23:15.230
that I, uh,
assigned it to Mike Ross.

23:15.297 --> 23:17.232
Excellent.
When?

23:17.299 --> 23:18.500
Just now.

23:18.567 --> 23:19.868
Harvey mentioned your dinner,
and I knew

23:19.935 --> 23:21.403
that was an indicator
of you being very fond--

23:21.470 --> 23:23.271
Louis, it's one
of the things I love about you.

23:23.339 --> 23:25.273
You get me.
I do.

23:25.341 --> 23:26.841
Yes.
[Elevator dings]

23:26.909 --> 23:29.978
Oh, I forgot something.
You go ahead, all right?

23:30.046 --> 23:32.614
And Louis, thank you.

23:32.681 --> 23:35.417
Sure.

23:44.827 --> 23:46.594
What the hell
is wrong with you?

23:46.662 --> 23:50.465
Not here.

23:52.134 --> 23:54.202
No.

23:54.270 --> 23:55.804
You think I don't know
what you're doing?

23:55.871 --> 23:57.472
I know you know what I did.

23:57.540 --> 23:59.340
You baited Louis
into working with Ross,

23:59.408 --> 24:00.608
so if he leaves abruptly,

24:00.676 --> 24:02.444
Louis will
start asking questions.

24:02.511 --> 24:04.746
I said I knew you knew.
Now you're just showing off.

24:04.814 --> 24:06.047
You think I'm gonna
let you get away with it?

24:06.115 --> 24:09.551
I think we've got bigger fish
to fry.

24:12.588 --> 24:14.355
Alicia Hardman's dead.

24:14.423 --> 24:17.192
Which means Daniel Hardman's
coming back.

24:17.259 --> 24:18.560
You don't know that.

24:18.627 --> 24:20.328
Yes, I do.
And so do you.

24:20.396 --> 24:22.330
No, you're just using
this situation

24:22.398 --> 24:24.232
to get Mike Ross out
of the crosshairs.

24:24.300 --> 24:27.435
Need I remind you that
the only reason we were able

24:27.503 --> 24:28.803
to get rid of the other half
of Pearson Hardman

24:28.871 --> 24:30.672
in the first place
was by threatening

24:30.739 --> 24:32.740
to tell her
about his affair?

24:32.808 --> 24:34.142
That was the means,
not the end.

24:34.210 --> 24:35.844
We had a good reason,
and you know that.

24:35.911 --> 24:37.112
That's not my point.

24:37.179 --> 24:40.115
Alicia's dead.
Our leverage is gone.

24:40.182 --> 24:42.183
That was five years ago.

24:42.251 --> 24:43.685
A lot can happen
in five years.

24:43.752 --> 24:45.053
And what Daniel Hardman's
been doing

24:45.121 --> 24:46.221
for the last five years

24:46.288 --> 24:48.590
is dreaming of the day
he comes back

24:48.657 --> 24:52.827
and screws us both
out of our jobs.

24:52.895 --> 24:53.728
There's an easy way
to find out.

24:53.796 --> 24:55.363
Then let's do it.

24:55.431 --> 24:58.233
'Cause I can tell you this,
that asshole's coming back.

24:58.300 --> 25:01.436
And he isn't coming because
he wants to be number two.

25:04.856 --> 25:07.191
[indistinct speech]

25:07.458 --> 25:09.359
I got to say,
he looks good.

25:09.427 --> 25:11.662
Being a prick
keeps you handsome.

25:11.729 --> 25:13.597
Are you saying
that I'm handsome?

25:13.665 --> 25:15.532
The fact that you think that
comment was directed at you

25:15.600 --> 25:18.268
makes you self-centered and vain
at the same time.

25:18.336 --> 25:20.037
Doesn't mean
it wasn't directed at me.

25:20.104 --> 25:21.705
It was.

25:21.773 --> 25:24.274
Which means
I'm also omniscient.

25:24.342 --> 25:25.409
And handsome.

25:25.476 --> 25:27.544
You left out arrogant.

25:27.612 --> 25:29.880
You know, you and Daniel
are cut from the same cloth.

25:29.948 --> 25:31.782
That's why
I don't like him.

25:31.849 --> 25:33.850
"There can be only one."

25:33.918 --> 25:36.353
We're at a funeral,
and you're quoting <i>Highlander?</i>

25:36.421 --> 25:37.454
Yeah,
a lot of people die in it.

25:37.522 --> 25:39.790
Seems appropriate.

25:39.857 --> 25:42.759
You know the one key difference
between the two of us?

25:42.827 --> 25:44.628
He's a lying snake
in the grass

25:44.696 --> 25:46.964
who'll say or do anything.

25:55.273 --> 25:57.474
Mr. Ross,

25:57.542 --> 25:58.842
the truth is
I don't remember

25:58.910 --> 26:00.444
where the James Jenkins pitch
came from.

26:00.511 --> 26:02.579
Then it could have come
from Myra.

26:02.647 --> 26:04.081
Well, it could have,
but it doesn't matter.

26:04.148 --> 26:06.750
Even if I had stolen it, she
signed the employee agreement.

26:06.818 --> 26:08.752
Which gives Drecker Publishing
the rights to her work product.

26:08.820 --> 26:10.053
Yes, I know.

26:10.121 --> 26:11.421
Well, then you also know
I'm not going

26:11.489 --> 26:13.523
to taint my company's reputation
by giving Myra credit.

26:13.591 --> 26:15.359
I'm not asking you
to give her credit.

26:15.426 --> 26:17.027
I'm asking you
to give her compensation

26:17.095 --> 26:18.862
in exchange for a confidential
settlement agreement,

26:18.930 --> 26:21.898
which protects
your reputation.

26:21.966 --> 26:24.267
That sounds
like blackmail.

26:24.335 --> 26:27.804
[Sighs]
Ms. Beckman.

26:27.872 --> 26:29.139
This lawsuit
is the only thing

26:29.207 --> 26:30.641
holding up
a billion-dollar merger.

26:30.708 --> 26:32.109
And every day
that it drags on,

26:32.176 --> 26:33.644
it's costing your company
more money.

26:33.711 --> 26:35.445
What I'm talking about

26:35.513 --> 26:38.181
is giving Myra Harrison
a crumb of a crumb.

26:38.249 --> 26:40.083
So stop worrying
about what it sounds like,

26:40.151 --> 26:43.153
and start writing a check.

26:43.221 --> 26:46.056
How much
is it gonna cost?

26:46.124 --> 26:48.592
That's what
I want to hear.

26:48.660 --> 26:50.560
Just look at 'em.

26:50.628 --> 26:53.096
Sycophants.
It makes me sick.

26:53.164 --> 26:54.731
I'm not gonna stand in line
for the privilege

26:54.799 --> 26:56.833
of kissing Daniel Hardman's ass,
and neither are you.

26:56.901 --> 26:59.136
- It's a funeral.
- The man was a slave driver.

26:59.203 --> 27:00.971
All he ever did was shit on me

27:01.039 --> 27:02.539
and make me work long hours
for him.

27:02.607 --> 27:04.207
I mean,
where was the kind word?

27:04.275 --> 27:06.376
You know, the tiny gesture?
Yeah, I don't think so.

27:06.444 --> 27:08.412
- To be fair, it's not--
- Zip it, I'm talking.

27:08.479 --> 27:10.747
And then he just ups and leaves,
you know?

27:10.815 --> 27:13.283
To take care
of his dying wife.

27:13.351 --> 27:16.420
So?
I'm not waiting in line, okay?

27:16.487 --> 27:18.088
I'm not gonna give the guy
the satisfaction.

27:18.156 --> 27:20.157
What I meant was
now that she's dead,

27:20.224 --> 27:24.461
does that mean
that he's coming back?

27:24.529 --> 27:26.530
Actually, this line looks
like it's flowing.

27:26.597 --> 27:29.066
And you're not com--no.
What is that?

27:29.133 --> 27:32.002
- That's my, uh, cancer ribbon.
- No, I know what it is.

27:32.070 --> 27:33.704
Why are you wearing it?

27:33.771 --> 27:35.906
Well, I wanted to show
my support for Mrs. Hardman.

27:35.973 --> 27:38.241
It's what she died of,
and I-I also had this aunt

27:38.309 --> 27:39.743
that, um, she--

27:46.918 --> 27:48.685
- $30,000.

27:48.753 --> 27:51.021
That is a lot of money.
Yeah, it is.

27:51.089 --> 27:53.957
It's as much as they've ever
paid for a freelance pitch.

27:54.025 --> 27:55.525
But those people
also got credit,

27:55.593 --> 27:58.462
which helped them sell
their next idea for more.

27:58.529 --> 27:59.763
I thought you said
you were worried

27:59.831 --> 28:02.265
you'd never have
another good idea.

28:02.333 --> 28:03.967
Myra, this is-

28:04.035 --> 28:05.669
this is the best deal
you're going to get.

28:05.737 --> 28:07.738
I'm not exactly sure
that's true.

28:07.805 --> 28:11.775
No, trust me,
it is.

28:11.843 --> 28:13.610
You said you're
in the middle of a merger

28:13.678 --> 28:15.278
and that
I'm an inconvenience.

28:15.346 --> 28:18.014
I did my research.
It's a huge merger.

28:18.082 --> 28:20.917
- I told you that to help you.
- You told me that to bully me.

28:20.985 --> 28:23.420
- You only tried to help later.
- And I succeeded.

28:23.488 --> 28:26.990
Which is why you have a check
for $30,000 in your hands.

28:27.058 --> 28:29.259
Do you believe
that was my idea?

28:29.327 --> 28:31.561
I know you do.
That's why you agreed to help.

28:31.629 --> 28:34.164
- What's your point?
- My point is...

28:34.232 --> 28:37.434
Lesley was my boss,
but I thought we were friends.

28:37.502 --> 28:41.071
So when she asked me
to trust her, I did.

28:41.139 --> 28:42.572
And she betrayed me.

28:42.640 --> 28:46.877
Can you imagine
what that would be like?

28:57.388 --> 28:59.790
Got to say,
up close, I feel bad for him.

28:59.857 --> 29:03.827
Just don't forget
why we're here.

29:03.895 --> 29:05.228
Daniel.

29:05.296 --> 29:07.430
I'm sorry for your loss.

29:07.498 --> 29:08.832
Thank you.

29:08.900 --> 29:10.267
Harvey.

29:10.334 --> 29:12.469
My condolences.

29:12.537 --> 29:14.437
Doesn't sound the same,
coming from you.

29:14.505 --> 29:16.273
You have my sympathy
for your wife,

29:16.340 --> 29:18.775
but I don't pretend
this is page one of the story.

29:18.843 --> 29:20.577
You must think
I hate you both.

29:20.645 --> 29:22.612
Well, that might have
something to do with the fact

29:22.680 --> 29:25.115
that I was listening
the last time you spoke to me.

29:25.183 --> 29:27.584
I was pissed,
wasn't I?

29:27.652 --> 29:28.919
You threw your phone
at my head.

29:28.986 --> 29:30.520
I did miss though.

29:30.588 --> 29:31.988
That's because
you throw like a girl.

29:32.056 --> 29:34.558
You're still angry, Harvey,
and I don't blame you.

29:34.625 --> 29:36.793
But what you don't understand

29:36.861 --> 29:40.230
is the last five years
have changed everything for me.

29:40.298 --> 29:43.200
How so?

29:43.267 --> 29:45.068
I reconnected
with Alicia.

29:45.136 --> 29:47.304
I cared for her.

29:47.371 --> 29:51.942
I know you can't get back
lost time with your family,

29:52.009 --> 29:55.779
but you can make up
for it.

29:55.847 --> 29:57.647
Look at Sarah.

29:57.715 --> 30:00.917
I never really knew her,
and now I do.

30:00.985 --> 30:03.486
Last time I saw her,
she was a little girl.

30:03.554 --> 30:05.422
She just graduated
high school.

30:05.489 --> 30:08.558
Going to Harvard,
this fall.

30:08.626 --> 30:10.527
The truth is...

30:10.595 --> 30:11.862
what you did <i>to</i> me

30:11.929 --> 30:14.731
was the best thing
anyone could have done for me.

30:14.799 --> 30:17.868
That mean
you're coming back?

30:17.935 --> 30:21.238
It's my wife's funeral,
Harvey.

30:21.305 --> 30:23.940
I haven't given it
any real thought yet.

30:27.812 --> 30:28.979
I am a changed man,
Jessica.

30:29.046 --> 30:31.815
And I have you
to thank for it.

30:34.919 --> 30:36.786
You actually buying
that pious bullshit?

30:36.854 --> 30:38.188
Not for a second.

30:38.256 --> 30:39.723
He's coming for us.

30:39.790 --> 30:42.325
I can stop him before
he even gets through the door.

30:42.393 --> 30:44.227
I don't see how you're gonna
be able to do that.

30:44.295 --> 30:47.264
I'll have
extra motivation.

30:47.331 --> 30:49.799
- You want the kid to stay.
- Yes.

30:49.867 --> 30:52.469
Like I said,
cut from the same cloth.

30:52.536 --> 30:54.838
Make it happen.

30:54.906 --> 30:57.674
You've got yourself
a deal.

31:07.033 --> 31:09.201
Why haven't I been notified
that my merger's closing?

31:09.269 --> 31:11.837
Uh, the plaintiff's refusing
to settle without credit.

31:11.905 --> 31:13.205
What happened
to steamrolling her?

31:13.273 --> 31:15.174
She realized that she's
in a unique position

31:15.241 --> 31:16.508
to hold up the merger.

31:16.576 --> 31:18.410
How the hell
did she realize that?

31:18.478 --> 31:20.412
Oh, no, wait.
Don't tell me.

31:20.480 --> 31:22.581
You fell in love with her,
and then you told her.

31:22.649 --> 31:24.316
No, I did not fall
in love with her,

31:24.384 --> 31:27.052
but... yeah,
I believe her.

31:27.120 --> 31:29.588
- You're kidding me.
- What?

31:29.656 --> 31:30.956
I'm fighting
for your job,

31:31.024 --> 31:32.424
and you're gonna screw up
this merger?

31:32.492 --> 31:35.093
- Are you?
- Am I what?

31:35.161 --> 31:37.462
Fighting for my job.

31:37.530 --> 31:39.631
Because if you're not,
this is gonna be my last case,

31:39.699 --> 31:40.732
and I'm not sure
I want to go down

31:40.800 --> 31:42.201
fighting for the wrong side.

31:42.268 --> 31:43.702
What makes you think
I'm not fighting for you?

31:43.770 --> 31:46.538
Mm, I don't know.
Your career--my anything.

31:46.606 --> 31:48.207
Oh, you got a lot of nerve.

31:48.274 --> 31:50.576
You have no idea
what I've been doing for you.

31:50.643 --> 31:51.877
Maybe.
But you and I both know

31:51.945 --> 31:55.080
you were gonna fire me
the other day, don't we?

31:55.148 --> 31:57.416
Don't answer that.
I can see the look on your face.

31:57.483 --> 31:59.151
It's the same look
I can see in here,

31:59.219 --> 32:01.620
from that morning,
clear as a bell.

32:01.688 --> 32:03.121
What I was going to do
and what I did

32:03.189 --> 32:04.790
aren't the same thing.

32:04.857 --> 32:06.525
Like the first day
I met you,

32:06.593 --> 32:08.594
when you were gonna deal drugs
and you didn't.

32:08.661 --> 32:10.062
Look, I can't tell you

32:10.129 --> 32:12.030
everything that's going on here,
all right?

32:12.098 --> 32:14.132
But you have
to trust me.

32:14.200 --> 32:17.569
You are not getting fired
on my watch.

32:21.507 --> 32:23.108
I trust you.

32:23.176 --> 32:25.410
Then stop worrying
about what side you're on,

32:25.478 --> 32:28.714
and take care
of that lawsuit.

32:31.451 --> 32:32.784
Hey, Rachel,
do you have a minute?

32:32.852 --> 32:34.086
- I need to--
- No, I don't.

32:34.153 --> 32:35.454
Got your message
loud and clear.

32:35.521 --> 32:37.889
- Wait. What?
- Look, I'm not mad.

32:37.957 --> 32:39.424
I'm just in the middle
of a lot of work right now.

32:39.492 --> 32:41.793
So if you're looking
for a friend, I--

32:41.861 --> 32:46.465
I just really don't have
the time. Sorry.

32:46.532 --> 32:49.401
What message?

32:56.075 --> 32:58.143
You must really be
needing some love.

32:58.211 --> 32:59.778
Why do you say that?

32:59.846 --> 33:05.083
Those cookies are from
the Eisenhower administration.

33:05.151 --> 33:07.786
You know...

33:07.854 --> 33:10.122
sometimes--

33:10.189 --> 33:12.057
sometimes I wish
I could go back.

33:12.125 --> 33:13.659
To when?

33:13.726 --> 33:17.629
Before... it.

33:20.500 --> 33:22.267
When I was little,

33:22.335 --> 33:23.669
I used to sit
with my grandmother

33:23.736 --> 33:25.704
whenever I was upset.

33:25.772 --> 33:28.273
A mother loves you,
but a grandmother--

33:28.341 --> 33:30.075
Always on your side.

33:30.143 --> 33:32.210
Do you remember
that time that I...

33:32.278 --> 33:34.613
Ran away to your place?

33:34.681 --> 33:37.049
You were so mad
they wouldn't let you stay up

33:37.116 --> 33:38.850
to watch <i>The Cosby Show.</i>

33:38.918 --> 33:41.153
I know.
It's so unreasonable, right?

33:41.220 --> 33:42.821
But you were six.

33:42.889 --> 33:45.090
You took me in,
told me that story--

33:45.158 --> 33:46.792
the time you ran away
from your parents.

33:46.859 --> 33:50.829
Yeah, I ended up getting found
by some dock workers

33:50.897 --> 33:52.064
3 miles
from the house.

33:52.131 --> 33:55.133
Yeah, that's the one.

33:55.201 --> 33:58.537
- Never happened.
- What?

33:58.604 --> 34:01.640
I just wanted to make you
miss your mom and dad.

34:01.708 --> 34:04.643
I basically told you
<i>Hansel and Gretel.</i>

34:04.711 --> 34:07.079
What? No.
It ends so differently.

34:07.146 --> 34:08.847
I added
some touches.

34:08.915 --> 34:10.482
You wouldn't have bought

34:10.550 --> 34:13.585
me getting eaten
by the dock workers.

34:13.652 --> 34:15.487
You were six,
you weren't an imbecile.

34:15.554 --> 34:18.489
There is nothing new un--

34:18.558 --> 34:20.826
under the sun.

34:20.893 --> 34:22.860
What?

34:22.929 --> 34:25.697
I suddenly feel
so much better.

34:25.764 --> 34:29.167
Thank you.
Mwah!

34:29.235 --> 34:31.570
Oh, and is there anything else
you haven't been telling me?

34:31.637 --> 34:33.038
Like, am I from Krypton?

34:33.106 --> 34:35.373
Possible.

34:48.087 --> 34:51.889
[Distant chatter]

34:51.958 --> 34:54.059
Hi.
Harvey Specter.

34:54.127 --> 34:55.860
I'm Sarah.

34:55.928 --> 34:58.830
Um, I saw you talking
to my father at the service.

34:58.898 --> 35:00.031
We used to work together.

35:00.099 --> 35:02.000
Did you know my mom?

35:02.068 --> 35:04.770
Not as well
as I would have liked.

35:04.837 --> 35:07.406
Um, I was
just going out.

35:07.473 --> 35:09.541
I need a walk.

35:09.609 --> 35:11.076
Dad's just over there.

35:11.144 --> 35:13.578
I'm sure he'll be happy
to see you.

35:13.646 --> 35:16.081
I'm sorry
for your loss.

35:16.149 --> 35:19.985
Thank you.

35:25.825 --> 35:27.859
Will you excuse me
for one second?

35:27.927 --> 35:29.661
- Mm-hmm.
- Thanks.

35:33.065 --> 35:34.599
Harvey?

35:34.667 --> 35:36.034
You brought food.

35:36.102 --> 35:38.036
New York's finest.

35:38.104 --> 35:39.471
You didn't want
to come empty-handed.

35:39.539 --> 35:40.972
I didn't want to come here
at all.

35:41.040 --> 35:43.809
But you want to make sure
I don't come back.

35:43.876 --> 35:46.178
When we found out
about your little scam,

35:46.245 --> 35:48.613
I wanted to go public.
Jessica said no.

35:48.681 --> 35:50.749
Didn't want
to damage the firm's reputation.

35:50.817 --> 35:52.451
She always was
a strategic thinker.

35:52.518 --> 35:54.719
But you've been gone
a long time.

35:54.787 --> 35:57.055
Now when we tell everyone
what you were up to,

35:57.123 --> 35:59.391
our reputation will be fine,
yours won't.

35:59.459 --> 36:00.826
As I said before,

36:00.893 --> 36:04.529
I haven't decided
what the future holds for me.

36:04.597 --> 36:07.365
And all your little threat
is doing is...

36:07.433 --> 36:10.035
making me want
to come back.

36:10.102 --> 36:13.505
When I was growing up,
I had a friend who found out

36:13.573 --> 36:15.874
that his mother never loved
his father.

36:15.942 --> 36:18.577
She cheated on him their
whole marriage, then left him.

36:18.644 --> 36:20.612
He never forgave her.

36:20.680 --> 36:22.914
If you come back,
here's what's gonna happen.

36:22.982 --> 36:26.585
Your daughter's gonna find out
what kind man her father is.

36:26.652 --> 36:27.786
Everything.

36:27.854 --> 36:29.754
You think I won't do that?

36:29.822 --> 36:33.492
I will.

36:33.559 --> 36:35.260
Why are you doing this?

36:35.328 --> 36:39.431
To protect my own.

36:39.499 --> 36:43.335
Do us all a favor
and set up shop somewhere else.

36:49.408 --> 36:53.111
[Cell phone rings]

36:53.179 --> 36:54.279

36:54.347 --> 36:56.348
He won't be coming back.

36:56.415 --> 36:58.750
Think I figured out a way
to get everybody what they want.

36:58.818 --> 37:01.987
Well, that's good.

37:02.054 --> 37:03.288
What's she doing here?

37:03.356 --> 37:05.423
Well, she's here
to get what she wants.

37:05.491 --> 37:07.225
Which is what,
exactly?

37:07.293 --> 37:09.594
- Credit.
- That's all Myra's looking for.

37:09.662 --> 37:11.763
So just admit that
you remember the pitch

37:11.831 --> 37:13.431
and that you know
what you did.

37:13.499 --> 37:15.867
I have no intention of doing
that because it's not true.

37:15.935 --> 37:17.836
So you'd be willing
to take a lie-detector test

37:17.904 --> 37:19.104
to that effect, then?

37:19.171 --> 37:21.973
I most certainly
will not.

37:22.041 --> 37:24.242
And I don't appreciate
being spoken to like this

37:24.310 --> 37:25.844
by my own counsel.

37:25.912 --> 37:27.846
Well, the thing is, Lesley,
that Myra's not the only one

37:27.914 --> 37:30.015
who signed an agreement
with Drecker Publishing.

37:30.082 --> 37:31.316
So did you.

37:31.384 --> 37:32.784
And that agreement
gives them the right

37:32.852 --> 37:35.020
to terminate you if you refuse
to submit to a polygraph.

37:35.087 --> 37:37.889
And I happen to represent them,
not you.

37:41.394 --> 37:42.427
I took it.

37:42.495 --> 37:44.563
- Hmm.
- I was under the gun.

37:44.630 --> 37:45.864
I was entitled to it,
so I took it.

37:45.932 --> 37:48.433
You offered me advice,

you got the credit you wanted...

37:55.942 --> 37:58.843
so sign the deal.

37:58.911 --> 38:01.646
No, I want public credit.
Not credit in here.

Lester Collins.

38:20.266 --> 38:21.566
Any one of them
could have been written

38:21.634 --> 38:23.234
on the basis of your pitch.

38:23.302 --> 38:26.671
But they weren't because they
were written years before it.

38:26.739 --> 38:28.406
Are you saying
I plagiarized them?

38:28.474 --> 38:32.410
I'm--I'm saying there's
nothing new under the sun.

38:32.478 --> 38:34.879
Now I suggest you sign that deal
and go home.

38:34.947 --> 38:36.348
Otherwise
we're gonna countersue

38:36.415 --> 38:38.917
for plagiarizing your pitch
from our previous works.

38:38.985 --> 38:40.218
But it's not true.

38:40.286 --> 38:42.153
It's no less legitimate
than claiming

38:42.221 --> 38:43.755
we stole something
you gave us the rights to.

38:43.823 --> 38:46.257
And, more importantly,
it puts you over a barrel,

38:46.325 --> 38:48.860
which is where you think
you have us.

38:56.602 --> 39:01.406
[Scribbling]

39:01.474 --> 39:02.641
Myra.

39:02.708 --> 39:04.309
You want to be writer?

39:04.377 --> 39:06.244
Then write.

39:06.312 --> 39:10.015
But don't ever threaten me
or my firm again.

39:16.541 --> 39:18.442
- You look happy.
- I am happy.

39:18.509 --> 39:21.378
- Anything I should know?
- Welcome to Pearson Hardman.

39:21.446 --> 39:24.514
Anything I should know?

39:24.582 --> 39:25.616
Settled the case.

39:25.683 --> 39:27.084
Merger paperwork's on the way.

39:27.151 --> 39:28.585
You slammed the plaintiff?

39:28.653 --> 39:30.087
- Oh, I slammed everybody.
- That's I like to hear.

39:30.154 --> 39:33.490
["Hear" echoes]

39:33.558 --> 39:36.159
When I ran Pearson Hardman...

39:36.227 --> 39:41.131
I was charming, witty
and adorable.

39:41.199 --> 39:43.066
[Chuckling]

39:43.134 --> 39:46.003
I was also unscrupulous...

39:46.070 --> 39:48.105
power-hungry and greedy.

39:48.172 --> 39:50.340
I thought I could get away
with anything.

39:50.408 --> 39:51.541
And that's exactly
what I tried to do.

39:51.609 --> 39:53.176
I risked the firm's reputation

39:53.244 --> 39:56.947
and the careers
of everyone in it.

39:57.015 --> 40:01.018
These last few years
have humbled me.

40:01.085 --> 40:02.719
And I've decided to come back

40:02.787 --> 40:04.454
and show that we can be
a successful law firm

40:04.522 --> 40:07.357
without breaking the rules.

40:07.425 --> 40:09.526
Unfortunately,
the only way that I can do that

40:09.594 --> 40:12.629
is by coming clean
about my past.

40:12.697 --> 40:16.867
Because if we are busy hiding
what we have done...

40:16.935 --> 40:18.669
it leaves us vulnerable

40:18.736 --> 40:21.004
to anyone
who discovers our secrets.

40:21.072 --> 40:25.776
And we become so consumed
with keeping them,

40:25.843 --> 40:29.479
that it is a slippery slope
to doing even worse things.

40:29.547 --> 40:32.115
While I was head of this firm,

40:32.183 --> 40:37.254
I borrowed funds
from various escrow accounts.

40:37.322 --> 40:38.922
The clients never found out
about it.

40:38.990 --> 40:40.123
I paid back every cent.

40:40.191 --> 40:41.558
But make no mistake,

40:41.626 --> 40:43.393
I could have been convicted
of theft,

40:43.461 --> 40:44.995
plain and simple.

40:45.063 --> 40:50.033
I want everyone here
to know the kind of man I was.

40:50.101 --> 40:53.603
And the kind of man I am.

40:53.671 --> 40:56.373
Thank you.

41:00.678 --> 41:01.912
Go home now.

41:01.980 --> 41:04.815
Don't come back.

41:08.586 --> 41:12.522
You and I
are gonna have a talk.

41:12.590 --> 41:16.059
I understand why
you had Harvey do what he did.

41:16.127 --> 41:18.528
But I'm not the same person.

41:18.596 --> 41:20.864
And the only way
that I could think to prove it

41:20.932 --> 41:24.134
was by doing
what I just did.

41:24.202 --> 41:27.004
I told my daughter everything.

41:27.071 --> 41:30.707
I hope we can figure out a way
to work together.

41:38.449 --> 41:41.018
Didn't think you'd have
the guts to show up.

41:41.085 --> 41:42.519
- What do you want?
- What do I want?

41:42.587 --> 41:44.454
I want to know how my best
friend could do this to me.

41:44.522 --> 41:46.690
Do what to you? Huh?

41:46.758 --> 41:48.425
Betray you?
Go behind your back?

41:48.493 --> 41:51.762
I stood there joking with you--
my friend, my buddy.

41:51.829 --> 41:56.033
And my girlfriend was
in your shower, three feet away.

41:56.100 --> 41:57.968
Hope you two
had a good laugh about that.

41:58.036 --> 41:59.436
I was gonna
tell you, Trevor.

41:59.504 --> 42:01.838
But you didn't.

42:01.906 --> 42:03.874
And I wasn't gonna tell Jenny
about Rachel,

42:03.941 --> 42:05.409
but I did.

42:05.476 --> 42:06.943
How'd you even know
about me and Rachel?

42:07.011 --> 42:08.111
You know what?

42:08.179 --> 42:09.479
You're so smart,
you figure it out.

42:09.547 --> 42:11.815
Okay, yeah, you got me.
Jenny broke up with me.

42:11.883 --> 42:16.319
But you went to my boss.
You tried to ruin my life.

42:16.387 --> 42:18.622
We're even.

42:18.689 --> 42:23.860
990-36-7249.

42:23.928 --> 42:26.396
It's your
social security number, right?

42:26.464 --> 42:29.032
I saw it on your dad's desk
when we were in the sixth grade.

42:29.100 --> 42:32.469
See, you think
that you can mess with my life,

42:32.537 --> 42:35.105
and I can't mess with yours,
but I can.

42:35.173 --> 42:36.907
The only thing
that's stopped me until now

42:36.974 --> 42:38.608
is the fact
that I actually cared about you.

42:38.676 --> 42:40.010
But now, after this,

42:40.078 --> 42:43.980
I really don't give a shit
about you anymore.

42:44.048 --> 42:48.051
You might not have my memory,
but you better remember that.

42:55.526 --> 42:57.094
What the hell did you say
to Daniel?

42:57.161 --> 42:58.628
Does it matter?

42:58.696 --> 42:59.863
What matters
is I don't ever want

42:59.931 --> 43:01.398
to see Mike Ross
in this office again.

43:01.466 --> 43:04.835
- Well, that's not gonna happen.
- Excuse me?

43:04.902 --> 43:06.770
I'm not firing him.

43:06.838 --> 43:09.072
Then I'll fire him.

43:09.140 --> 43:10.407
No, you won't.

43:10.475 --> 43:12.476
You said you gave me
the benefit of the doubt

43:12.543 --> 43:15.145
that I didn't know about Mike,
otherwise you'd fire me too.

43:19.250 --> 43:21.017
Well, I knew.

43:21.085 --> 43:23.620
You trying
to force my hand?

43:23.688 --> 43:24.654
I'm trying
to stay your hand.

43:24.722 --> 43:27.791
He goes, I go.

43:27.859 --> 43:31.061
Pack up your things.
You're done.

43:31.129 --> 43:33.063
There's only one problem
with that.

43:33.131 --> 43:34.965
Daniel's coming for your job.

43:35.032 --> 43:36.766
If I leave now,

43:36.834 --> 43:38.802
he'll smell something's wrong,
he'll figure out what it is.

43:38.870 --> 43:40.137
You'll look reckless

43:40.204 --> 43:42.172
for letting me hire a kid
without a degree,

43:42.240 --> 43:44.341
or foolish
for not knowing I did it.

43:44.408 --> 43:46.343
Neither quality being an asset
in a managing partner.

43:46.410 --> 43:47.511
Which makes you vulnerable.

43:47.578 --> 43:49.045
All because you hired

43:49.113 --> 43:50.514
the goddamn kid
in the first place.

43:50.581 --> 43:53.750
Be that as it may,
he'll use it against you.

43:53.818 --> 43:55.852
You need me.

43:55.920 --> 43:57.921
And I'm not staying
without Mike.

44:04.662 --> 44:05.729
[Door slams]

44:05.796 --> 44:09.199
[Keys jingle, clatter]

44:27.385 --> 44:29.886
Hey, Mike, it's Rachel.

44:29.954 --> 44:31.388
I know I shouldn't be
doing this,

44:31.455 --> 44:33.356
and I-I know
you're seeing Jenny,

44:33.424 --> 44:36.026
but I can't stop thinking
about the kiss.

44:36.093 --> 44:38.361
And... I can't go back.

44:38.429 --> 44:41.898
[Phone beeps]

44:41.966 --> 44:45.302
- Hello--
- Get your ass in here.

44:45.369 --> 44:47.637
On my way.

44:55.179 --> 44:58.982
[Clears throat]

44:59.050 --> 45:00.650
[Exhales]

45:15.132 --> 45:19.169
I thought--

45:19.237 --> 45:20.570
Harvey said
he wanted to see me.

45:20.638 --> 45:22.205
He said,
"Get your ass in here."

45:22.273 --> 45:24.307
Am I fired?

45:24.375 --> 45:27.744
You should be.

45:27.812 --> 45:29.446
That imply that I'm not?

45:29.513 --> 45:31.147
Not necessarily.

45:31.215 --> 45:35.485
However, if I'm going
to accept this situation...

45:35.553 --> 45:38.655
then I want to know everything
there is to know.

45:38.723 --> 45:40.857
Okay.

45:40.925 --> 45:41.992
Where do I start?

45:42.059 --> 45:43.526
Why don't you tell me

45:43.594 --> 45:46.630
how the hell you got Harvey
to hire you in the first place.

45:46.697 --> 45:49.933
Fire up that laptop
and I'll show you.

45:50.001 --> 45:53.436
Ask me anything there is
to know about the law.

45:53.504 --> 45:56.339
That's how you did it?

45:56.407 --> 46:01.177
You beat him?

46:01.245 --> 46:04.481
Well, I'm not Harvey.

46:08.185 --> 46:11.021
I don't need a computer.
