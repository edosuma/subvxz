WEBVTT

00:04.906 --> 00:07.775
- Hey! How 'bout this one here?!
- What one?

00:07.826 --> 00:10.411
This little one!
It's adorb-able.

00:10.479 --> 00:13.152
Steven, the
legendary glass of time

00:13.153 --> 00:15.762
won't be nearly so
small and insignificant.

00:15.763 --> 00:18.359
It'll be beautiful and
grand, like this one!

00:18.360 --> 00:21.088
- I think it's this one.
- Whoa!

00:21.123 --> 00:23.090
You mean the biggest one?!

00:23.125 --> 00:26.043
<i>How are we even supposed to get
that back to the warp pad?</i>

00:26.128 --> 00:28.012
- I can carry it.
- Wait!

00:28.096 --> 00:29.964
We need to be careful
which one we touch!

00:30.048 --> 00:32.183
You remember what happened
last time we were here.

00:32.267 --> 00:34.602
- What happened?
- Hey, guys!

00:34.636 --> 00:36.971
I'm makin' the call, and it's
this janky one here!

00:37.055 --> 00:39.607
Amethyst!

00:39.691 --> 00:44.111
Uh...
Nope, it wasn't.

00:44.146 --> 00:45.980
- Look out!
- Whoa! Ugh!

00:46.064 --> 00:47.648
We don't have much time!

00:47.733 --> 00:49.700
- Amethyst, come on!
- Steven!

00:49.785 --> 00:51.652
W-Where do you think you're going?!

00:51.737 --> 00:53.204
Amethyst gets to keep hers!

00:53.288 --> 00:56.468
- Darn tootin'!
- I'm gonna get the one I picked out!

00:56.469 --> 00:57.804
<i>- Steven!
- Steven!</i>

00:57.805 --> 00:59.493
My name's Steven.

00:59.578 --> 01:01.962
- You're gonna live with me.
- Steven, come on!

01:01.997 --> 01:03.748
I'm a-comin'!

01:03.832 --> 01:06.500
I'm a-comin'!

01:06.551 --> 01:07.685
Hang on.

01:08.637 --> 01:12.006
- Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.
- Gotcha.

01:12.057 --> 01:14.873
Well done, Garnet!

01:18.179 --> 01:20.147
Hot potato!

01:20.215 --> 01:23.601
- We're doing that again, right?!
- Unfortunately, we'll

01:23.685 --> 01:25.964
have to wait another
hundred years for the

01:25.965 --> 01:28.297
sea shrine to reform
'cause somebody couldn't

01:28.298 --> 01:29.907
keep their hands to themselves.

01:30.025 --> 01:32.193
You have a lobster on your butt.

01:32.244 --> 01:34.245
Huh? Eee!

01:34.329 --> 01:36.580
Beach-a-palooza!

01:36.665 --> 01:38.616
- Beach-a-wha-whozaa?
- Palooza.

01:38.700 --> 01:40.534
That was a lot of fun, you guys.

01:40.585 --> 01:43.120
I'll see you later!
After you, sir.

01:43.205 --> 01:44.405
Buh-bye!

01:48.465 --> 01:49.760
Yep.

01:49.878 --> 01:51.762
- Mm-hmm.
- Dad! Dad!

01:51.880 --> 01:53.881
Are you ready to rehearse?
Whoa!

01:53.965 --> 01:56.217
Uhh...
We're having a bit of a day.

01:56.284 --> 01:58.269
- Is it stuck?
- Yeah.

01:58.353 --> 02:01.021
Why does a boat need
a car wash?

02:01.056 --> 02:02.556
Huh!

02:02.941 --> 02:05.309
Sorry, buddy.
I don't think I can play

02:05.393 --> 02:07.895
in the concert tonight.
I got to deal with this.

02:07.979 --> 02:10.731
You're bailing on
beach-a-palooza?!

02:10.816 --> 02:14.869
- But the whole town's gonna be there!
- Steven, that's like 15 people.

02:14.936 --> 02:18.656
Next time, bud, I promise.
All right, maybe if you bring it

02:18.740 --> 02:21.067
- forward a little bit.
- Stupid boat gettin' all stuck.

02:21.068 --> 02:22.543
Nobody likes you, boat!

02:22.577 --> 02:25.880
Wish I could've been there to
tell my dad you were too fat!

02:25.964 --> 02:29.250
That's it. Just back her in.

02:29.301 --> 02:32.219
- She'll definitely fit.
- What the...

02:32.254 --> 02:34.755
- Dad! Dad!
- Hey, Stu-ball.

02:34.890 --> 02:38.159
- You excited for beach-a-palooza!
- Dad! Dad!

02:38.226 --> 02:40.094
Fat, it's fat!
Fat, fat, fat!

02:40.178 --> 02:42.763
- Rude!
- Not you! The boat!

02:42.848 --> 02:45.099
- The boat!
- Huh? Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

02:45.183 --> 02:46.600
- Stop!
- Huh?

02:46.668 --> 02:48.658
Nice catch, Steven!

02:49.738 --> 02:52.773
The thing!
You took me back in time,

02:52.824 --> 02:54.241
didn't you?!
Oh, man.

02:54.276 --> 02:57.328
Pearl's gonna flip when she
finds out you were the real one!

02:57.412 --> 02:59.697
Look, I'm sorry, but the
boat's fat!

02:59.781 --> 03:01.866
Oh, no! Your truck!

03:01.950 --> 03:03.868
Oh! Whoa!

03:06.087 --> 03:07.245
Gotta save the van!

03:07.246 --> 03:10.758
I wish I could go back and
stop myself from stopping my dad!

03:10.792 --> 03:13.844
That's it. Just back her in.

03:13.929 --> 03:17.181
- She'll definitely fit.
- What the...

03:17.265 --> 03:19.266
Dad! Dad!

03:19.351 --> 03:20.968
What?

03:21.019 --> 03:23.137
- Shh!
- Future Steven?

03:23.221 --> 03:25.606
Listen,
two-minutes-ago Steven.

03:25.640 --> 03:27.975
We can't go around trying to
change time stuff.

03:28.109 --> 03:30.311
It just makes things worse!

03:30.362 --> 03:33.113
- Oh, no! How did this happen?!
- Aww, man.

03:33.198 --> 03:35.616
I really wanted to play at
beach-a-palooza!

03:35.650 --> 03:37.651
Too bad you and I can't be in a band.

03:37.702 --> 03:39.895
<i>Wait a minute!</i>

03:41.856 --> 03:44.658

03:44.709 --> 03:47.161
Steven?

03:47.245 --> 03:50.748
Steven?
What's going on?

03:50.832 --> 03:53.667
- No time to explain!
- Wanna join our band?!

03:53.752 --> 03:57.197
Yes! But didn't
dad say he would play with us?

03:57.232 --> 03:59.137
He had an
emergency at the car wash.

03:59.138 --> 04:01.308
- We should go help him!
- No!

04:01.343 --> 04:03.844
There's nothing we can do.
The boat's fat, trust us.

04:03.929 --> 04:05.846
Okay, so, who's our fourth?

04:05.897 --> 04:08.638
- We need a drummer.
- Not a problem, Steven.

05:45.246 --> 05:46.830
