00:01.026 --> 00:02.646
Coo. Coo.

00:02.646 --> 00:05.276
Coo coo coo.

00:05.276 --> 00:07.606
Coo-coo!

00:07.606 --> 00:10.026
[all cooing]

00:12.896 --> 00:15.066
Is-Is this a bad time?

00:15.066 --> 00:16.816
Oh, Janna.
[chuckles]

00:16.816 --> 00:18.446
You'll have to pardon me.

00:18.446 --> 00:20.146
I'm just brushing up
on my pigeon

00:20.146 --> 00:22.776
for the dinner party tonight
with the rich pigeons.

00:22.776 --> 00:24.686
Thank you for offering
to babysit.

00:24.686 --> 00:27.106
[baby talk]

00:27.106 --> 00:29.186
Hey, anything for
the Queen of Darkness.

00:29.186 --> 00:32.486
I would've asked M-A-R-C-O,

00:32.486 --> 00:35.816
but I get the sense
she doesn't like him
very much.

00:35.816 --> 00:38.146
Yeah, who can blame her?
Marco!

00:38.146 --> 00:39.526
[roars]

00:39.526 --> 00:42.146
[chuckles]
Exactly.

00:42.146 --> 00:45.686
Ooh. She really does
take after her father,
doesn't she?

00:45.686 --> 00:49.686
You be good, my darling.

00:49.686 --> 00:51.316
I'll be back by 8:00.

00:51.316 --> 00:53.986
If you're not,
I charge double
for overtime.

00:53.986 --> 00:57.686
Well,
let the babysitting begin.

00:57.686 --> 01:00.486
[video game beeping]

01:00.486 --> 01:03.146
[giggling]

01:03.146 --> 01:05.316
-[Glossaryck] Psst! Meteora.
-Hmm?

01:05.316 --> 01:07.776
Down here.

01:07.776 --> 01:09.856
Hello, Princess.

01:09.856 --> 01:12.066
[exclaims]

01:12.066 --> 01:13.396
Oh, geez.

01:13.396 --> 01:16.066
You would not believe
the day I've had today.

01:16.066 --> 01:17.396
[exclaims]

01:17.396 --> 01:19.816
Oh! Oh, yeah, yeah.
My arm.

01:19.816 --> 01:23.186
Just a little boo-boo.
Nothing to really worry about.

01:23.186 --> 01:24.606
[sobbing]

01:24.606 --> 01:27.356
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't cry.

01:27.356 --> 01:30.106
Your buddy Glossaryck's okay.
Look. Look.

01:30.106 --> 01:33.236
I've got another arm.
Plus I've got a silly hat.

01:33.236 --> 01:35.186
[baby talk]

01:35.186 --> 01:36.986
Now, as your guide

01:36.986 --> 01:39.146
to all magical matters,

01:39.146 --> 01:41.316
are you ready to continue
our lessons?

01:41.316 --> 01:43.776
-[exclaims happily]
-Have you been practicing

01:43.776 --> 01:46.606
the "dip down" exercises
I taught you?

01:46.606 --> 01:48.816
Dee-daa!

01:48.816 --> 01:50.736
No, no.
A little longer

01:50.736 --> 01:52.356
and a little louder.

01:53.566 --> 01:56.186
Di-i-i-i-i-i...

01:56.186 --> 01:58.526
No, no, no.
That-That's all wrong.

01:58.526 --> 02:01.106
It's just "dip down."
Two short words.

02:01.106 --> 02:05.816
Di-i-i-i-i-i...

02:05.816 --> 02:07.946
No. Now-Now you're
just getting louder.

02:07.946 --> 02:10.736
No, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

02:10.736 --> 02:13.816
I know how much joy
this brings you.

02:13.816 --> 02:15.146
Let's get going.

02:17.236 --> 02:19.186
[exclaims]

02:19.186 --> 02:21.986
Wait. Wait!
Don't go in there without me.

02:21.986 --> 02:24.186
-[game beeping]
-[muttering]

02:24.186 --> 02:28.686
Oh! Triple
burger bonus! Yes!

02:28.686 --> 02:31.146
Welcome...

02:31.146 --> 02:33.986
to the Plains
of Time.

02:33.986 --> 02:36.186
To complete your lesson,
we got to go back in time.

02:36.186 --> 02:39.276
And we need Father Time
for that.

02:40.486 --> 02:41.816
[exclaims]

02:41.816 --> 02:43.396
Oh, yes. Yes, yes.

02:43.396 --> 02:45.236
I can go back in time.

02:45.236 --> 02:47.276
But I can't take
a passenger with me.

02:47.276 --> 02:48.986
That's why we need
Father Time.

02:50.276 --> 02:51.486
Where is he?

02:51.486 --> 02:53.896
[wind gusting]

02:53.896 --> 02:56.606
[ticking]

02:56.606 --> 02:58.316
[baby talk]

02:58.316 --> 03:01.026
Yes, of course I knew
he wasn't going to be here.

03:01.026 --> 03:04.066
If he was here,
it would've been easy,

03:04.066 --> 03:05.566
and you wouldn't
learn anything.

03:05.566 --> 03:07.236
[baby talk]

03:07.236 --> 03:10.776
Um, sure, there's
another way to time travel.

03:10.776 --> 03:13.316
I just, uh...

03:13.316 --> 03:16.276
I really don't want to see
Reynaldo today.

03:16.276 --> 03:18.396
[baby talk]

03:18.396 --> 03:20.276
Reynaldo the Baldpate,

03:20.276 --> 03:22.066
ferryman of
the River of Time.

03:22.066 --> 03:24.236
Uh... Okay.

03:24.236 --> 03:26.446
Let's just get it over with.

03:26.446 --> 03:28.316
Look, look, he's gonna
talk and stuff.

03:28.316 --> 03:31.896
Uh, just...
don't interact, okay?

03:31.896 --> 03:33.646
[exclaims]

03:33.646 --> 03:36.276
All right, Meteora,
pull up a seat.

03:36.276 --> 03:38.736
This might take a while.
Sometimes--

03:38.736 --> 03:41.396
[cries out]
You know what?

03:41.396 --> 03:43.446
Never mind!
He's here!

03:43.446 --> 03:46.276
For passage through
my timely sea,

03:46.276 --> 03:48.316
this question
you must answer me.

03:48.316 --> 03:50.776
Who speaks in rhyme
and wanders time

03:50.776 --> 03:53.276
with none to call
his family?

03:53.276 --> 03:54.946
No phone calls, cards or--

03:54.946 --> 03:57.276
Thank you, Reynaldo.
Please be quiet.
Just,

03:57.276 --> 03:59.736
we're in a hurry,
and we need to get going.

03:59.736 --> 04:02.106
What doth bring you
to my land?

04:02.106 --> 04:04.686
A passage through time,
swift and grand?

04:04.686 --> 04:08.236
Up-bup-bup-bup!
We don't have time
for riddles today.

04:08.236 --> 04:10.486
Princess Meteora and I
need to go back.

04:10.486 --> 04:12.896
An inch, a pinch,
the years unravel.

04:12.896 --> 04:15.316
How far dost thou
wish to travel?

04:15.316 --> 04:17.446
The length of something
short and flat,

04:17.446 --> 04:20.316
-or perhaps something--
-We just need to go...

04:20.316 --> 04:22.736
to the Age of Butterflies.

04:22.736 --> 04:24.856
With haste we must depart
this place

04:24.856 --> 04:27.356
and skim the flow
of time and space.

04:27.356 --> 04:29.736
Away we go
and briskly float.

04:29.736 --> 04:32.396
We ride, us three,
upon a...

04:32.396 --> 04:33.896
Boat.

04:33.896 --> 04:35.896
And boom goes the dynamite.

04:35.896 --> 04:38.566
At this point, I don't even know
what you're getting out of this.

04:38.566 --> 04:41.026
What's dank and musky
like a foot

04:41.026 --> 04:43.526
and falls apart
when overcooked?

04:43.526 --> 04:45.986
In soups and stews
this foulness lingers.

04:45.986 --> 04:49.236
If you must touch,
don't smell your fingers.

04:49.236 --> 04:51.776
Meteora, I really
must apologize.

04:51.776 --> 04:53.986
Father Time's wheel
would've been so much faster

04:53.986 --> 04:56.356
and less...
Reynaldo.

04:56.356 --> 04:59.566
But why don't you practice
your "dip-down"

04:59.566 --> 05:00.646
while we're waiting?

05:00.646 --> 05:02.896
Dee-daa!
[exclaims]

05:02.896 --> 05:05.686
Dee-daa!
Dee-daa!

05:05.686 --> 05:07.186
Okay, that's good.

05:07.186 --> 05:09.526
But try it
with more emotion.

05:09.526 --> 05:11.356
[exclaims]

05:11.356 --> 05:13.686
A-All right.
You're getting closer.

05:13.686 --> 05:16.776
I can fill a room
or just one heart.

05:16.776 --> 05:19.736
I cannot be shared,
only apart.

05:19.736 --> 05:22.396
-What am I?
-Loneliness.

05:22.396 --> 05:25.776
Ah. You want to
get back on the Magical
High Commission.

05:25.776 --> 05:28.946
-[whinnies]
-I don't think so, Reynaldo.

05:28.946 --> 05:31.986
The riddle thing, it's...
Look.

05:31.986 --> 05:34.566
Just because I created
the commission doesn't mean
they listen to me.

05:34.566 --> 05:36.526
[sighs]

05:36.526 --> 05:38.896
You have arrived
at the time you seek.

05:38.896 --> 05:40.316
Okay, great.
Thank you!

05:40.316 --> 05:42.106
Come on.
Let's go, Meteora.

05:43.446 --> 05:45.776
Bye.... Dad.

05:49.606 --> 05:53.026
[groans]
Oh, my goodness.

05:53.026 --> 05:56.186
They keep you well fed,
don't they.

05:56.186 --> 05:59.316
All right. Are you ready
for your lesson?

05:59.316 --> 06:02.816
'Cause we're he...
Oh, no.

06:02.816 --> 06:05.186
-Waa! Waa!
-Waa! Waa!

06:05.186 --> 06:06.776
Waa! Waa!

06:06.776 --> 06:09.066
[shuddering]

06:09.066 --> 06:11.856
Wh-Where are we?

06:11.856 --> 06:13.566
Who are we?

06:13.566 --> 06:16.446
[groans]
Reynaldo brought us
back too far.

06:16.446 --> 06:17.946
Let's go, Meteora.

06:17.946 --> 06:20.606
Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

06:20.606 --> 06:22.486
Do you...

06:22.486 --> 06:24.446
Do you know who we are?

06:24.446 --> 06:27.316
Uh... yes.

06:27.316 --> 06:28.986
Can you help us?

06:28.986 --> 06:30.896
[groans]
Fine.

06:30.896 --> 06:33.686
Let's just do the abbreviated
version here.

06:33.686 --> 06:38.396
A long time ago arrived
the first settlers of Mewni.

06:38.396 --> 06:39.606
That's you.

06:39.606 --> 06:41.486
-Wow!
-Whoa!

06:41.486 --> 06:44.066
A modest people
with noble pursuits--

06:44.066 --> 06:47.236
life, liberty
and... corn.

06:47.236 --> 06:48.446
The end.

06:48.446 --> 06:50.356
Oh.

06:50.356 --> 06:53.446
One more thing.
Mind if I borrow your rattle?

06:56.026 --> 06:58.066
[yawns]

07:06.896 --> 07:09.356
Eenie, meenie,
Mewni, moe.

07:09.356 --> 07:10.986
Okay, you, Moe.
Here you go.

07:10.986 --> 07:12.446
Uh...

07:14.526 --> 07:16.356
Ooh!

07:16.356 --> 07:18.026
Congratulations!

07:18.026 --> 07:20.736
-You can do magic
with that thing.
-Okay.

07:20.736 --> 07:24.896
Come on, Meteora.
We've got to hitch another ride
with my weird son.

07:24.896 --> 07:27.566
Oh, and another
one more thing.

07:27.566 --> 07:29.276
There's a storm coming,

07:29.276 --> 07:31.236
so y'all might want to
huddle around that stump.

07:31.236 --> 07:33.646
[thunder crashes]

07:33.646 --> 07:35.686
Through darkness, slumbers,

07:35.686 --> 07:38.236
toils, solemnly alone,

07:38.236 --> 07:42.236
no game of catch,
no father, no home.

07:42.236 --> 07:43.986
-Hey, Reynaldo?
-Father!

07:43.986 --> 07:47.446
Yeah. Can we just go forward
in time a bit? Thanks.

07:47.446 --> 07:49.986
Thou makest haste like wind,
we shall arrive and--

07:49.986 --> 07:52.646
[Glossaryck]
Oh, geez, just go.
Just go.

07:54.356 --> 07:56.896
[sighs]
Here's a free extra
lesson for you--

07:56.896 --> 07:59.986
Don't have children.
[chuckles]
Oh, looks like we're here.

08:02.026 --> 08:05.526
Boss, is this
really necessary?

08:05.526 --> 08:07.646
Rasticore, if you're
too weak for this,

08:07.646 --> 08:09.606
you'll never survive
against a Mewman.

08:09.606 --> 08:11.026
Do it.

08:11.026 --> 08:13.316
[screaming]

08:13.316 --> 08:15.566
Oh. It's kinda tingly.

08:15.566 --> 08:18.776
Great. On to the last
part of your lesson.

08:18.776 --> 08:21.106
Now, they may
have magic,

08:21.106 --> 08:23.316
but we are invincible.

08:23.316 --> 08:25.776
-[Glossaryck] Hey, Toffee!
-Who said that?

08:25.776 --> 08:27.896
Oh.
Hello again.

08:27.896 --> 08:29.776
Sorry for interrupting
your weird meeting,

08:29.776 --> 08:31.776
but I'm trying to teach
this little girl a lesson.

08:31.776 --> 08:34.776
What are you
trying to teach her?
How to get your arm broken?

08:34.776 --> 08:37.026
[all laughing]

08:37.026 --> 08:38.776
[baby talk]

08:38.776 --> 08:41.646
Yep, that's the bad boy
who broke my arm.

08:41.646 --> 08:44.736
-[snarls]
-Whoa. Hold your horses.

08:44.736 --> 08:48.026
I'm sure Toffee had
a good reason for
doing what he did.

08:48.026 --> 08:50.986
You were making
that stupid leaf hat,
so I snapped your arm.

08:50.986 --> 08:53.316
Okay.
Not the best reason.

08:53.316 --> 08:55.646
But that doesn't mean
he has to keep doing
terrible things.

08:55.646 --> 08:59.276
If he did,
he'd... break my other arm.

08:59.276 --> 09:01.776
Oh, that's a good idea.

09:01.776 --> 09:04.356
[exclaims, snarling]

09:07.686 --> 09:10.776
Maybe that baby isn't the one
who needs to be taught a lesson.

09:10.776 --> 09:13.106
Maybe we came
to teach you.

09:13.106 --> 09:15.896
Well, what are you
going to teach me?

09:24.566 --> 09:26.566
[shouts]

09:28.646 --> 09:30.896
Okay.
That's enough, Meteora.

09:30.896 --> 09:32.646
-Meteora!
-[giggles]

09:34.146 --> 09:36.606
-[thud]
-[giggles]

09:36.606 --> 09:39.026
[gasps]

09:39.026 --> 09:41.566
See?
This is the threat of magic.

09:41.566 --> 09:44.776
This is what
we're at war against.

09:44.776 --> 09:47.236
I guess you learned
two lessons today--

09:47.236 --> 09:49.396
how to "dip down,"

09:49.396 --> 09:51.816
and that jerks like him
never learn.

09:51.816 --> 09:53.816
[exclaims]

09:53.816 --> 09:55.276
-[electronic beeping]
-Not again!

09:55.276 --> 09:58.446
Ugh. Now I got to restart
from the pickle factory.

09:58.446 --> 10:00.526
[electronic beeping]

10:02.186 --> 10:03.856
-[door opens]
-Oh, hey.

10:03.856 --> 10:05.986
How did it go?
Any trouble?

10:05.986 --> 10:09.146
Yeah, I keep getting stuck
on this one jump on level 43.

10:09.146 --> 10:11.856
