WOMAN: You have now come
to the end of your second semester.

01:07.943 --> 01:11.094
Some of you will remain here
to complete your education.

01:11.154 --> 01:13.722
Some of you will go out into the world.

01:13.782 --> 01:15.641
And, as is my custom,

01:15.701 --> 01:19.686
I put to you a question
of the utmost importance,

01:19.746 --> 01:22.739
which concerns your spiritual wellbeing.

01:24.751 --> 01:27.994
Do you wish to come to God and be saved?

01:30.257 --> 01:34.672
Those of you who wish to be Christian
and saved will move to my right.

01:43.145 --> 01:47.014
To those of you who remain
and hope to be saved...

01:48.233 --> 01:49.940
you will move to my left.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.188
Have you said your prayers?

02:03.248 --> 02:04.940
Yes.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.526
Though it can't make much
difference to the Creator.

02:07.586 --> 02:10.152
Do I understand you correctly?

02:10.213 --> 02:14.700
Do you believe that your Creator is
indifferent to your sins?

02:14.760 --> 02:17.218
That, in His mercy, He sees you slumber?

02:17.971 --> 02:20.759
No, you misunderstand me.
I've not got so far.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.876
I am not even awakened yet.

02:24.936 --> 02:27.296
And how should I repent?

02:27.356 --> 02:29.923
I am somewhat troubled, to be sure,

02:29.983 --> 02:32.134
but my feelings are all indefinite.

02:32.194 --> 02:34.845
The question is not
how far you have advanced,

02:34.905 --> 02:37.055
but how far you ought to have advanced.

02:37.115 --> 02:39.224
Not how you feel, but how you ought to feel.

02:39.284 --> 02:41.852
I don't feel anything.

02:41.912 --> 02:44.950
I have no sense of my sins. And how can I?

02:46.792 --> 02:51.570
I wish I could feel as others do,
but it is not possible.

02:51.630 --> 02:55.907
A sinner against a Holy God
and under condemnation,

02:55.967 --> 03:01.163
and liable every moment to drop
into a burning hopeless eternity,

03:01.223 --> 03:04.124
yet cannot feel, cannot be alarmed,

03:04.184 --> 03:06.892
cannot "flee from the wrath to come".

03:08.522 --> 03:10.559
And the true question is...

03:11.692 --> 03:14.435
Are you in the Ark of Safety?

03:16.697 --> 03:18.654
I fear I am not.

03:19.533 --> 03:23.618

too fatiguing for her.

- An acute case of evangelism.

I do not like to see a woman upon the stage.

06:11.162 --> 06:12.896
But she has a gift.

06:12.956 --> 06:17.484
A gift is no excuse for a female
to exhibit herself in that way.

And what would you have her do?
Perform an act of congress aloud?

06:22.841 --> 06:25.200

- Of course.

08:14.953 --> 08:16.895
As you may know, I like to write.

I was nearly kept waiting.

10:14.739 --> 10:16.806
And what is your opinion of my poem, Emily?

10:16.866 --> 10:19.768
I'm sure your verse is equal
to your talent, Aunt.

10:19.828 --> 10:23.730
If I were clever enough, I should probably
take offence at that dubious compliment.

10:23.790 --> 10:27.901
Oh, but, Aunt, all the best compliments
are dubious.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.294
That's part of their charm.

10:32.507 --> 10:34.908
Did you enjoy my verses, Austin?

10:34.968 --> 10:39.053
Very much, Aunt.
They put Paradise Lost to shame.

10:40.598 --> 10:43.291
Your children are far too sophisticated,
Edward.

10:43.351 --> 10:45.460
I'm sure part of me disapproves.

10:45.520 --> 10:48.254
- Disapproval is a heavy thing.
- Oh.

10:48.314 --> 10:51.633
Besides, if I had to choose between
having sophisticated children

10:51.693 --> 10:53.760
and ones that were merely docile,

10:53.820 --> 10:56.471
I should choose the former.

10:56.531 --> 11:00.600
- Docility is too much like slavery.
- That sounds like abolitionist talk.

11:00.660 --> 11:04.187
No, it is not. But no Christian
could ever make a case for slavery.

Yes.

11:34.569 --> 11:36.606
In the Springfield Republican.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.015
It... it was printed anonymously.

11:41.075 --> 11:43.317

probably a good thing.

for the eternity which surrounds us all.

Here, Aunt.

12:18.529 --> 12:20.889
AUNT ELIZABETH: And what of you?

12:20.949 --> 12:25.852
Oh, I am like Pilgrim, trying to improve.

12:25.912 --> 12:29.606
A pilgrim should only ever be conscious
of other people's self-improvement.

12:29.666 --> 12:32.483
Consciousness of his own is mere vanity.

12:32.543 --> 12:37.113
But, Aunt, vanity is such a harmless vice.

12:37.173 --> 12:39.240
It's as shallow as
the people who indulge in it.

12:39.300 --> 12:41.910
No vice is harmless, Vinnie.

12:41.970 --> 12:44.508
Look no further than Babylon for that.

12:47.058 --> 12:50.585

- Oh, I'm on no pilgrimage at all.

12:50.645 --> 12:52.253
And what of vice?

12:52.313 --> 12:55.590

Oh, I prefer to listen and remain silent.

13:03.366 --> 13:07.310
That way, a prejudice
doesn't seem like an opinion.

I'm none the wiser.

- Yes, I thought it had a military ring to it.

21:14.398 --> 21:16.048
But that was years ago.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.342

ecclesiastical history.

the same educational advantages as men.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.825

A unique combination of both.

already given Himself to me.

37:39.299 --> 37:42.701
he will think he has married
one of the minor Borgias.

37:42.761 --> 37:44.548
(CHUCKLES)

37:47.515 --> 37:48.881
Will you marry?

37:49.642 --> 37:51.759
I only want my family.

37:54.189 --> 37:56.881
It is not perfect.

37:56.941 --> 37:58.933
It is not Paradise.

38:00.779 --> 38:03.362
But it is far better
than anything I could know.

38:04.699 --> 38:06.565
Or want.

38:13.124 --> 38:15.286
When you do marry...

38:16.669 --> 38:19.537
- I shall miss you.
- Of course you shall miss me.

38:20.590 --> 38:22.490
I refuse to be forgotten.

38:22.550 --> 38:24.507
(LAUGHS)

38:25.261 --> 38:27.120
VINNIE: Emily.

38:27.180 --> 38:30.457
Make sure your bread is ready
for the agricultural fair tomorrow.

38:30.517 --> 38:32.804
Yes. I haven't forgotten.

38:35.939 --> 38:37.896
They feel swollen.

38:39.400 --> 38:42.734
They are swollen, like my feet.

38:44.364 --> 38:46.151
(GASPS)

38:47.617 --> 38:49.358
Oh!

Aah! (GASPING)

(EMILY GASPS)

39:12.308 --> 39:13.917
Miss Emily?

39:13.977 --> 39:16.890
Will you please get my bread out of the oven?

39:22.402 --> 39:24.359
It doesn't need all three of you
to pick it up!

39:32.662 --> 39:36.952
I believe you spoke sharply to Thomas,
Margaret and Maggie yesterday.

39:38.084 --> 39:42.070
- Yes, Father.
- They must be treated with respect.

39:42.130 --> 39:44.543
They are not servants, but employees.

39:56.853 --> 39:58.837
What was that for?

39:58.897 --> 40:02.811
For pointing out so eloquently
the distinction between the two.

40:05.528 --> 40:08.145
I was very impolite yesterday.

40:09.657 --> 40:12.491
I would like to apologise
to all three of you.

40:13.912 --> 40:16.145
Er, no offence taken.

40:16.205 --> 40:19.399
Then may I take it that I am forgiven?

40:19.459 --> 40:22.293
For I am truly sorry.

40:23.796 --> 40:25.738
But we have good news, miss.

40:25.798 --> 40:28.741
Your bread won five dollars.

40:28.801 --> 40:32.787
Then you must keep the money.
It will ease my conscience.

40:32.847 --> 40:35.214
MARGARET: It took second prize.

40:36.309 --> 40:39.848
Oh. Second prize.

40:42.523 --> 40:45.186
What does it feel like to be a father,
Austin?

40:46.152 --> 40:47.313
Fatherly.

40:50.365 --> 40:51.697
May I hold him?

40:56.496 --> 40:58.533
(BABY GURGLES)

41:09.968 --> 41:12.881
- We're calling him Edward.
- Ned, for short.

41:13.763 --> 41:16.506
I'm nobody! Who are you?

41:18.309 --> 41:20.346
Are you nobody, too?

41:21.396 --> 41:25.173
Then there's a pair of us - don't tell!

41:25.233 --> 41:27.467
They'd banish us, you know.

41:27.527 --> 41:30.845
How dreary to be somebody!

41:30.905 --> 41:34.515
How public, like a frog

41:34.575 --> 41:37.018
To tell one's name the livelong day

41:37.078 --> 41:38.910
To an admiring bog!

41:43.084 --> 41:45.201
AUSTIN: Father? What is it?

41:50.508 --> 41:52.533
Fort Sumter has been fired upon.

41:52.593 --> 41:54.585
What does this mean?

41:55.513 --> 41:59.006
It is thought that
the South will secede from the Union.

42:00.518 --> 42:02.043
Then it means civil war.

42:02.103 --> 42:04.671
Does this mean you will be drafted, Austin?

42:04.731 --> 42:06.518
Almost certainly.

42:08.609 --> 42:10.301
You will remain here.

42:10.361 --> 42:12.637
But, Father, my friends will fight.
I cannot stay at home.

42:12.697 --> 42:17.141
I will pay the $500 bond so that
a substitute may fight in your place.

42:17.201 --> 42:22.021
- What about my honour, sir?
- Your honour, sir, will be safe in my hands.

42:22.081 --> 42:24.023
And my conscience, Father? What of that?

42:24.083 --> 42:28.903
It will be best if your conscience
found solace in you doing your filial duty.

42:28.963 --> 42:33.616
For those who will die in this civil war,
"filial duty" will seem like cowardice.

42:33.676 --> 42:35.743
No young man of breeding
would make such a remark.

42:35.803 --> 42:37.965
No gentleman would provoke it!

42:40.641 --> 42:42.598

- Austin.

42:45.104 --> 42:47.096
You are my only son.

42:48.900 --> 42:51.050
I cannot see your life put at risk.

42:51.110 --> 42:54.762
Please, Father, don't make me stay.

42:54.822 --> 42:57.906
You are not to go! I forbid it!

43:01.704 --> 43:03.491

43:04.707 --> 43:06.744
I will remain here.

But gallanter, I know

43:27.897 --> 43:32.267

The Cavalry of Woe -

Whose dying eyes, no Country
Regards with patriot love -

We trust, in plumed procession,
For such, the Angels go -

Rank after Rank, with even feet -
And Uniforms of snow.

43:59.595 --> 44:01.632
(GUNFIRE)

44:05.184 --> 44:08.848
EMILY: There is a word which bears a sword

44:09.814 --> 44:12.465
Can pierce an armed man.

44:12.525 --> 44:17.361
It hurls its barbed syllables, -
And once is mute again.

44:18.531 --> 44:21.224
But where it fell, the saved will tell

44:21.284 --> 44:23.893
On patriotic day,

44:23.953 --> 44:27.663
Some epauletted brother gave his breath away

44:29.041 --> 44:33.251
Wherever runs the breathless sun,
Wherever roams the day,

44:34.297 --> 44:37.210
There is its noiseless onset,

44:38.217 --> 44:40.174
There its victory!

44:45.600 --> 44:48.668
AUSTIN: We went to Gettysburg
to hear the speeches.

44:48.728 --> 44:51.671
Mr Edward Everett spoke for nearly two hours.

44:51.731 --> 44:54.465
- SUSAN: Very rousing.
- EMILY: And the President's speech?

44:54.525 --> 44:56.676
AUSTIN: Mr Lincoln
was shocking in his brevity.

44:56.736 --> 44:58.886
He spoke for about three minutes.
Not memorable.

44:58.946 --> 45:01.180
VINNIE: Were there many there
to hear the orations?

45:01.240 --> 45:04.934
- SUSAN: Some said fifteen thousand.
- (EMILY SIGHS DEEPLY)

45:04.994 --> 45:08.729
AUSTIN: Most of them looking for breakfast,
or trying to find souvenirs of the battle.

45:08.789 --> 45:10.746
Macabre.

45:13.002 --> 45:16.612
They say that over
six hundred thousand men have perished.

45:16.672 --> 45:18.823
And for what?

45:18.883 --> 45:23.411
To end slavery, which should never have
flourished in this country in the first place.

45:23.471 --> 45:26.205
Miss Buffam has had
too great an influence over you, Emily.

45:26.265 --> 45:29.709
If more men were as outspoken as
Miss Buffam, we may not have had a war.

45:29.769 --> 45:35.006
How dare you trivialise it in that way?
The conflict was not about gender.

45:35.066 --> 45:39.093
Any argument about gender is war,
because that, too, is slavery.

45:39.153 --> 45:43.014
- That's a contemptible thing to say.
- Live as a woman for a week, Austin.

45:43.074 --> 45:45.908
You will find it neither congenial nor trivial.

45:57.129 --> 45:59.542
So you leave tomorrow?

46:01.884 --> 46:03.993
How long will you be gone?

46:04.053 --> 46:05.965
Two months, maybe.

46:07.098 --> 46:11.709
Both cases are difficult,
and both are being tried by Judge Lord.

A man must make his way in the world.
He can't be merely decorous.

46:23.864 --> 46:26.823
And a woman? What should she do?

46:27.952 --> 46:30.269
Or is she destined only for decorousness?

- Let's not argue.

My father allows it.

No husband would.

I came over.

47:41.233 --> 47:44.510
- I thought something was amiss.
- No.

It is the best time,

as if the whole world is asleep and still.

Why did you take so long
to consent to marry Austin?

48:08.761 --> 48:10.798
In truth...

48:14.100 --> 48:17.013
the thought of men in
that particular respect...

48:19.855 --> 48:22.017
turned me to stone.

48:26.946 --> 48:29.689
Although Austin is...

48:32.701 --> 48:35.353
very tender...

48:35.413 --> 48:37.450
and yielding to my...

48:40.751 --> 48:42.693
reservations.

48:42.753 --> 48:47.544
Is that particular part of married life
so terrible?

I do my duty.

We will be sisters.

49:32.761 --> 49:35.504
And you have your poetry.

But you have a life.

49:44.064 --> 49:46.226
I have a routine.

49:49.236 --> 49:52.320
It is God's one concession to a no-hoper.

49:53.157 --> 49:55.149
Does nothing give you solace?

50:04.251 --> 50:06.994
For those of us who live minor lives,

50:08.005 --> 50:10.213
and are deprived of...

50:14.094 --> 50:16.177
a particular kind of love,

50:18.474 --> 50:20.511
we know best how to starve.

50:29.693 --> 50:33.562
We deceive ourselves, and then others.

50:39.245 --> 50:41.737
It is the worst kind of lie.

50:58.138 --> 51:00.551
But in matters of the soul...

51:03.310 --> 51:05.097
you are rigorous.

51:07.314 --> 51:10.352
Rigour is no substitute for happiness.

51:14.947 --> 51:18.140
PASTOR: Oh, what a call is this?

51:18.200 --> 51:23.354
The dear ones, whose names are written
in the Lamb's Book of Life,

51:23.414 --> 51:27.024
cry "Come, come!"

51:27.084 --> 51:32.455
And the church below, Christ's witness
unto the world and the church above,

51:33.048 --> 51:35.115
with the rustling of the white robes,

51:35.175 --> 51:37.743
and the sweeping of the golden harps,

51:37.803 --> 51:40.887
cries "Come, come!"

51:42.016 --> 51:48.638
And the angels of Heaven, lo! Rank
above rank, immortal principalities,

51:49.732 --> 51:52.675
as they circle the eternal throne.

51:52.735 --> 52:00.609
They have caught up the sound,
and cry "Come, come!"

52:02.578 --> 52:06.272
Reverend Wadsworth's sermons
take the breath away!

52:06.332 --> 52:09.525
That kind of religious ecstasy is wonderful,

52:09.585 --> 52:11.735
but back in the quiet of one's own room,

52:11.795 --> 52:14.238
it seems as remote as Spitsbergen.

52:14.298 --> 52:17.908
Still, he is as handsome as he is ecstatic.

52:17.968 --> 52:21.704
And he is so clean.
Like a cherub after bathing.

(SIGHS) Ah, to be betrothed
without the swoon.

52:29.730 --> 52:31.505
But a person may hope.

If you're too quick to hope,
you'll always be disappointed.

52:35.027 --> 52:38.804
And if I am too quick to despair, what then?

52:38.864 --> 52:40.730
Then you will be too slow to hope.

52:41.950 --> 52:45.068
I set too much store by friendships.

52:46.080 --> 52:50.495
When we lose friends to death,
that is the most profound loss.

52:51.543 --> 52:57.039
When we lose them to marriage, the grief
is subtler, but just as keenly felt.

53:00.636 --> 53:05.623
We cannot keep the world, or life,
at bay, Emily. Neither can we ignore it.

53:05.683 --> 53:10.085
We can do better than that.
We can be vigilant against it.

53:10.145 --> 53:12.307
But when that vigil is over, what then?

53:13.982 --> 53:17.843
Eternity. And in that place, no loss is felt.

53:17.903 --> 53:20.012
But what of the kingdom to come?

53:20.072 --> 53:24.783
That may be a gain, but only after the fact.

One day, you may marry.

54:25.512 --> 54:28.455
No, thank you. Mrs Wadsworth is an abstainer.

54:28.515 --> 54:31.083
I thought abstention was only for alcohol.

54:31.143 --> 54:33.510
For me, it extends to tea, also.

54:37.941 --> 54:42.594
They say the Chinese drink tea
for remedial purposes.

54:42.654 --> 54:45.772
I'm glad to say that I'm not Chinese.

54:50.621 --> 54:52.896
Some lemonade, then?

54:52.956 --> 54:55.190
Surely God would not disapprove of lemonade?

54:55.250 --> 55:01.042
Levity and the will of God are, I think,
incompatible. Almost improper.

Just plain water would be pleasant.

Mr Longfellow, for instance.

56:07.531 --> 56:09.640
His genius lies in stating the obvious.

Oh, that is too harsh.
There are many fine things in Hiawatha.

I'm sorry I was cruel.
But, madam, I must say in truth,

56:18.709 --> 56:23.295
Hiawatha is but gruel.
Read just one stanza for the proof.

56:25.716 --> 56:28.033
No.

56:28.093 --> 56:32.337
Give me something pressed
from truth, and that is poetry.

56:33.640 --> 56:35.833
I suppose you feel the Brontës do that?

56:35.893 --> 56:38.794
Yes. And a few others.

56:38.854 --> 56:42.222
MRS WADSWORTH:
What do you find in all that Yorkshire gloom?

56:43.275 --> 56:47.594
The beauty of truth. The poetry of the known.

56:47.654 --> 56:49.805
But why can't they dwell
on something wholesome?

56:49.865 --> 56:54.030
If they wished to be wholesome,
I would imagine they would crochet.

57:00.751 --> 57:03.619
Would you like to take a turn in our garden?

57:05.505 --> 57:07.990
No, thank you.

57:08.050 --> 57:09.992
I find this heat oppressive.

57:10.052 --> 57:12.544
But Charles loves to be out of doors.

57:13.680 --> 57:15.998
I myself prefer the shade.

57:16.058 --> 57:19.042
In that case, I will take the liberty

57:19.102 --> 57:22.129
of escorting your husband
around our modest garden.

57:22.189 --> 57:25.648
And my sister can have you all to herself.

57:44.544 --> 57:46.285
More water?

57:48.006 --> 57:50.749
Thank you for your invitation,
Miss Dickinson.

57:52.344 --> 57:58.261
I was very moved by your sermon, sir,
and wanted very much to tell you.

58:07.192 --> 58:11.607
This is all I have to give in return.

59:16.386 --> 59:19.162
Please say something.

59:19.222 --> 59:21.839
Does my poetry have any worth?

59:25.812 --> 59:28.130
They are remarkable.

59:28.190 --> 59:32.605
Uncompromising, yes,
but this is wonderful poetry.

59:33.945 --> 59:36.054
How many have been published?

59:36.114 --> 59:38.432
Seven.

59:38.492 --> 59:40.233
Eleven?

59:41.328 --> 59:43.020
I cannot recall.

59:43.080 --> 59:46.565
- And no more?
- And no more.

59:46.625 --> 59:48.608
How can you be so stoic?

59:48.668 --> 59:52.082
It's easy to be stoic when no one
wants what you have to offer.

59:54.216 --> 59:57.084
There is, I suppose, always posterity.

59:58.637 --> 01:00:01.175
But posterity is as comfortless as God.

01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:04.041
That sounds like despair.

01:00:04.101 --> 01:00:06.138
No, it's bitterness.

01:00:07.646 --> 01:00:09.087
Besides...

01:00:09.147 --> 01:00:12.299
a posthumous reputation
is only for those who, when living,

01:00:12.359 --> 01:00:14.316
weren't worth remembering.

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:17.858
Still... Ah!

01:00:19.533 --> 01:00:21.695
To be racked by success!

01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:29.078
But I would like some approval before I die.

01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:36.698
EMILY: If you were coming in the fall,
I'd brush the summer by

01:00:36.758 --> 01:00:41.173
With half a smile and half a spurn,
As housewives do a fly.

01:00:42.097 --> 01:00:47.042
If I could see you in a year,
I'd wind the months in balls,

01:00:47.102 --> 01:00:51.472
And put them each in separate drawers,
Until their time befalls.

01:00:52.232 --> 01:00:57.177
If only centuries delayed,
I'd count them on my hand,

01:00:57.237 --> 01:01:02.224
Subtracting till my fingers dropped
Into Van Diemen's land.

01:01:02.284 --> 01:01:08.326
If certain, when this life was out,
That yours and mine should be,

01:01:09.541 --> 01:01:14.912
I'd toss it yonder like a rind,
And taste eternity.

01:01:17.048 --> 01:01:23.591
But now, all ignorant of the length
Of time's uncertain wing,

01:01:25.265 --> 01:01:31.353
It goads me, like the goblin bee,
That will not state its sting.

01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:37.259
I must have someone with a sense of humour,

01:01:37.319 --> 01:01:39.761
someone who can laugh at the world.

01:01:39.821 --> 01:01:43.890
Taking life seriously
is the shortest route to disaster.

01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:46.017
And have you found such a one?

01:01:46.077 --> 01:01:48.478
Someone has found me.

01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:52.149
A Mr Wilder, a Professor of Mathematics.

01:01:52.209 --> 01:01:56.670
And if he can find comedy
in a vulgar fraction, I'm his.

01:01:57.797 --> 01:02:01.783
- But do you love him?
- Love? I cannot say.

01:02:01.843 --> 01:02:05.962
It's a very beguiling idea.
They even say it exists.

01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:09.507
But how will you know?

01:02:12.771 --> 01:02:15.088
What if you make an error?

01:02:15.148 --> 01:02:18.425
If he is a bad choice,
I'll have him killed quietly

01:02:18.485 --> 01:02:22.775
and tell everyone he died of some sort
of algebraic shock. (CHUCKLES)

01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:26.016
I hope you will be happy.

01:02:26.076 --> 01:02:31.104
That cannot be guaranteed.
I'll settle for consideration.

01:02:31.164 --> 01:02:35.233
- That sounds like surrender.
- No, it's practicality.

01:02:35.293 --> 01:02:39.654
And who knows?
Perhaps love will come in its wake.

01:02:39.714 --> 01:02:44.201
- Then I can relax into smugness.
- You could never be smug.

01:02:44.261 --> 01:02:49.414
Life catches you out, Emily. In the end,
we all become the thing we most dread.

01:02:49.474 --> 01:02:53.293
Then I will reject the world
and not fulfil that prophecy.

01:02:53.353 --> 01:02:56.213
Then you will be making
the greatest of mistakes,

01:02:56.273 --> 01:02:59.812
for you will deny yourself
what your spirit needs most.

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:05.347
- And what is that?
- Truth. And experience.

01:03:05.407 --> 01:03:08.099
Otherwise,
your vow will be an act of cowardice.

01:03:08.159 --> 01:03:11.778
- That was hurtful.
- But honest.

01:03:12.914 --> 01:03:18.026
Don't resist your vices, Emily.
It is your virtues you should be wary of.

01:03:18.086 --> 01:03:22.781
Austin once told Aunt Elizabeth
that our virtues are just vices in disguise.

01:03:22.841 --> 01:03:24.824
Now, there is a man with a sense of humour.

01:03:24.884 --> 01:03:27.251
And does your Mr Wilder possess one?

01:03:28.179 --> 01:03:31.081
Of a kind. He proposed to me by letter,

01:03:31.141 --> 01:03:34.976
so if the marriage is unhappy,
I shall blame the US mail.

01:03:36.479 --> 01:03:38.505
Always conform.

01:03:38.565 --> 01:03:41.633
Keep disobedience secret.

01:03:41.693 --> 01:03:46.805
Be outwardly docile, but in your heart,
you can be as revolutionary as you like.

01:03:46.865 --> 01:03:49.683
- But isn't that hypocrisy?
- Of course it is.

01:03:49.743 --> 01:03:52.227
But in America, we cherish it.

01:03:52.287 --> 01:03:54.854
We think it makes us incorruptible.

01:03:54.914 --> 01:03:58.858
You must never confuse
the outer with the inner piety.

01:03:58.918 --> 01:04:01.486
Only Episcopalians do that.

01:04:01.546 --> 01:04:06.408
But I am rebellious
and far from the grace of God.

01:04:06.468 --> 01:04:08.835
You are closer to Him than anyone I know.

01:04:11.306 --> 01:04:16.126
Always look below the surface, Emily,
but don't be afraid of what you find there.

01:04:16.186 --> 01:04:18.894
- Chaos?
- Yes.

01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:25.719
Then I shall confront everything.

01:04:25.779 --> 01:04:29.639
Don't be too radical, Emily.
Radicals don't thrive in this country.

01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:33.351
- But you are a radical.
- But I'll eventually conform.

01:04:33.411 --> 01:04:36.324
For the sake of peace or a quiet life.

01:04:38.458 --> 01:04:41.917
But I know that you will not,
and I envy you your courage.

01:04:46.966 --> 01:04:49.709
I suppose you shall carry lovely flowers

01:04:51.096 --> 01:04:53.258
and have Mr Mendelssohn's "Wedding March".

01:04:53.932 --> 01:04:58.168
Flowers, yes. Mendelssohn, no.

01:04:58.228 --> 01:05:02.130
Never play happy music at a wedding,
Emily, it's too misleading.

01:05:02.190 --> 01:05:06.259
- But you shall be forever gone from us.
- You make it sound like dying.

01:05:06.319 --> 01:05:08.511
- Isn't it?
- No.

01:05:08.571 --> 01:05:12.110
And even if it were, you must
force yourself to think otherwise.

01:05:13.118 --> 01:05:15.143
America is the only country in the world

01:05:15.203 --> 01:05:18.116
that looks upon death
as some kind of personal failure.

01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:27.864
May I get you something, Mother?

01:05:27.924 --> 01:05:29.961
No, Emily. (SIGHS)

01:05:33.346 --> 01:05:36.089
You've always seemed so sad, Mother.

01:05:39.811 --> 01:05:42.428
My life has passed as if in a dream.

01:05:45.066 --> 01:05:47.558
As if I'd never been part of it.

01:05:51.698 --> 01:05:54.140
After Vinnie was born,

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:59.912
a kind of melancholia settled over me
which I mistook for contentment.

01:06:02.542 --> 01:06:05.080
Were we such a terrible price to pay?

01:06:06.671 --> 01:06:08.537
No!

01:06:09.841 --> 01:06:12.254
I wouldn't be without all three of you.

01:06:14.679 --> 01:06:16.716
To have my children about me...

01:06:17.932 --> 01:06:20.208
there could be no better medicine.

Reverend Wadsworth
has sailed for San Francisco.

01:07:36.636 --> 01:07:39.504
They all go. They all leave.

01:07:40.598 --> 01:07:41.915
They all desert you.

01:07:41.975 --> 01:07:44.467
Do not touch me!

01:07:45.478 --> 01:07:49.255
I will not be pitied.
It makes me feel repulsive.

01:07:49.315 --> 01:07:51.841
You set too much store
by physical beauty, Emily.

01:07:51.901 --> 01:07:56.095
The only people who can be sanguine
about not being handsome

01:07:56.155 --> 01:07:58.442
are those who are beautiful already.

01:07:59.367 --> 01:08:02.143
The rest of us have only our envy
to keep us warm.

01:08:02.203 --> 01:08:06.105
- You have an exquisite nature.
- What's the use of that in this world?

01:08:06.165 --> 01:08:08.983
I sometimes think
you are too harsh with yourself.

01:08:09.043 --> 01:08:12.695
I have many defects.
There is much to rectify!

01:08:12.755 --> 01:08:15.156
It is just as punitive
to admit to too many faults

01:08:15.216 --> 01:08:17.617
as it is to deny too few virtues.

01:08:17.676 --> 01:08:20.215
The Reverend Wadsworth is a married man.

01:08:24.892 --> 01:08:27.054
This kind of attachment is improper.

01:08:29.397 --> 01:08:32.506
We can't all possess your smug rectitude.

01:08:32.567 --> 01:08:33.925
Don't sneer at anyone's morals

01:08:33.984 --> 01:08:35.969
when your own could do with
some little correction.

01:08:36.029 --> 01:08:38.429
By that, I assume
you mean Reverend Wadsworth?

01:08:38.488 --> 01:08:40.265
He's married!

01:08:40.325 --> 01:08:41.765
You should not attach yourself

01:08:41.826 --> 01:08:45.144
to someone who is not free
to return that attachment!

01:08:45.203 --> 01:08:48.162
You hardly know the man,
except through his sermons.

Besides, he and Mrs Wadsworth are very happy.

01:08:54.671 --> 01:08:56.197
She has led a blameless life.

01:08:56.256 --> 01:09:00.868
She hasn't led a life at all!
She's too inert for that.

01:09:00.928 --> 01:09:04.788
If docility were love,
we would all live happily ever after.

01:09:04.849 --> 01:09:07.542
She's a good wife!

01:09:07.602 --> 01:09:11.712
And, to be truthful, I have never understood
the attraction of her husband for you.

01:09:11.773 --> 01:09:15.858
He is hardly a Mr Rochester,
and you are certainly not Jane Eyre!

01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:24.657
That was unkind.

01:09:26.746 --> 01:09:29.314
I'm sorry, too.

Emily?

01:14:16.786 --> 01:14:18.823
You must eat.

01:14:19.914 --> 01:14:22.122
You must come down now.

01:14:24.961 --> 01:14:26.953
It's been three days.

01:14:33.344 --> 01:14:35.336
You are wearing white.

01:14:36.931 --> 01:14:38.998
Yes.

01:14:39.058 --> 01:14:41.971
But we're still in mourning.

01:14:43.938 --> 01:14:45.930
So am I.

01:14:49.610 --> 01:14:53.554
Emily? It's Mr Bowles.

01:14:53.614 --> 01:14:56.527
He's come to Amherst specially to see you.

01:15:06.168 --> 01:15:08.444
Well, come down, damn you.

01:15:08.504 --> 01:15:11.588
I refuse to speak to someone
who's a flight of stairs above me.

01:15:12.591 --> 01:15:15.326
Forgive me, sir, if I'm frightened.

01:15:15.386 --> 01:15:18.204
I never see anyone
and I hardly know what to say.

01:15:18.264 --> 01:15:22.083
You could say thank you
for my publishing some of your verse.

01:15:22.143 --> 01:15:25.836
For that, sir, you have more than
my thanks. You have my gratitude.

01:15:25.896 --> 01:15:28.138
But, sir...

01:15:29.734 --> 01:15:32.510
you have altered some of my punctuation.

01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:36.639
Good Lord. What's a hyphen here
or a semi-colon there?

01:15:36.699 --> 01:15:38.683
To many, nothing.

01:15:38.743 --> 01:15:43.187
But, to me, the alteration of my
punctuation marks is very hard to endure.

01:15:43.247 --> 01:15:45.940
Then I apologise.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.568
I was merely trying to make
your meaning clearer to my readers.

01:15:49.628 --> 01:15:53.713
Clarity is one thing, sir,
obviousness quite another.

01:15:54.842 --> 01:15:59.745
The only person qualified to interfere
with the poet's work is the poet herself.

01:15:59.805 --> 01:16:02.123
From anyone else, it feels like an attack.

01:16:02.183 --> 01:16:06.293
Miss Dickinson,
this is no way to speak or behave.

01:16:06.353 --> 01:16:10.563
If you treated a suitor like this,
he would not return.

01:16:12.276 --> 01:16:15.269
- Are you sure there will be one?
- Of course.

01:16:16.113 --> 01:16:18.901
Even for someone
as hard to please as yourself.

01:16:20.409 --> 01:16:22.560
Well, if he does come,

01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:27.231
he will have to be as spectacular
as Disraeli and as sincere as Gladstone.

01:16:27.291 --> 01:16:29.624
And as upright as George Washington?

01:16:31.670 --> 01:16:34.413

Our beautiful friend?

01:17:27.518 --> 01:17:30.010
- Will you come down?
- No.

01:17:31.564 --> 01:17:34.215
This is discourteous.
Why will you not come down and meet him?

01:17:34.275 --> 01:17:38.177
Because he is so beautiful,
and I am not beautiful enough.

01:17:38.237 --> 01:17:41.347
He's read some of your published poems
and admires them.

01:17:41.407 --> 01:17:43.808
Admiration always masks envy.

01:17:43.868 --> 01:17:45.768
What does envy mask?

01:17:45.828 --> 01:17:48.696
Oh, that masks admiration.

01:17:50.541 --> 01:17:52.783
He may come to the foot of the stairs.

01:17:53.878 --> 01:17:56.586
- Miss Dickinson?
- EMILY: Yes.

01:17:57.715 --> 01:18:01.425
- I cannot see you.
- That, sir, is no matter.

01:18:03.179 --> 01:18:07.264
(CHUCKLES) It is the first time
I've conducted a visit in this fashion.

01:18:09.351 --> 01:18:13.587
It seems unfair that you can see me
but I can only hear you.

01:18:13.647 --> 01:18:18.312
That can be no hardship, sir,
for I am best heard and not seen.

01:18:20.237 --> 01:18:22.304
Er... Will you take a ride
with Vinnie and me?

01:18:22.364 --> 01:18:26.684
I do not cross my father's ground
to any house or town.

01:18:26.744 --> 01:18:29.687
That seems such a shame,
especially in such lovely weather.

01:18:29.747 --> 01:18:33.866
The weather will remain lovely
whether I drive through it or not.

01:18:37.171 --> 01:18:38.958
Then I wish you good day, Miss Dickinson.

01:18:39.215 --> 01:18:40.922
Good day, Mr Emmons.

01:18:44.386 --> 01:18:48.471

01:19:02.529 --> 01:19:06.648
But I will wait all my days

01:19:09.245 --> 01:19:12.909

# My heart had never known you

# Shall we begin to wrangle?

# No, no, no, my heart is fast

01:20:15.185 --> 01:20:24.231
# And cannot disentangle

# And take my life and spare not #

01:23:16.366 --> 01:23:19.726
Oh, Emily, you should have come -
it was radiant.

01:23:19.786 --> 01:23:22.688
Yes. And I'm sure you would have
made it even more radiant, Miss Emily.

01:23:22.748 --> 01:23:27.151
Ridicule is not the way to
any woman's heart, sir. Least of all mine.

01:23:27.211 --> 01:23:28.861
MR EMMONS: It was meant sincerely.

01:23:28.921 --> 01:23:31.405
Or should I judge beauty
by the common standard?

01:23:31.465 --> 01:23:36.827
Any standard may be common.
Familiarity, as they say, breeds contempt.

01:23:36.887 --> 01:23:39.663
Perhaps contempt breeds familiarity.

01:23:39.723 --> 01:23:42.458
At any rate,
beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

01:23:42.518 --> 01:23:47.764
That is no longer true, sir.
For that truism has become a cliché.

01:23:50.651 --> 01:23:52.759
Miss Dickinson,
you are just a little too sharp.

01:23:52.819 --> 01:23:55.888
And you, sir, are a little too quick
to play the martyr.

01:23:55.948 --> 01:23:58.531
Then I'll take my leave
before any blood is spilt.

01:23:59.493 --> 01:24:02.201
There are wounds which do not bleed,

01:24:05.290 --> 01:24:07.907
but which aggrieve nonetheless.

01:24:09.127 --> 01:24:13.588
I just assumed that you wanted
to be rid of me. I meant no injury.

01:24:14.508 --> 01:24:18.878
Nor did I, sir. I only wish to be honest.

01:24:24.309 --> 01:24:25.876
May I call again?

01:24:25.936 --> 01:24:29.755
If it gives you no pleasure,
what is the point?

01:24:29.815 --> 01:24:32.424
I had hoped that my company
wouldn't be a burden.

01:24:32.484 --> 01:24:35.602
A burden can always be laid down, sir.

01:24:36.655 --> 01:24:39.238
You are not required to be another Sisyphus.

01:24:47.249 --> 01:24:48.899
(DOOR CLOSES)

01:24:48.959 --> 01:24:52.418
Oh, Emily, why do you behave like this?

01:24:53.839 --> 01:24:57.241
He is a kind man and he was hurt.

01:24:57.301 --> 01:24:59.418
I don't know.

01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:03.838
As soon as they get too close,
I feel as if I'm suffocating.

01:25:04.933 --> 01:25:08.802
I long for... something.

01:25:10.814 --> 01:25:13.423
But I am afraid of it.

01:25:13.483 --> 01:25:18.178
A man may love and then cool,
but it is not that way with me.

01:25:18.238 --> 01:25:20.514
But you cannot be equal to a man.

01:25:20.574 --> 01:25:23.692
If I cannot have equality,
then I want nothing of love.

01:25:24.703 --> 01:25:27.312
I will not be so confined
that I cannot breathe.

01:25:27.372 --> 01:25:31.149
But a rebellious spirit
invites only retribution.

01:25:31.209 --> 01:25:34.236
Then I will be silent in my rebellion,

01:25:34.296 --> 01:25:36.780
so that no one will know
what my true feelings are.

01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:40.951
- God will know.
- But I will not be married to God.

01:25:41.011 --> 01:25:44.129
But you are His possession
and answerable to Him.

01:25:46.516 --> 01:25:49.304
He will know of my struggle and be merciful.

01:25:51.938 --> 01:25:53.975
And if He does not exist,

01:25:55.651 --> 01:25:57.608
then I will be eternally free.

How is Susan?

01:42:22.928 --> 01:42:27.456
Well, thank you. She's taking tea with Mabel.

01:42:27.516 --> 01:42:31.544
Ah, Mrs Todd. And her dull narcissism.

01:42:31.604 --> 01:42:36.007
You mistake confidence for narcissism,
and womanly reticence for dullness.

01:42:36.067 --> 01:42:38.259
Whatever else can be said of Mrs Todd,

01:42:38.319 --> 01:42:40.970
no one could ever accuse her of reticence.

01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:43.431
Or does one only require reticence in a wife?

01:42:43.491 --> 01:42:46.700
- My wife is perfectly happy.
- Yes, of course.

01:42:47.745 --> 01:42:51.314
I'm sure she sees infidelity,
when accompanied by Schubert,

01:42:51.374 --> 01:42:53.316
as a delightful pastime.

01:42:53.376 --> 01:42:54.984
A kind of musical adultery.

01:42:55.044 --> 01:42:57.862
Real artists cannot be confined
by narrow convention.

01:42:57.922 --> 01:43:01.824
Real artists don't deceive themselves
or their public.

When you have any public to speak of,

01:43:03.636 --> 01:43:06.787
I'm sure your reputation
will no doubt be very secure.

01:43:06.847 --> 01:43:09.790
In all this, Susan is the innocent party.

01:43:09.850 --> 01:43:11.334
If you take the trouble to look,

01:43:11.394 --> 01:43:13.753
you'd see there is more to that innocence
than meets the eye.

01:43:13.813 --> 01:43:16.130
That is a despicable thing to say!

01:43:16.190 --> 01:43:18.147
Oh, stop bickering!

01:43:26.659 --> 01:43:28.901
My sympathies are entirely with Susan.

01:43:30.287 --> 01:43:34.523
If she had a liaison with a married man,
how would you respond?

01:43:34.583 --> 01:43:37.068
I would not forgive her.

01:43:37.128 --> 01:43:39.403
Yet you "admire" Mrs Todd.

01:43:39.463 --> 01:43:43.741
An admirable woman is one thing,
a wife quite another.

01:43:43.801 --> 01:43:47.119
I don't think I've ever been this close
to despising you.

01:43:47.179 --> 01:43:52.500
- Don't lecture me on how to live!
- And don't try to justify your position!

01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:54.847
It is both immoral and vicious.

01:43:55.896 --> 01:43:59.890
Susan is a good and intelligent wife.

01:44:00.985 --> 01:44:03.803
Or do you prefer more obvious charms?

01:44:03.863 --> 01:44:06.222
By that I assume you mean Mabel Loomis Todd?

01:44:06.282 --> 01:44:11.602
Mrs Todd, yes. And don't tell me your
intentions toward her are merely fraternal!

01:44:11.662 --> 01:44:13.938
Especially in that semi-recumbent position!

01:44:13.998 --> 01:44:17.983

you are as ugly as your poetry!

Mabel's made up her mind
to continue the status quo.

01:44:34.226 --> 01:44:38.641
She is incapable of making up her mind
because she is too stupid to have one!

01:44:39.774 --> 01:44:41.731

You lash out because you are hurt or angry.

a defence against the world.

Mrs Todd may have her private troubles,

Susan in the vilest way imaginable!

You judge too harshly
because you judge too highly.

Lowering a standard
is the first excuse for every villainy.

and now it seems an encumbrance
to be easily put aside!

01:49:40.657 --> 01:49:44.268
Integrity, if taken too far,
can be equally ruthless.

01:56:16.678 --> 01:56:20.843
If Immortality unveil a third event to me,

01:56:22.225 --> 01:56:27.437
So huge, so hopeless to conceive,
As these that twice befell.

01:56:30.275 --> 01:56:34.610
Parting is all we know of Heaven,
And all we need of Hell.

01:56:36.323 --> 01:56:41.159
Goodbye to the life I used to live,
And the world I used to know;

01:56:42.579 --> 01:56:45.162
And kiss the hills for me, just once;

01:56:46.958 --> 01:56:49.917
Now I am ready to go!

01:56:57.844 --> 01:57:01.133
Because I could not stop for Death -

01:57:02.557 --> 01:57:04.970
He kindly stopped for me -

01:57:06.102 --> 01:57:08.970
The carriage held but just ourselves -

01:57:10.106 --> 01:57:12.143
And Immortality.

01:57:13.401 --> 01:57:16.769
We slowly drove - he knew no haste

01:57:17.822 --> 01:57:22.809
And I had put away
My labour and my leisure too,

01:57:22.869 --> 01:57:24.781
For His civility.

01:57:25.914 --> 01:57:29.024
We passed the school, where children strove,

01:57:29.084 --> 01:57:30.996
At recess - in the ring -

01:57:32.170 --> 01:57:35.208
We passed the fields of grazing grain -

01:57:36.550 --> 01:57:38.917
We passed the setting sun -

01:57:40.262 --> 01:57:44.051
Or rather - he passed us -

01:57:46.393 --> 01:57:49.586
The dews drew quivering and chill -

01:57:49.646 --> 01:57:55.358
For only gossamer, my gown -
My tippet - only tulle -

01:57:57.696 --> 01:58:02.682
We paused before a house that seemed
A swelling of the ground -

01:58:02.742 --> 01:58:07.612
The roof was scarcely visible -
The cornice - in the ground -

01:58:09.666 --> 01:58:17.915
Since then - 'tis centuries - and yet
Feels shorter than the day

01:58:18.925 --> 01:58:25.297
I first surmised the horses' heads
Were toward eternity -

01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:37.300
This is my letter to the world,
That never wrote to me, -

01:58:37.360 --> 01:58:41.570
The simple news that Nature told,
With tender majesty.

01:58:42.741 --> 01:58:47.953
Her message is committed
To hands I cannot see;

01:58:49.581 --> 01:58:55.919
For love of her, sweet countrymen,
Judge tenderly of me!

01:58:56.305 --> 01:59:02.747
