00:10.010 --> 00:13.096
Follow yourselfTo the top of a mountain

00:13.180 --> 00:15.682
Answer the callYeah, be the believer

00:15.766 --> 00:18.852
Throw your fears like a wishInto a fountain

00:19.436 --> 00:22.898
Like a warrior

00:22.981 --> 00:25.192
Whatever you might beWhoever you are

00:25.275 --> 00:28.946
You're a warrior

00:31.156 --> 00:33.450
"What Would Freda Do?"

00:39.540 --> 00:41.083
Whoops. Pinecone down.

00:41.166 --> 00:45.212
What inspired thisâ€¦early morning attic adventure?

00:47.589 --> 00:49.383
You know how tomorrow is Freda Day?

00:49.466 --> 00:53.595
Well, the Lil Rumblers and Wiz Kids getto put on presentations at the festival

00:53.679 --> 00:56.849
to honor our town founder.And since she used to live in this castle,

00:56.932 --> 00:59.309
I thought I might find someof her old stuff up here.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.562
Like her famous golden gauntlet. Like her famous golden gauntlet.

01:01.645 --> 01:05.649
The one she used to create Sturdystonewith her fist of fierceness.

01:05.732 --> 01:10.445
It's all here on my limited editionFreda the Fierce Heroic Hero trading card.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.491
You think she's gonnatell us the legend again?

01:14.575 --> 01:15.492
Definitely.

01:15.576 --> 01:18.912
Before the founding of Sturdystone,

01:18.996 --> 01:21.623
no one could agree on whereto live or how to get along.

01:21.707 --> 01:25.377
I'm a warrior. I wanna rumble.

01:25.460 --> 01:29.756
I'm a wizard. I do wizard stuff.

01:29.840 --> 01:34.344
Then Freda shouted,"Enough! You must all stop fighting

01:34.428 --> 01:37.806
and listen to my ideafor a town right now."

01:37.890 --> 01:42.352
Freda raised her fist of fierceness,and bam!

01:42.436 --> 01:47.399
With one epic punch, the whole townof Sturdystone shot up around her.

01:47.482 --> 01:51.153
And everyone was so in aweof her fierceness

01:51.236 --> 01:54.239
that they agreed to live therewith her as their leader.

01:54.323 --> 01:58.285
Freda united all of Sturdystonewith her strong vision

01:58.368 --> 02:00.871
and her even stronger fist. and her even stronger fist.

02:00.954 --> 02:03.665
I wanna unite the Lil Rumblersand Wiz Kids like that.

02:03.749 --> 02:06.752
I'm sure you will.You're the biggest Freda fan I know.

02:06.835 --> 02:07.961
Thanks.

02:08.044 --> 02:10.964
I just wish I could find her gauntlet.

02:11.048 --> 02:13.926
All I found was this weird ruler,some blueprints,

02:14.009 --> 02:16.136
and a bunch of old math thingies.

02:17.304 --> 02:19.181
At least I found this kazoo,

02:19.264 --> 02:22.309
which will really come in handyfor my presentation idea.

02:26.939 --> 02:28.315
I'd better go.

02:28.398 --> 02:31.944
Got to lead everyoneto presentation glory.

02:32.528 --> 02:34.112
Do you guys have any ideas?

02:34.196 --> 02:36.615
-It's gotta be fierce.-My newt's fierce.

02:39.409 --> 02:40.410
Hello.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.704
Greymoon and I are thrilled

02:42.788 --> 02:48.335
that the Lil Rumblers and Wiz Kids arecoming together for this year's showcase.

02:48.418 --> 02:50.587
It is a huge honor.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.840
And huge fun.

02:52.923 --> 02:55.300
Gladys and I are goingto be emceeing the event.

02:55.384 --> 02:56.677
So, we're relying on you

02:56.760 --> 02:58.971
to rehearse your presentationson your own.

02:59.054 --> 03:01.598
Wait. Since when are we emceeing? Wait. Since when are we emceeing?

03:02.307 --> 03:03.350
I signed us up.

03:06.270 --> 03:07.563
Moving right along.

03:07.646 --> 03:09.314
Who's got ideas?

03:10.774 --> 03:14.403
As you all know, I'm kind ofthe Freda expert of the group.

03:15.237 --> 03:17.281
-Wow.-Oh, yeah.

03:18.574 --> 03:22.286
And I happen to knowthat Freda was a major music lover.

03:22.369 --> 03:27.040
Which is why I have written a songabout Freda so fierce,

03:27.124 --> 03:31.587
it'll bring the whole town to its knees!

03:31.670 --> 03:33.046
In a good way.

03:33.130 --> 03:35.048
-I like it.-My newt's on board.

03:35.132 --> 03:36.133
I'd do that.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.759
Then it is settled.

03:37.843 --> 03:40.762
The rest of you shallperform Pinecone's song.

03:40.846 --> 03:43.390
Which means, Pinecone,you will be the leader.

03:43.473 --> 03:47.644
But remember,this is a group presentation.

03:51.190 --> 03:53.817
Back in the dayThings were kinda rough

03:53.901 --> 03:56.486
Everyone just fought'Cause they were so tough

03:56.570 --> 03:59.239
That's when Freda arrivedAnd she said, "Enough"

03:59.323 --> 04:02.117
Instead of punching peopleFreda punched the ground Instead of punching peopleFreda punched the ground

04:02.201 --> 04:04.786
And Sturdystone popped up all around

04:04.870 --> 04:07.748
Oh, FredaFreda was the fiercest leader

04:07.831 --> 04:10.584
Freda, Freda, you can't beat her

04:13.420 --> 04:15.631
I have goose bumps.

04:15.714 --> 04:18.341
It sounds almost too good.

04:19.510 --> 04:20.511
Pinecone?

04:20.594 --> 04:22.095
It's a great start,

04:22.179 --> 04:26.308
but I think it coulduse a little more pizzazz.

04:26.892 --> 04:29.394
-Pizzazz?-I think I should do a solo.

04:29.478 --> 04:32.231
You know,I am the most musical of the group.

04:32.314 --> 04:34.816
And maybe if the song rhymed

04:34.900 --> 04:37.569
more than it does already.

04:37.653 --> 04:40.072
I've been workingon my rhyming poetry and--

04:40.155 --> 04:43.700
I think a little jazz flute could addsome panache to that pizzazz.

04:43.784 --> 04:48.121
And since Freda loved music,she must have loved dance as well.

04:48.205 --> 04:51.250
No. Thanks for the suggestions, but I--

04:51.333 --> 04:53.794
And I could sing a verse about my newt.

04:53.877 --> 04:55.212
His name is Zoot.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.339
I can write rhymesabout our animal friends.

04:57.422 --> 04:58.841
You could be my backup singers.

04:58.924 --> 05:02.135
Ballet is like a songthat your body sings in silence. Ballet is like a songthat your body sings in silence.

05:04.137 --> 05:07.099
You're right, Pony.I've gotta be fierce like Freda.

05:07.182 --> 05:09.601
Enough!

05:11.436 --> 05:14.273
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

05:14.356 --> 05:16.275
Are you okay, Pinecone?

05:16.358 --> 05:18.360
Why did you do that?

05:18.443 --> 05:20.654
Because none of you were listening.

05:20.737 --> 05:22.948
And it's what Freda would do.

05:23.574 --> 05:24.700
Hurt her hand?

05:24.783 --> 05:25.951
No.

05:26.034 --> 05:28.078
Take charge by being fierce.

05:28.161 --> 05:33.959
I'm the leader. This is my idea,so you should do it how I wrote it.

05:34.042 --> 05:35.878
Hit it, Pony.

05:35.961 --> 05:39.381
Freda, Freda was the fiercest leader

05:39.464 --> 05:42.134
Freda, Freda!

05:44.094 --> 05:45.095
Yeah.

05:45.179 --> 05:48.473
So, they leftto go do their own presentations.

05:49.641 --> 05:52.895
Freda's fiercenessbrought everyone together,

05:52.978 --> 05:54.855
so where'd I go wrong?

05:55.772 --> 05:58.859
Listen, I know you love Freda,

05:58.942 --> 06:03.322
but maybe there's more to herthan what's written on that card. but maybe there's more to herthan what's written on that card.

06:03.405 --> 06:06.617
Hawthorn. It's a limited edition.

06:07.201 --> 06:08.619
I know, I know.

06:08.702 --> 06:11.330
But she founded a whole town.

06:11.413 --> 06:15.167
She must have been morethan a yelly voice and a fierce fist.

06:15.250 --> 06:17.461
Just think about it.

06:19.505 --> 06:20.547
Wait.

06:21.507 --> 06:23.967
I always thought that was a staff,

06:24.051 --> 06:27.095
but that's no staff.

06:27.179 --> 06:29.848
It's that weird ruler from this morning.

06:29.932 --> 06:32.518
But I don't get how itcould have made her fierce.

06:32.601 --> 06:34.728
Just really goodat drawing straight lines.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.442
Maybe this does something.

06:47.533 --> 06:50.285
Careful, kid. This ruler is an antique.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.832
You're the ghost of Freda the Fierce?

06:55.916 --> 06:57.960
-Yep.-And you live in my attic?

06:59.545 --> 07:03.340
-Yep.-I have so many questions for you. -Yep.-I have so many questions for you.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.551
Like, how did you makeeveryone listen to you?

07:05.634 --> 07:07.261
What's your favorite taco topping?

07:07.344 --> 07:09.721
How did you build buildingsby punching the ground?

07:10.639 --> 07:14.726
Okay, first,I didn't make anyone do anything.

07:14.810 --> 07:17.938
Second, chopped peanuts.Don't knock it till you've tried it.

07:18.021 --> 07:22.860
And third, did you just say,"Build buildings by punching the ground"?

07:26.196 --> 07:27.739
What's this glove thingy?

07:27.823 --> 07:30.701
Your golden gauntlet, of course.

07:31.326 --> 07:32.828
My what?

07:32.911 --> 07:36.498
Wow, they really took some libertieswith my story, huh?

07:37.332 --> 07:40.878
I guess it must've been easier to make itseem like I did everything myself.

07:42.880 --> 07:43.881
Didn't you?

07:43.964 --> 07:45.257
No.

07:45.340 --> 07:48.760
It takes a villageand a lot of good subcontractors

07:48.844 --> 07:50.637
to make a whole town.

07:50.721 --> 07:53.140
When it cameto the founding of Sturdystone,

07:53.223 --> 07:55.767
everyone had a lot of great ideas.

07:56.727 --> 07:58.312
We should build an arena.

07:58.395 --> 07:59.730
And a castle.

07:59.813 --> 08:03.358
I knew if such a diverse groupwere gonna live in harmony, I knew if such a diverse groupwere gonna live in harmony,

08:03.442 --> 08:05.944
we needed to createa kingdom like no other.

08:06.028 --> 08:11.158
Then you used your fist of fiercenessto punch the ground and--

08:11.241 --> 08:13.702
Again with the punching? No.

08:13.785 --> 08:18.540
I came up with a vision for Sturdystonethat incorporated everyone's ideas.

08:18.624 --> 08:21.293
And together,we were able to found the fiercest,

08:21.376 --> 08:24.922
most far-out kingdomthe realm has ever seen.

08:25.005 --> 08:28.300
But why does everyone talkabout your fist of fierceness?

08:28.383 --> 08:32.261
How do you thinkI celebrated our success, huh?

08:32.346 --> 08:35.724
Freda! Say it with me.Come on. You can say it.

08:35.807 --> 08:37.183
Freda.

08:37.267 --> 08:42.356
So your vision for the town wasto incorporate everyone's vision?

08:42.438 --> 08:43.815
Exactly.

08:43.899 --> 08:47.444
That's what made Sturdystonesuch a cool place.

08:47.528 --> 08:49.738
That and my trusty slide ruler.

08:49.821 --> 08:52.157
An engineer's best friend.

08:56.912 --> 08:58.705
Do you think I could borrow this?

08:58.789 --> 09:00.082
It's yours, kid. It's yours, kid.

09:00.165 --> 09:02.376
Chat me up again sometime. And, hey,

09:02.459 --> 09:04.086
stay on the level.

09:08.131 --> 09:10.759
Pony, we needto get everyone back together.

09:10.843 --> 09:12.511
I have an idea.

09:13.387 --> 09:15.264
What a performance.

09:15.347 --> 09:19.685
It might be Freda Day,but we'll be talking about that every day.

09:19.768 --> 09:21.770
Am I right, Gladys?

09:21.854 --> 09:24.356
-No banter.-Fine.

09:24.439 --> 09:27.276
Next up, we'll have the otherLil Rumblers and Wiz Kids,

09:27.359 --> 09:32.573
who will be performing a songabout Freda by our very own Pinecone.

09:35.868 --> 09:38.662
My fellow Sturdystonians,

09:38.745 --> 09:42.749
I regret to inform you that dueto creative differences,

09:42.833 --> 09:45.752
we will notbe performing the song I wrote.

09:46.587 --> 09:48.046
Turns out, being fierce

09:48.130 --> 09:50.716
doesn't mean making others dowhat you want them to do.

09:50.799 --> 09:53.010
A good leader makes sureeveryone is heard.

09:53.093 --> 09:59.016
Which is why I am proudto present a piece written by all of us

09:59.099 --> 10:02.311
that tells the real storyof Freda the Fierce that tells the real storyof Freda the Fierce

10:02.394 --> 10:04.855
the way she would've done it.

10:04.938 --> 10:05.939
Hit it!

10:08.108 --> 10:12.905
A Sturdystone for everyoneBut how'd it come to be

10:12.988 --> 10:18.410
A magical place which prides itselfOn perfect harmony?

10:18.493 --> 10:21.079
Hawthorn, drop some rhyming poetry

10:21.163 --> 10:23.123
Back in the day, folks roamed around

10:23.207 --> 10:25.751
They had different ideasThey needed a town

10:25.834 --> 10:28.128
But one voice emergedFrom out of the fray

10:28.212 --> 10:30.631
A lone hero that had something to say

10:30.714 --> 10:33.091
I'm Freda the FierceI've been listening to you

10:33.175 --> 10:35.594
Let's combine all your ideasInto something new

10:35.677 --> 10:37.971
A training yard where we can get tough

10:38.055 --> 10:40.390
A wizarding classFor learning cool stuff

10:40.474 --> 10:42.851
A big huge arena where we can all win

10:42.935 --> 10:45.270
Let me do the mathWe can fit it all in

10:45.354 --> 10:50.192
A Sturdystone for everyoneYour voice is important

10:50.275 --> 10:55.030
From everyday ideasTo the most eccentric notion

10:55.113 --> 11:00.160
My newt, he's so cuteWatch him dance to this flute My newt, he's so cuteWatch him dance to this flute

11:00.244 --> 11:04.915
A Sturdystone for everyoneWe celebrate each year

11:04.998 --> 11:08.377
Now punch your fist into the air

11:08.460 --> 11:10.504
Not the ground. Trust me.

11:10.587 --> 11:12.589
And give a big Freda cheer

11:12.673 --> 11:13.966
Yeah!

11:17.219 --> 11:18.262
Encore.

11:18.345 --> 11:19.388
Encore!

11:19.471 --> 11:21.014
We did it, pal.

11:23.100 --> 11:25.477
I hope we made you proud.

11:25.561 --> 11:29.398
You did.That performance was fierce.

11:32.693 --> 11:35.112
"A Token Of Toughness."

11:37.781 --> 11:41.285
The road to gloryis not traveled in a day.

11:42.870 --> 11:47.958
But after hardship upon hardship,I reached the end.

11:48.542 --> 11:50.711
I braved the bitter cold.

11:50.794 --> 11:53.172
I scaled great heights.

11:53.255 --> 11:55.007
Most of allâ€¦

11:55.799 --> 11:58.010
I proved my toughness.

11:58.594 --> 12:00.179
And finally, And finally,

12:00.262 --> 12:02.639
I claimed my prize.

12:03.557 --> 12:04.558
This.

12:05.893 --> 12:08.395
Is that a real dragon scale?

12:08.478 --> 12:09.605
'Tis indeed.

12:09.688 --> 12:13.025
This scale is a symbolof my unbreakable resolve.

12:13.108 --> 12:16.069
I call it my token of toughness.

12:16.153 --> 12:18.197
Usually, I give you your tokens.

12:18.280 --> 12:24.745
But today, you must find your own tokenthat represents an act of toughness.

12:24.828 --> 12:26.997
Just like my dragon scale.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.582
Hear that, Pony?

12:28.665 --> 12:33.545
We're gonna meet a realgiant fire-breathing dragon.

12:33.629 --> 12:36.089
You ready to get fire-breathed at?

12:36.173 --> 12:39.009
I said "like" the dragon scale, Pinecone.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.511
'Tis only an example.

12:40.594 --> 12:44.806
Use my scale as inspirationto get out there

12:44.890 --> 12:48.060
and find a tokenthat means something to you.

12:48.143 --> 12:49.394
Now!

12:50.145 --> 12:52.856
Finding a token as toughas Gladys's won't be a problem.

12:52.940 --> 12:55.192
Come on, pal. Show me your tough face.

12:57.694 --> 12:59.112
We'll work on it.

12:59.196 --> 13:00.572
Let's get toughing. Let's get toughing.

13:00.656 --> 13:02.157
Yeah!

13:02.241 --> 13:06.745
The road to gloryisn't traveled in a day.

13:06.828 --> 13:08.455
Unless you're me.

13:10.832 --> 13:12.125
Cold!

13:12.209 --> 13:14.336
I braved the bitter cold.

13:16.922 --> 13:19.800
I scaled great heights.

13:24.221 --> 13:25.472
Whoops.

13:25.556 --> 13:31.061
No, higher. Higher. The highest heights.

13:34.940 --> 13:39.611
Most of all, I proved my toughness.

13:45.742 --> 13:48.161
There. Three tokens.

13:48.245 --> 13:50.747
Wait. Where'd the cat treat go?

13:51.373 --> 13:53.834
Ah, bud. Glad it found a good home.

13:53.917 --> 13:55.711
Hey, Pinecone. Hey, Pony.

13:55.794 --> 13:57.004
Hawthorn.

13:57.087 --> 14:01.175
I heard the Lil Rumblersare collecting toughness tokens today. I heard the Lil Rumblersare collecting toughness tokens today.

14:01.258 --> 14:02.551
Are those yours?

14:02.634 --> 14:05.762
Yeah. But they're not tough enough.

14:05.846 --> 14:08.223
I didn't even break a sweat getting them.

14:08.974 --> 14:10.142
Isn't that a good thing?

14:10.225 --> 14:11.852
If it's not a challenge,

14:11.935 --> 14:14.855
how is it gonna prove to Gladyshow tough I've become?

14:15.772 --> 14:17.482
There's only one thing to do.

14:17.566 --> 14:21.320
The dragon Gladys got her scale fromstill lives at the highest peak

14:21.403 --> 14:23.113
of the Jagged Mountains.

14:23.197 --> 14:25.449
Care to join me on a quest?

14:26.116 --> 14:28.535
I'm not sure this is wise.

14:28.619 --> 14:31.079
We're not prepared to meet a dragon.

14:31.163 --> 14:33.290
I haven't even studiedtheir greetings yet.

14:33.373 --> 14:36.627
So? You think Gladys knewhow to speak Dragon?

14:36.710 --> 14:38.295
That's what makes this so tough.

14:38.879 --> 14:41.173
I guess it would be pretty cool.

14:41.256 --> 14:42.841
What would be pretty cool?

14:42.925 --> 14:44.968
Hey, Annabelle.

14:45.552 --> 14:46.595
Niceâ€¦

14:48.430 --> 14:50.891
This? Just the tokenof toughness I earned

14:50.974 --> 14:53.227
by sitting fora five-hour portrait painting.

14:53.310 --> 14:56.939
With. No. Breaks.

14:57.022 --> 15:00.359
Feel free to copy my idea if youhaven't thought of anything as good. Feel free to copy my idea if youhaven't thought of anything as good.

15:00.442 --> 15:04.112
Actually, the token I'm about to getis even tougher.

15:04.196 --> 15:06.073
She wants a dragon scale.

15:07.282 --> 15:09.201
A dragon scale?

15:09.284 --> 15:12.579
Of course. I considered getting one too.

15:12.663 --> 15:15.624
I just didn't think it'd be fairto the rest of the Rumblers.

15:15.707 --> 15:19.253
Then what are we waiting for?Race you to the mountain.

15:20.295 --> 15:21.964
I can't wait!

15:22.047 --> 15:23.966
A real dragon.

15:26.510 --> 15:27.845
According to my book,

15:27.928 --> 15:32.558
the dragon is known for its fiery breath,sharp claws and earthshaking roar.

15:34.142 --> 15:35.561
That's the one.

15:35.644 --> 15:37.938
So the dragon has a loud roar.

15:38.021 --> 15:39.189
Big deal.

15:39.273 --> 15:41.400
It's not like a roar could be dangerous.

15:47.614 --> 15:48.740
Watch out!

15:52.578 --> 15:53.996
Not dangerous, huh?

15:54.079 --> 15:55.205
Come on.

15:55.289 --> 15:59.293
That wasn't danger.That was excitement.

15:59.376 --> 16:04.339
Yeah, well, I think I've had enough"excitement" for one day. Yeah, well, I think I've had enough"excitement" for one day.

16:04.840 --> 16:06.341
I'm heading home, Pinecone.

16:06.425 --> 16:09.136
And I suggest you three do the same.

16:09.219 --> 16:10.679
Don't you wanna see the dragon?

16:10.762 --> 16:15.225
Sure, if we were preparedfor it, but we're not.

16:15.309 --> 16:18.061
I don't want youto get yourself hurt, okay?

16:20.480 --> 16:22.065
Don't listen to him, Pony.

16:22.149 --> 16:24.902
He's just not readyto tough it out like we are.

16:24.985 --> 16:26.153
Right, Annabelle?

16:26.236 --> 16:27.905
Naturally.

16:27.988 --> 16:32.201
If you're getting a scale,there's no way I'm leaving empty-handed.

16:32.284 --> 16:35.037
Exactly. We can do this!

16:43.795 --> 16:45.422
Don't be scared, Pony.

16:45.506 --> 16:47.466
It's just a rickety bridge.

16:48.467 --> 16:50.636
If it were easy, it wouldn't be tough.

16:50.719 --> 16:52.888
Come on. I'll go first.

16:54.806 --> 16:55.891
Pony.

17:01.230 --> 17:04.441
Almost. Almost.

17:05.567 --> 17:07.027
See. You did it!

17:09.404 --> 17:11.240
Your turn, Annabelle.

17:11.323 --> 17:12.324
Coming.

17:13.992 --> 17:15.911
You know what? I'm done too.

17:15.993 --> 17:17.162
What?

17:17.246 --> 17:21.415
But what about getting a scaleand proving your toughness?

17:21.500 --> 17:25.378
I'm plenty toughwithout falling off a cliff.

17:25.462 --> 17:29.258
Besides, I have my token already.Thank you very much.

17:29.800 --> 17:33.428
Listen, Pinecone, this quest isn't tough.

17:33.512 --> 17:34.972
It's reckless.

17:35.597 --> 17:39.309
As your elder by two whole years,I think you should turn back too.

17:43.856 --> 17:46.900
Okay. Just be safe.

17:48.151 --> 17:50.571
More scales for us, right, pal?

18:02.165 --> 18:03.709
Come on, bud.

18:03.792 --> 18:05.294
Almost done.

18:05.377 --> 18:08.255
All we have to do is go inand get our scale.

18:08.338 --> 18:10.716
I can almost hear the victory cheers.

18:10.799 --> 18:14.344
Go, Pinecone. Go, Pony.You did it. Uh-huh.

18:19.600 --> 18:22.269
That was a big one, eh, pal?

18:22.352 --> 18:24.062
Okay, here we go.

18:24.688 --> 18:27.482
The ultimate test of our toughness.

18:27.566 --> 18:28.567
Huh?

18:29.234 --> 18:30.944
Pony, don't you wanna go in?

18:33.530 --> 18:35.741
But I can't give up now.

18:35.824 --> 18:37.117
I've come so far.

18:37.201 --> 18:41.288
And if I go back without a scale, wellâ€¦

18:41.371 --> 18:42.456
You wait here.

18:42.539 --> 18:45.125
I'll bring back enough gloryfor the both of us.

18:54.927 --> 18:56.470
Okay.

18:56.553 --> 18:59.014
It's a little bigger than I expected.

19:02.059 --> 19:04.144
Time to be tough, Pinecone.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.787
What am I doing?

19:21.870 --> 19:23.914
Having a scale to show offwon't mean anything

19:23.997 --> 19:25.916
if I don't make it back in one piece.

19:37.803 --> 19:39.137
Easy there.

19:39.221 --> 19:42.558
You don't want to pick a fightwith the great--

19:45.936 --> 19:48.063
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come.

19:48.146 --> 19:49.648
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

19:49.731 --> 19:53.735
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

20:03.203 --> 20:06.123
Thank you. Thank you.How can I ever repay--

20:07.916 --> 20:10.544
We'll talk later. Faster, Pony. Faster!

20:10.627 --> 20:12.462
Careful. The bridge!

20:17.217 --> 20:18.760
Look out!

20:21.263 --> 20:24.558
-We should go back for her.-She's fine, right?

20:25.893 --> 20:27.603
Ouch. Whoa!

20:28.979 --> 20:32.566
Pinecone, are you okay?I'm so sorry we left you.

20:33.150 --> 20:36.403
No, it's okay. You were right.

20:36.486 --> 20:39.948
You didn't get your scale?

20:40.532 --> 20:43.452
The dragon was huge and scary.

20:43.535 --> 20:46.163
And I bailed.

20:47.331 --> 20:49.583
I didn't prove my toughness at all.

20:49.666 --> 20:51.084
I just ran.

20:53.086 --> 20:56.298
I just wish I at leasthad something to show for it.

20:57.007 --> 20:58.759
I feel like such a failure.

21:00.385 --> 21:03.639
You really think I should keep this?

21:05.057 --> 21:07.518
Excellent sudoku, Oatcake.

21:07.601 --> 21:10.854
You held fasttill the puzzle was defeated.

21:11.480 --> 21:12.648
Pinecone, your turn.

21:12.731 --> 21:14.483
What token do you have to show us?

21:14.566 --> 21:15.734
Iâ€¦

21:17.819 --> 21:19.238
I went to the Jagged Mountains

21:19.321 --> 21:22.658
because I wanted to geta dragon scale like yours.

21:22.741 --> 21:26.578
But all I have to show for it is this.

21:30.958 --> 21:33.377
No, no. Let me see.

21:33.961 --> 21:36.004
This brings back memories.

21:36.088 --> 21:39.049
I had a similar experienceon my first try.

21:39.883 --> 21:40.926
First try?

21:41.009 --> 21:44.137
One does not simply waltzinto a dragon's lair

21:44.221 --> 21:47.182
and grab a scale their first timeup the mountain.

21:47.266 --> 21:51.228
That dragon only let me have thisafter I visited year after year.

21:51.311 --> 21:55.774
Patience and perseveranceare what toughing it out is all about.

21:56.358 --> 21:59.987
But I thought tough stuff had to be hard.

22:00.070 --> 22:01.530
And it was.

22:02.364 --> 22:06.451
Just as I imagineadmitting defeat was hard for you,

22:06.535 --> 22:08.161
but it was the right decision.

22:09.121 --> 22:11.665
Sometimes walking away to try another day

22:11.748 --> 22:13.834
can be the toughest thing of all.

22:13.917 --> 22:15.252
Here goes nothing.

22:16.670 --> 22:21.967
Behold the first installmentin my lifelong token of toughness series.

22:22.050 --> 22:24.845
It may not be a dragon scale, butâ€¦

22:27.139 --> 22:28.473
I'll get there one day.

22:30.100 --> 22:31.810
Wanna try again tomorrow?

22:35.439 --> 22:37.274
You and I

22:37.357 --> 22:40.027
Adventurers brave and free

22:40.903 --> 22:45.157
Side by sideTogether we'll always be

22:45.240 --> 22:49.745
Thick as thieves

22:50.787 --> 22:55.209
Thick as thieves
