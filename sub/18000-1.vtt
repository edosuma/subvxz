Have you guys heard
of the Hunger Games?

00:13.107 --> 00:14.174
Yeah, the movie,
the book?

00:14.208 --> 00:15.275
- You saw it?
- Yeah.

00:15.309 --> 00:16.776
It was intense,
but I was thinking,

00:16.811 --> 00:18.712
You know, what happens if,
you know,

00:18.746 --> 00:20.714
In the future, like,
store employees

00:20.748 --> 00:22.616
Are the new targets
of the Hunger Games?

00:22.650 --> 00:25.986
We are picked, and we're all...
we have to go into the forest.

- Obama shows up.
- Yeah.

00:27.088 --> 00:28.255
[laughter]

00:28.289 --> 00:31.458
He's like, "Hey, guys. Did a lottery.

00:31.492 --> 00:33.793
You guys are gonna have to fight it out."

00:33.828 --> 00:36.329
- A battle to the death?
- In a battle to the death.

00:36.364 --> 00:37.797
Ooh! Uh...

00:37.832 --> 00:39.866
First off, Mike is sleeping.
You stumble up on him.

00:39.901 --> 00:42.235
You got your knife in your hand.

00:42.270 --> 00:44.804
You can slice his throat from ear to ear.

00:44.839 --> 00:45.805
Could you do it?

00:45.840 --> 00:48.275
[sighs]

00:48.309 --> 00:52.279
Are you gonna murder me, Ming?

00:52.313 --> 00:55.348
If it's between you
and me, I-I would do it.

00:55.383 --> 00:57.284
But guess what. I wasn't sleeping.

00:57.318 --> 00:59.085
It was a trap. [laughter]

00:59.120 --> 01:01.087

The adventures

- Good. How are you?
- What have we got today?

02:05.286 --> 02:08.321
- Archie comics, number 18.
- Ooh.

02:08.356 --> 02:10.457
Archie. That's an oldie, man.

02:17.198 --> 02:18.732
- Is that Archie?
- Yeah.

02:18.766 --> 02:20.567
- [laughs]
- That's, uh...

02:20.601 --> 02:22.836
- Looks like Richie Cunningham.
- He's got a bubble butt.

02:22.870 --> 02:24.170
This is Archie in the early days

02:24.205 --> 02:25.905
Before he was refined.

02:25.940 --> 02:29.309
- This is probably circa 19...
- '46.

02:29.343 --> 02:31.578
'46, man, when america's feeling great.

02:31.612 --> 02:33.413
Just vanquished some nazis.

02:33.447 --> 02:34.714
Do you keep up with the current state

02:34.749 --> 02:36.216
- Of Archie universe?
- I sure do.

02:36.250 --> 02:38.985
There's a lot of new-fangled
stuff thrown out there, man.

02:39.020 --> 02:40.020
Yes.

02:40.054 --> 02:41.154
All of a sudden now the real world,

02:41.188 --> 02:42.455
It's crashing in on Archie's head.

02:42.490 --> 02:44.090
Like, shoehorning in

02:44.125 --> 02:46.226
What's current in pop culture, like Glee.

02:46.260 --> 02:47.927
Yeah, there is a Glee crossover right now.

02:47.928 --> 02:48.928
[groans]

02:48.963 --> 02:49.929
But it's only for a few issues.

It's not gonna last forever.

02:51.332 --> 02:52.632

think it's a good thing.

02:52.667 --> 02:54.200
[laughter]

02:54.235 --> 02:57.270
I'm afraid, you know, maybe
that they're setting it up

02:57.305 --> 03:00.473
For Archie to start placating
to today's youth, which...

03:00.507 --> 03:01.975
- [laughs] Yeah.
- I don't know if I'm...

03:02.009 --> 03:03.977
'cause what a crime that would be

03:04.011 --> 03:05.845
To have Archie be relatable

03:05.880 --> 03:08.581
To today's youth instead
of today's youth being like,

03:08.616 --> 03:09.582
"why am I reading

03:09.617 --> 03:11.785
"about a guy in the 1950s

"who hangs out at a malt shop?

"this doesn't look like...

03:27.001 --> 03:29.436
Where'd you get this from?

03:29.470 --> 03:31.538
I'm actually a longtime Archie collector.

03:31.572 --> 03:33.006
And what's your earliest Archie?

03:33.040 --> 03:35.942
- I have Pep 22.
- What is Pep 22?

03:35.976 --> 03:37.210
It's the first appearance of Archie Andrews

03:37.244 --> 03:38.545
And Betty and Jughead.

03:38.579 --> 03:40.146
It sounds like you're
really passionate about it.

03:40.181 --> 03:42.549
Yes. They mean a lot to me.

03:42.583 --> 03:43.717
I've got Jughead tattooed on me.

03:43.751 --> 03:45.085
- Really?
- Yes.

03:45.119 --> 03:46.586
- Where is it?
- I can't show you.

03:46.620 --> 03:48.621
- Can you show me?
- Maybe later.

03:48.656 --> 03:50.223
And so you're partial to
Jughead over Archie then?

03:50.257 --> 03:51.691
Yes.

03:51.726 --> 03:54.127
Which Archie character
did you relate to most?

03:54.161 --> 03:55.128
Maybe Reggie.

03:55.162 --> 03:57.764
Reggie? [laughter]

03:57.798 --> 04:00.400

I mean, I was...
Definitely wasn't Archie.

04:05.439 --> 04:07.039
I wasn't Jughead, like,

04:07.058 --> 04:08.908
Brain-dead just looking
for a hamburger everywhere.

04:08.942 --> 04:11.611
What's that supposed to mean?

04:11.645 --> 04:13.213
Well, how much do you want for it?

04:13.247 --> 04:15.181
- 200.
- 200?

04:15.216 --> 04:17.450
3.5.
That's low, right?

04:17.485 --> 04:19.319
That's usually what girls grade me.

04:19.353 --> 04:20.320
If I were to be CGC.

04:20.353 --> 04:21.454
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:21.488 --> 04:22.822
- You're 3.5?
- Yeah.

04:22.857 --> 04:26.760
If that's 3.5 out of
100, they're grading me.

04:26.794 --> 04:28.461
What year were you "manufactured"?

04:28.496 --> 04:31.464
- '67.
- Okay, so silver age.

04:31.499 --> 04:34.401
[laughter]

04:34.435 --> 04:37.470
Silver age!

04:37.505 --> 04:38.705
- It's not worth it.
- Am I complimented?

04:38.739 --> 04:40.640
- I don't know.
- I don't think so.

04:40.674 --> 04:42.909
It didn't sound good though.

04:42.943 --> 04:44.344
He doesn't want this book.

04:44.378 --> 04:46.913
[laughter]

04:46.947 --> 04:48.948
Would you do 120?

04:48.983 --> 04:50.717
100 bucks. That's it though.

04:50.751 --> 04:51.885
I can't go any higher than that.

04:51.919 --> 04:53.219
Yeah?

04:53.254 --> 04:54.454
It's absolutely the best
I can do for you today.

04:54.488 --> 04:55.655
I can do that.

04:55.689 --> 04:56.923
And even that, I'm kind of
second-guessing,

04:56.957 --> 04:58.291
Even as I speak.

04:58.325 --> 04:59.659
Let me quickly give you the money then.

04:59.693 --> 05:01.694
- Sure.
- [laughs] 100 bucks.

05:04.865 --> 05:07.567
All right, so you know
I didn't palm anything.

05:07.601 --> 05:08.802
There you go.

05:08.836 --> 05:09.803
- Awesome.
- Thank you.

05:09.837 --> 05:11.838
Thank you. Bye.

05:25.319 --> 05:27.921
Excuse me? Hello?

05:27.955 --> 05:31.157
Which one of you is
Bryan Johnson?

05:31.192 --> 05:32.592
You're the Incredible Hulk!

05:32.626 --> 05:36.629
When Lou Ferrigno strides up
to the counter at the Stash,

05:36.664 --> 05:37.947
It's surreal.

05:37.982 --> 05:39.666
It was like a dream.

05:39.700 --> 05:41.434
That dream we all have
when Lou Ferrigno comes in

05:41.468 --> 05:42.819
And says, "Which one of
you is Bryan Johnson?"

05:42.853 --> 05:45.405
Maybe it was more of a
nightmare, I didn't know...

05:45.439 --> 05:46.639
You know,
it was just the size discrepancy

05:46.674 --> 05:49.042
Between me and him...
I look like a kid, right?

05:49.076 --> 05:50.310
Next to kids, you look like a kid.

05:50.344 --> 05:51.478
[laughter]

05:53.347 --> 05:55.915
- Are you Bryan Johnson?
- I am, yeah.

05:55.950 --> 05:57.417
Your buddy, Kevin Smith,

05:57.451 --> 06:01.354
Hired me for the next four to eight hours

06:01.388 --> 06:05.091
To motivate, train, and
to get you back in shape.

06:05.125 --> 06:06.626
Kevin sent you?

06:06.660 --> 06:07.627
Yes.

06:07.661 --> 06:08.962
I came all the way from California

06:08.996 --> 06:11.297
For you to train with the Hulk.

06:11.332 --> 06:13.316
Lou Ferrigno was at this con, man.

06:13.367 --> 06:16.235
And he came over, and we were chitchatting.

06:16.253 --> 06:19.339
So he brought up the
suggestion of getting in shape,

06:19.373 --> 06:20.907
But I didn't want to do it myself

06:20.941 --> 06:23.693
Because, you know, what if
he was real-deal about it?

06:23.744 --> 06:25.495
- What if he's a drill sergeant?
- [laughs]

06:25.529 --> 06:28.047
I wanted to send somebody
ahead of me,

06:28.082 --> 06:30.383
A guinea pig, if you will,
a Steve Rogers, if you will.

06:30.417 --> 06:33.419
- Ohh.
- And I thought about you.

06:33.454 --> 06:35.538
You always talk about
wanting to get in shape,

06:35.573 --> 06:37.056
And you're like, "If I had

06:37.091 --> 06:38.858
My own personal trainer..."

06:38.893 --> 06:39.993
And I was like,

06:40.027 --> 06:42.262
"Well, you know, maybe
with the Incredible Hulk.

06:42.296 --> 06:44.697
- That's kind of fun."
- Sorry you're...

06:44.732 --> 06:46.098
- [laughter]
- You're fat.

06:46.116 --> 06:47.600
[laughter]

06:47.635 --> 06:49.469
I think you two are gonna need to leave.

06:49.503 --> 06:50.570
- Nah.
- Yes, sir.

06:50.604 --> 06:51.838
No, I'm out of here.

06:51.872 --> 06:53.773
- Leave? Really?
- No, you. Leave.

06:53.807 --> 06:55.542
Okay.

06:55.576 --> 06:57.377
You know, Kevin told me

06:57.411 --> 06:58.611
You used to be in phenomenal shape.

06:58.646 --> 07:00.280
You used to be a good-looking guy.

07:00.314 --> 07:01.781
- I mean, I don't know...
- Used to be?

07:01.815 --> 07:03.049
What you looked like before.

07:03.083 --> 07:04.217
Do you have pictures of
what you looked like before?

07:04.251 --> 07:06.085
Yeah. Yeah.
Actually I do.

07:08.022 --> 07:10.023
Oh, my God.

07:14.228 --> 07:15.995
- How long ago?
- Six years ago.

07:16.030 --> 07:17.430
I was hiking with my friend
in New Zealand.

07:17.464 --> 07:20.800
Wow. I mean, look at you.

07:20.834 --> 07:23.736
This is like, uh, Harrison Ford.
Yeah.

07:23.771 --> 07:25.004
Watch this.

07:25.039 --> 07:28.241
- That was one for the ladies.
- Man!

07:28.275 --> 07:29.576
Do you want to get back to shape?

07:29.610 --> 07:31.644
Yeah. I would
absolutely love it.

07:31.679 --> 07:32.912
Exactly, because your
health is important.

07:32.947 --> 07:34.414
So I can get back to this,
you think?

07:34.448 --> 07:35.782
Even at this advanced age?

07:35.816 --> 07:37.884
Doesn't matter. I'm 61.

07:37.918 --> 07:40.987
You should have no problem.
I'm gonna get you started.

07:41.021 --> 07:42.355
The Hulk is here.

07:42.389 --> 07:44.390
- All right.
- Hope I didn't scare you.

07:44.425 --> 07:45.758
[grunts]

07:45.793 --> 07:47.660
Just like that. One. Perfect.

07:47.695 --> 07:49.195
Oh, good Lord.

07:49.229 --> 07:51.264
I'm looking for the
first appearance of Elektra.

07:51.298 --> 07:54.100
Oh, wow.
Daredevil 168.

08:02.363 --> 08:04.164
All right, Bryan.

08:04.198 --> 08:05.565
We're gonna do one of
my favorite exercises.

08:05.599 --> 08:07.167
All you have to do is
imitate the Hulk.

08:07.201 --> 08:08.835
So just start freaking
out and wrecking the place?

08:08.869 --> 08:10.070
- Exactly.
- That kind of thing?

08:10.104 --> 08:11.871
Do you know when you do
the Hulk pose?

08:11.906 --> 08:13.540
- This? I'm good at this.
- Right, exactly.

08:13.574 --> 08:16.343
That's exactly what
we're gonna do now.

08:16.377 --> 08:18.511
It'd been a while since
I'd been in a gym obviously.

08:18.546 --> 08:19.579
Pfft.

08:19.613 --> 08:20.747
You want a smack in the face?

08:20.781 --> 08:23.149
[laughter]

08:23.184 --> 08:24.617
But it was strange, like,

08:24.652 --> 08:26.353
'cause it's one of those
moments where you think back

08:26.387 --> 08:28.271
And watching the Hulk as a kid,

08:28.322 --> 08:29.556
Sitting there on a Friday night,

08:29.590 --> 08:31.925
Never in a million years would you think,

08:31.959 --> 08:33.259
Someday I'll be so out of shape,

08:33.294 --> 08:35.294
This guy will have to
travel thousands of miles

08:35.328 --> 08:38.181
To drive it into my head
that I need to lose weight.

08:38.215 --> 08:39.499
[laughter]

08:39.533 --> 08:40.700
As you come down,

08:40.735 --> 08:42.434
I want you to try to touch my fist.

08:42.470 --> 08:43.570
Okay.

08:43.604 --> 08:45.405
Slow. Just like that, right?

08:45.439 --> 08:46.573
See? You doing the Hulk pose.

08:46.607 --> 08:47.574
- I look like the Hulk?
- Yeah.

08:47.608 --> 08:49.109
- Perfect.
- Am I green?

08:49.143 --> 08:51.077
Keep the tension.
Good. Keep going.

08:51.112 --> 08:53.380
- [grunts]
- Perfect!

08:55.082 --> 08:57.117
When you were doing
the Hulk TV show,

08:57.151 --> 08:58.485
What was your workout like?

08:58.519 --> 09:00.053
I never trained on the set,

09:00.087 --> 09:02.122
Because if I pump on
the show, I would sweat,

09:02.156 --> 09:03.890
And the makeup would have
a tendency to be running.

09:03.924 --> 09:04.891
You know, what I would do is

09:04.925 --> 09:06.292
Maybe train afterwards sometimes,

09:06.327 --> 09:07.627
- Like, 2:00 in the morning.
- Oh.

09:07.661 --> 09:09.396
I was in that freakin' makeup...

09:09.430 --> 09:11.264
- [laughs]
- 14 hours a day.

09:11.298 --> 09:15.235
Six coats of makeup. Pancake makeup.

09:15.269 --> 09:16.703
I would be in the motorhome,

09:16.737 --> 09:18.772
I had to be refrigerated with
my arms straight out like this

09:18.806 --> 09:20.940
To keep the temperature
because I didn't want to sweat.

09:20.975 --> 09:22.475
You wonder why I was so
pissed off as the hulk.

09:22.510 --> 09:23.476
[laughs]

09:23.511 --> 09:25.412
There are very few faces

09:25.446 --> 09:29.115
That are instantly
recognizable as a superhero.

09:29.150 --> 09:31.251
Lou Ferrigno, of course,
will always be the Hulk.

09:31.285 --> 09:33.853
That's how iconic the guy actually is.

09:33.888 --> 09:35.722
He looks just like
he looked in the show.

09:35.756 --> 09:38.658
I mean, he's that massive
still. He's that impressive.

09:38.692 --> 09:41.394
The only person on the planet
who will ever play the Hulk.

09:41.429 --> 09:42.679
- Yeah.
- I mean,

09:42.713 --> 09:44.547
- It'll never happen again.
- Excellent point, man.

09:44.598 --> 09:46.049
With all due respect to Mark Ruffalo,

09:46.100 --> 09:48.168
Who did a wonderful job,
you'll never see a human Hulk.

09:48.202 --> 09:51.771
It'll forever be CGI, some
computer-created version.

09:51.806 --> 09:52.906
I don't know, give me
a little bit longer, man.

09:52.940 --> 09:54.674
You never know.

09:54.708 --> 09:56.009
[laughter]

09:56.043 --> 09:58.978
One, two. Just like that.

09:59.013 --> 10:01.214
So I want you to do some now.

10:01.248 --> 10:02.782
I think I'm gonna be good at this

10:02.817 --> 10:04.184
'cause it's laying down, right?

10:04.218 --> 10:06.553
- I know.
- [grunts]

10:06.587 --> 10:07.754
Let the air go out of your chest.

10:07.788 --> 10:09.856
Just like that. One. Perfect.

10:09.890 --> 10:11.024
[sighs]
Good Lord.

10:11.058 --> 10:12.292
Do maybe, like, 15, 20,

10:12.326 --> 10:14.027
Till you feel you can't do anymore.

10:14.061 --> 10:15.595
- [grunts]
- Perfect.

10:15.629 --> 10:17.297
That's got to be 20 by now, right?

10:17.331 --> 10:18.465
[sighs]

10:18.499 --> 10:20.266
Could you see a difference in your body?

10:20.301 --> 10:24.671
Um, after 15 minutes,
one of my lungs deflated.

10:24.705 --> 10:27.507
I was like, "A little help.
I'm having a stroke."

10:27.541 --> 10:29.075
[laughter]

10:29.109 --> 10:31.110
I've been doing this for 50 years.

10:31.145 --> 10:33.313
50 years.
I know what I'm talking about.

10:33.347 --> 10:34.881
50 years.

10:34.915 --> 10:36.549
So by the time I'm 95,
I'm gonna look like you?

10:36.584 --> 10:37.550
- Of course.
- All right.

10:37.585 --> 10:38.718
- All right.
- Maybe before.

10:38.752 --> 10:41.154
Let's see, let's see the...
Oh, man.

10:41.188 --> 10:42.522
I do one of these like this, right?

10:42.556 --> 10:43.590
- See? See?
- I like it, man.

10:43.624 --> 10:44.724
Okay.

10:46.694 --> 10:48.461
[grunting]

10:48.496 --> 10:51.331
When I was a kid, I
was fascinated with power.

10:51.365 --> 10:54.634
When I read the comics, I
fantasized about the Hulk

10:54.668 --> 10:56.803
Because my whole life I was an angry kid

10:56.837 --> 10:59.072
Because of my hearing loss and my speech.

10:59.106 --> 11:00.807
People made fun of me,
they called me "Deaf Louie,"

11:00.841 --> 11:02.909
"Deaf Mute" because of my hearing.

11:02.943 --> 11:04.377
I never felt sorry for myself.

11:04.411 --> 11:07.213
I said to myself, "I'm gonna
be so strong, so powerful,

11:07.248 --> 11:09.549
Nothing's gonna destroy me, pick on me."

11:09.583 --> 11:11.117
Did you go back and kick their asses

11:11.151 --> 11:12.519
- After you got all big?
- You know something?

11:12.553 --> 11:14.320
They turned out to be my biggest fans.

11:14.355 --> 11:15.722
- Give me two more.
- Look at that.

11:15.756 --> 11:16.789
- Come on.
- Two more?

11:16.824 --> 11:17.891
- Come on.
- No problem.

11:17.925 --> 11:20.760
Good.

11:20.794 --> 11:22.962
All right, Bryan.
Great job.

11:22.997 --> 11:24.297
- Thanks.
- I'm proud of you.

11:24.331 --> 11:26.399
Listen, ten more minutes
on the elliptical trainer,

11:26.433 --> 11:27.667
Cool down.

11:27.701 --> 11:29.969
I will see you tomorrow
morning at the comic bookstore.

11:30.004 --> 11:31.070
- All right.
- All right?

11:31.105 --> 11:32.071
- I'll be there.
- Okay.

11:32.106 --> 11:33.106
- Thanks again.
- All right.

11:33.140 --> 11:35.041
Daredevil 168.
Frank Miller.

11:35.075 --> 11:37.277
- The Frank Miller.
- That's a key book.

11:37.311 --> 11:39.946
I want you to tell me
exactly what you eat a day.

11:39.980 --> 11:41.581
Usually a whole bunch of doughnuts.

11:41.615 --> 11:42.715
Doughnuts?

11:44.247 --> 11:47.182
The moment they announced
Ben Affleck as Batman,

11:47.200 --> 11:50.119
My face had a Joker-like rictus grin.

11:50.153 --> 11:53.255
It was like, oh, my God.
I know Batman!

11:53.289 --> 11:55.024
I put Batman in movies!

11:55.058 --> 11:56.125
He's played a villain in movies for me.

11:56.159 --> 11:58.994
If this was happening
in the mid '90s,

11:59.029 --> 12:00.829
When, like, I was thick
as thieves with Affleck,

12:00.864 --> 12:02.614
- I'd be the Penguin.
- Oh, yeah.

12:02.649 --> 12:03.832
- Right?
- Yeah.

12:03.867 --> 12:06.285
I can get Mewes cast as The Riddler,

12:06.336 --> 12:07.636
Jay as The Riddler.

12:07.671 --> 12:10.072
We could be P.A.S.

12:10.106 --> 12:11.607
[laughter]

12:11.641 --> 12:13.709
What'd you think of
some of the reactions?

12:13.743 --> 12:16.328
It was so strange to
watch the internet blow up.

12:16.363 --> 12:18.080
I read an article where they said

12:18.114 --> 12:20.115
In the first hour on Twitter,

12:20.150 --> 12:23.686
71% of the tweets about Ben
were negative,

12:23.720 --> 12:26.055
And 16% were neutral,

12:26.089 --> 12:28.690
And then the rest of
the percent was me going,

12:28.708 --> 12:30.092
"This is awesome!"

12:30.126 --> 12:33.128
[laughter]
"This is gonna rock!"

12:41.583 --> 12:44.652
Hey, did you ever watch
any zombie movies or TV shows?

12:44.686 --> 12:47.621
You never see the humans,
like, gagging or dry-heaving.

12:47.656 --> 12:49.123
Those zombies must smell.

12:49.157 --> 12:51.091
It's like, they're just
walking rotting flesh, right?

12:51.126 --> 12:52.960
Did you ever smell a dead body?

12:52.994 --> 12:55.529
- No, I haven't, have you?
- No.

12:57.065 --> 12:58.499
Come on.
Of course I have.

12:58.533 --> 13:00.468
- [laughter]
- Really?

13:00.502 --> 13:01.469
How you doing?

13:01.503 --> 13:03.003
- Hey, how's it going?
- Good.

13:03.038 --> 13:04.638
I'm looking for the
first appearance of Elektra.

13:04.673 --> 13:06.907
- Daredevil 168, right?
- That's the one.

13:12.981 --> 13:14.515
Frank Miller.

13:14.549 --> 13:15.783
The Frank Miller.

13:15.817 --> 13:17.051
- That's a key book...
- Yes, it is.

13:17.085 --> 13:18.352
You're looking for today.

13:18.386 --> 13:19.453
Well, I've got a near
complete run

13:19.488 --> 13:20.654
Of Frank Miller in Daredevil.

13:20.689 --> 13:22.256
I'm looking to finish it off with this.

13:22.290 --> 13:23.691
Oh, really?

13:23.725 --> 13:25.359
This will be the last issue,
and you have a complete run?

13:25.393 --> 13:26.494
The last one.

13:26.528 --> 13:28.062
Probably the second most valuable one

13:28.096 --> 13:29.129
Behind the 158.

13:29.164 --> 13:30.264
Mm-hmm.

13:30.298 --> 13:31.565
I was a kid buying this off the rack,

13:31.600 --> 13:32.867
And I immediately sensed

13:32.901 --> 13:34.368
That there's something
special in this book.

13:34.402 --> 13:36.437
I mean, in the '80s, it wasn't doing

13:36.471 --> 13:38.672
Well enough to even be
a monthly for Marvel,

13:38.707 --> 13:40.207
And Miller came in

13:40.242 --> 13:42.443
With a shot of unseen excitement

13:42.477 --> 13:44.378
In terms of, like...

13:44.412 --> 13:46.614
Is that a pun? "Unseen"
'cause he's blind?

13:46.648 --> 13:47.648
[laughter]

13:47.682 --> 13:49.650
- Look at you.
- That's good.

13:49.684 --> 13:51.819
Frank Miller, who
most people, of course,

13:51.853 --> 13:53.921
Know from The Dark Knight Returns,

13:53.955 --> 13:57.308
Before he went over to DC,
turned Daredevil

13:57.342 --> 13:59.627
From, like, the guy in those
red tights with little horns

13:59.661 --> 14:01.195
Into shakespearean.

14:01.229 --> 14:02.396
He humanized...

14:02.430 --> 14:03.831
- Yeah.
- That character,

14:03.865 --> 14:04.982
Brought passionate writing.

14:05.016 --> 14:06.200
I think it ushered in

14:06.234 --> 14:08.669
For Marvel the era of
the sophisticated hero.

14:08.703 --> 14:10.538
He did, he kind of
upped the ante at Marvel,

14:10.572 --> 14:13.774
And it was really the blueprint
for Dark Knight Returns.

14:13.808 --> 14:15.175
Who is Elektra?
How the...

14:15.210 --> 14:16.777
Is she... it's his girlfriend?

14:16.811 --> 14:19.580
Elektra is his one true love.

14:19.614 --> 14:22.149
They were, like, college lovers, I think.

14:22.183 --> 14:24.385
Although Daredevil,
Matt Murdock,

14:24.419 --> 14:25.619
Is the mack daddy, man.

14:25.654 --> 14:26.654
I don't know if there's any superhero

14:26.688 --> 14:29.156
That has gotten more,

14:29.190 --> 14:31.392
Uh, well, more girlfriends.

14:31.426 --> 14:32.693
- It's like...
- It's the sonar.

14:32.727 --> 14:34.028
It's the sonar. He can tell.

14:34.062 --> 14:35.029
For me, it'd have to
be the other way around.

14:35.063 --> 14:36.297
The girls would have to be blind.

14:36.331 --> 14:37.598
Then I could get 'em.

14:37.632 --> 14:39.733
[laughter]

14:39.768 --> 14:41.035
Is that an official CGC rating?

14:41.069 --> 14:42.369
I see that it says "beautiful copy."

14:42.404 --> 14:46.006
[laughter]

14:46.041 --> 14:47.474
That's the Mike seal
of approval right there.

14:47.509 --> 14:48.475
Okay. I'm good with it then.

14:48.510 --> 14:49.610
This is a beautiful copy.

14:49.644 --> 14:51.845
I mean, I'm not even gonna imagine...

14:51.880 --> 14:52.913
I'm just gonna ring her up and...

14:52.948 --> 14:54.181
'cause, I mean, it's the way...

14:54.215 --> 14:55.849
Actually I was hoping
to pay about 60 for it.

14:55.884 --> 14:57.151
Oh, r...
Oh, you...

14:57.185 --> 14:59.320
The last issue that you
need to complete your run.

14:59.354 --> 15:00.454
- We have it.
- Mm-hmm.

15:00.488 --> 15:03.457
Mike has given it a
beautiful copy rating.

15:03.491 --> 15:05.359
- Mm-hmm.
- It's B.C.

15:05.393 --> 15:06.794
I understand that, but, you know,

15:06.828 --> 15:09.229
My allowance only goes as
far as, like, say, 60 bucks.

15:09.264 --> 15:11.565
This is too good to let go for 60 bucks.

15:11.600 --> 15:13.901
I mean, no stress marks.
I mean, it's...

15:13.935 --> 15:16.070
Look at those sharp
corners and vibrant cover.

15:16.104 --> 15:17.638
It's the last one.

15:17.672 --> 15:22.176
You're gonna make a nice boy
from South Jersey very happy.

15:22.210 --> 15:25.679
You know, how about
since it's issue 168...

15:25.714 --> 15:29.049
- Mm-hmm.
- How about 68?

15:30.852 --> 15:32.620
Sold.

15:32.654 --> 15:33.621
- [laughs]
- All right.

15:33.655 --> 15:35.089
Thank you.

15:35.123 --> 15:36.090
Your internal monologue must be like,

15:36.124 --> 15:37.091
"Oh, my God. He went for it."

15:37.125 --> 15:38.759
[laughs]

15:40.662 --> 15:41.629
All right, Bryan.

15:41.663 --> 15:44.098
I want you to tell me right now

15:44.132 --> 15:45.699
Exactly what you eat a day.

15:45.734 --> 15:47.101
For example,
you wake up in the morning.

15:47.135 --> 15:49.803
What's the first thing
you put in your mouth?

15:49.838 --> 15:50.871
First thing I put in my mouth?

15:50.905 --> 15:52.873
Um, my girlfriend's boob.

15:52.907 --> 15:53.874
No, um...

15:53.908 --> 15:55.876
[laughs]

15:55.910 --> 15:57.211
First thing... [laughs]

15:57.245 --> 15:59.413
- That's not bad.
- First... [laughs]

15:59.447 --> 16:01.682
Normally I get up, turn on the TV,

16:01.716 --> 16:04.752
Get a glass of skim milk,

16:04.786 --> 16:06.086
And then a whole bunch of doughnuts.

16:06.121 --> 16:07.788
- Doughnuts?
- Yeah.

16:07.822 --> 16:09.690
Probably eight or ten.

16:09.724 --> 16:10.758
Then after that, then what?

16:10.792 --> 16:12.493
For lunch, normally it's, like,

16:12.527 --> 16:14.561
Pizza or cheeseburger
or something like that.

16:14.596 --> 16:16.130
- Pizza or cheeseburger?
- Yeah.

16:16.164 --> 16:17.931
- That's basically it?
- Mm-hmm.

16:17.966 --> 16:19.333
Well, then there's the afternoon snack,

16:19.367 --> 16:21.502
So I get, like, a cinnamon bun.

16:21.536 --> 16:23.303
I thought about it the
other day 'cause, you know,

16:23.338 --> 16:24.771
I periodically am like,
why am I so damn fat?

16:24.789 --> 16:25.773
And I realized,

16:25.807 --> 16:27.591
Whenever I reach for something

16:27.625 --> 16:29.176
To put in my mouth, it's sugar.

16:29.210 --> 16:31.178
It's definitely a drug of some sort, man.

16:31.212 --> 16:33.047
You can break a tie with it

16:33.081 --> 16:34.281
And look like Lou Ferrigno

16:34.315 --> 16:36.150
Or these cats and whatnot,
but you and I, man,

16:36.184 --> 16:37.401
We're like, sugar!

16:37.452 --> 16:38.569
- We're victims, Walt.
- Yeah.

16:38.603 --> 16:39.570
It's not our fault. We're sick.

16:39.604 --> 16:41.555
[laughter]

16:41.589 --> 16:43.791
Milk or skim milk.

16:43.825 --> 16:45.993
Two eggs.

16:46.027 --> 16:47.661
A banana.

16:47.696 --> 16:50.164
[blender whirring]

16:51.466 --> 16:54.768
To get healthy.

16:54.803 --> 16:56.970
I want to go back
to that classic episode

16:57.005 --> 16:58.105
Where you fought the bear.

16:58.139 --> 16:59.106
Oh, my God.
[laughter]

16:59.140 --> 17:00.140
Was that a real bear?

17:06.551 --> 17:09.253
Mike, are you gonna read
Shirley Jones' new book?

17:09.288 --> 17:11.490
Oh, that's right. That's coming out,
the tell-all.

17:11.523 --> 17:12.723
Talks about threesomes, philandering.

17:12.759 --> 17:15.159
Shirley Jones from
The Partridge Family?

17:15.193 --> 17:16.260
Yeah.

17:16.294 --> 17:18.296
Did you ever have a crush
on Mrs. Partridge, Shirley Jones?

17:18.330 --> 17:19.765
Uh, no. Not her.

17:19.799 --> 17:23.167
I did have a crush on
Mrs. Carol Brady.

17:23.202 --> 17:24.169
It'd be easy to have a crush on her

17:24.203 --> 17:26.671
'cause she's just so nice.

17:26.705 --> 17:28.907
- The mom next door.
- Yup.

17:28.941 --> 17:31.309
My sitcom mom
would have been Mama

17:31.344 --> 17:32.911
From What's Happening!!
Or...

17:32.945 --> 17:34.913
- [laughs]
- Or Florida from Good Times.

17:34.947 --> 17:36.214
Really?

17:36.249 --> 17:38.250
Florida was sassy.
She didn't take any crap.

17:38.284 --> 17:40.318
- No, she didn't.
- How about you?

17:40.353 --> 17:42.854
Go with Who's the Boss?
With Judith Light, Angela.

17:42.889 --> 17:44.656
- Judith Light, huh?
- Yeah.

17:44.690 --> 17:45.657
White bread.

17:45.691 --> 17:47.359
Yeah. She was really
white bread.

17:47.393 --> 17:49.528
Was she the boss, or was
Tony Danza the boss? I...

17:49.562 --> 17:50.862
- [laughs]
- What do you... what would be...

17:50.897 --> 17:52.697
He thinks there's a definitive answer.

17:52.732 --> 17:53.932
[laughter]

17:53.966 --> 17:55.734
I was still trying to figure it out!

17:55.768 --> 17:57.436
What about you, Walt?

17:57.470 --> 17:59.638
I'm gonna go Wilma Flintstone.

17:59.672 --> 18:01.807
She'd give Florida a run
for her money... Wilma.

18:01.841 --> 18:03.108
Now we can go on a double date, right?

18:03.142 --> 18:04.409
What are you talking about?
I thought...

18:04.444 --> 18:05.710
Wait a minute, I thought
this was the mom you wanted.

18:05.745 --> 18:06.878
Yeah, it is.

18:06.913 --> 18:09.047
No, this is the mom
you had a crush on.

18:09.081 --> 18:10.949
- What are you talking about?
- What's the difference?

18:10.983 --> 18:13.084
[laughter]

18:13.119 --> 18:15.120
Oh, Ming.

18:18.057 --> 18:20.292
- Good afternoon.
- Oh!

18:20.326 --> 18:22.594
- Hey.
- [laughs]

18:22.628 --> 18:24.029
How's it going?

18:24.063 --> 18:25.697
It was a great second workout.

18:25.731 --> 18:27.365
You three are looking awfully doughy.

18:27.400 --> 18:29.000
[laughter]

18:29.035 --> 18:30.268
How you feel?

18:30.303 --> 18:31.670
Tired.

18:31.704 --> 18:33.104
Motivated, thanks to Lou.

18:33.139 --> 18:34.372
- Motivated?
- Yeah.

18:34.407 --> 18:36.241
When's the last time
I saw you motivated?

18:36.275 --> 18:37.242
I don't know.

18:37.276 --> 18:39.010
- Sixth grade?
- [laughs]

18:39.045 --> 18:42.180
Well, Mr. Ferrigno, I mean,
I can't thank you enough.

18:42.215 --> 18:45.484
He looks lean, mean, and...
Green.

18:45.518 --> 18:47.819
- [laughter]
- Yeah.

18:47.854 --> 18:49.821
[laughter]

18:49.856 --> 18:52.524
While we had Mr. Ferrigno
in the store,

18:52.558 --> 18:53.525
I couldn't let him go

18:53.543 --> 18:54.993
Without asking him the one question

18:55.027 --> 18:57.162
I've always been dying to ask him.

18:57.196 --> 18:59.898
There was only one time he
actually fought something

18:59.932 --> 19:02.601
- That was a test for the Hulk.
- Okay.

19:02.635 --> 19:04.536
I want to go back
to that classic episode

19:04.570 --> 19:07.639
Of The Incredible Hulk
where you fought the bear.

19:07.673 --> 19:09.508
Oh, my God.
I don't know.

19:09.542 --> 19:11.076
Was that a real bear?

19:11.110 --> 19:12.110
Yes.

19:12.144 --> 19:13.144
I told you that was a real bear!

19:13.179 --> 19:14.779
- I told you!
- You were right.

19:14.814 --> 19:16.615
But...
But that was the greatest scene,

19:16.649 --> 19:17.782
You see the bear just go flying.

19:17.817 --> 19:18.783
Yeah.

19:18.818 --> 19:22.153
[bear growling]

19:26.225 --> 19:28.693
[grunting]

19:33.132 --> 19:35.834
It was a real freaking bear.

19:35.868 --> 19:37.419
They made him put on
the body makeup,

19:37.453 --> 19:38.737
And they're like,
"get in there!"

19:38.771 --> 19:41.072
And the Hulk is like, aah!

19:41.090 --> 19:42.107
[laughter]
Really?

19:42.141 --> 19:43.642
I want to know where they filmed it,

19:43.676 --> 19:44.676
Because on what planet

19:44.710 --> 19:46.578
Do they allow the star of the show

19:46.612 --> 19:48.913
To wrestle a real bear in a moat?

19:48.931 --> 19:50.015
And it was biting his arm.

19:50.049 --> 19:51.249
It was several hundred pounds.

19:51.284 --> 19:52.784
It was a baby bear. It was tough.

19:52.818 --> 19:55.120
I mean, fighting the bear was
almost like trying to move this.

19:55.154 --> 19:56.121
He was solid as a rock.

19:56.155 --> 19:57.389
- Yeah.
- Wow.

19:57.423 --> 19:58.723
- It was fun though.
- That's awesome, man.

19:58.758 --> 20:00.725
- Anyway, it's been a pleasure.
- Thank you so much.

20:00.760 --> 20:02.160
- Thank you, Mr. Ferrigno.
- Thank you.

20:02.194 --> 20:03.395
- And, Bryan, good luck.
- Thank you.

20:03.429 --> 20:05.697
Stay motivated, and...

20:05.731 --> 20:07.799
Don't make me angry,

20:07.833 --> 20:10.068
Because you wouldn't
like me when I'm angry.

20:10.102 --> 20:11.836
[laughter]

20:11.871 --> 20:13.038
And I'll keep that in mind.

20:13.072 --> 20:15.140
Don't make me come back
from California.

20:15.174 --> 20:16.141
Okay. All right.
Bye-bye.

20:16.175 --> 20:17.142
- Bye.
- See you later, man.

20:17.176 --> 20:19.911
Wow, man.

20:19.946 --> 20:21.880
So The Incredible Hulk,

20:21.914 --> 20:24.366
Icon of comic book history, man,

20:24.400 --> 20:26.785
Comes to our little
comic bookstore,

20:26.819 --> 20:28.086
The Secret Stash,

20:28.120 --> 20:30.689
Comes to train you personally.

20:30.723 --> 20:32.457
Are you gonna keep going with this?

20:32.491 --> 20:33.592
[laughs]
No.

20:33.626 --> 20:34.726
[laughter]

20:34.760 --> 20:36.962
It's too hard, right?

20:36.996 --> 20:37.996
- The Hulk or not.
- Give me a break.

20:38.030 --> 20:38.997
Give me a break.

20:39.031 --> 20:41.232
- [laughter]
- And that's it.

20:41.267 --> 20:44.936
Like every multipart
crossover event in comics,

20:44.971 --> 20:46.404
This show is coming to an end, kids.

20:46.439 --> 20:48.673
For Comic Book Men, I'm
your host, Kevin Smith.

20:48.708 --> 20:50.408
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

20:50.443 --> 20:51.943
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

20:51.978 --> 20:54.646
Remember the immortal
words of Gold Five, children.

20:54.664 --> 20:56.915
"Stay on target."
Good night.
