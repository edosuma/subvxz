WEBVTT

00:03.062 --> 00:04.394
<i> Previously on</i> The Resident...

00:04.488 --> 00:05.729
So that means we're going

00:05.748 --> 00:07.231
-to have to talk about hospice.
-Don't. Not yet.

00:07.324 --> 00:08.415
Oh, you can have hospice
for months.

00:08.492 --> 00:10.175
It's a great service
that most people

00:10.327 --> 00:11.993
wait too long to use.

00:12.013 --> 00:14.254
I wouldn't mind
a kid a lot like you.

00:14.331 --> 00:16.907
You want me to be
your sperm donor?

00:17.000 --> 00:18.091
Thank you, Emily.

00:18.185 --> 00:20.244
We'll pass this up
to the complaint division

00:20.262 --> 00:23.397
and discuss the status
of the investigation.

00:26.843 --> 00:28.176
CONRAD:
How is she?

00:28.195 --> 00:30.863
Well, I'll let her
tell you herself.

00:31.014 --> 00:33.348
-Hey, Carol.
-Conrad.

00:33.517 --> 00:36.426
Come and meet my hospice nurse.
This is Janaya.

00:36.445 --> 00:38.612
Hello, Dr. Hawkins.
We met years ago,

00:38.764 --> 00:40.781
when my father was
a patient before he passed.

00:40.933 --> 00:42.115
Darius Purcell.

00:42.284 --> 00:43.950
Yeah, I remember him.
You were in nursing school then.

00:44.103 --> 00:46.119
CAROL:
Now she takes care

00:46.272 --> 00:47.454
-of dying folk like me.
-(soft laughter)

00:47.606 --> 00:48.605
Mom.

00:48.698 --> 00:53.260
AJ gets prickly
when I use the "D" word.

00:53.295 --> 00:54.461
JANAYA:
Dr. Austin, I need you

00:54.613 --> 00:56.129
to help me
review some med dosages

00:56.223 --> 00:58.390
and update Carol's charts

00:58.617 --> 00:59.892
before I go.

01:00.043 --> 01:01.876
Hey, I'll be right back, Mom.

01:01.970 --> 01:03.562
CAROL:
Mm.

01:07.626 --> 01:10.127
Anything I can do for you?

01:10.220 --> 01:12.629
Oh, I have everything I need.

01:12.648 --> 01:15.407
It's AJ I'm worried about.

01:18.470 --> 01:21.321
He wanted me in hospice,
but now he can't seem

01:21.473 --> 01:24.399
to face what we both
know is ahead.

01:24.418 --> 01:27.920
This is very hard
for him, Conrad.

01:28.089 --> 01:30.255
Well, of course it is.
He loves you. (chuckles)

01:30.482 --> 01:32.332
And he has been in the business
of saving people

01:32.426 --> 01:34.484
for a long time.

01:34.503 --> 01:36.244
I'm a realist.

01:36.263 --> 01:38.746
I have one clear goal.

01:38.766 --> 01:42.935
I want all the time I have left
to spend with him.

01:43.086 --> 01:45.345
And no pain. That's all.

01:45.514 --> 01:49.775
But he can't seem
to stop trying to fix

01:49.926 --> 01:52.361
what can't be fixed.

01:53.172 --> 01:55.364
I'll talk to him.

01:56.117 --> 01:57.507
Good news, Dr. Devi.

01:57.601 --> 01:59.843
Your body's responding well
to the hormones.

01:59.862 --> 02:01.603
Your follicles
are maturing well.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.771
We should be able to retrieve
the eggs within the week.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.457
I can't believe
this is all happening.

02:05.534 --> 02:07.793
We hope.
But a first-time course of IVF

02:08.020 --> 02:11.371
-only has a 33% success rate.
-Dr. Devi is correct.

02:11.448 --> 02:13.448
It's important to manage
your expectations, Padma.

02:13.467 --> 02:16.117
The path to motherhood
is not always an easy one.

02:16.211 --> 02:17.694
I know, I know. I just...
(exhales)

02:17.787 --> 02:20.364
-I want this baby so badly.
-It's all I want for you, too.

02:20.382 --> 02:21.974
Once we have the eggs
from Dr. Devi,

02:22.125 --> 02:23.425
we can fertilize them and choose

02:23.535 --> 02:25.310
the viable embryo
to be implanted into you.

02:25.479 --> 02:27.312
Uh, one last question:
will your donor sperm arrive

02:27.481 --> 02:30.207
-in a test tube or...
-Oh, no, no, my donor's here,
in the hospital.

02:30.300 --> 02:32.818
-He's a, he's a doctor.
-Great.

02:32.969 --> 02:34.319
And he is available to come in
during the egg retrieval

02:34.471 --> 02:36.897
so we can create embryos
as quickly as possible?

02:37.049 --> 02:39.324
I hope.
He has a personal situation

02:39.476 --> 02:41.401
which makes it
a bit complicated.

02:41.553 --> 02:44.070
Yeah, if he's, um, unavailable
due to a family emergency,

02:44.165 --> 02:46.314
can we... can we wait?

02:46.408 --> 02:48.074
I'm afraid not.
In that instance,

02:48.227 --> 02:50.419
we would have to freeze
the eggs.

02:56.585 --> 02:57.992
What's wrong?

02:58.086 --> 03:01.180
I haven't been able to reach
AJ yet to finalize details.

03:01.256 --> 03:04.057
-What details?
-Just little things.

03:06.762 --> 03:07.911
You're blinking.

03:07.930 --> 03:09.521
Too many blinks.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.356
Come on, that's your tell. Talk.

03:11.508 --> 03:14.401
AJ hasn't fully committed
to be the sperm donor yet.

03:16.012 --> 03:17.529
We just lied to Dr. Johnson?

03:17.756 --> 03:20.515
Okay, calm down.
She's a doctor, not a<i> pujari.</i>

03:20.534 --> 03:23.368
Have a little faith.
The universe...

03:23.595 --> 03:25.353
-has a way of working
things out.
-No.

03:25.372 --> 03:26.446
You need to work this out.

03:26.598 --> 03:28.615
The universe is not
paying attention.

03:28.767 --> 03:30.858
Talk to Dr. Austin today.

03:31.027 --> 03:34.454
Okay? If he's not all in,
you need to know.

03:34.531 --> 03:36.465
You're so bossy.

03:37.443 --> 03:39.426
Okay.

03:40.370 --> 03:41.678
Okay.

03:47.228 --> 03:48.710
Hey.

03:48.729 --> 03:51.546
My mother is taking
escalating doses of morphine,

03:51.565 --> 03:53.381
and we don't even know
her kidney function.

03:53.517 --> 03:55.550
You think maybe I should
switch to hydromorphone?

03:55.569 --> 03:57.402
Uh, that depends.

03:57.554 --> 04:01.314
Are you worried about
long-term complications

04:01.467 --> 04:03.575
or focused on keeping her
comfortable for now?

04:03.802 --> 04:06.486
I-I don't think there's
any harm in running labs

04:06.638 --> 04:07.729
to check her kidney function.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.322
Well, there's no harm,
but I think the key

04:09.475 --> 04:11.583
is to ask yourself,
is there any benefit?

04:11.693 --> 04:15.337
Will this bring her
more comfort or less?

04:16.482 --> 04:19.841
Look, I-I know there's no fix.

04:20.744 --> 04:22.427
I-I know where this is going,

04:22.654 --> 04:24.746
I just want to spend as much
time with my mother as I can.

04:24.840 --> 04:26.581
There's nothing wrong
with that, man.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.935
Of course not, but your mom
is worried about you.

04:30.162 --> 04:32.938
More than anything else.

04:33.165 --> 04:35.482
She's worried about
how you're taking this.

04:37.169 --> 04:38.760
She told you that?

04:38.779 --> 04:39.945
(glass shatters)

04:40.172 --> 04:41.947
What was that? Mom!

04:42.174 --> 04:44.674
Oh, she's seizing.

04:44.693 --> 04:47.602
Let's get her on her side.

04:47.679 --> 04:49.604
-Hospice left you
lorazepam, right?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.290
It's in the, uh,
it's in the medicine cabinet.

04:51.517 --> 04:53.125
Okay.

04:53.352 --> 04:55.752
Hey, Mom,
you're gonna be all right.

04:57.447 --> 05:00.357
So, tell me what happened
on your camping trip.

05:00.375 --> 05:02.301
I was heading to the river
for a morning dip

05:02.528 --> 05:05.045
when I caught
my big toe on a root.

05:05.197 --> 05:06.880
I felt a pop in my ankle
and I went down.

05:06.974 --> 05:09.641
-And you were barefoot?
-BRYCE: Bare everything.

05:09.793 --> 05:11.568
-Oh.
-BRYCE: We're not nudists.

05:11.703 --> 05:12.869
We were earthing.

05:12.888 --> 05:14.962
Reconnecting to Earth's
electromagnetic field

05:14.982 --> 05:16.206
through bare skin.

05:16.299 --> 05:20.569
Sounds silly, but it works.

05:22.230 --> 05:24.214
101.2.

05:24.307 --> 05:25.324
Patient is spiking a fever.

05:25.475 --> 05:27.809
That can't be from his ankle.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.569
BP is 83/50.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.663
-Um, okay, uh...
-And dropping.

05:31.832 --> 05:34.458
-Uh, it's...
-Dr. Pravesh?

05:35.151 --> 05:36.226
What's the problem?

05:36.244 --> 05:38.061
BP is dropping rapidly.

05:38.080 --> 05:41.214
Dr. Pravesh is here
to take a closer look.

05:42.067 --> 05:44.158
Do you hear that ringing?

05:44.178 --> 05:46.069
-He's going down.
-One liter of LR

05:46.088 --> 05:48.438
and get that norepi pump
next to his bedside.

05:48.498 --> 05:49.681
Let's go.

05:50.500 --> 05:52.684
♪ ♪

06:03.680 --> 06:06.773
I think it's best
to call the hospice nurse.

06:06.925 --> 06:09.593
Have her come back
and take over.

06:09.595 --> 06:12.353
Yeah, but what if
it's a brain bleed?

06:12.373 --> 06:14.355
We know the cancer has spread
to her brain,

06:14.375 --> 06:16.282
so then that wouldn't
be unexpected.

06:16.435 --> 06:18.210
She could be hyponatremic.

06:18.437 --> 06:20.437
She hasn't been taking in
enough electrolytes.

06:20.530 --> 06:22.288
-AJ...
-No, if there's any chance

06:22.441 --> 06:26.276
I can get her a few extra weeks,
a few extra days,

06:26.369 --> 06:28.278
even a few extra hours...

06:28.371 --> 06:30.872
Any intervention now
could cause harm.

06:30.966 --> 06:32.682
Well, I got to try.

06:49.743 --> 06:52.393
As an investigator
for the state medical board,

06:52.487 --> 06:56.063
my job is to weigh
the merits of the case.

06:56.158 --> 06:57.490
And this case is clear.

06:57.584 --> 07:01.953
Emily Benesch was irreparably
injured by Dr. Bosley.

07:02.105 --> 07:06.258
When I reviewed common outcomes
for the surgery in question--

07:06.485 --> 07:08.427
spinal, neurological,
high risk--

07:08.578 --> 07:11.596
it appears Miss Benesch's
outcome is...

07:11.823 --> 07:12.989
is not at all unusual.

07:13.008 --> 07:16.417
Paralysis is not unusual?

07:16.437 --> 07:19.663
I mean, surely you know
how ludicrous that sounds.

07:19.681 --> 07:23.683
(laughs softly)
Did you even speak with Emily?

07:23.835 --> 07:26.352
The goal of my investigation
is to remain impartial

07:26.488 --> 07:27.837
and unbiased.

07:27.856 --> 07:29.856
Right, well, you only took
statements from experts

07:30.025 --> 07:32.033
provided by the defendant.

07:33.528 --> 07:37.180
You've become emotionally
involved in this case, Dr. Bell.

07:37.199 --> 07:38.623
It's blinding you to the reality

07:38.775 --> 07:41.609
that what happened
to this patient, while tragic,

07:41.703 --> 07:44.204
is not the fault of her surgeon.

07:44.356 --> 07:46.447
This case is closed.

07:46.541 --> 07:48.525
(door opens, closes)

07:48.543 --> 07:50.785
Bryce came in here with
a pulled tendon in his ankle,

07:50.879 --> 07:54.531
and has developed fevers,
hypotension requiring pressors

07:54.700 --> 07:56.382
and increasing agitation.

07:56.535 --> 07:57.809
The broad-spectrum antibiotics

07:58.036 --> 07:59.703
haven't really helped
with what's going on.

07:59.705 --> 08:01.554
This muscle spasm happened
in the past hour,

08:01.707 --> 08:04.131
so I checked his electrolytes,
and they're all in normal range.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.375
His-his thyroid is normal, too.

08:05.393 --> 08:07.210
CONRAD:
Have you been doing

08:07.229 --> 08:09.212
any intense exercising lately?

08:09.305 --> 08:11.323
I meditate, go for walks.

08:11.550 --> 08:13.049
We've been working
through the<i> Kama Sutra.</i>

08:13.068 --> 08:16.578
Sounds like quite a regimen.
(laughs softly)

08:20.984 --> 08:22.984
Percussive myoedema.

08:23.003 --> 08:27.063
Touch your chin
to your chest for me?

08:27.082 --> 08:28.840
The stiff neck is new.

08:29.067 --> 08:30.750
Bryce, we're gonna
run some tests

08:30.827 --> 08:33.678
to check for an infection
in your central nervous system.

08:33.830 --> 08:37.015
And we're gonna start
with a lumbar puncture, okay?

08:37.166 --> 08:39.425
CONRAD:
There you go. Breathe.

08:39.578 --> 08:42.003
Good, good.

08:42.097 --> 08:43.838
Just breathe.

08:43.932 --> 08:45.398
(ragged inhale)

08:46.026 --> 08:47.417
There you go.

08:47.435 --> 08:50.570
-I almost got it.
-CONRAD: Breathe.

08:52.107 --> 08:53.439
I brought kale and apple.

08:53.592 --> 08:55.759
Oh, my God.
What are you doing to him?

08:55.777 --> 08:57.761
I'm needle-phobic.
I can't watch.

08:57.779 --> 09:00.038
-Here.
-No, get that away from...

09:00.189 --> 09:02.040
MIA:
(exhales) I feel sick.

09:02.191 --> 09:03.600
He really doesn't
like that drink.

09:03.618 --> 09:06.169
It's triggering
a physical reaction.

09:08.549 --> 09:11.107
He's afraid of it.

09:11.126 --> 09:13.093
DEVON:
Hydrophobia.

09:15.614 --> 09:18.431
Bryce, we have
to test you for rabies.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.471
-(crying)
-Just one second, love.

09:25.566 --> 09:27.566
-I got you.
-(moans)

09:27.642 --> 09:29.568
I got you, I got you.

09:29.644 --> 09:32.237
I know, I know. I got you.

09:32.388 --> 09:35.448
Just a little bit.
Just a little bit.

09:37.077 --> 09:40.328
-Mm.
-It's okay.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.991
AUSTIN:
She's not getting
enough calories.

10:02.010 --> 10:05.252
I've tried five other flavors
and she wouldn't touch them.

10:05.272 --> 10:08.848
But this one,
chocolate raspberry chia,

10:08.942 --> 10:10.424
I think this is the one.

10:10.518 --> 10:12.093
Uh, you might want
to stick it in the freezer.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.170
She just fell asleep.

10:14.189 --> 10:15.839
She could be tired
from the pain meds.

10:15.857 --> 10:19.692
And I know that also
affects appetite.

10:19.861 --> 10:25.014
Or her body is requiring
less energy.

10:25.033 --> 10:26.683
Less input, less output

10:26.701 --> 10:30.045
as she begins to enter
a hibernation state.

10:31.465 --> 10:34.966
Dr. Austin, I'm not just here
for your mother.

10:35.193 --> 10:37.118
I'm here for you, too.

10:37.137 --> 10:40.013
So, if you have any questions...

10:42.792 --> 10:46.961
How much longer does she have?

10:47.130 --> 10:50.982
Could be a week, or a few days.

10:51.134 --> 10:53.559
Her metabolic functions
will be telling.

10:53.712 --> 10:56.212
But she'll also
give us signs as well.

10:56.231 --> 10:58.731
She may want
to open up and start

10:58.825 --> 11:01.567
to talk about things
she's never discussed before.

11:01.662 --> 11:03.553
She may get a burst of energy.

11:03.646 --> 11:06.906
We call that "planes,
trains and automobiles."

11:07.058 --> 11:10.910
If your mom starts
making plans for a trip,

11:11.062 --> 11:13.713
that usually means
she's ready to go.

11:15.901 --> 11:17.592
I don't know how you do it.

11:19.513 --> 11:22.514
You know, your job
seems incredibly hard.

11:22.665 --> 11:26.834
(laughs softly)
And being a surgeon is easy?

11:26.928 --> 11:30.580
I can solve problems
with a scalpel.

11:30.598 --> 11:34.609
You know, I can find a cure.
There's always an answer.

11:36.179 --> 11:39.422
But waiting for death to come

11:39.441 --> 11:44.093
a-and not trying to do
anything to stop it, I don't...

11:44.187 --> 11:46.446
I don't know how to do that.

11:46.598 --> 11:52.127
All you have to do
is follow your mother's lead.

12:04.725 --> 12:06.224
CONRAD:
He's positive.

12:06.451 --> 12:08.375
-Bryce has rabies.
-Rabies?

12:08.395 --> 12:09.802
But that's so impossibly rare.

12:09.896 --> 12:13.047
The odds of a doctor seeing
a rabies patient over the course

12:13.066 --> 12:15.900
of their career is one
in 325 million.

12:16.052 --> 12:17.402
O-Okay, we know
the rabies virus spreads

12:17.553 --> 12:19.312
to the brain
through the nerve cells,

12:19.464 --> 12:21.573
-and once it's there...
-It multiplies rapidly,

12:21.724 --> 12:24.409
causing severe inflammation
in the brain and the spine.

12:24.636 --> 12:27.987
It's 99.9% fatal if it's not
treated almost immediately.

12:28.139 --> 12:30.490
Only 11 patients
have survived.

12:30.642 --> 12:33.234
Clearly the odds
aren't in Bryce's favor,

12:33.253 --> 12:35.328
but people have been
saved before.

12:35.480 --> 12:38.831
So, now it's all about
when Bryce contracted the virus.

12:38.984 --> 12:40.984
Uh...

12:41.002 --> 12:43.077
-What?
-During intake,

12:43.171 --> 12:44.988
he told me that he went camping.

12:45.006 --> 12:46.839
Naked. No tent, no sleeping bag.

12:46.933 --> 12:49.826
It's some kind
of an Earth-love thing.

12:50.678 --> 12:54.013
He could've been bitten
by a bat and never noticed.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.440
I wish you told us this sooner.

12:55.667 --> 12:57.667
I didn't think--

12:57.685 --> 13:00.278
I'm sorry, I screwed up.

13:00.429 --> 13:02.429
CONRAD:
Let's find the bite.

13:02.524 --> 13:04.598
The further away
from the central nervous system,

13:04.692 --> 13:08.177
the longer it takes the virus
to reach the brain, okay?

13:08.271 --> 13:10.622
Every second counts.

13:16.112 --> 13:17.870
(footsteps approaching)

13:18.023 --> 13:19.964
Why is he being tied up?

13:20.191 --> 13:21.282
Bryce never hurt anyone.

13:21.376 --> 13:23.301
You're making him
feel claustrophobic.

13:23.452 --> 13:24.710
CONRAD:
I know it's hard
to see him like this,

13:24.863 --> 13:26.453
but rabies can cause aggression.

13:26.548 --> 13:28.807
It's safer for everyone,
including Bryce.

13:29.034 --> 13:30.867
DEVON:
We're gonna give him lorazepam

13:30.885 --> 13:32.535
-to relax him, okay?
-Bryce, we're looking
for a bite.

13:32.628 --> 13:35.313
It may be so small,
like a scratch,

13:35.540 --> 13:36.889
something you wouldn't
have even noticed.

13:36.983 --> 13:39.317
I don't know. I don't know, I...

13:39.468 --> 13:41.394
Bryce, tell me,
how do you sleep?

13:41.488 --> 13:43.379
What do you mean?
With my eyes closed.

13:43.398 --> 13:44.823
CONRAD:
He means back, side,

13:44.974 --> 13:46.065
-stomach?
-Side.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.660
-Okay.
-Let's go.

13:51.665 --> 13:53.072
DEVON:
All right, here.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.523
There's some puncture marks.

13:54.576 --> 13:57.410
We need to get as much HRIG
as possible

13:57.562 --> 13:59.820
into this infected area
beneath the bite.

13:59.840 --> 14:02.173
Bryce, we're gonna give you
a series of injections.

14:02.325 --> 14:04.233
A vaccine
and some immunoglobulins.

14:04.327 --> 14:05.735
We're gonna repeat them
every 12 hours.

14:05.753 --> 14:07.904
You're gonna get pretty sore.

14:07.997 --> 14:09.330
Those needles are huge.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.740
And if he's already sick,

14:10.833 --> 14:13.334
-then why are you
giving him a vaccine?
-Janice.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.501
We're trying to stop the virus

14:14.596 --> 14:16.337
from spreading
to his nervous system.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.504
If we can slow
the progress of the virus,

14:17.599 --> 14:19.023
then we have a chance
at treating him.

14:19.209 --> 14:22.360
That'll work? You'll cure him?

14:23.029 --> 14:24.437
If he got here in time.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.030
(Bryce shouts)

14:26.941 --> 14:28.199
MIA:
Oh, God.

14:28.351 --> 14:30.610
No, I-I... I can't...

14:30.704 --> 14:32.370
I can't handle this. I...

14:32.597 --> 14:35.665
I can't watch him
get worse and worse.

14:36.768 --> 14:37.858
(shouts)

14:37.936 --> 14:39.419
(gasps) Oh, my God.

14:49.614 --> 14:51.180
The board lied.

14:52.726 --> 14:54.392
Promised the patient
a fair investigation.

14:54.543 --> 14:57.803
Instead, case closed,
no further review.

14:57.898 --> 14:59.213
Unbelievable.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.457
So I did more
investigating myself.

15:01.459 --> 15:04.326
And the names of the same
five doctors, including Bosley,

15:04.328 --> 15:05.645
come up again and again.

15:05.739 --> 15:07.797
These are career bad apples
with multiple complaints

15:07.815 --> 15:08.981
of the worst kind.

15:09.075 --> 15:11.058
You remember that surgeon
they called Dr. Death?

15:11.077 --> 15:14.078
Of course. He maimed
and killed patients in Texas.

15:14.230 --> 15:16.748
His colleagues knew it.
They took it to the state board

15:16.899 --> 15:18.491
and the state board did nothing.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.326
But he got caught.

15:20.478 --> 15:23.421
When someone leaked
the story to the press.

15:32.081 --> 15:34.248
There you are.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.250
I've been texting you nonstop.

15:36.327 --> 15:39.679
I know.
I got your 5,000 messages.

15:39.773 --> 15:41.922
Don't worry, I didn't call AJ.

15:42.016 --> 15:45.259
-I heard about his mom and
I'm respecting their privacy.
-Good.

15:45.278 --> 15:50.173
Okay, so... next steps?

15:50.191 --> 15:52.766
We call Dr. Johnson and we tell
her we're freezing the eggs.

15:52.844 --> 15:56.103
I'm not willing to give up
on this cycle of IVF just yet.

15:56.122 --> 15:58.122
It's not giving up.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.940
A lot of people
freeze their eggs.

15:59.960 --> 16:01.200
They do it because the timing

16:01.352 --> 16:02.609
of making a baby
is just not right.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.796
Last week, I went
to the farmers' market

16:04.947 --> 16:06.447
and I got bagels.

16:06.466 --> 16:09.467
Okay? They were fresh
out of the oven, perfect.

16:09.636 --> 16:12.286
But I didn't think I'd be able
to eat them all in time

16:12.305 --> 16:14.806
before they went stale,
so I froze them.

16:15.033 --> 16:16.975
And guess what happened
the next day?

16:17.160 --> 16:19.602
You microwaved one and ate it?

16:21.147 --> 16:22.796
It wasn't the same.

16:22.890 --> 16:25.041
(laughs)
Padma,

16:25.059 --> 16:26.633
that is a ridiculous metaphor,

16:26.653 --> 16:29.320
and you cannot expect a donor
to just fall into your lap.

16:29.489 --> 16:32.398
It is really hard for me to talk
to you when you get like this.

16:32.550 --> 16:36.068
-Get like what?
-Overly Logical Leela.

16:36.162 --> 16:39.622
Trust the universe. No freezing.

16:43.077 --> 16:43.984
(alarm ringing)

16:44.078 --> 16:45.986
He snapped the restraint.

16:46.155 --> 16:49.749
Push two of lorazepam
and five of haloperidol.

16:49.901 --> 16:51.901
On it.

16:52.070 --> 16:53.919
We're treating him too late,
aren't we?

16:54.072 --> 16:55.680
I hope not.

16:55.907 --> 16:58.424
This virus
is a terrible way to die.

16:58.576 --> 17:01.602
(Bryce grunting)

17:11.698 --> 17:13.406
(birds chirping)

17:19.021 --> 17:21.706
Hey. What are you doing
on your feet?

17:22.691 --> 17:26.419
Dust inflames my sinuses.

17:30.108 --> 17:31.607
I thought I told you last night.

17:31.700 --> 17:34.034
You need a haircut.

17:34.128 --> 17:36.295
Well, you also called me Dad,

17:36.447 --> 17:38.539
so I figured
I would let it ride.

17:38.558 --> 17:42.560
And come on, you really should
get back in bed, Mom, come on.

17:44.064 --> 17:46.046
Okay? Come on.

17:46.066 --> 17:50.551
Janaya said your peach tree
was blooming.

17:50.645 --> 17:52.311
I'd like to see it.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.221
Okay.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.132
We'll get you in the wheelchair

17:56.150 --> 17:58.818
and we'll move you
to the window.

17:58.894 --> 18:01.137
No, son.

18:01.306 --> 18:04.640
Hear my words. I feel good.

18:04.733 --> 18:07.001
I want to go outside.

18:08.830 --> 18:09.736
Okay.

18:09.756 --> 18:12.998
We'll make it a field trip.

18:13.093 --> 18:15.426
-(laughs)
-All right, let's do it.

18:20.675 --> 18:22.249
So far, I've identified

18:22.268 --> 18:24.510
two major hurdles
in rabies protocols.

18:24.662 --> 18:27.588
We have antiviral effectiveness
and neuroprotection.

18:27.756 --> 18:29.423
So once the virus enters

18:29.442 --> 18:31.834
his spinal cord or the brain,
the antivirals are ineffective.

18:31.927 --> 18:34.261
The meds can't pass through
the blood-brain barrier.

18:34.430 --> 18:36.948
-Patient dies.
-So, what if we made

18:37.175 --> 18:39.784
-the barrier more porous?
-How?

18:40.011 --> 18:43.270
Something I learned
in clinical trials.

18:43.364 --> 18:45.514
Some brain cancer studies
show that mannitol

18:45.533 --> 18:47.774
can actually poke holes
in the barrier

18:47.869 --> 18:50.444
-so that the chemo can get in.
-Yeah, poke enough holes

18:50.463 --> 18:54.590
in the blood-brain barrier and
the antivirals can seep through.

18:55.969 --> 18:57.860
(exhales)
That's an incredible long shot.

18:57.953 --> 18:59.378
And it doesn't explain
how we preserve

18:59.472 --> 19:02.031
the nervous system
long enough for it to work.

19:02.049 --> 19:04.124
So we need to figure out
a way to cool him down

19:04.218 --> 19:05.868
without heavy sedation.

19:05.887 --> 19:07.628
What if we lower his temperature
from the inside out?

19:07.647 --> 19:11.223
We place an IV cooling probe
in a blood vessel.

19:11.376 --> 19:12.892
Warm him from the outside

19:12.968 --> 19:14.318
with blankets
and meds for shivering.

19:14.470 --> 19:16.487
So we take
the existing rabies protocol

19:16.714 --> 19:19.615
and tweak it just a bit.
I mean, it could work.

19:21.068 --> 19:24.311
(exhales) I mean,
it has never been done before.

19:24.330 --> 19:26.313
This is completely hypothetical.

19:26.332 --> 19:27.556
And the minute Bryce was bitten,

19:27.575 --> 19:30.576
hypothetical became
his only chance.

19:30.670 --> 19:33.654
-Thanks for coming.
-Flattered you remembered me.

19:34.899 --> 19:39.385
(chuckles): You wrote
that "Dr. Reality Star" piece.

19:41.072 --> 19:42.680
I framed it.

19:44.409 --> 19:46.409
That's kind of you,
since it was, uh,

19:46.502 --> 19:49.245
shall we say,
a balanced profile?

19:49.263 --> 19:51.263
Well, I appreciated
your honesty.

19:51.432 --> 19:54.266
-That's why I called you.
-Look, we've sniffed around

19:54.435 --> 19:56.510
the medical board's incompetence
many times before,

19:56.529 --> 19:59.922
but without any proof,
we never get anywhere.

20:00.015 --> 20:02.700
I have case files.

20:04.871 --> 20:08.522
And patients that all
are willing to talk.

20:08.616 --> 20:10.190
And I thought if you published
their stories...

20:10.284 --> 20:12.192
The board is appointed
by the governor,

20:12.286 --> 20:13.769
approved by the state senate.

20:13.862 --> 20:15.271
You understand that,
by doing this,

20:15.289 --> 20:16.196
you'll be rocking
a very big boat.

20:16.290 --> 20:18.441
Oh, yeah, it's an ocean liner.

20:18.459 --> 20:21.034
You know, all doctors
benefit from the shield

20:21.128 --> 20:22.869
the white coat provides.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.388
And I have, too.

20:25.950 --> 20:28.284
Malpractice breaks
our oath to do no harm,

20:28.302 --> 20:31.454
but it also destroys the public
trust in even the best doctors.

20:31.547 --> 20:34.065
And the-the bad ones are few.

20:35.793 --> 20:37.476
But they need to be weeded out.

20:37.628 --> 20:39.737
And the guard dogs
need to be reminded

20:39.888 --> 20:41.697
of who they're meant to protect.

20:47.154 --> 20:48.704
You mind if I record this?

20:49.582 --> 20:51.999
I'm counting on it.

20:55.830 --> 20:57.904
Heavenly.

20:57.924 --> 21:01.484
You have a green thumb.

21:01.502 --> 21:04.262
Well, I have
a well-paid landscaper.

21:04.489 --> 21:06.555
(Carol laughs)

21:09.677 --> 21:15.106
You've got your career,
your beautiful home,

21:15.333 --> 21:20.695
your well-paid landscaper.
(laughs)

21:21.689 --> 21:23.430
Is that all you need?

21:23.449 --> 21:26.358
Well, if-if you're inquiring
about my dating life,

21:26.511 --> 21:29.770
I-I assure you,
it's-it's quite robust.

21:29.864 --> 21:32.290
Dating is fine.

21:32.441 --> 21:37.044
But you have to open
yourself up to love.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.873
What about a family?

21:41.025 --> 21:43.542
-Bah.
-(groans)

21:43.636 --> 21:45.720
(laughs)

21:47.865 --> 21:49.715
Don't you worry about me, Mom.

21:49.809 --> 21:53.035
-Mm.
-I'm gonna be okay.

21:53.054 --> 21:57.297
I want you to be more than okay.

21:57.317 --> 21:58.983
(coughs)

22:01.712 --> 22:04.396
You know what we need?

22:04.490 --> 22:08.901
A trip to Butter Bean Beach
in Savannah.

22:09.053 --> 22:12.388
We haven't been in so long.

22:12.390 --> 22:14.314
Yeah, I don't think
we can manage that, Mom.

Dr. Bonner is gonna
sit with you,

23:34.414 --> 23:36.747

<i>-And it is full of deep pockets.</i>
-EMILY: Finally!

37:33.827 --> 37:37.328
<i> The medical industrial complex</i>
<i> gives more money</i>

37:37.481 --> 37:40.090
<i> than any other single donor,</i>
<i> including the NRA.</i>

37:40.241 --> 37:42.241
<i> It just has to stop.</i>

37:42.335 --> 37:45.077
<i> I understand only 2%</i>
<i> of all malpractice cases</i>

37:45.097 --> 37:46.838
<i> are ever reviewed</i>
<i> by the State Medical Board.</i>

37:46.932 --> 37:48.673
<i> Break down for us,</i>
<i> if you will,</i>

37:48.825 --> 37:50.767
<i> how everyday citizens are</i>
<i> supposed to get the attention</i>

37:50.994 --> 37:53.828
<i> -of the Board.</i>
<i> -Well, that's at the very</i>
<i> heart of this, isn't it?</i>

37:53.921 --> 37:57.941
<i> Because most people don't know</i>
<i> that the State Medical Board</i>

37:58.168 --> 38:01.019
<i> is there to protect patients.</i>

38:01.171 --> 38:02.520
<i> KIMBERLY:</i>
<i> Who knew?</i>

38:02.597 --> 38:04.614
He just called out
the whole Medical Board.

38:04.691 --> 38:08.526
He just called out
the freaking governor.

38:08.678 --> 38:11.121
That's my man.

38:15.794 --> 38:17.519
You're tracking much better,
Bryce.

38:17.537 --> 38:19.963
And you have some
intentional movement

38:20.114 --> 38:21.856
in all four of your limbs.

38:21.875 --> 38:24.116
And it may not seem
like it yet,

38:24.169 --> 38:26.044
but that is monumental.

38:26.196 --> 38:28.621
The virus did a number
on your nervous system,

38:28.640 --> 38:31.957
but you just beat one of
the most fatal diseases

38:32.035 --> 38:34.477
-on the planet, man.
-DEVON: Yes, you did.

38:34.629 --> 38:37.129
And you're a young guy
with a young brain

38:37.223 --> 38:39.374
with the ability
to rewire itself.

38:39.467 --> 38:41.225
I spoke to the rehab facility.

38:41.378 --> 38:43.211
They're gonna roll out
the red carpet for you, Bryce.

38:43.304 --> 38:46.448
You're a medical celebrity.

38:51.312 --> 38:52.829
You know, people are saying
you ought to have

38:52.998 --> 38:55.314
a whole wing dedicated
to this success story.

38:55.392 --> 38:59.243
The Hawkins-Pravesh Rabies
Treatment Facility.

38:59.396 --> 39:01.654
You mean the Pravesh-Hawkins
Facility.

39:01.748 --> 39:03.231
Ha-ha, I like hers better.

39:03.249 --> 39:06.509
But honestly, if I never see
another rabies patient again

39:06.736 --> 39:08.511
it'll be too soon.

39:09.997 --> 39:12.098
Excuse me a sec, guys.

39:13.927 --> 39:16.836
Congratulations.
I'm so proud of you.

39:16.930 --> 39:20.440
It was a team effort.

39:22.009 --> 39:23.485
So, uh...

39:26.089 --> 39:29.181
-...are things weird between us?
-Not weird.

39:29.201 --> 39:30.683
And we don't even
have to discuss it

39:30.702 --> 39:33.078
because Padma agreed
to freezing the eggs.

39:34.764 --> 39:37.432
Oh. I thought you said

39:37.450 --> 39:40.627
her biological clock
was ticking.

39:42.381 --> 39:44.105
What can I say?

39:44.124 --> 39:45.757
She hit snooze.

39:47.034 --> 39:48.793
You know my sister.

39:48.945 --> 39:50.428
Hmm.

39:52.724 --> 39:55.967
Devon, did you really want
to father my sister's child?

39:56.061 --> 39:57.952
No, I-I...

39:57.971 --> 40:00.638
I don't know, I just...

40:00.732 --> 40:05.026
I don't know, I just want
to help in any way I can.

40:08.222 --> 40:09.981
I have to get to surgery.

40:10.075 --> 40:12.534
Congrats again on your patient.

-Italian. Gigi's favorite.

40:27.592 --> 40:29.909
And she insisted
it was your favorite, too.

40:29.928 --> 40:32.244
Of course. Come on in.

40:32.264 --> 40:34.747
-Hey.
-This is for you, Dr. Austin.

40:34.766 --> 40:36.582
I'm sorry about your mommy.

40:36.601 --> 40:38.268
Oh, thank you, Double-G.

40:38.495 --> 40:40.419
Oh, I really appreciate it.

40:40.513 --> 40:42.981
All right, you guys
come on in.

40:46.503 --> 40:50.405
Oh, these flowers are

41:09.968 --> 41:11.859
I feel that.

41:11.878 --> 41:14.378
I'm not ready
to come back yet.

41:14.531 --> 41:16.047
You know, I...

41:16.199 --> 41:18.382
I'm used to checking on her.

41:18.535 --> 41:21.126
You know,
listening for her voice,

41:21.221 --> 41:23.037
for her every move.

41:23.056 --> 41:25.565
Now it's just silent.

41:27.227 --> 41:30.028
And I'm all alone.

41:31.898 --> 41:33.138
I could lend you Gigi.

-(AJ laughs)
-Daddy!

41:34.993 --> 41:37.142
Daddy needs a break.
I'll pick you up in

41:37.162 --> 41:38.328
say, what, about a week?

41:38.555 --> 41:41.664
What do you say,
Uncle AJ? Yeah?

41:50.250 --> 41:51.508
(Padma breathes deep,
exhales sharply)

41:51.735 --> 41:53.993
-Are you nervous?
-Why would I be nervous?

41:54.087 --> 41:55.178
Because it's hatch day.

41:55.347 --> 41:57.639
Time to find out
if you're a good chicken.

42:01.853 --> 42:03.002
Dr. Austin.

42:03.096 --> 42:05.246
I didn't expect
to see you here.

42:05.265 --> 42:08.599
I'm so sorry
about your mother.

42:08.676 --> 42:11.569
Me, too. How are you?

42:13.865 --> 42:16.348
Grieving.

42:16.368 --> 42:19.110
It's gonna take some time,
right?

42:19.262 --> 42:22.947
But it's time that a woman...

42:23.099 --> 42:26.117
<i> women</i> going through IVF

42:26.193 --> 42:28.711
cannot afford to waste.

42:30.382 --> 42:33.107
So, Padma,
if it's not too late,

42:33.126 --> 42:34.867
I would like to be
your sperm donor.

42:34.961 --> 42:37.111
(exhales sharply)

42:37.130 --> 42:40.114
And you didn't think
the universe would come through.

42:40.133 --> 42:43.434
Yes. Yes. Yes!

42:45.397 --> 42:47.689
AUSTIN:
But there is a condition.

42:51.795 --> 42:55.387
Now that I'm alone
in the world,

42:55.481 --> 42:57.982
I realize I-I don't like
being alone.

42:58.134 --> 43:00.301
So if we're going to do this,

43:00.320 --> 43:03.304
I don't want to just be
a donor.

43:03.397 --> 43:05.999
I've got to help you
raise this kid.

43:07.068 --> 43:10.461
I want to be a father.
