NARRATOR: <i>This chapter
was the reason</i>

01:25.276 --> 01:30.945
<i>we started looking into
this phenomenon...</i>

01:30.947 --> 01:35.018
<i>and to collect evidence
throughout history...</i>

01:39.956 --> 01:41.826
<i>the scriptures...</i>

01:48.565 --> 01:50.801
<i>and old paintings...</i>

01:57.408 --> 01:59.143
<i>archeology.</i>

02:01.979 --> 02:04.712
<i>There were signs everywhere,</i>

02:04.714 --> 02:07.849
<i>but no one really
saw it coming.</i>

02:07.851 --> 02:09.852
<i>These days...</i>

02:09.854 --> 02:13.791
<i>people can't see
when they are preaching hatred.</i>

02:15.493 --> 02:19.931
<i>People can't hear when the gods
are fighting each other.</i>

02:22.333 --> 02:26.434
<i>And eventually it all
comes down to this city,</i>

02:26.436 --> 02:31.839
<i>where there is so much hatred,
it runs deep into the ground,</i>

02:31.841 --> 02:34.244
<i>waking up the dead.</i>

02:35.780 --> 02:40.349
<i>In 1972,
two priests from Jerusalem</i>

02:40.351 --> 02:44.486
<i>managed to capture this event.</i>

02:44.488 --> 02:46.689
<i>It was the first
profound evidence.</i>

02:46.691 --> 02:53.865
[man speaking Hebrew]

03:11.348 --> 03:14.783
Three stars. That's when
the Yom Kippur just started.

03:14.785 --> 03:19.487
<i>The church got information
about a local family.</i>

03:19.489 --> 03:22.124
La familiae,
Jewish, Muslim?

03:22.126 --> 03:24.459
- Jewish.
- Jewish.

03:24.461 --> 03:26.828
- Are you filming this?
- It's very important.

03:26.830 --> 03:31.100
<i>They say it's a woman
and that she came back.</i>

03:31.102 --> 03:32.667
Excuse me, sir,

03:32.669 --> 03:35.970
can you tell the camera
exactly what happened?

03:35.972 --> 03:38.573
[speaking Hebrew]
That thing is not my wife.

03:38.575 --> 03:41.876
<i>She died of typhus
three days before</i>

03:41.878 --> 03:45.547
<i>and was buried near Golgotha.</i>

03:45.549 --> 03:47.148
<i>While they were mourning,</i>

03:47.150 --> 03:49.118
<i>on the third night
of the Shiva,</i>

03:49.120 --> 03:53.589
<i>the child heard
a knock on the door.</i>

03:53.591 --> 03:55.958
<i>At the beginning,
she was quiet and calm,</i>

03:55.960 --> 03:57.993
<i>but then she became violent.</i>

03:57.995 --> 04:00.462
She hurt my father.

04:00.464 --> 04:02.700
[shouting]

04:05.668 --> 04:09.571
Representatives from all three
religions are here.

04:09.573 --> 04:11.707
This concerns all of us.

04:11.709 --> 04:16.147
- [woman shrieking]
- [rabbis chanting]

04:18.014 --> 04:20.916
<i>They all believed
in different gods,</i>

04:20.918 --> 04:22.817
<i>but on that night,</i>

04:22.819 --> 04:27.622
<i>they were all dealing
with the same devil.</i>

04:27.624 --> 04:32.429
<i>For hours, they tried
to help her, cure her.</i>

04:39.537 --> 04:42.638
<i>But evil was too strong
in that woman.</i>

04:42.640 --> 04:44.540
Go closer, quickly.

04:44.542 --> 04:47.344
<i>They had no other choice.</i>

04:54.652 --> 04:56.684
[speaking Hebrew]

04:56.686 --> 04:59.890
[woman groaning]

05:01.491 --> 05:04.725
In the name of the Lord,
return to the ground!

05:04.727 --> 05:07.799
[shrieks]

05:11.669 --> 05:16.472
<i>They say there are
three gates to hell.</i>

05:16.474 --> 05:19.975
<i>On that night...</i>

05:19.977 --> 05:22.479
<i>we found one of them.</i>

05:37.027 --> 05:38.927
- SARAHL: Dad!
- DAD: Huh?

05:38.929 --> 05:41.830
I can't believe you.
Oh, my God, no way.

05:41.832 --> 05:43.965
- What do you think?
- You got me a smart glass?

05:43.967 --> 05:46.167
- Oh, my God.
- You like it?

05:46.169 --> 05:49.872
Dad, I can't believe you.
Wait.

05:49.874 --> 05:52.840
Look, I've already signed you in
with your user name.

05:52.842 --> 05:55.042
- Did I put it on right?
- You look great in them.

05:55.044 --> 05:57.980
- Oh, it's so cool!
- It is cool.

05:57.982 --> 05:59.780
Dad, you're unbelievable.

05:59.782 --> 06:01.549
This is the touchpad,

06:01.551 --> 06:04.585
and you navigate with
your finger like a mouse,

06:04.587 --> 06:07.756
and this is the memory card.

06:07.758 --> 06:10.092
I got you
your prescription glasses,

06:10.094 --> 06:12.694
so basically you're all set.

06:12.696 --> 06:13.998
[giggles]

06:15.265 --> 06:17.932
- It makes me look geeky, right?
- What do you expect?

06:17.934 --> 06:20.268
You play those video games
all day long.

06:20.270 --> 06:22.271
Dad, don't.
Thank you, Daddy.

06:22.273 --> 06:24.239
Why don't you try 'em out?

06:24.241 --> 06:26.275
Glass, play music.

06:26.277 --> 06:29.447
DAD: Don't be long, all right?

06:32.215 --> 06:36.985
<i>♪ No tomorrow
will get ready for me ♪</i>

06:36.987 --> 06:38.586
That's cool!

06:38.588 --> 06:42.658
<i>♪ Doesn't even know I'm here ♪</i>

06:42.660 --> 06:44.559
Dad, you're the best!

06:44.561 --> 06:49.932
<i>♪ Sitting staring in silence,
leering fear ♪</i>

06:49.934 --> 06:52.100
Glass, stop music.

06:52.102 --> 06:54.806
Okay. Glass, open menu.

06:57.107 --> 07:00.411
No. Okay, games.

07:04.614 --> 07:06.314
Zombies? Oh, yeah.

07:06.316 --> 07:07.648
Hey, guys.

07:07.650 --> 07:10.387
- [meows]
- Cool it, Dexter.

07:13.189 --> 07:14.922
Here we go.

07:14.924 --> 07:17.626
[laughs]
This is so cool.

07:17.628 --> 07:19.529
- [growls]
- Die!

07:23.032 --> 07:24.967
Come to mama.

07:24.969 --> 07:27.069
[chuckles]

07:27.071 --> 07:28.869
Yeah.

07:28.871 --> 07:32.139
Take that, asshole.

07:32.141 --> 07:33.944
Die, motherfucker.

07:35.011 --> 07:37.247

07:52.395 --> 07:54.228
<i>Well, how about Tel Aviv?</i>

07:54.230 --> 07:57.198
<i>The nightlife is not something
you see every day.</i>

07:57.200 --> 07:59.100
<i>The beach parties
and the nightclubs</i>

07:59.102 --> 08:01.403
<i>offer a pretty wild experience.</i>

08:01.405 --> 08:02.871
- <i>For a minute there...</i>
- DAD: Sarah!

08:02.873 --> 08:05.674
SARAH: I'm here.
Glass, close link.

08:05.676 --> 08:09.011
- You all packed?
- Yes, Daddy.

08:09.013 --> 08:12.648
I just want to say goodbye.

08:12.650 --> 08:15.684
DAD: We've got to go get Rachel,
so we better get going.

08:15.686 --> 08:17.285
SARAH: I'll be right up!

08:17.287 --> 08:19.522
DAD: Don't be long,
sweetheart, okay?

08:45.782 --> 08:50.121
[crying]

09:03.834 --> 09:06.867
DAD: Sarah? Are you coming?

09:06.869 --> 09:09.136
We've got to get going.

09:09.138 --> 09:11.241
I'm coming!

09:18.148 --> 09:20.881
DAD: I'm happy that Rachel
is taking you on this trip.

09:20.883 --> 09:23.385
You've had a rough year.

09:23.387 --> 09:28.155
- We all did.
- Yeah.

09:28.157 --> 09:29.891
DAD: Oh, here's Rachel.

09:29.893 --> 09:31.760
- Whoo!
- DAD: Hey, Rache.

09:31.762 --> 09:33.395
I can't believe it's happening!
We're really going.

09:33.397 --> 09:35.830
- Hi, Mr. Pullman.
- Are your parents home?

09:35.832 --> 09:38.433
No. They're off squandering
my inheritance somewhere.

09:38.435 --> 09:41.502
- Come on, Drake, the bag.
- SARAH: Come on, come on.

09:41.504 --> 09:43.137
- We're in a hurry.
- I'm on it, baby.

09:43.139 --> 09:45.006
SARAH: I thought it was over
between you two.

09:45.008 --> 09:46.341
DRAKE: Okay, baby.
You're all set.

09:46.343 --> 09:48.142
Oh, my God,
I'm going to miss you.

09:48.144 --> 09:50.312
Rache! Come on, guys,
cut it out.

09:50.314 --> 09:52.012
- Come on. Get into the car.
- I'm gonna miss you so much.

09:52.014 --> 09:53.515
Come on. Rache!

09:53.517 --> 09:55.382
- Bye, baby.
- Bye, sweetie.

09:55.384 --> 09:57.051
- Get in the car already.
- Bye, guys.

09:57.053 --> 09:58.520
- Bye, Sarah.
- Bye, Drake.

09:58.522 --> 10:00.921
Have fun, girls.
Keep it clean.

10:00.923 --> 10:02.958
I can't believe
we're really going!

10:02.960 --> 10:05.160
- Call me when you get there.
- We're going to Tel Aviv!

10:05.162 --> 10:07.896
- Bye!
- Bye, Drake, lousy lay.

10:07.898 --> 10:10.365
- I'm sorry, Mr. Pullman.
- [laughs]

10:10.367 --> 10:12.434
- You have fun.
- Thank you, Daddy.

10:12.436 --> 10:14.435
- I love you, kid.
- I love you.

10:14.437 --> 10:16.036
Oh, shit, it's almost 2:00.
We gotta go. Come on.

10:16.038 --> 10:17.338
We're gonna be late.
Bye, Mr. Pullman!

10:17.340 --> 10:19.040
- Bye, Daddy!
- Thanks for the ride!

10:19.042 --> 10:21.543
Sarah, don't forget
to send me some pictures!

10:21.545 --> 10:23.481
- Let's go!
- [laughing]

10:25.415 --> 10:27.149
I'm really happy
we're finally doing this.

10:27.151 --> 10:29.049
I think it will be
really good for you.

10:29.051 --> 10:31.521
- What's our seat number again?
- It's here. 15.

10:38.228 --> 10:43.365
- Mm-hm.
- Rache, how's he doing?

10:43.367 --> 10:47.434
- Rache.
- What?

10:47.436 --> 10:49.905
Okay, so, Sarah and Rachel.

10:49.907 --> 10:52.040
- Yes.
- Yeah.

10:52.042 --> 10:53.842
So, Kevin, where are you from?

10:53.844 --> 10:57.011
I'm from all over.
I travel a lot.

10:57.013 --> 10:59.180
So where have you been to?

10:59.182 --> 11:01.282
Well, I've lost count.

11:01.284 --> 11:03.584
You see, I study anthropology,

11:03.586 --> 11:07.322
so I really like traveling,
exploring different cultures,

11:07.324 --> 11:09.123
especially ancient ones.

11:09.125 --> 11:13.060
- Sounds fascinating.
- Wow. That sounds interesting.

11:13.062 --> 11:15.362
I guess that probably
sounds boring to you.

11:15.364 --> 11:16.931
No, no, no, no, really.

11:16.933 --> 11:19.534
It's actually sounds
really cool.

11:19.536 --> 11:22.437
So what are you,
some kind of Indiana Jones?

11:22.439 --> 11:25.272
Exactly,
only much better looking.

11:25.274 --> 11:27.007
[Sarah giggles]

11:27.009 --> 11:30.045
[snoring]

11:30.047 --> 11:32.347
KEVIN: That's exactly
what I'm saying.

11:32.349 --> 11:34.482
Every religion calls it
in a different name,

11:34.484 --> 11:37.251
but actually everyone's
talking about the same thing.

11:37.253 --> 11:38.553
SARAH: Cool.

11:38.555 --> 11:40.856
KEVIN: In Islam,
it's the Dark Angel.

11:40.858 --> 11:42.591
For Jews, it's Golem.

11:42.593 --> 11:47.529
And in Christianity, it's the
undead or zombies or whatever.

11:47.531 --> 11:49.231
SARAH: Whoa.

11:49.233 --> 11:51.232
[rumbling]

11:51.234 --> 11:53.300
Oh, God.
I hate these fuckers.

11:53.302 --> 11:54.572
What was that?

12:02.311 --> 12:05.981
RACHEL: Israel, here we come.

12:05.983 --> 12:07.818
SARAH: Glass, take a picture.

12:12.022 --> 12:14.792
- Here we go.
- Glass, what time is it?

12:15.993 --> 12:18.626
- Holy shit, it's hot.
- Whoa.

12:18.628 --> 12:21.463
- We got beach weather.
- Totally.

12:21.465 --> 12:23.365
- Ouch!
- Sorry.

12:23.367 --> 12:26.635
Listen, I've got an offer
you can't refuse.

12:26.637 --> 12:28.370
Offering to carry our bags
to Tel Aviv?

12:28.372 --> 12:29.570
That's so sweet of you,
Kevin.

12:29.572 --> 12:31.238
Take mine.

12:31.240 --> 12:34.442
It's a very special time
in the holy city.

12:34.444 --> 12:36.211
- Come with me to Jerusalem.
- Jerusalem?

12:36.213 --> 12:39.347
- It's gonna be fun.
- Yeah, Rache, what do you say?

12:39.349 --> 12:42.083
Will you excuse us for a second?
Just one second.

12:42.085 --> 12:43.617
Sarah, come here a second.

12:43.619 --> 12:46.021
What? What is it?

12:46.023 --> 12:47.588
Oh, my God,
you're such a slut.

12:47.590 --> 12:49.256
- What? Why?
- Why?

12:49.258 --> 12:52.961
Just admit you want
a taste of that ass.

12:52.963 --> 12:55.463
And that stupid hat.

12:55.465 --> 12:57.265
- Just admit it.
- Okay, fine.

12:57.267 --> 12:59.534
But come on, Rache,
we're just changing the order.

12:59.536 --> 13:02.203
First Jerusalem,
then parties in Tel Aviv, okay?

13:02.205 --> 13:06.507
The whole point of the trip
is to have fun, right?

13:06.509 --> 13:09.577
You just chew it?

13:09.579 --> 13:12.479
It's good.
Make you strong in the bed.

13:12.481 --> 13:14.716
- Take, take.
- SARAH: What is that?

13:14.718 --> 13:17.051
- I've gotta try this.
- Voice command. Call Dad.

13:17.053 --> 13:18.652
Kevin, I'm serious.
Don't eat that.

13:18.654 --> 13:21.055
- No, no! Shit.
- [line ringing]

13:21.057 --> 13:23.724
It's nice.
It's disgusting!

13:23.726 --> 13:25.359
- Nasty!
- It's bitter.

13:25.361 --> 13:27.062
Whatever, fine.

13:27.064 --> 13:28.530
<i>Hi, sweetie.</i>

13:28.532 --> 13:31.232
Oh, shit. Sorry, Dad.
I forgot it was nighttime.

13:31.234 --> 13:33.233
<i>No, it's okay.
I'm glad you called.</i>

13:33.235 --> 13:35.236
<i>Have you landed?
Are you in Tel Aviv?</i>

13:35.238 --> 13:37.005
Actually our plans
are kinda changed.

13:37.007 --> 13:38.573
We're heading
to Jerusalem now.

13:38.575 --> 13:40.507
<i>Is that okay?
Should I be worried?</i>

13:40.509 --> 13:42.176
- No.
- Hi, Mr. Pullman!

13:42.178 --> 13:43.211
- <i>Hi.</i>
- No, no, don't worry.

13:43.213 --> 13:44.445
Everything's fine.

13:44.447 --> 13:46.247
Kevin, does that make
your mouth burn?

13:46.249 --> 13:48.248
- My whole mouth is...
- Oh, my God, it's so gross.

13:48.250 --> 13:50.385
- It's disgusting.
- Close your mouth.

13:50.387 --> 13:54.488
This is so disgusting.

13:54.490 --> 13:57.391
This is a big big graveyard,
very old.

13:57.393 --> 14:01.029
- Got a lot of dead people here.
- A lot.

14:01.031 --> 14:04.498
This is the entrance
of the city. A graveyard.

- Yes, for people who go crazy.

39:05.266 --> 39:08.501
There's a lot here in the city
like this.

39:08.503 --> 39:10.570
A lot of tourists come here,

39:10.572 --> 39:12.271
they see their own eyes
what they read in the Bible,

39:12.273 --> 39:14.273
and they go cuckoo-ruckoo.

39:14.275 --> 39:16.543
KEVIN: You mean
Jerusalem Syndrome?

39:16.545 --> 39:20.579
Yes. This city can bring
a lot of madness for the people.

39:20.581 --> 39:21.780
Let's go.

39:21.782 --> 39:23.750
- [loud chatter]
- Sarah, look at me.

39:23.752 --> 39:25.820
Oh, wow.

39:27.221 --> 39:28.855
Pretty.

39:28.857 --> 39:30.991
"Don't Worry, Be Jewish."

39:30.993 --> 39:33.692
SARAH: I'm so getting that one
for my dad.

39:33.694 --> 39:34.960
See?

39:34.962 --> 39:36.262
What's that?

39:36.264 --> 39:37.898
OMAR: This is where we pray.

39:37.900 --> 39:40.803
SARAH: No way. That's amazing.

39:42.069 --> 39:45.170
They're all praying?
They always pray here.

39:45.172 --> 39:46.273
KEVIN: Nice dress.

39:46.275 --> 39:49.241
Yeah, very.

39:49.243 --> 39:51.878
I'm gonna check
how much it is.

39:51.880 --> 39:53.880
No. Kevin, stop.

39:53.882 --> 39:56.849
Don't worry. I got this.

39:56.851 --> 40:00.119
You Jews wear white
on Yom Kippur, right?

40:00.121 --> 40:02.855
Now you have
something to wear.

40:02.857 --> 40:04.793
Thanks, Indiana.

40:08.697 --> 40:11.598
- Rache!
- Is this real leather?

40:11.600 --> 40:13.333
- [bell tolling]
- Wow.

40:13.335 --> 40:14.900
Sarah, you're gonna get lost.
Come on.

40:14.902 --> 40:17.270
Okay, okay.

40:17.272 --> 40:21.544
- Smells like something.
- You smell perfect.

40:30.185 --> 40:33.186
Rache, I don't think you're
allowed to do that here.

40:33.188 --> 40:34.523
Put it in your bag.

40:35.857 --> 40:37.157
Western Wall.

40:37.159 --> 40:39.192
This is the holiest place
in Israel.

40:39.194 --> 40:41.927
- Better give it some respect.
- All right, all right.

40:41.929 --> 40:44.297
Rache, you know I don't believe
in that nonsense.

40:44.299 --> 40:46.099
Just give it a chance.

40:46.101 --> 40:50.139
Just write down your deepest
and strongest wishes, okay?

41:02.183 --> 41:04.284
All right. Here it is.

41:04.286 --> 41:08.054
Nothing special.
Just world peace.

41:08.056 --> 41:09.956
Hope we're good.

41:09.958 --> 41:11.858
- [squawking]
- Whoa.

41:11.860 --> 41:14.893
What the hell?

41:14.895 --> 41:17.332
- What the hell?
- What the fuck?

41:18.799 --> 41:22.637
That was creepy.
Let's get out of here.

41:24.306 --> 41:26.105
What is this place?

41:26.107 --> 41:27.940
Come on, let's go.
Come on, come on.

41:27.942 --> 41:32.212
GUIDE: Welcome to
King Solomon's Quarries,

41:32.214 --> 41:36.750
the biggest artificial cave
in the Middle East.

41:36.752 --> 41:38.851
- OMAR: Take helmet.
- GUIDE: Please, everybody,

41:38.853 --> 41:43.389
take a helmet
and turn on the headlights.

41:43.391 --> 41:46.125
You know that these are
the exact same flashlights

41:46.127 --> 41:50.764
that were used by King Solomon's
diggers a thousand years ago.

41:50.766 --> 41:54.067
[laughing]

41:54.069 --> 41:56.670
- GUIDE: Okay.
- SARAH: That wasn't funny.

41:56.672 --> 42:03.043
King Solomon was...
[mumbling]

42:03.045 --> 42:07.015
Bla bla bla.
Bla bla bla.

42:08.784 --> 42:11.817
- Boo!
- Rache! Stop doing that!

42:11.819 --> 42:13.186
Yeah, I'm a retard, I know.

42:13.188 --> 42:16.358
WOMAN: Excuse me,
I have a question.

42:18.293 --> 42:22.161
SARAH: Hey, Kevin.

42:22.163 --> 42:24.163
Is everything okay?

42:24.165 --> 42:27.568
Yeah, I'm fine. Sure.
Let's go.

42:29.103 --> 42:31.471
This just keeps going
deeper and deeper.

42:31.473 --> 42:34.075
This is insane.

42:39.081 --> 42:40.913
Kevin?

42:40.915 --> 42:42.949
Kev? Indiana?

42:42.951 --> 42:44.183
KEVIN: I'm here.

42:44.185 --> 42:47.152
Hey. There you are.

42:47.154 --> 42:49.525
What is that?

43:02.136 --> 43:06.405
GUIDE: You can see the peephole,
the eye peek.

43:06.407 --> 43:11.110
There are plenty more like this
all around here.

43:11.112 --> 43:13.346
KEVIN: This guy is really
starting to bug me.

43:13.348 --> 43:16.014
- Can we get out now?
- Yeah, sure. We're almost done.

43:16.016 --> 43:17.483
GUIDE: Researchers
are still arguing

43:17.485 --> 43:19.319
what these holes are for.

43:19.321 --> 43:21.189
Some say it's for...

43:23.357 --> 43:24.891
SARAH: What's wrong?

43:24.893 --> 43:27.460
I'm suffocating in here.
I can't breathe.

43:27.462 --> 43:31.163
Oh, my God. It's okay.
Come on, it's okay.

43:31.165 --> 43:33.532
- Hey, are you good, white boy?
- Yeah, yeah, you guys go on.

43:33.534 --> 43:35.400
- We're fine.
- Are you sure?

43:35.402 --> 43:37.270
Yeah, yeah. We're just gonna
go out for some air, okay?

43:37.272 --> 43:39.139
We'll meet you
back at the hostel.

43:39.141 --> 43:41.040
Come on, Kevin.
Everything's okay.

43:41.042 --> 43:43.278
I'll take you outside.

43:44.411 --> 43:46.246
- It's okay.
- KEVIN: Come on, Sarah.

43:46.248 --> 43:49.449
- Everything's okay.
- No, it's not.

43:49.451 --> 43:51.951
I'm going to the city archives
to check the books.

43:51.953 --> 43:54.788
Kevin.
Kevin, wait for me.

43:54.790 --> 43:57.157
- Hey, Kevin!
- Something's not right.

43:57.159 --> 44:00.058
Hey, wait up!
Hey, Kevin!

44:00.060 --> 44:02.862
Oh, God.
That cave was insane, wasn't it?

44:02.864 --> 44:04.329
Yeah, it was nice.

44:04.331 --> 44:05.565
Too bad you guys weren't there
waiting for us.

44:05.567 --> 44:07.933
Omar took us to the best
hummus place.

44:07.935 --> 44:10.469
Kevin needed some air.
I'm really worried about him.

44:10.471 --> 44:13.907
Listen, Rache, I think we got
Jerusalem covered.

44:13.909 --> 44:15.942
I mean, I was talking to Kevin,

44:15.944 --> 44:17.543
and we're thinking of going
to Tel Aviv tomorrow night.

44:17.545 --> 44:19.012
What do you think?

44:19.014 --> 44:21.047
Why? The vacation's
just beginning.

44:21.049 --> 44:22.382
Are you serious?

44:22.384 --> 44:24.349
Now I want to stay,
and you want to go?

44:24.351 --> 44:27.954
Rache, there's something weird
about this place.

44:27.956 --> 44:30.290
Or maybe you two are developing
Jerusalem Syndrome,

44:30.292 --> 44:33.458
- and you are going crazy.
- Fuck you, Rache, I'm serious.

44:33.460 --> 44:37.396
Oh, God, Sarah, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm kidding,

44:37.398 --> 44:39.364
It's my bad joke.
I'm sorry.

44:39.366 --> 44:41.433
Okay.

44:41.435 --> 44:44.337
Look, the whole city's
shut down now anyway, okay?

44:44.339 --> 44:46.973
So the second Yom Kippur
is over, we're outta here.

44:46.975 --> 44:49.244
Promise? Hmm?

44:56.585 --> 44:58.016
[banging on door]

44:58.018 --> 44:59.518
KEVIN: Sarah, Rachel, open up!

44:59.520 --> 45:01.587
RACHEL: Sarah, what's going on
out there?

45:01.589 --> 45:04.891
You have to pack now!
We have to leave!

45:04.893 --> 45:07.159
SARAH: Why? What happened?
I don't understand.

45:07.161 --> 45:08.594
Kevin, listen to me.
Everything's gonna be fine.

45:08.596 --> 45:10.295
We're gonna go to Tel Aviv
tomorrow night.

45:10.297 --> 45:12.232
There's not gonna be
tomorrow night!

45:12.234 --> 45:14.099
- What are you talking about?
- I know you think I'm crazy.

45:14.101 --> 45:16.369
Something bad is happening
here, Sarah! Pack up!

45:16.371 --> 45:18.137
Kevin! Kevin don't!

45:18.139 --> 45:21.174
- RACHEL: What the fuck?!
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

45:21.176 --> 45:23.076
Kevin!

45:23.078 --> 45:25.578
You have to believe me
'cause they won't.

45:25.580 --> 45:27.980
SARAH: I don't understand
what you're talking about.

45:27.982 --> 45:30.049
Omar, Fauzi, everything's okay.
I got this.

45:30.051 --> 45:33.085
- [speaking Arabic]
- KEVIN: Sarah, tell them to go.

45:33.087 --> 45:36.021
Listen, Kevin, everything's
gonna be fine, okay?

45:36.023 --> 45:37.924

45:37.926 --> 45:40.058
No, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

KEVIN: Sarah, listen to me!

45:42.998 --> 45:45.163
- We have to leave!
- Were there any signs before?

45:45.165 --> 45:47.300
It's important
for you to remember.

45:47.302 --> 45:49.201
SARAH: I don't know.
He just started talking funny,

45:49.203 --> 45:52.304
and then all of a sudden...
I don't know. I don't know.

45:52.306 --> 45:54.040
Everything will be okay.
Don't worry.

45:54.042 --> 45:55.507
KEVIN: Get your hands off me!

45:55.509 --> 45:57.610
- Kevin, my friend, come.
- No, no, no, no!

45:57.612 --> 46:00.445
SARAH: Hey, Fauzi, stop.

46:00.447 --> 46:03.081
Hey, guys, where are you
taking him?

46:03.083 --> 46:05.684
OMAR: Come with us. Don't worry.
Everything will be okay.

46:05.686 --> 46:09.323
Come, come.
Watch the steps. Come.

46:16.464 --> 46:18.901
Are you okay, ladies?

46:27.475 --> 46:29.675
We have a saying here:

46:29.677 --> 46:32.045
"If you're talking to God,
it's good.

46:32.047 --> 46:35.648
But if God is talking to you,
then you have problem."

46:35.650 --> 46:37.683
- Where have they taken him?
- Don't worry.

46:37.685 --> 46:40.987
He will rest a few days,
and he will be as good as new.

46:40.989 --> 46:44.991
That's what usually happens
to people who go [whistles].

46:44.993 --> 46:46.592
It's not the first time
it's happened here, is it?

46:46.594 --> 46:52.030
No. This happens a lot here,
especially to Catholics.

46:52.032 --> 46:54.567
Go figure.

46:54.569 --> 46:58.874
Anyway, I see you later,
ladies? Hmm?

47:01.042 --> 47:03.108
Don't worry.
He will be just fine.

47:03.110 --> 47:04.543
RACHEL: The second Yom Kippur
is over,

47:04.545 --> 47:06.311
we're on the first bus
out of this place.

47:06.313 --> 47:09.014
- We're restarting this trip.
- What about Kevin?

47:09.016 --> 47:11.083
You heard what Omar said.
He's gonna be fine.

47:11.085 --> 47:13.186
Just give him a couple of days.
He's gonna be as good as new.

47:13.188 --> 47:14.686
Don't worry.

47:14.688 --> 47:16.221
Okay.

47:16.223 --> 47:18.224
Okay. Let's go get some rest.

47:18.226 --> 47:19.659
It's Judgment Day tonight,

47:19.661 --> 47:22.261
and God knows I've got
a lot of sins to redeem.

47:22.263 --> 47:23.497
Yeah, right.

47:25.299 --> 47:28.400
Listen, I'll meet you
back at the room, okay?

Something about
a terrorist attack or something.

01:02:24.397 --> 01:02:25.963
David!

01:02:25.965 --> 01:02:27.965
That's David.

01:02:27.967 --> 01:02:29.534
David!

01:02:29.536 --> 01:02:31.302
Move out of the way!
Get out of the way!

01:02:31.304 --> 01:02:33.137
Get out of the way!
David!

01:02:33.139 --> 01:02:35.641
MAN ON MEGAPHONE: <i>I repeat,
stand back right now!</i>

01:02:35.643 --> 01:02:39.277
- David, go!
- <i>Sir, stand back!</i>

01:02:39.279 --> 01:02:41.679
- <i>This is your last warning!</i>
- [gunshots]

- [automatic gunfire]
- KEVIN: Move back, move back!

01:02:51.491 --> 01:02:53.527
Come on! Go!

01:02:56.697 --> 01:02:58.329
Kevin, what do we do?
What do we do now?

01:02:58.331 --> 01:03:02.634
Omar.
[speaking Arabic]

01:03:02.636 --> 01:03:04.168
Let's go and try the Zion Gate.

01:03:04.170 --> 01:03:06.003
Maybe there will be
less soldiers there.

01:03:06.005 --> 01:03:08.105
- Follow us, follow us.
- Come on, come on!

01:03:08.107 --> 01:03:10.744
Come on! Come on!

01:03:14.447 --> 01:03:16.114

SARAH: Motherfuckers.

01:03:19.987 --> 01:03:22.186
- Fuck you, asshole!
- RACHEL: Sarah, come on!

01:03:22.188 --> 01:03:24.088
- How could you leave us there?
- Sarah!

01:03:24.090 --> 01:03:25.556
It doesn't matter anyway.

01:03:25.558 --> 01:03:27.391
We came here too late,
and we're all fucked.

01:03:27.393 --> 01:03:29.194
The city is under siege.

01:03:29.196 --> 01:03:30.728
Fuck off!

01:03:30.730 --> 01:03:32.331
Come on. Let's go.

01:03:32.333 --> 01:03:34.199
TOMER: Wait.
Where are you heading?

01:03:34.201 --> 01:03:36.000
KEVIN: We're going to try
the next gate.

01:03:36.002 --> 01:03:37.438
Let's go.

01:03:38.639 --> 01:03:40.204
TOMER: Wait, wait, wait.

01:03:40.206 --> 01:03:42.273
We're coming with you.
Wait. Yehuda!

01:03:42.275 --> 01:03:44.208
SARAH: Fuck you, asshole!

01:03:44.210 --> 01:03:45.845
Wait. Hey!

01:03:50.217 --> 01:03:52.320
There. There.

01:03:58.192 --> 01:03:59.291
[screaming]

01:03:59.293 --> 01:04:01.058
Oh, my God.

01:04:01.060 --> 01:04:04.462
- KEVIN: Holy shit.
- [shrieking]

01:04:04.464 --> 01:04:07.132
SARAH: Those fuckers can fly?

01:04:07.134 --> 01:04:09.370
Open the door!

01:04:13.339 --> 01:04:15.773

[conversation in Hebrew]

01:04:55.181 --> 01:04:58.349
Thanks for not
leaving me back there.

01:04:58.351 --> 01:05:00.819
- I owe you one.
- It's cool.

01:05:00.821 --> 01:05:03.957
I'll think of something
when we leave this crazy city.

01:05:06.692 --> 01:05:08.360
Don't worry.

01:05:08.362 --> 01:05:10.395
We will.

01:05:10.397 --> 01:05:12.532
Yeah.

01:05:13.833 --> 01:05:15.534
RACHEL: Can somebody
explain to me, please,

01:05:15.536 --> 01:05:18.070
what the fuck is going
on here?

01:05:18.072 --> 01:05:19.637
I mean, seriously,
you guys are soldiers.

01:05:19.639 --> 01:05:22.107
Why the fuck were they
shooting at you?

01:05:22.109 --> 01:05:26.777
OMAR: Why don't they let us out?
What are you hiding from us?

01:05:26.779 --> 01:05:28.813
- YEHUDA: They're afraid.
- TOMER: Not afraid, okay?

01:05:28.815 --> 01:05:30.315
We are not afraid.

01:05:30.317 --> 01:05:32.150
There's nothing
to be afraid of, okay?

01:05:32.152 --> 01:05:34.319
There are 2,000 soldiers
in this town

01:05:34.321 --> 01:05:36.320
with orders and procedures.

01:05:36.322 --> 01:05:38.322
They're trained
for every scenario.

01:05:38.324 --> 01:05:40.491
So don't be afraid, okay?

01:05:40.493 --> 01:05:42.494
- Not for this one.
- Yehuda, shut up.

01:05:42.496 --> 01:05:44.295
[speaking Hebrew]

01:05:44.297 --> 01:05:46.566
All these things
happening tonight?

01:05:48.235 --> 01:05:51.335
They teach us at school
to be good kids

01:05:51.337 --> 01:05:54.572
because on Yom Kippur,
Judgment Day...

01:05:54.574 --> 01:05:57.275
It's religious bullshit.
[speaking Hebrew]

01:05:57.277 --> 01:05:59.277
The sky is opening up,

01:05:59.279 --> 01:06:01.480
and God judges everyone,

01:06:01.482 --> 01:06:03.882
our sins and our good deeds.

01:06:03.884 --> 01:06:06.150
SARAH: Yehuda, what are you
talking about?

01:06:06.152 --> 01:06:09.320
But it's not the sky
that is opening up tonight.

01:06:09.322 --> 01:06:11.489
- It's the ground.
- [speaking Hebrew]

01:06:11.491 --> 01:06:14.358
- SARAH: Tomer, that's enough!
- KEVIN: Let him talk.

01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:17.329
I have no idea
what's happening tonight.

01:06:17.331 --> 01:06:18.896

I'm shitting my pants.

01:06:32.513 --> 01:06:34.612

Just cut it out, okay?

[speaking Hebrew]

01:06:36.250 --> 01:06:38.183

to talk like this.

01:06:38.185 --> 01:06:39.617
My family's here
for 20 generations.

01:06:39.619 --> 01:06:41.619

01:06:46.627 --> 01:06:47.858
Calm down!
Hey! Come on!

01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:49.895
You shut up, you Arab fucker!

01:06:49.897 --> 01:06:51.395
RACHEL: What?

01:06:51.397 --> 01:06:53.900
- Cool it!
- Shut up!

01:06:58.404 --> 01:07:00.271
These glasses are killing me.

01:07:00.273 --> 01:07:02.507
I don't think we're gonna
get out of here, Rache.

01:07:02.509 --> 01:07:04.342
Hey.

01:07:04.344 --> 01:07:05.610
Stop.

01:07:05.612 --> 01:07:08.413
Look, I got your back, okay?

01:07:08.415 --> 01:07:10.415
We're gonna make it
out of this...

01:07:10.417 --> 01:07:12.284
the way we always do.

01:07:12.286 --> 01:07:13.317
Okay.

01:07:13.319 --> 01:07:14.886
You guys okay?

01:07:14.888 --> 01:07:17.788
Remind me to never take
travel advice from you again.

01:07:17.790 --> 01:07:21.226
We've got to figure out a way
to get outside these walls.

01:07:21.228 --> 01:07:22.626
How? We're surrounded
by soldiers,

01:07:22.628 --> 01:07:23.862
and the gates are closed.

01:07:23.864 --> 01:07:25.730
FAUZI: I have idea.
There is a way.

01:07:25.732 --> 01:07:27.431
- Crazy. It won't work.
- What?

01:07:27.433 --> 01:07:31.436
[speaking Arabic]

01:07:31.438 --> 01:07:32.770
SARAH: What?

01:07:32.772 --> 01:07:34.538
When he was a kid,
he used to smuggle food...

01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:36.907
He wants to go out
through the caves.

01:07:36.909 --> 01:07:38.742
But it's one big maze
down there.

01:07:38.744 --> 01:07:44.648
[speaking Arabic]

01:07:44.650 --> 01:07:46.250
It was 40 years ago,

01:07:46.252 --> 01:07:47.751
but he thinks he can
remember the way out.

01:07:47.753 --> 01:07:49.420
TOMER: Oh, he thinks!

01:07:49.422 --> 01:07:51.389
SARAH: Okay, what are we
waiting for? Let's go.

01:07:51.391 --> 01:07:53.824
What? You wanna go down to those
caves with those creatures?

01:07:53.826 --> 01:07:54.992
No fucking way.

01:07:54.994 --> 01:07:56.695
Rache, if we stay here,
we die.

01:07:56.697 --> 01:07:59.663
My dad is right.
The only way out of this city

01:07:59.665 --> 01:08:01.632
is down the caves
and under the walls.

01:08:01.634 --> 01:08:03.867
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.
- But it's so stupid!

01:08:03.869 --> 01:08:06.737
Sounds like a plan.
A stupid one, but a plan.

01:08:06.739 --> 01:08:08.440
Get ready.
We're moving. Come on.

01:08:08.442 --> 01:08:11.342
[speaking Hebrew]

01:08:11.344 --> 01:08:13.612

- RACHEL: Guys?

01:08:13.614 --> 01:08:14.980
- What?
- What is it?

01:08:14.982 --> 01:08:16.680
- Guys!
- Rache, what is it?

01:08:16.683 --> 01:08:18.649
- OMAR: What is it, Rachel?
- You gotta see this.

01:08:18.652 --> 01:08:20.720
SARAH: I don't see anything.

01:08:22.889 --> 01:08:24.654
Glass, zoom in.

01:08:24.657 --> 01:08:26.660
What is that?

01:08:31.497 --> 01:08:33.533

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:37.203
KEVIN: Let's go, guys!
Hurry up!

01:08:38.404 --> 01:08:41.506

We gotta get out of here.

01:08:53.419 --> 01:08:56.819

01:08:58.792 --> 01:09:01.524
Guys? Why have you stopped?

01:09:01.527 --> 01:09:04.197
[speaking Hebrew]

01:09:07.533 --> 01:09:09.501

01:09:19.745 --> 01:09:22.645

01:09:22.648 --> 01:09:26.484
Rache. Rache?
Are you okay?

01:09:26.486 --> 01:09:27.952
Yeah.

01:09:27.953 --> 01:09:29.554
It's okay.

01:09:29.555 --> 01:09:31.191
It's okay.

01:09:35.562 --> 01:09:36.894
Hey.

01:09:36.895 --> 01:09:38.662
See the street?

01:09:38.663 --> 01:09:40.430
It's the Via Delarosa.

01:09:40.433 --> 01:09:43.100
It's about 600 meters
to the cave entrance.

01:09:43.102 --> 01:09:45.569
We're almost there.
Don't worry.

01:09:45.571 --> 01:09:48.540
Everything will be fine.

01:09:48.542 --> 01:09:50.109
Yeah.

01:09:51.578 --> 01:09:52.877
SARAH: Rache?

01:09:52.879 --> 01:09:55.880
- What have you got there?
- What?

01:09:55.882 --> 01:09:58.449
Oh, my God.

01:09:58.451 --> 01:10:00.452
I'm fine. It's nothing.

01:10:00.454 --> 01:10:01.988
Kevin?

01:10:03.789 --> 01:10:05.457
It's nothing.

01:10:05.459 --> 01:10:07.591
What?

01:10:07.593 --> 01:10:09.394
Well, what? Talk to me.

01:10:09.396 --> 01:10:11.496
SARAH: Nothing.
Are you feeling okay?

01:10:11.498 --> 01:10:13.497
Yes! I told you I'm fine!
What the fuck's wrong with you?

01:10:13.499 --> 01:10:16.169
Nothing.
It's just a scratch.

01:10:18.771 --> 01:10:21.007
Use this.

01:10:26.612 --> 01:10:28.613
So what do we do now?

01:10:28.615 --> 01:10:30.482
I don't know.

01:10:30.484 --> 01:10:32.917
I think we have
to tell the others.

01:10:32.919 --> 01:10:34.586
What?

01:10:34.588 --> 01:10:37.055
Before it's too late.
We have to tell them.

01:10:37.057 --> 01:10:38.422
No fucking way.

01:10:38.424 --> 01:10:41.458
- Listen.
- No, just listen to me.

01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:43.461
I don't trust these guys, okay?

01:10:43.463 --> 01:10:46.131
They're soldiers.
They're gonna kill her.

01:10:46.133 --> 01:10:48.832
This thing is contagious.

01:10:48.834 --> 01:10:51.668
You saw what happened
at the asylum.

01:10:51.670 --> 01:10:54.939
She'll become violent soon.
We have to do something

01:10:54.941 --> 01:10:57.442
or none of us is getting
out of those caves alive.

01:10:57.444 --> 01:10:59.443
That's why we need
to get her to a doctor now.

01:10:59.445 --> 01:11:02.447
- She'll be fine.
- It's too dangerous.

01:11:02.449 --> 01:11:04.849
So what are you gonna do?
We're just gonna leave her here?

01:11:04.851 --> 01:11:06.650
Maybe.

01:11:06.652 --> 01:11:09.019
I don't know.

01:11:09.021 --> 01:11:11.257
Just like they left you?

01:11:16.663 --> 01:11:19.530
You listen to me.

01:11:19.532 --> 01:11:22.065
You owe me, okay?
I saved your ass.

01:11:22.067 --> 01:11:25.470
So you just shut up
and do this for my friend.

01:11:25.472 --> 01:11:27.905
OMAR: Guys, come on!

01:11:27.907 --> 01:11:30.542
