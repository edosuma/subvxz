14:47.023 --> 14:48.521

14:48.522 --> 14:49.733

to worry for one second

He still is.

But it doesn't change
the color of his money.

15:14.524 --> 15:18.022
You don't know him, Teddy.
You think you do, but you don't.

15:18.023 --> 15:20.192
O-okay, okay. You're right. Maybe I don't.

15:20.193 --> 15:22.862

you were talking about

15:48.904 --> 15:50.403

Has that ever been recorded?

19:04.671 --> 19:06.630

19:06.631 --> 19:09.250
Pretty much damns it to obscurity.

19:09.251 --> 19:10.550

19:26.501 --> 19:28.130
No.

His wife's baby's due two
weeks into the tour.

19:39.550 --> 19:40.791
I'm-a have to replace him anyway.

19:40.792 --> 19:43.250
Yeah, I can't do that. Why not?

19:43.251 --> 19:45.210
I can't do that to Rayna.

19:45.211 --> 19:47.670
I'll pay double whatever she pays.

19:47.671 --> 19:48.881
Why would you do that?

Juliette Barnes asked me if I wanted a job.

24:21.591 --> 24:23.250
She asked you?

24:23.251 --> 24:24.840
Yeah. As what?

24:24.841 --> 24:26.290
Uh, lead guitar.

24:26.291 --> 24:30.210
Bandleader. Her guy leaves in a few weeks.

24:30.211 --> 24:33.000
What'd you say? Nothing.

24:33.001 --> 24:35.171
I mean, I'm not available till
otherwise notified, right?

24:35.172 --> 24:37.050

24:37.051 --> 24:38.419
She wants you in her band.

24:38.420 --> 24:39.251
What, she coming for my house next?

24:39.252 --> 24:43.170

24:43.171 --> 24:47.090
Ooh. She got to you in your soft spot.

24:47.091 --> 24:50.170
Always wondered why you
never cut more of my songs.

24:53.171 --> 24:56.250
I don't know. It felt weird.

24:56.251 --> 24:59.290
Maybe they were all about me or something.

24:59.291 --> 25:01.550
They are.

25:01.551 --> 25:03.000
I guess.

Sometimes I wish I could just
do everything all over again.

25:05.791 --> 25:07.750
What would you change?

25:07.751 --> 25:09.380
Nothin'.

29:20.617 --> 29:22.325
who go up against you, Lamar.

29:22.326 --> 29:24.325
Ah.

29:24.326 --> 29:25.985
No dirty tricks.

29:25.986 --> 29:29.485
No rumors, no "unnamed sources."

29:29.486 --> 29:31.115
If I'm gonna run, I have to do it

29:31.116 --> 29:34.615
without destroying his
family or his reputation.

29:34.616 --> 29:35.945
Agreed?

29:39.906 --> 29:41.945
Agreed.

29:41.946 --> 29:43.825
Carlisle announces on Monday.

29:43.826 --> 29:45.035
So will we.

29:45.036 --> 29:46.615
What about Rayna?

29:46.616 --> 29:47.986
Yeah, who's gonna tell her?

29:47.987 --> 29:51.905
You are. Your first order of
business as a mayoral candidate

29:51.906 --> 29:54.275
is to grow a pair.

29:54.276 --> 29:57.275
(Chuckles)

29:57.276 --> 29:58.906
Mayor? Since when do you wanna be mayor?

29:58.907 --> 30:00.405
You hate politics.

30:00.406 --> 30:02.694
I don't hate politics.
I hate talking about politics.

30:02.695 --> 30:03.946
(Dishes clatter)

30:03.947 --> 30:06.865
(Scoffs) It's not even
as if this is your idea.

30:06.866 --> 30:08.736
It doesn't mean it wasn't a good one.

30:08.737 --> 30:11.735
You don't know what you're
getting into with him.

30:11.736 --> 30:14.485
You don't wanna be owned
by him, trust me. Rayna...

30:14.486 --> 30:16.485
you will regret this.

30:16.486 --> 30:17.866
Has it ever occurred to you that
maybe he's trying to help me

30:17.867 --> 30:20.865
and that I could use a little
bit of help right about now?

30:20.866 --> 30:22.575
If I serve a term or two as mayor,

30:22.576 --> 30:24.946
I can write my own ticket,
and you can stop working.

30:24.947 --> 30:26.485
(Utensil clatters)

30:26.486 --> 30:29.155
I don't want that!

30:29.156 --> 30:30.905
Is that what you want from me?

30:30.906 --> 30:32.446
You want me to just take some time off

30:32.447 --> 30:35.445
so I can stand on the side of the stage

30:35.446 --> 30:36.904
and smile and shake hands?

30:36.905 --> 30:37.944
Oh, you wanna tell me something

30:37.945 --> 30:39.234
about standing on the side of the stage

30:39.235 --> 30:40.696
that I don't already know?

30:40.697 --> 30:42.865
I know that I wasn't your first choice.

30:42.866 --> 30:44.196
I know you settled for me,

30:44.197 --> 30:47.485
but I have been there for
you every step of the way.

30:47.486 --> 30:49.865
How about helping me put
my life back together?

30:49.866 --> 30:53.035
How about letting me step into
the limelight for a change?

31:12.906 --> 31:16.775
I told Cole I'd perform
at his announcement.

31:19.906 --> 31:21.905
Well...

31:21.906 --> 31:23.985
What are you gonna do?

31:29.486 --> 31:31.575
I'm gonna go check on the kids.

31:40.366 --> 31:41.946
You showing these to your Uncle Deacon?

31:41.947 --> 31:43.365
What?

31:43.366 --> 31:44.865
These are songs.

31:44.866 --> 31:46.115
They're poems.

31:46.116 --> 31:47.735
They about someone in particular?

31:47.736 --> 31:49.655
Avery and I broke up a while.

31:49.656 --> 31:54.235
Um... well, nothing calls on
the muses like a broken heart.

31:54.236 --> 31:55.866
Truth be told, other than
heartbreak and drunken sex,

31:55.867 --> 31:58.275
well, I'm not 100% sure
what you see in him.

31:58.276 --> 31:59.775
It's one of those things, I guess.

31:59.776 --> 32:03.485
I've tried being without him, and I can't.

32:03.486 --> 32:04.735
He's the one.

32:04.736 --> 32:08.195
I don't believe in that.
There's always another one.

32:08.196 --> 32:11.735
Sounds like you've had a
little heartbreak of your own.

32:11.736 --> 32:14.945
(Chuckles)

32:14.946 --> 32:16.114
These poems are good.

32:16.115 --> 32:18.076
You ever thought about
putting 'em to music?

32:18.077 --> 32:20.115
Oh, uh, sometimes I hear music in my head

32:20.116 --> 32:22.116
when I'm writing 'em, but
mostly they're just thoughts

32:22.117 --> 32:24.775
and... ah! Hang on a minute.

32:24.776 --> 32:25.865
Do you play?

32:25.866 --> 32:28.695
I know basic chords.
Things for choir and...

32:28.696 --> 32:29.906
You play what you heard
when you wrote this.

32:29.907 --> 32:31.695
Oh, no, no, I can't.

32:31.696 --> 32:34.945
All right, well, you sing, and I'll play.

32:43.406 --> 32:46.155

33:11.116 --> 33:13.364
Marshall, how are you?
Miss Jaymes, welcome. Welcome.

33:13.365 --> 33:14.734
It's a pleasure. Nice to meet you.

33:14.735 --> 33:16.114
You, too. Please come in. Thank you.

33:16.115 --> 33:17.736
Hello. Hey, it's great to see you again.

33:17.737 --> 33:20.445
Nice to see you. I would love
to have a conversation with you

33:20.446 --> 33:22.694
about the current situation,
see if we can't come up

33:22.695 --> 33:24.536
with some mutually agreeable solution.

33:24.537 --> 33:27.115
Nothing would please me more.
We want you to be happy.

33:27.116 --> 33:28.736
Well, you know, I know you're new here,

33:28.737 --> 33:31.865
but I have to tell you, I
think Edgehill is my home.

33:31.866 --> 33:33.736
You know, I've been here
since I cut my first album,

33:33.737 --> 33:35.655
which went triple platinum.

33:35.656 --> 33:37.535
I've won nine Grammys,

33:37.536 --> 33:38.735
four C.M.A.S.

33:38.736 --> 33:41.735
You know, when I signed at this label,

33:41.736 --> 33:42.776
it was at the most rundown little house

33:42.777 --> 33:45.235
over there on music row.

33:45.236 --> 33:47.275
I mean, I feel like I built this company.

33:47.276 --> 33:49.275
Miss Jaymes, please, no one's gonna argue

33:49.276 --> 33:51.154
that you've had an unparalleled career.

33:51.155 --> 33:52.946
I wish the new record
was performing better.

33:52.947 --> 33:55.655
Unfortunately, the older
business models are irrelevant.

33:55.656 --> 33:58.825
We believe that you and Juliette together

33:58.826 --> 34:00.735
will be a huge event.

34:00.736 --> 34:01.984
I understand that.

34:01.985 --> 34:03.576
Listen, I stayed loyal to this company

34:03.577 --> 34:05.655
when every other label was
trying to woo me away.

34:05.656 --> 34:07.825
I've got an album that I'm very proud of,

34:07.826 --> 34:09.616
and I'm just asking for a
little support for that album

34:09.617 --> 34:12.275
and for the tour that will help sell it.

34:12.275 --> 34:15.275
Miss Jaymes, you've gotta find
your place in a new market.

34:15.275 --> 34:17.156
I know that's not what you wanna hear.

34:19.576 --> 34:23.576
So you're telling me after
21 years at this label,

34:23.906 --> 34:25.824
if I don't...

34:25.826 --> 34:28.574
Open for your little ingenue
who wouldn't make it

34:28.576 --> 34:31.574
as one of my backup singers,

34:31.576 --> 34:33.574
that you're not gonna support me?

34:33.576 --> 34:35.905
Those are your words, not mine.

34:35.906 --> 34:38.735
But still, I need to know your decision.

34:41.156 --> 34:44.614
Well, you can kiss my decision
as it's walking out the door.

34:56.411 --> 34:58.211
I know you can't conceive of me

34:58.212 --> 35:00.501
actually helping a member of my own family,

35:00.502 --> 35:01.790
and you're gonna continue to punish me

35:01.791 --> 35:03.292
for the derelicts of my paternal duties

35:03.293 --> 35:04.831
till I'm 6 feet under,

35:04.832 --> 35:07.581
but I think you're being a little bit harsh.
Stop the speeches.

35:07.582 --> 35:08.790
You know what? I just wanna know,

35:08.791 --> 35:10.040
exactly what do you want from Teddy?

35:10.041 --> 35:11.212
'Cause I know you want something.

35:11.213 --> 35:14.001
What I want is for him to pick himself up,

35:14.002 --> 35:16.171
dust himself off, and get back in the game.

35:16.172 --> 35:17.711
Mm-hmm.

35:17.712 --> 35:19.582
This could be good for you and the girls.

35:19.583 --> 35:22.291
It could restore Teddy's confidence...

35:22.292 --> 35:23.502
Stop. And his standing in the community.

35:23.503 --> 35:25.041
Tandy, stop it!

35:26.502 --> 35:28.671
Are you trying to lure him with the money?

35:28.672 --> 35:30.212
Is that what it is? 'Cause you know

35:30.213 --> 35:32.711
we're not gonna accept it.
We're not going to.

35:32.712 --> 35:34.461
Oh, I know.

35:34.462 --> 35:37.791
You're too proud to
accept anything from me.

35:37.792 --> 35:39.912
You prefer to delude yourself
into thinking that your success

35:39.913 --> 35:42.671
was all your own doing, that I
had no hand in it whatsoever,

35:42.672 --> 35:46.041
when every dime you ever
earned is because of me.

35:46.042 --> 35:47.621
What?

35:47.622 --> 35:48.962
Who do you think paid for your first album?

35:48.963 --> 35:50.961
That pissant little record label?

35:50.962 --> 35:53.831
Huh?

35:53.832 --> 35:55.831
What are you talking about?

35:55.832 --> 35:58.671
Rayna, I want you there
by his side tonight.

35:58.672 --> 36:02.672
How would it look if you're not
there for your own husband?

36:05.332 --> 36:08.411
I cannot believe that you'd
further humiliate him

36:08.412 --> 36:10.411
after all he has done for you,

36:10.412 --> 36:12.411
especially as it relates to little Maddie.

36:12.412 --> 36:15.211
Imagine how he would feel if
he knew what you had done...

36:15.212 --> 36:17.672
are you kidding me?!
That's enough! That's enough!

36:17.673 --> 36:19.501
You know what?! No!

36:19.502 --> 36:20.872
We cannot be bought! Do you hear me?!

36:20.873 --> 36:22.251
Yeah?

36:22.252 --> 36:24.040
I cannot be bought, and I am
not gonna be there tonight.

36:24.041 --> 36:25.290
You know... I am not
gonna be there tonight!

36:25.291 --> 36:27.172
It's all right if you see me as your enemy.

36:27.173 --> 36:30.001
Don't you be foolish enough to
make that a two-way street.
