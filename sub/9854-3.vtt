00:00.681 --> 00:02.415
Who will rule once I am gone?

00:04.205 --> 00:06.173
- The king is dead.
- Long live the king.

00:06.174 --> 00:09.376
- This is...
- That's Jack. Jack's a bastard.

00:09.377 --> 00:10.777
He's a gifted bastard.

00:10.778 --> 00:13.447
The way to my daughter's heart
is through affection.

00:14.682 --> 00:17.250
Bartholomew has sided
against King Stephen.

00:17.251 --> 00:18.785
He's turned traitor.

00:18.786 --> 00:21.355
- You're under attack!
- We must defend the king!

00:22.390 --> 00:25.525
- Halt!
- Thank you, Earl of Shiring.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.627
- My name is Ellen.
- Tom.

00:27.628 --> 00:29.062
Tom the builder.

00:29.063 --> 00:32.499
Why can't God give me work
just this once?

00:32.500 --> 00:34.368
What happened?

00:34.369 --> 00:35.635
We can stay now.

00:37.672 --> 00:40.707
<i>You can't rebuild
a cathedral without its relic.</i>

00:40.708 --> 00:42.609
<i>This may be
the devil's work</i>

00:42.610 --> 00:45.112
<i>but it was God that
sent you a master builder.</i>

00:45.113 --> 00:47.481
What makes you think
there'll be a new church?

00:47.482 --> 00:49.816
- I will build it.
- I swear by all that's holy,

00:49.817 --> 00:51.351
you'll never build your church.

00:51.352 --> 00:53.086
- Aaah!
- No!

00:55.957 --> 00:59.426
Richard, listen to me.
You mustn't tell anyone, ever.

01:00.528 --> 01:02.829
Piss on you, Lord Bishop.

01:04.031 --> 01:06.233
We've begun.

02:14.035 --> 02:15.735
One!

02:17.038 --> 02:18.038
Hey!

02:18.039 --> 02:19.372
Make way!

02:20.475 --> 02:21.708
I am Queen Maud

02:21.709 --> 02:24.444
and this is my bastard
brother Gloucester!

02:24.445 --> 02:25.612
Oh, King Stephen!

02:25.613 --> 02:27.247
Ha! Take that!
Ha, ha!

02:28.883 --> 02:30.417
Take that, you!

02:30.418 --> 02:32.819
Oh! I'm slain! Ooh!

02:34.088 --> 02:35.622
Thieving swine!

02:37.692 --> 02:41.261
Simon Goodfellow:
thievery!

02:41.262 --> 02:43.129
Lop his hands off!

02:43.130 --> 02:45.699
Kill him!
Kill their faith!

02:45.700 --> 02:46.733
Come on!

02:48.503 --> 02:50.203
Don't look, Richard.

02:54.976 --> 02:56.977
You thieving dog!

02:56.978 --> 02:59.513
- Cut his hands!
- Justice!

03:07.121 --> 03:09.122
Get off! Get off!

03:14.562 --> 03:16.162
Good morning, Your Eminence.

03:16.163 --> 03:17.631
I hear you've been injured.

03:17.632 --> 03:18.899
Nothing serious, I pray.

03:18.900 --> 03:20.300
- A mere foot-soldier's wound

03:20.301 --> 03:22.335
in God's battle
against Satan, dear Regan.

03:22.336 --> 03:23.503
Percy.
Bishop.

03:23.504 --> 03:24.971
William?

03:24.972 --> 03:26.940
Still pining for Aliena, hmm?

03:26.941 --> 03:29.376
We're fortunate
he turned that suit down.

03:29.377 --> 03:30.710
Indeed.

03:32.513 --> 03:34.814
Make way
for the king!

03:41.455 --> 03:44.624
His Majesty, King Stephen!

03:50.798 --> 03:53.066
We are pleased to announce

03:53.067 --> 03:55.368
that with the events
of this day,

03:55.369 --> 03:59.105
all opposition to our
rightful rule is extinguished.

03:59.106 --> 04:01.508
Maud and Gloucester's army
has been put to flight

04:01.509 --> 04:05.312
and there are now only
loyal men in England!

04:08.549 --> 04:10.350
I didn't know
they were defeated.

04:10.351 --> 04:11.685
Is this recent?

04:11.686 --> 04:13.987
He tells the peasants
what they need to hear,

04:13.988 --> 04:16.723
and the king needs soldiers,
but is penniless.

04:16.724 --> 04:17.991
This will cost us.

04:17.992 --> 04:21.761
Bring out the traitor,
Bartholomew of Shiring!

04:21.762 --> 04:23.029
Burn him!

04:23.030 --> 04:25.131
Treacherous bastard!

04:25.132 --> 04:27.400
- Traitor!
- Die, you bastard!

04:27.401 --> 04:29.202
Traitor!

04:30.771 --> 04:34.040
Burn in hell, you traitor!

04:34.041 --> 04:35.508
You old bastard!

04:35.509 --> 04:37.544
Skin him alive!

04:38.613 --> 04:40.146
String him up!

04:44.385 --> 04:47.721
You'll get what you deserve!

04:47.722 --> 04:50.056
Mercy, Your Majesty!

04:55.029 --> 04:56.696
My father loves England!

04:56.697 --> 04:59.899
Spare his life, I beg you,
for his children's sake!

04:59.900 --> 05:00.967
For mercy's sake!

05:04.572 --> 05:05.839
Is this your brother?

05:08.042 --> 05:09.509
Yes, it is.

05:09.510 --> 05:10.877
How old are you, boy?

05:10.878 --> 05:13.546
16, Your Majesty.

05:13.547 --> 05:16.282
I have no quarrel
with the traitor's children.

05:16.283 --> 05:19.719
If you wish, you may join
my army to prove your loyalty.

05:19.720 --> 05:22.055
Please, spare our father, Sire.

05:22.056 --> 05:23.456
Enough about your father.

05:24.558 --> 05:26.226
Give me your answer, boy.

05:37.304 --> 05:40.573
I swear, by Jesus Christ,
and all his saints,

05:40.574 --> 05:44.010
that I will not rest until
Richard is the Earl of Shiring

05:44.011 --> 05:45.712
and Lord of the land,

05:45.713 --> 05:47.681
that you once ruled.

05:57.758 --> 05:59.926
As a knight, Your Majesty.

05:59.927 --> 06:02.829
Give him the knighthood
and the title that he deserves.

06:04.331 --> 06:06.366
You're a bold woman.

06:06.367 --> 06:08.935
Perhaps you should
join my army instead.

06:11.672 --> 06:14.074
Once you're outfitted
with horse and armor

06:14.075 --> 06:16.142
report to my
Captain of the Guards.

06:16.143 --> 06:17.944
We'll decide what
to do with you then.

06:17.945 --> 06:19.746
Many thanks, Your Majesty,

06:19.747 --> 06:22.082
and may God save England.

06:22.083 --> 06:25.051
With your
father's death, He will.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.728
On your knees.

06:54.949 --> 06:56.750
God save the king!

07:15.669 --> 07:18.671
I won't fight for Stephen.
He's our father's worst enemy!

07:18.672 --> 07:21.274
And the only man who can
give you back your title.

07:21.275 --> 07:22.709
I won't ride into battle

07:22.710 --> 07:24.244
alongside William
and his henchmen!

07:24.245 --> 07:25.512
I'll kill them first!

07:25.513 --> 07:26.746
It's easier to kill someone

07:26.747 --> 07:28.181
if you're standing beside them

07:28.182 --> 07:29.415
rather than against them.

07:29.416 --> 07:30.416
Look at me, Richard.

07:30.417 --> 07:32.018
Our enemies have
made us strong.

07:32.019 --> 07:35.355
We'll go to the priest and take
back the money Father gave him,

07:35.356 --> 07:37.624
more than enough to
buy you horse and armor

07:37.625 --> 07:39.192
and to purchase a knighthood.

07:39.193 --> 07:40.693
Your tears are worthless now.

07:40.694 --> 07:42.061
We have a promise to keep.

07:47.768 --> 07:50.470
Heave, ho! Heave, ho!

07:53.707 --> 07:56.376
Lower it! Come on!

08:07.621 --> 08:10.023
Brother, no!
Don't close your eyes!

08:10.024 --> 08:11.624
You'll break your thumb!

08:11.625 --> 08:13.259
That's it.
That's right.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.630
I need a measurement here!

08:17.631 --> 08:19.232
Go get me the straw, boy!

08:19.233 --> 08:21.034
Careful, Brother Matthew.

08:21.035 --> 08:24.404
There are 7 deadly sins
of carpentry too, you know.

08:24.405 --> 08:27.273
St. Joseph's watching.
I'm his enforcer!

08:31.178 --> 08:33.346
I see more coming over.

08:33.347 --> 08:35.748
Cut it while it's dry,
I always say.

08:35.749 --> 08:37.283
Look lively, Jack!

08:37.284 --> 08:39.619
You can move faster than that!

08:39.620 --> 08:41.821
We are far
behind schedule, Prior.

08:41.822 --> 08:45.558
This builder is too slow
and far too ambitious.

08:45.559 --> 08:47.927
I've seen his plans.

08:47.928 --> 08:49.896
Those arches are untried.

08:49.897 --> 08:51.931
This is not an experiment!

08:53.100 --> 08:55.301
We should be building
a smaller church

08:55.302 --> 08:56.936
exactly like the one we had.

08:56.937 --> 08:58.905
Trust him, Remigius.
Trust God.

08:58.906 --> 09:00.673
God's not happy either, Prior!

09:00.674 --> 09:02.542
He should be
using skilled labor,

09:02.543 --> 09:04.310
not monks stolen from prayer.

09:04.311 --> 09:05.912
Work is prayer, Brother.

09:07.781 --> 09:11.751
In the meantime, I am going
to Winchester Market

09:11.752 --> 09:15.021
to sell the fleece
from our flock.

09:15.022 --> 09:16.522
This will bring in money

09:16.523 --> 09:18.725
which will allow us
to hire workers.

09:18.726 --> 09:20.560
Tom is going to Shiring quarry

09:20.561 --> 09:23.463
to make arrangements
for harvesting the stone.

09:23.464 --> 09:25.732
This will serve as
our true beginning

09:25.733 --> 09:28.501
and our schedule shall
be counted from then.

09:31.805 --> 09:32.939
Anything else?

09:32.940 --> 09:34.574
Forgive me.
I was expressing...

09:34.575 --> 09:37.143
You were expressing your
own prideful ignorance.

09:37.144 --> 09:39.112
For your penance,
you will bring water

09:39.113 --> 09:41.047
to the workers with
young Martha there.

09:41.048 --> 09:43.583
While you're at it, call
the community to a meeting

09:43.584 --> 09:45.318
in the Chapter house
before vespers.

09:45.319 --> 09:47.320
I have an important
announcement to make.

10:08.943 --> 10:10.576
I want you back.

10:11.545 --> 10:13.112
I miss you so.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.114
Philip wouldn't be happy.

10:16.817 --> 10:18.851
He would if we were married.

10:18.852 --> 10:22.655
Why must the Church always
dictate how we live?

10:22.656 --> 10:24.524
Well, you know Philip.

10:24.525 --> 10:26.693
He worries about your soul.

10:26.694 --> 10:29.095
So, he can just stop worrying.

10:29.096 --> 10:30.897
And even if we did marry,

10:30.898 --> 10:33.733
it's no guarantee that
I won't be burned.

10:33.734 --> 10:35.868
I'm still an outlaw,
Tom Builder.

10:35.869 --> 10:38.237
- Well, I can't just...
- Stop. Enough.

10:43.911 --> 10:47.013
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

10:47.014 --> 10:49.449
I have sinned and confessed

10:49.450 --> 10:52.785
and done penance and
still God is punishing me.

10:52.786 --> 10:56.789
You forgave me and still
He is punishing me!

10:58.459 --> 11:00.560
In what way, My Lord?

11:01.962 --> 11:03.796
Rumors remain at court

11:03.797 --> 11:06.899
that the ship was
deliberately sunk,

11:06.900 --> 11:09.035
that I am not king.

11:10.304 --> 11:12.739
There will always
be rumors, Sire.

11:12.740 --> 11:14.774
The Archbishop
anointed you king.

11:14.775 --> 11:16.509
God is on your side.

11:16.510 --> 11:20.847
Then why hasn't He put Maud
and her bastard brother down?

11:20.848 --> 11:22.882
They're approaching
Lincoln now.

11:22.883 --> 11:24.917
If they take that city,

11:24.918 --> 11:28.254
they'll effectively
cut my kingdom in half.

11:28.255 --> 11:32.492
Why does God continually
turn His back upon my cause?

11:34.228 --> 11:36.863
I cannot answer for God,

11:36.864 --> 11:40.400
but perhaps it is not
you who displeases Him.

11:40.401 --> 11:42.802
There are others
in your kingdom.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.170
Others?

11:44.171 --> 11:45.671
Name them.

11:47.274 --> 11:49.475
There is a prior
in Kingsbridge.

11:49.476 --> 11:51.244
You met him once.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.983
Brother Milius, as purser,

11:56.984 --> 11:59.652
has begun a written account
of our finances.

11:59.653 --> 12:03.389
Our distant farms have been
leased for cash rents.

12:03.390 --> 12:04.924
Our sheep farming has improved.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.793
All thanks to you,
Prior Philip.

12:06.794 --> 12:09.862
I don't say this, Brother
Cuthbert, to garner praise,

12:09.863 --> 12:12.031
but to prepare you all
for the next phase

12:12.032 --> 12:13.332
of our economic revival.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.435
I wish to turn Kingsbridge

12:15.436 --> 12:17.103
into a market town.

12:17.104 --> 12:21.374
This will bring in visitors
and increase revenue for all.

12:21.375 --> 12:22.575
Ha!

12:22.576 --> 12:25.078
There will be no visitors

12:25.079 --> 12:27.880
without St. Adolphus'
skull to work miracles.

12:29.349 --> 12:30.683
Wasn't it lost in the fire?

12:32.186 --> 12:34.120
Prior Philip
rescued it from the fire,

12:34.121 --> 12:35.121
didn't you, Prior?

12:39.159 --> 12:41.160
Yes. Yes, I did.

12:42.930 --> 12:45.898
Why didn't you
tell us earlier, Prior?

12:45.899 --> 12:47.233
And where is it?

12:48.268 --> 12:49.869
I've put it in a safe place

12:49.870 --> 12:53.172
until a statue can be carved
to honor the saint.

12:54.374 --> 12:56.609
That could be years, Prior.

12:58.345 --> 13:01.013
Tom Builder has
commissioned a sculptor,

13:01.014 --> 13:03.149
who's working on it now.

13:19.566 --> 13:21.400
It's beautiful.

13:22.536 --> 13:23.936
Not yet.

13:23.937 --> 13:25.238
It is.

13:25.239 --> 13:27.573
You're very good.

13:27.574 --> 13:30.343
Alfred's wrong
to treat you badly.

13:35.849 --> 13:37.884
What?
What is it?

13:37.885 --> 13:39.952
Jack, I did something
I shouldn't have.

13:39.953 --> 13:43.156
I did it as a kindness,

13:43.157 --> 13:45.558
but I also did it for me too.

13:45.559 --> 13:46.926
What, Martha?

13:53.400 --> 13:54.834
Alfred wants you gone.

13:56.103 --> 13:58.604
You and your Ma
took Da away from us.

14:00.007 --> 14:01.607
That's what he says.

14:01.608 --> 14:04.510
Love's not a contest, Martha.

14:06.947 --> 14:09.482
Then why is there always
something to be won or lost?

14:34.308 --> 14:35.775
Let's try this one.

14:47.654 --> 14:50.656
Confession's in the morning,
unless you're willing to pay.

14:50.657 --> 14:52.858
Were you confessor
to Bartholomew of Shiring

14:52.859 --> 14:53.859
after his arrest?

14:57.030 --> 14:58.364
What if I was?

14:58.365 --> 15:01.934
I'm Richard, son of
Bartholomew, Earl of Shiring.

15:01.935 --> 15:03.736
Former earl.

15:04.805 --> 15:05.972
So what do you want?

15:05.973 --> 15:07.139
My father's money,

15:07.140 --> 15:08.541
50 bezants.

15:08.542 --> 15:11.410
I don't know what
you're talking about.

15:11.411 --> 15:14.780
He left money with you
for safekeeping.

15:14.781 --> 15:16.415
That's a lie.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.050
- You're the liar.
- Piss off.

15:18.051 --> 15:19.719
They cut off thieves' hands!

15:19.720 --> 15:20.953
I've seen it.

15:20.954 --> 15:22.588
It'll be my word
against the word

15:22.589 --> 15:23.856
of a dead traitor.

15:28.629 --> 15:31.764
You lying, thieving,
godless heathen!

15:32.899 --> 15:34.867
It's a sin to harm a priest!

15:34.868 --> 15:36.602
Not if he robs orphans.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.004
Richard, cut off his nose.

15:38.005 --> 15:40.806
No! No, no!
No, please! Please!

15:40.807 --> 15:43.142
Cut it off!
Where is the money?

15:43.143 --> 15:44.277
I swear, I... Altar.

15:44.278 --> 15:46.312
It's under the altar.

15:46.313 --> 15:48.881
Hold this.
If he moves, push hard.

16:14.975 --> 16:17.777
But there's only 10 here.
Where's the rest?

16:17.778 --> 16:19.612
It's gone.

16:19.613 --> 16:22.214
- Gone where?
- I spent it.

16:27.254 --> 16:29.121
Shall I kill him, Allie?

16:32.225 --> 16:34.160
Hell is too good for him.

16:35.429 --> 16:37.730
I may come back
and kill you one day.

16:40.734 --> 16:42.868
What can we buy
with 10 bezants?

16:44.137 --> 16:45.404
A horse and armor?

16:45.405 --> 16:47.340
We can barely buy
a stirrup with this.

16:47.341 --> 16:49.875
This is all the money
that we have in the world.

16:49.876 --> 16:51.677
We can't spend it
on food or lodging.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.446
Well, what can we
do with it then?

16:53.447 --> 16:55.247
Here,
I'll lift it for you.

16:55.248 --> 16:58.584
20 bags of fleece, 25 pounds.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.486
We can quintuple it.

17:04.257 --> 17:06.291
- You Otto Blackface?
- Yes.

17:06.292 --> 17:09.228
I'm Tom Builder.
You're working for me.

17:09.229 --> 17:12.631
That's my son, Alfred.
That's my stepson, Jack.

17:12.632 --> 17:14.133
These are my 4 sons,

17:14.134 --> 17:16.469
my cousin, my brother-in-law
and his two boys.

17:16.470 --> 17:18.637
So you've worked here before?

17:18.637 --> 17:20.539
I know the quarry.
It's good stone.

17:20.540 --> 17:21.874
Enough for two cathedrals.

17:21.875 --> 17:23.809
How will you get it
to Kingsbridge?

17:23.810 --> 17:25.111
By river, then by cart.

17:25.112 --> 17:26.878
Shouldn't be too difficult.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.614
Right. How soon
can you start?

17:28.615 --> 17:30.249
Oh, soon as you pay us.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.318
Shouldn't be too
difficult neither.

17:32.319 --> 17:34.487
Come on boys,
let's get to work.

17:54.007 --> 17:57.076
Who's in charge here?

17:57.077 --> 17:58.978
I am.

18:04.785 --> 18:06.685
I'm Tom of Kingsbridge.

18:06.686 --> 18:10.790
We'll be quarrying this stone
to build our new cathedral.

18:10.791 --> 18:12.892
This quarry
is owned by the earl.

18:12.893 --> 18:15.394
When the king gave
the quarry to the earl,

18:15.395 --> 18:18.097
he gave the priory
permission to use the stone.

18:18.098 --> 18:19.698
And I'm not to allow that.

18:19.699 --> 18:21.734
By whose orders?

18:21.735 --> 18:23.869
Byrders of the king.

18:23.870 --> 18:25.237
Guards.

18:30.544 --> 18:31.877
I know you.

18:33.046 --> 18:34.447
How do I know you?

18:34.448 --> 18:36.682
I was building you
a wedding house.

18:36.683 --> 18:38.684
Building it badly, if I recall.

18:38.685 --> 18:39.718
Walter?

18:39.719 --> 18:41.921
The king has rescinded
his permission

18:41.922 --> 18:43.789
for you to quarry stone.

18:43.790 --> 18:46.792
Now turn around and go home

18:46.793 --> 18:48.327
or you're all dead men.

18:48.328 --> 18:50.663
What proof have you got

18:50.664 --> 18:51.997
the order's been rescinded?

18:51.998 --> 18:54.467
My soldiers are proof enough.

18:54.468 --> 18:55.901
They'll die before you.

18:55.902 --> 18:57.570
They'll take their chances.

18:57.571 --> 19:01.207
If you attack us,
you attack the throne and God.

19:01.208 --> 19:04.944
Kill us and you burn
in hell's everlasting fire!

19:21.094 --> 19:22.328
Excellent idea.

19:23.830 --> 19:26.899
What would you say to a duel?

19:28.435 --> 19:31.470
One of your men armed
with a mason's hammer...

19:32.472 --> 19:34.406
against Walter.

19:34.407 --> 19:36.542
Walter will fight
without a weapon.

19:36.543 --> 19:39.678
I think I'll take
my chances with the king,

19:39.679 --> 19:41.514
thank you very much.

19:41.515 --> 19:43.983
It'll be months before
he hears your claim,

19:43.984 --> 19:46.318
and I have the bishop's
word he'll deny it.

19:48.355 --> 19:50.723
God wants a
Kingsbridge Cathedral.

19:50.724 --> 19:52.892
Then why did God burn it?

19:57.330 --> 19:59.131
I'll fight.

19:59.132 --> 20:02.368
What are the rules?
Jack, I forbid it.

20:02.369 --> 20:04.904
We lose the quarry,
we lose the cathedral.

20:04.905 --> 20:07.840
First one to cry out
with pain, loses.

20:07.841 --> 20:09.041
And the winner?

20:09.042 --> 20:10.109
The quarry's his.

20:11.144 --> 20:12.578
This is foolishness, Jack.

20:12.579 --> 20:14.613
I don't trust these people.

20:14.614 --> 20:16.849
I won't go back
to who I was, Tom.

20:30.730 --> 20:31.897
Yah!

20:38.972 --> 20:40.873
Stay back.

21:16.776 --> 21:17.977
Ah!

21:34.961 --> 21:36.395
NO!

21:36.396 --> 21:38.497
He needs to cry out, not you.

21:39.766 --> 21:42.568
Don't murder him, Walter.

21:42.569 --> 21:44.637
Break something instead.

21:48.942 --> 21:50.509
What... What...

22:02.322 --> 22:05.324
Outrageous! First they cheat
us of ownership of the quarry,

22:05.325 --> 22:06.892
now they cheat us of the stone.

22:06.893 --> 22:08.494
Send a deputation to the king

22:08.495 --> 22:10.295
and ask him to
enforce the charter.

22:10.296 --> 22:12.297
Who's to say he won't
side with Percy?

22:12.298 --> 22:15.234
He has soldiers which the king
needs more than a cathedral.

22:15.235 --> 22:16.335
What can we do then?

22:16.336 --> 22:18.103
Is there any way
to continue work

22:18.104 --> 22:19.071
without the stone?

22:19.072 --> 22:20.472
No.

22:40.193 --> 22:42.227
Is it broken?

22:42.228 --> 22:43.862
Yes, I'm afraid so.

22:45.732 --> 22:48.067
You mustn't use it,
not for a month at least.

22:48.068 --> 22:49.068
The statue.

22:49.069 --> 22:51.003
- That can wait.
- No, it can't.

22:51.004 --> 22:52.971
Then you'll be
crippled for life.

22:52.972 --> 22:54.873
Hold still.

23:03.483 --> 23:05.384
Do you wish to come home, Jack?

23:05.385 --> 23:06.852
Say it.

23:06.853 --> 23:08.620
Is this too much for you?

23:09.989 --> 23:14.026
I'm hungry, Ma,
but the food's not here.

23:18.865 --> 23:21.166
The night you were born,
I had a dream.

23:21.167 --> 23:23.836
In a room full of darkness,
you opened a box...

23:23.837 --> 23:26.438
Filled with light.
It doesn't mean anything, Ma.

23:26.439 --> 23:27.873
I never told you all of it.

23:29.209 --> 23:31.744
The room you were in
was a grave,

23:31.745 --> 23:34.213
filled with hundreds
and hundreds of dead.

23:34.214 --> 23:37.149
English soldiers,
workers, kings.

23:37.150 --> 23:38.784
We all must die, Ma.

23:38.785 --> 23:40.352
But not so young.

23:40.353 --> 23:41.720
You were so young.

23:41.721 --> 23:43.756
Scarcely older
than you are now.

23:43.757 --> 23:46.158
I fear for you, Jack.

23:52.766 --> 23:54.533
How much do you get?

23:54.534 --> 23:56.468
What?

23:56.469 --> 23:57.936
For a fleece, how much?

23:57.937 --> 23:59.071
A penny.

23:59.072 --> 24:00.606
At the market in Winchester?

24:00.607 --> 24:02.207
Aye.

24:02.208 --> 24:04.510
Come along, Allie.
We need to find food.

24:04.511 --> 24:06.378
It's a day's walk
to Winchester.

24:06.379 --> 24:08.013
You lose two days in the field.

24:08.014 --> 24:09.314
What choice do I have?

24:10.884 --> 24:12.985
You can sell the fleece to me.

24:12.986 --> 24:15.120
<i>- We don't need wool!
- Tais-toi!</i>

24:15.121 --> 24:16.221
What's the snag?

24:16.222 --> 24:19.124
I can only give you
2 pence for 4.

24:19.125 --> 24:20.559
That's not worth it.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.394
3 pence then.

24:23.396 --> 24:24.530
I'd lose a penny.

24:24.531 --> 24:26.365
- And save a
two-day journey.

24:26.366 --> 24:29.434
I never heard of
nothing like this before.

24:29.435 --> 24:32.638
Is an extra two days
worth a penny to you or not?

24:36.776 --> 24:39.077
What are we to do
with 4 fleeces?

24:39.078 --> 24:41.647
Take them to Winchester
and sell them.

24:41.648 --> 24:44.116
For a penny profit?
That's nothing!

24:44.117 --> 24:47.252
Not if we buy wool
from 50 peasants, Richard.

24:47.253 --> 24:50.322
It will set us on our path
to hors d armor.

25:02.068 --> 25:03.702
- Tom.
- Brother?

25:03.703 --> 25:05.370
I have a plan.

25:05.371 --> 25:08.073
I don't know whether it'll
work, but it's worth a try.

25:08.074 --> 25:12.177
Have your men ready to leave
at midnight tomorrow night.

25:12.178 --> 25:13.478
Midnight?

25:13.479 --> 25:16.381
Our enemies are weakest
in the dark.

25:23.323 --> 25:25.457
How long till sunrise?

25:27.093 --> 25:28.560
Minutes.

26:56.516 --> 26:58.650
Shut your mouth, priest.

27:00.787 --> 27:02.020
Shut up!

27:34.620 --> 27:36.955
It's a sign from God.

27:36.956 --> 27:38.490
Thank the Lord!

27:38.491 --> 27:39.891
Kneel, kneel.

27:39.892 --> 27:41.593
Praise be to God.

27:41.594 --> 27:42.995
It's a miracle.

27:44.263 --> 27:45.731
This is God's work,

27:47.166 --> 27:49.568
and this is God's will.

27:50.903 --> 27:53.405
I intend to hire
all quarry workers

27:53.406 --> 27:55.474
at the standard rate

27:55.475 --> 27:59.044
and I grant you all
plenary indulgences

27:59.045 --> 28:01.613
for laboring on our cathedral.

28:01.614 --> 28:02.714
What say you?

28:02.715 --> 28:04.282
Praise God!

28:04.283 --> 28:06.284
Praise God!

28:52.732 --> 28:55.233
This stone's
for the foundation.

29:11.517 --> 29:14.119
Come on, a bit more.
Higher than that!

29:16.122 --> 29:18.723
The wool's ready
for market, Prior.

29:18.724 --> 29:20.659
Oh, good.
Leave it here.

29:20.660 --> 29:21.760
Here. Thank you.

29:33.873 --> 29:36.608
Occasional defeats
are to be expected in war.

29:39.245 --> 29:42.314
They make our victories
all the sweeter.

29:47.320 --> 29:48.687
I'll burn, Mother.

29:48.688 --> 29:50.322
What?

29:50.323 --> 29:51.756
In hell.

29:53.659 --> 29:54.860
You told me that.

29:56.829 --> 29:58.897
Nonsense.

29:58.898 --> 30:02.200
God is on our side.

30:03.836 --> 30:05.837
Not according to that priest.

30:05.838 --> 30:08.306
Well, you're to
pay him no mind.

30:08.307 --> 30:10.675
His motives are
entirely selfish.

30:15.314 --> 30:16.615
Now tell me...

30:18.151 --> 30:22.454
Whom do you hate the most?

30:25.691 --> 30:26.925
Prior Philip.

30:26.926 --> 30:28.360
Hmm...

30:28.361 --> 30:30.529
And what would you do to him?

30:30.530 --> 30:32.130
Cut out his heart...

30:32.131 --> 30:33.465
- Mm-hmm.

30:33.466 --> 30:36.034
...and roast it on
a spit and eat it.

30:36.035 --> 30:38.770
Mmm! And so you shall.

30:45.044 --> 30:47.712
And who do you love the most?

30:50.116 --> 30:51.116
You.

30:53.486 --> 30:55.520
And what would you do to me?

31:00.092 --> 31:03.628
Smile, sweet William.

31:08.301 --> 31:09.334
Yes, Walter?

31:09.335 --> 31:11.436
Bishop Waleran is here, Milady.

31:14.140 --> 31:17.676
Some months ago, you induced
the Prior of Kingsbridge

31:17.677 --> 31:18.944
to double-cross me.

31:18.945 --> 31:20.946
You never keep your promises.

31:20.947 --> 31:22.614
I delivered you Shiring.

31:22.615 --> 31:24.282
Past promises, remember?

31:25.718 --> 31:28.753
I have no idea, dear lady,
what you're talking about,

31:28.754 --> 31:30.422
but that is beside the point.

31:30.423 --> 31:33.725
The prior, it seems,
has outwitted us both.

31:33.726 --> 31:36.061
Well, for all
his saintly innocence

31:36.062 --> 31:38.296
he's got the cunning
of a political rat.

31:38.297 --> 31:41.499
Rats can be easily dealt with
once one finds their nest.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.668
And his is...

31:43.669 --> 31:45.971
In Kingsbridge.
What of it?

31:47.306 --> 31:51.142
Perhaps the cathedral should
be built somewhere else?

31:51.143 --> 31:52.143
What?

31:53.613 --> 31:56.414
Kingsbridge is a village in
the middle of nowhere, Percy.

31:56.415 --> 31:58.850
It isn't rich enough
to maintain a cathedral,

31:58.851 --> 31:59.951
let alone build one.

31:59.952 --> 32:03.221
It needs to develop
a market and pilgrims.

32:04.257 --> 32:06.124
We could build it in Shiring.

32:06.125 --> 32:09.427
You have a market,
an annual fleece fair

32:09.428 --> 32:11.563
and you're on the main road.

32:11.564 --> 32:14.633
Well, if the cathedral was
here, who's gonna pay for it?

32:14.634 --> 32:16.901
I hope you don't
expect me to...

32:16.902 --> 32:20.505
If the cathedral moves, the

32:20.506 --> 32:23.942
the farms, the sheep-folds,
all the income they produce.

32:23.943 --> 32:26.378
Kingsbridge becomes fallow

32:26.379 --> 32:28.313
and the rat,
a castrated field mouse.

32:30.650 --> 32:31.750
Excellent.

32:31.751 --> 32:34.552
So, how do we do it?

32:34.553 --> 32:37.589
We can do nothing
without the king's approval.

32:37.590 --> 32:39.724
- What do we tell him?
- We don't.

32:39.725 --> 32:41.993
We show him what
little progress

32:41.994 --> 32:44.396
is being made in Kingsbridge.

32:44.397 --> 32:45.797
How?

32:45.798 --> 32:48.300
The feast of Adolphus
is coming up, their patron.

32:50.670 --> 32:52.871
The King is very
fond of Adolphus.

32:52.872 --> 32:54.673
I'll organize a pilgrimage.

32:54.674 --> 32:56.207
Hmm...

32:58.577 --> 32:59.878
Oy! Oy! Oy! Oy!

33:00.880 --> 33:02.314
Tamp down your fires!

33:04.850 --> 33:07.018
Oy! Oy! Oy! Oy!

33:07.019 --> 33:09.220
Tamp down your fires!

33:15.795 --> 33:17.228
The past.

33:17.229 --> 33:18.296
Go away.

33:18.297 --> 33:19.431
Leave me.

33:19.432 --> 33:22.634
<i>What I did,
I did for God's glory.</i>

33:22.635 --> 33:25.470
You shall rule for ill or good,

33:25.471 --> 33:28.640
till saintly skulls
weep tears of blood.

33:31.210 --> 33:33.478
I'll rule forever then.

33:33.479 --> 33:34.846
How long until the war ends?

33:36.449 --> 33:39.250
Let peace survive
and war depart,

33:39.251 --> 33:41.853
when arrows pierce
my daughter's heart.

33:46.392 --> 33:47.992
Name my greatest enemy.

33:49.462 --> 33:50.729
Whose hair of flame?

33:50.730 --> 33:52.664
An artist boy's.

33:52.665 --> 33:55.100
<i>One king he crowns,</i>

33:55.101 --> 33:57.736
one king destroys.

34:09.281 --> 34:11.649
Roast chicken! Roast chicken!

34:11.650 --> 34:13.551
Meat, Allie.
We'll have meat tonight.

34:13.552 --> 34:14.853
We'll have more than meat.

34:14.853 --> 34:16.688
We'll have at least
a pound of silver.

34:16.688 --> 34:18.089
Look at the crowd, Richard!

34:18.090 --> 34:20.658
There are fairs everywhere
throughout the summer.

34:20.659 --> 34:23.460
We can get another
sack full, and another,

34:23.462 --> 34:25.330
and by the summer's end...

34:25.331 --> 34:27.732
It's a full sack,
but the quality's poor.

34:27.733 --> 34:29.868
I'll give you
a pound. Agreed?

34:31.504 --> 34:32.536
Hands.

34:37.610 --> 34:38.743
One sack?

34:38.744 --> 34:39.978
Yes.

34:39.978 --> 34:41.880
Half a pound now!

34:42.915 --> 34:44.014
Hmm...

34:44.016 --> 34:46.317
Mixed quality.
Half a pound.

34:46.318 --> 34:48.420
What? You gave
a full pound for a sack

34:48.420 --> 34:49.420
of poor quality.

34:49.422 --> 34:50.989
Half a pound.
That's my offer.

34:50.989 --> 34:53.358
This is better wool!
You said it!

34:53.359 --> 34:54.525
Take it or leave it.

34:54.527 --> 34:56.327
Give me what
you gave those men!

34:56.328 --> 34:58.363
- No.
- Why?

34:58.364 --> 35:01.232
Because nobody pays a girl
what they pay a man.

35:02.201 --> 35:03.301
Unless...

35:03.302 --> 35:05.203
Look, I'm doing you
a favor here.

35:05.204 --> 35:08.273
Nobody will pay you
what I'm willing to pay you.

35:08.274 --> 35:09.407
Go and ask. Next!

35:09.408 --> 35:11.376
How many sacks, boy?

35:12.445 --> 35:14.245
Boy, how many sacks?

35:14.246 --> 35:15.313
Eleven.

35:16.382 --> 35:17.782
Unload them, Jack.

35:25.291 --> 35:27.826
11.5 pounds of silver
and 12 pennies.

35:27.827 --> 35:31.095
You didn't test it!
You didn't even check the bags!

35:31.096 --> 35:33.131
He's a monk.
I'll take his word for it.

35:33.132 --> 35:36.234
Wait! There's only 10.
There's only 10 sacks!

35:36.235 --> 35:38.169
There are 10 on the cart, yes.

35:38.170 --> 35:39.304
That's the 1h.

35:39.305 --> 35:40.672
Oh! No, no!

35:40.673 --> 35:43.541
I've already agreed to pay her
half a pound for this one.

35:43.542 --> 35:45.276
But I'm buying it instead.

35:45.277 --> 35:49.047
You told her to ask if any
other merchants were interested,

35:49.048 --> 35:50.582
and I am,

35:50.583 --> 35:52.183
and I'll pay her a pound...

35:55.254 --> 35:56.488
...if that suits you?

35:58.023 --> 35:59.691
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

36:04.897 --> 36:08.266
Last I saw you, you were
still at Shiring Castle.

36:08.267 --> 36:11.236
I told the Hamleighs
to keep watch over you.

36:11.237 --> 36:13.304
God forgive you for that.

36:14.740 --> 36:15.907
What happened?

36:17.209 --> 36:20.278
Let's just say that
they were less than kind.

36:20.279 --> 36:22.447
Oh, I, uh...

36:22.448 --> 36:24.215
I'm sorry.

36:24.216 --> 36:27.819
Any misfortune
that came your way, I...

36:31.724 --> 36:33.224
I, uh... Oh, here.

36:36.395 --> 36:38.863
Come and visit us
at the end of the month.

36:38.864 --> 36:40.965
There's to be a fair
at Kingsbridge

36:40.966 --> 36:42.467
in honor of St. Adolphus.

36:42.468 --> 36:44.435
Bring more fleece.
You'll do well there.

36:44.436 --> 36:47.338
Perhaps we will.
I'm sorry, I forgot...

36:47.339 --> 36:48.840
Philip. This is Jack.

36:48.841 --> 36:50.208
Works for me.

36:50.209 --> 36:51.876
Milady.

36:56.549 --> 36:58.016
Have we met before?

37:01.053 --> 37:02.520
Come along, Richard.

37:02.521 --> 37:06.291
Thank you, Prior Philip,
from the bottom of our hearts.

37:06.292 --> 37:07.659
We need a protector.

37:07.660 --> 37:09.427
You have two now.

37:09.428 --> 37:11.462
God and me!

37:13.098 --> 37:14.799
And me.

37:16.101 --> 37:17.302
You have me.

37:24.243 --> 37:25.910
- Go away!
- Let me kiss you!

37:32.217 --> 37:34.252
Pray with me, Jack.
Would you?

37:43.963 --> 37:48.032
You remind me a little
of myself at your age.

38:00.679 --> 38:02.113
Yum!

38:22.468 --> 38:25.737
Want to fuck, boy? Hmm?

38:54.400 --> 38:55.600
Oh! I'm sorry.

38:58.037 --> 38:59.070
Milady.

38:59.071 --> 39:00.538
- Mm-hmm?

39:00.539 --> 39:02.373
I'm sorry, I...

39:02.374 --> 39:03.975
Milady?
Aren't you polite?

39:03.976 --> 39:06.344
Sorry, I thought
you were someone else.

39:06.345 --> 39:08.579
Do these make you
weak in the knees?

39:10.015 --> 39:11.749
Can I... can I sketch you?

39:11.750 --> 39:14.786
Oh! Well, I've never heard it
called that before, but...

39:21.460 --> 39:22.927
Come again soon.

39:28.267 --> 39:30.334
Pity, poor Kingsbridge!

39:30.335 --> 39:32.303
The king comes at
the end of the month.

39:32.304 --> 39:35.073
When he sees what piss-poor,
little work they've done,

39:35.074 --> 39:37.975
he'll move the cathedral
to Shiring!

39:39.144 --> 39:41.345
Good for you, Percy.

39:43.415 --> 39:47.118
In 10 days' time, as you know,

39:47.119 --> 39:49.220
we celebrate the feast
of St. Adolphus.

39:49.221 --> 39:50.655
We have received word

39:50.656 --> 39:53.124
that King Stephen
will be visiting us.

39:53.125 --> 39:56.427
We need to show the king
how devoted this parish is to

39:56.428 --> 39:58.062
the building of
our new cathedral.

39:58.063 --> 40:01.165
So instead of singing hymns
and saying prayers,

40:01.166 --> 40:04.969
we will dig, carry and build.

40:10.242 --> 40:13.544
God and his saints will
bless you for your generosity.

40:13.545 --> 40:14.946
Wasting my time!

40:14.947 --> 40:16.948
I can't finish it.
Not in time.

40:16.949 --> 40:18.916
We need it to draw the crowd.

40:18.917 --> 40:20.818
But it won't be perfect, Tom.

40:20.819 --> 40:22.386
You can perfect it later.

40:25.624 --> 40:28.326
Look, I know that
you all work long hours,

40:28.327 --> 40:31.796
and I know how much
you have given already,

40:31.797 --> 40:36.100
and now God is asking
you to give more.

40:39.838 --> 40:43.808
Our cathedral, this cathedral,

40:43.809 --> 40:47.645
is more than just stone
and wood and mud!

40:47.646 --> 40:49.747
<i>It takes the earth
with all its heaviness</i>

40:49.748 --> 40:53.484
<i>and transforms it
into possibility,</i>

40:53.485 --> 40:54.886
reaching for the light,

40:54.887 --> 40:56.654
which is hope, which is God!

41:03.962 --> 41:07.231
It is... it is Hope's fragile
shell on Earth, and if we...

41:07.232 --> 41:10.701
if we can give God
a beautiful home,

41:10.702 --> 41:13.437
then it will burst its shell
and it will prosper,

41:13.438 --> 41:15.606
and you all will be
the better for it.

41:15.607 --> 41:17.642
Your children will be
the better for it!

41:20.612 --> 41:21.946
If...

41:25.784 --> 41:27.285
Right.

41:27.286 --> 41:30.121
I will give you bread and ale

41:30.122 --> 41:31.856
and absolution
for all your sins

41:31.857 --> 41:33.591
in exchange for
one day's labor.

41:34.660 --> 41:35.860
One day's labor!

41:35.861 --> 41:37.261
What say you?

41:51.276 --> 41:53.077
Forgive me, St. Adolphus.

42:21.840 --> 42:24.508
I begged for help
in all the villages.

42:26.678 --> 42:28.246
Don't they want their church?

42:28.247 --> 42:30.114
They know that
without their help,

42:30.115 --> 42:32.149
there'll be no
Kingsbridge Cathedral.

42:35.153 --> 42:36.254
They'll come.

42:39.057 --> 42:40.458
Bound to come.

42:40.459 --> 42:42.593
Dozens, perhaps.
Not hundreds.

42:42.594 --> 42:44.195
Word will have spread.

42:44.196 --> 42:46.030
The King will look
at this and laugh.

43:00.479 --> 43:02.280
There's someone now.

43:08.787 --> 43:10.855
<i>Greetings, frÃ¨re Prior.</i>

43:10.856 --> 43:12.323
Welcome, My Lady.

43:12.324 --> 43:14.692
Ah, no longer a lady.
We've brought fleece.

43:14.693 --> 43:17.695
May God grant us
customers to buy it.

43:17.696 --> 43:20.898
Ah, Jack, will you kindly
stable My Lady's donkey.

43:24.603 --> 43:26.003
When does the king arrive?

43:26.004 --> 43:27.905
Shortly, I fear.

43:30.742 --> 43:32.710
How much further, dammit?

43:32.711 --> 43:34.679
My piles are murdering me.

43:34.680 --> 43:36.747
We've been riding all morning.

43:45.057 --> 43:47.325
You were with him
in Winchester?

43:49.194 --> 43:50.861
But we've met before.

43:50.862 --> 43:52.830
In Shiring, Milady.

43:52.831 --> 43:54.198
You're the artist.

43:54.199 --> 43:56.934
Quite gifted,
if I remember correctly.

43:58.303 --> 44:00.838
What did you do to your hand?

44:00.839 --> 44:01.839
Oh.

44:02.808 --> 44:04.275
I... I injured it.

44:04.276 --> 44:05.876
I wasn't supposed to use it,

44:05.877 --> 44:09.113
but I had a sculpture I had
to finish for today, so...

44:10.349 --> 44:11.682
Aliena?

44:11.683 --> 44:13.617
I thought it was you!

44:13.618 --> 44:14.819
Martha, yes?

44:14.820 --> 44:17.188
That's right.
And you remember Alfred.

44:17.189 --> 44:18.723
My Lady.

44:18.724 --> 44:20.191
Call me Aliena.
I prefer it.

44:20.192 --> 44:22.426
You'll never guess
what's happened to us!

44:22.427 --> 44:27.131
Da brought us here and
the church burned and Ellen...

44:27.132 --> 44:28.165
You remember Ellen?

44:28.166 --> 44:29.934
She was almost
killed as a witch!

44:29.935 --> 44:32.870
And now the king
is coming to see Da's work.

44:32.871 --> 44:35.740
And if he likes it, then Da can
build the whole cathedral.

44:35.741 --> 44:37.608
No one's come to help us yet.

44:37.609 --> 44:38.909
But we hope that...

44:38.910 --> 44:41.078
We pray the king is
in a gracious mood...

44:41.079 --> 44:43.214
- Hmm.
- ...Aliena.

44:53.792 --> 44:55.726
Brother Johnny?

44:55.727 --> 44:59.230
Don't climb that high.
Not with the baby!

44:59.231 --> 45:00.731
Johnny, listen to me.
Come down!

45:00.732 --> 45:02.600
No, no!
You must come up!

45:02.601 --> 45:04.869
This is an order!
I want you to come down!

45:04.870 --> 45:06.637
Get him down, now!

45:06.638 --> 45:07.938
What's he doing?

45:07.939 --> 45:10.341
- He'll harm the child!
- Come down!

45:10.342 --> 45:13.677
- Philip, it won't hold!
- Johnny, listen to me.

45:13.678 --> 45:17.081
Johnny, listen to me very
carefully. Give me the baby.

45:17.082 --> 45:18.816
Look! It's a miracle!

45:22.854 --> 45:24.255
Oh, we're saved!

45:25.690 --> 45:26.824
We're saved!

45:26.825 --> 45:28.559
Come and look!

45:28.560 --> 45:31.462
Praise God
and Prior Phillip!

45:31.463 --> 45:34.165
It's a miracle!
We're saved!

46:06.264 --> 46:08.165
Alms for the blind?

46:08.166 --> 46:10.334
Not now, woman.
I'm working.

46:10.335 --> 46:11.535
Hey!

46:13.171 --> 46:15.272
What are you doing here?

46:29.855 --> 46:32.556
The king!
The king has come!

46:37.262 --> 46:38.529
The king.

46:38.530 --> 46:39.697
It's the king.

46:39.698 --> 46:41.065
Where were you?

46:41.066 --> 46:42.600
The king's here.

47:04.122 --> 47:07.191
Kneel.
Bow down to His Majesty.

47:17.402 --> 47:19.069
Who's in charge here?

47:21.339 --> 47:23.174
I am, Your Majesty.

47:28.747 --> 47:30.347
Where are the plans?

47:30.348 --> 47:32.116
This way, Your Majesty.

47:51.136 --> 47:53.404
Where's the door?

47:55.173 --> 47:57.174
Um, Your Majesty,

47:57.175 --> 47:58.642
this is the doorway.

48:00.679 --> 48:03.681
This is the, uh, nave.

48:03.682 --> 48:05.149
Show me.

48:41.786 --> 48:43.254
Very good.

48:43.255 --> 48:47.091
I look forward to visiting again
when the church is completed.

48:47.092 --> 48:48.459
What did he say?

48:48.460 --> 48:49.727
Shut up, Percy.

48:49.728 --> 48:52.763
But where is the statue
of St. Adolphus?

48:54.199 --> 48:55.666
Oh, I forgot.

48:55.667 --> 48:58.168
It was destroyed in a fire,
wasn't it, Prior?

48:59.704 --> 49:00.853
It's here, Your Majesty.

50:18.584 --> 50:21.072
You shall rule for ill or good,

50:21.345 --> 50:24.625
till saintly skulls
weep tears of blood.

50:33.652 --> 50:36.123
Your Majesty, I bring you news
from the battlefield.

50:36.243 --> 50:39.201
Lord and Gloucester have attacked
your army at Lincoln.

50:39.461 --> 50:42.277
And an arrow has pierced her armor.

50:42.397 --> 50:45.024
Let peace survive and war depart

50:45.144 --> 50:47.838
when arrows pierce my daughter's heart...

50:47.864 --> 50:49.081
- Is she dead?
- No.

50:49.470 --> 50:50.713
She survived.

50:51.123 --> 50:54.858
Her army took it as a sign of God
and your forces were defeated.

50:59.231 --> 51:02.200
Whose hair of flame??
An artist boy's

51:02.320 --> 51:06.724
One king he crowns,
one king destroys.

51:16.070 --> 51:17.614
Stay where you are.

51:30.173 --> 51:40.173
