Did you just call that guy Grandpa?

00:21.563 --> 00:25.025
[Luffy] Hoist the yard!
Batten down the hatches!

00:25.025 --> 00:27.318
Raise the mizzenmast, men!

00:28.111 --> 00:29.112
Prepare to board.

00:30.655 --> 00:32.323
Our ship is ready to sail.

00:32.949 --> 00:34.659
[Garp] What's the meaning of this?

00:35.994 --> 00:38.204
Grandpa, it's my first ship.

00:38.747 --> 00:41.791
How do you expect to be a Marine
when you're wasting your time on this?

00:42.375 --> 00:43.793
I don't want to be a Marine.

Stop! It's my ship!

Everybody okay?

01:34.928 --> 01:35.845
I think so.

01:36.513 --> 01:39.599
No. Not okay. Not even close to okay.

01:41.309 --> 01:43.561
Usopp, fire back at them!

01:43.561 --> 01:46.648
Or how about we sail away
as fast as we can?

01:47.690 --> 01:48.942
Run from the Marines?

01:49.901 --> 01:50.819
No. Never!

01:50.819 --> 01:54.155
Nami, trim the... the sail thing.
Let's sink their ship.

01:54.155 --> 01:56.574
[Nami] We don't have time.
They're stealing our wind.

01:56.574 --> 01:58.660
If they pull up alongside us,
we're finished.

01:58.660 --> 02:04.666
- You're the navigator. Do something.
- Zoro, sheet in and hard to port!

02:06.167 --> 02:08.128
- You know how to load a cannon?
- Yeah, of course.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.504
I've loaded thousands of 'em.

02:09.504 --> 02:12.298
Uh, this must be a different model
than I'm used to.

02:12.298 --> 02:14.509
- Which way is port?
- [Nami] The left!

02:14.509 --> 02:17.720
Usopp, load the cannon in the barrel.
Light the fuse.

02:17.720 --> 02:19.430
Then get the hell out of the way!

Ooh!

Oh man.

We've got a clear view of their hull, sir.
Permission to fire?

02:42.245 --> 02:43.955
No kill shots.

02:43.955 --> 02:46.207
I want these pirates taken alive.

Give me that.

- You didn't tell me you could do that.

- Broken railing.

Minor damage. Could've been a lot worse.

- Could've been better.
- Can't see the Marines anywhere.

04:50.331 --> 04:52.083
[Nami] Can't see anything in this soup.

What we need is a place to lay low,

wait out any reinforcements
they send after us.

My charts are useless in this fog.

04:58.881 --> 04:59.924
What did Luffy say?

04:59.924 --> 05:02.927
He's on the bow. He hasn't said anything
since we hightailed it.

05:02.927 --> 05:07.056
Well, somebody needs to talk to him.
About this and that other thing.

05:08.683 --> 05:11.060
- What other thing?
- Oh, gee, I wonder.

is-my-grandfather thing.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.191
[Usopp] Oh, that.

05:17.191 --> 05:19.736
Yeah, I don't really
know the guy that well.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.529
Doesn't seem like a big deal.

05:23.072 --> 05:27.118
You're his first mate. Kind of seems like
that falls under your job description,

05:27.118 --> 05:28.036
hmm?

05:31.914 --> 05:32.749
Fine.

Hey, how you doing?

05:48.348 --> 05:51.851
Great. But my hat took a couple of hits
during the battle.

05:53.144 --> 05:53.978
[Zoro] Right.

05:55.021 --> 05:57.065
About the battle, you wanna talk about it?

05:57.065 --> 05:58.066
Nope.

05:58.566 --> 06:00.026
Okay, good talk.

06:02.236 --> 06:03.446
He seems fine to me.

06:04.113 --> 06:05.281
Did you even ask him?

Hey!

[sniffs]

06:08.951 --> 06:10.161
You guys smell that?

06:12.455 --> 06:13.498
[Nami] Smell what?

There's something on the breeze.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.169

Smells like butter.

Soy sauce.

And meat.

06:30.139 --> 06:31.641
I can't smell anything.

06:31.641 --> 06:34.394
- Think he has brain damage?
- I think that every day.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.729
Look, Luffy,
playing follow the smell is fun and all,

06:36.729 --> 06:39.273
but we really got to get out of this fog.

06:39.273 --> 06:41.401
I know, but I smell food,

06:41.984 --> 06:45.905
which means that there's
someone somewhere cooking.

06:47.323 --> 06:48.324
[sniffing]

06:55.790 --> 06:57.208
Five degrees starboard!

06:58.501 --> 07:01.254
No! No! Three degrees back to port.

07:01.254 --> 07:04.590
Add food to the equation
and suddenly he knows how to navigate.

07:04.590 --> 07:05.508
What is that?

07:06.968 --> 07:08.010
Is that land?

07:08.010 --> 07:10.680
[Nami] Can't be. There aren't any Islands
anywhere near here.

That smell.
I think this place is a restaurant.

08:01.981 --> 08:03.900
Then I know what we're gonna do next.

08:03.900 --> 08:06.027
Disguise the ship
so the Marines can't find us?

08:06.027 --> 08:08.070
Sail back to Syrup Village
where it's safe?

08:08.070 --> 08:09.155
Nah.

08:09.155 --> 08:10.323
Let's eat!

08:21.042 --> 08:23.669
Welcome to Baratie. How can I help you?

08:23.669 --> 08:27.548
- Hi! Where do we eat?
- Do you have a reservation, sir?

08:27.548 --> 08:30.885
- Do we need one?
- We're very full today.

08:30.885 --> 08:34.430
I could put you on the waiting list.
It's three weeks out.

08:35.973 --> 08:38.017
Maybe you want to check your book again.

08:38.017 --> 08:40.937
You wouldn't want to turn away
the future King of the Pirates, would you?

08:40.937 --> 08:42.313
And who is that, sir?

08:42.313 --> 08:44.065
[Usopp] Monkey D. Luffy.

08:45.107 --> 08:46.651
Perhaps you've heard of him?

08:47.944 --> 08:50.071
Well, in that case, we'll find a table.

08:50.071 --> 08:51.364
Yeah! I knew it.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.199
In three weeks.

08:55.117 --> 08:57.703
You'll have to excuse them.
They're idiots.

08:58.788 --> 08:59.664
Of course.

09:00.998 --> 09:04.544
- Right this way, ma'am.
- See? Works every time.

09:12.635 --> 09:13.469
Ah!

I'd be happy
to check your swords for you, sir.

I got this.

09:30.152 --> 09:31.153
[host] Very good.

09:36.242 --> 09:40.580
Here are your menus.
Your waiter will be with you shortly.

09:43.082 --> 09:45.209
I wonder what kind of food they have here.

10:08.107 --> 10:11.110
- Get a move on. You're slowing the line.
- Gotta wait for the sauce to cool.

10:11.110 --> 10:13.863
- I didn't see this on tonight's menu.
- It's called imagination, Patty.

10:13.863 --> 10:16.490
- Wouldn't expect you to understand.
- Wanna take this outside?

10:16.490 --> 10:17.742
Are you asking me to dance?

10:17.742 --> 10:20.661
'Cause I kind of had
my eye on that blonde at table eight.

10:20.661 --> 10:22.288
You better keep your eye on the menu.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.957
Whatever the hell that is,
boss man ain't gonna like it.

10:24.957 --> 10:25.875
Order up!

10:27.501 --> 10:28.586
Aye, aye, aye, aye.

10:30.087 --> 10:33.382
- What the hell is this?
- I call it a True Bluefin Sauté.

10:33.382 --> 10:37.219
It's elephant tuna, seared asparagus,
in a sweet soy reduction.

10:37.219 --> 10:38.721
- [chuckles] Is that so?
- [chef] Yeah.

10:38.721 --> 10:40.139
Well, I call it crap.

10:40.139 --> 10:42.767
The day Baratie serves a dish like that,
little eggplant,

10:42.767 --> 10:44.852
is the day that hell freezes over.

10:44.852 --> 10:46.854
If I gotta sling
one more prime rib medium-well,

10:46.854 --> 10:50.107
I am going to drop dead of boredom,
you old shitbag!

10:50.107 --> 10:52.652
- It's what we serve.
- It's an insult to the meat.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.278
You don't like cooking our menu? Fine.

10:54.278 --> 10:57.198
'Cause I'll be more than delighted
to give you other work elsewhere.

10:57.198 --> 10:59.659
In fact, you are off the line.

11:00.242 --> 11:03.204
Now get out there and wait tables. Move!

11:06.207 --> 11:09.502
[man] I am saying, this here is my table.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.046
Close to the kitchen
so I can smell the beef.

11:12.046 --> 11:16.509
Maybe you ought to try a table outside.
Right now, the only thing I smell is you.

11:17.009 --> 11:19.804
- [man yells]
- [chef] Now, now, gentlemen.

11:20.930 --> 11:23.057
You know the rules here.
We don't waste food,

11:23.057 --> 11:25.101
and there is no fighting at Baratie.

11:25.101 --> 11:26.018
No.

11:26.686 --> 11:29.605
This ain't gonna be a fight.
I'm just going to kill him.

11:29.605 --> 11:30.606
Like to see you try.

11:30.606 --> 11:33.818
I'd like to pour you each a glass
of Ithürzburger Stein. On the house.

11:34.318 --> 11:36.237
Okay, I'll have that drink.

11:36.821 --> 11:40.032
- After he apologizes for his bad manners.
- Over my dead body.

[grunts]

11:50.376 --> 11:51.293
Good fighter.

11:55.631 --> 11:59.135
No cause for alarm, folks.
Please enjoy your meals.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.680
Hi, welcome to our shitty restaurant

12:02.680 --> 12:05.307
where the only thing
worse than the ambience is the food.

12:05.307 --> 12:07.268
My name is Sanji. What can I get for you?

12:07.268 --> 12:09.478
- One of everything, please.
- [Sanji] Any drinks?

12:09.478 --> 12:12.356
One of our signature cocktails
to help you choke down your meal?

12:12.356 --> 12:13.941
Giving us the hard sell, huh?

12:15.484 --> 12:18.738
Apologies, madam, I didn't see you there.
Would you care for an apéritif to start?

12:18.738 --> 12:20.948
We have several
rare Micqueot vintages in stock.

12:20.948 --> 12:22.950
Or perhaps you'd like a glass of Umeshu?

12:23.534 --> 12:26.245
You know, something sweet
for someone sweet.

12:26.829 --> 12:29.665
- Something wrong with your eye?
- Just blinded by your beauty.

12:29.665 --> 12:32.626
[clears throat] Waiter, can I get a beer
and something for my friends?

12:32.626 --> 12:35.671
- Two beers. I usually have three, but--
- And a milk.

12:35.671 --> 12:39.049
Three beers and a milk.
And, uh, for madam?

12:39.049 --> 12:40.092
Water.

12:40.092 --> 12:43.345
Still, sparkling, mineral?
With ice or without? Cubed or crushed?

12:43.345 --> 12:46.849
Regular water in a regular glass. Thanks.

12:46.849 --> 12:48.142
Right away.

12:48.809 --> 12:50.728
Ah!

12:53.272 --> 12:54.565
- What?
- Nothing.

12:56.442 --> 12:58.360
Madam. Forgive my rude behavior, madam.

12:58.360 --> 13:01.030
Would madam prefer her water
in a crystal glass,

13:01.030 --> 13:03.783
or would a golden bowl
be more madam's style?

13:03.783 --> 13:06.202
Nami's got a boyfriend.

13:06.202 --> 13:07.453
[all chuckling]

13:11.332 --> 13:12.541
You guys are the worst.

[Marines yelling indistinctly]

13:25.179 --> 13:26.388
Damage report?

13:26.388 --> 13:28.808
We're making progress, sir,
but the ship needs repairs.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.768
We've got to shore up the yard,
reinforce the--

13:30.768 --> 13:32.978
- How long till we sail?
- At least a day. Maybe two.

13:32.978 --> 13:36.065
Sir, the 77th Marine Branch
is running training exercises nearby.

13:36.065 --> 13:37.942
- They could be here in a few hours.
- No.

13:40.110 --> 13:41.654
We don't need their help.

13:41.654 --> 13:44.240
If we delay,
we might lose track of Luffy entirely.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.407
[Garp] No SOS calls.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.036
We'll handle this problem on our own.

13:50.120 --> 13:52.122
[suspenseful music plays]

14:01.006 --> 14:01.841
Hello.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.926
- [man screams over radio]
- [sword clangs]

14:04.635 --> 14:06.929
Mihawk, did I catch you
in the middle of something?

14:06.929 --> 14:08.722
[pasodoble music plays]

14:08.722 --> 14:09.807
[cannon firing]

14:12.518 --> 14:13.894
Just killing some time.

14:14.562 --> 14:15.479
[man screams]

14:16.230 --> 14:17.731
[men grunt]

14:19.567 --> 14:21.569
What can I do for you, Vice-Admiral?

14:21.569 --> 14:26.031
I've a request for you.
One that suits your particular talents.

14:26.031 --> 14:27.283
Who's the quarry?

14:27.908 --> 14:29.660
[yelling]

14:31.287 --> 14:33.622
A young upstart named Luffy.

14:34.206 --> 14:35.875
Fancies himself a pirate.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.418
[men scream]

14:37.418 --> 14:39.503
[pasodoble music continues]

14:40.546 --> 14:42.631
Doesn't sound like much of a challenge.

14:46.552 --> 14:48.929
[Garp] <i>Oh no, no, no.
Don't underestimate this one.</i>

14:48.929 --> 14:50.472
He's a wild card.

14:51.390 --> 14:52.433
One moment.

14:52.433 --> 14:54.184
[cannons firing]

14:58.439 --> 15:00.441
[men clamoring]

15:05.905 --> 15:07.239
[man] That's enough!

15:08.741 --> 15:10.743
[suspenseful music plays]

15:12.244 --> 15:14.204
I'm afraid it's time I ended this.

15:18.751 --> 15:19.668
[grunts]

15:21.837 --> 15:25.341
You've killed my men, destroyed my fleet.

15:26.842 --> 15:27.968
Why are you after me?

15:28.969 --> 15:30.846
You woke me from my nap.

15:30.846 --> 15:33.891
[grunts]
Then allow me to make it permanent!

15:42.316 --> 15:43.609
[men grunt]

15:44.109 --> 15:45.027
[grunts]

15:48.238 --> 15:51.742
Such a disappointing final gambit.

15:54.703 --> 15:56.246
[chuckles]

15:56.246 --> 15:57.957
[Krieg screams]

15:59.667 --> 16:01.126
[gurgling]

16:02.252 --> 16:03.879
[Mihawk] <i>Apologies, Vice-Admiral.</i>

16:04.630 --> 16:07.967
You've piqued my interest.
Where am I headed?

16:08.550 --> 16:11.136
East Blue. Sambas region.

16:12.346 --> 16:13.347
And, Mihawk,

16:13.973 --> 16:17.810
bring him alive by any means necessary.

16:21.563 --> 16:23.065
I can't eat another bite.

16:23.065 --> 16:24.984
But it's so good.

16:25.651 --> 16:28.362
- Oh man, you said it.
- I'm not gonna be hungry for a week.

16:28.362 --> 16:30.948
- Should we order dessert?
- I already got mine.

16:30.948 --> 16:31.865
Mmm.

16:31.865 --> 16:35.869
That reminds me. We should do a toast.
Come on. Grab your glasses.

16:37.454 --> 16:42.209
To the best crew sailing on the sea
and to our victory! Yeah!

16:42.209 --> 16:43.711
- [chuckles]
- [Nami] No, I'm sorry.

16:43.711 --> 16:45.337
What victory exactly?

16:45.921 --> 16:49.133
Against the Marines.
Our very first battle and we crushed them.

16:49.133 --> 16:51.969
I don't know how many naval battles
you guys have been part of--

16:51.969 --> 16:54.972
- Two dozen, at least.
- But that was a disaster.

16:54.972 --> 16:56.724
We were unprepared, uncoordinated.

16:56.724 --> 16:59.184
By all rights,
we should be at the bottom of the sea.

16:59.184 --> 17:01.228
We're not though. Luffy saved us.

17:03.605 --> 17:06.233
Are we really going to ignore
the elephant in the room right now?

17:07.568 --> 17:09.945
You didn't think to mention
your grandfather was a Marine?

17:09.945 --> 17:12.072
And not just any Marine, a vice-admiral!

17:12.072 --> 17:13.991
Don't know about you.
I didn't sign up for that.

17:13.991 --> 17:18.954
You raided a Marine base.
Of course that'll make you a target.

17:18.954 --> 17:21.123
If I stole the map,
no one would've known I was there,

17:21.123 --> 17:24.043
as opposed to wrecking
a base commander's office.

17:24.043 --> 17:25.252
[Sanji] Your bill, sir.

17:28.297 --> 17:29.131
Ah.

17:35.137 --> 17:36.430
Thank you, my good man.

17:38.724 --> 17:40.809
No, sir. Thank you.

17:43.437 --> 17:46.106
I'm not saying it's good
that the Marines are on our tail,

17:46.106 --> 17:50.611
but we showed them
that they can't just roll over us.

17:50.611 --> 17:54.782
This crew, our crew, can handle anything.

17:54.782 --> 17:57.534
Who the hell is Monkey D. Luffy?

17:59.453 --> 18:00.454
Here.

18:00.454 --> 18:02.956
You seem to be confused
about the rules of the house,

18:02.956 --> 18:05.084
but Baratie doesn't offer credit.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.878
You eat, you pay.

18:09.254 --> 18:10.547
I think you're confused.

18:10.547 --> 18:14.927
The meal has already been paid for.
I just haven't given you the money yet.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.011
Yeah, and how's that?

18:16.011 --> 18:18.180
You can add it to my treasure tab.

18:18.180 --> 18:20.516
And what, pray tell, is that?

18:20.516 --> 18:23.227
I may not look like a big deal yet,

18:23.227 --> 18:25.771
but you're talking
with the future King of the Pirates.

18:25.771 --> 18:28.232
And as soon as I find the One Piece,
I'm gonna come back,

18:28.232 --> 18:30.150
pay this bill in full,

18:30.150 --> 18:32.194
and with interest.

18:32.194 --> 18:33.487
[chuckles] I got a better idea.

18:34.404 --> 18:35.405
[Luffy grunts]

18:38.325 --> 18:39.451
I need a drink.

18:39.451 --> 18:41.078
Yeah. Now you're talking.

18:42.412 --> 18:45.415
You, Mr. Future-King-of-the-Pirates,
are gonna be my new chore boy.

18:45.916 --> 18:48.335
You're gonna pay off your debt
washing dishes.

18:48.335 --> 18:49.336
[Luffy grunts]

18:51.588 --> 18:53.382
- All of these?
- [owner] For starters.

18:53.382 --> 18:55.926
You gotta remember.
The meal you had with your friends?

18:55.926 --> 18:57.886
That's one year's worth of dishes.

18:58.387 --> 19:02.015
I'd get a move on if I was you.
Second service is in one hour.

19:03.475 --> 19:06.854
- Oy, oy. What do you think you're doing?
- Come on, old man. Enough's enough.

19:06.854 --> 19:10.065
Put the jacket back on, little eggplant.
You're not done with your shift yet.

19:10.065 --> 19:12.109
Let me back on the line or I walk.

19:12.109 --> 19:14.111
You can walk back into the ocean
for all I care.

19:14.111 --> 19:17.948
Cook another meal like that in my kitchen,
it's going right where the last one did.

19:17.948 --> 19:22.202
You can kick me out of the kitchen
all you like. I'll never be a waiter.

19:22.202 --> 19:26.373
That's fine by me. You sure as hell are
never gonna be a cook in my restaurant.

19:26.373 --> 19:27.416
Have you got it?

19:34.089 --> 19:36.091
[dance music plays]

19:48.061 --> 19:48.979
Pace yourself.

19:49.855 --> 19:52.733
I don't even think there's liquor in this.
It tastes just like candy.

19:52.733 --> 19:56.069
Last time I said that,
I woke up face down under a table.

19:58.071 --> 20:00.324
That glass have gold on the bottom
or what?

20:00.991 --> 20:03.535
- [Nami] Hmm?
- You haven't stopped staring at it.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.498
You seriously don't think
what Luffy did is messed up?

20:10.584 --> 20:13.295
Yeah. He should've told us.

20:14.087 --> 20:15.505
But in case you didn't notice,

20:15.505 --> 20:17.716
we've been making enemies
everywhere we go.

20:17.716 --> 20:22.262
Psycho clowns, killer butlers.
What's a vice-admiral gonna do to us?

20:22.262 --> 20:23.889
No, you don't get it.

20:24.598 --> 20:26.892
I can't get caught. Not when I'm so close...

20:31.271 --> 20:34.441
Uh, who's ready for another drink?
My treat.

20:34.942 --> 20:35.901
[Zoro] Mmm.

20:35.901 --> 20:37.319
My favorite kind of drink.

20:42.366 --> 20:44.159
Let me get your second-best bottle of rum.

20:44.159 --> 20:45.911
- [bartender] Anything else?
- Yeah.

20:45.911 --> 20:49.957
If I wanted to secure passage to
the Conomi Islands, who would I talk to?

20:49.957 --> 20:51.333
[man] Uh, that'd be me.

20:54.461 --> 20:55.712
It'll cost you.

20:55.712 --> 20:57.756
- Six thousand.
- I have Berry.

20:59.633 --> 21:01.176
[man] Need room for your friends too?

21:05.305 --> 21:06.974
No. Just me.

21:09.184 --> 21:10.269
I'm at slip 22.

21:10.936 --> 21:12.437
Be ready to sail at dawn.

21:26.660 --> 21:27.786
[sighs]

21:32.791 --> 21:35.877
I know I'm going to regret this,
but what's wrong?

21:36.545 --> 21:37.671
Nothing.

21:43.593 --> 21:45.053
What you said back at Syrup Village

21:46.763 --> 21:47.639
about Garp...

21:50.767 --> 21:54.146
- I'm starting to think you might be right.
- What is it, my birthday?

21:54.730 --> 21:55.939
Of course I'm right.

22:02.654 --> 22:04.448
You ever hear of anyone called Mihawk?

22:07.117 --> 22:08.618
Best swordsman in the world?

22:09.202 --> 22:11.663
Better with a blade
than anyone in living history?

22:13.373 --> 22:16.501
- One of the Seven Warlords of the Seas?
- Warlords?

22:18.128 --> 22:23.050
Years ago, there were
these seven incredibly powerful pirates,

22:23.717 --> 22:25.510
each one worse than the next.

22:25.510 --> 22:27.095
They ruled the seas,

22:28.013 --> 22:30.349
terrorizing everyone they came across.

22:30.891 --> 22:32.934
The World Government
could've gone after them,

22:32.934 --> 22:35.228
but that would've meant an all-out war.

22:35.729 --> 22:41.151
They realized it'd be more useful
to keep them close, as allies.

22:41.693 --> 22:44.154
So they struck a deal to work together.

22:45.739 --> 22:48.283
Why would the Marines
need to work with pirates?

22:48.283 --> 22:50.911
To do the things
they didn't want tied back to them.

22:50.911 --> 22:53.997
In exchange,
the Warlords were given free rein.

22:53.997 --> 22:55.082
To do pirate stuff?

22:56.958 --> 22:58.335
Illegal pirate stuff?

23:00.837 --> 23:03.715
Koby, you may know how to tie a knot,

23:04.925 --> 23:07.636
but you don't know shit
about how the world works.

23:24.194 --> 23:25.362
[Sanji] Hey, chore boy,

23:25.862 --> 23:27.531
how's that dish pile coming along?

23:28.198 --> 23:29.908
Never seems to get any smaller.

23:29.908 --> 23:31.910
The old man's a real piece of work.

23:32.786 --> 23:36.331
- Bet you regret giving him that IOU.
- I don't really do regret.

23:36.915 --> 23:39.126
- No point in looking back.
- [Sanji] Lucky you.

23:39.126 --> 23:42.295
Sometimes, when I try to look ahead,
all I see is back.

23:45.298 --> 23:47.884
- How long you been a waiter?
- [Sanji] Not a waiter. I'm a cook.

23:47.884 --> 23:49.511
Best one in the East Blue.

23:51.012 --> 23:52.013
Not that it matters.

23:52.013 --> 23:54.641
As long as the old man's in charge,
I'm banned from the line.

23:54.641 --> 23:58.270
- But that meal you cooked was incredible.
- The True Bluefin Sauté?

23:58.270 --> 23:59.771
- Yeah.
- [Sanji] You tried it?

23:59.771 --> 24:02.983
Yeah, of course I did.
I couldn't help myself.

24:03.567 --> 24:05.861
I didn't think the food here
could get any better.

24:07.154 --> 24:09.406
You know, you're a really good cook.

24:09.406 --> 24:11.700
- [Sanji] Eh.
- Why is Zeff making you wait tables?

24:11.700 --> 24:12.868
[Sanji] 'Cause he's jealous.

24:12.868 --> 24:14.161
I should be running this place,

24:14.161 --> 24:16.371
but the old man's so stubborn,
it'll never happen.

24:17.414 --> 24:18.707
So that's your dream.

24:19.624 --> 24:21.209
To be head chef of the Baratie.

24:21.793 --> 24:22.627
[Sanji] Nah.

24:24.838 --> 24:29.050
So you love to cook.
You just don't want to cook here?

24:35.807 --> 24:38.018
There's, um, this place

24:38.727 --> 24:42.564
where you can find ingredients
from all four seas.

24:43.273 --> 24:46.735
East Blue, West Blue, North, and South.
They call it the All Blue.

24:47.360 --> 24:49.154
Nobody knows where it is, but

24:50.614 --> 24:52.991
there's fish there
that have never been seen.

24:53.909 --> 24:58.205
You know, rare seaweeds.
Spices that have never been tasted.

24:59.372 --> 25:03.793
It is a cook's paradise,
and I'm gonna find it one day.

25:05.253 --> 25:06.296
That's my dream.

25:08.089 --> 25:10.133
If you want to cook, you should cook.

25:11.801 --> 25:17.641
Don't let some stubborn old man
get in the way of your dream.

25:19.976 --> 25:20.977
Stand up to him.

25:21.978 --> 25:23.146
Tell him what you want.

25:24.773 --> 25:27.651
It's more complicated than that.

25:29.194 --> 25:31.029
I don't really do complicated either.

25:32.322 --> 25:34.157
- [pounding on door]
- [man] Help me.

25:35.242 --> 25:37.827
- [man] Help!
- [suspenseful music plays]

25:38.954 --> 25:39.788
Please.

25:40.747 --> 25:41.831
[panting]

25:41.831 --> 25:42.749
Help me.

25:46.253 --> 25:47.212
[Sanji grunts]

25:49.256 --> 25:52.592
- Are you okay?
- I'm so hungry. Please.

25:52.592 --> 25:55.470
Okay, you got it, man. How does
some corned-beef fried rice sound?

25:55.470 --> 25:58.348
- What do you think you're doing?
- At Baratie, everyone eats.

25:58.348 --> 26:00.559
Who's gonna pay for that?
This is a business.

26:00.559 --> 26:03.812
We can't give handouts to every
down-on-his-luck pirate that washes up.

26:03.812 --> 26:06.022
If a man is hungry, I feed him.

26:07.607 --> 26:10.777
- Zeff kicked you off the line.
- I don't see the old man here. Do you?

26:12.028 --> 26:12.862
Your funeral.

26:12.862 --> 26:14.948
[upbeat music plays]

26:32.173 --> 26:34.009
I was drifting out there for a week.

26:35.594 --> 26:36.928
You saved my life tonight.

26:38.096 --> 26:40.807
You're not only a good cook.
You're a good guy.

26:41.349 --> 26:43.184
If Zeff doesn't appreciate you,

26:44.477 --> 26:45.437
you should join my crew.

26:47.063 --> 26:49.482
[Luffy] I'm serious. For real.

26:55.196 --> 26:57.365
Sorry, chore boy. I've already got a job.

26:57.365 --> 26:58.700
But you're not happy here.

26:59.200 --> 27:02.120
And we're gonna need a great cook
if we're gonna find the One Piece.

27:03.163 --> 27:04.080
The One Piece?

27:04.080 --> 27:07.709
Yeah, I'm gonna find it
and become King of the Pirates.

27:08.293 --> 27:09.544
We were searching for it too.

27:12.589 --> 27:14.799
I was part of a mighty pirate armada.

27:17.093 --> 27:20.347
Our captain was hell-bent
on finding Gold Roger's treasure, but

27:21.389 --> 27:23.016
the Grand Line was his undoing.

27:24.726 --> 27:27.687
We lost 50 ships and 5,000 men.

27:28.480 --> 27:29.939
I was the only survivor.

27:32.275 --> 27:33.151
Save yourself.

27:34.319 --> 27:37.155
Forget you ever heard of the One Piece.

27:40.492 --> 27:42.494
[dance music plays]

27:46.998 --> 27:49.376
He does have a certain grace about him.

27:49.376 --> 27:52.879
Like a frantic, uncoordinated--

27:52.879 --> 27:54.839
- Sea slug.
- [Nami] That's it.

27:55.507 --> 27:56.383
That's what he's like.

27:57.425 --> 28:00.220
Look at him.
Like he doesn't have a care in the world.

28:02.180 --> 28:04.349
What are you carrying around
that's so heavy?

28:05.183 --> 28:07.268
- You have no idea.
- I bet I do.

28:09.521 --> 28:12.565
I bet I know more about you
than you do about me.

28:12.565 --> 28:15.318
- Yeah, right. You're an open book.
- Care to prove it?

28:18.780 --> 28:21.074
I guess something about you, you drink.

28:22.492 --> 28:25.412
You guess something about me, I drink.

28:29.499 --> 28:30.417
Go ahead.

28:32.085 --> 28:33.920
Tell me all about myself.

28:33.920 --> 28:35.922
I bet you grew up in a big city,

28:36.965 --> 28:38.258
running schemes,

28:39.259 --> 28:41.845
hanging out in swanky bars like this one.

28:42.429 --> 28:44.723
- You must be thirsty.
- You're saying I'm wrong?

28:47.100 --> 28:51.229
I grew up in a small village.
Barely a village.

28:51.229 --> 28:55.150
Just a handful of houses
in the center of a tangerine grove.

28:57.986 --> 28:58.987
Drink.

29:05.368 --> 29:06.286
Ah.

29:08.329 --> 29:09.914
- Your turn.
- Okay.

29:10.457 --> 29:12.959
But I had you read
all the way back in Orange Town.

29:14.043 --> 29:16.171
I'll bet you didn't have any friends
as a kid.

29:16.171 --> 29:17.464
I had friends.

29:17.464 --> 29:18.715
Swords don't count.

29:24.554 --> 29:26.097
I had one friend.

29:30.935 --> 29:32.479
Hell, one more than I had.

29:36.608 --> 29:38.443
Drink.

29:44.032 --> 29:46.034
- [mysterious music plays]
- [Garp grunts]

29:50.955 --> 29:52.457
Should I come back later, sir?

29:54.042 --> 29:54.876
[Garp] No, no.

29:57.170 --> 29:58.922
I'm almost done here. [sniffs]

29:59.506 --> 30:00.590
What is it, cadet?

30:01.841 --> 30:04.302
Is it true
you're sending Dracule Mihawk after Luffy?

30:05.762 --> 30:07.013
That's a nasty habit,

30:08.389 --> 30:09.641
listening at doorways.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.267
I heard what I heard, sir.

30:12.977 --> 30:15.146
It seems there are different rules
for different pirates.

30:15.146 --> 30:16.564
And the ocean is blue.

30:17.440 --> 30:18.566
[silverware clatters]

30:20.276 --> 30:22.403
- Is there anything else?
- It's just...

30:24.948 --> 30:26.533
I signed an oath to protect people,

30:26.533 --> 30:29.244
to treat everyone equally under the law.

30:29.244 --> 30:30.745
And if that's not the case...

30:34.666 --> 30:36.251
maybe I'm not meant to be a Marine.

30:36.876 --> 30:37.710
Hmm.

30:39.170 --> 30:40.088
Have a seat, son.

30:45.885 --> 30:46.719
[Garp sniffles]

30:55.979 --> 30:58.606
I joined the Marines over 50 years ago.

30:59.941 --> 31:02.068
A green recruit like yourself.

31:02.694 --> 31:05.613
I came in with simple ideals,
but I had to adapt,

31:06.197 --> 31:08.241
because the world is not a simple place.

31:10.535 --> 31:12.412
The same set of laws
do not apply to everyone.

31:12.412 --> 31:13.746
But that's not fair.

31:13.746 --> 31:14.706
No, it's not.

31:16.624 --> 31:18.626
But you have to decide
if you can live with that.

31:20.795 --> 31:22.839
I could've been fleet admiral by now,

31:22.839 --> 31:25.508
but I always turned down the promotion.
Do you know why?

31:27.510 --> 31:29.888
Because I'd have to do things their way.

31:31.556 --> 31:32.807
I'd lose my freedom.

31:35.101 --> 31:36.019
Do you understand?

31:38.229 --> 31:39.355
Yes, sir.

31:39.355 --> 31:40.815
The world is not fair.

31:43.693 --> 31:48.156
But the Marines are all that are standing
between order and anarchy.

31:49.032 --> 31:51.326
So, let me ask you...

31:53.536 --> 31:54.913
can you live with that?

31:57.498 --> 31:58.583
I think so.

32:00.209 --> 32:01.044
Hmm.

32:06.215 --> 32:07.216
That uniform.

32:10.261 --> 32:11.846
It's starting to fit you after all.

32:16.643 --> 32:20.021
[slurring] And then they aimed
their biggest, baddest cannons at us.

32:22.774 --> 32:23.983
But I wasn't scared,

32:24.567 --> 32:27.070
being that I'm the best shot
in the East Blue.

32:27.570 --> 32:30.198
So I fired at 'em. [imitates explosion]

32:30.198 --> 32:32.075
And again. [imitates explosion]

32:32.075 --> 32:33.034
And again.

32:33.034 --> 32:35.870
Boom, boom, boom.

32:35.870 --> 32:38.873
Down goes their yard.
Marines dead in the water.

32:39.540 --> 32:42.543
All thanks to the great Captain Usopp.

32:42.543 --> 32:43.461
So,

32:44.754 --> 32:45.838
you're the captain?

32:47.173 --> 32:49.550
Well, technically, no.

32:50.093 --> 32:53.304
But I did distract them so that Luffy,

32:53.304 --> 32:55.598
who's, like, the official captain,

32:55.598 --> 32:58.685
could bounce that ball back. Boom.

32:59.227 --> 33:02.397
I should very much like
to meet this Luffy.

33:05.566 --> 33:06.526
Sure.

33:07.652 --> 33:10.029
Heck, come meet the whole crew.

33:11.990 --> 33:14.909
Guys, meet my new best friend.

33:15.618 --> 33:19.747
- What did you say your name was again?
- Which one of you is Monkey D. Luffy?

33:20.540 --> 33:21.791
[Nami] Who wants to know?

33:24.752 --> 33:26.087
You're Dracule Mihawk.

33:26.087 --> 33:28.172
[ominous music plays]

33:29.799 --> 33:31.634
I have business with your captain.

33:32.135 --> 33:34.303
If you know what's good for you,
you'll hand him over.

33:34.303 --> 33:37.515
[Nami] We don't know anyone named Luffy.
Right, Zoro?

33:38.433 --> 33:39.267
Zoro?

33:41.144 --> 33:44.605
I've been following your career
since I was a child.

33:44.605 --> 33:47.692
- It's an honor to finally meet you, sir.
- Thank you.

33:48.317 --> 33:50.486
Which is why it pains me

33:50.486 --> 33:52.280
to inform you that tomorrow...

33:55.408 --> 33:56.451
you're going to die.

33:56.451 --> 33:57.410
Wait, what?

33:58.828 --> 34:02.999
I, Roronoa Zoro, challenge you to a duel

34:04.375 --> 34:05.501
to the death.

34:12.258 --> 34:13.676
I've never heard of you.

34:13.676 --> 34:15.845
They call me the Demon Pirate Hunter.

34:17.055 --> 34:21.476
But my lifelong dream
is to best you in single combat

34:22.477 --> 34:25.063
and become
the greatest swordsman in the world.

34:26.272 --> 34:27.398
You're serious.

34:27.398 --> 34:28.900
Accept my challenge.

34:30.276 --> 34:31.819
You'll see how serious I am.

34:33.362 --> 34:34.280
Very well.

34:37.533 --> 34:38.743
Tomorrow at dawn.

34:39.577 --> 34:42.038
And when I'm done with you, pirate hunter,

34:43.289 --> 34:44.916
I'll take your captain.

34:52.465 --> 34:54.175
What the hell did you just do?

35:07.355 --> 35:08.731
Right, are we done yet?

35:12.693 --> 35:13.778
You're lousy at it.

35:13.778 --> 35:16.364
But at least you do as you're told
in this kitchen.

35:16.364 --> 35:19.325
If you think Sanji's gonna give up
on his dream because of you,

35:19.325 --> 35:20.618
then forget it.

35:21.661 --> 35:23.704
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

35:24.413 --> 35:27.792
You may have banned him from the line,
but you can't stop him from cooking.

35:27.792 --> 35:29.794
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, really.

35:30.294 --> 35:33.673
This starving pirate washed up earlier,
and you know what Sanji did?

35:33.673 --> 35:37.009
He cooked for him,
right here in your kitchen,

35:37.009 --> 35:41.514
because your rules matter less to him
than making sure a hungry man got fed.

35:43.558 --> 35:44.684
He did that, did he?

35:46.769 --> 35:47.728
What a good kid.

35:50.857 --> 35:52.483
Luffy, we've got a problem.

35:53.151 --> 35:55.736
[Nami] Maybe you can convince him
to call it off.

35:55.736 --> 35:59.323
- [Zoro] I won't do that.
- Did you see the size of that guy's sword?

35:59.323 --> 36:01.993
- He will slice you into sashimi.
- What's going on?

36:01.993 --> 36:03.286
I'll tell you what's going on.

36:03.286 --> 36:07.331
Your big, bad Marine grandpa
sent a Warlord of the Sea to bring you in,

36:07.331 --> 36:09.417
and instead of
getting the hell out of here,

36:09.417 --> 36:11.002
Zoro challenged him to a duel.

36:11.002 --> 36:11.919
Which he accepted.

36:11.919 --> 36:15.840
You are a fly to him.
Something to be swatted and forgotten.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.550
- Not if I win.
- [Nami] You're not going to.

36:17.550 --> 36:20.678
- You don't know that.
- Guys, guys, maybe we need more drinks.

36:22.847 --> 36:24.599
Tell your first mate
he'll get himself killed.

36:24.599 --> 36:26.392
Tell your navigator to butt out.

36:28.144 --> 36:30.021
Maybe this isn't such a great idea, Zoro.

36:32.023 --> 36:34.233
When you met me tied up on that cross,
what did I say?

36:34.233 --> 36:36.152
"What makes you think
I wanna play pirates?"

36:36.152 --> 36:38.487
- No, the other thing.
- "I kill your kind for a living"?

36:38.487 --> 36:39.989
No. Come... [groans]

36:40.656 --> 36:41.490
Oh.

36:44.619 --> 36:46.621
That you made a promise to someone
a long time ago

36:46.621 --> 36:48.289
to be the world's greatest swordsman.

36:48.289 --> 36:52.543
The only way to do that is to beat Mihawk
in a duel and take his title.

36:52.543 --> 36:54.754
I intend to do just that.

36:54.754 --> 36:56.714
Even if you die in the process?

36:59.091 --> 37:00.509
Will you please do something?

37:03.512 --> 37:04.639
It's his dream, Nami.

37:06.265 --> 37:08.392
I can't get in the way
of somebody's dream.

37:10.853 --> 37:11.938
What's it gonna take, huh?

37:12.521 --> 37:15.566
You want me to say you're the best?
You're the best. Okay?

37:16.067 --> 37:18.903
You're the best I've ever seen,
but you are not better than him.

37:18.903 --> 37:21.447
And if you fight him tomorrow,
you're going to lose.

37:21.447 --> 37:22.782
Why do you give a shit?

37:23.699 --> 37:25.701
Because you're my friend, you idiot.

37:27.536 --> 37:29.830
You said it yourself.
You don't have any friends.

37:50.935 --> 37:52.270
[throwing up]

38:30.683 --> 38:31.684
[man] Well,

38:33.269 --> 38:34.353
coming aboard?

38:36.856 --> 38:37.773
[man grunts]

39:00.004 --> 39:01.881
[Mihawk] Monkey D. Luffy.

39:03.007 --> 39:07.720
I'm surprised the Marines would require
my services for such a small package.

39:09.805 --> 39:11.974
- Though I do like your hat.
- [Zoro] Enough.

39:14.477 --> 39:15.603
Let's begin.

39:15.603 --> 39:17.188
[pasodoble music plays]

39:23.944 --> 39:25.988
What is that? I'm here for a sword fight.

39:25.988 --> 39:28.074
I don't hunt rabbits with a cannon.

39:32.995 --> 39:33.996
I'm no rabbit.

39:35.289 --> 39:36.999
That remains to be seen.

39:37.750 --> 39:39.752
[suspenseful action music plays]

40:04.652 --> 40:05.820
Got you on the run, huh?

40:07.947 --> 40:09.240
Hardly.

40:13.702 --> 40:15.037
[Mihawk] You're strong.

40:15.913 --> 40:17.832
But fighting isn't all about strength.

40:17.832 --> 40:19.375
Stop talking and fight.

40:20.543 --> 40:23.379
You're like a little frog
croaking in a well.

40:23.379 --> 40:25.381
Croak. Croak. Croak.

40:43.858 --> 40:45.818
[panting]

40:45.818 --> 40:49.155
One of us will become the world's
greatest swordsman to ever live.

40:55.369 --> 40:57.538
[heartbeat]

41:07.756 --> 41:09.258
Why don't you retreat?

41:13.512 --> 41:14.638
I can't...

41:17.141 --> 41:19.435
or my dream will be lost forever.

41:27.943 --> 41:30.321
You're brave. I'll give you that.

41:38.245 --> 41:41.165
So I'll do you the honor
of killing you with Yoru.

41:51.717 --> 41:52.927
That's more like it.

42:17.493 --> 42:18.661
Come on.

42:20.120 --> 42:21.997
[suspenseful music swells]

42:48.524 --> 42:49.441
[Zoro gasps]

42:50.693 --> 42:54.530
[Mihawk] You're defeated.
Why do you persist?

42:56.991 --> 43:01.954
Wounds on the back
are a swordsman's greatest shame.

43:10.963 --> 43:12.089
Magnificent.

43:34.987 --> 43:35.988
Zoro!

43:37.114 --> 43:39.116
[emotional music plays]

43:45.748 --> 43:49.126
[Mihawk] Monkey D. Luffy,
what's your goal?

43:50.085 --> 43:52.921
I'm going to become
the King of the Pirates.

43:53.589 --> 43:55.215
King of the Pirates, hey?

43:56.258 --> 43:59.678
That's a much more treacherous path
than even defeating me.

44:00.387 --> 44:01.555
I don't care.

44:03.641 --> 44:04.683
It's what I'm going to do.

44:05.309 --> 44:06.185
Hmm.

44:06.852 --> 44:08.270
Maybe you will at that.

44:10.064 --> 44:12.650
This world could use
a few more wild cards.

44:13.859 --> 44:15.194
Roronoa Zoro,

44:16.111 --> 44:17.821
it's too soon for you to die.

44:18.989 --> 44:20.824
Grow strong and come find me.

44:21.533 --> 44:22.534
I'll be waiting.

44:31.085 --> 44:32.628
He's losing so much blood.

44:34.588 --> 44:35.839
He's gonna be okay.

44:35.839 --> 44:38.008
Hey, Zoro, can you hear me?

44:39.551 --> 44:41.470
He said it's too soon for you to die.

44:42.096 --> 44:43.013
[Zoro] Luffy.

44:43.972 --> 44:48.060
If I fail to become
the world's greatest swordsman...

44:51.480 --> 44:52.856
you'll be disappointed.

44:53.482 --> 44:54.316
Right?

44:55.109 --> 44:56.360
You could never fail me.

45:00.489 --> 45:01.323
Never...

45:03.367 --> 45:04.201
again.

45:05.703 --> 45:06.578
From now...

45:08.622 --> 45:09.623
until I beat him.

45:12.960 --> 45:16.255
To become the greatest swordsman...

45:19.007 --> 45:20.884
I will never lose again!

45:28.684 --> 45:29.643
Zoro?

45:37.443 --> 45:38.277
Zoro?!

45:43.240 --> 45:44.366
Zoro!

45:46.535 --> 45:48.495
