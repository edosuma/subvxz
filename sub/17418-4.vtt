WEBVTT

00:10.854 --> 00:14.487
[Hastings] The target of
the 5th September ambush was
a protected witness.

00:14.521 --> 00:17.387
[Cottan] John Thomas Hunter.

00:17.421 --> 00:19.954
[Hastings] DI Denton,
I'm arresting you for conspiracy

00:19.987 --> 00:21.687
to murder a protected witness.

00:23.687 --> 00:26.587
[Cottan] DS Akers was the person
closest to the Witness,

00:26.621 --> 00:28.454
trusted by him.

00:28.487 --> 00:30.454
[Rich] You two always used to
end up side by side.

00:30.487 --> 00:32.621
I'd rather not investigate
the death of a former colleague.

00:32.654 --> 00:33.954
I like keeping a distance.

00:36.587 --> 00:38.654
On the night of the ambush,
he called me.

00:39.654 --> 00:41.887
Why'd you hide it?

00:41.921 --> 00:44.687
[Kate] Rich and I were involved,
behind Jayne's back.

00:44.721 --> 00:46.821
Looks like Jayne Akers
was on the receiving

00:46.854 --> 00:48.587
end of a substantial payment.

00:48.621 --> 00:50.687
- How substantial?
- Upwards of fifty grand.

00:55.087 --> 00:56.954
[Steve] Nurse? Where's the...

00:56.987 --> 00:58.554
[screams]

00:58.587 --> 01:00.421
[Kate] Who is that man?

01:02.887 --> 01:05.387
[Lindsay] The records show
that Superintendent Hastings

01:05.421 --> 01:08.721
is in considerable
financial difficulties.

01:08.754 --> 01:10.121
I'd like you to carry on.

01:10.154 --> 01:12.421
Very grateful, sir.
Thank you, sir.

01:12.454 --> 01:14.921
I think the fewer people
know about your situation,
the better.

01:17.087 --> 01:19.354
Don't you see
how I've been set up?

01:19.387 --> 01:22.087
And the only person I told about
the operation was Mike Dryden.

01:22.121 --> 01:23.954
On the night of the ambush,

01:23.987 --> 01:25.887
this particular officer
caused the rota to be changed.

01:25.921 --> 01:27.854
[reporter] Does the Deputy Chief
Constable have a statement

01:27.887 --> 01:29.954
to make regarding the allegation
about his speeding offence?

01:29.987 --> 01:32.421
My wife and I strenuously
deny the allegation.

01:35.121 --> 01:38.654
- Hargreaves calls you "Jolly".
- "Jolly" Rogerson.

01:38.687 --> 01:40.487
He's a laugh a minute.

01:40.521 --> 01:43.087
- So there's a body?
- We're taking it from here.

01:43.121 --> 01:45.454
[Lindsay] I was only searching
for Carly.

01:45.487 --> 01:48.154
Of all the long-term mispers,
why her?

01:48.187 --> 01:50.587
Call me later
for initial forensics.

01:53.087 --> 01:56.321
- [screaming]
- You've been talking to AC-12.

01:57.387 --> 01:58.954
I believe you.

02:06.121 --> 02:07.521
[morning radio show playing]

02:20.021 --> 02:21.887
- Morning.
- Morning.

02:38.654 --> 02:39.687
[blows]

02:50.154 --> 02:51.354
[kisses her]

03:10.654 --> 03:13.787
I've had to disclose
the situation at work.

03:13.821 --> 03:17.354
- Our situation?
- No, no. Just the money.

03:17.387 --> 03:18.987
Now the whole world
knows our business.

03:19.021 --> 03:21.454
No, no. Just one Executive
Officer, in confidence.

03:21.487 --> 03:23.121
A top man.

03:23.154 --> 03:26.721
In fact, this particular officer
thinks very highly of me

03:26.754 --> 03:29.621
so I can see things
getting a lot better.

03:30.421 --> 03:32.621
How so?

03:32.654 --> 03:35.621
If I was to put myself forward
for promotion.

03:35.654 --> 03:38.454
When this case is finished.

03:38.487 --> 03:41.654
This particular officer more
or less tipped me the wink.

03:43.721 --> 03:45.154
Right.

03:45.187 --> 03:48.387
A promotion's
no small thing, love.

03:48.421 --> 03:50.921
Pay rise. Bigger pension.

03:58.621 --> 04:01.154
We need to be clear
about a few things first.

04:01.187 --> 04:06.421
I'll say it again,
I am deeply sorry

04:06.454 --> 04:09.521
for having not consulted you
about the finances.

04:09.554 --> 04:12.021
It was a mistake.

04:12.054 --> 04:14.454
I just wanted to surprise you.

04:20.087 --> 04:21.121
[lets out laugh]

04:23.854 --> 04:25.554
Where's the harm in looking?

04:28.754 --> 04:30.121
Right, well, we've all read
this report.

04:30.154 --> 04:32.421
Looks like DS Akers
was on the take.

04:32.454 --> 04:34.687
Well, it's only
circumstantial so far.

04:34.721 --> 04:36.721
If the officer meant
to be looking after

04:36.754 --> 04:38.621
a protected witness
is getting paid off,

04:38.654 --> 04:40.454
and that witness gets killed,

04:40.487 --> 04:42.154
it doesn't leave much room
for circumstance

04:42.187 --> 04:43.921
as far as I'm concerned.

04:45.854 --> 04:47.687
Sorry, mate.

04:47.721 --> 04:51.621
- Evidence is evidence.
- Good. Dot, Steve,

04:51.654 --> 04:53.987
The husband, you said
he was acting suspiciously?

04:54.021 --> 04:56.687
I could've jumped
to the wrong conclusion.

04:56.721 --> 04:59.621
Its fine, Steve.
Let's just do our job.

04:59.654 --> 05:01.454
Well said, Kate.
Let's put it beyond doubt.

05:01.487 --> 05:03.354
Let's bring the husband in
for questioning

05:03.387 --> 05:05.587
and do a 32 search on his house.

05:05.621 --> 05:07.554
- Very good, sir.
- Off you go.

05:07.587 --> 05:10.154
Sir. We haven't discussed
Deputy Chief Constable Dryden.

05:10.187 --> 05:13.687
Denton's thrown suspicion
towards him and so far
it's all checked out.

05:13.721 --> 05:15.954
They worked together.
They had contact outside of work

05:15.987 --> 05:19.354
and he made sure she was on duty
the night of the ambush.

05:22.687 --> 05:25.787
That is one hell
of an accusation to throw
at a senior officer, Steve.

05:25.821 --> 05:30.621
Especially a Senior officer
with such an outstanding record
of public service.

05:30.654 --> 05:32.721
Well, there is this story
that was leaked to the press,

05:32.754 --> 05:35.621
about him and his wife
swapping points
on a driving offence.

05:35.654 --> 05:37.554
Now with respect, sir,

05:37.587 --> 05:39.854
if we didn't look into it
it'd look like favouritism.

05:39.887 --> 05:41.987
[Steve] And Sir,
I checked Dryden's web-site.

05:42.021 --> 05:44.521
He leaves tomorrow for a series
of speaking engagements.

05:44.554 --> 05:48.354
So If we don't bring him in
today, we lose him
for the rest of the week.

05:48.387 --> 05:50.654
We can delay bringing
in Rich Akers for 24 hours.

05:50.687 --> 05:52.954
He's going nowhere,
he's got no idea we're onto him.

05:52.987 --> 05:55.487
Dryden's potentially
more closely involved
with the ambush itself

05:55.521 --> 05:57.354
and that's
got to be our priority.

05:57.387 --> 05:59.054
And if only to rule him out
as soon as possible.

06:01.654 --> 06:04.454
Right, well, no mistakes mind:
I want all the I's dotted

06:04.487 --> 06:07.054
all the T's crossed
before that man sets one foot

06:07.087 --> 06:08.854
in this building,
you understand?

06:08.887 --> 06:11.354
- [all] Sir.
- On you go.

06:28.121 --> 06:30.621
Elvis has entered the building.

06:37.987 --> 06:39.854
Thank you for
your cooperation, sir.

06:39.887 --> 06:42.521
I hope this isn't going
to take long, Ted.

06:42.554 --> 06:44.487
Just waiting on
Chief Constable Lightwater, sir.

06:44.521 --> 06:46.587
Because of
the special arrangements.

06:46.621 --> 06:48.121
Barry Lightwater's coming up?

06:48.154 --> 06:49.921
His Force are having a bit
of a ding-dong

06:49.954 --> 06:51.854
with the PCC at the minute.
Between ourselves,

06:51.887 --> 06:53.821
I think he'll be glad
of the away-day.

06:57.587 --> 07:00.554
As I said, sir,
we're very grateful.

07:29.154 --> 07:31.854
- As you were.
- [Cottan] Thank you, sir.

07:35.087 --> 07:37.721
Sorry, sorry. Don't get up.

07:37.754 --> 07:39.554
- Sir, if you wouldn't mind...
- Thanks, Ted.

07:39.587 --> 07:42.021
Thank you. Thank you.

07:42.054 --> 07:44.054
I think the way this works
is you'll only hear from me

07:44.087 --> 07:45.787
if there's anything untoward.

07:45.821 --> 07:47.521
- [Hastings] Thank you, sir.
- Thanks, sir.

07:47.554 --> 07:48.854
[long, low beep]

07:57.187 --> 08:00.521
AC-12 interview of Deputy Chief
Constable Michael Dryden,

08:00.554 --> 08:05.421
with Superintendent Hastings,
DI Cottan, DS Arnott,
DC Fleming.

08:05.454 --> 08:07.887
Normal practice is
that the interviewee

08:07.921 --> 08:10.654
be questioned by an officer
at least one rank superior.

08:10.687 --> 08:13.487
However, in this case
that cannot happen,

08:13.521 --> 08:17.421
so Chief Constable Lightwater of
the East Midlands Constabulary

08:17.454 --> 08:19.787
has kindly agreed to sit in
as an observer.

08:19.821 --> 08:21.621
Is that alright
with you and the ACPO?

08:21.654 --> 08:23.387
I'm ready. Let's get on with it.

08:23.421 --> 08:24.954
Thank you, sir. Thank you.
Well, I refer you

08:24.987 --> 08:26.721
to Document 1 in your folders.

08:26.754 --> 08:28.354
[turning pages]

08:28.387 --> 08:29.887
[Hastings] A complaint
has been made

08:29.921 --> 08:31.621
regarding a traffic offence,

08:31.654 --> 08:33.554
an SP-30,

08:33.587 --> 08:36.987
which occurred on the night
of August 16th this year.

08:37.021 --> 08:40.454
Vehicle registered to Mrs. Helen
Dryden, was photographed

08:40.487 --> 08:44.487
by a speed camera travelling
in excess of the speed limit.

08:44.521 --> 08:47.754
Then, a week later,
on August 23rd,

08:47.787 --> 08:50.487
the Traffic Division received
notice from Mrs. Helen Dryden

08:50.521 --> 08:52.121
that at the time
the incident occurred

08:52.154 --> 08:54.154
the vehicle was actually
being driven by yourself,

08:54.187 --> 08:57.121
- Deputy Chief Constable Dryden.
- Correct.

08:57.154 --> 09:00.021
An allegation has been
made that Mrs. Dryden

09:00.054 --> 09:02.554
and/or yourself
falsified that notification.

09:02.587 --> 09:06.054
Untrue. I was driving.
Helen was home.

09:06.087 --> 09:09.621
[Hastings] And, um, remember
the reason for your journey
that evening?

09:09.654 --> 09:13.487
I left home and drove back
towards town to buy some beer
and wine from the off-licence.

09:13.521 --> 09:15.954
Changed my mind,
went back home.

09:15.987 --> 09:18.821
And can you account for
the allegation to the contrary?

09:18.854 --> 09:22.087
I'm a target.
Someone in the Organization
wants to make me look bad.

09:22.121 --> 09:23.887
I hope you'll spend as much time
looking for them

09:23.921 --> 09:26.654
as you do investigating
this codswallop.

09:26.687 --> 09:29.754
- We will, sir. We will.
- Glad to hear it.

09:31.454 --> 09:34.121
Would I be able
to ask a question, sir?

09:34.154 --> 09:36.554
Full marks for balls. Go on.

09:36.587 --> 09:37.921
You didn't go
into the off-licence?

09:37.954 --> 09:39.587
No.

09:39.621 --> 09:40.987
So the only person likely
to have seen you

09:41.021 --> 09:42.121
leave and return home is
Mrs. Dryden?

09:42.154 --> 09:44.121
[Dryden] Most probably.

09:44.154 --> 09:46.154
[Steve] Will we be able to take
a statement from Mrs. Dryden?

09:46.187 --> 09:48.354
Don't they train you
people anymore?

09:48.387 --> 09:50.054
A spouse isn't
a compellable witness.

09:50.087 --> 09:51.987
Sir, we're under no obligation
to inform your wife

09:52.021 --> 09:53.921
that she's not
a compellable witness;

09:53.954 --> 09:55.587
and whether she can or can't
give evidence against you

09:55.621 --> 09:57.887
is a moot point
as per R v L 2008.

09:57.921 --> 10:00.087
I'll inform her.
She'll back me up.

10:00.121 --> 10:02.921
Nothing moot there.
Anything else?

10:02.954 --> 10:04.921
[Steve] Why did you change
your mind about going into
the off licence?

10:04.954 --> 10:06.621
Just did.

10:08.054 --> 10:09.787
Um,

10:09.821 --> 10:11.787
If I may, sir,
there's just a few loose ends

10:11.821 --> 10:13.987
I'd like to clear up regarding
our investigation

10:14.021 --> 10:17.421
into the ambush of the night
of September 5th.

10:17.454 --> 10:19.721
My number one priority.
Anything to help.

10:19.754 --> 10:21.421
Thank you, sir.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.087
[Kate] DC Fleming, sir.

10:23.121 --> 10:26.087
You took a call that evening
from DI Lindsay Denton?

10:26.121 --> 10:28.621
Yes. She couldn't get hold of
her Duty Chief Superintendent.

10:28.654 --> 10:31.787
She called me. I gave Gold
approval for the operation.

10:31.821 --> 10:34.554
Did she disclose to you
the nature of the operation,
sir?

10:34.587 --> 10:36.354
No, I regularly
sign off on operations

10:36.387 --> 10:38.621
without knowing the first
bloody thing about them.

10:40.154 --> 10:41.987
- Sorry, sir.
- [Steve] Specifically, sir,

10:42.021 --> 10:43.821
did you give approval
to DI Denton

10:43.854 --> 10:46.821
to proceed without back-up
and without firearms?

10:46.854 --> 10:48.787
Wasn't the call recorded?

10:48.821 --> 10:50.987
She made the call
from her office phone

10:51.021 --> 10:52.987
and not the Duty Desk,
so no, sir.

10:55.087 --> 10:58.887
I don't recall DI Denton
apprising me of those facts.

10:58.921 --> 11:02.787
If she had, I would've
expressed misgivings, of course.

11:02.821 --> 11:04.954
[Kate] In terms
of the on-call rotas,

11:04.987 --> 11:08.054
specifically the ghost rota
for 4th Street Station,

11:08.087 --> 11:10.454
is that something you'd ever
normally take an interest in?

11:10.487 --> 11:12.154
Why would I?

11:12.187 --> 11:14.154
So you weren't involved at all
in the circumstances

11:14.187 --> 11:17.987
that led to DI Denton being
the Duty Inspector that evening?

11:18.021 --> 11:20.687
I also personally supervise
whether beat bobbies

11:20.721 --> 11:22.554
put on their left shoe first
or their right.

11:24.621 --> 11:26.421
Anything else?

11:26.454 --> 11:28.121
Sir, could anyone have overheard
the conversation you had

11:28.154 --> 11:30.121
- with DI Denton?
- Only my wife.

11:30.154 --> 11:32.554
Somehow it feels like
we've been here before, DS...

11:32.587 --> 11:35.921
Arnott, sir. Did she overhear
or did you discuss
the call with her?

11:35.954 --> 11:37.654
Where are we going with this?

11:37.687 --> 11:40.387
Sir, I think DS Arnott's worried
that your wife

11:40.421 --> 11:42.754
may have got her Sewing Circle
to carry out the ambush.

11:42.787 --> 11:45.087
[Dryden laughs]

11:45.121 --> 11:47.687
I think we can safely discount
that theory, DI...

11:47.721 --> 11:49.654
- Cottan, sir.
- Cottan.

11:49.687 --> 11:53.087
That's right. The Witness
Protection expert from AC-9.

11:53.121 --> 11:55.454
That's right, Sir.

11:55.487 --> 11:57.921
Look Ted, you're married.
You know what it's like.

11:57.954 --> 12:00.087
You take a call from a woman
after ten o'clock at night,

12:00.121 --> 12:03.021
God help you if you don't say
what it was about. Am I right?

12:03.054 --> 12:04.721
Yes, that's right, sir.

12:04.754 --> 12:07.621
Well, I'm divorced, sir.
Now I know why.

12:07.654 --> 12:09.487
[both laugh]
[Dryden] Exactly.

12:09.521 --> 12:12.554
I told my wife it was
a work call, nothing more.

12:12.587 --> 12:14.154
Obviously, if you need
to take this further,

12:14.187 --> 12:16.454
I'm completely at your disposal.

12:16.487 --> 12:18.754
Whatever it takes to
get those bastards. Right, Ted?

12:18.787 --> 12:21.787
- Thank you, sir.
- [Kate] Sir,

12:21.821 --> 12:23.587
the call from DI Denton?

12:23.621 --> 12:25.821
Was that your first contact
with her?

12:25.854 --> 12:27.721
What d'you mean?

12:27.754 --> 12:30.321
[Kate] Did you know her at all,
sir?

12:33.854 --> 12:36.487
Look, Kate, I think we're
really obliged to operate

12:36.521 --> 12:38.754
within the parameters
of the Reg 15 notice
that we served.

12:38.787 --> 12:41.621
And any other lines of enquiry
really have to be submitted

12:41.654 --> 12:46.387
in writing to Deputy Chief
Constable Dryden and the ACPO.

12:46.421 --> 12:48.621
- Fine.
- Correct, Sir?

12:48.654 --> 12:51.487
- Quite right, Hastings.
- [Hastings] Thank you sir.

12:51.521 --> 12:53.821
Once again, apologies
for troubling you, sir.

12:53.854 --> 12:55.354
Sure.

12:57.654 --> 13:00.587
- Sir?
- Ted?

13:00.621 --> 13:02.154
My team, you know, sir,

13:02.187 --> 13:04.021
- they're young they're keen.
- It's fine.

13:04.054 --> 13:06.054
You know I hope you realise
why this was necessary.

13:06.087 --> 13:08.721
- Nobody can appear above--
- Ted, it's fine.

13:08.754 --> 13:10.687
It's just that I would be
mortified if you thought

13:10.721 --> 13:13.587
that I wasn't grateful
for your support, sir.

13:13.621 --> 13:16.654
Never crossed my mind.
Keep up the good work.

13:46.164 --> 13:47.864
Sir? I've listed the questions

13:47.897 --> 13:49.897
that remain unanswered
in regard to Dryden:

13:49.930 --> 13:51.797
whether he approved the lack
of back-up, firearms,

13:51.830 --> 13:53.397
changing the rota
to put Denton on duty;

13:53.430 --> 13:54.797
his alleged relationship
with her--

13:54.830 --> 13:56.297
Look, the gaffer's already said

13:56.330 --> 13:58.030
we've got to be careful
about what we say.

13:58.064 --> 13:59.897
What, that explains
your stand-up routine?

13:59.930 --> 14:02.230
Yeah well there's more
than one way to skin a cat.

14:02.264 --> 14:04.430
I don't remember
saying, "Come in."

14:04.464 --> 14:05.330
Sir.

14:08.130 --> 14:10.797
It's alright, Steve,
you did a grand job.

14:10.830 --> 14:12.430
I need clarification, sir.

14:12.464 --> 14:14.364
Will we be seeking an interview
with Mrs. Dryden?

14:14.397 --> 14:17.297
No, no. It's bound to be
non-evidential.

14:17.330 --> 14:19.297
- Yes, sir.
- [Cottan] Sounds like a load

14:19.330 --> 14:21.197
of old bollocks to me anyway.

14:21.230 --> 14:23.164
Why would he lie
to incriminate himself?

14:23.197 --> 14:26.164
If anything he'd dodge it
and then put it on his missus.

14:26.197 --> 14:27.964
Well I think we're getting
a deeper insight into

14:27.997 --> 14:29.997
why Dot's divorced.

14:30.030 --> 14:33.497
Why don't we just close
the whole thing shall we?

14:33.530 --> 14:35.330
- Dump it back on Traffic.
- Yes, sir.

14:35.364 --> 14:37.130
And the alleged relationship
with Denton?

14:37.164 --> 14:39.264
I mean, are we seeking evidence?

14:39.297 --> 14:41.164
I thought she said
it was over, Steve?

14:41.197 --> 14:42.997
With respect, sir,
though it's historical,

14:43.030 --> 14:45.297
it connects Denton to the person
she alleges set her up.

14:45.330 --> 14:48.064
Can we just not be saying
career-ending stuff
like that out loud?

14:48.097 --> 14:50.197
[Hastings] Yeah, yeah.
Okay, okay.

14:51.997 --> 14:56.930
Alright, Steve, seek
corroboration. But remember.

14:56.964 --> 14:59.997
We're dealing
with somebody's marriage here.

15:00.030 --> 15:03.230
- Sir.
- Sir.
- Sir.

15:12.864 --> 15:15.564
[inmate] What's she doing
next door? Oi!

15:15.597 --> 15:17.597
[Regan] (BANGING) MOVE AWAY
FROM THE DOOR!

15:17.630 --> 15:18.830
[door buzzes]

15:22.497 --> 15:24.864
What happened to the other two?

15:32.464 --> 15:33.497
[keys tinkling]

15:35.397 --> 15:38.364
For your own safety,
you'll exercise alone.

15:40.830 --> 15:41.864
[bell rings]

15:51.464 --> 15:52.497
[bell rings]

16:14.997 --> 16:17.064
What if Dryden
was trying to create an alibi

16:17.097 --> 16:19.764
for the night
of the driving offence?

16:21.497 --> 16:24.030
Okay.

16:24.064 --> 16:27.264
Request his electronic diary
and access to his work emails.

16:27.297 --> 16:29.197
Find out what his official
movements were that day.

16:29.230 --> 16:30.797
Okay.

16:32.230 --> 16:33.397
[phone rings]

16:33.430 --> 16:35.264
[Kate] DC Fleming.

16:37.164 --> 16:40.364
- Thank you.
- What?

16:40.397 --> 16:43.497
Major Violent Crime
have arrested Rich Akers.

16:45.297 --> 16:47.464
<i>[Hargreaves] Your late wife,</i>
<i>DS Jayne Akers:</i>

16:47.497 --> 16:49.597
why was there a dramatic change

16:49.630 --> 16:51.330
<i>in her financial situation</i>

16:51.364 --> 16:54.164
<i>in the month leading up</i>
<i>to her death?</i>

16:54.197 --> 16:55.564
I don't know
what you're referring to.

16:57.497 --> 17:02.430
Here's a breakdown obtained
by our Financial Forensics Unit.

17:02.464 --> 17:05.297
It shows her financial activity
<i>over the last six months.</i>

17:05.330 --> 17:08.297
<i>[Hargreaves] For the first</i>
<i>five months, there's</i>
<i>a consistent pattern</i>

17:08.330 --> 17:10.264
<i>of debits to the account,</i>

17:10.297 --> 17:12.830
cash-card withdrawals,
goods and services

17:12.864 --> 17:15.430
using the associated
debit cards.

17:15.464 --> 17:18.197
Then, suddenly, it stops dead.

17:18.230 --> 17:21.897
[Rogerson] No cash-point
withdrawals. No debit card
payments.

17:21.930 --> 17:25.197
[Rogerson] It's as if your wife
<i>miraculously stopped</i>
<i>spending any money.</i>

17:25.230 --> 17:29.197
<i>- Or needing any.</i>
<i>- Uh... Okay.</i>

17:29.230 --> 17:31.564
We see this sort of pattern
when a person resorts

17:31.597 --> 17:34.064
to paying their way in cash.

17:35.197 --> 17:36.530
Okay.

17:38.330 --> 17:41.197
Do you recognise
this bank statement,

17:41.230 --> 17:43.297
also obtained by our F.F.U.?

17:45.864 --> 17:47.397
My bank account.

17:47.430 --> 17:49.197
You haven't made
a single cashpoint withdrawal

17:49.230 --> 17:51.097
in over six weeks.

17:51.130 --> 17:54.130
There's barely an item paid
for by card.

17:54.164 --> 17:55.564
Don't you need the money either?

17:57.197 --> 17:58.897
Well, I wasn't earning.

17:58.930 --> 18:01.330
So that I knew I had
to tighten my belt.

18:03.230 --> 18:04.430
<i>[Rogerson] A team conducted</i>
<i>a search</i>

18:04.464 --> 18:07.397
<i>of your property today.</i>

18:07.430 --> 18:09.930
<i>Your client was under arrest,</i>
<i>hence the search was authorised</i>

18:09.964 --> 18:12.264
<i>under Section 18 brackets 1</i>
<i>of the Police</i>

18:12.297 --> 18:14.430
<i>and Criminal Evidence Act.</i>

18:16.464 --> 18:21.230
[Hargreaves] This case was found
hidden under the floorboards.

18:21.264 --> 18:24.097
It contained
twenty thousand pounds in cash.

18:26.097 --> 18:29.497
24 hours. He's going nowhere.

18:29.530 --> 18:30.797
Twat.

18:31.864 --> 18:33.797
[footsteps fade away]

18:33.830 --> 18:35.864
It's not your fault, mate.

18:35.897 --> 18:37.897
They got hold
of the financial forensics,
that's all.

18:37.930 --> 18:40.030
Yeah.

18:40.064 --> 18:43.864
<i>[Hargreaves] So...</i>
<i>Where did it come from?</i>

18:43.897 --> 18:45.564
<i>I've never seen it before.</i>

18:47.197 --> 18:48.564
Never saw your wife with it?

18:48.597 --> 18:50.830
I said
I've never seen it before.

18:50.864 --> 18:52.597
<i>[Hargreaves] Your wife she was</i>
<i>taking bribes,</i>

18:52.630 --> 18:54.264
<i>- wasn't she?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

18:54.297 --> 18:56.230
I thought you said
you didn't ask!

18:56.264 --> 18:58.330
Must've been pretty obvious
something was going on.

18:58.364 --> 19:00.130
You didn't think to ask where
all this cash was coming from?

19:00.164 --> 19:01.830
- No.
- Why not?

19:01.864 --> 19:03.530
I just didn't.

19:07.530 --> 19:11.230
<i>[Hargreaves] Richard Akers,</i>
<i>the evidence obtained</i>
<i>in our investigation</i>

19:11.264 --> 19:13.964
<i>is being forwarded to</i>
<i>the Crown Prosecution Service.</i>

19:13.997 --> 19:18.064
For authority to charge you
under Section 329 brackets 1

19:18.097 --> 19:19.997
of the Proceeds of Crime Act,

19:20.030 --> 19:22.030
in that you acquired, used

19:22.064 --> 19:24.464
or had possession
of criminal property,

19:24.497 --> 19:26.964
namely funds received
by your wife as part

19:26.997 --> 19:30.064
of a conspiracy to murder
a protected witness.

19:33.330 --> 19:36.030
Interview terminated.

19:36.064 --> 19:37.197
[stops and ejects the tape]

19:46.064 --> 19:47.097
[door closes]

19:53.264 --> 19:57.530
Fact is you had
the same evidence we had.

19:57.564 --> 19:59.330
Only we acted, didn't we.

19:59.364 --> 20:00.497
You didn't.

20:07.430 --> 20:09.030
Kate.

20:10.897 --> 20:13.164
It's bad enough already.
Behave yourself.

20:13.197 --> 20:14.330
Yeah.

20:19.164 --> 20:21.330
DS Arnott, AC-12.

20:21.364 --> 20:23.464
We've been given authorisation
by the Custody Officer

20:23.497 --> 20:26.164
to conduct an intelligence
interview, off tape.

20:27.897 --> 20:31.097
- It's fine.
- Okay.

20:40.097 --> 20:41.530
Bastard.

20:41.564 --> 20:43.797
Holier than thou
doesn't suit you, Kate.

20:44.997 --> 20:46.897
You never turned a blind eye?

20:46.930 --> 20:48.330
Benefited from one?

20:49.997 --> 20:52.064
This lot, they're going to
crucify Jayne,

20:52.097 --> 20:53.530
whether they
get the facts or not.

20:59.030 --> 21:01.964
- Who's out there?
- No one.

21:07.597 --> 21:11.030
She kept records. Hidden.

21:11.930 --> 21:14.830
Records of what?

21:14.864 --> 21:19.164
Her last case. The protected
witness who got killed.

21:19.197 --> 21:21.464
I believe she wanted leverage
against the criminal parties

21:21.497 --> 21:24.264
she was dealing with.

21:24.297 --> 21:26.930
These records.
Where are they now?

21:32.130 --> 21:34.364
On flash-drives.

21:37.397 --> 21:40.564
I put them all in a Jiffy bag.

21:40.597 --> 21:43.397
I set up a P.O. box -
sent them all to it.

21:46.064 --> 21:47.097
[sighs]

21:55.964 --> 21:57.530
[door opens and closes]

22:04.997 --> 22:06.897
Thank you.

22:33.497 --> 22:34.530
[footsteps]

22:45.464 --> 22:48.330
[Kate] Look, I'm sorry.
I have to work late again.

22:48.364 --> 22:50.930
[partner] You must think
I'm some sort of idiot.

22:54.430 --> 22:56.097
[banging on the door]

22:56.130 --> 22:57.930
[prison officer] Step away
from the door.

22:57.964 --> 22:58.997
[door buzzes and opens]

23:05.264 --> 23:06.897
[knocks on the door]

23:06.930 --> 23:08.464
[Fiona] Come in.

23:11.497 --> 23:15.330
Hello Lindsay, I'm Fiona.
Please sit down.

23:19.464 --> 23:20.497
[door closes]

23:22.630 --> 23:25.497
I have some bad news for you.

23:25.530 --> 23:29.297
This morning I took a call
from the Ashcliffe Nursing Home.

23:29.330 --> 23:33.297
In the early hours, your mother
suffered a very severe stroke.

23:33.330 --> 23:37.264
She's very poorly.
I'm very sorry.

23:38.430 --> 23:39.530
Uh... [clears throat]

23:39.564 --> 23:41.297
How's she doing now?

23:42.464 --> 23:44.364
They're keeping her comfortable.

23:46.430 --> 23:49.397
There's a geriatrician,
Dr. Panesar.

23:49.430 --> 23:51.064
Yes he's seen her.

23:51.097 --> 23:52.864
They've decided
not to transfer her,

23:52.897 --> 23:55.064
as she's D.N.R.
Not for Resuscitation--

23:55.097 --> 23:57.097
I signed the order.

24:01.097 --> 24:03.364
Please accept our sympathies
at this very difficult time.

24:06.330 --> 24:09.564
I am available to you as
your Personal Wellbeing Officer.

24:11.164 --> 24:12.864
I can also arrange
an appointment

24:12.897 --> 24:14.797
with our Chaplaincy Service.

24:14.830 --> 24:16.764
Wouldn't I see a homeopath
while I'm at it?

24:17.997 --> 24:19.597
Are you being very sarcastic

24:19.630 --> 24:21.297
or would you like me
to contact a homeopath?

24:23.064 --> 24:24.964
I just want to see my mum.

24:29.164 --> 24:30.197
[typing]

24:35.464 --> 24:38.330
You were involved
in a disturbance.

24:38.364 --> 24:39.897
And you've self-harmed.

24:39.930 --> 24:42.097
I was attacked.

24:42.130 --> 24:44.564
I can only go on what
they've recorded in your file.

24:44.597 --> 24:47.364
And that means
that I can't see my mum?

24:47.397 --> 24:48.930
It's up to the Governor.

25:06.301 --> 25:09.334
Kate. Jayne Akers flash drives.

25:10.568 --> 25:12.401
Go for it.

25:15.401 --> 25:17.301
[Kate] Right. We've prioritised
the stuff dated

25:17.334 --> 25:19.301
in the run-up to the ambush.

25:19.334 --> 25:23.368
"T. incensed by August 9th
statement." T. - Tommy.

25:23.401 --> 25:25.701
Right, let's see who was saying
what on August 9th,

25:25.734 --> 25:27.668
- yeah?
- Okay.

25:27.701 --> 25:30.701
"Need to reassure him about
his immunity from prosecution."

25:30.734 --> 25:34.101
"If SH compromised,
require quick Tx."

25:34.134 --> 25:36.068
- Safe House.
- [Cottan] Transfer.

25:36.101 --> 25:38.634
- [Kate] "Contact made."
- Contact with who?

25:38.668 --> 25:41.168
- Denton, maybe?
- [Steve] Can't be.

25:41.201 --> 25:43.234
This was from before the night
of the ambush,

25:43.268 --> 25:44.534
before Akers called her.

25:44.568 --> 25:45.701
No further entries to say

25:45.734 --> 25:47.201
who she made contact with.

25:47.234 --> 25:48.268
Steve.

25:59.268 --> 26:01.168
24 hours, son,
that's what you said.

26:03.234 --> 26:07.001
I messed up, boss. No excuses.

26:07.034 --> 26:11.334
Steve, You and I
have had our differences.

26:11.368 --> 26:13.701
But they're a damn sight easier
to overlook

26:13.734 --> 26:15.968
if the job's being done.

26:37.401 --> 26:38.434
[buzzer sounds]

26:52.934 --> 26:53.968
[unlocks door]

27:03.234 --> 27:06.268
It was Hargreaves' decision
to make the arrest.

27:06.301 --> 27:08.001
I argued the toss,
for what it's worth.

27:12.934 --> 27:15.234
- Okay.
- Wait.

27:19.601 --> 27:21.434
You want a beer?

27:23.601 --> 27:25.034
Yeah.

27:38.934 --> 27:40.468
You've got every right
to be pissed off.

27:40.501 --> 27:43.268
No shit?

27:43.301 --> 27:45.668
When you said you thought
Richard Akers was hiding
something.

27:45.701 --> 27:48.134
I didn't say run
financial forensics on him!

27:48.168 --> 27:49.534
It's my job.

27:49.568 --> 27:50.701
What, to drop me
in it with my boss?

27:50.734 --> 27:52.134
I got you access

27:52.168 --> 27:53.901
to the hospital car park CCTV,

27:53.934 --> 27:56.301
to the crime scene
on the industrial estate.

27:56.334 --> 27:59.001
I just took it to be a bit of
you know you-scratch-my-back.

27:59.034 --> 28:00.168
That came later.

28:01.968 --> 28:05.034
Yeah. Well I'm glad
I didn't have to point that out.

28:08.968 --> 28:11.601
Anyway. That's all
I came to say, so.

28:11.634 --> 28:13.634
You don't have to go.

28:17.601 --> 28:18.634
[sighs]

28:21.534 --> 28:25.234
You and me, we just... we just
want to get the job done.

28:27.634 --> 28:29.668
It's pretty hard
to set that aside.

28:30.468 --> 28:31.601
Yeah.

28:33.634 --> 28:36.534
I'm not saying this is over.

28:36.568 --> 28:37.968
"On hold."

28:38.634 --> 28:40.001
Yeah.

28:48.068 --> 28:50.901
My non-work number.
For when this is all over.

28:52.734 --> 28:54.034
Good luck getting the job
done.

28:54.634 --> 28:55.868
You too.

28:58.534 --> 28:59.568
[door closes]

29:16.968 --> 29:19.568
[Steve] DS Arnott, AC-12.

29:23.001 --> 29:24.634
Just a moment please.

29:24.668 --> 29:27.434
It's alright.
I've sorted the paperwork.

29:27.468 --> 29:29.601
How'd you find out
about this place?

29:29.634 --> 29:32.334
- Been working flat out.
- This way.

29:36.034 --> 29:38.301
These are the vehicles
from the crime scene.

29:38.334 --> 29:41.134
They were analysed in situ
till 6th September

29:41.168 --> 29:43.234
then sent to us for storage.

29:45.568 --> 29:47.701
[Steve] This is the vehicle
registered to DS Akers?

29:47.734 --> 29:49.634
[storage manager] The very one.

29:49.668 --> 29:51.634
[Steve] Everything's as was?

29:51.668 --> 29:53.268
[storage manager] With
the exception of items recovered

29:53.301 --> 29:55.268
from on or inside the vehicle.

29:55.301 --> 29:57.101
Where are they?

30:01.534 --> 30:05.434
Here. I've got an inventory
of the items held in evidence.

30:05.468 --> 30:07.668
- We'll need to see it.
- I'll print you out a copy.

30:07.701 --> 30:09.668
And we'll need to inspect
the evidence ourselves.

30:13.268 --> 30:15.201
Thanks.

30:36.101 --> 30:38.568
You ever seen
one of these before?

30:40.368 --> 30:42.501
We used them
when I worked in Counter-Terror.

30:42.534 --> 30:46.101
- What is it?
- A tracking device.

30:46.134 --> 30:48.234
[Hargreaves] What the hell
are you up to?

30:48.268 --> 30:49.701
[Steve] How long you been
sitting on this?

30:49.734 --> 30:51.501
- Get out.
- It's a private facility.

30:51.534 --> 30:53.201
You've got no jurisdiction here.

30:53.234 --> 30:55.301
- Him, out.
- I've already presented you

30:55.334 --> 30:57.068
with a warrant to search
these premises.

30:57.101 --> 30:58.934
Any obstruction
of me and my colleague

30:58.968 --> 31:00.434
and you'll be arrested
for obstructing a police officer

31:00.468 --> 31:02.901
in the lawful execution
of their duty.

31:02.934 --> 31:04.968
Do you mind
giving us a minute, please?

31:09.468 --> 31:11.234
There was a lump on that car.

31:11.268 --> 31:12.968
Oh and all of a sudden,
you've become a detective.

31:13.001 --> 31:15.068
When d'you find it? Day one?

31:15.101 --> 31:17.034
You want to
wind your neck in, son.

31:17.068 --> 31:19.268
We were investigating Denton
the whole time, it didn't matter

31:19.301 --> 31:22.001
what route she took that night -
the ambushers were tracking
Akers!

31:22.034 --> 31:24.901
Well, nobody made you pin it
on Denton, did they?

31:24.934 --> 31:27.601
You arseholes managed
that all by yourselves.

31:27.634 --> 31:30.001
We've got
what we came for, Steve.

31:30.034 --> 31:32.334
Let's leave it at that,
shall we.

31:35.968 --> 31:37.368
Sir.

31:43.068 --> 31:44.434
[Hargreaves] Lock it.

31:46.268 --> 31:47.501
[gate gets closed and locked]

31:55.301 --> 31:57.634
[hatch opens]
[prison officer] Move away
from the door.

31:57.668 --> 31:58.868
[door buzzes]

32:14.001 --> 32:17.268
You'll be escorted off
the premises today.

32:17.301 --> 32:19.668
And how long
will I have with my mum?

32:19.701 --> 32:22.301
The Governor
hasn't given her approval.

32:22.334 --> 32:25.368
This is a Production Order,
to attend a police interview.

32:28.601 --> 32:30.634
[Kate] Returning to
the night of the ambush,

32:30.668 --> 32:33.934
the only officer you disclosed
the operation to was who?

32:33.968 --> 32:37.101
Deputy Chief Constable
Mike Dryden.

32:37.134 --> 32:40.334
DCC Dryden corroborates
receiving your call.

32:40.368 --> 32:42.368
Good.

32:42.401 --> 32:46.268
Was DCC Dryden known to you in
purely a professional capacity?

32:47.301 --> 32:49.001
No, it went beyond that.

32:49.034 --> 32:50.534
[Hastings] This alleged
relationship with

32:50.568 --> 32:52.634
- Deputy Chief Constable Dryden,
- "Alleged"?

32:52.668 --> 32:55.868
Describe this
alleged relationship.

32:58.201 --> 33:00.168
It began when we worked
in Crime Audit together

33:00.201 --> 33:01.468
and ended
a couple of months ago.

33:01.501 --> 33:03.001
[Hastings] And how did it end?

33:03.034 --> 33:04.468
He didn't leave his wife.

33:07.534 --> 33:10.468
He made promises, is that right?

33:10.501 --> 33:12.268
Yeah.

33:12.301 --> 33:14.701
- What kind?
- That he would leave his wife.

33:14.734 --> 33:17.401
[Hastings] (WHISPERS) God,
give me strength.

33:17.434 --> 33:19.568
The issue here is that
an allegation

33:19.601 --> 33:21.568
has been put forward by you,
DI Denton,

33:21.601 --> 33:24.268
that somehow
the Deputy Chief Constable

33:24.301 --> 33:27.034
has set you up to take the blame
for the ambush

33:27.068 --> 33:28.634
that happened on the night
of September 5th.

33:28.668 --> 33:31.001
Now, is that about the top
and bottom of it?

33:31.034 --> 33:33.534
Honestly, sir, I don't know.

33:36.134 --> 33:40.034
And you wouldn't have anything
to substantiate this theory?

33:40.068 --> 33:43.168
I mean, a little thing
called "evidence".

33:43.201 --> 33:45.501
Or is that too much to ask?

33:45.534 --> 33:48.501
I resent your tone,
Superintendent Hastings.

33:48.534 --> 33:51.634
She resents my tone.

33:51.668 --> 33:55.034
If there's been a relationship,
we require corroboration.

33:55.068 --> 33:56.934
Did you ever go to his home?

33:56.968 --> 33:59.301
- No, he came to mine.
- [Steve] Witnesses?

33:59.334 --> 34:01.334
[Lindsay] I doubt it.
We were very discreet.

34:01.368 --> 34:03.201
Hotels?

34:03.234 --> 34:05.134
We visited a place a few times.

34:05.168 --> 34:07.168
I've submitted the details
for you.

34:07.201 --> 34:09.334
Well most places, they insist
on a credit card imprint

34:09.368 --> 34:11.968
- when you check in.
- Mike insisted on using mine,

34:12.001 --> 34:13.701
and then he gave me cash.

34:13.734 --> 34:16.901
- [Steve] So he never used his?
- Not that I recall.

34:16.934 --> 34:19.334
Did he make calls from there
on his mobile or the room phone?

34:19.368 --> 34:21.334
- Yes.
- Good,

34:21.368 --> 34:22.968
we'll find out
if any of the staff remember

34:23.001 --> 34:24.568
both of you being there.

34:24.601 --> 34:26.634
See, the thing is, DI Denton,

34:26.668 --> 34:30.368
that the more intricate
this investigation becomes,

34:30.401 --> 34:32.968
the easier it is for you to try
and confound my team.

34:33.001 --> 34:34.701
But me, I've been round
the block a few times.

34:34.734 --> 34:36.634
I really don't care
if you and the DCC

34:36.668 --> 34:38.501
were swinging
off the chandeliers.

34:38.534 --> 34:42.101
That does not make him
a conspirator. And you maintain

34:42.134 --> 34:44.234
that you've never heard
of the Protected Witness?

34:44.268 --> 34:45.934
- I haven't.
- And

34:45.968 --> 34:47.468
that you've never even met
Akers before?

34:47.501 --> 34:49.134
- No.
- And yet one phone call

34:49.168 --> 34:51.201
from Akers and you
are up to your neck

34:51.234 --> 34:53.334
in all her dodgy
business.

34:53.368 --> 34:56.201
Because I'm a police officer
and she needed my help.

34:57.668 --> 35:00.234
Did you request approval
from DCC Dryden

35:00.268 --> 35:02.568
to proceed without back-up
and without firearms?

35:02.601 --> 35:04.368
I did.

35:04.401 --> 35:06.901
With no recording,
it's your word against his,

35:06.934 --> 35:09.034
isn't it, DI Denton?

35:09.068 --> 35:11.134
My word is I did.

35:15.268 --> 35:18.401
You know what? If you've been
around the block a few times,
sir,

35:18.434 --> 35:21.468
then you tell me,
have you found anything lately

35:21.501 --> 35:22.668
which makes me appear guilty?

35:24.234 --> 35:26.501
Anything?

35:26.534 --> 35:28.168
Or is it starting to look like

35:28.201 --> 35:29.968
you might just have
the wrong person?

35:31.968 --> 35:33.501
Ma'am, all the information
gleaned

35:33.534 --> 35:35.168
from our post-charge
investigation,

35:35.201 --> 35:37.101
- it's going to the CPS.
- [Lindsay] Good.

35:37.134 --> 35:38.534
Then it won't be long
before they realise

35:38.568 --> 35:40.134
there's no credible case
against me.

35:43.301 --> 35:47.434
Look, my mum is very ill.
And as I've cooperated,

35:47.468 --> 35:49.334
I would appreciate any good word
to the Governor

35:49.368 --> 35:52.468
that might persuade her
to permit me a visit, please.

35:57.501 --> 35:58.542
We can look into that.

36:02.545 --> 36:04.512
Okay, we've found something
on the flash-drives,

36:04.545 --> 36:06.345
do you want to take a seat.

36:09.112 --> 36:10.545
[Cottan] Can you play it?

36:12.278 --> 36:14.178
<i>[Tommy] This bloody thing on</i>
<i>or what?</i>

36:15.512 --> 36:17.912
<i>We had a deal.</i>

36:17.945 --> 36:22.545
<i>Immunity from prosecution.</i>
<i>You two-faced bastard.</i>

36:22.578 --> 36:24.612
<i>Does that bastard think</i>
<i>I won't grass?</i>

36:24.645 --> 36:27.445
<i>- [Akers] Which bastard?</i>
<i>- [Tommy] They're all at it.</i>

36:27.478 --> 36:30.045
<i>You show them this.</i>
<i>Then they'll know</i>
<i>who they're dealing with.</i>

36:30.078 --> 36:32.378
<i>- [Akers] Police officers?</i>
<i>- [Tommy] Aye.</i>

36:32.412 --> 36:36.112
<i>From the two-faced bastard,</i>
<i>right down to the Caddy.</i>

36:36.145 --> 36:38.178
<i>[Akers] "The Caddy"?</i>

36:38.212 --> 36:40.478
<i>[Tommy] He's been one of us</i>
<i>since he was a wee laddie.</i>

36:40.512 --> 36:45.478
<i>He's been doing a job</i>
<i>on the inside for years</i>
<i>and years now.</i>

36:45.512 --> 36:47.312
<i>[Akers] What are you</i>
<i>going to do?</i>

36:47.345 --> 36:48.878
<i>[Tommy] Oh you'll find out</i>
<i>soon enough.</i>

36:48.912 --> 36:50.245
<i>And then it will all come out.</i>

36:50.278 --> 36:52.612
Unless this immunity is sorted.

36:54.112 --> 36:55.445
<i>[Tommy] We had a deal.</i>

36:59.278 --> 37:02.345
Right, that was recorded a week
before the ambush.

37:02.378 --> 37:04.345
Proves he was stressed
about his immunity.

37:04.378 --> 37:07.912
- Who's the two-faced bastard?
- Play it.

37:07.945 --> 37:10.845
The 9th of August statement,
previously mentioned.

37:10.878 --> 37:13.278
<i>[Dryden] Resources are</i>
<i>incredibly stretched.</i>

37:13.312 --> 37:17.345
<i>Yet certain police forces</i>
<i>and the courts</i>

37:17.378 --> 37:19.445
<i>collude in granting immunity</i>

37:19.478 --> 37:22.612
from prosecution to individuals
<i>I'd describe</i>

37:22.645 --> 37:24.978
<i>as "repugnant offenders".</i>

37:25.012 --> 37:27.178
<i>Men and women who cost</i>
<i>the taxpayer millions</i>
<i>of pounds,</i>

37:27.212 --> 37:30.178
<i>year on year,</i>
while any right-thinking person

37:30.212 --> 37:32.545
<i>would demand they face justice</i>
<i>for their crimes.</i>

37:32.578 --> 37:35.912
Repugnant offender. I couldn't
have put it better myself.

37:35.945 --> 37:38.245
[Cottan] Deputy Chief
Constable Dryden:

37:38.278 --> 37:40.945
Tommy's "two-faced bastard".

37:40.978 --> 37:43.245
It was Dryden
turning the screws on Tommy.

37:45.045 --> 37:46.912
What about this other officer,
the Caddy?

37:50.978 --> 37:55.445
- Mind if I look into that, sir?
- Yes, off you go Dot, thanks.

37:58.345 --> 38:01.012
Anything else on the files comes
up about this "Caddy",

38:01.045 --> 38:02.378
shoot it over
to my computer yeah,

38:02.412 --> 38:04.512
- ta.
- Okay.

38:04.545 --> 38:06.578
[Kate] If Tommy did have
something on Dryden...

38:06.612 --> 38:09.212
That's a hell of a motive for
Dryden to orchestrate the hit,

38:09.245 --> 38:10.845
and keep it from coming out.

38:12.312 --> 38:13.812
Lindsay was set up.

38:49.445 --> 38:50.978
Steve...

38:54.312 --> 38:56.545
Lindsay's phone records.

38:59.178 --> 39:00.478
[knocking on the door]

39:00.512 --> 39:01.945
Come in.

39:05.012 --> 39:07.878
There are numerous calls
in Denton's phone record,

39:07.912 --> 39:10.178
to and from
Deputy Chief Constable Dryden.

39:10.212 --> 39:12.212
The last was on the evening
of 16th August,

39:12.245 --> 39:14.178
from Dryden's mobile to hers.

39:14.212 --> 39:15.978
I've got the manager
of the hotel confirming

39:16.012 --> 39:17.845
that Denton and Dryden
were semi-regulars.

39:17.878 --> 39:20.412
Double room, sometimes
not even staying the full night.

39:20.445 --> 39:23.178
Next step, we'd like you to
sign off on requests
to access Dryden's phone

39:23.212 --> 39:24.945
and financial records,
please, sir.

39:26.612 --> 39:29.078
Well, there it is plain as day,

39:29.112 --> 39:30.878
the man's an adulterer.

39:32.378 --> 39:34.245
Some people, you wonder
if they've no shame.

39:37.212 --> 39:40.412
[Hastings] Oh well. One for
the morning. Good work, you two.

39:42.378 --> 39:46.112
You sure, sir? It's looking like
Dryden's involved in the ambush.

39:46.145 --> 39:47.945
It's looking like no such thing.

39:47.978 --> 39:50.512
Only that he had an affair
with Denton.

39:50.545 --> 39:52.345
One step at a time.

39:55.545 --> 39:57.212
- Sir.
- Sir.

40:38.212 --> 40:40.412
Number 14, please.

40:43.612 --> 40:44.912
Cheers.

41:22.912 --> 41:25.345
[door closes, engine starts]

41:25.378 --> 41:29.112
- Can I have these off now?
- Against regulations.

41:29.145 --> 41:31.145
We're all very sorry
about your mum, Lindsay.

41:31.178 --> 41:32.512
- Thank you.
- I'll take you to her

41:32.545 --> 41:34.545
straight away.

41:34.578 --> 41:36.312
Can you tell me what's happened?

41:36.345 --> 41:38.845
A CVA. A stroke.

41:38.878 --> 41:41.845
She understands
but she can't talk.

41:46.645 --> 41:47.845
[groans]

42:07.345 --> 42:09.312
Mum?

42:10.245 --> 42:12.178
It's Lindsay.

42:16.445 --> 42:18.578
[mutters unintelligibly]

42:27.078 --> 42:29.012
Thank you.

42:31.312 --> 42:33.212
Kasia says you can understand.

42:37.645 --> 42:41.945
Are you comfortable?
Are you in pain?

42:41.978 --> 42:43.445
Mmmm.

42:46.478 --> 42:49.045
Ring me if you need anything.

42:55.478 --> 42:58.312
Oh, they're just helping me
with work, mum.

42:59.378 --> 43:00.412
[Lindsay's Mum] Mmmm.

43:05.678 --> 43:07.345
[Kate] Dryden's emails
were clean

43:07.378 --> 43:09.145
but this was
from his electronic diary.

43:09.178 --> 43:11.212
16th August, the night
of the traffic offence,

43:11.245 --> 43:14.245
he attended a reception
at City Hall, from 5.00 pm.

43:14.278 --> 43:17.345
According to witnesses,
he left about 7.00 pm.

43:17.378 --> 43:20.345
No further engagements
that evening.

43:20.378 --> 43:23.212
The whole rest of the night,
his whereabouts are unknown.

43:23.245 --> 43:26.345
So what could he have needed
an alibi for?

43:26.378 --> 43:28.145
Run the date
through the database.

44:05.345 --> 44:07.345
Shit.

44:11.312 --> 44:12.978
[dial tone]

44:13.012 --> 44:16.112
4th Street Station, please.
Missing Persons.

44:17.145 --> 44:18.845
[call-waiting tone]

44:21.112 --> 44:22.878
Hi, it's DC Fleming.

44:22.912 --> 44:24.578
I'm calling for an update
on one of your Mispers.

44:24.612 --> 44:29.045
Case number G103734. Kirk.

44:29.078 --> 44:31.078
K-I-R-K.

44:31.112 --> 44:33.278
Carly.

44:33.312 --> 44:35.145
Yeah, it's pretty
straightforward, really.

44:35.178 --> 44:37.245
I just wondered
if there was a formal DNA match

44:37.278 --> 44:40.545
on the body found
under the Canal-side
Industrial Estate.

44:40.578 --> 44:43.512
Yeah, it's not coming up
on my database.

44:46.178 --> 44:48.345
[inaudible response]

44:48.378 --> 44:50.312
Okay, thank you.

44:56.545 --> 44:57.578
[breaths deeply]

45:03.645 --> 45:04.845
[door opens]

45:07.378 --> 45:08.912
Just one minute.

45:43.645 --> 45:46.412
I'm here, mum.

45:46.445 --> 45:48.845
I'm here with you.

45:51.078 --> 45:53.045
[Bob] We left everything
as it was.

45:53.078 --> 45:55.545
That's what the police
told us to do.

45:55.578 --> 45:58.378
Normally what would happen is
control samples of Carly's DNA

45:58.412 --> 46:01.078
would be collected from
her toothbrush or hairbrush.

46:01.112 --> 46:02.912
That's what they did.

46:11.112 --> 46:13.178
I know this is only going to add
to your distress,

46:13.212 --> 46:16.078
but there seems to be a problem
with the samples.

46:16.112 --> 46:17.612
What kind of problem?

46:17.645 --> 46:19.012
Well we're trying to
track them down

46:19.045 --> 46:20.578
and I'm sure we'll find them,

46:20.612 --> 46:23.978
but the more you can tell me,
the better.

46:24.012 --> 46:27.312
A detective came to the house
and took the stuff you said.

46:27.345 --> 46:31.145
Her toiletries. Bedclothes.
Dirty laundry.

46:31.178 --> 46:34.078
It all went in black bin bags
and he took it away.

46:34.112 --> 46:36.445
Normal procedure is for an
officer to be accompanied

46:36.478 --> 46:38.978
by a forensic investigator.

46:39.012 --> 46:41.345
All the material placed
into individual evidence bags

46:41.378 --> 46:44.112
and you'd be asked
to sign a search book.

46:44.145 --> 46:46.145
But we spoke to the police.

46:46.178 --> 46:48.412
They said
they were sending someone.

46:48.445 --> 46:50.112
- You called them?
- Yes.

46:50.145 --> 46:52.012
No.

46:52.045 --> 46:53.912
You remember, Tess? We got
a call from the detective,

46:53.945 --> 46:55.512
saying he was on his way round.

46:55.545 --> 46:57.612
This "detective" -
do you remember his name?

46:57.645 --> 47:00.145
Sorry. He showed his badge
for a fraction of a second.

47:00.178 --> 47:03.545
- Would you recognise him again?
- Yeah.

47:03.578 --> 47:05.145
Yes.

47:05.178 --> 47:07.045
Can you come
to the station with me?

47:07.078 --> 47:08.945
- When?
- Now.

47:20.012 --> 47:21.845
Time.

47:23.278 --> 47:25.312
I thought I could stay?

47:25.345 --> 47:27.345
Do you know
how much a night shift costs?

47:27.378 --> 47:30.178
Would love the overtime.

47:30.212 --> 47:32.012
But what if she...?

47:32.045 --> 47:34.178
You have to leave.
Answering only "Yes" or "No",

47:34.212 --> 47:37.412
- do you understand?
- Yes.

47:43.978 --> 47:47.045
It's alright, mum,
it's just work.

47:49.545 --> 47:52.278
I'll be back to see you
as soon as I can.

48:17.245 --> 48:18.278
[door opens]

48:56.719 --> 48:59.286
[Kate] The detective
that visited you was male?

48:59.319 --> 49:01.786
[Tessa] Yes.

49:01.819 --> 49:03.286
[Kate] Age?

49:03.319 --> 49:07.253
- 25-35, 35-45.
- 25-35.

49:09.319 --> 49:13.286
Ethnicity? White,
Afro-Caribbean, Asian.

49:13.319 --> 49:15.686
Asian.

49:22.419 --> 49:24.753
CCTV of the event
at City Hall attended

49:24.786 --> 49:26.786
by Dryden
on the night of 16th August.

49:26.819 --> 49:28.319
[Cottan] How many tapes we got?

49:28.353 --> 49:30.186
I got them digitised
onto a single disk.

49:30.219 --> 49:31.819
Brilliant.

49:34.986 --> 49:37.986
Why don't I ever get invited
to these do's, eh?

49:42.919 --> 49:44.886
There's Dryden.

49:56.886 --> 49:57.919
[buzzes intercom]

50:00.119 --> 50:02.553
<i>[Regan] (OUT OF INTERCOM)</i>
<i>Do you require assistance?</i>

50:04.053 --> 50:06.386
We have to go back.

50:06.419 --> 50:09.353
<i>That's not possible.</i>

50:09.386 --> 50:12.086
I can't let the last thing
I said be a lie.

50:12.119 --> 50:14.719
We have to go back,
I have to tell her the truth.

50:17.619 --> 50:18.653
[intercom link breaks]

50:20.786 --> 50:22.686
[buzzes intercom twice]

51:33.919 --> 51:36.386
- [Lindsay] What happened?
- Don't do that!

51:36.419 --> 51:38.019
Have you got a phone
you can reach?

51:38.053 --> 51:40.119
- I think so.
- Call the ambulance.

51:41.319 --> 51:43.386
[car engine roaring]

51:43.419 --> 51:46.886
Make the call!
Just make the call!

51:46.919 --> 51:49.253
[Carroll] I can't find my phone!

51:49.286 --> 51:50.319
[brakes screech]

52:15.919 --> 52:17.753
Stop!

Police. where are you?

53:09.319 --> 53:11.186
Are you okay?

53:19.686 --> 53:21.386
Don't be frightened.
Please come out

53:21.419 --> 53:23.986
where we can see you.
You won't be harmed.

53:24.019 --> 53:25.986
She's down here.

53:26.019 --> 53:28.119
Police. Show yourself. Come on.

53:30.419 --> 53:34.019
DI Denton? Is that you, ma'am?

53:34.053 --> 53:36.986
We got a triple-nine call
from your prison officer.

53:37.986 --> 53:40.319
Stop. That's him.

53:42.286 --> 53:44.853
Tessa?

53:44.886 --> 53:48.219
- I think so.
- I know. That's him.

53:49.753 --> 53:53.853
See. Don't be alarmed, ma'am.

54:31.819 --> 54:34.019
Oh, my God.

54:40.019 --> 54:42.119
We'll get you
somewhere safe, ma'am.

54:46.919 --> 54:48.686
Sorry to interrupt.

54:50.153 --> 54:52.019
Carly Kirk's mate
described her boyfriend

54:52.053 --> 54:53.653
as being Asian,

54:53.686 --> 54:55.153
around mid 30's, good looking.

54:55.186 --> 54:57.019
Went by the name of Matt.

54:58.753 --> 55:00.786
Manish Prasad.
He's a serving Vice officer

55:00.819 --> 55:02.619
at Polk Avenue.

55:02.653 --> 55:03.986
And the foster parents
identified him as the one

55:04.019 --> 55:05.653
who came to their house.

55:09.119 --> 55:10.886
And this is one of his team.

55:13.053 --> 55:14.686
Jeremy Cole.

55:22.186 --> 55:23.653
That's him.

55:25.953 --> 55:27.853
Georgia was killed
by one of ours.

- [Kate] I'm sorry, Steve.
- Christ.

55:34.386 --> 55:36.119
We ought to take this
to the gaffer.

55:36.153 --> 55:37.686
Yes, wait.

Hang on.

Right ma'am,
we've got to take you back.

56:05.319 --> 56:08.553
Technically ma'am, you've
escaped from lawful custody.

56:26.053 --> 56:29.253
- Thanks for not handcuffing me.
- It's professional courtesy.

56:32.019 --> 56:34.686
[Cottan] We need to show this
to the Gaffer.

56:36.853 --> 56:38.686
[Kate] Wait. Go back.

56:52.619 --> 56:54.286
[Steve] What?

56:54.319 --> 56:56.053
That's Carly Kirk.

57:18.853 --> 57:20.719
This isn't your vehicle?

57:20.753 --> 57:22.653
We had some problems.
Commandeered this one.

57:22.686 --> 57:24.753
Jump in.

57:24.786 --> 57:26.619
Well let's not do anything
that's going to make me
look bad.

57:26.653 --> 57:28.186
Alright, just radio in,
tell them that I'm cooperating

57:28.219 --> 57:30.919
and we're en route to
the nearest station.
