00:01.460 --> 00:03.838
<i>Previously on</i>
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:04.046 --> 00:05.840
What makes you certain that we cause it?

00:06.007 --> 00:08.884
There was a light from the sky.
Aliens is what I heard.

00:09.051 --> 00:10.928
S.H.I.E.L.D. tried to stop it and failed.

00:11.137 --> 00:12.388
How are you alive?

00:12.680 --> 00:15.891
They killed me.
Brought me back to take my blood.

00:16.058 --> 00:18.561
<i>Phil Coulson is dying,
and you have to let him.</i>

00:20.146 --> 00:23.149
- We found a literal piece of the puzzle.
- This could be our way home.

00:23.315 --> 00:25.401
Yeah, but the shard alone isn't enough.
We need the whole monolith.

00:25.526 --> 00:26.652
All right? I can help.

00:27.987 --> 00:29.572
<i>- What happened?</i>
- He iced her.

00:29.739 --> 00:31.907
- She didn't want to come.
- I'm not leaving anyone behind.

00:32.073 --> 00:33.868
I'm using Enoch to power the machine.

00:35.828 --> 00:37.246
Son of a bitch!

00:37.997 --> 00:39.874
<i>The rock's gonna open.
Get here now!</i>

01:24.126 --> 01:27.797
Sure, why wait for me to answer your knock
when you can just walk right on in?

01:30.716 --> 01:33.219
And why put your phone down,
when you can just be a brainless,

01:33.385 --> 01:34.470
drooling moron?

01:34.970 --> 01:36.722
I always look forward to our chats.

01:38.974 --> 01:40.059
Ears, please.

01:46.398 --> 01:47.733
They're saying
you skipped class yesterday.

01:47.900 --> 01:49.985
- I wasn't in the mood.
- Ruby.

01:50.903 --> 01:53.989
I expect better from you, okay?
This behaviour is not acceptable.

01:54.156 --> 01:55.908
But you're always telling me to stay true
to myself.

01:56.075 --> 01:57.660
So, what if I said my true self
couldn't care less?

01:57.827 --> 01:59.703
Then I'd say get your ass to class,

01:59.870 --> 02:02.081
otherwise you're gonna lose
your damn screen time.

02:06.710 --> 02:07.711
Okay.

02:09.922 --> 02:10.923
Sorry, Mum.

02:14.969 --> 02:17.930
How about I bring us some breakfast, huh?
We haven't done that in a long time.

02:18.097 --> 02:21.225
No, thanks.
But if I do turn 11 again, you got it.

02:24.687 --> 02:25.813
Hey, Mum?

02:28.482 --> 02:29.567
Are you a good guy?

02:31.026 --> 02:32.319
Where did that come from?

02:33.696 --> 02:35.698
Well, you're off
to a strategy meeting, right?

02:36.824 --> 02:38.200
"How to stop S.H.I.E.L.D."?

02:38.868 --> 02:40.953
But up until recently,
everyone rooted for them

02:41.120 --> 02:43.038
and thought that they were
the good guys, so...

02:44.748 --> 02:46.876
are you sure that you're not a bad guy?

02:48.002 --> 02:50.588
- You're obsessed with Daisy Johnson.
- Quake.

02:51.547 --> 02:53.799
- My orders are to capture her.
- Not kill?

02:55.676 --> 02:56.677
Ruby...

03:00.389 --> 03:02.224
This is my assignment.

03:02.975 --> 03:06.270
Okay? And in the adult realm,
we all have to answer to someone.

03:07.146 --> 03:08.147
Even me.

03:10.191 --> 03:12.610
- I do what I must...
- "...what I must, to build a better world

03:12.776 --> 03:14.278
"for the downtrodden citizens."

03:15.196 --> 03:16.447
For you, Ruby.

03:17.656 --> 03:20.326
I do this for you, okay?
So, try to remember that.

03:21.160 --> 03:23.579
When they resurface,
I'll put an end to all of this.

03:24.371 --> 03:26.665
This entire S.H.I.E.L.D. chapter
will be over.

03:44.433 --> 03:47.770
Ah.

03:48.938 --> 03:50.272
Well, that was a hell of a thing.

03:51.649 --> 03:54.777
- I'm so glad you guys made it.
- Why are we still in the Lighthouse?

03:56.070 --> 03:59.573
- Maybe Flint's monolith didn't work?
- So, we find him, try again.

04:01.659 --> 04:02.785
No, it worked.

04:03.953 --> 04:05.955
It takes you through time,
but to the same place.

04:06.121 --> 04:07.748
I've been here before with Enoch.

04:08.999 --> 04:10.668
We made it.

04:10.876 --> 04:12.211
- We're home?
- Yeah.

04:13.545 --> 04:16.257
- Oh, we're home.
- I'm gonna try and find some light.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.177
It's hard to believe we're back.

04:20.636 --> 04:22.763
Find me a double cheese burger,
I'll believe it.

04:29.436 --> 04:31.230
<i>Welcome to the Lighthouse.</i>

04:31.480 --> 04:35.150
<i>The world's last bastion
against the encroaching darkness.</i>

04:35.317 --> 04:39.571
<i>If you're here, you understand the gravity
of the situation.</i>

04:40.364 --> 04:43.158
<i>The world as we know it
has come to an end.</i>

04:44.743 --> 04:47.288
<i>- My name is General Rick Stoner.</i>
- Rick Stoner?

04:47.454 --> 04:49.331
<i>- As you know, certain world events...</i>
- I've heard of him.

04:49.498 --> 04:53.752
<i>...should they occur, trigger what we here
in S.H.I.E.L.D. call Project Reclamation.</i>

04:53.919 --> 04:57.172
<i>This protocol was designed
as a black ops action,</i>

04:57.339 --> 05:00.092
<i>known only to the highest-ranking
S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives.</i>

05:01.593 --> 05:06.390
<i>Once initiated, Project Reclamation
is conducted through secure communications</i>

05:06.598 --> 05:08.309
<i>known as "electronic mail."</i>

05:08.892 --> 05:12.771
<i>Our agents were instructed to gather you,
the selected elite,</i>

05:12.980 --> 05:15.482
<i>- from a host of nations...</i>
- Must never have been initiated.

05:16.108 --> 05:18.527
The 1972 Hydrogen Wave Crisis was averted.

05:18.694 --> 05:20.404
And what, people just forgot
about this place?

05:20.571 --> 05:22.448
There's nothing in Fury's toolbox
about it.

05:23.157 --> 05:25.951
- Mack, those injuries need to be treated.
- I'm fine.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.537
- I'll decide that.
- So will I.

05:28.704 --> 05:32.249
- Well, I'll be there while she decides.
- Let's find a medical station.

05:32.624 --> 05:35.711
Maybe have Simmons look at you too,
Coulson. That's a bad cut.

05:36.420 --> 05:37.671
We can worry about it later.

05:38.088 --> 05:39.882
Actually, I wouldn't mind
checking everyone out.

05:40.049 --> 05:42.259
We did just experience
an unexplored phenomenon.

05:42.426 --> 05:44.803
Worry about it later. You look after Mack.

05:45.179 --> 05:47.723
I'll stay here with Daisy.
When she wakes up, she'll have questions.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.933
When she wakes up,
she's gonna wanna kill you.

05:50.893 --> 05:52.770
<i>I see you've all brought belongings.</i>

05:52.936 --> 05:55.647
<i>Let's put the non-essentials
in the basement storage facility.</i>

05:55.898 --> 05:59.151
<i>There, you will also find the latest
in state-of-the-art technology</i>

05:59.318 --> 06:00.944
<i>- that S.H.I.E.L.D. can offer.</i>
- Good.

06:01.612 --> 06:04.656
We need communications.
May, why don't you take the tour.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.284
- Got it.
<i>- Follow me. This way.</i>

06:08.118 --> 06:10.788
<i>See? Here I am.</i>

06:11.705 --> 06:13.248
<i>- Over here.</i>
- Fitz, you're with me.

06:22.341 --> 06:23.467
You iced me.

06:25.594 --> 06:28.972
Yeah, I was kinda hoping
you'd forget that part.

06:29.181 --> 06:32.309
Sorry to disappoint.

06:37.481 --> 06:40.776
It looks the same, but we're...
We're home, aren't we?

06:40.943 --> 06:43.362
Did you really think, after everything
we've been through, you and me...

06:44.154 --> 06:46.323
that there was any universe
in which I left you behind?

06:46.490 --> 06:50.661
- Even with all of the risks, I...
- Don't care. I need you here.

06:57.209 --> 06:59.128
<i>This S.H.I.E.L.D. technology
will make you think</i>

06:59.294 --> 07:01.964
<i>that the 1980s got here a bit early.</i>

07:03.257 --> 07:06.677
Okay. Not really
a dream-come-true scenario.

07:08.971 --> 07:12.850
There's stuff here we can use...
with some adjustments.

07:13.016 --> 07:14.768
<i>Now,
don't just stand there gawking.</i>

07:14.935 --> 07:16.353
<i>Please follow me into the other room</i>

07:16.520 --> 07:19.231
<i>and deposit your valuables
in the provided lock boxes.</i>

07:19.440 --> 07:22.443
<i>Hey, you in the back,
you wanna try to keep up.</i>

07:22.609 --> 07:23.777
What is it?

07:30.576 --> 07:31.660
Oh.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.540
That's quite unsettling.

07:36.915 --> 07:38.375
Where did they come from?

07:38.625 --> 07:40.252
Unknown.

07:41.170 --> 07:45.466
Ah. Perhaps I should not
have startled you. Hello. I'm Noah.

07:45.757 --> 07:49.136
I'm a sentient Chronicom from a planet
which revolves around a star

07:49.303 --> 07:50.929
- in the constellation...
- Cygnus.

07:51.638 --> 07:53.265
- Got it.
- You're a Chronicom?

07:53.432 --> 07:55.142
- I am.
- Did you know Enoch?

07:55.309 --> 07:59.021
I did. He's the one who alerted me
to the presence of this place.

07:59.563 --> 08:02.649
I'm glad to see you made
your return journey safely, Agent Fitz.

08:05.944 --> 08:08.697
Why are you here? Why are they here?

08:09.865 --> 08:13.076
This bunker was built
with extensive fallout shielding.

08:13.410 --> 08:16.413
Ergo, a secure place
to store unsafe items.

08:16.788 --> 08:20.584
These monoliths are more than unsafe.
No one should get anywhere near them.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.377
The other deciding factor.

08:22.669 --> 08:25.297
Everyone who knows about this bunker
is now inside of it.

08:25.464 --> 08:28.217
So, the world is protected
from these monoliths

08:28.383 --> 08:30.511
and they are protected
from the outside world.

08:30.677 --> 08:33.554
So, the outside world up there
is still safe? Normal, and all that?

08:33.889 --> 08:36.642
For now. Though we are watching
very closely.

08:37.351 --> 08:39.520
Follow me upstairs, I'll show you.

08:45.901 --> 08:49.279
Here, we can monitor
any unusual activity anywhere on Earth.

08:49.738 --> 08:54.660
We Chronicoms monitor the line
between the world and a stranger world.

08:54.993 --> 08:58.247
Yeah, you monitor it...
and do nothing about it.

08:58.455 --> 09:01.750
Yes, we observe without interfering,
unless there is...

09:01.917 --> 09:03.418
- "...an extinction level event."
- "...an extinction level event."

09:03.585 --> 09:05.212
- Yeah, we got it.
- Yes, we know that story.

09:05.921 --> 09:08.924
- What are you observing now?
- Various potential threats.

09:09.299 --> 09:12.302
You'd be surprised how frequently
S.H.I.E.L.D. is mentioned.

09:12.636 --> 09:14.263
We have a small, but active fan base.

09:15.639 --> 09:17.474
There are several events of note.

09:17.891 --> 09:21.478
A well-known politician attempting
to delete his FBI files.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.814
An Asgardian spotted in the city.

09:24.523 --> 09:25.857
And what's this one?

09:27.067 --> 09:29.319
Potential alien contact. Why?

09:29.820 --> 09:32.322
- Does this event mean something to you?
- Yeah.

09:33.991 --> 09:34.992
I think it does.

09:38.161 --> 09:41.123
- A light from the sky.
- Figured you'd be interested.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.625
This is what Voss warned me about.

09:44.585 --> 09:47.212
If he's right, then this is
where it all starts.

09:48.547 --> 09:49.548
Hell on Earth.

09:50.674 --> 09:52.968
And we're back.

10:03.312 --> 10:06.565
- How long since it first appeared?
- It showed up a few weeks ago,

10:06.732 --> 10:09.276
then appeared intermittently
for some time after.

10:09.651 --> 10:12.988
- You think it's alien?
- The wavelength is unusual.

10:13.238 --> 10:14.781
Showed up where?
Where was this?

10:14.906 --> 10:16.074
St Louis, Missouri.

10:16.325 --> 10:18.910
Well, guess we're going
to St Louis, Missouri.

10:19.077 --> 10:21.455
Hunter and I left the Zephyr cloaked
just outside of town.

10:21.830 --> 10:23.081
I can show you where it is.

10:23.498 --> 10:26.460
- Great. But I'm not going.
- What?

10:27.044 --> 10:28.587
I'm responsible for ending the world,

10:28.754 --> 10:31.381
I'd rather not get near one
of the first omens. Hard pass.

10:31.632 --> 10:33.884
- We could use you out there.
- I'll be more useful in here.

10:34.092 --> 10:36.803
I'll run back-end on the mission
with all of Noah's dope-ass equipment.

10:38.096 --> 10:39.473
"Dope-ass" is a...
It's a good thing.

10:39.640 --> 10:40.724
So, what do we do?

10:40.932 --> 10:42.976
Just walk out the front door into town?

10:43.352 --> 10:47.314
Well, we are wanted. After what Fitz said
about General Hale's task force,

10:47.481 --> 10:49.483
- we need to be covert.
- You will be.

10:52.110 --> 10:54.529
The Lighthouse has a few covert entrances.

10:54.905 --> 10:56.657
This place has secret tunnels.

10:57.115 --> 10:59.826
- Like an Agatha Christie novel.
- More like C.H.U.D.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.913
There are a few tunnels,
but this one takes you underground

11:03.080 --> 11:05.248
to the charming little town
of River's End.

11:05.415 --> 11:09.336
- From there, it is up to you.
- No time like the present. Let's go.

11:47.833 --> 11:48.875
Good morning.

11:49.835 --> 11:51.378
We really are home.

12:03.348 --> 12:04.850
We have to get moving.

12:05.642 --> 12:07.185
How about that one, Mack?

12:09.146 --> 12:10.772
- Sure.
- Here comes the catch.

12:10.939 --> 12:12.399
- But there's a catch.
- Come on, we're damn spies.

12:12.566 --> 12:14.234
I think it's admirable of him.

12:14.401 --> 12:17.237
We'll return the van when we're done.
No stealing. I promise.

12:18.488 --> 12:19.489
Okay.

12:24.494 --> 12:25.996
If I'm gonna be holed up here
for a while,

12:26.163 --> 12:27.372
it's good to know that it's fortified.

12:27.539 --> 12:29.458
It's kind of the perfect place
to hide out.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.628
You are typing with my keyboard.

12:34.463 --> 12:37.549
Which is fine, it does not bother me,
even though you did not ask.

12:37.716 --> 12:40.385
- But why are you typing?
- I'm setting up an alert.

12:40.802 --> 12:43.472
Even though my friends have been out
in the world for, like, four minutes,

12:43.638 --> 12:45.182
it'll let me know if one of them
is spotted.

12:45.348 --> 12:48.143
- It has been much longer than four...
- Dramatic effect, Noah.

12:48.894 --> 12:50.937
These things look roomier
from the outside.

12:51.438 --> 12:54.691
- It'll get us where we need to go.
- Hey, could be worse.

12:54.941 --> 12:57.444
True. We could be enslaved
by an alien sociopath

12:57.611 --> 12:58.904
in a dystopian future.

12:59.070 --> 13:02.115
Or we could be trapped
inside a virtual-reality fascist state.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.784
Or stuck at the bottom of the ocean.

13:04.576 --> 13:07.329
- Or stopping a crazy robot lady.
- Or falling out of a plane.

13:07.746 --> 13:10.165
- Fighting Daisy's mum.
- Or fighting Daisy's dad.

13:10.332 --> 13:11.500
Or dancing.

13:14.211 --> 13:15.295
Wait.

13:16.546 --> 13:19.466
We're not just wanted. We're most wanted.

13:20.926 --> 13:23.345
- Top of the lists. All the lists.
- Yes.

13:23.512 --> 13:26.223
It seems you are the object
of much interest right now.

13:26.848 --> 13:28.767
Every local PD has our picture.

13:29.976 --> 13:32.062
Which means, to anyone with a badge...

13:33.063 --> 13:34.189
we're famous.

13:50.789 --> 13:52.332
Everyone just stay calm.

14:03.510 --> 14:06.096
- Hi, Officer. Is there a problem?
- You tell me.

14:07.138 --> 14:09.432
Oh, this right here? No, I was sparring.

14:10.141 --> 14:12.310
No, I mean, the van.
This is John Nickel's van.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.772
Mm. Yeah, yeah.

14:20.694 --> 14:22.153
I mean, is it a clunker or what?

14:22.612 --> 14:24.447
'Cause he's been trying to sell it
for months.

14:25.574 --> 14:28.785
Hey, be honest. How badly
did he fleece you on this?

14:31.079 --> 14:32.163
Are you kidding me?

14:32.664 --> 14:36.042
You know how long I've been looking
for a 1975 T-2 1600 engine

14:36.209 --> 14:37.836
with shag carpeting?

14:38.920 --> 14:42.424
John's price was more than fair.
It was a steal.

14:43.258 --> 14:45.385
- First time for everything, I guess.
- Yeah, yeah.

14:46.636 --> 14:49.139
- You guys have a great day.
- You too.

14:49.681 --> 14:50.682
Thank you.

14:55.770 --> 14:57.272
That's closer than I would have liked.

15:00.150 --> 15:01.776
We're lucky this is a quiet,
simple town.

15:02.444 --> 15:04.321
We don't make any noise,
we can keep it that way.

15:29.763 --> 15:31.014
Oh, boy.

15:40.732 --> 15:42.150
You gotta be kidding me.

16:00.835 --> 16:02.963
- Not from here.
- Hey, I get it.

16:03.588 --> 16:07.008
- It's a pretty tree.
- Yeah, I've never seen anything like it.

16:07.425 --> 16:10.512
Yeah, that'll probably stop
when whatever you took wears off.

16:50.260 --> 16:51.970
Hey, I did get some of it right.

16:58.143 --> 17:00.895
Barkeep...

17:01.104 --> 17:03.648
I'd like to try a beer.
A real one, please.

17:04.273 --> 17:06.526
One real beer. You got it.

17:21.875 --> 17:22.876
Mm...

17:23.376 --> 17:27.964
Oh, God! That does not
taste like it looks.

17:28.715 --> 17:31.301
Do you have anything else
that's like this, but...

17:32.427 --> 17:33.428
delicious?

17:34.512 --> 17:35.638
Yeah.

18:16.471 --> 18:17.555
Mm.

18:22.393 --> 18:23.436
Oh!

18:47.293 --> 18:49.212
Just need you to settle up, buddy.

18:49.587 --> 18:53.508
- Oh. Right. Yeah. Settle up what?
- Your tab. You forgot to pay.

18:54.092 --> 18:58.096
Ah! Right. Okay, sorry, here you go.

19:00.431 --> 19:03.852
We take credit cards or cash.
Whatever works best for you.

19:05.186 --> 19:06.187
Right.

19:06.437 --> 19:10.108
Credit cards or cash, 'cause that's how
people pay for things here. Now. Here.

19:11.901 --> 19:12.986
Okay.

19:18.032 --> 19:22.036
- Dude.
- No, it's okay, man. I'm from the future.

19:59.991 --> 20:03.494
- How do you feel?
- Like I've never loved gravity more.

20:06.206 --> 20:09.083
Hey, maybe you should have
Simmons take a look.

20:09.250 --> 20:10.877
I'm fine. Just a headache.

20:12.420 --> 20:14.589
Sir? I think we found something.

20:17.342 --> 20:19.802
You got a location
where that light is pointing?

20:20.261 --> 20:24.349
It's an Aerospace Industries Laboratory.
It just seemed a bit serendipitous.

20:24.515 --> 20:25.725
Yeah, so it got me thinking,

20:25.892 --> 20:27.894
we were assuming we were seeing a light
coming down from the sky.

20:28.061 --> 20:29.646
- But we're not.
- Well, it only looks like that

20:29.812 --> 20:31.231
because of the frame rate. It's like...

20:31.439 --> 20:34.567
how a strobe can make dripping water
look like it's moving upwards.

20:34.984 --> 20:37.111
So, if I adjust the frames per second...

20:40.698 --> 20:42.867
- It's being sent from Earth.
- Yeah.

20:43.284 --> 20:45.203
So, once we saw that, we knew what it was.

20:45.370 --> 20:49.082
Noah said the wavelength was unusual.
He was right, but it's also familiar.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.294
This is the beacon Hive used, sir...

20:54.796 --> 20:56.172
to call the Kree to Earth.

20:58.341 --> 20:59.801
Now, someone's using it again.

21:03.179 --> 21:04.514
I know what's got you worried.

21:06.891 --> 21:10.311
- No, it's just...
- "How will I ever find job satisfaction

21:10.478 --> 21:12.438
"without crushing rocks
for no good reason?"

21:12.605 --> 21:14.107
Am I right?

21:14.607 --> 21:16.442
It's like you can read my mind.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.577
Hey.

21:28.246 --> 21:29.747
A lot of stuff happened.

21:30.832 --> 21:32.834
I mean, Kasius was toying with us.

21:33.751 --> 21:36.129
- And we don't know what we saw back there.
- I do.

21:37.213 --> 21:40.550
She said things. Upsetting things.

21:41.175 --> 21:43.720
Kasius was using her to mess with you.

21:44.721 --> 21:48.224
Or he was using her to mess with me.
I mean, we can't let her rattle us.

21:49.225 --> 21:50.685
And what if I can't let it go?

21:54.105 --> 21:56.149
Uh. Well, look at it like this.

21:58.026 --> 21:59.777
We're gonna change the future anyway.

22:01.404 --> 22:02.655
I hope we do.

22:03.698 --> 22:05.033
He was crazy.

22:05.450 --> 22:08.244
But we can't let him in our heads.
We need our heads in the game.

22:10.705 --> 22:12.415
Both of us. Right?

22:13.458 --> 22:14.459
Yeah.

22:16.085 --> 22:17.920
Okay.

22:19.881 --> 22:21.674
Who knows what's true
and what's not, right?

22:21.841 --> 22:22.884
That's right.

22:26.387 --> 22:28.222
Now...

22:29.182 --> 22:31.476
do I need to find a giant rock
so you can crush it?

22:31.642 --> 22:33.436
Hm?

22:35.021 --> 22:36.898
Baby, I don't need a rock to crush it.

22:37.357 --> 22:40.651
Oh...
No, you do not.

23:01.130 --> 23:04.509
Rick Stoner, you mad genius.

23:09.847 --> 23:11.265
What was that noise?

23:11.808 --> 23:13.935
It's the alert that I set up, but this...

23:16.020 --> 23:17.438
This is impossible.

23:18.147 --> 23:19.690
No, no, no, no, no, no.

23:20.108 --> 23:22.068
This man is unfamiliar to me.

23:22.235 --> 23:25.571
I know him, but from where we all
just were, he... he can't be here.

23:26.072 --> 23:28.366
I mean, he cannot be around the cops.

23:28.866 --> 23:31.702
You're concerned he will alert
the authorities to your presence?

23:31.869 --> 23:35.540
We're the only people that he knows
in this time. He could tell them that.

23:37.208 --> 23:39.752
You have to go get him out of lockup.
I obviously can't go.

23:39.919 --> 23:41.587
I cannot. That would be interfering

23:41.754 --> 23:45.007
- with the natural course of...
- You people literally kidnapped us

23:45.174 --> 23:46.467
and then took us to another time.

23:46.634 --> 23:49.846
As has been thoroughly explained,
that was an extinction-level event.

23:53.182 --> 23:54.809
Also, it was Enoch.

23:55.977 --> 23:59.397
Enoch is very reckless.
But you know this, you've met him.

24:06.654 --> 24:08.865
Fine. I'll go.

24:12.243 --> 24:14.245
But first, I'm gonna need your clothes.

24:38.352 --> 24:39.854
Still not a soul.

24:40.771 --> 24:43.608
Facing no opposition is usually
a good thing, but this...

24:44.317 --> 24:45.693
Yeah, it's giving me the creeps.

24:46.110 --> 24:48.237
It's a firewall.
An actual firewall.

24:48.404 --> 24:49.822
It's a safety protocol.

24:51.741 --> 24:53.534
Fitz, signs of life?

25:01.667 --> 25:05.379
Wait, hang on. There's someone in there,
and they're alone.

25:12.595 --> 25:13.596
Now.

25:19.477 --> 25:22.146
- Not another step, or I'll...
- Piper?

25:24.106 --> 25:25.441
Hey, guys.

25:30.321 --> 25:33.324
I don't know how the exact people I needed
to show up just showed up, but...

25:33.491 --> 25:35.993
- thank you, universe.
- The feeling's mutual, trust me.

25:36.494 --> 25:38.913
- What are you doing here?
- Same thing as you, probably.

25:39.664 --> 25:41.499
That thing's about to fire up again.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.292
I don't know how to stop it.

25:51.717 --> 25:54.053
I'm saying that it's impossible
to imagine anything

25:54.220 --> 25:56.472
that you can't imagine.
Like, I couldn't imagine food

25:56.639 --> 25:58.766
that was shaped like animals.
Like that was...

25:59.141 --> 26:01.852
It totally caught me by surprise. I...

26:02.019 --> 26:06.983
Look, I get that you're not believing
my story, sure. But I've got friends.

26:07.149 --> 26:09.485
I've got friends
in really high government places.

26:09.652 --> 26:12.321
We just need to get to them,
and then they can smooth this all out.

26:13.656 --> 26:15.324
- Hi, there.
- Yes?

26:15.825 --> 26:19.912
Um. Chief Wellins, is it?
I'm here for Deke Shaw over there.

26:20.079 --> 26:21.330
I'm his state-assigned social worker.

26:21.497 --> 26:25.459
He didn't mention a social worker
was supervising him. Your name?

26:26.836 --> 26:29.255
Sinara. Sinara Smith.

26:30.089 --> 26:32.508
- It's Portuguese.
- Sinara. Not Smith.

26:32.675 --> 26:34.885
He wandered off during a day trip.
My apologies.

26:35.052 --> 26:36.554
- He was out of control.
- Yeah.

26:36.721 --> 26:39.181
- Says you.
- He's not even my toughest customer,

26:39.348 --> 26:42.852
believe me. He's just a little slippery.

26:43.477 --> 26:46.355
If you check online, you'll see
that I sent out an alert when I lost him.

26:48.065 --> 26:50.526
What are Mr Shaw's issues?

26:50.693 --> 26:53.696
I mean, how much time do you have, sir?

26:54.071 --> 26:57.742
Uh... Complex neurological deficiencies.
Low...

26:58.576 --> 27:01.746
Low IQ. Poor motor skills.

27:01.954 --> 27:05.207
Oh. He hasn't... uh, soiled himself today,
has he?

27:05.374 --> 27:09.128
No, but he was quite inebriated.
He told us he was saving the world.

27:09.545 --> 27:12.089
- Hm. Imagine that.
- Not the first guy we've picked up

27:12.256 --> 27:13.466
who's made big claims.

27:14.342 --> 27:16.761
It seems like you've got your work
cut out for you with this one.

27:16.927 --> 27:18.804
Chief, you have no idea.

27:25.269 --> 27:27.521
You look like you're ready to suit up
for battle.

27:27.688 --> 27:30.191
We just got a call, ma'am.
S.H.I.E.L.D. has been spotted.

27:31.317 --> 27:32.318
Orders?

27:33.486 --> 27:34.528
Keep them there.

27:42.620 --> 27:45.623
I can't tell you how relieved I am
to see you all. In one piece.

27:45.915 --> 27:47.833
So, what happened?
How'd you end up here?

27:48.000 --> 27:50.044
Yeah, and last we saw you,
you haloed out of the Zephyr.

27:50.211 --> 27:52.922
With instructions that if the fight
didn't go your way, I'd tell your story.

27:53.089 --> 27:54.632
Make sure Aida and the Russian
didn't get away with it.

27:54.799 --> 27:56.801
- Ivanov.
- Yeah, but I never heard

27:56.967 --> 27:58.094
which way it went.

27:58.427 --> 28:00.846
No news. No confirmation if...

28:01.597 --> 28:03.432
- If we were dead?
- Yeah, that.

28:04.016 --> 28:06.102
So, I looked for you. Everywhere.

28:06.268 --> 28:08.145
Safe houses, any S.H.I.E.L.D. contacts
I could find.

28:08.729 --> 28:10.731
- I even had eyes on your families.
- Great.

28:10.898 --> 28:12.733
One more thing for my mother
to be paranoid about.

28:12.900 --> 28:15.778
I was stealth. Hey, let's not forget,
I'm most wanted too, you know?

28:16.195 --> 28:17.613
So, where on Earth were you hiding?

28:18.906 --> 28:21.617
Well, technically, it was Earth.

28:22.368 --> 28:24.495
Story for another time. Go on.

28:25.162 --> 28:26.706
I had my eye on every news outlet.

28:26.872 --> 28:29.792
Anything that looked like you guys getting
into trouble, or out of it.

28:30.292 --> 28:31.919
Saw a report about a light coming
from the sky.

28:32.086 --> 28:33.379
And you recognised the beacon?

28:33.838 --> 28:37.174
- Well, even took Fitz-Simmons a few hours.
- Yeah, well, let's not forget,

28:37.341 --> 28:40.428
that was my first mission to Union City
with you all. Called up from the minors.

28:40.594 --> 28:44.932
It was a big day for me. Plus, aliens,
you know, they leave an impression.

28:45.349 --> 28:47.017
You have no idea.

28:47.351 --> 28:49.437
So, you came here to warn the staff.

28:49.603 --> 28:52.982
Yeah, and to kick the blue ass of anything
that showed up. I was trained well.

28:54.608 --> 28:56.318
They had the beacon here
on government contract.

28:56.485 --> 28:58.988
Just examining it, and it turned on.
Totally random.

28:59.321 --> 29:01.532
- Did they try to shut it down?
- Yeah, they couldn't.

29:01.699 --> 29:04.201
And I don't do science,
so I sent everyone away.

29:04.368 --> 29:07.204
Well, Fitz-Simmons will figure it out.
Hm. Eventually.

29:07.455 --> 29:09.915
Yeah. Question is...
how long is eventually?

29:10.249 --> 29:12.084
Yeah. Could be too late.

29:25.765 --> 29:27.767
So, yeah, if you check
River's End PD online account,

29:27.933 --> 29:30.519
you'll see that I went ahead
and took care of Mr Shaw's bail.

29:30.728 --> 29:35.858
What did we discuss
about wandering off without permission?

29:38.486 --> 29:41.989
- Don't wander off without permission.
- Don't... Exactly, we went over this.

29:42.156 --> 29:44.408
Uh. I also went ahead
and made a small contribution

29:44.575 --> 29:47.661
to the department's charity fund
to thank you for your trouble.

29:47.828 --> 29:50.581
Truth is, I have no desire
to keep drunks here in the office.

29:50.998 --> 29:54.502
You should go, but take better care
of your charges, Ms Smith.

29:54.668 --> 29:56.504
Yes, Chief. Thank you. Of course.

29:58.756 --> 29:59.799
Hold on!

30:02.051 --> 30:03.052
Yeah?

30:03.594 --> 30:05.763
There's still paperwork
you need to fill out.

30:06.597 --> 30:08.682
Yeah, of course. Whatever you need.

30:16.524 --> 30:17.691
- Dude.
- I know.

30:17.858 --> 30:19.276
There's just so much paperwork, right?

30:20.903 --> 30:23.447
Oh, you probably meant
how did I get here? Well, I don't know.

30:23.614 --> 30:25.533
I was with the monolith,
and there was a shard,

30:25.699 --> 30:27.952
and I turned the machine on,
and then the rock turned to liquid,

30:28.118 --> 30:31.372
and then there was, like, buzzing, dizzy,
and pushing and pulling,

30:31.580 --> 30:33.123
but then bang, Zima!

30:33.999 --> 30:37.419
How do you show up in another time
and, like, immediately get arrested?

30:37.586 --> 30:39.046
Have you even tried Zima?

30:42.049 --> 30:44.969
Thank you. I thought they might've gotten
you to talk about us or something.

30:45.135 --> 30:47.680
What? No. I...
I know you guys are covert.

30:47.847 --> 30:50.057
I'm not gonna talk about you.
You forget, I survived the Kree.

30:50.224 --> 30:51.892
Yeah, by ratting people out.

30:53.936 --> 30:57.439
Yes, true, that did happen,
but not this time.

30:57.606 --> 30:59.608
I thought you'd be, like,
emotionally distraught or something.

30:59.775 --> 31:04.071
Emotionally distraught? This is awesome!
I thought that I was gonna die.

31:04.530 --> 31:06.407
But instead, I'm about to go
for a walk outside.

31:06.574 --> 31:09.076
Also, there is an outside!

31:09.493 --> 31:11.412
I was walking here, and yes,
I was pretty drunk,

31:11.579 --> 31:15.708
but I saw in a store window
there was these green apples, and steaks,

31:15.875 --> 31:17.626
and this thing called gummy bears.

31:18.168 --> 31:21.881
You know, what people aren't eating here
is sterilisation pellets.

31:22.131 --> 31:23.716
- I love this place so much.
- Okay, yeah,

31:23.883 --> 31:25.801
but it's not all fun and games, okay?
So...

31:27.720 --> 31:29.805
Great. So, just this
and then we're free to go?

31:30.514 --> 31:31.974
That, and I'll need a number
where I can reach you,

31:32.141 --> 31:33.309
so we can follow up.

31:34.935 --> 31:35.978
No problem.

31:43.444 --> 31:45.905
- Think I've got it.
- Makes me look like an idiot.

31:46.196 --> 31:47.448
You've taken on a lot alone.

31:47.615 --> 31:49.491
Yeah, but you guys don't look like
you've been on vacation.

31:49.950 --> 31:51.285
When do I get the download?

31:55.581 --> 31:57.333
Power source was being set off by this.

31:57.583 --> 31:59.585
It's a bimetallic thermal
expansion trigger.

32:01.003 --> 32:03.297
Well, that...
Basically, it's a timer.

32:04.465 --> 32:06.133
- Looks man-made.
- Yeah, it is.

32:06.383 --> 32:09.345
Everything else in here is new to me.
This was installed by hand.

32:09.762 --> 32:12.932
- A little sloppily, if you ask me.
- I told you. I don't do science.

32:18.020 --> 32:19.939
Relax, no one needs to get hurt.

32:29.448 --> 32:30.491
What is this?

32:40.084 --> 32:43.420
- I'm sorry. Hey, I'm most wanted too.
- You cut a deal?

32:44.004 --> 32:47.841
- You're saying the beacon...
- The beacon wasn't meant to call aliens.

32:48.592 --> 32:49.885
It was meant to call you.

32:55.975 --> 32:57.267
Drop your weapon.

33:14.660 --> 33:16.996
The guns are just so nobody does
anything stupid.

33:17.162 --> 33:19.123
- Too late for that.
- Piper, why?

33:19.289 --> 33:20.666
I followed your orders.

33:21.458 --> 33:26.171
Truthfully, I thought you were dead.
When they nabbed me, I told your story.

33:26.547 --> 33:28.465
- To General Hale.
- Everything.

33:28.924 --> 33:33.512
Ivanov, Radcliffe, LMDs, Framework.
Look, Hale knows you're not guilty.

33:34.304 --> 33:37.433
She guaranteed your safety.
She just... She wanted to bring you in.

33:37.933 --> 33:39.351
You don't have to run anymore.

33:42.187 --> 33:43.188
Your orders?

33:46.108 --> 33:47.317
Kill them.

34:08.797 --> 34:11.341
- Guaranteed our safety?
- What...?

34:20.559 --> 34:23.062
No, it's "Do not engage."
It's capture, not kill.

34:23.228 --> 34:24.605
Looks a lot like kill.

34:29.818 --> 34:31.652
They're not human! Go for the face!

34:33.072 --> 34:35.449
- You were trained better than this.
- No, Hale is an ally.

34:35.616 --> 34:38.534
Talbot's in a coma,
she's general in command. I thought...

34:38.744 --> 34:41.413
No, she's US military.
Look, I just wanted to help.

34:41.580 --> 34:42.581
And you got played.

34:48.003 --> 34:49.463
We have to take this thing
and get out of here

34:49.630 --> 34:51.297
before we're all killed.
Are you gonna help?

34:57.429 --> 34:59.556
Piper, pick a side, but we're going.

35:01.558 --> 35:02.684
I'll cover you.

35:12.528 --> 35:13.862
Mack!

35:30.254 --> 35:31.380
Yo-Yo! Yo-Yo!

35:41.181 --> 35:42.474
Go. Go.

35:52.609 --> 35:53.986
Hold on, we're gonna get you
to the hospital.

35:54.153 --> 35:55.279
It's too risky.

35:55.529 --> 35:56.655
<i>Confia</i> Jemma.

35:57.447 --> 35:59.408
We're right here.

36:06.081 --> 36:07.207
I'm so sorry.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.251
It's all coming true.

36:14.339 --> 36:16.383
Okay, fancy stuff, here we go.

36:17.301 --> 36:18.886
You don't know what any of this is,
do you?

36:19.178 --> 36:20.179
I know computers.

36:22.431 --> 36:25.309
- These are computers, right?
- Hello. I'm Noah.

36:25.475 --> 36:28.145
I believe saving you from imprisonment
was wrong.

36:28.395 --> 36:31.315
Oh. All right, cool. Well, you seem fun.

36:31.481 --> 36:33.692
<i>Daisy. Daisy,
come in. We need to land.</i>

36:33.859 --> 36:35.068
<i>Somewhere close, and fast.</i>

36:35.235 --> 36:37.196
May, yeah, I've got a surprise for you.

36:37.362 --> 36:41.158
- Rick Stoner put in a...
<i>- Send me the coordinates, now!</i>

36:42.034 --> 36:46.246
- May? You guys okay?
<i>- Hurry, Daisy. Please.</i>

38:51.663 --> 38:52.789
You're late.

38:54.458 --> 38:57.002
Perhaps you'd like to explain
what the hell happened out there.

38:59.212 --> 39:00.589
I forced their hand.

39:02.049 --> 39:03.342
Is this some sort of joke to you?

39:03.508 --> 39:05.260
They're gonna have
to seek medical attention.

39:05.427 --> 39:07.429
Now maybe that's gonna get them
right where we want them.

39:07.596 --> 39:08.597
No, we had them

39:08.764 --> 39:11.933
- right where we wanted them.
- We didn't have Daisy Johnson.

39:12.100 --> 39:16.146
- You promised me Daisy Johnson.
- She didn't show up tonight.

39:16.313 --> 39:19.358
Well, I think if I keep cutting
her friends' arms off, she will.

39:22.527 --> 39:26.448
Your work is sloppy and incomplete,
and you've been trained to do better.

39:26.656 --> 39:29.368
- Which is why you don't skip class.
- Does it matter?

39:30.786 --> 39:33.246
- They took the beacon.
- The beacon was a back-up.

39:33.955 --> 39:34.956
A prop.

39:35.665 --> 39:36.792
You're my daughter.

39:38.668 --> 39:39.795
And a disappointment.

39:46.843 --> 39:49.888
At least the beacon will do
what it's supposed to do.

40:08.824 --> 40:09.866
Fitz...

40:10.742 --> 40:12.953
- I just wanted to make sure...
- Yeah, we scanned for signals before

40:13.120 --> 40:15.580
- we landed. We're not being tracked.
- Okay, good.

40:15.831 --> 40:18.667
We're just waiting
for the internal circuitry to cool down.

40:18.917 --> 40:22.879
- Just takes a lot to power this thing.
- But it is not cooling down.

40:23.964 --> 40:25.799
- How is... How is she?
- Still no word.

40:26.174 --> 40:29.177
- Jemma's in with her now.
- In fact, it is heating up.

40:31.012 --> 40:33.348
- Run.
- What?

40:34.349 --> 40:37.727
Run. Go. Go, now!

41:17.976 --> 41:18.977
Mr Creel.

41:22.439 --> 41:23.857
Figured I'd see you again soon.

41:24.524 --> 41:27.194
Yes, well, I told you I'd find you
once S.H.I.E.L.D. showed up again.

41:27.569 --> 41:31.323
I told you, I'm not interested
in being the government's hired gun.

41:32.115 --> 41:35.702
I'm done with that.
Didn't do Talbot any good.

41:35.869 --> 41:38.330
Yes, well, I'm not interested
in a hired gun.

41:40.207 --> 41:42.125
I'm putting together a team.
