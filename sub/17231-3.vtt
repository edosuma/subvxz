00:01.673 --> 00:05.506
Behold Octomom the Voodoo Doll.

00:05.541 --> 00:07.176
Not bad, considering.

00:07.210 --> 00:09.978
I would dominate on "Project Runway."

00:10.012 --> 00:11.813
Stick it in her ankle.

00:11.847 --> 00:15.183
Nothing permanent. Just enough to
take her out of the competition.

00:15.218 --> 00:19.320
I'm afraid to even ask, but what
are you fools doing over there?

00:19.889 --> 00:21.634
They're casting "Dancing with the Stars."

00:21.668 --> 00:25.626
The final spot is between me and Octomom.

00:25.677 --> 00:27.678
Delivery for Holly Hamilton.

00:27.712 --> 00:30.214
Ooh, my office supplies.

00:30.248 --> 00:31.959
Oh, good. Did you order more toner?

00:32.033 --> 00:33.517
Better.

00:38.490 --> 00:41.192
I need a boy's opinion.
What do you think, Joe?

00:41.226 --> 00:43.494
I think maybe you should
wear 'em on a date with me.

00:43.528 --> 00:46.997
See? These office supplies
are already working.

00:48.333 --> 00:50.434
- Okay, what's your sign?
- Aries.

00:50.468 --> 00:52.203
Ooh, pass.

00:52.237 --> 00:54.571
My psychic says I can't
go out with fire signs.

00:54.606 --> 00:56.139
I might get burned.

00:56.575 --> 00:59.209
Does she charge extra for puns?

00:59.678 --> 01:01.478
Eh, it was worth a shot.

01:05.550 --> 01:07.585
You turned him down?

01:07.619 --> 01:09.921
I would totally call him

01:09.955 --> 01:13.224
when I absolutely, positively
needed it overnight.

01:13.258 --> 01:15.459
Nick, that falls under
"Inappropriate Office Banter."

01:15.493 --> 01:16.393
Put a dollar in the can.

01:16.428 --> 01:18.596
Go, go, go.

01:18.630 --> 01:20.832
And you... I can't believe
you just turned that guy down

01:20.866 --> 01:22.366
because of something your psychic said.

01:22.400 --> 01:24.368
You can't argue with science,

01:24.402 --> 01:26.653
or psychics, or Oprah.

01:26.688 --> 01:28.522
Okay, Oprah maybe,

01:28.573 --> 01:30.324
but it drives me nuts

01:30.358 --> 01:32.526
that you believe in all that other stuff.

01:32.528 --> 01:34.661
Well, I think it's sad you
don't believe in anything.

01:34.696 --> 01:38.365
Except toner, which
you won't shut up about.

01:38.416 --> 01:40.434
I believe in plenty of other things.

01:40.468 --> 01:42.452
Just things I can actually see.

01:42.504 --> 01:45.639
I can see myself delivering my
own package to that delivery guy.

01:47.509 --> 01:50.627
Inappropriate Office Banter. Dollar. Can.

01:50.678 --> 01:54.381
I'm gonna put in a 20.
I'm feeling saucy today.

02:14.502 --> 02:16.570
I know it sounds nutty... "Haunted House,"

02:16.621 --> 02:19.406
but is there any way I can
convince you to take this case?

02:19.408 --> 02:22.242
The supernatural is not
something we normally do.

02:22.293 --> 02:23.493
I can pay $2,000.

02:23.545 --> 02:25.579
But it's a field we've
always wanted to break into.

02:26.714 --> 02:28.549
Sorry I'm late.

02:28.583 --> 02:30.417
My neighbor forgot to close his curtains.

02:31.586 --> 02:33.720
Get me up to speed in
your best narrator voice.

02:33.755 --> 02:36.340
"Previously on 'Mystery Girls'..."

02:36.391 --> 02:38.258
Henry contacted the girls

02:38.309 --> 02:40.310
because he bought a
vacation home in Big Bear,

02:40.345 --> 02:42.512
but his new wife refuses to move in

02:42.564 --> 02:44.398
believing it to be haunted by the ghost

02:44.432 --> 02:45.432
of a previous occupant.

02:45.483 --> 02:46.600
What an episode!

02:48.436 --> 02:49.519
Tell me more.

02:49.571 --> 02:52.439
That's about it. I hope you can help.

02:52.441 --> 02:53.440
I came to you first

02:53.491 --> 02:55.609
because my wife is such a huge fan.

02:55.611 --> 02:58.278
Ooh, how huge?

02:58.329 --> 03:00.364
She knows every episode by heart.

03:00.415 --> 03:01.615
Her favorite is the one where you joined

03:01.617 --> 03:03.533
an all-girl biker gang

03:03.585 --> 03:06.286
and broke up that
counterfeit lipstick cartel.

03:07.623 --> 03:10.257
Your wife is getting her episodes mixed up.

03:10.291 --> 03:12.459
The biker gang was pimping
out blind prostitutes

03:12.510 --> 03:14.519
the lipstick cartel was being run by

03:14.554 --> 03:16.605
those evil beach volleyball players

03:16.639 --> 03:18.557
Tad and Thad.

03:18.608 --> 03:21.643
Trust me. My wife knows
what she's talking about.

03:21.645 --> 03:24.646
Trust me. So do I.

03:24.681 --> 03:26.648
Oh yeah?

03:26.699 --> 03:28.650
Do you have an official
"Mystery Girls" fan club card,

03:28.652 --> 03:30.652
because I do. I mean, my wife does.

03:32.405 --> 03:34.456
Okay, fine. I'm the super fan.

03:34.490 --> 03:35.657
- Hey!
- Yes!

03:37.377 --> 03:39.328
Mystery solved.

03:39.330 --> 03:41.413
Wait. Your wife exists, right?

03:41.464 --> 03:43.332
You're not here just to meet us?

03:43.366 --> 03:45.334
No, no, everything else is true.

03:45.385 --> 03:47.636
Okay, pal, what are we talkin' about?

03:47.670 --> 03:49.671
Ghost lights, poltergeists,

03:49.673 --> 03:51.640
dark energies?

03:51.674 --> 03:54.676
I'm impressed. So you'll take the case?

03:54.727 --> 03:56.345
Nope.

03:56.396 --> 03:58.680
Come on. Please. I'll tell you what...

03:58.731 --> 04:01.566
The house is full of
antiques that my wife hates,

04:01.601 --> 04:03.685
if there's something you
want, pick it out, it's yours.

04:03.736 --> 04:06.438
Oh, I love it. It's
like "Antiques Road Show"

04:06.489 --> 04:08.240
meets "Ghost Hunters." We're in!

04:09.575 --> 04:11.443
Thank you for indulging me.

04:11.494 --> 04:13.278
My wife will be very relieved.

04:13.329 --> 04:16.281
Happy wife, happy life, am I right?

04:19.702 --> 04:22.337
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

04:22.372 --> 04:25.340
Is Nick not really gay?

04:25.375 --> 04:26.708
No. This is amazing.

04:26.759 --> 04:29.378
$2,000 to go on a treasure hunt

04:29.429 --> 04:31.546
- and have a sleep-over.
- Wait, what?

04:31.597 --> 04:35.384
- We're sleeping over?
- Yes, it'll be fun!

04:35.386 --> 04:36.551
Haunted House Party!

04:36.602 --> 04:38.687
We'll rent "Beetlejuice," make cocktails,

04:38.721 --> 04:40.722
and I'll do the "Thriller" dance.

04:47.463 --> 04:49.431
Wow. We found the one gay man

04:49.465 --> 04:50.732
who doesn't know how to
do the "Thriller" dance.

04:50.734 --> 04:52.284
Awesome.

05:11.287 --> 05:12.587
I'm sensing there's a problem.

05:12.638 --> 05:15.507
I just don't think we should
go messin' with ghosts.

05:15.558 --> 05:17.259
Honey, there are no ghosts.

05:17.261 --> 05:19.494
- In that house?
- In the world.

05:21.481 --> 05:23.265
Okay, that's your opinion,

05:23.316 --> 05:25.317
but the truth is, we don't know

05:25.351 --> 05:27.436
what we don't know.

05:27.438 --> 05:31.406
You know what, Holly, if you
want to turn down hot delivery guy

05:31.441 --> 05:33.608
because of some superstition, that's fine.

05:33.610 --> 05:37.446
But this is real money we
can use to pay real bills,

05:37.448 --> 05:39.614
and maybe buy you a new
pair of office supplies.

05:39.665 --> 05:41.533
Oh, okay.

05:41.584 --> 05:44.286
Wait. Let me just clear
this with my psychic.

05:44.337 --> 05:46.755
Oh, that lady with all the parrots? No.

05:48.591 --> 05:50.459
We're taking the case.

05:50.510 --> 05:52.294
Fine!

05:52.345 --> 05:55.464
I just hope someone knows
how to perform exorcisms.

05:55.515 --> 05:57.332
Googling it now!

05:57.366 --> 05:59.684
Found one. Oh my God.

05:59.719 --> 06:03.221
There's a lot of vomit.

06:09.278 --> 06:11.696
Oh good, this isn't spooky at all.

06:12.732 --> 06:14.533
It's just old.

06:14.567 --> 06:15.700
It's not like there's a clown with a knife

06:15.735 --> 06:17.536
waiting under the stairs.

06:18.621 --> 06:20.489
Wait, that was really specific.

06:20.491 --> 06:22.240
Something you wanna share?

06:22.291 --> 06:25.327
Wow, this place is incredible.

06:25.329 --> 06:26.711
Look at these crown moldings

06:26.746 --> 06:29.297
and this detail around the bar.

06:29.332 --> 06:32.417
Oh my God. It's like house porn.

06:32.468 --> 06:34.386
Yep, it's really something.

06:34.420 --> 06:36.638
I've been the caretaker here most my life.

06:36.672 --> 06:40.258
Lots of memories. If
these walls could talk...

06:40.309 --> 06:42.277
Oh, I don't care if they talk.

06:42.311 --> 06:44.346
I just want to know if they bleed.

06:45.598 --> 06:47.682
Sorry, we heard the place was haunted.

06:47.733 --> 06:50.318
Oh, you heard about Hester, huh?

06:57.410 --> 06:58.493
Who's Hester?

06:58.528 --> 07:00.579
Hester and Roger Carlysle

07:00.613 --> 07:02.447
bought this place in 1941.

07:02.498 --> 07:06.301
Then the war called, and
he went missing in action.

07:06.335 --> 07:10.205
Years passed. People urged
Hester to get on with her life,

07:10.256 --> 07:14.376
but she said Roger was her one true love.

07:14.378 --> 07:17.295
So she waited for 60 years

07:17.346 --> 07:19.297
until finally she passed.

07:19.348 --> 07:21.433
Oh, what a lovely story.

07:21.467 --> 07:23.268
We didn't find her for weeks.

07:24.554 --> 07:27.222
By then, the cats had
nibbled out her eyeballs.

07:27.273 --> 07:30.392
I've always been a dog person.

07:30.443 --> 07:32.444
Oh, then the dogs ate the rest of her.

07:36.566 --> 07:39.484
- I see what you mean. Good memories.
- Mm-hmm.

07:39.535 --> 07:43.288
Some say that Hester is still here

07:43.322 --> 07:45.290
waiting for Roger to return,

07:45.324 --> 07:48.410
rocking in her chair,

07:48.412 --> 07:51.646
clutching her gold locket.

07:53.499 --> 07:55.550
Well, toodle-oo.

07:55.585 --> 07:57.552
Uh, did you say gold locket?

07:57.587 --> 07:59.421
Yep. They never found it.

07:59.423 --> 08:00.672
Who knows?

08:00.723 --> 08:03.625
It's probably still here
in the house somewhere.

08:04.644 --> 08:06.344
Toodle-oo again.

08:16.489 --> 08:18.690
Cool, no ghosts. Let's go grab Sushi.

08:18.741 --> 08:20.525
No, no, no, no.

08:20.576 --> 08:22.611
We are staying the night here
like we're paid to do, okay?

08:22.662 --> 08:24.613
And I want to look for that locket.

08:24.615 --> 08:26.364
Fine. Fine.

08:26.415 --> 08:27.582
Yeah, just pretend like

08:27.617 --> 08:28.700
we're on a girls' night out, okay?

08:28.751 --> 08:31.286
Yeah, just you, me,

08:31.337 --> 08:33.255
some old lady ghost... no eyeballs.

08:33.289 --> 08:34.506
Party time.

08:40.429 --> 08:42.347
The rest of the house is clear,

08:42.381 --> 08:44.516
and there are no disturbances on infrared,

08:44.550 --> 08:45.684
which can only mean one thing...

08:45.718 --> 08:48.470
This thing is broken.

08:48.521 --> 08:50.372
Because...

08:50.406 --> 08:52.307
I feel Hester.

08:54.310 --> 08:56.311
You feel those three chili dogs

08:56.313 --> 08:57.562
you had to have on the way up here.

08:57.613 --> 09:00.282
I think I know the difference

09:00.316 --> 09:01.566
between a ghost and a chili dog.

09:01.617 --> 09:04.286
Yes, chili dogs exist.

09:05.454 --> 09:07.205
If I had a buzz-kill detector,

09:07.239 --> 09:09.491
it'd be beeping like crazy right now.

09:09.493 --> 09:10.659
What are you doing?

09:10.710 --> 09:12.377
I'm looking for the locket.

09:12.411 --> 09:14.462
Maybe Hester doesn't want you to find it.

09:14.497 --> 09:16.581
Oh, why? Are you and Hester BFFs now?

09:16.632 --> 09:19.501
Maybe Hester should come on out

09:19.503 --> 09:21.670
and give me a big
smooch-a-roonie on my butt.

09:21.721 --> 09:24.589
She was just kidding about that.

09:24.640 --> 09:27.242
I do feel sorry for her though.

09:27.276 --> 09:30.495
Can you imagine rambling
around this house for 60 years

09:30.529 --> 09:32.447
waiting for your true love to come back?

09:32.449 --> 09:34.366
I wouldn't know.

09:34.417 --> 09:35.583
You're the one with the one true love.

09:35.618 --> 09:37.452
Meeting Michael was your destiny.

09:37.503 --> 09:40.372
No, meeting Michael was a coincidence.

09:40.423 --> 09:43.258
I hired a contractor and he showed up.

09:43.292 --> 09:45.343
See? Destiny.

09:45.378 --> 09:48.463
I think the closest I came
to true love was Clyde.

09:48.465 --> 09:50.265
Ugh, Clyde?!

09:50.299 --> 09:52.267
That loser you were engaged to?

09:52.301 --> 09:54.269
All he did was sit around in your trailer,

09:54.303 --> 09:56.221
smoke pot, and play video games.

09:56.272 --> 09:58.440
Yeah, but still.

09:58.474 --> 10:01.443
Since then, the closest
I came to true love?

10:01.477 --> 10:04.646
Mm, my lime green Louboutins.

10:04.648 --> 10:07.315
Yeah, those were good shoes.

10:07.317 --> 10:08.400
Whatever happened to those?

10:08.451 --> 10:09.567
Still in the closet

10:09.618 --> 10:11.403
with the rest of my ex-boyfriends.

10:12.621 --> 10:14.489
Oh my God.

10:14.540 --> 10:17.375
The temperature, it just
dropped five degrees!

10:17.410 --> 10:19.327
Okay, so maybe there's a draft.

10:19.378 --> 10:21.663
Or maybe Hester's coming
to put her ghost lips

10:21.665 --> 10:23.381
on your butt like you requested.

10:23.416 --> 10:26.334
Oh. Okay, Hester. Here it is.

10:26.369 --> 10:27.502
Pucker it up.

10:29.588 --> 10:31.740
Ah, I just saw something in the hallway!

10:31.774 --> 10:33.725
What?

10:33.759 --> 10:35.510
Still not scared.

10:43.746 --> 10:45.697
Hey, girls!

10:45.731 --> 10:47.615
It's so cold out there.

10:47.650 --> 10:49.567
I had to put my snuggie on in the car.

10:49.618 --> 10:52.237
You almost gave us a heart attack!

10:52.288 --> 10:53.288
What are you doing here, Nick?

10:53.322 --> 10:55.240
Holly left her memory foam pillow

10:55.291 --> 10:56.541
and I didn't want it to forget her.

10:57.743 --> 11:00.328
Okay, fine. I couldn't stand the thought

11:00.330 --> 11:01.496
of you guys having fun without me.

11:01.547 --> 11:04.332
Don't worry, no one's having any fun.

11:05.501 --> 11:07.635
It's not supposed to be fun. It's work.

11:07.670 --> 11:09.504
Well, Nick may be tardy,

11:09.555 --> 11:11.339
but he's bringing the party!

11:11.341 --> 11:12.557
Show of hands, who wants to see me crump?

11:15.594 --> 11:17.679
If crump means leave, then yes.

11:17.681 --> 11:19.264
Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary,

11:19.315 --> 11:20.515
- Bloody Mary?
- Nick, no!

11:20.566 --> 11:23.518
I don't need another dead
broad complicating things.

11:23.569 --> 11:25.603
I'm just asking, who wants a Bloody Mary?

11:25.654 --> 11:28.440
I've got hot, super hot,

11:28.491 --> 11:30.575
and Channing Tatum.

11:30.609 --> 11:33.194
Three Magic Mikes on the rocks.

11:34.330 --> 11:36.197
Good idea. I should have a buzz

11:36.248 --> 11:39.334
in case we accidentally
open a portal to hell.

11:39.368 --> 11:40.702
Why don't you help me
look for the locket, okay?

11:40.704 --> 11:43.671
We could use some money to pay
for all that stuff you rented.

11:45.541 --> 11:47.542
Nick hon, was it snowing when you drove up?

11:47.593 --> 11:50.295
Nick?

11:50.346 --> 11:52.547
Where did Nick go?

11:52.581 --> 11:54.516
Where'd the bar go?

11:54.550 --> 11:55.600
Nick?!

11:55.634 --> 11:57.635
I'm in the wall!

11:57.686 --> 11:59.554
Are you okay?

11:59.588 --> 12:01.356
Is the booze okay?

12:01.390 --> 12:03.191
I knew this would happen.

12:03.225 --> 12:04.442
Oh right. You knew that our assistant

12:04.477 --> 12:06.311
would be swallowed up
by a rotating bookshelf?

12:06.362 --> 12:07.612
Is that what you're telling me?

12:07.646 --> 12:10.365
Guys? I think something
just crawled inside of me.

12:12.234 --> 12:14.235
There must be a lever here somewhere.

12:19.658 --> 12:22.510
I mean, usually I get
the spins after I drink.

12:23.546 --> 12:25.213
Little help.

12:32.555 --> 12:34.472
Did you guys get fondled too?

12:35.591 --> 12:36.674
What is that around your neck?

12:36.725 --> 12:39.227
The locket!

12:39.261 --> 12:40.261
I wasn't wearing a locket.

12:40.312 --> 12:41.479
It's Hester's locket.

12:41.514 --> 12:43.314
It's ours now.

12:43.349 --> 12:45.517
Wait! What if her soul can't
rest till she gets this back?

12:45.568 --> 12:49.404
Oh please, she doesn't care
about this old thing. She's dead.

12:51.657 --> 12:54.275
Apparently, she's still mad
at that chandelier, though.

12:56.662 --> 12:58.279
Oh, Charles,

12:58.314 --> 12:59.614
are you sure you don't want to join?

12:59.665 --> 13:01.182
We're trying to contact Hester.

13:01.217 --> 13:02.450
No, I'm good.

13:03.502 --> 13:05.336
Fine. We'll do it without you.

13:05.371 --> 13:07.372
It's so cool you're a medium.

13:07.423 --> 13:08.623
Bite your tongue.

13:08.625 --> 13:10.341
I'm a boy's small.

13:14.497 --> 13:16.464
- What was that sound?
- What sound?

13:16.466 --> 13:19.350
You know, the sound of
a ghost dragging chains?

13:19.385 --> 13:22.637
I'm sure there's a perfectly
reasonable explanation.

13:22.671 --> 13:25.640
Like maybe those cats
and dogs that ate Hester

13:25.691 --> 13:28.309
are dragging around some chains.

13:30.613 --> 13:32.614
Me again.

13:32.648 --> 13:34.649
Figured you guys could use some snow chains

13:34.651 --> 13:35.650
to get down the mountain.

13:35.652 --> 13:37.485
Great.

13:38.721 --> 13:42.290
E.M.F. monitor! There's
a presence in the room!

13:42.324 --> 13:45.243
Great, now there's a
presence in my underwear.

13:46.362 --> 13:47.662
Gross. Bye.

13:49.548 --> 13:52.417
Okay, Holly, can you do
something about that beeping?

13:52.468 --> 13:56.337
I can't! It's her
energy... It's too strong.

13:56.388 --> 13:58.673
It's probably just the batteries are dying.

13:58.675 --> 14:00.308
That is possible.

14:00.342 --> 14:01.593
I did take it from the smoke detector,

14:01.644 --> 14:03.511
which was beeping at the time.

14:03.513 --> 14:05.480
We need professional advice.

14:05.514 --> 14:08.349
Give me your credit card.
I'm gotta call my psychic.

14:08.351 --> 14:10.351
Okay, good God, woman,

14:10.402 --> 14:12.654
would you take some
responsibility for your life?

14:12.688 --> 14:15.190
What is that supposed to mean?

14:15.241 --> 14:18.326
It means you just let this mumbo jumbo

14:18.360 --> 14:20.245
make all your decisions for you.

14:20.279 --> 14:22.363
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

14:22.414 --> 14:25.500
Uh, remember that time you
passed up the role in "Titanic"

14:25.534 --> 14:27.619
because it started
filming on Friday the 13th?

14:27.670 --> 14:30.505
Okay, to be fair, that was "Titantric"

14:30.539 --> 14:32.257
and it was for Cinemax.

14:33.626 --> 14:37.345
Okay. How about when you broke
off your engagement with Clyde

14:37.379 --> 14:40.381
because your horoscope said you
shouldn't make any big decisions?

14:40.383 --> 14:42.417
Horoscopes don't lie.

14:42.451 --> 14:44.686
Oh really? Because I
made that horoscope up!

14:44.720 --> 14:46.221
How about that?

14:46.223 --> 14:48.356
Escandalo!

14:51.227 --> 14:53.645
Yeah, I had Deano in the
Prop Department do it for me.

14:53.696 --> 14:55.396
The point is

14:55.447 --> 14:58.633
you let all this other
stuff rule your life.

14:58.667 --> 15:02.287
No, the point is you ruined my life.

15:02.321 --> 15:03.621
I didn't ruin your life.

15:03.656 --> 15:06.291
I was protecting you from running off

15:06.325 --> 15:09.160
with some loser you'd known for a week.

15:09.211 --> 15:11.246
That loser was Clyde Douglas.

15:11.297 --> 15:13.214
He founded a video game company

15:13.249 --> 15:15.466
it's worth over a $100 million.

15:15.501 --> 15:18.303
Oh, see, I did not know that.

15:20.556 --> 15:23.424
Holly...

15:23.475 --> 15:25.310
Buzz-kill detector.

15:26.428 --> 15:28.429
Beep...

15:28.431 --> 15:30.265
Beep...

15:30.267 --> 15:32.567
- Beep.
- Okay, stop doing that.

15:32.601 --> 15:34.602
Beep, beep, beep, beep,
beep, beep, beep, beep...

15:39.563 --> 15:41.580
Hey. She still mad at me?

15:41.632 --> 15:43.733
Well, she doesn't want to talk to you,

15:43.767 --> 15:46.585
but she does want to know
if you brought any cookies.

15:47.721 --> 15:50.506
- Really?
- Fine, they're for me.

15:50.508 --> 15:52.475
In my bag.

15:53.510 --> 15:56.395
Man, did I screw up.

15:56.430 --> 15:57.513
I'm reading about this Clyde guy...

15:57.564 --> 15:58.748
He's amazing.

15:58.782 --> 16:00.733
Rich, accomplished, full head of hair.

16:00.767 --> 16:03.352
Don't worry. She'll find
another bazillionaire...

16:04.438 --> 16:06.322
who has an island?

16:07.524 --> 16:09.692
- Yeah, you screwed up.
- Mm-hmm.

16:09.743 --> 16:12.662
I thought I was doing the right thing.

16:12.696 --> 16:15.498
When we started out on "Mystery
Girls," we were so young.

16:15.532 --> 16:17.500
I had solid parents, but Holly didn't.

16:17.534 --> 16:19.585
She was so trusting.

16:19.619 --> 16:22.421
Everybody was always
taking advantage of her.

16:22.456 --> 16:24.457
I get it. You were trying
to being a good friend.

16:24.508 --> 16:26.342
But it's not your job to stop her

16:26.376 --> 16:27.543
from making bad decisions.

16:27.545 --> 16:29.712
It's your job to support her when she does.

16:29.714 --> 16:31.797
Wow. That was really insightful.

16:31.848 --> 16:33.649
I know, right?

16:33.684 --> 16:35.418
Holly said it in episode 87

16:35.452 --> 16:36.802
when you were temporarily
blinded by that bee sting.

16:40.607 --> 16:41.807
Just getting my sleeping bag.

16:41.858 --> 16:43.726
I'll be sleeping upstairs...

16:43.728 --> 16:45.561
safe from the evil spirit

16:45.612 --> 16:47.463
that sits right here on this couch.

16:50.567 --> 16:52.568
Look, Holly, I'm sorry.

16:52.570 --> 16:54.704
Okay, I... I was wrong.

16:54.738 --> 16:56.706
I thought Clyde was a total loser,

16:56.740 --> 17:00.710
but I should've let you come
to that conclusion on your own.

17:00.744 --> 17:02.411
It turns out he's amazing.

17:02.413 --> 17:04.413
Even after his wife died, he was a rock.

17:04.415 --> 17:07.383
- One of his kids is like a cello prodigy...
- Wait, wait, wait.

17:07.416 --> 17:08.751
His wife died?

17:10.670 --> 17:13.756
Yeah, yeah. They were
driving home from some gala

17:13.758 --> 17:15.641
and a truck plowed right into them.

17:15.675 --> 17:17.675
Oh my God.

17:17.728 --> 17:19.512
That would have been me.

17:19.563 --> 17:22.431
Well, we don't know that.

17:22.482 --> 17:24.599
You know how much I love galas!

17:24.651 --> 17:27.603
I would totally be dead right now.

17:27.654 --> 17:30.689
And I'd have to text you on a Ouija board.

17:34.611 --> 17:37.747
When you altered my
destiny, you saved my life.

17:37.781 --> 17:39.582
Ha!

17:39.616 --> 17:40.616
Take that, Hester!

17:40.618 --> 17:43.419
I cheated death when you couldn't!

17:43.453 --> 17:45.421
Oh, wait. I'm just kidding,

17:45.455 --> 17:47.456
don't haunt me, please?

17:47.507 --> 17:48.791
So you forgive me?

17:50.627 --> 17:53.429
Yeah. Of course I do.

17:53.463 --> 17:57.433
By the way, I found this on the doorknob.

17:57.467 --> 18:00.302
I was wearing that 10 minutes ago!

18:04.641 --> 18:07.560
Never had a lesson!

18:12.732 --> 18:16.318
You get me a coffee, Charlie.

18:16.369 --> 18:18.704
- You're fired, Charlie.
- Hey.

18:18.738 --> 18:21.791
Wake up, Sleeping Beauty.
We made it through the night.

18:23.326 --> 18:25.377
Hey, who braided my hair?

18:27.464 --> 18:28.497
Oh, dang. It was me.

18:30.750 --> 18:32.635
- Hi.
- Hey.

18:32.669 --> 18:34.503
Come on in.

18:34.554 --> 18:37.339
Well, how'd it go?

18:37.341 --> 18:40.342
We're happy to report that
there are no ghosts in the house.

18:40.393 --> 18:41.594
Well, there's one ghost,

18:41.645 --> 18:43.429
but we came to a complete understanding

18:43.480 --> 18:44.647
and she's totally cool
with you guys moving in.

18:44.681 --> 18:46.599
Mystery solved.

18:48.735 --> 18:50.519
I'm unclear. Am I paying you or not?

18:50.570 --> 18:52.370
Paying us.

18:52.372 --> 18:54.472
Uh-uh. Not there.

18:54.474 --> 18:55.691
Yeah, I wouldn't.

18:58.445 --> 18:59.695
Uh, glad you got in okay.

18:59.746 --> 19:02.615
I was worried I'd forgotten
to put the key under the mat.

19:02.666 --> 19:04.667
It was no problem. The caretaker let us in.

19:04.701 --> 19:06.285
Caretaker?

19:06.336 --> 19:07.620
Yeah. Walt.

19:11.374 --> 19:13.609
Walt died five years ago.

19:14.794 --> 19:17.580
Oh, wait, Walt! Of course.

19:17.597 --> 19:19.381
I'm thinking of Dave the gardener.

19:19.432 --> 19:21.433
- Dave's dead, Walt's fine.
- Whew.

19:23.553 --> 19:26.355
- Thank you.
- Nice locket.

19:26.389 --> 19:27.606
Oh, yeah.

19:27.641 --> 19:29.558
You said if we found something
we liked, we could keep it.

19:29.593 --> 19:32.561
Absolutely. I hope you enjoy
it, no matter what Walt says.

19:32.612 --> 19:35.564
Uh, wait, wait. What does Walt say?

19:35.615 --> 19:37.566
You know, that it's cursed,

19:37.568 --> 19:39.568
and whoever takes possession of it

19:39.570 --> 19:41.537
is doomed to eternal suffering.

19:41.571 --> 19:42.538
Well, bye.

19:45.408 --> 19:48.327
Well, good thing you don't
believe in that sort of thing.

19:48.378 --> 19:51.330
Yeah, good thing.

19:52.799 --> 19:54.800
You know what?

19:54.834 --> 19:58.587
Hester, it's all yours.

19:58.638 --> 20:00.639
I'm just gonna...

20:00.674 --> 20:03.475
take this vase.

20:03.510 --> 20:05.761
- Is she okay with that?
- Oh, let me check.

20:05.812 --> 20:07.596
Yep, fine.

20:07.598 --> 20:09.765
Let me grab my stuff, guys.

20:14.604 --> 20:17.640
Guys? In the wall again.

20:19.442 --> 20:20.776
I say we leave him.

20:26.719 --> 20:28.587
Morning.

20:28.589 --> 20:30.389
Hi.

20:30.424 --> 20:32.308
Just need you to sign.

20:32.342 --> 20:34.760
You know, there's a new
pair of shoes in there.

20:34.762 --> 20:36.729
How about I wear 'em on a date with you?

20:36.763 --> 20:38.597
All right.

20:38.648 --> 20:40.649
You sure that's gonna be
okay with your psychic?

20:40.684 --> 20:42.401
Hm?

20:42.436 --> 20:44.570
I'm trying to be a little
more proactive with my life,

20:44.604 --> 20:46.355
leave less up to the fates.

20:46.406 --> 20:48.324
I hear that. I'll pick you up at 6:00.

20:48.358 --> 20:49.608
I hope you like food.

20:55.532 --> 20:56.665
Look at you,

20:56.700 --> 20:59.285
making your own decisions.

20:59.336 --> 21:00.669
Our little girl is all grown up.

21:00.704 --> 21:04.290
Yep, no longer listening
to all that mumbo jumbo.

21:04.292 --> 21:05.624
This girl thinks for herself.

21:05.626 --> 21:07.676
Although I did consult
the magic eight ball.

21:07.711 --> 21:10.513
It said to "Ask again
later," I took that for "Yes."

21:11.698 --> 21:13.466
Is there a delivery guy in my future?

21:13.468 --> 21:14.683
"Not likely."

21:14.718 --> 21:16.719
"Not likely." "Not likely"?

21:16.770 --> 21:18.637
"Not likely"?!
