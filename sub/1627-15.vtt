NARRATOR:
Once upon a time, an evil queen

00:04.380 --> 00:08.749
banished every storybook character
you’ve ever known to our world.

00:09.260 --> 00:13.173
Who knows the truth
and who can break the spell?

00:13.347 --> 00:14.507
You don't play with the curse.

00:15.725 --> 00:17.465
I don't understand.
You're not going to kill me?

00:17.560 --> 00:18.891
Run!

00:19.061 --> 00:21.768
But you not only lied to her,
you lied to me.

00:21.898 --> 00:22.933
What are you saying?

00:23.065 --> 00:24.566
That we shouldn't be together.

00:24.734 --> 00:26.850
It's been 24 hours
since Kathryn went missing.

00:26.944 --> 00:27.933
Have you found anything?

00:28.070 --> 00:29.446
EMMA: I need you to come
to the Sheriff's station with me

00:29.572 --> 00:31.028
and tell me everything.

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACH)

00:44.045 --> 00:45.376
Thank you.

00:48.090 --> 00:51.924
I hope Kathryn is somewhere warm.
Not out in the cold.

00:54.096 --> 00:55.256
David.

00:56.224 --> 00:58.931
I think you need to start worrying
about yourself a little bit more here.

00:59.435 --> 01:00.470
Your wife is missing.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.597
You are in love with another woman.

01:02.730 --> 01:05.312
There's this unexplained
phone call...

01:05.816 --> 01:08.023
I know. I know. ljust...

01:09.153 --> 01:11.189
I can't explain why it says that.

01:13.115 --> 01:14.616
I didn't do anything to my wife.

01:15.117 --> 01:17.403
I'm pretty good at spotting a liar,

01:17.495 --> 01:19.076
and honestly,

01:19.163 --> 01:21.449
liars have better material.

01:25.211 --> 01:26.667
Now, go home.

01:29.548 --> 01:31.129
I can go?

01:33.177 --> 01:36.089
We don't even know
if there was a crime yet.

01:36.180 --> 01:38.296
So, get some sleep.

01:39.517 --> 01:40.848
Thank you.

01:42.603 --> 01:45.595
And, David, maybe get a lawyer.

a roof over your head?

02:01.664 --> 02:02.779
You get used to it.

02:02.873 --> 02:04.283
And plus I had the motorcycle,

They have these prayer temples,

that are overrun with lemurs.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.309
-What's a lemur?
-Ruby!

02:29.400 --> 02:31.140
Just give me a sec!

02:31.235 --> 02:32.600
They're little animals.

02:33.029 --> 02:35.486
Yeah. And they have these eyes
that reflect light,

02:35.573 --> 02:38.360

Nothing that concerns you.

trying to get themselves killed

04:15.840 --> 04:17.455
over a few dead sheep.

04:17.550 --> 04:19.415
Wolf took out a dozen last night.

04:19.510 --> 04:21.626
So you called me in here to what?

Can I go with them, please?
I'll be safe in a big group.

Don't be ludicrous.
You're staying inside

04:32.398 --> 04:33.683
and you're keeping that hood on.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.560
You know red repels wolves.

04:35.651 --> 04:36.891
They're not wearing red.

There're only two more nights
left in wolfstime.

the woods with that wastrel, Peter.

He's not a wastrel.

That was humiliating.

Saturday nights.

about Saturday night.

I'd have better reasons.

And when I think
if I'd only doubled back,

11:47.916 --> 11:50.157
maybe I could have
caught it in the act.

11:50.252 --> 11:53.790
Maybe I would have been able
to slay the creature.

11:53.881 --> 11:55.872
You would not.

11:55.966 --> 11:57.831
Widow Lucas.

11:57.926 --> 12:00.633
This creature is more powerful
than you can imagine.

12:00.721 --> 12:01.927
You wouldn't have a chance.

12:02.556 --> 12:06.344
Stay inside, hide your children,
forget your livestock.

12:06.435 --> 12:08.721
You've said all this before.

12:08.812 --> 12:10.313
But I haven't said how I know.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.516
Nearly three score years ago,

12:12.608 --> 12:16.317
l was a child with six older brothers

12:16.403 --> 12:17.392
big as oak trees,

12:17.487 --> 12:19.899
all of them veterans
of the second Ogres-war.

12:19.990 --> 12:22.857
And my father,
the biggest of them all.

12:23.410 --> 12:26.698
Come one wolfstime, he decided
to go out and take on the wolf.

12:26.788 --> 12:30.121
A different wolf back then,
of course, but just as fearsome.

12:31.126 --> 12:33.868
They went out there to protect me.

12:33.962 --> 12:35.463
l was supposed to be asleep,

12:35.547 --> 12:39.711
but I crawled out on the roof to
watch and lay down in the thatch.

12:39.801 --> 12:42.668
They had the beast surrounded,
the seven of them,

12:42.763 --> 12:44.719
with spears all pointed in at it.

12:44.806 --> 12:46.216
And then it started.

12:46.308 --> 12:47.548
It was lunging.

12:47.643 --> 12:49.554
Not at the men, at the spears,

12:50.312 --> 12:53.054
grabbing with its teeth,
breaking the shafts.

12:53.148 --> 12:55.013
They stabbed it with
the splintered end,

12:55.108 --> 12:56.564
but it didn't matter.

12:56.652 --> 12:59.189
lt tore their throats so fast

12:59.279 --> 13:03.272
that not one of them
got a chance to scream, or pray,

13:06.328 --> 13:07.784
or say goodbye.

13:09.498 --> 13:13.582
When my father died,
I tumbled from the roof.

13:13.669 --> 13:17.161
And I landed in the blood
in front of the wolf.

13:17.839 --> 13:20.831
I felt its breath on my face.

13:21.677 --> 13:24.714
And it clamped its hotjaw on my arm

13:25.472 --> 13:27.383
and I rolled away.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.804
(PEOPLE MURMURING)

13:35.649 --> 13:38.641
Then it looked at me with eyes
so black they weren't even there.

13:38.735 --> 13:40.600
And it walked away.

13:40.696 --> 13:42.812
You ever see a wild animal
just turn its back and walk away

13:42.906 --> 13:44.771
like you don't matter?

13:44.866 --> 13:48.529
If this wolf is like that one,
there is no defeating it.

13:49.204 --> 13:51.820
It's already won
just by existing in our world.

13:53.125 --> 13:56.288
You don't kill it. You just hide.

13:58.755 --> 14:01.588
So, your granny is kind of intense.

14:01.675 --> 14:03.506
Yeah. (CHUCKLES) A bit.

14:05.679 --> 14:08.091
lfeel like a rat in a trap.

14:10.267 --> 14:12.383
Is this trap keeping you from

14:13.520 --> 14:15.260
being with someone?

14:16.481 --> 14:17.641
How did you know?

14:17.733 --> 14:19.815
Well, I saw some looks exchanged
back there.

14:19.901 --> 14:21.641
And I hate to break it to you,
but it wasn't subtle.

14:21.737 --> 14:23.352
(GIGGLES)

14:23.613 --> 14:24.989
Yes.

14:26.074 --> 14:28.781

Well, changing.

14:35.542 --> 14:36.702
That must be nice.

14:37.919 --> 14:39.455
Do you have someone?

14:39.546 --> 14:42.788
Oh, no. And I'm not sure
that's in my future.

14:42.883 --> 14:44.339
You're lucky, Red.

14:44.426 --> 14:45.461
I know.

14:47.721 --> 14:49.461
And we're talking about
going away together,

14:50.932 --> 14:54.015
but I don't even get
any time with him.

14:54.102 --> 14:56.684
Granny's too afraid of the wolf
to let me out alone.

14:57.147 --> 14:58.603
You saw what the wolf did.

15:00.025 --> 15:02.232
Sometimes I wonder if she's right.

15:02.319 --> 15:04.059
Oh, she's right about the wolf.

15:04.905 --> 15:07.487
But she's wrong to use it
to keep you from love.

15:08.992 --> 15:10.823
You think that's what she's doing?

15:17.751 --> 15:19.491

But they go at night,
when it's got the advantage.

15:31.640 --> 15:33.505
If we went now, we could find it
slumbering in its den

15:33.600 --> 15:34.840
and kill it in its sleep.

Last night.

22:37.649 --> 22:39.105
Before the killings.

22:39.400 --> 22:41.311
And he neverjoined the guys
to hunt the wolf.

22:41.402 --> 22:42.938

he wouldn't have killed them.

25:22.730 --> 25:23.890

so that I can't get out.

25:38.204 --> 25:39.364
And then you need
to get away from me.

25:39.455 --> 25:40.911

25:43.251 --> 25:44.616

26:07.942 --> 26:10.354
Okay, kid,
I don't mean to kick you out,

26:10.445 --> 26:12.652
but I gotta go see if David's in
some kind of trouble out there.

26:12.739 --> 26:14.650
It's okay.
I'm supposed to meet my mom.

26:16.743 --> 26:18.153
-There.
-Nice.

26:19.662 --> 26:21.869
You know, you can let Ruby do more.

26:21.956 --> 26:23.412
She's Little Red Riding Hood.

26:24.208 --> 26:27.666
With the little basket? (CHUCKLES)
Yeah, she seems like a badass.

26:27.754 --> 26:29.335
She is. She just doesn't remember
how cool she is

26:29.422 --> 26:30.912
or what she's capable of.

26:31.007 --> 26:33.043
-But it's true.
-(SIGHS)

26:34.177 --> 26:35.587

-Hey, Henry.

26:35.678 --> 26:37.418
Got your grilled cheese.

26:37.764 --> 26:39.095
Thank you.

26:42.393 --> 26:44.224
-You all right?
-I guess.

26:44.312 --> 26:48.225
I mean, this is something
I know how to do, so yay.

26:50.693 --> 26:52.274
Okay. Let's pack these back up.

26:52.361 --> 26:54.522
And we can eat it in the car.

26:54.614 --> 26:56.400
I need to do
a little wilderness search,

26:56.491 --> 26:57.947
and I need your help.

26:58.034 --> 26:59.899
I'm pretty sure
I'm just gonna screw it up.

26:59.994 --> 27:02.235
I mean,
I'll screw it up with flair, but...

27:02.330 --> 27:04.616
No, you won't. Come on.

27:04.707 --> 27:05.696
You can do this.

27:07.502 --> 27:10.335
This place is massive.
How are we supposed to find one guy?

27:10.421 --> 27:12.662
Shh. Hey, shh.
We might be able to hear him.

27:12.799 --> 27:14.289
It's massive.

27:14.383 --> 27:16.544
I'm following the path
because there are boot prints

27:16.636 --> 27:17.796
so just stay close.

27:17.887 --> 27:20.924
I shouldn't even be here.
I'm just gonna screw everything up.

27:21.015 --> 27:22.880
-Wait.
-Ruby.

27:23.017 --> 27:24.803
I hear him.

27:24.894 --> 27:26.225
-Really?
-Yeah, really.

27:26.354 --> 27:28.686
I hear him or something,

27:28.815 --> 27:30.771
I mean, I know where he is.
Don't you?

27:30.858 --> 27:31.847
NO.

27:33.236 --> 27:34.316
What are you doing?

27:34.403 --> 27:35.859
-He's over here!
-Ruby.

27:49.919 --> 27:53.207
Oh, God. Come on. David. Come on.
Wake up.

27:53.714 --> 27:55.329

27:55.842 --> 27:56.797
Hey.

27:56.884 --> 27:58.044

27:59.011 --> 28:00.876

28:01.222 --> 28:02.712
Do you remember where you are?

28:02.807 --> 28:04.388
NO, I...

28:05.601 --> 28:07.057
What the hell?

28:07.895 --> 28:10.853
I was in your Office and...

28:12.775 --> 28:14.276
Did you bring me here?

28:14.735 --> 28:17.772
You don't remember anything
since you were in my office?

28:17.864 --> 28:19.320
Last night?

28:20.950 --> 28:21.939
NO.

28:23.744 --> 28:24.779
I don't.

28:33.296 --> 28:36.663
Well, he's bruised, scratched up,
a little dehydrated...

28:36.757 --> 28:37.837
What did you expect?

28:38.217 --> 28:39.423
He's got a cut on his head.

28:39.760 --> 28:41.045
WHALE: It's superficial.

28:41.596 --> 28:43.632
I can refer him to Dr. Hopper
for a mental health eval,

28:44.098 --> 28:46.680
but it's my opinion that whatever
caused this blackout is

28:46.767 --> 28:49.429
the same phenomenon we observed
when he came out of his coma.

28:49.812 --> 28:52.770
Moving around, acting out,
not remembering it later.

28:54.066 --> 28:55.317
We will figure it out.

28:55.735 --> 28:58.818
(SIGHS) It's so strange.
I can't even believe it happened.

28:59.947 --> 29:03.030
How functional could he be
during one of these episodes?

29:03.117 --> 29:05.324
I mean, he talked to someone.

29:05.786 --> 29:08.823
People in similar states,
even under sleep medication,

29:08.915 --> 29:10.451
do all sorts of things.

29:10.541 --> 29:12.918
Cooking, talking, driving a car.

29:13.502 --> 29:16.494
You want to know if
I could've made that call.

29:17.590 --> 29:18.830
Or more.

29:20.635 --> 29:23.377
You want to know if I could've,
what, kidnapped her?

29:25.264 --> 29:26.800
-Killed her?
-Take it easy, there.

29:26.891 --> 29:29.348
No one's saying
you did anything bad, David.

29:29.435 --> 29:32.643
NO, but it would explain
why it didn't seem like I was lying.

29:33.189 --> 29:34.224
I wouldn't know.

29:34.315 --> 29:35.930
Stop talking, David.

29:36.025 --> 29:37.561
What are you doing here?

29:37.652 --> 29:40.519
Why doesn't this man
have a lawyer present?

29:40.613 --> 29:42.069
Have you even read him his rights?

29:42.156 --> 29:44.943
No. Because he's not under arrest.
We're just talking.

29:45.451 --> 29:47.692
Right. Just talking.

29:47.787 --> 29:49.072
What are you doing here?

29:49.163 --> 29:52.530
Mayor Mills is still
Mr. Nolan's emergency contact.

29:52.959 --> 29:54.790
You have to be kidding me.

29:54.877 --> 29:56.617
I thought that changed to Kathryn.

29:56.712 --> 29:58.703
Well, Kathryn is
currently unavailable.

29:59.966 --> 30:02.002
Some people haven't found her yet.

30:02.385 --> 30:05.422
Stop trying to place blame
and just find her.

30:05.513 --> 30:07.674
There's a whole lot of Maine
to search, Regina.

30:07.765 --> 30:10.097
Well, you covered this room.

30:10.184 --> 30:12.300
I suggest you branch out.

went for a dreamwalk,

30:31.205 --> 30:33.196
he went to the toll bridge.
You know the one?

30:33.290 --> 30:34.325
It’s a crazy hunch,

30:34.417 --> 30:36.624
but I want you to take my Bug
and go and see if he was there.

30:36.711 --> 30:38.747
I could get somebody else to.

30:38.838 --> 30:39.998

I don't know.

30:44.510 --> 30:47.468
It's gonna be dark out soon.
David's gonna be let out.

we gotta get there ﬁrst.

37:26.787 --> 37:28.743
-(MEN SHOUTING IN DISTANCE)
-Red, go!

37:29.206 --> 37:30.537
It's me?

37:30.749 --> 37:32.580
(SHOUTING GROWS LOUDER)

37:34.962 --> 37:37.544
(CRYING) Oh, gods, it's me.

37:37.631 --> 37:39.371
Red, go!

37:39.466 --> 37:41.502
I don't want to go like this!

37:41.635 --> 37:43.000
-GRANNY: You have to.
-NO.

37:43.387 --> 37:45.924
-NO, no, no, no.
-It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

37:46.306 --> 37:47.887
-Mary, there's no time.
-I know.

37:47.975 --> 37:50.182
-I'Il get her out of here.
-Go.

37:55.441 --> 37:56.772
(SHOUTING)

37:58.944 --> 38:00.559
(DOOR BELLS JINGLE)

38:03.198 --> 38:04.529
You look good.

38:04.658 --> 38:05.864
Thanks.

38:06.410 --> 38:07.650
You want something for the Sheriff?

38:08.120 --> 38:09.155
NO.

38:10.247 --> 38:11.236
(GROANS)

38:11.331 --> 38:12.366
Your arm Okay?

38:12.458 --> 38:15.165
Same as it is every full moon. Ah!

38:18.297 --> 38:19.707
What are you doing here, Ruby?

38:19.798 --> 38:22.665
Are you here to tell me more about
your fine newjob?

38:24.845 --> 38:26.585
I want to come back.

38:28.849 --> 38:31.261
Why? You were pretty mad.

38:31.977 --> 38:33.513
I wasn't mad.

38:34.438 --> 38:35.598
Looked like mad from here.

38:35.689 --> 38:38.852
Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Here's the thing.
(CHUCKLES)

38:40.027 --> 38:44.270
You were talking about having me do
all this stuff, and Iwasn't sure...

38:45.491 --> 38:48.733
I said that you wanted me
to turn into you.

38:48.827 --> 38:52.194
But what I meant was,

38:52.789 --> 38:54.370
I don't know how to be you.

38:56.627 --> 38:59.118
You're a tough act to follow.

39:01.882 --> 39:02.917
Oh.

39:04.009 --> 39:08.298
And then you wanted me to take on
all this extra responsibility and...

39:09.056 --> 39:11.889
I guess I just got scared.

39:13.936 --> 39:15.722
Don't be. You shouldn't be.

39:16.480 --> 39:20.393
Well, I am. But it's okay.

39:21.985 --> 39:23.816
I can do it anyway.

39:24.738 --> 39:28.731
I sort of found someone in myself
that was more than I expected.

39:30.661 --> 39:33.243
What about adventure?
What about lemurs?

39:33.747 --> 39:37.239
Emma was my lemur. Did that.

39:38.168 --> 39:40.625
Found out I could do that.

39:41.463 --> 39:44.250
And also that I don't want to.

39:45.676 --> 39:49.419
I don't want a job where a good day
means ruining someone's life.

39:49.513 --> 39:52.425
I wanna do something
that makes me happy.

39:53.433 --> 39:54.934
Somewhere I love.

39:56.103 --> 39:58.685
Look, just so you know,

39:59.439 --> 40:01.270
I wanted you to do
the books and everything

40:01.358 --> 40:04.100
so you can take over when I retire.

40:04.778 --> 40:06.609
Own the whole place.

40:09.116 --> 40:10.777
-Own it?
-Sure.

40:11.952 --> 40:15.536
I mean, who else would I give it to
but someone who loves me back?

40:27.884 --> 40:28.919
Proud of you.

40:30.345 --> 40:31.380
What was that?

40:31.471 --> 40:33.211
You heard me.

40:37.769 --> 40:40.101
David, it's going to be okay.

40:40.188 --> 40:42.099
Really? How do you know that?

40:43.108 --> 40:46.145
Because I honestly can't say anything
about my actions anymore.

40:46.236 --> 40:47.521
There has to be an explanation.

40:51.366 --> 40:52.822
You're right.

40:53.577 --> 40:55.442
But the problem is,

40:55.537 --> 40:57.152
I don't think it's a good one.

41:00.292 --> 41:01.407
(DOOR CLOSES)

41:08.675 --> 41:10.757
What is it? Did you find her?

41:11.178 --> 41:13.590
We found a box.

41:15.515 --> 41:18.177
What does that mean?

41:18.685 --> 41:20.596
We think it...

41:20.687 --> 41:22.518
We think that she...

41:23.023 --> 41:24.012
What?

41:26.401 --> 41:28.187
There is a human heart inside it.

41:31.865 --> 41:33.105
Oh, my God.

41:33.909 --> 41:35.115
DAVID: (SOBBING) No.

41:36.620 --> 41:37.860
(CRYING)

41:38.121 --> 41:39.702
We're gonna send it out
for some tests,

41:39.790 --> 41:42.623
but there aren't
any other missing people.

41:45.045 --> 41:46.751
(WHISPERS) Maybe you should go.

41:48.382 --> 41:49.497
There is more.

41:50.509 --> 41:51.498
What?

41:52.803 --> 41:54.759
There were fingerprints
inside the lid of the box.

41:54.888 --> 41:56.469
I ran them through
the records of everyone in town,

41:56.556 --> 41:57.636
and there was a match.

42:04.648 --> 42:05.808
-Arrest me.
-NO!

42:05.899 --> 42:06.979
David...

42:07.067 --> 42:08.807
Arrest me. Emma, do it.

42:08.902 --> 42:10.017
David, the fingerprints
weren't yours.

42:10.737 --> 42:11.726
(WHISPERS) What?

42:13.281 --> 42:15.772
They were Mary Margaret's.
