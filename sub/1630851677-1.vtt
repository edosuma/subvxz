WEBVTT

02:27.408 --> 02:29.279
This better be good, G.

02:29.323 --> 02:31.151
You don't have coffee?

02:31.194 --> 02:32.978
Do you want coffee?

02:33.022 --> 02:36.504
No. I'm going back to bed soon.
What's going on?

02:36.547 --> 02:39.594
I found these in that cabinet.

02:39.637 --> 02:41.596
What's that mean? What cabinet?
- What are you talking about?
- You remember

02:41.639 --> 02:43.206
a while back,
I asked you what Hetty kept

02:43.250 --> 02:44.773
in that locked cabinet
in the archive room

02:44.816 --> 02:46.296
where the old files are?

02:46.340 --> 02:48.037
No.

02:48.080 --> 02:49.952
You made the comment
that they were lined with lead

02:49.995 --> 02:51.910
and you couldn't see in
with your X-ray vision?

02:51.954 --> 02:53.869
Nope. But that's funny.

02:53.912 --> 02:55.784
Tell me you didn't
break into that cabinet.

02:55.827 --> 02:58.743
Well, technically,
I didn't break anything.

02:58.787 --> 03:00.919
Well, that's one way
to end your career.

03:00.963 --> 03:03.226
I shut off the
security cameras.

03:03.270 --> 03:05.315
Oh, this just keeps
getting better.
Look.

03:05.359 --> 03:07.491
You need to take a look at this.

03:07.535 --> 03:10.581
So I can end my career with you?
That's a hard pass.

03:10.625 --> 03:12.148
You just made me
an accessory

03:12.192 --> 03:14.063
by showing me this stuff.
Just put it back. We'll pretend

03:14.106 --> 03:15.760
it was all a bad dream,
- all right?
- Hold on.

03:15.804 --> 03:17.327
Not until you look at this.

03:17.371 --> 03:19.199
I'm not going
anywhere near that stuff.

03:19.242 --> 03:20.852
Seriously, you should try
sleeping at night.

03:20.896 --> 03:22.985
You know, after 48 hours,

03:23.028 --> 03:24.769
you start hallucinating.
After 96,

03:24.813 --> 03:26.771
you're talking
- sleep deprivation psychosis.
- Okay,

03:26.815 --> 03:28.556
well, I'm not hallucinating,
and I'm not psychotic.

03:28.599 --> 03:29.992
These are files
on foster children

03:30.035 --> 03:33.082
going back decades, some
as young as the age of six.

03:33.125 --> 03:35.127
So?

03:36.172 --> 03:38.087
So, you don't find that strange?

03:38.130 --> 03:40.350
Stranger than you waking me up
in the middle of the night

03:40.394 --> 03:41.525
to inform me that you

03:41.569 --> 03:43.397
violated God knows how many rules,

03:43.440 --> 03:44.920
not to mention codes of conduct?

03:44.963 --> 03:47.183
Subject 17.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.185
Male. Caucasian.

03:49.229 --> 03:52.449
Date of birth, August 8, 1976.

03:54.843 --> 03:56.323
That's my birthday.

03:58.194 --> 04:00.718
These kids were put through
all sorts of cognitive tests.

04:00.762 --> 04:02.416
We call that school.

04:02.459 --> 04:04.244
This wasn't school.

04:04.287 --> 04:06.855
They were
psychologically profiling

04:06.898 --> 04:08.465
and screening these kids.

04:10.685 --> 04:12.643
For what?

04:12.687 --> 04:14.471
I don't know exactly.

04:14.515 --> 04:16.168
But it reads
like a junior version

04:16.212 --> 04:17.474
of the same sort
of selection process

04:17.518 --> 04:19.215
they put me through at the CIA.

04:25.526 --> 04:26.744
Oh.

04:26.788 --> 04:29.443
There you are, Hetty.

04:31.140 --> 04:32.446
Agent Blye.

04:32.489 --> 04:33.838
You going somewhere?

04:33.882 --> 04:36.885
Well,
a short business trip.

04:36.928 --> 04:39.104
What kind of a
short business trip

04:39.148 --> 04:42.064
requires a suitcase
full of secret weapons?

04:42.107 --> 04:43.979
Sorry. I don't want

04:44.022 --> 04:46.547
to interrupt your packing
or anything, which...

04:46.590 --> 04:48.070
clearly, I've already done.

04:48.113 --> 04:49.941
Uh...

04:49.985 --> 04:51.900
Can I ask you for something

04:51.943 --> 04:54.337
- kind of personal?
- Always.

04:54.381 --> 04:55.947
Okay.

04:55.991 --> 04:59.864
Uh, as you may or may not know,

04:59.908 --> 05:02.824
Deeks and I have been trying
to get pregnant.

05:02.867 --> 05:04.956
Like, really trying.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.437
I mean,
we've been to fertility doctors

05:07.481 --> 05:10.048
and alternative medicine,
and, hell, we've even resorted

05:10.092 --> 05:11.876
to a Magic 8 Ball.

05:11.920 --> 05:14.270
Um... It's just

05:14.314 --> 05:17.360
come to that time where
now we're considering adoption,

05:17.404 --> 05:20.145
and I-- we.
We were wondering

05:20.189 --> 05:24.280
if we could use you
as a person of reference.

05:25.934 --> 05:29.720
Oh. Um, no.

05:30.721 --> 05:32.027
Oh.

05:32.070 --> 05:33.202
Oh, no, no, no.

05:33.245 --> 05:34.725
I'm, um,

05:34.769 --> 05:36.640
I'm honored.

05:36.684 --> 05:38.947
Truly, I am.

05:38.990 --> 05:43.212
But I'm not, uh,
the right person for that.

05:43.255 --> 05:44.605
What do you mean?
I mean, you're...

05:44.648 --> 05:45.736
You're one
of the most respected people

05:45.780 --> 05:47.608
in the intelligence community.

05:47.651 --> 05:51.046
Yes, which is vastly different
from the parenting community.

05:51.089 --> 05:53.614
Besides, a reference

05:53.657 --> 05:57.139
from the director or SECNAV

05:57.182 --> 06:00.011
would be
vastly more impressive,

06:00.055 --> 06:01.230
and I think

06:01.273 --> 06:03.363
I could make that happen
for you.

06:04.799 --> 06:07.279
That... Wow.

06:07.323 --> 06:09.760
That would be
great. Thank you.

06:10.761 --> 06:13.416
I'll let you get back
to your packing. I...

06:13.460 --> 06:15.331
Thank you again.

06:24.253 --> 06:26.211
You never read anything so slow
in your life.

06:26.255 --> 06:29.780
You know how sometimes
it's really hard for you to tell

06:29.824 --> 06:31.652
you're starting to annoy me?

06:31.695 --> 06:33.741
This is one of those times.

06:42.706 --> 06:44.708
Remember the Russian dolphin case?

06:44.752 --> 06:47.363
As opposed to all
our other dolphin cases? I mean,

06:47.407 --> 06:49.931
that Norwegian dolphin case
- was a doozy.
- I sent you

06:49.974 --> 06:52.020
and Rountree to the Marine
Institute. Do you know why?

06:52.063 --> 06:55.458
You have an unnatural aversion
- to sea life?
- It was because

06:55.502 --> 06:57.155
of something
Kilbride said to me.

06:57.199 --> 06:59.070
"Stay away
from the sea urchins."

06:59.114 --> 07:00.463
I'm being serious.

07:00.507 --> 07:02.117
You're being weird.

07:02.160 --> 07:04.424
He said that I had
a biased opinion towards Hetty

07:04.467 --> 07:05.990
because she hired you,

07:06.034 --> 07:07.644
but she created me.

07:07.688 --> 07:09.254
He said

07:09.298 --> 07:10.821
"created."

07:10.865 --> 07:13.389
You don't think
that's an odd choice of words?

07:14.390 --> 07:16.131
You've known her
since you were a teenager.

07:16.174 --> 07:17.698
He was probably referencing

07:17.741 --> 07:19.917
her influence
- on your life choices.
- Well,

07:19.961 --> 07:21.353
according to this file,
I may have known her

07:21.397 --> 07:22.529
since I was, like, eight.

07:22.572 --> 07:24.269
You remember her as a kid?

07:24.313 --> 07:25.923
No.

07:26.924 --> 07:29.100
Then this is probably not you.

07:29.144 --> 07:31.015
It's a bunch of
underprivileged kids

07:31.059 --> 07:32.364
who were given an opportunity

07:32.408 --> 07:34.497
to live life
to their full potential.

07:34.541 --> 07:35.977
Please.
Nobody helps the underprivileged

07:36.020 --> 07:37.457
unless they have
an ulterior motive.

07:39.154 --> 07:41.417
G, look.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.724
I know conspiracy theories

07:43.767 --> 07:45.247
have replaced common sense

07:45.290 --> 07:46.901
with a large portion
of the population,

07:46.944 --> 07:47.858
but you're smarter
- than that.
- This is not...

07:47.902 --> 07:49.425
Let me finish.

07:52.733 --> 07:56.258
You've had
a rough couple of years.

07:56.301 --> 07:58.956
More than anyone could
or should have to handle.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.394
Your father. Your sister.
Your nephew.

08:02.438 --> 08:05.049
Joelle. Anna.

08:05.093 --> 08:06.529
Not to mention
the COVID year we just had.

08:08.575 --> 08:11.839
You need to get away
from all of this.

08:11.882 --> 08:14.058
You need to go someplace quiet.
You need to unplug

08:14.102 --> 08:15.451
and detox from all of it.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.235
Trust me.

08:17.279 --> 08:20.674
You made me do the same thing
after Michelle was killed.

08:20.717 --> 08:22.502
Now it's your turn.

08:27.637 --> 08:30.161
Deep down, you know I'm right.

08:30.205 --> 08:32.337
Probably. But...

08:32.381 --> 08:33.861
I mean, come on.

08:33.904 --> 08:35.906
You got to admit
this is sketchy.

08:35.950 --> 08:39.388
I don't know what "this" is.

08:39.431 --> 08:41.825
It's probably best
we both don't.

08:41.869 --> 08:44.654
Yeah, because you're
not Subject 17.

08:46.613 --> 08:47.918
Look, fine. I...

08:47.962 --> 08:49.659
Maybe I am obsessed, okay?

08:49.703 --> 08:51.879
Maybe I'm messed-up.
But my whole life,

08:51.922 --> 08:54.098
I have been searching
to figure out who I am.

08:54.142 --> 08:57.580
And just when I thought I knew,
- this comes up.
- Mm.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.975
Remember Pandora's box?

09:01.976 --> 09:03.673
Want my advice?

09:03.717 --> 09:06.110
Walk away from this.

09:06.154 --> 09:08.112
Go on with your
life as it is now.

09:08.156 --> 09:10.985
It's good. Enjoy that.

09:11.028 --> 09:12.900
Because if you go
down this rabbit hole, G,

09:12.943 --> 09:14.597
you might not like
what you find.

09:14.641 --> 09:17.078
You might even get lost.

09:18.732 --> 09:20.951
You know the CIA's motto?

09:20.995 --> 09:23.345
"The Work of a Nation.
Center for Intelligence."

09:23.388 --> 09:25.173
- That's the official motto.
- Yeah.

09:25.216 --> 09:26.653
The unofficial motto.

09:26.696 --> 09:28.785
John 8:32.

09:30.787 --> 09:32.876
"Ye shall know the truth,

09:32.920 --> 09:36.445
and the truth
shall set you free."

09:36.488 --> 09:37.533
That's all I've ever wanted,
Sam.

09:38.839 --> 09:40.667
We all deserve
to know the truth.

09:51.939 --> 09:53.767
What are you
guys doing here?

09:53.810 --> 09:55.943
- Working on something.
- Oh.

09:55.986 --> 09:58.293
- Everything's still off.
- What are you doing here?

09:58.336 --> 09:59.947
I came to see if
there was a tripped breaker

09:59.990 --> 10:02.950
or something. But we got a case.

10:02.993 --> 10:04.647
What's the case?

10:04.691 --> 10:06.649
A passerby
shot this cell phone video

10:06.693 --> 10:08.956
of two women
having an altercation outside

10:08.999 --> 10:10.697
of a Trader Joe's
in Marina del Rey.

10:10.740 --> 10:13.003
This is what happens when they
run out of Mandarin chicken.

10:13.047 --> 10:15.615
No, I'm serious.
I had a woman hit me

10:15.658 --> 10:17.007
with a bottle of
Two Buck Chuck once

10:17.051 --> 10:18.792
'cause I reached
for the last bag.

10:18.835 --> 10:22.230
When did soccer moms
get so vicious?

10:23.187 --> 10:24.667
Why are we watching this,
Fatima?

10:24.711 --> 10:29.237
Wait for it.

10:29.280 --> 10:30.325
Oh.

10:30.368 --> 10:31.543
That's that Russian SVR agent.

10:31.587 --> 10:33.415
Zasha Gagarin.

10:33.458 --> 10:34.938
Looks like Russia
recalled your asset.

10:34.982 --> 10:36.244
I wouldn't say

10:36.287 --> 10:37.637
she's that lucky.

10:38.855 --> 10:40.248
And that's the woman

10:40.291 --> 10:42.250
who was kidnapped
with the bomb vest.

10:42.293 --> 10:43.904
Joelle Taylor.

10:43.947 --> 10:46.080
Kensi and Deeks
are on their way to the scene.

10:46.123 --> 10:47.342
They won't find anything.

10:47.385 --> 10:48.865
Joelle would have seen to that.
Only thing

10:48.909 --> 10:50.911
she can't control is
an eyewitness with a cell phone.

10:50.954 --> 10:52.434
That's pretty brave,
trying to pull this off

10:52.477 --> 10:54.610
- in broad daylight.
- She's desperate.

10:54.654 --> 10:55.916
For what?

10:56.917 --> 10:58.658
Revenge.

10:59.659 --> 11:00.921
<i>You will never believe</i>

11:00.964 --> 11:03.271
what just came
across my desk.

11:03.314 --> 11:05.621
Well, if it was
a large cockroach

11:05.665 --> 11:08.276
with only one antenna,

11:08.319 --> 11:09.712
his name is Sheldon,

11:09.756 --> 11:13.760
and he's become
sort of an office mascot.

11:13.803 --> 11:14.978
Oh.

11:15.022 --> 11:17.502
I put him through my shredder
last week.

11:17.546 --> 11:19.374
Well, nobody told me
he had a name.

11:19.417 --> 11:20.636
No, these were

11:20.680 --> 11:22.246
travel orders.

11:22.290 --> 11:23.639
You think you're
going back?

11:23.683 --> 11:25.728
- Well, I think I have to.
- Well,

11:25.772 --> 11:27.034
I think somebody has to,

11:27.077 --> 11:28.252
but I'm not so sure
it should be you.

11:28.296 --> 11:29.601
You made a bloody mess of things

11:29.645 --> 11:31.865
- over there the last time.
- Hmm.

11:31.908 --> 11:33.997
Now, I will sign the order,

11:34.041 --> 11:36.913
but if you make it worse,
you will be sacrificed

11:36.957 --> 11:38.785
for the sake of diplomacy,
and if you do

11:38.828 --> 11:40.743
something really stupid
and find yourself

11:40.787 --> 11:43.137
in a cage <i>again,</i>

11:43.180 --> 11:45.705
you will be disavowed.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.839
Well, that's-that's really...

11:49.883 --> 11:52.929
terribly encouraging.

11:54.888 --> 11:57.194
<i>We don't really expect
to find anything</i>

11:57.238 --> 11:59.762
- here, do we?
- Well, if we find
Zasha's car,

11:59.806 --> 12:01.068
we know where Zasha's been.

12:01.111 --> 12:02.765
And Joelle
must have been watching her,

12:02.809 --> 12:05.289
so that means we find out
where Joelle's been, as well.

12:05.333 --> 12:06.987
So if we find where
Joelle's been, then...

12:07.030 --> 12:08.553
Then we have enough clues to
figure out where she is now

12:08.597 --> 12:11.208
- and where she took Zasha.
- They grow up so fast.

12:11.252 --> 12:13.776
It's a fantastic theory,
Sherlie-locks,

12:13.820 --> 12:15.778
except for the fact that Joelle
is a high-level operator,

12:15.822 --> 12:17.737
which means she's probably
already had Zasha's car towed

12:17.780 --> 12:19.782
as her own, right?
Stashed or ditched someplace.

12:19.826 --> 12:21.523
Along with the van
that she was driving.

12:21.566 --> 12:22.916
And even if we find
said vehicles,

12:22.959 --> 12:24.613
both of them will be
wiped down or contaminated

12:24.656 --> 12:27.007
to the point where they're
forensically useless.

12:27.050 --> 12:29.531
Right. Sunshine
and gunpowder,

12:29.574 --> 12:32.229
meet storm cloud
and quicksand.

12:32.273 --> 12:35.015
Oh, I like that.
Quicksand's cool.

12:35.058 --> 12:37.757
Quicksand is...? Right,
until it sucks you under.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.236
What are you talking about?
That's the part

12:39.280 --> 12:40.629
that makes it cool.
Otherwise, it's just a beach.

12:40.672 --> 12:42.413
Oh, my gosh. Hey,
Fatima. What's up?

12:42.457 --> 12:44.067
Wait for it. Wait for it.

12:44.111 --> 12:45.677
- Really?
- Yep.

12:45.721 --> 12:49.464
Okay. Thanks.

12:49.507 --> 12:51.553
So, security cam
footage shows

12:51.596 --> 12:53.468
that Zasha's car was towed.

12:53.511 --> 12:55.818
Boom! Quicksand
for the win.

12:55.862 --> 12:58.125
All right. Let's go, Sandy.

12:58.168 --> 13:00.257
What's going on?
Why are you so sad?

13:00.301 --> 13:02.390
You really didn't expect
to find anything here, did you?

13:02.433 --> 13:03.826
No, that's not it at all.

13:03.870 --> 13:06.089
Though that would have been
helpful. It's, uh...

13:06.133 --> 13:08.396
My conversation with Hetty today

13:08.439 --> 13:10.702
just really threw me off
when she refused

13:10.746 --> 13:12.313
to be a person of reference
for us.

13:12.356 --> 13:14.445
Well, hold on a second.
I don't think she refused that.

13:14.489 --> 13:16.883
I think that she was just
offering up a better suggestion.

13:16.926 --> 13:18.449
SECNAV?

13:18.493 --> 13:20.843
Yeah, that's not
- gonna happen.
- It might not,

13:20.887 --> 13:22.366
but the director could
and probably will.

13:22.410 --> 13:24.804
I mean, I think Hetty's
just trying to be helpful.

13:24.847 --> 13:27.458
No, I just don't think
that's what it was.

13:27.502 --> 13:30.070
She would do anything
- for us, right?
- Right.

13:30.113 --> 13:31.636
I think she genuinely believed

13:31.680 --> 13:33.551
she'd be detrimental to
our adoption process.

13:33.595 --> 13:34.726
Why? What is that about?

13:34.770 --> 13:36.163
Well, she did go through

13:36.206 --> 13:37.860
that awkward
adolescent cannibal phase.

13:37.904 --> 13:39.470
Come on, sweetie.
I'm being serious.

13:39.514 --> 13:43.344
What is more serious
than people eating other people?

13:44.998 --> 13:47.652
It's one
- of the seven deadly sins.
- No. It is not.

13:47.696 --> 13:50.438
- Cannibalism is not a deadly sin?
- Why do I bother?

13:50.481 --> 13:53.093
What about when you-you turn
without using your turn signal?

13:53.136 --> 13:54.790
Or you cut people off
on the freeway?

13:54.834 --> 13:57.010
That's got to be
a deadly sin. Hey, Siri?

13:57.053 --> 13:58.838
Tell me
the seven deadly sins.

13:58.881 --> 14:01.579
- I can't with you.
- All seven of them!

14:02.580 --> 14:04.582
<i>You think Joelle
would hurt Zasha?</i>

14:04.626 --> 14:07.498
I think Joelle would do anything
to get to Katya.

14:07.542 --> 14:08.978
She lost

14:09.022 --> 14:11.198
her family and her leg
because of her.

14:11.241 --> 14:12.982
Neither of which have
anything to do with Zasha.

14:13.026 --> 14:14.984
Joelle knows that, but I think
she's probably hoping

14:15.028 --> 14:17.421
she can force Zasha
to use her SVR connections

14:17.465 --> 14:19.902
- to locate Katya.
- And if she can't?

14:19.946 --> 14:22.905
Then again, Zasha may
know how to find her.

14:22.949 --> 14:25.429
Katya's own country wants
her out of the picture

14:25.473 --> 14:27.910
before she creates even more
problems for the Kremlin.

14:27.954 --> 14:30.565
They must be
actively hunting her.

14:30.608 --> 14:32.393
This could actually be
a good thing, though.

14:32.436 --> 14:33.568
No one's gonna be upset

14:33.611 --> 14:36.092
if Joelle takes out Katya.

14:36.136 --> 14:38.529
No longer be a threat
for you and Anna.

14:42.142 --> 14:44.492
You still with me
on this one?

14:44.535 --> 14:47.843
Katya went to the same sort
of spy school as Anna.

14:47.887 --> 14:52.108
Yeah, the royal princess place
that Arkady told us about.

14:52.152 --> 14:53.936
The Institute of Noble Maidens.

14:53.980 --> 14:56.112
He said they trained
those little girls since

14:56.156 --> 14:57.853
they were children so that by
the time they were in their 20s,

14:57.897 --> 14:59.550
they had almost ten years
of trade craft.

14:59.594 --> 15:01.509
Yeah, nothing's changed.
They-they do the same thing

15:01.552 --> 15:04.294
with athletes, uh,
- musicians, ballerinas.
- Yeah,

15:04.338 --> 15:07.645
but he said that I should
know this more than anyone.

15:07.689 --> 15:09.125
And I-I thought
he just meant

15:09.169 --> 15:11.127
because Anna had told me
about her past,

15:11.171 --> 15:13.651
but he meant because of Hetty.

15:15.740 --> 15:19.005
He said Hetty did the same thing
with her orphans.

15:19.048 --> 15:21.921
You heard him say that, right?

15:21.964 --> 15:23.748
Right?

15:23.792 --> 15:26.795
I just thought he was,
you know, being Arkady.

15:26.838 --> 15:29.145
Plus, you told him
Hetty never trained you.

15:29.189 --> 15:31.408
She just helped you out
when you were a teenager, right?

15:31.452 --> 15:33.323
I don't know. I...

15:33.367 --> 15:35.673
Reading these files triggered
something I'd forgotten

15:35.717 --> 15:36.936
from when I was really young.

15:41.331 --> 15:43.159
Tests I had taken. I...

15:43.203 --> 15:45.814
They told me I had dyslexia,

15:45.857 --> 15:48.817
and I had to do
these remedial exercises.

15:54.344 --> 15:55.955
But the more I think about it...

15:56.999 --> 15:59.132
...the more I remember.

16:18.064 --> 16:19.326
Okay, thanks.

16:19.369 --> 16:20.849
So,

16:20.892 --> 16:22.894
no luck on the towing
company, which is weird.

16:22.938 --> 16:24.287
It could have been bogus.

16:24.331 --> 16:26.159
I mean, Joelle would have
provided it herself.

16:26.202 --> 16:27.725
She'd still need
somebody to operate it.

16:27.769 --> 16:29.379
Somebody she could trust.

16:29.423 --> 16:32.339
I'm gonna have Fatima run down
any past known accomplices.

16:32.382 --> 16:33.862
Where's Hetty?

16:33.905 --> 16:35.472
Uh, last time I saw her,
she was in the armory

16:35.516 --> 16:36.996
- packing.
- Packing?

16:37.039 --> 16:38.606
Yeah, said she had

16:38.649 --> 16:41.043
a business trip. If you ask me,
it was more of a "dark"

16:41.087 --> 16:43.089
bus...

16:43.132 --> 16:44.438
Everything okay?

16:44.481 --> 16:45.874
With me? Yes.

16:45.917 --> 16:47.528
Him, I don't know.

16:47.571 --> 16:48.703
Why? What's going on?

16:48.746 --> 16:50.357
If I had to take a guess,

16:50.400 --> 16:52.750
Hetty hasn't told him everything
she knows about his past,

16:52.794 --> 16:55.884
and some of it could be
a little disturbing.

17:15.251 --> 17:18.211
What, are you planning a coup
I should know about?

17:18.254 --> 17:20.213
Variety is the spice of life,

17:20.256 --> 17:22.563
- Agent Callen.
- Uh-huh. Where's Hetty?

17:22.606 --> 17:23.999
No idea.

17:29.918 --> 17:31.876
You know what these are?

17:31.920 --> 17:34.836
Who am I, Carnac
the Magnificent?

17:34.879 --> 17:36.881
They're files
on kids that were given

17:36.925 --> 17:38.405
a bunch of tests
that sound a hell of a lot

17:38.448 --> 17:40.972
like intelligence
screening programs.

17:41.016 --> 17:43.584
Nobody likes a dumb kid.

17:44.585 --> 17:47.979
You once told me that, uh,
Hetty had created me.

17:49.590 --> 17:50.982
Is this
what you were talking about?

17:51.026 --> 17:53.115
- Where did you get those?
- That's not important.

17:53.159 --> 17:55.030
Many would beg to differ.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.553
Did Hetty run a program

17:56.597 --> 17:59.382
that recruited children
as future operatives?

17:59.426 --> 18:02.777
Now, that definitely sounds
like a question for your mentor.

18:02.820 --> 18:04.605
Answer the question.

18:05.823 --> 18:08.304
Did you hit your head
or something?

18:08.348 --> 18:10.741
You don't give
orders, Agent Callen.

18:10.785 --> 18:13.483
You follow them. And
if you speak to me

18:13.527 --> 18:15.181
in that imperative again,

18:15.224 --> 18:17.618
it will be the last thing
you utter in this building

18:17.661 --> 18:20.011
and, quite possibly,
on this planet!

18:21.970 --> 18:23.145
Where's Hetty going?

18:23.189 --> 18:25.365
Afraid you'll have
to ask her that, too.

18:25.408 --> 18:27.280
Because you don't know
or you won't tell me?

18:27.323 --> 18:29.151
Because it's classified.

18:29.195 --> 18:31.066
- Uh-huh.
- Now, if she wants

18:31.110 --> 18:32.720
to inform you, that's up to her.

18:32.763 --> 18:35.462
My guess is she won't
for any number of reasons,

18:35.505 --> 18:36.985
none of them very good.

18:37.028 --> 18:38.726
But you do know
where she's going.

18:39.727 --> 18:43.296
Probably a very dark
hole in a foreign prison

18:43.339 --> 18:46.777
unless some despot
decides to keep her as a pet.

18:47.735 --> 18:50.346
Your, uh, ex,
Joelle Taylor,

18:50.390 --> 18:53.436
might just find herself in
the same kind of trouble.

18:53.480 --> 18:55.090
Why is that?

18:55.134 --> 18:59.007
Well, there is that business
of assaulting and kidnapping

18:59.050 --> 19:01.183
a foreign national
in broad daylight.

19:01.227 --> 19:04.099
The Russians are already
raging about that.

19:04.143 --> 19:07.755
So, in addition to
her former agency,

19:07.798 --> 19:10.497
she also has the
Russians hunting for her

19:10.540 --> 19:12.890
as well as any freelancers

19:12.934 --> 19:15.415
that they might be
employing over here.

19:15.458 --> 19:18.026
She better hope that our people
get to her first.

19:18.069 --> 19:19.636
- They won't.
- And you know this because?

19:19.680 --> 19:21.072
I know Joelle.

19:21.116 --> 19:22.770
There's no way
she would grab Zasha

19:22.813 --> 19:25.033
in broad daylight
unless she had an airtight plan.

19:25.076 --> 19:26.643
She probably wanted
to be seen doing it.

19:26.687 --> 19:27.601
Why?

19:27.644 --> 19:28.776
I think it's Joelle's way

19:28.819 --> 19:31.213
of telling Katya
that she's coming for her.

19:31.257 --> 19:33.607
So, then,
Zasha is in no real danger?

19:33.650 --> 19:35.739
Mm. I didn't say that.

19:35.783 --> 19:37.611
If Joelle thinks
that Zasha has information

19:37.654 --> 19:39.482
that could help her
locate Katya,

19:39.526 --> 19:42.181
she will do whatever it takes
to get it out of her.

19:45.227 --> 19:49.231
Is there some Women-Who-Kill
dating site out there

19:49.275 --> 19:51.146
that I don't know about,

19:51.190 --> 19:53.670
or do you just have the world's
worst luck with the ladies?

19:55.716 --> 19:59.589
All right. If we can't find
her, then what's our plan?

20:00.721 --> 20:02.244
We're gonna make her come to us.

20:02.288 --> 20:04.812
And how are we gonna do that?

20:05.813 --> 20:07.684
Can you post something
on someone else's

20:07.728 --> 20:09.251
- social media account?
- By "post,"

20:09.295 --> 20:10.557
you mean hack
into their social media account

20:10.600 --> 20:11.906
and make it look
like they posted it?

20:11.949 --> 20:14.125
- Exactly.
- Technically,
yeah, I think so.

20:14.169 --> 20:16.302
Legally and ethically...

20:16.345 --> 20:18.913
I need to get a message
to Joelle.

20:18.956 --> 20:20.219
Her family thinks
she's dead, but I know

20:20.262 --> 20:21.872
she keeps track of them
on social media.

20:21.916 --> 20:23.265
Hell, for all I
know, she's probably

20:23.309 --> 20:26.268
already hacked
- into their accounts herself.
- Mm.

20:26.312 --> 20:28.836
What do you want to say?

20:28.879 --> 20:30.446
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

20:30.490 --> 20:32.013
You're gonna stay
with me here.

20:32.056 --> 20:35.495
You go to sleep,
I promise you won't wake up.

20:35.538 --> 20:37.540
I don't know where Katya is.

20:37.584 --> 20:40.369
Last we heard, she
was back in Russia.

20:40.413 --> 20:41.936
If I knew where she was,

20:41.979 --> 20:43.677
we would have grabbed her
by now.

20:43.720 --> 20:44.895
Yeah, I'm not buying that.

20:50.727 --> 20:53.295
I need Zasha
brought to the boatshed.

20:53.339 --> 20:55.689
You have one hour, or I'm going
to speak with your family.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.524
Aah.

21:04.567 --> 21:06.352
Huh.

21:06.395 --> 21:09.311
I can only imagine what kind
of evidence you're destroying.

21:09.355 --> 21:10.965
Here.

21:11.008 --> 21:12.532
You might want to
add this to it.

21:12.575 --> 21:14.142
It's okay. I made a copy.

21:15.839 --> 21:18.233
Do you care to explain?

21:18.277 --> 21:20.017
Do you?

21:21.671 --> 21:23.978
Am I Subject 17?

21:24.021 --> 21:26.894
Oh, you shouldn't
have done this.

21:26.937 --> 21:28.896
<i>I</i> shouldn't have done this?

21:28.939 --> 21:31.855
You shouldn't
have done any of this.

21:32.856 --> 21:33.857
Am I

21:33.901 --> 21:35.424
Subject 17?

21:35.468 --> 21:37.034
Tell me the truth.

21:37.078 --> 21:39.602
The truth is...

21:39.646 --> 21:42.388
- The truth is a fickle thing.
- Answer

21:42.431 --> 21:43.911
the question, Hetty.

21:45.173 --> 21:48.176
Ask me no questions,

21:48.219 --> 21:50.265
- and I'll tell you no lies.
- Stop it.

21:50.309 --> 21:53.050
Just stop it. Answer me.

21:53.094 --> 21:55.052
I don't answer to you,
Mr. Callen.

21:55.096 --> 21:57.490
Am I Subject 17? Yes or no?

21:57.533 --> 21:59.579
This conversation is over.
The one

21:59.622 --> 22:00.797
about how you got
that file...

22:00.841 --> 22:02.321
Am I Subject 17?!

22:02.364 --> 22:04.801
Do not use that tone with me.

22:04.845 --> 22:06.412
Am I Subject 17?!

22:06.455 --> 22:07.717
Yes!

22:14.115 --> 22:16.073
Yes.

22:25.126 --> 22:26.475
Sorry to interrupt.

22:26.519 --> 22:27.911
Joelle got your message.
She's headed

22:27.955 --> 22:29.783
to the boatshed.

22:29.826 --> 22:32.263
I'll be there in a second.

22:38.922 --> 22:40.968
This is far from over.

23:01.684 --> 23:04.687
Hmm. Cut that close.

23:04.731 --> 23:06.080
Where's the rest of
your misfit friends?

23:06.123 --> 23:07.690
It's just us.

23:07.734 --> 23:09.388
- Where's Zasha?
- She's safe.

23:11.215 --> 23:14.567
I told you... I don't give a damn
what you told me.

23:14.610 --> 23:16.003
I don't work for you.

23:16.046 --> 23:17.134
Well, you don't work
for anybody at the moment.

23:17.178 --> 23:18.962
That's right.

23:19.006 --> 23:21.530
You know what they say.
This time, it's personal.

23:21.574 --> 23:22.966
And that's
when you make mistakes.

23:23.010 --> 23:24.228
You let the emotions in,

23:24.272 --> 23:25.534
and you're done.

23:25.578 --> 23:27.493
What do you want?

23:27.536 --> 23:29.408
I want you to let Zasha go

23:29.451 --> 23:31.497
before this whole thing
- gets out of hand.
- Gets out of hand?

23:31.540 --> 23:33.324
One of her colleagues
tried to kill me,

23:33.368 --> 23:34.761
and it cost me my leg.

23:34.804 --> 23:36.284
None of which had anything to do
with Zasha.

23:36.327 --> 23:37.285
You don't know that.

23:37.328 --> 23:38.329
Not with any certainty.

23:38.373 --> 23:39.809
Yes, I do.

23:40.984 --> 23:42.769
Look, nobody wants Katya
more than I do.

23:42.812 --> 23:45.032
Don't be so arrogant.

23:45.075 --> 23:47.469
She disabled the GPS.

23:47.513 --> 23:49.384
Nice.

23:49.428 --> 23:52.082
I suppose my car has a
tracker or two now, as well?

23:52.126 --> 23:53.257
Tell us where Zasha is.

23:53.301 --> 23:55.129
Stay out of this.
This isn't your fight.

23:55.172 --> 23:56.086
You made it our fight

23:56.130 --> 23:57.479
when you grabbed Zasha Gagarin.

23:57.523 --> 23:59.655
And why is that?
What is she to you?

24:02.092 --> 24:03.398
She works for us.

24:07.446 --> 24:11.275
Oh, she's
your little Russian informant.

24:11.319 --> 24:12.842
How precious.

24:12.886 --> 24:14.365
You are such a hypocrite.

24:14.409 --> 24:16.411
You don't give a damn
about her. You just want

24:16.455 --> 24:19.588
her intel. You know, at least
I'm honest about my intentions.

24:21.721 --> 24:23.026
She's been in limbo.

24:23.070 --> 24:25.420
Possibly because
her people found out.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.770
They've been watching her.
They probably saw you grab her.

24:27.814 --> 24:29.032
Hell, they probably
followed you here.

24:29.076 --> 24:30.251
Yeah, nobody tailed me.

24:30.294 --> 24:32.732
You only have one play here.

24:32.775 --> 24:35.169
Make it fast.

24:35.212 --> 24:36.997
Or what?

24:37.040 --> 24:38.215
We arrest you.

24:40.870 --> 24:42.524
You have no jurisdiction
over me.

24:42.568 --> 24:44.004
We're federal agents.

24:44.047 --> 24:46.310
You kidnapped and assaulted
a foreign national.

24:46.354 --> 24:49.052
Keep it up, we'll hand you over
to the Russians.

24:51.054 --> 24:53.927
You arrest me,
and you'll never find her.

24:53.970 --> 24:56.669
She'll be dead from dehydration
within a week.

24:56.712 --> 24:58.497
You tell us

24:58.540 --> 25:00.020
where Zasha is right now,

25:00.063 --> 25:02.022
or I will bring proof
to your family

25:02.065 --> 25:03.414
that you're still alive.

25:03.458 --> 25:05.460
And all the love
they have for you

25:05.504 --> 25:09.029
will turn into white-hot hatred
for the rest of their lives.

25:10.987 --> 25:12.772
Or maybe they'll understand

25:12.815 --> 25:15.818
that it was the only way
I could protect them.

25:15.862 --> 25:18.038
That's a big maybe.

25:21.084 --> 25:22.782
Give me an hour to get her.

25:24.218 --> 25:26.263
Not a chance we're letting you
out of our sight.

25:26.307 --> 25:28.483
Okay, fine. Then you drive.

25:28.527 --> 25:29.832
Don't do something
else you'll regret.

25:41.931 --> 25:44.107
Can still see
your son grow up.

25:44.151 --> 25:46.240
You're not gonna be able
to do that from prison.

25:46.283 --> 25:47.633
Yeah, grow up without me.

25:47.676 --> 25:48.764
That was your decision.

25:48.808 --> 25:49.939
- Was it?
- All right, look,

25:49.983 --> 25:52.333
we can help you get Katya.

25:52.376 --> 25:54.596
Okay? But we have to work
together, and you've got

25:54.640 --> 25:57.512
to let Zasha go before
this thing can't be undone.

25:57.556 --> 25:59.035
Guys, you've got company.

25:59.079 --> 26:00.733
How many?

26:00.776 --> 26:02.125
Six.

26:02.822 --> 26:05.259
Six. You weren't tailed?

26:05.302 --> 26:08.001
You had a whole parade
following you. Nicely done.

26:08.044 --> 26:09.568
All right,
they're surrounding the place.

26:09.611 --> 26:10.873
Kensi and Deeks
are about ten minutes out.

26:10.917 --> 26:13.006
All right, you two
get over there.

26:13.049 --> 26:15.008
I'll ready a REACT team
and alert LAPD

26:15.051 --> 26:16.792
to secure the perimeter.

26:16.836 --> 26:18.359
Hopefully, these jokers

26:18.402 --> 26:19.708
will stand down
once they realize

26:19.752 --> 26:21.362
they're walking
into a hornet's nest

26:21.405 --> 26:23.451
- of federal agents.
- Now, I have a better idea.

26:23.494 --> 26:26.106
I don't recall
asking for suggestions.

26:26.149 --> 26:27.281
Sam and I will take Joelle

26:27.324 --> 26:28.456
to secure Zasha.

26:28.499 --> 26:29.849
Assuming she hasn't been
already taken.

26:29.892 --> 26:31.415
How are we gonna get out of here
if we're surrounded?

26:31.459 --> 26:33.592
I hope that mascara's
waterproof.

26:33.635 --> 26:35.463
Move. Move, move.

26:38.771 --> 26:39.902
You got to be kidding me.

26:39.946 --> 26:41.208
I'd rather face
the Russians

26:41.251 --> 26:43.514
than get typhoid from...

26:43.558 --> 26:45.212
You're welcome.

27:19.942 --> 27:21.465
<i>Hey.</i>

27:21.509 --> 27:23.467
We're out of the boathouse.
Redirect everyone to...

27:23.511 --> 27:25.861
Where we going?
Where we going?!

27:25.905 --> 27:27.994
2343 South Larson.

27:28.037 --> 27:30.866
2343 South Larson.
Let LAPD round up the Russians.

27:30.910 --> 27:32.912
They're not going anywhere
without an Uber.

27:32.955 --> 27:35.088
Hey, hey! Not
in the Hellcat.

27:35.131 --> 27:37.046
You're the one who pushed me
into the water.

27:37.090 --> 27:39.179
That's because
you led those guys to us.

27:39.222 --> 27:41.747
You know, I'm not even supposed
to get my prosthetic wet.

27:41.790 --> 27:43.357
If I have to get this thing
repaired or replaced,

27:43.400 --> 27:45.272
I'm sending NCIS the bill.

27:45.315 --> 27:47.274
The hell you are. You're paying
for this car to get detailed.

27:47.317 --> 27:49.798
Oh, dream on.

27:53.584 --> 27:55.369
Either of those cars yours?

27:55.412 --> 27:56.675
No.

27:56.718 --> 27:58.677
Wonderful.

28:01.592 --> 28:03.464
Tell the others
to go on earwigs.

28:03.507 --> 28:05.335
- Somebody beat us here.
- Are you guys gonna
give me a weapon?

28:05.379 --> 28:07.337
No. You're gonna stay here,
outside the car.

28:07.381 --> 28:08.556
You need
all the help you can get.

28:08.599 --> 28:10.210
The day I need your help
is the day I quit.

28:10.253 --> 28:12.125
Then I guess you should have
- quit a couple years ago.
- Enough.

28:12.168 --> 28:14.388
Backup's coming.

28:14.431 --> 28:16.477
Too late. Her people got her.

28:16.520 --> 28:18.044
Federal agents!

28:18.087 --> 28:19.393
Let the woman go!

28:22.004 --> 28:23.092
I don't think they care.

28:23.136 --> 28:24.137
Can I have a gun now?

28:24.180 --> 28:25.791
- No!
- No!

28:29.055 --> 28:31.013
We got to take out
their cars. Cover me.

29:00.608 --> 29:02.044
They went back in the building.

29:02.088 --> 29:04.307
At least four armed men,
possibly more inside.

29:04.351 --> 29:06.092
They're using Zasha
as a human shield.

29:06.135 --> 29:07.484
Yeah, where'd they
find these guys,

29:07.528 --> 29:08.834
- Craigslist?
- I'll go around the side

29:08.877 --> 29:09.965
in case they try
and sneak out the back.

29:10.009 --> 29:11.358
I'm just supposed
to wait here?

29:11.401 --> 29:12.707
You're welcome to leave.

29:12.751 --> 29:14.535
You know, you can be a real ass.

29:14.578 --> 29:16.102
You're still
welcome to leave.

29:21.716 --> 29:23.500
Federal agent!
Throw down your weapon!

29:26.852 --> 29:28.505
G, you good?

29:28.549 --> 29:29.768
I just drove him back inside.

29:29.811 --> 29:31.030
I don't think
it's gonna last, though.

29:31.073 --> 29:32.814
Just give me a gun.
Let me get in there.

29:32.858 --> 29:34.294
This is my mess. Let me fix it.

29:34.337 --> 29:36.426
We are fixing it. This is
what fixing it looks like.

29:36.470 --> 29:38.211
Where's everybody else?
- Who's close?
Four minutes out,

29:38.254 --> 29:39.865
- guys. Sit tight.
We're even closer.

29:39.908 --> 29:42.476
- Almost there.
- I'll send Rountree in as
soon as they get here.

29:42.519 --> 29:44.434
- Copy that.
- Hey! Hey! Hey, hey!

29:44.478 --> 29:45.305
What? What's happened?

29:45.348 --> 29:47.046
Joelle just ran inside.

29:47.089 --> 29:48.612
Son of a bitch.

29:48.656 --> 29:50.701
I should have drowned her
when I had the chance.

29:59.319 --> 30:01.147
We got a plan?

30:01.190 --> 30:03.105
Well, I tried waiting them out,
but I got a feeling they're not

30:03.149 --> 30:05.194
gonna be in there
any longer than they have to.

30:06.195 --> 30:08.328
You weren't going to this party
without me, were you?

30:08.371 --> 30:10.286
Wouldn't dream of it. With
Joelle going in there,

30:10.330 --> 30:11.853
we may be up to
two hostages.

30:11.897 --> 30:12.854
If I was them,
I'd try to split up

30:12.898 --> 30:13.855
and escape
in different directions.

30:13.899 --> 30:15.465
Divide our resources.

30:15.509 --> 30:17.990
The building schematics have
just been sent to your phones.

30:18.033 --> 30:21.297
I shouldn't need to remind you,
but I probably do.

30:21.341 --> 30:23.299
These are foreign operatives

30:23.343 --> 30:25.780
ostensibly rescuing
one of their own

30:25.824 --> 30:27.869
from a rogue CIA officer.

30:27.913 --> 30:29.871
They were using Zasha
as a human shield.

30:29.915 --> 30:31.655
You have body cam footage
of this,

30:31.699 --> 30:33.962
- Agent Callen? I didn't think so.
- We can s...

30:34.006 --> 30:35.616
Now, this is already

30:35.659 --> 30:37.357
an international incident.

30:37.400 --> 30:40.142
You start racking up bodies,
it's just gonna get worse.

30:40.186 --> 30:42.710
At the moment,
this is a CIA problem.

30:42.753 --> 30:44.233
I do not need

30:44.277 --> 30:46.496
NCIS dragged into it, as well.

30:46.540 --> 30:48.672
News flash, Admiral.
We're already in it.

30:48.716 --> 30:49.978
Nonlethal,

30:50.022 --> 30:51.023
ladies and gentlemen.

30:51.066 --> 30:52.198
Is he kidding?

30:52.241 --> 30:53.852
No, Agent Blye.

30:53.895 --> 30:56.550
I am dead serious,
no pun intended.

30:56.593 --> 30:59.335
Now, this shouldn't be a problem
for your team

30:59.379 --> 31:01.729
if you're all as good

31:01.772 --> 31:03.862
as you seem to think you are.

31:04.863 --> 31:07.213
Can I get an amen?

31:07.256 --> 31:09.606
- Copy that, sir.
They may be willing to free

31:09.650 --> 31:11.782
Zasha and leave Joelle if
we offer them safe passage,

31:11.826 --> 31:13.349
but I'm not betting on anything.

31:13.393 --> 31:14.960
Deeks and I will take
the high ground.

31:15.003 --> 31:16.787
Rountree will stay
and cover this side.

31:16.831 --> 31:18.398
Okay, Kensi and I will breach
and make them an offer.

31:18.441 --> 31:19.921
Fatima will cover
our entry.

31:19.965 --> 31:22.576
I like this plan.
It just feels like a winner.

31:36.633 --> 31:38.244
We're federal agents!

31:38.287 --> 31:39.636
There's no way

31:39.680 --> 31:41.551
you're getting out of here
unless we let you!

31:41.595 --> 31:44.032
We can do that
if you send Zasha out!

31:44.076 --> 31:46.513
You can leave without her!

31:47.601 --> 31:49.081
Zasha, do you hear us?

31:51.083 --> 31:52.475
Joelle?

31:52.519 --> 31:53.955
Joelle, go back to the car

31:53.999 --> 31:55.739
before you make things worse!

32:04.226 --> 32:06.402
All right, this is
the real deal, gentlemen.

32:06.446 --> 32:08.230
But it's a limited time offer!

32:08.274 --> 32:09.840
Leave while you still can!

32:09.884 --> 32:11.494
You try anything stupid,

32:11.538 --> 32:13.801
you're going
to prison instead.

32:15.150 --> 32:17.370
I hope these guys speak English.

32:17.413 --> 32:19.285
Callen, you see anything?

32:19.328 --> 32:21.026
I can't see anything
through this glass.

32:21.069 --> 32:22.853
What are the chances
of us getting satellite images

32:22.897 --> 32:26.335
- of their heat signatures?
- About the same
as my getting a permanent.

32:26.379 --> 32:28.120
Maybe I should just send in

32:28.163 --> 32:31.558
a couple of robots with jetpacks
to do this for you.

32:31.601 --> 32:33.690
Hell, in Vietnam,
we were lucky if they

32:33.734 --> 32:35.605
gave us maps,
and we were in the jungle,

32:35.649 --> 32:37.042
not Boyle Heights.

32:37.085 --> 32:38.913
Yeah. Maybe that's why we
did so well over there.

32:38.957 --> 32:40.828
Stow that crap, Hanna,
or your next assignment

32:40.871 --> 32:42.612
will be in Djibouti.

32:42.656 --> 32:44.963
That's the type of Djibouti
call you don't want to get.

32:55.886 --> 32:57.105
Our boys

32:57.149 --> 32:58.541
are in a tight 360
using the women as cover.

32:58.585 --> 33:00.326
We don't have a shot.

33:00.369 --> 33:02.458
Okay, well, this is like
looking through egg drop soup.

33:02.502 --> 33:04.025
- We can't see a thing.
I say

33:04.069 --> 33:05.200
we hit them all at once.

33:05.244 --> 33:06.375
Try and catch them
in the confusion.

33:06.419 --> 33:08.421
Shock and awe
is my specialty.

33:08.464 --> 33:09.944
God, I wish.

33:13.078 --> 33:15.428
Let me know
when everyone's in position.

33:15.471 --> 33:16.646
I'm good.

33:18.344 --> 33:20.041
Fatima?

33:20.085 --> 33:22.087
I'll just be one second.

33:22.130 --> 33:24.089
God, the kids are so cute
at this age, are they not?

33:24.132 --> 33:25.612
Agent Namazi?

33:25.655 --> 33:26.830
Almost there.

33:30.008 --> 33:31.357
We got to go now.

33:31.400 --> 33:32.793
Move!

33:34.012 --> 33:35.622
Go.

33:44.892 --> 33:46.502
Federal agents! Stay down!

33:46.546 --> 33:48.200
- Don't you move!
- Hands behind your head.

33:48.243 --> 33:49.375
Interlock your fingers.

33:49.418 --> 33:50.680
- Now.
Yo,

33:50.724 --> 33:52.204
- you good?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Fine.

33:52.247 --> 33:54.989
What in God's green heaven
is going on there?

33:55.033 --> 33:57.600
All good. No casualties.

33:57.644 --> 34:00.212
Did you blow something up?

34:00.255 --> 34:01.865
Just a little broken glass.

34:03.128 --> 34:05.695
Looks like you're gonna
need more than a detail.

34:05.739 --> 34:07.175
What the hell was that?

34:07.219 --> 34:09.612
Callen said shock and awe.
That was shock.

34:09.656 --> 34:11.136
Looks like you got the awe.

34:11.179 --> 34:13.268
Except for you,
it was more like, "Aw."

34:14.443 --> 34:16.358
- You okay?
- Yeah.

34:16.402 --> 34:18.230
Joelle, stop!

34:18.273 --> 34:19.318
Stop!

34:19.361 --> 34:20.797
I got her.

34:23.278 --> 34:25.150
Oh! Oh, wow.

34:25.193 --> 34:26.542
- Ooh.
That looks like

34:26.586 --> 34:27.848
it hurts more than getting shot.

34:27.891 --> 34:29.850
I'm gonna be honest with you.

34:29.893 --> 34:31.591
This thing is way faster
than I thought it would be.

34:31.634 --> 34:32.853
I mean, it's a monster.

34:34.420 --> 34:35.899
That was hilarious.
Oh, it was hilarious?

34:35.943 --> 34:38.119
Wreck my car,
it's hilarious?

34:38.163 --> 34:40.730
- It's hilarious.
- Sorry, Sam.

34:41.992 --> 34:43.603
I'll show you hilarious.

34:43.646 --> 34:44.821
It's not funny.

34:44.865 --> 34:46.997
I mean, it's a little hilar...

34:47.041 --> 34:49.087
Not funny. Mm-mm.

34:50.044 --> 34:52.002
- Thanks.
- Sure.

34:57.182 --> 35:00.533
So, now what?
You arresting me?

35:02.187 --> 35:04.189
What you did today
was unacceptable.

35:04.232 --> 35:06.930
What they did to <i>me
- was unacceptable.
- And what you did</i>

35:06.974 --> 35:09.063
to Zasha was...?

35:14.329 --> 35:18.290
Look, we have a mutual interest
in finding Katya.

35:19.291 --> 35:20.596
But if you

35:20.640 --> 35:21.728
cross the line again,

35:21.771 --> 35:24.034
I will put you away for good.

35:26.254 --> 35:27.995
- Callen?

35:33.653 --> 35:36.134
Would you really have told
my family I was still alive?

35:38.484 --> 35:40.486
What do you think?

35:44.838 --> 35:47.188
I think
if you ever go near my family

35:47.232 --> 35:48.711
with that intention,

35:48.755 --> 35:50.757
I'll kill you.

35:52.759 --> 35:55.414
It's good to see you again,
too, Joelle.

36:06.990 --> 36:08.992
My tummy is growling
like Winnie-the-Pooh.

36:09.036 --> 36:10.907
I want paneer. You want to stop

36:10.951 --> 36:12.344
at Frankie's
on the way home?

36:12.387 --> 36:13.780
I'm still thinking
about my conversation

36:13.823 --> 36:16.217
- with Hetty today.
- And?

36:17.914 --> 36:21.135
Wow. You want to
talk about it?

36:25.487 --> 36:28.795
Adoption is amazing.

36:28.838 --> 36:30.231
- Mm-hmm.
- You know?

36:30.275 --> 36:33.234
And the idea of...

36:33.278 --> 36:36.411
giving a child a safe home
and a loving family

36:36.455 --> 36:38.196
is such a privilege.

36:39.197 --> 36:42.678
And I'd probably want
to do that regardless.

36:42.722 --> 36:44.767
But?

36:47.466 --> 36:50.730
I just really wanted us
to have a baby together.

36:52.688 --> 36:54.777
Yeah, me, too.

36:54.821 --> 36:57.737
Little genetic
ninja assassins.

36:59.304 --> 37:01.480
But...

37:01.523 --> 37:04.874
then I think about all the
things that had to happen

37:04.918 --> 37:06.528
to get us where
we are right now.

37:06.572 --> 37:08.704
Right? I think about
your mom and her life.

37:08.748 --> 37:10.489
I think about
your dad and his.

37:10.532 --> 37:11.838
I think about Mama Deeks.

37:11.881 --> 37:13.448
I think about my
despicable father

37:13.492 --> 37:15.320
and their parents and
their parents before them,

37:15.363 --> 37:18.192
and I realize, like,
all these things

37:18.236 --> 37:20.412
brought us to where we are
right now in the process,

37:20.455 --> 37:24.590
and so maybe all we have to do
is just trust the universe.

37:24.633 --> 37:26.592
Right?

37:26.635 --> 37:29.682
What if the universe
doesn't want us to have a baby?

37:30.639 --> 37:34.034
Well, then forget
everything I said,

37:34.077 --> 37:35.905
and the universe
can bite me.

37:35.949 --> 37:37.690
We'll just do what
rich people do,

37:37.733 --> 37:39.996
and we'll just
- steal our babies.
- You can't say that.

37:40.040 --> 37:41.346
We'll just travel
all over the globe

37:41.389 --> 37:42.738
and get a bunch of
different babies,

37:42.782 --> 37:44.087
all different ethnicities.

37:44.131 --> 37:45.654
And Angelina Jolie
will be jealous

37:45.698 --> 37:48.135
'cause we have a whole soccer
team. It's gonna be great.

37:48.178 --> 37:51.007
We live in a two-bedroom
house. It's gonna be fine.

37:52.879 --> 37:55.098
Oh, you always know
what to say

37:55.142 --> 37:56.665
to cheer me up.

37:56.709 --> 37:58.754
Well, that may be
my superpower.
Oh, yeah?

37:58.798 --> 38:00.626
Yeah. Making you laugh,
that may be my gift.

38:00.669 --> 38:03.019
Okay, well, what's the
refund policy on that gift?

38:03.063 --> 38:04.804
Oh, that's
store credit only.
Ugh.

38:04.847 --> 38:06.675
No cashing out
at this point, baby girl.

38:06.719 --> 38:09.199
Lucky, lucky me.

38:14.814 --> 38:16.990
Afraid you missed her.

38:17.033 --> 38:19.558
She's gone.

38:19.601 --> 38:22.212
Where is she?
Or is that classified?

38:22.256 --> 38:23.823
It is,

38:23.866 --> 38:26.304
but she's probably gonna
get herself killed, anyway,

38:26.347 --> 38:27.522
so what the hell?

38:27.566 --> 38:28.610
Syria.

38:28.654 --> 38:29.872
Trying to clean up a mess

38:29.916 --> 38:31.309
of her own doing.

38:31.352 --> 38:33.789
To be honest, I didn't think
she'd make it back

38:33.833 --> 38:35.400
the first time, so who knows.

38:35.443 --> 38:36.966
She's harder to kill

38:37.010 --> 38:39.621
than that cockroach
everyone seems to love.

38:39.665 --> 38:41.623
What is she doing over there?

38:41.667 --> 38:42.842
I just told you, she is

38:42.885 --> 38:43.886
cleaning up... Specifically.

38:43.930 --> 38:46.193
Well, that is classified.

38:46.236 --> 38:49.152
Let's just say
that her great white whale hunt

38:49.196 --> 38:50.328
went south,

38:50.371 --> 38:51.981
and now some others
are paying for it.

38:52.982 --> 38:55.028
Why aren't we helping her?

38:55.071 --> 38:58.553
Because you don't throw good
money after bad, Agent Callen.

38:58.597 --> 39:01.382
Hopefully, she'll be able
to pull another rabbit

39:01.426 --> 39:03.471
out of her hat.
She does have a knack for it,

39:03.515 --> 39:04.646
I'll give her that.

39:04.690 --> 39:06.256
And if she doesn't?

39:20.183 --> 39:22.403
<i>I guess I owe you a thank you.</i>

39:23.448 --> 39:27.277
It's not mandatory, but it is
considered a polite gesture.

39:29.105 --> 39:31.238
If there was any doubt before,

39:31.281 --> 39:34.372
I'm definitely burned now.

39:34.415 --> 39:36.461
Yeah.

39:36.504 --> 39:38.376
But you're free.

39:38.419 --> 39:40.856
To be hunted
for the rest of my life.

39:43.468 --> 39:45.731
I don't even have
- a country anymore.
- Well,

39:45.774 --> 39:48.386
these days, that might
actually be a good thing.

39:51.345 --> 39:53.826
You do me one more favor,

39:53.869 --> 39:55.784
and I will help you.

39:55.828 --> 39:57.264
Another favor?

39:57.307 --> 39:58.787
I have

39:58.831 --> 40:00.963
nothing but the clothes
I'm wearing because of you.

40:02.312 --> 40:04.314
Do you have a better option?

40:09.972 --> 40:12.018
What do you want me to do?

40:15.500 --> 40:18.198
I want you to keep
an eye on someone.

40:18.241 --> 40:20.069
Tell me what they're doing.

40:22.071 --> 40:23.333
You want me

40:23.377 --> 40:24.770
to go to Syria?

40:24.813 --> 40:27.076
You'll be safer there
than you are here.

40:30.645 --> 40:32.647
Who's this? Your mother?

40:32.691 --> 40:35.389
Please. You know who that is
as well as I do.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.435
Maybe better.

40:38.436 --> 40:41.090
Yeah, we know who she is.

40:41.134 --> 40:43.092
What's she doing in Syria?

40:43.136 --> 40:46.792
That is what you're
gonna find out.

40:48.794 --> 40:51.536
Sydney Violet Richards.

40:53.102 --> 40:54.626
My initials are SVR?

40:54.669 --> 40:56.628
Is this your idea of humor?

40:56.671 --> 40:58.847
I thought it could be
our little inside joke.

40:58.891 --> 41:00.936
Hilarious.
Hmm.

41:01.937 --> 41:03.939
This passport expires
in eight months.

41:03.983 --> 41:05.463
Yeah, that sucks.

41:05.506 --> 41:07.987
But this should not take
more than a few weeks.

41:08.030 --> 41:10.032
You do this,

41:10.076 --> 41:12.687
I will get you legit,
government-issued papers.

41:14.994 --> 41:17.649
And you can even pick
your own name.

41:22.697 --> 41:24.307
<i>The subject shows</i>

41:24.351 --> 41:26.571
<i>an exceptional memory.</i>

41:26.614 --> 41:30.836
<i>Given the proper opportunity
and education,</i>

41:30.879 --> 41:33.621
<i>there's no telling
what he could achieve.</i>
