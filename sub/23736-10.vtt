not here yet?

00:18.686 --> 00:20.319

stop at his house

00:20.321 --> 00:22.721
and put on some
yoga pants.

00:22.723 --> 00:24.423

can it take a guy

00:24.425 --> 00:26.392
to change his pants?!?

00:26.394 --> 00:28.027

00:57.458 --> 01:00.325

01:00.828 --> 01:02.261
- Hey guys,

01:02.263 --> 01:05.564

lay back on each other.

01:13.107 --> 01:15.607
Lay back on my side.

01:32.726 --> 01:36.161

Proud of you.

01:39.166 --> 01:41.633
- Okay, I pulled
out the chairs.

01:41.635 --> 01:43.469
You guys wanna use me
for anything else?

01:43.471 --> 01:44.803
- No thanks!
- Buh-bye now.

01:44.805 --> 01:46.705
- Thank you for

01:46.707 --> 01:50.542

04:56.830 --> 04:59.798
One of those tickets
is for me...

04:59.800 --> 05:01.066
'cuz for my seventh
birthday party,

05:01.068 --> 05:04.469
my parents rented a horse
for all the kids to ride,

05:04.471 --> 05:07.572
and the horse died!

05:07.574 --> 05:08.674
Okay?

05:08.676 --> 05:09.975
And there I was--

05:09.977 --> 05:10.842
Seven years old,

05:10.844 --> 05:12.044
wearin'
the prettiest little

05:12.046 --> 05:15.013
birthday skirt
you ever saw.

05:15.015 --> 05:17.049
In my back yard
with a dead horse

05:17.051 --> 05:18.850
wearin' a party hat.

05:18.852 --> 05:20.819
- I'm sorry, I'm just
a little confused.

05:20.821 --> 05:23.322
Was it...
were you wearing the party hat?

05:23.324 --> 05:24.489
Or was the dead horse wear--

05:24.491 --> 05:27.392
- It doesn't matter!!

05:28.095 --> 05:30.996
The point is I get
to go see Flavor City!

05:30.998 --> 05:32.397
- Oh wow,

05:32.399 --> 05:35.033
y'know your story
is so crazy to me

05:35.035 --> 05:38.070
because the exact
same thing happened to me.

05:38.072 --> 05:42.074
Yeah y'know, horse,
party hat, death,

05:42.076 --> 05:44.443
so I guess you and I both

05:44.445 --> 05:46.511
get to go see Flavor City.

05:46.513 --> 05:48.347
That's weird.

05:48.349 --> 05:52.684
- Well, Dub's my dad
so I have to go.

05:54.388 --> 05:56.955
- Awwwwww.
- Awww.

05:56.957 --> 05:59.558
- Hey, it's cool.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.093
- Really?

06:01.095 --> 06:02.461
- You don't mind
not going?

06:02.463 --> 06:04.529
- Oh, I'm gonna go.

06:04.965 --> 06:08.133
- But...
there's no ticket for you.

06:08.135 --> 06:09.368
- Correct.

06:09.370 --> 06:11.903
- But then you can't go.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.605
- Wrong.

06:13.607 --> 06:14.172
- Huh?

06:14.174 --> 06:16.141
- I'm goin'
to Flavor City.

06:16.143 --> 06:18.143
I just have
one question.

06:18.145 --> 06:18.744
- What?

06:18.746 --> 06:19.978
- At your birthday party...

06:19.980 --> 06:22.647
when you first saw
the horse fall over...

06:22.649 --> 06:23.715
- Yeah...?

06:23.717 --> 06:24.683
- Did you TRY...

06:24.685 --> 06:26.885
mouth-to-horse
resuscitation?

06:29.490 --> 06:32.758
- Horses don't have lips.

06:33.861 --> 06:36.395
¶ Now let me see
the club go off ¶

06:36.397 --> 06:37.562
¶ When I step on the mic ¶

06:37.564 --> 06:39.431
¶ Game Shakers in the spot ¶

06:39.433 --> 06:40.599
¶ And it's popping tonight ¶

06:40.601 --> 06:42.901

06:42.903 --> 06:43.902

06:43.904 --> 06:45.704
¶ So when you hear

06:45.706 --> 06:48.640
¶ You better drop dat what ¶

06:48.642 --> 06:49.574
¶ Drop dat ¶

06:49.576 --> 06:51.743
¶ Let the bass get low ¶

06:51.745 --> 06:52.644
¶ Drop dat ¶

06:52.646 --> 06:55.180
¶ And make the whole club go ¶

06:55.182 --> 06:56.114
¶ Drop dat ¶

06:56.116 --> 06:58.450
¶ Cuz I can't get enough
when you ¶

06:58.452 --> 06:59.117
¶ Drop dat ¶

06:59.119 --> 07:01.553
¶ But you better pick it up ¶

07:01.555 --> 07:03.655
¶ Drop dat ¶

07:08.061 --> 07:09.528
- Everyone,
please find your seats.

07:09.530 --> 07:13.865
Flavor City will begin
in ten minutes. Thank you.

07:14.067 --> 07:15.901
- And we're in!
Oh my God, Kenzie,

07:15.903 --> 07:18.203
I cannot believe we're about

07:18.205 --> 07:20.472
- I know!
- Yeah, oh yeah, look out!

07:20.474 --> 07:21.773
- What game
are you playin'?

07:21.775 --> 07:24.676
- Oh it's a game we made,
called The Fight House.

07:24.678 --> 07:25.977
- Yeah, and some
dude emailed us

07:25.979 --> 07:27.679
sayin' that if you
pick Abraham Lincoln,

07:27.681 --> 07:29.247
it's impossible to
beat George Washington--

07:29.249 --> 07:31.883
so I picked Lincoln,
and I'm gonna prove

07:31.885 --> 07:32.918
that anyone can beat--

07:32.920 --> 07:35.153
[ bang ]
D'awwwwww!!!

07:35.155 --> 07:35.787
- What?

07:35.789 --> 07:38.223
- George Washington
kicked Abe Lincoln in the neck

07:38.225 --> 07:39.624
and knocked his hat off
in the hog pit.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.893
- Hey, y'know you're
not supposed to have

07:41.895 --> 07:42.761
your phone out in here.

07:42.763 --> 07:44.062
- Yeah, you wanna
get us kicked out?!?

07:44.064 --> 07:46.631
- Nobody's gonna
kick us out--

07:48.268 --> 07:51.002
- What's up everybody?!?

07:51.004 --> 07:53.738
Nothin' unusual

08:01.715 --> 08:04.783
I guess I'm just feelin'

08:04.785 --> 08:07.018
