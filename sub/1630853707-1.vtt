Linda: Well,
that's the first time

01:19.871 --> 01:21.957
an exterminator said
he's gonna pray for us.

01:22.040 --> 01:23.601
That's okay, right?
That's not a bad sign.

01:23.625 --> 01:25.877
- No.
- Whatcha doin', gene?

01:26.044 --> 01:27.837
I'm making an instrument
out of spoons,

01:27.921 --> 01:29.881
and a napkin holder,
and dreams, and magic.

01:30.048 --> 01:31.174
Obviously, Tina.

01:31.341 --> 01:32.342
How's the burger, Bob?

01:32.467 --> 01:34.219
Bob: It's okay.
| put an egg on it.

01:34.386 --> 01:36.179
Why is dad making a burger
at8:00 A.M.?

01:36.346 --> 01:37.472
Is he on British time?

01:37.639 --> 01:39.724
He's making it to bring
to Mr. Dowling at the bank.

01:39.808 --> 01:40.868
We have a meeting this morning

01:40.892 --> 01:41.994
and we're gonna ask
for an extension

01:42.018 --> 01:43.019
on our loan payment.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.104
Oh, fun.

01:44.271 --> 01:46.481
And we really, really need
to get that extension.

01:46.648 --> 01:48.942
All the restaurant equipment
is wrapped up in that loan.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.111
S0, you're giving him a burger?

01:51.278 --> 01:53.321
Al e[
We can't give him money, Tina.

01:53.488 --> 01:54.840
- 'Cause we don't have any?
- Pretty much.

01:54.864 --> 01:56.324
How about you play him
some of this?

01:56.408 --> 01:57.951
- (Rattling)
- What, to scare him?

01:58.159 --> 01:59.536
No. To enchant him.

01:59.786 --> 02:02.038
Bob, you know | love this
"bring him a burger" idea,

02:02.163 --> 02:03.915
but isn't it a little early
to be making it?

02:04.082 --> 02:05.722
| mean, our appointment
isn't for a while.

02:05.875 --> 02:07.395
(Whispering)
This is a practice burger.

02:07.544 --> 02:08.943
(Whispering)
Why are you whispering?

02:09.003 --> 02:10.922
| don't want it to hear
and feel bad.

02:11.006 --> 02:12.007
Okay.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.276
(In female voice)
Wait, I'm a what?

02:13.300 --> 02:15.885
(In normal voice) Nothing.
What? You're great. (Shushes)

02:15.969 --> 02:17.363
(In female voice)
Mmm, that feels nice.

02:17.387 --> 02:18.667
(In normal voice)
| know. | know.

02:18.763 --> 02:20.643
(In female voice)
Don't rub my sesame seeds off.

02:20.807 --> 02:22.326
(In normal voice)
| won't. Don't worry.

02:22.350 --> 02:24.394
- They're a cute couple.
- Eh, I give 'em a year.

02:25.103 --> 02:27.147
I'm gonna make
another practice burger.

02:27.314 --> 02:29.065
And I'm gonna try
not to think too much

02:29.149 --> 02:30.469
about how much
is riding on today.

02:30.608 --> 02:32.027
Maybe | should put
two eggs on it.

02:32.193 --> 02:34.029
Hey! This could be
your burger of the day!

02:34.195 --> 02:36.573
You can call it your,
"keep your sunny side up

02:36.656 --> 02:37.782
"and your cloudy side down,

02:37.991 --> 02:39.326
"stay positive, Bobby,

02:39.409 --> 02:40.744
"things are gonna be okay
burger."

02:40.910 --> 02:42.620
- Right?
- Bob: It's a little long.

02:42.746 --> 02:43.747
How about "Mr. Greasy"?

02:43.830 --> 02:44.956
Well, better get going.

02:45.123 --> 02:48.209
Only one more week of school
and then I'm summer Tina.

02:48.376 --> 02:50.016
And big things are comin’
for summer Tina.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.090
Big things like that heat rash
you get sometimes?

02:52.130 --> 02:53.131
Bigger.

02:53.214 --> 02:54.341
Summer Louise might be

02:54.424 --> 02:56.176
making some moves
that are pretty big, too.

02:56.259 --> 02:57.302
Maybe. | don't know.

02:57.385 --> 02:58.529
Don't worry about it, all right?

02:58.553 --> 02:59.554
Tina: Fine. Sorry.

02:59.637 --> 03:01.723
Summer gene's
gonna be topless 24/7

03:01.806 --> 03:03.433
- and doin' a lot of this.
- (Rattling)

03:03.933 --> 03:05.161
- Louise: Oh, great.
- Bye, my babies.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.287
Watch out
for the messed up sidewalk!

03:06.311 --> 03:07.312
Tina: Thank you!

03:07.395 --> 03:09.647
(Cheerful music playing)

03:11.775 --> 03:13.455
Bob: (Singing)
Every day we come downstairs

03:13.485 --> 03:14.569
unlock the door

03:14.652 --> 03:17.113
and turn the sign to open

03:17.739 --> 03:19.115
open

03:19.324 --> 03:23.161
is another day | give myself
a little diarrhea

03:23.370 --> 03:25.497
from the worry
and the stressin’'

03:25.580 --> 03:27.540
and the hopin’

03:27.916 --> 03:30.076
-but | won't think about
-but you shouldn't think about

03:30.126 --> 03:31.544
those fears nhow

03:31.753 --> 03:35.590
Mr. Dowling at the bank
is gonna say, "oh, wow"

03:35.757 --> 03:37.884
when he tastes our burgers,
tastes our fries

03:38.093 --> 03:40.053
he'll probably give us
a high-five

03:40.220 --> 03:42.180
extend our loan, throw us a bone

03:42.305 --> 03:43.348
and tell us we are

03:43.431 --> 03:44.474
-in the zone
-yeah!

03:44.557 --> 03:46.267
-Send us on our merry way
-mm-hmm.

03:46.351 --> 03:48.186
Hey, have yourselves
a pleasant day

03:48.353 --> 03:50.271
both: We'll come back here,
we'll go berserk

03:50.355 --> 03:51.398
we'll hug and kiss

03:51.564 --> 03:52.941
and get to work

03:53.024 --> 03:56.486
oh, Bobby,
| like what I'm hearin’'

03:56.736 --> 03:59.697
diarrhea’s fine,
but no sense fearin'

03:59.864 --> 04:00.949
- l mean.
- Uh!

04:01.032 --> 04:04.119
When you have that
just UN-stop-timistic spirit

04:04.285 --> 04:06.579
it's gonna be the sunny side up

04:06.663 --> 04:09.249
summer of our lives

04:09.332 --> 04:11.084
ooh

04:11.334 --> 04:12.710
every time | see him

04:12.794 --> 04:15.672
oh, my heart,
it does a crazy little dance

04:15.880 --> 04:17.798
something like, eh, eh, eh.

04:17.882 --> 04:18.925
Looks good.

04:19.007 --> 04:20.885
And | want for him to kiss me

04:20.969 --> 04:23.096
and then walk away so | can see

04:23.263 --> 04:25.974
what's shakin'in the backside
of his pants

04:26.141 --> 04:27.225
poop?

04:27.392 --> 04:31.271
| think that this is real,
what | feel

04:31.438 --> 04:35.233
and if he could feel it too
well then that would be ideal

04:35.358 --> 04:37.610
so | wanna make this thing legit

04:37.694 --> 04:39.654
-I'm gonna put a ring on it
-oon.

04:39.737 --> 04:41.614
But not a ring
‘cause that's cray-cray

04:41.698 --> 04:43.575
I mean,
we're only in eighth grade

04:43.658 --> 04:45.618
I'll do the thing
eighth graders do

04:45.702 --> 04:48.037
when you like-like me
and | like-like you

04:48.121 --> 04:49.956
put something special on a chain

04:50.039 --> 04:52.041
and give it to him and explain

04:52.125 --> 04:55.712
I'd like for you
to be my summer boyfriend

04:55.879 --> 04:57.755
you'll say yes
and then to seal it

04:57.839 --> 04:59.716
shake your rear end

05:00.049 --> 05:04.554
and it's gonna be
the sunny side up

05:04.721 --> 05:08.558
summer of my life

05:08.892 --> 05:13.396
each and every day
| want to sing

05:13.563 --> 05:15.982
| want to play

05:16.149 --> 05:20.945
play this napkiny thing, | made it

05:21.112 --> 05:25.158
and it's gonna revolutionize
American pop music

05:25.408 --> 05:28.161
each and every day

05:28.369 --> 05:32.123
| just think I'm pretty great

05:32.332 --> 05:36.377
yep, that's right no big deal

05:36.544 --> 05:40.089
I'm not hiding what | feel

05:40.298 --> 05:44.177
about some things on my mind

05:44.344 --> 05:48.640
and if they're holding me behind

05:48.806 --> 05:52.810
keeping me feeling small

05:52.977 --> 05:56.564
though they actually
make me tall

05:56.731 --> 06:01.069
hope they don't hear me
talkin' about them

06:01.236 --> 06:05.198
don't know
what | am without them

06:05.365 --> 06:09.285
-but this summer | might see
-but this summer we might see

06:09.452 --> 06:13.289
-just who I turn out to be
-just what we turned out to be

06:13.498 --> 06:18.378
and it's gonna be
the sunny side up

06:18.711 --> 06:21.756
summer of our lives

06:22.674 --> 06:26.761
guess we're gonna go for it
feels kinda scary, I'll admit

06:26.928 --> 06:28.721
it will be great, it's gonna work

06:28.805 --> 06:30.890
we'll hug and kiss
and go berserk

06:31.057 --> 06:32.767
I'll take a chance, don't second guess

06:32.976 --> 06:37.939
we're doing great
if he just answers yes

06:38.273 --> 06:40.275
(both vocalizing end note)

06:42.151 --> 06:43.194
- No.
- Both: Huh?

06:43.278 --> 06:45.029
- I'm sorry. Extension denied.
- Bob: Huh?

06:45.113 --> 06:47.073
You have seven days
to make your payment

06:47.240 --> 06:49.659
or we'll repossess
your restaurant equipment.

06:49.826 --> 06:50.910
Seven days?

06:51.077 --> 06:53.371
Possess our equipment?
Like, haunt it?

06:53.538 --> 06:55.081
| brought you a burger.

06:55.164 --> 06:56.165
Oh, no thanks.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.726
- I'm trying to eat less meat.
- Oh, my god.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.377
I'm going to close out the file.

06:59.460 --> 07:01.421
And, uh,
your faces are making me

07:01.879 --> 07:02.880
sad,

07:02.964 --> 07:04.882
so if you could go?

07:05.049 --> 07:06.050
Oh, my face?

07:06.217 --> 07:08.469
And can you take
the, um... hmm?

07:08.553 --> 07:10.888
There's fries in there.
You want the fries?

07:11.055 --> 07:13.725
Typing till you're gone.
Typing till you're gone.

07:14.142 --> 07:15.560
(Rattling)

07:16.769 --> 07:19.564
And that is the breakthrough
we've been looking for.

07:19.731 --> 07:22.108
It hurts my teeth somehow.
Also who's "we"?

07:22.275 --> 07:25.361
The band! Our underappreciated
but highly influential band,

07:25.528 --> 07:27.113
the itty bitty ditty committee?

07:27.280 --> 07:28.740
That we're in with my sisters.

07:28.906 --> 07:30.992
And recorder bad boy,
Peter pescadero.

07:31.159 --> 07:33.828
- Oh, right. We were in a band.
- And we went with that name?

07:33.995 --> 07:36.414
Yes! And we were just waiting

We didn't get the extension,

more business

09:16.556 --> 09:17.557
down at the wonder wharf

09:17.640 --> 09:18.909
[=lvet n the octa-wharfiversary!

09:18.933 --> 09:20.893
Oh, yeanh,
the octa-wharfiversary.

09:21.060 --> 09:22.228
More foot traffic.

09:22.311 --> 09:24.230
Uh, yeah. That's true.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.606
And feet have mouths.

09:25.773 --> 09:27.817
Mouths that we could put
burgers in. Right, Bob?

09:27.984 --> 09:29.610
Yeah. Feet have mouths.

09:29.694 --> 09:31.171
- (Laughs) Feet mouths.

09:31.195 --> 09:32.613
Ls =r r y =1-s

09:32.697 --> 09:34.341
doesn't it feel good
to be a little hopeful?

09:34.365 --> 09:36.033
Instead of being scary
and shouty.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.578
And making people feel nervous
to ask about their order.

09:38.745 --> 09:40.288
Yeah, it does a little bit.

09:40.455 --> 09:44.250
(Singing) /t's gonna be
the sunny side up

09:44.333 --> 09:45.334
come on!

09:45.418 --> 09:49.255
-Both: Summer of our lives
-(Cheerful music playing)

09:49.338 --> 09:51.174

09:55.803 --> 09:58.514
Huh? Oh! Oh! Oh!

09:59.599 --> 10:01.934
(Dramatic music playing)

10:05.980 --> 10:08.024
Oh, my god.

10:08.566 --> 10:10.318
Linda: If's not so bad.

10:10.485 --> 10:12.405
Louise: Especially if
you're into huge sinkholes.

10:12.487 --> 10:14.030
| mean, you can't get
tari{Al=ne[E]e] &

10:14.113 --> 10:15.656
customers need that, usually,

10:15.823 --> 10:18.117
to be able to
get into the restaurant.

10:18.284 --> 10:19.535
Linda: Oh, hey, Mr. Dowling.

10:19.702 --> 10:22.497
Don't worry about this at all.
We're doing great!

10:22.663 --> 10:23.956
Seven days! (Chuckles)

10:24.040 --> 10:25.833
He's shaking his head,
but that's probably

10:25.917 --> 10:28.002
just ‘cause he's got a bug
oal r =le=0

10:28.085 --> 10:29.188
- Calvin: Look out!
- (Horn beeps)

10:29.212 --> 10:30.379
Landlord coming through!

10:30.463 --> 10:32.548
Wealthy landlord coming through.

10:32.757 --> 10:33.883
That's a big hole, Bob.

10:33.966 --> 10:35.051
- What'd you do?
- What?

10:35.134 --> 10:37.136
| agree.
This is in no way

10:37.220 --> 10:38.679
caused by old
and leaky outflow pipes

10:38.846 --> 10:40.115
that the landlord
of this property

10:40.139 --> 10:41.325
should have replaced years ago.

10:41.349 --> 10:42.350
Good point, sir.

10:42.433 --> 10:43.476
Is this important?

10:43.559 --> 10:44.811
Because, (clears throat)

10:44.894 --> 10:46.813
Calvin, we were right
in the middle of flyering

10:46.896 --> 10:48.439
for wonder wharf
and champumping.

10:48.564 --> 10:49.690
How long do you think I relg

10:49.774 --> 10:50.900
to fill in, Mr. Fischoeder?

10:51.067 --> 10:53.110
Well, let's see,
what year is it now?

10:53.277 --> 10:54.987
- Oh, my god.
- He's kidding. (Chuckles)

10:55.071 --> 10:57.073
- You're kidding, right?
- Yes. Let's say yes.

10:57.240 --> 10:58.592
[I'm putting you in charge
o] R I rceine

10:58.616 --> 10:59.718
you're my ne'er-do-well brother

10:59.742 --> 11:00.827
who no one believes in,

11:00.910 --> 11:02.662
but maybe filling holes
is your thing.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.145
And you just need
a chance to shine.

11:04.288 --> 11:06.040
Grover,
I'm delegating this to you,

11:06.123 --> 11:07.458
since you're our something.

11:07.542 --> 11:09.460
- Lawyer. And cousin.
- Right. Ugh.

11:09.544 --> 11:11.170
Anyway, the city
will take care of this.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.923
- Probably done soon-ish?
- Or sooner!

11:14.090 --> 11:15.758
See, Bob?
Our hole's getting filled.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.385
- Gene: If | had a nickel...
- Gene.

11:17.468 --> 11:18.948
Shall we champump our way
out of here?

11:19.095 --> 11:20.888
Finish passing out (Ori

11:22.473 --> 11:23.558
(gulps)

11:23.641 --> 11:25.101
(Grunts, sighs)

11:25.184 --> 11:27.311
I'm exhausted. (Slurping)

11:27.395 --> 11:30.898
"Eighty years of cheap thrills
and almost no decapitations."

11:31.065 --> 11:32.733
Wow, that's such a low amount.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.360
| know. Can you believe it?

11:34.527 --> 11:36.112
She's lasted 80 years

11:36.195 --> 11:37.864
without getting sued
out of existence

11:37.947 --> 11:39.323
or collapsing into the sea.

11:39.407 --> 11:40.592
Louise: That's what
we say about dad.

11:40.616 --> 11:42.702
- Bob: Louise.
- My dad left all this to me,

11:42.785 --> 11:44.161
the pier, all these buildings.

11:44.245 --> 11:45.556
| still can't tell
if it was a joke.

11:45.580 --> 11:46.640
(Coughs) Should've been me.

11:46.664 --> 11:47.933
Oh, well,
that would've been funny.

11:47.957 --> 11:49.292
- Ha, true.
- (Felix mumbles)

11:49.417 --> 11:51.377
This says you're gonna
have live music

11:51.460 --> 11:54.297
at the "newly half renovated
bandshell."

11:54.463 --> 11:56.215
Yes. We've got
that accordion group,

11:56.299 --> 11:58.301
accordinary people.
Everybody loves them.

11:58.509 --> 11:59.802
We've got Johnny jazz hands.

11:59.886 --> 12:01.071
He does something with his hands

12:01.095 --> 12:02.763
- that | don't want to spoil.
- Thank you.

12:02.930 --> 12:05.016
And our band, the itty bitty
ditty committee!

12:05.099 --> 12:08.936
Ha! Oh. You're serious.
I'm gonna step away from you.

12:09.145 --> 12:11.230
All right, fellas.
Let's not be here anymore.

12:11.397 --> 12:14.609
Bye, burger people.
See you when the rent's due.

12:14.692 --> 12:16.569
(Scatting)
Put it in my mouth.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.237
- (Sighs) Rent.
- Oh, rent.

12:18.404 --> 12:19.864
Mr. Fischoeder.
We need your help!

12:19.947 --> 12:21.008
Calvin: Mm... mm-mm. Mm-mm.

12:21.032 --> 12:22.491
- No, yeah, yeah.
- Oh, my.

12:22.658 --> 12:25.286
The bank's being kinda cranky
about our business loan.

12:25.453 --> 12:28.080
S0, can we not pay you rent
for a little bit?

12:28.164 --> 12:29.332
S0 we can pay the bank?

12:29.498 --> 12:31.292
You want to not pay me rent?

12:31.375 --> 12:33.544
Am | understanding
your ridiculous question?

12:33.711 --> 12:34.837
Just for this month.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.464
Felix: Mmm-mm, mm-mm. Mm.

12:36.547 --> 12:37.548
Mm-mm. Mm.

12:37.632 --> 12:38.674
| agree with Felix.

12:38.841 --> 12:41.969
Well, | am of two minds,
and by that, | mean, drunk.

12:42.136 --> 12:44.430
- S0, I'm going to say maybe.
- Felidx: Hmm.

12:44.513 --> 12:46.307
Oh, hush.
Drive on!

12:46.390 --> 12:48.035
Felix and Calvin: (Singing)
We're driving on the sidewalk

12:48.059 --> 12:49.435
gl
-why "ha"?

12:49.518 --> 12:50.838
'‘Cause we don't
have to pay rent.

12:50.937 --> 12:52.188
That'll help us with the bank.

12:52.271 --> 12:53.272
He said, "maybe."

12:53.356 --> 12:54.756
Yeah, but he winked
when he said it.

12:54.815 --> 12:56.025
He's only got one eye.

12:56.108 --> 12:57.485
How do you know
it wasn't a blink?

12:57.652 --> 12:58.694
| can tell.

12:58.861 --> 13:00.404
S anl
-hi, Tina.

13:00.571 --> 13:02.323
This is cool. It's so deep.

13:02.490 --> 13:03.824
It's like at any moment

13:03.908 --> 13:05.618
the earth can just
swallow us up.

13:05.785 --> 13:06.786
Yeah...

13:06.953 --> 13:08.096
Andy: 'Cause it loves us
so much.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.098
Ollie: Mr. Belcher, do you
have a backup restaurant,

13:10.122 --> 13:11.791
in case the earth gets this one?

13:11.874 --> 13:13.167
Bob: Um, no.
Ollie: On.

13:13.250 --> 13:14.502
Louise, get away from the hole.

13:14.585 --> 13:15.785
Get away from the hole.
Please!

13:15.920 --> 13:18.047
All right, I'm going upstairs
to go to the bathroom,

13:18.214 --> 13:19.650
and they said
we won't be able to flush

13:19.674 --> 13:20.817
while they're fixing
the water pipe,

13:20.841 --> 13:22.218
so, last one to go,

13:22.385 --> 13:23.803
| hope you had your shots,

13:23.886 --> 13:25.113
[(o= (tsn <r o]Lglg o]
Get intense in there.

13:25.137 --> 13:26.897
Tina: | wanna go first.
Or at least not last.

13:27.098 --> 13:30.059
Gene: I wanna go last.
| wanna be the cherry on top!

13:30.142 --> 13:32.144
(Cheerful music playing)

13:46.075 --> 13:48.285
(Cheerful music continues)

14:00.756 --> 14:03.843
Stop staring at that hole,
hole and qoates. Come to bed!

14:04.051 --> 14:05.720
-No one came in today.
4t\

14:05.928 --> 14:06.929
and now we have six days

14:07.013 --> 14:08.055
- to pay the bank.
- Yep.

14:08.222 --> 14:09.390
(Sighs) And Mr. Fischoeder

14:09.473 --> 14:10.833
didn't call us back
about the rent.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.869
We still don't know
what kind of "maybe" that was.

14:12.893 --> 14:14.854
Ninety percent of "maybes”
are yeses.

14:15.021 --> 14:16.063
Definitely not true.

14:16.230 --> 14:18.524
We've said "maybe" to being
in Teddy's book club

14:18.607 --> 14:19.608
so many times.

14:19.775 --> 14:21.819
Well, they fixed the pipe,
that's good, right?

14:21.986 --> 14:23.529
And it's a pretty blue plastic.

14:23.612 --> 14:25.406
- S0 modern. We're hip now.
- Hmm.

14:25.489 --> 14:26.574
Hey, Mr. Mopey,

14:26.741 --> 14:28.593
what was that thing you told
me your mother used to say?

14:28.617 --> 14:30.619
| don't know.
"Something stinks in here"?

14:30.703 --> 14:32.747
No. It was like,
"hope and grit

14:32.830 --> 14:34.266
"keeps you out of
the you-know-what."

14:34.290 --> 14:35.750
Oh, yeah. She did say that.

14:35.833 --> 14:37.353
| think she thought
that was very edgy.

14:37.460 --> 14:39.045
- Well, it's true, too.
- Mm.

14:39.128 --> 14:40.129
Come on. Come to bed.

14:40.212 --> 14:42.173
Tomorrow, the hole
will get all filled up,

14:42.256 --> 14:43.549
and we'll sell
a million burgers.

14:43.758 --> 14:46.385
And you'll be able to make
facial expressions again, huh?

14:46.469 --> 14:47.553
-Happy.

14:47.636 --> 14:48.929
-Hopeful.

-kissy lips.

14:50.181 --> 14:51.182

14:51.348 --> 14:52.975
-Closed eyes, piggy nose!
S0

14:53.142 --> 14:54.643
- "| love Linda!"
- Mm.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.021
Aw, | love you too, Bobby!
Okay, bed!

14:57.521 --> 14:59.565
(Muffled)
Kids, lights out soon, okay?

14:59.732 --> 15:01.025
We're good parents.

15:01.192 --> 15:02.985
Tina: Tina rode Jericho
down the beach,

15:03.152 --> 15:05.404
Jimmy Jr. rode his horse,

Jericho: I'm running.
I'm running. I'm running.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.121
If you want to catch us

15:14.205 --> 15:15.873
you'll have to take off
lriv a= 1A st g

15:16.040 --> 15:17.291
to be more aerodynamic.

15:17.458 --> 15:18.643
Oh, you're doing it already.
Great!

15:18.667 --> 15:21.045
You're right. I'm faster when
I'm just wearing underwear.

15:21.212 --> 15:22.647
Tina: They galloped along
the endless sand,

15:22.671 --> 15:23.672
side by side.

15:23.756 --> 15:24.882
This is a perfect day.

15:24.965 --> 15:26.801
All my favorite stuff
in one place.

15:26.967 --> 15:29.053
You, my main horse, Jericho.

15:29.220 --> 15:30.860
If only there were...
Onh, there they are.

15:30.888 --> 15:32.014
Hi, sexy zombies.

15:32.181 --> 15:33.474
Zombies: Hi, tinal

15:33.891 --> 15:36.102
damn. Oh.
Hey, | have something for you.

15:36.268 --> 15:38.270
Oh, yeah?
Is that what | think it is?

15:38.437 --> 15:39.480
My barrette-clace.

15:39.563 --> 15:41.283
It's a combination
of barrette and necklace.

15:41.398 --> 15:42.399
Cool.

15:42.483 --> 15:43.734
Gosh, I'm so nervous.

15:43.901 --> 15:45.501
| shouldn't be nervous
in my own fantasy.

15:45.653 --> 15:46.779
This is a fantasy?

15:46.946 --> 15:48.632
Don't worry about that.
Forget | said anything.

15:48.656 --> 15:50.199
Uh, | was wondering
why | was so good

15:50.282 --> 15:52.034
- at horsetop riding.
- Horseback.

15:52.159 --> 15:53.160
- What?
- Nothing.

15:53.244 --> 15:54.537
Walit, let's stop. Let's stop.

15:54.703 --> 15:56.038
Whoa, whoa, Jericho.

15:56.122 --> 15:57.498
Jericho: (Whines)
| hate stopping.

15:57.665 --> 16:00.292
S0, why are you nervous
in your own fantasy?

16:00.459 --> 16:02.837
Is it because you're having
some doubts about real me,

16:02.920 --> 16:03.921
summer boyfriend-wise?

16:04.004 --> 16:05.005
Doubts, what?

16:05.089 --> 16:06.257
I'm sensing some doubts.

16:06.340 --> 16:07.883
Hey, how about
you have a fantasy

16:07.967 --> 16:09.569
and you can ask a lot
of questions in that, huh?

16:09.593 --> 16:11.262

16:22.022 --> 16:23.858
What's happening?
What's happening, right now?

16:24.024 --> 16:26.068
This is fun. We're having fun
on the friggin' beach.

16:26.235 --> 16:27.778
Son of a butt!

16:29.947 --> 16:32.074

- Mm-mm-mm! That sounds good.

Robot: Yeah, | think so.

if music is,

Chloe thinks that I'm scared
to not wear them.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.067
- Which is crazy.
- Totally.

18:30.150 --> 18:31.235

in your mouth. That's a rule.

23:49.136 --> 23:50.576
That's true
under the bleachers, too!

23:50.679 --> 23:51.680
Plus, look at it.

23:51.763 --> 23:53.932
Isn't it the weirdest shaped
tooth you've ever seen?

23:54.099 --> 23:55.601
Okay, maybe not too close.
(Gags)

23:55.684 --> 23:56.935
You can't handle the tooth!

23:57.102 --> 23:58.395
It was in my mouth, Tina!

23:58.562 --> 23:59.771
It's just, | think it's, like,

23:59.855 --> 24:01.648
against the law
for you to have that.

24:01.732 --> 24:03.052
Don't worry.
It's just a souvenir.

24:03.108 --> 24:04.484
I'll keep it to myself.

24:04.568 --> 24:05.569
Check it, people.

24:05.652 --> 24:07.279
- A dead man's tooth.
- (All gasp)

24:07.362 --> 24:08.822
And she's showing
the whole school.

24:08.989 --> 24:10.782
| went down
to the sinkhole at night,

24:10.866 --> 24:13.076
found a skeleton,
this tooth fell in my mouth.

24:13.160 --> 24:14.661
Did somebody say that's badass?

24:14.745 --> 24:16.371
Like the ultimate
dead man's drop?

24:16.455 --> 24:18.290
| mean, | guess,
maybe, | don't know.

24:18.457 --> 24:19.875
It was very dramatic,

24:19.958 --> 24:21.585
- [(and we got it all on tape.
Q)]S

24:21.668 --> 24:23.229
but we gotta get it
transferred to a format

24:23.253 --> 24:24.573
that anyone else
in the world has.

24:24.671 --> 24:26.173
| think my dad has
that kinda player.

24:26.340 --> 24:27.633
This just looks like that kind.

24:27.716 --> 24:28.717
[Q=x ilo] Ko4

24:28.800 --> 24:30.552
oh, my god, sn nn ir gl

24:30.636 --> 24:32.095
on a chain and gave it to you?

24:32.262 --> 24:33.639
So romantic.

24:33.805 --> 24:35.725
Yeah, we're gonna be
summer boyfriend-girlfriend.

24:35.766 --> 24:37.243
Jocelyn: Wait, but doesn't he,
like, need it?

24:37.267 --> 24:38.328
Tammy: What are you, a doctor?

24:38.352 --> 24:39.912
Jocelyn: | don't know.
Tammy: Where's your pager?

24:39.936 --> 24:42.147
Hmm, maybe this is a good time
to bring this baby out.

24:42.314 --> 24:44.191
Cafeteria,
pretty magical setting.

24:44.358 --> 24:47.277
Just gotta untangle it
a little bit,

24:47.444 --> 24:49.154
and then it's time
for that special moment.

24:49.237 --> 24:51.049
Jimmy Jr.: Hey, Zeke, throw
a chicken nugget in my mouth.

24:51.073 --> 24:52.074
Okay.

24:52.157 --> 24:53.450
Ow. Throw it again.

24:53.533 --> 24:54.701
Ow. Throw it again.

24:54.785 --> 24:55.845
God, he's still trying
(O nerz1(Eg)

24:55.869 --> 24:57.096
That chicken nugget
in his mouth.

24:57.120 --> 24:58.240
His whole eighth grade year.

24:58.288 --> 25:00.141
- Ow. Throw it again.
- Should we just not do this?

25:00.165 --> 25:01.333
No, | wanna be able to say

25:01.416 --> 25:02.685
| caught a chicken nugget
in my mouth.

25:02.709 --> 25:03.710
More than anything.

25:03.794 --> 25:05.234
Otherwise,
this has all been a waste.

25:05.379 --> 25:06.856
| see your point.
We'll get you there.

25:06.880 --> 25:10.384
(Sighs) Maybe now's not right.
He's got a lot going on.

25:10.550 --> 25:12.969
But still excited about this.
Whoo-hoo.

25:13.053 --> 25:15.389
And that's why I'm starting
my foundation, sinkhole kids.

25:15.555 --> 25:17.235
It's to help kids
who've been in sinkholes.

25:17.349 --> 25:19.142
It changes you.
Some people can't handle it.

25:19.309 --> 25:21.770
Fourth graders,
why are you not sitting down?

25:21.937 --> 25:22.938
Or are you sitting?

25:23.021 --> 25:24.541
It's hard to tell.
You're all so small.

25:24.690 --> 25:26.066
A5
-oh, Louise,

25:26.149 --> 25:27.335
| have been meaning to ask you,

25:27.359 --> 25:28.360
where'd you get your hat?

25:28.443 --> 25:30.043
| want to get one like that
for my niece.

25:30.112 --> 25:31.988
She's three
and she loves bunnies.

25:32.072 --> 25:33.552
- (Chloe giggling)
- Back off, labonz.

25:33.615 --> 25:35.033
What? I'm trying
to cheer her up.

25:35.117 --> 25:36.993
Potty training's not going well.

25:37.077 --> 25:39.413
- (Louise grunts)
- It's nasty.

25:40.205 --> 25:41.206
Oh, hello, Louise.

25:41.289 --> 25:42.958
Did you have a nice,
nutritious meal?

25:43.041 --> 25:44.167
-(Louise growls)
_(Gasps)

25:46.294 --> 25:48.422
Stupid Chloe barbash,
laughing. I'll laugh at her.

25:48.505 --> 25:49.625
She's not gonna laugh at me.

25:49.673 --> 25:50.674
- What?
- Nothing.

25:50.757 --> 25:53.260
Okay, uh, call me back.
Thank you. Bye.

25:53.427 --> 25:55.512
S0, how many times is it okay

25:55.595 --> 25:57.198
to call your landlord
and leave a message?

25:57.222 --> 25:58.473
Depends.
Does he like-like you?

25:58.640 --> 26:00.100
| still can't believe
we were livin'

26:00.183 --> 26:01.601
above a dead body
this whole time.

26:01.768 --> 26:02.811
| couldn't even tell.

26:02.894 --> 26:04.187
| wonder who the skeleton was.

26:04.354 --> 26:06.022
George Washington?

26:06.189 --> 26:08.191
| can't think
of any other dead people.

26:08.358 --> 26:10.986
Well, whoever it was,
they were murdered to death,

26:11.153 --> 26:13.780
then buried to death
by a murderer-burier.

26:13.947 --> 26:15.532
And a scorpio, probably.

26:15.615 --> 26:16.843
I'm gonna call him
one more time.

26:16.867 --> 26:18.994
- (All protesting)
- Easy, Bob, easy.

26:19.161 --> 26:20.370
Lin, we have to pay the bank.

26:20.537 --> 26:21.788
You shout that a lot now.

26:21.955 --> 26:23.075
We only have four days left.

26:23.123 --> 26:24.267
There's no way we can pay rent

26:24.291 --> 26:25.601
and come up
with the bank's money.

26:25.625 --> 26:26.728
We haven't sold any burgers.

26:26.752 --> 26:27.812
Teddy's had a lot of burgers.

26:27.836 --> 26:29.156
Right. We haven't sold
any burgers

26:29.212 --> 26:30.213
to someone besides Teddy.

26:30.297 --> 26:32.275
Oh, my god. Look it. They're
talking about our hole.

26:32.299 --> 26:33.300
The skeleton discovered

26:33.383 --> 26:35.051
earlier this morning
under ocean Avenue

26:35.135 --> 26:36.136
has been identified

26:36.219 --> 26:38.180
as missing wonder wharf
employee, Daniel Deangelo,

26:38.346 --> 26:41.224
widely known to park customers
as coftton candy Dan.

26:41.391 --> 26:42.392
Cotton candy Dan?

26:42.476 --> 26:43.619
Is that the guy
who sold corndogs?

26:43.643 --> 26:44.644
Mom, shush.

26:44.728 --> 26:46.128
Police sources tell
channel six news

26:46.188 --> 26:48.982
that a suspect is being taken
into custody tonight.

26:49.065 --> 26:51.401
A-ha! There you go.
They have a suspect.

26:51.568 --> 26:54.196
Now they'll UN-crime scene
our hole and fill it in.

26:54.279 --> 26:56.239
And Mr. Fischoeder
will call us back too,

26:56.406 --> 26:58.050
and he'll tell us
we can slide on the rent,

26:58.074 --> 26:59.367
and we'll be on easy street.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.495
Ir (is
had a big hole in it, huh?

27:01.578 --> 27:03.079
(Sighs) Maybe you're right.

27:03.163 --> 27:04.443
Sorry. Sorry,
| was freaking out.

27:04.498 --> 27:05.499
Sorry, everybody.

27:05.582 --> 27:07.393
Something's just come in.
This is breaking news.

27:07.417 --> 27:09.252
Wonder wharf owner,
Calvin fischoeder,

27:09.336 --> 27:10.462
has been arrested

27:10.629 --> 27:11.880
and charged with the murder

27:11.963 --> 27:13.799
- of cotton candy Dan.
- (All gasp)

27:13.882 --> 27:15.175
- What the...
- Oh, my god.

27:15.258 --> 27:16.259
Okay, that's not good.

27:16.343 --> 27:17.445
We now go live
to police headquarters.

27:17.469 --> 27:18.613
Reporter: Mr. Fischoeder,
do you have

27:18.637 --> 27:19.781
any comments for us
at this time?

27:19.805 --> 27:21.097
| haven't killed any carnies.

27:21.264 --> 27:22.742
There. | think that clears
everything up.

27:22.766 --> 27:23.975
| refer all further questions

27:24.142 --> 27:25.268
to my personal attorney

27:25.352 --> 27:26.788
and personal cousin,
grover fischoeder.

27:26.812 --> 27:28.688
My client is innocent
and we're gonna prove it.

27:28.772 --> 27:30.565
Yeah, sure,
a bullet from my brother's gun

27:30.649 --> 27:32.335
- was found in the guy's body.
- Uh... (Chuckles nervously)

27:32.359 --> 27:33.795
Felix: And sure, a lot of
people heard him yelling,

27:33.819 --> 27:34.879
(nn [o)] Om (ol (/| bl o=1l=)

27:34.903 --> 27:35.963
"And I'm going to Bury your body

27:35.987 --> 27:37.267
"where no one can find it."
Sure.

27:37.322 --> 27:38.591
- Grover: Uh... yeah.
- But who among us

27:38.615 --> 27:39.991
hasn't said those exact words

27:40.075 --> 27:42.075
while gambling with carnies
on a stormy night, huh?

27:42.202 --> 27:44.204
Uh, no one.
We've all said those words.

27:44.663 --> 27:47.541
(Sighs) Maybe we'll be
his one phone call?

27:47.624 --> 27:48.625
Oh, the weather.

27:48.708 --> 27:50.028
(Forecaster speaking
indistinctly)

27:52.546 --> 27:54.798
Teddy: Hey, wharfiversary
stuff's still going on.

27:54.965 --> 27:56.716
| heard they're doing
half-priced rides

27:56.800 --> 27:57.884
and free popcorn.

27:57.968 --> 27:59.469
Yeah, kinda busy out there.

27:59.553 --> 28:01.763
Teddy: Hmm, people do not seem
to mind going to a park

28:01.847 --> 28:02.848
owned by a murderer.

28:02.931 --> 28:04.571
Linda: If only we could get
to the people.

28:04.641 --> 28:06.434
Why can't restaurants
move around, you know?

28:06.601 --> 28:08.144
- Just hop over the hole.
- Huh.

28:08.228 --> 28:09.622
Why can't buildings
have little legs?

28:09.646 --> 28:10.689
That'd be cute. Yeanh.

28:10.856 --> 28:11.898
Or motors, and wheels?

28:11.982 --> 28:12.983
That's cars.

28:13.066 --> 28:14.192
Oh, yeah. That's cars.

28:14.276 --> 28:17.070
(Drawling) Oh, god.

28:17.487 --> 28:20.198
Oh, no.

28:20.866 --> 28:22.826
- Oh, boy.
- Is dad okay?

28:22.993 --> 28:24.870
Oh, no.

28:25.495 --> 28:27.831
-Oh, no, no, no.
Shin s

28:28.498 --> 28:30.083
dad, | don't wanna stop
your flow,

28:30.166 --> 28:31.835
but can you pass the pilaf?

28:31.918 --> 28:33.712
- Oh, god.
- That's butter.

28:33.795 --> 28:35.130
You know what? Butter's better.

28:35.213 --> 28:38.216
(Continues drawling) Oh, no.

28:38.300 --> 28:39.968
How you doin' there, big guy?

28:40.051 --> 28:41.052
(Sighs) | don't know.

28:41.136 --> 28:42.176
| mean, | held it together

28:42.220 --> 28:43.322
in front of the kids
during dinner,

28:43.346 --> 28:44.389
but I'm really worried.

28:44.556 --> 28:45.849
Oh, yeah? | couldn't tell.

28:45.932 --> 28:48.226
It's just our landlord's
gonna go to prison.

28:48.310 --> 28:49.769
The bank's gonna
call in our loan,

28:49.853 --> 28:51.497
and then they'll take
our restaurant stuff,

28:51.521 --> 28:53.398
and we will live in a box
on the street.

28:53.481 --> 28:54.542
This is what's gonna happen.

28:54.566 --> 28:56.985
Oh, Bob, | need you.
The kids need you.

28:57.152 --> 28:58.713
What do you mean?
You and the kids need me

28:58.737 --> 28:59.821
to not go out of business.

28:59.988 --> 29:02.741
No. Going out of business
down there is not as bad

29:02.908 --> 29:04.576
as going out of business
in there.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.161
My soft pec?

29:06.328 --> 29:07.370
No, your heart.

29:07.454 --> 29:09.456
Look, | know
you're droopy Bob right now.

29:09.623 --> 29:11.583
But you know who else
is in there? Dreamy Bob.

29:11.750 --> 29:12.935
The guy who wanted to open
a restaurant

29:12.959 --> 29:14.002
in the first place,

29:14.085 --> 29:15.253
slap his name on it

29:15.420 --> 29:18.256
make cuckoo crazy burgers
with wild ingredients.

29:18.423 --> 29:19.549
A new one every day.

29:19.716 --> 29:21.468
| did not say
"cuckoo crazy" burgers.

29:21.551 --> 29:22.552
| would not say that.

29:22.636 --> 29:24.276
You know what | mean.
Super funky burgers.

29:24.304 --> 29:25.972
Well, no matter what | said,

29:26.056 --> 29:28.099
| think that maybe
dreamy Bob is dumb

29:28.266 --> 29:30.685
and droopy Bob just kinda
sees things the way they are.

29:30.852 --> 29:32.371
You know what you gotta do
to droopy Bob?

29:32.395 --> 29:33.396
9l my o p\ g

29:33.480 --> 29:34.749
you gotta punch him
in the nuts, like this.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.274
- Ow!
- Sorry, sorry, sorry

29:36.358 --> 29:38.336
but you know what I'm saying.
It's like a metaphor.

29:38.360 --> 29:39.527
- Like this.
- Ow!

29:39.611 --> 29:41.988
Stop! It's not a metaphor
if you actually do it.

29:42.072 --> 29:43.073
Yes, it is.

29:43.156 --> 29:44.574
I'm going to sleep.
Good night.

29:44.741 --> 29:45.867
And, hey, who knows,

29:45.951 --> 29:47.577
maybe Mr. Fischoeder
is innocent.

29:47.661 --> 29:49.663
He gets out, we put that wink
in the bank.

29:49.746 --> 29:52.248
| don't know if he's innocent,
but he is going to prison.

29:52.415 --> 29:53.750
Well, at least
the other prisoners

29:53.833 --> 29:55.085
will like his eyepatch.

29:55.251 --> 29:56.451
That's a good look for prison.

29:56.503 --> 29:58.588
You know, conversation starter.

29:58.672 --> 30:01.049
(Dramatic music playing)

30:05.512 --> 30:07.514
Bye, kids. Have fun at school.

30:07.681 --> 30:10.016
Gene, | hope we do okay
on that math homework.

30:10.183 --> 30:12.185
| was really wingin' it. Four.

30:12.268 --> 30:14.145
| hope so too. Good guess.

30:15.230 --> 30:16.231
(Gene and Tina yelp)

30:16.481 --> 30:17.774
All right.
Emergency kid meeting.

30:17.941 --> 30:19.025
What? Now? Here?

30:19.109 --> 30:20.110
Yeah, we gotta talk.

30:20.276 --> 30:22.112
Outdoor, before schoal,
emergency kid meeting?

30:22.195 --> 30:23.381
Is this about
whatever's going on

30:23.405 --> 30:24.507
with Tina's bangs right now?

30:24.531 --> 30:26.008
I've been wanting to fix them
all morning.

30:26.032 --> 30:27.392
- Wait, what?
- Louise: No, listen.

30:27.534 --> 30:29.054
| heard mom and dad
talking last night.

30:29.202 --> 30:30.620
The restaurant
is in big trouble.

30:30.787 --> 30:32.789
- Boy trouble? Girl trouble?
- All the trouble.

30:32.956 --> 30:34.541
Mr. Fischoeder
can't go to prison.

30:34.624 --> 30:36.376
If he does,
mom and dad won't be able

30:36.459 --> 30:38.169
to pay the bank,
and then that's it.

30:38.336 --> 30:39.379
No more restaurant.

30:39.546 --> 30:41.232
And what are we gonna do
with mom and dad after school

30:41.256 --> 30:42.456
if there's no more restaurant?

30:42.507 --> 30:43.776
- Huh.
- Sign them up for sports?

30:43.800 --> 30:44.843
But the good news is,

30:44.926 --> 30:47.303
| think Mr. Fischoeder
is innocent.

30:47.470 --> 30:49.681
Innocent? But what about
how guilty he is?

30:49.764 --> 30:51.808
Well, why was he so relaxed
about that hole?

30:51.891 --> 30:54.269
If you had buried a guy
in that exact spot,

30:54.352 --> 30:56.855
wouldn't you be a little more
anxious to fill it in?

30:57.022 --> 30:58.857
Or at least go sneak
that sucker out of there

30:58.940 --> 31:00.140
and stick them somewhere else?

31:00.191 --> 31:02.110
Like how you re-hide
your journal every night?

31:02.277 --> 31:03.403
No, | don't.

31:03.570 --> 31:04.654
S0, here's the plan.

31:04.738 --> 31:05.780
We need to skip school...

31:05.864 --> 31:06.865
- No.
- Yes.

31:06.948 --> 31:08.950
We need to gather evidence,
talk to witnhesses.

31:09.034 --> 31:10.035
We need to start now.

31:10.118 --> 31:11.220
But, Louise, if you don't think

31:11.244 --> 31:12.704
Mr. Fischoeder did it,
who did?

31:12.871 --> 31:13.872
Here's what I'm thinking.

31:13.955 --> 31:15.915
This was actually a beef
between two carnies.

31:16.082 --> 31:17.500
- Beef con carnie.
- Louise: Mm-hmm.

31:17.584 --> 31:19.103
You get your hands
on fischoeder's gun,

31:19.127 --> 31:20.962
you settle your score
with cotton candy Dan,

31:21.046 --> 31:22.231
you just got away with murder.

31:22.255 --> 31:23.715
So, what do we do
with that theory?

31:23.798 --> 31:25.216
Turn it into a graphic novel.

31:25.383 --> 31:27.177
Louise: No, we go talk
to our old pal Mickey.

31:27.343 --> 31:28.344
He's a carnie now.

31:28.428 --> 31:30.055
He probably knows
I rn i[N e [o ]| o b

31:30.221 --> 31:31.701
and | brought all the gear
we'll need.

31:31.806 --> 31:33.308
Snacks, gum, night light.

31:33.475 --> 31:34.517
Oh, snacks. I'm in.

31:34.684 --> 31:36.404
- Night light?
- Yeah. In case it gets dark.

31:36.436 --> 31:38.289
| thought we were doing this
during school time.

31:38.313 --> 31:39.707
| don't know
why | mentioned the light.

31:39.731 --> 31:41.441
Let's just get our bikes,
shall we?

31:41.524 --> 31:44.194
(Sighs) Fine. | did forget
to do a bunch of homework.

31:44.360 --> 31:46.613
Great. So, we have to get past
the back door

31:46.696 --> 31:47.896
without mom and dad seeing us.

31:48.031 --> 31:50.617
Stay low, follow my lead.
Try to look like alley trash.

31:50.784 --> 31:52.285
Gene: Or raccoon poop.

31:52.368 --> 31:54.370
(Jazzy music playing)

32:00.502 --> 32:01.729
(Whispers)
We did that really well.

32:01.753 --> 32:03.296
All right.
Save Mr. Fischoeder,

32:03.379 --> 32:04.923
save the restaurant,
solve a murder.

32:05.090 --> 32:06.925
On three. One, two, three.

32:07.008 --> 32:08.093
All: Save Mr. Fischoeder,

32:08.176 --> 32:09.445
save the restaurant,
solve a murder.

32:09.469 --> 32:11.238
And prove we're not babies,
and Chloe barbash is dumb.

32:11.262 --> 32:12.430
Okay, let's move.

32:12.597 --> 32:15.391
This is how law and order
should start. Every time.

32:17.268 --> 32:18.708
Louise: Hi,
we're looking for Mickey.

32:18.853 --> 32:20.081
- Mickey?
- Louise: Yeah. Mickey.

32:20.105 --> 32:22.524
Brown hair, used to Rob banks,
nice guy. Works here now.

32:22.690 --> 32:24.734
No, | know Mickey.
He owes me three seventy-five.

32:25.401 --> 32:27.112
- Dollars?
- And seventy-five.

32:27.779 --> 32:28.863
- Cents?
- Yeah, cents.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.257
Louise: Where is he working
today? Scream-i-cane?

32:30.281 --> 32:31.574
Ah, he's off till second shift.

32:31.658 --> 32:32.718
Do you know where he lives?

32:32.742 --> 32:35.023
We could probably remind him
about the three seventy-five?

32:35.161 --> 32:36.621
He lives in carniapolis.

32:36.704 --> 32:38.264
Most of the carnies
live in carniapolis.

32:38.331 --> 32:39.332
That makes sense.

32:39.415 --> 32:40.667
Where is carniapolis?

32:40.750 --> 32:41.852
Hang a left
at the old dog food building.

32:41.876 --> 32:42.877
But don't go there.

32:42.961 --> 32:44.355
- Don't go there?
- The dog food building?

32:44.379 --> 32:45.499
Yeah, down past the stadium.

32:45.547 --> 32:47.733
You'll smell it, then go left.
But seriously, don't go there.

32:47.757 --> 32:49.610
Uh, is there a reason you keep
saying, "don't go there"?

32:49.634 --> 32:50.986
- Because you shouldn't.
- Okey dokey.

32:51.010 --> 32:53.179
Just wanted to clarify,
but, um, why should we...

32:53.263 --> 32:54.514
Hi, is the park open?

32:54.681 --> 32:56.867
No, I'm just here '‘cause
I'm trapped inside this booth.

32:56.891 --> 32:59.477
Yes, we're open.
All rides half off today.

32:59.644 --> 33:00.812
The only crime would be

33:00.895 --> 33:02.939
to not take advantage
of these prices.

33:04.107 --> 33:06.234
Okay, new sign.
| think this is the one.

33:06.401 --> 33:08.945
- "We have a 'hole' new look."
- Bob: Mm.

33:09.028 --> 33:10.446
"Come on in through the alley.

33:10.530 --> 33:12.907
"It's not weird.
Love, Linda and Bob."

33:13.074 --> 33:14.701
Bob: | guess
that's professional.

33:14.868 --> 33:17.078
"P.s., alley smells like pee,
restaurant is fine."

33:17.162 --> 33:18.329
(Man shouts indistinctly)

33:18.413 --> 33:19.706
Oh, Bob. Dirt.

33:19.873 --> 33:21.166
- Bob: Dirt?
- Dirt.

33:21.249 --> 33:22.667
Bob: (Grunts) I'm getting up.

33:23.543 --> 33:25.545
Onh, dirt. They're gonna
fill in the hole.

33:25.712 --> 33:27.463
Linda: Yeah. Look at them.

33:28.923 --> 33:30.258
Linda: (Gasps) Uh...

33:30.800 --> 33:32.760
- Where are they going?
- Bob: They are leaving.

33:32.844 --> 33:33.988
Linda: And they're
leaving the dirt?

33:34.012 --> 33:35.212
Bob: They are
leaving the dirt.

33:35.305 --> 33:37.724
Do we put it in ourselves, or...

33:37.891 --> 33:39.517
They probably have
someone else coming.

33:39.601 --> 33:41.477
- A dirt installer?
- Mm.

33:41.561 --> 33:43.313
It's nice.
It's like a little mountain.

33:43.479 --> 33:45.690
| don't like it. | think
it should be in the hole.

33:45.773 --> 33:48.818
- Linda: Mm.
- Bob. Linda. Come. Come see.

33:50.528 --> 33:53.781
(Imitates fanfare) | call it
the mobile Bob burger mobile.

33:53.865 --> 33:55.658
S0, you can sell burgers
in the street.

33:55.825 --> 33:57.785
You could go anywhere.
Hot street meat.

33:57.952 --> 34:00.580
It's my grill from home,
but | upgraded the wheels,

34:00.663 --> 34:02.790
and | put these bars on it
so you can move it.

34:02.874 --> 34:04.852
- Linda: Oh, wow. Uh-huh.
- It's got a cooler for drinks.

34:04.876 --> 34:06.103
-Got a little umbrella here.
Yo\l

34:06.127 --> 34:07.962
you got a place to keep buns
and toppings.

34:08.129 --> 34:10.005
| figure, you grill,
Linda serves,

34:10.089 --> 34:11.317
and I'll push it around for you.

34:11.341 --> 34:13.551
So, I'll be there
the whole time with you guys,

34:13.717 --> 34:15.011
keeping the banter going,

34:15.094 --> 34:16.679
being part of
each other's lives.

34:16.846 --> 34:18.431
You know, laughing,
loving, learning.

34:18.514 --> 34:19.514
Teddy, Teddy, Teddy.

34:19.599 --> 34:21.976
It's so nice of you
to do this. But we...

34:22.060 --> 34:24.103
We don't have a license
to sell food on the street.

34:24.187 --> 34:25.188
We could get fined.

34:25.271 --> 34:26.438
(Chuckles) Nah.

34:26.522 --> 34:27.750
I'll keep an eye out
for the cops.

34:27.774 --> 34:28.918
- | don't think we can...
- Linda: | love it.

34:28.942 --> 34:30.342
- Wait, what'd you say?
- L love it.

34:30.400 --> 34:31.879
Right? You can't get
the people to your burgers,

34:31.902 --> 34:33.196
you bring the burgers to them.

34:33.279 --> 34:35.239
[(Sllc1a )r r{Ci=trite]
We're just skipping over

34:35.322 --> 34:36.759
my "we don't have a license"
comment.

34:36.783 --> 34:39.202
Oh, come on, Bob.
It's not a law, right?

34:39.369 --> 34:40.721
It's like I'm supposed
to wear a hairnet

34:40.745 --> 34:42.425
when | work in the kitchen,
but | never do.

34:42.496 --> 34:44.217
That's a law. Also a law.
They're both laws.

34:44.248 --> 34:45.250
Bob, we have to sell

34:45.333 --> 34:46.560
- some burgers today, right?
- Yes.

34:46.583 --> 34:47.895
Linda: We got four days
to pay the bank.

34:47.918 --> 34:49.629
- That's true.
- Come on.

34:49.795 --> 34:51.630
[Okay, fine. But only because
y gcren] Ei d

34:51.714 --> 34:52.715
this place can't close.

34:52.799 --> 34:54.275
| can't live
if livin' is without you.

34:54.300 --> 34:56.052
-Teddy. | said we could do it.
S0l melelele

34:56.135 --> 34:57.720
let's light this sucker up, huh?

34:57.887 --> 34:59.430
- You got it.
- (All yelp)

34:59.514 --> 35:00.765
No problem. No problem.

35:00.932 --> 35:02.267
Just gotta check the gas line.

35:02.350 --> 35:04.203
Might have had it up
a little bit high. (Chuckles)

35:04.227 --> 35:06.187
You guys meet me back here
with some ground beef,

35:06.354 --> 35:07.434
and some comfortable shoes,

35:07.563 --> 35:09.023
and maybe an apron for me

35:09.107 --> 35:10.251
so we all kinda have a uniform.

35:10.275 --> 35:11.567
Oh, that gives me an idea.

35:11.651 --> 35:13.379
Bob, | gotta go up
to the apartment real quick.

35:13.403 --> 35:15.089
- Be right back.
- Okay, Bob, grab your meat.

35:15.113 --> 35:16.173
Please don't shout that at me.

35:16.197 --> 35:17.757
Right, right.
(Whispers) Grab your meat.

35:18.533 --> 35:21.786
Smells like the most stuff
you can grind up to make food.

35:21.869 --> 35:23.496
Tina: Oh, look,
that was their slogan.

35:23.579 --> 35:24.580
Gene: Huh.

35:25.915 --> 35:28.084
Tina: This doesn't look right.
No one lives here.

35:28.251 --> 35:30.128
Gene: | don't know why.
It's beautiful.

35:30.211 --> 35:31.337
(Indistinct yelling)

35:31.421 --> 35:32.672
Louise: Whoa, you hear that?

35:32.755 --> 35:34.424
Tina: Huh. They sound cranky.

35:34.590 --> 35:36.151
Louise: Let's check it out.
Tina: Oh, okay.

35:36.175 --> 35:37.218
| miss school.

35:37.302 --> 35:39.721
I'm feeling suddenly
like | love fractions.

35:39.887 --> 35:41.806
Tina: Yeah, | wanna learn
about photosynthesis

35:41.889 --> 35:43.308
so badly right now.

35:44.434 --> 35:45.727
If this is carniapolis,

35:45.893 --> 35:46.933
maybe we shouldn't disturb

35:46.978 --> 35:49.230
their scary sounding
carnie time?

35:49.397 --> 35:51.816
N leeta I =r (al
they're deciding who to shiv

35:51.983 --> 35:54.295
and if they see us, they'll be
like, "oh, let's shiv them."

35:54.319 --> 35:56.446
But you know, maybe not.

35:56.904 --> 35:58.906
(Indistinct yelling continues)

35:58.990 --> 36:01.200
(Ominous music plays)

36:03.036 --> 36:05.371
Tina: Are they playing a game
with duckies?

36:05.538 --> 36:06.664
Gene: Adorably?

36:06.831 --> 36:09.000
Lucky ducky. Lucky ducky.
Damn.

36:09.167 --> 36:10.543
- Kids.
- Hi, Mickey.

36:10.626 --> 36:11.669
How's it going?

36:11.753 --> 36:13.272
You here to buy drugs?
You don't buy drugs.

36:13.296 --> 36:14.672
| can't even swallow pills.

36:14.839 --> 36:16.066
We have to hide them
in his food.

36:16.090 --> 36:18.885
We, uh, wanted to ask you
some questions.

36:19.052 --> 36:20.053
Mickey, your turn.

36:20.219 --> 36:21.304
Oh. Can you skip me?

36:21.471 --> 36:23.681
We play lucky ducks,
but we play carnie rules.

36:23.848 --> 36:24.891
Tina: Seems fun.

36:25.058 --> 36:26.809
There's more beer and yelling

36:26.893 --> 36:28.644
than when kids play it
at wonder wharf.

36:28.811 --> 36:30.772
Yeah, well, we're toasting
cotton candy Dan.

36:30.938 --> 36:32.357
That's why we're also gambling

36:32.523 --> 36:35.151
and pushing each other
and punching each other.

36:35.318 --> 36:37.278
The first shift folks
made a nice little memorial

36:37.445 --> 36:38.946
to put on the pier
in his old spot.

36:39.113 --> 36:42.325
And us second shift folks
are, uh, doing this.

36:42.408 --> 36:43.409
Uh-huh.

36:43.493 --> 36:44.720
-(Whispers) Just ask him.
Mov sis yr

36:44.744 --> 36:45.787
but pretty soon, right?

36:45.870 --> 36:47.139
Give me a second.
| can't just say,

36:47.163 --> 36:49.665
"hey, Mickey, which carnie
killed cotton candy Dan?"

36:49.749 --> 36:50.750
Wait, did you say,

36:50.833 --> 36:52.668
"which carnie killed
cotton candy Dan?"

36:53.586 --> 36:55.296
(Laughs awkwardly)

36:55.380 --> 36:57.020
Louise: It did sound
like that, didn't it?

36:57.131 --> 36:58.758
You come in to carniapolis

36:58.925 --> 37:01.386
and accuse a carnie
of killing another carnie?

37:01.469 --> 37:02.696
| think that's right.
Is that right?

37:02.720 --> 37:03.971
You know, it's bad enough

37:04.055 --> 37:05.455
that Mr. Fischoeder
kills one of us,

37:05.598 --> 37:07.642
which is bad boss alert,
am | right?

37:07.725 --> 37:09.977
- Yeah.
- But to throw it back on us?

37:10.186 --> 37:11.729
Hey, hey, they're just kids.

37:11.896 --> 37:14.565
Kid cops. Little kid cops.
They have those, you know?

37:14.732 --> 37:17.151
For going into small spaces
and hiding in boxes.

37:17.235 --> 37:18.403
Nah, | know these guys.

37:18.569 --> 37:20.381
They're not cops.
They're little burger babies.

37:20.405 --> 37:22.281
- (Louise growls)
- Maybe don't use that word.

37:22.365 --> 37:24.033
What? "Burger"? Sorry.
Meat patties?

37:24.117 --> 37:25.243
It's just too much.

37:25.410 --> 37:27.829
First fischoeder kills
cotton candy Dan, now this?

37:27.995 --> 37:29.705

37:29.789 --> 37:31.707
stabbing a heart
going up into his skull

37:31.874 --> 37:34.419

37:45.513 --> 37:47.515

-well, most of us.

37:47.598 --> 37:48.975
And our misdemeanors

now we sell fried dough

kinda sketchy gals and fellas

38:03.072 --> 38:04.699
One day you're cleaning vomit

38:04.782 --> 38:07.076
next you're on a missing poster

38:07.243 --> 38:09.120
it's such a drag

38:09.287 --> 38:11.080
to have a boss

38:11.247 --> 38:13.374
-who pays you bad
-who pays us bad

Tina: Have a nice day.

39:47.051 --> 39:48.219
See, they're not cops.

39:48.386 --> 39:50.555
Cops don't dance around
like that.

39:50.638 --> 39:52.557
They dance like this.
(Gruntys)

39:52.974 --> 39:54.976
Louise: (Scoffs)
More like carni-crapolis.

39:55.059 --> 39:56.060

39:56.143 --> 39:57.788
| think I'm gonna have
my next birthday party there.

39:57.812 --> 39:58.813
Tina: Oh, good idea.

39:58.896 --> 40:00.606
Yeah, the theme's gonna be
"disgruntled."

40:00.690 --> 40:01.732
That's nice.

40:07.822 --> 40:09.490
Um... am | being paranoid,

40:09.574 --> 40:11.742
or is that big scary carnie
following us?

40:11.826 --> 40:13.119
(Gasps)
Maybe he just remembered

40:13.202 --> 40:14.453
that he forgot to murder us.

40:14.620 --> 40:16.205
- Oh, god.
- Quick, this way.

40:16.289 --> 40:18.249
(All panting)

40:20.209 --> 40:21.210

40:21.294 --> 40:22.670

than split ends.

40:22.753 --> 40:24.153
Uh, Tina,
why'd you say go this way?

40:24.213 --> 40:25.631
-Tina: | didn't.
_(All scream)

40:25.715 --> 40:28.134
(Gasps) Oh, sorry.
Didn't mean to scare you.

40:28.301 --> 40:29.343
No, no, of course not.

40:29.427 --> 40:30.886
Just following kids into alleys.

40:30.970 --> 40:33.014
Everybody loves that.
(Chuckles nervously)

40:33.097 --> 40:34.849
Is there something
we can do for you?

40:35.016 --> 40:37.560
You were asking who wanted
to kill cotton candy Dan?

40:37.727 --> 40:38.853
No, | mean, before.

40:38.936 --> 40:40.187
But not anymore.
We've moved on.

40:40.354 --> 40:41.772
| got something to tell you.

40:41.856 --> 40:43.232
| didn't wanna say it
back there.

40:43.399 --> 40:44.918
They don't wanna hear
what | gotta say.

40:44.942 --> 40:45.943
We're listening.

40:46.027 --> 40:47.337
[(But maybe not making
)Y (=yele]G]R=te 8

40:47.361 --> 40:48.821
| was there that night,
you know?

40:48.904 --> 40:50.406
The last night anyone saw Dan.

40:50.573 --> 40:51.574
- You were?
- Yeah.

40:51.741 --> 40:53.576
We were playing lucky ducky
on the wharf.

40:53.743 --> 40:55.411
And sure,
Dan and Mr. Fischoeder

40:55.494 --> 40:56.495
got into a big fight.

40:56.662 --> 40:59.040
Mr. Fischoeder started
throwing ducks at Dan's head.

40:59.206 --> 41:01.042
He kept yelling "duck,"
and it was confusing.

41:01.208 --> 41:02.251
| can see that.

41:02.418 --> 41:03.729
Anyway, after the game,
| went back

41:03.753 --> 41:05.004
‘cause | forgot my stress ball.

41:05.171 --> 41:07.381
And it's just Dan,
Mr. Fischoeder,

41:07.465 --> 41:08.674
and Felix fischoeder,

41:08.841 --> 41:10.343
and they're yelling
at each other,

41:10.426 --> 41:11.886
(ello r ulv acr1) Throwing ducks.

41:12.053 --> 41:13.471
Wait. Felix was at the game?

41:13.638 --> 41:14.722
Vom a rv 1m e

41:14.889 --> 41:17.016
Mr. Fischoeder doesn't let him
play lucky ducky

41:17.183 --> 41:18.684
because Felix gives
all the duckies

41:18.768 --> 41:20.269
different voices
and personalities

41:20.436 --> 41:21.596
and it makes it take a while.

41:21.729 --> 41:23.809
That's why it was weird
that he showed up that night.

41:23.939 --> 41:25.483
But nobody back there
wants to hear

41:25.566 --> 41:27.109
that maybe Mr. Fischoeder
didn't do it.

41:27.276 --> 41:29.070
Oh, my god. Of course.

41:29.236 --> 41:31.530
Felix fischoeder.
It's so Felix.

41:31.697 --> 41:33.616
He has access
to Mr. Fischoeder's gun.

41:33.783 --> 41:35.409
He was fighting
with both Mr. Fischoeder

41:35.493 --> 41:36.535
and cotton candy Dan.

41:36.702 --> 41:39.413
And most importantly,
he has a motive.

41:39.497 --> 41:41.666
He has a motive
to frame his brother.

41:41.832 --> 41:42.958
Because he's mad

41:43.042 --> 41:45.294
Mr. Fischoeder doesn't like
his lucky ducky voices?

41:45.461 --> 41:46.504
No, because | bet you

41:46.587 --> 41:49.131
if Mr. Fischoeder goes
to jail, Felix gets his money.

41:49.340 --> 41:50.466
We gotta go to the cops.

41:50.549 --> 41:53.135
Oh. Uh, mind if | don't go
to the cops?

41:53.302 --> 41:55.096
| have to pick up
my dry cleaning,

41:55.179 --> 41:56.222
because it's dry now.

41:56.389 --> 41:57.532
- Louise: Yeah, no problem.
- Okay.

41:57.556 --> 41:58.700
Louise: Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

41:58.724 --> 42:00.484
Gene: Thank you, scary carnie.
Love you. Bye.

42:00.518 --> 42:01.518
Carnie: Bye.

42:02.603 --> 42:04.123
Teddy: Well,
everything fits perfectly.

42:04.188 --> 42:05.231
What's this for?

42:05.314 --> 42:06.315
- Olive bar.
- What?

42:06.440 --> 42:07.876
| thought you could have
imported olives,

42:07.900 --> 42:08.984
and they could go there.

42:09.151 --> 42:11.088
- Oh. I'm not sure...
- While you wait for a burger,

42:11.112 --> 42:12.506
you help yourself
to an imported olive.

42:12.530 --> 42:13.531
Okay.

42:13.614 --> 42:15.133
| got these on my way over.
You can pay me later.

42:15.157 --> 42:16.534
- Mm.
- Mobile Bob burger mobile

42:16.617 --> 42:18.497
is a little fancier
than restaurant Bob burgers.

42:18.536 --> 42:19.537
You'll get used to it.

42:19.620 --> 42:21.181
Where's Linda? | feel like
she's missing all the fun

42:21.205 --> 42:23.082
of us setting up
this cart together.

42:23.249 --> 42:24.291
Ta-dal

42:24.458 --> 42:25.793
- what's happening?
- L get it.

42:25.876 --> 42:26.956
No questions from this guy.

42:27.086 --> 42:28.246
I'm the marketing department.

42:28.337 --> 42:29.588
| took gene's burger suit,

42:29.672 --> 42:31.298
let out the crotch
a little bit, and bam.

42:31.465 --> 42:33.592
I'll push the product,
while you push the cart.

42:33.759 --> 42:35.219
- But the bikini.
- It's summer.

42:35.386 --> 42:37.471
- And sex sells, baby.
- Yeah, Bob.

42:37.638 --> 42:39.849
Is that sex?
A burger with a bikini on it?

42:39.932 --> 42:41.012
- Uh, yeah.
- Linda: Mm-hmm.

42:41.726 --> 42:42.768
Okay, let's do it.

42:42.852 --> 42:43.936
-Yay.
Sallnqle[pld

42:44.103 --> 42:45.855
- | dreamt this.
- Oh. No, don't tell us.

42:45.938 --> 42:46.939
No, it was nice.

42:47.022 --> 42:48.917
Linda wasn't in it. It was
just a burger in a bikini.

42:48.941 --> 42:50.043
Bob: Yeah,
still don't tell us.

42:50.067 --> 42:53.070
Teddy: I'm so happy right now.
Let's go save your restaurant!

42:57.116 --> 42:58.218
- Sergeant bosco.
- (Splutters)

42:58.242 --> 43:00.002
- Holy smokes, you scared me.
- Sorry. Sorry.

43:00.077 --> 43:01.203
Don't sneak up on a cop.

43:01.370 --> 43:03.038
That's our job.
We sneak up on you.

43:03.122 --> 43:04.123
Why are you here?

43:04.206 --> 43:06.709
We went to the police station,
where you live, | assume.

43:06.876 --> 43:08.627
But nobody from homicide
would talk to us.

43:08.711 --> 43:10.147
So, then we went to look
for you in robbery,

43:10.171 --> 43:11.398
but they said
you were on a stakeout.

43:11.422 --> 43:13.299
And they told you where | was?

43:13.466 --> 43:14.759
They said you were
at a dangerous

43:14.842 --> 43:15.885
biker gang headquarters,

43:15.968 --> 43:17.195
and we said,
"the one eyed snakes"?

43:17.219 --> 43:18.304
And they said, "yeah,"

43:18.387 --> 43:19.489
and we said,
"oh, we know those guys."

43:19.513 --> 43:20.574
And they were like, "what?"

43:20.598 --> 43:21.867
And we were like,
"yeah, they're really nice."

43:21.891 --> 43:22.951
Get down, get down.
(Shushing)

43:22.975 --> 43:24.327
Gene: You get down.
Tina: (Whispers) Gene.

43:24.351 --> 43:26.604
Gene: (Whispering) Sorry.
We are also getting down.

43:26.771 --> 43:28.272
What are we looking for?

43:28.355 --> 43:29.356
(Whispers) Bikers.

43:29.440 --> 43:30.483
Right. But, doing what?

43:30.566 --> 43:33.569
We got a tip that they stole
a bunch of karaoke machines,

43:33.736 --> 43:35.881
and I'm watching to see if
they try and move the goods.

43:35.905 --> 43:37.823
That doesn't seem like
their kind of crime.

43:37.907 --> 43:39.009
Critter: (Singing)
Come on, shake your body

43:39.033 --> 43:40.034
baby, do the conga

43:40.117 --> 43:41.917
you know you can't control
yourself any longer

43:43.788 --> 43:45.182
- oh, okay.
- Sergeant bosco: Mm-hmm.

43:45.206 --> 43:46.916
Anyway, we're here to tell you

43:46.999 --> 43:48.584
that the police
have the wrong guy.

43:48.751 --> 43:50.961
Mr. Fischoeder didn't kill
cotton candy Dan.

43:51.128 --> 43:52.505
His brother, Felix, did.

43:52.671 --> 43:54.631
Wait, aren't you kids supposed
to be in that place

43:54.757 --> 43:56.926
with the books and
adults that tell you stuff?

43:57.092 --> 43:58.260
- Adult bookstore?
- No.

43:58.344 --> 43:59.428
- School?
- Yeah. School.

43:59.595 --> 44:00.947
Some of us think
we are supposed to be

44:00.971 --> 44:02.056
in school right now. Yes.

44:02.139 --> 44:03.724
Tina, the restaurant, remember?

44:03.891 --> 44:04.951
If Mr. Fischoeder
goes to jail,

44:04.975 --> 44:06.018
the restaurant goes under.

44:06.101 --> 44:07.102
Down under.

44:07.186 --> 44:09.188
Where the didgeridoo
whatever they're gonna do.

44:09.271 --> 44:10.397
(Grunts) Get out.

44:10.481 --> 44:12.066
Get out of my unmarked
stakeout vehicle.

44:12.233 --> 44:14.276
Go catch tadpoles
or whatever kids do.

44:14.443 --> 44:16.153
- Go catch tadpoles?
- Yeah.

44:16.320 --> 44:17.530
- Tadpoles?
- Yeah.

44:17.613 --> 44:18.893
The things that turn into frogs.

44:18.948 --> 44:20.199
We know what they are.

44:20.366 --> 44:21.846
| was pretty sure.
Not bad to clarify.

44:21.951 --> 44:24.119
- We're city folk.
- Oh, | see.

44:24.203 --> 44:25.597
- You're just robbery.
- Sergeant bosco: Mm.

44:25.621 --> 44:27.181
You couldn't help
even if you wanted to.

44:27.206 --> 44:28.249
Because it's a homicide.

44:28.415 --> 44:30.376
You don't know anything
about that case, do you?

44:30.543 --> 44:32.294
(Lo a (01 | know all the stuff.

44:32.461 --> 44:33.629
Name one stuff.

44:33.796 --> 44:35.464
| know something
that's not in the papers.

44:35.548 --> 44:37.216
-(Scoffs) Yeanh, right.
S [e)

44:37.383 --> 44:39.635
They found a cufflink
in the hole, near the body.

44:39.802 --> 44:41.846
- Yeah?
- A very unique cufflink.

44:42.012 --> 44:44.598
Custom. It's a banana
wearing a graduation hat.

44:44.682 --> 44:46.600
- Hmm, classy.
- Carnies don't wear cufflinks.

44:46.767 --> 44:47.935
True. Lotta tank tops.

44:48.102 --> 44:49.329
| know carnies
don't wear cufflinks.

44:49.353 --> 44:50.633
They searched
fischoeder's house,

44:50.688 --> 44:51.748
but they haven't found
the other one.

44:51.772 --> 44:52.773
- Huh.
- Yeah.

44:52.857 --> 44:54.525
But | bet they didn't
search Felix's.

44:54.692 --> 44:56.837
We need to go to Felix's place
and look for that cufflink.

44:56.861 --> 44:57.862
Go, go, go.

44:57.945 --> 44:59.047
Hate it. Terrible plan.
Don't like it.

44:59.071 --> 45:00.391
Oh, good.
Looks like you're taking

45:00.447 --> 45:02.533
your annoying conversation
somewhere else. Bye.

45:02.700 --> 45:04.261
Sergeant bosco,
you know you left the light

45:04.285 --> 45:05.369
on the top of your car.

45:05.452 --> 45:07.663
Huh? What?
Oh, damn it. Son of a...

45:07.746 --> 45:08.932
Argh. Okay.
At least no one saw.

45:08.956 --> 45:09.957
They don't know I'm here.

45:10.040 --> 45:11.417
Get away. Get away.
Shoo. Shoo.

45:11.500 --> 45:12.668
Hey, kids.
Hey, Louise.

45:12.751 --> 45:14.062
- Louise: Hey, critter.
- You bothering

45:14.086 --> 45:15.379
- that nice policeman?
- No.

45:15.462 --> 45:16.857
I'm not a policeman.
What are you...

45:16.881 --> 45:18.007
Son of a...
Dang nab.

45:18.299 --> 45:20.259
Oh, my bad. You're just
a regular guy. I'm sorry.

45:20.426 --> 45:21.677
Your badge is on the dashboard.

45:21.760 --> 45:22.761
Can they see that?

45:22.845 --> 45:24.531
And your coffee says
"sergeant bosco" on it.

45:24.555 --> 45:25.556
All right, get away.

45:25.848 --> 45:27.975
Fresh hot burgers.
Sexy burgers.

45:28.058 --> 45:29.226
- Bob: Lin.
- What?

45:29.310 --> 45:30.495
(Singing)
You wanna eat a burger

45:30.519 --> 45:32.187
does she look like
a weird streetwalker?

45:32.271 --> 45:33.272
Not too much.

45:33.355 --> 45:34.635
- How's the burger?
- It's great.

45:34.773 --> 45:36.150
I've never eaten outside before.

45:36.317 --> 45:37.443
-Wait, what?
Rv

45:37.610 --> 45:39.194
-are you selling burgers?
Rv -1

45:39.361 --> 45:40.404
I'll take a cheeseburger.

45:40.487 --> 45:41.923
What was it?
What made you want a burger?

45:41.947 --> 45:43.073
| was hungry.

45:43.240 --> 45:45.326
- And then you saw a...
- Cart.

45:45.492 --> 45:47.328
And a person dressed as a...

45:47.494 --> 45:48.746
She's not with us. Shoo, shoo.

45:48.829 --> 45:49.872
Oh, Bob.

45:49.955 --> 45:53.083
Fresh hot burgers.
Sexy burgers. Fresh hot...

45:53.918 --> 45:55.544
(Gasps) Bob, it's Hugo.

45:55.711 --> 45:56.980
Teddy:
Hugo the health inspector?

45:57.004 --> 45:59.124
Oh, god. They know we don't
have a license to do this.

45:59.214 --> 46:00.799
Um, did you mean for me
to hear that?

46:00.883 --> 46:01.884
Shh! Crouch down.

46:01.967 --> 46:03.844
Okay, but | feel
a little weird about it.

46:04.011 --> 46:05.679
It's just quite a coincidence,
that's all.

46:05.846 --> 46:07.490
| start using chapstick,
and then, all of a sudden,

46:07.514 --> 46:08.557
you start using chapstick?

46:08.641 --> 46:09.910
Why can't you just be flattered?

46:09.934 --> 46:11.435
- Oh, fine, use it.
- Oh, thank god.

46:11.602 --> 46:12.913
(Whispering)
They're gonna see us.

46:12.937 --> 46:15.356
Let's hide in wonder wharf.
Teddy, let's move.

46:15.522 --> 46:16.649
I'm still eating my burger.

46:16.732 --> 46:17.733
Do | go, too?

46:17.816 --> 46:18.943
Yes, stay low.

46:21.236 --> 46:22.321
Are you coming, Ron?

46:22.488 --> 46:24.406
Sorry, putting on my chapstick.

46:24.490 --> 46:25.491
Hugo: Hmm.

46:28.452 --> 46:29.453
Hmm.

46:29.828 --> 46:32.039
(Jazzy music playing)

46:36.001 --> 46:37.336
(Whispers) Treehouse. Go.

46:37.419 --> 46:38.671
(Grunting)

46:41.048 --> 46:42.549
(Panting)

46:50.182 --> 46:51.433
Hmm. Hmm.

46:51.976 --> 46:53.268
Heaven?
Sounds like heaven.

46:53.435 --> 46:55.104
| think she's saying
we're number one.

46:55.270 --> 46:57.773
But we're
"not all there, upstairs."

46:57.940 --> 46:59.775
Oh, my god. I'm saying
let's go up the ladder

46:59.942 --> 47:01.860
and listen for Felix,
and see if he's in there.

47:02.027 --> 47:03.747
- Oh, that makes more sense.
- Tina: Mm-hmm.

47:05.948 --> 47:07.574
(In adult-like voice)
Felix fischoeder?

47:07.741 --> 47:11.996
That treehouse hot tub
you ordered is here.

47:12.871 --> 47:13.932
(In normal voice)
Okay, he's not home.

47:13.956 --> 47:14.957
Oh, god.

47:15.040 --> 47:17.042
People, we are looking
for a banana cufflink.

47:17.209 --> 47:18.836
An educated banana cufflink.

47:19.003 --> 47:20.355
Also, we might be
in @ murderer's house,

47:20.379 --> 47:21.380
iveie-lal a4}

47:21.547 --> 47:23.632
yep, yep. If he comes home,
you fight him.

47:23.716 --> 47:25.092
Tina: Uh...

47:25.175 --> 47:27.845
(Dog carnie grunting
rhythmically)

47:27.928 --> 47:29.179
Dog carnie: Oh. Oonh.

47:29.263 --> 47:31.890
Bob: Okay, uh,
do we go back out now?

47:32.057 --> 47:33.100
See if the coast is clear?

47:33.267 --> 47:36.145
Or do we stay here?
Sell these folks some burgers?

47:36.228 --> 47:37.271
Um, | mean...

47:37.438 --> 47:39.440
What? Let them throw up
our food on the rides.

47:39.523 --> 47:40.524
Hey, look.

47:40.607 --> 47:42.407
Bob burgers is getting
a little bit of a line.

47:42.526 --> 47:44.361
Linda: No.
We are not Bob burgers.

47:44.445 --> 47:45.863
\we work here now.

47:45.946 --> 47:46.947
(Grunts) At the wharf.

47:47.031 --> 47:48.115
| mean, we don't.

47:48.198 --> 47:49.918
But, | guess we could stay
for a little bit.

47:50.075 --> 47:51.535
Also, we were never Bob burgers.

47:51.702 --> 47:53.078
Hello, ma'am. Sir.

47:53.245 --> 47:54.413
You can order anything

47:54.496 --> 47:57.082
from the top-third of
the front of the menu there,

47:57.249 --> 48:00.252
and anything from the left
side of the middle section

48:00.335 --> 48:01.336
on the back of the menu.

48:01.420 --> 48:02.546
And you are welcome

48:02.629 --> 48:04.339
to an imported olive
while you wait.

48:04.506 --> 48:06.067
Can | get the toothpick back
when you're done?

48:06.091 --> 48:07.134
Bob's looking at me funny.

48:07.301 --> 48:08.927
Never mind.
That is yours to keep.

48:09.303 --> 48:10.488
(Sighs) | don't think it's here.

48:10.512 --> 48:11.513
We looked everywhere.

48:11.597 --> 48:12.598
It's definitely not

48:18.771 --> 48:19.831
Felix: (Muffled)
Yeah, | just got home.

48:19.855 --> 48:21.295
(Gasps) Crap, he's home.
Quick, hide.

48:21.815 --> 48:23.067
Felix: Are you at your house?

48:23.150 --> 48:25.277
(Tina whimpering)

48:26.987 --> 48:28.739
(Whispering)
We all did a terrible job.

48:28.906 --> 48:30.657
Gene, you're just standing
against the wall.

48:30.824 --> 48:32.304
(Whispering)
Where he'd least suspect.

48:32.451 --> 48:33.911
Crap.
Everybody into the closet.

48:34.703 --> 48:35.764
Felix:
I'm just going upstairs.

48:35.788 --> 48:37.182
Gonna get some stuff
out of the closet.

48:37.206 --> 48:38.566
(Srr etin o)
- Crap. Everybody out.

48:39.208 --> 48:40.209
What about there?

48:40.292 --> 48:41.710
Louise: Yes, quick.
Go, go, go.

48:44.630 --> 48:45.631
This is lovely.

48:45.714 --> 48:47.091
- Shh!

48:47.174 --> 48:49.093

- No, I'm sleepy.

48:54.389 --> 48:56.725
(Whispers) Is that Fanny?
| thought she was in jail.

48:56.892 --> 48:59.012

trying to make it work.

49:05.109 --> 49:07.045
Fleeing the country
is a once in a lifetime thing.

We deserve
to look good doing it.

49:09.071 --> 49:11.448
| don't wanna flee
the country. It's too far.

49:11.615 --> 49:12.616
Oh, wait, that's cute.

49:12.783 --> 49:14.143
Yay. Okay.
What are you gonna wear?

49:14.243 --> 49:15.386
A hat that looks like shorts,

49:15.410 --> 49:16.690
and shorts that look like a hat.

49:16.787 --> 49:18.080
- Okay.

All right,
I'll meet you at the place.

(Singing) Fleeing the country,
fleeing the country

49:23.877 --> 49:25.629
fleeing the country

49:25.796 --> 49:28.215
Felix and Fanny
framed fischoeder,

49:28.298 --> 49:30.134
and now they're fleeing
the freaking country.

49:30.300 --> 49:31.510
| can't believe it.

49:31.593 --> 49:33.053
Mm, little stuffy in here.

climb down from here.

49:43.605 --> 49:44.648
Tina, you go first.

49:44.731 --> 49:46.650
What?
Oh, god.

49:46.733 --> 49:48.277

Gene: Mm.

to put your dirty dishes.

Bri tn g1
he is a murderer. Maybe.

50:06.378 --> 50:07.754
Yeah, murderers probably leave

50:07.838 --> 50:09.173
their dishes all over the place.

50:09.339 --> 50:10.883
Gene, try that door.

50:13.844 --> 50:14.845

50:14.928 --> 50:16.555
Gene, what did you do?

50:16.847 --> 50:18.140
| don't know. (Whimpers)

50:18.223 --> 50:20.934
This is gonna help me
with childbirth later in life.

50:21.727 --> 50:22.936
(Grunts) Thank you.

50:23.103 --> 50:25.939
Okay, | have some questions
about this moving balcony.

50:26.106 --> 50:27.816
Louise: | think it's how
he gets his meals

50:27.900 --> 50:28.940
and sends back his dishes.

50:28.984 --> 50:30.444
Gene: Oh, then | love it.
(Gasps)

50:31.236 --> 50:33.697
Suitcase, suitcase,
you're gonna fly.

50:33.864 --> 50:35.024
Oh, my god.
He's gonna see us.

50:38.035 --> 50:39.036
(Gasps)

50:39.703 --> 50:41.622
(All straining quietly)

50:44.166 --> 50:46.793
What am | forgetting?
Have my mints.

50:46.960 --> 50:49.129
Packed my sleeping shorts.

50:49.213 --> 50:51.256
(Clicking tongue)
Ah, I'm good.

50:51.965 --> 50:53.008
My wet wipes.

50:53.717 --> 50:55.677
Ah, | can hire a wet wiper
when | get there.

50:55.761 --> 50:56.762
Louise: Oh, thank god.

50:56.929 --> 50:58.656
But he's gonna get away.
We gotta follow him.

50:58.680 --> 50:59.720
Nope. Doesn't sound right.

50:59.765 --> 51:00.766
Gene, back me up on this.

51:00.849 --> 51:02.267
You can hire a wet wiper?

51:04.770 --> 51:05.771
(All grunt)

51:05.854 --> 51:06.855
I'm okay.

51:06.939 --> 51:08.398
All right.
We'll follow him,

51:08.565 --> 51:10.210
and call the police
when we see what his plan is.

51:10.234 --> 51:11.652
Gene: | want
a moving dish balcony.

51:12.236 --> 51:14.571
Here you go. Totally normal
wonder wharf burger.

51:14.738 --> 51:15.781
We've sold a lot of food.

51:15.948 --> 51:17.115
Teddy, this cart is perfect.

51:17.199 --> 51:19.034
| mean, not perfect,
but it's great.

51:19.117 --> 51:21.912
(Sniffling) No big deal.
Just helping out a friend.

51:22.079 --> 51:23.879
But, maybe we should
move around a little bit.

51:23.997 --> 51:25.457
So we don't get caught
doing this.

51:25.624 --> 51:27.751
We're not gonna get caught.
Bob, we fit right in.

51:27.918 --> 51:29.461
A family just took
a picture with me.

51:29.544 --> 51:30.545
No, | saw that.

51:30.629 --> 51:32.881
A family was surprised when
you jumped in their picture.

51:32.965 --> 51:33.966
A lucky family.

51:34.049 --> 51:35.276
Please, can we move to be safe?

51:35.300 --> 51:36.580
- On, fine.
- Teddy: Let's do it.

51:36.677 --> 51:37.917
We're moving locations, people.

51:37.970 --> 51:39.513
- Lin, shh.
- Oh, Bob. Relax.

51:39.680 --> 51:41.241
- Everything's going great.

51:41.265 --> 51:43.058
- What was that?
- Back it up. Back it up.

51:43.225 --> 51:46.478
It's some cotton candy,
and a picture, and a candle...

51:46.561 --> 51:49.564
(Gasps) It's a little shrine
for cotton candy Dan.

51:49.731 --> 51:51.066
So0l g [o}
-Uh, it's fine.

51:51.149 --> 51:52.835
I'm gonna put it
all back together over here.

51:52.859 --> 51:54.820
Okay, that's broken.
Oh. Oops.

51:54.903 --> 51:56.154
That's not gonna stand up.

51:56.321 --> 51:57.739
It's all right.
Nobody saw, right?

51:57.906 --> 51:59.408
- What the...
- Linda: Oh, boy.

51:59.491 --> 52:00.492
Teddy: Uh-onh.

52:00.575 --> 52:01.928
- Bob: Oh, crap.
- Are you kidding me?

52:01.952 --> 52:03.996
Well, why was it
on the ground like that?

52:04.162 --> 52:05.706
'Cause that was his spot.

52:05.872 --> 52:07.374
Okay, yeanh.
That's a good reason.

52:07.541 --> 52:09.876
We worked really hard
on that memorial. Kinda.

52:10.043 --> 52:11.295
Also, who are you?

52:11.378 --> 52:12.421
Nobody.

52:12.504 --> 52:14.006
Is that guy
picking up a lead pipe?

52:14.172 --> 52:15.382
Onh, it's a hotdog. Still.

52:15.549 --> 52:17.801
Bob: We should maybe
leave the park.

52:17.968 --> 52:20.113
We can't get to the exit.
We'd have to get through him.

52:20.137 --> 52:22.055
Oh, my god.
Okay, uh, new idea.

52:22.222 --> 52:24.558
Linda, Teddy, I ts sv

52:24.725 --> 52:26.351
Linda: Yep. Yep.
We're running.

52:26.935 --> 52:29.104
Felix: Excuse me. Whoopsie.
Pa-pa-pap-pap-pap.

52:29.187 --> 52:31.398
Louise: Why is Felix
going into wonder wharf

52:31.481 --> 52:32.625
if he wants to flee the country?

52:32.649 --> 52:34.651
Is wonder wharf
in international waters?

52:34.818 --> 52:36.903
Maybe he wants to win
a goldfish real quick.

52:37.070 --> 52:38.363
No bikes on the pier.

52:38.447 --> 52:39.487
Louise: Yeah, no, we know.

52:39.531 --> 52:40.532
We're friends now though,

52:40.615 --> 52:42.200
so, it's okay, right?
Yeah, thank you.

52:42.367 --> 52:43.647
| know that Felix is a murderer,

52:43.744 --> 52:45.579
but it's kinda sweet
that he and Fanny

52:45.662 --> 52:47.015
are gonna flee
the country together.

52:47.039 --> 52:48.999
It's a real he-fled,
she-fled situation.

52:49.166 --> 52:51.126
What? Tina, get your head
outta your boobs.

52:51.293 --> 52:52.336
Right. Right.

52:53.462 --> 52:55.297
(Sentimental music plays)

52:56.089 --> 52:57.090
- Hey, Tina...
- (Gasps)

52:57.174 --> 52:58.234
you're not really thinking

52:58.258 --> 52:59.760
about Felix and Fanny, are you?

52:59.926 --> 53:01.606
Fantasy Jimmy Jr.,
what are you doing here?

53:01.720 --> 53:04.348
You're thinking about me.
You're thinking about this.

53:04.431 --> 53:07.434
Boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

53:07.517 --> 53:08.643
Holy crap.

53:08.727 --> 53:10.062
Phew!
| don't have time for this.

53:10.228 --> 53:11.897
But that question
you wanna ask me.

53:12.064 --> 53:13.464
You're not nervous
that I'll say no.

53:13.523 --> 53:15.150
You're nervous
that I'll say yes.

53:15.317 --> 53:16.777
And that real me

53:16.860 --> 53:19.529
is just never gonna be
as good as fantasy me.

53:19.696 --> 53:21.782
- Dang it, Jimmy Jr., not now.
- (Yelps)

53:21.865 --> 53:23.545
- Oh, sorry.
- Fantasy Jimmy Jr.: I'm okay.

53:23.575 --> 53:24.785
Tina, focus.

53:24.951 --> 53:26.370
Yep. Coming. Here | am.

53:26.453 --> 53:28.205
Lo om h o1 El g g ei 1

53:29.748 --> 53:30.874
there's the bandshell.

53:31.041 --> 53:33.919
See ya soon, Shelly.
We're gonna rock so hard.

53:34.086 --> 53:35.420
Lot of confidence here,

53:35.504 --> 53:37.506
despite what some robots
may say.

53:37.672 --> 53:38.757
- Tina: What?
- Nothing.

53:39.466 --> 53:40.592
Look, the golf cart.

53:40.759 --> 53:42.552
And he's parked
in front of the funhouse

53:42.636 --> 53:43.637
like a true criminal.

53:43.804 --> 53:45.044
Well, what's he doing in there?

53:45.138 --> 53:47.349
(Singing) A lovely bunch
of sailors dancing in a row

53:47.432 --> 53:48.433
| knew | looked good.

53:48.975 --> 53:49.976
Louise: Get down.

53:54.731 --> 53:57.359
Felix: Beep-beep, ba-boop,
ba-beep. Thank you.

53:57.526 --> 53:59.111
(V[ Ar (v1 a"are v1 1aya

53:59.486 --> 54:01.863
(all panting)

54:04.032 --> 54:05.242
Felix: And...

54:06.201 --> 54:07.828
Oh. Parked.

54:07.911 --> 54:09.246
(Humming)

54:09.329 --> 54:10.330
(Grunts)

54:11.748 --> 54:13.291
Louise: The molehill? Ugh.

54:13.375 --> 54:14.376
| like the molenhill.

54:14.543 --> 54:16.020
It's the ride they recommend
for grandparents

54:16.044 --> 54:17.271
and people with heart problems.

54:17.295 --> 54:18.296
| go on it with dad.

54:18.964 --> 54:20.298
Both: Whee.

54:22.676 --> 54:23.716
What's happening in there?

54:23.844 --> 54:25.762
- Moles got him, probably.
- Come on.

54:28.181 --> 54:30.725
Tina: (Grunts)
Stupid kickstand. Wait up.

54:33.186 --> 54:34.229
| don't hear anything.

54:34.312 --> 54:35.712
Lavlst I vya
"do not enter," so |...

54:35.772 --> 54:36.773
Oh, you're going in.

54:37.482 --> 54:38.567
\what the...

54:40.152 --> 54:41.319
Where the hell did he go?

54:41.403 --> 54:42.529
Ooh, buttons.

54:42.612 --> 54:43.892
You know what | like to do wi r4

54:43.989 --> 54:46.450
gene, no. Jeez, good thing
you didn't push that one.

54:46.533 --> 54:48.535
- Mm! Hello, lover.
- Tina: No, no, no, no, no.

54:48.618 --> 54:51.788
-(Button clicks)
_(All screaming)

54:55.792 --> 54:56.877
Gene: Wow.

54:57.544 --> 55:00.255
(Sighs) | think we lost them.
| think we're good.

55:00.338 --> 55:02.132
Sheesh, you knock over
one memorial.

55:02.299 --> 55:04.050
Well, it was a nice thing
that they made

55:04.134 --> 55:05.403
for their friend
who was murdered.

55:05.427 --> 55:07.387
And we were pretending
that we work here,

55:07.471 --> 55:08.865
and | guess,
taking money from them.

55:08.889 --> 55:10.182
And | look like a giant burger,

55:10.307 --> 55:11.367
and you know,
maybe they're hungry.

55:11.391 --> 55:12.869
Carnie: There they are.
Bob: Oh, for Pete's sake.

55:12.893 --> 55:13.933
Teddy: Go, go, go, go, go.

55:14.060 --> 55:15.246
Bob: Yep.
Linda: Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

55:15.270 --> 55:17.230
| have an idea. You guys
go left at the corner.

55:17.397 --> 55:18.749
I'll take the cart
and go straight ahead.

55:18.773 --> 55:20.168
- They'll follow the cart.
- Bob: | don't think

55:20.192 --> 55:21.461
- that's gonna work.
- Good idea, Teddy. Thank you.

55:21.485 --> 55:22.765
Teddy: Take care of Linda
for me.

55:22.819 --> 55:24.029
Turn here, turn here.

55:24.112 --> 55:25.906
-Bob: Uh... all right.
(Teddy yells)

55:25.989 --> 55:27.675
- (Dog carnie grunts)
- Onh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

55:27.699 --> 55:28.867
Should we chase those guys?

55:28.950 --> 55:30.928
-Dog carnie: Yeah.
N odo 0t l=xe a mo e =n ao 11 xe 11 b

55:30.952 --> 55:32.078
Bob: Didn't work.

55:32.704 --> 55:34.080
What is this place?

55:34.247 --> 55:36.041
Tina: Did we go through
a time warp?

55:36.208 --> 55:37.375
Gene: | bet we quantum leapt.

55:37.459 --> 55:38.627
Where did Felix go?

55:38.710 --> 55:40.813
Also, how do we get outta here
if he tries to kkill...

55:40.837 --> 55:41.838
-Children?
Srr

55:41.922 --> 55:44.025
ew, what are you doing here?
Did you hear me go pee-pee?

55:44.049 --> 55:45.967
- Kids: Uh...
- Calvin: Children? Ew.

55:46.134 --> 55:47.260
Louise: Mr. Fischoeder.

55:47.344 --> 55:48.821
What are you doing
in our secret clubhouse?

55:48.845 --> 55:51.014
What are you doing
in your secret clubhouse?

55:51.181 --> 55:52.261
| thought you were in jall.

55:52.390 --> 55:53.934
- | posted ball.
- Jail bail.

55:54.100 --> 55:56.144
Yep, had to. Those beds
were bad for my back.

55:56.311 --> 55:57.479
How'd you get in here?

55:57.646 --> 55:58.748
You were running around up there

55:58.772 --> 55:59.957
pressing buttons, weren't you?

55:59.981 --> 56:01.525
Of course, we were.
They're buttons.

56:01.691 --> 56:02.931
You pressed the ouchies button?

56:02.984 --> 56:04.212
Weren't you worried
about ouchies?

56:04.236 --> 56:05.445
- Eh.
- Okay, well,

56:05.529 --> 56:06.696
you can leave now. Bye.

56:06.863 --> 56:10.033
Calvin and | have
some business things to do.

56:10.116 --> 56:11.826
Mm. You have
tr =t tl

56:11.910 --> 56:13.387
this is why | think
you should grow a beard.

56:13.411 --> 56:14.412
You know | can't!

56:14.579 --> 56:17.207
Sorry, can you give us a sec?
We just need to hug.

56:17.374 --> 56:18.875
- We love each other.
- Gross.

56:18.959 --> 56:20.269
(Whispers) Guys, we gotta
tell Mr. Fischoeder

56:20.293 --> 56:21.354
that his brother framed him,

56:21.378 --> 56:22.438
and then get him out of here

56:22.462 --> 56:23.982
before Felix does
something bad to him.

56:24.089 --> 56:25.090
Tina: This feels nice.

56:25.173 --> 56:26.526
Yeah, we should do this
more often.

56:26.550 --> 56:28.385
Okay, yeah, but save
the restaurant, remember?

56:28.552 --> 56:30.095
Great hug.
Now, Mr. Fischoeder,

56:30.178 --> 56:31.680
can we talk to you over here?

56:31.846 --> 56:32.847
Calvin: | don't hug.

56:32.931 --> 56:34.200
Gene: Ooh, what's this thing?
Louise: Gene!

56:34.224 --> 56:35.684
Oh, yes, my sweet old organ.

56:35.767 --> 56:37.227
- Gene: Your wiener?
- (Calvin scats)

56:37.310 --> 56:38.710
Calvin: That is
the orchestramarama.

56:38.770 --> 56:40.230
Gene: | love that.

56:40.313 --> 56:42.041
- Interesting. Can |, uh...
- It is interesting.

56:42.065 --> 56:43.459
This used to be
part of the old park.

56:43.483 --> 56:44.544
- (Louise groans)
- This place was

56:44.568 --> 56:45.735
the orchestramaramatorium.

56:45.902 --> 56:48.238
And it was the launch point
for our underwater ride,

56:48.405 --> 56:50.907
Poseidon's sea-cret,
spelled s-e-a,

56:50.991 --> 56:52.071
which I'm just now getting.

56:52.242 --> 56:54.077
Oh, yeah. (Grunts softly)

56:54.160 --> 56:55.787
You see, when our father
bought the pier,

56:55.954 --> 56:58.123
he built wonder wharf
on top of the old park,

56:58.206 --> 56:59.749
and he hid this room away.

56:59.916 --> 57:01.835
Sealed it up under the molehill.

57:01.918 --> 57:04.045
- (Music chiming)
- And ha-cha.

57:04.129 --> 57:05.297
Gene: Oonh.
Tina: Whoa.

57:05.380 --> 57:06.840
Calvin: Mm,
the sea monsters win.

57:07.007 --> 57:08.341
Those look like dolphins.

57:08.508 --> 57:10.677
Well, dolphins were considered
monsters back then.

57:10.844 --> 57:11.904
- Mr. Fischoeder...
- Gene: Quick question.

57:11.928 --> 57:13.197
- Yes, boy Bob child.
- (Louise sighs)

57:13.221 --> 57:14.865
Could our band borrow this
when we headline

57:14.889 --> 57:16.529
at the wonder wharf bandshell
this summer?

57:16.683 --> 57:18.143
| assume it's easy to move.

57:18.310 --> 57:19.495
Follow-up question,
don't you think

57:19.519 --> 57:20.788
that now that
we're borrowing this,

57:20.812 --> 57:22.582
we should headline
at the bandshell this summer?

57:22.606 --> 57:23.607
Ha! You're dreaming.

57:23.690 --> 57:25.066
Johnny jazz hands
is the headliner.

57:25.233 --> 57:26.901
Gene, stop getting distracted.

57:27.068 --> 57:28.988
Ooh, wanna see our secret
mini-cars from the '50s

57:29.029 --> 57:30.822
that we drive
in our secret under-pier?

57:30.905 --> 57:31.966
Gene: Yes.
Louise: No, we don't.

57:31.990 --> 57:32.991
Oh, goody.

57:34.951 --> 57:37.621
(Upbeat music playing)

57:37.704 --> 57:40.415
Okay, so this is here.

57:42.917 --> 57:43.918
(Engine starts)

57:44.002 --> 57:46.212
Excellent
for storage under piers.

57:46.379 --> 57:48.506
Old ride parts over there.

57:48.673 --> 57:49.841
Carousel horses!

57:49.924 --> 57:51.051
Shh, I'm doing this tour.

57:51.217 --> 57:53.386
Carousel horses over there.

57:53.887 --> 57:55.680
We can get ice cream
any time we want.

57:55.805 --> 57:56.806
Hello. Bye.

57:57.182 --> 57:58.516
The stuffed animal storage unit.

57:58.600 --> 58:00.268
For when you need
a little snuggle.

58:00.352 --> 58:02.437
Hmm, not as many in here
as | would have thought.

58:02.604 --> 58:04.773
Maybe you're right, Felix.
Maybe they do come to life.

58:04.939 --> 58:05.940
| told you.

58:06.274 --> 58:08.360
This was our
daycare center-slash-bar.

58:08.443 --> 58:09.444
Had to close it.

58:09.527 --> 58:11.237
Yep, kids couldn't handle
their liquor.

58:11.404 --> 58:13.907
Okay, now that we got that
out of our system...

58:13.990 --> 58:17.994
Uh, Felix, is that a stain
on the back of your outfit?

58:18.078 --> 58:19.079
Oh, god, no.

58:19.162 --> 58:20.580
(Grunting)

58:20.664 --> 58:22.391
Mr. Fischoeder, we have
to tell you something.

58:22.415 --> 58:23.416
It's about Felix.

58:23.500 --> 58:24.602
- We think that he's...
- (Thud)

58:24.626 --> 58:26.503
(Yelling)

58:26.586 --> 58:27.647
- (Gruntys)
- Calvin: Ah, grover,

58:27.671 --> 58:29.214
- nice of you to join us.
- (Groaning)

58:29.297 --> 58:31.800
Will you ever not be awkward
when you come down that slide?

58:31.883 --> 58:33.843
(Grunts) Someday. Heh.

58:33.927 --> 58:34.987
| feel like
I'm getting better at it.

58:35.011 --> 58:36.763
S\ (g qle}
-Felix: No, you're not.

58:36.846 --> 58:39.224
- Mm, orchestramarama time.
- Feldx mm-hmm.

58:39.307 --> 58:40.725
Oh! Kids. (Chuckles)

58:40.809 --> 58:42.727
It's so great
you have kids here.

58:42.894 --> 58:44.562
Hi, kids. Sinkhole kids.

58:44.729 --> 58:46.398
Hey, uh, lawyer guy,

58:46.481 --> 58:48.608
you got a second
for some quick legal advice?

58:48.692 --> 58:49.877
- Oh. (Chuckles)
- Sure you do.

58:49.901 --> 58:52.320
We're just gonna chat
about a lawsuit I'm in.

58:52.487 --> 58:54.447
Tina, you wanted
to talk to Felix

58:54.531 --> 58:55.675
- about something?
- Mm-mm, no, | didn't.

58:55.699 --> 58:57.218
No, no, no, no,
you should talk to him now.

58:57.242 --> 58:59.160
Really? 'Cause I'd love
to not do that.

58:59.327 --> 59:00.787
Tina, talk to Felix.
You'll be fine.

59:00.870 --> 59:01.972
Felix: Oh, like
you're such a treat.

59:01.996 --> 59:02.997
Tina: Sorry, sorry.

59:03.164 --> 59:04.582
Look, why don't
| give you my card

59:04.666 --> 59:05.667
and you can... (Grunts)

59:05.750 --> 59:07.502
(Whispering)
Felix killed cotton candy Dan.

59:07.669 --> 59:08.795
He's framing his brother.

59:08.962 --> 59:09.963
What? (Scoffs)

59:10.046 --> 59:11.923
No. No. (Chuckling)

59:12.006 --> 59:14.046
Yes. We overheard him
planning to leave the country.

59:14.092 --> 59:15.385
Well, that part's true.

59:15.468 --> 59:16.862
They're both planning
to leave the country.

59:16.886 --> 59:18.572
That's why they're here.
That's why I'm here.

59:18.596 --> 59:20.473
They made me
bring them books on tape.

59:20.640 --> 59:22.120
They're mostly
coloring books on tape.

59:22.183 --> 59:23.463
| don't even know
how that works.

59:23.560 --> 59:25.186
What the hell?
They're fleeing together?

59:25.270 --> 59:26.479
That doesn't make any sense.

59:26.646 --> 59:27.897
Gene: Shall | accompany you?

59:27.981 --> 59:29.250
- Calvin: No, thank you.
- Yes, thank you.

59:29.274 --> 59:30.334
- No, thank you.
- Yes, thank you.

59:30.358 --> 59:31.419
- No, thank you.
- (Plays organ)

59:31.443 --> 59:32.628
Ooh, | like that.
What did you just do?

59:32.652 --> 59:33.653
Keep doing that.

59:33.987 --> 59:35.822
(Tina droning)

59:36.781 --> 59:38.158
Well, this is fun.

59:38.241 --> 59:39.701
Oh, um, so,

59:39.784 --> 59:42.996
have you heard... you...
From Fanny lately?

59:43.163 --> 59:44.581
Yes, we're back together-ish.

59:44.748 --> 59:47.292
That's good.
Is she less homicidal now?

59:47.459 --> 59:49.294
Yes, much less homicidal.
Thanks for asking.

59:49.461 --> 59:50.920
She's my little
Fanny Fanny boo-boo.

59:51.004 --> 59:52.255
Aw, you really love her, huh?

59:52.338 --> 59:54.018
More than | love
how | look in this ouffit.

59:54.048 --> 59:55.234
- (Organ continues playing)
- (Calvin cheering)

59:55.258 --> 59:58.636
Hmm. But, what if
how you feel about her,

59:58.803 --> 01:00:01.264
how you feel about love
doesn't ever match?

01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:03.808
How it really is?
In real life?

01:00:03.975 --> 01:00:05.059
Well, this got deep.

01:00:05.226 --> 01:00:07.146
What if no one lives up
to anyone's expectations?

01:00:07.187 --> 01:00:09.022
What if I'm just letting
a butt lead my heart

01:00:09.105 --> 01:00:10.666
- down a dead-end road?
- (Calvin continues cheering)

01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:14.569
Boy, the energy over there
seems great, doesn't it?

01:00:14.652 --> 01:00:16.154
Uh, stay in school.

01:00:16.237 --> 01:00:18.740
(Sings) La-la-la, la-la-la-la

01:00:18.823 --> 01:00:20.742
(sighs deeply)

01:00:20.825 --> 01:00:22.869
(Somber music playing)

01:00:25.205 --> 01:00:26.956
(Grunts) Darn it.

01:00:27.499 --> 01:00:28.500
(Grunts)

01:00:28.583 --> 01:00:29.751
(Sighs)

01:00:29.834 --> 01:00:31.127
(Grunts) Oh, my god.

01:00:32.712 --> 01:00:34.472
Calvin: Let's play
something jazzy, shall we?

01:00:34.547 --> 01:00:35.715
Gene: Oh, yes, | love jazz.

01:00:35.799 --> 01:00:37.425
Onh, is that gonna choke a fish?

01:00:37.592 --> 01:00:39.403
Look, | don't know
what the deal is with Felix,

01:00:39.427 --> 01:00:40.905
but you can't let them
leave the country.

01:00:40.929 --> 01:00:42.096
Mr. Fischoeder's innocent.

01:00:42.263 --> 01:00:44.557
But he said he's afraid
he can't beat the charge.

01:00:44.724 --> 01:00:47.060
That's why they're fleeing
to Cuba. In their submarine.

01:00:47.227 --> 01:00:48.704
What are you two hush-hushing
about over there?

01:00:48.728 --> 01:00:50.063
Yeah. We can whisper too.

01:00:50.146 --> 01:00:51.189
(Mimics whispering)

01:00:51.272 --> 01:00:52.273
See? It's hurtful.

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:54.275
We're talking about
oiv elng f-talolor

01:00:54.359 --> 01:00:56.027
which as your attorney
and your cousin,

01:00:56.110 --> 01:00:57.445
| advise you not to use.

01:00:57.612 --> 01:00:58.613
That thing works?

01:00:58.696 --> 01:01:00.031
And goes places?

01:01:00.198 --> 01:01:02.242
Uh, yeah. Jealous?
We tricked her out.

01:01:02.408 --> 01:01:04.536
We knew we'd eventually
have to flee the country

01:01:04.619 --> 01:01:05.745
for one reason or another.

01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:07.080
We're naughty little nellies.

01:01:07.247 --> 01:01:09.040
This baby can even
play books on tape.

01:01:09.207 --> 01:01:10.375
Grover, you bring the stuff?

01:01:10.542 --> 01:01:11.751
- Yes.
- Calvin: Oh, good.

01:01:11.918 --> 01:01:13.354
- Gene: Yay.
- It's all online, you know.

01:01:13.378 --> 01:01:15.630
How to convert a 1920s era
submarine-themed ride

01:01:15.797 --> 01:01:17.590
into an almost-real submarine.

01:01:17.757 --> 01:01:19.117
Some videos are better
than others.

01:01:19.259 --> 01:01:22.345
Avoid sub dude's,
but overall pretty simple.

01:01:22.512 --> 01:01:24.222
We shove off in an hour or so.

01:01:24.389 --> 01:01:25.533
We're just waiting for the tide.

01:01:25.557 --> 01:01:26.992
That's something
submarine people say.

01:01:27.016 --> 01:01:28.536
And some of us
will also be able to have

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:29.811
one last land poo.

01:01:29.978 --> 01:01:32.272
That's another submarine term,
| think.

01:01:32.438 --> 01:01:34.732
Yep, we'll be refueling
in a secret cove

01:01:34.816 --> 01:01:36.317
near myrtle beach by midnight.

01:01:36.484 --> 01:01:39.070
And picking up someone's
on-again off-again girlfriend.

01:01:39.153 --> 01:01:40.613
[2 ue]Q}
-Oh, shush, she's great.

01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:41.781
Okay, | forbid this.

01:01:41.948 --> 01:01:43.449
You are going to stay
in this country,

01:01:43.616 --> 01:01:45.118
(tsr t prove your innocence,

01:01:45.285 --> 01:01:46.744
and continue to be our landlord

01:01:46.828 --> 01:01:48.037
so we don't lose
-zl

01:01:48.204 --> 01:01:49.604
great speech, Louise.
Ir e=ta qyeltr

01:01:49.664 --> 01:01:50.665
yes. You're welcome.

01:01:50.748 --> 01:01:53.167
If you do decide to stay,
we should start talking

01:01:53.334 --> 01:01:54.878
- about your legal strategy.
- Boring.

01:01:54.961 --> 01:01:56.462
- And your arraignment.
- Boring-er.

01:01:56.588 --> 01:01:57.690
Grover, let me put this
on your head,

01:01:57.714 --> 01:01:58.774
so we don't have to hear you

01:01:58.798 --> 01:02:00.609
- talking, talking, talking.
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:02:00.633 --> 01:02:01.634
Felix: Yay, | did it.

01:02:01.718 --> 01:02:03.112
- | put a helmet on our lawyer.
- Oh, my god.

01:02:03.136 --> 01:02:04.554
You oughta be on an ottoman.

01:02:04.637 --> 01:02:05.906
-Louise: (Sighs) Oh, my god.
_(Calvin scatting)

01:02:05.930 --> 01:02:07.533
(Muffled) No. Don't. Stop.
Don't hit my...

01:02:07.557 --> 01:02:09.517
Okay, nobody wants
to solve this crime,

01:02:09.601 --> 01:02:11.394
and everyone is awful.

01:02:11.561 --> 01:02:12.562
Onh, let's play that game

01:02:12.645 --> 01:02:13.873
where we spin you around
till you fall over.

01:02:13.897 --> 01:02:15.165
Grover: No, no,
| don't like that game.

01:02:15.189 --> 01:02:16.691
(Scoffs)
Pictures of silly rich people

01:02:16.774 --> 01:02:19.360
who just go to Cuba whenever
they get charged with murder.

01:02:19.444 --> 01:02:21.029
-(Calvin whooping)
(Grover whimpers)

01:02:21.112 --> 01:02:23.573
Grover: Stop it! (Grunting)

01:02:23.656 --> 01:02:26.659
Louise: Nobody will help us.
Nobody cares.

01:02:26.826 --> 01:02:27.827
And the real murderer

01:02:27.911 --> 01:02:29.431
will just keep living
their life and...

01:02:33.875 --> 01:02:36.002
(Dramatic music playing)

01:02:36.085 --> 01:02:37.128
\what the...

1o\ =14

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:40.590
grover: Don't like this.

01:02:41.257 --> 01:02:43.092
No, | don't want... (Grunts)

01:02:43.176 --> 01:02:44.469
(Louise gasps)

01:02:44.677 --> 01:02:46.095
Louise: That shape.

01:02:46.304 --> 01:02:47.764
Grover:
Take this thing off me.

01:02:47.931 --> 01:02:49.891
Holy crap.

01:02:50.058 --> 01:02:51.535
Grover: Stop it!
Louise: (Whispering) Psst!

01:02:51.559 --> 01:02:53.119
- Tina. Psst!
- Tina: (Whispering) What?

01:02:53.186 --> 01:02:55.271
(Grunting meaningfully)

01:02:56.481 --> 01:02:58.524
(Whispering) Grover. Pow-pow.

01:02:58.816 --> 01:03:00.026
(Gasps) Onh.

01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:01.986
| figured it out.

01:03:02.153 --> 01:03:04.364
| figured it out.
(Grunts triumphantly)

01:03:04.447 --> 01:03:06.491
You guys seem very excited
about something.

01:03:06.658 --> 01:03:08.076
S a ceie =t
-no.

01:03:08.409 --> 01:03:10.495
-(Louise falters)
(Grover panting)

01:03:10.703 --> 01:03:11.704
Grover: What?

01:03:12.497 --> 01:03:14.497
Why are you looking at me
like that? Like | farted?

01:03:14.624 --> 01:03:15.784
They're the ones being jerky.

01:03:16.084 --> 01:03:17.752
Oh, no reason. | forget.

01:03:17.835 --> 01:03:18.836
(Laughs nervously)

01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:20.630
- What are you holding?
- Louise: Nothing.

01:03:20.922 --> 01:03:22.048
Um, candy.

01:03:22.131 --> 01:03:24.717
(Gulps) Mmm. So good.

01:03:24.801 --> 01:03:26.386
- (Gags)
- Now you're gagging.

01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:27.512
(Gags) No. Mm-mm.

01:03:27.595 --> 01:03:28.596
- (Gags)
- Let me see.

01:03:29.222 --> 01:03:30.598
He really wants some candy.

01:03:30.765 --> 01:03:31.766
Grover: Spit it.

01:03:31.891 --> 01:03:32.892
Grover: What the...

01:03:32.976 --> 01:03:34.310
Is that a tooth?

01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:36.062
It's so weird looking and...

01:03:36.145 --> 01:03:37.146
(Gasps)

01:03:38.439 --> 01:03:41.484
That's, uh, candy for you
these days.

01:03:41.651 --> 01:03:43.194
Looks like weird old teeth.

01:03:43.569 --> 01:03:45.697
Grover: | see.
And you enjoy that, do you?

01:03:46.155 --> 01:03:47.949
Yeah, well, it does the trick.

01:03:48.032 --> 01:03:50.368
Whoa, you're pointing
a spear gun at us.

01:03:50.535 --> 01:03:52.120
Yeah, right. Whoa.

01:03:52.912 --> 01:03:54.163
Nobody move.

01:03:54.872 --> 01:03:55.873
Nobody move.

01:03:56.374 --> 01:03:57.810
They went this way.
They must be close, right?

01:03:57.834 --> 01:03:58.835
Do you see '’em?

01:03:59.002 --> 01:04:01.462
Dog carnie:
| can't really see anything.

01:04:03.256 --> 01:04:05.425
(Whispers) Bob,
are those the kids' bikes?

01:04:05.508 --> 01:04:06.509
Bob: What the...

01:04:06.676 --> 01:04:08.276
E\g[e r g 18]
Mr. Fischoeder's golf cart.

01:04:08.344 --> 01:04:09.470
What is going on?

01:04:09.637 --> 01:04:11.180
| don't know.
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

01:04:11.264 --> 01:04:13.016
Oh, no, I'm slipping.

01:04:13.516 --> 01:04:15.143
Oh, my...
Now I'm slipping, too.

01:04:15.226 --> 01:04:16.227
Sorry.

01:04:16.310 --> 01:04:17.311
What's that sound?

01:04:17.478 --> 01:04:19.063
Oh, god. Hold on.

01:04:19.147 --> 01:04:20.273
How? Kegels.

01:04:22.442 --> 01:04:23.901
Huh. Well,
now | don't hear it.

01:04:24.068 --> 01:04:26.255
Come on. Let's go to the front
gate, and try to cut 'em off.

01:04:26.279 --> 01:04:27.280
Dog carnie: Okay.

01:04:27.363 --> 01:04:28.656
Carnie: No, Fitz. This way.

01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:30.867
- (Both grunt)
- Bob: Oh, god.

01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:32.535
(Bob groaning)

01:04:32.618 --> 01:04:33.911
(Gasps) Didn't hurt.

01:04:34.328 --> 01:04:35.788
Come on, let's go find the kids.

01:04:36.873 --> 01:04:38.350
Okay, yeanh,
you know what I'm gonna do?

01:04:38.374 --> 01:04:40.168
I'm just gonna get
all your phones. Come on.

01:04:40.543 --> 01:04:41.603
Tina: We don't have phones.

01:04:41.627 --> 01:04:43.588
And it hasn't been an issue
socially at all.

01:04:43.755 --> 01:04:45.965
Oh, really?
A teen girl without a phone?

01:04:46.132 --> 01:04:47.172
That's what | keep saying.

01:04:47.216 --> 01:04:49.194
It's just harder to justify
every year. | mean, just...

01:04:49.218 --> 01:04:51.262

- All right then.

in the sea

Well, you caused it
then you died

(harmonizing)
Oh, that's so careless of us

01:10:35.022 --> 01:10:36.315
yeah, what they'll say is this.

01:10:36.482 --> 01:10:37.608
Metal wheels on metal tracks

01:10:37.691 --> 01:10:38.960
will cause a spark,
a little flare

01:10:38.984 --> 01:10:40.212
whoops, the drapes,
they catch on fire

01:10:40.236 --> 01:10:41.505
and it just gets worse
from there

01:10:41.529 --> 01:10:42.655
up it goes into the molehill

01:10:42.738 --> 01:10:43.924
which now seems to be quite full

01:10:43.948 --> 01:10:45.199
of cute and fluffy, very burny

01:10:45.282 --> 01:10:46.534
flammable stuffed animals

01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:48.345
- s0, they don't come to life?
- 1 guess not.

01:10:48.369 --> 01:10:50.996
And then the molehill turns
into mole hell.

01:10:51.163 --> 01:10:52.498
That's what we call dad's back.

01:10:52.581 --> 01:10:54.291
- We do?
- Oh, oh-oh

with this plan

01:10:59.422 --> 01:11:00.798
Gone. I'm closing early.
What else?

01:11:00.965 --> 01:11:02.842
You would burn in the fire, too?

01:11:03.008 --> 01:11:04.552
Nope. | made a fuse
out of cooking oil,

01:11:04.635 --> 01:11:06.178
sugar and balloon string.

01:11:06.345 --> 01:11:08.139
All things you'd find
in an amusement pier.

01:11:08.305 --> 01:11:09.473
It's gonna go up the stairs,

01:11:09.557 --> 01:11:11.142
over the roof
of this stupid room.

01:11:11.308 --> 01:11:16.063
And arson investigators
will never suspect a thing

01:11:16.230 --> 01:11:18.899
my fuse and my brilliant
flammable stuffed animals idea

01:11:19.066 --> 01:11:20.669
gives me just enough time
to get back to the gym,

01:11:20.693 --> 01:11:21.694
which is my alibi.

01:11:21.777 --> 01:11:22.879
| went there just an hour ago

01:17:53.001 --> 01:17:55.295
(Grunts)
| can't get my legs up.

01:17:55.629 --> 01:17:57.589
(Bob and Linda grunting)

01:17:57.673 --> 01:17:59.716
It's fine.
You're just a bulldozer.

01:17:59.883 --> 01:18:02.469
A lobster bulldozer
pushing some dirt into a hole.

01:18:02.636 --> 01:18:04.596
Not onto a family.
No, far from it.

01:18:04.763 --> 01:18:07.140
Just fixing the street
like a helpful little lobster.

01:18:09.059 --> 01:18:10.328
Oh, my god.
We're being buried alive

01:18:10.352 --> 01:18:11.704
in a hole
in front of our restaurant.

01:18:11.728 --> 01:18:14.273
This is my nightmare.
We're living my nightmare.

01:18:14.439 --> 01:18:16.358
Phones. We can use our phones.
Where are they?

01:18:16.525 --> 01:18:18.902
- Grover took our phones.
- (Hyperventilates)

01:18:18.986 --> 01:18:21.113
Holy crap. Oh, god. (Huffs)

01:18:21.196 --> 01:18:22.197
Kids, hold my hands.

01:18:22.364 --> 01:18:24.044
Where are your hands?
Where are your hands?

01:18:24.074 --> 01:18:26.326
And put that memory in a place
you don't think about.

01:18:26.493 --> 01:18:28.036
Now, let's get back
to the wharf,

01:18:28.203 --> 01:18:29.872
launch my cousins into the sea,

01:18:29.955 --> 01:18:31.665
and we're back on track, baby.

01:18:31.999 --> 01:18:33.500
(Bob and Linda grunting)

01:18:33.584 --> 01:18:36.086
Bob: Okay, | gotta think.
| don't wanna breathe

01:18:36.169 --> 01:18:37.671
- all of our oxygen.
- Linda: Oh!

01:18:37.754 --> 01:18:39.131
Bob: Yeah,
not to scare anybody,

01:18:39.214 --> 01:18:40.483
but, um, don't breathe too much.

01:18:40.507 --> 01:18:41.734
[Linda: I'm gonna
(O] Ole] (== 1nallg[E]

01:18:41.758 --> 01:18:43.278
You kids breathe my air.
(Inhales deeply)

01:18:43.302 --> 01:18:44.529
Bob: No, lin, just...
Linda: (Exhales) Oh, god.

01:18:44.553 --> 01:18:46.179
[Irt (o] How long was that?

01:18:46.346 --> 01:18:47.426
Louise: Like, five minutes.

01:18:47.472 --> 01:18:49.492
Tina: | think | could breathe
less if it wasn't so dark.

01:18:49.516 --> 01:18:51.797
Gene: | have something that
will make people breathe less.

01:18:51.852 --> 01:18:54.605
- All: Oh, gene.
- I'm sorry, it's a fear fart.

01:18:54.688 --> 01:18:57.107
Louise: Oh! | have
my kuchi kopi night light.

01:18:57.482 --> 01:18:59.234
All: Ah! No.

01:18:59.568 --> 01:19:01.153
Ah. No.

01:19:01.737 --> 01:19:05.073
Ugh! Stay on, kuchi.
It's your one job!

01:19:05.490 --> 01:19:07.409
Gene: This is like
the worst rave.

01:19:07.492 --> 01:19:09.745
(Grover humming)

01:19:13.832 --> 01:19:15.709
Sorry, sorry, sorry. Bye.

01:19:24.217 --> 01:19:26.511
Well, he's officially
my least favorite cousin.

01:19:26.595 --> 01:19:28.555
- What about Baxter?
- He's dead.

01:19:28.639 --> 01:19:29.741
Yeah, but he's still the worst.

01:19:29.765 --> 01:19:30.766
That's true.

01:19:30.849 --> 01:19:33.226
Okey dokey.
Submarine launch, check.

01:19:33.393 --> 01:19:34.561
All right. Fuse.

01:19:34.728 --> 01:19:36.688
So glad | made a to-do list.
(Snortys)

01:19:42.069 --> 01:19:43.070
Damn it.

01:19:45.364 --> 01:19:46.365
Oh, good.

01:19:48.909 --> 01:19:50.118
Oh, my god.

01:19:55.499 --> 01:19:56.667
(Humming)

01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:58.585
Yep. (Scatting)

01:19:58.669 --> 01:19:59.670
(Singing) I'm doin’ it

01:19:59.836 --> 01:20:01.672
I'm doin’ it I'm doin' it

01:20:02.089 --> 01:20:04.841
(Bob grunting)

01:20:04.925 --> 01:20:06.218
Bob: | can't break it.

01:20:06.385 --> 01:20:07.844
Louise: This is all my fault.

01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:10.347
Well, don't everybody
speak at once.

01:20:10.514 --> 01:20:13.392
Linda: No, honey, it's not
your fault. That much.

01:20:13.475 --> 01:20:14.476
Louise: It is though.

01:20:14.559 --> 01:20:16.687
| wanted to track down
the killer

01:20:16.770 --> 01:20:19.690
and save the restaurant
and prove... (Sighs)

01:20:19.773 --> 01:20:21.191
Prove | wasn't a baby.

01:20:21.358 --> 01:20:22.609
Oh! Now you come on.

01:20:22.776 --> 01:20:24.569
Oh, my baby. | mean, sorry.

01:20:24.736 --> 01:20:28.323
No, stupid Chloe barbash
was right. | am a baby.

01:20:28.490 --> 01:20:30.075
| was too scared
to go in the hole,

01:20:30.242 --> 01:20:32.577
| was too scared to open
the secret nipple door.

01:20:32.744 --> 01:20:34.079
Tina had to do it for me,

01:20:34.162 --> 01:20:36.665
and | wear these frickin' ears.

01:20:37.249 --> 01:20:38.417
| mean, if you're brave,

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:40.210
you don't have to prove
you're brave.

01:20:40.377 --> 01:20:41.753
You just are brave.

01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:44.214
Bob: What?
Louise, you're brave.

01:20:44.381 --> 01:20:45.966
You're one of
the bravest people | know.

01:20:46.049 --> 01:20:47.134
Louise: If's not true.

01:20:47.217 --> 01:20:49.261
Also, you don't know
that many people.

01:20:49.344 --> 01:20:50.345
Bob: Hmm.

01:20:50.429 --> 01:20:52.931
Louise: I've never been brave.
Come on, the ears?

01:20:53.098 --> 01:20:54.867
The only reason | got these
in the first place

01:20:54.891 --> 01:20:55.976
was because | was scared.

01:20:56.059 --> 01:20:57.245
Bob: What?
Linda: What do you mean?

01:20:57.269 --> 01:20:58.538
Louise: You know.
You gave them to me

01:20:58.562 --> 01:21:00.665
'‘cause | was scared about
the first day of preschool.

01:21:00.689 --> 01:21:02.190
That's not how it happened.

01:21:02.357 --> 01:21:03.442
| mean, you were nervous,

01:21:03.525 --> 01:21:05.485
and we had this idea
to make you the hat.

01:21:05.652 --> 01:21:06.862
Your mother made it.

01:21:07.029 --> 01:21:08.947
It's sort of in honor of my mom,

01:21:09.031 --> 01:21:10.157
your grandmother.

01:21:10.323 --> 01:21:13.660
She used to wear this
brightly-colored winter hat.

01:21:14.453 --> 01:21:17.080
Even in warm weather.
It was a little weird.

01:21:17.247 --> 01:21:20.000
But it was kinda cute, | guess.

01:21:20.417 --> 01:21:21.418
She always said it was

01:21:21.501 --> 01:21:22.937
‘cause she didn't feel
like doing her hair.

01:21:22.961 --> 01:21:24.087
| think she just liked it.

01:21:24.254 --> 01:21:26.757
And | had extra material,
so, uh, rabbit ears.

01:21:26.923 --> 01:21:29.134
But | made them after
your first day at preschool.

01:21:29.301 --> 01:21:31.136
To celebrate.
Because you were so brave.

01:21:31.303 --> 01:21:33.305
Louise: Really? | was?
Bon and Linda: Yeah.

01:21:33.388 --> 01:21:34.615
Bob: Do you not remember it
that way?

01:21:34.639 --> 01:21:35.640
Louise: No.

01:21:35.724 --> 01:21:36.784
Bob: Yeah,
you didn't need them.

01:21:36.808 --> 01:21:39.144
Linda: You were plenty brave,
with no hat at all.

01:21:39.686 --> 01:21:41.021
We were so proud of you.

01:21:41.188 --> 01:21:42.647
- You slapped a kid.
- Louise: | did?

01:21:42.731 --> 01:21:44.667
Linda: Yeah. Probably for
a good reason, let's say.

01:21:44.691 --> 01:21:46.777
Bob: You remind me
of my mom, Louise.

01:21:46.943 --> 01:21:48.278
And with the hat,

01:21:48.361 --> 01:21:49.905
it's kinda like
you two have met.

01:21:50.072 --> 01:21:51.907
| keep forgetting
that you never did.

01:21:52.407 --> 01:21:54.218
Gene: | wore that bucket
on my head for a while.

01:21:54.242 --> 01:21:55.368
Any fun stories about that?

01:21:55.535 --> 01:21:58.205
Bob: No, | don't remember any.
We were concerned.

01:21:58.371 --> 01:22:00.248
Louise: Well, thanks.

01:22:00.791 --> 01:22:01.958
For the hat and stuff.

01:22:02.125 --> 01:22:03.605
Bob: Yep. Glad we could
clear that up,

01:22:03.668 --> 01:22:04.854
- since we're dying.
- (All groan)

01:22:04.878 --> 01:22:06.421
| mean, since
we're just hanging out,

01:22:06.505 --> 01:22:07.672
alive, under the ground.

01:22:07.839 --> 01:22:09.591
I'm gonna push on the window
wg r \a tr

01:22:09.674 --> 01:22:11.510
- (thud)
- Ow! (Grunting)

01:22:11.593 --> 01:22:12.886
This is not working.

01:22:13.053 --> 01:22:14.930
Linda: That's it then.
We're goners.

01:22:15.097 --> 01:22:16.598
Bob: Wait,
no, don't you give up.

01:22:16.765 --> 01:22:17.766
Linda: I'm tired, Bob.

01:22:17.933 --> 01:22:19.476
Bob: No, you never give up.

01:22:19.643 --> 01:22:21.686
| give up. And then you say,
"don't give up."

01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:22.771
And | say, "okay,"

01:22:22.854 --> 01:22:24.174
and then we do that
over and over,

01:22:24.231 --> 01:22:25.941
and now that I'm saying it
out loud,

01:22:26.024 --> 01:22:27.442
that can't be fun for you.

01:22:27.609 --> 01:22:29.820
Oh, god, do you want
a divorce before we die?

01:22:29.903 --> 01:22:30.987
| don't deserve you.

01:22:31.071 --> 01:22:32.489
Linda: Nah,
| can stick it out.

01:22:32.656 --> 01:22:35.492
Bob: Listen to me, I'm gonna
do for you what you do for me.

01:22:35.659 --> 01:22:38.078
| am not giving up.
We are gonna get outta here.

01:22:38.245 --> 01:22:39.621
| am gonna Linda this.

01:22:39.704 --> 01:22:41.373
- All: Whoal!
- Dad, are you fonzie?

01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:43.220
Yeah, you made
the little koko puffs go on.

01:22:43.291 --> 01:22:44.371
Bob and Louise: Kuchi kopi.

01:22:44.417 --> 01:22:45.418
- Koochi koochi?
- No.

01:22:45.502 --> 01:22:46.628
Well, the light's helpful,

01:22:46.711 --> 01:22:48.296
because we are gonna
get out of here.

01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:49.381
How?

01:22:49.464 --> 01:22:52.050
In a really cool way
that's gonna come to us.

01:22:52.217 --> 01:22:54.928
| mean, we're in a car, kind of.

01:22:55.095 --> 01:22:56.930
What if we drive?

01:22:57.013 --> 01:22:58.056
Where? Down?

01:22:58.140 --> 01:22:59.141
Like, to China?

01:22:59.224 --> 01:23:00.433
| like it. | like it.

01:23:00.517 --> 01:23:01.560
Not to China.

01:23:01.643 --> 01:23:03.311
- But no bad ideas.
- L mean...

01:23:03.395 --> 01:23:04.396
Oh. Down.

01:23:04.479 --> 01:23:05.665
-What if we do drive down?
Srrv o - 1%

01:23:05.689 --> 01:23:07.190
we're on top of the water main.

01:23:07.357 --> 01:23:10.360
The new section of pipe
is plastic. We lost a tire.

01:23:10.527 --> 01:23:13.738
(V=w ol=nasl=iec1 mo glalollglo)
Against plastic. Metal wins?

01:23:13.905 --> 01:23:15.115
Grinding like sexy dancing?

01:23:15.198 --> 01:23:16.300
- What's that?
- Never mind. Go on.

01:23:16.324 --> 01:23:17.701
So the wheel breaks the pipe,

01:23:17.784 --> 01:23:19.327
and the water
gets us out somehow?

01:23:19.494 --> 01:23:21.288
Or it could do
the other thing water does.

01:23:21.454 --> 01:23:22.539
Hot tub time machine?

01:23:22.622 --> 01:23:23.623
No. Drown us.

01:23:23.707 --> 01:23:25.792
Oh, well,
| never saw the movie, so...

01:23:25.876 --> 01:23:27.836
(Sighs) I think
this is our only chance.

01:23:27.919 --> 01:23:28.920
I'm turning it on.

01:23:29.254 --> 01:23:30.839
(Engine revving)

01:23:30.922 --> 01:23:31.965
Oh, Bobby, kids,

01:23:32.048 --> 01:23:33.526
| want you all to know
how much | love you.

01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:34.551
| love you too, mom.

01:23:34.634 --> 01:23:35.719
| love all you mama-jamas.

01:23:35.802 --> 01:23:36.845
| love all of you, too.

01:23:37.012 --> 01:23:38.656
We don't have to, like,
do any kind of order,

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:39.681
why even bring that up?

01:23:39.764 --> 01:23:41.183
Okay, I'm worried
the "l love yous"

01:23:41.266 --> 01:23:43.119
are the kind of thing you say
when we're gonna die,

01:23:43.143 --> 01:23:46.771
and we are not gonna die!

01:23:47.063 --> 01:23:48.231
(Accelerating)

01:23:48.732 --> 01:23:51.902
Bob! Linda! Are you up there?

01:23:52.402 --> 01:23:55.071
Oh, looks like they started
filling in your hole.

01:23:55.238 --> 01:23:56.740
Not well, at all.

01:23:56.907 --> 01:23:58.987
Jeesh, they just kind of
shoved some dirt in there...

01:23:59.451 --> 01:24:01.536
(Yelps) What the...

01:24:01.995 --> 01:24:03.496
(All grunt, laugh)

01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:04.915
Bob: It worked.
7=

01:24:05.081 --> 01:24:06.166
oh, my sweet babies.

01:24:06.333 --> 01:24:07.626
So glad we're not dead.

01:24:07.792 --> 01:24:09.085
- I'm happy.
- I'm thrilled.

01:24:09.252 --> 01:24:11.213
You guys, the fischoeders,
in the submarine,

01:24:11.296 --> 01:24:12.536
with the wharf falling on them.

01:24:12.589 --> 01:24:13.924
What do we do? What do we do?

01:24:14.007 --> 01:24:16.134
-(Gruntys) It's still stuck.
_(All grunting)

01:24:16.218 --> 01:24:17.695
-(Knock on window)
_all: (Muffled) Teddy!

01:24:17.719 --> 01:24:19.012
Teddy, help us outta here.

01:24:19.179 --> 01:24:20.379
(Muffled)
The thing won't open.

01:24:20.472 --> 01:24:22.224
Did you guys get a new car?

01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:24.142
I've never seen this before.

01:24:24.309 --> 01:24:25.629
(Muffled)
Have | seen this before?

01:24:25.685 --> 01:24:28.647
Teddy, we need you to help us
open this. The thing is stuck.

01:24:28.813 --> 01:24:30.613
- This thing is stuck.
- (Muffled) It's stuck.

01:24:30.690 --> 01:24:32.400
(Muffled)
Argh! | can't open it.

01:24:32.567 --> 01:24:33.860
- What'd he say?
- 1 do not know.

01:24:34.027 --> 01:24:36.988
So, bad news,
the burger cart fell apart.

01:24:37.155 --> 01:24:39.532
It was just too beautiful
for this world.

01:24:39.616 --> 01:24:40.867
(Indistinct, muffled speaking)

01:24:40.951 --> 01:24:42.431
\[eligllgle}
No idea what he's saying.

01:24:42.577 --> 01:24:43.578
Ohl

01:24:44.204 --> 01:24:45.413
Louise: Well, Teddy left.

01:24:45.664 --> 01:24:46.998
(Panting)

01:24:47.749 --> 01:24:49.209
Long story.
I'll tell you later.

01:24:49.834 --> 01:24:52.504
(Grover grunts, pants)

01:24:52.587 --> 01:24:54.047
(Bob grunting)

01:24:54.130 --> 01:24:57.592
(Yelling) Olive bar!

01:24:58.969 --> 01:25:00.011
(Grunting)

01:25:00.095 --> 01:25:01.930
- What did he say?
- Olive bar.

01:25:02.138 --> 01:25:03.139
Yah!

01:25:03.223 --> 01:25:04.599
Bob: Yes.
Louise: Yes.

01:25:04.683 --> 01:25:06.101
Gene: Wham-bam, goodbye, clam.

01:25:06.268 --> 01:25:07.560
Thank you, Teddy.

01:25:07.727 --> 01:25:09.729
- Olive bar!
- Yeah, yeah. No, | know.

01:25:09.813 --> 01:25:10.939
Dad, you have a pee spot.

01:25:11.022 --> 01:25:13.233
That's not a pee spot.
It's from water.

01:25:13.316 --> 01:25:15.151
See? All the water?
But thanks, Tina.

01:25:15.318 --> 01:25:17.070
It's right where
a pee spot would be.

01:25:17.153 --> 01:25:18.697
And no other parts are wet.

01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:21.074
Um, okay.
So, Teddy, call the police.

01:25:21.241 --> 01:25:22.242
Kids, stay here.

01:25:22.450 --> 01:25:24.035
Uh, Linda, stay with the kids.

01:25:24.202 --> 01:25:25.482
I'm gonna run down to the wharf,

01:25:25.537 --> 01:25:28.623
and try and help the
fischoeders not get killed.

01:25:28.707 --> 01:25:29.749
Um, good plan.

01:25:29.833 --> 01:25:31.668
(Panting)

01:25:31.751 --> 01:25:33.169
Wait, why are you following me?

01:25:33.336 --> 01:25:35.213
- We're not.
- Okay, but you are.

01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:36.589
No, we're not. Bye, Bob.

01:25:36.756 --> 01:25:38.476
Yeah, and maybe
mind your own business, dad?

01:25:38.633 --> 01:25:39.968
Hello? Is this the police?

01:25:40.135 --> 01:25:42.887
I'd like to report a thing.
A thing happened.

01:25:43.346 --> 01:25:44.848
You need more than that?
Hold on.

01:25:45.015 --> 01:25:46.655
My good friend,
Linda's gonna talk to you.

01:25:46.725 --> 01:25:49.269
She's married
to my best friend. Hello?

01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:52.188
(Suspenseful music playing)

01:25:56.860 --> 01:25:58.737
Climbing through the window.

01:26:00.613 --> 01:26:02.282
Hmm? Hmm? Onh.

01:26:02.365 --> 01:26:03.992
Come on,
someone moved the thing?

01:26:04.701 --> 01:26:08.038
(Sighs)
| do have three-hour gym body.

01:26:08.121 --> 01:26:09.831
-(Grunts, yelps)
(Thud)

01:26:10.248 --> 01:26:12.625
Teddy: Grover fischoeder wants
to destroy the whole pier?

01:26:12.792 --> 01:26:14.294
Louise: Yeanh,
to build a mega-park.

01:26:14.461 --> 01:26:16.063
Linda: With gift shops.
Teddy: Oh, gift shops.

01:26:16.087 --> 01:26:17.315
Linda: | know,
but not worth it, right?

01:26:17.339 --> 01:26:18.524
Teddy: Yeah, no.
Right, right, right.

01:26:18.548 --> 01:26:20.026
Bob: Where's the fuse?
Where's the fuse?

01:26:20.050 --> 01:26:21.176
- Where's the fuse?
- There!

01:26:23.386 --> 01:26:24.512
Bob: Oh, my god. All right.

01:26:24.679 --> 01:26:25.906
Give me your night light
for a sec.

01:26:25.930 --> 01:26:27.241
I'm gonna see
if | can climb down.

01:26:27.265 --> 01:26:28.933
| didn't even know
| was still holding it.

01:26:29.100 --> 01:26:31.287
| guess | need a night light
everywhere | go. That's great.

01:26:31.311 --> 01:26:32.538
- Louise.
- It's fine, it's fine.

01:26:32.562 --> 01:26:34.230
- Don't mess him up.
- Oh.

01:26:35.899 --> 01:26:37.776
Linda: That is terrifying.

01:26:37.942 --> 01:26:39.736
Yeah, you'd think
it would be comforting.

01:26:39.903 --> 01:26:41.363
Everybody,
please get out of here.

01:26:41.529 --> 01:26:42.739
Linda: Bob, don't do it.

01:26:42.822 --> 01:26:44.133
| don't want you
to catch on fire.

01:26:44.157 --> 01:26:45.325
| don't think you'd like it.

01:26:45.492 --> 01:26:46.652
Just get away from the wharf.

01:26:46.785 --> 01:26:48.304
Don't worry. I'll be fine.
| can make it.

01:26:48.328 --> 01:26:50.038
(Okay, you're too positive
gle[Ai@gle)2

01:26:50.121 --> 01:26:51.289
maybe take it down a notch?

01:26:51.456 --> 01:26:52.582
Big jump!

01:26:52.957 --> 01:26:54.000
(Grunts) Ow.

01:26:55.210 --> 01:26:57.212
Look at him go.
| mean, kind of.

01:26:57.379 --> 01:26:59.798
He's not used
to this much physical...

01:26:59.964 --> 01:27:00.965
Um, dad, go faster.

01:27:01.132 --> 01:27:03.176
Gene: Do you need your
workout mix? If you had one?

01:27:03.676 --> 01:27:06.596
(Gruntys)
No, I'm good. Thank you.

01:27:06.679 --> 01:27:09.557
- (Whirring)
- Dad! Dad, get off the track.

01:27:09.724 --> 01:27:11.226
I'm gonna ride the ride down.

01:27:11.393 --> 01:27:12.394
Louise!

01:27:12.477 --> 01:27:13.871
Not the best time
for going on rides.

01:27:13.895 --> 01:27:15.313
Louise, no.
It's too dangerous.

01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:17.124
Louise: Dad, you're not
gonna make it in time.

01:27:17.148 --> 01:27:18.817
But the track goes
right past the fuse.

01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:20.360
I'm gonna grab it when | go by.

01:27:20.527 --> 01:27:21.528
No, I'm gonna make it.

01:27:21.611 --> 01:27:23.655
I'm starting to get good
at this. Oh!

01:27:24.155 --> 01:27:25.198
- Oh, boy.
- Oh.

01:27:25.281 --> 01:27:26.282
Oh, my god.

01:27:26.449 --> 01:27:28.368
Come on, mole.
Don't be so slow.

01:27:28.535 --> 01:27:30.495
Still faster than you, dad,
though. No offense.

01:27:30.662 --> 01:27:33.039
Yeah, but there's
a wicked turn coming up.

01:27:33.206 --> 01:27:34.374
1n ei r a

01:27:34.541 --> 01:27:35.917
oh, Louise, be careful.

01:27:36.084 --> 01:27:38.128
Don't get decapitated
and then burned up.

01:27:38.294 --> 01:27:39.295
| won't. Whoal

01:27:40.630 --> 01:27:41.631
dad, you look like

01:27:41.714 --> 01:27:43.025
you're about to climb
right in front of me?

01:27:43.049 --> 01:27:45.009
Nope, I'm gonna leap across
really quickly.

01:27:45.093 --> 01:27:46.970
(Gruntys)
Oh, god. Not that quickly.

01:27:47.137 --> 01:27:48.680
Get off the track!

01:27:48.930 --> 01:27:50.181
(Bob grunts)

01:27:51.099 --> 01:27:53.143
Bob: Oh, it's getting close
to the animals.

01:27:53.309 --> 01:27:54.352
Okay, got it.

01:27:54.519 --> 01:27:56.163
If you miss,
we won't have a second chance.

| know. Very helpful info.
Ir e=ta qyeltr

01:27:58.690 --> 01:28:01.010
Bob: You might have been right
about your way being faster.

01:28:01.151 --> 01:28:03.361
| mean, just a lot of beams.

01:28:03.528 --> 01:28:05.321

Or are we all dead?

I'm bravel!
I'm brave!

| am brave!

01:28:51.493 --> 01:28:52.994
And super humble!

01:28:53.161 --> 01:28:55.038
Hey, dad!
Good work to both of you.

01:28:55.205 --> 01:28:57.081
(Panting)
Thank you. Thank you.

01:28:59.375 --> 01:29:01.544
I'm gonna miss that pier.
And being alive.

01:29:01.711 --> 01:29:03.129
- And you, my friend.
- Aww.

01:29:03.213 --> 01:29:04.214
- Got ya.
- Ow!

01:29:04.297 --> 01:29:05.399
You owe me a thousand dollars.

01:29:05.423 --> 01:29:06.503
Let's play for two. Switch.

01:29:06.633 --> 01:29:07.753
I'm gonna miss you too, pal.

01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:09.160
I've always looked up to...
Got ya.

- (Thud)
- That's interesting.

01:29:15.475 --> 01:29:17.369
| wonder if that's a giant
squid trying to mate with us.

01:29:17.393 --> 01:29:18.593
Well, it could do a lot worse.

01:29:21.648 --> 01:29:23.775

Ooh, uh, Teddy, can | borrow
your phone real quick?

01:29:35.245 --> 01:29:36.579
Uh, here.
Yeah, sure.

01:29:36.663 --> 01:29:38.122
(Gasps)
Are you ordering takeout?

01:29:38.289 --> 01:29:39.832
Can we get traditional
Thai street food

01:29:39.916 --> 01:29:40.917
from that new place?

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.502
No, I'm not ordering takeout.
Sorry.

01:29:42.585 --> 01:29:43.628
Oh, boo.

01:29:43.795 --> 01:29:45.463
Yeah, a lot of people
think of robbery

01:29:45.547 --> 01:29:47.507
as kind of the coolest
division, you know?

01:29:47.674 --> 01:29:49.527
- Where the cool cops work.

01:29:49.551 --> 01:29:50.677
| don't know if that's true.

01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:52.428
But, uh, you know,
lot of people think it.

01:29:52.512 --> 01:29:53.513
Hello.

Bye, front desk person.

| remember your, uh, shirt.
(Chuckleys)

01:29:59.978 --> 01:30:02.105
You probably remember me too,
right? This face?

01:30:02.272 --> 01:30:03.666
You're not looking up.
Bri (cry[Elv n e[O}

01:30:03.690 --> 01:30:05.942

right? You have earbuds in.

Did you hear anything | said?
Onh, you did.

01:30:07.610 --> 01:30:10.321
Good. Anyway,
this is grover fischoeder

Hi, there.
First on the scene. No biggie.

01:30:16.911 --> 01:30:19.080
| beat you.
And you.

01:30:19.247 --> 01:30:20.456
| beat you too.

01:30:20.540 --> 01:30:21.624

and screaming)

Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

01:30:40.810 --> 01:30:42.687
How're you feeling, buddy?
You nervous?

01:30:42.854 --> 01:30:44.397
Oh, no. It just feels
like my insides

01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:45.916
are fighting to get out
of my bottom hole.

01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:47.817
Hey, listen,
you're gonna be great.

01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:52.238
Uh-huh. Or we're gonna be bad
and insides out on stage.

01:30:52.405 --> 01:30:54.741
You know, | heard you guys
practicing in the basement

01:30:54.907 --> 01:30:56.176
when | was cleaning up
last night.

01:30:56.200 --> 01:30:57.201
- You did?
- Yeah.

01:30:57.285 --> 01:30:59.329
And you sounded great.
Parts were great.

01:30:59.495 --> 01:31:01.331
And your music,
it makes you happy,

01:31:01.414 --> 01:31:02.457
- right?
- Yeah.

01:31:02.540 --> 01:31:04.310
Well, it's gonna make
other people happy, too.

01:31:04.334 --> 01:31:06.711
S0 maybe you should be
UN-stop-timistic about it.

01:31:06.878 --> 01:31:08.212
- Mom says that.
- Yeah.

01:31:08.379 --> 01:31:10.214
- S0, you're stealing.
- L say it now, too.

01:31:10.381 --> 01:31:12.175
Also, she's helping Tina
with her wig,

01:31:12.258 --> 01:31:14.719
so | have to try and say
what she would say.

01:31:14.802 --> 01:31:15.803
Take her material.

01:31:15.887 --> 01:31:17.138
Yes.
Come here.

01:31:17.472 --> 01:31:18.890
- (Gruntys)
- Thanks, dad!

01:31:18.973 --> 01:31:20.016
Just have fun up there.

01:31:20.099 --> 01:31:21.339
That's such a shorter pep talk.

01:31:22.602 --> 01:31:23.662
(Singing)
Let me hear you say...

01:31:23.686 --> 01:31:25.813
-(Rattling)
Ni ni ce t @yol at ) /a

01:31:25.897 --> 01:31:27.148
- (Louise trills)
- Yeah

01:31:27.315 --> 01:31:28.858
twist it, twirl it, cook it, bake it

01:31:28.941 --> 01:31:30.026
do your thing

01:31:30.109 --> 01:31:31.903

01:31:32.236 --> 01:31:33.780
(Kids scatting)

01:31:33.863 --> 01:31:36.866
Yeah, shake those
little burger buns

01:31:37.033 --> 01:31:38.284
- okay. Got it!
- Good!

01:31:38.451 --> 01:31:42.497
Here is a check for
all the money we owe you.

01:31:42.664 --> 01:31:44.391
- For this month.
- Bob: Yeah, for this month.

01:31:44.415 --> 01:31:46.292
Thanks to
our very grateful landlord.

01:31:46.459 --> 01:31:48.211
| still think
he's not grateful enough.

01:31:48.378 --> 01:31:50.630
That's true. He could be
even more grateful.

01:31:50.797 --> 01:31:53.466
But still, signing it.
This doesn't ook right.

01:31:53.633 --> 01:31:55.468
R I \a e [a e (=)S
uh, let's just say yes.

01:31:56.469 --> 01:31:58.846
So there, we did it, Mr. Bank.
(Grunts)

01:31:58.930 --> 01:32:00.598
Please don't call me Mr. Bank.

01:32:00.682 --> 01:32:01.909
- Sorry.
- People aren't usually

01:32:01.933 --> 01:32:04.519
so cocky when they make
their very late loan payments.

01:32:04.686 --> 01:32:06.020
Well, get used to it.

01:32:06.187 --> 01:32:07.522
- One more. (Grunts)
- Ow.

01:32:07.605 --> 01:32:09.774
(Playing upbeat music)

01:32:12.151 --> 01:32:13.236
Hey, Tina.

01:32:13.319 --> 01:32:15.238
Oh, hey, Jimmy Jr.
Happy last day of school.

01:32:15.321 --> 01:32:16.322
Thanks. You too.

01:32:16.406 --> 01:32:18.991
So, | was doing parkour
down on the beach with Zeke,

01:32:19.158 --> 01:32:20.438
we're really good at parkouring,

01:32:20.493 --> 01:32:21.773
or I'm really good
at parkouring.

01:32:21.911 --> 01:32:23.371
Anyway, | found this.

01:32:23.579 --> 01:32:25.289
- (Gasps)
- It made me think of you.

01:32:25.456 --> 01:32:27.750
Maybe because you have
the same kind of barrette.

01:32:27.917 --> 01:32:29.794
Do you want it?
It smells like seaweed.

01:32:29.961 --> 01:32:31.212
-Jimmy Jr.?
A v-1aws

01:32:31.295 --> 01:32:32.481
there's something
| wanted to ask you.

01:32:32.505 --> 01:32:34.549
Something
summer boyfriend-related.

01:32:34.716 --> 01:32:37.176
But then | thought maybe
it was a stupid question

01:32:37.343 --> 01:32:39.387
for anyone to ask anyone ever.

01:32:39.470 --> 01:32:40.739
- (Zeke grunts)
- And my heart was an idiot...

01:32:40.763 --> 01:32:42.807
2o}
-Zeke: Rolling, rolling.

01:32:42.974 --> 01:32:45.435
I'm doing parkour off the
locker, Jay-ju. You see me?

01:32:45.601 --> 01:32:46.894
It looked
a little awkward, Zeke.

01:32:47.061 --> 01:32:48.396
I'm working on it! Yow-za!

01:32:48.479 --> 01:32:50.565
(Laughs)
You fell off the wall.

01:32:50.648 --> 01:32:52.024
Yeah, what am | looking at here?

01:32:52.108 --> 01:32:53.109
Zeke: Parkour!

01:32:53.192 --> 01:32:54.527
Uh, what were you saying?

01:32:54.694 --> 01:32:56.904
Oh, | was saying, | thought
my heart was an idiot.

01:32:57.071 --> 01:32:59.031
But then you found
my barrette-clace.

01:32:59.198 --> 01:33:01.159
And now it kinda makes me think

01:33:01.242 --> 01:33:02.882
maybe there's only no romance
in the world

01:33:03.035 --> 01:33:05.204
if you believe there's
no romance in the world.

01:33:05.371 --> 01:33:07.290
And who wants to believe that?

01:33:08.708 --> 01:33:10.418
Now, | don't know
why | got so hung up

01:33:10.501 --> 01:33:12.086
on the question
| was gonna ask anyway.

01:33:12.253 --> 01:33:14.172
Mostly, | just really
wanna do this.

01:33:14.630 --> 01:33:16.883
(Both moaning)

01:33:18.593 --> 01:33:19.844
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

01:33:19.927 --> 01:33:22.221
(Band continues playing
upbeat music)

01:33:26.476 --> 01:33:27.536
Chloe: You're not gonna do it.

01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:28.561
Louise: I'm gonna do it.

01:33:28.644 --> 01:33:29.830
You think because you, like,
saved the wharf

01:33:29.854 --> 01:33:31.039
or something,
you're all brave now?

01:33:31.063 --> 01:33:32.398
Yeah. On three.

01:33:32.565 --> 01:33:34.609
One, two, three.

01:33:35.067 --> 01:33:37.236
(Srr etin o)
- Your hat fell off.

01:33:37.403 --> 01:33:38.404
Louise: Hmm? Oh, yeah.

01:33:38.946 --> 01:33:40.799
Louise, reminding you
that you have detention today

01:33:40.823 --> 01:33:41.903
because you skipped school.

01:33:41.991 --> 01:33:43.701
[Oh, my god, v(O lv =t r (=] Mol

01:33:43.868 --> 01:33:45.828
okay. It's okay.
What do we do? What do we do?

01:33:45.995 --> 01:33:47.195
It's fine.
It's not a big deal.

01:33:47.246 --> 01:33:48.581
Emergency counsel session?

01:33:48.664 --> 01:33:50.208
| can get puppets here (Yr 14

01:33:50.374 --> 01:33:52.210
Ms. Labonz,

01:33:52.293 --> 01:33:53.836

01:33:54.003 --> 01:33:56.005

01:33:56.172 --> 01:33:57.840
Mr. Frond, I'm good.

01:33:57.924 --> 01:34:00.009
- Oh, really?
- Ms. Labonz: She's good.

01:34:00.092 --> 01:34:01.445
- Okay. I'm so proud of you.
- Louise: Don't say

01:34:01.469 --> 01:34:02.749
- "you're so proud of me."
- Yep.

01:34:04.180 --> 01:34:06.224
Is everybody ready
to do this again?

01:34:06.307 --> 01:34:07.558
Linda: Yeah.
Gene: Sure, father.

01:34:07.642 --> 01:34:08.827
Louise: | mean, it seems
like you're making us.

01:34:08.851 --> 01:34:09.852
Teddy did a good job.

01:34:09.936 --> 01:34:10.937
Kind of. Right?

01:34:11.020 --> 01:34:13.231
Linda: Aw, banner.
| love banners.

01:34:13.314 --> 01:34:15.399
Gene: Are we dead set
on "burgers"?

01:34:15.566 --> 01:34:17.046
| mean, is it too late
to change that?

01:34:17.109 --> 01:34:18.429
Tina: Oh, yeah.
We could do wraps.

01:34:18.486 --> 01:34:19.487
Louise: Or soup.

01:34:19.570 --> 01:34:20.655
Bob: Mm.
Linda: Mm, soup.

01:34:20.738 --> 01:34:23.282
Gene: Bob's soup and wraps
has a certain sound to it.

01:34:23.366 --> 01:34:24.802
Bob: Oh, my god.
Everyone, back inside,

01:34:24.826 --> 01:34:25.827
back inside. Never mind.

01:34:26.410 --> 01:34:28.204
Kids: Thank you, wonder whart!

01:34:28.287 --> 01:34:30.122
- (Cheering)

01:34:30.289 --> 01:34:32.458
- (Cheering)
- Yeah! All right!

01:34:32.875 --> 01:34:34.877
Finally. Now, we can bring out
Johnny jazz hands.

01:34:34.961 --> 01:34:35.961
Oh, goody.

01:34:36.295 --> 01:34:38.464
(Upbeat soul song playing)

01:41:44.181 --> 01:41:46.016
(Grunting and panting)

01:41:46.100 --> 01:41:48.769
Jimmy Jr.: Uh, Tina, it's
a little crowded, isn't it?

01:41:48.852 --> 01:41:50.052
Tina: No, it's fine. Shh, shh.

01:41:50.104 --> 01:41:52.273
Jimmy Jr.: Okay.
It's just that |... (Gruntys)
