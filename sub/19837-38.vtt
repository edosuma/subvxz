<b>What's this?</b>

01:59.040 --> 02:00.730
<b>Something Ging left with me.</b>

02:00.730 --> 02:01.770
<b>Huh?</b>

02:01.770 --> 02:05.060
<b>He asked me to give this to you

<b>The box that had been sealed with <i>Nen</i></b>

<b>contained three mysterious items.</b>

02:21.530 --> 02:25.930
<b>One of them, an old cassette tape,</b>

02:25.930 --> 02:28.250
<b>gave Gon his first chance</b>

02:28.250 --> 02:30.590
<b>to hear his father's voice.</b>

02:31.830 --> 02:33.790
<b><i>Yo, Gon...</i></b>

02:35.050 --> 02:37.700
<b><i>So you became a Hunter, too.</i></b>

02:38.370 --> 02:40.550
<b><i>This is my dad's voice.</i></b>

02:41.390 --> 02:44.680
<b><i>Anyway, I have a question for you.</i></b>

02:45.910 --> 02:49.030
<b><i>Do you want to see me?</i></b>

02:51.880 --> 02:54.820
<b><i>If you do, keep on listening.</i></b>

02:55.840 --> 02:59.510
<b><i>If you don't, press the stop button.</i></b>

03:07.030 --> 03:08.470
<b><i>I'm guessing that's a "yes."</i></b>

03:08.970 --> 03:11.460
<b><i>Then I'll ask you once more.</i></b>

03:12.490 --> 03:14.080
<b><i>Are you prepared?</i></b>

03:14.890 --> 03:17.680
<b><i>Hunters are selfish creatures.</i></b>

03:18.510 --> 03:22.470
<b><i>They're willing to sacrifice 
anything to get what they want.</i></b>

03:23.870 --> 03:26.290
<b><i>If you're only slightly interested in seeing me,</i></b>

03:26.290 --> 03:28.850
<b><i>you should stop the tape now.</i></b>

03:29.410 --> 03:30.900
<b><i>I'll give you a minute to consider it.</i></b>

03:32.360 --> 03:33.550
<b>Well?</b>

03:46.700 --> 03:48.830
<b><i>I guess you really do want to see me.</i></b>

03:49.470 --> 03:51.430
<b><i>But I don't want to see you.</i></b>

03:53.280 --> 03:56.020
<b><i>I don't know how I could face you now.</i></b>

03:56.930 --> 04:00.180
<b><i>After all, I chose my own desires</i></b>

04:00.180 --> 04:02.710
<b><i>over my parental duty.</i></b>

04:03.780 --> 04:04.970
<b><i>I'm a bad person.</i></b>

04:09.940 --> 04:14.730
<b><i>I'm guessing that by the time

04:14.730 --> 04:18.770
<b><i>at least ten years will have passed.</i></b>

04:20.650 --> 04:24.850
<b><i>But one thing still hasn't changed.</i></b>

04:29.730 --> 04:32.620
<b><i>I'm still me.</i></b>

04:33.930 --> 04:34.730
<b>Bo!</b>

04:47.720 --> 04:51.230
<b><i>As you listen to this tape,</i></b>

04:51.810 --> 04:53.960
<b><i>I'm off doing reckless things.</i></b>

04:55.700 --> 04:57.810
<b><i>If you want to see me, find me.</i></b>

04:58.480 --> 05:02.510
<b><i>But as I said before, I don't want to see you.</i></b>

05:03.090 --> 05:06.320
<b><i>If I sense you nearby, 
I'll make myself scarce.</i></b>

05:07.540 --> 05:08.960
<b><i>Catch me if you can.</i></b>

05:09.830 --> 05:11.820
<b><i>You are a Hunter, aren't you?</i></b>

05:19.150 --> 05:22.550
<b>Your dad isn't gonna be easy to track.</b>

05:22.550 --> 05:23.920
<b>Oh, wait...</b>

05:24.920 --> 05:26.870
<b>Ging's still there.</b>

05:28.150 --> 05:31.040
<b><i>Oh, I forgot to mention something...</i></b>

05:32.030 --> 05:34.600
<b><i>It's about your mother.</i></b>

05:36.340 --> 05:38.600
<b><i>If you want to know more, keep listening.</i></b>

05:39.150 --> 05:40.370
<b><i>If you're not interested...</i></b>

05:42.300 --> 05:43.800
<b>Are you sure?</b>

05:43.800 --> 05:44.860
<b>Yeah.</b>

05:44.860 --> 05:48.360
<b>But he might have left you a clue.</b>

05:48.580 --> 05:50.170
<b>I doubt it.</b>

05:50.730 --> 05:52.230
<b>That's what my gut tells me.</b>

05:53.150 --> 05:54.370
<b>Besides, I already told you...</b>

05:54.840 --> 05:57.000
<b>My mom is Mito-san.</b>

05:58.720 --> 05:59.940
<b>I see.</b>

06:06.340 --> 06:07.640
<b>Are you hungry?</b>

06:07.640 --> 06:09.020
<b>I'll go grab something.</b>

06:09.020 --> 06:09.990
<b>Yeah.</b>

06:16.260 --> 06:17.500
<b>Hey, Gon!</b>

06:17.500 --> 06:18.640
<b>The tape started moving</b>

06:18.640 --> 06:19.790
<b>all by itself!</b>

06:19.790 --> 06:20.600
<b>What?!</b>

06:21.380 --> 06:22.940
<b>There's aura around the tape player!</b>

06:22.940 --> 06:25.530
<b>It's <i>Nen</i>... 
<i>Nen</i> is rewinding the cassette!</b>

06:25.830 --> 06:27.250
<b><i>Nen</i> ?</b>

06:27.250 --> 06:29.030
<b>Is he nearby?</b>

06:29.030 --> 06:33.120
<b>No, he infused this player with 
<i>Nen</i> over ten years ago!</b>

06:33.120 --> 06:35.770
<b>So it would start rewinding, 
once it was stopped!</b>

06:35.770 --> 06:36.870
<b>Why?</b>

06:36.870 --> 06:38.040
<b>Beats me.</b>

06:40.900 --> 06:42.670
<b>Now it's recording!</b>

06:43.050 --> 06:45.560
<b>I get it! He's erasing his message!</b>

06:45.560 --> 06:46.670
<b>What?</b>

06:49.350 --> 06:50.100
<b>It's not working!</b>

06:50.100 --> 06:51.530
<b>I can't stop it...</b>

06:51.530 --> 06:52.620
<b>Damn!</b>

06:54.620 --> 06:56.180
<b>It still won't stop!</b>

06:56.180 --> 06:58.030
<b>I pulled the plug!</b>

06:58.770 --> 07:00.170
<b>Sorry, Gon.</b>

07:00.430 --> 07:01.570
<b>I'll have to break it!</b>

07:04.540 --> 07:05.850
<b>Damn!</b>

07:05.850 --> 07:06.900
<b>No good!</b>

07:06.900 --> 07:08.550
<b>There's <i>Nen</i> protecting the player!</b>

07:25.490 --> 07:27.330
<b>It's finished.</b>

07:36.990 --> 07:39.230
<b><i>Now it's recording!</i></b>

07:39.230 --> 07:41.680
<b><i>I get it! He's erasing his message!</i></b>

07:41.680 --> 07:42.740
<b><i>What?</i></b>

07:45.850 --> 07:49.480
<b>The other tape was also wiped.</b>

07:49.480 --> 07:52.320
<b>Why would he go to all this trouble?</b>

07:53.270 --> 07:56.340
<b>I'm guessing he didn't want to leave any clues.</b>

07:56.340 --> 07:57.720
<b>Clues?</b>

07:57.720 --> 08:00.940
<b>You can extract a lot of information 
from an audio clip.</b>

08:00.940 --> 08:01.830
<b>Really?</b>

08:01.830 --> 08:04.870
<b>You can determine the 
speaker's height, weight,</b>

08:04.870 --> 08:08.710
<b>gender, age, facial features, chronic diseases,</b>

08:08.710 --> 08:11.060
<b>and state of mind.</b>

08:12.930 --> 08:17.560
<b>From the background noise, 
you can also determine the location.</b>

08:17.560 --> 08:20.820
<b>But he was more worried 
about something else.</b>

08:20.820 --> 08:22.100
<b>Something else?</b>

08:23.220 --> 08:24.480
<b><i>Nen.</i></b>

08:26.590 --> 08:28.930
<b>I wouldn't be surprised if 
there were a <i>Nen</i> user</b>

08:28.930 --> 08:32.410
<b>somewhere who could analyze 
data better than a machine.</b>

08:33.240 --> 08:34.410
<b>Someone who would</b>

08:34.410 --> 08:37.550
<b>know everything about a person 
just from hearing their voice.</b>

08:38.170 --> 08:39.240
<b>Oh, I get it.</b>

08:40.050 --> 08:42.750
<b>Your dad's a tough nut.</b>

08:45.850 --> 08:49.160
<b>Since the tape's useless now,</b>

08:49.160 --> 08:51.360
<b>we only have two clues left...</b>

08:52.080 --> 08:54.460
<b>The ring and the memory card.</b>

08:54.460 --> 08:55.980
<b>I doubt the ring will help,</b>

08:55.980 --> 08:57.640
<b>but the memory card could be important.</b>

08:57.640 --> 09:00.780
<b>Yeah, it's smaller than a normal memory card.</b>

09:01.380 --> 09:03.640
<b>Maybe you need a special machine to use it?</b>

09:04.000 --> 09:06.480
<b>Huh? You can't tell?</b>

09:06.480 --> 09:09.150
<b>This memory card only works with the JS.</b>

09:09.150 --> 09:10.780
<b>The JS?</b>

09:10.780 --> 09:12.810
<b>A gaming console called the JoyStation.</b>

09:12.810 --> 09:14.150
<b>It's three generations old.</b>

09:14.660 --> 09:16.280
<b>You don't know anything, do you?</b>

09:17.010 --> 09:21.530
<b>If this island still has tape players, 
it probably has a console.</b>

09:22.040 --> 09:23.160
<b>Is there a toy store here?</b>

09:23.160 --> 09:25.090
<b>Yeah, there is.</b>

09:25.090 --> 09:26.800
<b>Okay, hold on.</b>

09:30.600 --> 09:32.300
<b>Oh, where are you going?</b>

09:32.300 --> 09:33.340
<b>The toy store.</b>

09:35.110 --> 09:37.360
<b>It's outside the port!</b>

09:37.360 --> 09:38.680
<b>Got it!</b>

09:39.820 --> 09:41.760
<b>Have a safe trip!</b>

09:57.460 --> 09:59.410
<b>So this is a JoyStation...</b>

09:59.740 --> 10:01.530
<b>This brings back memories.</b>

10:01.530 --> 10:03.140
<b>I used to play with these all the time.</b>

10:03.140 --> 10:05.410
<b>There were a bunch of hidden 
gems for this console.</b>

10:07.010 --> 10:09.610
<b>Then is this memory card 
one of those hidden gems?</b>

10:09.610 --> 10:12.290
<b>I don't see a title anywhere.</b>

10:12.570 --> 10:15.410
<b>You've never played any video games, have you?</b>

10:15.410 --> 10:16.800
<b>That's unusual.</b>

10:16.800 --> 10:17.920
<b>Really?</b>

10:17.920 --> 10:19.870
<b>That isn't a game disc.</b>

10:19.870 --> 10:22.290
<b>It holds a game's memory data.</b>

10:22.290 --> 10:24.680
<b>So you can't use it to play.</b>

10:24.680 --> 10:28.270
<b>Yeah, you're supposed to 
put the disc in here.</b>

10:28.270 --> 10:33.190
<b>But if you insert the memory card and 
power it on without a game inside,</b>

10:34.200 --> 10:37.550
<b>you can see which games are using that memory.</b>

10:37.550 --> 10:38.960
<b>Oh, really...</b>

10:40.770 --> 10:44.200
<b>It looks like there's only one game saved on it.</b>

10:44.680 --> 10:47.260
<b>It's called <i>Greed Island</i>.</b>

10:47.260 --> 10:49.210
<b><i>Greed Island?</i></b>

10:49.210 --> 10:52.490
<b>Anyway, there are a bunch of saves.</b>

10:52.490 --> 10:55.710
<b>I doubt it will do any good, 
but I'll copy the data just in case.</b>

10:57.700 --> 11:00.780
<b>Copying <i>Greed Island</i>.</b>

11:00.780 --> 11:01.470
<b>Okay.</b>

11:04.970 --> 11:06.440
<b>What are you doing?</b>

11:06.440 --> 11:07.530
<b>Searching on-line.</b>

11:07.530 --> 11:09.250
<b>We know the game's name.</b>

11:09.250 --> 11:11.140
<b>So I'm looking for a store that sells it.</b>

11:12.130 --> 11:13.360
<b>0 Matches</b>

11:13.550 --> 11:14.460
<b>What?</b>

11:14.460 --> 11:16.370
<b>Not a single match?</b>

11:16.370 --> 11:18.140
<b>Does that mean it's out of print?</b>

11:18.140 --> 11:20.620
<b>There aren't any used copies...</b>

11:20.620 --> 11:23.620
<b>An out-of-print game would still have 
some used copies floating around.</b>

11:25.100 --> 11:28.700
<b>It's possible that this game isn't for sale.</b>

11:28.700 --> 11:29.880
<b>What do you mean?</b>

11:29.880 --> 11:32.700
<b>It could be an indie game</b>

11:32.700 --> 11:38.130
<b>that was never for sale or was 
banned for some reason.</b>

11:39.310 --> 11:41.010
<b>Anyway, I'll keep searching.</b>

11:43.260 --> 11:44.300
<b>There we go.</b>

11:44.300 --> 11:47.830
<b>This game was sold through 
legitimate channels.</b>

11:47.830 --> 11:49.520
<b>"<i>Greed Island</i>.</b>

11:49.790 --> 11:52.750
<b>A hunting game for Hunters."</b>

11:53.550 --> 11:55.200
<b>For Hunters?</b>

11:55.740 --> 11:58.280
<b>And what's with that price tag?!</b>

11:58.360 --> 12:00.200
<b>Five hundred, eighty million?</b>

12:00.200 --> 12:02.080
<b>It's five billion, eight hundred million!</b>

12:02.080 --> 12:02.780
<b>Huh?</b>

12:03.150 --> 12:06.460
<b>That's ridiculous!</b>

12:06.460 --> 12:08.320
<b>Only a hundred copies were produced.</b>

12:08.320 --> 12:10.070
<b>That isn't very many.</b>

12:10.070 --> 12:11.760
<b>It's practically nothing!</b>

12:11.760 --> 12:13.060
<b>The developers were cocky...</b>

12:13.060 --> 12:14.290
<b>The number is way too low!</b>

12:15.140 --> 12:16.500
<b>But it makes sense.</b>

12:16.500 --> 12:20.020
<b>The price is ridiculous, 
but Hunters can afford it.</b>

12:20.020 --> 12:21.800
<b>That explains how they sold out.</b>

12:21.800 --> 12:24.980
<b>Do the makers have any left in stock?</b>

12:24.980 --> 12:27.990
<b>Yeah, I guess we could ask.</b>

12:29.770 --> 12:34.050
<b>The game you are inquiring about 
is no longer in stock.</b>

12:34.050 --> 12:37.930
<b>Unfortunately, there are no plans 
to print additional copies.</b>

12:37.930 --> 12:39.740
<b>I see, thanks.</b>

12:41.750 --> 12:43.510
<b>That's a no-go.</b>

12:44.830 --> 12:48.810
<b>I guess we'll have to find someone with 
a copy and ask them to let us have it.</b>

12:48.810 --> 12:52.300
<b>Yeah, our best bet is to advertise 
on a reverse auction website</b>

12:52.300 --> 12:55.330
<b>and wait for someone to offer to sell us a copy.</b>

12:55.610 --> 12:57.840
<b>But where will we get the money?</b>

12:58.360 --> 13:01.210
<b>If we pool our money from the arena,</b>

13:01.800 --> 13:03.110
<b>that's eight hundred million.</b>

13:03.920 --> 13:06.200
<b>Then we need another five billion...</b>

13:06.200 --> 13:07.630
<b>Not necessarily.</b>

13:07.630 --> 13:08.600
<b>Huh?</b>

13:08.830 --> 13:12.270
<b>With these private deals, 
the seller holds all the power.</b>

13:12.270 --> 13:15.620
<b>Typically, they'll ask for more 
than the original price.</b>

13:15.620 --> 13:17.720
<b>So it'll cost even more?</b>

13:17.720 --> 13:18.560
<b>Maybe.</b>

13:22.560 --> 13:26.220
<b>Well, we can post a want ad, just in case.</b>

13:26.220 --> 13:29.370
<b>Yeah, but I doubt anyone will click it.</b>

13:29.830 --> 13:34.500
<b>"Looking for the game <i>Greed Island</i>...</b>

<b>Wh-What?</b>

13:49.650 --> 13:52.830
<b>We already have over ten thousand hits!</b>

13:52.830 --> 13:54.090
<b>So that's it...</b>

13:54.090 --> 13:57.650
<b>They're trying to foist counterfeits off on us.</b>

13:57.650 --> 14:01.020
<b>That should have been obvious, 
considering the price.</b>

14:01.400 --> 14:02.850
<b>This plan is a wash.</b>

14:02.850 --> 14:06.030
<b>We can't examine every single offer.</b>

14:06.370 --> 14:11.080
<b>Besides, we can't even tell

14:11.080 --> 14:13.040
<b>Then what should we do?</b>

14:13.330 --> 14:18.080
<b>If we dig more deeply on-line, 
we might uncover more information.</b>

14:20.920 --> 14:25.180
<b>Is there anyone who knows a bunch 
about games and the Net?</b>

14:25.180 --> 14:28.860
<b>Oh, there's someone who 
knows a lot about both.</b>

14:28.860 --> 14:29.450
<b>Huh?</b>

14:29.450 --> 14:33.060
<b>He might even own a copy of <i>Greed Island</i>.</b>

14:33.060 --> 14:35.130
<b>What? Really?</b>

14:35.130 --> 14:38.020
<b>But I don't want to ask him...</b>

14:38.020 --> 14:39.440
<b>Who is it?</b>

14:41.600 --> 14:43.040
<b>Oh, Gotoh?</b>

14:43.040 --> 14:43.900
<b>It's Killua.</b>

14:44.250 --> 14:45.880
<b>Gotoh-san?</b>

14:48.610 --> 14:50.640
<b>Yeah, I'm doing fine.</b>

14:51.680 --> 14:52.560
<b>Right now?</b>

14:52.560 --> 14:53.940
<b>Who cares where I am?</b>

14:53.940 --> 14:56.660
<b>If I tell you, my mother might find out.</b>

14:57.020 --> 14:59.430
<b>Anyway, put Piggy on.</b>

14:59.680 --> 15:01.190
<b>Piggy?</b>

15:03.380 --> 15:04.320
<b>What?</b>

15:04.320 --> 15:06.050
<b>Killua wants to talk to me?</b>

15:06.050 --> 15:07.110
<b>Screw that!</b>

15:07.110 --> 15:09.050
<b>Tell him I'm not here.</b>

15:09.050 --> 15:10.440
<b>Don't lie!</b>

15:10.440 --> 15:12.730
<b>He never goes outside!</b>

15:12.730 --> 15:14.530
<b>Tell him if he doesn't answer</b>

15:14.530 --> 15:17.560
<b>the phone in ten seconds, 
I'll break all his figures!</b>

15:19.860 --> 15:22.290
<b>Fine, put him on.</b>

15:22.290 --> 15:23.430
<b>Hey, Kil...</b>

15:23.430 --> 15:27.500
<b>If you lay a finger on my 
collection, I'll kill you!</b>

15:27.500 --> 15:29.410
<b>I was just kidding, Bro.</b>

15:29.410 --> 15:31.320
<b>You don't have to get so mad.</b>

15:31.970 --> 15:33.170
<b>Bro?</b>

15:38.010 --> 15:40.220
<b>Well? What is it?</b>

15:40.220 --> 15:42.210
<b>I'm busy here.</b>

15:44.440 --> 15:46.280
<b><i>Greed Island</i> ?</b>

15:46.280 --> 15:47.740
<b>Yeah, I've heard of it.</b>

15:47.740 --> 15:52.340
<b>I never expected you to ask me 
about a super-rare game.</b>

15:52.630 --> 15:53.950
<b>You don't own a copy?</b>

15:53.950 --> 15:55.320
<b>No, I don't.</b>

15:55.690 --> 15:59.370
<b>I wanted one, but I was five 
when the game went on sale.</b>

15:59.370 --> 16:01.100
<b>So I didn't have any money.</b>

16:01.390 --> 16:05.940
<b>There were over twenty thousand 
requests for a hundred copies.</b>

16:08.300 --> 16:12.990
<b>Even though each copy cost five billion, 
eight hundred million Jenny in cash.</b>

16:13.390 --> 16:16.630
<b>I tried looking around later,</b>

16:16.630 --> 16:19.290
<b>but I couldn't even find an owner.</b>

16:19.290 --> 16:22.000
<b>It's a legendary game for all kinds of reasons.</b>

16:22.460 --> 16:23.680
<b>So what's up?</b>

16:23.680 --> 16:26.070
<b>Are you looking for a copy?</b>

16:26.070 --> 16:26.870
<b>Pretty much.</b>

16:26.870 --> 16:27.740
<b>It's impossible.</b>

16:27.740 --> 16:28.850
<b>Forget it.</b>

16:28.850 --> 16:30.930
<b>Even I had to give up.</b>

16:30.930 --> 16:31.970
<b>Oh?</b>

16:31.970 --> 16:35.140
<b>You gave up because it was 
beyond your ability?</b>

16:37.070 --> 16:38.620
<b>That was in the past.</b>

16:38.620 --> 16:41.230
<b>I have a lead now.</b>

16:41.230 --> 16:44.900
<b>But considering the amount 
of effort and money,</b>

16:44.900 --> 16:46.650
<b>it's not worth it.</b>

16:48.450 --> 16:51.980
<b>Ah, so tell me this lead you have.</b>

16:51.980 --> 16:54.790
<b>What? I won't tell you for free.</b>

16:54.790 --> 16:58.660
<b>Will you trade for a <i>Greed Island</i> memory card?</b>

17:00.110 --> 17:01.750
<b>What do you mean?</b>

17:01.750 --> 17:05.510
<b>I happened to get my hands 
on a memory card.</b>

17:05.510 --> 17:11.170
<b>You can probably decipher the data 
and recreate the game, right?</b>

17:11.170 --> 17:14.270
<b>Are you telling the truth?</b>

17:14.270 --> 17:17.520
<b>I don't lie when I make deals.</b>

17:20.060 --> 17:23.470
<b>Okay, I have two leads.</b>

17:23.470 --> 17:24.520
<b>Hold on...</b>

17:24.520 --> 17:26.060
<b>Don't say anything over the phone!</b>

17:26.060 --> 17:27.750
<b>Don't worry.</b>

17:27.750 --> 17:29.060
<b>This information</b>

17:29.060 --> 17:31.760
<b>won't help anyone who 
might be eavesdropping.</b>

17:31.760 --> 17:33.320
<b>The first lead is...</b>

17:33.880 --> 17:34.870
<b>Yeah.</b>

17:34.870 --> 17:36.940
<b>Yeah, I see.</b>

17:37.430 --> 17:38.850
<b>Okay, got it.</b>

17:38.850 --> 17:41.280
<b>I'll send you the memory card 
through the usual method.</b>

17:43.950 --> 17:44.920
<b>Sorry.</b>

17:44.920 --> 17:48.390
<b>I ended up trading the copy 
of the memory card.</b>

17:48.390 --> 17:50.050
<b>Sure, that's fine.</b>

17:50.050 --> 17:51.440
<b>It's just a copy.</b>

17:51.440 --> 17:54.590
<b>In return, I got two pieces 
of solid information.</b>

17:54.590 --> 17:57.860
<b>First, there's a website for Hunters,</b>

17:57.860 --> 18:00.180
<b>only accessible by Hunters.</b>

18:00.180 --> 18:03.290
<b>We can probably find leads 
on <i>Greed Island</i> there.</b>

18:03.290 --> 18:04.270
<b>Really?</b>

18:04.270 --> 18:06.720
<b>I'll have to use my Hunter License.</b>

18:07.330 --> 18:08.340
<b>Stupid!</b>

18:08.340 --> 18:12.200
<b>If you use your home computer, 
they'll know your address!</b>

18:12.200 --> 18:16.340
<b>You'll have bad guys who want your 
license showing up on the island!</b>

18:16.340 --> 18:17.860
<b>Oh, that's right...</b>

18:18.520 --> 18:22.060
<b>You have to use public computers 
for this stuff...</b>

18:22.060 --> 18:24.240
<b>In a hotel or a Net café.</b>

18:24.540 --> 18:28.330
<b>Well, I still don't know the address.</b>

18:28.330 --> 18:31.750
<b>My brother promised to tell me, 
once he's received the memory card.</b>

18:32.220 --> 18:35.880
<b>The second lead is the auction 
in Yorknew City.</b>

18:35.880 --> 18:36.960
<b>What?</b>

18:36.960 --> 18:38.880
<b>Isn't Yorknew City...</b>

18:39.350 --> 18:43.420
<b>Yes, the place where we're supposed 
to meet Kurapika and Leorio.</b>

18:43.420 --> 18:47.520
<b>In September, the city will host 
the world's greatest auction.</b>

18:48.200 --> 18:51.470
<b>My brother said it's probably a hoax, 
but there's a rumor</b>

18:51.470 --> 18:55.690
<b>that someone will distribute 
dozens of copies at the auction.</b>

18:56.440 --> 18:59.530
<b>Maybe that someone is Ging.</b>

18:59.920 --> 19:03.690
<b>Yeah, that theory makes the 
rumor more credible.</b>

19:04.180 --> 19:07.550
<b>We'll need a crazy amount of 
money to buy a copy.</b>

19:08.160 --> 19:09.500
<b>That's right...</b>

19:11.070 --> 19:16.160
<b><i>I guess it really was our destiny 
to go to Yorknew City.</i></b>

19:40.320 --> 19:44.810
<b>Battera, the tycoon, is offering 
seventeen billion for the game,</b>

19:44.810 --> 19:49.560
<b>and fifty billion for a memory card 
with a complete saved game.</b>

19:50.290 --> 19:52.210
<b>This is truly legendary.</b>

19:53.700 --> 19:55.210
<b>Amusing.</b>

19:57.530 --> 20:00.720
<b>I'm going to end this legend...</b>

20:01.700 --> 20:03.190
<b>Wow...</b>

20:04.000 --> 20:05.880
<b>There's so much food!</b>

20:05.880 --> 20:06.970
<b>Is something special happening?</b>

20:07.400 --> 20:10.230
<b>You won't be back for a while, right?</b>

20:12.610 --> 20:13.810
<b>Mito-san...</b>

20:14.570 --> 20:17.680
<b>Who knows when your next 
chance to eat will be?</b>

20:17.680 --> 20:19.590
<b>Fill up now.</b>

20:22.000 --> 20:23.160
<b>Yeah!</b>

20:30.470 --> 20:33.590
<b>Let's eat!</b>

20:56.440 --> 20:57.820
<b>Mito-san!</b>

20:58.440 --> 21:01.750
<b>I'm going to find Ging!</b>

21:02.320 --> 21:06.780
<b>After I've met Ging, I'll return to the island.</b>

21:10.050 --> 21:13.500
<b>Take care of yourself until then!</b>

21:32.730 --> 21:38.310
<b>Ging told Gon to find him, 
leaving behind a riddle.</b>

21:39.120 --> 21:43.270
<b>In order to solve that riddle 
and meet his father,</b>

21:43.270 --> 21:49.740
<b>Gon leaves his home again and heads 
to Yorknew City with Killua.</b>

23:01.150 --> 23:06.190
<b>Brush Your Teeth. 
Unripe Fruit</b>

23:01.150 --> 23:06.610
<b>Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia</b>

23:01.400 --> 23:02.950
<b>Coming up, we have Gon</b>

23:02.950 --> 23:03.650
<b>and Killua's</b>

23:03.650 --> 23:05.300
<b>Hunterpedia!</b>

23:06.620 --> 23:07.470
<b>It's Gon</b>

23:07.470 --> 23:08.320
<b>and Killua's</b>

23:08.320 --> 23:09.610
<b>Hunterpedia!</b>

23:08.780 --> 23:19.670
<b>Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia</b>

23:09.610 --> 23:11.390
<b>Today, we introduce Ging!</b>

23:11.390 --> 23:13.840
<b>I became a Hunter to find my dad.</b>

23:11.590 --> 23:13.830
<b>Gon's dad, 
a Double Star Hunter.</b>

23:13.830 --> 23:16.540
<b>He left a message 
box with Mito,</b>

23:13.840 --> 23:16.510
<b>By the way, what does your dad want?</b>

23:16.510 --> 23:19.750
<b>I'm going to find my dad and ask him!</b>

23:16.530 --> 23:19.940
<b>to give Gon after he 
became a Hunter.</b>

23:24.930 --> 23:27.320
<b>Next time: Wish x And x Promise!</b>

23:27.320 --> 23:29.340
<b>Go to sleep, or you'll be late.</b>

23:29.340 --> 23:32.090
<b>I don't need to sleep.</b>

23:32.090 --> 23:34.680
<b>You should all get plenty of sleep.</b>
