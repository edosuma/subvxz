01:15.462 --> 01:16.696
Fuck!

01:31.244 --> 01:33.646
Okay, I've got ten numbers,
four spots.

01:33.648 --> 01:35.314
I need a four-digit code.

01:38.019 --> 01:39.719
No, no, no.

01:39.721 --> 01:41.155
Shit! What now?

01:46.361 --> 01:47.662
Shit.

01:48.663 --> 01:50.463
Jesus Christ.

01:50.465 --> 01:52.565
Clues.

01:52.567 --> 01:54.235
Shit. Okay.

01:55.402 --> 01:57.405
That's nothing.

01:59.539 --> 02:01.773
"Follow the light
to greener pastures."

02:01.775 --> 02:05.011
What does that mean?
What does that mean?

02:05.013 --> 02:06.447
Light? What light?

02:10.883 --> 02:13.319
Light. Follow the light.

02:13.321 --> 02:15.521
Green. Green book, yeah.

02:15.523 --> 02:17.892
Greener pastures.
Okay. Yeah, all right.

02:33.074 --> 02:33.976
Oh!

02:35.642 --> 02:38.377
"At any point in history,
to watch another die,

02:38.379 --> 02:41.415
unveils time's great mystery,
while leaving you alive."

02:41.417 --> 02:43.914
Time. Time.
Some kind of clock.

02:43.916 --> 02:44.953
Shit.

02:46.285 --> 02:47.520
Where's the clock?

02:47.522 --> 02:48.891
I don't see a goddamn clock!

02:52.858 --> 02:56.096
"To watch another person die."
Yeah. Okay, yeah.

02:58.732 --> 03:01.133
"To watch another person die."

03:01.135 --> 03:02.568
Oh, shit!

03:04.404 --> 03:07.840
Okay.
They're pointing! Let's see.

03:07.842 --> 03:10.742
It's time.
It's hands on a clock. Yeah.

03:10.744 --> 03:13.412
That one's four! Four o'clock!

03:13.414 --> 03:14.713
Eight.

03:14.715 --> 03:16.313
Six!

03:16.315 --> 03:18.685
Two! That's the number,
that's the code!

03:20.487 --> 03:24.089
Okay. Where's the four?
Shit. Come on.

03:24.091 --> 03:26.959
All right. Okay. Yeah, good.

03:26.961 --> 03:29.298
Come on, come on! Eight!

03:30.932 --> 03:31.833
Six.

03:34.302 --> 03:35.501
Oh, my God.

03:35.503 --> 03:38.336
Where's the...?
Six, six, six!

03:38.338 --> 03:39.506
Oh, God!

03:41.509 --> 03:44.509
Two, two! Yeah. Okay. Come on.

03:44.511 --> 03:45.680
Come on.

03:47.850 --> 03:51.117
Come on! Why isn't it working?

03:51.119 --> 03:52.450
Oh, shit.

03:55.290 --> 03:56.624
Come on.

03:58.725 --> 04:01.261
Open! Come on, open!

04:06.133 --> 04:08.333
Oh, God, there's no way out!

04:14.775 --> 04:17.442
Please get me out!

04:17.444 --> 04:19.310
Shit! No!

04:19.314 --> 04:21.011
No!

04:59.887 --> 05:02.021
<i>Has anyone
ever heard the saying,</i>

05:02.023 --> 05:03.688
<i>"A watched pot never boils"?</i>

05:03.690 --> 05:06.958
Well, on a quantum scale,
that may actually be true.

05:06.960 --> 05:09.963
Does anyone know
what the quantum Zeno effect is?

05:11.231 --> 05:13.932
Wow, guys, not all at once now.

05:22.376 --> 05:24.443
Well, it may well be

05:24.445 --> 05:27.445
one of the oddest things
in quantum physics.

05:27.447 --> 05:32.082
Simply put,
observation stops movement.

05:32.084 --> 05:34.253
Atoms won't change
while you watch them.

05:37.324 --> 05:39.258
All right,
that's all the time we have.

05:39.260 --> 05:41.494
Have a good holiday.
See you after the break.

05:41.496 --> 05:43.663
Happy Thanksgiving.

05:46.633 --> 05:49.633
Zoey, can I talk to you
for a minute?

05:49.635 --> 05:52.436
I read your paper
on the quantum Zeno effect.

05:52.438 --> 05:54.106
So, you want to be heard.

05:54.108 --> 05:55.741
You want to share
what you know,

05:55.743 --> 05:57.980
but only in the safety
of your own dorm room?

05:59.113 --> 06:01.912
I'll try and speak up more.

06:01.914 --> 06:04.516
It might seem like reducing
the number of variables

06:04.518 --> 06:06.450
in your life will control
the outcome,

06:06.452 --> 06:08.988
but life isn't
a science experiment.

06:08.990 --> 06:11.489
You can't contain
your world forever.

06:11.491 --> 06:13.691
Try doing one thing
that scares you

06:13.694 --> 06:15.360
over break, okay?

06:15.362 --> 06:16.830
Okay.

06:28.241 --> 06:29.941
<i>Ray, it's Jason. Listen.</i>

06:29.943 --> 06:32.345
You want to buy a boat
by retirement, right?

06:32.347 --> 06:34.547
Well, keep focusing
on these low-beta stocks,

06:34.549 --> 06:36.948
and it's going to be a rowboat
with rented oars.

06:36.950 --> 06:38.517
By the end
of the first quarter,

06:38.519 --> 06:40.185
the market's going to see
a 10-percent return,

06:40.187 --> 06:42.389
while you'll be
sailing away with 30.

06:43.690 --> 06:45.725
Uh-huh.

06:45.727 --> 06:48.426
Hey, you won't regret it.

06:48.428 --> 06:51.930
I must be like the Mr. Miyagi
of trading to you, Charlie.

06:51.932 --> 06:53.365
"Mr...?"

06:53.367 --> 06:54.833
Jesus Christ, kid,
what year were you born?

06:54.835 --> 06:56.433
He's this wise,
old Japanese man

06:56.435 --> 06:59.503
who taught a kid karate
so he could beat up other kids.

06:59.505 --> 07:01.138
Mr. Ackerman for you
on line one.

07:01.140 --> 07:02.876
100 bucks says
I'm getting a gift.

07:04.578 --> 07:08.347
Congratulations, Mr. Ackerman.
Are you celebrating?

07:08.349 --> 07:11.816
Well, thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Ackerman.

07:11.818 --> 07:14.188
No. No, no, no,
I couldn't accept a gift.

07:15.689 --> 07:16.921
Uh-huh.

07:16.923 --> 07:19.391
A private jet. To Tahiti?

07:19.393 --> 07:21.460
Wow.

07:21.462 --> 07:23.663
Your home there. Uh-huh.

07:23.665 --> 07:25.032
Heh.

07:26.501 --> 07:29.167
Now, that sounds
like a hell of a weekend.

07:29.169 --> 07:32.804
<i>Man who catch fly

07:35.743 --> 07:37.812
<i>You, beginner luck.</i>

07:42.082 --> 07:44.617
<i>Wax on, wax off.</i>

07:44.619 --> 07:47.085
Hey, Gary.
I, uh...

07:47.087 --> 07:49.788
I heard there was...

07:49.790 --> 07:53.224
an opening up front
at checkout.

07:53.226 --> 07:56.193
I could use the bump.

07:56.195 --> 07:58.163
I'm trying to move out
of my mom's.

07:58.165 --> 08:00.266
It's starting to cramp
her style.

08:00.268 --> 08:02.200
Look, I feel for you, kid.

08:02.202 --> 08:04.273
I really do.
You know, I do.

08:06.106 --> 08:09.444
It's just putting you out front
would be bad for business.

08:13.212 --> 08:14.282
Yeah.

08:16.116 --> 08:18.416
Yeah, I'm not cut out for

08:18.418 --> 08:20.955
customer service
shit anyhow, so...

08:23.924 --> 08:25.294
Ben...

08:27.027 --> 08:29.631
you've got to find
healthier ways to unwind.

08:31.266 --> 08:33.767
Go outside, make a friend.

08:35.868 --> 08:39.236
- I didn't mean to...
- It's fine, it's fine. Sorry.

08:40.842 --> 08:42.809
Yeah. Thanks, Gary.

08:50.651 --> 08:52.618
A messenger dropped this off
for you.

08:52.620 --> 08:54.119
It's from Mr. Ackerman.

08:54.121 --> 08:55.619
Of course it is.

08:55.621 --> 08:57.124
This better be keys
to a Tesla.

09:04.463 --> 09:06.900
"For always thinking
outside the box."

09:10.304 --> 09:12.570
Well, it seems like
Mr. Ackerman has graduated

09:12.572 --> 09:16.644
from sending single malts
to boxes that don't open.

09:18.346 --> 09:21.112
Yeah. Rich people are weird.

09:21.114 --> 09:23.080
Money can't buy you
happiness.

09:23.082 --> 09:25.685
You better afford your own brand
of misery, Charlie.

09:25.687 --> 09:29.621
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Whatever. I'll be in tomorrow.

09:33.593 --> 09:35.859
<i>♪ They say sleep
Is the cousin of death ♪</i>

09:35.861 --> 09:38.195
<i>Hey, offer still stands.</i>

09:38.197 --> 09:39.632
Are you sure
you don't want to come

09:39.634 --> 09:40.999
to my family's
for Thanksgiving?

09:41.001 --> 09:42.701
Thank you, but, you know,

09:42.703 --> 09:44.803
big family dinners
aren't really my thing.

09:44.805 --> 09:46.339
Okay.

09:49.875 --> 09:52.978
You know, I'm really psyched
about having time to myself.

09:52.981 --> 09:54.678
I've been wanting
to take a stab

09:54.680 --> 09:57.984
at one of those cuboid
conjectures for, like, forever.

09:57.986 --> 09:59.750
It's really cool, actually.

09:59.752 --> 10:01.320
They claim irreducibility

10:01.322 --> 10:03.388
of three univariate
polynomials

10:03.390 --> 10:06.359
with integer coefficients
and if that is true,

10:06.361 --> 10:10.527
then Euler's concept
of a perfect box can't exist.

10:10.529 --> 10:12.265
Wow.

10:16.203 --> 10:20.373
You know, sometimes I wonder
if you just make up words

10:20.375 --> 10:22.806
because you know
I won't Google them.

10:45.097 --> 10:46.931
Not again.

11:03.384 --> 11:04.984
Are you okay?

11:04.986 --> 11:06.584
Yeah, I'm sorry.

11:06.586 --> 11:09.490
Well, I'm out of here.

11:10.457 --> 11:11.959
Okay.

11:26.606 --> 11:29.274
Hey, this is for you.

11:29.276 --> 11:32.911
It's from your professor.

11:32.913 --> 11:35.113
- Oh.
- Wait.

11:35.115 --> 11:37.114
You guys aren't doing it,
are you?

11:38.318 --> 11:40.385
What? No.

11:40.387 --> 11:43.421
Well, have fun
playing with your...

11:43.423 --> 11:44.524
box.

11:46.261 --> 11:47.962
Bye, Allison.

11:49.795 --> 11:50.998
Bye.

11:58.006 --> 11:59.707
"Open new doors."

12:29.369 --> 12:31.539
"A chance to escape."

13:08.342 --> 13:11.076
<i>Remember,
the puzzle box is intuitive.</i>

13:11.078 --> 13:12.646
<i>You don't want to force it.</i>

13:27.059 --> 13:29.261
Snap, crackle, and...

13:30.864 --> 13:31.798
Heh.

13:35.268 --> 13:38.004
I hate you.

13:41.208 --> 13:44.408
Give this to the guy
that failed eighth grade math.

13:44.410 --> 13:46.113
Great idea, Gary.

13:48.750 --> 13:50.751
This is the biggest waste of...

13:56.154 --> 14:00.458
"This serves as an entry voucher
for Minos Escape Rooms."

14:00.460 --> 14:03.094

14:35.996 --> 14:37.629
Hi.

14:37.631 --> 14:40.264
This is the Minos building?

14:40.266 --> 14:42.337
- I think so.
- Thanks.

14:47.641 --> 14:50.011
Yeah, it's going to kill me,
I know.

14:53.180 --> 14:54.546
Hi.

14:54.548 --> 14:56.281
Yeah. I'm here
for the escape room.

14:56.283 --> 14:57.317
ID please.

15:03.724 --> 15:04.658
Thanks.

15:11.164 --> 15:14.132
- Most guys buy me dinner first.
- I need to collect your phone.

15:14.134 --> 15:15.532
Really? Why?

15:15.534 --> 15:17.167
You can't be Twittering pictures
of the puzzles.

15:17.169 --> 15:20.206
- Okay.
- Third floor.

15:20.208 --> 15:21.708
Okay, thanks.

15:22.843 --> 15:24.845
Thank you for your service.

15:32.487 --> 15:33.886
Hold the door, please.

15:42.629 --> 15:44.162
I always sneak in
a second one.

15:44.164 --> 15:47.235
- The waiting rooms can get so boring.
- Mm.

15:57.275 --> 15:58.745
Yes!

16:12.958 --> 16:16.127
Please have a seat.
Someone will be with you shortly.

16:16.129 --> 16:17.629
Okay, thanks.

16:17.631 --> 16:19.596
Quite the welcome
wagon, isn't she?

16:19.598 --> 16:21.366
Super friendly. Heh.

16:21.368 --> 16:23.903
- Hey, Michael. Mike.
- Amanda.

16:23.905 --> 16:26.037
- Your name's Amanda?
- Yeah.

16:26.039 --> 16:27.538
- Isn't that funny?
- What?

16:27.540 --> 16:29.673
I had a family dog growing up
named Amanda.

16:29.675 --> 16:31.575
She was a cute,
little husky-collie.

16:31.577 --> 16:32.844
Two different colored eyes,
actually.

16:32.846 --> 16:33.844
It was very unique. Yeah.

16:33.846 --> 16:35.245
Cool.

16:35.247 --> 16:38.715
Yeah, she was cool.
Yeah, and then she died.

16:38.718 --> 16:40.685
You know, dogs die.

16:48.894 --> 16:51.395
Hitchhiking accident.

16:51.397 --> 16:53.198
Can you still play
video games?

16:53.200 --> 16:55.800
No. No, man.
Unfortunately I can't,

16:55.802 --> 16:59.304
so I just have sex with
adult women to fill the time.

16:59.306 --> 17:02.376
- Heh. Okay.
- Yeah.

17:07.512 --> 17:09.180
Uh...

17:09.182 --> 17:10.615
Sorry. Hi.

17:10.617 --> 17:12.983
- Hi.
- Do I know you?

17:12.986 --> 17:15.486
No, I don't think so.

17:15.488 --> 17:18.255
Really? You look
really familiar to me.

17:18.257 --> 17:20.661
You're not on TV
or something, are you?

17:25.300 --> 17:28.165
Well, this is going to suck.
Hi.

17:28.167 --> 17:29.871
Hey.

17:33.240 --> 17:34.672
Sign-in sheet?

17:34.675 --> 17:36.573
Yeah, don't bother.
She's preoccupied.

17:36.575 --> 17:37.679
How are you doing?
Mike.

17:39.111 --> 17:40.346
- Ben.
- Ben.

17:40.348 --> 17:42.178
I'm guessing you got
a box too, huh?

17:42.180 --> 17:43.747
Yeah.

17:43.749 --> 17:45.583
Did it take
you long to open it?

17:45.585 --> 17:47.687
It didn't take me too long.

17:47.689 --> 17:49.522
Yeah, we all got boxes.

17:49.524 --> 17:51.225
Opening it was the easy part.

17:53.427 --> 17:55.859
So, the website for
this place made the games

17:55.861 --> 17:57.529
look pretty fun, huh?

17:57.531 --> 18:00.197
Yeah. They're basically
like real-life video games.

18:00.199 --> 18:01.733
- Really?
- So, you've done

18:01.735 --> 18:03.234
one of these before.

18:03.236 --> 18:06.036
I've done 93 rooms.
Yeah, all the big ones.

18:06.038 --> 18:08.806
Panic Room, Enigma,
Basement...

18:08.808 --> 18:12.843
Breakout, Break In, Lock In.
Lock Down, of course.

18:12.845 --> 18:15.915
I've done all the bunkers:
World War One, World War Two...

18:15.917 --> 18:18.416
Cold War,
Cold War Two: Pol Pot's Revenge.

18:18.418 --> 18:20.350
Uh...

18:20.353 --> 18:21.919
What about you guys?

18:21.921 --> 18:23.655
You must be really good
at these, huh?

18:23.657 --> 18:25.090
Yeah. I'm pretty good.

18:25.092 --> 18:26.690
It's not cool.

18:26.692 --> 18:28.525
Yeah. You know,
my nephew's like you.

18:28.527 --> 18:30.028
He's completely obsessed.
He burns through

18:30.030 --> 18:32.163
all of his allowance money
on escape rooms.

18:32.165 --> 18:33.665
He's the reason why I'm here.
He signed me up.

18:33.667 --> 18:35.800
And apparently this room
was rated

18:35.802 --> 18:37.968
one of the top in the country
on some chat room.

18:37.970 --> 18:39.536
Yeah.

18:39.538 --> 18:41.405
My weirdo rich client
gave this to me as a gift.

18:41.407 --> 18:42.841
It felt mandatory.

18:42.843 --> 18:44.809
Yeah, paying people
to lock me in a room

18:44.811 --> 18:46.811
never seemed
too appealing to me.

18:46.813 --> 18:48.646
Yeah? What changed your mind?

18:48.649 --> 18:52.516
- Ha, ha. Uh...$10,000.
- Yeah, me too.

18:52.518 --> 18:55.019
That is a big chunk of change
in my book, you know?

18:55.022 --> 18:56.854
Yeah. I've been driving
an 18-wheeler

18:56.856 --> 18:58.690
since I had this injury
a while back,

18:58.692 --> 19:01.725
and I've been reading
about these self-driving cars.

19:01.727 --> 19:04.262
And I heard that
the trucking industry's

19:04.264 --> 19:05.728
going to be the first one to get
automated,

19:05.730 --> 19:07.966
so I'm trying to just squirrel
away a few nuts

19:07.968 --> 19:09.899
before the robots
come to get me.

19:09.901 --> 19:12.436
- That was a real buzzkill, man.
- It's just my life.

19:12.438 --> 19:14.406
This one's got
to be really insane

19:14.408 --> 19:16.140
for there to be a cash prize.
The website said

19:16.142 --> 19:17.640
no one's been able
to escape it yet.

19:17.642 --> 19:19.444
If we're able to do that,
we're going to have

19:19.446 --> 19:20.945
so much street cred.
You have no idea.

19:20.948 --> 19:22.982
Are there rules and regulations?
What?

19:22.984 --> 19:25.251
You just have to escape
before the clock runs out.

19:25.253 --> 19:26.817
Well,
what happens if you don't?

19:26.819 --> 19:28.285
Some guy comes in
through the door

19:28.287 --> 19:29.888
and explains all the clues
you missed.

19:29.890 --> 19:32.122
He makes you feel
like a total idiot.

19:32.124 --> 19:33.456
When does the game start?

19:33.458 --> 19:35.193
We are waiting
for the Games Master

19:35.195 --> 19:36.794
to come in to give us
the story

19:36.796 --> 19:38.596
and take us to the escape room.

19:38.598 --> 19:40.397
Like, it's a zombie apocalypse
and we have to find

19:40.399 --> 19:41.933
the cure
before we get eaten alive.

19:41.935 --> 19:43.466
I like that one.
That one sounds good.

19:43.468 --> 19:46.371
While the Games Master is
looking for a parking spot,

19:46.373 --> 19:48.442
I'm going to go smoke
a cigarette.

19:56.816 --> 19:57.750
Oh.

20:00.454 --> 20:02.122
Shit. Um...

20:04.857 --> 20:06.526
Hey, the doorknob came off.

20:07.995 --> 20:11.361
- What, you broke it?
- Of course he did.

20:11.364 --> 20:13.429
I didn't break it, it broke.

20:13.431 --> 20:15.500
Is that how you open a door
in your house?

20:15.502 --> 20:18.435
- No.
- Well, don't be so rough with it.

20:18.437 --> 20:19.839
Well, excuse me, miss.
Ma'am.

20:19.841 --> 20:21.539
Oh, my God,
this is awesome.

20:21.541 --> 20:25.310
You guys, you guys,
I think this is the escape room.

20:25.312 --> 20:26.977
What?

20:26.979 --> 20:28.612
Wait, what?

20:28.614 --> 20:31.182
Okay, it looks like
an oven dial, which means

20:31.184 --> 20:32.817
it's probably
a combination lock.

20:32.819 --> 20:34.151
All right,
everyone search the room.

20:34.153 --> 20:35.519
Wait, wait.
It's starting right now?

20:35.521 --> 20:36.854
- Yes.
- Oh!

20:36.856 --> 20:38.591
What are we looking for here,
bud?

20:38.593 --> 20:41.024
Anything that looks
like a puzzle or a code.

20:41.027 --> 20:44.763
Numbers are very important.
It could be anything, anywhere.

20:44.765 --> 20:46.297
Maybe under here.

20:46.300 --> 20:48.967
Do you want me
to hold on to this or is it...?

20:48.969 --> 20:51.405
Yeah, just hold your knob
there, guy.

20:52.672 --> 20:55.706
Great. Very funny. Yeah.

21:25.171 --> 21:26.771
Hey, guys.

21:26.773 --> 21:28.839
Hey, guys,
these are all addressed

21:28.841 --> 21:31.609
to the same guy,
this Dr. Wootan Yu.

21:31.612 --> 21:33.677
I mean, that's got to be
a clue, right?

21:33.679 --> 21:35.446
Maybe that's the story.

21:35.448 --> 21:37.382
Maybe he's like
an evil scientist

21:37.384 --> 21:38.683
and we have to escape
his lab

21:38.685 --> 21:40.217
before he sews us all together

21:40.219 --> 21:42.087
into some sort
of medical abomination.

21:42.089 --> 21:44.389
So,
his evil lab has a waiting room?

21:44.391 --> 21:46.323
- Yeah.
- No.

21:46.325 --> 21:48.259
Shit. Shit, shit.

21:48.261 --> 21:50.195
Guys, look, look.
I found a star-head screwdriver.

21:50.197 --> 21:52.230
That's got to be something,
right?

21:52.232 --> 21:54.599
Great.
So, we're looking for screws?

21:54.601 --> 21:56.969
Well, this isn't a hammer.

21:58.839 --> 22:01.772
- That's a star-head, right?
- I think so. Yeah.

22:01.774 --> 22:03.742
That's <i>Fahrenheit 451.</i>

22:03.744 --> 22:04.778
Oh.

22:06.580 --> 22:08.946
All right,
she's got something.

22:13.619 --> 22:15.653
- What was that?
- I don't know.

22:15.656 --> 22:17.658
Did that do anything?

22:21.259 --> 22:23.962
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

22:23.964 --> 22:25.496
Okay.

22:25.498 --> 22:27.966
- All right, now that's pretty cool.
- Yeah.

22:27.968 --> 22:30.000
Anybody got
suntan lotion?

22:30.002 --> 22:31.770
What did you just do?

22:31.772 --> 22:33.737
I just thought the book was
the code for the oven dial.

22:33.739 --> 22:35.473
Turn it off, please.

22:35.475 --> 22:36.741
Wow, it's really throwing off
some heat.

22:36.743 --> 22:38.009
Yeah, it's warm.

22:38.011 --> 22:39.543
It's kicking some heat.

22:39.545 --> 22:41.044
What are those,
giant oven coils?

22:41.047 --> 22:42.745
- Turn it off.
- I'm sorry. It's stuck.

22:42.747 --> 22:44.081
I can't move it.

22:44.083 --> 22:46.619
- Shit.
- This is crazy hot.

22:46.621 --> 22:50.320
- Can you shut it off?
- Shit. Okay.

22:50.323 --> 22:53.090
Don't touch anything else,
okay?

22:53.092 --> 22:55.126
Hey, you, gamer boy, there.

22:55.128 --> 22:56.794
What do we do?
How do we get out of here?

22:56.796 --> 22:58.763
When you're stuck,
you can ask for a hint.

22:58.765 --> 23:02.167
A hint? That's an option?
Okay, great. Here we go.

23:02.169 --> 23:04.069
Yeah, but it's way more fun
if we do it ourselves.

23:04.071 --> 23:05.270
Good one, gamer boy.

23:05.272 --> 23:06.437
I kind of want to do it
ourselves.

23:06.439 --> 23:08.173
Hi, excuse me.

23:08.175 --> 23:11.340
- We'd like our hint now, please.
- Yeah, hello.

23:11.342 --> 23:14.279
Please have a seat.
Someone will be with you shortly.

23:14.281 --> 23:17.113
No, yeah, excuse me, we'd really
like our hint, please.

23:17.115 --> 23:20.518
Please have a seat.
Someone will be with you shortly.

23:20.520 --> 23:22.589
- She said that last time.
- So?

23:24.322 --> 23:27.859
She said it the exact same way.
Same cadence, same tone.

23:27.861 --> 23:30.895
Well, the actors they hire
aren't exactly Dame Judi Dench.

23:30.897 --> 23:33.831
- Hello? Hello?
- I love Judi Dench.

23:36.502 --> 23:39.906
Yeah, I don't think the
snow globe's going to help, man.

23:46.479 --> 23:48.145
Hey. Uh...

23:48.147 --> 23:49.980
Hey, guys,
there's a lock over here.

23:49.982 --> 23:52.817
Yes. Locks are a super important
part of escape rooms.

23:52.819 --> 23:54.218
All right.

23:54.220 --> 23:56.154
Okay, it looks like
we need a small key

23:56.156 --> 23:57.956
to get to the other side
of the partition.

23:57.958 --> 23:59.957
That's probably
where the next clue is.

23:59.959 --> 24:01.358
Well,
I'm not going to be any help there

24:01.360 --> 24:03.660
because I can never
find my keys.

24:05.165 --> 24:07.699
Hilarious.
Or we could just break it off.

24:07.701 --> 24:09.032
There's an extinguisher
right here.

24:09.035 --> 24:10.235
Yeah, good idea.

24:10.237 --> 24:11.869
No, no. We shouldn't
have to use force.

24:11.871 --> 24:14.839
That's actually the one rule
I forgot to tell you. My bad.

24:14.841 --> 24:16.374
- Good one.
- Great.

24:16.376 --> 24:17.775
You're really good
at breaking stuff, huh?

24:17.777 --> 24:18.712
It's plastic.

24:23.082 --> 24:24.416
What was that?

24:24.418 --> 24:26.784
That's that same sound, right?

24:26.786 --> 24:28.786
Man,
what the hell did you just do?

24:28.788 --> 24:30.286
Oh! Oh.

24:30.288 --> 24:31.424
Oh, shit.

24:33.592 --> 24:35.894
Oh, shit, that looks real.

24:35.896 --> 24:37.761
They're just trying
to give us a scare

24:37.763 --> 24:39.763
as part of
the immersive experience.

24:39.765 --> 24:41.533
What the hell,
are they paying you?

24:41.535 --> 24:43.134
No, I just know how to have
fun, I guess.

24:43.136 --> 24:44.735
Heat stroke is your idea
of fun?

24:44.737 --> 24:46.203
It's getting warm.

24:46.205 --> 24:48.439
Hey, it's not that bad.
Just take off your jacket.

24:48.441 --> 24:50.409
Hey, does anyone else
have a problem with this?

24:52.511 --> 24:55.044
Hey, guys,
I think I've got the key.

24:55.046 --> 24:57.014
Whoa, hey, there.
Listen, short stuff...

24:57.016 --> 24:58.949
let's talk about this
before you bring tiki torches

24:58.951 --> 25:01.584
- out of the walls, okay?
- Hold on now. She's got a key.

25:01.586 --> 25:03.954
Why don't we stick it
in the keyhole?

25:03.956 --> 25:06.791
Okay, yeah. My bad.
Let's try it.

25:06.793 --> 25:07.928
Give it a shot, come on.

25:17.270 --> 25:21.003
<i>Please have a seat.
Someone will be with you shortly.</i>

25:21.005 --> 25:23.272
Well, that's creepy as hell.

25:34.120 --> 25:36.489
Fine. Yeah.
I'll get it. Move.

25:40.359 --> 25:41.792
Hello.

25:41.794 --> 25:43.494
<i>Welcome to Minos,</i>

25:43.496 --> 25:45.863
<i>the world's preeminent designer

25:45.865 --> 25:47.498
<i>To get the most
out of your game,</i>

25:47.500 --> 25:50.002
<i>we recommend following
all posted rules.</i>

25:50.937 --> 25:53.504
Hey. Hey. Hello? Hello?

25:53.506 --> 25:55.139
Who was it? What did they say?

25:55.141 --> 25:56.473
It was a recording.

25:56.475 --> 25:58.742
It said to follow
all the posted rules.

25:58.744 --> 25:59.880
What posted rules?

26:01.981 --> 26:03.349
Oh, shit.

26:03.351 --> 26:05.516
- No.
- Did I do that?

26:05.518 --> 26:08.986
No, no. What the literal hell?

26:08.988 --> 26:11.688
Please stop. Okay, I'm done.

26:11.691 --> 26:15.192
No, no. You're stressing
everyone out here, okay?

26:15.194 --> 26:17.529
Just go get some water
and take off your damn jacket.

26:17.531 --> 26:19.363
We've got to find a way
out of this Easy-Bake Oven.

26:19.365 --> 26:20.731
Okay, look at me, look at me.
Amanda.

26:20.733 --> 26:21.668
Oh, shit.

26:24.036 --> 26:27.004
Are those fans?
Are they blowing hot air?

26:27.006 --> 26:28.571
We'll just get some water,
okay?

26:28.573 --> 26:29.872
Come and get
some water with me.

26:29.874 --> 26:31.042
I'm fine. Okay.

26:31.044 --> 26:32.310
Yeah, it's getting hot,

26:32.312 --> 26:34.144
but nothing is going
to happen to us.

26:34.146 --> 26:36.747
- Ovens have fans.
- True, but so what?

26:36.749 --> 26:38.082
We've got to find
the posted rules.

26:38.084 --> 26:39.551
I don't care about the
posted rules.

26:39.553 --> 26:41.318
It might be colder
by the windows.

26:41.320 --> 26:42.723
I'm burning up.

26:45.191 --> 26:46.793
Come on,
how do we get out of here?

26:48.893 --> 26:51.329
You're not going to solve
anything by sitting on your ass.

26:51.331 --> 26:54.101
I'm not sitting on my ass.
I'm on my hands and knees.

26:56.803 --> 26:59.703
Hey, what are you three doing?
Look for something, come on.

26:59.705 --> 27:02.172
It's too hot.
What do you want me to do?

27:02.174 --> 27:03.675
Ladies, come on,
enough with the water.

27:03.677 --> 27:05.509
Get over here
and help us look.

27:05.511 --> 27:07.212
We just have to figure
out what the clue meant.

27:07.214 --> 27:09.046
Hold on. What's this?

27:09.048 --> 27:11.014
There's no way this
is part of the game.

27:11.017 --> 27:12.850
Where are all the clues at,
huh?

27:12.852 --> 27:14.251
Ah!

27:14.253 --> 27:15.918
Guys, come on.
It's getting hot in here.

27:15.920 --> 27:17.688
We've got to find something
to break this door open.

27:17.690 --> 27:19.924
Dude,
we're not supposed to use force.

27:19.926 --> 27:20.994
Come on!

27:22.428 --> 27:24.794
When is this over?
How do we get out?

27:24.796 --> 27:27.731
It's getting hotter.
We're being baked alive.

27:27.733 --> 27:29.265
Guys, relax.

27:29.267 --> 27:31.869
This is sick. Who does this?

27:31.871 --> 27:33.705
Come on, Ben.

27:33.707 --> 27:36.573
What do you want me to do?
I can't see anything.

27:36.575 --> 27:38.942
Guys,
we need to focus and find the clues.

27:38.944 --> 27:40.712
It's like 150 degrees in here.

27:41.747 --> 27:44.115
Hey. Hey, Zoey, the painting.

27:44.117 --> 27:45.817
Oh, my God. There's an exit.

27:45.819 --> 27:47.583
Oh, hot dog, look at that.

27:47.585 --> 27:50.623
Zoey, do that again. Whatever
you did, just do it again.

27:54.392 --> 27:57.426
Hey, guys, it's a duct.
It could be a way out.

27:57.429 --> 27:59.531
Guys,
there are more coasters here.

27:59.533 --> 28:01.031
Get on the coasters.

28:01.033 --> 28:02.765
Everyone try pressing down
at the same time.

28:02.767 --> 28:04.637
God, even the table's hot.

28:11.244 --> 28:13.277
- Is that it? Did we win the game?
- Yeah.

28:13.279 --> 28:15.111
- I'll go first.
- All right, we win the game.

28:15.113 --> 28:17.147
Whoa, whoa. Wait, you're
not going to just leave us

28:17.149 --> 28:18.715
with our dicks in our hands.

28:18.718 --> 28:21.820
Does anybody prefer
this guy go instead of me?

28:21.822 --> 28:24.224
- That's what I thought.
- Really?

28:32.833 --> 28:34.200
Where does it go?

28:36.102 --> 28:39.171
- How deep does it go?
- It goes pretty far.

28:42.274 --> 28:43.807
Jesus Christ.

28:43.809 --> 28:45.178
It's broiling.

28:47.848 --> 28:49.680
It's not getting
any cooler in here.

28:49.682 --> 28:51.782
Oh, my God. I'm so excited
for the next room.

28:51.784 --> 28:53.349
- The next room?
- Jason?

28:53.351 --> 28:57.454
Hey, I think I found a way out!
It's blocked by a grate.

28:57.456 --> 29:00.324
- Mike, bring that screwdriver.
- Yeah! It's in my pocket.

29:00.326 --> 29:02.259
Someone get it out of my pocket
for me. Come here, Amanda.

29:02.261 --> 29:03.827
Does anybody want
to take the screwdriver?

29:03.829 --> 29:05.462
- I've got it, I've got it. Go.
- Are you sure?

29:05.464 --> 29:07.130
Yeah. Go, go.

29:07.132 --> 29:09.500
- Just do it.
- You've got this, Mike.

29:09.502 --> 29:14.371
Go, man. It's not getting any colder.
Hurry up, go.

29:14.373 --> 29:16.808
- Mike, where you at?
- I'm coming.

29:23.482 --> 29:27.251
Hey, hey. Just think of it
like interactive dinner theater.

29:27.253 --> 29:28.887
Jesus Christ,
you're not helping me here, man.

29:28.889 --> 29:32.423
Okay, yeah.
I'm making it worse. My bad.

29:32.425 --> 29:35.128
Are you going
to come today or what?

29:38.031 --> 29:41.231
- Watch your face down there.
- You watch your face up there.

29:41.233 --> 29:42.735
Come on. Come on, come on.

29:46.372 --> 29:48.474
Hey, I got it.
You guys, come on!

29:50.377 --> 29:53.676
Do you want to go?
Amanda, you should go.

29:53.678 --> 29:55.647
Okay. Okay, here, take these.

29:55.649 --> 29:58.349
Okay. He can take that.
I'll hold it.

29:58.352 --> 30:01.017
- Okay.
- All right, come on.

30:01.019 --> 30:02.519
You've got this.

30:02.521 --> 30:03.890
All right.

30:09.896 --> 30:12.228
I feel like we're avoiding
the inevitable conclusion here.

30:12.230 --> 30:14.468
We're running out of hands.

30:17.036 --> 30:20.036
I've got an idea. Come here.
Put your foot on here, please.

30:20.038 --> 30:21.274
- Ow. Ow. Ow.
- Okay.

30:25.078 --> 30:27.878
This is the worst game
of Twister ever.

30:32.819 --> 30:35.121
Can we move a little
faster, please?

30:38.457 --> 30:40.389
- It didn't work.
- Shit.

30:40.392 --> 30:42.292
Okay,
maybe it needs to be full.

30:42.294 --> 30:44.997
- I think I'm going to pass out.
- Okay.

30:46.465 --> 30:49.934
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on!

30:49.936 --> 30:52.139
You can move your foot. Okay.

30:55.508 --> 30:56.907
- It worked!
- Yes, yes.

31:19.432 --> 31:21.098
Amanda?

31:21.100 --> 31:22.666
Hey, why don't you
just go help her?

31:22.668 --> 31:23.833
We'll fill the glasses.

31:23.835 --> 31:25.102
Stop being chivalrous,
dude.

31:25.104 --> 31:26.669
No one here
wants to have sex with you.

31:26.671 --> 31:27.805
- Go!
- Okay.

31:27.807 --> 31:30.273
Nice. Really nice, Ben.

31:30.275 --> 31:31.474
Shit.

31:31.476 --> 31:33.746
- Come on.
- Okay.

31:38.651 --> 31:40.821
She's clear.
Go, go, go. Come on.

31:42.521 --> 31:44.320
Come on,
you son of a bitch, please.

31:44.322 --> 31:45.657
Come on, come on, come on.

31:45.659 --> 31:48.692
Amanda? Amanda, I'm here.

31:48.694 --> 31:50.430
Okay. Good.

31:53.064 --> 31:55.698
What's wrong? You can breathe.
You're not stuck.

31:55.700 --> 31:58.468
Breathe in with me.
One, two...

32:00.339 --> 32:02.272
Two more.

32:02.274 --> 32:04.308
This is not real.
You're not stuck.

32:04.310 --> 32:07.678
You're okay. I'm here, okay?
I'm holding your hand.

32:07.680 --> 32:09.482
I promise I'm right here.
You're okay.

32:11.283 --> 32:13.716
Okay, we need one more.
We just need one more.

32:13.718 --> 32:15.618
Shit, we're out of water.

32:15.620 --> 32:16.986
What are we
supposed to do now?

32:16.988 --> 32:18.988
How would I know?
You're the expert here.

32:18.990 --> 32:21.157
We're really close.
We're really close, I promise.

32:21.159 --> 32:22.325
This is all your fault,
you know.

32:22.327 --> 32:23.793
- What?
- You're the reason

32:23.795 --> 32:25.229
that Amanda drank
all of our clues.

32:25.231 --> 32:27.196
Jason's right there, okay?

32:27.198 --> 32:30.900
How was I supposed to know
that the water cooler was...

32:30.902 --> 32:32.405
Oh, no.

32:36.108 --> 32:38.578
- Well, that's not good.
- What the fuck?

32:43.549 --> 32:44.917
My flask. My flask.

32:46.085 --> 32:47.887
You've had that
the whole time?

32:51.891 --> 32:53.092
Oh, my God.

32:54.860 --> 32:57.927
Come on! Yes. Yes.

32:57.929 --> 32:59.931
Do you want to burn to death?
Let's go!

33:19.118 --> 33:21.285
What the hell?

33:21.287 --> 33:24.923
Oh, Jesus.
Talk about immersive.

33:24.925 --> 33:28.257
Immersive? What the hell is
wrong with you? That was real!

33:28.259 --> 33:31.093
- They're just messing with us.
- Are you kidding me, dude?

33:31.096 --> 33:33.064
Look, it went off
right as I cleared it.

33:34.132 --> 33:36.167
Okay, I must have triggered it.

33:36.169 --> 33:38.135
The Games Master wants us
to think we barely made it.

33:38.137 --> 33:39.735
I can't be the only one.

33:39.738 --> 33:42.272
Hey. It's ten grand
and I don't lose.

33:42.274 --> 33:44.941
Well, I'm out, okay?

33:44.943 --> 33:46.443
Hi. Okay, I'm done.

33:46.445 --> 33:48.345
I want out.
You let me out of here now!

33:48.347 --> 33:50.581
You think they're
watching us right now?

33:50.583 --> 33:54.451
- Come on.
- "Sai-San lock and co."

33:54.453 --> 33:55.918
All right,
so we need another key.

33:55.920 --> 33:57.487
Give me your phone.
I'm calling the cops.

33:57.489 --> 33:58.756
Think about it for a
second, okay?

33:58.758 --> 34:00.357
What has actually happened
to us so far?

34:00.359 --> 34:02.192
Nothing. What will you
tell the cops?

34:02.194 --> 34:03.660
I don't know,
maybe that they locked us

34:03.663 --> 34:05.428
in a giant oven
and tried to cook us.

34:05.430 --> 34:07.897
Is open flame a common
occurrence in these things?

34:07.899 --> 34:09.065
- Not really.
- Not really.

34:09.067 --> 34:11.667
Give me your goddamn phone.

34:11.668 --> 34:13.735
You do have a phone.
How did you get a phone in here?

34:13.737 --> 34:14.841
I snuck it in.

34:16.610 --> 34:19.944
- There's no signal.
- Typical.

34:19.947 --> 34:23.179
Well, yeah. We're in
a giant concrete building.

34:23.181 --> 34:25.848
Guys, we can figure this out.
I mean, look at this place.

34:25.850 --> 34:28.817
I mean, the only thing missing
is the hot chocolate.

34:28.819 --> 34:31.020
All right, how long do you
think this game is going to last?

34:31.022 --> 34:33.822
I mean, I don't know. I did one
that had, like, five rooms once.

34:33.824 --> 34:35.759
Five?

34:35.761 --> 34:38.395
Five rooms? Okay.

34:38.397 --> 34:41.900
Okay. So, that means we just
need to do that four more times.

34:43.502 --> 34:45.235
I'm kidding. Come on, guys,
we can do this.

34:45.237 --> 34:46.869
That was the hardest room
by far, right?

34:46.871 --> 34:48.572
They front-loaded it,
right, Danny?

34:48.574 --> 34:50.541
Yeah. I mean,
I'm sure they can't afford

34:50.543 --> 34:51.908
to light every room
on fire.

34:51.909 --> 34:53.543
Exactly. Look at it.

34:53.545 --> 34:55.646
This place is
a goddamn tinder box.

34:55.648 --> 34:59.848
Hey. Hey, second lock, guys.

34:59.850 --> 35:01.887
It looks like we need
a seven-letter word.

35:03.422 --> 35:06.657
Let's spread out
and see what we can find.

35:06.659 --> 35:07.893
Okay.

35:18.703 --> 35:20.971
"You'll go down in history."

35:20.973 --> 35:23.072
What about this?
Could that mean something?

35:23.074 --> 35:24.742
"You'll go down in history."

35:24.744 --> 35:27.377
You'll go down in history.
You'll go down in history.

35:27.380 --> 35:29.481
Maybe a president's name?
Maybe a president's last name.

35:29.483 --> 35:31.547
What presidents have
a seven-letter last name?

35:31.549 --> 35:34.817
Madison, Jackson.
Lincoln, Johnson, Harding.

35:34.819 --> 35:37.488
- Whoa. Slow down there, Rain Man.
- That's offensive.

35:37.490 --> 35:40.357
What was the first one?
Madison.

35:40.359 --> 35:45.129
M-A-D-I-

35:45.131 --> 35:49.199
-S-O-N.

35:49.201 --> 35:52.768
No, that didn't work.
What was another one?

35:52.771 --> 35:54.606
- Johnson.
- Johnson. Okay, Johnson.

35:54.608 --> 35:57.808
J-O-H-N-S-O-N.

35:57.810 --> 35:59.476
No, what else?

35:59.478 --> 36:03.480
Yeah, Jackson. J-A-C-K-S-O-N.
What's the next name?

36:03.482 --> 36:05.617
- Try Lincoln. Lincoln.
- Lincoln?

36:05.619 --> 36:06.949
L-I-N-C-O-L-N.

36:06.951 --> 36:10.020
There are letters here,
but there are nine.

36:10.022 --> 36:11.657
No, that doesn't work either.

36:16.862 --> 36:19.798
♪ How the reindeer
Loved him ♪

36:19.800 --> 36:23.434
♪ As they shouted out
With glee ♪

36:23.436 --> 36:26.969
♪ Rudolph
The red-nosed reindeer ♪

36:26.971 --> 36:32.276
♪ You'll go down in history ♪

36:37.415 --> 36:40.683
Dasher, Dancer,
Prancer, Vixen...

36:40.685 --> 36:43.456
Comet, Cupid, Donner,
Blitzen.

36:45.458 --> 36:48.592
- You'll go down in history.
- What is he talking about?

36:48.594 --> 36:50.761
- It's "Rudolph."
- Did he say "Rudolph"?

36:50.763 --> 36:53.899
- Yeah, try "Rudolph."
- All right, "Rudolph" it is.

36:57.836 --> 36:59.037
Bingo!

36:59.039 --> 37:01.305
Look at that.
Hey, he helps.

37:01.307 --> 37:03.207
All right.

37:03.209 --> 37:05.677
Hey, see?
It's going to be fine from now on.

37:05.679 --> 37:07.513
No more scary shit.

37:21.259 --> 37:22.728
Hey...

37:23.795 --> 37:25.331
are you okay?

37:26.865 --> 37:28.466
Yeah, fine.

37:31.970 --> 37:34.036
Look at this,
going from hot to cold.

37:34.039 --> 37:35.839
You know,
that's how you get sick.

37:44.717 --> 37:46.016
Whoa.

37:51.022 --> 37:54.093
Dumb question.
Are we outside...

37:56.162 --> 37:59.029
or am I
stone-cold tripping?

37:59.031 --> 38:02.234
I don't know, man.
This place is really cold.

38:05.905 --> 38:09.572
It's 30 degrees and dropping.

38:09.574 --> 38:12.008
Real fun game, huh?

38:12.010 --> 38:13.610
- Echo!
- Hey.

38:13.612 --> 38:15.311
This whole place is bullshit.

38:15.313 --> 38:16.712
The sooner we figure this out,

38:16.715 --> 38:17.914
the sooner we get
the hell of out here.

38:17.916 --> 38:19.550
This is beautiful. Oh, man,

38:19.552 --> 38:21.919
I could hang out in here
for a while.

38:21.921 --> 38:23.789
It's like ice skating.

38:25.857 --> 38:28.525
- Into the great wide open, Danny!
- Be careful.

38:29.762 --> 38:31.862
Keep going, man.
Check it out.

38:31.864 --> 38:35.102
- Yeah, where are you going?
- Let him figure it out.

38:40.071 --> 38:43.373
Whoa!

38:43.376 --> 38:46.044
- Guys?
- Hey, nobody move.

38:46.046 --> 38:49.378
Come on, guys. Relax, okay?
It's fine. Look.

38:49.381 --> 38:50.414
Hey, don't do that.

38:50.416 --> 38:51.815
It's just a sound effect.

38:51.817 --> 38:53.083
The ice isn't cracking.

38:53.085 --> 38:54.618
They are watching to make sure

38:54.620 --> 38:55.954
nothing bad happens to us.

38:55.956 --> 38:57.719
I mean, can you imagine
the lawsuits

38:57.721 --> 38:59.755
if one of us
actually got hurt?

38:59.758 --> 39:03.130
Learn to have some fun
in your life. Jeez.

39:05.497 --> 39:07.366
Whoever did this is an artist.

39:09.135 --> 39:10.101
What is that?

39:11.771 --> 39:14.837
- Danny, come on back.
- Get over here. Hurry up, Danny.

39:14.839 --> 39:16.073
Shit.

39:16.075 --> 39:17.073
There's freezing air

39:17.075 --> 39:18.075
coming through those vents.

39:18.077 --> 39:19.208
Come on, Danny!

39:19.210 --> 39:20.643
Danny, get back here.

39:20.645 --> 39:22.645
Okay. I'm coming. I'm coming.

39:22.647 --> 39:25.249
- Shit, that is cold.
- Get together for body heat.

39:25.251 --> 39:27.917
- Oh, the air is freezing.
- Stay close.

39:27.919 --> 39:30.620
- This is awesome.
- Why are they doing this?

39:30.622 --> 39:33.458
- Come on, get closer.
- Oh, my God, that's cold.

39:37.328 --> 39:39.765
We should look for clues.

39:47.539 --> 39:49.006
Hello?

39:49.008 --> 39:50.042
Hey.

39:52.477 --> 39:54.380
Open, open, open.

40:03.188 --> 40:05.355
Hey.

40:05.358 --> 40:07.525
- Yeah, do you want to look?
- Yeah.

40:11.363 --> 40:13.232
"True north is a lie."

40:24.376 --> 40:26.313
What are you looking at?

40:32.150 --> 40:33.252
Good boy.

40:36.222 --> 40:38.357
Hey, I found a door.
We need a small key.

40:42.394 --> 40:44.495
Where did that come from?

40:44.497 --> 40:47.364
One coat for six people?

40:47.366 --> 40:49.532
You know what they're
trying to do, right?

40:49.534 --> 40:53.371
They want us to fight over
limited resources. Jesus Christ.

40:54.572 --> 40:57.508
Hey. Hey, assholes.

40:57.510 --> 40:59.842
It's not going to work
this time, okay?

40:59.844 --> 41:01.245
We're going to share it.

41:01.247 --> 41:04.050
Zoey, you go first.

41:04.915 --> 41:06.418
Thank you.

41:18.731 --> 41:20.599
- Shit, that's cold.
- Ben.

41:27.273 --> 41:30.106
Shit! Oh, that's cold.

41:30.108 --> 41:33.109
Hey, false alarm, everybody.

41:33.111 --> 41:35.278
A giant fishing hole.
How did you miss that?

41:35.280 --> 41:37.180
What are we supposed to do
with this?

41:37.182 --> 41:38.681
There could be a clue
at the bottom.

41:38.683 --> 41:41.516
Oh, really? Why don't you
go dive in and check?

41:41.518 --> 41:43.719
Okay, it just feels like
I'm playing

41:43.722 --> 41:46.557
the world's funnest game
with the world's meanest people.

41:46.559 --> 41:49.058
I can't feel my goddamn leg.

41:49.060 --> 41:51.762
- Hey, guys.
- Mike?

41:51.764 --> 41:53.463
Ha!

41:53.465 --> 41:55.998
Look, I've got it.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.335
I mean, I've got something.

41:58.337 --> 41:59.969
I just climbed a tree for,
like,

41:59.971 --> 42:01.838
the first time
in my goddamn life.

42:01.840 --> 42:03.339
Danny, tell me this is something
we can use.

42:03.341 --> 42:05.741
Yeah, totally. It's a clue.

42:05.744 --> 42:08.978
Finally,
something I'm good at.

42:08.980 --> 42:12.416
You mean you can stand
over a hole and hold a stick?

42:12.418 --> 42:14.584
Wow, thank God you're here.

42:14.586 --> 42:16.486
I understand
you're cold right now,

42:16.488 --> 42:18.286
but if you say something
disrespectful to me

42:18.288 --> 42:20.255
like that again...
I'm going to give you

42:20.257 --> 42:22.192
the slap your parents
should have years ago.

42:22.194 --> 42:23.793
- Oh, really?
- That's amazing.

42:23.795 --> 42:25.395
With pleasure.

42:25.398 --> 42:27.163
So, what are we
supposed to do now,

42:27.165 --> 42:29.565
just stand here and wait
to catch a clue?

42:29.567 --> 42:31.434
Well,
it's probably really deep.

42:31.436 --> 42:34.070
Yeah,
I'm about 20 feet down already.

42:34.072 --> 42:35.607
I can't even see.

42:37.841 --> 42:39.442
This is a waste of time.

42:39.444 --> 42:40.744
You think this
is a waste of time?

42:40.746 --> 42:42.277
- Yeah.
- It's so goddamn cold.

42:42.279 --> 42:43.945
I do.
I think it's a distraction.

42:43.947 --> 42:45.815
I think this whole
thing is a waste of time.

42:45.817 --> 42:47.650
I climbed up to
the top of that tree.

42:47.652 --> 42:49.187
I found a fishing rod
up there.

42:51.157 --> 42:52.858
True north.

42:54.994 --> 42:56.195
What?

42:59.698 --> 43:03.065
What are you trying
to tell me?

43:03.068 --> 43:05.104
True north is a lie.

43:09.875 --> 43:12.241
They're probably watching us,
laughing their asses off,

43:12.243 --> 43:14.710
as we stand around a hole
like a bunch of morons.

43:14.713 --> 43:16.978
- We probably just have to wait.
- Oh, screw that, man.

43:16.980 --> 43:19.315
Give me this, Mike.
Mike, give me the pole!

43:19.317 --> 43:20.651
Why don't you chill out, man?

43:20.653 --> 43:21.919
You don't know
what you're doing, man.

43:21.921 --> 43:23.418
You don't even have
the release open.

43:23.420 --> 43:24.587
Don't let it out.

43:24.589 --> 43:26.424
You've got to drop it
to the bottom.

43:34.632 --> 43:35.534
Shit, that's deep.

43:37.803 --> 43:40.069
Screw this. Here, take this.

43:40.071 --> 43:41.172
Give me that back.

43:42.407 --> 43:44.307
I'm sorry, all right?

43:44.309 --> 43:47.177
I hate the cold
and it makes me go crazy.

43:47.179 --> 43:49.046
I have to spend every winter
in Kauai.

43:49.048 --> 43:51.550
Me, too. When I'm not
in the South of France.

43:54.652 --> 43:57.186
Hey, where's Zoey
with that jacket?

43:57.188 --> 43:58.556
I need that jacket.

44:11.536 --> 44:12.505
Yes.

44:16.641 --> 44:18.977
Hey, you mind not
smoking that around me?

44:27.217 --> 44:29.787
Pull up the line.
I found something.

44:29.789 --> 44:31.521
- Pull up the line.
- What?

44:31.523 --> 44:33.724
Everyone, I found something.

44:33.726 --> 44:35.258
What do you got there?

44:35.260 --> 44:37.460
Another clue?
Impressive, Zoey.

44:37.462 --> 44:39.862
- What is it?
- Okay.

44:39.864 --> 44:42.435
- A magnet, of course.
- I'm with you. Okay, okay.

44:44.935 --> 44:46.768
Okay, try it. Try it now.

44:46.770 --> 44:49.304
All right, all right.
Stand back.

44:49.306 --> 44:51.474
There she goes.

44:51.476 --> 44:54.846
Zoey, your turn is up.

44:55.779 --> 44:57.482
Right. Sorry.

44:58.918 --> 45:01.516
Oh, shit.
Okay. I'm on the bottom.

45:01.518 --> 45:02.753
No, I'm hooked.

45:02.755 --> 45:04.253
All right,
I've got something.

45:04.255 --> 45:05.456
I've got something here.

45:05.458 --> 45:06.823
Yeah,
I'm definitely hooked.

45:06.825 --> 45:08.193
Oh, God.

45:09.762 --> 45:12.427
- Nice.
- God, that's heavy.

45:12.429 --> 45:13.962
Okay. Okay, I've got it.
I've got it.

45:13.964 --> 45:15.699
You've got it?

45:15.701 --> 45:17.666
We've got a key or something.

45:17.668 --> 45:19.601
You've got it. Okay.

45:19.603 --> 45:21.707
That's got to
be the key to the door.

45:23.708 --> 45:27.442
- Who thinks of this shit?
- One, two, three.

45:27.444 --> 45:31.081
Okay. One, two, three.

45:31.083 --> 45:32.685
- Okay.
- Shit, that is solid.

45:37.322 --> 45:40.792
- Hey, Ben. We need your lighter.
- Oh, yeah, that's a good idea.

45:41.926 --> 45:44.460
What do I get in return?

45:44.462 --> 45:47.462
I won't take
any of your One Direction CDs.

45:49.767 --> 45:51.702
Come on, just give it, man.

45:51.704 --> 45:54.137
All right,
you want the lighter?

45:54.139 --> 45:55.773
Here.

45:55.775 --> 45:57.206
There you go.

46:00.979 --> 46:04.580
- Okay, I'll get it.
- Thanks, Danny.

46:04.582 --> 46:06.215
I don't know.

46:06.217 --> 46:08.583
Man, that is buried
right in the center, isn't it?

46:08.585 --> 46:11.356
Oh, and you're welcome,
by the way.

46:14.159 --> 46:15.226
Thanks a lot.

46:23.768 --> 46:24.704
Danny?

46:27.404 --> 46:30.442
What was that? What happened?
Where's Danny?

46:31.576 --> 46:32.809
Say something. Where is he?

46:32.811 --> 46:34.310
He just fell through.

46:34.312 --> 46:35.912
What do you
mean, he fell through?

46:35.914 --> 46:37.078
He's under the ice!

46:37.081 --> 46:39.816
Danny! Danny! Danny!

46:39.818 --> 46:41.685
All right,
I'm going in after him.

46:41.687 --> 46:43.653
No, no. There is
a current under there.

46:43.655 --> 46:44.921
Even if you find him,

46:44.923 --> 46:46.726
you will not make it
back to the hole.

46:49.760 --> 46:50.895
Danny, where are you?

46:52.664 --> 46:54.699
He's being dragged
around under there.

46:58.236 --> 46:59.534
Danny!

46:59.536 --> 47:01.170
Danny, where are you?

47:01.172 --> 47:03.275
- Danny! Where did he go?
- Do you see him?

47:05.076 --> 47:06.412
- I can't see him.
- Danny!

47:08.046 --> 47:10.515
Shush, shush, shush! Shush!

47:15.753 --> 47:18.690
- Oh, my God. Danny.
- Where is he?

47:25.730 --> 47:28.297
Danny. Danny, Danny.

47:30.403 --> 47:32.004
What happened?

47:43.313 --> 47:44.850
You were right.

47:46.817 --> 47:48.420
This is real.

47:55.260 --> 47:57.029
How did it happen?

47:58.129 --> 47:59.498
Hey!

48:01.066 --> 48:03.299
- How did it happen?
- What?

48:03.301 --> 48:06.302
How did Danny fall in?
You're the only one who saw.

48:06.304 --> 48:10.672
He was there and then it
exploded and then he fell.

48:10.674 --> 48:14.178
You threw him the lighter and
somehow you're perfectly fine?

48:14.180 --> 48:16.479
I threw it across the ice.
I was just being an asshole.

48:16.481 --> 48:17.947
Yeah, you threw it
to the exact spot

48:17.949 --> 48:19.148
that just happened
to collapse?

48:19.150 --> 48:20.616
Are you saying that I did it?

48:20.618 --> 48:22.319
Yeah, hey, your words,
not mine.

48:23.955 --> 48:26.156
Danny kept talking
about a Games Master.

48:26.158 --> 48:29.024
Yeah. Well,
maybe he's already here.

48:29.026 --> 48:32.662
Games Master? I work at
a grocery store, all right?

48:32.664 --> 48:34.163
I mean, Jason's the one here

48:34.165 --> 48:35.898
with the whole
<i>American Psycho</i> vibe.

48:35.900 --> 48:38.669
Mike, you're like the creep
at the truck stop.

48:38.671 --> 48:40.335
And Zoey, I'm really sorry,

48:40.337 --> 48:42.639
but it seems like your parents
locked you in a basement

48:42.641 --> 48:44.339
until you finished
all your homework.

48:44.341 --> 48:45.775
And her. What about her?

48:45.777 --> 48:47.442
I mean, where did
she get all the scars?

48:47.444 --> 48:48.978
I served in Iraq,
asshole.

48:48.980 --> 48:50.880
Oh, so you've had
military experience?

48:50.882 --> 48:52.218
So, that makes you like a...

48:54.384 --> 48:56.854
psycho Xena.

48:56.856 --> 49:00.355
I'm just saying here, I'm,
like, the least suspicious one.

49:00.357 --> 49:02.059
Okay, you know what?
Shut up!

49:02.061 --> 49:04.826
None of it matters,
all right?

49:04.828 --> 49:06.695
Whoever did this to us
will let us freeze to death,

49:06.697 --> 49:08.566
if we don't get the key
out of that ice.

49:10.235 --> 49:13.002
Okay. Since Ben's
lighter is gone,

49:13.004 --> 49:15.872
we have to surround it with
as much body heat as possible.

49:15.874 --> 49:17.208
Ben's lighter
is gone?

49:18.942 --> 49:21.412
Danny is dead.

49:21.414 --> 49:24.679
Do you know what happens
when you get hypothermia?

49:24.681 --> 49:26.915
Huh?

49:26.917 --> 49:29.951
You get disoriented
and confused.

49:29.953 --> 49:31.622
And I don't care
how smart you are

49:31.624 --> 49:32.890
or how many books
you read,

49:32.892 --> 49:34.624
you won't remember
how you got here,

49:34.626 --> 49:35.958
much less how to get out.

49:35.960 --> 49:37.460
You guys get over here

49:37.462 --> 49:39.464
and put your hands
on this ice.

49:49.740 --> 49:52.074
I know it's cold,
but it's melting, guys.

49:52.077 --> 49:53.842
Come on,
just keep your hands on it.

49:53.844 --> 49:55.614
Hey, jacket.

50:03.923 --> 50:06.723
Let me take it for a minute.
Oh, that's cold.

50:06.726 --> 50:10.829
Okay. Here. Jesus.

50:24.142 --> 50:26.843
How are you doing
there, Mike?

50:26.845 --> 50:28.643
- Oh, you know.
- Need a break?

50:28.645 --> 50:30.913
Mm-mm. No, I got it.

50:30.915 --> 50:33.682
I'm okay. I'm okay.
Thank you.

50:33.684 --> 50:35.854
I just can't
figure it out.

50:37.856 --> 50:38.958
Who would do this?

50:40.791 --> 50:43.361
Someone who thought
of every detail.

51:05.583 --> 51:07.282
- Mike?
- Hey, Mike.

51:07.284 --> 51:09.118
Hey, put your back
against the tree.

51:09.120 --> 51:11.253
- No, I'm okay.
- We're here, okay?

51:15.025 --> 51:16.626
Hey, we're here,
we're here.

51:16.628 --> 51:18.027
- Jason?
- Where's he going?

51:18.029 --> 51:19.828
He's got the key.
You guys, come on.

51:19.830 --> 51:21.765
- Get up, come on.
- Okay.

51:23.134 --> 51:26.703
- Where is it at?
- Hey, Jason.

51:26.706 --> 51:28.570
Where's it at?
Where's the door?

51:28.572 --> 51:32.175
- Jason!
- Get off me!

51:32.177 --> 51:34.644
Where's the door?

51:34.646 --> 51:36.511
There's a door?

51:36.513 --> 51:37.747
Open it.

51:37.749 --> 51:40.849
Open the goddamn door!
Open up!

51:40.851 --> 51:43.985
Open this door!
Open the goddamn door!

51:45.623 --> 51:48.894
Hey, you did it,
you opened a door.

51:50.495 --> 51:52.494
- Move.
- Jason! Let's go!

51:52.496 --> 51:54.797
Wait.

51:56.701 --> 51:57.937
Oh, shit!

52:01.305 --> 52:02.804
- Wait, wait.
- Zoey, come on!

52:02.806 --> 52:03.742
Wait for me!

52:05.843 --> 52:06.909
Ben!

52:13.584 --> 52:15.655
Hey, is everyone okay?

52:17.756 --> 52:20.121
I can't feel my extremities.

52:20.124 --> 52:21.425
What is that?

52:28.233 --> 52:29.769
Uh-huh.

52:31.268 --> 52:34.072
Sure, why not?

52:40.377 --> 52:42.277
Well...

52:42.279 --> 52:46.047
glass half full,
at least it's warm in here.

52:47.418 --> 52:48.951
Oh, my God.

52:48.953 --> 52:50.453
What's happening?
What is that?

52:50.455 --> 52:52.454
- Are we moving?
- Yeah. Hold on.

52:53.626 --> 52:56.725
- What, are we going up?
- Yeah.

52:56.727 --> 52:58.628
How many floors
is this building?

52:58.630 --> 53:00.295
15 to 20 floors.

53:00.297 --> 53:03.234
Well, I'm guessing they didn't
shoot us up here for the view.

53:26.191 --> 53:27.758
Okay.

53:27.760 --> 53:29.362
How are we supposed to
answer that?

53:37.435 --> 53:38.433
Hello?

53:41.004 --> 53:43.941
Son of a bitch!

53:43.943 --> 53:46.644
God, that's loud.
And it sucks.

53:48.313 --> 53:50.680
Oh, great, we're going to
die to elevator music.

53:50.682 --> 53:54.016
Guys, hey, this door up here
doesn't have a handle.

53:54.018 --> 53:56.451
I think we're
looking for a doorknob.

53:56.453 --> 53:58.353
Let's see
what we can find.

53:58.355 --> 54:01.656
<i>♪ Listen to the music
Of the traffic in the city ♪</i>

54:01.658 --> 54:05.661
<i>♪ Linger on the sidewalk
The neon signs are pretty ♪</i>

54:05.663 --> 54:09.632
<i>♪ How can you lose
The lights are much... ♪</i>

54:09.634 --> 54:13.336
Hey, the eight ball, it's
missing from the pool table.

54:13.338 --> 54:15.770
Look at that. I'm going to
check these cue racks.

54:15.773 --> 54:18.674
Maybe there's something
over here we can use.

54:20.911 --> 54:22.744
- Hey. Mike, stop!
- Mike! Mike!

54:24.549 --> 54:26.249
Get away from the edge.
Grab onto something.

54:26.251 --> 54:28.217
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Mike, step back! Mike!

54:28.219 --> 54:30.485
- Guys, come on.
- Hey, get off the floor!

54:30.487 --> 54:34.256
Mike, hurry up!
Mike, get off the floor.

54:34.258 --> 54:36.826
- Shit.
- Did you see that?

54:36.828 --> 54:39.228
What the hell's going on?

54:43.766 --> 54:46.571
What is this,
like, musical chairs?

54:49.239 --> 54:50.539
What do we do now?

54:50.541 --> 54:52.841
I don't know, try not to die.

54:52.843 --> 54:55.010
Hey, Amanda,
just think about this.

54:55.012 --> 54:56.212
Just let me try this.

54:56.214 --> 54:57.679
Go, go, go.

55:00.884 --> 55:03.317
- Oh, shit.
- Are you okay?

55:03.319 --> 55:06.723
Yeah, it's just wet.
Oh, shit.

55:08.026 --> 55:09.794
Okay, here I go.

55:11.596 --> 55:15.564
Hey, what about the radio?
Maybe it'll shut the music off.

55:15.566 --> 55:17.102
No, I don't think
it's connected.

55:19.371 --> 55:21.270
What about those coolers
at the top?

55:21.272 --> 55:22.571
Okay.

55:22.573 --> 55:24.407
Maybe the handle's in there.

55:24.409 --> 55:26.477
And keep your eyes
peeled for that eight ball.

55:26.479 --> 55:27.413
Okay.

55:29.379 --> 55:32.714
Yeah, the craftsmanship
in here is just terrifying.

55:32.716 --> 55:34.750
I hate this room so much.

55:34.753 --> 55:35.987
Guys, I've got a lock box.

55:38.623 --> 55:39.758
All right.

55:41.126 --> 55:43.292
It looks like
I need four numbers.

55:43.294 --> 55:46.094
All right, try
one-two-three-four. Just to see.

55:46.096 --> 55:48.430
I guess we know
Mike's PIN code.

55:51.935 --> 55:53.569
Nope.

55:53.571 --> 55:55.704
All right.
Try one-one-one-one.

55:55.706 --> 55:57.272
You know, go back
to the basics.

55:57.274 --> 55:59.244
What? One-one-one-one?

56:00.412 --> 56:02.445
Uh, nope. That's not it.

56:02.447 --> 56:04.582
It's a giant sliding puzzle.

56:07.619 --> 56:08.817
- Zo?
- Zoey?

56:08.819 --> 56:10.587
- Zoey, what are you doing?
- Zo?

56:11.990 --> 56:14.592
Careful.
Careful, careful, careful.

56:28.173 --> 56:29.871
Good job, Zo.

56:29.873 --> 56:31.840
That's good, Zoey.
Just stay there.

56:31.842 --> 56:33.308
Where are you going?

56:33.310 --> 56:35.580
I can't hang around
on this bookshelf all day.

56:39.818 --> 56:42.921
This was a bad idea.
Oh, God.

56:45.322 --> 56:47.355
Come on.
One, two, three.

56:49.225 --> 56:51.394
Up you get.

56:51.396 --> 56:52.561
Thanks.

56:52.563 --> 56:53.864
Okay.

57:09.313 --> 57:10.612
Oh, shit!

57:10.614 --> 57:13.547
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, shit.

57:13.549 --> 57:15.318
Jason, hold on!

57:16.886 --> 57:20.789
I'm okay. I'm okay.
Oh, God. I'm okay. Oh, God.

57:20.791 --> 57:22.157
Are you all right?

57:22.159 --> 57:25.560
Keep going. Keep going.
I'm okay.

57:25.562 --> 57:27.563
He's okay.
It's okay, he's okay.

57:27.565 --> 57:29.435
You've got this.
You've got this.

57:34.039 --> 57:37.275
Is there anything we can do
about this shitty music?

57:43.748 --> 57:45.082
Oh, God!

57:45.084 --> 57:46.349
Oh, my God.

57:46.351 --> 57:48.053
Jesus Christ.

57:55.626 --> 57:57.224
Hey, I've got it.

57:57.226 --> 57:58.463
What?

57:59.530 --> 58:01.731
Got it.

58:01.733 --> 58:05.433
There are colors.
I see yellow...

58:05.436 --> 58:07.736
black, and blue.

58:07.738 --> 58:11.274
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and we've
got two lines and a circle.

58:11.276 --> 58:14.509
It's like Morse code.
Maybe it's Morse code.

58:14.511 --> 58:17.413
Stripes and circles.
They're billiard balls.

58:17.415 --> 58:19.614
The yellow stripe,
that's a nine.

58:19.616 --> 58:21.184
Nine. Next.

58:21.186 --> 58:23.886
The black ball, like, that's
the eight ball, obviously.

58:23.888 --> 58:25.888
- Eight. Two more.
- Blue stripe, that's ten.

58:25.890 --> 58:27.355
Try one-zero.

58:27.357 --> 58:31.294
One-zero. Goddamn it.

58:31.296 --> 58:33.396
- Shit.
- Shit!

58:33.398 --> 58:35.533
- Go, go, go.
- Get off the floor.

58:40.773 --> 58:43.438
You've got it, Mike.
Come on.

58:43.440 --> 58:44.673
Oh, my God.

58:49.113 --> 58:50.412
Hold on, okay?

58:52.082 --> 58:54.181
That thing's not going to hold
all three of you.

58:54.183 --> 58:56.183
- Mike, climb off.
- And go where?

58:56.185 --> 58:58.286
- Use that rack on your right.
- Here, here.

58:58.288 --> 59:00.288
Guys, just hang on, okay?

59:00.290 --> 59:02.157
Oh, shit, I can't. I can't.

59:02.159 --> 59:04.494
Mike, look at me.
Get off the goddamn shelf

59:04.496 --> 59:06.094
before you get
everybody killed.

59:06.096 --> 59:07.597
Mike, man up.

59:07.599 --> 59:10.264
Stop yelling at him,
okay? Stop.

59:10.266 --> 59:13.302
Mike, I'll move. I can move,
okay? Just stay there.

59:13.304 --> 59:15.170
Just stay there.
Don't worry about it.

59:15.172 --> 59:16.304
Just go, go.

59:16.306 --> 59:18.840
Zoey. Hey,
give me your hand.

59:18.842 --> 59:20.443
Come on,
give me your hand.

59:20.445 --> 59:23.345
- Zoey, hey. Come on.
- Careful.

59:23.347 --> 59:25.846
Come on, give me your hand.
Zoey. Zoey!

59:25.848 --> 59:27.452
Zoey. Hey, Zoey.

59:30.821 --> 59:32.052
Oh, God!

59:32.054 --> 59:33.622
- Goddamn it!
- Zoey!

59:33.624 --> 59:35.992
You've got to get up.
Come on.

59:35.994 --> 59:38.293
Zoey, wake up.
Zoey, get off the floor.

59:38.295 --> 59:42.697
Zoey, stay with me. Hey, you
guys come on, I'll go get her.

59:42.699 --> 59:45.701
<i>Come in, Vietnam Air 109.</i>

59:45.704 --> 59:48.302
<i>Come in, Vietnam Air 109.</i>

59:48.304 --> 59:50.907
Mom. Mom. Mom.

59:50.909 --> 59:53.708
Mom. Mom. Mom.

59:53.710 --> 59:55.578
Mama. Mom!

59:55.580 --> 59:57.878
Zoey, come on, wake up.

59:57.880 --> 01:00:00.182
Zoey, wake up.
Zoey, come on.

01:00:00.184 --> 01:00:01.715
We've got to go.
Zoey, come on!

01:00:01.717 --> 01:00:03.553
We're upside down.

01:00:03.555 --> 01:00:05.287
Hey. Come on, come on.

01:00:06.657 --> 01:00:08.191
Hey, go, go.

01:00:08.193 --> 01:00:10.724
The room is upside down,
so the code might be, too.

01:00:10.726 --> 01:00:12.163
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:00:14.831 --> 01:00:17.965
Try zero-one-eight-six.

01:00:17.967 --> 01:00:21.037
Zero-one-eight-six.

01:00:23.041 --> 01:00:25.207
- I've got it.
- Okay, we've got it. Come on.

01:00:25.209 --> 01:00:27.043
- Zoey, you're a genius.
- Come on, hurry up.

01:00:27.045 --> 01:00:28.678
Come on, Ben,
hurry up. Hurry up.

01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:30.244
- Come on. Hurry up.
- Okay.

01:00:30.246 --> 01:00:31.712
Come on,
the floor's going to drop.

01:00:33.851 --> 01:00:35.819
That is the second time
this floor has tried to kill me.

01:00:37.554 --> 01:00:38.590
Shit.

01:00:40.558 --> 01:00:42.691
Come on, Jason.

01:00:42.693 --> 01:00:43.895
I've got it.

01:00:46.029 --> 01:00:47.331
Okay.

01:00:54.036 --> 01:00:55.305
Okay.

01:01:01.212 --> 01:01:03.081
- Okay.
- Amanda, be careful.

01:01:06.583 --> 01:01:07.883
Hang on. Hang on.

01:01:07.885 --> 01:01:09.619
All right, you've got this.

01:01:09.621 --> 01:01:11.489
Yes. Yes.

01:01:12.955 --> 01:01:15.223
- All right.
- No, don't look down.

01:01:15.225 --> 01:01:16.461
Okay.

01:01:21.130 --> 01:01:22.431
Okay.

01:01:26.637 --> 01:01:27.971
You've got it.
You've got it.

01:01:30.207 --> 01:01:31.576
Okay.

01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:39.016
Come on. Come on.

01:01:41.019 --> 01:01:43.618
- Okay.
- Shit. Oh, no.

01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:44.820
Okay.

01:01:46.156 --> 01:01:47.989
- The ball!
- No!

01:01:47.991 --> 01:01:49.523
Just let it go!

01:01:49.525 --> 01:01:51.760
- Just leave it.
- Hey, stop, stop!

01:01:56.333 --> 01:01:58.500
- Just leave it.
- Amanda!

01:01:58.502 --> 01:01:59.769
No!

01:01:59.771 --> 01:02:01.771
Oh, shit!

01:02:01.773 --> 01:02:03.041
Jason!

01:02:04.376 --> 01:02:05.873
- I got it. The cord!
- Jump!

01:02:07.444 --> 01:02:08.744
Hey, give me
the pool cue.

01:02:08.747 --> 01:02:10.744
Yeah, good idea. Hang on.

01:02:10.746 --> 01:02:12.782
Hang on, Amanda. Hang on.
Come on, reach out there.

01:02:12.784 --> 01:02:14.984
- Grab on to this, come on!
- Grab it.

01:02:14.986 --> 01:02:18.085
I can't get it any farther.

01:02:18.087 --> 01:02:19.421
Hey, you can do it.

01:02:19.423 --> 01:02:21.523
You can do it.
You can do it, Amanda.

01:02:21.525 --> 01:02:23.525
You can do this.
Just grab it, okay?

01:02:23.527 --> 01:02:25.327
Grab on to it!

01:02:25.329 --> 01:02:27.796
Come on, you got this.
It's just right there.

01:02:27.798 --> 01:02:29.965
Amanda, listen to me.
You can do it.

01:02:29.967 --> 01:02:33.134
You can do this. We're
right here. Okay? Stay. No.

01:02:33.137 --> 01:02:34.702
It's okay.

01:02:34.704 --> 01:02:38.306
Amanda! No, stay, okay?
Just hold on, just hold on. No!

01:02:38.308 --> 01:02:40.743
No!

01:02:40.745 --> 01:02:44.145
No, no, no! No, no!

01:02:44.148 --> 01:02:45.850
No, Amanda, no, no!

01:03:16.312 --> 01:03:18.847
Zoey, come on.
Hey, come on. Get out!

01:03:18.849 --> 01:03:19.950
No.

01:03:46.076 --> 01:03:48.311
What in the hell
is this supposed to be?

01:03:54.753 --> 01:03:58.488
I don't see a way out.
Do you see anything?

01:03:58.490 --> 01:04:01.791
Hey, wunderkind, I need
your brain. Get in here.

01:04:01.793 --> 01:04:03.458
Zoey!

01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:06.661
Will you give her a minute?
Amanda just died!

01:04:06.663 --> 01:04:08.597
What don't you
people understand?

01:04:08.599 --> 01:04:10.165
We don't have minutes to waste.

01:04:10.167 --> 01:04:12.900
Amanda is dead.
We aren't.

01:04:12.902 --> 01:04:14.469
Survival of the fittest.

01:04:14.471 --> 01:04:16.304
Will you stop being a dick?

01:04:16.306 --> 01:04:17.974
What is your problem?

01:04:17.976 --> 01:04:21.977
Amanda wasn't weak, okay?
She sacrificed herself for us!

01:04:21.979 --> 01:04:24.311
Okay, well, then let's
not waste that sacrifice

01:04:24.313 --> 01:04:25.915
by getting yourself killed.

01:04:54.546 --> 01:04:56.648
This was my room.

01:05:33.283 --> 01:05:35.116
Exactly the same.

01:05:35.119 --> 01:05:37.120
This is my bed.

01:05:37.122 --> 01:05:38.656
Me, too.

01:05:54.371 --> 01:05:56.041
It's Amanda's.

01:06:00.177 --> 01:06:01.377
IED blast.

01:06:02.913 --> 01:06:04.548
She was the only survivor.

01:06:06.583 --> 01:06:09.350
I was on a plane
with my mom...

01:06:09.352 --> 01:06:12.354
backpacking across
Vietnam.

01:06:12.356 --> 01:06:17.093
The plane just crashed
in the middle of the jungle.

01:06:17.095 --> 01:06:19.528
It took them a week
to find me.

01:06:19.530 --> 01:06:21.266
I remember that.

01:06:22.999 --> 01:06:24.935
You were on the news.

01:06:26.569 --> 01:06:29.104
My college roommate
and I took a boat out...

01:06:29.106 --> 01:06:31.108
and a wave came out of nowhere
and just...

01:06:32.241 --> 01:06:33.911
flipped the boat over.

01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:38.550
And I tried to grab
a line and, uh...

01:06:40.117 --> 01:06:42.086
almost took my thumb off.

01:06:43.755 --> 01:06:45.520
Wet...

01:06:45.522 --> 01:06:49.723
freezing,
just holding on to the hull...

01:06:49.725 --> 01:06:53.294
with only one jacket
between the two of us.

01:06:53.296 --> 01:06:58.900
<i>And Nathan, he started getting
aggressive and confused.</i>

01:06:58.902 --> 01:07:00.802
It was signs of hypothermia,

01:07:00.804 --> 01:07:02.504
they told me later
in the hospital.

01:07:02.506 --> 01:07:03.906
<i>Nathan, come back!</i>

01:07:03.908 --> 01:07:05.639
<i>On the second day,
he swam off.</i>

01:07:05.641 --> 01:07:08.275
<i>I don't know what he thought
he saw out there...</i>

01:07:08.277 --> 01:07:10.645
<i>but there was
nothing but ocean.</i>

01:07:10.647 --> 01:07:15.819
The next day,
the Coast Guard found me alone.

01:07:17.421 --> 01:07:18.522
What about you?

01:07:20.824 --> 01:07:23.360
I was the first of
my friends to get a car.

01:07:27.497 --> 01:07:30.931
It was winter break
and we were having this...

01:07:30.933 --> 01:07:32.937
great night and...

01:07:35.272 --> 01:07:38.275
I wanted to take everybody out
on a joy ride.

01:07:42.279 --> 01:07:44.679
I was wasted.

01:07:46.784 --> 01:07:51.652
Me and 11 others were working
a mine in West Virginia...

01:07:51.654 --> 01:07:53.223
including
my little brother, Cal.

01:07:55.658 --> 01:07:59.694
There was a cave-in.
Occupational hazard.

01:07:59.696 --> 01:08:04.331
<i>Me and Cal got pinned
right next to each other.</i>

01:08:04.333 --> 01:08:06.537
<i>I couldn't see him,
but I could, uh...</i>

01:08:08.038 --> 01:08:11.342
<i>I could hear him
suffocating slowly.</i>

01:08:13.042 --> 01:08:14.912
I heard him
take his last breath.

01:08:16.380 --> 01:08:18.246
By the time
the rescue crew got there,

01:08:18.247 --> 01:08:20.680
I was the only one alive.

01:08:20.683 --> 01:08:25.152
They knew everything
about us...

01:08:25.154 --> 01:08:29.057
every goddamn detail.
I mean, they knew the jacket...

01:08:29.059 --> 01:08:31.158
that my roommate was wearing
on that boat.

01:08:31.161 --> 01:08:33.527
"Rudolph the Red-Nosed
Reindeer," that's the...

01:08:33.529 --> 01:08:35.331
song that was playing
when we crashed.

01:08:36.631 --> 01:08:38.532
They made
these rooms for us.

01:08:38.533 --> 01:08:41.335
They addressed the boxes
from people that we trust.

01:08:41.337 --> 01:08:43.675
My nephew texted me,
"Have a good time."

01:08:45.241 --> 01:08:49.046
- They hacked his goddamn phone.
- It's Danny's.

01:08:52.648 --> 01:08:55.450
Carbon monoxide poisoning.

01:08:55.452 --> 01:08:57.853
Everyone in his family
was killed but him.

01:08:57.854 --> 01:09:00.087
None of us died, right?

01:09:00.090 --> 01:09:02.057
- We're sole survivors.
- So what?

01:09:02.059 --> 01:09:04.461
We're a statistical
improbability.

01:09:06.261 --> 01:09:08.063
And now they want
to see who will be

01:09:08.064 --> 01:09:10.135
the luckiest
among the lucky.

01:09:14.438 --> 01:09:16.871
<i>Do you have the
heart to let Dr. Wootan Yu...</i>

01:09:16.872 --> 01:09:18.906
<i>help you become a better you?</i>

01:09:18.908 --> 01:09:21.642
<i>Open new doors
by testing your limits.</i>

01:09:21.644 --> 01:09:24.212
<i>Don't settle for
a humdrum existence.</i>

01:09:24.214 --> 01:09:26.348
<i>Live life to the extreme.</i>

01:09:26.350 --> 01:09:28.350
<i>Place your order
in the next five minutes</i>

01:09:28.352 --> 01:09:30.618
<i>and receive
a complimentary getaway.</i>

01:09:30.621 --> 01:09:33.386
Okay, well,
at least we know how much time we have.

01:09:33.389 --> 01:09:36.057
Yeah, knowing exactly when I'm
going to die is a huge comfort.

01:09:36.059 --> 01:09:37.893
Do you guys not understand?

01:09:37.895 --> 01:09:40.362
They chose us to die to see
who's the last person standing.

01:09:40.363 --> 01:09:42.630
We need you on board right now,
okay? Stay with us.

01:09:42.631 --> 01:09:44.899
We can't just keep
playing by their rules.

01:09:44.901 --> 01:09:47.067
What else are we supposed to do?
They're watching us.

01:09:47.069 --> 01:09:49.139
They know every move
that we're making.

01:09:50.573 --> 01:09:52.206
They're watching us.

01:09:59.248 --> 01:10:01.019
I've got something.

01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:05.390
Come on, come on.

01:10:08.658 --> 01:10:09.892
I got it. Here, here.

01:10:14.765 --> 01:10:16.764
Uh. Okay.
What do we have?

01:10:16.766 --> 01:10:19.302
A fist, one finger,
and two fingers. It could be...

01:10:19.304 --> 01:10:21.969
It could be zero, one, two,
right? Right? Like a code.

01:10:21.971 --> 01:10:24.139
No, no, no. It spells...

01:10:24.141 --> 01:10:28.075
E-K-G.

01:10:28.077 --> 01:10:30.745
Yeah, it's sign language.

01:10:30.748 --> 01:10:33.515
My cousin is deaf. They must
have known about that, too.

01:10:33.517 --> 01:10:35.482
Is there an EKG machine
here somewhere?

01:10:37.521 --> 01:10:39.486
Hey, what are you doing?

01:10:39.489 --> 01:10:41.424
Quantum Zeno effect.
Atoms won't change

01:10:41.426 --> 01:10:43.290
if you take
continuous measurements...

01:10:43.292 --> 01:10:44.960
so as long as
they're watching us,

01:10:44.962 --> 01:10:46.361
we can't change our state.

01:10:46.363 --> 01:10:48.330
The game is designed
so they always win.

01:10:51.769 --> 01:10:54.335
Okay, okay. We could really use
your help right now.

01:10:54.337 --> 01:10:56.137
No. We can find
another way out.

01:10:56.140 --> 01:10:57.539
We don't even
know the first way out.

01:10:57.541 --> 01:10:59.875
Just stop smashing shit
and take a deep breath.

01:10:59.877 --> 01:11:02.043
<i>Do you have the
heart to let Dr. Wootan Yu</i>

01:11:02.045 --> 01:11:04.145
<i>help you
become a better you?</i>

01:11:04.148 --> 01:11:06.714
Hey, Zoey,
you need to calm down.

01:11:08.985 --> 01:11:11.186
In three minutes,
they're going to poison us.

01:11:11.188 --> 01:11:13.188
We are running out of time here.
You've got to calm down.

01:11:13.190 --> 01:11:14.923
Stop telling me
to calm down, okay?

01:11:14.925 --> 01:11:16.892
You're not listening to me!

01:11:18.895 --> 01:11:21.729
You guys, it's an EKG machine.
Maybe this is our way out.

01:11:21.731 --> 01:11:24.665
- Ben, take your shirt off.
- What? Why me?

01:11:24.667 --> 01:11:26.566
Because it's the next clue,
that's why.

01:11:26.568 --> 01:11:28.236
Come on, it's just
an EKG machine.

01:11:28.238 --> 01:11:31.338
No, no. Nothing is just anything
in this hellhole.

01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:33.175
The right heart rate
could open a door, Ben.

01:11:33.177 --> 01:11:36.010
- We're running out of time.
- Hurry up.

01:11:36.012 --> 01:11:36.947
Just do it. Come on.

01:11:40.751 --> 01:11:43.920
Come on. Hold those, hold those.
Take a breath, take a breath.

01:11:47.323 --> 01:11:51.057
Your heart rate's too low.
Your heart rate's too low.

01:11:51.059 --> 01:11:53.593
It's not working.

01:11:53.595 --> 01:11:55.062
Somebody else
has to do it.

01:11:55.064 --> 01:11:57.531
Mike, we need a higher rate.
You've got to go.

01:11:57.533 --> 01:12:00.869
What? I'm not your guinea pig,
man. You do it. You try it.

01:12:00.871 --> 01:12:02.436
Look. Ben is fine,
man. Come on,

01:12:02.438 --> 01:12:04.638
I'll go next. We need
a higher rate. Come on.

01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:06.641
All right. Okay.
All right, let's do it.

01:12:06.643 --> 01:12:09.011
Zoey, please, just listen to me
for two seconds.

01:12:11.414 --> 01:12:12.815
Shit.

01:12:14.649 --> 01:12:17.353
We're in a metal box. Come on,
that's not going to help.

01:12:20.057 --> 01:12:22.723
Just stop smashing shit
and help me.

01:12:22.725 --> 01:12:25.059
Higher, higher, higher.
Come on!

01:12:25.061 --> 01:12:26.995
No.

01:12:26.997 --> 01:12:29.097
<i>Open new doors by
testing your limits.</i>

01:12:29.099 --> 01:12:31.266
Testing your limits.
Testing your limits.

01:12:31.268 --> 01:12:32.633
- We need a higher rate.
- You're kidding me.

01:12:32.635 --> 01:12:33.735
Man, I'm already
freaking out here.

01:12:33.737 --> 01:12:35.268
My heart rate's sky high.

01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:36.804
Want me to do some
burpees, jumping jacks?

01:12:36.806 --> 01:12:38.138
What do you want me to do?

01:12:38.141 --> 01:12:40.177
- We've got these.
- What are you, insane?

01:12:41.878 --> 01:12:44.378
When the Coast Guard found me
dying from hypothermia...

01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:45.780
my heart was half dead, man.

01:12:45.783 --> 01:12:47.414
These are what they used
to bring me back.

01:12:47.416 --> 01:12:48.616
Come on, this
is what they used.

01:12:48.618 --> 01:12:50.118
No, no.
That is not an option.

01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:51.887
Listen, it is a clue.
They put it in my room

01:12:51.889 --> 01:12:53.487
because they knew
I would know, Mike.

01:12:53.489 --> 01:12:55.656
Your heart's already high.
Man up, come on.

01:12:55.658 --> 01:12:57.325
Are you kidding me?
Get these away from me.

01:12:57.327 --> 01:12:59.996
Look at me, goddamn it!
Look at me!

01:12:59.998 --> 01:13:02.365
In one minute,
they're about to poison us.

01:13:02.367 --> 01:13:04.366
And we are going to
suffocate, all right?

01:13:04.368 --> 01:13:06.102
We're going to run out
of breathable air,

01:13:06.104 --> 01:13:07.134
just like you did
in that mine.

01:13:07.136 --> 01:13:08.335
Shit.

01:13:08.337 --> 01:13:10.005
You think about
your brother, Cal.

01:13:10.007 --> 01:13:14.276
Cal was his name, right?
This is your time.

01:13:14.278 --> 01:13:15.979
Mike, you can save us.

01:13:17.848 --> 01:13:20.681
This is it.
You could save us, Mike.

01:13:20.683 --> 01:13:22.615
- Now, save us.
- Okay.

01:13:22.617 --> 01:13:25.619
Do it. Do it, do it quick!
Come on, do it!

01:13:30.394 --> 01:13:31.691
- Jason, what are you doing?
- That's it.

01:13:31.693 --> 01:13:33.960
No. No.

01:13:33.962 --> 01:13:37.031
- Hey, don't. Stop!
- Get off me!

01:13:40.603 --> 01:13:41.869
You're going to kill him!

01:13:41.871 --> 01:13:44.105
Come on!

01:13:44.108 --> 01:13:46.607
Mike? What did you do?

01:13:46.609 --> 01:13:49.176
He stopped breathing!
Mike!

01:13:49.178 --> 01:13:53.347
Wake up! Mike.
Hey, stop! Stop!

01:13:53.349 --> 01:13:54.950
Come on!

01:13:54.952 --> 01:13:57.285
Come on, Mike!

01:13:57.287 --> 01:13:59.521
<i>Open new doors by
testing your limits.</i>

01:13:59.523 --> 01:14:00.689
Testing your limits.

01:14:06.329 --> 01:14:08.229
High and low. High and low.

01:14:08.231 --> 01:14:11.100
One, two.
Goddamn it. Fuck!

01:14:14.704 --> 01:14:15.606
Oh, shit.

01:14:17.006 --> 01:14:18.741
I don't actually know
how to do this.

01:14:21.010 --> 01:14:22.410
What the hell are you doing?

01:14:22.413 --> 01:14:24.815
Extremes.
Maybe they mean the low end.

01:14:32.756 --> 01:14:34.121
Hey, come on.

01:14:50.106 --> 01:14:51.475
Come on, man.

01:14:52.443 --> 01:14:55.110
Come on. Shit.

01:14:55.112 --> 01:14:56.111
Mike.

01:14:58.082 --> 01:14:59.149
Mike.

01:15:06.421 --> 01:15:09.193
The door. The door
is opening. It opened.

01:15:15.666 --> 01:15:17.101
Zoey. Hey!

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:18.936
Zoey!

01:15:20.603 --> 01:15:23.637
Zoey! Hey, come on.
There's a way out.

01:15:23.639 --> 01:15:25.906
This is the way out.

01:15:25.908 --> 01:15:27.974
You'll suffocate,
come on!

01:15:27.976 --> 01:15:28.945
Just go!

01:15:31.114 --> 01:15:32.549
- Please!
- Just go!

01:15:42.657 --> 01:15:44.458
Shit.

01:16:19.496 --> 01:16:21.265
We should have made her
come with us.

01:16:24.167 --> 01:16:26.468
We just left her there to die.

01:16:26.470 --> 01:16:27.701
She made her decision.

01:16:27.703 --> 01:16:29.870
What the hell
is wrong with you?

01:16:29.872 --> 01:16:31.473
What happened back there?

01:16:31.475 --> 01:16:34.178
I saved our asses.
You're welcome.

01:16:35.344 --> 01:16:36.880
You killed Mike.

01:16:40.184 --> 01:16:44.119
Sitting on his ass
12 hours a day killed him.

01:16:44.121 --> 01:16:47.024
If it wasn't that room,
it would've been the next.

01:16:50.193 --> 01:16:52.325
So that's just something
you do, isn't it?

01:16:52.327 --> 01:16:53.627
Your friend on the boat?

01:16:53.629 --> 01:16:55.866
What are you saying,
Ben? Huh?

01:16:59.335 --> 01:17:01.468
Use your words.

01:17:01.471 --> 01:17:04.237
One jacket
between the two of you.

01:17:04.239 --> 01:17:05.873
Give me your jacket!

01:17:05.875 --> 01:17:09.078
It's pretty convenient
that he just swam off and died.

01:17:11.013 --> 01:17:13.379
You don't want
to do this, man.

01:17:13.381 --> 01:17:16.620
You being the sole survivor
had nothing to do with luck.

01:17:18.287 --> 01:17:19.853
Admit it.

01:17:19.856 --> 01:17:22.826
You killed him! Admit that
you killed your friend.

01:17:24.926 --> 01:17:26.729
Surviving is a choice!

01:17:28.564 --> 01:17:30.435
Make yours.

01:17:34.903 --> 01:17:37.573
Keep your eyes open
and look for clues.

01:17:40.077 --> 01:17:42.578
Hey, it's a hatch.

01:17:46.582 --> 01:17:48.782
I guess
we just open it.

01:17:48.785 --> 01:17:50.586
What are we letting in?

01:17:52.755 --> 01:17:54.158
Fine, I'll do it.

01:17:55.657 --> 01:17:57.826
- It's heavy.
- Come on, try harder.

01:17:57.828 --> 01:17:59.827
Asshole, I don't go
to the gym every day.

01:17:59.829 --> 01:18:01.265
Goddamn it.

01:18:09.671 --> 01:18:11.340
Come on, come on.

01:18:17.213 --> 01:18:19.380
What's this shit on my hands?

01:18:26.421 --> 01:18:28.324
I don't feel so good.

01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:32.627
Hey, hey.

01:18:32.629 --> 01:18:36.298
They put something
on the handle.

01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:40.302
Hey, you're melting.
You're melting.

01:18:40.304 --> 01:18:42.736
- What?
- You're melting.

01:18:42.738 --> 01:18:46.173
What? Wait. Look, look.
It says something.

01:18:46.175 --> 01:18:50.244
"Feel free to leave,
but may we note...

01:18:50.246 --> 01:18:53.682
it's best to
find the antidote."

01:18:53.684 --> 01:18:56.284
How the hell are
we supposed to do that?

01:19:05.162 --> 01:19:06.927
Get up and look,
goddamn it!

01:19:06.929 --> 01:19:10.197
Who cares, man?
We're going to die here anyway.

01:19:10.199 --> 01:19:12.633
I'm not going to die.
I'm not going to die.

01:19:21.210 --> 01:19:22.676
Okay.

01:19:26.350 --> 01:19:29.884
Where is it? Come on.
Come on. Where is it?

01:19:29.886 --> 01:19:32.955
- Where is this bastard?
- Where is it?

01:19:39.495 --> 01:19:41.265
Ben. Ben.

01:19:45.434 --> 01:19:47.567
- I have the anti...
- Give me that!

01:20:04.353 --> 01:20:05.889
It's mine!

01:20:45.295 --> 01:20:46.727
Shit.

01:20:52.367 --> 01:20:54.137
Oh, shit.

01:21:13.288 --> 01:21:15.191
Oh, my God.

01:21:17.795 --> 01:21:20.660
Okay, I've got ten numbers,
four spots.

01:21:20.662 --> 01:21:22.263
I need a four-digit code.

01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:28.134
Entering room five.
Stand by.

01:21:28.136 --> 01:21:30.437
<i>Standing by.</i>

01:21:30.439 --> 01:21:32.676
We have two bodies. Over.

01:21:34.110 --> 01:21:35.479
<i>Copy.</i>

01:21:37.381 --> 01:21:41.181
<i>20 minutes for disposal
and cleanup. Over.</i>

01:21:41.184 --> 01:21:42.986
Copy. Out.

01:21:47.123 --> 01:21:49.558
Look at that,
the oxygen mask.

01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:51.724
What the hell was she going
to do with that?

01:21:51.726 --> 01:21:53.326
Breathe, bitch!

01:22:17.819 --> 01:22:18.721
Shit.

01:23:22.083 --> 01:23:24.718
<i>Now, you were a dark horse.</i>

01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:26.554
<i>My money was on Jason.</i>

01:23:26.556 --> 01:23:29.423
<i>But, see, that's why these
games are so fascinating.</i>

01:23:29.425 --> 01:23:31.258
<i>Somehow, after being burnt,</i>

01:23:31.260 --> 01:23:33.627
<i>frozen, poisoned,
and crippled...</i>

01:23:33.629 --> 01:23:37.231
<i>you still managed
to escape the final room.</i>

01:23:37.233 --> 01:23:39.900
<i>Did you ever think
you had that in you?</i>

01:23:39.902 --> 01:23:43.273
<i>That adrenaline,
that drive?</i>

01:23:44.307 --> 01:23:47.074
Sit down. Celebrate.

01:23:47.076 --> 01:23:49.813
You won
something for once.

01:23:51.613 --> 01:23:54.481
So, you're the psycho that
designed this murder maze, huh?

01:23:54.484 --> 01:23:56.816
No, I'm the Games Master.

01:23:56.818 --> 01:23:59.085
The Puzzle Maker
designs the rooms.

01:23:59.087 --> 01:24:02.892
But you kill people for fun.
There's nothing good left on TV?

01:24:04.127 --> 01:24:06.127
You killed all your friends...

01:24:06.130 --> 01:24:08.529
because you didn't want to pay
for a goddamn cab.

01:24:08.531 --> 01:24:11.764
I wouldn't get too comfortable
on that high horse, Ben.

01:24:11.766 --> 01:24:13.600
From the beginning
of civilization...

01:24:13.602 --> 01:24:15.835
we've known there
was something captivating...

01:24:15.837 --> 01:24:18.339
about watching human beings
fight for their lives.

01:24:18.341 --> 01:24:21.975
That's why we watch gladiator
games, public executions...

01:24:21.977 --> 01:24:23.878
rubber-necking
on the freeway.

01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:25.347
But now
the world's gone soft.

01:24:25.349 --> 01:24:28.349
Everything is safe.
Everything is careful.

01:24:28.351 --> 01:24:30.284
So, we created a sport
for people

01:24:30.286 --> 01:24:32.521
who still have
a thirst for savagery...

01:24:32.523 --> 01:24:35.155
and we provided them
with a box seat

01:24:35.158 --> 01:24:36.994
for life's ultimate drama.

01:24:41.596 --> 01:24:44.098
<i>Our customers are some
of the most powerful</i>

01:24:44.100 --> 01:24:46.200
<i>people in the world.</i>

01:24:46.202 --> 01:24:49.303
But every year,
they demand more.

01:24:49.305 --> 01:24:52.806
More complicated rooms.

01:24:52.809 --> 01:24:54.674
More interesting subjects.

01:24:54.676 --> 01:24:57.977
More ways to gamble on
life and death.

01:24:57.979 --> 01:25:01.981
Last year,
they had college athletes...

01:25:01.983 --> 01:25:03.984
the year before,
savants...

01:25:03.986 --> 01:25:06.887
and this year
we had lone survivors.

01:25:06.889 --> 01:25:10.691
They wanted to know if luck
had anything to do with it.

01:25:10.693 --> 01:25:15.662
Lucky people don't get kidnapped
and tortured by psychopaths.

01:25:15.664 --> 01:25:17.397
You know,
it's kind of hurtful

01:25:17.399 --> 01:25:19.268
when you call someone
a psychopath, huh?

01:25:23.507 --> 01:25:25.739
I thought it was stupid, too.

01:25:25.741 --> 01:25:27.473
But here you are...

01:25:27.475 --> 01:25:30.046
our lowest-odds ever to win...

01:25:31.546 --> 01:25:33.847
still alive.

01:25:33.850 --> 01:25:37.116
I really didn't think
it was possible...

01:25:37.118 --> 01:25:38.552
but as I said...

01:25:38.554 --> 01:25:39.922
you were the long shot.

01:25:45.728 --> 01:25:48.096
So I won.

01:25:49.398 --> 01:25:51.769
That means I get
to go home, right?

01:25:56.707 --> 01:25:58.805
Ben...

01:25:58.807 --> 01:26:00.875
at the end of
the Kentucky Derby...

01:26:00.877 --> 01:26:02.980
do you think
the horse gets a prize?

01:26:14.389 --> 01:26:15.622
Shh...

01:26:15.624 --> 01:26:17.025
Shh, shh...

01:26:35.877 --> 01:26:38.078
Hey. Hey, Ben.

01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:41.250
Come on. Hey, Ben,
come on. Come on.

01:26:56.264 --> 01:26:58.331
Ben.

01:26:58.333 --> 01:27:00.901
Ben.

01:27:00.903 --> 01:27:03.837
Ben, come on, get up.
Ben, come on, get up.

01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:06.943
No!

01:27:12.849 --> 01:27:16.783
You can't leave until
we finish our game, Zoey.

01:27:24.827 --> 01:27:27.563
Okay, we have
to make sure that...

01:27:30.499 --> 01:27:32.069
He's dead.

01:27:42.478 --> 01:27:44.846
Okay. Come on.
Come on.

01:27:46.248 --> 01:27:48.216
Come on,
there's a service elevator.

01:27:52.822 --> 01:27:55.255
You came back for me.

01:27:55.257 --> 01:27:58.294
Yeah, well, I'm tired
of being the only survivor.

01:28:02.198 --> 01:28:04.867
- Zoey, go, go.
- Okay.

01:28:14.609 --> 01:28:17.277
It's been 24 hours.
He's stable now.

01:28:17.279 --> 01:28:19.047
You should get some rest.

01:28:21.217 --> 01:28:23.049
He's ready.

01:28:23.051 --> 01:28:25.252
<i>Dr. Bell,
please come to the OR.</i>

01:28:25.254 --> 01:28:26.657
<i>Dr. Bell, OR, please.</i>

01:28:28.024 --> 01:28:29.924
Miss Davis?

01:28:29.926 --> 01:28:32.261
Are you feeling well enough
to come with me?

01:28:35.598 --> 01:28:39.165
Yeah, you're right, we'll have
to check that for roof access.

01:28:51.681 --> 01:28:54.283
All right, everyone, 360.

01:28:56.018 --> 01:28:57.453
Miss Davis.

01:29:06.896 --> 01:29:10.731
Wait, this was
the waiting room. Okay?

01:29:10.733 --> 01:29:13.701
And then it turned
into a giant oven, okay?

01:29:13.703 --> 01:29:17.137
And there was fire. The fire
came down from the ceiling.

01:29:17.140 --> 01:29:20.643
We haven't found any evidence
of the things you've described.

01:29:21.877 --> 01:29:24.777
That. Look.
This was the duct.

01:29:24.779 --> 01:29:26.714
There was a painting
that came down.

01:29:26.716 --> 01:29:29.281
Have you ever seen things
that weren't there before?

01:29:29.283 --> 01:29:33.152
I am not imagining
this, okay?

01:29:33.155 --> 01:29:35.121
Look, Ben was there, too.

01:29:35.123 --> 01:29:37.259
He'll tell you all this
when he wakes up.

01:29:37.261 --> 01:29:39.959
Right.
Your friend, Ben Miller?

01:29:39.961 --> 01:29:42.097
We got a report
from the hospital.

01:29:42.099 --> 01:29:43.864
They found traces
of three different

01:29:43.866 --> 01:29:47.167
illegal substances
in his bloodstream.

01:29:47.170 --> 01:29:48.703
"No way out."

01:29:51.940 --> 01:29:54.008
- Miss Davis.
- It's an anagram.

01:29:54.010 --> 01:29:56.343
<i>Dr. Wootan Yu.</i>

01:29:56.345 --> 01:29:59.545
<i>Do you have the heart
to let Dr. Wootan Yu help you...</i>

01:29:59.548 --> 01:30:01.147
No way out. Wootan Yu.

01:30:01.149 --> 01:30:04.552
- "Wootan Yu" is "No way out."
- Miss Davis.

01:30:04.554 --> 01:30:06.352
No way out, Wootan Yu.

01:30:06.354 --> 01:30:10.990
This. Look.
That was a part of the game.

01:30:10.992 --> 01:30:13.692
This is part of the game!

01:30:13.694 --> 01:30:15.666
We've got to vacate
the premises.

01:30:24.805 --> 01:30:28.374
Wootan Yu. Wootan Yu.

01:30:45.126 --> 01:30:46.527
Thank you.

01:30:47.963 --> 01:30:50.463
So, are you going to tell me
what's going on?

01:30:50.465 --> 01:30:54.301
I am the new regional sales rep
for all of Logan Square.

01:30:54.303 --> 01:30:57.204
I'm officially client facing.
It's for vegan dog food...

01:30:57.206 --> 01:30:59.405
but, you know,
you've got to start somewhere.

01:30:59.407 --> 01:31:01.344
I'm really proud of you.

01:31:04.379 --> 01:31:05.281
Is that homework?

01:31:12.220 --> 01:31:13.687
What is this?

01:31:13.689 --> 01:31:16.557
Mike Nolan died of
a heart attack

01:31:16.559 --> 01:31:18.725
in a bathroom
in Union Station.

01:31:18.727 --> 01:31:22.596
Jason Walker was thrown
from his bike on the I-64...

01:31:22.598 --> 01:31:24.200
DMT found in his system.

01:31:25.567 --> 01:31:27.902
Danny Khan
drowns in Lake Michigan.

01:31:27.904 --> 01:31:30.005
Amanda Harper,
rock-climbing alone,

01:31:30.007 --> 01:31:32.504
because that makes sense...

01:31:32.506 --> 01:31:34.609
falls and dies.

01:31:36.044 --> 01:31:38.779
There would have been
articles for us, too.

01:31:38.781 --> 01:31:40.380
You've got to
let this shit go.

01:31:40.382 --> 01:31:43.918
I can't just pretend
that they never existed.

01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:46.487
Everyone else who was sent
those invitations died...

01:31:46.489 --> 01:31:49.290
and whoever sent them
is still out there.

01:31:49.292 --> 01:31:52.660
Don't you want answers?
We can find them.

01:31:52.662 --> 01:31:55.895
They rigged the game so
that we would lose and we won.

01:31:55.897 --> 01:31:59.266
We beat them
at their own game.

01:31:59.268 --> 01:32:01.137
I didn't have a lot
to go on, but...

01:32:02.838 --> 01:32:05.004
the logo...

01:32:05.006 --> 01:32:07.508
it's an impossible object.

01:32:07.510 --> 01:32:09.943
It's an Escher staircase
that turns in on itself.

01:32:09.945 --> 01:32:12.078
It's totally unique.

01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:15.347
The numbers are in a pattern
on the staircase.

01:32:15.349 --> 01:32:19.519
23, 22 in a repeated sequence
of right angles.

01:32:19.521 --> 01:32:21.522
They're coordinates...

01:32:21.524 --> 01:32:23.323
for an unlisted
industrial building

01:32:23.325 --> 01:32:24.657
in the middle
of Manhattan.

01:32:24.659 --> 01:32:26.125
They're hiding
in plain sight.

01:32:26.127 --> 01:32:28.861
What are we supposed
to do with that?

01:32:28.864 --> 01:32:32.165
- I bought us plane tickets.
- Plane tickets?

01:32:32.167 --> 01:32:33.701
Two weeks, I'm going.

01:32:33.703 --> 01:32:36.770
Zoey, it's called
"survivor's guilt."

01:32:36.772 --> 01:32:40.473
My therapist says that in order
to live, you need to move on.

01:32:40.475 --> 01:32:43.811
Moving on
doesn't mean running.

01:32:43.813 --> 01:32:46.914
And I'm done running.
Are you in?

01:32:48.649 --> 01:32:50.985
All right.

01:32:50.987 --> 01:32:53.788
Yeah, I'm in.
Let's do it.

01:32:55.190 --> 01:32:57.492
You're not Jason Bourne,
though.

01:33:00.195 --> 01:33:02.495
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

01:33:07.270 --> 01:33:09.134
Come on.
It's got to be in here.

01:33:14.510 --> 01:33:18.044
Found it!
X marks the spot.

01:33:18.046 --> 01:33:19.682
Come on, come on,
where is it?

01:33:21.951 --> 01:33:24.784
This has to be it, right?
I've got the tool!

01:33:28.123 --> 01:33:30.522
Right here. It must connect
to the bolt we found.

01:33:30.524 --> 01:33:31.825
Okay.

01:33:31.828 --> 01:33:34.027
Try it on the door.
See if it'll turn.

01:33:34.029 --> 01:33:35.163
You can do it.

01:33:37.399 --> 01:33:39.633
- Anything?
- It's not going!

01:33:39.635 --> 01:33:41.633
- See if you can turn it.
- It's not working!

01:33:41.635 --> 01:33:42.870
- Try clockwise.
- Clockwise?

01:33:42.872 --> 01:33:44.207
- Yeah, clockwise!
- Okay.

01:33:45.639 --> 01:33:47.140
- Something happened here.
- What?

01:33:47.142 --> 01:33:48.808
- <i>Terrain, terrain.</i>
- What's this?

01:33:48.810 --> 01:33:50.243
No, it's another riddle.

01:33:50.245 --> 01:33:52.712
"I fly without wings,
I cry without eyes."

01:33:52.714 --> 01:33:54.948
- What does that mean?
- I don't know. Give me a second!

01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:56.218
Heads down!

01:33:57.787 --> 01:34:00.087
Brace for impact!

01:34:00.089 --> 01:34:01.922
- Wait, "cloud"! Try "cloud"!
- "Cloud"?

01:34:01.924 --> 01:34:05.025
- Yeah, "cloud."
- Okay.

01:34:05.027 --> 01:34:06.926
Try the door!
Come on, let's go!

01:34:06.928 --> 01:34:09.196
<i>Pull up. Caution, terrain.
Decision height.</i>

01:34:09.198 --> 01:34:10.531
<i>Terrain, terrain. Pull up.</i>

01:34:10.533 --> 01:34:12.398
No, no! Come on! Come on!

01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:13.800
<i>Caution, terrain.
Terrain, terrain.</i>

01:34:13.802 --> 01:34:15.603
Do something!

01:34:15.605 --> 01:34:18.074
<i>Pull up.
Decision height. Pull up.</i>

01:34:21.810 --> 01:34:25.079
Ending sim.
Do you want to reset?

01:34:25.081 --> 01:34:29.018
<i>No.
Good work. We're ready for game time.</i>

01:34:30.952 --> 01:34:34.255
I hurt my goddamn hand
on that bolt again, Larry.

01:34:34.257 --> 01:34:36.793
<i>Deboard the simulator.</i>

01:34:43.297 --> 01:34:45.565
<i>What's the
probability of survival?</i>

01:34:45.567 --> 01:34:47.801
It's approximately
four percent.

01:34:47.804 --> 01:34:51.638
<i>Well, it's not a game
if she doesn't stand any chance.</i>

01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:55.276
<i>We've intercepted her
flight information. It's on.</i>

01:34:55.278 --> 01:35:00.079
<i>I'm so glad Zoey got over
her fear of flying.</i>

01:35:00.081 --> 01:35:02.150
<i>Let's play again.</i>
