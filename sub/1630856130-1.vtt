This is Henry Hackford

02:45.295 --> 02:47.602
of the Metropolitan Museum
of Art.

02:47.602 --> 02:48.951
Uh, it's an honor
to meet you, sir.

02:48.951 --> 02:50.518
Nice to meet you, too.

02:50.518 --> 02:52.607
I'd like you to take him
through your new catalog.

02:52.607 --> 02:54.565
The Museum are
potential purchasers

02:54.565 --> 02:56.480
of many of your treasures.

02:56.480 --> 02:57.916
Yes, right.

02:57.916 --> 03:00.354
Um, I'm just kind of late
for something. It's...

03:01.920 --> 03:03.748
Okay. Sure, sure.

03:03.748 --> 03:05.489
Oh, it'd be a pleasure, sir.

03:05.489 --> 03:06.795
Of course. Thank you.

03:06.795 --> 03:09.276
Thank you.

03:09.276 --> 03:11.713
Why are you
carrying such an ugly bear?

03:15.891 --> 03:17.588
It's a particular focus
on cartography

03:17.588 --> 03:19.242
and the natural world.

03:19.242 --> 03:22.506
I'm really proud
of the breadth and...

03:22.506 --> 03:24.682
range of pieces
we've got in this sale.

03:24.682 --> 03:27.424
Thank you.

04:31.793 --> 04:33.577
Hello, Bernard.

04:33.577 --> 04:35.971
Um, I-I'm so sorry.

04:35.971 --> 04:38.060
I-- Let-let me just
explain everything.

04:38.060 --> 04:40.628
I already know what happened.

04:40.628 --> 04:42.847
It was,
"Of course, Mr. Flaxman,"

04:42.847 --> 04:45.067
and work, work, work.

04:45.067 --> 04:46.982
And you missed
your daughter's birthday.

04:46.982 --> 04:48.418
I mean--

04:48.418 --> 04:50.594
Uh, yes, t-that's
pretty much it.

04:50.594 --> 04:53.118
Really, I'm so sorry, I ju--

04:53.118 --> 04:55.991
Okay. Should I wake her up

04:55.991 --> 04:58.341
so you can give her
your present?

05:00.561 --> 05:02.432
Yeah, uh, yeah.

05:02.432 --> 05:04.347
Yeah, yeah, of course, um...

05:04.347 --> 05:05.827
Uh, just give me one second.

05:05.827 --> 05:08.351
I just, uh, I just need to
sort something.

05:19.667 --> 05:21.364
Oh. Hey.

05:21.364 --> 05:22.974
Hey. Hey, sweetheart.

05:22.974 --> 05:26.456
Happy birthday!

05:26.456 --> 05:27.849
Huh? Okay. Yep.

05:27.849 --> 05:31.896
Um, well, I...
I got this for you.

05:32.897 --> 05:34.508
Groceries?

05:34.508 --> 05:36.640
No, no, uh, let me just
help you with that.

05:40.688 --> 05:43.386
It's a jewelry box,
golden jewelry box.

05:43.386 --> 05:44.866
Unbelievable, Bernie.

05:46.650 --> 05:48.522
I think it's stuck.

05:48.522 --> 05:51.133
Uh, oh, this is
your first antique.

05:51.133 --> 05:52.482
Isn't it pretty?

05:52.482 --> 05:54.136
Sweetie, why don't, um...

05:54.136 --> 05:56.181
you go to your room and pack
a bag for Grandma's, okay?

05:56.181 --> 05:57.705
Okay.

06:01.012 --> 06:04.451
Oh, Bernie.

06:04.451 --> 06:06.888
What are we gonna do? I, um...

06:06.888 --> 06:10.718
I think I'm gonna take Eve
to my mom's like we planned,

06:10.718 --> 06:14.156
but, uh... I'm just gonna
need some time there.

06:14.156 --> 06:17.028
At least through
the holidays and...

06:17.028 --> 06:19.683
I-I think it's best
if you don't come.

06:19.683 --> 06:22.686
What?

06:22.686 --> 06:24.601
Julie, no-- please,
y-you're kidding.

06:24.601 --> 06:25.733
Please be kidding.

06:25.733 --> 06:27.865
No, Bernie, I am so not kidding.

06:27.865 --> 06:30.999
This is the least funny
conversation of my life.

06:30.999 --> 06:33.784
It's been going on
for such a long time.

06:33.784 --> 06:35.046
It's like...

06:35.046 --> 06:37.005
It's like you've
forgotten who we are.

06:37.005 --> 06:38.615
And what a family means. And I--

06:38.615 --> 06:41.139
I'm really sorry about the box.

06:41.139 --> 06:44.621
What she really wanted for
her birthday was a dollhouse.

06:44.621 --> 06:47.668
Though I'm sure an hour of
her dad's undivided attention

06:47.668 --> 06:49.452
would've been just as good.

06:50.497 --> 06:53.500
Bernie, it is one thing
to drop the ball with me,

06:53.500 --> 06:54.849
but with Eve?

07:00.158 --> 07:02.030
I'll be back, okay?

07:03.901 --> 07:05.555
You missed my birthday.

07:05.555 --> 07:08.123
Oh, I'm--
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.

07:08.123 --> 07:11.256
Mom says you're
a selfish bastard.

07:11.256 --> 07:13.824
S-She was joking.

I got home yesterday,

I'd missed
my daughter's birthday.

08:03.831 --> 08:06.050
And then, my wife,

uh, she decided

I-I honestly don't know, sir.
I hope so.

08:38.561 --> 08:40.824

one step further?

08:40.824 --> 08:43.000
What if we extend
this sabbatical

08:43.000 --> 08:46.177

08:58.929 --> 09:01.323
All right. It sort of sounds

09:01.323 --> 09:04.195
Yes, I suppose I am.

09:05.762 --> 09:07.677
You're a very evil person, sir.

09:07.677 --> 09:10.811
Or a very clever businessman.

I can tell by looking at you.

09:50.807 --> 09:52.069
It's making me sad.

09:52.069 --> 09:53.984
Okay, well, sorry
to be a downer.

09:53.984 --> 09:55.943
No, no, you want to talk? You
want me to get another chair?

You want to-- I g--
I'm reading this great book.

09:58.075 --> 09:59.381
This might be helpful.

09:59.381 --> 10:01.209
It's a book
about parallel universes.

10:01.209 --> 10:02.863
You know about this?

in another universe,

10:06.736 --> 10:08.738

That's uplifting.

Is it not?

10:12.742 --> 10:14.091
Do you-- What are you doing
for Christmas?

10:14.091 --> 10:15.440
You want to come over?

10:15.440 --> 10:17.312
You can hang out with the cats.
It's fun.

10:17.312 --> 10:20.141
You watch them, they fight.
There's one that lives outside.

10:20.141 --> 10:22.317
Y-You're very kind, but...

11:38.393 --> 11:41.135
Oh, my God!

11:41.135 --> 11:43.180
You'd think I'd get used to it,

11:43.180 --> 11:44.747
but I never do.

11:46.183 --> 11:49.056
Okay, no, no, no,
you stay back, just stay back.

11:49.056 --> 11:50.535
I-I don't want to hurt you,

11:50.535 --> 11:52.276
but I will hurt you

11:52.276 --> 11:54.888
if you-- if you don't
get out of here.

11:54.888 --> 11:56.367
No, no, no.

11:56.367 --> 11:58.152
H-Help!

11:58.152 --> 12:00.284
Oh, no. It's fine. What do
you want? What do you want?

12:00.284 --> 12:01.764
Seriously, you can
take everything.

12:01.764 --> 12:03.897
Oh, you're just
wailing and crying

12:03.897 --> 12:05.376
like a little baby goat.

12:05.376 --> 12:07.378
- Uh, I don't know what you're--

12:07.378 --> 12:09.337
I-I don't-- I wish-- I wish
I understood what you're saying.

12:19.782 --> 12:21.349
Is this better?

12:21.349 --> 12:23.960
Is it-- Yeah, I mean, yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.

12:23.960 --> 12:27.572
Okay. Then let's get to it.

12:27.572 --> 12:30.184
Your wish is my command.

12:30.184 --> 12:32.403
Yeah, okay, yeah, no.

12:32.403 --> 12:34.101
That's funny 'cause of the--

12:34.101 --> 12:35.450
I wish you'd stop
trying to kill me.

12:35.450 --> 12:37.800
Oh, this? No, this is--

12:37.800 --> 12:39.802
That's just force of habit.

12:39.802 --> 12:41.891
Who are you?
How'd you get into my house?

12:41.891 --> 12:43.893
Oh, wh--

12:43.893 --> 12:45.852
I was in the box.

12:45.852 --> 12:47.331
O-Okay, sure.

12:47.331 --> 12:49.159
Listen, uh, look,
I-I don't judge you,

12:49.159 --> 12:51.074
or whatever recreational
prescription drug

12:51.074 --> 12:52.989
of choice you've taken.

12:52.989 --> 12:55.818
Just don't touch that. I-I need
you to get out of my house.

12:55.818 --> 12:59.169
Okay? Seriously,
how did you get in?

12:59.169 --> 13:02.390
Okay, I'm going
to talk slower for you.

13:02.390 --> 13:04.479
That box...

13:04.479 --> 13:07.221
that you were rubbing...

13:07.221 --> 13:10.006
I was in it.

13:10.006 --> 13:11.834
Okay, sure.

13:11.834 --> 13:13.270
Sure, and how-- and how do you

13:13.270 --> 13:16.056
get inside a box
that's nine inches wide?

13:16.056 --> 13:18.841
Really good question.
It's a really simple answer.

13:18.841 --> 13:21.409
You know, classic setup.

13:24.629 --> 13:26.153
Angry sorcerer.

13:30.940 --> 13:32.333
You know, crazy eyes.

13:32.333 --> 13:34.204
- Pointed a finger at me.

13:34.204 --> 13:36.467
Puff of smoke. Spinning and
turning trough time and space.

13:39.557 --> 13:41.516
<i>The next thing I know,</i>

13:41.516 --> 13:44.040
I'm inside this stupid box.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.346
Okay, wow, wow.

13:45.346 --> 13:46.869
I know!

13:46.869 --> 13:48.305
Now, that's a strong move.

13:48.305 --> 13:50.264
The "I'm a genie"
home invasion excuse, that's--

13:50.264 --> 13:51.874
It's not an excuse.

13:51.874 --> 13:53.136
I am a genie.

13:53.136 --> 13:54.877
Right, yeah.

13:54.877 --> 13:55.965
- Right, right, right.
- Mm-hmm.

13:55.965 --> 13:56.966
Damn.

13:56.966 --> 13:58.446
I mean, the whole thing is--

13:58.446 --> 14:00.535
No, no, no, you-you...

14:00.535 --> 14:02.972
- Back off.
- Okay. All right.

14:02.972 --> 14:04.408
Let's just...

14:04.408 --> 14:07.977
You make wishes,
and then I make them come true.

14:07.977 --> 14:10.632
That's how
this whole thing works.

14:10.632 --> 14:12.939
Okay, so you're saying
you're an actual genie.

14:12.939 --> 14:15.942
- Correct. We're like ghosts.
- Sure.

14:15.942 --> 14:19.336
Or-or dragons or unicorns.

14:19.336 --> 14:20.685
You know, it's like
you-you think we don't exist,

14:20.685 --> 14:22.383
and then you bump into one
and you're like,

14:22.383 --> 14:24.167
"Oh, hey. Oh, look at that.
A genie, genie, genie.

14:24.167 --> 14:25.212
Genies everywhere."

14:25.212 --> 14:26.517
Okay, well, you better get

14:26.517 --> 14:28.693
your next alibi ready
pretty quick.

14:28.693 --> 14:30.565
Okay, how about this?
Um, I-I wish...

14:30.565 --> 14:31.653
Bring it.

14:31.653 --> 14:33.350
...that my phone wasn't dead.

14:33.350 --> 14:36.005
A-And, oh, I know.
How about a camel?

14:36.005 --> 14:37.398
I wish I had my very own camel.

14:37.398 --> 14:39.008
Huh? That seems
reasonable, right?

14:39.008 --> 14:40.357
Sure thing, boss.

14:40.357 --> 14:43.012
It's whatever floats your boat.

14:45.406 --> 14:47.364
Okay, uh...

14:47.364 --> 14:49.366
I mean, that's
a coincidence. The...

14:49.366 --> 14:50.628
Hmm.

14:50.628 --> 14:52.195
Is that a coincidence?

14:57.461 --> 15:00.116
Okay, I-I-I take back
the camel wish. I take it back.

15:00.116 --> 15:02.379
Everybody always takes
the camel wish back.

15:04.512 --> 15:06.209
Oh, my God.

15:06.209 --> 15:10.039
T-That is
interesting, though. The...

15:15.740 --> 15:18.221
I just don't want Eve
growing up with a dad

15:18.221 --> 15:19.962
who never seems
to put her first.

15:19.962 --> 15:22.051
I had to push back
at some point.

15:22.051 --> 15:24.227
- That's right.

15:24.227 --> 15:26.534
God, the problem
with Bernard is...

15:27.535 --> 15:29.624
And you know I still love him.

15:29.624 --> 15:32.453
But the problem is that
he thinks everything

15:32.453 --> 15:34.150
will just be okay in the end.

15:34.150 --> 15:35.456
Hmm.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.461
He is my guy,

15:40.461 --> 15:42.419
but...

15:42.419 --> 15:44.987
he just won't live
in the real world.

15:47.076 --> 15:48.773
Wow. This is so cool.

15:48.773 --> 15:50.645
Oh, my grandma always
used to say,

15:50.645 --> 15:52.168
"You don't get nothing
for free."

15:52.168 --> 15:53.517
I wish she could see me now.

15:53.517 --> 15:55.302
Hello, Bernard.

15:56.607 --> 16:00.089
Oh, look at you.
You're as thin as a rake.

16:00.089 --> 16:02.178
Okay, on second thought,
no hard feelings, Grandma,

16:02.178 --> 16:03.310
I wish she couldn't.

16:03.310 --> 16:05.094
Got it.

16:05.094 --> 16:07.270
I-I did not like that.

16:07.270 --> 16:09.185
- Okay, so wait, am I...

16:09.185 --> 16:11.666
Have I blown it already?
Am I already out of wishes?

16:11.666 --> 16:14.103
No, keep at it.

16:14.103 --> 16:15.365
What about the whole
three wishes thing?

16:15.365 --> 16:17.280
Fairytale stuff.

16:17.280 --> 16:20.588
Real genies, unlimited wishes.

16:20.588 --> 16:22.111
Wow, we have to be very careful,
don't we?

16:22.111 --> 16:24.548
Uh, you do.
If you want my advice,

16:24.548 --> 16:27.464
I would say
use the words "I wish"

16:27.464 --> 16:30.032
with the caution that you
would usually reserve

16:30.032 --> 16:31.468
for "please castrate me."

16:31.468 --> 16:32.687
Just, you know.

16:35.820 --> 16:38.432
Oh.

16:38.432 --> 16:40.129
What?

16:40.129 --> 16:42.088
- Problem?
- What? N-No, no. Me? No problem.

16:42.088 --> 16:43.611
No, blow away.

16:43.611 --> 16:45.787
I-I just suppose a lot
of things have changed

16:45.787 --> 16:47.223
since you were last out.

16:47.223 --> 16:49.051
- Always do.
- Oh.

16:49.051 --> 16:50.444
It's different
every single time.

16:50.444 --> 16:52.228
Wow, so you've been
out of the box before?

16:52.228 --> 16:54.404
Oh, yeah. I mean, here
and there, yeah. But, I mean...

16:54.404 --> 16:56.493
I don't know,
from the looks of this place,

16:56.493 --> 17:00.062
I'm thinking, this time,
it's been a really long one.

17:00.062 --> 17:01.672
I mean, give or take
a day or two,

17:01.672 --> 17:03.457
if-if-if my dating on the box
is right... -Yeah. Okay.

17:03.457 --> 17:06.808
I'd-I'd say about...
2,000 years.

17:06.808 --> 17:08.331
2,000 years?

17:08.331 --> 17:10.507
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay.

17:10.507 --> 17:13.162
That's new information to me.

17:13.162 --> 17:15.251
- Is it?
- That's... Yeah.

17:15.251 --> 17:18.080
All right, well...

17:18.080 --> 17:19.690
Let's just get to work.

17:19.690 --> 17:23.172
Just hit me.
You know, tell me what you want.

17:23.172 --> 17:24.434
Is it girls?

17:24.434 --> 17:26.436
Gold? Golden girls?

17:26.436 --> 17:28.830
- Extra girls in gold, or what?
- Yeah, no, no,

17:28.830 --> 17:30.397
- come on. That's...
- Well, I mean,

17:30.397 --> 17:31.789
you don't have to be embarrassed.

17:31.789 --> 17:34.227
I know the score. You know?
I make you rich,

17:34.227 --> 17:35.793
you go live in a palace,
you get five wives,

17:35.793 --> 17:37.534
you start to get fat,
then you get mad at me,

17:37.534 --> 17:39.493
- and you put me back in the box.
- No, no.

17:39.493 --> 17:40.668
You've actually got me
all wrong.

17:40.668 --> 17:43.236
Uh, money can't help me. It's...

17:43.236 --> 17:45.542
Uh...

17:45.542 --> 17:49.416
My wife and kid, they-they
just left for her mum's

17:49.416 --> 17:51.853
and looks like it might be
the start of a whole...

17:51.853 --> 17:54.160
a "trial separation" period.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.639
What is-- What are we--
What is this?

17:55.639 --> 17:57.206
- What are we doing?
- Oh, no, nothing.

17:57.206 --> 17:58.816
And, uh, then my boss
went and fired me.

17:58.816 --> 18:00.731
Wow, that is "tough."

18:00.731 --> 18:02.255
Yeah, that's not really
how it w-works.

18:02.255 --> 18:03.560
Okay, well, I like it,

18:03.560 --> 18:05.214
and I've been in a box
for 2,000 years,

18:05.214 --> 18:06.911
so I'm just gonna keep that one.

18:06.911 --> 18:08.913
- Sure, okay.
- So, about your

18:08.913 --> 18:11.655
sleazeball "boss," um,

18:11.655 --> 18:13.135
do you want me to kill him?

18:13.135 --> 18:15.529
I'm kind of a sword
and slice gal.

18:15.529 --> 18:18.140
I just get in...
get it done.

18:18.140 --> 18:19.315
Um...

18:19.315 --> 18:20.925
I will go with no.

18:20.925 --> 18:22.362
- Oh.
- I mean, thank you.

18:22.362 --> 18:24.581
Okay, that's too bad
'cause I'm...

18:24.581 --> 18:26.583
It's kind of like my specialty,

18:26.583 --> 18:28.672
- if you know what I mean.
- Sure.

18:28.672 --> 18:30.848
Okay. Hit me with it.
What do you want?

18:30.848 --> 18:33.851
My three big wishes
would be to-to get my child

18:33.851 --> 18:35.940
to love me again,
to get my wife to love me again,

18:35.940 --> 18:37.812
and for us all to be happy.

18:37.812 --> 18:40.597
Oh. Okay, uh,

18:40.597 --> 18:42.904
it doesn't work like that.

18:42.904 --> 18:46.168
Uh, wishes can't change
people's feelings,

18:46.168 --> 18:47.778
but, yeah, that's

18:47.778 --> 18:50.607
just kind of one of
the big rules. It's like a no.

18:50.607 --> 18:54.568
Okay, um... Right.

18:54.568 --> 18:56.178
- We've-- That's a problem.
- Yeah.

18:56.178 --> 18:58.441
Can I just ask, time travel,
can we do that?

18:58.441 --> 19:00.269
'Cause that could solve everything.

19:00.269 --> 19:02.315
Or is that not...

19:02.315 --> 19:04.317
That's a "no can do."

19:04.317 --> 19:06.319
No time travel. That's crucial.

19:06.319 --> 19:08.799
You would just destroy
the history of the world.

19:08.799 --> 19:10.410
I don't know,
maybe we can figure out

19:10.410 --> 19:14.196
some kind of plan
that would "encourage

19:14.196 --> 19:17.199
your wife and child"

19:17.199 --> 19:20.202
to start to feel differently
about you. Right?

19:20.202 --> 19:22.813
Yeah, good. Good.

19:22.813 --> 19:24.293
- You're right.
- Yeah.

19:24.293 --> 19:25.990
- It's time for action.
- O-Oh, great.

19:25.990 --> 19:27.775
- It's time for action.
- Oh.

19:27.775 --> 19:29.864
- I like this.
- I-I wi-- Oh, by the way,

19:29.864 --> 19:31.474
- my name's Bernard.
- Oh, Bernard.

19:31.474 --> 19:33.824
- Yeah, Bernard Bottle.
- Bernard. Oh, Bernard.

19:33.824 --> 19:36.479
Bernard. Bernard Bottle.

19:36.479 --> 19:38.568
Maybe you ever--
You ever just go by "Nardo"?

19:38.568 --> 19:40.004
Uh... uh, I don't

19:40.004 --> 19:42.398
- personally, no.
- No? Okay, think about it.

19:42.398 --> 19:44.792
Uh, Flora Gwendolen Locheed,

19:44.792 --> 19:46.663
uh, Firepit McAllister.

19:46.663 --> 19:49.231
- Oh, beautiful name.
- Yeah. Oh, well, thank you.

19:49.231 --> 19:50.276
So nice to meet you.

19:50.276 --> 19:51.668
It's so nice to meet you, too.

19:51.668 --> 19:53.583
- Yeah. Okay.
- Yes.

19:53.583 --> 19:55.368
- That's good. Thank you.
- Oh, is that good? Okay.

19:55.368 --> 19:57.021
- Oh, got it. And then it stops.
- Thank you. Uh, yeah.

19:57.021 --> 19:58.022
- That's it.
- Got it.

19:58.022 --> 20:00.764
But I-I wish... I wish

20:00.764 --> 20:03.376
we were at my
mother-in-law's house.

20:03.376 --> 20:05.204
I can do that.

20:08.424 --> 20:09.991
- Okay. Yeah, that's--

20:09.991 --> 20:11.471
- It's a bit of a doozy.
-  Yeah.

20:11.471 --> 20:12.689
All right, take a...

20:12.689 --> 20:13.777
- No, I'm good, I'm good.
- Okay, okay.

20:13.777 --> 20:14.865
- I'm good.
- All right.

20:14.865 --> 20:16.432
Oh, there she is.

20:17.955 --> 20:20.828
Okay, okay. What's the plan?
What're we gonna do?

20:22.830 --> 20:25.311
I-I don't know. I'm winging it.
Maybe this was a bad idea.

20:25.311 --> 20:27.530
- May-Maybe.
- Was it?

20:27.530 --> 20:29.793
It's better to have a plan
than not a plan.

20:29.793 --> 20:31.839
Okay, but you know what?
We're here now.

20:31.839 --> 20:33.928
So, let-let's
do something, okay?

20:33.928 --> 20:35.625
- Right?
- Okay.

20:35.625 --> 20:36.844
We're going back to,
you know, back in my day...

20:36.844 --> 20:38.454
- Right.
- ...when a man or a woman

20:38.454 --> 20:39.934
was trying to woo,
you know, someone, suitor,

20:39.934 --> 20:41.805
- whatever you want to call it...
- Sure.

20:43.067 --> 20:44.765
Mating dance.
You want to keep

20:44.765 --> 20:46.810
- this counterclockwise...
- Okay.

20:46.810 --> 20:48.072
...and this clockwise.

20:48.072 --> 20:49.726
Don't ever
sync them up together.

20:49.726 --> 20:51.511
I don't know if I-I can do that.

20:51.511 --> 20:52.816
Is that...?

20:52.816 --> 20:53.991
- Okay.
- Oh, God, no, she saw me.

20:53.991 --> 20:55.602
- She saw me.
- It's good.

20:55.602 --> 20:56.907
- You can talk to her.
- Ah. What am I gonna say?

20:56.907 --> 20:59.388
- Can't we just vanish?

20:59.388 --> 21:00.694
Bernard?

21:00.694 --> 21:02.348
W-What are you doing here?

21:02.348 --> 21:04.306
Hi. Um...

21:04.306 --> 21:06.917
I-- You know what?
I-I-I was just passing through,

21:06.917 --> 21:08.615
and I thought
I'd-I'd just check to see if

21:08.615 --> 21:10.399
- you got here okay.

21:10.399 --> 21:12.923
Who-who is this?

21:12.923 --> 21:15.404
- Flora.
- Um...

21:15.404 --> 21:16.840
This is F-Flora, yes.

21:16.840 --> 21:18.712
- She's-she's a-a friend...
- Yup.

21:18.712 --> 21:20.017
...from work.

21:20.017 --> 21:21.845
Yeah, it's nice
to meet you, ma'am.

21:21.845 --> 21:23.978
Um, you know, we-- Uh...

21:23.978 --> 21:25.893
I do work with Nardo.

21:25.893 --> 21:28.417
You know, we go to
the workplace together,

21:28.417 --> 21:30.550
and we-we do work things in our,

21:30.550 --> 21:32.073
in our work location.

21:32.073 --> 21:33.509
You know what the funny thing--

21:33.509 --> 21:35.598
The reason why
you look so awesome is--

21:35.598 --> 21:38.079
You just went to a Renaissance
fair, didn't you?

21:38.079 --> 21:39.602
Didn't you?

21:39.602 --> 21:40.777
- Didn't I?
- Yeah.

21:40.777 --> 21:42.431
Oh, yeah.

21:42.431 --> 21:45.956
Look, Bernard, I don't know...
what you're up to,

21:45.956 --> 21:48.872
but I-I think
you should go home.

21:48.872 --> 21:51.832
- Too much. Too weird. Get--
- Yeah.

21:51.832 --> 21:53.442
Go sleep it off.

21:53.442 --> 21:54.965
So nice meeting you.

21:54.965 --> 21:57.446
It's-- Uh,
I-I like your sweater.

21:58.926 --> 22:02.538
I think that went well.

22:03.887 --> 22:05.759
I wish we were back at my place.

22:11.112 --> 22:12.635
<i>Think, Nardo.</i>

22:12.635 --> 22:14.637
What is the way
to get to a woman's heart?

22:14.637 --> 22:18.641
Uh, love, kindness, consideration,

22:18.641 --> 22:19.947
offering to do the washing up...

22:19.947 --> 22:21.470
Okay. A-All of that's lovely,

22:21.470 --> 22:23.777
but, also,

22:23.777 --> 22:27.476
a massive sack full of gifts
is really good, too.

22:27.476 --> 22:30.392
Okay. We can crack this.

22:30.392 --> 22:32.742
Uh, are there any markets
near here?

22:32.742 --> 22:35.005
Yeah. I mean, sure, a few.

22:35.005 --> 22:37.051
I mean, this town's
pretty famous for its shopping.

22:37.051 --> 22:38.661
Oh, we're in a town?

22:38.661 --> 22:40.620
Yeah, quite a big one. New York.

22:40.620 --> 22:42.709
Oh, a new town.
Well, la-di-da-di.

22:42.709 --> 22:44.145
But, um, for now,
why don't we get some food?

22:44.145 --> 22:46.060
You must be pretty hungry

22:46.060 --> 22:47.801
after a couple of thousand years
in a small box.

22:47.801 --> 22:49.803
Uh, you can say that again.

22:49.803 --> 22:52.458
Well, uh, uh, I wish we had

22:52.458 --> 22:55.678
a large pizza
from John's on Bleecker,

22:55.678 --> 22:58.551
extra pepperoni, extra cheese.

23:00.553 --> 23:01.945
Ooh!

23:01.945 --> 23:03.077
Hmm.

23:04.078 --> 23:05.122
Ta-da.
Huh.

23:05.122 --> 23:06.950
Hmm.

23:06.950 --> 23:09.039
I mean, I-I don't want
to hurt your feelings, but, um,

23:09.039 --> 23:10.693
it just seems like things

23:10.693 --> 23:12.565
maybe were a little bit better
back in my day.

23:12.565 --> 23:14.871
We would wolf down,
like, a whole fresh deer,

23:14.871 --> 23:16.699
or snatch a salmon
right out of the stream

23:16.699 --> 23:18.222
with our bare hands
and just, ah.

23:18.222 --> 23:19.833
You know, this is, what?

23:19.833 --> 23:21.182
Okay.

23:21.182 --> 23:24.054
This is just a triangle
of red bread.

23:24.054 --> 23:25.795
Well, yeah, I-I mean,
I get what you're saying,

23:25.795 --> 23:27.101
but why don't you just
give it a try?

23:27.101 --> 23:29.016
- Really?
- Yeah, give it a go.

23:32.933 --> 23:34.935
- Mmm.
- Huh?

23:34.935 --> 23:37.503
- Wait a minute.
- Yeah?

23:37.503 --> 23:40.941
Wait an ever-loving minute!

23:42.072 --> 23:43.726
This is heaven.

23:43.726 --> 23:45.815
See? Some new things
are pretty cool.

23:45.815 --> 23:47.774
Uh, uh, this.

23:47.774 --> 23:49.819
- This is gonna blow your mind.
- Okay.

23:49.819 --> 23:51.125
Whoa. Uh,
that's not what I meant.

23:51.125 --> 23:52.039
Eh, that's not
really what it's for.

23:52.039 --> 23:53.040
It's not as good.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.563
Really? Um, no.

23:54.563 --> 23:56.173
Just, uh, pick a song.
Hit something.

23:56.173 --> 23:58.480
That's not what I meant.

23:58.480 --> 23:59.742
Maybe a bit more gentle.

23:59.742 --> 24:01.744
Oh. What is it? Oh, "Spotifee."

24:01.744 --> 24:03.572
We call it Spotify.
Okay, just one.

24:03.572 --> 24:05.008
Gentle, gentle, gentle.

24:05.008 --> 24:06.096
- One line. Yeah.
-  Oh, just one.

24:13.321 --> 24:14.844
Something wrong?

24:14.844 --> 24:17.891
No, something
is incredibly right.

24:17.891 --> 24:21.111
My-my ears were made
to hear this music.

24:21.111 --> 24:24.288
I mean... my wh-- my whole soul

24:24.288 --> 24:25.899
is... [stammers] soaring.

24:25.899 --> 24:27.683
Like a, like a flock
of flamingos.

24:27.683 --> 24:30.904
This new music is incredible.

24:30.904 --> 24:34.516
Yeah, actually, the music
isn't particularly new.

24:34.516 --> 24:35.604
It's actually pretty old.

24:35.604 --> 24:37.214

you get how good this music is.

25:32.313 --> 25:33.880
I mean, back in my day,
it was all, like,

25:33.880 --> 25:35.882
bagpipes and
hollowed out gourds.

25:35.882 --> 25:37.361
Yeah, sure, sure. Maybe we could

25:37.361 --> 25:38.841
continue this conversation
in the other room?

25:38.841 --> 25:41.104
- You got it, Nardo. Great chair.
- Great.

25:41.104 --> 25:44.760
Okay, sure. Do you want to
close... the door?

25:51.071 --> 25:53.856
I mean, wowzers!

25:53.856 --> 25:57.991
This place is big
and tall and-and busy.

25:57.991 --> 26:00.036
- Yeah, it certainly is.
- Whew.

26:00.036 --> 26:02.038
All right. Let's get to work.

26:02.038 --> 26:05.781
Yeah, um, just first,
I just wonder,

26:05.781 --> 26:08.001
maybe, should we, should we
do something about your clothes?

26:08.001 --> 26:09.698
- What?

26:09.698 --> 26:12.092
I mean, I can't get
more stylish than this.

26:12.092 --> 26:13.354
I just thought maybe
you might want to

26:13.354 --> 26:14.703
blend in a little better.

26:14.703 --> 26:16.618
Well, you got to do the thing.

26:16.618 --> 26:18.315
Oh, sorry. [chuckles] Uh, I...

26:18.315 --> 26:21.057
I wish you would
blend in a bit better.

26:21.057 --> 26:23.930
All right. Uh, let's see.

26:25.105 --> 26:26.628
Who do I-- Ooh.

26:26.628 --> 26:27.977
Well, they're killing it.

26:27.977 --> 26:29.979
Uh...

26:29.979 --> 26:32.895
I mean, can you even see me?

26:32.895 --> 26:34.854
This is like, I'm blending.

26:34.854 --> 26:37.334
You know what?
I would, I would keep going.

26:37.334 --> 26:39.380
Uh, okay. All right.

26:39.380 --> 26:41.338
Uh, no, no, no. Oh.

26:41.338 --> 26:43.602
She's perfection.

26:44.690 --> 26:46.213
I mean, this feels right. Right?

26:46.213 --> 26:47.214
Uh...

26:47.214 --> 26:49.216
You know,

26:49.216 --> 26:50.783
m-maybe third time's the charm?

26:50.783 --> 26:54.003
You're very picky, Nardo.
Very picky. Okay.

26:54.003 --> 26:55.701
Uh, let's see. Uh...

26:55.701 --> 26:58.921
How about eeny, meeny,

26:58.921 --> 27:01.010
miny, both.

27:02.142 --> 27:04.927
I mean, now we're talking.
Am I right?

27:04.927 --> 27:06.842
Yeah, uh...

27:06.842 --> 27:08.757
Yeah, I guess that--
It sort of works.

27:08.757 --> 27:11.020
Sort of works? I look fantastic.

27:11.020 --> 27:14.067
Come on. We got to get back
on task. Let's shop.

27:17.331 --> 27:18.724
You know what?
We can start here.

27:18.724 --> 27:19.942
Okay.

27:19.942 --> 27:21.335
- Welcome to Bloomingdale's.
- Oh.

27:21.335 --> 27:22.684
- How you doing today?
- Good.

27:22.684 --> 27:23.946
Enjoy your shopping.

27:23.946 --> 27:25.774
I wish we had
an all-expenses-paid

27:25.774 --> 27:27.167
shopping spree.

27:27.167 --> 27:28.995
Oh. Okay.

27:28.995 --> 27:31.258
Ooh.

27:31.258 --> 27:33.869
Oh, this is amazing.

27:33.869 --> 27:35.958
I've never seen
anything like it.

27:35.958 --> 27:38.134
Oh, wait, look.

27:38.134 --> 27:40.702
What do you call it?

27:40.702 --> 27:43.313
- Oh, sanitizer.
- Sanitizer.

27:43.313 --> 27:45.098
Mmm, it's zesty.

27:45.098 --> 27:47.404
- No, it's...
- Mmm.

27:48.928 --> 27:50.103
- No.
- Oh.

27:50.103 --> 27:51.974
Nardo, look what I found.

27:51.974 --> 27:55.804
Huh? I don't know what it is,
but it's really fun.

27:55.804 --> 27:58.720
I think Julie might love it.
Look, and...

27:58.720 --> 28:01.157
Okay. Sorry. She's new in town.

28:02.332 --> 28:05.118
What is this? That's so pretty.

28:05.118 --> 28:07.424
- It's beautiful.

28:07.424 --> 28:10.863
Your presence is my present.

28:10.863 --> 28:12.429
Get it?

28:12.429 --> 28:14.736
- You need to stop.
Wait, wait.

28:14.736 --> 28:15.737
Oh.

28:15.737 --> 28:18.000
It's hard to run in these.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.002
Pretty good haul, huh?

28:20.002 --> 28:22.004
- You think so?
- Yeah.

28:22.004 --> 28:24.485
I think Julie and Eve
are gonna be pretty excited.

28:24.485 --> 28:26.356
Well, I hope they are.

28:26.356 --> 28:29.142
- Oh, my God.
- What? What?

28:29.142 --> 28:31.361
I had just hoped that
by now that this

28:31.361 --> 28:33.450
kind of torture had stopped.

28:33.450 --> 28:35.365
This is a gym.

28:35.365 --> 28:37.150
They-they actually pay
to do these things.

28:37.150 --> 28:39.369
Yeah. Okay, good one.

28:39.369 --> 28:41.937
I will avenge thee!

28:41.937 --> 28:44.113
Okay, you need
to stop that. Sorry.

28:44.113 --> 28:45.985
I will avenge thee!

28:45.985 --> 28:47.551
- Sorry.

28:47.551 --> 28:49.815
And what would you like
for Christmas this year?

28:49.815 --> 28:51.207
Hey, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

28:51.207 --> 28:52.382
Why-why are all these people
standing in line

28:52.382 --> 28:54.080
to see Mr. Beardie?

28:54.080 --> 28:56.082
Ooh, is he like the king
or an emperor or something?

28:56.082 --> 28:57.518
Uh, no, it's actually,

28:57.518 --> 28:58.998
it's just
the whole Christmas thing.

28:58.998 --> 29:00.390
Basically,
the guy with the beard,

29:00.390 --> 29:02.218
he flies around with
a bunch of reindeer.

29:02.218 --> 29:04.177
- Okay.
- Uh, he goes down the chimney

29:04.177 --> 29:06.832
and puts these presents
in these huge stockings that

29:06.832 --> 29:08.268
kids hang along the fireplace.

29:08.268 --> 29:10.313
Kind of amazing
'cause you had a hard time

29:10.313 --> 29:13.229
believing in genies,
but, uh, okay.

29:13.229 --> 29:16.058
I want a car
and a rocket launcher.

29:16.058 --> 29:19.061
Here is your pencil.

29:19.061 --> 29:22.325
Christmas is also the time kids
learn all about disappointment.

29:22.325 --> 29:24.284
Yeah, m... Ugh.

29:24.284 --> 29:26.025
- Here you go, sir.
- Oh, thank you.

29:26.025 --> 29:27.287
Enjoy.

29:30.116 --> 29:31.465
Excuse me, Bernard.

29:31.465 --> 29:35.077
You, sir, are an artist.

29:35.077 --> 29:37.819
- Thank you.
- Wow.

29:37.819 --> 29:40.604
-  Thanks. All right.
- Wow, wow, wow.

29:40.604 --> 29:44.217
Okay, so tell me about this
whole Christmas thing of yours.

29:44.217 --> 29:48.221
Oh. Uh, well, it-it's
become really commercial,

29:48.221 --> 29:50.397
but... originally,
it was meant to celebrate

29:50.397 --> 29:53.139
the birth of this guy. He was,
he was called Jesus Christ.

29:53.139 --> 29:56.229
Wait, what? Jesus? Are you
talking about Mary's kid?

29:56.229 --> 29:57.839
Yeah.

29:57.839 --> 29:59.362
What? I knew him.

29:59.362 --> 30:01.408
What did he do to get so famous?

30:01.408 --> 30:03.845
You... [chuckles] Wow. Okay, uh,

30:03.845 --> 30:05.368
well, he turned out to be
the Son of God.

30:05.368 --> 30:08.415
Oh, no,
I thought he was kidding.

30:08.415 --> 30:10.591
Wait, what?
You-you actually met him?

30:10.591 --> 30:13.159
Yeah. Oh, my-- yeah, last time
I was out of the box.

30:13.159 --> 30:15.465
This is amazing, like...

30:15.465 --> 30:17.163
What? I mean,

30:17.163 --> 30:19.121
okay, what was,
what was he like?

30:19.121 --> 30:20.906
What was Jesus like?

30:20.906 --> 30:23.038
You know, he's Jesus.
He's just kind of like, "Hey."

30:23.038 --> 30:26.172
But financially under-ambitious,

30:26.172 --> 30:28.304
to tell you the truth.
I mean, I did say to him once,

30:28.304 --> 30:30.306
I'm like, "With your talents,

30:30.306 --> 30:32.569
"I mean water,
kaboom, into wine,

30:32.569 --> 30:35.311
conjuring fish out of thin air."

30:35.311 --> 30:37.487
I said, "Big J, we should open
a restaurant together."

30:37.487 --> 30:39.098
You know, we could call it,
like, "Something Fishy"

30:39.098 --> 30:40.664
or "Oh, My Cod."

Uh, no, that's actually,

32:03.399 --> 32:06.141
Wait, do you want
to see a movie? -Yes.

32:06.141 --> 32:07.708
I have no idea
what a movie is, but, uh,

32:07.708 --> 32:10.232
I would really like
to see one, I think.

32:14.628 --> 32:16.717

- Tom Cruise.

32:36.215 --> 32:38.260
- Yeah.
- I mean, he's huge.

32:38.260 --> 32:40.393
He's the biggest human being
I've ever seen.

32:40.393 --> 32:42.525
Where-where do giants
like Tom Cruise live?

32:42.525 --> 32:45.180
- Uh, in Los Angeles mainly.
- Los Angeles mainly.

32:45.180 --> 32:47.617
I mean, I'm never going there,
because I think

32:47.617 --> 32:49.489
he would take that enormous foot

32:49.489 --> 32:51.491
and just crunch me with it.

32:51.491 --> 32:54.059
Or, I don't know,
maybe I should go because

32:54.059 --> 32:57.149
what if he uses those enormous
juicy lips to kiss me?

32:57.149 --> 32:59.194
I really wouldn't worry
about it. I mean, Tom,

32:59.194 --> 33:00.674
Tom Cruise is definitely
just normal size.

33:00.674 --> 33:03.372
Like, in fact,
everything's normal sized.

33:03.372 --> 33:05.374
It's just the movies
that make them look big.

33:05.374 --> 33:08.290
- Ah.

33:08.290 --> 33:09.726
That's fine.

33:09.726 --> 33:12.033
Ho, ho. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hi.

33:12.033 --> 33:14.209
Hi. I don't think
we've been introduced.

33:14.209 --> 33:16.472
- I'm Lenny.
- Oh.

33:16.472 --> 33:18.083

33:18.083 --> 33:21.086

I mean, I-I love this.

I love a man in a uniform.

Thank you.

33:25.307 --> 33:26.526
- Uh, she's my...
I-I got it.

33:26.526 --> 33:28.310
An old friend. You know,

33:28.310 --> 33:29.746
just in from out of town.

33:29.746 --> 33:31.792
Spending a few days just to help

33:31.792 --> 33:34.360
this one get out of the pickle
he got himself into with Julie.

33:34.360 --> 33:36.405
Good, I'm glad
someone's doing that,

33:36.405 --> 33:38.494
and I think it's working.
I haven't seen him glowing

33:38.494 --> 33:40.409
like this in a, in a bit.

33:40.409 --> 33:42.498
Well... -You know, I try
my best, but I don't think,

33:42.498 --> 33:44.457
uh, I don't-- I rarely glow.

33:44.457 --> 33:46.676
I think I-- I'm a little
rough, little rough. -Oh.

33:46.676 --> 33:49.070
I mean, I-I like things
rough around the edges.

33:50.593 --> 33:52.204
- Do you?
- If you know what I mean?

33:52.204 --> 33:53.640
- You old green eyes--
- Mm-hmm.

33:53.640 --> 33:55.207
- Oh, hazel.
- Hazel is right.

33:55.207 --> 33:56.773
And you get what I'm saying?

33:56.773 --> 33:58.558
Yeah, I think everyone gets
what you're saying, so...

33:58.558 --> 34:01.169
- What's that?

34:01.169 --> 34:03.171
Uh, uh, yeah.

34:03.171 --> 34:04.781
I think he
has to go to the bathroom.

34:04.781 --> 34:06.740
Uh... -LENNY: You have a key.
Don't you have a key?

34:06.740 --> 34:08.350
I don't need to go. -FLORA: Do
you have to go to the bathroom?

34:08.350 --> 34:09.743
Yeah, I do have--
Good seeing you, Lenny. Bye.

34:09.743 --> 34:11.527
Okay, Bernie. Flora?
Di-- Do-- Have we met?

34:11.527 --> 34:13.181
Like, back in the day?
Did we...?

34:13.181 --> 34:15.618
It would've been
way back in the day.

34:15.618 --> 34:18.360
- Way, way back.
- Key West. Key West?

34:18.360 --> 34:20.101
Maybe.

34:23.931 --> 34:25.759
We should go.

34:25.759 --> 34:27.761
I'm almost ready.

34:27.761 --> 34:29.850
Okay.

34:32.853 --> 34:35.073

How'd you want to get there?

34:45.779 --> 34:48.216
Do you want one
of those car things? -Yeah.

34:48.216 --> 34:49.478
Okay, what kind?

34:49.478 --> 34:51.567
Just something subtle,

34:51.567 --> 34:53.482
sensible.

34:58.966 --> 35:01.142
Do you think we've got
enough presents?

35:01.142 --> 35:03.275
I-I think we would have had
to have gotten

35:03.275 --> 35:04.798
a second car to get any more.

35:04.798 --> 35:06.452
Right, right?
What about this little guy?

35:06.452 --> 35:08.541
All right, let's see what
this thing can do.

35:08.541 --> 35:10.238
Okay. Okay, you ready?

35:59.896 --> 36:02.377
It's not easy for either of us.

36:02.377 --> 36:04.379
Um...

36:04.379 --> 36:06.207
Dad, do you want
to get ice cream?

to have cherry, do you?

36:26.923 --> 36:29.665

having them next door.

36:58.781 --> 37:01.349

Yeah.

37:13.448 --> 37:15.363
Can we do the stuff in the car
another time?

fifth-wheeling my own family?

38:08.721 --> 38:10.462
This is a disaster.

38:10.462 --> 38:13.073
Here's a question-- and
there's no wrong answer-- but...

would you maybe feel better
if you would wish,

- Good to see you. -Okay.

39:50.953 --> 39:51.954
Hi, Mum.

39:51.954 --> 39:53.652
The caterer?

39:53.652 --> 39:55.654
- You have a caterer?
- Well, I just thought I'd...

39:55.654 --> 39:58.134
- Starving, so this works out.
- Hey.

40:00.006 --> 40:02.965
How did you forget that your
entire family was coming over?

40:02.965 --> 40:04.880
Yeah, I mean, there's-there's
been a lot of distractions

40:04.880 --> 40:06.795
- in the last couple days.
- That's fair.

40:06.795 --> 40:08.449
Okay, what do you need me to do?

40:08.449 --> 40:10.582
Uh, okay, I wish
there was a complete meal

40:10.582 --> 40:13.541
with all the trimmings
right here in this kitchen.

40:16.588 --> 40:18.111
- That's pretty good!
- Yeah? Okay.

40:18.111 --> 40:19.504
This is gonna be so fun.

40:19.504 --> 40:21.636
I bet your family's great.

40:21.636 --> 40:24.204
And then Paul looks directly
at me and says,

40:24.204 --> 40:26.598
"David,
I actually am an accountant."

40:28.034 --> 40:29.470
Imagine, we had quite a laugh
about that.

40:31.080 --> 40:32.081
Why?

40:33.909 --> 40:35.998
I'm still a little confused.

40:35.998 --> 40:38.479
Where are Eve and Julie?

40:38.479 --> 40:40.612
Great question.
- Yeah. [chuckles] Right. Um...

40:40.612 --> 40:42.744
We're-we're actually on a...

40:42.744 --> 40:44.485
bit of a break at the moment.

40:44.485 --> 40:46.269
-A break. What-what
does that mean, a break?

40:46.269 --> 40:48.054
- Well, l-let me explain.
Bernie,

40:48.054 --> 40:50.186
you've got to work
on a marriage. -I know.

40:50.186 --> 40:51.579
Yeah, you can say that again.

40:51.579 --> 40:52.972
Excuse me.

40:52.972 --> 40:54.713
See? See, this is why
I never took the plunge.

40:54.713 --> 40:56.889
You know? Some stallions,
they just need to roam free.

40:56.889 --> 40:59.674
Bernard, hey, look, man,
if you ever want to talk,

40:59.674 --> 41:00.936
<i>mano y mano,</i>

41:00.936 --> 41:02.590
I'm here for you, bud.

41:02.590 --> 41:04.070
Yeah, you're not using
that correctly.

41:04.070 --> 41:05.550
Actually, I'm pretty sure I am.

41:05.550 --> 41:07.073
'Cause it's man friend
to man friend.

41:07.073 --> 41:08.553
Who's ready for dead bird?

41:08.553 --> 41:10.163
Huh?

41:11.556 --> 41:12.818
That is a strange bunch.

41:12.818 --> 41:14.602
I mean, you're telling me?

41:16.082 --> 41:17.605
I-I j-- I just wish
I could find a way

41:17.605 --> 41:18.780
to make them happy, you know?

41:19.999 --> 41:21.217
Wait a minute.

41:22.218 --> 41:24.960
Okay. I have a fantastic plan.

41:24.960 --> 41:26.788
Risky...

41:26.788 --> 41:28.964
but I think fantastic.

41:28.964 --> 41:30.618
All right, guys,
just l-listen up.

41:30.618 --> 41:32.054
I've-I've got something
I'd-I'd love to tell you.

41:32.054 --> 41:33.055
It's about me and Flora.

41:33.055 --> 41:34.187
Mm. See? Told you.

41:34.187 --> 41:35.188
He's already got
a new girlfriend.

41:35.188 --> 41:36.276
No, it's-- it is--

41:36.276 --> 41:37.190
it's nothing to do with that.

41:37.190 --> 41:38.539
It's-it's-it's...

41:38.539 --> 41:40.541
Uh, um...

41:40.541 --> 41:41.542
How do I say this?

41:41.542 --> 41:42.630
Um, Flora, she's a genie.

41:42.630 --> 41:44.893
- A what?

41:44.893 --> 41:46.634
Don't laugh.
-  -What?

41:46.634 --> 41:47.809
What? What? -BERNARD:
She can make wishes come true.

41:47.809 --> 41:49.332
- Yeah.
- As you all know,

41:49.332 --> 41:51.117
it's only three wishes.
Absolutely only three,

41:51.117 --> 41:53.075
- but, yeah, that's, uh...
- Yeah. Three.

41:53.075 --> 41:54.555
- Yeah.
- That's my Christmas gift to...

41:54.555 --> 41:56.078
each one of you. Three wishes.

41:56.078 --> 41:57.993
Pretty good gift, right?

41:57.993 --> 41:59.734
Okay,

41:59.734 --> 42:01.562
okay, he's lost his mind.
Julie's left him... -What?

42:01.562 --> 42:03.303
...and he's lost his mind.
I mean,

42:03.303 --> 42:04.870
you all thought I was the one
who was gonna go off the rails.

42:04.870 --> 42:07.046
But, no, perfect Bernard...

42:07.046 --> 42:08.917
Don't do that. Okay, it's true.

42:08.917 --> 42:10.832
For example,
Mar-Marvin, you just...

42:10.832 --> 42:12.660
you just had to wear
that Harvard sweatshirt,

42:12.660 --> 42:14.836
again, even though
we all know Diana hates it.

42:14.836 --> 42:17.143
Because he didn't go
to Harvard. -

42:17.143 --> 42:19.014
- Why wear it? -
I wish

42:19.014 --> 42:22.061
Marvin was wearing something
Diana actually liked.

42:25.325 --> 42:27.936
And I wish Dad could be
more like the man

42:27.936 --> 42:28.937
Mum fell in love with.

42:31.070 --> 42:32.680
Oh.
-  Whoa.

42:32.680 --> 42:34.029
Oh, my God.
And...

42:34.029 --> 42:35.727
I wish Pete would stop referring
to himself

42:35.727 --> 42:37.816
as a "lone wolf" and just
sign up for all the dating apps.

42:43.648 --> 42:44.866
There you go.

42:44.866 --> 42:45.998
There's my three.

42:45.998 --> 42:47.216
Proof is in the genie pudding.

42:47.216 --> 42:48.609
Am I right?

42:48.609 --> 42:51.133
I wish
I had my old husband back.

42:53.048 --> 42:54.397
Oh, God.

42:54.397 --> 42:56.878
I actually have
three big ones planned.

42:56.878 --> 42:59.315
First, I wish
for my own whole set

42:59.315 --> 43:02.362
of Honma titanium golf clubs.

43:02.362 --> 43:04.233
- Oh!

43:04.233 --> 43:06.279
You don't--
you don't even really like golf.

43:06.279 --> 43:08.281
You just like wearing
your weird wicking fabric shirts

43:08.281 --> 43:09.848
and drinking in the clubhouse.

43:09.848 --> 43:11.980
Baby, I wish
you would stop talking

43:11.980 --> 43:13.939
and just let me get on
with this.

43:13.939 --> 43:16.071
Uh, uh...

43:18.857 --> 43:21.163
Does that mean Diana's never
gonna be able to talk again?

43:21.163 --> 43:22.687
Unless Marvin
was to wish for her

43:22.687 --> 43:24.166
not to be able
to not talk anymore.

43:24.166 --> 43:25.733
Oh, come on.

43:25.733 --> 43:27.082
Dude!

43:27.082 --> 43:28.388
Uh...

43:28.388 --> 43:30.042
Okay.

43:30.042 --> 43:32.261
Yeah, whatever.
I, like, wish that...

43:32.261 --> 43:33.915
Diana could talk again.

43:35.090 --> 43:36.701
- Huh.

43:36.701 --> 43:39.660
Well, thanks, babe.

43:39.660 --> 43:41.793
Marvin, I wish
you would just go to hell.

43:42.837 --> 43:44.447
- Oh...

43:44.447 --> 43:46.275
Okay, please stop!

43:46.275 --> 43:49.670
Is anybody gonna wish
Marvin back from hell?

43:50.497 --> 43:52.020
Damn it.

43:52.020 --> 43:53.152
Fine.

43:53.152 --> 43:54.762
I guess...

43:54.762 --> 43:57.025
I guess I wish
he'd come back from hell.

43:59.201 --> 44:00.768
Oh, my God!

44:00.768 --> 44:02.378
What was it like?

44:02.378 --> 44:04.380
Uh, I think it's pretty obvious.

44:04.380 --> 44:06.034
Very hot down there.

44:06.034 --> 44:07.775
Mm. -And how does
the devil look like?

44:07.775 --> 44:09.385
W-Well, he kind of looked like
Ricky Gervais.

44:09.385 --> 44:10.691
All right, stop.

44:10.691 --> 44:12.954
You're a family.
You're my family.

44:12.954 --> 44:16.175
This is our one real chance
for happiness.

44:16.175 --> 44:17.176
Please,

44:17.176 --> 44:19.221
just... focus.

44:19.221 --> 44:20.745
- Yeah.
Actually,

44:20.745 --> 44:22.094
Bernard,

44:22.094 --> 44:24.052
I just wish
this whole thing was over.

44:25.314 --> 44:26.707
Done.

44:30.145 --> 44:31.407
Oh.

44:31.407 --> 44:33.801
Oh, wowzers.

44:34.889 --> 44:36.325
I mean, in all my years,

44:36.325 --> 44:39.764
I have never seen
anyone use the wishes worse.

44:39.764 --> 44:41.113
Yeah.

44:44.725 --> 44:47.162
I mean,
we've got to be so careful.

44:47.162 --> 44:49.164
All my family could
literally have gone to hell.

44:49.164 --> 44:50.426
One of 'em did.

44:50.426 --> 44:51.689
Yeah.

44:52.515 --> 44:55.475
Okay. It's WWTCD time.

44:55.475 --> 44:56.519
What's that?

44:56.519 --> 44:58.913
"What would Tom Cruise do?"

44:58.913 --> 45:01.002
-  Because Operation

45:01.002 --> 45:04.876
Bring Julie and Eve Back Home
is not <i>Mission: Impossible.</i>

45:04.876 --> 45:05.877
What is it?

45:05.877 --> 45:07.313
What?

45:07.313 --> 45:08.923
It's Wishing: Impossible.

45:10.359 --> 45:12.840
You know, I think
we should start with, like,

45:12.840 --> 45:15.147
kind of sprucing up the place
for Julie.

45:15.147 --> 45:16.931
You know?
Which means probably getting...

45:16.931 --> 45:20.500
rid of quite a few of
these old, dusty Nardo trinkets.

45:20.500 --> 45:22.894
This is our first fix.

45:25.418 --> 45:26.854
You know what? You're right.

45:26.854 --> 45:28.160
She actually always hated
this thing.

45:28.160 --> 45:29.857
- Yeah.
- Yeah. I can't imagine why.

45:29.857 --> 45:31.293
Is it your shirt?

45:31.293 --> 45:32.991
Uh, no, it's not mine.

45:32.991 --> 45:35.036
It's actually--
He was a famous footballer.

45:35.036 --> 45:37.386
Do you have his underpants
or trousers?

45:37.386 --> 45:39.040
- It's not a crazy question.

45:39.040 --> 45:40.302
Yeah, no,
I don't have his pants.

45:40.302 --> 45:42.217
So does anybody else have
your shirt

45:42.217 --> 45:46.004
or maybe, maybe your underpants
under glass in their house?

45:46.004 --> 45:47.135
Well, not yet, but...

45:47.135 --> 45:48.876
Okay. All right.

45:48.876 --> 45:50.182
Think we should swap it
for something

45:50.182 --> 45:52.358
maybe, maybe
that Julie would enjoy.

45:52.358 --> 45:53.402
What?

45:53.402 --> 45:55.491
Let's swap it for something

45:55.491 --> 45:57.929
- deeply respectful. You know?
- Oh, okay. All right.

45:57.929 --> 46:00.453
Um...
Go on. Make it the <i>Mona Lisa.</i>

46:03.456 --> 46:06.154
I mean,
she could have smiled, right?

46:06.154 --> 46:08.853
N-No, no, no. That's really--
that's very much the point.

46:08.853 --> 46:09.854
Ah.

46:09.854 --> 46:11.203
Okay. Well, I don't know.

46:11.203 --> 46:12.944
I think
we're off to a good start.

46:14.075 --> 46:15.207
All right.

46:15.207 --> 46:18.906
That's what I'm talking about.

46:18.906 --> 46:20.125
- Well done!
- Oh, thank you.

46:20.125 --> 46:21.561
I mean, look at this, right?

46:21.561 --> 46:23.345
I think Julie's gonna love it.

46:23.345 --> 46:26.087
But you see? Everything's
gonna be perfect again.

46:26.087 --> 46:29.917
And you're gonna be back
with Julie and Eve, and I'm...

46:29.917 --> 46:32.398
you know, I'm-I'm g--
I'm gonna be...

46:32.398 --> 46:33.921
- What?

46:33.921 --> 46:35.618
Uh, nothing. You know?

46:35.618 --> 46:37.011
I'll-I'll be around.

46:37.011 --> 46:38.883
You know? Doing my thang.

46:38.883 --> 46:42.103
-Which, of course,
is doing your thang...

46:42.103 --> 46:43.409
for you.

46:44.976 --> 46:46.499
Which is great.

46:47.674 --> 46:50.895
Okay, put a-- put a fork in me,
I'm done.

46:50.895 --> 46:52.592
Uh, that's-- I don't want you
to put a fork in me.

46:52.592 --> 46:54.028
- I'm just tired.
- Okay.

46:54.028 --> 46:56.552
Okay. All right, good night.

46:56.552 --> 46:58.859
- Night. Night, Flora.
- Uh-huh.

48:15.980 --> 48:17.329
<i>Mon Dieu.</i>

48:17.329 --> 48:19.200
<i>- Mon Dieu.</i>

48:31.604 --> 48:32.648
Hey, Dad.

48:32.648 --> 48:35.738
Hey, child.

48:35.738 --> 48:38.219
Child's mother.
Exactly on time.

48:38.219 --> 48:41.657
Punctuality. Very important
for relationships.

48:41.657 --> 48:43.572
Right. I know that, now.

48:44.617 --> 48:45.705
I'll see you tomorrow, baby.

48:47.054 --> 48:48.055
Have fun.

48:48.055 --> 48:49.970
Um, you'll bring her back?

48:49.970 --> 48:51.363
Yeah, of course.
I'll see you then.

48:51.363 --> 48:54.018
- All right. Bye.
- Bye.

48:57.064 --> 48:59.371
I've got someone
I want you to meet.

49:01.112 --> 49:02.548
Hi, Eve.

49:02.548 --> 49:04.332
So, this is, um, Miss Flora.

49:04.332 --> 49:06.247
She's gonna be
staying with us for a bit.

49:06.247 --> 49:08.641
And if you need anything,
just-just let me know,

49:08.641 --> 49:11.731
because, you know,
your wish is my command.

49:11.731 --> 49:13.254
Indirectly.

49:13.254 --> 49:15.126
- Okay. Young lady?
- Yep.

49:15.126 --> 49:16.997
I think I might have
a couple of things

49:16.997 --> 49:18.259
that might meet
with your approval.

49:19.521 --> 49:20.696
Why don't you have a look
in your bedroom?

49:20.696 --> 49:22.220
Is it a dollhouse?

49:22.220 --> 49:24.091
It's definitely a dollhouse!

49:26.093 --> 49:27.573
Why?

49:27.573 --> 49:29.792
- Why are you--
- I'm sorry. I got very excited.

49:31.533 --> 49:33.057
- Yeah?

49:33.057 --> 49:35.189
Yes!
Yes, you like it?

49:35.189 --> 49:38.018
-  I love it!
- Go on. Go on and look.

49:38.018 --> 49:40.064
Look at that.
It's good.

49:40.064 --> 49:42.327
Let's go to the bath.

49:42.327 --> 49:43.763
Okay.

49:43.763 --> 49:48.028
The trick is to be
as precise as possible.

49:48.028 --> 49:49.421
- You see?
- Wow.

49:49.421 --> 49:51.379
♪ Merry Christmas, baby...

49:51.379 --> 49:54.295
The dollhouse is awesome.
Thanks, Dad.

49:55.296 --> 49:56.645
Are you happy?

49:56.645 --> 49:58.604
Yeah.

50:01.128 --> 50:03.304
Oh, uh, Eve, Eve.

50:03.304 --> 50:06.046
I'd love to see it if you want
to show me around a bit more?

50:06.046 --> 50:07.482
I'd love that.

50:07.482 --> 50:09.484
Let's do it. Okay?

50:09.484 --> 50:10.790
All right.
You've got this, right?

50:10.790 --> 50:13.445
Yeah. I got it.
Precision?

50:13.445 --> 50:16.230
♪ You surely treat me nice

50:20.800 --> 50:23.237
- Oh.

50:23.237 --> 50:27.198
♪ Love you, baby,
the rest of my life ♪

50:29.591 --> 50:31.680
♪ Merry Christmas, baby...

50:31.680 --> 50:33.073
So, a running race?

50:33.073 --> 50:34.509
Yep.

50:34.509 --> 50:38.078
- Like an actual running race?
- Yes, you run.

50:38.078 --> 50:39.514
It's just, I'm so obviously
gonna beat you.

50:39.514 --> 50:41.255
I'm a fully grown man
with long legs

50:41.255 --> 50:43.344
and you're a small girl
in old-fashioned shoes.

50:43.344 --> 50:44.650
Yeah.

50:44.650 --> 50:46.652
- Race you to the big tree!
- Hey!

50:46.652 --> 50:48.871
Hey, that's cheating!

50:48.871 --> 50:51.352
Being clever is not cheating!

50:52.353 --> 50:53.528
Uh...

50:53.528 --> 50:56.749
do you use it for something?

50:56.749 --> 50:58.403
Yes.

50:58.403 --> 51:00.318
Does it breathe?

51:05.584 --> 51:07.586
I'm reading this book about,

51:07.586 --> 51:11.285
about parallel universes
and time travel

51:11.285 --> 51:13.200
- and dimensional portals.
- Yes.

51:13.200 --> 51:14.549
- Right? You know about th--
- Yeah.

51:14.549 --> 51:15.681
- Have you heard about it?
- I-- Well, yes.

51:15.681 --> 51:17.596
Uh, there's a high likelihood

51:17.596 --> 51:21.339
that there's another version
of me that might be a,

51:21.339 --> 51:23.341
like an equestrian trainer or,
or a chef.

51:23.341 --> 51:25.343
Hmm, I would say it's--

51:25.343 --> 51:27.432
You're definitely
somewhere else on a horse.

51:27.432 --> 51:29.260
- Hmm? Okay.

51:31.131 --> 51:32.132
Ah.

51:32.132 --> 51:34.134
Here comes trouble.

51:34.134 --> 51:36.441
Hey, Flora. Hey, Lenny.

51:36.441 --> 51:38.138
Hey, nice to have you back, kiddo.

51:38.138 --> 51:39.661
Your dad's kind of boring
on his own.

51:39.661 --> 51:41.359
No way.

51:41.359 --> 51:43.404
He used to be a selfish bastard,
but now he's great.

51:43.404 --> 51:46.538
- Oh...
- Oh. Wow.

51:46.538 --> 51:48.409
- Bye, Lenny.
- Bye.

52:08.690 --> 52:10.170
- Here she is, in one piece.

52:10.170 --> 52:11.824
- Hi, Grandma.
- Hey, sweetheart.

52:11.824 --> 52:13.608
- Hey.

52:13.608 --> 52:14.957
Did you have a good time?

52:14.957 --> 52:17.873
- Really great.
- Oh, good.

52:17.873 --> 52:20.398
Thanks, Bernie.
That's wonderful.

52:34.325 --> 52:35.804
Hello?

52:35.804 --> 52:38.764
-  It's Julie.
- What?

52:40.679 --> 52:42.376
- Let me hear.
- No, no, no, no.

52:42.376 --> 52:44.770
No, that, that,
that would be great. Um...

52:44.770 --> 52:47.773
Oh, Friday night here, 7:00?

52:47.773 --> 52:49.514
No, that's-that's,
um, that's perfect.

52:49.514 --> 52:51.777
Just the three of us?

52:51.777 --> 52:54.910
Yeah, that's,
that's, that's great.

52:54.910 --> 52:57.304
Okay, um, yeah,
I'll see you then.

52:57.304 --> 52:59.437
Okay, bye.

52:59.437 --> 53:00.916
What just happened?

53:00.916 --> 53:03.745
Yeah, she, uh, she wants
to come over Friday night.

53:03.745 --> 53:05.399
You are back in business.

53:05.399 --> 53:06.879
Right?
You are back in what?

53:06.879 --> 53:08.620
- Business.
- That's right.

53:08.620 --> 53:10.796
Okay. Do me a favor.

53:10.796 --> 53:11.971
Let me handle dinner,

53:11.971 --> 53:14.452
'cause romance is
kind of my thing.

53:14.452 --> 53:16.497
- Romance is your thing?
- Yeah.

53:16.497 --> 53:17.977
Okay, well,
I-I wish you would do that.

53:17.977 --> 53:20.327
- Okay.
- Thank you, my friend.

53:20.327 --> 53:21.981
Okay, this is it.

53:21.981 --> 53:23.417
We are gonna do this, all right?

53:23.417 --> 53:25.463
We are in it, and Julie's about

53:25.463 --> 53:28.988
to find herself on the road
to Ro-Nardomance.

53:30.729 --> 53:33.862

-  Go.

53:48.964 --> 53:51.924
All she's been talking about
is that dollhouse.

53:51.924 --> 53:53.012
Yeah, I bet.

53:53.012 --> 53:55.536
Wow.

53:55.536 --> 53:57.451
You weren't kidding...

53:57.451 --> 53:59.453
when you said
you spruced up the place.

53:59.453 --> 54:03.414
Yeah, well, I know you always
wanted a bit of a refresh.

54:03.414 --> 54:06.417
- So...
- Oh, my God.

54:06.417 --> 54:09.594
- Oh, so this is the dollhouse.
Do you like it?

54:09.594 --> 54:10.899
Okay, well...

54:12.379 --> 54:14.251
It's amazing.

54:15.339 --> 54:16.862
Okay.
Wow.

54:16.862 --> 54:18.907
That was really delicious.

how to make martinis?

54:27.916 --> 54:30.049
- Ah, cheers to you.
- Cheers.

54:32.443 --> 54:33.792
Oh, my God.

54:33.792 --> 54:36.316
Look at that.

54:36.316 --> 54:37.491
Fireworks.

54:37.491 --> 54:39.841
How lucky are we?

54:47.762 --> 54:49.634
Wow.

54:49.634 --> 54:51.549
Look at that.

54:51.549 --> 54:55.466

55:14.093 --> 55:16.748
Uh, yeah.

55:17.749 --> 55:19.359
Look, Bernie, I...

55:19.359 --> 55:21.883
I know that this has been a...

55:21.883 --> 55:25.452
really tough time
and I just, um...

55:25.452 --> 55:28.586
And I know that it's only been
a couple weeks,

55:28.586 --> 55:31.719
but I-I think it might be
worth thinking

55:31.719 --> 55:36.681
about how this all
might work long-term.

55:37.986 --> 55:39.379
Long-term?

55:39.379 --> 55:40.859
Look, I don't mean forever.

55:40.859 --> 55:42.426
Look, I don't,

55:42.426 --> 55:43.601
I don't know
what's gonna happen,

55:43.601 --> 55:45.472
I just--

55:45.472 --> 55:48.388
Like, longer-term.
Like now.

55:48.388 --> 55:50.129
You know, f-for instance,

55:50.129 --> 55:53.001
I was thinking that maybe
you could take Eve

55:53.001 --> 55:55.526
on the 23rd and the 24th?

55:56.831 --> 56:00.661
Uh, uh, you mean,
a-actual Christmas Eve.

56:00.661 --> 56:01.923
Yeah.

56:01.923 --> 56:05.971
Yeah, it... seems
as though magically, um,

56:05.971 --> 56:09.801
us taking time apart
has been the making of you two.

56:09.801 --> 56:12.673
I mean, that's good news.

56:12.673 --> 56:15.589
Though, sort of cloaked in bad.

56:16.634 --> 56:19.027
Bernard, you're a good man.

56:21.203 --> 56:22.509
Thank you for dinner.

56:30.604 --> 56:31.997
Bye, Dad.

56:33.085 --> 56:34.739
See you tomorrow, darling.

56:40.919 --> 56:42.442
Sorry.

56:42.442 --> 56:46.011
- I'm sorry, that was tough.
- Yeah, I know.

56:46.011 --> 56:49.101
But the Eve news,
that's great, so...

56:49.101 --> 56:50.624
You know, I really thought

56:50.624 --> 56:52.104
the fireworks
were gonna work better.

56:52.104 --> 56:54.889
Yeah, the fireworks
were pretty epic actually.

56:54.889 --> 56:56.978
I mean, I-I thought
you had some other stuff?

56:56.978 --> 57:00.025
Yeah, I did, but then Julie
kind of left

57:00.025 --> 57:02.027
before I hit my stride.

57:03.028 --> 57:04.856
Ta-da!

57:04.856 --> 57:07.554
I mean, not too shabby, right?

57:08.599 --> 57:09.730
Is that a bear?

57:09.730 --> 57:11.906
It used to be.

57:11.906 --> 57:14.082
And a fire?
We don't have a chimney.

57:14.082 --> 57:15.475
I'm a genie.

57:15.475 --> 57:16.520
Right.

57:16.520 --> 57:17.608
Ooh, I should let the band go.

57:17.608 --> 57:19.087
The band?

57:19.087 --> 57:20.959
- Hey, guys, I--
Okay, here we go.

57:20.959 --> 57:23.004
One, two, three, four.

57:35.756 --> 57:37.758
What?

57:37.758 --> 57:39.760
- What?
-  It's Julie.

57:39.760 --> 57:40.761
No.

57:40.761 --> 57:42.676
It's Julie.

57:42.676 --> 57:44.112
She went all the way downstairs

57:44.112 --> 57:46.027
and she started thinking
about your Nardoness,

57:46.027 --> 57:49.814
then she came all the way back
upstairs for-for this.

57:49.814 --> 57:51.076
- Let's just...
- Do you think? Look--

57:51.076 --> 57:52.512
- Ow! Don't do that.
- Yeah. Okay.

57:52.512 --> 57:54.035
It's just good energy for ya.

57:54.035 --> 57:55.036
- Okay.
- Yeah?

57:55.036 --> 57:56.516
Oh, I should not be here.

57:56.516 --> 57:57.952
- Okay, you know what?
- You, you--

57:57.952 --> 57:59.519
I've got a date
with Tom Cruise tonight, so.

57:59.519 --> 58:00.999
Okay, good.
Um, well, hey,

58:00.999 --> 58:03.044
I wi-- I wish you were
at that cinema.

58:03.044 --> 58:04.872

58:28.809 --> 58:31.203
Here we go. Woo-hoo!

58:33.771 --> 58:35.816
Buddy, you're lucky
we got here in time.

58:35.816 --> 58:38.558
What are you doing with
an open fire in there anyways?

58:38.558 --> 58:39.777
That's completely illegal.

58:41.169 --> 58:43.171
Hey, Ricky. The <i>Mona Lisa.</i>

58:43.171 --> 58:45.652
It's missing, ain't it?

58:45.652 --> 58:47.654
Yeah.

58:47.654 --> 58:49.003
I-Is it?

58:49.003 --> 58:51.658
- Yeah.
- It's right there.

58:51.658 --> 58:54.705

the jersey back.

59:05.150 --> 59:07.848
You okay, buddy?

59:11.896 --> 59:13.201
Wow, Bernie.

59:13.201 --> 59:15.029
Been a busy night, huh?

59:15.029 --> 59:16.988
Yeah, it sure has.

59:19.425 --> 59:22.167
Hey, we'll get you out, buddy.

59:22.167 --> 59:24.604
- Stay strong.

59:39.271 --> 59:40.881
Okay, kid.

59:40.881 --> 59:43.188
The good news is that
it's gonna take a bit

59:43.188 --> 59:45.930
to extradite you to France, so...

59:45.930 --> 59:49.716
you'll be here in a nice, warm
American cell over Christmas.

59:49.716 --> 59:52.371
- Mm-hmm.
- It's not very good news.

59:52.371 --> 59:54.895
I mean, if...

59:54.895 --> 59:56.680
if I miss Christmas,

59:56.680 --> 59:58.290
my life is over.

59:58.290 --> 01:00:02.686
Missing Christmas is the least
of your problems, buddy.

01:00:03.687 --> 01:00:07.734
Do you know anything about
the French penal system?

01:00:07.734 --> 01:00:08.996
Uh, n-no.

01:00:08.996 --> 01:00:12.043
Think <i>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i>

01:00:12.043 --> 01:00:17.091
where everyone is dressed
like Inspector Clouseau.

01:00:17.091 --> 01:00:19.659
- This can't be happening.
- It's happening,

01:00:19.659 --> 01:00:22.749
but the solution is
quite simple.

01:00:22.749 --> 01:00:25.970
All you got to do...
Look at me, look at me.

01:00:27.711 --> 01:00:29.974
Tell me the truth. Come on.

01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:34.369
Okay, okay.

01:00:34.369 --> 01:00:36.110
Now we're talking.

01:00:36.110 --> 01:00:38.678
Okay. Okay.

01:00:38.678 --> 01:00:41.115
The-the truth is...

01:00:41.115 --> 01:00:43.161
I had an accomplice.

01:00:45.119 --> 01:00:47.818
Officer Pepper to the bullpen.

01:00:48.993 --> 01:00:51.299
Wow. Look at these digs.

01:00:51.299 --> 01:00:53.084
You do okay, don't you?

01:00:53.084 --> 01:00:54.955
-  Is that the bad guy?
- What?

01:00:54.955 --> 01:00:57.436
Nardo, I am here!
I am in the building!

01:00:57.436 --> 01:00:59.220
Eagle has landed.

01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:00.961
- Nardo, I am in the building.
Ma'am. Ma'am.

01:01:00.961 --> 01:01:03.790
- Please don't do that.
- Got it.

01:01:03.790 --> 01:01:06.097
I thought that's
what it was there for.

01:01:06.097 --> 01:01:09.056
So sor-- [gasps] Wha--
You guys both have guns.

01:01:09.056 --> 01:01:10.492
I just have my dagger.

01:01:10.492 --> 01:01:12.843
- What? No. Put your hands up!

01:01:12.843 --> 01:01:14.453
Oh, that's nice.

01:01:18.413 --> 01:01:19.719
Quit screwing around.

01:01:19.719 --> 01:01:20.720
Take your hat off.

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:21.895
Okay. I'll do that.

01:01:21.895 --> 01:01:24.245
Commencing interview.

01:01:25.551 --> 01:01:27.771
- Is-is this for me?
- Okay.

01:01:27.771 --> 01:01:29.163
Thank you very much.

01:01:29.163 --> 01:01:30.991
You're welcome.

01:01:32.384 --> 01:01:33.341
Name.

01:01:33.341 --> 01:01:35.126
- Mine?
- Yes.

01:01:35.126 --> 01:01:36.388
Oh, okay.

01:01:36.388 --> 01:01:40.087
Hi, there, um,
Flora Gwendolen Locheed,

01:01:40.087 --> 01:01:43.525
uh, Firepit McAllister Cruise.

01:01:43.525 --> 01:01:46.311
Is that, is that a "Cruz"
with a "U-Z"?

01:01:46.311 --> 01:01:47.921
- S-E.
- S-E.

01:01:47.921 --> 01:01:50.750
- As in, as in Tom.
- Okay.

01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:52.491
Date of birth.

01:01:52.491 --> 01:01:56.843
Let's see, it's second day of
the Feast of Angus the Fierce.

01:01:56.843 --> 01:01:59.367
Yes. Second day. -But
what year of the second day?

01:01:59.367 --> 01:02:02.283
- Oh, geez.
- I need a month. I need a year.

01:02:02.283 --> 01:02:05.809
You know what?
I'm gonna say 2,152 years ago

01:02:05.809 --> 01:02:08.420
is probably...

01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:11.031
I think
that's pretty darn close.

01:02:12.032 --> 01:02:17.429
Okay, we're gonna put down 1969
from the looks of it.

01:02:18.430 --> 01:02:20.127
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:02:20.127 --> 01:02:22.782
- What's your profession?
- How do I--

01:02:22.782 --> 01:02:25.567
Well, okay, I guess
the honest answer would be...

01:02:25.567 --> 01:02:27.482
I, you know, dabbled
in a little bit of

01:02:27.482 --> 01:02:30.355
being a warrior/hunter-gatherer,

01:02:30.355 --> 01:02:33.880
but now, really, I strictly
just, uh, I'm a genie.

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:36.056
Uh, what was the last part?

01:02:36.056 --> 01:02:39.190
Uh, but now
I'm, uh, just a genie.

01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:41.061
Okay.

01:02:42.846 --> 01:02:44.369
You believe that you're a genie?

01:02:44.369 --> 01:02:46.284
Well, I know I'm a genie.

01:02:46.284 --> 01:02:48.982
- You know you're a genie?
- Yes, because I'm a genie.

01:02:49.983 --> 01:02:51.550
Uh, so, what kind of
prescription drugs

01:02:51.550 --> 01:02:52.594
are you on now?

01:02:52.594 --> 01:02:53.987
Ooh.

01:02:53.987 --> 01:02:55.293
I don't know.
What have you got?

01:02:55.293 --> 01:02:56.990
What are you offering?

01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:00.472
Okay, look, uh...

01:03:00.472 --> 01:03:02.430
I'm gonna be honest with you.

01:03:02.430 --> 01:03:05.520
I don't know if this is
some kind of bit you're doing,

01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:09.133
you're crazy, or what, but...

01:03:09.133 --> 01:03:10.395
I want to run with this
for a second.

01:03:10.395 --> 01:03:12.353
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:03:12.353 --> 01:03:14.442
So you are this magical genie.

01:03:14.442 --> 01:03:17.271
- That's correct.
- So, if that's the case,

01:03:17.271 --> 01:03:19.317
you have to know exactly

01:03:19.317 --> 01:03:22.581
what you and your friend Bernard
are in for with prison.

01:03:22.581 --> 01:03:24.539
Okay? You're gonna be stuck

01:03:24.539 --> 01:03:27.325
in a little square box
for eternity.

01:03:28.587 --> 01:03:30.502
No friends.

01:03:30.502 --> 01:03:32.156
No family.

01:03:32.156 --> 01:03:34.245
No freedom.

01:03:34.245 --> 01:03:37.291
How does that sound to you?

01:03:40.555 --> 01:03:42.470
Familiar.

01:03:59.444 --> 01:04:01.315
Get ready, buddy boy.

01:04:01.315 --> 01:04:03.448
December 23.

01:04:03.448 --> 01:04:05.493
Guess where you're going?

01:04:05.493 --> 01:04:07.495
JFK.

01:04:07.495 --> 01:04:10.672
We're transferring you
and Ms. McAllister to France

01:04:10.672 --> 01:04:13.066
immediately.

01:04:13.066 --> 01:04:15.547
Goodbye. Arrivederci.

01:04:15.547 --> 01:04:18.202
Adios. Salaam alaikum salaam.

01:04:20.378 --> 01:04:22.946
Right, well, I-I guess we're
just gonna have to live

01:04:22.946 --> 01:04:24.991
with the consequences
of our actions.

01:04:24.991 --> 01:04:28.212
Right? Just-just two crooks

01:04:28.212 --> 01:04:29.996
in the back of
a high-security van,

01:04:29.996 --> 01:04:32.346
wishing they'd never got greedy.

01:04:32.346 --> 01:04:34.914
You're funny, that's
what I like about you, Bernard.

01:04:34.914 --> 01:04:37.525
Like, as if we're gonna put you
both in the same vehicle

01:04:37.525 --> 01:04:40.702
for hours so you could get
your story straight.

01:04:40.702 --> 01:04:43.531
What kind of idiots
do you think we are?

01:04:45.359 --> 01:04:46.491
Right.

01:04:46.491 --> 01:04:49.146
Hey. Get him out.

01:04:55.326 --> 01:04:57.067
Hmm.

01:05:09.775 --> 01:05:12.038
Flora!

01:05:12.038 --> 01:05:14.432
I wish we could swap back!

01:05:14.432 --> 01:05:16.434
Oh, so now
you want to talk, huh?

01:05:23.006 --> 01:05:24.485
Hey, hey.

01:05:24.485 --> 01:05:25.530
- All right, come on.
- Flora, it's me, it's Bernie.

01:05:25.530 --> 01:05:27.314
I wish we could swap back.

01:05:27.314 --> 01:05:29.012
- I wish we could swap back.
Hey, buddy, buddy.

01:05:29.012 --> 01:05:30.578
I wish we could
swap that painting back.

01:05:30.578 --> 01:05:31.579
Get him out of here.

01:05:35.235 --> 01:05:37.063
Seriously.

01:05:37.063 --> 01:05:39.065
- You okay?
- Yeah, thanks.

01:05:39.065 --> 01:05:40.153
Wow.

01:05:46.029 --> 01:05:47.291
- Yeah?
Detective Perez,

01:05:47.291 --> 01:05:48.988
we have the French.

01:05:48.988 --> 01:05:51.469
- The French? Put 'em on.
- Yeah.

01:05:54.646 --> 01:05:56.343
Bonjour.

01:06:01.305 --> 01:06:04.134
Bring me the painting!

01:06:05.222 --> 01:06:07.224
It's not a painting, sir.

01:06:07.224 --> 01:06:09.095
I know it's not a painting.

01:06:09.095 --> 01:06:11.184
It's <i>the</i> painting.

01:06:11.184 --> 01:06:14.274
The most valuable painting
in the world.

01:06:14.274 --> 01:06:15.972
You're not gonna
like this, boss.

01:06:18.452 --> 01:06:19.714
It's a jersey.

01:06:23.066 --> 01:06:25.242
I'm gonna have to kill someone.

01:06:27.722 --> 01:06:30.421
- That was close.
- Way too close.

01:06:30.421 --> 01:06:32.292
We could've been fairly
and squarely screwed.

01:06:32.292 --> 01:06:34.033
The wishing has to stop, right?

01:06:34.033 --> 01:06:35.817
Well, yeah, maybe.

01:06:35.817 --> 01:06:37.384
- Except...
- Except what?

01:06:37.384 --> 01:06:38.820
Well, I mean,
except Julie and Eve

01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:40.300
are gonna arrive at mine
any minute.

01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:41.649
Okay, that's okay.
I mean, this is like

01:06:41.649 --> 01:06:44.261
classic Flora and Nardo stuff, right?

01:06:44.261 --> 01:06:47.307
I mean, kicking names
and taking butts.

01:06:47.307 --> 01:06:48.700
This is what we do.

01:06:50.658 --> 01:06:52.312
- Uh...
- Okay.

01:06:52.312 --> 01:06:54.140
So, yeah, they're nearly here, so...

01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:56.099
- Okay, okay. What do we do?
- So...

01:06:56.099 --> 01:06:58.144
Oh, uh...

01:06:58.144 --> 01:07:00.407
Just wondered if you could
maybe go invisible.

01:07:00.407 --> 01:07:01.843
You know, just...

01:07:01.843 --> 01:07:03.193
- Just-- Yeah.
- No, that's-- No, of course.

01:07:03.193 --> 01:07:04.498
That's the right thing.

01:07:04.498 --> 01:07:06.718
- Okay, good luck.
- Thank you.

01:07:18.469 --> 01:07:20.340
Bye, Grandma.

01:07:24.562 --> 01:07:26.433
- Hey, hey, sweetie.
- Dad!

01:07:26.433 --> 01:07:28.609
Ah.

01:07:28.609 --> 01:07:30.524
- How you doing? Yeah?
- Good.

01:07:30.524 --> 01:07:32.526
- Hey.
- Hey, um, all right.

01:07:32.526 --> 01:07:34.137
Well, I'll leave you to it.

01:07:34.137 --> 01:07:36.835
- Thank you.
- Have a good time, you two.

01:07:36.835 --> 01:07:38.402
- Yeah. Uh, you, too.
- Bye, Mom.

01:07:38.402 --> 01:07:40.360
Yeah.

01:07:43.537 --> 01:07:45.191
What you got in the bag, huh?

01:07:45.191 --> 01:07:47.193
You look so cute in this jumper.

01:07:47.193 --> 01:07:48.325
- Thank you.
- Where'd you get it?

01:07:48.325 --> 01:07:49.848
Oh, Grandma got it for me.

01:07:49.848 --> 01:07:51.371
Grandma got it for you.
Did you get me anything?

01:07:51.371 --> 01:07:53.765
Mm. Sorry.

01:08:01.338 --> 01:08:02.904
This is the big chimney, right?

01:08:02.904 --> 01:08:05.559
How many little chimneys
can you put there?

01:08:05.559 --> 01:08:07.822
You have to make sure you don't
tell Mum that we've exclusively

01:08:07.822 --> 01:08:09.781
been eating sugar
for the last 48 hours.

01:08:09.781 --> 01:08:11.435
I won't.

01:08:11.435 --> 01:08:12.784
I can keep a secret.

01:08:12.784 --> 01:08:14.394
I never told Mom
about you smoking

01:08:14.394 --> 01:08:15.569
when she was
at her high school reunion.

01:08:15.569 --> 01:08:17.919
BERNARD and FLORA:
Oh!

01:08:17.919 --> 01:08:19.791
Burn.

01:08:19.791 --> 01:08:22.272
But you still kind of
keep things from me.

01:08:22.272 --> 01:08:24.274
Me? What are you talking about?

01:08:24.274 --> 01:08:25.579
I'm your dad.
I tell you everything.

01:08:25.579 --> 01:08:27.146
Dad, all of a sudden,

01:08:27.146 --> 01:08:29.714
there's a random lady
living in our house?

01:08:31.629 --> 01:08:33.544
Oh, she's good. Real good.

01:08:34.719 --> 01:08:37.765
Okay. Well, I mean,
the-the truth...

01:08:37.765 --> 01:08:38.766
I mean, do you want to
do the honors?

01:08:38.766 --> 01:08:40.246
You're the boss.

01:08:40.246 --> 01:08:42.683
Yeah, of course.
I forget that sometimes.

01:08:42.683 --> 01:08:44.250
Okay, I'm gonna tell her.
I'm gonna tell you.

01:08:44.250 --> 01:08:45.512
- Listen, okay.
- Mm-hmm.

01:08:45.512 --> 01:08:47.253
So, um...

01:08:47.253 --> 01:08:48.776
Flora here, fabulous Flora...

01:08:48.776 --> 01:08:50.865
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

01:08:54.434 --> 01:08:55.740
She's a genie.

01:08:55.740 --> 01:08:57.481
Ta-da.

01:08:57.481 --> 01:08:59.178
Dad, I'm eight.

01:08:59.178 --> 01:09:00.745
You got to come up
with something better than that.

01:09:00.745 --> 01:09:02.486
-  No, it's true.
- That's a tough cookie.

01:09:02.486 --> 01:09:04.270
- Wow.
- She is. She really is.

01:09:04.270 --> 01:09:06.316
So, Flora, you're a genie?

01:09:06.316 --> 01:09:07.839
- I am.
- So, in that case,

01:09:07.839 --> 01:09:09.797
you must have
a magic flying carpet.

01:09:09.797 --> 01:09:12.539
- Funny you should mention that.

01:09:28.338 --> 01:09:30.775
- Hey, should we have some fun?
- Yeah!

01:09:42.874 --> 01:09:44.354
Let's go, let's go!

01:09:47.226 --> 01:09:48.706
Yeah!

01:09:50.708 --> 01:09:52.666
Oh, oh, oh,
look at this guy. Wait.

01:09:53.754 --> 01:09:55.234
- Go home!

01:09:55.234 --> 01:09:57.715
- It's Christmas!
- Go home!

01:10:01.066 --> 01:10:02.981
Whoa!
Did you see his face?

01:10:17.082 --> 01:10:19.911
- Ready to go to Grandma's?
- Mm-hmm.

01:10:23.654 --> 01:10:25.612
Thank you, Flora.

01:10:25.612 --> 01:10:27.310
That was the best day
of her life.

01:10:36.971 --> 01:10:41.367
So, you've done everything
for Julie and Eve.

01:10:41.367 --> 01:10:43.587
I was just wondering
if there's maybe something

01:10:43.587 --> 01:10:45.980
that <i>you</i> want for Christmas.

01:10:47.765 --> 01:10:49.723
Well, you know what?
I-I did have

01:10:49.723 --> 01:10:51.421
one or two little thoughts.

01:10:52.422 --> 01:10:54.728
And finally,
a charming Christmas story.

01:10:54.728 --> 01:10:57.078
This evening,
the Bowery Mission received

01:10:57.078 --> 01:10:59.472
an unexpected donation
from Oliver Flaxman,

01:10:59.472 --> 01:11:02.345
owner of New York's own
Flaxman's Auction House.

01:11:02.345 --> 01:11:04.912
The check for $100 million
makes up

01:11:04.912 --> 01:11:07.480
the entirety of
Flaxman's personal fortune,

01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:09.613
and it will go towards
feeding and caring

01:11:09.613 --> 01:11:11.092
for the unhoused this Christmas.

01:11:11.092 --> 01:11:13.399
We go down to
Flaxman's Auctions now,

01:11:13.399 --> 01:11:15.532
where a grateful crowd
has gathered.

01:11:15.532 --> 01:11:16.968
Mr. Oliver Flaxman?

01:11:18.317 --> 01:11:19.927
- Uh, yes.
- What made you make

01:11:19.927 --> 01:11:22.887
such an incredibly
generous gesture?

01:11:22.887 --> 01:11:24.758
What gesture?

01:11:24.758 --> 01:11:26.456
Oh, my God. -REPORTER: Well,
the Bowery Mission just received

01:11:26.456 --> 01:11:29.763
a $100 million charity check
from you. -Oh, wait.

01:11:29.763 --> 01:11:32.679
Which was just deposited
to help feed the unhoused

01:11:32.679 --> 01:11:33.811
- this Christmas.

01:11:33.811 --> 01:11:35.769
That's right.

01:11:35.769 --> 01:11:37.989
Well, you've become a national
hero because of your generosity.

01:11:37.989 --> 01:11:39.991
I have?

01:11:39.991 --> 01:11:41.601
Could I, could I just have
a moment?

01:11:41.601 --> 01:11:42.776
Absolutely.

01:11:42.776 --> 01:11:45.431
- Yeah.
- You suck. Boo!

01:11:45.431 --> 01:11:46.606
- Boo.

01:11:46.606 --> 01:11:47.955
And what a wonderful story
that is.

01:11:47.955 --> 01:11:49.000
- That's it for tonight.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.915
From all of us here, goodbye

01:11:50.915 --> 01:11:53.091
- and very merry Christmas Eve.
- That's the way. Nicely done.

01:11:54.092 --> 01:11:57.138
Uh...
you got to be kidding me.

01:11:57.138 --> 01:12:01.012
This is it. Best present ever.

01:12:01.012 --> 01:12:02.492
What do you think?
Do you like it?

01:12:02.492 --> 01:12:03.623
- I-- Well, uh, come on.

01:12:04.972 --> 01:12:06.365
I don't know,
when-when we first met,

01:12:06.365 --> 01:12:07.714
I was, I was just...

01:12:07.714 --> 01:12:09.455
I was the most unhappy man
in the world.

01:12:09.455 --> 01:12:12.415
I'd-I'd lost everything,
but at least I have Eve back.

01:12:12.415 --> 01:12:13.633
Yeah.

01:12:13.633 --> 01:12:15.592
Now, I'm...

01:12:15.592 --> 01:12:17.376
you know,
I'm-I'm so much better,

01:12:17.376 --> 01:12:20.553
so I-I wanted to get you
something special for Christmas.

01:12:20.553 --> 01:12:22.163
And you have. I mean,
I have everything

01:12:22.163 --> 01:12:24.644
I could ever want.

01:12:24.644 --> 01:12:27.168
Well, not quite everything.

01:12:27.168 --> 01:12:29.649
Did-did you see the card
that came with it?

01:12:29.649 --> 01:12:32.652
Oh. What?

01:12:32.652 --> 01:12:34.654
Oh.

01:12:38.441 --> 01:12:40.399
Please be a hot chocolate
gift certificate.

01:12:40.399 --> 01:12:41.835
- Please.
- Just read the card.

01:12:41.835 --> 01:12:42.923
Read the card.

01:12:42.923 --> 01:12:44.838
Ah.

01:12:44.838 --> 01:12:46.579
That's great.

01:12:54.021 --> 01:12:55.371
I...

01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:03.596
We're equals, Flora.

01:13:03.596 --> 01:13:07.557
Now, how can things go well
for me and not for both of us?

01:13:10.951 --> 01:13:13.954
I don't think I remember
how to have my own life.

01:13:16.174 --> 01:13:18.394
I think you'll get
the hang of it.

01:13:19.525 --> 01:13:22.180
And I thought
the sweatshirt was good.

01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:24.574
- I mean, mm...

01:13:24.574 --> 01:13:26.576
- I mean, it is.

01:13:29.274 --> 01:13:31.798
Yeah, that's, um,
that's my last wish.

01:13:32.756 --> 01:13:35.541
How do you,
how do you want to do it?

01:13:35.541 --> 01:13:38.544
Well, it comes with a bit of...
of good news.

01:13:38.544 --> 01:13:41.939
Um, when a genie goes,

01:13:41.939 --> 01:13:44.942
you know, usually people realize
that they forgot something,

01:13:44.942 --> 01:13:47.727
so when I go,

01:13:47.727 --> 01:13:50.600
you're still allowed
three wishes.

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:53.559
No, that's where the three
wishes thing comes from.

01:13:53.559 --> 01:13:56.257
That's where the three wishes
thing comes from.

01:13:56.257 --> 01:13:59.565
You-you got any ideas?

01:13:59.565 --> 01:14:02.568
You know, I think
the whole point is that

01:14:02.568 --> 01:14:05.136
you'll know what you need
when it happens.

01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:08.966
So I'm just gonna leave that
to you, my friend.

01:14:22.022 --> 01:14:24.198
Should I do it?

01:14:25.722 --> 01:14:27.593
- Do it. Do it.
- Do it?

01:14:27.593 --> 01:14:29.160
Okay.

01:14:34.078 --> 01:14:35.949
I guess this is...

01:14:35.949 --> 01:14:37.951
this is the end.

01:14:37.951 --> 01:14:39.779
Yeah, I'm...
out of here.

01:14:39.779 --> 01:14:42.173
- Where are you gonna go?
- Uh...

01:14:42.173 --> 01:14:45.132
you know, I'm still
kind of mulling that over.

01:14:45.132 --> 01:14:47.221
I've actually thought
about going home.

01:14:47.221 --> 01:14:49.963
Some unfinished business
with a, uh,

01:14:49.963 --> 01:14:52.139
- sorcerer from hell.
- Yeah, but

01:14:52.139 --> 01:14:54.011
you can't go back in time.
That's rule number one.

01:14:54.011 --> 01:14:56.535
Uh, actually, that's...

01:14:56.535 --> 01:14:59.233
How do I put--?
That's not 100% true.

01:14:59.233 --> 01:15:02.585
For, as far as genie rule
number one, really,

01:15:02.585 --> 01:15:04.717
you-you tell the boss
that, you know,

01:15:04.717 --> 01:15:06.806
time travel is
out of the question

01:15:06.806 --> 01:15:08.895
because it's,
it's really dangerous.

01:15:08.895 --> 01:15:10.941
So it's for your protection
and also

01:15:10.941 --> 01:15:14.161
'cause people make horrible
decisions usually, so...

01:15:14.161 --> 01:15:16.163
But, I mean, is it literally

01:15:16.163 --> 01:15:18.905
out of the question? No.

01:15:18.905 --> 01:15:20.559
It's not.

01:15:20.559 --> 01:15:23.170
Right, so I could just
wish you back home?

01:15:23.170 --> 01:15:25.216
Well, I don't know, but, I mean,

01:15:25.216 --> 01:15:28.001
I'm still kind of
considering my options.

01:15:28.001 --> 01:15:30.177
I mean, really,
anything could happen.

01:15:30.177 --> 01:15:32.745
You know, I could end up
in Los Angeles with this guy.

01:15:32.745 --> 01:15:34.834
-You know, just
sitting by a pool. We don't,

01:15:34.834 --> 01:15:36.836
we don't know, right?

01:15:36.836 --> 01:15:40.100
Oh, you know what? I almost...

01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:41.841
This is for you.

01:15:41.841 --> 01:15:43.887
And I know I said

01:15:43.887 --> 01:15:46.150
that your final three wishes

01:15:46.150 --> 01:15:48.935
are entirely up to you,
and that's-that's true,

01:15:48.935 --> 01:15:52.156
but maybe consider this
like a hint

01:15:52.156 --> 01:15:55.028
at what one of the wishes
could be.

01:16:02.819 --> 01:16:04.385
So what's it mean?

01:16:04.385 --> 01:16:06.562
We'll get to that in a minute.

01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:10.043
Okay, I want to say
something to you.

01:16:10.043 --> 01:16:12.350
Uh... and

01:16:12.350 --> 01:16:14.874
I just think it's important
that you really hear me.

01:16:14.874 --> 01:16:17.007
So years from now,

01:16:17.007 --> 01:16:19.009
when you're old,

01:16:19.009 --> 01:16:22.273
and gray, and probably
doughy in the middle.

01:16:22.273 --> 01:16:23.883
When you're sitting around

01:16:23.883 --> 01:16:25.842
reading stories
about my old pal,

01:16:25.842 --> 01:16:27.757
JC, in-in your,

01:16:27.757 --> 01:16:29.236
in your "Bibble" and--

01:16:29.236 --> 01:16:32.239
- It's Bible, but...
- Whatever.

01:16:32.239 --> 01:16:34.241
When you come to the phrase,

01:16:34.241 --> 01:16:36.896
"The multitude gathered,"

01:16:36.896 --> 01:16:39.420
I want you to remember

01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:42.423
that one of 'em found you

01:16:42.423 --> 01:16:46.253
to be the very best friend
that she'd ever had.

01:16:47.428 --> 01:16:49.343
Okay? And, uh,

01:16:49.343 --> 01:16:51.824
I never really
trusted people because...

01:16:51.824 --> 01:16:54.087
they're greedy
and they're selfish.

01:16:57.134 --> 01:16:59.049
But, Bernard,

01:16:59.049 --> 01:17:02.139
that's not ever you.

01:17:08.406 --> 01:17:11.191
This is all getting
a bit too emotional.

01:17:11.191 --> 01:17:13.846
I-I-I wish you'd just go.

01:17:13.846 --> 01:17:16.196
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I was, I was just--

01:17:27.164 --> 01:17:28.948
- It's so weird.
- I know.

01:17:28.948 --> 01:17:31.908
I can't believe she just left.
She just took off?

01:17:31.908 --> 01:17:33.779
Well, I mean, she didn't
so much as leave.

01:17:33.779 --> 01:17:35.302
She sort of disappeared,
you know?

01:17:35.302 --> 01:17:36.956
I thought we had a, you know--
She didn't say,

01:17:36.956 --> 01:17:38.305
she didn't say,
she didn't say goodbye.

01:17:38.305 --> 01:17:40.220
I know.
It's a complicated situation.

01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:42.440
The weird thing is
she left this thing for me

01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:44.790
and I-I can't make
head nor tail of it.

01:17:44.790 --> 01:17:47.358
- What? It's a number.
- I know, but...

01:17:47.358 --> 01:17:49.926
Maybe it's a...
international phone number.

01:17:49.926 --> 01:17:52.972
Yeah, that's a good idea
actually. Like a plus four-four?

01:17:52.972 --> 01:17:54.844
I don't know what that means.

01:17:56.019 --> 01:17:58.021
We're sorry
your call cannot be completed.

01:17:58.021 --> 01:17:59.892
- No.
- Oh!

01:17:59.892 --> 01:18:02.199
It's a lottery number.
She had a vision.

01:18:02.199 --> 01:18:04.723
We're gonna be rich.

01:18:04.723 --> 01:18:05.985
We'll just wait until
the drawing. -Wait, hold on.

01:18:05.985 --> 01:18:07.900
- Hold on. Pass me that pad.
- What?

01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:09.989
- This?
- Yeah.

01:18:14.385 --> 01:18:16.169
Oh, look at that.
You're doing math.

01:18:16.169 --> 01:18:19.172
I-- You never think you're
gonna use it and then you...

01:18:22.785 --> 01:18:25.135
You're a genius.
I could kiss you. -What?

01:18:25.135 --> 01:18:26.919
- What? What happened?
- Good night. Good night!

01:18:26.919 --> 01:18:28.225
Are we gonna win money?

01:18:28.225 --> 01:18:30.706
Just let me wet my beak.

01:18:32.446 --> 01:18:34.013
Flora,

01:18:34.013 --> 01:18:36.059
my dear friend,

01:18:36.059 --> 01:18:39.932
for the first
of my last three wishes,

01:18:39.932 --> 01:18:42.065
I wish

01:18:42.065 --> 01:18:44.197
I was back
to the very beginning.

01:21:00.507 --> 01:21:02.596
- What is this about?
- Mm.

01:21:04.207 --> 01:21:06.339
Mm.

01:21:08.994 --> 01:21:11.040
Dad!

01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:14.043
Oh, happy birthday, baby doll.

01:21:25.750 --> 01:21:27.926
How was work?

01:21:29.188 --> 01:21:30.624
I quit.

01:21:30.624 --> 01:21:32.931
Excuse me?

01:21:32.931 --> 01:21:35.934
Did you just say the thing
that I have been dreaming

01:21:35.934 --> 01:21:38.545
and-and hoping
and needing you to say

01:21:38.545 --> 01:21:41.418
for, I don't know,
what seems like a lifetime?

01:21:41.418 --> 01:21:43.028
I just figured I need to

01:21:43.028 --> 01:21:44.943
spend a bit more time
with my girls, you know?

01:21:44.943 --> 01:21:46.553
And at last, finally pursue

01:21:46.553 --> 01:21:48.947
that lifelong dream
of a career in modeling.

01:21:48.947 --> 01:21:50.601
Yeah, right.

01:21:50.601 --> 01:21:53.386
I've been telling you,
look at this face.

01:21:53.386 --> 01:21:56.259
Oh, Bernie,
that is such good news.

01:21:57.782 --> 01:22:00.524
I was really getting worried
that maybe someday

01:22:00.524 --> 01:22:03.353
soon we'd have to...

01:22:03.353 --> 01:22:05.311
Yeah, I know.

01:22:05.311 --> 01:22:07.400
No, you don't.

01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:09.925
Trust me, I do.

01:22:17.019 --> 01:22:18.281
Where are we going?

01:22:18.281 --> 01:22:21.110
Oh, yeah. I thought maybe

01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:23.329
this year we could do
something a little bit better

01:22:23.329 --> 01:22:25.244
than skating, I thought
we could take this divine,

01:22:25.244 --> 01:22:27.594
this sophisticated
young lady... -[screams] No!

01:22:27.594 --> 01:22:30.162
Let me go. -...out to
the finest restaurant in town.

01:22:30.162 --> 01:22:32.295
Ooh. -Yeah, I mean,
it's a very important birthday.

01:22:32.295 --> 01:22:34.079
- She's actually eight.
- Eight?

01:22:34.079 --> 01:22:35.472
- You're actually eight, right?
- I'm eight.

01:22:40.042 --> 01:22:41.434
<i>Uh, sorry, excuse me, sir.</i>

01:22:42.653 --> 01:22:44.611
Wow. What do you think, Eve?

01:22:44.611 --> 01:22:46.396
- It's so cool.
- Evening.

01:22:46.396 --> 01:22:48.093
Um, do you have
any spare tables?

01:22:48.093 --> 01:22:51.009
Tonight? Do we have
any spare tables tonight?

01:22:53.316 --> 01:22:55.535
Oh.

01:22:55.535 --> 01:22:57.276
I wish you did.

01:22:59.278 --> 01:23:02.629
Well, it so happens
that we do, sir.

01:23:02.629 --> 01:23:05.284
Come this way. Table for three.

01:23:05.284 --> 01:23:07.243
What did you do?

01:23:07.243 --> 01:23:08.418
I've got this.

01:23:08.418 --> 01:23:11.029
- You flexing, huh?

01:23:11.029 --> 01:23:14.250
You know, I think I'm gonna go
for the Cornish game hen.

01:23:14.250 --> 01:23:16.556
Very good choice, sir. Madam?

01:23:16.556 --> 01:23:19.168
Uh, if I could have
the truffle salad

01:23:19.168 --> 01:23:21.300
and, ooh, the steak tartare?

01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:22.736
Certainly, madam.

01:23:22.736 --> 01:23:24.477
And for you, young lady?

01:23:24.477 --> 01:23:27.350
Peanut butter sandwiches
and cherry ice cream, please?

01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:29.700
I'm afraid we absolutely
cannot serve anything

01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:31.615
that is not on the menu.

01:23:38.796 --> 01:23:40.798
- I wish you could.

01:23:40.798 --> 01:23:44.758
However, seeing as you
asked exceptionally nicely,

01:23:44.758 --> 01:23:47.631
peanut butter sandwiches
and cherry ice cream coming up,

01:23:47.631 --> 01:23:49.372
mademoiselle.

01:23:49.372 --> 01:23:50.808
And perhaps some french fries
and a Coke float?

01:23:50.808 --> 01:23:52.331
Thank you.

01:23:52.331 --> 01:23:54.420
- Thank you. That is sweet.

01:23:54.420 --> 01:23:56.161
Give me some birthday luck.

01:23:56.161 --> 01:23:57.815
You know,

01:23:57.815 --> 01:24:00.252
um, a little toast.

01:24:02.385 --> 01:24:05.388
To my exquisite,

01:24:05.388 --> 01:24:08.217
so-much-smarter-than-me wife.

01:24:09.392 --> 01:24:12.351
And to our hilarious,
now almost totally grown-up,

01:24:12.351 --> 01:24:14.310
little girl

01:24:14.310 --> 01:24:16.442
on her big birthday.

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:19.837
What more can a man
ever wish for?

01:24:22.318 --> 01:24:23.710
- Cheers.
Cheers.

01:24:23.710 --> 01:24:26.104
- Cheers.
