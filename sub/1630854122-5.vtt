Nadia Balan.
Born and raised in Bucharest.

[doorbell rings]

18:56.961 --> 18:58.528
Nadia Balan?

18:58.615 --> 18:59.312
We'd like to ask you
some questions

18:59.399 --> 19:00.965
about a Cosmina Dalca.

19:01.052 --> 19:02.619
- Do you speak English?

19:02.706 --> 19:04.099
- Is she okay?
- She's all right.

19:04.186 --> 19:05.231
Can we come in?

19:14.109 --> 19:16.067
- We met through the clinic.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.982
It can be difficult
to make friends

19:18.069 --> 19:19.723
in this line of work.

19:19.810 --> 19:22.335
- You and Cosmina
must have really hit it off.

19:22.422 --> 19:23.640
We saw her place.

19:25.381 --> 19:28.297
- Securing a flat can be
difficult in Bucaresti,

19:28.384 --> 19:29.994

She's young and beautiful,
so safety's important.

19:34.434 --> 19:37.132
Now, is helping her a crime?

19:37.219 --> 19:38.612
I was happy to offer guidance.

19:38.699 --> 19:40.222
The first pregnancy comes
with so many questions.

19:40.309 --> 19:44.226
And I suppose my role was
a bit like zâna nasa,

19:44.313 --> 19:45.271

19:45.358 --> 19:47.316

By my count, you're
expecting number six soon?

19:51.146 --> 19:52.452
Wow.

19:52.539 --> 19:54.018
Do you have any kids
of your own?

19:54.105 --> 19:55.672
- I like peace and quiet.

19:59.807 --> 20:02.201
- When was the last time
you and Cosmina spoke?

20:02.288 --> 20:04.986
- Well, a few weeks ago.

20:05.073 --> 20:07.423
I'm aware she was preparing
for the baby.

20:07.510 --> 20:10.121
By the end,
she was quite...troubled.

20:10.209 --> 20:11.645
- In what way?

20:11.732 --> 20:14.300
- The first time
is difficult, always,

20:14.387 --> 20:17.825
but it's almost as if she had
a crisis of conscience

20:17.912 --> 20:19.522
about parting
with that child.

20:19.609 --> 20:21.437
- In your time doing this,
have you ever become attached

20:21.524 --> 20:23.657
to any of your pregnancies?

20:23.744 --> 20:26.660
- Never,
but I can see why it happens.

20:26.747 --> 20:28.618
Easy to forget
that this is a transaction

20:28.705 --> 20:31.621
and the soul inside is
a subject of a contract.

20:31.708 --> 20:34.407
- It seems like you had
a soft spot for Cosmina.

20:34.494 --> 20:37.236
If she asked you to undermine
an agreement, would you?

20:37.323 --> 20:42.284
- This is the ultimate gift
to hopeful parents.

20:42.371 --> 20:44.025
Are you sure Cosmina's okay?

20:44.112 --> 20:47.855
- Oh, she's safe,
but unfortunately,

20:47.942 --> 20:50.727
the baby was lost
during childbirth.

20:52.990 --> 20:54.601
- I didn't think anything of it
at the time,

20:54.688 --> 20:57.560
but she contacted me
a few days ago.

20:57.647 --> 20:58.909

it was weeks ago.

20:58.996 --> 21:00.694

21:00.781 --> 21:02.043
Our phone calls
are usually quite long,

21:02.130 --> 21:03.523

21:05.394 --> 21:08.310
She asked about coconut oil.

21:08.397 --> 21:10.834
It's common for newborns
to experience flaky skin,

21:10.921 --> 21:15.752
and the one I like
is gentle on them.

21:15.839 --> 21:18.494
Sometimes the baby stays
in our care for a few days

21:18.581 --> 21:20.366
until the parents are ready.

21:20.453 --> 21:23.891
But if the child
didn't survive...

21:23.978 --> 21:25.501
- Cosmina said
she gave birth six days ago.

21:27.198 --> 21:28.635
When did she reach out?

21:33.814 --> 21:35.424
- It's time
to cut Cosmina loose.

21:35.511 --> 21:37.078
- You need formal charges,
I get it,

21:37.165 --> 21:39.298
but something about her story
isn't adding up.

21:39.385 --> 21:40.908
- There's a reason
to keep a case alive,

21:40.995 --> 21:43.345
but forcing this young woman
to relive her pain

21:43.432 --> 21:44.607
does not appeal to me.

21:44.694 --> 21:45.869

the only victim here.

21:45.956 --> 21:46.957

this whole thing

21:47.044 --> 21:48.481

21:48.568 --> 21:49.743

when your bosses find out

21:51.266 --> 21:52.876

every step of the way.

21:52.963 --> 21:55.270

21:55.357 --> 21:57.446
Without hard proof,
I'm not keeping her caged.

21:57.533 --> 21:59.056

Raines cracked her phone.
You're gonna want to see this.

22:09.066 --> 22:10.590

have been decrypted.

22:10.677 --> 22:13.549
They all link back to one
caller who masked his digits.

22:13.636 --> 22:14.637

we interviewed here.

22:14.724 --> 22:15.986

22:16.073 --> 22:18.119
Somehow he knows Cosmina
and was calling her

22:18.206 --> 22:20.469

22:20.556 --> 22:22.036

22:31.393 --> 22:33.047

Former sales rep out of London.

22:33.134 --> 22:34.788
The guy's high net worth

22:34.875 --> 22:36.398

22:36.485 --> 22:38.574
His father-in-law runs SWP,

22:38.661 --> 22:40.184
a petroleum conglomerate
in the UK.

22:40.271 --> 22:41.403
- Company's major.

22:41.490 --> 22:44.145
It spans four generations.

22:44.232 --> 22:45.886
Think of them

22:48.018 --> 22:49.280

22:49.368 --> 22:51.718

a few years back.

22:51.805 --> 22:54.416
And his wife, Elizabeth,
she's clean as a whistle.

22:54.503 --> 22:57.550
I found a blog she kept
on their fertility journey.

22:57.637 --> 22:59.116
It goes into detail--

22:59.203 --> 23:01.902
specialists, IVF,
hormone treatment.

23:01.989 --> 23:03.251
Between these
and their bank statements,

23:03.338 --> 23:04.948
it paints a picture.

23:05.035 --> 23:06.950
- All their resources still
couldn't get them a family.

23:07.037 --> 23:08.691
- And yet,
they never adopted.

23:08.778 --> 23:10.432
What's the timeline here?

23:10.519 --> 23:12.652
- Howard and his wife arrived
in Bucharest a few days ago,

23:12.739 --> 23:14.393
right around
Cosmina's due date.

23:14.480 --> 23:17.265
- He said he was at the clinic
to visit the facilities.

23:17.352 --> 23:19.223
Why is he calling Cosmina?

23:19.310 --> 23:21.008
- Well, either she was
a candidate for him,

23:21.095 --> 23:22.313
a future surrogate,

23:22.401 --> 23:26.143
or he wanted the child
she was carrying.

23:26.230 --> 23:29.538
- Cosmina isn't
telling us everything.

23:29.625 --> 23:31.235

23:38.547 --> 23:40.288

23:40.375 --> 23:42.072

23:42.159 --> 23:43.726
Now you're smart enough
to know that she could

23:43.813 --> 23:45.424
either corroborate
or poke holes in it.

23:45.511 --> 23:47.338
- I didn't tell her
about the lost child

23:47.426 --> 23:49.776
because I didn't want anyone
coming after her to get to me.

23:49.863 --> 23:52.169
- Well, we know
about the coconut oil.

23:52.256 --> 23:54.781
So why ask her about it
if the newborn didn't survive?

23:54.868 --> 23:57.958
- Because it was for me,
not the baby.

23:58.045 --> 23:59.568
When you lose a child,

23:59.655 --> 24:01.744

24:10.013 --> 24:12.712

I'm still scared.

24:18.631 --> 24:20.328

24:57.844 --> 24:59.585
