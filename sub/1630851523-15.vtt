WEBVTT

00:05.092 --> 00:10.097
Ooh, what a spread.
Eggs, meats, cheese, patisserie.

00:10.140 --> 00:12.447
What is this, breakfast for one
at Ben Franklin's house?

00:12.490 --> 00:14.492
Oh, well, we just wanted
to surprise you guys.

00:14.536 --> 00:15.798
Please tell Sass

00:15.841 --> 00:17.669
that I looked up the
traditional Lenape recipe

00:17.713 --> 00:18.888
for corn bread, okay?

00:18.931 --> 00:21.717
Mmm, just like kohèsa
used to make.

00:21.760 --> 00:24.111
That means "mom." And
now I miss my mom. Cool.

00:24.154 --> 00:25.634
Oh, my God.

00:25.677 --> 00:28.245
The 1998 Women of Wall Street
Swimsuit Calendar.

00:28.289 --> 00:31.422
But when I said I wanted it,
you called me a "big-time perv."

00:31.466 --> 00:33.511
Yeah, but then I thought
about it, and hey,

00:33.555 --> 00:36.210
it's not that misogynistic
that they asked a bunch of MBAs

00:36.253 --> 00:37.733
to wear bikinis
for a photo shoot.

00:37.776 --> 00:40.301
So, yay, enjoy
smelling breakfast.

00:40.344 --> 00:42.042
Oh, you guys, this is so nice.

00:42.085 --> 00:43.565
I don't know.

00:43.608 --> 00:45.523
This whole breakfast
reminds me of when my parents

00:45.567 --> 00:47.438
took me to Toys "R" Us
right before they told me

00:47.482 --> 00:48.874
they were getting a divorce.

00:48.918 --> 00:50.093
ALBERTA:
[gasps] Oh, my God.

00:50.137 --> 00:51.660
Sam and Jay are
getting a divorce.

00:51.703 --> 00:53.053
Guys, no.
[laughs]

00:53.096 --> 00:55.098
Geez, we are not
getting a divorce.

00:55.142 --> 00:57.622
That said, we did
want to talk to you,

00:57.666 --> 01:00.234
because since we're four weeks
away from opening the B&B,

01:00.277 --> 01:02.236
we need to start getting
the bedrooms ready.

01:02.279 --> 01:04.586
Bedroom-- Which bedrooms?
Our bedrooms?

01:04.629 --> 01:06.979
Well, four of them. So we're
gonna need you guys to bunk up.

01:07.023 --> 01:09.895
Unless you want to be walked
through by painters and handymen

01:09.939 --> 01:11.593
and, God willing, guests.

01:11.636 --> 01:13.551
[all groaning]Well, now those waffles

01:13.595 --> 01:14.944
smell like deception.

01:14.987 --> 01:16.946
[sniffs]
Mmm. And vanilla.

01:16.989 --> 01:18.426
Nice touch.

01:18.469 --> 01:20.515
♪

01:23.300 --> 01:25.824
SAMANTHA:
Okay, so big congratulations

01:25.868 --> 01:27.957
to Alberta and Flower
for agreeing

01:28.000 --> 01:29.480
to be our first roommate pair.

01:29.524 --> 01:31.439
I haven't had roommates
since the cult.

01:31.482 --> 01:33.136
We were like sisters.

01:33.180 --> 01:34.659
Well, technically,
sister-wives,

01:34.703 --> 01:36.226
because of the sex.

01:36.270 --> 01:38.707
HETTY: Well, now there's an
uneven number of men and women,

01:38.750 --> 01:40.143
so I guess I'm on my own.

01:40.187 --> 01:41.753
Sorry, Hetty,
there's no room for that.

01:41.797 --> 01:42.972
Why don't you just
bunk with Isaac?

01:43.015 --> 01:44.887
Why would that be okay?

01:45.801 --> 01:48.151
Because, well, you guys

01:48.195 --> 01:50.110
are old-timey and stuff.

01:50.153 --> 01:53.374
HETTY: It's true, we are of
a similar elevated status

01:53.417 --> 01:56.116
and share a mutual appreciation
of the finer things.

01:56.159 --> 01:58.466
Well, I suppose
if we must cohabitate,

01:58.509 --> 02:01.730
I could do much worse
than the lady of the house.

02:01.773 --> 02:04.950
Of course, as man and woman,
we will have to resist

02:04.994 --> 02:08.258
our natural impulses, but
I think we're up to the task.

02:08.302 --> 02:10.434
The Victorian age had
themselves some blind spots.

02:10.478 --> 02:14.264
Okay, time to discuss
elephant in room.

02:14.308 --> 02:17.354
Who get Thor? Everyone want
but only one can have.

02:17.398 --> 02:19.095
SAMANTHA:
Totally. Right, yeah.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.532
I sort of assumed that Sasappis
would just move in with you.

02:21.576 --> 02:23.186
SASAPPIS: And I'll be
the first to say

02:23.230 --> 02:25.493
that I do want that, very badly.

02:25.536 --> 02:27.712
You know, I mean, who-who
doesn't want to room with Thor?

02:27.756 --> 02:30.280
You know, he's got
the biggest room,

02:30.324 --> 02:31.499
and more importantly, that TV.

02:31.542 --> 02:33.370
I call it.
I'm rooming with Thor.

02:33.414 --> 02:34.154
Darn it.

02:34.197 --> 02:35.677
And Thor taken.

02:35.720 --> 02:36.678
Too slow, Sass.

02:36.721 --> 02:38.027
Yeah, suck it, Sass.

02:38.070 --> 02:40.247
So sad for me. I take Pete.

02:40.290 --> 02:42.292
Wow. I mean, I am
the last one left,

02:42.336 --> 02:43.859
but color me flattered.

02:43.902 --> 02:45.208
And you will have
nothing short

02:45.252 --> 02:47.297
of a five-star experience
in Casa Pete.

02:47.341 --> 02:49.212
I'll even let you choose
where you'd like to sleep,

02:49.256 --> 02:50.996
the bed or the floor.

02:51.040 --> 02:53.216
Bed.Great choice.

02:54.348 --> 02:55.871
NIGEL:
I'm just saying,

02:55.914 --> 02:57.829
the Stamp Act wasn't so bad.

02:57.873 --> 02:59.875
You Revolutionaries
were so dramatic.

02:59.918 --> 03:03.052
Well, I'll give you this, Nigel,
if Patrick Henry trotted out

03:03.095 --> 03:05.359
that "Give me liberty or give me
death" line one more time,

03:05.402 --> 03:06.534
I would have puked.

03:06.577 --> 03:08.840
It's like, "We're at a party,
Pat. Relax."

03:08.884 --> 03:11.147
[both laugh]

03:11.191 --> 03:14.846
Well, this is my stop.
Same time tomorrow?

03:14.890 --> 03:16.021
Um...

03:16.065 --> 03:18.154
There was one thing.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.590
Oh.Uh...

03:19.634 --> 03:22.767
You know I've enjoyed our
daily walks, and...

03:22.811 --> 03:26.075
I've been considering
your new lodging requirements,

03:26.118 --> 03:28.251
and I thought that,

03:28.295 --> 03:30.949
should you find it
more amenable,

03:30.993 --> 03:32.690
you would be more than welcome

03:32.734 --> 03:35.693
to spend your nights
in the shed.

03:36.607 --> 03:39.262
With me.Um, where, precisely,

03:39.306 --> 03:41.917
would I be sleeping?

03:41.960 --> 03:44.093
Well, my cot, while flimsy,

03:44.136 --> 03:49.707
can support two persons
of technical weightlessness.

03:49.751 --> 03:52.884
You are too kind, and, um...
but I should think that, uh,

03:52.928 --> 03:55.757
one cot would be
quite crowded for two people.

03:55.800 --> 03:56.975
And, um, I'm a roller.

03:57.019 --> 03:59.151
I keep rolling.
I roll a lot, actually.

03:59.195 --> 04:01.284
Sometimes clear off
the bed, and, um...

04:01.328 --> 04:03.199
You know what?

04:04.592 --> 04:06.463
TREVOR:
Sam!

04:07.421 --> 04:08.813
Hey, you know the rules.

04:08.857 --> 04:09.684
No ghosts in our bedroom.

04:09.727 --> 04:11.294
We got a problem.

04:11.338 --> 04:12.600
No, no, no. No.

04:12.643 --> 04:14.776
[grunting]:
Thor's fault.

04:14.819 --> 04:16.038
Oh, my God.

04:16.081 --> 04:17.909
Yeah, see, he's been
doing this, like, an hour.

04:17.953 --> 04:19.346
I can't sleep like this.

04:19.389 --> 04:20.782
Have you tried waking him up?I'm not gonna do that.

04:20.825 --> 04:22.958
He could split me in two
with his axe.

04:23.001 --> 04:25.308
I would pop back together,
but it's not pleasant.

04:25.352 --> 04:26.875
[grunting]Thor.

04:26.918 --> 04:28.703
Thorfinn.[whispers]: Careful.

04:28.746 --> 04:30.444
Ah, torture.Thor.

04:30.487 --> 04:32.707
[shouting]

04:32.750 --> 04:34.099
[screams][gasps]

04:34.143 --> 04:35.449
Thor, Thor.

04:35.492 --> 04:37.320
It-It's me and
Trevor. No, just...

04:37.364 --> 04:39.409
You were having a nightmare.

04:39.453 --> 04:42.020
How do you know that?
Can you see in Thor's mind?

04:42.064 --> 04:44.066
What sort of dark magic is this?

04:44.109 --> 04:46.677
Uh, no, we know because you're
going psycho in your sleep.

04:46.721 --> 04:48.549
W-What are you dreaming about?

04:48.592 --> 04:50.202
That none of Trevor's business.

04:50.246 --> 04:52.030
How do you know
Thor even dreaming?

04:52.074 --> 04:54.642
Maybe you're asleep
and this is dream you're having.

04:55.773 --> 04:58.254
Okay, well, it seems
like the dream is over

04:58.298 --> 05:00.474
and I guess he's fine.

05:00.517 --> 05:02.519
So we should all just
get some shut-eye.

05:02.563 --> 05:06.262
TREVOR:
Yeah, I guess
he seems better.

05:08.482 --> 05:10.353
THORFINN:
Die!

05:10.397 --> 05:12.529
Brains!

05:12.573 --> 05:14.357
TREVOR:
Oy vey.

05:14.401 --> 05:16.490
I know I'm already dead,
but kill me.

05:16.533 --> 05:18.056
Oh, the night didn't
get any better?

05:18.100 --> 05:19.971
Trevor just came in.JAY: Hey, No Pants.

05:20.015 --> 05:21.799
Good morning.
[sniffs]

05:21.843 --> 05:23.801
Man, that coffee
smells delicious.

05:23.845 --> 05:25.542
Sass just came in,
super chipper.

05:25.586 --> 05:26.891
Wait a minute. You
never wanted to room

05:26.935 --> 05:28.632
with Thor in the
first place, did you?

05:28.676 --> 05:30.547
You tricked me. You tricked me.

05:30.591 --> 05:32.723
You knew about the nightmares.Okay, yes.

05:32.767 --> 05:35.247
After I died,
the two of us shared a wigwam.

05:35.291 --> 05:36.727
It was torture.

05:36.771 --> 05:38.381
Hold on, you're telling me
that Thor has been having

05:38.425 --> 05:40.557
the same night terrors
for 500 years?

05:40.601 --> 05:42.516
At least.And he won't talk about them?

05:42.559 --> 05:43.734
The dude needs help.

05:43.778 --> 05:45.127
Seriously,
we got to get that Viking

05:45.170 --> 05:46.563
to a therapist.Can you imagine?

05:46.607 --> 05:48.260
Trevor just joked
that Thor needs therapy.

05:48.304 --> 05:51.699
That's actually a great idea.

05:51.742 --> 05:53.483
What?Look, if this guy
has been suffering

05:53.527 --> 05:56.573
from night terrors
for half a millennium,

05:56.617 --> 05:58.314
that's some pretty
serious trauma.

05:58.358 --> 06:01.404
Okay, but he's a ghost.
He can't talk to a therapist.

06:01.448 --> 06:03.101
Right, but you could.

06:03.145 --> 06:04.929
And then you could just have
Thor sitting there with you,

06:04.973 --> 06:07.802
and you could pass off
his problems as your own.

06:07.845 --> 06:09.325
Thor can't leave
the property, Jay.

06:09.369 --> 06:10.674
Good point.

06:10.718 --> 06:13.242
So we have a therapist
make a house call,

06:13.285 --> 06:15.200
because you can't
leave the house

06:15.244 --> 06:16.854
because you're agoraphobic.

06:16.898 --> 06:17.942
That's not bad.

06:17.986 --> 06:18.856
This is crazy.

06:18.900 --> 06:20.336
Please, I can't take it anymore.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.294
I-I-- You got to help me.
I need to sleep.

06:22.338 --> 06:23.600
Right, okay, so just to recap,

06:23.644 --> 06:25.559
the plan is to have me
call a therapist,

06:25.602 --> 06:28.518
lie about not being able
to go outside so that I can

06:28.562 --> 06:31.652
secretly translate the problems
of a thousand-year-old Viking,

06:31.695 --> 06:33.741
who, by the way, doesn't even
want to talk about the problem,

06:33.784 --> 06:36.657
so we'll have to spring all this
on him and hope he agrees?

06:36.700 --> 06:38.746
Uh-huh.Okay.

06:38.789 --> 06:39.399
I guess that's what we'll do.

06:43.490 --> 06:45.361
THORFINN:
Land ship, land ship!

06:45.405 --> 06:47.450
Who is this strange visitor?[doorbell rings]

06:50.410 --> 06:52.412
Hi, you must be Dr. Long.

06:52.455 --> 06:55.937
Uh, I am Jay. I'm Sam's hubby.

06:55.980 --> 06:58.069
She-She's not talking
to you because of me.

06:58.113 --> 07:00.768
Her and I are, like--
We're-we're good.

07:01.072 --> 07:03.118
Look, I know
you're probably mad.

07:03.161 --> 07:05.294
Why? Because you call therapist

07:05.337 --> 07:07.557
when Thor already
refused to talk dreams?

07:07.601 --> 07:09.733
No, Thor thrilled.

07:09.777 --> 07:12.867
Thor not actually thrilled.
Thor use sarcasm.

07:12.910 --> 07:14.390
How do you know
what a therapist is?

07:14.434 --> 07:17.437
Because Thor watching
old reruns of Frasier.

07:17.480 --> 07:19.439
[chuckles]
Niles in particular,

07:19.482 --> 07:20.483
very funny.

07:20.527 --> 07:21.658
Only likes best coffee.

07:21.702 --> 07:23.443
Point is,

07:23.486 --> 07:28.056
Thor no talk feelings,
like Martin, father of Frasier.

07:28.099 --> 07:29.884
Fine. I'm moving back
into my old room.

07:29.927 --> 07:31.668
No, Trevor,
that's not an option.

07:31.712 --> 07:33.191
Well, I'm not dealing
with this mishigas.

07:33.235 --> 07:35.106
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

07:35.150 --> 07:38.501
We just need to respect that
Thor is afraid of his feelings.

07:38.545 --> 07:40.155
Okay? He's terrified.

07:40.198 --> 07:43.680
About as terrified as he is
of a Danish raiding party.

07:43.724 --> 07:46.378
THORFINN:
By the eye of the Allfather,
you bite your words.

07:46.422 --> 07:51.122
Thor's not afraid of Danes and
Thor's not afraid of therapy!

07:51.166 --> 07:55.170
Time to talk feelings!
[shouts, grunts]

07:55.213 --> 07:56.519
[laughs softly]

07:56.563 --> 07:58.869
THORFINN:
Feelings! I'll talk them.

07:58.913 --> 08:01.089
Oh, Isaac, aren't you
usually on your walk

08:01.132 --> 08:02.220
with Nigel right about now?

08:02.264 --> 08:03.265
I don't know why
you would just assume

08:03.308 --> 08:04.484
that I have plans with Nigel.

08:04.527 --> 08:06.137
I guess because
it seems like you guys

08:06.181 --> 08:07.922
are getting kind of close.Close?

08:07.965 --> 08:10.228
Me? And Nigel?

08:10.272 --> 08:12.100
[laughs]I mean,

08:12.143 --> 08:13.797
he's not even American.

08:13.841 --> 08:16.408
He probably doesn't even know
what a bald eagle looks like.

08:16.452 --> 08:18.715
I mean, I don't even know why
we're talking about him.

08:18.759 --> 08:20.543
What people should
be talking about

08:20.587 --> 08:23.677
is this Isaac and Hetty
situation.

08:23.720 --> 08:26.201
Man and woman
shacking up?

08:26.244 --> 08:28.203
Long history together?

08:28.246 --> 08:31.119
Things could get pretty amorous.
[laughs]

08:31.162 --> 08:32.990
I'd be wondering that.

08:33.034 --> 08:34.818
Are people wondering that?

08:34.862 --> 08:36.080
I was not wondering that.

08:36.124 --> 08:37.168
Well, why the hell not?!

08:37.212 --> 08:39.127
I am so sorry for my outburst.

08:39.170 --> 08:41.216
How's your day?

08:41.259 --> 08:44.393
So your agoraphobia keeps you
from stepping outside?

08:44.436 --> 08:46.351
Yeah, but I'm actually cool
with that.

08:46.395 --> 08:47.788
What I'm really
concerned by

08:47.831 --> 08:49.920
is these night terrors
that I've been having.

08:49.964 --> 08:51.313
Interesting.

08:51.356 --> 08:53.533
Could you walk me through
a typical episode?

08:53.576 --> 08:56.666
Uh-huh. I would be happy to talk
you through my last dream.

08:56.710 --> 08:59.843
Thor not talk.
Dream very painful.

08:59.887 --> 09:02.193
Because even though
it may be very painful,

09:02.237 --> 09:03.673
you won't be able to help me

09:03.717 --> 09:06.371
unless I tell you
what I'm going through.

09:06.415 --> 09:08.896
Yes, that's
usually how this works.

09:08.939 --> 09:09.853
[chuckles]

09:09.897 --> 09:10.985
Please, proceed.

09:11.028 --> 09:12.595
Fine.

09:12.639 --> 09:18.296
In dream, Thor in vast plain
with best friend Oskar.

09:18.340 --> 09:22.039
So, I'm in a vast plain
with my friend Oskar.

09:22.083 --> 09:23.214
He's...

09:23.258 --> 09:24.999
Norwegian.

09:25.042 --> 09:29.090
Thor very cold.
Every bone in body aching.

09:29.133 --> 09:31.919
Beard frozen in ice.

09:31.962 --> 09:34.704
Scrotum size of berry.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.272
It's pretty cold.

09:37.315 --> 09:40.231
Near fire there is rock.

09:40.275 --> 09:43.626
I grab it, raise it to the sky,

09:43.670 --> 09:46.803
and then I bring it down
and smash Oskar's skull!

09:46.847 --> 09:49.850
I-I pick up a rock
and I smash Oskar's head.

09:49.893 --> 09:50.590
Oh, my.

09:50.633 --> 09:51.634
Blood everywhere.

09:51.678 --> 09:53.418
Brains splatter up nose.

09:53.462 --> 09:55.029
There is, like,
blood everywhere.

09:55.072 --> 09:57.640
And brains up nose.
Tell her of the brains.

09:57.684 --> 09:59.511
I even get some brains
up my nose.

09:59.555 --> 10:01.862
LONG:
Now I need you to think,
does this dream

10:01.905 --> 10:04.038
remind you of something
that's happened in your life?

10:04.081 --> 10:04.995
Yes.

10:05.039 --> 10:06.214
It is exactly

10:06.257 --> 10:10.218
the same as day
I kill best friend Oskar.

10:10.261 --> 10:11.480
Oh, my God.

10:11.523 --> 10:13.395
Now that I
think about it,

10:13.438 --> 10:15.049
it is pretty similar to the time

10:15.092 --> 10:19.009
that I betrayed
my best friend Oskar.

10:19.053 --> 10:20.358
This was a big betrayal?

10:20.402 --> 10:21.490
Is ultimate betrayal!

10:21.533 --> 10:23.057
Thor monster!

10:23.100 --> 10:25.537
Thor, come back.

10:27.801 --> 10:31.021
Uh, Thor was my childhood dog.

10:31.065 --> 10:32.327
Tell me about him.

10:32.370 --> 10:35.286
And feel free to not take
so many long pauses.

10:35.330 --> 10:38.942
Yeah. Uh, he was a corgi.

10:38.986 --> 10:41.815
He liked socks.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.600
HETTY:
Good night, Isaac.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.602
Sleep well.

10:53.043 --> 10:54.479
Oh, what's happening?

10:54.523 --> 10:56.612
Oh, stop your games.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.701
You're a woman
with a comely nape,

10:58.745 --> 11:02.662
and this man wants to kiss it.

11:02.705 --> 11:04.620
He does?Yeah.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.840
Oh, my. Is this...

11:06.883 --> 11:10.365
Is this a seduction?
Am I being seduced?

11:10.408 --> 11:13.411
You most certainly are.
[laughs]

11:13.455 --> 11:14.935
Unless you don't want to be.

11:14.978 --> 11:18.416
No. Of course, I've considered
that romantic tensions

11:18.460 --> 11:20.288
could boil over between us.

11:20.331 --> 11:22.203
Ah, one would say
it's inevitable.

11:22.246 --> 11:24.074
[laughs]I just was surprised

11:24.118 --> 11:25.859
that it's taken
so very long.

11:25.902 --> 11:27.034
Mm, well, you know what?

11:27.077 --> 11:28.862
Let's slow this train down.

11:28.905 --> 11:32.996
No! I was overcome at first,
but I want this, Isaac.

11:33.040 --> 11:35.564
I want it badly
and I want it now.

11:35.607 --> 11:38.915
My nape, kiss it. Kiss my nape.Uh...

11:38.959 --> 11:40.221
Kiss it.

11:40.264 --> 11:42.484
Kiss my nape.Okay.

11:42.527 --> 11:45.008
Isaac? Oh, Isaac.

11:45.052 --> 11:48.229
My nape. Ooh...

11:48.272 --> 11:51.232
Oh, Isaac.

11:51.275 --> 11:53.190
Are you still with me, Isaac?

11:53.234 --> 11:55.976
[snoring]

12:04.419 --> 12:07.509
THORFINN: Oskar!Oh, dear.

12:07.552 --> 12:10.730
Forgive Thor for murder!

12:10.773 --> 12:12.470
Okay, therapy has made it
so much worse.

12:12.514 --> 12:14.168
He is twice as loud
as he was last night

12:14.211 --> 12:15.952
and I would say
ten times as violent.

12:15.996 --> 12:17.998
THORFINN: See eyeballs
crush like grapes!Oh, you know what?

12:18.041 --> 12:19.695
It's actually a lot quieter
in this room.

12:19.739 --> 12:20.478
I'm gonna sleep in here.

12:20.522 --> 12:21.741
No. You know the rules.

12:21.784 --> 12:24.787
Sam! You have fully
broken that man.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.789
I'm dead, but I still
need my beauty sleep.

12:26.833 --> 12:29.574
Hmm. I actually think it's
slightly quieter in here.

12:29.618 --> 12:30.924
Hmm. I'm staying.

12:30.967 --> 12:32.795
Absolutely not.Knock, knock.

12:32.839 --> 12:34.797
Sorry, meant to say
that before I entered.

12:34.841 --> 12:36.103
Uh, look, I don't want
to be a bother,

12:36.146 --> 12:37.844
but Thor's brutal screams
are sort of

12:37.887 --> 12:39.628
keeping Sass
and me awake.

12:39.671 --> 12:42.587
Oh, wow, they're kind
of muffled in here.

12:42.631 --> 12:44.285
Would it be okay if I stayed?

12:44.328 --> 12:45.677
No. No one is sleeping here.

12:45.721 --> 12:47.505
You can say that again.

12:47.549 --> 12:50.291
We're not leaving
until Thor stops screaming.

12:50.334 --> 12:51.727
PETE:
Oh, wait a second.

12:51.771 --> 12:52.989
It might be over.

12:54.904 --> 12:56.036
THORFINN:
Brains!

12:56.079 --> 12:57.907
No, it's not. I'm gonna-- Yeah.

12:59.866 --> 13:02.477
THORFINN:
Hell too good for me!

13:02.520 --> 13:05.132
Thor? Thorfinn? Thor.

13:05.175 --> 13:07.830
I'll take the bullet.THORFINN:Stings.

13:07.874 --> 13:10.398
Ah. Ah!Thor? Buddy?

13:10.441 --> 13:12.182
Buddy...[shouts]

13:14.750 --> 13:16.970
[all screaming][groans]

13:17.013 --> 13:18.798
Do it again. That was wild!

13:18.841 --> 13:21.365
Thor, it-it's just us.

13:21.409 --> 13:23.019
You were having a nightmare.

13:23.063 --> 13:25.935
Was battling demon
in Muspelheim, land of fire.

13:25.979 --> 13:27.763
I was banished there
for murdering best friend.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.330
Oof, right.

13:29.373 --> 13:33.247
Look, Thor, I'm sorry
I pressured you into therapy.

13:33.290 --> 13:36.163
But I do think if you push
through and get a little deeper,

13:36.206 --> 13:38.861
you might be able to process
what happened and move on.

13:38.905 --> 13:40.254
Thor no deserve to move on.

13:40.297 --> 13:42.560
Thor deserve to spend
nights in Muspelheim,

13:42.604 --> 13:44.301
eating fire and cinder.

13:44.345 --> 13:47.391
SAMANTHA:
Thor, talk to us.
Tell us your story.

13:47.435 --> 13:49.872
Why did you kill Oskar?

13:49.916 --> 13:51.047
Fine.

13:51.091 --> 13:54.137
After shipmates
abandoned Thor,

13:54.181 --> 13:57.880
I wander completely
alone for months,

13:57.924 --> 14:01.841
but then I meet Oskar,
and we team up.

14:01.884 --> 14:04.756
We hunt together, camp together,

14:04.800 --> 14:10.284
we even make little bracelets
out of tall grass together.

14:10.327 --> 14:11.589
Very cute.

14:11.633 --> 14:13.243
Aww.He killed that guy.

14:13.287 --> 14:14.810
Well, let me enjoy the ramp-up.

14:14.854 --> 14:20.250
But then as the winter deepened,
we got hungrier, hungrier.

14:20.294 --> 14:22.078
Till one day,

14:22.122 --> 14:25.299
Thor so hungry he can't think.

14:26.474 --> 14:28.998
So I grab rock,

14:29.042 --> 14:33.916
I sneak up... and I
crush Oskar's skull!

14:33.960 --> 14:36.963
Gadzooks.I didn't even cook him.

14:37.006 --> 14:39.052
I ate him raw.

14:39.095 --> 14:42.838
And I ate his legs.
I ate his heart.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.058
Oh, damn it, Thor,
you ate your friend's heart?

14:45.101 --> 14:46.581
Thor so hungry, I...

14:47.669 --> 14:49.627
...I even ate his tail.

14:49.671 --> 14:52.456
Sorry, did-did you say "tail"?

14:52.500 --> 14:54.981
THORFINN:
What is so strange?

14:55.024 --> 14:56.634
Oskar is squirrel.

14:56.678 --> 14:57.374
What?Oh, my God.

14:57.418 --> 14:58.593
A squirrel?Come on.

14:58.636 --> 15:01.030
Pretty sure I say
this in beginning.

15:01.074 --> 15:03.076
Uh, no, you definitely did not.

15:03.119 --> 15:04.947
Pretty sure I did.No.

15:04.991 --> 15:06.427
Point is...

15:07.994 --> 15:12.912
...after friends abandoned
Thor, Oskar there for me.

15:12.955 --> 15:18.482
But when Oskar needed
me most, I eat him.

15:18.526 --> 15:20.397
Much shame.

15:20.441 --> 15:23.052
For Thor no better than
friends who leave me.

15:23.096 --> 15:25.707
No, Thor, you just did
what you had to do

15:25.750 --> 15:27.361
in a difficult situation.

15:27.404 --> 15:29.929
Also, dude, it's like,
it was a squirrel.

15:29.972 --> 15:31.669
Your friends
left a human being.

15:31.713 --> 15:33.019
You were just trying to survive.

15:33.062 --> 15:35.412
Any one of us would have
done the same thing.

15:35.456 --> 15:37.110
Yeah, you got to forgive
yourself, big guy.

15:41.114 --> 15:42.811
I...

15:42.854 --> 15:47.120
I have to admit,
saying secret out loud,

15:47.163 --> 15:51.559
it doesn't feel so bad.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.431
[soft laughter]

16:02.309 --> 16:03.832
[exhales]

16:04.659 --> 16:05.834
Hetty.

16:05.877 --> 16:07.444
Oh, Isaac.

16:07.488 --> 16:11.622
I came to apologize
for my undignified behavior

16:11.666 --> 16:13.189
earlier this evening.

16:14.190 --> 16:15.104
I, um,

16:15.148 --> 16:17.933
may have been, um,

16:17.977 --> 16:22.590
trying to prove something
to myself.

16:22.633 --> 16:24.461
The truth is,

16:24.505 --> 16:28.857
I have developed affections
for someone on the estate,

16:28.900 --> 16:31.468
but it's, um...

16:31.512 --> 16:33.079
[clears throat]

16:33.122 --> 16:35.951
Oh, wow. It feels like there's
an actual lump in my throat.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.127
Isaac...

16:38.171 --> 16:41.826
we've been friends
for 130 years.

16:41.870 --> 16:43.959
You can tell me anything.

16:45.700 --> 16:48.137
Okay, I'll say it.

16:48.181 --> 16:50.313
And then it's said.

16:55.362 --> 17:00.889
The person who
caught my eye is...

17:02.369 --> 17:03.805
...Nigel.

17:03.848 --> 17:05.937
[gasps]
Oh.

17:05.981 --> 17:08.157
Oh.

17:10.203 --> 17:15.338
Well, I'm slightly embarrassed
I didn't see it.

17:15.382 --> 17:16.905
Oh, no, don't be, don't be.

17:16.948 --> 17:18.428
I'm sure no one did.

17:18.472 --> 17:20.691
[exhales]
I don't, I don't know why

17:20.735 --> 17:22.911
this has been so hard for me.

17:22.954 --> 17:24.347
And I guess I just felt

17:24.391 --> 17:26.219
that if I ever spoke
of these matters out loud,

17:26.262 --> 17:29.004
it would mean that everything
that came before was a lie.

17:31.137 --> 17:33.530
But if that is what it takes
to speak the truth,

17:33.574 --> 17:34.923
then so be it.

17:34.966 --> 17:37.534
And I am so, so deeply sorryOh...

17:37.578 --> 17:39.449
for deceiving you.

17:43.410 --> 17:49.198
What you have been the past
two centuries is my dear friend.

17:50.243 --> 17:51.940
And that could never be a lie.

17:51.983 --> 17:55.074
You think you're ready
to tell Nigel?

17:55.117 --> 17:56.597
Couldn't be less ready.

17:56.640 --> 18:00.557
Oh.But one day,
hopefully, I will be.

18:00.601 --> 18:04.083
In the meantime,
it's just nice to have someone

18:04.126 --> 18:06.215
to share my actual
feelings with.

18:06.259 --> 18:09.305
Ooh, do you remember
that footman who worked here

18:09.349 --> 18:10.698
for about a week in the '30s

18:10.741 --> 18:12.352
before he got caught
stealing silverware?

18:12.395 --> 18:15.137
Oh, who, Clive?
No, I don't remember him at all,

18:15.181 --> 18:17.531
or the way he filled out
those khakis.

18:17.574 --> 18:19.446
[both laugh]

18:19.489 --> 18:22.101
It was wild.Oh, the only tragedy here

18:22.144 --> 18:23.711
is that we haven't been
doing this for years.

18:23.754 --> 18:25.582
Yes. We haven't, yes.

18:25.626 --> 18:27.584
Well, another ghost
problem solved.

18:27.628 --> 18:30.239
Oh, yeah? Did you get to the
bottom of the night terrors?

18:30.283 --> 18:33.329
Yeah, he, uh,
he ate his best friend.

18:33.373 --> 18:35.288
But his best friend
was a squirrel.

18:35.331 --> 18:39.074
Oh, that is sad
on a couple of levels.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.468
[chuckles]You know, babe,

18:41.511 --> 18:43.470
y-you don't have to use therapy

18:43.513 --> 18:46.212
to just talk about
ghost problems.

18:46.255 --> 18:50.433
You could also talk
about... ghost problems.

18:50.477 --> 18:52.435
Like the fact that you see them
and have to deal with that.

18:52.479 --> 18:54.698
Jay, I'm fine.Are you sure?

18:54.742 --> 18:56.178
I worry sometimes

18:56.222 --> 18:57.875
that you're dealing
with this huge crazy thing

18:57.919 --> 19:00.965
and I'm the only person that
you have to talk about it with.

19:01.009 --> 19:02.793
I mean, when it first happened,
I was pretty freaked out,

19:02.837 --> 19:05.405
but now I'm starting to think,
I don't know,

19:05.448 --> 19:07.146
maybe this all happened
for a reason.

19:07.189 --> 19:09.583
Like, maybe I'm supposed to help
the ghosts with their problems

19:09.626 --> 19:11.062
so they can move on.

19:11.106 --> 19:14.153
I am married
to a damn superhero.

19:15.502 --> 19:17.721
Ooh. It is on.

19:17.765 --> 19:21.203
Of course, it's not
without its downsides.

19:21.247 --> 19:22.944
Sorry, things heated
up kind of quickly.

19:22.987 --> 19:24.641
Just pretend we're not here.

19:24.685 --> 19:26.077
Let's go upstairs.

19:26.121 --> 19:28.167
ALBERTA: Oh, come on,
now. We have so little.

19:31.822 --> 19:33.781
And I guess
that ever since I saw

19:33.824 --> 19:37.263
his picture in the magazine,
I have been having these dreams,

19:37.306 --> 19:41.310
where I'm riding a black
stallion with Jason Momoa.

19:41.354 --> 19:44.270
And when we get thrown off,
he catches me

19:44.313 --> 19:47.316
and he lays me down
on a soft bed of grass.

19:47.360 --> 19:50.667
So I guess what-what
I'm wondering is...

19:50.711 --> 19:54.236
Go on. Ask her.[sighs]

19:54.280 --> 19:57.065
What I'm wondering is,
is there a way

19:57.108 --> 20:00.547
that I could make these dreams
happen more often?

20:00.590 --> 20:04.203
Okay, uh, there's a lot
to unpack here.

20:04.246 --> 20:06.596
Hey, so Thor
still healing,

20:06.640 --> 20:08.119
have other issue for talking.

20:08.163 --> 20:10.600
Uh-uh. Move it, buster.
This is my time.

20:10.644 --> 20:11.601
I'll be quick.

20:11.645 --> 20:12.820
Oh, fine.

20:12.863 --> 20:13.864
Would you mind if we just

20:13.908 --> 20:15.126
switched gears for a second?

20:15.170 --> 20:16.476
It's your hour.

20:16.519 --> 20:18.739
Totally. Let me think about
how to put this.

20:18.782 --> 20:21.089
So, many moons ago,
during Viking funeral,

20:21.132 --> 20:22.438
I was meant to be sucked off,

20:22.482 --> 20:25.224
and pretty hippie woman
say she love Thor,

20:25.267 --> 20:27.356
which feel very good.

20:27.400 --> 20:29.271
But then I am not sucked off,

20:29.315 --> 20:31.752
and suddenly
she does not love Thor,

20:31.795 --> 20:34.145
which feel very bad.

20:34.189 --> 20:35.799
Uh...

20:35.843 --> 20:38.846
Don't forget "sucked off" part.
Important for context.

20:38.889 --> 20:39.586
Oh, boy.
