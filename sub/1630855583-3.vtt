<i>Before Ben fell,
what if he grabbed for something?</i>

00:04.838 --> 00:06.757
You're using Ben's opening night gift.

00:06.757 --> 00:08.175
I didn't think I'd need it so soon.

00:08.175 --> 00:11.136
I did security for Ben.
Ben wants to say hi.

00:11.136 --> 00:13.096
- Okay, we have to go.
- Help! Help!

00:13.096 --> 00:14.806
- What?
- Where'd you get that hankie?

00:14.806 --> 00:15.766
- Hands up!
- I didn't do anything.

00:15.766 --> 00:17.559
I think the police have the wrong guy.

00:17.559 --> 00:20.145
This is my manager, Dickie.

00:20.145 --> 00:22.105
He's not just my manager,
he's also my brother.

00:22.105 --> 00:24.274
And this is my documentarian, Tobert.

00:24.274 --> 00:27.277
I am just an observer. This is literally
the last time you're gonna hear my voice.

00:27.277 --> 00:28.654
The show may be over,

00:28.654 --> 00:31.365
but doesn't that mean

00:31.365 --> 00:34.910
we're not obliged to live
by your show rule anymore?

00:34.910 --> 00:36.453
They're taking down my sets.

00:36.453 --> 00:39.581
This one... just didn't sing.

00:39.581 --> 00:42.584
I'm listening to my heart,
and re-imagining <i>Death Rattle</i>

00:42.584 --> 00:44.503
in the most Oliver Putnam way.

00:44.503 --> 00:46.380
It's a musical.

00:46.380 --> 00:49.132
We think that Ben's killer
is someone in your show.

00:49.132 --> 00:50.968
Which means...

00:50.968 --> 00:51.969

Donna and Cliff are gonna

01:52.696 --> 01:56.116
Howard, what do we have for our producers?
- We have one complete song,

01:56.116 --> 01:58.577
uh, 11 fragments, and-- Ooh!

01:58.577 --> 02:00.704
Uh, 25 rough notions
screamed over piano chords.

02:00.704 --> 02:03.540
Maybe one night wasn't enough time
to write a whole show.

02:03.540 --> 02:04.541
Are you kidding?

02:04.541 --> 02:08.378
One night in 1978, I wrote <i>two</i> musicals
in George Plimpton's bathroom.

02:09.171 --> 02:12.382
Or was it one musical in two nights?
It's all pretty hazy.

02:12.382 --> 02:14.384
The point is, Norman Mailer
punched me in the mouth,

02:14.384 --> 02:17.221
and when I woke up, I was in
Betty Friedan's waterbed.

02:17.221 --> 02:18.597
I love that story.

02:18.597 --> 02:20.641
Hey, Oliver, quick, crazy thought.

02:20.641 --> 02:24.102
My cousin, Moses Morris,
he's very big at State Farm Insurance...

02:25.395 --> 02:27.773
Howard, did you notice
how when I told a story,

02:27.773 --> 02:30.692
it had recognizable names <i>and</i> a point?

02:30.692 --> 02:33.153
No. Moses Morris
runs sponsorships for State Farm.

02:33.153 --> 02:36.949
So, what say I gave him a ring,
and maybe they sponsor the musical,

02:36.949 --> 02:39.701
and then we don't even need
Donna and Cliff. Bam!

02:40.869 --> 02:42.621
We don't need your...

02:42.621 --> 02:44.748
Moses Morris?
- Yeah.

02:45.749 --> 02:47.668
Everything we need is right here.

02:47.668 --> 02:50.671

<i>Any one of them could be the killer.</i>

02:58.387 --> 03:00.722
Any notes?

03:01.807 --> 03:04.059
Oliver would always
give me notes on my reads.

03:04.059 --> 03:05.477
Thought it was fine.

03:05.477 --> 03:08.689
Oh. Oliver would be
a little more, uh, snarky.

03:08.689 --> 03:11.400
Do you want me to... Oh, okay.

03:12.359 --> 03:13.610

w-we did not have time

04:40.739 --> 04:43.325
one piece of foam board,
but we do have champagne!

04:47.496 --> 04:49.498
Sadly, we're out of champagne.

04:52.751 --> 04:55.087
So, do you see it?

04:55.087 --> 04:57.130
All I see is a bunch of zeros
in my bank account.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.966
Yes, but what number's
in front of those zeros?

04:58.966 --> 05:00.717
Another zero.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.761
I've put a lot of money into this play,

05:02.761 --> 05:05.597
and musicals are <i>more</i> expensive.

05:05.597 --> 05:08.100
B-But look,
we're talking about <i>triplets</i> here!

05:08.767 --> 05:10.644
Do you see it, Cliff?
- I do.

05:10.644 --> 05:13.647
I love a musical.
- Sweetie. We've talked about your taste.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.190
Yes. It's bad.

05:15.190 --> 05:16.817
You need a showstopper.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.486
Right.
That's how musicals make money.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.655
A song so irresistible,

05:21.655 --> 05:24.283
it's like a syringe that
shoots from Broadway

05:24.283 --> 05:26.743
straight into the neck
of Debbie from Duluth,

05:26.743 --> 05:29.746
who becomes an addict
from the first second she hears it

05:29.746 --> 05:32.666
during girl's night out
at the Calorie Pit.

05:32.666 --> 05:35.919
And an addict will do anything,
anything, to get her fix,

05:35.919 --> 05:38.338
even take a middle seat on a red-eye

05:38.338 --> 05:41.842
to New York City,
where for the low, low price

05:41.842 --> 05:43.677
of everything she's got,

05:43.677 --> 05:45.387
Debbie can have the privilege of sitting

05:45.387 --> 05:48.682
in the finest rear balcony seat
in all the land

05:48.682 --> 05:50.809
to finally, finally see

05:50.809 --> 05:53.145
<i>that</i> show with <i>that</i> song

05:53.145 --> 05:56.607
she can't stop belting out
all over fucking Duluth.

05:57.107 --> 05:59.818
So, do you have anything that good?

05:59.818 --> 06:03.113
Do you have a showstopper?

06:03.113 --> 06:06.909
Darling, you are a maniac!
And I love you!

06:06.909 --> 06:09.536
This show is gonna be
nothing <i>but</i> showstoppers.

06:09.536 --> 06:12.623
This is Oliver Putnam we're talking about.

06:12.623 --> 06:13.665
Just gimme a few months--

06:13.665 --> 06:15.209
- You have three days.
- That's perfect.

06:15.209 --> 06:17.461
I was hoping you'd say three days.
- Then I leave for the Hamptons,

06:17.461 --> 06:19.004
and unless they have cell service

06:19.004 --> 06:21.882
at the bottom of a bottle of Chardonnay,

06:21.882 --> 06:23.258
I will not be reachable.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.428
You spent a few months with this group.

06:26.428 --> 06:28.055
Any first thoughts?

06:28.055 --> 06:31.016
First thoughts. First thoughts.
My first thought

06:31.016 --> 06:33.477
is maybe I should've
gotten to know them better.

06:33.477 --> 06:36.146
Wow. I was worried
we'd be starting at square one,

06:36.146 --> 06:38.232
but no danger of that.
- Well, you have to remember,

06:38.232 --> 06:39.691
a lot of them grew up idolizing me,

06:39.691 --> 06:41.777
so they keep their distance
out of respect.

06:41.777 --> 06:44.321
Sure. If that makes sense to you.

06:44.321 --> 06:47.533
Alright, let's start with opportunity.

06:47.533 --> 06:50.744
Everyone was at the Arconia
when Ben was pushed,

06:50.744 --> 06:53.288
and everyone was at the theater
when he collapsed.

06:53.288 --> 06:54.373
Could be a coincidence.

06:54.373 --> 06:57.835
No, coincidence is like meeting someone
who has the same birthday as you.

06:57.835 --> 07:01.129
Cops said his blood was clean,
but maybe it was one of those poisons

07:01.129 --> 07:02.798
that dissipates within five minutes.

07:02.798 --> 07:05.425
Like succinylcholine chloride!

07:05.968 --> 07:07.469
- Hm.
- What?

07:07.469 --> 07:10.764
Okay, so, uh, someone tried
to poison him, failed,

07:10.764 --> 07:12.933
and then finished the job at the Arconia.

07:12.933 --> 07:16.645
But who would wanna kill Ben
bad enough to kill him twice?

07:16.645 --> 07:18.605
Jonathan, the understudy?

07:18.605 --> 07:21.233
Was he looking for
his moment in the limelight?

07:21.233 --> 07:22.818
Hm. Donna and Cliff?

07:22.818 --> 07:25.904
Did they want to be rid
of their demanding lead?

07:25.904 --> 07:28.949
Kimber, the TikTok-addicted starlet.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.869
Did she do it as part of an internet <i>mem?</i>

07:32.870 --> 07:34.413
Why are you saying it like that?

07:34.413 --> 07:36.039
No, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.

07:36.039 --> 07:39.793
The night Ben died,
he apologized to Kimber

07:39.793 --> 07:42.337
for "making things messy."
Do you think they were hooking up?

07:42.337 --> 07:44.798
I don't know.
But another female killer?

07:44.798 --> 07:46.091
That's so done.

07:46.091 --> 07:47.467
The night that Ben died,

07:47.467 --> 07:50.470
he was holding
someone else's handkerchief.

07:51.305 --> 07:54.308
We need to find out who
in the cast doesn't have theirs!

07:55.017 --> 07:56.059
That could be our killer!

07:58.395 --> 08:01.315
It's Oliver. Rehearsal at his place now?

08:02.065 --> 08:03.901
Guess I have to go.
- I'll be right behind you.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.237
Wait, Oliver's texting me now.

08:07.237 --> 08:09.865
I am no longer welcome at his apartment.

08:09.865 --> 08:10.908
I am banned?

08:11.533 --> 08:13.827
No investigating during rehearsals?

08:13.827 --> 08:16.079
Whatever. I'm gonna go
check out Ben's penthouse.

08:16.079 --> 08:18.332
Lester said that Dickie was
gonna be cleaning it out soon.

08:18.332 --> 08:20.334
You find someone
who doesn't have a hankie.

08:20.334 --> 08:23.337
Find someone who doesn't have a hankie.
I can do that. That's no biggie.

08:23.337 --> 08:24.713
That's a smallie.

08:24.713 --> 08:26.924
That's a very small thing because--

08:29.510 --> 08:31.303
I say, "Hey, a thankie for a hankie."

08:31.929 --> 08:33.514
But I'm not gonna do that.

08:33.514 --> 08:36.350
I will find something int--
more interesting to get it.

08:36.350 --> 08:38.185
These are the pages?
Why aren't they in order?

08:38.185 --> 08:39.978
Well, they weren't numbered
when you sent them to me,

08:39.978 --> 08:41.772
and most of them are on old takeout menus.

08:41.772 --> 08:44.358
Oh, okay. So, the stuff written
on the appetizers page

08:44.358 --> 08:46.443
goes before the stuff
written on the main courses.

08:46.443 --> 08:48.070
Also, wh-where's Loretta?

08:48.070 --> 08:49.446
I left two messages. Nothing.

08:49.446 --> 08:51.782
Well, keep trying, please, Howard.

08:53.325 --> 08:55.452
This feels weird.
Why?

08:55.452 --> 08:57.788
Because this production
is littered with red flags,

08:57.788 --> 08:59.248
and we're in our director's apartment

08:59.248 --> 09:01.250
instead of an <i>actual</i> rehearsal studio?

09:01.250 --> 09:03.210
Oh, hey! Hey.

09:04.253 --> 09:06.380
Remember those hankies that Ben gave us?

09:06.380 --> 09:08.006
What if we each found ours

09:08.006 --> 09:10.259
and just showed them to each other?

09:10.259 --> 09:12.261
Or me? Show them to me.

09:12.261 --> 09:14.638
Sorry, we're all a little distracted

09:14.638 --> 09:17.599
with our leading man,
you know, being dead.

09:17.599 --> 09:20.102
Oh, yeah.
Well, that-- <i>that</i> makes sense

09:20.102 --> 09:23.438
because losing anybody is hard.
Well, not anyone.

09:23.438 --> 09:25.440
Not like a Hitler or a Stalin.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.484
Though, I would not want
to diminish the grief

09:27.484 --> 09:29.820
of Mrs. Stalin. And yes,

09:29.820 --> 09:32.114
I know she has a name.

09:32.114 --> 09:34.658
Uh... Oh, Nadezhda...

09:36.910 --> 09:40.205
Anyway, the point is Ben is dead!

09:40.205 --> 09:43.667
And I think it would be healing for us
to come up with a memorial.

09:43.667 --> 09:45.919
That's why I brought up
those hankies in the first place

09:45.919 --> 09:47.588
because wouldn't it be fun--

09:47.588 --> 09:50.048
Oh! Not fun, but good,

09:50.048 --> 09:51.800
to take what Ben gave us,

09:51.800 --> 09:56.096
<i>those</i> hankies,
and use them to create a...

09:57.181 --> 09:58.307
quilt.

09:58.307 --> 09:59.892
Or a quilt-type object?

10:01.018 --> 10:02.477
What were you saying about Hitler?

10:04.104 --> 10:05.898
Thank you, Howard.

10:05.898 --> 10:07.399
I said thank you, Howard!

10:09.318 --> 10:11.486
I sense a great deal
of sadness in this room.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.199
We've lost someone important.

10:15.199 --> 10:17.576
I remember when my mom passed.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.162
Some of you are probably thinking,

10:20.162 --> 10:23.332
"Isn't he too young to
have lost a parent?" I'm not.

10:23.874 --> 10:25.792
I lost her, and it wrecked me.

10:26.710 --> 10:27.961
Big time.

10:29.213 --> 10:31.757
But she kept teaching me from the beyond,

10:31.757 --> 10:33.592
my mommy girl.

10:33.592 --> 10:35.093
Do you know what she said?

10:35.093 --> 10:38.889
<i>"You can't let death
stop you from livin', kid."</i>

10:40.390 --> 10:41.892
Mama was a smoker.

10:42.309 --> 10:43.769
So, who's with me?

10:43.769 --> 10:46.605
Who wants to keep doing the play?

10:49.441 --> 10:52.152

13:58.964 --> 14:00.382

But, ironically, that might be
what makes it accessible.

tracking this incredible herd

Okay. So, there's this place,
the Okavango Delta.

19:51.358 --> 19:53.902
Three times a year, the basin floods,

19:53.902 --> 19:56.989
and thousands of animals,
I mean thousands,

19:56.989 --> 19:59.449
they all descend in one place.

19:59.449 --> 20:02.160
And I was there for weeks alone,

20:02.160 --> 20:03.912
just perched in a tree,

20:03.912 --> 20:07.624

in all of its intimate beauty.

20:08.500 --> 20:10.210

20:11.962 --> 20:15.674

and I see this baby elephant

20:20.971 --> 20:22.806

20:23.265 --> 20:27.019
And, you know, I'm up in a tree,
but I'm also at a crossroads

20:27.019 --> 20:29.855
because should I hop down
and save the elephant?

20:29.855 --> 20:31.857

20:31.857 --> 20:35.068

20:35.068 --> 20:36.904

it's tricky because you gotta--

20:36.904 --> 20:38.864

22:20.507 --> 22:22.301
Did it ever occur to Oliver

22:22.301 --> 22:25.596
that maybe the problem isn't us?
Maybe it's the material?

22:25.596 --> 22:27.806
- Yeah, Oliver's <i>bad</i>.
- Exactly. I mean,

22:27.806 --> 22:29.933
I don't get anyone's
intentions in this thing.

22:29.933 --> 22:30.893
Mm-mmm.

22:30.893 --> 22:34.271
Like, now there are crab men,
and they're breeding. But why?

22:34.271 --> 22:36.398
For me, it's the way that Oliver yells.

22:36.398 --> 22:39.401
Yeah! A-And what about his hair?
Who needs all that <i>hair?</i>

22:40.277 --> 22:41.987
N-No, I think we're fine with his hair.

22:41.987 --> 22:43.488
I like his hair.
I like hair.

22:43.488 --> 22:45.449
Hey, you know what I was just thinking?

22:45.449 --> 22:48.410
What if we took all of the hankies
that Ben gave us,

22:48.410 --> 22:50.579
and we threw them at Oliver's feet?

22:50.579 --> 22:52.122
That would make a statement!

22:53.165 --> 22:55.542
And then I would pick up
the hankies later for the quilt.

22:55.542 --> 22:57.252
- I'll bring my hankie tomorrow.
- Same.

22:57.252 --> 22:58.795
Me, too. Awesome.

22:58.795 --> 23:01.089
Because I would take them.
You know, I've...

23:01.590 --> 23:04.092
I've been kinda numb since Ben died.

23:05.260 --> 23:08.430
I-I keep wanting to feel something.

23:08.430 --> 23:10.432
You know, to cry, but...

23:11.058 --> 23:13.477
I can't.
- Are you on Xanax?

23:13.477 --> 23:14.561
No. Why? Do you have some?

23:14.561 --> 23:16.688
No.
Either way,

23:16.688 --> 23:19.525
we should totally demand
to go back to the straight play.

23:19.525 --> 23:24.279
This musical version of Oliver's
is disrespectful to Ben's memory, right?

23:24.279 --> 23:25.322
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

23:25.322 --> 23:28.659
So, Charles, you'll tell Oliver
we're not gonna do the musical, right?

23:28.659 --> 23:31.328
Yeah. We're not gonna do the mu--
We're not gonna do the musical?

23:31.328 --> 23:32.579
Great. You got it.

23:34.873 --> 23:36.166
Oh, I'll tell him.

23:40.462 --> 23:41.755
Everyone else is gone.

23:42.798 --> 23:46.301
Oh. I was just looking at the song ideas
you have sketched out

23:46.301 --> 23:49.012
on this Chinese food menu.

23:49.012 --> 23:50.305
Hm.

23:50.305 --> 23:53.684
I have to say,
your lyrics make me feel...

23:54.643 --> 23:56.019
hungry.

24:02.693 --> 24:04.778
Here we are again.

24:04.778 --> 24:07.155
At the piano.

24:09.157 --> 24:11.702
Like--
- Oh, I'm sorry. Yes. Um...

24:13.662 --> 24:16.498
This is not my best day as a director.

24:16.498 --> 24:17.916
That was...

24:17.916 --> 24:20.294
in 1988, when I got my Tony.

24:21.628 --> 24:23.338
Tony was a dog I owned.

24:23.338 --> 24:27.009
And yes, I-I did choose
that name to confuse people.

24:27.009 --> 24:29.928
I love how all of your stories

24:29.928 --> 24:33.015
always end miles from where you start.

24:33.015 --> 24:35.017
Ah. Thank you.

24:39.354 --> 24:41.356
What do I have to do...

24:42.149 --> 24:45.110
to get people to see what I see?

24:45.986 --> 24:47.196
Hm.

24:47.196 --> 24:48.697
Can you help me?

24:48.697 --> 24:50.199
No, I'm afraid not.

24:53.785 --> 24:55.287
What about this one?

24:56.246 --> 24:58.081
This one.
<i>- The Nanny's Lullaby.</i>

24:58.081 --> 24:59.708
- Yeah.
- Okay. No, I know it.

24:59.708 --> 25:02.711
♪ gentle piano melody playing ♪

25:15.265 --> 25:16.808
♪ frustrated discordant chords ♪

25:16.808 --> 25:18.060
- Oh, what?
- Nah.

25:18.060 --> 25:20.687
Come on. Oliver, that is good.

25:20.687 --> 25:23.941
I-I promised Donna "Oliver Putnam,"

25:23.941 --> 25:26.818
meaning big and loud and... big.

25:26.818 --> 25:28.904
Yeah, but I think we all know

25:28.904 --> 25:30.906
that you are more than just loud.

25:32.241 --> 25:34.284
What I love about...

25:35.244 --> 25:38.247
Oliver Putnam's shows is that

25:38.247 --> 25:42.209
underneath all the bombast
and the chaos and the...

25:43.293 --> 25:45.921
breeding crab men,

25:45.921 --> 25:48.090
it's just, there's a vulnerability.

25:49.258 --> 25:50.342
That's what makes...

25:53.345 --> 25:55.013
Oliver Putnam...

25:55.013 --> 25:56.723
special.

25:59.935 --> 26:01.812
A-As a director.

26:01.812 --> 26:04.231
Hello? The door was unlocked. Oh.

26:04.231 --> 26:05.649
Hi!
Oh good.

26:05.649 --> 26:07.150
I was hoping you'd still be here.

26:07.150 --> 26:09.444
- Yeah.
- You got the part.

26:10.279 --> 26:11.530
I what?

26:11.530 --> 26:13.073
<i>Grey's New Orleans Family Burn Unit.</i>

26:13.073 --> 26:15.325
They called. They love you.
- Oh no! Oh, Dickie!

26:15.325 --> 26:17.703
- I couldn't get 'em off the phone!
- Dickie!

26:17.703 --> 26:21.456
I'm the mom in the family
in <i>Family Burn Unit!</i>

26:21.456 --> 26:22.749
Oh, my God!

26:23.625 --> 26:26.420
And I get a limp! Oh!
- Oh.

26:26.420 --> 26:28.005
I can't believe it. Pinch me.

26:28.005 --> 26:29.965
I'll do you one better.
Congratulations!

26:29.965 --> 26:32.176
Oh, thank you!

26:32.176 --> 26:35.012
It starts next week in LA,
so we have to let 'em know right away.

26:35.012 --> 26:38.182
- We do.
- Wait, wait. Excuse me. I-I'm sorry.

26:38.182 --> 26:41.101
It sounds like a wonderful opportunity, but...

26:41.101 --> 26:44.021
she has to be here for the play next week.

26:44.021 --> 26:44.980
Yeah.

26:45.689 --> 26:48.108
Oh... Okay.

26:48.108 --> 26:49.985
Well, is there any flexibility
on their end?

26:49.985 --> 26:52.946
There's really not.
It's a guaranteed season pickup.

26:52.946 --> 26:55.824
That's stability, right?
No more scrounging for work?

26:55.824 --> 26:58.202
I know...

26:58.202 --> 27:00.913
Yeah, okay. So...

27:01.622 --> 27:03.624
Sure, then...

27:04.291 --> 27:05.334
Well, Oliver, I--

27:05.334 --> 27:08.337
You cannot be serious.
What about our show?

27:08.337 --> 27:10.422
- Yeah.
- What about the last few months?

27:10.422 --> 27:11.673
Well

27:11.673 --> 27:14.760
I will always cherish this time.

27:14.760 --> 27:17.346
- I discovered you.
- But, I-- Yes.

27:17.346 --> 27:19.556
That's not a reason to punish me.

27:20.349 --> 27:23.101
Oliver, you lost your leading man.

27:23.101 --> 27:26.021
You're trying to make this play

27:26.021 --> 27:27.981
into a musical

27:27.981 --> 27:30.484
that you wrote in--
- She's under contract.

27:34.696 --> 27:36.615
Oliver, I--

27:36.615 --> 27:38.784
You're under <i>contract</i>.

27:38.784 --> 27:40.244
Sorry.

27:49.753 --> 27:50.796
Fuck!

28:01.014 --> 28:03.600
You enjoying your morning <i>vetkeok?</i>

28:03.600 --> 28:05.435
I didn't feel you
swipe that drive from me.

28:05.435 --> 28:07.563
I gotta hand it to you, you got the touch.

28:09.439 --> 28:11.024
What's the password?

28:11.024 --> 28:14.111
I need to know what happened
right before Ben collapsed on stage.

28:14.111 --> 28:16.905
Well, you're in luck.
I'm making a movie about exactly that.

28:16.905 --> 28:18.282
I can probably get you a ticket.

28:18.282 --> 28:21.952
This isn't a joke. This is urgent.
I need to find who killed Ben.

28:21.952 --> 28:25.205
They know who did it.
The stalker guy in jail did it.

28:29.626 --> 28:33.547
You're not in Botswana anymore,
Robert with a T.

28:33.547 --> 28:35.799
This is where I do <i>my</i> work.

28:36.842 --> 28:37.926
And I'm really good at it,

28:37.926 --> 28:40.804
even if you think it's just cute.

28:44.808 --> 28:46.226
I didn't get out of that tree.

28:46.935 --> 28:48.604
The baby elephant thing. I lied.

28:48.604 --> 28:50.606
I didn't get out of the tree.

28:51.398 --> 28:55.277
I kept filming as it got more and more
tired, and more and more stuck.

28:57.446 --> 28:59.531
- God.
- Its mom came back, finally,

28:59.531 --> 29:01.533
and saved it, but...

29:02.159 --> 29:03.952
if she hadn't,
I would've kept filming.

29:04.828 --> 29:06.997
That elephant, that baby elephant

29:06.997 --> 29:09.291
slowly drowning in the mud.

29:09.291 --> 29:11.001
Jesus.

29:11.752 --> 29:14.463
Look, if you think Ben's
killer's still out there, then...

29:16.340 --> 29:18.133
I don't wanna stay in the tree again.

29:26.391 --> 29:27.392
Hi.

29:29.144 --> 29:30.604
Hi?

29:31.396 --> 29:33.190
Before I tell you what
I'm about to tell you,

29:33.190 --> 29:35.901
I need your assurance
that you will not be angry.

29:35.901 --> 29:37.152
No.

29:38.362 --> 29:40.239
No one wants to do the musical.

29:40.239 --> 29:41.490
Oh.

29:42.449 --> 29:43.450
No one?

29:43.450 --> 29:46.453
Well, the cast.
Most of the people who <i>would</i> do it,

29:46.453 --> 29:47.454
they don't wanna do it.

29:48.497 --> 29:49.748
Ah.

29:50.624 --> 29:52.334
They don't wanna do the musical.

29:53.836 --> 29:55.754
That's fine.

29:55.754 --> 29:57.130
Perhaps they'd rather I...

29:57.130 --> 29:59.800
take this spoon,
and stab myself in the eye with it!

29:59.800 --> 30:02.469
And just stab and stab!

30:02.469 --> 30:05.347
So I'll be too dead to be humiliated

30:05.347 --> 30:07.182
when Donna and Cliff get here,

30:07.182 --> 30:08.892
which is five minutes from now!

30:08.892 --> 30:10.936
I-I think they're just scared.

30:10.936 --> 30:13.647
They don't understand the show.
And I don't either,

30:13.647 --> 30:15.732
to be fair, but I come from television,

30:15.732 --> 30:18.318
and I was trained
not to question a script.

30:18.318 --> 30:20.863
I can't even afford the supplemental.

30:20.863 --> 30:22.656
So, how am I gonna get--

30:24.741 --> 30:26.493
You're here.

30:26.493 --> 30:29.663
Well, I <i>am</i> still under contract.

30:31.206 --> 30:33.208
Dickie, would you mind?
- Oh, sure.

30:34.626 --> 30:37.129
I am so, <i>so</i> sorry.

30:38.338 --> 30:39.381
I was horrible.

30:39.381 --> 30:41.091
And this is no excuse.

30:41.091 --> 30:43.635
I was just scared of losing you.

30:43.635 --> 30:46.180
Also, I haven't eaten for many weeks.

30:46.180 --> 30:49.892
You do know that you're holding
a spoonful of cream cheese.

30:52.644 --> 30:54.229
You're right. You're right.

30:54.229 --> 30:55.731
I'm a liar.

30:56.523 --> 31:00.235
But, you understand me, Loretta,
a-and that's been a rarity in my life.

31:00.235 --> 31:02.404
Why aren't we singing?

31:03.238 --> 31:05.365
I was hoping you would do me a favor.

31:05.365 --> 31:06.950
Just one, um,

31:06.950 --> 31:10.245
before you leave for LA
and take Hollywood by storm.

31:12.664 --> 31:15.375
I'm not gonna enforce the contract.

31:15.375 --> 31:18.170
I couldn't.
The world needs to see you.

31:22.007 --> 31:23.509
Well, what's the favor?

31:24.384 --> 31:25.928
Will you sing the lullaby?

31:26.845 --> 31:29.556
Wha-- The...
We haven't even rehearsed it,

31:29.556 --> 31:31.141
and there's no choreography.

31:31.141 --> 31:34.019
And, you know,
certainly not a showstopper.

31:34.019 --> 31:35.521
But it <i>is</i> the show.

31:36.772 --> 31:38.023
And you're the only one who sees it.

31:39.525 --> 31:41.360
Can you help them see too?

31:42.277 --> 31:44.655
I'll give it a shot.

31:44.655 --> 31:48.242
Let's get this over with because
I'm already "Amagansett sober."

31:48.242 --> 31:51.370
That's what Mom calls drunk.

31:51.370 --> 31:54.373
Ah, good.
Maybe she'll be more forgiving.

31:57.251 --> 32:00.045
Alright! Um, slight change of plans.

32:00.045 --> 32:02.506
Uh, we're not doing
<i>Creatures of the Night</i> anymore.

32:02.506 --> 32:04.550
But wasn't that your
opening showstopper?

32:04.550 --> 32:06.510
Yes, and it will be,

32:06.510 --> 32:09.555
but it's not yet, a-and that's my fault.

32:09.555 --> 32:10.806
I'm sorry.

32:11.723 --> 32:12.975
But I-I...

32:14.059 --> 32:15.894
do have something for you.

32:17.145 --> 32:18.564
And...

32:18.981 --> 32:21.358
I think it might hold
the heart of the show.

32:26.238 --> 32:30.033
Okay, let me set the scene.
It's late at the Pickwick Lighthouse.

32:30.033 --> 32:31.910
The triplets cry out in the night.

32:31.910 --> 32:34.204
Their mother has died,
but they're not alone.

32:35.664 --> 32:38.709
