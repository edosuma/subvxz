WEBVTT

00:09.917 --> 00:11.984
<i>That's it. Get it right to the top.</i>

00:12.086 --> 00:14.887
<i>Steady. Steady.</i>

00:49.691 --> 00:50.856
Up she goes.

00:50.958 --> 00:53.592
Hey, come on.
Put your back into it, huh?

00:54.862 --> 00:56.662
Here you are, son.

00:58.700 --> 01:02.535
- Oh, gentlemen, please.
- To my right.

01:02.637 --> 01:04.670
And you lot, come on.
Come on, get it moving.

01:04.772 --> 01:07.173
Come on, come on.

03:50.438 --> 03:54.373
In all my days I've never seen
a man swing an axe like that.

03:54.475 --> 03:57.977
How many men did it take
to cut you down?

03:58.079 --> 04:00.112
Just one.

04:00.214 --> 04:01.680
Ooh.

04:01.782 --> 04:04.049
He must have been
some kind of monster.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.386
He was a woman.

04:48.542 --> 04:51.830
I think some of the men
are a bit afraid of you.

04:51.933 --> 04:53.933
I'm used to it.

04:55.241 --> 04:57.875
When I found you, I thought
you'd been dead for days.

04:59.345 --> 05:01.011
The way you were stinking already

05:01.113 --> 05:02.813
and you had bugs all over you

05:02.915 --> 05:05.582
and bone was coming
through right there.

05:09.254 --> 05:11.303
I was gonna give you a proper
burial and then you coughed.

05:11.441 --> 05:13.742
Oh, nearly shit myself.

05:13.844 --> 05:15.544
<i>I reckoned you were gonna die</i>

05:15.646 --> 05:18.046
<i>by the time I loaded you
on the wagon, but you didn't.</i>

05:18.148 --> 05:21.216
Now, I reckoned you'd die a dozen
more times over the next few days,

05:21.318 --> 05:23.718
but you didn't.
What kept you going?

05:27.691 --> 05:29.257
Hate.

05:30.727 --> 05:33.428
No, there's a reason
you're still here.

05:33.530 --> 05:36.397
Aye, there's a reason. I'm a big
fucker and I'm tough to kill.

05:36.499 --> 05:38.967
No, a reason.

05:39.492 --> 05:41.625
Gods aren't done with you yet.

05:43.273 --> 05:45.340
I've heard that before.

05:45.442 --> 05:47.642
Man was talking about
a different god, though.

05:47.744 --> 05:49.877
Well, maybe he was right.

05:49.980 --> 05:51.579
I don't know much about the gods.

05:51.681 --> 05:53.982
You're in the wrong line of work.

05:54.084 --> 05:55.984
Oh, there's plenty
of pious sons of bitches

05:56.086 --> 05:58.586
who think they know
the word of god or gods.

05:58.688 --> 06:01.155
I don't. I don't even
know their real names.

06:01.257 --> 06:05.660
Maybe it is the Seven.
Or maybe it's the old gods.

06:05.762 --> 06:07.662
Or maybe it's the Lord of Light.

06:07.764 --> 06:10.498
Or maybe they're all
the same fucking thing.

06:10.600 --> 06:12.200
I don't know.

06:12.302 --> 06:14.302
What matters, I believe,

06:14.404 --> 06:17.405
is that there's something
greater than us.

06:17.507 --> 06:22.343
And whatever it is, it's got
plans for Sandor Clegane.

06:25.715 --> 06:28.349
You didn't know me back in my time.

06:30.086 --> 06:32.420
You don't know the things I've done.

06:34.090 --> 06:36.157
I've heard stories.

06:37.894 --> 06:40.228
If the gods are real...

06:42.165 --> 06:44.565
why haven't they punished me?

06:46.836 --> 06:48.603
They have.

07:03.253 --> 07:05.520
Your Grace.

07:05.622 --> 07:07.689
What are we reading today?

07:07.791 --> 07:10.358
The Book of the Mother,
Your Holiness.

07:10.460 --> 07:12.460
Chapter three, verse 12.

07:12.562 --> 07:16.698
Ah, "As water rounds
the stones, smoothing..."

07:16.800 --> 07:20.401
"Smoothing what was jagged,
so does a woman's love

07:20.503 --> 07:22.537
calm a man's brute nature."

07:22.639 --> 07:25.506
<i>"A wife salves her husband's wounds,</i>

07:25.608 --> 07:28.076
a mother sings her son to sleep."

07:28.178 --> 07:31.212
You learn quickly.

07:31.314 --> 07:35.249
There are some who know every
verse of the sacred text,

07:35.351 --> 07:38.352
but don't have a drop of the
Mother's mercy in their blood

07:38.455 --> 07:41.889
and savages who can't read at all

07:41.991 --> 07:44.726
who understand the Father's wisdom.

07:46.629 --> 07:49.764
For years I pretended

07:49.866 --> 07:51.999
to love the poor, the afflicted.

07:52.102 --> 07:56.504
I had pity for them,
but I never loved them.

07:56.606 --> 07:59.373
They disgusted me.

07:59.476 --> 08:01.709
They are hard to love.

08:01.811 --> 08:04.946
The poor disgust us
because they are us,

08:05.048 --> 08:07.381
shorn of our illusions.

08:07.484 --> 08:10.985
They show us what we'd look
like without our fine clothes.

08:11.087 --> 08:13.755
How'd we smell without perfume.

08:15.258 --> 08:18.893
Can I ask you
about a personal matter?

08:18.995 --> 08:20.661
Of course.

08:23.433 --> 08:26.834
The king mentioned
that since your reunion,

08:26.936 --> 08:29.137
you haven't joined him
in the marriage bed.

08:30.874 --> 08:31.874
No.

08:31.975 --> 08:34.808
You have a duty, Your Grace.

08:34.910 --> 08:38.312
To your husband,
your king, your country,

08:38.414 --> 08:40.748
to the gods themselves.

08:40.850 --> 08:42.950
It's just...

08:43.052 --> 08:47.288
the desires that once
drove me no longer do.

08:48.525 --> 08:51.092
Congress does not require desire

08:51.194 --> 08:55.463
on the woman's part, only patience.

08:55.565 --> 08:58.432
The king must have an heir

08:58.535 --> 09:01.169
if we are to continue our good work.

09:02.472 --> 09:03.938
Forgive me.

09:04.040 --> 09:06.674
Sometimes the true path
is hard to find.

09:06.776 --> 09:08.910
Hard to find

09:09.012 --> 09:11.913
and harder still to walk upon.

09:12.015 --> 09:14.482
But you've made great progress.

09:16.019 --> 09:19.387
I only pray your grandmother
follows your lead.

09:21.724 --> 09:23.291
My grandmother?

09:23.393 --> 09:24.792
Yes.

09:24.894 --> 09:28.129
The Queen of Thorns
is a remarkable woman,

09:28.231 --> 09:30.064
a strong woman,

09:30.166 --> 09:31.899
and an unrepentant sinner.

09:32.001 --> 09:34.869
<i>You must teach her the new way</i>

09:34.971 --> 09:36.604
<i>as she taught you the old.</i>

09:36.706 --> 09:39.707
Or I fear for her safety,

09:39.809 --> 09:41.442
body and soul.

09:46.783 --> 09:48.983
<i>Does it move or talk?</i>

09:49.085 --> 09:51.552
I want to speak with you alone.

09:51.654 --> 09:54.956
Septa Unella has been my
true friend and counselor.

09:55.058 --> 09:57.725
Oh, this is madness!

10:03.967 --> 10:06.634
You're not in your sanctuary
now, my dear.

10:06.736 --> 10:10.471
All I have to do is whistle and my men
will stroll in here and bash you about...

10:10.573 --> 10:12.673
- Grandmother.
- ...until I tell them to stop.

10:12.775 --> 10:15.176
If I tell them to stop.

10:15.278 --> 10:18.679
- You could use a good bashing.
- Grandmother, please.

10:18.781 --> 10:20.314
What have they done to you?

10:20.416 --> 10:22.216
You marched against the High Sparrow,

10:22.318 --> 10:24.218
- against the Faith.
- We marched for you.

10:24.320 --> 10:27.054
The gods could have punished you
and Father, but they didn't.

10:27.156 --> 10:29.156
- They showed mercy.
- And what about your brother?

10:29.225 --> 10:30.858
What mercy did they show him?

10:30.960 --> 10:34.829
Loras's only hope is to confess
his crimes and repent.

10:34.931 --> 10:38.032
If he does, the Faith will allow
him to return to Highgarden.

10:38.134 --> 10:40.368
He'll have to renounce
his name and title...

10:40.470 --> 10:43.237
- Have you lost your mind?
- ...and live his life as a penitent.

10:43.339 --> 10:46.874
He is the heir to Highgarden,
the future of House Tyrell.

10:46.976 --> 10:48.409
He can begin again.

10:48.511 --> 10:50.144
As a mindless fanatic.

10:50.246 --> 10:52.079
As a free man.

10:53.683 --> 10:55.716
You will leave for Highgarden today.

10:55.818 --> 10:59.520
There is no law that says
you must stay here.

10:59.622 --> 11:01.455
I am the queen.

11:01.557 --> 11:05.526
It is my duty to serve
my husband the king.

11:08.932 --> 11:11.432
But you should leave, Grandmother.

11:11.534 --> 11:13.534
Your place is at home.

11:13.636 --> 11:16.037
I will never leave you.
Never.

11:16.139 --> 11:17.838
You must.

11:19.609 --> 11:22.143
Go home.

11:22.245 --> 11:26.147
Find comfort in prayer
and good works.

11:28.851 --> 11:31.319
The Mother watches over us all.

11:37.994 --> 11:40.361
I'll see you soon, my dear.

11:45.935 --> 11:48.302
Seven blessings to you, Grandmother.

11:59.549 --> 12:01.582
Shall we pray?

12:18.768 --> 12:20.768
<i>We said we'd
fight with you, King Crow,</i>

12:20.870 --> 12:23.037
<i>when the time comes and we meant it,</i>

12:23.139 --> 12:24.905
but this isn't what we agreed to.

12:25.008 --> 12:26.540
<i>These aren't white walkers.</i>

12:26.642 --> 12:28.476
<i>This isn't an army of the dead.</i>

12:28.578 --> 12:31.912
This isn't our fight.

12:32.015 --> 12:34.882
<i>If it weren't for
him, none of us would be here.</i>

12:34.984 --> 12:38.252
All of you would be meat
in the Night King's army.

12:38.354 --> 12:41.655
And I'd be a pile of charred
bones just like Mance.

12:41.758 --> 12:43.958
Remember Mance's camp?

12:44.060 --> 12:46.627
<i>It stretched all the way to the horizon.</i>

12:46.729 --> 12:48.763
And look at us now.

12:48.865 --> 12:51.365
Look what's left of us.

12:51.467 --> 12:53.968
And if we lose this, we're gone.

12:54.070 --> 12:58.539
<i>Dozens of tribes,
hundreds of generations.</i>

12:58.641 --> 13:00.775
<i>Be like we were never there at all.</i>

13:00.877 --> 13:02.877
We'll be the last of the free folk.

13:04.814 --> 13:07.481
That's what'll happen
to you if we lose.

13:09.385 --> 13:12.053
The Boltons, the
Karstarks, the Umbers,

13:12.155 --> 13:13.854
they know you're here.

13:13.956 --> 13:16.857
They know that more than half
of you are women and children.

13:16.959 --> 13:19.593
After they finish with me,
they'll come for you.

13:19.695 --> 13:22.329
<i>You're right.</i>

13:22.432 --> 13:24.065
<i>This isn't your fight.</i>

13:24.167 --> 13:26.700
You shouldn't have to come
to Winterfell with me.

13:26.803 --> 13:28.302
I shouldn't be asking you.

13:28.404 --> 13:30.171
It's not the deal we made.

13:31.774 --> 13:34.141
I need you with me
if we're going to beat them,

13:34.243 --> 13:37.344
and we need to beat them
if you're going to survive.

13:41.818 --> 13:45.486
The crows killed him because
he spoke for the free folk

13:45.588 --> 13:47.588
when no other southerners would.

13:48.925 --> 13:51.358
He died for us.

13:51.461 --> 13:55.863
If we are not willing to do the
same for him, we're cowards.

13:57.166 --> 13:58.766
<i>And if that's what we are,</i>

13:58.868 --> 14:01.469
we deserve to be
the last of the free folk.

14:18.054 --> 14:20.054
Snow.

15:02.732 --> 15:04.665
Are you sure they'll come?

15:06.235 --> 15:08.602
We're not clever
like you southerners.

15:08.704 --> 15:12.106
When we say we'll do
something, we do it.

15:29.292 --> 15:31.458
I heard you were
leaving King's Landing.

15:32.628 --> 15:34.628
That is hardly your concern.

15:34.730 --> 15:37.598
Your grandson is still a prisoner.

15:37.700 --> 15:39.500
You'll leave him rotting in a cell?

15:39.602 --> 15:42.803
Loras rots in a cell because of you.

15:42.905 --> 15:46.407
The High Sparrow rules
this city because of you.

15:46.509 --> 15:50.844
Our two ancient houses
face collapse because of you

15:50.947 --> 15:52.880
and your stupidity.

15:54.350 --> 15:56.650
You're right.

15:56.752 --> 15:58.686
I made a terrible mistake.

15:58.788 --> 16:00.554
I carry it with me every single day.

16:00.656 --> 16:02.156
Good.

16:02.258 --> 16:05.793
I delivered an army of
fanatics onto our doorstep.

16:05.895 --> 16:08.062
And now we must fight them together.

16:10.333 --> 16:12.433
We need each other.

16:14.470 --> 16:17.838
I wonder if you're the worst
person I've ever met.

16:17.940 --> 16:20.741
At a certain age,
it's hard to recall.

16:20.843 --> 16:25.446
But the truly vile do stand
out through the years.

16:25.548 --> 16:27.715
<i>Do you remember the way
you smirked at me</i>

16:27.817 --> 16:31.652
<i>when my grandson and granddaughter
were dragged off to their cells?</i>

16:31.754 --> 16:34.521
I do.
I'll never forget it.

16:34.624 --> 16:36.357
You love your granddaughter.

16:37.560 --> 16:39.426
<i>I love my son.</i>

16:39.528 --> 16:42.930
It's the only truth I know.

16:43.032 --> 16:45.032
We must defend them.

16:45.134 --> 16:48.402
I'm leaving this wretched
city as fast as I can

16:48.504 --> 16:52.573
before that shoeless zealot
throws me into one of his cells.

16:52.675 --> 16:54.642
If you're half as bright
as you think you are,

16:54.744 --> 16:56.410
you'll find a way out of here, too.

16:56.512 --> 16:58.112
Never.

16:58.214 --> 16:59.613
I'll never leave my son.

16:59.715 --> 17:01.682
What'll you do, then?

17:01.784 --> 17:04.685
You have no support.
Not anymore.

17:04.787 --> 17:07.855
Your brother's gone.
The High Sparrow saw to that.

17:07.957 --> 17:10.891
<i>The rest of your family
have abandoned you.</i>

17:10.992 --> 17:12.859
<i>The people despise you.</i>

17:12.962 --> 17:15.429
You're surrounded by enemies,
thousands of them.

17:15.531 --> 17:17.498
You're going to kill them
all by yourself?

17:18.968 --> 17:20.567
<i>You've lost, Cersei.</i>

17:20.670 --> 17:24.704
It's the only joy I can
find in all this misery.

17:32.315 --> 17:34.748
<i>Pick the pace up.</i>

17:34.850 --> 17:36.317
<i>Keep going.</i>

17:40.222 --> 17:42.389
<i>Keep it moving!</i>

18:18.094 --> 18:20.361
Now, that is a sorry
attempt at a siege.

18:20.463 --> 18:24.098
Someone needs to teach those
sad twats how to dig trenches.

18:24.200 --> 18:27.067
Someone certainly does.

18:27.169 --> 18:29.787
Oh, no.
Not me.

18:29.889 --> 18:31.422
I'm just an upjumped sellsword.

18:31.524 --> 18:34.291
You're an anointed knight.
There's quite a difference.

18:34.393 --> 18:36.226
Aye, knights don't get paid.

18:36.328 --> 18:39.930
You have better instincts than any
officer in the Lannister army.

18:40.032 --> 18:44.101
That's like saying I have a bigger cock
than anyone in the Unsullied army.

18:45.638 --> 18:49.273
I expect to command all the
Lannister forces before long.

18:49.375 --> 18:51.408
You can be the right hand I lost.

18:55.147 --> 18:58.048
You promised me
a lordship and a castle

18:58.150 --> 19:00.117
and a highborn beauty for a wife.

19:00.219 --> 19:02.720
And you'll get all three.
A Lannister always...

19:02.822 --> 19:05.923
Don't say it.
Don't fucking say it.

19:23.743 --> 19:27.911
Come out and fight us, Blackfish.

19:28.013 --> 19:29.847
We have Lord Edmure.

19:31.517 --> 19:34.518
Yield the castle or we'll hang him.

19:53.439 --> 19:56.073
This is your last warning.

19:56.175 --> 19:58.041
Yield the castle.

20:10.022 --> 20:12.289
You think I won't do it, old man?

20:15.294 --> 20:17.795
I sliced your niece's
throat from ear to ear.

20:17.897 --> 20:21.832
And where were you?
Running and hiding like a fucking coward.

20:24.136 --> 20:28.472
Yield the castle or I cut his throat.

20:38.284 --> 20:41.251
Go on, then.
Cut his throat.

21:03.008 --> 21:05.509
Lothar, is it?

21:05.611 --> 21:07.811
Ser Jaime.

21:07.913 --> 21:09.479
We didn't know you were coming.

21:09.582 --> 21:11.248
'Cause you didn't set
a proper perimeter.

21:11.350 --> 21:14.184
You just allowed 8,000 men
to approach unchallenged.

21:14.286 --> 21:18.088
Good thing we're friends or we'd be
fucking you in the ass right now.

21:18.190 --> 21:20.090
Have Lord Edmure bathed and fed.

21:20.192 --> 21:22.259
Whoa, whoa.

21:22.361 --> 21:23.794
Walder.

21:25.898 --> 21:29.099
Edmure is a prisoner of House Frey.

21:31.003 --> 21:34.605
Only a fool makes threats he's
not prepared to carry out.

21:34.707 --> 21:37.474
Now let's say I threatened to hit you

21:37.576 --> 21:40.143
unless you shut your mouth,
but you kept talking.

21:40.246 --> 21:42.713
- What do you think I'd do?
- I don't give a rat's...

21:45.117 --> 21:47.484
I'm here by the king's command
to take back this castle.

21:47.586 --> 21:50.220
<i>Have him bathed and fed.</i>

21:50.322 --> 21:52.890
Unless you'd like to take his place.

21:54.226 --> 21:55.826
Apologies, Ser Jaime.

21:55.928 --> 21:57.227
Do as he says.

21:57.329 --> 21:59.730
The siege is now under my command.

21:59.832 --> 22:02.432
The next time the Blackfish
looks out from those ramparts,

22:02.534 --> 22:05.569
he'll see an army at his
gates, not whatever this is.

22:05.671 --> 22:07.838
<i>Have your lads start
digging perimeter trenches.</i>

22:07.940 --> 22:09.439
Set pickets every hundred yards.

22:09.541 --> 22:12.075
And work double-time on those
siege towers and trebuchets.

22:12.177 --> 22:13.510
Those are our siege towers...

22:13.612 --> 22:16.079
As I said, the siege
is under my command.

22:16.181 --> 22:18.749
<i>If that's not to your liking, go home.</i>

22:24.857 --> 22:27.057
Get word to the Blackfish.

22:27.159 --> 22:29.026
I want a parley.

22:29.128 --> 22:31.028
A parley or a fight?

22:32.164 --> 22:34.064
He's an old man.

22:34.166 --> 22:35.933
You've got one hand.

22:36.035 --> 22:38.135
My money's on the old boy.

22:57.623 --> 22:59.489
Lady Mormont.

22:59.591 --> 23:02.359
Welcome to Bear Island.

23:09.501 --> 23:11.668
I remember when
you were born, my lady.

23:11.770 --> 23:13.503
<i>You were named for my Aunt Lyanna.</i>

23:13.605 --> 23:16.340
It was said she was a great beauty.
I'm sure you will be, too.

23:16.442 --> 23:18.775
I doubt it. My mother
wasn't a great beauty

23:18.877 --> 23:20.143
or any other kind of beauty.

23:20.245 --> 23:22.412
<i>She was a great warrior, though.</i>

23:22.514 --> 23:24.848
She died fighting
for your brother Robb.

23:28.187 --> 23:31.688
I served under your uncle
at Castle Black, Lady Lyanna.

23:31.790 --> 23:34.858
He was also a great warrior
and an honorable man.

23:34.960 --> 23:36.593
I was his steward.
In fact...

23:36.695 --> 23:39.863
I think we've had enough small talk.
Why are you here?

23:42.267 --> 23:45.035
Stannis Baratheon
garrisoned at Castle Black

23:45.137 --> 23:47.637
<i>before he marched on
Winterfell and was killed.</i>

23:47.740 --> 23:50.540
He showed me the letter you wrote
to him when he petitioned for men.

23:50.642 --> 23:52.542
- It said...
- I remember what it said.

23:52.644 --> 23:54.144
Bear Island knows no king

23:54.246 --> 23:56.913
but the King in the North
whose name is Stark.

23:59.451 --> 24:01.385
Robb is gone,

24:01.487 --> 24:03.020
but House Stark is not.

24:03.122 --> 24:06.289
<i>And it needs your support
now more than ever.</i>

24:06.392 --> 24:10.460
I've come with my sister to ask
for House Mormont's allegiance.

24:21.573 --> 24:23.540
As far as I understand, you're a Snow

24:23.642 --> 24:25.442
and Lady Sansa is a Bolton.

24:25.544 --> 24:27.611
Or is she a Lannister?

24:27.713 --> 24:29.980
I've heard conflicting reports.

24:30.082 --> 24:33.050
I did what I had to do
to survive, my lady.

24:33.152 --> 24:35.919
But I am a Stark.
I will always be a Stark.

24:36.021 --> 24:38.522
If you say so.
In any case,

24:38.624 --> 24:41.491
you don't just want my allegiance.
You want my fighting men.

24:41.593 --> 24:44.494
Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed
to keep Winterfell, my lady.

24:44.596 --> 24:46.363
<i>It is our duty to stop him.</i>

24:46.465 --> 24:50.767
Even more so because he holds our
brother Rickon Stark as prisoner.

24:53.105 --> 24:55.005
What you have to understand,
my lady, is that...

24:55.107 --> 24:58.942
I understand that I'm responsible for
Bear Island and all who live here.

24:59.044 --> 25:03.580
So why should I sacrifice one more
Mormont life for someone else's war?

25:09.421 --> 25:12.689
If it please, my lady,

25:12.791 --> 25:14.391
I understand how you feel.

25:14.493 --> 25:16.927
I don't know you, Ser...?

25:17.029 --> 25:19.029
Davos, my lady, of House Seaworth.

25:19.131 --> 25:21.731
<i>You needn't ask your
maester about my house.</i>

25:21.834 --> 25:24.167
It's rather new.

25:25.671 --> 25:28.238
All right, Ser Davos of House Seaworth.

25:28.340 --> 25:30.307
How is it you understand how I feel?

25:30.409 --> 25:35.145
You never thought you'd find
yourself in your position.

25:35.247 --> 25:38.782
Being responsible for so many
lives at such a young age.

25:38.884 --> 25:40.650
<i>I never thought
I'd be in my position.</i>

25:40.752 --> 25:44.888
I was a crabber's son,
then I was a smuggler.

25:44.990 --> 25:47.057
And now I find myself
addressing the lady

25:47.159 --> 25:49.326
of a great house in time of war.

25:49.428 --> 25:53.630
But I'm here because this
isn't someone else's war.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.900
It's our war.

25:58.203 --> 25:59.970
Go on, Ser Davos.

26:01.807 --> 26:04.341
Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont,

26:04.443 --> 26:06.343
made that man his steward.

26:06.445 --> 26:09.246
He chose Jon to be his
successor because he knew

26:09.348 --> 26:11.348
he had the courage
to do what was right,

26:11.450 --> 26:14.384
<i>even if it meant giving his life.</i>

26:14.486 --> 26:18.421
Because Jeor Mormont
and Jon Snow both understood

26:18.524 --> 26:22.859
that the real war isn't between
a few squabbling houses.

26:22.961 --> 26:25.428
It's between the living and the dead.

26:26.832 --> 26:29.499
And make no mistake, my lady,

26:29.601 --> 26:31.568
the dead are coming.

26:33.238 --> 26:34.905
Is this true?

26:36.975 --> 26:39.609
Your uncle fought them
at the Fist of the First Men.

26:39.711 --> 26:41.411
<i>I fought them at Hardhome.</i>

26:41.513 --> 26:43.446
We both lost.

26:45.083 --> 26:48.652
As long as the Boltons hold
Winterfell, the North is divided.

26:48.754 --> 26:52.556
And a divided North won't stand a
chance against the Night King.

26:54.159 --> 26:57.194
You want to protect your people, my lady.
I understand.

26:57.296 --> 26:59.196
<i>But there's no hiding from this.</i>

26:59.298 --> 27:03.300
We have to fight and we
need to do it together.

27:13.612 --> 27:17.981
House Mormont has kept faith with
House Stark for 1,000 years.

27:21.019 --> 27:23.386
We will not break faith today.

27:28.126 --> 27:30.260
Thank you, my lady.

27:30.362 --> 27:33.563
How many fighting men can we expect?

27:40.105 --> 27:41.504
62.

27:45.110 --> 27:47.744
- 62?
- <i>We are not a large house,</i>

27:47.846 --> 27:49.179
<i>but we're a proud one.</i>

27:49.281 --> 27:51.014
And every man from Bear Island

27:51.116 --> 27:53.483
fights with the strength
of 10 mainlanders.

27:53.585 --> 27:57.153
If they're half
as ferocious as their lady,

27:57.256 --> 27:59.489
the Boltons are doomed.

29:15.400 --> 29:17.033
Kingslayer.

29:18.337 --> 29:19.936
Blackfish.

29:20.038 --> 29:22.005
I assume you're here

29:22.107 --> 29:24.507
to fulfill the vow you gave my niece.

29:24.609 --> 29:27.911
I don't see Sansa and Arya.

29:28.013 --> 29:30.780
- I don't have them.
- Pity.

29:30.882 --> 29:33.717
Do you wish to resume your captivity?

29:35.087 --> 29:36.353
Then why are you here?

29:36.455 --> 29:38.188
You know why I'm here.

29:38.290 --> 29:40.123
This castle belongs to House Frey.

29:40.225 --> 29:41.758
You're trespassing.

29:41.860 --> 29:44.627
In the name of King Tommen,
I order you to surrender or...

29:44.730 --> 29:48.198
Or you'll kill Edmure?

29:48.300 --> 29:51.034
My nephew's marked
for death no matter what.

29:51.136 --> 29:52.569
Hang him and be done with it.

29:52.671 --> 29:54.337
It won't stop with Edmure.

29:54.439 --> 29:56.473
You'll force me to storm the castle.

29:56.575 --> 29:58.375
Hundreds will die.

29:58.477 --> 30:01.878
Hundreds of mine.
Thousands of yours.

30:01.980 --> 30:04.547
If you can breach the walls.

30:04.649 --> 30:08.651
We'll breach them and kill
every last one of you.

30:10.088 --> 30:12.322
But if you surrender,

30:12.424 --> 30:14.657
I'll spare the lives of your men.

30:14.760 --> 30:16.426
On my honor.

30:16.528 --> 30:18.128
Your honor?

30:18.230 --> 30:21.464
Bargaining with oathbreakers
is like building on quicksand.

30:21.566 --> 30:23.366
The war is over, ser.

30:23.468 --> 30:26.136
Why sacrifice living men
to a lost cause?

30:31.376 --> 30:35.945
As long as I'm standing,
the war is not over.

30:37.115 --> 30:38.982
This is my home.

30:39.084 --> 30:42.952
I was born in this castle
and I'm ready to die in it.

30:43.054 --> 30:45.922
So you can either attack

30:46.024 --> 30:48.725
or try to starve us out.

30:48.827 --> 30:51.594
We have enough provisions
for two years.

30:53.331 --> 30:57.133
Do you have two years, Kingslayer?

31:02.107 --> 31:05.341
You clearly have no intention
of saving your men's lives.

31:05.444 --> 31:07.177
Why did you come treat with me?

31:08.547 --> 31:10.580
Sieges are dull.

31:10.682 --> 31:14.150
And I wanted to see you in
person, get the measure of you.

31:15.520 --> 31:16.786
Well, now you have.

31:16.888 --> 31:18.922
Aye, now I have.

31:19.024 --> 31:21.491
I'm disappointed.

31:30.836 --> 31:32.836
<i>The answer is no.</i>

31:32.938 --> 31:36.072
- Lord Glover, if you could just hear us out.
- I've heard enough.

31:36.174 --> 31:38.875
We've only just taken back
this castle from the ironborn.

31:38.977 --> 31:40.977
The Boltons helped us do it.

31:41.079 --> 31:42.912
Now you want me
to fight against them?

31:43.014 --> 31:44.981
I could be skinned
for even talking to you.

31:45.083 --> 31:47.350
The Boltons are traitors.
Roose Bolton...

31:47.452 --> 31:50.520
Have other northern houses
pledged to fight for you?

31:50.622 --> 31:53.490
House Mormont.

31:53.592 --> 31:55.525
And?

31:55.627 --> 31:58.027
We sent ravens to Houses Manderly...

31:58.129 --> 32:00.964
I don't care about ravens.

32:01.066 --> 32:03.333
You're asking me to join your army.

32:03.435 --> 32:06.769
Who is fighting in this army?

32:12.043 --> 32:14.644
The bulk of the force
is made up of wildlings.

32:17.048 --> 32:19.682
Then the rumors are true.

32:21.353 --> 32:23.453
I didn't dare believe them.

32:26.992 --> 32:30.226
I received you out of
respect for your father.

32:30.328 --> 32:32.262
Now I would like you to leave.

32:32.364 --> 32:35.665
House Glover will not
abandon its ancestral home

32:35.767 --> 32:38.401
to fight alongside wildlings.

32:40.171 --> 32:42.171
- Lord Glover.
- There's nothing else to say.

32:42.274 --> 32:44.340
I would remind you that House Glover

32:44.442 --> 32:46.442
is pledged to House Stark.

32:46.545 --> 32:49.445
Sworn to answer when called upon.

32:59.491 --> 33:03.626
Yes, my family served
House Stark for centuries.

33:03.728 --> 33:06.529
We wept when we heard
of your father's death.

33:06.631 --> 33:11.100
When my brother was lord of this
castle, he answered Robb's call

33:11.202 --> 33:13.336
and hailed him King in the North.

33:18.376 --> 33:20.610
And where was King Robb

33:20.712 --> 33:23.880
when the ironborn
attacked this castle?

33:23.982 --> 33:27.617
When they threw my wife
and children in prison

33:27.719 --> 33:31.454
and brutalized
and killed our subjects?

33:31.556 --> 33:35.391
Taking up with a foreign whore.

33:35.493 --> 33:39.362
Getting himself and those
who followed him killed.

33:44.369 --> 33:46.569
I served House Stark once,

33:46.671 --> 33:49.606
but House Stark is dead.

34:47.431 --> 34:49.599
Why did we have to come here?

34:49.701 --> 34:52.068
Some of us still like it.

34:56.641 --> 34:58.307
Have a drink at least.

34:58.410 --> 34:59.709
I don't want one.

35:01.046 --> 35:04.614
Don't go far, love.

35:04.716 --> 35:06.783
I'll find you in a bit.

35:11.823 --> 35:15.191
Nothing on the Iron Islands
has an ass like that.

35:15.293 --> 35:17.894
Doesn't interest you anymore?

35:20.732 --> 35:23.966
I'm sorry.
I won't joke about it.

35:25.837 --> 35:27.503
I'll never hurt you, little brother.

35:27.605 --> 35:29.238
Don't you know that?

35:33.311 --> 35:35.311
You think Uncle Euron's
hunting for us?

35:35.413 --> 35:38.948
Of course he is. As long as
we're alive, we're a threat.

35:39.050 --> 35:40.683
He'll find us.

35:40.785 --> 35:43.486
It's a great big world
and we have fast ships.

35:43.588 --> 35:45.021
Drink.

35:45.123 --> 35:46.522
I don't want any.

35:46.624 --> 35:48.591
I don't care what you want. Drink.

35:52.063 --> 35:53.663
Drink it all.

35:56.234 --> 35:59.569
You're ironborn, Theon. I know
you've had some bad years.

35:59.671 --> 36:01.070
Some bad years?

36:01.172 --> 36:04.273
But I'm tired of watching
you cower like a beat dog.

36:04.375 --> 36:06.642
Drink the goddamn ale.

36:10.615 --> 36:12.682
Now listen to me.

36:12.784 --> 36:14.117
I need you.

36:14.219 --> 36:17.754
The real Theon Greyjoy,
not this rat shit pretender.

36:17.856 --> 36:19.622
Can you find him for me?

36:20.992 --> 36:22.492
Drink.

36:24.462 --> 36:25.995
You escaped.
You hear me?

36:26.097 --> 36:28.631
You got away and you're
never going back.

36:28.733 --> 36:30.700
We'll get justice for you.

36:30.802 --> 36:33.436
If I got justice, my burnt body would
hang over the gates of Winterfell.

36:33.538 --> 36:35.938
Fuck justice, then.
We'll get revenge. Drink.

36:40.912 --> 36:42.912
Listen to me.

36:43.014 --> 36:46.048
If you're so broken
that there's no coming back,

36:46.151 --> 36:48.384
take a knife and cut your wrists.

36:49.721 --> 36:51.888
End it.

36:51.990 --> 36:55.858
But if you're staying,
Theon, I need you.

36:55.960 --> 36:58.361
We're gonna sail to Meereen.

36:58.463 --> 37:01.931
We're gonna make a pact
with this Dragon Queen.

37:02.033 --> 37:04.834
And we're gonna take back
the Iron Islands.

37:07.605 --> 37:09.539
Are you with me?

37:10.675 --> 37:12.809
Are you really with me?

37:30.628 --> 37:34.263
Now, since it's my last night
ashore for a long while,

37:34.365 --> 37:36.399
I'm gonna go fuck
the tits off this one.

37:48.379 --> 37:51.781
Stannis camped here
on his way to Winterfell.

37:51.883 --> 37:54.217
And that's a good thing?

37:54.319 --> 37:57.053
He was the most experienced
commander in Westeros.

37:57.155 --> 37:59.822
He chose this place for a reason.

37:59.924 --> 38:02.325
Those mountains are
a natural fortification.

38:02.427 --> 38:04.160
There's a stream
down there for the horses.

38:04.262 --> 38:06.095
We're not staying here long.

38:06.197 --> 38:07.997
Another storm could hit any day.

38:08.099 --> 38:10.733
Aye, the snows defeated Stannis

38:10.835 --> 38:12.768
as much as the Boltons did.

38:12.871 --> 38:16.839
We have to march on Winterfell
now while we still can.

38:16.941 --> 38:19.075
2,000 wildlings,

38:19.177 --> 38:22.078
200 Hornwoods, 143 Mazins...

38:22.180 --> 38:24.347
62 Mormonts.

38:24.449 --> 38:26.382
It's not what we'd hoped for.

38:28.119 --> 38:31.754
But we still have a chance
if we're careful and smart.

38:34.058 --> 38:36.125
For fuck's sake.

38:38.663 --> 38:41.831
So he's your most
trusted advisor now?

38:41.933 --> 38:45.134
Because he secured 62 men
from a 10-year-old?

38:45.236 --> 38:47.837
Ser Davos is the reason I'm
standing here talking to you

38:47.939 --> 38:50.106
and he served Stannis for years.

38:50.208 --> 38:52.842
Stannis who lost the Blackwater,

38:52.944 --> 38:56.345
who murdered his own brother,
who doesn't have a head?

38:56.447 --> 39:00.116
It's not enough.
We need more men.

39:00.218 --> 39:01.984
There's no time.

39:02.086 --> 39:04.487
If we went down to Castle
Cerwyn, I know that Lord...

39:04.589 --> 39:06.722
We fight with the army we have.

39:09.494 --> 39:12.028
Friends, this is not
worth fighting over!

39:14.198 --> 39:15.531
<i>This'll be it, now.</i>

39:15.633 --> 39:18.167
Right, now we don't need
to be fighting...

39:18.269 --> 39:19.835
- Who the fuck are you?
- Hold on.

39:19.938 --> 39:21.671
<i>Yeah, who the fuck are you?</i>

40:06.184 --> 40:08.384
<i>I was a soldier once.</i>

40:08.486 --> 40:11.454
<i>All my superiors thought I was brave.</i>

40:11.556 --> 40:14.623
<i>I wasn't. I mean, I
never ran from a fight.</i>

40:14.726 --> 40:18.260
Only because I was afraid my
friends would see I was afraid.

40:18.363 --> 40:20.262
That's all I was, a coward.

40:20.365 --> 40:24.233
We followed orders
no matter the orders.

40:24.335 --> 40:26.869
<i>Burn that village.</i>

40:26.971 --> 40:29.305
Fine, I'm your arsonist.

40:29.407 --> 40:32.074
Steal that farmer's crops.
Good, I'm your thief.

40:32.176 --> 40:35.878
Kill those young lads so they
won't take up arms against us.

40:37.482 --> 40:38.948
I'm your murderer.

40:40.318 --> 40:43.219
I remember once
a woman screaming at us,

40:43.321 --> 40:47.790
calling us animals as we dragged
her son from their hut.

40:47.892 --> 40:50.059
But we weren't animals.

40:50.161 --> 40:52.661
Animals are true to their nature

40:52.764 --> 40:55.097
and we had betrayed ours.

40:57.602 --> 41:00.536
I cut that young boy's throat myself

41:00.638 --> 41:02.538
as his mother screamed

41:02.640 --> 41:04.573
and my friends held her back.

41:08.212 --> 41:09.478
That night...

41:11.916 --> 41:13.816
I felt such shame.

41:15.153 --> 41:16.819
Shame was so heavy on me,

41:16.921 --> 41:20.356
I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep.

41:20.458 --> 41:23.225
All I could do was stare
into that dark sky

41:23.327 --> 41:26.829
and listen to that mother
screaming her son's name.

41:32.503 --> 41:35.237
I'll hear her screaming
the rest of my life.

41:39.277 --> 41:41.477
Now, I know I can never
bring that lad back.

41:41.579 --> 41:43.913
All I can do with time I've got left

41:44.015 --> 41:46.348
is bring a little
goodness into the world.

41:46.451 --> 41:48.517
That's all any of us
can do, isn't it?

41:48.619 --> 41:51.187
Never too late
to stop robbing people,

41:51.289 --> 41:53.122
<i>to stop killing people.</i>

41:53.224 --> 41:56.092
Start helping people.

41:56.194 --> 41:58.694
It's never too late to come back.

42:12.610 --> 42:16.512
And it's not about waiting for
the gods to answer your prayers.

42:16.614 --> 42:19.982
It's not even about the gods.
It's about you.

42:20.084 --> 42:23.352
Learning you have to answer
your prayers yourself.

42:26.257 --> 42:28.891
Seven save you, friends.

42:30.228 --> 42:31.794
<i>How can we help you?</i>

42:34.732 --> 42:36.832
What are you doing here?

42:36.934 --> 42:39.802
Well, we're talking about life.

42:39.904 --> 42:40.904
You?

42:41.005 --> 42:42.771
Protecting the people.

42:42.874 --> 42:46.442
<i>Well, we thank you
for your protection.</i>

42:46.544 --> 42:48.777
<i>Who are you protecting us from?</i>

42:51.182 --> 42:52.915
Do you have any horses?

42:53.017 --> 42:54.850
No horses.

42:54.952 --> 42:57.987
<i>No gold. No steel.</i>

42:58.089 --> 43:01.724
Food, then. Protecting the
people is hungry work.

43:01.826 --> 43:03.926
I'm sure it is.

43:04.028 --> 43:05.427
You're welcome to stay for supper,

43:05.530 --> 43:08.097
<i>but we have hungry mouths here.</i>

43:15.706 --> 43:17.907
Stay safe.

43:18.009 --> 43:20.042
The night is dark
and full of terrors.

43:43.901 --> 43:46.936
"Seven save you, friends."

43:47.038 --> 43:49.505
I'm a fucking septon.
What was I supposed to say?

43:49.607 --> 43:51.373
They don't believe in your Seven.

43:51.475 --> 43:53.776
They're from the Brotherhood.
They follow the Red God.

43:53.878 --> 43:56.011
Aye, well, all are welcome here.

43:56.113 --> 43:57.880
Anyway, we got nothing for them.

43:57.982 --> 43:59.515
Sure, you do.
You've got food,

43:59.617 --> 44:02.184
you've got steel even
if you say you don't.

44:02.286 --> 44:03.652
And you've got women.

44:03.754 --> 44:06.422
What do you want to do?
Fight them?

44:06.524 --> 44:08.290
Kill them?

44:08.392 --> 44:09.858
It'd be you against all of them.

44:09.961 --> 44:12.428
I mean, these people
don't know how to fight.

44:12.530 --> 44:13.729
You do.

44:13.831 --> 44:16.465
I'm done with fighting.

44:16.567 --> 44:18.567
Even if it's to protect yourself?

44:18.669 --> 44:21.237
Violence is a disease.

44:21.339 --> 44:24.506
You don't cure a disease by
spreading it to more people.

44:25.876 --> 44:27.977
You don't cure it by dying, either.

44:30.114 --> 44:31.647
You've done enough work for one day.

44:31.749 --> 44:34.450
Come on up for some supper.

44:34.552 --> 44:36.752
It's gonna be a cold night.

44:36.854 --> 44:38.854
We'll need firewood.

44:38.956 --> 44:41.390
I'll save you a bowl of stew.

44:41.492 --> 44:43.492
Might even have some ale hidden away.

44:52.069 --> 44:53.736
He's not a lying man.

44:53.838 --> 44:56.005
He says the Iron Fleet's
in Slaver's Bay.

44:56.107 --> 44:57.706
I'm inclined to believe him.

44:57.808 --> 45:00.576
I'm not going anywhere
near those mad fuckers.

45:00.678 --> 45:02.611
You're Westerosi.

45:02.713 --> 45:04.146
What do you care?

45:04.248 --> 45:06.248
I want to book passage home.

45:06.350 --> 45:09.418
You? Can't afford it.

45:16.627 --> 45:18.427
Where'd you steal this from?

45:18.529 --> 45:20.496
Why do you care?

45:20.598 --> 45:22.865
We leave in two days.

45:22.967 --> 45:24.667
You can have a hammock in steerage.

45:27.305 --> 45:28.637
<i>I want a cabin.</i>

45:28.739 --> 45:30.673
And we'll leave at dawn.

45:32.076 --> 45:33.809
See you at sunrise.

45:54.332 --> 45:56.231
Sweet girl.
