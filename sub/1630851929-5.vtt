00:03.586 --> 00:06.006
<i>Previously on
New Blood...</i>

00:06.047 --> 00:07.674
<i>[Angela]</i> <i>All I know is,
there are multiple injuries,</i>

00:07.716 --> 00:09.676
<i>and Harrison is involved.</i>

00:09.718 --> 00:11.678
<i>She said you told her
something about a</i>

00:11.720 --> 00:13.263
<i>proposed school shooting.</i>

00:13.304 --> 00:15.515
<i>Angela. I think you need
to take a look at this.</i>

00:15.557 --> 00:17.100
<i>It's a kill list.</i>

00:17.142 --> 00:18.184
<i>[Dexter]</i> <i>The stab wound
doesn't match</i>

00:18.226 --> 00:19.019
<i>the story he told Angela.</i>

00:19.060 --> 00:21.146
<i>Something's off.</i>

00:21.187 --> 00:25.483
<i>[Molly]</i> <i>She has a young baby
who is in the fucking room</i>

00:25.525 --> 00:27.152
<i>when she dies.</i>

00:27.193 --> 00:29.029
<i>How fucked-up is that kid now?
Am I right?</i>

00:29.070 --> 00:31.156
<i>Yeah, I just want to give
a shout-out to Harrison</i>

00:31.197 --> 00:33.825
<i>-for saving all our asses.</i>

00:33.867 --> 00:36.536
<i>Hey, stud. I, uh,
got you a little something</i>

00:36.578 --> 00:38.705
<i>-for keeping our town safe.</i>

00:38.747 --> 00:41.207
<i>Wow, that's some, like, real
Carrie from</i> <i>Homeland</i> <i>shit.</i>

00:41.249 --> 00:42.542
<i>-He just stabbed me.
- I know.</i>

00:42.584 --> 00:44.544
<i>Then why are you
interrogating me?</i>

00:44.586 --> 00:46.171
<i>[Molly]</i> <i>Do you think that he
attacked someone in the woods,</i>

00:46.212 --> 00:47.380
<i>or do you think his dad
is covering for him?</i>

00:47.422 --> 00:49.507
<i>I just need bus fare.</i>

00:50.216 --> 00:52.927
<i>Matt is staying at a hotel
in New York. Run his cards.</i>

00:52.969 --> 00:55.305
<i>[Harrison]</i> <i>Maybe we're a little
bit hero and a little bit...</i>

00:55.346 --> 00:57.891
<i>-...I don't know, monster.</i>

00:57.932 --> 00:59.934
<i>-Ethan's telling the truth.</i>

00:59.976 --> 01:02.729
<i>This wound wasn't made
by a hunting knife.</i>

01:02.771 --> 01:05.482
<i>Harrison brought his own weapon
to school that day.</i>

01:05.523 --> 01:07.942
<i>He has my Dark Passenger.</i>

01:18.203 --> 01:20.163
<i>ominous music</i>

01:31.299 --> 01:33.134
<i>Do you think he remembers?</i>

01:33.176 --> 01:36.763
<i>-He can't.
- You did.</i>

01:36.805 --> 01:39.224
<i>When asshole drug dealers
with chain saws</i>

01:39.265 --> 01:42.268
<i>dismembered your mother
inside a shipping container</i>

01:42.310 --> 01:44.771
<i>while you sloshed around
in her blood.</i>

01:44.813 --> 01:47.148
<i>-You remembered.
- That was different.</i>

01:47.190 --> 01:50.443
<i>He's your child, Dexter.
He's of your flesh and blood.</i>

01:50.485 --> 01:52.112
<i>I want to help him
the right way.</i>

01:52.153 --> 01:54.114
<i>Whatever it takes
to keep him from--</i>

01:54.155 --> 01:55.448
<i>Becoming me?</i>

01:55.490 --> 01:58.284
<i>What Harry did to you
was child abuse.</i>

01:58.326 --> 02:00.787
<i>Teaching you to become
a serial killer,</i>

02:00.829 --> 02:03.456
<i>and how to get away with it?</i>

02:03.498 --> 02:05.542
<i>Look where the fuck
that got us.</i>

02:05.583 --> 02:09.212
<i>If anyone can guide him
through this, it's me.</i>

02:09.254 --> 02:11.798
<i>Maybe that's why he found me.
Maybe that's why he's here.</i>

02:11.840 --> 02:13.967
<i>You cannot tell him
who you are.</i>

02:14.008 --> 02:16.136
<i>It's like giving him permission.</i>

02:16.177 --> 02:19.472
<i>Every day I walk around
this world faking it.</i>

02:19.514 --> 02:24.978
<i>Knowing if someone, if anyone
knew the truth about me,</i>

02:25.019 --> 02:30.275
<i>they'd throw me in the deepest,
darkest pit they could find.</i>

02:30.316 --> 02:33.194
<i>It's so fucking lonely.</i>

02:34.696 --> 02:36.823
<i>But Harrison, he doesn't
have to live that way.</i>

02:36.865 --> 02:37.991
<i>If I could just be honest...</i>

02:38.032 --> 02:40.493
<i>What are you gonna tell him?</i>

02:40.535 --> 02:42.036
<i>There are a hundred
garbage bags</i>

02:42.078 --> 02:43.663
<i>with chopped up
human beings</i>

02:43.705 --> 02:45.832
<i>at the bottom of
the Atlantic Ocean?!</i>

02:45.874 --> 02:48.376
<i>What the fuck do you think
that would do to him?</i>

02:48.418 --> 02:49.794
<i>He'd turn out worse than you,</i>

02:49.836 --> 02:52.422
<i>and you are a fucking monster!</i>

03:09.814 --> 03:12.275
<i>Ah. Huh?</i>

03:16.029 --> 03:17.488
<i>You're shitting me, right?</i>

03:17.530 --> 03:19.115
<i>Eh, I shit you not.</i>

03:19.157 --> 03:22.869
<i>Stay as long as you like.
Meals included.</i>

03:22.911 --> 03:25.288
<i>Oh...</i>

03:25.330 --> 03:27.624
<i>I have to say I'm actually
a pretty good cook.</i>

03:27.665 --> 03:31.211
<i>Can you actually be this nice?</i>

03:31.252 --> 03:33.171
<i>Oh, well, you know,</i>

03:33.213 --> 03:34.714
<i>I've been lucky in life,
you know,</i>

03:34.756 --> 03:37.717
<i>to have more than I need.</i>

03:37.759 --> 03:40.053
<i>And it wasn't always like that,
so, you know,</i>

03:40.094 --> 03:42.180
<i>I remember what
that's like, too.</i>

03:42.222 --> 03:46.100
<i>Look, it just would have
sat here empty otherwise, right?</i>

03:46.142 --> 03:49.187
<i>And...</i>

03:49.229 --> 03:51.731
<i>what do you want
from me?</i>

03:51.773 --> 03:57.237
<i>I just ask humbly
that you pay it forward.</i>

04:00.990 --> 04:02.450
<i>There a shower in there?</i>

04:02.492 --> 04:05.620
<i>Yeah. And a Jacuzzi tub.</i>

04:05.662 --> 04:10.458
<i>Oh, yeah, I am definitely
paying it forward.</i>

04:10.500 --> 04:12.710
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

04:12.752 --> 04:14.337
<i>My pleasure. Really.</i>

04:14.379 --> 04:18.424
<i>Yeah, I could fucking die
and go to heaven.</i>

04:28.476 --> 04:30.895
<i>Credit card reports
for Matt Caldwell came in.</i>

04:30.937 --> 04:32.897
<i>-And?
- Just like Kurt said,</i>

04:32.939 --> 04:34.274
<i>that motherfucker was held up
at the Gramercy Suites</i>

04:34.315 --> 04:35.733
<i>the last three nights.</i>

04:35.775 --> 04:37.443
<i>-Damn it.
- What?</i>

04:37.485 --> 04:38.945
<i>No dead guy, no podcast.</i>

04:39.821 --> 04:42.198
<i>I mean yay, he's alive.</i>

04:42.240 --> 04:44.450
<i>Wait, so he's been eating
five-star room service</i>

04:44.492 --> 04:46.286
<i>while I've had half the town
freezing their asses off</i>

04:46.327 --> 04:48.788
<i>searching for him?</i>

04:48.830 --> 04:50.331
<i>I knew the guy was an asshole,
but this is</i>

04:50.373 --> 04:52.125
<i>-an all-new level.
- Yeah.</i>

04:52.166 --> 04:55.253
<i>I've got half a mind
to drive to the city</i>

04:55.295 --> 04:56.963
<i>and see Matt Caldwell
face-to-face.</i>

04:57.005 --> 04:58.589
<i>I'm down.</i>

04:58.631 --> 04:59.841
<i>-Seriously?
- Yeah.</i>

04:59.882 --> 05:01.759
<i>Cue up the Taylor Swift.
Let's roll.</i>

05:01.801 --> 05:03.303
<i>At least this way
we can put it to bed.</i>

05:03.344 --> 05:04.804
<i>Finally get some closure.</i>

05:04.846 --> 05:06.264
<i>And this would have
nothing to do with you</i>

05:06.306 --> 05:08.266
<i>ambushing Matt
to salvage your podcast?</i>

05:08.308 --> 05:10.268
<i>Speaking of closure,</i>

05:10.310 --> 05:12.770
<i>maybe now is a good time
to mention</i>

05:12.812 --> 05:14.314
<i>that I've met someone new.</i>

05:14.355 --> 05:16.024
<i>Online. We've only exchanged
a few messages.</i>

05:16.065 --> 05:18.067
<i>He's a flat-earther,
but it's very serious.</i>

05:18.109 --> 05:20.737
<i>You know, actually,
it is great timing.</i>

05:20.778 --> 05:22.071
<i>There's a missing persons
conference in the city</i>

05:22.113 --> 05:23.156
<i>I wanted to go to
this weekend.</i>

05:23.197 --> 05:25.158
<i>Oh, my God, that's perfect.</i>

05:25.199 --> 05:26.659
<i>Maybe we can get some hints
on this</i>

05:26.701 --> 05:28.578
<i>Bermuda Triangle you have here.</i>

05:28.619 --> 05:30.496
<i>Problem is, there's no way the
county would approve the cost.</i>

05:30.538 --> 05:33.624
<i>Well, I can expense it. Done.</i>

05:33.666 --> 05:35.543
<i>Logan, you can watch
the station, right?</i>

05:36.544 --> 05:37.837
<i>Road trip!</i>

05:37.879 --> 05:40.006
<i>Thank God. No offense,
but this town was</i>

05:40.048 --> 05:42.383
<i>getting me a little
claustrophobic.</i>

05:45.511 --> 05:47.180
<i>You asked for it.</i>

05:47.221 --> 05:49.682
<i>Dad, you wouldn't believe
what happened in school today.</i>

05:49.724 --> 05:51.351
<i>There was this big assembly,</i>

05:51.392 --> 05:53.269
<i>and everyone was, like,
cheering for me.</i>

05:53.311 --> 05:54.896
<i>It was crazy.</i>

06:03.654 --> 06:05.573
<i>You went through my stuff.</i>

06:05.615 --> 06:07.700
<i>We need to talk.</i>

06:08.701 --> 06:11.204
<i>I only carry that
for protection.</i>

06:11.245 --> 06:12.872
<i>Protection?</i>

06:12.914 --> 06:15.083
<i>From what?</i>

06:15.124 --> 06:17.460
<i>I-I was on my own
for a long time.</i>

06:17.502 --> 06:20.797
<i>Sleeping in the streets.
People do weird shit.</i>

06:20.838 --> 06:24.133
<i>The first time I got robbed,
they took everything.</i>

06:24.175 --> 06:27.011
<i>The next time, I was ready.</i>

06:27.053 --> 06:29.097
<i>Okay.</i>

06:30.598 --> 06:32.558
<i>So why'd you take it to school?</i>

06:34.685 --> 06:37.397
<i>I'm not judging you, I just
want to know the truth.</i>

06:40.274 --> 06:41.901
<i>I heard Ethan's side
of the story.</i>

06:41.943 --> 06:43.736
<i>It's a hell of a lot different
than yours.</i>

06:43.778 --> 06:45.905
<i>What the fuck?
You believe some</i>

06:45.947 --> 06:49.325
<i>psycho school shooter over me?</i>

06:49.367 --> 06:52.745
<i>What do you think I did?
Say it.</i>

06:52.787 --> 06:55.581
<i>If you did hurt him...</i>

06:57.125 --> 06:59.252
<i>...on purpose...</i>

07:00.461 --> 07:02.463
<i>...you can tell me.</i>

07:02.505 --> 07:05.466
<i>The rest of this town thinks
I'm a fucking hero,</i>

07:05.508 --> 07:07.510
<i>and my own dad thinks I'm what?</i>

07:07.552 --> 07:10.054
<i>A liar? An animal?</i>

07:10.096 --> 07:11.556
<i>No. I think you're a kid.</i>

07:11.597 --> 07:13.349
<i>I think you're
going through something</i>

07:13.391 --> 07:15.268
<i>that maybe you don't understand.</i>

07:16.769 --> 07:20.898
<i>I just want to help you.
Harrison, you can trust me.</i>

07:22.775 --> 07:25.611
<i>Why the fuck would I trust you?</i>

07:30.116 --> 07:33.411
<i>You're the one living a lie...
Jim.</i>

08:07.945 --> 08:09.739
<i>What the fuck are you
doing here?</i>

08:09.780 --> 08:12.158
<i>Dude.</i>

08:12.200 --> 08:13.451
<i>Fuck you, man.</i>

08:16.871 --> 08:18.372
<i>You were fucking right.</i>

08:18.414 --> 08:21.125
<i>We're dicks. All of us.</i>

08:21.167 --> 08:22.168
<i>Now come on.</i>

08:22.210 --> 08:23.711
<i>What do you say, huh?</i>

08:23.753 --> 08:25.046
<i>Give the bully a hug. Huh?</i>

08:26.923 --> 08:29.008
<i>Yo, we're gonna be late.</i>

08:29.050 --> 08:30.426
<i>For what?</i>

08:30.468 --> 08:32.512
<i>There's a fucking party
tonight, bro.</i>

08:32.553 --> 08:34.889
<i>You're the guest of honor.
Now get in, let's go.</i>

08:34.931 --> 08:36.641
<i>Huh?</i>

08:41.812 --> 08:43.231
<i>Give me a beer.</i>

08:46.067 --> 08:48.194
<i>Come on, let's go.</i>

08:48.236 --> 08:50.196
<i>Get in.</i>

08:50.238 --> 08:52.323
<i>Hey, Mom.</i>

08:52.365 --> 08:54.492
<i>Harrison's hanging out with Zach
and those guys tonight.</i>

08:54.534 --> 08:55.993
<i>Is it cool if I meet them?</i>

08:56.035 --> 08:58.120
<i>-It's a school night.
- It's Friday.</i>

08:58.162 --> 09:00.498
<i>Oh, come on, I'll make sure
she's home by eleven.</i>

09:00.540 --> 09:02.667
<i>Absolutely. Eleven.</i>

09:02.708 --> 09:04.168
<i>Nya:weh, hakso:t.</i>

09:04.210 --> 09:07.171
<i>-You're welcome,</i> <i>keya:de'.
- It's fine.</i>

09:10.174 --> 09:11.801
<i>Harrison's a good kid.</i>

09:11.842 --> 09:14.303
<i>Everyone's talking about
what he did for the school.</i>

09:14.345 --> 09:16.973
<i>You keep too short a leash
on them,</i>

09:17.014 --> 09:18.933
<i>you could lose 'em for good.</i>

09:18.975 --> 09:21.102
<i>We'll be back by Sunday morning.</i>

09:21.143 --> 09:23.062
<i>Nya:weh, Miriam.</i>

09:23.104 --> 09:25.022
<i>I think you're crazy</i>

09:25.064 --> 09:26.941
<i>We do this daily</i>

09:26.983 --> 09:28.693
<i>Might think of something...</i>

09:28.734 --> 09:30.111
<i>What the fuck?</i>

09:30.152 --> 09:32.905
<i>Welcome to the kill list party.</i>

09:32.947 --> 09:35.408
<i>Written invitation only.</i>

09:35.449 --> 09:37.159
<i>There ain't nothin'
that could ever...</i>

09:37.201 --> 09:42.039
<i>Everybody in here is alive
because of you.</i>

09:42.081 --> 09:43.040
<i>Hey, yo!</i>

09:51.591 --> 09:56.512
<i>There's no way we could unfeel
the way we feelin'...</i>

09:56.554 --> 09:58.222
<i>Let's fucking party!</i>

10:00.891 --> 10:04.437
<i>Somebody get this motherfucker
a drink!</i>

10:04.478 --> 10:06.230
<i>-Hey, Tess.</i>

10:06.272 --> 10:08.566
<i>My phone's dying.
Do you mind?</i>

10:08.608 --> 10:11.193
<i>That's what it's there for.</i>

10:13.821 --> 10:15.448
<i>I'll take a Jameson, neat.</i>

10:15.489 --> 10:18.117
<i>No IPA tonight?</i>

10:18.159 --> 10:20.703
<i>I'm in the mood
for something stronger.</i>

10:22.663 --> 10:24.457
<i>Where's Angela?</i>

10:24.498 --> 10:28.753
<i>Uh, she's down in Manhattan
at some police conference.</i>

10:34.717 --> 10:36.469
<i>How's your boy?</i>

10:36.510 --> 10:38.596
<i>All the kids are pretty shaken
up after what happened.</i>

10:38.638 --> 10:40.598
<i>He's been better.</i>

10:40.640 --> 10:42.350
<i>I know Harrison's
the big hero,</i>

10:42.391 --> 10:44.018
<i>and he did the right thing,</i>

10:44.060 --> 10:45.978
<i>but it still can't be easy</i>

10:46.020 --> 10:48.356
<i>knowing you hurt
another human being.</i>

10:49.315 --> 10:52.109
<i>Or maybe it was too easy.</i>

10:53.152 --> 10:56.614
<i>You know, sometimes I feel</i>

10:56.656 --> 10:59.033
<i>out of my depth.</i>

10:59.075 --> 11:00.826
<i>It's okay to ask for help.</i>

11:03.371 --> 11:07.958
<i>There's a therapist
over in Fort Drum.</i>

11:08.000 --> 11:10.169
<i>I had a student
a couple years ago.</i>

11:10.211 --> 11:12.463
<i>He helped her.</i>

11:12.505 --> 11:15.007
<i>Maybe he could help Harrison.</i>

11:15.049 --> 11:17.635
<i>You know, if there's things
he's not ready to</i>

11:17.677 --> 11:19.345
<i>talk to his dad about.</i>

11:19.387 --> 11:22.306
<i>-Yeah, okay.
- Cool.</i>

11:22.348 --> 11:26.852
<i>Dr. Morris.</i>

11:28.562 --> 11:31.315
<i>-Thanks, Tess.
- No problem.</i>

11:31.357 --> 11:35.695
<i>Come on, let's have
a party, huh?</i>

11:35.736 --> 11:37.571
<i>Come on, you guys.</i>

11:39.740 --> 11:42.201
<i>What's with him?</i>

11:42.243 --> 11:44.078
<i>He gets like this
every couple months.</i>

11:44.120 --> 11:46.414
<i>Walks in here
like he owns the place.</i>

11:51.877 --> 11:54.588
<i>That same song.</i>

11:54.630 --> 11:57.550
<i>Always that same fucking song.</i>

11:57.591 --> 12:01.512
<i>As I walk along I wonder</i>

12:01.554 --> 12:05.015
<i>What went wrong
with our love</i>

12:05.057 --> 12:08.394
<i>A love that was so strong</i>

12:09.937 --> 12:12.398
<i>And as I still walk on</i>

12:12.440 --> 12:17.486
<i>I think of the things
we've done together</i>

12:17.528 --> 12:20.656
<i>While our hearts
were young...</i>

12:20.698 --> 12:22.408
<i>Wait for it.</i>

12:22.450 --> 12:26.328
<i>He's gonna come ask me to dance
in four, three, two...</i>

12:26.370 --> 12:28.873
<i>Tears are falling
and I feel the pain</i>

12:28.914 --> 12:30.207
<i>- Wishing you were</i>

12:30.249 --> 12:31.333
<i>- Here by me</i>
<i></i>

12:31.375 --> 12:33.586
<i>To end this misery</i>

12:33.627 --> 12:36.380
<i>-Hey, Jim.
- And I wonder</i>

12:36.422 --> 12:40.926
<i>I wo-wo-wo-wo-wonder</i>

12:40.968 --> 12:45.431
<i>Why, why, why, why, why,
why she ran away...</i>

12:45.473 --> 12:46.974
<i>Look at him.</i>

12:47.016 --> 12:50.603
<i>His son reduced to ashes,
and there he is,</i>

12:50.644 --> 12:53.230
<i>dancing like he doesn't have
a care in the world.</i>

12:53.272 --> 12:54.482
<i>My little runaway...</i>

12:54.523 --> 12:59.779
<i>Either he's crazy, or I am.</i>

12:59.820 --> 13:01.655
<i>I'm-a spend this holiday
locked in</i>

<i>Put a bad bitch
in the friend zone</i>

13:08.329 --> 13:09.789

13:19.340 --> 13:21.634
<i>You barely text me back anymore.</i>

13:21.675 --> 13:22.802
<i>Sorry.</i>

13:22.843 --> 13:24.428
<i>Was it the podcast I sent?</i>

13:24.470 --> 13:26.388
<i>I mean, I get it.
Maybe not everyone thinks</i>

13:26.430 --> 13:27.640
<i>serial killers are funny.</i>

13:30.434 --> 13:34.313
<i>I-I, um... I liked it.</i>

13:34.355 --> 13:35.940
<i>You know, some-sometimes
you got to laugh</i>

13:35.981 --> 13:37.942
<i>at the fucked-up stuff, right?</i>

13:37.983 --> 13:38.984
<i>I mean, look around.</i>

- Yes, we do.</i>

13:46.867 --> 13:49.119
<i>How does it feel to have
that kind of power?</i>

13:49.161 --> 13:50.621
<i>Life or death.</i>

13:53.707 --> 13:56.502

<i>All right.</i>

20:15.756 --> 20:17.007
<i>What is this?</i>

20:17.049 --> 20:18.675
<i>Just Oxy.
A bunch of us took them.</i>

20:18.717 --> 20:21.220

<i>You didn't even know

42:36.512 --> 42:39.765
<i>-No! Please, please.</i>

42:46.272 --> 42:48.482
<i>Run, bitch.</i>

42:50.818 --> 42:52.027
<i>Come on.</i>

42:52.069 --> 42:55.573
<i>Run. Go, or I will kill you.</i>

42:57.283 --> 43:01.036
<i>-Run. Run!</i>

43:01.078 --> 43:02.746
<i>Fuck!
- No.</i>

43:02.788 --> 43:04.873
<i>No, no. This is not the way
it's supposed to happen. No!</i>

43:10.129 --> 43:13.173
<i>No. No, no, no, no, no, no.</i>

43:13.215 --> 43:15.426
<i>No. No. No, no.</i>

43:19.805 --> 43:23.434
<i>You... you ruined everything.</i>

43:28.731 --> 43:30.691
<i>slow, somber music</i>

43:37.239 --> 43:39.533
<i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>

43:50.919 --> 43:53.339
<i></i>

44:01.805 --> 44:03.682
<i>Detective Batista.</i>

44:03.724 --> 44:06.268
<i>Angela Bishop,
Police Chief in Iron Lake.</i>

44:06.310 --> 44:08.979
<i>-Iron Lake?
- It's upstate.</i>

44:09.021 --> 44:11.023
<i>Oh. Nice to meet you.</i>

44:11.065 --> 44:13.275
<i>No bodies?</i>

44:13.317 --> 44:16.695
<i>Just one backpack left
in a truck stop parking lot.</i>

44:16.737 --> 44:20.407
<i>Parents calling,
looking for their daughters.</i>

44:20.449 --> 44:22.242
<i>What's the pattern?</i>

44:22.284 --> 44:24.244
<i>Women, 15 to 25.</i>

44:24.286 --> 44:26.914
<i>Transients,
prostitutes, runaways.</i>

44:26.955 --> 44:29.124
<i>People who wouldn't be missed
by law enforcement.</i>

44:29.166 --> 44:31.043
<i>Not much of a pattern.</i>

44:31.085 --> 44:32.753
<i>But I like your style.</i>

44:32.795 --> 44:36.173
<i>Aggressive, almost... bossy.</i>

44:38.217 --> 44:40.094
<i>I have a boyfriend.</i>

44:40.135 --> 44:41.637
<i>Can he handle you?</i>

44:41.679 --> 44:42.763
<i>He chops his own wood.</i>

44:42.805 --> 44:46.517
<i>Right. That's cool.</i>

44:46.558 --> 44:49.353
<i>So, a dozen women were last seen</i>

44:49.395 --> 44:51.271
<i>within a few miles
of my small town.</i>

44:51.313 --> 44:53.857
<i>I know nobody else gives a shit,</i>

44:53.899 --> 44:56.860
<i>but my gut is telling me
it's not a goddamn coincidence.</i>

44:56.902 --> 44:58.862
<i>When's the first time
you felt that?</i>

44:58.904 --> 45:01.532
<i>The feeling
that something is off?</i>

45:02.157 --> 45:06.787
<i>My best friend disappeared
when we were teenagers.</i>

45:06.829 --> 45:11.667
<i>She just walked off
down the highway one day,</i>

45:11.709 --> 45:13.877
<i>never came back.</i>

45:13.919 --> 45:16.714
<i>Listen to your gut.</i>

45:16.755 --> 45:20.050
<i>You find out the why,
you'll find out the who.</i>

45:21.260 --> 45:23.220
<i>Another round?</i>

45:23.262 --> 45:25.222
<i>Promise, purely platonic.</i>

45:25.264 --> 45:28.934
<i>Wouldn't want to find myself
on the wrong end of an ax.</i>

45:28.976 --> 45:31.854
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

45:31.895 --> 45:33.689
<i>Thank you.</i>

45:33.731 --> 45:37.109
<i>You know, that...
that feeling you have?</i>

45:37.151 --> 45:39.361
<i>It reminds me of another case</i>

45:39.403 --> 45:41.864
<i>back in the day,
the Trinity Killer.</i>

45:41.905 --> 45:45.200
<i>No one understood
how those deaths were related.</i>

45:45.242 --> 45:46.535
<i>So how'd you guys crack it?</i>

45:46.577 --> 45:48.579
<i>A young detective, Debra Morgan,</i>

45:48.620 --> 45:50.748
<i>she always had
a gut feeling about it.</i>

45:50.789 --> 45:52.374
<i>Never gave up.</i>

45:52.416 --> 45:55.252
<i>So, maybe she could help us?</i>

45:55.294 --> 45:57.004
<i>She died.</i>

45:57.045 --> 45:59.006
<i>Real fucked-up situation.</i>

45:59.047 --> 46:01.258
<i>Her brother, too.
Tragic, really.</i>

46:01.300 --> 46:03.218
<i>He had a little son.</i>

46:03.260 --> 46:05.345
<i>What was his name?</i>

46:06.430 --> 46:09.641
<i>Ah. I...</i>

46:09.683 --> 46:12.019
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

46:12.060 --> 46:15.439
<i>Harrison. Cute kid.</i>

46:27.493 --> 46:29.453
<i>contemplative music</i>

46:53.143 --> 46:54.478
<i>Who the fuck are you?</i>

46:54.520 --> 46:57.147
<i>I don't know.
Your worst nightmare?</i>

46:57.189 --> 46:59.483
<i>Or maybe you're mine.</i>

46:59.525 --> 47:01.902
<i>What? No.</i>

47:01.944 --> 47:03.737
<i>Let's just say,
you're a friend of a friend</i>

47:03.779 --> 47:05.322
<i>of a friend of my son's.</i>

47:05.364 --> 47:07.449
<i>It's nice to meet you, Jasper.</i>

47:10.077 --> 47:12.871
<i>What? What?</i>

47:12.913 --> 47:15.791
<i>What is happening?
What? What? What?</i>

47:15.833 --> 47:17.543
<i>No, don't look away.</i>

47:17.584 --> 47:19.628
<i>Those are
all people you killed.</i>

47:19.670 --> 47:21.338
<i>You're fucking crazy.
I never killed anyone.</i>

47:21.380 --> 47:24.007
<i>Wrong. They all died
because of drugs you gave them.</i>

47:24.049 --> 47:26.593
<i>You might be right
about the first thing.</i>

47:27.761 --> 47:29.263
<i>What are you gonna do to me?</i>

47:32.808 --> 47:34.142
<i>No.</i>

47:38.063 --> 47:39.523
<i>I think
you've lived long enough.</i>

47:39.565 --> 47:41.149
<i>They come to me begging for it,
all right.</i>

47:41.191 --> 47:43.277
<i>I'm not forcing it
down anyone's throats!</i>

47:43.318 --> 47:46.321
<i>My son didn't come to you,
and he took one of those pills.</i>

47:46.363 --> 47:50.117
<i>Well, he's a weak fucking
junkie like the rest of them.</i>

47:50.158 --> 47:51.577
<i>You know,
what kind of dad are you anyway,</i>

47:51.618 --> 47:53.495
<i>if your son was fucked-up enough
to do that?</i>

47:53.537 --> 47:55.539
<i>You're a weak dad!</i>

47:56.915 --> 47:58.709
<i>I am a great fucking dad.</i>

48:16.643 --> 48:19.354
<i>Fucking Logan.</i>

48:45.923 --> 48:47.883
<i>Hey.</i>

48:47.925 --> 48:49.718
<i>Harrison?</i>

48:49.760 --> 48:52.054
<i>What are you doing
all the way out here?</i>

48:52.095 --> 48:54.431
<i>Headed out of town, for good.</i>

48:54.473 --> 48:56.642
<i>Oh, really?</i>

48:56.683 --> 49:00.228
<i>How about I buy you a hot meal</i>

49:00.270 --> 49:02.439
<i>before you go
on your grand adventure?</i>

49:02.481 --> 49:04.608
<i>Hmm? Deal?</i>

49:09.947 --> 49:11.406
<i>What happened to your face?</i>

49:12.407 --> 49:15.035
<i>Uh, it's a hunting accident.</i>

49:15.953 --> 49:18.747
<i>I'll meet you inside.</i>

49:28.840 --> 49:31.051
<i>[Dexter]</i> <i>There are always
sacrifices one has to make</i>

49:31.093 --> 49:32.803
<i>-as a parent.
No.</i>

49:32.844 --> 49:34.429
<i>Especially the parent
of a teenager.</i>

49:34.471 --> 49:36.473
<i>-Shh, shh.</i>

49:36.515 --> 49:38.475
<i>You don't always get
to do the things</i>

49:38.517 --> 49:39.851
<i>you want the way you want.</i>

49:54.282 --> 49:56.910
<i>But we can make
these small sacrifices</i>

49:56.952 --> 49:59.079
<i>for the good of our children.</i>

50:08.839 --> 50:11.133
<i>Hands up! Hands up!</i>

50:11.174 --> 50:13.218
<i>Let me see your hands up!
All the way up!</i>

50:17.889 --> 50:20.517
<i>Goddamn it.</i>

50:22.644 --> 50:25.188
<i>After all, if we can't do that,</i>

50:25.230 --> 50:28.025
<i>we don't deserve to be parents.</i>

50:30.736 --> 50:34.031
<i>He checked out
at 11:30 last night.</i>

50:37.993 --> 50:40.203
<i>There he is.</i>

50:40.245 --> 50:41.621
<i>Matt Caldwell.</i>

50:49.087 --> 50:50.422
<i>You're right. There he is.</i>

50:50.464 --> 50:52.049
<i>All checked out.</i>

50:52.090 --> 50:54.426
<i>Sorry to bother you
with this, sir.</i>

50:54.468 --> 50:55.886
<i>Thanks so much for your time.</i>

50:55.927 --> 50:58.555
<i>-Just, uh...</i>

50:58.597 --> 51:00.849
<i>For my records.
Thanks again.</i>

51:03.685 --> 51:05.103
<i>Who the fuck was that?</i>

51:05.145 --> 51:07.898
<i>Why would Kurt lie?</i>

51:08.482 --> 51:10.901
<i></i>

51:17.115 --> 51:18.909
<i>So, you have any money?</i>

51:20.952 --> 51:23.371
<i>I thought you were getting this.</i>

51:23.413 --> 51:25.415
Not for the food.

51:25.457 --> 51:27.542
<i>For your new life.</i>

51:27.584 --> 51:30.087
<i>-Not really.
- Oh.</i>

51:30.128 --> 51:33.256
<i>Well, that's not really
a great plan, is it?</i>

51:33.298 --> 51:37.552
<i>Hitchhiking to God-knows-where
with not a dollar to your name.</i>

51:37.594 --> 51:39.262
<i>It's a dangerous world
out there, kid.</i>

51:39.304 --> 51:41.723
<i>How do you think I got
to Iron Lake?</i>

51:41.765 --> 51:43.058
<i>Oh.</i>

51:43.100 --> 51:46.019
<i>Look, uh...</i>

51:46.061 --> 51:47.562
<i>I know things
have been complicated</i>

51:47.604 --> 51:49.731
<i>between you and your dad.</i>

51:49.773 --> 51:51.108
<i>Hell, there were times with Matt</i>

51:51.149 --> 51:53.652
<i>when I wanted to write him off
entirely.</i>

51:53.693 --> 51:55.153
<i>And our fights were nothing</i>

51:55.195 --> 51:57.489
<i>compared to the blowouts
I had with my old man.</i>

51:57.531 --> 51:58.907
<i>Look, you don't have to do this.</i>

51:58.949 --> 52:01.159
<i>Try and make it better.</i>

52:01.201 --> 52:02.953
<i>What, what's happening
between us</i>

52:02.994 --> 52:04.830
<i>has been going on
for a long time.</i>

52:04.871 --> 52:07.457
<i>Hey. You know, I've been around
a little bit longer than you,</i>

52:07.499 --> 52:09.126
<i>and I've seen a few things.</i>

52:09.167 --> 52:10.544
<i>So I'm gonna give you
a little advice,</i>

52:10.585 --> 52:12.754
<i>whether you like it or not.</i>

52:15.257 --> 52:17.384
<i>Now, in those moments,</i>

52:17.425 --> 52:20.011
<i>when all you see is red,</i>

52:20.053 --> 52:23.974
<i>just go and do something kind</i>

52:24.015 --> 52:26.643
<i>for the person
that's pissing you off.</i>

52:27.978 --> 52:31.982
<i>Even if you don't want to,
especially if you don't want to.</i>

52:33.316 --> 52:34.818
<i>Yeah, I think
we might be past that.</i>

52:36.611 --> 52:39.239
<i>Ah. Well, take it or leave it.</i>

52:42.117 --> 52:45.162
<i>Run as far
and as long as you want,</i>

52:45.203 --> 52:48.331
<i>you can never outrun that rage.</i>

<i>Susan.</i>

52:58.758 --> 53:00.177
<i>-Yeah?
- Could you, uh,</i>

53:00.218 --> 53:02.262
<i>get me one of
those applications?</i>

53:05.223 --> 53:07.225
<i>Well, you want a new life?</i>

53:07.267 --> 53:09.978
<i>Start by getting
a fucking job. Here.</i>

53:10.020 --> 53:12.522
<i>I'll give you one.</i>

53:14.191 --> 53:16.526
<i>Why are you being so nice to me?</i>

53:16.568 --> 53:18.987
<i>You must have
other places to be.</i>

53:22.741 --> 53:24.910
<i>You got potential, kid.</i>

53:24.951 --> 53:26.536
<i>I can see it.</i>

53:27.537 --> 53:29.539
<i>Just pay it forward.</i>

53:58.735 --> 54:00.195
<i>You're not mad?</i>

54:00.237 --> 54:01.571
<i>No.</i>

54:01.613 --> 54:03.573
<i>I'm just glad you're okay.</i>

54:04.950 --> 54:08.370
<i>I mean, I know
what happened was scary.</i>

54:08.411 --> 54:10.747
<i>Harrison's gonna be okay.</i>

54:14.501 --> 54:16.461
<i>Scott's not in trouble.</i>

54:16.503 --> 54:19.256
<i>I mean, any more than usual.</i>

54:20.674 --> 54:23.760
<i>No one's gonna be mad at you.</i>

54:23.802 --> 54:25.762
<i>You saved Harrison's life.</i>

54:25.804 --> 54:28.431
Whatever.

54:30.558 --> 54:33.144
<i>So, what's bothering you?</i>

54:36.439 --> 54:39.192
<i>Harrison said something weird.</i>

54:39.234 --> 54:41.486
<i>Right before he passed out.</i>

54:43.154 --> 54:44.698
<i>Okay.</i>

54:46.241 --> 54:48.827
<i>He said his dad's name
isn't Jim Lindsay.</i>

<i>Hey.</i>

54:57.585 --> 54:59.421

<i>I'm good.</i>

<i>How was therapy?</i>

55:03.425 --> 55:05.719
<i>You like the doctor?</i>

55:05.760 --> 55:10.181
<i>Actually, it-it felt great
to talk to someone.</i>

55:10.223 --> 55:13.101
<i>Well, that's great to hear.</i>

55:14.769 --> 55:17.439
<i>I'm gonna go lie down.
Doctor said to get some rest.</i>

55:17.480 --> 55:19.733
<i>Of course.</i>

any dinner?</i>

we have it all figured out.</i>

55:27.866 --> 55:30.660
<i>We think we can control things.</i>

55:30.702 --> 55:33.163
<i>Fix them.</i>

55:33.204 --> 55:34.956
<i>That we can keep life
moving forward</i>

<i>on the path we've chosen.</i>

<i>intriguing music</i>

55:52.182 --> 55:54.184

<i>But all that's standing
between us and chaos</i>

55:56.728 --> 56:00.690
<i>-is a tiny, fragile thread.</i>

56:00.732 --> 56:03.193
<i>Cut that thread,</i>

<i>But it's hard
when all this rearranging</i>

<i>Means I might be losing you</i>

56:32.806 --> 56:36.684
<i>I wanna soar
