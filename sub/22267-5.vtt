00:40.003 --> 00:42.470
- I feel things for you.
- I got to get the hell out of town.

00:42.472 --> 00:44.206
I'll take you wherever you want to go.

00:44.231 --> 00:45.850
Rebecca. We need to talk about this.

00:45.875 --> 00:48.009
If I'm crazy, you made me crazier,

00:48.011 --> 00:50.018
because your life is broken and boring.

00:50.043 --> 00:52.767
Your boyfriend does not
want a baby with you.

00:53.823 --> 00:56.817
I've officially
alienated every person I know.

00:56.819 --> 00:58.275
You moved here for Josh Chan?

00:58.300 --> 00:59.799
Of course you would do something

00:59.801 --> 01:01.201
like give up your
wonderful life in New York

01:01.203 --> 01:03.370
to be near that... that loser!

01:03.372 --> 01:04.638
You're absolutely right.

01:04.640 --> 01:05.763
I give up.

01:07.042 --> 01:08.325
I'll come home.

01:09.211 --> 01:10.777
We got even more sunshine

01:10.779 --> 01:12.245
coming up this week.

01:12.247 --> 01:14.080
Let's go ahead and take
a look at the satellite...

01:14.082 --> 01:15.682
Your life is broken and boring.

01:15.684 --> 01:18.585
Your boyfriend does not
want a baby with you.

01:18.587 --> 01:20.186
If I'm crazy, you made me crazier.

01:20.188 --> 01:21.488
I'm sick and tired of you.

01:21.490 --> 01:22.589
I want you out of my life!

01:22.591 --> 01:23.690
And don't call me Cookie!

01:23.692 --> 01:25.125
I hate that name. I hate it.

01:25.127 --> 01:26.893
It is laughable that you're my boss.

01:28.697 --> 01:30.096
Rebecca?

01:30.098 --> 01:32.299
Rebecca! What are you doing in there?

01:32.301 --> 01:33.967
... 64 in Harris, and in the afternoon..

01:33.969 --> 01:36.169
Okay. That's enough.

01:36.171 --> 01:38.233
Give me this thing.

01:38.774 --> 01:40.674
You've been in this bed the whole day.

01:40.676 --> 01:43.143
I've let you mope long enough.
We have got to talk plans.

01:43.145 --> 01:45.845
Is this a vacation? Is this
a sabbatical? What is this?

01:45.847 --> 01:47.147
What am I telling people?

01:47.149 --> 01:48.952
Tell people whatever you want.

01:48.977 --> 01:50.517
Whatever I want? Okay.

01:50.519 --> 01:53.515
Well, for starters, are you
going back to California or not?

01:55.444 --> 01:56.925
I don't have all day, darling.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.725
No, I'm not. I'm-I'm not.

01:58.727 --> 02:00.961
I mean, there's... there's
nothing left for me there, so...

02:00.963 --> 02:02.362
Okay, then, it's settled.

02:02.364 --> 02:03.666
You're staying here,

02:03.691 --> 02:05.332
and you're getting your old job back.

02:05.564 --> 02:06.700
You know, my darling,

02:06.702 --> 02:08.368
it's time that I take over
the reins of your life,

02:08.370 --> 02:10.470
because clearly, you're incapable.

02:10.495 --> 02:12.839
Yep. You're right.

02:13.332 --> 02:14.892
I'm right?

02:16.211 --> 02:17.855
Then, we're in agreement.

02:17.880 --> 02:19.324
You're staying here.

02:19.349 --> 02:21.247
I'll send in your resignation,

02:21.249 --> 02:22.434
and I will send for your stuff.

02:22.459 --> 02:23.892
Sounds good. Thank you.

02:24.437 --> 02:25.910
Exactly.

02:27.376 --> 02:28.801

I don't know. Honestly?

03:39.561 --> 03:41.528
- I know.
- No, not that.

03:41.530 --> 03:44.364
What's weird is that Rebecca's
in Scarsdale and not here,

03:44.389 --> 03:47.233
and I need to talk to her
about a personal issue.

03:47.235 --> 03:48.735
You can talk to me, D-Money.

03:48.737 --> 03:50.303
No, I can't.

It's about me and White Josh,
and you're so obsessed with us.

03:53.837 --> 03:56.040
You just start talking
all that millennial-speak.

03:56.065 --> 03:58.626
No, come on, please. Tell me
what's going on with you two.

04:00.041 --> 04:01.374
Okay.

Yeah. Well, I got to talk to Rebecca.

04:24.673 --> 04:25.872
She's perceptive.

04:25.874 --> 04:27.440
I mean, she knew White
Josh didn't want a baby

04:27.442 --> 04:28.842
before anyone else did.

04:30.239 --> 04:32.712
What is that noise? What's happening?

04:32.714 --> 04:34.808
I think one of our computers is in pain.

04:34.833 --> 04:37.117
It's our fax machine, loser.

04:37.119 --> 04:38.485

Ow, it's hot.

04:42.424 --> 04:43.590
It's so hot.

04:43.592 --> 04:46.359
Probably from my dad. He
loves a good fax machine.

04:46.361 --> 04:48.665
It's the only time I ever
heard him use the word "love."

04:48.715 --> 04:50.938
- Oh.
- Let me see that.

04:58.607 --> 05:01.241
It's, uh, it's nothing.

05:01.243 --> 05:03.688
Um, Rebecca resigned.

05:03.713 --> 05:06.437
- Resigned? No.
- This can't be happening.

05:06.462 --> 05:08.081
Rebecca was supposed to be my mentor

05:08.083 --> 05:10.717
for my mentor program,
Girl-Boss-Power-Force.

05:10.719 --> 05:11.818
I have no one else.

05:11.820 --> 05:13.219
Paula's out sick,

05:13.221 --> 05:16.055
Karen took a leave of absence
to be a hand-and-foot model,

05:16.057 --> 05:18.048
Mrs. Hernandez is such a bitch.

05:18.073 --> 05:20.260
- Get LASIK, nerd.
- See what I mean?

05:20.262 --> 05:21.794
All right, everyone listen up.

05:21.796 --> 05:22.996
We're down a lawyer,

05:22.998 --> 05:24.697
and that's bad news,
especially right now.

05:24.699 --> 05:27.066
The time-share case is
not gonna settle itself.

05:27.068 --> 05:28.268
I'll call the downtown office,

05:28.270 --> 05:30.101

replacement for Rebecca.

05:30.126 --> 05:32.906
What? You can't replace Rebecca.

05:32.908 --> 05:34.474
Nathaniel, please.

05:34.476 --> 05:36.943
Can we wait? Can we at
least just talk about this?

05:36.945 --> 05:39.646
It's done. All right? This is happening.

05:39.773 --> 05:41.514
We all just need to move on.

05:41.516 --> 05:43.082

05:43.084 --> 05:44.517
I don't want to hear her name.

even think about Rebecca.

05:47.976 --> 05:49.265

05:51.716 --> 05:53.015
No.

05:53.228 --> 05:54.661

06:02.438 --> 06:03.898

06:07.042 --> 06:09.275
- Rebecca, you need to calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down.

06:13.003 --> 06:15.023
No.

06:20.989 --> 06:22.554
So.

06:22.579 --> 06:24.257
I resigned you from Whitepepper,

06:24.259 --> 06:26.593

letter to your old law firm

06:26.595 --> 06:27.827

06:27.829 --> 06:29.262

06:31.332 --> 06:33.333
No, I... we don't need
to go over it, okay?

06:33.335 --> 06:34.934
I'm-I'm... I... it's fine.

06:34.936 --> 06:36.836
Just send it. Doesn't
matter. I'm sure it's good.

06:36.838 --> 06:38.738
It is. It's very good, but...

06:40.208 --> 06:41.274

behind the elephant.

Honey.

07:04.142 --> 07:05.231
Please.

07:05.908 --> 07:07.967
I think that's enough.

07:07.969 --> 07:09.936
It's my friendaversary with Rebecca.

07:09.938 --> 07:11.104
The night at Beans's party,

07:11.106 --> 07:12.705
I went home and I friended
her, and she accepted.

07:12.707 --> 07:14.474
And I know it's just an algorithm,

07:14.476 --> 07:16.809
but they just... they picked
the cutest photos, I mean...

07:16.811 --> 07:19.618
Look at this. This is
our first cookie pizza.

07:19.643 --> 07:21.247
I mean, it's just a
cookie cut into triangles.

07:21.249 --> 07:22.749
There's no cheese or anything.

07:22.751 --> 07:24.284
And we were like, "Well, we should

07:24.286 --> 07:25.551
just call it a big cookie,"

07:25.553 --> 07:28.454
and that's when I started
to call her Cookie,

07:28.456 --> 07:29.828
and now it's over.

07:32.294 --> 07:34.160
Okay, okay.

07:34.162 --> 07:35.495
This isn't healthy.

07:35.497 --> 07:36.929
Uh... Paula.

07:36.931 --> 07:39.065
You said you want to spend
more time with the family?

07:39.429 --> 07:41.953
I think that would make
you feel a lot better.

07:41.978 --> 07:43.269
And us, too.

07:43.271 --> 07:46.472
We want to spend more time with you.

07:47.598 --> 07:49.840
We all want to spend more time with you.

07:52.131 --> 07:55.065
Yes. We want to spend
more time with you, Mom.

07:55.216 --> 07:57.350
Yeah. Quality time.

07:57.352 --> 07:58.351
As a family.

07:58.353 --> 07:59.485
We have so little time

07:59.487 --> 08:00.987
before I go to college.

08:00.989 --> 08:02.422
Dad, who are we kidding?

08:02.424 --> 08:03.856
I'm not going to college.

08:03.858 --> 08:05.224
Okay, look, Mom.

08:05.226 --> 08:07.226
Dad already paid us off
to hang out with you,

08:07.228 --> 08:08.861
and I spent that $20
on illegal fireworks,

08:08.863 --> 08:10.868
so are we gonna hang out or what?

08:13.368 --> 08:15.702
Well, that is a great offer,

08:15.704 --> 08:19.337
but I don't want to do anything
but watch this video, so...

08:19.517 --> 08:20.908
What...

08:20.933 --> 08:22.342
Okay, that's it.

08:22.344 --> 08:24.177
Tommy? Get it.

08:24.179 --> 08:25.611
- No.
- Do it.

08:25.613 --> 08:27.680
- No, but, Dad, not really...
- You heard me.

08:36.294 --> 08:38.260

08:38.284 --> 08:39.659

You don't ever want to play that game

09:11.227 --> 09:12.741
You're looking at porn, aren't you?

09:12.766 --> 09:14.627
I know, that's what everyone does.

09:14.629 --> 09:16.562
The choking, the
spanking, the cuckolding.

09:16.564 --> 09:18.164
- Oh... okay...
- I'm not looking at porn.

09:18.166 --> 09:20.366
- Oh, really? Okay?
- Yeah, leave me alone.

09:26.040 --> 09:28.708
My sources downtown
say the replacement

09:28.710 --> 09:30.963
is a femme-identifying cis-gender woman.

09:31.697 --> 09:33.246
That's a lady. She's a lady.

09:33.248 --> 09:34.747
Yeah, but is she gonna be like Rebecca,

09:34.749 --> 09:36.582
all pretty and cheery and Jewy?

09:36.854 --> 09:38.313
You know what I mean...

09:38.338 --> 09:40.385
Smart, and a little sneaky.

09:40.565 --> 09:42.632
That did not come out
right. I am not a bigot.

09:42.657 --> 09:45.792
I just... I talk too much, like a Jew.

09:45.934 --> 09:47.193
Oh, no.

09:47.481 --> 09:50.696
I hope she's a strong,
contemporary thigh-high feminist

09:50.698 --> 09:52.899
like me and Rebecca,
you know what I mean?

09:52.901 --> 09:54.419
Never talk again.

09:55.075 --> 09:56.536
I just hope what happened
with me and Rebecca

09:56.538 --> 09:57.904
doesn't happen again.

09:57.906 --> 09:59.172
- Hmm?
- You know, the "will they

09:59.174 --> 10:00.673
or won't they" sexual tension?

10:01.121 --> 10:03.643
Our little peas in a pod thing?
Y-You guys didn't clock that?

10:03.645 --> 10:04.677
Hmm...

10:04.679 --> 10:06.512
So you guys didn't notice

10:06.514 --> 10:07.914
the undeniable spark?

10:07.916 --> 10:09.348
Okay.

10:09.350 --> 10:11.050
She's coming up from downstairs.

10:11.052 --> 10:12.559
Don't be yourselves, I beg you.

10:12.584 --> 10:15.387
The body's barely cool,
and you hired a new Rebecca.

10:15.412 --> 10:16.956
That is heartless. I said

10:16.958 --> 10:18.658
I didn't want to hear
the name "Rebecca" again.

10:18.660 --> 10:21.992
She's not a new Rebecca, she's
a lawyer here to do a job.

10:22.257 --> 10:24.197
She has nothing in common with Rebecca,

10:24.199 --> 10:25.298
except for her job title.

10:25.300 --> 10:26.833
Okay.

So sharply perceptive and honest.

I would love for you to weigh in

- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

11:00.969 --> 11:02.335
How do you feel about Lena Dunham

11:02.337 --> 11:04.070
and do you think pumpkin
spice lattes are basic or no?

11:04.072 --> 11:05.338
Also, are diets okay? Hi.

Ignore them. They are idiots.

Let's get you set up.

11:09.010 --> 11:10.309
As you know, we are down an attorney

11:10.311 --> 11:13.246
- and we have a lot of work to do.
- Yes, I reviewed all the cases.

11:13.248 --> 11:14.447
I'm all caught up.

Whoa. Lot of personality on this one.

I mean, did you guys see that?

11:23.445 --> 11:25.312
- Hmm?
- Flint and steel.

Hey, Cornelia.

12:17.783 --> 12:20.483
If you're not too busy, I'm
applying for this mentor-ship

12:20.508 --> 12:23.539
and I just need a woman in
my workplace to sponsor me.

12:23.564 --> 12:25.522
Oh, I did this mentor-ship.

12:25.547 --> 12:26.679
It's excellent.

12:26.829 --> 12:30.398
Looks like you just
need a signature here.

12:31.119 --> 12:32.652
You got it. Here you go.

12:33.617 --> 12:36.889
Stop. Stop. Shut up.
Just stop and shut up.

12:36.891 --> 12:38.328
You're too amazing.

12:38.353 --> 12:39.759
Honestly, just shut it down,

12:39.761 --> 12:41.527
pull the metal grate over your face,

12:41.529 --> 12:44.163
and put up a sign because you are shut!

12:44.165 --> 12:46.432
Okay.

12:46.434 --> 12:48.389
- You're welcome.
- I can't with her.

12:48.414 --> 12:51.295
I had to leave because I couldn't even.

12:51.740 --> 12:53.006
Hey. Hi.

12:53.008 --> 12:54.374
Did you get my e-mail

12:54.376 --> 12:56.175
about the Madigan estate trust case?

12:56.177 --> 12:59.579
I did. Um, you spent the
majority of the e-mail

12:59.581 --> 13:01.981
laying out the details
of your own relationship

13:01.983 --> 13:03.983
with someone named White.

13:03.985 --> 13:06.219
White Josh. Yeah,
sorry, that was a typo.

13:06.221 --> 13:07.420
You have got to meet him.

13:07.422 --> 13:09.822
You would love him and
it would break your heart

13:09.824 --> 13:11.561
to think he might never father a child.

13:11.586 --> 13:13.293
I'm gonna just stop you.

13:13.295 --> 13:16.296
Um, since we're coworkers,
we probably shouldn't be

13:16.298 --> 13:18.064
discussing personal matters so much.

13:18.066 --> 13:19.265
But if it helps,

13:19.267 --> 13:21.401
I just read a review of
a book on relationships

13:21.403 --> 13:22.635
in The New York Times.

13:22.637 --> 13:24.537
I'm happy to send you a link.

13:24.539 --> 13:25.872
You would do that for me?

13:25.874 --> 13:27.241
You would send me a link

13:27.266 --> 13:30.134
to pertinent literature
that I could read?

13:30.971 --> 13:32.945
Maya. Maya.

13:32.947 --> 13:34.736
I also can't even couldn't.

Hey.

13:36.384 --> 13:38.151
Oh. Sorry.

13:38.153 --> 13:39.552
I'm such a klutz.

13:39.554 --> 13:41.187
It's okay.

13:41.418 --> 13:43.189
Oh, sesquipedalian.

13:43.191 --> 13:44.691
I know what that means.

13:44.693 --> 13:46.192
It means polysyllabic.

13:46.194 --> 13:47.960
That's not even mine.

13:47.962 --> 13:49.462
I was gonna recycle it.

13:49.464 --> 13:51.450
- Do you want it?
- A gift?

13:51.900 --> 13:53.166

Oh, no, it's fine.

14:12.862 --> 14:14.554
I'm not usually this popular.

14:14.556 --> 14:16.456
And downtown, everyone is so formal.

14:16.458 --> 14:18.257
We mostly communicate via fax.

14:18.259 --> 14:19.492
Which reminds me,

14:19.494 --> 14:21.728
I have to send off these documents.

14:24.466 --> 14:26.366
Work, work, work. Love that.

Becca.

14:37.956 --> 14:39.322
Hmm?

14:39.481 --> 14:41.080
Hello.

14:41.082 --> 14:42.715
Hmm.

14:42.717 --> 14:44.117
Hello.

14:44.119 --> 14:45.451
How long was I asleep?

14:45.453 --> 14:46.814
A long time.

14:47.389 --> 14:49.122
You must be really tired, I guess.

14:49.124 --> 14:50.390
Hmm.

14:50.392 --> 14:51.541
You feeling better?

14:51.566 --> 14:53.166
Not really.

14:53.492 --> 14:56.257
I kind of just want to
go back to sleep forever.

14:58.166 --> 15:00.171
- What's that?
- This?

15:00.196 --> 15:02.263
It's for you. It's a
strawberry milkshake.

15:02.827 --> 15:07.273
Ugh, is that some sort of,
like, fat-free, dairy-free,

15:07.275 --> 15:08.574
80-calorie blorch?

15:08.576 --> 15:11.144
No, honey. I made it
with real ice cream.

15:11.146 --> 15:12.612
You haven't eaten in a few days

15:12.795 --> 15:14.747
and, well, I know you love shakes.

15:15.670 --> 15:17.194
Okay.

15:18.119 --> 15:19.519
Thank you, I guess.

15:19.521 --> 15:20.853
You gonna try it?

15:21.725 --> 15:23.289
This is the first time in my life

15:23.291 --> 15:25.091
you've ever encouraged me to eat.

15:25.093 --> 15:26.859
Okay, if you don't want it,
you don't have to have it.

15:26.861 --> 15:28.357
No. No, I'll try it.

15:34.865 --> 15:37.795
- This is not bad.
- Enjoy.

15:46.163 --> 15:48.014
I like your walk.
Heel-toe, heel-toe.

15:48.016 --> 15:49.315
What a stride.

15:49.317 --> 15:52.251
I have a tendency to pronate,
so I try to walk evenly.

15:52.253 --> 15:55.588
Love it. Ugh. Amazing. Gold. Queen.

15:55.590 --> 15:57.093
Sorry, I have to file these.

15:57.118 --> 15:59.058
Hey, so, um, this weekend,

15:59.060 --> 16:00.960
I'm doing a vagina refresh seminar.

16:00.962 --> 16:02.228
We sun her, we steam her,

16:02.230 --> 16:04.096
we put crystals in her.

16:04.098 --> 16:05.832
I bought two tickets.
Are you interested?

16:06.316 --> 16:08.601
No, thank you. I'm busy.

16:08.603 --> 16:10.536
Oh, okay. Well, maybe next time.

16:10.787 --> 16:12.269
Maybe.

16:15.243 --> 16:18.176
Cornelia, this book is incredible.

16:18.347 --> 16:21.013
I have a pathological need for approval

16:21.015 --> 16:23.416
that prevents me from
engaging in conflict.

16:23.418 --> 16:25.514
You should be a
therapist. You're spot-on.

16:25.539 --> 16:28.090
I didn't say that. And
I didn't read the book,

16:28.115 --> 16:29.975
but okay.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.058
I think my issues stem from my father

16:32.060 --> 16:34.045
because he said that I
had an ugly upper lip,

16:34.436 --> 16:36.963
which is why I hide behind
this luxuriant mustache.

16:36.965 --> 16:38.898
Oh, feel it, feel it. It's amazing.

16:38.900 --> 16:40.032
No, thank you.

16:40.034 --> 16:41.467
Some other time.

16:41.469 --> 16:43.236
Ooh.

16:47.642 --> 16:48.582
We're dancing.

16:48.607 --> 16:51.043
Stand still, please, and
I will walk around you.

16:51.566 --> 16:52.778
Thank you.

16:55.183 --> 16:56.832
Oh, us.

17:01.985 --> 17:05.258
Here is the second draft of
the brief for the time-share.

17:05.260 --> 17:06.392
Second?

17:06.823 --> 17:09.384
The first draft was
excellent, very, very smart.

17:10.156 --> 17:11.964
You work so diligently.

17:11.965 --> 17:13.332
That's what you pay me for.

17:13.334 --> 17:16.002
You show up on time, you
haven't thrown anything at me.

17:16.003 --> 17:17.203
Haven't seen you compress

17:17.204 --> 17:19.955
a donut into a tiny ball
and swallow it whole.

17:20.108 --> 17:21.073
And you appear to have

17:21.075 --> 17:22.842
no interest in whimsical trips to Rome.

17:22.844 --> 17:25.823
Can't dispute those very specific facts.

17:26.114 --> 17:27.445
What school did you go to again?

17:27.448 --> 17:28.581
Yale and Harvard,

17:28.583 --> 17:31.050
but I never mention
it unless someone asks.

17:31.052 --> 17:33.886
Wow.

17:33.888 --> 17:36.222
You are a breath of fresh air, Cornelia.

17:36.224 --> 17:37.523
Thank you, sir.

17:37.525 --> 17:39.592
- I'll get back to work.
- Okay.

17:45.533 --> 17:48.734
Ah.

17:48.736 --> 17:50.036
Bop, you're the princess. Boom.

17:50.038 --> 17:51.137
Wait, why are you bopping Brendan?

17:51.139 --> 17:53.072
I totally have more
fairy dust than he does.

17:53.074 --> 17:54.407
Oh!

17:54.409 --> 17:56.742
Boom. Sucks to be you. That makes me

17:56.744 --> 17:59.146
the pixie princess, bitches.

17:59.380 --> 18:01.113
Now give me all your gumdrops.

18:01.115 --> 18:03.049
I'm heading to the frosty cotillion.

18:03.051 --> 18:04.183
Thank you, thanks.

18:04.185 --> 18:05.351
Wait, can we just do this again?

18:05.353 --> 18:07.802
I totally messed up at
the Rainbow Rainforest.

18:07.827 --> 18:11.257
You guys, this is really fun.

18:11.259 --> 18:13.492
Thank you.

18:14.418 --> 18:15.582
- Let's just...
- Roll, roll.

18:15.607 --> 18:16.606
Okay.

18:17.605 --> 18:19.632
Seven-letter word,

18:19.634 --> 18:23.613
second letter "U," blank... tension.

18:23.682 --> 18:25.066
What could this be?

18:27.113 --> 18:28.613
Surface?

18:28.638 --> 18:30.171
Surface tension?

18:32.165 --> 18:34.614
"S-U-R-F-A-C... "
Yes.

18:34.616 --> 18:36.082
Yes, it fits.

18:36.084 --> 18:37.950
- It fits.
- Mm.

18:37.952 --> 18:39.876
It works with 15 down, Esai Morales.

18:39.901 --> 18:41.554
Oh, well, it's always Esai Morales.

18:41.556 --> 18:42.688
I know, it is.

18:42.690 --> 18:43.689
It is.

18:43.691 --> 18:45.558
Get over here, smarty pants.

18:45.790 --> 18:47.727
I'm gonna need help with 17 down.

18:47.729 --> 18:49.829
It's a science thing. You know
I know bupkes about science.

18:49.901 --> 18:51.267
And you're so good at it.

18:54.972 --> 18:57.403
You sure you don't need
to be doing whatever it is

18:57.405 --> 19:00.011
that you... have been
doing on the computer?

19:02.294 --> 19:03.994
Not right now, no.

19:04.145 --> 19:05.378
Okay.

19:05.380 --> 19:08.702
So... 17 down.

19:16.703 --> 19:19.437
It was a silly idea. You don't have
to do it if you don't want to.

19:19.462 --> 19:21.342
I don't have to, I want to.

19:21.367 --> 19:23.267
You know, I'm sorry
I never tried these on

19:23.269 --> 19:25.135
when you bought them for us in 2004.

19:27.071 --> 19:28.405
I was having a fat year.

19:28.407 --> 19:30.107
I thought my ass looked
like a watermelon.

19:30.109 --> 19:32.443
Yeah, well, you look great.

19:32.445 --> 19:33.399
Thank you.

19:33.424 --> 19:36.113
Mmm.

19:36.115 --> 19:38.282
God, these are so delicious. It's funny.

19:38.284 --> 19:39.883
The cold kind of gives
my head a buzzy feeling

19:39.885 --> 19:41.085
and my ears are ringing a little bit.

19:41.087 --> 19:42.686
Yeah, me, too. Same thing happens to me

19:42.688 --> 19:44.388
whenever I have a cold
shake. Brain freeze.

19:44.390 --> 19:45.789
Brain freeze. Right.

19:47.901 --> 19:49.460
Why are you being so nice to me?

19:49.462 --> 19:51.528
What do you mean? I'm always nice.

19:51.530 --> 19:52.963
Not really.

19:53.463 --> 19:55.065
I am your mother.

19:55.067 --> 19:56.600
I can see that you need me.

19:56.602 --> 19:57.968
You need a little TLC.

19:58.572 --> 20:01.638
Okay, well, thank you.

20:01.640 --> 20:04.141
Of course. Now, you
haven't had any solid food,

20:04.143 --> 20:05.442
so let me make you something.

20:05.444 --> 20:06.844
How about popcorn?

20:06.846 --> 20:07.945
Let me make you popcorn.

20:07.947 --> 20:09.246
That would go great with your shake.

20:09.248 --> 20:10.714
Yeah, that would be great.

20:10.716 --> 20:11.982
Okay.

Oh, well, then I'm

Oh, I made you a taco casserole.

23:24.072 --> 23:26.110

You must just want to die.

23:35.556 --> 23:37.689
Actually, I don't.

23:38.142 --> 23:40.058
Because my mother and I
are getting along very well.

23:40.060 --> 23:41.125
So, bye...

23:41.127 --> 23:42.493
Getting along with Naomi?

23:42.495 --> 23:44.729
Where's her body? 
Sorry, is that Twister?

23:44.731 --> 23:47.094
Yeah. You know what,
Audra, it's Twister.

23:47.119 --> 23:49.367
My mother and I are about
to play a trust-building game

23:49.369 --> 23:51.194
of physical skill and fun.

23:51.219 --> 23:53.705
Everything's different
now. My mother accepts me.

23:53.707 --> 23:56.076
Yeah, right. Of course.

23:56.101 --> 23:58.342
'Cause what do opinionated
Jewish mothers do

23:58.344 --> 23:59.577
when they turn 60?

23:59.579 --> 24:01.646
They change.

24:01.648 --> 24:05.183
Tell me, what did you do
to earn this miraculous

24:05.185 --> 24:06.984
acceptance from your mother?

24:06.986 --> 24:08.119
I'm curious.

24:08.121 --> 24:11.055
Well, I got sad and came home,

24:11.057 --> 24:12.757
and refused to shower,
and stayed up all night,

24:12.759 --> 24:14.792
and she felt sad for me, and
now she's taking care of me.

24:15.892 --> 24:17.929
Yeah, you're a smart girl.

24:17.931 --> 24:19.230
That doesn't make any sense.

24:20.040 --> 24:21.666
This thing smells from knee sweat,

24:21.668 --> 24:23.000
and now I got some gas.

24:23.002 --> 24:24.796
You're welcome.

24:25.305 --> 24:26.604
Audra.

24:26.606 --> 24:28.206
Audra Levine.

24:28.208 --> 24:29.841
- Hello.
- Whoa.

24:30.186 --> 24:32.977
Wonderful to see you.

24:32.979 --> 24:34.812
Will you be staying for some board games

24:34.814 --> 24:36.280
and some ice cream, honey?

24:37.319 --> 24:39.350
Okay, I don't know what this is,

24:39.352 --> 24:40.551
but it's scary.

24:40.553 --> 24:42.923
And I'm not sticking
around for the murder-Sui.

24:43.267 --> 24:45.223
Rebecca, she's up to something.

24:45.225 --> 24:47.925
And if you don't know what
it is, then it's working.

24:48.532 --> 24:49.527
Bye, Naomi.

24:49.529 --> 24:51.290
Bye, Audra.

24:51.931 --> 24:53.965
- Have a great day.
- Mm-hmm.

24:54.834 --> 24:57.802
What a bitch. Up to something?
You know what I'm up to?

24:57.804 --> 24:59.504
I'm up to whuppin' your
tuchus in that game.

24:59.506 --> 25:00.738
That's what I'm up to.

25:00.740 --> 25:03.544
And before we start, you need some fuel.

25:04.161 --> 25:06.106
How about another shake, stat?

25:07.067 --> 25:08.980
Okay.

25:17.312 --> 25:19.245
I'm gonna miss you guys at work today.

25:19.878 --> 25:22.679
Ugh, I am not looking
forward to it anyway.

25:23.096 --> 25:26.597
It's gonna be tough not
seeing Rebecca at her desk.

25:26.599 --> 25:27.765
Then don't.

25:27.767 --> 25:30.080
Just call in sick for
the rest of the week.

25:31.240 --> 25:33.139
That's a great idea.

25:33.291 --> 25:35.540
We could actually go on a vacation.

25:35.542 --> 25:37.074
You call in sick, too.

25:37.076 --> 25:38.509
What? No.

25:38.511 --> 25:39.677
Yeah. Come on.

25:39.679 --> 25:41.012
It'll get my mind off Rebecca.

25:41.468 --> 25:42.947
And I am working on a case

25:42.949 --> 25:45.383
with a time-share
company in Palm Springs,

25:45.385 --> 25:46.918
and they love me.

25:46.920 --> 25:49.954
And they said anytime
that I wanted to stay,

25:49.956 --> 25:52.390
all I had to do was e-mail and go.

25:52.392 --> 25:53.616
I've seen pictures.

25:53.641 --> 25:56.358
They got a nice pool area
with a swim-up bar.

25:56.383 --> 25:58.129
Tommy does love a swim-up bar.

25:58.131 --> 26:00.097
He loves to drink while he pees.

26:00.900 --> 26:04.035
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

26:07.540 --> 26:10.308
Hey, Corns? Sit with me.

26:10.310 --> 26:12.710
'Neelia. 'Neelia, I got dark chocolate.

26:12.712 --> 26:14.212
Look at, dark chocolate.

26:14.382 --> 26:16.113
Thought we could ironically
read our horoscopes

26:16.115 --> 26:18.349
and talk about how shallow
everyone in the office is.

26:18.351 --> 26:20.318
Thanks, everyone.

26:20.320 --> 26:22.888
I'm just waiting for my burrito,

26:22.913 --> 26:24.889
and then I have some stuff to look at

26:24.891 --> 26:26.953
on my... phone.

26:27.804 --> 26:29.460
I'll stand here.

26:30.230 --> 26:32.250
See what you guys are doing?
You're creeping her out.

26:32.275 --> 26:34.832
That's sexist. You're trying
to silence our sisterhood.

26:34.834 --> 26:36.334
Right, Neels-on-Wheels?

26:36.820 --> 26:39.164
I know, right?

26:39.973 --> 26:42.874
- I didn't say anything.
- Didn't have to.

26:45.044 --> 26:46.644
- Want to chat?
- Ow! No.

26:46.646 --> 26:48.279
- I'm just make a burrito...
- Sorry.

26:48.281 --> 26:49.714
... to eat while I work.

26:49.716 --> 26:50.615
You're hurting her!

26:50.617 --> 26:51.816
I'm okay, I'm not hurt.

26:51.818 --> 26:52.884
Is that still frozen?

26:52.886 --> 26:54.619
Uh, yeah, I like it that way.

26:54.621 --> 26:56.341
I'm, um, I'm teething.

27:02.072 --> 27:03.672
I'm sorry, I saw that.

27:04.200 --> 27:05.663
You're really getting bombarded.

27:05.665 --> 27:07.498
Permission to speak freely?

27:07.500 --> 27:10.568
- Granted.
- Well, I like how friendly everyone is,

27:10.570 --> 27:13.371
but it's getting to
be, pardon my language,

27:13.373 --> 27:14.839
a bit much.

27:14.841 --> 27:16.484
They're freaks. Tell you what.

27:16.509 --> 27:18.712
I have to go to Palm Springs
for another time-share meeting.

27:18.737 --> 27:20.003
You want to come with?

27:20.513 --> 27:23.614
- They're not going, are they?
- Absolutely not.

27:23.616 --> 27:24.949
Oh, God, look at them.

27:25.318 --> 27:27.285
Yes, let's go, please.

Yeah, Mom, I'm fine.

aquatic recreation center.

28:34.460 --> 28:36.661
Mr. Robertson almost
took a trip to Brazil,

28:36.686 --> 28:39.053
but he didn't, because
he's afraid to fly.

28:39.055 --> 28:41.422
But he looked up some images online,

28:41.424 --> 28:43.807
and he was inspired to create this.

28:44.373 --> 28:46.827
This pool, in particular,
is his passion project,

28:46.829 --> 28:49.158
and he's very upset about being sued.

28:49.533 --> 28:50.898
When he advertised

28:50.900 --> 28:52.666
mountain views from the swim-up bar,

28:52.668 --> 28:54.268
he didn't realize there weren't any,

28:54.270 --> 28:55.836
because he's also afraid to swim.

28:55.838 --> 28:58.606
Are you sure there are no
mountain views from the bar?

28:58.608 --> 29:01.108
You know what, it's
hard to tell from here.

29:01.110 --> 29:03.244
I think I see a peak
between those buildings.

29:03.246 --> 29:05.613
Yeah, I see that, too.
Although, the closer we get to the bar,

29:05.615 --> 29:07.314
the more obstructed the view is.

29:07.316 --> 29:10.206
I think we need to get a
photo from the swim-up bar.

29:10.486 --> 29:11.819
- Yes.
- You know what?

29:11.821 --> 29:13.287
I have a swimsuit in my car.

29:13.289 --> 29:14.885
I'll just hop in and do it.
You wait here.

29:14.910 --> 29:17.096
Sir, you shouldn't
have to get in the pool.

29:17.260 --> 29:19.326
I'll grab a suit from the
gift shop and take care of it.

29:19.328 --> 29:20.405

29:37.705 --> 29:39.713
I mean, I love those people, I do,

29:39.715 --> 29:41.515
but, dear God,

29:41.682 --> 29:44.552
what a bunch of needy misfits.

29:44.554 --> 29:45.768
Ooh.

29:49.296 --> 29:50.994
Ah...

29:58.689 --> 30:02.798
- Oh, God!
- Honey?

30:05.713 --> 30:07.975
Oh... that is my boss.

30:08.197 --> 30:10.044
I called in sick... I don't
want him to see me and...

30:10.046 --> 30:12.807
Wait, who is that woman?

30:13.182 --> 30:14.915
What is going on?

30:14.917 --> 30:17.088
Oh, I don't know.

30:17.486 --> 30:19.502
That woman walks very evenly.

30:20.322 --> 30:23.122
She must have a tendency to pronate.

30:26.283 --> 30:27.995
If you're standing here,

30:27.997 --> 30:30.297
there's technically a bit of a view.

30:30.299 --> 30:33.500
- Right here, if you lean over.
- Great.

30:34.829 --> 30:36.562
You are so professional.

30:36.759 --> 30:38.826
Even in a swim-up bar. It's amazing.

30:39.008 --> 30:40.074
I'm sorry?

30:40.076 --> 30:41.410
Well, it's just that...

30:42.111 --> 30:43.978
some people in your position

30:43.980 --> 30:45.519
would behave differently.

30:45.855 --> 30:48.248
Some people, who I
definitely don't think about

30:48.250 --> 30:50.421
or talk about at all anymore,

30:50.620 --> 30:52.486
they would not have
gone into that gift shop

30:52.488 --> 30:55.022
and selected a conservative
one-piece, like you did.

30:55.024 --> 30:57.524
They would have picked
out a ridiculous bikini,

30:57.526 --> 30:59.468
and they'd be slinging their
boobs all over the place.

30:59.493 --> 31:01.962
- I'm sorry, what?
- And they'd be provoking me

31:01.964 --> 31:04.929
and zinging me and
challenging my world view.

31:06.002 --> 31:07.733
And warming my heart...

31:10.039 --> 31:12.303
Thank God that's not happening.

31:12.575 --> 31:14.675
Thank God I don't have
that in my life anymore.

31:19.139 --> 31:20.481
I'm sorry.

31:20.483 --> 31:22.725
I'm not crying. I'm not crying.

31:23.285 --> 31:25.357
It's just the chlorine
in this water is...

31:26.435 --> 31:30.443
Oh, sir, you're okay.

31:30.723 --> 31:33.057
I mean, I think you're okay.

31:33.121 --> 31:34.954
I don't know what's going on.

31:35.006 --> 31:36.764
You're crying, and
I'm in a bathing suit.

31:36.766 --> 31:38.098
How did this happen?

31:40.202 --> 31:43.070
Becky? I was thinking we
could do each other's toes.

31:43.072 --> 31:44.238
You've been drugging me.

31:46.254 --> 31:48.842
Oh, this makes so much sense, of course.

31:49.410 --> 31:51.434
Of course you didn't change.

31:52.551 --> 31:54.782
The only reason I was feeling
better is 'cause you gave me

31:54.784 --> 31:59.348
these drugs... that blitzed me
out and made my ears buzz.

31:59.373 --> 32:02.254
I had no choice. I
saw all your websites.

32:02.511 --> 32:04.892
Your suicide websites.

32:04.894 --> 32:06.193
I had to do something.

32:06.195 --> 32:08.429
So you gave me medication
without my consent?

32:08.431 --> 32:11.910
Lest you forget, young lady, we
have been through this before.

32:11.944 --> 32:13.911
That suicide attempt in college,

32:13.936 --> 32:16.403
and then you tried to
burn down someone's house.

32:16.405 --> 32:17.838
And each time, you refused help,

32:17.840 --> 32:19.073
so, yes, yes,

32:19.075 --> 32:21.475
I decided to give you
some of the anxiety pills

32:21.477 --> 32:23.477
that the doctor gave me
for the High Holidays.

32:23.479 --> 32:26.180
I just wanted to calm
you down so we could talk

32:26.182 --> 32:28.975
and I could convince
you to go away somewhere.

32:29.326 --> 32:31.919
Commit me?

32:31.921 --> 32:34.021
I'm sorry, you wanted to commit me?

32:34.023 --> 32:35.689
That is such a dramatic word.

32:36.975 --> 32:39.359
You made me think that you loved me.

32:40.990 --> 32:43.257
You gave me hope when I had none.

32:46.458 --> 32:48.291
And now that hope is gone.

32:48.402 --> 32:49.935
I do love you.

32:50.039 --> 32:52.372
- I'm just trying to help you.
- Help?

32:52.374 --> 32:54.174
You were never any help.

32:54.880 --> 32:56.513
Rebecca...

32:56.877 --> 32:58.979
Rebecca, wait!

32:59.410 --> 33:01.582
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

33:01.584 --> 33:03.550
I shouldn't be talking about this.

33:03.552 --> 33:05.552
It's just that I've been going
through a lot lately because...

33:05.554 --> 33:06.587
You know what?

33:06.589 --> 33:07.888
Don't tell me, okay?

33:07.890 --> 33:10.190
I think it's best if
we just call it a day

33:10.192 --> 33:11.759
and go back to the office.

33:11.761 --> 33:12.826
Corns!

33:12.828 --> 33:13.927
Neels!

33:13.929 --> 33:15.162
Yaya!

33:15.164 --> 33:16.363
Oh, God,

33:16.365 --> 33:18.157
these jack-holes.

33:18.182 --> 33:19.710
So that's your boss, Mom?

33:19.735 --> 33:21.368
And all of your coworkers?

33:21.370 --> 33:23.836
- Ee-yep.
- Very cool.

33:25.165 --> 33:27.040
Why are you all here?

33:27.042 --> 33:28.642
Well, you know, we never circled back

33:28.644 --> 33:30.944
about that conversation we
had about my relationship.

33:30.946 --> 33:33.046
And I followed you and
then they followed me,

33:33.048 --> 33:35.713
like the psychopaths that
they are. And here we are.

33:35.738 --> 33:38.452
I called dibs on talking to
you first, because I'm a woman,

33:38.454 --> 33:40.287
but they don't respect women or dibs.

33:40.289 --> 33:41.722
Cornelia, let's blow this joint,

33:41.724 --> 33:44.892
go into town, try on some
vintage bowling shirts to music.

33:44.894 --> 33:47.594
Dude, stop. She has three
children and a husband.

33:47.596 --> 33:48.962
But does he make you laugh?

33:48.964 --> 33:51.331
Cornelia, ignore him,
ignore both of them.

33:51.333 --> 33:52.566
You like me the most, right?

33:52.568 --> 33:54.968
I mean,
you and I have a bond, right?

33:54.970 --> 33:57.326
- We have a sisterhood.
- We have a... oh, what is this?

33:57.351 --> 33:59.807
Pick me! Pick me, Cornelia, pick me!

33:59.809 --> 34:01.562
You like me best. You like
me best, I know you do!

34:01.587 --> 34:02.470
No, I nominate me.

34:02.495 --> 34:04.244
No, honestly, you have
a connection with me.

34:04.246 --> 34:05.349
Like a therapy session
that I've never...

34:05.374 --> 34:06.346
I told you all
not to follow me.

34:07.416 --> 34:08.815
There's a very good chance...

34:08.818 --> 34:09.882

to file several HR complaints.

I look forward to
collecting a settlement

35:20.489 --> 35:23.790
and finally opening up

35:23.792 --> 35:26.526
You guys... are a mess.

35:26.621 --> 35:28.310
Bye!

35:29.677 --> 35:31.444
Have you been crying?

35:32.424 --> 35:33.834
Your eyes are all red.

35:33.836 --> 35:34.935
Oh, yeah.

35:34.937 --> 35:38.038
What the hell... is going on?

35:38.770 --> 35:40.536
I take one vacation!

35:41.510 --> 35:45.112
And, Jim, you... are ripped.

35:45.114 --> 35:48.181
- It's just protein shakes.
- Nice. They're working.

35:48.916 --> 35:50.248
Becky?

35:50.352 --> 35:51.783
Where are you?

35:53.088 --> 35:54.388
Rebecca Nora Bunch!

35:54.413 --> 35:56.613
Did you crawl out of
a window or something?

35:58.331 --> 36:00.397
Where did she go?

36:06.846 --> 36:10.470
- _
- What?

36:20.647 --> 36:23.504
Excuse me, miss? Are you okay?

36:26.889 --> 36:28.466
I don't know.

36:33.719 --> 36:37.771
Man, I take one fake
vacation for a few days

36:37.796 --> 36:40.663
and you guys lose your minds.

36:41.875 --> 36:44.210
- That poor woman.
- Yeah, I know.

36:44.235 --> 36:47.845
The thing is, Cornelia
reminded me of Rebecca.

36:47.847 --> 36:49.514
Reminded all of us of Rebecca.

36:49.516 --> 36:51.916
Not me. To me, she was 
the opposite of Rebecca,

36:51.918 --> 36:54.031
which only made me miss her even more.

36:54.056 --> 36:57.635
Look, we love her. We always will.

36:57.660 --> 37:01.429
But we have got to move on.

37:02.155 --> 37:04.762
She's got her life, we have ours.

37:04.764 --> 37:08.132
And maybe that has
just got to be enough.

37:08.134 --> 37:09.634
You're right.

37:10.077 --> 37:12.203
White Josh and I have got to
deal with our relationship.

37:12.205 --> 37:14.640
I'm gonna call him, I'm
gonna take him to a yurt,

37:14.757 --> 37:16.941
we're gonna take some
ayahuasca and figure it out,

37:16.943 --> 37:19.177
no matter how long it takes.

37:19.179 --> 37:20.511
Thank you, Paula.

37:27.691 --> 37:30.982
- It's not gonna be easy without her.
- Yeah.

37:32.701 --> 37:34.034
You okay?

37:36.362 --> 37:38.168
No, but I will be.

37:39.299 --> 37:43.980
I just hope, wherever
she is, she's happy.

37:46.621 --> 37:48.535
Actually, yeah, you can help me.

37:49.433 --> 37:51.409
This is gonna sound a
little crazy, but, um,

37:51.411 --> 37:52.777
I-I need to get off the plane.

37:52.779 --> 37:55.413
I bought a ticket to go to
L.A. when I was in New York.

37:55.415 --> 37:57.014
But I'm just remembering now,

37:57.016 --> 37:59.717
that everyone in L.A. either hates me

37:59.719 --> 38:01.808
and/or thinks I'm crazy, so,

38:01.833 --> 38:04.222
New York isn't my home,
but L.A. isn't either.

38:04.224 --> 38:06.224
So, all I need you to do,

38:06.226 --> 38:10.128
is just drop me off
in, like, Ohio or Idaho?

38:10.130 --> 38:11.229
In a cornfield somewhere.

38:11.231 --> 38:12.363
Sorry, hon.

38:12.365 --> 38:13.831
We really can't just drop people off.

38:13.833 --> 38:16.711
But you can get off the plane
in L.A. and buy a new ticket.

38:17.132 --> 38:18.836
True, true.

38:18.838 --> 38:19.992
Yeah.

38:20.306 --> 38:21.906
The thing is, I'm just too tired

38:21.908 --> 38:25.076
to... buy things or do
things or get things

38:25.078 --> 38:26.811
or say things or face things.

38:27.039 --> 38:31.616
Tell you what, we have
a Merlot that is...

38:31.618 --> 38:33.384
