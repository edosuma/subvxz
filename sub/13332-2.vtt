WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:07.040 --> 00:09.008
Newcastle, done.

00:09.075 --> 00:10.310
Cancun, done.

00:11.211 --> 00:14.013
Australia, guess what,
you're getting done.

00:14.080 --> 00:16.916
The Geordies are going Down Under.
To Australia!

00:16.983 --> 00:19.953
And deep into the bush.
Look out! (all scream)

00:21.888 --> 00:24.290
Throw another shrimp on the barbie!

00:25.692 --> 00:27.494
This one's gonna be the best yet.

00:29.529 --> 00:31.264
This is a fucking war.

00:33.933 --> 00:36.002
I've met someone
I really care about.

00:36.069 --> 00:39.739
I'm banging a bird
in Charlotte's future bed.

00:39.806 --> 00:40.840
Hello!

00:41.708 --> 00:44.077
I'm single. Back to the old Vicky.

00:44.144 --> 00:47.080
Let's see who can get
down under first.

00:49.749 --> 00:52.385
The next thing I know,
I'm getting escorted out.

00:52.452 --> 00:55.488
That means one thing.
Holly's lost her place in the house.

00:55.555 --> 00:58.057
(screams) The window!

00:58.124 --> 01:02.429
I'm back in the fucking Geordie
Shore house and I'm fucking mortal.

01:02.495 --> 01:03.563
(screams)

01:05.265 --> 01:07.467
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

01:07.534 --> 01:09.602
I am a Geordie girl with a VIP edge.

01:09.669 --> 01:11.704
I'd never kiss a guy
without a six pack.

01:11.771 --> 01:13.640
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:13.706 --> 01:15.775
I could talk the back legs
off a donkey.

01:15.842 --> 01:18.645
I'm fit, I'm flirty
and I've got FFs.

01:18.711 --> 01:20.647
The hardest graft I do is me hair.

01:20.713 --> 01:22.949
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

01:32.091 --> 01:33.326
Welcome back, Jay.

01:33.393 --> 01:35.128
Guess what, I'm back.

01:35.195 --> 01:37.263
(all) To Jay!

01:37.330 --> 01:39.132
Jay being here just feels right.

01:39.199 --> 01:42.302
It feels like that missing piece
to the puzzle.

01:42.368 --> 01:44.137
It feels like we're a family.

01:44.204 --> 01:48.041
# Let's get fucking mortal
Na, na, na, na, Jay! #

01:48.107 --> 01:50.210
(Sophie) Go on, Jay lad.

01:50.276 --> 01:51.744
(Charlotte) Go on, Jay!

01:51.811 --> 01:55.715
Jay's my best mate. I can tell when
that kid is absolutely smashed.

01:57.450 --> 02:00.420
He will not remember
this conversation at all.

02:00.487 --> 02:02.755
Wahey! (laughs)

02:05.558 --> 02:06.860
I'm hoping to see Holly.

02:06.926 --> 02:08.928
I know that she's been kicked out.

02:08.995 --> 02:11.164
Something to do with James,
God knows.

02:11.231 --> 02:13.800
Same old, same old
in this fucking house.

02:13.867 --> 02:15.401
It's like a dream come true.

02:15.468 --> 02:18.238
The psycho's gone
and one of the lads is back.

02:18.304 --> 02:19.706
Absolutely buzzing.

02:21.774 --> 02:26.246
# Let's get fucking mortal
Let's get fucking mortal #

02:39.993 --> 02:42.562
I wake up
with a renewed sense of vigour.

02:42.629 --> 02:44.697
I went through such a huge break up.

02:44.764 --> 02:46.733
I'm just gonna relax, have fun,

02:46.799 --> 02:49.869
and if tashing happens,
tashing happens.

02:52.972 --> 02:58.344
I woke up this morning and I didn't
have a fucking clue where I was at.

02:58.411 --> 03:00.480
Happy birthday!

03:00.547 --> 03:03.416
Today is Jay's birthday
and it's his third birthday

03:03.483 --> 03:05.051
in the Geordie Shore house.

03:05.118 --> 03:06.853
He's came in on his birthday.

03:06.920 --> 03:10.523
We need to plan something for today,
but definitely for tonight.

03:10.590 --> 03:12.825
I am literally here for three days

03:12.892 --> 03:15.562
and all I am here for is to party.

03:15.628 --> 03:17.163
(Sophie) What youse doing?

03:17.230 --> 03:19.799
We're going for a chuckle.
Are you going in? Aye.

03:21.401 --> 03:22.602
(screams)

03:22.669 --> 03:24.237
It's fucking pissing down.

03:24.304 --> 03:27.607
It's probably better weather
back in fucking Newcastle.

03:30.343 --> 03:32.211
Me and Gary are having a carry on

03:32.278 --> 03:35.214
but I want to get on with him
so there's no atmosphere.

03:35.281 --> 03:36.616
Really I'm dead inside.

03:37.951 --> 03:39.619
It was so weird Jay coming back

03:39.686 --> 03:41.888
and seeing me and Charlotte.

03:41.955 --> 03:44.290
We're not flirting any more.

03:44.357 --> 03:46.526
All he's ever known is that.

03:48.962 --> 03:52.565
Everyone's so happy and I'm
absolutely buzzing Jay's here.

03:52.632 --> 03:54.033
I just hope it lasts.

04:14.454 --> 04:17.656
It's Jay's birthday. What better way
to spend your birthday

04:17.724 --> 04:20.059
than on Bondi Beach,
surfing, few drinks.

04:20.125 --> 04:21.694
It doesn't get any better.

04:31.871 --> 04:33.940
Can you not just stay
for a bit longer?

04:34.007 --> 04:37.043
Come on, just stay here for
another three weeks. I can't.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.746
He's in the same position as me.
He's got a bird,

04:39.812 --> 04:42.315
but he wants to go out
and have a good time.

04:45.551 --> 04:47.987
You cheeky bastard,
do you know what I mean?

04:48.054 --> 04:52.225
It's hard for him to gel
with Gary and Scott

04:52.291 --> 04:56.329
when all they're doing
is talking about banging birds.

04:56.396 --> 04:58.965
I bet it's a fucking nightmare
sometimes.

04:59.032 --> 05:02.135
Sometimes it is, like.
You just fucking get left.

05:02.201 --> 05:04.303
Would you like a Corona, boys?

05:04.370 --> 05:07.373
Yes.
Right up my street. Cheers.

05:07.440 --> 05:10.043
You pulling tonight, son?
Aye, fucking right.

05:10.109 --> 05:12.945
Me and him fucking been cleaning up.

05:19.452 --> 05:24.290
We're going to the reptile park
because I wanna see some locals.

05:24.357 --> 05:26.626
Local animals that is.

05:29.629 --> 05:32.098
(Vicky) What the fuck is that?

05:32.165 --> 05:33.766
These are emus, guys.

05:33.833 --> 05:38.171
There's these emus.
They look like old ladies.

05:38.237 --> 05:40.039
Their faces are so angry.

05:40.106 --> 05:42.775
(Charlotte screeches)
Charlotte, shush.

05:42.842 --> 05:44.811
I fucking hate emus.

05:44.877 --> 05:46.012
(screams)

05:46.079 --> 05:49.182
There's a notable absence.
Holly's still not back.

05:49.248 --> 05:51.884
Why is it always raining
in Australia by the way?

05:51.951 --> 05:52.952
Don't know.

05:55.688 --> 05:59.325
Gary and Scott weren't bothered.
They just shagged the girls.

05:59.392 --> 06:01.661
The girls came down
while Gary lay in bed.

06:01.728 --> 06:03.896
I don't know what's happened
to Scott,

06:03.963 --> 06:06.766
but he's got more and more obsessive
with pulling

06:06.833 --> 06:10.336
and even more obsessive
with beating Gary at pulling.

06:10.403 --> 06:13.740
It never ceases to amaze me
just how far they'll go

06:13.806 --> 06:16.142
for a nameless, faceless bang.

06:16.209 --> 06:20.012
There is a deep-seated competition
going on between those two lads.

06:20.079 --> 06:23.449
And what they've got isn't
a friendship, it's a competition.

06:23.516 --> 06:26.385
It's sad, it's just nothing new now.
I'm bored of it.

06:26.452 --> 06:29.288
Gary wants to be the only lad
in the house

06:29.355 --> 06:33.760
and Scott's came in threatening
his lad title. He hates it.

06:33.826 --> 06:36.362
How different can sex be?

06:36.429 --> 06:39.132
How different can a vagina be?
Very.

06:39.198 --> 06:40.800
Really? Mm.
Yeah. Whoa.

06:46.639 --> 06:48.341
(all toast)

06:48.407 --> 06:52.245
It's me third birthday
in the Geordie Shore house.

06:52.311 --> 06:54.413
(housemates cheer)

06:54.480 --> 06:57.183
Oh, my God, your hair looks so good.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.986
I'm gonna have a mint night
for Jay's birthday

07:00.052 --> 07:02.889
but no,
in walks Barney the dinosaur.

07:02.955 --> 07:06.826
I've got this new hair, new attitude,
and I can't wait to see everyone.

07:08.628 --> 07:11.564
Just rocked up
in purple fucking hair.

07:11.631 --> 07:13.399
Man, she's mad.

07:13.466 --> 07:15.768
What?!

07:15.835 --> 07:18.171
Is this a mirage?
Have I been away too long?

07:18.237 --> 07:20.406
Have I not ate enough?
Am I seeing Jay?

07:21.274 --> 07:24.610
Oh, my God!
You all right?

07:24.677 --> 07:26.546
Aye.
Oh, my God, I'm shaking!

07:26.612 --> 07:28.047
Can you believe it?
No.

07:28.114 --> 07:29.882
So I want to speak to James,

07:29.949 --> 07:33.286
get everything cleared
and hopefully make everything OK.

07:33.352 --> 07:35.188
James, can I talk to you, please?

07:35.254 --> 07:36.522
Like yer hair.

07:36.589 --> 07:38.424
I don't know how this is gonna go.

07:38.491 --> 07:42.628
All I know is I can't be arsed
with any more arguments.

07:42.695 --> 07:45.064
Er, I'm sorry for hitting you.

07:45.131 --> 07:46.599
Right.

07:46.666 --> 07:51.404
Erm...
And, yeah, that's about it, really.

07:51.470 --> 07:54.440
Holly's attempt at an apology
is fucking pathetic.

07:54.507 --> 07:57.410
Don't make me feel any worse
than I already do.

07:57.476 --> 07:58.845
Sympathy vote again.

07:58.911 --> 08:01.614
It's not a sympathy vote,
you're a stupid prick.

08:01.681 --> 08:05.585
I'm watching James and Holly argue
and I can't help but think,

08:05.651 --> 08:08.054
thank fuck this isn't
me and Gary any more.

08:08.120 --> 08:10.723
Do you know what this is?
Fucking Karma. Karma?

08:10.790 --> 08:11.958
What have I done?

08:12.024 --> 08:14.927
Fuck it. Jay's back.
I'm ignoring James.

08:14.994 --> 08:16.462
It's the best thing for us.

08:16.529 --> 08:18.397
We can't be around each other.

08:19.332 --> 08:22.168
I'm sick of these arguments.
Holly, suck me cock.

08:22.235 --> 08:25.471
James, sort your hair out,
let's get fucking pissed.

08:35.948 --> 08:40.986
Who the fuck in their right mind
names a club Scary Canary?

08:45.324 --> 08:47.526
Charlotte is different, reserved.

08:47.593 --> 08:49.528
All to do with
having someone at home

08:49.595 --> 08:52.431
and not wanting to fuck things up
by getting with me.

08:54.367 --> 08:57.370
Charlotte doesn't want to be
friends, or speak to him,

08:57.436 --> 09:00.106
or want to look at him,
which I can understand.

09:01.707 --> 09:05.211
I'm not gonna let things get awkward
between me and Holly.

09:05.278 --> 09:07.914
I'm here to have a good night
with Jay, that's it.

09:10.216 --> 09:13.352
We're getting off it,
it's me birthday.

09:16.055 --> 09:18.724
As soon as she's dropped
them shots off I'm like,

09:18.791 --> 09:20.626
yeah, we need another 14 shots.

09:29.802 --> 09:31.137
Gary wants to chat,

09:31.203 --> 09:34.240
but to be honest, I don't know
what's left to talk about.

09:34.307 --> 09:37.810
It is weird not getting
Charlotte's attention 24/7,

09:37.877 --> 09:39.946
but it got to the point
where the drama

09:40.012 --> 09:42.648
was taking over the fun side
and the flirty side.

09:48.354 --> 09:50.022
I'm kinda taking baby steps.

09:50.089 --> 09:52.758
I don't want to dive in
and be bosom buddies

09:52.825 --> 09:54.293
and get a slap in the face.

10:00.232 --> 10:02.401
When I look at Gary now I feel empty.

10:02.468 --> 10:04.570
I've got nothing.

10:04.637 --> 10:07.707
I'm like a starfish.
I'm just a shape.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.187
Charlotte's got a new fella.

10:21.253 --> 10:24.557
I'm gonna take a step back,
be civil and let her get on with it.

10:34.867 --> 10:36.535
It is weird and it is awkward,

10:36.602 --> 10:39.805
but at least we're still speaking,
that's the main thing.

10:42.875 --> 10:45.144
Being in a relationship
can be amazing,

10:45.211 --> 10:48.447
but it's nothing like the feeling
you get when you're single.

10:48.514 --> 10:52.151
And tonight that just hit us like
a ton of bricks. I'm having fun.

10:55.654 --> 10:57.323
I spot the lad I tashed on with

10:57.390 --> 10:59.825
and there's a bonus,
he's got a mate for Holly.

11:01.293 --> 11:05.131
I don't massively fancy the lad
that Vicky's picked out for me.

11:05.197 --> 11:08.334
But I'm shit at pulling and I've
been offered him on a plate.

11:08.401 --> 11:10.870
I steel me self.
I discover me lady balls.

11:13.906 --> 11:15.374
There are plenty tashing.

11:17.710 --> 11:22.214
So Vicky and Holly have got lads
before me and Gaz have pulled at all.

11:22.281 --> 11:23.616
There's my girls.

11:25.184 --> 11:28.687
He has one major flaw.
The worst patter I've ever heard

11:28.754 --> 11:30.189
in me fucking entire life.

11:33.325 --> 11:36.562
So I just keep tashing on with him
to shut him the fuck up.

11:40.800 --> 11:43.335
Shit.
I think mine smells a bit like damp.

11:47.273 --> 11:50.176
It's good cos Jay's got a bird,
James has got a bird,

11:50.242 --> 11:52.244
they can talk about relationships

11:52.311 --> 11:54.580
and leave me and Scott
to go off and pull

11:54.647 --> 11:57.917
and there's not that much pressure
on us to include James.

11:57.983 --> 12:01.220
Me and Scott are so competitive
and we love girls that much

12:01.287 --> 12:04.924
and we love going out, it just feels
if your mate pulls and you don't

12:04.990 --> 12:07.593
it's just degrading.
You're just, like, fuck!

12:10.496 --> 12:13.966
It is funny watching Gary and Scott
going out pulling birds.

12:14.033 --> 12:17.203
If Gary had a bird, Scott's like,
"Shit, I need a bird!"

12:17.269 --> 12:19.605
And it's just
competition, competition.

12:22.007 --> 12:24.009
This is my cue
to get me self a bird.

12:25.144 --> 12:29.248
I pulled, I'm sitting back like a
smug little bastard watching Scott

12:29.315 --> 12:32.985
cos he will not leave this club
without a girl if I've pulled.

12:54.440 --> 12:57.877
Fuck me, I've been pulling some
pure naughty birds in Sydney.

12:57.943 --> 13:00.212
He banged his bird
in Charlotte's piss.

13:00.279 --> 13:01.680
Scott's fucking flipped.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.451
He's turned his attentions.

13:05.518 --> 13:07.520
Tonight is my turn in the shag pad.

13:08.721 --> 13:10.389
Whoo, wankers!

13:10.456 --> 13:12.691
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

13:14.994 --> 13:15.194
.

13:17.730 --> 13:17.930
.

13:32.811 --> 13:35.214
Charlotte's first night out
with everyone

13:35.281 --> 13:37.416
and she's already
been sick on tables,

13:37.483 --> 13:39.285
rolled round all over the floor.

13:39.351 --> 13:40.953
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

13:42.054 --> 13:46.025
I can't see, I can't hear,
I can't speak.

13:48.127 --> 13:52.498
Shots of tequila, vodka,
Scary Canary drinks and all that.

13:52.565 --> 13:54.466
I'm off me face me self, man.

13:54.533 --> 13:57.269
She had a mint night,
couldn't even fucking walk.

14:02.041 --> 14:04.243
Oi, oi!

14:05.744 --> 14:07.680
The whole family's back together,

14:07.746 --> 14:10.482
which mean there isn't enough beds
for everyone.

14:10.549 --> 14:12.585
So I go up to the shag pad
to go to sleep

14:12.651 --> 14:15.854
cos Scott and Gaz have pulled
and can bang in the same room.

14:15.921 --> 14:18.023
We get back and standard procedure,

14:18.090 --> 14:20.526
straight up to the shag pad.
Dustin Hoffman.

14:20.593 --> 14:23.829
Lions, right, lions.

14:23.896 --> 14:25.998
I feel like I'm stuck
in groundhog day.

14:26.065 --> 14:28.267
Every single night
is exactly the same.

14:28.334 --> 14:30.669
Dirty bastards.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.642
Scott, I'm in here.

14:37.843 --> 14:39.678
Holly's fucking lying in the bed.

14:39.745 --> 14:43.048
It's not you sucking my cock
tonight, it's this bird. Get out.

14:43.115 --> 14:46.919
I've got no fucking bed, Scott.
Just go in the bed near Gary.

14:46.986 --> 14:48.854
All the other beds are taken.

14:48.921 --> 14:52.524
Go and bang her next to Gary
cos youse normally do that anyway.

14:52.591 --> 14:55.628
Scott thought, "Yes, I got
the shag pad, I'm up there."

14:55.694 --> 14:58.197
I was like, "Mate, have it,
I'm going to bed."

14:59.732 --> 15:02.101
He got all the drama
trying to get Holly out,

15:02.167 --> 15:04.136
while I'm downstairs fucking.

15:04.903 --> 15:08.040
Where am I supposed to go?
In the bed with Sophie.

15:08.107 --> 15:09.575
Vicky's in there.

15:09.642 --> 15:13.178
Holly is refusing to get out.
She's fucking winding us up.

15:13.245 --> 15:14.480
What's she playing at?

15:14.546 --> 15:17.716
I can't fucking go
in any other fucking bed.

15:17.783 --> 15:21.253
The boys seem to think that
they can monopolise two bedrooms

15:21.320 --> 15:22.655
when there's only four.

15:22.721 --> 15:25.057
Idiot!
Holly, I didn't mean to piss you off

15:25.124 --> 15:27.259
but I've slept in that bed
every night.

15:27.326 --> 15:30.462
Yeah, and I haven't got
a fucking bed! I haven't got a bed!

15:30.529 --> 15:33.299
Oh, fuck off!
Where do you want me to go?

15:33.365 --> 15:35.267
Fuck off!
(thud)

15:35.334 --> 15:38.837
Holly's took it too far, so I take
it out on everything in me path.

15:42.274 --> 15:44.276
Whoa. Scott's fucking flipped.

15:44.343 --> 15:46.679
He's smashing the whole
fucking house up.

15:51.450 --> 15:54.386
She must be thinking,
"What an absolute tit."

15:54.453 --> 15:56.555
(banging)

16:02.127 --> 16:03.595
Hi.

16:04.997 --> 16:09.001
Back to business.
Cheeky nest on the sofa, oi, oi.

16:38.764 --> 16:42.167
I can't believe it.
I pissed me self again last night.

16:42.234 --> 16:44.370
Oh, my God.

16:44.436 --> 16:47.606
I wake up and the best news
you can ever find out

16:47.673 --> 16:50.576
is Scott got demoted
from the shag pad to the sofa

16:50.642 --> 16:54.513
and, to make things worse, he banged
his bird in Charlotte's piss.

16:58.917 --> 16:59.952
What the fuck?

17:02.287 --> 17:05.523
I christened the house.
No-one else was gonna do it.

17:05.590 --> 17:08.827
It's not something I'm proud of,
it's becoming a problem.

17:13.132 --> 17:15.334
So last night was fucking crazy.

17:15.401 --> 17:17.569
It all kicked off
between me and Scott

17:17.636 --> 17:19.771
because he expected me
to move for him.

17:30.315 --> 17:31.917
(girls coo)

17:43.896 --> 17:47.800
I decide to take the rest of the
house on one of my little day trips.

17:54.640 --> 17:57.943
It's amazing having me best mate
back in the house.

17:58.010 --> 18:00.112
I just really wish
he didn't have to go.

18:03.148 --> 18:05.884
Jay's excursions
are notoriously wank.

18:08.487 --> 18:10.689
Kay-fucking-crapping.

18:10.756 --> 18:12.224
It's a load of shit.

18:12.291 --> 18:14.293
It's just a fancy word for a canoe.

18:14.359 --> 18:16.328
Whoa! Whoa, steady.

18:17.963 --> 18:21.500
Me and James are sharing. It's a
perfect opportunity to catch up.

18:21.567 --> 18:24.303
I woke up with such a hangover.
Normally I'm fine.

18:24.369 --> 18:27.005
It was back to drinking
the Jay measures. I know.

18:27.072 --> 18:29.641
The minute Jay comes back,
we're all ruined.

18:29.708 --> 18:32.377
I didn't think I was gonna have
a good night. Why?

18:32.444 --> 18:34.546
When Holly...
Cos of Holly.

18:34.613 --> 18:36.215
I've tried to make an effort

18:36.281 --> 18:38.317
and it just gets hoyed back
in me face.

18:38.383 --> 18:40.919
I know it's stupid
but time is the best healer.

18:40.986 --> 18:42.688
She does need longer than you.

18:42.754 --> 18:46.325
I'm genuinely concerned how James
is gonna cope once Jay goes.

18:46.391 --> 18:49.228
He's got this new lease of life
now that Jay's here.

18:49.294 --> 18:52.531
What's gonna happen when he goes?
How are things with Gary?

18:52.598 --> 18:56.168
Do you know what, like, during
the day, everything's all right.

18:56.235 --> 19:00.105
On a night they wanna go
and fucking pull 24/7.

19:00.172 --> 19:03.375
When Jay leaves it's gonna go back
to him being segregated

19:03.442 --> 19:07.412
because he's got a girlfriend and
doesn't get on with Gaz and Scott.

19:07.479 --> 19:11.250
(Charlotte) Suckers. Suckers!
What she's saying to us and that...

19:11.316 --> 19:13.218
Charlotte! Shut up.
Suckers!

19:13.285 --> 19:16.088
Me and James are having
this deep conversation

19:16.154 --> 19:20.192
and Charlotte and Sophie are in
the background being general cocks.

19:21.493 --> 19:22.694
Oh, my God!

19:22.761 --> 19:24.429
Whoo, wankers!

19:44.349 --> 19:48.787
Second night out and we rock up
to this place called Golden Sheaf.

20:00.165 --> 20:02.167
I am missing Mitch a lot.

20:02.234 --> 20:05.270
I'm full of missing someone
and lonely.

20:06.872 --> 20:09.141
I know that she's happy
with this new boy

20:09.207 --> 20:12.010
but, at the same time,
she's lost part of her.

20:12.077 --> 20:16.181
She's lost that wild, funny side
who has loads of banter.

20:16.248 --> 20:20.786
For two years I've been going out,
getting mortal, shagging boys,

20:20.852 --> 20:24.189
crying over boys. Just because
I'm in a different place now

20:24.256 --> 20:26.191
don't think any differently of us.

20:37.336 --> 20:39.838
James is positively glowing
in his company

20:39.905 --> 20:43.308
and it's so nice to see cos he
hasn't had a lot to be happy about.

20:53.352 --> 20:56.655
Gary is a naturally
very overtly sexual person.

21:04.129 --> 21:06.465
Charlotte's not here
to give us ball ache.

21:06.531 --> 21:08.066
This is fucking perfect.

21:14.373 --> 21:16.708
Me and Gaz are in competition
for pulling.

21:16.775 --> 21:19.745
We're just single lads
out enjoying ourselves.

21:24.650 --> 21:28.120
Fuck me, I've been pulling
some pure naughty birds in Sydney.

21:46.204 --> 21:48.707
(Jay) I just find it funny.
The competition.

21:48.774 --> 21:50.175
Oh, yeah, I agree with ya.

21:55.714 --> 21:59.051
It's been so good having another lad
with some banter,

21:59.117 --> 22:01.453
who's not just arsed about
pulling birds.

22:01.520 --> 22:02.888
It's competition.

22:02.954 --> 22:05.490
If one of them's doing it,
the other one has to.

22:05.557 --> 22:07.492
I know exactly how James is feeling

22:07.559 --> 22:10.929
cos I was in his position
this time last year.

22:10.996 --> 22:14.800
And I just hope James stays in Oz
till the end.

22:14.866 --> 22:19.037
They're not so much quality,
they're more quantity, aren't they?

22:25.510 --> 22:29.414
Vicky, I'm struggling. I don't know
what these worm like things are.

22:34.553 --> 22:36.888
Scott and Gary rush
their lasses upstairs

22:36.955 --> 22:38.957
without a second glance
at any of us.

22:43.028 --> 22:44.996
Well, that was rude.
I know.

22:45.063 --> 22:47.799
Every single night we go out,
if one of them pulls,

22:47.866 --> 22:49.968
the other one ultimately has to.

22:50.035 --> 22:52.838
It's not a case of, aw, not tonight.
They have to.

23:01.146 --> 23:04.883
Scott is stuck in our room cos
tonight is my turn in the shag pad.

23:13.158 --> 23:16.294
I can tell that there's no way
her knickers are coming off.

23:27.906 --> 23:30.509
Some crazy bird naked in the garden.

23:30.575 --> 23:32.844
God forbid I have any tan lines.

23:32.911 --> 23:35.347
I hope when I leave
it doesn't fall apart.

23:35.413 --> 23:37.482
(thud)
(laughs)

23:37.549 --> 23:40.118
Family time means do not pull birds.

23:40.185 --> 23:42.721
What part of family night
don't you understand?

23:43.855 --> 23:46.124
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

23:48.393 --> 23:48.593
.

23:51.129 --> 23:51.296
.

24:05.844 --> 24:08.947
Last night was mint. Everyone
had the time of their lives.

24:13.151 --> 24:16.721
Class night getting mortal
and, you know what, it's been mint.

24:19.324 --> 24:20.625
I'm absolutely gutted

24:20.692 --> 24:23.829
cos I think the kid really
is a good addition to the house.

24:23.895 --> 24:28.166
We'll do beach, get a little
hair cut, get back, get out again

24:28.233 --> 24:30.402
and keep this fucking
100% record up.

24:40.946 --> 24:42.981
Hey, guys.

24:43.048 --> 24:45.383
In walks Crocodile Dundee again.

24:45.450 --> 24:48.653
What a fucking pig sty.
What the fuck's all this shit?

24:50.755 --> 24:54.492
I know exactly what he's came for,
Scott's little punching tantrum.

24:54.559 --> 24:56.962
Who's done the damage
to the fucking walls?

24:57.028 --> 25:00.465
Punching walls and thinking
he'll get away with it is stupid.

25:00.532 --> 25:02.734
Steve's here.
He's gonna get punished.

25:02.801 --> 25:04.736
Who's knocked the wall around?

25:07.639 --> 25:09.841
Any other damage
to this fucking place?

25:09.908 --> 25:13.278
Just the walls and...
Just the walls. Is there more walls?

25:13.345 --> 25:17.082
So Steve's giving us wrong and
I just cannot take him seriously.

25:17.148 --> 25:19.484
He looks and sounds
like a bread bin.

25:19.551 --> 25:22.020
You're gonna hang back
because of this shit.

25:22.087 --> 25:24.723
These holes in the wall.
Clean this house up.

25:24.789 --> 25:28.226
I could give you a better punishment.
Send you to the park

25:28.293 --> 25:31.596
to pick up dog shit with your
fucking mouth. I don't give a fuck.

25:31.663 --> 25:33.698
So me punishment is clean the house.

25:33.765 --> 25:36.268
Wicked, I've never
fucking done that before.

25:38.503 --> 25:40.272
Let's go and find these girls.

25:42.207 --> 25:44.409
Me, Sophie and Holly are hiding.

25:44.476 --> 25:45.977
Oi, guys!

25:46.044 --> 25:47.245
Fucking open it.

25:47.312 --> 25:49.614
You need a fucking D9 to unlock it.

25:50.849 --> 25:53.018
That's the steam room.

25:53.084 --> 25:55.854
Who the fuck has broken
the fucking lampshade?

25:57.122 --> 26:00.325
Ah, yeah. What the fuck are youse
doing hiding down there?

26:01.559 --> 26:04.162
Don't touch that,
there's wee on there. What?!

26:04.229 --> 26:07.866
Awkward. Steve's picked up a sofa
that's drenched in my piss.

26:07.933 --> 26:09.734
That was wet, too.

26:11.269 --> 26:13.371
Hope it doesn't drip on your head.

26:13.438 --> 26:16.574
(girls cheer)

26:19.711 --> 26:21.947
It suddenly turns into
girls gone wild.

26:22.013 --> 26:24.983
Fucking hell, youse can clean up.

26:25.050 --> 26:30.388
No. Get your arses upstairs,
get yourselves fucking sorted out.

26:30.455 --> 26:33.892
I'm going, I'm gone. I want this
house cleaned up. I mean it.

26:33.959 --> 26:35.760
(girls yell)

26:35.827 --> 26:37.362
Bloody nora!

26:40.966 --> 26:44.669
I'm feeling sorry for the girls
cos they're hurting me eyesight.

26:46.504 --> 26:49.374
I'm thinking I need a spray tan.

26:51.209 --> 26:53.411
It's the longest
I've not spoken to Mitch.

26:53.478 --> 26:56.848
Frustrating cos I'm waiting
to have fun with you and Holly.

26:56.915 --> 27:00.986
There's a definite difference
in Charlotte's whole demeanour

27:01.052 --> 27:04.823
since she came. The lights are on
but no-one's home at the moment.

27:04.889 --> 27:08.893
Just because you're not single
doesn't mean you can't have fun.

27:08.960 --> 27:11.997
Vicky is being selfish
saying that she's disappointed

27:12.063 --> 27:14.499
cos she can't have fun with us
and be single.

27:14.566 --> 27:17.702
I was single for two years
while she was in a relationship

27:17.769 --> 27:19.304
and I didn't complain once.

27:19.371 --> 27:22.707
When I'm out in the club I'm like,
this is fucking boring. Oh!

27:22.774 --> 27:25.977
I know that was so harsh
but it just had to come out.

27:26.044 --> 27:28.646
I haven't been drinking
cos I don't fancy it,

27:28.713 --> 27:31.583
and I don't wanna pull anyone,
so what's the point?

27:31.649 --> 27:34.185
You're growing up
in front of me very eyes.

27:34.252 --> 27:36.221
I can't believe it. I'm so mature.

27:36.287 --> 27:40.225
If mature means boring
I'm not bothered.

27:40.291 --> 27:42.093
We've changed roles.

27:42.160 --> 27:44.195
I know.
Fuck!

27:53.471 --> 27:55.940
It's me last night
in the Geordie Shore house

27:56.007 --> 27:58.209
so I'm gonna bring
the family together.

27:58.276 --> 28:00.078
We're gonna have a nice meal.

28:01.946 --> 28:05.150
He's the dad of the group.
He bonds us all together.

28:10.655 --> 28:14.259
When Jay goes, I'm back to being
stuck with the two pretenders,

28:14.325 --> 28:15.326
Gaz and Scott.

28:15.393 --> 28:17.495
Who's fucking hungry?

28:17.562 --> 28:19.164
(cheering)

28:19.230 --> 28:22.801
Scott and James bring up the food.
It looks fucking fantastic.

28:24.669 --> 28:28.306
It's been wicked having Jay here
and I'm gutted that he has to go.

28:28.373 --> 28:31.843
I bet James is as well cos he's
the only other lad who's wifed in.

28:31.910 --> 28:33.244
Liberty.

28:33.311 --> 28:36.214
Let's have a cheers to Jay.
His last night.

28:36.281 --> 28:37.949
(all toast Jay)

29:04.576 --> 29:08.179
It's Jay's last night, so I'm not
gonna pull. I'm proud of me self.

29:08.246 --> 29:10.949
Jay, this a big deal.
You are one lucky man.

29:13.985 --> 29:18.089
When everyone says it's family time
they mean it's family time.

29:18.156 --> 29:20.792
Family time means do not pull birds.

29:28.633 --> 29:32.337
I'm hitting the dance floor
and I'm back with the Jay dance.

29:32.403 --> 29:34.372
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

29:37.108 --> 29:40.378
I used to get hurt when Charlotte
used to get upset over Gary

29:40.445 --> 29:41.813
and now she's got Mitch,

29:41.880 --> 29:43.982
yeah, it has been a bit more boring.

29:44.048 --> 29:47.018
But fucking hell,
I would much rather be boring

29:47.085 --> 29:48.953
than shagging that parsnip.

29:57.495 --> 29:59.898
Everyone says
I bring the group together.

29:59.964 --> 30:02.467
I hope when I leave
that it doesn't fall apart.

30:10.875 --> 30:13.678
It's finally sunk in
that Jay's leaving.

30:13.745 --> 30:16.047
Me and Holly still haven't made up.

30:16.114 --> 30:19.551
I just hope things don't go back
to the way they were.

30:27.192 --> 30:30.061
Scott's seen a bird
and started necking on with her.

30:30.128 --> 30:31.563
Mate, you're on thin ice.

30:31.629 --> 30:34.332
What part of family night
don't you understand?

30:42.073 --> 30:44.309
We're not bringing birds back
tonight,

30:44.375 --> 30:47.045
but I can line me self up
for a date in the week.

30:55.920 --> 30:59.190
Next thing you know, Scott's
necking on with some blondie.

31:01.559 --> 31:04.495
Cheeky phone number, cheeky kiss,
see you later.

31:04.562 --> 31:08.066
I don't think Scotty T has realised,

31:08.132 --> 31:10.969
this has actually sunk in,
that it's family time.

31:11.035 --> 31:14.305
That doesn't register with him.
He's out pulling birds.

31:14.372 --> 31:18.042
Three second fucking memory,
worse than Scramble and Eggs.

31:18.109 --> 31:20.612
Not Toast,
cos Toast is very intelligent.

31:36.761 --> 31:40.665
This just shows how much respect
Scott's got for everyone. None.

31:44.402 --> 31:46.504
I've never seen Charlotte like this.

31:46.571 --> 31:49.607
I'm used to her being happy
and me and her having a laugh.

31:53.311 --> 31:55.980
Charlotte is fucking booting off
about Scotty T

31:56.047 --> 31:59.350
and I think she may have
some misplaced anger issues.

32:03.588 --> 32:05.623
When I think you've got anger issues

32:05.690 --> 32:08.192
you've got a serious
fucking problem.

32:23.675 --> 32:27.679
It's time to confront Scott.
He's pissed us off so much tonight.

32:27.745 --> 32:30.281
The girl went, "I'll come back."
I went, "No."

32:30.348 --> 32:32.083
I'm meeting her in the week.

32:32.150 --> 32:35.853
If the lasses said don't pull a bird
in the club, I wouldn't have.

32:35.920 --> 32:38.056
But they said
don't bring a bird home.

32:38.122 --> 32:40.358
I didn't spend any time
with you tonight.

32:40.425 --> 32:44.128
Not once did I see you cos
you were talking to girls all night.

32:44.195 --> 32:47.598
I thought Geordie Shore was about
going out, getting pissed,

32:47.665 --> 32:49.701
going on the pull and having a laugh.

32:49.767 --> 32:51.736
Yet I'm getting complained at.

32:51.803 --> 32:54.372
We just want everyone to be
together.

32:54.439 --> 32:57.909
So whilst we're confronting Scott,
he puts on this little face

32:57.975 --> 32:59.744
so everyone's like, "Scotty."

32:59.811 --> 33:01.813
How can you stay mad at this?

33:01.879 --> 33:03.414
You do that every night.

33:03.481 --> 33:04.882
He's never gonna listen,

33:04.949 --> 33:08.686
he's never gonna change and I'm
never gonna bond with him. Fuck it.

33:11.289 --> 33:13.157
Argh, you fucker.

33:13.224 --> 33:15.827
It was me!

33:15.893 --> 33:17.929
Do you know, you fuck!

33:17.995 --> 33:19.597
(bed cracks)

33:25.603 --> 33:30.174
I was looking for me fuckin' book
and I found that arachnid.

33:33.244 --> 33:34.245
(bed cracks)

33:37.215 --> 33:38.449
(laughs)

33:38.516 --> 33:41.319
It's amazing, Gary.
Me and you are drama free.

33:58.903 --> 34:02.707
You'll never guess what day it is.
Grilled cheese sandwich day!

34:02.774 --> 34:05.676
I can do anything I want
cos I'm fucking single.

34:05.743 --> 34:08.146
I really, really, really miss Mitch.

34:08.212 --> 34:10.348
I'm not gonna be able
to do this any more.

34:10.415 --> 34:13.184
They've all got faces
like fucking turtles.

34:13.251 --> 34:16.120
She's getting kicked out
for being too pissed.

34:16.187 --> 34:18.489
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

34:20.757 --> 34:20.958
.

34:23.494 --> 34:23.628
.

34:41.846 --> 34:44.282
I've had a class last night
in the house.

34:44.348 --> 34:47.717
Dancing, getting mortal,
it feels like I've never been away.

34:53.891 --> 34:56.360
The last thing I'd expect
to wake up to

34:56.427 --> 34:59.931
is some crazy bird
running round naked in the garden.

35:13.411 --> 35:17.381
Never guess what day it is.
Grilled cheese sandwich day!

35:17.448 --> 35:20.785
It's grilled cheese sandwich day.
What the fuck?

35:20.852 --> 35:22.687
I know, it's shocking.

35:22.753 --> 35:24.322
Has she made this up?

35:24.388 --> 35:25.756
Is it a real thing?

35:25.823 --> 35:28.159
Do I really fucking give a shit?

35:28.226 --> 35:30.361
Grilled cheese sandwich day.

35:31.696 --> 35:37.702
Any nation that devotes a single day
to a grilled cheese sandwich

35:37.768 --> 35:41.172
is the kind of nation
I want to be born in.

35:43.574 --> 35:45.176
Shut up, man.

35:45.243 --> 35:47.778
That's the most ridiculous thing
she's said.

35:47.845 --> 35:52.283
The only one who wants to celebrate
the fun of this day with us is Jay.

35:52.350 --> 35:55.186
Fucking best meal I've had.
Loved it.

35:55.253 --> 35:58.589
Jay's idea of fine dining
is a fucking cheese toasty.

35:58.656 --> 36:01.759
Can you imagine his hard on
if someone gave him a Pot Noodle?

36:01.826 --> 36:05.062
The only day I've heard like this
is steak and blow job day.

36:05.129 --> 36:07.064
Much better than grilled cheese.

36:07.131 --> 36:10.568
Right, I'm gonna go pack me stuff.
You off? Aye.

36:14.572 --> 36:16.574
Enjoy the rest of your time.

36:19.744 --> 36:21.412
I've had a few heart to hearts.

36:21.479 --> 36:24.882
I've said everything I needed to
say. It's time for me to leave.

36:24.949 --> 36:27.451
(Sophie) Bye, Jay.
See youse later.

36:27.518 --> 36:28.719
Have a safe journey.

36:28.786 --> 36:30.688
It's been so nice having Jay here.

36:30.755 --> 36:35.059
It reminded wur of old times,
bit of fresh air, company for James.

36:35.126 --> 36:37.328
Emotional wreck last time I left.

36:38.429 --> 36:40.531
(all) Bye!

36:40.598 --> 36:43.301
Now Jay's gone, it's back to me,

36:43.367 --> 36:46.237
the girls and two lads
who couldn't give a shit.

36:48.072 --> 36:51.709
I'm leaving today
and I hope it doesn't go to pot

36:51.776 --> 36:54.045
and everyone starts
falling out again.

37:05.122 --> 37:08.559
I'm gonna course a bird through
the night and go for a mission.

37:13.230 --> 37:15.099
What better way to enjoy Sydney?

37:15.166 --> 37:19.070
Wicked bird, mint sunset
and pingin' car.

37:27.945 --> 37:31.682
Yeah, I think this sunset's got us
both in the mood, pure frisk.

37:36.954 --> 37:38.322
What's wrong?

37:40.758 --> 37:43.728
I'm just sad.
What's the matter?

37:43.794 --> 37:46.130
I really, really, really miss Mitch

37:46.197 --> 37:49.867
and everyday it seems like it's just
getting harder and harder.

37:54.005 --> 37:57.408
She's obsessed with Mitch.
She wants to see him more and more,

37:57.475 --> 38:00.077
but she's chose to be in Australia
and it is hard

38:00.144 --> 38:03.014
and I do understand
the way she's feeling. It's shit.

38:06.717 --> 38:10.321
He needs to believe that Charlotte
is not gonna go back with Gary,

38:10.388 --> 38:13.324
but he can't see it,
so how is he ever gonna believe it?

38:13.391 --> 38:17.228
He can have his fucking shitty
doubts cos every day that goes by

38:17.294 --> 38:19.997
you're proving that
they're nothing but doubts.

38:20.064 --> 38:22.800
You look gorgeous, by the way.
Oh, thank you.

38:24.835 --> 38:28.539
When are you going on your date?
I'm going on it.

38:28.606 --> 38:31.609
I was getting ready there,
but I got a bit side tracked.

38:31.676 --> 38:34.845
I'm about to go on my first date
since I broke up with Ricci.

38:34.912 --> 38:39.183
I'm a little bit nervous, little bit
anxious, little bit apprehensive.

38:49.360 --> 38:51.696
My mission to get absolutely mortal

38:51.762 --> 38:55.599
and show people I'm not boring
and show them how drinking is done.

38:55.666 --> 38:57.368
Yeah, three!

39:05.009 --> 39:07.278
He's sneaked off in the Merc
to meet a girl.

39:07.344 --> 39:09.246
To me, that is being competitive.

39:22.893 --> 39:26.430
I think I might take the car
more often cos the scenery's wicked.

39:41.812 --> 39:44.181
This is my first date since Ricci.

39:44.248 --> 39:46.450
This is the third time
I've met Luke now,

39:46.517 --> 39:50.121
so I suppose this is
quite a significant event.

39:50.187 --> 39:53.090
It occurs to me that every time
I've met this lad

39:53.157 --> 39:54.558
I've been fucking mortal

39:54.625 --> 39:57.495
and I've genuinely not got
a clue what he looks like.

39:57.561 --> 39:59.697
Hey, how are you?
You look really nice.

39:59.764 --> 40:01.198
Thank you, so do you.

40:01.265 --> 40:04.368
I remembered him
all Edward Cullen of Twilight.

40:04.435 --> 40:07.471
In reality he's more Adam Sandler,
The Wedding Singer.

40:11.642 --> 40:13.778
The most annoying thing
about this lad

40:13.844 --> 40:16.547
has to be the fact that
his hair keeps waving at us.

40:20.284 --> 40:23.487
Crazy question my boss asked me
at my first job interview,

40:23.554 --> 40:26.824
if you could be any animal,
what would you be and why?

40:26.891 --> 40:29.627
It's as if it's on a fucking hinge.

40:29.693 --> 40:30.961
I quite like that.

40:31.028 --> 40:34.598
What the fuck have you used
to style your hair?!

40:34.665 --> 40:36.734
The date's not going that badly.

40:36.801 --> 40:38.702
That could be the Sambuca talking.

40:38.769 --> 40:41.772
Before I know it, we're going in
for the fucking tash.

40:43.707 --> 40:47.077
I don't even know why.
I don't even fucking fancy him.

40:48.345 --> 40:50.948
This is how far
I've managed to come in a week.

40:51.015 --> 40:54.385
Can you imagine how far by the end?
I'll be having threesomes.

40:54.451 --> 40:57.288
I could even be engaged again.
Who fucking knows?

41:02.092 --> 41:04.962
I want to get really drunk
so I want you to help us.

41:05.029 --> 41:08.432
That's OK. I'm an expert in that
field. I can feel like you are.

41:17.208 --> 41:18.475
Fuck me.

41:21.278 --> 41:24.148
They are absolutely mortal.

41:28.052 --> 41:32.089
Charlotte is not herself any more.
I feel like I've lost a best friend.

41:42.066 --> 41:44.535
I am missing Mitch a lot.

41:44.602 --> 41:47.004
This is the longest
I've never spoke to him.

41:49.707 --> 41:52.877
Since Charlotte arrived,
she's been a bit subdued.

41:52.943 --> 41:57.081
I know she's got a guy back home, but
she's gotta remember she's got us.

42:09.693 --> 42:12.029
I've never seen the girls argue
for ages.

42:12.096 --> 42:14.198
It's like walking into
world war nine.

42:14.265 --> 42:18.269
You've got Sophie and Vicky against
Charlotte and Holly. It's going off.

42:24.642 --> 42:27.578
Just because I've met someone
who I really care about

42:27.645 --> 42:30.047
doesn't mean that I'm boring.

42:34.752 --> 42:37.087
Don't lose sight of everyone else.

42:37.154 --> 42:40.157
Cos when you do, you start
to lose sight of yourself.

42:45.329 --> 42:48.599
This is the weirdest night
in the whole of Geordie Shore.

42:52.236 --> 42:56.040
What the fuck is going on?
I don't understand.

42:56.106 --> 42:59.176
I'm so drunk
and now we're all arguing.

43:01.645 --> 43:04.882
Something's kicked off.
They've all got faces like turtles.

43:04.949 --> 43:08.118
I'm using this to my advantage.
Head down, pull some girls.

43:14.358 --> 43:16.060
Geordie Shore are back.

43:16.126 --> 43:18.329
We are getting kicked out of clubs

43:18.395 --> 43:20.998
and, shock,
it's Charlotte and Holly.

43:24.134 --> 43:26.804
She's kicked out the club
for being too pissed.

43:28.706 --> 43:30.507
Leave the club in a taxi...

43:31.709 --> 43:33.844
Three girls. One bed. Night, night.

43:35.846 --> 43:38.949
So I find out Gaz
didn't even bang any of these birds.

43:39.016 --> 43:40.451
He had a slumber party.

43:40.517 --> 43:44.455
Can't have five minutes' craic with
the lads without getting birds in.

43:44.521 --> 43:48.058
It's time for them to know that
no-one wants them here any more.

43:48.125 --> 43:49.360
(all yell)

43:49.426 --> 43:53.097
This is more Charlotte
turning everyone else against us.

43:53.163 --> 43:58.068
My mission tonight is to pull.
You are better off without him.

43:58.135 --> 44:02.206
I don't want to think about him
and I don't want to be hurt.

44:02.272 --> 44:04.908
We made the most of the bush
in the outback.

44:04.975 --> 44:06.276
Gary's got a fanny!

44:32.536 --> 44:32.703
.
