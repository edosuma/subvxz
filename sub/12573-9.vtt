00:02.706 --> 00:04.790
Joyous news, Lord Rahl.

00:04.813 --> 00:06.627
The forces you sent to Kelabra

00:06.651 --> 00:09.651
have delivered
the second Box of Orden.

00:11.000 --> 00:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:30.769 --> 00:31.909
Send word to Queen Milena,

00:31.955 --> 00:34.141
tell her that I accept
all her demands,

00:35.002 --> 00:37.138
in return for the third box.

00:37.205 --> 00:38.676
Forgive me, Lord Rahl,

00:38.723 --> 00:40.792
but why would we pay
such a generous price

00:40.839 --> 00:42.188
when one division
of our forces

00:42.234 --> 00:44.806
could crush Queen Milena
to dust?

00:44.839 --> 00:47.405
Once I have all three boxes,

00:47.472 --> 00:48.793
the magic of Orden will give me

00:48.840 --> 00:51.305
unchallenged power
over everything,

00:51.956 --> 00:54.639
and Milena's demands

00:54.706 --> 00:56.375
will be meaningless.

01:01.655 --> 01:03.981
There lives Queen Milena.

01:04.027 --> 01:06.701
Not the most beloved monarch
in the Midlands.

01:08.050 --> 01:10.238
When she was still
Princess Milena

01:10.305 --> 01:12.120
she took command
of her father's armies

01:12.167 --> 01:14.639
and attacked
the Kingdom of Tramontana.

01:15.097 --> 01:16.872
Thousands were slaughtered,

01:17.470 --> 01:19.447
because she wanted
a pink sapphire

01:19.470 --> 01:21.939
the size of a large
pumpkin seed.

01:22.470 --> 01:24.739
And she got it.

01:24.806 --> 01:27.772
How many people did she kill
for the third Box of Orden?

01:28.168 --> 01:29.772
She inherited it.

01:29.839 --> 01:32.939
It's been in the treasure room
for a thousand years.

01:33.006 --> 01:34.706
We're almost too late!

01:34.750 --> 01:36.262
The talk in the village
is that Queen Milena

01:36.308 --> 01:39.680
has been whipping her servants,
quite literally, unfortunately,

01:39.727 --> 01:43.891
into a frenzy over the arrival
of an emissary from Darken Rahl.

01:43.914 --> 01:46.039
This emissary must be coming
for the third box.

01:46.105 --> 01:47.639
Yes.

01:47.681 --> 01:49.105
When does this emissary
get here?

01:49.147 --> 01:50.681
Tomorrow.

01:50.984 --> 01:53.372
Then we've got one day

01:53.402 --> 01:55.147
to sneak into a locked room

01:55.193 --> 01:58.105
somewhere inside
a heavily fortified castle,

01:58.241 --> 02:00.496
steal the most valuable object
in the world,

02:00.543 --> 02:02.606
and then sneak out again.

02:03.264 --> 02:06.272
Or Darken Rahl gets the box
and rules us all.

02:06.310 --> 02:08.589
If the roast looks
too big to eat,

02:08.613 --> 02:10.739
chop it in half.

02:11.311 --> 02:13.205
You two delay the emissary,

02:13.272 --> 02:15.218
and I'll get into the castle.

02:15.242 --> 02:16.404
How?

02:20.498 --> 02:22.205
"Hear ye, hear ye,

02:22.272 --> 02:24.754
"Ten gold pieces
to the entertainer

02:24.801 --> 02:27.801
"who proves himself worthy
of performing

02:27.824 --> 02:30.429
"at the birthday party
of Her Celestial Highness

02:30.475 --> 02:32.305
Princess Violet of Tamarang."

02:32.372 --> 02:34.973
Entertainer? What does that
have to do with you?

02:35.359 --> 02:38.806
Do you know anyone more
entertaining than me?

02:52.305 --> 02:55.152
Go on.
Swallow the hilt.

02:56.572 --> 02:58.105
Next.

03:04.316 --> 03:05.246
Next.

03:05.292 --> 03:07.339
Next. Next.

03:07.405 --> 03:10.409
Greetings, Your Highness.

03:15.572 --> 03:17.672
Hello, Princess Violet.

03:17.739 --> 03:19.439
I'm Mr. Stocking.

03:19.505 --> 03:21.706
Happy birthday.

03:23.372 --> 03:24.759
Guards!

03:24.805 --> 03:28.177
Throw this idiot off the grounds
before I chop off his head.

03:28.224 --> 03:32.073
Forgive me, Your Magnificence,
for disappointing you.

03:32.574 --> 03:35.248
Hey, where are you
going without me?

03:36.597 --> 03:38.062
What do you mean,
"where am I going?"

03:38.109 --> 03:41.457
I lost the job because of you,
you worthless, stinking rag.

03:41.504 --> 03:43.405
First you blame me
for losing the job,

03:43.472 --> 03:45.620
now you blame me
for being stinky.

03:45.643 --> 03:49.784
Something sure smells around
here but it isn't me.

03:52.156 --> 03:54.040
You're hired.

03:56.203 --> 04:00.205
Ruben Rybnik,
grand puppeteer,

04:00.272 --> 04:03.839
at Her Majesty's service.

04:04.274 --> 04:10.227
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com presents</font> 

04:10.599 --> 04:12.320
Legend of the Seeker

04:12.507 --> 04:15.368
<font color="#ffff00">Capture:·ëÎµ@FRM
Sync:Óêäì@FRS</font>

04:15.507 --> 04:17.647
For the party
I want a puppet of me.

04:17.692 --> 04:19.344
But better
than a stocking puppet.

04:19.391 --> 04:21.339
More lifelike.
Can you do that?

04:21.404 --> 04:24.647
The question, dear princess,
is not what can I do,

04:24.693 --> 04:27.043
but what can't I do.

04:28.741 --> 04:30.939
See this? Solid gold.

04:31.006 --> 04:33.539
I got it for
my fifth birthday.

04:33.927 --> 04:35.439
Eighth birthday.

04:35.505 --> 04:38.438
The rope is made out of the
finest silk in all the Midlands.

04:38.485 --> 04:40.672
It took some old lady
a year to make it.

04:40.719 --> 04:44.253
It's probably worth
more than someone like you
can even imagine.

04:45.184 --> 04:46.974
Oh, I got her last year

04:47.021 --> 04:49.463
so that I could practice
my leadership on her.

04:50.556 --> 04:52.472
He's the puppeteer for my party.

04:52.539 --> 04:56.039
If you don't make me too angry
you will get to watch the show.

04:56.301 --> 04:57.606
Hello.

05:01.185 --> 05:04.464
Excellent demonstration
of leadership, princess.

05:04.510 --> 05:06.092
I'm teaching her etiquette.

05:06.138 --> 05:08.973
But as Your Celestial
Highness knows,

05:09.039 --> 05:11.884
the threat of a blow
is often more effective

05:11.930 --> 05:13.272
than the blow itself.

05:13.339 --> 05:15.172
Maybe where you come from.

05:15.209 --> 05:17.672
Now, show the puppeteer
what I taught you

05:17.739 --> 05:19.744
before I hit you again.

05:20.674 --> 05:22.954
How do you do, kind sir?

05:27.039 --> 05:29.238
Very well, thank you.

05:29.512 --> 05:32.652
And it is indeed a pleasure
to make your acquaintance.

05:33.372 --> 05:35.303
May I ask your name?

05:36.105 --> 05:37.772
Rachel.

05:39.188 --> 05:40.739
Here's my dress.

05:40.806 --> 05:42.572
Oh, Your Highness,

05:42.639 --> 05:46.095
you are the very soul
of understated elegance.

05:46.141 --> 05:50.339
Now, what would truly set off
Your Majesty's beauty would be--

05:50.405 --> 05:53.839
No, no, of course, your mother
would never let you wear that.

05:53.906 --> 05:55.305
Would never let me wear what?

05:55.352 --> 05:58.138
The famous Pink Sapphire
of Tramontana.

05:58.205 --> 06:00.672
I'm sure when you're a little
older, you'll be allowed to.

06:00.739 --> 06:03.097
I'm allowed to wear any jewel
in the castle right now.

06:03.144 --> 06:05.539
But surely the Pink Sapphire
of Tramontana

06:05.606 --> 06:06.702
is locked in a vault.

06:06.748 --> 06:08.772
My mother lets me go anywhere
in the castle,

06:08.839 --> 06:10.772
even the Treasure Room.

06:10.795 --> 06:13.585
I think I could go
get it right now.

06:13.609 --> 06:15.330
Is that really the key

06:15.376 --> 06:17.261
to the Treasure Room
of Tamarang?

06:17.307 --> 06:20.372
I've dreamt all my life
of seeing those wonders.

06:20.439 --> 06:21.400
Keep on dreaming.

06:21.447 --> 06:23.284
I'm the only one allowed
in the Treasure Room.

06:23.331 --> 06:24.739
Wait right here.

06:35.169 --> 06:37.105
If I were Rahl,

06:37.146 --> 06:38.820
I'd send more
than three soldiers

06:38.867 --> 06:41.505
for the third Box of Orden.

06:41.572 --> 06:43.076
If you were Rahl,

06:43.122 --> 06:45.147
you'd send a small party
of troops ahead

06:45.193 --> 06:46.984
to make sure
the roads were safe.

06:49.772 --> 06:54.031
You know,
if we grabbed one of the scouts,

06:54.310 --> 06:56.147
and you confessed him,

06:57.751 --> 07:02.439
you could ask him nicely to send
a message back, couldn't you?

07:02.505 --> 07:06.008
Telling Darken Rahl
that Queen Milena won't be ready

07:06.055 --> 07:08.846
to deliver the box
for at least a week.

07:55.106 --> 07:57.806
What did you do that for?
I had him.

07:57.872 --> 08:00.129
It looked to me like he had you.

08:03.305 --> 08:05.272
This is what
I was afraid of.

08:05.339 --> 08:08.039
That I'd save your le?

08:08.083 --> 08:10.479
That you'd let
your feelings for me

08:10.525 --> 08:12.572
get in the way of the mission.

08:12.639 --> 08:14.772
He was about to kill you,
and I stopped him.

08:14.839 --> 08:16.906
We had a rare opportunity,

08:16.973 --> 08:20.539
and we missed it because
you were being overprotective.

08:27.372 --> 08:29.619
What's that?

08:30.205 --> 08:31.898
It's a Journey Book.

08:31.945 --> 08:35.304
It's how Darken Rahl
communicates
with his commanders
from far away.

08:36.527 --> 08:39.714
He writes in his book, and
the words appear in this one.

08:39.760 --> 08:41.294
Richard,
th might tell us exactly

08:41.341 --> 08:44.131
when the emissary is coming,
and by what route.

08:48.156 --> 08:50.006
Rachel.

08:50.073 --> 08:52.970
How did you come by
such a beautiful name?

08:53.017 --> 08:55.947
I was named
after my grandmother.

08:57.672 --> 08:59.839
Where is your grandmother now,
dear one?

08:59.906 --> 09:02.390
The queen's soldiers
killed her.

09:03.181 --> 09:05.739
She didn't fall to her knees
fast enough

09:05.806 --> 09:08.948
when the queen came
riding by in her carriage.

09:09.390 --> 09:13.948
They killed my mother and
my father and my brother too.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.974
You took the sting away.

09:36.485 --> 09:40.505
Rachel, I need your help
with something very important.

09:40.572 --> 09:43.205
Have you ever been
in the Treasure Room?

09:43.486 --> 09:44.505
Yes.

09:44.572 --> 09:47.238
And have you seen
the Box of Orden?

09:47.742 --> 09:48.739
Yes.

09:48.806 --> 09:50.835
Princess Violet hates it,

09:50.882 --> 09:52.882
because it's the only thing
in the castle

09:52.928 --> 09:55.272
she's not allowed to touch.

09:55.324 --> 09:57.772
And does Violet ever take
the key off her neck?

09:58.139 --> 10:01.022
No.
She even sleeps with it.

10:01.069 --> 10:03.272
Do you sleep in the room
with her?

10:03.339 --> 10:05.743
She makes me
sleep in that box.

10:05.766 --> 10:08.806
But sometimes when
she think's I'm being bad,

10:08.872 --> 10:11.372
she makes me sleep outside.

10:11.439 --> 10:14.093
Sometimes I'm bad on purpose

10:14.116 --> 10:16.939
because I like sleeping
outside better.

10:16.977 --> 10:19.442
I like hearing the crickets.

10:19.488 --> 10:22.305
Rachel, I have something special
I'd like to give you.

10:24.862 --> 10:27.699
It's called
a Trouble Doll.

10:27.722 --> 10:31.772
You tell her your troubles,
and she takes them away for you.

10:33.466 --> 10:34.536
I can't.

10:34.583 --> 10:37.816
Princess Violet says I'm not
allowed to have my own toys.

10:38.235 --> 10:41.816
If I keep it she'll throw it
in the fire.

10:42.677 --> 10:46.172
Rachel,
in all my travels

10:46.238 --> 10:48.816
I have never met
a ghastlier little monster

10:48.863 --> 10:50.572
than Princess Violet
of Tamarang.

10:50.956 --> 10:51.747
Shh!

10:51.794 --> 10:55.747
If the princess knows you said
that she'll have you killed.

10:55.771 --> 10:58.399
I trust you not to tell.

10:58.422 --> 11:01.305
You remind me very much
of my own daughter.

11:01.372 --> 11:05.205
She was brave and strong,
just like you.

11:05.272 --> 11:08.609
Dear one, why don't you take
the doll and hide it?

11:08.656 --> 11:11.238
Princess Violet doesn't need
to know. It'll be our little--

11:13.672 --> 11:15.472
I didn't say you could
talk to him.

11:15.539 --> 11:17.372
You're sleeping outside tonight.

11:17.439 --> 11:19.447
But first, go to the kitchen
and tell the cooks

11:19.494 --> 11:22.039
that my roast at lunch
was dry and stringy.

11:22.261 --> 11:24.272
Tell them that
if that happens again,

11:24.339 --> 11:26.610
they'll have to pay for it
with their hides.

11:26.633 --> 11:27.839
Go!

11:32.105 --> 11:34.751
Your Magnificence,
if you would excuse me,

11:34.774 --> 11:37.844
I need to make my preparations
for the festivities.

11:43.146 --> 11:47.073
Not one lump in that icing,
or we'll both have hell to pay.

11:47.124 --> 11:48.973
Put some more
salt in that.

11:49.635 --> 11:50.739
Hello, sweetheart!

11:50.806 --> 11:51.798
Hello, Martha.

11:51.845 --> 11:53.682
Just in time to lick the spoon.

11:53.728 --> 11:56.305
Only lick fast,
before you-know-who gets here.

11:56.372 --> 11:58.845
You-know-who says
I'm supposed to tell you

11:58.891 --> 12:02.311
that if the roast is
stringy again, she'll flog you.

12:02.776 --> 12:05.171
You tell that spoiled brat
that all the crops in Tamarang

12:05.218 --> 12:07.427
go to feed the queen
and her rich friends.

12:07.450 --> 12:08.706
There's not a crust
of bread left

12:08.753 --> 12:10.218
for me to feed
my children with,

12:10.264 --> 12:13.311
and if anyone
deserves flogging, it's her.

12:22.033 --> 12:25.033
This servant has proven herself
unfit for the job

12:25.079 --> 12:26.986
and disloyal
to the crown.

12:27.755 --> 12:29.839
Take her to the block.

12:32.104 --> 12:33.685
And who are you?

12:33.708 --> 12:35.220
Your Majesty,

12:35.267 --> 12:37.732
it is the highest honor
of my life

12:37.778 --> 12:40.439
to present to you
your humble servant,

12:40.505 --> 12:43.439
Ruben Rybnik, grand puppeteer,

12:43.505 --> 12:45.472
graciously chosen
by your daughter

12:45.539 --> 12:48.372
for the amusement
of her guests.

12:48.779 --> 12:52.073
I applaud your alacrity
in stamping out insolence,

12:52.138 --> 12:55.839
but if Your Majesty disposes
of such a talented cook

12:55.906 --> 12:57.338
before the banquet,

12:57.385 --> 13:01.505
I do hope the princess doesn't
miss her favorite dessert.

13:07.339 --> 13:09.205
Release her.

13:09.272 --> 13:11.372
She shall be granted
a stay of execution

13:11.439 --> 13:13.939
until the party's over.

13:14.006 --> 13:15.739
And as for you,

13:15.806 --> 13:17.805
your access to the castle
shall be strictly limited

13:17.851 --> 13:20.772
to the servant's quarters
and the banquet room.

13:20.839 --> 13:23.238
As Your Majesty wishes.

13:53.320 --> 13:56.006
<i>I didn't mean to get
Martha in trouble.</i>

13:56.250 --> 13:59.040
Why do I always
make things worse?

14:00.040 --> 14:02.436
I wish I could run away
from here.

14:02.482 --> 14:04.039
With you.

14:04.088 --> 14:07.832
We'd go so far away
that nobody would ever find us.

14:10.839 --> 14:12.639
Don't be sad, Rachel.

14:14.507 --> 14:17.345
Ruben is going to take you
away with him.

14:18.298 --> 14:21.539
But first he needs to get hold
of the Box of Orden

14:21.973 --> 14:26.252
so that Queen Milena can never
hurt anyone ever again.

14:27.508 --> 14:30.405
And for that,
he needs your help.

14:30.974 --> 14:35.439
And he needs you
to be very, very brave.

15:33.995 --> 15:36.563
Well done, Rachel.

15:36.979 --> 15:39.421
Sara told me you needed help.

15:39.468 --> 15:41.096
You gave her a name.

15:41.162 --> 15:43.537
I'm sure that made her
very happy.

15:43.584 --> 15:46.165
Now wait here with Sara, and
when I come back with the box,

15:46.212 --> 15:47.677
we'll leave together,

15:47.723 --> 15:50.463
and you'll never see
this castle again.

15:50.886 --> 15:52.351
Where will we go?

15:52.398 --> 15:55.352
I don't know just yet,

15:55.538 --> 15:58.469
but I promise
I'll find you a safe place,

15:58.492 --> 16:00.376
with people
who will be overjoyed

16:00.422 --> 16:03.236
to have a girl as wonderful
as you to care for.

16:04.829 --> 16:06.595
Darken Rahl is coming.

16:07.307 --> 16:09.888
What?
Look. Right here.

16:09.935 --> 16:11.958
According
to yesterday's orders,

16:12.005 --> 16:14.762
Rahl is coming
for the box himself.

16:15.842 --> 16:18.029
Kahlan.

16:18.096 --> 16:19.423
For the first time, ever,

16:19.470 --> 16:22.331
we know exactly where Rahl
is going to be.

16:25.773 --> 16:28.145
I can kill him.

16:28.192 --> 16:31.496
But he'll be surrounded
by soldiers, bodyguards...

16:32.029 --> 16:34.937
I can drop a running deer
at 200 paces with one of these.

16:34.984 --> 16:39.309
And Kahlan, we get to choose
exactly the spot we shoot from.

16:39.356 --> 16:41.588
All we need to do
is send a message back,

16:41.635 --> 16:45.463
directing Lord Rahl to
the perfect spot for an attack.

16:49.938 --> 16:51.096
What are you doing?

16:51.162 --> 16:53.129
The magic of the Journey Book
only works

16:53.196 --> 16:55.171
when the words
are written in blood.

16:55.194 --> 16:56.333
Well, then we'll use mine.

16:56.380 --> 16:59.845
Oh. I thought you weren't
being overprotective.

16:59.868 --> 17:01.333
I was--

17:07.762 --> 17:10.694
We've received word
from our scouts.

17:10.762 --> 17:12.939
The bridge on the main road
to Tamarang

17:12.986 --> 17:15.358
has been
washed out by a storm.

17:15.404 --> 17:18.684
We're being advised to take
the road through the Iron Hills.

17:20.242 --> 17:23.590
Through the narrow canyons and
dark woods of the Iron Hills?

17:23.637 --> 17:25.336
Yes, My Lord.

17:25.498 --> 17:27.032
It will delay you
by a day,

17:27.079 --> 17:29.848
but it could take weeks
to rebuild the bridge.

17:40.965 --> 17:42.329
My key!

18:23.595 --> 18:27.132
What are you doing in here?

18:30.457 --> 18:31.573
F-Forgive me, Princess.

18:31.620 --> 18:34.480
My-- My curiosity overcame me.

18:34.527 --> 18:36.713
How stupid
do you think I am?

18:36.760 --> 18:39.714
You have two seconds
to tell me what's going on

18:39.761 --> 18:43.295
before I scream my head off
and wake up the whole castle.

18:46.482 --> 18:47.947
You may want to turn
and look in the mirror

18:47.993 --> 18:50.496
before you make good
on that threat.

18:54.157 --> 18:57.762
My face! My beautiful face!
What have you done to me?

18:57.808 --> 19:01.483
Change me back right now
or I'll chop your head off!

19:01.506 --> 19:04.795
How will you get rid of the
warts if you chop my head off?

19:06.693 --> 19:09.262
It's called
a Tattletale Curse,

19:09.321 --> 19:11.262
Your Celestial Highness.

19:11.329 --> 19:12.553
I can take it away.

19:12.600 --> 19:14.832
But if you ever even
think of telling on me,

19:14.879 --> 19:18.129
the warts will reappear.
Forever.

19:18.484 --> 19:21.029
Whether I'm there or not.

19:27.415 --> 19:30.415
I got the box,
and I fixed Violet for good.

19:30.461 --> 19:32.811
By sunrise
we'll be six leagues away.

19:34.346 --> 19:35.904
What about Martha?

19:35.951 --> 19:37.323
Who?
Martha.

19:37.370 --> 19:39.207
The one whose head the queen
is gonna chop off

19:39.253 --> 19:40.962
after the party.

19:41.029 --> 19:43.062
We can't leave without her.

19:43.788 --> 19:47.496
We don't have time to go
to the servant's quarters.

19:47.563 --> 19:49.487
If Rahl gets his hands
on this box,

19:49.533 --> 19:51.510
he'll chop off
more heads than there are

19:51.557 --> 19:53.662
in the entire
Kingdom of Tamarang.

19:53.728 --> 19:56.626
I'm so sorry, but there are
too many lives at stake.

19:58.417 --> 20:00.929
But Martha has three children.

20:00.995 --> 20:04.829
If the queen kills her,
they'll starve.

20:16.396 --> 20:19.256
Post 16 extra men
on the south battlements,

20:19.303 --> 20:22.233
and 30 on the north.
Leave nothing to chance.

20:24.396 --> 20:27.256
What, may I ask,
is my daughter's puppeteer doing

20:27.303 --> 20:29.563
lurking about the castle
at this hour?

20:29.628 --> 20:32.537
I, uh, awoke
with a growling stomach

20:32.583 --> 20:34.816
and went to the kitchen
for a late night snack,

20:34.862 --> 20:38.560
and was just on my way back
to the servant's quarters.

20:43.561 --> 20:45.468
Guards,

20:45.514 --> 20:48.895
see to it that the puppeteer
finds his way back.

20:49.375 --> 20:52.695
And remain stationed
outside his room,

20:52.762 --> 20:56.096
in case he decides he needs
anything else.

21:14.493 --> 21:15.772
Where's Violet?

21:15.819 --> 21:18.610
In the banquet room inspecting
the party decorations.

21:18.656 --> 21:20.121
We don't have much time.

21:20.168 --> 21:22.308
The queen's guards
are following me everywhere,

21:22.355 --> 21:24.076
they're right outside
the door.

21:24.122 --> 21:25.564
If they're following
you everywhere,

21:25.611 --> 21:28.396
how are you gonna get
the box out of the castle?

21:28.611 --> 21:30.229
Rachel,

21:32.169 --> 21:34.634
it's up to you now.

21:34.657 --> 21:35.332
Me?

21:35.378 --> 21:38.030
I'd give all the riches
of all kingdoms in the world

21:38.077 --> 21:40.891
not to have to place
such a terrible burden on you.

21:41.054 --> 21:42.286
If there was any other way,
I--

21:42.333 --> 21:43.914
Don't be sad, Ruben.

21:43.961 --> 21:45.329
I can do it.

21:47.519 --> 21:49.728
I want to do it.

21:53.463 --> 21:55.915
Listen very carefully.

21:55.962 --> 21:59.101
Go to the kitchen and ask
Martha for a loaf of bread.

21:59.148 --> 22:01.403
Cut the loaf in half
and hollow it out.

22:01.450 --> 22:03.823
Hide the box inside.

22:03.870 --> 22:07.149
Tell the guards at the gate
that the princess has sent you

22:07.195 --> 22:08.474
to sleep outside.

22:08.521 --> 22:10.242
Go straight
through the woods,

22:10.288 --> 22:12.986
turn right at the stream
and follow it to the hill

22:13.032 --> 22:15.079
that overlooks the castle.

22:15.125 --> 22:17.229
You'll find friends there.

22:17.296 --> 22:20.289
Their names
are Richard and Kahlan.

22:21.661 --> 22:25.289
What about you and--
And Martha?

22:25.336 --> 22:26.917
The queen isn't
going to let me leave

22:26.964 --> 22:28.871
until I finish
the puppet show.

22:28.917 --> 22:32.962
And when I'm done, I promise
I'll do what I can for Martha.

22:38.593 --> 22:43.329
Rachel, you are now the most
important person in the world.

22:44.430 --> 22:47.245
Don't worry.
It'll be easy to get out.

22:47.291 --> 22:50.429
Everyone treats me
like I'm invisible anyway.

22:55.454 --> 22:57.291
You have to go now.

22:57.338 --> 22:58.830
Good luck, dear one.

23:08.665 --> 23:10.897
Martha, may I please
have a loaf of bread?

23:10.944 --> 23:12.480
Oh, I'm sorry little one.

23:12.526 --> 23:14.805
All of the bread is already
in the banquet room.

23:14.852 --> 23:17.463
I wanna lick the bowl!
Where is it?

23:18.735 --> 23:20.154
What are you doing in here?

23:20.177 --> 23:22.396
Nothing.

23:22.968 --> 23:25.095
Do you have something
behind your back?

23:27.202 --> 23:29.196
Show me your hands then.

23:39.133 --> 23:40.272
It's a present.

23:40.319 --> 23:42.482
I wanted it
to be a surprise.

23:42.528 --> 23:44.877
Happy birthday,
Princess Violet.

23:46.040 --> 23:48.133
You call this a present?

23:48.179 --> 23:50.229
Where'd you get it?
The trash?

23:50.738 --> 23:52.179
No!

24:01.716 --> 24:03.972
Why isn't my cake
in the oven yet?

24:04.996 --> 24:07.949
I...just need to add
the cardamom.

24:07.996 --> 24:09.879
I hate cardamom.
It makes me sneeze.

24:09.972 --> 24:11.930
Just put it in already.

24:13.879 --> 24:15.344
Are you deaf?

24:36.835 --> 24:38.905
Richard,
what if this is it?

24:38.951 --> 24:40.729
What do you mean?

24:42.695 --> 24:45.556
I mean,
what if you kill Rahl?

24:47.393 --> 24:50.045
It would all be over.

24:50.729 --> 24:54.092
The magic hold he has
over his forces would be gone.

24:54.789 --> 24:58.371
Some people might fight for a
while, but most would wake up,

24:58.417 --> 25:03.362
go back to their lives,
to their families.

25:06.511 --> 25:08.262
So could you.

25:10.139 --> 25:12.496
I have no family left.

25:15.443 --> 25:18.350
You could find somebody
to start one with.

25:48.538 --> 25:51.096
That's not him.

25:51.329 --> 25:53.050
His hands aren't holding
the reins,

25:53.096 --> 25:55.029
they're tied to them.

25:55.352 --> 25:57.237
Then he must know the message
in the Journey Book

25:57.283 --> 25:59.463
didn't come from
one of his own people.

25:59.748 --> 26:01.237
So he sent a double.

26:01.283 --> 26:03.896
But if that's not him,
then where is he?

26:08.329 --> 26:11.062
So sorry to interrupt
the party.

26:13.773 --> 26:18.121
Lord Rahl, what a welcome
and unexpected honor.

26:19.587 --> 26:22.062
The honor is all mine.

26:24.518 --> 26:27.429
How lovely you look today,
Queen Milena.

26:27.750 --> 26:29.496
And Princess Violet,

26:29.541 --> 26:30.960
so beautiful.

26:31.006 --> 26:33.062
The image of her mother.

26:36.635 --> 26:38.635
If I cut between
the two roses,

26:38.682 --> 26:40.100
we can get the box out

26:40.147 --> 26:42.863
and I can fix the damage
so nobody will notice.

26:43.961 --> 26:45.629
Now, quickly.

26:48.658 --> 26:51.287
What are you doing?

26:51.334 --> 26:55.830
The queen wants the cake
in the banquet hall now.

27:06.172 --> 27:09.591
Lord Rahl, before we adjourn
to the Treasure Room,

27:10.312 --> 27:12.219
won't you consider
doing us the honor

27:12.265 --> 27:13.729
of cutting the cake?

27:20.243 --> 27:22.629
It would be
my great pleasure.

27:30.011 --> 27:31.830
Wait!

27:36.012 --> 27:37.546
Who is this man?

27:37.570 --> 27:39.128
My apologies, Lord Rahl.

27:39.174 --> 27:40.756
He's nothing but
a common entertainer

27:40.802 --> 27:42.314
who doesn't know his place.

27:42.360 --> 27:46.827
I'm so sorry, Your Supreme
and Magnanimous Lordship.

27:46.873 --> 27:49.989
I only meant to say that the
princess specifically requested

27:50.036 --> 27:53.175
that we have the puppet show
before the cake.

27:53.222 --> 27:55.152
What are you--?

27:55.199 --> 27:56.385
Oh.

27:56.431 --> 27:58.796
Yes, I want
the puppet show first.

27:59.850 --> 28:03.037
May I present myself?

28:03.084 --> 28:08.339
Ruben Rybnik, grand puppeteer.

28:09.618 --> 28:11.200
Oh, Lord Rahl.

28:11.246 --> 28:12.897
If you would grant
this indulgence,

28:12.944 --> 28:14.759
it would mean so much
to my daughter.

28:14.806 --> 28:17.806
We can discuss our business
after the party.

28:18.061 --> 28:21.396
Unless of course the box
is of no importance to you.

28:24.782 --> 28:26.962
Of course, Queen Milena.

28:29.062 --> 28:31.162
Anything for
the birthday girl.

28:32.202 --> 28:34.830
Thank you, Your Lordship.

28:38.574 --> 28:41.482
So then my pony pranced with joy

28:41.505 --> 28:45.156
because it knew it belonged
to the prettiest princess
in all the land.

28:46.854 --> 28:48.178
When I was 3,

28:48.245 --> 28:50.715
and too small to ride
a real pony...

28:51.156 --> 28:53.296
As charming as this is,

28:53.319 --> 28:55.995
we do have more important
matters to attend to.

28:56.018 --> 28:57.845
Of course, My Lord.

28:58.902 --> 29:01.111
Finish quickly, puppeteer.

29:01.134 --> 29:02.972
Lord Rahl has more important
things to do

29:02.995 --> 29:04.995
than watch
your marionettes.

29:05.018 --> 29:07.158
Yes, Your Majesty.

29:12.205 --> 29:15.484
Beware, Darken Rahl,
I am the Seeker.

29:16.321 --> 29:18.182
The time
has finally come

29:18.205 --> 29:22.647
for me to kill you
and fulfill the Prophecy.

29:22.670 --> 29:25.509
What is the meaning of this?
Stop this at once.

29:25.532 --> 29:27.299
No.

29:28.090 --> 29:30.881
No, please,
continue with the show.

29:32.532 --> 29:36.183
I'd like to see how
this little fairy-tale ends.

29:39.603 --> 29:41.951
Come and fight me,
you coward!

29:42.998 --> 29:45.370
I came here to enjoy myself

29:45.393 --> 29:47.672
and celebrate
the princess' birthday.

29:47.696 --> 29:49.649
And here you are,
as always,

29:49.672 --> 29:53.022
trying to spoil the fun
for everybody.

29:53.999 --> 29:58.092
You know, you really are
the worst Seeker ever.

29:58.115 --> 29:59.743
I'm going to have to
kill you now

29:59.766 --> 30:02.545
and end your silly quest.

30:12.721 --> 30:15.861
Now, shall we cut the cake?

30:24.304 --> 30:27.078
Lord Rahl, wait!

30:28.024 --> 30:30.373
The show isn't over.

30:30.397 --> 30:33.235
Why, it's just begun.

30:34.165 --> 30:35.816
Still here, Rahl?

30:35.839 --> 30:38.026
Is that the best
you can do, Seeker?

30:38.049 --> 30:41.165
Fighting with you is so dull
I'm afraid I might fall asleep.

30:42.026 --> 30:45.585
I beg you, stay awake. A hero
as great and noble as myself

30:45.608 --> 30:48.143
would never kill a man
in his sleep.

30:48.166 --> 30:50.096
Your vanity is even greater

30:50.120 --> 30:51.678
than the size of your sword.

30:51.701 --> 30:54.045
Enough talk.
's time for you to die.

30:54.112 --> 30:56.712
Oh, somebody's going to die,
that's for certain.

30:56.778 --> 31:00.028
But I rather suspect
it isn't going to be me!

31:04.097 --> 31:06.563
Well done, puppeteer.

31:07.144 --> 31:09.214
Forgive me, princess,

31:09.237 --> 31:12.401
but the dull
business of state is calling.

31:12.796 --> 31:15.168
As it is to your mother.

31:15.192 --> 31:17.308
Highness?
Certainly, My Lord.

31:27.355 --> 31:28.518
Hurry, Rachel.

31:28.565 --> 31:30.960
They're on their way
to the Treasure Room.

31:53.753 --> 31:55.474
Are you trying to trick me?

31:57.544 --> 31:59.078
I'm sorry?

31:59.102 --> 32:01.497
This box is a counterfeit.

32:01.520 --> 32:02.916
That's not possible.

32:02.939 --> 32:04.241
Isn't it?

32:12.940 --> 32:17.800
Someone has used magic to turn
an ordinary spice box

32:17.824 --> 32:20.219
into a look-alike
Box of Orden.

32:21.522 --> 32:26.243
But there is nobody
with magic powers in my castle.

32:27.546 --> 32:31.011
Your stupidity is stunning!

32:31.057 --> 32:33.964
Seal the castle.
No one gets in or out.

32:33.988 --> 32:38.942
And bring me the puppeteer.

32:49.385 --> 32:51.571
Queen Milena tells me

32:51.618 --> 32:54.550
that you arrived in Tamarang
two days ago.

32:54.850 --> 32:56.711
Yes, Lord Rahl.

32:56.757 --> 32:59.749
I heard the princess
was looking for entertainers

32:59.816 --> 33:02.828
and this opportunity to perform
for you and for Her Majesty

33:02.874 --> 33:05.874
has been the pinnacle
of my career.

33:05.921 --> 33:07.944
Perhaps Your Lordship
has called me here

33:07.991 --> 33:09.944
to see more of my artistry?

33:09.991 --> 33:13.850
Oh, no, that's quite all right.

33:15.014 --> 33:17.480
I already know
what a master you are

33:17.527 --> 33:19.620
at the art of pulling
people's strings.

33:19.666 --> 33:21.916
Bind his hands.

33:24.783 --> 33:26.410
What's this?

33:26.457 --> 33:29.410
A cautionary measure
meant to insure my safety

33:29.457 --> 33:33.807
against an untimely blast
of wizard's fire.

33:33.853 --> 33:35.388
Wizard's fire?

33:35.435 --> 33:38.217
Puppets dancing
all by themselves.

33:38.505 --> 33:41.760
It certainly looked like
Wizard's work to me.

33:41.807 --> 33:44.783
Oh, Lord Rahl,
you flatter me too much.

33:44.850 --> 33:47.017
I'll show you how
the illusion works

33:47.040 --> 33:50.016
if you promise
not to tell a soul.

33:51.110 --> 33:53.901
Why don't you show me

33:53.947 --> 33:57.117
how this illusion
works instead?

33:58.297 --> 34:00.111
Only a Wizard
of the First Order

34:00.158 --> 34:03.135
could conjure a false
Box of Orden.

34:03.181 --> 34:06.321
This looks like
an ordinary spice box to me.

34:06.367 --> 34:08.484
Don't play games with me.

34:09.042 --> 34:10.926
Only three Wizards
of the First Order

34:10.973 --> 34:13.205
have been born
in a hundred years.

34:13.252 --> 34:14.484
One died.

34:14.531 --> 34:16.786
One works for me.
And the third,

34:16.833 --> 34:19.550
oh, what was his name?

34:20.391 --> 34:22.250
Oh, yes.

34:22.623 --> 34:24.516
Now I remember.

34:25.741 --> 34:31.927
His name was
Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander.

34:32.974 --> 34:34.717
He disappeared
right around the time

34:34.764 --> 34:37.020
I cleansed the town
of Brennidon

34:37.067 --> 34:38.487
in an attempt to save
the Midlands

34:38.533 --> 34:40.533
from the false promises
of the Seeker.

34:40.580 --> 34:44.114
But now the Seeker is back.

34:44.161 --> 34:46.949
And here you are.

34:47.766 --> 34:50.217
And here I am.

34:51.184 --> 34:54.139
But where is the box?

35:05.371 --> 35:06.884
Halt.

35:06.931 --> 35:08.861
No one goes in or out.

35:08.907 --> 35:11.628
But I go in and out
all the time.

35:11.675 --> 35:12.861
Sorry, little one.

35:12.907 --> 35:15.616
The orders came
from Lord Rahl himself.

35:19.117 --> 35:21.281
Can I have your name?

35:21.327 --> 35:24.653
So I can tell the princess
I tried to follow her orders

35:24.699 --> 35:26.397
but you wouldn't let me.

35:26.443 --> 35:29.374
She likes to chop people's heads
off who don't obey her.

35:29.420 --> 35:31.769
Especially on her birthday.

35:36.654 --> 35:38.840
<i>Tell me where the box is.</i>

35:38.886 --> 35:40.189
Now.

35:40.235 --> 35:42.537
I've hidden it.

35:42.584 --> 35:44.217
Magically.

35:44.283 --> 35:46.584
Kill me and you'll
never find it.

35:46.630 --> 35:49.864
I have no intention
of killing you, Zeddicus.

35:50.027 --> 35:52.376
I'm sure you'll keep your secret
till your dying breath,

35:52.422 --> 35:55.317
but I do enjoy a challenge.

35:55.383 --> 35:57.563
Lord Rahl,
I've received a report

35:57.609 --> 35:59.074
that one of Milena's guards

35:59.121 --> 36:01.214
has allowed someone to pass
through the south gate.

36:01.883 --> 36:02.749
Who?

36:02.795 --> 36:05.350
A little girl.
The princess' playmate.

36:11.749 --> 36:13.350
Find the girl.

36:34.960 --> 36:37.030
I think I went the wrong way.

36:37.077 --> 36:39.472
Sara, which way
should I go?

36:39.518 --> 36:41.350
Please help me.

36:42.659 --> 36:44.845
There she is!

37:34.198 --> 37:35.942
Over there!

37:35.989 --> 37:38.710
We have to run.
Come on.

37:48.348 --> 37:50.248
Are you Richard and Kahlan?

37:51.664 --> 37:52.897
Yes, we are.

37:52.943 --> 37:55.047
Ruben told me to find you.

38:00.618 --> 38:02.781
Is this Ruben a tall man
with long white hair?

38:02.827 --> 38:05.114
Thinks he's really funny?

38:24.214 --> 38:25.806
He did it.

38:30.969 --> 38:32.156
Where's Zedd?

38:32.202 --> 38:34.147
I mean, uh, Ruben?

38:34.621 --> 38:37.580
I think the bad man got him.

38:42.914 --> 38:46.622
The great Darken Rahl,
master of D'Hara,

38:46.669 --> 38:50.901
was defeated not by the Seeker
nor by the First Wizard,

38:50.948 --> 38:54.529
but by a 10-year-old girl.

39:25.649 --> 39:27.253
It's a puppet.

39:29.346 --> 39:33.081
I told you I was
the grand puppeteer.

39:44.766 --> 39:46.440
Rachel.

39:47.789 --> 39:49.881
Sara, you can talk!

39:49.929 --> 39:51.743
Where's Ruben?

39:51.789 --> 39:54.907
Right here, hoping there's
a bite of cake left.

39:54.953 --> 39:56.981
Ruben! Martha!

40:01.069 --> 40:03.651
Martha, I was so worried
about you.

40:03.674 --> 40:05.647
I know you were, sweetheart.

40:05.674 --> 40:08.139
Ruben told me you wouldn't
leave the castle without me.

40:09.814 --> 40:12.140
I've told my boys
so much about you

40:12.187 --> 40:14.512
and they've always wanted
a little sister.

40:14.536 --> 40:17.024
Would you like to come
and live with us?

40:17.605 --> 40:20.413
But Martha, what about
your own children?

40:20.480 --> 40:22.676
How will you feed all of us?

40:22.699 --> 40:25.513
Now, that reminds me,

40:25.537 --> 40:27.699
where was it?

40:30.048 --> 40:32.547
It's the Pink Sapphire
of Tramontana.

40:32.614 --> 40:36.724
Think of it as a parting gift
from Princess Violet.

40:37.380 --> 40:40.119
I'm sure she would want you
to have it.

40:51.957 --> 40:56.947
Lord Rahl, how can I ever
begin to apologize?

40:57.014 --> 41:01.314
Be assured I will not rest
until the rats in my dungeon

41:01.380 --> 41:04.380
are devouring the remains
of that thieving, lying Wiz--

41:04.447 --> 41:05.981
Wizard.

41:06.424 --> 41:09.238
Queen Milena,
it's quite all right.

41:11.679 --> 41:14.819
You couldn't have known that
we were all being deceived.

41:24.029 --> 41:26.239
Thank you
for your hospitality.

41:35.077 --> 41:37.947
Have no fear for your daughter,
Your Highness.

41:38.014 --> 41:41.635
She will grow up surrounded
by the most precious jewels.

41:41.728 --> 41:44.101
As a slave
in the deepest caverns

41:44.124 --> 41:46.845
of the Mines of Athanasia.

41:52.962 --> 41:55.613
Bring me
my Journey Book.

41:57.181 --> 41:59.547
Fascinating reading.

41:59.916 --> 42:03.800
Lord Rahl leaves no detail
unattended to in his orders.

42:05.521 --> 42:07.800
You were so close to him.

42:08.963 --> 42:10.637
No matter how close I get,

42:10.684 --> 42:13.127
only the Seeker can deal
the final blow.

42:15.801 --> 42:18.080
No going home yet.

42:23.778 --> 42:26.918
Lord Rahl is sending
a message.

42:30.383 --> 42:32.314
What's he saying?

42:37.732 --> 42:39.826
Four words.

42:41.664 --> 42:44.012
"I will find you."

42:45.036 --> 42:50.943
