00:09.634 --> 00:12.012
Campfire's ready. We are all set.

00:12.095 --> 00:13.096
Mater?

00:13.179 --> 00:16.975
That's how it is.
A progression of learners and teachers.

00:17.559 --> 00:20.103
Hey there, buddy. I met some new friends.

00:20.186 --> 00:22.731
I gotta say,
they some really interestin' folk.

00:23.148 --> 00:25.358
Hey, y'all come on over.

00:25.442 --> 00:27.569
But, Mater, I thought this was our time.

00:27.652 --> 00:31.156
We were going to hang out together,
make our own plans, right?

00:31.239 --> 00:34.576
Well, it seems to me
you're fighting that road trip sponte...

00:34.659 --> 00:37.537
Spotanei... Spontaneousish...Ugh!

00:37.620 --> 00:39.664
That "make it up as you go" spirit.

00:39.748 --> 00:42.667
I mean, what's wrong
with meeting some fun new friends?

00:43.376 --> 00:45.253
(OWL HOOTING)

00:46.546 --> 00:49.758
So, what brings you around to these parts?

00:49.841 --> 00:52.677
What brings you around these parts?

00:53.303 --> 00:56.139
Uh, I'm taking a trip with my friend.

00:56.222 --> 00:59.100
A perfectly innocent trip, with a friend?

00:59.976 --> 01:02.103
What's going on here?

01:02.187 --> 01:04.230
Are you both willing to question

01:04.314 --> 01:08.026
everything you think you know
about the natural world?

01:08.109 --> 01:10.070
Yeah, I'm not following here.

01:10.153 --> 01:12.363
We are researchers, Mr. McQueen.

01:12.447 --> 01:16.326
We straddle the thin veil
between the known and the unknown.

01:16.910 --> 01:19.704
-We hunt cryptids.
-Cryptids?

01:19.788 --> 01:21.998
Creatures on the fringes
of our perception.

01:22.082 --> 01:25.502
Which include your Chupacabras,
your mothmans,

01:25.585 --> 01:28.546
and, most especially, your Bigfoot.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.548
And we demand your oath of loyalty

01:30.632 --> 01:33.551
before we accept you
into our secret order.

01:33.718 --> 01:34.886
Secret order?

01:35.261 --> 01:36.721
What are you talking about?

01:39.849 --> 01:42.644
RANGE ROVER: These woods are a hotbed
for cryptid activity,

01:42.727 --> 01:44.979
specifically Bigfoot.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.442
Would you look at that?

01:50.652 --> 01:52.862
Really? Because I'm just not seeing it.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.155
But what do I know?

01:54.239 --> 01:57.325
Listen, you folks have
a fantastic Bigfoot hunt.

01:57.617 --> 01:58.827
I'll be in dreamland.

01:58.910 --> 02:02.330

Oh, you're not a monster.

You're a monster truck.

anything for anybody.

04:52.083 --> 04:53.084
Huh.

04:53.376 --> 04:56.129
Hey, so how about you cut me down?

04:56.421 --> 04:57.588
Not so fast.

04:58.339 --> 05:00.049
You seem harmless.

05:00.300 --> 05:03.011
So why are you hanging
with those gearsticks out there?

nothing to do with any of them. (GASPS)
