00:09.313 --> 00:11.359
<i>In the criminal justice system,</i>

00:11.359 --> 00:12.664
<i>the people are represented</i>

00:12.664 --> 00:15.232
<i>by two separate,
yet equally important groups:</i>

00:15.232 --> 00:17.017
<i>the police,
who investigate crime,</i>

00:17.017 --> 00:20.020
<i>and the district attorneys,
who prosecute the offenders.</i>

00:20.020 --> 00:21.760
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:22.935 --> 00:25.329
I'll be all right.
I'm just--

00:25.329 --> 00:28.419
I'm just going
through a phase right now.

00:29.768 --> 00:32.728
Everybody goes through phases
and all, don't they?

00:32.728 --> 00:34.556
I don't know, boy.

00:34.556 --> 00:35.774
I don't know.

00:41.084 --> 00:42.303
Put that away.

00:42.303 --> 00:43.478
I told you.

00:43.478 --> 00:44.696
When you're with me,
no cell phones.

00:44.696 --> 00:46.133
It's my mom.

00:47.656 --> 00:49.832
I gotta go.
- But we're not done.

00:49.832 --> 00:52.095
She'll ground me for life
if she finds out about this.

00:52.095 --> 00:54.054
You are acting like a child.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.751
I'm sorry.

00:55.751 --> 00:57.579
I'll see you next time.

01:06.979 --> 01:09.025
He's just a kid.

01:09.025 --> 01:11.506
Eli Barone,
14 years old.

01:11.506 --> 01:12.637
Gunshot wound.

01:12.637 --> 01:15.031
Took one to the chest,
close range,

01:15.031 --> 01:16.511
sometime between
10:00 p.m. and midnight.

01:16.511 --> 01:19.209
- Family in the building?
- Mm-hmm.

01:19.209 --> 01:20.428
Anybody find
that shell casing?

01:20.428 --> 01:22.908
Nope, and no gunshot residue.

01:22.908 --> 01:24.519
Or blood splatter.

01:24.519 --> 01:26.129
- Body was probably moved.
- Yeah.

01:26.129 --> 01:27.348
Looks like
he messed up his ankle

01:27.348 --> 01:28.827
somewhere along the way.

01:28.827 --> 01:30.786
Did the techs
find a blood trail?

01:30.786 --> 01:33.441
Nothing so far.

01:33.441 --> 01:36.096
Did he have anything on him?
Money, drugs?

01:36.096 --> 01:38.446
Just his keys and his phone.

01:42.711 --> 01:43.799
It was a school night.

01:43.799 --> 01:46.193
The kid should've
been home sleeping.

01:48.195 --> 01:50.414
What were you
doing out here, kid?

02:39.637 --> 02:42.988
Found him this morning,
just lying there.

02:42.988 --> 02:44.294
I couldn't believe it.

02:44.294 --> 02:45.513
He was a really good boy.

02:45.513 --> 02:47.210
Never gave anyone
a lick of trouble.

02:47.210 --> 02:48.733
- Oh, you knew him?
- Yeah.

02:48.733 --> 02:51.997
Moved in about seven months ago
after his father passed.

02:51.997 --> 02:53.651
His mom's a nurse.

02:53.651 --> 02:55.305
He's a good kid.
Good family.

02:55.305 --> 02:57.307
Who had access
to the stairwell?

02:57.307 --> 02:58.569
Oh, everybody.

02:58.569 --> 03:00.223
We have 200 units
in the building,

03:00.223 --> 03:02.573
so about 360 people,

03:02.573 --> 03:05.097
plus their guests, nannies,

03:05.097 --> 03:06.490
cleaners, delivery people.

03:06.490 --> 03:08.840
Did you hear anything unusual
last night?

03:08.840 --> 03:11.887
No, but I didn't leave
my apartment after around 6:00.

03:11.887 --> 03:13.932
- Where do you live?
- The basement.

03:13.932 --> 03:15.543
We don't get much activity
down there.

03:15.543 --> 03:17.327
How about cameras?
You got those?

03:17.327 --> 03:19.155
Lobby cam.
I'll get you the footage.

03:19.155 --> 03:20.504
Yeah.

03:20.504 --> 03:22.202
Her apartment's
right down here.

03:23.638 --> 03:26.728
Uh, you know what?
We need to take it from here.

03:33.561 --> 03:34.649
Yes?

03:34.649 --> 03:36.694
Ms. Barone,
we're the police.

03:36.694 --> 03:38.087
Would you mind opening up, please?

03:43.310 --> 03:45.747
What is it?

03:45.747 --> 03:48.663
I checked on him
when I got home from my shift.

03:48.663 --> 03:50.534
About what time was that?

03:50.534 --> 03:52.580
Um, around midnight.

03:52.580 --> 03:53.711
Ma'am, do you have any idea

03:53.711 --> 03:55.191
why your son
would stage the bed

03:55.191 --> 03:56.453
to look like he was still here?

03:56.453 --> 03:58.412
He must've snuck out,

03:58.412 --> 04:00.979
but--but why?

04:00.979 --> 04:02.677
Any idea where he was going?

04:05.245 --> 04:08.073
Can you tell me what he was
doing earlier in the day?

04:08.073 --> 04:09.945
He was in school.

04:09.945 --> 04:12.904
He had an algebra test.

04:12.904 --> 04:16.256
Uh, we're gonna need
to take Eli's computer.

04:16.256 --> 04:17.561
Yeah, whatever you need.

04:17.561 --> 04:19.650
Did he do anything
after school?

04:19.650 --> 04:21.783
He texted me he was going
to a friend's house.

04:21.783 --> 04:24.394
Do you have an address
for that?

04:24.394 --> 04:26.222
How about a name?

04:26.222 --> 04:28.790
Um...

04:28.790 --> 04:30.313
I don't know.

04:30.313 --> 04:32.272
You must think
I'm a terrible mother.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.664
Not at all. Teenagers.

04:33.664 --> 04:36.188
They operate
on a need-to-know basis.

04:36.188 --> 04:38.103
Wait, um,

04:38.103 --> 04:40.976
his name was Sean-something.

04:40.976 --> 04:43.935
Sean Kapinski?

04:43.935 --> 04:46.286
Yes, I think so.
How'd you know?

04:53.554 --> 04:55.556
What the hell are these?

04:58.428 --> 05:00.474
According to his website,
Sean Kapinski is

05:00.474 --> 05:03.607
a photographer/acting coach/
talent manager.

05:03.607 --> 05:05.087
The guy moved around a lot.

05:05.087 --> 05:08.220
Six different addresses
in the last four years.

05:08.220 --> 05:10.135
So what's his rap sheet
look like?

05:10.135 --> 05:11.615
- Clean.
- A'ight, got you.

05:11.615 --> 05:12.834
Thanks.
Hey, check this out.

05:12.834 --> 05:15.010
So Sean Kapinski
doesn't have a record.

05:15.010 --> 05:16.707
So we pulled the prints off
of the photos.

05:16.707 --> 05:18.622
They came back
to a Sean Capples.

05:18.622 --> 05:21.364
So Kapinski is living
under an alias?

05:21.364 --> 05:22.452
You got that right.

05:22.452 --> 05:23.671
Got a conviction in Chicago

05:23.671 --> 05:25.629
for possession of child porn.

05:25.629 --> 05:27.501
Finished off his probation.

05:27.501 --> 05:29.329
Changed his name to Kapinski.
Moved to Manhattan.

05:29.329 --> 05:32.114
Let's get a good address
on this creep and bring him in.

05:32.114 --> 05:33.115
Done.

05:35.378 --> 05:38.033
Sean Kapinski.

05:38.033 --> 05:39.643
I told you to stay close!

05:39.643 --> 05:42.254
Help! Please help!

05:42.254 --> 05:44.953
NYPD! Open up, Kapinski!

05:44.953 --> 05:46.346
- What the hell?
- Hey, back up.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.391
- Whoa!
- Back up!

05:48.391 --> 05:49.610
Young man,
we're the police.

05:49.610 --> 05:51.438
Are you all right?

05:51.438 --> 05:52.700
Is there anyone else here
with you?

05:54.484 --> 05:56.181
Did this man hurt you?

05:56.181 --> 05:57.879
Oh.

05:59.533 --> 06:00.882
Do your parents know
you're here?

06:00.882 --> 06:02.187
No? All right.

06:02.187 --> 06:03.363
We're gonna call your parents.
Come with me.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.452
Come on.
You're gonna be all right.

06:08.890 --> 06:11.327
What were you doing
with that kid?

06:11.327 --> 06:13.416
Rehearsing.

06:13.416 --> 06:16.158
It's a scene
from "The Truman Show."

06:16.158 --> 06:17.986
It's about a man who--
- Yeah, I've seen it.

06:17.986 --> 06:19.422
His whole life's
a reality show.

06:19.422 --> 06:21.990
I get it.
- Why are you here?

06:21.990 --> 06:23.470
Don't worry about that.

06:23.470 --> 06:25.689
We'll have a long conversation
down at the precinct.

06:25.689 --> 06:27.430
2-7, Squad to Central.

06:27.430 --> 06:28.692
This is Detective Shaw.

06:28.692 --> 06:30.825
I'ma need a sector transport
for a suspect

06:30.825 --> 06:32.870
down to the 2-7.

06:32.870 --> 06:33.871
Turn around.

06:33.871 --> 06:34.959
Put your hands
behind your back.

06:42.314 --> 06:44.447
Here you go.

06:44.447 --> 06:47.407
So, Brian, can you tell me
how old you are?

06:47.407 --> 06:48.582
15.

06:48.582 --> 06:50.366
Please don't tell my dad
about this.

06:50.366 --> 06:51.933
Honey, I'm afraid
it's a little too late.

06:51.933 --> 06:53.108
Your father's on his way.

06:53.108 --> 06:55.240
But we weren't
doing anything wrong.

06:55.240 --> 06:58.113
Can you tell me why you were
at Kapinski's apartment?

06:58.113 --> 06:59.462
He's my acting coach,
teaching me

06:59.462 --> 07:01.159
how to get comfortable
in front of the camera.

07:01.159 --> 07:04.032
Oh, so you wanna be an actor?

07:04.032 --> 07:06.426
Not really.
I just wanna be famous.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.557
Oh.

07:07.557 --> 07:10.299
You have a lot
of eager teenage boys

07:10.299 --> 07:13.041
hanging out at your apartment, unaccompanied.

07:13.041 --> 07:15.522
- How dare you--
- Oh, spare us the outrage.

07:15.522 --> 07:17.480
We know who you are.
We know about your past.

07:17.480 --> 07:19.351
So cut the crap
and tell us what's going on.

07:19.351 --> 07:21.136
You bust into my place.

07:21.136 --> 07:24.313
Then you haul
Brian and me in here.

07:24.313 --> 07:25.749
And now you're accusing me?

07:27.664 --> 07:30.319
I am
a legitimate talent manager.

07:30.319 --> 07:32.887
Our relationship
is purely professional.

07:32.887 --> 07:34.149
I mean, you can ask him.

07:34.149 --> 07:36.281
We did,
and you're right.

07:36.281 --> 07:39.110
But Brian's
not your only student.

07:39.110 --> 07:40.721
Excuse me?

07:40.721 --> 07:42.070
Tell us about Eli Barone.

07:42.070 --> 07:44.028
You were with him
last night, right?

07:44.028 --> 07:46.509
Yes, we had a session,
but I--

07:46.509 --> 07:48.946
I'm confused.
Why are we talking about Eli?

07:48.946 --> 07:50.513
Because he's dead.

07:50.513 --> 07:53.864
Somebody shot him in the chest.

07:53.864 --> 07:55.387
Eli is dead?

07:55.387 --> 07:58.565
And you were
the last person he was with.

07:58.565 --> 08:00.610
And you're
a convicted pedophile.

08:00.610 --> 08:02.003
You see
where we're going with this?

08:02.003 --> 08:03.657
I am not a pedophile.

08:03.657 --> 08:06.877
A 14-year-old boy is dead,
a mother is without her child,

08:06.877 --> 08:08.444
and you wanna play games?

08:08.444 --> 08:11.229
Okay, Mr. Kapinski,
let's play some games,

08:11.229 --> 08:12.579
or Mr. Capples,

08:12.579 --> 08:14.842
or whatever the hell name
you're usin' these days.

08:14.842 --> 08:17.061
Hold on!

08:21.631 --> 08:25.069
That conviction
is 15 years old.

08:25.069 --> 08:27.202
I was in high school.

08:27.202 --> 08:29.944
I texted a picture
of my girlfriend,

08:29.944 --> 08:31.511
with her shirt off,
to a friend.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.730
I got sentenced
to five years' probation.

08:33.730 --> 08:37.125
You know what? You're
not answering our question.

08:37.125 --> 08:39.214
What happened with Eli
last night?

08:39.214 --> 08:41.564
I was working with him.

08:41.564 --> 08:43.131
I was teaching him how to act.

08:43.131 --> 08:45.742
He was
a really gifted young man.

08:45.742 --> 08:48.528
I didn't kill Eli.

08:48.528 --> 08:49.920
That's absurd.

08:49.920 --> 08:52.706
We had a session,
and then he left,

08:52.706 --> 08:54.185
very much alive.

08:54.185 --> 08:55.752
Can you prove that?

08:57.580 --> 09:00.452
As a matter of fact, I can.

09:01.105 --> 09:04.065
<i>Everybody goes through
phases and all, don't they?</i>

09:04.065 --> 09:06.937
<i>I don't know, boy.</i>

09:06.937 --> 09:09.461
<i>I don't know.</i>

09:09.461 --> 09:10.724
I told you.

09:10.724 --> 09:12.247
<i>When you're with me,
no cell phones.</i>

09:12.247 --> 09:13.901
<i>It's my mom.</i>

09:15.685 --> 09:16.860
<i>I gotta go.</i>

09:16.860 --> 09:18.514
<i>But we're not done.</i>

09:18.514 --> 09:20.516
<i>She'll ground me for life
if she finds out about this.</i>

09:20.516 --> 09:22.344
<i>You are acting like a child.</i>

09:22.344 --> 09:23.388
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

09:23.388 --> 09:25.608
<i>See you next time.</i>

09:25.608 --> 09:27.915
Corroborates
what Kapinski said.

09:27.915 --> 09:30.874
Eli left that place alone.

09:30.874 --> 09:32.528
But what's Eli talking about,

09:32.528 --> 09:34.617
"Everybody goes
through phases"?

09:34.617 --> 09:37.272
He's doing Holden Caulfield
from "Catcher in the Rye."

09:37.272 --> 09:38.578
Oh, fancy.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.275
I didn't read much as a kid.

09:40.275 --> 09:41.624
Did the whole
Cliff Notes thing,

09:41.624 --> 09:43.713
except for "Lord of the Flies."

09:43.713 --> 09:45.628
Read the whole thing.
Loved it.

09:45.628 --> 09:47.761
- Mm.
- I'm not surprised.

09:47.761 --> 09:50.111
- Were you a big reader?
- Yeah, I was.

09:50.111 --> 09:52.853
Let me guess.
"Nancy Drew"?

09:52.853 --> 09:53.984
Jane Austen.

09:53.984 --> 09:56.160
The woman was way ahead
of her time.

09:56.160 --> 09:58.380
Hey, I got something.

10:01.165 --> 10:02.558
I've gone through
the surveillance video

10:02.558 --> 10:04.473
from Eli's apartment lobby.

10:04.473 --> 10:05.953
Does Kapinski
make an appearance?

10:05.953 --> 10:08.216
Not that I can see,
but Eli enters the building

10:08.216 --> 10:09.913
at 10:07 p.m.

10:09.913 --> 10:11.828
- Alone?
- Not exactly.

10:11.828 --> 10:14.483
He holds the door open
for this guy.

10:14.483 --> 10:16.311
Let a complete stranger
into the building.

10:16.311 --> 10:18.922
What's that he's carrying?

10:18.922 --> 10:20.315
Looks like a bag of food.

10:20.315 --> 10:22.665
He's probably
making a delivery.

10:22.665 --> 10:24.406
The guy goes
inside the building,

10:24.406 --> 10:27.670
and 29 minutes later,
he leaves.

10:27.670 --> 10:30.107
That's a long time to be just
dropping off a bag of food.

10:30.107 --> 10:32.327
Not if you're dropping off
food and killing a kid

10:32.327 --> 10:34.677
and then stealing his bike.

10:34.677 --> 10:36.331
All right,
let's trace that bag,

10:36.331 --> 10:37.506
find out where he works,

10:37.506 --> 10:39.377
and get a search warrant
for that bike.

10:45.035 --> 10:46.384
This looks like the place.

10:46.384 --> 10:48.648
And this
looks like Eli's bike.

10:54.828 --> 10:56.438
Hey, how you doin'?
We're detectives.

10:56.438 --> 10:58.092
We're looking for, uh...

10:58.092 --> 11:01.225
Somebody who might work here.

11:01.225 --> 11:03.663
Oh, he is right over there.

11:07.536 --> 11:09.886
Don't run. Don't run.

11:16.284 --> 11:18.068
I got inside.
Move! Move! Move!

11:18.068 --> 11:19.330
Police! Move!

11:39.524 --> 11:41.352
Are you serious?

11:44.225 --> 11:45.792
He's headed towards the river.

11:49.317 --> 11:52.102
Hands! Hands up!

11:52.102 --> 11:53.364
Put 'em behind your head!

11:53.364 --> 11:55.497
Get down on your knees! Down!

11:58.630 --> 12:00.676
Hey.
Got your steps in today, huh?

12:00.676 --> 12:02.417
Let's go.

12:02.417 --> 12:04.593
These Zumba classes
are not working.

12:04.593 --> 12:06.334
Yeah, I did all the running.

12:07.814 --> 12:10.425
It's my bike.
I paid cash at a flea market.

12:10.425 --> 12:11.643
Then why'd you run?

12:11.643 --> 12:13.776
You nearly jumped
into the East River.

12:13.776 --> 12:14.995
I got scared.

12:14.995 --> 12:16.344
See, Finn,

12:16.344 --> 12:18.563
we know you're lying
'cause we saw the video.

12:18.563 --> 12:19.608
It's not your bike.

12:19.608 --> 12:21.262
We know
that you stole the bike

12:21.262 --> 12:22.567
from a 14-year-old boy

12:22.567 --> 12:26.658
around the same time
he got shot in the chest.

12:28.225 --> 12:31.968
Wait, I took the bike,
but I didn't shoot anyone.

12:31.968 --> 12:33.709
Look, I'm a singer.

12:33.709 --> 12:35.842
I'm trying to make money.
I wanna put out an album.

12:35.842 --> 12:37.844
So sometimes
when there are packages

12:37.844 --> 12:39.106
sitting
outside people's doors--

12:39.106 --> 12:40.455
You steal things, huh?

12:40.455 --> 12:42.500
Okay,
that's a great business plan.

12:42.500 --> 12:44.154
So you're in the building
for 30 minutes.

12:44.154 --> 12:45.634
What did you do
that whole time?

12:45.634 --> 12:47.984
Just walking around,
looking for stuff to steal,

12:47.984 --> 12:49.246
and I didn't find anything.

12:49.246 --> 12:51.292
So you went in after Eli...

12:51.292 --> 12:52.772
The kid wasn't there,

12:52.772 --> 12:55.122
but his bike was
in the basement.

12:55.122 --> 12:57.864
There was a guy, okay?
He saw me at the bike rack.

12:57.864 --> 13:00.562
A guy?
What did this guy look like?

13:00.562 --> 13:03.478
Latino dude, medium height,

13:03.478 --> 13:05.349
had a big key ring
hanging on his belt.

13:09.005 --> 13:11.051
You lied to us, Virgil.

13:11.051 --> 13:13.662
You said you didn't leave
your apartment after 6:00,

13:13.662 --> 13:16.491
but you were seen out
in the hallway after 10:00.

13:16.491 --> 13:18.058
I didn't think
it was important.

13:18.058 --> 13:19.189
Someone called.
They said

13:19.189 --> 13:20.669
they had a washing machine
jammed up.

13:20.669 --> 13:22.540
I had to go out to fix it.

13:23.890 --> 13:26.066
New door?

13:26.066 --> 13:28.111
Uh, yeah.

13:28.111 --> 13:30.200
New hinges too, huh?

13:30.200 --> 13:31.462
You have a break-in recently?

13:36.206 --> 13:37.207
Well, I'll be damned.

13:37.207 --> 13:38.818
Frank, that looks like blood.

13:40.994 --> 13:43.387
Is there something
you wanna tell us, Virgil?

13:45.041 --> 13:47.957
Dad, just tell them.

13:47.957 --> 13:49.741
Uh, go to your room.

13:51.178 --> 13:52.614
Call your Aunt Lisa.

13:52.614 --> 13:54.311
Tell her you're gonna
spend the night at her place.

13:59.316 --> 14:00.665
Okay.

14:02.189 --> 14:04.931
It was me.

14:04.931 --> 14:07.585
I shot Eli.

14:07.585 --> 14:08.891
I killed him.

14:16.681 --> 14:18.901
I was home, watching TV.

14:18.901 --> 14:21.382
My daughter was in her room,
doing her homework.

14:21.382 --> 14:24.515
Then I heard some banging
on the door.

14:24.515 --> 14:26.169
Banging, not knocking?

14:26.169 --> 14:28.911
The door was moving, like
someone was trying to break in.

14:28.911 --> 14:30.260
And what'd you do?

14:30.260 --> 14:31.914
I told my daughter
to stay in her room.

14:31.914 --> 14:34.308
Then I got my gun
from the closet.

14:34.308 --> 14:36.440
Next thing I know,
the door busted open

14:36.440 --> 14:38.138
and someone was rushing inside.

14:38.138 --> 14:39.617
And it was Eli?

14:39.617 --> 14:40.575
Yeah.

14:40.575 --> 14:42.751
But at the time,
I had no idea.

14:42.751 --> 14:45.058
So I...

14:45.058 --> 14:47.103
I got scared.

14:47.103 --> 14:48.931
I pulled the trigger.

14:48.931 --> 14:51.455
It all happened so fast.

14:51.455 --> 14:54.763
And after you shot him,
what happened?

14:54.763 --> 14:58.332
Once I realized it was Eli.
I-I tried to help.

14:58.332 --> 15:01.030
I tried to give first aid, but...

15:01.030 --> 15:03.250
the kid was dead.

15:03.250 --> 15:05.687
Why didn't you
call the police?

15:05.687 --> 15:08.037
I don't have a permit
for the gun.

15:08.037 --> 15:09.996
I'm a single father.
I can't go to prison.

15:09.996 --> 15:11.780
I can't do that to my daughter.

15:11.780 --> 15:14.522
So you moved the body
to the stairwell?

15:14.522 --> 15:16.002
Yeah.

15:16.002 --> 15:18.308
And I waited a few hours
and called 911.

15:18.308 --> 15:21.572
And you pretended
that you found the body?

15:21.572 --> 15:23.966
Of all the doors
in the building,

15:23.966 --> 15:25.750
why did Eli choose yours?

15:25.750 --> 15:27.230
Maybe because
it's in the basement,

15:27.230 --> 15:28.971
isolated from everyone.

15:28.971 --> 15:32.322
Please, look, I thought someone
was breaking into my apartment.

15:32.322 --> 15:34.194
Okay, we hear you,

15:34.194 --> 15:35.847
and we're gonna check out
everything you're saying.

15:35.847 --> 15:38.198
Is there anything else you
wanna tell us before we leave?

15:38.198 --> 15:40.330
I think
I heard someone with Eli.

15:40.330 --> 15:41.984
I-I didn't see him,

15:41.984 --> 15:45.901
but I heard someone scream,
"Wait! Oh, my God!"

15:45.901 --> 15:47.555
Or something like that.

15:50.253 --> 15:52.560
Is there anything
to back up the super's story?

15:52.560 --> 15:55.128
Well, the M.E. said
that Eli had a fractured ankle,

15:55.128 --> 15:56.868
which is consistent
with kicking in a door.

15:56.868 --> 15:58.131
What about a second person?

15:58.131 --> 16:00.524
I just got access
to Eli's texts.

16:00.524 --> 16:03.136
He'd been communicating
with a guy called "Mad Max."

16:03.136 --> 16:05.007
He's apparently
a digital influencer.

16:05.007 --> 16:07.053
He's got millions of followers.

16:07.053 --> 16:09.664
God, I hate social media.

16:09.664 --> 16:11.579
This is Max,

16:11.579 --> 16:15.061
and this is
from the lobby security video.

16:15.061 --> 16:16.758
Looks like the same guy.

16:16.758 --> 16:19.630
He entered the building
six minutes after Eli got home.

16:19.630 --> 16:21.154
What was he
texting Eli about?

16:21.154 --> 16:22.546
He performs challenges.

16:22.546 --> 16:24.418
Like the ice bowl challenge?

16:25.462 --> 16:26.463
It's all right.

16:26.463 --> 16:28.944
Ice bucket.
- And then some.

16:28.944 --> 16:30.990
More like that movie "Jackass."

16:30.990 --> 16:33.427
Cook chicken in cough syrup,

16:33.427 --> 16:35.472
eat laundry detergent pods.

16:35.472 --> 16:38.388
He told Eli he had the
perfect opportunity for him:

16:38.388 --> 16:40.564
something called
"the door-kick challenge."

16:40.564 --> 16:42.871
He wanted Eli
to kick in someone's door.

16:42.871 --> 16:44.829
Max would film and post it.

16:44.829 --> 16:47.093
Said it would make him
an instant celebrity.

16:47.093 --> 16:49.312
A 14-year-old is dead

16:49.312 --> 16:51.314
because of some kind
of attention grab?

16:51.314 --> 16:52.924
An attention grab
that's also a felony.

16:52.924 --> 16:55.492
Let's get Computer Crimes
to track down his ISP

16:55.492 --> 16:56.928
and his last known address.

16:56.928 --> 16:58.539
If Mad Max was there,

16:58.539 --> 17:00.671
we need to find him
and question him.

17:04.762 --> 17:07.287
So this kid, Mad Max,
lives in a content house?

17:07.287 --> 17:08.549
Yeah,
it's like a live-work space

17:08.549 --> 17:10.246
for social media influencers.

17:10.246 --> 17:11.726
I hear you talking,
and yet,

17:11.726 --> 17:13.902
I don't understand the words
coming out of your mouth.

17:13.902 --> 17:16.687
It's a place where,
kids, they create content,

17:16.687 --> 17:18.298
you know,
or they sing or dance.

17:18.298 --> 17:20.082
Oh, and they kick in
people's doors?

17:20.082 --> 17:21.605
And post it on social media.

17:21.605 --> 17:23.390
They will do anything
for likes.

17:23.390 --> 17:24.739
Just what I need,

17:24.739 --> 17:28.264
another reason
to worry about my kids.

17:34.096 --> 17:36.577
It's really not a good time.
I'll have Max call you.

17:36.577 --> 17:38.144
Yeah, we appreciate that,

17:38.144 --> 17:41.103
but we're gonna need to talk
to Max right now in person.

17:41.103 --> 17:43.279
What is it that you do,
Mister...?

17:43.279 --> 17:44.759
Wheeler.
Jason Wheeler.

17:44.759 --> 17:46.021
I'm the house manager.

17:46.021 --> 17:47.457
Is that like a landlord?

17:47.457 --> 17:50.330
Uh, more like
business manager.

17:51.635 --> 17:53.724
- And you live here?
- I do.

17:53.724 --> 17:55.596
Thank you.

17:58.251 --> 17:59.991
We're here
to talk about Eli Barone.

17:59.991 --> 18:01.428
Who?

18:01.428 --> 18:03.299
14-year-old boy.
Lived with his widowed mom.

18:03.299 --> 18:04.561
Hey, hey.
Give them some space.

18:04.561 --> 18:05.867
You did the door-kick
challenge with him

18:05.867 --> 18:07.216
two nights ago.

18:07.216 --> 18:09.218
And now he's dead.
Ring a bell?

18:09.218 --> 18:10.654
Ooh, don't say anything, Max.

18:10.654 --> 18:13.483
I got a search warrant
for all electronic devices.

18:13.483 --> 18:15.659
So where is your phone
and your computer?

18:15.659 --> 18:17.835
Thanks.
We'll get back to you on that.

18:19.663 --> 18:21.317
We know
you filmed the stunt.

18:21.317 --> 18:23.667
We wanna see the video.

18:23.667 --> 18:25.191
We have
a search warrant team ready

18:25.191 --> 18:27.193
to rip every inch
of this place apart

18:27.193 --> 18:28.498
to find
what they're looking for.

18:28.498 --> 18:30.979
Or you can just hand it over.

18:30.979 --> 18:33.416
Tell 'em you wanna
talk to a lawyer, Max.

18:33.416 --> 18:36.115
- I wanna talk to a lawyer.
- Okay, you can.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.290
Down at the precinct.
Let's go.

18:37.290 --> 18:38.508
Hey.

18:40.206 --> 18:41.816
We have texts
from Eli's phone.

18:41.816 --> 18:43.034
You contacted him.

18:43.034 --> 18:44.079
Wanted to meet that night

18:44.079 --> 18:45.776
to do the door-kick challenge.

18:45.776 --> 18:48.562
We have security footage
of you leaving the building

18:48.562 --> 18:50.738
right after Eli was shot.

18:52.783 --> 18:54.220
Look, I-I didn't--

18:56.526 --> 18:59.660
We're assuming that
your client filmed the stunt

18:59.660 --> 19:01.749
since that was the whole point.

19:01.749 --> 19:04.882
Detective Cosgrove hasn't
been able to locate the video.

19:04.882 --> 19:08.451
If you turn it over,
it could help exculpate him.

19:08.451 --> 19:09.844
Let's just cut to the chase.

19:09.844 --> 19:11.846
My client didn't break
into anyone's apartment.

19:11.846 --> 19:13.064
Eli Barone did.

19:13.064 --> 19:14.196
And he didn't shoot anyone.

19:14.196 --> 19:15.458
Virgil Gilbert did.

19:15.458 --> 19:16.894
Virgil Gilbert
has a legitimate claim

19:16.894 --> 19:18.635
to self-defense.
He was protecting himself

19:18.635 --> 19:20.463
against an intruder
in his home.

19:20.463 --> 19:22.422
Which is why you shouldn't
kick in people's doors.

19:22.422 --> 19:23.814
My client
didn't kick in the door.

19:23.814 --> 19:26.730
No, he recruited a child
to do it.

19:26.730 --> 19:30.995
Which is an inherently
dangerous and reckless act.

19:30.995 --> 19:33.259
You're charging him
with manslaughter?

19:35.261 --> 19:37.393
Max, please stand up.
Stand up.

19:37.393 --> 19:38.742
Put your hands
behind your back.

19:40.570 --> 19:42.790
You're under arrest
for the death of Eli Barone.

19:51.929 --> 19:54.236
Calling docket
ending in 00719.

19:54.236 --> 19:56.934
People v Max Brewer,
charging manslaughter.

19:56.934 --> 19:58.153
How do you plead?

19:58.153 --> 19:59.981
My client pleads not guilty.

19:59.981 --> 20:01.591
And we move
for an immediate dismissal.

20:01.591 --> 20:03.724
This case is a result
of governmental overreach,

20:03.724 --> 20:05.247
an abuse
of prosecutorial discretion.

20:05.247 --> 20:06.596
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

20:06.596 --> 20:07.728
You can submit your application

20:07.728 --> 20:08.946
to the trial court.

20:08.946 --> 20:10.252
Are the People seeking bail?

20:10.252 --> 20:12.254
Absolutely.
We're seeking remand.

20:12.254 --> 20:14.256
Mr. Brewer
has no criminal record.

20:14.256 --> 20:16.258
Oh, and he also has
no roots in the community,

20:16.258 --> 20:18.260
which makes him a flight risk.

20:18.260 --> 20:21.307
Your Honor, this is
a particularly heinous offense.

20:21.307 --> 20:23.961
The defendant
preyed upon a child.

20:23.961 --> 20:25.441
Used him for the sole purpose

20:25.441 --> 20:28.183
of increasing
his social media status.

20:28.183 --> 20:29.793
Now that child is dead.

20:29.793 --> 20:33.057
Max Brewer
is a child himself.

20:33.057 --> 20:34.407
According to the file,
he's two months short

20:34.407 --> 20:36.104
of his 18th birthday.

20:39.150 --> 20:40.717
The defendant
is hereby remanded.

20:40.717 --> 20:43.024
Next case.

20:50.292 --> 20:53.991
We will keep you informed
as we move forward.

20:53.991 --> 20:55.732
Thank you.

20:55.732 --> 20:58.648
Eli was a special kid.

20:58.648 --> 21:01.260
We'll do our best
to get justice for your son.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.348
I promise.

21:08.876 --> 21:10.312
Excuse me.

21:10.312 --> 21:12.271
We're looking for Max Brewer.
Are you his lawyer?

21:12.271 --> 21:15.274
Oh, I'm the prosecutor.
His case was just called.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.058
So you're the one trying
to send my kid to jail?

21:17.058 --> 21:18.929
Phil, stop.

21:18.929 --> 21:21.105
I'm Max's mother.
This is his stepfather.

21:21.105 --> 21:22.933
You should speak
with your son's lawyer.

21:22.933 --> 21:24.935
Max is a good kid.

21:24.935 --> 21:27.590
I'm sure he is.

21:27.590 --> 21:28.983
He was just doing his job.

21:30.767 --> 21:31.899
His job?

21:31.899 --> 21:33.466
Jason,
the guy who runs the house.

21:33.466 --> 21:34.684
he told him to do it.
- Yeah.

21:34.684 --> 21:36.033
Jason is Max's guardian,

21:36.033 --> 21:38.471
so Max did what he said.

21:38.471 --> 21:41.561
The manager of the content
house is Max's guardian?

21:41.561 --> 21:43.476
Manages Max's money too.

21:43.476 --> 21:46.043
Kid just wanted to follow
his dreams, be in the big city.

21:46.043 --> 21:48.394
Kid's got 8 million followers.

21:52.528 --> 21:54.922
<i>Maybe we're looking at this wrong.</i>

21:54.922 --> 21:56.532
Well, I did
the legal analysis.

21:56.532 --> 21:59.230
Max Brewer is responsible
for the death of Eli Barone.

21:59.230 --> 22:02.451
I agree,
but so is Jason Wheeler.

22:02.451 --> 22:03.496
In what way?

22:03.496 --> 22:05.324
Max's parents
live in Florida.

22:05.324 --> 22:08.631
They've handed their teen over
to this social media manager,

22:08.631 --> 22:11.373
who exerts
tremendous influence over him.

22:11.373 --> 22:13.636
Well, that sounds
like bad parenting.

22:13.636 --> 22:15.551
Doesn't make any of them
liable for homicide.

22:15.551 --> 22:17.161
I've done some digging
into this guy.

22:17.161 --> 22:18.772
He put up roadblocks

22:18.772 --> 22:21.383
when Cosgrove and Shaw
went to interview Max.

22:21.383 --> 22:23.951
Wasn't willing to turn over
the video of the door-kick,

22:23.951 --> 22:25.735
which we still haven't found.

22:25.735 --> 22:27.128
There are a lot of kids

22:27.128 --> 22:29.435
who still live
in Wheeler's content house.

22:29.435 --> 22:32.394
He's got them all doing
really dangerous stunts--

22:32.394 --> 22:35.049
putting pennies
into electrical outlets,

22:35.049 --> 22:37.007
asphyxiating themselves.

22:38.748 --> 22:41.403
What's Wheeler's
financial interest in all this?

22:41.403 --> 22:44.058
I'm not sure
of the specifics.

22:44.058 --> 22:45.842
I can go back
to the content house,

22:45.842 --> 22:47.148
try and interview
some of the kids.

22:47.148 --> 22:50.064
This guy has a hold
on those kids.

22:50.064 --> 22:52.414
Try and find people
who used to live there.

22:52.414 --> 22:54.590
See if any of them
are willing to talk.

22:59.769 --> 23:01.989
I was a rock climber.

23:01.989 --> 23:04.078
Started when I was 11.

23:04.078 --> 23:06.863
I used to post videos
on social media.

23:06.863 --> 23:08.474
That's
how Jason discovered you?

23:08.474 --> 23:09.779
Yes.

23:09.779 --> 23:13.130
He offered me a place
in the content house.

23:13.130 --> 23:15.002
Said he'd make me
a household name.

23:15.002 --> 23:16.786
And how old were you?

23:16.786 --> 23:18.571
16.

23:18.571 --> 23:21.965
He'd contact you directly
when you were 16?

23:21.965 --> 23:23.793
Did he ever talk
to your parents?

23:23.793 --> 23:26.187
There were issues at home.

23:27.536 --> 23:31.410
So I figured,
"Why not go live there?"

23:31.410 --> 23:34.543
What kind of stunts
did Jason have you perform?

23:34.543 --> 23:38.765
He wanted me
to scale skyscrapers,

23:38.765 --> 23:40.331
like Spider-Man.

23:40.331 --> 23:43.117
And buildings
got taller and taller...

23:43.117 --> 23:45.380
That's how you broke
your spinal cord?

23:48.731 --> 23:50.472
Jason said
that if I didn't do it,

23:50.472 --> 23:52.909
he said I'd be in violation
of our contract.

23:52.909 --> 23:54.476
He threatened you?

23:57.131 --> 23:59.438
So I did
what he told me to do.

24:01.440 --> 24:04.225
He made me famous, all right.

24:04.225 --> 24:07.489
Do you still have a copy
of that contract?

24:07.489 --> 24:09.404
I think so.

24:12.189 --> 24:14.496
Jason Wheeler imposed
all kinds of rules

24:14.496 --> 24:16.367
as a condition
of living in the house.

24:16.367 --> 24:17.804
What kind of rules?

24:17.804 --> 24:20.415
The kids had to perform
six challenges per month,

24:20.415 --> 24:21.938
and there were requirements

24:21.938 --> 24:24.854
about the amount of danger
necessary for each challenge.

24:24.854 --> 24:29.424
Also everyone had to maintain
at least 7 million followers.

24:29.424 --> 24:31.600
What about
the financial arrangements?

24:31.600 --> 24:34.081
Wheeler kept
70% of the revenue,

24:34.081 --> 24:36.300
and the artists
got the other 30.

24:36.300 --> 24:37.867
And take all the risk?

24:37.867 --> 24:38.999
He was dealing with kids

24:38.999 --> 24:40.827
from difficult
family situations.

24:40.827 --> 24:43.394
They were desperate
for the fame and the money,

24:43.394 --> 24:45.005
and he took advantage of that.

24:45.005 --> 24:46.702
How much money
are we talking about?

24:46.702 --> 24:47.747
Tens of millions.

24:49.270 --> 24:50.532
What are you proposing?

24:50.532 --> 24:53.230
Max Brewer bears
some responsibility

24:53.230 --> 24:54.754
for Eli Barone's death,

24:54.754 --> 24:58.975
but Jason Wheeler ordered him
to perform the challenge.

24:58.975 --> 25:00.542
Wheeler's reckless acts

25:00.542 --> 25:03.589
directly caused the death
of a 14-year-old child.

25:04.851 --> 25:06.853
I think we should charge him
with manslaughter.

25:08.507 --> 25:09.464
Do it.

25:11.814 --> 25:13.903
<i>If you're willing
to testify against Wheeler,</i>

25:13.903 --> 25:16.906
I'll reduce the charge
to reckless endangerment.

25:16.906 --> 25:20.910
Which means you won't have
to serve any prison time.

25:20.910 --> 25:23.086
You'll recommend probation?

25:23.086 --> 25:24.305
What about the bail?

25:24.305 --> 25:26.350
We'll consent to bail,
and he'll be out.

25:26.350 --> 25:28.657
What if I don't wanna
testify against Jason?

25:28.657 --> 25:30.485
You will stay in jail.

25:30.485 --> 25:33.227
Uh, we'll move forward
with the manslaughter charge,

25:33.227 --> 25:36.796
and you risk a sentence
of 15 years.

25:36.796 --> 25:38.449
Jason used you, Max.

25:38.449 --> 25:41.452
It's time to look out
for your own interests.

25:49.330 --> 25:51.201
My client will agree
to cooperate

25:51.201 --> 25:52.768
but only if you dismiss
all charges.

25:52.768 --> 25:55.031
No reckless endangerment,
no probation.

25:55.031 --> 25:57.599
And he walks today.

25:59.775 --> 26:01.385
We still haven't
found the video

26:01.385 --> 26:02.604
of Eli kicking in the door.

26:02.604 --> 26:04.301
Do you have access to that?

26:06.652 --> 26:07.609
Yeah.

26:07.609 --> 26:09.045
All right.

26:09.045 --> 26:10.394
Hand that over to the police.

26:10.394 --> 26:11.831
We got a deal.

26:11.831 --> 26:13.746
Fine.

26:13.746 --> 26:15.617
You know,
Jason isn't a bad guy.

26:15.617 --> 26:17.576
I mean, I was a young punk

26:17.576 --> 26:20.317
when he brought me
to the house,

26:20.317 --> 26:24.060
and he made me famous.

26:24.060 --> 26:25.758
Now everyone knows who I am.

26:33.809 --> 26:36.203
If you're looking for Max,
he isn't here.

26:36.203 --> 26:37.508
Yeah, we know.

26:37.508 --> 26:39.641
Then what do you want?

26:39.641 --> 26:40.990
Well, for starters,
you can put your hands

26:40.990 --> 26:41.991
behind your back.

26:41.991 --> 26:43.210
Jason Wheeler...
- What the hell?

26:43.210 --> 26:44.428
You're under arrest
for manslaughter.

26:44.428 --> 26:45.647
Hey, make sure you get this.

26:45.647 --> 26:46.866
Follow us out.

26:46.866 --> 26:48.781
Ow, ow!
You're hurt--you're hurting me.

26:48.781 --> 26:50.652
You're breaking my wrist.

26:50.652 --> 26:52.828
Be sure to tag the detectives
in the post.

26:52.828 --> 26:54.656
You have the right
to remain silent.

26:54.656 --> 26:56.702
You might wanna
take advantage of that.

27:00.836 --> 27:03.665
When I was a child,
I wanted to be an astronaut.

27:05.885 --> 27:08.496
These days,
kids wanna be famous.

27:08.496 --> 27:11.717
Doesn't matter if they're
famous for curing cancer

27:11.717 --> 27:13.544
or kicking in doors.

27:13.544 --> 27:16.678
Fame is the endgame.

27:16.678 --> 27:19.986
That's--that's problematic,

27:19.986 --> 27:22.902
but what is more problematic

27:22.902 --> 27:25.992
is that there are predatory
adults like the defendant

27:25.992 --> 27:30.692
who used this desire
to manipulate children

27:30.692 --> 27:32.563
in order to make a fast buck.

27:32.563 --> 27:36.567
And then once he'd gotten them
away from their parents,

27:36.567 --> 27:38.134
he used them,

27:38.134 --> 27:43.792
coerced them into performing
dangerous and deadly stunts.

27:43.792 --> 27:47.491
And as a result
of the defendant's actions,

27:47.491 --> 27:49.842
Eli Barone--a child,

27:49.842 --> 27:53.193
an aspiring actor who had
everything to live for--

27:53.193 --> 27:55.761
is dead.

27:55.761 --> 27:59.721
I will ask you
to hold him accountable

27:59.721 --> 28:01.984
and find him guilty.

28:11.167 --> 28:15.781
Eli Barone's death is tragic.

28:15.781 --> 28:19.045
But it's not my client's fault.

28:19.045 --> 28:21.917
Jason Wheeler was
on a business trip

28:21.917 --> 28:23.484
when Eli died.

28:23.484 --> 28:26.835
He had absolutely
nothing to do with it.

28:26.835 --> 28:30.839
If the prosecutor wants
his pound of flesh,

28:30.839 --> 28:32.928
he should go after Max Brewer.

28:32.928 --> 28:37.193
He's the one who recruited Eli
to do the stunt.

28:37.193 --> 28:40.675
Or they should
prosecute Virgil Gilbert,

28:40.675 --> 28:42.982
the man who shot Eli.

28:44.810 --> 28:47.464
Or they should just accept

28:47.464 --> 28:50.990
Eli's death for what it was:

28:50.990 --> 28:54.036
a terrible tragedy.

28:57.561 --> 29:01.087
Mr. Price, you may
call your first witness.

29:02.828 --> 29:04.830
Eli Barone's body
was found

29:04.830 --> 29:06.745
in the stairwell
of the apartment building.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.268
Did you determine
who shot him?

29:08.268 --> 29:10.313
Yeah, the superintendent,
Virgil Gilbert.

29:10.313 --> 29:12.968
Did Mr. Gilbert tell you
why he fired his weapon?

29:12.968 --> 29:15.275
Eli had kicked in his door.

29:15.275 --> 29:17.756
Mr. Gilbert thought
he was an intruder.

29:17.756 --> 29:19.279
Did someone
film the incident?

29:19.279 --> 29:20.802
- Yeah.
- Did you obtain a copy

29:20.802 --> 29:22.586
of that video?
- Objection!

29:22.586 --> 29:23.979
The video was obtained

29:23.979 --> 29:26.329
in violation of the Fourth
Amendment's protections

29:26.329 --> 29:28.375
against unlawful
search and seizures.

29:28.375 --> 29:30.029
Your Honor.

29:30.029 --> 29:32.161
I'll hear you in chambers.

29:37.340 --> 29:41.605
How did Detective Cosgrove
obtain the video, Mr. Price?

29:41.605 --> 29:43.259
It was on Max Brewer's phone,

29:43.259 --> 29:45.131
which he voluntarily
handed over.

29:45.131 --> 29:47.307
It wasn't his to give.

29:47.307 --> 29:51.006
My client purchased that phone.
I have the receipt.

29:51.006 --> 29:54.183
It's the property
of Jason Wheeler's LLC.

29:54.183 --> 29:55.881
Jason loaned it to Max.

29:55.881 --> 29:58.318
He fully expected
to get it back.

29:58.318 --> 30:01.669
Um, the Fourth Amendment
only applies

30:01.669 --> 30:03.932
to property that has been
seized by the government.

30:03.932 --> 30:05.238
By the defense's own assertion,

30:05.238 --> 30:07.022
the police
didn't seize the phone.

30:07.022 --> 30:10.330
Max Brewer, private citizen,
took it.

30:10.330 --> 30:13.376
Mr. Brewer wasn't acting
as a private citizen.

30:13.376 --> 30:14.769
How so?

30:14.769 --> 30:16.423
He was
a cooperating witness,

30:16.423 --> 30:19.687
an agent of the government
when he turned over the phone.

30:19.687 --> 30:21.994
Therefore, the phone
was obtained illegally,

30:21.994 --> 30:24.605
and its contents
must be suppressed.

30:26.302 --> 30:29.088
- I agree with Ms. Wallace.
- Your Honor--

30:29.088 --> 30:31.525
Your witnesses
will be allowed to testify

30:31.525 --> 30:34.963
to what they saw
when the door was kicked in,

30:34.963 --> 30:38.053
but you can't play the video.

30:42.971 --> 30:46.148
You saw Eli Barone
kick in the door?

30:46.148 --> 30:49.717
I didn't know it was him
until after I shot him.

30:49.717 --> 30:51.066
Eli was a good kid.

30:51.066 --> 30:53.199
I feel terrible
about what happened.

30:53.199 --> 30:54.722
Why'd you lie to the police

30:54.722 --> 30:57.986
and tell them that you found
his body in the stairwell?

30:57.986 --> 30:59.596
I didn't have a permit
for the gun.

30:59.596 --> 31:01.424
You've been charged
with that crime?

31:01.424 --> 31:02.904
Yes.

31:02.904 --> 31:05.037
Thank you.
Nothing further.

31:13.262 --> 31:15.482
You liked Eli a lot,
didn't you?

31:15.482 --> 31:17.223
I did.

31:17.223 --> 31:20.356
- Spent a lot of time with him?
- Yes.

31:20.356 --> 31:23.533
- Behind closed doors?
- Wait a minute.

31:23.533 --> 31:24.926
What the hell
are you trying to--

31:24.926 --> 31:27.189
You had romantic feelings
for him, didn't you?

31:27.189 --> 31:28.495
- No.
- Objection.

31:28.495 --> 31:32.064
This is baseless
and inflammatory accusation.

31:32.064 --> 31:33.674
Overruled.

31:33.674 --> 31:35.328
Please answer the question.

31:35.328 --> 31:38.635
No, it wasn't like that.
Not even close.

31:38.635 --> 31:39.636
Really?

31:43.945 --> 31:45.381
Objection.

31:45.381 --> 31:47.253
Overruled.

31:47.253 --> 31:48.776
Okay, that's not
what it looks like.

31:48.776 --> 31:50.560
I was just teaching him
how to hold a baseball bat.

31:54.738 --> 31:56.088
Okay, his father just died.

31:56.088 --> 31:57.611
I was consoling him.

31:57.611 --> 32:00.527
Sir, isn't it true
that Eli kicked in your door

32:00.527 --> 32:03.791
because he wanted to confront
you about what you did to him,

32:03.791 --> 32:06.576
and you shot him because
you didn't want people to know?

32:06.576 --> 32:08.013
Objection.
This is outrageous.

32:08.013 --> 32:09.971
Your objection is overruled.

32:09.971 --> 32:12.278
Answer the question.

32:12.278 --> 32:14.671
Look,
I felt bad for Eli, okay?

32:14.671 --> 32:17.805
I lost my own father
at a young age.

32:17.805 --> 32:19.981
I just treated him like family.

32:19.981 --> 32:21.983
Period.

32:23.767 --> 32:25.987
Nothing further.

32:25.987 --> 32:27.641
Given the hour,
this is a good time

32:27.641 --> 32:29.251
to recess for the day.

32:29.251 --> 32:32.515
We'll reconvene tomorrow
at 9:00 a.m.

32:33.777 --> 32:36.432
I can't believe
the judge let her do that,

32:36.432 --> 32:38.521
as if that guy
hasn't been through enough.

32:38.521 --> 32:41.481
Let's make sure Max Brewer
is ready to go tomorrow.

32:47.791 --> 32:48.792
Hey, Max.

32:51.447 --> 32:53.841
ADA wants us to give you
a ride to her office.

32:53.841 --> 32:55.060
What for?

32:55.060 --> 32:56.670
To prepare you
for court tomorrow.

32:56.670 --> 32:58.454
It won't take long.

32:58.454 --> 33:00.326
We were just gonna grab a bite.

33:00.326 --> 33:02.197
Yeah, we can stop for food
on the way there.

33:02.197 --> 33:04.156
Maybe we can meet
in the morning.

33:04.156 --> 33:06.506
Max, were you planning
on going somewhere?

33:06.506 --> 33:08.987
We've decided
to take Max home.

33:08.987 --> 33:10.684
To Florida?

33:10.684 --> 33:12.251
We've got other kids.

33:12.251 --> 33:14.949
Yeah, well, this kid has
to be in court in the morning.

33:14.949 --> 33:16.168
I don't wanna
do that anymore.

33:16.168 --> 33:17.734
Yeah,
that's not how it works.

33:17.734 --> 33:20.520
See, he was subpoenaed,
so he has to appear.

33:20.520 --> 33:22.478
And it's part
of your cooperation agreement.

33:22.478 --> 33:24.263
So if you don't show up,
that goes away.

33:24.263 --> 33:26.352
Do you get that?
- We talked to our lawyer.

33:26.352 --> 33:28.354
She said we don't have to
cooperate if we don't want to.

33:28.354 --> 33:30.486
Yeah, let me guess,
you spoke with the same lawyer

33:30.486 --> 33:32.227
who represents Jason Wheeler?

33:32.227 --> 33:33.359
That's right.

33:33.359 --> 33:34.708
Yeah, come on.
Let's go, Max.

33:34.708 --> 33:36.188
Okay, leave him alone.

33:36.188 --> 33:37.232
We promise to get him
to court tomorrow.

33:37.232 --> 33:39.365
Step aside.
Out of the way.

33:39.365 --> 33:41.715
We would love to believe you,
but we don't.

33:41.715 --> 33:43.369
Max,
we're holding you for court

33:43.369 --> 33:45.023
on a material witness order.

33:45.023 --> 33:46.589
Let's go.

33:54.075 --> 33:55.250
Nolan.

33:55.250 --> 33:57.383
Max Brewer is in custody,

33:57.383 --> 33:58.775
but he's holding firm.

33:58.775 --> 34:00.603
Yes, I think I know why.

34:00.603 --> 34:01.952
Cosgrove found out

34:01.952 --> 34:05.521
that Max's parents went
to Rikers last night.

34:05.521 --> 34:06.783
To see Jason Wheeler?

34:06.783 --> 34:08.872
They spent an hour
and 47 minutes with him.

34:08.872 --> 34:12.006
So I subpoenaed
everyone's bank records.

34:12.006 --> 34:14.791
Three hours after
Max's parents left Rikers,

34:14.791 --> 34:17.098
there was a money transfer.
- Of course there was.

34:17.098 --> 34:19.840
A million dollars wired
from the business entity,

34:19.840 --> 34:21.363
controlled by Jason Wheeler,

34:21.363 --> 34:23.104
to Max's parents' account.

34:24.975 --> 34:28.109
So you're asserting
that the money was a bribe?

34:28.109 --> 34:31.025
That is the only logical
conclusion one can draw.

34:31.025 --> 34:33.071
A million dollars
changed hands,

34:33.071 --> 34:36.161
and lo and behold, Max Brewer
is refusing to cooperate?

34:36.161 --> 34:37.466
That wasn't a bribe.

34:37.466 --> 34:39.642
It was payment of money
owed to the family.

34:39.642 --> 34:40.687
Money for what?

34:40.687 --> 34:41.818
Max's participation

34:41.818 --> 34:43.168
in the content house.

34:43.168 --> 34:46.562
His earnings, his share
of the sponsorship deals.

34:46.562 --> 34:47.911
He's still a minor,

34:47.911 --> 34:49.565
so his share was paid
to his parents

34:49.565 --> 34:50.914
to hold for him in trust.

34:50.914 --> 34:52.220
Can you back this up?

34:52.220 --> 34:54.309
There was
a preexisting contract.

34:55.919 --> 34:58.139
It's all
in the financial agreement,

34:58.139 --> 35:00.010
which predates
my client's arrest.

35:00.010 --> 35:02.883
This is nothing but a
bold-faced to subvert our case.

35:02.883 --> 35:04.276
What are you
asking me to do?

35:04.276 --> 35:06.104
Instruct the jury
that the reason

35:06.104 --> 35:07.975
our key witness
is refusing to cooperate

35:07.975 --> 35:09.933
is the defense
engaged in bribery

35:09.933 --> 35:11.109
and witness tampering,

35:11.109 --> 35:12.936
hold the defendant in contempt,

35:12.936 --> 35:15.983
and give me time to issue
a superseding indictment.

35:15.983 --> 35:17.593
The defense has given

35:17.593 --> 35:19.987
a legitimate explanation
for the payment,

35:19.987 --> 35:22.337
and it's supported
by documents.

35:22.337 --> 35:24.470
So your application is denied.

35:24.470 --> 35:27.690
The show will go on.

35:27.690 --> 35:29.736
We had a deal.

35:29.736 --> 35:31.564
I changed my mind.

35:31.564 --> 35:33.131
You signed
a cooperation agreement.

35:33.131 --> 35:35.437
It's binding and enforceable.

35:37.700 --> 35:40.181
There will be consequences.
Do you not understand that?

35:40.181 --> 35:41.922
Max is willing
to plead guilty.

35:41.922 --> 35:43.141
Reckless endangerment.

35:43.141 --> 35:45.055
That's not
on the table anymore.

35:45.055 --> 35:47.710
You don't seem
to hear what I'm saying.

35:47.710 --> 35:49.451
I will revoke your bail,

35:49.451 --> 35:50.974
send you back to Rikers,

35:50.974 --> 35:53.977
and move forward
on a charge of manslaughter.

35:53.977 --> 35:55.327
They're just blowing smoke.

35:55.327 --> 35:57.677
No, we're serious!

35:59.896 --> 36:02.160
Well, I'm sorry.
I can't do it.

36:03.291 --> 36:04.640
I know you think
it's about the money,

36:04.640 --> 36:06.599
but it's not.

36:06.599 --> 36:09.689
No one thinks
Jason should go to jail.

36:09.689 --> 36:11.169
If I testify against him,

36:11.169 --> 36:13.127
the content house
will turn against me.

36:13.127 --> 36:15.695
I'll lose all my followers.

36:15.695 --> 36:17.479
Don't worry, Max.

36:17.479 --> 36:20.613
Jury ain't gonna blame you
for any of this. I promise.

36:20.613 --> 36:22.397
Max didn't mean
for anyone to die.

36:22.397 --> 36:24.965
The jury will see that.

36:24.965 --> 36:26.662
This may not be
about money for Max,

36:26.662 --> 36:27.924
but it is for you.

36:27.924 --> 36:30.013
You are selling out
your child's future.

36:30.013 --> 36:31.841
He could go to prison
for 15 years.

36:31.841 --> 36:33.103
I think we're done here.

36:35.976 --> 36:37.717
Don't be foolish, all right?

36:37.717 --> 36:39.109
This isn't the virtual world.

36:39.109 --> 36:40.850
This is the real world.

36:40.850 --> 36:42.200
If you don't testify,

36:42.200 --> 36:45.855
I am going to prosecute you
for manslaughter.

36:51.731 --> 36:53.428
<i>What are you gonna do?</i>

36:53.428 --> 36:54.864
<i>I don't know.</i>

36:54.864 --> 36:57.606
But I'm not gonna let
an ill-advised teenager

36:57.606 --> 37:01.262
derail a homicide case
against a predatory offender.

37:01.262 --> 37:04.874
This guy preys
on vulnerable, young kids.

37:04.874 --> 37:07.703
He knowingly
puts their lives in jeopardy.

37:07.703 --> 37:09.879
You know, he doesn't care
if they get seriously injured

37:09.879 --> 37:11.925
or die.
- No argument here.

37:11.925 --> 37:14.319
Wheeler is a threat
to public safety.

37:14.319 --> 37:17.365
Problem is you've lost
your causal connection.

37:17.365 --> 37:21.630
You can't hook Wheeler
without Max Brewer's testimony.

37:21.630 --> 37:24.198
Might be time to offer a deal.

37:24.198 --> 37:25.939
Yeah, well, beyond that,

37:25.939 --> 37:27.897
Wheeler has no reason
to entertain a plea.

37:27.897 --> 37:30.770
The odds of acquittal
are clearly in his favor.

37:30.770 --> 37:33.903
Then find something
or someone

37:33.903 --> 37:36.254
to use as leverage against him.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.910
I signed a nondisclosure.

37:40.910 --> 37:42.825
No, that doesn't matter.

37:42.825 --> 37:46.264
It's not enforceable
in criminal court.

37:46.264 --> 37:47.787
Maybe...

37:49.354 --> 37:52.879
But my family
doesn't have a lot of money,

37:52.879 --> 37:56.578
and Jason is paying
for my healthcare, so...

37:56.578 --> 37:59.799
Think about all the other
kids you'll be helping,

37:59.799 --> 38:01.279
the ones who've been hurt

38:01.279 --> 38:04.369
and the ones who could
be hurt in the future.

38:04.369 --> 38:07.633
If anyone knows what a monster
this guy is, it's you.

38:07.633 --> 38:11.027
You can stop him.

38:13.465 --> 38:14.814
Okay.

38:14.814 --> 38:17.295
Yes.

38:17.295 --> 38:19.993
But I don't really understand
how I can help.

38:19.993 --> 38:23.170
I didn't see
that kid, Eli, get killed.

38:23.170 --> 38:26.347
That doesn't matter.
It's not what we need you for.

38:31.047 --> 38:34.877
This is a sworn affidavit
from Amber Koenig,

38:34.877 --> 38:37.880
the woman you forced
to climb a skyscraper.

38:37.880 --> 38:39.099
I didn't force her
to do anything.

38:39.099 --> 38:40.187
She wanted to do it.

38:40.187 --> 38:41.841
I have the contract.

38:41.841 --> 38:43.408
She signed it
when she was a minor

38:43.408 --> 38:45.932
without anyone
to properly advise her.

38:45.932 --> 38:47.325
It's totally one-sided.

38:47.325 --> 38:50.415
Huge penalties for failing
to generate followers.

38:50.415 --> 38:53.069
Requirements
of the level of danger

38:53.069 --> 38:54.680
and the stunts
she had to perform.

38:54.680 --> 38:56.116
An eviction clause.

38:56.116 --> 38:57.813
A nondisclosure agreement.

38:57.813 --> 38:58.988
Yeah, she also told us

38:58.988 --> 39:01.687
about other kids
who have bene injured.

39:01.687 --> 39:03.341
In fact,
I just got off the phone

39:03.341 --> 39:05.604
with the parents of a young man
who was severely injured

39:05.604 --> 39:08.955
during one of your so-called
blackout challenges.

39:08.955 --> 39:11.740
He's been in a coma
for the past four months.

39:11.740 --> 39:14.090
Here are their affidavits.

39:14.090 --> 39:16.310
I'm guessing
there are a lot more.

39:16.310 --> 39:18.530
And we are
just getting started.

39:25.058 --> 39:26.842
What's your offer?

39:26.842 --> 39:28.888
Plead guilty to man two.

39:28.888 --> 39:31.194
Serve ten years.
- Ten years?

39:31.194 --> 39:33.109
And in exchange,
I will agree

39:33.109 --> 39:36.156
not to move forward
on any other cases.

39:36.156 --> 39:37.723
And if I say no?

39:37.723 --> 39:40.029
Then we'll keep investigating.

39:40.029 --> 39:42.292
And some day very soon,
I will find a way

39:42.292 --> 39:45.557
to charge you
with several class A felonies.

39:45.557 --> 39:47.080
I will do my very best

39:47.080 --> 39:50.518
to make sure you spend the
rest of your life in prison.

39:54.957 --> 39:57.220
Mr. Wheeler,
I find that your plea

39:57.220 --> 40:00.223
has been made knowingly
and voluntarily,

40:00.223 --> 40:03.488
and I accept
the agreed-upon recommendation.

40:03.488 --> 40:07.927
I hereby sentence you
to serve not less than five,

40:07.927 --> 40:12.584
not more than ten years in
a state correctional facility.

40:20.722 --> 40:22.158
Thank you.

40:24.117 --> 40:26.598
We know
this won't bring Eli back.

40:26.598 --> 40:29.601
Maybe it'll give you
some sense of closure.

40:34.954 --> 40:37.478
What are you gonna do
about Max?

40:37.478 --> 40:39.088
Prosecute him.

40:39.088 --> 40:41.003
For manslaughter?

40:41.003 --> 40:43.223
A deal's a deal.
