WEBVTT

00:02.085 --> 00:05.077
(insects chirping)

01:12.655 --> 01:14.646
(door opens)

01:16.201 --> 01:17.816
(door closes)

01:30.131 --> 01:33.544
(door creaks)

01:39.808 --> 01:44.302
(crashing)

02:06.918 --> 02:08.499
Gabriel:
Just checking.

02:12.549 --> 02:13.880
(thumps)

02:14.050 --> 02:17.542
(clanging)

02:31.234 --> 02:33.976
(Gabriel breathing shakily)

02:41.369 --> 02:42.905
(gate closes)

02:43.079 --> 02:45.536
(Gabriel exhales deeply)

02:45.707 --> 02:48.699
(insects chirping)

03:02.599 --> 03:06.012
(engine whirs)

03:07.854 --> 03:10.721
(music playing)

03:48.311 --> 03:49.801
No! No way in hell.

03:49.979 --> 03:51.765
That was not the deal.

03:51.940 --> 03:54.602
You people swore
you could take the Saviors out,

03:54.776 --> 03:56.141
and you failed.

03:56.319 --> 03:59.482
So any arrangement we had
is now done--

03:59.656 --> 04:02.022
null and void, huh?

04:02.200 --> 04:05.658
We aren't trade partners,
we aren't friends,

04:05.828 --> 04:07.329
and we never met.

04:07.497 --> 04:08.486
Hmm?

04:08.665 --> 04:10.371
We don't know each other.

04:14.337 --> 04:16.328
I owe you nothing.

04:16.506 --> 04:18.462
In fact, you owe me
for taking in the refugees,

04:18.633 --> 04:19.964
at great personal risk.

04:20.134 --> 04:21.965
Oh, you were very brave
staying in here

04:22.136 --> 04:24.001
while Maggie and Sasha
saved this place.

04:24.180 --> 04:25.511
Your courage
was inspiring.

04:25.682 --> 04:27.513
Hey,
don't you work for me?

04:27.684 --> 04:28.799
Aren't we friends?

04:28.977 --> 04:31.218
Gregory,
we already started this.

04:31.396 --> 04:33.136
- You started it.
- We did.

04:33.314 --> 04:34.520
And we're gonna win.

04:34.691 --> 04:36.022
These are killers.

04:36.192 --> 04:37.693
Is this
how you want to live?

04:37.860 --> 04:39.816
Under their thumb,
killing your people?

04:39.988 --> 04:41.694
Sometimes
we don't get to choose

04:41.864 --> 04:42.990
what our life looks like.

04:43.157 --> 04:44.363
Sometimes, Ricky,

04:44.534 --> 04:46.741
you have to count
the blessings you have.

04:46.911 --> 04:48.993
How many people
can we spare?

04:49.163 --> 04:51.245
How many people here
can fight?

04:51.416 --> 04:53.031
"We"? (scoffs)

04:53.209 --> 04:55.700
I don't even know how many
people we have, Margaret.

04:55.878 --> 04:57.254
And does it even matter?

04:57.422 --> 04:58.411
I mean... (scoffs)

04:58.589 --> 05:00.375
...w-w-what are
you gonna do?

05:00.550 --> 05:03.087
Start a platoon
of sorghum farmers?

05:03.261 --> 05:04.671
'Cause that's what we got.

05:04.846 --> 05:07.337
They grow things.
They're not gonna want to fight.

05:07.515 --> 05:08.595
Tara: You're wrong.

05:08.766 --> 05:12.224
When people have the chance to do
the right thing, they usually step up.

05:12.395 --> 05:14.010
- I mean, peoplejust--
- L-let me stop you

05:14.188 --> 05:16.565
before you break into song,
okay?

05:16.733 --> 05:18.769
(clears throat)
And, by the way,

05:18.943 --> 05:21.059
who would train
all this cannon fodder?

05:21.237 --> 05:22.568
- Sasha: lwill.
- Rosita: Give me a week.

05:22.739 --> 05:25.731
(sing-song voice)
Rhetorical, okay?

05:25.908 --> 05:27.284
(normal voice)
I don't want to know.

05:27.452 --> 05:29.113
I never want to hear another
word about any of it, ever.

05:29.287 --> 05:31.573
Would we be better off
without the Saviors,

05:31.748 --> 05:34.706
- yes or no?
- Yeah. Sure. Okay.

05:34.876 --> 05:38.209
So, what will you do
to fix the problem?

05:38.379 --> 05:40.415
I didn't say we had a problem.
You did.

05:40.590 --> 05:43.047
And what happens
outside of my purview

05:43.217 --> 05:44.923
is outside
of my purview.

05:45.094 --> 05:46.083
What the hell, man?

05:46.262 --> 05:48.378
You're either with us
or you ain't.

05:48.556 --> 05:49.716
You're sitting over there

05:49.891 --> 05:52.098
talking out of
both sides of your mouth.

05:53.770 --> 05:57.604
Well, l-- I think I've made
my position very clear.

05:57.774 --> 06:01.767
And I want to thank all of you
for not being here today

06:01.944 --> 06:04.435
and not
having this meeting with me

06:04.614 --> 06:07.947
or-- or being seen
on your way out.

06:08.117 --> 06:11.325
In other words,
go out the back.

06:20.963 --> 06:23.625
- Walking ballsack.
- Wanna knock that idiot's teeth out.

06:26.427 --> 06:28.133
Yeah, well,
we don't need him anyway.

06:28.304 --> 06:30.090
Yeah, that's right.

06:30.264 --> 06:32.300
'Cause we have Maggie, Sasha,
and Jesus here.

06:32.475 --> 06:33.965
- (door opens)
- Maggie: And...

06:34.143 --> 06:35.474
Enid.

06:35.645 --> 06:37.510
- Hey, um--
- Sasha: What's wrong?

06:37.688 --> 06:38.848
Nothing.

06:39.023 --> 06:40.263
Just"

06:40.441 --> 06:41.601
(chuckles)

06:41.776 --> 06:43.107
Come outside.

06:54.831 --> 06:56.162
What's going on?

06:56.332 --> 06:57.538
Bertie: Hey.

06:57.708 --> 07:01.166
So, if you don't remember,
l'm Bertie.

07:01.337 --> 07:03.874
And I owe my life to you all,
twice over.

07:04.048 --> 07:05.959
A bunch of us do.

07:06.134 --> 07:08.125
Enid says
that you want Gregory

07:08.302 --> 07:09.462
to get us to fight the Saviors
with you.

07:09.637 --> 07:10.797
Is that true?

07:10.972 --> 07:13.463
- Yes.
- Do you think we can win,

07:13.641 --> 07:15.177
that we really
could beat them?

07:15.351 --> 07:17.342
Us?

07:17.520 --> 07:18.726
Maggie: I do.

07:20.356 --> 07:23.018
(sighs)

07:23.192 --> 07:24.648
Well, Enid says
you could show us the way.

07:24.819 --> 07:26.184
- I'm ready.
- Man: Me too.

07:26.362 --> 07:27.351
- Yeah.
- Let's do this.

07:27.530 --> 07:28.565
- Let's do it.
- I'm in.

07:34.704 --> 07:36.945
- Michonne: It's a start.
- Sasha: We'll get more.

07:37.123 --> 07:39.409
- It still won't be enough.
- Rosita: No, it won't.

07:39.584 --> 07:41.700
Daryl: Well,
we find the right stuff,

07:41.878 --> 07:43.994
then maybe
we don't need the numbers.

07:44.172 --> 07:46.504
Blow 'em up,
burn 'em to the ground.

07:46.674 --> 07:48.710
Tara: You said there weren't just
soldiers with the Saviors,

07:48.885 --> 07:50.375
that there were
workers there.

07:50.553 --> 07:51.884
People didn't
have a choice.

07:52.054 --> 07:53.510
Daryl: We gotta win.

07:53.681 --> 07:56.388
Rick: We need more hands,
another group.

07:56.559 --> 07:57.890
Negan has outposts.

07:58.060 --> 08:00.346
The geography,
the distance works against us.

08:00.521 --> 08:02.022
We gotta get back.

08:02.190 --> 08:04.226
If they come looking for Daryl,
we need to be there.

08:04.400 --> 08:05.731
You don't
have to get back.

08:06.736 --> 08:08.397
Not yet.

08:10.364 --> 08:13.071
It's one of theirs,
long range.

08:13.242 --> 08:15.733
We can listen in,
keep track of them.

08:15.912 --> 08:18.745
Michonne: So, if we're not going back,
what are we doing, then?

08:18.915 --> 08:20.871
I think it's time
we introduced you to Ezekiel.

08:21.876 --> 08:24.583
King Ezekiel.

08:24.754 --> 08:25.960
King?

08:33.804 --> 08:36.932
(walker growling)

08:37.099 --> 08:38.760
(vehicle approaches)

08:49.946 --> 08:51.527
(engine shuts off)

08:54.784 --> 08:56.775
Rick:
It's called "the Kingdom"?

08:56.953 --> 08:58.193
Jesus: Yeah.

08:59.455 --> 09:01.116
I didn't name it.

09:02.833 --> 09:04.243
How much farther?

09:04.418 --> 09:07.455
Well, technically,
we're already here.

09:07.630 --> 09:10.121
I mean, we're always here,

09:10.299 --> 09:13.587
but here we are--
at the Kingdom.

09:13.761 --> 09:16.343
- Well, its outer edge.
- (truck door opens)

09:16.514 --> 09:19.472
Hey, what the hell
we waitin' on?

09:19.642 --> 09:21.257
Waiting for them.

09:23.020 --> 09:26.979
(hoofbeats approaching)

09:27.149 --> 09:28.764
(horse snorts)

09:28.943 --> 09:30.683
Alvaro:
Who dares to trespass

09:30.861 --> 09:33.113
on the sovereign land
of the--

09:34.782 --> 09:35.817
Oh, shit.

09:35.992 --> 09:37.402
Jesus, is that you?

09:43.541 --> 09:44.997
Who are all these people,
Paul?

09:45.167 --> 09:46.703
Hi, Richard.

09:46.877 --> 09:48.538
Nice to see you.

09:48.713 --> 09:50.123
It's good
to see you, too.

09:50.298 --> 09:53.131
Your friends,
who are they?

09:53.301 --> 09:54.962
This is Rick Grimes.

09:55.136 --> 09:58.799
He's the leader
of a like-minded community.

09:58.973 --> 10:00.713
These are some of his people.

10:00.891 --> 10:04.224
We would like to request
an audience with King Ezekiel.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.524
Richard:
Get out of the car.

10:16.741 --> 10:18.356
(truck door opens)

10:18.534 --> 10:21.822
You say they're a...
like-minded community.

10:21.996 --> 10:23.361
Like-minded how?

10:23.539 --> 10:28.033
We live, we trade,
we fight the dead.

10:28.210 --> 10:29.996
Sometimes others.

10:35.843 --> 10:36.923
Line up.

10:37.094 --> 10:38.834
Daryl: Okay.
This is a waste of time.

10:39.013 --> 10:40.253
Come on. Let's go.

10:40.431 --> 10:42.547
Maybe you're right.

10:42.725 --> 10:45.387
The King is a busy man.

10:45.561 --> 10:47.722
And it's a dangerous world.

10:47.897 --> 10:50.559
We don't usually allow
a pack of strangers

10:50.733 --> 10:52.223
to waltz through our door.

10:52.401 --> 10:54.687
We want to make the world
less dangerous,

10:54.862 --> 10:56.853
and we are all here
to show the King

10:57.031 --> 10:58.896
how serious
we are about that.

10:59.909 --> 11:00.944
The car stays outside.

11:01.118 --> 11:02.733
You gotta hand over
yourguns.

11:02.912 --> 11:05.244
We only have two.

11:12.713 --> 11:14.123
Okay.

11:14.298 --> 11:15.913
Follow me.

11:26.560 --> 11:29.768
Before we go in,

11:29.939 --> 11:32.476
you have
a brain and a backbone,

11:32.650 --> 11:35.392
so I'm talking to you,
not Gregory.

11:35.569 --> 11:37.821
Whatever you're trying
to start here,

11:37.988 --> 11:40.070
another protection pact,
a trade,

11:40.241 --> 11:44.405
none of it matters if we don't start
dealing with the real problem--

11:44.578 --> 11:46.318
the Saviors.

11:47.623 --> 11:50.615
You know, Richard,
I've never seen you smile.

11:50.793 --> 11:52.875
I think
that's gonna change today.

11:56.674 --> 11:59.586
(indistinct conversations)

12:16.026 --> 12:18.017
They have the numbers.

12:18.195 --> 12:19.981
But can they fight?

12:20.156 --> 12:21.566
Oh, they can fight.

12:23.451 --> 12:24.736
Maybe.

12:38.174 --> 12:39.789
Morgan?

12:45.639 --> 12:46.719
Hey.

12:50.352 --> 12:51.637
Hi.

12:55.816 --> 12:58.353
Richard:
How do you know each other?

12:58.527 --> 13:01.143
We go back
to the start.

13:01.322 --> 13:04.064
Well, the King
is ready to see you.

13:10.706 --> 13:12.662
- Did you find Carol?
- I did, yeah.

13:12.833 --> 13:14.369
Where is she?
Is she okay?

13:14.543 --> 13:16.625
She was here,
and then she left.

13:18.047 --> 13:20.379
You know, she wasn't too happy,
me following her.

13:20.549 --> 13:24.133
She wanted to get away from us,
from everyone.

13:25.554 --> 13:28.045
But when I found her,
she was shot.

13:28.224 --> 13:29.384
It was just a graze.
I got her back here.

13:29.558 --> 13:32.220
They got doctors.
They're good.

13:32.394 --> 13:34.726
Was it them?

13:34.897 --> 13:36.558
It was.

13:36.732 --> 13:38.097
She had crossed
with some of them,

13:38.275 --> 13:40.231
and one of them followed her,
tried to kill her,

13:40.402 --> 13:41.983
but I stopped him.

13:46.283 --> 13:47.864
I killed him.

13:50.037 --> 13:53.746
I had to.

13:53.916 --> 13:56.908
Carol was here.

13:57.086 --> 13:58.792
She got help.

13:58.963 --> 14:00.703
Now she's gone.

14:08.138 --> 14:10.390
(growling)

14:13.727 --> 14:16.104
Ezekiel: Jesus!

14:16.272 --> 14:18.479
It pleases me to see you,
old friend.

14:18.649 --> 14:21.061
- It pleases him, indeed!
- Jerry.

14:22.653 --> 14:25.611
Tell me, what news do you bring
good King Ezekiel?

14:25.781 --> 14:28.113
Are these new allies
you've brought me?

14:28.284 --> 14:30.275
Indeed, they are,
Your Majesty.

14:30.452 --> 14:31.658
This is...

14:33.622 --> 14:35.237
Oh, right.
I forgot to mention that--

14:35.416 --> 14:36.496
Yeah, a tiger.

14:39.920 --> 14:43.412
Jesus: This is Rick Grimes,
the leader of Alexandria,

14:43.591 --> 14:45.923
and these are
some of his people.

14:46.093 --> 14:49.301
Ezekiel: I welcome you all
to the Kingdom, good travelers.

14:49.471 --> 14:51.507
Now, what brings you
to our fair land?

14:51.682 --> 14:55.266
Why do you seek an audience
with the King?

14:58.772 --> 15:00.103
Ezekiel--

15:00.274 --> 15:03.357
King... Ezekiel.

15:05.613 --> 15:09.197
Alexandria, the Hilltop...

15:10.784 --> 15:12.649
and the Kingdom--

15:12.828 --> 15:17.948
all three of our communities
have something in common.

15:18.125 --> 15:20.616
We all serve the Saviors.

15:20.794 --> 15:24.537
Alexandria already
fought them once,

15:24.715 --> 15:26.046
and we won.

15:26.216 --> 15:27.672
We thought
we took out the threat,

15:27.843 --> 15:31.006
but we didn't know then
what we know now.

15:31.180 --> 15:33.136
We only beat one outpost.

15:33.307 --> 15:34.968
We've been told
you have a deal with them,

15:35.142 --> 15:36.552
that you know them.

15:36.727 --> 15:41.642
Then you know they rule
through violence and fear.

15:41.815 --> 15:43.976
Your Majesty,
I only told them of the--

15:44.151 --> 15:47.894
our deal with the Saviors
is not known among my people--

15:48.072 --> 15:49.562
for good cause.

15:51.158 --> 15:52.989
We made you a party
to that secret

15:53.160 --> 15:55.071
when you told us
of the Hilltop's own travails,

15:55.245 --> 15:56.826
but we did not expect you
to share--

15:56.997 --> 15:58.077
We can help each other.

15:58.248 --> 16:00.830
Don't interrupt the King.

16:01.001 --> 16:04.539
We brought you
into our confidence.

16:04.713 --> 16:06.374
Why did you break it?

16:06.548 --> 16:09.676
Because I want you
to hear Rick's plans.

16:12.429 --> 16:16.672
And what plans have you,
Rick Grimes of Alexandria?

16:16.850 --> 16:20.263
We came to ask the Kingdom,
to ask you,

16:20.437 --> 16:23.554
tojoin us
in fighting the Saviors,

16:23.732 --> 16:26.724
fighting for freedom
for all of us.

16:26.902 --> 16:30.520
What you are asking
is very serious.

16:30.698 --> 16:34.407
Several of our people--
good people--

16:34.576 --> 16:37.283
were killed by the Saviors,
brutally.

16:37.454 --> 16:38.864
Who?

16:41.291 --> 16:43.122
Rosita: Abraham.

16:43.293 --> 16:46.251
And Glenn.

16:46.422 --> 16:49.209
Spencer, Olivia.

16:49.383 --> 16:50.873
Eugene was taken.

16:51.051 --> 16:52.257
They took Daryl.

16:52.428 --> 16:53.759
He escaped.

16:53.929 --> 16:56.466
Every second he's out here,
he's a target.

16:59.810 --> 17:01.471
You gonna say
you were right?

17:01.645 --> 17:03.226
No.

17:03.397 --> 17:06.434
I'm...

17:06.608 --> 17:09.099
I'm just real sorry
they're gone.

17:09.278 --> 17:12.270
Rick: Negan murdered
Glenn and Abraham,

17:12.448 --> 17:14.404
beat them to death.

17:14.575 --> 17:16.281
Sasha:
Terrorized the Hilltop,

17:16.452 --> 17:19.615
set loose walkers
just to make a point.

17:19.788 --> 17:22.279
I used to think the deal was
something we could live with.

17:22.458 --> 17:24.574
A lot of us did.

17:24.752 --> 17:27.084
But that's changing.

17:27.254 --> 17:29.666
So let's change the world,
Your Majesty.

17:29.840 --> 17:33.799
I want to be honest
about what we're asking.

17:33.969 --> 17:38.463
My people are strong,
but there's not enough of us.

17:38.640 --> 17:41.803
We don't have guns--
not enough, at least.

17:41.977 --> 17:44.639
Not a lot of weapons,
period.

17:44.813 --> 17:46.974
We have people.

17:47.149 --> 17:49.640
And weapons.

17:49.818 --> 17:53.777
If we strike first,
together, we can beat them.

17:56.867 --> 17:58.323
Your Majesty,

17:58.494 --> 18:00.610
no more waiting
for things to get worse

18:00.788 --> 18:02.449
beyond
what we can handle.

18:03.791 --> 18:07.124
We set things right.

18:07.294 --> 18:09.535
The time is now.

18:17.304 --> 18:20.671
Morgan, what say you?

18:24.353 --> 18:25.968
Me?

18:26.980 --> 18:28.971
Speak.

18:31.151 --> 18:33.858
People will die.

18:34.029 --> 18:35.985
A lot of people,
and not just the Saviors.

18:36.156 --> 18:37.316
It...

18:41.495 --> 18:43.076
If we can find
another way,

18:43.247 --> 18:44.987
we have to.

18:45.165 --> 18:47.247
Maybe it's just
about Negan--

18:47.417 --> 18:49.874
just capturing him,
holding him.

18:50.045 --> 18:52.161
Maybe...

18:54.716 --> 18:57.879
- The hour grows late.
- (Shiva growls)

18:58.053 --> 19:01.090
Rick Grimes of Alexandria...

19:01.265 --> 19:04.723
you have given the King
much to ponder.

19:04.893 --> 19:08.101
Well, when l was a kid,

19:08.272 --> 19:12.231
uh, my mother told me
a story.

19:12.401 --> 19:17.566
There was
a road to a kingdom,

19:17.739 --> 19:20.731
and there was a rock
in the road.

19:20.909 --> 19:22.774
And people
would just avoid it,

19:22.953 --> 19:26.411
but horses would break
their legs on it and die,

19:26.582 --> 19:28.743
wagon wheels
would come off.

19:28.917 --> 19:33.377
People would lose the goods
they'd be coming to sell.

19:33.547 --> 19:36.254
That's what happened
to a little girl.

19:36.425 --> 19:39.212
The cask of beer
her family brewed fell right off.

19:39.386 --> 19:41.092
It broke.

19:41.263 --> 19:44.130
Dirt soaked it all up,
and it was gone.

19:44.308 --> 19:49.098
That was her family's
last chance.

19:49.271 --> 19:52.058
They were hungry.
They didn't have any money.

19:54.943 --> 19:59.357
She just
sat there and cried, but...

20:01.950 --> 20:06.319
she wondered
why it was still there...

20:06.496 --> 20:08.953
for it
to hurt someone else.

20:11.919 --> 20:14.456
So she dug at that rock
in the road

20:14.630 --> 20:16.837
with her hands
till they bled,

20:17.007 --> 20:19.464
used everything she had
to pull it out.

20:19.635 --> 20:23.093
It took hours.

20:23.263 --> 20:25.128
And then...

20:27.809 --> 20:29.515
when she was gonna
fill it up,

20:29.686 --> 20:33.429
she saw something in it.

20:33.607 --> 20:35.472
It was a bag of gold.

20:35.651 --> 20:36.936
All right.

20:42.324 --> 20:44.656
The king had
put that rock in the road

20:44.826 --> 20:47.363
because he knew the person
who dug it out,

20:47.537 --> 20:48.617
who did something,

20:48.789 --> 20:52.202
they deserved a reward.

20:52.376 --> 20:53.866
They deserved
to have their life

20:54.044 --> 20:58.287
changed for the good
forever.

21:07.891 --> 21:10.724
I invite you all
to sup with us

21:10.894 --> 21:12.054
and stay
till the morrow.

21:12.229 --> 21:15.517
Yeah,
we need to get back home.

21:15.691 --> 21:19.024
I shall deliver my decree
in the morn.

21:20.529 --> 21:22.019
(staff bangs)

21:41.008 --> 21:42.589
(rustling)

21:54.396 --> 21:56.261
Oh. Sorry.

21:57.774 --> 21:58.889
Sorry.

21:59.067 --> 22:00.352
I thought you were
one of the dead.

22:03.697 --> 22:05.437
Why didn't you just
run the other way?

22:05.615 --> 22:08.072
Well, I'm-- I'm training.

22:08.243 --> 22:10.404
I'm pushing myself,

22:10.579 --> 22:12.570
trying to step up.

22:12.748 --> 22:14.534
Put the safety back on.

22:14.708 --> 22:15.868
Oh.

22:16.043 --> 22:17.749
Practicing shooting.

22:20.213 --> 22:21.953
Let me give you
some advice.

22:22.132 --> 22:24.248
It's gonna be dark soon.

22:24.426 --> 22:26.087
Don't wander around
out here on your own.

22:26.261 --> 22:27.467
You'll get yourself killed.

22:28.472 --> 22:30.554
Same goes for you, too,
right?

22:30.724 --> 22:31.930
You're not me.

22:32.100 --> 22:33.476
Go home, Benjamin.

22:33.643 --> 22:36.100
- Well, |-- wha--
- What?

22:36.271 --> 22:39.604
Ezekiel's gonna keep coming out here
to check on you.

22:39.775 --> 22:41.106
He doesn't want to bug you,

22:41.276 --> 22:43.642
but he needs to know
that you're okay.

22:44.780 --> 22:46.941
He told you that?

22:47.115 --> 22:48.230
No.

22:48.408 --> 22:50.273
But I know him.

22:50.452 --> 22:52.067
(scoffs)
Well, tell him--

22:52.245 --> 22:53.451
I can't.

22:53.622 --> 22:56.409
He looks out for the people
that he cares about.

22:57.459 --> 22:58.995
Do you want some food?

22:59.169 --> 23:00.579
A bottle of water?

23:00.754 --> 23:05.293
I carry extra in case
I run into someone who needs it.

23:05.467 --> 23:07.958
Why?

23:08.136 --> 23:10.468
There's not
a lot of us left.

23:10.639 --> 23:12.254
Have to help each other.

23:16.478 --> 23:18.093
Maybe I'll see you again.

23:18.271 --> 23:20.523
Maybe.

23:20.690 --> 23:23.978
Heel-toe,
heel-toe out here.

23:24.152 --> 23:25.437
Bend at your knees.

23:25.612 --> 23:26.977
You want to keep quiet.

23:27.155 --> 23:29.146
I heard you
from a mile away.

23:29.324 --> 23:31.235
Okay.

23:36.665 --> 23:38.826
Ezekiel:
And when this happens,

23:39.000 --> 23:42.492
and when we allow
freedom to ring...

23:42.671 --> 23:45.333
when we let it ring from
every village and every hamlet,

23:45.507 --> 23:47.793
from every state and every city,

23:47.968 --> 23:49.879
we will be able
to speed up that day

23:50.053 --> 23:51.463
when all of God's children,

23:51.638 --> 23:53.344
black men and white men,

23:53.515 --> 23:56.848
Jews and Gentiles,
Protestants and Catholics,

23:57.018 --> 23:58.519
will be able to join hands

23:58.687 --> 24:01.520
and sing in the words
of the old Negro spiritual--

24:01.690 --> 24:05.979
Free at last, free at last!

24:06.153 --> 24:11.864
Thank God Almighty,
we are... free at last.

24:28.758 --> 24:31.249
Thanks for stepping in
on story duty.

24:33.180 --> 24:36.047
I stopped in
to say good night.

24:36.224 --> 24:38.840
You missed supper.
Where were you?

24:40.270 --> 24:42.727
Went for a walk
in the woods.

24:42.898 --> 24:44.388
- You went out there?
- Mm-hmm.

24:44.566 --> 24:45.772
Unaccompanied?
Yeah.

24:45.942 --> 24:48.058
Took out two dead ones
on my way back.

24:52.240 --> 24:54.617
Wanted to practice
with the gun.

24:56.536 --> 24:58.913
|, uh,
saw Carol out there.

24:59.080 --> 25:01.071
Oh.

25:01.249 --> 25:04.787
Did she, uh... seem well?

25:04.961 --> 25:08.624
- Did-- did you talk to her?
- Yeah.

25:08.798 --> 25:11.255
She asked
why I carry food and water

25:11.426 --> 25:13.257
in case
I run into people.

25:13.428 --> 25:15.214
And you told her?

25:16.932 --> 25:20.015
It's the same reason
we should say yes to Rick.

25:24.105 --> 25:27.063
Elaborate.

25:27.234 --> 25:29.270
You saw their eyes.

25:32.113 --> 25:35.981
They're gonna risk everything
if we help them or not.

25:36.159 --> 25:39.276
And if we don't help them,
if we turn away,

25:39.454 --> 25:42.571
then they can't win.

25:42.749 --> 25:45.616
And if they do, somehow...

25:45.794 --> 25:47.125
they will have saved us,

25:47.295 --> 25:49.547
and we won't
have done a thing.

25:52.300 --> 25:53.460
My dad always said

25:53.635 --> 25:55.125
that if you're asked
to be the hero,

25:55.303 --> 25:56.554
be a hero.

25:59.307 --> 26:02.549
You wanted me to be ready
for anything, and lam.

26:04.646 --> 26:06.011
We are.

26:15.532 --> 26:18.865
I thank you
for your sage counsel.

26:19.035 --> 26:22.323
Your father
would be very proud.

26:22.497 --> 26:25.785
The King
is very proud.

27:06.499 --> 27:08.876
Ezekiel:
This is life here.

27:09.044 --> 27:11.000
Every day.

27:11.171 --> 27:12.752
But it came at a cost.

27:17.260 --> 27:20.673
And I wanted more of this.

27:20.847 --> 27:23.179
I wanted to expand.

27:23.350 --> 27:26.092
To create more places
like this.

27:28.521 --> 27:32.389
Men and women
lost their limbs.

27:32.567 --> 27:34.603
Children
lost their parents

27:34.778 --> 27:36.894
because I sent them into battle
against the wasted

27:37.072 --> 27:38.187
when I did not need to.

27:38.365 --> 27:39.605
This is different.

27:39.783 --> 27:41.614
It isn't.

27:41.785 --> 27:43.901
It is.

27:44.079 --> 27:47.367
The dead don't rule us.

27:47.540 --> 27:49.917
The world doesn't look like this
outside your walls.

27:50.085 --> 27:51.746
People don't have it
as good.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.911
Some people
don't have it good at all.

27:54.089 --> 27:56.000
I have to worry
about my people.

27:58.593 --> 28:01.801
Daryl: You call yourself
a damn king.

28:01.971 --> 28:04.713
You sure as hell
don't act like one.

28:05.809 --> 28:08.391
All of this...

28:08.561 --> 28:10.643
came at a cost.

28:12.399 --> 28:18.144
It was lives, arms, legs.

28:25.412 --> 28:28.495
The peace we have
with the Saviors is uneasy,

28:28.665 --> 28:31.623
but it is peace.

28:31.793 --> 28:34.079
I have to hold on to it.

28:34.254 --> 28:37.291
I have to try.

28:37.465 --> 28:41.424
Although the Kingdom cannot
grant you the aid you desire,

28:41.594 --> 28:44.677
the King is sympathetic
to your plight.

28:44.848 --> 28:49.091
I offer
our friend Daryl asylum

28:49.269 --> 28:51.601
for as long
as he requires it.

28:51.771 --> 28:53.432
He will be safe here.

28:54.816 --> 28:57.603
The Saviors do not set foot
inside our walls.

28:57.777 --> 29:00.439
How long do you think
that's gonna last?

29:39.194 --> 29:40.559
I knew what was coming.

29:40.737 --> 29:43.604
I knew that King guy
would say no.

29:46.826 --> 29:48.817
But it still pissed me off.

29:48.995 --> 29:51.532
What the hell
are you telling me for?

29:51.706 --> 29:54.994
We both had sex
with the same dead guy.

29:55.168 --> 29:56.908
It doesn't
make us friends.

30:00.089 --> 30:02.580
You can change his mind,
but you won't.

30:02.759 --> 30:04.499
Then you can stay.

30:04.677 --> 30:06.633
We can talk.

30:09.557 --> 30:12.674
How many people
do we have?

30:12.852 --> 30:14.717
To fight?

30:14.896 --> 30:15.885
I'll go with you.

30:16.064 --> 30:17.224
We don't even
have enough

30:17.398 --> 30:19.525
to take on one outpost
face-to-face yet.

30:21.611 --> 30:23.351
So the Kingdom
has to get involved,

30:23.530 --> 30:25.612
or the Saviors
will always be in charge.

30:27.534 --> 30:29.900
It isn't about soldiers.

30:30.078 --> 30:32.239
We're making them
stronger.

30:32.413 --> 30:33.573
The more food we give them,

30:33.748 --> 30:35.409
the more arms,
the more everything,

30:35.583 --> 30:38.916
every day any of us
give them something,

30:39.087 --> 30:42.625
they become
harder and harder to beat.

30:42.799 --> 30:44.881
All right, open it up.
We're gone.

30:48.596 --> 30:49.711
Rick: You're not.

30:51.432 --> 30:52.808
I'm not staying here.

30:52.976 --> 30:54.261
You have to.

30:54.435 --> 30:55.811
It's the smartest play.

30:55.979 --> 30:56.968
You know it is.

30:57.146 --> 31:02.061
Try to talk to Ezekiel.

31:02.235 --> 31:03.645
Or stare him
into submission--

31:03.820 --> 31:05.651
whatever it takes.

31:08.992 --> 31:12.405
We'll be back soon.

31:34.809 --> 31:35.844
Negan over radio:
For anyone out there

31:36.019 --> 31:37.975
who loved the obese bastard
as much as I did,

31:38.146 --> 31:40.728
I just want
to say a few words.

31:40.899 --> 31:43.811
Fat Joey was not
the most badass son of a bitch,

31:43.985 --> 31:46.317
but he was loyal.

31:46.487 --> 31:48.273
He had a great sense of humor.

31:48.448 --> 31:51.155
In fact, we were just joking
about oral sex with Lucille

31:51.326 --> 31:52.862
the other day.

31:53.036 --> 31:56.699
Things will not be the same
now that he's dead.

31:56.873 --> 31:58.283
Without Fat Joey,

31:58.458 --> 32:00.244
Skinny Joey is just...

32:00.418 --> 32:02.204
(sighs)
...Joey.

32:02.378 --> 32:04.994
So it's a goddamn tragedy.

32:05.173 --> 32:08.256
So, let's have
a moment of silence.

32:09.677 --> 32:11.633
(brakes squeal)

32:11.804 --> 32:13.544
Someone's trying
to block the way.

32:13.723 --> 32:15.213
Gotta be the Saviors.

32:15.391 --> 32:17.177
Carl: Look.

32:17.352 --> 32:19.013
I think that's their base
over there.

32:20.188 --> 32:21.849
Yeah, that's it.

32:22.023 --> 32:24.184
Must be trying to make it hard
to get to them.

32:24.359 --> 32:26.190
We gotta keep going.

32:26.361 --> 32:29.148
We'll move them,
and then we'll move them back.

32:29.322 --> 32:30.687
They don't need to know
we were here.

32:30.865 --> 32:32.196
(engine shuts off)

32:49.217 --> 32:50.832
Rick.

32:51.886 --> 32:53.717
Come take a look at this.

32:58.393 --> 33:00.384
(car doors closing)

33:12.573 --> 33:14.438
What's all this for?

33:14.617 --> 33:15.948
Carl: Wait.

33:16.119 --> 33:17.404
When I was hiding
in the back of the truck,

33:17.578 --> 33:19.193
I heard a couple of them
talking about this.

33:19.372 --> 33:20.578
This is for a herd.

33:20.748 --> 33:21.737
Rosita: That's why
it's a steel cable.

33:21.916 --> 33:24.248
It's notjust
for one walker.

33:24.419 --> 33:25.534
It's for a lot.

33:30.591 --> 33:32.627
We need
these explosives.

33:32.802 --> 33:34.212
Yeah.

33:34.387 --> 33:36.628
But we have to figure out
how to disarm it first.

33:46.232 --> 33:48.598
Uh...

33:48.776 --> 33:50.027
Okay.

33:52.280 --> 33:54.066
Backing up is not
gonna make a difference

33:54.240 --> 33:55.320
if this thing goes off.

34:00.329 --> 34:03.913
Negan over radio:
We got ourselves a red situation.

34:04.083 --> 34:05.243
I need a search party.

34:05.418 --> 34:06.624
See if Daryl ran home

34:06.794 --> 34:08.625
like the dumb animal
that he is.

34:08.796 --> 34:11.253
Simon over radio:
On it. Be there in time for lunch.

34:11.424 --> 34:13.335
Negan: Turn that
sleepy little burg upside down.

34:13.509 --> 34:14.919
Michonne: We gotta go.

34:15.094 --> 34:16.595
We gotta get there before them,
but we need these.

34:16.763 --> 34:18.799
- We need to clear a path anyway.
- Rick: Yeah.

34:18.973 --> 34:21.555
Rosita?

34:29.609 --> 34:32.351
- First part's done.
- Michonne: What now?

34:32.528 --> 34:33.938
We gotta unwrap
the secondary explosives--

34:34.113 --> 34:35.353
the dynamite, the RPGs.

34:35.531 --> 34:37.032
Make sure these casings
are not messed up,

34:37.200 --> 34:38.690
and do not mess them up,
either.

34:38.868 --> 34:40.153
This thing
could still blow.

34:40.328 --> 34:42.569
Rick: You all heard her.
Let's go.

35:37.051 --> 35:38.587
You can load the explosives
into the trunk

35:38.761 --> 35:40.046
as long as
they're in good shape.

35:40.221 --> 35:41.552
No dents, no tears.
They're not live.

35:41.722 --> 35:43.553
They still need to be triggered
to be set off.

35:46.018 --> 35:49.226
Not that one.

35:49.397 --> 35:51.638
- I don't like the way it looks.
- Tara: Okay.

35:55.069 --> 35:56.184
Carl: Dad.

35:56.362 --> 35:57.943
Look.

36:00.575 --> 36:03.032
Okay.
There they are.

36:05.538 --> 36:06.744
But they're far.

36:06.914 --> 36:08.905
We still have time.

36:09.083 --> 36:10.289
You sure?

36:10.459 --> 36:11.960
We need these.

36:17.925 --> 36:20.632
And we need to get the cars
back in front of the onramp.

36:20.803 --> 36:23.089
They'll know we took
their explosives, so does it matter?

36:23.264 --> 36:25.095
We want that herd
to stay on the highway.

36:25.266 --> 36:27.598
- Why?
- We may need it.

36:27.768 --> 36:30.601
Rosita: Okay.
Tara, Carl, come on!

36:30.771 --> 36:35.390
(music playing)

36:35.568 --> 36:37.399
(engine starts)

36:39.113 --> 36:40.569
(tires squeal)

36:40.740 --> 36:43.732
(music playing)

37:10.770 --> 37:12.510
Uh... Rick...

37:14.357 --> 37:15.346
Rick: All right.

37:15.524 --> 37:16.855
Sasha,Jesus,

37:17.026 --> 37:19.017
can you get back
to the Hilltop on foot?

37:19.195 --> 37:20.275
Yeah.

37:20.446 --> 37:21.811
Tell Maggie
we're not giving up.

37:21.989 --> 37:23.650
Go!

37:23.824 --> 37:24.950
Here.

37:31.832 --> 37:35.199
We need every stick,
every RPG.

37:35.378 --> 37:37.619
Yeah.

37:37.797 --> 37:39.788
Rick.

37:39.966 --> 37:42.332
(walkers growling)

37:42.510 --> 37:46.048
They're gonna cut them off.

37:46.222 --> 37:47.553
Can we just split up?

37:47.723 --> 37:48.803
No.

37:48.975 --> 37:50.010
The cars.

37:50.184 --> 37:52.891
- If they run...
- We lay on the horn

37:53.062 --> 37:54.472
when we start it--

37:54.647 --> 37:56.979
- I'll bring my arm down, and we go.
- Yes.

37:57.149 --> 37:59.185
Stay together!

37:59.360 --> 38:02.318
(walkers growling)

38:04.907 --> 38:08.570
(breathing shallowly)

38:22.883 --> 38:25.215
- Carl: Damn it!
- Rosita: We'll figure it out.

38:25.386 --> 38:26.842
(walkers growling)

38:31.726 --> 38:33.557
(electricity crackles,
engine starts)

38:33.728 --> 38:36.094
(electricity crackles,
engine starts)

38:44.905 --> 38:46.736
(horn honking)

38:46.907 --> 38:49.819
(walkers growling)

39:11.098 --> 39:12.634
(growling continues)

39:20.733 --> 39:22.724
(grunting)

39:38.751 --> 39:40.958
(engine revs, tires squeal)

39:41.128 --> 39:43.665
(walkers growling)

39:46.759 --> 39:48.670
(breathing heavily)

40:06.654 --> 40:09.270
Yeah, I didn't like
the look of that shit at all.

40:10.616 --> 40:12.152
I pushed it.

40:12.326 --> 40:13.315
I pushed it.

40:13.494 --> 40:15.450
(both panting)

40:15.621 --> 40:17.122
(whispering)
We're here.

40:17.289 --> 40:19.496
You can smile.

40:19.667 --> 40:21.874
We made it.

40:22.044 --> 40:24.330
We can make it.

40:24.505 --> 40:26.416
We can.

40:32.847 --> 40:35.008
We're the ones who live.

40:45.860 --> 40:47.191
Tobin:
Lose the car?

40:47.361 --> 40:48.692
Uh, it's somewhere safe.

40:48.863 --> 40:50.819
- You didn't find anything.
- No.

40:50.990 --> 40:53.026
Listen,
we need to get everyone ready.

40:53.200 --> 40:54.360
- (vehicles approaching)
- The--

41:33.908 --> 41:38.322
(vehicle doors open, close)

41:40.206 --> 41:43.243
Simon: Rick. Hello.

41:43.417 --> 41:46.909
And hello again.

41:47.087 --> 41:49.954
We thought
it'd be longer.

41:50.132 --> 41:52.088
Do you think
we're here for a tribute?

41:52.259 --> 41:54.591
Do you?

41:55.930 --> 41:57.966
Is there another reason?

41:58.140 --> 42:00.927
There is.

42:01.101 --> 42:02.887
We're here for Daryl.

42:03.062 --> 42:04.768
Negan took Daryl.

42:04.939 --> 42:08.978
Oh, but...
then your son showed up,

42:09.151 --> 42:10.937
Daryl went missing--

42:11.111 --> 42:13.443
might those two things
be connected?

42:13.614 --> 42:16.447
They're not.

42:16.617 --> 42:18.949
We didn't know he was gone
till right now.

42:20.996 --> 42:23.248
Then this should be easy.

42:23.415 --> 42:25.747
Now,
everyone find a buddy.

42:25.918 --> 42:28.500
Gonna have
to follow us around.

42:29.964 --> 42:31.500
If he's here,

42:31.674 --> 42:35.087
we really need you all
to see him die.

42:54.989 --> 42:57.947
(crashing)

43:13.340 --> 43:16.173
(whistles)

43:16.343 --> 43:17.674
Wow.

43:17.845 --> 43:21.383
These are some
bare shelving units.

43:21.557 --> 43:22.967
You guys have
a barbecue or something

43:23.142 --> 43:25.224
and not invite us?

43:25.394 --> 43:28.511
Seriously,
this is sad.

43:28.689 --> 43:31.351
Hope you're not trying
to hide stuff from us,

43:31.525 --> 43:34.312
'cause that generally
doesn't go over very well.

43:34.486 --> 43:35.987
We have
a lot of people.

43:36.155 --> 43:38.191
It's... getting harder
to find stuff,

43:38.365 --> 43:41.027
and our focus lately
has been on finding things

43:41.201 --> 43:43.533
that Negan might want.

43:43.704 --> 43:45.660
We're still adjusting
to the new system.

43:45.831 --> 43:47.696
We were gonna
scavenge more today.

43:47.875 --> 43:50.207
If you just wait, we'll...
bring something back.

43:50.377 --> 43:51.366
We'll find more.

43:51.545 --> 43:53.706
Aww.
(chuckles)

43:53.881 --> 43:55.246
Relax.

43:55.424 --> 43:56.914
I'm not here
for a pick-up.

43:57.092 --> 43:59.174
Good thing.

43:59.345 --> 44:00.505
But that day is coming,

44:00.679 --> 44:02.590
so you best do
whatever you need to.

44:02.765 --> 44:04.380
Dig deep.

44:04.558 --> 44:06.173
Go the extra mile.

44:06.352 --> 44:08.013
Take some risks!

44:08.187 --> 44:09.472
We will.

44:11.148 --> 44:13.434
Well,
we will appreciate that.

44:19.573 --> 44:22.565
Thank you for the cooperation,
Rick.

44:22.743 --> 44:25.450
My apologies for leaving
the place a bit of a mess,

44:25.621 --> 44:30.866
but we got a litany
of other shit to attend to.

44:31.043 --> 44:34.080
So do you, I guess.

44:34.254 --> 44:36.245
Tick-tock.

44:36.423 --> 44:37.538
Chop-chop.

44:43.430 --> 44:47.264
Oh!
And, Rick...

44:47.434 --> 44:49.265
if Daryl does turn up here

44:49.436 --> 44:53.600
two days from now,
two months from now...

44:53.774 --> 44:55.981
hell, two years from now,

44:56.151 --> 44:58.767
just know there's
no statute of limitations

44:58.946 --> 45:00.186
on this.

45:01.407 --> 45:04.274
Keep that hatchet handy.

45:05.619 --> 45:08.452
if he turns up
with you people.

45:08.622 --> 45:11.364
And it won't turn out
the way it did for your boy.

45:12.501 --> 45:14.082
(engine revs)

45:27.599 --> 45:28.975
What happened
to the pantry?

45:29.143 --> 45:30.303
Aaron: We don't know.

45:30.477 --> 45:32.308
And we need to talk
about Gabriel.

45:32.479 --> 45:33.685
Where is he?

45:33.856 --> 45:35.016
He was on watch

45:35.190 --> 45:37.101
the night
you all went to scavenge.

45:37.276 --> 45:40.313
I was supposed to take over
for him in the morning.

45:40.487 --> 45:41.693
He wasn't at his post.

45:41.864 --> 45:44.480
Pantry was cleared out
and a car was gone.

45:44.658 --> 45:45.864
Eric:
No one's seen him since.

45:46.034 --> 45:48.491
(scoffs)
That son of a bitch.

45:48.662 --> 45:51.654
- He stole our shit and ran.
- Tobin: That's... what it looks like.

45:51.832 --> 45:52.821
Michonne:
Well, I don't want to believe it.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.707
I don't believe it.
That's not Gabriel.

45:55.878 --> 45:57.493
He wouldn't do that to us.

45:57.671 --> 45:58.706
I thought he changed, too,

45:58.881 --> 45:59.996
but it can't be
anything else.

46:00.174 --> 46:02.210
Yes, it can.

46:07.681 --> 46:11.139
Tara: I can't believe he would
just take our stuff and go.

46:11.310 --> 46:13.847
I mean, that's--
that's not who he is.

46:14.021 --> 46:17.684
Well, he saw
Olivia and Spencer die

46:17.858 --> 46:19.644
right in front of him.

46:20.986 --> 46:22.726
I know.
Ijust...

46:24.823 --> 46:26.814
He found his courage,
you know?

46:26.992 --> 46:29.734
I want to believe
he held on to it.

46:29.912 --> 46:32.699
Why wouldn't he have
taken this with him?

46:32.873 --> 46:34.784
Why would he leave it
on the floor?

46:37.377 --> 46:40.210
Aaron: There weren't tracks
out there before.

46:40.380 --> 46:42.211
We didn't
find anything now.

46:42.382 --> 46:44.589
Maybe Daryl
could've picked something up.

46:45.886 --> 46:47.217
He left.

46:47.387 --> 46:49.048
He didn't leave a note.

46:49.223 --> 46:51.088
He obviously
doesn't want to be found.

46:53.852 --> 46:55.763
Rick: Yes, he does.

47:03.237 --> 47:05.444
How would he know
we were out there?

47:08.075 --> 47:09.440
I don't know.

47:14.081 --> 47:16.037
So that's it?

47:16.208 --> 47:17.573
You're finally leaving me?

47:17.751 --> 47:20.037
You caught me.

47:20.212 --> 47:22.794
I'm just...

47:22.965 --> 47:26.048
sick of being so damn happy
at home, you know?

47:26.218 --> 47:29.426
Didn't know
how to tell you.

47:29.596 --> 47:30.881
Babe"

47:31.056 --> 47:32.296
They need me.

47:32.474 --> 47:35.056
Gabriel needs me.

47:36.770 --> 47:39.557
Ifl ask you something,

47:39.731 --> 47:43.269
- will you tell me the truth?
- Of course.

47:43.443 --> 47:47.106
The others didn't go out there
scavenging, did they?

47:47.281 --> 47:49.647
They're going after them again,
and they're not telling us.

47:49.825 --> 47:51.281
Rick has his reasons.

47:51.451 --> 47:54.443
Rick didn't get
the shit beaten out of him.

47:54.621 --> 47:56.907
You think this is about Gabriel,
but it's gonna be more.

47:57.082 --> 47:59.448
It's always more.

47:59.626 --> 48:04.165
So, please,
please don't go.

48:07.426 --> 48:09.633
Gabriel's one of us.

48:11.471 --> 48:12.722
I have to.

48:14.308 --> 48:17.175
What's going on with the Saviors,
that isn't this.

48:17.352 --> 48:19.764
If Rick is taking on the Saviors,

48:19.938 --> 48:21.974
that is everything.

48:22.149 --> 48:24.105
W-what if they find out
while you're gone?

48:24.276 --> 48:25.482
What if they come back here?

48:25.652 --> 48:27.984
Do you want to leave?

48:28.155 --> 48:29.986
Just turn our backs?

48:35.537 --> 48:38.449
I want us alive.

48:39.833 --> 48:41.198
Both of us.

48:48.216 --> 48:51.959
(walkers growling in distance)

49:18.038 --> 49:19.574
Psst.

49:52.739 --> 49:54.115
(whistles)

50:14.094 --> 50:15.550
ﬂhuds)

51:04.603 --> 51:07.811
