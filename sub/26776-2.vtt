11:04.997 --> 11:06.599
- I'm back!

11:06.665 --> 11:08.267
- Did you find Ray and Henry?

11:08.334 --> 11:09.535
- Yah, they're fine!

11:09.602 --> 11:10.870
Ray: No we're not fine!

11:10.936 --> 11:12.438
Henry: We were thrown
through a window!

11:12.505 --> 11:13.773
Ray: I also lost my car keys!

11:13.839 --> 11:15.341
Henry: We are the opposite
of fine!

11:15.408 --> 11:17.977
- They're fine.

11:20.846 --> 11:22.815
- Ewwwww!!!
- Gross!

11:22.882 --> 11:25.418
- You smell like
my sister's barn!

11:25.484 --> 11:26.786
- Well we were dumped
in a sewer!

11:26.852 --> 11:28.487
- By a giant named Barge

11:28.554 --> 11:29.655
who takes orders from a towel!

11:29.722 --> 11:31.090
- And we can't move our bodies!

11:31.157 --> 11:33.926
- 'Cuz Barge sprayed us
with Flabber Gas!

11:33.993 --> 11:35.795
- Flabber Gas?!?
- Yea!

11:35.861 --> 11:39.031
- That's almost
impossible to find.

11:39.098 --> 11:42.134
How could a low-level
towel thief

11:42.201 --> 11:43.803
get some Flabber Gas?

11:43.869 --> 11:45.404
- Who cares?!? Just fix us!

11:45.471 --> 11:46.539
- Yeah, can you fix us Schwoz?

11:46.605 --> 11:47.773
- Yah, of course.

11:47.840 --> 11:49.008
- Yes!
- You are the best, Schwoz.

11:49.075 --> 11:50.976
- If I had that can
of Flabber Gas.

11:51.043 --> 11:53.646
- No!
- You are the worst!

11:53.712 --> 11:54.713
- Charlotte,
please pick up my arm

11:54.780 --> 11:56.715
and use it to smack Schwoz.

11:56.782 --> 11:58.651
- Well I would...

11:58.717 --> 12:00.186
but I need my hand
to scratch my head.

12:00.252 --> 12:02.521
Because I'm confused...

12:02.588 --> 12:04.190
- Oh god, it's her
lecture voice.

12:04.256 --> 12:06.592
- Well if you don't want
to listen to my lecture,

12:06.659 --> 12:08.527
you are free to get up
and walk away.

12:08.594 --> 12:11.097
- Oooooooo, yas queen!

12:11.163 --> 12:15.534
High-five because
we can use our arms!

12:15.601 --> 12:17.536
- Here's what I don't
understand...

12:17.603 --> 12:21.207
I thought you guys
were superheroes...

12:21.273 --> 12:22.541
with super powers...

12:22.608 --> 12:23.943
- Henry, don't listen,

12:24.009 --> 12:25.411
she's using our
words against us!

12:25.478 --> 12:26.979
- Wait, wait, wait, dude she
might be onto something.

12:27.046 --> 12:29.415
- God, it's already working!

12:29.482 --> 12:32.852
- I just think that maybe
if you guys weren't so cocky

12:32.918 --> 12:34.753
that you would've beaten Barge
and wouldn't have ended up

12:34.820 --> 12:37.823
all smelly and flabby
on beanbags.

12:37.890 --> 12:40.826
- You don't know that.

12:40.893 --> 12:43.329
- Dude, you know what,
she's right.

12:43.395 --> 12:44.697
But what are we gonna do now?

12:44.763 --> 12:46.799
Barge is out there
stealing towels

12:46.866 --> 12:48.000
and we can't do
anything about it

12:48.067 --> 12:50.336
because we can't even move!

12:50.402 --> 12:52.638
- CHARLOTTE, CAN YOU COME
HELP ME BEAT THIS GUY?!?

12:52.705 --> 12:53.639
I CAN'T DO IT!

12:53.706 --> 12:56.976
- Flyin' in.

13:00.779 --> 13:04.083
- Dude, before you
come into work tomorrow,

13:04.150 --> 13:06.952
I'm gonna need you
to go down to the sewer

13:07.019 --> 13:09.955
and look for my car keys.
- Dude, dude--

13:10.022 --> 13:11.924
- It's got a Felix
the Cat keychain--

13:11.991 --> 13:14.693
- No, dude, Schwoz
is making his "idea face."

13:14.760 --> 13:16.795
- He is? That's great!
- Yeah.

13:16.862 --> 13:19.131
- Is he making the idea noise?
- Uh...

13:19.198 --> 13:20.566
- [ idea noise ]

13:20.633 --> 13:22.535
- He's making the noise dude!

13:22.601 --> 13:24.203
- I have an idea!

13:24.270 --> 13:25.838
- YEAH SCHWOZ!
- YES SCHWOZ!

13:25.905 --> 13:28.774
- Charlotte, go get
your mooshun capture suit!

13:28.841 --> 13:30.509
- Flyin' out!

13:30.576 --> 13:32.077
- So what's your idea, dude?
- Where are you going?

13:32.144 --> 13:33.612
- Where are you going
with Schwoz?

13:33.679 --> 13:36.348
- Why are you walking
with purpose?

13:36.415 --> 13:39.051
- Schwoz! Schwoz!
- Schwoz! Schwoz!

13:43.355 --> 13:46.792
- Well I didn't find my
World's Best Dad's Towel towel,

13:46.859 --> 13:48.494
but I did find this bush.

13:48.561 --> 13:51.397
Which isn't drying me at all!

13:53.566 --> 13:57.403
Wait, what are all you damp
people doing in my kitchen?

13:57.469 --> 13:58.871
- We're here to buy towels.

13:58.938 --> 14:01.207
That girl said
she had towels to sell,

14:01.273 --> 14:02.808
but I don't see
any towels anywhere.

14:02.875 --> 14:05.544
[ murmuring ]

14:05.611 --> 14:07.846
- Listen!

14:07.913 --> 14:09.915
I understand your frustration

14:09.982 --> 14:11.617
and I want you to
know that your murmurs

14:11.684 --> 14:13.419
are very important to us.

14:16.622 --> 14:20.092
- Hey, there's my towel!

14:20.159 --> 14:21.594
- I'll give you a hundred
dollars for it!

14:21.660 --> 14:23.596
- No. This is my towel.

14:23.662 --> 14:25.331
It says World's Best Dad's Towel

14:25.397 --> 14:27.466
and I bought it for myself
as a Father's Day gift.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.568
- Do I hear 200?

14:29.635 --> 14:31.136
- I'll give ya 200.

14:31.203 --> 14:32.404
- 250!

14:32.471 --> 14:34.540
- 275!
- 271!

14:34.607 --> 14:36.075
- 273!
- 270!

14:38.911 --> 14:40.346
- How are we doing, Schwoz?

14:40.412 --> 14:41.747
- Yeah. Are we paired, yet?
Why can't we move?

14:41.814 --> 14:43.082
- What is taking so long?

14:43.148 --> 14:44.416
- It was more difficult
than I thought

14:44.483 --> 14:46.919
to modify my Battlesuits
to receive a signal

14:46.986 --> 14:48.754
from the suits Jasper
and Charlotte are wearing.

14:48.821 --> 14:51.423
- How'd you even do that?

14:51.490 --> 14:53.058
- I could explain it to you,

14:53.125 --> 14:55.861
but Charlotte is the only one
smart enough to understand.

14:55.928 --> 14:58.564
- Hey! You think
Charlotte's sooo smart?

14:58.631 --> 15:00.366
- Yah.

15:00.432 --> 15:02.334
- Yeah, you're right.

15:02.401 --> 15:04.036
- If this works

15:04.103 --> 15:06.705
then you two can control
Captain Man and Kid Danger

15:06.772 --> 15:08.707
just like you controlled
the Bear and Hair

15:08.774 --> 15:09.775
in the video game.

15:09.842 --> 15:11.210
- Yeah yeah yeah.

15:11.277 --> 15:12.745
And then they can send us
to go find Barge

15:12.811 --> 15:14.947
and make him
throw in the towel.

15:15.014 --> 15:16.148
- Oooo. That's good.

15:16.215 --> 15:17.783
Remember that when we get there.

15:18.851 --> 15:21.487
- Ooh. Something's happening.

15:21.553 --> 15:25.291
- Whoah. Oh!

15:25.357 --> 15:27.626
- This is so cool!

15:27.693 --> 15:29.228
- We're one and the same!

15:29.295 --> 15:30.996
- Let's not get carried away.

15:31.063 --> 15:32.631
- Is this a bad time
to say I have to pee?

15:32.698 --> 15:34.033
- It's a very bad time.

15:34.099 --> 15:36.702
- Then I will not say it.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.737
- Watch this.

15:38.804 --> 15:42.141
- What?!
- This is crazy!

15:43.809 --> 15:46.245
- Wait. These Battle Suits
make you super strong right?

15:46.312 --> 15:48.781
- Yeah!

15:48.847 --> 15:52.584
- What are you doing?

15:52.651 --> 15:55.321
- Whoah!
- That was awesome!

15:55.387 --> 15:57.022
- Eeeeeee!

15:57.089 --> 16:00.092
- Look at me! I'm a superhero!

16:00.159 --> 16:03.595
Taste my fists
and smell my kicks!

16:03.662 --> 16:05.164
- You're not a superhero!

16:05.230 --> 16:07.866
- Raise your hand if you think
Jasper is a superhero.

16:10.336 --> 16:12.304
- Jasper, please
put my hand down!

16:12.371 --> 16:14.340
- Okay...

16:16.542 --> 16:17.876
- Dangit!

16:21.313 --> 16:23.916
- Ray and Henry should be
approaching the laundromat now.

16:23.982 --> 16:25.951
- Yeah, we can see everything

16:26.018 --> 16:27.219
through the cameras
in their masks.

16:27.286 --> 16:31.023
- I'm a superhero! Kablam!

16:31.090 --> 16:33.325
- Schwoz,
I would like to trade.

16:33.392 --> 16:36.829
I do not want Jasper
controlling me anymore.

16:36.895 --> 16:40.532
- Charlotte, walk me over
to see if Barge is inside.

16:40.599 --> 16:42.067
- Okay.

16:44.002 --> 16:45.371
- And I smashed everything...

16:45.437 --> 16:47.039
but I still couldn't
find anymore towels.

16:47.106 --> 16:49.575
- I can see him!
Wow, he's...

16:49.641 --> 16:51.677
he's really talking
to a towel, isn't he?

16:51.744 --> 16:54.012
- Yes, your dryness.

16:54.079 --> 16:56.148
- Ray, check it out.
Barge is inside

16:56.215 --> 16:58.283
and he's talking to--

16:58.350 --> 17:00.753
- Wooo!

17:00.819 --> 17:02.654
- I hate my life.

17:02.721 --> 17:03.722
- Jasper, quit it.

17:03.789 --> 17:05.324
- Oooh! Is it time for fighting?

17:05.391 --> 17:08.460
- Yes. Now...

17:08.527 --> 17:10.929
last time,
we didn't have a plan.

17:10.996 --> 17:12.998
- That's right,
Kid, we didn't.

17:13.065 --> 17:14.233
But this time,
we do have a plan.

17:14.299 --> 17:17.836
- JASPERRRRRR
DUNLOPPPPP!

17:17.903 --> 17:19.371
- This is not the plannnn!!!!

17:24.742 --> 17:27.079
- Sorry to barge in.

17:27.146 --> 17:28.947
- I thought I
Flabber Gassed you.

17:29.014 --> 17:30.749
How are you two moving?

17:30.816 --> 17:33.185
- You don't need to worry
about that, De'Bargery.

17:33.252 --> 17:36.522
- Yeah. But what you do
need to worry about is...

17:36.588 --> 17:38.157
our fists!

17:43.128 --> 17:44.329
- Yeah...

17:44.396 --> 17:46.532
You're gonna need
all those towels

17:46.598 --> 17:48.667
to wipe this punch
off your face.

17:48.734 --> 17:51.970
- Hhhhnnn! Gah...

17:53.105 --> 17:54.640
- To anyone who's listening--

17:54.706 --> 17:55.841
this would be the part

17:55.908 --> 17:57.976
where we would normally
start fighting!

17:58.043 --> 17:59.378
- Oh sorry!
- On it!

18:00.646 --> 18:02.915
- No, no, no.
You're in the door.

18:02.981 --> 18:05.017
Turn me around.

18:05.083 --> 18:06.618
- I-I'm trying!

18:06.685 --> 18:08.387
- Yes that's it now kick.

18:08.454 --> 18:11.190
He's in front of you,
now kick him!

18:12.891 --> 18:15.260
You are on the floor get up.

18:15.327 --> 18:16.829
- Stop yelling at me!!

18:16.895 --> 18:18.030
- Yea yea. He's to your right.

18:18.096 --> 18:19.598
- Now where did they go?

18:19.665 --> 18:23.502
Charotte, can you take
control for me?

18:23.569 --> 18:24.970
- Your other right!

18:27.739 --> 18:29.274
- Captain Man I need your help!

18:30.576 --> 18:34.646
- Why? Are we punching
a washing machine?!?

18:34.713 --> 18:38.984
- Sometimes in video games
there's coins inside!

18:39.051 --> 18:41.687
- This is not a video--

18:41.753 --> 18:43.355
Oh wow, look at that.

18:49.761 --> 18:51.163
- You think you got me?

18:51.230 --> 18:52.965
- Well gas again!

18:53.031 --> 18:54.666
- Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh--

18:54.733 --> 18:57.603
Nope.

18:57.669 --> 19:00.305
- Finish him!!!

19:00.372 --> 19:02.407
- Jasper, what did you do?!?
- Sorry!

19:05.110 --> 19:06.545
- Uh, a little help here.

19:06.612 --> 19:09.414
- I'm doing stuff.
It's just not working!

19:09.481 --> 19:11.149
- Captain Man, I need help!

19:11.216 --> 19:12.784
- What should I do?

19:12.851 --> 19:15.754
- Grab the can of Flabber Gas
and spray Barge in the face.

19:27.466 --> 19:30.903
- Good good. Yes yes.
Pick it up.

19:30.969 --> 19:32.137
Just pick up the can!

19:32.204 --> 19:33.138
- I'm trying!

19:33.205 --> 19:34.606
- Jasper what is wrong with you?

19:34.673 --> 19:36.208
- I'm starting
to black out over here!

19:36.275 --> 19:38.110
- It's right there! Pick it up!

19:38.176 --> 19:41.280
- Stop yelling at me!

19:41.346 --> 19:44.249
- Boy, if you can
just pick up this can

19:44.316 --> 19:47.219
and spray Barge,
you will be a superhero.

19:57.563 --> 19:59.464
- I got it!

19:59.531 --> 20:02.100
- Great. Now get over there
and spray Barge in the face.

20:04.836 --> 20:06.271
- Eat this.

20:06.338 --> 20:08.373
- Gah! Dangit!

20:08.440 --> 20:11.677
- Sorry!

20:11.743 --> 20:14.379
- Nooooooooooo!!!

20:19.051 --> 20:21.486
- Good job buddy.

20:21.553 --> 20:23.188
- Victory dance!

20:23.255 --> 20:26.258
- No no no!

20:26.325 --> 20:28.794
- I'm a superhero!

20:34.600 --> 20:37.202
- $4,000.
- $4,000.

20:37.269 --> 20:38.403
Do we hear five? $5,000.

20:38.470 --> 20:40.038
$5,000 to the man
right there.

20:40.105 --> 20:42.674
Do I hear six? Anybody wanna
pay $6,000 for this towel?

20:42.741 --> 20:43.775
- $6,000!

20:43.842 --> 20:45.344
- $6,000 to my dad

20:45.410 --> 20:47.112
who is buying his own towel
that's pretty weird.

20:47.179 --> 20:48.146
Do I hear seven?
Who will give me seven?

20:48.213 --> 20:49.281
- $7,000!

20:49.348 --> 20:51.249
- Ah geez, dad.

20:51.316 --> 20:54.753
- Oh man, it feels good
to have my body back.

20:54.820 --> 20:56.254
- I'm a superhero!

20:56.321 --> 20:57.956
- Jasper, you gotta
stop saying that.

20:58.023 --> 21:01.159
- No I don't--
I'm a superhero!

21:01.226 --> 21:03.328
- $10,000!

21:03.395 --> 21:05.631
- Hey! We got towels!
Who needs towels?

21:05.697 --> 21:07.366
- Wait, what!?!

21:07.432 --> 21:09.267
- Towel shortage is over people!

21:09.334 --> 21:11.036
Thanks to a superhero.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.538
- Noo! Don't take these towels,
you do not need them!!

21:15.340 --> 21:17.409
I will reduce the charge!!
I-I promise!!

21:17.476 --> 21:20.312
No, I--

21:20.379 --> 21:23.248
I almost had $10,000.

21:23.315 --> 21:26.718
- Here. Dry your tears.

21:40.832 --> 21:42.901
- Well hello there.

21:42.968 --> 21:44.603
Look at your jaunty crown.

21:44.670 --> 21:49.274
I think I'll call you...
The King of Towels.

21:49.341 --> 21:52.477
At your service, m'lord.
