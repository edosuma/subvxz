The Summer I Turned Pretty...

00:08.759 --> 00:10.386
Today's open house
has been cancelled.

00:10.469 --> 00:12.138
So I need you all
out of the house.

00:12.221 --> 00:14.306
- The boardwalk.
That's a great idea.
- You should come with us, Skye.

00:14.390 --> 00:16.015
You know, once they get to see
more of Cousins,

00:16.100 --> 00:17.309
and hang out with you guys,

00:17.393 --> 00:19.603
they'll see why we love
this place so much.

00:19.687 --> 00:21.981
- You sure Milo's cool
with you coming with me?
- Why wouldn't he be?

00:22.064 --> 00:23.774
Because we kissed
for, like, two seconds?

00:23.858 --> 00:25.860
Don't worry. I'm right here
with you, okay?

00:28.612 --> 00:29.739
- [screaming]
- You know, I just feel

00:29.822 --> 00:30.990
everyone's slipping away,

00:31.073 --> 00:32.323
and-and the house

00:32.408 --> 00:34.660
is the last thing
tying us together.

What the fuck, Julia?

02:01.247 --> 02:02.373
[Julia] I'm sorry.

02:02.456 --> 02:03.666
This must be such a shock.

02:03.749 --> 02:05.835
I-I spoke to your father
this afternoon,

02:05.918 --> 02:07.711
and-and he and I decided
that it would be best

02:07.795 --> 02:09.672
not to drag this out
any longer than necessary.

02:09.755 --> 02:12.091
I don't give a shit
what the two of you decided on.

02:12.174 --> 02:14.677
You had no right to touch
anything in this house.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.720
- Those were her things.
- Breathe, man. Okay?

02:16.804 --> 02:18.597
- [Conrad] Stop.
- [Julia] Everything's
in storage.

02:18.681 --> 02:19.765
I made sure that everyone

02:19.849 --> 02:22.977
was very careful
with every single thing.

02:23.060 --> 02:24.562
I'm just doing what I have to do

02:24.645 --> 02:25.688
- to sell this house.
- [Conrad] Bullshit.

02:25.771 --> 02:26.814
You could have said something.

02:26.897 --> 02:28.524
You could have warned us.

02:28.607 --> 02:30.609
All you want to do
is fight our mom,

02:30.693 --> 02:32.111
- constantly.
- Okay, enough.

02:33.112 --> 02:34.780
You're not the only one
that's hurting here.

02:36.323 --> 02:38.659
And I'm not the one
you should be angry with.

02:38.742 --> 02:40.119
Your mother
could have warned you

02:40.202 --> 02:41.745
that this was gonna happen.

02:43.414 --> 02:47.293
She just wanted to make me
the bad guy, as usual.

02:47.376 --> 02:51.088
I'm so sorry
that she was too busy dying

02:51.171 --> 02:52.673
to make your life
a little easier.

02:52.715 --> 02:54.675
You know, it sucks
that our grandfather

02:54.758 --> 02:56.051
loved her more than you,

02:56.135 --> 02:57.720
but I'm not surprised.

03:03.642 --> 03:06.312
[Jeremiah] Conrad could have
chosen his words better.

03:06.395 --> 03:07.980
But he's not wrong.

03:08.063 --> 03:10.190
The truth hurts.

03:10.274 --> 03:11.775
All of it hurts.

03:17.031 --> 03:18.657
[Belly] Jere...
[exhales]

03:24.329 --> 03:26.457
What did you say to them,
anyway?

03:26.540 --> 03:27.875
I told them about Shitmas.

03:27.958 --> 03:30.085
I mean, I just wanted
them to understand

03:30.169 --> 03:31.086
why you're selling the house.

03:31.170 --> 03:32.129
You shouldn't have done that.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.422
That was private.

03:33.505 --> 03:34.465
Listen, I'm not going to defend

03:34.548 --> 03:35.633
what Conrad just said, okay?

03:35.716 --> 03:37.509
That wasn't right.

03:37.593 --> 03:40.930
B... I-I can't defend
this either, Mom.

03:41.013 --> 03:42.222
I mean, can you?

03:43.807 --> 03:45.684
[sighs]

03:47.561 --> 03:48.728
Uh...

03:48.812 --> 03:50.940
[Steven] Connie,
come on... No.

03:51.023 --> 03:52.983
Connie.

03:54.026 --> 03:55.110
[line ringing]

03:55.194 --> 03:57.655
Of course,
Dad did nothing to stop her.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.198
Connie, what can he do?

03:59.281 --> 04:01.992
Jere! He doesn't care about us!

04:02.076 --> 04:03.869
[Jeremiah] Our dad
was never going to win

04:03.953 --> 04:05.955
a Father of the Year award.

04:06.038 --> 04:08.415
He was flawed, that's for sure.

04:08.499 --> 04:11.043
But when it counted,
he was there at the end.

04:11.126 --> 04:12.878
Conrad just couldn't see it.

04:12.962 --> 04:14.463
He didn't want to.

04:14.546 --> 04:17.507
And this asshole won't even
pick up my... calls.

04:18.509 --> 04:19.635
- Did you know about this?
- Easy, Connie.

04:19.718 --> 04:21.053
I'm, no, I'm serious.
I'm serious.

04:21.136 --> 04:22.346
- Did you know about this?
- [Skye] I-I didn't know

04:22.429 --> 04:24.264
anything, okay?
I swear I would have told you.

04:24.348 --> 04:26.141
[Conrad] Would you have?
Really?

04:26.225 --> 04:28.060
Because we haven't seen
each other in ten years.

04:28.143 --> 04:29.937
Would a day at the boardwalk
have been enough

04:30.020 --> 04:31.438
- to make you betray your mom?
- Listen,

04:31.522 --> 04:32.773
I know we don't know
each other very well,

04:32.856 --> 04:34.942
but I-I wouldn't have
sideswiped you like this.

04:35.025 --> 04:37.152
Connie, come on.

04:37.236 --> 04:38.153
What are we going to do?

04:38.237 --> 04:39.780
I don't know.

04:39.863 --> 04:42.074
[Jeremiah] My whole life,
I've looked up to Conrad.

04:42.157 --> 04:45.869
He's always been smarter,
faster, just... better.

04:45.953 --> 04:49.415
Maybe part of me even needed
that: someone to look up to.

04:49.498 --> 04:50.957
But a lot's happened this year.

04:51.041 --> 04:52.876
I don't feel that way anymore.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.294
Okay, we can't just leave.

04:54.378 --> 04:55.879
All right?
The house isn't sold yet.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.923
- We still have a chance.
- [Skye] A slim one.

04:58.007 --> 05:00.634
I mean, full disclosure,
Mom's realtor is expecting

05:00.718 --> 05:02.886
multiple cash offers,
all over asking,

05:02.970 --> 05:04.430
no contingencies.

05:04.513 --> 05:07.224
Thank you, Skye, for that
bleak as fuck assessment.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.642
Also, where are we going
to sleep tonight?

05:08.726 --> 05:10.686
I think there are some
sleeping bags in the garage.

05:10.769 --> 05:12.229
I'm not sleeping this house.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.398
Okay, I...
We don't have to. All right?

05:14.481 --> 05:16.567
Okay, well, hotels are
usually all booked up

05:16.650 --> 05:18.193
around this time of year.

05:19.903 --> 05:22.156
I feel like I should... go.

05:22.239 --> 05:24.199
And I'd totally invite you guys
to come stay with me,

05:24.283 --> 05:27.202
but it's
a pretty small place, so...

05:27.286 --> 05:29.371
Yeah, maybe...
maybe we should go, too.

05:31.206 --> 05:32.875
[Jeremiah] They're this close
to giving up.

05:32.957 --> 05:34.752
Don't go yet.

06:47.991 --> 06:49.243
wouldn't she get

06:49.326 --> 06:50.409
if, like,
someone checked the logs?

06:50.494 --> 06:52.287
No, no. She works
the randomest hours,

06:52.371 --> 06:54.039
so that alone shouldn't raise
any red flags.

06:54.123 --> 06:56.750
So long as we don't
make a mess, like, at all,

06:56.834 --> 06:58.085
should be good.

06:58.168 --> 07:00.045

even know we're here.

- Thanks.
- Thank you, Cam.

07:06.885 --> 07:07.928
- Thank you, Cam.
- Thanks.

07:08.011 --> 07:09.012
[Jeremiah] Hello?

07:14.393 --> 07:15.644
So what do we do now?

07:15.727 --> 07:17.604
Ugh. Could we
scavenge for food?

07:17.688 --> 07:19.565
I need something in my system
other than sugar.

07:19.648 --> 07:21.400
Allow me to escort you
to the kitchen.

07:21.483 --> 07:22.651
Actually, wait.
Can I come with you?

07:22.734 --> 07:24.486
I have really
specific snack requirements.

07:24.570 --> 07:25.737
[Steven] Uh-uh, Taylor.
No, you're coming with me.

07:25.821 --> 07:27.698
We'll fashion, like,

07:27.781 --> 07:29.908
- curtains and some shit.
- [Taylor] No, I'm on
snack patrol right now.

07:29.992 --> 07:31.368
Okay. So?
I need your loudest voice

07:31.451 --> 07:32.578
to scare away all the murderers.

07:32.661 --> 07:34.454
- Yeah, I'm Team Murderers.

Okay, fine. No, I mean,

dusty polyester sheets.

Why do you need help with this?

- [Taylor] What do
you need me for?

07:47.718 --> 07:49.720
All right, I think
I know a place we could sleep.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.054
Uh, you want to come?

07:51.138 --> 07:53.307
Think I'm gonna go
with Cam and Skye, actually.

07:53.390 --> 07:55.142
[Belly] I'll catch up
with you later.

07:59.188 --> 08:00.772
Are you okay?

08:01.773 --> 08:03.567
I never should have gone
to the boardwalk.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.652
[Belly] This is not
your fault, Conrad.

08:05.736 --> 08:08.197
There was no way you could have
known what Julia was planning.

08:08.280 --> 08:11.074
Maybe, but she never would
have done it if I'd stayed back.

08:12.868 --> 08:14.203
They fucking took everything.

08:14.286 --> 08:15.287
And you heard Skye.

08:15.370 --> 08:16.914
The house is going to sell fast.

08:17.915 --> 08:19.416
No.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.793
No, it's not over. I mean...

08:23.295 --> 08:25.339
We're gonna figure
something out.

08:25.422 --> 08:26.924
[Jeremiah] Sometimes
I hate myself

08:27.007 --> 08:28.675
for how long it took me
to notice it.

08:28.759 --> 08:31.011
That invisible force
between the two of them.

08:31.094 --> 08:33.679
I wanted to tell Conrad
that he had no right,

08:33.764 --> 08:35.974
that he'd ignored Belly
for all these years.

08:36.058 --> 08:38.268
But it wasn't just
up to Conrad.

08:38.352 --> 08:40.520
It was Belly's choice, too.

08:40.604 --> 08:42.813
So I forced myself to let it go.

08:42.898 --> 08:46.026
There were more important things
to worry about then, anyway.

08:54.826 --> 08:57.204
What are you doing here?
Don't you have class?

08:57.287 --> 08:59.498
Yeah, class got canceled.

08:59.581 --> 09:02.542
Thought I'd come see
you and Mom.

09:02.626 --> 09:04.753
Did Mom get the full-size
Snickers for Halloween?

09:04.836 --> 09:06.338
[Jeremiah] Mm-hmm.

09:09.841 --> 09:12.803
You think Mom's insurance
is going to accept

09:12.886 --> 09:14.221

- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:05.684 --> 28:06.769
That makes sense.

28:06.852 --> 28:08.729
- [laughter]
- Oh! Comin' for you.

28:08.813 --> 28:11.065
- You are so gonna pay for that.
- Go, go, go!

28:11.148 --> 28:12.900
- [shouting]
- All right, all right.

28:12.983 --> 28:14.193
All right, all right.

28:15.277 --> 28:17.655
- Should've stayed inside.
- Need some help?

28:17.738 --> 28:19.407
This is so annoying.

28:19.490 --> 28:21.575
Weed is not supposed
to be this difficult.

28:21.659 --> 28:22.660
I mean, it's like...

28:22.743 --> 28:24.703
Can I give it a shot?

28:24.787 --> 28:26.372
- Yeah. Have at it.
- Thanks.

28:26.455 --> 28:27.998
[Cam] Be gentle.

28:28.082 --> 28:29.583
[laughs]

28:29.667 --> 28:31.085
- [Cam] Come on.
- [Jeremiah] Oh, you want help?

28:31.168 --> 28:32.545
[Taylor] What?

28:32.628 --> 28:34.588
- What was that look?
- Mm.

28:34.672 --> 28:37.216
You and Steven. It just...

28:37.299 --> 28:38.884
seems like
there's kind of a vibe.

28:38.968 --> 28:40.094
No, there's no vibe.

28:40.177 --> 28:43.722
I save all my...
all my vibing for Milo.

28:45.933 --> 28:46.934
Okay.

28:48.644 --> 28:50.604
Steven really hurt me last year.

28:50.688 --> 28:52.356
It's just...
It's not the kind of hurt

28:52.440 --> 28:53.732
that just goes away easily.

28:53.816 --> 28:54.817
You know?

28:55.860 --> 28:57.820
- [Belly] Yeah.
- Or, like, ever, maybe.

28:57.903 --> 28:59.405
Yeah, I get it.

29:02.491 --> 29:03.701
I know you do.

29:04.869 --> 29:07.455
I think I... I loved Conrad

29:07.538 --> 29:10.833
longer and truer
than anyone in my whole life.

29:10.916 --> 29:14.795
And I'll probably never
love anyone like that again.

29:17.298 --> 29:19.216
To be honest,
it's kind of a relief.

29:19.300 --> 29:22.386
'Cause I don't know, I don't
know if I could survive that.

29:22.470 --> 29:24.972
[Taylor and Belly laughing]

29:25.055 --> 29:26.390
[Taylor] Can we make a pact?

29:27.391 --> 29:30.227
Can we just leave
first love in the past?

29:30.311 --> 29:32.062
Like, where it belongs?

29:32.146 --> 29:34.982
Yeah. Yes. Yes.

29:35.065 --> 29:37.234
[both laugh]

29:37.318 --> 29:40.571
I saw you and Jeremy
on the boardwalk.

29:40.654 --> 29:42.656
And tonight on the couch.

29:43.908 --> 29:44.992
There's something there.

29:45.075 --> 29:46.869
Doesn't matter
how far apart you sit, you know?

29:46.952 --> 29:47.953
It's there.

29:49.246 --> 29:51.373
Yeah, I feel like there...

29:51.457 --> 29:52.708
there could be something,
you know?

29:52.791 --> 29:54.835
- Mm-hmm.
- Like this charge

29:54.919 --> 29:57.046
building between us.

29:57.129 --> 29:59.798
But, you know,
then he reminds me

29:59.882 --> 30:02.092
how much I hurt him before.

30:02.176 --> 30:03.928
I don't know. I'm like...

30:04.011 --> 30:06.680
I shouldn't even be thinking
about him like that.

30:09.266 --> 30:11.477
[Skye] Mm-hmm.
Almost got it.

30:13.020 --> 30:15.231
[boys grunting, laughing]

30:15.272 --> 30:16.607
Push, push!

30:16.690 --> 30:18.817
- Put your back into it!
- Oh, God!

30:18.901 --> 30:22.988
All right. All right,
this thing is officially dead.

30:23.072 --> 30:25.074
Why don't we crash up there
for the night?

30:25.157 --> 30:27.076
Well, that would be
perfect timing,

30:27.159 --> 30:30.329
because I have discovered
the secret of the apple bong.

30:30.412 --> 30:31.747
Good job, Skye.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.249
You know, that's surprising.

30:33.332 --> 30:35.501
I have layers.

30:37.461 --> 30:39.213
Great.

30:39.296 --> 30:40.506

30:40.548 --> 30:43.217
[indistinct chatter]

30:43.300 --> 30:47.137
Taylor, volleyball camp
is in four days.

30:50.140 --> 30:52.017
It's not like
they're going to drug test us.

30:52.059 --> 30:54.812
Coach would have had to put
that in her email, right?

30:54.895 --> 30:56.313
What email?

30:56.397 --> 30:57.940
The one that we got
yesterday about camp.

30:58.023 --> 30:59.567
Have you talked to Coach yet?

30:59.650 --> 31:01.986
Um...

31:02.069 --> 31:04.280
- No, not yet.
- Belly, wait. Why?

31:04.363 --> 31:05.823
I swear to God,
if you bail on us again...

31:05.906 --> 31:07.658
No, no, no. I'm not bailing.
I want to go.

31:07.741 --> 31:10.661
Okay, well, don't tell me.
Tell Coach that.

31:10.744 --> 31:12.538
Okay.

31:12.621 --> 31:14.540
Okay, yeah.
I'll text her right now.

31:14.623 --> 31:16.542
- Yeah. Great. Here.
- [Belly] All right.

31:22.631 --> 31:25.509
You know, I-I...
I really just don't want to...

31:25.593 --> 31:27.303
I don't want to have
to have a big conversation

31:27.386 --> 31:29.096
with her about last season,

31:29.179 --> 31:32.141
and, I don't know, I feel like

31:32.224 --> 31:33.642
I just want to show up
ready to play

31:33.726 --> 31:35.728
- and prove myself on the court.
- Okay.

31:35.811 --> 31:36.937
I love that.
It's very Killa B.

31:37.021 --> 31:38.147
- [Belly] Right?
- Yeah.

31:38.188 --> 31:40.858
So I don't have
to text her, right?

31:41.859 --> 31:43.444
Give me your phone.

31:44.486 --> 31:45.571
Mm...

31:45.654 --> 31:47.781
[Taylor] This is ridiculous.

31:47.865 --> 31:51.869
"Hey, Coach, I'm planning
to come to camp next weekend.

31:51.952 --> 31:54.246
I already talked
to the rest of the squad

31:54.330 --> 31:56.624
and they are cool
with me coming.

31:58.125 --> 32:00.085
Can't wait to see you
on the court."

32:00.169 --> 32:01.378
[Belly] Yeah,
that's good. Yeah.

32:01.462 --> 32:03.088
What's happening over here? Hmm?

32:03.172 --> 32:04.632

Um...

32:09.136 --> 32:10.888
I dare you
to eat the apple bong.

32:10.929 --> 32:12.222
[chuckles]

32:14.475 --> 32:16.518
- [Taylor] Ew.
- I'm not scared.
I've done worse.

32:16.602 --> 32:17.603
Yeah, we know.

32:17.686 --> 32:18.687
We worked so hard on this.

32:18.771 --> 32:20.397
[Steven] I am so sorry, Skye.

32:20.481 --> 32:22.274
- I'm so sorry.
- [Skye] And now it's...

- [Steven] Oh, my God.

- Gross.
- Goddamn it!

Wait, wait. He knows he's going
to have to clean that up, right?

you just come back here,

Come on, man. Nobody's playing
Truth or Dare right.

or you go home.

in that moment
