WEBVTT

00:00.701 --> 00:03.734
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:03.734 --> 00:06.507
I REALLY DON'T WANT YOU TO GO.
 THIS WILL MAKE US ENOUGH MONEY
TO GET PAUL OUT OF OUR HOUSE.

00:06.507 --> 00:08.539
MIKE TOOK A JOB IN ALASKA.

00:08.539 --> 00:10.281
I'M TRYING TO TREAT YOU
LIKE A LADY.

00:10.281 --> 00:12.413
BREE'S NEW ROMANCE GOT SERIOUS.

00:12.413 --> 00:16.617
SO YOU'RE SAYING
YOU LIKE ME HOW I AM.
 VERY MUCH.

00:16.617 --> 00:19.250
PAUL'S BRIDE PUSHED HIM
TO THE BREAKING POINT.

00:19.250 --> 00:22.093
I WANT YOU GONE
BY THE END OF THE WEEK.

00:22.093 --> 00:24.625
BUT SHE WAS
STRONGLY ENCOURAGED...

00:24.625 --> 00:26.097
BYE, MAMA.

00:26.097 --> 00:28.429
TO SAVE HER MARRIAGE.

00:33.634 --> 00:35.566
(Mary Alice) HUMILIATION--

00:35.566 --> 00:38.809
IT'S SOMETHING
WE ALL TRY TO AVOID...

00:40.311 --> 00:42.813
WHENEVER POSSIBLE.

00:42.813 --> 00:45.076
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,

00:45.076 --> 00:48.079
THERE ARE SOME DAYS
WHEN WE CAN'T HELP BUT FALL...

00:48.079 --> 00:50.081
(thud)

00:50.081 --> 00:52.453
FLAT ON OUR FACE.

00:52.453 --> 00:55.086
OH! UHH!

00:55.086 --> 00:56.387
(chuckles) YOU OKAY?

00:56.387 --> 00:59.230
I'M FINE! (chuckles)
MORTIFIED, BUT... WHEW! FINE.

00:59.230 --> 01:00.791
WHAT HAPPENED?

01:00.791 --> 01:04.165
I DON'T KNOW. I WAS... (sighs)
THINKING ABOUT HOW HOT IT WAS,

01:04.165 --> 01:06.467
AND I DIDN'T PAY ATTENTION
TO WHERE I WAS GOING.

01:06.467 --> 01:08.339
OH. FOR A SECOND THERE,

01:08.339 --> 01:10.341
I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU FELL ON PURPOSE.

01:10.341 --> 01:11.672
ON PURPOSE?

01:11.672 --> 01:13.674
A BROKEN LEG
WOULD BE A GREAT EXCUSE

01:13.674 --> 01:16.407
TO GET OUT OF DINNER
WITH MY PARENTS.

01:16.407 --> 01:18.779
DON'T BE SILLY. I'M LOOKING
FORWARD TO MEETING YOUR PARENTS.

01:18.779 --> 01:20.151
WHEW.

01:20.151 --> 01:22.813
CAN WE SIT FOR A MINUTE?
(panting)

01:22.813 --> 01:26.387
THE HEAT IS REALLY
STARTING TO GET TO ME.

01:26.387 --> 01:28.789
REALLY? IT'S NOT THAT HOT.

01:28.789 --> 01:30.491
ARE YOU KIDDING?

01:30.491 --> 01:32.563
IT FEELS LIKE...
SOMEONE TURNED ON A FURNACE!

01:32.563 --> 01:34.565
(sighs) OHH.

01:34.565 --> 01:37.298
ARE YOU OKAY? HAVE I BEEN
PUSHING YOU TOO HARD?

01:37.298 --> 01:41.432
NO, NO! I'M HAVING
THE TIME OF MY LIFE. (chuckles)

01:41.432 --> 01:45.506
WHEW. I JUST NEED TO REST
FOR A TINY LITTLE...

01:45.506 --> 01:47.508
(thud)

01:50.841 --> 01:53.113
(air hissing)
 (sighs)

01:53.113 --> 01:54.785
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

01:54.785 --> 01:56.887
I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE.

01:56.887 --> 01:59.190
SHE PROBABLY
JUST OVEREXERTED HERSELF.

01:59.190 --> 02:02.423
THIS IS BEYOND EMBARRASSING.
 THERE'S A LEMONADE STAND
OVER THERE.

02:02.423 --> 02:05.426
SHOULD I GET HER
SOMETHING TO DRINK?
 GOOD IDEA.
SHE MIGHT BE DEHYDRATED.

02:05.426 --> 02:08.329
THIS IS RIDICULOUS. I HAD
A BOTTLE OF WATER AN HOUR AGO.

02:08.329 --> 02:10.330
AND I DID NOT
OVEREXERT MYSELF.

02:10.330 --> 02:12.333
I HAPPEN TO BE
IN VERY GOOD SHAPE.

02:12.333 --> 02:14.665
(Velcro rips)
 YOUR HEART RATE
IS A BIT ELEVATED.

02:14.665 --> 02:16.667
WELL, PROBABLY FROM THE STRESS

02:16.667 --> 02:20.171
OF HAVING ALL THESE STRANGERS
GAWK AT ME.

02:20.171 --> 02:22.513
(breathing heavily)

02:22.513 --> 02:23.814
OH, MY LORD.

02:23.814 --> 02:26.677
IT'S HAPPENING AGAIN.
DO YOU SEE THIS?

02:26.677 --> 02:30.451
IT'S LIKE A WAVE OF HEAT JUST...
COURSING THROUGH MY BODY.

02:30.451 --> 02:32.623
OH.

02:32.623 --> 02:34.925
WHAT IS HAPPENING TO ME?
AM I HAVING A STROKE?

02:34.925 --> 02:37.728
HONEY, YOU'RE JUST
HAVING A HOT FLASH.

02:37.728 --> 02:39.790
A WHAT?
 YEAH, IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

02:39.790 --> 02:42.833
WE ALL HAVE TO GO THROUGH
THE CHANGE SOMETIME.

02:42.833 --> 02:44.335
WAIT, ARE YOU SAYING...

02:44.335 --> 02:46.537
YEP.
YOU'VE STARTED MENOPAUSE.

02:46.537 --> 02:49.169
HUMILIATION...

02:49.169 --> 02:51.302
SO DID WE FIGURE OUT
WHAT WAS WRONG?

02:51.302 --> 02:53.774
IT'S SOMETHING
WE ALL TRY TO AVOID.

02:53.774 --> 02:56.547
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
SHE JUST HAD--
 INDIGESTION.

02:56.547 --> 02:58.849
I NEVER SHOULD'VE
LET YOU BUY ME THAT HOT DOG.

02:58.849 --> 03:02.453
ESPECIALLY WOMEN WHO DATE...

03:02.453 --> 03:15.826
YOUNGER MEN.

03:15.826 --> 03:18.599
IT WAS MORNING IN SUBURBIA--

03:18.599 --> 03:23.334
A TIME FOR WOMEN TO ATTEND
TO THEIR HUSBANDS' NEEDS.

03:23.334 --> 03:25.676
AND WHILE TOM SCAVO'S WIFE

03:25.676 --> 03:28.208
WAS SETTING OUT
THE SPORTS SECTION,

03:28.208 --> 03:32.843
AND CARLOS SOLIS' WIFE WAS
REMOVING LINT FROM HIS SUIT...

03:34.615 --> 03:38.289
AND ROY BENDER'S WIFE
WAS CLEANING HIS DENTURES...

03:41.722 --> 03:44.595
PAUL YOUNG'S WIFE WAS RESTING

03:44.595 --> 03:46.597
BECAUSE SHE HAD
ALREADY ATTENDED

03:46.597 --> 03:49.660
TO HER HUSBAND'S NEEDS...

03:49.660 --> 03:52.733
ALL NIGHT LONG.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.965
THANK YOU.

03:54.965 --> 03:57.908
FOR WHAT?

03:57.908 --> 04:00.010
FOR THE MOST AMAZING NIGHT.

04:00.010 --> 04:01.912
SO I DIDN'T DISAPPOINT YOU?

04:01.912 --> 04:03.714
ARE YOU KIDDING?

04:03.714 --> 04:05.516
I'M SO GLAD.

04:05.516 --> 04:07.748
I MUST SAY, FOR A VIRGIN,

04:07.748 --> 04:09.680
YOU WERE CERTAINLY
OPEN-MINDED.

04:14.385 --> 04:16.957
MY WHOLE LIFE, I HEARD
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT SEX.

04:16.957 --> 04:19.690
THEY ALWAYS MADE
SUCH A BIG DEAL ABOUT IT.

04:19.690 --> 04:22.031
AND DON'T GET ME WRONG,

04:22.031 --> 04:25.536
IT WAS VERY INTERESTING.

04:25.536 --> 04:27.568
BUT LYING HERE QUIETLY...

04:29.269 --> 04:31.642
THIS IS MY FAVORITE PART.

04:31.642 --> 04:33.404
IT'S WONDERFUL, ISN'T IT?

04:40.751 --> 04:42.783
SO WOULD YOU LIKE
TO DO IT AGAIN?

04:42.783 --> 04:45.656
I HEAR THAT MEN LIKE SEX
IN THE MORNING.

04:45.656 --> 04:49.620
I MUST SAY, SO FAR,
YOUR RESEARCH IS FLAWLESS.

04:49.620 --> 04:50.791
(chuckles)

04:50.791 --> 04:54.865
(car horn blares)

04:54.865 --> 04:56.026
(sighs)

04:58.869 --> 05:01.332
BETH, I'M GONNA NEED
A RAIN CHECK.

05:01.332 --> 05:04.405
WHY?
 I HAVE BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO.

05:07.478 --> 05:10.040
WHO IS THAT MAN?

05:10.040 --> 05:13.984
DEREK YEAGER,
MY CELLMATE FROM PRISON.

05:18.318 --> 05:21.652
SO HAVE YOU THOUGHT
ABOUT MY OFFER?

05:21.652 --> 05:22.823
I HAVE.

05:22.823 --> 05:25.656
I ACTUALLY THINK STARTING
AN INTERIOR DESIGN BUSINESS

05:25.656 --> 05:28.058
IS... INTERESTING.

05:28.058 --> 05:30.561
INTERESTING?
IT'S--IT'S GENIUS.

05:30.561 --> 05:33.634
YOU KNOW
WHAT AN ARTISTIC EYE I HAVE.

05:33.634 --> 05:34.965
(Paige coos)

05:34.965 --> 05:36.967
OH, MY GOD. OH, ARE YOU DOING
WHAT I THINK YOU'RE DOING?

05:36.967 --> 05:40.511
IF YOU THINK I'M TRYING TO STUFF
MY BOOB IN MY DAUGHTER'S MOUTH,

05:40.511 --> 05:41.642
THEN YES.

05:41.642 --> 05:43.614
UGH. IT'S SO UNNATURAL.

05:43.614 --> 05:44.675
(chuckles)

05:44.675 --> 05:46.076
SO...

05:47.978 --> 05:49.920
WHAT DO YOU SAY? MM.

05:49.920 --> 05:52.853
I WILL WOO THE CLIENTS,
BE THE FACE OF THE COMPANY,

05:52.853 --> 05:55.486
UH, WHILE YOU DO
ALL THE BUSINESS-Y STUFF.

05:55.486 --> 05:57.758
IT WOULD BE NICE
TO BE MY OWN BOSS.

05:57.758 --> 05:58.929
OKAY.

05:58.929 --> 06:01.662
I'M IN. AND IF WE WORK
OUT OF YOUR PLACE,

06:01.662 --> 06:03.694
I CAN BRING THE BABY WITH ME.

06:03.694 --> 06:05.566
OOH, WELL, THAT...
WON'T WORK.

06:05.566 --> 06:08.539
EVERYTHING AT MY PLACE
IS METAL AND SHARP.

06:08.539 --> 06:11.542
NO, IT ISN'T.
 WELL, THEN I'LL HAVE METAL
AND SHARP THINGS BROUGHT IN.

06:11.542 --> 06:13.544
NO BABIES IN MY HOUSE.

06:13.544 --> 06:16.447
WELL, THEN WE'LL
HAVE TO WORK HERE.
 (scoffs) RIGHT.

06:16.447 --> 06:18.449
POTENTIAL CLIENTS
WILL BE SO IMPRESSED

06:18.449 --> 06:21.051
WHEN THEY WALK INTO THIS...
TIPPED-OVER HAMPER.

06:21.051 --> 06:22.713
GET A NANNY.

06:22.713 --> 06:24.555
I'VE BEEN TRYING.

06:24.555 --> 06:27.558
IT'S NOT THAT EASY.
 WELL, THEN I'LL FIND SOMEONE.

06:27.558 --> 06:30.060
MM, THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOME POOR SCHLUB OUT THERE

06:30.060 --> 06:33.764
WHO'S TRUSTWORTHY
AND DESPERATE FOR MONEY.

06:33.764 --> 06:35.766
(cash register beeping)

06:35.766 --> 06:37.428
I DON'T LIKE THIS KIND.

06:37.428 --> 06:39.430
OH, HONEY, IT'S CHEAPER.

06:39.430 --> 06:41.432
BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE A PRIZE.

06:41.432 --> 06:43.634
(sighs)

06:43.634 --> 06:45.636
THE PRIZE THAT COMES
WITH THIS CEREAL

06:45.636 --> 06:47.978
IS WE CAN AFFORD THE MILK.

06:47.978 --> 06:50.811
OKAY, THAT'S $61.48.

06:50.811 --> 06:52.412
EVEN WITH ALL THE COUPONS?

06:52.412 --> 06:54.485
(sighs)

06:54.485 --> 06:55.616
WELL...

06:55.616 --> 06:56.947
(coins clatter)

06:56.947 --> 06:59.149
NOTHING IN THERE.

06:59.149 --> 07:01.452
LET ME SEE IF I CAN
PUT SOMETHING BACK. UH...

07:03.153 --> 07:06.457
MY FABRIC DOESN'T
HAVE TO BE THAT SOFT.

07:06.457 --> 07:08.028
AND HEY.

07:08.028 --> 07:11.031
MEAT IS MURDER, RIGHT?

07:12.863 --> 07:15.005
OKAY, YOU KNOW,
JUST PUT $20 ON THIS

07:15.005 --> 07:17.107
AND I'LL PAY THE REST
IN CASH.

07:17.107 --> 07:20.541
CARE TO DONATE A DOLLAR
TO ST. MATTHEW'S KIDS?

07:20.541 --> 07:21.441
WHAT?

07:21.441 --> 07:23.113
IT'S FOR POOR PEOPLE.

07:23.113 --> 07:25.115
YOU GIVE A DOLLAR,
I RING THE BELL,

07:25.115 --> 07:26.747
(singsongy) EVERYONE KNOWS
YOU DONATED.

07:26.747 --> 07:29.650
HAS THAT PIERCING
AFFECTED YOUR SIGHT?

07:29.650 --> 07:31.552
I'M COUNTING PENNIES HERE.

07:31.552 --> 07:33.584
LADY, WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO ASK EVERYONE.

07:33.584 --> 07:34.825
CALM DOWN.

07:34.825 --> 07:36.226
"CALM DOWN"?

07:36.226 --> 07:39.229
YEAH, I CAN'T AFFORD TO
BUY MY KID THE CEREAL HE LIKES.

07:39.229 --> 07:41.792
HE'S GOTTA EAT
THIS CARDBOARD CRAP.

07:41.792 --> 07:44.194
OOH! NICKEL IN THE SWEAR JAR!

07:44.194 --> 07:47.197
AND THAT USED TO BE
A QUARTER IN THE SWEAR JAR.

07:47.197 --> 07:49.700
WE'VE EVEN HAD TO MARK DOWN
OUR SWEARS.

07:49.700 --> 07:53.504
SO DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT
THE POOR 'CAUSE I AM THE POOR!

07:53.504 --> 07:56.507
WHERE'S MY LITTLE JAR
AT THE CHECKOUT STAND?!

07:56.507 --> 07:58.008
THERE IS NONE!

07:58.008 --> 08:00.010
(bell dings)

08:02.482 --> 08:05.956
DON'T FEEL BAD. SHE SCREAMED
AT OUR DRY CLEANERS, TOO.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.793
YOUR BURNT THE MEAT LOAF
 AGAIN?

08:12.793 --> 08:15.095
IT'S JUST A LITTLE CRISPY.
IT'LL BE FINE.

08:15.095 --> 08:17.097
AND WHAT'S WITH THE CANDLES
AND THE GOOD CHINA?

08:17.097 --> 08:20.070
IS IT OUR ANNIVERSARY?

08:20.070 --> 08:22.603
OW! WHY ARE YOU HITTING ME?

08:22.603 --> 08:24.605
BECAUSE YOU DON'T LISTEN
TO ME.

08:24.605 --> 08:27.507
I TOLD YOU LAST NIGHT
BOB WAS COMING FOR DINNER.

08:27.507 --> 08:28.539
OH, RIGHT.

08:28.539 --> 08:31.111
(sighs) BOB.

08:31.111 --> 08:33.082
WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

08:33.082 --> 08:35.085
NOT KNOWING
WHEN OUR ANNIVERSARY IS.

08:35.085 --> 08:38.649
OKAY. WHEN IS IT?

08:38.649 --> 08:41.652
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS!
BOB IS GONNA BE HERE ANY SECOND.

08:41.652 --> 08:44.154
DO I HAVE TO EAT
WITH YOU GUYS?

08:44.154 --> 08:47.157
BOB AND I HAVE
NOTHING IN COMMON.
 I'M SORRY HE'S NOT ALL...

08:47.157 --> 08:49.159
(deepens voice)
"SEE THE GAME LAST NIGHT?

08:49.159 --> 08:51.862
CHECK OUT THE JUGS ON HER.
HEY, PULL MY FINGER!"

08:51.862 --> 08:53.864
I DID THAT ONE TIME.

08:53.864 --> 08:56.106
(normal voice)
AT MY COUSIN'S FUNERAL!

08:56.106 --> 08:57.708
YOU'RE RIGHT.

08:57.708 --> 09:01.241
I AM UNFIT TO SOCIALIZE
WITH YOUR CLASSY GAY BOYFRIEND.

09:01.241 --> 09:04.875
I SHOULD BE FORCED TO EAT BY
MYSELF... IN FRONT OF THE GAME.

09:04.875 --> 09:06.276
NO.

09:06.276 --> 09:09.279
YOU ARE HAVING DINNER WITH BOB,
AND THAT IS ALL THERE IS TO IT!

09:09.279 --> 09:11.251
FOR GOD SAKES, HE HELPED US
FIND OUR BIOLOGICAL DAUGHTER.

09:11.251 --> 09:13.253
WE OWE HIM MORE THAN
WE CAN EVER REPAY.

09:13.253 --> 09:16.256
THEN SHOULDN'T WE TAKE HIM OUT
FOR A NICE MEAL INSTEAD

09:16.256 --> 09:19.289
OF FORCING HIM TO EAT THAT
BRIQUETTE YOU CALL MEAT LOAF?

09:20.961 --> 09:23.093
(sighs)

09:34.174 --> 09:37.107
I HOPE THE POT ROAST
ISN'T TOO DRY.

09:37.107 --> 09:39.850
IT'S GOOD.

09:39.850 --> 09:43.353
HE'S AN EX-CON. HE'S JUST HAPPY
THERE'S NO GROUND GLASS IN IT.

09:43.353 --> 09:45.215
(chuckles)

09:48.018 --> 09:51.021
IT MUST BE NICE FOR YOU TWO
TO SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN.

09:51.021 --> 09:53.023
UH, HOW LONG
WERE YOU ROOMMATES?

09:53.023 --> 09:55.896
CELLMATES. YEAGER AND I SPENT
TWO YEARS TOGETHER.

09:55.896 --> 09:58.068
WE KIND OF... LOOKED OUT
FOR EACH OTHER.

09:58.068 --> 09:59.930
THAT'S LOVELY.

10:01.832 --> 10:03.003
(utensil clatters)

10:03.003 --> 10:06.206
IF I MAY ASK, YEAGER,
WHAT WERE YOU, UH...

10:06.206 --> 10:08.979
I BELIEVE THE PHRASE IS
"IN FOR"?

10:11.712 --> 10:14.144
WELL, YOU KNOW, UH,

10:14.144 --> 10:17.317
SOMETIMES WHEN PEOPLE
STEAL STUFF... (swallows)

10:17.317 --> 10:20.751
THEY GIVE IT TO ANOTHER GUY
WHO SELLS IT FOR 'EM.

10:20.751 --> 10:23.093
YES. A "FENCE."

10:23.093 --> 10:24.254
RIGHT.

10:26.096 --> 10:28.358
I KILLED A FENCE.

10:30.060 --> 10:31.331
OH.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.804
WELL, HOW ABOUT THAT?

10:33.804 --> 10:36.266
UH, WE MAY WANNA KEEP
THAT STORY TO OURSELVES.

10:36.266 --> 10:38.138
I'M SURE THE PEOPLE ON THE LANE
WOULD BE UNSETTLED

10:38.138 --> 10:41.071
TO LEARN THAT THEIR NEW NEIGHBOR
WAS A CONVICTED MURDERER.

10:41.071 --> 10:42.843
NEIGHBOR?

10:42.843 --> 10:44.144
YES.

10:44.144 --> 10:47.778
YEAGER'S GOING TO BE STAYING
AT MY OLD HOUSE FOR A WHILE.

10:47.778 --> 10:49.780
HE'S DOING A LITTLE WORK
FOR ME.

10:49.780 --> 10:51.982
WHAT KIND OF WORK?
 IT'S NOTHING YOU NEED
TO WORRY ABOUT.

10:51.982 --> 10:54.284
I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT IT.
I JUST WANNA KNOW.

10:54.284 --> 10:55.726
(utensil clatters)

10:55.726 --> 10:58.288
DARLING, I'M NOT TRYING
TO EXCLUDE YOU.

10:58.288 --> 11:00.360
I'M TRYING TO PROTECT YOU.

11:00.360 --> 11:01.862
FROM WHAT?

11:01.862 --> 11:03.864
BETH, LET'S ENJOY OUR DINNER.

11:03.864 --> 11:05.435
WE HAVE A GUEST.

11:16.747 --> 11:19.079
AH. AND THIS WAS GRACE
AT HALLOWEEN.
 (Bob chuckles)

11:19.079 --> 11:21.081
OH, SHE'S BEAUTIFUL, GABY.
 AND SO SWEET.

11:21.081 --> 11:24.354
(laughs)
 GETTING TO KNOW HER
HAS BEEN SUCH A BLESSING.

11:24.354 --> 11:27.718
CARLOS AND I WILL NEVER BE
ABLE TO THANK YOU ENOUGH.

11:31.121 --> 11:33.123
HEY, I JUST MADE SOME CALLS.

11:33.123 --> 11:36.126
NO, YOU DID MORE THAN THAT.
YOU CHANGED OUR LIVES.

11:36.126 --> 11:38.899
OH. (chuckles)
 SO...

11:38.899 --> 11:40.901
WE WANTED TO GIVE YOU THESE...

11:40.901 --> 11:42.032
OH.

11:42.032 --> 11:44.034
AS A TOKEN
OF OUR APPRECIATION.

11:44.034 --> 11:46.436
ORCHESTRA SEATS TO...
"CATS." (chuckles)

11:46.436 --> 11:49.009
WHAT'S WRONG?
I THOUGHT YOU LOVE MUSICALS.

11:49.009 --> 11:51.441
(scoffs) THAT WAS LEE.
HE WAS THE SHOW QUEEN.

11:51.441 --> 11:53.443
WHEN I FOUND OUT
HE SAW "ANNIE" SIX TIMES,

11:53.443 --> 11:55.846
EVEN I WANTED
TO GAY BASH HIM.

11:55.846 --> 11:58.849
OH. OKAY, WELL, I WANNA
GET YOU TICKETS TO SOMETHING.

11:58.849 --> 12:01.321
DO YOU LIKE THE OPERA?

12:01.321 --> 12:04.094
FIGURE SKATING?

12:04.094 --> 12:06.897
BEAUTY PAGEANTS?

12:06.897 --> 12:08.298
BARBRA?

12:08.298 --> 12:09.960
SORRY.

12:09.960 --> 12:14.734
EVER THINK THE REASON LEE BROKE
UP WITH YOU IS YOU'RE NOT GAY?

12:14.734 --> 12:16.136
HEY, WHAT CAN I SAY?

12:16.136 --> 12:18.138
GIVE ME A BEER
AND A COLLEGE BASKETBALL GAME,

12:18.138 --> 12:19.469
I'M HAPPY.

12:19.469 --> 12:21.471
YOU'RE KIDDING.
WHO YOU LIKE THIS YEAR?

12:21.471 --> 12:24.314
WELL, DUKE'S GOT MOST OF ITS
STARTERS COMING BACK THIS YEAR,

12:24.314 --> 12:26.476
SO...
 HEY, HEY, HEY!
YOU KISS BOYS WITH THAT MOUTH?

12:26.476 --> 12:29.079
BOB, I GET BASKETBALL TICKETS
ALL THE TIME.

12:29.079 --> 12:31.221
YOU WANNA GO TO A GAME
THIS WEEK?

12:31.221 --> 12:33.153
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

12:33.153 --> 12:36.026
OH, I'M IN. YOU KNOW,
THERE'S A GAME ON TONIGHT.
 (mouths word)

12:36.026 --> 12:38.128
MAYBE AFTER DESSERT,
WE CAN TURN ON--
 (stammers)

12:38.128 --> 12:39.389
WHAT'S WRONG?

12:39.389 --> 12:41.391
I THOUGHT I KNEW YOU.

12:41.391 --> 12:44.394
NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU'RE
TALKIN' BEER AND BASKETBALL?

12:44.394 --> 12:47.868
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE NOT EVEN A...
 A TIRED GAY STEREOTYPE?

12:47.868 --> 12:50.040
EXACTLY. IT'S VERY UPSETTING.

12:50.040 --> 12:53.043
TELL YOU WHAT,
LET US WATCH THE GAME.

12:53.043 --> 12:55.245
DURING HALFTIME,
I'LL COME BACK IN AND TELL YOU

12:55.245 --> 12:58.008
HOW GREAT YOU LOOK
IN YOUR DOLCE & GABBANA.
 VERSACE.

13:01.381 --> 13:04.384
JUST GO. I CAN'T EVEN
LOOK AT YOU RIGHT NOW.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.889
MENOPAUSE? YOU'RE NOT OLD ENOUGH
TO BE GOING THROUGH MENOPAUSE.

13:08.889 --> 13:11.992
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY,
 I'M NOT OLD ENOUGH

13:11.992 --> 13:14.224
TO HAVE A FRIEND
 GOING THROUGH MENOPAUSE.

13:14.224 --> 13:16.526
THIS HAS
COMPLETELY BLINDSIDED ME.

13:16.526 --> 13:20.370
THESE LAST FEW WEEKS BEING WITH
KEITH, I HAVE FELT SO ALIVE.

13:20.370 --> 13:22.903
EVEN WHEN I WAS YOUNG,
I DIDN'T FEEL THIS YOUNG.

13:22.903 --> 13:24.905
BUT NOW--
 OH, I HATE TO SPOIL

13:24.905 --> 13:27.477
THE ANNOUNCEMENT
OF YOUR DEATH SENTENCE,

13:27.477 --> 13:30.480
BUT LIFE DOES GO ON.
 AND THERE IS AN UPSIDE.
I'D LOVE TO SKIP

13:30.480 --> 13:33.043
THOSE THREE DAYS A MONTH
WHEN I'M CRANKY AND IRRITABLE.

13:33.043 --> 13:34.344
JUST THREE DAYS, HUH?

13:34.344 --> 13:38.048
(Bree sighs) THIS COULDN'T HAVE
COME AT A WORSE TIME.

13:38.048 --> 13:40.390
I'M SURE IT'LL BE THE END
OF MY RELATIONSHIP WITH KEITH.

13:40.390 --> 13:42.392
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?
 OH, HERE'S WHY--

13:42.392 --> 13:44.094
"CHECK OUT MY GIRLFRIEND,

13:44.094 --> 13:46.096
THE ONE WITH THE PIT STAINS
AND THE ESTROGEN PATCH."

13:46.096 --> 13:47.998
EXACTLY. NOW HE'LL BE LOOKING
FOR SOME FRESH, YOUNG THING

13:47.998 --> 13:50.500
WHO DOESN'T RETAIN WATER
AND CAN STILL BEAR HIM CHILDREN.

13:50.500 --> 13:52.262
SO WHY TELL HIM?

13:52.262 --> 13:54.404
I HAVE TO.
WE'RE IN A RELATIONSHIP.

13:54.404 --> 13:56.937
WHERE'D YOU GET THAT? "THE BIG
BOOK OF STAYING SINGLE"?

13:56.937 --> 13:58.939
THERE IS NO REASON
YOU HAVE TO TELL YOUR BOYFRIEND

13:58.939 --> 14:01.011
THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH
ABOUT YOURSELF.

14:01.011 --> 14:03.874
YEAH, WE LIE TO MEN
ALL THE TIME.
 I DON'T.

14:03.874 --> 14:05.275
OH, PLEASE.

14:05.275 --> 14:07.978
YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU NEVER
PRETENDED YOU LIKE FOOTBALL?

14:07.978 --> 14:10.580
MM, OR LAUGHED
AT A THREE STOOGES MOVIE?

14:10.580 --> 14:14.054
OR FAKED AN ORGASM
JUST TO MAKE HIM STOP?

14:14.054 --> 14:16.226
(clears throat)

14:16.226 --> 14:18.889
HEY, JUST FOR THE RECORD,

14:18.889 --> 14:21.291
I LOVE FOOTBALL,
STOOGES ARE DAMN FUNNY,

14:21.291 --> 14:23.633
AND I'VE NEVER
ASKED A MAN TO STOP.

14:26.236 --> 14:28.568
(sighs)
 (Lynette) INTERESTING.

14:28.568 --> 14:31.571
(beep)

14:31.571 --> 14:34.144
Susan? Renee Perry here.

14:34.144 --> 14:36.146
Uh, listen,
Lynette and I are starting

14:36.146 --> 14:38.949
a fabulous
interior design business.

14:38.949 --> 14:40.180
(chuckles)

14:40.180 --> 14:42.082
Anyway, I hear you've got
some time on your hands,

14:42.082 --> 14:44.084
and we could really use
your help.

14:44.084 --> 14:46.516
The pay's good,
and the hours are flexible.

14:46.516 --> 14:49.019
Now we're at Lynette's
if you're interested.

14:49.019 --> 14:50.290
(beep)
 OH! (gasps)

14:50.290 --> 14:52.622
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

14:52.622 --> 14:56.196
OH! YOUR MOMMY JUST GOT A JOB
AS AN INTERIOR DESIGNER!

14:56.196 --> 14:58.198
(squeals)

14:58.198 --> 15:00.270
(knock on door)
 ...WITH THAT ASH.

15:02.102 --> 15:03.433
SUSAN!

15:03.433 --> 15:05.605
I CAME OVER AS SOON
AS I GOT RENEE'S MESSAGE.

15:05.605 --> 15:09.379
OH, I WOULD LOVE
TO HELP YOU GUYS OUT. (laughs)

15:09.379 --> 15:10.540
(sighs)

15:10.540 --> 15:11.911
BUT--

15:11.911 --> 15:13.944
I TOLD HER ABOUT THE JOB.

15:13.944 --> 15:14.644
RENEE...

15:14.644 --> 15:16.586
OH, WHY NOT?

15:16.586 --> 15:18.518
SHE'S OBVIOUSLY FLAT BROKE.

15:18.518 --> 15:21.591
NO ONE LIVES DOWNWIND
FROM A PET STORE BY CHOICE.

15:21.591 --> 15:24.694
IT'S TRUE. I NEED TO WORK.

15:24.694 --> 15:26.696
WELL, OBVIOUSLY,
YOU'RE MORE THAN QUALIFIED,

15:26.696 --> 15:30.000
BUT ARE YOU SURE IT WON'T
BE WEIRD? I MEAN, WE'RE FRIENDS.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.262
OH, I THINK THAT'S A PLUS.

15:32.262 --> 15:34.464
I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT...

15:34.464 --> 15:36.566
OH, FOR GOD SAKE, THE WOMAN
WANTS TO BE YOUR NANNY.

15:36.566 --> 15:38.108
HIRE HER.

15:38.108 --> 15:40.270
EXCUSE ME
FOR NOT WANTING TO RUIN

15:40.270 --> 15:43.273
ONE OF MY CLOSEST FRIENDSHIPS.
 YOU DIDN'T WORRY

15:43.273 --> 15:45.645
THAT WORKING TOGETHER
WOULD RUIN OUR FRIENDSHIP.

15:45.645 --> 15:47.047
GO FIGURE.

15:47.047 --> 15:48.348
(Paige coos)

15:48.348 --> 15:50.350
WELL, IF YOU'RE COOL WITH THIS,

15:50.350 --> 15:53.353
I WOULD LOVE YOU TO START
RIGHT AWAY. WHAT DO YOU THINK?

15:53.353 --> 15:56.056
I-I THINK MY DEAR FRIEND

15:56.056 --> 15:58.228
JUST OFFERED ME A JOB.
(laughs)

15:58.228 --> 16:00.460
HOW COULD I SAY NO?

16:02.362 --> 16:05.465
(door opens)

16:05.465 --> 16:07.667
MRS. VAN DE KAMP?

16:07.667 --> 16:09.569
HI. I'M DR WAGNER.

16:09.569 --> 16:11.971
OH. UM, I USUALLY SEE
DR. SHAPIRO.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.444
SHE'S ON MATERNITY LEAVE.

16:14.444 --> 16:16.506
OH. WELL, THERE'S SOME SALT
IN THE WOUND.

16:16.506 --> 16:20.580
YES, SO I SEE YOU'RE HERE
TO TALK ABOUT MENOPAUSE.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.752
AND FRANKLY, YOU'RE IN LUCK.

16:22.752 --> 16:26.386
IN ADDITION TO BEING
A GYNECOLOGIST FOR 20 YEARS,

16:26.386 --> 16:28.358
I AM GOING THROUGH THE CHANGE
MYSELF.

16:28.358 --> 16:30.020
IS IT AWFUL?

16:30.020 --> 16:33.763
THE WAY I LOOK AT IT,
WE'VE EARNED THIS.

16:33.763 --> 16:37.527
IT'S LIKE GETTING A WATCH WHEN
YOU RETIRE FROM A JOB WELL DONE.

16:37.527 --> 16:39.399
I SUPPOSE, BUT STILL,

16:39.399 --> 16:42.532
I WAS HOPING YOU COULD GIVE ME
SOMETHING TO MASK THE SYMPTOMS.

16:42.532 --> 16:44.634
SEE, I'M RECENTLY DIVORCED,

16:44.634 --> 16:47.677
AND I'M DATING SOMEONE WHO IS
SIGNIFICANTLY YOUNGER THAN ME.

16:47.677 --> 16:49.209
I UNDERSTAND.

16:49.209 --> 16:51.381
AND MIGHT I ADD,
CHECK YOU OUT!

16:51.381 --> 16:53.283
OH! (laughs)
 (laughs)

16:53.283 --> 16:54.584
WELL, I MUST SAY,

16:54.584 --> 16:57.287
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND
THE YOUNGER MAN EXPERIENCE.

16:57.287 --> 16:59.719
THE STAMINA
CAN BE QUITE INVIGORATING.

16:59.719 --> 17:02.252
I'VE HEARD TELL.

17:02.252 --> 17:05.255
AND IN THE INTEREST OF KEEPING
THIS GOING AS LONG AS POSSIBLE,

17:05.255 --> 17:07.597
I AM PREPARED TO... LIE.

17:07.597 --> 17:09.598
MM.

17:09.598 --> 17:12.662
SO DO YOU THINK YOU CAN HELP ME
PUT MENOPAUSE ON PAUSE?

17:12.662 --> 17:15.565
I THINK SO. WE HAVE A DUTY
AS WOMAN OF A CERTAIN AGE

17:15.565 --> 17:17.567
TO KEEP THIS SIZZLING
RELATIONSHIP GOING.

17:17.567 --> 17:19.569
SO LET'S TALK
ABOUT SOME THERAPIES.

17:19.569 --> 17:21.570
(sighs)

17:23.313 --> 17:25.244
(inhales deeply)

17:25.244 --> 17:28.548
(knocks on door)

17:28.548 --> 17:30.550
HEY! I WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
AND THOUGHT,

17:30.550 --> 17:32.552
YOU KNOW WHO I HAVEN'T
SEEN LATELY? GABY.

17:32.552 --> 17:33.583
OH.

17:33.583 --> 17:34.784
OKAY.

17:34.784 --> 17:37.056
I'D LOVE TO CATCH UP,
BUT IT'S 11:00,

17:37.056 --> 17:40.059
AND I WAS ABOUT TO GO TO--
 SO HOW ARE THINGS?

17:40.059 --> 17:43.733
LOVE THE HIGHLIGHTS. YOU TOTALLY
MAKE THOSE SHOES WORK.

17:43.733 --> 17:46.266
THEY'RE SLIPPERS.
 UH-HUH. UH-HUH.
SO THAT WAS FUN.

17:46.266 --> 17:48.838
HEY, TALKED TO BOB LATELY?
ANYTHING NEW GOING ON WITH BOB?

17:48.838 --> 17:50.470
I DON'T THINK SO.

17:50.470 --> 17:54.204
DON'T COVER FOR HIM.
HE'S SEEING SOMEONE.

17:54.204 --> 17:56.546
WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?

17:56.546 --> 17:59.109
JASON TOLD HUNTER
WHO TOLD SERGIO WHO TOLD ME

17:59.109 --> 18:02.252
THAT BOB HAS BEEN SEEN OUT THREE
 TIMES WITH SOME HUNKY LATINO.

18:02.252 --> 18:04.614
NO, NO, NO.
BOB'S NOT SEEING ANYONE.

18:04.614 --> 18:06.616
OH, FINE.
THEN I WILL GO TELL HUNTER

18:06.616 --> 18:08.618
TO TELL SERGIO TO TELL JASON
THAT HE'S A LIAR.

18:08.618 --> 18:11.421
NO. NO, NO, NO, NO.
THE HUNKY LATINO IS CARLOS.

18:11.421 --> 18:13.423
HE AND BOB
HAVE BEEN HANGING OUT.

18:13.423 --> 18:15.365
WHAT?

18:15.365 --> 18:17.397
YEAH. SO YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

18:17.397 --> 18:18.698
NO. NO, NO.

18:18.698 --> 18:21.531
THAT--THAT MEANS WE BOTH HAVE
SOMETHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

18:21.531 --> 18:23.633
HUH?
 LOOK, I HATE
TO BREAK IT TO YOU,

18:23.633 --> 18:26.476
BUT BOB'S ALWAYS HAD
A MAJOR CRUSH ON CARLOS.

18:26.476 --> 18:29.108
WHAT? (laughs) I HATE
TO BREAK IT TO BOB,

18:29.108 --> 18:31.281
BUT CARLOS IS AS STRAIGHT
AS THEY COME.

18:31.281 --> 18:33.813
SO WAS BOB'S COLLEGE ROOMMATE
AND HIS THESIS ADVISOR

18:33.813 --> 18:36.216
AND HIS BASKETBALL COACH!

18:36.216 --> 18:38.188
OH, THAT'S WHY
HE LIKES BASKETBALL.

18:38.188 --> 18:40.320
BOB'S COLLEGE NICKNAME
WAS "FLIPPER,"

18:40.320 --> 18:42.422
AND IT WASN'T BECAUSE
OF HIS DOLPHIN TATTOO.

18:42.422 --> 18:44.424
(scoffs)
OKAY, THIS IS CRAZY.

18:44.424 --> 18:47.457
BOB ISN'T
GOING TO "FLIP" CARLOS.
 OKAY, LET ME--
LET ME TELL YOU HIS GAME.

18:47.457 --> 18:49.459
FIRST, HE TAKES THEM
OUT DRINKING,

18:49.459 --> 18:51.431
THEN HE GETS THEM
REALLY HAMMERED.

18:51.431 --> 18:54.534
THEN, WHEN THEIR DEFENSES
ARE DOWN, HE FLIPS 'EM.

18:54.534 --> 18:56.506
WELL, I MEAN, NOT LITERALLY--

18:56.506 --> 18:58.908
YEAH, ACTUALLY,
SOMETIMES LITERALLY.

18:58.908 --> 19:01.371
UM, LEE, I THINK I KNOW
MY HUSBAND.

19:01.371 --> 19:03.373
HE'S NOT PASSING UP
THESE CHIMICHANGAS

19:03.373 --> 19:06.916
FOR A PLATE
OF FRANKS AND BEANS.
 OKAY, I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS,

19:06.916 --> 19:09.479
BUT YOU JUST RUINED
MEXICAN FOOD FOR ME.

19:09.479 --> 19:12.252
(car door opens)
 MM.

19:12.252 --> 19:16.286
(both speaking indistinctly)

19:16.286 --> 19:18.458
OH, MY GOD. I CAN'T LET BOB
SEE ME LIKE THIS.

19:18.458 --> 19:21.160
WELL, USE THE BACK DOOR.
 I ALWAYS DO.

19:25.665 --> 19:26.866
HEY!

19:26.866 --> 19:29.869
WHERE YOU GUYS BEEN?
THE GAME ENDED HOURS AGO.

19:29.869 --> 19:31.871
WE WENT OUT TO A BAR.

19:31.871 --> 19:34.874
HE KEPT BUYING ME DRINKS.
I'M SO HAMMERED. (laughs)
 (laughs)

19:38.278 --> 19:39.449
PSST!

19:52.592 --> 19:54.594
SO I'VE COME UP WITH A MARKETING
PLAN AND A BILLING STRUCTURE.

19:54.594 --> 19:56.666
OH, AND I FILED FOR A LICENSE
WITH THE CITY

19:56.666 --> 19:59.729
SO WE CAN GET A DISCOUNT...
(singsongy) WITH OUR SUPPLIERS.

19:59.729 --> 20:02.272
ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?

20:02.272 --> 20:06.336
I'M SORRY. THAT WAS SO DULL,
I ACTUALLY STARTED TO DREAM.

20:06.336 --> 20:07.337
(hisses)

20:07.337 --> 20:08.478
(footsteps approaching)

20:08.478 --> 20:10.540
HEY! HOW'S IT GOING?

20:10.540 --> 20:12.982
OH. FINE. PAIGE IS ASLEEP.

20:12.982 --> 20:15.515
THAT QUICKLY?

20:15.515 --> 20:17.387
WHAT'S YOUR SECRET? WHISKEY?

20:17.387 --> 20:19.589
I'M NOT JUDGING.
I JUST WANNA KNOW.

20:19.589 --> 20:22.422
NO, JUST ROCKED HER.

20:22.422 --> 20:25.925
HEY, HAVE YOU HEARD FROM MIKE?
HOW'S ALASKA?

20:25.925 --> 20:29.859
UH, HE'S FINE.
THANKS FOR ASKING.

20:32.662 --> 20:34.334
DID YOU GUYS KNOW

20:34.334 --> 20:38.368
THAT THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND
CAN FIT INTO ALASKA 424 TIMES?

20:39.839 --> 20:43.313
READ THAT ONCE ON A CUP.
NEVER FORGOT IT.

20:43.313 --> 20:47.577
WHEN WE'RE WOOING CLIENTS,
LET ME DO THE TALKING.

20:47.577 --> 20:50.280
(hisses)
 SO, UH, SINCE I'M NOT BUSY,

20:50.280 --> 20:52.752
WHERE DO YOU KEEP
YOUR DIRTY LAUNDRY?

20:52.752 --> 20:55.585
OH. (sighs) HONEY, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THE LAUNDRY.

20:55.585 --> 20:57.587
SIT DOWN. I'LL OPEN SOME WINE.

20:57.587 --> 21:00.560
NO, THANKS. I'M ON THE CLOCK.
I'D RATHER GET WORK DONE.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.392
WELL, IF YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING TO DO,

21:02.392 --> 21:04.734
I'D LOVE SOME MORE ICED TEA.

21:04.734 --> 21:06.736
RENEE, THAT IS NOT HER JOB.

21:06.736 --> 21:08.398
(Paige crying)

21:08.398 --> 21:10.039
THAT IS HER JOB.

21:10.039 --> 21:12.842
(crying continues)

21:12.842 --> 21:15.405
SUSAN, I DIDN'T MEAN
YOU NEEDED--

21:15.405 --> 21:18.608
YOU'RE RIGHT. THIS IS MY JOB.

21:21.381 --> 21:23.313
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, MAMA.

21:23.313 --> 21:26.316
HE WON'T TELL ME WHY HE'S TRYING
TO BUY ALL THESE HOUSES.

21:26.316 --> 21:28.388
AND NOW HE'S GOT A MURDERER
MOVING INTO ONE OF THEM.

21:34.624 --> 21:38.398
HOLD ON.

21:38.398 --> 21:40.500
I'VE GOT AN IDEA.

21:46.436 --> 21:47.807
WELL, HELLO THERE.

21:47.807 --> 21:50.309
PAUL WENT TO THE STORE.

21:53.082 --> 21:55.345
WILL HE BE GONE
FOR A WHILE?

21:55.345 --> 21:56.346
YEAH.

21:57.947 --> 22:02.321
IT SURE IS A MESS IN HERE.

22:02.321 --> 22:05.455
CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER
WHAT YOU BOYS ARE UP TO.

22:05.455 --> 22:08.458
YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON?
TALK TO YOUR HUSBAND.

22:08.458 --> 22:11.361
YOU SAW ME. I TRIED.

22:11.361 --> 22:13.863
HE'S KEEPING ME IN THE DARK
FOR SOME REASON.

22:13.863 --> 22:15.565
THAT'S BETWEEN YOU AND HIM.

22:19.409 --> 22:20.870
(sawing resumes)

22:20.870 --> 22:23.443
YOU WANT TO KEEP HIS CONFIDENCE.

22:23.443 --> 22:25.845
I GET THAT.

22:25.845 --> 22:28.648
BUT, PLEASE...
I'M JUST SO WORRIED.

22:28.648 --> 22:30.420
(saw clatters)

22:30.420 --> 22:34.624
LADY, I'M NOT COMFORTABLE
WITH YOU GETTIN' THIS CLOSE.

22:34.624 --> 22:35.755
WHY?

22:35.755 --> 22:37.056
(exhales deeply)

22:37.056 --> 22:39.358
OH!

22:39.358 --> 22:40.890
YOU'RE A PAROLEE.

22:40.890 --> 22:43.793
YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO GET
IN ANY TROUBLE, CAN YOU?

22:43.793 --> 22:45.034
THAT'S RIGHT.

22:45.034 --> 22:47.837
IF YOU GOT ACCUSED
OF A CRIME,

22:47.837 --> 22:50.039
THEY MIGHT LOCK YOU UP
FOR GOOD.

22:50.039 --> 22:53.543
HUH?

22:53.543 --> 22:55.805
(sniffles)

22:55.805 --> 22:57.407
(fabric rips)

22:57.407 --> 23:00.950
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
 WHEN I TELL PEOPLE
YOU ATTACKED ME,

23:00.950 --> 23:02.952
I WANT IT TO LOOK REALISTIC.

23:02.952 --> 23:05.054
WHAT THE HELL?
I NEVER HURT A WOMAN IN MY LIFE!

23:05.054 --> 23:08.157
YOU THINK THE POLICE
ARE GONNA CARE ABOUT THAT?

23:10.620 --> 23:12.391
YOU'RE A CONVICTED FELON.

23:12.391 --> 23:15.895
YOU CAN'T BE DOING THIS.
I ALREADY GOT TWO STRIKES.

23:15.895 --> 23:18.598
I DON'T LIKE TO BE UNPLEASANT,
MR. YEAGER.

23:18.598 --> 23:20.970
REALLY, I DON'T.

23:20.970 --> 23:25.104
BUT I AM GOING TO FIND OUT
WHAT MY HUSBAND IS UP TO,

23:25.104 --> 23:28.407
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

23:31.781 --> 23:33.182
(sighs)

23:33.182 --> 23:34.544
HEY, HON.

23:34.544 --> 23:36.446
WE HAVE TO TAKE THE GIRLS
SHOE SHOPPING THIS WEEKEND.

23:36.446 --> 23:38.448
WHAT'S BETTER FOR YOU,
SATURDAY OR SUNDAY?

23:38.448 --> 23:40.450
NEITHER. I'M GOING TO
RANCHO PINES FOR THE WEEKEND.

23:40.450 --> 23:42.452
OR YOU'RE GONNA PLAY GOLF?
THIS SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

23:42.452 --> 23:44.994
YEAH. BOB INVITED ME.

23:44.994 --> 23:47.196
BOB?
YOU'RE GOING WITH BOB?

23:47.196 --> 23:49.959
UH-HUH. HE GOT US A SUITE
AT THE LODGE.

23:49.959 --> 23:52.932
OH. SO THIS IS
A-A SLEEPOVER?

23:52.932 --> 23:54.934
WELL, IT'S A 6:00 A.M.
TEE TIME.

23:54.934 --> 23:57.036
BOB SAYS THAT'LL BE
A LOT EASIER.

23:57.036 --> 23:59.939
I BET HE DID.

23:59.939 --> 24:02.211
BUT WHY NOT
GET YOUR OWN ROOM?

24:02.211 --> 24:05.074
BOB SAYS HE GOT
THE LAST ONE AVAILABLE.

24:05.074 --> 24:07.677
WOW, YOU'RE JUST TRUSTIN' BOB
LEFT AND RIGHT, AREN'T YA?

24:07.677 --> 24:09.078
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

24:09.078 --> 24:12.522
I'M JUST SURPRISED, THAT'S ALL.
ONE WEEK, WE HATE THE GAYS.

24:12.522 --> 24:15.024
THE NEXT WEEK,
WE LET 'EM WATCH US SHOWER.

24:15.024 --> 24:17.026
IT'S KINDA KOOKY,
DON'T YOU THINK?

24:17.026 --> 24:19.158
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

24:19.158 --> 24:22.161
OH, OPEN YOUR EYES! THIS TRIP
IS NOT ABOUT GOLF FOR BOB.

24:22.161 --> 24:25.164
IT IS ABOUT...
(whispers) SEDUCTION!
 (laughs) REALLY? THAT'S GREAT,

24:25.164 --> 24:28.037
'CAUSE I WAS ACTUALLY PLANNING
ON TURNING GAY THIS WEEKEND.

24:28.037 --> 24:30.670
DON'T JOKE LIKE THAT.
CAN'T YOU TELL I'M UPSET?

24:30.670 --> 24:32.672
I CAN, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY.

24:32.672 --> 24:35.044
EVEN IF BOB WANTED
TO SEDUCE ME, WHICH I DOUBT,

24:35.044 --> 24:37.907
DO YOU REALLY THINK
I'D GO ALONG WITH IT?
 WELL, NO.

24:37.907 --> 24:42.712
THEN WHY DOES THIS BOTHER YOU
SO MUCH?
 I DON'T KNOW! IT JUST DOES!

24:42.712 --> 24:45.655
(sighs)

24:45.655 --> 24:48.558
FINE. I WON'T GO.

24:48.558 --> 24:50.089
REALLY?

24:52.161 --> 24:55.494
OH. THANK YOU.

24:55.494 --> 24:57.997
I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T WANT
TO DO ANYTHING

24:57.997 --> 25:00.069
THAT MAKES YOU THINK I'M GAY.

25:00.069 --> 25:02.071
IN THAT CASE,
DITCH THE MOISTURIZER.

25:03.803 --> 25:06.906
OH, I REALLY HOPE
YOUR PARENTS LIKE ME.

25:06.906 --> 25:08.838
RELAX. I ALREADY LAID
THE GROUNDWORK.

25:08.838 --> 25:10.840
I TOLD THEM YOU WERE SMART
AND BEAUTIFUL

25:10.840 --> 25:12.842
AND A TERRIFIC COOK.
THANK YOU.

25:12.842 --> 25:14.844
AND WHAT DID THEY SAY
ABOUT THE AGE DIFFERENCE?

25:14.844 --> 25:16.846
NOTHING. I DIDN'T TELL THEM.
 WHAT? WHY?

25:16.846 --> 25:18.848
BECAUSE YOU LOOK SO FANTASTIC...
 (sighs)

25:18.848 --> 25:21.751
I DON'T EVEN THINK
THEY'RE GONNA NOTICE.
 BUT I DON'T WANT THEM TO THINK

25:21.751 --> 25:24.523
WE'RE TRYING
TO PUT ONE OVER ON THEM.
 HERE WE GO.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.525
DAD, MOM,
I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET BREE.

25:26.525 --> 25:29.929
WELL, HI. I'M RICHARD.

25:29.929 --> 25:32.131
THIS IS MY WIFE MARY.

25:33.833 --> 25:36.606
WELL...

25:36.606 --> 25:38.568
CHECK YOU OUT.

25:49.849 --> 25:51.821
BREE,

25:51.821 --> 25:54.053
KEITH TELLS US
YOU'RE A PROFESSIONAL CHEF.

25:54.053 --> 25:57.056
I WAS.
NOW I JUST COOK FOR FUN.

25:57.056 --> 26:00.590
OH. ME, I'M RETIRED
FROM THE ARMY.

26:00.590 --> 26:04.293
SO AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T COME
IN A CAN, IT TASTES GOOD TO ME.

26:04.293 --> 26:07.566
OH, A MILITARY MAN. YOU MUST
HAVE SOME FASCINATING STORIES.

26:07.566 --> 26:10.169
AH, NO. MARY'S THE ONE
WITH THE STORIES.

26:10.169 --> 26:11.871
(Keith chuckles)

26:11.871 --> 26:14.203
GUESS WHAT SHE DOES
FOR A LIVING.

26:14.203 --> 26:18.247
(gasps)
YES, TAKE A WILD GUESS.

26:18.247 --> 26:20.179
SHE'S A DOCTOR.

26:20.179 --> 26:22.652
(chuckles)
 AS MATTER OF FACT,

26:22.652 --> 26:26.085
I HAVE A BRAND-NEW,
INCREDIBLE WORK STORY.

26:26.085 --> 26:28.117
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR IT?

26:28.117 --> 26:31.120
NO. (laughs) NO, BECAUSE
I REALIZE THAT AS A DOCTOR,

26:31.120 --> 26:32.822
YOU'RE PREVENTED ETHICALLY

26:32.822 --> 26:35.094
FROM TALKING ABOUT
YOUR... PATIENTS. (chuckles)

26:35.094 --> 26:38.127
DEPENDS HOW DRUNK I AM.

26:40.830 --> 26:42.131
SO THE ARMY...

26:42.131 --> 26:45.274
CAN I JUST THANK YOU
FOR KEEPING OUR COUNTRY SAFE?

26:45.274 --> 26:47.807
LET'S TALK ABOUT YOU, BREE.

26:47.807 --> 26:50.640
I DON'T KNOW IF
YOU REALIZE THIS, BUT YOU ARE

26:50.640 --> 26:53.282
THE FIRST GIRLFRIEND THAT KEITH
HAS INTRODUCED TO US TO...
 MM.

26:53.282 --> 26:55.885
SO YOU MUST BE VERY SPECIAL.

26:55.885 --> 26:57.947
YES. KEITH, IT SEEMS SERIOUS.

26:57.947 --> 26:59.949
I MEAN, IS--IS BREE THE ONE

26:59.949 --> 27:03.292
WHO'S GONNA BE GIVING ME
MY GRANDCHILDREN?

27:03.292 --> 27:05.895
MOM...
 HUH?

27:05.895 --> 27:07.897
IGNORE MARY.
NO, NO, NO, IGNORE MARY.
 I--

27:07.897 --> 27:10.099
GRANDCHILDREN
ARE HER BIG THING.
 WELL, NO, I JUST THINK

27:10.099 --> 27:12.631
THAT WHEN YOU REACH THIS POINT
IN A RELATIONSHIP,

27:12.631 --> 27:16.205
IT'S SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD TALK ABOUT.
 WELL, THERE'S PLENTY
OF TIME FOR THAT.

27:16.205 --> 27:18.868
NO, NOT AS MUCH
AS YOU MAY THINK. WAITER!

27:18.868 --> 27:20.039
MARY!

27:20.039 --> 27:23.372
STOP IT. I THINK
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING BREE.

27:23.372 --> 27:26.846
OH, NO, NO, I'M FINE. IT'S JUST
A LITTLE... WARM IN HERE.

27:26.846 --> 27:28.848
(lowered voice) ARE YOU SURE?
'CAUSE THIS IS

27:28.848 --> 27:31.180
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU
AT THE PARK THE OTHER DAY.

27:31.180 --> 27:34.754
(sighs) MOM,
COULD YOU TAKE A LOOK AT HER?

27:34.754 --> 27:36.285
OF COURSE.

27:36.285 --> 27:39.288
BREE, WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
YOUR SYMPTOMS?

27:39.288 --> 27:42.431
(swallows) HONESTLY,
IT'S NOTHING. (chuckles)

27:42.431 --> 27:44.794
I JUST GET A LITTLE WARM
SOMETIMES.

27:44.794 --> 27:48.798
WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE SENSATION
COMES ON SUDDENLY,

27:48.798 --> 27:50.239
LIKE A...

27:50.239 --> 27:52.872
LIKE A FLASH OF HOTNESS?

27:52.872 --> 27:54.844
NO. NOT AT ALL.
(chuckles)

27:54.844 --> 27:56.806
LET'S JUST... DROP IT.

27:56.806 --> 28:00.009
WELL, YOU SEEM SO IRRITATED.
BEFORE, YOU WERE SO PLEASANT.

28:00.009 --> 28:05.454
WOULD YOU SAY THAT YOUR MOODS
 SWING SUDDENLY LIKE THIS?

28:05.454 --> 28:07.917
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
STOP BADGERING.
 I JUST... (sighs)

28:07.917 --> 28:11.721
I'M NOT BADGERING. I'M SIMPLY
ASKING HER TO TELL THE TRUTH.

28:11.721 --> 28:13.723
IS--IS THAT SOMETHING

28:13.723 --> 28:15.895
THAT'S ALSO DIFFICULT
FOR YOU THESE DAYS, BREE?

28:15.895 --> 28:18.868
TELLING THE TRUTH?
 OH, FOR GOD SAKE!

28:18.868 --> 28:21.700
(sighs) I AM GOING THROUGH
MENOPAUSE, OKAY?!

28:23.302 --> 28:26.906
THAT IS WHAT DR. WAGNER
IS SO DELICATELY TRYING TO SAY.

28:26.906 --> 28:29.208
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I AN GOING TO THE KITCHEN

28:29.208 --> 28:32.211
TO ASK THEM IF I CAN STAND
IN THEIR WALK-IN FREEZER!

28:37.947 --> 28:41.220
GUESS WHAT ELSE?

28:41.220 --> 28:45.855
THAT'S NOT
HER REAL HAIR COLOR EITHER.

28:45.855 --> 28:47.296
OKAY.

28:47.296 --> 28:48.858
SORRY.

28:48.858 --> 28:51.801
WE SHOULD GET GOING, BARBARA.
WE HAVE A 7:00 RESERVATION.

28:51.801 --> 28:53.763
(singsongy) AND WE HAVE
A WHOLE PRESENTATION FOR YOU

28:53.763 --> 28:55.004
AFTER DESSERT.

28:55.004 --> 28:57.266
OH, I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN WAIT THAT LONG.

28:57.266 --> 29:00.439
CAN I HAVE A SNEAK PEEK?
 UM...

29:00.439 --> 29:02.972
SURE.
 (door closes)

29:05.374 --> 29:08.347
THIS IS
FOR YOUR DAUGHTER'S ROOM.

29:08.347 --> 29:09.849
UH, WE WERE THINKING

29:09.849 --> 29:12.151
ALL THE FURNITURE
IN AN ANTIQUE WHITE,

29:12.151 --> 29:15.454
AND, UH, PALE ROSE
FOR THE WALLS.

29:15.454 --> 29:17.126
IT'S BOTH ELEGANT AND FEMININE.

29:17.126 --> 29:20.429
YOU DON'T FEEL IT MIGHT BE
A LITTLE OLD FOR HER?

29:20.429 --> 29:21.991
SHE'S ONLY 7.

29:21.991 --> 29:25.434
OH, NO. NO, TRUST ME.
THIS COLOR WORKS FOR ALL AGES.

29:25.434 --> 29:27.136
IT'S A--IT'S A CLASSIC LOOK.
 MM.

29:27.136 --> 29:30.769
OR...

29:30.769 --> 29:33.973
JUST AN IDEA, BUT MAYBE YOU
COULD DO SOMETHING MORE PLAYFUL.

29:33.973 --> 29:37.006
I PAINTED THE CHARACTERS FROM
THE KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE

29:37.006 --> 29:39.809
IN MY SON'S ROOM,
AND HE LOVED IT.

29:39.809 --> 29:42.481
AND MAYBE YOU DAUGHTER
HAS A FAVORITE CHARACTER

29:42.481 --> 29:44.814
FROM A-A-A MOVIE OR A BOOK?

29:44.814 --> 29:47.786
I'M SORRY. WE HAVEN'T BEEN
INTRODUCED. I'M BARBARA FINE.

29:47.786 --> 29:49.388
UH, THIS IS SUSAN DELFINO.

29:49.388 --> 29:52.521
THE NANNY.

29:52.521 --> 29:55.424
WELL, SUSAN,
IT'S A GREAT IDEA.

29:55.424 --> 29:57.827
I'M GONNA CALL MY DAUGHTER
AND SEE IF THERE ARE

29:57.827 --> 29:59.568
ANY CHARACTERS THAT SHE WOULD
LOVE TO SEE ON HER WALL.

29:59.568 --> 30:02.271
YOU SHOULD SHOW HER
YOUR OTHER SKETCHES. SHE'S GOOD.

30:02.271 --> 30:04.133
(Lynette and Susan chuckle)

30:07.276 --> 30:09.578
(lowered voice)
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

30:09.578 --> 30:13.442
UH, IT--IT WAS JUST A THOUGHT.
I THINK SHE LIKED IT.

30:13.442 --> 30:15.845
I DON'T CARE! YOU MADE US
LOOK LIKE IDIOTS.

30:15.845 --> 30:17.416
THAT WAS NOT MY INTENTION.

30:17.416 --> 30:20.349
REGARDLESS, I DO NOT
APPRECIATE BEING UPSTAGED

30:20.349 --> 30:22.491
BY THE WOMAN
WHO DOES THE DISHES.

30:22.491 --> 30:24.954
(door slams)

30:24.954 --> 30:27.596
SHE HAD NO RIGHT
TO TALK TO YOU LIKE THAT--

30:27.596 --> 30:29.098
NO, NO.

30:29.098 --> 30:32.061
I... CROSSED THE LINE.

30:34.603 --> 30:37.266
OKAY, DONE.
YOU READY TO GO?

30:40.069 --> 30:41.310
YEAH.

30:52.882 --> 30:55.354
HEY, BOB, CAN I BORROW
A COUPLE OF EGGS?

30:58.587 --> 31:01.330
(door closes)

31:02.892 --> 31:05.394
HEY. WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT ABOUT?

31:05.394 --> 31:08.597
YOUR HUSBAND CANCELED
OUR GOLF TRIP.

31:08.597 --> 31:10.369
DID HE?

31:10.369 --> 31:13.042
HE SAID YOU THINK
I'M PLANNING TO SEDUCE HIM.

31:14.873 --> 31:18.447
WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THAT...
AFTER I GET THE EGGS.

31:18.447 --> 31:21.280
WHY WOULD YOU EVEN GO THERE?

31:21.280 --> 31:24.553
(sighs) LOOK, I KNOW
ABOUT YOUR HISTORY, BOB...

31:24.553 --> 31:26.615
OR SHOULD I SAY "FLIPPER"?

31:26.615 --> 31:29.318
AH. WELL,
LEE'S A FINE ONE TO TALK.

31:29.318 --> 31:32.461
DID HE TELL YOU ABOUT THE SUMMER
HE STALKED RYAN SEACREST?

31:32.461 --> 31:34.423
OKAY, LOOK, I DON'T WANT
TO FIGHT ABOUT THIS.

31:34.423 --> 31:37.196
HOW COULD YOU THINK THAT, GABY?
YOU KNOW ME.

31:37.196 --> 31:39.198
NO, I DON'T!
I THOUGHT I DID.

31:39.198 --> 31:40.499
I THOUGHT YOU WERE

31:40.499 --> 31:43.072
A FUN GAY GUY WHO I HAD
SOMETHING IN COMMON WITH,

31:43.072 --> 31:45.074
AND THEN I FIND OUT
YOU'RE INTO SPORTS

31:45.074 --> 31:47.076
AND SPENDING TIME
WITH MY HUSBAND.

31:47.076 --> 31:50.509
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT ABOUT?
 IT'S ABOUT ME BEING LONELY!

31:50.509 --> 31:53.512
YOU EVER SEE ANYBODY
COMING AROUND HERE TO VISIT ME?

31:53.512 --> 31:56.485
YOU EVER SEE ME GOING OUT
ON A SATURDAY NIGHT?

31:56.485 --> 31:58.287
EVER SINCE LEE LEFT,

31:58.287 --> 32:01.490
ALL I DO IS WORK AND COME HOME
TO AN EMPTY HOUSE.

32:04.223 --> 32:07.496
YOU KNOW, I WAS SO HAPPY TO GET
YOUR INVITATION TO DINNER.

32:07.496 --> 32:09.498
AND WHEN CARLOS WANTED
TO HANG OUT,

32:09.498 --> 32:12.361
I THOUGHT, THIS IS GREAT.
I GOT A SOCIAL LIFE AGAIN.

32:12.361 --> 32:17.006
NOW TO FIND OUT
YOU THOUGHT I HAD AN AGENDA?

32:19.538 --> 32:21.940
OH, BOB. I'M SORRY.
I-I DIDN'T KNOW.

32:21.940 --> 32:24.573
WELL... NOW YOU DO.

32:27.516 --> 32:29.518
LET ME GET THOSE EGGS
FOR YOU.

32:32.581 --> 32:34.583
CARLOS CAN GO
ON THE WEEKEND.

32:37.086 --> 32:38.257
REALLY?

32:38.257 --> 32:40.259
YEAH.

32:41.690 --> 32:43.462
THANKS.

32:45.464 --> 32:48.067
OH!

32:48.067 --> 32:50.069
AND IF YOU EVER
 DO FEEL THE NEED

32:50.069 --> 32:52.071
TO FLIP A STRAIGHT GUY
ON THE LANE,

32:52.071 --> 32:54.073
I'D START WITH TOM SCAVO.

32:54.073 --> 32:56.345
I ALWAYS FELT
HE WAS THREE BEERS AWAY.

32:56.345 --> 32:57.706
TWO.

32:57.706 --> 32:59.408
(laughs)

33:08.157 --> 33:10.319
HOW WAS YOUR MEETING?

33:10.319 --> 33:12.291
GOOD.

33:12.291 --> 33:15.564
BARBARA'S GOING TO HIRE US.
WE'RE OFFICIALLY A DESIGN FIRM.

33:17.366 --> 33:18.567
THAT'S GREAT.

33:20.429 --> 33:22.331
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

33:22.331 --> 33:24.403
ARE YOU UPSET
WITH THIS ARRANGEMENT?

33:24.403 --> 33:27.076
BECAUSE I'M GETTING A VIBE.

33:27.076 --> 33:31.580
(Paige coos)

33:31.580 --> 33:33.282
I SHOULD GO.

33:35.484 --> 33:39.688
YOU ARE OUT OF DIAPERS.
I'LL PICK SOME UP TOMORROW.

33:39.688 --> 33:43.492
SUSAN, PLEASE. I NEED TO KNOW.
ARE YOU ANGRY WITH ME?

33:45.354 --> 33:47.426
YES. YES, I'M ANGRY.

33:47.426 --> 33:49.598
WHY? ALL I DID WAS
GIVE YOU A JOB.

33:49.598 --> 33:53.062
YEAH, THE WRONG JOB.

33:53.062 --> 33:56.065
WHEN RENEE CALLED ME,
I THOUGHT YOU WERE ASKING ME

33:56.065 --> 33:59.438
TO WORK WITH YOU
IN THE DESIGN FIRM.
 OH, NO!

33:59.438 --> 34:01.440
I WAS SO EXCITED.
I KNEW I'D BE GOOD AT THAT.

34:01.440 --> 34:04.443
AND THEN I FIND OUT YOU JUST
WANT ME TO BE YOUR NANNY.

34:04.443 --> 34:07.446
I HAD NO IDEA.
 BUT YOU KNOW--
AND DON'T GET ME WRONG,

34:07.446 --> 34:11.420
I LOVE YOU FOR THE GESTURE,
BUT I HATE YOU FOR IT, TOO,

34:11.420 --> 34:14.253
BECAUSE I'M NOT
IN THE POSITION TO SAY NO.

34:14.253 --> 34:15.754
(Paige fusses)

34:15.754 --> 34:18.226
I-I AM BEYOND SORRY.

34:20.159 --> 34:22.331
IT'S OKAY.

34:22.331 --> 34:24.333
IT'S JUST THIS AWFUL REMINDER

34:24.333 --> 34:27.166
THAT ALL OF MY FRIENDS
LOOK AT MY DIFFERENTLY NOW.

34:27.166 --> 34:29.297
I'M THE POOR ONE.

34:29.297 --> 34:31.340
SUSAN!

34:31.340 --> 34:34.072
THESE MONEY TROUBLES--
THEY'RE TEMPORARY,

34:34.072 --> 34:36.375
BUT HOW WE FEEL ABOUT YOU,
OUR FRIENDSHIP--

34:36.375 --> 34:38.677
THAT'S NEVER GOING TO CHANGE.

34:42.551 --> 34:45.154
THANK YOU FOR THAT.

34:45.154 --> 34:47.315
OHH, COME HERE.

34:49.358 --> 34:53.462
YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER SAID THIS
TO A NANNY BEFORE...

34:53.462 --> 34:56.465
HOW ABOUT WE GO DOWNSTAIRS
AND GET A LITTLE DRUNK?

34:56.465 --> 34:57.766
(laughs)

34:57.766 --> 34:59.468
(sniffles)

34:59.468 --> 35:01.800
WELL, YOU'RE THE BOSS.

35:01.800 --> 35:03.332
(laughs)

35:08.277 --> 35:10.779
ARE YOU COMING TO BED?

35:10.779 --> 35:13.212
I WANNA MAKE LOVE AGAIN.

35:15.244 --> 35:17.246
WITH AN INVITATION
LIKE THAT...

35:17.246 --> 35:19.117
NO.

35:20.689 --> 35:22.421
LET ME.

35:22.421 --> 35:25.194
YOU'VE TURNED OUT TO BE
THE PERFECT WIFE.

35:25.194 --> 35:27.296
THAT'S SWEET,

35:27.296 --> 35:29.258
BUT NOT ENTIRELY TRUE.

35:29.258 --> 35:32.231
YOU DON'T THINK
I'M TRUSTWORTHY.

35:32.231 --> 35:33.602
WHAT?

35:33.602 --> 35:36.465
YOU WON'T TELL ME WHY
YOU'RE MOVING YOUR EX-CELLMATE

35:36.465 --> 35:38.136
INTO YOUR OLD HOUSE.

35:38.136 --> 35:39.368
(sighs)

35:39.368 --> 35:42.441
DARLING, I'D PREFER
NOT TO DISCUSS THAT RIGHT NOW.

35:42.441 --> 35:44.313
WE DON'T NEED TO.

35:44.313 --> 35:46.475
YEAGER ALREADY TOLD ME
WHAT YOU'RE UP TO.

35:47.916 --> 35:49.147
WHAT?

35:49.147 --> 35:51.480
WE HAD A NICE LONG CHAT.

35:51.480 --> 35:55.454
HE TOLD ME WHAT YOU'VE
GOT PLANNED FOR OUR NEIGHBORS.

35:55.454 --> 35:59.528
I MUST SAY, I WAS SHOCKED...

35:59.528 --> 36:01.590
TO SAY THE LEAST.
 (belt clatters)

36:01.590 --> 36:05.734
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING
MIGHT SOUND CRAZY TO YOU,

36:05.734 --> 36:08.937
BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW MUCH I DESPISE THESE PEOPLE.

36:08.937 --> 36:11.940
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH
I NEED THESE PEOPLE TO SUFFER

36:11.940 --> 36:13.942
FOR WHAT THEY DID TO ME.

36:13.942 --> 36:16.645
WELL, THAT'S WHERE
YOU'RE WRONG, PAUL.

36:16.645 --> 36:18.877
(inhales sharply)
 I UNDERSTAND VENGEANCE.

36:18.877 --> 36:20.409
COMPLETELY.

36:29.488 --> 36:32.591
WOW.

36:32.591 --> 36:34.763
YOU REALLY ARE
THE PERFECT WIFE.

36:50.279 --> 36:52.811
I'M SORRY I LEFT THE RESTAURANT
LIKE THAT.

36:52.811 --> 36:55.984
I JUST COULDN'T GO BACK TO
THAT TABLE AND FACE YOUR MOTHER.

36:55.984 --> 36:58.587
OH. (sighs)

36:58.587 --> 37:01.250
WHEW.

37:01.250 --> 37:05.754
SO WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
ABOUT THE WHOLE MENOPAUSE THING?

37:05.754 --> 37:07.796
I WAS AFRAID
OF HOW YOU'D REACT.

37:07.796 --> 37:10.599
YOU REALLY THINK I WOULD CARE
ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

37:10.599 --> 37:12.931
OH, KEITH,

37:12.931 --> 37:14.563
I LIKE YOU...

37:14.563 --> 37:16.935
(chuckles)

37:16.935 --> 37:20.639
MORE THAN
I EVER INTENDED TO.

37:20.639 --> 37:23.472
I ALWAYS KNEW THERE WAS
AN EXPIRATION DATE

37:23.472 --> 37:25.444
ON THIS RELATIONSHIP.

37:25.444 --> 37:27.346
WHAT?

37:27.346 --> 37:31.650
YOU ARE 17 YEARS YOUNGER
THAN ME.

37:31.650 --> 37:33.922
THAT'S A BIG NUMBER.
IT MEANS SOMETHING.

37:33.922 --> 37:35.924
NOT TO ME.

37:35.924 --> 37:37.986
(laughs) IT MIGHT.

37:37.986 --> 37:40.659
THERE ARE
OTHER CONSIDERATIONS.

37:40.659 --> 37:43.261
SO YOU CAN'T GET PREGNANT.

37:43.261 --> 37:44.593
WHO CARES?

37:44.593 --> 37:46.264
THAT DOESN'T BOTHER YOU?

37:46.264 --> 37:47.596
NO.

37:47.596 --> 37:48.897
NO.
 (chuckles)

37:48.897 --> 37:50.399
WE COULD ADOPT.

37:50.399 --> 37:53.572
SO LONG AS I GET TO TEACH
SOMEONE HOW TO THROW A BALL,

37:53.572 --> 37:55.874
I DON'T CARE
WHOSE D.N.A. THEY GOT.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.609
OH, KEITH. (chuckles)

38:02.351 --> 38:05.354
NOT ONLY CAN I NOT
HAVE CHILDREN...

38:08.617 --> 38:10.619
(whispers) I DON'T WANT THEM.

38:12.921 --> 38:15.464
I'VE ALREADY DONE THAT.

38:15.464 --> 38:18.527
IT WAS WONDERFUL,
BUT I'VE DONE IT.

38:25.404 --> 38:27.376
OH. (clears throat)

38:27.376 --> 38:30.709
AND YOU... (chuckles)

38:30.709 --> 38:33.842
YOU ARE GONNA BE
SUCH AN AMAZING FATHER,

38:33.842 --> 38:37.015
AND I WOULD NEVER ASK YOU
TO GIVE UP THAT EXPERIENCE.

38:37.015 --> 38:39.348
WHY ARE WE EVEN TALKING
ABOUT THIS?

38:39.348 --> 38:41.750
I--WE'VE BEEN DATING
FOR TWO MONTHS. WHY...

38:41.750 --> 38:45.093
I--IT'S--IT'S TOO SOON
TO TALK ABOUT KIDS, RIGHT?

38:48.056 --> 38:49.758
(whispers) I SUPPOSE.

38:49.758 --> 38:53.432
LET'S--LET'S TAKE OUR TIME.
I-I JUST WANNA--I...

38:57.966 --> 39:01.670
I-I JUST WANT US
TO KEEP BEING HAPPY, OKAY?

39:01.670 --> 39:02.741
(sighs)

39:25.434 --> 39:28.136
HEY, I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO HEAD OVER TO YOUR PLACE

39:28.136 --> 39:30.639
TO PICK UP CARLOS.
 YEAH, ABOUT THAT...
UH, I'VE DECIDED

39:30.639 --> 39:32.641
CARLOS SHOULDN'T GO WITH YOU
THIS WEEKEND.

39:32.641 --> 39:35.744
WHAT? OH, FOR GOD SAKE.

39:35.744 --> 39:37.846
AH! WAIT! LET ME FINISH!

39:37.846 --> 39:40.378
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT WHAT YOU TOLD ME,

39:40.378 --> 39:43.682
AND I REALIZED THERE'S SOMEBODY
ELSE YOU'D HAVE MORE FUN WITH.

39:48.787 --> 39:50.889
YEAH, GO. SHH!

39:50.889 --> 39:53.622
YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING ME!

39:53.622 --> 39:56.625
(sighs)
 GABY CALLED TO SAY THAT YOU
WERE LONELY AND DEPRESSED,

39:56.625 --> 39:59.097
AND ONCE I STOPPED LAUGHING,
I ACTUALLY FELT BAD FOR YOU.

39:59.097 --> 40:01.099
WE ONLY BROKE UP
FOUR MONTHS AGO.

40:01.099 --> 40:03.632
HOW DID YOU GAIN
THIS MUCH WEIGHT?

40:03.632 --> 40:04.773
(gasps loudly)

40:04.773 --> 40:06.775
OKAY! OKAY, NOW THAT
WE'RE DONE SAYING HELLO,

40:06.775 --> 40:09.137
LET'S TALK ABOUT
THIS FABULOUS WEEKEND.

40:09.137 --> 40:11.910
DID YOU SERIOUSLY THINK
I WOULD TAKE HIM? WE BROKE UP!

40:11.910 --> 40:14.613
AND IT'S TIME TO PUT
THE PIECES BACK TOGETHER.

40:14.613 --> 40:17.115
LET'S BE HONEST. YOU'VE BEEN
MISERABLE WITHOUT LEE.

40:17.115 --> 40:19.117
AND YOU'VE BEEN MISERABLE
WITHOUT BOB.

40:19.117 --> 40:21.920
THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE GETTIN' SO FAT.

40:21.920 --> 40:24.052
YOU MAY NOT THINK
I'M YOUR FRIEND, BUT I AM,

40:24.052 --> 40:26.054
AND I AM SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW

40:26.054 --> 40:28.056
THAT YOU NEED
SOMETHING MORE IN YOUR LIFE

40:28.056 --> 40:31.860
THAN A STRAIGHT GUY
TO GO PLAY GOLF WITH.

40:31.860 --> 40:33.962
YOU NEED SOMEBODY TO LOVE.

40:36.164 --> 40:38.767
AND...

40:38.767 --> 40:41.670
YOU NEED SOMEBODY
WHO WILL LOVE YOU BACK.

40:41.670 --> 40:44.442
GABY, I APPRECIATE
WHAT YOU'RE DOING,

40:44.442 --> 40:47.476
AND I THINK...
LEE KNOWS I STILL LOVE HIM.

40:47.476 --> 40:49.117
BUT... (sighs)

40:49.117 --> 40:51.520
THERE ARE STILL HUGE ISSUES
BETWEEN US.

40:51.520 --> 40:52.681
HUH.

40:52.681 --> 40:54.723
MAYBE IT'S TIME
TO WORK THOSE OUT.

40:54.723 --> 40:56.725
(singsongy) I'D HATE TO SEE

40:56.725 --> 40:58.687
THAT FABULOUS RESORT WEEKEND
GO TO WASTE.

40:58.687 --> 41:00.959
(normal voice) OH, COME ON.
TALK TO EACH OTHER.

41:00.959 --> 41:03.962
DO IT FOR ME, AS YOUR FRIEND.

41:12.771 --> 41:14.773
OH.

41:16.004 --> 41:18.777
OH, I FORGOT.
ONE MORE THING...

41:20.779 --> 41:25.814
OKAY! NEVER MIND.
I'M--I'M GOOD.

41:29.988 --> 41:32.591
(sighs)

41:32.591 --> 41:33.992
(thud)

41:33.992 --> 41:35.924
(gasps)

41:35.924 --> 41:38.266
(sighs)

41:38.266 --> 41:39.598
HUMILIATION...

41:41.600 --> 41:45.704
IT'S NOT ALWAYS SOMETHING
WE CAN AVOID.

41:47.606 --> 41:51.940
WE MAY HAVE WIVES
WHO INSULT OUR MASCULINITY.

41:56.084 --> 41:58.617
WE MAY TAKE JOBS...

41:58.617 --> 42:02.120
WE FEEL ARE BENEATH US.

42:02.120 --> 42:05.724
WE MAY HAVE BOYFRIENDS

42:05.724 --> 42:08.627
WHO MAKE US FEEL OLD.

42:08.627 --> 42:12.230
YES, THERE ARE
ALL SORTS OF WAYS

42:12.230 --> 42:15.063
TO BE HUMILIATED IN LIFE.

42:15.063 --> 42:19.708
BUT THE SUREST WAY
TO GET YOUR DIGNITY BACK

42:19.708 --> 42:23.211
IS TO GET
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR.

42:23.211 --> 42:25.974
I FOUND OUT
WHAT PAUL IS UP TO.

42:25.974 --> 42:28.847
HE TOLD ME EVERYTHING.

42:31.119 --> 42:34.082
OH, BABY.

42:34.082 --> 42:37.656
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

42:39.758 --> 42:41.590
THANK YOU, MAMA.
