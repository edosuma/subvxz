00:58.690 --> 01:00.453
ALL RIGHT.
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME

01:00.490 --> 01:02.720
YOU SAW KEVIN FORD?
TWO WEEKS AGO.

01:02.760 --> 01:04.352
THE NIGHT BEFORE HIS NEIGHBOR
BEAT HIM UP.

01:04.390 --> 01:05.789
AND YOU HAVE NOT
SEEN HIM SINCE?

01:05.830 --> 01:07.525
NOT TODAY? NOT YESTERDAY?

01:07.560 --> 01:08.356
YOU HAVEN'T
DRIVEN BY HIS HOUSE

01:08.400 --> 01:10.220
OR CHECKED UP ON HIM
AT THE HOSPITAL?

01:10.270 --> 01:12.238
SAM,
I SAID I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM.

01:12.270 --> 01:14.488
(cell phone beeps)

01:14.540 --> 01:16.405
HEY, WHAT'S UP?
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LIKE IT.

01:16.440 --> 01:18.431
(scoffs) I CAN'T STAND IT
WHEN YOU OPEN WITH THAT.

01:18.470 --> 01:20.529
DON'T OPEN WITH THAT.
MCNALLY?

01:20.580 --> 01:22.377
(radio chatter)
HIT ME.

01:22.410 --> 01:24.708
I'M IN MARLO'S BASEMENT.
IT'S ALL KEVIN FORD.

01:24.750 --> 01:28.641
MAPS, PHOTOGRAPHS, NOTES,
CHARTS. IT'S...

01:28.680 --> 01:30.284
(sighs) IT'S CRAZY.

01:30.320 --> 01:32.584
Andy she must have been
following this guy for weeks.

01:32.620 --> 01:35.714
LOOK, NO ONE'S SEEN IT YET.

01:35.760 --> 01:38.251
I'M STILL WAITING ON OLIVER.
Okay.

01:38.290 --> 01:41.589
JUST KEEP ME POSTED.

01:41.630 --> 01:43.325
WHAT?

01:45.800 --> 01:46.892
MARLO, I THINK WE NEED
TO TALK ABOUT

01:46.940 --> 01:48.089
WHAT'S IN YOUR BASEMENT.

01:51.470 --> 01:54.234
(radio static)
THIS IS 1527.
I'M STILL WAITING ON BACKUP.

01:54.280 --> 01:55.679
1504, WHAT'S YOUR 20?

01:55.710 --> 01:57.803
(horn blares in distance)

01:57.850 --> 02:01.240
(radio static)
1504, ALMOST THERE.

02:01.280 --> 02:02.417
You okay?
(radio static)

02:02.450 --> 02:03.917
YEAH. YEAH I'M--I'M FINE.

02:03.950 --> 02:07.386
GOOD. SEE YOU SOON.
(radIo static)

02:07.420 --> 02:09.320
(walkie-talkie clicks)

02:09.360 --> 02:12.329
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

02:12.360 --> 02:15.818
(telephone rings in distance)

02:15.860 --> 02:17.760
THANK YOU.
RIGHT ON.

02:17.800 --> 02:19.563
(siren wails in distance,
monitor beeping rhythmically)

02:19.600 --> 02:20.897
(coffee lid clicks)

02:20.940 --> 02:23.329
LISTEN, WES, THERE'S
SOMETHING I NEED TO TELL YOU.

02:24.710 --> 02:28.305
CHLOE AND I ARE, UM...
SEEING EACH OTHER.

02:28.340 --> 02:31.241
(scoffs)
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO?

02:31.280 --> 02:32.076
WELL, 'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,

02:32.110 --> 02:33.418
THIS WHOLE THING
CAUGHT ME OFF GUARD.

02:33.450 --> 02:34.917
I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT YOU.

02:34.950 --> 02:36.611
AND I DIDN'T KNOW
SHE'D BEEN MARRIED.

02:36.650 --> 02:38.641
NOT SURE IF THAT SAYS
MORE ABOUT

02:38.690 --> 02:41.887
MY RELATIONSHIP
WITH HER OR YOURS.
YEAH. ME NEITHER.

02:41.920 --> 02:45.424
IS IT SERIOUS--
YOU AND HER?

02:48.260 --> 02:50.820
YEAH.
YOU HAD TO THINK ABOUT IT.
YOU SURE?

02:50.870 --> 02:52.235
YEAH, BECAUSE THIS IS WEIRD.
OKAY?

02:52.270 --> 02:53.396
I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU.
AND--AN D--AN D--AND--

02:53.440 --> 02:55.635
YOU'RE--YOU'RE ASKING ME
IF I'M SERIOUS--

02:55.670 --> 02:57.365
IF--ABOUT--
MY WIFE.

02:57.410 --> 03:00.937
EXACTLY. SO, YES, WES,
I'M VERY INTO YOUR WIFE.

03:00.980 --> 03:02.641
YOUR WIFE AND I
ARE GOING STEADY.

03:02.680 --> 03:06.275
(scoffs) YOU MAKE HER HAPPY?

03:06.320 --> 03:07.844
I THINK SO.

03:07.880 --> 03:10.246
YOU HAD TO THINK
ABOUT IT AGAIN.
WELL, YOU'RE IMPATIENT.

03:10.290 --> 03:12.417
I'M JUST TRYING TO GAUGE
WHAT I'M UP AGAINST.

03:16.430 --> 03:18.955
(door buzzes,
indistinct conversations)

03:18.990 --> 03:20.924
(telephone ringing in distance,
radio chatter)

03:20.960 --> 03:24.259
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
FORD'S LAWYER JUST GOT HERE.

03:24.300 --> 03:25.824
WHAT'S THAT MEAN?
(beeps)

03:25.870 --> 03:27.462
IT'S THE USUAL, YOU KNOW,
YOU GUYS GOT IT ALL WRONG.

03:27.500 --> 03:30.264
MY CLIENT'S A GREAT GUY,
HE LOVES PUPPIES. HE'S INNOCENT.

03:30.310 --> 03:31.959
MY CLIENT
IS OUT OF HIS MIND.

03:32.010 --> 03:34.570
UH, FORMER CLIENT,
I SHOULD SAY.

03:34.610 --> 03:35.702
KEVIN CALLED ME
INTO THE HOSPITAL,

03:35.740 --> 03:38.846
SAID HE WANTED TO FILE
A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE POLICE.

03:38.880 --> 03:42.543
HE CLAIMED THAT YOU GUYS WERE
PERSECUTING HIM, FOLLOWING HIM,

03:42.590 --> 03:44.683
FRAMING HIM FOR CRIMES
HE DIDN'T COMMIT.

03:44.720 --> 03:46.859
BUT WHEN I TOLD HIM
THAT IT WOULD TAKE A FEW WEEKS

03:46.890 --> 03:49.552
TO LOOK AT THE FACTS,
HE ATI'ACKED ME.

03:49.590 --> 03:52.024
IT TOOK TWO NURSES
TO GET HIM OFF ME.

03:52.060 --> 03:55.393
WHY DIDN'T YOU REPORT IT?

03:55.430 --> 03:57.762
I WAS AFRAID HE WAS
GOING TO COME AFTER ME.

03:57.800 --> 04:00.337
LOOK, I HAVE WORKED
WITH KEVIN FOR A WHILE,

04:00.370 --> 04:01.860
AND HE'S ALWAYS BEEN
A BIT OF A LONER.

04:01.900 --> 04:04.937
BUT THIS WAS INSANE.
WHAT DID THE HOSPITAL SAY?

04:04.970 --> 04:07.768
THEY SAID HE HAD SUFFERED
A TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY.

04:07.810 --> 04:11.803
ERRATIC BEHAVIOR, PARANOIA,
TROUBLE WITH IMPULSE CONTROL.

04:11.850 --> 04:14.341
SO HE THINKS HE'S BEING
PERSECUTED BY THE POLICE.

04:14.380 --> 04:17.019
NOW ANYONE IN PARTICULAR?
YEAH. 15 DIVISION.

04:17.050 --> 04:20.611
HE SAID HE WASN'T GONNA STOP
UNTIL IT WAS OVER.

04:20.660 --> 04:23.049
OKAY, LISTEN UP.

04:23.090 --> 04:25.957
AS MOST OF YOU KNOW,
WE BELIEVE OUR SHOOTER TO BE

04:25.990 --> 04:28.823
ONE KEVIN FORD, 42 YEARS OLD,
CAUCASIAN MALE,

04:28.860 --> 04:30.964
SUFFERING FROM
A SEVERE TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.594
FORMER SUSPECT IN
A MISSING CHILD INVESTIGATION.

04:33.640 --> 04:34.664
WE GOT OFFICERS
AT HIS WORKPLACE,

04:34.700 --> 04:36.361
AND A B.O.L.O. OUT ON HIS VAN.

04:36.410 --> 04:38.628
UNIFORMS ARE AT FORD'S HOUSE.
IT'S EMPTY. HE'S NOT THERE.

04:38.670 --> 04:40.308
ALL RIGHT. WE'LL GET OVER
AND CHECK IT OUT.

04:40.340 --> 04:42.877
HIS PARENTS ARE DECEASED.
WE NEED TO FIND HIS BROTHER.

04:42.910 --> 04:46.846
ABE FORD, 50 YEARS OLD,
673 PARKSIDE ROAD.

04:46.880 --> 04:49.815
PECK, DIAZ... BRING HIM IN.
KEEP IT FRIENDLY.

04:49.850 --> 04:50.942
WE'RE ON IT.

04:50.990 --> 04:51.740
ALL RIGHT. THE REST OF YOU,

04:51.790 --> 04:53.678
I WANT YOU OUT ON PATROL
IN PAIRS.

04:53.720 --> 04:54.789
OKAY, WE'RE LOOKING FOR
A WHITE PANEL VAN.

04:54.820 --> 04:56.287
THE PLATE NUMBER'S
ON THE HANDOUT.

04:56.330 --> 04:59.493
AND BE CAREFUL OUT THERE.
GOOD TO SEE YOU, OFFICER.
GLAD YOU'RE SAFE.

04:59.530 --> 05:02.658
NICK'S AT HER HOUSE RIGHT NOW.
ALL RIGHT.
WE'LL SEND FORENSICS OVER.

05:02.700 --> 05:04.065
SWAREK, YOU GOOD TO TAKE
HER STATEMENT?

05:04.100 --> 05:05.465
YEAH, YEAH, WE'RE GOOD.

05:07.740 --> 05:09.708
OKAY, WE HAVE
TO EXPLAIN THIS TO THEM.

05:09.740 --> 05:11.503
EXPLAIN WHAT?
THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO.

05:11.540 --> 05:12.734
THEY'RE GOING TO FIND
EVERYTHING NOW.

05:19.650 --> 05:23.381
TAKE IT EASY. ALL RIGHT?

05:23.420 --> 05:26.048
MOM WOULD KILL ME
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO YOU.
YEAH. PLEASE.

05:26.090 --> 05:27.159
SHE WOULDN'T EVEN NOTICE.

05:27.190 --> 05:30.125
(zips bag)
DON'T WORRY, DETECTIVE.
I GOT HER BACK.

05:30.160 --> 05:31.752
ALWAYS HAVE, ALWAYS WILL.

05:31.790 --> 05:32.927
GAIL.

05:32.960 --> 05:34.928
HOLLY, HEY.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.120
HI.

05:36.160 --> 05:38.060
HEY.
YOU SAID THAT ALREADY.

05:38.100 --> 05:40.091
YOU KNOW,
IT SOUNDED FAMILIAR.

05:40.140 --> 05:42.096
I JUST WANTED TO SEE YOU.

05:42.140 --> 05:44.836
YOU KNOW, TAKE TEN MINUTES,
LAY EYES ON YOU.

05:44.870 --> 05:47.100
(radio chatter)

05:47.140 --> 05:49.847
OH. OKAY, SO THAT'S
HOW WE'RE GONNA DO THIS.

05:49.880 --> 05:52.576
MM-HMM.
GAIL, WE SHOULD PROBABLY
GET GOING.

05:52.620 --> 05:55.646
JUST...
JUST BE CAREFUL, OKAY?

05:55.680 --> 05:57.716
I WILL.

06:02.730 --> 06:05.824
(indistinct conversations,
telephone ringing in distance)

06:05.860 --> 06:07.953
SO EVERYTHING IN YOUR HOUSE
IS NOW EVIDENCE.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.458
I SHOULD HAVE PACKED IT UP.
BURNED IT.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.092
I WASN'T THINKING STRAIGHT.
YOU KNOW THAT.

06:13.140 --> 06:17.736
LOOK, THE, UH,
SILVER LINING IS THAT--

06:17.770 --> 06:19.829
THAT YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT
THIS GUY THAN ANYONE ELSE.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.836
OKAY, SO LET'S START
THINKING ABOUT THAT.
(folder slides)

06:21.880 --> 06:24.747
WHAT DO YOU WE KNOW?
YOU HEARD FROM OLIVER?

06:24.780 --> 06:27.010
NO. WHY?
'CAUSE HE STILL HASN'T SHOWN UP.

06:27.050 --> 06:28.039
NICK CAN'T REACH HIM.

06:28.080 --> 06:29.684
CELERY HASN'T HEARD FROM HIM.

06:29.720 --> 06:31.039
I JUST TRIED TO CALL HIM
THREE TIMES,

06:31.090 --> 06:32.785
AND HIS CELL PHONE IS OFF.
WHAT DOES DISPATCH SAY?

06:32.820 --> 06:34.515
APPARENTLY HE'S BEEN PARKED
IN THE SAME LOCATION

06:34.560 --> 06:36.949
FOR THE LAST 45 MINUTES.
3900 LAKE SHORE.

06:36.990 --> 06:39.697
I'LL BE HERE.

06:39.730 --> 06:42.051
THIS IS 1519.
THERE'S NO CAR HERE.

06:42.100 --> 06:43.795
CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT
THE LOCATION?
(radIo static)

06:43.830 --> 06:45.889
(female dispatcher)
GPS On car 1504 still reads

06:45.930 --> 06:48.569
3900 Lake Shore.
OKAY. WELL THERE IS NO
3900 LAKE SHORE.

06:48.600 --> 06:51.706
I MEAN, IT'S AN EMPTY LOT.
ANDY.

06:51.740 --> 06:54.106
1519, we're trying
to narrow it down.
(radIo static)

06:54.140 --> 06:56.199
WE FOUND IT.
WE FOUND THE SENDER UNIT.

06:56.240 --> 06:57.946
IT'S BEEN TAKEN
OUT OF THE CAR.

06:57.980 --> 07:01.472
Sorry, go again.
You found the car?
NO, WE FOUND THE BOX.

07:01.520 --> 07:02.919
THE CAR IS MISSING.

07:02.950 --> 07:07.614
THERE'S NO SIGN
OF OFFICER SHAW.

07:07.660 --> 07:10.629
(radio chatter, siren wailing)

07:13.630 --> 07:16.667
(indistinct conversations,
camera shutter clicks)

07:16.700 --> 07:18.122
FINAL ACT PREPARATIONS.

07:18.170 --> 07:19.797
HE TURNED DOWN THE HEAT,
PAID HIS BILLS,

07:19.840 --> 07:21.091
EVEN LAID HIS SUIT OUT.

07:21.140 --> 07:22.835
THIS WAS TAPED
TO HIS COMPUTER.

07:22.870 --> 07:24.929
(camera shutter clicking)

07:24.970 --> 07:27.734
"MARLO CRUZ, SAM SWAREK,
OLIVER SHAW...

07:27.780 --> 07:31.841
ANDY, CHLOE, DOV, NICK."

07:31.880 --> 07:34.940
YEAH. IT'S A HIT LIST.

07:37.590 --> 07:42.050
(sirens wailing,
helicopter whirring)

07:42.090 --> 07:45.025
(radio chatter)

07:46.930 --> 07:48.795
LAST RADIO CONTACT WAS
39 MINUTES AGO.

07:48.830 --> 07:50.718
OLIVER SAID HE WAS
ON HIS WAY HERE.

07:50.770 --> 07:51.794
SO WHAT, HE NEVER SHOWED?

07:51.830 --> 07:53.263
HE DID. HIS UNIT LOCATOR
PINGED HIM AT THIS ADDRESS

07:53.300 --> 07:54.995
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.
IF HE'D ALREADY BEEN HERE,

07:55.040 --> 07:57.167
WHY DID HE SAY HE WAS
ON HIS WAY?
(Siren whoops)

07:57.210 --> 07:58.666
OKAY, GOT IT.
(cell phone beeps)

07:58.710 --> 08:00.803
THE GUYS JUST FOUND
FORD'S VAN AROUND THE CORNER.

08:00.840 --> 08:03.946
WHAT ABOUT OLIVER'S CELL?
THERE'S NO SIGNAL.

08:03.980 --> 08:05.709
THEY GOT TECHS
WORKING ON THE VAN,

08:05.750 --> 08:07.047
UNIFORMS ARE SEARCHING
THE PARK.

08:07.080 --> 08:09.048
FOR WHAT? A BODY?

08:09.080 --> 08:11.617
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
DETECTIVE...

08:11.650 --> 08:13.117
THERE'S SOMETHING
I THINK YOU NEED TO SEE.

08:14.990 --> 08:16.924
HEY, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
YOU TWO...

08:16.960 --> 08:17.927
LOOK,
AS SOON AS WE'RE DONE HERE,

08:17.960 --> 08:18.756
I WANT YOU BACK AT THE STATION.

08:18.790 --> 08:20.189
YOU STAY THERE
UNTIL THIS IS OVER.

08:20.230 --> 08:21.629
WHAT?
WHY?

08:21.660 --> 08:23.525
FRANK, THIS IS OLIVER.
WE NEED TO BE IN THIS.

08:23.570 --> 08:26.630
KEVIN FORD MADE A HIT LIST,
SAM, AND YOU'RE ON IT.

08:26.670 --> 08:30.128
SO IS MCNALLY, SO IS CHLOE,
WHO'S NOW IN I.C.U.

08:30.170 --> 08:32.001
SO IS OLIVER,
WHO'S NOW MISSING.

08:32.040 --> 08:33.735
SO UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE,

08:33.780 --> 08:35.077
YOU'RE BOTH STAYING
AT THE DAMN STATION.

08:35.110 --> 08:38.773
(helicopter whirring,
siren wailing)

08:42.950 --> 08:44.815
(radio chatter)

08:44.850 --> 08:45.942
WHAT IS THIS?

08:45.990 --> 08:47.912
LOOKS LIKE MARLO
WAS DOING HER RESEARCH.

08:47.960 --> 08:50.326
SHE'S GOT COPIES OF EVERY FILE
ON KEVIN FORD,

08:50.360 --> 08:53.295
EVERY INTERVIEW WITH HIM,
ABOUT HIM.

08:53.330 --> 08:54.854
IT STRETCH ES BACK ABOUT
TH REE YEARS.

08:54.900 --> 08:56.561
THERE'S EVEN A TIMELINE.

08:56.600 --> 08:58.921
WHY AREN'T THESE CONFIDENTIAL
FILES BACK AT THE STATION?

08:58.970 --> 09:01.234
(radio chatter)

09:01.270 --> 09:04.000
YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON?

09:04.040 --> 09:06.838
MARLO HAD A HUNCH.
CLEARLY SHE WAS RIGHT.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.678
EXCUSE ME?

09:09.710 --> 09:13.214
LUKE... SHE SLIPPED UP,

09:13.250 --> 09:17.584
BUT SHE'S BACK ON HER MEDS.
SHE'S--SHE'S BE'I'I'ER NOW.

09:17.620 --> 09:19.611
MEDS FOR WHAT?

09:19.660 --> 09:22.151
(siren wailing in distance)
MEDS FOR WHAT?!

09:22.190 --> 09:24.624
SHE'S BIPOLAR.

09:24.660 --> 09:27.857
SHE HAD A MANIC EPISODE--
JUST A BREAK.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.822
SO SHE ENDED UP FOCUSING
ALL OF HER ENERGY

09:29.870 --> 09:31.223
INTO KEVIN FORD
BECAUSE SHE THINKS

09:31.270 --> 09:33.329
THAT HE KILLED THE KID
TH REE YEARS AGO.

09:33.370 --> 09:34.928
YOU BOTH HAVE BEEN COVERING
FOR HER?

09:34.970 --> 09:37.734
SHE WAS RIGHT.
OKAY, SHE WAS RIGHT.

09:37.770 --> 09:39.135
LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE.
LOOK AT WHAT HE'S DOING.

09:39.170 --> 09:41.206
(laughs)
SHE WAS DEAD RIGHT
ABOUT THE GUY.

09:41.240 --> 09:44.346
YEAH. OH.

09:44.380 --> 09:45.779
BOX IT UP.
BRING IT TO THE STATION.

09:45.810 --> 09:47.778
MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING
WE CAN USE.
LUKE--

09:47.820 --> 09:49.139
I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU
ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW.

09:49.180 --> 09:51.148
WE HAVE AN (ID-[FJFICER MISSING.

09:51.190 --> 09:53.886
(siren wailing in distance)

09:53.920 --> 09:54.909
SO HOW DOES THIS WORK?

09:54.960 --> 09:56.621
WE WAIT FOR HER TO WAKE UP,
AND THEN WE DUEL?

09:56.660 --> 09:59.254
(chuckles) GUNS OR KNIVES?

09:59.290 --> 10:00.723
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT PUB TRIVIA?

10:00.760 --> 10:03.627
YOU MUST BE
MISS PRICE'S HUSBAND.

10:03.670 --> 10:06.230
CAN I HAVE A WORD?
UH, ACTUALLY,
I'M HER HUSBAND.

10:06.270 --> 10:10.138
OH, OKAY. A-AND YOU ARE?
BOYFRIEND.

10:10.170 --> 10:12.104
(P.A. tone chimes,
woman speaking indistinctly)
EVERYTHING OKAY?

10:12.140 --> 10:14.802
UNFORTUNATELY,
THE LATEST C.T. SHOWS

10:14.840 --> 10:16.876
A CLOT IN HER CAROTID ARTERY,

10:16.910 --> 10:18.878
WHERE WE REPAIRED
THE GUNSHOT WOUND.

10:18.910 --> 10:20.138
AND I THINK
WE SHOULD REMOVE IT.

10:20.180 --> 10:22.114
WE'VE GOT A WINDOW
OF OPPORTUNITY HERE,

10:22.150 --> 10:23.082
AND IF WE LEAVE IT,

10:23.120 --> 10:25.213
I'M CONCERNED THAT SHE COULD
SUFFER A STROKE,

10:25.250 --> 10:27.855
NEUROLOGICAL DAMAGE,
POSSIBLY EVEN PARALYSIS.

10:27.890 --> 10:30.154
SO... WHAT ARE WE
WAITING FOR?

10:30.190 --> 10:32.920
AS WITH EVERY PROCEDURE,
THERE ARE RISKS,

10:32.960 --> 10:34.291
AND YOU SHOULD KNOW
WHAT THEY ARE.

10:34.330 --> 10:35.228
RISKS? WHAT KIND OF RISKS?

10:35.260 --> 10:37.797
WE'LL NEED TO CLAMP OFF
THE DAMAGED ARTERY

10:37.830 --> 10:39.661
TO GET TO THE CLOT.

10:39.700 --> 10:41.895
PROBLEM IS SHE HAS SWELLING
ON THE OTHER SIDE.

10:41.940 --> 10:44.431
IF THAT SWELLING INCREASES
WHILE WE'RE OPERATING,

10:44.470 --> 10:45.937
THERE'S A POSSIBILITY

10:45.970 --> 10:47.301
THAT SHE MIGHT NOT GET
SUFFICIENT CIRCULATION,

10:47.340 --> 10:48.876
WHICH COULD LEAD TO BRAIN DEATH.

10:48.910 --> 10:52.710
HOW MUCH OF A POSSIBILITY?
I'D SAY IT'S UNLIKELY.

10:52.750 --> 10:55.878
BUT GIVEN HER CONDITION,
IT'S HARD TO QUANTIFY.

10:55.920 --> 10:57.911
WHAT ARE THE OTHER OPTIONS?

10:57.950 --> 11:02.159
WE MONITOR THE SITUATION.
TREAT HER WITH ANTICOAGULANTS,

11:02.190 --> 11:04.681
AND MAYBE THE CLOT DISSIPATES
NATURALLY.

11:04.730 --> 11:07.290
(telephone rings in distance)
IT'S A LOT TO PROCESS.

11:07.330 --> 11:08.991
DOES SHE HAVE OTHER FAMILY
YOU SHOULD TALK TO?

11:09.030 --> 11:11.328
YEAH. UM...
I'LL TRY CALLING THEM AGAIN.

11:11.370 --> 11:15.238
BUT, DOCTOR, WHAT DO YOU THINK
WE SHOULD DO?

11:15.270 --> 11:17.864
I THINK I SHOULD OPERATE.
AND SOON.

11:20.110 --> 11:22.874
(cell phone case Velcro rips,
buttons click)

11:26.820 --> 11:28.708
(refrigerator door opens)

11:28.750 --> 11:29.910
CELERY.

11:29.950 --> 11:32.214
(radio chatter)

11:32.250 --> 11:36.414
HEY. I'M JUST MAKING MYSELF
USEFUL. KEEPING BUSY.

11:36.460 --> 11:38.485
(chuckles) UM... I WAS GONNA
GO GET SOME DECENT BREAD,

11:38.530 --> 11:39.383
BUT THE GUY AT THE FRONT--

11:39.430 --> 11:41.057
I WAS GONNA GO
TO THE HEALTH FOOD STORE,

11:41.100 --> 11:42.829
AND HE WOULDN'T LET ME LEAVE.
SO I DON'T KNOW.

11:42.870 --> 11:45.259
I FIGURE OLIVER'S GOING TO BE
REALLY HUNGRY WHEN HE GETS BACK.

11:45.300 --> 11:46.892
CELERY, OLIVER IS MISSING.

11:49.170 --> 11:50.307
WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING
WE CAN TO FIND HIM.

11:50.340 --> 11:53.275
I PROMISE WE ARE GONNA
BRING HIM BACK.

11:53.310 --> 11:55.778
(sniffles and exhales)

11:55.810 --> 11:59.041
OH, GOD. OKAY.

11:59.080 --> 12:01.469
UM, WHAT CAN I DO?

12:01.520 --> 12:04.387
NOTHING. JUST SIT TIGHT.

12:04.420 --> 12:07.787
WE'RE GONNA FIND HIM.
OKAY. THANKS.

12:07.820 --> 12:09.959
I GO'I'I'A GO.

12:09.990 --> 12:12.925
(telephone rings in distance)

12:15.030 --> 12:18.067
OKAY, COLLINS, SWAREK,
MCNALLY. ..

12:18.100 --> 12:20.364
YOU WILL REMAIN AT THE STATION
UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.766
THE REST OF YOU, WE'RE LOOKING
FOR OLIVER'S SQUAD.

12:22.810 --> 12:25.904
1504.
RIGHT NOW IT'S OUR ONLY LEAD.

12:25.940 --> 12:28.500
(indistinct conversations)
DETECTIVE...

12:28.540 --> 12:33.216
WE'VE GOT KEVIN FORD'S BROTHER
IN INTERVIEW ONE.
GREAT. THANKS. NASH.

12:33.250 --> 12:34.877
CALLAGHAN, IF WE'RE GOING
TO MAKE SENSE OF THESE NOTES,

12:34.920 --> 12:36.217
WE NEED TO BRING
MARLO INTO THIS.

12:36.250 --> 12:38.548
(sighs) THAT'S UP TO YOU,
DETECTIVE.

12:38.590 --> 12:41.150
AT THIS POINT,
WHAT DOES IT MATTER?

12:41.190 --> 12:43.021
ALL RIGHT. COLLINS,

12:43.060 --> 12:45.278
DO YOU WANT TO GET MARLO
IN HERE, PLEASE?
ALL RIGHT.

12:45.330 --> 12:48.151
(sighs) WHAT?

12:48.200 --> 12:50.361
HE'S OUT THERE SOMEWHERE.

12:50.400 --> 12:52.220
AND WE CAN'T EVEN LEAVE
THE STATION.

12:52.270 --> 12:54.033
OKAY. WE DON'T NEED
TO LEAVE, ALL RIGHT?

12:54.070 --> 12:55.560
WE NEED TO USE OUR HEADS.

12:55.600 --> 12:58.307
ANDY, WE WORK TOGETHER,
WE WILL FIND HIM

12:58.340 --> 12:59.466
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE DO.

13:02.480 --> 13:06.007
HONESTLY, I-I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM
IN OVER A WEEK.

13:06.050 --> 13:07.574
IS THERE ANOTHER PLACE
THAT HE MIGHT GO--

13:07.620 --> 13:09.918
ANOTHER ADDRESS?
ANOTHER WORKSPACE?

13:09.950 --> 13:12.009
(exhales deeply)

13:12.050 --> 13:14.484
HE'S YOUR LITTLE BROTHER.
YOU KNOW HIM BETTER THAN ANYONE.

13:14.520 --> 13:18.058
PLEASE.
LOOK, I-I-I KNEW
HE WAS SPINNING OUT.

13:18.090 --> 13:19.455
I MEAN, I SAW HIM
IN THE HOSPITAL.

13:19.490 --> 13:23.460
HE WAS LOSING IT.
HE WAS LIKE A DIFFERENT PERSON.

13:23.500 --> 13:25.161
BUT...

13:25.200 --> 13:27.464
YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS HAVEN'T
EXACTLY MADE IT EASY ON HIM.

13:27.500 --> 13:30.469
ALL RIGHT? YOU'VE HAULED HIM
IN HERE OVER AND OVER AGAIN,

13:30.510 --> 13:33.434
ACCUSED HIM OF...
(voice breaking) OF--OF

13:33.480 --> 13:36.131
ABDUCTING CHILDREN--OF--
OF HURTING CHILDREN.

13:36.180 --> 13:37.442
OF COURSE HE'S UPSET.

13:37.480 --> 13:39.448
UPSET?

13:39.480 --> 13:41.573
ABE, YOUR BROTHER'S
SHOOTING POLICE OFFICERS.

13:41.620 --> 13:45.545
I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS.
I SWEAR TO GOD, I DON'T KNOW.

13:45.590 --> 13:47.217
I DON'T EVEN WANT
TO SEE HIM AGAIN.

13:47.260 --> 13:48.909
I TOLD HIM THAT
IN THE HOSPITAL.

13:48.960 --> 13:51.884
YOU TOLD HIM WHAT?
I CUT HIM OFF.

13:54.300 --> 13:56.222
I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING
TO KILL ME RIGHT THERE.

13:59.400 --> 14:03.939
(panﬁng)

14:03.970 --> 14:06.131
(bars clank)

14:06.170 --> 14:08.229
(handcuffs clank)

14:08.280 --> 14:09.941
(handcuffs rattling)

14:09.980 --> 14:13.416
(pants and wheezes)

14:13.450 --> 14:17.079
(handcuffs click)

14:17.120 --> 14:18.439
(breathy voice) KEVIN...
(exhales)

14:18.490 --> 14:20.082
(normal voice)
KEVIN, RIGHT?

14:20.120 --> 14:22.156
(clacks)

14:22.190 --> 14:24.055
(grunts, strained voice)
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS?

14:24.090 --> 14:26.581
'CAUSE ME--I'D KIND OF
LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

14:26.630 --> 14:28.495
I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED HERE.

14:28.530 --> 14:31.920
CONFUSING GETTING
HIT IN THE HEAD, HUH?

14:31.970 --> 14:35.428
EVERYTHING GOES A LITTLE...
(blows air) YOU KNOW.

14:35.470 --> 14:38.268
(exhales sharply, sniffs)
IT'S GONNA BE GOOD.

14:38.310 --> 14:41.029
OKAY. KEVIN,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:41.080 --> 14:45.073
SETTIN' THE SCENE.
SETTIN' THE TRAP.

14:45.110 --> 14:46.941
I KNOW _YOU.
(clatterIng)

14:46.980 --> 14:50.313
YOU WERE THERE
THE DAY I GOT ATTACKED.
YES. YEAH, I WAS...

14:50.350 --> 14:52.318
I ARRESTED THE GUY
THAT ASSAULTED YOU.

14:52.350 --> 14:54.318
I WAS IN YOUR HOUSE.
I CALLED E.M.S. FOR YOU.

14:54.360 --> 14:57.284
FUNNY, CONSIDERING
YOU PUT HIM UP TO IT.
WHAT?

14:57.330 --> 14:59.218
YEAH, I KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

14:59.260 --> 15:01.296
LOOK, I SAW WHAT SHE DID.
(door squeaks)

15:01.330 --> 15:03.525
THAT BITCH HAS IT OUT
FOR ME.

15:03.570 --> 15:07.267
(lock clicks)
AND YOU'RE PART OF IT.
SO, DON'T.

15:07.300 --> 15:09.268
JUST DON'T.

15:09.300 --> 15:13.930
(chuckles) OLIVER SHAW.
YOU'RE ON MY LIST.

15:13.980 --> 15:16.073
OKAY. ALL RIGHT. LIST.

15:16.110 --> 15:17.702
KEVIN, WHAT LIST
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

15:17.750 --> 15:20.719
ALREADY GOT ONE OF THEM.
(latch CIICKS)

15:20.750 --> 15:24.948
(exhales sharply, sniffs)
UH, WHAT'S HER NAME? PRICE?

15:24.990 --> 15:27.185
(pills rattling)
THE CHICKIE WITH THE--
THE BROWN HAIR.

15:27.220 --> 15:29.609
(clears throat) I ONLY WISH
I GOT BOTH OF THEM.

15:29.660 --> 15:32.185
(chuckles)
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN SWEET.

15:32.230 --> 15:35.154
UH, BUT YOU KNOW...
(pills rattle)

15:35.200 --> 15:37.623
YOU WIN SOME, LOSE SOME.
(bottle lid clicks)

15:37.670 --> 15:40.195
(exhales) I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ANYMORE.

15:40.240 --> 15:43.437
THAT OFFICER THAT YOU SHOT--
SHE'S STILL ALIVE.

15:43.470 --> 15:45.062
I SAID I DON'T WANT TO--
CHLOE PRICE IS STILL ALIVE.

15:45.110 --> 15:48.102
(shouting) I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ANYMORE!
YOU GOT A CHANCE
TO GET OUT OF THIS.

15:48.140 --> 15:49.129
YOU GOT A CHANCE!
SHUT UP!

15:49.180 --> 15:51.603
YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO--
GET UP!

15:51.650 --> 15:53.345
(punches)
AAH!

15:53.380 --> 15:55.746
(panﬁng)
(grunts)

15:55.780 --> 15:58.089
NOBODY LISTENS TO ME!

15:58.120 --> 15:59.109
(grunts)

16:02.120 --> 16:04.020
GAIL, WE'RE GONNA FIND HIM.
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE

16:04.060 --> 16:06.085
KEPT SAYING TO ME
WHEN CHRISTIAN WAS MISSING.

16:06.130 --> 16:07.495
I KNOW THEY WERE JUST TRYING
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER,

16:07.530 --> 16:10.465
BUT IT WORKED. SO, GAIL, WE'RE--
WE'RE GONNA FIND HIM.

16:10.500 --> 16:12.491
THAT'S ALL I WANT.

16:12.530 --> 16:15.067
OKAY, WE FIND OLIVER.

16:15.100 --> 16:17.534
HE MAKES A VERY DUMB JOKE.

16:17.570 --> 16:21.131
CHLOE GETS OUT OF THE HOSPITAL.
I MAKE FUN OF HER TO HER FACE.

16:21.180 --> 16:23.148
WE GO BACK TO THE PENNY.

16:23.180 --> 16:26.308
WE STIFF DOV THE BILL.
(chuckles)

16:26.350 --> 16:28.443
I MEAN, THAT'S LIFE
AS IT WAS.

16:28.480 --> 16:29.742
THAT'S LIFE
AS IT SHOULD BE.

16:29.780 --> 16:34.183
OH, MY GOD, WE'VE HAD IT
VERY, VERY EASY.

16:34.220 --> 16:36.359
I DON'T KNOW.

16:36.390 --> 16:38.483
LAST YEAR WAS PRETTY ROUGH.
HON ESTLY,

16:38.530 --> 16:40.623
THAT FEELS LIKE IT HAPPENED
TO SOMEBODY ELSE.

16:40.660 --> 16:44.494
I MEAN, I... I DON'T REALLY
FEEL ANYTHING FOR MONTHS,

16:44.530 --> 16:47.465
BUT... I GOT MEAN.

16:47.500 --> 16:49.764
MESSED THINGS UP.

16:49.800 --> 16:53.099
IT SEEMS
VERY... STUPID RIGHT NOW.

16:53.140 --> 16:55.529
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE--MAYBE
THAT'S PART OF THE POINT.

16:55.580 --> 16:58.299
PART OF THE... PLAN.

16:58.350 --> 17:01.069
THANK YOU, CONFUCIUS.

17:01.120 --> 17:02.075
I'M JUST SAYING,

17:02.120 --> 17:03.610
WHEN IT'S DARK ENOUGH,
YOU CAN SEE THE STARS.

17:03.650 --> 17:07.654
(indicator clicking,
radio chatter)

17:07.690 --> 17:10.227
TH REE YEARS AGO,
MARCUS HARTLEY WENT MISSING.

17:10.260 --> 17:12.182
KEVIN FORD WAS
THE NUMBER ONE SUSPECT.

17:12.230 --> 17:13.822
HIS ALIBI--
IT JUST DIDN'T ADD UP.

17:13.860 --> 17:16.397
THEY NEVER FOUND THE BOY--
MARLO. MARLO, RIGHT NOW
WE JUST NEED TO FIND FORD, OKAY?

17:16.430 --> 17:19.627
Y--I KNOW. I--
LOOK, YOU'VE BEEN TRACKING
THIS GUY FOR WEEKS.

17:19.670 --> 17:21.558
LET'S JUST--LET'S JUST
TALK IT THROUGH,

17:21.600 --> 17:23.238
SEE IF WE CAN
FIGURE THIS OUT, OKAY?
ALL RIGHT.

17:23.270 --> 17:26.808
OKAY, UH, THE 11th?
I MEAN, WORK. WORK.

17:26.840 --> 17:28.273
THERE WAS A DROP-OFF
AT THE STORE,

17:28.310 --> 17:29.834
AND THEN SHE WAS IN
FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT.

17:29.880 --> 17:33.475
SAME FOR THE 12th,
SAME FOR THE 13th.

17:33.520 --> 17:36.614
THE 14th IS SATURDAY.
WHY DO I KNOW THAT?

17:36.650 --> 17:39.141
WELL, THERE'S NOTHING
UNTIL 3:00 P.M. THE NEXT DAY.

17:39.190 --> 17:41.408
WELL, LET'S CHECK IT ANYWAY.
IT'S NOT GONNA HAVE ANYTHING.

17:41.460 --> 17:44.349
WHY--WHAT? WHY?
BECAUSE YOU WENT AWAY
THAT WEEKEND.

17:44.390 --> 17:47.257
REMEMBER? CHICAGO.
YOU WENT TO THAT PLACE DOWNTOWN.

17:47.300 --> 17:50.224
YOU WENT TO THE RESTAURANT WHERE
YOU GOT SERVED BY BLIND PEOPLE.

17:50.270 --> 17:53.535
(papers rustle)
RELAX.
I WASN'T SPYING ON YOU.

17:53.570 --> 17:56.266
OLIVER TOLD ME.
OH.

17:56.300 --> 17:59.508
14th--LET'S, UH,
LET'S CHECK IT, OKAY?

17:59.540 --> 18:01.405
FINE.

18:01.440 --> 18:04.102
IT'S JUST A PARKING TICKET.

18:04.150 --> 18:06.368
3550 QUEEN.

18:06.410 --> 18:08.878

18:18.190 --> 18:19.521
ALL AROUND THE SAME ADDRESS?

18:19.560 --> 18:20.857
I... I DON'T KNOW.

18:20.900 --> 18:21.958
I WOULD HAVE TAKEN THEM
OFF HIS VAN

18:22.000 --> 18:24.389
AND JUST FILED THEM BY DATE.
OKAY. QUEEN AND SHANNON.

18:24.430 --> 18:25.658

IN THE SAME INTERSECTION.

18:34.780 --> 18:35.872
(computer beeps)

18:35.910 --> 18:37.775

QUEEN AND SHANNON--

(door closes)

18:42.920 --> 18:44.649
WE USED TO LIVE AROUND THERE
WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

18:44.690 --> 18:47.386
MY DAD WORKED IN THE AREA, SO...
(sets down cell phone)

18:47.420 --> 18:48.512
WHERE DID HE WORK?

18:48.560 --> 18:52.155
HE WORKED SECURITY AT
ONE OF THE CHURCHES ON QUEEN.

18:52.190 --> 18:53.919
A ROUGH AREA BACK THEN,

18:53.960 --> 18:56.258
SO THEY NEEDED SOMEONE
IN THERE AT NIGHT.

18:56.300 --> 18:58.165
BUT THAT WAS YEARS AGO,
BEFORE, UH,

18:58.200 --> 18:59.497
BEFORE HE STARTED HIS BUSINESS.

18:59.530 --> 19:01.930
IS THERE ANY REASON YOUR BROTHER
WOULD GO BACK THERE?

19:01.970 --> 19:06.532
YEAH.

19:06.570 --> 19:08.379
YEAH, I GUESS THERE'S
ABOUT A MIlijégN REASONS--

19:08.410 --> 19:10.378
PLEASE.
(sets down cell phone)

19:10.410 --> 19:12.207
WHY WOULD HE GO BACK
TO THE CHURCH?

19:13.920 --> 19:17.412
MY DAD WASN'T, UH,
THE BEST FATHER.

19:17.450 --> 19:19.918
YOU KNOW?

19:19.950 --> 19:21.679
WASN'T A NICE MAN.

19:24.290 --> 19:26.326
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

19:26.360 --> 19:27.918
HE USED TO T--

19:27.960 --> 19:30.895
HE USED TO TAKE ONE OF US
WITH HIM... TO WORK

19:30.930 --> 19:33.364
TWO OR THREE TIMES A WEEK.

19:33.400 --> 19:35.265
UH, AND WE'D COME HOME
IN THE MORNING,

19:35.300 --> 19:38.428
AND THEN WE'D HAVE...
BREAKFAST

19:38.470 --> 19:42.509
AND EVERY TIME, IT WAS LIKE
IT DIDN'T--IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

19:42.540 --> 19:46.249
YOU KNOW, BUT... (chuckles)

19:46.280 --> 19:48.942
IT DOES. IT...

19:48.980 --> 19:50.311
IT HAPPENS.

19:52.690 --> 19:54.908
IT'S HOW YOU DEAL WITH IT
THAT--THAT--THAT MATTERS

19:54.960 --> 19:57.827
YOU KNOW, AND--AND--AND,
UH, AND SO I, YOU KNOW,

19:57.860 --> 20:00.351
I PULLED MYSELF TOGETHER.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.697
BUT KEVIN...

20:04.470 --> 20:06.267
HE FELL APART. (stammers)

20:06.300 --> 20:09.690
BY THE TIME HE WAS 14,
HE WAS DRINKING EVERY NIGHT.

20:09.740 --> 20:12.402
MM, BLACKING OUT EVERY WEEKEND.
AND--AND--AND...

20:12.440 --> 20:16.228
HE'S--HE WAS A MESS.

20:16.280 --> 20:17.941
(door buzzes and beeps,
telephone rings in distance)

20:17.980 --> 20:20.448
HEY. WE GOT OUR CONNECTION
TO THE CHURCH.

20:20.480 --> 20:22.277
IT TURNS OUT THEIR FATHER
WAS ABUSIVE TO THEM BOTH.

20:22.320 --> 20:23.912
THE CHURCH IS WHERE IT HAPPENED.

20:23.950 --> 20:26.384
WELL, LET'S GO.
LET'S CHECK IT OUT.
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANWVHERE.

20:26.420 --> 20:29.412
OKAY, WE DO THIS WITH E.T.F.
I'LL CALL BAILEY.

20:29.460 --> 20:30.722
(door buzzes)
ALL UNITS, 10-33.

20:30.760 --> 20:36.551
(table clatters
and scrapes floor)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, KEVIN?

20:36.600 --> 20:38.761
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

20:38.800 --> 20:41.030
I JUST MISSED YOU TODAY.

20:41.070 --> 20:45.439
AND YOU WERE LUCKY,
'CAUSE I'M A GOOD SHOT.

20:45.470 --> 20:47.779

20:47.810 --> 20:49.437
(table scrapes floor)

20:49.480 --> 20:51.903
WHAT IT MEANS_TO SUFFER.
(cocks rIfle)

20:54.580 --> 20:57.344
(sniffs)
MY DAD USED TO TAKE ME HERE.

20:59.020 --> 21:01.818
NIGHT AFTER NIGHT.

21:01.860 --> 21:03.725
HE SAID IT WAS GONNA BE FUN,
BUT IT WASN'T.

21:03.760 --> 21:07.059
YOU AND ME, KEV.
KEVIN?

21:07.090 --> 21:09.752
YOU AND ME.
WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER.

21:09.800 --> 21:12.860
SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH.
KEVIN?

21:12.900 --> 21:15.539
I STILL COME HERE SOMETIMES.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY.

21:15.570 --> 21:18.038
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M EVER
GOING TO MAKE SENSE OF THIS.

21:18.070 --> 21:20.732
(rifle clanks)

21:20.780 --> 21:23.977
(exhales) I THOUGHT
I'D SUFFERED ENOUGH.

21:24.010 --> 21:25.341
THEN YOU GUYS CAME ALONG.

21:25.380 --> 21:26.870
(strained voice) YEAH,
YOU'RE BEING PARANOID.

21:26.910 --> 21:28.844
(rifle clanks)

21:28.880 --> 21:30.518
(gunshot)

21:30.550 --> 21:33.678
NOBODY IS TRYING TO GET YOU!
NOBODY IS OUT TO GET YOU.

21:33.720 --> 21:37.588
I NEVER TOUCHED THAT KID!
(rail clanks)

21:37.630 --> 21:38.949
I NEVER TOUCHED HIM!

21:38.990 --> 21:43.563
PEOPLE WHO DO THAT ARE SICK.
AND H HATE THEM!

21:43.600 --> 21:45.818
AND NOW EVERYONE THINKS
I'M THE THING.

21:45.870 --> 21:48.361
I'M THE ONE THING THAT
I HATE THE MOST.

21:48.400 --> 21:51.767
EVEN MY OWN BROTHER THINKS SO.
I SEE IT IN HIS FACE.

21:51.810 --> 21:54.438
I-I BELIEVE YOU.
I BELIEVE YOU, KEVIN. I DO.

21:54.480 --> 21:58.109
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
I CAN DO TO MAKE THIS RIGHT...

21:58.150 --> 21:59.549
(female dispatcher)
All cars, 10-33.

21:59.580 --> 22:01.377

(radIo static)

22:01.420 --> 22:03.388
10-33, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

22:03.420 --> 22:04.944
10-33?

22:04.990 --> 22:07.811
IT MEANS EMERGENCY
STAND BY.

22:07.860 --> 22:10.920

I'LL BE UP THERE WAITING.

22:16.560 --> 22:18.619
YEAH.

22:18.670 --> 22:20.535

THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

22:20.570 --> 22:23.038
OKAY? E.T.F IS GONNA BE

22:23.070 --> 22:25.436
THERE ARE A LOT OF GUNS

22:25.470 --> 22:27.404
I TOLD YOU I'M A GOOD SHOT.

22:27.440 --> 22:29.931
NO, I'M SERIOUS.
I'M SERIOUS. YOU MADE YOUR LIST.

22:29.980 --> 22:32.949
I PROMISE YOU NOT ONE OF THEM

(cell phone beeps)

22:32.980 --> 22:35.540
(line rings)
THOSE OFFICERS ARE
AT THE STATION,

22:35.580 --> 22:37.047

23:12.850 --> 23:14.056

(indistinct conversations)

23:27.500 --> 23:28.592
I KNOW.

23:31.740 --> 23:34.038
I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD GO.

23:34.080 --> 23:36.105
STEVE, IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

23:36.140 --> 23:39.644
YOU KNOW, YOU STAY

23:39.680 --> 23:42.649
YOU GO IN LAST.
YOU ACT LIKE A COWARD.

23:42.680 --> 23:44.489
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

23:44.520 --> 23:45.885
COWARDICE IS
HIGHLY UNDERRATED, TRACI.

23:45.920 --> 23:46.909
THE THING IS,
YOU WOULD KNOW THAT

23:46.950 --> 23:48.884
SINCE YOU HAPPEN TO BE
THE TOUGHEST BROAD I KNOW,

23:48.920 --> 23:50.182

24:08.740 --> 24:11.470
HAVE YOU CALLED HOLLY?
EXCUSE ME?

24:11.510 --> 24:13.239
LOOK, I CALLED MY MOM,

JUST HIT THE BUTTON ON THE SIDE

24:32.600 --> 24:35.034
AND TELL 'EM THAT IT'S OVER.

24:37.240 --> 24:40.505
(radio chatter)
SNIPER ON THE SOUTH SIDE.
CAN'T SEE ANYTHING.

24:40.540 --> 24:42.235
NOTHING FROM
THE MAIN ENTRANCEWAY.

24:42.280 --> 24:43.269
NO MOVEMENT INSIDE.

24:43.310 --> 24:45.642
(radio static)
I WANT EYES
INSIDE THE BUILDING.

24:45.680 --> 24:47.238
(man) Copy that.
Heading to the south end.

24:47.280 --> 24:51.148
I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU THINK'S
GONNA ACTUALLY HAPPEN HERE?

24:51.190 --> 24:53.112
IT'S JUST YOU AND ME, MAN.
THERE IS NO E.T.F.

24:53.150 --> 24:54.856
I LIED ABOUT THAT.

24:54.890 --> 24:57.779
SORRY TO BURST YOUR BUBBLE.
I AM NOT THAT IMPORTANT A GUY.

25:00.230 --> 25:02.926
(radio chatter)

25:02.960 --> 25:04.291
(man) Okay.

25:04.330 --> 25:06.696
KEVIN, THEY'RE HERE!

25:10.040 --> 25:12.258
HE'S ALIVE.

25:12.310 --> 25:13.265
KEVIN, IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

25:13.310 --> 25:15.608
I SWEAR TO GOD,
I'LL MAKE THIS RIGHT FOR YOU.

25:15.640 --> 25:16.800
IF YOU DIDN'T DO IT...

25:16.840 --> 25:19.149
(video audio muted)

25:19.180 --> 25:22.115
(siren wailing in distance)

25:24.220 --> 25:25.710
(Oliver) YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
To PUT YOUR GUN DOWN, MAN.

25:25.750 --> 25:28.878
THIS IS YOUR ONLY CHANCE.
COME OUT, COME OUT.

25:28.920 --> 25:31.252
IT ISN'T WORTH IT, MY FRIEND,
I SWEAR.

25:31.290 --> 25:33.178
YOU CAN WORK THIS OUT.
YOU CAN FIGURE IT OUT...

25:33.230 --> 25:35.994
(siren wailing in distance)

25:36.030 --> 25:37.099
(radio static)
(man) Southwest door
barricaded shut.

25:37.130 --> 25:38.722
Looks like some kind
of pressure switch, pipe bomb.

25:38.770 --> 25:40.021
(radio static)

25:40.070 --> 25:42.061
(man) Same thing on our side.
No entry at the southeast door.

25:42.100 --> 25:44.068
Only clear entrwNay
is north door.

25:44.110 --> 25:46.260
THEN WE GO THROUGH
THE FRONT.

25:46.310 --> 25:49.871
ALPHA, BRAVO, MOVE TO NORTH SIDE
FOR IMMEDIATE ENTRY.

25:49.910 --> 25:51.707
(radio static)
Roger that.

26:05.860 --> 26:06.827
Taking the west staircase.

26:06.860 --> 26:07.895
Roger that.
Taking the east.

26:11.770 --> 26:14.762
NO, NO! GO BACK! GO BACK!
THERE'S A GUN!

26:14.800 --> 26:16.165

26:22.310 --> 26:24.778
CENTER'S CLEAR.

26:24.810 --> 26:27.244

26:27.280 --> 26:29.840
WE'RE CLEAR!
GOING IN THREE.

26:29.880 --> 26:31.040
(clacking)
(grunts)

26:33.050 --> 26:34.950
HEY, HEY!

26:34.990 --> 26:38.084
(groaning)

26:38.130 --> 26:40.792
FRANKIE?
GOOD TO SEE YOU, BROTHER.

26:40.830 --> 26:41.797
YEAH, YOU SHOULD LISTEN.
GET HIM OUTTA HERE.

26:41.830 --> 26:42.649
GUY WAS RIGHT UP THERE.

26:42.700 --> 26:43.724
I THOUGHT HE WAS
GONNA START SHOOTING.

26:43.770 --> 26:45.692
HE WAS UP ON THE BALCONY.
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.

26:45.730 --> 26:49.359
(radio chatter)

26:49.400 --> 26:52.130
(man speaks indistinctly)

26:59.180 --> 27:00.169
I COULDN'T GET AHOLD
OF HER PARENTS,

27:00.210 --> 27:01.711
BUT I CALLED MY DAD.
HE'S A DOCTOR,

27:01.750 --> 27:03.843
SO, YOU KNOW, I FIGURED
WE'D GET A SECOND OPINION.

27:03.890 --> 27:05.812
I-I EXPLAINED EVERYTHING
TO HIM,

27:05.850 --> 27:09.217
AND HE THINKS THAT SURGERY
IS DEFINITELY HER BEST OPTION.

27:09.260 --> 27:11.251
(scoffs)

27:11.290 --> 27:13.690
I CAN'T LET THEM CUT HER OPEN
AGAIN, MAN. NOT NOW.

27:13.730 --> 27:15.288
I KNOW, BUT IF WE DON'T
DO THIS OPERATION,

27:15.330 --> 27:17.252
SHE COULD BE PARALYZED
OR WORSE.

27:17.300 --> 27:19.029
THAT COULD HAPPEN
IF THEY DO OPERATE.

27:19.070 --> 27:21.288
BUT THE DOCTOR SAID
IT'S FAR LESS LIKELY.

27:21.340 --> 27:23.399
SHE ALSO SAID
CHLOE COULD HEAL ON HER OWN.

27:23.440 --> 27:24.429
SO WHAT,
YOU WANNA JUST DO NOTHING?

27:24.470 --> 27:26.404
YOU WANNA JUST GAMBLE
THAT SHE'S GONNA BE OKAY?

27:26.440 --> 27:29.329
LOOK, I DON'T NEED
YOUR PERMISSION HERE.

27:29.380 --> 27:32.872
I'M HER HUSBAND. I HAVE
THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE THIS CALL.

27:32.910 --> 27:35.947
SO THAT'S IT?

27:35.980 --> 27:37.743
THIS IS WHAT SHE'D WANT.

27:37.790 --> 27:38.916
AND IF YOU KNEW HER
AS WELL AS YOU THINK YOU DO,

27:38.950 --> 27:40.144
YOU'D KNOW THAT.

27:40.190 --> 27:41.919
I'M GETTING THE DOCTOR.

27:41.960 --> 27:44.929
SHE NEEDS TO HAVE
THIS OPERATION.

27:44.960 --> 27:46.427
DOV.

27:46.460 --> 27:47.529
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

27:51.470 --> 27:54.030
OLIVER'S OKAY. THEY FOUND HIM.
HE WAS AT THE CHURCH.

27:54.070 --> 27:55.890
WHERE'S FORD?
DID THEY BRING HIM IN?

27:55.940 --> 27:57.293
THEY DIDN'T FIND FORD.

27:57.340 --> 27:59.103
WHAT?
HE WASN'T AT THE CHURCH.

27:59.140 --> 28:01.028
I DON'T KNOW. WE GOT
OFFICERS AT HIS HOUSE,

28:01.080 --> 28:03.207
AT THE WAREHOUSE,
AT HIS BROTHER'S CABIN.

28:03.240 --> 28:04.377
HE'S NOT GONNA GO THERE.

28:04.410 --> 28:05.946
HE USED IT AS HIS ALIBI
LAST TIME,

28:05.980 --> 28:06.969
AND IT DIDN'T ADD UP THEN.

28:07.010 --> 28:08.079
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

28:08.120 --> 28:10.270
HIS BROTHER SAID THAT THEY
SPENT THE WEEKEND TOGETHER.

28:10.320 --> 28:12.345
BUT THERE'S NO EVIDENCE
OF IT.

28:12.390 --> 28:15.416
OKAY? I HAVE
A WITNESS STATEMENT...

28:15.460 --> 28:18.020
THAT SAYS, "NO,
I DID NOT SEE KEVIN'S VAN.

28:18.060 --> 28:20.324
IN FACT, I DIDN'T SEE
ANY VEHICLES AT ALL.

28:20.360 --> 28:22.021
MAYBE NEITHER ONE OF THEM
WAS THERE.

28:22.060 --> 28:25.063
WELL, ABE SAID THAT THEY WERE,
SO WHY WOULD HE LIE ABOUT THAT?

28:25.100 --> 28:26.829
I DON'T KNOW.

28:26.870 --> 28:28.269
(radio chatter)

28:28.300 --> 28:31.007
MAKE AN ALIBI
FOR HIS BROTHER?

28:31.040 --> 28:33.361
(door buzzes in distance)

28:44.350 --> 28:46.818
WHAT IF I WAS WRONG?

28:46.850 --> 28:48.078
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

28:48.120 --> 28:52.955
THIS WHOLE TIME, WHAT IF I WAS
LOOKING AT THE WRONG BROTHER?

28:52.990 --> 28:54.924
(gun clicks)

28:54.960 --> 28:56.097
HEY.

28:56.130 --> 28:57.290
HEY.

28:57.330 --> 28:58.422
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

28:58.470 --> 28:59.892
GOING HOME.

28:59.930 --> 29:01.989
THE GUY'S STILL OUT THERE.

29:02.040 --> 29:05.430
(chuckles) YEAH. I KNOW.

29:05.470 --> 29:06.505
YOU SHOULD STAY HERE.

29:06.540 --> 29:09.100
FRANK'S RIGHT.

29:09.140 --> 29:10.107
BEST PLACE FOR YOU.

29:10.140 --> 29:12.142
OH. BUT NOT YOU,
RIGHT?

29:12.180 --> 29:15.843
YOU'RE GOOD.
YOU'RE BULLETPROOF.

29:15.880 --> 29:16.847
NO.

29:16.880 --> 29:17.915
SAM, YOU CAN'T JUST LEAVE.

29:17.950 --> 29:19.508
YEAH, I CAN, ACTUALLY.

29:19.550 --> 29:22.053
IT'S THE ONLY THING
I CAN DO.

29:22.090 --> 29:24.024
THE ONLY GOOD THING.

29:24.060 --> 29:27.223
HEY. HEY! WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
THE ONLY GOOD THING YOU CAN DO?

29:27.260 --> 29:28.352
HOW'S IT A GOOD THING
TO LEAVE?

29:28.400 --> 29:30.356
EVERYBODY'S FINE.
OLIVER'S OKAY.

29:30.400 --> 29:32.322
RIGHT. SO STAY.
I CAN'T.

29:32.370 --> 29:34.429
I CAN'T. (sighs)

29:34.470 --> 29:36.335
(man speaks indistinctly)

29:36.370 --> 29:40.204
I CAN'T BE HERE ANYMORE...
WITH YOU.

29:40.240 --> 29:42.105
I... I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

29:42.140 --> 29:44.449
I SCREWED IT UP.
IT'S MY FAULT.

29:44.480 --> 29:47.347
I SCREWED IT UP
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

29:47.380 --> 29:50.144
ANDY, I WANT YOU
TO BE HAPPY,

29:50.180 --> 29:51.442
MORE THAN ANYTHING
IN THE WORLD,

29:51.490 --> 29:54.550
MORE THAN ANYTHING
I COULD EVER WANT FOR MYSELF.

29:54.590 --> 29:56.808
AND YOU ARE--WITH HIM.

29:56.860 --> 30:00.079
AND THAT MEANS, UH...

30:02.000 --> 30:03.149
I GOTTA GO.

30:07.130 --> 30:09.462
SAM. HEY.

30:11.510 --> 30:12.568
SAM.

30:12.610 --> 30:14.237
(horn honks in distance)

30:14.280 --> 30:15.531
SAM.

30:15.580 --> 30:18.242
1504--THIS IS OLIVER'S SQUAD.

30:18.280 --> 30:20.168
WHY IS IT HERE?

30:23.480 --> 30:24.811
(clicks)

30:28.260 --> 30:29.989
(beeps)

30:30.020 --> 30:32.853
(indistinct conversations)
(Frank) YEAH? WHAT'S GOING ON?

30:32.890 --> 30:34.152
MCNALLY AND I
ARE IN THE PARKING LOT.

30:34.200 --> 30:35.997
WE GOT OLIVER'S CRUISER.
Swarek...

30:36.030 --> 30:37.429
I TOLD YOU TO STAY
IN THE STATION.

30:37.460 --> 30:38.563
YEAH, I KNOW.

30:38.600 --> 30:40.989
LISTEN,
EVERYONE ON THE LIST IS HERE,

30:41.040 --> 30:43.497
AND NOW OLIVER'S CAR
IS PARKED OUTSIDE.

30:43.540 --> 30:46.464
WAIT, WAIT. THAT CAN'T BE.
WE HAVE NOT RECOVERED HIS SQUAD.

30:46.510 --> 30:48.535
I THINK HE'S HERE.
THIS WHOLE THING IS A DIVERSION.

30:48.580 --> 30:50.901
I THINK KEVIN FORD
IS IN THE STATION.

30:50.950 --> 30:52.349
SWAREK. SWAREK!

30:52.380 --> 30:54.109
(door buzzes and beeps)

30:54.150 --> 30:56.038
WHAT'S GOING ON?

30:56.080 --> 30:56.910
(lowered voice)
WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE

30:56.950 --> 30:58.508
KEVIN FORD IS IN THE BUILDING,
ARMED.

30:58.550 --> 31:00.347
YOU NEED TO SECURE THIS AREA.

31:00.390 --> 31:01.618
I'VE GOT FOUR BODIES
IN CELLS.

31:01.660 --> 31:03.309
HE'S NOT AFTER THEM.
HE'S AFTER US.

31:03.360 --> 31:05.157
LOCK THE DOORS AND DON'T LET
ANYONE IN YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE.

31:05.190 --> 31:07.351
FORD MIGHT BE WEARING
A POLICE UNIFORM.

31:07.390 --> 31:08.527
I'LL START CLEARING
FROM HERE,

31:08.560 --> 31:10.323
THEN I'M GETTING MY GUN.
YOU STAY PUT.

31:10.360 --> 31:13.193
I'M GONNA CLEAR THE SQUAD ROOM,
AND I'LL MEET YOU IN THE MIDDLE.

31:13.230 --> 31:16.199
(radio chatter)

31:30.320 --> 31:32.140
(turns knob)

31:33.620 --> 31:36.589
(radio chatter continues)

32:23.600 --> 32:25.204
(telephone rings)

32:25.240 --> 32:28.073
(indistinct conversations,
radio chatter)

32:33.550 --> 32:35.040
CELERY.

32:35.080 --> 32:37.219
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I'M ON MY WAY TO THE HOSPITAL.

32:37.250 --> 32:38.512
IS OLIVER OKAY?
OLIVER'S FINE.

32:38.550 --> 32:39.744
I THINK KEVIN FORD
IS IN THE BUILDING,

32:39.790 --> 32:40.745
DRESSED AS A POLICE OFFICER.

32:40.790 --> 32:43.611
COME WITH ME. LOCK IT DOWN.
STAY OFF THE RADIO.

32:43.660 --> 32:44.729
RIGHT. I GOT IT.

32:44.760 --> 32:46.421
WHAT IS YOUR NAME?

32:46.460 --> 32:48.098
WENDY.
OKAY, WENDY, COME WITH ME.

32:48.130 --> 32:49.154
IN HERE, PLEASE.

32:49.200 --> 32:50.758
WH-WHAT'S HAPPENING?

32:50.800 --> 32:51.869
STAY HERE.
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

32:51.900 --> 32:54.130
DO NOT OPEN THE DOOR
UNLESS YOU RECOGNIZE THE VOICE

32:54.170 --> 32:55.569
ON THE OTHER SIDE.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

32:55.600 --> 32:57.966
(radio chatter)

33:01.810 --> 33:03.107
(unholsters gun)

33:05.610 --> 33:07.339
SAY KEVIN HAS
A WEEKEND BLACKOUT.

33:07.380 --> 33:08.415
HE DOESN'T HAVE
A SOLID ALIBI

33:08.450 --> 33:09.542
WHEN THE POLICE COME ASKING
ABOUT THE HARTLEY BOY,

33:09.580 --> 33:13.141
SO ABE OFFERS TO HELP.

33:13.190 --> 33:15.658
BUILDS HIMSELF AN ALIBI
IN THE PROCESS.

33:15.690 --> 33:18.352
AND HE PINS IT ALL
ON HIS LITTLE BROTHER.

33:18.390 --> 33:20.085
ABE'S STILL
IN THE STATION, RIGHT?

33:20.130 --> 33:22.519
I THINK SO.

33:27.530 --> 33:28.758
(vibrating)

33:33.770 --> 33:35.772
COLLINS.

33:35.810 --> 33:38.040
FORD! NO!

33:42.120 --> 33:44.088
(Officers shouting at once)

33:44.120 --> 33:45.348
SAM !

33:45.390 --> 33:46.743
(door buzzes and beeps)

33:46.790 --> 33:49.554
(shouting continues,
radio chatter)

33:49.590 --> 33:50.352
YOU GOTTA
KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN.

33:50.390 --> 33:52.119
STAY DOWN, STAY DOWN.
NO, NO, NO.

33:52.160 --> 33:53.184
SAM, YOU GOTTA STAY DOWN,
OKAY?

33:53.230 --> 33:55.198
(indistinct Shouting continues)

33:55.230 --> 33:58.097
WE GOT HIM.

33:58.130 --> 33:59.825
WE DID.

33:59.870 --> 34:01.360
TOLD YOU WE WOULD.

34:01.400 --> 34:03.493
I MEAN, I DIDN'T MEAN
I TOLD YOU SO, BUT...

34:03.540 --> 34:05.098
(panﬁng)
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEANT.

34:05.140 --> 34:06.266
I GOTTA GET UP.

34:06.310 --> 34:07.504
SAM, NO,
YOU GOTTA STAY DOWN, PLEASE.
I GOTTA GET UP.

34:07.540 --> 34:09.428
SAM, PLEASE,
YOU GOTTA RELAX, OKAY?

34:09.480 --> 34:10.799
JUST STAY DOWN.
IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

34:13.210 --> 34:15.815
(indistinct Shouting)

34:15.850 --> 34:18.080
MOVE. OFFICER,
YOU GOTTA MOVE BACK.

34:18.120 --> 34:20.088
NO, I'M GOING.

34:22.620 --> 34:24.781
(gurney wheels clack)

34:24.830 --> 34:27.390
(siren wailing)

34:27.430 --> 34:31.366
(indistinct conversations)

34:31.400 --> 34:34.198
(siren continues wailing)

34:34.240 --> 34:38.267
(ventilator whooshing)

34:38.310 --> 34:40.733
C.T.A.S. 1.
WE HAVE A 35-YEAR-OLD MALE.

34:40.770 --> 34:42.874
P.O., G.S.W. TO THE CHEST.

34:42.910 --> 34:44.138
G.C.S.'s A 9.

34:44.180 --> 34:45.147
SAM?
FIVE MINUTES OUT.

34:45.180 --> 34:46.807
I'M RIGHT HERE.

34:46.850 --> 34:49.842
(strained voice) OKAY.

34:49.880 --> 34:53.247
I'M JUST GONNA...
TALK OR SOMETHING

34:53.290 --> 34:54.552
UNTIL WE GET THERE,
'CAUSE I DON'T REALLY KNOW

34:54.590 --> 34:56.512
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

34:56.560 --> 34:57.458
OKAY.
SO...

34:57.490 --> 35:01.824
OKAY, BUT NOT YOU.
OKAY? SAVE EVERY BREATH.

35:01.860 --> 35:03.657
GOOD PLAN.

35:03.700 --> 35:05.895
IT IS, ACTUALLY.

35:05.930 --> 35:07.488
IT'S AN EXCELLENT PLAN.

35:07.530 --> 35:10.636
YOU'RE GONNA LIE THERE,
AND YOU'RE GONNA LISTEN TO ME.

35:10.670 --> 35:14.276
I'M GONNA TELL YOU
A STORY.

35:14.310 --> 35:16.505
IT WAS JUST, YOU KNOW,
A NORMAL NIGHT,

35:16.540 --> 35:20.772
AND WE WERE LYING IN BED.
AND...

35:20.810 --> 35:22.744
MY STOMACH WAS HURTING
FROM LAUGHING

35:22.780 --> 35:24.919
'CAUSE YOU WERE TEASING ME
ABOUT SOMETHING.

35:24.950 --> 35:26.918
I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT.

35:26.950 --> 35:29.384
I MUST HAVE FALLEN ASLEEP
OR SOMETHING,

35:29.420 --> 35:34.289
BECAUSE... ALL OF A SUDDEN
I WAS HAVING THIS--

35:34.330 --> 35:36.298
THIS REALLY TERRIBLE DREAM.

35:37.900 --> 35:39.663
AND I COULDN'T STOP CRYING.

35:39.700 --> 35:41.565
YOU KNOW,
I WAS CRYING AND...

35:44.940 --> 35:47.431
YOU WEREN'T EVEN
REALLY AWAKE.

35:50.510 --> 35:53.445
I REMEMBER YOU--
YOU GRABBED ME.

35:53.480 --> 35:54.777
I REMEMBER...

35:54.820 --> 35:56.549
YOU WERE JUST HOLDING ME
SO TIGHT,

35:56.580 --> 35:58.514
ALL OF A SUDDEN,

35:58.550 --> 36:02.384
YOU SAID,
"I'M RIGHT HERE.

36:02.420 --> 36:05.184
I'M GONNA HOLD ON TO YOU,
AND I'M NEVER GONNA LET YOU GO."

36:05.230 --> 36:08.893
RIGHT THEN...

36:08.930 --> 36:12.718
I KNEW THAT I WOULD NEVER
FEEL MORE LOVED...

36:15.440 --> 36:17.897
(voice breaks)
OR MORE KNOWN.

36:17.940 --> 36:19.703
LOOK, I KNOW IT'S SMALL.

36:19.740 --> 36:21.230
I KNOW
IT'S A REALLY SMALL MOMENT.

36:21.280 --> 36:24.306
IT'S... IT'S NOT
EVEN A GOOD STORY.

36:24.350 --> 36:26.568
THAT WAS
A PRETTY GOOD STORY.

36:26.610 --> 36:29.613
I LOVE YOU.

36:29.650 --> 36:31.174
I LOVE YOU.

36:33.020 --> 36:35.750
YOU'RE MY STORY.

36:35.790 --> 36:37.417
SAM...

36:37.460 --> 36:38.688
YOU.

36:38.730 --> 36:42.393
(swallows)

36:48.030 --> 36:50.567
OFFICER, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO MOVE BACK.

36:50.600 --> 36:54.809
(siren wailing in distance)

37:10.520 --> 37:12.829
(monitor beeping steadily)

37:16.030 --> 37:17.452
SO?

37:17.500 --> 37:19.821
HE WON'T CONSENT
TO THE PROCEDURE.

37:19.870 --> 37:21.667
OKAY, BUT MAYBE IF WE
TALK TO HIM TOGETHER...

37:21.700 --> 37:23.031
NO, YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE.

37:23.070 --> 37:24.264
WHAT?

37:24.310 --> 37:25.834
HE'S MADE HIS WISHES CLEAR,

37:25.870 --> 37:28.907
AND NOW HE'S ASKED TO BE
ALONE WITH HIS WIFE.

37:28.940 --> 37:30.009
I'M SORRY.

37:31.850 --> 37:34.819
(Matt Walters'
"I Would Die For You" playing)

37:53.600 --> 37:54.862
(door buzzes and beeps)

37:56.340 --> 37:57.898
ANY NEWS?

37:57.940 --> 37:59.737
YEAH. THEY'RE MOVING HIM
INTO SURGERY.

37:59.770 --> 38:03.069
* HE BURIED HER HEART STILL

38:03.110 --> 38:05.544
LOOK, MARLO. ..

38:05.580 --> 38:09.676
EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED
HERE WITH YOU...

38:09.720 --> 38:10.948
WE NEED TO DEAL WITH IT.

38:10.980 --> 38:13.380
YEAH.

38:13.420 --> 38:14.580
I GOT IT.

38:14.620 --> 38:16.349
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO PACK YOUR THINGS.

38:16.390 --> 38:17.687
GO HOME.

38:17.720 --> 38:19.756
MM-HMM.

38:19.790 --> 38:20.757
TAKE YOUR TIME.

38:20.790 --> 38:22.826
* IN THE RAINED-ON RIVERBED

38:22.860 --> 38:24.464
(door buzzes and beeps)

38:28.540 --> 38:30.690
IS HE ALIVE?

38:30.740 --> 38:31.832
NO.

38:31.870 --> 38:33.929
NO, HE'S NOT.

38:33.970 --> 38:37.076
LOOK, ABE, I'M GONNA...
HAVE TO ASK YOU

38:37.110 --> 38:39.943
