00:15.080 --> 00:16.640
Good morning, Edwina.

00:16.720 --> 00:19.280
Reverend. Mrs Dawson.

00:19.360 --> 00:20.840
Sorry we're late.

00:20.920 --> 00:22.840
Had a bit of an incident
at the orphanage this morning.

00:22.920 --> 00:24.880
Those kids will
be the death of me.

00:24.960 --> 00:25.920
(CHUCKLES)

00:31.960 --> 00:33.760
(ENGINE RUMBLING)

00:37.800 --> 00:39.400
You're keen, Officer Myers.

00:39.480 --> 00:41.840
I'm afraid polling doesn't
start for another 20 minutes.

00:41.920 --> 00:45.880
(SIGHS) Actually, I'm here in
my official capacity,
Reverend.

00:45.960 --> 00:49.160
The Commissioner
wanted a presence,
as he calls it.

00:49.240 --> 00:51.240
For when
the candidates show up.

00:51.320 --> 00:52.560
Trying to
impress the new mayor

00:52.640 --> 00:53.840
even before
they've been elected.

00:53.920 --> 00:55.800
(CHUCKLES)
You might think that.

00:55.880 --> 00:56.840
I couldn't comment.

01:01.360 --> 01:02.760
EDWINA:
Yes those are the right ones.

01:03.880 --> 01:06.280
The sign needs putting out.

01:06.360 --> 01:08.160
I'll do that, then.
Thank you, Edwina.

01:25.880 --> 01:27.880
(CAMERA CLICKS)

01:27.960 --> 01:29.840
PETER: I think my
policies are clear.

01:29.920 --> 01:32.280
And I'd like to
think that the people
of Saint Marie feel the same

01:32.360 --> 01:33.640
and show their
support accordingly.

01:35.280 --> 01:36.880
Morning, Dwayne.

01:36.960 --> 01:38.680
Oh, morning, Catherine.

01:38.760 --> 01:40.880
I hope I can count
on your vote today.

01:40.960 --> 01:43.160
My vote? Well?

01:43.240 --> 01:46.160
Of course, I mean, who else
would I vote for?

01:47.320 --> 01:49.160
All the best for today.

01:49.240 --> 01:50.880
The same to you, Peter.

01:50.960 --> 01:52.480
Whichever way it goes,

01:52.560 --> 01:54.040
I'd like to think that you
and I could work together.

01:54.120 --> 01:55.080
I'd like that.

01:58.720 --> 02:00.360
Just as long as
one of us beats him.

02:04.280 --> 02:07.280
OK, Dad. The journalist's
name is Samantha Palmer.

02:07.360 --> 02:08.800
You donated money
to her son's school

02:08.880 --> 02:10.280
to help build
a new sports hub.

02:10.360 --> 02:11.840
-The boy's name?
-Marvin.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.600
Samantha.

02:14.680 --> 02:16.320
So good to see you.

02:16.400 --> 02:17.760
VICTOR: How's young Marvin?

02:17.840 --> 02:19.240
SAMANTHA:
He's doing well thank you.

02:19.320 --> 02:21.320
This fan is broken.

02:21.400 --> 02:23.360
I think there's a spare in
the storeroom.

02:23.440 --> 02:24.800
The candidates are coming in.

02:24.880 --> 02:26.640
I'm going to get another fan.

02:26.720 --> 02:29.760
I can't be expected
to sit in this heat
without a fan.

02:31.160 --> 02:32.120
(SIGHS)

02:35.880 --> 02:37.160
Morning.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.040
Residents of
the Honore District Council

02:39.120 --> 02:40.880
should register
at Reverend Dawson's desk.

02:40.960 --> 02:42.560
And those from
the Port Royal district

02:42.640 --> 02:43.800
should register with me.

02:45.720 --> 02:47.000
Judith, where's the fan?

02:47.080 --> 02:49.480
Victor Pearce,
14 rue des Tyrans.

EDWINA: Where is the fan?

03:08.080 --> 03:10.680
JUDITH:
Right, I'm coming over,
we'll find it.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.560
The fan is on the top shelf.

03:18.280 --> 03:20.280
Excuse me?
There's no pen in this booth.

03:20.880 --> 03:22.400
Sorry.

03:22.480 --> 03:23.960
JUDITH:
Right in front of your eyes,
right there.

03:26.120 --> 03:27.080
Sorry.

04:41.840 --> 04:43.560
How is your lemonade,
Inspector?

04:44.600 --> 04:45.560
Lovely.

04:46.680 --> 04:47.920
Very lemony.

04:50.120 --> 04:52.680
I like it, love it.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.360
I had a phone call from your

04:54.440 --> 04:56.440
supervising
officer back in the UK.

04:56.520 --> 04:58.680
It's not about the expenses?
I...

04:58.760 --> 04:59.840
He didn't mention them.

05:00.520 --> 05:01.600
That's a relief.

05:01.680 --> 05:02.960
It seems London

05:03.040 --> 05:05.720
aren't willing to be quite
as flexible...

05:05.800 --> 05:07.520
About our arrangement as
we first thought.

05:08.560 --> 05:09.520
I see.

05:13.040 --> 05:15.440
Actually I'm not
sure that I do see.

05:15.520 --> 05:19.040
(SIGHS) Am I to go back,
or stay, or...

05:19.120 --> 05:22.800
The decision lies entirely
with you, Inspector.

05:22.880 --> 05:25.680
Well, it's very tempting,
I have to admit.

-But the thing is...

We've cleared the scene, sir.

05:48.880 --> 05:50.240
The witnesses
are waiting for us

05:50.320 --> 05:52.120
in the church
when you're ready.

05:52.200 --> 05:53.480
So, the Commissioner
was telling me,

05:53.560 --> 05:55.600
our victim is Victor Pearce.

05:55.680 --> 05:57.440
Local businessman,
who is standing for mayor.

05:57.520 --> 05:58.960
-Is that right?
-Yes sir.

05:59.040 --> 06:00.360
He and the other candidates

06:00.440 --> 06:02.200
were casting their votes
when it happened.

06:02.280 --> 06:03.480
Just after 10:00 a.m.

06:03.560 --> 06:05.440
I was on duty
outside the main door.

06:05.520 --> 06:08.320
I thought our presence
will be appropriate.

06:08.400 --> 06:09.960
And Catherine was here
as well, I take it?

06:10.040 --> 06:11.280
Her being a candidate.

06:11.360 --> 06:13.640
It was Catherine
who raised the alarm.

06:13.720 --> 06:17.280
Oh, looks like a 20-centimetre
blade at a guess.

06:17.360 --> 06:18.320
Kitchen knife, maybe?

06:19.200 --> 06:20.520
Any fingerprints, JP?

06:20.600 --> 06:22.280
There's some partials,
I think.

06:22.360 --> 06:23.440
But it's hard to make out.

06:23.520 --> 06:24.760
I'll get it out
to the lab, sir.

06:43.120 --> 06:44.360
Those two desks?

06:44.440 --> 06:46.080
Port Royal and Honore?

06:46.160 --> 06:48.480
You collect your
ballot depending
on which area you live in?

06:48.560 --> 06:51.160
That's right, sir. Our victim
was an Honore resident.

06:52.920 --> 06:55.880
So, he got his ballot here.

06:55.960 --> 06:58.480
Then walked back
over to the booth...

07:00.000 --> 07:00.960
Here.

07:01.800 --> 07:03.240
To cast his vote.

07:04.440 --> 07:05.880
Witnesses?

07:05.960 --> 07:07.920
Six other people were in here
when it happened.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.520
No one saw a thing.

07:09.600 --> 07:10.960
That's not possible, is it?

07:11.040 --> 07:13.240
Everyone was sure about
where they were.

07:13.320 --> 07:15.680
No one was near
the victim's booth.

07:15.760 --> 07:17.880
They think an intruder
must have got in.

07:17.960 --> 07:20.800
-From where?
-No one passed me.

07:20.880 --> 07:22.520
-The windows?
-All locked.

07:22.600 --> 07:23.680
I checked.

07:25.440 --> 07:26.960
Well what about
that fire-escape?

07:27.040 --> 07:28.440
Can that be opened
from the outside?

07:42.200 --> 07:43.160
(DOOR SQUEAKING)

07:44.600 --> 07:47.080
No, it only opens one way.

07:47.160 --> 07:48.480
Makes sense, I suppose.

07:48.560 --> 07:51.280
Who'd want to run into
a burning building?

07:51.360 --> 07:55.040
So, if nobody else came in
and nobody left,

07:55.120 --> 07:57.600
our culprit must be one
of the six people...

07:57.680 --> 07:59.120
Who were already in here.

08:01.680 --> 08:03.560
JACK:
Now, this is simply routine.

08:03.640 --> 08:05.640
Nothing at all for
you to worry about.

08:05.720 --> 08:07.040
But if I could just ask...

08:07.120 --> 08:08.600
If you could remember
your exact position

08:08.680 --> 08:10.440
in the Community Centre

08:10.520 --> 08:12.400
when Catherine
here raised the alarm.

08:14.320 --> 08:17.280
Well I was in
one of the booths,
casting my vote.

08:17.360 --> 08:19.360
Kemar was in
the one next to me.

08:19.440 --> 08:21.360
The partitions in the booths
are from the waist up

08:21.440 --> 08:24.360
so you can see if someone's in
the booth next to you.

08:24.440 --> 08:26.640
CATHERINE: I was in the booth
next to Victor.

08:26.720 --> 08:28.480
I heard the noise first.

08:28.560 --> 08:31.400
Victor breathing in
like he was in pain.

08:31.480 --> 08:33.160
And I noticed
blood on the floor.

08:33.240 --> 08:35.800
So I went to check
if he was OK and...

08:37.360 --> 08:38.880
And what about
the rest of you?

08:40.960 --> 08:42.320
Edwina?

08:42.400 --> 08:45.720
Ms Bousquet,
if you don't mind, Inspector.

08:45.800 --> 08:47.640
My apologies, Ms Bousquet.

08:47.720 --> 08:49.200
Forgive my impertinence.

08:49.280 --> 08:50.520
But do you mind me asking,

08:50.600 --> 08:52.280
where were you when
this was going on?

08:52.360 --> 08:53.520
I was in the storeroom.

08:54.920 --> 08:57.040
Trying to find a fan
that wasn't broken.

08:57.800 --> 08:58.960
Judith?

08:59.040 --> 09:01.200
I can't find the fan.

09:01.280 --> 09:03.720
She was struggling,
so I went to go and help her.

09:03.800 --> 09:06.880
Edwina, the fan is
in the other cupboard
right in front of you.

09:06.960 --> 09:08.880
Then we heard a commotion
and went over to find

09:08.960 --> 09:11.000
that Mr Pearce had been...

09:11.080 --> 09:12.040
REVEREND DAWSON: Oh, my God!

09:13.320 --> 09:15.200
JACK: OK. Thank you.

09:15.280 --> 09:17.920
So, I have Mr Pearce

09:18.000 --> 09:20.200
and the three of you in
the polling booths.

09:20.280 --> 09:22.880
And you two ladies
were in the storeroom.

09:22.960 --> 09:24.040
Which leaves us...

09:24.800 --> 09:25.960
Reverend...

09:26.040 --> 09:27.040
Dawson?

09:27.120 --> 09:28.080
I didn't leave my desk.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.800
Actually,
that's not strictly true.

09:31.880 --> 09:33.760
Victor's booth
didn't have a pen in it.

09:33.840 --> 09:36.200
He asked me for one so I went
and handed it to him.

09:37.160 --> 09:38.640
Right.

09:38.720 --> 09:40.720
Did all the other
booths have pens?

09:40.800 --> 09:42.480
We set up last night.

09:42.560 --> 09:44.080
I'm sure I put one in there.

09:44.160 --> 09:46.920
Well, it was quite late,
maybe you forgot.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.280
So, after handing
Mr Pearce the pen.

09:49.360 --> 09:50.760
You went straight
back to your desk?

09:50.840 --> 09:51.840
Yes.

09:51.920 --> 09:53.800
KEMAR: He did.

09:53.880 --> 09:56.000
When I heard my dad
asking for the pen,

09:56.080 --> 09:58.440
I looked out to see it was
being dealt with.

10:01.240 --> 10:02.480
That only leaves one person.

10:04.520 --> 10:05.840
Catherine Bordey.

10:07.280 --> 10:08.320
Well,
she was the one in the booth

10:08.400 --> 10:10.040
next to my father.

10:10.120 --> 10:11.960
When the Reverend went
back to his desk.

10:12.040 --> 10:13.840
She could have leaned out
and stabbed him then.

10:13.920 --> 10:16.400
But I only went to him when
I saw the blood on the floor.

10:16.480 --> 10:17.640
All right!

10:17.720 --> 10:19.760
Thank you all
very much indeed.

10:19.840 --> 10:21.080
I think we'll
leave it there for now.

10:21.160 --> 10:23.160
And we'll try not
to bother you again.

10:23.240 --> 10:25.160
But if you could just make
sure the officer here

10:25.240 --> 10:27.200
has details of where you
can be contacted.

10:27.280 --> 10:29.520
On the off-chance we might
have to speak to you again.

10:30.240 --> 10:31.200
OK.

10:44.320 --> 10:46.320
Good job, sir.

10:46.400 --> 10:49.480
Well, I'm no Van Gogh,
Florence, but each to his own.

10:49.560 --> 10:52.520
So, shall we go over what
we have so far?

10:52.600 --> 10:54.560
Victor Pearce, what do we
know about him?

10:54.640 --> 10:56.920
Sixty-three,
born and raised in Honore.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.680
Set up a boat-hire business
when he left school at 18.

11:00.760 --> 11:03.160
Now owns several businesses
on Saint Marie.

11:03.240 --> 11:05.440
And would he have
made a popular mayor,
do you think?

11:05.520 --> 11:07.560
Some people
didn't like his plans

11:07.640 --> 11:09.080
to commercialise the island.

11:09.160 --> 11:11.560
But the polls predicted
he was likely to win.

11:11.640 --> 11:14.560
He had the money to run
a much bigger campaign.

11:14.640 --> 11:17.680
And who's going to inherit
all this wealth? His son?

11:17.760 --> 11:19.440
We are waiting
for confirmation

11:19.520 --> 11:21.040
but that seems to be the case.

11:21.120 --> 11:22.520
So, if Kemar Pearce

11:22.600 --> 11:24.720
was going to inherit all of
daddy's money.

11:24.800 --> 11:26.440
I guess that's the motive.

11:26.520 --> 11:30.240
Been working as his father's
P.A. for the last few months.

11:30.320 --> 11:31.880
But before that,
there's not much.

11:34.240 --> 11:35.560
Peter Baxter.

11:35.640 --> 11:37.400
Grew up in the UK.

11:37.480 --> 11:39.280
Trained as a teacher,
moved here to
work ten years ago.

11:39.360 --> 11:40.720
Married with two children.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.440
He's big on family values

11:42.520 --> 11:45.360
and promoting education in
the community.

11:45.440 --> 11:48.880
Next is Ms Edwina Bousquet.

11:48.960 --> 11:51.160
Ah,
the indominable Ms Bousquet.

11:51.240 --> 11:54.160
I've met a lot like her in
my time, Florence.

11:54.240 --> 11:56.400
Fair few of them
in my own family.

11:56.480 --> 11:58.520
Edwina Bousquet is 62.

11:58.600 --> 12:00.160
No children, never married.

12:00.240 --> 12:02.320
Retired but used to
work at the library.

12:02.400 --> 12:04.920
Now she helps with the church,
doing flowers, etcetera.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.480
Which leaves us with...

12:06.560 --> 12:11.200
Reverend Matthew Dawson
and his wife, Judith.

12:11.280 --> 12:13.880
Reverend Dawson
is the minister
at Saint Anne's.

12:13.960 --> 12:15.320
Originally from London.

12:15.400 --> 12:16.960
Came to Saint
Marie eight years ago.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.760
Which is when he
met Mrs Dawson,

12:18.840 --> 12:21.440
who was volunteering
at the church orphanage.

12:21.520 --> 12:23.400
She was an orphan
at Saint Anne's herself

12:23.480 --> 12:25.960
until she was taken in
by a local family.

12:28.600 --> 12:30.320
JACK: So, these two...

12:30.400 --> 12:32.120
They run
the orphanage together?

12:32.200 --> 12:35.200
That's right. And I found
one thing of interest

12:35.280 --> 12:37.520
in the church's
online newsletter.

12:37.600 --> 12:39.960
There's been an ongoing
dispute between the Dawsons

12:40.040 --> 12:41.320
and Victor Pearce.

12:41.400 --> 12:42.960
We are still looking into it,

12:43.040 --> 12:45.040
but it seems
Mr Pearce was trying

12:45.120 --> 12:47.000
to buy the land
the orphanage is on

12:47.080 --> 12:49.840
so he could develop
a holiday village there.

12:49.920 --> 12:51.880
Reverend Dawson wasn't
gonna stand for that.

12:51.960 --> 12:52.920
No, sir.

12:54.240 --> 12:56.440
OK, so that's five.

12:56.520 --> 12:57.480
Who's left?

13:00.720 --> 13:03.760
Ah, Catherine. Well...

13:03.840 --> 13:05.120
You know her better than me.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.440
Are there any circumstances

13:07.520 --> 13:09.440
in which she
might be our killer?

13:09.520 --> 13:11.200
No, sir.

13:11.280 --> 13:12.720
I'd stake my life on it.

13:22.600 --> 13:24.280
(JP CHATTERING)

13:24.360 --> 13:26.960
Ah, lads. How did you get on
at the victim's house?

13:27.040 --> 13:28.080
Very nice.

13:28.160 --> 13:29.720
Swimming pool, hot tub.

13:29.800 --> 13:31.080
Gym in the basement.

13:31.160 --> 13:32.960
That sounds lovely, Dwayne.

13:33.040 --> 13:35.480
Yeah... Anything that might
help us catch a killer?

13:35.560 --> 13:38.160
Well we got
everything we could
find, sir. Just like you said.

13:38.240 --> 13:40.280
Good stuff, now.

13:40.360 --> 13:43.160
One or more of these five
people killed Victor Pearce.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.880
In cold blood and
in broad daylight.

13:45.960 --> 13:47.360
Now whatever sort
of a man he was,

13:47.440 --> 13:49.480
we can't let them
get away with that.

13:49.560 --> 13:52.000
Yeah, I know it's late.

13:52.080 --> 13:54.400
But I'd like to
get as much done
as possible this evening.

13:54.480 --> 13:55.880
Yes, sir.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.280
OK, background
and finance checks.

13:58.360 --> 13:59.840
Police, regional council,

13:59.920 --> 14:01.680
government
records on all five.

14:01.760 --> 14:03.280
But, Sarge...

14:03.360 --> 14:04.320
Chop, chop.

14:08.320 --> 14:09.400
DWAYNE: OK.

14:38.560 --> 14:40.680
Siobhan, that lizard's back!

14:40.760 --> 14:43.440
SIOBHAN: He's called Harry.

14:43.520 --> 14:45.760
Well, he doesn't
look like a "Harry."

14:45.840 --> 14:47.400
He probably wants feeding.

14:47.480 --> 14:49.080
Surely he can do
that for himself.

14:49.160 --> 14:52.480
Catch things with that
ridiculous tongue of his.

14:52.560 --> 14:56.080
Well JP said he likes
mangoes and mozzies mashed up.

14:56.160 --> 14:58.280
Ah, so now we're mashing up
mosquitoes for a lizard.

14:58.360 --> 14:59.520
Seriously, Siobhan?

14:59.600 --> 15:01.480
We're not in
London any more, Dad.

15:01.560 --> 15:03.760
You have to expect things to
be a little different.

15:04.280 --> 15:06.120
Ah.

15:06.200 --> 15:07.680
I was going to talk
to you about that.

15:09.160 --> 15:10.480
The Commissioner wants to know

15:10.560 --> 15:12.240
if I would stay here.

15:12.920 --> 15:13.920
Permanently.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.280
Oh?

15:16.360 --> 15:17.840
So,
come on, what do you think?

15:17.920 --> 15:19.440
What do you think?

15:19.520 --> 15:20.480
The honest truth is...

15:22.280 --> 15:24.760
I couldn't be happy here
if you weren't.

15:27.640 --> 15:28.600
Any way.

15:29.680 --> 15:32.360
With everything
that's happened.

15:32.440 --> 15:34.360
I need very much
for you to be happy.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.640
Can I think about it?

15:38.720 --> 15:40.040
Of course you can, love.

15:41.960 --> 15:42.920
OK.

15:45.560 --> 15:46.520
(SIGHS)

15:53.960 --> 15:55.400
FLORENCE: Poor Catherine.

15:55.480 --> 15:57.480
I want to know where they
got this information.

15:57.560 --> 15:59.680
Maybe someone is trying
to deflect attention

15:59.760 --> 16:02.120
-away from themselves.
-Exactly.

16:02.200 --> 16:03.480
Right, I'm going to the paper.

16:03.560 --> 16:04.680
See what I can find out.

16:04.760 --> 16:05.760
Yes please, Dwayne.

16:06.640 --> 16:08.080
Hello, Honore Police.

16:08.160 --> 16:09.480
Oh.

16:09.560 --> 16:11.160
And I spoke
to Victor Pearce's solicitor.

16:11.240 --> 16:14.240
And he confirmed that Victor
left everything to his son.

16:14.320 --> 16:15.280
JACK: OK, thank you.
JP: Right.

16:16.320 --> 16:17.280
I have something, sir.

16:19.160 --> 16:21.520
I'm not sure if it means
anything but the victim

16:21.600 --> 16:23.640
went to the same school
as Edwina Bousquet.

16:23.720 --> 16:24.920
Vieux Moulin Secondary.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.640
She never
mentioned that, did she?

16:26.720 --> 16:29.160
Well, it was a long time ago.

16:29.240 --> 16:31.920
My mum is friends with the old
headmistress at Vieux Moulin.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
She's been visiting friends
in Montserrat,

16:34.080 --> 16:35.160
but is back this evening.

16:35.840 --> 16:36.880
Sir?

16:36.960 --> 16:38.200
Yes, JP?

16:38.280 --> 16:39.880
JP: That was our contact
from the council.

16:39.960 --> 16:41.720
He said the only way

16:41.800 --> 16:43.160
for Victor Pearce
to buy the orphanage

16:43.240 --> 16:45.000
would be if it
was closed down.

16:45.080 --> 16:46.560
And the only reason why
that would happen

16:46.640 --> 16:48.080
would be if it's
funding was cut.

16:48.160 --> 16:49.600
And is that a possibility?

16:49.680 --> 16:51.880
It would have been if Victor
Pearce had been elected.

16:51.960 --> 16:54.400
The funding for the orphanage
falls directly under

16:54.480 --> 16:55.920
the control of the mayor.

16:56.000 --> 16:56.960
Oh.

17:07.040 --> 17:08.840
No, nothing important.

17:08.920 --> 17:11.040
And we'll try to be
as quick as we can.

17:11.120 --> 17:13.080
I do hope we haven't come
under suspicion?

17:13.160 --> 17:15.480
No, no, heavens no.

17:15.560 --> 17:18.320
You've made it very clear
where you both
were when the...

17:18.400 --> 17:20.120
Terrible deed took place.

17:20.200 --> 17:21.960
And you can't be in two places
at once, can you?

17:22.040 --> 17:23.200
No.

17:23.280 --> 17:25.000
Now,
what was it we needed to ask?

17:25.080 --> 17:27.080
It's just a tiny
thing if I remember.

17:27.840 --> 17:29.000
Ah, yes.

17:29.080 --> 17:30.840
You had a dispute
with the victim.

17:30.920 --> 17:33.600
About him cutting funding to
the orphanage,

17:33.680 --> 17:35.040
turfing you out,

17:35.120 --> 17:37.160
and building a holiday resort
on the land.

17:39.280 --> 17:41.360
Ah, well, uh...

17:41.440 --> 17:43.240
Yes, but...

17:43.320 --> 17:45.480
Well, it wasn't
quite that clear cut.

17:45.560 --> 17:47.120
It wasn't?

17:47.200 --> 17:50.440
Well, ignore my clumsy way
of putting things.

17:50.520 --> 17:53.440
You explain how it was.

17:53.520 --> 17:54.920
Well, I mean,
it was common knowledge

17:55.000 --> 17:56.600
he owned
the land surrounding us.

17:56.680 --> 18:00.240
So yes, the orphanage was
of interest to him.

18:00.320 --> 18:01.720
And what would have happened
to the children?

18:02.760 --> 18:04.240
Well...

18:04.320 --> 18:07.000
We only have three children in
our care at the moment.

18:07.080 --> 18:08.480
They would have been moved
to an orphanage

18:08.560 --> 18:10.240
in one of the other islands,
where there are...

18:10.320 --> 18:12.120
Bigger and better facilities.

18:12.200 --> 18:14.000
You must have
been worried sick.

18:14.080 --> 18:15.640
Well we were worried,
of course.

18:16.760 --> 18:17.720
But not any more.

18:23.360 --> 18:25.680
And was any of this
discussed yesterday

18:25.760 --> 18:27.840
when Victor arrived at
the polling station?

18:27.920 --> 18:30.560
No, I don't even think he even
knew who we were.

18:30.640 --> 18:32.440
We did try and arrange
a meeting, but...

18:32.520 --> 18:34.360
He was a hard man to get
an appointment with.

18:35.600 --> 18:37.080
Still, as they say,

18:37.160 --> 18:39.200
"It's an ill wind that blows
nobody any good."

18:40.960 --> 18:42.600
By that I mean Victor's death,

18:42.680 --> 18:44.360
tragic and all as it was,

18:44.440 --> 18:47.840
well, at least it
means the orphanage
is still safe.

18:47.920 --> 18:50.400
Not that either of you wished
the poor man dead.

18:50.480 --> 18:52.000
Of course not, no.

18:55.920 --> 18:58.480
Ah, the children, they're back
for their lunch.

19:05.560 --> 19:07.200
Ready steady, hop up.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.400
JACK: Lovely kids.

19:10.360 --> 19:11.840
Have they been with you long?

19:11.920 --> 19:13.280
Mazy since she was four,

19:13.360 --> 19:14.760
the boys since
they were babies.

19:16.440 --> 19:18.480
Do you mind me asking,
do you and Mrs Dawson

19:18.560 --> 19:19.640
have children of your own?

19:19.720 --> 19:20.880
No, we don't.

19:20.960 --> 19:23.160
It never quite
happened for us.

19:23.240 --> 19:24.600
I'm sorry. It's not my...

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

19:31.600 --> 19:33.040

19:33.120 --> 19:35.280
Answering all our questions,
very good of you.

19:35.360 --> 19:36.720
We'll try not to
bother you again.

19:37.960 --> 19:38.920
Thank you.

19:52.240 --> 19:53.680
Don't worry about them.

through the motions.

Dwayne?

20:14.720 --> 20:16.240
I hope that newspaper report

20:16.320 --> 20:18.560
doesn't ruin Catherine's
chances of becoming mayor.

20:19.360 --> 20:20.800
Well you know, JP,

20:20.880 --> 20:22.080
it might not be a bad thing.

20:23.400 --> 20:24.360
What?

20:24.960 --> 20:26.120
Look,

20:26.200 --> 20:27.320
it's not that I
don't like Catherine,

20:27.400 --> 20:28.640
of course I do.

20:28.720 --> 20:30.440
-But when it comes to...
-Wait.

20:30.520 --> 20:32.480
Are you saying
that you wouldn't
vote for her?

No, no, no, no, you see...

20:34.360 --> 20:35.440
It's like this, JP.

20:36.720 --> 20:38.320
There's a little
establishment I know

20:38.400 --> 20:40.320
that sells rum at
what I would call

20:40.400 --> 20:42.080
a very reasonable price.

20:42.160 --> 20:43.600
-Is there now?
-Oh, yes.

20:43.680 --> 20:46.120

20:46.200 --> 20:48.960
Catherine does not look
too kindly upon.

You understand me?

Don't worry Dwayne.

I understand you.

20:53.640 --> 20:55.480
-Good.
-Mmm.

20:55.560 --> 20:57.400
You don't want Catherine
to become mayor

20:57.480 --> 21:00.080
because you
won't be able to buy
your cheap rum any more.

put it like that, OK?

our friend, and you...

"Victim died from

Well, I don't have a clue,
what that is,

21:31.520 --> 21:32.880

knife in his back

21:32.960 --> 21:34.000

Yeah.

We got some partials but
nothing we can use.

21:43.560 --> 21:45.600
Any more news on
the victim's finances?

21:45.680 --> 21:48.000
Well, looking at the paperwork
we took from the house

21:48.080 --> 21:50.680
it's pretty
clear that, up until
a few months ago,

21:50.760 --> 21:53.120
Victor was throwing a whole
heap of money at his son.

21:53.200 --> 21:54.720
What happened
a couple of months ago?

21:54.800 --> 21:57.040
Kemar was put on Victor's
company payroll

21:57.120 --> 21:58.720
as his personal assistant.

21:58.800 --> 22:00.280
He was still
paying him though.

22:00.360 --> 22:02.800
Yes but significantly
less than before.

22:02.880 --> 22:06.240
So dad was trying to curb
his son's spending?

22:06.320 --> 22:08.240
DWAYNE: If he was
it didn't work.

22:08.320 --> 22:10.440
As far as I can see,
Kemar carried
on as if nothing had changed.

22:10.520 --> 22:12.120
You know, flashy flashy.

22:12.200 --> 22:14.360
I mean, it's only been a
couple of months.

22:14.440 --> 22:16.680
But he's in a heck
of a lot of debt.

22:16.760 --> 22:18.480
FLORENCE:
And his father didn't help.

22:18.560 --> 22:21.560
Far from it. Two days ago,
his salary wasn't paid.

22:21.640 --> 22:23.240
So I checked with
the bank as to why.

22:23.320 --> 22:24.960
Seems Victor had put a bar

22:25.040 --> 22:27.880
on all transactions going from
his account into his son's.

22:28.600 --> 22:29.760
Two days ago?

22:29.840 --> 22:31.160
Next morning, Victor's dead.

22:32.280 --> 22:33.760
And Kemar inherits everything.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.600
I can see how it
looks, Inspector.

22:44.680 --> 22:46.600
But trust me.

22:46.680 --> 22:48.520
Dad wasn't
going to cut me off.

22:48.600 --> 22:51.400
I'm sure,
and I'm sorry to have
to ask you these things.

22:53.720 --> 22:56.040
It's just that we have
to report back, you see.

22:56.120 --> 22:57.720
He went into one sometimes.

22:57.800 --> 22:59.360
Trying to make a point.

22:59.440 --> 23:00.760
But it never lasted long.

23:00.840 --> 23:02.920
Well that's not the impression
we have of him.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
I mean he was a successful
businessman, wasn't he?

23:06.080 --> 23:08.080
Strong-willed, ruthless even.

23:08.160 --> 23:09.440
Yeah but...

23:09.520 --> 23:12.160
Things were different with me.

23:12.240 --> 23:14.920
Because ever since my
mum died when I was ten

23:15.000 --> 23:17.520
he hasn't had the faintest
clue what to do with me.

23:17.600 --> 23:18.680
What do you mean?

23:18.760 --> 23:20.520
The only reason
he wanted a child

23:20.600 --> 23:22.880
was so that he
had someone to carry
on his business empire

23:22.960 --> 23:25.280
after he died, his legacy.

23:25.360 --> 23:28.080
As far as actually raising me
was concerned,

23:28.160 --> 23:29.880
he couldn't have cared less.

23:29.960 --> 23:31.800
That was supposed
to be your mum's job?

23:33.920 --> 23:35.360
So he did what he does,

23:35.440 --> 23:37.320
whenever there is a problem
that needs solving,

23:38.360 --> 23:40.080
he threw money at it.

23:40.160 --> 23:41.560
At me.

23:41.640 --> 23:43.000
And he's been doing the
same ever since.

23:44.080 --> 23:45.040
So...

23:46.520 --> 23:48.360
Look, you're right.

23:48.440 --> 23:51.360
I wasn't happy
about him trying
to cut back on my spending.

23:53.080 --> 23:55.360
But you can't really think I
killed him because of it.

23:55.440 --> 23:57.240
Heavens no, how could you?

23:57.320 --> 23:58.960
You explained where you were.

23:59.040 --> 24:00.280
No, we're just looking at

24:00.360 --> 24:03.080
your dad's state
of mind, that's all.

24:03.160 --> 24:04.640
We shouldn't
have bothered you.

24:04.720 --> 24:06.000
Especially at
a time like this.

24:06.880 --> 24:08.040
No problem.

24:13.400 --> 24:14.760
JACK: Two questions.

24:14.840 --> 24:17.000
Who and how?

24:17.080 --> 24:19.240
And, to be honest,
we're no closer to either.

24:19.320 --> 24:22.320
But ignoring
the how for a moment,
let's think about the who.

24:22.400 --> 24:25.360
Reverend Dawson
and his wife, Judith.

24:25.440 --> 24:26.920
They faced
losing the orphanage

24:27.000 --> 24:29.040
if Victor Pearce
was elected mayor.

24:29.120 --> 24:31.160
I checked with the council
and apparently

24:31.240 --> 24:33.400
Reverend and
Mrs Dawson had applied

24:33.480 --> 24:35.960
to adopt the three children
at Saint Anne's.

24:36.040 --> 24:37.440
But it was the early days,

24:37.520 --> 24:39.720
and the process
could take a few years.

24:39.800 --> 24:41.200
None of which is a problem now

24:41.280 --> 24:43.480
that Mr Pearce is
no longer with us.

24:43.560 --> 24:45.120
Rest his soul.

24:45.200 --> 24:47.560
That said,
both alibis seem solid.

24:48.280 --> 24:49.760
Kemar Pearce.

24:49.840 --> 24:52.120
Victor threatened to cut
him off financially.

24:52.200 --> 24:53.240
But he claims
that his dad would

24:53.320 --> 24:54.760
never have gone
through with it.

24:54.840 --> 24:56.200
And I think he was telling
the truth about that.

24:56.280 --> 24:58.520
So. If he didn't
believe his father

24:58.600 --> 24:59.960
would cut the purse strings,

25:00.040 --> 25:01.000
why kill him?

25:02.520 --> 25:05.880
Which leaves Edwina Bousquet
and Peter Baxter.

25:05.960 --> 25:08.480
But neither has
an obvious motive.

25:08.560 --> 25:10.640
Well, I've been going through
the victim's phone records.

25:10.720 --> 25:11.840
Now there's a lot of calls

25:11.920 --> 25:13.880
between him and his son,
as you'd expect.

25:13.960 --> 25:15.760
No contact with any of
the other suspects,

25:15.840 --> 25:17.040
apart from calls between him

25:17.120 --> 25:18.840
and Peter Baxter
over the last week.

25:18.920 --> 25:20.680
But as they're both
mayoral candidates,

25:20.760 --> 25:23.360
there's no
suggestion that there's
anything sinister in that.

25:23.440 --> 25:24.440
Right.

25:24.520 --> 25:26.440
Anything on his computer?

25:26.520 --> 25:28.280
Well I finished going
through his laptop.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.920
I get the impression he was
a bit of a workaholic.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.440
His e-mails?

25:32.520 --> 25:36.040
All business, nothing
personal in there at all.

25:36.120 --> 25:37.680
Which currently
leaves us right back

25:37.760 --> 25:39.600
at the beginning
of this investigation.

25:39.680 --> 25:41.920
In Saint Anne's Community
Centre on polling day

25:42.000 --> 25:44.040
mayoral candidate,
Victor Pearce

25:44.120 --> 25:47.360
was casting his vote, when one
of these five suspects managed

25:47.440 --> 25:50.600
to scuttle into
his booth unseen
and stick a knife in his back.

25:51.440 --> 25:52.920
Sorry, sorry about that.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
But how could
nobody see it happen?

25:58.480 --> 25:59.760
JACK: Haven't the foggiest.

26:01.360 --> 26:03.240
Hmm.

26:03.320 --> 26:04.600
Well, I don't know
about the rest of you,

26:04.680 --> 26:06.240
but I could do with a beer.

26:06.320 --> 26:08.000
Hey, what say we say we show
a bit of solidarity

26:08.080 --> 26:09.880
with Catherine and go and have
a drink in her place?

26:09.960 --> 26:11.800
Actually,
sir, I should get over to my

26:11.880 --> 26:14.080
mum's friend's house,
she'll be home now.

26:14.160 --> 26:16.240
But I might pop along later?

26:16.320 --> 26:18.040
Ah, yes, of course.
You go and do that.

26:18.120 --> 26:19.200
Dwayne, JP?

26:19.280 --> 26:20.280
You know what, sir?

26:20.360 --> 26:22.640
I think that is a great idea.

26:22.720 --> 26:25.080
What do you think, Dwayne?

26:25.160 --> 26:26.720
Show Catherine
a bit of solidarity?

26:29.400 --> 26:31.280
Yes, of course, sir.

26:31.360 --> 26:32.960
Solidarity.

26:33.040 --> 26:34.160
I'm all for that.

26:34.240 --> 26:35.200
Great.

26:43.160 --> 26:46.240
Ah, Catherine. There you are.
Good to see you.

26:46.320 --> 26:48.360
-You're bearing up?
-I am.

26:48.440 --> 26:51.600
People have been very kind
and come out to
show their support.

26:51.680 --> 26:53.160
Don't worry, Catherine.

26:53.240 --> 26:55.760
We're trying to find out
where it's coming from.

26:55.840 --> 26:58.040
Have someone at the newspaper
digging around.

26:58.120 --> 26:59.720
Thank you, Dwayne.

26:59.800 --> 27:01.760
You're all such good friends.

27:01.840 --> 27:03.280
CATHERINE: These are on me
as a thank you.

27:03.360 --> 27:05.160
JACK: That's very good of you,
Catherine.

27:05.240 --> 27:06.200
To good friends.

27:07.520 --> 27:09.160
To good friends.

27:13.040 --> 27:15.280
That's got a bit
of a kick to it.

27:15.360 --> 27:18.280
Wait, you never tried
any of the local rums before?

27:18.360 --> 27:20.440
Not usually a rum
drinker to be honest
with you, Dwayne.

27:21.280 --> 27:22.240
Not yet.

27:23.880 --> 27:25.560
So...

27:25.640 --> 27:27.920
Are you any closer to finding
out who killed Victor Pearce?

27:28.000 --> 27:30.040
Well, we're not quite
there yet, Catherine.

27:30.120 --> 27:31.440
But we're
making good progress.

27:37.840 --> 27:40.160
I can only imagine how hard
this is for you.

27:40.240 --> 27:43.400
With everything that's been
said in the papers and all.

27:43.480 --> 27:45.440
But I'm gonna find
out who did this.

27:45.520 --> 27:46.480
It's a promise.

27:57.240 --> 27:58.520
JACK: Morning.

28:00.120 --> 28:01.400
You all right there, JP?

28:02.840 --> 28:04.320
I'm fine sir, I just

28:04.400 --> 28:06.040
can't quite make
sense of something.

28:06.120 --> 28:08.040
Oh, yeah, what is it?

28:08.120 --> 28:09.480
OK, so I'm going through

28:09.560 --> 28:11.320
Victor Pearce's
appointments diary.

28:11.400 --> 28:13.600
And cross-referencing it
with his journal.

28:13.680 --> 28:16.200
Now,
he makes notes from all his
meeting in there.

28:16.280 --> 28:18.360
You know,
writes in action plans.

28:18.440 --> 28:20.760
The man
cross-references everything.

28:20.840 --> 28:22.520
I'm sensing a "but" coming.

28:22.600 --> 28:25.040
(SIGHS)
Well there is, sort of.

28:25.120 --> 28:28.080
See,
last Tuesday in his diary,
there's an appointment.

28:28.160 --> 28:31.720
Paradise Bay Hotel,
7:00 p.m., room 303.

28:31.800 --> 28:34.480
But there's no references
of what it was about

28:34.560 --> 28:36.520
or who he was going to meet,
or anything.

28:37.800 --> 28:38.760
No notes anywhere else?

28:39.640 --> 28:41.720
Nothing.

28:41.800 --> 28:45.200
OK,
why don't you both head over
to the hotel

28:45.280 --> 28:47.200
and see if anyone knows
what he was doing there.

28:47.280 --> 28:48.360
Yes, sir.

28:48.440 --> 28:49.640
OK, thank you.

28:49.720 --> 28:51.000
Sarge.

28:51.080 --> 28:52.040
Dwayne.

28:53.320 --> 28:54.400
Morning, Florence.

28:54.480 --> 28:56.160
Morning, sir.

28:56.240 --> 28:58.920
So,
how did you get on with your
mum's friend last night?

28:59.000 --> 29:00.400
She have anything
interesting to say

29:00.480 --> 29:02.400
about Edwina Bousquet
and Victor Pearce's

29:02.480 --> 29:04.080
time together at school?

29:04.160 --> 29:06.360
Better than interesting.

29:06.440 --> 29:10.160
Edwina Bousquet
and Victor Pearce
were high school sweethearts.

29:10.240 --> 29:11.960
Never.

29:12.040 --> 29:13.800
This was taken
on a field trip.

29:13.880 --> 29:16.960
This is Edwina
and Victor here.

29:17.040 --> 29:20.720
They were dating
for about six months
before they graduated,

29:20.800 --> 29:23.200
at which point Victor ended
it between them.

29:23.280 --> 29:26.760
Apparently,
he was so focused on setting
up his first business,

29:26.840 --> 29:29.760
he said he didn't have time
for a relationship.

29:29.840 --> 29:30.880
Now, that I can believe.

29:30.960 --> 29:33.360
It seems she was
broken-hearted.

29:33.440 --> 29:35.200
She never had
a boyfriend before.

29:35.280 --> 29:37.840
Her parents were
very religious, very strict,

29:37.920 --> 29:41.920
so it was the first time
she'd experienced
anything like that.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.440
First love
is a powerful thing, Florence.

29:45.520 --> 29:51.080
And, the sad thing is,
he was her first
love and her last.

29:51.160 --> 29:53.040
There's never
been anyone since.

29:53.120 --> 29:56.640
So, all those years ago

29:56.720 --> 29:58.720
Victor Pearce
broke Edwina's heart

30:00.000 --> 30:01.800
and she's still hurting now.

30:11.320 --> 30:13.720
They are looking lovely,
Ms Bousquet.

30:13.800 --> 30:15.960
I do my best for the church,
Inspector.

30:16.040 --> 30:17.600
I'm sure you do.

30:17.680 --> 30:20.440
And I bet you no one ever
thanks you for it, do they?

30:20.520 --> 30:22.640
I had an aunt once
exactly the same.

30:22.720 --> 30:25.880
Oh yeah, the unsung
hero of our parish.

30:25.960 --> 30:27.520
So much so that when
she went abroad for

30:27.600 --> 30:29.480
the first time,
on her 60th birthday,

30:29.560 --> 30:31.160
the church didn't
know what hit it.

30:31.240 --> 30:34.200
I assume you're here
for a reason, Inspector.

30:34.280 --> 30:36.960
Aside from sharing stories
about your aunt.

30:37.040 --> 30:39.280
You have seen
through me, Ms Bousquet.

30:39.360 --> 30:42.240
There are actually
a couple of questions
that we have to ask.

30:42.320 --> 30:43.480
Would you mind terribly?

30:43.560 --> 30:45.080
You have your job to do.

30:45.160 --> 30:47.920
We've been doing
a bit of digging
about Victor Pearce,

30:48.000 --> 30:49.880
and we've come
across this photo.

30:51.960 --> 30:54.000
It shows you and
Victor together.

30:54.840 --> 30:56.360
Were you close?

30:56.440 --> 30:59.160
I know it was a long way back,
but we do have to ask.

30:59.240 --> 31:01.600
We were companions
for a short while.

31:02.440 --> 31:04.240
Six months, if that.

31:04.320 --> 31:06.800
And what was your
relationship like
in more recent times?

31:06.880 --> 31:08.640
-We didn't have one.
-Nothing at all?

31:08.720 --> 31:10.880
The occasional good morning.
Nothing more.

31:10.960 --> 31:12.760
Well,
that's very sad, isn't it?

31:13.880 --> 31:15.800
Two people this close,

31:15.880 --> 31:19.160
and all these
years later, reduced to
exchanging the odd pleasantry.

31:19.240 --> 31:21.040
EDWINA:
It's what happens, Inspector.

31:21.120 --> 31:23.360
People move on from
things very quickly.

31:23.440 --> 31:25.520
Very kind face, doesn't he?
In that photo.

31:26.880 --> 31:29.440
He was nothing like
the man he became.

31:29.520 --> 31:32.400
He was warm and
caring back then.

31:32.480 --> 31:34.840
He showed an interest in me
when many didn't.

31:35.840 --> 31:38.920
The uptight church girl.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.680
He saw something in me
and brought it out.

31:41.760 --> 31:44.160
FLORENCE: We know he ended
things suddenly

31:44.240 --> 31:46.600
to concentrate
on his business?

31:46.680 --> 31:47.920
That's something
only he would know.

31:49.760 --> 31:51.280
If the point of
these questions is to

31:51.360 --> 31:52.880
find out whether
or not he hurt me,

31:52.960 --> 31:56.000
the answer is yes, terribly.

31:56.080 --> 31:58.320
But I'm
a Christian woman, Inspector,

31:58.400 --> 32:01.920
and while I may not be able
to forget how he hurt me,

32:02.000 --> 32:03.240
I can forgive.

32:07.080 --> 32:08.400
Do you think I killed him?

32:08.480 --> 32:10.320
I don't see how.

32:10.400 --> 32:12.600
If I recall,
you were in the store
cupboard when it happened.

32:12.680 --> 32:14.240
Yes, I was.

32:14.320 --> 32:15.600
I'm just trying
to paint a picture,
nothing more.

32:15.680 --> 32:17.040
Sorry to have disturbed you.

32:26.520 --> 32:27.520
Inspector?

32:28.760 --> 32:30.480
Not after me, were you?

32:30.560 --> 32:32.640
No, Reverend,
I think we're done here
for now. Thank you.

32:32.720 --> 32:34.040
-(MOBILE RINGING)
-Excuse me.

32:34.120 --> 32:35.280
I better take this.

32:36.200 --> 32:37.360
Hello?

32:37.440 --> 32:39.320
Actually,
I'm glad I caught you.

32:39.400 --> 32:41.440
The last few days
have rather taken
their toll on the parish,

32:41.520 --> 32:43.360
so we're holding
a prayer service
this afternoon.

32:43.440 --> 32:45.160
You're both,
of course, invited.

32:45.240 --> 32:47.040
Well, that's very good of you.
And we'll do our
best to make it.

32:47.120 --> 32:50.600
-Lovely.
-FLORENCE:
We'll be there shortly.

32:50.680 --> 32:53.600
Sir, that was Dwayne.
He and JP think
they might have a lead.

32:53.680 --> 32:54.640
Great.

33:03.640 --> 33:05.320
JACK: So, what have we got?

33:05.400 --> 33:07.840
Well, me and JP spoke
to the receptionist

33:07.920 --> 33:11.280
about Victor Pearce's meeting
here at the hotel
last Tuesday.

33:11.360 --> 33:13.400
So, she checked
the booking system

33:13.480 --> 33:18.000
and room 303 was reserved
by a woman called
Verity Browning.

33:18.080 --> 33:19.960
So Victor was
meeting a woman here?

33:20.040 --> 33:21.360
That's what we assumed,

33:21.440 --> 33:22.840
but we thought
we'd double check

33:22.920 --> 33:25.120
and have a look at the CCTV
outside room 303.

33:25.200 --> 33:26.320
And what did it show?

33:26.400 --> 33:27.760
Come and have a look.

33:27.840 --> 33:29.720
OK,
JP, show them what you got.

33:29.800 --> 33:33.240
You see, it wasn't our victim
Ms Browning was
having a liaison with.

33:33.320 --> 33:35.080
It was Peter Baxter.

33:35.160 --> 33:37.080
(CHUCKLES)

33:37.160 --> 33:40.000
So, what? Victor
Pearce knew about this.

33:40.080 --> 33:42.400
That's why he had room 303
written into his diary.

33:42.480 --> 33:44.120
Well, we think so, sir.

33:44.200 --> 33:46.680
I mean, why else would he have
the exact hotel room number

33:46.760 --> 33:49.240
and time Peter
Baxter was in there
with another woman?

33:49.320 --> 33:51.080
They were both
running for mayor,

33:51.160 --> 33:53.880
so maybe Victor threatened
to reveal the affair.

33:53.960 --> 33:55.720
And that would explain
why the phone record showed

33:55.800 --> 33:57.120
that Baxter and
Pearce had been

33:57.200 --> 33:59.120
calling each
other the last week.

33:59.200 --> 34:01.720
And there's more.
I heard back from Chrissy
from the newspaper.

34:01.800 --> 34:03.680
Now, she can't be sure,

34:03.760 --> 34:06.800
but the rumour is the person
they quoted in
the Catherine story

34:07.680 --> 34:08.800
was Peter Baxter.

34:18.960 --> 34:20.120
He's over there, sir.

34:23.440 --> 34:26.120
Mr Baxter,
do you have a minute?

34:26.200 --> 34:29.040
Jen, could you take
over for a moment?

34:32.400 --> 34:33.400
Shall we go inside?

34:36.600 --> 34:40.440
Excuse the mess.
It's been a hectic few weeks.

34:40.520 --> 34:43.680
"A vote for Peter Baxter
is a vote for integrity.

34:43.760 --> 34:45.560
"A vote for your
children's future."

34:45.640 --> 34:49.040
Really like that, Peter.
Positive message,
if ever I heard one.

34:49.120 --> 34:51.560
Seventy-three
percent of the adult
population on this island

34:51.640 --> 34:53.520
are married with children.

34:53.600 --> 34:55.280
It's their voices
that need listening to.

34:56.960 --> 34:59.160
So, what is it you wanted
to talk to me about?

34:59.240 --> 35:02.240
Oh, I'm sure it's nothing,
just ticking a few more boxes.

35:03.080 --> 35:05.560
Now, what was it?

35:05.640 --> 35:07.800
I'm sorry,
it's definitely
in here somewhere.

35:08.560 --> 35:10.680
Oh, here it is.

35:10.760 --> 35:13.840
Yeah, I was just wondering
what you were
doing in room 303

35:13.920 --> 35:16.480
at the Paradise Bay
last Tuesday evening.

35:20.840 --> 35:22.080
I...

35:23.680 --> 35:24.960
I mean...

35:25.040 --> 35:26.600
No, take your time.

35:26.680 --> 35:29.640
I mean, obviously,
we could ask Verity Browning

35:29.720 --> 35:31.840
who was also there.

35:31.920 --> 35:34.080
But we thought
we'd come to you first, Peter.

35:37.560 --> 35:39.800
Look, if it helps
to jog your memory,

35:39.880 --> 35:42.000
we could show you
some CCTV footage.

35:43.840 --> 35:45.560
Or maybe you
recall Victor Pearce

35:45.640 --> 35:47.200
calling you about
the very same thing.

35:48.320 --> 35:49.400
You know about that?

35:49.480 --> 35:50.720
We do, yes.

35:53.480 --> 35:56.720
He told me he had photographs
of me and Verity together.

35:56.800 --> 35:59.920
I mean,
I've no idea how he knew.
I mean,

36:01.040 --> 36:02.080
we'd been discreet.

36:03.080 --> 36:04.800
Or I thought we had.

36:04.880 --> 36:07.840
And what was
Mr Pearce threatening
to do with those photos?

36:07.920 --> 36:09.440
Well, what do you think?

36:09.520 --> 36:11.000
Go to the newspapers with them

36:11.080 --> 36:12.800
unless I stood down
and stopped running for mayor.

36:12.880 --> 36:14.240
Which you obviously didn't do.

36:16.320 --> 36:18.280
I was just wondering,

36:18.360 --> 36:19.560
did you have another plan?

36:22.520 --> 36:26.840
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
and as convenient
as it may look,

36:26.920 --> 36:29.560
it wasn't me that killed him.

36:29.640 --> 36:31.880
Victor wasn't the only one
with leverage.

36:31.960 --> 36:33.600
What do you mean?

36:33.680 --> 36:36.160
I told him to
publish and be damned,
but if he did,

36:36.240 --> 36:38.120
that I had my own
little bit of sordid gossip

36:38.200 --> 36:40.200
that I knew he wouldn't have
wanted getting out.

36:40.280 --> 36:42.760
Do you mind me
asking what was that?

36:42.840 --> 36:45.360
He's got
a daughter tucked away
on the island.

36:45.440 --> 36:47.360
Now, I mean, it's not exactly
the crime of the century,

36:47.440 --> 36:49.400
it's not as if he's
married or anything,

36:49.480 --> 36:52.160
but it would have
been a nice shot
across the bows.

36:52.240 --> 36:53.760
Mayor's secret love child.

36:55.120 --> 36:56.960
And you threatened
him back with this?

36:57.040 --> 36:59.280
Fight fire with
fire is what I say.

36:59.360 --> 37:02.000
When it comes to politics,
it's every man for himself.

37:06.280 --> 37:07.320
Mr Baxter,

37:08.720 --> 37:10.160
was it you who
leaked the story

37:10.240 --> 37:11.880
about Catherine
being prime suspect?

37:11.960 --> 37:15.080
I couldn't be a force for good
if I wasn't in power.

37:15.160 --> 37:16.120
(CHUCKLES)

37:17.520 --> 37:19.560
So that's what this
party's all about.

37:20.480 --> 37:22.320
Celebrating your win.

37:22.400 --> 37:26.200
Now that you've well
and truly scuppered
Catherine's chances.

37:26.280 --> 37:27.840
If there's
nothing else you need

37:27.920 --> 37:29.400
to speak to me about,
Inspector,

37:29.480 --> 37:31.080
I really should
be getting back
to my guests.

37:34.360 --> 37:36.760
JP: Why would he do something
like that?

37:36.840 --> 37:39.160
And Catherine saw
him as a friend.

37:39.240 --> 37:41.240
Because he's
a low-down dirty snake.

37:41.320 --> 37:43.440
Well,
that's politicians for you.

37:43.520 --> 37:45.800
OK, what do you say?
One last crack.

37:45.880 --> 37:47.480
See if we can't
solve this case.

37:48.760 --> 37:50.200
Five suspects,

37:50.280 --> 37:52.960
all of them have a motive
of one kind or another,

37:53.040 --> 37:54.520
and all of them have denied

37:54.600 --> 37:57.640
that those motives were enough
to drive them to murder.

37:57.720 --> 37:59.120
Peter Baxter.

37:59.200 --> 38:00.720
While he was being
threatened by Victor Pearce,

38:00.800 --> 38:03.640
he had the means
to threaten him right back.

38:03.720 --> 38:06.840
Edwina Bousquet.
She was once in love
with Victor Pearce.

38:06.920 --> 38:10.480
He broke her heart,
but she insists
she forgave him.

38:10.560 --> 38:12.080
Kemar Pearce
claims his father would

38:12.160 --> 38:13.600
never have
carried out as threat

38:13.680 --> 38:15.600
to cut him off financially.

38:15.680 --> 38:17.720
And as for the Dawsons,

38:17.800 --> 38:20.840
do we really believe
a clergyman and his wife

38:20.920 --> 38:24.600
would commit
murder simply to save
funding for their orphanage?

38:24.680 --> 38:26.640
And that's without
even having a clue

38:26.720 --> 38:28.640
how the murder
actually took place.

38:28.720 --> 38:30.880
(EXCLAIMS)

38:32.280 --> 38:34.600
Reverend Dawson
was back at his desk,

38:34.680 --> 38:36.760
Peter Baxter was in
the opposing booth,

38:36.840 --> 38:38.720
Kemar Pearce was
right next door,

38:38.800 --> 38:40.720
Edwina Bousquet
was in the store room

38:40.800 --> 38:44.160
and Judith Dawson
was just outside it, here.

38:44.240 --> 38:47.000
And all of them
can prove they were
where they say they were,

38:47.080 --> 38:50.680
when the knife was thrust
into Victor Pearce's back.

38:50.760 --> 38:52.880
So just how did the killer
manage to do it

38:52.960 --> 38:55.600
without anyone else
in the room seeing it?

38:55.680 --> 38:57.200
I mean, it has to
have been one of them.

38:57.280 --> 38:58.240
Yes, it did.

39:02.400 --> 39:03.680
Sir,

39:03.760 --> 39:05.080
the church service.

39:05.160 --> 39:06.160
We said we'd go.

39:06.240 --> 39:07.480
Oh, yes, so we did. Yeah.

39:07.560 --> 39:09.280
Might do us good.
Clear the heads.

39:10.440 --> 39:11.440
OK.

39:13.360 --> 39:16.280
Right, lads, keep at it.
Thank you.

39:16.360 --> 39:17.360
Sir.

39:19.160 --> 39:20.240
OK.

39:26.920 --> 39:28.840
You know what, JP?

39:28.920 --> 39:30.920
I think you're right,
you know.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.480
I think maybe Catherine
is the best woman for the job.

39:35.400 --> 39:37.760
We can't have Peter Baxter
running our island.

39:37.840 --> 39:40.280
(SCOFFS) Well, there's nothing
we can do about
it now, Dwayne.

39:40.360 --> 39:42.920
When they hold the election,
he'll probably win,

39:43.000 --> 39:45.600
just because of
the damage he's done
to Catherine's reputation.

39:45.680 --> 39:48.600
Well then maybe someone
should level
the playing field.

39:48.680 --> 39:50.160
What do you mean?

39:50.240 --> 39:51.760
Where are those images of him
and Verity Browning?

39:56.400 --> 39:58.320
Here.

39:58.400 --> 40:00.360
What are you
going to do with them?

40:00.440 --> 40:02.000
I'm going to see
how Peter Baxter

40:02.080 --> 40:03.560
likes being
played at his own game.

40:09.480 --> 40:14.840
I'd like us to begin
this prayer service
by singing hymn number 125.

40:15.520 --> 40:16.480

Florence,
I need you to come with me.

41:01.560 --> 41:03.240
Storage cupboard.

41:03.320 --> 41:04.880
Polling booths. OK.

41:07.400 --> 41:08.560
Ballot box.

41:11.960 --> 41:13.960
Florence, would you mind
doing me a favour?

41:14.040 --> 41:16.400
Could you go and
stand in the booth
Victor was in.

41:16.480 --> 41:19.600
Now, the fan wasn't working.

41:19.680 --> 41:21.520
There was no pen in that booth

41:21.600 --> 41:24.840
and Reverend Dawson
handed Victor one.

41:24.920 --> 41:27.080
Right. Catherine was in here,

41:27.160 --> 41:29.640
and his legs visible there,

41:29.720 --> 41:31.560
and that's when
Victor was stabbed.

41:38.160 --> 41:40.360
Excuse me?
There's no pen in this booth.

41:40.440 --> 41:42.040
I went and handed it to him.

41:44.240 --> 41:46.760
I'm sure I put one in there.

41:46.840 --> 41:48.720
KEMAR:
That only leaves one person.

41:49.560 --> 41:51.160
Catherine Bordey.

41:51.240 --> 41:53.640
She could have leaned out
and stabbed him then.

41:53.720 --> 41:56.040
Fight fire with
fire is what I say.

41:56.120 --> 41:58.120
(MUTTERING)

42:01.480 --> 42:03.440
It couldn't be, could it?

42:04.560 --> 42:06.240
It's a stretch.

42:06.320 --> 42:08.200
It's the only
thing that explains it.

42:08.280 --> 42:09.680
Explains what?

42:09.760 --> 42:11.960
The how and maybe the who.

42:12.040 --> 42:13.280
I think we might
have to curtail,

42:13.360 --> 42:15.080
Reverend Dawson's prayer
service a little.

42:15.160 --> 42:17.800
If I go and do that,
will you nip off
to the orphanage?

42:17.880 --> 42:19.160
There's something
I'd like you to find.

42:19.240 --> 42:20.720
Yes, sir.

42:20.800 --> 42:21.880
What?

42:21.960 --> 42:22.920
A long lost secret.

42:31.920 --> 42:33.120
Siobhan,
what are you doing here?

42:33.200 --> 42:34.360
I called the station.

42:34.440 --> 42:35.600
JP said you were
heading this way.

42:35.680 --> 42:36.800
Right, I see.

42:36.880 --> 42:38.400
I wanted to talk to you.

42:38.480 --> 42:40.040
I've been thinking
about what you said

42:40.120 --> 42:41.720
about staying
here permanently.

42:41.800 --> 42:43.840
-OK.
-And I think we should.

42:43.920 --> 42:45.520
Really?

42:45.600 --> 42:48.680
I've been thinking
over it in my head
and I think,

42:48.760 --> 42:51.320
I think mum would have
really liked it here.

42:51.400 --> 42:53.560
And that kind of
makes me happy, so,

42:53.640 --> 42:56.120
yeah, I think we should stay.

42:56.200 --> 42:58.920
That's just great.
That's brilliant news.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.320
I think we should go celebrate
and let everyone know,

43:01.400 --> 43:03.640
but there's
something I really need
to go and do first.

43:03.720 --> 43:05.400
-What's that?
-(SIGHS)

43:05.480 --> 43:06.600
Catch a killer.

43:09.720 --> 43:13.680
Two days ago,
at 10:00 in the morning,

43:13.760 --> 43:18.000
polling opened
for the election
of Saint Marie's next mayor.

43:18.080 --> 43:22.400
Only a minute later,
one of the three
candidates had been murdered.

43:22.480 --> 43:26.520
A knife thrust
viciously into his back
while he was casting his vote.

43:26.600 --> 43:31.280
Which left us asking
not just who did it, and why,

43:31.360 --> 43:33.200
but how did they
manage to do it?

43:33.280 --> 43:36.440
There were six other people
in the Community
Centre that day.

43:36.520 --> 43:38.840
All of you,
apart from Catherine,

43:38.920 --> 43:40.880
were able to
provide an alibi for the

43:40.960 --> 43:43.280
time at which Victor
Pearce was stabbed.

43:43.360 --> 43:45.520
Reverend Dawson,
you were at your desk,

43:45.600 --> 43:48.920
Mr Pearce and Mr Baxter
were in their
respective booths,

43:49.000 --> 43:51.320
Ms Bousquet, you had gone
to the store room,

43:51.400 --> 43:53.800
and Mrs Dawson,
you were just outside it.

43:53.880 --> 43:55.960
And all of you
had one other person

43:56.040 --> 43:59.920
who could vouch
for where you were
at the time of the murder.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.800
Whereas Catherine here,
not only had no alibi,

44:02.880 --> 44:05.480
she also had the means
of committing the murder

44:05.560 --> 44:07.520
being in the booth
right next to the victim.

44:09.080 --> 44:11.320
But it wasn't Catherine
who killed Victor Pearce.

44:12.160 --> 44:13.480
EDWINA: Then who was it?

44:13.560 --> 44:15.720
Ah, straight to the point,
Ms Bousquet.

44:15.800 --> 44:17.520
You know I like
that about you.

44:17.600 --> 44:19.760
I appreciate your directness.
Thank you.

44:19.840 --> 44:21.240
And,
in answer to your question...

44:22.560 --> 44:23.760
It was you.

44:26.440 --> 44:28.040
You murdered Victor Pearce.

44:29.760 --> 44:31.280
Don't be absurd,

44:31.360 --> 44:32.800
how could I have done it?

44:32.880 --> 44:35.040
I was in the store
room the whole time.

44:35.120 --> 44:37.280
Judith will vouch
for me, won't you?

44:37.360 --> 44:39.280
I'm sure she will.

44:39.360 --> 44:41.080
Because here's the thing.

44:41.160 --> 44:43.120
She was in cahoots with you.

44:43.200 --> 44:44.480
Your accomplice.

44:44.560 --> 44:46.680
-Isn't that right, Judith?
-No!

44:46.760 --> 44:48.800
This is ridiculous, Inspector.

44:48.880 --> 44:51.040
Do you really
think Edwina and Judith

44:51.120 --> 44:53.360
plotted together to
kill Victor Pearce?

44:53.440 --> 44:55.880
I do, Reverend, yeah. Sorry.

44:55.960 --> 44:59.200
But let me just run past you
what I think
happened that day.

44:59.280 --> 45:01.920
On the morning of the murder,
two things occurred.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.640
A fan stopped working
and a pen went missing.

45:04.720 --> 45:06.960
Now, was all this just chance?

45:07.040 --> 45:08.760
Or was it all part
of a bigger plan?

45:08.840 --> 45:11.440
The night before the election
was due to take place,

45:11.520 --> 45:14.960
we know
Reverend and Mrs Dawson
spent the evening

45:15.040 --> 45:17.520
preparing the Community Centre
for polling.

45:17.600 --> 45:19.960
But while you were there,
Mrs Dawson,

45:20.040 --> 45:21.760
I think you laid
the ground for what

45:21.840 --> 45:24.000
was to take place
the next morning.

45:24.080 --> 45:28.760
First, you made sure the fan
on Edwina's
desk wouldn't work.

45:28.840 --> 45:31.800
Two, when you were putting out
the pens in
the polling booths,

45:31.880 --> 45:35.080
you made sure that
one of the booths
near to the desk marked Honore

45:35.160 --> 45:36.960
didn't have a pen in it.

45:37.040 --> 45:39.800
Then thirdly, we assumed
that you planted the knife

45:39.880 --> 45:43.720
which was later
used to kill Victor
somewhere in the store room.

45:43.800 --> 45:46.560
That done,
everything was in place.

45:46.640 --> 45:50.720
You, and you, were both ready
to commit murder.

45:50.800 --> 45:54.400
You knew exactly which desk
Victor Pearce would go to

45:54.480 --> 45:56.280
to collect his ballot paper.

45:57.240 --> 45:58.320
Like Catherine,

45:58.400 --> 46:00.120
he's an Honore resident.

46:00.200 --> 46:02.240
So, he would go to the desk
Matthew was manning.

46:02.320 --> 46:05.240
Victor Pearce,
14 rue des Tyrans.

46:05.320 --> 46:08.640
Which is why you
removed the pen
from the booth that you did.

46:08.720 --> 46:10.160
And it was only
natural for Victor,

46:10.240 --> 46:11.560
when he arrived at
the polling station,

46:11.640 --> 46:13.040
to turn and walk
towards one of the

46:13.120 --> 46:14.920
booths on his
side of the room.

46:15.000 --> 46:18.720
So, you knew that Victor
would end up in one
of the two booths.

46:18.800 --> 46:21.400
It didn't really matter
which of the two he went in.

46:21.480 --> 46:23.920
All you needed was for him,
or Catherine,

46:24.000 --> 46:26.080
to ask Reverend
Dawson for a spare pen,

46:26.160 --> 46:28.360
so that he would
have to leave his desk.

46:28.440 --> 46:30.200
You see,

46:30.280 --> 46:32.400
when the candidates
started arriving
at the polling station,

46:32.480 --> 46:35.920
Ms Bousquet began her charade

46:36.000 --> 46:37.840
complaining that her
fan wasn't working,

46:37.920 --> 46:40.240
and supposedly go
into the store room
to fetch another one.

46:40.320 --> 46:43.800
I can't be expected
to sit in this heat
without a fan.

46:43.880 --> 46:47.200
And once there, I believe
that you recovered the knife,

46:47.280 --> 46:50.320
and at the same time,
you were still making a fuss

46:50.400 --> 46:52.680
saying that you couldn't find
what it was that
you were looking for.

46:52.760 --> 46:54.760
Where is the fan?

46:54.840 --> 46:59.440
Which then gave you, Judith,
an excuse to go and
help her to find it.

46:59.520 --> 47:01.880
She was struggling,
so I went to help.

47:01.960 --> 47:04.920
And then when
everybody had pulled
the curtains on their booths,

47:05.000 --> 47:07.480
Edwina,
I think you took that knife

47:07.560 --> 47:09.520
and you left
the store room and waited

47:09.600 --> 47:11.840
out of sight of
everybody else.

47:11.920 --> 47:14.240
Meanwhile, Judith,

47:14.320 --> 47:16.520
you pretended to
continue telling Edwina

47:16.600 --> 47:19.680
where she could find the fan
she was looking for,

47:19.760 --> 47:23.280
so that everyone would hear
and assume that's
what was happening.

47:23.360 --> 47:24.720
The fan is on the top shelf.

47:24.800 --> 47:26.000
JACK: When,
in fact, all you were doing

47:26.080 --> 47:27.520
was talking to
an empty store room.

47:27.600 --> 47:29.640
You could be heard,
but not seen,

47:29.720 --> 47:32.000
unlike at the church
when the opposite was true.

47:33.160 --> 47:34.880
At the same time,

47:34.960 --> 47:38.400
Victor was discovering
that he had no
pen in his booth.

47:38.480 --> 47:39.800
So, obviously,
he popped his head out

47:39.880 --> 47:41.720
and asked Reverend Dawson
to pass him one.

47:41.800 --> 47:44.240
Sorry.

47:44.320 --> 47:47.360
Which is when
you had your window
of opportunity to kill him.

47:50.800 --> 47:53.200
When Reverend Dawson
was walking back to his desk,

47:53.280 --> 47:55.400
his back to the room,

47:55.480 --> 47:58.280
you had a couple of seconds
to move swiftly
towards Victor's booth,

47:58.360 --> 48:00.440
lift the curtain and stab him.

48:03.600 --> 48:05.360
Stick that knife in his back

48:05.440 --> 48:07.920
unnoticed by
anybody else in the room.

48:08.000 --> 48:11.560
FLORENCE: All you had to do
was return to the store room,

48:11.640 --> 48:13.640
pick up the fan, and then

48:13.720 --> 48:15.800
wait for Victor's murder
to be discovered.

48:17.920 --> 48:19.200
Oh, my God!

48:20.040 --> 48:21.480
Dad?

48:21.560 --> 48:23.160
You assumed that
nobody would think

48:23.240 --> 48:24.960
it was anybody
else in the room.

48:25.040 --> 48:26.800
How could it be?

48:26.880 --> 48:29.560
You relied on these people
concluding that
it was an intruder

48:29.640 --> 48:32.160
who got in through
the front entrance.

48:32.240 --> 48:34.560
But what you didn't take
into consideration

48:34.640 --> 48:36.560
was that our Commissioner,

48:36.640 --> 48:38.520
in his infinite wisdom,
insisted

48:38.600 --> 48:40.520
on a police
presence that morning,

48:40.600 --> 48:42.200
which meant that
Officer Myers here

48:42.280 --> 48:44.560
was stationed
outside the building
the whole time

48:44.640 --> 48:47.520
bearing witness to
the fact that nobody

48:47.600 --> 48:52.280
came in or out of
the Community Centre
when Victor Pearce was killed.

48:52.360 --> 48:55.440
So, our murderer had to be
one of the six
people in the room.

48:55.520 --> 48:57.840
In the end, it could only be

48:57.920 --> 49:00.800
Judith Dawson or
Edwina Bousquet.

49:00.880 --> 49:02.320
More crucially,
one couldn't have

49:02.400 --> 49:04.000
done it without
the help of the other.

49:04.080 --> 49:07.800
But why? Why would
they do such a thing?

49:07.880 --> 49:09.560
You're right, Reverend,
it's a fair question.

49:09.640 --> 49:12.920
And one that had
me pretty stumped,
to be honest with you.

49:13.000 --> 49:16.440
Edwina, you said yourself,
that when Victor had hurt you,

49:16.520 --> 49:18.480
it was a long time ago.

49:18.560 --> 49:20.160
Didn't really
make sense for you

49:20.240 --> 49:22.800
to suddenly want the man dead
after all these years.

49:23.760 --> 49:25.400
But Judith,

49:25.480 --> 49:27.920
I think you had more reason
to want Victor Pearce killed.

49:29.040 --> 49:31.440
Despite running the orphanage,

49:31.520 --> 49:33.760
you were never
able to have children
yourself, were you?

49:33.840 --> 49:36.560
That's not to say that you
and Reverend
Dawson didn't try.

49:36.640 --> 49:38.160
I get
the impression that you both

49:38.240 --> 49:40.000
really wanted a family,
didn't you?

49:40.080 --> 49:42.320
It's never quite
happened for us.

49:42.400 --> 49:43.920
JACK: And bringing up
these three children

49:44.000 --> 49:45.480
in your care
these past few years,

49:45.560 --> 49:47.600
just you and your husband,

49:47.680 --> 49:49.080
I mean,
that's about as close as

49:49.160 --> 49:51.280
you can get to
having a proper family.

49:51.360 --> 49:54.280
And with Victor predicted
to win the election
and become mayor,

49:54.360 --> 49:55.680
I think there was
little doubt that

49:55.760 --> 49:57.680
he would've closed
down the orphanage,

49:57.760 --> 50:00.640
and those three
delightful children
that you loved

50:00.720 --> 50:03.280
would have been shipped off
to another island.

50:03.360 --> 50:04.760
I don't think you
could let that happen.

50:15.200 --> 50:17.000
Which brings us back
to the big question.

50:18.040 --> 50:20.000
Why kill Victor together?

50:20.080 --> 50:22.240
As I said, you couldn't
have done it alone

50:22.320 --> 50:23.880
without Ms Bousquet's help.

50:25.160 --> 50:27.160
But why would she help you,

50:27.240 --> 50:29.920
to kill the man
that she once loved?

50:30.000 --> 50:32.160
There had to be something
we were missing,

50:32.240 --> 50:34.120
something that
connected you both.

50:34.200 --> 50:37.480
Another motive,
something hidden,
something darker.

50:38.440 --> 50:40.280
And then it clicked.

50:40.360 --> 50:42.440
Judith,
you were an orphan here
yourself, weren't you?

50:42.520 --> 50:43.960
When you were a baby.

50:44.040 --> 50:45.880
That got me thinking.

50:45.960 --> 50:47.720
Your parents,
your mother and father,

50:47.800 --> 50:49.720
they must've been
here on the island
when you were born.

50:49.800 --> 50:51.640
But who were they?

50:51.720 --> 50:53.040
Who were these people?

50:54.240 --> 50:55.440
Mr Baxter,

50:55.520 --> 50:57.360
you told us about
a rumour you heard

50:57.440 --> 51:01.040
saying that Victor
Pearce had a daughter
that nobody knew about.

51:01.120 --> 51:03.320
I don't suppose
you happen to know
who she is, do you?

51:03.400 --> 51:05.400
No. I'd heard that
he got a girl pregnant,

51:05.480 --> 51:07.280
and wanted
nothing to do with her.

51:07.360 --> 51:09.080
That was about it.

51:09.160 --> 51:12.760
Well, we know of one girl he
abandoned already, don't we?

51:14.080 --> 51:15.520
Edwina,

51:15.600 --> 51:17.600
we know that
Victor broke your heart.

51:17.680 --> 51:19.160
You admitted as much.

51:19.240 --> 51:21.600
But what you
neglected to tell us

51:21.680 --> 51:23.960
was that
despite what you said,

51:24.040 --> 51:25.640
he didn't just
suddenly leave to go

51:25.720 --> 51:27.840
and start his own business,
did he?

51:27.920 --> 51:29.000
Something happened.

51:29.520 --> 51:30.960
He left

51:31.040 --> 51:34.040
because you were pregnant.

51:34.120 --> 51:37.840
And I assume you,
being in love with him
and a Christian woman,

51:37.920 --> 51:41.280
wanted to marry
and keep the baby.

51:41.360 --> 51:43.680
JACK:
But that's not how Victor
saw it, is it?

51:43.760 --> 51:45.680
He had a career to build.

51:45.760 --> 51:48.600
Edwina, I can only imagine
how difficult it was for you.

51:49.360 --> 51:51.600
The shame

51:51.680 --> 51:54.560
that a young girl
would be made to feel
in such a devout

51:54.640 --> 51:56.280
and strict religious home.

51:57.720 --> 52:01.280
Are you saying
Judith is Edwina's daughter?

52:01.360 --> 52:03.680
Yes. Yes, I am.

52:03.760 --> 52:05.160
And Victor
Pearce was her father.

52:09.520 --> 52:10.760
It's all in here.

52:14.760 --> 52:16.480
They are the original records.

52:19.200 --> 52:22.520
Which Judith was
perfectly placed
to keep hidden.

52:25.840 --> 52:28.320
I'm... I'm so sorry.

52:31.720 --> 52:33.400
Judith,

52:33.480 --> 52:37.240
I think you turned
to Edwina for help,
to your mother.

52:37.320 --> 52:39.720
She saw how
much those children
meant to you.

52:39.800 --> 52:42.600
She saw someone,
who like herself,
all those years ago,

52:42.680 --> 52:46.760
faced losing
the children that she loved
all because of Victor Pearce.

52:46.840 --> 52:50.120
History, as they say,
was repeating itself.

52:50.200 --> 52:51.480
And I think it
was then, Edwina,

52:51.560 --> 52:52.720
that you decided
to help Judith.

52:54.880 --> 52:57.800
With Victor's
impending election
as mayor, almost guaranteed,

52:57.880 --> 52:59.080
it had to be soon.

53:00.400 --> 53:01.800
But where and how?

53:04.080 --> 53:05.800
You said that Victor,
he was never one for

53:05.880 --> 53:07.520
meeting people that
he didn't have to.

53:07.600 --> 53:10.520
He was a hard man
to make an appointment with.

53:10.600 --> 53:13.480
JACK: So your
opportunity to commit murder,
it was limited.

53:13.560 --> 53:15.000
That's why you
chose polling day,

53:15.080 --> 53:17.600
the one day he
was sure to be here
in your parish

53:17.680 --> 53:21.320
giving you the limited chance
that you needed to kill him.

53:23.760 --> 53:27.680
That's why it happened,
when it did,
where it did, and how it did.

53:32.080 --> 53:33.640
I'm sorry we have to do this.

53:34.600 --> 53:36.800
Dwayne, JP,

53:36.880 --> 53:40.800
could you please
arrest Ms Bousquet
and Mrs Dawson.

54:21.080 --> 54:24.200
I'm not sure how
you worked it all out,

54:24.280 --> 54:26.440
but that was brilliant, sir.

54:26.520 --> 54:29.080
No, no, no, don't be silly.
It's team work.

54:29.160 --> 54:32.280
Well, we are very
lucky you were here.

54:32.360 --> 54:35.280
Right, so that's Mrs Dawson
and Ms Bousquet locked up.

54:35.360 --> 54:37.080
Yup.

54:37.160 --> 54:39.520
Good stuff.
Thank you, Dwayne, JP.

54:39.600 --> 54:41.920
Florence, are you OK
to finish up here?

54:42.000 --> 54:44.280
Of course, you wanna get home?

54:44.360 --> 54:46.400
Actually,
I need to pay a visit
to your Commissioner.

54:47.520 --> 54:50.440
Do you want to take the Jeep?

54:50.520 --> 54:53.640
Do you know what?
I fancy stretching my legs.

54:53.720 --> 54:55.200
See you later.
Catherine's bar.

55:56.720 --> 55:58.320
Well, this is very
good news, isn't it?

55:58.400 --> 56:01.880
Do we know what happened?
Peter Baxter just stood down?

56:01.960 --> 56:05.760
Well, sir,
apparently, he wants to spend
more time with the family.

56:05.840 --> 56:07.400
Really?

56:07.480 --> 56:09.320
And do we know
what prompted
this change of heart?

56:09.400 --> 56:10.520
No idea.

56:12.360 --> 56:14.320
Ah, Sarge.

56:14.400 --> 56:16.320
So, sir,
Siobhan just told me the news

56:16.400 --> 56:19.080
that you've decided
to stay here permanently.

56:19.160 --> 56:21.400
Yeah, we have indeed.
And you know what this means?

56:21.480 --> 56:24.160
Like it or not,
you're lumped with me.

56:24.240 --> 56:26.560
Well, I,
for one, am delighted, sir.

56:26.640 --> 56:28.440
-Me, too.
-Yes, me three, sir.

56:28.520 --> 56:29.520
And me.

56:30.320 --> 56:31.400
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

56:31.480 --> 56:33.320
(LAUGHING)

56:33.400 --> 56:35.520
Well,
I know I can overdo it a bit
on the toasting,

56:35.600 --> 56:38.360
but if ever
there was an occasion
to raise a glass,

56:38.440 --> 56:39.640
I think this is it.

56:39.720 --> 56:41.320
What do you say? To us.

56:41.400 --> 56:42.440
ALL: To us.

56:42.520 --> 56:43.560
To you.

56:43.640 --> 56:44.680
To me.

56:47.280 --> 56:48.600
Now,
if you don't mind, I think

56:48.680 --> 56:50.200
it's time for some world class
dad dancing.

56:50.280 --> 56:51.520
Siobhan, you're on.

57:04.200 --> 57:05.720
Madam Mayor.

57:33.760 --> 57:35.720
