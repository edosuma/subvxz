WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:07.383
-Hey.
-MAURA: Hi, guys.

00:07.425 --> 00:09.009
-JOSH: Hey, guys.
-Ooh, I don't like it.

00:09.051 --> 00:10.428
MAURA: Well, you don't
like the seeds. That's why.

00:10.469 --> 00:11.554
You could've gotten it
without the seeds.

00:11.595 --> 00:13.305
Oh, that's right.
I don't like seeds.

00:13.347 --> 00:14.890
-That's right. -Well,
why didn't you get the plain?

00:14.932 --> 00:16.308
But it looks like
it's got dirt on it.

00:16.350 --> 00:17.935
It's not dirt; it's spices.

00:17.977 --> 00:19.186
-(burps)
-LEN: Crank that AC, my man.

00:19.228 --> 00:21.856
-Yeah.
-Crank that AC up.

00:21.897 --> 00:23.357
-Full power AC.
-Did you get the street meat?

00:23.399 --> 00:24.942
-Dude, I had a lot of
street meat. -You did?

00:24.984 --> 00:26.402
I had a lot of street meat.

00:26.444 --> 00:29.113
Now remember,
you have to dip the bread.

00:29.155 --> 00:31.615
You have to dip the bread
all the way into the spice

00:31.657 --> 00:33.033
or there's no point.

00:33.075 --> 00:34.326
Yeah, o-okay.

00:34.368 --> 00:35.953
I have never wanted
to marry bread,

00:35.995 --> 00:37.747
but today I want to marry bread.

00:37.788 --> 00:39.415
MAURA: You could have
got the other kind.

00:39.457 --> 00:42.168
Moshe, Tapuz is
the next stop, right?

00:42.209 --> 00:43.586
-Yeah. Okay?
-Tapuz.

00:43.627 --> 00:45.921
Next stop, Tapuz.

00:45.963 --> 00:47.465
SHELLY: You've don't eat meat
on the street. What?

00:47.506 --> 00:49.884
(speaking Hebrew)

00:49.925 --> 00:53.012
(overlapping chatter)

00:53.053 --> 00:55.556
-LEN: It was like lamb.
-Everybody in?

00:55.598 --> 00:57.141
-Yes.
-Yeah. -Yeah.

00:57.183 --> 00:58.267
Okay.
(speaks Hebrew)

00:58.309 --> 01:00.686
Everyone sitting? Okay.

01:00.728 --> 01:02.605
SHELLY:
Andale.

01:02.646 --> 01:04.648
â™ª â™ª

01:33.928 --> 01:35.930
â™ª â™ª

02:05.251 --> 02:07.211
SHELLY: Ooh, we just passed
a sign to Bethlehem.

02:07.253 --> 02:10.047
BRYNA: Is Bethlehem
part of the West Bank?

02:10.089 --> 02:11.507
NITZAN:
Of course it is.

02:11.549 --> 02:13.467
MAURA: Oh, don't say,
"Of course it is," like that.

02:13.509 --> 02:15.553
It's where Jesus was born.
It's confusing.

02:15.594 --> 02:17.888
People don't know whether
it's Christian or Arab.

02:17.930 --> 02:19.306
NITZAN: Christians and Arabs
are not opposite.

02:19.348 --> 02:21.350
There are lots of
Christian Arabs, you know.

02:23.811 --> 02:26.272
MAURA: Who is this person
who lives in Tapuz?

02:26.313 --> 02:27.439
SARAH:
It's my friend's mom.

02:27.481 --> 02:28.899
MAURA:
Why are we stopping there?

02:28.941 --> 02:31.318
SARAH: We just have
to drop something off.

02:31.360 --> 02:33.237
NITZAN:
Okay, this is Tapuz.

02:36.574 --> 02:37.950
(Nitzan speaks Hebrew)

02:37.992 --> 02:39.952
(guard speaks Hebrew)

02:39.994 --> 02:41.537
Um, why are there soldiers here?

02:41.579 --> 02:44.957
(both speaking Hebrew)

02:44.999 --> 02:46.125
What's her name?

02:46.166 --> 02:48.168
-SARAH: Hadar Shalev.
-NITZAN: Hadar Shalev.

02:48.210 --> 02:49.545
-GUARD: Shalev.
-Number?

02:49.587 --> 02:51.088
SARAH:
Um, 1504.

02:51.130 --> 02:53.424
(Nitzan speaks Hebrew)
Okay.

02:53.465 --> 02:56.093
BRYNA: Wow.
Look at all the security.

02:56.135 --> 02:59.013
SHELLY:
Oy, such a big deal.

03:02.099 --> 03:03.642
ALI:
(sighs) Sarah.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.227
Do you know that
this is a settlement?

03:05.269 --> 03:06.604
JOSH: Um, how long
is this gonna take?

03:06.645 --> 03:08.564
Oh, my God, it's gonna take,
like, five minutes, okay?

03:08.606 --> 03:10.232
We're just dropping
something off.

03:11.734 --> 03:15.738
-God. -SHELLY: Looks
just like Park La Brea.

03:19.950 --> 03:20.951
SARAH:
Thanks.

03:20.993 --> 03:22.161
It's-it's over there.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.829
-Okay.
-Thank you, sir.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.539
-Be right back.
-Thanks, guys.

03:25.581 --> 03:27.583
All right, we got to be quick.

03:27.625 --> 03:29.293
Fucking Ali's on a warpath.

03:29.335 --> 03:32.212
-Thank you.
-Right over there.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.511
(knock on door)

03:40.554 --> 03:42.097
Shalom.

03:42.139 --> 03:43.265
-Shalom.
-Hadar?

03:43.307 --> 03:44.600
(Hadar speaks Hebrew)

03:44.642 --> 03:46.268
-Ah, yes.
-(speaks Hebrew)

03:46.310 --> 03:48.520
-Wow. -Oh, my God,
you're so beautiful.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.689
God bless you. You know,
you're taking care of Lila.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.816
You know, she told me
so much about you.

03:52.858 --> 03:56.111
-You know, thank you.
-Really? What-what did she say?

03:56.153 --> 03:57.947
Like, you know,
you were family for her

03:57.988 --> 04:00.324
-and I'm so happy for that,
really. -Oh. -Oh. Yeah.

04:00.366 --> 04:02.284
-Please, come in. -Oh, this...
-We can't stay. We can't stay.

04:02.326 --> 04:03.577
-We have a-a sweater.
-But thank you.

04:03.619 --> 04:05.663
-Oh, sweater.
-Yeah, yeah, she...

04:05.704 --> 04:06.914
She's still knitting.

04:06.956 --> 04:08.916
Who will marry her?
Please, please, come.

04:08.958 --> 04:10.000
-Oh, actually, we can't.
-We can't.

04:10.042 --> 04:11.168
-We actually can't stay
for very long. -Please.

04:11.210 --> 04:12.461
Well, no, we can stay for five.

04:12.503 --> 04:14.088
-We can stay for a little.
I'm sorry, yeah. -Yay!

04:14.129 --> 04:15.923
HADAR:
I'm making lemon bars for Lila.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.596
(grunting)

04:24.807 --> 04:27.059
BRYNA:
Ugh, I got to pee.

04:27.101 --> 04:29.853
SHELLY: Oh, God.
I haven't done my steps.

04:29.895 --> 04:32.022
Who is this friend?
This-this-this Hagar?

04:32.064 --> 04:33.273
JOSH:
It's Hadar.

04:33.315 --> 04:35.359
It's Hadar with a "D."

04:35.401 --> 04:36.860
Do you remember that cartoon?

04:36.902 --> 04:38.237
Hagar the Horrible.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.280
-Fat guy.
-I remember Babar.

04:40.322 --> 04:41.323
Babar the Borrible.

04:41.365 --> 04:43.200
-That's good. Good one.
-SHELLY: You know what?

04:43.242 --> 04:45.995
Hagar was from the Torah.

04:46.036 --> 04:47.621
Everything here
is from the Torah.

04:47.663 --> 04:50.165
-We're in Israel.
-SHELLY: Sarah and Hagar

04:50.207 --> 04:52.960
were both Abraham's lovers.

04:53.002 --> 04:56.922
And Sarah was his wife
and Hagar was the handmaiden.

04:56.964 --> 05:01.260
Sarah begat Isaac,
and he's the father of the Jews

05:01.301 --> 05:03.470
-and Hagar begat Ishmael...
-BRYNA: Begat.

05:03.512 --> 05:05.139
...and he was the father
of the Islams.

05:05.180 --> 05:07.141
And that's why
we're still fighting.

05:07.182 --> 05:09.935
-Now, Ishmael is Moby Dick.
-JOSH: Thank you.

05:09.977 --> 05:13.063
Mohammed invented Islam.

05:13.105 --> 05:16.066
-SHELLY: No. Oh, no. -Mom,
you have zero facts correct

05:16.108 --> 05:18.402
in this whole situation.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.283
Ay-eesh.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.743
BRYNA:
Nice breeze.

05:25.784 --> 05:28.912
(Shelly sighs, scoffs)

05:28.954 --> 05:32.833
This is not how I planned to
spend my time in the Holy Land.

05:32.875 --> 05:36.128
I'm going up there.

05:36.170 --> 05:37.463
-I'll come with you.
-â™ª â™ª

05:37.504 --> 05:38.756
Maybe they have Fresca.

05:38.797 --> 05:40.466
SHELLY:
Yeah, Fresca would be good.

05:40.507 --> 05:42.843
-BRYNA: It would... with ice.
-(knocks on door)

05:42.885 --> 05:47.139
-Shalom.
-Shalom. I'm Sarah's mother.

05:47.181 --> 05:48.682
-Oh, wow.
-Could we come in and tinkle?

05:48.724 --> 05:51.810
-(Hadar speaking Hebrew)
-Pish, pish. -Pee-pee.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.604
-(speaks Hebrew) -Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

05:53.645 --> 05:55.522
-Hi, welcome.
-Do you have Fresca?

05:55.564 --> 05:57.941
(speaks Hebrew) Fresca?

05:57.983 --> 05:59.985
â™ª â™ª

06:07.409 --> 06:11.246
Um, I want to go.

06:12.289 --> 06:14.541
Where do you want to go?

06:14.583 --> 06:16.668
I just-- I don't want
to be here, okay?

06:16.710 --> 06:19.338
I don't want to be
on this stolen land.

06:20.756 --> 06:22.174
Lyfe and her friends
are 20 minutes away.

06:22.216 --> 06:24.343
I can take a cab there.
I want to go.

06:24.384 --> 06:27.346
Do you want to get into
a Palestinian taxi?

06:27.387 --> 06:31.016
-I've been in a Palestinian
taxi, it's fine. -JOSH: Wait.

06:31.058 --> 06:33.727
You're-you're gonna leave?
You're gonna leave the trip?

06:33.769 --> 06:36.230
ALI: It's not a big deal.
I'll find you guys later.

06:36.271 --> 06:39.775
Okay. Just chill
for a second, okay?

06:39.817 --> 06:41.777
I'm gonna get these fucking
jamochas out of here.

06:41.819 --> 06:43.570
All right? Give me a second.

06:43.612 --> 06:45.823
ALI: (groans)
It's not a big deal.

06:45.864 --> 06:48.992
You know, the West Bank
is not safe for a woman alone.

06:49.034 --> 06:50.369
I, for one,
wouldn't allow my daughter

06:50.410 --> 06:51.829
-to go traipsing around there.
-MAURA: All right.

06:51.870 --> 06:54.581
-It is not safe. -All right.
-First of all,

06:54.623 --> 06:55.874
please don't call me a woman.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.626
I don't want to be part of
your weird fucked-up math.

06:57.668 --> 06:59.461
Okay? Because I have a vagina,
I'm gonna get raped;

06:59.503 --> 07:01.255
because I have a vagina,
I'm not safe.

07:01.296 --> 07:02.881
-(scoffs) -Would you tell Josh
not to go in the West Bank?

07:02.923 --> 07:05.676
-Okay, okay, okay. -It's like
when I was at the dentist

07:05.717 --> 07:07.427
as a kid at Dr. Schulruff's,
and you'd go to the bathroom

07:07.469 --> 07:09.263
and there would be a ruler
with a key for the girls' room,

07:09.304 --> 07:10.848
but the boys' room
didn't have a key.

07:10.889 --> 07:13.559
Boy, this one's angry.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.185
(scoffs)

07:21.441 --> 07:23.902
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.238
I don't know, I just--
I don't, I don't feel right.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.198
I don't feel good.

07:31.326 --> 07:33.745
I understand.

07:35.455 --> 07:39.418
I felt that way.

07:39.459 --> 07:42.337
Agitated.

07:42.379 --> 07:44.423
I'd be invited places.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.383
I didn't know
if I would show up,

07:46.425 --> 07:49.511
I didn't know...
if someone else.

07:49.553 --> 07:51.972
I understand.

07:54.433 --> 07:58.478
I just don't feel good
in my body.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.647
I don't feel...

08:00.689 --> 08:03.150
Just, I don't feel in my body.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.748
Do you think you're trans?

08:20.584 --> 08:24.046
(scoffs)
I... I...

08:26.006 --> 08:28.133
I don't know.

08:32.471 --> 08:34.890
I don't know that I...

08:34.932 --> 08:37.351
feel like a woman.

08:37.392 --> 08:39.770
Whatever that means.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.944
-(sighs)
-Go.

08:50.530 --> 08:51.949
Go.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.876
(whispers):
Thank you.

09:09.007 --> 09:10.550
HADAR:
This is Lila

09:10.592 --> 09:11.885
-when she was five-years-old,
huh? Look. -Oh, wow.

09:11.927 --> 09:13.303
-Oh...
-Oh, she's gorgeous.

09:13.345 --> 09:15.889
-Look, huh? It's in the park.
-So cute, adorable.

09:15.931 --> 09:17.849
-Oh, she looks like Raggedy Ann.
-In Avdat.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.309
SHELLY: She's prettier than
Raggedy Ann. Lips are so dry.

09:19.351 --> 09:20.811
BRYNA: You were so young
when you had her.

09:20.852 --> 09:22.104
Wait. I smell something burning.
What's burning?

09:22.145 --> 09:23.522
-Oh, my God.
-Wait a minute.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.942
-What's burning?
-The lemon things.

09:26.984 --> 09:28.860
-Oh, my God, it's burning.
It's burning. -Oh.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.612
-How old is she?
-(indistinct chatter)

09:30.654 --> 09:32.406
I don't know.
She's, like, our age, right?

09:32.447 --> 09:34.116
Seriously? Oh, my God.

09:34.157 --> 09:36.576
So we could totally be,
like, Lila's parents?

09:36.618 --> 09:37.828
SHELLY:
They're all burning.

09:37.869 --> 09:39.204
-Oh, God.
-(overlapping chatter)

09:39.246 --> 09:40.914
-(knocking on door) -All right.
Oh, they look awful.

09:40.956 --> 09:42.416
-Someone's at the door. -SHELLY:
We're not gonna eat them.

09:42.457 --> 09:43.834
-It's carcinogenic! We're not
gonna do it. -(knocking)

09:43.875 --> 09:45.294
-Someone's at the door!
-Okay, just get it then.

09:45.335 --> 09:46.586
-I'll get it.
-SHELLY: Someone's at the door!

09:46.628 --> 09:48.171
-You have two legs, Len.
-LEN: I'm gonna get the door.

09:48.213 --> 09:50.507
-I've seen them.
-Hey, man. Sorry.

09:50.549 --> 09:52.551
-(smoke alarm beeping) -We got
to go. Sarah, we got to go!

09:52.592 --> 09:54.511
-Oh, my God! -BRYNA: See, I told
you the alarm would go off.

09:54.553 --> 09:56.096
-LEN: We can't go right now.
-JOSH: What's going on?

09:56.138 --> 09:58.181
It's kind of
a delicate situation.

09:58.223 --> 10:00.017
Ali is literally walking
to the West Bank

10:00.058 --> 10:01.852
-or some shit. Can we go?
-(excited chatter)

10:01.893 --> 10:03.562
-Sarah, why are we even here?
-LEN: You're being

10:03.603 --> 10:04.980
-very rude, dude.
-Sarah, let's go. -All right.

10:05.022 --> 10:06.398
We'll be right there.
Just give me a minute.

10:06.440 --> 10:07.816
Let's not yell.
This is someone's house.

10:07.858 --> 10:09.359
-This is someone's house. Come
here, come here. -Okay, it's...

10:09.401 --> 10:10.861
-Fucking mayhem in there.
-Dude, dude, dude, dude.

10:10.902 --> 10:12.696
-Come here, come here, come
here. Look. -What the fuck?

10:12.738 --> 10:14.489
-It's a kind of a delicate
situation, man. -Oh.

10:14.531 --> 10:15.991
You know what
a delicate situation is,

10:16.033 --> 10:18.577
is my sister's out there
wandering around Gaza

10:18.618 --> 10:21.079
while you guys are in here
getting muffins from who?

10:21.121 --> 10:22.789
-Who is this person?
-It's Lila's mom.

10:22.831 --> 10:24.583
It was Ella's preschool teacher.

10:24.624 --> 10:27.502
The girl from
the sex addict meeting?

10:27.544 --> 10:29.588
Apparently,
she's barely a sex addict.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.089
-And she's cool, man.
-(laughing)

10:31.131 --> 10:33.175
Oh, she's a cool person.

10:33.216 --> 10:35.802
(alarm continues beeping)

10:35.844 --> 10:38.013
You guys are fucking her?

10:38.055 --> 10:40.390
(sighs)

10:40.432 --> 10:44.686
You're... that's fucked up.
That is fucked up, man!

10:44.728 --> 10:46.521
-Mom, we got to go. I'm sorry.
-SHELLY: We're coming.

10:46.563 --> 10:48.148
-Give us a minute.
-JOSH: That girl's, like,

10:48.190 --> 10:49.191
-half your age, dude.
-I-- we have to go.

10:49.232 --> 10:50.609
So lovely to meet you.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.694
-Please lower your voice. -What
the hell is going on out here?

10:52.736 --> 10:55.280
-JOSH: You know she's a sex
addict. They both are. -What?

10:55.322 --> 10:57.074
-And you're taking advantage of
them? -What are you talking...

10:57.115 --> 10:58.742
-That's fucked up. -Don't shove
me. -Hey! What are you,

10:58.784 --> 11:00.619
-shoving him? -Don't
shove him. I will shove him.

11:00.660 --> 11:01.787
-Please don't do that.
-That's bullshit, man.

11:01.828 --> 11:02.829
What are you talking about?!

11:02.871 --> 11:03.955
I'm not a fucking sex addict.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.374
Don't put your ish
all over me, Josh.

11:05.415 --> 11:07.584
What is... what is that?

11:07.626 --> 11:08.960
-Your issues. -You guys are...
-You have ish-oohs.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.837
-It's her term for issues.
-You met...

11:10.879 --> 11:12.589
at a sex addict meeting.

11:12.631 --> 11:14.883
So? So who else was
at the meeting, Josh?

11:14.925 --> 11:16.635
-Peakaboo, I am at the meeting.
-Who else was at the meeting?

11:16.676 --> 11:19.638
-Shame on you! -Ali was at the
meeting. Ali was at the meeting.

11:19.679 --> 11:20.847
-(overlapping arguing)
-Shame on you.

11:20.889 --> 11:22.599
I own my shit.
I said I'm a sex addict!

11:22.641 --> 11:23.975
-You don't shove people. -...to
the meeting in the first place,

11:24.017 --> 11:25.435
-you fuck face. -You don't
shove people in Israel.

11:25.477 --> 11:26.853
SARAH:
Really? Really?

11:26.895 --> 11:28.188
Jesus, what is...?
He's like... (groans)

11:28.230 --> 11:29.815
Hey, shove me again, man.

11:29.856 --> 11:32.067
-JOSH: Shut the fuck up.
-SARAH: Len, come on.

11:32.109 --> 11:33.652
-Fucking shove me again.
-Honey, honey, honey, stop.

11:33.693 --> 11:36.446
-Jesus Christ.
-Is she gone?

11:36.488 --> 11:38.990
-She went back.
-You want to know why?

11:39.032 --> 11:40.283
-Okay, can we not do this?
-You want to know why

11:40.325 --> 11:41.368
we're at this fucking
settlement?

11:41.410 --> 11:42.744
-Okay, dude...
-Can we please not do this?

11:42.786 --> 11:44.329
To exchange hugs
and-and baked goods

11:44.371 --> 11:46.957
with some mother of a person,

11:46.998 --> 11:48.625
some child-- how old is she?

11:48.667 --> 11:50.377
-How old is she?
-Why are you doing this?

11:50.419 --> 11:53.046
-What difference does that make?
-Please do not tell Mom

11:53.088 --> 11:54.297
-and Moppa everything.
-Tell us what?

11:54.339 --> 11:55.674
SARAH:
Oh, my God. Okay, fine.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.301
I will tell you.
I'm in trouble, as usual,

11:58.343 --> 12:00.595
because Len and I are having sex

12:00.637 --> 12:02.556
with a third person
in our relationship

12:02.597 --> 12:04.724
who is a young woman, and a...

12:04.766 --> 12:06.643
-a wonderful woman.
-LEN: She's a wonderful woman

12:06.685 --> 12:09.855
-who consented to everything.
-Yes. Consented, okay?

12:09.896 --> 12:12.607
She's a wonderful, smart,
incredible woman,

12:12.649 --> 12:14.693
and we have strong feelings.
We're in, like, NRE.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.153
Like, new relationship energy--
that's a term

12:16.194 --> 12:18.780
that we're...
Anyway, and I-I'm sorry,

12:18.822 --> 12:20.615
but, you know, her mother
happened to live in Israel,

12:20.657 --> 12:22.492
and we wanted to say hi to her,
and I didn't know

12:22.534 --> 12:24.035
this fucking place
was a fucking settlement.

12:24.077 --> 12:26.705
I thought "Tapuz" sounded
like some beautiful jewel

12:26.746 --> 12:28.206
or something, and I was wrong.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.250
Okay, I was wrong.

12:30.292 --> 12:31.835
So leave me the fuck alone.

12:43.180 --> 12:44.473
Okay, are we good?

12:48.852 --> 12:51.897
Let's get on the bus.

13:03.492 --> 13:05.869
Maybe now we can see my trees?

13:11.791 --> 13:15.086
â™ª â™ª

13:21.426 --> 13:25.138
("Fool's Gold"
by Yam Lo Moschech playing)

13:28.975 --> 13:31.311
(goat bleating)

13:31.353 --> 13:33.522
â™ª â™ª

13:37.943 --> 13:40.320
-Hi.
-Hello.

13:40.362 --> 13:42.155
Hey, Ali.

13:42.197 --> 13:44.574
GIRL:
Ali!

13:44.616 --> 13:46.785
LYFE:
Ali Pfefferman,

13:46.826 --> 13:49.037
you're back.
(speaks Hebrew)

13:49.079 --> 13:52.832
-Hi, handsome.
-(speaks Hebrew)

13:52.874 --> 13:55.835
HUSSEN: Sorry. I'm not familiar
with this cool guy.

13:55.877 --> 13:57.420
Wow, Ali, amazing story.

13:57.462 --> 13:59.214
(laughter)

13:59.256 --> 14:01.424
I don't know
if it's amazing exactly.

14:01.466 --> 14:04.052
JANAN: You know, if
my grandfather was still alive,

14:04.094 --> 14:06.805
he would be so happy
to see his house so full.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.181
(speaking Hebrew)

14:08.223 --> 14:12.018
(Janan speaks Hebrew)

14:12.060 --> 14:13.228
(continues speaking Hebrew)

14:13.270 --> 14:14.896
(laughter)

14:14.938 --> 14:16.648
-What's funny?
-I'm-I'm worried that

14:16.690 --> 14:18.191
her grandfather might have
been a little conservative.

14:18.233 --> 14:19.693
-Oh, and this crowd would be...
-Yes.

14:19.734 --> 14:21.069
I see. Occupying his land.

14:21.111 --> 14:23.363
JANAN: No, I think
he would still love it.

14:23.405 --> 14:25.532
-Progressive grandpa.
-Oh, my God.

14:25.574 --> 14:28.285
My grandpa.
(laughs)

14:33.415 --> 14:35.875
(bus hisses)

14:39.963 --> 14:41.214
(coughing)

14:41.256 --> 14:42.674
NITZAN:
We came on a good day.

14:42.716 --> 14:44.217
-It's not too busy.
-Ah.

14:44.259 --> 14:46.177
-Go ahead. -SARAH: Thank you.
-MAURA: It's very bright.

14:46.219 --> 14:47.470
JOSH:
Fuck. One of these Bedouins

14:47.512 --> 14:49.097
better be a chiropractor.

14:49.139 --> 14:51.016
-Thank you. -MAURA: Thank you.
-SHELLY: Yes. Thank you.

14:51.057 --> 14:52.309
SARAH:
Oh, this is so cute.

14:52.350 --> 14:53.643
BRYNA: You know,
I tasted one of those.

14:53.685 --> 14:55.103
SHELLY:
They're terrible, Bry.

14:55.145 --> 14:58.064
MOSHE: Now, this was started
by a friend of mine, Benjamin.

14:58.106 --> 15:00.066
It's a, uh, Bedouin village.

15:00.108 --> 15:01.484
JOSH:
So, these Bedouins are cool

15:01.526 --> 15:03.737
with us just, like,
crashing with them?

15:03.778 --> 15:05.071
NITZAN: They're not real
Bedouins. Real Bedouin camp,

15:05.113 --> 15:07.574
you don't want to visit.

15:07.616 --> 15:09.868
Traditional Bedouins
live off camel milk.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.370
MAURA: Wow. I've never been
more lactose intolerant.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.789
LEN:
Is camel milk kosher?

15:14.831 --> 15:16.291
SHELLY:
Do the camels bite?

15:16.333 --> 15:18.084
MOSHE:
No, but they do spit.

15:18.126 --> 15:20.712
-BRYNA: You want to ride one?
-SHELLY: But they look so sweet.

15:20.754 --> 15:22.172
Can we touch them?

15:22.213 --> 15:24.341
Yeah.

15:24.382 --> 15:25.592
Careful.

15:25.634 --> 15:27.969
SHELLY:
Hi, kids.

15:28.011 --> 15:30.639
NITZAN:
So, there's water inside.

15:30.680 --> 15:31.973
-Thank you.
-Aren't they nice-looking?

15:32.015 --> 15:33.224
Whoa, be careful. Be careful.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.476
SHELLY: (stammers)
They bite.

15:34.517 --> 15:35.935
-No. Easy.
-He's sweating.

15:35.977 --> 15:38.229
-He's hot.
-Yeah.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.737
(camel groans)

15:45.779 --> 15:48.990
-SHELLY: Hi. So, this
is the camel ride? -BRYNA: Yeah.

15:49.032 --> 15:50.909
-Can this thing go any faster?
-I don't know.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.369
-Driver?
-It's too dangerous.

15:52.410 --> 15:54.120
SHELLY: Can we get out
of the parking lot?

15:54.162 --> 15:55.497
-BRYNA: He's not the driver.
-He is the driver.

15:55.538 --> 15:56.956
He's the camel driver.

15:56.998 --> 15:59.000
-We'll pay you to leave
the parking lot. -Yeah.

15:59.042 --> 16:00.251
-A lot.
-No?

16:00.293 --> 16:01.920
Name your price.
Maybe you could take us

16:01.961 --> 16:04.422
to see the Tomb
of the Matriarchs?

16:04.464 --> 16:06.633
Or-or Mary Magdalene?
I've always...

16:06.675 --> 16:08.968
-Wasn't she a-a prostitute?
-No, no, they made that up.

16:09.010 --> 16:11.721
-Oh, they did. Okay. But she...
-Yeah. It's those apostles.

16:11.763 --> 16:13.431
-I think she washed his feet.
-That's that song.

16:13.473 --> 16:14.933
â™ª I don't know â™ª

16:14.974 --> 16:17.977
BOTH:
â™ª How to love him â™ª

16:18.019 --> 16:19.896
â™ª What to do â™ª

16:19.938 --> 16:22.065
-â™ª How to move him â™ª
-(camel grunts)

16:22.107 --> 16:23.608
-He's singing with us.
-â™ª He's a man â™ª

16:23.650 --> 16:24.984
(both laugh)

16:25.026 --> 16:26.861
BOTH:
â™ª He's just a man. â™ª

16:26.903 --> 16:27.904
CHILD:
Ha!

16:27.946 --> 16:30.407
â™ª Ha, ah, ha â™ª

16:30.448 --> 16:32.992
â™ª Ha, ah,
ha â™ª

16:33.034 --> 16:35.787
â™ª Ha, ah, ha â™ª

16:35.829 --> 16:38.581
â™ª Ha, ah,
ha â™ª

16:38.623 --> 16:40.542
(all laughing)

16:41.626 --> 16:42.711
My joke is not funny.

16:42.752 --> 16:44.087
-Okay. -Tell it.
-Well, let's hear it.

16:44.129 --> 16:45.463
ALI: I usually do this
with a Russian accent, but...

16:45.505 --> 16:46.589
-Tell your joke.
-Okay.

16:46.631 --> 16:48.425
A grasshopper walks into a bar

16:48.466 --> 16:49.926
and says to the bartend...

16:49.968 --> 16:51.594
No, no, no.
And the bartender says to him,

16:51.636 --> 16:53.346
"Ah, we have a drink
named after you."

16:53.388 --> 16:54.806
And the grasshopper says,

16:54.848 --> 16:56.641
"Oh, really?
You have a drink named Shlomo?"

16:58.184 --> 17:00.186
(laughs)

17:00.228 --> 17:02.939
It's funny if you've ever
had a grasshopper.

17:02.981 --> 17:04.733
It's a drink.

17:04.774 --> 17:06.151
(all laughing)

17:19.456 --> 17:22.375
-(laughter) -Don't quit
your day job, Pfefferman.

17:22.417 --> 17:23.710
What day job?

17:23.752 --> 17:25.128
(all laughing)

17:29.174 --> 17:31.092
JOSH:
So, it's cool

17:31.134 --> 17:33.511
for Ali to just be AWOL
right now?

17:33.553 --> 17:35.680
I mean, if I knew
we could get a hall pass,

17:35.722 --> 17:37.807
I'd-I'd be clubbing
in Bethlehem.

17:40.018 --> 17:44.898
No one interested in a
traditional Bedouin dinner? Hmm?

17:47.817 --> 17:50.779
What is a traditional
Bedouin dinner?

17:50.820 --> 17:53.865
(scoffs)

17:53.907 --> 17:56.034
â™ª What you believe â™ª

18:00.663 --> 18:03.082
â™ª You give and receive â™ª

18:03.124 --> 18:05.668
(chuckles)

18:05.710 --> 18:07.670
What about the little tent
down there,

18:07.712 --> 18:08.922
is someone there?

18:08.963 --> 18:10.465
No.

18:10.507 --> 18:12.091
You know what, let's do
the greenhouse over there.

18:12.133 --> 18:14.052
-The greenhouse?
-Yeah.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.345
Okay.

18:15.386 --> 18:16.763
(laughs)

18:16.805 --> 18:18.890
â™ª And ask no questions why â™ª

18:18.932 --> 18:20.809
Here.

18:20.850 --> 18:22.060
You got it.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.687
â™ª You just slip slide on by â™ª

18:28.483 --> 18:30.693
â™ª You slip slide on by â™ª

18:32.695 --> 18:34.864
(moans)

18:35.907 --> 18:39.452
Take it off.

18:40.495 --> 18:42.455
No, not that.

18:42.497 --> 18:45.375
I don't take this off.

18:53.591 --> 18:55.510
Can I take this off?

18:55.552 --> 18:58.179
Yeah.

18:58.221 --> 19:00.223
Um... (chuckles nervously)

19:01.516 --> 19:03.226
Maybe not.

19:03.268 --> 19:06.604
Or, I mean, unless you feel like
you need to touch my tits, or...

19:06.646 --> 19:08.356
What do you want to do?

19:08.398 --> 19:09.983
(laughs)

19:10.024 --> 19:11.359
I don't know.

19:11.401 --> 19:13.069
I'm sorry. Sorry.

19:13.111 --> 19:14.988
(sighs) Sorry.

19:15.029 --> 19:16.948
-No problem.
-I just...

19:16.990 --> 19:18.408
Take your time.

19:18.449 --> 19:19.659
Okay.

19:19.701 --> 19:20.910
It just never occurred to me

19:20.952 --> 19:22.495
that I could not take this off.

19:22.537 --> 19:25.039
I mean, that's literally
never occurred to me before.

19:25.081 --> 19:26.332
And, I mean, yeah, I'd love

19:26.374 --> 19:27.792
to try having sex
without breasts.

19:27.834 --> 19:31.170
But I don't know
what that means.

19:33.172 --> 19:37.051
How did you... um,

19:37.093 --> 19:38.928
figure this out?

19:38.970 --> 19:41.014
I mean, when did you

19:41.055 --> 19:43.850
make the decision
that you were gonna...

19:43.892 --> 19:47.729
not take your binder off
during sex?

19:47.770 --> 19:49.647
Moments like this.

19:49.689 --> 19:52.275
Just exploring.

19:52.317 --> 19:54.819
Trial, error.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.195
Adventure.

19:57.947 --> 20:00.199
Yeah.

20:00.241 --> 20:02.577
So, what's the dynamic for you?

20:02.619 --> 20:04.245
Are-are you always...

20:04.287 --> 20:07.624
the guy, and you're always
having sex with the girl?

20:07.665 --> 20:10.168
I'm just a human person.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.462
And I just want to be a body.

20:12.503 --> 20:16.257
I can do what bodies do.

20:16.299 --> 20:18.217
What do bodies do?

20:18.259 --> 20:21.429
I think they sometimes do this.

20:26.601 --> 20:29.604
Okay, but by "bodies,"
you don't mean 69, right?

20:29.646 --> 20:32.565
'Cause I just got to say,
I hate 69.

20:32.607 --> 20:34.233
I don't like it. I don't get it.

20:34.275 --> 20:36.778
The only reason
I think it's successful

20:36.819 --> 20:38.154
is because
it has great branding.

20:38.196 --> 20:39.530
-(laughs) -It's just because
the numbers are so cute.

20:39.572 --> 20:40.949
And if it wasn't a six
and a nine,

20:40.990 --> 20:43.576
it would have died
a long time ago.

20:43.618 --> 20:44.911
I mean, it's just too much.

20:44.953 --> 20:47.497
Who can multitask
like that, right?

20:47.538 --> 20:50.583
Actually, I'm very good
at multitasking.

20:50.625 --> 20:54.545
But, hey,
we don't have to have sex.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.172
I'm sorry.

20:56.214 --> 20:58.716
This has just been
a really weird day for me.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.093
Fuck.

21:00.134 --> 21:03.346
â™ª How long must we live right â™ª

21:03.388 --> 21:07.350
â™ª Before we don't even
have to try? â™ª

21:09.560 --> 21:11.604
(vocalizing)

21:13.314 --> 21:15.817
(vocalizing)

21:15.858 --> 21:18.569
â™ª Note from your daughter â™ª

21:21.114 --> 21:24.826
â™ª Drawing of three flowers â™ª

21:27.370 --> 21:32.291
â™ª I still keep it with me â™ª

21:34.836 --> 21:39.090
â™ª Does she still want to sing? â™ª

21:43.094 --> 21:47.265
â™ª How long must we live right â™ª

21:47.306 --> 21:50.643
â™ª Before we don't even
have to try? â™ª

21:52.687 --> 21:54.689
(vocalizing)

21:56.399 --> 21:58.609
(music fades)
