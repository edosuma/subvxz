00:08.842 --> 00:11.511
In this episode,
we're traveling up the Hudson River

00:11.594 --> 00:14.097
to the beautiful historic town
of Hudson, New York.

00:14.180 --> 00:15.765
This is spectacular.

00:15.849 --> 00:18.685
Where our property owner
desperately needs our help.

00:18.768 --> 00:20.937
This place is a money pit.

00:21.021 --> 00:23.815
We'll show this first-timer
how to launch a short-term rental.

00:23.898 --> 00:25.233
I'm ready.

00:25.316 --> 00:27.527
From how to wow your guests
with great design...

00:27.610 --> 00:29.237
This is so cool.

00:29.320 --> 00:30.905
To high-tech marketing.

00:30.989 --> 00:32.115
-Drones.
-We like drones.

00:32.198 --> 00:34.242
-I love drones.
-Awesome!

00:34.617 --> 00:36.077
And unique experiences.

00:37.370 --> 00:38.997
Welcome to our farm tour.

00:39.080 --> 00:41.833
We'll transform
this classic carriage house...

00:41.916 --> 00:44.127
This is my bedroom, living room area.

00:44.210 --> 00:45.420
...into a moneymaker.

00:45.503 --> 00:48.131
-You've got a diamond here, mate.
-Guys, this is incredible.

00:50.000 --> 00:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:14.407 --> 01:16.701
-This is spectacular.
-Isn't this major?

01:16.785 --> 01:20.038
-I think it's absolutely gorgeous.
-Welcome to Hudson!

01:20.497 --> 01:23.249
This is, as New Yorkers,
what we need the most.

01:23.333 --> 01:24.459
We need nature.

01:30.215 --> 01:34.886
I'm so glad you brought me. I had no clue.
We just got off the train.

01:34.969 --> 01:36.638
You don't need a car in Hudson.

01:36.721 --> 01:42.310
Two hours from bustling Manhattan
to this cradle of beauty.

01:42.393 --> 01:46.147
With, like, every single American
architecture style

01:46.231 --> 01:49.484
in one tiny little town of 6,000 people.

01:49.567 --> 01:50.944
That's it.

01:51.027 --> 01:55.073
For many New Yorkers like me,
we just love Hudson

01:55.156 --> 01:58.201
because it's an easy two-hour
train ride from Manhattan.

01:58.284 --> 02:01.287
It's a very popular weekend getaway
for antique shoppers,

02:01.371 --> 02:04.332
art collectors, foodies, design lovers
like myself,

02:04.415 --> 02:07.877
which makes it the perfect place
to start a short-term rental

02:07.961 --> 02:11.256
In Hudson, there are 6,000 people,
yet an impressive collection

02:11.339 --> 02:14.008
of 199 vacation rentals.

02:14.092 --> 02:17.345
And they made a little over
$5 million last year.

02:19.097 --> 02:20.181
Okay.

02:21.975 --> 02:26.437
-I've fallen in love with this place.
-Yeah, it's a pretty incredible place.

02:26.521 --> 02:28.356
-You can stay in a farmhouse.
-Okay.

02:28.439 --> 02:30.900
You can stay the other side
of the Hudson River.

02:30.984 --> 02:33.153
-Yeah.
-But I want to be off the main drag

02:33.236 --> 02:35.738
And our property's
right off this main street.

02:35.822 --> 02:38.575
-Here. Photos of the place we're going to.
-The carriage house.

02:38.658 --> 02:39.534
The carriage house.

02:39.617 --> 02:42.328
So, the carriage house
is 2,400 square feet,

02:42.412 --> 02:44.789
and it has two possible rental units.

02:44.873 --> 02:46.958
The first floor, I think,
could be one unit.

02:47.041 --> 02:49.586
And the second unit
would be the upper two levels.

02:50.378 --> 02:53.214
Those are pictures.
You're not showing me his website.

02:53.298 --> 02:55.258
It doesn't have a website.
He's new to it.

02:55.341 --> 02:59.095
And he's reached out to us to get help
launching this as a vacation rental.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.890
So I know that he's dropped
a bunch of cash into it.

03:01.973 --> 03:04.309
-Okay.
-He's kind of new to this industry.

03:04.392 --> 03:06.436
I think he's bitten off
more than he can chew.

03:06.519 --> 03:09.314
I know, but I'm excited to get into it
because I think he's doing

03:09.397 --> 03:11.649
what all city people
would love to be doing,

03:11.733 --> 03:14.986
helping pay for an investment property
with a short-term rental.

03:15.069 --> 03:17.238
-Let's go and take a look.
-You want me to grab your tea?

03:17.322 --> 03:20.158
-Do you mind?
-No. I could tell you had a lot going on.

03:24.412 --> 03:28.875
So, this is 7th, which means our house
should be right down here.

03:28.958 --> 03:32.420
Well, this is a killer location,
we're just steps off the drag.

03:32.503 --> 03:33.504
and that's us.

03:33.588 --> 03:36.424
The one in the middle. It's so close.

03:39.636 --> 03:41.179
I mean, this is a cutie.

03:41.262 --> 03:42.972
-Isn't it.
-Carriage house?

03:43.056 --> 03:45.308
-Gorgeous.
-I love carriage houses.

03:45.391 --> 03:48.978
I've never done one before.
That rosette at the top, the pop-out,

03:49.062 --> 03:51.606
the two big carriage doors.

03:52.774 --> 03:54.317
-Hey!
-Hi!

03:54.400 --> 03:56.527
-Hi, nice to meet you--
-Alex, nice to meet you.

03:56.611 --> 03:58.529
-Pleasure.
-How you doing?

03:58.613 --> 04:01.032
Look at your lady.
I'm calling this a dark dijon.

04:01.115 --> 04:02.951
-Yeah?
-What color would you call this?

04:03.034 --> 04:05.411
It's mustard for sure.
I don't know what flavor,

04:05.495 --> 04:09.040
but I'd started thinking about it
as a spoiled mustard because of the--

04:09.123 --> 04:12.168
-All this money you put into it?
-Yeah, it's been a little painful.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.712
-Are you over her?
-No, I'm not.

04:14.796 --> 04:16.714
I'm still in love with her,
but I need some help.

04:16.798 --> 04:20.343
My name's Alex, I'm 30 years old.
I live and work in New York City

04:20.426 --> 04:25.014
I initially purchased this house
in 2016 for $355,000.

04:25.098 --> 04:29.560
I spent $100,000 to renovate it.
Way more money than I expected.

04:29.644 --> 04:33.690
But it's just been costing me money
every single month that it sits here.

04:33.773 --> 04:36.484
It's just a money-losing investment.

04:36.567 --> 04:38.528
Right now, this place is a money pit.

04:38.611 --> 04:43.700
You have this look of,
"What the heck have IÂ got myself into?"

04:43.783 --> 04:45.702
-You're right.
-So, tell us about that that.

04:45.785 --> 04:48.621
No, you're right. That's a good read.

04:48.705 --> 04:52.125
I've owned it for two years.
And it's been vacant for two years.

04:52.208 --> 04:56.004
I spent a lot of time, money and energy
on it and it's not it's not rentable.

04:56.087 --> 04:58.881
And it's it's just been
kind of a cash drain.

04:58.965 --> 05:01.759
And coming from New York.
I don't seem to have the time.

05:01.843 --> 05:03.052
And you're not here full time.

05:03.136 --> 05:06.389
No. You know, I had some grand ideas
for a retail space downstairs

05:06.472 --> 05:07.515
and a residential upstairs.

05:07.598 --> 05:09.559
Of course, things change
when you run into issues.

05:09.642 --> 05:12.770
-What year is it exactly?
-I think 1789 is the foundation.

05:12.854 --> 05:15.565
-Wow.
-That's when Hudson was poppin'.

05:15.648 --> 05:19.068
It needs some help
and it needs to be rented.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.653
I have limited experience being a host.

05:20.737 --> 05:23.281
It's a ton of work and I don't know
if I can manage that

05:23.364 --> 05:27.660
because being in New York City
and having this house two hours away,

05:27.744 --> 05:29.746
I can't be managing
any kind of short-term rental.

05:29.829 --> 05:31.956
I really need Peter and Gen
to help me out

05:32.040 --> 05:34.500
and hopefully turn this place around
for me.

05:36.419 --> 05:38.463
-So this is it.
-Okay.

05:39.088 --> 05:42.884
It's definitely smaller
than I saw in the pictures,

05:42.967 --> 05:46.679
and there's nothing to work with.
No floors, no cabinets, nothing.

05:46.763 --> 05:52.018
You can see that it would lend well
to something of a storefront,

05:52.101 --> 05:53.853
maybe an art gallery
or something like that .

05:53.936 --> 05:55.271
Or a great vacation rental.

05:55.355 --> 05:58.024
Look, I know you were thinking
about this as retail,

05:58.107 --> 06:01.027
but as a businessman,
I see this as a potential place

06:01.110 --> 06:03.613
to have another sleeping area

06:03.696 --> 06:07.116
that could be rented separately
to the upstairs or in conjunction with.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.327
Like me, I have a family with three kids.

06:09.410 --> 06:10.912
I'd like to rent the whole space.

06:10.995 --> 06:13.331
Peter says let's make this
a short-term rental.

06:13.414 --> 06:16.793
And I don't see that right now
because it's such a small space.

06:16.876 --> 06:20.588
My vision was a retail space.
So, we'll see.

06:21.089 --> 06:25.676
I mean, this is great. Imagine if you were
a guest here and this becomes that.

06:25.760 --> 06:30.515
There's a dining room table all along
this long narrow corridor, right?

06:30.598 --> 06:33.393
You open up your windows,
you're eating with your family.

06:33.476 --> 06:37.772
People are walking by,
maybe have a few rocking chairs, whatever.

06:37.855 --> 06:40.191
I love this indoor-outdoor thing.

06:40.274 --> 06:43.736
This is a big marketing point,
a big selling point for this place.

06:43.820 --> 06:46.239
-Right. I love that.
-You've got a diamond here, mate.

06:46.322 --> 06:48.116
-Thank you so much.
-Yeah.

06:48.199 --> 06:50.576
-Let's go look at the upstairs unit.
-All right.

06:50.660 --> 06:52.412
-Let's do it.
-We're ready to do it.

06:54.747 --> 06:59.210
-This is really sweet.
-This is lovely.

06:59.752 --> 07:01.963
-Did you do all this?
-Yes.

07:02.046 --> 07:04.632
The majority of the money went
toward renovating this kitchen.

07:04.715 --> 07:07.468
Ample size kitchen.
It's a good open layout.

07:07.552 --> 07:11.931
Open to the rest of the room. You're not
holed-up in an old 1700s kitchen.

07:12.014 --> 07:15.893
So, there's two floors in this upper unit.
This floor and another upstairs, right?

07:15.977 --> 07:18.521
-Right. Yes, there's a third floor.
-Let's go.

07:18.604 --> 07:20.273
-Watch your head.
-Cute!

07:20.356 --> 07:22.775
-Okay.
-Don't be afraid to use the handrail here.

07:23.693 --> 07:27.363
So this is the first landing and what
could be a small guest room.

07:27.447 --> 07:30.867
-Okay.
-This space is amazing.

07:30.950 --> 07:34.579
It's a total blank canvas,
which is a designer's dream.

07:34.662 --> 07:37.206
I'm gonna turn this out.
This is so sweet.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.709
-It's a nice space--
-And the ceilings are so high,

07:39.792 --> 07:42.795
but this rosette is beckoning,
it's still--

07:44.422 --> 07:45.673
-Sure.
-That's lovely.

07:45.756 --> 07:48.759
If you wanna poke your head out
and shout to your friend from the street.

07:48.843 --> 07:53.306
This is where, I guess, the hay was
downstairs from the carriage house, right?

07:53.389 --> 07:58.060
I suppose. I wasn't around then,
so I don't know what was happening.

07:58.144 --> 08:01.772
-I love this! This was money too.
-Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

08:01.856 --> 08:04.358
So, the third floor,
I've put some money into that as well.

08:04.442 --> 08:06.694
I had to meet code
with the sprinkler system.

08:06.777 --> 08:09.238
I put skylights in there
in an egressible window.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.866
And it shows a lot of light,
it's really beautiful.

08:11.949 --> 08:16.662
I know that all of this stuff
that's hidden away costs a packet.

08:16.746 --> 08:19.207
But you have not wasted money doing this.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.542
No, you're right.
And I need to recognize that.

08:21.626 --> 08:25.046
And you guys are inspiring me,
so this is something that,

08:25.129 --> 08:28.299
even though I spent
so much money on it, I think--

08:28.382 --> 08:31.552
-You want to make it work.
-Yeah. And I need some help. Clearly.

08:31.636 --> 08:33.011
Let's get down to business.

08:35.932 --> 08:38.100
-Okay.
-Talk to me.

08:38.183 --> 08:40.727
How much were you hoping to make?
What are your goals?

08:40.811 --> 08:46.442
Well, ultimately, I'd like to recoup
all of the renovation expense.

08:46.526 --> 08:50.571
I was originally thinking that I would
rent it as retail downstairs,

08:50.655 --> 08:52.198
-residential upstairs.
-Yeah.

08:52.281 --> 08:57.036
I figured that I could get
$1,500 downstairs, and potentially,

08:57.119 --> 08:59.622
$2,000, that might be aggressive,
for the upstairs.

08:59.705 --> 09:01.165
So, $3,500 a month.

09:01.249 --> 09:05.545
This place is costing me money every
single month that it sits here.

09:05.628 --> 09:08.839
I need to figure out how I can make
as much money as I possibly can.

09:08.923 --> 09:12.718
When it comes to short-term rentals,
think of it like three legs on a stool.

09:12.802 --> 09:14.053
You've gotÂ marketing,

09:14.554 --> 09:17.682
you've got operations
and you've got experiences, right?

09:17.765 --> 09:18.933
It's like owning a hotel.

09:19.016 --> 09:22.103
You need to get into the mindset of--
You're a general manager

09:22.186 --> 09:24.605
-of your own small boutique hotel.
-Yeah.

09:24.689 --> 09:28.401
So, I still think you can make more money
if you change the retail space

09:28.484 --> 09:30.403
into a short-term rental space.

09:30.486 --> 09:32.738
Your competition,
your "comps" as we call it,

09:32.822 --> 09:37.493
within five miles of you,
there are 199 properties.

09:37.577 --> 09:40.871
And the average nightly rate
is about 200 bucks.

09:40.955 --> 09:43.457
The difference with your places,

09:43.541 --> 09:46.419
if you rent out the upper unit,
I think, with certainty,

09:46.502 --> 09:49.463
-you could get $250 a night, okay?
-Okay.

09:49.547 --> 09:52.675
And then if you change the retail space
into a vacation rental,

09:52.758 --> 09:55.886
I think you'll get
about $150 a night for it.

09:56.429 --> 09:59.098
So that's $400 a night.

09:59.181 --> 10:02.101
The average occupancy rate
in Hudson is 48%

10:02.184 --> 10:04.729
That's about 15 nights per month.

10:04.812 --> 10:10.818
So, $400 times 15 is $6,000
or $72,000 a year.

10:10.901 --> 10:14.530
If I can get $6,000 a month,
that's way more than I expected to make,

10:14.614 --> 10:16.741
and it would help me
chip away at a lot of the costs

10:16.824 --> 10:18.576
I put into it over the past two years.

10:18.993 --> 10:22.038
If this was my property,
I would be so confident in it.

10:22.622 --> 10:25.833
So, will you let us change your
retail space into a short-term rental?

10:30.087 --> 10:32.798
-Go for it, yeah.
-All right, good. I feel better.

10:43.351 --> 10:46.854
We're launching our business plan,
and since this is Alex's first time,

10:46.937 --> 10:51.484
we have to teach him the basics,
or the 101 of short-term rental.

10:51.567 --> 10:54.528
we need to execute
a unique design that will help

10:54.612 --> 10:56.947
distinguish his property from all
the other rentals,

10:57.031 --> 10:59.700
and pull it off at a price
that Alex can afford.

11:00.076 --> 11:04.038
Next, we'll show Alex how to create
a website to promote his new listing.

11:04.622 --> 11:07.583
We'll also help find someone
to host his property.

11:07.667 --> 11:11.504
And finally, we'll show Alex how to offer
one of the most important elements

11:11.587 --> 11:14.173
experiences.

11:16.384 --> 11:18.010
-Alexander.
-Yeah?

11:21.722 --> 11:23.391
Let's talk about what's going where,

11:23.474 --> 11:25.976
'cause we need to start construction
on everything.

11:27.853 --> 11:31.565
To convert this into
a short-term, we've got to make this feel

11:31.649 --> 11:33.693
like a hotel room with soul.

11:33.776 --> 11:38.989
This whole back area, I want to extend
the bathroom so we have a full bathroom,

11:39.073 --> 11:41.409
yeah, with shower into kitchenette.

11:41.492 --> 11:44.161
Then we have this back wall
which was retail.

11:44.245 --> 11:47.832
I need this to be the destination
that seduces you in from the street.

11:47.915 --> 11:49.709
This is where we know
it's a carriage house.

11:49.792 --> 11:51.043
Where does the bed go?

11:51.127 --> 11:53.754
-This is my bedroom, living room area.
-Okay.

11:53.838 --> 11:57.550
Very much a studio apartment,
where kitchen and sleeping and lounging

11:57.633 --> 11:58.884
are all in one space.

11:58.968 --> 12:02.847
I'm trying to imagine how you'll fit,
but you're the expert.

12:02.930 --> 12:06.267
The furniture budget is another budget
that we really haven't talked about.

12:06.350 --> 12:09.478
And we have a lot of house to furnish,
so I know you're already

12:09.562 --> 12:11.397
super overly invested in this house.

12:11.480 --> 12:14.442
So I'd like to keep that budget
as small as possible.

12:14.525 --> 12:15.901
So let's look at we already have

12:15.985 --> 12:18.821
so I know what I have to play with
and don't have to buy.

12:18.904 --> 12:20.197
-Okay, great.
-Yeah?

12:20.281 --> 12:21.407
Yeah, let's go.

12:25.536 --> 12:28.164
All right, let's see
what you've got, Alex.

12:28.247 --> 12:33.961
That's all yours?
What's that lantern? I like that.

12:34.044 --> 12:36.547
-This is a yes?
-No.

12:36.630 --> 12:41.302
Yes. No. I want the basket, yes.
I want whatever that is, yes.

12:41.385 --> 12:43.512
We need big stuff. No.

12:45.055 --> 12:46.932
-No.
-What about these pieces?

12:47.016 --> 12:48.267
-No.
-Design pieces, no?

12:48.350 --> 12:50.227
I hate those bulbs though.
Get rid of those.

12:50.311 --> 12:52.688
- Hey, no for that.
- I mean I don't know.

12:52.772 --> 12:55.816
No, this is a three-storey house
that we have to fill.

12:55.900 --> 12:58.611
I don't think we have enough stuff
to fill your house.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.030
We need a lot more furniture.

13:01.113 --> 13:02.323
Okay...

13:02.406 --> 13:06.702
We don't have that kind of money to spend
but I think I've got an idea.

13:06.786 --> 13:12.541
You happen to be located in the king town
of antiques and furniture and art.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.377
If you think of your B&amp;B

13:15.461 --> 13:19.715
much like an antique store
or on-consignment store,

13:19.799 --> 13:25.846
you could potentially move a lot
of furniture from shops into your house

13:25.930 --> 13:30.768
and make a profit, or just help you
be able to use their furniture.

13:30.851 --> 13:33.312
Yeah. How would that work exactly?

13:33.395 --> 13:35.940
Hotels have been doing this for decades.

13:36.023 --> 13:37.983
You want to buy the sheets
you're sleeping on,

13:38.067 --> 13:42.112
the hotel store carries all the amenities
that you find in your room.

13:42.196 --> 13:45.032
It's kind of a boutique experience
and it's free for you,

13:45.115 --> 13:46.450
and we don't have a lot
of choice.

13:46.534 --> 13:50.496
Because Hudson is Hudson,
people come here to go antiquing,

13:50.579 --> 13:53.999
so that they can sleep in a place
that's full of antiques,

13:54.083 --> 13:56.794
so sleeping and antiquing
at the same time.

13:56.877 --> 13:58.754
I see a marketing ploy.

13:58.838 --> 14:02.842
I can't help it. I think like a marketer.
I always need a hook and I think it came.

14:02.925 --> 14:06.470
I have my concerns. There are certainly
issues that need to be worked out,

14:06.554 --> 14:09.598
but I'm gonna go along with it
and figure out what Gen has in mind.

14:09.682 --> 14:10.558
Let's go.

14:12.518 --> 14:14.812
I have to say, I love coming to Hudson.

14:15.646 --> 14:20.067
This consignment idea delivers
a wonderful hook for Alex's new rental.

14:20.150 --> 14:24.113
The guests can shop right where they're
staying, and Alex can save money

14:24.196 --> 14:25.656
on furnishing his place.

14:25.739 --> 14:28.534
We just have to get
a local business onboard.

14:28.617 --> 14:32.746
The amount of furniture stores in
a 6,000-person town is pretty remarkable.

14:32.830 --> 14:35.499
I know. It might be some record
per capita, actually.

14:35.583 --> 14:38.502
-I think you might be right.
-Peter, you might have to check the stat.

14:38.586 --> 14:39.587
I will gladly do so.

14:39.670 --> 14:43.257
This is my friend Elizabeth and Andy's
place, it's an old ship captain's house.

14:43.340 --> 14:47.177
It's so pretty.
All the whaling industry ran this town.

14:47.261 --> 14:48.262
Yeah.

14:48.345 --> 14:51.348
-Wow.
-Okay. Let's look around, guys.

14:51.432 --> 14:53.267
-This looks amazing.
-We need chairs.

14:55.019 --> 14:56.645
Big art.

14:57.229 --> 14:59.064
This would be stunning.
I love this little owl.

14:59.148 --> 15:01.483
Here it is. This is the gilded owl.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.235
Luckily, Hudson is a small town.

15:03.319 --> 15:07.656
And Alex was able to introduce us to his
friends who had this incredible shop.

15:07.740 --> 15:10.826
We have an idea that we'd like
to bounce off you if you're open to that.

15:11.702 --> 15:14.705
So let me tell you a little bit
about a business opportunity,

15:14.788 --> 15:19.168
which we believe is a win-win,
is to curate some items,

15:19.251 --> 15:23.422
furniture, artwork,
to place into Alex's short-term rental

15:23.505 --> 15:27.384
that can be sold directly
almost like a consignment.

15:28.719 --> 15:32.723
This is really aimed at more of the city
folk who are coming here for the weekend

15:32.806 --> 15:37.353
who have disposable income
that may want to purchase items.

15:37.436 --> 15:40.147
So this is a way to kind of
up the exposure for you.

15:40.230 --> 15:44.026
It helps Alex, it helps you,
it helps Hudson.

15:44.109 --> 15:46.111
I don't think we could
furnish the whole place.

15:46.195 --> 15:48.530
No, you wouldn't be furnishing
the whole place.

15:48.614 --> 15:51.283
It would be a curated collection
from the Gilded Owl.

15:51.367 --> 15:54.912
I don't know how Elizabeth and Andy
are gonna feel, but I hope this works out.

15:54.995 --> 15:59.208
If, in fact, you're filtering people here
to the gallery and we're actually

15:59.291 --> 16:02.294
doing the sales and we're actually
presenting the material...

16:03.462 --> 16:04.380
-I think so.
-Yes.

16:04.463 --> 16:07.758
-Yeah, I like this.
-We like the collaborative process.

16:07.841 --> 16:09.468
-I think it works with us.
-Good.

16:09.551 --> 16:11.887
I think we'll call this
the community economy.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.263
-That's nice.
-You like it?

16:13.347 --> 16:14.807
Yeah, we like that.

16:14.890 --> 16:17.267
It sounds like we potentially have a deal.

16:17.351 --> 16:19.019
The idea is off and running.

16:19.103 --> 16:22.272
And we're gonna furnish
with items from the Gilded Owl.

16:22.898 --> 16:26.652
And they introduced to their friends
who provided even more decor.

16:26.735 --> 16:28.696
Oh, my God, I love your store.

16:28.779 --> 16:33.575
This could actually be a really nice
shelving unit in the carriage house.

16:35.244 --> 16:37.162
I want to look for a headboard.

16:37.246 --> 16:38.872
This is pretty beautiful.

16:39.540 --> 16:43.419
These would make an excellent headboard
for the master.

16:44.878 --> 16:47.840
All right, so we got our eyes
on some really special things.

16:54.638 --> 16:57.641
It's time for me to have
some fun. So here's the design plan.

16:57.725 --> 17:00.811
I want to give the downstairs unit
a cozy carriage house feel

17:00.894 --> 17:04.647
by wrapping the room in wainscotting,
building a table from salvage,

17:04.732 --> 17:06.817
and using a very classic color palette.

17:06.900 --> 17:10.570
Then the upper unit will have a clean
art gallery feel where guests can stay

17:10.654 --> 17:13.490
in a very upstate style with curated
furniture and art

17:13.574 --> 17:15.117
that they can actually buy.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.243
Finally, to increase the sleep capacity,

17:17.327 --> 17:20.039
I'll separate the space upstairs
with French doors

17:20.122 --> 17:23.541
to create two sleeping areas,
much like you'd see in a hotel suite.

17:27.171 --> 17:29.965
-Yeah, dudes. Yes.
-Ta-da.

17:30.424 --> 17:35.220
-Yes! You like those doors?
-I absolutely adore the doors.

17:35.304 --> 17:36.889
This is gonna be our headboard.

17:36.972 --> 17:40.225
I like to save the hosts money by creating
spaces within spaces.

17:40.309 --> 17:43.103
-Okay.
-So what we do on the back side is,

17:43.187 --> 17:46.190
without having to build a closet now,

17:46.273 --> 17:49.359
I can hang a rod across,
and I have dresser storage.

17:49.443 --> 17:52.112
We've almost created
a dressing room within a room,

17:52.196 --> 17:54.907
which I think is nice
and gives it privacy.

17:54.990 --> 17:55.908
Love it.

18:02.831 --> 18:05.542
We have our marketing hook
with the consignment concept.

18:05.626 --> 18:08.629
Now, we need to focus
on stage two ofÂ  marketing,

18:08.712 --> 18:13.008
what every short-term rental owner
needs to book their property: a website.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.677
Jess works for Lodgify.

18:15.761 --> 18:20.682
In conjunction with having your property
on Airbnb, VRBO, HomeAway,

18:20.766 --> 18:25.062
it's crucial as a business strategy
to create your own website

18:25.145 --> 18:26.522
that you are in control of.

18:26.605 --> 18:28.357
So, the bigger platforms
charge a commission,

18:28.440 --> 18:30.901
either to the owner or the traveler
or to both.

18:30.984 --> 18:34.113
When you have your own website
that the guest can directly

18:34.196 --> 18:37.491
make that reservation on your website
and pay by credit card,

18:38.075 --> 18:39.910
that means there's no fee involved.

18:39.993 --> 18:42.162
We basically provide owners with one place

18:42.246 --> 18:44.206
to manage everything
for their vacation rental.

18:44.289 --> 18:47.209
So, that's all your calendars,
your reservations,

18:47.292 --> 18:50.212
so you're not managing
a million different apps.

18:50.295 --> 18:53.632
And you can see everything
in one calendar view very simply.

18:53.715 --> 18:57.386
What are the top things you recommend
he pays really close attention to?

18:57.469 --> 18:59.888
When creating a website,
in the top three things,

18:59.972 --> 19:02.307
we have to have great
professional photography.

19:02.391 --> 19:05.811
The second thing is a really good
description, good copy.

19:05.894 --> 19:07.354
The third thing is reviews.

19:07.437 --> 19:10.315
You need to build up a good rapport
with your guests

19:10.399 --> 19:13.527
So they leave you a great review
and this acts as a testimonial

19:13.610 --> 19:15.571
-for future guests, you know?
-Okay.

19:15.988 --> 19:19.658
I love the idea of building a brand
with this unique carriage house.

19:19.741 --> 19:22.578
It's a super exciting time to be part
of the vacation rental industry

19:22.661 --> 19:25.789
because it's predicted to be worth
about 198 billion by 2020.

19:25.873 --> 19:28.792
-God.
-So we're excited to be a part of it.

19:28.876 --> 19:32.838
So one of the most important facts
about Alex's property is its location.

19:32.921 --> 19:35.549
How can we demonstrate that
to the potential guests?

19:35.632 --> 19:37.885
Some drone photography or videography.

19:38.260 --> 19:39.469
-Drones!
-We like drones.

19:39.553 --> 19:42.181
-I love drones.
-Drone photography can help with that.

19:42.264 --> 19:44.391
I think it's time to go fly some drones.

19:44.474 --> 19:46.143
-Thank you guys.
-You've been amazing.

19:50.647 --> 19:53.192
One, two...

19:55.444 --> 19:56.528
Nice!

19:59.239 --> 20:03.535
In my companies in L.A., we were one of
the first to adopt drone footage.

20:03.619 --> 20:06.330
The reason why drones are so important
is because

20:06.413 --> 20:09.124
when people are thumbing through listings,

20:09.208 --> 20:13.128
if you have aerial photography, they're
gonna see that your location is banging

20:13.212 --> 20:14.880
'cause we're in the beating heart
of Hudson.

20:14.963 --> 20:17.341
Can you get this all on the front page
of my website?

20:17.424 --> 20:19.426
You can put whatever you want
on your homepage.

20:19.509 --> 20:21.011
It's very cool. I love it.

20:21.094 --> 20:23.597
Great marketing helps you
beat out the competition.

20:23.680 --> 20:25.599
-Peter, can I give it a fly?
-Absolutely not.

20:25.682 --> 20:26.516
All right.

20:38.403 --> 20:40.739
We're pretty lucky
that we found these doors.

20:40.822 --> 20:45.118
That's the best thing about old towns,
is the architectural salvage.

20:45.202 --> 20:50.666
So these FrenchiesÂ  fit perfectly
in our little transitional archway.

20:50.749 --> 20:54.878
And what it does is it makes
two bedrooms out of one.

20:54.962 --> 20:58.840
Which means Alex can market his short-term
rental as having more bedrooms.

20:58.924 --> 21:02.761
So, we'll have the master and we'll have
some daybeds in here

21:02.844 --> 21:06.431
that act as a lounge or extra sleeping
for kids when they come to visit.

21:06.515 --> 21:10.018
This increases the value
of his short-term rental.

21:12.020 --> 21:15.857
The next step is to show Alex
how to create experiences for his guests.

21:15.941 --> 21:18.944
Because Hudson has
a blossoming food scene,

21:19.027 --> 21:21.655
we put together an organic
farm to table dining experience

21:21.738 --> 21:24.491
you could never find
at a New York City hotel.

21:24.574 --> 21:27.202
And that starts
with a tour of a local farm.

21:29.538 --> 21:31.957
No, seriously,
I've never been around cows.

21:32.040 --> 21:34.376
I'm a bit freaked out
to be honest with you.

21:34.459 --> 21:35.836
Are they gonna come for us?

21:35.919 --> 21:38.755
You have to walk
on your tiptoes or they'll charge.

21:38.839 --> 21:40.340
Welcome to our farm tour.

21:41.174 --> 21:47.806
We own 450 acres.
We raise Black Angus beef, all grass-fed.

21:47.889 --> 21:49.558
All animal welfare-approved.

21:49.641 --> 21:53.353
It takes longer to do it this way,
but cattle are monovores.

21:53.437 --> 21:56.773
They're meant to eatÂ grass alone.
And that's what our cattle eat.

21:56.857 --> 22:00.319
When we don't mess with their chemistry,
it doesn't mess with our chemistry.

22:00.402 --> 22:01.903
It's what nature intended.

22:01.987 --> 22:06.742
I think, you know, for your place,
if you could arrange to have tours--

22:06.825 --> 22:10.037
Yeah, it's incredible.
The message is certainly organic.

22:10.120 --> 22:13.290
I'd be grateful if we could bring
some guests from the carriage house here.

22:13.373 --> 22:15.208
-That'd be awesome.
-That'd be amazing.

22:15.292 --> 22:17.711
Then they can taste it
at your restaurant in town, Grazin'.

22:17.794 --> 22:20.339
This is true farm to table direct.

22:20.422 --> 22:23.842
When it comes to making a successful
short-term rental,

22:23.925 --> 22:27.763
there are so many things that go into it.
It's like being a hotel concierge.

22:27.846 --> 22:30.766
If guests could come in and experience
Hudson like a local,

22:30.849 --> 22:33.226
I think that's the best experience
they could have.

22:40.067 --> 22:42.611
-So this was an old-fashioned diner.
-Yeah.

22:42.694 --> 22:46.198
They took overÂ and now are doing the--
Not just organic,

22:46.281 --> 22:49.534
-it's pasture-raised, humane--
-Exactly.

22:49.618 --> 22:52.662
Everything from the farm we saw
is being served here.

22:52.746 --> 22:57.084
This is the quintessential
kind of American experience.

22:57.167 --> 22:59.169
Since Alex lives in New York full time,

22:59.252 --> 23:01.797
he needs a host to help run
his short-term rental.

23:01.880 --> 23:05.717
So we're introducing himÂ to a short-term
rental expert local to Hudson

23:05.801 --> 23:07.177
who might be able to help.

23:07.260 --> 23:09.012
When you were speaking yesterday,

23:09.096 --> 23:12.432
you mentioned that you could potentially
need someone to help you

23:12.516 --> 23:15.268
with the greeting in the management
and the X and the Y.

23:15.352 --> 23:19.940
It's exactly what I need, I would need
someone who can cater to the guests

23:20.023 --> 23:24.152
and tell me how that works
and hopefully do it for me.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.988
The host is an incredibly important thing.

23:27.072 --> 23:29.074
So I wanted to put you two together.

23:29.157 --> 23:30.992
You're experienced.

23:31.076 --> 23:34.079
Tell me what to expect
and how exactly it's worked for you.

23:34.162 --> 23:36.873
What we're really talking about is
inviting someone into your home

23:36.957 --> 23:40.585
even though you're not here, which
becomes their home when they have it.

23:40.669 --> 23:44.840
And a corporate world can never duplicate
that, no matter how sweet they talk.

23:44.923 --> 23:49.261
-Yeah.
-I think a lot of the issues go away

23:49.344 --> 23:51.721
when there's a sense
that there is a connection,

23:51.805 --> 23:53.723
when there's
a person-to-person connection.

23:53.807 --> 23:59.062
If the guest comes and they like the host,
or they like the entrÃ©e or feel cared for,

23:59.146 --> 24:02.607
even if something goes wrong,
it still works out.

24:03.150 --> 24:05.193
On weekends when the town is busy,

24:05.277 --> 24:07.988
and that's for stretching
into longer and longer periods,

24:08.071 --> 24:10.574
-there's 30, 40 phone calls per night.
-Really?

24:10.657 --> 24:14.244
Dave is not only a super kind,
wonderful person,

24:14.327 --> 24:17.831
but I think that maybe if we can
work something out,

24:17.914 --> 24:19.875
he could potentially host my place.

24:19.958 --> 24:23.879
-If David is willing and able--
-I'm interested. We'll talk about it.

24:23.962 --> 24:26.798
-So until tomorrow.
-We gotta skedaddle.

24:26.882 --> 24:29.759
-Nice to meet you.
-Yeah, really great to meet you, David.

24:38.018 --> 24:39.019
Here we go.

24:42.272 --> 24:45.108
Put the bowl of lemons over there.
Today is the big day.

24:45.192 --> 24:47.319
We're putting finishing touches
on the carriage house

24:47.402 --> 24:50.405
and we've got to move in
all the consignment furniture,

24:50.489 --> 24:53.658
hang all the local artwork, and pay
attention to all those little details

24:53.742 --> 24:55.410
that make the house feel special.

25:01.500 --> 25:04.169
Photography is
the most important factor

25:04.252 --> 25:05.962
when marketing a short-term rental.

25:06.046 --> 25:08.423
Get into that bookcase as well.

25:11.092 --> 25:15.055
All right, there's a point-of-sale device
in the corner I want to make sure we get.

25:15.138 --> 25:17.766
And that owl photograph
with the table underneath...

25:17.849 --> 25:20.352
-Got it.
-This is for sure our hero shot, Chris.

25:20.435 --> 25:22.729
-I want to stay here.
-Yeah, it's fantastic.

25:24.898 --> 25:27.609
This is my favorite part.
It's time to bring Alex home

25:27.692 --> 25:29.486
and show him his carriage house.

25:35.492 --> 25:36.993
Come here!

25:37.911 --> 25:39.996
-How are you guys?
-How are you?

25:40.080 --> 25:41.665
-Good to see you.
-Welcome back.

25:41.748 --> 25:44.751
-I'm psyched, can't wait to get in there.
-Let's take a look.

25:44.834 --> 25:49.381
-Come on. It's a little different.
-Oh, my God.

25:57.556 --> 26:00.767
This is amazing. How did you do this?

26:00.850 --> 26:04.646
This is really incredible, Gen. Wow.

26:04.729 --> 26:08.024
I don't even remember
what this looked like beforehand.

26:08.108 --> 26:09.234
This is really incredible.

26:09.317 --> 26:11.695
My first impression is, it's transformed.

26:11.778 --> 26:13.572
It's something entirely different.

26:13.655 --> 26:17.867
Downstairs space really does feel
like a carriage house. It's cool.

26:18.577 --> 26:21.496
This was your retail space,
your retail garage.

26:21.580 --> 26:24.291
-Yeah, it was.
-To see it like this,

26:24.374 --> 26:28.962
the business guy in me goes, "Okay,
now this is a business that can be rented.

26:29.045 --> 26:33.049
Couples, location, I mean,
it's really exciting.

26:33.133 --> 26:36.177
-You've got a greatÂ short-term rental now.
-It's great.

26:36.261 --> 26:37.596
You now have a little kitchenette.

26:39.889 --> 26:43.018
-Wasn't here before at all.
-I need to just soak it in.

26:43.101 --> 26:47.355
-This is like a full-service apartment.
-Yeah, this is great.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.065
I love the little kitchenette.

26:49.149 --> 26:51.276
I was questioning
how that was gonna work.

26:51.359 --> 26:55.322
I didn't know where they wouldÂ fit it in,
whether it was necessary.

26:55.405 --> 27:01.578
She transformed it from this dark, cold
space into something that is really cool.

27:01.661 --> 27:02.746
I think it's amazing.

27:02.829 --> 27:06.374
Are you ready to go upstairs
to see the next two floors?

27:06.458 --> 27:09.377
-I'm ready. Yeah, let's do it.
-You lead the way, at your pace.

27:09.461 --> 27:10.629
Great.

27:13.757 --> 27:15.634
Oh, my God. Guys, this is incredible.

27:20.513 --> 27:21.806
It's amazing.

27:23.099 --> 27:24.476
This is really great.

27:25.435 --> 27:28.897
Walking up to the second floor,
I think Gen did an amazing job.

27:28.980 --> 27:31.816
I was impressed with how
she brought in a lot of different art,

27:31.900 --> 27:33.777
a lot of different furniture
all into one space,

27:33.860 --> 27:35.862
and making it fit perfectly.

27:35.945 --> 27:38.281
Gen hit a home run here.
It's really incredible.

27:38.365 --> 27:39.658
Is this what you thought?

27:39.741 --> 27:42.535
I had no idea. It's amazing. It really is.

27:42.911 --> 27:45.664
Look at how much more
glamorous your house is.

27:45.997 --> 27:48.750
-I can't believe you did this in a week.
-Right?

27:48.833 --> 27:50.835
I can't believe you
brought all this stuff in here.

27:50.919 --> 27:53.421
This is Gilded Owl,
you have Gilded Owl chairs.

27:53.505 --> 27:55.340
You have Gilded Owl art.

27:55.423 --> 27:56.883
That looks fantastic.

27:56.966 --> 28:00.637
It looks amazing. It's great.
You guys did an awesome job.

28:03.014 --> 28:06.101
So this really is the essence of Hudson
in our eyes

28:06.184 --> 28:10.897
in that you can sleep next to the art
and furniture that Hudson is so known for

28:10.980 --> 28:14.192
in the architecture
that it's celebrated for.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.196
I'm super excited about this.

28:18.279 --> 28:21.574
You now have a store in your short-term
rental.

28:21.658 --> 28:24.744
All of the items that are here
on consignment, your guests can buy.

28:24.828 --> 28:27.372
Let's say you want to buy the owl.
I love the owl.

28:27.455 --> 28:30.917
You dial it up.
They swipe their credit card.

28:31.000 --> 28:35.255
The sale is made. The Gilded Owl
will send it and package it.

28:35.338 --> 28:36.881
And it will go directly.

28:36.965 --> 28:40.593
Every time there's a sale,
you make a little bit of juice on the top.

28:40.677 --> 28:42.762
-It's a great concept.
-Everybody wins.

28:42.846 --> 28:46.766
This is amazing. I'm so psyched
and impressed you guys figured it out.

28:46.850 --> 28:48.560
-Ready to go upstairs?
-I am.

28:48.643 --> 28:52.397
-You've got a lot more house to see.
-Let's go, I'm psyched, let's do it.

28:52.897 --> 28:55.650
-After you.
-This is my favorite part.

28:57.694 --> 28:59.320
Oh, my God,

29:00.321 --> 29:01.990
This looks sick.

29:02.073 --> 29:04.159
-This is really great.
-You like this?

29:04.242 --> 29:07.871
Yeah, Genevieve. You're right.
This is amazing. This is really cool.

29:08.496 --> 29:12.000
We added a lot of wallpaper
just to give some presence

29:12.083 --> 29:14.002
without adding a lot of furniture.

29:14.085 --> 29:17.797
This is for kids, or two extra people.

29:17.881 --> 29:20.300
-I can't believe you did this.
-Yeah, I did this!

29:20.383 --> 29:23.011
This is really-- Yeah, it's awesome.

29:23.094 --> 29:25.305
-And there's your master.
-Look at this.

29:28.391 --> 29:29.684
This is amazing.

29:30.143 --> 29:32.562
-This is so cool. I did not envision this.
-Good.

29:32.645 --> 29:36.316
I didn't think that you were gonna put
the bed this way, I was imagining

29:36.399 --> 29:40.653
it being over here. This is modern, sweet,
the candles, everything. This is great.

29:40.737 --> 29:44.783
And, Genevieve, this is fantastic.
you were able to put a closet in here.

29:44.866 --> 29:49.913
-I didn't know where that space would be--
-It's really an inexpensive way

29:49.996 --> 29:52.874
to build closet and build function.

29:53.374 --> 29:58.421
These tall salvaged doors that look like
they could have been here at one time

29:58.505 --> 30:00.548
act as a really epic headboard.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.884
It's really great.
I feel like I'm in a magazine.

30:02.967 --> 30:05.470
So, when Mom and Dad
and two kids are here,

30:06.179 --> 30:10.183
Mom and Dad can have a little privacy,
yet still keep their eye on the kids.

30:10.266 --> 30:14.062
And if you are with a different couple,
you can just put a blind on each one,

30:14.145 --> 30:17.398
pull it down, two separate bedrooms.
Options.

30:17.482 --> 30:18.650
It's great.

30:18.733 --> 30:21.945
What you don't do at home
that you do for short-term

30:22.028 --> 30:24.614
is you leave out a little bit of these
amenities.

30:24.697 --> 30:28.701
All of their towels you put out right away
so they don't go looking or wondering.

30:28.785 --> 30:31.287
There's shampoos, conditioners and soaps.

30:31.371 --> 30:35.875
So whoever ends up managing your property,
these are little things they need to do.

30:35.959 --> 30:40.839
While it might cost you $5,
means lots of money to them.

30:40.922 --> 30:43.341
-It means a return.
-You need to think about this

30:43.424 --> 30:46.803
like you are a general manager
of a small hotel.

30:46.886 --> 30:49.597
From a business standpoint,
I think I've learned a ton.

30:49.681 --> 30:53.601
I've been equipped with a ton of great
information. Peter's super informative.

30:53.685 --> 30:58.064
I really love with Gen did,
and it's an incredible space.

30:58.147 --> 31:00.275
She made it into something
that is super unique.

31:00.358 --> 31:06.489
You have a world-class business
with multiple revenue streams.

31:07.073 --> 31:10.577
Price it at 250 for these two floors,
150 for the carriage house.

31:10.660 --> 31:13.329
And that means if you rent it
for 15 nights a month,

31:13.413 --> 31:16.165
you can hit your goal of 6,000 a month.

31:16.249 --> 31:19.335
And I think--
I think you're going to be packed.

31:19.419 --> 31:21.921
That's a home run for me.
I mean, I love that.

31:22.005 --> 31:24.591
-I think it's that time.
-Wait, you're leaving?

31:24.674 --> 31:27.802
That's it, we're done.
Now, let's launch your new listing.

31:28.845 --> 31:32.557
Steeped in American history,
straight out of a Norman Rockwell,

31:32.640 --> 31:35.393
this 1784 carriage house stands proudly

31:35.476 --> 31:38.271
with its three levels
and room for eight comfortably.

31:38.354 --> 31:41.190
Located steps from the main thoroughfare
of Warren Street

31:41.274 --> 31:43.735
that has some of the best eateries,
art, and antique stores

31:43.818 --> 31:45.320
the northeast has to offer,

31:45.403 --> 31:47.697
the Carriage House in Hudson
gives an authentic glimpse

31:47.780 --> 31:49.908
of romantic years gone by.

31:49.991 --> 31:53.453
You can buy the furniture, sleep and shop

31:53.536 --> 31:57.165
while providing the ultimate contemporary
short-term rental experience.
