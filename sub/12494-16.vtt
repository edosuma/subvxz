WEBVTT

00:03.041 --> 00:06.750
PJ, this French toast is so good.

00:06.834 --> 00:08.917
It's fluffy on the inside,

00:09.000 --> 00:10.417
crunchy on the outside.

00:10.500 --> 00:12.250
Yeah, and when you push it with a fork

00:12.333 --> 00:13.834
it makes a squishy sound.

00:14.917 --> 00:16.834
Squishy, squishy, squishy.

00:19.417 --> 00:21.417
Oh. I can't be cool all the time.

00:23.500 --> 00:25.041
So, Bob, you all set for wednesday?

00:25.125 --> 00:27.917
Wednesday. Uh... Hump day,

00:28.000 --> 00:30.333
middle of the week day, your...

00:30.417 --> 00:32.208
Birthday?

00:33.917 --> 00:35.250
It's Halloween.

00:35.333 --> 00:36.917
Oh. Well, good.
I don't have to do anything.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.917
Yes, you do.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.917
It's the baby's first Halloween.
You have to dress up.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.083
Oh, there'll be other Halloweens.

00:43.166 --> 00:44.583
There'll be other babies.

00:47.959 --> 00:49.250
- PJ?
- Yup.

00:49.375 --> 00:51.917
Do you think you could
cook an actual French dinner?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.375
Well, I think so. Why?

00:53.458 --> 00:55.250
Well, because my one-year
anniversary with Spencer

00:55.333 --> 00:56.792
is coming up and I want to surprise him

00:56.875 --> 00:57.875
with a romantic dinner.

00:57.959 --> 00:58.875
And it has to be French

00:58.959 --> 01:00.875
because we met in French class.

01:00.959 --> 01:02.667
Oh, it was a rainy monday.

01:02.750 --> 01:05.291
Freshman year, third period.

01:05.375 --> 01:06.959
We were both in mademoiselle
Fisher's class--

01:07.041 --> 01:08.166
Teddy?

01:08.250 --> 01:10.375
You're painting a wonderful tapestry

01:10.458 --> 01:12.917
of words to conjure up a place in time...

01:13.834 --> 01:15.583
And that is why I’m leaving.

01:20.250 --> 01:21.625
Cool again.

01:22.959 --> 01:25.125
So, uh, what do you think?

01:25.208 --> 01:27.542
Sure, I’ll make you guys dinner.
Sounds fun.

01:27.625 --> 01:29.500
Can we do it at your place
on Halloween night?

01:29.583 --> 01:31.000
That way Spencer won't suspect a thing

01:31.083 --> 01:33.000
and I can make him dress up.

01:33.083 --> 01:36.208
See? Teddy's getting Spencer to dress up.

01:36.250 --> 01:38.417
You can't compare me to a 17-year-old.

01:38.500 --> 01:40.500
Well, that's for sure.

What's with the mask?

02:44.041 --> 02:46.333
Using that old chestnut again, huh?

02:46.417 --> 02:48.041
Hey, if it ain't broke.

02:48.917 --> 02:50.125
Now what do you want?

02:50.750 --> 02:52.709
I actually want to discuss Halloween.

02:52.792 --> 02:56.250
I was thinking this year
we might skip the annual pranks.

02:56.375 --> 02:58.792
I’m getting too old for pranks anyway.

02:58.875 --> 03:01.583
Although I did already
buy the eggs and shaving cream.

03:01.667 --> 03:03.792
I could take those off you.

03:03.875 --> 03:06.583
I can use the eggs for breakfast
and the shaving cream for...

03:06.667 --> 03:08.583
Ah, bup bup bup bup bup!

03:08.667 --> 03:10.709
...my legs.

03:10.792 --> 03:11.709
I’m sorry.

03:11.792 --> 03:14.000
Do you not know what
"bup bup bup bup" means?

03:14.583 --> 03:16.166
Listen, while I’m here,

03:16.250 --> 03:17.875
I need to ask you something else.

03:17.959 --> 03:20.500
Can you ride with me
to my ladies' club meeting

03:20.583 --> 03:22.875
Wednesday night so I can
use the carpool lane?

03:24.583 --> 03:26.000
I’ll pay you.

03:26.083 --> 03:27.000
How much?

03:27.083 --> 03:28.625
And do we have to talk to each other?

03:29.166 --> 03:31.083
Thirty bucks.

03:31.166 --> 03:32.333
And what do you think?

03:34.583 --> 03:35.917
See you Wednesday.

03:40.417 --> 03:41.625
Amy: Are you ready?

03:41.709 --> 03:43.500
I am ready.

03:50.959 --> 03:52.333
Good day, mate.

03:52.417 --> 03:54.625
My name's kangaramy

03:54.709 --> 03:56.417
and these are my little joeys,

03:56.500 --> 03:58.500
Charlie and Toby.

04:00.291 --> 04:03.041
A family of kangaroos. That's cute.

04:03.125 --> 04:04.667
Cute? It took us two hours

04:04.750 --> 04:07.125
to get into these costumes,
and all we get is "cute"?

04:08.709 --> 04:10.333
No worries, mate.

04:10.458 --> 04:12.375
Throw another shrimp on the barbie.

04:12.500 --> 04:13.875
Shut up, Bob.

04:15.959 --> 04:18.083
Go ahead, Charlie.
Tell him what we practiced.

04:18.166 --> 04:19.542
I wanna be a princess.

04:19.959 --> 04:22.083
Everybody wants to be a princess.

04:22.166 --> 04:23.667
That's why you're a kangaroo.

04:25.375 --> 04:27.250
What she was supposed to say was

04:27.375 --> 04:29.500
"Hoppy Halloween"!

04:29.583 --> 04:31.000
Where's your costume?

04:31.083 --> 04:32.583
Uh... I’m wearing it.

04:32.667 --> 04:33.875
Those are your work clothes.

04:33.959 --> 04:35.667
Yeah! No, I’m a--

04:35.750 --> 04:37.500
I’m going as an exterminator this year.

04:38.166 --> 04:39.375
An exterminator?

04:39.458 --> 04:41.792
Okay, I am sweating
my marsupial butt off in here

04:41.917 --> 04:43.875
and that's the best you came up with?

04:43.959 --> 04:45.583
All right. Well, hang on.

04:45.667 --> 04:47.166
I’m not done. I’m not done. You know what?

04:50.542 --> 04:52.083
Huh?

04:52.250 --> 04:53.166
There.

04:54.041 --> 04:56.041
I’m a superhero exterminator.

04:57.500 --> 04:59.917
I’m Captain Extermo.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.417
Who's your sidekick? Pesticide pete?

05:06.375 --> 05:08.917
Mommy, this candy's yucky.

05:09.250 --> 05:10.709
What?

05:13.917 --> 05:16.417
"Uncle milt's honey globs."

05:17.125 --> 05:19.000
Why did you buy this disgusting candy?

05:19.083 --> 05:20.417
It's not disgusting.

05:20.500 --> 05:21.875
It was on sale.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.709
"Ingredients, honey...

05:25.792 --> 05:27.000
Glob."

05:29.500 --> 05:31.208
Bob, go get some better candy.

05:31.291 --> 05:33.417
Uh, Bob's not here right now.

05:33.542 --> 05:35.709
I’m Captain Extermo.

05:36.792 --> 05:38.500
Okay. Well, when you see Bob,

05:38.583 --> 05:40.250
could you tell him I'd like
to speak with him?

05:40.333 --> 05:42.583
Uh, who would like to speak to him?

05:42.667 --> 05:44.750
Kangaramy or Amy?

05:45.959 --> 05:46.959
Amy.

05:47.041 --> 05:50.458
Ooh, he may be gone for a while.

05:59.834 --> 06:02.458
Happy anniversary!

06:02.542 --> 06:03.917
Surprise!

06:04.542 --> 06:06.208
I took you to Paris.

06:06.542 --> 06:07.542
Bonjour.

06:07.625 --> 06:10.250
Welcome to Chez pejhay.

06:11.250 --> 06:12.250
What?

06:12.750 --> 06:14.291
Chez pejhay.

06:16.333 --> 06:17.375
Chez PJ.

06:17.500 --> 06:19.250
Both: Oh!

06:19.333 --> 06:21.250
Stupid tourists.

06:23.500 --> 06:25.417
So, um, I decorated the place

06:25.500 --> 06:27.625
and PJ is going to cook us

06:27.709 --> 06:29.709
an authentic French meal.

06:29.792 --> 06:32.208
Although, we didn't discuss the accent.

06:32.250 --> 06:35.333
To cook French, you must be French.

06:35.417 --> 06:37.083
Your table.

06:38.083 --> 06:39.291
Tadah!

06:39.375 --> 06:41.000
Um, I think "tadah"

06:41.083 --> 06:42.458
is more magician than French.

06:43.583 --> 06:44.875
Your table.

06:44.959 --> 06:46.875
Voila!

06:47.875 --> 06:50.333
Your menus for the evening.

06:50.875 --> 06:52.000
There's only one thing on it.

06:52.083 --> 06:53.750
An excellent choice.

06:54.291 --> 06:56.834
And now, the music.

06:59.959 --> 07:01.083
Hey!

07:01.166 --> 07:02.667
Emmett's here.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.792
Another thing we didn't discuss.

07:06.375 --> 07:07.542
When you play the accordion,

07:07.625 --> 07:09.333
you never turn down a gig.

07:17.250 --> 07:18.959
Gabe: Huh.

07:19.041 --> 07:21.625
A room full of old ladies
on Halloween night.

07:24.375 --> 07:26.291
And suddenly I’m not cool again.

07:28.750 --> 07:30.250
So how long is this gonna take?

07:30.333 --> 07:32.208
Just until I get my award.

07:32.291 --> 07:33.917
You're getting an award?

07:34.000 --> 07:36.917
Yes, for being the volunteer of the year.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.959
It's for my work with troubled kids.

07:41.500 --> 07:43.000
But you hate kids.

07:43.083 --> 07:44.667
But I do like awards.

07:45.959 --> 07:48.875
And I may have mentioned
that I would bring

07:48.959 --> 07:51.166
one of the troubled kids with me tonight.

07:53.959 --> 07:55.583
Wait a minute.

07:56.083 --> 07:58.000
Something doesn't smell right here,

07:58.083 --> 08:00.083
and it's not just the old ladies.

08:02.166 --> 08:05.083
You brought me here
just so you could get a stupid award!

08:05.166 --> 08:08.083
Happy Halloween!

08:08.166 --> 08:10.166
you've been tricked and it's my treat.

08:15.875 --> 08:17.041
You take this one.

08:22.125 --> 08:23.458
Trick or treat!

08:25.583 --> 08:27.625
Hey! All right.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.041
There you go.

08:30.125 --> 08:32.917
Hey, that is one cool costume.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.375
I’m thinking wolf spider?

08:35.458 --> 08:37.250
Yeah. I’m really into bugs.

08:37.333 --> 08:38.917
Yeah? Me too.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.125
Check it out.

08:40.208 --> 08:42.917
I’m Captain Extermo.

08:43.500 --> 08:45.834
A superhero exterminator?

08:45.917 --> 08:47.417
Awesome!

08:48.792 --> 08:50.709
Can I get a picture with you?

08:52.125 --> 08:53.917
Yeah! Sure.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.166
Honey, you wanna come over here?

08:56.250 --> 08:58.917
Somebody wants a picture
with Captain Extermo.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.166
What?

09:01.458 --> 09:03.000
What are you supposed to be?

09:03.083 --> 09:05.333
A dog that ate another dog?

09:08.375 --> 09:10.083
I’m a kangaroo.

09:10.166 --> 09:11.959
And this is my joey.

09:12.041 --> 09:13.667
Just take the picture.

09:25.583 --> 09:28.458
May I present the first course?

09:28.542 --> 09:30.458
Sweetbreads.

09:30.542 --> 09:31.458
Tadah!

09:32.959 --> 09:34.959
I looked it up. "Tadah" is acceptable.

09:37.834 --> 09:39.750
Hmm. Bread and sweets,
two of my favorite things.

09:41.041 --> 09:43.041
Neither one of which is
in my mouth right now.

09:45.208 --> 09:46.458
-Garcon?
-Oui?

09:46.542 --> 09:49.000
What exactly are in these sweetbreads?

09:49.083 --> 09:51.333
You have pancreas

09:51.417 --> 09:54.125
and the gentleman has stomach lining.

09:54.208 --> 09:55.417
Bon appetit.

09:58.250 --> 10:00.000
Emmett.

10:02.083 --> 10:03.417
Do you want any sweetbreads?

10:03.500 --> 10:04.917
No, but I know who might.

10:14.500 --> 10:16.083
It's like they haven't
had pancreas in weeks.

10:20.166 --> 10:21.667
You know what, Teddy?

10:22.166 --> 10:23.583
This is really nice.

10:23.667 --> 10:26.166
Well, it was as close as I could get
to a trip to Paris.

10:26.208 --> 10:27.667
Plus, I thought it would be perfect

10:27.750 --> 10:29.500
considering where we first met.

10:29.583 --> 10:31.667
Oh, yeah. Of course.

10:31.750 --> 10:32.875
Yeah, I’ll never forget it.

10:32.959 --> 10:35.250
We were in French class
and I dropped my pen

10:35.333 --> 10:36.959
and then you said...

10:37.875 --> 10:40.500
"Hey, a pen."

10:42.542 --> 10:43.667
No, no.

10:43.750 --> 10:45.667
You picked it up, you handed it to me,

10:45.750 --> 10:46.959
and you said,

10:47.041 --> 10:49.542
"Votre plume,mademoiselle."

10:49.625 --> 10:51.250
Oh, yeah. Of course.

10:53.125 --> 10:54.917
You don't remember any of this, do you?

10:56.834 --> 10:58.667
Honestly, no.

10:59.125 --> 11:00.750
But does it really matter where we met?

11:00.834 --> 11:02.041
Does it matter?

11:02.125 --> 11:04.542
It's only the beginning
of our relationship.

11:04.917 --> 11:05.959
Spence, we talked about

11:06.041 --> 11:08.500
how we both wanted to go to Paris someday.

11:10.834 --> 11:12.583
I can't believe I went
through all this trouble

11:12.667 --> 11:14.083
and you don't even remember!

11:15.083 --> 11:16.000
Wait, where are you going?

11:16.166 --> 11:18.166
As far away from you as I can get!

11:23.375 --> 11:25.792
I understand there's a problem
with the sweetbreads.

11:35.083 --> 11:38.291
And now, for her tireless work
with troubled kids,

11:38.375 --> 11:40.500
it is my sincere pleasure to present our

11:40.583 --> 11:42.000
"volunteer of the year" award

11:42.083 --> 11:44.625
- to Estelle Dabney.
- Oh.

11:46.083 --> 11:47.291
Thank you.

11:47.375 --> 11:51.959
And along with a plaque,
comes a check for $500.

11:52.041 --> 11:53.375
Oh.

11:53.417 --> 11:55.417
I had almost forgot about that part.

11:57.709 --> 11:59.458
I assume you'll be putting that money

11:59.542 --> 12:01.125
towards your work with troubled children.

12:01.208 --> 12:02.834
What else would I do with it?

12:02.917 --> 12:05.625
Buy a gold lame tracksuit?

12:07.917 --> 12:11.542
It's not enough I got tricked,
I gotta see that?

12:11.625 --> 12:13.333
I was hoping we could
hear from the young man

12:13.417 --> 12:14.625
you brought with you tonight.

12:14.709 --> 12:16.625
Maybe he could say a few words?

12:16.709 --> 12:18.208
Oh.

12:18.291 --> 12:19.542
That's not a good idea.

12:19.625 --> 12:21.917
He's very troubled.

12:23.208 --> 12:26.792
Oh, I'd be happy to say a few words.

12:29.125 --> 12:31.000
The type of words I say will depend

12:31.083 --> 12:33.000
on my cut of the 500.

12:33.083 --> 12:34.917
That's blackmail.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.375
That's right.

12:40.375 --> 12:41.750
Thank you, old ladies.

12:44.458 --> 12:47.792
My name is Gabe and I’m here to tell you

12:47.875 --> 12:50.667
the real story about mrs. Dabney.

12:50.750 --> 12:52.166
Fifty-fifty.

12:52.250 --> 12:54.166
This woman

12:54.250 --> 12:56.959
is my angel.

13:07.333 --> 13:08.542
Teddy...

13:08.959 --> 13:10.875
I’m sorry I forgot how we met.

13:11.417 --> 13:14.166
It's about more than
forgetting a few details.

13:14.250 --> 13:18.000
Sometimes I just feel like...

13:18.417 --> 13:21.333
I’m more into this
relationship than you are.

13:22.792 --> 13:24.625
Remember that period
when we were broken up?

13:24.709 --> 13:25.917
Yeah.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.208
How long was that?

13:28.417 --> 13:30.417
I don't know. Like nine months?

13:30.500 --> 13:33.709
Eight months, 19 days and four hours.

13:34.583 --> 13:35.542
Wow.

13:36.125 --> 13:38.750
Teddy, you're the best
thing that's ever happened to me.

13:39.458 --> 13:41.000
I may not remember the moment we met,

13:41.083 --> 13:43.500
but can still make this
a moment to remember.

13:43.583 --> 13:44.917
How are we gonna do that?

13:45.000 --> 13:46.792
Well, I have an idea.

13:53.542 --> 13:55.291
Uh, do you guys mind?

13:55.375 --> 13:57.000
We're trying to have a moment here.

13:57.083 --> 14:00.875
Yeah, and your moment is ruining
my Halloween party.

14:00.959 --> 14:02.875
Okay.

14:02.959 --> 14:05.750
Why are you guys all
dressed up in clown suits?

14:05.834 --> 14:07.583
Because we're clowns.

14:08.750 --> 14:11.875
So technically,
you're not dressed up for Halloween,

14:11.959 --> 14:13.959
you're just wearing your work clothes.

14:15.750 --> 14:17.458
That's kinda what I've been saying.

14:18.875 --> 14:20.959
Whose side are you on?

14:21.041 --> 14:24.125
And whatever you're cookin' over there--
It's hurtin' my nose.

14:25.542 --> 14:29.583
Yeah? Well, your face
is hurting my eyes, bozo.

14:30.875 --> 14:31.959
I have a name.

14:32.041 --> 14:33.959
Okay. What is your name?

14:34.041 --> 14:35.083
Boom-boom.

14:38.375 --> 14:39.500
And I’m Tinkles.

14:42.500 --> 14:44.208
Boom-boom and Tinkles?

14:44.250 --> 14:47.500
You sound like two things
my baby brother makes in his diaper.

14:48.583 --> 14:51.500
Hey! Nobody makes fun of my name!

14:51.583 --> 14:53.500
Sure we do. We got that whole bit

14:53.583 --> 14:56.125
- where we walk down the street--
- Shut up!

14:57.417 --> 14:59.834
This isn't over yet, missy.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.125
You messed with the wrong clowns.

15:02.875 --> 15:04.375
Oh.

15:04.458 --> 15:06.792
You know, it's a little hard
to be scared of somebody

15:06.875 --> 15:09.208
with green hair and a permanent smile!

15:09.291 --> 15:11.500
- Okay, that's enough.
- Just sayin', geez.

15:12.333 --> 15:14.834
Tinkles, Binky, Bo-bo,

15:15.083 --> 15:16.792
time to put on the big shoes.

15:16.875 --> 15:18.375
We got some work to do.

15:24.917 --> 15:28.458
I know sometimes Mrs. Dabney looks mean,

15:28.875 --> 15:31.417
but underneath that scowl,

15:32.166 --> 15:33.500
there's a frown.

15:35.166 --> 15:37.333
And underneath that frown,

15:37.834 --> 15:39.041
there's a grimace.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.959
And if you keep chipping

15:43.041 --> 15:46.417
and chipping and chipping,

15:46.500 --> 15:49.041
underneath that...

15:49.125 --> 15:50.583
You'll find a snarl.

15:53.917 --> 15:55.125
Move it along.

15:56.834 --> 15:58.250
And then,

15:58.333 --> 16:01.000
with just a little more chipping,

16:01.083 --> 16:03.250
underneath that,

16:03.500 --> 16:05.166
you'll find a smile.

16:06.959 --> 16:08.417
A smile...

16:09.166 --> 16:11.083
that has warmed my heart

16:12.792 --> 16:15.083
and changed my life forever.

16:17.166 --> 16:18.875
Thank you, Gabe.

16:20.667 --> 16:22.458
That was very moving.

16:22.875 --> 16:25.542
Now let's take a break for dessert.

16:27.041 --> 16:28.041
Well.

16:28.458 --> 16:30.875
Here's something I've never said before.

16:31.542 --> 16:32.959
You did good.

16:35.166 --> 16:36.291
Thank you.

16:36.375 --> 16:37.875
And I have to say,

16:37.959 --> 16:41.458
I admire you for scamming
these helpless old ladies.

16:42.625 --> 16:44.083
It was good, wasn't it?

16:45.250 --> 16:47.417
You know, we make a pretty good team.

16:47.500 --> 16:49.041
We do, don't we?

16:49.125 --> 16:50.583
We should team up again.

16:50.667 --> 16:51.834
Got any other scams?

16:51.917 --> 16:54.125
I might have a few.

16:55.917 --> 16:57.417
Mrs. Dabney,

16:57.500 --> 17:00.125
this may be the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

17:01.500 --> 17:03.333
Here's lookin' at you, kid.

17:12.083 --> 17:13.000
Trick or treat.

17:13.083 --> 17:14.291
Aww.

17:14.375 --> 17:16.917
Aren't you adorable? You're a bee.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.917
A bee who's got to be home by nine.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.709
Let's see some candy.

17:22.083 --> 17:24.500
Wow, this bee's got a stinger.

17:27.166 --> 17:29.792
"Uncle milt's honey globs"?

17:29.875 --> 17:31.667
Well, bees like honey, right?

17:31.750 --> 17:33.166
It's a costume, lady.

17:35.250 --> 17:36.458
Okay, see you next year!

17:36.542 --> 17:37.667
Doubt it.

17:44.041 --> 17:45.375
What the--!

17:47.625 --> 17:48.750
Hi, Mommy.

17:48.834 --> 17:50.041
There's a bat in the house.

17:50.125 --> 17:52.458
- A bat?
- It just flew in.

17:52.542 --> 17:54.458
Get it out, get it out, get it out!

17:54.542 --> 17:56.625
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

17:57.959 --> 17:59.875
This might be a job for Captain Extermo.

17:59.959 --> 18:01.542
You better ask him.

18:02.542 --> 18:03.542
Fine.

18:04.333 --> 18:07.125
Please help me, Captain Extermo.

18:07.667 --> 18:09.917
Now say my catchphrase.

18:10.250 --> 18:12.834
Captain Extermo, sleeping on the couch

18:12.917 --> 18:14.709
every night for the rest of his life.

18:15.917 --> 18:17.250
Close enough!

18:24.917 --> 18:26.917
And for your cheese course tonight...

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
fromage american.

18:31.875 --> 18:33.417
I think we'll skip the cheese course.

18:33.500 --> 18:34.667
Excellent choice.

18:38.291 --> 18:39.792
The cheese course is traditionally

18:39.875 --> 18:41.083
when you tip the accordion player.

18:41.166 --> 18:43.166
- Go away.
- Very good, madame.

18:44.500 --> 18:46.041
This is the last time I let you talk me

18:46.125 --> 18:48.500
into playing the accordion
for one of your fancy French dinners.

18:48.583 --> 18:50.166
It's probably the last time it'll come up.

18:52.542 --> 18:56.250
Now, um, I believe
someone owes me a moment.

18:56.625 --> 18:58.041
I believe I do.

19:00.125 --> 19:01.125
I’ll get it.

19:02.625 --> 19:04.458
Oh. Hey, look. The entertainment's here.

19:04.542 --> 19:06.041
I didn't order any entertainment.

19:06.125 --> 19:07.834
Well, someone did 'cause

19:07.917 --> 19:09.375
there's a whole mess of clowns out there.

19:09.458 --> 19:11.166
Clowns?

19:11.250 --> 19:12.542
No, don't open the door!

19:29.625 --> 19:32.500
Mrs. Dabney, I never imagined
our criminal partnership

19:32.583 --> 19:34.583
would be so successful.

19:35.792 --> 19:37.792
It's like we belong together.

19:37.875 --> 19:39.792
And we're gonna stay together.

19:39.875 --> 19:42.875
For a long long time.

19:58.083 --> 19:59.083
What are you doing here?

19:59.166 --> 20:00.875
I just had the worst dream of my life.

20:00.959 --> 20:02.291
- Were we dancing?
- Yes.

20:02.375 --> 20:03.792
- In handcuffs?
- Yes!

20:03.875 --> 20:05.375
What was that about?

20:06.291 --> 20:08.333
It's called a guilty conscience!

20:08.959 --> 20:10.667
We have to give that money back.

20:10.750 --> 20:11.959
Oh, you think?

20:13.166 --> 20:14.792
So I guess the partnership is over.

20:15.041 --> 20:17.542
Well, it was fun while it lasted.

20:17.625 --> 20:19.041
Mm.

20:19.875 --> 20:21.834
- Hug?
- Give mama some sugar.

20:21.917 --> 20:23.041
Aww.

20:30.542 --> 20:33.834
Mrs. Dabney, we have to give back
the money we stole.

20:35.125 --> 20:37.208
What do you mean, "Who is this?"

20:42.208 --> 20:44.709
Hey, Charlie. So, uh...

20:44.792 --> 20:47.125
Crazy Halloween for the Duncans.

20:47.208 --> 20:49.375
There was a bat in the house.

20:50.208 --> 20:52.625
Then for a short period of time,

20:52.709 --> 20:55.083
Gabe and Mrs. Dabney were friends.

20:56.458 --> 20:57.792
And then Spencer and i

20:57.875 --> 20:59.667
celebrated our one-year anniversary

20:59.750 --> 21:02.250
with a romantic dinner and...

21:02.375 --> 21:03.709
A clown attack.

21:04.959 --> 21:07.500
But it wasn't actually that bad.

21:07.583 --> 21:09.083
For me.

21:09.166 --> 21:11.166
Then again, I’m not afraid of clowns.

21:12.291 --> 21:14.166
Clowns in my house. Clowns in my house.

21:14.250 --> 21:15.667
Clowns in my house.

21:16.667 --> 21:18.959
Well, at least he's talking.

21:19.041 --> 21:20.250
Clowns in my house!

21:23.250 --> 21:24.458
Wish him good luck, Charlie.

21:29.333 --> 21:31.041
We've had a lot of fun here tonight,

21:31.125 --> 21:32.583
at the expense of clowns.

21:32.834 --> 21:34.166
But we're here to let you know that

21:34.250 --> 21:36.834
clowning is a very serious profession.

21:36.917 --> 21:39.125
One that takes years of training.

21:39.208 --> 21:41.333
And contrary to what you saw tonight,

21:41.417 --> 21:43.000
we are not a violent people.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.917
Ahh!

21:47.000 --> 21:48.917
We just wanna be treated
with the same love

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
and respect as everyone else.

21:57.792 --> 21:59.500
Stay in school, kids.
