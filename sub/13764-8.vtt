00:51.728 --> 00:54.067
<i>You've done everything
you can think of...</i>

00:55.035 --> 00:57.478
<i>and you're still no closer to home.</i>

00:58.250 --> 00:59.909
<i>Why are you still here, Sam?</i>

01:01.269 --> 01:03.251
I'm here for a reason.

01:16.082 --> 01:17.868
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:47.433 --> 01:50.556
870 to Alpha One,
that stabbing at the bookies,

01:50.614 --> 01:52.976
suspects are cornered
in at Winton Drive.

01:53.022 --> 01:54.197
Right, let's get it done.

01:54.267 --> 01:56.353
Unarmed? Those blokes
smashed a bookies clerk.

01:56.399 --> 01:58.899
We should sit tight.
Wait for uniform back-up...

02:01.768 --> 02:05.640
You wanna tell us who you work for and
we'll forget about this little incident?

02:05.802 --> 02:07.427
Come on! You want something?

02:07.485 --> 02:09.513
Do you wanna tell us
about the Morton brothers?

02:09.570 --> 02:11.621
Throw down your weapons.

02:12.071 --> 02:13.523
Nowhere to go, lads.

02:13.580 --> 02:15.597
They gotta give it up.
What else they gonna do?

02:15.689 --> 02:17.061
We're the Force.

02:17.280 --> 02:19.377
And may the Force be with you.

02:20.852 --> 02:22.039
Oh, damn.

02:35.899 --> 02:37.777
Clunk, click, every trip.

02:37.846 --> 02:40.958
Looks like the Mortons are pretty
serious about taking over this city.

02:42.255 --> 02:44.307
That's no way to treat a lady.

02:46.692 --> 02:50.622
Our best lead into a tasty new gang
and they end up as chopped liver.

02:50.737 --> 02:52.258
Now we've got nothing.

02:53.122 --> 02:55.173
I wouldn't say
we got "nothing" guv.

03:07.997 --> 03:10.982
Police. Hands on your
head and get on your knees.

03:11.455 --> 03:14.682
-You heard me.
-Hands, knees, bumps-a-daisy.

03:14.901 --> 03:16.779
I've paid for this room.

03:16.963 --> 03:18.093
Dad...

03:22.276 --> 03:24.362
Damn... I mean... damn!

03:38.650 --> 03:40.748
Daddy's gone away, Sammie.

03:41.462 --> 03:43.202
He didn't want to...

03:43.675 --> 03:45.207
but he had to.

03:46.281 --> 03:49.301
On the road again, just...
back on the road.

03:51.409 --> 03:52.988
But he loves us.

03:53.553 --> 03:54.913
And you'll see him again.

03:56.973 --> 03:58.840
Please... can I phone my wife?

04:15.003 --> 04:16.697
<i>My name is Sam Tyler.</i>

04:16.800 --> 04:19.808
<i>I had an accident
and I woke up in 1973.</i>

04:19.865 --> 04:23.357
<i>Am i mad? In a coma?
Or back in time?</i>

04:23.438 --> 04:26.860
<i>Whatever's happened, it's like
I've landed on a different planet.</i>

04:26.999 --> 04:30.618
<i>Now maybe if I can work out
a reason, I can get home.</i>

05:19.063 --> 05:21.564
<i>Daddy's gone away, Sammie.</i>

05:22.346 --> 05:24.080
<i>But he loves us...</i>

05:24.448 --> 05:26.581
<i>and you'll see him again.</i>

05:30.280 --> 05:31.952
Eager beaver.

05:32.075 --> 05:34.116
You're not gonna believe this.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.738
You know that bloke we
just brought in from the hotel?

05:38.889 --> 05:40.393
It's my dad.

05:41.038 --> 05:43.385
The suspect we just arrested?

05:43.769 --> 05:45.518
He's younger than you are!

05:45.595 --> 05:47.283
He's my dad!

05:47.682 --> 05:50.812
You know I've been searching
for an answer, why I'm here and...

05:50.905 --> 05:53.038
and how I get back.

05:54.341 --> 05:56.336
Maybe the answer's found me.

05:58.470 --> 06:00.112
Right. Shall we go and have words?

06:00.188 --> 06:02.060
I think we should
give him a few minutes.

06:02.106 --> 06:04.423
He's... um... feeling unwell.

06:04.477 --> 06:06.461
Shall I fetch him
some milk of magnesia?

06:06.510 --> 06:07.492
The bloke's innocent.

06:07.551 --> 06:09.515
We found nothing on him,
nothing in the room....

06:09.544 --> 06:12.314
Look at him. He was at the wrong
place at the wrong time, is all.

06:12.343 --> 06:14.111
Haven't you been paying
attention in class?

06:14.160 --> 06:16.556
Have you forgotten your place,
Detective *Constable*?

06:16.615 --> 06:20.239
You were the Boy Scout who wanted to
put Stephen Warren away. Remember?

06:20.887 --> 06:22.871
When a big old shark

06:23.627 --> 06:26.367
at the top of the
criminal ladder goes,

06:26.543 --> 06:28.792
the other smaller fish get excited.

06:28.959 --> 06:30.835
They wanna climb that ladder.

06:31.282 --> 06:33.406
This is a very mixed metaphor.

06:33.455 --> 06:35.026
Big shark has gone,

06:35.284 --> 06:38.119
and others wanna take over his
feeding ground and I'm telling you,

06:38.181 --> 06:40.710
I had no idea there
were so many fish in my pond.

06:40.783 --> 06:42.477
Can we just stop?

06:42.686 --> 06:45.006
Look, we've got a new gang in town,
the Mortons.

06:45.128 --> 06:47.412
They're looking to muscle
in on the gap left by Warren.

06:47.473 --> 06:50.015
Now, the Mortons were behind
the stabbing this morning

06:50.125 --> 06:53.992
and our only leads to them just went
through the front window of a Rover P6.

06:54.040 --> 06:55.734
What we're left with
is an innocent man,

06:55.796 --> 06:57.822
who for some reason,
we've taken into custody.

06:57.883 --> 07:00.179
We've got to crush this gang,
Sam, before they grow.

07:00.302 --> 07:04.399
You're wrong. Our only lead is
waiting for us in Lost and Found.

07:04.476 --> 07:06.722
Do you want me to go down
and warm him up for you, guv?

07:06.796 --> 07:10.565
Listen to me.
You touch one hair on his head...

07:11.522 --> 07:13.487
I'll talk to him first.

07:13.990 --> 07:15.942
-That's amazing.
-Go again?

07:16.016 --> 07:17.108
Go on.

07:19.453 --> 07:23.332
Round and round she goes,
where she stops...

07:24.769 --> 07:27.003
Well, that's a dead cert, that.

07:30.171 --> 07:33.632
Lesson for me there. Never try
to outsmart the copper's mind.

07:33.755 --> 07:37.352
Investigative brain, innit.
It's lava... lava...lavatorial.

07:37.413 --> 07:38.653
Lateral.

07:39.169 --> 07:41.342
Lateral thinking, Chris.

07:41.477 --> 07:42.901
Senior officer?

07:43.073 --> 07:44.559
Not that senior.

07:45.909 --> 07:48.328
You two related?
Both Tyler?

07:48.377 --> 07:51.851
-Ah, give over.
-Somebody call Esther Rantzen.

07:52.219 --> 07:55.461
Right, Mr Tyler.
D'you know the Mortons?

07:56.713 --> 07:59.217
Take a look at these two fellas.

07:59.954 --> 08:03.931
Jay Borrows and Danny Hutchins.
They both worked for them.

08:04.005 --> 08:06.055
I'm sorry sir, I've no idea.

08:06.126 --> 08:09.318
The Mortons are two-bit criminals
crawling around in the city,

08:09.395 --> 08:11.752
looking for their chance
to make it into the big time.

08:11.825 --> 08:15.262
Trouble is, moving into the big time
puts them squarely on my radar.

08:15.373 --> 08:19.289
They wanna get big.
Little fish becoming bigger fish.

08:19.341 --> 08:22.394
Need to feed, fast, and hard.

08:26.385 --> 08:29.669
The point is,
the Mortons are getting nasty

08:29.745 --> 08:33.443
and I'm gonna grind them
into the dirt. And you...

08:33.597 --> 08:35.408
You're gonna help me.

08:36.236 --> 08:40.779
I sell cleaning products. Door
to door. I work for a Mr Belmont.

08:40.856 --> 08:43.219
Regional supervisor.
You can call him.

08:45.981 --> 08:47.669
Don't worry, Mr Tyler.

08:47.745 --> 08:52.886
Just tell us exactly what you were doing
in Room 16 of the Victoria Park Hotel.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.854
I was hoping to land a school's
contract. I was getting changed...

08:55.946 --> 09:00.258
So you book into a hotel
four miles from your house.

09:00.342 --> 09:02.767
Good neutral ground
to meet a client.

09:02.859 --> 09:06.066
What, I suppose he wanted to test out
the tea-making facilities as well,

09:06.112 --> 09:07.877
but shall we ask him, Inspector?

09:07.939 --> 09:09.826
I'm a bit behind with the rent,

09:09.949 --> 09:13.601
trying to steer clear of
the landlord for a week or so.

09:13.709 --> 09:15.858
So you can't afford the rent,

09:16.011 --> 09:18.589
but you can afford to
splash out on hotel rooms.

09:18.712 --> 09:20.062
That's just an assumption.

09:20.124 --> 09:23.039
I'll make assumptions until
I get some answers, Mr Tyler,

09:23.193 --> 09:26.523
because do you know, by law,
how long I can keep you here?

09:27.410 --> 09:29.819
As long as I bloody well like.

09:36.387 --> 09:38.244
Let's start again.

09:41.482 --> 09:43.277
I play cards.

09:43.446 --> 09:45.641
The men in your photos...

09:45.687 --> 09:48.157
they were setting up
a game at the hotel.

09:48.280 --> 09:49.462
Here we go.

09:49.568 --> 09:52.683
But I'm not a crook.
It was just a card game.

09:52.776 --> 09:54.065
And the Morton brothers?

09:54.141 --> 09:56.566
No, no mention of any Mortons.

09:57.163 --> 10:01.184
Everyone was taking a room and
I wanted to keep up appearances.

10:01.644 --> 10:03.885
I was getting ready
when you lot turned up.

10:07.015 --> 10:10.805
So that's where your involvement ends?
You know nothing else about all this?

10:11.281 --> 10:14.780
So what're you saying? We
should let the gentleman go, Sam?

10:15.671 --> 10:17.819
I've got a young lad called Sam.

10:17.926 --> 10:20.873
I've got a pain in
the arse called Sam.

10:23.102 --> 10:25.557
What's he like, your... lad?

10:25.653 --> 10:28.626
Ah, he's always busy. Up here...

10:29.087 --> 10:33.192
You know what little nippers
are like. All that make-believe.

10:38.503 --> 10:42.508
Mr Belmont -Gateway Cleaning
Products -checks out.

10:44.073 --> 10:47.802
So he's a guy who likes a hand of cards
who fell in with the wrong crowd.

10:47.879 --> 10:49.214
Let's release him.

10:49.460 --> 10:53.036
Someone can... run him back.

10:53.511 --> 10:54.554
I could always...

10:54.631 --> 10:57.731
He might be Pippy
Longstocking in your eyes,

10:57.854 --> 11:00.109
but he's still the
only lead we've got.

11:00.232 --> 11:01.613
We search the house.

11:16.220 --> 11:18.294
You never phoned.
I was going spare.

11:18.338 --> 11:19.544
Sorry sweetheart.

11:19.942 --> 11:22.404
These policeman want to have
a quick look round the house.

11:22.455 --> 11:24.994
-It won't take two shakes.
-You.

11:26.062 --> 11:27.225
Have you met?

11:27.389 --> 11:30.004
-Inspector... Bolan?
-Tyler.

11:31.650 --> 11:34.969
We met in connection
with a burglary. And...

11:36.132 --> 11:39.538
I thought it might confuse you
if I gave you my real name, so...

11:39.802 --> 11:43.215
I adopted a professional alias.

11:44.529 --> 11:47.690
It's not a wind-up love,
he really thinks like this.

12:01.037 --> 12:02.967
The big hand always
sticks at twelve.

12:04.777 --> 12:06.393
I'll get it fixed.

12:06.531 --> 12:07.914
You never do.

12:13.765 --> 12:15.519
He works hard for us.

12:15.581 --> 12:17.241
He's always on the road, but...

12:17.485 --> 12:20.350
but the first thing he does when
he comes home, flowers for me and...

12:20.394 --> 12:22.116
A present for Sammie.

12:22.355 --> 12:27.057
When I was... little,
my dad worked away a fair bit.

12:28.119 --> 12:31.344
I used to look for the sight
of his jacket on the banister.

12:31.903 --> 12:35.554
It was the most exciting
thing in the world.

12:41.927 --> 12:45.257
I'm gonna go and
see if he's alright.

12:47.758 --> 12:49.768
What're you gonna charge me with?

12:49.876 --> 12:51.395
You haven't done anything.

12:51.625 --> 12:54.157
Do you mind if
I search your jacket?

12:54.264 --> 12:56.505
They've already done that,
at the...

12:59.006 --> 13:00.218
Why not?

13:20.375 --> 13:23.106
Well, that was a spectacular
waste of police time.

13:23.198 --> 13:24.518
Not entirely.

13:24.717 --> 13:26.290
His missus was a bit of alright.

13:26.367 --> 13:29.490
Wouldn't mind giving her a good old
going-over with the old tickling stick.

13:29.581 --> 13:31.285
Tattylarious.

13:31.408 --> 13:34.185
Don't, guv. Can we just
leave them in peace now, eh?

13:34.292 --> 13:35.766
I think she likes you though.

13:35.934 --> 13:37.576
Hey, you could slip her a length.

13:37.684 --> 13:39.602
You're a Tyler.
Keep it in the family.

13:41.382 --> 13:43.914
There's always something
if you know where to look.

13:46.859 --> 13:48.194
I know this.

13:48.287 --> 13:50.450
He used to read it to me.

13:50.558 --> 13:51.908
My dad, I mean.

13:52.092 --> 13:56.772
Little lad was using this
for a bookmark. Bookies receipt.

13:57.049 --> 13:57.908
So?

13:58.369 --> 14:01.791
Likes a flutter, visits
the bookies occasionally, so what?

14:01.883 --> 14:04.108
Gamblers move in tight circles.

14:04.246 --> 14:06.041
Maybe Vic Tyler knows nothing.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.113
But someone in his
little orbit might.

14:08.220 --> 14:10.614
Could be our only
link to the Mortons.

14:10.875 --> 14:12.563
It's a long shot.

14:13.545 --> 14:15.156
Trust the Gene Genie.

14:21.371 --> 14:25.558
Who's setting up card games
at the Victoria Park Hotel, Jimmy?

14:27.819 --> 14:29.418
I don't know nothing
about no game.

14:29.480 --> 14:31.249
Step into my office.

14:33.163 --> 14:36.343
Mr Hunt, you know if there's
stuff to tell, I'll tell it!

14:36.509 --> 14:38.681
Victoria Park Hotel, nothing doing.

14:38.737 --> 14:39.733
Mortons.

14:40.260 --> 14:41.323
The brothers?

14:42.432 --> 14:45.085
I know of them.
Well, the races.

14:45.197 --> 14:47.693
Tic-tac man with a bit
of funds's what I've heard.

14:49.911 --> 14:52.855
The snooker club, Watling Road.
There's action there, okay?

14:52.956 --> 14:55.184
The Morton brothers have got
something going on.

14:55.318 --> 14:57.075
More than card games.

15:00.573 --> 15:01.816
Ding dong.

15:02.140 --> 15:03.730
Avon calling.

15:09.613 --> 15:10.732
What's this?

15:10.833 --> 15:14.136
Public information film on
the dangers of inhaling goose down?

15:15.670 --> 15:18.525
"Once Upon a Time in her Vest"?

15:18.871 --> 15:23.137
You dare to pollute the glorious
genre of the American western?

15:25.533 --> 15:27.515
Are the Mortons here?
I wanna say hello.

15:27.571 --> 15:29.127
-Don't know who you mean.
-'Course.

15:29.194 --> 15:30.873
But I'm sure somebody here does.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.161
What's this one?

15:32.699 --> 15:34.177
"French Letter Connection"?

15:34.278 --> 15:36.998
"A Fistful of Donnas,
and a Few Donnas More".

15:37.043 --> 15:39.428
If Sergio Leone knew
what they were doing...

15:39.528 --> 15:43.021
The Morton brothers are funding
and distributing hardcore porno.

15:43.066 --> 15:45.294
Hardcore.
I've seen worse on Channel Four.

15:45.361 --> 15:48.059
Yeah, well, I find the idea of
watching a bird brushing her teeth

15:48.137 --> 15:51.115
on some bloke's John Thomas
less than exotic, kill it.

15:51.215 --> 15:53.757
None of the blokes from
the snooker club are talking, guv.

15:53.801 --> 15:54.988
No formal ID, anyroad.

15:55.055 --> 15:56.824
And they're scared,
no doubt about it.

15:56.880 --> 15:58.190
There's big money in porno.

15:58.235 --> 16:00.843
Enough to fund any project
these bastards feel like

16:00.922 --> 16:03.396
and ruin the lives of more
people like Vic and his family.

16:03.440 --> 16:05.478
That's why we need
to nail the brothers Grimm

16:05.523 --> 16:08.635
before they blight this town
like a dose of Colorado beetle.

16:08.680 --> 16:10.773
Am I still getting my
whatsits mixed up, Gladys?

16:10.863 --> 16:12.822
No, that was a simile,
you're alright.

16:12.889 --> 16:14.009
Anything else to add?

16:14.087 --> 16:17.647
Yeah, I need volunteers to go through
these films with a fine-tooth comb.

16:21.016 --> 16:23.647
I'll just stick to the
fun stuff then, shall I?

16:30.782 --> 16:33.032
What've you got,
my little deputy-dawg?

16:33.099 --> 16:35.450
This is the only
number we've found.

16:37.924 --> 16:39.939
It's probably a sex chatline.

16:39.995 --> 16:41.260
A what?

16:43.164 --> 16:44.026
Hello.

16:44.351 --> 16:46.982
Sam Tyler speaking.
Can I help you?

16:52.512 --> 16:54.370
And? Any chat?

16:55.953 --> 16:56.838
Nothing.

16:57.891 --> 16:59.290
Well, who answered?

16:59.682 --> 17:03.309
It was a... dead line.
Number unobtainable.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.280
It's either a dead line
or number unobtainable.

17:05.325 --> 17:08.400
Can you just get on with
whatever it is you're doing, Chris?

17:17.861 --> 17:20.135
<i>Daddy's gone away, Sammie.</i>

17:20.678 --> 17:22.164
<i>He didn't want to...</i>

17:22.970 --> 17:24.387
<i>but he had to.</i>

17:25.104 --> 17:26.643
<i>But he loves us.</i>

17:27.203 --> 17:28.830
<i>And you'll see him again.</i>

17:31.821 --> 17:33.920
Why did you leave us, Dad?

17:36.054 --> 17:37.716
Where did you go?

17:50.714 --> 17:53.198
<i>...and we've seen a marked
improvement in Sam's condition.</i>

17:53.268 --> 17:56.767
<i>No doubt about that as we watch
his vital signs begin to stabilise.</i>

17:56.941 --> 17:59.915
<i>We've recorded a significant
increase in brain activity recently,</i>

17:59.985 --> 18:02.120
<i>a crucial step towards
regaining consciousness.</i>

18:02.225 --> 18:04.726
<i>And as they close
into the final furlong...</i>

18:08.680 --> 18:11.916
You're supposed to be looking at ladies'
boobs through a magnifying glass.

18:12.003 --> 18:13.070
My dad's caught up in it.

18:13.154 --> 18:16.628
He's got himself mixed up with
the Mortons, or at least, somebody...

18:17.029 --> 18:18.885
connected with them...

18:19.444 --> 18:22.768
-Can't you have an ordinary day?
-Maybe that's why he went away.

18:22.875 --> 18:25.053
Maybe he was running
away from them.

18:25.232 --> 18:28.714
My dad walked out on
us at a family wedding,

18:28.857 --> 18:31.680
round about this time.
I never found him.

18:31.751 --> 18:33.736
Not a trace. Thirty years.

18:35.222 --> 18:38.706
Maybe he was scared of the Mortons
and that's why he left us.

18:38.760 --> 18:40.417
Or will leave us.

18:41.214 --> 18:43.140
Maybe that's why I'm here.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.651
To stop him from leaving.

18:47.950 --> 18:50.288
History's repeating itself,

18:50.681 --> 18:52.204
but I can change it.

18:53.037 --> 18:54.855
So what're you gonna do?

18:55.643 --> 18:56.718
Save him.

18:56.977 --> 18:58.894
And that will save me.

18:59.019 --> 19:01.801
My mate's got one of these at home.
It's got sound.

19:01.906 --> 19:03.253
Runs cartoons.

19:03.358 --> 19:05.474
It's like the cinema
in your living room.

19:05.579 --> 19:07.661
Get your popcorn and watch this.

19:11.964 --> 19:13.940
See that? Go back.

19:22.558 --> 19:25.374
Just a bloke in the
wrong hotel room, eh?

19:31.375 --> 19:33.334
You're in it up to your neck.

19:33.509 --> 19:36.185
Now, either you give me
the names of the men you work for

19:36.255 --> 19:38.215
or I'm do you up
for peddling pornography.

19:38.250 --> 19:40.785
-I wanna help, but...
-Trust us.

19:48.466 --> 19:51.959
He was the one who put me
in touch with those other men.

19:56.413 --> 19:58.884
Don't be scared, okay? We can help.

19:59.754 --> 20:01.277
I love my wife.

20:03.641 --> 20:07.558
I'm not into that...
filth that they make.

20:08.544 --> 20:10.595
You can't run away from this.

20:11.685 --> 20:12.384
I...

20:13.208 --> 20:13.951
We...

20:14.542 --> 20:16.172
...can get you out of it.

20:19.758 --> 20:23.135
I didn't know I was playing
cards with gangsters.

20:23.837 --> 20:25.548
Not until I couldn't pay.

20:27.732 --> 20:29.685
I tried to talk my
way out of it, but...

20:31.637 --> 20:34.100
but when they blindfolded me,
I thought...

20:34.987 --> 20:36.438
I thought my number was up.

20:38.095 --> 20:39.805
They took me to this...

20:39.949 --> 20:41.982
this place where they were
making the film and...

20:43.039 --> 20:44.785
girls with no shame.

20:46.281 --> 20:51.824
But I refused to show them
my disgust or my fear.

20:52.146 --> 20:53.199
Good for you.

20:54.355 --> 20:56.710
And then they said that
the brothers, the Mortons,

20:57.024 --> 20:59.764
wanted me to sell
the film around the city.

20:59.827 --> 21:03.956
What better cover than
a real-life travelling saleman?

21:04.045 --> 21:05.828
Did you meet the Mortons?

21:05.971 --> 21:08.613
No, it was always done
through somebody else.

21:08.908 --> 21:10.816
Why did you agree to do it?

21:10.905 --> 21:13.126
Because they were gonna hurt Ruth.

21:13.341 --> 21:14.971
And my little Sammie.

21:17.838 --> 21:19.181
After I'd finished,

21:19.280 --> 21:22.513
I waited at the
hotel for their visit,

21:22.692 --> 21:25.182
and I thought it was all over.

21:27.296 --> 21:29.419
But... then you were there.

21:37.304 --> 21:39.982
Whether you were coerced or not,

21:41.488 --> 21:43.789
you're in a bit of a pickle, Vic.

21:44.300 --> 21:45.769
Question is,

21:46.432 --> 21:48.304
what are we gonna do about it?

21:54.467 --> 21:56.957
Sorry, I'm not very
good with ink pens.

21:57.119 --> 21:59.035
Plus, I'm shaking.

21:59.842 --> 22:01.499
He's just nervous, Phyllis.

22:01.543 --> 22:02.941
Thought he had palsy.

22:03.110 --> 22:04.517
So, what now?

22:05.495 --> 22:07.927
The Mortons need to
think you've been released

22:07.962 --> 22:09.837
and they'll wanna
know what you said to us,

22:09.882 --> 22:11.772
so they're gonna
try and arrange a meet.

22:12.264 --> 22:15.752
So go home, wait for the call.
It'll come, okay.

22:16.585 --> 22:20.357
And don't look so worried! You've got
Manchester's finest looking after you.

22:21.432 --> 22:24.325
Well, piss and get off the pot
then. You're clogging up my area.

22:49.531 --> 22:53.205
870 to Alpha One.
He's leaving the house now.

22:55.181 --> 22:56.090
You okay?

22:56.178 --> 22:57.945
Yeah, only sleepless night.

22:58.032 --> 22:59.694
Someone's just called.

22:59.764 --> 23:02.545
Who?
Did they give a name?

23:02.738 --> 23:04.295
-Recognise the voice?
-No.

23:04.382 --> 23:08.143
There's a phone box on Winslow Green.
I've got to wait there for instructions.

23:22.168 --> 23:23.987
All this cat and mouse.

23:24.127 --> 23:25.789
Usual form.

23:26.192 --> 23:28.186
They just wanna keep you rattled.

23:28.903 --> 23:30.670
They're doing a good job.

23:33.066 --> 23:36.442
All I ever wanted was
security for my family.

23:36.669 --> 23:38.874
You don't get security
playing poker.

23:38.961 --> 23:41.672
And you don't get
rich selling mopheads.

23:44.752 --> 23:45.819
Sorry.

23:46.501 --> 23:49.807
I just wanna give my family
the life that they deserve.

23:50.962 --> 23:52.641
I'd give anything for that.

23:58.623 --> 24:00.914
How long's this gonna take?

24:02.262 --> 24:04.641
Ten minutes, three hours...

24:04.868 --> 24:06.425
We just sit here...

24:16.254 --> 24:17.828
I've got a...

24:18.003 --> 24:21.082
There's some in the boot,
we could...

24:22.587 --> 24:24.423
Just to kill time.

25:00.521 --> 25:02.288
On your head, my son!

25:28.475 --> 25:29.910
The Mortons want to meet me.

25:30.079 --> 25:32.327
Snooker club, one hour.

25:32.811 --> 25:35.963
I've done what you wanted,
I don't need to be there, do I?

25:36.044 --> 25:37.540
I'm afraid you do, yeah.

25:37.871 --> 25:41.453
They're gonna wait for you to
go inside before they make a move.

25:41.579 --> 25:43.854
Do this and they're finished.

25:44.553 --> 25:46.532
You'll have nothing else to fear.

25:48.305 --> 25:49.416
Don't worry.

25:50.097 --> 25:53.034
I'll be looking out for you,
I swear.

25:55.076 --> 25:55.820
Come on.

26:12.782 --> 26:15.048
Nice and steady, good man.

26:18.663 --> 26:20.302
He might be in there a while.

26:20.427 --> 26:22.262
So when we go in there,
keep it tight.

26:22.298 --> 26:24.358
Don't start throwing
your fists around.

26:24.520 --> 26:26.266
Remember,
there's a civilian in there.

26:26.374 --> 26:27.565
Right you are, boss.

26:30.507 --> 26:32.191
New aftershave, Ray?

26:32.603 --> 26:33.168
What?

26:35.263 --> 26:36.302
Clingon.

26:37.673 --> 26:39.204
Lucky Wilma.

26:40.557 --> 26:41.954
Going alright, is it?

26:42.205 --> 26:43.244
I dunno.

26:43.378 --> 26:45.214
She goes on about her origami.

26:45.304 --> 26:48.161
Like that programme they run
at lunchtime on the telly.

26:48.913 --> 26:50.919
I just try and picture her
without her top on.

26:50.982 --> 26:53.051
Would you three just shut your...

27:01.109 --> 27:02.631
Oh my god.

27:02.963 --> 27:04.512
Ray. Check the back door.

27:06.109 --> 27:06.772
Vic.

27:18.843 --> 27:19.488
No...

27:33.914 --> 27:35.302
Are you okay? What happened?

27:35.320 --> 27:36.789
They were upstairs.

27:37.192 --> 27:40.632
They were already here, see,
and I heard them and I hid back.

27:40.679 --> 27:42.848
-The Mortons?
-It must have been them.

27:42.953 --> 27:45.227
I couldn't see,
I had my eyes shut.

27:45.333 --> 27:48.412
You gotta get me out of this nightmare
otherwise I'm gone, right now.

27:48.517 --> 27:50.843
No, I mean it, Sam. I'm gone.

27:54.219 --> 27:56.928
I'm moving Vic and his family
to a place of safety.

27:56.963 --> 27:58.606
-You're kidding.
-When I'm kidding,

27:58.629 --> 28:00.083
my bow tie starts spinning round.

28:00.135 --> 28:02.201
I'll take him to the station
and put him in a cell.

28:02.223 --> 28:05.044
He's an eye-witness to a double murder
and I wanna know what he saw.

28:05.073 --> 28:07.452
Which is why he's top
of the Mortons' hit list.

28:07.483 --> 28:10.137
You were bang-on, Gene, they
are gunning for the big prize.

28:10.182 --> 28:12.625
They won't stop now.
Look what they did to Jimmy Lips,

28:12.659 --> 28:14.172
just for talking to us.

28:14.224 --> 28:16.206
We'll put Vic in custody,
they can't get him.

28:16.238 --> 28:17.631
They can still
get to his family.

28:17.660 --> 28:19.631
-You're not running this.
-I am now.

28:20.897 --> 28:22.961
You're not gonna
ruin this for me, Hunt.

28:24.586 --> 28:27.160
I think you've forgotten
who you're talking to.

28:28.090 --> 28:30.183
An overweight, over the hill,

28:30.217 --> 28:34.177
nicotine-stained,
borderline alcoholic homophobe

28:34.212 --> 28:37.015
with a superiority complex...

28:37.359 --> 28:39.955
and an unhealthy obsession
with male bonding.

28:40.901 --> 28:43.870
You make that sound
like a bad thing.

28:44.047 --> 28:46.286
I've gotta save him, Gene.

28:47.862 --> 28:49.051
Guv!

29:00.467 --> 29:01.224
Key.

29:02.795 --> 29:04.050
What was that, Jimmy?

29:05.018 --> 29:05.678
Key.

29:11.606 --> 29:14.120
Even in death you're rubbish,
aren't you, Jimmy?

29:22.418 --> 29:23.805
Get after him, Tyler.

29:44.241 --> 29:46.023
Mum! Dad!

29:49.269 --> 29:51.767
Don't you think we should
just get on and search the place?

29:51.809 --> 29:53.265
We won't find anything.

29:53.328 --> 29:54.841
We're under orders, Sam.

29:58.251 --> 30:00.148
My mum and dad are gone, Annie.

30:01.908 --> 30:03.432
They're not your parents.

30:06.942 --> 30:09.055
How did I know where the key was?

30:09.277 --> 30:10.481
What does that prove?

30:11.290 --> 30:14.637
Lots of folk leave the
doorkey under the dustbin.

30:17.862 --> 30:20.123
Okay. Open that box.

30:20.598 --> 30:23.172
It'll play the Blue Danube,
by Strauss.

30:36.635 --> 30:37.140
See?

30:38.181 --> 30:40.205
You've searched this house before.

30:43.639 --> 30:44.831
I've gotta find him.

30:46.835 --> 30:47.626
Where is he?

30:58.641 --> 30:59.386
Yes.

31:00.606 --> 31:03.523
My dad gave me this cigarette card.

31:04.119 --> 31:07.208
Signed. Bobby Charlton.
Very special.

31:08.602 --> 31:10.436
I keep this card...

31:11.107 --> 31:13.061
my entire life.

31:14.779 --> 31:15.467
So...

31:17.095 --> 31:18.706
he's gotta come back.

31:21.194 --> 31:21.842
He has to.

31:21.888 --> 31:24.003
You must see a psychiatrist.

31:26.172 --> 31:28.016
You never recovered
from the accident,

31:28.047 --> 31:31.825
and I knew it, and I just
ignored it, and it hurts me...

31:32.312 --> 31:34.554
to see you suffering so much.

31:34.605 --> 31:37.196
Sanest lunatic you ever met.

31:43.619 --> 31:45.505
He's not coming back, Sam.

31:50.305 --> 31:51.884
I'm gonna get help for you.

31:53.672 --> 31:55.511
I should have done it weeks ago.

32:23.038 --> 32:25.680
Oh my godfathers.

32:29.475 --> 32:31.032
I thought you were them.

32:31.120 --> 32:32.382
Why did you run away?

32:32.454 --> 32:34.514
Because your boss
was gonna arrest me

32:34.550 --> 32:37.765
and how can I look after my
family from inside a police cell?

32:41.060 --> 32:44.007
You'd risk your life
for a cigarette card.

32:45.198 --> 32:47.196
Because it means...

32:47.840 --> 32:49.614
too much to my son.

32:50.904 --> 32:53.617
Imagine what it'd do
to him if you disappeared.

32:53.976 --> 32:57.093
-I'm bad news.
-Not to him you're not.

32:58.446 --> 32:59.735
Who are you?

33:01.276 --> 33:02.718
Second chance.

33:06.946 --> 33:08.567
You wanna be rich?

33:09.498 --> 33:12.257
You don't realise, do you?
You already are.

33:13.305 --> 33:15.562
Stay with them, Vic.

33:24.267 --> 33:25.333
You're right.

33:31.168 --> 33:33.022
If I leave them, then...

33:33.202 --> 33:34.778
I've lost them anyway.

33:35.092 --> 33:36.480
The Mortons've won.

33:36.654 --> 33:38.430
Trust me to protect
you from the Mortons.

33:38.476 --> 33:40.416
They'll be in custody very soon.

33:40.548 --> 33:44.099
Why are you going to such
great lengths to... to help me?

33:44.747 --> 33:46.322
I'm a policeman.

33:57.197 --> 33:58.800
Thanks, Sam.

34:01.542 --> 34:03.118
You're welcome. Vic.

34:05.461 --> 34:06.975
I'll stay with them.

34:32.266 --> 34:33.655
That's it, I've done it.

34:34.165 --> 34:35.679
I've done it, he's staying.

34:36.915 --> 34:38.697
That's it, wakey-wakey!

34:38.768 --> 34:40.945
<i>Doctor... he moved.</i>

34:40.989 --> 34:42.065
Too right he moved!

34:42.110 --> 34:45.235
He's sorted it all out in his head
and now he's coming home!

34:46.168 --> 34:47.270
<i>Get the team in here.</i>

34:47.322 --> 34:49.257
Yeah, get 'em in, get 'em all in.

34:49.311 --> 34:51.022
Gather round for the big waking up!

34:51.076 --> 34:53.001
gather round, game on!

34:53.145 --> 34:56.179
I'm gonna kiss every
one of you beautiful people!

34:56.297 --> 34:57.936
Assume the position!

35:36.848 --> 35:38.344
<i>Where are you?</i>

35:54.036 --> 35:55.549
<i>I thought I'd done it.</i>

35:57.144 --> 35:59.088
<i>I thought he was gonna stay.</i>

36:01.689 --> 36:03.857
<i>It's gonna happen all over again.</i>

36:05.388 --> 36:06.480
And now...

36:08.800 --> 36:10.430
I don't know where he's gone.

36:10.484 --> 36:13.215
-You lost a suspect?
-No, I lost my...

36:15.248 --> 36:16.458
He could be anywhere.

36:16.712 --> 36:20.661
Sounds to me like you need
to be cut a break, mon brave.

36:20.750 --> 36:23.142
-He could be in danger.
-Who's in danger?

36:23.196 --> 36:26.178
I've gotta stop him from
leaving him and I don't know how.

36:26.276 --> 36:28.533
What everyone good
barman knows is...

36:28.596 --> 36:30.486
the beer ain't tasting good,

36:30.620 --> 36:32.241
it ain't a problem with the tap.

36:32.349 --> 36:34.140
It's a problem in the barrel.

36:34.283 --> 36:36.128
Get to the root
of the problem, Sam.

36:44.692 --> 36:46.259
What the hell are you doing here?

36:46.304 --> 36:47.101
Drinking.

36:47.164 --> 36:49.233
No, what are you doing here?

36:49.386 --> 36:50.245
Tell me Gene.

36:50.326 --> 36:53.174
Why are you sharing this
little adventure with me?

36:53.228 --> 36:56.049
You know,
you talk a big game about leaving,

36:56.255 --> 36:59.542
but maybe this is more your
cup of tea than you care to admit.

36:59.587 --> 37:01.969
I told you before,
I've got nowhere else to go.

37:02.032 --> 37:04.996
And I told you before, you wanted
to come here in the first place.

37:05.059 --> 37:06.518
Where's Vic Tyler?

37:06.706 --> 37:09.062
Let's leave Vic Tyler
out of it, eh?

37:09.572 --> 37:10.441
Key.

37:11.345 --> 37:14.426
Jimmy Lips' last word.
What does it mean?

37:16.628 --> 37:18.131
No ideas?

37:18.399 --> 37:21.769
Come on, brainbox.
This is our only chance here.

37:22.273 --> 37:23.516
Only chance?

37:23.616 --> 37:25.340
To nip it in the bud
and get the Mortons

37:25.421 --> 37:28.476
before they destroy
many more families' lives.

37:33.224 --> 37:35.515
Did you find a key on him?

37:36.495 --> 37:39.346
There's a Key Hugh
Lane in Levenshulme.

37:39.504 --> 37:42.145
Did a drive-by, nothing.

37:44.682 --> 37:45.626
Code?

37:48.320 --> 37:50.227
Where do they operate from?

37:50.437 --> 37:54.127
Well, we know they operate card
games in the red light district.

37:54.285 --> 37:57.958
Plod reckons they've been running
dog-fights down by the canal.

38:00.379 --> 38:01.358
Canal.

38:02.565 --> 38:03.527
So?

38:05.224 --> 38:07.218
They know the wharfs.

38:07.656 --> 38:09.685
Maybe we got the wrong spelling.

38:10.175 --> 38:11.155
Quay.

38:22.631 --> 38:24.695
Police. Stay where you are.

38:24.835 --> 38:26.707
You're nicked, sonny.

38:27.739 --> 38:30.030
See you've got your
vicars in a twist.

38:32.391 --> 38:33.423
Where are they?

38:33.807 --> 38:37.377
Right. One of you is happily
gonna spill his guts to us.

38:37.568 --> 38:39.125
They're not here.

38:39.230 --> 38:41.486
Just relax.
We've got plenty to go on.

38:41.591 --> 38:44.740
-Somebody's bound to talk.
-There's no time!

38:49.313 --> 38:50.328
Here.

38:51.727 --> 38:54.509
Looks like they've been thinking up
titles. Listen to this.

38:54.579 --> 38:56.537
"On Her Majesty's Secret Cervix".

38:56.624 --> 38:59.353
Guv. We've been flashing
the photos around.

38:59.493 --> 39:00.997
Vic Tyler got a reaction.

39:01.540 --> 39:03.884
Why're you showing
photographs of Vic Tyler?

39:04.024 --> 39:07.015
We should be going after the
Mortons, the root of the problem!

39:07.102 --> 39:10.566
I've got a hunch about Vic Tyler
and it looks like it's paying off.

39:10.653 --> 39:12.717
He told us he'd been
on a film shoot.

39:12.770 --> 39:15.901
Not on this one.
Do you know what I'm thinking?

39:16.041 --> 39:17.650
He's been to a few.

39:17.860 --> 39:20.694
I knew that bloke was yanking
our chain. He's involved with them.

39:20.782 --> 39:23.633
Ray, get an APB on Vic Tyler.

39:23.721 --> 39:26.642
Bus stations,
railway stations, the works.

39:26.712 --> 39:30.507
You're barking up the wrong tree.
He's innocent.

39:30.696 --> 39:33.565
We should be going after
the men who drove him away.

39:33.618 --> 39:36.445
Tyler's involved! We pull him in
and don't let him out of our sight

39:36.501 --> 39:38.390
until we get some bloody answers!

39:38.464 --> 39:39.706
You're gonna stitch him up.

39:39.793 --> 39:42.102
-There's a thought.
-You are, aren't you?

39:42.347 --> 39:45.373
If you do that, he'll bolt
for good, and then it's over.

39:45.426 --> 39:47.437
-No it's not.
-For me it is!

39:47.525 --> 39:51.671
I really need you to help me find
him! We've no idea of where he is!

39:55.811 --> 39:57.543
Or where he's gonna be...

39:57.648 --> 39:58.645
What?

40:00.464 --> 40:03.175
-Where do you think you're going?
-Get out of my way.

40:03.263 --> 40:06.062
You're staying right here with me
where I can keep an eye on you.

40:06.464 --> 40:08.668
-Don't!
-You are my DI.

40:08.791 --> 40:10.785
Now you act like it!

40:30.748 --> 40:34.194
<i>My dad walked out
on us at a family wedding,</i>

40:34.334 --> 40:36.381
<i>roundabout this time.</i>

40:37.063 --> 40:40.457
<i>I never found him. Not a trace.</i>

42:41.870 --> 42:45.445
DCI Hunt, can you hear me?
There's no sign of DI Tyler,

42:45.498 --> 42:47.947
but he was right about Vic
coming to the wedding reception.

42:48.034 --> 42:49.819
He's just left the hall, over.

42:49.941 --> 42:51.480
Can you hear me?

42:51.743 --> 42:54.770
Look, I know what you said,
but I'm going after him.

42:56.274 --> 42:57.813
Excuse me.

42:59.700 --> 43:01.817
Have you seen my daddy?

43:02.097 --> 43:04.284
I need to find my daddy.

43:05.018 --> 43:06.907
Go back inside.

43:07.467 --> 43:09.514
I'm gonna go and get him.

43:38.226 --> 43:39.818
Where are you?

43:44.660 --> 43:46.304
<i>Where are you?</i>

43:48.980 --> 43:50.660
<i>Daddy, where are you?</I></i>

43:58.005 --> 43:59.579
Can you hear me, Sam?

44:00.471 --> 44:01.888
Please come in.

44:03.165 --> 44:04.564
I can hear you.

44:06.243 --> 44:07.643
I'm a police officer.

44:07.713 --> 44:10.896
Ok well, leave me in peace, please.
Don't wanna be involved.

44:11.001 --> 44:14.080
-You are involved already, sir.
-What have I done?

44:16.145 --> 44:19.118
All I wanted was
to keep my family safe.

44:19.678 --> 44:20.657
Provide for them.

44:20.710 --> 44:22.896
You can discuss all
this with DCI Hunt.

44:22.966 --> 44:26.850
They planted you like
a little CID stooge.

44:27.479 --> 44:30.873
Waiting for me.
Spying on my family.

44:30.978 --> 44:33.147
Well, you got no right.
It's my life.

44:33.252 --> 44:35.684
It's <i>my</i> life!

44:36.751 --> 44:38.063
Give me that radio.

44:47.843 --> 44:50.082
Wait! Vic.

44:51.131 --> 44:53.073
You don't have to run anymore.

44:54.367 --> 44:56.238
I can protect you.

44:58.390 --> 45:01.346
-Victor Tyler, I'm arresting you...
-Wait, Annie.

45:07.523 --> 45:09.028
What's this for?

45:10.602 --> 45:13.139
In case they found me, the Mortons.

45:13.279 --> 45:14.923
I could turn it on 'em.

45:15.360 --> 45:16.812
Or on myself.

45:17.547 --> 45:18.771
Let me have it, Sam.

45:18.841 --> 45:20.748
I can protect you!

45:20.923 --> 45:22.427
And your family.

45:22.742 --> 45:24.649
They're better off without me.

45:24.754 --> 45:28.008
No, Vic, they need you.
You have to stay.

45:28.183 --> 45:29.862
Vic, please.

45:30.647 --> 45:31.994
If I stay,

45:33.726 --> 45:35.388
I'll need to protect 'em.

45:35.527 --> 45:36.822
Don't, Sam.

45:39.008 --> 45:40.023
You stay?

45:44.991 --> 45:47.562
-I promise.
-Sam! Don't!

45:49.871 --> 45:52.827
Don't you move a muscle,
you scummy bastard.

45:54.839 --> 45:56.291
Sam, step back.

45:56.378 --> 45:57.585
What're you doing?

45:57.638 --> 45:59.579
Do you wanna tell him,
Vic, or shall I?

45:59.736 --> 46:00.961
Tell him what?

46:01.188 --> 46:05.124
A known associate of the Mortons
had Vic's hotel room details

46:05.211 --> 46:08.097
We've got film that shows
he was at a porno shoot.

46:08.167 --> 46:09.847
He was at the snooker club,

46:10.127 --> 46:12.734
where we found Jimmy
Lips and the manager dead.

46:12.839 --> 46:15.130
Guv, this is...

46:15.777 --> 46:18.699
There was no one at the club, Sam.
Just him.

46:18.856 --> 46:21.585
We've only got his word that
the Morton brothers were there.

46:21.742 --> 46:25.328
We never searched him.
He could've had a gun himself.

46:25.555 --> 46:28.372
Oh my sweet godfathers,
you think what?

46:28.424 --> 46:30.594
We've got no formal
ID on the brothers.

46:30.699 --> 46:32.833
Never crossed our
minds that one man...

46:32.920 --> 46:35.544
could be pretending to be two men.

46:35.947 --> 46:38.011
You're not gonna set him up, Gene.

46:38.081 --> 46:39.410
I don't need to, Sam.

46:39.585 --> 46:42.664
Forget logic,
what does that tell you?

46:42.856 --> 46:46.284
He's rotten, Sam.
We've got to bring him in.

46:52.809 --> 46:54.943
Now that's an odd thing to do.

46:55.118 --> 46:57.252
You don't want me to leave.

46:58.804 --> 47:02.023
But I have to leave, Gene.

47:04.297 --> 47:06.431
He's under stress, sir.

47:07.393 --> 47:10.786
I'm not exactly dozing
in a deckchair myself, here.

47:19.255 --> 47:20.585
Listen to me.

47:20.672 --> 47:22.649
Write it down, I'll read it later.

47:42.161 --> 47:43.210
Dad.

47:49.161 --> 47:50.263
Stop.

47:53.009 --> 47:55.913
You understand.
You know what the police are like.

47:56.385 --> 47:58.939
They need to solve cases,
they'll do anything to...

47:59.132 --> 48:00.566
Don't leave.

48:01.073 --> 48:02.454
I'm begging you.

48:02.559 --> 48:05.708
You can't protect me Sam.
Not even from your own DCI.

48:05.778 --> 48:06.706
I can.

48:07.598 --> 48:09.050
I can save you.

48:09.224 --> 48:10.728
But you have to stay,

48:10.799 --> 48:14.219
together with your family,
the way it was supposed to be.

48:14.341 --> 48:17.333
I'll need to feel
safe if I stay, Sam.

48:21.095 --> 48:22.145
Please.

48:23.631 --> 48:25.346
Give me the gun.

48:28.302 --> 48:30.436
I'll stay if you give me the gun.

48:35.124 --> 48:36.541
<i>Come on, Sam.</i>

48:37.014 --> 48:38.273
<i>Come on.</i>

48:38.570 --> 48:40.372
<i>He's waking up.</i>

48:43.668 --> 48:45.610
You're so close.

48:50.508 --> 48:52.449
You can do it, Sam.

48:52.624 --> 48:55.100
<i>Come on, Sam, come on.</i>

49:39.423 --> 49:41.032
I had to know.

49:43.516 --> 49:45.335
I had to be sure.

49:51.509 --> 49:52.873
I saw it.

49:54.483 --> 49:57.876
It was a memory
from when I was four.

49:59.118 --> 50:01.515
You out here in the woods.

50:02.495 --> 50:04.751
The woman in the red dress.

50:06.109 --> 50:08.068
She was a police officer.

50:10.238 --> 50:12.127
And you struck her down...

50:12.389 --> 50:15.275
and you kicked
her and kicked her...

50:16.045 --> 50:19.543
and then you fled.
And I saw it all.

50:21.153 --> 50:23.042
I blocked it out.

50:24.914 --> 50:26.610
Until I came here.

50:34.685 --> 50:36.364
Victor Tyler,

50:37.675 --> 50:39.617
you are under arrest for murder,

50:39.687 --> 50:42.643
and for obtaining monies by
the manufacture and distribution

50:42.748 --> 50:46.509
of material banned by the
1967 Obscene Publications Act.

50:46.579 --> 50:47.944
Fine.

50:49.326 --> 50:50.708
Fair cop.

50:52.842 --> 50:54.521
Slap on the cuffs.

50:56.148 --> 50:59.296
Are you gonna tell my Ruth
and little Sammie what I am?

51:00.188 --> 51:02.864
Or do you want them to
 read about it in the papers?

51:04.072 --> 51:06.538
Or find out that daddy's a crook...

51:06.696 --> 51:09.127
from the kids in the playground.

51:13.519 --> 51:16.371
You'll ruin their lives.

51:19.292 --> 51:20.481
<i>He moved.</i>

51:26.023 --> 51:29.136
How badly do you want this,
DI Tyler?

51:30.308 --> 51:32.670
I just want you to stay.

51:34.584 --> 51:36.000
Can't stay.

51:37.750 --> 51:40.041
Not with Ruth and little Sam.

51:41.458 --> 51:43.267
If I stay, it's in prison.

51:49.687 --> 51:51.733
Oh my god!

51:53.990 --> 51:55.512
How can I...

51:57.138 --> 51:59.168
This is not fair!

51:59.325 --> 52:01.494
I can't win!

52:07.019 --> 52:08.978
What're you gonna do, Sam?

52:20.228 --> 52:21.312
Go.

52:26.466 --> 52:28.215
Get out of here.

53:09.449 --> 53:10.866
What's going on?

53:11.356 --> 53:12.755
Where's my Vic?

53:14.680 --> 53:15.957
Tell me.

53:19.420 --> 53:21.624
Vic was...

53:23.198 --> 53:25.437
involved in something.

53:28.323 --> 53:29.898
It wasn't his fault.

53:31.979 --> 53:34.708
He was in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

53:35.495 --> 53:39.046
His life,
and in fact, your lives...

53:39.238 --> 53:41.355
were all in danger.

53:43.629 --> 53:45.501
He's gone away now...

53:46.375 --> 53:49.944
so he can stay safe.

53:51.081 --> 53:54.072
You and Sammie will be safe.

53:56.906 --> 53:58.323
I'm sorry.

54:02.801 --> 54:05.023
I have to tell Sammie something.

54:07.157 --> 54:09.186
What do I tell him, Inspector?

54:12.929 --> 54:14.573
Tell him...

54:16.847 --> 54:18.439
He's on the road.

54:18.632 --> 54:20.661
Just back on the road.

54:23.267 --> 54:24.789
And tell him...

54:27.221 --> 54:29.460
He'll see his daddy again.

54:47.940 --> 54:49.637
Don't you look smart?

54:49.759 --> 54:51.351
Like a prince.

54:53.871 --> 54:56.180
Daddy's gone away, Sammie.

54:56.402 --> 54:59.792
He didn't want to, but...
he had to.

55:00.010 --> 55:02.328
On the road again, just...

55:02.831 --> 55:04.842
Just back on the road.

55:06.067 --> 55:08.035
<i>But he loves us.</i>

55:08.385 --> 55:10.178
<i>And you'll see him again.</i>

55:11.083 --> 55:14.109
Come on. Big man now.

55:14.336 --> 55:15.560
No tears.

55:17.152 --> 55:19.688
Hide those bad feelings away, Sam.

55:54.974 --> 55:56.689
Do you see now?

55:57.493 --> 55:59.837
Nothing can make you wake up...

56:00.152 --> 56:02.758
because you are already awake.

56:05.942 --> 56:08.688
I'm afraid I'm never
gonna believe that.

56:10.664 --> 56:12.326
But you should know...

56:18.813 --> 56:22.801
I don't hate everything
about this place.

56:31.381 --> 56:35.159
5'9, 5'10,
brown hair, collar length,

56:35.212 --> 56:38.763
last seen heading towards
the Brackley Green area on foot.

56:38.850 --> 56:40.949
Eyes and ears open from plod.

56:41.991 --> 56:45.402
You know what you've done, boss?
Lost me a fiver.

56:45.542 --> 56:47.781
We had a little bet,
not long after you arrived

56:47.851 --> 56:49.531
on who'd pull a gun on who first.

56:49.601 --> 56:51.595
I was sure it would be the guv.

56:52.173 --> 56:54.412
You shouldn't
underestimate me, Chris.

56:54.534 --> 56:56.371
I don't underestimate you, boss.

56:56.581 --> 56:58.470
I just don't understand you.

57:01.553 --> 57:03.775
I want to go home.

57:05.034 --> 57:07.361
Don't be such a jessy.

57:08.185 --> 57:09.724
Go home later.

57:14.115 --> 57:16.477
So. What do you wanna
do now then, guv?

57:19.713 --> 57:20.640
Pub!

57:22.442 --> 57:23.387
Pub.

57:31.914 --> 57:32.911
Pub.

57:52.124 --> 57:54.870
