WEBVTT

01:38.055 --> 01:41.767
- How we doing for time?
- Bullock's meeting us at 2300 hours.

01:42.059 --> 01:44.270
We'll be there
with time to spare. Relax.

01:51.861 --> 01:54.697
Sorry. I've never worked a sting before.

01:55.031 --> 01:56.741
It ought to be a hot one.

02:02.663 --> 02:04.707
Hot is right. What happened?

02:10.713 --> 02:12.089
Where's Bullock?

02:12.632 --> 02:16.052
I don't know, but we're in deep trouble.

02:16.344 --> 02:17.762
We've got to find Bullock.

02:24.977 --> 02:28.522
- Detective Bullock. Are you all right?
- I'm okay.

02:28.814 --> 02:32.234
Do you realize what this means?
Why didn't you wait for us?

02:44.538 --> 02:47.875
- Let's go.
- Wait. More inside.

02:47.958 --> 02:49.794
Wilkes, go after those two.

02:50.294 --> 02:51.671
I'll check out the warehouse.

03:03.140 --> 03:04.517
Batman!

03:09.021 --> 03:12.692
When I'm done with you clowns,
you won't qualify as security guards!

03:12.983 --> 03:15.569
The department works months
to nail that drug lord.

03:15.820 --> 03:18.406
We lay out $2 million in cash
for the sting.

03:18.489 --> 03:21.534
And in five stinking minutes,
you idiots blow it!

03:22.118 --> 03:25.079
- Hey, I didn't blow anything.
- Well, one of you did!

03:27.498 --> 03:30.459
Or maybe what we've got here
is three cops on the take.

03:30.543 --> 03:34.255
- That's uncalled for.
- What? You can't be serious.

03:34.338 --> 03:37.258
Where does he get off?
Hey, I'll tell you who's to blame.

03:37.341 --> 03:38.384
Batman!

03:39.385 --> 03:43.347
- You saw the Batman, too?
- Come on, Harvey, Batman's fault?

03:43.431 --> 03:45.766
Then whose fault is it, Officer?

03:45.850 --> 03:48.936
I don't know, but I'm sure
it wasn't Batman. He was--

03:49.019 --> 03:52.898
Either you start coming up with
some answers or hand over your badges.

03:53.065 --> 03:55.651
I'm telling you, Lieutenant,
Batman blew the bust.

03:55.735 --> 03:58.487
Montoya and Wilkes were late,
so I had to go in alone.

04:00.030 --> 04:01.323
We weren't late!

04:01.574 --> 04:05.161
You had your chance.
All right, Bullock, let's have it.

04:05.786 --> 04:08.122
Like I said, I had to go in alone.

04:10.040 --> 04:13.794
<i>I was waiting for Wilkes and Montoya
when I saw that blasted Batman</i>

04:13.878 --> 04:15.045
<i>enter the warehouse.</i>

04:15.379 --> 04:17.339
<i>I couldn't wait for backup any longer.</i>

04:17.590 --> 04:20.342
<i>I was afraid he'd screw up the bust,
so I followed him.</i>

04:54.293 --> 04:55.294
Got it.

04:59.757 --> 05:02.718
The boss was right.
Must be a couple of mil in here.

05:09.350 --> 05:12.770
<i>[was closing in
when this loud noise tipped them.</i>

05:15.731 --> 05:17.274
<i>Must have been Batman.</i>

05:17.566 --> 05:18.818
What was that?

05:33.499 --> 05:36.669
Freeze, maggots!
You're all under arrest!

05:37.127 --> 05:40.339
- Jeez!
- Over there. Get him!

06:48.699 --> 06:50.326
Fry, copper!

07:17.811 --> 07:20.648
<i>In spite of the fire,
I had everything under control</i>

07:20.898 --> 07:23.484
<i>and then Batman showed up
and bungled everything.</i>

07:36.830 --> 07:40.459
<i>Lucky I was there to save his butt.</i>

07:45.464 --> 07:48.092
It took my last bit of strength
to get us out.

07:48.509 --> 07:51.887
- So you went in because of Batman.
- I told you. They were late.

07:52.179 --> 07:55.891
Were you trying to beat them out
of the collar or beat them to the cash?

07:56.100 --> 07:59.645
- Ease up, Lieutenant.
- No. You back off, Commissioner!

07:59.812 --> 08:03.607
Gordon, this is my investigation,
so pipe down or get out!

08:03.691 --> 08:05.985
He knows they were
supposed to go in as a team.

08:06.235 --> 08:09.363
Bullock, I demand to know
the real reason you didn't wait

08:09.446 --> 08:10.614
for the rest of your team.

08:11.156 --> 08:13.075
- Bullock!
- Give me a break.

08:13.617 --> 08:15.202
Why don't you ask them
why they were late?

08:15.577 --> 08:17.287
But we weren't late, Detective.

08:17.371 --> 08:20.165
All right, let's hear from the rookie.

08:20.708 --> 08:23.585
Maybe he knows who's to blame
for this screw-up.

08:25.879 --> 08:31.135
Well, like Officer Montoya said,
we weren't late.

08:31.510 --> 08:33.846
When we arrived,
Detective Bullock was down.

08:34.096 --> 08:36.473
Then the two suspects
came out of the building.

08:36.724 --> 08:39.893
<i>I pursued them while Officer Montoya
went into the warehouse.</i>

08:41.937 --> 08:43.647
<i>When I looked into the alley...</i>

08:44.690 --> 08:47.109
<i>The suspects completely vanished.</i>

09:08.672 --> 09:10.299
<i>I thought I'd bought it.</i>

09:12.926 --> 09:15.137
<i>Then he came flying out of nowhere.</i>

09:15.262 --> 09:18.057
<i>I'd heard of him,
but I'd never seen him before.</i>

09:18.891 --> 09:21.477
<i>It was incredible,
the Batman threw out his hand</i>

09:21.560 --> 09:23.979
<i>and sparks flew from his fingertips.</i>

09:33.989 --> 09:35.365
<i>Then he pointed his fingers...</i>

09:38.494 --> 09:41.205
<i>And some kind of ray
shot out at the van.</i>

09:43.082 --> 09:44.416
<i>It blew the door open.</i>

09:44.875 --> 09:46.502
<i>One of the suspects staggered out.</i>

09:46.794 --> 09:48.921
<i>The other must've escaped
through the loading dock.</i>

09:51.173 --> 09:53.884
<i>The guy tried to bolt
and the Batman just pointed at him.</i>

09:54.468 --> 09:55.761
<i>Wham! He dropped!</i>

09:56.553 --> 09:59.848
<i>It was unbelievable!
Batman's on the guy in a flash.</i>

10:00.265 --> 10:02.101
<i>Then the Batman says something to him.</i>

10:04.812 --> 10:06.480
What did he say?

10:07.773 --> 10:11.151
I couldn't hear.
But the guy looked plenty scared

10:11.235 --> 10:15.280
-and blurted out "Doc" something.
- Doc who?

10:15.614 --> 10:18.909
I don't know. He just said "Doc."

10:19.827 --> 10:23.789
We're interrogating the suspect now,
but it doesn't look like he'll crack.

10:24.414 --> 10:26.458
Well, I think the rookie's
holding something back.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.128
Take it easy!
He told you everything he knows!

10:29.670 --> 10:33.549
How touching. I hope you're as good
at defending yourself

10:33.966 --> 10:36.677
since the detective here
is calling you a liar.

10:36.927 --> 10:39.888
Wait a minute.
Nobody's calling anyone a liar.

10:40.264 --> 10:42.933
There's obviously a
communication problem here.

10:43.183 --> 10:48.313
- But my officers are not liars.
- Well, someone in here is lying.

10:48.856 --> 10:50.899
Why don't you reserve judgment
until you've heard

10:50.983 --> 10:52.818
what Officer Montoya has to say.

10:53.193 --> 10:55.154
All right, let's have your version.

10:56.196 --> 10:58.949
Like I said before,
we got there on time.

10:59.408 --> 11:00.659
Bullock was down.

11:01.910 --> 11:04.496
<i>He said there were still
suspects inside, so I entered.</i>

11:13.672 --> 11:15.299
We'll take it down
to Hathcock.

11:15.591 --> 11:17.801
<i>And then I heard the name "Hathcock."</i>

11:19.553 --> 11:21.430
Freeze! Police!

11:41.283 --> 11:42.367
Get her.

11:43.785 --> 11:45.204
My pleasure.

11:57.132 --> 11:59.426
<i>I guess Batman must have
gotten a second wind</i>

11:59.509 --> 12:01.970
<i>after Detective Bullock dragged him out.</i>

12:03.764 --> 12:05.557
<i>Because he was in rare form.</i>

12:09.811 --> 12:10.812
Behind you!

12:21.615 --> 12:25.285
<i>I was just about to cuff them when
the whole place started to come down.</i>

12:26.119 --> 12:28.747
<i>Before I knew what happened,
Batman pushed me out of the way.</i>

12:34.586 --> 12:36.630
<i>He was buried alive.</i>

12:44.638 --> 12:47.849
- There was nothing I could do.
- Poor Batman.

12:48.141 --> 12:51.353
But don't feel too bad.
One of you is going to burn, too.

12:51.436 --> 12:54.898
What we've got here is three cops
with two stories.

12:55.190 --> 12:58.610
- I'm telling you, they were late!
- Commissioner, it's just not true.

12:58.694 --> 13:00.112
Bullock went in early.

13:00.195 --> 13:03.407
So you're accusing the detective
of trying to hog the collar?

13:03.699 --> 13:05.867
He may have had good reason
for going in.

13:06.076 --> 13:07.536
But we were not late.

13:07.869 --> 13:09.579
So it's my word against theirs.

13:10.372 --> 13:11.957
Now what, Commissioner?

13:12.040 --> 13:15.210
You're all suspended
until I make my decision.

13:15.294 --> 13:17.629
- Suspended?
- Hey, you can't--

13:17.879 --> 13:19.006
But no, I--

13:19.214 --> 13:21.758
I'll take your badges and your weapons.

13:36.565 --> 13:38.108
You too, Officer.

14:04.426 --> 14:05.886
Doc. Doc.

14:07.429 --> 14:08.889
Dr. Hathcock. Dock!

14:16.480 --> 14:18.857
Dock. Gotham Harbor! The dock!

14:19.316 --> 14:20.400
I'd better tell--

14:20.984 --> 14:22.069
No-

14:47.803 --> 14:49.513
Hathcock. Yes!

14:51.098 --> 14:52.933
Now it all comes together.

15:34.808 --> 15:37.686
I wonder what the boss is gonna do
with pointy-ears up there.

15:37.978 --> 15:40.063
Well, he's already been charbroiled.

15:40.147 --> 15:42.065
How about we skewer him?

15:42.149 --> 15:45.777
No. The boss figures
he's worth more in one piece.

15:46.069 --> 15:47.446
Where is your boss?

15:47.529 --> 15:49.906
Is he gonna keep me
hanging around all day?

15:52.075 --> 15:54.870
Keep your cape on. He's right up there.

15:56.288 --> 15:58.957
That's all I wanted to know.

16:48.006 --> 16:50.509
- I thought you were--
- Not while there's unfinished business.

16:59.809 --> 17:01.019
Come on.

17:51.278 --> 17:53.446
Argh! Give me another clip.

17:59.411 --> 18:00.662
Oh, boy!

18:03.248 --> 18:04.541
Are you all right?

18:07.127 --> 18:09.963
- Dandy.
- Then don't go away.

18:10.547 --> 18:11.590
Count on it.

18:56.009 --> 18:57.093
What?

20:58.840 --> 21:00.717
I have to hand it to you, Montoya.

21:01.176 --> 21:03.511
You and the Batman
really turned this thing around.

21:03.762 --> 21:07.056
Yeah. What a collar.
You didn't just bust them,

21:07.140 --> 21:08.975
you put the whole gang
out of commission.

21:09.058 --> 21:11.394
What collar? She's suspended!

21:11.686 --> 21:13.897
This farce has gone far enough, Hackle.

21:14.397 --> 21:16.733
We've nailed the suspects
and recovered our money.

21:16.983 --> 21:18.568
The investigation is closed.

21:19.402 --> 21:21.654
Officer Montoya earned this collar.

21:22.864 --> 21:26.993
The collar belongs to all three of us.
It was a team effort.

21:28.203 --> 21:30.455
Gee, thanks, partner.

21:32.624 --> 21:33.875
What was that, Bullock?

21:36.044 --> 21:37.253
I said...

21:38.546 --> 21:40.131
Thanks a lot, Montoya.

22:18.878 --> 22:19.879
English - SDH
