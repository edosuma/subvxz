WEBVTT

00:09.843 --> 00:12.011
Charter City is stunned
by the sudden roll-out

00:12.095 --> 00:15.348
of Rook Unlimited's
most fantastic device ever...

00:16.224 --> 00:17.434
[chirrups]

00:17.517 --> 00:18.852
...the SmartMark.

00:18.935 --> 00:20.437
Throw your other devices away,

00:20.520 --> 00:23.189
because the SmartMark
is more than just a phone,

00:23.273 --> 00:24.858
it's part of you.

00:25.191 --> 00:27.861
-Use it as cash.
-[chirrups and beeps]

00:27.944 --> 00:29.195
Book your travel.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.948
And even shoot video.

00:34.242 --> 00:36.911
Distribution points are all over the city.

00:37.454 --> 00:39.205
And don't let the lines discourage you.

00:39.289 --> 00:42.292
The Rook Unlimited SmartMark
is worth the wait.

00:44.794 --> 00:48.423
I never realized how wonderful technology
could make me feel.

00:48.506 --> 00:51.259
The SmartMark has brought
order to my life.

00:51.342 --> 00:54.721
And the best part? It's absolutely free!

00:54.804 --> 00:58.641
A gift of thanks to our city
from Rook Unlimited!

00:58.725 --> 00:59.726
[crowd cheers]

01:02.228 --> 01:05.940
Twenty-three percent of the population
has been given the SmartMark, Number One.

01:06.024 --> 01:07.942
Time to test our system, Number Six.

01:08.026 --> 01:11.821
The Flex Fighters are out there somewhere,
teaming up with Jonathan Rook.

01:11.905 --> 01:15.116
Let's put our new recruits to work.
Subtly.

01:17.243 --> 01:18.244
[chirrups]

01:22.165 --> 01:23.541
[electronic chirruping]

01:23.625 --> 01:25.668
We should find the Flex Fighters.

01:30.340 --> 01:33.760
-[chirrups]
-I ought to find the Flex Fighters.

01:33.843 --> 01:36.304
[all] We should find the Flex Fighters.

01:36.387 --> 01:38.473
[man 1] We should find the Flex Fighters.

01:38.556 --> 01:40.809
[man 2] We should find the Flex Fighters.

01:40.892 --> 01:42.352
The most dangerous people on Earth

01:42.435 --> 01:45.313
are those who are under control of others,
but don't realize it.

01:45.855 --> 01:48.983
This is bad in every conceivable way.

01:53.154 --> 01:54.656

02:31.234 --> 02:32.861
I gotta find the Flex Fighters.

02:40.160 --> 02:43.163
So every single SmartMark user
is now a Tech-Men-controlled,

02:43.246 --> 02:44.581
Flex Fighter-hunting zombie?

02:45.081 --> 02:46.875
Party for you. You love zombies.

02:47.041 --> 02:52.130
In movies, dude. And TV. And video games.
And sometimes my dreams.

02:52.213 --> 02:53.548
But not in my neighborhood.

02:53.756 --> 02:56.050
Don't worry.
I already have a plan for us to employ.

02:56.217 --> 02:59.137
"Us"? We tried "us." It started fine.

02:59.220 --> 03:01.222
Then you poisoned our snow cones, man.

03:01.598 --> 03:03.224
Snow cones! Not cool!

03:03.516 --> 03:05.476
The Tech-Men's SmartMark
is based on research

03:05.560 --> 03:08.146
I submitted to the Epsilon Society
when I was a kid.

03:08.438 --> 03:10.189
I alone know how to shut it down.

03:10.732 --> 03:12.901
Whatever, Mr. Ego-Face.

03:12.984 --> 03:15.403
Dr. C could probably build
an Anti-SmartMark doodad

03:15.486 --> 03:17.280
out of two wires and a can of beans.

03:17.530 --> 03:21.284
Wrong. I jam the transmitter,
the Tech-Men will just deploy another.

03:21.659 --> 03:22.535
Exactly.

03:22.619 --> 03:27.206
But a device I've designed can disable
all the SmartMark units permanently.

03:27.498 --> 03:28.541
And this device is where?

03:28.750 --> 03:31.252
It doesn't exist yet.
I'll need access to your lab.

03:31.336 --> 03:34.380
Once I build this thing, the Flex Fighters
will have to get me past the Tech-Men

03:34.464 --> 03:36.049
into Rook Tower to activate it.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.760
Yeah, too bad we don't work
for you anymore.

03:38.843 --> 03:41.888
I'm pretty sure you fired us
when you were firing at us.

03:41.971 --> 03:45.642
There's no way we should team up
with this madman, right, Dr. C?

03:45.725 --> 03:50.647
Rook is, unfortunately, our best chance
to stop Kane and the Tech-Men.

03:50.730 --> 03:51.856
[loud clunk]

03:51.940 --> 03:53.816
Blindstrike! Stand down!

03:53.900 --> 03:56.945
You think I don't know what I'm asking
you to do, after the people he's hurt.

03:57.028 --> 04:00.198
This will not be easy for me either.
But this city needs to be saved.

04:00.365 --> 04:03.660
So we choke back our feelings,
we sacrifice our personal needs.

04:03.743 --> 04:05.161
We do what it takes!

04:05.245 --> 04:07.580
Do you understand?

04:08.873 --> 04:11.209
-Any more objections?
-What? No.

04:11.292 --> 04:13.253
-Great idea.
-Let's do your plan.

04:13.795 --> 04:15.755
I knew you'd all see the light.
Now first we--

04:15.838 --> 04:18.675
First, we get something from you.

04:21.344 --> 04:25.515
<i>I am Jonathan Rook. But I'm also</i>
<i>the creature known as Stretch Monster.</i>

04:25.932 --> 04:29.352
I'm the one who brought down
Dr. Cleo's plane over the Pearl Islands.

04:29.435 --> 04:30.979
She was the only survivor.

04:31.062 --> 04:34.649
My illegal experiments created
Smokestack, Circuit-Stream,

04:34.732 --> 04:37.360
and the other super-powered villains
that swept through Charter City.

04:37.443 --> 04:40.947
And, yes,
I framed the Flex Fighters for my crimes.

04:41.030 --> 04:44.784
In reality, they were always the heroes
the city believed them to be.

04:45.451 --> 04:48.037
You understand,
once we help you stop the Tech-Men,

04:48.121 --> 04:50.290
we'll release this confession
to the media?

04:52.709 --> 04:55.503
I care about this city
more than I care about myself.

04:57.547 --> 04:59.465
-[muscles creak]
-[groans]

05:01.551 --> 05:02.719
Thank you.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.804
What do you need to build this device?

05:05.054 --> 05:06.639
Three hours. And your help.

05:06.973 --> 05:08.975
Fine. But you're wearing this.

05:09.183 --> 05:11.978
A control collar? Really? Let me guess.

05:12.061 --> 05:15.231
Don't step out of line,
or it will cause me immeasurable pain?

05:15.315 --> 05:19.652
No, do step out of line.
Blindstrike's been dying to try it.

05:20.862 --> 05:23.239
Three hours is enough time
for us get to our families.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.575
Maybe we can stop them
before they get marked.

05:35.835 --> 05:38.171
Dad! I'm so glad you're here.

05:38.254 --> 05:41.257
Hello, son. I was checking
traffic cameras around town,

05:41.340 --> 05:44.260
trying to spot the Flex Fighters.
I should have been doing this for months.

05:46.095 --> 05:47.096
My SmartMark.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.849
Rook Unlimited Employees were the first
to get them installed.

05:50.058 --> 05:51.684
And they gave me one
to bring home for you.

05:52.101 --> 05:54.437
-Pays to know people, huh?
-No. I'm good

05:54.771 --> 05:57.940
You need one if you're going to compete
in today's world. Give me your arm.

06:02.111 --> 06:04.447
Grandpa, Mr. Savic, where is everybody?

06:05.323 --> 06:08.117
Ah, they all went to get
those foolish new devices.

06:08.284 --> 06:11.204
What? No, they can't!
Grandpa, those things are dangerous!

06:11.287 --> 06:13.206
It's a conspiracy! Mind control!

06:13.289 --> 06:15.291
Ha! I knew it!

06:16.167 --> 06:19.378
I was two moves away
from closing my Albin Counter-Gambit!

06:19.587 --> 06:23.174
Are you listening, Oleg?
Rook is making a move on the city.

06:23.257 --> 06:27.386
Besides, I would have shut you down
with a symmetrical defense.

06:27.678 --> 06:30.515
Symmetrical defense? Hardly.

06:30.598 --> 06:33.392
Come on, come on.
Mom, don't get the Smart--

06:34.519 --> 06:38.856
Yeah, the reception's great. Okay. Okay.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.233
She had to hang up,

06:40.525 --> 06:42.819
so they could all go look
for the Flex Fighters.

06:43.027 --> 06:45.113
Isabelle too? Even she has one?

06:52.495 --> 06:53.704
Erika? Oh.

06:55.748 --> 06:56.999
[labored breaths]

06:57.250 --> 07:00.128
She's just not herself today, poor thing.

07:00.211 --> 07:01.045
She needs help.

07:01.337 --> 07:04.841
You are right, a SmartMark.
That'll make her feel better.

07:04.924 --> 07:09.011
I'll have our Rook Unlimited rep
arrange an in-home installation.

07:10.805 --> 07:11.806
[groans]

07:12.682 --> 07:13.683
[electrical crackle]

07:24.026 --> 07:25.278
That's not the right interface.

07:25.570 --> 07:28.948
It's an update I developed.
The Rook Unlimited model was too slow.

07:31.075 --> 07:33.202
Nice. Just like old times.

07:33.411 --> 07:37.331
The good old days.
Before you tried to kill me three times.

07:40.668 --> 07:43.463
You know, we came up
with some amazing innovations together.

07:43.546 --> 07:46.340
You have to admit.
We both produced better work as a team.

07:50.428 --> 07:55.391
-Epsilon Society. I know the name.
-Keep searching.

07:55.475 --> 07:58.227
Any information we can find
might be able to help.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.312
[door opens]

08:00.021 --> 08:02.815
My dad's one of them now.
A SmartMark zombie.

08:02.899 --> 08:03.941
I just barely got away.

08:04.233 --> 08:07.570
Same with my family. I hope
Riya was able to warn Erika in time.

08:07.653 --> 08:09.197
We should get back.

08:19.624 --> 08:23.920
Gather the troops.
We've found the Flex Fighters.

08:28.049 --> 08:29.926
We can't wait for Blindstrike any longer.

08:30.009 --> 08:33.471
We need to install the device directly
at the signal's source in Rook Tower.

08:33.554 --> 08:36.224
Sure. We'll just ask
the Tech-Men to give us a tour.

08:36.307 --> 08:38.559
Kane will be all, step right in.

08:39.018 --> 08:41.729
Rook can get us inside.
He knows where the tunnels are.

08:42.188 --> 08:43.481
Tunnels? What?

08:45.566 --> 08:47.818
Okay, yes, How did you know?

08:48.361 --> 08:51.072
You had to be going in and out somehow
as Stretch Monster.

08:51.155 --> 08:54.200
Security probably would've noticed
an elastic beast in the lobby,

08:54.283 --> 08:55.660
So lead the way.

08:55.743 --> 08:56.744
[loud grunts]

08:57.787 --> 08:58.663
They found us.

09:04.835 --> 09:06.796
Rook, this ends now.

09:06.879 --> 09:11.342
Submit to our SmartMark and join
the glorious victory of order over chaos,

09:11.425 --> 09:12.843
or you will be eliminated.

09:16.764 --> 09:17.598
Order's overrated.

09:17.848 --> 09:21.894
You call yourself a man of science?
World Order is our destiny.

09:21.978 --> 09:24.355
For all your brilliance,
you understand nothing.

09:24.897 --> 09:27.149
Yes, I am brilliant.
Wanna know how that works?

09:27.233 --> 09:29.610
You study, work, and experiment.

09:29.694 --> 09:32.488
Then, once you've got
all that knowledge rolling around,

09:32.572 --> 09:36.993
two ideas that don't belong together
suddenly crash into one another, and bam!

09:37.076 --> 09:39.495
A world-changing innovation hits you!

09:39.579 --> 09:43.291
See? Brilliance only happens
with a healthy dose of chaos.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.043
No. Progress is born by orderly minds.

09:46.544 --> 09:50.423
Orderly minds are too focused
to be creative. Look at you.

09:50.506 --> 09:53.301
So focused on me,
you let the Flex Fighters sneak around

09:53.384 --> 09:54.552
-right behind you.
-What?

10:00.474 --> 10:01.309
Hey there!

10:01.976 --> 10:03.060
[groans]

10:03.144 --> 10:05.980
See? A little chaos can be fun.

10:06.063 --> 10:07.064
[grunts]

10:14.572 --> 10:17.992
Flex Fighters! No more. Shut this down.

10:18.492 --> 10:19.994
You were never any fun, Kane!

10:21.203 --> 10:22.204
[grunts] Whoa!

10:24.582 --> 10:27.376
You think you can beat me? I trained you!

10:27.460 --> 10:30.504
I know every move you're gonna make
before you even think of it!

10:31.464 --> 10:34.008
But there was always something
you could never see coming.

10:34.258 --> 10:35.593
What are you talking about?

10:36.135 --> 10:37.178
A blind strike.

10:37.970 --> 10:39.055

10:48.105 --> 10:50.066
-[cock guns]
-[grunts]

10:53.110 --> 10:56.989
Blindstrike really is amazing. You know,
I am looking for a new head of security.

10:57.073 --> 10:59.283
Yeah. Keep looking.

11:05.748 --> 11:06.832
[men grunt]

11:18.052 --> 11:19.178
[cock guns]

11:21.013 --> 11:23.307
You're strong.
But there are too many of us.

11:23.599 --> 11:26.727
One thing I should have taught you.
When to give up.

11:28.646 --> 11:31.816
I've triggered the self-destruct.
Everyone, run!

11:39.323 --> 11:40.324
[loud boom]

11:48.666 --> 11:53.337
Tech-Men, advance! The Flex Fighters
are all that stand in our way.

11:53.421 --> 11:54.964
We must eliminate them!

12:00.886 --> 12:03.139
Spread out! Don't let them get away!

12:08.811 --> 12:09.937
[electronic beeps]

12:11.480 --> 12:13.858
Erika! What happened to her?

12:14.275 --> 12:17.570
I know these symptoms.
A variant Flexarium-isotope poisoning.

12:17.653 --> 12:19.780
-If she's not treated soon--
-I can help her.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.657
But we have to get her
to one of my safe houses.

12:22.950 --> 12:26.412
I'll take Erika. The rest of you,
keep going. Keep an eye on Rook.

12:26.996 --> 12:29.373
It's up to all of you
to stop the Tech-Men now.

12:31.167 --> 12:33.586
Let's go. We only get one shot.

12:44.763 --> 12:46.557
I can't hold my breath much longer!

12:46.640 --> 12:50.686
You're not holding your breath,
you're talking. Now shush!

12:54.523 --> 12:55.900
[both exhale]

12:57.693 --> 13:01.947
These fascist dudes are everywhere,
like ogres in a 5th-level dungeon.

13:02.114 --> 13:05.993
Truth. But there's gotta be one
un-guarded exit in this joint.

13:06.076 --> 13:10.206
If somebody had read my proposal
for invisibility suit research,

13:10.289 --> 13:12.374
maybe we'd be transparent right now.

13:12.541 --> 13:16.378
Well, it's hard to read proposals
that are covered in wing sauce, dorkis.

13:16.462 --> 13:17.546
Let's move.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.173
[grunts] Ooh, ooh.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.300
I'm stuck! I'm stuck! Give me a tug!

13:22.510 --> 13:27.014
I spend far too much of my career
pulling you out of ducting.

13:27.097 --> 13:30.017
Three PhDs for this jazz?

13:31.393 --> 13:35.314
You were stuck because you stuffed
your pockets with game dice?!

13:35.606 --> 13:38.025
I'm not gonna leave behind
my sweet dice hoard.

13:38.108 --> 13:40.986
Hello! "Tech-Men"? Obviously nerds.

13:41.070 --> 13:43.989
Which means
they'd totally have stolen my D20s!

13:44.073 --> 13:46.992
And what are you gonna do if they attack?
Make a saving throw?

13:47.368 --> 13:49.078
Maybe. Shut up.

13:51.205 --> 13:53.374
The Flex Fighters
couldn't have just disappeared.

13:53.541 --> 13:55.876
Time to go to the next level
on the SmartMarks.

13:56.043 --> 13:58.712
Moving from search mode
to attack mode, Number One.

13:59.046 --> 14:02.174
It would be so great
to find the Flex Fighters. To...

14:03.801 --> 14:06.637
...to destroy the Flex Fighters!

14:07.638 --> 14:11.767
They built the new Academy library
right over the top of the old one,

14:11.850 --> 14:13.894
still filled with its written records.

14:13.978 --> 14:17.856
I'll bet answers
to the Epsilon Society are here.

14:19.191 --> 14:20.192
Ha!

14:20.484 --> 14:24.530
A locked door means nothing
to a good reporter.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.490
[grunts] Ah-ah-ah!

14:26.574 --> 14:27.575
[bleeps]

14:28.534 --> 14:30.703
I teach here, remember?

14:33.831 --> 14:34.957
This one's sealed, too.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.709
Kane must have hunted out my tunnels.

14:36.959 --> 14:39.962
The fastest way into Rook Tower
would be from the surface.

14:48.053 --> 14:49.847
The coast seems clear.

14:53.893 --> 14:57.354
Over there. We found them. Destroy them.

14:58.480 --> 14:59.481
[low growl]

15:00.357 --> 15:01.317
No!

15:03.611 --> 15:06.363
They're innocents controlled by Kane.
We can't hurt them.

15:06.739 --> 15:09.408
So the plan is, what?
Let them take us down?

15:09.491 --> 15:10.534
[clamoring]

15:10.618 --> 15:13.746
Destroy the Flex Fighters! Get them!

15:16.624 --> 15:21.879
Destroy the Flex Fighters!
Destroy the Flex Fighters!

15:22.129 --> 15:23.881
Everyone! Back here!

15:32.306 --> 15:34.642
Would do you please just, move!

15:34.725 --> 15:37.436
-Brick and Mortar?
-Thanks for coming to help, guys!

15:37.519 --> 15:40.230
Yeah! Help. Obvs.

15:40.314 --> 15:43.943
We weren't just looking for a way
to escape. At all.

15:44.026 --> 15:45.027
Take off!

15:45.110 --> 15:46.153
-Ow!
-[clamoring]

15:55.955 --> 15:58.374
Number One, they're inside Rook Tower.

15:58.457 --> 16:01.794
Get us there.
We're entering the final phase.

16:04.546 --> 16:07.216
You guys love new tech.
You didn't want to get SmartMarked?

16:08.008 --> 16:10.511
No way. That's clearly some shady biz.

16:10.594 --> 16:13.389
Who wants to be content all the time?
It's creepy.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.057
Can you get us to Rook's office?

16:15.391 --> 16:18.560
Sure. By now we know these vents
like the backs of our hands.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.104
Well, the front of our hands.

16:20.187 --> 16:23.482
I made a map of the whole network
on my palm, see?

16:24.817 --> 16:28.153
Guess I got a little sweaty.
But it's a left up ahead.

16:28.612 --> 16:32.032
-Or a right.
-Which means it's probably straight.

16:40.290 --> 16:42.668
We need to pull the Tech-Men's attention
away from here.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.837
We're great at attracting attention.

16:44.920 --> 16:47.339
That's probably the number one thing
about us.

16:50.384 --> 16:55.055
Birth certificates, corporate records.
This is a jumbled mess.

16:55.139 --> 16:57.266
Nothing on the Epsilon Society.

16:57.516 --> 17:00.227
I think someone's been here recently.

17:00.310 --> 17:03.355
Maybe we aren't the only ones
searching the library?

17:03.897 --> 17:06.859
Oleg! I think I've got it.

17:11.321 --> 17:13.991
-[laser blast]
-What was that?

17:16.285 --> 17:17.286
[grunts]

17:19.955 --> 17:21.290
[laser blast]

17:23.876 --> 17:25.210
Sorry not sorry.

17:33.844 --> 17:35.971
They really are good
at attracting attention.

17:41.685 --> 17:42.686
[computer chirrups]

17:45.981 --> 17:46.982
[men laugh]

17:50.611 --> 17:51.695
[both gasp]

17:54.656 --> 17:56.450
The EMP Blaster!

18:00.704 --> 18:04.291
Don't move.
These fools are just another distraction.

18:04.374 --> 18:07.169
You two deal with them.
The rest of you, with me.

18:15.135 --> 18:16.178
Saving throw!

18:16.261 --> 18:17.304
[clattering]

18:17.763 --> 18:19.223
[both grunt]

18:21.433 --> 18:25.979
-My sweet dice hoard...
-Life rule: "Never look back!"

18:29.441 --> 18:32.402
There. Now we just bring it online and--

18:34.863 --> 18:35.864
[cock guns]

18:38.450 --> 18:39.451
Hmph.

18:47.167 --> 18:49.753
Ha. Exactly what we needed.

18:49.962 --> 18:52.172
Right.
Like you were planning this all along.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.843
You were planning this all along!

18:56.260 --> 18:58.137
There was one missing component we needed

18:58.220 --> 19:00.430
that we weren't unable
to engineer on our own.

19:00.514 --> 19:03.100
And since you know the science
better than anyone,

19:03.308 --> 19:07.354
I knew you could and would create it,
given a need.

19:07.771 --> 19:10.899
What are you talking about?
That device couldn't-- Oh, no.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.192
Don't you "oh, no" right now!

19:12.818 --> 19:14.570
If I'm correct, you engineered this

19:14.653 --> 19:16.697
to manipulate
the SmartMark transmission waves,

19:17.072 --> 19:19.199
which is precisely
what us, Tech-Men, required

19:19.283 --> 19:21.201
to take our device to the next level.

19:21.285 --> 19:24.454
And put our real plan in motion.
Thank you.

19:24.538 --> 19:25.789
No!

19:28.125 --> 19:29.751
Still having fun?

19:30.627 --> 19:32.796
We've only gotten 28 percent
of the city population

19:32.880 --> 19:34.798
to install SmartMark so far.

19:35.132 --> 19:38.844
But your chip makes it possible
to control everyone in Charter City,

19:38.927 --> 19:41.054
whether they're marked or not.

19:41.221 --> 19:42.222
[chirrups]

19:44.016 --> 19:45.184
[beeps]

19:47.686 --> 19:48.687
[electromagnetic pulse]

20:01.158 --> 20:02.159
Hmm.

20:06.288 --> 20:09.917
I'm sorry for causing so much trouble.
I'm so much happier now.

20:10.459 --> 20:14.129
Seriously, why fight the Tech-Men
when we can obey them?

20:14.213 --> 20:16.506
Progress comes from an ordered mind.

20:16.965 --> 20:20.969
We now control the entire population
of Charter City.

20:23.347 --> 20:26.600
-What about them?
-They are nothing to worry about.

20:26.683 --> 20:29.228
There is no better prison
than mind control.

20:29.311 --> 20:30.938
See how content they are?

20:37.819 --> 20:38.862
Phew.

20:38.946 --> 20:40.697
Okay, I think they bought it.

20:41.615 --> 20:42.449
Bought what?

20:43.700 --> 20:47.287
Right. Very funny. Now come on. Guys?

20:49.039 --> 20:52.167
Keep your masks on! Stop!
The security cameras!

20:52.251 --> 20:53.252
[grunts]

21:07.266 --> 21:09.184
[all grunt]

21:10.018 --> 21:11.019
Huh?

21:15.399 --> 21:16.900
Have you gone crazy?

21:20.112 --> 21:23.240
You're Flex Fighters, remember?
You're heroes!

21:24.741 --> 21:28.328
They're brainwashed, then why am I not?
