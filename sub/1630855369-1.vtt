21:11.625 --> 21:13.083
-What?
-[woman] Jenna!

21:13.166 --> 21:14.041
[Jenna] Hi!

21:14.125 --> 21:16.250
Oh, Jenna, my love.

21:16.333 --> 21:18.916
-Darling.
-What happened?

21:19.000 --> 21:21.041
I was chasing Taraji P. Henson,

21:21.125 --> 21:24.083
and I slipped on my meditation marbles.

21:24.166 --> 21:26.666
Yeah, I'm… I'm sorry.
You were chasing Taraji?

21:26.750 --> 21:29.666
Yes. Taraji P. Henson.

21:30.333 --> 21:31.500
My peacock.

21:31.583 --> 21:33.916
She's one bad bitch,

21:34.500 --> 21:38.541
but sadly, she perished in the fall.

21:39.208 --> 21:41.208
-Right.
-Come on. Come. Come. This way.

21:41.291 --> 21:43.458
I have the perfect spot. [groans]

21:43.541 --> 21:44.708
[sobbing]

21:44.791 --> 21:45.625
Maybe…

21:47.083 --> 21:49.541
We'll do it here. Right here.

21:49.625 --> 21:54.833
Next to my poor, beautiful baby, Taraji.
[sobs]

21:54.916 --> 21:56.666
Oh, I miss you.

21:57.833 --> 22:00.583
Well, this is it.

22:01.875 --> 22:04.250
Let's… Let's get started, shall we?

22:05.000 --> 22:07.958
Can you tell us a little bit
about your design process?

22:08.041 --> 22:10.333
[sobs]

22:10.416 --> 22:12.125
I miss you.

22:12.208 --> 22:14.958
I'm so sorry!

22:17.791 --> 22:19.208
Okay, yeah. Um…

22:20.291 --> 22:21.625
Your new collection.

22:21.708 --> 22:25.250
-We'd love to hear about it.
-[sobs]

22:26.000 --> 22:30.333
Taraji!

22:33.000 --> 22:35.666
How was I supposed to know
her damn pet peacock died?

22:36.250 --> 22:37.500
I thought it would be epic.

22:37.583 --> 22:40.125
Oh, nah, it was epic. It was an epic fail.

22:41.666 --> 22:43.583
-Why didn't you stop me?
-Are you serious?

22:43.666 --> 22:44.500
Yeah.

22:45.333 --> 22:48.208
As if you consulted me at any point
during this entire process.

22:48.291 --> 22:50.166
This was your struggle idea. Own it.

22:50.250 --> 22:51.541
It's my fault, okay?

22:51.625 --> 22:53.208
It's all my fault.

22:53.291 --> 22:57.041
My whole life is riding on this job,
and I keep fucking it up.

22:58.416 --> 22:59.250
[sighs]

22:59.333 --> 23:03.625
Jenna, believe it or not,
I know what I'm doing, all right?

23:03.708 --> 23:07.708
Why won't you just let me
help you, collaborate? It'd be easier.

23:10.166 --> 23:11.000
Okay.

23:11.875 --> 23:12.875
[phone chimes]

23:17.875 --> 23:19.291
You can answer that.

23:20.291 --> 23:21.208
I'm good.

23:22.791 --> 23:24.000
Is that your girlfriend?

23:26.000 --> 23:29.208
Ex-girlfriend. Very recent ex.

23:29.291 --> 23:31.708
No. Oh my God.

23:31.791 --> 23:34.375
Tell me you didn't break up
because of what happened between us.

23:34.458 --> 23:36.833
Oh God, please.
I wouldn't be able to live with myself.

23:36.916 --> 23:41.208
-Oh my God. Are you kidding?
-Yo. Hey, someone let me out this cab.

23:41.291 --> 23:43.541
-What?
-No. I mean, if I caused harm…

23:43.625 --> 23:46.791
Like, I am not that girl.
I'm a girl's girl. Had I known…

23:46.875 --> 23:49.583
Yo, your ego is crazy.

23:49.666 --> 23:52.458
First of all, nothing happened between us.

23:52.541 --> 23:54.625
Well, nah, something happened.

23:54.708 --> 23:58.041
That was, like, level one.
That was mild. Come on, now.

23:58.125 --> 24:00.708
Mild! That was, at least, medium sauce.

24:00.791 --> 24:04.166
Second, she and I were already broken up,
so you're good.

24:04.250 --> 24:06.291
"Girl's girl." Oh my goodness.

24:08.166 --> 24:09.000
Oh.

24:09.666 --> 24:10.500
It's cool.

24:14.166 --> 24:16.375
What's her name?
What does she do? How old is she?

24:16.458 --> 24:17.291
[sighs]

24:18.208 --> 24:20.791
Her name is Madison.
She's a ballerina. She's 22.

24:20.875 --> 24:22.083
Of course she is.

24:22.750 --> 24:26.166
Yo, okay, what's up? What's the deal?
Like, you got a man? What's going on?

24:26.250 --> 24:28.541
I'm in between relationships.

24:28.625 --> 24:30.208
Mainly because men my age

24:31.375 --> 24:32.375
want women Madison's age.

24:32.458 --> 24:33.916
Mm. Mm.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.416
I don't know. Maybe they're not interested
in dating women who are complicated.

24:37.500 --> 24:39.333
-Oh.
-[Eric] Yeah.

24:39.416 --> 24:40.458
So Madison's simple.

24:40.541 --> 24:41.708
Madison is sweet.

24:41.791 --> 24:46.083
So that's why you broke up.
You got bored of your sweet, simple girl.

24:46.166 --> 24:48.125
-That's not what I said.
-That's what you meant.

24:48.208 --> 24:50.916
You know, this whole bitter
and jaded thing you got going on,

24:51.000 --> 24:52.375
it's a really bad look on you.

24:52.458 --> 24:55.708
It's like some bad energy happening
all right here. Yeah.

24:55.791 --> 24:57.958
Okay, got it. Got it.

24:59.541 --> 25:02.583
-You know, I can't… I can't stand you.
-[chuckles]

25:02.666 --> 25:05.666
-[Jenna] Oh my God!
-Yeah. The feeling is incredibly mutual.

25:05.750 --> 25:08.458
-Oh, you're gonna go?
-Yeah, I'm out.

25:08.541 --> 25:09.791
-Yeah.
-All right.

25:09.875 --> 25:11.875
[horns honking]

25:17.666 --> 25:20.416
[Jenna] There's something about that guy.
He drives me crazy.

25:20.500 --> 25:23.041
And he just knows how to irk me.

25:23.125 --> 25:25.958
Well, he's Darcy Hale's son.
He's probably half demon.

25:26.041 --> 25:29.958
I can't even… I can't even trip off at him
because I don't feel like myself now.

25:30.041 --> 25:31.916
I don't… I don't feel like I have it.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
I feel rusty. I'm struggling.

25:34.083 --> 25:37.041
I've researched
and pitched out this whole concept.

25:37.625 --> 25:41.083
And now I'm like, "Can I even deliver?"
I don't feel like I can.

25:41.166 --> 25:43.291
Of course you can.

25:44.083 --> 25:48.291
Everybody has imposter syndrome,
but you just gotta dig deep.

25:48.375 --> 25:50.500
Find what excites you, Jenna.
You got this.

25:50.583 --> 25:53.458
-Problem is he excites me.
-There's that.

25:53.541 --> 25:56.125
-That's the problem.
-You gotta find what else excites ya.

25:56.208 --> 25:58.750
-Yeah, what else?
-Excites you more.

25:58.833 --> 26:00.833
["Apache Dance" plays]

26:19.708 --> 26:21.583
Hi. Is it really you?

26:21.666 --> 26:22.958
Oh my God.

26:23.458 --> 26:25.291
Your pieces are stunning.

26:25.375 --> 26:27.416
Thank you so much.
This is one of my favorite pieces.

26:27.500 --> 26:29.791
-Superb work.
-[woman] Thank you.

26:29.875 --> 26:31.791
-What… What's your name?
-Becca Jay.

26:31.875 --> 26:32.708
Becca Jay.

26:32.791 --> 26:36.000
Here's my card.
I'm here every week, so come see me.

26:36.083 --> 26:37.416
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

26:40.958 --> 26:42.583
-Oh, what you got there?
-Find anything?

26:42.666 --> 26:43.666
-Right?
-That's cute.

26:43.750 --> 26:45.250
-That looks good.
-Super cute.

26:45.333 --> 26:46.166
I love that.

26:46.250 --> 26:48.000
That'd be nice for date night.

26:48.083 --> 26:50.708
Well, I'd have to get a date
for date night. That part.

26:50.791 --> 26:53.208
Well, I may have a guy
that I wanna introduce you to.

26:53.291 --> 26:54.291
-No!
-What guy?

26:54.375 --> 26:55.250
Jenna!

26:55.333 --> 26:57.333
-Don't say no so fast.
-Hello?

26:57.416 --> 27:00.458
This guy is solid.
He… He owns the wine shop.

27:00.541 --> 27:03.125
Bubbles and Brew? He's 50 years old.

27:03.208 --> 27:05.750
-He can spell. He can write.
-He can spell!

27:05.833 --> 27:07.625
-He can spell.
-Okay.

27:07.708 --> 27:10.333
-Might be a eater of pussies.
-That's all you had to say.

27:10.416 --> 27:11.666
-Okay, sold.
-[woman] Sold.

27:11.750 --> 27:16.125
And I can't be turning down dates,
not when they doing all that.

27:16.208 --> 27:17.791
-There you go.
-Yeah.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.041
Jenna, this came for you.

27:23.125 --> 27:25.000
Oh. Thank you, guys.

27:25.083 --> 27:26.291
[both] You're welcome.

27:33.791 --> 27:36.500
"I hear a welcome back is in order.
Would love to catch up."

27:36.583 --> 27:38.333
"Until then, coffee on me."

27:38.875 --> 27:41.125
Brian. Asshole.

27:44.458 --> 27:45.583
Wanna talk about it?

27:45.666 --> 27:48.625
Absolutely not,
but I did wanna speak with you.

27:48.708 --> 27:49.708
About?

27:51.041 --> 27:55.458
Yeah, I want to apologize
for upsetting you last Friday.

27:55.541 --> 27:56.875
I'm not upset.

27:56.958 --> 27:58.791
-You were upset.
-Nah, I'm good.

27:58.875 --> 28:01.916
I just think maybe we shouldn't
talk about our personal lives at work.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.416
Agreed.

28:03.500 --> 28:06.291
Uh, and I would appreciate it

28:06.375 --> 28:11.291
if you would stop making references
to me… being old and bitter.

28:11.958 --> 28:13.041
Nah. Nah, I hear you.

28:13.125 --> 28:16.958
Um, I mean, you kind of started it with
the whole being spoiled, being a brat,

28:17.041 --> 28:19.500
talking 'bout my generation,
that whole spiel.

28:19.583 --> 28:22.500
It's kind of corny, but…
Yeah, yep. No, I hear you.

28:23.208 --> 28:24.250
So…

28:26.125 --> 28:27.416
-Truce?
-Truce.

28:28.666 --> 28:31.083
Hey, the other day in the cab, um,

28:31.166 --> 28:35.208
you were talking about how,
you know, your career is riding on this.

28:35.291 --> 28:36.416
Yeah, 'cause it is.

28:36.500 --> 28:38.916
This is super lame… Lame!

28:39.000 --> 28:41.250
…but I Googled you,

28:41.333 --> 28:43.625
and you're kind of a big deal.

28:43.708 --> 28:46.125
You know, I don't get any of this.

28:46.208 --> 28:50.791
Shit. You saw that I went through
a terrible breakup, got fired from my job,

28:50.875 --> 28:53.750
and have been enduring

28:53.833 --> 28:56.416
painful, vicious memes of myself

28:56.500 --> 28:58.000
for over a year.

28:58.083 --> 29:01.000
-That was all on the first page.
-It was my rock bottom.

29:01.625 --> 29:05.750
-Is that from Rock Bottom?
-No more personal questions. Okay.

29:05.833 --> 29:09.500
Why you got a picture of your grandma?
She kind of fine. That's all I'm sayin'.

29:11.375 --> 29:13.166
-[Jenna] Stop.
-[Eric] Ah.

29:13.708 --> 29:16.958
Nah. Nah, I'm just kidding. Gotcha.

29:17.041 --> 29:18.625
That's Nina Mae McKinney,

29:18.708 --> 29:22.083
star of Hallelujah,
first all-Black film in 1929.

29:22.166 --> 29:24.250
-They called her the Black Garbo.
-Black Garbo.

29:24.791 --> 29:27.500
Yeah. She does kind of favor you though.

29:27.583 --> 29:28.500
You think?

29:29.166 --> 29:30.416
Yeah, same cheeks.

29:31.583 --> 29:32.500
Thank you.

29:34.041 --> 29:37.666
I'm kind of obsessed with her.
I mean, she was such a trailblazer, and…

29:38.833 --> 29:40.791
I don't know.
I just love old Hollywood movies.

29:40.875 --> 29:42.250
Likewise.

29:42.333 --> 29:45.041
It's like time traveling
to a version of humanity.

29:45.125 --> 29:47.250
I could have never imagined this.

29:47.333 --> 29:48.583
Look at you.

29:49.916 --> 29:53.833
Seriously, I've… I've never met anyone
who knows anything about Nina Mae.

29:55.916 --> 29:58.041
Master's in film from USC, remember?

29:58.125 --> 29:59.458
Put to good use.

30:00.041 --> 30:02.125
Jenna, your dress came in.

30:02.208 --> 30:05.125
Oh, yeah. You can put it right over there.
Thank you.

30:05.708 --> 30:10.250
-Ha! Perks of the gig.
-[Eric] Hmm.

30:10.333 --> 30:13.666
Yes, a showroom sent over this sample.

30:13.750 --> 30:16.166
-What do you think?
-It's nice. Special occasion?

30:16.250 --> 30:17.916
Yeah, I'm throwing a little dinner party.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.333
My friends are setting me up with someone.

30:20.416 --> 30:23.375
Oh. Okay, so you out here?

30:24.000 --> 30:24.958
You should come.

30:25.708 --> 30:27.416
You want me to come?

30:27.500 --> 30:30.958
You should come to my dinner party.
Bring your friends. More the merrier.

30:31.041 --> 30:33.708
Okay, so now you trippin'.
My friends? You sure?

30:33.791 --> 30:36.041
Yeah, I mean, now that we're friends,

30:36.125 --> 30:38.083
you know,
your friends are my friends, right?

30:38.166 --> 30:39.916
It'll take the pressure off. I promise.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.916
All right. We'll come through.

30:42.000 --> 30:42.875
Great.

30:44.166 --> 30:46.166
-[laughing]
-Mm-hmm.

Oh, I miss these Jenna parties,

30:48.958 --> 30:51.208
and it's the perfect way
for you to meet the guy.

30:51.291 --> 30:55.333
Yes, and we're all about to get real good
and saucy real soon.

30:55.416 --> 30:56.333
All right.

30:57.083 --> 30:59.250
-This is needed for the occasion.
-Okay.

30:59.333 --> 31:02.375
All right. Billie, here. Little shot.

-What?

31:04.333 --> 31:05.541
-It's good.
-Okay.

31:05.625 --> 31:06.958
But… But what'd you put in it?

31:07.041 --> 31:09.208
Don't worry about it. Just keep drinking.

31:09.791 --> 31:11.000
I gotta pace myself.

31:12.083 --> 31:14.250
-[doorbell rings]
-[woman] Mmm. Mmm.

31:14.333 --> 31:16.166
-So we gotta turn up.
-Yep, just turn up.

31:16.250 --> 31:18.333
-All right, let's go.
-"Milly Rock." Ding-dong!

31:20.291 --> 31:22.458
-Come on up!
-Okay. Okay, we got this.

31:22.541 --> 31:23.375
[woman] All right.

31:23.458 --> 31:25.375
-[Jenna] Hey!
-Yo. What up?

31:25.958 --> 31:26.916
[Jenna] How are you?

31:27.000 --> 31:28.250
[both chuckle]

31:28.333 --> 31:30.250
Uh, this is my boy, Tim,
and his girl, Carlita.

31:30.333 --> 31:31.625

-Pleasure.

-Oh, that's what you were thinking about?
-Yes, Eric. Movies.

42:48.875 --> 42:51.750
-Okay, Jenna, what hit you?
-Nostalgia. Right?

42:51.833 --> 42:53.333
Every time I watch an old movie,

42:53.416 --> 42:56.625
there's always going to be one garment
that I'm like, "I would kill for that."

42:56.708 --> 43:00.541
Like a bathrobe
or a spectacularly tailored dress

43:00.625 --> 43:04.416
or a gold belt or a fur muff.
Then you're always left thinking--

43:04.500 --> 43:06.333
"They don't make things
like they used to."

43:06.416 --> 43:08.458
But what if they did? What if they did?

43:08.541 --> 43:11.916
Last weekend, I met a designer who makes
the most fabulously constructed items,

43:12.000 --> 43:13.833
and they're all reclaimed vintage.

43:13.916 --> 43:16.875
Her craftsmanship is couture-level.

43:17.583 --> 43:19.500
-Okay, no, I like where this is going.
-Okay.

-Like, who is that?
-Right. Um…

43:31.583 --> 43:32.416
Remy!

43:33.791 --> 43:35.125
[Eric] Oh shit. That's Remy Ma.

43:35.625 --> 43:38.458
Mama, thank you. Thank you.

43:38.541 --> 43:40.625
Of course. Anything for you.
You know that.

43:40.708 --> 43:42.208

-Of course.

43:42.291 --> 43:44.416

You know, for obvious reasons,

46:54.333 --> 46:55.208
Why?

46:56.250 --> 47:00.041
Do I have to spell it out for you?
Five letters. Starts with a D.

47:01.250 --> 47:03.583
Come on, now. My mom doesn't run us.

47:04.416 --> 47:06.125
Like, honestly,
we can start our own thing.

47:06.208 --> 47:09.625
We could take over this whole film
and fashion scene. These are our ideas.

47:09.708 --> 47:11.541
Yes, they may be our ideas,

47:11.625 --> 47:15.833
but they will go nowhere without
a real, legit company to put them into.

47:17.583 --> 47:21.833
Look, your mom may be a raving narcissist,
but it has put her at the top of the game.

47:21.916 --> 47:25.333
Wow! I never thought
I'd hear you defend her.

47:25.416 --> 47:26.958
-No, I'm not defending her.
-Wow.

47:27.041 --> 47:30.875

is now attached to hers.

47:32.583 --> 47:34.000
And what future is that?

47:36.000 --> 47:37.500
A future of respect

47:38.041 --> 47:41.208

47:41.291 --> 47:45.375

but he was, uh…
He was mixed up in some mess.

50:26.291 --> 50:27.666

50:28.750 --> 50:30.791
That must've been hard
for you and your mom.

50:31.583 --> 50:36.541
Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't know.
She isn't exactly an open book about it.

50:37.041 --> 50:40.291

50:40.375 --> 50:42.000
but then, like, never again.

50:42.083 --> 50:43.791
And I don't wanna upset her,

52:09.416 --> 52:12.291

given up on my dream.

01:27:09.166 --> 01:27:10.625
[speaking Spanish]

01:27:13.416 --> 01:27:16.583
Oh, and Eric was the most beautiful baby.

01:27:24.458 --> 01:27:26.583
And when his father was killed…

01:27:30.291 --> 01:27:32.208
my parents didn't come to the funeral.

01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:40.791
So it's… it's just been
the two of us ever since.

01:27:44.375 --> 01:27:46.916
-I'm so sorry.
-Don't you dare feel sorry for me.

01:27:49.625 --> 01:27:51.000
Made me stronger.

01:27:51.666 --> 01:27:57.375
My fierceness as a mother
became my fierceness professionally,

01:27:58.166 --> 01:28:00.666
because I had him to fight for.

01:28:01.666 --> 01:28:03.208
I had a son to raise.

01:28:04.250 --> 01:28:05.291
My son.

01:28:06.958 --> 01:28:07.875
[sniffles]

01:28:08.541 --> 01:28:11.625
Now, I don't know whose karma this is,

01:28:11.708 --> 01:28:14.666
but your trajectory is impressive.

01:28:17.958 --> 01:28:20.083
But I won't do to you
what my parents did to me.

01:28:23.583 --> 01:28:27.333
That cycle ends here… with me.

01:28:28.916 --> 01:28:32.000
Like it or not, we're family now.

01:28:38.666 --> 01:28:39.541
[Eric] Yo.

01:28:41.416 --> 01:28:42.458

[chuckles]

01:28:47.541 --> 01:28:50.958
You know, I got my ears to the streets.
I figured this out.

01:28:52.166 --> 01:28:53.041
Who told you?

01:28:53.625 --> 01:28:54.750
[Eric] Take a guess.

01:28:54.833 --> 01:28:57.666
Oh, and it's a boy.
You're carrying in your ass.

01:28:57.750 --> 01:28:59.375

01:28:59.458 --> 01:29:00.500
What the hell?

01:29:02.333 --> 01:29:03.708
We're having a baby.

01:29:04.458 --> 01:29:06.250
[Eric] You know I'm not ready for this.

01:29:06.333 --> 01:29:09.250
I'm young, yeah, but my mom
was way younger when she had me,

01:29:09.833 --> 01:29:12.125
and you still mean the world to me.

01:29:12.916 --> 01:29:14.333
I don't wanna miss this.

Looks like you won't have to.

01:29:23.166 --> 01:29:24.791
[sighs] All right.

01:29:24.875 --> 01:29:26.458
Ooh. [chuckles]

01:29:27.208 --> 01:29:32.125
Look's good in here.
I believe this right here indicates

01:29:32.875 --> 01:29:35.291
a healthy baby boy is on the way.

-Thank you.

Yo. That's crazy.

-Can you believe it?
-[laughs]

01:29:52.333 --> 01:29:53.875
Wow, we did that.

01:29:53.958 --> 01:29:55.083
We definitely did.

01:29:56.208 --> 01:29:57.291
Wow.

01:29:58.833 --> 01:29:59.916
So, um…

01:30:01.458 --> 01:30:04.000
what do you think about the name Otis?

01:30:06.833 --> 01:30:07.916
[chuckles]

01:30:10.750 --> 01:30:11.583
Wow.

01:30:14.041 --> 01:30:19.083
You know, I didn't know much about my dad,
but my son will know everything about me.

01:30:21.125 --> 01:30:22.125
He will.

01:30:24.458 --> 01:30:26.500
But, you know,
Otis is gonna have my last name too.

01:30:28.041 --> 01:30:29.416
Deal. I like that.

01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:30.541
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

01:30:30.625 --> 01:30:32.916
Otis Jones Hill. Two last names.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.666
-Sounds like a rock star.
-Yeah. I'm the pappy.

-[laughs]
-I love it. All right.

01:30:37.708 --> 01:30:39.791
Ooh, I almost forgot. Almost forgot.

-Oh, what's this?
-It's a paternity test.

01:30:42.458 --> 01:30:44.500
Yeah. It's for my mom.

01:30:44.583 --> 01:30:45.708
What?

01:30:45.791 --> 01:30:47.166
Mm-hmm. From Darcy.

01:30:47.250 --> 01:30:49.416
Nah, I'm just messing with you. [chuckles]

01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:52.333
You almost died.
You almost… You almost died just then.

It's two tickets to her gala.

01:30:55.416 --> 01:30:56.416

01:30:57.333 --> 01:30:58.291
Of course.
