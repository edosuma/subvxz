00:14.847 --> 00:18.083
<i>I saw a beast coming out of the sea.</i>

00:20.253 --> 00:23.621
<i>It deceived the inhabitants
of the earth...</i>

00:24.958 --> 00:30.128
<i>And forced all people to receive
a mark on their right hands,</i>

00:31.030 --> 00:34.098
<i>which is the number of the beast.</i>

00:35.402 --> 00:40.939
<i>And that number is 6-6-6.</i>

00:43.042 --> 00:47.648
I know your type. You act tough,
but you just want to fall in love.

00:57.658 --> 01:00.025
You have a funny nose.

01:00.393 --> 01:03.931
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

01:04.031 --> 01:05.900
It's like a weird shape.

01:06.300 --> 01:08.870
Our babies would have funny noses.

01:10.404 --> 01:12.637
Have you thought about
what I told you?

01:13.406 --> 01:15.473
About my Uncle?

01:18.578 --> 01:21.813
I just have to play some
dumb game with him, right?

01:22.382 --> 01:23.915
Yeah.

01:26.519 --> 01:28.786
Are you gonna come with me?

01:30.389 --> 01:33.394
I can take you there, but you
have to play the game by yourself.

01:33.494 --> 01:35.593
Those are the rules.

01:43.503 --> 01:45.069
Okay.

02:20.807 --> 02:22.273
Hey.

02:22.642 --> 02:23.811
One second.

02:27.480 --> 02:29.950
Hey, Mike. This is the
girl I told you about.

02:30.050 --> 02:32.684
She's on vacation. I think...

02:36.423 --> 02:38.893
No, she doesn't know anything.
She doesn't know.

02:39.393 --> 02:41.862
- Really? Nothing?
- No, she doesn't know anything.

02:47.301 --> 02:49.002
No, no, no, no, no.

02:53.906 --> 02:55.576
So, all you have to is play the game.

02:55.676 --> 02:58.512
- That's it.
- He's not a pervert, right?

02:59.214 --> 03:00.347
You'd like that.

03:02.883 --> 03:06.584
- Yeah, I don't... I don't know.
- It's $500.

03:07.120 --> 03:09.887
You said you don't
think it's real, right?

03:14.627 --> 03:16.861
You remember what
you said to me last night?

03:19.298 --> 03:21.199
Say it again.

03:24.070 --> 03:25.770
I love you.

03:53.866 --> 03:56.300
Put your hand in there and pick one.

04:03.609 --> 04:04.676
Go ahead.

04:41.781 --> 04:45.817
- Three times to see if you're special.
- Right.

04:57.029 --> 04:58.796
Choose one.

05:28.695 --> 05:30.328
Nice.

05:45.111 --> 05:46.513
Last time.

06:10.570 --> 06:12.637
He's chosen you.

06:19.847 --> 06:21.386
Don't touch.

06:27.152 --> 06:29.890
Now, I'll give you this

06:29.990 --> 06:33.824
if you go down to where the
roads meet and say your name.

06:34.627 --> 06:36.260
Why?

06:37.263 --> 06:40.631
So he knows your name
when he calls for you.

06:43.269 --> 06:49.877
See, you're the vessel, the bridge
around for the left-hand path.

06:50.177 --> 06:53.545
And one day, he will come.

06:58.818 --> 07:00.452
You'll be perfect.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.382
Yeah.

07:31.851 --> 07:35.656
Yeah. And he has
these cute little freckles.

07:35.756 --> 07:38.926
He's adorable, and his hair
is exactly... his hair is exactly

07:39.026 --> 07:42.546
what you would expect someone
from California to have for hair.

07:43.095 --> 07:47.866
Lori, I swear I didn't sleep with him,
but I still want him to be my first.

07:49.702 --> 07:52.800
I don't know if I'm ever
gonna see him again.

07:54.626 --> 07:57.308
No, I know. I know. You have to go.

07:58.811 --> 08:00.411
Okay.

08:01.748 --> 08:05.683
No, my parents are at choir.

08:07.019 --> 08:08.686
Okay.

08:09.322 --> 08:10.888
Bye.

09:13.886 --> 09:15.553
Come to me.

14:13.887 --> 14:16.761
Prices continue to shrink
over the past two decades,

14:16.861 --> 14:19.826
more and more families
are slipping into poverty.

14:19.926 --> 14:22.829
People once with a guarantee
of good jobs and schools

14:22.929 --> 14:25.532
and benefits are struggling
to make ends meet...

14:25.632 --> 14:27.868
Where police are blocking the
ramp because of an action

14:27.968 --> 14:30.703
involving a gunman held
up inside his house

14:30.803 --> 14:34.674
rain is forecast in the next
24 hours, and don't expect...

14:34.774 --> 14:38.812
Safety net is guaranteed,
as long as they worked hard.

14:38.912 --> 14:40.847
They wanted their kids to do better.

14:40.947 --> 14:44.114
Well, this is <i> not</i> doing better.

15:05.437 --> 15:07.640
Vera. It's Sunday.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.973
Yeah. It's morning.

15:11.877 --> 15:14.780
- I always get lost coming here.
- Still?

15:14.980 --> 15:17.406
It's your fault.
You're always moving.

15:20.953 --> 15:24.324
Oh, my God, these are so adorable.

15:24.424 --> 15:25.758
Thank you for making these.

15:26.859 --> 15:28.828
I look like such a spaz in that one.

15:28.928 --> 15:31.364
What are you talking about?
Look. We're perfect.

15:38.970 --> 15:41.505
Oh, but this...

15:43.409 --> 15:46.747
- It's still my favorite.
- You can have it.

15:47.247 --> 15:48.815
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:49.115 --> 15:53.317
I hate looking at the stuff I did as a
teenager. It's like someone else made it.

15:56.589 --> 15:57.922
Oh...

16:00.026 --> 16:01.459
He's here.

16:06.800 --> 16:10.638
- Hi. I'm Vera's sister.
- Hey. Sorry. I'm sorry.

16:11.938 --> 16:14.240
You don't...
You don't sound like her.

16:16.275 --> 16:18.845
I wasn't born here. She was.

16:20.846 --> 16:26.219
Well, you both must have had a
very pretty mom, for sure. Right?

16:30.390 --> 16:32.523
Our parents are dead.

16:45.582 --> 16:46.671
Nice, Vera.

16:47.606 --> 16:49.175
He's cute.

17:13.839 --> 17:15.066
Hey.

17:15.867 --> 17:19.739
Yeah, I can go see a property now.
Is it a foreclosure?

17:20.625 --> 17:23.675
It's not? Okay, good. How far is it?

17:23.875 --> 17:27.046
No, no, no, I can go.
I want this. Thank you.

17:32.818 --> 17:36.857
No. Come on. Just consider
it an early birthday present.

17:37.057 --> 17:39.292
- Come on. I want to pay for your work.
- No, really, it's fine.

17:39.392 --> 17:40.694
I'm gonna make money at my
show this week, anyway.

17:40.794 --> 17:43.074
I know, honey,
but I want to pay for them.

17:46.531 --> 17:47.500
Okay.

17:47.600 --> 17:51.335
I'm so proud of you.
I'll see you later, okay?

20:34.699 --> 20:35.933
Hey.

20:38.136 --> 20:42.139
Hey, I'm... I'm just here
to look at the house.

20:54.319 --> 20:58.458
My parents moved to this country for
a better life, and I still believe in that.

20:58.558 --> 21:00.829
I know I can get you a
great price on your house,

21:00.929 --> 21:05.498
even with all the bad news out there.
So, let me tell you a bit about who I am.

21:05.598 --> 21:08.768
I've been an agent for five years.
I love putting people in homes

21:08.868 --> 21:11.538
because it offers families an
opportunity for something better.

21:11.638 --> 21:14.674
- I work every day, evenings, too.
- That's great.

21:14.774 --> 21:17.777
That's perfect, just...
just exactly what we're looking for.

21:17.877 --> 21:22.181
We... we do want to sell
this house, and I think,

21:22.281 --> 21:24.884
Leigh... I think you're the person
to do it. I think you'll be great.

21:24.984 --> 21:27.608
We do want to get it on
the market as soon as possible,

21:27.708 --> 21:30.690
by the end of the week,
if you could do it.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.458
Of this week.

21:33.571 --> 21:34.793
I'll try.

21:35.093 --> 21:39.666
Okay. There's something else
I-I supposed we should talk about.

21:40.266 --> 21:41.944
It's a little difficult,

21:42.044 --> 21:44.980
but we've been negligent on the
mortgage the last few months.

21:45.081 --> 21:49.542
It's just really been hard.
I got laid off. We have to sell it.

21:49.742 --> 21:51.645
You know, one day we're
gonna get back on our feet,

21:51.745 --> 21:54.781
and we'll probably buy another house
and m-maybe even buy it from you.

21:55.181 --> 21:58.084
I mean, let's get your home sold.

22:01.220 --> 22:04.893
There is some furniture in there.
Are you gonna remove it?

22:04.993 --> 22:08.494
No. When we bought the
house back in... '89?

22:08.594 --> 22:09.862
- '88.
- '88.

22:09.962 --> 22:10.730
Yeah.

22:10.830 --> 22:13.900
That furniture was in there, and we don't
need it anymore, so we'll just leave it.

22:14.100 --> 22:18.035
Okay. And, I saw there was a fire.

22:19.638 --> 22:23.242
Yes, there was a fire. That happened
one night while we were out.

22:23.342 --> 22:28.078
But really no damage,
mostly cosmetic.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.404
Yeah.

22:30.650 --> 22:33.053
One of my jobs is
listing disclosures,

22:33.153 --> 22:36.422
anything that's wrong with the house,
anything that can raise a flag to buyers.

22:36.522 --> 22:40.726
I understand. So, everything's fine.
We'll get you a list of disclosures.

22:40.826 --> 22:44.664
I mean, we love this house.
We... we didn't want to have to sell it.

22:44.764 --> 22:46.733
We raised our daughter there.

22:48.067 --> 22:50.300
I think she stopped by this morning.

22:51.737 --> 22:54.808
- Charlene? Petite, short hair...
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

22:54.908 --> 22:56.373
You saw her?

22:57.376 --> 22:58.644
Yeah.

23:01.079 --> 23:04.350
Our daughter ran off with a
boyfriend a couple months ago.

23:04.450 --> 23:05.351
Oh.

23:05.451 --> 23:07.787
So, you saw her at the house.
What was she doing there?

23:07.887 --> 23:12.422
I don't know.
She came in when I was there.

23:12.691 --> 23:15.695
And she ran off when
I tried to talk to her.

23:15.795 --> 23:19.365
Yeah. You know what?
I'm sorry to have to do this.

23:19.465 --> 23:20.933
I-I think we've got
to talk to the police.

23:21.033 --> 23:22.713
- We've been looking for her.
- I understand.

23:24.102 --> 23:28.808
You know, she's a great kid,
and then just something happened.

23:29.008 --> 23:32.145
Yeah. Yeah. I'm... I'm so sorry.

23:32.245 --> 23:35.291
I'll schedule an inspection,
with your permission?

23:35.391 --> 23:37.750
Absolutely. Let's do that
as soon as possible, okay?

23:37.850 --> 23:39.452
We'll get you those
disclosures tomorrow.

23:39.552 --> 23:40.987
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

23:41.087 --> 23:42.119
Bye.

24:44.649 --> 24:48.254
I'm not crazy. I'm not crazy.
I'm not crazy. I'm not crazy.

24:48.354 --> 24:50.690
I'm not crazy. I'm not crazy.
I'm not crazy. I'm not crazy.

25:33.431 --> 25:36.002
Through all this, Jonah sleeps.

25:36.402 --> 25:39.205
He doesn't see the enraging sea

25:39.305 --> 25:42.942
or the far rush of the mighty whale.

25:43.042 --> 25:45.646
Then at last a frightened
sailor comes to him

25:45.746 --> 25:50.580
and screams in his ear,
"oh, sleeper, arise."

25:51.116 --> 25:54.118
And, startled,
Jonah staggers to his feet...

26:10.970 --> 26:12.902
Leigh, line 4.

26:14.974 --> 26:17.476
Another foreclosure went up.
You want to take this one?

26:23.214 --> 26:26.349
I'm sorry. I-I don't think
I'm gonna get that.

26:56.382 --> 26:57.847
Whoa.

28:41.786 --> 28:43.089
- Hello?
- Fairfield security.

28:43.189 --> 28:47.259
- Your pin code, please?
- Yes, 1512.

28:47.359 --> 28:49.395
Is everything okay?
Would you like assistance?

28:49.495 --> 28:51.330
Yes, please. Send someone right now.

28:51.430 --> 28:54.330
- We'll be there shortly.
- Thank you.

31:13.104 --> 31:14.871
Shit.

31:33.758 --> 31:36.662
- Hey.
- Hey, Vera. Honey, I'm so sorry.

31:36.762 --> 31:39.165
- I think I'm gonna be late tonight.
- It's fine.

31:39.965 --> 31:42.234
I'm stuck in this inspection.

31:42.434 --> 31:45.104
But as soon as it's done,
I'm gonna be right over, okay?

31:45.304 --> 31:47.873
Okay. It's totally fine.

31:47.973 --> 31:50.776
I know it's fine,
but it's your night.

31:50.876 --> 31:54.613
It's your opening, so I just...
I don't know. I just want to be there.

31:54.713 --> 31:56.115
Look, it really doesn't matter, okay?

31:56.215 --> 31:59.918
The show's gonna stay up,
and this is a pretty lame party.

32:00.018 --> 32:02.518
Well, at least...

32:02.720 --> 32:04.857
- Did that boy show up?
- Stop.

32:04.957 --> 32:09.528
- What? He seemed so nice.
- No, no, no. I know where this is going.

32:09.628 --> 32:11.797
Don't make believe you're
not looking for someone.

32:11.897 --> 32:16.335
No, I'm not, Leigh. For the
hundredth time, I'm not like you.

32:16.435 --> 32:20.257
I'm never gonna get married and I'm
never gonna have a perfect little house

32:20.357 --> 32:23.275
and I'm never gonna have
perfect little kids, all right?

32:23.375 --> 32:27.113
Right. You're never gonna have kids.

32:27.813 --> 32:30.549
- Well, who's going to, then?
- I didn't mean it like that.

32:30.649 --> 32:33.252
Not me. Not my own.

32:33.352 --> 32:36.855
Leigh, did you see another doctor?

32:36.955 --> 32:38.757
No, I just...

32:39.900 --> 32:45.564
I'm sorry. Look, I'm...
I know I'm a little crazy. I just...

32:49.834 --> 32:52.535
I feel really alone sometimes.

32:54.739 --> 32:58.841
I know you don't understand anything
that I'm talking about right now, but...

33:00.678 --> 33:02.411
I love you.

33:03.481 --> 33:05.414
I love you very much.

33:06.417 --> 33:09.719
- And I'm gonna be there tonight, okay?
- Okay.

33:10.321 --> 33:13.723
Well... I'll see you soon.

33:14.192 --> 33:15.691
Yeah.

33:27.769 --> 33:28.938
Shit.

34:05.444 --> 34:06.345
Hey.

34:08.213 --> 34:09.612
Charlene?

34:11.782 --> 34:13.315
Wait.

34:13.451 --> 34:15.051
Charlene?

34:22.260 --> 34:23.693
Charlene.

34:27.031 --> 34:29.130
I talked to your mom and dad.

34:33.004 --> 34:34.971
They're worried about you.

34:46.484 --> 34:48.184
Let me help you.

34:58.796 --> 35:01.064
You're lucky I keep this in my car.

35:03.468 --> 35:06.002
I left a message for your parents.

35:10.711 --> 35:12.577
Is that why you came back?

35:14.579 --> 35:16.345
To get the money?

35:25.055 --> 35:27.290
That's my sister... Vera.

35:28.192 --> 35:30.059
She's an artist.

35:30.561 --> 35:32.828
She's a special person...

35:33.497 --> 35:35.298
Kind of dark.

35:36.967 --> 35:40.036
I just want her to find
someone and have kids.

35:52.516 --> 35:53.950
Excuse me.

35:58.989 --> 36:01.458
It's Vera. Leave me a message.

36:02.159 --> 36:05.528
Vera, I'm so sorry I've
been so held up here.

36:06.030 --> 36:08.125
I'm still in Greenville.

36:08.400 --> 36:11.848
There's a girl who I think has
been living here. She's with me.

36:12.770 --> 36:14.439
There's something wrong with her.

36:16.208 --> 36:18.812
I-I'll tell you more later. I love you.

36:20.312 --> 36:21.947
- Hello?
- Yeah. Hey. It's Chuck.

36:22.047 --> 36:25.951
- We saw that you called.
- Hi, Chuck. This is, Leigh.

36:26.051 --> 36:29.988
- I'm with Charlene.
- I'm sorry. I don't understand.

36:30.088 --> 36:32.054
Charlene, your daughter.

36:32.656 --> 36:36.993
The police picked Charlene up a couple
hours ago at a shopping center in Marion.

36:37.294 --> 36:40.098
But she's right here in your house.

36:40.198 --> 36:44.400
Well, I'm looking at her right now.
I mean, I know my own daughter.

36:57.181 --> 36:58.814
Are you there?

37:01.185 --> 37:03.293
I'm sorry. I-I'll call you back.

37:23.073 --> 37:24.907
Who are you?

37:33.117 --> 37:34.650
Tell me who you are.

37:38.022 --> 37:40.657
You're not the one I want.

38:48.793 --> 38:50.729
Green's played his best...

39:15.652 --> 39:17.052
Honey?

39:17.554 --> 39:20.055
Why haven't you left yet, sweetie?

39:31.436 --> 39:35.206
Honey, you're gonna
be late for babysitting.

39:36.540 --> 39:40.709
Is everything okay?
They're expecting you at 8:00.

39:50.020 --> 39:52.390
Oh, hey. Oh, hey, come on in.

39:54.300 --> 39:55.560
Yeah.

39:55.860 --> 40:00.476
Becky's feeding Lucilla right now.
They're down the hall, to the right.

40:10.507 --> 40:11.709
Hi.

40:16.280 --> 40:17.947
Here she is.

40:21.285 --> 40:23.986
Sometimes it slips inside me.

40:26.990 --> 40:28.357
What?

41:46.670 --> 41:51.055
So, they're talking 35 square foot
for the units. There's only 12 units.

41:51.155 --> 41:53.812
I'm thinking, "I can't make that deal."

41:53.912 --> 41:56.248
Am I wrong? It's like,
"This is... This is wholesale.

41:56.348 --> 41:58.817
You're... that's retail, man.
Take it to the shopping mall.

41:58.917 --> 42:00.919
- I-I can't deal with that."
- Yeah, it's...

42:01.019 --> 42:02.087
Oh, looking a little light, sweetie.

42:02.187 --> 42:03.888
- Can I, refill?
- Yes.

42:03.988 --> 42:04.889
- All right.
- Thank you.

42:04.989 --> 42:06.320
Be right back.

42:53.938 --> 42:55.171
Wh...

42:56.173 --> 42:59.074
What's the... What's...
what's the matter?

43:01.478 --> 43:03.445
Where's Lucilla?

43:04.148 --> 43:08.183
Where is she? Hey! Where's my baby?

43:08.585 --> 43:10.922
Your fucking baby's dead.

43:13.690 --> 43:15.591
You're all dead.

43:16.193 --> 43:18.324
Baby, oh, no.

43:23.601 --> 43:27.338
She's not here! She's not here,
Davis! Oh, my God!

43:36.475 --> 43:38.283
Oh, God, she's upstairs!

43:38.383 --> 43:42.120
She's upstairs! She's upstairs!
Oh, my God!

43:43.888 --> 43:45.155
Wait.

43:49.460 --> 43:51.121
Where's my baby?

43:54.799 --> 43:55.812
Okay.

43:56.035 --> 43:59.802
- Hold on. Hold on. I'm gonna lift on top.
- She's right here. Oh, my God!

44:05.610 --> 44:08.346
Oh, my God.

44:08.446 --> 44:09.948
It's okay, baby. It's okay.

44:10.048 --> 44:12.481
Oh, my baby!

44:14.418 --> 44:16.418
It's okay, honey.

44:40.027 --> 44:42.949
Our father who are in heaven,

44:43.049 --> 44:46.048
hallowed be thy name. Thy...

44:48.318 --> 44:51.300
Our father, who art in heaven,

44:51.400 --> 44:54.023
hallowed be thy name. Thy...

44:55.259 --> 44:56.659
Thy...

47:00.451 --> 47:01.819
Hi!

47:01.919 --> 47:03.321
- Hi.
- How are you?

47:03.421 --> 47:04.690
- Good.
- Good to see you.

47:05.090 --> 47:06.457
- Hey.
- Oh.

47:06.757 --> 47:08.560
- Hey. How's it going?
- Good. How are you?

47:08.660 --> 47:10.195
Good. Congrats.

47:10.295 --> 47:13.698
- Thank you.
- It's amazing. This is amazing stuff.

47:16.034 --> 47:19.771
You gonna... you gonna
go out tonight after this?

47:23.573 --> 47:28.444
Well, you know, I'd... I'd really
like to hang out another time.

47:30.514 --> 47:35.384
Listen, Sam, thank you so much
for coming, but I don't think so.

47:38.101 --> 47:39.318
Really?

47:41.758 --> 47:43.699
Look, yeah, I-I just...

47:43.799 --> 47:48.734
I think of you up there in
that loft all alone, and...

47:49.334 --> 47:52.537
I don't know. I thought you
might want some company.

47:52.937 --> 47:56.274
We all need a little
company sometimes.

47:56.374 --> 47:57.739
Right?

48:00.477 --> 48:03.545
No. I don't.

48:42.486 --> 48:44.152
Vera...

48:45.188 --> 48:47.422
It's looking for a home.

49:03.340 --> 49:04.940
Hello?

49:10.513 --> 49:13.348
Yes. I'm her sister.

49:32.836 --> 49:35.237
Your sister's heart simply stopped.

49:36.172 --> 49:41.212
There are many possible reasons.
Hypertension, unexpected stress.

49:41.612 --> 49:43.678
It could have been genetic.

49:44.915 --> 49:47.048
She was 29.

49:47.818 --> 49:51.722
There's no signs of,
malice or foul play.

49:51.822 --> 49:55.564
There's no evidence of a struggle
or that anyone else was there.

49:56.059 --> 49:58.193
She died of heart failure.

49:59.196 --> 50:01.196
You're the only kin, right?

50:01.965 --> 50:04.116
I'm gonna give you the
address of the,

50:04.216 --> 50:08.021
impound yard where
you can find her car.

53:05.118 --> 53:10.352
Hey. It's me. Look, I was thinking.
I feel bad about fighting.

53:11.087 --> 53:13.424
And I know that family
is important to you,

53:13.524 --> 53:17.165
and sometimes I don't say
"I love you" back, so...

53:17.265 --> 53:20.998
I love you. Okay. I'll see you.

53:38.148 --> 53:41.486
Vera, I'm so sorry I've
been so held up here.

53:42.086 --> 53:43.889
I'm still in Greenville.

53:44.289 --> 53:47.989
There's a girl who I think has
been living here. She's with me.

53:48.591 --> 53:50.659
There's something wrong with her.

53:52.161 --> 53:55.047
I-I'll tell you more later.
I love you.

54:05.501 --> 54:06.675
Hello?

56:03.459 --> 56:05.193
Come to me.

56:15.606 --> 56:17.071
Hey.

56:18.108 --> 56:19.874
Hey, wait!

56:21.055 --> 56:22.410
Hey!

58:25.168 --> 58:28.202
My sister thought she
saw you in that house.

58:29.539 --> 58:32.573
I haven't been there in months.

58:34.711 --> 58:39.183
I talked to your parents, and they told
me that you asked to be put in here.

58:39.283 --> 58:42.183
Yeah. It's safer.

58:42.885 --> 58:44.886
What are you scared of?

58:45.421 --> 58:49.260
That house.
The girl in the red raincoat.

58:49.360 --> 58:52.193
I want to know everything
you know about her.

58:52.962 --> 58:57.535
When I was about 13 or 14,
I'm sure I saw her.

58:58.435 --> 59:03.161
I was playing in my backyard, and I looked
through a window into my parents room,

59:03.261 --> 59:06.110
and I saw that girl standing there.

59:06.210 --> 59:08.543
But I went in there,
and no one was there.

59:09.412 --> 59:12.783
So, all you ever saw was
this girl in the raincoat?

59:12.883 --> 59:16.372
Well, like a year ago, I switched
rooms with my parents because I...

59:16.472 --> 59:18.007
I said I liked the
view of the backyard,

59:18.107 --> 59:20.866
but really it was just so that
my boyfriend, Gus, could...

59:20.966 --> 59:22.966
sneak in through the window at night.

59:23.327 --> 59:25.623
One night, we were...

59:27.599 --> 59:30.835
doing it. And, I looked up

59:30.935 --> 59:34.872
and there was somebody standing
there in the mirror, watching us.

59:35.172 --> 59:36.607
The girl?

59:36.707 --> 59:39.877
No. No. It was a man.

59:39.977 --> 59:45.280
I mean, he was just standing over us,
and he was... he was all dark.

59:47.683 --> 59:49.794
After that, I had to get out of there.

59:51.521 --> 59:55.459
Your parents told Leigh that
you lit the fire in the house.

59:55.559 --> 59:57.425
She had that in her notes.

59:58.694 --> 01:00:00.795
I didn't light that fire.

01:00:01.464 --> 01:00:02.631
Who did?

01:00:06.569 --> 01:00:11.672
Well, ever since I touched the burned
wall in your house, this won't wash off.

01:00:19.782 --> 01:00:22.751
You know how you might
find out what's happening?

01:00:25.054 --> 01:00:28.290
Go find the girl next
to her, her friend.

01:00:33.529 --> 01:00:38.132
I remember that article because
of that photo. My dad took it.

01:00:39.902 --> 01:00:42.970
So, you said you saw her?

01:00:44.006 --> 01:00:45.076
Yeah.

01:00:45.476 --> 01:00:49.980
It was a tragedy, what happened
to Hannah. She had a good heart.

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:54.652
If she had lived, she would have
had kids and lived in the suburbs,

01:00:54.752 --> 01:00:57.352
despite all her acting out back then.

01:00:58.354 --> 01:01:01.756
We were good friends. I miss her.

01:01:02.692 --> 01:01:06.661
What about her suicide?
What happened?

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:12.869
After I saw what
happened with Hannah,

01:01:13.538 --> 01:01:16.972
it opened my eyes that there
are bad things in this world.

01:01:18.508 --> 01:01:20.541
There was a boy.

01:01:22.812 --> 01:01:25.516
And she met him when she
went out to visit California.

01:01:28.151 --> 01:01:30.451
I want to be with you forever.

01:01:39.962 --> 01:01:43.798
She told me this boy had talked
her into selling her soul.

01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:52.289
I want you to go down to where
the roads meet and say your name.

01:01:53.777 --> 01:01:56.811
So he knows your name
when he calls for you.

01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:25.172
Hannah.

01:02:41.223 --> 01:02:46.463
After she came back home,
she said someone was coming for her.

01:02:46.763 --> 01:02:50.439
And then when she looked in the
mirror sometimes, she would see him,

01:02:52.405 --> 01:02:54.035
and...

01:02:55.705 --> 01:02:57.674
That he could get inside her.

01:02:59.002 --> 01:03:03.280
And she said to me,
"he wants to be all of someone."

01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:05.646
I will never forget that.

01:03:08.084 --> 01:03:09.651
Did you believe her?

01:03:12.855 --> 01:03:14.489
Did you know she was pregnant?

01:03:17.026 --> 01:03:20.864
That's why her parents thought
that she killed herself.

01:03:20.964 --> 01:03:26.476
They found a pregnancy test and thought
she panicked and went crazy because of it.

01:03:31.007 --> 01:03:35.242
But Hannah told me something
she never told anybody else.

01:03:37.246 --> 01:03:39.219
She told me...

01:03:39.719 --> 01:03:41.819
she was a virgin.

01:03:45.321 --> 01:03:47.774
I think Hannah killed herself

01:03:47.874 --> 01:03:52.096
before whatever was happening to her
had a chance to finish what it was doing.

01:03:52.696 --> 01:03:57.365
And I think that whatever you saw
or maybe your sister saw wasn't her.

01:03:58.167 --> 01:04:00.760
I think it was whatever
had gotten inside of her,

01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:04.271
and I think it was wearing
her like a costume.

01:04:09.178 --> 01:04:13.448
He wants to be all of someone?
What does that mean?

01:04:15.985 --> 01:04:21.188
Maybe the best thing you can do is
get as far away from this as possible.

01:04:21.357 --> 01:04:23.894
Mom, I'm done!

01:04:23.994 --> 01:04:25.796
Do you want to wait?

01:04:25.896 --> 01:04:29.363
No. Thank you. I'm... I'm gonna go.

01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:31.732
Thank you, though.

01:04:35.471 --> 01:04:37.708
Hi, honey.
You get all clean in there?

01:04:37.808 --> 01:04:40.143
- Yeah.
- Oh. Hi!

01:04:40.243 --> 01:04:43.513
I was lost, and there was
a princess. There were...

01:09:13.247 --> 01:09:14.482
Vera...

01:09:15.884 --> 01:09:18.853
You've been in a coma
for eight months.

01:09:21.423 --> 01:09:24.130
You fell two stories,
you broke several bones,

01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:26.961
and your brain suffered some trauma.

01:09:28.029 --> 01:09:29.992
Now, we don't want you
to try speaking too much

01:09:30.091 --> 01:09:32.392
until the speech
therapist comes on Monday.

01:09:32.969 --> 01:09:34.902
Today's Saturday.

01:09:36.205 --> 01:09:37.604
Do you understand?

01:09:41.477 --> 01:09:44.381
Do you remember, you were
pregnant when it happened?

01:09:45.982 --> 01:09:47.548
Yeah.

01:09:48.417 --> 01:09:51.386
And you were pregnant the
night they brought you in.

01:09:52.955 --> 01:09:55.089
Were you aware of that?

01:10:19.515 --> 01:10:23.587
There's the head, the arms,

01:10:23.687 --> 01:10:25.720
and the heart.

01:10:35.698 --> 01:10:37.968
Easy, easy, easy. Easy. It's okay.

01:10:38.068 --> 01:10:39.569
- Get that out of me!
- Calm down.

01:10:39.669 --> 01:10:41.638
Get that thing out of me.
I want it out.

01:10:41.838 --> 01:10:44.142
I can arrange for you to talk
to someone about adoption,

01:10:44.274 --> 01:10:47.175
but you have to accept you're
gonna deliver this baby.

01:10:48.143 --> 01:10:51.345
No. Then I want a c-section.
Immediately.

01:11:50.138 --> 01:11:51.572
Sponge.

01:11:55.611 --> 01:11:57.114
I can feel something.

01:12:00.249 --> 01:12:02.585
- What do you feel?
- I don't know.

01:12:05.588 --> 01:12:08.556
It's okay to feel a kind of
pressure as we're working.

01:12:53.369 --> 01:12:56.303
Vera, would you like to see?

01:13:13.255 --> 01:13:14.689
Beautiful.

01:13:20.362 --> 01:13:22.699
Would you like to hold your baby?

01:13:23.699 --> 01:13:25.332
No.

01:15:43.872 --> 01:15:46.609
Now, this is new video
just coming in to us.

01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:52.548
This is incredible footage of the
devastation brought by this Tsunami.

01:15:52.648 --> 01:15:57.353
We are getting reports it is over
100 square miles of flooded area.

01:15:57.453 --> 01:16:01.791
One can only assume there are tens
of thousands of people displaced,

01:16:01.891 --> 01:16:06.329
this once thriving neighborhood,
as you can see, entirely underwater.

01:16:06.863 --> 01:16:11.100
Nearby wreckage of a once
middle-class community.

01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:13.770
As you can see here, gas lines
have been reported ruptured.

01:16:13.870 --> 01:16:18.577
In some areas, fires are
still raging out of control.

01:16:19.462 --> 01:16:22.075
You really shouldn't be watching that.

01:16:29.218 --> 01:16:33.156
Hey, baby, you're gonna have
that visitor in a few minutes.

01:16:33.656 --> 01:16:37.994
I guess she's driven a long way to meet
you, so I want you to be extra nice.

01:16:45.434 --> 01:16:46.869
I'm starting your mac and cheese.

01:16:53.943 --> 01:16:58.214
And doing their best, but looking at
these images, one can only guess...

01:18:09.217 --> 01:18:11.639
Come in. She's in the kitchen.

01:18:12.513 --> 01:18:16.214
I'll introduce you to her and
leave you alone for a while.

01:18:38.715 --> 01:18:41.948
Honey, this lady's name is Vera.

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:45.119
She came a long way because
she wanted to meet you.

01:18:49.859 --> 01:18:51.958
She's just real shy.

01:19:04.973 --> 01:19:07.475
- You want some tea?
- Yes. Thank you.

01:19:13.481 --> 01:19:17.250
Just holler if you need me.
I'm gonna go pick up your room.

01:19:34.469 --> 01:19:36.336
Do you know who I am?

01:19:41.543 --> 01:19:43.443
I'm your mother.

01:19:45.847 --> 01:19:48.014
They told me I was crazy.

01:19:48.683 --> 01:19:51.051
Put me on all these meds,

01:19:51.686 --> 01:19:55.989
said that I imagined things
and that's why I gave you up.

01:20:12.574 --> 01:20:14.808
I know about Hannah.

01:20:15.910 --> 01:20:17.244
I know she made a deal.

01:20:23.885 --> 01:20:26.587
After she killed herself,
you had nowhere to go.

01:20:28.089 --> 01:20:33.660
So you waited around for someone
else that you could get inside of.

01:20:37.265 --> 01:20:39.432
You killed my sister.

01:20:46.441 --> 01:20:48.541
Then you chose me.

01:20:54.883 --> 01:20:57.050
Why did you choose me?

01:21:04.826 --> 01:21:06.994
I know who you are.

01:23:11.219 --> 01:23:12.786
Come to me.

01:24:42.910 --> 01:24:44.309
No!

01:26:54.577 --> 01:26:56.111
Baby?

01:27:05.654 --> 01:27:06.720
Baby?

01:27:09.034 --> 01:27:10.560
Baby?!

01:27:22.670 --> 01:27:25.638
I knew you'd come back for me, mommy.

01:27:57.204 --> 01:28:00.209
<i>I saw a beast coming out of the sea.</i>

01:28:00.809 --> 01:28:03.911
<i>It deceived the inhabitants
of the earth...</i>

01:28:04.013 --> 01:28:08.684
<i>And forced all people to receive
a mark on their right hands,</i>

01:28:08.784 --> 01:28:11.052
<i>which is the number of the beast.</i>

01:28:11.353 --> 01:28:16.756
<i>And that number is 6-6-6.</i>

01:28:17.305 --> 01:28:23.660
