00:02.435 --> 00:05.038
 ( bell rings )

00:05.071 --> 00:08.341
<i>* When I wake up in the</i>
<i>morning and the alarm</i>
<i>gives out a warning</i>

00:08.375 --> 00:11.044
   <i>* I don't think</i>
   <i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:11.077 --> 00:13.947
 <i>* By the time I grab my books</i>
 <i>and I give myself a look</i>

00:13.980 --> 00:17.550

 <i>to see the bus fly by</i>

00:17.584 --> 00:21.054
  <i>* It's all right</i>
  <i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:23.456 --> 00:26.426
  <i>* If the teacher pops a test</i>

<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell *</i>

01:18.845 --> 01:21.448
  This history class
  is a kid's worst nightmare.

01:21.481 --> 01:23.783
  Our teacher, Mr. Dickerson,
  is more horrible

01:23.817 --> 01:26.853
than four zits
on a first date.

01:26.886 --> 01:29.889
 ( bell rings )

01:31.591 --> 01:33.426
  Good morning, Mr. Dickerson.

01:33.460 --> 01:35.095
Stop sucking up,
it won't work.

01:36.863 --> 01:39.632
Tomorrow is our
history midterm.

01:39.666 --> 01:43.636
  No one has passed it
  in three years.

01:45.105 --> 01:48.141
 This grade is important to me,
 I've got to get an A.

01:48.174 --> 01:50.777
  Sir, can we at least review
  what's gonna be on the test?

01:50.810 --> 01:52.912
 Okay.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.581
   Who shot Lincoln, Screech?

01:54.614 --> 01:56.016
 It wasn't me.

01:57.751 --> 01:58.852
   John Wilkes Booth.

01:58.885 --> 02:00.053
 Ford Theater.
 Where?

02:00.053 --> 02:01.421
 I865.
 Year?

02:01.454 --> 02:02.956
   President Johnson.
   Successor?

02:03.056 --> 02:05.058
-Which Johnson?
-Magic Johnson.

02:06.860 --> 02:08.328
   Laugh now, loser.

02:08.360 --> 02:11.064
  None of this is on the test.
  ( cackles )

02:11.865 --> 02:13.733
  PA: <i>Morning, class,</i>

02:13.767 --> 02:16.369
<i>this is your principal,</i>
<i>Mr. Belding.</i>

02:16.403 --> 02:18.938
  Stop interrupting my class!

02:18.972 --> 02:20.674
  <i>Would the class</i>
  <i>trip representatives</i>

02:20.707 --> 02:22.375
  <i>report to my</i>
  <i>office immediately?</i>

02:22.909 --> 02:24.344
   <i>Thank you.</i>

02:28.682 --> 02:31.584
Mr. Dickerson,
I don't want to
miss the review,

02:31.618 --> 02:34.454
 but this class trip is
 the biggest deal
 of the school year.

02:34.487 --> 02:35.555
  Go!

02:35.588 --> 02:36.790
   All right.

02:36.823 --> 02:40.760
 But the only trip this class
 will take is to summer school.

02:40.794 --> 02:42.362
  ( cackles )

02:45.699 --> 02:47.367
The highlight of
the school year

02:47.400 --> 02:49.502
 is taking you on
 the annual class trip.

02:49.536 --> 02:52.706
   Today we pick
   our destinations,
   so let's hear your ideas.

02:52.739 --> 02:55.108
 I think we should visit
 the Hershey Chocolate Factory.

02:57.143 --> 02:58.945
  Fat chance, Milton.

03:00.547 --> 03:02.382
  Why don't we take
  a cruise to Hawaii?

03:02.415 --> 03:05.418
 We don't have enough money
 to take the class on a cruise.

03:05.452 --> 03:06.786
Well then, just send me.

03:09.389 --> 03:10.857
 We should do
 something significant.

03:10.890 --> 03:12.892
 Let's picket
 a nuclear power plant.

03:12.926 --> 03:14.761
Why don't you save that
for your honeymoon?

03:16.429 --> 03:17.597
( kids arguing )

03:17.630 --> 03:19.899
Belding: Please! Please!

03:19.933 --> 03:23.737
  This trip can be educational
  and fun at the same time.

03:23.770 --> 03:25.071
 Let's go to Las Vegas.

03:25.071 --> 03:27.741
 We can study the Roman Empire
 at Caesar's Palace.

03:29.576 --> 03:31.111
   Let's go to
   the Hostess Museum,

03:31.144 --> 03:32.879
   l hear they have a great
   Ding Dong exhibit.

03:34.781 --> 03:36.583
  You're a ding-dong, Milton.

03:36.616 --> 03:37.884
  ( arguing )

03:37.917 --> 03:39.119
   Belding: Hold it. Hold it!

03:39.152 --> 03:41.821
   Hold...it!

03:41.855 --> 03:43.656
 Since we can't agree,
 I'll pick

03:43.690 --> 03:45.992
  a place I'm sure
  everyone will like.

03:46.092 --> 03:47.627
 That sounds fair, Mr. Belding.

03:47.660 --> 03:49.129
In the meantime,
hit those books

03:49.162 --> 03:50.797
because if you
don't pass your midterms

03:50.830 --> 03:52.766
   there'll be no class trip
   for any of you.

03:58.805 --> 04:02.409
   Jessie, was
   Archduke Francis Ferdinand
   assassinated at Sarajevo?

04:02.942 --> 04:04.511
 Yes, very good, Zack.

04:04.544 --> 04:06.579
  All right, and that started
  World War l.

04:06.613 --> 04:08.815
  I thought it was
  'cause everyone
  was shooting at each other.

04:10.850 --> 04:12.886
  Stop fooling around,
  you simp.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.587
Oh, thanks,
I had a fly on my head.

04:16.456 --> 04:20.459
  Zack, I am really impressed.
  You really are
  serious about this test.

04:20.493 --> 04:22.395
Not the test, the trip.

04:22.429 --> 04:26.066
 I heard that Dickerson
 flunked his own kid last year.

04:26.066 --> 04:28.702
Come on,
guys, all we have to do
is study the material

04:28.735 --> 04:31.104
  and Dickerson can't stop us
  from going on the trip.

04:31.137 --> 04:32.772
 Zack's right.

04:34.774 --> 04:37.610
   You'll never pass
   my test, Zackie.

04:41.147 --> 04:42.816
Psst...

04:42.849 --> 04:45.785
 Your looks won't
 get you through
 this one, cheerleader.

04:48.154 --> 04:51.424
   F. F. F.
   You're both getting an F.

04:53.927 --> 04:56.396
I need a break.

04:56.429 --> 04:57.997
    Yeah, let's watch
   <i>Fresh Prince.</i>

05:00.600 --> 05:02.769
<i>* You think you're smart</i>
<i>You think you're hip</i>

05:02.802 --> 05:05.505
 <i>* Put your books away,</i>
 <i>'cause there's</i>
 <i>no class trip *</i>

05:12.545 --> 05:14.381
 It's been almost five minutes
 since the bell rang.

05:14.414 --> 05:16.049
  Where do you
  think Dickerson is?

05:16.082 --> 05:17.517
I hope nothing
happened to him.

05:20.620 --> 05:24.958
   All right, look everybody,
   if Dickerson's not
   here in 30 seconds,

05:25.058 --> 05:27.093
 I'm invoking
 the five-minute rule.

05:27.127 --> 05:28.928
  What's the five-minute rule?

05:28.962 --> 05:31.064
  If a teacher doesn't show up
  within five
  minutes of the bell,

05:31.097 --> 05:32.632
   everyone is free to leave.

05:33.566 --> 05:35.335
 I've never heard of that rule.

05:35.368 --> 05:37.504
All right,
there's 10 seconds left.

05:37.537 --> 05:40.807
   All: 10...
   Nine, eight, seven, six...

05:40.840 --> 05:43.076
 Five-minute rule, eh, Morris?

05:43.076 --> 05:44.744
   How'd you know?
   I just made it up.

05:46.846 --> 05:49.716
Class, Mr. Dickerson
will not be here today.

05:49.749 --> 05:51.117
( all cheering )

05:52.385 --> 05:54.587
  Gee, that's too bad,
  what happened?

05:54.621 --> 05:57.090
Well...

05:57.090 --> 06:00.527
He came into
the teachers' lounge
and gave everybody an F.

06:00.560 --> 06:04.297
 I knew he needed a rest
 when he sent me to detention.

06:04.330 --> 06:06.066
   Does that mean we don't
   have to take his midterm?

06:07.701 --> 06:09.636
  Whoa...whoa.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.905
  No.

06:11.938 --> 06:14.774
  The test will be given by
  our substitute teacher, Mr.
  Belding.

06:16.509 --> 06:19.946
 I think you're losing it, sir.
 You're Mr. Belding.

06:20.046 --> 06:23.550
   This is also Mr. Belding.
   This is my brother,
   Rod Belding.

06:24.951 --> 06:27.620
Get out of here.

06:27.654 --> 06:30.323
  He's right, I'm his brother.
  I'll take over
  from here, Richie.

06:30.824 --> 06:34.060
 It's Richard, Rodney.

06:34.094 --> 06:37.497
  I can't believe it,
  two Beldings in one school.

06:37.530 --> 06:41.067
 Wow,
 a building with two Beldings,
 one of whom is balding.

06:44.471 --> 06:46.806
Just so there
won't be any confusion,
call me Rod.

06:49.476 --> 06:50.610
 Whoa.

06:51.544 --> 06:54.848
  This test looks pretty hard.

06:54.881 --> 06:57.684
  I heard if you don't pass it
  you can't go on
  the class trip.

06:57.717 --> 07:00.020
  That's just
  an ugly rumor, sir.

07:00.053 --> 07:02.689
I don't want to be
part of any ugly rumor.

07:02.722 --> 07:05.925
   Instead of taking history,
   let's make some history.

07:06.026 --> 07:08.795
  Everybody pick up your test,
  and do what I do.

07:11.898 --> 07:13.867
All: Woo-hoo!
Woo-hoo!

07:16.670 --> 07:18.038
I love this guy.

07:23.209 --> 07:25.078
  Please, call me Rod.
  Mr. Belding?

07:26.212 --> 07:28.214
   Okay, Rod.

07:28.248 --> 07:31.317
 What about our
 grades on the midterm?
 I have to get an A.

07:31.351 --> 07:32.886
  Okay, you got an A.

07:34.921 --> 07:36.356
   I'll have an A also, Rod.

07:38.224 --> 07:40.293
You're gonna give us
whatever grade we want?

07:40.326 --> 07:43.196
 No,
 I'm giving you whatever grade
 you think you deserve.

07:43.930 --> 07:45.231
  Then I'll take an A.

07:45.265 --> 07:46.900
  Wow! I thought
  the first time I kissed Zack

07:46.933 --> 07:48.234
   was the happiest
   moment of my life.

07:48.268 --> 07:49.936
 Oops!
 Kelly.

07:51.237 --> 07:54.074
 Put me down for an A+,
 Rod, honey.

07:54.607 --> 07:56.409
   Okay, Rod.

07:56.443 --> 08:00.046
 Now is this on the level here?
 Are you for real?

08:00.080 --> 08:03.850
 I believe
 teacher-student relationships
 should be based on trust.

08:04.551 --> 08:06.853
   Now, what do you deserve?

08:06.886 --> 08:08.388
 Trust me,
 sir, definitely an A.

08:10.557 --> 08:13.126
  Mr. Rod,
  sir, I have a real problem.

08:13.159 --> 08:16.196
  My heart says A,
  but my head says C+.

08:16.229 --> 08:18.565
  And my lips say
  you're brain dead
  if you take the C+.

08:20.467 --> 08:22.369
What's it gonna be, son?

08:22.402 --> 08:24.371
   Okay, I'll go for it, B-.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.276
So, I said to
the head of the airline,

08:30.310 --> 08:32.445
"Now make somebody else
a vice-president,

08:32.479 --> 08:34.813
 "I need my summers off
 to follow my dreams."

08:37.049 --> 08:38.952
   Being a substitute teacher
   is perfect,

08:39.052 --> 08:41.154
   I get the same
   vacation you guys do
   and none of the homework.

08:43.222 --> 08:44.524
How's it going in here?

08:44.557 --> 08:47.093
 Radical, Richie dude.

08:47.127 --> 08:50.830
   Mr. Belding, your brother
   is the best
   teacher I've ever had.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.098
   All: Yes.

08:52.132 --> 08:53.366
  Yeah, you're nothing alike.

08:56.102 --> 08:57.871
 It's hard to believe
 you're even brothers.

08:59.439 --> 09:03.343
 What he's trying to say, sir,
 is that you're both so...

09:03.376 --> 09:06.012
   So...so different.

09:06.012 --> 09:08.481
  Yeah, he's got so much more
  hair than you do, sir.

09:11.384 --> 09:14.020
Oh, but you have
a much bigger forehead.

09:16.256 --> 09:18.391
  Thank you for bringing that
  to my attention.

09:19.225 --> 09:21.127
 Now for the big news.

09:21.161 --> 09:23.797
   I have decided where
   we're going for our trip.

09:24.564 --> 09:25.799
   Zack: Really? Where, sir?

09:25.832 --> 09:27.167
Ready for this?

09:27.200 --> 09:30.036
We're going to camp out
under the stars

09:30.036 --> 09:32.038
   at Yosemite National Park.

09:32.038 --> 09:33.940
All: All right.

09:34.040 --> 09:35.875
 Yosemite, that could be good.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.811
 Yeah, I like it, Mr. Belding.

09:41.181 --> 09:42.482
   You guys are really brave.

09:43.550 --> 09:45.151
   What do you mean?

09:45.185 --> 09:47.053
   You're letting my brother
   lead you into the woods.

09:47.053 --> 09:49.522
 When he was I 2 we camped out
 on the front lawn,
 he got lost.

09:54.160 --> 09:55.228
  Yes, there it goes.

09:55.261 --> 09:56.463
   Home run!

09:56.496 --> 09:58.898
   All right, yes.
   Great game, guys.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.835
  You guys having a good time?

10:01.868 --> 10:03.970
 Yeah, but what if Mr. Belding
 catches us in here

10:04.004 --> 10:05.438
   watching the Dodger game?

10:05.472 --> 10:08.174
  You're right, he'll be mad,
  he's a Giants fan.

10:10.076 --> 10:11.578
Stop worrying,
he's at
a school board meeting.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.848
 Rod, you're the best.
 You're not like
 a teacher at all.

10:14.881 --> 10:16.316
  You're like one of the guys.

10:17.083 --> 10:18.385
Check this out.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.254
   ( clears throat )

10:21.287 --> 10:22.622
 Will
 the prettiest girls in school

10:22.655 --> 10:24.591
   please report
   to the principals' office

10:24.624 --> 10:27.293
immediately
for some chips and dip?

10:28.895 --> 10:30.263
   Come on, Zack, cut it out.

10:30.296 --> 10:32.532
  I'm just playing principal.
  I didn't press the button.

10:33.266 --> 10:36.069
 Oh...now it's my turn.

10:36.102 --> 10:38.004
 I do a great Belding.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.074
Zack, sit down.

10:41.107 --> 10:41.975
 Okay.

10:43.543 --> 10:46.346
  I think it's time
  we had a man-to-man,

10:46.379 --> 10:47.947
guy-to-guy talk.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.550
Remember
the last three letters
of principal spell pal.

10:53.119 --> 10:54.320
 Now...

10:55.355 --> 10:57.123
Screech, you all right?

10:57.957 --> 10:59.292
  Yeah. Whoa!

11:01.261 --> 11:03.063
   Oh, just kidding.

11:03.096 --> 11:05.098
You really do remind me
of my brother.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.069
 You guys excited
 about the class trip?

11:09.069 --> 11:11.071
 Oh, man, I can't wait.

11:11.071 --> 11:14.908
Imagine,
sitting under the stars,

11:14.941 --> 11:17.277
  cuddling with Kelly
  around a campfire.

11:17.310 --> 11:18.511
   ( sighs )

11:18.545 --> 11:20.080
  I don't need
  a girl to keep warm.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.981
  Mom's packing
  three pairs of long johns...

11:23.616 --> 11:25.618
  With a lock on the trapdoor
  to keep the bears out.

11:27.954 --> 11:30.423
   I'll never
   forget our class trip,
   it was the greatest ever.

11:30.457 --> 11:31.458
  We went white-water rafting.

11:31.491 --> 11:33.093
Really?

11:33.126 --> 11:34.260
 I've always wanted to do that.

11:34.294 --> 11:36.096
There's nothing like it.

11:36.096 --> 11:37.597
  Shooting the rapids,
  taking risks,

11:37.630 --> 11:39.366
 you're pushing
 yourself to the limit.

11:39.399 --> 11:41.434
 I know exactly what you mean.

11:41.468 --> 11:44.137
   I felt that way
   the first time I rode the
   teacups at Disneyland.

11:45.605 --> 11:48.008
I'd give anything to go
white-water rafting.

11:48.108 --> 11:50.610
I don't blame you, Zack.
You gotta grab life.

11:50.643 --> 11:52.412
 What are you
 gonna do at Yosemite?

11:52.445 --> 11:54.581
  Walk around trees
  and chase squirrels.

11:54.614 --> 11:56.950
Rod, Belding would never
take us rafting.

11:56.983 --> 11:59.419
That Belding wouldn't,
but this Belding would.

12:01.121 --> 12:02.822
  Yeah.
  White-water rafting?

12:02.856 --> 12:05.291
  It'll be a trip
  we'll never forget, Jessie.

12:05.325 --> 12:08.528
I've done it, Mama,
it's the greatest
thrill you've ever had.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.563
  Well, except for dating me,
  of course.

12:12.198 --> 12:16.136
Oh, please.
Should I throw up now,
or save it for the raft?

12:16.169 --> 12:19.139
I'm gonna save
it for the raft.

12:19.172 --> 12:22.842
  I've heard it's
  really exciting,
  like a spike in volleyball.

12:22.876 --> 12:26.212
 I'm gonna do
 nothing but kick back
 and look at beautiful scenery.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.081
If you want
beautiful scenery, baby,

12:28.081 --> 12:30.116
  wait till you see
  me in a wet T-shirt.

12:30.150 --> 12:34.187
  If it means you're drowning,
  count me in.

12:35.288 --> 12:36.923
 Come on,
 guys, let's go for it.

12:36.956 --> 12:38.324
 Wait a minute, wait a minute.

12:38.358 --> 12:41.094
  We all agreed to go camping
  with Mr. Belding.

12:41.127 --> 12:43.530
 Then let's ask him
 if we can go rafting instead.

12:46.633 --> 12:48.568
  Come in.
  ( knocking on door )

12:51.137 --> 12:54.107
 Mr. Belding, we'd like
 to talk to you
 about the class trip.

12:54.107 --> 12:57.110
  Absolutely.
  It's gonna be great
  spending time with you guys.

12:57.143 --> 12:59.946
  Look, I've already got
  the first two days planned.

13:00.046 --> 13:01.114
Well, you see...

13:01.147 --> 13:02.182
   Wait till you hear this...

13:02.215 --> 13:04.551
  We get up at
  dawn for the sunrise

13:04.584 --> 13:07.053
 and we hike to Yosemite Falls

13:07.087 --> 13:09.856
 and we watch the deer
 come down and drink.

13:09.889 --> 13:11.891
  That's so sweet.
  Huh?

13:11.925 --> 13:13.226
 I think I'm gonna cry.

13:13.259 --> 13:15.061
Stop it.

13:15.061 --> 13:17.464
   Then we go on
   a wildflower walk

13:17.497 --> 13:19.966
  in the middle of the valley
  and have lunch...

13:20.066 --> 13:23.169
  Oh, you are gonna love this,
  in the Indian caves.

13:23.203 --> 13:24.537
   But, Mr. Belding...

13:24.571 --> 13:25.972
  Is something wrong, Slater?

13:26.072 --> 13:27.874
 Well no, it...

13:27.907 --> 13:29.509
   It all sounds great, sir.

13:29.542 --> 13:33.179
  What Slater's trying to say
  is that Yosemite
  seems beautiful

13:33.213 --> 13:35.248
and peaceful and... Zack?

13:36.082 --> 13:38.385
 Actually, Mr. Belding,

13:38.418 --> 13:41.588
 I don't exactly
 know how to say this.

13:41.621 --> 13:43.223
 It's easy, tell him, Screech.

13:43.256 --> 13:45.091
  We don't wanna go
  on your boring nature trip,

13:45.091 --> 13:46.493
  we wanna go
  white-water rafting.

13:49.462 --> 13:52.932
   Rafting? Is this true?
   Do you all feel this way?

13:52.966 --> 13:55.101
   You see, Mr. B,
   we only have
   one big class trip

13:55.101 --> 13:57.470
   and we all want
   to do something
   more challenging.

13:57.504 --> 14:00.473
I understand that,
but I don't know
anything about rafting.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.375
 Don't worry about it, sir.
  It can be dangerous.

14:02.409 --> 14:04.944
   Your brother is an expert
   and offered to take us.

14:06.046 --> 14:08.148
   Oh, I see.

14:08.181 --> 14:11.451
   What you're saying is that
   all of you would
   like to go with him.

14:11.484 --> 14:13.086
  Mr.
  Belding, it's a great chance

14:13.119 --> 14:14.454
  to really find out
  what we're made of.

14:14.487 --> 14:16.056
  Zack: That's right.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.891
  Of course I want you
  to have the best trip ever,

14:17.924 --> 14:20.060
and if you all
feel this way...

14:22.062 --> 14:23.129
  Yeah, sure.

14:23.163 --> 14:24.497
All: All right.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.433
Slater: Thanks, Mr. B.
Screech: All right, Mr.
Belding.

14:40.146 --> 14:42.082
Let's pretend
this is the real thing.

14:44.250 --> 14:46.219
 We're heading for white water.

14:46.252 --> 14:47.821
   Everybody hold on.

14:48.855 --> 14:50.490
   All: Whoa!

14:54.427 --> 14:58.331
  Hey, Kelly,
  look at the mountains
  and the trees.

14:58.365 --> 14:59.833
 Oh, there's
 a deer drinking water.

14:59.866 --> 15:01.534
 Where? Where?

15:03.670 --> 15:05.271
 It's pretend.

15:05.305 --> 15:08.808
  If it's pretend, why am l
  getting seasick? ( groans )

15:08.842 --> 15:11.378
 Because when you were little,
 your daddy
 bounced you on his knee

15:11.411 --> 15:13.179
and the ceiling was low.

15:14.114 --> 15:15.315
Okay, everybody hold on.

15:15.348 --> 15:17.050
   ( group gasping )

15:17.083 --> 15:18.818
  ( whimpers )

15:25.425 --> 15:27.193
  Lisa, I can't swim.

15:28.661 --> 15:29.696
 Okay, here comes the big one.

15:29.729 --> 15:30.797
  ( girls screaming )

15:33.366 --> 15:34.601
Rod: Okay, okay.

15:34.634 --> 15:36.069
 Slater: Whoa.

15:39.372 --> 15:41.675
  This is a good time
  to demonstrate
  lifesaving skills.

15:41.708 --> 15:42.809
Any volunteers?

15:42.842 --> 15:44.310
 Sure.

15:44.344 --> 15:46.413
  Sir, I'm an expert
  on mouth-to-mouth.

15:46.446 --> 15:47.847
  Right, Mama?

15:52.318 --> 15:53.753
Don't flatter yourself.

15:55.155 --> 15:57.457
   You're just okay.

15:57.490 --> 15:59.426
That's not what you said
Saturday night.

16:02.395 --> 16:05.365
  Okay. You two ladies
  lie on the floor.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.503
   Rod: Guys,
   kneel next to the victim.

16:14.207 --> 16:18.678
  Okay, now Zack,
  put your hand
  under Kelly's neck.

16:19.346 --> 16:20.513
   Like this?

16:20.547 --> 16:22.248
  Good, and elevate her chin.

16:22.282 --> 16:24.751
 Okay.
 Good. You too, Slater.

16:24.784 --> 16:27.387
   Now take a breath,
   go for it.

16:30.423 --> 16:32.092
Both: All right!

16:33.226 --> 16:36.796
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
What is going on here?

16:36.830 --> 16:39.065
   I'm drowning
   and nobody cares!

16:41.134 --> 16:43.403
  I hope there's
  a good explanation for this.

16:43.436 --> 16:45.605
  Richard.
  There is, Richie...

16:45.638 --> 16:46.806
   The boys were
   demonstrating CPR.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.508
 Yeah.

16:48.541 --> 16:50.543
  Looks like they were
  making out to me.

16:50.577 --> 16:52.846
Besides, you're supposed
to be in history class.

16:52.879 --> 16:54.848
 Stop being so uptight.

16:54.881 --> 16:56.416
We're just using
some class time

16:56.449 --> 16:58.551
  to prepare for
  this Friday's trip.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.620
  Take your class to the room.

17:01.521 --> 17:02.756
  ( everyone groans )

17:02.789 --> 17:04.290
  Come on, everybody.

17:08.127 --> 17:11.765
 Mr.
 Belding, don't be mad at Rod,
 he's a great teacher.

17:11.798 --> 17:14.134
  Yeah.
  Rod?

17:14.166 --> 17:16.770
No other teacher ever
cared so much about us.

17:16.803 --> 17:19.105
Maybe he should
care more about teaching

17:19.138 --> 17:21.174
 and less about
 being popular.

17:21.207 --> 17:23.076
  Maybe you're jealous
  of your own brother.

17:31.284 --> 17:33.186
Tonight we head
for the Colorado River.

17:33.219 --> 17:36.189
   I finally found
   a subject l love,
   leaving school.

17:38.258 --> 17:41.761
  Don't worry, Jessie, if you
  fall overboard,
  I'll rescue you.

17:45.699 --> 17:48.435
   Someone should rescue you
   from your macho fantasies.

17:50.603 --> 17:53.440
  You know,
  Kelly, this is gonna be
  the best week of our lives.

17:53.473 --> 17:55.175
   No studying, no homework.

17:55.208 --> 17:57.310
Zack, that is your life.

17:57.344 --> 18:00.146
  No, I mean one week
  away from everything

18:00.180 --> 18:02.148
   except my favorite person
   in the world.

18:14.794 --> 18:16.229
 I'm not gonna drown this time.

18:16.262 --> 18:17.464
  ( squeaks )

18:19.132 --> 18:21.301
  Hey, everybody,
  the buses are here.

18:21.334 --> 18:22.669
All right, yeah.

18:22.702 --> 18:24.237
But where's Rod?

18:24.270 --> 18:25.672
 I'll go look for him.

18:35.482 --> 18:37.650
   Belding: I cannot believe
   you're doing this.

18:37.684 --> 18:40.620
The class trip
leaves in five minutes.

18:40.653 --> 18:42.222
   These kids are
   depending on you.

18:42.255 --> 18:44.324
  Come on, Richie,
  they'll get over it.

18:44.357 --> 18:46.092
  They look up to you.

18:46.126 --> 18:49.195
  What is so important
  that you would
  disappoint 30 kids?

18:49.229 --> 18:52.399
  Richie,
  if you met this stewardess,
  you'd know.

18:52.432 --> 18:54.768
 You're doing
 this to spend time
 with some stewardess?

18:54.801 --> 18:58.338
 It's not just some stewardess,
 this is Inga.

18:58.371 --> 19:00.173
 And she's only in town
 for the weekend.

19:00.206 --> 19:01.274
  See, I knew.

19:01.307 --> 19:04.577
 I knew it was a mistake
 to let you come to my school.

19:04.611 --> 19:06.613
You promised me
you had changed,

19:06.646 --> 19:08.715
 but no, you are the same Rod.

19:08.748 --> 19:11.184
  You get people's hopes up
  and then you let them down.

19:11.217 --> 19:14.287
Richie, she's gorgeous.
You should see her,
she's a 10.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.322
  Is that what
  you're gonna tell the kids?

19:16.356 --> 19:18.792
That you dumped them
for some weekend fling?

19:18.825 --> 19:21.594
  Of course not.
  Tell them I'm sick.

19:21.628 --> 19:24.130
  Tell them anything,
  cover for me.

19:24.164 --> 19:25.732
 I'm tired of covering for you.

19:27.100 --> 19:29.169
 Come on, Richie,
 don't be mad, we're brothers.

19:32.172 --> 19:33.740
   Get out of my school, Rod.

19:52.726 --> 19:54.527
Zack, are you all right?

19:54.561 --> 19:56.563
What's wrong?
I'm not feeling
so good, Kelly.

19:59.566 --> 20:02.102
Excuse me, could I have
your attention please?

20:02.135 --> 20:05.438
 Would everyone gather around?
 I have
 an announcement to make.

20:08.875 --> 20:12.612
 Unfortunately, my brother Rod
 cannot take you
 on the class trip.

20:13.313 --> 20:14.647
   All: What?

20:15.648 --> 20:16.683
  He can't go?

20:16.716 --> 20:18.151
Why not?

20:18.184 --> 20:19.619
 Well, he's...

20:20.320 --> 20:21.688
He has the flu.

20:21.721 --> 20:25.458
   He is very, very sorry
   to disappoint all of you.

20:25.492 --> 20:27.827
Great, I guess we won't
be going anywhere now.

20:27.861 --> 20:29.596
   ( murmuring )
   Yeah, let's go home, guys.

20:29.629 --> 20:32.165
 See you later, Mr. B.

20:32.198 --> 20:35.435
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hold it,
hold it, wait a minute.

20:35.468 --> 20:38.838
   Look, I may not be a great
   rafting expert like Rod,

20:38.872 --> 20:40.607
 or even as cool a guy,

20:40.640 --> 20:44.277
  but I'd like to try
  and take his place.

20:45.512 --> 20:47.447
  You mean,
  you want to take us?

20:47.480 --> 20:50.517
   Yeah,
   if you don't mind a leader
   who can't swim too well.

20:52.152 --> 20:53.219
Let's go rafting, Mr. B.

20:53.253 --> 20:54.354
   All: Yeah!

20:56.456 --> 20:58.291
We'll have a great time,
Mr. Belding.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.228
   Sure.
   Thank you.

21:04.531 --> 21:06.332
I'll see you on the bus.

21:06.800 --> 21:08.635
  Mr. Belding?

21:08.668 --> 21:10.603
  Why didn't you
  tell them the truth?

21:10.637 --> 21:11.738
   What do you mean?

21:11.771 --> 21:13.073
 About the stewardess?

21:13.673 --> 21:14.808
  I heard everything.

21:14.841 --> 21:16.276
  Oh, you did?

21:16.309 --> 21:18.278
  Everything.

21:18.311 --> 21:20.180
 Look, I'm sorry
 you had to hear that.

21:20.814 --> 21:22.415
I know how much
Rod meant to you

21:22.449 --> 21:24.351
   and I didn't
   want to ruin that.

21:24.384 --> 21:26.519
   Sir, I acted like a jerk.

21:28.188 --> 21:29.522
I'm sorry for the things
I said to you.

21:30.557 --> 21:32.225
  I understand, Zack.

21:32.258 --> 21:34.094
   Rod always was
   the more exciting Belding.

21:35.261 --> 21:37.764
 Maybe.
 But we got the better Belding.
